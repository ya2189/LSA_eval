you
gaze
up
a
railroad
track
said
varensky
always
a
point
in
the
infinite
distance
where
just
before
they
vanish
the
parallel
rails
seem
to
join
if
a
train
were
ever
to
reach
that
point
it
would
mean
death
like
that
a
track
along
which
we
travel
on
the
parallel
rails
of
possibility
and
desire
the
lure
of
the
idealist
is
to
overtake
the
illusion
where
possibility
and
desire
seem
to
merge

chapter
the
first
the
disappearance
of
a
patriot
i
prince
rogovich
prince
rogovich
staring
up
at
the
clammy
wall
of
the
liner
blanched
by
searchlights
against
which
the
little
tug
bumped
and
jostled
philip
hindwood
could
hear
the
prince
name
being
shouted
in
staterooms
along
decks
and
passageways
it
had
been
midnight
when
they
had
drifted
like
a
gallivanting
hotel
all
portholes
ablaze
into
the
starlit
vagueness
of
plymouth
harbor
the
did
not
dock
there
she
only
halted
long
enough
to
put
off
the
english
passengers
and
to
drop
the
english
mail
there
had
been
three
passengers
to
land
of
whom
hindwood
had
been
the
first
the
rest
were
disembarking
at
boulogne
or
rotterdam
they
had
been
met
just
outside
the
harbor
by
the
tug
and
the
transshipping
of
the
mail
had
immediately
commenced
the
last
bag
had
been
tossed
over
the
side
the
immigration
officials
had
completed
their
inspection
santa
gorlof
the
second
passenger
for
england
radiantly
smiling
above
her
sables
had
come
down
the
gangplank
it
was
for
the
third
passenger
that
the
liner
delayed
and
the
tug
still
waited
rogovich
prince
rogovich
the
cries
were
becoming
more
insistent
and
impatient
they
broke
on
the
stillness
with
the
monotony
of
despair
to
judge
by
the
sound
every
soul
aboard
the
liner
had
taken
up
the
search
from
the
firemen
in
the
to
the
marconi
men
on
the
top
deck
even
the
thud
of
the
engines
seemed
ominous
like
the
pounding
of
a
heart
stifled
with
foreboding
across
the
velvety
expanse
of
water
as
though
they
had
a
secret
they
were
trying
to
communicate
shore
lights
winked
and
twinkled
they
seemed
to
be
signaling
the
information
that
no
matter
how
long
the
search
was
maintained
prince
rogovich
would
not
be
found
that
night
ii
except
for
this
last
disturbing
incident
it
had
been
a
pleasant
voyage
the
most
pleasant
philip
hindwood
could
remember
they
had
left
new
york
in
the
brilliant
clearness
of
blue
september
skies
the
clear
blueness
had
followed
them
the
matronly
had
steamed
on
an
even
keel
through
seas
as
tranquil
and
reflective
as
the
proverbial
her
company
had
been
dull
consisting
mainly
of
american
drummers
and
dutch
colonials
returning
from
java
but
he
had
no
grounds
for
complaint
he
had
chosen
her
for
her
dullness
he
had
wanted
to
lay
up
a
store
of
rest
before
plunging
into
the
strenuous
excitements
which
were
the
purpose
of
his
journey
he
had
gone
aboard
her
in
an
unsociable
frame
of
mind
determined
to
talk
to
nobody
the
success
of
his
errand
depended
on
his
silence
he
believed
that
he
was
half
a
year
ahead
of
the
times
when
his
rivals
had
caught
up
to
where
he
was
at
present
he
would
have
made
himself
a
world
power
and
dictator
but
the
dullness
of
the
ship
company
had
exceeded
expectations
because
of
this
he
had
broken
his
compact
and
allowed
his
privacy
to
be
invaded
by
two
vivid
personalities
the
first
had
been
prince
rogovich
the
second
santa
gorlof
prince
rogovich
had
evidently
boarded
the
ship
with
precisely
the
same
intentions
as
himself
all
his
meals
had
been
served
in
his
stateroom
it
had
not
been
until
the
evening
of
the
third
day
that
he
had
appeared
on
deck
he
was
a
man
of
commanding
height
lean
of
hip
and
contemptuous
of
eye
with
the
disquieting
haughty
reticence
of
an
inscrutable
pharaoh
there
was
something
alluring
and
oriental
about
the
man
at
once
sinister
and
charming
behind
his
silky
black
beard
he
hid
a
face
which
was
deathly
white
its
pallor
was
not
of
but
of
passion
it
was
easy
to
believe
all
the
rumors
about
him
both
as
regarded
his
diabolical
cleverness
and
his
sensual
cruelty
his
enemies
were
legion
even
among
his
countrymen
he
could
count
few
friends
although
he
was
reckoned
their
greatest
patriot
in
poland
he
was
suspected
as
much
as
he
was
admired
and
was
accused
of
intriguing
in
order
that
he
might
set
up
a
throne
for
himself
the
object
of
his
flying
visit
to
america
had
been
to
consult
financial
magnates
on
the
advisability
of
floating
an
international
loan
in
the
interests
of
poland
there
were
men
the
world
over
and
in
russia
especially
who
would
have
paid
a
king
ransom
for
advance
information
as
to
what
answer
the
financiers
had
returned
though
hindwood
would
not
have
claimed
as
much
he
and
the
prince
were
two
of
a
kind
equally
magnificent
in
their
dreams
equally
relentless
in
their
means
of
realization
and
equally
insatiable
in
their
instinct
for
conquest
their
difference
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
polish
aristocrat
had
already
attained
the
goal
toward
which
the
american
was
no
more
than
striving
their
first
meeting
had
happened
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
hindwood
being
unable
to
sleep
had
partly
dressed
and
gone
on
deck
there
in
the
grayness
of
the
dawn
he
had
espied
a
tall
figure
slowly
pacing
accompanied
by
a
russian
wolfhound
it
was
the
remarkable
grace
of
the
man
that
had
first
held
him
his
faculty
for
stillness
his
spectral
paleness
his
padded
tread
but
the
moment
he
had
approached
him
the
sense
of
his
grace
had
been
obscured
by
an
atmosphere
of
menace
so
sinister
was
his
beauty
that
it
had
required
an
effort
to
pass
him
twice
secretly
hindwood
had
observed
him
he
was
like
his
hound
treacherously
languid
insolently
fastidious
and
bred
to
the
point
of
emaciation
but
his
languor
was
the
disguise
of
a
hidden
fierceness
which
betrayed
itself
in
his
red
curved
lips
and
the
marble
coldness
of
his
stare
it
was
at
the
third
time
of
passing
when
he
had
all
but
gone
by
him
that
he
had
heard
his
name
spoken
then
as
he
had
turned
the
famous
railroad
expert
am
i
right
it
fortunate
we
should
have
met
i
missed
you
in
america
so
you
too
are
among
the
sleepless
then
and
there
had
started
the
first
of
those
amazing
conversations
which
had
held
hindwood
fascinated
for
the
remainder
of
the
voyage
it
had
made
no
difference
that
in
his
heart
he
had
almost
hated
the
man
hated
his
ruthlessness
his
subtlety
his
polished
immorality
the
moment
he
commenced
to
talk
he
surrendered
to
his
spell
their
encounters
had
taken
place
for
the
most
part
between
midnight
and
sunrise
to
be
his
companion
was
like
eavesdropping
on
the
intimate
counsels
of
all
the
cabinets
of
europe
or
like
reading
your
daily
paper
a
year
before
it
was
published
for
the
rest
of
mankind
on
matters
which
did
not
concern
him
the
prince
could
be
brilliantly
confessional
indiscretion
was
the
bait
with
which
he
lured
his
victims
to
reveal
themselves
the
secrets
which
were
his
own
he
kept
never
once
did
he
drop
a
hint
that
would
indicate
the
success
or
failure
of
his
recent
mission
the
single
time
that
santa
gorlof
had
asked
him
his
dark
eyes
had
become
focusless
as
opals
and
his
white
face
under
its
silky
covering
of
beard
unnoticing
and
it
was
then
that
hindwood
had
recognized
the
resemblance
to
pharaoh
in
his
tyrannic
immobility
and
silence
and
santa
gorlof
there
was
a
woman
mysterious
exotic
mythical
compared
with
her
the
prince
was
an
open
book
from
the
start
she
had
made
no
attempt
to
explain
herself
had
referred
neither
to
her
past
nor
her
future
had
offered
no
credentials
she
had
imposed
herself
on
like
a
goddess
who
expected
to
be
worshiped
she
had
swept
him
off
his
feet
beaten
aside
his
caution
and
reached
his
heart
before
he
was
aware
but
was
it
his
heart
how
often
in
the
past
few
days
he
had
asked
himself
that
question
he
did
want
to
believe
that
it
was
his
heart
he
was
a
man
who
rode
alone
his
aloneness
was
the
reason
for
his
swiftness
he
had
been
tricked
once
by
a
woman
that
was
when
he
was
a
boy
now
he
was
a
man
nearing
forty
she
had
cheated
him
so
cruelly
that
though
she
had
been
dead
many
years
the
bitterness
still
rankled
behind
the
beauty
of
all
women
his
skepticism
detected
the
shallow
loveliness
of
the
one
false
woman
who
had
stolen
his
idealism
that
she
might
trample
on
it
he
did
not
love
santa
he
had
assured
himself
a
thousand
times
that
he
did
not
love
her
she
was
too
dangerous
too
incalculable
he
had
spent
long
hours
of
wakeful
nights
in
completing
the
inventory
of
her
bad
points
and
yet
while
he
had
been
with
her
his
veins
had
run
fire
while
he
had
been
apart
from
her
all
his
pleasures
had
seemed
tasteless
who
was
she
whence
had
she
come
whither
was
she
going
what
had
been
her
business
on
the
and
what
had
prince
rogovich
known
about
her
the
prince
had
known
something
something
which
had
given
him
power
over
her
at
a
glance
from
him
her
caprice
had
vanished
and
she
had
become
downcast
as
a
child
he
had
muttered
a
few
unintelligible
words
probably
in
polish
and
her
pride
had
crumbled
hindwood
was
at
a
loss
to
account
for
these
signs
of
a
secret
understanding
it
had
been
he
who
had
introduced
them
it
had
been
santa
who
had
confessed
to
curiosity
about
the
prince
and
had
begged
for
the
introduction
the
moment
he
had
made
them
acquainted
they
had
seemed
to
become
delighted
with
each
other
company
so
delighted
that
there
had
been
times
when
he
himself
had
felt
excluded
a
rivalry
for
santa
favors
had
sprung
up
between
the
prince
and
himself
this
atmosphere
of
jealousy
had
been
accentuated
by
the
behavior
of
the
wolfhound
santa
mere
approach
had
been
sufficient
to
rouse
him
into
fury
he
had
become
so
dangerous
that
he
had
had
to
be
sent
below
whenever
she
was
present
and
yet
despite
her
manifest
efforts
to
hold
the
prince
enchanted
behind
his
back
she
had
expressed
the
most
vigorous
aversion
she
had
spoken
of
his
reputation
for
treachery
and
the
whispers
that
went
the
rounds
of
his
heartlessness
toward
women
during
the
final
days
of
the
voyage
she
had
partly
atoned
for
this
inconsistency
by
appealing
to
hindwood
to
protect
her
against
the
prince
far
too
pressing
attention
she
had
declared
herself
to
be
in
some
kind
of
danger
though
what
kind
whether
moral
or
physical
she
had
left
him
to
conjecture
she
had
rather
flattered
him
by
her
appeal
nevertheless
he
had
been
considerably
surprised
to
observe
how
little
interest
she
had
still
displayed
in
protecting
herself
during
the
whole
of
that
last
day
while
they
had
been
approaching
the
white
line
of
cornish
coast
she
had
scarcely
devoted
to
him
a
glance
or
a
word
every
minute
she
had
spent
with
his
highness
whom
she
professed
to
regard
with
so
much
terror
she
had
created
the
impression
of
employing
every
trick
at
her
disposal
in
a
frantic
attempt
to
secure
him
as
her
conquest
if
as
many
of
the
passengers
had
asserted
the
presence
of
santa
gorlof
and
the
prince
on
the
same
boat
had
been
no
accident
then
what
had
been
the
object
of
their
elaborately
planned
deception
were
they
lovers
who
had
chosen
this
secret
method
of
traveling
in
order
to
avoid
a
scandal
or
was
she
one
of
the
many
women
whom
he
was
reported
to
have
abandoned
who
had
seized
the
leisure
of
an
atlantic
voyage
as
an
opportunity
for
reinstating
herself
in
his
affection
as
hindwood
listened
in
the
darkness
to
the
prince
name
being
shouted
and
waited
for
the
tug
to
cast
off
the
surmise
strengthened
into
certainty
that
he
had
been
the
dupe
of
a
piece
of
the
purpose
of
which
he
could
not
fathom
iii
philip
he
had
been
so
absorbed
in
his
thoughts
that
he
had
not
noticed
how
she
had
stolen
up
behind
him
without
removing
his
arms
from
the
rail
he
turned
slowly
and
surveyed
her
an
enviable
woman
and
her
age
perhaps
thirty
she
was
probably
a
slav
either
russian
or
polish
her
face
was
smooth
as
marble
high
cheekboned
and
golden
in
complexion
her
eyes
were
and
of
the
palest
gray
her
lips
were
passionate
and
always
a
little
parted
revealing
a
line
of
perfect
whiteness
like
a
streak
of
snow
between
the
curling
edges
of
two
but
it
was
her
hair
that
was
her
glory
abundant
as
night
as
steel
and
polished
as
metal
she
wore
it
simply
gathered
back
from
her
forehead
and
caught
in
a
loose
knot
low
against
her
neck
there
was
an
air
of
indefinable
aristocracy
about
her
perhaps
it
was
the
slightness
of
her
figure
and
the
alert
composure
of
her
carriage
and
then
there
was
a
touch
of
the
exotic
wistfully
sad
yet
exceedingly
mocking
like
so
many
slavs
behind
the
european
there
lurked
a
hint
of
the
asiatic
if
her
eyes
had
been
darker
she
might
easily
have
passed
for
a
hindoo
princess
her
fascination
quite
apart
from
her
beauty
lay
in
the
fact
that
she
was
so
ravishingly
feminine
to
be
a
woman
was
her
proud
profession
and
in
this
again
she
was
asiatic
what
hours
she
must
have
spent
over
pampering
her
body
she
was
sleek
and
groomed
as
a
physically
she
was
the
last
word
in
feminine
perfection
her
string
of
pearls
was
worth
more
than
most
men
earn
in
a
lifetime
her
sables
represented
the
year
income
of
a
millionaire
there
was
no
item
of
her
attire
that
was
not
sumptuous
and
that
had
not
been
acquired
regardless
of
expense
to
have
achieved
her
luxuriance
of
beauty
must
have
dissipated
a
fortune
whose
fortune
surely
not
hers
his
mind
was
haunted
by
misgivings
as
he
watched
her
he
had
so
nearly
allowed
himself
to
care
for
her
it
was
only
her
lightness
and
willful
inconsiderateness
that
had
prevented
but
now
that
he
had
been
prevented
her
employment
of
his
christian
name
struck
him
as
singularly
inappropriate
it
made
him
suspect
a
trap
it
put
him
in
a
mood
to
interpret
any
tenderness
on
her
part
as
strategy
as
a
signal
that
something
was
wanted
while
he
eyed
her
in
silence
she
drew
nearer
and
leaned
across
the
rail
her
shoulder
pressed
him
he
was
aware
of
the
tingling
sensation
of
her
warmth
like
a
little
hand
caressing
he
caught
her
fragrance
secret
and
somnolent
as
the
magic
of
hidden
in
damascus
she
spoke
her
voice
was
deep
and
foreign
it
seemed
too
deep
to
be
pent
in
so
slight
a
body
it
was
harsh
in
many
of
its
tones
as
though
there
had
been
times
when
it
had
been
parched
with
thirst
it
conjured
visions
of
caravans
creeping
across
molten
deserts
it
was
hypnotic
barbaric
in
listening
to
it
he
lost
sight
of
the
exquisite
sophistication
of
her
appearance
his
imagination
reclothed
her
loosening
her
hair
veiling
her
face
shrouding
her
in
a
robe
of
gold
and
saffron
slipping
sandals
on
her
feet
and
making
her
ankles
tinkle
with
many
bangles
do
like
me
any
more
is
it
not
so
she
questioned
softly
master
is
he
shook
himself
irritably
as
though
he
were
flinging
off
the
yoke
of
her
attraction
not
offended
i
was
what
why
should
my
master
be
thinking
of
prince
rogovich
he
leaned
still
further
across
the
rail
in
an
instinctive
effort
to
avoid
her
there
was
seduction
in
the
feigned
humility
with
which
she
addressed
him
as
though
he
were
a
pasha
and
she
a
he
said
would
be
indecent
for
me
to
be
thinking
of
anything
else
he
may
be
dead
there
no
knowing
this
time
last
night
i
could
walk
and
talk
and
laugh
with
him
he
was
full
of
plans
he
was
something
real
that
i
could
touch
he
has
she
repeated
the
word
with
a
sigh
which
was
almost
of
contentment
was
wondering
he
continued
and
then
halted
were
wondering
she
prompted
drawing
himself
erect
he
faced
her
her
bantering
tone
had
roused
his
indignation
yet
even
in
his
revulsion
he
thrilled
to
the
sweetness
of
her
luring
eyes
glinting
at
him
palely
through
the
shadows
was
more
your
friend
much
more
your
friend
than
mine
he
reproached
her
probably
been
a
tragedy
yet
you
do
seem
to
care
one
might
even
believe
you
were
glad
not
she
spoke
smilingly
averting
her
eyes
as
for
caring
why
should
i
he
laughed
quietly
why
should
you
why
should
you
care
what
happens
to
any
man
i
hated
him
she
protested
had
given
me
cause
to
hate
had
a
strange
way
of
showing
it
you
made
yourself
most
amazingly
charming
he
could
never
have
guessed
no
one
could
ever
have
guessed
who
watched
you
with
him
that
you
no
only
you
and
i
we
knew
it
was
our
business
to
let
everybody
suddenly
she
seemed
to
divine
what
was
troubling
him
darting
out
her
hand
she
seized
his
wrist
in
a
grip
of
steel
that
such
strength
lay
hidden
in
so
frail
a
hand
was
unexpected
her
attitude
instantly
changed
to
one
of
coaxing
jealous
do
be
jealous
it
had
to
be
and
it
ended
in
a
sense
it
was
for
your
sake
that
it
had
to
leisurely
he
freed
himself
bending
back
her
fingers
and
taking
pleasure
in
demonstrating
that
his
strength
was
the
greater
no
idea
what
you
talking
about
he
said
coldly
feelings
toward
prince
rogovich
are
none
of
my
concern
if
by
the
thing
that
had
to
happen
you
refer
to
the
shameless
way
in
which
you
made
love
to
him
i
can
not
conceive
any
possible
set
of
circumstances
that
would
make
it
necessary
for
you
to
make
love
for
my
sake
to
another
he
had
turned
and
was
sauntering
away
from
her
she
went
after
him
breathlessly
arresting
him
once
more
with
the
secret
strength
of
her
slim
gloved
hand
make
love
to
him
i
did
mean
what
it
was
that
she
had
meant
she
had
no
time
to
tell
the
siren
of
the
burst
into
an
earsplitting
blast
impatient
repeated
and
agonizing
at
the
signal
gangplanks
were
withdrawn
from
the
tug
and
run
back
into
dark
holes
in
the
side
of
the
liner
ropes
were
cast
off
and
coiled
engines
began
to
quicken
and
screws
to
churn
the
narrow
channel
which
had
separated
the
two
vessels
commenced
to
widen
on
the
the
band
struck
up
above
its
lively
clamor
the
sound
of
prince
rogovich
name
being
shouted
could
still
be
heard
as
hindwood
stared
up
at
the
floating
mammoth
scanning
the
tiers
of
faces
gaping
down
even
at
tills
last
moment
he
half
expected
to
see
the
prince
come
rushing
out
instead
a
sight
much
stranger
met
his
eyes
the
tug
was
backing
away
to
get
sufficient
clearance
to
turn
in
the
direction
of
land
she
had
not
quite
cleared
herself
when
signs
of
frenzied
disturbance
were
noticeable
on
the
promenade
deck
the
musicians
were
dropping
their
instruments
and
fleeing
passengers
were
glancing
across
their
shoulders
and
scattering
in
all
directions
in
the
vacant
space
which
their
stampede
had
created
the
infuriated
head
of
the
prince
wolfhound
reared
itself
for
a
couple
of
seconds
he
hung
there
poised
glaring
down
then
suddenly
he
seemed
to
descry
the
object
he
was
searching
steadying
himself
he
shot
straight
out
into
the
gulf
of
blackness
in
a
white
streak
like
the
finger
of
conscience
pointing
he
fell
just
missing
the
deck
of
the
tug
where
hindwood
and
his
companion
were
standing
he
must
have
struck
the
side
for
as
he
reached
the
water
he
sank
it
was
over
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
but
it
had
seemed
to
hindwood
that
as
the
hound
had
leaped
his
burning
gaze
had
been
fixed
on
santa
gorlof
iv
she
made
no
sound
while
the
danger
lasted
but
the
moment
the
hurtling
white
body
had
fallen
short
she
rushed
to
the
side
peering
down
into
the
yeasty
scum
of
blackness
she
was
speaking
rapidly
in
a
foreign
language
laughing
softly
with
malicious
triumph
and
shaking
a
small
clenched
fist
at
the
night
it
was
thus
that
a
woman
at
jezreel
must
have
looked
when
she
painted
her
face
and
tired
her
hair
and
leaned
out
of
her
palace
window
jeering
at
the
charioteer
who
had
been
sent
to
slay
her
the
passionate
eloquence
of
santa
gestures
thrilled
as
much
as
it
shocked
hindwood
it
made
her
appearance
of
lavish
modernity
seem
a
disguise
and
yet
he
admired
her
more
than
ever
it
was
her
courage
he
admired
putting
his
arm
about
her
roughly
he
said
coming
she
darted
back
her
head
in
defiance
like
a
serpent
about
to
strike
then
recognition
of
him
dawned
in
her
eyes
she
ceased
to
struggle
and
relaxed
against
his
breast
it
was
only
for
a
second
slipping
her
arm
submissively
into
his
well
if
you
say
so
she
whispered
guiding
her
steps
across
the
slippery
deck
he
pushed
open
the
door
of
a
little
saloon
and
entered
the
atmosphere
was
blue
with
wreaths
of
smoke
and
heavy
with
the
smell
of
tobacco
at
a
table
in
the
center
beneath
a
swinging
lamp
the
immigration
officers
were
dealing
cards
and
settling
their
debts
with
pennies
they
were
too
absorbed
in
their
petty
gambling
to
notice
what
was
going
on
about
them
in
a
corner
outside
the
circle
of
light
he
found
a
trunk
and
ordered
her
to
sit
down
the
meekness
with
which
she
complied
flattered
his
sense
of
her
dependence
he
might
really
have
been
a
pasha
and
she
his
he
did
not
understand
her
she
cozened
and
baffled
him
people
and
things
which
he
did
not
understand
were
apt
to
rouse
his
resentment
especially
when
they
were
women
his
distrust
of
the
sex
was
inherent
but
as
he
watched
this
woman
drooping
in
the
shadows
his
pity
came
uppermost
she
was
so
alone
so
unprotected
the
hour
was
late
long
past
midnight
her
storm
of
emotion
had
exhausted
her
it
was
absurd
that
he
should
have
allowed
himself
to
become
so
jealous
he
could
never
have
made
her
his
wife
the
chances
were
she
would
not
have
accepted
him
she
belonged
to
a
more
modish
world
and
if
she
had
she
would
have
driven
him
from
his
course
with
her
whims
and
tempests
she
would
have
wrecked
his
career
with
her
greed
for
wealthy
trappings
he
and
she
were
utterly
different
they
had
nothing
in
common
but
their
physical
attraction
he
was
seeing
things
clearly
with
each
fresh
whiff
of
land
affairs
were
regrouping
themselves
in
their
true
perspective
he
had
been
the
shuttlecock
of
a
shipboard
flirtation
he
had
magnified
infatuation
into
a
grand
passion
on
many
a
previous
voyage
he
had
been
the
amused
spectator
of
just
such
profitless
expenditures
of
sentiment
and
here
he
was
a
victim
of
the
same
foolishness
the
futility
of
the
ending
was
the
adventure
condemnation
probably
she
was
indulging
in
similar
reflections
within
an
hour
of
stepping
ashore
they
would
have
lost
sight
of
each
other
forever
after
so
much
intimacy
and
misplaced
emotion
they
would
walk
out
of
each
other
life
without
regret
partly
out
of
curiosity
but
more
out
of
courtesy
he
seated
himself
beside
her
for
what
he
intended
should
be
their
last
conversation
happens
next
she
clutched
her
furs
more
closely
about
her
do
you
must
know
he
persisted
i
meant
was
where
is
your
destination
then
she
added
wearily
could
have
discovered
by
examining
my
her
fatigue
made
him
the
more
determined
to
be
helpful
did
ask
out
of
impertinence
but
because
i
thought
it
would
be
london
probably
there
be
no
train
to
london
if
the
prince
had
been
with
us
they
have
put
on
a
special
but
you
and
i
are
the
only
passengers
and
neither
of
us
is
sufficiently
important
besides
after
this
delay
it
be
nearly
daylight
before
we
clear
the
i
have
to
sleep
in
you
be
met
by
friends
he
had
no
sooner
hazarded
the
suggestion
than
an
obvious
conjecture
flashed
through
his
mind
the
marvel
was
that
it
had
not
flashed
earlier
might
be
if
the
conjecture
proved
correct
it
would
put
the
final
punishing
touch
of
satire
to
this
romance
sweeping
him
with
her
pale
derisive
eyes
she
murmured
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
i
shall
be
met
by
no
after
that
there
was
silence
a
silence
interrupted
at
intervals
by
the
exclamations
of
the
players
as
they
thumped
down
their
cards
and
raked
in
their
pennies
for
relief
he
reverted
to
the
subject
uppermost
in
both
their
minds
wonder
what
became
of
her
tone
betrayed
no
interest
been
trying
to
think
back
he
said
to
remember
when
last
i
saw
believe
i
last
saw
him
alive
just
after
she
spun
round
as
though
jerked
on
wires
who
suggests
that
he
is
alive
one
i
the
first
but
if
he
is
found
by
the
suggestion
will
be
on
the
lips
of
all
the
doubt
do
hindwood
smiled
of
the
prince
eminence
are
not
allowed
to
vanish
without
a
stir
i
only
hoping
that
you
and
i
are
not
involved
in
it
we
were
the
only
people
with
whom
he
associated
on
the
voyage
we
likely
to
be
detained
and
certain
to
be
questioned
for
all
we
know
the
air
full
of
marconi
messages
about
us
at
this
her
face
had
gone
white
us
what
had
we
to
do
with
it
but
when
a
tragedy
of
this
sort
occurs
we
all
liable
to
be
she
gazed
at
him
intently
you
think
there
was
a
tragedy
feel
sure
of
it
it
my
belief
that
he
either
fell
or
was
pushed
overboard
somewhere
out
there
in
the
darkness
he
bobbing
up
and
down
it
almost
as
though
i
could
see
him
i
could
feel
more
sure
if
she
shuddered
and
pressed
against
him
trying
to
frighten
me
i
wo
be
frightened
it
all
nonsense
what
you
saying
why
should
any
one
want
to
push
him
over
sorry
he
apologized
did
mean
to
frighten
you
perhaps
we
wasting
our
breath
and
already
he
been
but
why
should
any
one
want
to
push
him
over
she
urged
ca
answer
that
but
he
was
liked
one
could
be
fascinated
by
his
personality
but
one
could
like
him
take
yourself
were
you
telling
me
a
few
minutes
ago
how
intensely
you
hated
him
she
nodded
was
the
sort
of
man
every
woman
had
the
right
to
after
a
pause
she
faced
him
completely
mistress
of
herself
did
you
last
see
him
not
hindwood
hesitated
far
as
i
remember
it
was
after
dinner
in
the
lounge
he
was
giving
some
instructions
about
his
baggage
when
did
you
dinner
in
the
her
eyes
met
his
and
flickered
must
have
been
shortly
after
eight
for
i
spent
till
ten
in
my
stateroom
finishing
my
before
she
had
made
an
end
he
knew
that
she
had
lied
several
times
after
dinner
he
had
walked
past
her
stateroom
hoping
for
a
last
encounter
her
trunks
and
cases
had
been
piled
in
the
passage
already
locked
and
strapped
he
had
tried
to
discover
from
the
stewardess
her
whereabouts
and
had
been
told
that
since
dining
she
had
not
returned
he
had
gone
on
deck
in
search
of
her
hunting
everywhere
it
must
have
been
shortly
after
ten
that
he
had
come
across
two
shadowy
figures
in
the
bows
they
were
whispering
together
they
might
have
been
embracing
the
man
figure
had
been
too
dim
for
him
to
identify
but
he
could
have
sworn
that
the
woman
was
hers
he
had
reached
this
point
in
his
piecing
together
of
evidence
when
he
noticed
that
the
were
pushing
back
their
chairs
santa
touched
his
arm
gently
think
we
the
next
moment
the
soft
bump
of
the
tug
against
the
piles
confirmed
the
news
of
their
arrival
v
it
began
to
look
as
if
all
hope
of
rest
would
have
to
be
abandoned
at
the
moment
of
landing
the
dock
had
been
almost
festive
there
had
been
a
group
of
railway
officials
mildly
beaming
and
fussily
important
who
had
approached
hindwood
as
he
stepped
ashore
with
rogovich
if
we
are
not
mistaken
there
had
been
another
group
of
newspaper
reporters
who
having
addressed
him
as
highness
and
having
discovered
their
error
had
promptly
turned
their
backs
on
him
there
had
been
a
major
in
uniform
with
a
monocle
in
his
eye
who
had
pranced
up
tearing
off
a
salute
and
announcing
detailed
by
the
foreign
office
your
when
they
had
learned
that
the
prince
had
unaccountably
avoided
plymouth
their
atmosphere
of
geniality
faded
the
special
train
which
was
to
have
borne
him
swiftly
to
london
was
promptly
canceled
within
ten
minutes
muttering
with
disgust
all
the
world
except
two
porters
had
dribbled
off
into
the
night
in
the
where
pending
the
inspection
of
the
customs
officers
hindwood
and
santa
were
ordered
to
remain
their
reception
was
no
more
enlivening
at
first
when
they
had
entered
a
had
been
spread
gleaming
with
warmth
and
light
before
mirrors
girl
attendants
had
been
reviewing
their
appearance
with
smiles
of
brightest
expectation
their
expectancy
had
been
quickly
dulled
by
the
news
of
the
prince
they
had
scarcely
spared
time
to
supply
the
wants
of
the
two
travelers
before
they
had
started
to
close
up
the
ticket
clerk
had
copied
the
girls
example
as
he
had
pulled
down
the
shutter
of
his
office
he
had
briefly
stated
train
till
the
in
the
after
that
they
had
been
left
he
and
this
strange
woman
in
the
drafty
gloom
of
the
dockstation
the
two
porters
had
huddled
down
and
snored
among
the
baggage
santa
closing
her
eyes
had
appeared
to
join
them
in
their
slumbers
at
last
a
solitary
customs
officer
had
arrived
he
volunteered
no
explanation
for
his
delay
he
was
evidently
newly
risen
half
awake
and
in
a
mood
of
suppressed
irritation
his
examination
was
perfunctory
having
completed
his
barest
duty
he
likewise
made
his
exit
it
was
then
when
all
their
troubles
seemed
ended
that
the
porters
had
informed
them
that
it
was
necessary
for
passengers
to
see
their
luggage
weighed
and
personally
to
supervise
its
being
loaded
in
the
van
for
london
hindwood
turned
to
his
companion
tired
you
better
be
off
to
bed
i
see
this
through
for
half
an
hour
later
when
he
had
complied
with
all
formalities
and
was
free
to
seek
a
bed
himself
he
remembered
that
he
had
inquired
where
she
would
be
staying
and
that
he
did
know
the
name
of
a
hotel
wondering
where
he
should
sleep
and
how
he
could
reach
her
with
the
receipts
for
her
trunks
he
wandered
out
into
the
yard
of
the
station
the
first
grayness
of
dawn
was
spreading
a
chill
was
in
the
air
behind
the
sepulchers
of
muted
houses
a
cock
was
crowing
he
gazed
up
and
down
near
the
gate
a
cab
was
standing
its
lamp
burned
dimly
on
the
point
of
flickering
out
the
driver
sat
hunched
on
the
box
the
horse
hung
dejectedly
between
the
shafts
they
both
slumbered
immovably
crossing
the
yard
he
shook
the
man
arm
wake
up
i
want
you
to
drive
me
to
a
good
the
man
came
to
with
a
jerk
good
that
wot
the
lady
wanted
you
must
be
the
i
wuz
told
to
wait
hindwood
nodded
you
driven
the
lady
already
then
you
better
take
me
to
wherever
you
took
he
had
opened
the
door
and
was
in
the
act
of
entering
when
the
horse
started
forward
making
him
lose
his
balance
as
he
stretched
out
his
hands
to
steady
himself
what
was
his
surprise
to
discover
that
the
cab
was
already
tenanted
vi
i
beg
your
there
was
no
reply
to
his
apology
he
repeated
it
in
a
tone
of
more
elaborate
courtesy
your
when
he
was
again
greeted
with
silence
he
added
thought
it
was
empty
i
did
do
it
on
purpose
i
hope
you
not
in
the
mildewed
square
of
blackness
rank
with
the
smell
of
stables
he
held
his
breath
trying
to
detect
whether
sleep
would
account
for
the
taciturnity
of
the
other
occupant
he
could
detect
nothing
all
lesser
sounds
were
drowned
in
the
rattle
of
their
progress
groping
he
felt
a
woman
dress
hollowing
his
hand
to
shade
the
flame
he
struck
a
match
for
a
brief
moment
his
eyes
met
hers
opened
wide
and
gazing
at
him
instantly
she
leaned
forward
pursing
her
lips
the
flame
went
out
the
meaning
of
this
he
had
been
startled
and
spoke
with
sharpness
was
only
one
cab
so
i
she
yawned
luxuriously
i
waited
i
did
want
to
lose
it
was
his
turn
to
be
silent
after
a
pause
while
she
gave
him
a
chance
to
reply
she
continued
have
been
stranded
if
i
taken
the
only
cab
and
then
i
did
want
to
lose
you
not
that
losing
me
would
have
meant
anything
to
you
not
now
it
would
would
it
there
was
no
escape
however
she
chose
to
accuse
him
he
would
be
forced
to
listen
but
it
could
be
far
to
the
hotel
speaking
reasonably
he
attempted
to
appease
her
given
you
no
occasion
for
supposing
she
laughed
softly
you
think
so
on
the
boat
you
were
burning
up
for
me
you
were
molten
incandescent
now
you
dark
and
dank
through
with
she
caught
her
breath
though
he
could
not
see
her
he
knew
that
her
small
clenched
fists
were
pressed
against
her
mouth
again
she
was
speaking
is
it
if
you
only
give
me
a
reason
while
i
been
sitting
here
alone
i
kept
asking
myself
is
it
am
i
less
beautiful
less
kind
less
good
does
he
think
that
he
discovered
something
evil
about
me
what
have
i
done
that
he
should
have
changed
so
suddenly
with
a
cry
of
pain
she
turned
have
i
done
it
just
that
you
should
tell
me
if
you
take
me
back
i
be
anything
for
you
try
so
hard
to
be
more
could
be
more
it
was
said
without
enthusiasm
the
suspicion
still
possessed
him
that
she
was
last
evening
she
had
practiced
these
same
wiles
on
the
man
who
had
vanished
did
she
intend
that
he
should
vanish
too
it
was
horrible
that
he
should
ask
himself
such
a
question
and
yet
he
could
not
rid
his
imagination
of
the
hound
plunging
to
death
and
pointing
at
her
like
the
finger
of
conscience
the
happenings
of
that
night
had
been
sufficiently
dramatic
so
why
this
second
rehearsal
he
was
too
humble
in
his
to
believe
that
his
own
attractions
could
account
for
such
a
storm
of
passion
you
he
spoke
cautiously
never
belonged
to
me
until
now
you
given
no
hint
that
you
wanted
to
belong
to
me
on
the
contrary
you
trifled
with
me
and
shown
a
distinct
preference
for
another
man
it
preposterous
for
you
to
talk
about
my
taking
you
back
when
i
never
had
you
we
been
companions
for
a
handful
of
hours
we
liked
being
together
at
least
i
have
but
to
create
such
a
scene
is
absurd
nothing
warrants
it
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
our
liking
might
strengthen
into
love
there
no
telling
but
end
right
here
and
now
if
you
force
matters
what
know
about
me
about
you
i
know
even
less
if
any
one
were
to
ask
me
i
could
tell
him
whether
you
were
a
pole
or
a
persian
or
whether
you
were
single
divorced
or
married
i
have
the
least
idea
of
your
social
standing
or
why
while
appearing
so
prosperous
you
travel
without
a
maid
and
by
yourself
for
all
i
know
man
needs
to
know
nothing
about
a
woman
she
interrupted
that
he
loves
her
she
might
be
a
thousand
things
if
he
loved
her
none
of
them
would
count
if
she
were
bad
he
would
hope
to
make
her
good
with
his
own
goodness
men
always
expect
women
to
do
that
why
a
woman
expect
it
of
a
man
if
you
loved
me
and
you
did
love
me
no
matter
how
wicked
you
thought
me
even
though
you
believed
i
killed
some
one
you
would
care
you
find
some
splendid
motive
and
persuade
yourself
that
i
done
it
for
the
she
broke
off
then
she
added
course
i
killed
it
was
an
extraordinary
disclaimer
as
though
it
were
always
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
nice
conventional
women
might
have
killed
somebody
she
had
said
it
as
casually
as
another
woman
might
have
said
do
powder
or
do
he
scarcely
know
whether
to
be
shocked
or
amused
he
was
loath
to
take
her
seriously
behind
the
thinning
darkness
he
was
trying
to
discover
her
expression
when
his
calmness
was
swept
away
by
a
new
disturbance
she
had
slipped
to
her
knees
in
the
narrow
space
by
the
dim
light
that
streaked
the
panes
he
could
just
make
out
her
figure
bowed
against
him
the
next
moment
her
tears
were
falling
and
she
was
kissing
his
hands
must
he
tried
to
withdraw
his
hands
she
clung
to
them
failing
in
that
he
attempted
to
raise
her
face
she
kept
it
obstinately
averted
the
bumping
of
the
cab
on
the
uneven
paving
jostled
her
against
him
he
feared
lest
inadvertently
he
might
bruise
her
the
situation
was
grotesque
it
stirred
both
his
pity
and
his
anger
if
this
were
then
it
was
laughter
and
not
sobbing
that
was
shaking
her
but
if
her
grief
were
real
at
that
thought
the
shy
lonely
tenderness
of
the
man
overwhelmed
him
here
at
last
was
a
who
needed
his
affection
she
was
so
fragile
so
capricious
so
rapturous
santa
i
did
mean
somehow
i
hurt
she
did
speak
but
she
stayed
her
sobbing
me
see
your
he
stooped
lower
the
scent
of
her
hair
was
in
his
nostrils
his
reluctant
arms
went
about
her
their
embrace
strengthened
with
a
moan
she
lifted
up
her
face
white
and
ghostly
as
the
dawn
that
was
all
about
them
in
a
frenzy
of
silent
longing
their
lips
met
vii
with
a
jerk
the
cab
drew
up
against
the
pavement
tossing
the
reins
on
the
horse
back
the
driver
was
lumbering
down
that
santa
might
have
time
to
compose
herself
hindwood
leaned
quickly
out
slamming
the
door
behind
him
you
brought
us
a
good
the
man
grumbled
on
the
defensive
staring
at
the
gray
cliff
of
shrouded
windows
was
a
good
you
wanted
and
then
it
the
london
station
where
the
train
starts
in
the
marnin
it
give
the
missis
ten
minutes
extry
in
missis
hindwood
frowned
you
refer
to
the
lady
who
with
me
she
not
my
the
man
became
sly
stretching
a
fat
finger
along
his
nose
he
edged
nearer
and
whispered
you
and
me
that
wot
wiv
drivin
so
many
gentry
from
the
contingnong
me
own
morals
are
almost
hindwood
turned
from
him
coldly
on
the
wrong
tack
and
now
how
does
one
get
into
this
hotel
will
they
admit
us
at
such
an
hour
hours
that
the
case
he
thrust
his
head
inside
the
cab
stay
here
santa
i
go
and
find
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
back
take
us
go
inside
and
wait
while
i
settle
with
the
when
he
joined
her
at
the
desk
he
found
it
necessary
to
make
the
same
explanation
that
he
had
already
made
to
the
cabman
the
had
allotted
them
one
room
taking
it
for
granted
they
were
married
he
had
to
be
informed
that
two
were
required
want
on
the
same
floor
and
next
to
each
other
the
roof
if
you
like
hindwood
answered
impatiently
let
us
get
to
bed
we
or
rather
catching
the
train
to
london
in
the
morning
and
it
nearly
daylight
now
how
about
you
he
turned
to
santa
train
are
you
catching
same
as
we
might
as
well
breakfast
together
she
nodded
turning
again
to
the
he
said
us
both
down
for
a
call
at
the
man
was
leading
the
way
upstairs
as
they
followed
santa
whispered
see
you
were
threatened
that
we
be
detained
and
questioned
you
frightened
me
terribly
we
we
she
slipped
her
arm
through
his
companionably
feel
so
relieved
and
happy
i
do
believe
there
was
a
tragedy
the
prince
changed
his
mind
at
the
last
moment
he
landing
at
boulogne
or
rotterdam
it
may
even
have
been
a
strategy
to
mislead
some
enemy
who
was
waiting
for
him
here
in
i
never
thought
of
their
rooms
were
on
different
floors
the
porter
showed
the
way
to
hers
first
now
that
they
had
to
separate
hindwood
would
have
given
much
for
a
private
word
with
her
discreetly
outside
her
door
in
the
presence
of
the
they
parted
we
meet
at
breakfast
he
reminded
her
breakfast
she
assented
let
hope
that
we
do
oversleep
viii
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
head
had
just
touched
the
pillow
when
he
was
awakened
by
his
door
being
pounded
sitting
up
in
bed
he
consulted
his
watch
seven
exactly
awake
he
shouted
with
that
he
jumped
out
of
bod
to
prevent
himself
from
drowsing
his
first
thought
was
of
her
again
he
was
going
to
meet
her
the
prospect
filled
him
with
excitement
but
not
with
gladness
his
dreams
had
been
troubled
by
her
there
had
been
no
moment
since
he
had
closed
his
eyes
that
he
had
been
without
her
the
wildness
of
that
kiss
bestowed
in
the
dark
by
a
woman
humbling
herself
had
set
his
blood
on
fire
it
was
not
right
that
a
man
should
be
kissed
like
that
and
yet
he
longed
to
reexperience
the
sensation
woman
could
have
done
it
he
argued
is
love
nothing
peculiar
to
santa
any
reasonably
beautiful
woman
could
have
done
it
by
acting
the
way
she
acted
i
had
consoled
myself
that
i
was
immune
from
women
i
was
starving
and
i
did
know
his
sane
mind
warned
him
that
it
would
be
wise
to
avoid
further
encounters
she
was
too
alluring
for
him
to
withstand
there
were
too
many
things
about
her
that
were
unaccountable
there
was
her
frenzied
display
of
infatuation
for
both
himself
and
the
prince
all
within
the
space
of
twelve
hours
he
was
brushing
his
hair
and
viewing
his
reflection
in
the
shabby
mirror
when
he
reached
this
point
he
stopped
brushing
and
regarded
his
reflection
intently
what
could
any
woman
discover
in
those
features
to
go
mad
over
it
was
a
hard
face
cleanshaven
bony
and
powerful
roughened
by
the
wind
and
tanned
by
the
sun
it
was
the
mask
of
an
ascetic
which
concealed
rather
than
revealed
the
emotions
and
yet
once
it
had
been
sensitive
you
could
trace
that
in
the
kindly
blueness
of
the
eyes
and
the
faint
tenderness
of
the
mouth
the
hair
was
a
rusty
brown
growing
thin
about
the
temples
the
nose
was
pinched
at
the
nostrils
with
suffering
the
brow
furrowed
he
smiled
in
amused
disapproval
and
went
on
with
his
brushing
not
the
face
of
an
apollo
nothing
to
rave
about
and
yet
despite
his
looks
here
was
at
least
one
woman
who
for
whatever
reason
was
desperate
to
marry
him
on
the
drive
through
the
dawn
from
the
dock
to
the
hotel
she
had
left
no
doubt
of
her
intentions
it
inflamed
his
curiosity
though
he
was
nearing
forty
with
the
exception
of
that
one
disastrous
affair
women
were
still
for
him
an
untried
adventure
but
in
the
case
of
santa
to
indulge
his
curiosity
further
might
lead
to
penalties
she
was
liable
to
repeat
last
performance
the
journey
to
london
would
probably
provide
her
with
a
fitting
opportunity
if
it
did
could
he
muster
the
cruelty
to
refuse
her
on
one
point
his
mind
was
made
up
he
would
not
marry
her
he
had
no
time
to
waste
on
marriage
with
her
it
would
be
folly
moreover
while
her
breaking
down
of
reticences
had
spurred
his
eagerness
it
had
forfeited
his
respect
it
had
robbed
him
of
his
prerogative
of
conquest
it
had
changed
him
from
the
hunter
into
the
hunted
he
was
all
but
trapped
he
was
fastening
his
bag
he
pressed
the
catch
into
the
lock
and
stood
up
not
yet
not
immediately
his
mind
began
to
race
devising
plans
for
eluding
capture
he
did
need
to
keep
his
breakfast
appointment
with
her
he
could
miss
the
and
travel
to
london
later
he
could
slip
out
unnoticed
and
take
up
his
abode
in
another
hotel
once
he
had
lost
her
he
would
have
put
himself
beyond
temptation
she
would
have
no
clew
to
his
whereabouts
nor
he
to
hers
as
he
passed
slowly
down
the
stairs
he
was
still
undecided
as
to
how
he
should
act
on
arriving
in
the
hall
he
loitered
by
the
hotel
desk
half
determined
to
call
for
his
reckoning
and
make
a
bolt
for
it
while
he
dallied
the
yearning
to
see
her
for
a
last
time
swam
uppermost
after
all
he
owed
something
to
the
only
woman
who
had
paid
him
the
compliment
of
loving
him
he
would
not
speak
to
her
would
not
let
her
know
that
he
was
there
he
would
peep
into
the
room
unseen
and
remember
her
always
as
waiting
for
him
bag
in
hand
he
strode
along
the
passage
to
the
where
breakfast
was
being
served
the
baize
doors
were
with
scurrying
waiters
stooping
he
peered
through
the
panes
pushing
the
doors
slightly
open
he
gazed
more
steadily
the
room
was
littered
with
ungroomed
people
their
heads
bowed
their
elbows
flapping
like
a
flock
of
city
sparrows
snatching
crumbs
from
beneath
the
hoofs
of
passing
traffic
nowhere
could
he
espy
her
his
rarer
bird
of
the
dainty
plumage
he
grew
ashamed
of
his
furtiveness
why
should
he
be
afraid
of
her
she
should
be
disappointed
she
should
find
him
gallantly
expecting
her
resigning
his
bag
to
a
solicitous
he
drew
himself
up
to
his
lean
western
height
and
entered
ix
seated
at
a
table
lie
had
watched
the
for
a
full
he
had
finished
his
breakfast
if
he
were
to
catch
the
it
was
time
for
him
to
be
moving
he
began
to
flirt
with
the
idea
of
postponing
his
journey
it
was
evident
she
had
overslept
herself
at
the
desk
while
he
settled
his
account
he
had
it
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
inquire
for
her
but
he
was
daunted
by
the
presence
of
the
the
man
kept
eyeing
him
with
a
knowing
grin
as
though
he
were
expecting
just
such
a
question
wo
gratify
him
hindwood
thought
fellow
knows
too
much
it
fate
if
i
miss
he
crossed
the
road
to
the
station
having
secured
a
seat
in
a
smoker
he
roamed
up
and
down
the
platform
every
few
minutes
he
consulted
his
watch
as
the
hands
circled
nearer
to
the
he
bought
papers
at
the
and
returned
to
buy
more
papers
from
there
while
not
seeming
to
do
so
he
could
obtain
a
clear
view
of
the
hotel
and
still
there
was
no
sign
of
her
when
it
was
almost
too
late
he
threw
caution
to
the
winds
at
a
gait
between
a
run
and
a
walk
he
recrossed
the
road
and
dashed
up
the
hotel
steps
as
he
confronted
the
clerk
behind
the
desk
he
was
a
little
breathless
he
was
also
aware
that
the
grin
had
widened
a
lady
staying
here
she
was
to
have
traveled
with
me
to
london
i
afraid
she
not
been
lady
the
clerk
looked
up
with
the
bored
expression
of
one
who
was
impervious
to
romance
lady
oh
a
passenger
from
the
he
continued
name
miss
gorlof
send
some
one
to
her
room
to
find
out
at
once
the
interrupted
addressing
the
clerk
he
said

lady

told
you
about
the
one

all
the
then

a
gentleman
in
goggles
who
could
speak
no
english
arrived
in
a
tourin
car
and
drove
off
with
off
with
her
but
realizing
that
too
much
emotion
would
make
him
appear
ridiculous
he
steadied
his
voice
and
asked
casually
suppose
she
left
a
note
for
me
the
clerk
glanced
across
his
shoulder
at
the
rack
name
hindwood
is
it
he
raised
his
hand
to
a
pigeonhole
lettered
can
see
for
yourself
sir
there
nothing
in
perhaps
it
was
a
verbal
message
she
would
be
certain
to
leave
me
her
the
clerk
turned
to
the
she
the
beamed
with
satisfaction
did
he
had
achieved
his
dramatic
effect
x
he
was
the
last
passenger
to
squeeze
through
the
barrier
as
he
scrambled
into
his
carriage
the
train
was
on
the
point
of
moving
spreading
one
of
his
many
papers
on
his
knees
he
lit
a
cigarette
he
believed
he
was
behaving
as
though
nothing
had
happened
i
can
take
it
like
this
proves
that
she
was
nothing
to
me
he
assured
himself
ten
minutes
later
he
discovered
that
he
had
not
read
a
line
and
that
the
cigarette
had
gone
out
suppose
i
a
bit
upset
he
admitted
goodness
knows
why
i
should
be
the
matter
ended
exactly
as
i
but
had
it
what
had
he
wanted
does
a
man
ever
know
what
he
wants
where
a
woman
is
concerned
he
desires
most
the
thing
which
he
most
dreads
during
the
voyage
he
had
wanted
to
win
her
from
prince
rogovich
on
the
tug
he
had
wanted
to
forget
her
in
the
cab
he
had
wanted
to
go
on
kissing
her
forever
that
morning
he
had
wanted
to
save
his
freedom
on
the
station
like
a
maddened
schoolboy
his
terror
had
been
lest
he
might
lose
her
as
a
result
he
had
lost
her
somewhere
through
the
sunny
lanes
of
devon
she
was
speeding
with
the
gentleman
who
speak
no
and
wore
goggles
in
which
direction
and
for
what
purpose
he
could
not
guess
he
smiled
bitterly
it
was
a
situation
which
called
for
mirth
he
had
accused
her
of
having
trapped
him
at
a
time
when
she
herself
had
been
escaping
from
him
he
had
complained
that
her
affection
was
too
ardently
obvious
at
a
moment
when
she
was
proving
herself
most
coldly
elusive
while
he
had
been
resenting
the
way
in
which
he
was
being
hunted
she
had
already
abandoned
him
to
hunt
to
his
heart
content
his
reflections
were
broken
in
upon
by
a
weakeyed
old
clergyman
seated
opposite
to
him
in
the
far
corner
me
but
i
see
by
your
labels
that
you
just
landed
may
i
ask
whether
your
vessel
was
the
there
an
item
in
the
local
paper
which
should
interest
you
it
has
to
do
with
prince
rogovich
the
great
polish
patriot
he
was
your
fellow
passenger
if
i
not
hindwood
was
disinclined
for
conversation
he
made
his
tone
brusk
that
he
might
discourage
further
questions
not
mistaken
and
i
guess
i
know
what
you
going
to
tell
me
that
after
all
the
preparations
made
for
his
reception
the
prince
did
land
at
plymouth
but
without
notifying
any
one
traveled
on
either
to
boulogne
or
that
was
what
i
was
going
to
tell
you
the
old
gentleman
continued
in
his
benevolent
pulpit
manner
no
i
was
going
to
tell
you
something
quite
different
after
the
left
plymouth
the
captain
had
her
searched
from
stem
to
stern
not
a
trace
of
the
prince
could
be
i
suppose
the
news
was
received
by
wireless
does
the
paper
suggest
an
explanation
whatsoever
i
thought
you
be
interested
perhaps
you
like
to
read
for
the
paper
contained
the
bare
fact
as
the
clergyman
had
stated
it
complete
search
was
made
all
his
personal
belongings
were
found
intact
but
of
the
prince
himself
not
a
hindwood
closed
his
eyes
and
pretended
to
sleep
that
he
might
protect
himself
from
further
intrusions
he
wanted
to
argue
his
way
through
this
problem
and
to
acquit
santa
of
any
share
in
what
had
happened
and
yet
if
an
investigation
were
held
and
he
himself
had
to
tell
all
he
knew
things
would
look
black
for
her
was
that
why
he
tried
to
crush
the
ugly
thought
but
it
clamored
to
be
expressed
was
that
why
she
had
made
love
to
him
that
her
kiss
might
seal
his
lips
with
silence
the
train
was
slowing
down
he
opened
his
eyes
in
the
cheerfulness
of
sunshine
life
took
on
a
more
normal
aspect
towering
above
crowded
roofs
of
houses
a
tall
cathedral
pricked
the
blueness
of
the
sky
are
we
the
clergyman
was
collecting
his
bundles
where
i
as
soon
as
he
had
the
carriage
to
himself
before
any
one
could
enter
he
reached
up
to
the
rack
and
quickly
removed
the
labels
from
his
bag
having
done
that
he
stepped
to
the
platform
and
went
in
search
of
papers
the
torn
labels
were
still
in
his
hand
surreptitiously
he
dropped
them
between
the
train
and
the
platform
some
distance
lower
down
than
his
own
carriage
he
realized
the
stealth
he
had
employed
only
when
exeter
was
left
behind
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
getting
on
my
in
his
most
recently
acquired
batch
of
papers
he
found
no
reference
to
the
topic
which
absorbed
him
at
the
time
when
the
london
press
had
been
published
the
disappearance
of
the
prince
had
not
been
known
to
the
world
throughout
the
journey
at
every
fresh
he
repeated
the
performance
dashing
down
platforms
in
quest
of
newsboys
and
purchasing
copies
of
every
journal
on
sale
he
caught
himself
continually
eyeing
his
bag
to
make
sure
that
he
really
had
removed
all
labels
he
began
to
feel
as
if
he
himself
were
the
criminal
in
his
intentions
he
was
already
an
accessory
after
the
fact
whether
santa
was
innocent
or
guilty
at
all
costs
he
had
determined
to
shield
her
through
the
late
summer
afternoon
as
he
drew
nearer
to
london
his
suspense
began
to
die
he
was
getting
the
later
editions
now
none
of
them
so
much
as
mentioned
the
affair
in
plymouth
and
bristol
it
had
probably
been
of
local
importance
he
took
courage
to
smile
what
a
coward
dread
can
make
of
an
honest
man
afternoon
was
fading
into
the
gold
of
evening
when
they
steamed
into
paddington
by
making
haste
he
could
just
reach
the
american
embassy
before
closing
time
it
was
likely
that
several
communications
had
been
addressed
to
him
there
he
had
cabled
ahead
to
the
ritz
for
a
reservation
it
would
take
him
far
out
of
his
direction
to
call
at
the
embassy
on
the
way
to
his
hotel
in
the
stir
and
bustle
of
familiar
london
the
nightmare
of
the
voyage
grew
vague
he
stepped
from
the
carriage
like
a
man
awaking
it
thrilled
him
with
happy
surprise
to
discover
the
old
gray
city
plumed
with
smoke
and
smiling
waiting
unchanged
beneath
his
feet
to
welcome
him
the
very
smell
of
mingled
gasoline
and
horses
from
the
was
reassuring
every
sight
that
his
eyes
encountered
made
him
feel
respectable
luggage
sir
it
was
a
porter
accosting
him
two
trunks
at
least
i
guess
they
on
this
van
sir
one
from
then
with
conscious
bravado
he
added
from
the
you
recognize
them
by
the
the
porter
had
gone
to
secure
a
barrow
while
hindwood
waited
gazing
about
him
idly
his
eyes
were
startled
by
a
bearing
the
following
legend
disappearance
of
a
prince
foul
play
suspected
he
swayed
as
though
he
had
been
struck
by
a
bullet
he
glanced
round
feverishly
fearing
lest
he
might
espy
another
placard
stating
gorlof
but
no
for
the
moment
she
was
safe
he
thanked
god
for
the
and
the
forethought
of
the
foreign
gentleman
who
could
speak
no
english
quickly
he
began
to
readjust
his
plans
if
he
went
to
claim
his
trunks
there
was
no
telling
by
whom
he
might
be
met
newspaper
men
detectives
officials
from
the
foreign
office
moreover
santa
trunks
were
in
the
van
when
he
had
explained
himself
he
might
be
called
upon
to
account
for
her
absence
there
was
only
one
thing
for
him
to
do
for
her
sake
he
must
get
out
of
england
if
he
delayed
he
might
be
prevented
it
would
be
unwise
for
him
to
go
to
the
ritz
he
must
spend
the
night
at
some
obscure
hotel
the
only
place
to
which
he
might
be
traced
was
the
embassy
but
he
would
have
to
risk
that
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
that
he
should
pick
up
his
communications
he
was
on
the
point
of
making
good
his
escape
when
the
porter
trundled
up
with
his
barrow
mister
where
are
you
goin
i
be
needin
you
to
identify
know
you
hindwood
turned
on
him
a
face
which
was
flustered
i
just
remembered
i
have
an
engagement
i
send
for
them
later
it
make
no
difference
to
you
here
what
i
should
have
paid
the
man
having
inspected
it
carefully
pocketed
the
wo
take
long
he
suggested
and
the
barrow
ready
and
it
cost
you
nothink
seein
as
how
you
paid
without
more
ado
he
made
a
dash
for
the
nearest
taxi
fast
as
you
like
he
told
the
driver
faster
the
bigger
your
he
fled
out
of
the
station
at
a
forbidden
rate
but
after
half
a
mile
the
taxi
halted
against
the
curb
lowering
the
window
he
looked
out
the
matter
something
wrong
with
your
engine
ai
been
follered
you
can
calm
down
the
driver
assured
him
soothingly
wrong
is
that
you
ai
told
me
no
of
me
the
american
at
the
embassy
having
explained
his
errand
he
was
requested
to
wait
then
rather
to
his
surprise
instead
of
having
his
letters
handed
to
him
he
was
shown
into
a
handsome
room
where
at
the
far
end
a
man
was
seated
sorting
papers
behind
a
large
mahogany
table
hindwood
crossed
the
room
and
held
out
his
hand
philip
hindwood
the
railroad
expert
i
guess
you
heard
of
me
i
called
in
case
there
was
some
mail
for
me
i
had
no
intention
of
troubling
you
glad
you
come
said
the
man
gravely
you
troubled
me
i
should
have
had
to
trouble
you
there
have
been
inquiries
for
you
they
have
to
do
with
a
woman
who
goes
by
the
name
of
santa
gorlof
the
police
thought
you
might
know
something
about
her
it
seems
she
chapter
the
second
the
return
of
santa
gorlof
i
so
santa
was
why
she
was
wanted
hindwood
did
not
dare
to
question
and
the
police
thought
he
could
tell
them
something
he
could
but
it
would
be
something
to
put
them
off
her
track
after
kissing
a
woman
it
was
likely
he
betray
her
she
might
have
committed
every
crime
on
the
calendar
it
would
make
no
difference
he
had
learned
his
code
of
honor
on
the
outskirts
of
civilization
where
law
is
more
often
defied
than
obeyed
by
his
standards
of
chivalry
after
what
had
passed
between
them
he
had
no
option
but
to
play
the
game
by
her
what
did
they
think
he
knew
why
should
they
think
he
knew
anything
he
masked
his
anxiety
with
seeming
unconcern
without
his
assistance
they
could
make
little
headway
he
must
let
fall
no
hint
that
would
suggest
a
sentimental
interest
in
her
fortunes
he
would
be
spied
on
probably
he
had
been
spied
on
already
for
all
he
knew
the
clergyman
in
the
train
the
porter
at
paddington
the
who
had
assured
him
that
he
was
followed
were
detectives
henceforward
he
must
live
his
life
normally
and
in
public
doing
everything
to
disarm
suspicion
any
divergence
from
his
usual
habits
such
as
staying
in
obscure
quarters
or
canceling
engagements
that
he
might
escape
to
the
continent
would
create
the
impression
that
he
was
possessed
of
guilty
knowledge
if
he
had
to
speak
of
her
he
must
refer
to
her
as
a
charming
acquaintance
and
profess
horror
that
such
a
charge
should
have
been
brought
against
her
following
this
line
he
left
the
embassy
with
the
promise
that
he
would
consult
with
the
police
at
their
earliest
convenience
from
there
he
drove
to
the
ritz
adhering
to
arrangements
made
before
this
sinister
thing
had
happened
to
avoid
being
waylaid
he
went
straight
to
his
rooms
having
ordered
his
trunks
to
be
fetched
from
the
station
and
his
dinner
to
be
served
in
his
apartment
the
suite
allotted
him
was
one
which
he
had
occupied
on
several
previous
occasions
it
soothed
his
ruffled
pride
to
discover
that
his
preferences
had
been
remembered
from
the
front
windows
he
could
gaze
down
piccadilly
from
the
side
he
could
watch
the
green
park
a
lake
of
jade
imprisoned
between
walls
of
granite
in
the
panes
facing
westward
a
fairy
city
hung
poised
tipped
with
flame
and
ensanguined
by
the
sunset
leisurely
he
set
to
work
to
bathe
and
shave
stretching
out
the
ritual
and
reveling
in
the
recovery
of
his
slowly
the
sunset
faded
before
he
had
made
an
end
the
golden
september
dusk
was
drifting
down
in
the
twilight
he
stretched
himself
on
the
bed
waiting
for
his
trunks
with
his
wardrobe
to
arrive
he
felt
that
he
could
face
the
police
with
much
more
calmness
if
he
was
clad
in
the
respectability
of
evening
dress
he
must
have
dozed
for
the
room
was
completely
dark
when
he
was
brought
to
his
feet
by
the
sharp
ringing
of
the
telephone
as
he
fumbled
for
the
receiver
he
thought
i
a
good
reason
for
not
seeing
them
pajamas
are
aloud
he
said
quite
correct
yes
the
hindwood
who
just
landed
from
the
you
traced
me
by
my
trunks
you
were
expecting
i
claim
them
in
person
the
man
from
the
ritz
is
there
that
all
right
thank
you
for
telling
me
what
was
my
reason
certainly
not
i
was
avoiding
no
one
what
did
you
say
you
were
a
i
guess
not
i
nothing
to
tell
no
he
had
scarcely
hung
up
when
the
bell
commenced
ringing
again
the
next
was
spent
in
refusing
to
be
interviewed
by
invisible
persons
it
seemed
as
though
every
journalist
in
london
were
waiting
in
queue
to
get
on
to
him
some
were
suave
some
bullying
all
were
persistent
did
he
know
that
he
owed
it
to
the
public
to
say
something
if
a
list
of
questions
was
submitted
to
him
would
he
make
a
written
statement
to
cut
the
clamor
short
he
instructed
the
hotel
operator
to
allow
no
one
to
speak
with
him
who
would
not
state
his
business
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
he
was
to
any
one
who
had
to
do
with
the
press
after
that
the
telephone
grew
quiet
he
switched
on
the
lights
as
he
did
so
he
noticed
that
he
was
trembling
with
excitement
he
was
furious
this
assault
had
made
him
aware
of
the
unseen
wall
of
hostility
by
which
he
and
santa
were
surrounded
she
had
a
chance
the
whole
of
organized
society
was
against
her
the
odds
were
brutally
unfair
nothing
that
she
had
done
could
warrant
such
unsportsmanly
cruelty
so
far
it
had
not
been
proved
that
she
had
done
anything
yet
every
one
was
willing
to
prejudge
her
the
pursuit
was
cowardly
whether
he
loved
her
did
not
matter
it
was
a
problem
in
to
protect
her
he
was
willing
to
risk
all
that
he
was
and
had
the
arrival
of
his
trunks
gave
him
something
else
to
think
about
when
he
was
dressed
he
felt
ready
for
every
emergency
after
all
he
was
not
the
criminal
he
had
his
dinner
spread
against
a
window
from
which
he
could
watch
the
of
piccadilly
strung
across
the
night
like
a
rope
of
pearls
he
tried
to
be
persuaded
that
he
was
enjoying
himself
if
the
police
did
call
on
him
within
the
hour
he
would
saunter
out
to
a
and
rub
shoulders
with
the
crowd
but
would
he
to
what
purpose
he
would
have
to
go
alone
as
he
always
went
it
would
be
different
if
she
were
with
him
the
last
nine
days
had
spoiled
him
for
loneliness
they
had
taught
him
the
romance
of
a
friendship
and
yet
not
friendship
she
had
asked
for
his
affection
all
his
life
he
had
craved
to
give
his
love
to
some
woman
until
he
had
met
santa
his
craving
had
been
denied
no
woman
had
seemed
to
care
because
of
that
in
spite
of
success
he
had
reckoned
himself
a
failure
he
had
attained
everything
power
position
wealth
everything
except
his
desire
there
had
been
moments
on
the
voyage
when
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
his
goal
was
in
sight
if
she
were
to
tap
on
his
door
how
would
he
greet
her
if
she
did
it
would
be
like
her
she
could
always
be
counted
on
to
do
the
unexpected
he
told
himself
that
he
would
ask
her
no
questions
he
would
not
upbraid
her
he
would
comfort
her
in
the
way
that
she
understood
best
when
the
police
came
to
interrogate
him
he
would
place
his
arm
about
her
and
answer
if
it
is
santa
gorlof
you
are
seeking
she
is
here
i
have
asked
her
to
be
my
the
scene
as
he
conjured
it
was
worthy
of
dumas
he
was
thrilled
by
the
gallantry
of
his
imagination
his
ponderings
were
cut
short
by
a
sharp
rap
he
sprang
to
his
feet
it
almost
seemed
that
his
dream
was
to
be
realized
the
rap
was
repeated
outside
the
door
a
page
was
standing
a
gentleman
downstairs
he
wo
give
his
name
he
says
you
left
word
sir
at
the
american
embassy
that
you
would
be
willing
to
see
him
ii
leaving
the
door
ajar
he
drew
a
chair
to
his
desk
and
commenced
rummaging
through
a
pile
of
documents
he
planned
to
create
the
impression
that
he
regarded
this
visit
as
of
small
importance
he
was
anxious
even
at
the
risk
of
appearing
vulgar
to
be
discovered
in
the
rôle
of
an
american
every
second
of
whose
time
represented
dollars
the
kind
of
man
who
was
too
influential
to
be
bulldozed
by
the
police
methods
of
a
country
whose
citizenship
he
did
not
share
he
urged
himself
into
a
mood
of
contempt
by
recalling
the
beefy
caricatures
which
pass
currency
in
english
fiction
for
veracious
portraits
of
scotland
yard
detectives
this
fellow
would
look
like
a
constable
off
duty
when
he
sat
down
he
would
bulge
at
the
neck
and
mop
his
forehead
with
a
multicolored
handkerchief
he
would
be
awed
by
elegance
into
sulky
stupidity
but
would
become
pompously
affable
when
offered
a
cigar
i
enter
the
door
creaked
come
in
but
you
must
excuse
me
for
a
hindwood
spoke
without
turning
he
pretended
to
be
sorting
the
last
of
his
documents
the
cultured
tone
of
the
voice
had
surprised
him
perhaps
after
all
his
guest
might
not
be
a
detective
to
keep
you
time
valuable
my
stay
in
england
is
short
there
that
finished
what
can
i
do
for
you
he
pushed
back
his
chair
and
rose
to
face
his
guest
if
the
man
intonation
had
surprised
him
his
appearance
amazed
him
still
more
he
could
have
passed
for
the
colonel
of
a
crack
cavalry
regiment
his
bearing
was
erect
and
dapper
his
dark
lounge
suit
with
the
light
stripes
running
through
it
was
so
smartly
tailored
that
one
was
apt
to
suspect
that
he
was
corseted
his
hair
was
white
his
cheeks
tanned
his
manner
cheerful
and
commanding
he
was
of
less
than
medium
height
with
his
bristling
mustache
and
pointed
imperial
he
bore
a
distinct
resemblance
to
lord
roberts
of
kandahar
hindwood
held
out
his
hand
with
undisguised
relief
you
sit
down
sir
i
afraid
i
must
have
seemed
discourteous
the
truth
is
i
was
expecting
some
one
quite
different
the
boy
did
announce
your
name
or
the
stranger
accepted
his
hand
with
an
ironic
smile
he
did
not
sit
down
instead
he
asked
a
question
it
be
wise
to
shut
the
door
without
waiting
for
permission
he
went
to
the
door
and
closed
it
before
he
closed
it
he
glanced
out
into
the
passage
having
regained
the
middle
of
the
room
he
gazed
searchingly
about
him
one
here
who
can
listen
again
taking
matters
into
his
own
hands
he
made
a
swift
and
thorough
investigation
peering
into
the
bathroom
stabbing
draperies
with
his
cane
as
with
a
sword
feeling
behind
clothes
in
cupboards
he
left
no
corner
uninspected
in
which
an
eavesdropper
might
be
secreted
last
of
all
he
approached
the
window
near
which
hindwood
had
dined
for
a
few
seconds
he
stood
there
staring
down
into
the
well
of
blackness
and
the
mysterious
fairyland
of
shifting
lights
laying
aside
his
hat
and
gloves
but
still
retaining
his
cane
he
remarked
very
beautiful
exquisite
with
the
witchery
of
a
face
which
masks
a
hidden
wickedness
hindwood
had
been
regarding
him
in
silence
have
yet
to
learn
your
name
and
business
he
reminded
him
the
stranger
chuckled
name
i
have
almost
forgotten
it
i
assume
so
many
as
for
my
business
i
a
secret
service
agent
in
the
employ
of
the
british
you
credentials
he
produced
from
his
breast
pocket
an
envelope
containing
this
message
typed
on
american
embassy
notepaper
will
serve
to
introduce
the
gentleman
who
is
anxious
to
consult
you
on
the
subject
of
which
we
spoke
this
perhaps
now
you
be
seated
if
you
smoke
i
can
recommend
these
again
the
stranger
with
unruffled
urbanity
betrayed
his
alert
independence
you
have
no
objection
i
prefer
my
you
hindwood
was
determined
to
conduct
the
interview
along
the
lines
of
social
politeness
selecting
a
cigar
himself
he
notched
the
end
entirely
at
your
disposal
there
little
i
can
tell
i
suppose
the
subject
on
which
you
anxious
to
consult
me
is
what
happened
on
the
and
the
stranger
puffed
leisurely
for
a
few
moments
answer
is
yes
if
by
happened
on
the
you
mean
santa
iii
santa
gorlof
hindwood
feigned
surprise
very
charming
lady
the
shrewd
face
puckered
in
a
smile
the
gray
eyes
grew
piercing
beneath
the
beetling
white
brows
i
been
given
to
understand
she
has
a
way
with
the
men
has
our
santa
even
prince
rogovich
old
hand
that
he
was
fell
for
her
i
believe
that
your
expressive
phrase
in
america
he
fell
for
her
in
every
sense
especially
when
she
pushed
him
hindwood
frowned
he
realized
that
a
game
had
commenced
in
which
he
had
been
allotted
the
rôle
of
mouse
he
resented
the
levity
with
which
santa
name
had
been
mentioned
if
the
man
was
in
earnest
the
matter
was
too
terrible
for
jest
though
he
had
harbored
the
same
suspicion
to
hear
it
stated
as
a
fact
appalled
him
the
charge
sounded
dastardly
spoken
in
that
pleasant
voice
by
this
courtly
english
gentleman
who
was
old
enough
to
be
her
father
with
an
effort
he
kept
command
of
his
composure
course
joking
in
the
in
plain
american
you
accusing
a
beautiful
and
fascinating
woman
of
what
else
hindwood
shrugged
his
shoulders
my
density
i
did
catch
on
it
was
your
appearance
misled
me
you
look
so
much
a
flatter
myself
that
there
are
occasions
when
i
i
guess
we
have
to
reckon
this
occasion
an
exception
i
might
remind
you
that
it
a
woman
you
accusing
and
that
the
penalty
for
murder
is
death
scarcely
a
subject
to
make
merry
over
with
a
play
upon
words
you
reminding
me
the
stranger
added
gently
if
a
woman
you
and
i
are
men
you
trying
to
tell
me
that
if
my
supposition
is
correct
then
all
that
ravishing
caprice
that
we
know
as
santa
gorlof
will
have
to
be
ruthlessly
blotted
out
possibly
picturing
as
so
many
of
her
victims
have
pictured
before
you
the
wealth
of
happiness
that
might
be
yours
if
you
could
win
her
for
hindwood
hand
trembled
as
he
flicked
his
ash
dear
sir
he
drawled
not
twenty
i
a
man
of
the
world
you
credit
me
with
too
much
romance
in
your
profession
you
trained
to
spin
theories
please
leave
me
out
stick
to
your
assertion
you
come
to
me
accusing
a
woman
of
my
acquaintance
i
can
hardly
call
her
a
friend
of
having
committed
murder
the
charge
sounds
preposterous
why
you
should
come
to
me
at
all
i
can
not
guess
before
we
go
further
i
have
a
right
to
ask
a
question
is
this
mere
conjecture
or
can
you
prove
it
can
prove
the
stranger
paused
studying
the
despair
his
words
had
caused
can
prove
then
he
added
you
i
perjure
scowling
hindwood
leaped
to
his
feet
was
what
you
meant
at
your
time
of
life
i
should
have
thought
you
could
have
found
a
less
infamous
way
of
gaining
your
livelihood
there
your
hat
and
there
the
the
mocking
old
gentleman
went
through
the
dumb
show
of
clapping
his
applause
he
settled
himself
more
deeply
in
his
chair
when
he
spoke
it
was
with
the
lazy
of
a
man
at
his
club
fill
me
with
admiration
your
last
attitude
was
superb
i
have
only
one
criticism
to
offer
of
your
by
letting
your
cigar
go
out
you
betrayed
the
perturbation
you
were
trying
to
disguise
it
been
dead
three
he
raised
his
hand
delaying
interruption
be
angry
i
not
doubting
your
momentary
sincerity
but
think
back
and
then
own
that
you
also
have
suspected
that
she
your
memory
must
be
faulty
allow
me
to
prompt
you
with
a
few
then
and
there
without
hesitation
or
boasting
he
detailed
to
hindwood
all
his
actions
from
his
departure
from
the
to
the
moment
when
he
had
arrived
at
the
embassy
hindwood
listened
to
the
narration
dumfounded
you
see
he
concluded
i
can
tell
you
so
much
as
this
there
is
probably
much
more
that
i
could
tell
you
been
infatuated
by
a
what
she
did
to
prince
rogovich
she
has
done
to
at
least
a
dozen
of
her
admirers
she
would
have
done
the
same
to
you
because
there
have
been
moments
when
you
thought
you
loved
her
you
unwilling
to
hand
her
over
to
justice
you
even
willing
to
risk
your
own
good
name
in
her
defense
it
of
you
but
she
undeserving
of
your
loyalty
when
you
know
the
truth
you
thank
your
lucky
stars
that
i
came
iv
hindwood
face
had
gone
ashen
not
through
fear
for
his
own
safety
but
for
hers
he
was
determined
not
to
believe
a
word
of
what
he
had
heard
and
yet
he
was
curious
to
learn
there
was
such
an
air
of
complete
conviction
about
the
stranger
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
the
integrity
of
his
intentions
what
he
hoped
was
to
discover
some
flaw
in
his
logic
sinking
back
into
his
chair
he
stared
in
silence
at
the
man
who
believed
he
knew
everything
remembering
that
his
cigar
had
gone
out
he
commenced
searching
through
his
pockets
for
a
match
at
your
elbow
the
stranger
informed
him
not
there
on
the
table
i
upset
you
more
than
i
again
they
lapsed
into
silence
at
last
hindwood
said
owe
you
an
apology
i
been
insulting
but
the
blame
is
partly
yours
you
did
explain
yourself
you
withheld
your
identity
i
was
expecting
a
kind
of
policeman
but
i
think
you
understand
anyhow
i
regret
my
rudeness
now
tell
me
who
are
you
major
cleasby
formerly
of
the
indian
army
my
main
hobby
is
studying
the
hindwood
looked
up
sharply
he
remembered
the
impression
santa
had
made
on
him
that
if
her
eyes
had
been
darker
she
could
have
passed
for
a
hindoo
princess
do
see
what
studying
the
asiatic
has
to
do
with
the
disappearance
of
prince
rogovich
he
said
we
going
to
arrive
anywhere
what
we
need
is
frankness
i
think
you
ought
to
understand
my
side
of
the
the
major
nodded
to
start
with
i
unmarried
not
that
i
a
but
my
life
has
been
too
packed
with
important
undertakings
to
leave
me
much
time
to
spare
on
women
i
been
a
kind
of
express
stopping
only
at
cities
and
rushing
by
all
the
villages
on
the
i
was
forced
to
come
to
rest
it
so
happened
that
santa
gorlof
was
the
village
at
which
i
halted
the
as
you
know
is
one
of
these
floating
palaces
she
does
attract
the
flashy
type
of
traveler
the
company
on
this
last
voyage
was
dull
dull
to
the
point
of
tears
the
prince
and
santa
gorlof
were
the
two
exceptions
i
got
to
know
her
first
and
the
prince
later
it
was
i
who
introduced
her
to
him
we
were
each
of
us
a
bit
at
first
we
drifted
together
against
our
wills
in
an
attempt
to
escape
from
boredom
then
we
began
to
expect
each
other
till
finally
we
were
two
men
and
a
woman
with
nothing
to
distract
us
it
an
old
story
the
usual
thing
happened
i
suppose
you
call
it
a
flirtation
in
which
the
prince
and
i
were
rivals
first
santa
was
strictly
impartial
toward
the
end
it
was
the
prince
she
favored
i
afraid
i
got
huffy
which
was
distinctly
childish
for
none
of
us
was
serious
we
were
two
men
and
a
beautiful
woman
at
loose
ends
rather
dangerously
amusing
ourselves
at
plymouth
if
things
had
terminated
normally
we
should
have
come
to
our
senses
and
gone
our
separate
ways
at
most
we
should
have
said
on
reaching
london
in
none
of
our
dealings
had
there
been
the
least
hint
of
anything
serious
nothing
that
would
suggest
a
speaking
for
myself
my
interest
in
santa
had
been
on
the
wane
for
several
days
before
we
landed
i
should
have
parted
with
her
on
the
dock
without
compunction
if
this
extraordinary
disappearance
had
occurred
it
was
that
that
again
drew
us
together
neither
of
us
was
willing
to
believe
the
worst
we
both
tried
to
persuade
ourselves
that
he
changed
his
plans
at
the
last
moment
at
the
same
time
we
were
both
a
little
anxious
lest
we
might
be
bothered
with
questions
and
detained
probably
it
was
to
avoid
any
such
annoyance
that
she
dodged
her
breakfast
engagement
with
me
and
escaped
so
early
this
the
major
thrust
himself
forward
resting
his
chin
on
the
handle
of
his
cane
was
her
presuming
her
guilt
why
was
it
forget
the
foreigner
who
wore
goggles
and
pretended
he
speak
english
she
could
possibly
have
sent
him
word
the
necessity
for
her
escape
must
have
been
foreseen
and
the
means
hindwood
puzzled
to
find
some
more
innocent
explanation
might
have
been
her
speak
as
though
you
knew
then
with
a
catch
in
his
breath
is
arrested
she
were
i
should
tell
what
makes
you
so
positive
that
he
was
her
husband
the
major
drew
himself
erect
smiling
palely
am
her
v
hindwood
rose
and
moved
over
to
the
window
he
felt
mentally
stifled
he
leaned
out
gazing
down
into
the
pool
of
blackness
along
whose
floor
like
the
phosphorescence
of
fishes
lights
drifted
and
darted
the
sight
of
so
much
coolness
quieted
him
when
he
turned
the
major
had
not
moved
a
muscle
he
was
sitting
as
he
had
left
him
erect
and
palely
smiling
not
be
surprised
when
i
tell
you
major
cleasby
that
your
last
piece
of
information
completely
overwhelms
me
you
come
to
me
in
the
rôle
of
a
secret
service
agent
and
now
you
claim
to
be
her
you
mean
me
to
understand
that
you
accumulating
the
evidence
that
will
convict
your
wife
her
and
i
regret
to
say
hang
her
stated
baldly
that
is
my
hindwood
perched
himself
on
the
window
ledge
and
regarded
his
guest
intently
he
did
look
a
monster
he
looked
in
all
respects
a
kindly
gentleman
and
yet
if
what
he
had
just
heard
was
correct
there
were
few
monsters
in
history
who
could
compare
with
him
hindwood
tried
to
picture
him
as
santa
husband
he
could
he
was
thankful
that
he
could
for
a
reason
which
he
did
not
distress
himself
to
analyze
he
did
wish
to
believe
that
she
had
ever
had
a
husband
as
for
the
hints
about
her
criminal
record
and
her
many
lovers
he
utterly
rejected
them
was
it
likely
that
a
woman
so
royal
and
aloof
could
have
stooped
to
the
gutter
but
if
these
accusations
were
not
true
what
was
their
object
either
it
was
a
case
of
mistaken
identity
and
there
were
two
santa
gorlofs
or
the
object
was
to
infuriate
him
with
jealousy
so
that
he
would
blurt
out
all
he
knew
he
eyed
the
major
doubtfully
he
was
insane
he
did
look
a
rascal
and
yet
what
husband
in
his
senses
he
began
to
notice
details
the
major
was
less
old
than
he
had
fancied
at
first
he
was
more
worn
than
aged
illness
or
tragedy
might
have
whitened
him
it
was
even
possible
that
he
had
made
himself
up
for
the
part
he
was
playing
his
eyes
were
clear
and
his
hands
virile
with
the
mustache
and
imperial
removed
cleasby
you
ask
me
to
accept
a
great
deal
on
your
bare
word
he
said
politely
come
to
me
with
nothing
to
introduce
you
but
the
most
briefly
formal
letter
the
moment
you
enter
my
room
before
have
anything
to
do
with
me
you
inspect
every
as
though
i
were
a
counterfeiter
or
an
anarchist
you
boldly
announce
to
me
that
ever
since
i
landed
in
england
you
had
me
followed
and
observed
you
use
the
results
of
your
spying
as
a
kind
of
blackmail
to
induce
me
to
present
you
with
the
sort
of
evidence
for
which
you
searching
you
trick
me
into
telling
you
about
a
shipboard
flirtation
with
a
woman
whom
you
say
you
want
convicted
of
murder
no
sooner
have
i
told
you
than
you
declare
that
you
yourself
are
married
to
her
i
ought
to
refuse
to
allow
this
interview
to
go
further
without
calling
in
a
lawyer
i
mean
to
be
offensive
but
your
kaleidoscopic
changes
put
a
strain
on
my
credulity
i
ca
believe
your
story
that
you
a
secret
service
agent
endeavoring
to
get
your
wife
executed
when
men
tire
of
matrimony
they
find
less
ingenious
methods
of
recovering
their
the

his

affability

my
bachelorhood

recover

my

mind
hindwood
cut
in
like
to
finish
my
say
first
one
of
the
things
that
you
may
not
have
learned
is
that
i
here
on
a
mission
of
international
dimensions
it
concerns
more
than
one
of
the
governments
of
europe
i
ca
afford
to
have
my
name
mixed
up
in
a
scandal
and
what
more
i
can
bring
influences
to
bear
to
prevent
it
from
being
introduced

you

that
would
enable
you
to
bring
this
gorlof

to
trial
you
on
the
wrong

i
have
no
such
knowledge
the
longer
you
stay
here
the
more
you
waste
my
the
major
was
on
the
point
of
answering
when
the
telephone
rang
shrilly
grateful
for
a
diversion
hindwood
crossed
the
room
as
he
unhooked
the
receiver
he
glanced
across
his
shoulder
this
hindwood
it
was
the
hotel
operator
asking
a
call
for
you
sir
it
from
some
one
who
not
on
a
newspaper
will
you
take
it
there
was
a
pause
while
the
connection
was
being
made
then
a
foreign
voice
a
woman
questioned
thees
meester
hindwood
eef
you
please
one
meenute
a
lady
wants
to
talk
wiz
coming
across
the
distance
subdued
and
earnest
he
caught
the
tones
of
a
voice
which
was
instantly
familiar
be
startled
do
answer
me
there
a
man
with
you
tell
him
nothing
if
you
ever
loved
me
even
for
a
second
do
believe
a
word
he
she
had
not
been
arrested
a
wave
of
joy
swept
over
him
the
uncertainty
as
to
whether
she
was
arrested
had
been
crushing
him
he
waited
hoping
she
would
speak
again
shattering
the
spell
with
a
touch
of
bathos
the
operator
inquired
with
that
he
rang
off
as
he
raised
his
head
he
had
the
uncomfortable
sensation
that
the
major
had
turned
away
from
watching
him
vi
so
you
want
to
be
rid
of
me
the
major
glanced
across
his
shoulder
at
the
same
time
making
no
effort
to
remove
himself
hindwood
crossed
the
room
thoughtfully
and
seated
himself
made
no
secret
of
it
from
the
moment
you
the
major
laughed
genially
do
blame
you
you
think
i
a
wronged
husband
trying
to
get
even
or
else
an
unscrupulous
detective
baiting
traps
with
falsehoods
the
situation
unpleasant
for
you
glad
you
realize
assure
you
i
do
you
given
yourself
away
think
so
do
think
i
know
what
you
told
me
proves
beyond
a
doubt
that
you
possessed
of
exactly
the
knowledge
that
would
bring
santa
gorlof
to
observant
you
wondering
what
makes
me
so
certain
the
explanation
simple
i
studied
santa
tactics
her
strategy
the
same
in
every
instance
when
a
man
suspects
her
guilt
she
does
what
she
did
to
you
seals
his
mouth
with
is
too
hindwood
brought
his
fist
down
with
a
bang
you
go
or
do
i
have
to
force
you
time
i
try
one
of
with
astounding
assurance
the
major
helped
himself
to
one
of
cigars
which
he
had
previously
rejected
without
bravado
he
lighted
it
and
having
ascertained
that
it
was
drawing
continued
you
used
force
you
regret
it
you
make
certain
of
the
unwelcome
publicity
you
so
anxious
to
avoid
you
miss
a
stranger
story
than
any
arabian
tale
that
ever
was
concocted
you
think
you
can
still
touch
bottom
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
already
out
of
sight
of
land
you
sit
there
looking
an
average
successful
american
actually
you
become
an
heroic
figure
adrift
upon
an
ocean
so
romantic
and
uncharted
that
it
beats
upon
the
cliffs
of
every
human
hindwood
shifted
uneasily
you
a
fortuneteller
in
addition
to
being
an
husband
and
a
detective
ignoring
his
sarcasm
the
major
proceeded
time
ago
you
accused
me
of
ingenuity
in
the
means
i
had
adopted
to
recover
my
bachelorhood
not
my
bachelorhood
but
my
own
and
my
country
honor
that
with
your
help
i
endeavoring
to
recover
that
sounds
extravagant
but
consider
what
motive
could
be
sufficiently
extravagant
to
compel
a
man
to
bend
all
his
energies
toward
bringing
the
woman
whom
he
loves
to
the
scaffold
because
i
say
it
calmly
you
doubt
that
i
love
her
what
man
could
help
loving
her
she
the
last
of
a
long
line
of
false
fair
women
who
stirred
up
madness
and
left
behind
a
trail
of
rising
wearily
hindwood
turned
his
back
and
commenced
fingering
the
documents
on
his
desk
be
nothing
gained
by
carrying
this
discussion
with
a
question
the
major
recaptured
his
attention
it
ever
strike
you
that
she
partly
asiatic
hindwood
swung
round
surprised
into
truth
makes
you
ask
it
vii
even
to
myself
the
major
sighed
story
which
i
am
about
to
tell
sounds
incredible
my
reason
for
confiding
it
to
a
stranger
is
that
when
you
have
heard
it
you
may
dispense
with
chivalry
and
become
stern
enough
to
do
your
duty
to
protect
a
woman
whatever
her
age
or
looks
is
an
instinct
as
primitive
as
religion
when
she
happens
to
be
beautiful
and
the
object
of
your
affection
not
to
protect
her
is
a
kind
of
blasphemy
you
and
i
though
you
deny
it
are
both
in
love
with
santa
i
am
her
husband
while
you
are
no
more
than
her
admirer
yet
you
in
her
hour
of
danger
are
prepared
to
shield
her
with
your
honor
whereas
i
am
among
the
most
relentless
of
her
pursuers
best
part
of
my
life
has
been
spent
in
india
i
went
there
with
my
regiment
when
i
was
little
more
than
a
boy
the
fascination
of
an
ancient
civilization
took
possession
of
my
imagination
i
became
a
student
of
it
and
soon
acquired
a
knowledge
of
native
habits
which
was
more
fitting
to
a
secret
agent
than
to
a
soldier
i
learned
to
speak
many
dialects
and
could
pass
myself
off
as
an
asiatic
with
the
minimum
amount
of
disguise
instead
of
frequenting
clubs
and
idling
away
my
leisure
in
the
usual
round
of
social
futilities
which
make
up
the
average
life
i
formed
the
practice
of
slipping
out
into
the
night
and
losing
my
identity
in
the
teeming
oriental
by
which
i
was
surrounded
one
of
my
wanderings
when
or
where
it
is
not
necessary
to
particularize
i
strolled
into
a
temple
and
saw
a
young
girl
dancing
as
perhaps
you
know
girls
are
dedicated
to
the
worship
of
certain
gods
and
goddesses
at
a
very
early
age
they
are
for
the
most
part
deities
who
symbolize
fecundity
the
ritual
with
which
they
are
celebrated
is
gross
the
temple
girls
are
chosen
for
their
beauty
and
are
trained
by
the
priesthood
to
perform
sensual
dances
which
are
as
old
as
time
they
are
not
nuns
or
priestesses
their
social
status
if
they
may
be
said
to
have
any
in
a
land
where
woman
is
at
best
a
plaything
approximates
to
that
of
temple
slaves
they
are
taken
from
their
parents
at
an
age
when
sahibs
children
are
in
nurseries
from
the
moment
they
are
dedicated
their
minds
and
souls
are
left
to
stagnate
they
are
treated
like
performing
animals
fed
and
drilled
and
degraded
that
they
may
employ
their
bodies
with
the
utmost
grace
girl
the
moment
i
saw
her
impressed
me
as
being
the
most
fascinating
human
creature
i
had
ever
set
eyes
on
i
had
pressed
in
with
the
crowd
from
the
moonlit
street
the
temple
was
dim
with
the
smoke
of
swaying
censers
its
walls
seemed
vast
with
the
flash
of
gold
and
jewels
at
the
far
end
scarcely
discernible
a
huge
god
squatted
gloating
and
sinister
from
somewhere
in
the
shadows
swelling
into
frenzy
came
the
pounding
of
drums
and
the
clash
of
barbaric
music
across
the
open
pavement
between
the
god
and
the
spectators
a
chain
of
girls
coiled
and
twisted
like
a
snake
the
time
i
entered
the
dance
was
nearly
ended
it
had
evidently
been
going
on
for
a
long
while
one
by
one
the
girls
were
slipping
down
exhausted
there
they
lay
disordered
with
their
hair
twined
about
them
and
their
slim
bronze
bodies
twitching
one
girl
danced
on
ever
quickening
her
pace
till
she
alone
remained
she
was
like
a
streak
of
flame
a
a
spring
petal
blown
before
the
wind
she
seemed
the
symbol
of
everything
that
is
young
and
pagan
her
childish
face
was
masked
in
an
unchanging
smile
her
lips
were
parted
her
body
gleamed
golden
among
the
muted
lights
she
stooped
and
darted
like
a
lizard
across
her
fallen
comrades
with
one
leap
she
floated
through
the
air
perched
for
a
moment
on
the
knees
of
the
god
and
vanished
into
his
bosom
instantly
the
censers
were
extinguished
and
i
was
carried
out
into
the
street
by
the
rush
of
the
perspiring
crowd
that
night
it
was
as
though
i
were
bewitched
there
was
never
an
hour
when
that
drifting
blossom
of
a
girl
was
absent
from
my
mind
i
idealized
her
into
a
nobility
that
was
more
than
earthly
i
flung
aside
all
sense
of
caste
and
race
i
forgot
that
i
was
a
sahib
and
over
thirty
whereas
she
was
a
dancing
girl
and
little
more
than
a
child
i
excused
my
infatuation
on
the
ground
of
magnanimity
telling
myself
that
if
i
could
possess
her
i
could
save
her
from
certain
degradation
above
all
i
wanted
to
wipe
out
her
houri
smile
and
to
cause
the
soul
to
appear
in
her
eyes
every
hour
that
i
could
spare
i
disguised
myself
as
a
native
and
haunted
the
temple
at
rare
intervals
i
caught
glimpses
of
her
and
so
six
months
went
by
my
desire
strengthened
into
determination
i
was
insane
with
chivalry
utterly
quixotic
as
quixotic
as
you
are
now
i
had
raised
her
to
such
a
pinnacle
of
worship
that
a
liaison
was
not
to
be
contemplated
what
i
planned
was
to
carry
her
off
and
marry
her
when
you
remember
the
gulf
which
the
places
between
himself
and
the
races
he
governs
you
can
estimate
the
measure
of
my
madness
such
an
act
would
entail
resigning
from
my
regiment
and
inviting
social
ostracism
on
every
hand
it
meant
ruin
but
to
my
impassioned
mind
no
price
seemed
too
high
to
pay
was
an
old
priest
who
unknown
to
me
had
observed
my
comings
and
goings
one
evening
he
addressed
me
by
name
while
i
was
hesitating
as
to
what
could
be
his
motive
he
volunteered
to
obtain
the
girl
for
me
if
i
would
reward
him
with
a
sufficient
bribe
nights
later
as
i
waited
a
door
in
the
temple
wall
opened
and
a
muffled
figure
emerged
without
a
word
obeying
the
instructions
i
had
received
i
turned
away
and
she
followed
through
the
sleeping
city
we
crept
like
a
pair
of
shadows
the
european
quarter
i
had
secretly
rented
a
bungalow
which
had
long
been
deserted
it
stood
in
a
wilderness
of
overgrown
shrubberies
a
high
wall
went
about
it
not
until
the
rusty
gate
had
closed
behind
us
did
i
dare
to
acknowledge
her
presence
then
taking
her
in
my
arms
i
carried
her
up
the
path
to
the
unlighted
house
we
entered
there
were
just
the
two
of
us
i
had
not
risked
engaging
servants
in
the
darkness
i
set
her
down
and
lighted
a
lamp
as
the
flame
quickened
and
i
knelt
beside
her
she
uncovered
her
face
so
far
i
had
seen
her
only
distantly
it
was
the
moment
for
which
i
had
waited
her
face
was
the
major
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
his
lips
tightened
he
betrayed
every
sign
of
a
man
doing
his
best
to
conceal
an
overpowering
emotion
he
leaned
back
and
gazed
up
at
the
ceiling
blowing
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
when
he
had
watched
it
disperse
he
turned
to
hindwood
with
a
deprecating
smile
hope
i
do
bore
you
i
omit
the
ardors
and
ecstasies
of
my
and
stick
to
the
bare
outline
what
i
discovered
was
that
she
was
an
eurasian
she
was
fourteen
years
of
age
a
woman
by
indian
standards
but
still
a
child
by
ours
her
eyes
were
gray
and
her
complexion
was
so
light
that
with
any
one
but
an
expert
she
could
have
passed
for
a
european
there
are
millions
of
darkhaired
women
with
her
coloring
to
be
found
in
any
latin
country
given
the
proper
manners
and
a
european
setting
scarcely
a
soul
would
have
suspected
her
certainly
no
one
would
dare
to
voice
his
suspicions
who
met
her
as
my
wife
history
i
pieced
together
from
many
conversations
her
father
had
been
a
an
englishman
of
good
family
her
mother
had
been
a
burmese
they
both
had
died
in
a
cholera
epidemic
their
child
had
been
picked
up
from
the
highways
and
placed
in
the
temple
that
i
was
out
to
be
chivalrous
i
made
up
my
mind
to
do
the
thing
thoroughly
i
hurried
up
a
furlough
that
was
due
me
and
taking
her
to
france
placed
her
in
a
convent
my
reason
for
choosing
france
was
that
when
she
became
my
wife
there
would
be
fewer
chances
of
discovery
if
she
passed
as
french
instead
of
english
in
the
south
especially
in
provence
there
are
many
women
of
her
type
descended
from
the
saracens
if
you
been
to
arles
you
must
have
noticed
them
at
the
end
of
three
years
when
she
was
seventeen
i
returned
married
her
and
took
her
back
to
india
if
any
one
detected
the
deception
no
one
was
bold
enough
to
proclaim
it
every
circumstance
argued
against
such
a
surmise
she
had
forgotten
much
of
the
english
she
had
known
and
pretended
to
speak
only
french
i
had
coached
her
in
her
part
she
acted
it
to
perfection
by
no
hint
or
sign
did
she
let
the
knowledge
escape
her
that
she
could
understand
a
word
of
any
native
dialect
so
far
as
i
am
aware
she
was
accepted
at
her
face
value
as
a
young
provençal
whom
i
had
courted
in
her
own
country
some
time
my
romantic
folly
brought
us
nothing
but
happiness
we
invented
a
legend
to
account
for
her
family
which
through
continual
repetition
we
almost
came
to
believe
ourselves
no
two
people
were
ever
more
in
love
despite
our
difference
in
age
and
the
racial
gulf
which
divided
us
no
man
and
woman
ever
seemed
more
wisely
mated
apparently
whatever
shameful
knowledge
she
had
acquired
in
the
temple
had
been
blotted
out
by
her
superimposed
refinement
even
to
me
she
betrayed
no
hint
of
grossness
she
appeared
to
be
as
sweet
and
innocent
as
the
girl
i
claimed
her
to
be
the
girl
i
said
i
had
surprised
in
the
passionless
tranquility
of
a
french
convent
devotion
to
myself
was
pathetic
it
verged
on
adoration
she
was
continually
contriving
new
ways
of
rewarding
me
for
the
horrors
from
which
i
had
saved
her
to
me
the
ground
she
trod
was
sacred
i
delighted
in
making
myself
her
slave
we
competed
with
each
other
in
generosity
with
each
of
us
the
other
slightest
whim
was
law
she
was
unbelievably
beautiful
the
most
mysteriously
beautiful
woman
in
india
i
was
more
than
twice
her
years
and
the
envy
of
every
man
who
saw
her
her
beauty
seemed
only
the
outshining
of
her
goodness
save
for
an
accident
i
should
never
have
known
otherwise
had
been
married
two
years
when
she
bore
me
a
child
our
dread
when
we
knew
that
she
was
to
become
a
mother
was
that
our
offspring
might
reveal
the
asiatic
strain
we
took
every
precaution
to
hide
the
fact
if
this
should
happen
but
even
this
was
spared
us
our
boy
was
and
as
any
she
worshiped
him
he
seemed
to
symbolize
heaven
blessing
on
the
lie
we
practiced
he
was
never
out
of
her
sight
in
her
fear
lest
he
might
develop
some
native
characteristic
she
refused
to
have
an
and
cared
for
him
entirely
wherever
she
went
she
kept
him
with
her
he
slept
in
our
room
at
night
so
perfectly
had
she
drilled
herself
that
up
to
this
point
i
can
not
recall
an
instance
in
which
she
had
fallen
below
the
level
of
a
white
woman
it
was
the
finest
instinct
in
her
nature
that
proved
her
undoing
her
that
trapped
her
into
the
which
produced
our
tragedy
child
was
a
sturdy
little
fellow
of
nearly
two
just
beginning
to
run
about
when
suddenly
he
died
we
had
a
at
the
time
his
mother
was
playing
tennis
while
she
was
playing
he
was
strangled
and
thrown
down
a
well
by
a
native
servant
who
believed
he
had
been
slighted
my
wife
missing
the
child
went
in
search
of
him
in
panic
and
caught
the
native
in
the
act
of
getting
rid
of
the
body
instantly
she
reverted
to
what
her
mother
had
been
before
her
snatching
the
knife
she
killed
him
before
any
of
her
guests
could
restrain
her
in
the
abandonment
of
her
grief
she
became
an
out
and
out
burmese
woman
scattering
dust
on
her
hair
beating
her
breasts
and
rending
her
clothes
with
the
wildest
lamentations
the
fiction
of
her
french
origin
was
utterly
destroyed
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
among
those
who
witnessed
her
that
i
was
married
to
an
eurasian
position
at
once
became
intolerable
a
halfcaste
is
despised
the
world
over
but
in
india
especially
that
night
every
servant
left
none
of
our
friends
came
near
us
we
sat
alone
with
our
grief
in
a
deserted
house
as
her
calmness
returned
she
grew
tragically
contrite
not
contrite
from
any
moral
sense
but
because
she
had
given
away
our
secret
she
seemed
incapable
of
appreciating
that
she
had
done
any
wrong
in
depriving
justice
of
its
victim
when
i
tried
to
explain
to
her
that
she
had
committed
a
crime
she
shook
her
head
impatiently
insisting
that
she
had
done
what
any
mother
ought
to
do
under
the
circumstances
when
i
pressed
the
subject
she
became
persuaded
that
i
too
was
blaming
her
and
then
that
i
had
never
properly
loved
either
her
or
her
child
and
yet
i
think
i
never
loved
her
more
tenderly
than
at
that
moment
week
later
after
miserable
days
and
nights
of
suspense
we
received
our
sentence
native
sedition
was
running
high
the
government
did
not
dare
to
bring
the
wife
of
a
british
officer
to
trial
such
a
course
would
have
proved
too
damaging
to
the
prestige
of
officialdom
i
was
promised
that
the
scandal
would
be
hushed
up
and
i
should
be
given
a
new
employment
if
i
would
agree
to
ship
her
out
of
india
at
once
and
to
see
to
it
that
she
never
returned
what
it
amounted
to
for
me
was
perpetual
separation
and
for
her
perpetual
banishment
have
often
tried
to
arrive
at
a
sane
conclusion
as
to
how
far
i
am
the
author
of
what
she
has
become
had
i
shared
her
banishment
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
her
white
blood
would
have
kept
control
of
her
poisoned
heritage
unfortunately
i
had
a
living
to
earn
professionally
i
was
broken
my
savings
were
inconsiderable
i
had
her
to
maintain
i
was
past
and
by
leaving
india
would
have
sacrificed
the
pension
that
was
already
in
sight
moreover
i
knew
of
no
way
of
marketing
my
training
in
any
country
outside
india
so
i
played
safe
and
bowed
to
authority
i
resigned
from
my
regiment
and
was
transferred
to
the
department
of
military
intelligence
after
knowing
the
security
of
a
home
and
wife
at
past
forty
i
became
a
secret
agent
a
spy
and
a
wanderer
a
friendless
and
unfriendly
man
unsociable
and
socially
unacceptable
as
for
my
wife
aged
only
she
was
exiled
to
england
a
stranger
in
a
gray
chill
country
bankrupt
in
her
happiness
with
no
one
to
defend
her
taking
with
her
the
temptation
of
her
unusual
beauty
and
the
treacherous
inheritance
of
her
intermingled
blood
seemed
no
justice
in
the
world
for
either
of
us
the
offending
cause
of
our
punishment
was
the
protective
motherhood
which
had
prompted
her
to
slay
the
killer
of
our
child
but
to
use
your
terse
americanism
we
were
against
blind
angers
and
racial
prejudices
which
no
amount
of
bucking
on
our
part
could
change
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
even
before
her
life
had
started
she
had
been
condemned
the
initial
sin
had
been
her
parents
when
they
had
allowed
themselves
to
create
her
before
she
had
seen
daylight
the
uncharity
of
mankind
had
proclaimed
her
a
and
a
pariah
from
her
inherited
fate
i
had
tried
to
snatch
her
when
i
had
bought
her
from
the
temple
you
may
say
that
my
recklessness
was
nothing
more
than
selfishness
pharisaically
parading
as
chivalry
in
allowing
her
to
bear
me
a
child
i
had
only
reduplicated
the
crime
of
her
parents
nevertheless
i
had
tried
to
rescue
her
and
could
have
succeeded
had
not
her
ensnared
her
she
was
betrayed
by
the
purest
instinct
in
her
nature
she
was
shown
no
more
leniency
than
if
it
had
been
the
basest
there
lay
the
cruelty
that
rankled
she
was
judged
not
by
motives
but
by
results
she
would
have
been
pardoned
and
applauded
had
she
been
a
white
woman
spite
of
all
these
accumulated
injustices
i
believe
she
would
have
retained
the
strength
to
go
straight
had
there
been
any
limit
to
our
separation
there
was
none
for
all
the
comfort
that
i
could
be
to
her
i
might
just
as
well
have
been
dead
or
divorced
from
her
i
was
all
that
remained
out
of
the
ruin
that
had
overtaken
her
yet
the
most
to
which
she
could
look
forward
save
for
brief
meetings
at
long
intervals
was
that
i
would
be
restored
to
her
in
my
useless
old
age
when
the
glorious
floodtide
of
her
youth
hud
receded
you
see
i
am
sufficiently
unbiased
to
be
able
to
plead
her
the
major
rose
and
going
over
to
the
window
stood
with
his
back
toward
hindwood
gazing
out
into
the
night
some
minutes
had
elapsed
when
he
turned
quietly
had
i
got
to
ah
yes
to
where
i
had
to
send
her
to
england
i
accompanied
her
to
calcutta
to
see
her
safely
on
the
liner
shall
i
ever
forget
that
journey
it
had
the
gloom
of
a
funeral
and
the
frenzy
of
an
elopement
actually
my
rôle
was
that
of
a
policeman
deporting
a
miscreant
who
happened
to
be
his
wife
we
tried
to
pack
into
moments
the
emotions
of
a
lifetime
as
background
to
our
was
the
poignant
memory
of
the
puzzled
child
whom
seven
years
earlier
i
had
escorted
on
the
same
journey
for
france
where
she
was
to
be
made
over
into
a
sahib
lady
in
her
wondering
attitude
toward
the
fortunes
that
assailed
her
she
was
little
changed
she
was
still
startlingly
unsophisticated
a
dangerously
credulous
and
deceivingly
unversed
in
masculine
wiles
i
had
taught
her
to
be
so
dependent
that
i
dared
not
imagine
how
she
would
do
without
me
she
was
so
artless
she
took
such
pleasure
in
admiration
love
was
so
necessary
to
her
it
was
the
breath
of
her
life
its
misuse
had
been
the
breath
and
the
means
of
life
of
her
burmese
mother
before
her
complete
lack
of
comprehension
that
i
in
any
way
shared
her
sacrifice
formed
the
most
distressing
part
of
my
ordeal
she
assumed
that
she
was
being
exiled
by
ray
choice
she
persisted
in
talking
as
if
she
could
stay
if
i
would
only
change
my
mind
though
she
did
not
accuse
me
in
words
she
believed
that
i
was
ridding
myself
of
her
because
she
had
disgraced
me
that
i
was
pushing
her
across
the
horizon
where
she
would
be
forgotten
and
out
of
sight
up
to
the
last
moment
she
pleaded
with
and
coaxed
me
as
though
it
were
i
who
was
refusing
to
repeal
her
sentence
the
ship
cast
off
bearing
her
from
me
with
her
broken
heart
and
her
embittered
memories
of
the
grave
while
i
turned
back
to
ferret
through
the
gutters
of
asia
that
i
might
earn
the
wherewithal
to
provide
for
her
first
she
wrote
many
times
a
day
then
every
day
then
regularly
to
catch
each
outgoing
mail
in
the
whole
of
england
she
knew
nobody
in
her
anger
against
british
justice
she
wished
to
know
nobody
she
was
inconsolable
bruised
in
spirit
and
crushed
in
her
pride
after
the
pomp
and
hubbub
of
the
east
she
found
london
drab
and
melancholy
from
her
lodgings
in
kensington
she
poured
out
her
soul
on
paper
much
of
what
she
wrote
consisted
of
memories
the
tender
trifles
which
a
mother
treasures
about
her
child
almost
imperceptibly
there
came
a
change
a
querulous
note
crept
in
a
questioning
of
motives
why
had
i
sent
her
as
far
away
as
england
why
had
i
sent
her
away
at
all
if
it
were
true
that
it
was
not
i
who
had
exiled
her
why
had
i
not
accompanied
her
was
it
because
i
was
tired
and
ashamed
of
her
it
would
have
been
kinder
to
have
left
her
to
dance
in
the
temple
then
a
new
suspicion
grew
up
which
betrayed
an
evil
that
i
had
never
traced
in
her
with
whom
was
i
living
some
white
woman
was
that
why
i
had
rid
myself
of
her
answers
could
i
make
it
was
like
arguing
with
a
spiteful
child
our
misunderstandings
were
as
wide
as
the
distance
that
separated
us
she
implored
and
finally
demanded
that
i
should
join
her
the
more
i
stated
obstacles
the
more
convinced
she
became
that
i
was
cruel
like
all
the
sahibs
who
were
torturing
her
the
proud
sahibs
who
thought
nothing
of
a
murdered
baby
when
it
was
only
the
child
of
a
woman
then
on
her
heart
hardened
till
at
last
i
failed
to
recognize
in
her
any
resemblance
to
the
gentle
wife
who
had
been
so
much
my
companion
she
wrote
vaguely
about
revenge
a
revenge
that
should
embrace
the
whole
white
race
contempt
should
be
repaid
with
despising
hatred
with
blows
blood
with
blood
her
beauty
should
be
the
weapon
she
seemed
to
have
gone
mad
suddenly
her
letters
ceased
my
remittances
were
returned
they
had
failed
to
reach
her
what
follows
i
have
but
one
explanation
by
some
species
of
unconscious
hypnotism
so
long
as
i
had
exerted
physical
influence
over
her
i
had
had
the
power
to
make
the
european
in
her
predominate
as
my
influence
weakened
with
time
and
distance
she
relapsed
into
the
woman
she
always
would
have
been
if
i
had
not
found
her
a
smiling
menace
to
the
nobilities
of
both
the
races
from
which
she
was
descended
a
human
jackal
following
the
hunt
that
sounds
harsh
then
listen
to
the
conclusion
of
my
story
day
six
months
after
i
had
lost
touch
with
her
i
was
glancing
through
an
illustrated
weekly
when
on
turning
a
page
i
found
her
portrait
gazing
up
at
me
she
was
photographed
in
almost
the
attitude
and
attire
in
which
i
had
first
caught
sight
of
her
in
the
temple
the
very
setting
was
similar
behind
her
the
huge
god
squatted
gloating
and
sinister
on
her
face
was
the
unchanging
houri
smile
on
reading
the
text
i
discovered
that
she
had
leaped
into
instant
fame
as
an
exponent
of
indian
dancing
you
will
remember
that
in
the
last
two
years
before
the
war
the
dance
craze
was
at
its
height
she
had
been
acclaimed
a
great
artist
everything
she
said
did
and
wore
was
fulsomely
praised
and
described
there
was
no
false
reticence
about
either
her
or
her
admirers
she
was
frankly
advertised
as
being
possessed
of
the
most
beautiful
body
in
europe
she
had
given
herself
a
french
name
and
was
announced
as
being
of
french
ancestry
according
to
her
printed
biography
her
father
had
been
an
who
had
taken
her
with
him
on
all
his
expeditions
on
his
last
in
india
he
had
died
she
had
been
kidnaped
for
her
beauty
and
sold
into
the
service
of
a
hindoo
temple
from
this
bondage
she
had
been
rescued
by
an
englishman
of
title
who
had
chivalrously
restored
her
to
her
family
in
marseilles
there
was
much
more
to
the
same
effect
a
jumble
of
perverted
truth
and
romantic
lies
precisely
the
kind
of
adventurous
nonsense
which
appeals
to
the
public
then
on
the
press
i
was
always
getting
news
of
her
london
paris
berlin
petersburg
each
in
turn
went
mad
over
her
she
captivated
a
continent
kings
and
emperors
commanded
her
to
appear
before
them
her
tours
were
royal
triumphs
little
by
little
ugly
rumors
began
to
spread
there
was
a
parisian
banker
who
when
he
had
lavished
his
all
upon
her
committed
suicide
leaving
his
wife
and
children
penniless
there
was
another
scandal
it
had
to
do
with
a
russian
general
who
had
betrayed
his
country
at
his
he
poisoned
himself
when
her
name
was
introduced
into
the
evidence
as
though
a
conspiracy
of
silence
had
broken
down
now
that
she
began
to
be
gossiped
about
scandals
gathered
thick
and
fast
each
new
one
was
more
infamous
than
the
last
out
of
each
she
emerged
unpitying
and
smiling
it
was
only
her
victims
who
suffered
her
progress
was
marked
by
a
trail
of
death
and
ruin
nevertheless
infatuated
by
the
exquisiteness
of
her
body
men
fluttered
about
her
unceasingly
like
moths
shriveling
their
souls
in
the
flame
of
her
fascination
when
the
peace
of
the
world
was
violated
by
the
germans
hindwood
leaned
forward
tapping
the
major
knee
can
spare
you
your
eloquence
the
rest
of
your
story
is
common
property
the
woman
you
describe
stole
the
allies
defense
plans
from
her
lover
he
was
a
british
naval
officer
temporarily
in
paris
she
was
caught
there
was
a
sentimental
agitation
in
her
favor
an
attempt
to
argue
that
as
a
physical
masterpiece
of
feminine
perfection
she
ought
to
be
exempted
it
accomplished
nothing
she
was
a
german
spy
who
had
sold
men
lives
for
profit
she
received
and
deserved
no
more
mercy
than
a
after
having
been
encouraged
in
her
sins
because
of
her
unrivaled
loveliness
she
was
led
out
at
dawn
in
the
woods
of
vincennes
where
the
body
which
had
maddened
thousands
of
eyes
was
riddled
with
the
major
lips
were
smiling
crookedly
could
she
have
been
riddled
with
bullets
he
questioned
you
crossed
the
atlantic
in
her
company
hindwood
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
insist
on
propounding
conundrums
it
up
to
you
to
supply
the
can
supply
them
the
person
executed
in
the
woods
of
vincennes
was
not
a
a
daring
assertion
who
was
it
distinguished
french
officer
a
man
who
had
been
crippled
in
defending
his
country
and
held
the
highest
awards
for
gallantry
in
days
he
had
been
an
old
flame
of
hers
whom
she
had
abandoned
with
more
than
her
ordinary
callousness
on
hearing
of
her
predicament
he
begged
to
be
allotted
the
duty
of
seeing
that
her
sentence
was
properly
executed
the
reason
he
gave
was
that
he
might
clear
himself
of
the
taint
of
ever
having
associated
with
a
traitress
he
was
put
in
charge
of
the
guard
on
her
last
night
making
use
of
his
opportunity
he
exchanged
clothing
with
her
and
hindwood
stifled
a
yawn
expect
me
to
believe
this
the
major
mastered
his
anger
expect
you
to
believe
nothing
i
here
to
state
facts
and
to
warn
you
that
your
friend
who
now
calls
herself
santa
gorlof
is
the
same
woman
my
appeal
to
you
for
assistance
in
bringing
her
to
justice
is
both
personal
and
patriotic
i
am
her
husband
my
honor
is
involved
i
am
also
an
englishman
all
her
intrigues
even
this
last
in
which
prince
rogovich
met
his
fate
are
aimed
against
the
friends
of
england
one
of
whom
i
may
remind
you
is
your
own
great
nation
all
i
can
say
is
that
each
man
has
his
separate
standard
of
loyalty
for
me
an
old
soldier
my
devotion
to
my
country
is
more
important
than
my
compassion
for
an
erring
hindwood
rose
uncomfortably
against
his
will
he
had
been
impressed
by
the
stoical
dignity
of
his
persistent
guest
deserve
that
i
should
be
frank
with
you
here
the
truth
i
accept
very
little
of
what
told
me
either
you
mistaken
my
traveling
companion
for
another
woman
or
else
you
been
trying
to
prejudice
me
with
a
fantastic
story
but
even
though
i
accepted
your
supposed
revelation
i
should
refuse
to
help
you
on
your
own
showing
you
endeavoring
to
bring
the
mother
of
your
child
to
the
scaffold
i
should
respect
you
more
if
you
left
her
fate
to
other
hands
disbelieving
you
as
i
do
i
regard
the
introduction
of
miss
gorlof
name
into
the
discussion
as
rank
impertinence
your
coupling
of
my
name
with
hers
increases
the
cowardice
of
your
discourtesy
if
you
had
convinced
me
and
i
were
eager
to
assist
you
i
could
i
know
nothing
about
her
our
acquaintance
was
the
most
casual
in
all
probability
i
seen
her
for
the
last
time
i
the
vaguest
notion
where
she
to
be
found
if
your
vampire
actually
escaped
the
bullets
in
the
woods
of
vincennes
i
advise
you
to
search
for
her
in
another
direction
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
that
if
santa
gorlof
learns
of
your
activities
you
find
yourself
in
trouble
i
reckon
myself
some
judge
when
it
comes
to
the
major
drew
out
his
silk
handkerchief
from
his
breast
pocket
and
flicked
a
speck
of
dust
from
his
immaculate
white
spats
with
the
utmost
deliberation
he
recovered
his
hat
and
gloves
for
a
few
seconds
he
gazed
out
of
the
window
thoughtfully
then
turning
slowly
he
crossed
the
room
with
his
hand
on
the
door
knob
he
glanced
back
solemnly
he
passed
his
fingers
across
his
lips
and
cleared
his
throat
she
has
added
you
to
her
list
of
victims
if
she
gives
you
time
before
she
kills
you
remember
that
i
warned
when
hindwood
had
recovered
sufficiently
from
his
surprise
to
follow
him
out
into
the
passage
every
sign
of
his
unwelcome
visitor
had
vanished
he
had
scarcely
closed
the
door
and
reseated
himself
when
again
there
came
a
tapping
chapter
the
third
he
plunges
into
romance
i
hindwood
consulted
his
watch
the
hour
was
nearing
midnight
he
was
surprised
to
discover
how
the
time
had
flown
the
tapping
outside
his
door
continued
there
was
nothing
hurried
about
it
nothing
impatient
on
the
other
hand
there
was
nothing
humble
it
was
a
secret
intimate
kind
of
tapping
like
the
signaling
of
a
woman
to
her
lover
it
would
cease
for
a
minute
so
that
he
began
to
hope
that
he
was
to
be
left
in
quiet
then
it
would
recommence
he
sat
obstinately
at
bay
almost
holding
his
breath
not
daring
to
move
lest
he
should
betray
that
he
had
noticed
he
was
determined
not
to
admit
this
new
disturber
he
had
had
enough
of
danger
warnings
and
revengeful
husbands
the
only
danger
that
he
greatly
dreaded
was
the
loss
of
a
second
night
rest
the
sound
was
getting
on
his
nerves
it
was
so
irritatingly
discreet
and
importunate
at
first
he
had
tried
to
believe
that
his
caller
was
a
hotel
employee
but
a
servant
would
have
taken
silence
for
an
answer
a
good
five
minutes
ago
if
it
had
been
any
one
who
had
a
right
to
be
there
the
tapping
would
have
been
bolder
whoever
it
was
it
was
some
one
who
had
correctly
estimated
his
mood
an
interval
and
then
getting
stealthily
to
his
feet
he
tiptoed
to
the
threshold
and
flung
wide
the
door
beg
your
he
caught
her
arm
as
she
stumbled
back
guess
i
startled
she
pressed
a
finger
to
her
lips
me
inside
so
that
i
can
sit
giving
her
his
arm
he
led
her
to
a
chair
having
returned
and
closed
the
door
he
surveyed
her
at
his
leisure
she
had
the
appearance
of
a
peasant
woman
dressed
in
her
sunday
best
yet
so
great
was
her
dignity
she
did
not
seem
out
of
place
in
her
surroundings
she
was
very
aged
her
figure
was
shapeless
and
bowed
her
gray
hair
was
cropped
like
a
boy
she
wore
spread
over
it
knotted
at
the
throat
a
neatly
folded
kerchief
of
white
linen
she
was
clad
in
a
black
gown
of
the
utmost
plainness
nothing
distracted
attention
from
her
face
which
was
as
stoical
with
endurance
as
a
gladiator
you
could
almost
trace
the
riverbeds
her
tears
had
worn
the
fist
of
fate
had
punched
it
flat
it
was
a
ruin
to
which
violence
had
done
its
worst
but
had
failed
to
destroy
its
gentleness
and
he
had
expected
santa
instead
of
feminine
frailty
spurring
weak
desires
there
had
come
this
woman
iron
of
will
broken
in
body
ravished
by
years
with
her
tremendous
impression
of
moral
strength
as
she
sat
before
him
her
gnarled
hands
resting
on
her
cane
pushing
back
the
weight
of
her
ancient
shoulders
she
raised
to
him
the
dim
valiance
of
her
eyes
can
i
do
for
you
he
questioned
she
swung
her
head
from
side
to
side
with
the
brooding
fierceness
of
a
decrepit
lioness
is
you
whom
i
have
come
to
he
smiled
think
you
are
am
never
she
gazed
at
him
intently
have
come
to
help
you
to
act
generously
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
save
a
woman
perhaps
at
the
sacrifice
of
he
laughed
quietly
mean
santa
gorlof
i
wonder
when
i
to
hear
the
last
of
her
a
secret
service
man
has
spent
the
past
two
hours
instructing
me
what
i
can
do
for
her
you
must
have
met
him
he
had
scarcely
left
when
you
began
to
tap
he
tried
to
convince
me
that
if
i
did
protect
myself
by
giving
him
information
which
would
lead
to
her
arrest
my
name
would
be
added
to
her
list
of
victims
a
pleasant
sort
of
threat
i
afraid
he
found
me
as
you
will
probably
find
me
disappointing
i
not
possessed
of
any
incriminating
information
and
i
do
place
any
faith
in
her
list
of
victims
she
struck
me
as
being
a
very
gracious
and
fascinating
woman
beyond
that
i
have
no
opinion
about
her
either
for
or
the
old
head
sank
further
forward
the
dim
eyes
became
searching
you
told
him
nothing
knew
nothing
to
there
followed
a
deep
silence
during
which
they
gazed
fixedly
at
each
other
she
sighed
contentedly
nodding
her
approval
you
are
in
love
with
her
that
makes
things
easier
even
to
me
you
lie
to
me
who
am
her
friend
deny
that
i
am
in
love
with
her
but
what
makes
you
think
so
thinks
you
come
directly
from
her
he
had
been
unable
to
keep
back
the
eagerness
from
his
voice
instantly
he
realized
his
indiscretion
pulling
up
a
chair
he
seated
himself
opposite
her
that
he
might
lose
nothing
of
her
changes
of
expression
the
second
unconventional
visitor
he
said
i
received
this
evening
the
object
of
both
your
visits
seems
to
be
the
same
to
associate
my
name
with
that
of
a
lady
to
whom
i
am
comparatively
a
stranger
we
may
have
conversed
together
a
couple
of
dozen
times
when
we
parted
i
never
expected
to
hear
from
her
within
the
space
of
hours
a
man
who
claims
to
be
her
husband
comes
to
me
accusing
her
of
every
infamy
no
sooner
has
the
door
closed
behind
him
than
you
enter
asserting
that
i
am
in
love
with
her
you
must
pardon
me
if
i
begin
to
suspect
a
plot
for
all
i
know
you
may
be
my
first
visitor
accomplice
employing
a
more
disarming
method
to
get
me
to
commit
myself
you
tell
me
you
are
santa
gorlof
friend
you
might
equally
well
say
you
are
her
grandmother
you
offer
me
no
proof
if
she
really
in
trouble
i
sorry
but
i
fail
to
see
any
way
in
which
i
can
serve
there
were
no
way
i
should
not
have
troubled
you
especially
at
this
late
hour
as
for
her
being
in
danger
she
has
always
been
in
danger
she
was
born
into
the
world
like
that
i
am
old
very
old
i
have
no
traces
of
it
left
but
i
too
was
once
the
trembling
hands
fumbled
at
the
white
linen
kerchief
loosening
the
knot
against
her
neck
yes
i
was
beautiful
but
i
did
not
come
to
you
to
speak
of
that
my
friend
you
are
good
i
saw
that
the
moment
i
entered
i
said
to
myself
is
the
man
who
could
understand
our
santa
and
make
her
honorable
like
himself
the
world
has
given
her
no
chance
no
never
the
husband
who
should
have
cared
for
her
tossed
her
aside
like
an
old
shoe
when
like
all
animals
robbed
of
their
young
she
struck
out
in
i
see
you
have
heard
that
how
her
child
was
murdered
and
she
was
sent
into
exile
for
taking
justice
into
her
own
hands
doubtless
you
have
heard
much
else
she
is
a
woman
who
would
have
done
no
harm
to
any
one
if
she
had
been
allowed
to
remain
a
mother
but
because
they
scoffed
at
her
motherhood
all
her
goodness
has
turned
to
wickedness
using
her
body
as
a
decoy
she
has
slain
men
of
the
race
that
persecuted
her
because
she
could
not
get
her
child
back
she
has
become
an
outlaw
making
society
pay
for
her
she
paused
watching
her
effect
hindwood
had
not
removed
his
eyes
from
hers
his
face
was
troubled
do
think
you
know
what
has
been
told
me
the
man
who
introduced
himself
to
me
as
her
husband
said
that
she
was
a
a
temple
who
to
revenge
herself
had
poisoned
white
men
happiness
and
during
the
war
had
become
an
international
spy
working
against
the
allies
he
made
the
assertion
that
she
was
responsible
for
the
vanishing
of
prince
rogovich
if
these
things
are
so
how
can
i
a
decent
man
bending
forward
the
old
lady
clutched
his
hand
was
decent
men
who
made
her
what
she
is
he
released
his
hand
quietly
have
not
denied
any
of
the
accusations
which
are
brought
against
her
and
yet
remembering
her
face
i
can
not
believe
that
she
is
bad
you
want
me
to
save
her
if
by
that
you
mean
that
you
want
me
to
pledge
myself
not
to
give
evidence
against
her
you
may
tell
her
from
me
that
i
have
no
do
mean
what
want
you
to
declare
to
me
that
you
love
her
no
listen
there
is
still
something
in
her
that
is
pure
you
have
made
her
conscious
of
it
you
can
undo
the
wrong
that
has
been
done
her
and
make
her
the
woman
she
should
be
if
you
hindwood
rose
from
his
seat
and
paced
the
room
suddenly
he
halted
and
swung
round
did
you
know
that
i
desired
her
until
you
came
i
scarcely
realized
it
myself
why
should
you
have
appointed
yourself
to
tempt
me
you
who
are
so
old
between
sane
people
what
would
be
the
use
of
my
telling
you
that
i
loved
her
though
i
refused
to
believe
any
of
the
libels
against
her
which
even
you
seem
to
credit
there
are
two
facts
which
it
does
not
seem
possible
to
escape
that
she
is
married
and
that
the
police
are
on
her
track
i
have
been
warned
that
when
she
traps
men
she
commences
by
appealing
to
their
chivalry
that
happening
now
do
you
see
where
you
place
me
if
she
is
falsely
accused
i
brand
myself
a
coward
by
running
away
from
her
if
she
is
guilty
i
endanger
my
good
name
by
having
any
more
to
do
with
her
what
i
am
waiting
to
hear
you
say
is
that
this
is
a
case
of
mistaken
identity
that
she
is
willing
and
able
to
prove
you
help
me
out
of
my
chair
when
she
was
on
her
feet
she
let
go
his
arm
and
commenced
to
move
across
the
room
are
you
going
give
her
your
told
you
told
me
that
you
love
she
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
with
quiet
decision
he
put
his
back
against
the
door
preventing
her
from
opening
it
he
said
as
you
are
you
owe
me
some
consideration
before
you
go
i
at
least
have
a
right
to
ask
your
she
smiled
wistfully
the
harshness
in
her
face
was
replaced
by
a
glow
of
tenderness
you
have
the
right
i
am
called
little
grandmother
i
am
a
readjuster
of
destinies
the
champion
of
the
i
fight
for
those
for
whom
the
world
has
ceased
to
what
have
you
to
do
with
santa
has
been
because
she
has
been
oppressed
you
overlook
any
crimes
she
may
have
committed
am
not
god
that
i
should
judge
if
people
hearts
are
empty
i
reckon
them
my
me
ask
you
one
more
question
did
santa
tell
you
that
she
loved
me
the
old
head
shook
sorrowfully
act
nobly
it
is
not
necessary
to
be
loved
in
return
let
me
go
do
not
try
to
follow
standing
aside
he
opened
the
door
we
meet
again
as
she
hobbled
out
she
glanced
across
her
shoulder
in
her
gesture
there
was
the
ghostly
grace
of
the
proud
coquette
who
was
vanishing
and
forgotten
you
want
to
she
whispered
ii
now
that
she
was
gone
he
realized
that
under
the
hypnotic
influence
of
her
presence
he
had
revealed
far
more
than
he
had
intended
he
should
never
have
allowed
her
to
escape
him
he
should
have
insisted
on
accompanying
her
she
had
afforded
him
his
only
clue
to
whereabouts
at
all
costs
he
must
see
santa
his
peace
of
mind
depended
on
it
the
thought
of
her
would
haunt
him
he
would
never
rest
until
he
had
arrived
at
the
truth
probably
until
he
had
seen
her
he
would
never
be
free
from
the
intrusions
of
anonymous
intriguers
he
dodged
the
theory
of
her
guilt
preferring
to
persuade
himself
that
a
conspiracy
was
afoot
the
object
of
which
might
be
blackmail
more
likely
it
was
a
clever
move
on
the
part
of
financial
rivals
to
thwart
his
plans
by
discrediting
him
if
he
could
meet
santa
he
would
know
for
certain
whether
she
was
a
decoy
or
a
whatever
his
intellect
might
suspect
his
heart
resolutely
acquitted
her
it
was
too
late
to
overtake
the
little
grandmother
but
he
was
determined
to
do
his
best
to
trace
her
in
the
passage
he
discovered
a
solitary
individual
collecting
boots
and
shoes
which
had
been
placed
for
cleaning
outside
the
neighboring
doors
old
lady
left
my
room
a
few
moments
ago
she
had
short
hair
and
a
white
handkerchief
tied
over
her
head
no
doubt
you
saw
the
man
rose
from
his
stooping
posture
old
lady
with
short
hair
you
say
she
had
a
handkerchief
tied
over
it
it
does
sound
like
the
ritz
no
i
did
not
see
of
the
man
at
the
elevator
he
made
the
same
inquiry
only
to
be
informed
that
several
old
ladies
had
been
carried
up
and
down
descending
to
the
foyer
he
presented
himself
at
the
desk
it
your
rule
to
have
all
callers
announced
before
they
shown
in
on
your
guests
how
did
it
happen
that
an
old
lady
a
rather
curious
old
lady
with
short
hair
and
a
white
handkerchief
over
her
head
like
a
shawl
was
allowed
to
find
her
way
into
my
room
you
give
me
the
particulars
i
have
the
staff
on
duty
as
he
turned
away
he
threw
back
across
his
shoulder
sha
be
going
to
bed
yet
if
you
discover
anything
you
might
report
half
an
hour
later
he
was
summoned
to
the
telephone
your
visitor
sir
no
one
saw
far
into
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
he
sat
cogitating
what
steps
ought
he
to
take
to
protect
himself
he
could
place
his
case
in
the
hands
of
the
police
but
if
he
did
he
might
stir
up
a
hornet
nest
most
certainly
he
would
be
compelled
to
postpone
his
business
on
the
continent
and
to
prolong
his
stay
in
england
but
more
disastrous
than
personal
inconvenience
in
going
to
the
police
he
might
be
the
means
of
putting
santa
enemies
on
her
track
they
would
expect
him
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
everything
he
would
find
difficulty
in
inventing
convincing
motives
to
explain
the
shiftiness
of
his
conduct
since
landing
if
he
could
speak
to
santa
he
would
know
how
to
act
if
she
were
really
implicated
in
the
rogovich
affair
his
best
way
of
helping
her
would
be
to
clear
out
of
england
but
if
she
could
assure
him
of
her
innocence
he
was
prepared
to
stay
and
back
her
to
the
limit
of
his
capacity
across
the
sky
the
silver
moon
drifted
like
a
a
parable
of
santa
moving
immaculately
among
rumors
of
darkest
misdoings
whatever
she
had
done
had
not
quenched
her
purity
if
she
had
done
the
worst
of
which
she
was
accused
her
perverted
still
clothed
her
with
the
tatters
of
a
tragic
goodness
he
jerked
himself
irritably
back
to
reality
how
could
a
woman
who
had
spread
death
with
her
beauty
still
retain
her
purity
he
had
been
warned
that
she
trapped
men
by
appealing
not
to
their
baseness
but
to
their
chivalry
what
feat
of
chivalry
was
this
that
he
was
performing
it
was
best
to
dispense
with
casuistry
the
accumulated
slanders
to
which
he
had
listened
had
spurred
his
curiosity
they
had
changed
a
modishly
attractive
woman
into
a
romantic
figure
a
figure
which
if
it
were
not
noble
at
least
possessed
the
virtue
of
lonely
courage
he
would
allow
himself
four
days
in
england
if
he
had
not
heard
from
her
by
then
he
would
go
about
his
business
having
to
this
extent
set
a
limit
to
his
difficulties
he
took
himself
off
to
bed
iii
his
first
anxiety
next
morning
was
to
scan
the
papers
he
had
all
the
london
dailies
brought
to
him
and
read
them
before
he
dressed
for
the
most
part
they
told
him
nothing
new
merely
recording
with
varying
degrees
of
sensationalism
the
indisputable
fact
that
prince
rogovich
had
vanished
one
or
two
hinted
at
foul
play
several
suggested
accidental
drowning
the
bulk
of
them
and
among
these
were
the
most
reputable
presumed
that
the
prince
had
had
private
reasons
for
avoiding
england
and
landing
at
a
continental
port
santa
name
was
not
mentioned
he
found
nothing
to
confirm
the
warnings
of
last
night
or
to
alarm
himself
on
her
account
it
was
later
while
eating
breakfast
with
the
propped
up
before
him
that
he
came
across
an
item
which
set
him
viewing
what
had
happened
from
a
new
angle
he
was
skipping
through
a
sketch
of
the
career
when
he
stumbled
on
the
following
paragraph
will
be
remembered
how
last
summer
the
polish
women
sense
of
injustice
concentrated
in
a
silent
protest
for
an
entire
week
day
and
night
never
less
than
a
thousand
mothers
each
carrying
a
dead
child
in
her
breast
camped
about
the
rogovich
palace
in
glancing
back
he
read
more
carefully
the
information
which
led
up
to
the
paragraph
the
two
years
following
the
close
of
the
war
poland
together
with
most
of
central
europe
has
suffered
intensely
from
famine
children
have
contributed
by
far
the
largest
proportion
to
the
toll
of
death
for
much
of
this
so
far
as
poland
is
concerned
prince
rogovich
has
been
held
accountable
the
national
wealth
which
he
has
squandered
on
equipping
armies
might
have
been
spent
more
profitably
in
purchasing
foodstuffs
the
trip
to
america
from
which
he
was
returning
at
the
time
of
his
mysterious
disappearance
is
said
to
have
had
as
its
object
the
floating
of
a
loan
which
would
enable
his
generals
to
maintain
their
offensives
for
at
least
another
twelve
months
while
the
party
in
poland
supported
by
french
diplomacy
backed
him
up
his
imperialistic
policies
were
bitterly
condemned
by
polish
mothers
who
had
to
watch
their
children
perishing
from
starvation
in
order
that
frontiers
might
be
extended
already
the
was
so
high
that
it
was
impossible
to
supply
sufficient
coffins
at
the
main
streets
of
warsaw
were
jammed
with
funerals
many
of
these
funerals
consisted
of
only
two
persons
a
man
and
woman
themselves
weak
from
want
of
nourishment
staggering
under
the
puny
load
of
a
bundle
wrapped
in
paper
containing
the
body
of
the
latest
son
or
daughter
to
die
of
then
followed
the
brief
description
of
how
the
thousand
polish
mothers
had
camped
for
a
week
in
protest
about
the
prince
palace
hindwood
looked
up
from
his
paper
gazing
across
the
flashing
gulf
of
sunlight
to
where
the
azure
sea
of
distant
sky
beat
against
the
embattled
strand
of
housetops
if
santa
had
pushed
the
prince
overboard
had
that
been
her
motive
that
polish
children
might
no
longer
die
of
hunger
perhaps
always
if
indeed
she
had
killed
men
her
purpose
had
been
to
act
as
the
scourge
of
the
enemies
of
children
the
memory
of
her
own
dead
child
had
urged
her
mistakenly
but
none
the
less
valiantly
she
had
constituted
herself
the
avenger
of
all
mothers
who
had
been
despoiled
by
masculine
callousness
what
journeys
he
was
willing
to
undertake
if
only
he
might
excuse
her
even
though
he
were
compelled
to
admit
her
guilt
he
was
determined
to
adjudge
her
magnanimous
at
any
rate
she
had
not
been
apprehended
with
a
lighter
heart
than
he
had
experienced
for
some
hours
he
dismissed
her
from
his
thoughts
and
set
out
to
fulfill
his
round
of
engagements
it
was
three
when
he
returned
immediately
on
entering
his
room
he
noticed
that
a
sheet
of
had
been
pinned
conspicuously
to
the
pillow
of
his
bed
its
evident
purpose
was
to
attract
his
attention
on
approaching
it
he
saw
that
the
message
which
it
contained
was
printed
in
large
letters
and
unsigned
it
read
you
wish
to
see
her
follow
but
do
not
speak
to
the
it
did
make
sense
what
widow
the
whom
he
could
see
by
following
the
widow
referred
presumably
to
santa
but
who
had
pinned
the
sheet
of
paper
to
his
pillow
how
had
this
person
gained
access
to
his
rooms
that
morning
when
he
went
out
he
had
locked
his
door
and
left
his
key
at
the
hotel
desk
he
had
in
his
possession
confidential
papers
of
almost
state
importance
if
their
secrets
were
shared
he
might
just
as
well
pack
up
and
return
to
america
his
sense
that
he
was
the
of
a
conspiracy
strengthened
seizing
his
hat
and
gloves
he
hurried
he
had
just
time
to
lodge
a
complaint
with
the
management
before
keeping
his
next
appointment
he
had
alighted
from
the
elevator
and
was
about
to
cross
the
foyer
when
a
woman
rose
from
a
chair
near
by
and
passed
immediately
in
front
of
him
he
jerked
himself
up
with
a
murmured
apology
then
noticed
that
she
was
gowned
in
the
heaviest
widow
mourning
a
coincidence
he
thought
and
yet
not
so
very
extraordinary
he
was
proceeding
on
his
journey
when
his
eyes
chanced
to
follow
her
she
had
halted
uncertainly
as
though
she
had
forgotten
something
by
the
poise
of
her
head
he
guessed
that
behind
her
veil
she
was
gazing
at
him
more
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
than
as
the
preface
to
an
adventure
he
also
halted
somewhat
ostentatiously
he
drew
from
his
pocket
the
sheet
of
which
he
had
found
pinned
to
his
pillow
unfolding
it
he
reread
its
printed
message
you
wish
to
see
her
follow
but
do
not
speak
to
the
he
looked
up
slowly
almost
imperceptibly
the
veiled
figure
nodded
he
made
a
step
as
if
to
approach
her
instantly
she
turned
and
passed
out
without
further
consideration
in
his
eagerness
to
see
what
she
would
do
next
he
followed
iv
he
had
expected
that
outside
the
hotel
in
the
throng
of
anonymous
traffic
she
would
wait
for
him
without
giving
any
further
sign
that
she
was
aware
of
him
she
moved
quietly
through
the
fashionable
crowd
of
piccadilly
and
turned
into
the
sunlit
leisure
of
james
street
the
unconscious
gaiety
of
her
way
of
walking
was
strangely
out
of
keeping
with
her
garments
of
bereavement
hindwood
curiosity
was
piqued
in
a
shamefaced
way
he
was
overwhelmingly
interested
he
felt
himself
capable
of
a
great
romance
for
the
moment
he
was
almost
grateful
for
the
annoyances
that
had
presented
him
with
so
thrilling
an
opportunity
what
was
he
meant
to
do
the
message
had
forbidden
him
to
accost
her
he
had
been
ordered
merely
to
follow
how
long
and
whither
at
the
foreign
office
a
high
official
was
waiting
for
him
expecting
every
minute
to
hear
him
announced
to
wander
through
london
after
an
unknown
woman
was
the
trick
of
a
gallant
or
a
moonstruck
boy
he
was
neither
he
was
a
man
of
discretion
who
aimed
at
becoming
the
advisor
of
statesmen
and
yet
his
conduct
was
open
to
every
misinterpretation
he
began
to
feel
himself
a
scoundrel
for
a
man
whose
emotions
had
always
been
shepherded
the
sensation
was
exciting
and
not
wholly
unpleasant
if
he
could
only
learn
something
about
her
crossing
to
the
opposite
pavement
he
hurried
his
pace
till
he
was
abreast
of
her
she
was
young
her
figure
was
slight
and
upright
she
was
about
the
same
build
as
santa
but
seemed
taller
if
she
were
indeed
santa
this
impression
of
added
height
might
be
due
to
the
somberness
of
her
attire
she
was
so
carefully
veiled
that
even
her
hair
was
hidden
there
was
no
feature
by
which
he
could
identify
her
he
tried
another
experiment
recrossing
the
street
to
a
point
some
distance
ahead
he
loitered
before
a
shop
making
a
pretense
of
studying
its
wares
he
heard
the
rustle
of
her
crêpe
as
she
drew
near
him
she
went
by
him
so
closely
that
she
almost
touched
him
he
was
conscious
of
the
faint
fragrance
of
her
perfume
in
the
window
he
caught
the
dim
reflection
of
her
figure
at
the
moment
that
she
was
immediately
behind
him
she
moved
her
head
in
a
backward
gesture
seeming
to
indicate
that
he
should
follow
when
he
turned
to
obey
she
was
drifting
through
the
september
sunshine
completely
and
unnoticing
traveling
the
yard
of
james
palace
she
entered
the
mall
there
she
hesitated
giving
him
time
to
catch
up
with
her
a
taxi
was
crawling
by
she
hailed
it
addressing
the
driver
but
glancing
directly
at
himself
she
said
in
a
sweet
distinct
voice
station
the
brighton
v
was
she
santa
the
voice
had
sounded
different
yet
had
his
life
depended
on
it
he
could
not
have
decided
there
was
only
one
way
of
finding
out
by
joining
her
on
the
brighton
platform
this
would
mean
missing
his
appointment
at
the
foreign
office
he
was
prepared
to
make
the
sacrifice
but
he
had
no
guarantee
that
the
chase
would
end
there
it
was
possible
that
she
would
still
refuse
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
and
compel
him
to
accompany
her
further
his
rôle
was
that
of
the
incautious
fly
but
who
was
the
of
this
web
in
which
it
was
intended
that
he
should
become
entangled
was
it
the
little
grandmother
he
had
asked
her
whether
they
would
meet
again
in
the
light
of
present
happenings
her
answer
took
on
a
sinister
meaning
you
want
to
as
he
stood
there
in
the
sunshine
of
the
mall
with
the
thud
of
fashionable
equipages
flashing
by
a
sullen
conviction
grew
up
within
him
that
he
was
becoming
afraid
an
empty
taxi
hove
in
sight
he
beckoned
before
it
had
halted
he
was
standing
on
the
victoria
station
the
brighton
the
driver
took
his
brevity
for
a
sign
that
a
train
was
to
be
caught
by
the
narrowest
of
margins
he
made
such
speed
that
they
drew
up
against
the
curb
just
as
the
widow
vehicle
was
departing
she
threw
him
a
furtive
glance
from
behind
her
veil
then
turned
and
moved
away
as
though
he
were
the
completest
stranger
imitating
her
discretion
he
followed
at
a
distance
halting
before
the
she
produced
her
purse
he
edged
nearer
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
learn
her
destination
single
to
seafold
he
heard
her
say
when
his
turn
came
he
repeated
her
words
adding
long
before
it
starts
minutes
the
clerk
told
him
as
he
gathered
up
his
change
he
was
surprised
to
observe
how
little
was
left
out
of
his
pound
he
had
supposed
seafold
would
prove
to
be
a
suburb
by
the
cost
of
his
ticket
he
estimated
that
it
must
be
a
journey
of
at
least
sixty
miles
was
it
worth
the
taking
could
he
return
that
same
evening
he
might
get
stranded
if
that
happened
he
was
unprepared
to
spend
the
night
these
considerations
were
swept
aside
when
he
noticed
that
the
widow
had
once
more
vanished
accosting
a
porter
seafold
platform
he
asked
breathlessly
as
the
one
for
tells
me
nothing
there
no
luggage
show
before
he
had
passed
the
barrier
he
was
aware
that
the
train
was
crowded
in
compartments
passengers
were
standing
to
discover
any
one
under
these
circumstances
would
be
a
labor
of
patience
were
being
banged
and
locked
even
at
this
final
moment
his
habitual
caution
reasserted
itself
what
else
but
folly
could
result
from
an
adventure
so
recklessly
undertaken
the
porter
caught
him
by
the
arm
you
are
mister
in
no
sooner
had
he
squeezed
himself
into
the
remaining
seat
than
with
a
groaning
jerk
the
train
started
vi
lucky
the
luckiest
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
him
would
have
been
to
be
left
behind
here
he
was
following
a
woman
whose
face
he
had
not
seen
to
a
place
which
up
to
a
few
moments
ago
he
had
not
known
existed
even
to
believe
that
he
was
following
her
required
optimism
he
had
no
proof
that
she
was
on
the
train
probably
it
had
been
part
of
her
strategy
to
send
him
scurrying
on
this
fool
errand
in
order
that
her
accomplices
might
be
undisturbed
while
they
ransacked
his
rooms
in
his
absence
make
an
end
of
this
nonsense
he
told
himself
alighting
at
the
next
but
where
was
the
next
he
glanced
along
the
double
row
of
his
barricaded
behind
their
papers
he
wanted
to
ask
his
question
and
watched
for
an
opportunity
at
last
losing
patience
he
nudged
the
man
beside
him
me
sir
i
a
stranger
i
made
a
mistake
my
ticket
to
seafold
wherever
that
may
be
and
i
with
his
nose
still
glued
to
the
page
the
man
muttered
all
right
you
do
need
to
worry
it
where
you
it
is
all
right
hindwood
contradicted
with
a
shade
of
annoyance
do
want
to
go
to
seafold
i
want
to
return
to
london
what
i
trying
to
ask
you
is
where
can
i
get
out
if
you
think
it
worth
should
i
think
it
worth
while
the
paper
rustled
testily
and
was
raised
a
few
inches
higher
lewes
is
almost
at
seafold
it
the
junction
where
you
change
the
one
and
only
stop
between
here
and
turning
away
disgustedly
he
watched
the
swiftly
changing
landscape
everything
that
met
his
eyes
was
beautiful
with
a
domestic
underlying
tenderness
it
had
all
been
planned
that
was
what
he
felt
by
the
loving
labor
of
countless
generations
in
a
homeless
man
like
himself
the
sight
created
a
realization
of
forlornness
he
had
traveled
five
continents
and
had
planted
his
affections
nowhere
it
was
the
same
with
his
human
relations
he
could
reckon
his
acquaintances
by
the
thousand
yet
there
was
no
one
to
whom
he
was
indispensably
dear
by
a
mental
transition
the
implication
of
which
he
scarcely
appreciated
he
began
to
think
of
santa
they
were
slowing
down
he
was
surprised
to
discover
that
an
hour
had
gone
by
the
man
at
his
side
folded
up
his
paper
now
that
they
were
about
to
part
he
considered
it
safe
to
be
friendly
coming
into
lewes
he
said
with
a
smile
seafold
train
will
be
waiting
just
across
the
platform
you
ca
miss
hindwood
thanked
him
brusquely
what
to
do
next
if
he
were
fortunate
in
catching
an
express
he
could
be
in
london
in
time
to
dine
as
he
stepped
out
he
saw
the
seafold
local
waiting
what
good
would
it
do
him
to
go
to
seafold
yet
to
quit
now
would
be
humiliatingly
unadventurous
he
was
moving
slowly
towards
the
stair
when
he
was
arrested
by
a
voice
you
would
mind
it
was
stupid
of
me
to
drop
he
turned
sharply
she
was
leaning
out
of
a
carriage
window
which
he
was
in
the
act
of
passing
without
giving
him
time
to
question
she
explained
ticket
it
slipped
from
my
hand
there
it
is
behind
the
moment
he
had
stooped
and
returned
it
she
withdrew
herself
it
had
happened
so
quickly
that
he
had
no
chance
to
guess
at
the
features
behind
the
heavy
veil
with
a
promptitude
of
decision
which
almost
deceived
himself
as
though
he
had
never
harbored
any
other
intention
he
opened
the
door
and
clambered
into
the
carriage
next
to
hers
that
he
thought
smiling
tolerantly
at
his
relieved
sense
of
satisfaction
and
then
was
no
accident
she
saw
that
i
was
giving
up
the
chase
she
did
it
to
keep
me
going
what
her
game
whatever
her
game
was
he
was
well
on
the
road
to
enlightenment
the
engine
was
puffing
through
a
valley
across
intersected
by
dykes
and
sluggish
streams
where
derelict
boats
lay
sunken
in
the
mud
rotting
among
the
grazing
sheep
made
the
quiet
plaintive
with
their
cries
gulls
disturbed
by
the
train
impetuous
onrush
rose
and
drifted
lazily
into
the
peace
that
slumbered
further
inland
of
a
sudden
with
a
gesture
of
exaltation
the
gleaming
of
the
coast
leaped
into
sight
and
beyond
them
the
dull
flash
of
the
channel
he
was
clamorous
with
excitement
curiosity
beat
masterfully
on
the
door
of
the
future
he
had
to
find
out
why
had
he
been
brought
here
what
had
santa
to
do
with
it
who
was
the
woman
in
the
next
compartment
they
had
halted
several
times
each
time
he
had
watched
carefully
to
see
whether
she
was
eluding
him
again
their
speed
was
slackening
they
were
entering
a
little
sandy
town
dotted
with
villas
bleached
by
the
wind
and
sun
he
caught
glimpses
between
the
houses
of
a
battered
esplanade
of
concrete
breakwaters
partly
destroyed
of
a
pebbly
beach
alternately
sucked
down
and
quarrelsomely
hurled
back
by
the
waves
over
all
hung
the
haunting
fragrance
of
salt
and
gorse
and
wild
thyme
they
had
come
to
a
standstill
passengers
were
climbing
out
and
greeting
friends
a
porter
flung
wide
the
door
of
his
carriage
shouting
seafold
having
watched
her
alight
he
followed
she
was
a
few
paces
ahead
picking
her
way
daintily
through
the
crowd
again
she
was
all
discretion
and
gave
no
hint
that
she
had
noticed
him
outside
the
gate
cabmen
offered
themselves
for
hire
she
shook
her
head
denyingly
and
passed
on
with
her
tripping
step
not
until
the
station
had
been
left
behind
did
he
remember
that
he
ought
to
have
inquired
at
what
times
the
trains
departed
for
london
too
late
his
immediate
business
was
keeping
her
in
sight
with
the
unhesitating
tread
of
one
familiar
with
her
surroundings
she
chose
what
seemed
to
be
the
most
important
street
it
was
narrow
and
flanked
by
little
stooping
cottages
most
of
which
had
been
converted
into
shops
which
cater
to
the
needs
of
tourists
it
was
the
end
of
the
season
a
few
remaining
visitors
were
sauntering
aimlessly
up
and
down
natives
standing
in
groups
had
the
appearance
of
being
fishermen
some
of
them
nodded
to
her
respectfully
without
halting
she
passed
them
with
a
pleasant
word
at
the
bottom
of
the
street
she
turned
into
a
road
paralleling
the
which
led
through
a
waste
of
turf
and
sand
into
the
uplands
of
the
open
country
just
where
the
country
met
the
town
there
stood
a
house
isolated
facing
seaward
surrounded
by
high
hedges
it
was
more
pretentious
than
any
he
had
seen
as
yet
giving
no
sign
that
she
was
aware
she
was
followed
she
pushed
open
the
rustic
gate
passed
up
the
path
produced
a
and
admitted
herself
there
in
the
bare
stretch
of
road
having
lured
him
all
the
way
from
london
without
a
single
backward
glance
or
any
sign
that
would
betray
her
recognition
of
his
presence
she
left
him
vii
just
what
i
might
have
expected
he
said
aloud
you
speak
ter
me
mister
he
swung
round
to
find
a
freckled
urchin
gazing
up
at
him
did
who
are
you
caddy
from
them
links
over
he
pointed
a
grubby
finger
along
the
road
to
where
half
a
mile
away
the
level
of
the
seashore
swept
up
into
a
bold
green
headland
i
guess
you
the
sort
of
boy
i
looking
for
who
lives
in
this
house
madam
something
or
other
name
sounds
does
she
look
like
she
a
widder
and
covers
up
not
but
what
she
gentlemen
friends
as
visits
seem
a
sharp
boy
can
you
tell
me
how
long
she
lived
here
a
year
off
and
on
that
ter
say
i
do
she
by
herself
an
old
woman
in
the
garden
sometimes
as
looks
a
she
wears
a
white
hanky
tied
round
think
that
all
i
want
to
ask
you
here
something
for
you
oh
yes
do
you
happen
to
know
about
the
trains
to
london
last
one
gorn
mister
if
that
what
yer
means
it
the
one
that
our
gents
at
the
aims
ter
i
out
of
luck
good
evening
sonny
and
thank
you
for
your
the
bare
legs
showed
no
signs
of
departing
the
freckled
face
still
gazed
up
interesting
you
my
way
of
speaking
i
the
boy
shook
his
head
canadian
soldiers
during
the
war
they
pretty
near
what
is
it
that
you
the
second
gent
to
slip
me
a
shilling
for
telling
about
this
and
it
something
he
sank
his
voice
to
a
whisper
look
round
there
been
some
one
from
a
bedroom
winder
most
of
the
time
as
we
been
talkin
best
be
goin
good
evenin
not
to
attract
attention
by
loitering
hindwood
set
off
at
a
businesslike
pace
down
the
road
toward
the
headland
as
he
drew
further
away
from
the
house
he
walked
more
slowly
he
was
trying
to
sort
out
his
facts
the
woman
who
lived
there
had
a
russian
name
santa
gorlof
she
dressed
like
a
widow
that
would
be
to
disguise
herself
the
news
about
the
gentlemen
friends
who
visited
her
was
quite
in
keeping
with
the
character
which
the
major
had
bestowed
on
her
but
not
at
all
welcome
she
had
lived
there
for
a
year
off
and
on
her
companion
was
an
old
woman
nearly
a
hundred
the
little
grandmother
but
who
was
this
man
who
earlier
in
the
day
had
bribed
the
boy
that
he
might
obtain
precisely
the
same
information
he
reminded
himself
that
the
police
were
hunting
for
her
the
man
might
be
a
detective
if
justice
had
already
run
her
to
earth
seafold
was
the
last
place
in
which
he
ought
to
be
found
if
the
boy
had
been
accurate
about
the
trains
there
was
no
escape
till
the
morning
even
though
he
were
to
hire
an
automobile
he
would
be
placing
his
visit
to
seafold
on
record
rose
up
rampant
what
a
fool
he
been
to
involve
himself
in
so
perilous
an
affair
and
yet
once
more
and
for
the
last
time
he
longed
to
see
santa
face
why
was
it
was
it
because
her
hearsay
wickedness
fascinated
him
it
was
not
because
he
loved
her
it
was
not
to
gratify
morbid
curiosity
at
least
not
entirely
perhaps
it
was
because
he
pitied
her
and
against
his
will
discovered
a
certain
grandeur
in
her
defiance
she
had
played
a
lone
hand
like
a
beast
of
prey
in
the
jungle
she
was
surrounded
at
this
moment
she
must
be
listening
for
the
stealthy
tread
of
those
who
were
encompassing
her
destruction
yet
she
had
not
lost
her
cunning
she
was
fighting
to
the
end
probably
this
time
as
when
the
waited
for
her
in
the
woods
of
vincennes
she
was
planning
to
employ
a
man
as
her
substitute
the
fact
remained
that
in
her
desperate
need
she
had
appealed
to
him
for
help
there
was
the
barest
chance
that
she
was
innocent
a
victim
of
circumstances
he
wanted
to
judge
her
for
himself
by
tearing
aside
the
widow
veil
and
gazing
on
her
destroying
beauty
turning
off
the
road
he
struck
across
the
links
climbing
toward
the
towering
headland
the
wind
coming
in
gusts
rustled
the
parched
gorse
and
brittle
fronds
of
bracken
behind
his
back
the
sun
was
setting
flinging
a
level
bar
of
gold
across
the
leaden
sea
in
sudden
lulls
when
the
wind
ceased
blowing
the
air
pulsated
with
the
rhythmic
cannonading
of
waves
assaulting
the
wall
of
cliffs
when
he
listened
intently
he
could
hear
the
of
their
cheering
and
their
sullen
moan
as
they
were
beaten
back
it
was
strange
to
think
that
two
weeks
ago
he
had
been
in
new
york
intent
on
nothing
but
acquiring
a
fortune
women
had
not
troubled
him
why
should
he
now
permit
this
woman
on
to
divert
him
a
woman
who
could
never
be
closer
to
him
he
had
reached
the
summit
of
the
promontory
etched
against
the
his
figure
must
be
visible
for
miles
the
sun
sank
lower
and
vanished
gazing
through
the
clear
atmosphere
far
below
him
he
could
discern
every
detail
of
the
house
to
which
he
had
been
tempted
it
looked
a
fitting
nest
for
an
old
poet
it
held
no
hint
of
terror
at
the
same
time
it
was
strategically
well
situated
for
occupants
who
wished
to
keep
an
eye
on
all
approaches
he
had
been
watching
for
any
sign
of
movement
when
a
curious
thing
happened
though
no
figure
appeared
from
one
of
the
upper
windows
a
white
cloth
fluttered
he
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
the
signal
was
repeated
he
tapped
his
breast
and
pointed
as
much
as
to
say
i
come
the
cloth
was
shaken
vigorously
on
repeating
the
experiment
he
obtained
the
same
result
when
he
nodded
his
head
in
assent
the
fluttering
ended
so
every
step
of
his
progress
had
been
observed
by
some
one
spying
through
a
telescope
from
behind
the
curtained
windows
the
first
moment
he
had
afforded
an
opportunity
by
looking
back
the
signaling
had
commenced
that
so
much
secrecy
should
be
employed
seemed
to
betoken
that
santa
case
was
desperate
that
she
should
have
run
the
risk
of
tempting
him
down
from
london
must
mean
that
he
possessed
some
peculiar
facility
for
rendering
her
a
much
needed
service
the
imminence
of
the
danger
both
to
her
and
to
himself
was
emphasized
by
this
latest
precaution
she
had
not
dared
to
admit
him
to
the
house
or
even
to
acknowledge
his
presence
until
she
had
made
certain
that
he
in
his
turn
was
not
followed
this
thought
that
he
might
be
followed
filled
him
with
an
entirely
new
sensation
it
peopled
every
clump
of
gorse
and
bed
of
bracken
with
possible
unseen
enemies
the
rustling
of
the
wind
the
cry
of
a
made
him
turn
alertly
scanning
with
suspicion
every
hollow
and
mound
of
the
wild
deserted
landscape
it
seemed
unwise
to
allow
his
actions
to
announce
his
intentions
too
plainly
what
his
intentions
were
he
was
not
very
certain
his
immediate
inclination
was
to
shake
himself
free
from
the
whole
mysterious
complication
continuing
his
ramble
he
assumed
a
careless
gait
descending
the
further
side
of
the
promontory
and
bearing
always
slightly
inland
so
that
his
course
might
lead
back
eventually
to
the
road
from
which
he
had
departed
as
dusk
was
gathering
he
found
himself
entering
an
abandoned
military
camp
the
bare
hutments
with
their
dusty
windows
and
padlocked
doors
stretched
away
in
seeming
endless
avenues
of
ghostly
silence
the
maple
leaf
painted
on
walls
and
explained
the
village
boy
reference
to
canadian
soldiers
he
had
reached
the
heart
of
it
when
he
was
possessed
by
the
overpowering
sensation
that
human
eyes
were
gazing
at
him
pulling
himself
up
he
glanced
back
across
his
shoulder
crooking
his
arm
to
ward
off
a
blow
realizing
what
he
was
doing
he
relaxed
and
stared
deliberately
about
him
nothing
no
sign
of
life
yet
the
certainty
remained
that
human
eyes
were
watching
he
muttered
contemptuously
it
was
dark
when
leaving
the
camp
he
struck
the
road
stars
were
coming
out
far
away
along
the
coast
the
distant
lights
of
a
harbor
blinked
and
twinkled
he
hurried
his
steps
his
mind
was
made
up
he
would
get
something
to
eat
in
seafold
discover
a
garage
hire
a
car
and
be
back
in
london
by
midnight
to
confirm
his
will
in
this
decision
he
began
making
plans
for
the
morrow
to
enter
the
town
he
had
to
pass
the
house
as
its
bulk
gathered
shape
his
feet
moved
more
slowly
long
before
he
came
opposite
it
he
had
caught
the
fragrance
of
the
myrtle
in
its
hedges
the
windows
which
looked
his
way
were
shrouded
he
paused
for
a
moment
outside
the
rustic
gate
he
was
saying
to
adventure
he
was
too
old
his
season
for
pardonable
folly
was
ended
the
prose
of
life
had
claimed
him
prolonging
the
pretense
of
temptation
he
pushed
open
the
gate
a
hand
touched
his
a
woman
the
desire
to
play
safe
faded
weakly
capitulating
he
allowed
himself
to
be
led
up
the
path
and
across
the
shadowy
threshold
the
door
of
the
darkened
house
closed
behind
him
she
was
slipping
the
bolts
into
place
viii
he
listened
he
could
not
see
her
face
only
the
blurred
outline
of
her
figure
except
for
the
sound
of
her
movements
the
silence
was
unbroken
at
the
end
of
a
passage
leading
from
the
hall
a
streak
of
gold
escaped
along
the
carpet
no
answer
why
have
you
brought
me
gliding
past
him
down
the
passage
she
darted
into
the
lighted
room
leaving
the
door
ajar
behind
her
he
followed
gropingly
as
he
entered
he
was
momentarily
confused
by
the
sudden
change
from
darkness
she
was
addressing
him
in
a
small
strained
voice
no
need
to
be
he
looked
about
him
searching
for
the
inspirer
of
fear
there
was
no
one
save
themselves
then
he
noticed
how
she
trembled
she
was
making
a
brave
effort
to
appear
collected
but
it
was
plain
that
she
was
wild
with
terror
her
eyes
were
wide
and
dilated
she
stood
on
the
defensive
backed
against
the
fireplace
as
though
she
were
expecting
violence
her
right
hand
was
in
advance
of
her
body
it
held
something
which
caught
the
glow
of
the
flames
a
revolver
cocked
and
ready
for
immediate
action
his
reception
was
so
different
from
anything
he
had
anticipated
that
he
stared
with
an
amused
expression
of
inquiry
at
last
he
asked
knew
from
the
start
that
i
thought
you
were
santa
biting
her
lip
to
prevent
herself
from
crying
she
nodded
far
from
being
santa
she
was
fair
as
any
dane
with
eyes
and
the
complexion
of
a
wild
rose
he
noted
the
little
wisps
of
curls
which
made
a
haze
of
gold
about
her
forehead
she
wore
turquoise
earrings
they
were
her
only
adornment
she
herself
was
a
decoration
she
was
like
a
statue
of
the
finest
porcelain
so
flawless
that
she
seemed
unreal
had
it
not
been
for
her
widow
mourning
he
would
have
said
that
she
was
untouched
by
passionate
experience
she
had
an
appearance
of
provoking
innocence
which
made
the
paleness
of
her
beauty
ardent
as
a
flame
speaking
quietly
not
easily
frightened
he
said
you
while
you
keep
me
covered
with
that
revolver
have
no
reason
to
be
afraid
any
moment
you
choose
you
can
kill
me
you
only
to
press
the
tears
of
horror
sprang
into
her
eyes
i
do
want
to
kill
illustration
why
do
you
lay
it
aside
she
gazed
at
him
appealingly
i
alone
i
may
need
it
to
protect
me
no
i
should
think
you
can
see
was
the
house
really
empty
he
listened
it
was
possible
that
some
one
might
steal
up
from
behind
he
did
not
dare
to
turn
his
only
chance
of
preventing
her
from
shooting
him
was
to
keep
her
engaged
in
conversation
you
feel
this
way
why
did
you
go
to
such
elaborate
pains
to
force
me
to
visit
you
you
must
have
known
that
i
did
want
to
come
it
is
i
who
have
he
smiled
cheerfully
the
risk
of
appearing
rude
i
be
frank
with
you
when
you
crossed
my
path
at
the
ritz
i
was
on
the
point
of
keeping
a
most
important
engagement
when
i
followed
you
out
of
the
hotel
it
was
because
of
a
message
found
pinned
to
my
pillow
the
widow
so
it
was
you
in
particular
that
i
was
following
i
have
followed
any
widow
i
expected
that
you
speak
to
me
as
soon
as
we
were
in
the
street
no
intention
of
giving
up
my
appointment
you
did
you
led
me
on
further
and
further
a
step
at
a
time
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
when
i
found
myself
in
the
train
i
was
extremely
annoyed
by
the
time
i
arrived
at
lewes
i
fully
made
up
my
mind
to
abandon
the
chase
then
you
spoke
to
me
i
wasted
so
much
of
my
afternoon
that
i
like
being
beaten
you
roused
my
curiosity
here
in
seafold
you
dodged
me
and
left
me
standing
in
the
road
like
a
dummy
that
used
up
the
of
my
patience
i
was
mad
clean
through
i
did
care
if
i
never
saw
you
again
when
you
signaled
me
on
the
headland
i
signaled
back
that
i
was
coming
i
was
i
was
tired
of
being
led
on
and
eluded
when
you
caught
me
at
the
gate
i
was
flirting
with
temptation
but
i
already
laid
my
plans
to
be
back
in
london
by
midnight
so
you
see
you
can
scarcely
blame
me
for
being
here
the
shoe
on
the
other
foot
entirely
you
put
me
to
great
inconvenience
merely
to
tell
me
it
would
seem
that
you
do
want
to
shoot
why
not
throw
the
thing
away
you
far
more
scared
of
it
than
i
i
may
have
to
use
whom
a
sweet
slow
smile
turned
up
the
edges
of
her
mouth
orders
were
to
keep
you
here
if
once
i
managed
to
persuade
you
he
laughed
outright
hate
having
me
here
and
you
hate
to
see
me
go
is
that
the
way
the
land
lies
i
more
or
less
in
the
same
fix
i
did
want
to
come
and
i
do
want
to
stay
the
fact
remains
that
we
both
here
why
not
make
the
best
of
it
if
you
stop
brandishing
that
weapon
i
feel
much
more
comfortable
i
not
trying
to
for
the
first
time
he
dared
to
shift
his
position
be
alarmed
he
warned
her
easier
i
was
stiff
now
if
you
listen
a
proposal
to
make
you
treating
me
like
a
burglar
which
is
fair
you
may
know
but
i
not
the
least
idea
how
long
you
intend
to
hold
me
prisoner
i
guess
you
waiting
for
some
one
else
to
arrive
but
neither
here
nor
there
before
the
third
person
comes
you
may
have
shot
me
of
course
by
accident
revolvers
go
off
if
you
keep
them
too
long
pointed
you
know
nothing
about
firearms
and
i
beginning
to
be
rather
fond
of
life
here
what
i
propose
if
you
put
it
away
i
give
you
my
parole
not
to
come
within
two
yards
of
you
or
to
attempt
to
escape
if
i
want
my
parole
back
you
shall
have
a
full
five
i
thought
that
i
could
trust
you
can
is
it
a
bargain
without
answering
placing
her
weapon
on
the
mantelpiece
she
turned
her
back
on
him
she
seemed
waiting
to
hear
him
advance
further
into
the
room
he
did
not
stir
is
it
hindwood
that
i
just
remembered
one
thing
for
which
our
armistice
has
not
provided
you
better
pick
up
your
gun
again
it
that
i
dined
i
wonder
whether
you
let
me
into
the
village
he
left
his
sentence
unended
he
suddenly
perceived
that
she
was
shaken
with
sobbing
in
his
concern
he
forgot
his
compact
as
to
distance
and
hurried
over
to
her
side
she
swung
round
her
face
blinded
with
tears
as
she
stumbled
past
him
she
muttered
beaten
me
you
not
afraid
i
could
shoot
you
now
if
i
ix
tiptoeing
to
the
threshold
he
turned
the
handle
and
peeped
into
the
passage
as
before
everything
was
in
darkness
he
was
free
to
go
there
was
nothing
to
stop
him
nothing
except
his
honor
it
was
easy
to
argue
that
even
his
honor
did
not
prevent
him
he
had
canceled
his
parole
when
he
had
reopened
negotiations
by
telling
her
to
pick
up
her
revolver
she
had
left
it
behind
her
on
the
he
took
it
in
his
hand
and
examined
it
it
was
a
repeater
every
chamber
was
loaded
he
whistled
softly
so
she
had
meant
business
setting
the
hammer
at
he
slipped
the
weapon
in
his
pocket
he
was
master
of
the
situation
now
why
did
he
go
two
hours
of
steady
driving
three
at
the
most
and
he
could
be
in
london
he
reminded
himself
that
at
this
very
moment
his
private
papers
might
be
in
the
process
of
being
ransacked
what
if
they
were
the
possibility
left
him
utterly
indifferent
he
could
save
them
after
the
lapse
of
another
three
hours
no
the
truth
was
that
since
his
voyage
on
the
all
the
emphases
of
his
life
were
becoming
altered
the
importance
of
money
and
power
no
longer
seemed
paramount
after
nearly
forty
years
of
living
he
had
awakened
to
the
fact
that
it
was
women
who
shed
a
radiance
of
glamour
in
an
otherwise
gloomy
world
of
all
human
adventures
they
were
the
most
enthralling
and
the
least
certain
of
rewarding
it
was
curiosity
that
had
enticed
him
into
his
present
entanglements
his
curiosity
had
yet
to
be
satisfied
with
a
revolver
in
his
pocket
he
felt
that
he
now
possessed
the
means
of
extracting
the
right
answers
to
his
questions
he
had
suffered
mild
inconveniences
but
so
far
he
had
done
so
badly
he
had
established
mysterious
relations
with
two
beautiful
women
one
of
them
was
already
under
the
same
roof
the
other
he
believed
was
momentarily
expected
he
began
to
figure
himself
as
a
poet
a
dreamer
a
potential
of
romance
all
because
she
has
blue
eyes
he
hinted
then
he
remembered
that
santa
eyes
were
gray
and
that
up
to
the
last
it
had
been
santa
whom
he
had
supposed
that
he
was
following
he
gazed
about
him
making
an
inspection
of
the
room
trying
to
guess
at
the
characters
of
its
inhabitants
it
was
square
and
small
its
walls
were
lined
with
shelves
overloaded
with
books
of
a
learned
appearance
a
stood
on
a
mahogany
desk
with
mending
scissors
and
reels
of
cotton
strewn
near
it
a
piano
had
been
crushed
into
a
corner
looking
flippantly
out
of
place
amid
these
scholarly
surroundings
below
the
mantelshelf
was
a
rack
containing
a
row
of
pipes
set
about
wherever
a
space
allowed
were
vases
of
freshly
cut
flowers
the
contradictions
of
the
room
suggested
that
it
had
once
been
a
den
but
had
now
been
taken
over
by
a
woman
this
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
owner
of
the
house
was
actually
a
widow
almost
the
whole
of
the
wall
confronting
the
door
was
occupied
by
a
tall
french
window
which
opened
directly
on
a
lawn
shrubs
grew
about
it
instinct
told
him
that
this
was
the
likeliest
approach
for
the
other
person
by
whose
order
his
kidnaping
had
been
plotted
he
felt
convinced
that
this
person
would
prove
to
be
a
woman
but
he
was
taking
no
chances
with
the
night
behind
her
she
could
spy
on
him
for
hours
without
being
detected
she
might
be
spying
on
him
now
assuming
a
listless
manner
he
seated
himself
to
one
side
of
the
fireplace
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
without
seeming
to
do
so
he
watched
the
shadowy
panes
his
right
hand
was
thrust
into
his
pocket
gripping
the
revolver
after
the
lapse
of
some
minutes
he
heard
in
the
passage
the
returning
footsteps
outside
the
door
she
halted
fumbling
at
the
handle
giving
up
the
attempt
she
called
to
him
to
open
just
as
he
was
rising
a
face
tense
with
eagerness
lifted
itself
out
of
the
bushes
peering
in
on
him
chapter
the
fourth
he
becomes
part
of
the
game
i
the
face
hung
there
against
the
darkness
for
a
second
then
the
leaves
closed
over
it
as
it
was
stealthily
withdrawn
in
the
utterness
of
his
astonishment
hindwood
all
but
gave
himself
away
it
was
not
the
face
he
had
expected
masking
his
excitement
with
a
yawn
he
turned
his
back
on
the
window
and
stepped
toward
the
door
opening
it
sufficiently
to
thrust
his
head
into
the
passage
but
not
wide
enough
to
permit
the
watcher
in
the
bushes
to
learn
anything
of
the
person
with
whom
he
talked
he
found
his
captress
standing
just
beyond
the
threshold
carrying
a
tray
which
accounted
for
her
awkwardness
wo
have
to
dine
in
the
village
she
explained
then
catching
his
strange
expression
has
happened
one
was
to
come
he
whispered
person
who
gave
orders
for
my
kidnaping
is
that
so
she
was
to
enter
through
the
window
from
the
lawn
while
you
held
me
prisoner
at
the
she
here
but
a
man
who
is
her
enemy
a
major
cleasby
he
hiding
directly
in
her
path
he
supposed
you
were
she
when
you
tried
the
door
he
showed
his
face
is
there
any
way
in
which
we
can
warn
her
the
widow
set
down
her
tray
her
eyes
met
his
searchingly
the
man
were
there
you
would
want
to
save
not
you
think
i
invented
the
man
in
the
bushes
in
order
that
santa
may
be
scared
away
i
no
more
afraid
of
santa
than
i
was
of
you
besides
in
your
absence
i
stolen
your
revolver
ah
that
convinces
you
the
man
her
husband
and
a
secret
service
agent
i
can
feel
his
eyes
in
my
back
if
you
do
warn
her
she
be
caught
there
must
have
been
some
prearranged
signal
what
was
it
instead
of
answering
she
pressed
nearer
glancing
fearfully
across
her
shoulder
into
the
unlighted
hall
her
voice
came
so
faintly
that
he
could
only
just
hear
her
would
spare
us
why
should
you
and
i
you
do
know
what
she
he
smiled
grimly
can
guess
i
was
to
have
been
her
scapegoat
for
the
rogovich
murder
she
was
staging
a
new
version
of
what
happened
in
the
woods
of
vincennes
whether
she
escaped
or
was
brought
to
trial
i
was
to
have
been
arrested
by
that
time
she
would
have
clothed
me
with
the
appearance
of
her
guilt
i
was
to
have
figured
as
her
lover
and
the
prince
rival
the
motive
for
my
crime
was
to
have
been
jealousy
the
old
story
an
innocent
man
dying
in
her
stead
you
think
you
know
that
why
should
you
unless
you
are
her
lover
she
a
her
hands
seized
his
coaxing
him
from
the
doorway
into
the
darkened
passage
the
love
of
god
go
she
implored
give
you
back
your
drawing
her
to
him
he
held
her
fast
struggle
he
might
hear
you
you
decoyed
me
you
trapped
me
why
this
change
what
makes
you
so
concerned
for
my
safety
did
know
she
panted
kind
of
man
you
kind
her
heart
beat
wildly
she
lay
against
him
unstirring
her
face
averted
the
moment
he
released
her
she
burst
forth
into
new
pleading
my
sake
i
beg
of
into
the
grimness
of
his
smiling
there
stole
a
gleam
of
tenderness
leave
you
i
guess
not
what
the
signal
then
he
said
shall
play
for
me
while
you
play
if
we
mask
our
expressions
we
can
talk
of
what
we
choose
outwardly
to
deceive
the
man
in
the
bushes
we
must
act
a
part
i
an
old
friend
i
dropped
in
unexpectedly
you
provided
me
with
supper
while
i
eat
we
chatter
and
laugh
you
sit
at
the
piano
and
sing
for
me
occasionally
when
the
hour
for
santa
arrival
is
past
i
take
my
leave
if
you
brave
we
can
carry
the
farce
through
are
you
game
for
answer
she
picked
up
the
tray
and
stepped
into
the
room
smiling
back
at
him
as
he
followed
your
humble
servant
as
always
but
i
have
only
two
hands
and
they
occupied
if
you
bring
up
that
table
yes
set
it
before
the
fire
that
right
you
must
be
comfortable
if
i
to
sing
for
ii
she
wo
come
the
words
reached
him
in
a
sigh
the
pale
hands
fluttered
from
the
keyboard
the
fair
head
dropped
almost
instantly
she
straightened
herself
banishing
her
appearance
of
weariness
think
that
showing
the
white
feather
it
only
that
i
exhausted
she
wo
come
now
i
sure
of
then
bending
forward
with
a
nervous
tremor
dare
look
round
has
he
gone
hindwood
pushed
back
his
chair
from
before
the
hearth
for
the
moment
he
did
not
answer
he
was
striving
to
restore
the
spell
which
the
intrusion
of
her
fear
had
broken
glancing
at
her
sideways
he
regarded
her
quietly
where
she
sat
at
the
piano
in
her
widow
garb
through
the
window
at
her
back
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
garden
shadowy
and
patched
with
moonlight
above
the
silence
he
heard
the
rumble
of
waves
sifting
the
pebbles
on
the
shore
who
was
she
this
woman
who
possessed
the
magic
to
enchant
him
who
had
been
her
husband
what
kind
of
man
had
she
loved
him
how
long
since
he
had
died
there
were
so
many
questions
she
had
persuaded
him
into
following
her
well
knowing
that
he
believed
her
to
be
santa
she
had
met
his
discovery
of
her
impersonation
with
a
threat
when
the
luck
was
all
in
her
favor
with
the
panic
of
a
stricken
conscience
she
had
thrown
in
her
hand
for
the
past
two
hours
in
this
cozy
room
she
had
surrounded
him
with
shy
intimacies
of
affection
to
the
end
that
the
unseen
spectator
listening
outside
the
panes
might
be
beguiled
apparently
the
deception
had
succeeded
the
spectator
had
given
no
sign
it
had
succeeded
too
well
for
hindwood
it
had
roused
in
him
the
longing
that
behind
her
pretense
of
friendship
there
might
lurk
a
genuine
emotion
of
liking
he
had
tried
to
forget
that
the
scene
was
he
had
wanted
to
believe
that
it
was
real
he
gone
there
was
a
break
in
her
voice
he
pulled
himself
together
you
wish
me
to
make
certain
rising
he
lounged
over
to
the
piano
as
though
to
select
a
sheet
from
the
pile
of
music
in
a
flash
he
turned
wrenching
wide
the
doors
of
the
and
was
across
the
step
in
a
bound
nothing
rose
from
the
shadows
to
disturb
the
peace
of
the
night
stooping
by
the
bushes
he
made
a
hurried
examination
he
called
then
seeing
how
she
pressed
her
hands
against
her
mouth
no
need
to
when
she
was
standing
by
his
side
he
explained
you
might
think
that
i
tricked
you
i
want
you
to
see
for
yourself
here
where
he
was
hiding
when
he
peered
in
on
me
the
ground
trampled
the
bushes
are
bent
may
be
still
here
she
whispered
the
garden
hindwood
smiled
reassuringly
into
her
upturned
face
would
do
you
any
harm
if
he
were
remember
he
a
secret
service
agent
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
ought
to
make
you
feel
she
knotted
her
hands
against
her
breast
i
ever
feel
safe
oh
if
i
could
confess
to
you
to
any
one
it
would
help
without
giving
him
a
chance
to
finish
his
sentence
she
plucked
at
his
sleeve
with
the
eagerness
of
a
child
you
me
iii
they
had
reentered
the
room
fastening
the
window
securely
behind
them
when
that
was
done
they
had
drawn
the
curtains
across
the
panes
she
had
flung
herself
into
a
chair
beside
the
fire
and
was
waiting
impatiently
for
him
to
join
her
but
he
hovered
in
the
center
of
the
room
fingering
his
watch
and
looking
troubled
delaying
you
she
asked
without
turning
he
slipped
his
watch
into
his
pocket
had
no
idea
it
was
so
that
matter
till
morning
there
are
no
was
thinking
of
be
so
what
am
i
with
me
she
said
lazily
the
room
became
profoundly
silent
the
darkened
house
seemed
to
listen
had
he
plumbed
a
new
depth
in
this
drama
of
betrayal
at
the
moment
when
he
hoped
he
had
discovered
loyalty
he
had
been
deceived
by
women
before
had
he
not
allowed
santa
to
deceive
him
he
would
not
have
been
here
he
might
tell
himself
that
this
woman
was
different
if
a
man
did
not
tell
himself
that
each
new
woman
was
different
the
mischief
of
love
would
end
he
caught
sight
of
her
flaxen
head
and
became
ashamed
of
his
reflections
it
was
possible
if
the
soul
was
foul
that
the
flesh
should
be
so
fair
she
had
the
wonder
of
the
dawn
in
her
eyes
nothing
that
she
had
said
or
done
could
belie
the
frankness
of
her
innocence
standing
behind
her
chair
he
gazed
down
in
puzzlement
at
her
graciousness
are
conventions
we
may
have
met
unconventionally
but
neither
of
us
can
afford
to
ignore
without
looking
up
she
answered
you
were
as
alone
as
i
am
you
could
afford
to
ignore
i
you
think
i
he
spoke
gently
suppose
no
man
can
ever
be
so
lonely
as
a
woman
especially
as
a
woman
who
has
lost
her
happiness
but
i
too
have
been
lonely
everybody
has
the
cowardice
which
comes
of
loneliness
is
responsible
for
nearly
every
wickedness
most
thefts
and
cheatings
and
even
murders
are
committed
in
an
effort
to
gain
companionship
but
you
ca
elude
loneliness
by
wherever
you
go
it
with
you
from
birth
to
death
brave
people
make
it
their
friend
cowards
let
it
become
their
tempter
loneliness
is
no
excuse
for
nor
even
for
surrendering
to
the
appearance
of
trying
to
share
with
you
my
experience
until
this
afternoon
you
did
know
that
i
existed
all
your
life
up
to
the
last
five
minutes
you
been
able
to
do
without
me
do
be
greedy
and
spoil
everything
before
it
started
there
wait
for
when
i
trust
you
now
he
stooped
lower
she
had
become
irresistibly
dear
in
a
rush
he
had
found
the
clue
to
her
character
her
childishness
she
could
bear
to
postpone
the
things
she
wanted
me
i
wonder
you
the
first
woman
to
have
the
daring
to
tell
me
i
not
sure
that
i
feel
complimented
at
this
hour
of
night
one
has
to
be
a
little
cold
to
be
trusted
like
that
but
i
trust
you
which
is
strange
after
all
that
happened
the
person
i
distrust
is
myself
you
beautiful
the
most
beautiful
i
more
beautiful
than
santa
he
caught
the
vision
of
her
blue
eyes
glinting
up
at
him
there
was
nothing
roguish
in
their
expression
they
were
pathetic
in
their
earnestness
her
throat
was
stretched
back
white
and
firm
her
lips
were
vivid
and
parted
her
question
sounded
like
the
ruse
of
a
coquette
yet
she
seemed
wholly
unaware
of
her
attraction
he
drew
himself
erect
staring
at
the
wall
that
he
might
forbid
himself
the
danger
of
looking
at
her
his
voice
came
harsh
and
abrupt
confession
can
keep
till
morning
one
can
say
and
unsay
anything
deeds
that
can
never
be
he
had
reached
the
door
she
spoke
dully
despise
and
then
my
life
i
waited
for
go
glancing
across
his
shoulder
he
saw
her
a
mist
of
gold
in
a
great
emptiness
slowly
he
turned
back
you
guess
the
reason
for
my
going
i
reverence
you
too
clutching
at
his
hands
she
dragged
herself
to
her
feet
friendship
that
i
asking
what
the
use
of
reverence
like
me
a
little
you
do
more
for
santa
only
to
like
me
would
cost
you
iv
i
should
have
died
if
you
left
he
was
feeling
both
amused
and
annoyed
at
his
surrender
at
the
same
time
he
was
on
the
alert
for
developments
she
had
extinguished
the
lamps
the
sole
illumination
was
the
firelight
for
what
reason
she
had
done
it
whether
as
an
aid
to
confession
or
as
a
discouragement
to
watchers
she
allowed
him
to
guess
whatever
the
reason
the
precaution
was
wise
but
it
increased
the
atmosphere
of
liaison
he
had
pushed
back
his
chair
to
the
extreme
corner
of
the
hearth
so
that
he
was
scarcely
discernible
she
sat
where
the
glow
from
the
coals
beat
up
into
her
face
he
saw
her
profile
against
a
background
of
darkness
he
pursed
his
lips
in
masculine
omniscience
have
gone
to
your
bed
and
had
a
good
night
should
i
was
in
terror
i
used
to
be
afraid
only
by
night
now
it
both
day
and
night
you
never
afraid
you
were
afraid
even
when
i
how
do
you
manage
it
doing
things
instead
of
thinking
about
the
things
that
can
be
done
to
me
i
learned
that
what
we
fear
never
happens
fear
a
waste
of
time
fear
imagination
playing
tricks
by
pouncing
out
of
cupboards
it
the
idiot
of
the
intellect
gibbering
in
the
attic
after
nightfall
ips
a
coward
spreading
cowardice
with
false
alarms
it
a
liar
and
a
libeller
life
a
thousand
times
kinder
than
fear
would
have
us
paint
she
sighed
happily
was
kind
to
me
he
waited
for
her
confession
to
commence
she
leaned
back
her
eyes
half
shut
watching
the
red
landscape
in
the
dancing
flames
time
moved
gently
night
seemed
eternal
her
contentment
proved
contagious
neither
of
them
spoke
nothing
mattered
save
the
comfort
of
her
presence
in
a
hollow
of
the
coals
he
invented
a
dream
cottage
to
which
he
would
take
her
it
had
a
scarlet
wood
behind
it
and
mountains
with
caves
as
the
fire
settled
the
mirage
faded
it
strike
you
as
comic
he
questioned
you
and
i
should
sit
here
after
midnight
and
that
i
should
even
know
what
to
call
you
anna
she
nodded
are
you
russian
ivan
varensky
say
it
proudly
as
though
i
ought
to
know
who
ivan
varensky
she
turned
her
head
slowly
wondering
at
him
only
one
ivan
varensky
the
man
who
wanted
to
be
like
hindwood
jerked
himself
into
wakefulness
afraid
i
need
enlightenment
i
do
do
she
contradicted
patiently
rather
you
will
when
helped
you
to
recall
him
how
hurt
he
would
be
poor
ivan
that
a
man
of
your
standing
should
so
soon
have
forgotten
him
he
hoped
to
make
such
a
noise
in
the
world
after
czardom
had
fallen
he
aimed
to
be
a
savior
healing
men
with
words
but
he
wanted
to
be
crucified
at
once
he
cared
more
for
calvary
than
for
the
road
that
led
up
to
it
he
was
an
emotionalist
impatient
of
gethsemane
it
was
the
crown
of
thorns
that
he
coveted
having
only
words
with
which
to
save
humanity
he
dashed
all
over
russia
in
special
trains
speechifying
at
every
foretelling
his
approaching
end
he
had
no
time
to
waste
he
believed
his
days
were
numbered
his
message
was
always
the
same
whether
he
was
addressing
the
duma
armies
marching
into
action
or
a
handful
of
peasants
he
was
about
to
die
for
russia
then
suddenly
trotzky
and
lenine
came
they
were
men
who
did
things
they
overthrew
his
government
worse
still
they
refused
to
fulfill
his
prophecies
instead
of
executing
him
they
bundled
him
into
exile
to
be
forced
to
live
when
he
had
pledged
himself
to
die
was
a
more
cruel
crucifixion
than
any
he
had
anticipated
he
found
himself
nailed
to
the
cross
of
ridicule
with
no
one
to
applaud
his
sacrifice
he
was
left
with
nothing
to
talk
about
for
the
thing
he
had
talked
about
had
not
happened
he
was
an
idealist
an
inspirer
a
prophet
but
because
death
had
avoided
him
there
was
no
gospel
to
write
having
climbed
the
long
road
to
calvary
he
had
the
tragedy
to
survive
do
think
i
belittling
him
i
loved
him
it
was
a
proud
but
not
an
easy
task
to
be
the
wife
of
a
man
who
wanted
to
be
like
she
collapsed
into
silence
sitting
lost
in
thought
her
arms
hanging
limply
by
her
sides
he
wondered
what
pictures
she
was
seeing
in
the
fire
armed
men
marching
revolution
palaces
going
up
in
dame
of
course
he
remembered
the
varensky
she
had
described
the
varensky
who
in
the
darkest
hour
of
the
war
had
hurled
himself
like
a
to
the
rescue
of
the
allies
it
was
he
who
was
to
have
consolidated
russia
leading
its
millions
in
an
endless
tide
to
the
defeat
of
the
enemies
of
righteousness
it
was
freedom
he
had
promised
freedom
to
everybody
he
had
preached
that
every
man
was
good
in
himself
that
the
things
that
made
men
bad
were
laws
therefore
he
had
swept
all
laws
aside
he
had
done
away
with
compulsion
repealed
death
penalties
thrown
prisons
wide
for
a
day
and
night
he
had
held
the
stage
a
shining
figure
adored
by
despairing
eyes
then
the
slaves
whom
he
had
released
from
restraints
had
surged
over
him
he
had
vanished
trampled
beneath
ungrateful
feet
and
russia
had
become
a
mob
so
this
was
varensky
wife
he
felt
awed
the
romantic
heroism
of
her
husband
failure
clothed
her
with
a
wistful
sacredness
three
years
ago
he
could
not
have
approached
her
he
would
scarcely
have
dared
to
have
regarded
her
as
a
woman
the
hysteria
of
the
moment
had
canonized
her
streets
through
which
she
drove
in
petrograd
had
been
lined
with
kneeling
throngs
there
had
been
something
medieval
in
the
spontaneity
of
her
worship
it
had
been
rumored
that
she
was
a
bride
immaculate
that
her
purity
was
the
secret
of
her
husband
strength
her
face
made
the
story
credible
it
had
the
virgin
innocence
of
a
saint
and
here
he
was
allowed
to
sit
beside
her
with
three
years
gone
sharing
her
hearth
in
this
obscure
place
of
hiding
were
a
russian
joan
of
arc
he
declared
enthusiastically
well
i
remember
all
the
legends
one
read
about
you
and
varensky
it
does
matter
that
he
failed
his
was
the
most
gallant
figure
of
the
entire
war
when
every
nation
was
embittered
he
set
us
an
example
of
how
not
to
hate
he
refused
to
kill
when
all
of
us
were
slaying
he
had
the
courage
of
meekness
in
that
at
least
he
followed
christ
what
became
of
him
there
was
a
report
have
been
many
reports
she
interrupted
sadly
the
latest
be
true
i
wear
mourning
i
wear
mourning
for
him
always
before
his
fall
i
was
his
perpetual
bride
since
his
fall
i
am
his
perpetual
widow
he
wishes
to
be
dead
so
to
please
him
he
still
alive
immediately
he
was
conscious
of
the
indecency
of
his
disappointment
she
gazed
into
the
darkness
with
a
mild
surprise
do
not
know
i
never
know
that
the
torture
of
it
he
was
always
less
a
man
than
a
spirit
i
begin
to
think
he
can
not
want
him
if
she
had
heard
his
uncompleted
question
she
ignored
it
with
folded
hands
she
stared
into
the
red
heart
of
the
fire
behind
her
across
the
walls
and
ceiling
as
flames
leaped
and
flickered
shadows
took
fantastic
shapes
when
she
spoke
as
though
she
were
talking
to
herself
her
words
came
softly
was
such
a
child
so
dear
so
vain
so
intense
so
sensitive
why
did
he
marry
me
if
it
was
only
to
resign
me
he
treated
me
as
he
treated
russia
we
were
both
waiting
for
him
to
take
us
in
his
arms
but
it
was
always
ideals
things
one
ca
embrace
that
drew
out
his
affections
had
he
loved
humanity
less
and
individuals
more
he
could
have
gone
so
far
there
was
something
monstrous
about
his
perhaps
he
denied
himself
the
things
for
which
he
did
not
care
he
wanted
to
seem
nobler
than
any
one
else
through
egotism
he
missed
his
chance
had
he
planned
to
live
he
could
have
killed
his
enemies
and
prevented
revolution
there
was
a
time
when
he
could
have
crushed
both
lenine
and
trotzky
but
he
had
to
be
too
noble
he
said
their
ideal
is
more
right
than
mine
it
will
conquer
truth
can
not
be
silenced
by
slaughter
it
was
his
inhuman
magnanimity
that
defeated
him
so
lenine
and
trotzky
grew
strong
and
crushed
him
because
he
had
planned
to
die
millions
are
starving
and
russia
is
in
he
does
own
it
his
heart
yes
like
a
general
who
has
blundered
the
vision
of
lost
battlefields
is
forever
in
his
eyes
the
forests
of
white
crosses
his
egotism
is
gone
he
wants
to
make
atonement
to
perish
seems
the
only
way
any
one
who
would
delay
him
even
though
she
were
a
woman
who
loved
him
is
his
enemy
in
his
remorse
he
hounds
death
as
other
men
avoid
it
he
head
of
the
counterrevolution
and
goes
continually
into
russia
for
the
overthrow
of
bolshevism
not
that
he
hopes
for
success
but
that
he
may
be
put
against
a
wall
and
always
he
returns
until
this
last
her
voice
sank
away
in
a
whisper
he
eyed
her
with
misgiving
what
was
it
she
desired
read
something
of
this
he
been
missing
for
a
long
time
long
coming
out
of
the
shadows
so
that
she
could
see
his
face
he
drew
his
chair
close
to
hers
what
has
this
to
do
with
your
confession
v
she
flinched
as
though
he
had
made
a
motion
to
strike
her
confession
ah
yes
i
she
tried
to
smile
stretching
out
her
hand
she
touched
him
in
a
timid
appeal
for
understanding
taking
it
between
his
own
he
held
it
fast
that
he
said
though
it
were
a
bird
that
tired
it
is
its
own
nest
but
it
safe
and
warm
let
it
rest
till
it
grows
good
she
faltered
good
men
are
he
laughed
i
not
good
on
the
other
hand
i
suppose
i
bad
i
simply
a
man
who
always
had
to
fight
so
i
know
what
it
like
to
be
up
against
it
you
up
against
it
at
present
you
can
see
nothing
before
you
but
a
high
stone
wall
with
no
way
round
it
i
been
there
and
i
found
that
when
you
ca
get
round
a
wall
there
usually
a
door
what
do
you
say
shall
we
look
for
a
door
together
she
sank
her
head
day
and
night
in
three
interminable
years
i
looked
for
it
i
like
a
person
lost
in
a
fog
standing
still
listening
running
to
death
she
nodded
do
be
scared
stop
running
wait
for
your
fear
to
catch
up
with
you
if
you
face
it
it
shrink
to
nothing
the
feet
of
a
pursuer
are
like
an
army
what
causing
your
panic
varensky
the
thought
that
he
may
not
return
he
may
he
may
go
on
wasting
me
she
waited
for
him
to
say
something
when
he
remained
silent
she
bent
forward
staring
vacantly
into
the
hearth
i
a
coward
and
unfaithful
perhaps
if
he
been
successful
i
know
what
he
thinks
of
me
that
i
a
wife
but
i
not
if
it
would
help
him
give
my
life
for
him
he
does
want
my
life
he
does
want
my
body
he
wants
the
one
thing
that
i
ca
give
him
that
i
should
believe
in
him
there
are
people
who
still
believe
in
him
the
little
grandmother
there
are
others
like
prince
rogovich
who
pretended
to
believe
in
him
that
he
might
use
him
as
a
he
says
to
me
for
the
last
time
and
vanishes
i
wait
in
retirement
for
news
of
his
execution
at
the
end
of
two
months
three
months
half
a
year
he
comes
back
then
the
rehearsing
for
his
martyrdom
commences
all
afresh
if
there
were
anything
i
could
do
but
to
be
wasted
for
no
purpose
she
turned
her
head
wearily
glancing
at
him
sideways
called
me
the
joan
of
russia
i
was
almost
there
was
a
time
when
not
to
be
loved
and
not
to
be
a
mother
seemed
a
small
price
to
pay
for
sainthood
it
was
my
happiness
against
the
happiness
of
millions
but
now
her
eyes
filmed
over
now
he
prompted
she
brushed
her
tears
away
with
pitiful
defiance
want
to
be
a
woman
to
be
everything
in
some
man
you
are
in
his
but
he
does
show
she
seemed
to
listen
for
laughter
then
she
said
i
try
to
be
a
woman
i
play
satan
to
that
the
wall
all
of
it
there
in
the
swift
march
of
his
emotions
he
had
almost
forgotten
santa
as
though
she
had
been
drowning
and
he
had
turned
back
from
rescuing
her
the
mention
of
her
name
stung
him
with
reproach
of
santa
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
vi
she
in
love
with
my
he
let
go
her
hand
you
mind
if
i
smoke
perhaps
you
join
me
no
he
took
his
time
while
he
lit
his
cigarette
then
speaking
slowly
ca
believe
all
the
evil
that
i
heard
about
this
woman
and
yet
i
ought
every
fresh
person
has
told
me
something
increasingly
vile
to
make
a
case
against
her
i
have
only
to
take
all
the
trouble
caused
me
i
meet
her
on
a
liner
and
part
with
her
on
landing
from
that
moment
i
have
no
peace
i
pestered
by
strangers
accusing
and
defending
her
my
room
is
entered
by
spies
i
find
an
anonymous
note
pinned
to
my
pillow
i
lured
out
of
london
into
the
heart
of
the
country
on
the
pretext
that
she
in
danger
and
i
can
help
her
you
know
the
rest
until
the
happenings
of
tonight
the
most
probable
explanation
seemed
to
be
that
she
had
taken
a
secret
fancy
to
me
and
had
turned
to
me
in
her
distress
when
she
found
herself
suspected
of
a
crime
that
theory
hold
water
any
could
you
tell
me
she
in
love
with
your
can
be
in
love
with
as
many
men
as
serve
her
purpose
the
only
loyalty
to
which
she
constant
is
the
memory
of
her
dead
he
shook
himself
irritably
that
you
or
any
one
has
told
me
explains
her
she
left
on
me
an
impression
of
nobility
which
absolutely
contradicts
all
this
later
information
until
i
met
you
it
almost
seemed
there
was
a
conspiracy
on
foot
to
poison
my
mind
what
she
is
said
to
have
done
may
all
be
true
but
i
ca
help
searching
behind
her
actions
for
a
higher
motive
you
clear
matters
up
if
you
tell
me
frankly
how
it
is
that
you
come
into
the
picture
she
shrank
back
from
him
like
a
timid
child
controlling
himself
he
spoke
patiently
i
need
to
be
explicit
you
ought
to
hate
her
she
in
love
with
your
husband
when
a
few
hours
ago
it
was
a
case
of
warning
her
of
the
trap
she
was
walking
into
you
were
reluctant
to
give
the
signal
would
spare
us
you
said
why
should
you
and
i
and
yet
you
her
accomplice
it
was
you
whom
i
followed
it
was
you
who
when
you
got
me
into
this
room
tried
to
hold
me
at
the
revolver
she
buried
her
face
in
the
hollow
of
her
arm
her
voice
came
muffled
was
he
waited
for
her
to
say
more
she
made
no
sound
not
even
of
sobbing
was
a
dangerous
game
to
play
he
reminded
her
did
know
your
man
or
how
he
would
take
it
you
must
have
had
some
strong
motive
you
might
have
killed
me
without
even
intending
what
a
risk
you
ran
doing
a
thing
like
that
singlehanded
for
a
moment
when
i
first
entered
everything
was
touch
and
and
still
she
made
no
reply
the
fire
had
burned
low
he
emptied
coals
on
it
to
bridge
the
embarrassment
of
her
silence
he
went
over
to
the
window
pulling
aside
the
curtains
and
stood
gazing
out
at
the
glory
of
the
night
the
moon
rode
high
trees
were
clumped
and
motionless
the
crooning
of
waves
made
a
continual
lullaby
she
was
married
and
she
was
wasted
she
was
not
wanted
and
she
was
not
released
she
had
a
husband
who
refused
to
live
and
could
not
contrive
to
die
as
a
substitute
for
passion
she
had
tried
sainthood
it
had
not
satisfied
he
let
the
curtains
fall
turning
he
gazed
back
at
the
figure
bowed
in
the
of
firelight
her
golden
hair
had
broken
loose
it
poured
across
her
shoulders
and
gathered
at
her
feet
in
a
pool
at
the
moment
she
looked
more
a
magdalene
than
a
saint
and
this
was
the
woman
who
had
made
men
brave
by
her
purity
to
whom
a
nation
had
turned
in
its
agony
a
flood
of
pity
swept
over
him
poor
narrow
shoulders
to
have
borne
such
a
burden
poor
virgin
feet
to
have
come
so
long
a
journey
poor
mortal
hands
to
have
given
such
a
blessing
she
had
been
robbed
and
cast
aside
the
cruelty
of
idealists
she
was
their
victim
what
did
they
attain
idealists
slew
happiness
on
the
altar
of
dreams
that
a
future
happiness
might
result
from
it
though
their
dreams
were
mistaken
they
lost
nothing
they
snatched
their
sensation
of
godlike
righteousness
but
who
could
restore
the
happiness
of
others
which
their
frenzy
had
destroyed
if
this
time
varensky
had
had
the
decency
to
die
she
was
free
he
himself
could
take
her
but
would
she
want
him
he
had
no
attractions
all
that
he
could
offer
would
be
to
serve
her
he
could
place
her
back
on
her
pinnacle
of
fame
instead
of
crowds
he
would
be
her
only
worshiper
would
that
satisfy
a
woman
who
had
been
a
saint
for
a
day
he
could
promise
her
rest
and
protection
he
could
take
her
feet
in
his
hands
and
guide
them
over
rough
places
and
if
she
wanted
to
be
a
woman
crossing
the
room
on
tiptoe
he
stood
over
her
sinking
to
his
knee
he
placed
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
you
look
up
i
not
here
to
hurt
you
i
would
even
judge
you
life
been
when
she
gave
no
sign
he
spoke
again
a
man
and
a
stranger
you
a
wife
but
you
told
me
so
much
you
wounded
you
ca
go
on
by
she
moved
he
knew
now
that
she
was
listening
that
door
in
the
wall
we
were
going
to
find
perhaps
found
it
let
me
be
your
friend
it
would
be
foolish
and
wrong
for
me
to
tell
you
that
i
she
raised
her
head
her
hair
fell
back
and
her
eyes
gazed
out
at
him
with
hungry
intensity
say
it
she
implored
if
he
dead
if
i
can
bring
you
sure
proof
for
answer
she
pressed
his
hand
against
her
bosom
vii
he
seated
himself
at
her
feet
his
arms
clasped
about
his
knees
as
if
crouched
before
a
how
much
meaning
had
she
read
into
his
implied
confession
he
felt
happy
happier
than
ever
before
in
his
life
and
yet
if
she
were
the
cause
of
his
happiness
the
odds
were
all
against
him
she
had
promised
him
nothing
she
could
promise
him
nothing
all
he
knew
of
her
was
what
she
had
told
him
his
elation
might
prove
to
be
no
more
than
an
emotion
that
would
fade
in
the
chill
light
of
morning
would
be
foolish
and
wrong
for
me
to
tell
you
the
words
had
risen
to
his
lips
unpremeditated
he
had
not
realized
that
he
cared
for
her
until
they
were
uttered
he
had
merely
felt
an
immense
compassion
an
overwhelming
desire
to
comfort
her
that
he
should
care
for
her
at
all
was
preposterous
it
was
paying
her
no
compliment
love
that
was
worth
the
having
required
a
more
permanent
incentive
than
physical
beauty
her
mind
and
her
character
were
a
riddle
to
him
if
his
passion
was
no
passing
mood
and
she
were
indeed
a
widow
it
would
be
her
mind
and
her
character
that
he
might
one
day
marry
he
ought
to
have
foreseen
that
something
of
this
sort
would
be
sure
to
happen
between
a
man
and
woman
left
alone
after
midnight
but
the
triumphant
self
whom
she
had
roused
in
him
grinned
impudently
at
this
cautious
moralizing
he
gloried
in
the
magnificent
unwisdom
of
his
indiscretion
he
was
surprised
and
delighted
at
this
capacity
for
recklessness
when
experience
was
growing
stale
he
had
broken
through
limitations
and
found
himself
gazing
on
an
unguessed
landscape
where
adventure
commenced
afresh
he
could
still
feel
the
softness
of
her
flesh
against
his
hand
that
sudden
act
of
tenderness
had
altered
all
their
relations
he
glanced
up
at
her
shyly
she
too
was
dreaming
her
lips
were
smiling
uncertainly
there
was
a
brooding
expression
in
her
eyes
the
blackness
of
her
mourning
merged
with
the
shadows
making
her
seem
disembodied
all
he
could
see
distinctly
was
the
golden
torrent
of
her
hair
framing
the
pallor
of
her
face
knelt
to
you
in
petrograd
i
do
people
it
did
them
no
good
i
never
want
any
one
else
to
do
i
kneel
to
you
i
crouch
at
your
would
rather
be
loved
than
she
restrained
him
gently
until
i
may
love
i
kneel
to
ought
to
find
me
repellent
no
let
me
speak
i
own
to
you
that
married
and
here
i
sit
with
you
alone
not
knowing
whether
my
husband
lives
or
is
buried
i
must
be
wicked
more
wicked
than
i
guessed
ivan
was
right
he
used
to
tell
me
i
played
satan
to
him
these
hands
which
look
so
soft
and
white
are
cruel
this
face
which
seems
so
gentle
is
a
lie
this
hair
which
makes
a
pillow
for
your
head
is
a
snare
one
good
man
has
already
cast
me
aside
rather
than
love
me
he
preferred
death
and
you
are
good
how
near
i
came
to
killing
you
she
bent
over
him
taking
his
face
between
her
hands
do
you
understand
she
had
drawn
his
head
back
against
her
knees
her
lips
all
but
touched
him
he
could
feel
the
fanning
of
her
breath
her
voice
came
pantingly
as
though
she
dreaded
her
own
question
can
you
see
in
me
eyes
like
a
glimpse
of
me
can
i
see
he
stared
up
adoringly
woman
who
still
a
child
a
woman
who
been
cheated
a
woman
whose
arms
are
empty
a
woman
who
sits
outside
a
tomb
dreaming
of
of
life
she
corrected
softly
being
allowed
to
live
for
a
me
perhaps
she
smiled
vaguely
knowing
what
kind
of
a
man
i
am
you
know
me
she
sat
upright
gazing
straight
before
her
do
even
know
why
i
brought
seems
strange
to
tell
you
now
it
seems
like
a
forgotten
sadness
so
forgotten
that
it
might
belong
to
some
one
else
and
yet
once
it
hurt
i
brought
you
that
i
might
win
back
my
husband
do
stiffen
look
up
and
see
how
i
smiling
i
was
never
his
in
your
sense
i
was
an
image
in
a
niche
whose
hands
he
kissed
i
was
a
mascot
bringing
him
good
luck
the
woman
part
of
me
he
postponed
superstitiously
till
his
cause
should
be
won
it
will
never
be
won
he
warned
you
before
he
married
you
she
shook
her
head
made
sure
of
me
at
first
i
was
proud
to
be
included
in
his
sacrifice
then
failure
made
it
all
absurd
i
was
sorry
for
him
i
knew
only
one
way
to
comfort
him
but
because
he
had
failed
he
became
the
more
determined
to
deny
himself
instead
of
comforting
him
i
became
his
tempter
then
santa
hindwood
pulled
himself
together
and
bent
forward
glowering
into
the
fire
ca
understand
all
this
talk
of
sacrifice
it
sounds
so
confoundedly
unpractical
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
your
husband
idea
of
virtue
was
to
abstain
from
everything
that
makes
life
worth
living
he
did
profit
any
one
by
abstaining
all
he
did
was
to
narrow
himself
if
he
wanted
to
be
an
ascetic
why
could
he
have
done
the
thing
thoroughly
and
played
the
game
there
was
no
need
to
drag
you
into
was
no
need
she
assented
quietly
to
have
me
and
to
withstand
me
made
him
appear
more
dedicated
he
tantalized
himself
with
the
thought
of
me
and
used
me
as
a
knife
with
which
to
gash
himself
i
was
a
part
of
the
road
to
calvary
he
was
treading
in
order
that
russia
might
be
saved
it
gratified
his
pride
to
make
the
road
spectacular
then
when
we
were
in
exile
and
he
was
no
longer
a
power
santa
came
the
ruthless
idealist
his
very
perhaps
but
i
should
call
her
an
is
an
idealist
who
to
gain
her
ends
stoops
to
any
baseness
she
an
avenging
angel
beautiful
and
sinister
she
one
of
the
few
revolutionaries
who
knows
what
she
wants
because
she
knows
she
gets
it
varensky
never
knew
his
head
was
in
the
clouds
he
lost
sight
of
his
purpose
in
a
mist
of
does
she
want
as
he
asked
the
question
he
glanced
back
at
her
where
she
gleamed
like
a
phantom
wants
there
was
a
pause
during
which
the
only
sound
was
the
struggle
of
the
distant
surf
wants
to
make
men
pay
for
what
they
do
to
children
all
her
crimes
she
a
mother
robbed
of
her
young
in
her
own
fierce
way
she
taken
all
the
children
of
the
world
to
her
men
do
do
she
caught
his
tone
of
puzzlement
yes
each
generation
commits
ferocious
sins
against
the
coming
generation
that
ca
protect
itself
it
children
who
pay
for
wars
and
every
social
injustice
men
live
like
a
marauding
army
pillaging
the
land
between
birth
and
death
they
pass
on
and
leave
to
children
the
settlement
of
their
reckless
debts
take
this
latest
war
five
million
children
in
europe
alone
are
dying
of
starvation
at
this
moment
santa
marked
down
the
men
who
are
responsible
for
their
suffering
silently
one
by
one
she
drugs
them
with
her
beauty
and
exacts
the
rogovich
he
was
raising
funds
for
a
new
where
do
i
come
in
you
said
that
you
brought
me
here
to
help
you
win
your
in
love
with
ivan
to
be
loved
by
santa
is
like
witnessing
the
signature
to
one
death
warrant
perhaps
she
a
bolshevik
agent
the
only
people
to
whom
the
bolsheviks
are
merciful
are
children
perhaps
she
really
in
love
with
him
she
plays
with
him
like
a
cat
with
a
he
indifferent
as
he
is
to
every
woman
yet
because
treacherous
and
he
wants
to
die
he
takes
her
with
him
on
many
of
his
journeys
i
hoped
that
if
i
could
give
you
to
her
she
might
spare
him
that
was
before
i
knew
you
i
was
beside
myself
with
suspense
ivan
has
been
gone
so
long
to
do
her
bidding
seemed
like
giving
him
his
last
chance
of
life
she
in
danger
and
in
hiding
you
the
one
person
who
can
prove
her
guilt
i
thought
that
if
i
put
you
in
her
power
i
place
her
under
an
obligation
so
that
now
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
forgive
me
it
your
safety
that
counts
not
he
knelt
against
her
plucking
her
hands
aside
at
me
he
commanded
long
as
your
husband
lives
his
safety
comes
first
in
saving
me
you
might
betray
him
if
in
snatching
our
happiness
we
connived
at
his
death
his
shadow
would
always
stand
between
us
i
still
your
prisoner
i
not
taken
back
my
parole
here
your
he
drew
it
from
his
pocket
and
laid
it
on
her
knees
your
me
to
ivan
already
he
may
be
we
know
we
play
the
game
by
when
she
hesitated
he
added
would
be
friends
with
any
woman
who
could
be
her
hands
groped
after
the
revolver
and
found
it
forcing
back
her
tears
she
answered
would
i
with
any
rising
to
his
feet
he
helped
her
to
rise
me
to
viii
as
they
stepped
into
the
garden
the
first
restlessness
of
morning
was
in
the
air
the
moon
had
vanished
stars
were
going
out
along
the
low
level
of
dawn
cast
a
sickly
shadow
it
was
as
though
night
were
an
indigo
curtain
behind
which
silver
forms
were
moving
she
led
the
way
across
the
lawn
through
a
door
in
the
wall
and
out
on
the
short
crisp
turf
she
had
thrown
a
cloak
about
her
and
pulled
the
hood
over
her
head
it
made
her
look
cowled
and
elfin
it
was
the
hour
when
everything
is
fantastic
he
had
an
oppressive
sense
of
unreality
as
though
this
were
all
a
dream
from
which
he
would
shortly
rouse
he
stood
aloof
from
recent
happenings
and
surveyed
his
share
in
them
in
an
elderly
derisive
fashion
what
were
all
these
promises
that
he
had
been
exchanging
like
a
gallant
he
tried
to
recall
his
exact
words
to
what
extent
had
he
committed
himself
he
had
crossed
the
atlantic
that
he
might
multiply
his
fortune
for
no
other
reason
he
was
neither
an
idealist
nor
a
sentimentalist
he
had
realized
the
chance
that
a
bankrupt
europe
offered
and
had
come
to
take
advantage
of
it
what
would
these
derelicts
of
the
catastrophe
think
of
him
if
they
guessed
his
real
purpose
they
were
willfully
even
contemptibly
unpractical
yet
their
perverted
unselfishness
troubled
his
conscience
to
spend
half
one
years
in
exile
like
the
little
grandmother
might
not
correct
injustice
but
at
least
it
was
a
brave
protest
to
plan
to
die
like
varensky
because
he
had
failed
to
rescue
humanity
was
a
counsel
of
despair
but
it
had
its
gleam
of
nobility
to
assassinate
like
santa
men
whose
statesmanship
you
did
not
comprehend
was
the
madness
of
a
zealot
but
she
at
least
staked
her
life
against
theirs
into
none
of
these
undertakings
did
profit
enter
it
was
disquieting
to
find
himself
among
people
so
determined
to
convert
the
world
to
altruism
the
world
had
been
like
this
always
it
would
be
like
this
to
the
end
if
they
were
once
to
sense
who
he
was
they
would
regard
him
as
their
enemy
he
was
walking
into
danger
with
his
eyes
wide
open
his
wisest
plan
would
be
to
sink
into
the
shadows
and
take
the
first
train
back
to
sanity
to
do
that
he
would
have
to
leave
her
and
why
not
what
did
he
owe
her
what
was
she
to
him
she
belonged
to
another
man
waiting
for
him
to
die
or
to
make
sure
of
his
death
might
prove
a
tedious
business
a
humiliating
one
most
certainly
and
yet
to
leave
her
now
she
had
been
going
on
ahead
or
was
it
his
steps
that
had
been
lagging
she
had
halted
as
he
came
up
he
felt
the
firm
surface
of
the
road
beneath
his
tread
in
the
gloom
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
you
promised
too
much
that
determined
him
keep
my
promises
he
answered
shortly
walking
side
by
side
they
struggled
on
against
the
mass
of
vagueness
it
seemed
like
a
strong
gray
tide
pressing
on
their
breasts
against
which
they
made
no
headway
what
was
to
be
the
upshot
of
it
she
was
guiding
him
to
santa
his
lips
twisted
it
would
take
more
than
santa
to
inspire
him
with
terror
england
was
the
jungle
a
man
could
disappear
unnoticed
supposing
in
the
next
santa
were
to
do
away
with
him
what
would
she
gain
by
it
she
would
have
silenced
his
testimony
in
the
affair
but
she
would
have
added
to
the
evidence
if
she
were
the
woman
she
was
painted
she
would
be
too
wary
to
do
that
no
she
would
not
attempt
to
kill
him
then
what
was
her
urgency
gradually
night
was
fading
the
paleness
from
the
sea
was
spreading
it
drove
like
smoke
in
billowy
banks
of
vapor
creeping
low
along
the
ground
live
things
were
waking
in
separate
plaintive
warnings
birds
were
calling
across
the
road
ahead
rabbits
scurried
against
the
formless
vacancy
of
sky
the
rounded
shoulders
of
the
uplands
became
discernible
he
took
notice
of
their
direction
she
was
leading
him
to
the
abandoned
camp
she
started
sorry
it
was
the
only
name
i
knew
to
call
you
what
do
they
usually
she
came
close
like
a
child
and
stood
gazing
up
at
him
he
stooped
and
spoke
gently
a
wild
rose
once
more
let
me
look
into
your
eyes
it
so
strange
that
you
should
care
for
strange
to
me
she
said
he
placed
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
something
that
i
want
you
to
remember
if
harm
comes
to
either
of
us
believe
always
that
it
was
only
good
that
i
you
brought
me
would
be
good
she
murmured
wish
it
he
tumbled
the
hood
back
so
that
he
could
see
her
hair
a
man
loves
a
woman
who
already
married
it
does
often
bring
happiness
it
would
be
right
that
it
should
it
is
our
fault
that
this
has
happened
but
it
will
be
if
we
misuse
sha
misuse
something
he
groped
after
his
words
i
came
to
you
i
been
foolish
there
no
sense
in
regretting
if
i
had
been
foolish
we
should
have
met
i
thought
that
i
was
following
santa
you
can
guess
she
inclined
her
head
there
one
thing
more
if
your
husband
comes
back
promise
me
you
she
strained
against
him
so
their
lips
were
nearly
touching
she
spoke
fiercely
and
again
though
it
years
and
you
his
hands
slipped
from
her
shoulders
lower
and
lower
till
his
arms
closed
about
her
he
whispered
it
only
for
a
moment
poor
tired
little
through
the
ghostly
twilight
of
the
autumn
dawn
they
entered
the
deserted
camp
before
one
of
the
hutments
she
halted
and
tapped
she
tapped
again
there
was
no
answer
cautiously
raising
the
latch
she
peered
into
the
room
beckoning
to
him
she
slipped
across
the
threshold
ix
the
hut
was
empty
the
floor
was
deep
in
dust
the
ceiling
was
meshed
with
cobwebs
nailed
across
the
window
just
as
the
soldiers
had
left
it
a
dingy
curtain
hung
striking
a
match
he
held
it
above
his
head
at
the
far
end
he
made
out
signs
of
occupancy
on
a
shelf
was
a
loaf
of
bread
and
near
by
a
pitcher
in
a
corner
spread
on
the
bare
boards
for
a
bed
was
a
wrap
he
stooped
it
was
santa
cloak
of
sables
the
match
went
out
he
turned
long
has
she
been
here
the
time
she
knew
she
was
knew
she
was
suspected
at
plymouth
what
made
her
motor
all
across
england
to
this
he
glanced
round
with
pity
at
the
forlornness
wanted
to
be
it
would
be
better
to
tell
the
road
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
considered
there
are
more
people
in
it
he
said
at
last
just
the
few
that
i
have
met
it
an
organization
i
might
have
guessed
there
are
the
people
who
helped
the
little
old
lady
to
visit
me
undetected
there
are
the
people
who
entered
my
room
in
my
absence
there
the
foreign
gentleman
who
could
speak
english
who
called
for
santa
in
his
car
but
if
this
hut
is
on
the
road
out
why
was
she
delaying
you
she
was
risking
her
freedom
every
second
why
for
me
anna
before
he
had
given
her
time
to
answer
his
mind
had
leaped
to
a
new
conjecture
if
she
captured
suddenly
the
tragedy
of
this
strange
woman
revolutionary
avenger
of
children
became
vivid
her
pain
stung
him
as
though
he
had
suffered
it
himself
he
lived
again
the
hunted
hours
that
must
have
been
hers
while
she
had
listened
in
this
dusty
room
he
remembered
her
fascination
the
grayness
of
her
eyes
the
fastidiousness
of
her
dress
what
a
contrast
to
these
surroundings
how
often
she
must
have
crouched
by
that
window
watching
from
behind
the
shabby
curtain
for
the
approach
of
the
pursuer
the
men
she
had
killed
did
not
matter
probably
they
had
deserved
their
death
his
pity
was
reserved
for
her
she
had
been
the
pampered
darling
of
princes
her
whims
had
been
commands
to
lovers
who
themselves
were
rulers
no
present
had
been
too
costly
to
purchase
the
ecstasy
of
her
complaisance
her
body
had
been
a
jewel
guarded
coveted
irrepeatable
in
its
beauty
crimes
had
been
committed
for
its
possession
and
this
was
her
end
he
heard
in
memory
the
hoarse
pleading
of
her
voice
trying
vainly
to
convince
him
that
love
could
make
her
good
the
woman
at
his
side
was
speaking
heard
no
sound
she
was
armed
if
they
tried
to
take
her
she
have
defended
his
thoughts
came
back
night
yes
if
they
taken
her
in
the
garden
but
they
might
have
known
she
would
be
armed
perhaps
they
followed
her
if
they
traced
her
to
this
hut
they
might
have
waited
till
she
was
sleeping
she
shook
her
head
is
that
she
grown
tired
of
delaying
gone
by
the
road
he
frowned
the
second
time
you
used
the
phrase
ca
you
tell
me
plainly
it
not
too
late
i
show
she
darted
out
of
the
hut
when
he
joined
her
in
the
open
she
was
waiting
impatiently
to
secure
the
door
behind
him
the
moment
it
was
fastened
she
set
off
at
a
run
she
raced
like
a
boy
with
none
of
a
woman
awkwardness
with
an
occasional
backward
glance
up
the
long
deserted
avenue
of
the
camp
she
fled
at
first
he
was
content
to
follow
for
the
pleasure
he
had
in
watching
her
she
was
so
swift
and
young
she
was
like
a
deer
in
her
slenderness
sudden
eagerness
had
transformed
her
the
hood
had
slipped
back
to
her
shoulders
the
wind
of
her
going
fluttered
in
her
hair
outside
the
camp
she
bore
to
the
left
in
a
direction
leading
further
afield
over
gorse
and
bracken
dew
had
flung
a
silver
net
the
turf
was
a
tapestry
sewn
with
jewels
larks
were
springing
up
the
keen
fragrance
of
seaweed
mingled
with
the
honeyed
perfumes
of
the
land
he
caught
up
with
her
he
panted
she
had
no
breath
to
waste
in
words
turning
on
him
a
flushed
and
laughing
face
she
pointed
ahead
just
short
of
the
where
the
sheer
drop
began
she
sank
to
her
knees
clasping
her
breast
while
she
recovered
he
gazed
about
him
he
discovered
no
sign
of
the
thing
she
was
pursuing
the
sea
was
blanketed
in
mist
above
the
blurred
horizon
the
red
eye
of
the
sun
stared
at
him
from
the
foot
of
the
cliff
came
the
lapping
of
waves
no
other
sound
she
had
risen
he
was
about
to
speak
she
pressed
a
finger
to
her
lips
taking
him
by
the
hand
she
led
him
to
the
edge
at
first
as
he
gazed
down
he
saw
only
the
crumbling
face
of
the
chalk
then
he
made
out
a
winding
path
descending
it
seemed
no
broader
than
a
track
that
a
goat
might
follow
is
it
she
dragged
excitedly
on
his
arm
distinctly
above
the
lapping
of
waves
he
heard
the
click
of
oars
working
in
beneath
the
fog
a
vessel
was
hiding
it
had
dropped
a
boat
which
was
pulling
toward
the
land
road
out
she
whispered
santa
she
nodded
not
so
difficult
as
it
looks
it
was
used
by
smugglers
we
use
it
she
broke
off
oars
were
being
shipped
the
prow
grounded
there
was
a
muttering
of
men
voices
some
sort
of
discussion
a
pause
then
oars
were
put
out
again
the
rowing
recommenced
growing
fainter
and
fainter
x
gone
she
pressed
against
him
in
her
gladness
seeing
the
relief
in
her
eyes
he
questioned
does
this
mean
to
you
anna
else
mean
you
think
that
santa
had
received
word
of
your
husband
and
that
that
was
why
do
want
to
think
or
mean
i
only
want
to
feel
it
as
though
been
living
in
a
prison
and
the
door
had
been
flung
wide
i
was
one
of
them
they
condemned
me
in
their
hearts
they
despised
me
i
was
too
weak
i
could
bear
their
she
clenched
her
hands
against
her
cheeks
till
the
knuckles
showed
white
the
good
of
being
crucified
it
so
much
better
to
live
and
be
glad
for
santa
he
asked
she
going
what
will
happen
to
her
she
raised
her
face
she
be
hounded
and
hunted
she
getting
too
well
known
prince
rogovich
thought
he
recognized
her
she
be
always
escaping
rushing
from
hiding
to
hiding
till
one
day
to
have
been
loved
so
much
and
to
be
pushed
out
of
life
behind
the
mist
they
heard
the
creak
of
ropes
running
over
pulleys
a
gasoline
engine
was
started
for
an
instant
the
shadow
of
a
trawler
loomed
through
the
wall
of
opaqueness
the
tiller
was
thrust
over
she
vanished
they
stood
very
silently
listening
and
watching
in
imagination
hindwood
followed
the
vessel
course
it
was
not
of
the
vessel
he
was
thinking
but
of
the
woman
on
board
her
have
been
loved
so
much
and
to
be
pushed
out
of
life
if
he
had
had
the
chance
what
could
he
have
done
for
her
she
had
fascinated
him
but
he
had
not
loved
her
she
was
past
reclaiming
love
with
a
woman
of
her
kind
would
have
meant
passion
nothing
more
a
fierce
flame
a
slow
degrading
of
an
emotion
that
was
fine
yet
he
was
filled
with
pity
and
unreasoning
remorse
some
day
her
enemies
would
overtake
her
good
respectable
men
like
major
cleasby
the
good
men
who
by
the
injustice
of
their
prejudices
had
made
her
what
she
was
a
chapter
ended
he
said
quietly
slipping
his
arm
through
hers
as
though
she
already
belonged
to
him
he
was
turning
inland
toward
the
peace
of
the
rolling
country
when
his
step
was
arrested
he
caught
the
sound
of
labored
breathing
and
the
rattle
of
sliding
chalk
hands
groped
above
the
edge
of
the
cliff
searching
for
a
holding
they
were
followed
by
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
man
with
a
face
intensely
white
in
which
a
pair
of
pale
green
eyes
smoldered
lower
down
and
out
of
sight
a
woman
spoke
the
voice
was
santa
chapter
the
fifth
the
green
eyes
cast
a
spell
i
hindwood
stood
rooted
to
the
ground
he
had
thrust
anna
behind
him
she
was
tugging
at
his
hand
with
the
tenacity
of
terror
he
scarcely
dared
breathe
while
he
watched
the
man
dragging
himself
inch
by
inch
to
safety
to
go
to
his
assistance
might
cause
his
death
any
move
that
startled
him
might
fling
him
back
over
the

in
falling
he
would
sweep
away
the
unseen
woman
who
must
be
clinging
to
the
face

him
to
hindwood
it
seemed
that
he
was
present
at
a
fantastic
rehearsal
of
the
day
of
resurrection
when
the
last
trumpet
blew
it
would
probably
be
precisely
in
some
such
fashion
that
the
sea
would
give
up
its
dead
it
would
happen
about
sunrise
when
mankind
was
still
abed
it
would
commence
very
quietly
when
clouds
were
hanging
low
and
the
first
of
the
barnyard
cocks
were
crowing
without
warning
graves
would
open
and
all
the
tired
people
who
had
been
so
long
resting
would
begin
to
stir
like
the
sound
of
falling
rain
they
would
patter
through
the
drowsing
country
searching
for
their
ancient
dwellings
at
first
they
would
walk
alone
then
in
groups
later
in
crowds
by
the
time
the
living
looked
out
of
their
windows
there
would
be
no
standing
room
on
earth
across
seas
and
oceans
the
drowned
would
come
swimming
they
would
wade
through
waves
and
clamber
up
cliffs
just
as
this
man
was
doing
the
vision
became
so
probable
that
hindwood
glanced
behind
him
to
make
sure
that
it
was
not
happening
in
a
shimmering
expanse
of
dew
and
autumn
coloring
lay
the
sweet
green
landscape
of
living
men
the
kindly
hedgerows
the
sheltering
valleys
the
friendly
villages
everything
was
gentle
and
unaltered
it
was
only
at
this
barrier
which
the
stranger
was
struggling
to
surmount
that
the
tranquillity
ended
at
its
brink
eternity
commenced
a
pulsating
oblivion
of
mist
and
grayness
across
which
the
rising
sun
peered
curiously
the
stranger
was
too
occupied
with
his
danger
to
be
aware
that
he
was
being
observed
clutching
at
tufts
and
digging
with
his
fingers
he
was
easing
himself
out
of
the
abyss
little
by
little
he
was
gaining
ground
till
at
last
pulling
his
knees
clear
of
the
edge
he
sprawled
exhausted
on
the
turf
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
twisting
about
still
lying
flat
he
reached
down
to
his
companion
as
she
appeared
he
retreated
steadying
her
efforts
and
dragging
her
with
him
side
by
side
they
collapsed
breathing
heavily
and
staring
in
dazed
defiance
at
the
death
they
had
avoided
hindwood
made
a
step
to
approach
them
he
found
himself
tethered
anna
was
gazing
up
at
him
silently
imploring
her
hair
seemed
a
mass
of
solid
gold
weighing
her
down
the
blue
veins
in
her
temples
stood
out
beneath
her
fairness
her
throat
was
and
stretched
back
her
lips
were
parted
revealing
the
coral
of
her
mouth
it
was
as
though
she
had
been
caught
from
behind
by
an
assailant
and
brutally
jerked
back
with
little
endearing
motions
she
caressed
hindwood
hand
he
tried
to
fathom
her
necessity
in
the
presence
of
her
weakness
there
was
nothing
that
he
would
not
have
granted
the
man
with
the
green
eyes
had
recovered
in
the
act
of
rising
he
had
caught
sight
of
them
his
jaw
had
dropped
open
if
it
was
possible
his
complexion
had
gone
a
shade
whiter
his
expression
bore
testimony
to
the
medley
of
his
emotions
the
chief
of
which
was
astonishment
he
made
an
oddly
pathetic
figure
with
his
scratched
hands
and
torn
clothing
crouching
in
that
hunted
attitude
he
had
lost
his
hat
in
the
ascent
his
brown
hair
was
lank
with
perspiration
he
was
a
lean
man
and
graceful
as
a
greyhound
even
in
his
present
ungainly
posture
there
was
a
hint
of
something
swift
and
gallant
in
his
bearing
one
forgot
that
he
was
a
vagabond
who
had
eluded
formalities
and
completed
an
illegal
landing
he
looked
more
like
a
champion
unhorsed
in
a
tourney
his
brow
was
wide
and
noble
but
the
top
of
his
head
was
shaped
like
a
deformity
and
rose
into
a
point
like
a
dunce
cap
his
eyes
were
and
piercing
they
penetrated
with
a
sense
of
power
his
mouth
was
and
sensitive
too
sensitive
for
a
man
his
face
was
narrow
and
smooth
as
a
girl
he
had
a
haggard
appearance
of
perpetual
suffering
which
the
extremeness
of
his
pallor
served
to
enhance
he
was
indefinably
tragic
he
might
have
sat
equally
well
for
a
portrait
of
lucifer
or
of
harlequin
overtaken
by
his
folly
very
wearily
he
lifted
himself
from
the
ground
and
stumbled
toward
them
as
he
did
so
santa
uttered
a
nervous
cry
and
turned
after
which
she
watched
broodingly
what
happened
paying
no
attention
to
hindwood
the
man
made
straight
for
anna
bending
over
her
humbly
he
whispered
unintelligible
words
her
terror
left
her
making
no
sound
she
raised
to
him
eyes
eloquent
with
compassion
did
he
say
hindwood
questioned
she
was
prepared
to
reply
when
the
stranger
stayed
her
with
a
gesture
was
apologizing
in
russian
for
having
hindwood
glanced
at
the
ragged
edge
of
the
cliff
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
apology
scarcely
necessary
you
to
be
congratulated
you
seem
to
have
recognized
this
lady
who
are
you
the
stranger
drew
himself
erect
a
grim
smile
played
about
his
mouth
varensky
at
your
illustration
ii
hindwood
stared
at
him
with
a
frown
he
was
contrasting
this
ivan
varensky
with
the
leader
of
men
whose
deeds
of
three
years
ago
had
so
deeply
stirred
him
one
picture
stood
out
ineffaceably
it
was
of
a
sea
of
soldiers
patriotism
forgotten
arms
flung
away
in
wild
retreat
and
of
ivan
varensky
driving
forward
alone
as
though
he
by
his
single
courage
could
turn
back
the
enemy
and
this
was
the
man
the
white
knight
of
russia
the
the
magician
of
words
had
he
met
him
three
years
ago
he
would
have
knelt
to
him
now
all
he
could
do
was
to
frown
it
was
necessary
to
say
something
he
spoke
gruffly
chosen
an
odd
method
of
returning
we
had
news
you
were
was
the
green
eyes
narrowed
i
always
nearly
dying
is
that
so
anna
and
then
i
come
back
this
last
time
as
you
observed
i
had
the
discourtesy
to
forget
i
was
thinking
of
santa
actually
i
struggled
to
survive
believe
me
that
unlike
the
forbearance
of
his
manner
was
rebuking
making
an
effort
to
be
genial
hindwood
held
out
his
hand
a
strange
way
to
meet
long
been
your
admirer
it
was
a
close
call
as
close
as
a
man
could
varensky
winced
as
the
powerful
grip
closed
about
his
fingers
they
were
long
and
pointed
more
like
a
woman
than
a
man
close
call
he
smiled
american
it
was
not
for
me
i
could
tell
you
but
perhaps
one
day
when
i
become
past
history
anna
will
do
as
he
mentioned
his
wife
he
gave
her
a
look
at
once
tender
and
furtive
a
look
which
acknowledged
without
rancor
the
truth
of
the
situation
she
started
forward
but
his
eyes
held
her
she
stopped
you
return
she
said
chokingly
however
often
you
know
that
i
glad
it
the
certainty
that
i
shall
lose
you
that
however
often
you
return
i
shall
never
have
you
she
bowed
her
head
from
the
edge
of
the
cliff
without
a
trace
of
emotion
the
other
woman
watched
her
tilting
her
face
with
his
bruised
fingers
varensky
regarded
her
earnestly
if
i
was
aware
of
that
and
then
be
side
by
side
but
always
separate
they
moved
across
the
downs
there
was
no
backward
glance
hindwood
followed
them
with
his
eyes
till
they
sank
into
a
hollow
the
last
he
saw
was
the
raw
gold
of
her
hair
and
the
conical
top
of
his
pointed
head
growing
more
distant
above
the
bracken
iii
and
i
too
have
to
apologize
i
failed
to
keep
my
he
swung
round
at
the
mockingly
spoken
words
to
find
that
santa
had
stolen
up
behind
him
until
now
he
had
had
no
time
to
notice
her
his
anger
was
so
intense
that
it
held
him
silent
after
all
that
she
had
done
and
had
intended
to
do
to
him
she
had
the
effrontery
to
jest
did
she
think
that
he
was
as
much
her
dupe
as
the
fool
who
had
died
for
her
in
the
woods
of
vincennes
but
his
anger
was
and
left
him
sternly
cold
she
was
changed
her
fastidious
elegance
was
a
thing
of
the
past
she
was
commonly
attired
as
any
her
cheap
blouse
was
rent
at
the
neck
its
sleeves
were
stained
and
in
tatters
her
rough
skirt
had
been
nearly
trodden
off
she
was
tom
and
disheveled
she
had
suffered
even
more
from
her
adventure
than
had
varensky
her
hat
lay
crushed
at
her
feet
in
the
grass
with
her
wounded
hands
she
doing
her
best
to
twine
the
thick
coils
of
her
hair
into
place
she
stood
confessed
for
what
she
was
a
fugitive
from
justice
the
wildness
of
the
landscape
made
a
fitting
setting
she
looked
startlingly
untamed
she
might
have
passed
for
a
peasant
ophelia
except
that
her
gray
eyes
were
calm
and
her
manner
nonchalant
are
a
good
many
things
besides
missing
your
appointment
for
which
you
have
to
can
explain
he
cut
her
short
you
and
me
no
explanations
are
she
jerked
back
her
head
flattening
her
hands
against
her
sides
like
a
soldier
standing
at
attention
not
he
took
his
time
to
answer
you
nothing
to
her
face
went
white
then
flamed
scarlet
as
though
he
had
struck
her
with
his
open
palm
to
you
she
spoke
slowly
santa
gorlof
am
nothing
to
you
you
the
first
man
to
whom
i
ever
offered
my
heart
i
would
lie
down
in
the
mud
that
you
might
walk
over
me
let
you
beat
me
like
a
dog
if
i
might
only
follow
you
i
starve
that
you
might
be
fed
go
thirsty
that
you
might
drink
break
my
body
that
you
might
not
suffer
i
would
die
if
it
would
give
you
seeing
that
her
rhetoric
was
having
no
effect
she
sank
her
voice
i
could
have
escaped
i
waited
for
you
i
risked
my
freedom
for
one
last
sight
of
she
clutched
at
her
breast
choking
down
a
sob
you
tell
me
that
i
nothing
to
you
he
was
determined
to
remain
unmoved
by
her
emotion
regarding
her
stonily
he
asked
right
had
you
to
believe
that
you
were
anything
to
me
she
laughed
forlornly
right
at
i
had
ever
cared
for
you
he
continued
your
present
predicament
it
would
all
be
she
raised
her
brows
contemptuously
see
i
found
out
the
sort
of
woman
you
sort
i
recall
he
turned
away
searching
hollows
and
clumps
of
bushes
for
bobbing
heads
of
watchers
her
captors
might
be
closing
in
on
her
her
indifference
to
her
danger
was
disconcerting
with
eyes
still
fixed
on
the
distant
landscape
he
revealed
his
thoughts
talk
of
love
is
paltry
it
tragic
farce
you
have
a
husband
you
liable
to
be
jailed
at
any
he
expected
she
would
retort
when
she
maintained
silence
he
glanced
down
at
his
feet
ashamed
of
what
he
felt
himself
compelled
to
tell
her
if
it
were
true
and
if
your
affection
were
desired
you
have
no
love
to
offer
nothing
that
is
you
is
yours
your
hours
are
numbered
your
body
and
your
life
are
forfeit
the
man
who
is
your
husband
is
leading
the
against
you
if
you
think
you
can
persuade
me
to
go
to
the
scaffold
for
you
rid
yourself
of
the
thought
there
be
no
repetition
of
the
woods
of
vincennes
the
victim
in
that
case
was
your
lover
i
he
met
her
eyes
never
deceived
me
for
a
second
from
the
moment
we
left
the
i
knew
who
it
was
had
pushed
prince
rogovich
you
knew
she
asked
quietly
did
you
have
me
arrested
was
none
of
my
you
were
kind
after
we
landed
at
the
hotel
you
arranged
to
breakfast
with
could
bring
myself
to
believe
you
were
yet
after
you
had
believed
you
followed
me
to
detective
he
spoke
testily
she
said
it
wistfully
her
face
softened
followed
me
because
even
against
your
will
you
still
cared
for
me
you
pitied
me
you
were
chivalrous
you
refused
to
condemn
me
unheard
you
hoped
there
was
some
mistake
you
followed
me
to
make
you
made
me
he
rapped
out
the
words
you
insist
on
the
truth
i
came
to
seafold
hoping
to
find
you
innocent
if
i
had
i
should
have
fought
for
you
whereas
she
prompted
nervously
found
you
done
to
me
what
you
done
to
every
other
man
who
ever
befriended
you
betrayed
me
and
had
me
lured
into
an
ambush
where
for
all
i
know
you
given
orders
for
me
to
be
you
thanks
to
you
your
husband
was
ahead
of
you
hidden
in
the
bushes
waiting
for
you
if
we
had
given
the
signal
that
warned
you
you
gave
she
spoke
triumphantly
trapped
you
and
yet
you
did
want
me
to
be
caught
to
have
shown
generosity
at
a
moment
when
you
thought
that
i
was
threatening
your
life
you
must
still
have
been
fond
of
he
drew
back
from
her
revolted
by
her
insincerity
left
no
room
for
thought
you
were
diabolically
explicit
you
knew
that
i
could
prove
your
guilt
you
meant
to
kill
me
in
order
that
i
might
be
her
eyes
filled
she
stretched
out
her
arms
beseechingly
they
fell
hopelessly
as
he
retreated
from
her
misjudge
me
she
implored
a
woman
who
finished
a
woman
as
you
reminded
me
whose
hours
are
numbered
my
body
and
my
life
are
forfeit
it
true
what
you
said
nothing
that
i
am
belongs
to
me
if
you
like
to
put
it
that
way
i
a
woman
who
has
nothing
to
offer
and
yet
i
love
you
the
first
man
with
whom
i
was
ever
in
love
now
when
it
too
late
you
do
believe
me
you
thinking
of
the
many
others
let
it
pass
i
had
to
see
you
once
more
i
could
come
to
you
you
were
surrounded
by
my
enemies
to
persuade
you
to
come
to
me
i
had
to
trick
you
until
it
was
safe
to
visit
you
i
had
to
have
you
held
by
force
i
compelled
anna
madame
varensky
to
he
made
an
impatient
gesture
i
wondering
to
how
many
men
you
made
that
speech
before
i
heard
all
about
your
appeals
to
chivalry
if
you
were
a
man
unfortunately
you
not
so
i
have
a
sentimental
compunction
about
abandoning
you
what
are
your
plans
when
i
saw
the
ship
i
hoped
you
had
you
came
back
why
was
landing
from
the
boat
that
had
been
sent
to
take
me
she
was
laying
claim
to
some
obscure
nobility
making
a
final
bid
for
his
admiration
mist
clearing
he
said
brusquely
another
be
visible
for
miles
if
you
seen
here
you
be
think
not
she
smiled
languidly
it
was
her
arch
mysterious
way
of
smiling
that
had
first
attracted
him
do
you
go
she
whispered
in
her
hoarse
parched
voice
loathe
and
despise
me
you
grudge
me
every
moment
we
together
i
done
what
was
right
i
willing
to
pay
the
penalty
i
earned
a
rest
i
tired
you
ca
guess
how
now
that
she
wanted
him
to
go
he
gazed
at
her
with
a
new
interest
if
the
trackers
were
hot
upon
his
trail
what
would
be
his
sensations
would
he
be
able
to
be
courteous
and
to
talk
calmly
whatever
might
be
her
crimes
she
had
courage
what
if
it
were
true
that
by
some
tortuous
process
of
reasoning
she
did
actually
believe
she
had
done
right
and
what
if
it
were
true
that
she
had
intended
him
no
harm
but
had
only
attempted
to
win
him
by
violence
the
uneasy
doubt
took
shape
in
his
mind
that
he
might
have
misjudged
her
it
would
be
a
splendid
memory
to
have
if
she
were
wrongly
executed
this
gleaming
morning
the
larks
singing
the
sky
the
valiant
sun
the
dew
and
himself
fleeing
from
the
forlornness
of
a
woman
every
man
hand
was
against
her
she
believed
she
had
done
right
he
regarded
her
less
coldly
she
was
perfect
as
on
the
day
when
all
europe
had
gone
wild
over
her
and
this
masterpiece
of
loveliness
which
had
been
known
as
santa
gorlof
was
doomed
to
be
destroyed
she
stamped
her
foot
hysterically
torture
he
faced
her
obstinately
are
you
proposing
you
some
plan
in
mind
madame
called
this
road
out
is
it
possible
for
you
to
take
it
know
a
shorter
certain
leave
me
you
must
leave
me
i
a
woman
who
has
nothing
to
offer
you
a
man
who
has
everything
to
he
squared
his
lips
do
like
the
sound
of
this
shorter
route
i
want
to
know
more
about
as
he
made
a
step
toward
her
she
dodged
and
broke
from
him
dashing
toward
the
cliff
on
the
very
edge
he
caught
her
she
struggled
dangerously
but
he
stumbled
back
with
her
crushed
against
him
little
fool
she
lay
quiet
her
face
pressed
against
his
cheek
then
she
fell
to
sobbing
difference
would
it
make
why
would
you
let
me
do
it
iv
why
would
he
it
was
the
question
he
himself
was
asking
he
had
done
nothing
humane
in
preventing
her
he
had
merely
spared
his
own
feelings
if
she
had
succeeded
he
would
have
found
himself
in
an
ugly
situation
he
would
have
been
suspected
of
a
crime
similar
to
hers
there
would
have
been
no
evidence
to
hang
him
but
he
could
never
have
established
his
innocence
he
looked
down
at
the
woman
shuddering
in
his
arms
for
all
the
world
as
though
he
were
her
lover
he
had
been
within
an
ace
of
inheriting
her
isolation
did
let
you
do
it
he
hesitated
then
he
took
the
plunge
i
intend
to
save
she
stirred
she
glanced
up
at
him
as
her
eyes
met
his
their
expression
of
wonder
gave
way
to
one
of
gratitude
she
strove
to
reach
his
lips
but
he
restrained
her
me
you
you
help
how
much
she
implied
oy
me
he
did
not
stop
to
question
no
time
to
he
spoke
hurriedly
the
safest
place
of
hiding
old
one
a
hut
know
he
interrupted
go
ahead
to
make
sure
the
way
is
clear
you
follow
at
a
distance
keep
me
in
sight
if
i
look
back
take
without
more
ado
he
turned
away
retracing
his
steps
to
the
camp
he
attempted
to
walk
jauntily
like
a
who
had
risen
early
to
enjoy
the
first
freshness
of
the
morning
here
and
there
he
stooped
to
pluck
a
blackberry
he
pulled
a
sprig
of
heather
for
his
lapel
he
flattered
himself
that
if
he
were
being
watched
his
conduct
was
artistically
normal
for
all
his
display
of
carelessness
he
advanced
warily
there
was
nothing
in
the
billowy
expanse
of
greenness
that
escaped
him
somewhere
within
a
radius
of
four
miles
the
major
was
waiting
to
make
his
pounce
he
might
be
crouched
in
the
next
patch
of
bracken
he
might
be
lying
behind
the
nearest
mound
the
dapper
old
gentleman
who
bore
such
a
striking
resemblance
to
lord
roberts
assumed
the
terror
of
nemesis
in
his
imagination
he
seemed
everywhere
and
nowhere
he
would
pop
up
suave
and
neatly
bespatted
at
the
moment
when
he
was
least
expected
he
gazed
straight
before
him
not
daring
to
look
back
but
he
never
lost
consciousness
of
the
fateful
woman
following
him
stealthily
as
a
shadow
and
always
there
was
the
memory
of
the
other
woman
with
the
gentle
eyes
and
shining
hair
he
reached
the
camp
it
looked
lonely
as
a
graveyard
rows
of
hutments
bleached
to
a
bluish
whiteness
gleamed
in
the
morning
sunshine
the
downs
curled
above
it
like
an
emerald
wave
on
the
point
of
breaking
passing
along
the
bare
avenue
of
silent
dwellings
he
pushed
open
the
door
of
santa
place
of
refuge
tiptoeing
across
the
dusty
floor
he
knelt
by
the
window
peering
out
seconds
ticked
into
minutes
ten
minutes
elapsed
twenty
half
an
hour
there
was
no
sign
of
life
he
strove
to
calm
his
fears
if
she
had
been
caught
it
simplified
matters
but
such
arguments
failed
to
pacify
him
he
pictured
her
as
he
had
seen
her
on
the
a
splendid
animal
proud
fastidious
mildly
contemptuous
and
then
as
he
had
seen
her
that
morning
broken
desperate
defiant
out
there
in
the
happy
sunshine
they
might
be
carrying
her
away
they
would
drag
her
through
the
public
streets
as
a
criminal
they
would
lock
her
in
a
cell
they
would
hale
her
to
a
court
to
be
gaped
at
they
would
paw
over
her
private
life
they
would
pry
into
the
intimacies
of
her
nothing
that
was
hers
would
be
sacred
then
when
the
sport
grew
tedious
an
old
man
turned
moralist
by
reason
of
decrepitude
would
don
a
black
cap
and
intrust
her
to
the
mercy
of
almighty
god
he
staged
her
arrest
as
though
he
had
seen
it
happen
he
had
strolled
straight
through
her
pursuers
ambush
they
had
let
him
pass
directly
she
had
appeared
they
had
risen
out
of
the
brush
twisting
her
arms
behind
her
they
had
snapped
handcuffs
on
her
slender
wrists
she
had
struggled
sinking
to
the
ground
faint
with
terror
they
had
jerked
her
to
her
feet
half
carrying
her
pushing
her
forward
he
raged
impotently
what
brutes
men
were
nothing
that
she
had
done
to
his
sex
was
bad
enough
he
thrust
the
vision
from
him
each
time
it
returned
the
door
creaked
he
leaped
as
if
he
had
been
shot
she
pressed
a
finger
to
her
lips
coming
close
so
that
he
could
feel
the
rise
and
fall
of
her
bosom
here
she
whispered
v
who
she
was
puzzled
by
his
stupidity
then
know
she
murmured
saw
me
in
the
distance
and
started
to
run
toward
me
i
dropped
to
my
knees
and
circled
approaching
the
hut
from
the
he
could
have
recognized
on
my
saw
no
one
hindwood
forehead
wrinkled
as
he
reckoned
the
cost
he
comes
alone
we
can
deal
with
mean
she
did
not
finish
her
sentence
he
smiled
sternly
thinking
how
far
he
had
drifted
from
his
moorings
what
made
you
ask
my
her
answer
was
enigmatic
they
held
their
breath
she
was
clinging
to
him
there
had
been
no
sound
nothing
that
could
have
warned
them
pushing
her
from
him
he
stole
toward
the
window
not
fifty
yards
away
rigid
like
a
hound
at
fault
stood
the
major
slowly
scarcely
turning
his
head
he
was
running
his
eye
along
the
double
line
of
hutments
there
was
nothing
in
his
expression
that
would
tell
what
he
had
found
as
though
he
sensed
that
he
was
watched
he
started
forward
at
a
rambling
pace
he
tried
no
doors
he
peered
through
no
panes
his
bearing
was
that
of
a
mildly
interested
tourist
who
had
stumbled
on
the
camp
by
accident
he
passed
out
of
sight
inoffensively
idly
slashing
at
the
grass
it
was
some
time
before
either
of
them
dared
to
whisper
then
hindwood
straightened
himself
and
drew
back
return
she
said
tragically
he
returns
alone
what
of
it
may
catch
does
follow
we
may
catch
him
her
eyes
grew
long
and
narrow
like
a
cat
would
we
do
with
him
she
asked
softly
he
regarded
her
warily
told
me
he
loved
you
he
said
irrelevantly
would
stand
in
his
way
nothing
personal
for
what
he
holds
to
be
right
he
mutilate
himself
he
kill
the
thing
he
loved
she
sank
her
voice
all
he
paused
and
began
again
idealists
like
the
major
yourself
and
varensky
human
relations
do
count
that
was
what
you
were
trying
to
tell
me
was
it
to
achieve
individual
ideals
sacrifice
your
own
and
everybody
her
expression
became
wooden
as
an
idol
sacrifice
mine
for
instance
when
she
refused
to
answer
he
made
his
inquiry
more
intrusive
life
perhaps
no
obligation
of
loyalty
or
gratitude
would
hinder
you
be
he
recognized
the
struggle
which
his
words
had
occasioned
her
sleepy
look
had
vanished
she
believed
he
was
preparing
to
desert
her
she
was
mustering
the
courage
to
invent
a
falsehood
already
her
hands
were
lying
they
were
wandering
over
him
patting
and
caressing
he
clasped
them
in
his
own
holding
her
at
arm
length
her
eyes
met
his
they
grew
steady
and
absorbed
him
though
you
were
all
i
had
if
your
life
caused
suffering
to
children
i
would
kill
he
laughed
at
her
solemnity
over
having
told
the
truth
you
it
children
with
the
major
it
patriotism
with
varensky
it
freedom
with
me
it
nothing
i
follow
no
which
is
lucky
for
you
you
terribly
tired
get
some
rest
while
you
can
i
watch
i
no
idealist
you
can
trust
vi
she
had
wrapped
herself
in
her
sable
cloak
and
curled
herself
on
the
floor
in
the
corner
remotest
from
the
window
when
he
judged
she
was
sleeping
he
stole
to
her
side
and
stood
gazing
down
her
rags
were
hidden
except
for
the
weary
disorder
of
her
hair
she
was
almost
the
fashionable
beauty
of
his
atlantic
voyage
he
looked
closer
fatigue
had
uncovered
something
hidden
in
her
countenance
traces
of
lost
girlhood
her
body
seemed
smaller
her
features
less
decided
the
mask
of
intrigue
had
fallen
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
slim
pathetic
child
whom
the
major
had
discovered
swaying
like
in
the
perfumed
dusk
of
the
hindoo
temple
her
feet
peeped
out
from
beneath
the
costly
fur
such
doll
feet
so
little
to
have
come
so
long
a
journey
her
ankles
were
cut
by
the
climb
up
the
cliff
her
shoes
were
broken
as
though
the
curtain
had
gone
up
in
the
theater
of
his
brain
her
feet
began
to
act
their
story
he
saw
them
tiny
and
brown
pattering
about
the
shaded
bungalow
where
the
english
had
lived
with
her
burmese
mother
he
saw
them
lost
and
wandering
along
the
roads
of
india
he
saw
them
in
the
temple
flashing
like
a
swallow
flight
across
mosaic
pavements
he
followed
all
their
progress
as
they
carried
her
through
triumphs
and
bereavements
to
this
moment
she
sighed
and
moved
languidly
the
robe
fell
back
revealing
her
hands
they
were
grazed
and
wounded
pouring
water
on
his
handkerchief
from
the
pitcher
he
bathed
them
gently
just
as
he
had
finished
she
opened
her
eyes
wo
leave
me
find
me
sitting
here
he
assured
her
like
this
when
you
smiling
faintly
she
drowsed
off
obediently
as
a
child
all
day
she
lay
huddled
in
the
corner
oblivious
and
spent
with
exhaustion
this
must
be
the
first
long
sleep
she
had
snatched
for
several
days
and
nights
crouched
beside
the
window
he
guarded
her
the
major
might
return
varensky
might
send
help
he
himself
could
do
nothing
till
after
nightfall
the
only
food
was
the
broken
loaf
of
bread
on
the
shelf
beside
the
pitcher
he
did
not
dare
to
touch
it
when
she
woke
she
would
be
hungry
the
downs
poured
in
a
steady
blaze
of
light
a
fly
drummed
against
the
panes
on
distant
hillsides
sheep
were
grazing
he
envied
them
their
freedom
he
could
go
if
he
liked
as
the
monotony
dragged
on
the
temptation
strengthened
he
was
under
no
obligation
to
make
himself
an
outlaw
if
he
were
to
slip
away
he
would
not
rouse
her
within
the
hour
he
could
be
speeding
up
to
london
once
there
he
would
be
of
importance
the
one
man
at
least
in
some
statesmen
estimate
who
could
solve
the
european
situation
for
this
woman
he
was
sacrificing
the
happiness
of
millions
the
fleshpots
of
egypt
could
be
his
for
the
claiming
if
he
stayed
and
she
were
arrested
he
would
be
held
as
her
accomplice
and
altruism
urged
him
to
escape
he
owed
nothing
to
her
women
had
always
been
for
him
an
enemy
country
forbidden
and
enticing
they
had
been
what
darkest
africa
was
to
the
explorer
a
of
treacherous
loveliness
in
imagination
he
had
always
been
approaching
their
borders
fascinated
by
the
gleam
of
uplifted
faces
but
like
varensky
whose
life
was
a
constant
challenging
of
terror
in
this
one
matter
he
had
been
cowardly
since
the
first
false
woman
of
his
early
manhood
why
was
it
this
sudden
clamor
to
possess
the
thing
which
all
his
years
he
had
avoided
was
it
because
he
felt
the
rising
tide
of
loneliness
and
knew
that
the
years
were
gaining
on
him
all
this
autumn
day
as
the
silver
clearness
of
morning
faded
into
the
deep
gold
of
afternoon
he
sat
motionless
considering
up
to
now
he
had
maintained
his
pride
flattering
himself
that
it
was
he
who
was
doing
the
refusing
he
had
told
himself
arrogantly
that
he
would
succeed
first
succeed
immensely
after
that
he
could
have
any
woman
for
the
asking
but
could
he
he
was
losing
his
faculty
for
sharing
merely
to
marry
a
woman
was
not
to
win
her
the
illusion
of
ecstasy
he
glanced
over
to
the
corner
where
she
lay
sleeping
she
was
the
symbol
of
the
feminine
half
of
the
world
whom
he
had
disregarded
it
was
she
who
had
roused
him
with
her
parched
voice
and
instinctive
passion
he
studied
her
her
golden
face
her
cruel
lips
her
thin
sweet
profile
he
noticed
the
delicate
firmness
of
her
arms
the
fineness
of
her
throat
the
tenderness
of
her
molding
at
every
point
she
made
him
aware
of
his
incompleteness
across
the
downs
like
a
fisherman
drawing
in
his
nets
the
sun
was
setting
the
hut
was
vague
with
dusk
like
the
crescent
of
a
young
moon
santa
had
wakened
and
was
rising
vii
you
promised
to
save
will
if
i
she
knotted
her
hands
in
mental
anguish
must
any
moment
he
may
return
have
you
thought
of
nothing
leaning
across
his
shoulder
she
lifted
the
ragged
curtain
peering
out
at
the
fading
landscape
as
she
gazed
her
face
stiffened
and
her
eyes
became
fixed
in
a
leaden
stare
not
more
than
thirty
yards
distant
with
his
back
toward
them
the
major
was
standing
he
had
followed
their
trail
still
closer
ca
escape
she
panted
be
there
all
night
can
stop
here
and
trust
rising
stealthily
leaving
the
door
ajar
behind
him
he
slipped
out
of
the
hut
in
the
twilight
he
halted
breathing
in
the
sweet
evening
fragrance
without
further
secrecy
he
strode
toward
the
major
evening
i
been
expecting
at
the
first
word
the
major
spun
round
alertly
on
the
defensive
have
your
prisoner
he
continued
found
i
had
no
taste
for
being
added
to
her
list
of
victims
i
be
glad
if
you
take
her
off
my
hands
she
in
he
jerked
his
thumb
across
his
shoulder
the
major
eyed
him
fiercely
mean
you
were
expecting
me
hindwood
laughed
caught
sight
of
you
last
night
in
varensky
garden
and
this
morning
on
the
downs
i
did
let
you
know
because
there
were
things
i
was
anxious
to
instance
purpose
of
her
you
satisfied
yourself
the
risk
of
my
life
yes
when
you
warned
me
against
being
romantic
i
thought
you
were
merely
jealous
fortunately
or
unfortunately
whichever
way
you
like
to
put
it
i
know
now
that
everything
you
told
me
was
the
major
twirled
his
mustaches
thoughtfully
in
the
last
of
the
daylight
he
looked
like
a
lean
white
cat
his
coolness
began
to
wear
on
hindwood
nerves
suppose
your
men
are
hidden
let
make
an
have
no
the
major
spoke
slowly
forget
that
this
woman
is
my
wife
i
wished
to
spare
her
as
much
as
possible
by
making
the
arrest
myself
his
eyes
narrowed
shrewdly
did
you
manage
to
secure
her
she
had
an
accident
it
too
long
a
story
she
ca
get
away
i
through
i
done
my
as
he
turned
to
go
the
older
man
stretched
out
a
delaying
hand
his
iron
discipline
wavered
not
a
cheerful
task
if
you
be
so
good
as
to
stay
you
feel
like
that
dare
allow
myself
to
feel
it
something
i
owe
my
as
though
afraid
that
he
would
weaken
the
major
set
out
at
a
run
across
the
turf
outside
the
hut
he
waited
as
hindwood
caught
up
with
him
he
whispered
men
against
one
woman
for
an
old
soldier
it
is
he
was
on
the
point
of
entering
when
he
felt
himself
flung
violently
forward
hindwood
arm
was
crooked
about
his
throat
shutting
off
his
breath
bursting
into
the
hut
he
was
hurled
to
the
floor
and
found
himself
struggling
in
the
darkness
he
was
being
pressed
down
and
down
a
voice
spoke
the
accents
of
which
a
minute
ago
had
been
friendly
the
door
get
something
to
bind
him
anything
that
will
hold
tear
strips
off
your
viii
it
was
over
the
major
had
been
trussed
and
gagged
he
had
been
handcuffed
with
his
own
manacles
his
revolver
had
been
removed
and
his
pockets
searched
he
leaned
propped
against
the
wall
like
a
jointed
doll
his
body
making
an
exact
right
angle
with
his
legs
the
angry
vigilance
of
his
eyes
was
his
only
sign
of
life
there
was
no
means
of
making
a
light
even
if
it
had
been
safe
to
employ
it
now
that
the
fight
was
ended
they
sat
staring
into
the
gloom
anonymous
as
three
shadows
it
was
hindwood
who
broke
the
silence
been
guilty
of
an
outrage
major
i
guess
that
what
you
like
to
tell
me
but
you
gave
me
no
choice
where
i
come
from
women
and
children
are
held
sacred
it
was
up
to
some
man
to
protect
he
paused
instinctively
as
though
he
expected
a
reply
he
looked
to
santa
where
she
crouched
motionless
and
scarcely
discernible
in
her
corner
what
were
they
thinking
this
husband
and
wife
so
brutally
reunited
his
sense
of
discomfort
urged
him
to
continue
run
off
with
the
idea
that
i
approve
of
what
she
done
and
not
in
love
with
her
if
she
were
a
man
i
do
suppose
i
raise
a
finger
to
save
her
but
she
a
woman
inconsistently
that
makes
all
the
difference
i
could
stand
for
seeing
her
dragged
away
to
the
kind
of
shame
again
he
paused
the
lack
of
response
was
maddening
scrambling
to
his
feet
he
bent
over
the
major
be
frank
now
that
i
got
you
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
you
if
you
promise
to
keep
quiet
i
remove
the
santa
had
not
stirred
in
the
darkness
she
was
little
more
than
a
voice
me
speak
while
he
forced
to
listen
put
him
where
i
can
see
taking
his
prisoner
by
the
shoulders
hindwood
dragged
him
to
the
window
with
a
jerk
he
tore
the
ragged
curtain
from
its
nails
the
downs
were
a
sea
of
purple
dusk
the
moon
hung
like
a
lantern
in
an
unruffled
sky
against
the
square
of
glass
the
major
face
showed
she
spoke
softly
you
remember
when
last
we
parted
on
the
docks
at
calcutta
it
hurt
since
then
we
both
gone
down
the
ladder
for
both
of
us
it
was
the
end
of
goodness
i
must
have
known
it
i
waved
till
long
after
you
were
out
of
sight
then
i
wept
till
my
heart
was
shriveled
up
how
long
i
waited
to
tell
you
what
you
made
me
suffer
you
made
me
feel
that
i
never
been
your
wife
only
a
plaything
but
you
put
a
white
soul
into
my
body
it
was
a
greater
wickedness
than
anything
i
have
done
now
that
what
you
made
me
father
of
my
dead
child
you
seek
me
out
to
be
my
her
hoarse
voice
died
away
like
the
protest
of
an
uneasy
conscience
the
major
handcuffs
clinked
together
think
that
you
just
she
began
again
come
of
a
race
which
admires
justice
ah
but
justice
is
not
kindness
you
knew
what
i
was
when
you
brought
me
from
the
temple
a
wanton
what
had
i
learned
of
righteousness
it
was
for
my
virtue
that
you
bought
me
it
was
for
my
pomegranate
lips
my
golden
body
my
little
caressing
hands
afterward
as
an
incentive
to
desire
it
pleased
you
to
bring
the
soul
into
my
eyes
you
made
me
long
to
be
perfect
you
seemed
so
strong
and
wise
i
wanted
to
be
like
you
without
you
i
was
afraid
you
were
my
god
i
felt
brave
when
i
touched
her
voice
sank
the
little
one
came
i
was
no
longer
frightened
he
was
so
nearly
white
he
was
yours
and
mine
my
blood
seemed
cleansed
i
saw
the
world
through
the
innocence
of
his
eyes
the
evil
of
the
east
ceased
to
call
to
me
but
when
he
was
killed
and
you
put
me
from
you
murderer
of
a
woman
faith
she
addressed
the
silent
face
soul
in
me
was
she
rocked
in
the
shadows
crimes
are
yours
and
you
came
to
condemn
me
you
robbed
me
of
everything
but
my
body
my
heart
was
famished
to
feed
it
i
sold
my
beauty
at
a
price
at
first
for
men
money
then
for
their
honor
at
last
for
their
she
had
risen
wonder
why
for
their
lives
they
were
men
like
you
outwardly
just
who
destroyed
belief
in
goodness
because
of
men
like
you
women
hearts
are
broken
and
children
go
hindwood
leaped
to
his
feet
blocking
her
path
she
leaned
past
him
staring
down
into
the
bandaged
face
husband
without
pity
god
whom
i
worshipped
i
burn
in
hell
because
of
your
slipping
to
her
knees
she
came
into
the
square
of
light
i
not
beautiful
is
there
another
like
me
would
it
not
have
been
happier
to
have
been
kind
see
what
you
have
ix
there
was
the
rustling
of
footsteps
in
the
grass
outside
letting
in
a
flood
of
moonlight
the
door
was
pushed
gently
open
we
enter
without
waiting
for
a
reply
a
man
padded
noiselessly
across
the
threshold
by
his
peaked
head
and
the
litheness
of
his
body
hindwood
recognized
him
as
varensky
behind
him
with
the
mildness
of
attendant
angels
anna
and
the
little
grandmother
followed
just
inside
the
room
he
halted
this
the
bound
face
in
the
square
of
window
had
riveted
his
attention
why
hindwood
spoke
again
had
come
to
take
her
to
be
the
pale
face
smiled
contemptuously
only
a
way
of
dying
was
that
any
reason
for
making
him
suffer
without
further
argument
taking
command
of
the
situation
he
stepped
quickly
to
the
major
side
stooping
he
cut
the
bonds
and
removed
the
gag
free
free
to
go
where
you
like
and
to
get
us
all
into
trouble
we
shall
be
here
for
at
least
an
hour
so
you
have
time
i
landed
without
permission
in
your
england
this
morning
that
a
cause
for
police
interference
my
name
ivan
the
major
rose
painfully
blinking
at
the
lean
stranger
as
though
he
had
discovered
in
him
a
jester
are
still
the
handcuffs
he
muttered
when
the
handcuffs
had
been
knocked
off
repeated
free
to
the
major
shook
himself
and
resumed
his
strutting
air
like
a
brave
old
rooster
who
had
all
but
had
his
neck
wrung
it
makes
no
difference
i
with
his
left
eye
shut
and
his
head
on
one
side
varensky
regarded
him
comically
difference
it
may
you
a
secret
service
agent
a
revolutionary
you
uphold
laws
i
defy
them
you
the
servant
of
force
i
hate
every
form
of
compulsion
what
difference
it
makes
depends
on
yourself
whether
you
propose
to
stay
as
a
spy
or
as
a
man
of
a
sportsman
who
abides
by
the
rules
of
the
varensky
shrugged
his
narrow
shoulders
a
sportsman
who
hunts
women
he
turned
tenderly
to
santa
famished
we
cover
up
the
window
and
make
a
when
candles
which
they
had
brought
had
been
kindled
and
the
meal
spread
santa
and
hindwood
sat
down
on
the
floor
facing
each
other
while
they
ate
there
was
dead
silence
hindwood
kept
catching
glimpses
of
her
eyes
what
was
to
be
the
end
of
her
her
expression
was
stunned
they
both
knew
what
this
silence
betokened
when
the
meal
was
over
her
fate
was
to
be
decided
he
was
aware
of
each
separate
personality
as
though
each
were
making
an
effort
to
explain
itself
what
was
to
be
hoped
for
from
the
verdict
of
such
a
jury
every
one
in
the
hut
except
anna
and
himself
was
a
fanatic
he
did
not
try
to
see
their
faces
all
he
saw
was
their
hands
as
they
ministered
to
him
the
hands
of
varensky
half
clown
half
martyr
the
wrinkled
hands
of
the
old
noblewoman
worn
with
service
who
had
lived
with
outcasts
and
spent
her
years
in
exile
the
hands
of
anna
guilty
with
yearning
varensky
spoke
without
looking
up
it
was
as
though
he
were
carrying
on
a
conversation
already
started
ca
restore
life
so
what
right
have
we
to
destroy
it
to
be
merciful
that
the
only
his
green
eyes
sought
the
major
could
have
killed
you
but
we
did
have
you
wondered
why
by
letting
you
go
put
ourselves
in
your
power
you
can
drag
us
all
to
jail
you
a
hard
man
you
exact
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
you
came
here
to
exact
a
life
if
we
had
judged
you
by
your
own
standards
we
should
have
been
justified
in
giving
you
no
quarter
if
we
had
what
good
would
it
have
done
you
only
have
been
dead
and
if
you
managed
to
capture
santa
what
good
would
that
have
done
to
have
had
her
executed
would
have
made
her
a
better
he
reached
out
and
took
her
unwilling
hand
bending
back
the
fingers
one
by
one
beautiful
see
how
cleverly
they
work
there
not
a
scientist
living
can
reproduce
their
mechanism
no
one
knows
how
they
grew
to
be
like
his
tone
became
tender
been
bad
she
been
treacherous
and
cruel
a
faithless
wife
and
a
menace
merely
to
punish
her
would
undo
her
evil
only
she
can
do
for
the
first
time
the
major
spoke
what
are
you
driving
varensky
made
no
attempt
to
answer
him
he
seemed
not
to
have
heard
he
sat
on
the
floor
folding
and
unfolding
santa
fingers
while
his
grotesque
shadow
squatted
on
the
wall
behind
him
he
looked
like
a
kindly
embarrassed
boy
trying
to
say
something
to
the
sulky
girl
so
that
it
should
not
sound
too
wounding
wonder
whether
santa
husband
ever
saw
a
woman
when
she
was
dead
there
no
light
in
her
eyes
she
ca
say
that
she
sorry
last
week
i
saw
hundreds
in
the
ditches
about
kiev
they
were
lovely
we
must
let
our
santa
become
like
he
turned
to
the
major
with
a
slow
smile
we
you
would
like
to
think
of
the
woman
you
had
loved
the
major
took
a
step
into
the
room
and
stood
biting
his
lips
glooming
down
at
varensky
and
i
sir
view
our
duty
from
hostile
standpoints
i
care
for
this
woman
infinitely
more
than
you
can
ever
care
but
i
care
still
more
for
my
country
she
betrayed
it
a
score
of
times
shall
i
because
i
am
her
husband
stand
by
and
allow
her
to
betray
it
had
i
accomplished
the
purpose
that
brought
me
here
my
heart
would
have
been
broken
to
have
put
handcuffs
on
her
wrists
and
to
have
sworn
away
her
life
do
you
think
it
would
have
cost
me
nothing
the
very
judge
who
sentenced
her
would
have
shunned
the
little
grandmother
looked
up
she
spoke
gruffly
what
would
have
been
the
use
of
your
suffering
society
would
have
been
revenged
it
would
have
washed
its
hands
like
pontius
pilate
it
would
have
smiled
smugly
believing
she
was
wrong
and
it
was
right
it
would
have
gone
on
its
way
manufacturing
more
criminals
like
her
the
old
evils
that
have
made
her
what
she
is
would
have
continued
while
she
she
snapped
her
fingers
furiously
the
women
in
the
ditches
about
when
the
room
had
grown
silent
varensky
covered
the
major
with
his
mocking
stare
must
excuse
our
little
grandmother
she
feels
these
things
intensely
more
than
half
her
years
have
been
spent
in
the
major
pulled
himself
together
needs
no
excusing
what
is
it
that
you
want
of
me
x
santa
life
it
of
no
use
to
he
smiled
in
the
midst
of
his
earnestness
a
boy
begging
for
a
broken
watch
you
were
going
to
throw
it
away
i
have
dreams
that
i
could
repair
the
major
twitched
irritably
you
talk
like
a
boy
how
can
i
give
you
what
does
belong
to
me
at
every
port
in
europe
the
police
are
watching
for
me
to
forgive
her
would
help
it
is
against
me
that
she
offended
it
against
the
laws
of
varensky
nodded
soothingly
only
one
of
the
many
agents
of
social
vengeance
what
i
ought
to
have
asked
you
was
to
give
me
the
part
of
her
life
that
does
belong
to
you
she
in
your
clutches
let
her
escape
keep
silent
and
drop
your
if
i
do
varensky
tucked
his
legs
closer
under
him
and
bent
forward
i
could
turn
her
into
a
a
note
of
passionate
pleading
crept
into
his
voice
loves
children
it
was
how
her
wickedness
started
she
was
blind
and
mistaken
and
all
her
crimes
were
committed
for
children
a
woman
who
loves
children
must
be
good
she
done
abominable
things
she
could
become
magnificent
if
she
would
do
good
with
an
equal
the
major
glanced
at
the
subject
of
these
prophecies
sitting
in
their
midst
rebelliously
silent
he
said
wearily
words
you
offer
me
no
proof
the
white
face
seemed
to
grow
till
it
filled
the
room
the
green
eyes
glowed
like
emeralds
they
were
uncanny
and
hypnotic
language
came
in
a
torrent
is
her
body
it
her
soul
if
she
were
to
die
now
what
would
happen
to
her
i
tried
to
save
the
soul
of
a
nation
let
me
do
for
santa
what
i
could
do
for
russia
prove
that
mercy
restores
where
punishment
destroys
there
been
too
much
killing
the
world
grows
worse
instead
of
better
it
been
going
on
for
ages
this
hanging
and
guillotining
and
bludgeoning
it
reformed
nothing
it
the
might
is
right
of
the
jungle
the
justice
of
apes
and
cavemen
revenge
whether
it
carried
out
by
tooth
and
claw
or
by
and
armies
never
heals
anything
it
always
leaves
a
bruise
the
face
of
europe
is
bruised
beyond
recovery
by
our
last
display
of
justice
its
fields
are
rotten
with
corpses
shall
we
add
one
more
to
the
many
a
woman
he
paused
trembling
like
a
leaf
when
the
major
only
frowned
he
sank
back
exhausted
you
seen
what
i
seen
his
head
sagged
stupidly
seen
what
i
seen
miles
of
men
all
slaughtered
women
dead
of
starvation
children
hunting
in
packs
like
wolves
and
all
because
there
no
mercy
if
you
seen
you
could
kill
the
candles
ceased
to
gutter
shadows
huddled
motionless
the
very
silence
seemed
accused
hindwood
rose
he
could
endure
the
tension
no
longer
know
nothing
about
her
soul
and
not
much
about
her
guilt
all
i
know
is
that
a
woman
at
the
end
of
her
tether
who
been
handed
one
of
the
rawest
of
raw
deals
that
the
world
been
hard
on
her
wo
excuse
her
we
ca
alter
the
world
over
night
if
she
caught
as
she
may
be
at
any
moment
it
be
all
up
with
her
i
do
care
what
she
done
or
how
much
i
lose
by
it
i
not
going
to
stand
by
and
see
her
the
major
swung
round
am
i
but
how
to
avoid
it
hindwood
showed
his
suspicion
of
this
sudden
conversion
me
he
answered
cautiously
you
handed
in
any
reports
i
mean
officially
about
my
knowledge
of
santa
the
fact
that
you
crossed
on
the
same
boat
with
her
you
not
been
there
no
one
in
your
service
besides
yourself
who
has
the
least
idea
of
her
whereabouts
it
can
be
he
was
dimly
conscious
of
the
pale
expectancy
of
the
faces
lifted
up
to
him
he
felt
that
he
was
on
the
edge
of
a
whirlpool
into
which
he
was
being
slowly
dragged
even
at
this
last
moment
he
made
an
effort
to
resist
it
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
the
heart
of
its
eddies
he
saw
a
woman
she
grew
distinct
her
face
was
anna
me
explain
he
said
neither
humanitarian
nor
idealist
i
have
no
fantastic
hopes
of
turning
sinners
into
saints
i
head
of
a
group
of
american
financiers
and
i
in
europe
to
employ
its
starving
peoples
do
misunderstand
me
the
result
of
my
mission
may
be
philanthropic
but
its
purpose
is
to
make
a
profit
since
the
war
europe
become
a
where
everything
exposed

she
have
no
trouble
in
crossing
the
silence
that
greeted
his
offer
lengthened
at
a
loss
to
account
for
it
he
glanced
from
face
to
face
i
offended
it
was
santa
who
replied
leaping
up
in
their
midst
tattered
and
disheveled
she
threatened
them
like
dogs
whom
she
would
beat
aside
a
sob
caught
her
breath
it
impossible
even
for
you
who
call
yourselves
my
friends
to
believe
any
good
of
me
i
swear
before
heaven
he
has
no
love
for
xi
back
in
london
he
lost
no
time
in
completing
arrangements
for
departure
every
boat
that
left
for
france
without
him
lessened
chance
of
safety
and
yet
though
he
worked
frantically
canceling
appointments
and
clearing
up
correspondence
he
could
bring
home
to
himself
the
reality
of
the
situation
the
hut
on
the
downs
and
all
that
had
happened
there
seemed
something
that
he
had
read
or
imagined
only
the
face
of
anna
stood
out
in
memory
and
actual
it
seemed
impossible
to
believe
that
he
philip
hindwood
was
in
league
with
revolutionaries
that
he
was
in
league
was
proved
to
him
when
he
set
about
procuring
the
passport
and
visés
necessary
for
santa
to
accompany
him
by
the
time
he
obtained
them
he
had
abused
confidence
and
perjured
himself
beyond
hope
of
pardon
they
were
made
out
in
the
name
of
jones
spinster
subject
aged
thirty
years
confidential
secretary
to
philip
hindwood
whom
she
is
all
her
permits
were
marked
and
it
was
until
the
bustle
was
over
and
he
was
seated
in
the
train
for
dover
that
the
true
proportions
of
his
entanglement
dawned
on
him
at
dover
she
was
to
meet
him
that
had
been
the
understanding
from
then
on
day
in
day
out
he
would
never
be
without
her
no
matter
what
strange
country
he
traversed
she
would
sit
beside
him
reminding
him
of
his
complicity
in
her
crimes
he
would
have
to
talk
with
her
eat
with
her
pretend
to
consult
with
her
just
as
if
she
were
what
he
had
claimed
her
to
be
his
confidential
secretary
would
she
have
the
sense
to
act
discreetly
would
she
expect
him
to
make
love
to
her
he
glowered
out
of
the
window
at
the
fleeting
landscape
any
folly
was
possible
to
a
woman
with
her
record
what
made
him
most
furious
was
the
easy
way
in
which
he
had
allowed
her
to
twist
him
round
her
fingers
it
was
the
woods
of
vincennes
all
over
again
he
was
going
into
disordered
countries
where
governments
were
toppling
and
anarchy
was
rife
when
she
felt
herself
beyond
the
reach
of
danger
what
was
to
prevent
her
from
getting
rid
of
him
russia
if
he
got
so
far
was
the
kind
of
nightmare
in
which
anything
might
happen
in
russia
murder
was
one
of
the
fine
arts
he
remembered
anna
suspicion
that
santa
was
a
bolshevist
agent
it
added
nothing
to
his
comfort
he
had
given
way
to
idealism
it
was
the
madness
of
a
moment
it
was
listening
to
varensky
that
had
worked
the
mischief
varensky
had
said
something
about
idealism
what
was
it
that
idealism
was
the
vanishing
point
the
last
outpost
between
man
and
eternity
his
words
came
back
you
gaze
up
a
railroad
track
there
always
a
point
in
the
infinite
distance
where
just
before
they
vanish
the
parallel
rails
seem
to
join
if
a
train
were
ever
to
reach
that
point
it
would
mean
death
life
like
that
a
track
along
which
we
travel
on
the
parallel
rails
of
possibility
and
desire
the
lure
of
the
idealist
is
to
overtake
the
illusion
where
possibility
and
desire
seem
to
merge
and
the
safety
of
the
journey
for
him
the
safety
of
the
journey
had
ended
the
moment
it
had
started
if
varensky
had
meant
anything
by
the
vanishing
point
he
had
meant
that
death
is
the
unconscious
goal
of
all
idealists
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
seemed
highly
probable
when
you
took
santa
with
you
on
your
travels
the
smell
of
the
sea
was
in
the
air
they
were
slowing
down
grinding
their
way
to
the
docks
through
the
town
of
dover
he
did
want
to
see
her
he
would
make
no
effort
to
find
her
she
might
have
been
prevented
from
joining
him
perhaps
arrested
after
the
train
had
halted
he
took
his
time
no
one
whom
he
recognized
was
on
the
platform
directing
a
porter
to
attend
to
his
baggage
he
went
quickly
to
the
embarkation
office
to
get
his
permit
for
going
aboard
as
he
was
entering
he
felt
his
arm
touched
timidly
and
turned
see
you
you
expect
me
he
made
an
effort
to
act
courteously
course
there
are
formalities
to
be
gone
through
you
better
stick
close
to
me
do
attract
attention
let
me
do
the
they
fell
into
line
behind
a
queue
of
passengers
winding
slowly
toward
a
table
where
officials
were
receiving
and
inspecting
passports
he
stood
well
in
front
of
her
doing
his
best
to
hide
her
when
his
turn
came
and
the
official
held
out
his
hand
he
presented
her
passport
with
his
own
perfunctorily
and
my
the
official
was
on
the
point
of
returning
them
when
a
man
leaned
across
his
shoulder
and
whispered
something
both
of
them
looked
up
staring
hard
at
santa
is
miss
jones
the
official
asked
lady
at
my
you
miss
jones
an
american
citizen
before
she
could
reply
hindwood
had
interposed
already
told
you
she
miss
jones
if
you
look
you
see
that
her
passport
marked
as
well
as
the
two
men
consulted
together
in
lowered
tones
then
the
passport
was
and
restored
picking
it
up
together
with
the
embarkation
permits
hindwood
strolled
leisurely
towards
the
gangplank
directly
they
were
on
board
he
hurried
santa
to
her
cabin
and
shut
the
door
stay
here
till
we
sight
france
i
giving
no
one
else
the
opportunity
for
suspecting
a
chapter
the
sixth
the
escape
i
the
steamer
had
no
sooner
reached
calais
than
a
new
cause
for
alarm
presented
itself
during
the
channel
crossing
hindwood
had
been
keyed
up
to
the
last
point
of
tension
every
moment
he
had
expected
to
be
tapped
on
the
shoulder
and
informed
that
his
secretary
identity
had
been
discovered
he
had
spent
most
of
his
time
surreptitiously
mounting
guard
in
the
neighborhood
of
santa
cabin
if
the
same
man
chanced
to
pass
him
twice
he
had
at
once
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
being
shadowed
the
hesitancy
at
dover
over
santa
passport
had
robbed
him
of
whatever
sense
of
security
he
had
possessed
it
had
compelled
him
to
acknowledge
the
ruin
that
faced
him
should
he
be
exposed
while
engineering
the
flight
of
so
notorious
a
criminal
as
the
major
had
warned
him
she
was
being
sought
by
the
police
of
every
country
if
the
worst
should
happen
he
would
find
no
apologists
it
would
be
useless
for
him
to
plead
a
chivalrous
motive
she
had
been
the
lodestar
of
masculine
passions
too
often
though
he
managed
to
escape
a
prison
sentence
he
would
emerge
from
the
catastrophe
broken
in
character
a
paltry
creature
half
knave
half
fool
who
had
gambled
away
his
integrity
and
made
himself
a
laughing
stock
already
in
imagination
he
was
reading
the
scare
headlines
which
would
advertise
his
shame
to
the
world
he
would
be
regarded
as
a
malefactor
hustled
behind
bars
and
herded
for
trial
with
blackmailers
and
pickpockets
dogged
by
these
persistent
dreads
when
the
ship
was
inside
calais
harbor
he
rapped
on
her
door
and
having
heard
her
bid
him
enter
slipped
across
the
threshold
announcing
tersely
since
she
joined
him
he
had
held
no
conversation
with
her
she
made
no
attempt
to
break
through
his
silence
rising
obediently
while
she
adjusted
her
hat
she
watched
him
in
the
mirror
with
the
eyes
of
a
reproachful
dog
without
sign
or
sound
as
he
turned
away
impatiently
she
followed
no
sooner
did
they
appear
on
deck
than
the
new
cause
for
alarm
started
a
handsome
and
foreigner
began
taking
immediate
notice
of
her
he
was
so
quick
to
pick
her
out
in
the
throng
that
it
seemed
he
must
have
been
watching
for
her
whoever
and
whatever
he
was
he
was
manifestly
a
man
of
breeding
the
kind
of
man
who
might
have
been
her
companion
in
the
old
wild
days
of
her
triumphant
folly
he
was
about
tall
dark
and
of
military
bearing
he
had
a
mustache
bold
black
eyes
and
a
latin
type
of
countenance
that
was
all
that
hindwood
permitted
himself
to
observe
changing
his
position
promptly
he
shut
santa
out
from
the
line
of
vision
but
the
man
was
not
to
be
balked
with
an
air
of
complete
unconcern
he
fell
into
line
immediately
behind
them
treading
closely
on
their
heels
as
they
passed
up
the
gangplank
on
the
way
to
the
customs
he
managed
to
get
ahead
so
that
he
could
glance
back
several
times
at
santa
after
their
baggage
had
been
inspected
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
file
through
a
stuffy
room
where
passports
were
examined
it
was
here
that
hindwood
was
fully
prepared
to
be
caught
the
officials
at
dover
had
probably
cabled
a
warning
the
inquisitive
stranger
might
prove
to
be
their
emissary
quite
the
contrary
occurred
the
french
official
catching
sight
of
the
magic
words
and
scrutinized
no
further
and
returned
the
papers
with
a
courteous
apology
making
the
most
of
his
luck
hindwood
hurried
santa
out
onto
the
platform
down
the
long
train
labeled
stuttgart
warsaw
and
into
the
which
went
express
to
vienna
before
leaving
london
he
had
reserved
two
separate
compartments
in
the
name
of
hindwood
and
now
that
he
claimed
them
he
found
to
his
annoyance
that
they
were
adjoining
and
connected
by
a
private
door
it
was
an
indiscretion
that
he
had
not
intended
having
seen
santa
safely
settled
he
set
off
to
superintend
the
placing
on
board
of
their
bags
he
was
gone
perhaps
five
minutes
as
he
reentered
the
corridor
of
his
section
the
first
sight
that
met
his
eyes
was
the
handsome
stranger
engaged
in
earnest
talk
with
the
conductor
some
money
passed
next
thing
the
stranger
belongings
were
being
transferred
from
lower
down
the
train
to
the
compartment
on
the
further
side
from
santa
hindwood
entered
his
own
compartment
shaded
the
windows
that
looked
out
on
the
corridor
and
made
fast
his
door
what
was
the
game
was
this
a
fresh
example
of
santa
irresistible
charm
and
if
it
was
was
he
to
be
subjected
to
this
kind
of
impertinence
throughout
the
entire
journey
or
was
the
man
a
secret
service
agent
in
the
employ
of
some
foreign
government
who
believing
he
had
recognized
her
was
keeping
her
in
sight
till
she
should
have
crossed
the
frontier
into
his
own
country
where
he
would
have
power
to
arrest
her
in
his
anger
he
tried
to
blame
santa
she
must
have
unconsciously
exercised
her
talent
for
attraction
strangers
did
follow
women
unless
but
he
had
to
own
himself
unjust
she
was
dressed
with
the
utmost
plainness
in
a
tailored
costume
minus
furs
or
any
lavishness
there
was
nothing
to
complain
of
in
her
deportment
it
was
as
modest
as
could
have
been
expected
had
she
really
been
jones
aged
thirty
citizen
confidential
the
fault
lay
in
something
beyond
her
control
her
beauty
it
refused
to
be
subdued
it
shone
out
the
more
conspicuously
in
the
absence
of
adornment
it
constituted
itself
an
unforeseen
embarrassment
if
not
a
menace
the
further
he
traveled
into
continental
countries
the
less
he
would
be
believed
when
he
stated
that
she
was
miss
jones
and
no
more
than
his
secretary
already
more
people
than
the
obtrusive
stranger
had
stared
at
her
she
had
only
to
appear
to
make
herself
the
focus
of
attention
sooner
or
later
a
month
hence
some
one
would
catch
sight
of
her
who
had
known
her
in
the
past
she
had
been
feted
in
too
many
cities
her
portrait
had
been
too
widely
published
for
her
features
not
to
be
remembered
these
distressing
reflections
were
cut
short
by
the
shrill
tootings
of
tin
horns
which
announce
the
departure
of
a
train
in
france
when
calais
had
been
left
behind
and
they
were
rushing
past
stripped
orchards
and
harvested
fields
he
unlatched
the
dividing
door
she
was
sitting
lost
in
thought
staring
out
of
the
window
with
a
wistful
expression
into
my
compartment
i
like
to
the
jerk
with
which
she
turned
betrayed
the
strain
under
which
she
was
laboring
he
watched
the
undulating
grace
with
which
she
rose
the
calculated
delicacy
of
her
every
movement
though
she
had
dressed
in
rags
nothing
could
have
disguised
her
when
he
had
closed
the
door
she
remained
standing
sit
down
he
said
with
cold
politeness
safe
for
the
moment
as
you
see
i
lowered
the
blinds
no
one
can
spy
on
us
you
noticed
him
drawing
off
her
gloves
she
smoothed
them
out
mechanically
maintaining
her
silence
me
he
urged
do
you
make
of
him
her
voice
was
flat
and
toneless
i
go
it
always
the
same
you
ought
to
know
on
the
you
were
like
he
passed
over
the
implied
accusation
you
do
think
a
not
troubled
to
she
glanced
drearily
aside
are
brutes
if
you
left
me
alone
on
the
cliff
i
wish
you
had
it
would
have
been
all
she
said
it
without
spite
almost
without
reproach
in
the
presence
of
her
melancholy
he
recovered
something
of
his
compassion
i
did
leave
you
and
nothing
gained
by
recrimination
the
point
is
this
fellow
next
door
what
his
purpose
how
are
we
going
to
manage
him
fling
me
to
him
as
you
toss
a
dog
a
bone
you
be
rid
of
your
share
of
the
do
want
to
be
rid
of
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
mastering
his
impatience
do
pretend
i
sha
be
glad
be
quit
of
me
she
prompted
be
relieved
of
the
risk
of
you
he
corrected
not
until
fulfilled
my
she
smiled
promised
you
save
me
i
ca
be
saved
talk
about
redeeming
me
was
visionary
i
was
born
to
be
what
i
he
relaxed
and
sat
forward
exerting
himself
to
make
the
conversation
less
unfriendly
course
i
know
why
you
speak
this
way
it
because
of
my
recent
treatment
of
you
we
were
nearly
found
out
at
dover
the
anxiety
of
it
getting
on
my
nerves
i
promised
to
give
you
your
chance
my
promise
stands
the
least
i
can
ask
of
you
as
a
sportswoman
is
to
play
up
to
her
whole
demeanor
changed
the
golden
face
flashed
if
this
man
is
only
an
impudent
admirer
how
are
we
to
shake
him
it
my
business
for
the
present
to
protect
you
if
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
always
happens
it
possible
that
it
occur
again
i
dare
resent
his
conduct
ordinarily
i
should
know
what
to
do
with
him
how
is
the
repetition
of
the
annoyance
to
be
avoided
a
slow
flush
mounted
from
her
throat
to
her
cheeks
wo
take
my
suggestion
so
i
do
think
i
make
have
not
looking
at
him
she
muttered
try
to
scrape
acquaintance
when
he
does
introduce
me
to
him
as
your
to
do
that
he
fell
silent
he
was
thinking
of
anna
for
the
first
time
he
was
conscious
of
his
aloneness
with
this
woman
not
wishing
to
wound
her
he
procrastinated
do
that
might
only
add
to
our
her
gray
eyes
struggled
to
meet
his
gaze
is
likely
he
wo
believe
what
would
be
gained
have
told
him
without
insult
that
he
was
he
glanced
out
of
the
window
at
the
rushing
landscape
at
last
he
spoke
there
no
other
way
she
rested
her
thin
fine
hand
on
his
gently
generous
if
the
day
ever
comes
when
you
despise
yourself
as
i
despise
myself
remember
that
once
you
were
able
to
make
a
wicked
woman
believe
in
goodness
to
make
her
long
with
all
her
heart
to
be
like
her
eyes
became
misty
this
moment
i
not
far
from
lunch
was
announced
he
gave
orders
to
have
it
served
in
his
compartment
while
they
ate
he
outlined
to
her
his
plans
he
had
asked
her
how
long
she
expected
to
be
with
him
her
reply
was
discomfortingly
vague
long
as
you
can
endure
of
two
months
he
told
her
think
i
can
promise
you
immunity
at
present
according
to
information
central
starving
with
winter
comes
the
crisis
i
forseen
that
for
some
time
i
been
shipping
food
to
holland
it
lying
there
in
warehouses
in
immense
quantities
i
have
an
entire
fleet
secretly
at
work
plying
back
and
forth
across
the
atlantic
when
the
famine
becomes
too
acute
prepared
to
strike
my
bargain
i
take
railroads
and
concessions
in
exchange
for
bread
other
upstarts
have
carved
out
kingdoms
with
armies
i
intend
to
conquer
mine
with
food
there
never
was
a
war
or
any
social
uprising
that
was
caused
by
an
empty
stomach
within
three
hours
of
my
terms
having
been
accepted
my
trains
will
be
streaming
out
of
holland
where
they
halt
the
flames
of
revolution
will
be
quenched
if
i
have
miscalculated
i
shall
be
unofficial
president
of
the
united
states
of
he
paused
to
watch
his
effect
nominated
myself
he
smiled
his
smile
was
unreturned
she
was
regarding
him
with
an
expression
of
horror
their
rôles
seemed
reversed
it
was
evident
that
to
her
way
of
thinking
it
was
he
who
had
become
the
criminal
and
she
who
was
looking
down
on
him
from
a
higher
moral
level
they
her
voice
shook
passionately
you
have
these
stores
why
do
you
feed
them
they
dying
so
many
of
them
are
children
do
he
tried
to
make
his
tones
reasonable
invested
all
my
fortune
in
the
venture
i
a
business
man
in
business
one
man
calamity
is
another
opportunity
the
same
is
true
of
seeing
that
she
still
looked
grieved
he
patted
her
shoulder
worry
we
rustle
through
your
life
will
be
was
thinking
of
my
she
spoke
contemptuously
of
what
the
women
dead
of
hunger
in
the
ditches
about
as
she
rose
to
leave
she
glanced
back
from
the
doorway
was
a
message
i
had
to
deliver
to
you
varensky
setting
out
on
his
last
journey
he
hopes
to
see
you
in
budapest
he
told
me
to
say
you
can
have
her
ii
thrusting
its
head
into
the
clouds
amiens
had
been
left
behind
they
were
skirting
the
old
though
seasons
had
come
and
vanished
memories
of
tragedy
were
still
apparent
walls
had
been
patched
but
the
patches
served
to
emphasize
the
ruin
one
could
trace
in
the
landscape
crumbling
and
the
rusty
red
of
entangled
wire
here
and
there
in
gleaming
plots
white
crosses
grew
in
humble
clusters
in
fancy
he
pictured
the
hosts
who
had
died
the
unprofitable
patience
of
their
sacrifice
had
they
known
what
was
to
be
the
result
would
they
have
gone
to
their
death
so
gladly
the
result
of
their
idealism
was
hunger
he
recalled
his
awkward
phrase
the
hunger
had
proved
to
be
his
opportunity
santa
horror
disturbed
his
memory
he
was
inclined
to
go
to
her
and
explain
everything
had
to
be
purchased
by
labor
anything
one
possessed
was
the
wage
of
labor
to
give
things
away
did
harm
it
was
business
it
set
a
premium
on
laziness
even
to
give
food
to
a
starving
nation
did
harm
it
made
that
nation
a
pauper
the
most
primitive
of
all
laws
was
that
bread
should
be
earned
by
the
sweat
of
the
brow
that
if
a
man
did
not
toil
neither
should
he
eat
the
only
righteous
way
to
feed
starving
people
was
to
set
them
to
work
so
his
thoughts
ran
on
building
up
the
argument
but
he
did
not
go
to
her
it
was
varensky
message
that
deterred
him
told
me
to
say
you
can
have
her
did
santa
know
what
was
meant
that
the
message
referred
to
anna
she
must
know
what
difference
would
this
make
to
her
she
also
loved
and
she
was
a
the
countryside
grew
blurred
with
dusk
the
stiff
white
crosses
faded
out
of
sight
forgetting
his
danger
he
fell
asleep
wondering
whether
anna
would
be
with
her
husband
at
budapest
iii
when
he
awoke
he
was
in
total
darkness
glancing
through
the
window
he
discovered
that
the
world
outside
was
weakly
lit
with
straggling
rows
of
they
seemed
to
be
marching
in
the
same
direction
as
the
train
in
the
far
distance
they
rushed
together
making
night
hollow
with
their
flare
his
first
thought
was
of
santa
a
thousand
things
might
have
happened
as
he
groped
at
the
handle
of
the
dividing
door
he
caught
the
sound
of
laughter
i
enter
the
santa
whom
his
eyes
encountered
was
no
longer
the
fugitive
from
justice
she
was
mysteriously
changed
there
was
animation
in
her
countenance
and
seduction
in
her
voice
she
was
again
the
enchantress
of
men
reckless
and
tender
who
had
all
but
captured
his
heart
on
the
atlantic
voyage
he
looked
to
see
what
had
caused
this
transformation
lolling
in
the
entrance
was
the
handsome
stranger
before
hindwood
could
speak
she
was
addressing
him
gaily
wakened
i
did
like
to
disturb
you
you
almost
made
me
miss
my
dinner
if
you
ready
now
the
stranger
interrupted
not
dined
but
i
have
my
place
reserved
if
there
should
prove
to
be
no
room
perhaps
you
would
flatter
me
by
occupying
my
place
santa
shook
her
head
graciously
good
of
you
but
my
husband
and
i
will
take
our
she
was
the
only
one
whom
her
claim
that
was
her
husband
left
undisturbed
the
two
men
glared
at
each
other
in
astonishment
it
was
the
stranger
who
recovered
first
i
had
known
that
this
lady
was
your
wife
i
should
have
asked
your
permission
before
i
made
my
offer
i
shall
be
very
happy
if
you
will
permit
me
to
do
you
both
this
service
i
ought
to
introduce
he
fumbled
in
his
pocketbook
and
produced
a
card
on
which
was
engraved
serge
lajos
hungarian
royal
name
is
hindwood
philip
hindwood
returned
the
compliment
surlily
agree
with
my
wife
we
both
prefer
that
you
retain
your
place
and
that
we
be
allowed
to
take
our
santa
rose
eagerly
to
prevent
the
giving
of
further
offense
her
smile
was
for
the
captain
waste
time
talking
you
join
us
captain
we
take
our
chance
without
risking
a
reply
she
led
the
way
hindwood
following
and
the
captain
coming
last
there
was
no
opportunity
for
speech
in
the
swaying
corridor
when
the
was
reached
they
were
shown
immediately
to
a
vacant
table
at
first
they
sat
in
silence
watching
how
the
lights
flashing
by
the
panes
were
strengthening
into
a
golden
blur
are
we
it
was
hindwood
who
had
decided
to
be
amiable
late
as
that
he
consulted
his
watch
go
through
without
changing
they
told
no
change
till
the
captain
answers
were
mechanical
he
seemed
to
be
brushing
aside
a
presence
that
annoyed
him
his
puzzled
eyes
were
fixed
on
santa
suppressing
his
irritation
hindwood
made
another
effort
at
friendliness
did
notice
you
till
we
were
getting
into
calais
i
guess
we
must
have
traveled
together
from
captain
lajos
if
that
really
was
his
name
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
something
else
he
let
some
seconds
elapse
when
he
spoke
it
was
without
looking
up
noticed
you
from
the
first
i
can
prove
it
your
wife
did
join
you
till
then
he
seemed
to
repent
of
his
intrusive
rudeness
and
changed
the
subject
was
glad
to
see
the
last
of
london
i
been
sent
to
meet
some
one
who
failed
to
arrive
it
was
all
in
the
papers
you
probably
know
as
much
about
the
circumstances
as
i
do
the
person
was
prince
santa
face
went
white
her
lips
became
set
in
an
artificial
smile
beneath
the
table
her
hand
clutched
hindwood
for
all
that
it
was
she
who
took
up
the
challenge
not
been
reading
the
papers
above
the
clatter
of
the
wheels
her
trembling
voice
was
scarcely
audible
husband
and
i
have
been
very
busy
and
but
your
friend
why
was
he
so
unkind
as
to
disappoint
you
the
captain
had
turned
to
her
as
though
greedy
for
her
sympathy
his
dark
bold
eyes
drank
up
her
face
was
unkind
he
was
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
spread
abroad
his
hands
something
is
proved
i
suppose
the
best
way
to
express
it
would
be
to
say
that
he
was
unavoidably
delayed
he
left
new
york
on
a
liner
and
disappeared
on
the
evening
that
he
should
have
hindwood
bent
forward
attempting
to
divert
attention
from
santa
he
tapped
the
captain
hand
me
for
intruding
on
a
conversation
which
you
evidently
intend
to
include
only
my
wife
but
there
are
no
points
of
call
on
an
atlantic
voyage
if
your
friend
started
from
new
york
and
the
ship
was
not
lost
how
could
he
have
been
delayed
that
the
the
captain
hostility
was
unmistakable
and
yet
the
odd
thing
was
that
it
exempted
santa
while
the
first
course
was
being
served
hindwood
racked
his
brains
to
discover
the
motive
which
lay
behind
the
captain
attitude
was
he
a
amusing
himself
and
biding
his
time
was
he
doubtful
of
santa
identity
and
cultivating
her
acquaintance
as
a
means
of
making
certain
was
he
merely
a
disappointed
male
infuriated
at
finding
a
husband
in
possession
santa
was
speaking
again
she
had
made
good
use
of
the
respite
to
compose
herself
must
have
been
terribly
anxious
for
you
waiting
i
suppose
you
were
there
to
meet
him
at
the
port
where
he
ought
to
have
arrived
hindwood
held
his
breath
she
was
practically
asking
the
man
whether
he
had
been
one
of
the
welcoming
group
of
officials
on
that
night
when
the
had
reached
plymouth
if
he
had
been
he
must
have
seen
them
he
must
remember
them
he
might
even
know
their
biographical
details
their
business
and
that
they
were
not
married
at
all
events
if
that
were
the
case
it
would
explain
the
keenness
of
his
interest
i
was
at
they
both
shot
upright
in
their
chairs
and
sat
rigid
for
a
moment
they
had
no
doubt
that
the
captain
had
declared
his
hand
then
he
postponed
the
crisis
by
adding
see
my
friend
as
you
call
him
was
traveling
by
the
line
so
plymouth
was
where
he
should
have
landed
we
had
a
special
train
arranged
to
hurry
him
to
london
the
first
warning
i
received
of
the
disaster
was
at
paddington
when
i
was
informed
that
the
special
train
had
been
it
was
a
disaster
santa
asked
the
question
in
an
awed
tone
which
under
the
circumstances
was
not
altogether
feigned
getting
a
grip
on
herself
she
leaned
across
the
table
making
her
eyes
large
and
tender
my
husband
and
i
are
americans
when
we
part
from
you
it
almost
certain
we
shall
never
meet
again
i
not
seeking
your
confidence
but
you
worried
if
it
would
help
you
to
tell
the
captain
shook
his
head
gravely
he
appeared
to
be
worshiping
her
in
everything
save
words
though
it
was
possible
that
his
adoration
was
mockery
nothing
to
tell
not
yet
i
wish
there
were
there
may
be
something
at
paris
the
english
police
are
working
they
promised
to
keep
in
touch
with
me
by
with
amazing
daring
santa
persisted
what
do
you
suppose
happened
before
answering
the
captain
arranged
his
knife
and
fork
neatly
on
his
plate
he
looked
up
sharply
like
a
bird
of
prey
to
your
dainty
ears
that
must
sound
shocking
i
have
reasons
for
this
belief
which
for
the
present
i
not
at
liberty
to
during
the
pause
that
followed
hindwood
was
on
tenterhooks
lest
with
her
next
question
she
should
betray
herself
to
prevent
her
he
flung
himself
into
the
gap
agree
with
you
he
said
with
weighty
dullness
agree
with
you
that
some
sort
of
accident
strikes
one
as
extremely
likely
you
mentioned
that
a
special
had
been
chartered
to
bring
your
friend
to
london
that
would
indicate
that
he
was
a
person
of
the
words
sounded
like
an
epitaph
they
were
spoken
with
the
impatience
of
a
door
being
banged
turning
to
santa
the
captain
was
on
the
point
of
saying
something
further
when
the
waiter
approached
with
the
information
that
at
the
next
stop
the
would
be
cut
off
they
became
aware
that
they
were
the
only
diners
left
the
train
was
slowing
down
the
noise
of
its
progress
had
changed
to
a
hollow
rumbling
which
told
them
that
a
bridge
was
being
crossed
shifting
their
gaze
they
discovered
paris
sparkling
like
a
pile
of
jewels
strewn
in
the
lap
of
night
below
them
in
slow
coils
mysterious
with
luminous
reflections
wound
the
seine
instant
thought
was
that
somewhere
out
there
beneath
the
darkness
the
woods
of
vincennes
were
hiding
having
paid
their
bill
they
commenced
the
return
journey
through
corridors
dense
with
eager
passengers
before
their
section
had
been
reached
the
train
was
in
the
station
at
the
first
open
door
the
captain
sprang
to
the
platform
and
was
lost
he
gone
santa
whispered
hindwood
glanced
at
her
palely
get
his
telegram
to
get
seizing
her
arm
he
hurried
her
back
to
his
compartment
where
behind
locked
doors
they
could
spend
in
private
whatever
of
freedom
remained
iv
the
jig
hoping
that
he
was
creating
an
impression
of
calmness
he
lit
a
cigarette
she
raised
her
face
to
his
with
a
softness
in
her
eyes
that
he
had
never
noticed
it
is
she
pleaded
clutching
at
his
hands
you
had
the
least
idea
who
i
really
am
disown
me
act
as
though
my
arrest
had
come
to
you
as
an
utter
he
seated
himself
beside
her
my
dear
santa
that
would
help
me
of
course
not
she
agreed
with
rapid
vehemence
caught
i
beyond
helping
it
of
you
i
thinking
you
with
your
generosity
and
your
splendid
plans
if
i
dragged
you
down
as
i
dragged
down
all
the
others
my
heart
would
break
i
never
meant
you
any
harm
you
do
believe
me
do
you
know
that
i
loved
you
she
urged
and
when
he
hesitated
time
running
short
let
me
hear
you
say
just
once
i
know
that
you
loved
me
i
know
would
kiss
me
she
asked
the
question
scarcely
above
her
breath
been
so
many
who
paid
to
kiss
me
you
would
give
me
the
best
that
would
be
the
last
when
his
lips
touched
hers
she
smiled
may
come
minutes
dragged
by
like
hours
every
sound
was
magnified
into
something
monstrous
a
dozen
times
they
imagined
they
heard
police
clearing
the
corridor
preparatory
to
bursting
in
the
door
what
they
heard
was
only
passengers
and
porters
disposing
of
their
baggage
at
last
suspense
became
its
own
anesthetic
he
tell
you
his
destination
hindwood
whispered
not
daring
to
speak
she
shook
her
head
did
you
get
into
conversation
with
him
her
lips
scarcely
moved
he
had
to
listen
acutely
did
he
pretended
to
have
mistaken
his
compartment
i
was
crying
he
were
you
crying
of
you
told
him
did
he
say
i
heard
you
laughing
when
i
entered
how
did
he
commence
said
i
was
too
beautiful
to
be
unhappy
it
the
way
every
man
starts
then
he
said
that
he
recognized
me
just
as
though
he
been
looking
for
me
always
and
then
he
tortured
me
by
wondering
whether
our
paths
had
ever
you
answered
unless
he
seen
me
in
hindwood
fell
silent
without
warning
he
leaped
to
his
feet
before
he
could
escape
she
was
clinging
to
him
leave
me
to
face
he
freed
himself
from
her
grasp
i
guessed
right
you
wo
have
to
face
with
that
he
was
gone
a
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
he
had
not
returned
nothing
that
she
dreaded
had
happened
with
a
lurch
the
train
jerked
forward
farewells
were
being
shouted
streamed
past
the
scarcer
lights
of
then
at
last
the
warmth
of
a
city
under
darkness
the
door
opened
she
rose
trembling
steadying
herself
against
the
wall
when
she
saw
who
it
was
she
sank
back
were
on
the
wrong
he
spoke
leisurely
lajos
lying
i
followed
him
he
met
his
man
with
the
telegram
he
suspects
us
so
little
that
he
showed
it
to
me
it
read
further
developments
she
pressed
her
handkerchief
to
her
lips
and
then
should
he
have
shown
it
to
you
it
was
to
put
us
off
our
he
sat
down
in
the
seat
opposite
think
not
he
changed
his
tactics
he
made
up
his
mind
to
be
friendly
it
you
he
after
but
in
a
different
fashion
he
thinks
he
in
love
with
he
threatened
it
was
our
own
guilty
conscience
here
how
i
figure
it
out
he
probably
has
seen
you
before
he
ca
remember
where
it
may
have
been
in
the
days
when
you
were
dancing
it
was
the
vague
recollection
of
you
that
piqued
his
curiosity
and
got
him
staring
when
he
found
you
alone
and
crying
he
thought
he
stumbled
on
an
adventure
my
entering
upset
his
calculations
i
became
for
him
the
cruel
husband
he
hated
me
on
the
spot
my
dear
santa
our
meeting
with
him
is
the
luckiest
thing
that
could
have
dabbing
her
eyes
she
tried
to
laugh
do
see
as
plain
as
a
he
bent
forward
lowering
his
voice
was
mixed
up
with
prince
rogovich
he
one
of
the
people
hunting
for
you
in
his
company
you
wo
be
suspected
he
get
you
across
all
the
she
was
still
reluctantly
incredulous
the
things
he
said
at
dinner
he
played
with
us
like
a
was
playing
with
hindwood
became
eager
in
his
determination
to
convince
her
was
playing
into
our
hands
he
knows
all
the
things
that
we
want
to
know
every
move
the
police
make
is
telegraphed
to
him
it
was
the
frankness
with
which
he
let
us
into
his
secrets
that
was
so
how
must
we
act
way
we
have
been
acting
until
it
safe
to
be
rid
of
him
we
must
keep
him
believing
that
we
married
and
none
too
happily
i
afraid
it
up
to
you
to
keep
him
lulled
by
pretending
she
closed
her
eyes
like
going
back
to
the
ugly
beastly
i
he
spoke
seriously
what
else
any
moment
he
may
recall
where
last
he
saw
you
sleep
over
it
we
can
decide
in
the
v
all
night
he
had
been
haunted
by
the
oppressive
sense
that
if
he
did
not
watch
something
terrible
would
happen
it
was
shortly
after
dawn
when
he
rose
stepping
into
the
corridor
he
found
that
he
had
the
train
to
himself
it
seemed
as
depopulated
as
an
early
morning
house
and
despite
the
clamor
of
its
going
as
silent
he
placed
himself
near
santa
door
and
stood
staring
out
at
the
misty
landscape
streaking
past
like
a
trail
of
smoke
it
was
here
that
santa
found
him
when
she
slipped
from
her
compartment
he
turned
quickly
not
up
then
noticing
her
pallor
and
the
shadows
under
her
eyes
have
slept
your
decision
i
suppose
she
bit
her
lip
nervously
shall
have
to
pretend
it
only
be
pretending
you
understand
wo
last
long
he
comforted
her
we
been
running
on
time
we
must
be
in
already
within
the
next
few
hours
be
out
of
france
and
into
germany
you
feel
safer
there
wo
you
what
he
was
really
asking
was
whether
it
was
true
that
during
the
war
she
been
a
german
spy
i
was
all
she
answered
they
fell
silent
without
mentioning
it
each
guessed
the
motive
which
had
occasioned
the
other
early
rising
they
dared
not
let
the
captain
out
of
their
sight
while
they
could
not
see
him
they
had
no
peace
of
mind
whereas
yesterday
his
companionship
had
seemed
to
spell
death
it
spelt
protection
yesterday
they
had
done
everything
to
elude
him
it
would
probably
be
he
who
would
do
the
avoiding
it
was
essential
that
they
should
have
won
his
confidence
before
they
arrived
on
german
soil
there
was
little
time
to
lose
he
had
not
appeared
when
the
first
sitting
for
breakfast
was
announced
in
the
restaurant
car
they
dawdled
over
their
meal
and
sat
on
long
after
it
was
ended
they
had
even
begun
to
discuss
the
possibility
of
his
having
left
the
train
during
the
night
when
with
an
eagerness
kindred
to
their
own
he
entered
hindwood
waved
to
him
afraid
we
finished
but
wo
you
seat
yourself
at
our
table
i
no
doubt
my
wife
will
join
you
in
a
cup
of
coffee
while
you
breakfast
if
it
not
objectionable
i
smoke
a
captain
lajos
beamed
like
a
pleased
boy
if
one
was
prejudiced
in
his
disfavor
it
was
possible
to
find
him
likable
shall
be
delighted
he
said
in
an
embarrassed
tone
are
tedious
nowadays
once
every
one
who
counted
was
gay
and
prosperous
one
was
never
at
a
loss
to
find
a
friend
in
this
bankrupt
world
the
only
travelers
are
and
he
laughed
may
as
well
confess
i
did
think
you
were
up
yet
that
what
made
me
late
i
was
so
tired
of
my
own
society
that
i
was
waiting
for
as
he
said
was
waiting
for
you
his
eyes
flashed
on
santa
it
was
she
who
spoke
fancy
we
been
just
as
bored
with
ourselves
and
even
more
eager
to
meet
you
what
you
told
us
last
night
sounded
so
mysterious
and
romantic
i
could
hardly
sleep
for
thinking
about
it
to
have
a
prince
for
one
friend
and
to
travel
so
far
to
welcome
him
only
to
find
she
clasped
her
hands
childishly
can
be
so
drab
how
drab
a
man
of
your
kind
can
never
know
american
husbands
no
matter
what
they
possess
take
a
pride
in
always
he
disappointed
her
curiosity
with
a
crooked
smile
you
a
prince
or
a
millionaire
there
nothing
romantic
about
being
then
her
allurement
kindled
the
longing
in
his
eyes
wanting
me
to
confide
the
secrets
that
i
warned
you
i
could
share
surely
you
must
know
something
of
prince
rogovich
she
returned
his
searching
gaze
with
apparent
frankness
hindwood
jogged
her
elbow
dear
i
remembered
when
we
sailed
there
was
a
prince
rogovich
in
the
states
doing
his
best
to
raise
a
loan
i
think
it
was
for
poland
it
was
rumored
that
the
money
was
to
be
squandered
on
military
adventures
i
guess
he
did
find
many
takers
you
in
the
hungarian
hussars
captain
but
you
must
excuse
me
for
stating
that
on
our
side
of
the
atlantic
we
seen
all
we
want
of
santa
clicked
her
tongue
impatiently
all
very
well
but
it
does
explain
why
the
prince
might
hindwood
insisted
mildly
men
often
commit
suicide
he
was
coming
home
he
failed
in
his
object
the
captain
glanced
quickly
behind
him
to
see
whether
any
one
could
have
heard
him
he
continued
in
a
voice
that
was
little
above
a
whisper
a
few
of
us
knew
he
was
coming
home
in
leaning
across
the
table
with
suppressed
excitement
santa
made
the
appeal
of
pretty
women
throughout
the
ages
wish
you
trust
hindwood
pushed
back
his
chair
time
for
a
cigar
perhaps
join
me
later
if
you
excuse
me
they
paid
him
scant
attention
the
last
he
saw
of
them
they
were
gazing
enraptured
into
each
other
eyes
vi
it
was
well
over
an
hour
since
he
had
returned
to
his
compartment
he
had
left
his
door
wide
so
that
he
could
inspect
every
one
who
passed
along
the
corridor
they
could
have
slipped
by
without
his
noticing
he
was
becoming
almost
as
distrustful
of
santa
as
he
was
of
the
stranger
already
the
rôle
of
unwanted
husband
was
growing
irksome
the
thing
that
baffled
him
most
was
her
morbid
curiosity
it
was
revolting
to
think
of
her
with
her
disarming
air
of
refinement
encouraging
her
admirer
to
conjecture
the
details
of
a
crime
which
she
herself
had
committed
but
how
had
she
committed
it
he
himself
did
not
know
he
had
just
begun
to
contrive
the
scene
in
his
mind
when
they
entered
her
face
was
lit
with
a
new
intensity
at
a
glance
he
was
aware
that
whatever
she
had
learned
had
quickened
her
emotions
the
captain
followed
grudgingly
like
a
dog
hanging
back
on
a
chain
lajos
has
been
telling
me
she
commenced
we
better
have
the
door
closed
he
been
telling
me
things
that
you
ought
to
know
he
so
concerned
for
my
sake
that
he
offered
to
repeat
the
captain
seated
himself
opposite
to
and
regarded
him
gravely
things
that
i
been
telling
your
wife
are
not
my
secrets
i
must
ask
you
to
give
me
your
solemn
may
take
that
for
there
one
other
point
i
did
offer
to
repeat
them
it
was
hindwood
who
urged
me
i
making
this
plain
because
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
offering
you
my
advice
hindwood
lit
a
fresh
cigar
fortifying
himself
against
whatever
shock
was
pending
give
you
full
credit
for
your
let
me
ask
you
a
question
have
you
noticed
that
there
are
scarcely
any
women
on
this
train
believe
you
right
but
until
you
mentioned
it
i
had
if
you
watch
you
see
that
i
correct
there
are
women
and
children
in
plenty
on
trains
moving
westward
but
on
trains
moving
eastward
where
we
going
hindwood
watched
the
man
intently
wondering
at
what
he
was
driving
you
be
surprised
he
continued
i
were
to
tell
you
that
one
of
the
chief
reasons
for
the
women
absence
is
this
affair
of
prince
rather
harp
on
prince
rogovich
do
you
hindwood
flicked
his
ash
a
time
one
ceases
to
be
surprised
at
anything
but
you
presuming
too
much
in
insisting
on
his
having
been
murdered
all
that
known
by
your
own
account
is
that
he
vanished
in
any
case
what
can
he
possibly
have
to
do
with
the
scarcity
of
women
on
trains
running
eastward
the
captain
face
darkened
with
earnestness
trying
to
tell
you
is
that
you
taking
your
wife
into
danger
every
man
who
can
afford
it
in
the
countries
to
which
you
going
is
hurrying
his
to
france
england
spain
america
anywhere
westward
for
safety
they
can
feel
the
storm
rising
the
deluge
of
catastrophe
that
ca
be
held
back
much
longer
when
it
bursts
tear
everything
established
from
its
moorings
and
sweep
across
europe
in
a
wave
of
this
deluge
that
you
speak
of
what
had
prince
rogovich
to
do
with
it
was
keeping
it
from
hindwood
smiled
man
single
strength
could
accomplish
that
he
was
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
the
resisting
forces
when
society
tottering
it
the
little
added
strain
that
upsets
the
equilibrium
remember
how
the
last
war
started
with
an
obscure
hindwood
crossed
his
knees
and
dug
himself
back
into
the
cushions
information
to
say
the
least
of
it
is
strangely
melodramatic
if
i
understand
you
aright
you
urging
me
to
discontinue
my
journey
you
be
more
explicit
the
captain
betrayed
a
hint
of
temper
suppose
i
shall
have
to
if
i
to
convince
you
the
stability
of
the
whole
of
central
and
eastern
europe
has
been
upset
by
the
repartitioning
of
the
peace
treaty
the
situation
as
it
exists
is
intolerable
the
ruin
which
the
war
commenced
has
been
completed
by
the
pacification
the
old
social
order
has
been
overthrown
in
its
place
we
have
a
dozen
rash
experiments
in
russia
instead
of
the
czar
we
have
bolshevism
in
what
was
once
the
empire
we
have
a
series
of
republics
which
are
nothing
more
than
old
racial
hatreds
entrenched
behind
newly
created
frontiers
in
poland
which
was
prisoner
to
three
nations
for
two
centuries
we
have
a
released
convict
vengeful
with
a
sense
of
past
injustice
instead
of
reconstruction
we
have
disorganization
trade
is
at
a
standstill
money
is
valueless
confidence
is
gone
poverty
has
made
a
clean
sweep
of
class
distinctions
has
usurped
the
rights
of
authority
like
a
lean
wolf
famine
gallops
through
the
desolation
in
ever
widening
prince
rogovich
hindwood
recalled
him
had
he
to
do
with
it
was
the
leader
of
the
monarchist
party
in
europe
the
organizer
of
a
secret
movement
to
set
up
again
the
thrones
which
war
has
toppled
incidentally
he
was
to
have
established
a
new
throne
for
himself
in
poland
behind
him
he
had
the
landowning
classes
and
the
old
aristocracy
which
the
new
regime
of
haphazard
democracy
has
beggared
he
was
biding
his
time
till
the
crisis
should
become
sufficiently
acute
for
him
to
strike
his
blow
he
had
his
armies
ready
all
he
lacked
was
munitions
the
floating
of
the
loan
in
america
completed
his
you
said
that
the
fact
that
he
was
returning
in
triumph
was
known
only
to
a
few
if
only
a
few
knew
it
why
should
his
death
have
caused
this
sudden
exodus
of
women
on
trains
running
westward
two
reasons
because
he
was
the
recognized
strong
man
of
the
buffer
states
which
lie
between
russian
anarchy
and
civilization
and
because
the
crisis
of
starvation
for
which
he
had
been
waiting
is
now
in
sight
while
bolshevism
was
making
its
drives
against
poland
central
europe
was
compelled
to
hold
together
now
that
bolshevism
is
crumbling
that
compulsion
is
relaxed
all
the
way
from
siberia
to
the
frontiers
of
germany
millions
are
perishing
from
lack
of
food
presently
the
russian
millions
will
commence
to
march
westward
to
the
lands
of
plenty
they
march
like
death
swinging
his
scythe
they
sweep
on
like
a
pestilence
they
lope
like
gaunt
wolves
savage
and
relentless
the
starving
peoples
of
central
europe
who
would
once
have
resisted
them
will
join
them
prince
rogovich
had
he
lived
could
have
prevented
it
was
santa
would
have
declared
a
new
war
with
the
return
to
monarchy
as
his
he
had
his
nucleus
armies
in
readiness
they
would
have
sprung
from
their
overnight
there
would
have
been
a
tremendous
rally
to
him
as
the
only
man
unscrupulous
enough
to
handle
the
situation
he
would
have
made
his
bargain
with
the
then
would
have
trained
his
guns
on
the
lean
hordes
of
russia
and
would
have
blown
them
back
across
their
again
santa
spoke
her
voice
came
low
and
haltingly
would
have
made
the
world
pass
through
the
fires
of
moloch
for
a
second
time
the
person
who
murdered
him
must
have
known
hindwood
turned
to
her
there
was
a
startled
expression
in
his
eyes
he
was
quite
certain
she
had
known
it
he
was
seeing
the
real
santa
for
the
first
time
she
was
a
charlotte
corday
who
had
dipped
her
hands
in
blood
that
she
might
prevent
a
more
colossal
crime
begin
to
see
he
muttered
the
captain
took
the
words
as
addressed
to
himself
glad
you
do
it
must
be
obvious
to
you
now
that
where
you
going
is
no
place
for
a
woman
if
you
accept
my
advice
you
turn
back
at
the
next
hindwood
recalled
himself
to
the
part
he
was
playing
a
soldier
you
be
ashamed
to
run
away
at
the
first
hint
of
danger
in
a
sense
i
also
am
a
soldier
a
soldier
of
business
i
too
have
my
marching
orders
and
my
if
you
wo
turn
back
yourself
send
hindwood
the
man
voice
shook
taking
her
to
almost
certain
death
she
too
beautiful
i
beg
it
of
to
his
amazement
hindwood
found
himself
liking
the
stranger
beauty
has
no
bearing
on
the
problem
we
exceedingly
grateful
to
you
captain
lajos
but
to
act
on
your
warning
it
out
of
the
the
captain
shot
him
a
dark
look
then
let
his
gaze
rest
on
santa
when
she
kept
her
eyes
averted
he
pretended
to
lose
interest
in
the
subject
the
train
was
slowing
down
he
cleared
the
pane
with
his
glove
the
hindwood
rose
and
hurriedly
commenced
to
gather
together
his
belongings
sitting
perfectly
still
with
an
air
of
quiet
criticism
the
captain
watched
him
when
the
last
bag
had
been
strapped
and
made
ready
for
removal
are
you
doing
that
he
inquired
german
customs
i
suppose
we
have
to
get
out
and
go
through
the
old
of
being
do
need
to
you
can
have
it
done
here
excuse
me
if
i
seem
officious
i
was
immediately
behind
you
at
calais
and
could
help
noticing
that
your
passports
are
the
same
as
mine
diplomatic
the
advantage
of
a
diplomatic
passport
in
crossing
frontiers
is
that
the
officials
have
to
come
to
did
know
if
that
the
case
he
resumed
his
seat
with
a
sickening
sensation
the
captain
presence
was
stifling
him
he
longed
to
escape
if
it
were
only
for
five
minutes
he
felt
choked
with
lies
it
seemed
impossible
that
the
captain
should
not
be
aware
of
the
atmosphere
of
falsehood
passengers
were
already
filing
down
the
corridor
and
being
herded
by
soldiers
on
the
platform
as
carriages
were
emptied
doors
were
locked
and
sealed
evidently
nothing
was
to
be
left
to
chance
while
the
passengers
were
held
prisoners
in
the
the
train
was
to
be
searched
from
end
to
end
to
a
guilty
conscience
there
was
something
exceedingly
intimidating
about
this
military
display
of
thoroughness
the
conductor
looked
into
the
compartment
seeing
the
three
of
them
seated
there
he
burst
into
a
frantic
protest
captain
lajos
annihilated
him
with
the
ferocity
of
his
explanation
when
the
conductor
had
retreated
the
captain
turned
to
hindwood
most
of
your
compatriots
i
see
you
not
strong
on
languages
if
i
can
be
of
use
to
you
i
act
as
your
wife
is
then
he
remembered
that
he
knew
nothing
of
linguistic
attainments
very
thoughtful
of
our
comfort
he
substituted
guttural
voices
sounded
two
presented
themselves
without
waste
of
words
they
rasped
out
a
peremptory
order
want
to
see
your
passports
the
captain
interpreted
while
the
passports
were
being
examined
there
was
silence
again
questions
were
asked
and
again
the
captain
interpreted
you
carrying
you
any
contraband
you
intend
to
stay
in
germany
there
was
a
pause
the
passports
were
folded
and
on
the
point
of
being
returned
when
another
unintelligible
conversation
started
the
captain
smiled
punctilious
as
a
matter
of
form
they
want
to
hear
you
assert
that
you
the
philip
hindwood
to
whom
this
passport
was
certainly
they
can
prove
that
by
comparing
my
face
with
the
attached
the
captain
turned
to
santa
with
the
utmost
suavity
that
the
edith
jones
hindwood
having
exploded
his
bomb
he
rose
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
hesitate
as
to
whether
he
should
expose
them
then
making
a
stiff
bow
he
murmured
directly
he
had
departed
hindwood
locked
the
door
behind
him
shall
ferret
out
no
more
of
our
from
then
on
they
traveled
in
a
state
of
siege
several
times
they
thought
they
heard
a
tapping
whether
it
was
the
captain
they
did
not
allow
themselves
to
discover
they
opened
to
no
one
whom
they
had
not
summoned
vii
soon
after
the
train
restarted
santa
rested
her
hand
on
his
arm
think
better
of
me
now
i
so
tired
i
should
cry
if
you
spoke
to
me
let
me
sleep
on
your
couch
i
afraid
to
be
he
covered
her
with
his
rug
and
did
his
best
to
make
her
comfortable
she
was
utterly
exhausted
in
a
few
minutes
her
eyes
closed
and
she
was
breathing
gently
several
hours
elapsed
she
was
still
sleeping
he
was
glad
not
to
have
to
talk
his
mind
was
filled
with
a
tremendous
picture
was
a
certain
rich
man
which
was
clothed
in
purple
and
fine
linen
and
fared
sumptuously
every
day
and
there
was
a
certain
beggar
named
lazarus
which
was
laid
at
his
gate
full
of
he
saw
the
world
that
he
was
leaving
callous
he
saw
the
world
to
which
he
was
going
out
of
which
he
had
planned
to
make
a
profit
a
world
picked
clean
by
the
crime
of
war
and
peopled
by
living
skeletons
when
its
pain
had
passed
beyond
endurance
the
outcast
world
would
attack
the
world
which
was
comfortable
it
would
come
crawling
like
a
beggar
to
a
rich
man
door
when
it
found
the
door
barred
it
would
go
mad
it
had
nothing
to
lose
by
violence
with
its
bare
hands
it
would
storm
the
dwelling
how
would
the
comfortable
world
defend
itself
the
captain
said
with
cannon
from
a
safe
distance
it
would
blow
the
empty
bellies
into
nothingness
but
bread
was
cheaper
than
high
explosives
why
not
fill
the
empty
bellies
instead
of
shattering
them
he
recalled
the
fields
round
amiens
starred
with
miniature
forests
of
stiff
protesting
crosses
why
had
those
crosses
been
planted
if
it
had
not
been
to
teach
the
living
world
to
share
a
barricade
of
bread
could
prevent
further
bloodshed
it
always
could
have
prevented
it
the
gray
tide
of
could
be
halted
by
a
barricade
of
bread
strange
that
no
one
had
ever
thought
of
it
there
had
never
been
a
war
that
a
barricade
of
bread
could
not
have
halted
back
and
forth
across
the
atlantic
his
were
plying
in
holland
his
warehouses
were
bulging
he
glanced
at
the
sleeping
face
of
santa
sweet
and
sad
as
an
avenging
angel
her
solution
of
injustice
was
simple
to
slay
the
before
he
could
do
his
wrong
it
was
her
own
suffering
that
had
taught
her
this
cruel
mercy
if
she
a
disinherited
at
birth
could
so
risk
her
soul
salvation
for
humanity
he
drew
himself
up
sharply
he
was
turning
visionary
at
this
rate
he
would
end
as
a
second
varensky
all
his
plans
for
capturing
power
would
be
thwarted
he
had
seen
nothing
as
yet
that
would
corroborate
the
captain
disastrous
prophecies
at
stuttgart
he
watched
the
captain
receive
another
telegram
if
the
man
had
lied
to
him
what
was
his
purpose
how
much
did
he
know
how
much
did
he
infer
had
his
discovery
that
they
were
not
married
been
an
accident
or
had
he
led
up
to
it
by
strategy
when
vienna
was
reached
it
would
be
necessary
to
throw
him
off
their
track
they
were
winding
through
blue
valleys
of
the
bavarian
tyrol
steeped
in
the
contentment
of
autumnal
sunshine
like
eagles
nests
built
high
above
he
caught
glimpses
of
perched
on
narrow
ledges
here
and
there
they
passed
villages
mere
clusters
of
houses
childish
and
as
memories
of
fairyland
he
began
to
smile
at
his
mood
of
pessimism
were
santa
to
waken
she
would
refute
the
captain
bogey
stories
he
bent
over
her
tempted
to
rouse
her
at
last
he
shook
her
shoulder
do
be
frightened
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
what
the
captain
said
was
true
she
gazed
up
at
him
bewildered
dreams
still
in
her
eyes
then
turned
her
face
drowsily
back
to
the
pillow
was
true
i
part
about
prince
rogovich
and
blowing
those
starving
wretches
back
with
she
settled
herself
wearily
so
terribly
tired
i
do
want
to
be
and
then
was
why
i
killed
him
so
that
he
viii
darkness
had
long
since
gathered
when
they
crossed
the
into
austria
perhaps
it
was
no
more
than
imagination
but
he
immediately
became
conscious
of
a
vague
depression
glancing
through
the
misty
panes
he
espied
no
signs
of
life
only
bare
fields
pollarded
trees
like
gallows
and
the
sullen
profiles
of
shrouded
houses
no
trains
flashed
by
going
in
the
opposite
direction
wayside
stations
were
shuttered
night
was
a
stagnant
tank
in
the
silence
the
sound
of
their
own
going
was
the
only
clamor
it
was
not
until
they
were
nearing
vienna
that
any
lights
broke
the
monotony
of
the
blackness
even
these
like
lanterns
of
lonely
were
faint
and
rare
shadowy
and
rotting
factories
looked
less
like
habitations
than
monstrous
sepulchers
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
this
pulseless
carcass
had
once
been
the
bacchante
among
modern
metropolises
that
even
at
this
moment
memories
of
its
rhythm
were
setting
the
feet
of
happier
streets
to
music
he
caught
the
vision
of
other
cities
after
nightfall
new
york
a
tall
white
virgin
sheathed
in
jewels
london
a
grimy
smith
striking
sparks
from
a
giant
anvil
paris
a
wanton
goddess
smiling
through
the
dusk
her
face
lit
up
by
constellations
how
impossible
it
would
be
to
approach
any
one
of
them
without
becoming
aware
of
its
presence
yet
a
man
might
easily
travel
through
vienna
without
suspecting
that
it
lay
cowering
behind
the
darkness
it
was
after
midnight
when
the
train
halted
in
the
empty
cathedral
of
the
bahnhof
directly
the
doors
were
opened
lean
men
poured
into
the
compartments
whining
for
the
privilege
of
handling
the
baggage
hindwood
delayed
until
he
had
allowed
the
captain
sufficient
time
to
make
his
exit
then
he
thought
it
safe
to
assist
santa
to
the
platform
once
again
despite
the
lateness
of
the
hour
it
was
necessary
to
go
through
tedious
formalities
the
question
asked
most
pressingly
as
at
the
german
frontier
was
whether
they
were
possessed
of
at
last
they
were
free
to
go
in
search
of
beds
as
they
stepped
into
the
they
got
their
first
glimpse
of
austria
destitution
huddled
against
the
walls
was
a
collection
of
human
derelicts
which
seemed
more
in
keeping
with
dante
than
the
city
which
had
set
the
world
waltzing
to
merry
they
were
of
all
conditions
and
ages
from
grandparents
to
toddling
children
from
artisans
to
aristocrats
in
the
scant
light
they
lifted
up
greenish
faces
which
snarled
while
their
extended
hands
demanded
charity
the
police
beat
them
back
like
huntsmen
separating
hounds
from
their
quarry
they
retreated
whimpering
into
the
shadows
from
the
line
of
vehicles
which
were
waiting
hindwood
selected
a
creaking
taxi
having
seen
santa
seat
herself
he
ordered
the
man
to
drive
to
the
hotel
bristol
awful
he
groaned
as
he
sank
back
against
the
musty
cushions
she
stifled
a
sob
was
nothing
it
worse
than
he
spoke
again
did
see
the
captain
i
think
we
rid
of
would
be
down
the
long
deserted
mariahilfer
strasse
they
bumped
and
rattled
it
was
ungarnished
and
forbidding
as
an
empty
house
the
few
people
whom
they
met
scuffled
out
of
sight
at
sound
of
intrusion
looking
less
like
human
beings
than
vermin
over
all
there
hung
a
sense
of
evil
as
though
a
crime
lay
undiscovered
behind
the
silence
as
they
turned
into
the
ring
which
circles
the
inner
city
santa
woke
into
animation
leaning
from
the
window
she
pointed
you
see
that
huge
pile
like
a
palace
with
all
the
statues
and
the
steps
going
up
to
it
that
the
opera
house
i
danced
there
once
at
the
command
of
the
you
known
here
he
clutched
her
hand
she
shook
her
head
sadly
was
the
toast
of
europe
then
whereas
it
makes
a
in
the
they
drew
up
before
a
blazing
entrance
laughing
people
were
passing
in
and
out
women
muffled
in
costly
wraps
accompanied
by
men
in
this
the
change
was
so
sudden
that
it
shook
his
sense
of
reality
does
look
like
she
placed
her
lips
close
to
his
ear
as
she
alighted
looks
like
asking
for
revolution
me
the
deluge
you
remember
the
men
are
austrians
they
foreign
vultures
here
to
snatch
bargains
human
bargains
as
well
but
the
women
inside
the
doors
of
the
hotel
every
reminder
of
famine
had
been
blotted
out
its
white
marble
halls
and
stairways
were
richly
carpeted
its
furnishings
in
gilt
and
satin
had
been
carried
out
with
the
utmost
lavishness
the
costal
of
its
chandeliers
glittered
with
a
dazzling
intensity
from
the
restaurant
drifted
the
wild
gayety
of
a
gipsy
orchestra
the
atmosphere
with
the
yearning
of
elusive
romance
whispering
to
the
beat
of
the
music
came
the
glide
of
dancing
footsteps
flunkeys
with
powdered
heads
tricked
out
in
plush
breeches
like
marionettes
hurried
to
and
fro
on
errands
after
santa
had
been
shown
to
her
ornate
room
he
stepped
out
into
the
gloomy
street
to
assure
himself
it
was
all
true
in
spite
of
the
lie
which
he
had
witnessed
the
pinched
faces
were
still
there
and
the
enfeebled
bodies
crawling
through
the
shadows
as
he
reentered
the
white
glare
which
shone
from
the
hotel
he
glanced
back
with
a
sense
of
impending
ruin
for
a
second
time
his
mind
was
filled
with
a
tremendous
picture
there
was
a
certain
rich
man
and
a
beggar
named
lazarus
which
was
laid
at
his
gate
desiring
to
be
fed
moreover
the
dogs
came
and
licked
his
he
caught
the
vision
of
his
piling
up
stores
in
holland
at
the
thought
as
he
crept
between
the
sheets
in
his
comfortable
bed
he
sickened
ix
he
had
returned
from
a
disturbing
interview
with
the
austrian
ministers
responsible
for
considering
his
proposals
he
was
passing
the
hotel
desk
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
some
one
might
have
left
a
message
on
inquiry
two
were
handed
out
to
him
one
a
telegram
the
other
a
letter
ripping
open
the
telegram
a
glance
told
him
it
was
in
german
and
had
been
dispatched
from
budapest
he
had
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
thinking
have
to
get
santa
to
translate
that
when
he
unfolded
it
again
to
see
by
whom
it
had
been
sent
the
sender
name
was
a
single
word
his
heart
gave
a
bound
she
was
near
to
him
he
could
see
her
again
within
a
handful
of
hours
for
a
moment
nothing
else
seemed
to
matter
neither
santa
safety
nor
the
agony
of
hunger
by
which
he
was
surrounded
his
blood
ran
hot
with
yearning
how
had
she
reached
budapest
so
quickly
what
was
her
object
to
have
accomplished
the
journey
she
must
have
set
out
from
england
ahead
of
him
or
else
have
left
on
the
same
day
traveling
by
the
alternative
route
via
belgium
while
he
had
been
journeying
in
the
company
of
santa
going
through
the
mummery
of
pretending
he
was
married
anna
had
been
paralleling
his
footsteps
was
varensky
with
her
but
if
she
were
alone
mechanically
as
he
entered
the
elevator
he
slit
the
flap
of
the
letter
it
had
evidently
been
left
personally
for
it
bore
no
postmark
and
was
hastily
scrawled
on
the
stationery
of
the
hotel
the
hand
was
unknown
to
him
the
note
read
you
avoided
me
i
have
told
her
everything
i
am
more
sure
than
ever
you
ought
to
send
her
back
i
must
leave
you
now
for
a
little
while
when
we
meet
again
i
hope
it
will
be
as
at
last
they
had
got
rid
of
him
but
what
was
it
he
had
told
her
and
what
made
him
so
sure
that
they
would
meet
again
the
man
wrote
as
if
he
were
confident
that
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
them
at
any
moment
stepping
out
of
the
elevator
hindwood
made
directly
for
santa
room
he
recalled
it
vaguely
as
he
had
seen
it
the
night
before
with
its
empire
furniture
painted
cupids
silken
hangings
and
tall
mirrors
its
knowing
air
of
having
been
the
illicit
nest
of
innumerable
its
gaudy
luxury
so
glaringly
in
contrast
with
the
embittered
need
of
the
outside
world
had
stirred
his
anger
in
reply
to
his
knock
her
hoarse
voice
bade
him
enter
before
he
was
across
the
threshold
he
was
aware
of
the
intoxicating
fragrance
of
roses
just
inside
the
room
frowning
with
bewilderment
he
halted
there
were
stacks
of
them
sheaves
of
them
everywhere
they
were
scattered
on
the
floor
they
were
arranged
in
vases
they
lay
strewn
about
in
boxes
they
were
of
all
shades
and
varieties
the
meaning
she
beckoned
to
him
to
join
her
at
the
tall
window
against
which
she
was
standing
missed
this
last
she
pointed
following
her
direction
he
saw
that
the
window
looked
down
obliquely
on
the
imposing
architecture
of
the
opera
house
the
mellow
october
sunlight
drifted
softly
across
gray
roofs
and
fell
in
an
orange
splash
into
the
deep
fissure
of
the
street
below
along
the
pavements
the
tide
of
traffic
wandered
nervelessly
on
a
neighboring
ledge
two
plump
pigeons
were
engaged
in
an
ardent
courtship
did
we
miss
i
see
then
he
noticed
the
panting
of
her
bosom
and
that
her
expression
was
tender
with
tremulous
emotion
drawing
her
fine
fingers
across
her
eyes
she
shuddered
of
me
i
forgot
they
would
bring
back
nothing
to
you
the
scent
of
the
roses
and
then
the
opera
house
looking
the
same
as
ever
i
been
dreaming
of
other
mornings
when
i
woke
after
nights
of
triumph
perhaps
it
was
this
room
that
set
me
remembering
it
not
the
first
time
i
slept
in
as
she
caught
his
eyes
reading
her
memories
she
flushed
guiltily
in
those
days
i
was
never
the
roses
he
reminded
her
impatiently
did
you
get
them
at
the
price
things
cost
in
vienna
some
one
must
have
spent
a
she
placed
a
hand
on
his
arm
appealingly
begrudge
me
he
must
have
known
i
think
he
did
it
for
my
her
words
sent
a
chill
through
him
he
shifted
his
weight
uncomfortably
in
too
tight
a
corner
to
waste
energy
on
sentiment
if
going
to
make
a
fight
for
it
we
got
to
keep
our
heads
clear
who
gave
them
to
you
she
pressed
her
forehead
against
the
warm
pane
the
gold
of
the
world
outside
cast
a
sheen
of
gold
on
her
profile
her
unwanted
loveliness
hurt
him
it
reproached
him
it
recalled
to
him
the
ache
of
his
old
desire
in
the
days
before
he
had
known
that
he
could
have
her
and
now
that
he
could
have
her
for
the
asking
lajos
gave
them
to
me
they
been
arriving
ever
since
we
parted
he
waited
till
you
gone
then
he
came
to
me
he
came
to
tell
me
why
he
followed
me
he
was
persuaded
i
was
your
mistress
this
morning
he
did
something
noble
very
noble
for
a
man
of
his
sort
to
a
woman
of
mine
he
begged
me
to
become
his
knowing
anything
about
you
he
must
be
say
she
closed
her
eyes
painfully
sha
trouble
you
or
any
one
much
longer
i
shall
soon
be
so
still
when
one
sure
of
that
it
good
to
be
loved
just
once
again
even
though
she
turned
slowly
and
faced
him
do
need
to
tell
you
who
it
is
that
i
love
truly
this
man
he
nothing
no
man
ever
will
you
see
i
lived
for
men
and
admiration
for
things
like
she
pointed
to
the
roses
new
to
me
to
be
neglected
so
it
comforting
to
know
that
a
man
can
still
desire
me
even
though
i
rather
kill
myself
than
go
with
he
broke
the
silence
that
had
settled
between
them
must
talk
like
this
you
years
of
life
before
you
i
get
you
away
she
smiled
then
she
changed
the
subject
happened
to
you
mean
at
my
conference
he
seated
himself
beside
her
worst
that
could
have
happened
nothing
some
change
has
taken
place
for
which
i
ca
account
when
i
sent
my
suggestions
from
america
they
were
hailed
with
enthusiasm
i
was
a
saviour
everything
that
splendid
and
extravagant
but
now
the
government
paralyzed
it
is
a
government
it
a
passenger
let
us
starve
too
long
it
does
matter
now
that
what
i
was
told
this
morning
the
ministers
with
whom
i
consulted
spoke
as
if
they
were
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
volcano
waiting
to
be
blown
up
they
so
sure
that
an
eruption
inevitable
that
they
do
consider
it
worth
while
to
make
an
effort
to
save
themselves
i
could
rouse
them
when
i
pressed
them
for
the
cause
of
their
lethargy
they
prophesied
a
new
war
in
very
much
the
same
words
as
captain
lajos
a
war
in
which
the
are
to
be
pillaged
by
the
did
you
tell
them
that
you
could
ship
food
into
austria
at
once
told
them
i
assured
them
that
i
could
put
austria
back
on
her
feet
in
twelve
months
i
offered
to
provision
her
and
to
supply
coal
for
her
factories
if
they
give
me
control
of
the
railroads
and
a
per
capita
percentage
on
the
total
increase
of
national
industry
us
with
pleasure
was
their
attitude
raise
no
official
objection
kind
of
you
i
replied
where
do
i
come
in
i
no
philanthropist
he
brought
his
fist
down
with
a
bang
on
the
a
nigger
in
the
upon
my
soul
i
believe
those
fellows
are
determined
that
i
sha
prevent
their
nation
from
dying
if
i
shipped
them
the
food
as
a
gift
they
burn
she
came
over
from
the
window
and
stood
gazing
down
at
him
right
they
would
if
they
dared
ca
you
guess
ca
their
currency
hardly
worth
the
paper
it
printed
on
people
are
dropping
dead
in
the
streets
i
saw
them
their
gaols
are
packed
with
children
turned
criminals
through
hunger
there
be
no
crops
next
year
the
grain
consumed
that
should
have
been
saved
for
the
sowing
they
butchered
all
their
the
brains
of
the
country
are
in
exile
the
intellectual
classes
have
been
wiped
out
and
here
i
come
with
my
offer
to
save
them
and
they
reject
it
without
the
help
of
some
outside
force
like
myself
things
can
only
go
from
bad
to
he
glanced
up
irritated
by
the
promptitude
of
her
agreement
why
do
you
say
that
what
they
want
things
to
go
from
bad
to
worse
the
worse
things
get
the
more
certain
they
are
of
revolution
they
afraid
your
food
would
postpone
why
on
earth
they
hope
to
snatch
more
out
of
the
catastrophe
of
revolution
than
you
can
offer
them
these
ministers
with
whom
you
been
dealing
are
the
tools
of
the
exiled
monarchists
they
belong
to
the
party
in
all
countries
which
made
the
last
war
possible
and
all
wars
before
it
what
do
they
care
for
the
people
they
never
have
cared
let
the
brutes
starve
they
say
it
suits
our
purpose
we
can
always
breed
more
they
regard
the
people
as
their
serfs
to
be
fooled
with
patriotism
when
danger
threatens
and
to
be
kept
in
chains
to
toil
for
them
when
peace
has
been
restored
if
the
people
go
hungry
long
enough
they
reason
that
the
loss
of
their
kings
is
the
cause
they
rise
up
and
recall
them
they
start
to
die
for
them
afresh
it
happen
in
all
the
outcast
countries
in
the
wholesale
scramble
it
be
every
nation
for
itself
the
strong
will
struggle
to
expand
their
frontiers
and
the
weak
will
go
to
the
wall
the
deluge
of
blood
she
sank
to
her
knees
seizing
his
hands
imploringly
you
sacrifice
your
stores
of
food
you
can
stop
if
i
do
that
without
guaranties
i
bankrupt
i
get
get
more
than
i
got
when
to
accomplish
the
same
purpose
i
murdered
prince
rogovich
i
get
the
scaffold
you
earn
the
thanks
of
humanity
you
go
down
to
the
ages
he
could
see
only
the
wide
greyness
of
her
eyes
pleading
coercing
unbalancing
his
judgment
he
jumped
to
his
feet
shaking
off
their
spell
no
dreamer
no
varensky
he
said
gruffly
have
to
make
a
then
defending
himself
from
her
unspoken
accusation
only
guessing
we
have
no
facts
there
are
other
famished
countries
hungary
and
poland
what
austria
refuses
they
may
he
dug
his
hand
into
his
pocket
reminds
me
here
a
telegram
from
budapest
i
ca
understand
it
it
in
she
was
crouched
on
the
floor
as
he
stooped
to
give
it
to
her
she
caught
sight
of
the
signature
anna
varensky
must
be
with
her
then
the
crisis
is
nearer
than
i
it
tell
me
what
it
says
he
urged
she
looked
up
palely
wilted
with
disappointment
at
once
i
need
that
she
give
no
address
would
risk
it
i
know
where
to
find
we
start
what
about
he
did
not
hear
her
the
blood
was
hammering
in
his
temples
he
left
her
forgotten
seated
among
her
roses
the
music
of
a
wild
exultation
was
maddening
his
heart
chapter
the
seventh
the
capture
i
so
anna
had
turned
to
him
out
of
all
the
world
she
had
felt
so
sure
of
him
that
she
had
not
even
stated
the
reason
for
her
urgency
only
at
once
i
need
that
she
should
have
relied
so
implicitly
on
his
compliance
put
him
on
his
honor
not
to
disappoint
her
she
must
have
known
that
her
telegram
would
find
him
involved
in
important
business
the
earliest
she
could
have
counted
on
seeing
him
must
have
been
he
was
determined
if
it
were
humanly
possible
to
exceed
her
best
expectations
he
would
see
her
having
phoned
for
the
hotel
porter
to
be
sent
to
him
he
immediately
commenced
to
pack
he
recalled
the
message
that
santa
had
delivered
him
setting
out
on
his
last
journey
he
told
me
to
say
you
can
have
her
did
anna
telegram
mean
that
varensky
final
journey
was
ended
he
was
throwing
his
belongings
together
when
the
porter
entered
wanted
me
sir
what
the
first
train
the
fastest
to
budapest
first
if
it
still
running
starts
from
the
within
the
hour
but
order
me
a
taxi
i
be
ready
in
ten
minutes
have
my
bill
made
up
send
some
one
to
my
secretary
room
to
fetch
down
her
but
hindwood
glanced
at
the
man
coldly
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
for
a
little
later
as
he
was
pocketing
his
change
having
settled
his
account
the
cashier
addressed
him
he
shook
his
head
then
catching
sight
of
santa
he
beckoned
fellow
trying
to
say
something
find
out
troubling
the
cashier
repeated
more
earnestly
the
words
that
he
had
previously
uttered
wants
to
know
whether
you
really
think
you
can
leave
vienna
santa
translated
to
prevent
then
he
caught
her
arm
lowering
his
voice
they
on
to
the
was
extraordinarily
deserted
against
the
curb
a
wheezing
taxi
was
standing
the
only
one
in
sight
its
engine
was
running
the
bags
had
been
piled
on
the
front
seat
beside
the
driver
evidently
very
much
to
his
annoyance
he
was
doing
his
best
to
tumble
them
back
on
to
the
pavement
the
hotel
porter
was
vigorously
restraining
him
an
altercation
was
in
progress
which
threatened
any
minute
to
develop
into
a
fight
the
matter
the
porter
replied
across
his
shoulder
still
holding
the
bags
in
place
does
want
to
drive
him
i
give
him
five
times
the
legal
when
the
offer
had
been
translated
the
man
seemed
mollified
the
porter
opened
the
door
jump
in
before
he
changes
his
mind
he
promises
to
do
his
best
i
should
think
as
the
cab
moved
off
hindwood
missed
the
porter
parting
words
he
turned
to
santa
they
always
come
this
game
with
foreigners
in
vienna
is
a
game
he
did
want
to
drive
us
he
was
afraid
something
wrong
look
how
empty
the
streets
are
did
you
see
how
white
and
scared
every
one
was
in
the
hotel
the
cashier
would
have
told
us
you
would
even
let
me
listen
to
he
thought
be
awkward
having
to
take
care
of
both
her
and
they
had
driven
for
ten
minutes
in
silence
when
santa
spoke
again
a
queer
way
he
taking
queer
long
as
he
keeps
going
we
do
need
to
why
should
he
turn
up
all
the
do
know
it
be
time
to
grow
nervous
when
he
at
that
moment
he
stopped
but
it
was
only
for
a
second
spinning
his
cab
about
he
spurted
off
in
a
new
direction
glancing
from
the
window
as
he
turned
they
saw
that
the
main
thoroughfare
ahead
was
blocked
by
what
appeared
to
be
a
procession
street
after
street
he
tried
working
round
in
a
circle
never
getting
any
nearer
at
last
growing
desperate
he
took
the
plunge
tooting
his
horn
and
forcing
his
way
through
the
outskirts
of
the
seething
mob
by
the
time
hindwood
had
ordered
him
to
turn
back
it
was
too
late
for
a
hundred
yards
behind
them
from
pavement
to
pavement
the
thoroughfare
was
packed
with
pedestrians
and
vehicles
all
headed
in
the
one
direction
to
get
out
and
walk
even
if
they
had
been
willing
to
sacrifice
their
baggage
was
out
of
the
question
the
crowd
in
front
was
more
dense
than
the
crowd
behind
the
air
was
full
of
shrieks
of
fainting
women
and
the
shiver
of
as
gave
way
under
the
pressure
to
escape
the
crush
which
was
momentarily
increasing
people
were
clambering
to
the
roof
of
the
taxi
and
standing
thick
along
the
santa
was
speaking
in
a
torrent
to
the
strangers
clinging
to
the
doors
you
stop
long
enough
to
tell
me
what
happening
hindwood
interrupted
she
apologized
forgot
for
the
moment
that
you
ca
speak
german
they
as
puzzled
as
we
are
all
they
know
is
that
they
doing
what
every
one
else
is
doing
they
do
know
the
cause
the
same
happening
at
every
station
a
panic
struck
vienna
a
foreboding
of
disaster
it
a
case
of
nerves
in
some
places
looting
has
started
every
one
escaping
the
entire
population
it
anything
to
get
westward
to
france
switzerland
germany
away
from
this
nightmare
of
starvation
they
storming
the
trains
in
the
bahnhof
trying
to
compel
the
engineers
to
turning
from
him
she
commenced
to
ply
more
questions
in
her
hurried
flow
of
german
it
was
all
clear
now
the
porter
hesitancy
the
cashier
earnestness
the
driver
reluctance
they
had
been
trying
to
prevent
him
from
hurrying
a
woman
into
danger
he
had
been
too
obsessed
by
the
thought
of
reaching
anna
even
to
pay
attention
for
confirmation
of
what
santa
had
told
him
he
had
only
to
glance
at
the
surrounding
throng
the
lean
multitude
was
absurdly
prepared
for
its
futile
exodus
irrespective
of
class
every
individual
was
burdened
with
whatever
he
or
she
had
had
time
to
rescue
of
the
household
goods
they
carried
bundles
beneath
their
arms
and
sacks
on
their
backs
everything
on
wheels
had
been
commandeered
some
pushed
perambulators
piled
high
with
belongings
others
had
harnessed
themselves
to
carts
none
of
them
could
have
considered
whether
his
or
her
presence
would
be
allowed
in
a
happier
country
obviously
over
night
the
half
of
vienna
could
not
have
procured
the
necessary
permits
to
travel
on
the
outskirts
those
who
were
most
desperate
because
furthest
from
the
station
had
begun
to
charge
hindwood
watched
the
stampede
how
terror
was
transforming
forlorn
human
beings
into
animals
they
were
of
all
kinds
and
sorts
mechanics
waiters
merchants
with
here
and
there
a
sprinkling
of
patrician
faces
from
the
palaces
of
the
bankrupt
aristocracy
there
were
lonely
men
and
women
but
for
the
most
part
they
were
grouped
in
families
the
children
dragging
at
their
mother
skirts
and
the
youngest
in
the
father
arms
they
pushed
jostled
and
fought
trampling
the
weak
in
their
frenzy
to
get
forward
suddenly
the
madness
of
froze
with
horror
at
the
end
of
the
street
far
up
the
pale
river
of
gray
faces
horsemen
were
advancing
standing
tall
in
their
stirrups
smiting
with
their
swords
santa
flung
herself
to
the
floor
keep
down
the
children
oh
my
god
like
a
volley
of
hail
bullets
commenced
to
patter
they
whipped
the
street
from
end
to
end
hissing
in
their
flight
and
thudding
as
they
found
their
target
the
taxi
tossed
and
rocked
like
a
rowboat
in
a
the
mob
had
given
way
like
water
from
a
burst
dam
it
roared
between
the
tall
confining
houses
it
swept
backwards
weeping
bleeding
desperate
exhausted
wilder
in
its
retreat
than
it
had
been
in
its
advance
behind
it
came
the
cavalry
riding
it
down
firing
and
stabbing
in
five
minutes
nothing
was
in
sight
save
upset
vehicles
scattered
belongings
dead
lying
awkwardly
in
the
october
sunshine
and
wounded
crawling
weakly
in
search
of
refuge
reaching
through
the
shattered
window
hindwood
tapped
the
shoulder
at
the
touch
the
man
crumpled
there
was
a
crimson
blot
in
the
center
of
his
forehead
santa
sat
up
staring
furiously
you
not
refused
them
bread
did
you
were
only
willing
to
her
eyes
were
blazing
her
hands
were
clenched
her
tears
fell
slowly
in
the
terrific
silence
which
followed
so
much
clamor
the
street
itself
seemed
to
accuse
him
picking
up
their
bags
he
led
the
way
to
the
station
scenes
such
as
the
one
he
had
witnessed
might
be
happening
in
budapest
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
out
whether
it
possible
to
send
a
to
she
asked
suspiciously
for
you
need
to
ask
after
a
hurried
conversation
with
a
scared
official
she
turned
it
to
do
with

they
accept
it
the
lines
may
be
cut
at
any
he
dashed
off
his
telegram
sooner
than
expected
without
delay
start
under
armed
guard
for
budapest
and
it
might
spell
bankruptcy
for
him
the
ruin
of
all
his
plans
he
rebelled
against
the
improvidence
of
philanthropy
yet
dimly
he
discerned
the
proportions
of
his
chance
if
he
would
he
could
teach
the
world
how
wars
could
be
stopped
as
he
watched
the
message
being
dispatched
he
wondered
why
he
had
sent
it
was
he
frightened
by
the
sight
of
bloodshed
or
angered
like
varensky
by
an
unjust
display
of
force
or
had
he
sent
it
because
this
maelstrom
of
human
agony
swirled
between
him
and
the
woman
he
loved
and
food
might
prove
to
be
the
only
means
by
which
she
could
be
rescued
he
sought
to
explain
his
actions
by
business
motives
if
his
food
trains
were
actually
on
the
spot
he
could
strike
a
better
bargain
with
tottering
governments
ii
the
express
for
budapest
was
several
hours
late
when
at
last
it
got
under
way
it
carried
few
passengers
it
was
plunging
straight
into
the
heart
of
the
danger
from
which
all
the
world
which
possessed
the
price
of
a
fare
was
escaping
santa
listened
to
and
reported
on
the
conversation
of
they
were
hungarian
officers
returning
to
their
regiments
to
whom
a
fight
spelt
opportunity
they
were
husbands
and
fathers
careless
of
their
own
safety
in
their
dread
of
what
might
be
happening
to
their
families
they
were
merchants
and
men
of
wealth
anxious
to
be
at
hand
for
the
defense
of
their
possessions
as
the
talk
went
on
the
greatness
of
the
risk
grew
increasingly
obvious
it
bred
an
atmosphere
of
strangers
accosted
each
other
exchanging
views
on
the
hazards
they
crowded
about
the
entrance
of
any
compartment
where
a
speaker
seemed
possessed
of
accurate
information
most
of
what
was
said
was
no
more
than
conjecture
much
of
it
was
utterly
contradictory
one
man
asserted
that
the
bolsheviks
were
attacking
all
along
the
russian
front
another
that
bolshevism
had
collapsed
and
the
peasants
were
massacring
another
knew
for
certain
that
throughout
central
europe
the
reds
were
rising
yet
another
that
the
monarchists
had
sprung
to
arms
and
were
marching
every
rumor
or
invention
was
accepted
with
equal
credulity
anything
was
possible
no
one
knew
for
certain
either
the
magnitude
or
the
cause
of
the
rumored
disaster
only
one
fact
seemed
indisputable
somewhere
further
eastward
had
occurred
a
catastrophe
of
shattering
proportions
a
catastrophe
in
the
tragedy
of
which
each
one
of
them
would
shortly
be
involved
hindwood
turned
away
from
the
babel
of
voices
to
the
autumn
landscape
gliding
past
the
windows
it
consisted
as
far
as
eye
could
stretch
of
unboundaried
level
fields
gridironed
by
straight
military
roads
marked
by
avenues
of
pollarded
trees
intersecting
always
at
right
angles
the
fields
were
neglected
they
told
their
own
story
of
seed
consumed
which
should
have
been
saved
for
sowing
and
of
cattle
slaughtered
over
everything
despite
the
brilliant
blueness
of
the
sky
there
hung
an
atmosphere
of
melancholy
down
highways
little
groups
were
trekking
always
in
the
one
direction
they
appeared
crushed
and
harmless
more
like
insects
scarcely
human
they
limped
forlornly
dragging
carts
and
carrying
children
they
were
the
of
the
army
of
starvation
hindwood
remembered
the
captain
prophecy
march
to
the
lands
of
plenty
like
death
swinging
his
scythe
like
a
pestilence
like
gaunt
at
the
frontier
where
the
train
crossed
from
austria
into
hungary
he
gained
his
first
lesson
in
the
resistlessness
of
necessity
there
had
been
an
unequal
battle
in
which
only
one
side
had
been
armed
it
appeared
that
the
austrian
guards
had
tried
to
turn
back
the
hungarian
fugitives
they
had
fired
their
rifles
till
their
ammunition
was
exhausted
then
they
had
sickened
of
the
slaughter
opposition
had
made
no
difference
the
tide
of
fugitives
had
still
pressed
on
misery
had
proved
more
potent
than
explosives
it
had
made
death
if
not
desirable
at
least
negligible
its
meek
persistence
had
conquered
the
austrian
soldiery
had
revolted
against
their
officers
and
stood
with
grounded
arms
watching
the
stream
of
poverty
trickling
through
the
barrier
of
corpses
water
finding
its
own
level
hindwood
thought
it
would
be
like
this
the
world
over
if
something
were
not
done
at
once
to
check
it
the
outcast
nations
lay
one
behind
the
other
like
terraced
avalanches
in
an
ascending
scale
of
destitution
behind
the
austrians
the
hungarians
behind
the
hungarians
the
poles
behind
the
poles
the
russians
each
a
degree
more
agonized
in
its
privation
now
that
the
movement
had
started
it
would
go
on
sliding
filtering
settling
until
the
peoples
of
the
earth
had
regained
an
economic
level
the
dives
nations
which
had
refused
to
share
would
try
to
hold
the
lazarus
nations
at
bay
by
force
they
would
spray
them
with
cannon
they
would
charge
them
with
bayonets
they
would
bomb
them
gas
them
dig
labyrinths
of
trenches
in
the
end
as
had
happened
here
though
the
pariah
portion
of
humanity
was
weaponless
the
meek
persistency
of
its
misery
would
conquer
careless
of
oblivion
it
would
press
on
he
alone
could
give
the
dives
nations
a
seventh
hour
chance
at
the
price
of
his
financial
ruin
he
could
prevent
the
deluge
of
famine
from
spreading
by
damming
it
with
a
wall
of
bread
darkness
had
fallen
the
carriages
were
unlighted
the
train
was
moving
cautiously
jerking
stopping
starting
like
a
live
thing
scenting
carnage
scattered
through
the
night
were
burning
in
the
gloom
conversation
dragged
on
wearily
with
reiterated
guesses
he
felt
his
hand
clasped
is
it
he
whispered
you
wo
be
caught
now
as
safe
as
the
rest
of
us
no
one
have
time
to
remember
was
thinking
of
you
that
perhaps
you
were
born
for
such
a
time
as
he
drew
his
breath
the
echo
of
his
own
thought
perhaps
you
too
he
suggested
she
twisted
herself
leaning
her
breast
against
his
arm
glancing
down
through
the
darkness
he
caught
the
tenderness
in
her
eyes
and
the
gleaming
smoothness
of
her
cheek
and
throat
wish
i
could
believe
it
she
said
softly
stand
beside
you
making
you
strong
you
could
never
love
me
but
to
stand
beside
you
when
you
rescue
the
world
that
would
mean
i
rescue
the
world
he
laughed
quietly
no
varensky
i
came
here
to
make
she
swept
aside
his
cynicism
were
born
for
this
moment
and
i
an
outcast
woman
whom
the
world
has
hunted
will
help
you
perhaps
i
shall
give
my
life
for
she
spoke
exultantly
whom
you
have
exaggerate
things
may
not
be
as
bad
as
they
appear
what
seen
may
be
no
more
than
a
local
she
refused
to
argue
kind
to
me
while
we
on
the
outskirts
of
budapest
they
came
to
a
halt
the
air
was
tainted
with
a
nauseating
odor
standing
on
a
siding
was
a
long
line
of
in
process
of
being
shunted
by
the
light
of
lanterns
swung
by
men
on
the
tracks
it
was
possible
to
see
that
the
were
inhabited
figures
hung
out
of
them
thin
as
skeletons
entirely
naked
or
clad
in
flapping
rags
the
passengers
of
the
express
had
crowded
to
the
windows
pointing
commenting
gesticulating
hindwood
turned
to
santa
is
it
she
answered
bitterly
death
the
people
are
yet
they
families
ruined
by
the
war
and
by
the
peace
some
of
them
saw
their
homes
burned
by
the
cossacks
others
had
their
farms
stolen
to
pay
the
allies
debts
they
nobody
business
when
reached
the
end
of
your
tether
in
hungary
you
join
the
death
train
and
die
by
inches
you
have
no
food
no
sanitation
wherever
you
halt
you
spread
contagion
when
things
have
grown
too
bad
in
one
place
dragged
to
she
swallowed
down
a
sob
train
full
of
children
and
you
tell
me
that
you
came
here
to
make
on
arrival
at
budapest
they
found
the
station
picketed
by
soldiers
they
were
immediately
conducted
under
an
armed
guard
to
an
office
where
the
purpose
of
their
journey
was
investigated
when
hindwood
had
explained
their
errand
that
it
had
to
do
with
the
he
was
treated
with
courtesy
and
given
his
choice
of
hotels
santa
chose
the
ritz
a
military
order
was
made
out
for
their
rooms
a
was
handed
them
a
rickety
conveyance
with
a
lean
horse
between
the
shafts
was
allotted
to
them
they
were
launched
into
a
city
quenched
of
lights
with
a
soldier
seated
beside
the
driver
for
protection
the
wide
avenues
down
which
they
drove
were
deserted
they
were
still
unaware
of
what
had
happened
they
had
not
dared
to
ask
lest
any
slip
of
the
tongue
might
lead
to
trouble
there
were
no
signs
of
revolution
in
the
thoroughfares
they
were
hushed
and
reverent
as
the
aisles
of
a
cathedral
every
few
hundred
yards
a
mounted
gendarme
rode
out
to
challenge
them
then
seeing
the
soldier
on
the
box
backed
into
the
shadows
only
one
disquieting
incident
occurred
the
uneasiness
which
it
caused
was
due
to
guilty
memories
rather
than
to
any
actual
menace
as
they
were
turning
towards
the
danube
they
heard
a
sharp
trotting
behind
them
a
closed
brougham
swept
past
drawn
by
a
pair
of
horses
the
equipage
was
one
which
must
formerly
have
belonged
to
the
royal
palace
it
was
the
ghost
of
a
forgotten
splendor
hindwood
rose
in
his
seat
to
watch
it
vanish
then
he
saw
something
that
made
him
catch
his
breath
running
between
its
wheels
was
a
russian
wolfhound
santa
heard
his
commotion
the
excitement
by
the
time
she
had
raised
herself
to
follow
his
glance
the
hint
of
peril
was
gone
the
next
moment
they
were
drawing
up
at
the
hotel
iii
again
as
the
door
swung
to
behind
them
they
were
greeted
by
sounds
of
merriment
and
dancing
only
here
the
abandon
was
wilder
than
at
vienna
hindwood
saw
at
a
glance
that
this
was
no
assemblage
of
alien
hucksters
drawn
from
all
the
world
to
gather
bargains
as
regards
the
men
they
were
and
smart
of
the
same
type
as
captain
lajos
the
sort
who
would
follow
the
game
to
the
last
throw
of
the
dice
many
of
them
had
made
no
attempt
to
disguise
their
profession
they
were
clad
in
gorgeous
uniforms
of
hungarian
regiments
long
since
ordered
disbanded
by
the
allies
their
breasts
were
ablaze
with
imperial
decorations
they
strode
the
marble
floors
with
the
clink
of
spurs
and
the
rattling
of
swords
while
they
drugged
the
midnight
hours
with
laughter
and
debauch
their
faces
were
feverish
with
listening
expectancy
the
expectancy
of
an
event
for
which
they
waited
the
women
looked
like
captives
of
a
raid
some
hung
back
timidly
some
were
bold
with
wine
all
were
weary
and
pinched
with
hunger
like
the
men
they
seemed
only
to
be
acting
a
part
in
the
midst
of
recklessness
they
would
give
way
to
distaste
as
though
remorseful
of
this
way
of
combating
starvation
with
the
stench
of
the
death
train
still
in
his
nostrils
hindwood
stared
at
the
spectacle
in
pity
and
disgust
while
rome
is
burning
he
muttered
his
elbow
was
jogged
by
a
individual
with
the
appeasing
manners
of
a
tailor
understand
english
what
is
it
you
desire
hindwood
swung
round
much
the
better
i
want
what
one
usually
wants
at
a
hotel
the
man
rubbed
his
hands
sir
we
full
up
every
room
in
fact
every
lounge
is
have
to
find
something
i
have
a
military
having
read
it
the
man
returned
the
slip
of
paper
different
you
here
on
government
business
for
the
same
purpose
as
these
other
gentlemen
i
take
it
hindwood
replied
on
government
that
case
i
give
you
a
room
in
the
basement
a
servant
my
last
it
all
i
have
to
two
rooms
are
necessary
i
have
my
secretary
with
me
this
the
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
demand
the
impossible
is
useless
who
knows
if
things
happen
i
may
be
able
to
give
you
more
rooms
than
you
require
for
the
present
seeing
that
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
arguing
hindwood
consented
to
the
arrangement
room
will
be
my
secretary
if
you
lend
me
blankets
i
find
a
place
in
the
the
room
proved
to
be
poor
in
the
extreme
nothing
but
four
bare
walls
and
an
iron
cot
when
he
had
turned
the
key
he
tiptoed
over
to
santa
this
monstrous
thing
for
which
they
waiting
this
something
that
may
happen
she
placed
her
hands
in
his
as
though
she
felt
the
need
of
protection
her
golden
face
was
tragic
his
common
sense
revolted
though
everything
seemed
to
prove
her
guess
correct
he
refused
to
accept
it
it
ca
be
what
would
any
one
gain
by
it
it
was
war
that
produced
all
this
hideous
mess
the
death
train
and
all
that
besides
how
can
people
fight
who
can
scarcely
crawl
they
have
one
foot
in
the
grave
already
ten
men
could
defeat
a
battalion
whatever
in
the
wind
it
is
war
to
launch
a
war
requires
you
it
always
money
to
launch
this
kind
of
a
war
requires
nothing
but
stepping
back
from
him
tempestuously
she
flung
herself
full
length
on
the
cot
her
face
was
hidden
buried
in
the
pillow
while
she
lay
there
tense
the
sound
of
advancing
and
retreating
tapped
dreamily
against
the
walls
it
spoke
to
him
of
romance
of
a
woman
he
could
love
and
of
passion
snatched
perilously
before
life
ended
in
a
mysterious
city
after
nightfall
she
had
raised
herself
and
was
regarding
him
feverishly
her
red
lips
were
parted
as
with
thirst
know
you
so
well
she
was
saying
softly
know
you
because
i
love
you
you
refuse
to
believe
it
war
because
you
would
be
able
to
sell
and
bargain
but
it
is
war
the
sort
of
war
we
saw
at
the
frontier
a
war
in
which
weaponless
millions
will
march
to
the
overthrow
of
embattled
he
spoke
patiently
unwilling
to
believe
it
war
because
i
ca
see
any
reason
for
reason
her
eyes
became
twin
storms
you
require
a
reason
if
you
seen
your
children
die
for
lack
of
bread
you
perish
gladly
if
you
could
first
tear
the
throat
out
of
one
person
who
was
too
well
he
went
and
stood
beside
her
stooping
over
her
placing
his
hand
against
her
forehead
burning
you
been
through
too
much
get
some
rest
we
find
anna
and
perhaps
it
more
than
likely
they
be
able
to
tell
he
paused
know
what
makes
you
so
relentless
it
your
own
dead
child
her
arms
shot
up
dragging
him
down
and
nestling
his
face
against
her
breast
my
man
it
not
that
it
that
i
jealous
for
you
so
afraid
you
may
deceive
yourself
and
miss
your
he
stumbled
back
from
the
temptation
of
her
yielding
body
and
the
comfort
of
her
fragrant
warmth
chance
is
yours
we
may
both
have
been
born
for
this
long
after
he
had
stretched
himself
outside
her
door
he
felt
that
in
the
austerity
of
the
four
bare
walls
she
still
crouched
watching
from
her
bed
iv
he
slept
restlessly
the
music
and
the
dancing
rarely
halted
once
when
he
roused
it
was
with
the
suffocating
sense
that
a
man
was
bending
over
him
fumbling
at
the
handle
of
santa
door
as
he
sat
up
he
was
convinced
that
the
man
looked
back
just
before
he
vanished
around
the
corner
when
he
finally
wakened
it
was
in
the
chill
of
dawn
he
was
surrounded
by
a
ghostly
stillness
rising
softly
he
slipped
down
the
passage
and
out
into
the
public
rooms
of
the
hotel
it
was
as
though
a
wizard
had
waved
his
wand
the
lay
strewn
about
carelessly
wherever
sleep
had
overtaken
them
in
the
pale
light
of
morning
robbed
of
animation
their
faces
showed
waxlike
and
wan
swords
which
had
clattered
martially
sprawled
grotesquely
by
crumpled
bodies
uniforms
looked
tarnished
dresses
shabby
girls
with
their
lips
parted
and
their
hair
disordered
lay
with
heads
stretched
back
in
their
arms
over
all
was
spread
the
weariness
of
folly
tiptoeing
from
group
to
group
he
searched
for
the
man
who
had
tried
santa
door
nowhere
could
he
find
him
returning
to
her
room
he
tapped
lightly
he
was
afraid
to
make
more
noise
in
that
atmosphere
of
menace
receiving
no
answer
he
pushed
the
door
stealthily
and
peered
across
the
threshold
he
had
feared
lest
he
might
find
her
gone
there
she
lay
curled
up
in
her
cot
her
hair
poured
across
her
pillow
her
face
cushioned
against
her
hollowed
arm
gray
light
falling
from
a
narrow
window
clothed
her
with
a
lonely
pathos
bending
over
her
he
shook
her
shoulder
she
sat
up
with
a
start
it
happened
yet
they
sleeping
like
the
why
someone
who
knows
us
here
he
tried
your
door
it
makes
me
think
we
watched
we
can
slip
out
now
and
hunt
up
varensky
if
we
wait
till
later
we
be
her
pupils
dilated
obscuring
the
grayness
of
her
eyes
they
became
black
pools
mirroring
her
terror
be
caught
with
varensky
would
mean
he
seated
himself
on
the
edge
of
her
cot
did
think
you
knew
what
fear
was
do
be
frightened
i
protect
all
of
a
sudden
she
had
become
intensely
calm
you
think
i
was
afraid
for
myself
before
many
days
perhaps
before
is
out
it
be
you
who
need
protecting
i
beg
you
do
go
near
me
go
myself
she
implored
when
he
glanced
away
without
replying
she
rushed
on
impetuously
one
got
to
take
risks
i
do
count
your
life
must
be
with
an
effort
he
brought
his
gaze
back
instead
of
the
explosion
he
had
expected
her
voice
became
gravely
tender
forgot
you
care
for
her
as
i
care
for
you
i
her
feet
slipped
to
the
floor
he
saw
them
marble
white
against
the
bare
scrubbed
boards
beautiful
as
hands
the
feet
of
a
dancer
as
he
retreated
she
smiled
bravely
sha
wait
v
so
far
as
they
were
aware
no
one
had
noticed
their
departure
the
deep
breathing
of
the
motley
throng
had
been
like
the
beat
of
a
muffled
engine
even
the
who
should
have
been
on
guard
had
collapsed
across
his
desk
with
his
face
buried
in
his
arms
they
had
stepped
out
of
the
hotel
into
a
pulseless
street
where
mists
from
the
danube
hung
like
cobwebs
hindwood
could
not
rid
himself
of
the
suspicion
that
they
were
followed
he
glanced
back
repeatedly
drawing
santa
sharply
into
doorways
in
attempt
after
attempt
to
trap
the
tracker
if
a
tracker
there
was
he
never
revealed
himself
at
last
hindwood
realized
that
precautions
were
profitless
the
cessation
of
their
own
footsteps
gave
ample
warning
a
pursuer
had
only
to
halt
when
they
halted
to
escape
detection
behind
the
fog
they
scarcely
dared
talk
and
then
only
in
brief
whispers
it
puzzled
him
how
she
could
keep
her
direction
it
was
like
tunneling
a
passage
through
chalk
which
crumbled
yielded
and
caved
in
as
one
went
forward
the
whole
world
dripped
sullenly
unseen
gutters
unseen
trees
treacherous
pavements
and
there
was
always
the
drifting
whiteness
pricking
one
eyes
as
with
little
darts
she
had
gone
too
far
and
turned
back
feeling
her
way
along
the
wall
before
a
large
she
paused
and
knocked
she
rapped
three
times
peculiarly
before
a
grill
was
slipped
back
and
a
question
asked
the
answer
which
she
gave
appeared
to
be
the
countersign
a
smaller
door
in
the
doubledoor
was
opened
and
they
entered
the
person
who
had
admitted
them
was
a
new
type
to
hindwood
flat
featured
clad
in
a
loose
khaki
shirt
which
bulged
like
a
blouse
and
in
a
pair
of
baggy
breeches
which
were
tucked
into
roomy
as
pouches
but
it
was
the
expression
of
the
man
that
was
most
impressive
his
brooding
appearance
of
enormous
patience
santa
spoke
rapidly
in
a
language
which
was
neither
german
nor
french
the
man
nodded
and
led
the
way
across
a
gloomy
courtyard
up
stairs
rotten
with
decay
into
a
stone
corridor
lined
with
stout
forbidding
doors
it
a
prison
hindwood
whispered
better
it
a
barracks
inhabited
by
the
brains
of
outcast
russia
students
for
the
most
part
male
and
female
who
have
escaped
from
the
red
terror
russia
has
no
use
for
brains
at
present
brains
are
too
dangerous
wherever
the
bolshevist
finds
them
he
blows
them
out
many
of
these
exiles
are
survivors
of
denikin
and
kolchak
armies
having
tried
to
save
their
country
with
rifles
they
now
preparing
themselves
to
rescue
her
with
knowledge
they
learning
to
be
doctors
engineers
and
lawyers
so
that
they
may
become
the
soul
of
the
russia
of
the
future
meanwhile
they
live
anyhow
sleep
anywhere
and
starve
abominably
they
not
wanted
in
hungary
or
in
any
european
country
they
suspected
and
hounded
the
only
reason
they
been
allotted
this
mildewed
dwelling
is
in
order
that
they
may
be
the
guide
had
thrown
open
a
door
and
stood
signing
to
them
trying
to
catch
their
attention
it
was
a
grim
sight
that
met
their
eyes
similar
to
the
one
they
had
left
behind
at
the
hotel
only
a
thousand
times
more
sordid
the
windows
were
locked
and
heavily
barred
the
air
was
poisonous
the
room
was
stripped
of
furnishings
on
bare
boards
innumerable
human
beings
without
a
shred
of
bedding
sprawled
drugged
with
sleep
herded
together
in
indecent
proximity
there
was
scarcely
space
to
walk
between
them
they
were
of
both
sexes
here
and
there
a
child
lay
folded
in
a
parent
arms
the
men
were
of
all
ages
but
for
the
most
part
young
and
still
in
the
tattered
uniforms
of
their
defeated
armies
the
women
were
scarcely
distinguishable
from
the
men
their
heads
were
cropped
they
wore
odd
garments
of
mixed
masculine
and
feminine
attire
such
as
could
be
purchased
for
next
to
nothing
at
any
some
retained
the
of
the
battalions
of
death
as
hindwood
gazed
across
the
pool
of
faces
help
us
if
this
is
the
soul
of
the
future
russia
he
thought
suddenly
his
interest
shifted
in
the
corner
remotest
from
the
door
his
eye
had
caught
the
shining
of
golden
tresses
their
owner
face
was
turned
away
from
him
they
seemed
to
weigh
her
down
and
were
piled
beneath
her
head
in
a
cushion
on
her
left
lay
an
aged
peasant
woman
on
her
right
a
man
with
a
face
and
a
head
that
was
peaked
like
a
dunce
cap
the
guide
was
already
stooping
over
the
man
touching
him
with
a
strange
reverence
the
man
sat
up
his
green
eyes
opened
hindwood
experienced
the
same
sensation
of
discomfort
he
had
felt
when
he
had
first
seen
them
peering
at
him
above
the
edge
of
the
cliff
at
seafold
varensky
had
risen
with
his
peculiarly
catlike
motion
he
was
picking
a
path
towards
them
he
held
out
his
hand
was
brave
of
you
to
and
then
to
santa
you
too
but
of
you
it
was
hindwood
bristled
like
a
dog
he
was
distrustful
of
romantic
attitudes
get
down
to
facts
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
it
was
any
lofty
motive
that
brought
the
arched
themselves
comically
what
wife
i
understand
she
did
tell
me
you
see
she
thinks
i
going
to
get
myself
killed
at
last
probably
she
wants
you
to
help
stop
me
not
that
i
of
the
least
use
to
her
do
think
that
but
she
the
soul
of
honor
my
death
would
mean
her
freedom
because
of
that
she
do
anything
in
her
power
to
prevent
hindwood
drew
himself
erect
are
matters
which
it
not
decent
for
us
to
the
narrow
shoulders
flew
up
into
a
shrug
on
earth
not
when
things
are
so
there
can
be
nothing
indecent
in
being
frank
about
them
is
it
less
indecent
for
you
to
love
my
wife
than
for
me
to
tell
that
i
know
you
love
her
there
be
no
sense
in
your
loving
her
unless
you
both
hoped
i
wo
finish
what
i
was
going
to
say
your
feelings
are
so
he
rested
his
hand
not
unkindly
on
hindwood
arm
you
realize
my
dear
fellow
that
you
to
be
congratulated
this
happening
which
means
catastrophe
for
countless
millions
for
you
and
anna
spells
opportunity
be
honest
you
would
not
have
risked
visiting
me
if
you
had
not
realized
hindwood
sought
for
spitefulness
in
varensky
tones
all
he
found
was
the
surge
of
a
quiet
happiness
would
think
that
i
wanted
you
to
die
he
exclaimed
blankly
do
you
why
should
you
smiled
sadly
i
could
love
anna
or
any
other
woman
the
way
you
do
but
no
to
me
such
affections
have
been
denied
i
love
people
only
in
crowds
by
tens
of
thousands
and
by
nations
in
my
heart
there
no
room
for
more
human
passions
i
god
instrument
the
hour
of
my
testing
is
at
hand
these
mildewed
walls
inclose
my
he
flung
his
arms
apart
grotesquely
they
formed
with
his
body
the
shape
of
a
cross
the
fire
of
fanaticism
blazed
in
his
eyes
i
shall
be
he
drew
a
shuddering
breath
born
actor
was
hindwood
silent
comment
egoist
who
craves
the
and
yet
to
his
chagrin
he
found
himself
impressed
he
was
so
deeply
stirred
that
he
dared
not
trust
himself
to
speak
for
a
moment
when
he
did
it
was
with
calculated
coldness
think
only
of
yourself
it
not
you
alone
even
those
of
us
who
make
no
claim
to
be
god
instruments
stand
more
than
a
sporting
chance
of
being
crucified
as
you
call
it
there
are
santa
and
anna
for
instance
there
the
collection
of
wretched
gathered
in
this
building
there
are
the
scarecrows
i
saw
in
the
death
train
there
are
all
the
teeming
swarms
of
human
lice
crawling
westward
along
a
thousand
roads
in
the
presence
of
an
agony
so
widespread
i
muster
a
tear
for
your
individual
tragedy
it
no
time
for
for
an
instant
varensky
gaunt
face
quivered
making
an
effort
with
an
air
of
mocking
courtliness
he
mastered
his
injured
pride
was
mistaken
and
i
ask
your
pardon
we
all
have
our
plans
to
make
ahead
i
supposed
you
were
here
to
ascertain
approximately
the
hour
at
which
i
proposed
to
shall
we
say
depart
were
badly
mistaken
hindwood
cut
in
contemptuously
here
to
find
out
if
there
any
possible
way
in
which
we
can
save
the
varensky
stared
he
became
rigid
as
though
he
were
carved
from
marble
he
repeated
haughtily
while
hindwood
was
searching
for
a
clue
to
his
amazement
his
next
words
supplied
it
thought
it
was
i
who
was
to
save
the
you
have
a
plan
varensky
eyes
filmed
over
but
if
i
were
to
tell
you
you
would
coming
out
of
the
clouds
he
placed
his
hand
tolerantly
on
shoulder
you
said
so
you
want
me
to
have
a
plan
let
sit
down
and
talk
more
quietly
these
people
are
tired
in
sleep
they
forget
so
you
also
have
ambitions
to
become
a
saviour
it
was
like
the
night
in
the
hut
all
over
again
when
they
had
talked
of
santa
redemption
there
he
sat
this
discredited
dictator
his
knees
drawn
sharply
up
to
his
chin
his
white
face
peering
over
them
the
stale
air
sighed
with
the
breathing
of
sleepers
a
child
whimpered
and
was
hugged
closer
to
the
breast
in
the
far
corner
lay
the
desired
woman
gazing
eagerly
into
both
their
eyes
was
the
oriental
countenance
of
the
other
woman
for
whom
neither
of
them
cared
saviour
no
i
have
no
ambitions
in
that
direction
but
i
have
a
scheme
hindwood
admitted
is
it
i
came
to
sell
bread
for
in
austria
i
found
the
government
unwilling
to
purchase
this
morning
when
i
consult
with
hungarian
officials
i
may
be
met
with
the
same
refusal
what
the
game
why
should
men
in
control
of
hungry
nations
refuse
my
help
for
six
months
they
been
urging
me
to
come
to
them
happened
the
signs
of
it
are
everywhere
trains
running
westward
are
packed
with
women
the
last
sight
we
had
of
vienna
was
a
and
people
brutally
shot
down
and
again
at
the
frontier
there
were
piles
of
dead
not
only
men
women
and
children
who
had
been
butchered
to
prevent
them
from
escaping
budapest
under
military
law
by
some
error
santa
and
i
on
arrival
were
mistaken
for
conspirators
in
an
army
plot
billeted
at
what
appears
to
be
its
headquarters
a
place
jammed
with
carousing
officers
of
supposedly
disbanded
regiments
what
in
the
air
what
is
this
dreadful
news
which
some
people
rejoice
over
from
which
others
flee
in
panic
but
which
no
one
dares
to
mention
if
you
can
tell
me
i
shall
know
how
to
i
can
tell
you
suppose
i
were
to
tell
you
the
worst
how
would
you
act
then
depends
i
no
more
unselfish
than
anybody
else
at
a
pinch
i
could
forget
my
own
interests
and
ruin
myself
for
the
public
welfare
here
how
i
stand
i
have
enough
food
at
my
command
to
keep
europe
for
several
weeks
from
actual
starvation
if
the
crisis
is
genuine
that
ought
to
give
time
for
the
conscience
of
the
civilized
world
to
be
aroused
but
even
if
the
world
conscience
should
prove
too
sluggish
i
still
have
a
personal
fortune
which
would
keep
hunger
at
bay
for
several
months
i
no
philanthropist
i
should
make
myself
penniless
reluctantly
i
in
no
sense
your
rival
for
the
honors
of
calvary
my
mission
in
europe
is
to
sell
at
a
profit
so
if
you
can
do
better
you
telling
me
varensky
interrupted
that
if
by
personal
sacrifice
you
could
avert
a
world
disaster
you
be
willing
to
give
something
for
but
i
must
first
be
convinced
that
the
circumstances
warrant
one
point
you
green
eyes
narrowed
to
the
moment
you
entered
this
room
i
was
fully
persuaded
that
i
was
the
man
on
whom
the
privilege
of
paying
the
price
must
fall
coveted
the
privilege
all
my
life
i
worked
for
it
if
you
rob
me
of
it
have
you
reckoned
the
cost
money
something
more
valuable
if
i
live
you
can
never
be
hindwood
hated
the
man
for
his
subtlety
he
was
being
deliberately
tempted
he
threw
a
glance
toward
the
sleeping
woman
in
the
corner
whose
fate
as
well
as
his
own
he
was
deciding
close
to
him
drawing
nearer
he
saw
the
pleading
eyes
of
santa
he
gave
his
answer
may
be
the
man
who
was
born
for
this
moment
play
fair
by
me
tell
me
what
varensky
rocked
himself
slowly
back
and
forth
suddenly
he
came
to
rest
the
thing
that
happened
i
responsible
for
everything
never
learnt
to
let
bad
alone
in
trying
to
make
things
better
i
make
them
worse
it
was
my
hand
that
shot
down
the
crowd
at
vienna
it
was
i
who
butchered
the
women
and
children
at
the
frontier
i
the
force
which
drives
behind
the
human
lice
who
crawl
westward
along
a
thousand
roads
you
think
me
mad
but
listen
every
freedom
gained
entails
a
new
bondage
i
helped
to
free
russia
from
the
czar
in
so
doing
i
prepared
the
way
for
bolshevism
i
fought
bolshevism
with
my
dreams
my
happiness
with
everything
i
possess
bolshevism
is
overthrown
what
have
i
produced
then
that
the
meaning
of
santa
had
half
risen
varensky
turned
his
face
on
her
chilling
her
enthusiasm
collapsed
like
a
pack
of
cards
with
it
have
vanished
the
last
of
the
restraints
every
russian
his
own
master
now
to
choose
his
own
ditch
in
which
to
perish
we
destroyed
a
vision
that
turned
out
to
be
a
nightmare
but
we
set
up
nothing
in
its
stead
we
who
are
idealists
have
worked
the
final
disillusion
we
made
two
hundred
millions
hopeless
they
fleeing
from
the
emptiness
the
contagion
of
their
despair
is
spreading
you
saw
its
results
in
vienna
it
runs
ahead
of
them
they
already
on
the
march
they
broken
into
poland
they
drawing
nearer
how
to
stop
them
hindwood
lips
had
squared
themselves
can
stop
them
my
will
be
here
by
tomorrow
what
hungry
men
need
is
not
political
programs
but
then
he
added
thoughtfully
can
stop
them
if
i
not
prevented
there
some
one
who
playing
a
different
game
some
one
who
wants
the
world
to
starve
that
what
austria
refusal
meant
that
the
meaning
of
these
secret
signs
of
rejoicing
bigger
than
any
nation
who
is
he
varensky
shook
his
head
was
a
he
looked
knowingly
at
santa
was
hindwood
jumped
to
his
feet
as
though
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
going
to
find
out
i
have
an
appointment
with
the
governor
of
hungary
if
he
rejects
my
offer
i
shall
demand
if

refuses
shall

me
what
it

if
i
play
it
i
shall
need
your

you
talked
of
crucifixion
i
may
provide
you
with
the
chance
how
many
of
these
he
pointed
to
the
sleeping
outcasts
varensky
eyes
were
shining
four
hundred
three
hundred
veterans
of
denikin
and
kolchak
armies
and
a
hundred
of
the
battalions
of
them
as
he
turned
on
his
heel
he
saw
that
anna
had
wakened
she
cried
out
after
him
he
dared
not
face
her
leaping
down
the
stairs
he
went
at
a
run
across
the
courtyard
it
was
only
when
the
door
into
the
street
had
closed
behind
him
that
he
realized
that
santa
was
panting
at
his
elbow
vi
mists
were
clearing
the
sun
had
emerged
fiery
above
a
of
clouds
as
they
hurried
in
search
of
their
hotel
they
caught
glimpses
of
the
danube
spanned
by
many
bridges
and
on
the
further
bank
the
heights
of
buda
the
ancient
city
looked
imperially
beautiful
there
was
a
touch
of
the
east
about
it
a
lavishness
and
whiteness
its
quays
and
pavements
shone
wet
as
though
they
had
been
daubed
with
lacquer
it
seemed
incredible
that
behind
its
walls
the
ghosts
of
hunger
gathered
during
their
absence
from
the
ritz
a
transformation
had
been
effected
all
signs
of
disorder
had
been
banished
in
place
of
the
untimely
bacchanalians
waiters
stood
guard
over
neat
tables
with
a
solicitous
air
which
was
bewilderingly
normal
even
the
breakfast
menu
gave
the
lie
to
starvation
they
took
their
seats
in
silence
eating
without
interest
whatever
was
set
before
them
hindwood
sensations
were
those
of
a
man
who
has
given
way
to
his
emotions
at
a
theatre
it
was
as
though
the
lights
had
gone
up
shaming
him
in
public
there
had
been
nothing
to
warrant
his
surrender
to
sentiment
he
totaled
up
the
accumulated
incentives
he
had
witnessed
a
people
slain
at
the
frontier
the
hideous
contrast
between
the
death
train
and
dancing
and
last
of
all
varensky
but
these
things
in
themselves
constituted
no
argument
the
cause
that
lay
behind
them
was
still
conjectural
as
for
varensky
whatever
he
had
said
was
unreliable
his
wish
was
parent
to
his
thought
he
was
a
man
born
to
stir
up
turbulences
which
he
considered
it
his
mission
to
pacify
he
was
dangerous
as
a
one
spark
of
his
wild
idealism
made
the
whole
world
lurid
in
the
breath
of
adversity
he
became
a
sheet
of
flame
destructive
and
his
goal
was
the
in
the
no
man
land
between
desire
and
things
attainable
hindwood
writhed
at
remembering
the
ease
with
which
his
judgment
had
been
unseated
in
his
weakness
he
had
given
a
promise
which
it
would
be
folly
to
fulfill
and
dishonorable
to
withdraw
he
glanced
across
at
santa
how
was
she
taking
this
return
to
normality
she
met
his
eyes
with
passionate
adoration
was
of
he
pretended
ignorance
you
given
up
everything
anna
ambition
money
all
the
things
you
he
assumed
a
judicial
expression
not
it
may
be
it
it
is
he
said
shall
stick
to
my
contract
but
i
reason
to
believe
we
to
god
we
had
her
fervor
disturbed
him
he
leaned
across
the
table
do
mean
to
tell
me
you
accept
this
bogey
story
about
starving
millions
marching
there
a
sense
of
security
this
morning
surely
you
must
have
felt
it
she
shook
her
head
had
a
meal
that
all
within
a
mile
from
here
i
could
show
you
a
hospital
where
five
hundred
babies
sit
shivering
like
monkeys
they
wrapped
in
paper
they
never
known
what
it
was
not
to
be
hungry
from
the
day
they
were
born
i
could
take
you
to
the
workmen
quarter
where
naked
men
and
women
would
squirm
at
your
feet
like
dogs
they
too
weak
to
walk
i
could
lead
you
past
the
already
forming
he
stayed
her
by
covering
her
hand
not
denying
it
when
countries
make
wars
they
have
to
pay
the
storm
that
was
brewing
betrayed
itself
in
her
eyes
are
you
denying
let
make
a
scene
he
urged
promise
holds
if
i
find
that
circumstances
warrant
it
in
a
little
while
i
seeing
the
governor
of
hungary
after
that
i
be
sure
while
i
gone
i
have
one
request
to
make
of
you
keep
your
room
and
talk
to
she
rose
from
the
table
in
suppressed
defiance
your
own
safety
it
was
lucky
i
slept
across
your
threshold
last
night
your
door
was
her
smile
accused
him
whom
i
not
mistaken
by
the
man
who
afterwards
tracked
us
through
the
she
turned
away
as
though
she
were
finished
with
him
when
she
found
that
he
was
following
she
delivered
a
parting
shot
told
me
this
to
frighten
me
did
you
think
you
could
make
me
your
accomplice
in
cowardice
vii
so
these
were
the
rewards
of
in
his
anger
he
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
her
he
was
free
at
last
she
been
nothing
but
an
embarrassment
if
she
were
to
attempt
a
reconciliation
he
would
turn
his
back
on
her
it
was
likely
that
he
put
his
neck
into
the
same
noose
twice
little
by
little
from
resenting
her
he
began
to
suspect
her
had
she
been
using
him
as
a
in
a
deeper
game
every
man
with
whom
she
had
ever
associated
she
had
destroyed
could
she
be
expected
to
show
more
mercy
to
a
man
by
whom
she
had
been
rejected
her
husband
words
came
back
she
has
added
you
to
her
list
of
victims
if
she
gives
you
time
before
she
kills
you
remember
that
i
warned
everything
to
do
with
her
became
distorted
when
interpreted
in
the
light
of
treachery
the
pathos
of
her
unrequited
affection
had
been
a
mask
her
humanitarianism
had
been
a
cloak
for
her
designs
when
he
retraced
his
relations
with
her
it
seemed
glaringly
probable
that
from
the
start
she
had
been
the
agent
of
his
financial
rivals
placed
by
them
on
board
the
with
the
definite
intention
of
accomplishing
his
ruin
except
for
her
final
error
in
tactics
she
would
have
attained
her
object
he
had
escaped
by
the
narrowest
of
margins
but
the
other
people
who
had
come
upon
the
scene
where
did
they
stand
were
they
her
puppets
jumping
whichever
way
she
pulled
the
wires
or
were
they
her
active
varensky
and
the
little
grandmother
were
undoubtedly
her
puppets
she
employed
their
enthusiasms
to
serve
her
purposes
anna
was
her
victim
a
woman
wronged
and
cheated
infinitely
dear
to
him
and
tragic
it
was
captain
lajos
who
troubled
him
the
more
he
thought
about
him
the
more
certain
he
became
that
the
captain
and
santa
were
hand
in
glove
the
farce
which
they
had
enacted
on
the
train
had
been
prearranged
with
a
view
to
intimidating
him
his
most
unnerving
information
concerning
the
menace
of
starving
millions
had
come
from
the
captain
and
there
was
a
further
fact
which
had
been
disquieting
him
all
morning
it
was
captain
lajos
who
had
tried
door
last
night
what
did
they
think
to
gain
by
their
plotting
having
pondered
the
conundrum
he
decided
that
their
object
was
to
thwart
his
schemes
for
grasping
and
that
the
means
they
had
chosen
were
to
compel
him
to
give
for
nothing
the
hoards
of
food
which
he
had
intended
that
europe
should
buy
well
aware
that
this
theory
was
far
from
covering
all
the
facts
he
was
still
feeling
his
way
through
a
quagmire
of
surmise
when
a
visitor
was
announced
in
the
foyer
he
found
an
officer
resplendently
uniformed
waiting
to
escort
him
to
his
audience
at
the
royal
palace
he
was
whizzed
away
in
a
handsome
car
as
he
traveled
his
companion
entertained
him
with
anecdotes
grimly
humorous
of
bela
kun
reign
of
terror
of
that
sort
soon
disprove
themselves
he
said
cheerfully
live
through
them
and
go
on
your
country
is
going
on
again
hindwood
inquired
signs
of
revival
are
already
what
about
russia
how
revival
possible
without
security
the
officer
laughed
carelessly
catch
your
meaning
you
heard
this
latest
about
bolshevism
downfall
in
our
part
of
the
world
we
pay
no
heed
to
rumors
they
inventions
of
political
opportunists
or
of
gamblers
in
the
international
exchange
even
if
this
latest
is
true
it
the
best
thing
that
could
have
hindwood
twisted
in
his
seat
that
he
might
lose
nothing
of
his
companion
expression
best
thing
in
the
long
run
that
granted
but
meanwhile
because
of
the
breakdown
in
organization
over
a
hundred
million
russians
are
likely
to
again
the
officer
laughed
stretching
his
long
legs

has
to

the
last

was
fought
because
the
world
was
too
crowded
famine

for
the
remark
sounded
singularly
coming
from
a
man
whose
country
was
also
starving
hindwood
frowned
heartless
cure

thank

not
the
only
more
heartless
than
civilized
society
which
encourages
armed
nations
to
strangle
each
other
with
every
filthy
invention
of
science
when
you
forbid
nature
to
correct
matters
in
her
own
way
sooner
or
later
you
find
yourself
with
a
war
on
your
hands
the
matter
very
simple
so
many

to
fill
and
so
many
rations
when
the

are
in
excess
of
the
rations
some
one
has
to
go

the

either

hindwood
suggested
quietly
of

does
seem
to
trouble
natural
killing
and
dying
are
my
brutal
as
was
the
point
of
view
after
santa
sentimental
fallacies
there
was
something
honest
and
direct
about
these
bald
assertions
hindwood
spoke
again
applies
to
russia
applies
equally
to
hungary
my
errand
at
the
palace
is
to
offer
sufficient
food
to
keep
your
country
alive
according
to
your
theory
i
interfering
with
nature
laws
i
doing
something
economically
immoral
i
ought
to
leave
you
to
your
to
his
amazement
he
was
met
with
a
polite
concurrence
how
i
regard
it
was
impossible
to
credit
the
man
sincerity
hindwood
glanced
aside
irritated
and
shocked
he
was
seeking
a
motive
for
such
disinterested
frankness
there
was
nothing
more
to
say
he
had
been
so
much
absorbed
in
the
conversation
that
he
had
not
noticed
their
direction
they
were
skimming
high
above
the
danube
crossing
a
bridge
that
spanned
the
sunlit
gulf
in
giant
strides
behind
lay
pest
modern
as
a
second
paris
in
front
lay
buda
ancient
and
scarcely
christian
still
bearing
the
marks
of
its
turkish
occupation
on
reaching
the
further
bank
the
ascent
to
the
palace
begun
to
climb
it
was
just
as
they
were
reaching
the
top
that
hindwood
was
for
a
second
time
startled
by
the
ghost
of
memory
peering
down
on
him
from
the
ramparts
with
its
head
between
its
paws
was
a
russian
the
next
moment
they
had
passed
beneath
an
arch
between
saluting
sentries
and
had
halted
in
the
viii
the
yard
was
an
immobile
sea
of
faces
as
far
as
eye
could
reach
soldiers
were
drawn
up
in
close
formation
it
was
clear
that
this
was
no
ceremonial
parade
the
men
were
in
full
marching
order
their
were
smoking
in
the
background
they
had
the
look
of
troops
equipped
for
action
expecting
to
take
the
offensive
at
any
moment
this
much
he
saw
as
he
was
hurried
into
the
palace
before
the
great
doors
clanged
behind
him
he
found
himself
on
the
threshold
of
a
magnificence
that
he
had
not
imagined
existed
everywhere
his
eyes
rested
they
encountered
riches
accumulated
through
the
centuries
pictures
and
tapestries
gazed
down
on
him
from
the
walls
chronicling
the
glory
of
the
bygone
hapsburgs
suits
of
mail
and
stood
like
knights
of
old
leaning
on
their
swords
he
followed
his
escort
up
a
marble
staircase
along
endless
corridors
from
which
doors
opened
into
silent
apartments
giving
yet
fresh
vistas
of
royal
splendors
at
last
in
the
far
distance
the
passage
was
blocked
by
a
gigantic
figure
that
might
have
escaped
from
grand
opera
it
stood
so
stiff
and
motionless
that
he
mistook
it
for
a
it
was
garbed
as
a
halberdier
in
hose
and
shining
armor
only
when
the
eyes
moved
did
he
realize
that
he
was
gazing
at
one
of
the
when
the
password
had
been
given
they
were
allowed
to
slip
behind
a
curtain
in
the
he
was
told
to
wait
his
escort
vanished
through
the
a
moment
later
the
doors
reopened
and
his
escort
beckoned
he
was
aware
of
a
blaze
of
light
lofty
walls
tall
windows
a
tapestried
room
ornately
furnished
and
a
treacherously
polished
expanse
of
floor
a
man
was
rising
from
behind
an
ormolu
table
he
was
a
man
utterly
simple
and
modern
the
last
man
one
would
have
expected
to
find
in
the
pomp
of
medieval
surroundings
his
face
was
bluff
and
in
his
suit
he
looked
more
like
a
yachtsman
than
the
governor
of
a
state
he
was
approaching
with
his
hand
outstretched
could
do
less
than
receive
you
he
was
saying
the
words
though
spoken
pleasantly
sounded
like
a
dismissal
your
excellency
has
forgotten
the
purpose
of
my
errand
in
the
least
let
sit
down
we
can
talk
more
informally
the
trouble
is
that
you
come
too
late
crises
as
acute
as
ours
have
a
knack
of
settling
hindwood
accepted
a
cigarette
that
was
proffered
he
took
his
time
while
he
lit
it
solution
is
mustering
in
the
my
are
no
longer
needed
is
that
what
you
intend
me
to
understand
excellency
spoke
just
now
of
crises
settling
themselves
did
you
mean
that
so
many
of
your
countrymen
have
died
that
at
last
sufficient
food
to
go
round
from
it
our
shortage
is
greater
than
judged
as
hindwood
tapped
his
ash
casually
only
arrived
last
night
but
in
the
time
i
been
in
budapest
i
seen
the
the
the
utter
destitution
i
reason
to
believe
that
bolshevism
has
collapsed
and
that
millions
of
outcast
russians
are
marching
they
moving
he
paused
himself
skeptical
of
the
preposterous
assertion
he
was
about
to
make
then
he
remembered
the
words
he
had
learnt
from
captain
lajos
and
repeated
them
like
a
lesson
sweeping
westward
like
a
pestilence
they
loping
like
gaunt
wolves
they
drawing
nearer
like
death
swinging
his
scythe
poland
will
go
down
before
them
first
its
famished
people
will
join
them
your
turn
will
come
next
the
march
will
never
halt
till
the
empty
bellies
have
been
filled
they
ca
be
filled
till
the
whole
of
europe
has
been
swamped
by
revolution
unless
he
paused
again
waiting
for
encouragement
when
the
steady
gray
eyes
still
regarded
him
attentively
he
continued
i
fill
unless
said
his
excellency
like
a
man
commenting
on
the
weather
destroy
there
was
a
deep
quiet
so
varensky
had
been
a
true
prophet
it
was
the
end
of
the
world
they
were
discussing
the
end
of
truth
justice
mercy
everything
that
was
kind
across
the
silence
a
spurted
like
a
stream
of
blood
see
my
position
his
excellency
resumed
reasonably
i
buy
from
you
i
prolong
the
agony
worse
still
i
run
my
country
further
into
debt
if
i
give
the
call
to
arms
many
of
us
will
die
but
it
better
to
die
fighting
than
from
hunger
besides
in
the
of
war
who
knows
we
may
find
ourselves
arrayed
on
the
winning
hindwood
was
too
stunned
to
think
quickly
he
was
still
refusing
to
believe
the
worst
miss
your
point
would
your
excellency
mind
explaining
point
simple
enough
the
condition
of
hungary
and
of
the
whole
of
central
europe
is
due
to
two
causes
the
first
that
we
made
a
the
second
that
we
lost
it
the
victors
had
a
right
to
exact
a
penalty
but
look
at
what
they
done
we
were
exhausted
nevertheless
if
they
told
us
what
we
owed
them
we
have
paid
them
instead
of
that
they
cloaked
revenge
with
idealism
they
constituted
themselves
evangelists
to
reform
us
with
their
gospel
of
they
gave
every
racial
hostility
within
our
borders
a
voice
they
carved
us
up
into
bickering
factions
which
they
called
nations
and
bestowed
on
them
the
power
to
make
themselves
annoying
behind
new
frontiers
they
dipped
their
hands
into
our
national
resources
and
made
gifts
to
their
favorites
transylvania
was
our
granary
it
went
to
rumania
bohemia
was
our
the
czechs
have
it
hungary
is
no
longer
we
have
our
factories
but
no
fuel
to
run
them
our
skilled
workmen
but
no
means
of
employing
them
on
every
side
we
fenced
in
by
mushroom
democracies
drawing
sustenance
from
what
was
once
our
body
the
wrong
they
have
done
us
is
the
motive
of
their
hate
we
european
countries
fall
into
three
categories
the
robbers
the
receivers
of
stolen
goods
and
the
pillaged
there
no
intercourse
between
us
confidence
is
at
an
end
our
currency
has
become
worthless
as
the
paper
on
which
it
printed
there
no
flow
of
trade
we
each
have
too
much
of
one
commodity
and
none
whatsoever
of
others
too
many
factories
here
too
much
wheat
there
too
much
coal
in
another
place
we
rival
storekeepers
overstocked
in
certain
lines
who
refuse
to
take
down
our
shutters
if
we
could
forget
our
quarrels
and
club
together
we
have
all
the
means
of
life
we
deserve
our
fate
you
say
but
no
it
was
the
allies
surgeons
who
carved
us
into
impotence
and
on
top
of
that
imposed
indemnities
we
have
nothing
to
eat
so
we
prefer
to
what
do
you
gain
by
it
his
excellency

or
nothing
we
ca
be
worse
off
the
russian
menace
may
prove

be
our
salvation
the
red
terror
has
vanished
the
famine
terror
has
taken
its
place
if
the
starving
hordes
pouring
westwards
are
halted
civilization
will
be
blotted
out
by
savagery
and
who
to
halt
them
not
the
allies
their
common
people
are
rebellious
they
know
that
in
the
last
war
they
were
as
much
cheated
and
exploited
as
any
of
the
enemy
whom
they
routed
and
not
their
politicians

they
too
bloated
with

restoration

old
hindwood
spoke
eagerly
one
shall
die
we
had
enough
of
dying
i
have
a
better
solution
bread
my
should
be
arriving
tonight
or
i
wired
for
them
before
i
left
vienna
i
build
a
wall
of
bread
from
the
black
sea
to
the
who
pay
you
the
answer
had
been
totally
unexpected
his
excellency
glanced
sharply
across
his
shoulder
as
though
seeking
advice
hindwood
followed
his
direction
and
saw
to
his
amazement
that
the
tapestry
hanging
behind
the
ormolu
table
was
agitated
throughout
the
interview
an
unseen
audience
had
been
present
his
excellency
turned
back
shall
neither
give
nor
sell
i
may
admire
your
humanity
but
in
hungary
i
forbid
you
to
build
what
you
so
picturesquely
call
your
wall
of
bread
austria
as
i
know
has
already
refused
you
in
poland
you
will
receive
the
same
answer
things
have
advanced
too
far
for
there
to
be
any
harm
in
telling
you
moreover
i
owe
it
to
you
to
be
frank
i
represent
a
class
which
the
democracy
of
the
allies
has
totally
disinherited
the
class
of
the
landed
gentry
and
the
old
nobility
however
matters
might
improve
in
our
respective
countries
our
lot
would
be
in
no
way
benefited
the
peace
of
the
allies
uprooted
aristocracy
and
planted
in
its
stead
a
raw
republicanism
the
estates
of
men
like
myself
whether
austrian
polish
russian
or
hungarian
have
been
in
our
families
for
centuries
they
were
grants
from
kings
for
loyalty
and
services
now
that
our
kings
have
been
sent
into
exile
our
entire
status
is
in
jeopardy
our
rank
and
privileges
have
become
a
jest
or
the
next
day
where
it
has
not
happened
already
we
shall
join
our
kings
in
banishment
our
wealth
will
be
confiscated
the
excuse
of
a
new
war
is
the
chance
of
european
monarchists
banded
together
we
may
snatch
back
our
authority
and
set
up
the
thrones
which
the
allies
have
toppled
so
long
as
the
people
starve
they
will
follow
us
monarchy
is
the
symbol
of
their
lost
contentment
they
fight
for
it
if
we
make
its
restoration
their
but
if
once
we
were
to
allow
you
to
give
them
bread
hindwood
sprang
to
his
feet
the
time
had
come
to
play
his
would
lay
down
their
arms
he
cried
triumphantly
shall
lay
them
down
by
they
shall
be
again
the
tapestry
rustled
for
a
moment
it
seemed
that
some
one
was
about
to
disclose
himself
then
all
grew
quiet
have
given
you
your
answer
said
his
excellency
hindwood
laughed
i
can
force
your
hand
i
shall
appeal
to
the
people
over
your
without
further
ceremony
he
swung
round
on
his
heel
and
departed
on
regaining
the
hotel
he
went
in
search
of
santa
she
was
not
there
he
betook
himself
to
her
room
to
await
her
coming
one
hour
two
hours
slipped
by
he
began
to
be
anxious
in
the
appearance
of
the
room
there
was
nothing
to
distress
him
all
her
belongings
were
intact
when
he
made
inquiries
of
the
hotel
staff
they
professed
entire
ignorance
of
her
whereabouts
apart
from
the
concern
he
felt
for
her
safety
she
was
utterly
essential
to
his
plans
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
get
in
touch
with
varensky
without
varensky
and
his
four
hundred
veterans
he
was
helpless
when
his
arrived
he
would
need
them
he
made
repeated
efforts
to
rediscover
the
mildewed
barracks
every
time
he
missed
his
direction
for
fear
of
spies
he
did
not
dare
to
ask
he
remembered
santa
warning
that
to
be
seen
with
varensky
meant
death
day
faded
darkness
fell
she
had
not
returned
it
was
nearing
midnight
when
word
reached
him
that
the
first
of
his
trains
was
in
the
it
had
been
given
the
right
of
way
from
holland
and
had
been
rushed
straight
through
under
an
armed
guard
he
was
powerless
to
turn
the
information
to
account
wearied
with
anxiety
he
had
begun
to
prepare
for
bed
when
without
knocking
the
door
was
burst
open
captain
lajos
entered
his
face
was
haggard
he
was
fierce
and
breathless
heard
heard
been
whom
hindwood
clapped
his
hand
to
his
forehead
either
he
or
this
man
was
mad
impossible
rogovich
is
i
tell
you
he
at
the
palace
he
was
there
behind
the
tapestry
this
morning
she
with
him
now
and
he
torturing
why
are
you
here
if
you
care
for
her
so
much
you
may
help
me
rescue
chapter
the
eighth
the
vanishing
point
i
spurred
into
haste
by
the
captain
air
of
calamity
hindwood
had
commenced
to
dress
during
the
few
minutes
that
it
took
him
to
hurry
into
his
clothes
he
thought
furiously
with
the
result
that
by
the
time
he
was
clad
for
departure
he
seated
himself
obstinately
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
meanwhile
in
the
belief
that
he
was
being
followed
the
captain
had
led
the
way
into
the
passage
he
had
now
returned
and
stood
filling
the
doorway
a
turbulent
figure
in
his
gorgeous
uniform
of
the
royal
hussars
no
time
to
he
rapped
out
hindwood
eyed
him
calmly
you
were
sent
to
execute
me
you
can
do
it
here
as
conveniently
as
anywhere
the
sheer
amazement
which
greeted
this
accusation
seemed
to
disprove
its
accuracy
the
captain
answered
scornfully
devil
of
contrariness
has
put
that
thought
into
your
head
if
my
errand
were
known
it
would
be
i
who
would
be
executed
she
in
love
with
you
that
why
i
sought
you
it
the
fact
that
you
my
rival
in
her
affections
that
makes
you
the
one
man
in
budapest
whom
i
can
trust
there
be
bloodshed
slower
hindwood
interrupted
yourself
in
my
place
you
know
too
much
far
more
than
seems
healthy
you
know
that
this
morning
when
i
was
with
the
governor
there
was
an
unseen
listener
behind
the
tapestry
you
assert
that
he
was
a
man
whom
all
the
world
believes
to
be
dead
if
you
think
back
to
our
journey
from
calais
you
remember
that
the
reason
for
his
having
been
murdered
formed
your
chief
topic
of
conversation
seeing
that
you
know
so
much
you
probably
aware
that
my
interview
with
the
governor
ended
in
a
threat
to
make
that
threat
effective
the
cooperation
of
the
woman
whom
you
first
supposed
to
be
my
wife
and
afterwards
discovered
to
be
my
secretary
is
absolutely
necessary
on
my
return
from
the
palace
she
had
vanished
here
again
you
pretend
to
know
more
than
i
do
at
close
on
midnight
you
come
bursting
into
my
room
demanding
that
i
accompany
you
to
her
the
captain
stared
dully
second
counts
what
is
it
that
you
wish
me
to
tell
you
hung
on
my
trail
from
calais
until
his
expression
became
embarrassed
then
he
raised
his
head
with
a
fearless
gesture
see
what
you
driving
at
i
acknowledge
that
my
movements
are
open
to
misinterpretation
but
i
did
follow
you
it
was
she
whom
i
followed
as
i
told
you
in
our
first
conversation
i
was
returning
from
england
where
i
been
sent
by
my
government
to
intercept
prince
rogovich
with
important
despatches
the
moment
i
clapped
my
eyes
on
your
traveling
companion
i
recognized
in
her
a
startling
resemblance
it
was
to
a
woman
i
had
adored
she
was
far
beyond
me
the
mistress
of
archdukes
and
for
a
brief
while
of
an
emperor
the
nearest
i
ever
came
to
touching
her
was
when
i
was
swept
by
her
train
at
court
he
paused
dramatically
the
war
she
was
shot
by
the
enemies
of
my
country
infamous
things
were
said
of
her
if
they
were
true
they
would
make
no
difference
to
my
love
no
difference
do
you
understand
again
he
paused
else
hindwood
narrowed
his
eyes
time
i
met
you
you
harped
on
the
same
theme
prince
rogovich
up
to
now
i
not
thought
it
necessary
to
tell
you
i
knew
this
prince
rogovich
besides
myself
there
was
probably
only
one
other
person
who
spoke
with
him
before
his
end
what
makes
you
so
certain
that
it
was
a
man
presumed
to
have
been
drowned
in
the
english
channel
who
spied
on
me
this
morning
from
behind
the
tapestry
was
beside
him
i
his
bodyguard
if
you
like
his
secretary
just
come
from
him
can
you
have
stronger
proof
than
that
suddenly
the
captain
patience
broke
down
many
more
questions
god
knows
what
hindwood
had
risen
are
several
why
did
he
disappear
has
not
makes
you
require
my
help
to
rescue
her
may
kill
me
it
not
likely
he
kill
both
of
his
motive
hindwood
spoke
more
slowly
all
his
suspicion
was
emphasized
in
his
words
his
motive
for
kidnaping
this
woman
who
resembles
can
i
tell
the
captain
was
desperate
talk
and
talk
while
time
passes
i
suppose
his
interest
is
the
same
in
this
woman
as
in
all
women
perhaps
he
was
the
discarded
lover
of
that
other
woman
and
like
myself
has
noticed
the
hindwood
picked
up
his
hat
you
armed
in
your
sense
i
shall
fight
with
a
different
sort
of
ii
at
the
door
a
closed
vehicle
was
standing
to
hindwood
it
seemed
the
one
that
had
flashed
by
him
on
the
previous
evening
he
glanced
between
the
wheels
there
was
no
russian
even
before
he
was
seated
the
lash
had
been
laid
across
the
horses
backs
the
next
moment
they
were
galloping
down
the
gloomy
street
leaning
from
the
window
the
captain
was
urging
the
coachman
to
drive
faster
when
the
pace
had
settled
to
a
rapid
trot
broke
the
silence
an
hungarian
officer
prince
rogovich
is
a
polish
statesman
you
tell
me
you
his
secretary
what
a
polish
statesman
doing
in
the
royal
palace
directing
hungary
affairs
is
hungary
affairs
that
he
directing
it
the
campaign
against
democracy
the
present
crisis
has
made
budapest
the
point
for
the
offensive
which
the
monarchists
have
been
waiting
to
launch
the
monarchists
are
men
of
every
country
who
have
sunk
their
nationalities
and
made
a
common
you
are
you
a
monarchist
his
reply
came
muffled
was
i
a
the
horses
thrown
sharply
back
on
their
haunches
swerved
toward
the
pavement
the
carriage
jerked
to
a
halt
almost
brushing
the
wheels
in
the
narrow
street
a
column
of
soldiers
shuffled
past
their
rifles
were
slung
at
all
angles
their
shoulders
were
bowed
beneath
their
heavy
packs
they
crawled
weakly
more
like
stragglers
retreating
than
advancing
even
in
the
darkness
their
bones
showed
pointed
and
their
faces
lean
with
famine
the
captain
explained
shortly
has
hindwood
strained
through
the
gloom
touching
his
arm
excitedly
men
being
sent
to
kill
men
who
are
more
starving
spoken
of
a
woman
you
adored
a
woman
who
was
shot
for
hideous
treacheries
her
treacheries
were
committed
to
prevent
just
such
crimes
as
that
do
interrupt
me
not
yet
you
expected
me
to
believe
an
impossible
story
that
a
man
can
return
from
the
dead
if
i
were
to
tell
you
an
equally
improbable
story
what
difference
would
it
make
to
your
love
if
i
were
to
tell
you
that
the
resemblance
was
not
mistaken
and
that
the
woman
at
the
palace
is
the
same
as
she
who
was
reported
executed
in
the
woods
of
vincennes
the
last
of
the
column
had
slouched
into
the
blackness
the
horses
leapt
forward
impatiently
the
question
was
repeated
difference
the
captain
voice
burst
from
him
forgive
me
neither
of
them
dared
to
trust
the
other
their
respite
was
growing
shorter
they
had
crossed
the
bridge
above
the
danube
in
a
moment
the
ascent
to
the
palace
would
commence
it
was
hindwood
who
decided
on
boldness
if
he
were
walking
into
an
ambush
he
could
not
make
matters
worse
he
said
will
be
useless
only
to
kill
the
prince
wo
save
her
if
we
manage
to
escape
from
the
palace
the
streets
are
full
of
armed
men
we
should
only
rescue
her
to
die
with
her
i
have
a
plan
do
you
know
the
barracks
of
the
russian
refugees
if
i
were
to
write
a
note
would
you
guarantee
to
have
it
delivered
by
the
light
of
matches
held
by
the
captain
he
scrawled
rapidly
the
last
sentence
read
you
have
not
heard
from
me
again
by
consider
that
the
worst
has
happened
and
carry
out
these
he
addressed
the
note
to
husband
of
it
entrusted
to
a
man
who
can
not
read
the
captain
extinguished
the
final
match
shall
send
it
by
the
driver
of
this
iii
they
had
alighted
some
distance
short
of
the
gateway
where
the
sentries
would
be
on
guard
the
message
for
varensky
had
been
handed
over
the
horses
had
been
wheeled
about
save
for
their
trotting
growing
fainter
down
the
slope
the
night
was
without
a
sound
the
moon
shone
fitfully
stars
were
obscured
the
city
out
of
which
they
had
climbed
lay
pulseless
in
an
unillumined
pit
of
blackness
the
palace
piled
high
above
them
loomed
sepulchral
the
captain
groped
his
way
beneath
the
wall
of
the
ramparts
searching
for
something
which
at
last
he
found
it
pushed
inwards
at
his
touch
the
door
closed
behind
them
in
the
intenser
darkness
hindwood
stretched
out
his
hands
they
encountered
the
rough
surface
of
clammy
masonry
he
was
in
some
sort
of
a
tunnel
the
floor
sloped
gradually
upwards
the
atmosphere
smelt
dank
he
spoke
getting
no
answer
he
held
his
breath
going
away
from
him
he
heard
the
stealthy
hurrying
of
the
captain
footfall
rather
than
be
left
perhaps
to
be
forgotten
he
started
forward
at
a
blundering
run
he
came
to
steps
he
was
prepared
to
be
attacked
it
might
be
here
that
he
would
be
hurled
back
he
climbed
them
almost
on
all
fours
steadying
himself
with
his
hands
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
ascending
for
hours
when
he
heard
footsteps
returning
a
match
was
struck
he
saw
the
captain
staring
down
at
him
in
the
match
went
out
hold
of
me
tread
they
passed
through
another
door
the
air
was
growing
warmer
it
was
evident
that
they
were
traversing
a
secret
passage
which
wound
within
the
palace
walls
at
a
turn
they
heard
a
muttering
of
voices
the
captain
whispered
nothing
till
i
give
the
they
approached
more
cautiously
to
where
a
needle
of
light
stabbed
the
darkness
hindwood
caught
the
fragrance
of
tobacco
smoke
as
he
stooped
to
the
a
purring
voice
commenced
speaking
almost
at
his
elbow
dear
lady
you
mine
a
fact
which
you
do
seem
to
realize
i
have
only
to
press
this
button
which
summons
my
attendants
i
can
snuff
out
your
life
with
as
little
effort
as
i
flick
this
he
found
himself
peering
into
a
room
furnished
with
oriental
lavishness
he
had
a
confused
glimpse
of
beaten
shaded
lamps
low
tables
cushions
piled
about
in
place
of
chairs
it
was
a
blaze
of
color
at
the
far
end
was
a
gilded
throne
and
bound
to
it
was
santa
her
hands
were
tightly
corded
her
ankles
were
lashed
so
that
she
could
not
stir
her
face
was
pale
as
ivory
only
her
eyes
seemed
alive
they
flashed
indomitably
pacing
up
and
down
never
shifting
his
gaze
from
hers
was
the
man
who
had
disappeared
from
the
she
spoke
defiantly
your
attendants
do
you
think
i
fear
death
know
you
do
dear
lady
that
why
i
invented
a
more
subtle
revenge
if
i
were
an
ordinary
man
i
should
detest
the
very
sight
of
you
whereas
so
magnanimous
am
i
that
your
attempt
to
murder
me
has
added
a
novel
piquancy
to
your
fascination
i
have
been
too
much
loved
too
spontaneously
too
adoringly
you
afford
me
a
contrast
i
intend
to
keep
you
caged
like
a
lioness
the
hatred
in
your
eyes
will
spur
my
affection
always
even
when
i
caress
you
i
shall
have
to
be
on
my
guard
our
courtship
will
be
a
perpetual
adventure
the
goal
of
desire
will
be
forever
out
of
grasp
yet
forever
within
he
stroked
his
black
beard
thoughtfully
you
i
shall
never
know
satiety
this
continual
hoping
will
keep
me
young
you
my
dear
will
be
my
secret
source
of
romance
every
day
i
shall
take
you
down
as
one
takes
down
a
volume
and
turn
your
latest
pages
which
i
alone
may
she
strained
at
her
bonds
will
be
no
he
smiled
with
terrifying
quietness
value
to
me
he
continued
in
his
purring
voice
that
cost
me
so
much
ugh
every
time
i
look
at
you
i
remember
how
it
felt
when
i
sank
and
sank
when
i
rose
above
the
waves
i
saw
your
lights
streaking
like
a
golden
snake
into
the
blackness
i
struck
out
after
you
hopelessly
i
shouted
then
i
found
myself
alone
with
no
one
to
take
pity
on
me
and
not
one
chance
in
a
million
of
being
rescued
the
millionth
chance
he
stooped
at
her
feet
kissing
her
tortured
hands
here
we
are
met
under
these
auspicious
circumstances
carrying
on
this
pleasant
conversation
what
were
you
doing
while
i
was
drowning
making
love
beneath
the
stars
to
your
infatuated
american
leaning
on
his
arm
perhaps
warmly
wrapped
in
your
sables
and
i
was
so
cold
did
you
give
me
a
thought
i
wonder
she
stared
past
him
like
a
woman
frozen
me
know
the
tapping
her
cheek
with
pretended
kindness
he
resumed
his
pacing
the
worst
is
that
flattering
when
i
spoken
of
our
courtship
we
well
matched
in
wickedness
if
in
nothing
else
you
wanted
for
the
scaffold
whereas
i
should
have
been
hung
long
ago
if
i
received
my
deserts
i
be
interested
to
know
what
you
do
if
you
were
in
my
place
how
much
mercy
would
you
show
me
you
must
own
that
merely
to
kill
a
person
who
has
tried
to
drown
you
is
too
brief
a
punishment
the
punishment
i
planned
for
you
is
one
that
make
you
pray
every
hour
for
extinction
for
a
woman
who
has
dispensed
annihilation
so
lavishly
i
can
think
of
nothing
more
just
than
that
when
her
own
life
has
become
intolerable
she
should
be
refused
the
boon
of
she
spoke
humbly
nothing
too
bad
that
you
can
do
to
me
but
i
not
the
woman
who
tried
to
murder
you
i
changed
i
learnt
something
i
learnt
it
from
a
he
bowed
towards
her
mockingly
american
american
who
can
never
be
mine
i
learnt
that
even
when
we
acknowledge
him
there
a
god
in
the
world
who
acts
through
us
it
was
he
who
saved
me
from
the
woods
of
vincennes
it
was
he
who
prevented
you
from
drowning
he
had
some
purpose
a
divine
moment
for
which
he
waited
that
purpose
has
yet
to
be
accomplished
who
are
you
or
i
can
tell
you
who
you
are
he
snapped
with
a
price
upon
your
head
as
for
myself
his
pale
face
flooded
with
a
strangely
satanic
beauty
would
puzzle
the
wisest
man
to
say
who
i
am
i
am
prince
rogovich
tomorrow
i
may
be
emperor
my
puppets
are
mustering
by
dawn
they
be
marching
they
hungry
victory
to
them
means
if
one
were
to
feed
them
american
again
he
gazed
down
on
her
showing
his
white
teeth
and
laughing
faith
you
have
in
the
man
if
your
american
is
unaccomplished
purpose
then
god
and
all
his
angels
are
thwarted
the
messenger
i
have
sent
to
execute
him
will
not
fail
he
has
good
reason
to
hate
him
he
his
rival
for
your
affections
you
were
the
bribe
i
offered
him
you
may
rest
assured
the
captain
work
will
be
done
well
his
turn
comes
jerking
back
her
head
he
stooped
lower
drinking
in
her
despair
chances
come
once
if
then
yours
came
at
vincennes
cease
hoping
your
american
is
a
hindwood
felt
himself
flung
violently
back
the
wall
turned
inwards
there
was
a
report
then
silence
iv
the
prince
had
pitched
forward
with
his
head
in
santa
lap
his
hands
were
clawing
at
her
gown
as
he
struggled
he
stiffened
and
slid
back
till
he
lay
across
her
feet
grinning
up
at
her
the
captain
his
revolver
still
smoking
in
his
hand
threw
himself
to
his
knees
feeling
for
his
victim
heart
he
spoke
dully
dream
of
monarchy
is
the
quietness
was
broken
by
a
distant
clamor
momentarily
it
gathered
volume
and
drew
nearer
throughout
the
palace
which
had
seemed
so
wrapt
in
sleep
feet
were
running
from
the
rose
the
clatter
of
arms
and
the
impatience
of
orders
being
shouted
on
the
door
of
the
chamber
an
importunate
tapping
had
commenced
hindwood
looked
up
in
the
midst
of
freeing
santa
beat
in
the
panels
find
out
what
they
the
captain
dragged
himself
to
the
door
which
he
did
not
dare
to
open
a
rapid
exchange
of
hungarian
followed
as
santa
tottered
to
her
feet
with
the
last
cord
severed
the
captain
tiptoed
back
by
the
passage
the
shot
was
heard
they
insist
on
seeing
prince
be
butchered
in
the
streets
i
guess
hindwood
shook
his
head
does
not
lie
in
that
direction
they
shall
see
in
ten
minutes
at
the
window
tell
the
captain
stood
aghast
pointing
down
at
the
glazing
eyes
of
the
man
he
had
murdered
say
they
the
answer
was
delivered
the
tapping
ceased
abruptly
on
to
your
hindwood
crouched
above
the
body
dragging
it
into
a
sitting
posture
exactly
ten
minutes
to
make
it
look
like
a
man
who
hopes
to
become
an
emperor
the
peace
of
the
world
may
depend
on
he
turned
to
the
captain
who
were
his
bodyguard
how
would
he
have
dressed
if
his
ambition
had
been
granted
too
pale
for
speech
the
captain
moved
towards
a
chest
with
trembling
hands
he
drew
forth
a
purple
robe
and
with
mythical
beasts
of
heraldry
dipping
deeper
he
laid
beside
it
a
scepter
and
an
iron
crown
of
twisted
laurels
hindwood
smiled
grimly
the
scene
had
been
rehearsed
how
do
these
things
go
you
must
help
me
put
them
on
when
the
prince
had
been
arrayed
the
throne
he
ordered
take
the
three
of
us
to
move
the
gilded
throne
had
been
hauled
from
its
alcove
so
as
to
face
the
window
the
dead
man
in
the
tinsel
of
his
dreams
had
been
seated
on
it
he
was
bound
to
prevent
him
from
lolling
bound
with
the
cords
with
which
he
himself
had
secured
santa
his
robe
was
spread
about
him
across
his
knees
with
his
right
hand
resting
on
it
was
the
scepter
on
his
head
was
the
iron
crown
of
laurels
lamps
place
them
at
his
feet
switch
on
all
the
lights
then
the
curtains
were
flung
back
a
dazzling
shaft
pierced
the
outer
darkness
there
was
a
breathless
silence
as
of
worship
a
superstitious
rustling
a
deafening
acclamation
which
echoed
and
roared
about
the
illustration
it
continued
unabated
for
a
full
five
minutes
it
sagged
and
sank
again
it
mounted
then
it
paused
expectant
it
was
for
all
the
world
like
a
triumph
at
the
opera
when
a
singer
only
bows
and
an
encore
is
demanded
it
recommenced
this
time
there
was
a
note
of
anger
the
dead
man
grinned
down
at
the
applauding
mob
he
gave
no
sign
to
these
men
prepared
to
die
for
him
slowly
it
seemed
to
dawn
on
them
that
he
did
not
care
that
he
had
never
cared
for
their
wounds
and
hunger
that
for
men
of
his
sort
they
were
only
beasts
that
it
made
no
difference
whether
they
were
conquered
or
victorious
he
would
sit
there
as
all
the
kings
and
emperors
before
him
secure
and
immobile
sneering
at
their
sacrifices
and
coining
their
sufferings
into
profit
they
found
contempt
in
his
vacant
stare
cruelty
in
his
marble
hands
that
clutched
the
scepter
gesticulating
and
cursing
they
hurled
reproaches
at
him
they
trampled
the
officers
who
tried
to
quell
them
shots
were
exchanged
pandemonium
was
commencing
hindwood
consulted
his
watch
it
lacked
but
a
few
minutes
till
two
if
he
could
hold
the
garrison
in
confusion
varensky
would
have
time
to
seize
his
chance
he
turned
to
the
captain
behind
the
curtain
where
they
watched
is
it
they
want
was
some
acknowledgment
at
first
then
a
speech
now
it
bread
ca
you
hear
them
bread
or
we
do
not
march
at
that
moment
the
hammering
on
the
outer
door
hindwood
seized
the
captain
arm
must
speak
to
them
they
understand
me
you
in
uniform
there
santa
if
you
do
all
is
shall
i
tell
them
speak
to
them
as
the
mouthpiece
of
prince
rogovich
say
there
food
in
the
two
of
it
and
more
arriving
that
soon
the
warehouses
of
budapest
will
be
the
captain
stepped
forward
an
heroic
figure
just
as
he
appeared
in
the
oblong
of
the
window
whether
it
was
the
sight
of
his
uniform
that
provoked
the
storm
was
not
certain
a
volley
of
bullets
shattered
the
glass
he
clapped
his
hand
to
his
forehead
there
was
a
second
volley
the
room
was
plunged
in
darkness
hindwood
darted
forward
the
pounding
on
the
grew
frantic
in
the
there
was
the
silence
of
horror
released
by
the
knife
of
flying
lead
the
body
of
the
prince
had
doubled
forward
as
though
to
peer
down
at
the
man
who
had
betrayed
him
the
captain
was
beyond
all
help
as
hindwood
leapt
back
in
search
of
santa
the
door
went
down
with
a
crash
in
a
second
the
darkness
was
filled
to
overflowing
halberdiers
palace
servants
officials
in
the
confusion
he
caught
her
hand
and
escaped
unnoticed
through
the
pressing
throng
as
they
hurried
through
salons
hung
with
priceless
treasures
looting
had
started
the
first
of
the
mob
were
ruthlessly
at
work
at
the
foot
of
the
marble
staircase
he
glanced
at
his
watch
exactly
two
he
murmured
v
they
had
passed
beneath
the
gateway
where
sentries
should
have
challenged
their
posts
were
deserted
as
they
struck
the
road
descending
beneath
the
ramparts
santa
questioned
did
you
say
exactly
two
of
a
note
i
sent
he
changed
the
subject
were
you
captured
she
hesitated
was
after
we
quarreled
i
was
afraid
i
lost
you
a
messenger
arrived
saying
you
were
with
the
governor
and
wanted
me
it
was
a
lie
the
person
who
wanted
me
was
prince
lajos
betrayed
you
he
knew
nothing
of
what
happened
on
the
he
was
infatuated
with
me
and
must
have
she
clutched
his
arm
putting
me
off
you
said
so
strangely
exactly
two
what
was
in
your
note
to
varensky
for
answer
he
halted
and
pointed
far
below
in
the
gulf
of
blackness
where
a
moment
ago
there
had
seemed
to
be
nothing
life
had
begun
to
quicken
in
the
flash
of
multitudinous
a
city
was
being
born
it
kindled
in
vivid
strokes
like
veins
of
fire
etched
on
the
pavement
of
the
night
as
though
an
artist
were
completing
his
design
ten
thousand
windows
opened
their
eyes
filling
in
blank
spaces
with
rapid
specks
of
gold
seen
from
such
a
height
the
effect
was
in
miniature
the
very
sounds
which
rose
up
were
little
at
first
they
were
no
more
than
a
sustained
humming
as
when
a
hive
is
about
to
swarm
they
swelled
to
a
melodious
muttering
then
with
a
rush
of
ecstasy
the
storm
of
joy
broke
the
air
pulsated
with
the
maddening
clash
of
chimes
she
was
clinging
to
him
is
it
is
it
the
thing
for
which
hoped
he
glanced
back
across
his
shoulder
at
the
huge
pile
towering
on
the
rock
above
him
those
madmen
up
there
destroying
and
pillaging
had
they
time
to
hear
it
the
palace
was
glowing
like
a
furnace
as
he
watched
a
column
of
flame
shot
tall
towards
the
sky
seizing
her
hand
he
broke
into
a
run
making
all
the
haste
he
could
down
the
steep
decline
behind
them
the
flames
crept
like
serpents
licking
the
clouds
and
mounting
higher
the
heat
was
like
the
breath
of
a
pursuer
night
had
become
vivid
as
day
there
was
no
concealment
the
crest
of
the
ramparts
was
a
gigantic
torch
the
danube
far
below
was
stained
red
as
wine
their
very
shadows
were
lurid
and
still
the
bells
across
the
river
pealed
out
their
joy
there
was
a
galloping
riderless
horses
broken
loose
from
the
stables
thundered
by
then
an
automobile
driven
by
a
man
with
a
seared
and
wounded
face
others
followed
the
crowd
on
foot
fleeing
from
its
handiwork
was
not
far
behind
as
an
empty
car
with
an
officer
at
the
wheel
slowed
down
at
a
hairpin
bend
santa
and
he
leapt
aboard
the
danger
was
outdistanced
they
had
crossed
the
danube
they
were
scarcely
likely
now
to
be
implicated
in
what
had
happened
to
prince
but
they
were
still
at
the
mercy
of
their
reckless
driver
in
his
panic
he
had
not
once
looked
around
he
was
unaware
that
he
carried
passengers
hindwood
knew
very
clearly
where
he
wanted
to
go
it
was
probably
the
last
place
to
which
he
would
be
taken
the
streets
of
pest
near
the
river
were
solitary
but
somewhere
the
mob
was
gathering
it
might
prove
awkward
to
be
found
in
the
company
of
a
uniformed
monarchist
who
was
escaping
having
formulated
his
plan
he
whispered
it
to
santa
i
tackle
him
you
grasp
the
leaning
forward
he
flung
his
arm
about
the
man
neck
jerking
him
backwards
the
car
swerved
and
mounted
the
pavement
santa
turned
it
into
the
road
again
taken
by
surprise
the
man
offered
small
resistance
the
struggle
was
short
hindwood
toppled
him
out
climbed
into
the
front
seat
and
took
his
place
station
where
is
it
he
asked
breathlessly
she
glanced
at
him
with
a
revival
of
her
old
suspicion
not
leaving
why
the
station
he
could
have
laughed
the
old
distrustful
santa
little
fool
the
the
first
streets
which
they
traversed
were
deserted
yet
lamps
were
lighted
and
the
air
was
clamorous
with
as
they
drew
further
into
the
city
they
shot
past
groups
and
isolated
individuals
crawling
in
the
same
direction
for
the
most
part
they
were
the
kind
of
persons
santa
had
offered
to
show
him
that
morning
people
in
rags
or
entirely
stark
who
hobbled
from
weakness
or
dragged
themselves
on
all
fours
like
dogs
it
was
as
though
the
dead
were
rising
from
their
graves
to
follow
the
pied
piper
of
the
resurrection
they
came
to
a
square
where
soldiers
had
been
concentrated
their
packs
and
rifles
littered
the
open
space
the
soldiers
themselves
had
vanished
the
traffic
grew
dense
it
was
all
on
foot
turned
to
santa
shall
make
better
time
if
we
leave
the
as
they
mingled
with
the
crowd
he
had
a
nightmare
sensation
of
unreality
he
had
never
rubbed
shoulders
with
so
many
human
beings
so
nearly
naked
they
themselves
seemed
to
regard
their
conditions
as
normal
it
was
he
who
was
odd
their
legs
were
mere
poles
their
arms
laths
their
heads
were
misshapen
like
deflated
footballs
with
panting
persistence
they
padded
forward
too
frail
to
be
anything
but
orderly
the
air
was
full
of
an
earthy
fragrance
their
bodies
were
clammy
to
the
touch
he
could
push
them
aside
like
shadows
the
hair
was
brittle
as
withered
moss
it
was
the
fashionable
quarter
of
budapest
great
shone
down
on
this
flowing
river
of
gray
flesh
behind
windows
luxuries
were
displayed
for
the
temptation
of
the
foreigner
feathers
and
furs
jewels
and
laces
past
them
with
eyes
enfevered
by
starvation
stole
the
noiseless
populace
there
was
a
woman
whose
sole
clothing
was
a
rag
about
her
neck
she
continued
to
live
in
hindwood
imagination
long
after
the
sight
of
her
was
gone
and
still
with
thunderous
merriment
the
bells
above
the
city
pealed
on
at
a
turn
they
came
to
the
station
further
progress
was
blocked
exerting
his
strength
against
the
weakness
of
the
mob
hindwood
edged
his
way
forward
when
he
could
go
no
farther
he
swung
round
on
santa
them
that
i
own
the
and
that
i
going
to
get
them
she
had
no
sooner
uttered
her
translation
than
a
lane
was
cleared
as
he
passed
he
was
aware
that
parched
lips
stooped
to
kiss
his
hands
his
garments
the
very
ground
that
he
trod
he
shuddered
the
indecent
of
such
necessity
inflamed
his
indignation
ahead
a
cordon
was
drawn
across
the
road
it
was
composed
of
russian
refugees
he
recognized
them
by
their
baggy
blouses
and
by
the
women
of
the
battalions
of
death
from
the
tail
of
a
wagon
an
orator
was
speechifying
his
head
was
peaked
like
a
dunce
cap
beside
him
stood
a
woman
white
as
a
lily
with
hair
the
color
of
raw
gold
hindwood
caught
santa
arm
heaven
sake
what
he
saying
he
always
says
on
such
occasions
he
preaching
his
gospel
of
and
promising
to
die
for
cares
for
whom
he
dies
when
bellies
are
empty
and
bodies
are
naked
tell
them
i
clothe
them
and
give
them
as
she
translated
what
he
had
said
a
cry
went
up
which
drowned
varensky
he
found
himself
in
the
open
space
clambering
up
to
the
wagon
and
dragging
santa
up
beside
him
there
was
a
deep
silence
them
he
commanded
starvation
is
ended
i
feed
them
on
one
condition
that
they
refuse
to
fight
tell
them
i
drive
the
russian
menace
back
without
a
single
shot
being
fired
tell
them
that
i
promise
on
my
honor
as
an
american
to
feed
them
all
though
are
exhausted
more
will
arrive
more
and
he
paused
blinded
with
emotion
at
sight
of
the
forest
of
thin
hands
strained
up
to
him
shooting
out
his
fist
tremendously
he
threatened
tell
them
that
i
wo
feed
a
jack
one
of
them
if
there
another
man
woman
or
child
slaughtered
or
a
hint
of
vi
he
had
kept
his
word
as
far
as
hungary
was
concerned
every
living
soul
had
been
nourished
for
seven
days
and
nights
sleeping
only
at
odd
intervals
he
had
sat
in
the
barracks
of
the
russian
refugees
with
the
map
of
europe
staring
down
on
him
from
the
wall
wherever
a
had
been
despatched
the
place
had
been
marked
by
a
little
red
flag
he
had
had
a
installed
from
that
bare
room
heavy
with
mildew
he
had
sent
out
his
calls
to
humanity
he
had
begged
threatened
argued
commanded
until
at
last
he
knew
that
he
had
won
his
cause
what
he
did
not
know
was
that
his
own
example
had
proved
more
convincing
than
many
words
the
simple
drama
of
his
personal
conversion
that
he
should
be
giving
what
he
had
come
to
sell
had
stirred
men
consciences
it
had
given
him
the
right
to
talk
where
once
troops
would
have
been
hurried
food
was
being
pushed
forward
it
was
an
experiment
alarmingly
novel
but
his
phrase
caught
on
barricade
of
it
had
been
flashed
across
five
continents
wherever
the
printed
word
had
power
it
had
kindled
men
imaginations
by
a
world
confronted
by
yet
another
war
it
had
been
hailed
as
the
strategy
that
would
end
all
wars
loaf
by
loaf
sack
by
sack
the
barricade
was
rising
those
little
red
flags
pinned
on
the
map
marked
its
progress
it
was
deepening
and
spreading
in
a
flanking
movement
just
as
formerly
army
corps
had
massed
for
offensives
soon
the
barricade
would
be
complete
it
would
stretch
in
an
unbroken
line
from
the
dardanelles
to
the
baltic
there
would
be
fighting
probably
to
the
east
of
poland
where
the
monarchists
were
marching
in
a
forlorn
attempt
to
defeat
the
famished
hordes
that
could
not
be
prevented
but
by
the
time
the
outcasts
struck
his
main
defense
he
would
be
in
a
position
to
halt
them
it
was
only
now
when
the
situation
was
in
hand
that
he
had
leisure
to
realize
what
he
had
been
doing
he
was
filled
with
depression
in
his
hour
of
triumph
it
was
long
past
midnight
he
felt
gray
and
spent
the
barracks
were
as
quiet
as
a
morgue
he
wondered
why
they
had
been
so
crowded
with
derelicts
of
valiant
armies
men
and
girls
who
having
failed
to
save
russia
with
the
rifle
had
been
preparing
to
rescue
her
with
knowledge
then
he
recalled
he
had
sent
them
all
away
they
had
been
the
new
kind
of
soldier
by
whose
sacrifice
his
ideal
had
conquered
he
saw
again
their
uplifted
faces
as
he
had
summoned
them
one
by
one
and
ordered
them
on
their
perilous
journeys
wherever
a
red
flag
was
pinned
on
the
map
one
of
those
derelicts
was
in
command
the
grandmother
she
had
been
the
last
beside
himself
and
his
wireless
operators
there
could
be
no
one
left
except
varensky
santa
and
anna
he
glanced
at
the
window
it
was
a
square
of
jet
during
the
early
days
and
nights
it
had
framed
a
heart
of
fire
where
the
palace
had
smouldered
on
the
heights
of
buda
like
a
subsided
volcano
the
palace
had
burned
itself
out
it
was
as
though
the
fury
of
his
life
were
ended
he
bowed
his
head
in
his
arms
striving
to
reconjure
what
had
happened
flitting
about
the
room
with
his
strangely
catlike
tread
varensky
had
been
forever
entering
and
exiting
he
had
been
his
second
self
silent
and
agile
anticipating
his
plans
without
a
word
spoken
it
was
varensky
who
had
marshaled
his
exiled
compatriots
and
placed
their
services
at
his
disposal
it
was
varensky
who
had
warned
him
of
the
strategic
points
where
the
barricade
must
be
strengthened
it
had
been
always
varensky
to
whom
he
had
turned
for
advice
and
courage
when
things
were
darkest
without
varensky
he
could
have
accomplished
nothing
and
yet
it
was
varensky
whom
he
had
dethroned
this
should
have
been
his
moment
he
had
shouted
him
down
snatched
control
from
him
and
earned
the
credit
the
of
one
whom
he
had
despised
as
an
egoist
made
him
humble
in
a
rush
of
tenderness
he
discovered
that
he
loved
him
the
peaked
head
was
forgotten
and
the
face
scared
white
as
if
it
had
seen
a
ghost
the
timidity
of
his
appearance
no
longer
counted
the
thing
that
mattered
was
the
spirit
resolute
and
shining
as
a
sword
that
hid
within
the
scabbard
of
the
grotesque
body
and
now
that
he
remembered
there
had
been
grief
in
his
green
eyes
the
grief
of
a
man
who
had
been
cheated
once
again
varensky
had
drawn
him
near
to
calvary
the
chance
to
die
had
been
stolen
from
him
and
anna
he
could
not
guess
how
she
felt
or
what
she
thought
in
all
those
seven
days
and
nights
it
seemed
as
though
she
had
never
looked
at
him
she
had
moved
about
him
like
a
nun
ministering
to
his
wants
with
her
gaze
averted
vaguely
he
was
aware
that
to
him
she
was
not
what
she
appeared
to
others
the
old
legend
had
been
revived
again
as
in
petersburg
after
the
fall
of
czardom
wherever
she
passed
people
knelt
to
him
she
was
no
saint
his
desire
was
too
human
watching
the
three
of
them
with
sphinxlike
wisdom
there
had
been
santa
her
womanhood
clamorous
and
ignored
what
had
she
made
of
it
had
she
found
material
for
humor
in
their
temporary
heroism
and
so
he
came
back
to
his
first
question
what
had
he
been
doing
in
constructing
the
barricade
of
bread
he
had
been
preventing
varensky
from
dying
in
preventing
varensky
from
dying
he
had
been
raising
a
barricade
between
himself
and
anna
having
bankrupted
his
pocket
he
had
bankrupted
his
heart
in
spite
of
warnings
he
had
gone
in
search
of
the
vanishing
point
where
the
parallel
rails
of
possibility
and
desire
seem
to
join
the
point
at
which
to
quote
varensky
words
safety
of
the
journey
it
was
the
goal
of
every
man
who
wrecks
himself
in
the
hope
that
he
may
save
a
world
how
long
had
he
been
sitting
there
brooding
he
was
cold
the
square
of
window
had
turned
from
jet
to
gray
furtively
he
glanced
behind
him
anna
was
gazing
down
on
him
vii
she
was
dressed
for
a
journey
muffled
in
furs
her
left
hand
was
gloved
her
right
extended
his
heart
turned
coward
surely
he
had
earned
his
reward
he
commenced
to
rise
pushing
back
his
chair
the
steady
blueness
of
her
eyes
held
him
she
said
should
have
left
without
saying
if
i
had
not
known
i
could
trust
you
can
trust
me
it
because
you
can
trust
me
that
you
must
ca
not
made
a
bargain
do
you
remember
that
until
we
were
free
we
would
play
the
game
by
him
that
we
would
even
guard
him
against
himself
you
told
me
once
would
be
friends
with
a
woman
who
could
be
loyal
i
trying
to
be
she
caught
her
breath
she
nodded
die
for
in
the
silence
that
followed
the
heat
of
his
temptation
vanished
he
felt
accused
by
the
quixotic
magnanimity
of
this
strange
creature
half
prophet
half
charlatan
whose
wife
he
had
coveted
i
have
been
glad
that
he
should
die
he
confessed
slowly
not
now
food
has
done
far
more
than
his
sacrifice
could
have
accomplished
why
should
he
be
determined
to
die
now
she
trusted
herself
to
come
closer
standing
over
him
and
giving
him
her
hand
for
our
sakes
perhaps
for
his
own
perhaps
in
the
hope
that
his
appearance
may
put
a
stop
to
what
left
of
the
fighting
there
was
a
wireless
last
night
which
he
kept
to
himself
it
said
that
skirmishing
was
developing
between
the
poles
and
the
russian
refugees
in
the
no
man
land
beyond
kovel
it
was
after
he
had
read
it
that
he
went
out
i
waited
for
him
to
return
when
i
guessed
we
all
misjudged
him
perhaps
we
still
misjudging
him
who
can
say
why
he
gone
nothing
gained
by
attributing
motives
he
wants
to
give
his
life
promised
he
would
so
often
always
he
been
thwarted
he
owes
it
to
his
honor
kovel
may
be
the
world
last
battle
his
final
in
the
bare
room
the
dawn
was
spreading
rose
from
his
chair
stretching
his
cramped
body
and
gazing
at
the
map
with
its
safe
red
line
of
flags
work
is
ended
he
said
quietly
the
next
few
hours
stronger
men
will
be
here
to
take
control
a
commission
of
the
best
brains
picked
from
all
the
nations
god
chose
us
to
be
his
he
paused
having
been
his
instruments
in
averting
a
to
speak
of
things
personal
seems
paltry
and
yet
my
love
for
you
fills
all
my
thoughts
i
leave
budapest
a
bankrupt
i
shall
have
to
start
life
afresh
your
love
is
literally
my
sole
possession
and
i
have
no
right
to
she
was
backing
towards
the
door
retreating
from
him
he
stepped
over
to
the
window
widening
the
distance
that
separated
them
you
feel
more
secure
now
you
need
fear
me
he
reproached
her
it
because
i
spoke
of
our
love
we
have
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
it
we
played
fair
how
could
we
do
less
when
varensky
has
played
so
fair
by
us
it
for
our
sakes
he
gone
that
he
may
free
then
setting
out
alone
on
a
journey
would
you
mind
telling
me
its
object
know
to
prevent
him
to
catch
up
with
him
to
bring
him
if
he
refuses
die
with
he
smiled
whimsically
vanishing
point
for
you
with
your
high
standard
of
honor
if
you
were
to
overtake
it
your
problem
would
be
solved
but
suppose
the
vanishing
point
eludes
you
suppose
your
husband
agrees
to
live
have
you
thought
of
that
it
means
that
you
and
i
will
never
with
an
imploring
gesture
she
cut
him
short
means
that
you
and
i
will
never
learn
to
despise
each
other
it
means
that
i
shall
always
remember
you
at
your
greatest
as
i
seen
you
in
the
last
seven
days
brave
and
noble
so
that
you
could
even
forget
the
woman
you
he
sank
his
head
in
the
gray
square
of
window
he
looked
old
and
haggard
true
and
yet
it
incredible
if
we
were
to
allow
him
to
die
we
should
despise
each
other
in
the
long
years
he
glanced
up
you
were
willing
to
let
him
and
i
won
you
do
you
think
i
would
want
you
not
that
way
i
want
you
so
little
that
i
coming
with
you
to
help
you
to
prevent
viii
long
lines
of
neglected
tillage
deserted
farms
broken
fences
a
gray
expanse
of
sky
knots
of
peasants
trekking
always
westward
panting
cattle
nearing
the
exhaustion
point
creaking
carts
dawn
growing
whiter
day
growing
golden
sunlight
fading
night
becoming
flecked
with
stars
always
the
rhythm
of
the
engine
the
plunging
into
the
distance
the
impatient
urgency
to
thrust
forward
it
had
been
useless
to
think
of
traveling
by
trains
the
railways
were
too
congested
moreover
they
had
strongly
suspected
that
he
had
set
out
by
car
if
the
no
man
land
beyond
kovel
were
his
destination
then
cracow
would
lie
midway
on
his
journey
cracow
was
one
of
the
in
the
barricade
where
a
clump
of
red
flags
was
flying
all
the
traffic
was
escaping
from
the
danger
if
he
had
chosen
that
route
there
would
be
definite
news
of
him
any
one
traveling
towards
the
danger
could
not
help
but
be
remarked
as
they
inquired
of
fugitives
they
discovered
that
two
cars
were
ahead
of
them
the
first
contained
a
madman
with
eyes
green
as
emeralds
and
a
face
white
and
set
as
a
mask
the
second
a
woman
beautiful
as
a
fallen
angel
the
woman
seemed
to
be
in
pursuit
of
the
man
they
were
perhaps
thirty
miles
apart
they
had
thundered
by
into
the
imperiled
future
as
though
the
devil
rode
behind
them
what
could
be
santa
purpose
anna
and
he
argued
the
point
sometimes
aloud
more
often
in
their
unuttered
thoughts
all
their
old
doubts
concerning
her
rose
up
rampant
was
she
a
bolshevist
agent
hurrying
back
to
sell
the
last
of
her
secrets
was
her
purpose
to
save
or
to
betray
varensky
what
had
she
ever
wanted
from
him
had
she
found
a
quality
in
his
idealism
that
had
called
forth
her
pitying
worship
in
her
own
dark
way
had
she
enshrined
him
in
a
mysterious
corner
of
her
heart
had
she
recognized
in
him
a
childlike
weakness
that
had
compelled
her
protection
had
he
stood
in
the
twilight
of
her
life
for
a
door
that
might
open
into
ultimate
redemption
or
was
it
loneliness
that
had
made
her
follow
him
the
sure
knowledge
that
everything
was
ended
in
those
seven
days
whilst
they
had
made
history
together
had
she
seen
something
that
had
tortured
her
that
she
was
not
wanted
as
he
was
not
wanted
was
it
despair
that
had
beckoned
her
into
the
chaos
through
which
he
hurried
to
destruction
when
they
reached
cracow
it
was
to
find
the
city
deserted
the
streets
by
which
they
entered
were
deathly
silent
the
doors
wide
open
the
pavements
strewn
with
furniture
which
owners
had
lacked
time
to
rescue
here
and
there
were
carts
which
had
collapsed
and
thin
horses
which
had
died
in
harness
even
cats
and
dogs
had
departed
terror
peered
from
behind
the
blankness
of
windows
it
was
like
a
city
pillaged
whatever
optimisms
they
had
entertained
they
knew
for
certain
now
that
war
had
started
out
of
sight
across
gray
wastes
to
the
eastward
gray
ranks
of
skeletons
armed
with
nothing
but
disease
were
approaching
the
dread
they
inspired
was
so
great
that
outcasts
only
a
shade
less
starving
had
stampeded
before
them
at
a
turn
they
came
to
the
railroad
here
their
eyes
met
a
different
spectacle
from
a
on
a
siding
men
white
to
the
eyes
with
dust
were
rolling
barrels
they
were
volunteers
recruited
from
the
safer
nations
the
first
of
the
new
kind
of
army
they
were
piling
flour
where
once
they
would
have
been
stacking
shells
hindwood
recognized
the
barrels
markings
his
sense
of
tragedy
lightened
laughing
down
into
his
companion
eyes
he
shouted
look
anna
mine
that
i
meant
to
sell
a
girl
in
the
tattered
uniform
of
the
battalion
of
death
was
in
charge
coming
up
to
the
car
she
saluted
smartly
yes
she
had
seen
varensky
it
was
three
hours
since
he
had
passed
he
had
filled
up
with
water
and
gasolene
gasolene
having
arrived
on
the
he
had
left
for
stating
that
his
object
was
to
gain
a
respite
for
the
he
proposed
to
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
and
to
check
the
rapidity
of
its
advance
after
his
departure
the
other
had
panted
up
the
woman
only
an
hour
behind
him
wasting
no
time
in
conversation
hindwood
imitated
varensky
example
he
was
dazed
for
want
of
sleep
almost
nodding
but
the
man
he
had
to
save
was
ahead
of
him
having
filled
his
tanks
and
made
sure
of
his
engine
he
started
forward
they
were
throbbing
through
empty
streets
again
when
a
strange
sound
thrilled
the
silence
a
which
rang
out
sharply
across
the
housetops
and
broke
off
suddenly
had
they
come
he
slowed
down
prepared
to
wheel
about
seeing
what
was
in
his
thoughts
anna
rested
her
hand
on
his
arm
reassuringly
from
the
tower
of
mary
how
often
i
heard
it
ah
there
it
is
again
gazing
up
and
bending
forward
she
listened
then
she
spoke
as
though
addressing
some
one
who
walked
above
the
city
fellow
though
they
all
deserted
you
stayed
whom
are
you
talking
she
explained
quickly
centuries
ago
the
church
of
mary
had
been
an
outpost
of
christendom
used
as
a
against
the
invading
tartar
a
soldier
had
been
kept
continually
stationed
there
to
give
warning
on
a
trumpet
of
the
first
approach
of
danger
in
the
fourteenth
century
whilst
arousing
the
city
the
trumpeter
had
been
struck
in
the
throat
by
an
arrow
his
call
had
faltered
rallied
and
sunk
with
his
dying
breath
he
had
sounded
a
final
blast
which
had
broken
off
short
the
broken
call
had
saved
cracow
ever
since
to
commemorate
his
faithfulness
there
had
never
been
an
hour
day
or
night
when
his
broken
ending
abruptly
in
an
abyss
of
silence
had
not
been
sounded
from
the
tower
hindwood
leant
across
the
wheel
staring
dreamily
before
him
might
have
been
his
voice
he
like
that
a
dying
trumpeter
sounding
a
last
warning
i
almost
believe
in
him
it
too
late
may
not
be
she
whispered
night
was
falling
straining
his
eyes
to
keep
awake
he
drove
impetuously
on
forcing
a
path
through
the
opposing
shadows
ix
how
they
had
arrived
it
would
have
puzzled
him
to
tell
he
had
vague
memories
of
sunsets
and
dawns
of
times
when
sleep
had
drugged
him
of
unrefreshed
awakenings
they
had
reached
the
city
fatal
to
the
russians
which
the
czar
had
always
superstitiously
avoided
like
cracow
it
was
deserted
unlike
cracow
it
was
a
pile
of
ruins
seven
times
in
seven
years
it
had
been
bombarded
and
captured
beneath
an
iron
sky
it
listened
for
the
tramp
of
the
latest
conqueror
hindwood
drew
forth
his
map
it
was
over
a
hundred
versts
to
kovel
he
doubted
whether
his
gasolene
would
take
him
there
was
nowhere
where
he
could
replenish
his
supply
before
him
lay
a
no
man
land
from
which
everything
had
perished
behind
a
silence
from
which
everything
had
escaped
to
continue
his
pursuit
was
folly
there
was
no
promise
of
success
to
allure
him
of
varensky
and
santa
he
had
lost
all
trace
he
glanced
at
his
drowsing
companion
he
had
pledged
his
word
to
her
reluctantly
he
climbed
into
his
seat
and
started
forward
the
suicidal
stupidity
of
war
that
was
the
thought
that
absorbed
him
every
sight
that
his
eyes
encountered
emphasized
its
madness
yet
beyond
the
horizon
where
distance
seemed
to
terminate
men
were
killing
one
another
he
understood
at
last
varensky
passion
to
die
when
all
else
had
failed
to
offer
one
body
was
the
only
protest
the
landscape
was
growing
featureless
rivers
had
overflowed
the
labor
of
centuries
was
sinking
beneath
morass
villages
and
had
been
destroyed
woods
torn
by
stationed
along
the
route
like
buoys
guarding
a
channel
black
and
white
gleamed
monotonously
on
either
side
stretched
a
graveyard
marked
by
rough
crosses
or
inverted
rifles
down
this
pitiless
straight
road
had
marched
the
seven
invasions
russian
german
polish
bolshevist
each
with
a
dream
of
glory
in
its
eyes
with
the
victory
lost
and
the
dream
forgotten
they
moldered
companionably
it
was
to
kovel
that
he
first
noticed
what
was
happening
behind
scrub
and
fallen
trees
it
had
probably
been
happening
for
some
time
it
was
a
gray
wolf
grown
bold
which
first
drew
his
attention
like
a
dog
seeking
its
master
it
came
trotting
down
the
road
after
that
they
came
in
packs
not
only
wolves
but
every
other
kind
of
untamed
animal
it
was
as
though
they
were
fleeing
before
a
drive
the
tremendous
drive
of
a
famished
nation
in
their
dread
they
seemed
to
have
postponed
their
right
to
prey
hunter
and
quarry
journeyed
side
by
side
their
enmities
in
abeyance
in
their
common
terror
of
the
enmity
which
stalked
behind
hindwood
had
grown
used
to
the
spectacle
when
suddenly
he
was
startled
by
another
sight
a
child
a
child
so
matted
and
neglected
that
he
scarcely
recognized
him
as
human
his
feet
were
swathed
in
balls
of
rags
he
limped
painfully
walking
among
the
animals
and
staring
straight
before
him
at
shortening
intervals
others
followed
till
at
last
they
came
in
crowds
beyond
kovel
where
commences
the
crumbling
in
which
the
vanished
armies
remained
locked
for
so
many
years
he
came
across
his
first
trace
of
varensky
an
abandoned
car
with
a
broken
axle
varensky
must
be
on
foot
not
far
ahead
he
had
passed
another
mile
when
his
own
car
halted
the
gasolene
had
given
out
with
the
ceasing
of
the
engine
he
caught
another
sound
the
popping
of
it
dawned
on
him
that
the
trenches
of
the
dead
battlefield
were
again
inhabited
he
had
been
driving
straight
into
the
heart
of
the
fighting
the
firing
was
drawing
nearer
the
monarchists
were
falling
back
a
bullet
whizzed
over
his
head
and
pinged
into
a
mass
of
rusted
wire
all
that
followed
happened
in
a
flash
he
had
seized
anna
and
rushed
with
her
to
cover
from
where
he
watched
he
could
see
soldiers
retreating
and
the
tops
of
steel
helmets
bobbing
above
the
trenches
of
the
advancing
host
he
could
see
nothing
suddenly
from
behind
a
mound
a
man
with
a
peaked
head
sprang
up
he
was
dressed
as
a
civilian
he
commenced
to
run
up
the
road
towards
the
enemy
waving
something
white
immediately
from
another
place
of
hiding
a
woman
leapt
up
and
followed
it
was
as
though
on
the
instant
truce
had
been
declared
a
tranquillity
of
amazement
settled
down
as
he
reached
what
appeared
to
be
no
man
land
he
drew
himself
erect
with
expanded
chest
and
commenced
to
sweep
his
arms
in
the
gestures
of
oratory
it
was
dumb
show
it
was
impossible
to
hear
what
was
being
said
while
he
was
speaking
the
woman
caught
up
with
him
and
flung
herself
upon
him
making
a
shield
of
her
body
curiosity
satisfied
both
sides
fired
the
man
and
woman
crumpled
fighting
recommenced
the
end
