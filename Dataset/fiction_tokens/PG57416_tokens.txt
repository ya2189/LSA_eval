the
prologue
chapter
i
we
fly
by
night
when
the
nineteenth
century
was
still
a
puling
infant
scarcely
able
to
stand
alone
and
not
yet
knowing
what
to
make
of
the
strange
into
which
it
found
itself
born
abel
ringwood
and
sarah
his
wife
were
respectively
landlord
and
landlady
of
the
king
arms
a
noted
commercial
hotel
and
at
appleford
a
town
in
the
north
of
england
on
one
of
the
great
coach
roads
from
the
south
to
scotland
all
his
majesty
mails
which
travelled
by
that
route
stopped
to
change
horses
at
the
king
arms
and
as
there
was
a
great
deal
of
private
posting
by
noblemen
and
rich
commoners
in
those
days
the
hotel
stables
had
seldom
fewer
than
from
twenty
to
thirty
horses
in
them
at
one
time
in
view
of
the
fact
that
appleford
was
and
is
on
the
from
the
south
to
gretna
green
it
was
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
that
a
week
seldom
passed
without
one
or
more
runaway
couples
stopping
to
change
horses
at
the
king
arms
and
then
hurrying
on
again
as
hard
as
they
could
go
thus
there
was
nothing
out
of
the
common
when
about
six
on
a
certain
december
evening
a
dashed
up
to
the
hotel
door
containing
a
runaway
couple
and
a
maid
the
gentleman
although
he
seemed
in
a
desperate
hurry
to
get
on
induced
the
young
lady
to
alight
in
order
to
relieve
her
cramped
limbs
while
fresh
horses
were
being
put
into
the
chaise
and
the
lamps
freshly
trimmed
she
declined
all
refreshment
but
he
partook
of
a
glass
of
sherry
and
a
biscuit
while
a
glass
of
steaming
negus
was
handed
to
the
maid
inside
the
young
lady
who
was
dressed
from
head
to
foot
in
expensive
furs
was
exceedingly
pretty
with
large
eyes
and
a
wistful
smile
the
gentleman
was
enveloped
in
a
long
military
cloak
and
was
evidently
connected
with
the
army
in
three
minutes
and
a
half
they
were
on
the
road
again
everybody
there
down
to
the
wished
them
and
a
happy
ending
to
their
adventure
the
evening
was
clear
and
frosty
there
had
been
a
slight
fall
of
snow
in
the
afternoon
which
still
lay
crisp
and
white
on
the
hard
roads
the
moon
would
rise
in
less
than
an
hour
no
long
time
passed
before
it
was
known
throughout
the
hotel
who
the
runaways
were
the
whispered
the
news
to
john
ostler
who
a
few
minutes
later
told
it
to
his
mistress
the
lady
was
miss
dulcie
peyton
the
niece
and
ward
of
sir
peter
warrendale
of
scrope
hall
near
whatton
regis
the
gentleman
was
a
captain
pascoe
the
heir
of
an
old
but
impoverished
family
according
to
report
sir
peter
had
set
his
heart
on
his
marrying
some
one
who
was
utterly
distasteful
to
her
and
with
more
anger
than
politeness
had
shown
captain
pascoe
the
door
when
that
gentleman
had
called
upon
him
to
ask
permission
to
pay
his
addresses
to
miss
dulcie
it
was
further
reported
that
for
the
last
three
months
or
more
the
poor
young
lady
had
been
virtually
a
prisoner
never
on
any
pretence
being
allowed
outside
the
precincts
of
the
park
and
that
sir
peter
vowed
a
prisoner
she
should
remain
till
the
last
hour
of
his
guardianship
had
struck
which
would
not
be
for
three
long
years
to
come
but
bolts
and
bars
can
not
keep
love
out
nor
in
either
for
that
matter
the
pretty
bird
had
escaped
from
its
cage
and
everybody
devoutly
hoped
that
it
would
not
be
recaptured
the
runagates
had
not
been
gone
more
than
forty
minutes
when
up
dashed
another
out
of
which
bounced
a
very
gentleman
presumably
sir
peter
warrendale
who
with
much
spluttering
and
several
expletives
ordered
fresh
horses
to
be
instantly
put
into
the
chaise
and
then
perceiving
comely
ringwood
where
she
sat
among
the
glasses
and
bottles
in
her
little
snuggery
he
strode
up
to
her
and
in
his
arrogant
way
demanded
to
know
whether
she
had
seen
anything
of
a
runaway
couple
who
so
he
was
credibly
informed
had
passed
through
appleford
a
little
while
before
on
their
way
to
gretna
green
now
the
conscience
of
the
worthy
landlady
was
of
that
tender
kind
that
it
would
not
allow
her
to
tell
a
lie
but
in
order
to
give
the
fugitives
a
few
minutes
more
start
she
asked
him
to
describe
the
two
persons
to
whom
he
referred
this
he
did
in
very
few
words
and
nothing
was
then
left
ringwood
but
to
confess
that
she
had
seen
the
young
people
in
question
and
that
they
had
changed
horses
there
about
an
hour
before
on
hearing
this
the
gentleman
indulged
in
more
bad
language
ordered
a
glass
of
hot
which
half
choked
him
in
his
hurry
to
swallow
it
and
then
still
growling
savagely
in
his
throat
was
shut
up
next
minute
in
his
chaise
and
driven
rapidly
away
one
small
service
ringwood
had
been
able
to
do
the
runaways
she
had
secretly
told
john
ostler
to
let
them
have
the
two
best
horses
in
the
stables
and
the
latter
of
his
own
accord
had
supplied
the
gentleman
with
the
two
worst
unless
something
unforeseen
should
happen
there
was
not
much
likelihood
of
the
fugitives
being
overtaken
everything
was
going
well
with
them
they
had
left
appleford
about
a
dozen
miles
behind
and
had
pretty
well
got
over
the
worst
part
of
the
fells
when
one
of
the
horses
fell
lame
and
it
quickly
became
apparent
that
the
poor
animal
was
unable
to
go
at
any
pace
faster
than
a
walk
and
that
only
with
difficulty
what
was
to
be
done
the
next
place
where
they
could
hope
to
obtain
fresh
horses
was
five
or
six
miles
ahead
and
it
was
almost
a
certainty
that
before
they
could
get
so
far
they
would
be
overtaken
by
sir
peter
who
they
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
was
in
close
pursuit
of
them
the
suggested
that
they
should
tie
the
lame
horse
to
a
tree
by
the
roadside
leaving
it
to
be
fetched
later
on
and
press
forward
as
fast
as
possible
with
the
remaining
horse
but
even
so
the
chances
were
that
the
irate
sir
peter
would
overtake
them
before
another
hour
had
gone
by
it
was
a
desperate
chance
but
no
other
was
left
them
the
had
just
tied
up
the
lame
horse
and
was
on
the
point
of
mounting
the
other
when
not
more
than
a
dozen
yards
from
the
chaise
and
as
if
he
had
sprung
that
moment
out
of
the
ground
a
masked
horseman
leaped
the
rough
wall
that
divided
the
from
the
fells
stand
or
you
are
a
dead
man
he
exclaimed
in
commanding
tones
as
he
presented
a
pistol
at
the
postboys
head
then
turning
to
the
chaise
window
which
was
open
and
at
the
same
moment
flashing
a
lantern
on
the
travellers
good
people
your
money
or
your
lives
he
said
the
maid
gave
utterance
to
a
scream
but
the
young
lady
only
clung
in
terrified
silence
to
her
lover
arm
a
network
of
filmy
clouds
covered
the
sky
but
the
moon
which
had
now
risen
gave
enough
light
to
enable
the
postilion
to
see
that
the
highwayman
was
mounted
on
a
powerful
black
horse
with
a
white
stocking
on
its
near
and
a
white
star
on
its
forehead
that
he
wore
a
beaver
hat
that
his
mask
just
reached
to
the
tip
of
his
nose
and
that
his
outer
garment
was
a
dark
horseman
cloak
with
several
capes
to
it
i
durst
wager
a
thousand
pounds
to
a
farden
it
captain
nightshade
he
muttered
under
his
breath
sir
said
the
young
captain
bending
forward
so
that
his
face
was
in
a
line
with
the
open
window
speaking
with
much
dignity
and
a
ceremonious
politeness
more
common
in
those
days
than
now
here
is
my
watch
together
with
that
of
this
lady
and
here
are
our
purses
but
if
the
feelings
of
a
gentleman
are
still
cherished
by
you
and
by
your
accent
i
judge
you
to
be
one
and
if
the
sentiments
of
our
common
humanity
have
still
power
to
appeal
to
your
heart
i
beg
and
entreat
that
you
do
not
leave
us
wholly
destitute
of
the
means
wherewith
to
prosecute
our
journey
i
and
this
lady
are
on
our
way
to
gretna
green
she
has
escaped
from
the
custody
of
a
most
tyrannical
uncle
who
is
also
her
guardian
and
who
would
fain
force
her
into
marriage
with
a
man
whom
she
detests
that
he
is
in
pursuit
of
us
and
no
great
distance
behind
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
now
sir
should
you
be
sufficiently
to
deprive
us
of
the
whole
of
our
funds
even
should
we
by
some
miracle
be
enabled
to
reach
the
end
of
our
journey
the
needful
gold
would
still
be
lacking
wherewith
to
forge
that
link
of
hymen
which
would
give
me
a
husband
right
to
protect
this
dear
girl
from
all
the
tyrannical
uncles
in
existence
the
highwayman
had
listened
attentively
the
reins
lay
on
his
neck
his
left
hand
held
the
lantern
the
light
from
which
shone
full
into
the
body
of
the
chaise
his
right
grasped
a
pistol
the
barrel
of
which
gleamed
coldly
in
the
moonlight
sir
not
another
word
i
entreat
he
said
when
the
captain
had
done
speaking
bowing
low
and
withdrawing
the
light
of
his
lantern
at
the
same
moment
never
shall
it
be
said
of
me
that
i
took
toll
of
lovers
in
distress
rather
would
i
do
all
that
in
me
lies
to
aid
them
as
far
as
my
poor
powers
might
avail
sir
i
thank
you
most
heartily
answered
the
captain
with
as
much
as
though
he
were
addressing
a
duke
one
of
your
horses
has
fallen
lame
is
it
not
so
demanded
the
robber
alas
yes
and
the
chances
are
a
score
to
one
that
we
shall
be
overtaken
by
sir
peter
before
we
can
reach
any
place
where
we
can
obtain
fresh
ones
the
highwayman
who
had
put
back
his
pistol
into
its
holster
refreshed
himself
with
a
pinch
of
snuff
from
a
box
the
jewels
in
which
flashed
in
the
moonbeams
before
he
spoke
then
he
said
in
that
case
sir
it
seems
to
me
there
is
only
one
thing
left
you
to
do
and
that
is
queried
the
captain
eagerly
for
you
and
the
young
lady
to
make
use
of
my
mare
to
speed
you
on
your
journey
leila
will
carry
the
pair
of
you
to
gretna
and
be
as
fresh
as
a
daisy
at
the
end
of
it
and
as
for
sir
peter
overtaking
you
his
scornful
laugh
rang
clear
through
the
frosty
night
captain
pascoe
might
be
excused
if
he
fairly
gasped
for
breath
as
he
listened
to
this
extraordinary
proposition
but
it
was
far
too
good
an
offer
to
be
lightly
refused
as
a
matter
of
politeness
he
made
some
slight
demur
which
the
highwayman
promptly
overruled
and
three
minutes
later
he
was
astride
the
black
mare
then
the
highwayman
taking
the
young
lady
round
the
waist
swung
her
lightly
on
to
the
crupper
but
what
is
to
become
of
you
queried
the
captain
never
fear
for
me
sir
replied
the
other
i
shall
know
how
to
take
care
of
myself
then
in
a
low
voice
he
gave
the
captain
certain
instructions
where
to
leave
the
mare
which
he
would
send
a
trusty
man
to
reclaim
on
the
morrow
then
the
captain
held
out
his
hand
which
the
other
frankly
grasped
it
is
the
hand
of
one
he
said
who
under
different
circumstances
would
doubtless
have
been
a
different
man
then
the
two
men
lifted
their
hats
the
lady
waved
her
hand
and
half
a
minute
later
black
leila
and
her
double
burden
had
disappeared
round
a
turn
of
the
road
chapter
ii
on
the
king
highway
the
amazed
was
now
directed
to
put
the
lame
horse
back
into
its
place
and
go
slowly
ahead
while
the
highwayman
himself
took
the
captain
place
inside
the
chaise
do
you
be
frightened
my
dear
he
said
to
the
trembling
whom
her
young
mistress
had
done
her
best
to
reassure
before
leaving
her
i
love
your
sex
far
too
dearly
ever
to
harm
one
of
you
with
your
leave
i
will
ride
part
of
the
way
with
you
and
should
anybody
ask
my
name
you
may
call
me
mr
darke
he
removed
his
mask
as
he
spoke
but
it
was
too
dark
inside
the
chaise
to
allow
of
his
features
being
distinguished
even
if
the
had
not
been
too
terrified
to
do
more
than
glance
furtively
at
him
they
had
gone
on
slowly
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
it
became
evident
that
some
other
vehicle
was
approaching
them
rapidly
from
the
rear
keep
your
veil
down
and
do
say
a
word
said
darke
to
his
companion
after
a
backward
glance
through
the
open
window
he
drew
his
hat
down
over
his
brows
and
turned
up
the
collar
of
his
redingote
about
his
ears
so
that
even
had
it
been
daylight
little
of
his
face
would
have
been
visible
it
was
not
unlikely
that
the
sir
peter
of
whom
mention
had
been
made
might
do
the
same
as
he
had
done
throw
the
light
of
a
lantern
on
the
inmates
of
the
chaise
presently
the
pursuing
chaise
came
up
at
a
great
pace
the
lashing
his
horses
freely
and
passing
the
other
one
drew
up
suddenly
some
dozen
yards
ahead
straight
across
the
narrow
road
so
as
effectually
to
bar
its
progress
and
bring
it
to
a
stand
darke
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
stoppage
he
called
why
do
you
go
on
ca
do
it
sir
road
blocked
by
shay
before
more
could
be
said
sir
peter
himself
came
stalking
up
trembling
with
rage
followed
by
his
servant
with
a
lantern
so
so
sir
your
nefarious
scheme
has
not
succeeded
your
villainous
plot
has
miscarried
as
it
deserved
to
do
he
stuttered
his
words
tumbling
headlong
over
each
other
in
his
passion
i
have
the
law
of
you
sir
for
this
you
shall
be
taught
that
you
can
not
run
off
with
a
gentleman
ward
with
impunity
you
shall
be
cast
for
damages
sir
five
thousand
pounds
not
one
farthing
less
damme
but
where
is
that
niece
of
mine
the
shameless
hussy
i
will
may
i
ask
sir
the
meaning
of
this
singular
outrage
demanded
a
grave
stern
voice
from
the
interior
of
the
chaise
if
his
liege
subjects
are
to
be
stopped
on
the
highway
by
every
inebriate
brawler
it
is
indeed
time
for
the
hand
of
authority
to
intervene
i
am
myself
in
the
commission
of
peace
and
i
must
demand
from
you
your
name
and
address
sir
in
order
that
further
inquiry
may
be
made
into
this
most
discreditable
proceeding
but
by
this
time
the
servant
had
directed
the
rays
of
his
lantern
into
the
interior
of
the
chaise
sir
peter
stood
like
a
man
petrified
in
the
farther
corner
sat
a
thin
angular
woman
bolt
upright
and
as
rigid
as
a
ramrod
who
although
her
face
was
hidden
by
a
thick
veil
no
one
in
his
senses
would
for
a
moment
mistake
for
miss
dulcie
peyton
and
it
was
doubtless
owing
to
the
veil
that
he
failed
to
recognize
in
her
that
young
lady
maid
with
whose
features
he
was
presumably
not
unfamiliar
of
the
person
who
had
addressed
him
little
could
be
seen
save
a
large
aquiline
nose
and
a
pair
of
fierce
black
eyes
it
was
equally
impossible
however
to
confound
him
with
captain
pascoe
i
crave
your
pardon
sir
said
sir
peter
in
a
tone
of
almost
abject
apology
as
he
took
off
his
hat
and
made
a
ceremonious
bow
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
for
my
stupid
blunder
but
the
fact
is
i
mistook
your
chaise
for
the
one
in
which
a
niece
of
mine
confound
her
is
at
the
present
moment
on
her
way
to
gretna
green
we
had
tidings
of
her
at
the
place
where
we
last
changed
horses
and
i
made
sure
that
the
first
chaise
we
should
overtake
must
be
the
one
of
which
we
were
in
pursuit
sir
your
apology
makes
ample
amends
responded
darke
in
the
most
gracious
of
tones
your
mistake
was
a
most
natural
one
no
doubt
the
flight
of
your
niece
has
been
a
source
of
much
annoyance
to
you
the
scowl
on
sir
peter
face
was
not
pleasant
to
see
if
once
i
clap
hands
on
her
she
wo
escape
me
again
bolts
and
bars
and
that
the
only
treatment
for
refractory
wenches
but
pardon
me
for
not
introducing
myself
i
am
sir
peter
warrendale
of
scrope
hall
near
whatton
regis
and
i
colonel
delnay
of
scowthwaite
by
carlisle
at
this
point
the
two
gentlemen
bowed
ceremoniously
to
each
other
i
trust
sir
peter
to
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
on
some
more
auspicious
occasion
with
all
my
heart
colonel
i
reciprocate
the
wish
but
i
forgetting
all
about
my
runaway
niece
may
i
ask
whether
anything
has
passed
you
on
the
road
at
all
resembling
a
couple
in
a
nothing
resembling
what
you
speak
of
sir
peter
i
give
you
my
word
most
likely
they
have
a
with
them
who
is
acquainted
with
the
short
cut
across
the
fells
it
a
dangerous
road
for
a
chaise
to
traverse
after
dark
and
the
chances
are
that
they
will
come
to
grief
before
they
reach
the
end
of
it
i
give
a
hundred
guineas
damme
if
i
would
if
one
of
their
was
to
drop
out
but
i
may
yet
be
in
time
to
overtake
and
so
with
a
few
more
polite
phrases
on
both
sides
the
two
men
parted
no
sooner
had
the
other
chaise
started
on
its
way
than
darke
lay
back
in
his
seat
and
gave
vent
to
a
burst
of
hearty
laughter
then
in
a
full
rich
voice
he
sang
as
under
you
may
ride
through
the
night
nor
draw
rein
all
the
day
change
horse
as
you
list
and
tantivy
away
but
from
humber
to
ribble
derwent
and
dee
you
find
a
trace
of
sweet
ellen
poor
uncle
poor
sir
peter
he
exclaimed
his
pretty
niece
will
have
been
wed
a
couple
of
hours
ere
he
crosses
the
border
what
a
surly
old
curmudgeon
he
looks
no
wonder
his
little
bird
was
tired
of
its
cage
and
seized
the
first
chance
to
flutter
its
wings
and
away
when
they
had
gone
about
a
mile
further
he
called
to
the
to
stop
and
alighted
from
the
chaise
dipping
his
hand
into
one
of
his
capacious
pockets
he
drew
out
something
which
he
presented
with
a
bow
to
the
maid
here
a
trifle
for
you
my
dear
to
keep
you
in
mind
of
darke
he
said
and
now
i
must
wish
you
goodnight
and
with
the
hope
that
one
of
these
days
you
will
be
run
away
with
by
as
gallant
a
gentleman
as
he
who
has
carried
off
your
mistress
with
that
he
took
off
his
hat
and
swept
her
a
low
bow
with
all
the
grace
imaginable
then
stepping
up
to
the
he
put
a
couple
of
guineas
into
his
hand
just
to
drink
my
health
with
as
he
said
later
he
was
lost
to
view
in
a
plantation
of
young
trees
which
at
that
point
lined
one
side
of
the
road
the
present
he
had
given
the
maid
proved
to
be
a
sweetmeat
box
of
elaborate
workmanship
which
had
doubtless
at
one
time
been
the
property
of
some
person
of
quality
some
six
weeks
later
than
the
events
just
recorded
ringwood
the
landlady
of
the
king
arms
was
drinking
a
dish
of
tea
with
her
friend
miss
capp
who
had
been
from
home
for
a
couple
of
months
and
was
agog
to
hear
all
the
news
the
young
people
had
been
three
hours
married
by
the
time
sir
peter
reached
gretna
green
said
the
landlady
in
continuation
of
what
had
gone
before
he
stormed
and
raved
as
a
matter
of
course
and
vowed
he
would
have
the
law
of
captain
pascoe
but
it
was
well
known
that
he
would
never
have
dared
to
go
into
court
and
let
the
world
know
with
how
much
cruelty
he
had
treated
his
orphan
niece
when
the
captain
and
his
bride
came
south
a
week
later
they
stopped
and
dined
at
the
arms
and
it
was
then
i
learned
all
the
particulars
i
have
just
told
you
of
their
strange
adventure
but
what
about
darke
what
about
the
highwayman
queried
miss
capp
eagerly
i
can
tell
you
very
little
about
him
as
to
who
he
really
was
nothing
has
ever
come
out
he
may
have
been
the
notorious
captain
nightshade
as
the
firmly
believes
or
he
may
not
the
says
he
recognized
him
by
the
horse
he
was
riding
a
black
mare
with
a
white
stocking
on
the
near
and
a
white
blaze
on
the
forehead
in
any
case
the
act
was
that
of
one
who
had
not
forgotten
that
once
on
a
time
he
was
a
gentleman
it
was
the
act
of
one
who
whatever
his
other
faults
may
be
has
not
yet
forfeited
all
right
to
that
title
responded
the
enthusiastic
spinster
who
envied
miss
peyton
maid
her
adventure
by
the
way
i
must
forget
to
tell
you
that
poor
sir
peter
was
unlucky
enough
to
be
stopped
on
his
way
back
from
gretna
green
and
eased
of
his
watch
and
purse
together
with
his
which
latter
it
seems
he
set
great
store
by
it
being
a
sort
of
family
heirloom
and
i
have
it
from
the
in
charge
of
the
chaise
that
as
the
highwayman
was
on
the
point
of
riding
away
he
lifted
his
hat
and
said
delnay
has
the
honor
sir
peter
to
wish
you
a
very
goodnight
the
narrative
chapter
i
a
prentice
hand
among
other
wayfarers
who
on
a
certain
evening
some
four
months
subsequently
to
the
events
already
narrated
halted
at
the
king
arms
hotel
appleford
in
order
to
refresh
the
inner
man
was
a
stranger
on
horseback
with
a
rather
bulky
strapped
behind
him
who
judging
from
his
style
and
appearance
might
have
been
a
cattle
jobber
on
his
way
to
some
fair
or
farm
bailiff
a
statesman
who
farmed
his
own
acres
and
had
a
comfortable
little
balance
at
the
local
bank
or
at
any
rate
a
man
used
to
a
healthy
outdoor
country
life
to
whom
existence
in
a
town
would
have
been
nothing
less
than
intolerable
having
dismounted
from
his
very
serviceable
nag
he
gave
it
into
the
ostler
charge
with
strict
injunctions
that
it
was
to
be
well
cared
for
and
then
made
for
the
where
five
minutes
later
he
was
seated
with
a
noble
cold
sirloin
before
him
and
at
his
elbow
a
tankard
of
the
best
old
ale
the
house
could
supply
he
was
a
prime
trencherman
was
john
dyce
they
were
common
enough
in
those
days
and
it
would
have
made
a
modern
dyspeptic
stare
to
watch
the
heroic
way
in
which
he
attacked
the
sirloin
and
with
what
unequivocal
appetite
one
slice
after
another
with
its
accompaniment
of
delicious
bread
was
disposed
of
but
not
even
john
could
go
on
eating
forever
and
by
and
by
he
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
with
an
audible
sigh
which
might
be
partly
due
to
the
satisfaction
which
comes
or
should
come
of
comfortable
repletion
and
partly
a
sigh
of
regret
at
having
to
bid
farewell
to
the
sirloin
while
the
waiter
cleared
away
he
went
as
far
as
the
stable
in
order
to
satisfy
himself
that
his
nag
was
being
properly
looked
after
he
was
gone
some
little
time
and
when
he
came
back
he
ordered
a
churchwarden
pipe
a
screw
of
tobacco
and
a
tumbler
of
cold
punch
to
be
brought
him
there
were
some
people
in
the
room
who
had
been
there
when
he
arrived
and
a
number
of
others
had
come
and
gone
in
the
interim
now
and
then
a
bell
would
be
heard
to
ring
somewhere
indoors
now
and
then
a
chaise
or
other
vehicle
would
rattle
up
to
the
door
and
come
to
an
abrupt
stand
the
coach
going
south
had
stopped
for
exactly
three
minutes
and
a
half
in
order
to
change
horses
during
which
time
a
majority
of
the
passengers
had
crowded
into
the
hotel
clamoring
for
drinks
of
various
kinds
john
dyce
sitting
apart
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
long
room
and
puffing
meditatively
at
his
churchwarden
had
a
quietly
observant
eye
for
every
fresh
face
that
came
in
at
length
but
not
till
his
glance
had
travelled
more
than
once
with
some
anxiety
in
it
to
the
clock
over
the
his
waiting
was
rewarded
the
door
opened
and
there
entered
a
little
man
in
whose
features
professional
gravity
seemed
to
be
struggling
against
a
latent
sense
of
humor
he
was
tew
managing
clerk
to
piljoy
solicitor
of
arkrigg
a
town
at
the
other
end
of
the
county
his
employer
being
laid
up
with
gout
he
had
been
sent
to
stanbrook
in
his
stead
in
order
to
get
squire
cortelyon
will
duly
signed
and
witnessed
having
accomplished
his
errand
he
was
now
on
his
way
back
home
with
the
will
carefully
buttoned
up
inside
his
breast
pocket
squire
cortelyon
was
not
expected
to
live
from
hour
to
hour
surtout
with
black
velvet
collar
muttered
john
dyce
to
himself
front
tooth
broken
short
off
red
and
black
silk
muffler
round
his
throat
white
beaver
hat
the
worse
for
wear
it
must
be
him
tew
beckoned
the
waiter
ham
and
eggs
and
a
cup
of
strong
coffee
and
let
me
have
them
as
quick
as
possible
i
must
be
on
the
road
again
in
half
an
hour
yessir
have
in
a
jiffy
going
far
sir
may
i
ask
only
as
far
as
arkrigg
a
dozen
long
miles
sir
and
as
nasty
a
bit
o
road
as
any
in
the
county
being
nearly
all
and
windin
in
an
out
among
the
moors
let
alone
its
bein
such
a
favorite
road
with
captain
nightshade
then
insinuatingly
better
stay
where
you
are
sir
could
put
you
up
very
comfortable
his
grace
of
malvern
stayed
with
us
a
night
last
month
and
before
goin
away
he
says
says
he
no
no
broke
in
tew
waiters
in
our
days
were
often
privileged
mortals
it
not
a
bit
of
use
your
trying
to
tempt
me
home
i
must
get
highly
important
and
as
for
captain
nightshade
he
flies
at
higher
game
than
the
likes
of
me
if
he
were
to
strip
me
to
the
shirt
all
i
have
would
hardly
fetch
him
the
price
of
a
decent
dinner
and
a
bottle
of
wine
so
now
for
my
ham
and
eggs
not
a
word
of
all
this
had
escaped
john
dyce
but
his
stolid
face
was
absolutely
devoid
of
expression
he
had
changed
his
position
to
the
settle
near
the
and
was
sitting
with
one
hand
buried
deep
in
his
breeches
pocket
while
the
other
held
his
long
pipe
his
gaze
meanwhile
being
contemplatively
fixed
on
a
corner
of
the
ceiling
he
had
already
paid
his
shot
and
he
now
put
down
his
pipe
stood
up
yawned
stretched
himself
and
then
after
clapping
his
hat
on
his
head
strode
slowly
out
of
the
room
passing
the
bar
now
empty
of
customers
through
the
inner
window
of
which
he
could
see
the
plump
landlady
busy
with
her
he
paused
for
a
few
moments
at
the
top
of
the
flight
of
broad
shallow
steps
which
led
up
to
the
front
door
like
so
many
similar
establishments
in
those
days
the
king
arms
hotel
formed
three
sides
of
a
quadrangle
with
the
windows
facing
into
it
the
fourth
side
consisting
of
an
open
gateway
large
enough
for
a
to
be
driven
through
with
ease
having
shops
on
either
side
the
windows
of
which
fronted
on
the
main
street
as
john
dyce
stood
on
the
topmost
step
he
looked
to
right
and
he
looked
to
left
for
a
small
provincial
town
the
hour
was
growing
late
in
the
inn
yard
no
one
was
about
a
light
shone
dimly
through
the
stable
window
and
in
one
corner
tew
chaise
with
two
or
three
other
vehicles
made
a
confused
heap
dimly
discernible
half
an
hour
later
with
the
arrival
of
the
bound
for
edinburgh
the
whole
place
would
wake
up
as
at
the
stroke
of
an
enchanter
wand
to
a
brief
spasm
of
feverish
energy
and
excitement
meanwhile
somnolence
reigned
john
dyce
whistling
under
his
breath
descended
the
steps
and
picked
his
way
slowly
in
the
direction
of
the
stable
presumably
in
search
of
the
ostler
but
it
was
not
till
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
later
that
he
rode
out
of
the
inn
yard
and
having
crossed
the
took
the
road
which
led
due
north
out
of
the
town
the
clock
of
the
old
church
chimed
the
past
ten
as
he
left
it
behind
a
crescent
moon
was
sailing
in
a
clear
sky
presently
john
nag
broke
into
a
gentle
trot
and
so
the
two
jogged
quietly
along
till
the
last
house
in
appleford
had
been
left
some
four
miles
behind
then
at
a
point
where
the
road
dipping
a
little
cut
through
the
dark
heart
of
a
plantation
of
firs
he
drew
rein
and
let
his
horse
subside
into
a
walk
he
had
got
about
halfway
through
the
plantation
when
a
little
way
ahead
of
him
what
looked
like
an
irregular
fragment
of
the
blackness
which
walled
him
in
on
either
hand
broke
itself
away
as
it
were
and
moving
out
into
the
middle
of
the
road
showed
there
clear
and
distinct
by
the
light
of
the
young
moon
and
then
as
he
drew
a
pace
or
two
nearer
took
on
itself
the
shape
of
another
horse
and
another
rider
john
seemed
in
nowise
alarmed
by
the
sudden
apparition
but
rather
indeed
as
if
the
was
not
unexpected
by
him
so
it
is
you
i
was
rather
doubtful
at
first
said
the
other
in
a
full
rich
voice
as
he
drew
near
well
what
luck
have
you
had
as
well
as
could
be
seen
the
speaker
was
a
young
and
very
handsome
man
with
an
unmistakable
air
of
distinction
his
outer
garment
was
a
long
loose
dark
blue
cloak
without
sleeves
fastened
at
the
throat
by
a
silver
clasp
which
hid
the
rest
of
his
attire
except
his
long
riding
boots
and
his
small
hat
his
dark
hair
the
real
color
of
which
could
not
be
distinguished
by
that
light
was
slightly
sprinkled
with
powder
and
tied
up
behind
with
black
ribbon
into
the
form
of
an
ample
queue
his
hands
were
covered
by
a
pair
of
buff
gauntlets
and
from
the
holsters
in
front
of
him
the
stocks
of
a
brace
of
pistols
bulged
menacingly
john
dyce
carried
a
finger
to
his
forehead
as
his
nag
came
to
halt
everything
gone
off
all
right
your
honor
he
said
in
reply
to
the
young
man
question
i
left
tew
at
the
king
arms
in
appleford
he
just
ordered
his
supper
but
seemed
in
a
hurry
to
get
on
and
i
should
say
that
by
this
time
he
nearly
ready
to
start
again
so
that
your
honor
wait
for
him
should
be
a
long
one
before
coming
away
i
managed
unseen
by
anybody
to
draw
the
charges
of
his
pistols
which
he
had
left
behind
him
in
the
chaise
when
he
went
in
to
supper
well
done
john
there
far
more
in
that
head
of
years
than
most
people
give
you
credit
for
but
now
you
must
leave
me
i
will
await
tew
here
i
do
think
i
could
find
a
more
convenient
bit
of
road
for
my
purpose
than
this
you
will
wait
for
me
as
arranged
at
the
first
on
the
whinbarrow
road
better
not
send
me
away
your
honor
said
john
in
a
tone
of
earnest
entreaty
better
let
me
keep
with
you
or
at
least
be
within
hail
in
case
of
accident
no
no
john
i
wo
have
you
mixed
up
in
the
affair
more
than
is
absolutely
necessary
there
nothing
to
fear
more
especially
now
that
you
have
drawn
the
charges
of
the
pistols
but
at
the
best
of
times
i
do
believe
tew
has
an
ounce
of
courage
in
that
plump
body
of
his
more
likely
than
not
he
will
take
me
for
captain
nightshade
and
be
all
with
fright
so
you
must
just
do
as
you
are
bidden
and
make
the
best
of
your
way
to
the
place
agreed
upon
and
remember
i
forbid
you
on
any
account
to
wait
about
here
john
attempted
no
further
protest
knowing
probably
how
futile
it
would
have
been
but
wheeling
his
nag
round
without
a
word
more
started
off
down
the
road
at
a
gentle
trot
the
young
man
waited
without
stirring
till
the
last
thud
of
his
horse
hoofs
had
died
into
silence
then
he
shivered
the
night
was
bitter
enough
to
excuse
his
doing
so
and
drew
his
cloak
more
closely
around
him
and
then
he
glanced
about
him
somewhat
timorously
it
might
have
been
thought
pish
what
folly
is
this
he
muttered
peevishly
a
gentleman
of
the
road
a
despoiler
of
timid
travellers
shivering
and
shaking
because
he
finds
himself
alone
drawing
on
for
midnight
on
a
solitary
bit
of
the
king
highway
i
shall
be
frightened
of
my
own
shadow
next
captain
nightshade
would
indeed
laugh
me
to
scorn
he
patted
his
mare
on
the
neck
and
began
to
walk
her
up
and
down
on
the
narrow
stretch
of
turf
which
fringed
the
road
on
either
hand
it
was
not
one
of
the
great
thoroughfares
running
north
and
south
busy
day
and
night
with
traffic
in
one
or
other
of
its
manifold
forms
but
merely
a
between
one
provincial
town
and
another
the
only
living
things
seen
by
our
young
horseman
while
he
waited
were
a
drove
of
cattle
in
charge
of
a
couple
of
men
on
their
way
to
appleford
market
while
they
were
passing
he
withdrew
into
the
shade
of
the
plantation
after
all
he
had
hardly
so
long
to
wait
as
he
had
feared
he
would
have
john
dyce
had
not
been
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
gone
when
his
straining
ears
caught
the
faint
sound
of
wheels
he
had
already
adjusted
the
crape
mask
he
had
brought
with
him
and
settled
his
chin
in
the
ample
folds
of
the
india
silk
muffler
he
had
tied
round
his
throat
he
now
set
his
hat
more
firmly
on
his
head
and
drew
a
pistol
from
its
holster
and
now
some
distance
down
the
road
there
shone
two
yellow
points
of
flame
as
they
might
be
the
eyes
of
some
wild
animal
shining
in
the
dark
they
were
the
lamps
of
the
coming
chaise
nearer
and
nearer
sounded
the
of
the
horses
on
the
hard
road
a
minute
more
and
the
whole
concern
had
passed
out
of
the
moonlight
into
the
gully
of
blackness
in
which
our
horseman
was
lurking
the
moment
for
action
had
come
three
strides
of
his
horse
brought
him
into
a
line
with
the
postilion
halt
or
you
are
a
dead
man
he
called
out
in
commanding
tones
as
he
held
a
pistol
to
the
man
head
and
at
once
the
horses
were
pulled
up
short
on
their
haunches
it
was
not
the
first
command
of
the
kind
that
postilion
had
been
called
upon
to
obey
the
highwayman
had
brought
no
lantern
with
him
he
knew
or
thought
he
knew
quite
well
who
the
occupant
of
the
chaise
was
he
could
just
discern
a
vague
figure
in
one
corner
and
now
in
no
uncertain
voice
came
the
formula
sacred
by
long
use
on
such
occasions
your
money
or
your
life
not
that
it
was
the
money
our
young
friend
was
risking
so
much
to
obtain
but
something
very
different
only
he
had
not
seen
his
way
at
the
moment
to
vary
the
customary
command
the
answer
was
a
flash
and
a
report
from
the
interior
of
the
chaise
and
the
same
instant
a
harsh
voice
yelled
out
drive
on
tim
and
be
damned
to
you
hardly
had
the
words
left
his
lips
before
the
lash
came
down
heavily
on
his
horses
and
the
chaise
sprang
forward
unused
to
such
surprises
the
young
man
horse
shied
violently
and
then
backed
towards
the
plantation
as
if
its
rider
had
lost
control
of
it
what
would
have
happened
next
there
is
no
telling
had
not
another
horse
and
rider
springing
from
nowhere
as
it
seemed
appeared
at
this
instant
on
the
scene
our
highwayman
his
hat
fallen
off
and
his
head
thrown
back
was
swaying
in
his
saddle
and
the
newcomer
was
only
just
in
time
to
grasp
him
round
the
waist
and
so
save
him
from
falling
a
few
seconds
later
he
gave
vent
to
a
low
whistle
expressive
of
an
amazement
almost
too
deep
for
words
by
the
lord
that
made
me
a
woman
was
his
whispered
ejaculation
chapter
ii
in
search
of
a
lodging
it
was
not
the
chaise
of
tew
but
of
sir
humphrey
button
which
the
young
highwayman
had
so
valorously
bidden
to
halt
at
the
last
moment
tew
had
been
accosted
by
an
old
friend
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
a
number
of
years
and
had
been
easily
persuaded
to
put
off
his
departure
for
another
hour
in
order
to
talk
over
bygone
days
and
discuss
a
jorum
or
two
of
punch
with
him
our
young
friend
was
not
long
in
coming
to
himself
and
mightily
surprised
and
discomposed
he
was
at
finding
his
waist
firmly
encircled
by
a
sinewy
arm
and
to
dimly
discern
a
pair
of
eyes
gazing
intently
into
his
own
his
head
was
reclining
on
the
shoulder
through
the
orifices
of
a
crape
mask
he
was
bareheaded
and
his
own
mask
had
come
unfastened
and
had
fallen
off
for
a
moment
or
two
he
felt
dazed
and
could
not
make
out
what
had
happened
to
him
then
in
a
flash
he
recalled
everything
with
a
quick
resentful
movement
he
drew
himself
away
from
the
stranger
clasp
and
set
his
back
as
stiff
as
a
ramrod
for
all
that
his
cheek
was
aflame
with
blushes
but
the
kindly
night
hid
them
thank
you
very
much
he
said
in
freezing
accents
but
i
am
all
right
now
i
was
never
taken
like
it
before
and
trust
i
never
shall
be
again
it
was
too
ridiculous
let
us
hope
that
you
were
more
startled
than
hurt
said
the
other
for
all
that
it
was
a
close
shave
with
that
he
swung
himself
off
his
horse
and
going
a
yard
or
two
down
the
road
he
picked
up
the
youngster
hat
and
mask
there
a
through
the
brim
he
remarked
as
he
handed
him
his
property
yes
a
very
close
shave
indeed
then
as
he
proceeded
to
remount
his
horse
he
added
with
a
mellow
laugh
if
an
old
professor
may
venture
an
opinion
you
are
a
prentice
hand
at
this
sort
of
business
yes
indeed
this
is
my
first
adventure
of
the
kind
and
i
am
quite
sure
it
will
be
my
last
if
you
are
under
the
impression
he
continued
with
a
touch
of
hauteur
which
seemed
to
become
him
naturally
that
the
object
of
my
adventure
was
merely
the
replenishing
of
my
pockets
by
the
emptying
of
those
of
somebody
else
you
were
never
more
mistaken
my
intent
was
not
money
or
jewels
but
to
obtain
possession
of
a
will
of
a
most
iniquitous
will
the
destruction
of
which
would
have
the
effect
of
righting
a
great
wrong
unhappily
my
attempt
has
failed
and
the
wrong
will
never
be
righted
i
mistook
my
man
the
traveller
in
the
chaise
was
not
the
person
i
was
expecting
has
doubtless
made
up
his
mind
to
stay
the
night
at
appleford
a
very
wise
resolve
on
his
part
considering
how
unsafe
the
highway
is
for
honest
folk
after
dark
retorted
the
elder
man
with
his
careless
laugh
but
tell
me
this
young
sir
even
if
you
had
succeeded
in
getting
possession
of
the
will
and
destroying
it
what
would
there
have
been
to
hinder
the
testator
from
having
a
fresh
one
drawn
up
in
precisely
similar
terms
merely
the
fact
that
he
is
given
up
by
the
doctors
and
that
in
the
event
of
the
first
will
having
been
destroyed
he
would
not
have
lived
to
have
a
second
one
drawn
up
and
signed
at
any
moment
he
may
breathe
his
last
possibly
he
is
dead
already
your
heroic
attempt
to
right
a
great
wrong
is
of
a
nature
to
appeal
to
every
generous
heart
such
being
the
case
it
will
not
perhaps
be
deemed
presumptuous
on
my
part
to
suggest
that
where
you
have
failed
it
is
just
possible
that
i
might
succeed
should
you
therefore
be
pleased
to
accept
of
my
services
i
beg
to
assure
you
that
they
are
yours
to
command
here
he
removed
his
hat
and
swept
the
youngster
a
low
bow
the
other
hesitated
for
a
few
moments
as
hardly
knowing
in
what
terms
to
reply
but
when
he
did
speak
it
was
with
no
lack
of
decision
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
thank
you
sir
for
your
offer
which
i
assure
you
i
appreciate
at
its
full
value
but
for
certain
reasons
which
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
explain
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
that
i
should
avail
myself
of
it
in
that
case
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
will
it
be
deemed
an
impertinence
on
my
part
if
i
ask
in
what
direction
you
are
now
bound
neither
of
them
had
noticed
a
huge
black
cloud
which
had
been
gradually
creeping
up
the
sky
and
which
at
this
moment
burst
in
a
deluge
of
rain
as
by
mutual
consent
the
two
men
who
had
so
strangely
come
together
pricked
up
their
horses
and
sought
such
shelter
as
the
plantation
afforded
from
the
downpour
then
said
the
younger
man
in
reply
to
the
other
question
what
i
am
anxious
to
do
is
to
find
my
way
into
the
whinbarrow
road
after
which
i
shall
manage
well
enough
do
you
know
the
way
to
it
from
here
no
more
than
a
dead
man
it
an
awkward
road
to
hit
on
after
dark
and
you
might
flounder
about
till
daybreak
without
finding
it
in
five
minutes
from
now
what
little
moonlight
there
left
will
be
swallowed
up
by
this
confounded
after
which
it
will
be
as
dark
as
the
nethermost
pit
on
such
a
night
for
you
a
stranger
to
attempt
to
find
the
whinbarrow
road
would
be
the
sheerest
madness
what
then
do
you
recommend
me
to
do
i
will
tell
you
not
more
than
three
miles
from
here
stands
a
lonely
house
among
the
moors
rockmount
by
name
its
owner
a
solitary
is
a
man
well
advanced
in
years
a
scholar
and
a
bookworm
but
although
leading
such
a
secluded
life
his
door
is
open
day
and
night
to
any
one
who
like
yourself
has
lost
his
way
or
who
craves
the
shelter
of
his
roof
on
any
account
whatever
to
rockmount
you
must
now
hie
you
and
put
ellerslie
hospitality
to
the
proof
that
you
will
not
do
so
in
vain
i
am
well
assured
i
know
the
way
and
will
gladly
guide
you
there
come
let
us
lose
no
more
time
this
cursed
rain
shows
no
signs
of
leaving
off
but
if
this
part
of
the
country
is
so
well
known
to
you
urged
the
other
why
not
direct
me
the
way
i
want
to
go
instead
of
pressing
me
and
at
this
hour
of
the
night
to
intrude
on
the
hospitality
of
a
stranger
there
are
two
if
not
more
very
sufficient
reasons
why
i
am
unable
to
oblige
you
in
this
matter
responded
the
other
dryly
in
the
first
place
i
could
not
direct
you
as
you
call
it
into
the
whinbarrow
road
on
such
a
night
as
this
no
directions
would
avail
you
i
should
have
to
lead
you
there
and
plant
the
nose
of
your
mare
straight
up
the
road
before
leaving
you
in
the
second
place
my
way
lies
in
an
opposite
direction
matters
of
moment
need
my
presence
elsewhere
and
before
the
first
cock
begins
to
crow
i
must
be
a
score
miles
from
here
as
if
to
bar
any
further
discussion
in
the
matter
he
took
hold
of
the
bridle
of
the
other
horse
and
leading
the
way
out
of
the
plantation
started
off
at
an
easy
canter
up
the
road
in
the
direction
taken
by
the
chaise
the
younger
man
offered
no
opposition
to
the
proceeding
he
seemed
little
more
than
a
boy
and
the
night
adventures
had
fluttered
his
nerves
to
go
wandering
about
in
the
hunting
for
a
road
that
was
wholly
strange
to
him
not
one
of
the
great
highways
which
he
could
hardly
have
missed
but
a
narrow
turnpike
which
had
nothing
to
distinguish
it
from
other
roads
was
more
than
he
was
prepared
to
do
he
felt
like
one
in
a
all
that
had
happened
during
the
last
hour
had
an
air
of
unreality
he
was
himself
and
yet
not
himself
business
seemed
to
separate
him
by
a
huge
gap
both
from
yesterday
and
his
will
was
in
a
state
of
partial
suspension
he
allowed
himself
to
be
led
blindly
forward
he
neither
knew
nor
greatly
cared
whither
before
long
they
turned
sharply
to
the
left
up
a
rutted
and
stony
which
apparently
led
right
into
the
heart
of
the
moors
here
they
could
only
go
slowly
trusting
in
a
great
measure
to
the
instinct
and
surefootedness
of
their
horses
the
highwayman
still
kept
hold
of
the
other
bridle
the
rain
had
in
some
measure
abated
and
a
rift
in
the
clouds
low
down
in
the
east
was
slowly
broadening
not
a
word
had
passed
between
them
since
they
left
the
plantation
but
now
as
if
the
silence
had
become
irksome
to
him
the
man
with
the
crape
mask
burst
into
song
his
voice
was
a
full
clear
baritone
oh
kiss
me
childe
lovel
she
breathes
in
his
ear
night
shadows
flee
fast
the
moon
drown
in
the
mere
he
turns
his
head
slowly
christ
what
i
see
a
demon
rides
with
me
shrieks
ellen
when
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
the
verse
he
drew
forth
his
tapped
it
opened
it
and
with
a
little
bow
proffered
it
to
his
companion
the
moon
had
come
out
again
dim
and
watery
by
this
time
and
they
were
now
enabled
to
see
each
other
so
far
as
outlines
and
movements
were
concerned
although
the
more
minute
points
of
each
appearance
were
still
to
some
extent
conjectural
oblige
replied
the
younger
man
but
is
an
acquirement
i
ought
perhaps
to
say
an
accomplishment
to
which
as
yet
i
can
not
lay
claim
and
in
so
far
my
education
may
be
said
to
be
incomplete
is
a
necessary
part
of
a
gentleman
curriculum
a
pinch
of
rappee
or
good
kendal
brown
serves
at
once
to
soothe
the
nerves
disperse
the
vapors
and
enliven
the
brain
but
you
are
young
yet
my
dear
sir
les
beaux
jours
de
la
jeunesse
and
with
luck
have
many
years
before
you
for
the
cultivation
of
a
habit
which
unlike
other
habits
i
could
name
the
older
you
grow
the
more
quiet
satisfaction
you
derive
from
the
practice
of
it
amid
the
straits
and
disappointments
of
life
when
his
fortunes
are
at
their
lowest
and
his
friends
have
fallen
one
by
one
away
many
a
man
draws
his
truest
consolation
from
his
you
speak
like
one
grown
old
both
in
years
and
experience
said
the
other
laughingly
he
was
recovering
his
and
the
failure
of
his
enterprise
notwithstanding
was
beginning
to
enjoy
the
adventure
for
the
adventure
sake
the
highwayman
gave
vent
to
an
audible
sigh
experience
keeps
a
dear
school
he
said
and
is
only
fools
who
fail
to
learn
at
it
and
so
for
a
time
they
rode
on
in
silence
then
said
the
younger
man
you
seem
to
know
your
way
hereabouts
pretty
well
the
home
of
my
youth
was
no
great
distance
away
and
as
a
lad
i
wandered
over
these
moors
and
fells
till
i
grew
to
know
them
as
one
might
say
by
heart
have
we
much
farther
to
go
may
i
ask
another
ten
minutes
will
bring
us
to
our
destination
with
that
he
proceeded
to
remove
his
mask
and
stuff
it
into
one
of
his
pockets
for
a
little
while
they
jogged
along
side
by
side
without
speaking
the
tract
of
country
they
were
traversing
was
wild
and
desolate
in
the
extreme
on
every
side
stretched
the
bare
swelling
moorland
bare
save
for
the
short
sparse
grass
and
the
mosses
which
grew
in
its
hollows
and
more
sheltered
places
but
left
naked
its
huge
ribs
and
bosses
of
granite
which
showed
through
the
surface
in
every
direction
and
seemed
to
crave
the
decent
burial
which
only
some
great
cataclysm
of
nature
could
give
them
here
and
there
at
wide
intervals
a
narrow
unwound
itself
like
a
dusky
ribbon
till
it
was
lost
in
the
distance
these
rude
had
been
in
use
for
more
centuries
than
history
or
tradition
knew
of
and
served
to
connect
one
outlying
hamlet
with
another
over
them
from
time
to
time
paced
great
droves
of
cattle
and
sheep
on
their
way
to
one
or
other
of
the
frequent
fairs
which
in
those
days
far
more
than
now
brought
the
together
and
formed
one
of
the
most
distinctive
features
of
english
rural
life
here
we
are
at
last
said
the
highwayman
as
an
indefinite
mass
of
black
buildings
loomed
vaguely
before
them
for
the
rain
was
over
and
gone
and
the
moon
was
again
shining
in
a
clear
sky
which
presently
as
they
drew
nearer
took
on
the
shape
of
a
long
low
house
with
a
roof
and
twisted
chimneys
and
having
a
group
of
detached
outbuildings
in
the
rear
as
they
reined
in
their
horses
a
few
yards
from
the
low
wall
which
enclosed
a
space
of
rank
and
untended
shrubbery
the
younger
horseman
saw
not
without
a
sense
of
misgiving
that
the
whole
front
of
the
house
was
in
darkness
not
the
faintest
glimmer
of
light
was
anywhere
visible
and
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
for
a
sense
of
night
and
darkness
was
upon
him
that
this
desolate
and
spot
is
any
one
home
it
is
the
home
of
as
i
have
already
remarked
how
far
away
is
ellerslie
nearest
neighbor
four
good
miles
as
the
crow
flies
but
he
is
a
recluse
and
a
student
and
the
loneliness
of
rockmount
was
probably
his
main
inducement
for
becoming
its
tenant
in
any
case
we
are
too
late
to
claim
his
hospitality
there
is
not
a
light
anywhere
visible
you
mean
that
there
none
to
be
seen
from
where
we
are
standing
retorted
the
highwayman
dryly
but
that
no
proof
abed
he
a
genuine
nightbird
and
often
does
not
go
to
roost
before
daybreak
so
busy
is
he
over
his
studies
of
one
kind
or
another
at
another
time
the
younger
man
might
have
wondered
how
his
companion
had
acquired
such
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
habits
of
the
recluse
of
rockmount
but
just
then
he
had
other
things
to
think
about
follow
me
said
the
highwayman
and
with
that
he
walked
his
horse
round
a
corner
of
the
house
to
where
a
large
bow
window
invisible
before
bulged
out
from
the
main
building
that
is
the
window
of
ellerslie
study
he
resumed
you
can
see
by
the
light
shining
through
the
circular
openings
at
the
top
of
the
shutters
that
he
is
still
at
work
that
may
be
rejoined
the
other
but
doubtless
all
his
household
are
asleep
long
ago
and
rather
than
disturb
ellerslie
himself
at
such
an
hour
i
would
what
a
fastidious
young
you
are
broke
in
the
elder
man
do
you
think
i
would
have
brought
you
here
if
there
had
been
nobody
but
to
the
fore
as
i
happen
to
know
his
old
manservant
never
on
any
account
goes
to
bed
before
his
master
him
we
shall
find
as
wide
awake
as
an
owl
at
midnight
follow
me
he
led
the
way
back
to
where
a
ramshackle
gate
merely
on
latch
gave
admittance
to
a
gravelled
path
which
led
up
to
a
small
in
front
of
the
house
on
reaching
which
at
the
instance
of
the
highwayman
they
both
dismounted
then
going
up
to
the
door
he
lifted
the
massive
knocker
and
struck
three
resounding
blows
with
it
slowly
one
after
the
other
after
which
going
back
to
his
companion
he
said
here
young
sir
we
must
part
but
not
i
trust
before
you
have
told
me
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
the
very
great
service
you
have
rendered
me
a
bitter
laugh
broke
from
the
other
my
real
name
he
said
is
that
of
a
broken
and
ruined
man
whom
the
world
already
has
forgotten
that
by
which
i
am
customarily
known
nowadays
is
captain
nightshade
at
your
service
the
younger
man
showed
no
trace
of
surprise
i
suspected
as
much
from
the
first
he
said
in
this
part
of
the
country
only
one
of
the
road
does
us
the
honor
of
taking
toll
of
us
the
rest
are
scum
mere
vulgar
ruffians
ripe
for
the
sir
you
flatter
me
with
a
grave
inclination
of
the
head
may
i
in
my
turn
if
it
be
not
deemed
an
impertinence
ask
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
an
hour
of
the
pleasantest
companionship
it
has
been
my
good
fortune
to
enjoy
for
many
a
long
day
name
hum
i
must
consider
by
the
way
you
remarked
a
little
while
ago
and
very
truly
that
as
far
as
your
profession
was
concerned
i
was
a
prentice
hand
suppose
then
that
you
call
me
jack
prentice
serve
as
well
as
another
jack
prentice
let
it
be
with
all
my
heart
is
a
name
i
shall
not
forget
ah
here
comes
somebody
in
answer
to
my
summons
and
indeed
there
was
a
noise
as
of
the
undoing
of
the
bolts
and
bars
of
the
massive
door
which
a
few
seconds
later
was
opened
wide
disclosing
a
in
a
faded
livery
who
stood
there
staring
into
the
darkness
shielding
with
one
hand
a
lighted
candle
which
he
carried
in
the
other
captain
nightshade
strode
up
to
the
door
and
in
his
easy
way
said
you
are
one
of
ellerslie
servants
i
presume
i
be
answered
the
old
man
laconically
then
be
good
enough
to
present
my
compliments
to
your
master
the
compliments
of
a
neighbor
hem
and
tell
him
there
a
young
gentleman
at
the
door
who
has
been
belated
on
the
moors
and
craves
the
hospitality
of
rockmount
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
jack
prentice
had
followed
close
on
the
captain
heels
and
as
the
candlelight
shone
full
on
the
latter
face
he
had
now
for
the
first
time
an
opportunity
of
seeing
what
the
noted
highwayman
was
like
what
he
saw
was
a
long
lean
brown
face
the
face
of
an
ascetic
it
might
almost
have
been
termed
had
it
not
been
contradicted
by
a
pair
of
black
penetrating
eyes
of
extraordinary
brilliancy
and
by
a
mobile
changeable
mouth
which
rarely
wore
the
same
expression
for
three
minutes
at
a
time
his
rounded
massive
chin
seemed
a
little
out
of
keeping
with
the
rest
of
his
features
as
though
it
belonged
of
right
to
another
type
of
face
his
high
nose
thin
and
curved
with
its
fine
nostrils
lent
him
an
air
of
breeding
and
distinction
in
figure
he
was
tall
and
sinewy
his
black
hair
tied
into
a
queue
not
more
than
half
the
size
of
his
companion
showed
no
trace
of
powder
his
prevailing
expression
might
be
said
to
be
one
of
almost
defiant
recklessness
mingled
with
a
sort
of
cynical
it
was
as
though
into
an
originally
noble
nature
a
drop
of
subtle
poison
had
been
distilled
which
had
served
to
muddy
and
discolor
it
so
that
it
no
longer
reflected
things
in
their
true
proportions
without
having
been
able
to
more
than
partially
corrupt
it
the
old
lips
worked
as
though
he
were
mumbling
over
the
message
with
which
he
had
been
charged
then
with
a
curt
nod
he
turned
away
and
putting
down
his
candlestick
on
a
side
table
was
presently
lost
to
view
in
the
gloom
of
the
corridor
beyond
the
if
captain
nightshade
had
any
consciousness
of
the
brief
but
keen
scrutiny
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
he
failed
to
betray
it
while
they
were
awaiting
the
man
return
he
slowly
paced
the
gravelled
sweep
singing
in
a
low
voice
a
snatch
of
a
ditty
the
last
line
of
which
had
something
to
do
with
ruby
wine
and
laughing
eyes
then
the
came
back
the
master
bids
yo
welcome
he
said
there
supper
bed
and
breakfast
at
yore
sarvice
he
busy
just
now
but
mayhap
he
find
time
to
see
yo
for
a
few
minutes
by
an
by
i
felt
assured
you
would
not
claim
the
hospitality
of
rockmount
in
vain
said
captain
nightshade
and
now
my
dear
prentice
i
must
wish
you
a
very
goodnight
coupled
with
the
hope
that
sound
sleep
and
pleasant
dreams
will
be
yours
i
have
a
presentiment
that
we
have
not
seen
the
last
of
each
other
and
my
presentiments
generally
come
true
he
would
have
turned
away
but
the
other
held
out
his
hand
i
am
your
debtor
for
much
this
night
he
said
you
say
you
have
a
presentiment
that
we
shall
meet
again
when
that
time
comes
i
may
perhaps
be
able
to
repay
you
at
present
is
out
of
my
power
to
do
so
their
hands
met
for
a
moment
and
parted
and
each
bowed
ceremoniously
to
the
other
then
captain
nightshade
climbed
lightly
into
his
saddle
waved
his
hand
gave
rein
to
his
horse
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
the
same
instant
a
second
servant
appeared
from
somewhere
and
taking
charge
of
prentice
horse
led
it
away
towards
the
rear
of
the
house
then
with
such
a
throb
of
the
heart
as
one
experiences
on
stepping
across
the
threshold
of
the
unknown
doubtful
of
what
one
may
find
on
the
other
side
our
young
gentleman
stepped
across
the
threshold
of
rockmount
and
heard
the
bolts
and
bars
of
the
great
door
shot
one
by
one
behind
him
chapter
iii
ellerslie
of
rockmount
having
resumed
possession
of
his
candlestick
the
old
whose
face
wore
a
sour
and
suspicious
look
beckoned
jack
and
leading
the
way
presently
threw
open
a
door
at
the
end
of
a
corridor
and
ushered
him
into
a
spacious
panelled
room
in
the
grate
of
which
a
cosy
fire
was
burning
supper
bein
got
ready
sir
and
will
be
served
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
said
the
man
and
with
that
he
lighted
a
couple
of
wax
candles
on
the
centre
table
and
two
more
over
the
then
he
stirred
up
the
fire
to
a
blaze
and
hobbled
out
of
the
room
without
a
word
more
jack
first
action
was
to
relieve
himself
of
his
sodden
cloak
which
he
laid
over
the
back
of
a
chair
that
done
he
spread
his
chilled
fingers
to
the
blaze
and
proceeded
to
take
stock
of
his
surroundings
this
was
soon
done
for
the
room
held
nothing
calculated
to
arrest
his
attention
or
excite
his
curiosity
it
was
sparsely
furnished
and
its
few
chairs
and
tables
together
with
the
bureau
in
one
corner
although
of
choice
workmanship
were
all
venerable
with
age
carpet
and
hearthrug
alike
were
faded
and
in
places
worn
threadbare
of
pictures
or
ornaments
of
any
kind
except
for
a
small
malachite
vase
on
the
the
room
was
wholly
destitute
judging
from
appearances
it
seemed
clear
that
the
master
of
rockmount
was
not
a
wealthy
man
scarcely
had
jack
concluded
his
survey
before
the
door
was
opened
and
in
came
a
woman
carrying
a
which
she
proceeded
to
deposit
on
a
centre
table
and
then
wheeled
the
latter
nearer
the
fire
the
tray
proved
to
contain
a
cold
fowl
some
slices
of
ham
butter
cheese
bread
and
a
bottle
of
claret
to
our
young
friend
ravenously
hungry
and
chilled
to
the
marrow
it
seemed
a
supper
fit
for
the
gods
will
you
please
to
ring
sir
when
you
are
ready
for
your
coffee
said
the
woman
and
then
he
was
left
alone
not
till
half
an
hour
had
gone
by
did
he
ring
the
bell
by
which
time
his
spirits
had
gone
up
several
degrees
intensely
chagrined
though
he
was
by
his
failure
to
secure
that
for
which
he
had
risked
so
much
there
was
a
relish
about
his
adventure
which
he
appreciated
to
the
full
which
appealed
at
once
to
his
imagination
and
to
the
unconventional
side
of
a
character
which
had
often
vainly
beat
itself
against
the
restrictions
and
restraints
by
which
it
was
environed
he
felt
that
was
a
night
to
have
lived
for
it
would
dwell
freshly
in
his
memory
to
the
last
day
of
his
life
for
the
space
of
one
hour
and
a
half
he
had
been
with
captain
nightshade
the
most
redoubtable
highwayman
in
all
the
north
country
and
if
some
people
might
think
that
was
nothing
to
be
proud
of
it
was
at
any
rate
something
to
remember
whether
he
was
proud
of
it
or
no
he
was
conscious
of
a
secret
sense
of
elation
into
the
origin
of
which
he
had
no
wish
to
inquire
he
only
knew
that
he
would
not
have
foregone
the
night
experiences
for
a
great
deal
but
the
night
was
not
yet
over
although
there
seemed
to
be
some
danger
of
his
forgetting
that
fact
so
busy
were
his
thoughts
with
the
events
of
the
last
couple
of
hours
however
the
bringing
in
of
his
coffee
served
to
break
up
his
reverie
and
he
began
to
wonder
whether
he
was
destined
to
see
his
unknown
host
he
was
not
left
long
in
doubt
ellerslie
sir
will
do
himself
the
pleasure
of
waiting
upon
you
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
said
the
woman
together
with
the
coffee
she
had
brought
in
a
case
of
spirits
with
the
needful
concomitants
for
the
manufacture
of
grog
without
a
tumbler
or
two
of
which
by
way
of
nightcap
our
rarely
thought
of
wending
their
way
bedward
while
the
woman
cleared
the
table
jack
went
back
to
his
chair
near
the
fire
the
blaze
as
he
bent
towards
it
in
musing
mood
resting
an
elbow
on
either
knee
lighted
up
a
face
that
was
very
pleasant
to
look
upon
in
shape
it
was
a
rather
long
oval
the
cheeks
as
smooth
and
rounded
as
those
of
a
girl
of
twenty
with
that
pure
healthy
tint
in
them
which
nothing
but
plenty
of
exposure
to
sun
and
wind
can
impart
indeed
if
you
had
looked
closely
you
would
have
seen
that
here
and
there
they
were
slightly
freckled
add
to
this
a
nose
of
the
grecian
type
long
and
straight
and
a
short
upper
lip
with
a
marked
cleft
in
it
his
hair
which
was
brushed
straight
back
from
his
forehead
so
as
to
help
in
the
formation
of
his
queue
was
of
the
color
of
filberts
when
at
their
ripest
with
here
and
there
a
gleam
of
dead
gold
in
it
his
large
eyes
were
of
the
deepest
shade
of
hazel
heavily
lashed
and
with
a
wonderful
velvety
softness
in
them
which
when
he
was
at
all
excited
would
glow
and
kindle
with
a
sort
of
inner
flame
or
if
his
temper
were
roused
which
it
easily
was
would
flash
with
scornful
lightnings
while
the
line
between
his
brows
deepened
to
a
veritable
furrow
for
truth
to
tell
jack
prentice
was
of
a
quick
and
somewhat
fiery
disposition
a
little
too
ready
perhaps
to
take
offence
with
an
intense
hatred
for
every
kind
of
injustice
and
a
fine
scorn
for
the
little
meannesses
and
subterfuges
of
everyday
life
the
practice
of
which
with
many
of
us
is
so
habitual
and
that
we
no
longer
recognize
them
for
what
they
really
are
but
if
master
jack
was
a
little
too
ready
so
to
speak
to
clap
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
rapier
he
never
bore
any
his
temper
would
flare
out
and
be
done
with
it
with
the
suddenness
of
a
summer
storm
which
has
come
and
gone
and
given
you
a
taste
of
its
quality
almost
before
you
know
what
has
happened
but
we
shall
know
more
of
jack
generous
loyal
and
before
we
have
done
with
him
the
door
opened
and
came
in
his
guest
stood
up
and
turned
to
receive
him
the
master
of
rockmount
was
a
tall
thin
elderly
man
apparently
about
sixty
years
old
with
a
pronounced
stoop
of
the
shoulders
his
outer
garment
was
a
dark
heavy
robe
or
gaberdine
which
wrapped
him
from
throat
to
ankle
his
long
grizzled
hair
parted
down
the
middle
fell
on
either
side
over
his
ears
and
rested
on
the
collar
of
his
robe
the
crown
of
his
head
was
covered
with
a
small
velvet
skull
cap
he
wore
a
short
vandyck
beard
and
moustache
which
like
his
prominent
eyebrows
were
thickly
flecked
with
gray
for
the
rest
his
face
when
seen
from
a
little
distance
looked
like
nothing
so
much
as
a
mask
carved
out
of
ivory
with
the
yellow
tint
of
age
upon
it
but
when
a
little
later
jack
was
enabled
to
view
it
close
at
hand
it
was
seen
to
be
marked
and
lined
with
thousands
of
extremely
fine
and
minute
creases
and
wrinkles
as
it
might
be
the
face
of
a
man
centuries
old
but
there
was
nothing
old
about
the
eyes
which
were
very
bright
and
of
a
singularly
penetrative
quality
jack
started
involuntarily
when
his
own
traversed
them
of
whose
eyes
did
they
remind
him
when
and
where
had
he
seen
that
look
before
was
it
in
some
dream
which
he
had
forgotten
till
they
supplied
the
missing
link
if
so
all
else
had
escaped
him
hardly
however
had
he
time
to
ask
himself
these
questions
before
his
host
advancing
with
a
grave
inclination
of
the
head
said
welcome
to
rockmount
young
gentleman
i
am
happy
to
be
in
a
position
to
extend
to
you
the
hospitality
of
my
humble
roof
you
are
neither
the
first
nor
the
second
who
having
lost
his
bearings
in
this
remote
district
has
found
shelter
here
you
were
fortunate
in
there
being
no
fog
at
such
times
to
be
lost
on
the
moors
is
not
merely
unpleasant
but
dangerous
i
am
sorry
my
people
were
not
prepared
to
put
before
you
fare
of
a
more
kind
but
we
are
very
isolated
here
as
you
may
imagine
and
so
few
are
my
visitors
that
it
would
be
folly
to
prepare
for
people
who
might
never
come
for
my
own
part
i
may
add
that
i
am
no
sybarite
there
was
a
peculiarly
hollow
ring
about
ellerslie
voice
as
though
it
reached
one
from
out
of
the
depths
of
a
cavern
and
yet
it
seemed
to
his
guest
as
if
there
was
a
note
of
in
it
as
if
he
had
heard
it
somewhere
before
it
might
be
long
ago
but
that
of
course
was
absurd
while
speaking
ellerslie
had
advanced
to
the
fire
and
motioning
his
guest
to
resume
his
seat
had
himself
taken
possession
of
a
chair
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hearth
then
master
jack
made
haste
to
express
his
gratitude
for
the
hospitality
so
generously
extended
to
him
very
prettily
turned
young
gentleman
said
ellerslie
with
a
nod
of
approval
when
he
had
come
to
an
end
you
have
good
choice
of
words
and
express
yourself
without
any
trace
of
that
affectation
which
nowadays
mars
the
speech
of
so
many
of
our
bucks
and
young
men
of
the
blush
of
ingenuous
youth
mantled
in
jack
cheeks
for
a
moment
or
two
he
could
not
help
noticing
and
in
it
was
a
point
which
often
recurred
to
him
that
his
host
never
smiled
that
no
flitting
shade
of
expression
ever
changed
the
bloodless
features
they
remained
wholly
unmoved
in
their
set
waxen
pallor
and
now
resumed
ellerslie
will
there
be
any
impropriety
in
my
asking
my
guest
to
favor
me
with
his
name
but
if
for
any
reason
whatever
he
would
prefer
to
remain
incognito
he
has
merely
to
intimate
as
much
and
his
reticence
will
be
duly
respected
jack
was
prepared
for
the
question
and
he
answered
it
without
hesitation
if
ellerslie
we
should
ever
meet
in
as
i
sincerely
trust
we
may
and
you
should
accost
me
by
the
name
of
frank
nevill
you
will
find
me
answer
to
it
it
is
a
name
i
promise
not
to
forget
you
seem
to
have
got
name
quite
pat
mr
nevill
nevill
or
prentice
or
whatever
his
real
name
was
laughed
a
little
uneasily
it
was
from
the
er
gentleman
who
acted
as
my
guide
and
brought
me
here
that
i
learnt
it
how
you
learnt
it
my
dear
sir
is
a
matter
of
no
moment
so
long
as
you
know
it
but
i
am
forgetting
that
the
grog
is
waiting
to
be
mixed
you
will
join
me
over
a
tumbler
of
course
but
this
his
guest
politely
but
firmly
declined
doing
ellerslie
was
careful
not
to
press
him
farther
than
good
breeding
sanctioned
which
however
did
not
hinder
him
from
mixing
a
stiff
and
steaming
tumbler
for
himself
having
tasted
it
and
apparently
found
it
to
his
liking
he
went
back
to
his
seat
by
the
fire
you
were
good
enough
just
now
nevill
to
express
a
hope
that
you
and
i
might
some
day
meet
again
such
a
meeting
although
not
beyond
the
bounds
of
possibility
as
indeed
in
this
world
what
is
hardly
comes
within
the
range
of
likelihood
you
are
just
on
the
point
of
stepping
into
the
arena
the
struggle
the
turmoil
the
dust
the
elation
of
victory
or
it
may
be
the
bitterness
of
defeat
lie
still
before
you
while
for
me
it
is
all
over
i
have
come
out
of
the
fight
with
reversed
arms
i
have
left
the
sweating
crowd
and
its
plaudits
plaudits
never
showered
upon
me
behind
me
forever
here
in
this
rude
hermitage
somewhat
bleak
of
a
truth
in
winter
time
i
hope
to
pass
the
remainder
of
my
days
as
pope
so
aptly
expresses
it
world
forgetting
by
the
world
forgot
therefore
my
dear
nevill
the
chances
are
that
after
you
and
i
are
hardly
likely
to
meet
again
to
you
belong
the
golden
possibilities
of
the
future
to
me
nothing
but
memories
he
stirred
his
grog
took
a
good
pull
at
it
and
then
went
on
with
his
monologue
rockmount
has
now
been
my
home
for
a
couple
of
years
and
i
have
no
desire
to
leave
it
here
i
live
in
the
utmost
seclusion
with
my
books
and
a
few
scientific
instruments
an
act
of
the
blackest
treachery
drove
me
from
the
world
a
ruined
man
bankrupt
in
hope
in
friendship
in
means
with
not
one
illusion
left
of
all
those
with
which
but
i
weary
you
with
my
egotistic
maunderings
besides
the
hour
is
late
i
can
not
expect
you
to
be
such
a
as
i
am
and
doubtless
you
are
hungering
for
your
bed
nevill
protested
a
little
mendaciously
that
he
was
not
at
all
tired
tired
he
was
but
not
sleepy
he
would
willingly
have
sat
out
the
rest
of
the
night
with
his
singular
host
presently
ellerslie
having
finished
the
remainder
of
his
grog
said
by
the
way
towards
which
point
of
the
compass
are
you
desirous
of
bending
your
steps
in
the
morning
if
i
could
only
find
my
way
to
the
whinbarrow
road
i
should
know
where
i
was
one
of
my
fellows
shall
go
with
you
and
not
leave
you
till
he
has
put
you
into
it
you
have
but
to
name
your
own
hour
for
breakfast
and
dobson
will
have
it
ready
for
you
he
rose
as
intimating
that
the
moment
for
retiring
had
come
a
light
was
burning
in
the
and
two
had
been
placed
in
readiness
one
of
which
ellerslie
proceeded
to
light
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
held
out
his
hand
it
was
a
long
lean
sinewy
hand
nevill
could
not
help
noticing
and
not
at
all
like
that
of
a
man
on
whom
age
had
in
other
respects
set
its
unmistakable
seal
i
am
one
of
those
mortals
who
have
an
uncomfortable
habit
of
turning
night
into
day
remarked
the
elder
man
as
he
clasped
his
fingers
i
usually
sit
up
till
dawn
is
in
the
sky
and
as
a
consequence
i
sleep
till
late
in
the
forenoon
as
you
tell
me
that
you
want
to
be
on
your
way
at
an
early
hour
i
had
better
perhaps
say
both
goodnight
and
goodbye
here
and
now
ah
a
mouse
frank
nevill
gave
a
backward
spring
and
a
little
frightened
cry
escaped
his
lips
next
moment
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
and
he
felt
as
if
he
could
have
bitten
his
tongue
out
for
betraying
him
as
it
had
but
ellerslie
seemed
to
have
noticed
nothing
we
have
not
many
such
vermin
i
am
happy
to
say
he
resumed
after
a
momentary
pause
but
these
old
country
houses
are
seldom
altogether
free
of
them
and
so
presently
they
parted
dobson
was
awaiting
nevill
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
your
room
sir
is
the
third
door
on
the
left
down
the
corridor
she
said
at
what
hour
would
you
be
pleased
to
like
breakfast
will
eight
be
too
early
no
hour
you
may
name
will
be
either
too
early
or
too
late
sir
then
eight
let
it
be
thereupon
the
woman
curtsied
wished
him
a
respectful
goodnight
and
left
him
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
in
the
room
indicated
and
with
the
door
not
merely
shut
but
locked
he
sat
down
with
an
air
of
weariness
almost
of
despondency
body
and
brain
were
alike
tired
out
yet
never
had
he
felt
more
wakeful
than
at
that
moment
even
had
he
been
in
the
habit
of
trying
to
analyze
his
emotions
which
he
certainly
was
not
the
effort
to
do
so
would
have
puzzled
him
just
then
the
bitter
consciousness
that
he
had
failed
in
the
endeavor
for
which
he
had
risked
so
much
was
always
with
him
lurking
as
it
were
in
the
background
of
his
brain
he
felt
it
like
a
dull
persistent
ache
which
never
quite
let
go
its
hold
of
him
whatever
other
subject
might
be
occupying
the
forefront
of
his
thoughts
and
then
there
were
all
the
other
events
of
the
day
just
ended
which
he
started
to
his
feet
i
shall
have
and
a
hundred
in
which
i
shall
have
nothing
to
do
but
think
and
think
and
think
if
i
begin
the
process
i
shall
not
sleep
a
wink
as
yet
he
had
given
neither
a
thought
nor
a
glance
to
the
room
but
he
now
began
to
look
about
him
with
a
little
natural
curiosity
it
was
a
somewhat
gloomy
chamber
the
walls
having
been
originally
painted
a
dull
chocolate
color
which
had
not
improved
with
the
passage
of
time
in
one
corner
was
a
large
bed
with
furniture
of
dark
moreen
the
of
black
oak
was
crowded
with
an
assortment
of
toilet
requirements
and
appurtenances
and
of
most
elegant
workmanship
then
his
wandering
glances
were
arrested
by
something
a
garment
of
snowy
whiteness
which
had
been
laid
over
the
back
of
a
chair
nevill
crossing
to
it
took
it
up
gingerly
and
opened
it
it
proved
to
be
a
fine
lawn
de
frilled
and
trimmed
with
beautiful
lace
a
garment
such
as
a
duchess
might
have
worn
but
certainly
never
intended
to
be
worn
by
one
of
the
opposite
sex
our
young
friend
dropped
it
as
if
it
were
a
cinder
and
sinking
into
the
nearest
chair
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
from
head
to
foot
he
felt
as
if
he
were
one
huge
blush
chapter
iv
the
squire
of
stanbrook
before
proceeding
to
narrate
the
sequel
of
the
strange
adventure
of
the
frank
nevill
it
may
be
as
well
that
the
reader
should
be
made
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
to
which
was
owing
his
appearance
on
the
king
highway
in
the
character
of
an
amateur
claude
duval
at
the
time
with
which
our
narrative
has
to
do
ambrose
cortelyon
commonly
known
as
squire
cortelyon
of
stanbrook
an
old
family
seat
in
one
of
the
most
northern
counties
of
england
was
well
over
his
seventieth
birthday
thrown
by
his
horse
more
than
twenty
years
before
he
had
not
only
broken
his
leg
but
three
or
four
of
his
ribs
into
the
bargain
surgical
science
in
those
days
especially
in
country
places
was
not
what
it
is
now
his
leg
was
badly
set
with
the
result
that
from
that
time
he
had
been
a
partial
cripple
who
when
he
walked
any
distance
alone
had
to
do
so
with
the
help
of
a
couple
of
stout
sticks
but
who
usually
preferred
the
arm
of
his
factotum
andry
luce
and
one
stick
andry
of
whom
we
shall
hear
more
later
was
a
man
of
forty
with
a
big
shaggy
head
and
the
torso
of
an
athlete
set
on
the
short
bowed
legs
of
a
dwarf
further
he
was
dumb
the
result
of
a
fright
when
a
child
a
deficiency
which
only
caused
his
employer
to
value
him
the
more
he
was
clever
with
his
pen
and
at
figures
and
kept
the
accounts
and
wrote
most
of
his
letters
for
cortelyon
hated
pen
work
and
besides
suffered
occasionally
from
gout
in
his
fingers
finally
andry
filled
up
his
spare
time
by
dabbling
in
chemistry
in
an
amateurish
fashion
being
quite
content
to
experiment
on
the
discoveries
of
others
and
having
no
ambition
to
adventure
on
any
of
his
own
a
oil
painting
of
squire
cortelyon
taken
a
short
time
before
his
accident
and
still
in
existence
represents
him
as
a
thin
man
of
medium
height
close
shaven
with
a
long
narrow
face
a
handsome
face
with
its
regular
features
most
people
would
call
it
cold
unsympathetic
eyes
and
a
dry
caustic
smile
his
dark
unpowdered
hair
cut
short
in
front
is
doubtless
gathered
into
a
queue
only
as
he
stands
facing
the
spectator
the
picture
fails
to
show
it
he
is
dressed
in
a
coat
with
gilt
buttons
his
waistcoat
is
of
white
satin
elaborately
embroidered
with
sprays
of
flowers
his
and
of
some
dark
woven
material
reach
to
the
ankle
where
they
are
tied
with
a
knot
of
ribbon
and
are
supplemented
by
white
silk
stockings
and
buckled
shoes
round
his
throat
is
wound
a
soft
cravat
of
many
folds
his
shirt
is
frilled
and
he
wears
lace
ruffles
at
his
wrists
he
stands
in
an
easy
and
not
ungraceful
posture
looking
right
into
the
spectator
eyes
in
one
hand
he
clasps
his
deprived
of
which
life
for
him
would
have
lost
half
its
value
although
squire
cortelyon
courted
and
loved
a
cheap
popularity
at
heart
he
was
a
man
of
a
hard
and
griping
disposition
whose
chief
object
in
life
more
especially
of
late
years
had
been
the
accumulation
of
wealth
in
the
shape
of
landed
property
even
in
early
life
he
had
never
either
hunted
or
shot
but
for
all
that
he
subscribed
liberally
to
the
nearest
pack
of
hounds
as
also
but
less
liberally
to
the
usual
local
charities
although
he
employed
a
couple
of
keepers
he
did
not
preserve
too
strictly
a
fact
which
tended
to
his
popularity
among
his
poorer
neighbors
while
having
an
opposite
effect
among
those
of
his
own
standing
in
the
county
in
point
of
fact
of
the
game
on
his
estates
was
shot
by
his
keepers
and
sent
under
his
direction
for
sale
to
the
nearest
large
town
when
ambrose
cortelyon
at
the
age
of
came
into
his
patrimony
it
was
not
only
grievously
burdened
with
debt
but
as
far
as
mere
acreage
was
concerned
owing
to
extravagant
living
on
the
part
of
his
two
immediate
progenitors
had
dwindled
to
little
more
than
a
third
of
what
it
had
been
sixty
years
before
from
the
first
the
new
squire
made
up
his
mind
that
the
follies
of
his
father
and
grandfather
should
not
be
repeated
in
his
case
from
the
first
he
set
two
objects
definitely
before
him
and
never
allowed
himself
to
lose
sight
of
them
object
number
one
was
to
wipe
off
the
burden
of
debt
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
this
by
the
practice
of
rigid
economy
he
was
enabled
to
do
in
the
course
of
eight
or
ten
years
after
which
he
began
to
save
object
number
two
was
to
become
in
the
course
of
time
a
large
landowner
even
as
his
and
his
more
remote
ancestors
right
away
back
to
the
sixteenth
century
had
been
thus
in
the
course
of
time
it
came
to
pass
that
ambrose
cortelyon
had
become
the
owner
of
sundry
considerable
properties
not
all
of
them
situated
in
his
own
county
but
none
of
them
farther
off
than
a
day
ride
which
owing
to
one
cause
or
another
had
come
into
the
market
every
season
and
what
was
true
then
seems
equally
true
brought
its
own
little
crop
of
landed
proprietors
who
owing
to
improvidence
or
misfortune
or
both
had
fallen
upon
evil
days
and
whenever
there
was
a
likely
property
in
the
neighborhood
to
be
had
a
bargain
the
squire
or
his
agent
piljoy
was
always
to
the
fore
with
the
former
it
was
an
article
of
faith
that
for
one
reason
or
other
landed
property
would
rise
greatly
in
value
in
the
course
of
the
next
generation
or
two
and
so
constitute
a
stable
inheritance
for
those
to
come
after
him
in
so
believing
the
prescience
with
which
he
credited
himself
was
undoubtedly
at
fault
many
things
were
to
happen
during
the
next
of
which
not
even
the
most
of
the
statesmen
of
those
days
had
the
slightest
prevision
squire
cortelyon
was
turned
forty
before
he
married
he
fixed
his
mature
affections
on
a
banker
daughter
who
brought
him
a
dowry
of
ten
thousand
pounds
with
the
prospect
of
thirty
thousand
to
follow
at
her
father
demise
but
three
years
later
the
bank
in
which
lowthian
was
senior
partner
failed
and
the
prospective
thirty
thousand
went
in
the
general
smash
such
a
loss
to
such
a
man
was
undoubtedly
a
terrible
blow
a
couple
of
years
later
still
his
wife
died
leaving
him
with
one
child
a
son
he
had
felt
no
particular
affection
for
her
while
living
and
he
was
not
hypocrite
enough
to
pretend
to
mourn
her
very
deeply
now
she
was
dead
ambrose
cortelyon
was
one
of
those
men
who
never
feel
comfortable
or
at
home
in
the
presence
of
children
and
as
soon
as
master
dick
was
old
enough
he
was
packed
off
to
a
public
school
and
for
the
next
dozen
or
more
years
except
at
holiday
times
it
was
but
little
he
saw
either
of
his
father
or
his
home
from
school
he
went
to
college
but
with
his
birthday
his
career
at
cambridge
came
to
an
end
the
life
his
father
intended
him
for
was
that
of
a
country
gentleman
with
perhaps
an
where
then
would
have
been
the
use
of
wasting
more
time
in
competing
for
a
degree
which
even
if
he
should
succeed
in
taking
it
would
be
of
no
to
him
far
better
that
he
should
spend
a
season
or
two
in
town
perfecting
himself
in
his
french
meanwhile
the
country
swarmed
with
glad
to
give
lessons
for
the
merest
pittance
and
after
that
devote
a
couple
of
years
to
the
grand
tour
cortelyon
would
have
his
son
a
man
of
the
world
and
neither
a
milksop
nor
a
puritan
with
his
own
hands
he
put
a
copy
of
lord
chesterfield
letters
to
his
son
into
dick
valise
a
book
to
profit
by
he
said
let
me
adjure
you
to
read
and
it
dick
felt
more
respect
which
till
he
was
had
not
been
unmixed
with
awe
than
affection
for
his
father
all
his
life
cortelyon
had
been
a
reserved
and
undemonstrative
man
and
averse
from
any
display
of
feeling
or
sentiment
still
that
his
son
was
far
dearer
to
him
than
aught
else
in
life
and
that
he
looked
with
secret
pride
and
hope
to
moulding
him
in
accordance
with
his
own
views
and
wishes
can
hardly
be
doubted
the
mistake
he
made
was
in
imagining
that
dick
was
fashioned
on
the
same
lines
mental
and
moral
as
himself
whereas
the
lad
took
after
his
mother
in
almost
every
particular
affable
to
all
led
far
more
by
his
heart
than
his
head
everybody
friend
and
nobody
enemy
but
his
own
how
was
such
a
young
man
with
his
handsome
person
purse
and
a
certain
element
of
rustic
simplicity
which
still
clung
to
him
to
escape
shipwreck
in
the
great
maelstrom
of
london
in
one
form
or
another
at
any
rate
dick
cortelyon
did
not
escape
shipwreck
in
so
far
as
the
utter
ruin
of
his
worldly
prospects
was
concerned
he
had
not
been
a
year
in
town
before
he
committed
the
unpardonable
folly
unpardonable
in
the
only
son
of
squire
cortelyon
of
marrying
a
fascinating
little
actress
of
no
particular
ability
who
at
that
time
was
playing
chambermaid
parts
at
one
of
the
patent
theatres
for
a
remuneration
of
a
guinea
a
week
the
marriage
was
kept
by
dick
a
profound
secret
both
from
his
father
and
his
friends
but
it
had
to
be
told
the
former
when
some
months
later
he
summoned
dick
home
on
purpose
to
inform
him
that
it
was
his
wish
really
tantamount
to
a
command
on
the
part
of
such
a
man
that
he
should
make
up
to
miss
onoria
flood
the
only
daughter
of
a
neighbor
and
do
his
best
to
secure
her
before
any
other
suitor
appeared
on
the
scene
when
the
fatal
news
was
broken
to
the
squire
he
bundled
master
dick
out
of
doors
without
a
moment
hesitation
there
and
then
he
took
an
oath
that
he
would
never
forgive
him
nor
ever
set
eyes
on
him
again
and
he
was
a
man
who
prided
himself
on
keeping
his
word
at
once
he
stopped
dick
allowance
some
few
years
before
these
things
came
to
pass
the
granddaughter
of
his
sister
agatha
an
orphan
left
without
means
beyond
a
narrow
pittance
of
eighty
pounds
a
year
had
come
to
live
at
stanbrook
no
other
home
being
open
to
her
although
there
was
a
difference
of
some
six
years
in
their
ages
and
although
they
had
only
met
at
intervals
they
had
been
to
each
other
like
elder
brother
and
younger
sister
from
the
first
miss
baynard
had
conceived
an
almost
passionate
liking
and
admiration
for
her
handsome
kinsman
and
now
that
poor
dick
was
leaving
home
never
to
return
she
contrived
to
have
a
stolen
interview
with
him
before
he
went
although
only
just
turned
sixteen
she
was
in
many
things
wise
beyond
her
years
and
before
parting
from
dick
she
obtained
from
him
an
address
at
which
he
told
her
a
letter
would
at
any
time
find
him
not
being
sure
what
his
future
movements
might
be
he
gave
her
the
address
of
his
wife
uncle
who
kept
a
tobacconist
shop
in
a
street
off
holborn
that
done
dick
kissed
her
and
went
and
with
his
going
half
the
sunshine
seemed
to
vanish
out
of
nell
life
at
once
dick
cortelyon
broke
with
his
old
life
and
all
its
associations
the
fashionable
world
knew
him
no
more
he
disappeared
he
went
under
he
took
a
couple
of
furnished
rooms
in
an
obscure
neighborhood
and
for
the
next
few
months
his
wife
earnings
and
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
his
watch
and
trinkets
kept
the
pair
of
them
but
there
came
a
time
when
his
wife
could
earn
no
more
and
then
a
son
was
born
to
him
in
this
contingency
he
deemed
himself
a
fortunate
man
in
being
able
to
get
a
lot
of
copying
to
do
for
a
law
firm
in
chancery
lane
but
poor
dick
trials
and
troubles
the
fruit
as
every
reasonable
person
must
admit
of
his
own
headstrong
folly
were
not
destined
to
be
of
long
duration
when
his
child
was
about
six
months
old
he
caught
a
fever
and
died
after
a
very
short
illness
one
of
his
last
requests
was
that
when
all
was
over
his
wife
should
write
and
inform
miss
baynard
of
his
death
this
cortelyon
did
not
fail
to
do
her
letter
conveyed
the
double
news
of
dick
death
and
the
birth
of
his
son
illustration
he
gave
her
the
address
of
his
wife
uncle
miss
baynard
at
once
took
the
letter
to
her
uncle
his
sallow
face
became
still
sallower
as
he
read
the
account
of
his
son
death
but
a
frown
deeper
than
the
girl
had
ever
seen
on
them
before
darkened
his
features
by
the
time
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
the
letter
had
dick
not
been
idiot
enough
to
wed
that
huzzy
he
said
the
lad
would
have
been
alive
i
owe
his
loss
to
her
neither
her
nor
her
brat
will
i
ever
countenance
or
acknowledge
tell
her
so
from
me
stay
though
you
may
send
her
this
note
with
the
assurance
that
it
is
the
last
money
she
will
ever
receive
at
my
hands
a
few
days
later
the
note
was
returned
to
the
squire
through
the
post
accompanied
by
a
few
unsigned
lines
to
the
effect
that
the
widow
of
richard
cortelyon
would
accept
no
help
at
the
hands
of
the
man
who
had
treated
her
husband
with
such
inhuman
cruelty
not
long
after
this
miss
baynard
wrote
to
the
widow
to
the
address
furnished
by
her
in
her
letter
mentioning
how
attached
she
had
been
to
dick
and
hinting
delicately
at
the
happiness
it
would
afford
her
to
send
cortelyon
a
little
monetary
help
now
and
again
but
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
her
letter
came
back
marked
gone
away
present
address
not
known
and
enclosed
in
an
official
envelope
it
had
been
opened
and
resealed
by
the
authorities
as
it
happened
the
letter
fell
into
the
squire
hands
who
noticing
only
the
official
envelope
opened
it
without
perceiving
that
it
was
addressed
to
his
niece
as
a
consequence
he
at
once
sent
for
her
after
explaining
how
it
happened
that
he
had
opened
the
letter
he
continued
i
am
astonished
and
annoyed
nell
very
seriously
annoyed
that
after
what
thou
heard
me
say
two
or
three
weeks
ago
thou
should
have
chosen
of
thy
own
accord
to
communicate
with
this
creature
and
even
to
offer
to
help
her
out
of
thy
own
scanty
means
fortunately
the
woman
has
disappeared
no
doubt
she
has
gone
back
to
the
life
and
the
companions
that
are
most
congenial
to
her
curses
on
her
for
a
vile
baggage
to
her
i
owe
it
that
my
boy
lies
mouldering
in
the
grave
never
again
nell
on
pain
of
offending
me
past
forgiveness
do
thou
attempt
to
have
aught
to
do
with
her
is
beneath
thee
to
notice
such
creatures
in
any
way
and
she
above
all
others
it
was
an
injunction
which
nell
who
had
listened
to
his
tirade
with
a
sort
of
proud
disdain
and
without
a
word
of
reply
determined
to
obey
or
disobey
as
circumstances
might
determine
for
the
present
she
was
helpless
to
do
more
than
she
had
done
unfortunately
she
had
mislaid
the
address
given
her
by
dick
at
parting
otherwise
she
might
perhaps
have
been
able
to
obtain
tidings
of
cortelyon
through
the
latter
uncle
the
london
tobacconist
chapter
family
matters
four
years
passed
away
without
bringing
any
further
tidings
of
the
widow
and
her
child
during
all
which
time
their
names
were
not
once
mentioned
between
uncle
and
niece
by
the
latter
their
existence
was
by
no
means
forgotten
she
often
thought
about
them
often
longed
to
see
them
whether
it
ever
entered
the
mind
of
squire
cortelyon
that
he
had
a
living
grandson
was
known
to
himself
alone
he
grew
old
and
made
no
sign
meanwhile
miss
baynard
had
shot
up
from
a
lanky
slip
of
a
girl
into
a
very
beautiful
young
woman
when
she
first
went
to
live
at
stanbrook
the
squire
having
no
female
element
in
his
house
of
a
higher
status
than
that
of
housekeeper
engaged
the
services
of
budd
widow
of
the
rev
onesimus
budd
for
the
dual
positions
of
and
companion
to
his
orphan
niece
budd
duties
as
governess
had
long
ago
come
to
an
end
but
therewith
she
had
assumed
what
to
many
people
would
have
seemed
the
much
more
responsible
and
onerous
post
of
chaperon
but
although
a
clever
little
woman
in
her
way
budd
was
nothing
if
not
for
her
the
wheels
of
existence
were
always
well
oiled
nothing
disturbed
her
much
responsibility
slid
off
her
like
water
off
a
duck
back
life
for
her
meant
little
more
than
a
sufficiency
of
sofas
fitted
with
the
softest
cushions
she
was
excessively
and
hating
to
be
worried
herself
was
careful
never
to
worry
others
she
and
her
charge
got
on
capitally
together
chiefly
because
she
was
too
wise
ever
to
offer
any
very
strenuous
opposition
to
the
whims
and
vagaries
of
that
young
woman
a
mild
protest
by
way
of
easement
to
her
conscience
she
did
now
and
then
venture
upon
which
however
miss
baynard
would
brush
aside
with
as
little
effort
or
compunction
as
she
would
a
cobweb
to
some
of
squire
cortelyon
neighbors
it
seemed
an
inconsistency
on
his
part
that
he
who
had
packed
off
his
son
to
school
at
the
earliest
possible
age
should
have
taken
to
his
hearth
and
have
kept
her
there
an
orphan
niece
of
no
fortune
when
he
might
so
easily
have
rid
himself
of
her
in
the
same
way
that
he
had
rid
himself
of
dick
and
certainly
as
has
been
remarked
the
squire
was
no
lover
of
children
and
was
generally
credited
with
not
having
an
ounce
of
sentiment
in
his
composition
for
all
that
miss
baynard
stayed
on
at
stanbrook
knowing
no
other
house
her
so
far
relaxing
his
ingrained
parsimony
on
her
account
as
to
pay
budd
salary
without
a
murmur
and
allow
his
niece
a
few
a
very
few
guineas
a
year
by
way
of
perhaps
it
might
be
said
of
ambrose
cortelyon
that
he
had
never
really
cared
but
for
one
person
and
that
one
his
sister
agatha
who
had
been
the
solitary
ray
of
sunshine
that
had
brightened
the
of
his
youth
a
youth
repressed
and
stunted
and
thrown
back
upon
itself
but
in
all
higher
respects
uncared
for
under
the
rule
of
a
tyrannical
and
passionate
father
who
was
accustomed
to
flog
him
unmercifully
for
the
most
trivial
offences
and
of
an
indifferent
mother
who
left
her
children
to
vegetate
in
the
country
for
three
parts
of
the
year
while
she
led
the
life
of
a
woman
of
fashion
in
town
but
agatha
cortelyon
in
the
course
of
time
had
grown
tired
and
sick
of
her
life
at
home
and
had
ended
by
running
away
with
and
becoming
the
wife
of
an
impecunious
young
lieutenant
in
a
marching
regiment
thereafter
brother
and
sister
had
never
met
the
young
wife
had
died
three
years
later
leaving
one
daughter
who
in
her
turn
had
grown
up
and
married
but
who
had
never
been
acknowledged
or
recognized
in
any
way
by
her
mother
family
she
also
had
died
young
her
husband
having
her
leaving
one
child
the
miss
elinor
baynard
with
whom
we
have
now
to
do
not
till
then
did
ambrose
cortelyon
become
aware
of
the
existence
of
his
he
had
heard
at
the
time
of
his
sister
death
but
no
further
news
having
reference
to
her
husband
or
child
had
reached
him
nor
had
he
ever
felt
the
least
inclination
to
seek
for
any
thus
to
find
himself
with
a
girl
of
twelve
of
whom
he
had
never
heard
thrown
on
his
hands
was
for
him
anything
but
an
agreeable
surprise
immediately
after
her
mother
funeral
the
child
had
been
packed
off
to
stanbrook
by
some
of
her
dead
father
who
had
neither
the
means
nor
the
will
to
keep
her
with
almost
as
little
ceremony
as
if
she
had
been
a
christmas
hamper
the
squire
happened
to
be
out
riding
when
nell
was
put
down
by
the
coach
at
the
gate
of
stanbrook
and
it
fell
to
dace
the
housekeeper
to
break
the
news
to
him
on
his
return
and
hand
him
a
letter
from
one
of
the
which
the
girl
had
brought
with
her
when
an
hour
later
the
squire
in
response
to
nell
timid
knock
at
the
library
door
gruffly
bade
her
enter
he
was
quite
prepared
to
dislike
her
at
first
sight
and
had
already
determined
in
his
mind
to
at
once
pack
her
off
to
some
cheap
country
school
and
so
rid
himself
at
any
rate
for
some
time
to
come
of
her
unwelcome
presence
under
his
roof
yet
somehow
he
did
neither
one
nor
the
other
was
it
because
he
was
struck
by
a
vague
elusive
something
in
the
girl
eyes
her
air
her
manner
and
the
way
she
carried
her
head
which
brought
vividly
to
mind
the
image
of
the
sister
of
his
youth
that
his
determination
to
send
her
away
presently
melted
into
thin
air
and
never
again
took
shape
in
his
thoughts
in
any
case
from
that
day
forward
stanbrook
was
nell
home
but
that
its
being
so
was
due
not
so
much
to
the
mere
tie
of
relationship
by
which
her
uncle
set
no
great
store
as
to
a
sentimental
recollection
on
his
part
was
what
she
had
no
knowledge
of
and
would
have
found
hard
to
credit
she
had
grown
up
and
and
with
no
small
share
of
that
determination
of
character
some
people
chiefly
such
as
had
come
into
contact
with
it
stigmatized
it
as
sheer
obstinacy
for
which
the
cortelyons
had
always
been
noted
but
above
and
beyond
that
she
had
an
intense
scorn
for
all
that
was
mean
base
sordid
or
and
she
was
never
slow
to
give
expression
to
it
for
many
of
the
small
conventions
and
grandmotherly
restrictions
with
which
society
at
that
period
leaving
the
present
out
of
question
saw
fit
to
hedge
round
its
fledglings
she
betrayed
a
fine
indifference
going
her
own
way
without
let
or
hindrance
and
without
deigning
a
thought
to
what
others
might
say
or
think
about
her
that
she
should
be
regarded
with
favorable
eyes
by
mothers
with
daughters
about
the
same
age
as
herself
could
hardly
be
expected
they
averred
that
she
set
their
darlings
a
dangerous
example
but
many
of
the
darlings
in
question
secretly
envied
her
and
wished
that
a
kind
fate
had
allowed
of
their
following
her
example
her
uncle
must
be
credited
with
allowing
her
to
do
pretty
much
as
she
liked
there
was
nothing
about
the
squire
he
was
a
strenuous
hater
of
shams
in
others
while
not
being
without
a
few
little
weaknesses
of
his
own
and
his
niece
somewhat
wilful
independence
of
character
secretly
delighted
him
even
when
as
sometimes
happened
it
opposed
itself
to
his
own
flinty
will
and
sparks
resulted
from
the
collision
between
two
people
so
constituted
there
could
be
and
was
no
question
of
sentiment
from
the
first
it
had
seemed
to
nell
that
her
uncle
simply
tolerated
her
presence
under
his
roof
he
had
taken
her
in
because
no
other
door
was
open
to
her
and
because
it
would
never
have
done
for
squire
cortelyon
niece
to
have
sought
the
shelter
of
the
workhouse
his
kindness
if
kindness
it
could
be
called
had
in
it
or
so
she
fancied
a
certain
grudging
element
which
deprived
it
of
whatever
grace
it
might
otherwise
have
had
she
knew
nothing
of
a
certain
strange
haunting
likeness
on
her
own
part
nor
how
often
when
her
uncle
eyes
seemed
to
be
watching
her
every
movement
it
was
not
her
he
saw
at
all
but
some
one
known
to
her
only
by
hearsay
who
had
been
in
her
grave
these
forty
years
or
more
when
dick
cortelyon
had
been
a
little
more
than
four
years
in
his
grave
the
squire
acting
on
his
doctor
advice
went
up
to
london
for
the
purpose
of
undergoing
a
certain
operation
it
was
an
operation
which
is
not
usually
supposed
to
be
attended
with
any
particular
risk
and
cortelyon
was
quite
cheerful
about
it
but
of
course
in
such
a
case
although
he
did
not
seem
to
think
so
the
question
of
age
becomes
an
important
factor
at
this
time
he
was
within
a
month
or
so
of
his
birthday
but
barring
his
permanent
lameness
the
result
of
an
accident
a
score
years
before
he
avouched
himself
to
be
and
he
fully
believed
it
as
brisk
and
robust
as
when
he
was
only
half
that
age
so
up
to
town
accompanied
by
his
niece
he
travelled
by
easy
stages
in
the
roomy
and
comfortable
if
somewhat
lumbering
family
chariot
which
dated
from
his
grandfather
time
while
perched
in
the
rumble
tatham
his
made
platonic
love
to
miss
baynard
elderly
maid
who
had
not
known
what
it
was
to
feel
a
man
arm
round
her
waist
for
more
years
than
she
cared
to
remember
comfortable
lodgings
in
bloomsbury
had
been
secured
beforehand
and
there
the
operation
was
presently
performed
by
one
of
the
most
eminent
surgeons
of
the
day
everything
went
well
with
the
squire
as
he
had
felt
sure
from
the
first
it
would
do
and
at
the
end
of
six
weeks
he
was
back
at
stanbrook
thoroughly
cured
but
miss
baynard
when
she
found
herself
in
london
set
herself
a
task
she
had
hitherto
had
no
opportunity
of
undertaking
this
was
nothing
less
than
the
of
her
dead
cousin
widow
and
child
as
already
stated
she
had
lost
the
address
given
her
by
dick
and
had
never
afterwards
found
it
she
remembered
that
the
name
on
the
slip
of
paper
that
of
dick
wife
uncle
was
mcmanus
and
that
the
man
was
a
tobacconist
in
a
small
way
of
business
in
one
of
the
many
turnings
off
holborn
but
the
name
of
the
street
itself
she
had
clean
forgotten
fortunately
for
her
purpose
there
was
a
sharp
youth
connected
with
the
lodgings
who
besides
making
himself
generally
useful
indoors
was
willing
to
run
on
errands
of
any
and
every
kind
for
anybody
disposed
to
pay
for
his
services
him
miss
baynard
engaged
to
discover
for
her
what
she
wanted
to
know
nor
had
she
long
to
wait
within
a
very
few
hours
he
placed
in
her
hands
the
address
of
mcmanus
chapter
vi
a
man
who
never
forgave
to
the
address
thus
obtained
by
her
her
uncle
being
now
well
on
the
road
to
recovery
miss
baynard
went
next
afternoon
in
a
accompanied
by
her
maid
mcmanus
a
little
old
and
very
snuffy
man
with
a
shrewd
but
kindly
expression
readily
furnished
her
with
the
information
asked
for
after
nell
had
introduced
herself
and
told
him
for
what
purpose
she
wanted
it
ah
poor
lass
i
sadly
afraid
she
not
long
for
this
world
remarked
the
old
fellow
with
a
melancholy
shake
of
the
head
in
allusion
to
dick
widow
is
she
so
ill
as
that
queried
nell
thoroughly
shocked
aye
that
is
she
long
afore
next
year
at
this
time
the
daisies
be
growin
over
her
grave
she
caught
a
chill
last
christmas
and
it
settled
on
her
chest
which
was
always
delicate
and
now
why
now
as
i
say
all
the
doctors
in
the
world
could
set
her
on
her
feet
again
i
can
not
tell
you
how
grieved
i
am
to
hear
this
and
the
boy
her
child
what
of
him
oh
he
as
right
as
a
trivet
a
famous
young
shaver
and
no
mistake
there
nothing
the
matter
with
him
miss
baynard
drove
direct
from
holborn
to
the
address
given
her
which
was
lawn
cottage
chelsea
there
marjory
cortelyon
rented
a
couple
of
rooms
a
widow
mardin
by
name
being
at
once
her
landlady
and
her
nurse
nell
having
sent
in
her
name
was
presently
admitted
to
the
little
with
its
pleasant
outlook
across
a
wide
sweep
of
sunny
meadows
long
ago
covered
with
bricks
and
mortar
the
lay
on
a
couch
near
the
window
a
frail
figure
wasted
by
illness
to
little
more
than
skin
and
bone
that
she
had
been
very
pretty
once
on
a
time
was
still
plainly
evident
and
in
her
large
lustrous
eyes
sunken
though
they
were
nell
read
something
which
went
direct
to
her
heart
there
had
never
been
anything
meretricious
or
tawdry
about
her
otherwise
dick
cortelyon
would
not
have
made
her
his
wife
she
had
been
good
and
pure
and
in
her
way
a
lady
nell
after
pausing
on
the
threshold
for
a
couple
of
seconds
while
she
took
in
the
scene
went
quickly
forward
and
dropping
on
one
knee
by
the
couch
bent
over
and
kissed
the
dying
woman
tears
dimmed
her
eyes
and
a
few
moments
passed
before
a
word
would
come
indeed
marjory
was
the
first
to
speak
at
the
touch
of
nell
lips
her
ivory
cheeks
flushed
and
a
lovely
smile
played
for
a
few
seconds
round
her
mouth
my
dick
loved
you
very
dearly
and
no
wonder
she
said
softly
i
have
often
longed
to
see
you
and
i
sure
i
shall
die
happier
now
that
i
have
done
so
nell
visit
lasted
upwards
of
an
hour
she
explained
to
marjory
how
it
happened
that
she
had
been
unable
either
to
communicate
with
her
or
to
visit
her
before
greatly
to
her
disappointment
young
evan
was
from
home
he
having
been
taken
into
the
country
to
spend
a
few
days
with
a
married
sister
of
marjory
but
nell
was
told
that
if
she
chose
to
come
again
in
a
week
time
he
would
then
be
back
and
this
she
promised
herself
that
she
certainly
would
do
by
and
by
nell
said
and
now
marjory
dear
you
must
allow
me
to
renew
the
offer
made
by
me
in
the
letter
which
failed
to
find
you
although
you
do
not
see
your
way
to
accept
pecuniary
help
from
cortelyon
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
you
should
not
accept
it
from
me
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
if
poor
dear
dick
could
speak
to
you
from
the
grave
he
would
agree
with
all
i
say
that
he
left
you
very
poorly
off
although
through
no
fault
of
his
own
i
know
full
well
therefore
i
say
again
why
not
the
sick
woman
held
up
one
of
her
transparent
hands
you
are
kindness
itself
miss
baynard
she
said
and
were
i
in
want
of
help
you
would
be
the
first
person
to
whom
i
would
appeal
but
i
am
not
in
want
of
anything
i
have
everything
i
need
and
more
thanks
to
the
generosity
of
geoffrey
dare
of
geoffrey
dare
echoed
nell
did
dick
never
speak
of
him
to
you
not
to
my
knowledge
but
you
must
remember
that
when
dick
first
came
to
london
i
was
hardly
out
of
the
schoolroom
and
that
we
saw
very
little
of
him
at
stanbrook
afterwards
before
that
last
visit
of
all
with
its
unhappy
ending
well
my
husband
and
geoff
dare
we
always
used
to
call
him
and
speak
of
him
as
were
like
brothers
not
that
all
brothers
hit
it
off
together
by
any
means
and
of
all
dick
many
fine
friends
he
was
the
only
that
was
in
the
secret
of
our
wedding
it
was
a
secret
he
told
to
nobody
and
when
dick
father
cast
him
off
and
hard
times
came
he
remained
just
the
same
geoff
that
he
had
always
been
not
the
least
bit
of
change
did
we
ever
find
in
him
then
when
my
child
was
born
nothing
would
suit
him
but
that
he
must
stand
godfather
to
it
all
through
dick
illness
which
lasted
a
matter
of
four
months
he
would
leave
his
gayeties
and
engagements
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
we
were
living
at
that
time
in
a
couple
of
rooms
in
clerkenwell
and
come
two
or
three
times
a
week
to
sit
with
him
and
cheer
him
up
and
when
all
was
over
it
was
his
money
that
helped
to
bury
my
husband
and
it
was
on
his
arm
that
i
leaned
as
i
stood
by
the
he
and
i
by
our
two
selves
is
there
any
one
like
him
in
the
world
i
wonder
she
sank
back
exhausted
but
a
little
wine
and
water
which
miss
baynard
proceeded
to
administer
speedily
revived
her
then
said
nell
judging
from
what
you
tell
me
dare
must
indeed
be
a
friend
among
a
thousand
and
for
what
he
has
done
for
you
and
yours
i
honor
and
respect
him
now
however
that
you
and
i
have
found
each
other
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
any
longer
burden
his
generosity
you
and
i
my
dear
marjory
are
cousins
dick
and
i
as
you
know
loved
each
other
like
brother
and
sister
consequently
it
is
to
me
and
to
me
only
that
you
and
evan
ought
to
look
in
time
to
come
a
faint
smile
it
might
almost
be
termed
a
smile
of
amusement
lighted
up
the
sick
woman
face
is
very
evident
that
you
do
know
geoff
dare
or
you
would
not
talk
like
that
she
said
why
merely
for
me
to
hint
at
such
a
thing
would
turn
him
into
a
thundercloud
and
then
there
would
be
an
explosion
fit
to
bring
the
roof
off
oh
he
has
a
fine
temper
of
his
own
i
can
tell
you
and
besides
and
worse
than
all
it
would
cut
him
to
the
quick
and
that
is
what
i
would
never
be
a
party
to
doing
then
again
dear
miss
baynard
it
is
as
if
he
was
a
poor
man
in
that
case
what
you
urge
would
bear
twice
thinking
about
but
geoff
is
anything
but
poor
although
so
dick
used
to
say
far
of
the
gaming
table
and
the
like
most
young
bucks
of
the
day
nell
sat
silent
if
not
convinced
the
ground
so
to
speak
had
been
cut
from
under
her
and
she
was
at
a
loss
what
to
say
next
presently
cortelyon
spoke
again
while
we
are
talking
about
dare
there
is
something
else
with
which
he
is
concerned
that
i
may
as
well
tell
you
about
as
my
doing
so
may
perhaps
prevent
any
misunderstanding
in
time
to
come
she
closed
her
eyes
for
a
few
seconds
while
she
inhaled
her
then
she
went
on
although
both
the
doctor
and
mardin
try
to
keep
the
truth
from
me
i
am
not
deceived
that
my
days
are
numbered
that
a
very
few
weeks
will
bring
the
end
i
know
full
well
and
dare
knows
it
too
the
last
time
he
was
here
i
challenged
him
with
the
truth
and
he
could
not
deny
it
it
was
the
uncertainty
about
my
child
future
which
lay
like
a
dead
weight
at
my
heart
that
impelled
me
to
do
so
but
he
god
bless
him
for
it
at
once
put
my
mind
at
rest
on
that
score
he
gave
me
his
solemn
promise
that
when
i
am
gone
he
will
act
a
father
part
by
his
dead
friend
child
he
will
bring
up
evan
as
if
he
were
his
own
son
that
the
boy
is
his
godson
i
have
already
told
you
but
what
if
evan
grandfather
should
some
day
change
his
mind
and
want
to
claim
him
the
question
sprang
to
nell
lips
almost
before
she
knew
that
it
had
formed
itself
in
her
mind
an
angry
light
leapt
into
the
young
widow
eyes
a
spot
of
vivid
red
flamed
out
in
either
cheek
for
a
moment
or
two
she
bit
her
nether
lip
hard
as
if
thereby
to
control
her
emotion
then
she
said
if
i
thought
there
was
any
likelihood
of
my
darling
ever
falling
into
the
hands
of
that
cruel
and
wicked
old
man
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
should
never
rest
in
my
grave
oh
if
only
when
i
am
dead
i
may
be
allowed
to
haunt
him
but
you
do
not
think
do
you
dear
miss
baynard
that
he
is
ever
likely
to
want
to
claim
evan
one
never
can
tell
what
may
happen
even
the
most
people
sometimes
see
reason
to
change
their
mind
my
uncle
is
an
old
man
and
evan
is
his
lineal
heir
he
has
neither
child
nor
grandchild
but
him
what
more
natural
than
that
he
should
some
day
turn
round
hold
out
his
arms
and
say
past
is
dead
and
buried
come
to
me
you
belong
to
me
and
to
me
only
i
am
rich
and
all
that
i
have
is
yours
what
is
to
hinder
such
a
thing
from
coming
to
pass
cortelyon
remained
silent
for
a
few
moments
as
if
considering
the
picture
thus
presented
to
her
then
she
said
when
geoff
comes
next
i
must
talk
to
him
about
it
you
have
frightened
me
neither
he
nor
i
have
dreamt
of
such
a
possibility
when
i
am
dead
the
child
must
disappear
he
must
be
hidden
away
by
geoff
where
the
squire
should
he
ever
want
to
do
so
could
not
find
him
rather
i
truly
believe
could
i
bear
to
see
evan
stark
in
his
coffin
than
walking
hand
in
hand
with
that
old
man
i
never
hated
any
one
in
my
life
as
i
hate
him
and
i
shall
keep
on
hating
him
after
i
am
dead
miss
baynard
paid
two
more
visits
to
lawn
cottage
before
the
time
came
for
her
and
her
uncle
to
go
back
to
stanbrook
evan
was
at
home
on
both
occasions
and
on
both
occasions
they
went
together
for
a
long
walk
the
boy
took
to
her
from
the
first
he
was
a
handsome
healthy
child
and
or
so
it
seemed
to
nell
wonderfully
like
what
his
father
must
have
been
at
the
same
age
she
would
have
liked
dearly
to
take
him
and
set
him
down
suddenly
in
front
of
the
squire
and
leave
the
rest
to
nature
prompting
but
such
a
course
was
out
of
the
question
all
she
could
do
was
to
extort
a
promise
from
cortelyon
that
if
that
should
come
to
pass
which
she
herself
asserted
to
be
inevitable
and
the
boy
before
long
be
left
motherless
then
should
she
nell
be
informed
either
by
dare
or
mcmanus
where
he
could
at
any
time
be
found
and
should
be
allowed
to
have
access
to
him
as
often
as
she
might
feel
disposed
to
claim
the
privilege
when
the
time
came
for
the
two
women
to
say
goodbye
both
knew
that
the
parting
was
a
final
one
but
not
a
word
was
said
by
either
to
that
effect
both
feigned
a
cheerfulness
which
was
the
last
thing
in
the
heart
of
either
and
it
was
a
relief
to
both
when
the
ordeal
was
over
and
the
door
shut
between
them
then
came
the
time
for
tears
before
leaving
town
nell
paid
a
second
visit
to
mcmanus
and
got
him
to
promise
to
write
to
her
as
soon
as
all
was
over
it
was
a
promise
the
old
tobacconist
faithfully
kept
and
nell
had
only
been
six
weeks
back
at
home
when
the
fatal
tidings
reached
her
after
a
little
time
given
to
tears
in
the
solitude
of
her
room
she
dried
her
eyes
and
went
in
search
of
her
uncle
she
found
him
in
the
library
dusting
and
gloating
over
one
of
his
cases
of
coins
he
looked
up
sourly
as
the
door
opened
when
so
engaged
he
did
not
like
being
interrupted
but
for
that
nell
cared
not
at
all
walking
directly
up
to
the
table
she
said
without
preface
uncle
news
has
just
reached
me
of
the
death
of
poor
dick
widow
she
died
of
consumption
three
days
ago
the
squire
dropped
his
duster
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
grasped
an
arm
of
it
with
either
hand
and
turned
his
cold
eyes
full
upon
her
and
pray
miss
baynard
may
i
ask
in
what
way
the
news
concerns
me
he
had
not
called
her
miss
baynard
since
her
last
mention
of
her
cousin
name
more
than
four
years
before
and
nell
did
not
forget
it
but
she
was
in
no
wise
daunted
if
you
choose
to
consider
that
the
death
of
your
son
wife
is
no
concern
of
yours
so
be
it
that
is
a
matter
between
yourself
and
your
conscience
but
in
case
the
fact
should
have
escaped
your
memory
i
may
be
allowed
to
remind
you
that
dick
left
a
child
behind
him
a
son
who
is
now
both
fatherless
and
motherless
and
what
have
i
to
do
with
that
everything
he
is
your
grandson
your
sole
descendant
your
natural
heir
he
is
flesh
of
your
flesh
bone
of
your
bone
and
ought
to
be
dearer
to
you
than
all
the
world
beside
poor
dick
died
years
ago
why
avenge
his
fault
if
fault
it
was
on
his
innocent
child
think
uncle
think
and
he
brought
down
his
fist
heavily
on
the
table
think
girl
thou
zounds
there
no
need
for
me
to
think
my
mind
was
made
up
long
ago
and
nothing
thou
urge
will
move
me
from
it
i
tell
thee
my
grandson
is
no
more
to
me
than
the
veriest
beggar
brat
that
crawls
in
a
london
gutter
never
will
i
acknowledge
him
or
have
aught
to
do
with
him
in
any
way
and
if
thou
hast
any
regard
left
for
me
or
any
care
for
my
displeasure
thou
wilt
never
speak
of
him
in
my
presence
again
as
thou
ought
to
have
found
out
by
now
i
am
a
man
who
never
forgives
chapter
vii
who
shall
be
heir
from
that
day
forward
ambrose
cortelyon
seemed
to
regard
his
niece
with
a
certain
amount
of
suspicion
and
distrust
but
it
was
a
distrust
that
found
no
expression
in
words
and
although
nell
was
conscious
of
an
undefinable
change
in
her
uncle
manner
towards
her
she
was
wholly
at
a
loss
to
what
cause
to
attribute
it
the
squire
was
a
man
who
expected
those
of
his
household
and
all
who
were
in
any
way
dependent
on
him
not
merely
to
believe
as
he
believed
but
to
share
his
conviction
that
whatever
decision
he
might
come
to
in
any
given
set
of
circumstances
was
the
right
one
and
that
all
who
differed
from
him
were
theoretically
either
fools
or
worse
in
short
he
was
one
of
that
numerous
class
who
have
a
firm
belief
in
their
own
infallibility
in
all
the
concerns
of
life
and
as
he
was
an
autocrat
in
his
own
domain
with
nobody
to
contradict
him
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
his
opinion
of
himself
would
become
less
confirmed
with
advancing
years
when
therefore
his
niece
chose
to
impugn
his
action
in
a
certain
affair
and
he
now
called
to
mind
that
it
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
done
so
and
even
to
imply
not
by
her
words
but
by
her
manner
that
his
treatment
of
his
grandson
or
to
speak
correctly
his
absolute
neglect
of
him
was
both
cruel
and
unjust
he
was
not
at
any
rate
at
first
so
much
angered
as
amazed
at
her
audacity
in
daring
to
set
up
her
feeble
girl
will
in
opposition
to
his
own
and
indeed
at
her
presumption
in
venturing
to
question
his
decision
in
any
way
nor
when
he
came
to
think
the
matter
over
at
his
leisure
did
his
surprise
not
unleavened
with
resentment
diminish
he
told
himself
that
he
could
not
have
believed
it
of
her
she
had
hurt
him
in
a
tender
place
and
he
felt
as
if
she
could
never
be
quite
the
same
to
him
again
as
she
had
been
in
the
past
and
she
never
was
it
is
just
possible
that
the
squire
little
smoulder
of
resentment
against
his
niece
would
gradually
have
died
out
had
he
not
been
beset
by
a
certain
underlying
consciousness
of
which
he
vainly
strove
to
rid
himself
that
all
through
nell
had
been
undeniably
in
the
right
and
he
indisputably
in
the
wrong
had
he
but
seen
his
way
to
overlook
his
son
and
have
brought
him
and
his
wife
to
stanbrook
in
all
probability
dick
would
still
have
been
living
and
then
with
regard
to
this
grandson
of
his
this
child
of
a
mother
but
when
he
got
as
far
as
that
in
his
musings
his
passion
seemed
to
choke
him
no
he
had
done
right
quite
right
no
other
course
was
open
to
him
come
what
might
he
would
never
acknowledge
the
brat
his
blood
was
tainted
he
was
no
true
cortelyon
but
all
his
arguing
with
himself
did
not
suffice
to
pluck
out
the
hidden
thorn
it
was
still
there
rankling
in
his
flesh
but
if
he
could
not
get
rid
of
it
no
one
save
himself
should
know
of
its
existence
and
he
swore
a
great
oath
that
in
the
matter
of
his
grandson
he
would
not
go
back
from
his
word
a
day
or
two
after
her
interview
with
her
uncle
nell
replied
to
mcmanus
letter
what
she
wished
him
to
do
was
to
inform
dare
that
he
need
be
under
no
apprehension
that
cortelyon
would
claim
his
grandson
or
interfere
in
any
way
with
the
boy
future
she
further
asked
to
be
informed
of
the
latter
address
when
dare
should
have
settled
upon
a
home
for
him
to
this
the
old
tobacconist
replied
in
the
course
of
a
week
or
two
what
he
had
to
tell
her
was
that
for
the
present
dare
had
decided
to
let
evan
remain
at
lawn
cottage
in
the
care
of
mardin
but
that
should
he
later
think
well
to
remove
the
child
miss
baynard
should
be
duly
advised
of
the
change
and
there
for
the
present
the
matter
rested
when
squire
cortelyon
found
himself
once
more
at
home
he
went
back
to
his
old
mode
of
life
with
an
added
relish
he
knew
now
that
he
had
just
escaped
a
great
danger
he
had
been
led
to
believe
that
the
operation
he
was
advised
to
undergo
was
of
a
very
simple
nature
but
a
casual
remark
of
the
great
london
doctor
which
he
chanced
to
overhear
had
served
to
open
his
eyes
after
a
very
uncomfortable
fashion
in
reality
the
operation
was
anything
but
a
simple
one
in
view
of
possible
consequences
in
the
case
of
a
man
of
threescore
years
and
ten
however
all
is
well
that
ends
well
the
dreaded
consequences
had
not
developed
themselves
he
had
come
back
home
feeling
a
new
man
with
every
prospect
of
a
renewed
lease
of
life
and
he
smiled
grimly
to
himself
to
think
how
that
scoundrel
of
a
banks
his
local
medico
had
succeeded
in
thoroughly
hoodwinking
him
so
he
went
back
to
the
old
familiar
routine
as
if
there
had
never
been
a
break
in
it
save
that
life
seemed
to
have
taken
on
an
added
sweetness
now
that
he
knew
what
he
had
escaped
he
trembled
when
he
thought
of
the
risk
he
had
run
not
merely
in
one
way
but
in
another
for
had
the
operation
had
a
fatal
termination
he
would
have
died
intestate
he
had
torn
up
his
will
after
his
quarrel
with
dick
and
had
never
made
another
in
which
case
his
detested
grandson
would
have
been
his
and
have
inherited
everything
it
was
enough
to
put
him
in
a
cold
sweat
when
he
thought
of
it
of
course
the
day
would
come
when
he
could
no
longer
defer
asking
himself
the
question
to
whom
or
to
what
shall
i
leave
my
property
but
it
was
an
uncomfortable
question
to
face
and
a
difficult
one
to
answer
so
as
there
seemed
no
immediate
need
for
answering
it
he
shelved
it
till
what
he
chose
to
term
a
more
convenient
time
pleasant
to
him
were
those
long
forenoons
in
the
library
with
no
company
save
that
of
andry
luce
who
kept
his
accounts
looked
after
his
rents
and
to
whom
he
dictated
his
correspondence
pleasant
it
was
with
the
help
of
andry
sturdy
arm
to
stroll
slowly
about
the
grounds
watching
the
gardeners
and
laborers
at
their
work
chatting
with
his
bailiff
and
giving
his
orders
about
this
or
the
other
not
less
pleasant
was
it
when
the
fit
took
him
to
have
himself
driven
in
his
old
shandrydan
to
one
or
other
of
his
outlying
properties
some
of
which
lay
many
miles
away
and
satisfy
himself
that
everything
was
going
on
as
it
should
do
which
meant
so
far
as
the
interests
of
his
own
pocket
were
concerned
but
when
the
weather
was
bad
and
he
could
not
get
out
of
doors
he
had
other
occupations
wherewith
to
engage
his
time
he
was
an
ardent
numismatist
and
was
very
proud
of
his
collection
of
coins
and
medals
to
which
he
kept
adding
from
time
to
time
as
opportunity
served
he
was
also
something
of
a
bibliophile
and
possessed
a
small
but
rather
choice
collection
of
rare
books
and
illuminated
mss
he
would
gloat
over
these
treasures
as
a
miser
gloats
over
his
gold
and
he
derived
the
most
intense
satisfaction
from
the
belief
which
on
no
account
would
he
have
had
disturbed
that
his
collections
contained
two
or
three
absolutely
unique
specimens
in
the
way
of
coins
such
as
no
other
cabinet
could
match
and
so
some
months
passed
away
and
no
such
person
as
young
evan
cortelyon
might
have
been
in
existence
for
any
mention
of
him
between
uncle
and
niece
then
as
the
winter
crept
springward
the
squire
became
unpleasantly
conscious
that
his
physical
powers
were
slowly
almost
imperceptibly
declining
for
some
little
time
he
succeeded
in
persuading
himself
that
it
was
a
mere
temporary
from
which
he
was
suffering
due
probably
in
a
great
measure
to
the
moist
oppressiveness
of
an
unhealthy
season
which
was
carrying
off
numbers
of
younger
people
than
he
but
when
at
length
the
weather
vane
on
the
stables
veered
from
southwest
to
northeast
and
stuck
there
day
after
day
as
if
it
would
never
move
again
bringing
with
it
dry
sunny
morns
and
crisp
bracing
nights
he
was
obliged
to
seek
for
some
other
excuse
for
his
growing
weakness
not
yet
however
would
he
give
in
and
summon
banks
although
the
son
on
whom
he
had
at
one
time
built
such
hopes
was
dead
and
gone
not
for
years
had
existence
been
sweeter
to
him
than
it
was
just
then
and
yet
to
all
seeming
it
was
gradually
but
surely
slipping
away
from
him
he
felt
as
if
a
great
wrong
were
being
done
him
what
was
providence
about
at
length
his
weakness
so
far
increased
that
he
reluctantly
authorized
andry
to
summon
banks
who
had
attended
him
off
and
on
from
the
date
of
his
accident
and
in
the
course
of
years
had
extracted
more
guineas
from
his
purse
than
the
squire
cared
to
reckon
up
you
have
been
very
remiss
cortelyon
very
remiss
indeed
said
the
fussy
little
rural
practitioner
when
he
had
completed
his
brief
examination
and
had
listened
to
the
squire
recital
of
his
symptoms
you
ought
to
have
sent
for
me
six
weeks
ago
if
not
earlier
than
that
there
has
been
a
serious
lowering
of
the
vital
forces
and
at
your
time
of
life
at
my
time
of
life
damme
what
d
mean
you
do
mean
to
call
me
an
old
man
and
i
not
till
next
birthday
zounds
only
just
in
my
prime
banks
you
an
ass
it
will
be
time
enough
for
you
to
begin
to
hint
at
my
age
only
to
hint
at
it
mind
you
a
dozen
years
hence
banks
did
his
best
but
his
best
in
this
instance
proved
of
no
avail
the
diminution
of
strength
still
went
slowly
on
at
length
the
squire
became
too
weak
to
go
out
of
doors
even
for
a
drive
and
then
after
a
time
the
day
came
when
he
was
unable
to
leave
his
bedroom
at
banks
request
that
physician
mills
of
lanchester
was
called
into
consultation
but
all
he
could
do
after
making
one
or
two
minor
suggestions
was
to
accord
his
full
approval
to
the
treatment
already
adopted
by
his
colleague
i
wo
pay
you
your
fee
doctor
hang
me
if
i
will
sir
till
you
tell
me
what
you
think
of
me
said
the
squire
in
his
masterful
way
when
mills
was
ready
to
go
well
squire
to
be
frank
with
you
i
think
your
condition
a
somewhat
grave
one
but
while
there
life
there
hope
you
know
yes
yes
we
must
give
up
hope
on
any
account
and
you
could
not
be
in
better
hands
than
those
of
my
friend
dr
banks
you
would
advise
me
to
make
my
will
eh
the
cunning
smile
with
which
he
leered
up
into
the
physician
face
hid
a
terrible
anxiety
at
the
back
of
it
the
doctor
pursed
out
his
lips
in
such
matters
it
is
always
advisable
to
be
prepared
to
take
time
by
the
forelock
as
one
may
say
and
in
your
case
cortelyon
i
am
inclined
to
think
um
well
yes
that
any
testamentary
arrangements
you
may
have
to
make
should
not
i
understand
broke
in
the
squire
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
not
a
word
more
is
needed
here
is
your
fee
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
your
frankness
and
so
to
ye
he
felt
as
if
sentence
of
death
had
just
been
pronounced
on
him
yes
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
cheat
himself
with
vain
hopes
of
recovery
the
dread
fact
that
for
him
life
business
was
nearly
over
could
no
longer
be
ignored
and
the
sooner
he
clasped
it
to
him
and
made
himself
familiar
with
its
grim
visage
the
better
it
would
be
for
him
during
the
little
time
he
could
call
his
own
he
had
lately
had
private
information
from
piljoy
that
a
certain
property
on
which
for
years
he
had
set
longing
eyes
would
be
in
the
market
before
another
twelvemonth
was
over
and
yet
he
ambrose
cortelyon
would
not
be
there
to
bid
for
it
again
he
asked
himself
what
providence
was
about
still
however
much
he
might
rail
and
rebel
in
secret
at
the
dark
prospect
before
him
knowing
all
the
while
how
childish
and
futile
it
was
to
do
so
his
hard
face
in
nowise
softened
to
those
about
him
and
he
betrayed
no
slackness
of
interest
in
any
of
the
little
everyday
affairs
that
went
on
around
him
but
another
spectre
besides
that
grisly
one
which
mills
words
had
called
up
began
to
haunt
him
hovering
round
his
pillow
by
night
and
never
being
far
from
his
elbow
between
daybreak
and
dark
there
was
only
one
way
of
exorcising
it
as
he
knew
full
well
and
that
was
by
making
his
will
the
entail
had
been
cut
off
in
his
time
sixty
years
before
how
hateful
soever
the
necessity
might
be
it
was
one
which
could
not
with
safety
be
much
longer
delayed
unless
he
wished
that
all
he
might
die
worth
should
go
to
his
disowned
and
unknown
grandson
beyond
him
and
nell
so
far
as
he
knew
he
had
not
a
single
living
relative
whom
then
should
he
make
his
heir
for
him
it
was
fast
becoming
the
question
of
questions
oh
it
was
hard
hard
while
he
was
still
in
what
rightly
considered
ought
to
be
looked
upon
as
the
prime
of
life
to
have
to
part
from
the
earthly
possessions
he
loved
so
well
and
which
had
cost
him
such
long
and
painful
scraping
to
accumulate
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
leave
them
he
must
the
fatal
fiat
had
gone
forth
at
times
it
may
be
his
heart
sent
forth
an
anguished
cry
for
his
dead
son
but
if
such
were
the
case
it
in
nowise
served
to
mitigate
the
rancor
almost
inhuman
in
its
bitterness
with
which
he
regarded
the
dead
child
he
had
spoken
no
more
than
the
truth
when
he
said
that
he
never
forgave
it
was
just
about
this
time
that
the
hon
bullivant
having
heard
of
his
illness
drove
over
from
uplands
to
see
him
the
squire
had
never
been
very
popular
among
those
of
his
own
class
and
even
now
when
he
was
reported
to
be
in
failing
health
there
were
not
many
callers
at
stanbrook
such
as
there
were
got
no
farther
than
the
entrance
hall
for
in
each
case
the
squire
on
the
plea
of
illness
excused
himself
from
seeing
them
and
probably
the
majority
of
them
were
as
well
pleased
that
he
did
so
but
of
the
hon
bullivant
a
special
exception
was
made
she
was
shown
up
into
his
bedroom
where
the
squire
lay
in
his
huge
propped
up
with
pillows
and
there
she
stayed
for
upwards
of
an
hour
for
this
however
there
was
a
reason
bullivant
when
known
to
the
world
as
miss
onoria
flood
the
only
daughter
and
heiress
of
a
wealthy
brewer
was
the
lady
chosen
by
cortelyon
for
his
son
prospective
wife
he
and
mr
flood
were
neighbors
so
to
speak
for
only
a
short
miles
divided
uplands
from
stanbrook
and
when
once
the
subject
was
broached
by
the
squire
in
the
first
instance
they
were
not
long
in
coming
to
a
quiet
understanding
between
themselves
then
mr
flood
dropped
a
hint
of
what
was
in
the
wind
to
onoria
who
was
a
dutiful
daughter
and
at
once
fell
in
with
her
father
views
after
that
all
the
squire
had
to
do
was
to
recall
his
son
from
london
and
break
the
news
to
him
to
cortelyon
the
match
seemed
an
eminently
desirable
one
although
the
brewer
did
not
come
of
a
county
family
he
was
most
respectably
connected
having
one
brother
an
archdeacon
and
another
high
up
in
the
service
of
john
company
but
the
great
attraction
of
all
lay
in
the
fact
that
on
coming
of
age
onoria
would
be
entitled
to
a
legacy
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
bequeathed
her
by
her
grandfather
further
she
would
be
her
father
sole
heiress
he
had
flood
word
for
that
and
as
the
brewer
was
of
a
gouty
habit
and
somewhat
plethoric
withal
it
seemed
not
unlikely
that
yes
in
every
way
a
most
desirable
match
but
we
know
what
happened
when
dick
was
told
his
father
goodwill
and
pleasure
in
the
matter
however
willing
under
other
circumstances
he
might
have
been
to
fall
in
with
the
old
man
views
he
was
precluded
from
doing
so
by
the
simple
fact
that
he
was
already
a
married
man
thereupon
followed
the
quarrel
and
all
that
sad
succession
of
events
with
which
we
are
already
acquainted
but
onoria
did
not
go
long
unwedded
before
six
months
had
gone
by
she
became
the
wife
of
the
hon
hector
bullivant
the
second
son
of
lord
cossington
an
impecunious
peer
whose
estates
were
mortgaged
up
to
the
hilt
neither
affection
nor
sentiment
had
anything
to
do
with
the
union
onoria
married
for
position
the
hon
hector
for
money
everybody
who
knew
the
young
couple
said
that
what
followed
was
only
what
they
had
prophesied
all
along
so
easy
is
it
to
be
wise
after
the
event
the
hon
hector
was
a
notorious
gambler
and
and
within
a
couple
of
years
of
his
marriage
he
had
contrived
to
dissipate
his
wife
fortune
to
the
last
guinea
a
few
months
later
he
came
by
his
end
in
a
drunken
brawl
greatly
to
the
relief
of
everybody
connected
with
him
leaving
behind
him
one
child
a
boy
a
little
over
twelve
months
old
then
the
widow
went
back
home
to
her
father
taking
her
son
with
her
not
long
afterwards
mr
flood
was
carried
off
in
a
fit
of
apoplexy
when
his
will
was
read
it
was
a
terrible
disappointment
to
onoria
to
find
that
instead
of
coming
in
for
everything
as
she
had
all
along
been
led
to
expect
she
would
she
was
merely
left
an
income
of
six
hundred
a
year
together
with
the
uplands
estate
and
that
everything
else
was
left
in
trust
for
her
son
she
had
known
that
her
father
was
not
likely
to
be
a
long
liver
and
backed
up
by
his
wealth
she
had
looked
forward
to
a
brilliant
into
london
society
at
no
very
distant
date
with
it
may
be
a
second
and
more
brilliant
marriage
in
the
background
it
was
indeed
a
terrible
disappointment
bullivant
at
this
period
of
her
life
was
what
is
generally
understood
by
the
term
a
fine
woman
that
is
to
say
she
was
built
on
ample
lines
and
was
of
generous
proportions
later
on
she
would
tend
to
obesity
she
was
and
with
regular
features
of
a
cold
statuesque
type
which
as
she
was
essentially
unemotional
and
a
thorough
specimen
of
ingrained
selfishness
formed
a
fair
enough
index
to
her
disposition
such
was
the
woman
who
came
one
day
to
see
squire
cortelyon
on
what
she
had
been
given
to
understand
was
likely
to
be
his
deathbed
as
a
matter
of
course
she
knew
of
the
quarrel
between
father
and
son
of
dick
untimely
death
and
of
his
having
left
a
widow
and
a
child
whom
the
old
man
refused
to
acknowledge
or
to
recognize
in
any
way
she
and
the
squire
had
not
met
since
a
little
while
before
her
marriage
still
it
seemed
only
what
was
due
to
good
feeling
and
neighborly
sympathy
more
especially
in
view
of
what
had
happened
in
the
past
that
she
should
be
desirous
of
seeing
him
once
again
before
it
was
too
late
if
there
was
any
other
motive
or
at
work
below
the
surface
she
would
hardly
have
confessed
its
existence
even
to
herself
as
already
stated
the
interview
between
her
and
the
squire
lasted
over
an
hour
by
the
time
it
came
to
an
end
the
sick
man
was
pretty
well
exhausted
still
he
was
glad
he
was
very
glad
that
he
had
seen
her
her
visit
had
supplied
him
with
a
ray
of
light
where
all
had
been
darkness
before
she
was
a
woman
after
his
own
heart
energetic
capable
a
man
as
regarded
business
ability
of
a
like
saving
disposition
and
with
an
ambition
similar
to
his
own
that
is
to
say
to
become
a
great
landed
proprietor
or
rather
that
her
son
should
become
one
when
he
grew
up
and
came
into
his
inheritance
he
did
not
think
that
flood
had
treated
her
as
handsomely
as
he
ought
to
have
done
still
uplands
was
hers
a
fine
property
and
one
which
could
not
have
come
into
more
capable
hands
had
the
fates
proved
propitious
onoria
would
have
been
his
it
was
owing
to
no
fault
of
hers
that
she
was
not
consequently
she
might
in
a
sense
be
said
to
have
a
claim
upon
him
why
should
he
not
leave
her
a
in
his
landed
property
the
same
at
her
decease
to
devolve
upon
her
son
on
condition
of
his
adding
the
name
of
cortelyon
to
his
present
one
but
it
was
a
project
not
to
be
hastily
decided
upon
he
would
think
it
over
and
he
did

a
woman
of
a
thousand
about
this
time
tatham
the
squire
fell
ill
and
at
his
own
request
was
allowed
to
leave
stanbrook
for
awhile
and
go
to
stay
with
his
married
sister
who
lived
in
the
next
county
hitherto
he
and
miss
baynard
had
shared
the
duties
of
the
between
them
and
as
the
squire
instead
of
gathering
strength
seemed
to
be
slowly
losing
what
little
was
left
him
it
was
evident
that
some
one
must
be
found
to
fill
tatham
place
during
his
unavoidable
absence
now
in
the
village
a
populous
and
thriving
one
the
outlying
houses
of
which
lay
within
a
bowshot
of
the
park
gates
of
stanbrook
there
dwelt
at
this
time
a
certain
dinkel
herself
english
but
the
widow
of
a
dutchman
who
had
formerly
been
head
gardener
at
heronscourt
the
seat
of
sir
willoughby
freke
dinkel
had
been
left
with
enough
to
keep
her
comfortably
in
humble
village
fashion
but
being
at
the
time
of
her
husband
death
scarcely
beyond
middle
age
and
of
an
active
disposition
she
presently
began
to
cast
about
for
some
way
not
merely
of
adding
to
her
limited
income
but
of
banishing
from
her
life
the
idleness
which
her
soul
abhorred
being
determined
to
find
work
she
took
the
first
chance
that
came
in
her
way
which
was
to
nurse
a
young
lady
laid
up
with
a
virulent
fever
and
thus
it
fell
out
that
within
a
couple
of
years
of
that
time
dinkel
name
had
become
well
known
throughout
a
wide
circle
of
provincial
society
as
that
of
a
woman
with
a
born
gift
for
nursing
like
many
others
of
both
sexes
she
had
not
discovered
her
till
late
in
life
but
having
once
found
it
she
stuck
to
it
still
her
services
were
not
at
the
beck
and
call
of
anybody
nor
were
they
to
be
bought
merely
by
the
offer
of
a
certain
number
of
guineas
she
would
only
go
out
to
nurse
among
gentlefolk
or
as
she
termed
them
the
quality
and
whenever
none
of
the
quality
stood
in
need
of
her
services
she
preferred
to
stay
at
home
with
folded
hands
doing
nothing
till
they
should
send
for
her
when
a
message
from
stanbrook
one
day
reached
her
she
responded
to
it
with
alacrity
to
the
squire
it
seemed
very
inconsiderate
on
tatham
part
that
he
should
choose
to
fall
ill
at
such
a
time
but
as
he
supposed
there
was
no
help
for
it
it
mattered
not
a
jot
to
him
he
said
whom
they
supplied
him
with
by
way
of
temporary
substitute
so
at
the
express
instance
of
banks
dinkel
was
sent
for
she
was
a
woman
of
few
words
and
strong
nerve
who
seemed
never
to
require
more
than
two
hours
sleep
out
of
the
all
her
thoughts
and
attention
were
given
to
her
patient
she
moved
about
the
sick
room
almost
as
silently
as
a
shadow
and
before
long
the
squire
found
her
presence
far
more
soothing
and
her
ministrations
far
more
gentle
than
those
of
tatham
had
been
nell
took
to
dinkel
from
the
first
they
seemed
to
understand
each
other
instinctively
the
sick
man
was
the
bond
between
them
each
in
her
separate
way
had
for
the
time
being
vowed
herself
to
his
service
a
few
days
later
and
cortelyon
had
finally
made
up
his
mind
bitter
as
the
need
for
doing
so
was
to
him
but
it
was
indeed
high
time
that
he
should
come
to
some
conclusion
for
the
sands
of
life
were
now
beginning
to
run
very
low
indeed
and
he
knew
it
what
but
a
little
while
before
had
been
a
suggestion
not
emanating
from
any
outside
source
but
his
own
suggestion
to
himself
had
now
become
a
determination
to
bullivant
in
the
first
place
and
to
her
son
after
her
he
would
bequeath
of
everything
he
was
worth
he
was
quite
aware
that
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
his
grandson
being
out
of
the
running
his
niece
claim
upon
him
ought
to
have
had
priority
of
that
of
everybody
else
and
he
told
himself
that
it
should
have
had
if
only
nell
had
been
a
sensible
businesslike
woman
of
the
type
of
onoria
bullivant
unfortunately
she
was
nothing
of
the
kind
instead
her
head
was
crammed
full
of
sentimental
and
quixotic
notions
he
prided
himself
on
having
read
her
thoroughly
and
he
felt
morally
sure
that
if
he
were
to
leave
her
any
large
lump
sum
say
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
pounds
by
way
of
legacy
she
would
be
quite
capable
when
she
found
that
master
evan
had
been
left
out
in
the
cold
of
making
over
a
big
slice
perhaps
even
the
whole
of
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
brat
such
a
result
as
that
must
on
no
account
be
allowed
to
come
to
pass
what
he
would
do
was
to
invest
a
certain
number
of
thousands
in
her
name
in
the
funds
just
enough
to
bring
in
about
three
hundred
a
year
and
allow
her
the
interest
to
live
upon
with
such
an
income
she
could
not
do
much
harm
or
what
the
squire
designated
to
himself
as
harm
should
she
be
fool
enough
to
take
the
boy
to
live
with
her
and
assume
the
responsibility
of
his
future
why
she
was
welcome
to
do
so
but
owner
of
stanbrook
and
barrowmead
and
of
his
latest
purchase
that
big
property
on
the
yorkshire
border
his
grandson
never
should
be
thus
it
one
day
came
to
pass
that
bullivant
received
a
note
written
by
andry
luce
asking
her
if
convenient
to
drive
over
next
day
to
stanbrook
in
time
for
luncheon
and
take
her
son
with
her
the
widow
was
a
shrewd
woman
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
such
a
note
was
capable
of
but
one
interpretation
and
as
she
drove
through
the
country
lanes
next
day
on
her
way
to
the
hall
her
heart
beat
high
with
hopes
which
however
wanting
in
substance
they
might
be
were
none
the
less
de
in
point
of
fact
before
causing
his
testamentary
dispositions
to
be
recorded
in
black
and
white
the
squire
was
desirous
of
taking
stock
of
the
youngster
whom
he
was
proposing
to
constitute
his
heir
if
he
should
prove
to
be
a
weak
puling
child
or
betray
any
signs
of
delicacy
of
constitution
why
in
that
case
that
there
would
be
good
reason
for
reconsidering
his
decision
as
it
turned
out
the
squire
had
no
cause
for
uneasiness
on
that
score
young
gavin
bullivant
who
had
just
entered
on
his
fifth
year
looked
as
strong
and
sturdy
as
an
oak
sapling
he
was
a
lad
both
inquisitive
and
acquisitive
by
natural
disposition
and
not
knowing
what
shyness
meant
he
was
very
like
his
mother
but
more
in
expression
than
features
and
at
times
one
caught
a
hint
of
something
in
his
face
at
once
hard
and
cunning
which
seemed
curiously
out
of
keeping
with
his
years
it
was
as
though
a
very
old
man
and
not
a
good
old
man
either
was
peering
at
you
from
behind
a
beautiful
mask
of
childhood
not
much
likeness
here
to
the
late
lamented
hey
queried
the
squire
after
a
good
stare
at
him
which
the
boy
returned
with
interest
cortleyon
had
only
met
the
hon
hector
on
one
occasion
at
a
sale
of
some
of
lord
cossington
stock
and
had
felt
no
desire
to
cultivate
his
acquaintance
it
may
seem
like
to
say
so
replied
bullivant
with
a
complacent
smile
but
both
in
looks
and
disposition
dear
gavin
takes
wholly
after
me
even
his
grandfather
can
not
help
admitting
as
much
then
the
squire
proceeded
to
put
several
questions
to
the
lad
which
he
answered
with
promptitude
and
aplomb
he
betrayed
no
timidity
in
the
presence
of
the
sick
man
although
to
many
a
child
of
his
age
the
latter
would
have
seemed
a
sufficiently
formidable
object
with
his
skin
his
hollow
cheeks
his
heavy
grizzled
eyebrows
which
seemed
bent
in
a
perpetual
frown
and
the
strange
eyes
beneath
them
in
which
the
flame
of
life
seemed
to
burn
all
the
more
strongly
just
now
because
it
was
so
soon
to
be
extinguished
forever
after
that
gavin
was
planted
in
the
big
with
a
supply
of
sweet
cakes
to
keep
him
quiet
while
his
mother
and
the
squire
talked
together
in
confidential
fashion
but
it
was
not
in
gavin
to
keep
quiet
for
any
length
of
time
and
hardly
had
the
last
cake
gone
the
way
of
the
rest
before
he
had
slid
from
his
perch
to
the
ground
bent
on
a
more
minute
inspection
of
the
room
and
its
contents
than
he
had
yet
been
able
to
give
them
so
while
the
two
elder
people
talked
together
in
low
tones
he
went
about
his
task
examining
this
object
and
the
other
opening
every
drawer
that
was
unlocked
in
the
big
escritoire
and
making
a
study
of
its
contents
and
in
all
respects
making
himself
thoroughly
at
home
at
the
end
of
of
an
hour
bullivant
rose
to
take
her
leave
for
the
squire
was
showing
signs
of
fatigue
there
was
upon
her
a
sense
of
disappointment
for
nothing
of
a
confidential
nature
had
fallen
from
the
sick
man
lips
and
she
was
still
at
a
loss
to
imagine
not
merely
why
she
had
been
sent
for
but
why
she
had
been
asked
to
bring
gavin
with
her
sick
people
are
subject
to
strange
whims
but
surely
there
was
something
more
than
a
whim
at
the
back
of
cortelyon
request
to
see
her
son
the
squire
keen
eyes
seemed
to
be
reading
her
thoughts
onoria
he
said
and
he
was
holding
her
hand
as
he
spoke
onoria
i
am
about
to
make
my
will
a
new
one
for
i
destroyed
the
old
one
some
years
ago
and
i
have
sent
for
you
in
order
to
tell
you
that
it
is
my
intention
to
bequeath
you
the
sum
of
three
thousand
pounds
nor
will
the
boy
be
forgotten
as
you
will
find
when
my
testament
comes
to
be
read
no
thanks
please
they
would
only
worry
me
and
and
i
afford
to
be
worried
nowadays
bullivant
raised
the
hand
that
was
holding
hers
to
her
lips
and
kissed
it
dear
cortelyon
she
said
and
for
once
her
voice
had
or
seemed
to
have
a
tremor
in
it
although
you
forbid
me
to
thank
you
for
your
act
of
noble
generosity
to
me
and
my
son
you
can
not
at
any
rate
hinder
me
from
remembering
you
in
my
prayers
illustration
his
mother
now
produced
the
squire
watch
and
appendages
a
cynical
smile
lighted
up
the
squire
haggard
face
perhaps
the
picture
of
bullivant
on
her
knees
returning
thanks
for
a
thumping
legacy
for
that
was
the
form
her
remembrance
of
him
would
take
if
it
took
any
struck
him
as
being
a
trifle
incongruous
next
moment
an
exclamation
escaped
him
he
had
suddenly
missed
his
big
gold
watch
with
its
pendant
of
seals
and
trinkets
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
keeping
within
reach
on
the
little
table
by
his
bedside
that
it
had
been
there
only
a
few
minutes
before
he
was
fully
convinced
whither
then
had
it
vanished
bullivant
at
once
began
a
search
for
the
missing
article
but
at
the
end
of
two
or
three
minutes
she
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job
then
her
eyes
fell
on
gavin
who
had
gone
back
to
his
perch
on
the
and
had
been
watching
her
movements
with
much
apparent
interest
she
knew
from
previous
experience
that
when
he
looked
the
most
cherubic
he
was
usually
most
in
fault
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
appeared
too
unconscious
to
be
wholly
innocent
come
here
she
said
beckoning
him
with
her
finger
he
obeyed
without
hesitation
he
had
only
lately
been
breeched
and
very
proud
he
was
at
having
been
emancipated
from
petticoats
pockets
had
not
been
omitted
from
his
jean
trousers
cut
short
in
the
leg
as
was
the
fashion
so
as
to
leave
displayed
an
amplitude
of
white
stocking
and
from
one
of
them
his
mother
now
produced
the
squire
watch
and
appendages
he
flushed
a
little
and
threw
a
timorous
glance
at
the
sick
man
but
on
the
whole
his
mother
was
the
more
put
about
of
the
two
i
can
not
imagine
what
made
him
do
such
a
thing
she
said
with
tears
of
vexation
in
her
eyes
but
you
may
rest
assured
dear
cortelyon
that
i
will
not
fail
to
chastise
him
most
severely
when
we
reach
home
but
the
squire
was
sniggering
i
trust
onoria
you
will
do
no
such
thing
he
said
it
was
merely
the
trick
of
a
child
too
young
to
know
the
difference
between
and
the
best
course
will
be
to
overlook
it
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
no
consequence
and
so
leave
him
to
forget
it
indeed
i
am
rather
glad
than
otherwise
to
have
had
such
a
proof
of
the
young
rascal
acquisitive
faculty
it
goes
i
think
to
prove
that
he
will
not
grow
up
a
prodigal
like
his
father
when
his
visitors
had
left
him
the
squire
lay
for
some
time
deep
in
thought
at
length
he
said
speaking
aloud
for
he
had
just
taken
his
cordial
and
was
alone
the
more
i
see
of
her
the
more
confirmed
i
am
in
my
decision
her
views
in
all
that
relates
to
the
great
question
of
property
are
almost
the
counterpart
of
my
own
she
is
a
woman
of
a
thousand
what
an
admirable
she
would
have
made
if
only
that
poor
headstrong
lad
of
mine
had
but
why
go
back
to
that
business
even
in
thought
the
past
is
dead
and
buried
we
have
now
to
deal
with
the
present
and
to
arrange
for
the
future
i
would
give
something
to
be
able
to
see
onoria
face
while
she
is
hearing
the
will
read
i
told
her
about
the
legacy
of
three
thousand
pounds
but
i
said
nothing
about
a
in
my
landed
estate
i
have
left
that
by
way
of
a
surprise
and
what
a
joyful
surprise
it
will
be
to
her
well
well
i
will
send
for
piljoy
it
was
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
after
bullivant
last
visit
that
piljoy
arrived
at
stanbrook
he
was
genuinely
shocked
at
the
condition
in
which
he
found
the
squire
whose
confidential
business
agent
he
had
been
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
the
sick
man
lamp
of
life
had
indeed
flickered
down
to
a
very
feeble
flame
evidently
no
time
must
be
lost
in
having
the
document
drawn
up
and
then
signed
and
witnessed
in
due
form
so
for
a
full
hour
or
more
the
two
men
lawyer
and
client
were
closeted
together
in
the
latter
bedroom
the
will
itself
engrossed
and
ready
for
signature
was
to
be
brought
by
piljoy
three
days
later
the
lawyer
was
to
dine
and
stay
the
night
at
stanbrook
as
he
had
done
many
times
before
and
in
order
that
he
should
not
lack
company
his
old
acquaintance
herries
the
vicar
had
been
asked
to
meet
him
miss
baynard
and
budd
honored
the
two
gentlemen
with
their
company
at
dinner
but
left
them
to
their
own
devices
as
soon
as
the
meal
was
over
then
the
lawyer
and
the
vicar
the
latter
of
whom
was
a
jovial
parson
of
what
we
are
accustomed
to
term
the
old
school
drew
their
chairs
closer
in
anticipation
of
a
pleasant
evening
over
their
long
pipes
and
a
steaming
bowl
of
punch
and
in
all
likelihood
they
were
not
disappointed
at
ten
the
vicar
man
came
with
a
lantern
to
light
his
master
home
by
this
time
piljoy
was
not
quite
so
steady
on
his
feet
as
he
customarily
was
and
when
andry
luce
brought
him
his
and
proffered
his
arm
to
help
him
upstairs
he
accepted
it
without
demur
for
he
had
sense
enough
to
know
that
at
his
time
of
life
it
would
not
do
to
risk
a
fall
but
indeed
andry
had
helped
him
in
similar
fashion
on
more
than
one
occasion
before
nor
did
the
thoughtful
andry
leave
him
till
he
had
helped
him
off
with
his
coat
waistcoat
cravat
gaiters
and
shoes
he
also
wound
up
his
watch
and
placed
it
together
with
his
purse
and
bunch
of
keys
on
the
one
of
the
abominations
of
those
days
known
as
a
rushlight
was
left
to
burn
itself
away
an
hour
later
andry
minus
his
shoes
stole
into
the
bedroom
having
earlier
in
the
evening
taken
the
precaution
to
abstract
the
key
of
the
door
the
lawyer
measured
breathing
convinced
him
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
inside
the
small
valise
piljoy
had
brought
with
him
he
found
the
paper
of
instructions
for
the
of
the
squire
will
to
make
himself
master
of
its
contents
was
the
object
of
his
nocturnal
intrusion
five
minutes
by
the
dim
aid
of
the
rushlight
sufficed
for
his
purpose
then
he
put
the
paper
back
and
went
his
way
as
silently
as
he
had
come
piljoy
left
stanbrook
immediately
after
breakfast
and
without
seeing
the
squire
again
travelling
as
he
always
did
on
such
occasions
by
chapter
ix
converging
threads
in
the
course
of
the
same
forenoon
andry
luce
sought
miss
baynard
with
the
view
of
making
a
certain
private
communication
to
her
talking
on
andry
part
was
of
course
done
by
means
of
his
fingers
but
long
practice
had
made
nell
an
adept
at
reading
the
language
of
the
dumb
andry
who
retained
no
recollection
of
his
parents
in
his
brooding
fashion
had
never
really
cared
but
for
two
people
his
young
master
dick
cortelyon
and
miss
baynard
one
of
them
was
dead
and
to
the
other
was
now
given
a
double
measure
of
that
love
and
devotion
which
had
sprung
from
his
heart
the
moment
he
first
set
eyes
on
her
and
had
burnt
there
with
a
steady
unflickering
flame
ever
since
she
was
the
secret
goddess
at
whose
shrine
he
worshipped
daily
his
love
was
unmixed
with
any
taint
of
ordinary
passion
and
was
as
absolutely
pure
as
that
of
a
father
for
his
child
it
was
the
one
of
living
water
his
maimed
life
knew
there
was
nothing
in
the
wide
world
he
would
not
have
done
or
have
attempted
at
miss
baynard
bidding
his
object
in
seeing
her
this
morning
was
to
enlighten
her
with
regard
to
the
provisions
of
the
squire
new
will
which
piljoy
was
to
bring
a
couple
of
days
hence
for
the
purpose
of
having
it
signed
and
witnessed
he
did
not
tell
her
through
what
channel
he
had
obtained
his
information
and
naturally
enough
nell
imagined
that
it
was
he
and
not
piljoy
who
had
drawn
up
the
instructions
or
at
any
rate
that
he
had
been
present
at
their
specification
by
her
uncle
but
before
andry
fingers
working
although
they
were
at
their
quickest
had
got
more
than
half
through
their
tale
nell
thoughts
were
otherwise
engaged
she
was
rendered
terribly
indignant
as
andry
knew
full
well
she
would
be
by
the
thought
of
the
gross
and
cruel
injustice
of
which
cortelyon
meditated
making
his
innocent
grandson
the
victim
she
was
made
both
to
love
strongly
and
to
hate
strongly
and
there
was
nothing
she
hated
more
than
aught
that
savored
of
cruelty
or
injustice
she
had
loved
poor
dead
and
gone
dick
as
a
younger
sister
loves
a
handsome
generous
elder
brother
and
it
made
her
blood
boil
to
think
that
his
child
should
be
treated
as
an
outcast
from
the
hearth
to
which
he
ought
to
have
been
welcomed
as
the
pride
and
the
heir
but
what
could
be
done
how
could
the
purpose
of
this
most
iniquitous
will
be
defeated
she
could
discern
no
way
none
she
was
as
helpless
in
the
matter
as
a
babe
tears
hot
and
passionate
were
shed
by
her
in
the
privacy
of
her
own
room
but
of
what
avail
are
a
tears
they
fall
only
to
be
dried
up
as
quickly
as
a
summer
shower
now
it
so
happened
that
about
this
time
a
certain
peripatetic
dealer
in
rare
books
coins
and
curios
of
different
kinds
of
whom
cortelyon
had
made
sundry
purchases
at
various
times
called
at
stanbrook
on
purpose
to
submit
to
the
squire
a
choice
illuminated
of
the
fifteenth
century
for
which
he
was
desirous
of
finding
a
customer
the
price
asked
was
a
high
one
but
after
a
little
haggling
he
was
too
weak
to
hold
out
long
the
squire
agreed
to
pay
it
rather
than
let
the
treasure
go
it
was
not
so
much
that
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
it
on
his
own
account
as
he
believed
that
in
it
he
had
secured
a
rarity
to
possess
which
his
friend
delafosse
who
was
also
a
bibliophile
and
a
numismatist
but
more
of
the
former
than
the
latter
would
be
willing
to
give
in
exchange
a
certain
unique
stater
of
epaticcus
which
he
ambrose
cortelyon
had
long
coveted
although
he
believed
himself
to
be
so
near
his
end
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
should
die
happier
with
the
precious
stater
shut
up
in
his
palm
and
the
knowledge
that
at
last
it
was
his
own
yes
nell
should
go
to
dene
house
taking
the
with
her
and
negotiate
the
exchange
she
was
already
known
to
delafosse
who
was
no
stranger
at
stanbrook
and
in
point
of
fact
was
a
special
favorite
of
the
old
collector
dene
house
was
some
miles
away
across
country
she
could
go
on
horseback
accompanied
by
john
dyce
by
way
of
escort
so
great
became
his
impatience
that
he
would
have
her
set
out
that
very
afternoon
the
days
were
already
long
and
she
could
reach
dene
house
soon
after
sunset
stay
there
overnight
delafosse
would
give
her
a
hearty
welcome
and
be
back
home
before
noon
on
the
morrow
so
nell
was
sent
for
and
the
manuscript
given
into
her
charge
by
this
time
her
uncle
weakness
had
become
so
extreme
that
his
wishes
and
instructions
had
perforce
to
be
limited
to
a
few
whispered
sentences
but
nell
gave
him
to
understand
that
she
knew
exactly
what
he
wanted
done
and
he
was
satisfied
she
would
set
out
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
and
be
back
by
midday
on
the
morrow
about
an
hour
later
banks
arrived
accompanied
by
mills
the
squire
had
expressed
a
wish
to
see
the
latter
about
once
a
week
and
although
all
the
doctors
in
the
world
could
have
done
nothing
for
him
that
was
no
reason
why
his
whim
should
not
be
humored
but
there
was
no
need
for
a
lengthened
visit
and
the
pair
had
come
and
gone
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
this
was
the
day
fixed
for
the
return
of
piljoy
with
the
will
and
about
two
a
drove
up
from
which
however
there
alighted
not
the
lawyer
himself
but
his
managing
clerk
tew
piljoy
he
reported
was
laid
up
with
gout
and
unable
to
come
but
he
tew
was
just
as
competent
to
see
to
the
proper
signing
of
the
will
tew
was
not
sorry
to
be
told
that
the
squire
was
asleep
and
must
on
no
account
be
disturbed
he
was
both
tired
and
hungry
and
was
glad
to
be
able
to
put
the
hospitality
of
stanbrook
to
the
proof
before
having
to
attend
to
the
business
which
had
taken
him
there
it
was
not
till
close
upon
five
that
he
was
summoned
to
the
squire
presence
the
sick
man
was
alone
propped
up
in
bed
as
usual
but
andry
luce
had
been
instructed
to
keep
within
hearing
of
his
master
bell
tew
having
explained
the
cause
of
his
employer
absence
went
on
at
the
squire
request
to
read
the
will
aloud
slowly
and
deliberately
the
testator
giving
a
nod
of
approval
at
the
end
of
each
clause
five
or
six
minutes
brought
the
reading
to
an
end
and
as
he
took
off
his
spectacles
tew
said
i
presume
sir
that
your
witnesses
are
in
readiness
the
squire
nodded
ask
andry
to
summon
the
gardener
and
the
groom
they
have
been
told
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
he
whispered
the
two
subordinates
in
question
were
not
long
in
making
their
appearance
and
very
albeit
somewhat
sheepish
they
looked
they
did
not
know
they
had
been
chosen
as
witnesses
because
most
of
the
older
servants
were
legatees
under
the
will
whereas
they
were
not
mentioned
in
it
besides
it
had
been
ascertained
that
they
could
actually
sign
their
names
which
for
persons
of
their
class
was
regarded
in
those
days
as
a
very
considerable
accomplishment
then
andry
who
had
charge
of
the
proceedings
brought
in
the
big
leaden
inkstand
together
with
a
couple
of
quill
pens
which
he
had
cut
and
trimmed
specially
for
the
occasion
all
being
in
readiness
andry
put
a
stalwart
arm
round
his
master
and
held
him
in
a
firm
support
while
the
latter
with
slow
and
painful
elaborateness
wrote
his
name
at
the
foot
of
the
will
which
tew
held
for
him
in
a
convenient
position
that
done
the
groom
and
the
gardener
in
turn
followed
their
master
example
not
without
many
strange
facial
contortions
as
the
pen
travelled
shakily
over
the
parchment
then
they
touched
their
forelocks
and
shuffled
out
of
the
room
glad
the
ceremony
was
over
and
yet
feeling
themselves
to
be
much
more
important
persons
than
they
had
been
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
as
they
shambled
downstairs
they
whispered
to
each
other
that
they
had
set
eyes
on
th
owd
squire
for
the
last
time
of
the
contents
of
the
document
signed
by
them
they
knew
nothing
they
had
been
told
it
was
their
employer
will
and
that
was
enough
for
them
tew
was
not
allowed
to
leave
stanbrook
till
after
dinner
nor
indeed
had
he
any
particular
desire
to
do
so
he
could
not
stay
overnight
as
piljoy
would
have
done
but
so
long
as
he
was
back
at
business
by
nine
on
the
morrow
that
was
all
that
would
be
expected
of
him
he
was
carrying
back
with
him
the
signed
will
in
an
envelope
sealed
with
the
squire
own
seal
to
be
retained
in
the
custody
of
his
employer
till
the
time
should
have
come
for
it
to
be
made
public
budd
and
he
dined
alone
he
was
told
that
miss
baynard
to
whom
he
had
been
introduced
earlier
in
the
afternoon
had
in
the
meantime
left
the
hall
on
some
private
business
for
her
uncle
and
was
not
expected
back
till
next
day
shortly
after
seven
tew
who
was
beginning
to
be
a
little
muddled
with
the
quantity
of
old
port
he
had
imbibed
bade
budd
an
almost
affectionate
farewell
she
was
a
widow
and
to
his
thinking
still
a
charming
woman
climbed
into
his
chaise
and
was
driven
off
on
his
return
to
arkrigg
night
settled
down
over
the
old
house
in
those
remote
country
parts
people
kept
early
hours
and
when
the
hall
clock
chimed
the
past
ten
the
only
light
left
burning
in
the
hall
was
the
one
in
the
sick
man
room
near
it
sat
nurse
dinkel
busily
knitting
for
she
could
not
bear
her
fingers
to
be
idle
but
watchful
and
alert
as
she
always
was
the
squire
did
not
like
to
be
looked
at
as
he
lay
there
and
from
where
she
sat
she
could
not
see
him
for
the
heavy
curtains
that
shrouded
the
head
of
the
bed
but
the
slightest
movement
of
his
fingers
on
the
counterpane
drew
her
to
his
side
she
was
a
woman
of
some
education
and
had
a
low
and
pleasant
voice
and
as
cortelyon
nights
were
often
restless
and
wakeful
he
had
got
into
the
way
of
occasionally
asking
her
to
read
aloud
to
him
her
doing
so
took
him
for
a
time
out
of
the
dungeon
of
his
own
thoughts
and
sometimes
brought
in
its
train
the
sleep
he
longed
for
so
after
lying
awake
for
some
time
as
motionless
as
if
he
were
already
dead
he
said
nurse
yes
sir
i
want
you
to
read
to
me
his
voice
was
still
very
feeble
but
stronger
than
it
had
been
in
the
afternoon
such
fluctuations
were
frequent
with
him
yes
sir
what
would
you
like
shall
i
go
on
with
pope
from
where
we
left
off
the
night
before
last
aye
you
ca
improve
on
him
draw
back
this
curtain
that
i
may
the
better
hear
you
when
the
curtain
had
been
drawn
back
nurse
dinkel
did
not
return
to
her
chair
but
stood
there
looking
at
her
patient
nursing
an
elbow
in
either
hand
cortelyon
sir
she
said
after
a
brief
pause
i
have
something
on
my
mind
which
i
wish
most
particularly
to
say
to
you
if
you
will
kindly
give
me
leave
to
do
so
surely
dinkel
i
will
listen
to
anything
you
may
have
to
say
but
do
stand
there
while
you
talk
go
back
to
your
chair
thank
you
sir
she
said
as
she
resumed
her
seat
i
will
try
not
to
tire
you
although
what
i
wish
to
say
may
at
the
beginning
seem
a
bit
tedious
you
may
or
may
not
be
aware
sir
that
i
have
a
son
cornelius
by
name
who
is
now
turned
thirty
years
of
age
when
he
was
quite
a
boy
and
a
clever
boy
he
was
though
is
i
who
say
it
the
late
sir
willoughby
freke
took
a
great
fancy
to
him
in
the
course
of
time
he
went
to
london
at
sir
willoughby
expense
for
he
was
bent
on
studying
to
become
a
doctor
and
study
he
did
to
such
good
purpose
that
he
passed
all
his
examinations
with
flying
colors
hardly
however
had
he
obtained
his
diploma
before
a
very
good
offer
was
made
him
to
go
out
to
java
where
he
has
relations
on
his
father
side
engaged
in
business
it
was
an
offer
he
felt
bound
to
accept
that
was
ten
years
ago
and
now
he
has
come
back
to
england
and
is
not
going
abroad
any
more
his
home
will
be
in
london
but
before
settling
down
there
he
has
come
to
spend
a
little
time
with
his
old
mother
from
whom
he
has
been
so
long
parted
and
now
sir
i
come
to
the
reason
why
i
have
taken
on
myself
to
trouble
you
with
all
these
dry
particulars
my
son
has
brought
a
wonderful
discovery
back
with
him
from
the
east
according
to
his
account
it
will
cure
certain
diseases
after
all
other
medicines
have
been
tried
in
vain
and
in
some
cases
will
almost
bring
dead
people
back
to
life
what
the
drug
consists
of
i
can
not
tell
you
because
that
is
my
son
secret
and
one
which
he
would
not
think
of
opening
his
lips
about
even
to
me
all
i
know
is
that
the
chief
ingredient
is
the
powdered
bark
of
a
certain
tree
of
which
he
has
brought
a
considerable
supply
back
with
him
cornelius
feels
as
sure
as
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
be
of
anything
that
he
has
only
to
introduce
his
discovery
to
the
medical
world
of
london
to
find
himself
on
the
high
road
to
a
big
fortune
his
heart
is
buoyed
up
not
merely
by
hope
but
by
certainty
well
sir
no
longer
ago
than
last
sunday
afternoon
when
you
and
miss
baynard
were
good
enough
to
spare
me
from
my
duties
for
a
few
hours
i
had
a
long
talk
with
my
son
and
took
the
liberty
of
telling
him
about
your
illness
and
what
do
you
think
he
said
sir
why
this
cortelyon
could
only
be
persuaded
into
trying
my
drug
i
feel
sure
that
it
would
give
him
a
new
lease
of
life
those
were
his
very
words
sir
new
lease
of
life
the
squire
lay
silent
for
a
little
while
then
he
said
and
it
is
your
opinion
that
i
ought
to
allow
myself
to
be
experimented
upon
by
this
vaunted
remedy
of
your
son
most
emphatically
it
is
sir
cornelius
is
no
idle
boaster
he
always
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
and
he
would
not
have
said
what
he
did
without
good
reason
he
tried
the
drug
again
and
again
in
several
desperate
cases
before
he
left
batavia
and
in
no
instance
was
it
a
failure
but
i
am
an
old
man
dinkel
and
my
case
is
not
one
of
any
particular
disorder
but
a
gradual
decay
of
the
vital
forces
which
can
have
but
one
end
and
that
is
now
close
at
hand
do
say
that
sir
i
beg
who
can
say
what
wonder
my
son
remedy
might
not
effect
even
in
your
case
as
it
has
already
done
in
those
of
others
it
is
true
that
neither
banks
nor
mills
seems
able
to
do
anything
for
you
but
that
is
no
reason
why
you
should
refuse
the
help
now
offered
you
from
another
source
my
son
knows
your
age
within
a
year
or
two
i
described
to
him
all
about
your
illness
and
yet
for
all
that
it
is
his
deliberate
opinion
that
he
can
give
you
a
fresh
lease
of
life
again
the
squire
lay
for
some
time
without
speaking
only
one
quack
the
more
he
murmured
to
himself
with
a
touch
of
his
old
cynicism
well
why
not
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
they
quacks
every
mother
son
of
as
it
is
i
at
death
door
already
and
if
the
fellow
can
do
me
no
good
i
defy
him
to
do
me
much
harm
then
he
said
aloud
know
i
half
inclined
to
let
this
son
of
yours
experiment
upon
me
if
only
to
take
some
of
the
brag
out
of
him
and
prove
to
him
that
in
such
a
case
as
mine
his
stuff
is
no
more
effectual
than
a
dose
of
senna
would
be
then
you
try
it
sir
that
is
all
i
ask
in
any
case
no
harm
can
come
of
it
my
own
opinion
exactly
with
a
dismal
attempt
at
a
chuckle
yes
i
agree
to
try
it
only
the
affair
must
be
kept
secret
outside
this
room
nobody
must
know
about
it
unless
it
be
my
man
andry
luce
and
now
when
can
this
son
of
yours
be
smuggled
into
the
house
it
only
a
little
past
eleven
sir
and
if
you
think
you
can
spare
me
i
will
go
at
once
and
bring
him
back
with
me
the
servants
are
all
abed
and
my
son
could
come
and
go
without
one
of
them
being
a
whit
the
wiser
that
a
very
good
notion
of
yours
damme
go
at
once
my
dear
woman
but
first
give
me
a
drink
of
that
cordial
i
shall
want
nothing
till
you
get
back
and
if
i
can
coax
that
shy
dog
morpheus
to
keep
me
company
meanwhile
so
much
the
better
chapter
x
the
sequel
of
miss
baynard
adventure
it
was
with
a
bitter
sense
of
helplessness
that
miss
baynard
continued
to
brood
over
the
news
brought
her
by
andry
luce
the
knowledge
that
with
the
exception
of
a
certain
legacy
to
herself
and
sundry
small
bequests
to
old
servants
the
whole
of
her
uncle
wealth
both
in
land
and
money
would
go
to
bullivant
and
her
son
who
were
not
even
cousins
six
times
removed
cut
her
to
the
quick
the
amazing
injustice
of
the
thing
so
to
speak
struck
her
dumb
to
think
that
a
man
who
knew
full
well
his
span
of
life
had
dwindled
to
a
few
brief
hours
should
in
cold
blood
choose
to
perpetrate
so
black
a
sin
for
in
her
eyes
it
was
nothing
less
was
to
nell
wholly
inconceivable
and
all
for
what
merely
because
his
son
had
married
beneath
him
and
had
thereby
brought
to
naught
a
certain
ambitious
scheme
on
which
his
heart
had
been
set
and
now
the
innocent
child
was
to
suffer
for
its
father
fault
if
fault
it
were
oh
it
was
monstrous
monstrous
of
one
thing
she
was
quite
sure
she
would
never
touch
her
legacy
every
shilling
of
it
should
go
to
the
boy
but
what
was
such
a
pittance
in
comparison
with
the
income
which
when
he
should
come
of
age
ought
to
be
his
of
inalienable
right
yet
his
name
was
not
once
mentioned
in
the
will
the
last
of
the
cortelyons
bone
of
his
bone
and
flesh
of
his
flesh
might
die
in
a
gutter
or
come
to
the
gallows
for
anything
the
old
man
cared
such
a
revenge
was
more
than
human
it
was
fiendish
and
could
only
have
been
prompted
by
the
devil
nell
burnt
from
head
to
foot
with
a
fine
flame
of
indignation
when
she
thought
of
these
things
and
for
the
next
hours
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
it
was
in
the
course
of
the
second
afternoon
after
andry
luce
had
told
her
that
she
happened
herself
unseen
to
overhear
the
two
doctors
talking
together
as
they
stood
for
a
few
moments
in
the
corridor
after
coming
out
of
her
uncle
room
i
give
him
three
days
at
the
outside
one
of
them
said
to
which
the
other
replied
hum
i
daresay
you
are
right
but
i
should
be
a
bit
surprised
if
he
were
to
go
off
in
his
sleep
between
now
and
nell
gave
one
quick
gasp
and
a
shudder
ran
through
her
from
head
to
foot
she
had
known
for
some
time
what
each
day
was
bringing
nearer
but
to
hear
from
the
lips
of
those
who
knew
that
the
end
was
so
close
came
upon
her
with
a
shock
and
for
a
moment
or
two
made
her
feel
as
if
she
had
suddenly
come
face
to
face
with
a
skeleton
it
was
the
day
piljoy
had
promised
to
bring
the
will
for
the
purpose
of
having
it
signed
and
as
she
remembered
this
she
could
not
help
saying
to
herself
if
i
could
only
get
hold
of
it
and
destroy
it
my
uncle
would
hardly
live
to
sign
another
in
its
stead
and
evan
as
his
grandfather
would
succeed
to
everything
then
a
little
derisive
laugh
at
her
folly
broke
from
her
lips
get
hold
of
the
will
forsooth
why
she
would
not
be
allowed
to
so
much
as
set
eyes
on
it
her
brain
must
be
softening
even
to
imagine
such
a
thing
about
an
hour
later
her
uncle
sent
for
her
it
was
in
connection
with
the
errand
to
delafosse
that
he
wanted
to
see
her
having
received
her
instructions
given
brokenly
and
in
whispers
and
had
the
precious
committed
to
her
charge
she
left
the
room
he
gazed
after
her
a
little
wistfully
as
it
seemed
thinking
perhaps
that
she
might
have
kissed
him
before
going
for
in
his
heart
he
loved
the
girl
as
at
another
time
she
most
likely
would
have
done
but
her
proud
set
face
had
never
changed
while
he
gave
her
his
message
and
when
he
had
done
she
simply
inclined
her
head
and
went
she
felt
that
even
if
she
were
never
to
see
him
alive
again
she
could
not
forgive
him
but
he
did
not
know
that
about
two
tew
in
piljoy
stead
arrived
with
the
will
in
the
absence
of
budd
who
had
gone
into
the
village
he
was
received
by
miss
baynard
to
whom
he
explained
the
nature
of
his
business
and
apologized
for
his
employer
absence
nell
heart
grew
cold
as
she
listened
why
did
not
providence
intervene
and
not
allow
so
black
a
deed
to
be
consummated
if
only
tew
arrival
had
been
delayed
for
two
or
three
days
she
would
not
have
cared
by
what
means
then
would
he
have
come
too
late
and
all
would
have
been
well
as
it
was
she
could
but
wring
her
hands
in
sheer
helplessness
she
was
going
sadly
upstairs
to
her
own
room
after
seeing
tew
planted
in
front
of
a
pigeon
pie
when
an
idea
flashed
across
her
brain
which
for
a
moment
or
two
seemed
mentally
to
blind
her
but
it
was
a
notion
at
once
so
wild
and
extravagant
that
after
drawing
one
long
breath
her
hands
went
involuntarily
to
her
head
and
she
said
to
herself
my
reason
must
be
deserting
me
for
all
that
she
could
not
thrust
the
notion
from
her
indeed
it
had
taken
such
a
firm
grip
of
her
that
when
she
reached
her
room
she
found
herself
under
compulsion
to
sit
down
and
face
it
and
however
bizarre
and
impracticable
it
had
at
first
seemed
to
consider
it
dispassionately
from
a
point
of
view
the
idea
which
had
so
startled
her
and
without
any
conscious
leading
up
to
it
on
her
own
part
was
nothing
less
than
in
the
guise
of
a
highwayman
to
stop
tew
when
on
his
way
back
to
arkrigg
and
despoil
him
of
the
will
when
a
young
spark
of
nineteen
or
twenty
dick
cortelyon
on
the
occasion
of
one
of
his
brief
visits
at
home
had
attended
a
fancy
ball
in
the
neighborhood
in
the
character
of
a
gentleman
of
the
road
in
the
wardrobe
in
his
room
upstairs
a
room
left
untouched
since
the
date
of
his
quarrel
with
his
father
the
dress
wig
mask
pistols
and
other
items
of
his
on
that
occasion
were
stored
to
the
present
day
a
fact
which
was
within
nell
cognizance
the
picture
of
her
cousin
masked
and
ready
to
set
out
for
the
ball
had
impressed
her
girlish
imagination
very
vividly
at
the
time
and
had
often
recurred
to
her
memory
since
and
this
recollection
it
must
have
been
acting
through
some
channel
which
while
asking
herself
despairingly
how
she
could
get
possession
of
the
will
had
inspired
her
with
the
idea
of
turning
highwayman
in
reality
for
one
night
only
we
know
at
what
decision
she
arrived
instead
of
scouting
the
idea
and
casting
it
from
her
as
young
women
out
of
every
hundred
would
have
done
she
determined
que
to
put
it
to
a
practical
issue
whatever
risks
might
be
connected
with
or
follow
on
the
affair
she
was
prepared
to
face
if
only
she
could
thereby
insure
the
destruction
of
her
uncle
iniquitous
will
fortunately
for
her
when
she
came
to
consider
several
things
seemed
to
work
in
favor
of
her
scheme
desperate
as
at
first
sight
it
had
appeared
in
the
first
place
everything
in
the
way
of
dress
and
accessories
needful
for
the
part
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
play
were
there
ready
to
her
hand
in
the
second
john
dyce
who
was
to
act
as
her
escort
had
known
her
from
childhood
was
devoted
to
her
and
could
be
thoroughly
depended
upon
to
keep
any
secret
she
might
think
well
to
entrust
him
with
in
point
of
fact
john
had
originally
been
one
of
her
father
servants
and
he
it
was
who
had
brought
her
a
girl
of
twelve
to
stanbrook
where
he
had
remained
ever
since
filling
the
part
of
in
the
squire
establishment
then
again
it
was
a
good
thing
so
far
as
her
purpose
was
concerned
that
a
married
cousin
of
john
should
be
keeper
of
the
first
on
the
whinbarrow
road
which
was
the
road
she
would
have
to
journey
by
on
her
errand
to
delafosse
for
the
last
time
she
asked
herself
shall
i
adventure
it
or
shall
i
not
knowing
all
the
while
what
the
answer
would
be
by
now
the
afternoon
was
so
far
advanced
that
she
must
no
longer
delay
her
preparations
she
knew
already
that
tew
would
not
set
off
on
his
return
journey
till
dinner
should
be
well
over
she
herself
would
start
in
the
early
dusk
about
an
hour
in
advance
of
him
she
made
it
her
first
business
to
see
john
dyce
and
have
a
little
private
talk
with
him
next
she
invented
an
errand
for
her
maid
to
a
neighboring
village
which
would
keep
that
elderly
damsel
out
of
the
way
till
after
her
own
departure
next
came
one
of
the
most
essential
features
of
the
programme
she
was
bent
on
carrying
out
the
transformation
of
miss
baynard
into
the
guise
of
a
young
man
the
change
was
affected
in
due
course
and
a
very
handsome
and
dashing
young
blade
she
looked
she
took
a
long
survey
of
herself
in
the
cheval
glass
blushing
and
smiling
as
she
did
so
nell
was
a
tall
young
woman
and
as
her
cousin
dick
had
been
a
somewhat
slender
young
fellow
his
clothes
fitted
her
almost
as
if
they
had
been
made
for
her
but
servants
have
prying
eyes
and
not
thus
would
it
do
for
her
to
be
seen
leaving
the
house
besides
there
was
the
risk
of
encountering
some
one
in
the
village
to
whom
her
face
was
known
so
over
her
dress
she
now
proceeded
to
put
on
certain
articles
of
feminine
attire
to
wit
a
long
and
a
mantle
with
a
hood
to
it
the
latter
of
which
she
drew
over
her
head
it
was
a
common
enough
costume
for
ladies
travelling
on
horseback
into
a
couple
of
which
john
dyce
had
supplied
her
with
she
had
already
stowed
away
a
number
of
things
then
when
all
was
ready
she
went
down
by
way
of
the
back
staircase
and
so
out
of
the
house
unseen
by
any
one
save
a
gaping
kitchen
wench
in
the
court
near
the
stables
were
two
horses
in
readiness
one
of
them
being
her
mare
peggy
a
birthday
gift
two
years
before
from
her
godmother
lady
carradine
john
helped
her
into
the
saddle
then
mounted
his
own
horse
and
two
minutes
later
they
were
cantering
down
the
avenue
they
rode
through
the
village
and
so
on
their
way
for
a
couple
of
miles
or
more
till
they
reached
a
little
wooded
hollow
somewhat
removed
from
the
there
nell
having
doffed
her
riding
skirt
and
hooded
mantle
her
hair
having
been
previously
brushed
back
from
her
forehead
and
fashioned
into
a
queue
substituted
for
them
the
hat
worn
by
her
cousin
at
the
fancy
ball
with
by
way
of
overall
an
ample
riding
cloak
well
worn
which
poor
dick
had
been
used
to
travel
in
these
articles
she
produced
from
the
neither
was
the
mask
forgotten
although
she
had
never
seen
tew
before
that
day
and
then
only
for
a
few
minutes
it
would
not
do
to
leave
the
slightest
opening
for
his
recognition
of
her
in
the
part
she
was
bent
on
playing
john
meanwhile
had
been
changing
peggy
sidesaddle
for
an
ordinary
one
that
done
he
again
helped
her
to
mount
it
was
as
well
for
nell
in
her
new
character
that
her
mare
had
been
thoroughly
trained
and
that
she
was
a
fearless
horsewoman
whatever
awkwardness
or
embarrassment
she
might
feel
at
first
the
friendly
night
covered
up
but
presently
she
had
other
things
to
think
of
than
any
little
hot
and
cold
shivers
of
her
own
in
the
holsters
in
front
of
her
were
stuck
a
brace
of
unloaded
pistols
john
pistols
however
were
fully
charged
how
miss
baynard
sped
on
her
expedition
has
already
been
told
how
she
mistook
the
chaise
of
a
stranger
for
that
of
tew
how
she
was
fired
at
but
escaped
with
nothing
worse
than
a
fright
and
how
the
notorious
captain
nightshade
appeared
in
the
nick
of
time
and
acted
as
her
guide
as
far
as
rockmount
where
under
the
name
of
frank
nevill
that
of
a
cousin
in
india
she
was
made
welcome
and
found
shelter
for
the
night
we
left
her
just
after
housekeeper
had
shown
her
to
her
chamber
and
now
that
the
two
threads
of
our
narrative
have
been
brought
together
we
will
take
up
her
history
from
the
following
morning
when
frank
nevill
went
downstairs
he
found
an
excellent
breakfast
awaiting
him
in
the
same
room
into
which
he
had
been
shown
overnight
he
was
waited
upon
by
dobson
who
expressed
much
concern
at
the
smallness
of
his
appetite
when
the
meal
had
come
to
an
end
she
said
at
what
sir
would
you
like
your
horse
to
be
brought
round
as
soon
as
it
can
be
got
ready
for
i
am
anxious
to
get
on
my
way
in
ten
more
minutes
he
was
in
the
saddle
in
accordance
with
ellerslie
promise
a
on
horseback
was
in
readiness
to
show
him
the
way
as
far
as
the
whinbarrow
road
he
did
not
part
from
dobson
without
asking
her
to
convey
to
her
master
his
warmest
thanks
for
the
hospitality
which
had
been
extended
to
him
nor
did
he
forget
to
press
a
guinea
into
her
palm
reluctant
though
she
was
to
take
it
as
he
turned
away
from
the
house
he
gave
it
a
long
backward
look
it
was
a
domicile
plain
to
the
verge
of
ugliness
built
of
blocks
of
the
dark
gray
stone
of
the
country
its
walls
were
of
great
thickness
and
it
was
roofed
with
huge
slabs
of
slate
well
fitted
to
withstand
the
fierce
gales
which
assailed
it
during
the
winter
months
it
stood
alone
in
the
centre
of
a
great
plateau
of
stony
desolate
moorland
which
spread
away
on
every
side
till
it
was
lost
in
the
distance
no
other
homestead
or
sign
of
man
occupancy
or
vicinage
was
anywhere
visible
a
narrow
rutted
lane
originally
no
doubt
nothing
more
than
a
sheep
track
passed
close
by
it
seemingly
coming
from
nowhere
and
leading
to
nowhere
frank
nevill
shuddered
as
he
looked
what
must
it
be
like
he
asked
himself
to
live
there
in
winter
what
man
in
his
proper
senses
would
think
of
building
a
house
on
such
a
spot
and
yet
seemed
well
satisfied
to
live
there
after
traversing
the
lane
for
a
matter
of
three
or
four
miles
frank
and
his
conductor
emerged
on
one
of
the
great
highways
running
due
north
and
south
crossing
this
they
found
themselves
after
a
little
while
in
a
tangle
of
country
roads
among
which
a
stranger
would
infallibly
have
lost
himself
frank
guide
however
evidently
knew
every
foot
of
the
way
and
at
the
end
of
a
couple
of
hours
at
a
point
where
the
they
had
been
traversing
debouched
into
one
much
wider
he
pulled
up
his
horse
and
said
this
is
the
whinbarrow
road
sir
six
miles
straight
ahead
will
bring
you
to
dunthale
prior
do
you
wish
me
to
go
any
further
with
you
sir
they
were
almost
the
first
words
the
man
had
spoken
and
frank
as
in
honor
bound
had
refrained
from
putting
any
questions
to
him
he
now
dismissed
him
with
thanks
and
a
little
present
for
himself
twenty
minutes
later
he
drew
rein
and
dismounted
at
the
first
at
which
place
it
had
been
arranged
that
john
dyce
should
await
his
arrival
and
there
honest
john
was
and
a
glad
man
was
he
to
set
eyes
again
on
his
young
mistress
never
before
had
he
passed
so
wretched
a
night
fear
and
anxiety
had
rendered
him
half
crazy
and
had
put
all
thought
of
sleep
out
of
his
head
as
already
stated
the
keeper
of
the
was
a
cousin
of
john
dyce
and
nixon
his
wife
now
proceeded
to
show
nevill
into
a
neat
little
bedroom
it
was
the
last
time
that
young
gentleman
was
seen
by
mortal
eye
at
the
end
of
miss
baynard
stately
and
gracious
but
with
a
defiant
sparkle
in
her
eye
which
seemed
to
say
challenge
me
who
dare
issued
from
the
chamber
and
made
her
way
downstairs
miss
baynard
reached
dene
house
on
the
stroke
of
noon
where
she
was
warmly
welcomed
by
delafosse
and
his
wife
the
old
bibliophile
proved
to
be
quite
willing
to
exchange
his
gold
stater
of
epaticcus
for
the
rare
on
vellum
which
nell
had
brought
with
her
although
genuinely
grieved
to
receive
such
a
bad
account
of
his
old
friend
he
could
not
help
reminding
himself
that
there
were
several
rarities
in
cortelyon
collection
the
possession
of
which
he
had
long
envied
him
well
we
must
all
die
some
time
and
as
his
friend
collection
would
be
sure
to
come
to
the
hammer
there
would
at
length
be
a
possibility
of
his
becoming
the
owner
of
such
articles
as
he
especially
coveted
all
the
more
would
they
be
valued
by
him
for
having
been
the
property
of
a
man
he
so
highly
esteemed
after
joining
the
dene
house
family
over
their
three
dinner
miss
baynard
set
out
on
her
return
and
there
being
nothing
this
time
to
detain
her
on
the
road
stanbrook
was
reached
by
dusk
as
she
rode
up
the
avenue
she
glanced
anxiously
at
the
windows
had
the
squire
been
dead
the
blinds
would
have
been
drawn
down
but
there
was
no
change
in
the
usual
aspect
of
the
house
and
it
was
with
a
relieved
heart
that
she
dismounted
she
went
up
to
her
uncle
room
without
delay
when
told
that
he
had
more
than
once
asked
for
her
there
a
great
improvement
in
him
my
dear
budd
had
said
to
her
in
the
entrance
hall
banks
was
quite
struck
by
the
change
when
he
called
this
morning
nell
found
her
uncle
awake
his
eyes
met
hers
questioningly
as
she
entered
the
room
but
when
she
produced
the
coveted
coin
and
placed
it
in
his
hand
his
face
lighted
up
wonderfully
good
lass
good
lass
he
murmured
then
he
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
his
lean
fingers
closed
lovingly
over
the
stater
as
to
whether
miss
baynard
attempt
to
purloin
her
uncle
will
was
or
was
not
under
the
circumstances
morally
justifiable
the
writer
wishes
it
to
be
understood
that
the
point
is
one
with
which
he
considers
himself
in
nowise
concerned
his
duty
as
he
apprehends
it
is
simply
that
of
a
recorder
of
facts
without
taking
on
himself
either
to
justify
or
condemn
any
actions
good
bad
or
indifferent
on
the
part
of
his
characters
who
are
allowed
to
go
their
own
way
without
let
or
hindrance
and
as
we
all
have
to
do
must
accept
and
make
the
best
of
whatever
consequences
may
result
therefrom
chapter
xi
little
short
of
miraculous
yes
as
budd
had
told
miss
baynard
there
was
a
decided
change
for
the
better
in
cortelyon
condition
but
by
what
means
the
change
in
question
had
been
brought
about
was
known
to
three
people
only
the
sick
man
his
nurse
and
the
latter
son
cornelius
dinkel
had
gone
to
stanbrook
in
obedience
to
his
midnight
summons
taking
with
him
a
small
quantity
of
his
remedy
and
had
spent
an
hour
with
the
squire
unknown
to
any
of
the
household
he
was
a
tall
sallow
man
who
looked
as
if
all
the
juices
of
his
body
had
been
sucked
out
of
him
by
the
heat
of
a
tropical
climate
he
was
thirty
years
old
but
might
well
have
been
taken
for
a
man
of
nobody
would
have
ventured
to
call
him
handsome
but
his
expression
was
one
of
marked
intelligence
in
combination
with
considerable
and
great
tenacity
of
purpose
cortelyon
my
son
said
dinkel
as
she
introduced
the
young
doctor
into
the
sick
room
dinkel
bowed
gravely
the
squire
blinked
his
eyes
he
would
have
nodded
but
had
not
strength
to
do
so
then
he
said
speaking
in
a
thin
whisper
broken
by
frequent
gaspings
for
breath
your
mother
informs
me
that
you
have
brought
some
wonderful
discovery
back
home
with
you
and
she
would
fain
cozen
me
into
the
belief
that
by
means
of
it
you
can
succeed
in
prolonging
the
life
of
a
moribund
like
me
i
tell
you
at
once
that
i
do
believe
in
your
ability
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
no
damme
i
too
far
gone
for
any
of
that
sort
and
both
banks
and
mills
would
simply
dub
you
a
quack
for
your
pains
dinkel
face
remained
impassive
permit
me
cortelyon
he
said
and
with
that
he
proceeded
to
submit
the
other
to
a
brief
but
searching
examination
till
it
had
come
to
an
end
no
one
spoke
then
taking
up
a
position
on
the
hearth
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
speaking
in
the
tone
of
one
who
felt
himself
master
of
the
situation
he
broke
the
silence
your
case
cortelyon
i
find
to
be
exactly
such
as
my
mother
described
it
to
me
that
i
can
permanently
cure
you
i
at
once
admit
to
be
an
impossibility
you
are
too
advanced
in
life
and
your
constitution
is
too
nearly
worn
out
to
warrant
any
such
hope
but
that
i
can
succeed
in
prolonging
your
life
for
weeks
nay
it
may
well
be
for
several
months
to
come
i
make
no
manner
of
doubt
such
is
the
marvellous
efficacy
of
the
remedy
i
have
brought
back
with
me
from
abroad
this
to
a
man
who
had
every
reason
for
believing
that
a
few
more
hours
would
bring
the
end
was
news
indeed
weeks
perhaps
months
of
life
when
he
had
looked
forward
to
being
buried
about
a
week
hence
it
was
too
marvellous
to
credit
for
a
little
while
he
was
too
overcome
to
speak
then
he
murmured
and
dinkel
had
to
bend
over
him
in
order
to
catch
what
he
said
i
i
can
not
believe
it
i
can
not
nevertheless
cortelyon
i
am
not
dealing
in
romance
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
in
such
a
case
but
in
sober
fact
there
is
a
homely
proverb
which
affirms
that
the
proof
of
the
pudding
is
in
the
eating
i
have
brought
with
me
a
small
quantity
of
my
remedy
will
you
permit
me
to
administer
a
dose
of
it
to
you
again
there
was
a
space
of
silence
the
sick
man
gaze
was
bent
on
the
young
doctor
as
if
he
would
fain
read
him
through
and
through
while
his
grizzled
eyebrows
made
a
straight
line
across
his
forehead
he
liked
the
look
of
him
there
was
something
in
that
strong
earnest
plain
face
which
inspired
confidence
compared
with
him
banks
looked
like
an
amiable
old
woman
first
of
all
i
should
like
to
know
what
this
of
yours
is
compounded
of
he
murmured
after
a
time
dinkel
shrugged
his
shoulders
its
chief
constituent
is
the
dried
and
powdered
bark
of
the
tatao
tree
a
tree
indigenous
to
the
island
of
java
the
other
ingredients
consist
of
sundry
drugs
in
certain
fixed
proportions
the
secret
of
which
i
am
not
at
present
prepared
to
divulge
quite
right
quite
right
very
sensible
on
your
part
you
do
want
to
poison
me
i
suppose
hey
the
ghost
of
a
smile
flitted
across
dinkel
rugged
face
what
should
i
gain
by
that
sir
only
the
hangman
noose
i
think
you
ought
to
credit
me
with
a
desire
for
lengthening
your
days
not
for
shortening
them
it
would
puzzle
you
to
make
much
shorter
than
they
seem
likely
to
be
gasped
the
squire
with
a
painful
imitation
of
one
of
his
old
chuckles
well
well
he
resumed
i
venture
on
a
dose
of
this
stuff
of
yours
not
because
i
any
faith
in
it
mind
you
but
merely
to
take
the
out
of
you
and
prove
to
you
that
you
not
the
wonderfully
clever
fellow
you
inclined
to
crack
yourself
up
as
being
not
for
days
had
the
squire
spoken
so
much
in
so
short
a
time
and
as
the
last
words
died
from
off
his
lips
his
eyes
closed
and
he
sank
into
a
half
swoon
he
could
not
have
been
in
more
competent
hands
and
before
long
he
was
brought
back
to
consciousness
his
first
words
in
a
feeble
whisper
were
give
me
the
stuff
i
take
it
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
dinkel
extracted
a
tiny
phial
no
bigger
than
his
little
finger
about
full
of
a
fluid
which
he
proceeded
to
empty
into
a
dessert
spoon
you
wo
find
it
at
all
disagreeable
he
said
as
he
proffered
the
spoon
and
its
contents
to
the
squire
it
tastes
not
unlike
the
i
used
to
be
fond
of
when
a
lad
murmured
the
latter
half
a
minute
later
and
with
that
his
eyes
closed
again
dinkel
held
up
his
hand
and
for
a
little
space
neither
he
nor
his
mother
stirred
then
said
the
young
doctor
he
is
asleep
and
if
all
goes
well
as
i
have
every
reason
to
think
it
will
he
wo
awake
for
five
or
six
hours
i
will
go
now
and
return
between
six
and
seven
as
already
stated
banks
when
he
called
as
usual
in
the
course
of
next
forenoon
was
considerably
surprised
at
finding
such
a
decided
improvement
in
his
patient
condition
when
according
to
all
the
rules
and
regulations
of
medical
science
he
ought
to
have
been
nearly
if
not
quite
in
a
state
of
collapse
it
merely
a
flash
in
the
pan
the
sudden
of
a
candle
before
it
drops
into
darkness
he
said
to
himself
he
a
wonderful
old
fellow
and
evidently
underrated
the
strength
of
his
constitution
but
next
day
and
the
day
after
that
a
still
further
improvement
unmistakably
manifested
itself
banks
rubbed
his
nose
with
his
forefinger
and
was
clearly
nonplussed
on
the
fourth
morning
he
was
joined
by
mills
who
had
been
expecting
from
hour
to
hour
to
have
tidings
of
the
squire
demise
he
and
banks
did
not
fail
to
discuss
the
case
as
they
drove
over
to
stanbrook
in
the
latter
gig
but
neither
of
them
could
make
head
or
tail
of
it
and
certainly
it
was
difficult
for
them
to
believe
the
evidence
of
their
eyes
when
on
entering
their
patient
room
they
found
him
seated
in
his
propped
up
by
cushions
and
not
only
that
but
dictating
a
letter
in
a
firm
voice
to
his
secretary
andry
luce
he
favored
them
with
a
curt
nod
but
did
not
otherwise
notice
them
till
he
had
brought
his
dictation
to
an
end
then
turning
with
a
sardonic
smile
he
said
gentlemen
very
pleased
to
see
you
especially
you
mills
you
find
an
change
in
me
since
you
were
here
last
week
hey
it
all
your
friend
jimmy
doing
from
the
hour
he
changed
my
physic
now
four
or
five
days
since
i
began
to
mend
why
he
did
change
it
before
instead
of
letting
me
get
down
to
death
door
first
the
lord
only
knows
but
jimmy
always
was
a
wag
do
shake
your
pow
in
that
way
sir
you
know
i
speaking
the
truth
what
grand
weather
for
the
crops
we
are
having
just
now
i
told
that
both
my
corn
and
my
taties
are
coming
on
famously
but
i
hope
to
drive
round
in
a
day
or
two
and
see
them
for
myself
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
and
very
little
to
be
said
and
the
two
doctors
cut
their
visit
as
short
as
possible
said
mills
to
the
other
after
they
had
left
the
room
what
was
the
change
of
medicine
he
spoke
of
what
fresh
treatment
have
you
been
subjecting
him
to
to
none
at
all
i
give
you
my
word
i
am
sending
him
the
same
mixture
now
that
i
was
sending
him
three
weeks
ago
the
one
that
you
and
i
agreed
upon
no
single
ingredient
has
been
changed
in
saying
what
he
did
he
was
only
poking
fun
at
us
in
his
cynical
way
possibly
at
you
banks
but
certainly
not
at
me
rejoined
the
other
in
his
pompous
way
in
any
case
he
a
very
remarkable
old
man
and
although
i
could
not
quite
follow
you
in
thinking
that
his
vitality
was
at
such
a
low
ebb
as
you
seemed
to
make
out
i
certainly
did
not
credit
him
with
the
possession
of
the
marvellous
recuperative
powers
to
which
our
eyes
have
just
borne
testimony
humph
you
seem
to
be
blessed
with
a
very
short
memory
mills
your
own
words
on
the
occasion
of
your
last
visit
were
give
him
three
days
at
the
outside
and
that
just
a
week
ago
well
well
we
are
all
liable
to
err
of
course
still
i
afraid
that
i
allowed
my
judgment
to
be
in
some
measure
led
astray
by
your
diagnosis
i
ought
to
have
subjected
him
to
a
more
comprehensive
examination
than
seemed
to
be
necessary
at
the
time
for
all
that
i
can
not
deny
that
his
case
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
which
has
come
under
my
notice
in
short
i
should
hardly
be
going
too
far
if
i
were
to
term
his
recovery
however
temporary
it
may
be
little
short
of
miraculous
banks
grunted
he
was
too
indignant
to
reply
in
words
only
to
himself
he
said
i
always
set
you
down
in
my
own
mind
as
a
humbug
and
now
i
more
convinced
of
it
than
ever
as
the
reader
will
have
rightly
surmised
the
marvellous
change
in
squire
cortelyon
was
wholly
and
solely
due
to
the
drug
administered
to
him
by
cornelius
dinkel
already
as
we
have
seen
he
was
able
to
sit
up
although
only
for
a
short
hour
at
first
and
transact
business
and
each
day
brought
its
own
small
addition
of
strength
and
vital
power
soon
he
was
able
to
go
out
on
fine
days
for
a
drive
and
a
little
later
he
even
got
so
far
as
with
the
help
of
andry
luce
arm
to
take
short
strolls
about
the
grounds
but
this
eminently
satisfactory
state
of
things
could
only
be
maintained
on
one
condition
it
was
absolutely
essential
that
a
certain
regulated
dose
of
the
wonderful
drug
should
be
administered
to
the
patient
daily
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
this
arrangement
dinkel
made
a
point
of
coming
to
the
hall
every
evening
after
dark
bringing
the
day
dose
with
him
in
a
phial
he
simply
waited
long
enough
to
see
the
squire
swallow
it
and
then
went
his
way
dinkel
remained
at
stanbrook
nor
although
he
was
so
much
better
would
her
patient
listen
to
a
word
about
her
departure
perhaps
it
seemed
to
him
that
so
long
as
he
could
succeed
in
retaining
her
services
he
would
have
a
firmer
hold
on
those
of
her
son
besides
his
man
tatham
was
not
yet
able
to
resume
his
duties
so
interested
was
young
dinkel
in
the
case
of
cortelyon
that
for
the
present
he
made
up
his
mind
to
stay
where
he
was
as
his
mother
had
told
the
squire
the
object
of
his
life
now
was
to
take
his
discovery
to
london
and
build
up
a
fortune
on
the
strength
of
it
but
he
was
gifted
with
the
patience
slow
but
sure
of
his
father
race
and
was
content
to
wait
by
this
time
it
had
got
rumored
about
the
that
the
squire
amazing
recovery
was
due
to
dinkel
or
rather
to
the
effect
of
some
magic
compound
he
had
brought
with
him
from
abroad
further
it
was
commonly
reported
that
so
long
as
dinkel
continued
to
practise
his
arts
on
the
old
man
the
latter
would
not
or
could
not
die
among
others
the
whisper
went
that
the
squire
had
sold
himself
body
and
soul
to
the
young
doctor
on
condition
of
his
life
being
prolonged
till
he
was
a
hundred
these
rumors
were
not
lessened
by
dinkel
mode
of
life
he
had
fitted
up
an
old
shed
at
the
back
of
his
mother
cottage
and
there
he
conducted
his
experiments
flames
would
often
be
seen
issuing
from
its
chimney
after
dark
and
one
or
two
bolder
spirits
who
had
ventured
to
pry
upon
him
averred
that
they
had
seen
him
warming
his
hands
at
a
big
glass
jar
which
gave
off
blue
sparks
when
he
touched
it
evidently
he
was
a
man
to
be
both
shunned
and
feared
but
the
love
of
life
burns
strongly
in
us
not
merely
are
we
desirous
of
prolonging
our
own
existence
but
the
lives
of
those
dear
to
us
and
among
the
villagers
were
three
mothers
who
their
children
having
been
given
up
by
the
local
doctor
went
to
cornelius
dinkel
as
a
last
resource
and
prayed
him
with
tears
in
their
eyes
to
try
to
save
their
little
ones
he
did
try
and
in
two
cases
out
of
the
three
he
succeeded
still
the
country
people
with
their
ingrained
superstitious
prejudices
fought
shy
of
him
and
regarded
him
with
a
suspicion
that
was
largely
mixed
with
dislike
he
a
that
what
he
is
they
muttered
among
themselves
if
he
could
prolong
th
owd
squire
life
why
could
he
save

and
why
did
he
try
his
hand
on
old
tommy
binns
who
was
only
when
he
died
chapter
xii
a
startling
recognition
in
view
of
the
astonishing
and
wholly
unexpected
change
for
the
better
in
cortelyon
condition
it
became
manifest
to
miss
baynard
that
even
if
she
had
succeeded
in
despoiling
tew
of
the
will
her
doing
so
would
have
been
to
no
purpose
seeing
that
her
uncle
had
lived
long
enough
to
make
others
had
he
been
so
inclined
she
could
not
help
cherishing
a
faint
hope
that
now
a
fresh
lease
of
life
had
mercifully
been
granted
him
he
would
see
fit
to
change
his
mind
in
the
matter
of
his
grandson
and
either
by
means
of
a
codicil
to
his
present
will
or
the
of
a
new
will
repair
in
a
greater
or
lesser
degree
the
act
of
cruel
injustice
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
but
as
time
passed
on
nell
hope
faded
and
died
no
allusion
to
his
will
ever
passed
her
uncle
lips
or
she
would
have
heard
of
it
from
andry
luce
it
seemed
that
he
was
satisfied
to
let
it
stand
unchanged
one
day
a
brief
letter
from
her
godmother
lady
carradine
was
received
by
miss
baynard
her
ladyship
was
up
in
town
for
a
fortnight
her
usual
home
was
in
devonshire
and
she
wrote
very
pressingly
to
nell
to
join
her
there
during
her
stay
this
nell
was
by
no
means
loth
to
do
and
as
her
uncle
raised
no
objection
to
her
going
but
rather
urged
her
to
accept
the
invitation
she
and
her
maid
were
driven
over
to
lanchester
a
couple
of
days
later
where
she
booked
two
inside
places
in
the
london
mail
nell
was
especially
glad
to
find
herself
again
in
london
because
she
would
now
be
enabled
to
renew
her
acquaintance
with
young
evan
whom
she
had
not
seen
since
his
mother
death
but
before
going
to
lawn
cottage
where
so
far
as
she
was
aware
the
boy
was
still
domiciled
she
deemed
it
advisable
to
call
upon
mcmanus
whom
she
found
in
nowise
changed
but
still
as
genial
as
and
as
snuffy
as
ever
yes
he
said
in
answer
to
a
question
after
he
had
ushered
his
visitor
into
a
little
parlor
behind
the
shop
the
young
shaver
is
quite
well
and
hearty
or
was
so
a
week
since
and
is
still
in
charge
of
mrs
mardin
and
all
the
expenses
in
connection
with
him
are
still
defrayed
by
mr
dare
in
that
respect
nothing
is
changed
i
may
however
just
mention
that
some
time
ago
a
report
reached
me
although
mind
you
miss
i
tell
how
true
it
was
that
between
two
and
three
years
ago
dare
came
to
the
end
of
his
tether
was
ruined
in
point
of
fact
no
doubt
gambling
had
to
do
with
it
and
had
to
give
up
all
his
fine
acquaintances
and
leave
london
but
be
that
as
it
may
i
have
it
from
mardin
lips
that
the
quarter
money
for
young
evan
is
always
punctually
remitted
he
one
of
those
gentlemen
is
dare
whose
word
is
his
bond
i
wish
all
gentlemen
were
like
him
the
old
man
paused
to
refresh
himself
with
a
pinch
of
his
favorite
mixture
and
then
went
on
i
myself
on
a
fine
sunday
afternoon
sometimes
manage
to
get
as
far
as
chelsea
in
order
to
satisfy
myself
as
to
how
the
boy
is
getting
on
although
mardin
knows
me
for
his
on
the
side
that
fact
at
my
request
has
been
kept
a
secret
from
evan
from
the
first
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
not
spoil
any
chance
the
boy
might
have
of
one
day
being
acknowledged
by
his
father
relations
by
putting
my
humble
self
in
the
way
and
when
you
entered
the
shop
just
now
miss
i
was
in
hopes
you
had
come
to
tell
me
that
cortelyon
had
changed
his
mind
at
last
and
had
sent
you
to
fetch
his
grandson
nell
shook
her
head
sadly
i
am
afraid
there
is
no
present
likelihood
of
my
uncle
doing
anything
of
the
kind
up
till
now
his
feelings
in
the
matter
have
undergone
no
change
and
maybe
he
will
go
down
to
the
grave
without
having
known
how
sweet
it
is
to
forgive
poor
old
gentleman
how
i
pity
him
an
hour
later
nell
despatched
a
note
to
mardin
telling
her
that
she
hoped
to
be
at
lawn
cottage
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
of
next
day
and
there
the
specified
time
found
her
evan
had
by
no
means
forgotten
his
aunt
nell
and
she
was
made
very
glad
thereby
but
she
had
sent
him
so
many
presents
of
toys
and
other
things
from
time
to
time
that
it
would
have
been
odd
if
he
had
not
remembered
her
to
her
he
seemed
to
have
grown
more
like
his
father
than
ever
if
his
grandfather
would
but
once
have
admitted
the
lad
to
his
presence
surely
his
hard
heart
would
have
softened
at
haunting
likeness
to
the
dead
man
but
as
the
old
tobacconist
had
said
he
would
go
down
to
the
grave
without
having
known
how
sweet
it
is
to
forgive
mardin
was
nothing
if
not
hospitable
and
before
long
tea
was
served
nor
were
the
toothsome
buns
for
which
chelsea
was
famed
forgotten
but
scarcely
had
the
first
cup
been
poured
out
before
mardin
rose
suddenly
to
her
feet
some
one
had
just
passed
the
window
and
next
moment
there
was
a
tug
at
the
bell
i
declare
if
here
is
mr
dare
exclaimed
the
widow
what
a
strange
thing
that
you
and
he
should
happen
to
come
on
the
same
day
and
with
that
she
hurried
out
of
the
room
miss
baynard
had
often
desired
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
this
unknown
benefactor
of
her
dead
kinsman
widow
and
child
and
now
her
wish
was
about
to
be
gratified
she
stood
up
as
the
door
opened
with
a
slightly
heightened
color
and
with
a
heart
that
beat
somewhat
faster
than
common
a
second
later
every
vestige
of
color
fled
her
face
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
her
limbs
were
on
the
point
of
giving
way
under
her
she
drew
one
long
gasping
breath
and
unconsciously
her
hand
gripped
the
back
of
her
chair
as
if
to
keep
herself
from
falling
in
the
man
who
now
entered
the
room
she
had
recognized
or
she
felt
nearly
sure
she
had
the
notorious
captain
nightshade
he
who
had
come
to
her
help
that
night
when
she
was
reeling
in
her
saddle
after
having
been
fired
at
by
the
unknown
traveller
in
the
chaise
and
who
had
afterwards
acted
as
her
guide
as
far
as
rockmount
it
was
true
that
she
had
only
had
a
clear
view
of
his
face
for
a
few
brief
seconds
while
the
old
stood
at
the
open
door
with
his
lighted
candle
but
the
picture
thus
seen
had
burnt
itself
into
her
memory
as
few
things
had
ever
done
and
many
a
time
since
then
had
she
conjured
it
up
in
fancy
till
its
every
lineament
seemed
to
have
grown
familiar
to
her
and
now
marvel
of
marvels
here
before
her
a
living
reality
was
the
face
she
had
never
thought
to
see
again
long
and
brown
with
its
thin
nose
its
delicate
nostrils
its
black
brilliant
eyes
its
mobile
mouth
and
its
massive
rounded
chin
together
with
that
air
of
almost
defiant
recklessness
which
of
itself
would
have
served
to
mark
the
man
out
from
his
more
commonplace
fellows
and
which
seemed
to
sit
so
easily
upon
him
and
there
too
had
further
proof
been
needed
was
the
tiny
brown
mole
on
the
lower
half
of
the
left
side
of
his
face
which
had
caught
her
attention
at
the
time
as
a
might
have
done
on
the
cheek
of
one
of
her
own
sex
she
tightened
her
grip
on
the
back
of
the
chair
and
their
eyes
met
into
his
there
came
no
flicker
of
recognition
no
slightest
evidence
which
betrayed
any
consciousness
on
his
part
that
they
had
ever
met
before
his
glance
encountered
hers
with
the
clear
unwinking
steadfastness
of
one
stranger
regarding
another
his
features
were
grave
and
composed
there
was
no
start
of
surprise
the
sallow
of
his
cheeks
remained
untinged
by
any
faintest
flush
of
color
miss
baynard
was
bewildered
could
it
be
that
he
had
known
beforehand
whom
he
was
about
to
meet
and
had
schooled
himself
accordingly
but
this
was
a
question
nell
had
no
grounds
for
asking
herself
illustration
she
had
recognized
the
notorious
captain
nightshade
the
girl
perturbation
and
amazement
passed
unnoticed
by
mardin
whose
eyesight
was
no
longer
what
it
once
had
been
and
she
now
went
through
the
office
of
introducing
the
young
people
in
the
fewest
words
possible
miss
baynard
curtsied
a
little
which
was
not
like
her
dare
with
his
hat
pressed
to
his
heart
made
her
a
profound
bow
i
am
indeed
fortunate
in
finding
here
a
lady
whom
it
has
long
been
the
chief
desire
of
my
existence
to
have
the
felicity
of
meeting
such
a
speech
addressed
nowadays
by
a
young
man
to
a
young
woman
would
seem
and
rightly
so
absurdly
and
unreal
but
to
our
and
grandmothers
it
would
have
appeared
nothing
of
the
kind
they
and
their
progenitors
for
generations
had
brought
the
art
of
compliment
especially
as
between
the
sexes
to
a
degree
of
perfection
of
which
we
in
these
degenerate
times
retain
little
more
than
the
tradition
very
likely
it
was
all
very
artificial
and
insincere
but
the
fair
sex
of
a
day
which
now
seems
so
far
removed
not
only
expected
it
but
liked
it
if
we
have
been
brought
up
on
sugared
food
the
taste
for
it
generally
clings
to
us
through
life
if
any
doubt
had
lingered
in
miss
baynard
mind
with
regard
to
the
dual
personality
of
the
man
before
her
his
first
words
would
have
finally
dispelled
it
she
would
have
known
his
voice
among
a
thousand
how
many
times
since
she
first
heard
those
full
deep
tones
had
she
heard
them
again
in
her
dreams
she
would
have
blushed
to
tell
how
often
had
she
cared
or
been
able
to
count
them
yes
the
last
shred
of
amazed
doubt
was
gone
had
she
encountered
dare
in
the
dark
and
heard
him
speak
she
would
have
whispered
to
herself
that
is
the
voice
of
captain
nightshade
and
of
no
one
but
him
and
yet
he
had
not
recognized
her
but
perhaps
there
was
nothing
to
wonder
at
in
that
so
far
as
she
knew
he
had
had
no
opportunity
of
scanning
her
features
as
she
had
of
his
and
probably
had
no
curiosity
to
do
so
besides
which
he
had
been
unaware
of
her
sex
and
had
parted
from
her
as
one
man
parts
from
another
to
a
man
of
his
profession
the
adventure
of
that
night
would
seem
a
tame
little
episode
hardly
worth
the
trouble
of
remembering
she
was
glad
she
was
very
glad
that
he
had
failed
to
recognize
her
and
yet
being
of
the
sex
she
was
even
while
she
told
herself
so
she
felt
a
bitter
would
have
known
again
anywhere
and
under
any
disguise
but
she
put
this
thought
from
her
and
drew
a
breath
of
reviving
courage
her
blood
began
to
flow
again
and
soon
a
strange
gladness
for
which
she
could
not
account
began
to
make
itself
felt
at
her
heart
before
this
came
about
she
had
found
words
to
reply
to
dare
little
speech
and
i
on
my
part
dare
can
say
in
all
sincerity
that
i
am
very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
i
have
long
wanted
to
be
able
to
thank
you
for
your
generous
kindness
towards
both
the
dead
and
the
living
and
now
the
time
has
come
when
i
can
do
so
but
pray
let
us
be
seated
mardin
had
discreetly
withdrawn
she
was
sorry
that
all
the
good
tea
in
the
pot
would
be
spoiled
with
standing
but
such
little
mishaps
can
not
always
be
avoided
master
evan
was
in
the
garden
urging
on
his
wild
career
on
a
big
which
his
aunt
nell
had
sent
him
by
carrier
the
day
before
dick
cortelyon
and
i
were
very
dear
friends
miss
baynard
as
you
are
doubtless
aware
when
his
premature
death
left
those
he
loved
on
the
verge
of
destitution
was
it
not
the
place
of
him
he
had
honored
with
his
friendship
to
come
forward
and
shield
them
in
some
measure
at
least
from
the
chill
blasts
of
penury
this
it
has
been
my
privilege
to
be
able
to
do
was
but
little
very
little
and
had
our
places
been
reversed
i
feel
assured
that
dick
would
have
done
the
same
by
me
there
i
agree
with
you
but
such
friendships
are
rare
or
so
i
am
bidden
believe
for
all
you
have
done
in
the
past
dare
i
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
it
is
what
not
one
friend
out
of
a
hundred
would
have
done
but
from
his
charge
upon
your
generosity
must
cease
a
shade
of
perplexity
passed
across
dare
face
pardon
me
miss
baynard
if
i
fail
to
apprehend
your
meaning
what
i
mean
is
that
my
cousin
child
must
no
longer
be
a
burden
on
you
and
that
it
devolves
upon
those
to
whom
he
is
bound
by
the
ties
of
blood
to
care
henceforth
for
his
future
a
burden
miss
baynard
the
word
stabs
me
pardon
me
i
was
wrong
it
ought
never
to
have
passed
my
lips
i
am
very
sorry
dare
bent
his
head
as
accepting
the
apology
and
indeed
for
once
nell
looked
almost
abject
from
your
remark
said
dare
i
can
only
conclude
that
cortelyon
hard
heart
has
at
length
relented
and
that
he
has
made
up
his
mind
to
acknowledge
his
grandson
nell
shook
her
head
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
nothing
of
the
kind
has
come
to
pass
my
uncle
is
still
as
much
embittered
against
the
boy
as
ever
he
was
excuse
me
but
you
spoke
of
those
to
whom
the
boy
is
bound
by
the
ties
of
blood
as
am
i
not
bound
to
evan
by
the
tie
of
blood
mr
dare
the
fact
is
one
which
can
not
be
disputed
then
you
wish
me
to
understand
he
paused
that
from
now
i
charge
myself
wholly
and
solely
with
evan
future
is
what
i
have
long
wished
nay
determined
to
do
but
till
you
and
i
have
never
met
the
last
words
had
hardly
passed
her
lips
before
a
quick
flush
mounted
to
her
cheeks
unthinkingly
she
had
given
utterance
to
an
untruth
they
two
met
before
although
he
seemed
to
be
wholly
unaware
of
the
fact
but
there
was
no
possibility
of
recalling
her
words
even
had
she
been
desirous
of
doing
so
and
and
consequently
i
have
had
no
opportunity
of
making
this
known
to
you
before
the
break
had
only
been
momentary
had
he
noticed
it
she
could
not
tell
dare
face
darkened
and
the
line
between
his
eyebrows
became
more
marked
i
was
certainly
not
prepared
for
this
he
replied
had
i
had
any
prevision
of
what
i
was
about
to
hear
much
as
i
value
my
introduction
to
miss
baynard
i
think
i
should
hardly
have
come
near
lawn
cottage
nell
eyes
struck
fire
and
for
a
moment
or
two
her
teeth
bit
into
her
underlip
but
when
she
spoke
it
was
with
no
trace
of
temper
that
was
a
very
rude
speech
on
your
part
dare
to
address
to
a
lady
but
under
the
circumstances
i
can
make
every
allowance
for
your
feelings
and
i
am
not
going
to
take
offence
at
it
the
one
thing
i
am
sorry
about
in
connection
with
this
affair
is
that
some
such
arrangement
was
not
come
to
long
ago
and
i
am
grieved
that
it
should
ever
be
come
to
it
will
cut
me
to
the
quick
i
tell
you
plainly
when
poor
dick
lay
on
his
deathbed
i
gave
him
my
word
that
while
i
had
a
crust
his
boy
should
not
want
and
that
i
would
do
my
best
to
make
up
to
him
for
that
stroke
of
which
was
about
to
rob
him
of
a
father
love
and
care
it
was
a
promise
which
as
far
as
the
exigencies
and
circumstances
of
my
life
would
allow
i
have
striven
to
fulfil
to
the
best
of
my
ability
that
life
my
life
is
a
very
lonely
one
how
lonely
you
can
not
conceive
and
in
the
course
of
time
my
dead
friend
son
has
grown
very
dear
to
me
yet
now
miss
baynard
you
would
come
between
us
how
cruel
in
some
things
is
your
sex
and
would
deprive
me
of
him
you
misapprehend
my
intentions
dare
i
have
no
wish
to
come
between
you
and
the
boy
in
any
way
you
will
have
full
freedom
to
visit
him
as
often
as
you
wish
all
i
say
is
that
henceforth
all
charges
in
connection
with
him
must
be
defrayed
by
me
dare
got
up
abruptly
crossed
to
the
window
stared
out
of
it
for
a
few
moments
and
then
went
back
to
his
seat
look
here
miss
baynard
he
said
why
should
not
you
and
i
come
to
a
compromise
in
this
matter
as
one
finds
it
advisable
to
do
in
so
many
of
the
affairs
of
life
suppose
we
share
the
expense
is
a
mere
bagatelle
after
all
come
now
what
say
you
miss
baynard
shook
her
head
it
can
not
be
dare
on
this
point
my
mind
is
finally
made
up
i
am
very
sorry
if
my
telling
you
so
causes
you
any
pain
or
annoyance
but
there
is
no
help
for
it
my
action
is
based
on
reasons
which
i
do
not
feel
at
liberty
to
explain
your
goodness
in
the
past
will
never
be
forgotten
by
me
and
i
trust
not
a
syllable
more
i
beg

with
a
queer
little
break
in
his
voice
my
forsooth
revile
me
strike
me
but
never
fling
that
word
at
me
again
as
applicable
to
anything
between
me
and
my
dead
friend
but
i
will
urge
you
no
longer
you
tell
me
your
mind
is
made
up
in
which
case
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said

done

love
the
conqueror
although
dare
had
not
succeeded
in
persuading
miss
baynard
to
reverse
or
modify
the
decision
she
had
come
to
in
the
case
of
her
child
and
although
he
was
at
no
pains
to
hide
his
chagrin
and
disappointment
he
and
she
did
not
fail
to
part
as
good
friends
are
in
the
habit
of
parting
neither
of
them
had
any
wish
to
part
otherwise
and
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
which
of
them
would
have
been
the
more
sorry
to
do
so
indeed
nell
was
unwilling
to
say
goodbye
till
she
had
obtained
from
him
an
address
that
of
a
lawyer
to
which
she
could
write
in
case
she
should
have
occasion
to
communicate
with
him
about
the
boy
both
of
them
put
the
selfsame
question
to
themselves
within
five
minutes
of
their
parting
when
and
where
if
ever
shall
we
meet
again
dare
went
direct
from
chelsea
to
holborn
miss
baynard
had
said
that
her
action
was
influenced
by
certain
reasons
which
she
did
not
feel
at
liberty
to
specify
was
one
of
those
reasons
based
on
the
fact
that
he
was
now
a
ruined
man
if
so
through
what
channel
had
the
information
reached
her
finding
mcmanus
as
usual
in
his
shop
dare
at
once
challenged
him
with
being
the
it
was
an
accusation
he
made
no
attempt
to
rebut
but
that
in
saying
what
he
had
to
miss
baynard
he
had
been
actuated
by
any
feeling
of
towards
dare
was
too
absurd
a
notion
to
be
entertained
for
one
moment
however
the
mischief
was
done
and
could
not
be
undone
and
with
all
his
faults
dare
was
not
the
man
to
vent
his
annoyance
on
so
helpless
an
object
as
the
old
tobacconist
but
miss
baynard
had
spoken
as
if
there
were
more
reasons
than
one
for
the
decision
she
had
arrived
at
might
not
another
and
perhaps
the
chief
one
lie
in
the
fact
that
in
him
she
had
recognized
the
man
who
had
been
mixed
up
with
herself
in
a
certain
memorable
adventure
and
who
when
asked
his
name
had
told
her
that
he
was
none
other
than
the
notorious
captain
nightshade
it
was
a
recognition
he
had
not
counted
on
being
unaware
how
incautiously
he
had
afforded
her
the
opportunity
of
scanning
his
features
by
the
light
of
the
candle
at
the
door
of
rockmount
but
that
she
had
recognized
him
was
an
indisputable
fact
was
it
then
to
be
wondered
at
that
she
should
refuse
in
such
positive
terms
to
permit
him
any
longer
to
defray
young
evan
expenses
with
money
which
she
doubtless
regarded
as
the
proceeds
of
robbery
on
the
king
highway
no
he
felt
bound
to
admit
that
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
and
that
in
point
of
fact
no
other
course
was
open
to
her
and
yet
knowing
him
now
to
be
that
which
he
had
told
her
he
was
she
had
parted
from
him
with
a
cordiality
in
which
he
felt
assured
there
was
no
she
had
given
him
her
hand
frankly
and
in
her
beautiful
eyes
he
had
read
nothing
but
kindliness
with
just
a
hint
of
sadness
or
so
he
fancied
shining
through
it
and
then
what
had
her
last
words
to
him
been
let
us
not
say
goodbye
but
and
this
to
the
man
who
had
confessed
to
being
captain
nightshade
but
to
attempt
to
follow
the
turnings
and
twistings
of
that
incomprehensible
thing
a
woman
mind
was
what
he
made
no
pretensions
to
doing
it
was
enough
for
him
that
her
own
lips
had
said
and
that
a
propitious
fate
in
its
own
good
time
would
bring
them
together
again
he
did
not
permit
himself
to
doubt
dare
had
had
no
thought
or
expectation
of
finding
miss
baynard
at
lawn
cottage
he
had
not
even
known
that
she
was
in
town
consequently
the
meeting
was
as
great
a
surprise
to
him
as
it
was
to
her
but
what
he
did
know
and
had
known
all
along
was
that
she
and
the
jack
prentice
were
one
and
the
same
person
so
piqued
had
his
curiosity
been
by
the
adventure
which
had
brought
them
together
after
such
a
strange
fashion
that
after
her
departure
from
rockmount
he
had
caused
a
watch
to
be
set
upon
her
movements
till
she
had
been
traced
back
to
stanbrook
that
she
should
prove
to
be
the
cousin
of
his
dead
friend
dick
cortelyon
was
merely
one
of
those
coincidences
such
as
people
who
habitually
keep
their
eyes
open
can
see
happening
around
them
every
day
dare
had
been
quite
right
in
his
surmise
as
to
the
reasons
which
had
actuated
nell
in
her
refusal
to
allow
him
to
contribute
any
longer
even
in
part
towards
the
cost
of
evan
maintenance
the
fact
that
he
was
a
ruined
man
would
of
itself
have
been
argument
sufficient
for
the
step
she
had
decided
upon
taking
but
when
in
addition
she
had
to
face
the
question
and
it
was
one
she
could
not
shirk
from
what
source
is
the
money
derived
which
is
remitted
every
to
mrs
mardin
she
felt
that
no
answer
was
needed
from
her
it
was
a
question
which
answered
itself
and
this
state
of
things
had
been
going
on
for
she
knew
not
how
long
not
another
day
must
it
last
she
had
only
been
a
couple
of
days
back
at
stanbrook
when
a
small
packet
reached
her
through
the
post
it
bore
the
london
postmark
and
was
addressed
in
a
writing
wholly
strange
to
her
she
opened
it
not
without
curiosity
to
find
that
all
it
contained
was
the
mask
worn
by
her
on
a
certain
occasion
she
had
been
unable
to
find
it
when
after
reaching
home
she
proceeded
to
replace
habiliments
in
the
closet
whence
she
had
disinterred
them
to
the
best
of
her
belief
she
had
inadvertently
left
it
behind
her
in
the
bedroom
at
rockmount
but
it
was
a
point
as
to
which
she
could
not
be
positive
anyhow
here
it
was
sent
back
to
her
by
an
unknown
hand
and
her
receipt
of
it
in
such
fashion
raised
more
than
one
perplexing
question
but
supposing
she
was
in
error
in
thinking
she
had
left
the
mask
at
rockmount
in
that
case
only
one
conclusion
was
open
to
her
that
it
was
not
ellerslie
but
dare
who
had
returned
it
one
or
the
other
of
them
it
must
be
if
dare
were
the
sender
of
it
how
woefully
in
error
she
must
have
been
in
assuming
that
he
had
not
recognized
her
when
they
met
accidentally
at
lawn
cottage
and
yet
by
not
so
much
as
the
flicker
of
an
eyelid
had
he
betrayed
any
knowledge
or
even
suspicion
of
their
ever
having
met
before
if
he
did
recognize
her
on
that
occasion
then
of
course
her
secret
the
secret
of
her
sex
was
equally
in
his
keeping
perhaps
he
had
known
or
guessed
it
from
the
first
had
he
not
when
she
reeled
and
all
but
swooned
in
the
saddle
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
had
she
not
with
wandering
senses
lain
for
a
little
while
a
very
little
while
in
his
embrace
was
it
then
he
made
the
discovery
supposing
it
to
have
been
made
at
all
hardly
had
she
asked
herself
the
question
before
a
delicious
thrill
went
through
her
from
crown
to
foot
and
all
the
pulses
of
her
being
began
to
palpitate
with
a
strange
new
sweet
life
far
sweeter
than
anything
she
had
hitherto
known
she
felt
as
a
chrysalis
may
feel
when
it
bursts
its
husk
and
first
spreads
its
wings
to
the
sun
she
sat
for
some
little
time
her
face
hidden
in
her
hands
although
she
was
alone
and
her
veins
aglow
with
something
that
almost
frightened
her
then
on
a
sudden
her
mood
changed
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
with
clenched
hands
and
face
took
to
pacing
her
room
from
end
to
end
doing
silent
battle
with
herself
meanwhile
never
had
she
been
so
assailed
before
and
she
brought
all
the
forces
of
her
womanly
pride
to
bear
on
the
insidious
foe
that
was
undermining
her
outworks
one
by
one
she
had
deemed
herself
invulnerable
she
had
as
it
were
set
herself
on
a
pedestal
as
a
being
apart
whom
the
one
great
weakness
of
her
sex
for
such
it
seemed
to
her
could
never
touch
and
now
nature
was
beginning
to
revenge
itself
by
proving
to
her
that
she
was
no
stronger
in
some
ways
than
the
weakest
of
her
weak
sisters
but
she
would
not
yield
she
would
not
give
way
she
told
herself
again
and
again
with
a
sort
of
fierce
despair
while
conscious
all
the
while
that
one
bastion
after
another
was
crumbling
before
the
enemy
assaults
shall
not
a
woman
remain
mistress
of
her
own
fate
she
cried
despairingly
in
some
things
she
shall
my
dear
nell
but
not
in
all
as
you
are
proving
to
your
cost
there
is
a
power
within
you
that
is
stronger
than
yourself
at
length
sick
and
weary
at
heart
she
cast
herself
on
her
bed
and
buried
her
face
in
the
pillows
never
never
will
i
submit
she
moaned
but
even
as
the
words
escaped
her
some
traitor
in
the
garrison
hauled
down
the
flag
which
had
flaunted
itself
so
defiantly
and
the
citadel
was
won
but
who
the
sender
of
the
mask
was
remained
as
much
a
mystery
as
before
chapter
xiv
a
fresh
actor
on
the
scene
except
in
a
few
occasional
instances
ambrose
cortelyon
who
prided
himself
on
his
possession
of
an
unbiassed
mind
was
not
in
the
habit
of
being
unreasonable
either
in
his
demands
or
his
expectations
whether
they
concerned
himself
or
others
thus
he
was
quite
aware
that
when
his
convalescence
so
to
call
it
had
reached
a
certain
point
and
made
no
advance
beyond
it
it
would
be
both
useless
and
unreasonable
on
his
part
to
look
for
any
although
dinkel
marvellous
drug
could
do
much
it
could
not
work
miracles
he
the
squire
must
not
only
be
content
but
must
deem
himself
one
of
the
most
fortunate
of
men
that
such
a
measure
of
health
had
been
given
back
to
him
as
was
now
his
and
henceforward
his
most
fervent
prayer
must
be
for
a
continuance
of
it
for
an
indefinite
time
to
come
dinkel
had
held
out
to
him
the
hope
nay
it
had
been
next
door
to
a
promise
of
a
prolongation
of
his
life
for
several
months
what
was
there
to
hinder
those
months
from
extending
themselves
to
years
he
himself
could
see
nothing
in
the
way
why
should
he
not
go
on
as
he
was
going
on
now
till
his
years
had
stretched
themselves
out
to
fourscore
of
course
he
was
only
living
a
as
it
were
it
was
existence
with
sadly
maimed
powers
but
only
on
such
terms
was
existence
possible
to
him
at
all
when
we
ca
have
what
we
would
the
only
wisdom
is
to
content
ourselves
with
what
we
have
he
was
quite
aware
of
his
utter
dependence
on
dinkel
but
on
that
score
he
had
no
fears
he
knew
that
the
young
doctor
meditated
a
removal
to
london
before
long
indeed
the
contingency
had
already
been
discussed
between
them
and
provided
for
week
by
week
dinkel
would
forward
to
his
mother
by
coach
a
small
packet
containing
seven
phials
the
contents
of
one
of
which
would
be
administered
to
the
squire
each
day
by
dinkel
whose
services
had
been
exclusively
secured
by
the
payment
of
a
wage
far
more
liberal
than
she
could
hope
to
obtain
elsewhere
dinkel
own
services
were
to
be
remunerated
at
the
rate
of
one
hundred
pounds
a
month
for
as
long
a
time
as
he
should
prove
successful
in
keeping
his
patient
in
the
land
of
the
living
under
these
circumstances
the
squire
could
bear
to
look
forward
to
dinkel
proximate
departure
with
tolerable
equanimity
banks
at
the
squire
request
still
kept
up
his
visits
to
the
hall
but
he
no
longer
came
daily
as
of
yore
at
each
visit
the
same
little
farce
which
each
knew
to
be
a
farce
was
enacted
between
him
and
his
patient
having
felt
the
latter
pulse
and
looked
at
his
tongue
banks
would
remark
in
his
inanely
amiable
way
we
are
going
on
famously
famously
strength
thoroughly
maintained
total
absence
of
febrile
symptoms
temperature
absolutely
normal
i
think
we
could
not
do
better
than
keep
on
with
the
old
medicine
of
course
we
could
banks
the
squire
would
respond
with
a
chuckle
it
wonderful
stuff
that
of
yours
send
another
pailful
along
as
soon
as
you
like
then
would
banks
take
his
departure
knowing
well
that
not
one
drop
of
his
medicine
would
be
swallowed
by
the
master
of
stanbrook
but
he
had
a
large
family
and
could
not
afford
to
quarrel
with
his
he
was
no
worse
than
the
majority
of
his
fellows
for
circumstances
make
humbugs
of
most
of
us
if
not
in
one
way
then
in
another
he
had
heard
all
that
common
report
had
to
tell
him
about
dinkel
and
about
the
magical
drug
he
had
brought
with
him
from
the
east
but
he
forebore
to
make
any
inquiries
of
his
own
into
the
matter
to
him
the
whole
thing
was
an
insoluble
mystery
but
for
all
that
there
was
one
consolatory
feature
connected
with
it
so
long
as
cortelyon
could
be
kept
alive
even
were
it
with
the
connivance
of
the
foul
fiend
himself
so
long
would
he
james
banks
continue
to
draw
a
certain
number
of
guineas
for
visits
paid
and
physic
supplied
although
the
one
might
be
nothing
more
than
a
solemn
farce
and
the
other
might
be
poured
down
the
kitchen
sink
to
himself
he
stigmatized
cornelius
dinkel
as
a
son
of
the
devil
but
what
about
the
hon
bullivant
all
this
time
after
that
last
interview
with
the
squire
she
had
waited
with
exemplary
patience
for
the
news
of
his
demise
he
was
a
dear
old
man
and
she
had
been
grieved
at
finding
him
so
near
to
death
door
but
all
these
things
are
ordained
by
providence
for
the
best
and
it
would
not
only
be
useless
but
wicked
to
rebel
against
them
of
course
under
the
circumstances
she
would
have
to
go
into
mourning
that
is
to
say
into
a
modified
kind
of
mourning
for
a
short
time
society
would
expect
it
of
her
when
the
dead
man
munificent
bequest
to
her
was
made
public
well
she
had
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
she
never
looked
better
than
she
did
in
mourning
dear
dear
cortelyon
still
the
expected
news
one
hardly
likes
to
term
it
the
news
failed
to
come
it
was
strange
it
was
very
strange
after
waiting
a
few
more
days
with
restrained
impatience
she
sent
one
of
her
servants
direct
to
the
hall
with
a
diplomatically
worded
message
having
reference
to
the
state
of
cortelyon
health
the
answer
he
brought
back
was
both
surprising
and
disconcerting
an
unexpected
change
had
manifested
itself
the
squire
was
very
much
better
and
the
improvement
seemed
likely
to
last
oh
i
am
so
glad
so
very
glad
said
bullivant
to
her
messenger
when
he
had
unburdened
himself
of
his
news
you
have
relieved
me
of
a
great
anxiety
so
the
improvement
seemed
likely
to
last
did
it
she
said
to
herself
but
that
was
sheer
nonsense
it
had
been
her
lot
to
see
a
good
deal
of
sickness
and
death
and
if
she
had
ever
seen
a
man
whose
hours
were
numbered
that
man
was
ambrose
cortelyon
the
improvement
as
to
the
nature
of
which
every
one
about
him
seemed
to
be
laboring
under
a
misapprehension
was
but
nature
expiring
effort
she
had
been
a
witness
of
such
things
before
for
a
few
brief
moments
the
lamp
would
flame
up
as
brightly
as
ever
it
had
done
and
then
would
come
sudden
darkness
it
was
with
an
easy
mind
that
she
set
out
next
day
for
london
where
some
law
business
connected
with
her
late
father
affairs
rendered
her
presence
imperatively
necessary
she
was
gone
six
weeks
during
the
whole
of
which
time
she
looked
morning
by
morning
to
receive
a
letter
containing
an
announcement
of
the
squire
demise
but
none
came
to
hand
it
was
both
unaccountable
and
disappointing
it
would
have
been
such
an
advantage
to
her
to
be
able
to
buy
her
mourning
in
town
she
journeyed
back
home
in
anything
but
a
pleasant
frame
of
mind
it
was
no
longer
dear
cortelyon
with
her
he
was
now
a
nasty
tiresome
old
man
who
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
to
be
so
long
on
this
occasion
bullivant
had
a
travelling
companion
in
the
person
of
her
captain
wilton
ferris
who
was
a
son
of
the
late
mrs
flood
by
her
first
husband
captain
ferris
who
had
sold
out
of
the
army
some
years
before
in
consequence
of
a
certain
scandal
with
which
his
name
was
prominently
mixed
up
was
a
handsome
but
man
of
forty
he
was
in
london
society
as
a
gambler
and
a
rake
who
had
been
at
more
than
one
club
in
his
time
he
had
gone
through
two
fortunes
his
own
and
his
wife
he
was
now
a
widower
without
family
and
for
the
last
few
years
had
been
reduced
to
living
by
such
wits
as
nature
had
endowed
him
with
but
at
length
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
his
tether
he
had
received
a
quiet
hint
that
his
presence
on
the
heath
at
newmarket
was
undesirable
men
looked
shyly
on
him
at
the
his
reputation
with
the
seemed
to
have
preceded
him
wherever
he
went
pigeons
worth
the
plucking
were
few
and
far
between
and
worse
than
all
a
bill
for
five
hundred
pounds
bearing
his
signature
would
fall
due
in
about
ten
weeks
time
his
failure
to
take
up
which
would
involve
nothing
less
than
social
ruin
such
ruin
as
was
still
possible
to
him
and
outlawry
his
strait
was
a
desperate
one
and
as
a
last
resource
he
had
come
to
his
in
the
hope
that
once
more
neither
for
the
first
nor
second
time
he
might
find
salvation
at
her
hands
bullivant
was
a
woman
of
tepid
affections
nature
had
made
her
so
and
she
could
not
help
herself
but
in
her
limited
and
narrow
way
she
had
always
cherished
a
fondness
for
her
handsome
scampish
her
own
had
been
of
the
most
kind
and
maybe
for
that
very
reason
she
liked
him
none
the
worse
on
account
of
his
faults
which
and
so
far
one
may
give
him
credit
he
never
strove
to
hide
from
her
in
point
of
fact
she
was
the
only
person
in
the
world
to
whom
he
ever
spoke
frankly
as
a
consequence
she
cherished
no
illusions
in
respect
of
him
she
knew
that
at
his
time
of
life
it
was
useless
to
look
for
any
radical
change
or
improvement
in
him
that
which
he
had
been
and
was
now
he
would
remain
till
the
end
he
had
told
her
all
about
the
damnable
fix
in
which
he
now
found
himself
and
if
she
did
not
sympathize
with
him
that
was
probably
because
it
was
not
in
her
nature
to
sympathize
with
any
one
on
the
other
hand
she
did
not
blame
him
as
so
many
people
in
her
place
would
have
done
for
the
reckless
folly
which
had
at
length
landed
him
in
such
an
but
if
she
did
not
sympathize
with
him
in
words
she
did
something
else
which
was
very
much
more
to
the
purpose
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
she
said
to
him
as
soon
as
ever
cortelyon
legacy
of
three
thousand
pounds
comes
into
my
hands
and
i
am
expecting
the
news
of
his
death
from
hour
to
hour
i
will
place
five
hundred
pounds
of
it
at
your
disposal
that
had
been
a
fortnight
ago
but
the
news
was
still
lacking
so
now
captain
ferris
was
journeying
down
to
uplands
with
his
sister
glad
enough
to
get
away
from
london
for
awhile
where
so
importunate
were
his
creditors
becoming
it
was
no
longer
safe
for
him
to
venture
out
of
his
lodgings
by
daylight
besides
at
uplands
he
would
be
on
the
spot
when
the
legacy
in
which
lay
his
only
hope
of
salvation
should
drop
into
his
sister
lap
at
this
time
it
so
happened
that
bullivant
was
not
in
a
position
to
supply
her
brother
out
of
her
own
resources
with
anything
approaching
the
sum
needed
to
help
him
out
of
his
difficulty
she
had
just
completed
the
purchase
of
a
considerable
slice
of
freehold
property
abutting
on
her
own
estate
and
for
the
present
her
balance
at
her
banker
might
be
said
to
be
down
to
zero
although
the
late
mr
flood
had
never
liked
his
stepson
and
after
his
wife
death
which
occurred
within
a
few
years
of
their
marriage
had
kept
him
at
as
much
as
possible
he
had
yet
felt
compelled
for
the
sake
of
appearances
to
invite
him
now
and
again
on
a
short
visit
to
uplands
so
that
the
captain
was
no
stranger
to
the
place
and
its
surroundings
no
sooner
was
breakfast
over
on
the
morning
after
the
arrival
of
himself
and
his
sister
than
he
set
out
on
foot
for
a
long
ramble
the
way
he
took
led
him
in
the
direction
of
stanbrook
and
when
he
reached
the
village
of
that
name
which
as
we
know
lay
within
a
bowshot
of
the
hall
he
marched
into
the
bar
parlor
of
the
white
hart
inn
and
called
for
a
bottle
of
the
best
sherry
the
house
could
furnish
such
an
order
was
attended
to
by
the
landlord
in
person
which
was
just
what
ferris
had
counted
on
after
they
had
chatted
together
for
a
few
minutes
about
the
weather
and
the
crops
there
was
nothing
out
of
the
common
in
the
captain
asking
the
worthy
boniface
to
join
him
over
a
glass
of
his
own
wine
a
second
glass
helped
to
loose
the
latter
tongue
after
which
the
rest
was
easy
they
gossiped
together
for
upwards
of
an
hour
before
ferris
went
his
way
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
seek
further
information
elsewhere
he
had
learnt
all
he
wanted
to
know
what
he
had
heard
impressed
him
greatly
nor
was
its
effect
less
marked
upon
his
sister
who
was
however
inclined
to
be
skeptical
with
regard
to
some
of
the
details
one
thing
was
evident
to
both
bullivant
must
go
to
stanbrook
on
the
morrow
and
ascertain
for
herself
how
matters
were
progressing
chapter
xv
fate
points
the
way
well
how
did
you
fare
how
much
longer
is
the
old
scoundrel
going
to
keep
beelzebub
out
of
his
own
these
questions
were
addressed
by
captain
ferris
to
his
sister
who
had
just
got
back
from
stanbrook
he
had
been
awaiting
her
return
with
impatience
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
had
been
gone
an
unconscionable
time
my
dear
wilton
i
wish
you
would
flurry
one
so
i
will
tell
you
all
there
is
to
tell
if
you
will
give
me
time
but
first
of
all
mix
me
a
little
having
taken
off
her
outdoor
things
inducted
her
feet
into
a
pair
of
roomy
and
planted
herself
in
her
favorite
bullivant
was
ready
to
begin
her
narrative
in
the
first
place
the
rumors
which
have
reached
us
from
various
quarters
about
cortelyon
amazing
recovery
are
not
a
bit
exaggerated
i
know
for
a
fact
that
at
the
time
i
saw
him
last
he
had
been
given
up
by
both
his
doctors
and
was
not
expected
to
last
the
week
out
if
i
ever
saw
a
man
with
death
in
his
face
it
seemed
to
me
he
was
that
man
when
i
left
him
i
bade
him
mentally
a
final
farewell
so
far
so
good
but
what
do
i
find
on
reaching
stanbrook
the
same
man
truly
and
yet
another
not
the
ambrose
cortelyon
whom
i
left
at
death
door
on
whose
face
i
saw
already
the
shadow
of
the
tomb
but
ambrose
cortelyon
as
i
remember
him
a
number
of
years
ago
for
him
time
dial
has
been
put
back
a
decade
can
you
wonder
if
for
a
few
moments
i
was
struck
dumb
with
astonishment
i
found
him
not
in
his
bedroom
but
in
his
library
and
how
do
you
think
he
was
engaged
why
in
drawing
up
with
the
help
of
his
secretary
a
catalogue
of
the
coins
and
medals
which
he
has
been
accumulating
for
the
last
forty
years
when
he
turned
to
greet
me
his
voice
was
as
firm
and
resonant
as
i
ever
remember
it
to
have
been
then
his
secretary
left
the
room
and
we
were
alone
he
held
out
a
lean
withered
hand
and
his
face
lighted
up
with
one
of
his
peculiar
smiles
when
cortelyon
smiles
you
never
can
be
sure
whether
he
is
smiling
with
you
at
you
or
merely
at
some
hidden
thought
of
his
own
onoria
he
began
have
been
expecting
a
visit
from
you
for
some
time
past
but
better
late
than
not
at
all
you
are
surprised
he
he
now
do
deny
it
i
can
read
your
face
like
a
book
at
finding
me
perched
here
and
busying
myself
with
my
favorite
trivialities
when
if
only
i
had
behaved
as
ordinary
mortals
are
wont
to
do
i
should
have
been
shouldered
to
my
last
abode
weeks
ago
and
you
would
have
been
a
considerably
richer
woman
than
you
are
well
well
nobody
can
be
more
surprised
than
i
but
why
do
you
sit
down
i
hate
to
have
people
standing
about
and
staring
at
me
what
i
said
in
reply
when
he
gave
me
a
chance
of
speaking
is
not
worth
repeating
as
a
matter
of
course
i
explained
how
i
had
been
called
from
home
and
did
not
get
back
till
yesterday
but
he
listened
without
seeming
to
hear
what
i
was
talking
about
evidently
he
was
busy
with
his
own
thoughts
his
next
words
had
reference
to
gavin
he
wanted
to
know
whether
the
boy
was
quite
well
when
assured
on
the
point
he
nodded
his
head
and
seemed
pleased
then
he
lay
back
in
his
chair
for
a
little
while
without
speaking
twiddling
between
his
fingers
as
if
he
loved
it
a
large
gold
coin
which
looked
as
if
it
might
have
been
minted
a
couple
of
thousand
years
ago
at
length
he
spoke
is
one
matter
onoria
about
which
i
wish
to
give
you
my
assurance
it
is
this
that
whether
i
die
or
not
for
five
years
to
come
my
will
as
it
now
stands
will
remain
unchanged
when
once
my
mind
is
made
up
it
is
made
up
for
good
i
never
go
back
from
my
decision
consequently
you
may
make
yourself
easy
on
that
point
you
know
already
that
neither
yourself
nor
your
son
has
been
forgotten
in
the
will
indeed
i
will
go
so
far
as
to
tell
you
this
that
there
is
perhaps
such
a
surprise
in
store
for
you
as
you
little
wot
of
and
now
let
us
talk
of
something
else
i
hear
the
browhead
property
is
likely
to
come
into
the
market
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
i
wish
you
would
drive
as
far
some
day
soon
look
over
it
and
let
me
know
what
you
think
of
it
nothing
more
passed
that
it
would
interest
you
to
be
told
about
and
before
long
i
took
my
leave
but
not
till
cortelyon
had
requested
me
to
visit
him
again
on
this
day
fortnight
and
take
gavin
with
me
captain
ferris
face
was
black
as
night
then
it
quite
evident
the
old
fox
has
made
up
his
mind
not
to
die
just
yet
he
said
and
yet
it
might
be
as
well
that
he
should
not
live
too
long
his
promise
about
the
will
may
be
taken
for
what
it
worth
invalids
and
i
suppose
cortelyon
may
be
counted
one
still
are
notoriously
changeable
and
any
day
may
see
your
hopes
dashed
to
the
ground
bullivant
looked
at
him
but
his
eyes
did
not
meet
hers
there
was
something
behind
his
words
but
she
was
not
quite
sure
what
it
was
of
course
i
fully
admit
between
you
and
me
that
it
would
be
a
great
relief
if
the
lord
were
to
see
fit
to
take
the
poor
man
to
himself
she
said
after
a
pause
but
what
can
i
do
in
a
case
of
this
sort
one
is
absolutely
helpless
the
captain
was
trimming
his
nails
and
did
not
reply
after
waiting
a
moment
or
two
his
sister
said
by
the
way
i
have
something
more
to
tell
you
as
i
was
driving
back
i
overtook
ann
thorpe
who
used
to
be
at
uplands
but
left
my
service
three
years
ago
to
enter
that
of
the
squire
i
know
her
for
a
talkative
young
woman
and
the
sight
of
her
supplied
me
with
an
idea
which
i
at
once
proceeded
to
put
into
practice
stopping
the
carriage
i
alighted
and
bade
trotter
drive
on
slowly
and
pick
me
up
at
the
then
i
joined
ann
and
we
walked
on
together
it
was
a
lonely
bit
of
road
and
there
was
nobody
to
observe
us
i
was
desirous
of
putting
certain
questions
to
her
which
no
one
but
an
inmate
of
the
hall
could
have
answered
to
my
satisfaction
with
the
questions
themselves
i
need
not
trouble
you
what
i
wanted
from
ann
was
a
confirmation
or
otherwise
of
the
all
but
incredible
news
you
picked
up
yesterday
with
reference
to
the
man
dinkel
and
his
doings
at
the
hall
what
you
had
heard
might
be
merely
one
of
those
idle
rumors
in
which
ignorant
folk
delight
but
which
they
are
never
at
the
trouble
to
sift
or
there
might
be
a
substratum
of
truth
in
it
but
so
overlaid
with
fiction
that
it
would
be
next
to
impossible
to
separate
the
two
strange
to
say
your
statement
was
confirmed
by
ann
thorpe
in
almost
every
particular
dinkel
the
mother
has
been
acting
as
nurse
to
the
squire
ever
since
tatham
his
had
to
resign
his
duties
on
account
of
and
it
was
she
who
introduced
her
son
at
the
hall
but
not
till
her
patient
had
been
given
up
by
his
doctors
and
was
hardly
expected
to
live
from
hour
to
hour
as
you
were
told
yesterday
this
young
dinkel
is
said
to
have
brought
with
him
a
marvellous
drug
from
the
far
east
which
will
almost
bring
dead
people
back
to
life
in
any
case
it
seems
certain
that
he
has
effected
several
remarkable
cures
in
the
village
and
neighborhood
and
from
the
date
of
his
first
visit
to
the
hall
the
squire
began
to
mend
it
appears
that
he
goes
there
every
evening
after
dark
taking
with
him
a
dose
of
his
wonderful
medicine
which
he
will
allow
no
one
to
administer
but
himself
i
have
told
you
already
how
changed
i
found
the
squire
from
what
he
was
when
i
saw
him
last
it
is
a
change
which
to
me
seems
little
less
than
miraculous
and
yet
so
far
as
can
be
gathered
it
is
wholly
due
to
the
man
dinkel
banks
who
has
attended
the
squire
for
years
keeps
on
sending
his
physic
as
usual
but
ann
thorpe
assures
me
that
the
bottles
are
never
as
much
as
uncorked
from
what
i
saw
myself
and
from
what
i
gathered
from
ann
it
seems
not
unlikely
that
the
squire
may
last
for
a
year
or
two
or
even
longer
but
life
is
made
up
of
crosses
and
however
much
one
may
try
to
convince
oneself
that
everything
is
ordered
for
the
best
it
is
sometimes
a
little
difficult
to
do
so
captain
ferris
shut
his
penknife
with
a
click
and
what
would
be
the
consequence
so
far
as
cortelyon
is
concerned
in
case
of
anything
happening
to
this
fellow
dinkel
he
asked
bullivant
lifted
her
eyebrows
really
my
dear
wilton
that
is
a
question
which
i
have
no
means
of
answering
for
all
that
it
is
one
which
might
be
worth
considering
he
got
up
stretched
himself
crossed
to
the
window
and
stood
staring
out
whistling
under
his
breath
his
sister
followed
him
with
her
eyes
she
could
read
between
the
lines
of
his
character
far
more
clearly
than
any
one
else
could
in
such
a
case
as
you
speak
of
i
should
think
it
would
be
a
very
bad
thing
for
cortelyon
she
said
after
a
pause
in
a
low
voice
my
own
opinion
exactly
he
made
answer
without
turning
round
the
days
followed
each
other
till
a
week
had
gone
by
and
captain
ferris
was
still
at
uplands
indeed
he
knew
of
nowhere
else
to
go
to
london
was
too
hot
to
hold
him
the
bailiffs
were
looking
for
him
high
and
low
here
at
any
rate
he
could
lie
by
for
awhile
but
not
for
long
hour
by
hour
the
day
was
creeping
nearer
when
the
fatal
bill
for
five
hundred
pounds
would
fall
due
after
that
not
even
uplands
would
be
safe
for
him
he
must
put
the
channel
between
himself
and
the
bloodhounds
of
the
law
illustration
the
body
of
the
had
been
found
shot
through
the
heart
little
further
allusion
was
made
either
by
his
sister
or
himself
to
the
subject
which
loomed
so
largely
in
the
thoughts
of
both
what
more
indeed
was
there
to
be
said
talk
for
talking
sake
was
what
neither
of
them
was
given
to
indulge
in
for
them
just
then
life
seemed
to
be
at
a
standstill
they
were
waiting
breathlessly
so
to
speak
for
the
tidings
which
still
delayed
their
coming
captain
ferris
was
out
and
about
a
great
deal
putting
a
discreet
question
here
and
eliciting
a
morsel
of
information
there
but
all
he
heard
pointed
to
an
unchanged
state
of
affairs
at
the
hall
any
fine
afternoon
cortelyon
might
be
seen
driving
about
the
country
roads
in
the
shabby
old
chariot
which
dated
from
his
grandfather
era
and
had
in
those
days
ranked
as
one
of
the
grandest
coaches
in
town
he
live
to
be
a
hundert
you
see
if
he
doa
sir
said
one
man
to
whom
the
captain
had
put
a
certain
question
ferris
turned
away
with
a
stifled
oath
it
was
on
the
afternoon
of
the
tenth
day
after
bullivant
return
from
london
that
some
startling
news
reached
uplands
it
was
brought
by
the
tuxford
carrier
who
retailed
it
as
a
to
the
maids
in
the
kitchen
whence
before
long
it
penetrated
to
the
the
body
of
the
cornelius
dinkel
had
been
found
early
that
morning
shot
through
the
heart
in
threeways
spinny
so
far
nobody
had
been
arrested
for
the
crime
bullivant
was
alone
in
the
when
her
maid
brought
her
the
news
gavin
had
lately
had
a
pony
given
him
and
his
uncle
had
taken
him
out
for
a
ride
on
it
a
sudden
vertigo
took
the
mistress
of
uplands
almost
before
her
maid
had
got
halfway
through
her
story
she
motioned
for
her
salts
and
for
a
few
moments
lay
back
in
her
chair
with
closed
eyes
and
white
face
then
presently
with
a
faint
better
you
can
go
she
dismissed
the
girl
it
was
not
the
news
itself
startling
though
it
was
which
had
had
such
an
effect
on
bullivant
it
was
a
horrible
suspicion
which
so
to
speak
had
gripped
her
by
the
throat
and
refused
to
loosen
its
hold
of
her
yesterday
evening
as
daylight
was
dying
into
dusk
her
brother
had
left
the
house
without
saying
either
where
he
was
going
or
when
he
might
be
looked
for
back
but
she
was
used
to
his
queer
moods
and
apparently
purposeless
comings
and
goings
and
found
it
best
to
question
him
as
little
as
possible
she
had
hardly
thought
to
see
anything
more
of
him
till
breakfast
time
next
morning
great
therefore
was
her
astonishment
when
on
crossing
the
hall
a
little
after
eleven
on
her
way
to
her
bedroom
she
suddenly
met
him
face
to
face
he
had
entered
the
house
by
a
side
door
which
could
be
opened
from
the
outside
without
disturbing
any
of
the
servants
that
he
was
both
surprised
and
disconcerted
by
the
meeting
he
showed
plainly
his
intention
having
apparently
been
to
reach
his
room
unseen
by
any
one
but
it
was
not
so
much
the
fact
of
coming
unexpectedly
on
her
brother
as
the
appearance
he
presented
that
caused
bullivant
to
start
back
with
a
low
cry
of
alarm
for
his
face
was
as
colorless
as
that
of
a
corpse
his
features
were
drawn
and
haggard
he
looked
at
her
with
eyes
which
she
did
not
recognize
as
his
so
strangely
changed
was
their
expression
he
was
bareheaded
and
his
black
hair
matted
with
sweat
was
all
in
disorder
while
his
chest
rose
and
fell
pantingly
like
that
of
one
who
had
outspent
himself
with
running
finally
both
his
boots
and
his
clothes
were
bespattered
with
mud
for
much
rain
had
fallen
in
the
course
of
the
day
great
heavens
wilton
what
ails
you
what
has
happened
to
you
cried
bullivant
for
god
sake
not
so
loud
such
an
adventure
he
panted
set
upon
by
two
ruffians
in
a
lonely
part
of
the
road
one
of
i
managed
to
knock
over
with
a
lefthander
then
took
to
my
heels
if
i
they
have
bludgeoned
my
brains
out
two
to
one
you
know
what
a
narrow
escape
for
you
but
what
has
become
of
your
hat
i
not
lost
it
have
i
he
gasped
while
a
great
terror
leapt
into
his
eyes
if
so
i
lost
too
a
moment
later
his
expression
changed
what
a
fool
i
am
he
exclaimed
with
a
ghastly
attempt
at
a
smile
i
got
it
all
the
while
it
fell
off
while
i
was
running
and
as
the
rascals
were
not
far
behind
me
i
made
a
dash
at
it
and
crammed
it
into
one
of
my
pockets
it
will
look
a
pretty
object
but
now
to
bed
for
i
shall
i
send
you
up
some
hot
water
and
curse
it
all
no
i
want
no
eye
but
yours
to
see
me
he
glared
at
her
for
a
moment
as
if
he
was
about
to
strike
her
then
with
a
shrug
and
a
sudden
dropping
of
his
hands
he
said
forgive
me
onny
i
not
myself
and
with
that
he
passed
her
and
went
swiftly
upstairs
and
presently
she
heard
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
of
his
room
it
was
the
recollection
of
this
scene
which
shook
her
with
such
a
terrible
fear
this
afternoon
what
had
her
brother
meant
by
saying
that
if
his
hat
were
lost
he
was
lost
too
supposing
he
had
lost
it
and
it
had
afterwards
been
found
what
then
and
why
had
he
been
so
anxious
that
no
eyes
save
hers
should
see
him
on
his
return
was
there
any
truth
in
the
story
of
his
encounter
with
the
two
men
but
above
all
had
he
had
any
hand
in
last
night
tragedy
that
he
was
utterly
unscrupulous
she
had
long
known
and
she
divined
without
knowing
that
in
his
nature
there
were
dark
unsounded
depths
in
which
the
most
ghastly
secret
might
be
hidden
up
forever
she
was
only
too
well
aware
by
what
desperate
reasons
her
brother
was
urged
to
wish
dinkel
out
of
the
way
to
him
it
might
and
most
likely
would
mean
all
the
difference
between
salvation
and
ruin
she
waited
his
coming
with
a
quaking
heart
she
was
sitting
in
a
mixed
light
that
of
the
dying
afternoon
and
that
thrown
out
by
the
glowing
embers
on
the
hearth
when
he
entered
the
room
having
shut
the
door
he
stood
there
with
the
handle
in
his
hand
without
advancing
well
have
you
heard
the
news
he
asked
abruptly
in
a
high
harsh
voice
very
different
from
his
usual
smooth
cultivated
tones
dead
shot
through
the
heart
last
night
presumably
when
on
his
way
back
from
stanbrook
body
found
early
this
morning
by
some
hedgers
on
their
way
to
work
what
will
happen
now
i
wonder
there
the
rub
both
for
you
and
me
i
had
already
heard
the
tuxford
carrier
brought
the
news
about
an
hour
ago
had
i
known
that
i
need
have
hurried
back
as
i
did
on
purpose
to
tell
you
but
no
matter
have
any
traces
of
the
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime
been
discovered
or
have
they
any
idea
where
to
look
for
him
my
soul
i
do
know
i
never
asked
was
a
point
that
had
no
interest
for
me
but
now
i
go
upstairs
and
make
myself
presentable
and
join
you
presently
over
a
cup
of
tea
we
have
had
a
famous
scamper
the
boy
and
i
but
he
will
be
with
you
in
a
minute
or
two
after
tea
they
played
ecarté
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
never
had
bullivant
seen
her
brother
more
cheerful
and
at
his
ease
she
went
to
bed
not
knowing
what
to
think
chapter
xvi
the
shears
of
atropos
the
news
of
the
tragedy
in
threeways
spinny
reached
stanbrook
about
nine
in
the
morning
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
had
already
been
taken
home
and
it
was
dinkel
neighbor
who
was
deputed
to
convey
the
sad
tidings
to
her
she
was
on
the
point
of
taking
the
squire
breakfast
upstairs
when
the
man
arrived
at
the
hall
and
asked
to
see
her
ten
minutes
later
dinkel
entered
her
patient
room
like
the
thoughtful
creature
she
was
even
in
the
midst
of
her
distress
she
had
not
forgotten
the
breakfast
tray
having
placed
it
on
the
table
by
the
bedside
she
turned
to
the
squire
and
in
a
voice
which
not
all
her
efforts
could
render
firm
said
sir
a
great
misfortune
has
befallen
me
the
most
terrible
that
could
have
happened
my
son
has
been
murdered
the
tidings
have
just
reached
me
his
body
was
found
early
this
morning
in
threeways
spinny
he
had
been
shot
through
the
heart
he
who
had
not
an
enemy
in
the
world
sir
i
must
leave
here
at
once
i
am
wanted
at
home
as
you
can
well
conceive
but
if
dead
your
son
dead
shrieked
the
squire
almost
as
shrilly
as
a
woman
might
have
done
then
for
a
few
seconds
he
remained
speechless
his
heart
stopped
beating
and
a
black
veil
dropped
before
his
eyes
but
the
very
force
of
the
shock
brought
its
own
reaction
he
flung
up
his
arms
and
then
let
them
drop
helplessly
on
the
bed
in
that
case
what
is
to
become
of
me
he
moaned
the
lord
in
heaven
only
knows
sir
for
i
sure
i
do
answered
dinkel
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
crush
down
her
emotion
the
squire
sank
back
on
his
pillow
with
a
groan
the
bereaved
mother
stood
looking
at
him
anxious
to
go
and
yet
so
strong
was
the
professional
instinct
in
her
not
liking
to
leave
him
of
a
sudden
he
beckoned
her
to
go
closer
to
him
and
when
she
had
done
so
he
clutched
her
by
the
sleeve
of
her
gown
in
three
short
minutes
his
face
seemed
to
have
aged
a
dozen
years
his
lips
had
turned
of
a
grayish
purple
and
a
thin
froth
had
gathered
at
their
corners
his
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
a
soul
brought
to
bay
and
yet
ready
to
turn
and
curse
with
its
latest
breath
the
inexorable
fate
which
had
driven
it
there
do
think
i
do
not
pity
you
because
that
would
be
a
mistake
on
your
part
he
said
i
pity
you
and
sympathize
with
you
most
sincerely
but
but
your
son
must
have
left
a
lot
of
the
drug
you
know
what
i
mean
behind
him
do
you
think
so
hey
and
and
as
soon
as
ever
you
can
spare
time
in
the
course
of
the
day
you
know
you
will
have
a
thorough
search
made
and
ascertain
the
quantity
and
let
me
know
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
wo
you
yes
yes
he
must
have
left
quite
a
considerable
quantity
ready
prepared
i
feel
sure
of
it
so
do
forget
to
send
me
word
as
soon
as
you
can
there
was
a
terrible
eagerness
in
the
way
he
spoke
and
he
would
not
loose
his
hold
of
her
till
she
had
promised
him
that
he
should
hear
from
her
in
the
course
of
the
forenoon
when
she
was
gone
her
place
was
taken
by
miss
baynard
that
morning
the
squire
breakfast
was
sent
away
untasted
and
he
made
no
effort
to
get
up
anxiety
held
him
as
with
a
vise
an
anxiety
shot
through
and
through
with
forebodings
the
most
dire
he
lay
without
speaking
watching
with
feverish
eyes
the
fingers
of
the
clock
on
the
each
of
whose
solemn
ticks
seemed
to
him
to
mark
a
stitch
in
the
tapestry
of
doom
it
was
a
few
minutes
past
two
when
a
servant
brought
upstairs
a
small
sealed
packet
together
with
a
letter
both
of
them
addressed
to
ambrose
cortelyon
and
both
of
them
just
brought
by
a
special
messenger
the
sick
man
had
no
need
to
ask
who
was
the
sender
open
the
letter
and
read
it
aloud
nell
he
said
as
soon
as
the
servant
had
left
the
room
it
was
not
merely
that
he
had
lost
the
control
of
his
fingers
he
shook
from
head
to
foot
like
one
in
an
ague
fit
nell
did
as
she
was
bidden
honored
sir
she
read
in
accordance
with
your
wish
and
my
own
promise
i
have
made
diligent
and
careful
search
in
every
corner
cupboard
and
drawer
of
the
room
in
which
my
poor
son
mixed
his
physics
and
attended
to
his
doctoring
business
with
the
result
and
it
grieves
me
much
to
have
to
tell
it
you
that
i
have
not
succeeded
in
finding
more
than
two
phials
of
the
stuff
ready
mixed
for
taking
the
which
under
cover
i
herewith
send
you
it
would
appear
to
have
been
my
son
custom
not
to
prepare
any
large
quantity
of
the
drug
beforehand
perhaps
but
on
this
point
i
speak
without
certainty
because
he
found
that
some
portion
of
its
virtue
was
lost
with
keeping
i
remain
honored
sir
your
obedient
humble
servant
martha
dinkel
since
writing
the
above
i
have
made
another
thorough
search
high
and
low
in
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
premises
but
it
has
proved
a
sheer
waste
of
time
cortelyon
sir
in
the
midst
of
my
own
distress
permit
me
respectfully
to
observe
that
my
heart
bleeds
for
you
when
nell
had
read
to
the
last
word
the
squire
made
no
comment
aloud
only
to
himself
he
murmured
ultima
linea
rerum
he
had
not
opened
his
horace
for
years
but
the
line
came
back
to
him
quite
freshly
he
knew
that
he
was
a
doomed
man
and
that
no
earthly
power
could
save
him
well
according
to
all
human
calculations
he
ought
to
have
been
dead
and
buried
a
number
of
weeks
ago
but
another
brief
spell
of
life
had
been
granted
him
and
if
through
a
tragic
misfortune
which
no
one
could
have
foreseen
it
had
come
prematurely
to
a
close
why
there
was
no
help
for
it
all
that
was
now
left
him
to
do
was
to
wrap
his
toga
about
him
and
await
the
end
with
silent
stoicism
although
he
took
the
two
remaining
doses
of
the
drug
in
due
course
he
made
no
attempt
to
rise
from
his
bed
after
hearing
of
dinkel
death
from
that
hour
life
with
its
manifold
interests
became
to
him
as
a
dead
letter
he
had
done
with
it
and
it
had
done
with
him
they
were
quits
so
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
he
lay
in
the
big
four
poster
silent
for
the
most
part
and
often
without
opening
his
eyes
for
hours
together
feeling
his
strength
ebbing
imperceptibly
away
and
between
his
fitful
snatches
of
sleep
thinking
ever
thinking
for
his
mind
remained
as
vigorous
and
lucid
as
ever
it
had
been
what
strange
and
awesome
thoughts
must
oftentimes
have
been
his
as
he
lay
there
in
grim
resolute
silence
waiting
for
his
order
of
release
his
niece
and
andry
luce
took
it
in
turns
to
watch
by
him
it
was
an
easy
task
there
was
so
little
that
he
wanted
or
that
could
be
done
for
him
miss
baynard
had
taken
it
on
herself
to
send
for
drs
banks
and
mills
who
responded
to
the
summons
in
all
haste
the
squire
opened
his
eyes
and
favored
them
with
one
of
his
sardonic
smiles
as
they
entered
the
room
come
to
see
the
last
of
your
handiwork
he
said
and
already
his
voice
had
sunk
to
a
very
kind
and
attentive
of
you
i
sure
and
besides
my
case
is
such
an
interesting
and
uncommon
one
it
will
be
something
for
you
to
wrangle
over
as
long
as
you
live
and
at
the
end
you
will
know
no
more
about
it
than
you
do
now
yes
yes
very
kind
and
attentive
of
you
but
as
for
your
physic
i
have
no
more
o
that
flat
throw
it
to
the
dogs
as
shakespeare
says
and
now
have
an
exposition
of
sleep
come
upon
me
of
course
they
could
do
nothing
and
to
miss
baynard
they
were
candid
enough
to
admit
as
much
it
was
a
sad
state
of
things
and
so
the
muffled
hours
stole
after
each
other
one
by
one
till
a
week
had
gone
by
by
which
time
it
became
evident
that
the
end
was
not
far
off
no
arrest
had
yet
been
made
in
connection
with
the
murder
of
cornelius
dinkel
and
it
may
here
be
added
that
none
ever
was
made
the
murderer
had
left
no
traces
behind
him
and
search
as
diligently
as
they
might
not
a
tittle
of
evidence
was
forthcoming
to
back
up
any
of
the
theories
propounded
by
the
authorities
in
relation
to
the
crime
on
a
certain
afternoon
somewhat
to
miss
baynard
surprise
bullivant
made
her
appearance
at
the
hall
it
was
a
step
which
she
had
not
taken
till
after
mature
consideration
the
first
few
days
after
dinkel
death
had
been
passed
by
her
in
a
fever
of
apprehension
precisely
what
it
was
that
she
feared
she
did
not
whisper
even
to
herself
but
she
could
not
bear
a
ring
or
a
knock
at
the
door
without
experiencing
a
spasm
of
silent
terror
yet
all
this
time
her
brother
remained
as
darkly
quiet
as
listless
and
apparently
as
indifferent
to
everything
save
his
own
little
comforts
as
she
ever
remembered
him
to
have
been
wet
or
fine
he
went
out
every
day
for
a
long
walk
and
it
was
he
who
brought
back
the
rumors
he
lighted
on
in
his
rambles
anent
the
squire
of
stanbrook
one
day
he
brought
back
something
which
was
more
than
a
rumor
it
was
something
he
had
been
told
at
as
having
emanated
from
no
less
an
authority
than
banks
cortelyon
was
at
death
door
and
this
time
there
was
no
possible
chance
of
his
recovery
then
it
was
that
bullivant
debated
with
her
brother
whether
she
ought
not
to
pay
one
more
visit
to
stanbrook
while
the
squire
was
able
to
recognize
her
captain
ferris
was
strongly
of
opinion
that
she
ought
on
no
account
to
omit
doing
so
there
was
no
knowing
what
influences
might
be
at
work
what
more
easy
than
to
persuade
a
dying
man
to
execute
a
codicil
to
his
will
or
even
to
have
a
fresh
will
drawn
up
cancelling
wholly
or
in
part
the
provisions
of
the
one
already
in
existence
most
certainly
she
ought
to
see
for
herself
how
the
land
lay
not
merely
in
her
own
interest
but
in
that
of
her
son
and
if
necessary
remain
on
the
spot
till
all
was
over
little
persuasion
was
needed
to
induce
bullivant
to
fall
in
with
her
brother
views
by
this
time
her
vague
unspoken
apprehensions
had
in
a
great
measure
subsided
dinkel
had
been
dead
more
than
a
week
and
nothing
had
happened
nothing
would
happen
now
she
told
herself
she
would
go
to
stanbrook
more
than
once
indeed
quite
a
number
of
times
when
talking
over
her
last
interview
with
cortelyon
her
brother
had
made
her
repeat
one
sentence
in
particular
which
the
squire
had
addressed
to
her
in
allusion
to
the
contents
of
his
will
there
is
perhaps
such
a
surprise
in
store
for
you
as
you
little
wot
of
to
both
her
and
the
captain
it
was
a
sentence
which
seemed
pregnant
with
golden
possibilities
and
it
is
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
that
on
her
way
to
stanbrook
her
imagination
built
up
more
than
one
gorgeous
aerial
fabric
although
as
a
rule
she
kept
that
arrant
in
the
most
complete
subjection
on
hearing
that
bullivant
had
arrived
miss
baynard
went
downstairs
to
receive
her
when
they
met
the
former
made
as
if
she
would
have
kissed
nell
but
the
girl
drew
back
a
little
haughtily
she
was
not
in
the
habit
of
being
kissed
even
by
those
of
her
own
sex
and
in
her
visitor
case
it
would
have
seemed
to
her
a
veritable
de
but
she
could
not
with
any
show
of
courtesy
refuse
her
hand
how
is
he
dear
miss
baynard
were
bullivant
first
words
she
spoke
in
hushed
tones
although
as
yet
she
had
got
no
farther
than
the
he
is
sinking
fast
and
is
almost
speechless
you
shock
me
more
than
i
can
say
and
to
do
her
justice
for
the
moment
she
looked
shocked
to
herself
she
said
if
he
is
speechless
or
nearly
so
it
is
too
late
for
him
to
think
of
altering
his
will
and
if
he
has
done
so
already
i
have
come
too
late
to
help
it
aloud
she
went
on
i
had
not
the
faintest
idea
that
his
illness
had
assumed
the
gravity
you
tell
me
it
has
news
percolates
to
us
so
slowly
at
uplands
otherwise
i
should
have
been
here
before
now
but
now
that
i
am
here
dear
miss
baynard
you
must
let
me
stay
with
you
till
the
end
cortelyon
as
you
are
probably
aware
regarded
me
with
a
very
special
affection
had
circumstances
turned
out
differently
i
should
have
been
his
but
my
life
has
been
one
long
disappointment
knowing
what
she
did
of
the
purport
of
her
uncle
will
nell
felt
that
little
as
she
liked
the
woman
she
was
not
in
a
position
to
object
to
her
presence
in
the
house
in
a
very
little
while
bullivant
would
be
mistress
of
stanbrook
and
of
everything
in
it
while
she
nell
would
be
little
better
than
an
outcast
but
however
bitter
and
humiliating
it
might
be
to
know
this
she
had
other
things
to
think
of
just
now
when
bullivant
and
nell
entered
the
sick
room
together
some
minutes
later
budd
who
had
been
keeping
watch
in
the
interim
rose
curtsied
to
the
newcomer
and
went
cortelyon
lay
with
closed
eyes
and
with
both
arms
extended
on
the
coverlet
one
shut
hand
held
the
coveted
stater
of
epaticcus
the
other
grasped
his
silver
an
involuntary
exclamation
escaped
bullivant
as
her
eyes
fell
on
his
face
once
before
she
had
believed
him
to
be
at
the
point
of
death
and
only
by
what
might
almost
be
termed
a
miracle
had
his
life
been
prolonged
this
time
no
miracle
would
intervene
his
hours
nay
his
very
minutes
were
numbered
death
awful
shadow
was
already
closing
round
him
would
he
live
through
the
night
about
half
an
hour
later
he
opened
his
eyes
turned
his
head
slightly
and
stared
about
him
bullivant
rose
crossed
on
tiptoe
to
the
bed
and
bent
over
him
dear
cortelyon
do
you
know
me
she
murmured
yes
i
am
sure
you
do
for
a
second
or
two
he
peered
up
into
her
face
with
contracted
lids
as
if
not
quite
sure
about
her
identity
then
with
an
inarticulate
noise
which
seemed
more
indicative
of
anger
and
repulsion
than
of
anything
else
he
raised
both
his
hands
and
pushed
her
rather
roughly
away
bullivant
went
back
to
her
chair
with
a
somewhat
heightened
color
in
her
cheeks
poor
dear
she
said
in
an
undertone
it
is
quite
evident
that
he
no
longer
knows
what
he
is
about
and
so
daylight
slid
slowly
into
dark
and
the
two
women
still
kept
watch
on
either
side
of
the
bed
banks
with
a
cheerful
fire
and
a
magnum
of
port
to
keep
him
company
sat
below
in
the
library
merely
for
form
sake
and
because
it
would
be
an
injustice
to
his
wife
and
family
not
to
make
his
bill
as
long
a
one
as
possible
while
the
chance
was
his
of
doing
so
for
some
hours
the
dying
man
skin
had
been
gradually
changing
color
till
now
it
had
become
of
one
uniform
leaden
blue
tint
banks
who
stepped
upstairs
for
a
couple
of
minutes
every
or
so
said
to
himself
that
it
must
be
one
of
the
effects
of
that
damned
drug
midnight
was
drawing
on
for
upwards
of
an
hour
cortelyon
had
been
lying
to
all
appearance
in
a
comatose
state
when
of
a
sudden
he
opened
his
eyes
and
raised
himself
in
bed
without
help
a
thing
he
had
not
done
for
days
past
the
will
the
will
get
it
and
destroy
it
before
it
too
late
he
cried
in
harsh
insistent
tones
punctuated
by
gasps
i
done
wrong
wrong
i
know
it
now
i
feel
it
to
my
grandson
all
all
to
that
woman
pointing
to
the
shocked
bullivant
nothing
send
at
once
not
a
minute
delay
piljoy
has
it
or
else
it
will
be
too
late
too
late
alas
it
was
already
too
late
he
sank
back
gasping
for
breath
with
eyes
that
were
already
beginning
to
glaze
five
minutes
later
all
was
over
bullivant
dabbed
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
poor
dear
i
am
so
thankful
he
did
not
suffer
much
she
said
that
he
should
wander
a
little
in
his
mind
at
the
last
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
nearly
all
aged
people
do
that
when
they
are
dying
chapter
xvii
an
astounding
discovery
it
was
five
days
later
the
funeral
was
over
everything
had
been
done
decently
and
in
order
and
in
the
great
at
stanbrook
the
shutters
of
which
of
late
years
had
been
rarely
opened
a
small
company
were
assembled
by
invitation
of
piljoy
to
hear
the
reading
of
the
dead
man
will
miss
baynard
and
budd
sat
together
on
one
of
the
couches
a
little
way
removed
in
stately
isolation
sat
bullivant
while
dace
the
housekeeper
remained
modestly
in
the
background
with
andry
luce
and
two
or
three
other
old
servants
to
keep
her
company
the
gentlemen
comprised
herries
the
vicar
delafosse
sir
james
dalrymple
of
langrig
and
squire
staniforth
of
claypool
the
two
latter
of
whom
at
cortelyon
request
had
agreed
to
act
as
trustees
under
his
will
they
were
thoroughly
practical
men
with
plenty
of
leisure
on
their
hands
and
as
such
had
recommended
themselves
to
the
late
squire
who
was
their
senior
by
more
than
a
score
years
and
had
known
their
fathers
before
them
piljoy
sat
by
himself
at
the
big
oval
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
the
will
as
yet
unopened
lay
there
in
front
of
him
when
everybody
had
settled
into
their
places
and
the
door
was
finally
shut
piljoy
cleared
his
voice
and
leaning
forward
a
little
with
his
clasped
hands
resting
on
the
table
said
addressing
the
company
at
large
before
breaking
the
seal
of
the
document
which
i
am
here
for
the
purpose
of
reading
to
you
i
may
just
remark
for
the
information
of
everybody
and
in
order
to
satisfy
any
curiosity
which
might
otherwise
be
felt
on
the
point
that
this
is
not
the
first
testament
drawn
up
by
me
for
the
late
cortelyon
there
was
a
much
earlier
will
the
provisions
of
which
i
need
scarcely
tell
you
were
of
a
widely
different
nature
from
those
of
the
present
one
but
that
will
was
destroyed
at
the
time
of
the
unhappy
quarrel
between
father
and
son
of
which
i
daresay
most
of
those
here
have
some
cognizance
for
the
next
few
years
no
will
of
any
kind
was
in
existence
nor
could
cortelyon
be
persuaded
into
making
another
till
he
found
himself
overtaken
by
illness
of
a
very
serious
kind
i
will
now
with
your
permission
proceed
to
open
and
read
the
will
sir
james
tapped
his
opened
it
offered
it
to
his
and
then
indulged
himself
with
a
large
pinch
the
servants
in
the
background
laid
their
heads
together
and
whispered
among
themselves
bullivant
tried
to
look
as
if
the
reading
was
a
matter
which
in
no
way
concerned
her
and
almost
succeeded
miss
baynard
and
andry
luce
alone
knew
what
was
coming
to
the
former
the
whole
proceeding
was
fraught
with
heartfelt
torture
from
which
she
would
fain
have
escaped
had
there
been
any
way
open
for
her
to
do
so
the
will
itself
was
enclosed
in
a
sheet
of
parchment
secured
with
two
large
black
seals
these
latter
piljoy
did
not
break
but
cut
round
them
with
his
penknife
and
got
at
the
contents
that
way
pushing
the
envelope
aside
he
proceeded
to
unfold
and
straighten
out
the
will
then
having
settled
his
spectacles
more
firmly
astride
his
nose
he
gave
a
preliminary
cough
and
turned
over
the
first
page
apparently
however
he
had
forgotten
to
how
many
pages
the
document
extended
and
in
order
to
satisfy
himself
on
the
point
before
beginning
to
read
he
turned
the
leaves
over
one
by
one
there
were
only
five
or
six
in
all
till
he
came
to
the
last
one
on
reaching
which
his
eye
instinctively
travelled
to
the
foot
of
it
next
instant
he
gave
a
start
and
sprang
to
his
feet
his
eyes
still
glued
to
the
bottom
of
the
will
he
looked
dazed
thunderstruck
and
well
he
might
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
he
cried
what
devilry
has
been
at
work
the
will
is
unsigned
and
so
indeed
it
proved
to
be
there
was
the
space
for
the
three
signatures
those
of
the
testator
and
the
two
witnesses
but
the
signatures
themselves
were
wanting
over
the
scene
that
ensued
we
need
not
linger
the
servants
were
told
that
they
were
no
longer
wanted
and
went
back
to
their
duties
terribly
crestfallen
the
legacies
on
which
they
had
so
surely
counted
seemed
to
have
dissolved
on
a
sudden
into
thin
air
for
the
first
few
minutes
after
the
fatal
announcement
bullivant
sat
like
an
image
of
stony
despair
so
stunned
was
she
that
for
the
time
being
she
seemed
deprived
of
the
power
of
coherent
thought
she
was
roused
in
part
at
least
by
some
words
addressed
by
sir
james
dalrymple
to
piljoy
of
course
the
will
as
it
stands
is
wholly
inoperative
still
staniforth
and
i
are
a
little
curious
with
regard
to
its
contents
so
perhaps
you
wo
mind
devoting
a
minute
or
two
to
our
enlightenment
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
read
out
the
different
clauses
all
we
want
is
to
be
made
acquainted
with
the
main
features
of
the
document
five
minutes
will
suffice
for
that
purpose
replied
the
lawyer
to
begin
with
there
are
some
bequests
varying
in
amount
to
as
many
old
servants
and
dependents
with
the
details
of
which
i
need
not
trouble
you
to
the
testator
old
friend
delafosse
bowing
to
that
gentleman
are
bequeathed
sundry
coins
medals
and
other
curios
a
list
of
which
will
be
found
among
the
private
papers
of
the
deceased
then
i
must
not
omit
to
mention
that
to
each
of
you
gentlemen
for
your
trouble
in
acting
as
trustees
is
left
the
sum
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
guineas
and
to
herries
a
similar
sum
for
distribution
among
the
deserving
poor
of
the
parish
with
regard
to
his
niece
miss
baynard
here
he
favored
nell
with
a
bow
the
testator
instructions
are
that
a
sum
of
money
be
invested
in
her
name
in
the
public
funds
sufficient
to
bring
her
in
an
annual
income
of
three
hundred
pounds
the
which
she
shall
enjoy
for
life
the
principal
at
her
demise
to
be
divided
among
certain
specified
charitable
institutions
to
the
hon
bullivant
a
bow
for
that
lady
is
left
the
sum
of
three
thousand
pounds
in
hard
cash
every
thing
else
of
which
the
testator
may
die
possessed
including
the
stanbrook
and
barrowmead
properties
another
large
estate
on
the
borders
of
yorkshire
and
certain
other
smaller
estates
is
willed
in
trust
to
gavin
bullivant
the
son
of
the
hon
bullivant
on
condition
that
on
coming
of
age
he
adds
to
his
present
cognomen
that
of
finally
i
may
mention
that
as
regards
the
stanbrook
property
bullivant
is
bequeathed
a
in
the
same
he
ceased
and
sir
james
and
his
friend
stared
at
each
other
in
sheer
amazement
but
in
bullivant
presence
they
could
not
well
give
expression
to
what
they
thought
staniforth
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
both
sir
james
and
i
were
under
the
impression
that
the
late
cortelyon
had
a
grandson
his
only
son
died
some
few
years
ago
did
he
not
leaving
behind
him
a
widow
and
one
child
he
did
and
yet
in
your
summary
of
the
contents
of
the
will
you
made
no
mention
of
either
of
their
names
the
widow
died
some
time
ago
there
was
no
mention
of
the
boy
name
on
my
part
for
the
very
good
reason
that
it
is
not
included
in
the
will
cortelyon
never
forgave
his
son
marriage
and
refused
in
any
way
to
acknowledge
his
grandchild
again
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
and
again
they
refrained
from
giving
expression
to
the
thoughts
at
work
within
them
then
said
sir
james
an
unsigned
will
is
so
much
waste
paper
in
case
no
other
will
duly
executed
should
turn
up
what
will
happen
only
one
thing
can
happen
the
case
will
resolve
itself
into
one
of
intestacy
and
everything
lock
stock
and
barrel
will
go
to
the
that
is
to
say
to
the
grandson
of
whom
mention
has
just
been
made
the
two
gentlemen
nodded
that
was
their
own
view
exactly
miss
baynard
had
sat
all
this
time
without
speaking
or
stirring
when
piljoy
made
the
startling
announcement
that
the
will
was
without
signature
she
flashed
a
look
at
andry
luce
which
seemed
to
ask
in
bewilderment
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
but
andry
nursing
his
chin
in
the
palm
of
one
hand
was
apparently
staring
straight
before
him
and
did
not
or
would
not
meet
her
eyes
when
however
dace
and
the
others
proceeded
to
leave
the
room
andry
who
was
about
to
follow
them
glanced
at
nell
and
in
obedience
to
a
signal
from
her
resumed
his
seat
nell
as
was
dumfounded
as
bullivant
by
the
turn
events
had
taken
she
had
not
clearly
comprehended
what
the
result
would
be
of
the
will
being
unsigned
till
she
heard
piljoy
declaration
that
in
the
event
of
no
other
will
being
found
everything
would
go
to
evan
as
his
grandfather
then
a
great
gladness
took
possession
of
her
and
her
heart
swelled
with
thankfulness
but
of
a
sudden
a
shiver
of
apprehension
ran
through
her
staniforth
was
speaking
have
you
any
reason
whatever
piljoy
for
supposing
that
any
other
will
than
this
unsigned
one
is
in
existence
not
miss
baynard
only
but
bullivant
as
well
awaited
the
lawyer
answer
with
strained
breathlessness
piljoy
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
sir
is
a
question
which
just
now
i
am
hardly
prepared
to
answer
and
for
this
reason
that
no
one
can
be
more
mystified
and
puzzled
by
the
turn
affairs
have
taken
this
afternoon
than
i
am
one
supposition
and
one
only
suggests
itself
to
me
as
tending
in
the
slightest
degree
to
elucidate
the
mystery
what
that
supposition
is
i
will
with
your
permission
now
proceed
to
explain
he
lay
back
in
the
big
library
chair
cleared
his
voice
and
toyed
with
his
spectacles
for
a
few
seconds
before
proceeding
in
accordance
with
cortelyon
instructions
his
will
was
drawn
up
by
me
in
duplicate
this
was
done
as
a
provision
of
safety
in
the
event
of
any
hitch
or
blunder
occurring
in
the
signing
or
witnessing
of
one
document
the
other
would
be
available
gout
having
laid
me
by
the
heels
i
gave
the
duplicate
wills
into
the
charge
of
tew
my
managing
clerk
who
was
just
as
competent
to
see
to
the
signing
and
witnessing
as
i
was
here
before
me
is
the
will
which
he
next
day
brought
back
and
handed
to
me
for
safe
custody
in
the
belief
that
it
had
been
duly
signed
and
witnessed
and
here
is
the
envelope
that
held
it
sealed
in
two
places
with
cortelyon
own
seal
and
with
the
words
cortelyon
his
will
written
across
the
face
of
it
with
his
own
pen
now
on
consideration
it
seems
to
me
just
possible
that
through
some
mischance
the
unsigned
will
got
substituted
for
the
signed
one
in
the
envelope
if
my
supposition
has
any
basis
of
fact
the
question
that
naturally
follows
is
what
became
of
the
duplicate
will
is
there
any
one
present
who
is
in
a
position
to
throw
any
light
on
the
point
involved
whether
consciously
or
unconsciously
as
he
asked
the
question
his
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
miss
baynard
the
eyes
of
every
one
there
followed
those
of
piljoy
nell
stood
up
her
cheeks
warmed
with
the
fine
glow
of
color
my
uncle
secretary
andry
luce
who
is
now
present
was
i
believe
in
the
room
when
the
will
was
signed
then
he
will
doubtless
be
willing
to
answer
to
the
best
of
his
ability
any
questions
we
may
think
well
to
put
to
him
turning
to
andry
nell
said
you
are
quite
willing
to
answer
any
questions
piljoy
or
these
other
gentlemen
may
ask
you
are
you
not
the
reply
was
two
vigorous
nods
in
the
affirmative
turning
to
sir
james
and
his
friend
nell
said
unfortunately
andry
is
dumb
and
has
been
so
from
his
youth
so
that
i
shall
have
to
translate
his
answers
for
you
come
a
bit
more
to
the
front
andry
there
a
good
fellow
said
piljoy
who
knew
him
of
old
then
he
seemed
to
consider
for
a
few
seconds
while
andry
changed
his
seat
you
were
in
the
room
when
the
will
was
signed
was
the
first
question
with
a
look
at
nell
his
fingers
spelled
out
the
answer
i
was
which
was
repeated
aloud
by
her
and
the
same
process
had
to
be
gone
through
in
the
case
of
all
his
answers
what
persons
were
in
the
room
at
the
time
besides
yourself
and
the
testator
tew
and
the
two
witnesses
peter
grice
the
groom
and
mike
denny
the
were
you
aware
that
tew
had
brought
two
wills
with
him
i
was
i
saw
both
of
them
on
entering
the
room
what
did
he
do
with
them
he
gave
them
both
to
the
squire
and
what
happened
next
the
squire
thrust
one
of
them
under
his
pillow
and
gave
the
other
back
to
tew
for
him
to
read
it
aloud
and
what
happened
when
the
reading
had
come
to
an
end
the
bell
rang
for
me
i
had
been
ordered
out
of
the
room
while
the
reading
took
place
and
on
entering
tew
told
me
that
the
squire
was
ready
for
the
witnesses
whom
i
had
been
careful
to
have
close
at
hand
so
that
there
should
be
no
delay
proceed
the
witnesses
were
brought
into
the
room
and
placed
where
they
could
see
all
that
went
forward
pen
and
ink
were
in
readiness
i
raised
the
squire
in
bed
he
was
too
weak
to
sit
up
without
help
and
supported
him
with
an
arm
round
his
waist
tew
placed
the
will
in
front
of
him
gave
him
the
pen
pointed
out
the
place
for
him
and
with
that
cortelyon
slowly
and
carefully
signed
his
name
then
tew
took
the
will
to
the
table
and
caused
grice
and
denny
to
sign
it
one
after
the
other
when
that
was
done
the
two
men
were
dismissed
yes
and
after
that
following
the
men
into
the
corridor
by
the
squire
orders
i
made
each
of
them
a
present
of
a
crown
piece
that
done
i
at
once
went
back
to
the
room
tew
was
standing
by
the
table
with
the
folded
will
in
his
hand
it
up
said
my
master
to
me
tew
having
handed
to
it
to
me
i
at
once
proceeded
to
enclose
it
in
the
sheet
of
parchment
out
of
which
it
was
taken
by
piljoy
a
little
while
since
sealing
the
packet
in
two
places
with
my
master
own
seal
then
i
held
him
up
again
and
with
a
trembling
hand
he
wrote
on
the
envelope
cortelyon
his
will
that
done
the
packet
was
given
into
the
custody
of
tew
and
the
business
was
at
an
end
not
quite
andry
not
quite
at
least
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
you
are
forgetting
the
duplicate
will
what
became
of
that
tew
had
not
been
five
minutes
gone
before
my
master
drew
the
other
will
from
under
his
pillow
and
giving
it
to
me
said
it
now
at
once
there
was
a
fire
in
the
room
and
taking
the
will
i
thrust
it
between
the
bars
cortelyon
never
took
his
eyes
off
the
grate
till
it
was
burnt
to
ashes
you
have
no
reason
whatever
for
supposing
that
the
unsigned
will
was
substituted
for
the
signed
one
during
the
time
you
were
out
of
the
room
no
sir
how
should
i
tew
never
left
the
room
and
when
i
went
back
it
was
from
his
hands
i
received
the
will
in
order
to
seal
it
up
apparently
piljoy
had
no
more
questions
to
put
after
a
glance
round
at
the
perplexed
faces
of
his
audience
he
said
notwithstanding
the
very
clear
and
straightforward
statement
with
which
andry
luce
has
just
favored
us
the
mystery
of
the
unsigned
will
remains
exactly
where
it
was
before
we
seem
no
nearer
a
solution
of
it
than
we
were
at
first
and
i
confess
myself
wholly
at
a
loss
to
advise
as
to
what
step
if
any
it
behoves
us
to
take
next
never
in
the
whole
of
my
experience
have
i
been
confronted
with
a
state
of
affairs
so
puzzling
and
inexplicable
never
heard
tell
of
owt
like
it
dang
me
if
i
have
exclaimed
sir
james
who
had
a
habit
of
lapsing
into
the
vernacular
now
and
again
licks
all
to
bits
that
it
does
muttered
staniforth
the
vicar
and
delafosse
spoke
together
in
low
tones
so
far
bullivant
had
maintained
an
unbroken
silence
though
more
than
once
greatly
tempted
to
do
so
she
had
put
a
strong
restraint
upon
herself
and
had
sat
there
with
compressed
lips
listening
to
all
that
was
said
passing
through
the
whole
gamut
of
feeling
from
hope
to
despair
and
finally
struck
to
the
earth
almost
as
it
seemed
beyond
recovery
by
piljoy
last
words
there
had
been
revealed
to
her
a
golden
vision
far
exceeding
her
utmost
dreams
but
between
her
and
it
some
malignant
fiend
had
dug
a
shadowy
gulf
which
he
defied
her
to
overpass
she
had
been
vouchsafed
a
glimpse
of
paradise
only
to
have
the
gates
of
pearl
slammed
in
her
face
it
was
maddening
her
very
soul
was
aflame
with
impotent
rage
she
was
tortured
almost
beyond
endurance
by
the
knowledge
of
all
she
had
lost
of
all
that
had
slipped
through
her
fingers
as
at
the
bidding
of
a
necromancer
before
she
had
a
chance
of
grasping
it
of
all
that
ought
to
have
been
hers
but
was
not
she
could
no
longer
keep
silent
it
is
very
evident
to
me
she
began
addressing
herself
directly
to
the
lawyer
that
my
helpless
boy
and
i
have
been
made
the
victims
of
a
vile
conspiracy
whether
you
sir
are
in
the
secret
of
it
or
no
i
can
not
say
but
i
give
you
warning
that
i
shall
lose
no
time
in
placing
the
affair
in
the
hands
of
my
solicitors
and
that
even
if
it
cost
me
every
shilling
i
have
in
the
world
this
foul
attempt
to
defraud
me
and
mine
shall
be
unmasked
and
the
concocters
of
it
brought
to
the
bar
of
justice
she
spoke
with
studied
quietude
and
without
any
trace
of
passion
but
her
hearers
felt
that
in
those
smooth
accents
there
was
a
hidden
venom
far
more
dangerous
than
any
mere
outburst
of
feminine
anger
would
have
been
a
vile
conspiracy
burst
forth
the
irate
lawyer
i
would
have
you
know
madame
that
she
stopped
him
with
an
imperious
gesture
i
have
said
all
i
wish
to
say
and
no
empty
protestations
on
your
part
will
avail
anything
roguery
has
been
at
work
and
must
be
unmasked
it
is
enough
that
you
know
my
intentions
she
had
risen
while
speaking
and
now
after
the
slightest
possible
bow
to
sir
james
and
the
others
she
moved
with
her
proudest
and
most
dignified
air
towards
the
door
which
andry
hastened
to
open
for
her
and
so
went
her
way
to
the
great
relief
of
everybody
there
well
that
caps
everything
ejaculated
staniforth
a
sweet
temper
to
live
with
eh
jimmy
ay
but
think
of
all
the
woman
has
lost
and
by
a
turn
of
wheel
the
like
of
which
i
never
heard
tell
of
no
wonder
she
put
about
in
her
place
who
would
be
not
but
what
mind
you
i
consider
the
will
a
most
unjust
one
and
i
ca
say
i
anything
but
glad
that
things
have
turned
out
as
they
have
delafosse
had
sat
through
the
proceedings
as
mum
as
a
mouse
he
had
all
a
collector
selfishness
and
although
he
told
himself
how
glad
he
was
that
despite
his
late
friend
unjust
will
the
rightful
heir
would
succeed
to
the
property
he
could
not
help
being
very
sorrowful
on
his
own
account
under
the
changed
circumstances
of
the
case
not
a
coin
not
a
medal
not
a
curio
of
any
kind
would
come
to
him
and
there
were
so
many
things
in
his
friend
collection
which
his
soul
coveted
it
was
very
very
sad
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
when
the
others
were
gone
piljoy
and
nell
had
a
little
confidential
talk
together
never
in
the
whole
of
my
professional
experience
have
i
been
so
perplexed
and
mystified
as
by
the
events
of
this
afternoon
said
the
lawyer
i
ca
make
head
or
tail
of
and
that
a
fact
of
course
when
i
get
back
i
shall
question
tew
very
closely
about
all
that
took
place
at
the
signing
of
the
will
but
i
must
say
that
i
have
very
little
hope
of
his
being
able
to
throw
any
fresh
light
on
the
affair
it
just
as
if
we
had
all
been
made
the
victims
of
a
conjurer
trick
not
but
what
miss
nell
i
more
than
pleased
at
the
way
things
have
turned
out
and
i
do
mind
confessing
to
you
that
i
was
strongly
opposed
to
the
will
as
it
stands
and
went
as
far
as
i
dared
in
the
endeavor
to
persuade
your
uncle
not
to
disinherit
his
grandson
but
you
know
the
kind
of
man
he
was
how
obstinate
and
how
utterly
opposed
to
any
suggestions
from
others
which
ran
counter
to
his
own
views
indeed
he
would
hardly
listen
to
me
and
ended
by
telling
me
with
an
oath
to
mind
my
own
business
on
one
point
only
do
i
feel
sorry
if
no
other
will
turns
up
of
which
i
fail
to
see
any
likelihood
you
my
dear
miss
nell
will
be
left
out
in
the
cold
for
in
that
case
as
i
have
remarked
already
the
son
of
richard
cortelyon
becomes
the
sole
heir
and
legatee
and
do
you
think
for
one
moment
piljoy
that
i
am
anything
but
rejoiced
that
such
should
be
the
case
demanded
nell
with
sparkling
eyes
if
you
do
you
misjudge
me
strangely
oh
it
was
a
most
unjust
and
unnatural
will
and
my
uncle
himself
acknowledged
it
to
be
so
but
not
till
too
late
with
his
last
breath
he
implored
me
to
send
for
the
will
and
destroy
it
his
last
conscious
words
were
my
grandson
all
to
that
woman
meaning
bullivant
who
was
there
by
the
bedside
had
he
but
lived
a
few
hours
longer
the
will
would
have
been
destroyed
in
accordance
with
his
wishes
i
am
very
glad
you
have
told
me
this
miss
nell
very
glad
indeed
if
one
were
superstitiously
inclined
one
would
not
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
it
was
the
squire
own
hand
which
by
some
means
unknown
to
us
erased
his
signature
from
a
document
the
existence
of
which
in
the
clear
light
which
sometimes
comes
to
people
at
the
point
of
death
he
saw
reason
to
regret
should
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
i
shall
look
back
to
this
day
as
one
of
the
days
of
my
existence
said
nell
with
fervor
no
words
could
express
to
you
how
glad
i
am
but
tell
me
piljoy
what
is
the
next
thing
to
be
done
my
advice
is
that
just
at
present
we
do
nothing
should
it
really
prove
to
be
bullivant
intention
to
contest
the
claim
for
one
never
can
foretell
what
a
desperate
woman
may
or
may
not
choose
to
do
i
shall
doubtless
hear
from
her
solicitors
before
long
meanwhile
our
best
plan
will
be
to
rest
quietly
on
our
oars

the
missing
heir
not
till
a
fortnight
had
gone
by
did
nell
hear
from
piljoy
then
he
wrote
as
follows
dear
miss
baynard
before
parting
from
you
last
i
told
you
that
on
getting
back
home
i
would
lose
no
time
in
minutely
questioning
my
clerk
tew
with
regard
to
all
that
passed
between
cortelyon
and
himself
at
the
signing
of
the
will
as
you
may
remember
the
chief
point
that
wanted
clearing
up
was
whether
there
was
any
possibility
of
the
unsigned
will
having
been
substituted
for
the
signed
one
during
the
two
or
three
minutes
andry
luce
was
absent
from
the
room
tew
is
positive
no
such
substitution
took
place
his
words
are
signed
will
was
never
out
of
my
keeping
from
the
moment
the
witnesses
left
the
room
till
andry
luce
return
when
by
cortelyon
direction
i
gave
the
will
to
him
to
be
enclosed
and
sealed
up
so
we
remain
just
as
wise
as
we
were
before
i
believe
i
told
you
that
for
a
little
while
to
come
i
thought
it
would
be
advisable
to
remain
quiescent
in
the
affair
while
awaiting
the
first
move
on
the
part
of
bullivant
solicitors
provided
they
thought
it
advisable
to
move
at
all
well
a
couple
of
days
ago
i
was
waited
upon
by
cotwell
the
junior
partner
in
a
firm
of
lanchester
lawyers
he
met
me
in
a
by
no
means
hostile
spirit
the
main
object
of
his
visit
being
to
obtain
my
permission
to
put
to
tew
the
very
question
i
had
put
to
him
already
of
course
tew
could
only
give
cotwell
the
same
answer
that
he
had
given
me
and
so
far
as
bullivant
was
concerned
there
was
no
satisfaction
to
be
got
out
of
that
cotwell
and
i
had
a
long
confabulation
before
he
left
from
certain
hints
he
let
fall
i
judge
that
has
not
scrupled
to
give
expression
to
her
belief
that
she
was
designedly
tricked
by
that
of
set
purpose
he
caused
the
signed
will
to
be
burnt
and
left
the
unsigned
one
in
existence
all
which
is
an
absolute
contradiction
of
what
tew
is
prepared
to
swear
to
but
what
strange
beliefs
will
not
a
disappointed
woman
cherish
more
especially
when
she
sees
cause
for
imagining
that
she
has
been
hoodwinked
into
the
bargain
after
all
it
seems
to
be
very
doubtful
whether
will
go
to
law
in
my
opinion
it
would
be
sheer
madness
on
her
part
to
do
so
and
i
have
very
little
doubt
that
privately
cotwell
thinks
the
same
only
of
course
he
is
bound
to
bark
at
the
bidding
of
his
client
but
when
it
comes
to
biting
we
shall
see
at
any
rate
i
shall
wait
no
longer
but
at
once
proceed
to
take
the
necessary
steps
for
legalizing
the
rights
of
the
youthful
heir
as
if
no
such
person
as
were
in
existence
will
you
be
good
enough
to
inform
me
at
your
convenience
under
whose
care
the
child
is
now
living
and
where
he
may
be
found
provided
of
course
that
his
present
address
is
known
to
you
nell
reply
was
sent
by
the
next
post
it
was
on
a
friday
morning
that
piljoy
letter
came
to
hand
and
had
she
not
been
suffering
from
a
cold
which
had
reduced
her
voice
to
a
mere
whisper
she
would
have
set
out
for
london
within
a
few
hours
of
her
receipt
of
it
but
although
she
was
hungering
to
see
the
child
a
delay
of
a
few
days
would
not
matter
greatly
and
doubtless
she
would
be
well
enough
to
travel
it
was
a
matter
of
between
two
hundred
and
fifty
and
three
hundred
miles
and
all
by
coach
by
the
following
tuesday
or
wednesday
at
the
latest
tuesday
morning
came
and
found
nell
few
preparations
made
her
impatience
would
brook
no
further
delay
places
for
herself
and
her
maid
had
been
secured
in
the
london
coach
which
passed
through
tuxford
shortly
after
midday
but
a
surprise
was
in
store
for
her
illustration
evan
has
been
missing
since
yesterday
the
postman
time
for
arriving
at
stanbrook
was
ten
or
thereabouts
this
morning
he
brought
a
letter
for
miss
baynard
which
she
knew
by
the
address
before
opening
it
to
be
from
mardin
one
of
those
intuitions
which
come
to
us
we
know
not
how
or
whence
whispered
to
her
that
it
was
a
bringer
of
ill
tidings
her
fingers
trembled
as
she
opened
it
all
it
had
to
tell
was
told
in
little
more
than
a
dozen
words
evan
has
been
missing
since
yesterday
and
can
not
be
found
anywhere
come
at
once
harriet
mardin
never
had
the
journey
to
london
seemed
so
long
and
tedious
to
nell
as
it
did
on
this
occasion
from
the
coach
office
she
drove
to
lady
carradine
where
although
she
had
not
advised
her
ladyship
of
her
coming
she
knew
that
she
was
sure
of
a
welcome
half
an
hour
later
she
was
on
her
way
to
chelsea
mardin
received
her
with
a
burst
of
tears
indeed
the
good
soul
had
done
little
else
than
cry
since
the
child
had
been
missed
her
story
did
not
take
long
in
the
telling
it
was
a
fine
afternoon
and
evan
had
been
playing
as
he
was
often
allowed
to
do
with
some
neighbors
children
in
a
field
not
more
than
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
from
the
house
mardin
had
been
on
the
point
of
going
to
call
him
in
to
tea
when
one
of
his
playmates
came
to
tell
her
that
evan
had
gone
off
with
a
tall
dark
gentleman
who
went
up
to
him
in
the
field
and
telling
him
that
a
pretty
lady
had
sent
for
him
led
him
away
to
a
carriage
which
was
waiting
in
the
lane
close
by
into
which
they
both
got
and
were
at
once
driven
away
from
the
first
mardin
had
felt
convinced
in
her
own
mind
that
the
boy
had
been
abducted
by
means
of
a
ruse
and
that
there
was
no
intention
of
bringing
him
back
then
she
went
on
to
inform
nell
that
she
had
not
only
written
to
her
but
to
dare
as
well
who
fortunately
happened
to
be
in
town
and
had
lost
no
time
in
making
his
appearance
at
lawn
cottage
further
when
told
that
miss
baynard
had
been
communicated
with
and
in
all
likelihood
would
come
as
fast
as
the
coach
could
bring
her
after
her
receipt
of
the
news
he
had
at
once
hired
a
room
at
an
inn
in
the
neighborhood
thinking
that
she
might
perhaps
like
to
see
him
and
consult
with
him
in
the
matter
as
soon
as
possible
after
her
arrival
at
the
mention
of
dare
name
the
tints
in
nell
cheeks
deepened
till
they
glowed
like
those
of
a
damask
rose
and
the
thought
of
so
soon
seeing
him
again
sent
a
rush
of
happiness
to
her
heart
and
caused
her
to
tingle
from
head
to
foot
with
a
flush
of
gladness
which
yet
had
in
it
a
touch
of
apprehension
it
might
be
a
fact
that
her
strength
had
failed
her
in
her
struggle
against
fate
and
that
her
heart
had
secretly
capitulated
but
the
secret
was
her
own
and
should
never
pass
her
lips
her
conqueror
should
never
know
that
he
had
conquered
on
that
point
she
was
resolved
and
yet
in
the
midst
of
her
happiness
she
trembled
at
the
thought
of
meeting
dare
again
was
it
because
she
had
a
fear
of
betraying
herself
in
her
own
despite
or
was
it
because
she
was
conscious
that
she
had
to
guard
against
a
traitor
who
had
betrayed
her
once
already
a
question
which
mardin
put
to
her
did
not
tend
to
reassure
her
shall
i
send
word
to
dare
that
you
are
here
miss
and
that
you
would
like
to
see
him
she
was
still
hesitating
over
her
reply
when
there
came
a
ring
at
the
bell
why
that
must
be
him
exclaimed
the
widow
and
so
it
proved
to
be
he
had
been
watching
for
nell
arrival
had
seen
her
come
and
after
waiting
had
followed
her
to
the
cottage
but
of
all
this
he
said
nothing
nell
strung
herself
up
and
met
him
without
any
show
of
embarrassment
but
not
without
a
touch
of
heightened
color
dare
was
as
easy
cool
and
as
much
master
of
himself
as
he
always
was
the
only
difference
that
any
one
who
knew
him
well
might
have
marked
in
him
was
that
his
eyes
were
more
than
ordinarily
brilliant
when
he
had
shaken
hands
with
nell
he
sat
down
in
the
chair
just
vacated
by
mardin
nell
had
not
forgotten
the
return
of
the
mask
and
all
that
was
implied
thereby
and
as
her
eyes
met
dare
she
could
not
help
saying
to
herself
does
he
still
know
me
simply
as
miss
baynard
of
stanbrook
or
has
he
discovered
in
me
the
amateur
highwayman
to
whom
on
a
certain
occasion
he
behaved
with
such
signal
kindness
but
it
was
a
question
she
was
no
nearer
being
able
to
answer
than
she
had
been
the
first
time
she
asked
it
dare
plunged
at
once
medias
like
a
man
who
has
a
matter
in
hand
in
dealing
with
which
there
must
be
neither
delay
nor
hesitancy
before
his
coming
nell
had
felt
utterly
helpless
in
the
affair
she
had
neither
known
what
to
do
nor
what
even
to
suggest
but
she
had
not
been
long
in
his
company
before
she
felt
figuratively
speaking
as
if
a
strong
arm
had
been
put
round
her
from
which
she
drew
both
comfort
and
support
his
mere
presence
braced
and
strengthened
her
like
a
tonic
this
is
a
very
strange
piece
of
business
miss
baynard
which
has
brought
you
and
me
together
again
he
began
i
presume
that
mardin
has
made
you
acquainted
with
such
scanty
particulars
as
are
known
to
her
that
the
case
is
one
of
abduction
there
can
i
think
be
very
little
doubt
if
any
at
all
i
saw
the
notice
of
death
in
the
presumably
the
stolen
boy
is
his
heir
but
doubtless
you
are
in
a
position
to
inform
me
whether
such
is
or
is
not
the
case
that
evan
is
his
grandfather
heir
is
due
to
a
singular
and
wholly
inexplicable
circumstance
the
nature
of
which
it
may
be
as
well
that
i
should
explain
to
you
with
that
nell
went
on
to
relate
to
him
the
story
of
the
will
as
already
known
to
the
reader
he
was
intensely
interested
in
the
recital
when
she
had
come
to
an
end
he
remained
for
some
moments
lost
in
thought
then
he
said
so
far
as
i
can
see
at
present
there
is
only
one
person
who
would
have
any
motive
for
spiriting
away
the
boy
that
person
is
bullivant
and
the
motive
revenge
but
to
revenge
oneself
on
an
innocent
child
it
seems
too
mean
and
cowardly
for
belief
happily
miss
baynard
you
have
seen
but
little
of
the
darker
side
of
human
nature
mean
and
cowardly
actions
are
far
more
common
than
such
as
you
have
any
notion
of
but
if
my
supposition
has
any
truth
in
it
the
case
we
are
now
considering
will
go
far
to
widen
your
knowledge
of
such
things
with
your
permission
i
will
go
at
once
to
bow
street
and
report
the
circumstances
of
the
abduction
so
far
as
they
are
known
to
us
to
the
authorities
there
but
without
any
mention
of
bullivant
name
leaving
them
to
take
whatever
steps
may
seem
advisable
as
regards
bullivant
i
purpose
making
certain
private
inquiries
on
my
own
account
the
result
of
which
i
will
communicate
to
you
as
early
as
possible
meanwhile
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
as
well
for
you
to
write
to
piljoy
informing
him
of
the
disappearance
of
the
child
as
also
that
the
case
has
been
reported
to
the
proper
authorities
finally
it
may
be
advisable
that
for
the
present
my
name
should
be
kept
in
the
background
and
so
after
a
little
further
talk
they
parted
with
an
agreement
to
meet
again
at
lawn
cottage
next
day
a
hackney
coach
was
fetched
and
dare
saw
miss
baynard
into
it
she
had
been
startled
by
his
announcement
that
he
was
about
to
go
personally
to
bow
street
such
a
proceeding
on
his
part
seemed
to
her
the
very
acme
of
recklessness
one
would
have
thought
it
was
the
last
place
in
the
world
at
which
captain
nightshade
would
have
cared
to
show
his
face
she
could
not
help
admiring
him
for
his
daring
but
all
the
same
she
felt
that
she
should
breathe
more
freely
when
she
knew
that
he
had
gone
and
come
in
safety

mutual
confidences
one
may
be
sure
there
was
no
failure
of
appointment
next
day
on
the
part
of
either
of
our
young
people
after
nell
had
informed
dare
that
the
letter
to
piljoy
had
been
duly
written
and
dispatched
and
he
had
given
her
a
brief
account
of
his
visit
to
bow
street
where
he
had
left
a
full
description
of
the
missing
child
compiled
with
information
furnished
by
mardin
there
seemed
little
more
to
say
or
do
of
a
certain
task
he
had
set
before
himself
and
of
a
certain
journey
he
meant
to
undertake
dare
deemed
it
best
not
to
enter
into
any
details
all
he
gave
miss
baynard
to
understand
was
that
nothing
should
be
left
undone
on
his
part
in
his
endeavor
to
trace
the
abducted
heir
but
nell
felt
strongly
that
the
time
had
come
for
a
clear
understanding
on
both
sides
their
masks
had
been
seen
through
their
disguise
penetrated
each
of
them
had
played
a
double
part
within
the
other
knowledge
and
yet
each
had
pretended
to
ignore
the
fact
the
day
of
was
at
an
end
she
saw
clearly
that
if
any
reference
was
to
be
made
to
their
first
meeting
it
must
come
from
herself
dare
she
felt
sure
would
never
as
much
as
hint
at
a
circumstance
her
silence
about
which
could
only
lead
him
to
conclude
that
she
was
determined
to
ignore
it
further
than
that
she
wanted
to
set
herself
straight
with
him
to
explain
the
motives
which
led
to
her
assumption
for
one
night
only
of
the
of
a
gentleman
of
the
road
she
could
no
longer
rest
satisfied
with
the
consciousness
that
any
action
of
hers
should
remain
in
his
eyes
under
the
shadow
of
ambiguity
or
suspicion
that
she
had
managed
so
far
not
to
betray
her
other
and
far
sweeter
secret
she
felt
pretty
well
assured
and
the
knowledge
comforted
her
exceedingly
for
while
determined
to
brush
aside
all
the
cobwebs
that
had
hitherto
existed
between
them
she
was
equally
as
determined
that
of
that
hidden
flower
which
perfumed
and
made
beautiful
the
garden
of
her
heart
he
should
know
nothing
whatever
you
and
i
dare
had
met
on
one
occasion
before
our
first
meeting
under
this
roof
began
nell
turning
her
large
hazel
eyes
with
a
sort
of
grave
questioning
in
them
full
upon
him
it
was
not
often
that
dare
was
taken
by
surprise
but
he
certainly
was
just
now
his
swarthy
cheeks
flushed
with
a
color
that
was
rare
to
them
but
it
did
not
take
him
longer
than
half
a
dozen
seconds
to
recover
himself
with
a
low
bow
he
said
it
is
not
for
me
to
dispute
any
statement
miss
baynard
may
choose
to
make
my
reason
for
referring
to
the
occasion
in
question
is
because
i
am
desirous
of
explaining
under
what
circumstances
i
was
led
to
embark
on
that
adventure
pardon
me
but
is
any
such
explanation
needed
certainly
it
is
not
by
me
such
an
impertinence
is
what
i
never
dreamed
of
why
go
into
a
matter
which
now
belongs
wholly
to
the
past
for
my
own
satisfaction
if
for
nothing
else
again
dare
gravely
inclined
his
head
it
was
evident
miss
baynard
was
determined
to
have
her
own
way
although
probably
she
had
nothing
more
to
tell
him
than
he
either
knew
or
guessed
already
on
the
occasion
of
our
first
meeting
of
all
resumed
nell
i
believe
i
remarked
to
you
that
the
object
of
my
escapade
was
not
to
despoil
some
innocent
traveller
of
his
purse
but
to
obtain
possession
of
a
will
which
i
knew
to
be
in
the
keeping
of
a
certain
person
who
on
his
way
home
travelling
by
was
bound
to
pass
the
place
where
i
was
lying
in
wait
for
him
so
much
i
gathered
from
what
you
told
me
the
will
in
question
was
the
one
i
spoke
to
you
about
yesterday
by
the
provisions
of
which
my
uncle
disinherited
his
grandson
in
favor
of
the
son
of
the
woman
between
whom
and
himself
there
was
no
relationship
whatever
i
thought
then
as
i
think
still
that
the
will
was
a
most
unjust
and
iniquitous
one
and
i
determined
if
it
were
anyhow
possible
to
do
so
to
get
possession
of
it
and
destroy
it
how
ignominiously
i
failed
in
the
attempt
you
know
already
all
this
i
understood
from
what
you
were
good
enough
to
tell
me
yesterday
that
served
to
throw
a
clear
light
on
whatever
had
seemed
dark
before
when
i
ventured
on
my
rash
attempt
which
so
fortunately
for
all
concerned
proved
unsuccessful
my
uncle
had
been
given
up
by
his
doctors
and
i
had
every
reason
for
believing
that
he
could
not
possibly
live
to
make
another
will
as
for
the
moral
aspect
of
the
affair
i
think
perhaps
that
the
less
i
say
on
that
score
the
better
i
was
carried
away
by
a
flame
of
indignation
which
so
to
speak
swept
me
off
my
feet
thrusting
all
considerations
of
prudence
as
well
as
of
right
or
wrong
into
the
background
blinding
my
moral
sense
for
the
time
being
and
leaving
room
in
my
mind
for
nothing
save
a
burning
desire
at
whatever
cost
to
get
the
will
into
my
hands
but
fate
defeated
my
purpose
and
the
end
i
aimed
at
was
brought
about
by
far
different
means
miss
baynard
had
relieved
her
mind
and
one
usually
derives
a
sense
of
comfort
from
being
able
to
do
that
she
had
put
herself
straight
with
dare
there
was
no
longer
any
question
between
them
of
a
dual
personality
he
knew
that
in
him
she
had
recognized
the
captain
nightshade
of
her
adventure
and
he
had
heard
from
her
own
lips
if
there
was
any
satisfaction
in
that
what
he
most
likely
knew
or
guessed
before
that
she
was
the
masquerader
in
male
attire
who
had
played
such
an
unheroic
part
on
that
occasion
but
one
confidence
often
tends
to
beget
another
and
now
strange
to
say
geoffrey
dare
felt
strongly
impelled
to
crave
miss
patience
for
a
little
while
in
order
that
he
might
make
clear
to
her
under
what
stress
of
circumstances
he
had
been
driven
to
take
to
the
king
highway
miss
baynard
raised
no
objections
to
listening
to
anything
he
might
have
to
tell
her
did
not
desdemona
seriously
incline
to
the
moor
of
venice
the
while
he
told
the
tale
of
his
adventures
by
sea
and
land
and
why
should
not
she
do
the
same
what
i
have
to
tell
you
is
in
the
main
a
record
of
faults
and
follies
began
dare
when
leave
had
been
given
him
but
i
will
make
my
narrative
as
brief
as
possible
let
me
start
by
remarking
that
i
have
good
blood
in
my
veins
and
can
trace
back
my
ancestry
in
a
direct
line
for
upwards
of
two
hundred
years
it
was
my
misfortune
to
lose
both
my
parents
long
before
i
was
out
of
my
teens
on
coming
of
age
i
succeeded
to
a
fortune
of
forty
thousand
pounds
the
accumulated
income
of
my
minority
thereupon
i
at
once
plunged
into
all
the
gayeties
and
temptations
of
town
life
showering
my
guineas
right
and
left
with
lavish
hands
as
if
they
could
never
come
to
an
end
cards
dice
and
the
turf
helped
me
in
turn
on
the
downward
road
i
had
no
one
to
counsel
or
warn
me
the
person
who
had
filled
the
post
of
guardian
to
me
from
the
date
of
my
father
death
was
himself
a
broken
man
of
pleasure
who
encouraged
rather
than
restrained
me
in
the
road
i
was
treading
and
had
no
scruple
about
dipping
his
hand
into
my
purse
whenever
he
had
been
more
than
usually
unlucky
at
the
tables
then
by
and
by
i
fell
in
love
or
what
at
that
time
i
believed
to
be
love
but
i
know
now
and
have
long
known
that
i
was
drawn
to
miss
tighe
as
in
the
fable
we
read
how
hapless
mariners
were
drawn
to
the
sirens
of
the
deep
because
they
had
not
enough
to
resist
their
wiles
however
i
was
infatuated
and
which
was
all
she
cared
about
for
she
was
a
compound
of
greed
and
selfishness
i
lavished
jewelry
and
presents
upon
her
as
if
i
could
not
do
enough
to
make
patent
my
folly
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
my
birthday
found
my
fortune
reduced
to
a
very
few
thousands
the
end
came
shortly
after
with
the
elopement
of
miss
tighe
with
the
man
whom
next
to
dick
cortelyon
i
had
accounted
my
dearest
friend
i
was
still
staggering
from
this
blow
when
another
of
my
friends
by
means
of
a
forged
cheque
contrived
to
defraud
me
of
the
poor
wreck
of
my
fortune
save
a
few
paltry
hundreds
before
putting
the
atlantic
between
himself
and
me
it
was
not
till
ruin
stared
me
in
the
face
and
i
knew
not
which
way
to
turn
that
i
took
to
the
as
many
a
spendthrift
of
as
good
birth
as
i
has
done
before
me
but
it
is
some
slight
salve
to
my
conscience
to
know
that
i
have
never
eased
any
man
of
his
purse
who
was
not
well
able
to
bear
the
loss
that
i
have
never
despoiled
one
of
the
opposite
sex
and
that
i
have
never
failed
to
distribute
among
the
poor
more
than
half
of
all
i
have
taken
from
the
rich
he
ceased
and
for
some
moments
neither
of
them
broke
the
silence
his
eyes
had
been
fixed
on
the
window
as
he
told
his
tale
and
he
still
kept
them
turned
away
from
his
companion
he
was
now
softly
tapping
his
teeth
with
the
nails
of
one
hand
it
was
wrong
it
was
very
wrong
and
nell
admitted
it
to
be
such
but
do
what
she
would
she
could
not
blame
him
the
man
by
his
own
admission
was
a
highwayman
a
minion
of
the
moon
of
course
the
fact
had
long
been
known
to
her
but
it
had
never
been
so
clearly
brought
home
to
her
before
and
yet
all
she
could
do
was
to
pity
him
oh
it
was
shameful
and
besides
we
all
know
how
close
pity
is
akin
to
something
else
she
tried
to
despise
herself
and
to
feel
enraged
with
herself
but
could
not
but
they
could
not
sit
mum
forever
it
was
her
turn
to
speak
something
she
must
say
but
what
the
dangers
and
perils
of
the
kind
of
life
you
have
been
speaking
of
are
many
and
great
her
words
faltered
a
little
in
her
own
despite
why
not
give
it
up
dare
why
not
try
to
find
some
other
and
more
reputable
way
of
making
a
living
how
i
wish
you
would
how
i
wish
pardon
me
miss
baynard
but
i
given
it
up
he
spoke
with
a
certain
abruptness
and
as
he
did
so
he
turned
his
black
eyes
full
upon
her
captain
nightshade
last
adventure
on
the
road
was
the
one
in
which
you
yourself
were
so
singularly
mixed
up
from
that
night
he
resolved
to
turn
over
a
fresh
leaf
for
one
short
hour
he
had
come
under
an
influence
powerful
enough
and
sweet
enough
to
make
a
new
man
of
him
the
resolve
then
made
has
never
been
broken
he
spoke
with
an
emphasis
which
left
no
room
for
mistake
as
to
his
meaning
nell
eyes
sank
before
the
passion
which
had
suddenly
leapt
to
life
in
his
face
and
throat
flushed
a
lovely
color
it
was
all
she
could
do
not
to
betray
that
she
was
in
every
limb
i
am
very
very
glad
dare
to
hear
that
you
have
seen
your
way
to
a
changed
mode
of
life
was
it
miss
baynard
who
spoke
or
some
one
else
what
was
this
strange
new
feeling
of
timidity
almost
of
shrinking
which
had
seized
upon
her
she
might
have
been
the
veriest
miss
fresh
from
school
never
had
she
despised
herself
more
heartily
than
at
that
moment
i
have
told
you
miss
baynard
that
i
left
london
a
broken
man
resumed
dare
after
a
pause
i
had
however
my
mother
jewelry
still
untouched
but
no
other
resource
being
now
left
me
i
was
compelled
to
let
it
go
a
little
later
the
sum
of
four
hundred
pounds
reached
me
anonymously
with
a
letter
stating
that
it
was
returned
by
a
dying
man
it
having
been
won
from
my
father
twenty
years
before
by
cheating
at
cards
that
it
came
as
a
veritable
godsend
i
need
hardly
tell
you
and
yet
if
i
would
have
let
you
you
would
still
have
gone
on
paying
for
evan
maintenance
i
had
promised
my
dead
friend
that
i
would
care
for
the
boy
as
if
he
were
my
own
and
had
you
not
come
between
me
and
him
it
was
a
promise
i
was
resolved
to
keep
at
every
cost
i
had
already
decided
on
my
plans
for
the
future
and
when
i
left
england
i
should
have
taken
the
boy
with
me
when
you
left
england
mr
dare
i
have
some
relations
settled
in
virginia
who
have
more
than
once
pressed
me
to
go
out
to
them
it
was
and
remains
my
intention
to
settle
there
and
there
to
lay
the
foundations
of
a
new
life
very
different
from
the
old
one
now
i
shall
have
to
go
alone
but
first
i
shall
see
this
business
through
of
my
missing
godson
why
did
nell
heart
sink
so
unaccountably
at
this
statement
of
intentions
what
did
it
matter
where
he
might
choose
to
make
his
future
home
whatever
he
might
secretly
be
to
her
she
was
nothing
to
him
and
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
she
ever
could
be
she
knew
and
she
made
no
attempt
to
disguise
the
fact
from
herself
that
when
he
sailed
away
from
england
he
would
take
her
heart
with
him
but
what
then
of
how
many
women
was
it
not
the
lot
to
give
away
their
hearts
in
secret
and
to
go
through
life
hopeless
of
a
return
nay
in
many
cases
without
the
man
to
whom
it
was
given
knowing
that
he
had
such
a
thing
in
his
keeping
her
case
would
be
merely
one
more
added
to
the
number
nell
was
to
return
to
stanbrook
on
the
morrow
and
before
she
and
dare
parted
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
communicate
with
her
there
as
soon
as
he
had
any
tidings
of
the
missing
child
and
that
the
bow
street
authorities
on
their
part
should
do
the
same
there
was
one
point
with
regard
to
which
nell
wished
that
dare
had
seen
fit
to
enlighten
her
and
that
was
as
to
the
nature
of
the
relationship
between
himself
and
the
mysterious
ellerslie
of
rockmount
for
that
a
relationship
of
some
sort
existed
between
them
she
now
felt
more
convinced
than
ever
she
had
seen
ellerslie
but
once
and
that
merely
for
an
hour
by
candlelight
and
while
conscious
of
a
strange
illusive
likeness
on
his
part
to
some
one
more
especially
about
the
eyes
she
had
been
unable
to
recall
to
mind
who
that
some
one
was
she
knew
now
and
had
known
for
some
time
that
the
original
of
the
shadowy
likeness
was
none
other
than
geoffrey
dare
but
no
mention
of
ellerslie
name
had
escaped
the
latter
lips
and
it
was
certainly
not
her
place
to
question
him
there
was
one
more
point
as
to
which
her
curiosity
seemed
doomed
to
remain
equally
unsatisfied
she
was
still
ignorant
whether
she
was
indebted
for
the
return
of
her
mask
to
ellerslie
or
to
geoffrey
dare
chapter
xx
the
adventures
of
a
it
may
or
may
not
be
remembered
by
the
reader
that
in
an
early
chapter
of
this
veracious
history
mention
was
made
of
a
certain
sir
peter
warrendale
and
of
his
unavailing
pursuit
of
his
runaway
niece
and
her
lover
when
on
their
way
to
gretna
green
it
was
also
told
how
on
his
return
journey
he
was
stopped
by
a
highwayman
whom
under
the
title
of
colonel
delnay
he
had
met
before
under
rather
peculiar
circumstances
and
was
politely
relieved
of
his
purse
and
other
trifles
no
one
need
have
wished
for
a
worse
character
than
that
borne
by
sir
peter
warrendale
for
a
score
miles
round
whatton
ferris
his
private
life
would
not
bear
examination
as
a
landlord
he
was
mean
and
to
a
degree
and
in
his
magisterial
capacity
he
was
never
known
to
temper
mercy
with
justice
but
always
to
make
a
point
of
inflicting
the
maximum
penalty
allowed
by
law
on
any
poor
wretch
who
might
have
the
misfortune
to
be
haled
before
him
notwithstanding
his
irascibility
of
temper
and
the
bluster
in
which
he
indulged
when
in
pursuit
of
his
runaway
niece
sir
peter
was
an
arrant
poltroon
at
heart
and
into
such
a
fright
did
he
fall
when
his
chaise
was
stopped
by
the
sham
colonel
delnay
that
happening
to
have
his
in
his
hand
he
proffered
it
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
together
with
his
purse
if
only
his
life
might
be
spared
the
box
was
studded
with
brilliants
and
dare
for
he
was
the
gentleman
of
the
road
being
well
aware
of
the
mean
and
avaricious
nature
of
the
man
and
how
the
loss
of
it
would
grieve
him
to
the
soul
took
it
with
the
intention
of
returning
it
anonymously
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
weeks
but
when
about
a
month
later
he
caused
certain
inquiries
to
be
made
with
a
view
to
the
restitution
of
the
box
he
found
that
scrope
hall
was
shut
up
and
that
sir
peter
and
his
family
had
taken
their
departure
for
bath
and
from
thence
were
expected
to
go
to
town
then
somewhat
later
came
the
news
that
scrope
hall
was
to
let
and
that
the
baronet
had
taken
up
his
permanent
residence
in
london
it
may
here
be
noted
that
it
was
captain
nightshade
invariable
practice
to
limit
his
attentions
to
hard
cash
and
to
the
purse
of
the
traveller
by
chaise
or
coach
and
the
plethoric
of
the
wealthy
landowner
on
its
way
to
or
from
the
local
bank
watches
rings
and
other
trinkets
he
put
politely
aside
as
unconsidered
trifles
with
which
he
did
not
choose
to
concern
himself
dare
at
the
time
troubled
himself
no
further
about
sir
but
when
he
next
went
to
london
he
took
it
with
him
with
the
intention
of
ascertaining
sir
peter
address
and
forwarding
it
to
him
by
a
trusty
messenger
but
it
was
found
that
sir
peter
was
on
the
continent
and
when
dare
went
back
to
the
north
the
box
went
with
him
once
more
he
had
brought
the
box
to
town
hoping
on
this
occasion
to
be
able
to
rid
himself
of
it
but
before
he
had
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
the
news
of
evan
abduction
reached
him
and
he
at
once
hurried
off
to
chelsea
and
for
the
next
two
or
three
days
his
time
and
thoughts
were
taken
up
with
far
more
important
matters
than
the
baronet
meanwhile
with
the
carelessness
hardly
removed
from
recklessness
that
was
characteristic
of
him
he
carried
the
box
about
with
him
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
now
it
so
happened
that
in
the
course
of
the
forenoon
of
the
day
following
that
of
his
second
interview
with
miss
baynard
as
he
was
taking
a
short
cut
to
his
lodgings
through
one
of
the
narrow
and
not
over
savory
lanes
which
divided
holborn
from
the
strand
he
came
on
a
crowd
of
people
gathered
round
a
man
who
had
fallen
down
in
a
fit
either
real
or
simulated
dare
had
pushed
his
way
steadily
through
the
crowd
and
had
got
some
yards
beyond
it
when
some
instinct
so
to
call
it
caused
him
to
clap
his
hand
to
his
waistcoat
sir
jeweled
was
gone
for
geoffrey
dare
such
an
experience
was
certainly
a
novel
one
no
sooner
did
he
realize
his
loss
than
he
broke
into
a
cynical
but
not
unamused
laugh
confound
the
rogue
impudence
he
exclaimed
half
aloud
where
were
his
eyes
that
he
failed
to
recognize
a
gentleman
of
his
own
kidney
it
is
to
be
feared
that
he
will
find
himself
landed
at
tyburn
one
of
these
days
he
was
still
standing
with
his
hand
pressed
to
his
empty
pocket
and
staring
at
the
fluctuating
crowd
when
a
hand
was
laid
on
his
shoulder
and
a
voice
said
in
his
ear
what
the
matter
dare
you
look
as
if
you
had
just
lost
something
dare
turning
recognized
the
speaker
for
john
tipway
a
famous
bow
street
runner
whose
acquaintance
he
had
made
a
couple
of
days
before
when
reporting
the
abduction
of
the
young
heir
that
exactly
what
i
have
done
replied
dare
pocket
picked
eh
dare
nodded
anything
of
consequence
a
very
valuable
a
noted
neighborhood
this
for
petty
larceny
hardly
a
worse
anywhere
but
come
along
with
me
to
the
office
i
on
my
way
there
and
lodge
a
description
of
the
missing
property
who
knows
but
we
may
be
able
to
recover
it
for
you
from
the
pawnbroker
or
somewhere
else
dare
hesitated
and
well
he
might
considering
under
what
circumstances
the
box
had
come
into
his
possession
but
in
the
company
of
tipway
to
have
hesitated
over
a
matter
of
that
sort
would
have
tended
to
provoke
suspicion
and
that
was
what
he
could
not
afford
to
do
so
he
accompanied
the
runner
to
bow
street
not
without
a
certain
relish
for
the
comedy
of
the
situation
and
there
furnished
a
description
of
the
stolen
box
leaving
an
address
that
of
a
humble
lodging
in
a
back
street
in
bloomsbury
at
which
any
tidings
of
it
might
be
communicated
to
him
by
that
night
coach
he
started
for
the
north
in
order
to
take
up
the
quest
to
which
he
had
vowed
himself
about
a
fortnight
later
the
was
found
in
the
possession
of
a
who
had
been
arrested
for
another
offence
now
it
so
fell
out
that
sir
peter
warrendale
who
was
much
put
about
by
the
loss
of
his
box
although
he
had
himself
almost
thrust
it
into
the
hands
of
the
colonel
delnay
not
only
because
it
was
intrinsically
valuable
but
because
it
was
a
cherished
heirloom
had
on
his
arrival
in
town
some
weeks
after
his
encounter
with
the
highwayman
given
a
description
of
it
at
bow
street
on
the
faint
chance
that
it
might
turn
up
at
one
of
the
london
pawnshops
or
in
some
other
fashion
a
peculiarity
of
the
box
was
that
it
had
a
false
bottom
a
fact
which
dare
had
failed
to
discover
but
it
was
a
feature
which
sir
peter
in
his
account
of
the
box
had
not
forgotten
to
specify
so
that
the
bow
street
official
who
happened
to
be
blessed
with
a
good
memory
found
himself
in
possession
of
an
article
which
was
claimed
by
two
different
owners
and
was
stated
to
have
been
stolen
from
both
sir
peter
warrendale
was
communicated
with
and
at
once
identified
the
box
as
his
property
and
explained
the
mystery
of
the
false
bottom
under
which
lay
a
miniature
of
his
when
a
beauty
of
eighteen
the
question
that
now
put
itself
was
by
what
means
had
the
box
come
into
dare
possession
it
was
a
question
which
only
himself
could
answer
so
a
messenger
was
sent
to
his
lodgings
with
a
request
that
he
would
go
to
bow
street
and
identify
the
box
but
dare
was
not
there
and
all
the
information
his
landlady
could
supply
was
that
he
had
gone
into
the
country
and
that
the
date
of
his
return
was
uncertain
accordingly
a
message
was
left
requesting
his
presence
at
bow
street
immediately
upon
his
return
to
town
meanwhile
the
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
authorities
chapter
xxi
in
quest
of
the
missing
heir
geoffrey
dare
alighted
from
the
london
coach
at
tuxford
a
small
some
half
dozen
miles
from
uplands
next
morning
he
set
about
making
certain
inquiries
which
resulted
in
his
ascertaining
that
uplands
was
now
empty
and
to
let
and
that
bullivant
had
transferred
herself
and
her
belongings
to
a
much
smaller
house
known
as
homecroft
about
twenty
miles
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
country
the
nearest
town
to
homecroft
was
broxham
a
place
of
some
twelve
thousand
inhabitants
and
thither
dare
lost
no
time
in
betaking
himself
after
breakfast
next
morning
he
hired
a
horse
and
started
for
a
long
ride
when
he
got
back
in
the
early
evening
he
had
learnt
a
good
deal
more
about
homecroft
than
he
knew
when
he
set
out
whether
the
particulars
thus
gathered
by
him
would
prove
of
any
after
use
it
was
too
early
to
determine
in
point
of
fact
he
had
not
yet
decided
upon
his
course
of
action
the
subject
was
one
which
needed
careful
consideration
if
a
fiasco
were
to
be
avoided
and
just
then
he
was
turning
it
over
and
over
in
his
mind
next
day
was
broxham
horse
and
cattle
fair
and
from
early
morn
till
late
at
night
the
little
town
was
a
busy
scene
in
which
business
and
pleasure
were
strangely
commingled
dare
was
a
lover
of
horseflesh
and
he
found
much
to
interest
him
in
a
casual
way
as
he
strolled
idly
about
the
fair
mentally
chewing
over
the
question
of
what
his
next
step
ought
to
be
in
the
undertaking
to
which
he
had
bound
himself
in
those
days
even
more
than
now
a
horse
fair
acted
as
a
sure
magnet
for
bringing
together
a
small
crowd
of
gypsies
and
certainly
there
was
no
lack
of
them
on
this
occasion
at
broxham
dare
had
come
across
a
couple
of
their
encampments
while
riding
out
the
day
before
but
it
was
not
till
when
as
he
stood
on
the
fringe
of
the
crowd
listening
to
the
chaffering
and
bargaining
but
thinking
of
other
things
a
smiling
sidled
up
to
him
and
asked
him
to
cross
her
hand
with
a
bit
of
silver
that
of
a
sudden
an
idea
came
to
him
which
seemed
to
open
up
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
with
which
he
had
been
perplexing
his
brain
ever
since
he
left
london
if
dare
crossed
the
girl
hand
with
a
piece
of
silver
it
was
not
with
the
view
of
having
his
fortune
told
drawing
her
further
apart
from
the
crowd
he
stood
in
earnest
talk
with
her
for
several
minutes
nor
did
they
part
till
they
had
come
to
a
mutual
understanding
last
words
to
the
girl
were
tell
your
father
that
he
may
expect
to
see
me
at
dusk
dare
was
not
unacquainted
with
romany
life
and
romany
ways
as
a
lad
of
seventeen
he
had
once
spent
a
month
of
at
one
of
their
encampments
and
the
knowledge
then
acquired
by
him
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
turn
to
good
account
on
the
present
occasion
not
till
the
sun
had
dipped
below
the
horizon
did
he
set
out
next
afternoon
to
walk
the
couple
of
miles
or
more
which
would
bring
him
to
a
certain
hollow
among
the
moors
where
a
number
of
gypsies
whom
the
fair
had
brought
into
the
neighborhood
had
made
their
temporary
home
he
had
got
about
halfway
and
was
on
the
point
of
turning
off
the
which
was
here
unfenced
and
open
to
the
moors
on
both
sides
at
a
place
previously
described
to
him
when
he
was
suddenly
confronted
by
a
man
who
started
up
from
behind
a
thick
clump
of
brambles
dare
came
to
a
halt
and
for
a
few
moments
the
two
stood
measuring
each
other
in
silence
the
stranger
an
unmistakable
gypsy
was
the
first
to
speak
you
are
the
that
had
something
to
say
to
my
daughter
yesterday
at
the
fair
i
am
and
you
want
her
with
my
leave
to
do
something
for
you
for
which
you
are
willing
to
pay
us
in
good
red
gold
you
could
not
have
put
the
case
in
fewer
words
well
here
we
are
with
only
the
rising
moon
and
our
own
shadows
for
company
we
could
not
have
a
better
chance
for
saying
what
is
to
be
said
nothing
could
have
suited
dare
purpose
better
the
or
proceeded
to
charge
and
light
his
pipe
while
dare
refreshed
himself
with
a
copious
pinch
of
snuff
then
by
the
light
of
the
young
moon
as
they
slowly
paced
the
soft
turf
to
and
fro
the
latter
went
on
to
unfold
his
wishes
about
a
mile
on
the
other
side
of
broxham
there
stands
in
its
own
grounds
a
small
country
house
the
name
of
which
is
homecroft
after
remaining
empty
for
a
long
time
it
has
now
found
a
tenant
in
the
person
of
bullivant
whose
husband
died
a
few
years
ago
and
whose
one
child
a
boy
of
five
or
six
is
at
present
from
home
most
probably
on
a
visit
to
his
grandfather
lord
cossington
now
although
her
own
child
is
away
i
have
strong
reasons
for
believing
that
bullivant
has
another
child
who
has
been
stolen
away
from
his
friends
hidden
in
the
house
whose
presence
there
is
only
known
to
the
herself
and
two
or
three
of
her
domestics
so
what
i
want
to
have
found
out
for
me
is
whether
there
is
or
is
not
such
a
child
as
the
one
i
speak
of
under
the
roof
of
homecroft
and
the
first
question
is
whether
your
daughter
can
obtain
that
information
for
me
without
arousing
any
suspicion
on
the
part
of
bullivant
or
any
of
her
people
to
this
the
gypsy
whose
name
was
enoch
bosworth
replied
that
he
had
very
little
doubt
his
daughter
rosilla
could
manage
to
obtain
the
required
information
if
time
were
allowed
her
and
she
was
allowed
to
go
to
work
in
her
own
way
in
the
affair
dare
did
not
care
how
she
went
to
work
so
long
as
she
got
him
the
needed
particulars
it
then
became
a
question
of
terms
between
the
two
men
and
these
having
been
satisfactorily
arranged
they
parted
with
an
agreement
to
meet
again
at
the
same
hour
and
place
four
evenings
later
although
dare
kept
his
appointment
to
the
minute
he
found
the
and
his
daughter
waiting
for
him
and
it
soon
appeared
that
rosilla
had
indeed
made
good
use
of
her
time
she
was
already
in
a
position
to
assure
him
that
his
belief
in
the
presence
of
a
strange
child
at
homecroft
was
amply
justified
such
a
child
was
there
a
boy
with
regard
to
whom
none
of
the
domestics
knew
anything
neither
his
name
where
he
came
from
the
connection
between
him
and
the
mistress
of
homecroft
or
in
point
of
fact
why
he
was
there
at
all
a
woman
who
had
been
in
bullivant
service
for
a
number
of
years
was
his
sole
attendant
and
none
of
the
other
servants
were
ever
allowed
to
speak
to
him
not
that
much
chance
of
doing
so
was
given
them
a
couple
of
rooms
having
been
set
apart
for
the
boy
and
the
woman
into
which
they
were
forbidden
to
penetrate
all
this
information
the
artful
rosilla
in
the
exercise
of
her
calling
as
a
had
succeeded
in
worming
out
of
bullivant
maid
a
girl
of
the
name
of
moggy
dredge
who
for
some
reason
or
other
had
conceived
a
violent
dislike
for
her
mistress
an
admission
of
which
dare
did
not
fail
to
see
the
importance
he
must
contrive
an
interview
with
the
girl
dredge
and
this
rosilla
was
commissioned
to
arrange
for
if
bullivant
maid
would
name
her
own
time
and
place
for
meeting
a
certain
gentleman
name
unknown
and
there
answer
a
few
questions
he
would
put
to
her
having
no
reference
to
herself
or
her
own
business
she
would
find
her
pocket
the
richer
by
a
couple
of
guineas
rosilla
at
once
undertook
to
do
her
best
to
arrange
the
meeting
in
question
which
took
place
a
couple
evenings
later
at
a
solitary
spot
a
little
way
outside
the
palings
of
the
homecroft
grounds
the
of
her
own
accord
went
a
little
way
apart
out
of
hearing
while
the
and
the
said
what
they
had
to
say
to
each
other
even
before
she
quite
comprehended
what
it
was
dare
wanted
her
to
do
moggy
did
not
hesitate
to
confess
that
in
her
own
words
she
hated
her
mistress
worse
than
poison
and
that
because
of
the
treatment
of
her
and
of
the
insults
she
saw
fit
to
heap
upon
her
in
reply
to
this
dare
very
naturally
asked
her
why
she
did
not
leave
bullivant
and
go
into
service
elsewhere
thereupon
moggy
burst
out
crying
and
after
sobbing
quietly
for
a
little
while
confided
to
dare
that
she
had
had
a
misfortune
and
had
thereby
forfeited
her
character
and
that
it
was
bullivant
knowledge
of
this
fact
which
enabled
her
to
trample
on
the
unhappy
girl
in
the
way
she
did
moggy
could
tell
dare
little
more
about
the
strange
child
than
he
had
already
learnt
from
rosilla
nor
had
he
expected
that
she
would
be
able
to
do
so
what
he
had
now
to
arrange
for
was
the
future
and
he
did
not
part
from
the
girl
till
she
had
given
him
her
promise
to
furnish
him
daily
with
a
written
report
of
everything
she
could
hear
or
gather
having
reference
to
the
child
this
report
she
was
to
place
each
day
after
nightfall
in
the
hollow
of
a
certain
tree
whence
it
would
be
fetched
by
rosilla
who
would
play
the
part
of
messenger
between
her
and
dare
later
there
would
be
three
more
guineas
for
her
and
she
confessed
that
she
was
badly
in
need
of
money
to
help
to
pay
for
the
keep
of
her
child
moggy
kept
her
promise
and
night
after
night
dare
received
at
the
hands
of
the
her
brief
and
reports
the
writing
of
which
caused
her
many
groans
and
was
the
cause
of
much
perturbation
of
spirit
but
it
was
not
till
ten
days
had
gone
by
that
she
found
anything
of
consequence
to
communicate
then
indeed
her
news
was
of
a
sufficiently
startling
kind
it
had
been
arranged
moggy
wrote
that
balchin
the
attendant
together
with
her
husband
who
was
coachman
were
to
start
next
evening
for
liverpool
on
their
way
to
america
the
report
being
that
by
the
death
of
a
relative
in
the
states
they
had
come
in
for
a
small
fortune
which
however
could
not
be
paid
over
to
them
without
their
presence
on
the
spot
but
it
was
not
till
dare
had
got
nearly
to
the
end
of
moggy
effusion
he
was
painfully
deciphering
it
in
his
room
at
the
inn
by
the
light
of
a
solitary
candle
that
of
a
sudden
he
sat
up
and
gave
vent
to
a
low
whistle
the
child
the
mysterious
child
about
whom
none
of
the
servants
at
homecraft
knew
anything
was
to
accompany
the
balchins
on
their
long
journey
a
journey
in
those
days
infinitely
more
formidable
than
it
is
now
the
little
party
of
three
were
to
leave
homecraft
in
carriage
at
eight
so
as
to
reach
tuxford
in
time
to
catch
the
night
coach
bound
for
the
south
dare
sat
for
some
time
staring
at
the
letter
but
without
seeing
it
when
he
had
succeeded
in
mastering
its
contents
what
step
ought
he
to
take
next
was
the
question
he
was
revolving
in
his
brain
and
for
some
time
no
satisfactory
answer
was
forthcoming
of
course
all
along
he
had
been
without
any
absolute
certainty
that
the
child
in
question
was
young
evan
cortelyon
morally
sure
he
might
be
but
that
was
hardly
foundation
enough
on
which
to
base
any
action
of
a
definite
kind
if
he
were
to
go
to
piljoy
and
state
his
conviction
in
the
matter
what
could
the
lawyer
do
at
present
no
evidence
was
available
conclusive
enough
to
justify
an
application
for
a
warrant
especially
against
a
person
of
the
social
standing
of
the
hon
bullivant
and
yet
if
the
child
were
really
evan
as
to
which
he
felt
no
sort
of
doubt
in
his
own
mind
then
must
he
be
rescued
at
every
cost
for
a
full
hour
he
sat
with
bent
brows
excogitating
one
scheme
after
another
only
to
reject
each
in
turn
till
he
had
worked
round
to
the
notion
which
had
struck
him
first
of
all
but
which
he
had
put
temporarily
aside
till
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
no
other
plan
was
equally
feasible
at
length
he
rose
abruptly
and
pushed
back
his
chair
is
the
only
way
he
said
aloud
was
the
first
notion
that
came
to
me
and
if
i
had
only
had
the
sense
to
embrace
it
there
and
then
i
might
have
saved
myself
all
this
useless
muddling
of
my
brains
a
year
ago
nay
far
later
than
that
i
should
not
have
hesitated
a
moment
but
now
what
has
come
over
me
what
strange
change
has
been
at
work
within
me
is
that
a
conundrum
very
hard
to
crack
geoff
my
boy
it
may
be
true
after
all
that
the
moon
is
made
of
green
cheese
chapter
xxii
the
hon
bullivant
to
captain
ferris
my
dear
wilton
wrote
bullivant
to
her
a
couple
of
days
subsequently
to
the
events
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
i
have
some
very
singular
news
for
you
which
i
lose
no
time
in
communicating
but
whether
bearing
in
mind
the
peculiar
features
of
the
case
you
will
be
inclined
to
stigmatize
it
as
bad
news
or
to
bless
it
as
good
seems
to
me
somewhat
problematical
and
i
at
once
confess
that
i
am
myself
at
a
loss
to
know
in
which
light
to
regard
it
although
my
disappointment
in
the
matter
of
cortelyon
will
was
so
extreme
as
almost
for
a
time
to
drive
me
beyond
myself
and
to
stir
up
within
me
feelings
and
passions
to
which
i
had
been
a
stranger
aforetime
and
although
i
took
a
silent
oath
that
come
what
might
i
would
be
revenged
for
what
i
then
regarded
and
still
regard
as
the
vile
trick
of
which
i
was
made
the
victim
yet
am
i
inclined
to
think
that
had
it
not
been
for
your
persistent
fanning
of
the
flame
which
just
then
burnt
so
fiercely
within
me
my
passion
would
gradually
have
cooled
down
my
reason
would
have
again
found
its
equipoise
and
i
should
never
have
given
my
sanction
to
a
certain
step
the
rashness
and
futility
of
which
i
recognized
almost
from
the
moment
of
agreeing
to
it
mind
in
writing
this
i
am
not
imputing
any
blame
to
you
or
if
there
is
any
we
share
it
on
equal
terms
your
own
disappointment
was
bitter
enough
in
all
conscience
to
goad
you
on
to
do
things
from
which
at
another
time
and
in
your
calmer
moments
you
would
have
turned
away
as
being
not
merely
useless
but
impolitic
from
the
moment
you
placed
young
cortelyon
in
my
hands
my
almost
insane
longing
to
be
revenged
for
the
foul
wrong
his
grandfather
had
done
me
slackened
and
grew
faint
and
i
recognized
with
overwhelming
clearness
what
a
blunder
we
had
made
and
with
what
a
burden
i
had
saddled
myself
now
that
i
had
got
the
child
into
my
keeping
what
was
i
to
do
with
him
there
was
the
rub
as
for
carrying
out
the
dark
hint
you
one
day
let
drop
only
by
way
of
trying
me
i
feel
sure
and
with
no
thought
that
i
would
agree
to
act
on
it
as
you
know
i
shrank
from
it
aghast
i
have
a
child
of
my
own
and
i
could
not
forget
it
and
little
cause
as
i
had
to
love
young
whatever
else
might
happen
to
him
his
life
was
absolutely
safe
so
long
as
he
remained
under
my
roof
but
the
perplexing
question
of
how
to
dispose
of
him
was
one
which
allowed
me
no
rest
as
you
are
aware
from
the
date
of
the
lad
arrival
at
homecroft
i
put
him
into
the
sole
charge
of
balchin
whom
as
i
have
good
reason
for
knowing
i
can
thoroughly
trust
and
kept
him
wholly
secluded
from
the
rest
of
the
household
for
whose
benefit
i
invented
a
little
fable
explanatory
of
my
reasons
for
acting
as
i
did
but
to
what
extent
they
believed
it
i
have
no
means
of
knowing
if
i
had
been
uncomfortable
before
you
may
imagine
what
effect
your
letter
had
on
me
in
which
you
informed
me
that
a
reward
of
five
hundred
pounds
was
offered
for
the
recovery
of
the
missing
heir
for
the
next
few
days
i
was
like
a
distracted
woman
turning
over
in
my
mind
a
dozen
schemes
each
one
more
wild
and
impracticable
than
the
last
then
all
at
once
the
black
clouds
opened
and
a
way
of
escape
lay
clear
before
me
as
i
daresay
you
may
remember
not
only
balchin
but
her
husband
is
in
my
service
the
latter
having
acted
as
my
coachman
ever
since
my
marriage
well
a
few
mornings
ago
balchin
received
a
letter
from
a
firm
of
lawyers
in
new
york
informing
him
that
a
legacy
equivalent
to
five
hundred
pounds
of
english
money
had
been
left
him
by
an
uncle
lately
deceased
but
that
it
would
be
requisite
for
him
to
go
over
to
the
states
and
be
prepared
to
prove
his
identity
before
the
money
could
be
paid
him
when
he
came
to
me
and
showed
me
his
letter
and
told
me
all
this
i
could
have
found
it
in
my
heart
to
embrace
him
can
you
guess
cher
what
were
the
first
words
i
said
to
myself
they
were
these
wife
shall
keep
him
company
on
the
voyage
and
with
them
they
shall
take
young
cortelyon
they
shall
come
back
alone
there
is
no
need
to
trouble
you
with
details
it
will
be
enough
to
state
that
by
the
evening
of
the
second
day
after
balchin
receipt
of
the
letter
all
arrangements
had
been
made
and
the
little
party
of
three
were
ready
to
start
they
were
to
have
the
use
of
my
carriage
as
far
as
tuxford
where
they
would
join
the
night
coach
for
the
south
on
their
way
to
liverpool
from
which
port
they
would
sail
by
the
first
available
packet
for
new
york
balchin
is
a
capable
man
and
i
had
no
fear
about
his
failing
to
carry
out
the
instructions
laid
down
for
him
of
course
the
expenses
of
the
journey
so
far
as
his
wife
and
the
child
were
concerned
were
to
be
defrayed
by
me
i
ought
to
mention
here
that
i
had
often
heard
balchin
refer
to
her
numerous
clan
of
cousins
in
america
and
when
i
put
the
case
before
her
she
readily
engaged
for
a
hundred
pounds
paid
down
to
get
the
boy
permanently
adopted
by
one
of
them
as
you
know
i
could
ill
spare
any
such
sum
but
i
would
have
made
a
still
greater
sacrifice
rather
than
let
the
opportunity
go
by
of
ridding
myself
of
what
had
latterly
become
the
incubus
of
my
life
the
clocks
were
striking
nine
when
they
started
which
would
leave
them
an
hour
and
for
the
journey
to
tuxford
balchin
was
on
the
box
with
the
beside
him
whom
it
was
necessary
to
take
in
order
that
he
might
bring
back
the
carriage
inside
were
balchin
and
the
child
the
latter
soundly
asleep
under
the
influence
of
a
narcotic
you
can
but
faintly
imagine
with
what
an
intense
feeling
of
relief
i
watched
the
carriage
disappear
in
the
soft
darkness
of
the
autumn
night
you
will
be
wondering
by
this
time
as
to
the
nature
of
the
singular
news
which
i
began
this
letter
by
telling
you
i
had
to
communicate
you
shall
now
be
told
it
what
i
have
written
so
far
being
merely
the
needful
introduction
thereto
imagine
then
if
you
can
my
feelings
of
mingled
amazement
and
alarm
when
shortly
after
ten
my
maid
came
to
tell
me
that
the
carriage
had
just
returned
and
that
balchin
was
very
anxious
to
speak
to
me
i
ordered
him
to
be
at
once
admitted
and
the
moment
i
set
eyes
on
his
face
i
knew
that
something
had
gone
amiss
although
the
mere
fact
of
his
presence
there
was
enough
to
convince
me
on
that
point
without
giving
him
time
to
speak
i
said
quickly
is
the
child
nothing
has
happened
to
him
i
hope
this
that
we
been
robbed
of
him
was
his
reply
and
so
it
proved
to
be
as
they
were
crossing
blaydon
heath
they
had
been
stopped
by
a
masked
horseman
carrying
a
pistol
in
one
hand
and
a
small
lantern
in
the
other
who
had
bidden
balchin
bring
the
carriage
to
a
halt
on
pain
of
instant
death
naturally
the
man
was
much
frightened
seeing
that
in
his
wife
purse
was
not
merely
the
for
all
three
but
the
hundred
pounds
given
by
me
for
the
purpose
just
named
but
in
that
respect
his
fears
proved
to
be
unfounded
riding
up
to
the
carriage
window
the
horseman
first
turned
his
lantern
full
on
balchin
and
then
on
the
face
of
the
sleeping
child
i
thought
madam
as
i
thought
he
said
find
you
here
in
possession
of
property
which
does
not
belong
to
you
with
your
good
pleasure
i
will
relieve
you
of
it
nay
no
demur
or
you
will
find
it
the
worse
for
you
allow
me
to
remind
you
is
a
crime
punishable
with
a
long
term
of
transportation
hand
the
boy
over
to
me
at
once
and
thank
your
lucky
stars
that
you
are
allowed
to
escape
so
easily
illustration
the
compliments
of
captain
nightshade
what
could
the
woman
do
but
comply
indeed
as
she
has
since
told
me
she
was
nearly
frightened
out
of
her
wits
without
dismounting
the
horseman
opened
the
carriage
door
and
the
child
still
sleeping
soundly
was
transferred
to
him
placing
the
boy
in
front
of
him
with
one
arm
round
him
he
backed
his
horse
from
the
carriage
and
then
addressing
balchin
said
can
drive
back
home
and
when
you
get
there
give
my
compliments
to
your
mistress
the
compliments
of
captain
nightshade
and
tell
her
she
ought
to
go
down
on
her
knees
and
thank
me
for
having
saved
her
from
the
consequences
of
a
most
shameful
crime
with
that
he
waved
his
hand
set
spur
to
his
horse
and
cantered
off
such
was
the
story
brought
back
by
balchin
captain
nightshade
i
must
tell
you
is
a
notorious
highwayman
who
for
two
or
three
years
past
has
been
the
terror
of
this
part
of
england
for
the
last
six
or
seven
months
however
nothing
has
been
heard
of
him
and
everybody
was
hoping
that
he
had
seen
fit
to
transfer
his
attentions
elsewhere
now
tell
me
this
if
you
can
how
did
he
of
all
people
in
the
world
succeed
in
discovering
that
young
was
hidden
under
my
roof
and
that
he
was
about
to
be
smuggled
away
at
that
particular
time
it
is
a
question
which
the
oftener
i
ask
it
the
more
bewildered
i
become
somebody
must
have
acted
the
part
of
spy
and
traitor
but
who
is
that
somebody
and
through
what
mysterious
channel
did
he
or
she
succeed
in
communicating
my
intentions
to
the
highwayman
i
have
my
suspicions
in
the
matter
but
i
refrain
from
inflicting
them
upon
you
captain
nightshade
motive
in
getting
hold
of
the
boy
is
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
he
will
restore
him
to
his
friends
and
claim
the
reward
offered
for
his
recovery
and
after
such
an
ignominious
fashion
has
the
scheme
of
revenge
hatched
by
you
and
in
a
weak
moment
acceded
to
by
me
collapsed
and
crumbled
to
pieces
that
i
should
ever
have
allowed
myself
to
be
mixed
up
with
any
such
affair
seems
to
me
writing
now
wholly
inconceivable
but
it
merely
serves
to
prove
to
what
lengths
a
woman
will
go
when
blinded
by
passion
spite
and
the
overthrow
of
her
most
cherished
hopes
somehow
i
have
not
much
fear
that
the
friends
of
young
even
should
the
facts
of
the
case
be
made
known
to
them
will
take
any
further
steps
in
the
affair
they
will
not
i
am
quite
sure
if
miss
baynard
has
any
say
in
the
affair
i
could
love
that
girl
wilton
were
it
in
my
nature
to
love
anybody
and
to
think
that
not
a
shilling
of
her
wealth
will
come
to
her
it
is
most
shameful
but
enough
i
am
tired
and
must
leave
till
another
day
my
answers
to
certain
questions
which
you
ask
in
your
last
letter
your
affectionate
sister
onoria
bullivant
chapter
xxiii
a
joyful
surprise
all
this
time
miss
baynard
was
waiting
at
stanbrook
for
the
news
which
seemed
so
long
in
coming
as
one
slow
day
followed
another
without
bringing
the
tidings
her
heart
grew
sick
within
her
perhaps
the
boy
had
been
spirited
out
of
the
country
and
she
should
never
set
eyes
on
him
again
perhaps
something
worse
even
than
that
had
befallen
him
piljoy
came
over
on
business
connected
with
the
estate
but
brought
no
comfort
with
him
till
some
tidings
of
the
missing
heir
should
come
to
hand
no
steps
whatever
could
be
taken
with
reference
to
the
settlement
of
the
property
after
his
receipt
of
nell
letter
containing
the
news
of
the
abduction
he
had
communicated
direct
with
the
authorities
in
london
but
beyond
a
reply
to
the
effect
that
the
case
was
already
in
hand
and
having
their
best
attention
he
had
heard
nothing
he
had
more
than
one
question
to
put
to
miss
baynard
having
reference
to
geoffrey
dare
to
which
she
contented
herself
with
replying
that
dare
had
been
her
cousin
bosom
friend
and
was
the
missing
godfather
and
had
promised
poor
dick
to
look
after
him
as
if
he
were
his
own
son
what
would
have
been
piljoy
horror
and
amazement
had
he
been
told
that
geoffrey
dare
and
the
notorious
captain
nightshade
were
one
and
the
same
person
nell
could
not
help
laughing
a
little
to
herself
as
her
imagination
conjured
up
the
picture
but
our
heroine
state
of
suspense
was
not
destined
to
last
much
longer
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
after
piljoy
return
home
a
letter
was
brought
her
which
caused
her
to
start
with
amazement
the
moment
her
eyes
fell
on
it
the
address
was
in
the
same
writing
as
that
of
the
packet
in
which
her
lost
mask
had
been
returned
to
her
for
a
space
of
some
seconds
she
stood
staring
at
it
like
one
fascinated
then
with
fingers
that
shook
a
little
she
broke
the
seal
and
tore
open
the
letter
here
is
what
she
read
presents
his
compliments
to
miss
baynard
and
has
much
happiness
in
informing
her
that
news
has
reached
him
not
only
of
the
safety
but
of
the
whereabouts
of
her
young
relative
master
evan
cortelyon
should
miss
baynard
think
it
worth
her
while
to
come
as
far
as
rockmount
ellerslie
will
be
pleased
to
tell
her
all
that
has
come
to
his
knowledge
in
connection
with
the
affair
in
which
case
the
bearer
of
this
letter
is
instructed
to
act
as
her
guide
and
escort
on
the
journey
she
could
hardly
make
out
the
last
few
lines
for
the
happy
tears
which
already
dimmed
her
eyes
and
so
had
to
read
them
again
go
to
rockmount
of
course
she
would
had
it
been
to
the
end
of
europe
she
would
have
gone
and
ten
minutes
later
she
was
ready
to
start
day
was
already
drawing
to
dusk
and
budd
would
fain
have
persuaded
her
to
put
off
her
journey
till
morning
but
timid
counsels
had
never
prevailed
with
nell
and
it
was
not
in
the
least
likely
that
they
would
in
a
case
like
the
present
she
had
at
once
sent
word
to
have
her
mare
saddled
and
brought
round
and
it
was
waiting
for
her
in
charge
of
john
dyce
by
the
time
she
was
ready
nell
was
hardly
surprised
at
finding
that
the
man
who
had
brought
the
letter
and
who
was
waiting
for
an
answer
to
it
was
the
one
who
on
the
occasion
of
her
first
sojourn
at
rockmount
had
acted
as
her
guide
as
far
as
the
whinbarrow
road
would
he
recognize
in
her
the
young
spark
whom
he
had
then
escorted
it
seemed
hardly
likely
that
he
would
and
in
any
case
it
did
not
matter
greatly
it
was
far
more
probable
that
he
would
recognize
her
mare
peggy
i
am
going
back
with
you
to
rockmount
she
said
to
him
all
right
mum
he
replied
with
a
tug
at
his
forelock
you
could
have
a
finer
evenin
for
a
ride
neither
man
nor
horse
had
lacked
for
refreshment
while
waiting
and
so
presently
they
set
out
miss
baynard
leading
the
way
by
about
a
dozen
yards
this
lasted
till
they
had
gone
some
six
or
eight
miles
and
had
reached
a
point
where
it
became
necessary
to
diverge
from
the
great
highway
they
had
hitherto
been
traversing
and
take
to
one
of
the
tortuous
roads
which
branched
off
into
the
desolate
region
of
fells
and
moors
then
the
position
of
the
two
was
reversed
and
it
was
the
man
who
led
the
way
it
was
quite
dark
by
the
time
they
reached
rockmount
or
as
nearly
so
as
it
ever
is
on
a
clear
starlit
autumnal
night
as
miss
baynard
drew
rein
in
front
of
the
house
her
mind
was
busy
with
the
incidents
of
that
other
night
now
many
months
old
when
one
whom
she
had
since
learnt
to
love
in
secret
with
all
the
fervency
of
a
first
great
passion
had
brought
her
to
the
door
of
rockmount
and
had
there
left
her
how
full
of
incident
for
her
those
months
had
been
what
a
changed
life
both
inwardly
and
outwardly
had
hers
become
between
then
and
now
her
guide
having
dismounted
gave
a
resounding
knock
on
the
great
oaken
door
and
then
helped
miss
baynard
to
alight
when
that
was
done
he
led
the
horses
away
towards
the
back
premises
and
the
same
instant
there
was
the
sound
of
bolts
and
bars
being
unloosened
one
by
one
so
remote
and
lonely
was
the
house
that
it
was
no
wonder
the
inmates
looked
carefully
to
their
fastenings
then
the
door
was
opened
disclosing
the
same
old
carrying
a
lighted
candle
whom
nell
had
seen
on
the
first
occasion
be
good
enough
to
tell
your
master
that
miss
baynard
is
here
she
said
making
an
arch
of
one
of
his
knotted
hands
he
peered
at
her
for
a
moment
or
two
from
under
it
then
he
said
the
master
is
expecting
yo
will
yo
be
pleased
to
come
in
and
so
for
the
second
time
nell
crossed
the
threshold
of
rockmount
the
door
having
been
shut
behind
her
the
old
fellow
led
the
way
across
the
hall
and
so
brought
her
presently
to
the
same
sparsely
furnished
room
with
which
she
was
already
so
well
acquainted
then
she
was
left
alone
as
nell
looked
round
the
room
she
could
have
fancied
that
only
a
few
hours
had
gone
by
since
she
was
last
there
the
candles
were
alight
a
cheerful
fire
was
burning
in
the
grate
the
heavy
curtains
of
faded
red
moreen
were
closely
drawn
nothing
was
changed
from
moment
to
moment
she
looked
to
see
enter
would
he
when
they
met
treat
her
as
a
stranger
or
as
one
whom
he
knew
already
it
was
a
question
she
had
asked
herself
more
than
once
while
on
her
way
to
rockmount
that
he
knew
the
pseudo
frank
nevill
to
be
none
other
than
miss
baynard
of
stanbrook
he
had
himself
furnished
her
with
proof
positive
in
the
return
of
her
mask
but
did
he
know
at
the
time
he
gave
her
a
night
lodging
who
she
was
or
did
he
not
discover
it
till
afterwards
and
in
either
case
by
what
mysterious
means
had
he
made
the
discovery
she
had
not
forgotten
nor
was
it
likely
she
should
forget
that
in
the
chamber
assigned
her
at
rockmount
she
had
found
a
certain
feminine
garment
but
whether
placed
there
by
accident
or
design
she
had
no
means
whatever
of
knowing
if
by
design
then
must
ellerslie
from
the
first
have
penetrated
the
secret
of
her
sex
it
was
a
thought
which
even
after
all
this
time
caused
the
blood
to
tingle
in
her
veins
but
these
questions
personal
to
herself
perplexing
though
they
were
did
not
cause
her
for
more
than
a
minute
or
two
at
a
time
to
lose
sight
of
the
main
object
which
had
brought
her
to
rockmount
while
wholly
at
a
loss
to
imagine
how
it
had
come
to
pass
that
the
first
news
of
the
lost
child
should
have
reached
her
through
ellerslie
and
neither
through
bow
street
nor
geoffrey
dare
not
that
it
mattered
greatly
so
long
as
news
of
him
had
come
to
hand
she
was
all
impatience
to
hear
what
ellerslie
had
to
tell
her
she
could
not
help
starting
when
the
door
opened
thinking
to
see
him
but
it
was
dobson
the
housekeeper
who
now
came
in
nell
had
by
no
means
forgotten
dobson
and
she
scrutinized
her
a
little
anxiously
would
the
housekeeper
recognize
her
would
there
be
anything
in
her
manner
to
betray
a
knowledge
of
their
having
ever
met
before
dobson
having
shut
the
door
came
forward
a
little
way
crossed
her
hands
in
front
of
her
and
made
miss
baynard
a
respectful
curtsey
then
their
eyes
met
and
nell
read
nothing
in
those
of
the
other
which
she
might
not
have
read
in
the
eyes
of
any
stranger
undisguised
admiration
they
betrayed
of
a
surety
but
to
that
our
young
lady
was
so
used
that
she
thought
nothing
of
it
madam
began
the
housekeeper
with
the
tone
and
manner
of
a
dependent
my
master
desires
me
to
say
that
in
another
room
there
is
a
very
charming
little
picture
a
view
of
which
he
feels
sure
would
please
you
vastly
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
accompany
me
i
will
conduct
you
to
it
miss
baynard
stared
at
the
housekeeper
with
eyes
a
picture
she
said
surely
ellerslie
has
not
asked
me
to
rockmount
merely
to
show
me
a
picture
that
is
more
than
i
can
say
miss
my
business
is
simply
to
repeat
my
master
message
but
i
feel
quite
sure
that
if
you
knew
what
the
picture
is
you
would
never
forgive
yourself
for
having
refused
to
see
it
do
come
miss
she
added
next
moment
seeing
that
miss
baynard
still
hesitated
very
well
i
will
go
with
you
said
nell
dobson
led
the
way
through
the
gloomy
old
house
to
a
bedroom
on
the
first
floor
but
not
the
one
occupied
by
miss
baynard
on
the
occasion
of
her
first
visit
to
rockmount
although
differing
very
little
from
it
in
its
furniture
and
appointments
except
in
one
particular
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
stood
a
couch
to
which
eyes
travelled
instinctively
the
moment
she
entered
the
room
it
had
been
made
up
temporarily
with
pillows
and
coverlets
so
as
to
form
a
child
bed
a
solitary
wax
candle
was
alight
on
the
a
low
inarticulate
cry
broke
from
nell
brushing
past
the
housekeeper
she
went
swiftly
forward
and
bent
over
the
couch
the
truth
had
flashed
across
her
as
she
set
foot
over
the
threshold
and
now
her
eyes
verified
it
there
in
rosy
slumber
his
cheek
pillowed
on
one
hand
the
other
arm
flung
with
graceful
abandon
outside
the
coverlet
lay
the
missing
child
this
was
the
picture
ellerslie
had
invited
her
to
come
and
see
tears
rushed
to
her
eyes
and
overbrimmed
them
a
sob
broke
in
her
throat
not
for
a
full
minute
for
fear
of
waking
him
did
she
venture
to
stoop
and
touch
the
of
his
cheek
with
her
lips
her
heart
was
full
and
not
till
a
few
more
moments
had
gone
by
would
she
trust
herself
to
speak
the
housekeeper
was
at
her
elbow
who
brought
him
and
how
long
has
he
been
here
she
asked
i
found
him
keeping
master
company
in
the
library
when
i
came
downstairs
this
morning
some
one
had
brought
him
in
the
course
of
the
night
he
has
been
playing
about
on
the
moors
a
good
part
of
the
day
not
of
course
without
some
one
to
look
after
him
and
came
to
bed
thoroughly
tired
out
what
a
dear
little
gentleman
he
is
not
a
bit
like
many
children
i
known
but
trying
to
make
friends
with
everybody
i
suppose
miss
that
you
wo
have
any
objection
to
sharing
this
room
with
him
miss
baynard
was
startled
but
i
have
not
seen
ellerslie
yet
she
objected
when
his
message
reached
me
my
only
aim
was
to
lose
no
time
in
getting
here
and
certainly
i
had
no
thought
or
intention
of
staying
the
night
at
rockmount
but
consider
the
lateness
of
the
hour
miss
and
you
would
hardly
care
i
should
think
to
have
the
child
wakened
in
order
to
take
him
a
long
journey
in
the
middle
of
the
night
no
i
certainly
should
not
care
for
that
but
when
i
left
home
i
did
not
know
that
evan
had
been
found
and
that
i
was
going
to
see
him
only
that
ellerslie
had
a
message
of
some
kind
for
me
which
concerned
him
well
miss
master
certainly
expects
you
to
stay
till
morning
and
asked
me
hours
ago
to
arrange
accordingly
but
most
likely
he
will
speak
to
you
himself
about
it
and
now
if
you
are
ready
we
will
go
downstairs
but
nell
could
not
go
without
another
kiss
he
is
not
left
alone
while
he
sleeps
remarked
dobson
as
they
left
the
room
my
niece
watches
by
him
downstairs
miss
baynard
found
the
table
laid
for
one
person
and
three
minutes
later
a
dainty
little
supper
was
brought
in
when
shall
i
see
mr
ellerslie
she
asked
as
the
housekeeper
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
room
he
will
do
himself
the
honor
of
waiting
upon
you
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
it
was
very
rarely
that
nell
appetite
failed
her
and
her
long
ride
through
the
night
air
had
if
anything
tended
to
sharpen
it
on
the
present
occasion
she
was
a
healthy
english
girl
who
came
of
a
healthy
stock
she
hardly
knew
that
she
had
such
things
as
nerves
she
was
neither
hysterical
nor
anæmic
nor
introspective
no
questions
troubled
her
because
the
century
was
yet
in
its
infancy
she
was
a
creature
somewhat
too
impulsive
perhaps
and
too
easily
led
away
by
her
own
generous
instincts
and
although
an
existence
such
as
hers
would
nowadays
be
regarded
as
intolerably
narrow
and
antiquated
yet
was
her
life
an
exemplar
of
several
of
those
minor
if
homely
virtues
with
which
so
many
of
our
young
women
profess
to
be
and
probably
are
wholly
unacquainted
and
to
regard
with
silent
contempt
at
any
rate
miss
baynard
did
full
justice
to
her
supper
scarcely
had
the
table
been
cleared
when
ellerslie
entered
the
room
to
nell
it
seemed
as
if
she
might
have
parted
from
him
no
longer
ago
than
the
day
before
so
wholly
unchanged
was
he
from
the
picture
of
him
which
still
lived
so
freshly
in
her
memory
there
was
the
long
grizzled
hair
parted
down
the
middle
the
short
vandyck
beard
and
moustache
the
black
velvet
skull
cap
and
the
dark
monkish
robe
which
wrapped
him
from
head
to
foot
there
too
was
the
set
face
with
its
thousands
of
fine
wrinkles
which
from
a
little
distance
looked
as
if
it
were
carved
out
of
old
ivory
a
face
which
seemed
to
emphasize
the
pair
of
brilliant
black
eyes
that
looked
out
from
under
their
heavy
penthouse
brows
with
an
illusive
something
in
them
which
reminded
nell
strangely
of
geoffrey
dare
as
he
entered
the
room
miss
baynard
rose
and
advanced
to
meet
him
with
both
hands
outstretched
oh
mr
ellerslie
she
said
and
in
her
voice
there
was
a
veiled
emotion
not
far
removed
from
tears
how
can
i
ever
thank
you
enough
how
ever
be
sufficiently
grateful
to
you
for
the
glad
surprise
you
have
given
me
this
evening
surely
you
must
be
a
necromancer
or
the
good
wizard
of
a
fairy
tale
for
to
me
it
seems
nothing
less
than
a
fairy
tale
to
have
one
i
hold
so
dear
restored
to
me
in
this
fashion
ellerslie
took
her
hands
in
his
bent
over
them
and
raised
them
for
a
second
to
his
lips
nay
nay
my
dear
young
lady
he
replied
if
any
thanks
be
due
in
the
matter
though
why
there
should
be
i
fail
to
see
then
must
they
fall
not
to
my
share
but
to
that
of
my
nephew
geoffrey
dare
an
involuntary
oh
broke
from
miss
baynard
his
nephew
it
was
a
revelation
which
seemed
to
throw
light
on
several
things
it
was
geoff
who
brought
the
child
here
at
a
late
hour
last
night
asleep
and
perched
on
his
horse
in
front
of
him
as
to
whom
where
and
how
he
picked
the
youngster
up
i
must
refer
you
to
him
in
person
but
when
shall
i
see
dare
is
he
not
here
at
present
he
is
not
some
business
called
him
away
in
the
course
of
the
day
but
i
have
his
promise
that
he
will
be
back
not
later
than
ten
morning
and
i
shall
see
him
then
certainly
you
will
my
dear
miss
baynard
he
will
be
here
immediately
after
breakfast
by
this
time
he
had
led
her
back
to
her
chair
and
had
seated
himself
in
another
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hearth
miss
baynard
hesitated
a
moment
then
she
said
when
i
left
stanbrook
in
consequence
of
your
message
ellerslie
it
was
certainly
without
any
design
of
staying
over
night
at
rockmount
but
my
dear
young
lady
as
circumstances
have
fallen
out
i
fail
to
see
how
you
can
very
well
help
yourself
that
is
to
say
unless
it
is
your
intention
to
leave
your
young
cousin
for
a
time
under
my
charge
a
charge
i
need
scarcely
tell
you
which
i
will
very
gladly
undertake
you
are
very
good
ellerslie
but
when
i
go
back
evan
must
go
with
me
then
permit
me
to
observe
that
putting
yourself
out
of
the
question
the
hour
is
far
too
late
a
one
for
the
child
to
travel
it
was
the
same
argument
the
housekeeper
had
made
use
of
besides
where
your
hurry
resumed
ellerslie
the
boy
is
restored
to
you
and
that
as
i
take
it
is
the
main
thing
the
but
leather
and
prunella
you
might
have
added
ellerslie
by
way
of
clinching
your
argument
that
it
would
not
be
the
first
time
i
have
slept
under
the
roof
of
rockmount
eh
exclaimed
ellerslie
with
a
palpable
start
a
certain
frank
nevill
sought
and
found
shelter
here
one
night
early
in
the
present
year
it
may
be
that
you
have
not
quite
forgotten
the
young
man
in
question
i
have
not
by
any
means
forgotten
him
furthermore
you
have
been
for
some
time
aware
for
how
long
i
do
not
know
that
the
aforesaid
nevill
and
miss
baynard
of
stanbrook
were
and
are
one
and
the
same
person
and
how
i
happen
to
know
this
i
will
now
make
clear
to
you
for
a
certain
reason
which
at
the
time
seemed
to
him
but
which
turned
to
foolishness
the
frank
nevill
chose
for
one
night
to
enact
the
part
of
an
amateur
highwayman
and
wound
up
his
adventure
by
accepting
the
hospitality
of
rockmount
on
quitting
here
next
morning
by
some
oversight
he
left
his
mask
behind
him
time
passed
on
and
when
three
or
four
months
had
gone
by
the
missing
mask
was
forwarded
through
the
post
to
miss
baynard
but
without
any
word
of
explanation
or
any
clue
to
the
sender
of
it
and
there
the
matter
rested
till
this
afternoon
when
miss
baynard
received
a
note
from
ellerslie
informing
her
that
he
had
certain
news
to
communicate
to
miss
the
writing
seemed
not
wholly
strange
and
on
comparing
it
with
the
address
on
the
sheet
of
paper
which
she
had
kept
in
which
the
mask
had
been
enclosed
she
could
not
doubt
that
they
had
both
emanated
from
one
pen
but
doubtless
much
of
this
is
old
news
to
you
ellerslie
to
dare
my
double
identity
has
for
some
time
been
no
secret
and
he
ellerslie
held
up
his
hand
pardon
me
not
even
to
me
would
my
nephew
speak
of
matters
which
involved
a
point
of
honor
between
himself
and
another
that
which
you
have
just
told
me
has
now
become
a
matter
of
little
or
no
moment
and
such
being
the
case
there
can
be
no
harm
in
my
confessing
that
the
identity
of
miss
baynard
with
frank
nevill
was
suspected
by
me
almost
from
the
first
why
was
the
same
mare
ridden
by
both
as
one
of
my
men
who
chanced
on
miss
baynard
next
day
when
on
her
way
back
to
stanbrook
averred
to
be
the
fact
but
it
was
my
housekeeper
who
was
the
first
to
raise
a
doubt
in
my
mind
with
regard
to
the
sex
of
frank
nevill
that
young
blade
had
not
been
ten
minutes
under
my
roof
before
she
came
to
me
and
said
may
take
my
word
for
it
sir
that
yon
young
gentleman
in
the
oak
parlor
is
no
more
a
gentleman
than
i
am
and
would
be
far
more
at
home
in
petticoats
than
in
what
he
wearing
now
evidently
dobson
knew
what
she
was
talking
about
she
is
a
woman
of
penetration
and
i
have
a
great
respect
for
her
chapter
xxiv
a
parting
and
a
letter
next
morning
miss
baynard
and
evan
breakfasted
alone
ellerslie
remaining
invisible
but
nell
who
was
becoming
accustomed
to
her
host
eccentricities
was
hardly
surprised
at
his
not
much
appetite
had
she
this
morning
dare
was
coming
at
ten
and
the
thought
of
her
forthcoming
interview
with
him
disturbed
her
strangely
they
were
about
to
part
when
she
had
given
expression
to
her
gratitude
and
they
had
taken
leave
of
each
other
and
she
had
gone
her
way
and
he
his
what
chance
or
likelihood
was
there
of
their
ever
meeting
again
by
his
own
confession
his
business
in
england
was
now
at
an
end
in
a
few
days
or
a
few
weeks
at
the
latest
he
would
have
left
its
shores
never
to
return
they
would
have
passed
out
of
each
other
life
and
except
for
one
thing
all
would
be
as
it
was
before
they
first
met
yes
save
and
except
for
one
thing
but
one
which
to
nell
made
all
imaginable
difference
then
she
had
held
her
heart
fast
in
her
own
keeping
but
what
had
become
of
the
poor
thing
now
she
had
given
it
away
without
having
been
asked
for
it
could
anything
be
more
shameful
it
was
gone
from
her
past
reclaiming
lost
to
her
forever
and
yet
he
into
whose
keeping
it
had
been
given
knew
nothing
about
it
and
he
never
would
know
he
would
carry
it
away
with
him
all
unwitting
and
to
all
outward
seeming
life
with
her
would
go
on
just
as
before
she
alone
would
know
that
she
had
lost
something
which
nothing
else
could
make
up
to
her
that
some
of
the
magic
had
faded
out
of
existence
and
that
the
sun
no
longer
shone
quite
so
brightly
as
it
had
been
used
to
do
hardly
had
the
clocks
struck
ten
when
there
came
a
tap
at
the
door
which
was
followed
by
the
entrance
of
geoffrey
dare
young
evan
was
on
the
floor
busied
with
some
toys
which
the
housekeeper
had
disinterred
for
him
out
of
one
of
the
garrets
the
moment
he
saw
who
the
newcomer
was
he
called
out
uncle
geoff
come
here
one
of
my
horses
has
only
got
three
legs
and
i
want
you
to
make
me
a
new
one
presently
my
dear
boy
presently
he
replied
as
after
pausing
for
a
moment
at
the
door
he
went
slowly
forward
his
eyes
fixed
full
on
miss
baynard
she
was
standing
supporting
herself
with
one
hand
on
the
table
and
with
the
other
pressed
to
her
side
for
a
little
space
her
gaze
met
his
without
the
flicker
of
an
eyelash
and
then
dropped
before
the
ardor
of
his
regard
her
heart
was
beating
tumultuously
while
the
quick
rise
and
fall
of
her
bosom
told
of
the
emotions
at
work
beneath
a
lovely
flush
suffused
both
face
and
throat
but
dare
was
paler
than
ordinary
and
haggard
and
and
might
have
just
risen
from
a
sick
bed
both
were
putting
a
strong
restraint
on
themselves
but
each
showed
it
in
a
different
way
nell
did
not
advance
with
impulsive
outstretched
hands
as
she
had
done
in
the
case
of
ellerslie
it
was
as
though
her
limbs
refused
to
move
under
her
but
when
dare
came
up
and
held
out
one
of
his
hands
she
laid
one
of
hers
in
it
readily
enough
it
did
not
take
long
to
bring
you
here
miss
baynard
he
said
when
once
you
knew
that
my
uncle
had
tidings
of
the
boy
after
pressing
her
hand
slightly
he
had
withdrawn
his
own
they
might
have
been
the
merest
casual
acquaintances
nell
felt
a
little
bitterly
and
yet
unless
her
feelings
had
blinded
her
as
he
entered
the
room
she
had
detected
in
his
eyes
a
flame
of
passionate
ardor
from
which
her
own
had
been
fain
to
shrink
abashed
could
it
be
that
he
was
hiding
something
from
her
even
as
she
was
hiding
something
from
him
as
this
question
flashed
across
her
she
raised
her
eyes
once
more
to
his
but
the
flame
which
had
so
dazzled
her
a
minute
before
was
no
longer
there
had
it
been
extinguished
or
was
it
merely
that
a
veil
had
been
temporarily
drawn
before
it
it
was
after
a
scarcely
observable
pause
that
she
answered
his
remark
you
may
be
sure
that
after
ellerslie
message
reached
me
i
let
no
grass
grow
under
my
feet
i
came
looking
to
have
merely
some
tidings
of
the
boy
whereas
it
was
evan
himself
whom
i
found
but
i
am
only
telling
you
what
you
know
already
when
i
began
to
thank
your
uncle
under
the
belief
that
i
owed
evan
recovery
to
him
he
stopped
me
it
seems
that
you
are
the
person
to
whom
my
thanks
are
due
believe
me
dare
they
are
yours
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
dare
bowed
not
a
word
more
on
that
score
i
beg
he
said
with
a
smile
i
need
not
tell
you
that
it
makes
me
very
happy
to
have
been
the
means
of
restoring
evan
to
you
but
as
you
are
aware
i
myself
have
a
strong
interest
in
the
boy
strong
enough
to
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
leave
a
stone
unturned
till
he
had
been
found
whether
by
me
or
some
one
else
did
not
greatly
matter
i
am
very
glad
it
was
you
and
not
another
who
found
him
and
of
course
i
am
not
sorry
that
such
should
have
been
the
case
miss
baynard
had
resumed
her
chair
and
dare
had
dropped
into
another
no
great
distance
away
if
there
is
no
secret
involved
in
the
affair
and
it
will
be
breaking
no
confidence
on
your
part
i
should
like
you
to
tell
me
not
only
how
you
succeeded
in
discovering
evan
whereabouts
but
by
what
means
you
contrived
to
rescue
him
from
the
wretches
for
wretches
they
must
have
been
who
to
gratify
some
vile
purpose
of
their
own
stole
him
away
in
broad
daylight
is
a
story
very
easily
told
to
your
old
friend
captain
nightshade
is
due
the
boy
rescue
from
those
who
abducted
him
to
captain
nightshade
oh
who
once
more
and
for
the
last
time
revisited
the
glimpses
of
the
moon
but
i
am
starting
my
story
at
the
wrong
end
i
will
tell
it
you
from
the
beginning
since
you
say
you
would
like
to
hear
it
first
of
all
however
i
must
inquire
into
the
state
of
master
evan
horse
which
seems
to
be
minus
one
of
its
legs
miss
baynard
left
rockmount
two
hours
later
but
without
seeing
ellerslie
again
who
sent
his
apologies
by
his
nephew
his
rheumatism
had
come
on
in
the
night
and
this
morning
he
was
unable
to
rise
dare
rode
with
miss
baynard
as
far
as
the
park
gates
of
stanbrook
with
evan
in
front
of
him
next
day
he
was
going
to
london
there
to
complete
a
few
preparations
and
arrange
certain
business
matters
for
ellerslie
before
setting
sail
for
that
new
world
where
his
home
would
henceforth
be
but
this
was
not
to
be
their
final
farewell
they
would
see
each
other
once
more
in
about
a
fortnight
when
dare
would
come
north
in
order
to
bid
his
uncle
goodbye
on
which
occasion
he
would
not
fail
to
call
at
stanbrook
he
would
not
of
course
dream
of
leaving
england
without
seeing
his
godson
again
and
so
they
parted
both
secretly
consumed
with
love
dare
would
not
open
his
lips
in
the
first
place
he
was
far
too
poor
to
marry
and
then
to
dream
that
in
any
case
the
proud
and
beautiful
miss
baynard
would
stoop
so
low
as
to
wed
the
notorious
captain
nightshade
was
the
veriest
moonstruck
folly
had
he
but
known
how
often
nell
with
despair
gnawing
at
her
heartstrings
murmured
sadly
to
herself
if
only
he
would
say
one
word
what
a
change
little
less
than
miraculous
would
have
come
over
him
but
the
word
was
not
said
and
they
separated
with
nothing
warmer
than
a
torn
asunder
not
by
fate
but
by
their
own
pride
and
to
the
full
as
wretched
as
parted
lovers
are
always
said
or
supposed
to
be
lady
carradine
having
much
leisure
time
on
her
hands
and
being
fond
of
not
infrequently
obliged
her
goddaughter
with
one
of
her
lengthy
and
somewhat
epistles
to
miss
baynard
in
the
retirement
of
stanbrook
these
occasional
glimpses
of
a
life
so
different
from
her
own
were
always
welcome
and
as
her
ladyship
had
now
taken
up
her
permanent
residence
in
london
and
saw
a
good
deal
of
company
she
had
much
to
tell
that
was
both
fresh
and
interesting
nearly
a
fortnight
had
gone
by
since
nell
return
from
rockmount
and
she
was
looking
daily
for
the
coming
of
dare
when
one
of
lady
carradine
crossed
and
recrossed
letters
postage
in
those
days
was
a
consideration
came
to
hand
with
only
one
part
of
her
epistle
are
we
in
any
way
concerned
the
part
in
question
ran
as
under
i
forget
my
dear
whether
i
ever
mentioned
to
you
that
among
my
many
acquaintances
is
numbered
sir
peter
warrendale
a
baronet
of
old
family
whose
home
when
he
is
at
home
is
somewhere
in
your
benighted
part
of
the
country
of
late
years
however
he
has
been
seen
a
good
deal
in
town
i
have
a
notion
that
his
health
is
not
quite
what
he
would
like
it
to
be
and
that
he
has
little
or
no
faith
in
your
rural
practitioners
which
i
ca
wonder
at
but
that
is
his
own
secret
he
is
now
well
on
for
seventy
a
tetchy
old
man
with
a
good
word
for
nobody
behind
their
back
and
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
he
pulls
me
to
pieces
before
others
just
as
he
pulls
others
to
pieces
before
me
i
candidly
confess
that
i
do
like
him
but
he
helps
to
amuse
me
and
to
any
one
who
does
that
i
can
forgive
much
i
had
not
seen
him
for
some
little
time
till
one
evening
about
a
week
ago
when
he
called
upon
me
evidently
brimful
of
news
of
which
it
was
needful
that
he
should
relieve
himself
to
somebody
if
he
wished
to
escape
a
fit
of
apoplexy
i
quite
expected
that
i
was
about
to
be
treated
to
the
latest
scandalous
or
the
most
recent
morsel
of
society
gossip
which
would
lose
nothing
in
sir
peter
telling
but
for
once
i
was
mistaken
what
he
had
to
tell
me
was
the
particulars
of
a
somewhat
singular
incident
in
which
he
had
figured
as
one
of
the
chief
actors
it
would
appear
that
several
months
ago
sir
peter
while
travelling
in
his
own
chariot
was
stopped
by
a
mounted
highwayman
and
relieved
among
other
things
of
a
choice
an
heirloom
and
set
with
brilliants
by
which
he
set
great
store
although
the
affair
happened
in
his
own
part
of
the
country
when
he
came
to
town
a
few
weeks
later
he
reported
his
loss
at
bow
street
and
handed
in
a
full
description
of
the
box
this
he
did
in
the
faint
hope
that
the
box
might
some
day
find
its
way
to
one
of
the
london
pawnbrokers
to
each
of
whom
a
description
of
it
would
have
been
furnished
and
through
him
back
to
its
rightful
owner
time
went
on
and
sir
peter
had
given
up
all
hope
of
ever
seeing
his
box
again
when
he
was
one
day
requested
to
betake
himself
to
bow
street
and
there
sure
enough
he
set
eyes
once
more
on
his
precious
heirloom
it
had
been
found
on
the
person
of
a
low
london
thief
who
had
been
arrested
for
something
altogether
different
but
now
comes
the
most
singular
feature
of
the
affair
the
box
had
been
stolen
once
several
months
ago
from
the
person
of
sir
peter
and
a
second
time
a
few
weeks
ago
here
in
london
from
the
person
of
a
certain
geoffrey
dare
and
both
losses
had
been
notified
to
the
authorities
sir
peter
having
identified
the
box
as
his
property
it
became
needful
to
ascertain
through
what
channel
it
had
come
into
the
possession
of
dare
who
seems
to
be
one
of
those
numerous
young
men
of
good
family
about
whom
one
is
continually
hearing
who
seem
to
think
that
twenty
thousand
pounds
will
go
as
far
as
a
hundred
thousand
and
who
after
their
follies
and
extravagances
have
made
them
the
talk
of
the
town
for
a
few
seasons
vanish
and
are
no
more
seen
at
any
rate
that
some
two
or
three
years
ago
the
young
man
in
question
was
a
figure
in
london
society
and
that
with
the
help
of
the
gaming
table
an
important
factor
in
nearly
all
such
cases
he
dissipated
his
fortune
to
the
last
shilling
are
well
ascertained
facts
when
inquired
for
at
his
lodgings
a
couple
of
cheap
rooms
in
some
horrid
back
street
it
was
ascertained
that
he
had
gone
into
the
country
for
an
indefinite
time
without
leaving
any
word
where
he
might
be
found
such
being
the
state
of
affairs
nothing
more
could
be
done
till
he
should
return
which
he
did
about
ten
days
ago
a
message
had
been
left
at
his
lodgings
requesting
his
attendance
at
bow
street
which
he
seems
to
have
lost
no
time
in
obeying
there
he
was
questioned
as
to
how
the
came
into
his
keeping
and
his
answers
not
being
deemed
satisfactory
he
was
confronted
with
sir
peter
in
him
although
he
admitted
that
the
highwayman
was
masked
the
baronet
professed
to
recognize
the
man
who
robbed
him
of
his
purse
and
the
box
indeed
on
being
pressed
he
actually
went
so
far
as
to
swear
to
his
identity
with
the
robber
although
from
what
he
has
confessed
to
me
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
the
evidence
on
which
he
grounds
his
accusation
is
of
the
flimsiest
possible
kind
but
be
that
as
it
may
after
two
or
three
remands
at
bow
street
dare
has
been
committed
to
take
his
trial
for
highway
robbery
at
the
next
lanchester
assizes
within
a
few
miles
of
which
town
sir
peter
was
waylaid
i
had
written
thus
far
yesterday
when
sir
peter
himself
rang
the
bell
he
brought
me
some
further
news
with
regard
to
young
dare
which
is
of
a
sufficiently
remarkable
kind
it
would
appear
that
the
authorities
have
some
ground
for
believing
that
in
him
they
have
laid
hands
on
no
less
a
personage
than
a
certain
captain
nightshade
a
sobriquet
of
course
whose
exploits
and
adventures
as
a
gentleman
of
the
road
in
the
course
of
the
past
two
or
three
years
have
according
to
sir
peter
formed
the
fireside
talk
of
half
the
households
in
the
north
of
england
it
seems
however
that
some
six
or
eight
months
ago
he
disappeared
and
has
not
been
heard
of
since
but
now
that
the
runners
have
been
laid
on
the
scent
not
be
their
fault
if
they
fail
to
run
their
quarry
to
earth
poor
fellow
i
ca
help
feeling
sorry
for
him
although
it
may
be
very
reprehensible
on
my
part
to
say
so
i
am
afraid
it
will
go
hard
with
him
at
his
trial
is
said
that
captain
nightshade
was
one
of
the
most
chivalrous
of
men
and
never
robbed
a
woman
in
his
life
chapter
xxv
a
desperate
resolve
lady
carradine
letter
figuratively
speaking
smote
poor
nell
like
a
bolt
from
the
blue
she
had
imagined
several
things
any
one
of
which
might
have
delayed
dare
coming
he
had
given
her
to
understand
that
his
business
in
london
would
not
take
up
more
than
a
fortnight
at
the
most
but
no
faintest
dread
or
suspicion
that
after
so
long
a
time
he
would
be
arrested
and
cast
for
trial
on
a
charge
connected
with
his
past
career
had
ever
entered
her
mind
it
was
like
a
stab
in
the
dark
by
an
unseen
hand
and
she
reeled
under
it
and
felt
for
a
while
as
if
she
were
hurt
in
a
vital
part
past
hope
of
recovery
she
did
not
sleep
a
wink
during
the
whole
of
the
night
after
her
receipt
of
the
news
now
and
then
she
lay
down
for
a
little
while
on
a
couch
but
for
the
most
part
she
spent
the
long
dark
hours
in
pacing
her
room
restlessly
from
end
to
end
no
sooner
however
had
the
first
streak
of
daylight
appeared
in
the
sky
than
she
quitted
the
house
and
making
her
way
down
to
the
banks
of
the
little
river
which
ran
past
the
foot
of
the
park
she
followed
its
solitary
windings
for
some
miles
till
it
drew
near
the
village
of
mosscrags
where
the
early
housewives
were
now
astir
and
the
laborers
going
forth
to
their
work
then
she
turned
and
retraced
the
way
she
had
come
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
think
more
clearly
and
coherently
under
the
free
air
of
heaven
than
in
the
confined
space
of
her
own
chamber
all
her
thinking
had
for
its
intent
the
answering
of
one
question
what
can
i
do
to
help
him
but
so
bitterly
did
the
sense
of
her
powerlessness
weigh
upon
her
that
she
could
have
beaten
her
head
against
the
wall
in
a
tempest
of
rage
and
impotent
passion
she
could
do
nothing
nothing
a
babe
would
be
as
competent
to
help
him
as
she
was
the
four
walls
of
a
jail
held
him
and
there
was
no
door
of
escape
open
to
him
save
that
last
one
of
all
which
led
to
the
gallows
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
night
the
shadows
that
seem
to
lurk
so
thickly
around
one
at
such
times
had
shaped
themselves
into
the
ghastly
semblance
of
a
with
its
dangling
rope
which
all
imaginary
though
it
was
had
caused
her
soul
to
shudder
and
grow
sick
within
her
in
the
days
to
which
our
narrative
refers
the
old
barbarous
and
inhuman
penal
code
was
still
in
full
operation
and
crimes
which
a
short
term
of
imprisonment
with
hard
labor
would
now
expiate
had
the
last
dread
sentence
of
the
law
pronounced
on
them
without
hope
of
reprieve
at
the
lanchester
spring
assizes
of
that
year
as
miss
baynard
did
not
fail
to
call
to
mind
a
couple
of
men
had
been
condemned
to
death
one
of
them
for
and
the
other
for
in
the
eye
of
the
law
the
crime
for
which
geoffrey
dare
stood
committed
was
of
a
much
more
heinous
kind
than
either
of
those
and
should
the
charge
be
proved
against
him
as
there
seemed
every
likelihood
of
its
being
then
would
the
gallows
seen
by
nell
with
the
eyes
of
her
imagination
develop
into
a
very
real
erection
on
the
roof
of
lanchester
jail
in
such
a
case
as
dare
whether
or
no
they
succeeded
in
identifying
him
with
captain
nightshade
the
death
penalty
would
indubitably
be
exacted
justice
would
demand
her
victim
while
mercy
wept
with
her
face
turned
to
the
wall
and
still
nell
heart
echoed
persistently
with
the
cry
what
can
i
do
to
help
him
but
it
was
a
cry
which
both
earth
and
heaven
flung
back
and
to
which
no
answer
was
vouchsafed
her
all
that
day
and
all
the
next
night
she
was
like
a
distracted
creature
but
distracted
after
the
quiet
fashion
of
one
who
craves
for
absolute
solitude
and
to
whom
even
the
society
of
those
nearest
and
dearest
is
distasteful
if
not
positively
unbearable
budd
was
greatly
put
about
being
altogether
at
a
loss
to
divine
what
was
the
matter
with
nell
and
whether
the
strangeness
of
her
manner
was
due
to
a
mental
or
bodily
cause
never
before
had
she
developed
such
peculiar
symptoms
for
no
more
sane
and
healthy
being
ever
existed
she
had
never
swooned
in
her
life
although
swooning
at
proper
times
and
season
was
regarded
rather
as
a
fashionable
accomplishment
than
otherwise
she
never
fancied
that
she
was
ill
when
nothing
ailed
her
or
pretended
that
she
had
lost
her
appetite
she
was
never
troubled
with
qualms
or
spasms
or
the
vertigo
and
as
for
being
dyspeptic
she
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
she
had
been
rendered
very
anxious
and
unhappy
by
the
abduction
of
evan
and
proportionately
happy
by
his
recovery
but
there
had
been
nothing
in
the
way
she
bore
herself
at
that
time
which
at
all
resembled
the
peculiar
and
inexplicable
mood
of
which
she
had
been
the
victim
for
the
last
hours
it
was
in
a
certain
measure
due
to
budd
instinctive
tact
which
taught
her
when
it
was
advisable
to
speak
and
when
to
keep
silent
that
she
and
miss
baynard
had
got
on
so
well
together
on
the
present
occasion
her
instinct
told
her
that
nell
was
in
no
mood
to
bear
questioning
and
she
kept
a
guard
on
her
tongue
accordingly
but
by
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
her
uneasiness
had
grown
to
such
an
extent
that
she
felt
she
should
be
lacking
in
her
duty
to
one
so
much
younger
than
herself
if
she
refrained
any
longer
from
endeavoring
to
discover
what
it
was
that
had
changed
miss
baynard
so
unaccountably
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
my
dear
elinor
what
is
it
that
ails
you
whatever
is
the
matter
with
you
she
at
length
summoned
up
courage
to
ask
you
are
not
like
the
same
girl
that
you
were
at
yesterday
am
i
not
and
yet
i
am
the
same
replied
nell
with
a
smile
which
had
more
of
tears
than
mirth
in
it
what
that
ails
me
do
you
ask
nothing
more
serious
than
a
fit
of
the
megrims
i
assure
you
but
i
am
apt
to
be
dangerous
at
such
times
you
had
better
not
come
too
near
me
i
might
grow
worse
and
bite
you
then
before
the
astonished
lady
had
time
to
collect
her
faculties
she
found
herself
hugged
and
kissed
and
left
alone
half
a
minute
later
she
heard
miss
baynard
singing
as
she
went
upstairs
to
her
room
then
a
door
clashed
somewhere
in
the
distance
and
all
was
still
some
time
in
the
dead
of
night
nell
lay
down
on
the
couch
in
her
bedroom
and
presently
sank
into
the
deep
sleep
of
utter
exhaustion
in
that
sleep
she
had
a
very
vivid
dream
from
which
at
the
end
of
a
couple
of
hours
she
suddenly
awoke
so
strongly
had
the
particulars
of
her
dream
impressed
themselves
upon
her
that
she
lay
for
another
hour
without
stirring
turning
them
over
and
over
in
her
mind
till
she
had
mastered
every
detail
of
the
scheme
which
as
she
firmly
believed
had
been
revealed
to
her
by
some
supernatural
influence
in
her
sleep
she
had
scarcely
eaten
a
mouthful
of
anything
since
her
receipt
of
her
godmother
letter
but
this
morning
she
appeared
at
the
as
usual
and
looking
as
if
the
last
two
days
had
been
blotted
out
of
her
existence
she
was
still
a
little
pale
and
dark
round
the
eyes
but
the
eyes
themselves
had
lost
that
look
of
almost
fierce
despair
as
of
a
creature
driven
to
bay
and
not
knowing
which
way
to
turn
which
had
been
their
dominant
expression
for
the
last
hours
now
they
shone
with
a
serene
and
steadfast
lustre
which
yet
had
in
it
a
something
of
fixed
resolution
as
if
bent
on
carrying
out
some
hidden
purpose
which
the
busy
brain
behind
was
brooding
remotely
over
even
while
its
outward
attention
was
occupied
and
given
with
seeming
abandonment
to
far
other
things
budd
saw
and
was
satisfied
and
was
far
too
wise
to
put
any
further
questions
with
reference
to
a
state
of
affairs
which
was
so
evidently
over
and
done
with
nell
followed
budd
lead
over
wherever
that
good
lady
chose
to
let
it
wander
and
her
divagations
were
many
and
various
she
seemed
in
the
best
of
spirits
and
when
the
meal
was
over
she
indulged
herself
and
evan
with
a
wild
romp
the
boy
had
been
much
put
about
in
his
childish
way
because
for
the
last
two
nights
he
had
been
banished
from
his
aunt
nell
chamber
to
that
of
budd
in
those
first
days
after
his
recovery
nell
would
not
entrust
him
at
night
to
the
care
of
any
of
the
servants
but
this
glorious
romp
made
amends
for
everything
after
that
nell
disappeared
for
some
hours
and
was
engaged
upstairs
in
her
own
rooms
but
she
joined
budd
and
evan
at
dinner
and
in
the
afternoon
they
all
drove
out
together
and
watched
the
sunset
from
the
summit
of
goat
scar
then
followed
a
long
and
happy
evening
never
had
budd
seen
the
girl
more
seemingly
merry
and
than
she
was
that
day
she
and
the
nell
of
the
day
before
were
two
different
beings
and
yet
at
times
there
would
come
a
pause
in
her
gayety
and
for
a
few
seconds
the
light
in
her
eyes
would
deepen
and
darken
and
a
look
would
come
into
them
as
if
something
had
suddenly
crossed
her
vision
seen
by
herself
alone
but
whatever
it
might
be
it
went
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
and
with
one
breath
she
was
herself
again
next
day
at
breakfast
her
mood
was
unaltered
but
again
in
the
course
of
the
forenoon
she
was
invisible
for
a
couple
of
hours
that
there
was
some
secret
business
afoot
budd
felt
satisfied
but
being
the
most
discreet
of
matrons
she
would
rather
have
tied
a
handkerchief
over
her
eyes
than
have
allowed
them
to
see
what
it
was
evidently
not
intended
they
should
see
still
it
was
not
without
a
little
shock
of
surprise
that
she
heard
the
news
which
nell
broke
abruptly
to
her
as
soon
as
their
two
dinner
had
come
to
an
end
i
am
about
to
leave
you
for
a
little
while
said
the
girl
smiling
bravely
at
present
i
can
tell
you
neither
the
object
of
my
journey
nor
my
destination
but
that
you
will
know
everything
in
good
time
i
do
not
doubt
neither
can
i
fix
the
date
of
my
return
because
that
is
a
point
about
which
i
am
not
quite
clear
i
leave
evan
in
your
hands
with
every
confidence
that
you
will
look
well
after
him
i
feel
assured
he
loves
you
and
will
be
happy
with
you
after
this
followed
a
few
directions
with
regard
to
household
and
other
matters
then
miss
baynard
went
to
get
ready
for
her
journey
an
hour
later
budd
and
evan
were
waiting
on
the
steps
of
the
main
entrance
to
see
her
start
presently
mounted
on
her
mare
peggy
and
followed
by
john
dyce
also
on
horseback
she
came
riding
round
from
the
stables
and
a
very
fair
and
gracious
picture
she
made
in
her
long
riding
habit
over
which
she
wore
a
short
gray
cloak
lined
with
black
and
tied
with
black
ribbons
being
in
mourning
for
cortelyon
her
hat
was
of
black
beaver
and
ornamented
with
two
sweeping
ostrich
plumes
of
the
same
color
the
afternoon
sun
shining
upon
three
or
four
heavy
ringlets
of
chestnut
hair
which
had
escaped
from
under
her
hat
made
a
golden
glory
of
them
the
late
pallor
of
her
complexion
had
given
place
to
a
lovely
flush
of
color
her
eyes
while
more
than
ordinarily
brilliant
did
not
smile
as
her
lips
did
rather
did
it
seem
as
if
they
were
charged
with
the
light
of
some
great
resolution
which
might
need
all
her
courage
to
carry
it
through
evan
was
held
aloft
for
the
sake
of
a
last
kiss
there
was
a
fervent
heaven
keep
you
darling
a
flickering
smile
the
glisten
of
a
tear
a
last
wave
of
the
hand
and
nell
was
gone
the
widow
and
child
stood
hand
in
hand
till
the
trees
of
the
avenue
hid
her
from
view
and
the
sound
of
had
died
into
silence
then
they
went
back
indoors
but
for
both
the
light
and
gladness
of
the
house
had
vanished
there
was
a
chill
upon
everything
their
spirits
included
an
good
riding
brought
miss
baynard
and
her
escort
to
the
quaint
old
town
of
lanchester
with
its
narrow
streets
and
narrower
alleyways
with
its
many
overhanging
lopsided
houses
and
its
grim
old
county
jail
built
of
ragged
graystone
which
frowns
blankly
down
from
the
upper
end
of
its
wide
as
if
in
mute
warning
to
all
and
sundry
miss
baynard
whose
road
led
her
past
one
corner
of
it
shuddered
involuntarily
as
she
glanced
at
it
out
of
a
corner
of
her
eye
for
her
just
then
that
gray
old
pile
was
the
most
vitally
interesting
spot
in
the
whole
world
she
was
bound
first
of
all
for
langrig
the
seat
of
sir
james
dalrymple
which
was
situated
in
the
suburbs
of
lanchester
sir
james
it
may
be
remembered
was
one
of
the
trustees
appointed
under
cortelyon
unsigned
will
and
very
glad
he
was
when
he
came
to
learn
the
contents
of
that
document
to
find
that
it
was
so
much
waste
paper
and
that
he
would
not
be
called
upon
to
help
in
the
carrying
out
of
what
he
regarded
as
its
most
wicked
and
unjust
provisions
he
had
a
warm
regard
for
nell
not
only
for
her
own
sake
but
for
that
of
her
father
whom
he
had
known
and
liked
and
with
whom
he
had
spent
many
a
roystering
evening
when
they
were
young
blades
together
about
london
town
finally
it
may
be
mentioned
that
sir
james
was
chairman
of
the
lanchester
bench
of
magistrates
i
have
come
to
you
sir
james
on
rather
a
singular
errand
began
miss
baynard
when
she
had
been
shown
into
the
library
where
she
found
the
baronet
sitting
with
one
leg
in
a
and
after
the
usual
greetings
had
passed
between
them
my
dear
young
lady
my
humble
services
are
at
your
command
in
any
and
every
way
at
the
present
time
there
is
a
certain
prisoner
geoffrey
dare
by
name
in
lanchester
jail
awaiting
his
trial
at
the
next
assizes
which
open
in
three
weeks
from
now
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
the
rascal
who
is
said
to
have
waylaid
sir
peter
warrendale
and
robbed
him
of
his
watch
and
and
who
is
shrewdly
suspected
of
being
none
other
than
the
notorious
captain
nightshade
but
what
about
him
merely
this
sir
james
that
i
want
you
to
give
me
an
order
of
admission
i
know
you
have
ample
power
to
do
so
to
see
him
privately
in
prison
when
i
say
privately
in
prison
i
of
course
mean
without
witnesses
sir
james
gave
vent
to
a
low
whistle
my
dear
miss
baynard
do
you
know
that
this
is
really
a
somewhat
extraordinary
request
of
yours
i
am
quite
aware
of
it
but
let
me
explain
why
i
have
preferred
it
she
drew
a
long
breath
without
she
was
prepared
to
tell
a
lie
nay
more
than
one
she
felt
sure
that
her
request
would
run
the
risk
of
a
refusal
lies
to
her
had
ever
been
an
abomination
but
the
aim
she
had
set
before
herself
was
such
as
to
leave
her
no
option
in
the
matter
when
a
man
life
is
at
stake
and
that
the
life
of
the
person
you
love
best
in
the
world
the
ordinary
rules
of
conduct
are
apt
to
get
mixed
and
blurred
and
much
may
be
forgiven
in
such
extreme
cases
black
is
liable
to
be
regarded
as
white
and
white
as
any
color
you
please
miss
baynard
had
come
prepared
to
answer
objections
and
she
went
on
after
a
hardly
observable
pause
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
sir
james
that
dare
in
his
more
prosperous
days
was
the
bosom
friend
of
my
late
cousin
dick
cortelyon
whose
young
son
as
you
are
aware
has
just
inherited
his
grandfather
property
well
it
so
happens
that
a
couple
of
days
ago
in
turning
over
some
letters
and
other
effects
which
had
belonged
to
my
cousin
i
came
across
a
sort
of
rough
diary
which
had
been
kept
by
him
during
the
last
year
of
his
life
in
it
there
is
a
passage
in
which
he
makes
mention
of
a
batch
of
rather
important
family
papers
which
after
he
had
fallen
into
disgrace
at
home
he
had
entrusted
to
the
keeping
of
dare
now
although
i
have
sought
for
them
high
and
low
i
have
failed
to
find
any
trace
of
the
papers
in
question
and
am
consequently
most
anxious
to
ascertain
from
dare
what
has
become
of
them
indeed
i
think
it
most
likely
that
they
are
still
somewhere
in
his
keeping
such
is
my
reason
sir
james
for
desiring
an
interview
with
him
if
it
could
be
arranged
for
i
should
esteem
it
a
great
favor
as
some
very
special
business
will
take
me
from
home
and
the
date
of
my
return
is
altogether
uncertain
my
dear
miss
baynard
not
a
word
more
is
needed
i
will
at
once
write
and
give
you
a
note
addressed
to
captain
jeffs
the
governor
of
the
jail
authorizing
him
to
permit
you
to
have
a
private
interview
with
the
prisoner
dare
what
a
pity
what
a
damnable
pity
it
is
begging
your
pardon
that
a
young
fellow
with
good
family
and
with
the
brilliant
prospects
which
i
am
given
to
understand
were
once
his
should
have
brought
his
kettle
of
fish
to
such
a
market
as
he
seems
to
have
done
but
as
we
make
our
bed
so
must
we
lie
on
it
and
now
but
dear
me
dear
me
here
am
i
running
on
without
ever
thinking
to
ask
you
what
you
will
take
in
the
way
of
refreshment
that
one
of
the
fruits
of
being
an
old
bachelor
and
of
having
no
womenfolk
to
keep
me
up
to
the
mark
and
teach
me
not
to
forget
the
minor
courtesies
of
life
in
the
result
nell
agreed
to
accept
a
glass
of
the
particular
old
madeira
and
a
biscuit
not
to
have
done
as
much
as
that
would
have
been
to
infringe
the
unwritten
laws
of
hospitality
then
said
sir
james
i
had
lawyer
piljoy
here
day
his
purpose
in
coming
was
to
tell
me
all
about
the
lost
child
and
its
recovery
and
a
most
amazing
story
it
is
and
further
to
consult
with
me
as
to
what
steps
if
any
it
is
advisable
to
take
in
the
affair
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
send
for
staniforth
who
was
to
have
been
your
uncle
other
trustee
and
then
we
three
laid
our
heads
together
i
need
not
bother
you
with
reciting
any
of
our
arguments
pro
and
con
but
in
the
end
we
agreed
that
it
would
not
for
various
reasons
be
advisable
that
any
further
proceedings
should
be
taken
in
the
matter
the
child
has
been
restored
which
is
the
main
thing
to
be
borne
in
mind
and
we
felt
pretty
sure
that
no
attempt
would
be
made
to
abduct
him
a
second
time
you
say
sir
james
that
the
child
has
been
restored
which
is
quite
true
but
do
you
know
whom
we
have
to
thank
for
it
have
the
remotest
notion
i
asked
piljoy
how
it
came
about
but
he
could
tell
me
he
said
that
if
anybody
knew
you
did
but
that
beyond
telling
him
it
was
the
honorable
who
had
abducted
the
youngster
what
a
that
woman
must
be
you
had
favored
him
with
no
particulars
it
is
to
geoffrey
dare
now
a
prisoner
in
lanchester
jail
that
the
child
recovery
is
due
it
had
been
arranged
that
he
the
boy
should
be
secretly
transported
to
america
where
we
should
never
have
heard
of
him
more
when
dare
having
discovered
what
was
afoot
in
the
guise
of
a
highwayman
stopped
the
carriage
in
which
he
was
being
carried
off
and
rescued
him
from
the
wretches
to
whose
charge
he
had
been
committed
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
my
life
damme
if
i
did
um
um
i
crave
your
pardon
my
dear
but
strong
feelings
have
a
way
of
finding
their
vent
in
strong
language
and
young
dare
did
that
did
he
well
well
we
must
see
what
can
be
done
for
him
when
his
trial
comes
on
such
stuff
as
he
seems
made
of
is
too
good
for
the
gallows
and
now
i
will
write
you
the
promised
note
i
afraid
you
be
a
little
later
than
the
regulation
hour
for
seeing
prisoners
but
maybe
jeffs
will
strain
a
point
for
once
in
a
way
at
any
rate
i
ask
him
to
do
so
chapter
xxvi
for
my
sake
the
late
september
afternoon
was
closing
rapidly
in
when
john
dyce
helped
his
mistress
to
alight
from
her
mare
which
had
been
reined
up
close
to
the
great
black
gates
of
lanchester
jail
it
was
a
rare
thing
for
those
gates
to
be
opened
except
for
the
admission
of
prisoners
the
usual
means
of
entrance
and
exit
being
by
a
postern
in
the
wall
no
great
distance
away
on
this
door
miss
baynard
now
proceeded
to
give
three
resounding
blows
with
the
huge
iron
knocker
half
a
minute
later
a
small
wicket
was
opened
and
a
hirsute
face
peered
out
into
the
glowing
darkness
be
good
enough
to
have
this
note
given
to
captain
jeffs
without
a
minute
delay
said
miss
baynard
in
her
clear
imperious
tones
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
i
will
wait
here
while
you
obtain
an
answer
with
that
she
handed
in
sir
james
note
at
the
wicket
but
on
the
top
of
it
lay
a
shining
guinea
there
was
a
grunt
and
the
wicket
was
shut
while
awaiting
an
answer
nell
drew
from
one
of
her
pockets
a
long
diaphanous
black
veil
which
she
proceeded
to
fix
round
the
brim
of
her
hat
and
to
fasten
in
a
knot
behind
in
such
a
fashion
that
it
came
halfway
down
her
face
leaving
nothing
of
it
exposed
save
her
upper
lip
her
mouth
and
her
chin
the
wait
seemed
an
intolerably
long
one
and
her
nerve
was
beginning
to
give
way
a
little
when
the
wicket
was
opened
for
the
second
time
and
the
same
hirsute
face
made
its
appearance
the
governor
says
beyont
the
hour
for
visitors
and
that
ye
should
have
come
earlier
but
as
ye
a
friend
o
sir
james
dalrymple
he
admit
ye
he
sends
word
that
he
sorry
not
to
come
and
speak
to
ye
hisself
but
he
got
company
at
dinner
and
ca
leave
th
table
such
in
the
gruffest
of
tones
was
the
doorkeeper
welcome
message
then
the
wicket
was
closed
again
and
half
a
minute
later
the
narrow
black
door
had
opened
to
admit
nell
she
slipped
in
like
a
shadow
the
postern
was
shut
with
a
clash
and
she
found
herself
in
a
bare
flagged
or
with
three
or
four
doors
opening
out
of
it
and
dimly
lighted
with
a
couple
of
guttering
candles
here
was
a
second
man
like
the
first
in
uniform
who
carried
in
one
hand
a
jingling
bunch
of
keys
and
to
whom
the
doorkeeper
introduced
her
with
the
remark
this
is
willyam
mum
who
will
show
ye
the
way
if
ye
will
please
to
follow
him
then
perhaps
william
will
oblige
me
by
accepting
this
trifle
said
miss
baynard
and
before
the
turnkey
knew
what
had
happened
there
was
a
guinea
nestling
in
his
palm
then
from
some
mysterious
pocket
miss
baynard
produced
a
large
flat
bottle
containing
a
quart
of
the
most
potent
brandy
in
the
stanbrook
cellars
and
here
is
something
to
share
between
you
and
to
drink
my
health
in
she
added
as
she
proffered
the
bottle
for
the
doorkeeper
acceptance
who
took
it
as
tenderly
as
if
it
had
been
a
baby
eh
mum
but
it
agen
the
rules
to
accept
anything
o
this
sort
he
remarked
with
a
wag
of
his
head
we
not
engage
to
drink
it
no
no
rules
is
made
in
order
that
they
may
be
broke
we
just
hide
it
away
where
nobody
but
ourselves
can
find
it
so
as
not
to
put
temptation
in
the
way
of
any
other
poor
body
and
with
that
the
rascal
favored
his
with
a
portentous
wink
the
latter
functionary
now
lighted
a
small
lantern
and
having
unlocked
one
of
the
inner
doors
he
said
if
you
will
be
pleased
to
follow
me
mum
by
this
time
nell
nerves
were
worked
up
to
a
point
of
tension
that
was
almost
unendurable
she
set
her
teeth
hard
and
clenched
her
hands
as
if
she
intended
never
to
open
them
again
success
had
attended
her
so
far
would
it
desert
her
now
what
she
had
already
achieved
was
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
that
which
was
still
before
her
for
a
few
moments
it
seemed
as
if
the
courage
which
had
hitherto
sustained
her
were
about
to
give
way
as
she
followed
the
man
she
had
merely
a
vague
impression
of
a
gloomy
flagged
corridor
lighted
only
by
the
lantern
of
a
heavy
iron
door
which
had
to
be
unlocked
to
allow
of
their
further
advance
of
another
corridor
the
counterpart
of
the
first
save
that
on
one
side
of
it
some
doors
were
ranged
at
intervals
at
one
of
these
her
conductor
came
to
a
halt
and
having
selected
a
key
from
his
bunch
proceeded
to
unlock
it
then
flinging
wide
the
door
he
said
in
deep
gruff
tones
which
seemed
to
fill
the
corridor
prisoner
a
lady
to
see
you
and
with
that
he
moved
aside
to
allow
miss
baynard
to
enter
at
the
words
dare
sprang
to
his
feet
he
had
been
reading
stretched
at
full
length
on
the
pallet
which
served
him
for
a
bed
by
night
and
a
couch
by
day
a
wooden
sconce
fixed
against
the
wall
held
a
solitary
candle
of
the
coarsest
tallow
which
diffused
a
dim
sickly
light
through
the
cell
it
was
an
indulgence
his
own
pocket
had
to
pay
for
had
not
the
volume
on
which
he
was
engaged
been
in
large
print
he
could
not
have
seen
to
read
it
at
sight
of
him
all
nell
failing
courage
came
back
to
her
with
a
rush
mingled
with
a
great
wave
of
love
and
compassion
hardly
could
she
command
her
voice
while
she
whispered
to
the
turnkey
leave
us
for
do
come
before
all
right
mum
whispered
the
man
back
then
nell
stepped
across
the
threshold
of
the
cell
and
the
door
was
locked
behind
her
dare
his
book
fallen
unheeded
to
the
floor
stood
staring
at
her
with
eyes
as
though
she
were
some
visitant
from
the
tomb
nell
responded
to
his
amazement
with
a
smile
and
eyes
that
no
longer
strove
to
hide
a
secret
which
she
flattered
herself
they
had
never
revealed
before
she
could
not
have
spoken
at
that
moment
to
save
her
life
she
felt
as
if
a
spell
were
upon
her
everything
about
her
was
unreal
dare
himself
was
not
a
creature
of
flesh
and
blood
but
merely
a
projection
of
her
own
imagination
some
sorceress
had
thrown
an
enchantment
over
her
which
is
it
you
miss
baynard
whom
i
see
and
here
of
all
places
in
the
universe
dare
voice
broke
the
spell
that
was
upon
her
and
recalled
to
her
as
in
a
flash
the
very
real
business
the
matter
of
life
and
death
which
had
taken
her
there
and
which
must
be
entered
on
without
a
minute
unnecessary
delay
yes
it
is
i
dare
she
answered
in
accents
that
were
slightly
tremulous
you
did
me
and
mine
a
great
nay
an
inestimable
service
and
i
am
here
to
see
whether
i
can
not
do
something
for
you
in
return
a
bitter
smile
lit
up
his
sallow
features
for
a
moment
it
is
indeed
good
of
you
to
have
put
yourself
to
so
much
trouble
about
such
a
worthless
wretch
as
i
but
were
i
a
more
worthy
than
i
am
neither
you
miss
baynard
nor
any
power
on
earth
save
and
except
the
king
clemency
which
is
altogether
out
of
the
question
could
do
aught
to
help
me
out
of
the
coil
of
trouble
which
i
have
brought
upon
myself
do
not
be
too
sure
on
that
point
dare
it
is
the
humblest
instruments
which
sometimes
avail
for
the
most
difficult
tasks
we
have
all
read
the
fable
of
the
lion
and
the
mouse
and
cases
might
arise
in
which
even
such
an
inconsiderable
person
as
i
owing
to
my
very
insignificance
might
be
able
to
do
things
which
would
be
impossible
in
any
one
of
greater
importance
her
voice
was
firm
enough
by
now
and
her
eyes
confronted
his
unwaveringly
she
had
pushed
up
her
veil
till
only
an
edge
of
it
was
visible
across
her
forehead
at
the
moment
the
turnkey
had
locked
the
door
behind
her
dare
bowed
but
looked
slightly
puzzled
to
what
was
all
this
the
prelude
that
she
had
not
come
there
without
having
some
very
special
purpose
in
view
he
could
no
longer
doubt
but
merely
to
see
her
face
again
was
to
him
what
the
sight
of
water
is
to
some
poor
wretch
dying
of
thirst
in
the
desert
to
himself
he
always
spoke
of
her
as
the
lady
of
his
dreams
will
you
not
be
seated
miss
baynard
he
now
said
as
he
brought
forward
a
substantial
stool
the
only
thing
except
his
pallet
he
had
to
sit
on
my
accommodation
is
of
the
simplest
as
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
however
is
not
my
fault
but
an
oversight
shall
we
call
it
on
the
part
of
my
custodians
whose
affection
for
me
is
so
extreme
that
they
can
not
bear
to
part
from
me
so
nell
sat
down
on
the
stool
while
dare
stood
a
little
apart
with
folded
arms
resting
a
shoulder
against
the
whitewashed
wall
of
his
cell
miss
baynard
cleared
her
voice
the
crucial
moment
had
come
at
last
i
am
not
here
this
evening
dare
merely
to
sympathize
with
you
she
resumed
although
that
my
most
heartfelt
sympathy
is
yours
needs
no
assurance
on
my
part
but
to
put
before
you
a
certain
definite
proposition
which
has
been
carefully
thought
out
in
all
its
details
and
the
carrying
out
of
which
seems
to
me
perfectly
feasible
here
in
the
fewest
words
possible
necessarily
few
because
half
an
hour
at
the
outside
must
bring
my
visit
to
an
end
is
my
proposition
it
is
simply
that
you
and
i
shall
change
places
in
half
a
hour
from
now
you
shall
quit
this
cell
in
the
guise
of
elinor
baynard
and
i
shall
stay
where
i
am
having
for
the
nonce
exchanged
my
personality
for
that
of
geoffrey
dare
dare
had
sprung
to
attention
long
before
nell
had
come
to
an
end
a
wave
of
dark
crimson
swept
across
his
lean
face
leaving
it
sallower
than
before
his
eyes
lighted
up
with
an
intense
glow
would
any
woman
he
asked
himself
any
woman
who
was
young
and
beautiful
put
such
a
proposition
to
a
man
if
she
did
not
love
him
it
was
a
question
he
did
not
wait
to
answer
he
would
have
time
enough
to
consider
it
later
on
never
had
an
undeserving
man
a
more
noble
offer
made
him
than
you
have
just
made
me
but
putting
aside
the
insuperable
difficulties
in
the
way
of
carrying
it
out
there
are
other
reasons
which
there
are
no
insuperable
difficulties
in
the
way
of
carrying
it
out
broke
in
nell
every
arrangement
has
been
made
as
you
shall
presently
hear
but
remember
this
that
we
have
no
time
to
waste
in
explanations
or
idle
objections
dare
bowed
as
accepting
a
correction
then
permit
me
to
say
as
briefly
as
may
be
miss
baynard
that
it
can
not
be
that
on
no
account
whatever
could
i
or
would
i
accept
such
a
sacrifice
at
your
hands
a
sacrifice
oh
the
mockery
of
the
phrase
although
she
spoke
aloud
the
words
seemed
addressed
to
herself
rather
than
to
dare
she
had
removed
her
riding
gloves
and
the
long
slender
fingers
of
one
hand
now
gripped
those
of
the
other
convulsively
her
sharp
white
teeth
bit
into
her
underlip
and
left
their
mark
there
she
seemed
to
be
bracing
herself
for
a
final
effort
you
are
no
doubt
aware
she
resumed
that
your
trial
will
come
on
in
about
three
weeks
from
now
that
is
a
circumstance
i
am
not
likely
to
forget
and
have
you
considered
have
you
allowed
your
imagination
to
paint
for
you
what
the
consequence
will
be
should
the
verdict
at
your
trial
go
against
you
as
considering
the
evidence
which
will
be
brought
against
me
it
is
nearly
sure
to
do
yes
i
have
fully
considered
the
consequence
and
may
be
said
to
be
on
pretty
familiar
terms
with
it
by
this
time
but
as
for
my
imagination
i
trust
it
is
too
to
allow
itself
to
dwell
unnecessarily
on
details
which
are
best
kept
in
the
background
till
the
latest
possible
moment
and
the
prospect
does
not
appall
you
appall
me
no
is
not
a
pleasant
one
i
admit
but
what
would
you
i
played
a
game
with
fate
the
dice
went
against
me
and
i
have
lost
that
however
is
no
reason
why
i
should
bewail
myself
like
a
puling
child
or
why
my
cheek
should
blanch
at
the
prospect
which
i
shall
presently
be
called
upon
to
confront
but
will
you
not
see
can
not
you
comprehend
that
a
door
of
escape
is
open
for
you
her
voice
had
in
it
a
ring
of
almost
passionate
impatience
the
precious
minutes
were
drifting
away
one
by
one
possibly
so
but
only
at
an
expense
which
i
do
not
choose
to
incur
oh
what
headstrong
folly
did
the
world
ever
see
its
like
and
you
would
rather
face
your
your
doom
than
accept
this
sacrifice
as
you
choose
to
call
it
at
my
hands
even
so
i
have
said
it
and
nothing
will
avail
to
move
me
from
it
for
a
moment
or
two
she
beat
her
hands
together
in
an
agony
of
helplessness
then
she
stood
up
her
face
was
colorless
and
her
forehead
contracted
as
if
with
a
spasm
of
intense
pain
you
do
not
know
how
cruel
you
are
she
said
in
low
concentrated
tones
you
drag
from
me
things
which
i
thought
never
to
reveal
to
a
living
soul
she
paused
for
a
space
of
as
though
fighting
against
some
hidden
emotion
then
she
went
on
should
it
be
your
fate
to
die
geoffrey
dare
the
same
day
that
ends
your
life
shall
end
mine
i
swear
it
she
lifted
up
her
hands
and
let
her
face
sink
into
them
an
inarticulate
cry
broke
from
dare
a
great
light
leapt
into
his
eyes
he
drew
a
step
nearer
and
held
out
both
his
arms
then
he
half
drew
back
with
his
arms
extended
in
such
words
unless
i
am
a
bad
interpreter
can
have
but
one
meaning
he
seemed
to
breathe
the
syllables
rather
than
to
speak
them
for
a
few
seconds
there
was
no
reply
and
when
it
did
come
he
had
to
strain
his
ears
or
he
would
have
lost
it
your
shall
be
mine
i
have
said
it
is
not
that
enough
a
moment
later
his
arms
were
about
her
and
he
was
straining
her
passionately
to
his
heart
and
you
love
me
me
he
ejaculated
oh
miracle
of
miracles
sweet
to
him
as
a
breath
from
paradise
was
the
whispered
answer
i
have
loved
you
ever
since
the
night
you
were
so
kind
to
jack
prentice
it
was
three
minutes
later
with
what
passed
in
the
interim
we
are
in
no
way
concerned
but
consider
my
darling
think
and
consider
before
it
is
too
late
urged
dare
that
miss
baynard
of
stanbrook
should
stoop
to
love
captain
nightshade
a
highwayman
a
minion
of
the
moon
no
it
must
not
be
and
i
i
should
be
a
scoundrel
to
accept
so
great
a
gift
unless
a
hand
was
laid
on
his
lips
oh
hush
i
will
not
listen
to
such
words
you
steal
away
a
poor
girl
heart
and
then
you
bid
her
think
and
consider
too
late
too
late
but
never
never
will
i
forgive
you
for
having
wrung
my
secret
from
me
yet
what
am
i
saying
on
one
condition
i
will
forgive
you
fully
and
freely
and
that
is
that
without
a
word
more
of
demur
you
do
your
share
in
helping
me
to
carry
out
the
scheme
which
brought
me
here
what
that
scheme
is
i
have
already
told
you
but
my
dearest
for
the
second
time
a
hand
was
laid
on
his
lips
not
a
word
i
will
not
listen
you
will
do
it
if
not
for
your
own
sake
then
for
mine
do
you
hear
for
mine
for
yours
then
let
it
be
he
assented
but
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
see
by
what
means
she
purposed
carrying
out
her
extraordinary
proposition
the
prison
clock
began
to
boom
the
hour
miss
baynard
started
heavens
our
little
slice
of
time
more
than
half
gone
and
nothing
done
then
without
a
word
more
she
untied
her
short
gray
cloak
and
laid
it
aside
under
it
she
had
on
a
loosely
fitting
bodice
and
her
long
riding
skirt
both
of
which
garments
a
couple
a
minutes
later
lay
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
and
then
to
dare
astonished
eyes
there
stood
revealed
the
seeming
figure
of
a
young
man
wearing
a
ruffled
shirt
and
cravat
a
pair
of
dark
small
clothes
and
hessian
boots
all
at
one
time
the
property
of
unfortunate
dick
cortelyon
only
the
plumed
hat
the
veil
and
the
heavy
chestnut
curls
still
remained
to
bespeak
their
owner
sex
but
nell
hands
went
quickly
up
to
her
head
there
were
a
few
deft
movements
of
her
fingers
and
the
whole
paraphernalia
hat
veil
and
ringlets
came
bodily
away
well
might
dare
eyes
open
themselves
still
wider
before
leaving
home
she
had
shorn
off
her
wealth
of
tresses
and
then
by
means
of
some
feminine
had
contrived
to
secure
them
to
the
inner
side
of
her
hat
in
such
a
way
that
when
the
hat
was
worn
the
curls
lay
in
quite
natural
fashion
round
the
nape
of
the
neck
nor
was
dare
wonder
yet
to
end
from
a
pocket
in
her
nell
now
drew
forth
a
black
wig
a
masquerade
relic
of
poor
dick
and
proceeded
to
draw
it
on
over
her
chestnut
locks
then
turning
to
her
companion
who
had
been
regarding
her
all
this
time
without
a
word
she
said
in
tones
your
coat
and
vest
sir
or
your
life
at
once
dare
divested
himself
of
the
articles
in
question
and
when
nell
had
inducted
herself
into
them
her
transformation
was
complete
and
a
very
dashing
and
debonair
young
buck
she
looked
and
now
it
is
high
time
for
miss
baynard
to
make
toilet
she
remarked
but
such
an
awkward
young
woman
is
she
that
it
may
be
as
well
i
should
lend
her
a
helping
hand
dare
who
recognized
the
futility
of
any
further
opposition
yielded
himself
into
her
hands
and
did
exactly
as
she
bade
him
although
nell
was
tall
he
was
three
inches
taller
than
she
but
the
riding
skirt
admitted
of
ample
allowance
for
the
difference
when
however
it
came
to
the
bodice
that
garment
cracked
ominously
and
the
hooks
and
eyes
wholly
refused
to
come
together
but
happily
the
gray
cloak
was
ample
enough
to
hide
all
shortcomings
illustration
your
coat
and
vest
sir
or
your
life
lastly
the
elaborate
headdress
hat
veil
and
curls
had
to
be
adjusted
this
was
a
matter
of
some
nicety
but
presently
it
was
accomplished
to
miss
baynard
satisfaction
then
stepping
back
a
pace
she
took
a
general
survey
of
her
handiwork
yes
i
think
do
she
said
although
you
do
look
so
preternaturally
tall
on
no
account
must
you
either
speak
or
cough
and
do
for
goodness
sake
try
to
mitigate
that
stride
of
yours
i
suppose
that
try
as
you
might
you
could
mince
or
bridle
a
little
as
all
young
ladies
are
supposed
to
do
although
she
spoke
with
such
seeming
levity
her
nerves
were
all
with
mingled
apprehension
and
excitement
she
felt
as
if
she
were
strapped
down
on
the
operating
table
and
waiting
for
the
coming
of
the
surgeon
with
his
terrible
knife
the
only
remark
made
by
dare
during
the
process
of
his
transformation
was
when
nell
was
on
the
point
of
crowning
him
with
the
hat
and
curls
with
a
caressing
touch
on
one
of
the
tresses
he
said
oh
my
dear
one
to
think
you
should
have
done
this
for
me
what
a
sacrifice
can
i
ever
forgive
you
of
course
you
can
she
answered
lightly
am
i
not
making
you
a
present
of
the
rubbish
to
do
what
you
like
with
some
lovers
think
themselves
well
off
if
they
can
secure
a
tiny
tress
of
their
hair
but
so
great
is
generosity
that
i
freely
present
you
with
enough
to
stuff
a
sofa
cushion
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
passionately
but
now
was
heard
a
faint
sound
as
of
the
unlocking
and
opening
of
a
door
in
the
distance
and
then
heralded
by
a
cough
the
noise
of
approaching
footsteps
on
the
flagged
floor
of
the
corridor
instead
of
a
bare
thirty
minutes
our
young
people
had
been
nearly
an
hour
together
whether
the
guineas
and
the
brandy
were
in
any
way
concerned
with
such
a
liberal
measurement
of
time
is
more
than
one
would
undertake
to
decide
the
time
to
part
has
come
said
nell
in
a
hurried
whisper
listen
my
man
john
dyce
is
waiting
outside
in
charge
of
my
mare
he
may
be
trusted
implicitly
he
has
had
his
instructions
and
will
ask
no
questions
the
future
i
leave
wholly
in
your
hands
more
was
impossible
the
turnkey
was
at
the
door
after
a
preliminary
rap
on
it
he
called
out
time
up
long
since
mum
are
you
ready
quite
ready
william
thank
you
was
miss
baynard
clear
response
so
william
unlocked
the
door
and
drew
it
back
on
its
hinges
what
he
saw
when
he
had
done
so
was
his
prisoner
as
it
seemed
to
him
seated
on
his
pallet
in
a
dejected
attitude
with
bowed
head
and
his
elbows
resting
on
his
knees
nor
did
he
so
much
as
look
up
at
the
opening
of
the
door
just
inside
waiting
apparently
for
the
opening
of
the
door
and
with
her
back
to
the
candle
was
the
young
lady
visitor
whose
face
was
now
wholly
hidden
by
her
veil
as
soon
as
the
door
was
opened
she
passed
out
without
a
word
and
then
stood
aside
for
a
moment
while
it
was
shut
and
relocked
that
done
william
swinging
his
and
not
it
must
sorrowfully
be
confessed
quite
so
steady
on
his
feet
as
he
had
been
earlier
in
the
evening
led
the
way
in
happy
ignorance
of
the
peck
of
trouble
he
was
brewing
for
himself
hardly
was
the
cell
door
shut
before
nell
was
kneeling
by
it
with
one
ear
pressed
to
its
cold
iron
surface
the
footsteps
died
into
silence
then
as
before
was
heard
the
clash
of
a
distant
door
and
after
that
all
was
still
with
a
stillness
as
of
the
tomb
then
nell
stood
up
a
great
calm
a
great
happiness
almost
shining
out
of
her
eyes
if
only
i
have
succeeded
in
saving
him
she
said
aloud
nothing
else
matters
but
next
moment
her
overwrought
nerves
gave
way
staggering
across
the
floor
and
flinging
herself
face
downward
on
the
pallet
she
burst
into
a
tempest
of
tears
chapter
xxvii
three
years
after
dare
to
lady
my
dear
godmother
your
last
letter
to
hand
five
days
ago
brought
me
a
large
measure
of
happiness
in
it
you
tell
me
that
you
have
at
length
forgiven
me
in
full
for
what
heretofore
you
have
always
designated
as
my
and
marriage
it
does
indeed
make
me
glad
to
learn
that
i
am
once
more
to
be
taken
back
fully
and
freely
into
your
affections
the
loss
of
which
has
been
the
bitterest
drop
in
the
cup
of
my
married
felicity
in
your
letter
you
put
several
questions
to
me
having
reference
to
the
events
of
the
last
few
weeks
prior
to
my
departure
from
england
these
i
will
now
endeavor
to
answer
to
the
best
of
my
ability
thanks
to
the
interest
brought
to
bear
by
your
ladyship
in
a
certain
high
quarter
your
scapegrace
goddaughter
after
having
made
three
appearances
before
the
lanchester
bench
of
magistrates
was
unceremoniously
set
at
liberty
this
of
course
is
ancient
history
to
you
but
it
is
the
point
from
which
for
your
information
i
purpose
narrating
as
briefly
as
may
be
what
befell
me
afterwards
up
to
the
date
of
my
departure
for
america
i
had
only
been
a
couple
of
days
back
at
stanbrook
when
a
note
reached
me
which
had
been
brought
by
a
man
on
horseback
the
writer
of
it
was
of
rockmount
whose
acquaintance
i
had
made
some
time
before
under
rather
peculiar
circumstances
asking
me
to
go
back
with
his
messenger
as
the
writer
had
some
news
of
importance
to
communicate
this
i
had
no
hesitation
about
doing
seeing
that
ellerslie
was
known
to
me
as
the
uncle
of
geoffrey
dare
a
couple
of
hours
later
i
alighted
from
my
mare
at
the
door
of
rockmount
a
man
between
sixty
and
seventy
tall
and
bowed
habited
in
a
monkish
robe
with
a
moustache
and
a
short
peaked
beard
long
grizzled
hair
parted
down
the
middle
and
a
singular
waxen
pallor
of
complexion
such
was
the
ellerslie
known
to
me
and
such
was
the
man
who
now
received
me
i
had
assumed
that
it
was
in
order
to
be
favored
with
some
tidings
of
or
to
receive
some
message
from
his
nephew
who
had
been
utterly
lost
to
me
from
the
moment
the
cell
door
was
shut
between
us
that
i
had
been
summoned
to
rockmount
nor
was
i
mistaken
after
having
referred
to
the
lanchester
affair
in
terms
which
i
would
not
recapitulate
even
if
i
could
ellerslie
went
on
to
mark
that
his
nephew
had
not
yet
left
the
country
but
was
in
safe
hiding
no
great
distance
away
proceeding
he
went
on
to
observe
that
he
was
the
bearer
of
a
certain
message
from
geoffrey
but
that
he
found
himself
somewhat
at
a
loss
for
terms
in
which
to
convey
it
stripped
however
of
all
verbiage
it
came
to
this
geoffrey
would
not
hold
me
to
my
word
or
promise
given
him
in
the
cell
at
lanchester
if
since
then
and
after
further
consideration
i
in
the
slightest
degree
regretted
or
wished
to
recall
anything
which
had
passed
between
us
on
that
occasion
then
before
i
had
time
to
frame
into
words
the
answer
which
leapt
from
my
heart
ellerslie
proceeded
to
address
me
on
his
own
account
i
was
young
and
parentless
he
remarked
and
so
far
as
he
could
judge
somewhat
liable
to
be
led
away
by
generous
but
undisciplined
impulses
he
begged
of
me
to
pause
to
reflect
coolly
and
dispassionately
before
linking
my
lot
with
that
of
a
man
who
should
no
worse
fate
befall
him
must
henceforth
be
an
outcast
from
his
native
land
and
so
on
and
so
on
till
i
begged
of
him
to
cease
need
i
tell
you
my
dear
godmother
in
what
terms
i
answered
him
no
i
am
sure
i
need
not
you
know
your
nelly
too
well
not
to
have
guessed
already
the
pith
of
all
i
had
to
say
was
comprised
in
less
than
a
score
words
dare
is
my
chosen
husband
and
come
weal
or
woe
i
will
wed
none
but
him
ellerslie
threw
up
his
hands
you
will
persist
my
dear
young
lady
in
your
headstrong
course
then
have
i
nothing
more
to
urge
my
ambassadorial
functions
are
at
an
end
and
the
sooner
my
nephew
comes
and
does
his
own
talking
the
better
for
all
concerned
without
a
word
more
he
rose
and
left
the
room
and
five
minutes
later
geoffrey
entered
it
to
relate
what
passed
between
him
and
me
would
not
entertain
you
in
the
least
it
will
be
enough
to
state
that
if
we
had
not
been
betrothed
lovers
before
we
became
so
from
that
hour
it
was
to
rockmount
that
geoffrey
had
directed
his
steps
on
the
night
of
his
escape
and
there
he
had
been
in
hiding
ever
since
when
the
time
had
come
for
me
to
take
my
departure
in
order
that
i
might
get
back
to
stanbrook
before
dark
i
said
to
him
shall
i
not
see
ellerslie
again
before
i
go
you
certainly
will
not
he
replied
with
one
of
his
puzzling
smiles
is
no
longer
in
existence
he
died
about
an
hour
ago
his
life
was
brief
but
necessary
peace
to
his
remains
then
seeing
my
look
of
amazement
he
added
you
not
yet
found
out
or
even
suspected
that
ellerslie
and
geoffrey
dare
were
one
and
the
same
person
no
that
i
certainly
had
not
nevertheless
i
was
now
assured
that
such
was
the
fact
and
i
had
to
delay
my
departure
for
another
half
hour
while
the
mystery
was
cleared
up
for
me
when
geoffrey
dare
left
london
a
ruined
man
bankrupt
in
love
in
friendship
in
means
i
long
ago
explained
to
you
under
what
peculiar
circumstances
he
was
induced
to
take
to
the
king
highway
he
came
to
rockmount
which
was
his
own
property
and
which
owing
doubtless
to
its
isolated
situation
in
the
midst
of
a
wide
stretch
of
desolate
moorland
had
been
untenanted
for
years
with
him
he
brought
three
old
family
servants
whom
not
even
the
rack
or
the
thumbscrew
would
have
forced
into
betraying
him
but
it
was
the
scholar
and
the
recluse
who
had
become
the
tenant
of
rockmount
and
no
faintest
suspicion
ever
got
abroad
that
there
was
or
could
be
any
connection
between
him
and
captain
nightshade
so
far
so
good
but
i
still
failed
to
comprehend
the
nature
of
a
disguise
which
so
completely
changed
geoffrey
identity
that
only
an
hour
before
my
eyes
had
failed
to
penetrate
it
to
take
one
point
alone
in
ellerslie
face
leaving
out
of
account
the
difference
in
the
complexions
there
bad
been
a
thousand
fine
lines
and
creases
whereas
in
geoffrey
it
would
have
puzzled
one
to
find
a
dozen
then
was
i
enlightened
face
was
a
mask
of
which
moustache
beard
eyebrows
and
hair
formed
component
parts
the
foundation
of
the
mask
consisted
of
the
skin
of
a
kid
pared
or
scraped
to
an
exceeding
fineness
and
moulded
to
the
features
while
still
plastic
geoffrey
had
brought
it
with
him
from
italy
several
years
before
where
such
disguises
seem
to
be
not
unknown
and
where
it
had
been
made
for
him
in
order
that
he
might
take
part
in
a
certain
carnival
frolic
so
simple
sometimes
is
the
explanation
of
an
apparently
inscrutable
mystery
but
my
letter
is
dragging
itself
out
to
an
unconscionable
length
and
i
must
hurry
on
of
a
certain
quiet
wedding
in
holland
and
of
the
of
the
two
people
concerned
for
the
united
states
i
have
no
particulars
worth
recounting
beyond
those
already
known
to
you
here
they
have
lived
happily
ever
since
and
here
whatever
they
may
have
felt
in
secret
they
had
made
up
their
minds
to
pass
the
rest
of
their
days
when
a
passage
in
your
last
letter
set
their
hearts
dancing
with
a
happiness
so
that
since
it
burst
into
their
life
like
a
flash
of
sunlight
they
have
hardly
been
able
to
talk
about
anything
else
you
write
my
dear
godmother
that
you
have
fair
hopes
of
being
able
by
and
by
through
bringing
your
influence
to
bear
in
the
same
quarter
in
which
you
brought
it
to
bear
once
before
to
secure
for
geoffrey
a
free
pardon
what
two
happy
and
grateful
beings
you
would
in
that
case
make
of
my
husband
and
me
i
should
fail
to
tell
you
in
any
words
you
are
kind
enough
to
say
further
that
you
miss
your
nelly
face
and
long
to
see
it
again
as
also
that
there
is
a
big
corner
for
her
in
your
will
we
will
say
nothing
about
the
latter
but
as
regards
the
former
let
me
whisper
in
your
ear
that
you
need
not
be
very
much
surprised
if
you
see
me
in
london
in
the
course
of
next
season
if
geoffrey
should
be
free
to
come
with
me
what
happiness
that
would
be
but
in
any
case
i
think
you
may
look
forward
pretty
confidently
to
seeing
your
vagrant
goddaughter
you
will
readily
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
i
am
also
very
desirous
of
setting
eyes
again
on
my
young
kinsman
evan
cortelyon
the
account
of
whose
abduction
and
recovery
had
for
you
such
a
special
interest
do
forget
please
that
his
recovery
was
wholly
due
to
my
dear
husband
he
has
been
made
a
ward
in
chancery
and
although
i
have
frequent
news
of
him
and
am
assured
that
he
is
well
and
happy
yet
that
is
not
like
seeing
him
and
feeling
his
dear
arms
about
my
neck
what
you
had
to
tell
me
in
your
last
letter
anent
the
hon
bullivant
took
me
by
surprise
as
you
said
it
would
but
i
afraid
my
disposition
is
not
of
a
sufficiently
forgiving
kind
to
allow
of
my
stating
with
any
regard
for
truth
that
i
feel
sorry
for
her
because
i
certainly
do
nothing
of
the
kind
my
surprise
arises
from
the
fact
that
she
of
all
women
i
have
ever
known
the
most
unlikely
should
have
allowed
herself
to
be
so
thoroughly
hoodwinked
as
she
seems
to
have
been
over
her
marriage
with
the
earl
of
mortlake
of
course
she
was
dazzled
by
the
prospect
of
becoming
a
countess
and
by
the
likelihood
you
say
she
regarded
it
as
a
certainty
that
in
less
than
a
twelvemonth
she
would
be
left
a
widow
a
titled
widow
with
a
handsome
jointure
such
a
mere
wreck
of
humanity
was
his
lordship
to
all
seeming
when
she
accepted
him
besides
being
more
than
double
her
age
if
this
latter
consideration
was
and
you
appear
to
have
no
doubt
on
the
point
her
chief
reason
for
becoming
his
wife
then
indeed
must
her
awakening
have
been
anything
but
a
pleasant
one
when
she
found
that
the
man
who
had
been
carried
into
the
church
by
four
of
his
tenants
so
feeble
did
he
seem
was
able
as
soon
as
the
ceremony
was
over
not
merely
to
walk
unassisted
out
of
the
sacred
edifice
but
to
offer
his
bride
the
support
of
his
arm
what
a
genuine
comedy
scene
it
must
have
been
for
everybody
there
save
and
except
her
ladyship
and
now
you
tell
me
that
his
lordship
is
likely
to
live
for
a
dozen
years
to
come
i
know
that
he
has
been
married
twice
before
and
that
he
has
the
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
most
brutal
and
unfeeling
of
husbands
a
reputation
with
which
it
is
hard
to
believe
his
present
wife
can
have
been
unacquainted
yes
on
consideration
i
think
i
can
afford
to
forget
bygones
and
to
spare
a
little
pity
for
my
lady
countess
hers
is
indeed
an
unhappy
fate
nor
will
she
derive
much
consolation
from
the
knowledge
that
she
owes
it
wholly
to
herself
i
have
kept
a
very
singular
bit
of
news
till
the
last
you
may
remember
that
when
we
came
here
we
brought
with
us
the
dumb
man
andry
luce
who
had
been
my
uncle
cortelyon
secretary
and
factotum
and
about
whom
you
have
often
heard
me
speak
notwithstanding
his
infirmity
geoffrey
found
him
very
useful
in
keeping
the
books
and
accounts
of
the
large
property
of
which
my
husband
has
the
management
he
was
deeply
attached
to
me
and
i
had
a
very
warm
regard
for
him
well
i
am
grieved
to
have
to
relate
that
the
poor
fellow
has
come
to
a
sad
end
about
a
fortnight
ago
he
was
fatally
injured
while
trying
to
stop
a
runaway
horse
and
vehicle
some
days
passed
before
he
succumbed
to
his
injuries
and
it
was
while
he
lay
dying
i
am
thankful
to
say
he
did
not
suffer
much
that
he
confessed
something
to
me
which
perhaps
i
might
otherwise
have
gone
to
the
grave
without
knowing
you
and
i
my
dear
godmother
in
days
gone
by
more
than
once
bewildered
our
brains
in
trying
to
solve
the
mystery
of
my
unsigned
will
for
if
he
had
not
believed
it
to
be
signed
why
should
he
have
been
so
anxious
in
his
last
moments
as
he
certainly
was
to
have
it
destroyed
this
was
the
puzzle
which
andry
confession
spelled
out
to
me
word
by
word
on
his
fingers
after
the
manner
of
dumb
people
solved
once
for
all
andry
was
in
the
habit
of
dabbling
in
chemicals
in
his
spare
moments
and
it
was
with
a
chemically
prepared
ink
manufactured
by
him
specially
for
the
purpose
that
the
will
was
signed
by
the
testator
and
the
witnesses
the
special
property
of
the
ink
in
question
was
that
within
hours
of
its
having
been
used
anything
written
with
it
would
fade
out
of
existence
leaving
nothing
but
the
blank
unsullied
paper
where
it
had
been
of
course
it
was
a
very
wicked
thing
of
andry
to
do
but
he
had
somehow
learnt
the
contents
of
the
will
and
his
indignation
at
the
iniquity
of
its
provisions
seems
to
have
utterly
confused
his
sense
of
right
and
wrong
as
i
verily
believe
it
would
have
done
mine
had
i
been
in
his
place
if
you
ask
me
what
notice
i
intend
taking
of
the
information
which
has
thus
strangely
come
into
my
keeping
i
answer
none
at
all
and
it
is
a
view
in
which
my
husband
bears
me
out
i
hold
myself
to
be
wholly
absolved
from
taking
any
action
whatever
in
the
affair
because
my
uncle
last
wish
nay
his
positive
command
was
that
the
will
in
question
should
be
destroyed
and
thus
after
all
his
dying
wish
was
carried
out
but
in
a
way
certainly
never
contemplated
by
him
the
end
