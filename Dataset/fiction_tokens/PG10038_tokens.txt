that
a
man
hath
is
a
sweet
life
but
he
that
findeth
a
treasure
is
above
them
of
course
they
were
bound
for
the
klondyke
every
creature
in
the
was
bound
for
the
klondyke
men
from
the
south
too
and
men
from
the
east
had
left
their
ploughs
and
their
pens
their
factories
pulpits
and
each
man
like
a
magnetic
needle
suddenly
set
free
and
turning
sharply
to
the
north
all
set
pointing
the
way
since
that
july
day
in
when
the
sailed
into
san
francisco
harbour
bringing
from
the
uttermost
regions
at
the
top
of
the
map
close
upon
a
million
dollars
in
nuggets
and
in
some
distance
this
side
of
the
arctic
circle
on
the
right
bank
of
the
yukon
a
little
detachment
of
that
great
army
pressing
northward
had
been
wrecked
early
in
the
month
of
september
they
had
realised
on
leaving
the
ship
that
landed
them
at
michael
island
near
the
mouth
of
the
great
river
that
they
could
not
hope
to
reach
dawson
that
year
but
instead
of
getting
cold
feet
as
the
phrase
for
discouragement
ran
and
turning
back
as
thousands
did
or
putting
in
the
winter
on
the
coast
they
determined
with
an
eye
to
the
spring
rush
to
cover
as
many
as
possible
of
the
seventeen
hundred
miles
of
waterway
before
navigation
closed
they
knew
in
a
vague
way
that
winter
would
come
early
but
they
had
not
counted
on
the
big
september
storm
that
dashed
their
boats
against
the
ultimately
drove
them
ashore
and
nearly
cost
the
little
party
their
lives
on
that
last
day
of
the
long
struggle
up
the
stream
a
stiff
was
cutting
the
middle
reach
of
the
mighty
river
two
miles
wide
here
into
a
choppy
and
dangerous
sea
day
by
day
five
men
in
the
two
little
boats
had
kept
serious
eyes
on
the
shore
then
came
the
morning
when
out
of
the
monotonous
cold
and
something
new
appeared
a
narrow
white
rim
forming
on
the
river
margin
the
first
ice
winter
beginning
to
show
his
teeth
said
one
man
with
an
effort
at
jocosity
day
by
day
nearer
came
the
menace
narrower
and
swifter
still
ran
the
deep
black
water
strip
between
the
encroaching
but
the
thought
that
each
day
sailing
or
rowing
meant
many
days
nearer
the
klondyke
seemed
to
inspire
a
superhuman
energy
day
by
day
each
man
had
felt
and
no
man
yet
had
said
we
must
camp
for
eight
months
they
had
looked
landward
shivered
and
held
on
their
way
but
on
this
particular
morning
when
they
took
in
sail
they
realised
it
was
to
be
that
abomination
of
desolation
on
the
shore
or
death
and
one
or
other
speedily
nearer
the
white
teeth
gleamed
fiercer
the
gale
swifter
the
current
sweeping
back
the
boats
the
was
left
behind
fighting
for
life
while
it
seemed
as
if
no
human
power
could
keep
the
from
being
hurled
against
the
western
shore
twice
in
spite
of
all
they
could
do
she
was
driven
within
a
few
feet
of
what
looked
like
certain
death
with
a
huge
effort
that
last
time
her
little
crew
had
just
got
her
well
in
when
a
heavy
roller
breaking
on
the
starboard
side
drenched
the
men
and
half
filled
the
cockpit
each
rower
still
pulling
for
dear
life
with
one
hand
bailed
the
boat
with
the
other
but
for
all
their
promptness
a
certain
amount
of
the
water
froze
solid
before
they
could
get
it
out
great
luck
if
we
going
to
take
in
water
like
this
said
the
cheerful
kentuckian
shipping
his
oar
and
knocking
off
the
ice
great
luck
that
all
the
stores
are
so
well
protected
protected
snapped
out
an
anxious
man
at
the
rudder
yes
protected
how
water
to
get
through
the
that
over
everything
the
steersman
set
his
jaw
grimly
they
seemed
to
be
comparatively
safe
now
with
half
a
mile
of
open
water
between
them
and
the
western
shore
but
they
sat
as
before
stiff
alert
each
man
in
his
ice
jacket
that
cracked
and
crunched
as
he
bent
to
his
oar
now
right
now
left
again
they
eyed
the
shore
would
it
be
could
it
be
there
they
would
have
to
land
and
if
they
did
lord
how
it
blew
hard
called
out
the
steersman
there
just
ahead
was
a
great
roller
coming
coming
the
biggest
wave
they
had
encountered
since
leaving
open
sea
but
maccann
the
steersman
swung
the
boat
straight
into
the
crested
roller
and
the
took
it
gamely
bow
on
all
was
going
well
when
just
in
the
boiling
middle
of
what
they
had
thought
was
foaming
the
boat
struck
something
solid
shivered
and
went
shooting
down
half
under
water
recovered
up
again
and
seemed
to
pause
in
a
second
doubt
on
the
very
top
of
the
great
wave
in
that
second
that
seemed
an
eternity
one
man
courage
snapped
potts
threw
down
his
oar
and
swore
by
and
by
he
would
pull
another
stroke
on
the
yukon
while
he
was
pouring
out
the
words
the
steersman
sprang
from
the
tiller
and
seized
potts
oar
just
in
time
to
save
the
boat
from
capsizing
then
he
and
the
big
kentuckian
both
turned
on
the
distracted
potts
you
infernal
quitter
shouted
the
steersman
and
choked
with
fury
but
even
under
the
insult
of
that
meanest
word
in
the
language
potts
sat
glaring
defiantly
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
it
ai
a
river
anyhow
this
ai
he
said
it
plain
simple
hell
and
water
the
others
had
no
time
to
realise
that
potts
was
clean
out
of
his
senses
for
the
moment
and
the
kentuckian
still
pulling
like
mad
faced
the
quitter
with
a
determination
born
of
terror
if
you
ca
row
take
the
rudder
damnation
take
that
rudder
quick
we
kill
and
he
half
rose
up
never
dropping
his
oar
blindly
potts
obeyed
the
was
free
now
from
the
clinging
mass
at
the
bow
but
they
knew
they
had
struck
their
first
floe
farther
on
they
could
see
other
bringing
other
ice
masses
down
but
there
was
no
time
for
terrors
ahead
the
gale
was
steadily
driving
them
in
shore
again
boat
and
oars
alike
were
growing
unwieldy
with
their
coating
of
ice
and
human
strength
was
no
match
for
the
storm
that
was
sweeping
down
from
the
pole
lord
how
it
blew
there
a
cove
called
out
the
kentuckian
throw
her
in
he
shouted
to
potts
sullenly
the
new
steersman
obeyed
rolling
in
on
a
great
surge
the
boat
suddenly
turned
in
a
boiling
eddy
and
the
first
thing
anybody
knew
was
that
the
was
on
her
side
and
her
crew
in
the
water
potts
was
hanging
on
to
the
gunwale
and
damning
the
others
for
not
helping
him
to
save
the
boat
she
was
much
of
a
boat
when
finally
they
got
her
into
quiet
water
but
the
main
thing
was
they
had
escaped
with
their
lives
and
rescued
a
good
proportion
of
their
winter
provisions
all
the
while
they
were
doing
this
last
the
kentuckian
kept
turning
to
look
anxiously
for
any
sign
of
the
others
in
his
heart
bitterly
blaming
himself
for
having
agreed
to
potts
coming
into
the
that
day
in
place
of
the
kentuckian
own
pardner
when
they
had
piled
the
rescued
provisions
up
on
the
bank
and
just
as
they
were
covering
the
heap
of
bacon
flour
and
boxes
tools
and
utensils
with
a
tarpaulin
up
went
a
shout
and
the
two
missing
men
appeared
tramping
along
the
shore
where
was
the
well
she
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
yukon
and
her
crew
would
like
some
supper
they
set
up
a
tent
and
went
to
bed
that
first
night
extremely
well
pleased
at
being
alive
on
any
terms
but
people
get
over
being
glad
about
almost
anything
unless
misfortune
again
puts
an
edge
on
the
circumstance
the
next
day
not
being
in
any
immediate
danger
the
boon
of
mere
life
seemed
less
satisfying
in
detachments
they
went
up
the
river
several
miles
and
down
about
as
far
they
looked
in
vain
for
any
sign
of
the
they
prospected
the
hills
from
the
heights
behind
the
camp
they
got
a
pretty
fair
idea
of
the
surrounding
country
it
was
not
reassuring
as
to
products
there
seems
to
be
plenty
of
undersized
timber
plenty
of
snow
and
plenty
of
river
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
just
nothing
else
well
there
oodles
o
blueberries
said
the
boy
his
mouth
bearing
witness
to
veracity
and
there
are
black
and
red
currants
in
the
snow
and
oh
yes
returned
the
other
it
a
sort
of
garden
of
eden
a
little
below
here
it
was
four
miles
from
bank
to
bank
of
the
main
channel
but
at
this
point
the
river
was
only
about
two
miles
wide
and
white
already
with
floating
masses
of
going
on
a
swift
current
down
towards
the
sea
four
hundred
miles
away
the
right
bank
presented
to
the
mighty
river
a
low
chain
of
hills
fringed
at
the
base
with
a
scattered
growth
of
scrubby
spruce
birch
willow
and
timber
line
was
only
two
hundred
feet
above
the
river
brink
beyond
that
height
rocks
and
moss
covered
with
snow
but
if
their
side
seemed
cheerless
what
of
the
land
on
the
left
bank
a
swamp
stretching
endlessly
on
either
hand
and
back
from
the
icy
flood
as
far
as
eye
could
see
broken
only
by
sloughs
and
an
occasional
tarn
we
been
travelling
just
eight
weeks
to
arrive
at
this
said
the
kentuckian
looking
at
the
desolate
scene
with
a
homesick
eye
we
not
only
pretty
far
from
home
grumbled
another
we
still
thirteen
hundred
miles
away
from
the
klondyke
these
unenlivening
calculations
were
catching
we
just
about
hundred
miles
from
the
nearest
railroad
or
telegraph
and
now
that
winter
down
on
us
exactly
eight
months
from
anywhere
in
the
civilised
world
they
had
seen
no
sign
of
even
savage
life
no
white
trader
nothing
to
show
that
any
human
foot
had
ever
passed
that
way
before
in
that
stillness
that
was
like
the
stillness
of
death
they
went
up
the
hillside
with
footsteps
muffled
in
the
clinging
snow
and
sixty
feet
above
the
great
river
in
a
part
of
the
wood
where
the
timber
was
least
unpromising
they
marked
out
a
site
for
their
winter
quarters
then
this
queer
little
company
a
denver
an
from
nova
scotia
an
lawyer
from
san
francisco
a
kentucky
colonel
who
had
never
smelt
powder
and
the
boy
who
was
no
boy
at
all
but
a
man
of
these
five
set
to
work
felling
trees
clearing
away
the
snow
and
digging
foundations
for
a
couple
of
one
for
the
trio
as
they
called
themselves
the
other
for
the
colonel
and
the
boy
these
two
had
chummed
from
the
hour
they
met
on
the
steamer
that
carried
them
through
the
golden
gate
of
the
pacific
till
well
till
the
end
of
my
story
the
colonel
was
a
big
tanned
fellow
nearly
forty
eldest
of
the
party
whom
the
others
used
to
guy
discreetly
because
you
mention
a
place
anywhere
on
the
known
globe
except
the
far
north
which
he
had
not
personally
inspected
but
for
this
foible
as
the
untravelled
considered
it
he
was
well
liked
and
a
little
feared
except
by
the
boy
who
liked
him
and
feared
him
not
at
all
they
had
promptly
adopted
each
other
before
they
discovered
that
it
was
necessary
to
have
one
or
more
pardners
it
seemed
from
all
accounts
to
be
true
that
up
there
at
the
top
of
the
world
a
man
alone
is
a
man
lost
and
ultimately
the
party
was
added
to
as
aforesaid
only
two
of
them
knew
anything
about
roughing
it
jimmie
of
the
lawyer
had
seen
something
of
frontier
life
and
fled
it
and
maccann
the
nova
scotian
schoolmaster
had
spent
a
month
in
one
of
the
caribou
camps
and
on
the
strength
of
that
proudly
accepted
the
nickname
of
the
miner
colonel
george
warren
and
morris
burnet
the
boy
had
the
best
outfits
but
this
fact
was
held
to
be
more
than
by
the
value
of
the
schoolmaster
experience
at
caribou
and
by
the
extraordinary
handiness
of
potts
the
denver
clerk
who
had
helped
to
build
the
shelter
on
deck
for
the
disabled
sick
on
the
voyage
up
this
young
man
with
the
big
mouth
and
lazy
air
had
been
in
the
office
of
a
bank
ever
since
he
left
school
and
yet
under
pressure
he
discovered
a
natural
and
a
manual
dexterity
justly
envied
by
some
of
his
his
outfit
was
not
more
conspicuously
meagre
than
yet
the
irishman
was
held
to
be
the
moneyed
man
of
his
party
just
why
was
never
fully
developed
but
it
was
always
said
represents
capital
and
whether
on
that
account
or
for
a
subtler
and
more
efficient
reason
always
got
the
best
of
everything
that
was
going
without
money
and
without
price
on
board
ship
with
his
ready
tongue
and
his
golden
background
representing
capital
was
a
leading
spirit
potts
the
was
a
talker
too
and
a
good
second
but
once
in
camp
mac
the
miner
was
cock
of
the
walk
in
those
first
days
quoted
caribou
and
ordered
everybody
about
to
everybody
satisfaction
in
a
situation
like
this
the
strongest
lean
on
the
man
who
has
ever
seen
anything
like
it
before
it
was
a
comfort
that
anybody
even
he
knew
what
to
do
under
such
new
conditions
so
the
others
looked
on
with
admiration
and
a
pleasant
confidence
while
mac
boldly
cut
a
hole
in
the
tent
and
instructed
potts
how
to
make
a
flange
out
of
a
tin
plate
with
which
to
protect
the
canvas
from
the
heat
of
the
no
more
cooking
now
in
the
bitter
open
everyone
admired
mac
foresight
when
he
said
we
must
build
rock
fireplaces
in
our
cabins
or
we
find
our
one
little
yukon
stove
burnt
out
before
the
winter
is
over
before
we
have
a
chance
to
use
it
out
prospecting
and
when
mac
said
they
must
pool
their
stores
the
colonel
and
the
boy
agreed
as
readily
as
whose
stores
consisted
of
a
little
bacon
some
navy
beans
and
a
demijohn
of
whisky
however
urged
that
probably
every
man
had
a
little
mite
o
somethin
that
he
had
brought
specially
for
himself
somethin
his
friends
had
given
him
for
instance
there
was
potts
now
they
all
knew
how
the
future
potts
had
brought
a
down
to
the
steamer
when
she
came
to
say
and
made
potts
promise
he
would
unseal
the
packet
till
christmas
it
do
to
pool
potts
cake
never
there
was
the
colonel
the
only
man
that
had
a
sack
of
coffee
he
would
listen
when
they
had
told
him
tea
was
the
stuff
up
here
and
well
perhaps
other
fellows
did
miss
coffee
as
much
as
a
kentuckian
though
he
heard
never
mind
they
would
pool
the
coffee
the
boy
had
some
preserved
fruit
that
he
seemed
inclined
to
be
a
hog
about
oh
look
here
i
have
touched
it
just
what
i
sayin
hoardin
that
fruit
it
was
known
that
mac
had
a
very
dacint
little
of
course
if
any
fellow
was
ill
mac
was
the
man
to
refuse
him
a
little
cold
pizen
but
he
must
be
allowed
to
keep
his
own
medicine
chest
and
that
little
pot
o
dundee
marmalade
as
for
he
would
look
after
the
but
mac
was
dead
against
the
whisky
clause
alcohol
had
been
the
curse
of
caribou
and
in
camp
spirits
were
to
be
for
medicinal
purposes
only
whereon
a
cloud
descended
on
and
his
health
began
to
suffer
but
the
precious
was
put
away
in
stock
along
with
the
single
bottles
belonging
to
the
others
mac
had
taken
an
inventory
and
no
one
in
those
early
days
dared
touch
anything
without
his
permission
they
had
cut
into
the
for
a
level
foundation
and
were
hard
at
it
now
hauling
logs
i
wonder
said
the
boy
stopping
a
moment
in
his
work
and
looking
at
the
bleak
prospect
round
him
i
wonder
if
we
going
to
see
anybody
all
winter
oh
sure
to
mac
thought
indians
anyhow
well
i
begin
to
wish
they
mosy
along
said
potts
and
the
sociable
backed
him
up
it
was
towards
noon
on
the
sixth
day
after
landing
they
had
come
to
speak
of
this
now
as
a
voluntary
affair
when
they
were
electrified
by
hearing
strange
voices
looked
up
from
their
work
and
saw
two
white
men
seated
on
a
big
cake
of
ice
going
down
the
river
with
the
current
when
they
recovered
sufficiently
from
their
astonishment
at
the
spectacle
they
ran
down
the
hillside
and
proposed
to
help
the
castaways
to
land
not
a
bit
of
it
in
that
place
what
you
take
us
for
not
much
we
going
to
st
michael
they
had
a
small
boat
drawn
up
by
them
on
the
ice
and
one
man
was
dressed
in
magnificent
furs
a
long
sable
overcoat
and
cap
and
wearing
quite
the
air
of
a
north
pole
nabob
got
any
grub
mac
called
out
yes
want
some
oh
no
i
thought
you
you
not
going
to
try
to
live
through
the
winter
yes
lord
you
in
a
fix
that
we
thought
about
you
but
the
travellers
on
the
went
by
laughing
and
joking
at
the
men
safe
on
shore
with
their
tents
and
provisions
it
made
some
of
them
visibly
uneasy
they
win
through
were
they
crazy
to
try
it
they
had
looked
forward
eagerly
to
the
first
encounter
with
their
kind
but
this
vision
floating
by
on
the
treacherous
ice
of
men
who
rather
dared
the
current
and
the
crash
of
contending
floes
than
land
where
were
seemed
of
evil
augury
the
little
incident
left
a
curiously
sinister
impression
on
the
camp
even
mac
was
found
agreeing
with
the
others
of
his
trio
that
since
they
had
a
grand
tough
time
in
front
of
them
it
was
advisable
to
get
through
the
black
months
ahead
with
as
little
wear
and
tear
as
possible
in
spite
of
the
trio
superior
talents
they
built
a
small
ramshackle
cabin
with
a
fireplace
which
served
them
so
ill
that
they
ultimately
spent
all
their
waking
hours
in
the
more
comfortable
quarters
of
the
colonel
and
the
boy
it
had
been
agreed
that
these
two
with
the
help
or
at
all
events
the
advice
of
the
others
should
build
the
bigger
better
cabin
where
the
stores
should
be
kept
and
the
whole
party
should
mess
a
cabin
with
a
solid
outside
chimney
of
stone
and
an
open
fireplace
generous
of
proportion
and
ancient
of
design
just
like
down
south
the
weather
was
growing
steadily
colder
the
ice
was
solid
now
many
feet
out
from
each
bank
of
the
river
in
the
middle
of
the
flood
the
clotted
current
still
ran
with
but
it
was
plain
the
river
was
settling
down
for
its
long
sleep
not
silently
not
without
stress
and
thunder
the
handful
of
dwellers
on
the
shore
would
be
waked
in
the
night
by
the
shock
and
crash
of
colliding
floes
the
sound
of
the
great
winds
rushing
by
and
hush
what
that
tired
men
would
start
up
out
of
sleep
and
sit
straight
to
listen
down
below
among
the
the
noise
as
of
an
battle
going
on
tumult
and
crashing
and
a
boom
boom
like
cannonading
then
one
morning
they
woke
to
find
all
still
the
conflict
over
the
yukon
frozen
from
bank
to
bank
no
sound
from
that
day
on
no
more
running
water
for
a
good
seven
months
winter
had
come
while
the
work
went
forward
they
often
spoke
of
the
only
two
people
they
had
thus
far
seen
both
potts
and
had
been
heard
to
envy
them
mac
had
happened
to
say
that
he
believed
the
fellow
in
furs
was
an
englishman
a
canadian
at
the
very
least
the
americans
chaffed
him
and
said
that
accounts
for
it
in
a
tone
not
intended
to
flatter
mac
had
thought
of
it
before
but
he
was
prepared
to
swear
now
that
if
an
englishman
they
were
the
hardiest
pioneers
on
earth
or
a
canadian
was
in
favour
of
lighting
out
it
must
be
for
some
good
reason
oh
yes
we
all
know
that
reason
the
americans
laughed
and
mac
growing
hot
was
goaded
into
vaunting
the
britisher
and
running
down
the
yankee
yankee
echoed
the
kentuckian
and
up
in
nova
scotia
they
let
this
man
teach
school
does
know
the
difference
yet
between
the
little
corner
they
call
new
england
and
all
the
rest
of
america
all
the
rest
of
america
shouted
mac
the
cheeky
way
you
people
of
the
states
have
of
gobbling
the
continent
in
just
as
though
the
british
part
of
it
was
the
bigger
half
yes
but
when
you
think
half
you
ought
to
be
obliged
to
any
fellow
for
forgetting
it
and
then
they
referred
to
effete
monarchical
institutions
and
by
the
time
they
reached
the
question
of
the
kind
of
king
the
prince
of
wales
would
make
mac
was
hardly
a
safe
man
to
argue
with
there
was
one
bond
between
him
and
the
kentucky
colonel
they
were
both
religious
men
and
although
mac
was
blue
presbyterian
and
an
inveterate
theologian
somehow
out
here
in
the
wilderness
it
was
more
possible
to
forgive
a
man
for
illusions
about
the
apostolic
succession
and
mistaken
views
upon
church
government
the
colonel
at
all
events
was
not
so
lax
but
what
he
was
ready
to
back
up
the
calvinist
in
an
endeavour
to
keep
the
sabbath
with
a
careful
compromise
between
church
and
chapel
and
help
him
to
conduct
a
but
if
the
boy
attended
the
with
fervour
and
aired
his
heresies
with
uncommon
gusto
if
he
took
with
equal
geniality
colonel
warren
staid
remonstrance
and
mac
fiery
objurgation
sunday
morning
invariably
found
him
more
agnostic
than
ever
stoutly
declining
to
recognise
the
necessity
for
service
for
this
was
an
occasion
when
you
could
argue
or
floor
anybody
or
hope
to
make
mac
hoppin
mad
or
have
the
smallest
kind
of
a
shindy
the
colonel
read
the
lessons
mac
prayed
and
they
all
sang
particularly
now
the
boy
could
sing
a
note
so
there
was
no
fair
division
of
entertainment
wherefore
he
would
go
off
into
the
woods
with
his
gun
for
company
and
the
catholic
and
even
potts
were
in
better
odour
than
he
down
in
camp
on
sundays
so
far
you
may
travel
and
yet
not
escape
the
tyranny
of
the
outworn
creeds
the
boy
came
back
a
full
hour
before
service
on
the
second
sunday
with
a
couple
of
grouse
and
a
beaming
countenance
mac
who
was
cook
that
week
was
the
only
man
left
in
the
tent
he
looked
agreeably
surprised
at
the
apparition
hello
says
he
more
pleasantly
than
his
sunday
gloom
usually
permitted
back
in
time
for
service
i
found
a
native
says
the
boy
speaking
as
proudly
as
any
columbus
he
hurt
his
foot
and
he
only
got
one
eye
but
splendid
told
me
no
end
of
things
he
coming
here
as
fast
as
his
foot
will
let
him
he
and
three
other
indians
esquimaux
i
mean
they
have
had
anything
to
eat
but
berries
and
roots
for
seven
days
the
boy
was
feverishly
overhauling
the
provisions
behind
the
stove
look
here
says
mac
hold
on
there
i
do
know
that
we
come
all
this
way
to
feed
a
lot
o
dirty
savages
but
they
starving
then
seeing
that
that
fact
did
not
produce
the
desired
impression
my
savage
is
an
awfully
good
fellow
he
he
a
converted
savage
seems
to
be
quite
a
christian
then
hastily
following
up
his
advantage
he
been
taught
english
by
the
jesuits
at
the
mission
forty
miles
above
us
on
the
river
he
can
give
us
a
whole
heap
o
tips
mac
was
slowly
bringing
out
a
small
panful
of
cold
boiled
beans
there
are
four
of
them
said
the
boy
big
fellows
almost
as
big
as
our
colonel
and
hungry
mac
looked
at
the
handful
of
beans
and
then
at
the
small
stove
there
are
more
cooking
says
he
not
the
one
that
talks
good
english
is
the
son
of
the
chief
you
can
see
he
different
from
the
others
knows
a
frightful
lot
he
taught
me
some
of
his
language
already
the
men
with
him
said
to
everything
i
asked
and
that
means
savvy
says
he
teach
me
he
teach
all
of
us
how
to
we
know
how
to
oh
i
mean
on
those
long
narrow
that
make
you
go
so
fast
you
always
trip
up
he
show
us
how
to
steer
with
a
pole
and
how
to
make
and
and
everything
mac
began
measuring
out
some
tea
he
got
a
team
of
esquimaux
dogs
calls
mahlemeuts
and
he
got
a
canoe
and
a
skin
kyak
from
the
coast
then
with
an
inspiration
his
people
are
the
sort
of
royal
family
down
there
added
the
boy
thinking
to
appeal
to
the
britisher
monarchical
instincts
mac
had
meditatively
laid
his
hand
on
a
side
of
bacon
the
boy
eyes
following
he
asked
us
of
us
and
we
five
up
to
visit
him
at
pymeut
the
first
village
above
us
here
mac
took
up
a
knife
to
cut
the
bacon
and
good
gracious
why
i
forgot
the
grouse
they
can
have
the
grouse
no
they
ca
said
mac
firmly
they
lucky
to
get
bacon
the
boy
face
darkened
ominously
when
he
looked
like
that
the
elder
men
found
it
was
healthiest
to
give
him
his
head
but
the
young
face
cleared
as
quickly
as
it
had
clouded
after
all
the
point
was
worth
fighting
for
since
grouse
would
take
time
to
cook
and
here
were
the
natives
coming
painfully
along
the
shore
the
boy
ran
out
and
shouted
and
waved
his
cap
the
other
men
of
the
camp
who
had
gone
in
the
opposite
direction
across
the
river
ice
to
look
at
an
came
hurrying
back
and
reached
camp
about
the
same
time
as
the
visitors
thought
you
said
they
were
big
fellows
commented
mac
who
had
come
to
the
door
for
a
glimpse
of
the
indians
as
they
toiled
up
the
slope
well
so
they
are
why
the
colonel
would
make
two
of
any
one
of
them
the
colonel
oh
well
you
ca
expect
anybody
else
to
be
quite
as
big
as
that
i
was
in
a
hurry
but
i
suppose
what
i
meant
was
they
could
eat
as
much
as
the
colonel
how
do
you
know
well
just
look
how
broad
they
are
it
does
matter
to
your
stomach
whether
you
big
up
and
down
or
big
to
and
fro
it
their
furs
make
look
like
that
they
the
most
awful
little
runts
i
ever
saw
well
i
reckon
think
they
were
big
too
big
as
nova
scotia
if
found
come
on
suddenly
like
that
in
the
woods
which
is
the
oh
the
son
of
the
chief
is
in
the
middle
the
one
who
is
taking
off
his
civilised
he
says
his
father
got
a
heap
of
pelts
you
could
get
things
for
your
collection
mac
and
he
got
two
shirts
with
hoods
you
know
like
the
others
are
wearing
they
were
quite
near
now
how
do
said
the
foremost
native
affably
how
do
the
boy
came
forward
and
shook
hands
as
though
he
had
seen
him
for
a
month
this
says
he
turning
first
to
mac
and
then
to
the
other
white
men
this
is
prince
nicholas
of
pymeut
walk
right
in
all
of
you
and
have
something
to
eat
the
visitors
sat
on
the
ground
round
the
stove
as
close
as
they
could
get
without
scorching
and
the
atmosphere
was
quickly
heavy
with
their
presence
when
they
slipped
back
their
hoods
it
was
seen
that
two
of
the
men
wore
the
tartar
tonsure
after
the
fashion
of
the
coast
where
do
you
come
from
inquired
the
colonel
of
the
man
nearest
him
who
simply
blinked
and
was
dumb
this
is
the
one
that
talks
english
said
the
boy
indicating
nicholas
and
he
lives
at
pymeut
and
he
been
converted
how
far
is
pymeut
we
sleep
pymeut
says
nicholas
which
way
the
native
jerked
his
head
up
the
river
many
people
there
he
nodded
white
men
too
he
shook
his
head
how
far
to
the
nearest
white
men
nicholas
mind
wandered
from
the
white
man
catechism
and
fixed
itself
on
his
race
immemorial
problem
how
far
it
was
to
the
nearest
thing
to
eat
i
thought
you
said
he
could
speak
english
so
he
can
first
rate
he
and
i
had
a
great
did
we
nicholas
nicholas
smiled
absently
and
fixed
his
one
eye
on
the
bacon
that
mac
was
cutting
on
the
deal
box
into
such
delicate
slices
he
talk
all
right
said
the
boy
when
he
had
some
breakfast
mac
had
finished
the
cutting
and
now
put
the
on
an
open
hole
in
the
little
stove
cook
him
inquired
nicholas
yes
do
you
cook
him
take
heap
time
cook
him
you
could
eat
it
raw
nicholas
nodded
emphatically
mac
said
no
but
the
boy
was
curious
to
see
if
they
would
really
eat
it
uncooked
let
them
have
of
it
raw
while
the
rest
is
frying
and
he
beckoned
the
visitors
to
the
deal
box
they
made
a
dart
forward
gathered
up
the
fat
bacon
several
slices
at
a
time
and
pushed
it
into
their
mouths
ugh
said
the
colonel
under
his
breath
mac
quickly
swept
what
was
left
into
the
and
began
to
cut
a
fresh
lot
the
boy
divided
the
cold
beans
got
out
biscuits
and
poured
the
tea
while
silence
and
a
strong
smell
of
ancient
fish
and
rancid
seal
pervaded
the
little
tent
put
a
question
or
two
but
nicholas
had
gone
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
they
had
been
starving
after
a
good
feed
they
sat
stolidly
by
the
fire
with
no
sign
of
consciousness
save
the
blinking
of
beady
eyes
till
the
colonel
suggested
a
smoke
then
they
all
grinned
broadly
and
nodded
with
great
vigour
even
those
who
had
no
other
english
understood
tobacco
when
he
had
puffed
awhile
nicholas
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
looking
at
the
boy
said

an
awful
distance
from

three
hundred
and
twenty
miles
said
the
pilot
proud
of
his
general
information
and
quite
ready
since
he
had
got
a
pipe
between
his
teeth
to
be
friendly
and
communicative
what

three
times

village
and
he
lowered
his
voice
not
with
any
hit
of
reverence
or
awe
but
with
an
air
of
making
a
sly
and
cheerful
confidence
and
when
man
die
you
make
a
feast
and
have
a
dance
when
a
friend
dies
if
no
priests
priests
no
like
priests
say
no
dead
man
gone
up
nicholas
pondered
the
strange
saying
and
slowly
shook
his
head
in
that
the
priests
are
right
said
mac
grudgingly
it
was
anything
but
politic
but
for
the
life
of
him
the
boy
help
chipping
in
you
think
when
man
dead
he
stay
dead
eh
and
you
might
as
well
make
a
feast
nicholas
gave
his
quick
nod
we

cold
we
hungry
we
here
heap
long
time
dead
man
he
done
why
no
big
feast
oh
yes
heap
big
feast
the
boy
was
enraptured
he
would
gladly
have
encouraged
these
pagan
deliverances
on
the
part
of
the
converted
prince
but
the
colonel
was
scandalised
and
mac
although
in
his
heart
of
hearts
not
at
the
evidence
of
the
christianity
of
a
man
delivered
over
to
the
corrupt
teaching
of
the
jesuits
found
in
this
last
fact
all
the
stronger
reason
for
the
instant
organisation
of
a
good
protestant
nicholas
of
pymeut
must
not
be
allowed
to
think
it
was
only
jesuits
who
remembered
the
sabbath
day
to
keep
it
holy
and
the
three
pore
benighted
heathen
along
with
him
if
they
understand
english
words
they
should
have
an
and
mac
would
himself
pray
the
prayers
they
could
utter
for
themselves
he
jumped
up
motioned
the
boy
to
put
on
more
wood
cleared
away
the
dishes
filled
the
and
set
it
back
to
simmer
while
the
colonel
got
out
mac
bible
and
his
own
the
boy
did
his
stoking
gloomily
reading
aright
these
portents
almost
eclipsed
was
joy
in
this
find
of
his
for
he
regarded
the
precious
nicholas
as
his
own
special
property
it
was
all
going
to
end
in
his
the
boy
being
hooked
in
for
service
as
long
as
the
esquimaux
were
there
could
of
course
tear
himself
away
and
here
was
the
chance
they
all
been
waiting
for
here
was
a
native
of
knowledge
of
the
natural
law
and
the
immemorial
gospel
of
the
north
who
would
be
gone
soon
oh
very
soon
if
mac
and
the
colonel
went
on
like
this
and
they
were
going
to
choke
off
nicholas
communicativeness
with
a
service
it
sunday
you
know
says
the
colonel
to
the
prince
laying
open
his
book
and
we
were
just
going
to
have
church
you
are
accustomed
to
going
to
church
at
holy
cross
are
you
when
me
kid
me
go
church
you
have
gone
since
you
grew
up
they
still
have
church
there
do
they
oh
father
brachet
him
have
church
why
do
you
go
nicholas
was
vaguely
conscious
of
threatened
disapproval
me
me
must
take
up
ca
you
do
that
another
day
it
seemed
not
to
have
occurred
to
nicholas
before
he
sat
and
considered
the
matter
is
father
brachet
began
the
colonel
gravely
he
does
like
it
does
he
when
you
do
come
to
church
he
take
care
him
church
him
know
me
take
care
me
but
nicholas
saw
plainly
out
of
his
one
eye
that
he
was
not
growing
in
popularity
suddenly
that
solitary
organ
gleamed
with
me
bring
fish
to
father
brachet
and
to
mother
aloysius
and
the
sisters
mac
and
the
colonel
exchanged
dark
glances
do
mother
aloysius
and
the
sisters
live
where
father
brachet
does
father
brachet
and
father
wills
and
brother
paul
and
brother
etienne
all
here
the
native
put
two
fingers
on
the
floor
big
white
cross
in
middle
he
laid
down
his
pipe
to
personate
the
cross
here
indicating
the
other
side
here
mother
aloysius
and
the
sisters
i
thought
says
mac
we
be
hearing
of
a
convent
convenient
me
help
father
brachet
observed
nicholas
proudly
me
show
him
boys
how
make
traps
show
him
girls
how
make
mucklucks
gasps
the
horrified
mac
father
brachet
has
got
a
family
famly
inquired
nicholas
kaiomi
and
he
shook
his
head
uncertainly
you
say
father
brachet
has
got
boys
and
as
though
this
were
a
yet
deeper
brand
of
iniquity
nicholas
though
greatly
mystified
nodded
firmly
i
suppose
he
thinks
away
off
up
here
nobody
will
ever
know
oh
these
jesuits
how
many
children
has
this
shameless
priest
father
brachet
him
got
seventeen
boys
and
me
no
savvy
how
much
girl
twelve
girl
twenty
girl
the
boy
who
had
been
splitting
with
inward
laughter
exploded
at
this
juncture
he
keeps
a
native
school
mac
yes
says
nicholas
teach
boy
make
table
chair
potatoes
grow
all
kinds
sisters
teach
girl
make
dinner
wash
all
kinds
heap
good
people
up
at
holy
cross
divil
a
doubt
of
it
says
but
this
blind
belauding
of
the
children
of
loyola
only
fired
mac
the
more
to
give
the
heathen
a
glimpse
of
the
true
light
in
what
darkness
must
they
grope
when
a
sly
intriguing
jesuit
it
was
well
known
they
were
all
like
that
was
for
them
a
type
of
the
heap
good
man
a
priest
forsooth
who
winked
at
because
he
and
his
neighbouring
nuns
shared
in
the
spoil
well
they
must
try
to
have
a
truly
impressive
service
mac
and
the
colonel
telegraphed
agreement
on
this
head
savages
were
said
to
be
specially
touched
by
music
i
suppose
when
you
were
a
kid
the
jesuits
taught
you
chants
and
so
on
said
the
colonel
kindly
kaiomi
answered
nicholas
after
reflection
you
can
sing
ca
you
asks
sing
no
me
dance
the
boy
roared
with
delight
why
yes
i
never
thought
of
that
you
fellows
do
the
songs
and
nicholas
and
i
do
the
dances
mac
glowered
angrily
look
here
if
you
do
mind
being
blasphemous
for
yourself
do
demoralise
the
natives
well
i
like
that
did
miriam
dance
before
the
lord
why
nicholas
and
me
the
colonel
cleared
his
throat
and
began
to
read
the
lessons
for
the
day
the
natives
sat
and
watched
him
closely
they
really
behaved
very
well
and
the
boy
was
enormously
proud
of
his
new
friends
there
was
a
great
deal
at
stake
the
boy
felt
he
must
walk
warily
and
he
already
regretted
those
light
expressions
about
dancing
before
the
lord
all
the
fun
of
the
winter
might
depend
on
a
friendly
relation
between
pymeut
and
the
camp
it
was
essential
that
the
esquimaux
should
not
only
receive
but
make
a
good
impression
the
singing
from
greenland
icy
mountains
to
india
coral
strand
seemed
to
please
them
but
when
after
the
colonel
here
endeth
the
second
lesson
mac
said
in
sepulchral
tones
let
us
pray
the
visitors
seemed
to
think
it
was
time
to
go
home
no
said
mac
sternly
they
must
go
in
the
middle
of
the
meeting
and
he
proceeded
to
kneel
down
but
nicholas
was
putting
on
his
fur
coat
and
the
others
only
waited
to
follow
him
out
the
boy
greatly
concerned
lest
after
all
the
visit
should
end
badly
dropped
on
his
knees
to
add
the
force
of
his
own
example
and
through
the
opening
phrases
of
mac
prayer
the
agnostic
was
heard
saying
in
a
loud
do
like
me
down
look
here
suppose
you
ask
us
come
big
feast
and
in
the
middle
of
your
dance
we
all
go
home
oh
no
remonstrated
nicholas
very
well
these
friends
o
mine
no
like
man
go
home
in
the
middle
they
heap
mad
at
me
when
i
no
stay
you
savvy
me
savvy
says
nicholas
slowly
and
rather
depressed
kneel
down
then
says
the
boy
and
first
nicholas
and
then
the
others
went
on
their
knees
alternately
they
looked
in
the
boy
corner
where
the
grub
was
and
then
over
their
shoulders
at
the
droning
mac
and
back
catching
the
boy
eye
and
returning
his
reassuring
nods
and
grins
mac
who
had
had
no
innings
up
to
this
point
was
now
embarked
upon
a
most
congenial
occupation
wrestling
with
the
lord
on
behalf
of
the
heathen
he
lost
count
of
time
on
and
on
the
prayer
wound
its
slow
way
involution
after
involution
coil
after
coil
like
a
snake
the
boy
thought
lazing
in
the
sun
unaccustomed
knees
grew
sore
hearken
to
the
cry
of
them
that
walk
in
darkness
misled
by
wolves
in
sheep
clothing
lord
wearing
the
sign
of
the
holy
cross
shuffled
and
mac
pulled
himself
up
no
light
task
this
of
conveying
to
the
creator
in
covert
terms
a
due
sense
of
the
iniquity
of
the
jesuits
without
at
the
same
time
stirring
bile
and
seeing
him
get
up
and
stalk
out
of
meeting
as
had
happened
once
before
was
not
deeply
concerned
about
religious
questions
but
there
were
limits
the
problem
was
how
to
rouse
the
lord
without
rousing
a
piece
of
negotiation
so
delicate
calling
for
a
skill
in
pious
invective
so
infinitely
absorbing
to
mac
particular
cast
of
mind
that
he
was
quickly
and
deaf
to
all
things
else
not
all
the
heathen
are
sunk
in
iniquity
but
they
are
weak
tempted
and
they
weary
lord
amen
said
the
boy
discreetly
how
long
groaned
mac
oh
lord
how
long
but
it
was
much
longer
than
he
realised
the
boy
saw
the
visitors
shifting
from
one
knee
to
another
and
feared
the
worst
but
he
sympathised
deeply
with
their
predicament
to
ease
his
own
legs
he
changed
his
position
and
dragged
a
corner
of
the
sailcloth
down
off
the
little
pile
of
provisions
and
doubled
it
under
his
knees
the
movement
revealed
the
bag
of
dried
apples
within
arm
length
nicholas
was
surreptitiously
reaching
for
his
coat
no
doubt
about
it
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
the
fitting
moment
to
depart
a
look
over
his
shoulder
showed
mac
absorbed
and
taking
fresh
breath
at
sixthly
oh
lord
the
boy
put
out
a
hand
and
dragged
the
slowly
softly
towards
him
the
prince
dropped
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
and
fixed
his
one
eye
on
his
friend
the
boy
undid
the
neck
of
the
sack
thrust
in
his
hand
and
brought
out
a
fistfull
another
look
at
mac
still
hard
at
it
trying
to
spare
feelings
without
mincing
matters
with
the
almighty
the
boy
winked
at
nicholas
made
a
gesture
catch
and
fired
a
bit
of
dried
apple
at
him
at
the
same
time
putting
a
piece
in
his
own
mouth
to
show
him
it
was
all
right
nicholas
followed
suit
and
seemed
pleased
with
the
result
he
showed
all
his
strong
white
teeth
and
ecstatically
winked
his
one
eye
back
at
the
boy
who
threw
him
another
bit
and
then
a
piece
to
each
of
the
others
the
colonel
had
caught
on
and
was
making
horrible
frowns
at
the
boy
potts
and
looked
up
and
in
dumbshow
demanded
a
share
no
very
well
they
tell
mac
so
the
boy
had
to
feed
them
too
to
keep
them
quiet
and
still
mac
prayed
the
lord
to
catch
up
this
slip
he
had
made
here
on
the
yukon
with
reference
to
the
natives
in
the
midst
of
a
powerful
peroration
he
happened
to
open
his
eyes
a
little
and
they
fell
on
the
magnificent
great
sable
collar
of
prince
nicholas
coat
without
any
of
the
usual
slowing
down
without
the
accustomed
warning
of
a
gradual
descent
from
the
high
themes
of
heaven
to
the
things
of
common
earth
mac
came
down
out
of
the
clouds
with
a
bump
and
the
sudden
amen
startled
all
the
congregation
mac
stood
up
and
says
he
to
nicholas
where
did
you
get
that
coat
nicholas
still
on
his
knees
stared
and
seemed
in
doubt
if
this
were
a
part
of
the
service
where
did
you
get
that
coat
repeated
mac
the
boy
had
jumped
up
nimbly
i
told
you

father
has
a
lot
of
furs
like
this

nicholas

the
other
white
man

nicholas
shrugged
kaiomi
though
it
was
plain
he
knew
well
enough
the
other

under
the
yukon
ice
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
fellows
who
went

jeering
at
us

not
crow

said
mac
and
they
bade
prince
nicholas
and
his
heathen
retinue
in
a
mood
chastened
not
by
prayer
alone
chapter
ii
there
is
a
sort
of
moral
climate
in
a
household
john
morley
no
idle
ceremony
this
but
the
great
problem
of
the
dwellers
in
the
country
of
the
yukon
the
colonel
and
the
boy
made
up
their
minds
that
whatever
else
they
had
or
had
not
they
would
have
a
warm
house
to
live
in
and
when
they
had
got
it
they
would
have
a
to
celebrate
the
achievement
we
invite
nicholas
says
the
boy
i
go
to
pymeut
myself
and
let
him
know
we
are
going
to
have
fire
big
feed
oh
heap
big
time
if
the
truth
were
told
it
had
been
a
difficult
enough
matter
to
keep
away
from
pymeut
since
the
hour
nicholas
had
vanished
in
that
direction
but
until
winter
quarters
were
made
and
until
they
were
proved
to
be
warm
there
was
no
time
for
the
amenities
of
life
the
big
cabin
as
it
was
quite
seriously
called
in
contradistinction
to
the
hut
of
the
trio
consisted
of
a
single
room
measuring
on
the
outside
sixteen
feet
by
eighteen
feet
the
walls
of
logs
soared
upward
to
a
level
of
six
feet
and
this
height
was
magnificently
increased
in
the
middle
by
the
angle
of
the
mildly
gable
roof
but
before
the
cabin
was
the
boy
had
begun
to
long
for
a
window
sorry
we
forgot
the
says
mac
wud
ye
like
a
asks
what
the
use
of
goin
all
the
way
from
nova
scotia
to
caribou
says
the
boy
to
the
if
you
have
learned
the
way
to
make
a
window
like
the
indians
out
of
transparent
skin
mac
assumed
an
air
of
elevated
contempt
i
went
to
mine
not
to
learn
indian
tricks
when
the
door
shut
it
be
dark
as
the
inside
of
a
you
ought
to
have
thought
of
that
before
you
left
the
sunny
south
said
potts
it
be
dark
all
winter
window
or
no
window
mac
reminded
them
never
mind
said
the
colonel
when
the
candles
give
out
we
have
the
keep
all
the
spruce
knots
boys
but
one
of
the
boys
was
not
pleased
the
next
day
looking
for
a
under
the
tarpaulin
he
came
across
the
wooden
box
a
california
friend
had
given
him
at
parting
containing
a
dozen
tall
glass
jars
of
preserved
fruit
the
others
had
growled
at
the
extra
bulk
and
weight
when
the
boy
put
the
box
into
the
boat
at
michael
but
they
had
now
begun
to
look
kindly
on
it
and
ask
when
it
was
to
be
opened
he
had
answered
firmly
not
before
christmas
modifying
this
since
nicholas
visit
to
not
before
the
but
one
morning
the
boy
was
found
pouring
the
fruit
out
of
the
jars
into
some
empty
cans
what
you
up
to
wait
an
see
he
went
to
who
was
that
week
got
him
to
melt
a
couple
of
buckets
of
snow
over
the
campfire
and
wash
the
clean
now
colonel
says
the
boy
bring
along
that
o
yours
and
lend
a
hand
they
took
off
the
top
log
from
the
south
wall
of
the
cabin
measured
a
space
in
the
middle
and
the
colonel
sawed
out
the
superfluous
spruce
intervening
while
he
went
on
doing
the
same
for
the
other
logs
on
that
side
the
boy
roughly
chiselled
a
moderately
flat
sill
then
one
after
another
he
set
up
six
of
the
tall
glass
jars
in
a
row
and
showed
how
alternating
with
the
other
six
bottles
turned
upside
down
the
thick
belly
of
one
accommodating
itself
to
the
thin
neck
of
the
other
the
twelve
made
a
very
decent
rectangle
of
glass
when
they
had
hoisted
up
and
fixed
in
place
the
logs
on
each
side
and
the
big
fellow
that
went
all
across
on
top
when
they
had
filled
the
inconsiderable
cracks
between
the
bottles
with
some
of
the
with
which
the
logs
were
to
be
chinked
behold
a
double
glass
window
fit
for
a
king
the
boy
was
immensely
pleased
oh
that
an
old
dodge
said
mac
depreciatingly
why
they
did
that
at
caribou
then
why
in
why
did
you
suggest
it
you
wait
till
you
know
more
about
this
kind
o
life
and
you
wo
go
in
for
fancy
touches
nevertheless
the
man
who
had
mined
at
caribou
seemed
to
feel
that
some
contribution
from
him
was
necessary
to
offset
the
huge
success
of
that
window
he
did
not
feel
called
upon
to
help
to
split
logs
for
the
roof
of
the
big
cabin
but
he
sat
cutting
and
whittling
away
at
a
little
shelf
which
he
said
was
to
be
nailed
up
at
the
right
of
the
big
cabin
door
its
use
was
not
apparent
but
no
one
dared
call
it
a
fancy
touch
for
mac
was
a
miner
and
had
been
to
caribou
when
the
shelf
was
nailed
up
its
maker
brought
forth
out
of
his
a
bottle
of
perry
davis
now
at
caribou
says
he
they
have
got
any
more
thermometers
kicking
round
than
we
have
here
but
they
discovered
that
when
perry
davis
congeals
you
must
keep
a
sharp
for
and
when
perry
davis
freezes
solid
you
better
mind
your
eye
and
stay
in
your
cabin
if
you
do
want
to
die
on
the
trail
with
which
he
tied
a
string
round
perry
davis
neck
set
the
bottle
up
on
the
shelf
and
secured
it
firmly
in
place
they
all
agreed
it
was
a
grand
advantage
to
have
been
to
caribou
but
mac
knew
things
that
he
had
probably
not
learned
there
about
trees
and
rocks
and
beasts
and
their
manners
and
customs
and
family
names
if
there
were
more
than
a
in
the
significant
lament
of
a
very
different
man
i
should
be
a
poet
if
only
i
knew
the
names
of
things
then
indeed
samuel
maccann
was
equipped
to
make
a
mark
in
literature
from
the
time
he
set
foot
on
the
volcanic
shore
of
st
michael
island
mac
had
begun
his
collection
nowadays
when
he
would
spend
over
that
truck
of
his
hours
that
might
profitably
considering
his
talents
be
employed
in
helping
to
fortify
the
camp
against
the
arctic
winter
his
companions
felt
it
little
use
to
remonstrate
by
themselves
they
got
on
rapidly
with
work
on
the
roof
very
much
helped
by
three
days
unexpectedly
mild
weather
when
the
split
logs
had
been
marshalled
together
on
each
side
of
the
comb
they
covered
them
with
dried
moss
and
spruce
boughs
over
all
they
laid
a
thick
blanket
of
the
earth
which
had
been
dug
out
to
make
a
level
foundation
the
cracks
in
the
walls
were
chinked
with
moss
and
the
floor
was
the
naked
ground
to
be
carpeted
with
skins
so
mac
said
but
nobody
believed
mac
would
put
a
skin
to
any
such
sensible
use
the
unreasonable
mildness
of
three
or
four
days
and
the
little
surface
thaw
came
to
an
abrupt
end
in
a
cold
rain
that
turned
to
sleet
as
it
fell
nobody
felt
like
going
far
afield
just
then
even
after
game
but
they
had
set
the
snare
that
nicholas
told
the
boy
about
on
that
first
encounter
in
the
wood
nicholas
it
seemed
had
given
him
a
noose
made
of
twisted
sinew
and
showed
how
it
worked
in
a
running
loop
he
had
illustrated
the
virtue
of
this
noose
when
attached
to
a
pole
balanced
in
the
crotch
of
a
tree
caught
over
a
horizontal
stick
by
means
of
a
small
wooden
pin
tied
to
the
snare
a
touch
at
the
light
end
of
the
suspended
pole
where
the
baited
loop
dangles
loosens
the
pin
and
the
heavy
end
of
the
pole
falls
hanging
ptarmigan
or
partridge
in
the
air
for
some
time
after
rigging
this
contrivance
whenever
anyone
reported
tracks
mac
and
the
boy
would
hasten
to
the
scene
of
action
and
set
a
new
snare
piling
brush
on
each
side
of
the
track
that
the
game
had
run
in
so
barring
other
ways
and
presenting
a
line
of
least
resistance
straight
through
the
loop
in
the
early
days
mac
would
come
away
from
these
preparations
saying
with
dry
pleasure
now
with
luck
we
may
get
a
or
some
such
fearful
wildfowl
good
to
eat
the
boy
would
ask
having
had
his
disappointments
ere
now
in
moments
of
hunger
for
fresh
meat
when
mac
with
the
nearest
approach
to
enthusiasm
he
permitted
himself
had
brought
in
some
miserable
little
or
a
woodpecker
to
add
not
to
the
larder
but
to
the
collection
no
you
do
sabine
gulls
mac
would
answer
pityingly
but
those
snares
never
seemed
to
know
what
they
were
there
for
the
first
one
was
set
expressly
to
catch
one
of
the
commonest
birds
that
fly
mac
the
beautiful
white
arctic
grouse
or
at
the
very
least
a
which
being
interpreted
is
ruffed
ptarmigan
the
tracks
had
been
bird
tracks
but
the
creature
that
swung
in
the
air
next
day
was
a
baby
hare
the
schoolmaster
looked
upon
the
incident
as
being
in
the
nature
of
a
practical
joke
and
resented
it
but
the
others
were
enchanted
and
professed
thereafter
a
rooted
suspicion
of
the
soundness
of
the
schoolmaster
natural
history
which
nobody
actually
felt
for
he
had
never
yet
pretended
to
know
anything
that
he
did
know
well
and
when
potts
would
say
something
disparaging
of
mac
learning
behind
his
back
which
was
against
the
unwritten
rules
of
the
game
the
colonel
invariably
sat
on
potts
knows
a
darned
sight
too
much
no
he
sir
that
just
the
remarkable
thing
about
mac
he
is
trying
to
carry
any
more
than
he
can
swing
at
the
same
time
it
is
to
be
feared
that
none
of
his
companions
really
appreciated
the
pedagogue
learning
nor
had
anyone
but
the
boy
sympathised
with
his
resolution
to
make
a
collection
what
they
wanted
was
eatable
game
and
they
affected
no
intelligent
interest
in
knowing
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
particular
species
that
was
sending
up
appetising
odours
from
the
pot
they
even
applauded
the
rudeness
of
the
boy
who
one
day
responded
to
mac
gravely
jubilant
look
here
i
got
the
poor
old
man
what
do
you
do
for
it
and
when
anybody
after
that
was
indisposed
they
said
he
might
be
sickening
for
an
attack
of
parus
hudsonicus
and
in
that
case
it
was
a
bad
well
for
mac
that
he
would
have
cared
a
red
cent
to
impress
the
greatest
naturalist
alive
let
alone
a
lot
of
fellows
who
did
know
a
titmouse
from
a
disease
meanwhile
work
on
the
big
cabin
had
gone
steadily
forward
from
the
outside
it
looked
finished
now
and
distinctly
imposing
from
what
were
left
of
the
precious
planks
out
of
the
bottom
of
the
best
boat
they
had
made
the
door
two
by
four
and
opening
directly
in
front
of
that
masterpiece
the
rock
fireplace
the
great
stone
chimney
was
the
pride
of
the
camp
and
the
talk
before
the
winter
was
done
of
all
the
lower
river
spurred
on
partly
by
the
increased
intensity
of
the
cold
partly
by
the
colonel
nonsense
about
the
way
they
did
it
down
south
mac
roused
himself
and
turned
out
a
better
piece
of
masonry
for
the
big
cabin
than
he
had
thought
necessary
for
his
own
but
everybody
had
a
share
in
the
glory
of
that
fireplace
the
colonel
potts
and
the
boy
selected
the
stone
and
brought
it
on
a
rude
litter
out
of
a
natural
quarry
from
a
place
a
mile
or
more
away
up
on
the
bare
mixed
and
handed
up
the
while
mac
put
in
some
brisk
work
with
it
before
it
stiffened
in
the
increasing
cold
everybody
was
looking
forward
to
getting
out
of
the
tent
and
into
the
warm
cabin
and
the
building
of
the
fireplace
stirred
enthusiasm
it
was
two
and
a
half
feet
deep
three
and
a
half
feet
high
and
four
feet
wide
and
when
furnished
with
hack
logs
packed
in
glowing
ashes
and
laid
one
above
another
with
a
roaring
good
blaze
in
front
of
birch
and
spruce
that
fire
would
take
a
lot
of
beating
as
the
boy
admitted
even
in
the
florida
country
but
no
fire
on
earth
could
prevent
the
cabin
from
being
swept
through
the
moment
the
door
was
opened
by
a
fierce
and
icy
the
late
autumnal
gales
revealed
the
fact
that
the
sole
means
of
ventilation
had
been
so
nicely
contrived
that
whoever
came
in
or
went
out
admitted
a
hurricane
of
draught
that
nearly
knocked
him
down
potts
said
it
took
a
good
after
anyone
had
opened
the
door
to
heat
the
place
up
again
what
you
cold
inquired
the
usual
culprit
the
boy
had
come
in
to
put
an
edge
on
his
chopper
it
stopped
snowin
an
you
better
come
along
with
me
potts
swing
an
axe
for
a
couple
of
hours
that
warm
you
i
got
rheumatism
in
my
shoulder
says
potts
hugging
the
huge
fire
closer
and
you
got
something
wrong
with
your
eyes
eh
mac
potts
narrowed
his
and
widened
the
great
mouth
but
he
had
turned
his
head
so
mac
could
see
him
the
nova
scotian
only
growled
and
refilled
his
pipe
up
in
the
woods
the
boy
repeated
the
conversation
to
the
colonel
who
looked
across
at
several
yards
away
and
said
hush
why
must
i
shut
up
mac
do
look
rather
queer
and
bloodshot
i
should
think
he
rather
feel
we
lay
it
to
his
eyes
than
know
afraid
he
peterin
out
altogether
i
never
said
i
was
afraid
no
you
have
much
i
have
opened
my
head
about
it
no
but
you
tried
hard
enough
for
five
or
six
days
to
get
mac
to
the
point
where
he
would
come
out
and
show
us
how
to
you
have
anything
but
you
you
got
pretty
dignified
each
time
you
failed
and
we
all
know
what
that
means
we
ought
to
have
begun
sawing
boards
for
our
bunks
and
a
week
back
before
this
heavy
snowfall
besides
there
enough
now
we
only
marking
time
until
until
mac
eyes
get
all
right
i
understand
again
the
colonel
had
made
a
sound
like
sh
and
went
on
swinging
his
axe
they
worked
without
words
till
the
boy
tree
came
down
then
he
stopped
a
moment
and
wiped
his
face
it
is
so
cold
not
by
a
long
shot
for
all
potts
howling
about
his
rheumatics
it
is
cold
that
starts
that
kind
of
pain
no
siree
i
not
much
of
a
doctor
but
i
can
see
potts
rheumatism
does
depend
on
the
weather
never
you
mind
potts
i
do
mind
potts
i
only
mind
mac
what
the
matter
with
mac
anyway
oh
he
just
got
cold
feet
maybe
he
thaw
out
did
you
ever
think
what
mac
like
with
that
jaw
and
nose
everything
about
him
goin
like
this
the
boy
described
a
few
quick
blunt
angles
in
the
air
well
sir
he
the
livin
image
of
a
i
comin
to
think
he
as
much
like
it
inside
as
he
is
out
he
can
screw
up
for
a
or
he
can
screw
down
for
business
when
he
a
mind
but
as
jimmie
over
there
says
divil
a
different
pace
can
you
put
him
through
i
i
only
sayin
they
are
as
limber
as
no
response
from
the
colonel
who
was
making
the
chips
fly
it
had
cost
his
great
body
a
good
many
aches
and
bruises
but
he
was
a
capital
axeman
now
and
not
such
a
bad
carpenter
though
when
the
boy
said
as
much
he
had
answered
carpenter
i
just
a
sort
of
a
and
deeply
he
regretted
that
in
all
his
young
years
on
a
big
place
in
the
country
he
had
learnt
so
little
about
anything
but
horses
and
cattle
on
the
way
back
to
dinner
they
spoke
again
of
this
difficulty
of
the
boards
whistled
rory
with
his
pleasant
air
of
detachment
you
and
the
others
would
take
more
interest
in
the
subject
said
the
boy
a
little
hotly
if
we
had
let
you
fellows
use
nearly
all
the
for
bunks
and
now
we
have
got
any
for
our
own
us
use
faith
we
had
a
right
to
to
boards
out
of
boat
and
ye
can
have
the
loan
o
the
to
make
more
whenever
the
fancy
takes
ye
loan
o
the
why
it
mine
says
the
colonel
divil
a
bit
of
it
man
says
serenely
everything
we
got
belongs
to
all
of
us
except
a
sack
o
coffee
a
and
a
and
it
mesilf
that
afraid
the
what
the
use
of
my
having
bought
a
interrupted
the
colonel
hurriedly
what
the
good
of
it
if
the
only
man
that
knows
how
to
use
it
is
more
taken
up
wid
bein
a
guardjin
angel
to
his
the
colonel
turned
and
frowned
at
the
proprietor
of
the
the
boy
had
dropped
behind
to
look
at
some
marten
tracks
in
the
snow
i
follow
that
trail
after
dinner
says
he
catching
up
the
others
in
time
to
hear
say
if
it
wus
that
ye
think
only
a
feller
that
been
to
caribou
can
teach
ye
annything
it
jimmie
that
show
ye
how
to
play
a
chune
on
that
same
will
you
show
us
after
dinner
sure
i
will
and
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
this
business
of
turning
a
tree
into
boards
without
the
aid
of
a
is
a
thing
many
have
to
learn
for
even
if
they
are
disposed
to
sleep
on
the
floor
and
to
do
without
shelves
they
ca
do
sluicing
without
and
they
ca
make
those
long
narrow

the

it

and
even

had
the
curiosity
to
come
out
and
see
what
they
were
up
to
mac
was
kind
o
dozin
by
the
fire
when
the
frame
was
finished
helped
to
put
the
in
place
having
marked
it
off
with
charcoal
to
indicate
inch
and
a
quarter
planks
then
the
colonel
down
in
the
pit
and
on
top
of
the
frame
took
the
great
saw
between
them
and
began
laboriously
one
drawing
the
big
blade
up
and
the
other
down
vertically
through
the
log
along
the
charcoal
line
an

been
at

an
hour
ye
find
it
goes
betther
wid
a
little
blasphemin
and
he
gave
his
end
of
the
saw
to
the
reluctant
potts
potts
was
about
this
time
as
much
of
a
problem
to
his
pardners
as
was
the
if
the
bank
clerk
had
surprised
them
all
by
his
handiness
on
board
ship
and
by
making
a
crane
to
swing
the
pots
over
the
fire
he
surprised
them
all
still
more
in
these
days
by
an
apparent
eclipse
of
his
talents
it
was
unaccountable
potts
carpentering
potts
cleverness
was
like
payrock
in
a
pocket
as
the
miners
say
speedily
worked
out
and
not
a
trace
of
it
afterwards
to
be
found
but
less
and
less
was
the
defection
of
the
trio
felt
the
burly
kentucky
was
getting
his
hand
in
at
frontier
work
though
he
still
could
get
on
without
his
nigger
as
the
boy
said
slyly
indicating
that
it
was
he
who
occupied
this
exalted
post
these
two
soon
had
the
bunks
made
out
of
the
rough
planks
they
had
sawed
with
all
a
pains
they
put
in
a
fragrant
mattress
of
spring
moss
and
on
that
made
up
a
bed
of
blankets
and
furs
more
boards
were
laboriously
turned
out
to
make
the
great
to
hang
up
high
in
the
angle
of
the
roof
where
the
provisions
might
be
stored
out
of
reach
of
possible
marauders
the
days
were
very
short
now
bringing
only
about
five
hours
of
pallid
light
so
little
of
which
struggled
through
the
famous
that
at
all
hours
they
depended
chiefly
on
the
blaze
from
the
great
fireplace
there
was
still
a
good
deal
of
work
to
be
done
indoors
shelves
to
be
put
up
on
the
left
as
you
entered
whereon
the
was
kept
a
to
be
made
and
stools
while
these
additions
fancy
touches
as
the
trio
called
them
were
being
made
potts
and
although
occasionally
they
went
out
for
an
hour
or
two
on
shoulder
seldom
brought
home
anything
and
for
the
most
part
were
content
with
doing
what
they
modestly
considered
their
share
of
the
cooking
and
washing
for
the
rest
they
sat
by
the
fire
playing
endless
games
of
euchre
and
bean
poker
while
mac
more
silent
than
ever
smoked
and
read
copps
mining
laws
and
the
magazines
of
the
previous
august
nobody
heard
much
in
those
days
of
caribou
the
colonel
had
gradually
slipped
into
the
position
of
boss
of
the
camp
the
trio
were
still
just
a
trifle
afraid
of
him
and
he
on
his
side
never
pressed
a
dangerous
issue
too
far
but
this
is
a
little
to
anticipate
one
bitter
gray
morning
that
had
reduced
perry
davis
to
a
solid
lump
of
ice
the
colonel
and
the
boy
were
bringing
into
the
cabin
the
last
of
the
boards
the
colonel
halted
and
looked
steadily
up
the
river
is
that
a
beast
or
a
human
said
he
it
a
man
the
boy
decided
after
a
moment
no
two
men
single
file
and
yes
colonel
it
dogs
hooray
a
at
last
they
had
simultaneously
dropped
the
lumber
the
boy
ran
on
to
tell
the
cook
to
prepare
more
grub
and
then
pelted
after
and
the
colonel
who
had
gone
down
to
meet
the
newcomers
an
indian
driving
five
dogs
which
were
hitched
tandem
to
a
low
esquimaux
sled
with
a
pack
and
two
pairs
of
lashed
on
it
and
followed
by
a
white
man
the
indian
was
a
fine
fellow
younger
than
prince
nicholas
and
better
off
in
the
matter
of
eyes
the
white
man
was
a
good
deal
older
than
either
with
grizzled
hair
a
worn
face
bright
dark
eyes
and
a
pleasant
smile
i
had
heard
some
white
men
had
camped
hereabouts
says
he
i
am
glad
to
see
we
have
such
substantial
neighbours
he
was
looking
up
at
the
stone
chimney
conspicuous
a
long
way
off
we
did
know
we
had
any
white
neighbours
said
the
colonel
in
his
most
grand
and
gracious
manner
how
far
away
are
you
sir
about
forty
miles
above
as
he
answered
he
happened
to
be
glancing
at
the
boy
and
observed
his
eagerness
cloud
slightly
had
nicholas
said
it
was
about
forty
miles
above
that
the
missionaries
lived
but
to
be
only
forty
miles
away
the
stranger
went
on
misinterpreting
the
fading
gladness
is
to
be
near
neighbours
in
this
country
we
are
quite
fixed
yet
said
the
colonel
but
you
must
come
in
and
have
some
dinner
with
us
we
can
promise
you
a
good
fire
anyhow
thank
you
you
have
chosen
a
fine
site
and
the
bright
eyes
with
the
deep
raying
out
from
the
corners
scanned
the
country
in
so
keen
and
knowing
a
fashion
that
the
boy
with
hope
reviving
ventured
are
are
you
a
prospector
no
i
am
father
wills
from
holy
cross
oh
and
the
boy
presently
caught
up
with
the
indian
and
walked
on
beside
him
looking
back
every
now
and
then
to
watch
the
dogs
or
examine
the
harness
the
driver
spoke
english
and
answered
questions
with
a
tolerable
intelligence
are
dogs
often
driven
without
reins
the
indian
nodded
the
colonel
after
the
stranger
had
introduced
himself
was
just
a
shade
more
reserved
but
seemed
determined
not
to
be
lacking
in
hospitality
was
overflowing
or
would
have
been
had
the
jesuit
encouraged
him
he
told
their
story
or
more
properly
his
own
and
how
they
had
been
wrecked
and
so
ye
the
father
superior
up
there
says
the
irishman
pausing
to
take
breath
no
our
superior
is
father
brachet
that
a
cabin
the
dogs
halted
though
they
had
at
least
five
hundred
yards
still
to
travel
before
they
would
reach
the
cabin
shouted
the
indian
the
dogs
cleared
the
and
went
spinning
along
so
briskly
over
the
low
hummocks
that
the
driver
had
to
run
to
keep
up
with
them
the
boy
was
flying
after
when
the
priest
having
caught
sight
of
his
face
called
out
here
wait
stop
a
moment
and
hurried
forward
he
kicked
through
the
gathered
up
a
handful
of
snow
and
began
to
rub
it
on
the
boy
right
cheek
what
in
the
name
of
the
boy
was
drawing
back
angrily
keep
still
ordered
the
priest
your
cheek
is
frozen
and
he
applied
more
snow
and
more
friction
you
ought
to
watch
one
another
in
such
weather
as
this
when
a
man
turns
like
that
touched
with
after
he
had
restored
the
circulation
there
now
do
go
near
the
fire
or
it
will
begin
to
hurt
thank
you
said
the
boy
a
little
it
all
right
now
i
suppose
i
think
so
said
the
priest
you
lose
the
skin
and
you
may
be
a
little
sore
nothing
to
speak
of
with
which
he
fell
back
to
the
colonel
side
the
dogs
had
settled
down
into
a
now
but
were
still
well
on
in
front
is
their
food
asked
the
boy
no
fish
why
does
your
indian
go
on
like
that
about
mush
then
oh
that
the
only
word
the
dogs
know
except
a
certain
expressions
we
try
to
discourage
the
indians
from
using
in
the
old
days
the
used
to
say
now
you
never
hear
anything
but
swearing
and
a
corruption
of
the
he
turned
to
the
colonel
you
get
over
trying
to
wear
cheechalko
boots
here
nothing
like
mucklucks
with
a
wisp
of
straw
inside
for
this
country
i
agree
wid
ye
i
got
me
a
pair
in
michael
says
proudly
turning
out
his
enormous
feet
never
wore
anything
so
in
me
life
you
ought
to
have
drill
parkis
too
like
this
of
mine
to
keep
out
the
wind
they
were
going
up
the
slope
now
obliquely
to
the
cabin
close
behind
the
dogs
who
were
pulling
spasmodically
between
their
little
rests
father
wills
stooped
and
gathered
up
some
moss
that
the
wind
had
swept
almost
bare
of
snow
you
see
that
he
said
to
while
the
boy
stopped
and
the
colonel
hurried
on
wherever
you
find
that
growing
no
man
need
starve
the
colonel
looked
back
before
entering
the
cabin
and
saw
that
the
boy
seemed
to
have
forgotten
not
alone
the
indian
but
the
dogs
and
was
walking
behind
with
the
jesuit
face
upturned
smiling
as
friendly
as
you
please
within
a
different
picture
potts
and
mac
were
having
a
row
about
something
and
the
colonel
struck
in
sharply
on
their
growling
comments
upon
each
other
character
and
probable
destination
got
plenty
to
eat
two
hungry
men
coming
in
one
an
indian
and
you
know
what
that
means
and
the
other
a
catholic
priest
it
was
this
bomb
that
he
had
hurried
on
to
get
exploded
and
done
with
before
the
said
priest
should
appear
on
the
scene
a
mac
raised
his
heavy
eyes
with
fight
in
every
wooden
feature
a
jesuit
priest
is
what
i
said
he
wo
eat
his
dinner
here
that
is
exactly
what
he
will
do
not
by
whether
it
was
the
monstrous
proposition
that
had
unstrung
mac
he
was
obliged
to
steady
himself
against
the
table
with
a
shaking
hand
but
he
set
those
square
features
of
his
like
iron
and
says
he
no
jesuit
sits
down
to
the
same
table
with
me
that
means
then
that
you
eat
alone
not
if
i
know
it
the
colonel
slid
in
place
the
heavy
wooden
bar
that
had
never
before
been
requisitioned
to
secure
the
door
and
he
came
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
cabin
where
he
could
let
out
all
his
inches
just
clearing
the
he
pulled
his
great
figure
up
to
its
full
height
and
standing
there
like
a
second
goliath
he
said
quite
softly
in
that
lingo
of
his
childhood
that
always
came
back
to
his
tip
in
times
of
excitement
just
as
shuah
as
yo
bohn
that
priest
will
eat
his
dinner
in
my
cabin
sah
and
if
yo
going
t
make
any
trouble
just
say
so
now
and
we
get
it
ovah
and
the
place
cleaned
up
again
befoh
our
visitors
arrive
mind
what
you
about
mac
growled
potts
you
know
he
could
lick
the
stuffin
out
o
you
the
produced
some
sort
of
indignant
sound
in
his
throat
and
turned
as
if
he
meant
to
go
out
the
colonel
came
a
little
nearer
mac
flung
up
his
head
and
squared
for
battle
potts
in
a
cold
sweat
dropped
a
lot
of
tinware
with
a
rattle
while
the
colonel
said
no
no
we
settle
this
after
the
people
go
mac
then
in
a
whisper
look
here
i
been
trying
to
shield
you
for
ten
days
do
give
yourself
away
now
before
the
first
white
neighbour
that
comes
to
see
us
you
call
yourself
a
christian
just
see
if
you
ca
behave
like
one
for
an
hour
or
two
to
a
cold
and
hungry
come
the
man
we
always
counted
on
do
the
honours
and
take
it
out
of
me
after
our
guests
are
gone
mac
seemed
in
a
haze
he
sat
down
heavily
on
some
beanbags
in
the
corner
and
when
the
newcomers
were
brought
in
and
introduced
he
did
the
honours
by
glowering
at
them
with
red
eyes
never
breaking
his
surly
silence
well
says
father
wills
looking
about
i
must
say
you
very
comfortable
here
if
more
people
made
homes
like
this
there
be
fewer
failures
they
gave
him
the
best
place
by
the
fire
and
potts
dished
up
dinner
there
were
only
two
stools
made
yet
the
boy
rolled
his
section
of
sawed
spruce
over
near
the
priest
and
prepared
to
dine
at
his
side
no
no
said
father
wills
firmly
you
shall
sit
as
far
away
from
this
splendid
blaze
as
you
can
get
or
you
will
have
trouble
with
that
cheek
so
the
boy
had
to
yield
his
place
to
and
join
mac
over
on
the
why
did
you
get
a
parki
when
you
were
at
st
michael
said
the
priest
as
this
change
was
being
effected
we
had
just
as
much
more
than
we
could
carry
besides
i
thought
we
could
buy
furs
up
river
anyway
i
warm
enough
no
you
are
not
returned
the
priest
smiling
you
must
get
a
parki
with
a
hood
i
got
an
arctic
cap
it
rolls
down
over
my
ears
and
goes
all
round
my
neck
just
leaves
a
little
place
in
front
for
my
eyes
yes
wear
that
if
you
go
on
the
trail
but
the
good
of
the
parki
hood
is
that
it
is
trimmed
all
round
with
long
you
see
he
picked
his
parki
up
off
the
floor
and
showed
it
to
the
company
those
long
hairs
standing
out
all
round
the
face
break
the
force
of
the
wind
it
is
wonderful
how
the
esquimaux
hood
lessens
the
chance
of
while
the
only
object
in
the
room
that
he
did
seem
to
see
was
mac
he
was
most
taken
up
with
the
fireplace
the
colonel
laid
great
stress
on
the
enormous
services
of
the
delightful
accomplished
over
there
on
the
beanbags
who
sat
looking
more
than
ever
like
a
incarnate
but
whether
that
jesuit
was
as
wily
as
the
calvinist
thought
he
had
quite
wit
enough
to
overlook
the
great
wrathful
silence
he
was
not
the
least
professional
talked
about
the
country
and
how
to
live
here
saying
incidentally
that
he
had
spent
twelve
years
at
the
mission
of
the
holy
cross
the
yukon
was
a
bad
place
to
live
in
he
told
them
if
men
only
took
the
trouble
to
learn
how
to
live
here
while
teaching
the
indians
there
was
a
great
deal
to
learn
from
them
as
well
you
must
all
come
and
see
our
schools
he
wound
up
we
like
to
awfully
said
the
boy
and
all
but
mac
echoed
him
we
were
so
afraid
he
went
on
that
we
might
see
anybody
all
winter
long
oh
you
have
more
visitors
than
you
want
we
though
then
with
a
modified
rapture
indians
i
suppose
and
and
missionaries
traders
too
and
miners
and
this
year
cheechalkos
as
well
you
are
directly
on
the
great
highway
of
winter
travel
now
that
there
a
good
hard
crust
on
the
snow
you
will
have
passing
every
week
and
sometimes
two
or
three
it
was
good
news
we
already
had
one
visitor
before
you
said
the
boy
looking
wonderfully
pleased
at
the
prospect
the
priest
had
opened
out
you
must
know
nicholas
of
pymeut
do
you
oh
yes
we
all
know
nicholas
and
the
priest
smiled
we
him
returned
the
boy
as
if
some
slighting
criticism
had
been
passed
upon
his
friend
of
course
you
do
so
do
we
all
and
still
that
look
of
quiet
amusement
on
the
worn
face
and
a
keener
twinkle
glinting
in
the
eyes
we
afraid
he
sick
the
boy
began
before
the
priest
could
answer
he
was
educated
at
howly
cross
he
contributed
oh
he
been
to
holy
cross
among
other
places
what
do
you
mean
well
nicholas
is
a
most
impartial
person
he
was
born
at
pymeut
but
his
father
who
is
the
richest
and
most
intelligent
man
in
his
tribe
took
nicholas
to
ikogimeut
when
the
boy
was
only
six
he
was
brought
up
in
the
russian
mission
there
as
the
father
had
been
before
him
and
was
a
greek
in
religion
till
he
was
fourteen
there
was
a
famine
that
year
down
yonder
so
nicholas
turned
catholic
and
came
up
to
us
he
was
at
holy
cross
some
years
when
business
called
him
to
anvik
where
he
turned
episcopalian
at
eagle
city
i
believe
he
is
regarded
as
a
pattern
presbyterian
there
are
those
that
say
since
he
has
been
a
pilot
nicholas
makes
six
changes
a
trip
in
his
religious
convictions
father
wills
saw
that
the
colonel
to
whom
he
most
frequently
addressed
himself
took
his
pleasantry
gravely
nicholas
is
not
a
bad
fellow
he
added
he
told
me
you
had
been
kind
to
him
if
you
believe
that
about
his
insincerity
said
the
colonel
are
you
not
afraid
the
others
you
spend
your
life
teaching
may
turn
out
as
little
credit
to
you
to
christianity
the
priest
glanced
at
the
listening
indian
no
said
he
gravely
i
do
not
think
the
natives
are
like
nicholas
andrew
here
is
a
true
son
of
the
church
but
even
if
it
were
otherwise
you
know
the
jesuit
rose
from
the
table
with
that
calm
smile
of
his
we
simply
do
the
work
without
question
the
issue
is
not
in
our
hands
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
set
back
his
stool
come
andrew
he
said
we
must
push
on
the
indian
repeated
the
priest
action
and
went
out
to
see
to
the
dogs
oh
are
you
going
right
away
said
the
colonel
politely
and
volubly
protested
we
thought
said
the
boy
you
sit
awhile
and
smoke
and
at
least
of
course
i
do
mean
smoke
exactly
but
the
father
smiled
and
shook
his
head
another
time
i
would
stay
gladly
where
are
you
going
now
andrew
and
i
are
on
our
way
to
the
the
steamship
frozen
in
the
ice
below
here
how
far
asked
the
boy
about
seven
miles
below
the
russian
mission
and
a
mile
or
so
up
the
kuskoquim
slough
wrecked
there
oh
no
gone
into
winter
quarters
in
a
slew
for
it
was
so
father
wills
pronounced
oh
that
what
they
call
a
blind
river
up
in
this
country
they
come
into
the
big
streams
every
here
and
there
and
cheechalkos
are
always
mistaking
them
for
the
main
channel
sometimes
they
wider
and
deeper
for
a
mile
or
so
than
the
river
proper
but
before
you
know
it
they
land
you
in
a
marsh
this
place
i
going
to
a
little
way
up
the
kuskoquim
out
of
danger
when
the
ice
breaks
up
has
been
chosen
for
a
new
station
by
the
and
company
rival
you
know
to
the
alaska
commercial
that
inherited
the
russian
fur
monopoly
and
controlled
the
seal
and
salmon
trade
so
long
well
the
younger
company
runs
the
old
one
hard
and
they
sent
this
steamer
into
winter
quarters
loaded
with
provisions
ready
to
start
for
dawson
the
instant
the
ice
goes
out
why
then
it
the
very
boat
that
be
takin
us
to
the
klondyke
you
just
goin
down
to
have
a
look
at
her
asked
potts
enviously
no
i
go
to
get
relief
for
the
pymeuts
what
the
matter
with
epidemic
all
summer
starvation
now
guess
you
wo
find
got
such
a
lot
he
wants
to
give
it
away
to
the
indians
our
father
superior
has
given
much
said
the
priest
gently
but
we
are
not
inexhaustible
at
holy
cross
and
the
long
winter
is
before
us
many
of
the
supply
steamers
have
failed
to
get
in
and
the
country
is
flooded
with
there
be
want
this
year
terrible
suffering
all
up
and
down
the
river
the
more
reason
for
people
to
hold
on
to
what
they
got
a
white
man
worth
more
an
indian
the
priest
face
showed
no
anger
not
even
coldness
white
men
have
got
a
great
deal
out
of
alaska
and
as
yet
done
little
but
harm
here
the
government
ought
to
help
the
natives
and
we
believe
the
government
will
all
we
ask
of
the
captain
of
the
is
to
sell
us
on
fair
terms
a
certain
supply
we
assuming
part
of
the
risk
and
both
of
us
looking
to
the
government
to
make
it
good
reckon
you
find
that
down
in
the
ice
is
worth
its
weight
in
gold
said
potts
one
must
always
try
replied
the
father
he
left
the
doorpost
straightened
his
bowed
back
and
laid
a
hand
on
the
wooden
latch
but
nicholas
when
you
left
pymeut
was
he
began
the
boy
oh
he
is
all
right
the
father
smiled
and
nodded
brother
paul
has
been
looking
after
nicholas
father
the
old
chief
has
enough
food
but
he
has
been
very
by
the
way
have
you
any
letters
you
want
to
send
out
oh
if
we
only
known
was
the
general
chorus
and
potts
flew
to
close
and
stamp
one
he
had
hardly
more
than
begun
to
the
future
potts
the
boy
had
thoughtlessly
opened
the
door
to
have
a
look
at
the
dogs
shut
that
da
do
keep
the
door
open
howled
potts
trying
to
hold
his
precious
letter
down
on
the
table
while
he
added
only
two
words
the
boy
slammed
the
door
behind
him
with
all
our
trouble
the
cabin
is
really
warm
said
the
colonel
apologetically
in
a
wind
like
this
if
the
door
is
open
we
have
to
hold
fast
to
things
to
keep
them
from
running
down
the
yukon
it
a
trial
to
anybody
temper
why
do
you
build
a
false
wall
well
i
do
know
we
had
thought
of
it
you
find
it
correct
this
draught
and
the
priest
explained
his
views
on
the
subject
while
potts
letter
was
being
addressed
andrew
put
his
head
in
ready
father
as
the
priest
was
pocketing
the
letter
the
boy
dashed
in
put
on
the
arctic
cap
he
set
such
store
by
and
a
fur
coat
and
mittens
do
you
mind
if
i
go
a
little
way
with
you
he
said
of
course
not
answered
the
priest
i
will
send
him
back
in
half
an
hour
he
said
low
to
the
colonel
it
a
hitter
day
it
was
curious
how
already
he
had
divined
the
relation
of
the
elder
man
to
the
youngest
of
that
odd
household
the
moment
they
had
gone
mac
with
an
obvious
effort
pulled
himself
up
out
of
his
corner
and
coming
towards
the
colonel
at
the
fireplace
he
said
thickly
you
put
an
insult
upon
me
warren
and
that
what
i
stand
from
no
man
come
outside
the
colonel
looked
at
him
all
right
mac
but
we
just
eaten
a
rousing
big
dinner
even
sullivan
would
accept
that
as
the
moment
for
a
round
we
both
have
forty
winks
hey
and
potts
shall
call
us
and
shall
be
umpire
you
can
have
the
boy
bunk
mac
was
in
a
haze
again
and
allowed
himself
to
be
insinuated
into
bed
the
others
got
rid
of
the
dinner
things
and
sat
round
for
an
hour
doubt
if
he
sleeps
long
says
potts
a
little
before
two
that
what
he
been
doing
all
morning
we
have
had
any
fresh
meat
for
a
week
returns
the
colonel
significantly
why
do
you
and
go
down
to
meet
the
boy
and
come
round
by
the
woods
there
be
full
moon
up
by
four
you
might
get
a
brace
of
grouse
or
a
rabbit
or
two
was
not
very
keen
about
it
but
the
jesuit
visit
had
stirred
him
up
and
he
offered
less
opposition
to
the
unusual
call
to
activity
than
the
colonel
expected
when
at
last
he
was
left
alone
with
the
sleeping
man
the
kentuckian
put
on
a
couple
more
logs
and
sat
down
to
wait
at
three
he
got
up
swung
the
crane
round
so
that
the
darting
tongues
of
flame
could
lick
the
pot
and
then
he
measured
out
some
coffee
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
cabin
was
full
of
the
fragrance
of
good
mocha
the
colonel
sat
and
waited
presently
he
poured
out
a
little
coffee
and
drank
it
slowly
blissfully
with
eyes
but
when
he
had
set
the
granite
cup
down
again
he
stood
up
alert
like
a
man
ready
for
business
mac
had
been
asleep
nearly
three
hours
the
others
be
long
now
well
if
they
came
prematurely
they
must
go
to
the
little
cabin
for
awhile
the
colonel
shot
the
bar
across
door
and
jamb
for
the
second
time
that
day
mac
stirred
and
lifted
himself
on
his
elbow
but
he
was
really
awake
potts
he
said
huskily
the
colonel
made
no
sound
potts
measure
me
out
two
fingers
will
you
cabin
damn
cold
no
answer
mac
roused
himself
muttering
compliments
for
potts
when
he
had
bundled
himself
out
over
the
side
of
the
bunk
he
saw
the
colonel
seemingly
dozing
by
the
fire
he
waited
a
moment
then
very
softly
he
made
his
way
to
the
farther
end
of
the
the
colonel
opened
one
eye
shut
it
and
shuffled
in
a
sleepy
sort
of
way
mac
turned
sharply
back
to
the
fire
the
colonel
opened
his
eyes
and
yawned
i
made
some
cawfee
a
little
while
back
have
some
no
better
it
a
where
potts
gone
out
for
a
little
back
soon
he
poured
out
some
of
the
strong
black
decoction
and
presented
it
to
his
companion
just
try
it
finest
cawfee
in
the
world
sir
mac
poured
it
down
without
seeming
to
bother
about
tasting
it
they
sat
quite
still
after
that
till
the
colonel
said
meditatively
you
and
i
had
a
little
account
to
settle
did
we
i
ready
but
neither
moved
for
several
moments
see
here
mac
you
have
been
ill
or
anything
like
that
have
you
no
there
was
no
uncertain
note
in
the
answer
if
anything
there
was
in
it
more
than
the
usual
toneless
decision
mac
voice
was
as
innocent
of
modulation
as
a
and
with
the
same
uncompromising
finality
as
the
shooting
of
a
bolt
i
ready
to
stand
up
against
any
man
good
interrupted
the
colonel
glad
o
that
for
i
just
longing
to
see
you
stand
up
mac
was
on
his
feet
in
a
flash
you
had
only
to
say
so
if
you
wanted
to
see
me
stand
up
against
any
man
alive
and
when
i
sit
down
again
it
my
opinion
one
of
us
two
wo
be
any
more
he
pushed
back
the
stools
i
thought
maybe
it
was
only
necessary
to
mention
it
said
the
colonel
slowly
i
been
wanting
for
a
fortnight
to
see
you
stand
up
mac
turned
fiercely
against
samuel
david
maccann
come
on
i
in
no
mood
for
monkeyin
nor
i
realise
maccann
we
come
to
a
kind
of
a
crisis
things
in
this
camp
are
either
going
a
lot
better
or
a
lot
worse
after
there
nothing
wrong
if
you
quit
asking
dirty
jesuits
to
sit
down
with
honest
men
yes
there
something
worse
out
o
shape
than
that
mac
waited
warily
when
we
were
stranded
here
and
saw
what
we
let
ourselves
in
for
there
was
one
of
us
that
did
think
things
looked
pretty
much
like
the
last
o
pea
time
there
was
just
one
circumstance
that
kept
us
from
throwing
up
the
sponge
had
a
man
in
camp
the
colonel
paused
mac
stood
as
expressionless
as
the
wooden
crane
a
man
we
all
believed
in
who
was
going
to
help
us
pull
through
that
was
you
i
mac
hard
voice
chopped
out
the
sarcasm
you
know
mighty
well
who
it
was
the
boy
all
right
but
he
young
for
this
kind
o
thing
young
and
heady
there
is
much
wrong
with
me
that
i
aware
of
except
that
i
do
know
shucks
potts
petering
out
was
altogether
a
surprise
and
nobody
expected
anything
from
till
we
got
to
dawson
when
a
lawyer
and
a
fella
with
capital
behind
him
may
come
in
handy
but
there
was
one
man
who
had
a
head
on
him
who
had
experience
and
who
he
leaned
over
to
emphasise
the
climax
who
had
it
was
on
that
man
account
that
i
joined
this
party
mac
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
leaned
against
the
wall
his
face
began
to
look
a
little
more
natural
the
long
sleep
or
the
coffee
had
cleared
his
eyes
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
heard
about
that
man
last
night
asked
the
colonel
gravely
mac
looked
up
but
never
opened
his
lips
you
remember
you
would
sit
here
the
boy
was
always
in
and
out
the
cabin
was
cold
i
left
the
boy
and
at
and
went
down
to
the
little
cabin
to
to
see
what
i
was
doin
to
spy
on
me
well
all
right
maybe
i
was
spying
too
incidentally
i
wanted
to
tell
you
the
cabin
was
hot
as
blazes
and
get
you
to
come
to
supper
i
met
potts
hurrying
up
for
his
grub
and
i
said
mac
is
he
coming
and
your
pardner
answer
was
let
him
alone
he
got
a
flask
in
his
bunk
swillin
and
gruntin
he
just
in
damn
that
sneak
the
man
he
was
talkin
about
mac
was
the
man
we
had
all
built
our
hopes
on
i
teach
potts
you
ca
mac
potts
has
got
to
die
and
go
to
heaven
perhaps
to
hell
before
he
learn
any
good
but
you
a
different
breed
teach
maccann
mac
suddenly
sat
down
on
the
stool
with
his
head
in
his
hands
the
boy
has
caught
on
said
the
colonel
presently
but
he
said
something
this
morning
to
show
he
was
wondering
about
the
change
come
over
you
that
i
do
split
wood
all
day
i
suppose
when
we
got
enough
for
a
month
potts
does
either
why
do
you
go
for
potts
as
the
boy
said
i
do
care
about
potts
it
mac
that
matters
did
the
boy
say
that
he
looked
up
the
colonel
nodded
after
you
had
made
that
chimney
you
know
you
were
a
kind
of
hero
in
his
eyes
mac
looked
away
the
cabin
been
cold
he
muttered
we
are
going
to
remedy
that
i
did
bring
any
liquor
into
camp
you
must
admit
that
i
intend
i
do
admit
it
and
when
said
that
about
keeping
his
big
demijohn
out
of
the
inventory
and
apart
from
the
common
stores
i
sat
on
him
so
you
did
i
knew
it
was
safest
to
act
on
the
purposes
principle
so
it
is
but
i
was
thinking
so
much
of
i
was
thinking
of
things
that
had
happened
before
for
i
had
experience
drink
was
the
curse
of
caribou
it
something
of
a
scourge
up
in
nova
scotia
had
experience
you
did
the
very
best
thing
possible
under
the
circumstances
mac
was
feeling
about
after
his
and
must
be
helped
to
get
hold
of
it
i
realise
too
that
the
temptation
is
much
greater
in
cold
countries
said
the
kentuckian
unblushingly
italians
and
greeks
do
want
fiery
drinks
half
as
much
as
russians
and
scandinavians
have
the
same
craving
as
nova
scotians
and
people
generally
i
suppose
but
that
only
shows
temperance
is
of
more
vital
importance
in
the
north
that
right
it
not
much
in
my
line
to
shift
blame
even
when
i
do
deserve
it
but
you
know
so
much
you
might
as
well
know
it
was
i
who
opened
that
demijohn
first
but
you
do
mind
being
the
one
to
shut
it
up
do
you
shut
it
up
yes
let
get
it
down
and
the
colonel
swung
it
off
the
shelf
it
was
nearly
empty
and
only
the
boy
and
the

single
bottles
stood
unbroached
even
so
mac
prolonged
spree
was
something
of
a
mystery
to
the
kentuckian
it
must
be
that
a
very
little
was
too
much
for
mac
the
colonel
handed
the
demijohn
to
his
companion
and
lit
the
solitary
candle
standing
on
its
little
block
of
wood
held
in
place
between
three
nails
what
that
for
do
you
want
to
seal
it
up
i
have
got
any
wax
i
have
an
inch
or
so
the
colonel
produced
out
of
his
pocket
the
only
piece
in
camp
mac
picked
up
a
billet
of
wood
and
drove
the
cork
in
flush
with
the
neck
then
placing
upright
on
the
cork
the
helve
of
the
hammer
he
drove
the
cork
down
a
quarter
of
an
inch
farther
give
me
your
wax
what
for
a
seal
they
looked
about
mac
eye
fell
on
a
metal
button
that
hung
by
a
thread
from
the
old
militia
jacket
he
was
wearing
he
put
his
hand
up
to
it
paused
glanced
hurriedly
at
the
colonel
and
let
his
fingers
fall
yes
yes
said
the
kentuckian
that
make
a
capital
seal
no
something
of
yours
i
think
colonel
the
top
of
that
tony
hey
the
colonel
produced
his
gold
pencil
watched
mac
heat
the
wax
drop
it
into
the
neck
of
the
demijohn
and
apply
the
initialled
end
of
the
colonel
property
while
mac
without
any
further
waste
of
words
was
swinging
the
temptation
up
on
the
shelf
again
they
heard
voices
they
coming
back
says
the
kentuckian
hurriedly
but
settled
our
little
account
have
we
old
man
mac
jerked
his
head
in
that
automatic
fashion
that
with
him
meant
genial
and
agreement
and
if
potts
or
want
to
break
that
seal
i
call
down
says
mac
and
the
colonel
knew
the
seal
was
safe

the
boy
just
as
he
was
turning
in
that
night
i

i
asked

one
of
the
curious
results
of
what
is
called
wild
life
is
a
blessed
release
from
many
of
the
timidities
that
assail
the
easy
liver
in
the
centres
of
civilisation
potts
was
the
only
one
in
the
white
camp
who
had
doubts
about
the
wisdom
of
having
to
do
with
the
natives
however
the
agreeable
necessity
of
going
to
pymeut
to
invite
nicholas
to
the
was
not
forced
upon
the
boy
they
were
still
hard
at
it
four
days
after
the
jesuit
had
gone
his
way
surrounding
the
big
cabin
with
a
false
wall
that
final
and
effectual
barrier
against
boreas
finishing
touch
warranted
to
convert
a
cabin
so
cold
that
it
drove
its
inmates
to
drink
into
a
dwelling
where
practical
people
without
cracking
a
dreary
joke
might
fitly
celebrate
a
in
spite
of
the
shortness
of
the
days
father
wills
suggestion
was
being
carried
out
with
a
gratifying
success
already
manifest
were
the
advantages
of
the
stockade
running
at
a
foot
distance
round
the
cabin
to
the
height
of
the
eaves
made
of
spruce
saplings
not
even
lopped
of
their
short
bushy
branches
but
planted
close
together
after
burning
the
ground
cleared
of
snow
a
second
visitation
of
mild
weather
and
a
further
two
days
thaw
made
the
colonel
determine
to
fill
in
the
space
between
the
spruce
stockade
and
the
cabin
with
soil
closely
packed
down
and
well
tramped
in
it
was
generally
conceded
as
the
winter
wore
on
that
to
this
contrivance
of
the
earthwork
belonged
a
good
half
of
the
credit
of
the
big
cabin
and
its
renown
as
being
the
warmest
spot
on
the
lower
river
that
terrible
memorable
year
of
the
klondyke
rush
the
evergreen
wall
with
the
big
stone
chimney
shouldering
itself
up
to
look
out
upon
the
frozen
highway
became
a
conspicuous
feature
in
the
landscape
welcome
as
the
weeks
went
on
to
many
an
eye
wearied
with
long
looking
for
shelter
and
blinded
by
the
waste
an
exception
to
what
became
a
rule
was
of
all
men
nicholas
when
the
stockade
was
half
done
the
prince
and
an
equerry
appeared
on
the
horizon
with
the
second
team
the
camp
had
seen
the
driver
much
concerned
to
steer
clear
of
the
softened
snow
and
keep
to
that
part
of
the
river
ice
windswept
and
firm
if
roughest
of
all
nicholas
regarded
the
stockade
with
a
cold
and
beady
eye
no
he
had
time
to
look
at
it
he
had
promised
to
mush
he
even
hungry
it
did
little
credit
to
his
heart
but
he
seemed
more
in
haste
to
leave
his
new
friends
than
the
least
friendly
of
them
would
have
expected
oh
wait
a
urged
the
deeply
disappointed
boy
i
wanted
to
see
how
your
sled
is
made
it
better
father
wills
humph
grunted
nicholas
scornfully
him
no
got
innuit
sled
mac
and
i
are
goin
to
try
soon
the
stockade
done
interrupted
nicholas
but
the
boy
paid
no
attention
to
the
word
of
farewell
he
knelt
down
in
the
snow
and
examined
the
sled
carefully
spruce
runners
he
called
out
to
mac
and
jee
they
shod
with
ivory
fastened
with
sinew
and
wooden
pegs
hey
looking
up
incredulously
at
nicholas
not
a
nail
in
the
whole
shebang
eh
nail
says
nicholas
huh
no
as
contemptuously
as
though
the
boy
had
said
well
she
a
daisy
when
you
comin
back
comin
pretty
quick
goin
pretty
quick
shouted
nicholas
to
his
companion
and
the
dogs
got
up
off
their
haunches
but
the
boy
only
laughed
at
nicholas
struggles
to
get
started
he
hung
on
to
the
loaded
sled
examining
praising
while
the
dogs
after
the
merest
affectation
of
trying
to
make
a
start
looked
round
at
him
over
their
loose
collars
and
grinned
contentedly
me
got
to
mush
show
nex
time
mush
what
here
the
boy
shouted
through
the
mushing
and
he
tugged
at
the
goodly
load
so
neatly
disposed
under
an
old
and
lashed
down
with
raw
hide
that
oh
that
was
fish
fish
got
so
much
fish
at
starving
pymeut
you
can
go
hauling
it
down
river
well
sir

have
fish
hey
the
boy
appealed
to
the
others
yes
i
reckon
we
just
do
but
nicholas
had
other
views
no
me
take
him
he
hitched
his
body
in
the
direction
of
ikogimeut
bless
my
soul
you
got
enough
there
for
a
regiment
you
goin
to
sell
him
hey
nicholas
shook
his
head
oh
come
off
the
roof
advised
the
boy
genially
you
ai
carryin
it
about
for
your
health
i
suppose
said
potts
the
people
down
at
ikogimeut
do
need
it
like
us
we
white
duffers
and
ca
get
fish
through
the
ice
you
sell
of
it
to
us
but
nicholas
shook
his
head
and
shuffled
along
on
his
beckoning
the
to
follow
or
trade
some
fur
fur
tay
suggested
or
for
sugar
said
mac
or
for
tobacco
tempted
the
colonel
and
before
that
last
word
nicholas
resolve
went
down
up
at
the
cabin
he
unlashed
the
load
and
it
quickly
became
manifest
that
nicholas
was
a
dandy
at
driving
a
bargain
he
kept
on
saying
shamelessly
more
more
shuhg
hey
oh
yes
me
give
heap
fish
no
nuff
shuhg
if
it
had
been
for
mac
his
own
self
again
and
by
no
means
to
be
humbugged
by
any
prince
alive
the
purchase
of
a
portion
of
that
load
of
frozen
fish
corded
up
like
so
much
wood
would
have
laid
waste
the
commissariat
but
if
the
white
men
after
this
passage
did
not
feel
an
absolute
confidence
in
nicholas
fairness
of
mind
no
such
unworthy
suspicion
of
them
found
lodgment
in
the
bosom
of
the
prince
with
the
exception
of
some
tobacco
he
left
all
his
store
to
be
kept
for
him
by
his
new
friends
till
he
should
return
when
was
that
to
be
in
five
sleeps
he
would
be
back
good
we
have
the
stockade
done
by
then
what
do

say
to
our
big
chimney
nicholas
he
emitted
a
scornful
peeluck
what

shrugged

he
shivered
in
anticipation
of
what
was
to
happen
peeluck
the
white
men
laughed
what
you
up
to
now
where
you
going
well
the
fact
was
nicholas
had
been
sent
by
his
great
ally

he
drew
on
his
mittens
proudly
unjarred
by
remembrance
of
how
his
good
resolution
had
come
to
grief
where
you
off
to

nicholas
nodded
hooray

shouted
the
boy
and
by
saturday
that
five
sleeps
we
have
the
wall
done
and
the
house
warm
and
you
and
he
caught
himself
up
not
thus
in
public
would
he
break
the
news
to
mac
you
be
back
in
time
for
the
big
to
clinch
matters
he
accompanied
nicholas
from
the
cabin
to
the
river
trail
explaining
you
savvy
big
feast
all
same
indian
heap
good
grub
no
you

no
church
this
time
big
fire
big
feed
all
kinds
apples
shuhg
bacon
no
cook
him
you
no
like
he
added
basely
truckling
to
the
prince
peculiar
taste
nicholas
rolled
his
single
eye
in
joyful
anticipation
and
promised
faithfully
to
grace
the
scene
this
was
all
very
fine
but
father
wills
the
last
thing
at
night
and
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
the
boy
looked
the
problem
in
the
face
and
devised
now
this
now
that
adroit
and
disarming
fashion
of
breaking
the
news
to
mac
but
it
was
only
when
the
daring
giver
of
invitations
was
safely
in
bed
and
mac
equally
safe
down
in
the
little
cabin
that
it
seemed
possible
to
broach
the
subject
he
devised
scenes
in
which
airily
and
triumphantly
he
introduced
father
wills
and
brought
mac
to
the
point
of
pining
for
jesuit
society
but
these
scenes
were
actable
only
under
conditions
of
darkness
and
of
solitude
the
colonel
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
matter
our
first
business
as
i
see
it
is
to
keep
peace
in
the
camp
and
hold
fast
to
a
good
understanding
with
one
another
it
just
over
little
things
like
this
that
trouble
begins
mac
one
of
us
father
wills
is
an
outsider
i
wo
rile
mac
for
the
sake
of
any
jesuit
alive
no
sir
this
is
funeral
and
you
obliged
to
attend
before
three
of
nicholas
five
sleeps
were
accomplished
the
boy
began
to
curse
the
hour
he
had
laid
eyes
on
father
wills
he
began
even
to
speculate
desperately
on
the
good
priest
chances
of
tumbling
into
an
or
being
devoured
by
a
timely
wolf
but
no
life
was
never
so
considerate
as
that
yet
he
could
neither
face
being
the
cause
of
the
first
serious
row
in
camp
nor
endure
the
thought
of
having
his
particular
guest
drat
him
flouted
and
the
whole
turned
to
failure
and
humiliation
indeed
the
case
looked
desperate
only
one
day
more
now
before
he
would
appear
be
flouted
insulted
and
go
off
wounded
angry
leaving
the
boy
with
an
irreconciliable
quarrel
against
mac
and
the
turned
to
chill
recrimination
and
to
wretchedness
but
until
the
last
phantasmal
hope
went
down
before
the
logic
of
events
it
was
impossible
not
to
cling
to
the
idea
of
melting
mac
arctic
heart
there
was
still
one
course
untried
since
there
was
so
little
left
to
do
to
the
stockade
the
boy
announced
that
he
thought
he
go
up
over
the
hill
for
a
tramp
gun
in
hand
and
grub
in
pocket
he
marched
off
to
play
his
last
if
he
could
bring
home
a
queer
enough
bird
or
beast
for
the
collection
there
was
still
hope
to
what
lengths
might
mac
not
go
if
one
dangled
before
him
the
priceless
bait
of
a
emperor
goose
dressed
in
imperial
robes
of
snow
or
who
knowing
mac
would
not
trust
a
to
play
the
part
of
a
angel
of
peace
failing
some
such
heavenly
messenger
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
that
the
boy
should
face
the
ignominy
of
going
forth
to
meet
the
father
on
the
morrow
and
confess
the
humiliating
truth
it
was
fair
to
let
him
come
expecting
hospitality
and
find
visions
arose
of
mac
receiving
the
bent
and
wayworn
missionary
with
the
greeting
there
is
no
corner
by
the
fire
no
place
in
the
camp
for
a
pander
to
the
scarlet
woman
the
thought
lent
impassioned
fervour
to
the
quest
for
goose
or
gull
it
was
pretty
late
when
he
got
back
to
camp
and
the
men
were
at
supper
no
he
had
shot
anything
what
that
bulging
in
your
pocket
sort
o
stone
struck
it
rich
do
give
me
any
boys
give
me
tea
i
but
when
mac
got
up
first
as
usual
to
go
down
to
the
little
cabin
to
wood
up
for
the
night
i
walk
down
with
you
says
the
boy
though
it
was
plain
he
was
he
helped
to
revive
the
failing
fire
and
then
dropping
on
the
section
of
sawed
wood
that
did
duty
for
a
chair
with
some
difficulty
and
a
deal
of
tugging
he
pulled
the
sort
o
stone
out
of
the
pocket
of
his
duck
see
that
he
held
the
thing
tightly
clasped
in
his
two
red
chapped
hands
mac
bent
down
shading
his
eyes
from
the
faint
flame
flicker
what
is
it
piece
o
tooth
by
the
lord
harry
so
it
is
he
took
the
thing
nearer
the
faint
light
fossil
where
you
get
it
over
yonder
by
a
little
frozen
river
how
far
any
more
only
this
the
boy
did
answer
he
went
outside
and
returned
instantly
lugging
in
something
brown
and
whitish
unwieldy
i
dropped
this
at
the
door
as
i
came
along
home
thought
it
might
do
for
the
collection
mac
stared
with
all
his
eyes
and
hurriedly
lit
a
candle
the
boy
dropped
exhausted
on
a
ragged
bit
of
burlap
by
the
bunks
mac
knelt
down
opposite
pouring
liberal
libation
of
on
the
uncouth
bony
mass
between
them
part
of
the
skull
he
rasped
out
masking
his
ecstasy
as
well
as
he
could
mastodon
inquired
the
boy
mac
shook
his
head
i
bet
my
boots
says
mac
it
an
primigenius
and
if
i
right
it
find
young
man
where
you
stumble
on
him
over
yonder
the
boy
leaned
his
head
against
the
lower
bunk
where
across
the
divide
the
bones
have
been
dragged
up
on
to
some
rocks
i
saw
the
end
of
a
tusk
stickin
up
out
of
the
snow
and
i
scratched
down
till
i
found
he
indicated
the
trophy
between
them
on
the
floor
tusk
how
long
nine
feet
we
go
and
get
it
no
answer
from
the
boy
early
hey

a
it
a
good
ways

if
it
is
oh
i
do
mind
i
do
more
that
for
you

was
something
unnatural
in
such
devotion
mac
looked
up
but
the
boy
was
too
tired
to
play
the
big
fish
any
longer
i
wonder
if
do
something
for
me
he
watched
with
a
sinking
heart
mac
sharp
uprising
from
the
worshipful
attitude
it
was
not
like
any
other
mortal
gradual
it
was
more
like
the
sudden
springing
out
of
the
big
blade
of
a
what
your
game
oh
i
ai
got
any
game
said
the
boy
desperately
or
if
i
have
there
mighty
little
fun
in
it
however
i
do
know
as
i
want
to
walk
ten
hours
again
in
this
kind
o
weather
with
an
elephant
on
my
back
just
for
for
the
poetry
o
the
thing
he
laid
his
chapped
hands
on
the
side
board
of
the
bunk
and
pulled
himself
up
on
his
legs
what
your
game
repeated
mac
sternly
as
the
boy
reached
the
door
what
the
good
o
talkin
he
answered
but
he
paused
turned
and
leaned
heavily
against
the
rude
lintel
course
i
know
you
be
shot
before
you
do
it
but
what
i
would
be
to
hear
you
say
you
would
kick
up
a
hell
of
a
row
if
father
wills
happens
in
to
the
mac
jerked
his
set
face
towards
the
and
he
without
waiting
for
more
simply
opened
the
door
and
heavily
footed
it
back
to
the
big
cabin
next
morning
when
mac
came
to
breakfast
he
heard
that
the
boy
had
had
his
grub
half
an
hour
before
the
usual
time
and
was
gone
off
on
some
tramp
again
mac
sat
and
mused
came
in
with
a
dripping
bucket
and
sat
down
to
breakfast
shivering
which
way
he
go
the
boy
down
river
sure
he
did
go
over
the
divide
was
sure
he
just
been
down
to
the
and
in
the
faint
light
he
seen
the
boy
far
down
on
the
leppin
like
a
hare
in
the
direction
of
the
roosian
mission
goin
to
meet
a
nicholas
reckon
so
said
the
colonel
a
bit
ruffled
do
believe
he
run
like
a
hare
very
far
with
his
feet
all
blistered
did
you
know
he
discovered
a
fossil
elephant
no
well
he
has
i
must
light
out
too
and
have
a
look
at
it
do
it
be
a
cheerful
sort
of
with
one
of
you
off
scouring
the
country
for
more
blisters
and
chilblains
and
another
huntin
antediluvian
elephants
the
colonel
spoke
with
uncommon
irascibility
the
great
had
certainly
not
dawned
propitiously
when
breakfast
was
done
mac
left
the
big
cabin
without
a
word
but
instead
of
going
over
the
divide
across
the
treeless
to
the
little
frozen
river
where
turned
up
to
the
pale
northern
dawn
were
lying
the
bones
of
a
beast
that
had
trampled
tropic
forests
in
that
other
dawn
of
the
prime
the
naturalist
turning
his
back
on
primigenius
followed
in
the
track
of
the
boy
down
the
great
river
towards
ikogimeut
on
the
low
left
bank
of
the
yukon
a
little
camp
on
one
side
a
big
rock
hooded
with
snow
at
right
angles
drawn
up
one
on
top
of
the
other
two
sleds
covered
with
held
down
by
stones
in
the
corner
formed
by
the
angle
of
rocks
and
sleds
a
small
very
stained
and
old
burning
before
it
on
a
hearth
of
greenwood
a
little
fire
struggling
with
a
veering
wind
mac
had
seen
from
far
off
the
faint
blue
banners
of
smoke
blowing
now
right
now
left
then
tossed
aloft
in
the
pallid
sunshine
he
looked
about
sharply
for
the
boy
as
he
had
been
doing
this
two
hours
there
was
the
jesuit
bending
over
the
fire
bettering
the
precarious
position
of
a
saucepan
that
insisted
on
sitting
looking
down
into
the
heart
of
coals
nicholas
was
holding
up
the
hello
how
do
he
sang
out
recognising
mac
the
priest
glanced
up
and
nodded
pleasantly
two
indians
squatting
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
scrambled
away
as
the
shifting
wind
brought
a
cloud
of
stifling
smoke
into
their
faces
where
the
boy
demanded
mac
arresting
the
stampede
nicholas
stared
winked
and
wiped
his
weeping
eyes
is
he
in
there
mac
looked
towards
the
tent
andrew
nodded
between
coughs
what
he
doing
in
there
call
him
out
ordered
mac
he
no
walk
mac
hard
face
took
on
a
look
of
tragedy
the
wind
veering
round
again
had
brought
the
last
words
to
the
priest
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
oh
it
be
all
right
he
said
cheerfully
but
knocking
up
like
that
just
for
blisters
blisters
no
cold
and
general
weakness
that
why
we
delayed
without
waiting
to
hear
more
mac
strode
over
to
the
tent
and
as
he
went
in
nicholas
came
out
no
sign
of
the
boy
nobody
nothing
what
down
in
the
corner
a
small
yellow
face
lying
in
a
nest
of
fur
bright
dark
eyes
stared
roundly
and
as
mac
glowered
astonished
at
the
apparition
a
mouth
full
of
gleaming
teeth
opened
smiling
to
say
in
a
very
small
voice
farva
astonished
as
mac
was
disappointed
and
relieved
all
at
once
there
was
something
arresting
in
the
appeal
i
not
your
father
he
said
stiffly
who
you
hey
you
speak
english
the
child
stared
at
him
fixedly
but
suddenly
for
no
reason
on
earth
it
smiled
again
mac
stood
looking
down
at
it
seeming
lost
in
thought
presently
the
small
object
stirred
struggled
about
feebly
under
the
encompassing
furs
and
freeing
itself
held
out
its
arms
the
mites
of
hands
fluttered
at
his
sleeve
and
made
ineffectual
clutches
what
do
you
want
to
his
own
vast
astonishment
mac
lifted
the
little
thing
out
of
its
warm
nest
it
was
woefully
thin
and
seemed
even
to
his
inexperience
to
be
insufficiently
clothed
though
the
beaded
moccasins
on
its
tiny
feet
were
new
and
good
why
you
only
about
as
big
as
a
minute
he
said
gruffly
the
matter
sick
it
suddenly
struck
him
as
very
extraordinary
that
he
should
have
taken
up
the
child
and
how
extremely
embarrassing
it
would
be
if
anyone
came
in
and
caught
him
clutching
the
small
morsel
awkwardly
he
fumbled
with
the
furs
preparatory
to
getting
rid
without
delay
of
the
unusual
burden
while
he
was
straightening
the
things
father
wills
appeared
at
the
flap
smoking
saucepan
in
hand
the
instant
the
cold
air
struck
the
child
it
began
to
cough
oh
you
must
do
that
said
the
priest
to
mac
with
unexpected
severity
kaviak
must
lie
in
bed
and
keep
warm
down
on
the
floor
went
the
saucepan
the
child
was
caught
away
from
the
surprised
mac
and
the
furs
so
closely
gathered
round
the
small
shrunken
body
that
there
was
once
more
nothing
visible
but
the
wistful
yellow
face
and
gleaming
eyes
still
turned
searchingly
on
its
most
recent
acquaintance
but
the
priest
without
so
much
as
a
glance
at
the
proceeded
to
feed
kaviak
out
of
the
saucepan
blowing
vigorously
at
each
spoonful
before
administering
he
pretty
hungry
commented
mac
where
you
find
him
in
a
little
village
up
on
the
kuskoquim
kaviak
an
esquimaux
from
norton
sound
are
you
kaviak
but
the
child
was
wholly
absorbed
it
seemed
in
swallowing
and
staring
at
mac
his
family
came
up
there
from
the
coast
in
a
bidarra
only
last
summer
all
dead
now
everybody
else
in
the
village
and
there
is
but
a
handful
all
ailing
and
all
hungry
i
was
tramping
across
an
igloo
there
a
couple
of
days
ago
and
i
heard
a
strange
little
muffled
sound
more
like
a
snared
rabbit
than
anything
else
but
the
indian
with
me
said
no
everybody
who
had
lived
there
was
dead
and
he
was
for
hurrying
on
they
superstitious
you
know
about
a
place
where
people
have
died
but
i
crawled
in
and
found
this
little
thing
lying
in
a
bundle
of
rags
with
its
hands
bound
and
dried
grass
stuffed
in
its
mouth
it
was
too
weak
to
stir
or
do
more
than
occasionally
to
make
that
muffled
noise
that
i
heard
coming
up
through
the
what
you
goin
to
do
with
him
well
i
hardly
know
the
sisters
will
look
after
him
for
a
while
if
i
get
him
there
alive
why
should
you
kaviak
supplied
the
answer
straightway
by
choking
and
falling
into
an
appalling
fit
of
coughing
i
got
some
stuff
that
be
good
for
that
said
mac
thinking
of
his
i
give
you
some
when
we
get
back
to
camp
the
priest
nodded
taking
mac
unheard
of
civility
as
a
matter
of
course
the
ice
is
very
rough
the
jolting
makes
him
cough
awfully
the
jesuit
had
fastened
his
eyes
on
mac
woollen
muffler
which
had
been
loosened
during
the
ministering
to
kaviak
and
had
dropped
on
the
ground
do
you
need
that
scarf
he
asked
as
though
he
suspected
mac
of
wearing
it
for
show
because
if
you
did
you
could
wrap
it
round
kaviak
while
i
help
the
men
strike
camp
and
without
waiting
to
see
how
his
suggestion
was
received
he
caught
up
the
saucepan
lifted
the
flap
and
vanished
farva
remarked
kaviak
fixing
melancholy
eyes
on
mac
i
ai
your
father
muttered
the
gentleman
so
addressed
he
picked
up
his
scarf
and
hung
it
round
his
own
neck
farva
insisted
kaviak
they
looked
at
each
other
you
cold
that
it
hey
mac
knelt
down
and
pulled
away
the
furs
god
bless
me
you
only
got
this
one
rag
on
god
bless
me
he
pulled
off
his
muffler
and
wound
the
child
in
it
round
and
round
muttering
the
while
in
a
surly
way
when
it
was
half
done
he
stopped
thought
profoundly
with
a
furrow
cutting
deep
into
his
square
forehead
between
the
straight
brows
slowly
he
pulled
his
gloves
out
of
his
pocket
and
turned
out
from
each
beaver
gauntlet
an
inner
mitten
of
knitted
wool
here
he
said
and
put
both
little
moccasined
feet
into
one
of
the
capacious
mittens
much
pleased
with
his
ingenuity
he
went
on
winding
the
long
scarf
until
the
yellow
little
esquimaux
bore
a
certain
whimsical
resemblance
to
one
of
the
adorable
delia
robbia
infants
but
mac
sinewy
hands
were
exerting
a
greater
pressure
than
he
realized
the
morsel
made
a
remonstrant
squeaking
and
squirmed
feebly
oh
oh
too
tight
beg
your
pardon
said
mac
hastily
as
though
not
only
english
but
punctilious
manners
were
understanded
of
kaviak
he
relaxed
the
woollen
bandage
till
the
morsel
lay
contented
again
within
its
folds
nicholas
came
in
for
kaviak
and
for
the
furs
that
he
might
pack
them
both
in
the
father
sled
already
the
true
son
of
the
church
was
undoing
the
ropes
that
lashed
firm
the
canvas
of
the
tent
where
the
boy
said
mac
suddenly
the
young
fellow
that
with
us
you
know
the
one
that
found
you
that
first
sunday
and
brought
you
to
camp
where
is
he
nicholas
paused
an
instant
with
kaviak
on
his
shoulder
kaiomi
no
savvy
you
not
seen
him
no
he
no
up
with
the
swaddled
child
he
made
a
gesture
up
the
river
towards
the
white
camp
no
he
came
down
this
morning
to
meet
you
nicholas
shook
his
head
and
went
on
gathering
up
the
furs
as
he
and
mac
came
out
andrew
was
undoing
the
last
fastening
that
held
the
canvas
to
the
stakes
in
ten
minutes
they
were
on
the
trail
andrew
leading
with
father
wills
dogs
kaviak
lying
in
the
sled
muffled
to
the
eyes
still
looking
round
out
of
the
corners
no
strangely
enough
the
kaviak
eye
had
no
corners
but
fixedly
he
stared
sideways
at
mac
farva
seeming
not
to
take
the
smallest
notice
trudged
along
on
one
side
of
him
the
priest
on
the
other
and
behind
came
nicholas
and
the
other
indians
with
the
second
sled
it
was
too
windy
to
talk
much
even
had
they
been
inclined
the
only
sounds
were
the
mush
of
the
drivers
the
grate
and
swish
of
the
runners
over
the
ice
and
kaviak
coughing
mac
turned
once
and
frowned
at
him
it
was
curious
that
the
child
seemed
not
to
mind
these
menacing
looks
not
in
the
smallest
degree
the
order
of
march
was
disturbed
kaviak
right
runner
catching
at
some
obstacle
swerved
and
sent
the
sled
bumping
along
on
its
side
the
small
head
of
the
passenger
narrowly
escaping
the
ice
mac
caught
hold
of
the
and
brought
the
racing
dogs
to
an
abrupt
halt
the
priest
and
he
righted
the
sled
and
mac
straddling
it
tucked
in
a
loosened
end
of
fur
when
all
was
again
in
running
order
mac
was
on
the
same
side
as
father
wills
he
still
wore
that
look
of
dour
and
especially
did
he
glower
at
the
unfortunate
kaviak
seized
with
a
fresh
fit
of
coughing
that
filled
the
round
eyes
with
tears
do
you
get
kind
o
tired
listenin
to
that
noise
suppose
i
was
to
carry
just
for
a
bit
this
is
the
roughest
place
on
the
trail
hi
stop
he
called
to
andrew
the
priest
had
said
nothing
but
divining
what
mac
would
be
at
he
helped
him
to
undo
the
lashing
and
when
kaviak
was
withdrawn
he
wrapped
one
of
the
lighter
fur
things
round
him
it
was
only
when
mac
had
marched
off
glowering
still
and
sternly
refusing
to
meet
kaviak
tearful
but
grateful
eyes
it
was
only
then
bending
over
the
sled
and
making
fast
the
furs
that
father
wills
all
to
himself
smiled
a
little
it
was
until
they
were
in
sight
of
the
smoke
from
the
little
cabin
that
mac
slackened
his
pace
he
had
never
for
a
moment
found
the
trail
so
smooth
that
he
could
return
his
burden
to
the
sled
now
however
he
allowed
nicholas
and
the
priest
to
catch
up
with
him
you
carry
him
the
rest
of
the
way
he
commanded
and
set
his
burden
in
nicholas
arms
kaviak
was
but
mac
falling
behind
with
the
priest
stalked
on
with
eyes
upon
the
ground
i
got
a
boy
of
my
own
he
jerked
out
presently
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
accounts
confidentially
for
some
weakness
really
returned
the
priest
they
did
tell
me
i
have
told
them
yet
oh
all
right
why
is
he
called
that
heathen
name
kaviak
oh
it
the
name
of
his
tribe
his
people
belong
to
that
branch
of
the
innuits
known
as
kaviaks
humph
then
he
only
kaviak
as
i
maccann
i
suppose
christened
him
well
not
yet
no
what
shall
we
call
him
what
your
boy
name
robert
bruce
they
went
on
in
silence
till
mac
said
it
on
account
of
my
boy
i
came
up
here
oh
it
did
use
to
matter
if
a
man
poor
and
but
in
these
days
of
competition
it
different
a
boy
must
have
chances
if
he
going
to
fight
the
battle
on
equal
terms
of
course
some
boys
ai
worth
botherin
about
but
my
boy
well
he
seems
to
have
something
in
him
the
priest
listened
silently
but
with
that
look
of
brotherliness
on
his
face
that
made
it
so
easy
to
talk
to
him
it
does
really
matter
to
those
other
fellows
mac
jerked
his
hand
towards
the
camp
it
never
so
important
to
men
who
stand
alone
but
i
to
strike
it
rich
over
yonder
he
lifted
his
head
and
frowned
defiantly
in
the
general
direction
of
the
klondyke
thirteen
hundred
miles
away
it
my
one
chance
he
added
half
to
himself
it
means
everything
to
bob
and
me
education
scientific
education
costs
like
thunder
in
the
united
states
oh
i
mean
to
send
my
boy
to
the
old
country
i
want
bob
to
be
thorough
the
priest
smiled
but
almost
imperceptibly
how
old
is
he
oh
as
old
as
this
youngster
mac
spoke
with
calculated
indifference
six
or
thereabouts
no
four
and
a
half
but
he
bigger
of
course
and
you
can
see
already
he
got
a
lot
in
him
father
wills
nodded
with
a
conviction
that
brought
mac
nearer
confession
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
you
see
he
said
quite
low
and
as
if
the
words
were
dragged
out
with
pincers
the
fact
is
my
married
life
did
pan
out
very
well
and
i
ran
away
from
home
as
a
little
chap
after
a
lickin
and
never
went
back
but
there
one
thing
i
mean
to
make
a
success
of
that
my
boy
well
i
believe
you
will
if
you
feel
like
that
why
they
gone
clean
past
the
camp
trail
said
mac
sharply
all
but
nicholas
and
what
in
thunder
he
put
the
kid
back
on
the
sled
yes
i
told
my
men
we
be
getting
on
but
they
were
told
to
leave
you
the
venison
what
you
goin
straight
on
nonsense
mac
interrupted
and
began
to
shout
to
the
indians
no
i
to
stop
just
tell
your
friends
so
said
the
unsuspecting
father
but
with
a
sick
child
what
can
you
do
for
him
that
we
ca
and
to
break
the
journey
may
make
a
big
difference
we
got
some
condensed
milk
left
and
ah
yes
but
we
are
more
accustomed
to
it
hardly
fair
to
burden
a
neighbour
no
we
be
getting
on
if
those
fellers
up
there
make
a
row
about
your
bringing
in
a
youngster
he
thrust
out
his
jaw
they
can
settle
the
account
with
me
i
got
to
do
something
for
that
cough
before
the
kid
goes
on
well
said
the
priest
and
so
wily
are
these
jesuits
that
he
never
once
mentioned
that
he
was
himself
a
qualified
doctor
in
full
and
regular
practice
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
finished
stockade
and
the
great
chimney
wearing
majestically
its
floating
plume
of
smoke
hi
mac
called
between
his
hands
to
the
indians
who
had
gone
some
distance
ahead
hi
he
motioned
them
back
up
the
hill
trail
had
come
out
of
the
little
cabin
and
seemed
to
be
laboriously
trundling
something
along
the
footpath
he
got
so
excited
when
he
heard
the
noise
and
saw
the
party
that
inadvertently
he
let
his
burden
slide
down
the
icy
slope
bumping
and
bouncing
clumsily
from
one
impediment
to
another
faith
look
at
sure
that
fossle
ca
resthrain
his
at
seein

surprise
fur
ye
sure
more
surprised
to

leppin
down
the
hill
to
meet
ye
like
a
rale
irish
tarrier
mac
was
angry
and
did
conceal
the
fact
as
he
ran
to
stop
the
thing
before
it
should
be
dashed
to
pieces
the
priest
happened
to
glance
back
and
saw
coming
slowly
along
the
river
trail
a
solitary
figure
that
seemed
to
make
its
way
with
difficulty
it
looks
as
though
you
have
more
than
you
bargained
for
at
the
he
said
came
down
the
hill
babbling
like
a
brook
to

the
boy
has
come
back
called
out
mac
he
leaned
against
a
tuft
of
willow
banked
round
with
snow
and
turned
gloomily
as
if
to
go
back
down
the
river
again
who
this
they
all
stood
and
watched
the
limping
traveller
why
it
of
course
i
did
know
him
with
that
thing
tied
over
his
cap
and
mac
went
to
meet
him
the
boy
bettered
his
pace
how
did
i

the

looking

mischievous

piece

miles

when

and

i
kind
o

to
have
your
hands

rigid
and

cover
the
ground
like
you

what
the

o
that
elephant
there
was
no
more
said
till
they
got
up
to
the
others
who
had
waited
for
the
indians
to
come
back
and
had
unpacked
kaviak
to
spare
him
the
jolting
uphill
was
screaming
with
excitement
as
he
saw
that
the
bundle
nicholas
was
carrying
had
a
head
and
two
round
eyes
the
saints
in
glory
be
among
us
what

chapter
iv
the
how
good
it
is
to
invite
men
to
the
pleasant
feast
comfortable
as
rock
fireplace
and
stockade
made
the
cabin
now
the
colonel
had
been
feeling
all
that
morning
that
the
official
was
to
failure
nevertheless
as
he
was
cook
that
week
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
treat
altogether
lightly
his
office
of
master
of
the
feast
there
would
probably
be
no
guests
even
their
own
little
company
would
likely
be
incomplete
but
t
here
was
to
be
a
spread
that
afternoon
anyways
even
had
the
colonel
needed
any
keeping
up
to
the
mark
the
office
would
have
been
cheerfully
undertaken
by
or
by
potts
for
whom
interest
in
the
gustatory
aspect
of
the
occasion
was
wholly
undimmed
by
the
threatened
absence
of
mac
and
the
little
divvle
there
be
the
more
for
us
said
potts
enthusiastically
argument
seemed
to
halt
upon
a
reservation
he
looked
over
the
various
contributions
to
the
feast
set
out
on
a
board
in
front
of
the
and
it
mate
i
wishin
fur
says
he
we
got
fish
that
only
mate
on
fridays
we
had

divil
dance
on

rations
no
scurvy
in
this
camp
for
a
while
yet
said
the
colonel
throwing
some
heavy
objects
into
a
pan
and
washing
them
vigorously
round
and
round
pitaties
eyes
dwelt
lovingly
on
the
rare
food
hoarded
too
long
man
they
sprouted
that
wo
prevent
you
hoggin
more
your
share
i

said
potts
pleasantly
i
do
somehow
like
wasting
the
sprouts
observed
the
colonel
anxiously
it
such
a
wonderful
sight
something
growing
he
had
cut
one
pallid
slip
and
held
it
tenderly
between
knife
and
thumb
waste
with
scurvy
staring
us
in
the
face
should
think
not
mix
with
cold
potaters
in
a
salad
no
make
slumgullion
commanded
what
that
quoth
the
colonel
be

think
of
it
befure
arre

yes
well
well
an

sound
heady
enough
for
a
said
the
colonel
sober
up
on
slumgullion
anyhow
it
mate
i
wishin
fur
sighed
subsiding
among
the
what
the
good
o
the
little
divvle
and
his
thramps
if
he
ca
bring
home
a
burrud
or
so
much
as
the
scut
iv
a
rabbit
furr
the
soup
well
he
contributed
a
bottle
of
california
apricots
and
we
have
boiled
rice
an
punch
glory
be
answered
the
colonel
i
been
thinkin
a
good
deal
about
the
punch
so
myself
said
frankly
but
potts
looked
at
the
colonel
suspiciously
through
narrowed
eyes
there
very
little
whiskey
left
and
i
propose
to
brew
a
mild
bowl
to
hell
with
your
mild
bowls
a
good
enough
punch
sah
but
one
that
that
a
well
that
the
whole
kit
and
boodle
of
us
can
drink
indians
and
everybody
you
know
nicholas
and
andrew
may
turn
up
i
want
you
two
fellas
to
suppoht
me
about
this
there
are
reasons
foh
it
sah
he
had
laid
a
hand
on
potts
shoulder
and
fixed
with
his
eye
and
speaking
very
solemnly
yoh
neither
o
yoh
gentlemen
that
need
mo
said
on
the
subject
whereupon
having
cut
the
ground
from
under
their
feet
he
turned
decisively
and
stirred
the
with
a
magnificent
air
and
a
birch
stick
to
give
the
big
cabin
an
aspect
of
solid
luxury
they
had
spread
the
boy
old
buffalo
robe
on
the
floor
and
as
the
morning
wore
on
potts
and
made
one
or
two
expeditions
to
the
little
cabin
bringing
back
selections
out
of
mac
hoard
to
decorate
the
as
they
said
on
the
last
trip
potts
refused
to
accompany
his
pardner
no
it
was
no
good
mac
evidently
would
be
back
to
see
and
the
laugh
would
be
on
them
takin
so
much
trouble
for
nothin
and
was
to
be
long
either
for
dinner
had
been
absurdly
postponed
already
when
the
door
opened
the
next
time
it
was
to
admit
mac
nicholas
with
kaviak
in
his
arms
gesticulating
like
a
windmill
and
last
of
all
the
boy
kaviak
was
formally
introduced
but
instead
of
responding
to
his
attentions
the
only
thing
he
seemed
to
care
about
or
even
see
was
something
that
in
the
everybody
else
overlooked
the
decorations
mac
stuffed
birds
and
things
made
a
remarkably
good
show
but
the
colossal
success
was
reserved
for
the
minute
shrunken
skin
of
the
baby
white
hare
set
down
in
front
of
the
great
fire
for
a
hearthrug
if
the
others
failed
to
appreciate
that
joke
not
so
kaviak
he
gave
a
gurgling
cry
struggled
down
out
of
nicholas
arms
and
folded
the
white
hare
to
his
breast
where
are
the
other
indians
said
mac
looking
after
the
dogs
said
father
wills
and
as
the
door
opened
oh
yes
give
us
that
he
said
to
andrew
i
thought
he
turned
to
the
colonel
maybe
you
like
to
try
some
yukon
reindeer
hooray
mate
arre
ye
sayin
mate
or
is
an
angel
singin
now
i
that
man
a
christian
soliloquised
potts
look
here
it
take
a
little
time
to
cook
said
mac
and
worth
waitin
for
can
you
let
us
have
a
pail
o
hot
water
in
the
meantime
said
the
colonel
looking
as
if
he
had
enough
to
think
about
already
yes
we
always
wash
them
first
of
all
said
father
wills
noticing
how
mac
held
the
little
heathen
off
at
arm
length
nicholas
used
to
help
with
that
at
holy
cross
he
gave
the
new
order
with
the
old
authoritative
gesture
and
where
the
liniment
i
lent
you
that
you
so
generous
with
mac
arraigned
go
and
get
it
under
nicholas
hands
kaviak
was
forced
to
relinquish
not
only
the
baby
hare
but
his
own
elf
locks
he
was
closely
sheared
his
moccasins
put
off
and
his
single
garment
dragged
unceremoniously
wrong
side
out
over
his
head
and
bundled
out
of
doors
be
the
siven
he
got
as
manny
bones
as
a
skeleton
poor
little
codger
the
colonel
stood
an
instant
skillet
in
hand
staring
what
that
he
got
round
his
neck
said
the
boy
moving
nearer
kaviak
seeing
the
keen
look
menacing
his
treasure
lifted
a
shrunken
yellow
hand
and
clasped
tight
the
dirty
shapeless
object
suspended
from
a
necklace
nicholas
seemed
to
hesitate
to
divest
him
of
this
sole
remaining
possession
you
must
get
him
to
give
it
up
said
father
wills
and
burn
it
kaviak
flatly
declined
to
fall
in
with
as
much
as
he
understood
of
this
arrangement
what
is
it
anyway
the
boy
pursued
his
amulet
i
suppose
as
father
wills
proceeded
to
enforce
his
order
and
pulled
the
leather
string
over
the
child
head
kaviak
rent
the
air
with
shrieks
and
coughs
he
seemed
to
say
as
well
as
he
could
i
can
do
without
my
parki
and
my
mucklucks
but
i
take
my
death
without
my
amulet
mac
insinuated
himself
brusquely
between
the
victim
and
his
persecutors
he
took
the
dirty
object
away
from
the
priest
with
scant
ceremony
in
spite
of
the
whisper
infection
and
gave
it
back
to
the
wrathful
owner
you
talk
his
language
do
you
mac
demanded
of
nicholas
the
pymeut
pilot
nodded
tell
him
if
he
lend
the
thing
to
me
to
wash
he
shall
have
it
back
nicholas
explained
kaviak
with
streaming
eyes
and
quivering
lips
reluctantly
handed
it
over
and
watched
mac
anxiously
till
overwhelmed
by
a
yet
greater
misfortune
in
the
shape
of
a
bath
for
himself
how
shall
i
clean
this
thing
thoroughly
mac
condescended
to
ask
father
wills
the
priest
shrugged
he
have
forgotten
it
he
shall
have
it
said
mac
with
his
back
to
kaviak
the
boy
and
potts
crowding
round
him
mac
ripped
open
the
little
pouch
and
took
out
three
objects
an
ivory
mannikin
a
crow
feather
and
a
thing
that
father
wills
said
was
a
plug
what
it
for
same
as
the
rest
it
an
amulet
only
as
it
used
to
stop
the
flow
of
blood
from
the
wound
of
a
captive
seal
it
is
supposed
to
be
the
best
of
all
charms
for
anyone
who
spits
blood
i
clean
all
after
the
said
mac
and
he
went
out
buried
the
charms
in
the
snow
and
stuck
up
a
spruce
twig
to
mark
the
spot
meanwhile
to
poor
kaviak
it
was
being
plainly
demonstrated
what
an
awful
fate
descended
on
a
person
so
unlucky
as
to
part
with
his
amulet
he
stood
straight
up
in
the
bucket
like
a
in
a
cooler
and
he
could
not
have
resented
his
predicament
more
if
he
had
been
set
in
crushed
ice
instead
of
warm
water
under
the
remorseless
hands
of
nicholas
he
began
to
splutter
and
choke
to
fizz
and
finally
explode
with
astonishment
and
wrath
it
was
quite
clear
nicholas
was
trying
to
drown
him
he
took
the
treatment
so
to
heart
that
he
kept
on
howling
dismally
for
some
time
after
he
was
taken
out
and
dried
and
linimented
and
dosed
by
mac
whose
treachery
about
the
amulet
he
seemed
to
forgive
since
farva
had
had
the
air
of
rescuing
him
from
the
horrors
he
had
endured
in
that
where
for
all
kaviak
knew
he
might
have
stayed
till
he
succumbed
to
death
the
boy
contributed
a
shirt
of
his
own
and
helped
mac
to
put
it
on
the
incredibly
thin
little
figure
the
shirt
came
down
to
kaviak
heels
and
had
to
have
the
sleeves
rolled
up
every
two
minutes
but
by
the
time
the
was
nearly
done
kaviak
was
done
too
and
had
said
that
spissimen
does
ye
credit
mac
said
spissimen
was
now
staring
hungrily
out
of
the
colonel
bunk
holding
towards
mac
an
appealing
hand
with
half
a
yard
of
falling
over
it
mac
pretended
not
to
see
and
drew
up
to
the
table
the
one
remaining
available
thing
to
sit
on
his
back
to
his
patient
when
the
dogs
had
been
fed
and
the
other
indians
had
come
in
and
squatted
on
the
with
nicholas
the
first
course
was
sent
round
in
tin
cups
a
nondescript
but
warming
camp
soup
sorry
we
got
so
few
dishes
gentlemen
the
colonel
had
said
we
have
to
ask
some
of
you
to
wait
till
others
have
finished
farva
remarked
kaviak
leaning
out
of
the
bunk
and
sniffing
the
savoury
steam
he
takes
you
for
a
priest
said
potts
with
the
cheerful
intention
of
stirring
mac
bile
but
not
even
so
damning
a
suspicion
as
that
could
cool
the
collector
kindness
for
his
new
spissimen
you
come
here
he
said
kaviak
did
understand
the
boy
got
up
limped
over
to
the
bunk
lifted
the
child
out
and
brought
him
to
side
since
there
ai
enough
cups
said
mac
in
and
he
put
his
own
half
empty
to
kaviak
lips
the
spissimen
imbibed
greedily
audibly
and
beamed
mac
with
unimpaired
gravity
took
no
notice
of
the
huge
satisfaction
this
particular
remedy
was
giving
his
patient
except
to
say
solemnly
do
bubble
in
it
the
next
course
was
fish
a
la
pymeut
you
lucky
to
be
able
to
get
it
said
the
father
whether
with
suspicion
or
not
no
man
could
tell
i
had
to
send
back
for
some
by
a
trader
and
could
get
enough
we
did
see
any
trader
said
the
boy
to
divert
the
current
he
may
have
gone
by
in
the
dusk
he
was
travelling
hotfoot
thought
that
steamship
was
chockful
o
grub
what
did
you
want
fish
yes
they
got
plenty
of
food
but
they
do
relish
parting
with
it
suggested
potts
they
have
much
to
think
about
except
what
they
eat
they
wanted
to
try
our
fish
and
were
ready
to
exchange
i
promised
i
would
send
a
load
back
from
ikogimeut
if
they
he
seemed
not
to
care
to
finish
the
sentence
so
you
did
do
much
for
the
pymeuts
after
all
i
did
something
he
said
almost
shortly
then
with
recovered
serenity
he
turned
to
the
boy
i
promised
i
bring
back
any
news
yes
well
everybody
stopped
eating
and
hung
on
the
priest
words
captain
rainey
heard
there
a
big
new
strike
in
the
klondyke
on
the
american
side
this
time
hail
columbia
whereabouts
at
a
place
called
minook
where
that
up
the
river
by
the
ramparts
how
far
oh
a
little
matter
of
six
or
seven
hundred
miles
from
here
glory
to
god
might
as
well
be
six
or
seven
thousand
and
very
probably
is
a
strike
at
all
said
the
priest
but
just
a
stampede
a
very
different
matter
well
i
tell
you
straight
i
got
no
use
for
a
in
minook
at
this
time
o
year
nop
venison
steak
more
in
my
line
than
just
about
now
potts
had
to
bestir
himself
and
wash
dishes
before
he
could
indulge
in
his
line
when
the
grilled
reindeer
did
appear
flanked
by
potatoes
and
the
colonel
hot
kentucky
biscuit
there
was
no
longer
doubt
in
any
man
mind
but
what
this
was
being
a
success
colonel
a
daisy
cook
ai
he
the
boy
appealed
to
father
wills
the
jesuit
assented
cordially
my
family
meant
for
the
army
he
said
seen
much
service
colonel
the
kentuckian
laughed
never
wasted
a
day
soldiering
in
my
life
oh
maybe
you
wonderin
said
potts
why
he
a
colonel
the
jesuit
made
a
deprecatory
gesture
politely
disclaiming
any
such
rude
curiosity
he
from
kentucky
you
see
and
the
smile
went
round
beyond
that
we
ca
tell
you
why
he
a
colonel
unless
it
because
he
ai
a
judge
and
the
boss
of
the
camp
laughed
with
the
rest
for
the
denver
man
had
scored
by
the
time
they
got
to
the
california
apricots
and
boiled
rice
everybody
was
feeling
pretty
comfortable
when
at
last
the
table
was
cleared
except
for
the
basin
full
of
punch
and
when
all
available
cups
were
mustered
and
came
out
a
remarkably
genial
spirit
pervaded
the
company
with
three
exceptions
potts
and
waited
anxiously
to
sample
the
punch
before
giving
way
to
complete
satisfaction
and
kaviak
was
impervious
to
considerations
either
of
punch
or
conviviality
being
wrapped
in
slumber
on
a
corner
of
the
between
mac
stool
and
the
natives
who
also
occupied
places
on
the
floor
upon
first
draught
he
turned
to
his
next
neighbour
potts
me
bhoy
s
bad
i
bet
five
dollars
it
wo
make
yer
any
happier
begob
i
happy
enough
gentlemen
wud
ye
like
i
should
sing
ye
a
song
yes
yes
and
the
colonel
thumped
the
table
for
order
infinitely
relieved
that
the
dinner
was
done
and
the
punch
not
likely
to
turn
into
a
began
a
ditty
about
the
widdy
malone
that
woke
up
kaviak
and
made
him
rub
his
round
eyes
with
astonishment
he
sat
up
and
hung
on
to
the
back
of
mac
coat
to
make
sure
he
had
some
anchorage
in
the
strange
new
waters
he
had
so
suddenly
been
called
on
to
navigate
the
song
ended
the
colonel
as
proposed
the
health
of
he
was
going
to
say
father
wills
but
felt
it
discreeter
to
name
no
names
standing
up
in
the
middle
of
the
cabin
where
he
did
have
to
stoop
he
lifted
his
cup
till
it
knocked
against
the
and
called
out
here
to
our
visitors
neighbours
and
friends
whereupon
he
made
a
stately
circular
bow
which
ended
by
his
offering
kaviak
his
hand
in
the
manner
of
one
who
executes
a
figure
in
an
dance
the
smallest
of
our
visitors
still
keeping
hold
of
mac
presented
the
colonel
with
the
disengaged
of
flannel
undershirt
on
the
other
side
and
the
speech
went
on
very
flowery
very
hospitable
very
kentuckian
when
the
colonel
sat
down
there
was
much
applause
and
who
had
lent
his
cup
to
nicholas
and
did
feel
he
could
wait
till
it
came
back
began
to
drink
punch
out
of
the
dipper
between
shouts
of
hooray
brayvo
here
to
the
kurrnul
god
bless
him
that
rale
oratry
kurrnul
here
to
kentucky
and
ould
ireland
father
wills
stood
up
smiling
to
reply
friends
the
boy
thought
the
keen
eyes
rested
a
fraction
of
a
moment
longer
on
mac
than
on
the
rest
i
think
in
some
ways
this
is
the
pleasantest
i
ever
went
to
i
wo
take
up
time
thanking
the
colonel
for
the
friendly
sentiments
he
expressed
though
i
return
them
heartily
i
must
use
these
moments
you
are
good
enough
to
give
me
in
telling
you
something
of
what
i
feel
is
implied
in
the
founding
of
this
camp
of
yours
gentlemen
the
few
white
dwellers
in
the
yukon
country
have
not
looked
forward
his
eyes
twinkled
almost
wickedly
with
that
pleasure
you
might
expect
in
exiles
to
the
influx
of
people
brought
up
here
by
the
great
gold
discovery
we
knew
what
that
sort
of
craze
leads
to
we
knew
that
in
a
barren
land
like
this
more
and
more
denuded
of
wild
game
every
year
more
and
more
the
prey
of
epidemic
disease
we
knew
that
into
this
sorely
tried
and
hungry
world
would
come
a
horde
of
men
all
of
them
ignorant
of
the
conditions
up
here
most
of
them
with
proper
food
and
clothing
many
of
them
i
can
say
it
without
offence
in
this
company
many
of
them
men
whom
the
older
richer
communities
were
glad
to
get
rid
of
gentlemen
i
have
ventured
to
take
you
into
our
confidence
so
far
because
i
want
to
take
you
still
farther
to
tell
you
a
little
of
the
intense
satisfaction
with
which
we
recognise
that
good
fortune
has
sent
us
in
you
just
the
sort
of
neighbours
we
had
not
dared
to
hope
for
it
means
more
to
us
than
you
realise
when
i
heard
a
few
weeks
ago
that
in
addition
to
the
that
had
already
got
some
distance
up
the
river
beyond
holy
cross
going
to
dawson
oh
yes
klondyke
mad
they
be
there
before
us
boys
anyways
they
get
to
minook
the
jesuit
shook
his
head
it
is
so
certain
they
probably
made
only
a
couple
of
hundred
miles
or
so
before
the
yukon
went
to
sleep
then
if
grub
gives
out
they
be
comin
back
here
suggested
potts
small
doubt
of
it
agreed
the
priest
and
when
i
heard
there
were
parties
of
the
same
sort
stranded
at
intervals
all
along
the
lower
river
you
sure
he
nodded
and
when
father
orloff
of
the
russian
mission
told
us
that
he
was
already
having
trouble
with
the
two
big
rival
parties
frozen
in
the
ice
below
ikogimeut
gosh
wonder
if
any
of
were
on
our
ship
well
gentlemen
i
do
not
disguise
from
you
that
when
i
heard
of
the
large
amount
of
whiskey
the
small
amount
of
food
and
the
low
type
of
manners
brought
in
by
these
i
felt
my
fears
justified
such
men
do
work
do
contribute
anything
to
the
decent
social
life
of
the
community
do
build
cabins
like
this
when
i
came
down
on
the
ice
the
first
time
after
you
camped
and
i
looked
up
and
saw
your
solid
stone
chimney
he
glanced
at
mac
i
did
know
what
a
it
would
make
but
already
from
far
off
across
the
ice
and
snow
that
chimney
warmed
my
heart
gentlemen
the
fame
of
it
has
gone
up
the
river
and
down
the
river
father
orloff
is
coming
to
see
it
next
week
and
so
are
the
white
traders
from
anvik
and
andreiefsky
for
they
heard
there
nothing
like
it
in
the
yukon
of
course
i
know
that
you
gentlemen
have
not
come
to
settle
permanently
i
know
that
when
the
great
white
silence
as
they
call
the
long
winter
up
here
is
broken
by
the
thunder
of
the
ice
rushing
down
to
the
sea
you
like
the
rest
will
exchange
the
for
the
and
pass
out
of
our
ken
now
i
not
usually
prone
to
try
my
hand
at
prophecy
but
i
am
tempted
to
say
even
on
our
short
acquaintance
that
i
am
tolerably
sure
that
while
we
shall
be
willing
enough
to
spare
most
of
the
to
the
klondyke
we
shall
grudge
to
the
the
men
who
built
this
camp
and
warmed
this
cabin
his
eye
rested
reflectively
on
mac
i
do
wish
to
sit
down
leaving
an
impression
of
speaking
with
entire
lack
of
sympathy
of
the
impulse
that
brings
men
up
here
for
gold
i
believe
that
even
with
the
sort
in
the
two
camps
below
ikogimeut
drinking
quarrelling
and
making
trouble
with
the
natives
at
the
russian
mission
i
believe
that
even
with
them
the
gold
they
came
up
here
for
is
a
symbol
a
fetich
some
of
us
may
think
when
such
men
have
it
in
their
hands
they
feel
dimly
that
they
are
laying
tangible
hold
at
last
on
some
elusive
vision
of
happiness
that
has
hitherto
escaped
them
behind
each
man
braving
the
arctic
winter
up
here
is
some
hope
not
all
ignoble
some
devotion
not
all
unsanctified
behind
most
of
these
men
i
seem
to
see
a
wife
or
child
a
parent
or
some
dear
dream
that
gives
that
man
his
share
in
the
eternal
hope
friends
we
call
that
thing
we
look
for
by
different
names
but
we
are
all
seekers
after
treasure
all
here
have
turned
our
backs
on
home
and
comfort
hunting
for
the
great
reward
each
man
a
new
columbus
looking
for
the
new
world
some
of
us
looking
north
some
south
some
he
hesitated
the
briefest
moment
and
then
with
a
faint
smile
half
sad
half
triumphant
made
a
little
motion
of
his
head
some
of
us
looking
upwards
but
quickly
as
though
conscious
that
if
he
had
raised
the
moral
tone
of
the
company
he
had
not
raised
its
spirits
he
hurried
on
before
i
sit
down
gentlemen
just
one
word
more
i
must
congratulate
you
on
having
found
out
so
soon
not
only
the
wisdom
but
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
this
arctic
world
with
intelligent
eyes
and
learning
some
of
her
wonderful
lessons
it
is
so
that
now
the
hardest
work
is
finished
you
will
keep
up
your
spirits
and
avoid
the
disease
that
attacks
all
who
simply
eat
sleep
and
wait
for
the
ice
to
go
out
when
i
hear
cheechalkos
complaining
of
boredom
up
here
in
this
world
of
daily
miracles
i
think
of
the
native
boy
in
the
who
called
on
to
describe
the
progress
of
civilisation
said
those
days
men
had
as
many
wives
as
they
liked
and
that
was
called
polygamy
now
they
have
only
one
wife
and
that
called
monotony
while
howled
with
delight
the
priest
wound
up
gentlemen
if
we
find
monotony
up
here
it
not
the
country
fault
but
a
defect
in
our
own
civilisation
wherewith
he
sat
down
amid
cheers
now
colonel
is
mac
goin
to
recite
some
border
ballads
inquired
the
boy
or
will
he
make
a
speech
or
do
a
highland
fling
the
colonel
called
formally
upon
maccann
mac
was
no
sooner
on
his
legs
than
kaviak
determined
not
to
lose
his
grasp
of
the
situation
climbed
upon
the
stool
just
vacated
and
resumed
his
former
relations
with
the
friendly
everybody
laughed
but
mac
who
pretended
not
to
know
what
was
going
on
behind
his
back
gentlemen
he
began
harshly
with
the
air
of
one
about
to
launch
a
heavy
indictment
there
one
element
largely
represented
here
by
numbers
and
by
interests
he
turned
round
suddenly
toward
the
natives
and
almost
swung
kaviak
off
into
space
one
element
not
explicitly
referred
to
in
the
speeches
either
of
welcome
or
of
thanks
but
gentlemen
i
submit
that
these
hitherto
unrecognised
natives
are
our
real
hosts
and
a
word
about
them
wo
be
out
of
place
i
been
told
that
whether
in
alaska
greenland
or
british
america
they
call
themselves
which
means
human
beings
they
believed
no
doubt
that
they
were
the
only
ones
in
the
world
i
been
thinking
a
great
deal
about
these
esquimaux
of
late
hear
hear
about
their
origin
and
their
destiny
mac
was
beginning
to
enjoy
himself
the
boy
was
beginning
to
be
bored
and
to
drum
softly
with
his
fingers
now
gentlemen
buffon
says
that
the
poles
were
the
first
portions
of
the
earth
crust
to
cool
while
the
equator
and
even
the
tropics
of
cancer
and
of
capricorn
were
still
too
boiling
hot
to
support
life
up
here
in
the
arctic
regions
there
was
a
carboniferous
era
goin
on
where
the
coal
then
sneered
potts
it
bein
discovered
all
over
ask
him
indicating
father
wills
who
smiled
assent
tropical
forests
grew
where
there
are
glayshers
now
and
elephants
and
mastodons
began
life
here
jimminy
christmas
interrupted
the
boy
sitting
up
very
straight
is
that
buffer
you
quoted
a
good
authority
mac
snapped
out
defiantly
good
lord
then
the
garden
o
eden
was
up
here
hey
course
was
the
cradle
o
the
human
race
blow
the
ganges
blow
the
nile
it
was
our
yukon
that
saw
the
first
people
of
course
the
first
people
lived
in
the
first
place
got
ready
for
that
do
follow
read
your
bible
if
i
not
right
how
did
it
happen
there
were
men
here
when
the
north
was
first
discovered
sh
mac
got
the
floor
shut
up
but
the
boy
thumped
the
table
with
one
hand
and
arraigned
the
schoolmaster
with
the
other
now
mac
i
put
it
to
you
as
a
man
o
science
if
the
race
had
got
a
foothold
in
any
other
part
o
the
world
what
in
sam
hill
could
make
come
up
here
here
yes
tomfools
after
gold
they
never
dreamed
there
was
gold
no
the
only
thing
on
earth
that
could
make
men
stay
here
would
be
that
they
were
born
here
and
did
know
any
better
do
the
primitive
man
cling
to
his
home
no
matter
what
kind
o
hole
it
is
he
to
leave
it
and
these
first
men
up
here
why
it
plain
as
day
they
just
hung
on
things
gettin
worse
and
worse
and
colder
and
colder
and
some
said
as
the
old
men
we
laugh
at
say
at
home
climate
ai
what
it
was
when
i
was
a
boy
and
nobody
believed
but
everybody
began
to
dress
warmer
and
eat
fat
and
all
that
buffon
says
is
yes
and
they
invented
one
thing
after
another
to
meet
the
new
conditions
kaiaks
and
bidarras
and
harpoons
he
was
pouring
out
his
new
notions
at
the
fastest
express
rate
and
the
animals
that
could
stand
it
emigrated
and
those
that
stayed
behind
got
changed
dry
up
one
at
a
time
buffon
yes
yes
mac
and
the
hares
got
white
and
the
men
playin
a
game
for
centuries
got
dull
in
their
heads
and
stunted
in
their
legs
always
cramped
up
in
a
kaiak
like
those
fellas
at
michael
and
why
it
clear
as
crystal
they
survivals
the
esquimaux
are
the
oldest
race
in
the
world
who
makin
this
speech
order
order
well
see
here
you
admit
it
mac
do
you
see
there
were
just
a
few
enterprisin
ones
who
cleared
out
or
maybe
got
carried
away
in
a
current
and
found
better
countries
and
got
rich
and
civilised
and
became
our
forefathers
hey
boys
ai
i
right
you
sit
down
you
get
chucked
out
buffon
everybody
was
talking
at
once
why
it
goes
on
still
the
boy
roared
above
the
din
people
who
stick
at
home
and
are
patient
and
put
up
with
things
they
doomed
but
look
at
the
fellas
that
come
out
o
starvin
attics
and
pigsties
to
america
they
live
like
lords
and
they
look
at
life
like
men
mac
was
saying
a
great
deal
about
the
ice
age
and
the
first
and
second
periods
of
glaciation
but
nobody
could
hear
what
nicholas
well
i
should
smile
he
belongs
to
the
oldest
family
in
the
world
the
boy
jumped
up
on
his
stool
and
cracked
his
head
against
the
roof
but
he
only
ducked
rubbed
his
wild
long
hair
till
it
stood
out
wilder
than
ever
and
went
on
forefathers
were
kings
before
caesar
they
were
here
before
the
pyramids
the
colonel
came
round
and
hauled
the
boy
down
potts
was
egging
the
miscreant
on
poorly
disguising
his
delight
in
a
scrimmage
had
been
shouting
ye
spoil
the
ye
meddlin
jackass
ca
ye
let
mac
make
his
spache
no
ye
must
ahlways
be
huntin
round
fur
harrum
to
be
doin
or
throuble
to
make
in
the
turmoil
and
the
contending
of
many
voices
nicholas
began
to
explain
to
his
friends
that
it
was
a
real
fight
as
it
had
every
appearance
of
being
and
the
visitors
were
in
no
immediate
danger
of
their
lives
but
kaviak
feared
the
worst
and
began
to
weep
forlornly
the
world
is
dyin
at
top
and
bottom
screamed
the
boy
writhing
under
the
colonel
clutch
the
ice
will
spread
the
beasts
will
turn
white
and
we
turn
yella
and
we
all
dress
in
skins
and
eat
fat
and
be
exactly
like
kaviak
and
the
last
man
be
found
tryin
to
warm
his
hands
at
the
equator
his
feet
on
an
iceberg
and
his
nose
in
a
snowstorm
your
old
buffer
got
a
long
head
mac
here
to
buffer
whereupon
he
subsided
and
drank
freely
of
punch
well
said
the
colonel
severely
you
had
a
if
nobody
else
has
feel
better
inquired
potts
tenderly
now
mac
you
shall
have
a
fair
field
said
the
colonel
and
if
the
boy
opens
his
trap
again
i
punch
promised
replenishing
the
disturber
cup
but
mac
would
be
drawn
besides
he
was
feeding
kaviak
so
the
colonel
filled
in
the
breach
with
my
old
kentucky
home
which
he
sang
with
much
feeling
if
not
great
art
this
performance
restored
harmony
and
a
gentle
reflectiveness
father
wills
told
about
his
journey
up
here
ten
years
before
and
of
a
further
expedition
he
once
made
far
north
to
the
koyukuk
but
nicholas
knows
more
about
the
native
life
and
legends
than
anyone
i
ever
met
except
of
course
yagorsha
who
yag
began
the
boy
oh
that
the
village
he
was
about
to
speak
of
something
else
but
lifting
his
eyes
he
caught
mac
sudden
glance
of
grudging
attention
the
priest
looked
away
and
went
on
there
a
in
every
settlement
he
has
always
been
a
great
figure
in
the
native
life
i
believe
but
now
more
than
ever
why
that
oh
battles
are
over
and
are
done
but
the
need
for
a
abides
in
most
villages
he
is
a
bigger
man
than
the
chief
they
all
chiefs
the
few
that
are
left
and
when
they
die
there
will
be
no
more
so
the
tribal
comes
to
be
the
most
important
character
the
jesuit
smiled
in
that
shrewd
and
gentle
way
of
his
that
is
of
course
after
the
sham√°n
as
the
russians
call
him
the
who
is
a
teller
of
stories
too
in
his
more
circumscribed
fashion
but
it
the
who
helps
his
people
through
the
long
winter
helps
them
to
face
the
terrible
new
enemies
epidemic
disease
and
famine
he
has
always
been
their
best
defence
against
that
dread
they
all
have
of
the
dark
yes
no
one
better
able
to
send
such
foes
flying
than
yagorsha
of
pymeut
still
nicholas
is
a
good
second
the
prince
of
pymeut
shook
his
head
tell
them
white
crow
last
flight
urged
the
priest
but
nicholas
was
not
in
the
vein
and
when
they
all
urged
him
overmuch
he
in
pulled
a
knife
out
of
his
pocket
and
a
bit
of
walrus
ivory
about
the
size
of
his
thumb
and
fell
to
carving
what
you
makin
button
says
nicholas
me
heap
hurry
get
him
done
it
looks
more
like
a
bird
than
a
button
remarked
the
boy
him
bird
him
button
replied
the
imperturbable
one
half
the
of
the
north
has
to
do
with
the
crow
or
raven
the
priest
went
on
seeing
kaviak
feather
reminded
me
of
a
native
that
a
kind
of
a
story
too
it
been
roughly
translated
can
you
say
it
i
used
to
know
how
it
went
he
began
in
a
deep
voice

of

home
who
the
sham√°n
the
boy
inquired
ah
better

nicholas
answered
the
priest
but
nicholas
was
absorbed
in
his
carving
again
obliged
roaring
with
great
satisfaction
a
stout
rovin
blade
and
what
matther
my
name
for

ahlways

lo
potts
was
called
on
no
he
could
sing
but
he
could
show
them
a
trick
or
two
and
with
his
grimy
he
kept
his
word
showing
that
he
was
not
the
mere
but
the
magician
of
the
party
the
natives
who
know
the
cards
as
we
know
our
a
b
c
were
enthralled
and
began
to
look
upon
potts
as
a
creature
of
more
than
mortal
skill
again
the
boy
pressed
nicholas
to
dance
no
no
and
under
his
breath
you
come
pymeut
meanwhile
hugging
the
pleasant
consciousness
that
he
had
distinguished
himself
his
pardner
too
complained
that
the
only
contribution
mac
or
the
boy
had
made
was
to
kick
up
a
row
what
steps
were
they
going
to
take
to
retrieve
their
characters
and
minister
to
the
public
entertainment
i
supplied
the
decorations
said
mac
in
a
final
tone
well
and
the
bhoy
what
good
arre
ye
annyway
hard
to
say
said
the
person
addressed
but
thinking
hard
would
you
like
to
see
me
wag
my
ears
some
languid
interest
was
manifested
in
this
accomplishment
but
it
fell
rather
flat
after
potts
splendid
achievements
with
the
no
ye
ai
good
fur
much
as
an
enthertainer
said
frankly
kaviak
had
begun
to
cry
for
more
punch
and
mac
was
evidently
growing
a
good
deal
perplexed
as
to
the
further
treatment
for
his
patient
did
ye
be
tellin
some
wan
father
that
when
ye
found
that
esquimer
he
had
grass
stuffed
in
his
mouth
sure
he
be
missin
that
grass
ram
somethin
down
his
throat
was
it
done
to
shorten
his
sufferings
the
colonel
asked
in
an
undertone
no
answered
the
priest
in
the
same
low
voice
if
they
listen
long
to
the
dying
the
cry
gets
fixed
in
their
imagination
and
they
hear
it
after
the
death
and
think
the
spirit
haunts
the
place
their
fear
and
horror
of
the
dead
is
beyond
belief
they
turn
a
dying
man
out
of
his
own
house
and
not
by
the
door
but
through
a
hole
in
the
roof
or
they
pull
out
a
log
to
make
an
opening
closing
it
up
quick
so
the
spirit
wo
find
his
way
back
kaviak
continued
to
lament
sorry
we
ca
offer
you
some
blubber
kaviak
that
he
missin
he
got
an
inexhaustible
store
of
his
own
his
mistake
is
offerin
it
to
us
i
know
what
the
matter
with
that
little
shaver
said
the
boy
he
has
got
any
stool
and
you
keep
him
standin
on
those
legs
of
his
like
matches
let
him
sit
on
the
there
said
mac
gruffly
do
you
he
thought
o
the
but
he
hate
it
a
little
fella
likes
to
be
up
where
he
can
see
what
goin
on
he
feel
as
lost
down
there
on
the
buffalo
as
a
puppy
in
a
the
boy
was
standing
up
looking
round
i
know
elephas
come
along
jimmie
in
spite
of
remonstrance
they
rushed
to
the
door
and
dragged
in
the
fossle
when
nicholas
and
his
friends
realised
what
was
happening
they
got
up
grunting
and
protesting
lend
a
hand
andrew
the
boy
called
to
the
man
nearest
no
no
objected
the
true
son
of
the
church
with
uncommon
fervour
you
then
nicholas
oo
ha
no
touch
no
touch
what
up
you
do
know
what
this
is
huh
nicholas
know
plenty
well
nicholas
no
touch
bones
of
dead
devils
this
view
of
the
fossle
so
delighted
the
company
that
acting
on
a
sudden
impulse
they
pushed
the
out
of
the
way
and
with
a
whoop
hoisted
the
huge
thing
on
the
table
then
the
boy
seized
the
whimpering
kaviak
and
set
him
high
on
the
throne
so
surprised
was
the
topmost
spissimen
that
he
was
as
quiet
for
a
moment
as
the
one
underneath
him
staring
about
blinking
then
looking
down
at
mac
he
remembered
his
grievance
and
took
up
the
wail
where
he
had
left
it
off
nuh
nuh
do
you
do
that
said
the
boy
with
startling
suddenness
if
you
make
that
noise

to
make
a
worse
one
if
you
cry
kaviak
i
have
to
sing

do
you
do

and
as
kaviak
in
spite
of
instructions
began
to
bawl
the
boy
began
to
do
a
plantation
jig
crooning
monotonously
on
de
swee
vine
swee

swee

grasshoppah
he
stopped
as
suddenly
as
he
begun
will
you
be
good
kaviak
drew
a
breath
with
a
catch
in
it
looked
round
and
began
as
firmly
as
ever
weh
eh
eh
sh
sh
the
boy
clapped
his
hands
and
lugubriously
intoned

besides
i

with

they
did
the
impossible
they
made
room
and
turned
back
the
only
the
big
colonel
who
was
most
in
the
way
of
all
sat
not
stirring
staring
in
the
fire
such
a
look
on
the
absent
tender
face
as
the
great
masters
the
divinest
poets
can
not
often
summon
but
which
comes
at
the
call
of
some
foolish
old
nursery
jingle
some
fragment
of
heard
when
the
world
was
young
when
all
hearing
was
music
when
all
sight
was
pictures
when
every
sense
brought
marvels
that
seemed
the
everyday
way
of
the
wonderful
wonderful
world
for
an
obvious
reason
it
is
not
through
the
utterances
of
the
greatest
that
the
child
receives
his
first
intimations
of
the
beauty
and
the
mystery
of
things
these
come
in
lowly
guise
with
familiar
everyday
voices
but
their
eloquence
has
the
incommunicable
grace
of
infancy
the
promise
of
the
first
dawn
the
menace
of
the
first
night
do
you
remember
the
thing
about
the
and
the
weather
signs
said
the
colonel
roused
at
last
by
the
jig
on
his
toes
and
the
rattle
of
improvised
bones

his
face

undoubtedly
liked
that
part
of
the
entertainment
that
involved
the
breakdown
infinitely
the
best
of
all
but
simultaneously
at
its
wildest
moment
they
all
turned
their
heads
to
the
door
mac
noticed
the
movement
listened
and
then
got
up
lifted
the
latch
and
cautiously
looked
out
the
boy
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
sky
over
mac
shoulder
jimminy
christmas
he
stopped
nearly
breathless
it
ca
be
a
fire
say
boys
they
havin
a
up
in
heaven
the
company
crowded
out
the
sky
was
full
of
a
palpitant
light
an
indian
appeared
from
round
the
stockade
he
was
still
staring
up
at
the
stone
chimney
are
we
on
fire
he
handed
father
wills
a
piece
of
dirty
paper
hah
yes
all
right
andrew
andrew
needed
no
more
he
bustled
away
to
harness
the
dogs
the
white
men
were
staring
up
at
the
sky
what
goin
on
in
heaven
father
you
call
this
the
aurora
borealis
hey
yes
said
the
priest
and
finer
than
we
often
get
it
we
are
not
far
enough
north
for
the
great
displays
he
went
in
to
put
on
his
parki
mac
after
looking
out
had
shut
the
door
and
stayed
behind
with
kaviak
on
father
will
return
farva
speaking
apparently
less
to
the
priest
than
to
the
floor
muttered
better
let
him
stop
where
he
is
till
his
cold
better
the
colonel
came
in
leave
the
child
here
ejaculated
the
till
he
better
able
to
travel
why
not
said
the
colonel
promptly
well
it
would
be
a
kindness
to
keep
him
a
few
days
i
to
travel
fast
tonight
then
it
settled
mac
bundled
kaviak
into
the
boy
bunk
when
the
others
were
ready
to
go
out
again
farva
caught
up
his
fur
coat
and
went
along
with
them
the
dogs
were
not
quite
ready
the
priest
was
standing
a
little
absentmindedly
looking
up
the
pale
green
streamers
were
fringed
with
the
tenderest
rose
colour
and
from
the
corona
uniting
them
at
the
zenith
they
shot
out
across
the
heavens
with
a
rapid
circular
and
lateral
motion
paling
one
moment
flaring
up
again
the
next
wonder
what
makes
it
said
the
colonel
electricity
mac
snapped
out
promptly
the
priest
smiled
one
mystery
for
another
he
turned
to
the
boy
and
they
went
on
together
preceding
the
others
a
little
on
the
way
down
the
trail
towards
the
river
i
think
you
must
come
and
see
us
at
holy
cross
eh
come
soon
and
then
without
waiting
for
an
answer
the
indians
think
these
flitting
lights
are
the
souls
of
the
dead
at
play
but
yagorsha
says
that
long
ago
a
great
chief
lived
in
the
north
who
was
a
mighty
hunter
it
was
always
summer
up
here
then
and
the
big
chief
chased
the
big
game
from
one
end
of
the
year
to
another
from
mountain
to
mountain
and
from
river
to
sea
he
killed
the
biggest
moose
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
and
caught
whales
with
his
crooked
thumb
for
a
hook
one
long
day
in
summer
he
had
a
tremendous
chase
after
a
wonderful
bird
and
he
came
home
without
it
deadbeat
and
out
of
temper
he
lay
down
to
rest
but
the
sunlight
never
winked
and
the
unending
glare
maddened
him
he
rolled
and
tossed
and
roared
as
only
the
yukon
roars
when
the
ice
rushes
down
to
the
sea
but
he
could
sleep
then
in
an
awful
fury
he
got
up
seized
the
day
in
his
great
hands
tore
it
into
little
bits
and
tossed
them
high
in
the
air
so
it
was
dark
and
winter
fell
on
the
world
for
the
first
time
during
months
and
months
just
to
punish
this
great
crime
there
was
no
bright
sunshine
but
often
in
the
long
night
while
the
chief
was
wearying
for
summer
to
come
again
he
be
tantalised
by
these
little
bits
of
the
broken
day
that
flickered
in
the
sky
coming
andrew
he
called
back
the
others
trooped
dogs
sleds
and
all
there
was
a
great
and
nicholas
whispered
you
come
pymeut
i
should
just
pretty
nearly
think
i
would
you
dance
heap
good
buttons
no
all
done
he
put
four
little
ivory
crows
into
the
boy
hands
they
were
rudely
but
cleverly
carved
with
eyes
outlined
in
ink
and
supplied
under
the
breast
with
a
neat
shank
mighty
fine
the
boy
examined
them
by
the
strange
glow
that
brightened
in
the
sky
you
keep
oh
no
ca
do
that
nicholas
spoke
peremptorily
yukon
men
have
big
feast
must
bring
present
me
no
got
reindeer
me
got
button
he
grinned
and
the
last
of
the
guests
went
his
way
it
was
only
habit
that
kept
the
colonel
toasting
by
the
fire
before
he
turned
in
for
the
cabin
was
as
warm
as
the
south
in
grasshoppah
on
a
swee
vine
the
boy
droned
sleepily
as
he
untied
the
leathern
thongs
that
kept
up
his
muckluck
legs
swee
vine
swee
all
those
othahs
the
colonel
waved
a
hand
in
the
direction
of
pymeut
i
think
we
dreamed
boy
you
and
me
playing
the
big
game
with
fohtune
foolishness
klondyke
yoh
crazy
tell
me
the
hard
as
iron
and
the
snow
up
to
the
windah
don
a
wo
of
it
we
on
some
plantation
boy
down
south
in
the
niggah
quawtaws
the
boy
was
turning
back
the
covers
and
balancing
a
moment
on
the
side
of
the
bunk
on
a
swee
vine
swee
great
caesar
ghost
he
jumped
up
and
stood
staring
down
at
the
sleeping
kaviak
ah
a
did
you
know
he
been
left
behind
for
a
few
days
yes
i
can
see
he
left
behind
no
colonel
i
reckon
we
in
the
arctic
regions
all
right
when
it
comes
to
catchin
esquimers
in
your
bed
he
pulled
the
furs
over
kaviak
and
himself
and
curled
down
to
sleep
chapter
v
the
sham√°n
for
my
part
i
have
ever
believed
and
do
now
know
that
there
are
witches
the
boy
had
hoped
to
go
to
pymeut
the
next
day
but
his
feet
refused
to
carry
him
mac
took
a
diagram
and
special
directions
and
went
after
the
rest
of
elephas
conveying
the
few
clumsy
relics
home
bit
by
bit
with
a
devotion
worthy
of
a
pious
pilgrim
for
three
days
the
boy
growled
and
played
games
with
kaviak
going
about
at
first
chiefly
on
hands
and
knees
on
the
fifth
day
after
the
you
comin
long
to
pymeut
this
mornin
he
asked
the
colonel
what
the
rush
good
lord
it
a
week
since
they
were
here
and
stopped
snowin
and
has
thought
of
sleetin
yet
or
anything
else
rambunksious
come
on
colonel
but
father
wills
had
shown
the
colonel
the
piece
of
dirty
paper
the
indian
had
brought
on
the
night
of
the
threatened
pymeuts
think
old
chief
dying
not
of
consumption
but
of
a
devil
they
sent
a
dogteam
to
bring
the
sham√°n
down
over
the
ice
come
reckon
we
better
hold
our
horses
till
we
hear
from
holy
cross
hear
what
the
colonel
did
answer
but
the
boy
did
wait
to
listen
he
swallowed
his
coffee
scalding
hot
rolled
up
some
food
and
stuff
for
trading
in
a
light
reindeer
skin
blanket
lashed
it
packwise
on
his
back
shouldered
his
gun
and
made
off
before
the
trio
came
in
to
breakfast
the
first
sign
that
he
was
nearing
a
settlement
was
the
appearance
of
what
looked
like
sections
of
rude
wicker
fencing
set
up
here
and
there
in
the
river
and
frozen
fast
in
the
ice
high
on
the
bank
lay
one
of
the
long
basket
and
presently
he
caught
sight
of
something
in
the
bleak
arctic
landscape
that
made
his
heart
jump
something
that
to
florida
eyes
looked
familiar
why
if
it
does
make
me
think
of
john
fox
cabin
on
cypress
creek
he
said
to
himself
formulating
an
impression
that
had
vaguely
haunted
him
on
the
lower
river
in
september
wondering
if
the
yukon
flooded
like
the
caloosahatchee
and
if
the
water
could
reach
as
far
up
as
all
that
he
stopped
to
have
a
good
look
at
this
first
one
of
the
pymeut
caches
for
this
modest
edifice
like
a
noah
ark
on
four
legs
was
not
a
habitation
but
a
storehouse
and
was
perched
so
high
not
for
fear
of
floods
but
for
fear
of
dogs
and
mice
this
was
manifest
from
the
fact
that
there
were
and
even
ighloos
much
nearer
the
river
the
boy
stopped
and
hesitated
it
was
a
sore
temptation
to
climb
up
and
see
what
they
had
in
that
cache
there
was
an
inviting
plank
all
ready
with
sticks
nailed
on
it
transversely
to
prevent
the
feet
from
slipping
but
the
boy
stopped
at
the
rude
ladder
foot
deciding
that
this
particular
mark
of
interest
on
the
part
of
a
stranger
might
be
misinterpreted
it
would
perhaps
be
prudent
to
find
nicholas
first
of
all
but
where
was
nicholas
where
was
anybody
the
scattered
huts
were
more
like
some
with
propped
against
the
front
face
looking
riverwards
while
he
was
cogitating
how
to
effect
an
entrance
to
one
of
these
or
to
make
his
presence
known
he
saw
to
his
relief
the
back
of
a
solitary
indian
going
in
the
direction
of
an
ighloo
farther
up
the
river
hi
hi
he
shouted
and
as
the
figure
turned
he
made
signs
it
stopped
the
boy
called
out
when
he
got
nearer
you
talk
english
the
native
laughed
a
flash
of
fine
teeth
and
sparkling
eyes
lit
up
a
young
face
this
boy
seemed
promising
how
d
do
you
know
nicholas
yes
the
laugh
was
even
gayer
it
seemed
to
be
a
capital
joke
to
know
nicholas
where
is
he
the
figure
turned
and
pointed
and
then
come
i
show
you
this
was
a
more
highly
educated
person
than
nicholas
thought
the
visitor
remarking
the
use
of
the
nominative
scorned
of
the
prince
they
walked
on
to
the
biggest
of
the
underground
dwellings
is
this
where
the
king
hangs
out
nicholas
father
lives
here
no
this
is
the
kazhga
oh
the
kachime
ai
you
comin
in
oh
no
why
his
guide
had
a
fit
of
laughter
and
then
turned
to
go
say
what
your
name
the
answer
sounded
like
muckluck
and
just
then
nicholas
crawled
out
of
the
opening
leading
into
the
he
jumped
up
beaming
at
the
sight
of
his
friend
say
nicholas
who
this
fella
that
always
laughing
no
matter
what
you
say
calls
himself
the
individual
referred
to
gave
way
to
another
spasm
of
merriment
which
infected
nicholas
my
sister
this
one
he
explained
the
boy
joined
in
the
laugh
and
pulled
off
his
arctic
cap
with
a
bow
borrowed
straight
from
the
colonel
princess
muckluck
i
proud
to
know
you
name
no
muckluck
began
nicholas
name
mahk
mac
nonsense
mac
a
man
name
she
princess
muckluck
only
how
a
fella
to
tell
when
you
dress
her
like
a
man
the
princess
still
giggled
while
her
brother
explained
no
like
man
see
he
showed
how
the
skirt
of
her
deerskin
parki
reaching
like
her
brother
a
little
below
the
knee
was
shaped
round
in
front
and
nicholas
own
all
men
parkis
were
cut
straight
across
i
see
how
your
father
nicholas
looked
grave
even
princess
muckluck
stopped
laughing
come
said
nicholas
and
the
boy
followed
him
on
all
fours
into
the
kachime
entering
on
his
stomach
he
found
himself
in
a
room
about
sixteen
by
twenty
feet
underground
chinked
with
moss
a
roof
of
poles
sloping
upwards
but
leaving
an
opening
in
the
middle
for
a
some
three
feet
square
and
covered
at
present
by
a
piece
of
thin
translucent
skin
with
the
sole
exception
of
the
the
whole
thing
was
so
covered
with
earth
and
capped
with
snow
that
expecting
a
mere
cave
one
was
surprised
at
the
within
the
boy
was
still
more
surprised
at
the
concentration
there
of
malignant
smells
he
gasped
and
was
for
getting
out
again
as
fast
as
possible
when
the
bearskin
flap
fell
behind
him
over
the
kachime
end
of
the
through
the
and
the
stifling
air
he
saw
vaguely
a
grave
gathering
of
bucks
sitting
or
rather
lounging
and
squatting
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
wide
that
ran
all
round
the
room
about
a
foot
and
a
half
from
the
floor
their
solemn
intent
faces
were
lit
grotesquely
by
the
uncertain
glow
of
two
lamps
mounted
on
two
posts
planted
one
in
front
of
the
right
the
other
on
the
left
the
boy
hesitated
was
it
possible
he
could
get
used
to
the
atmosphere
certainly
it
was
warm
in
here
though
there
was
no
fire
that
he
could
see
nicholas
was
talking
away
very
rapidly
to
the
grave
and
reverend
signiors
they
punctuating
his
discourse
with
occasional
grunts
and
a
continuous
coughing
nicholas
wound
up
in
english
me
tell
you
he
heap
good
friend
you
ketch
um
tobacco
he
inquired
suddenly
of
his
guest
fortunately
the
boy
had
remembered
to
ketch
that
essential
and
his
little
offering
was
laid
before
the
more
grunts
and
room
made
for
the
visitor
on
the
next
the
post
that
supported
one
of
the
lamps
a
clay
saucer
of
in
which
a
burning
wick
of
twisted
moss
gave
forth
a
powerful
odour
a
fair
amount
of
smoke
and
a
faint
light
the
boy
sat
down
still
staring
about
him
taking
note
of
the
logs
and
of
the
neat
attachment
of
the
timbers
by
a
at
the
four
corners
of
the
roof
who
built
this
he
inquired
of
nicholas
ol
father
an
heap
ol
men
gone
dead
gee
well
whoever
did
it
was
on
to
his
job
he
said
i
do
seen
a
nail
in
the
whole
sheebang
no
no
nail
the
boy
remembered
nicholas
sled
and
looking
again
at
the
disproportionately
small
hands
of
the
men
about
him
corrected
his
first
impression
that
they
were
too
feminine
to
be
good
for
much
a
dirty
old
fellow
weak
and
sickly
in
appearance
began
to
talk
querulously
all
the
others
listened
with
respect
smoking
and
making
inarticulate
noises
now
and
then
when
that
discourse
was
finished
a
fresh
one
was
begun
by
yet
another
coughing
councillor
what
it
all
about
the
boy
asked

the
buck

they
all
shook
their
heads
and
coughed
despairingly
then
try
s
other
some
esquimaux
kind
hazarded
the
boy
lightly
hardly
noticing
what
he
was
saying
till
he
found
nearly
all
the
eyes
of
the
company
fixed
intently
upon
him
nicholas
was
translating
and
it
was
clear
the
boy
had
created
a
sensation

no
no
they
sha
hear
through
me
i
safe
presently
they
all
got
up
and
began
removing
and
setting
back
the
hewn
logs
that
formed
the
middle
of
the
floor
it
then
appeared
that
underneath
was
an
excavation
about
two
feet
deep
in
the
centre
within
a
circle
of
stones
were
the
charred
remains
of
a
fire
and
here
they
proceeded
to
make
another
as
soon
as
it
began
to
blaze
yagorsha
the
took
the
cover
off
the
so
the
company
was
not
quite
stifled
a
further
diversion
was
created
by
several
women
crawling
in
bringing
food
for
the
in
old
or
native
wooden
kantaks
these
vessels
they
deposited
by
the
fire
and
with
an
exchange
of
grunts
went
out
as
they
had
come
nicholas
would
let
the
boy
undo
his
pack
no
we
come
back
he
said
adding
something
in
his
own
tongue
to
the
company
and
then
crawled
out
followed
by
the
boy
their
progress
was
slow
for
the
boy
canadian
webfeet
had
been
left
in
the
kachime
and
he
sank
in
the
snow
at
every
step
twice
in
the
dusk
he
stumbled
over
an
ighloo
or
a
sled
or
some
sign
of
humanity
and
asked
of
the
now
silent
preoccupied
nicholas
who
lives
here
the
answer
had
been
nobody
all
dead
the
boy
was
glad
to
see
approaching
at
last
a
human
figure
it
came
shambling
through
the
snow
with
bent
head
and
swaying
jerking
gait
looked
up
suddenly
and
sheered
off
flitting
uncertainly
onward
in
the
dim
light
like
a
frightened
ghost
who
is
that
sham√°n
him
see
in
dark
all
same
owl
him
know
you
white
man
the
boy
stared
after
him
the
bent
figure
of
the
sham√°n
looked
like
a
huge
bat
flying
low
hovering
disappearing
into
the
night
those
your
dogs
howling
the
visitor
asked
thinking
that
for
sheer
dismalness
pymeut
would
be
hard
to
beat
nicholas
stopped
suddenly
and
dropped
down
the
ground
seemed
to
open
and
swallow
him
the
boy
stooped
and
saw
his
friend
feet
disappearing
in
a
hole
he
seized
one
of
them
hold
on
wait
for
me
nicholas
kicked
but
to
no
purpose
he
could
make
only
such
progress
as
his
guest
permitted
presently
a
gleam
nicholas
had
thrust
away
the
flap
at
the
end
and
they
stood
in
the
house
of
the
chief
of
the
pymeuts
that
native
of
whom
father
wills
had
said
he
is
the
richest
and
most
intelligent
man
of
his
tribe
the
single
room
seemed
very
small
after
the
spaciousness
of
the
kachime
but
it
was
the
biggest
ighloo
in
the
settlement
a
fire
burnt
brightly
in
the
middle
of
the
earthen
floor
and
over
it
was
bending
princess
muckluck
cooking
the
evening
meal
she
nodded
and
her
white
teeth
shone
in
the
blaze
over
in
the
corner
wrapped
in
skins
lay
a
man
on
the
floor
groaning
faintly
the
salmon
toasting
on
sticks
over
wood
coals
smelt
very
appetising
why
your
fish
are
whole
do
you
clean
first
asked
the
visitor
surprised
out
of
his
manners
no
said
nicholas
him
better
no
cut
they
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
the
princess
waited
on
them
the
boy
discovered
that
it
was
perfectly
true
yukon
salmon
broiled
in
their
skins
over
a
birch
fire
are
the
finest
eating
in
the
world
and
any
other
way
involves
a
loss
of
flavour
he
was
introduced
for
the
first
time
to
the
delights
of
reindeer
and
found
even
that
not
so
bad
you
are
lucky
nicholas
to
have
a
sister
such
a
nice
one
too
the
princess
giggled
to
keep
house
for
you
nicholas
understood
at
least
that
politeness
was
being
offered
and
he
grinned
i
got
a
sister
myself
i
show
you
her
picture
some
day
i
care
about
her
a
lot
i
come
up
here
to
make
a
pile
so
that
we
can
buy
back
our
old
place
in
florida
he
said
this
chiefly
to
the
princess
for
she
evidently
had
profited
more
by
her
schooling
and
understood
things
quite
like
a
christian
did
you
ever
eat
an
orange
princess
he
continued
kind
o
fish
no
fruit
a
yella
ball
that
grows
on
a
tree
me
know
said
nicholas
me
see
him
in
boxes
michael
him
bully
yes
well
we
had
a
lot
of
trees
all
full
of
those
yella
balls
and
we
used
to
eat
as
many
as
we
liked
we
do
have
much
winter
down
where
i
live
summer
pretty
nearly
all
the
time
i
like
go
there
said
the
girl
well
will
you
come
and
see
us
muckluck
when
i
found
a
and
have
bought
back
the
orange
grove
my
sister
and
me
are
goin
to
live
together
like
you
and
nicholas
she
look
like
you
no
and
it
funny
too
we
twins
twins
what
twins
two
people
born
at
the
same
time
no
ejaculated
nicholas
why
yes
and
they
always
care
a
heap
about
each
other
when
twins
but
muckluck
stared
incredulously
at
the
same
time
she
exclaimed
it
like
that
then
in
your
country
the
boy
saw
not
astonishment
alone
but
something
akin
to
disgust
in
the
face
of
the
princess
he
felt
vaguely
he
must
justify
his
twinship
of
course
there
nothing
strange
about
it
it
happens
quite
often
yes
people
are
very
much
pleased
once
in
a
while
there
are
even
three
all
at
the
same
time
her
horror
turned
into
shrieks
of
laughter
why
your
women
are
like
our
dogs
human
beings
and
seals
never
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
the
old
man
in
the
corner
began
to
moan
and
mutter
feverishly
nicholas
went
to
him
bent
down
and
apparently
tried
to
soothe
him
muckluck
gathered
up
the
and
set
them
aside
you
were
at
the
holy
cross
school
asked
the
boy
six
years
with
mother
aloysius
and
the
sisters
they
very
good
so
you
a
catholic
then
oh
yes
you
speak
the
best
english
i
heard
from
a
native
i
love
sister
winifred
i
want
to
go
back
unless
she
regarded
the
boy
with
a
speculative
eye
unless
i
go
your
country
the
sick
man
began
to
talk
deliriously
and
lifted
up
a
terrible
old
face
with
eyes
glaring
through
wisps
of
straight
gray
hair
no
voice
but
his
was
heard
for
some
time
in
the
ighloo
then
i
fraid
said
muckluck
crouching
near
the
fire
but
with
head
turned
over
shoulder
staring
at
the
sick
man
no
wonder
said
the
boy
thinking
such
an
apparition
enough
to
frighten
anybody
nicholas
too
she
whispered
when
the
devil
talks
the
devil
yes
sh
you
hear
the
delirious
chatter
went
on
rising
to
a
scream
nicholas
came
hurrying
back
to
the
fire
with
a
look
of
terror
in
his
face
me
go
get
sham√°n
no
he
come
soon
muckluck
clung
to
him
they
both
crouched
down
by
the
fire
you
he
die
before
the
sham√°n
gets
here
oh
no
said
muckluck
soothingly
but
her
face
belied
her
words
the
sick
man
called
hoarsely
nicholas
got
him
some
water
and
propped
him
up
to
drink
he
glared
over
the
cup
with
wild
eyes
his
teeth
chattering
against
the
tin
the
boy
himself
felt
a
creep
go
down
his
spine
muckluck
moved
closer
to
him
must
say
he
die
she
whispered
if
nicholas
think
he
die
he
drag
him
out
leave
him
in
the
snow
never
sh
she
made
him
a
sign
to
be
quiet
the
rambling
went
on
nicholas
listening
fascinated
no
pymeut
she
whispered
like
live
in
ighloo
any
more
if
man
die
there
you
mean
if
they
know
a
person
dying
they
haul
him
out
doors
and
him
a
night
like
this
if
not
how
get
him
out
after
why
carry
him
out
him
touch
man
she
shuddered
oh
no
bad
bad
i
no
think
he
die
she
resumed
raising
her
voice
but
nicholas
rejoined
them
silent
looking
very
grave
was
he
contemplating
turning
the
poor
old
fellow
out
the
boy
sat
devising
schemes
to
prevent
the
barbarism
should
it
come
to
that
the
wind
had
risen
it
was
evidently
going
to
be
a
rough
night
with
imagination
full
of
sick
people
turned
out
to
perish
the
boy
started
up
as
a
long
wail
came
muffled
but
keen
still
with
anguish
down
through
the
snow
and
the
earth
by
way
of
the
into
the
dim
little
room
oh
nicholas
what
was
that
what
wait
listen
there
that
why
it
a
child
crying
no
him
ch√®e
let
go
and
bring
him
in
bring
dog
in
here
dog
that
no
dog
yes
him
dog
him
my
ch√®e
making
a
human
noise
like
that
nicholas
nodded
the
only
sounds
for
some
time
were
the
doleful
lamenting
of
the
mahlemeut
without
and
the
ravings
of
the
pymeut
chief
within
the
boy
was
conscious
of
a
queer
feeling
all
this
had
been
going
on
up
here
for
ages
it
had
been
like
this
when
columbus
came
over
the
sea
all
the
world
had
changed
since
then
except
the
steadfast
north
the
boy
sat
up
suddenly
and
rubbed
his
eyes
with
that
faculty
on
the
part
of
the
unlearned
that
one
is
tempted
to
call
american
a
faculty
for
assimilating
the
grave
conclusions
of
the
doctors
and
importing
them
into
personal
experience
he
realised
that
what
met
his
eyes
here
in
nicholas
house
was
one
of
the
oldest
pictures
humanity
has
presented
this
was
what
was
going
on
by
the
yukon
when
king
john
beside
that
other
river
was
yielding
magna
charta
to
the
barons
while
the
caesars
were
building
rome
the
pymeut
forefathers
were
building
just
such
ighloos
as
this
while
pheidias
wrought
his
marbles
the
men
up
here
carved
and
in
lieu
of
homer
recited
the
crow
last
flight
and
the
legend
of
the
northern
lights
nicholas
had
risen
again
his
mouth
set
hard
his
small
hands
shaking
he
unrolled
an
old
full
of
holes
and
examined
it
at
this
the
girl
who
had
been
about
to
make
up
the
fire
threw
down
the
bit
of
driftwood
and
hid
her
face
the
sick
man
babbled
on
faint
under
the
desolate
sound
another
sibilant
clearer
uncannily
human
nicholas
had
heard
too
for
he
threw
down
the
tattered
deerskin
and
went
to
the
other
side
of
the
fire
voices
in
the
tunnel
nicholas
held
back
the
flap
and
gravely
waited
there
till
one
pymeut
after
another
crawled
in
they
were
the
men
the
boy
had
seen
at
the
kachime
with
one
exception
a
old
fellow
thin
wiry
with
a
face
like
a
smoked
chimpanzee
and
eyes
of
unearthly
brightness
he
was
given
the
best
place
by
the
fire
and
held
his
brown
claws
over
the
red
coals
while
the
others
were
finding
their
places
the
boy
feeling
he
would
need
an
interpreter
signed
to
muckluck
to
come
and
sit
by
him
grave
as
a
judge
she
got
up
and
did
as
she
was
bid
that
the
sham√°n
whispered
the
boy
she
nodded
it
was
plain
that
this
apparition
however
hideous
had
given
her
great
satisfaction
any
more
people
coming
got
no
more
now
in
pymeut
where
is
everybody
some
sick
some
dead
the
old
chief
rambled
on
but
not
so
noisily
see
whispered
muckluck
devil
already
he
begin
to
speak
small
the
sham√°n
never
once
looked
towards
the
sufferer
till
he
himself
was
thoroughly
warm
even
then
he
withdrew
from
the
genial
glow
only
to
sit
back
humped
together
blinking
silent
the
boy
began
to
feel
that
if
he
did
finally
say
something
it
would
be
as
surprising
as
to
hear
an
aged
monkey
break
into
articulate
speech
nicholas
edged
towards
the
sham√°n
presenting
something
in
a
dish
what
that
a
deer
tongue
whispered
muckluck
the
boy
remembered
the
koyukun
song
thanks
for
a
good
meal
to
kuskokala
the
sham√°n
nicholas
seemed
to
be
haranguing
the
sham√°n
deferentially
but
with
spirit
he
pulled
out
from
the
bottom
of
his
father
bed
three
fine
shook
them
and
dangled
them
before
the
sham√°n
they
produced
no
effect
he
then
took
a
box
of
matches
and
a
plug
of
the
boy
tobacco
out
of
his
pocket
and
held
the
lot
towards
the
sham√°n
seeming
to
say
that
to
save
his
life
he
could
rake
up
another
earthly
thing
to
tempt
his
sham√°nship
although
the
sham√°n
took
the
offerings
his
little
black
eyes
glittered
none
the
less
rapaciously
as
they
flew
swiftly
round
the
room
falling
at
last
with
a
vicious
snap
and
gleam
upon
the
boy
then
it
was
that
for
the
first
time
he
spoke
nuh
nuh
interrupted
muckluck
chattering
volubly
and
evidently
commending
the
boy
to
the
sham√°n
several
of
the
old
bucks
laughed
he
say
yukon
inua
no
like
you
he
think
white
men
bring
plague
bring
devils
got
some
money
whispered
muckluck
not
here
the
boy
saw
the
moment
when
he
would
be
turned
out
he
plunged
his
hands
down
into
his
trousers
pockets
and
fished
up
a
knife
his
one
fortunately
tell
him
i
all
right
and
he
can
give
this
to
yukon
inua
with
my
respects
muckluck
explained
and
held
up
the
shining
object
blades
open
corkscrew
curling
attractively
before
the
covetous
eyes
of
the
sham√°n
when
he
could
endure
the
temptation
no
longer
his
two
black
claws
shot
out
but
nicholas
intercepted
the
object
while
as
it
seemed
he
drove
a
more
advantageous
bargain
terms
finally
settled
the
sham√°n
seized
the
knife
shut
it
secreted
it
with
a
final
grunt
and
stood
up
everyone
made
way
for
him
he
jerked
his
body
over
to
the
sick
man
lifted
the
lamp
with
his
shaky
old
hands
and
looked
at
the
patient
long
and
steadily
when
he
had
set
the
lamp
down
again
with
a
grunt
he
put
his
black
thumb
on
the
wick
and
squeezed
out
the
light
when
he
came
back
to
the
fire
which
had
burnt
low
he
pulled
open
his
parki
and
drew
out
an
ivory
wand
and
a
long
feather
with
a
fluffy
white
tuft
of
some
sort
at
the
end
he
deposited
these
solemnly
side
by
side
on
the
ground
about
two
feet
apart
turning
round
to
the
dying
fire
he
took
a
stick
and
with
help
gathered
the
ashes
up
and
laid
them
over
the
smouldering
brands
the
ighloo
was
practically
dark
no
one
dared
speak
save
the
yet
unabashed
devil
in
the
sick
man
who
muttered
angrily
it
was
curious
to
see
how
the
coughing
of
the
others
which
in
the
kachime
had
been
practically
constant
was
here
almost
silenced
whether
this
was
achieved
through
awe
and
respect
for
the
sham√°n
or
through
nervous
absorption
in
the
task
he
had
undertaken
who
shall
say
the
boy
felt
rather
than
saw
that
the
sham√°n
had
lain
down
between
the
ivory
wand
and
the
eagle
feather
each
man
sat
as
still
as
death
listening
staring
waiting
presently
a
little
jet
of
flame
sprang
up
out
of
the
ashes
the
sham√°n
lifted
his
head
angrily
saw
it
was
no
human
hand
that
had
dared
turn
on
the
light
growled
and
pulled
something
else
from
under
his
inexhaustible
parki
the
boy
peered
curiously
the
sham√°n
seemed
to
be
shutting
out
the
offensive
light
by
wrapping
himself
up
in
something
head
and
all
what
he
doing
now
the
boy
ventured
to
whisper
under
cover
of
the
devil
sudden
loud
remonstrance
the
sick
man
at
this
point
breaking
into
ghastly
groans
he
puts
on
the
kamlayka
sh
the
sham√°n
still
enveloped
head
and
body
began
to
beat
softly
keeping
time
with
the
eagle
feather
you
could
follow
the
faint
gleam
of
the
ivory
wand
but
on
what
it
fell
with
that
hollow
sound
no
eye
could
see
now
at
intervals
he
uttered
a
cry
a
deep
bass
singularly
unnerving
someone
answered
in
a
higher
key
and
they
kept
this
up
in
a
kind
of
rude
duet
till
one
by
one
the
whole
group
of
natives
was
gathered
into
the
swing
of
it
swept
along
involuntarily
it
would
seem
by
some
magnetic
attraction
of
the
rhythm
ung
hi
yah
was
the
chorus
to
that
deep
recurrent
cry
of
the
sham√°n
its
accompanying
was
muffled
like
thunder
conjured
out
of
the
earth
by
the
ivory
wand
presently
a
scream
of
terror
from
the
bundle
of
skins
and
bones
in
the
corner
ha
muckluck
clasped
her
hands
and
rocked
back
and
forth
they
frighten
the
old
man
to
death
if
he
conscious
said
the
boy
half
rising
she
pulled
him
down
no
no
frighten
devil
she
was
shaking
with
excitement
and
with
ecstacy
the
sick
man
cried
aloud
a
frenzy
seemed
to
seize
the
sham√°n
he
raised
his
voice
in
a
series
of
shrieks
then
dropped
it
moaning
whining
then
bursting
suddenly
into
diabolic
laughter
bellowing
whispering
ventriloquising
with
quite
extraordinary
skill
the
dim
and
foetid
cave
might
indeed
be
full
of
devils
if
the
hideous
outcry
slackened
but
an
instant
you
heard
the
sick
man
raving
with
the
preternatural
strength
of
delirium
or
of
mad
resentment
for
some
time
it
seemed
a
serious
question
as
to
who
would
come
out
ahead
just
as
you
began
to
feel
that
the
old
chief
was
at
the
end
of
his
tether
and
ready
to
give
up
the
ghost
the
sham√°n
rising
suddenly
with
a
demoniac
yell
flung
himself
down
on
the
floor
in
a
convulsion
his
body
writhed
horribly
he
kicked
and
snapped
and
quivered
the
boy
was
for
shielding
muckluck
from
the
crazy
flinging
out
of
legs
and
arms
but
she
leaned
over
breathless
to
catch
what
words
might
escape
the
sham√°n
during
the
fit
for
these
were
omens
of
deep
significance
when
at
last
the
convulsive
movements
quieted
and
the
sham√°n
lay
like
one
dead
except
for
an
occasional
faint
twitch
the
boy
realised
for
the
first
time
that
the
sick
man
too
was
dumb
dead
the
only
sound
now
was
the
wind
up
in
the
world
above
even
the
dog
was
still
the
silence
was
more
horrible
than
the
of
a
few
minutes
before
the
dim
group
sat
there
motionless
under
the
spell
of
the
stillness
even
more
than
they
had
been
under
the
spell
of
the
noise
at
last
a
queer
indescribable
scratching
and
scraping
came
up
out
of
the
bowels
of
the
earth
how
does
the
old
devil
manage
to
do
that
thought
the
boy
but
the
plain
truth
was
that
his
heart
was
in
his
mouth
for
the
sound
came
from
the
opposite
direction
behind
the
boy
and
not
near
the
sham√°n
at
all
it
grew
louder
came
nearer
more
inexplicable
more
awful
he
felt
he
could
not
bear
it
another
minute
sprang
up
and
stood
there
tense
waiting
for
what
might
befall
were
the
others
dead
then
not
a
sound
in
the
place
only
that
indescribable
stirring
of
something
in
the
solid
earth
under
his
feet
the
sham√°n
had
his
knife
a
ghastly
sensation
of
stifling
came
over
the
boy
as
he
thought
of
a
struggle
down
there
under
the
earth
and
the
snow
on
came
the
horrible
underground
thing
desperately
the
boy
stirred
the
almost
extinct
embers
with
his
foot
and
a
faint
glow
fell
on
the
faces
of
the
natives
fell
on
the
flap
moved
a
huge
hand
came
stealing
round
a
hand
the
skeleton
of
a
hand
white
ghastly
with
fingers
unimaginably
long
no
mortal
in
pymeut
had
a
hand
like
that
no
mortal
in
all
the
world
a
crisp
smart
sound
and
a
match
blazed
a
tall
lean
figure
rose
up
from
behind
the
and
received
the
sudden
brightness
full
in
his
face
pale
and
beautiful
but
angry
as
an
avenging
angel
for
an
instant
the
boy
still
thought
it
a
spectre
the
delusion
of
a
bewildered
brain
till
the
girl
cried
out
brother
paul
and
fell
forward
on
the
floor
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
light
make
a
light
he
commanded
nicholas
got
up
dazed
but
obedient
and
lit
the
lamp
the
voice
of
the
white
man
the
call
for
light
reached
the
sham√°n
he
seemed
to
shiver
and
shrink
under
the
folds
of
the
kamlayka
but
instead
of
getting
up
and
looking
his
enemy
in
the
face
he
wriggled
along
on
his
belly
still
under
cover
of
the
kamlayka
till
he
got
to
the
pushed
it
aside
with
a
motion
of
the
hooded
head
and
crawled
out
like
some
snaky
symbol
of
darkness
and
superstition
fleeing
before
the
light
brother
paul
sobbed
the
girl
do
tell
sister
winifred
he
took
no
notice
of
her
bending
down
over
the
motionless
bundle
in
the
corner
you
killed
him
i
suppose
brother
paul
began
nicholas
faltering
oh
i
heard
the
pandemonium
he
lifted
his
thin
white
face
to
the
it
all
useless
useless
i
might
as
well
go
and
leave
you
to
your
abominations
but
instead
go
all
of
you
go
he
flung
out
his
long
arms
and
the
group
broke
and
scuttled
huddling
near
the
fighting
like
rats
to
get
out
faster
than
the
narrow
passage
permitted
the
boy
turned
from
watching
the
instantaneous
flight
the
scuffle
and
the
disappearance
to
find
the
burning
eyes
of
the
jesuit
fixed
fascinated
on
his
face
if
brother
paul
had
appeared
as
a
spectre
in
the
ighloo
it
was
plain
that
he
looked
upon
the
white
face
present
at
the
diabolic
rite
as
dream
or
devil
the
boy
stood
up
the
started
and
crossed
himself
in
christ
name
what
who
are
you
i
a
i
come
from
the
white
camp
ten
miles
below
and
you
were
you
allowed
this
he
flung
up
his
arms
the
pale
lips
moved
convulsively
but
no
sound
came
forth
i
you
think
i
ought
to
have
interfered
began
the
boy
i
think
the
brother
began
bitterly
checked
himself
knelt
down
and
felt
the
old
man
pulse
nicholas
at
the
was
making
the
boy
signs
to
come
the
girl
was
sobbing
with
her
face
on
the
ground
again
nicholas
beckoned
and
then
disappeared
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
do
but
to
follow
his
host
when
the
had
dropped
behind
the
boy
and
he
crawled
after
nicholas
along
the
dark
passage
he
heard
the
muffled
voice
of
the
girl
praying
oh
mary
mother
of
god
do
let
him
tell
sister
winifred
chapter
vi
a

for

john
richard
green
the
boy
slept
that
night
in
the
kachime
beside
a
very
moody
restless
host
yagorsha
dispensed
with
the
formality
of
going
to
bed
and
seemed
bent
on
doing
what
he
could
to
keep
other
people
awake
he
sat
monologuing
under
the
seal
lamp
till
the
boy
longed
to
throw
the
dish
of
smouldering
oil
at
his
head
but
strangely
enough
when
through
sheer
fatigue
his
voice
failed
and
his
chin
fell
on
his
broad
chest
a
lad
of
fourteen
or
so
who
had
also
had
difficulty
to
keep
awake
would
jog
yagorsha
arm
repeating
interrogatively
the
last
phrase
used
whereon
the
old
would
rouse
himself
and
begin
afresh
with
an
iteration
of
the
previous
statement
if
the
lad
failed
to
keep
him
going
one
or
other
of
the
natives
would
stir
uneasily
lift
a
head
from
under
his
deerskin
and
remonstrate
yagorsha
opening
his
eyes
with
a
guilty
start
would
go
on
with
the
yarn
when
morning
came
and
the
others
waked
yagorsha
and
the
lad
slept
nicholas
and
all
the
rest
who
shared
the
bench
at
night
and
the
fire
in
the
morning
seemed
desperately
depressed
and
glum
a
heavy
cloud
hung
over
pymeut
for
pymeut
was
in
disgrace
about
sunset
the
women
came
in
with
the
kantaks
and
the
yagorsha
sat
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
he
listened
eagerly
while
the
others
questioned
the
women
the
old
chief
was
dead
at
all
no
he
was
much
better
brother
paul
had
been
about
to
all
the
sick
people
and
given
everybody
medicine
and
flour
and
a
terrible
scolding
oh
yes
he
was
angrier
than
anybody
had
ever
been
before
some
natives
from
the
school
at
holy
cross
were
coming
for
him
tomorrow
and
they
were
all
going
down
river
and
across
the
southern
portage
to
the
branch
mission
at
kuskoquim
down
river
sure
yes
sure
brother
paul
had
not
waited
to
come
with
those
others
being
so
anxious
to
bring
medicine
and
things
to
ol
chief
quick
and
this
was
how
he
was
welcomed
back
to
the
scene
of
his
labours
a
dance
was
going
on
that
was
what
he
called
it
you
savvy
said
nicholas
to
his
guest
brother
paul
go
plenty
soon
you
wait
i
have
company
back
to
camp
was
the
boy
first
thought
and
then
would
there
be
any
fun
in
that
after
all
it
was
plain
brother
paul
was
no
such
genial
companion
as
father
wills
and
so
it
was
that
he
did
not
desert
nicholas
although
brother
companions
failed
to
put
in
an
appearance
on
the
following
morning
however
on
the
third
day
after
the
incident
of
the
sham√°n
who
seemed
to
have
vanished
into
thin
air
brother
paul
shook
the
snow
of
pymeut
from
his
feet
and
with
three
indians
from
the
holy
cross
school
and
a
he
disappeared
from
the
scene
not
till
he
had
been
gone
some
time
did
nicholas
venture
to
return
to
the
parental
roof
they
found
muckluck
subdued
but
smiling
and
the
old
man
astonishingly
better
it
looked
almost
as
if
he
had
turned
the
corner
and
was
getting
well
there
was
certainly
something
very
like
magic
in
such
a
recovery
but
it
was
quickly
apparent
that
this
aspect
of
the
case
was
not
what
occupied
nicholas
as
he
sat
regarding
his
parent
with
a
keen
and
speculative
eye
he
asked
him
some
question
and
they
discussed
the
point
volubly
muckluck
following
the
argument
with
close
attention
presently
it
seemed
that
father
and
son
were
taking
the
guest
into
consideration
muckluck
also
turned
to
him
now
and
then
and
she
said
i
think
he
go
go
where
holy
cross
said
the
old
man
eagerly
brother
paul
nicholas
explained
he
go
river
we
get
holy
cross
more
quick
i
see
before
he
can
get
back
but
why
do
you
want
to
go
see
father
brachet
sister
winifred
say
tell
father
brachet
then
everything
all
right
contributed
muckluck
you
tell
pymeut
belly
solly
the
old
chief
said
nicholas
know
he
not
able
tell
all
like
white
man
muckluck
continued
nicholas
say

good
hey

pretty
tollable
thank
you
you

with
nicholas
you

father

sister
winifred
she
stopped
perplexed
vaguely
distrustful
at
the
boy
chuckling
you
think
we
can
explain
it
all
away
hey
he
made
a
gesture
of
happy
clearance
sham√°n
and
everything
hey
me
no
can
returned
nicholas
with
engaging
modesty
he
conveyed
a
limitless
confidence
well
i
be
jiggered
if
i
do
try
how
far
is
it
go
slow
one
sleep
well
we
wo
go
slow
we
got
to
do
penance
when
shall
we
start
too
late
now
tomalla
said
the
ol
chief
they
got
up
very
early
it
seemed
to
the
boy
like
the
middle
of
the
night
stole
out
of
the
dark
kachime
and
hurried
over
the
hard
crust
that
had
formed
on
the
last
fall
of
snow
down
the
bleak
dim
slope
to
the
ol
chief
where
they
were
to
breakfast
not
only
muckluck
was
up
and
doing
but
the
ol
chief
seemed
galvanised
into
unwonted
activity
he
was
doddering
about
between
his
bed
and
the
fire
laying
out
the
most
imposing
parkis
and
fur
blankets
and
a
pair
of
mittens
all
of
which
apparently
he
had
had
secreted
under
his
bed
or
between
it
and
the
wall
they
made
a
sumptuous
breakfast
of
tea
the
last
of
the
bacon
the
boy
had
brought
and
slapjacks
the
boy
kept
looking
from
time
to
time
at
the
display
of
furs
father
wills
was
right
he
ought
to
buy
a
parki
with
a
hood
but
he
had
meant
to
have
the
priest
advice
or
mac
at
least
before
investing
chief
watching
him
surreptitiously
and
seeing
he
was
no
nearer
making
an
offer
felt
he
should
have
some
encouragement
he
picked
up
the
mittens
and
held
them
out
present
said
ol
chief
you
tell
father
brachet
us
belly
solly
oh
i
handle
him
without
gloves
said
the
boy
giving
back
the
mittens
but
ol
chief
would
take
them
he
was
holding
up
the
smaller
of
the
two
parkis
you
no
like
oh
very
nice
you
no
buy
you
go
sleep
on
trail
said
nicholas
rising
briskly
you
die
no
parki
the
boy
laughed
and
shook
his
head
but
still
ol
chief
held
out
the
shirt
and
caressed
the
of
the
hood
him
cheap
how
cheap
dollah
do
know
as
i
call
that
cheap
yes
said
nicholas
michael
him
fifty
dollah
the
boy
looked
doubtful
i
saw
a
parki
there
at
the
store
about
like
this
for
twenty
parki
peeluck
nicholas
said
contemptuously
then
patting
the
one
his
father
held
out
you
wear
fifty
winter
lord
forbid
anyhow
i
only
got
about
twenty
dollars
worth
of
tobacco
and
stuff
along
with
me

come
white
camp
nicholas
volunteered
me
get
more
fi
dollah
oh
will
you
now
that
very
kind
of
you
but
nicholas
impervious
to
irony
held
out
the
parki
the
boy
laughed
and
took
it
nicholas
stooped
picked
up
the
fur
mittens
and
laying
them
on
the
boy
arm
reiterated
his
father
present
and
then
departed
to
the
kachime
to
bring
down
the
boy
pack
the
princess
meanwhile
had
withdrawn
to
her
own
special
corner
where
in
the
daytime
appeared
only
a
roll
of
plaited
mats
and
a
little
cheap
old
which
she
evidently
prized
most
of
all
she
had
in
the
world
you
see
lock
the
boy
expressed
surprise
and
admiration
no
really
i
call
that
fine
i
got
present
for
father
brachet
and
turning
over
the
rags
and
nondescript
rubbish
of
the
she
produced
an
object
whose
use
was
not
immediately
manifest
a
section
of
walrus
ivory
about
six
inches
long
had
been
cut
in
two
one
of
these
curved
halves
had
been
mounted
on
four
ivory
legs
in
the
upper
flat
side
had
been
stuck
at
equal
distances
from
the
two
ends
and
from
each
other
two
delicate
branches
of
notched
ivory
standing
up
like
horns
between
these
sat
an
ivory
mannikin
about
three
inches
long
with
a
woeful
countenance
and
with
arms
held
out
like
one
beseeching
mercy
it
fine
said
the
boy
but
a
what
it
for
just
look
pretty
wait
i
show
you
she
dived
into
the
and
fished
up
a
bit
of
battered
pencil
with
an
air
of
pride
she
placed
the
pencil
across
the
outstretched
hands
of
the
ivory
suppliant
asking
the
boy
in
was
not
this
a
that
might
be
trusted
to
melt
the
heart
of
the
holy
father
this
way
too
she
illustrated
how
anyone
embarrassed
by
the
possession
of
more
than
one
pencil
could
range
them
in
tiers
on
the
ivory
horns
above
the
head
of
the
woeful
one
i
call
that
scrumptious
and
he
looks
as
if
he
was
saying
he
was
sorry
all
the
time
she
nodded
delighted
that
the
boy
comprehended
the
subtle
symbolism
one
more
she
said
showing
her
dazzling
teeth
like
a
child
playing
a
game
she
half
shut
the
and
hugged
it
lovingly
then
with
eyes
sparkling
slowly
the
small
hand
crept
in
was
thrust
down
the
side
and
drew
out
with
a
rapturous
ha
a
gaudy
advertisement
card
setting
forth
the
advantages
of
smoking
kentucky
leaf
she
looked
at
it
fondly
then
slowly
regretfully
all
the
fun
gone
now
she
passed
it
to
the
boy
for
sister
winifred
she
said
like
one
who
braces
herself
to
make
some
huge
renunciation
you
tell
her
i
send
with
my
love
and
i
always
say
my
prayers
i
very
good
hey
you
tell
sister
winifred
said
the
boy
the
ol
chief
was
pulling
the
other
parki
over
his
head
nicholas
reappeared
with
the
visitor
effects
under
the
boy
eyes
he
calmly
confiscated
all
the
tea
and
tobacco
but
nothing
had
been
touched
in
the
owner
absence
look
here
just
leave
me
enough
tea
to
last
till
i
get
home
i
make
it
up
to
you
nicholas
after
some
reflection
agreed
then
he
bustled
about
gathered
together
an
armful
of
things
and
handed
the
boy
a
and
an
axe
you
bring
dogs
all
ready
mush
and
he
was
gone
to
the
boy
surprise
while
he
and
muckluck
were
getting
the
food
and
presents
together
the
lively
ol
chief
so
lately
dying
made
off
in
a
fine
new
parki
on
all
fours
curious
no
doubt
to
watch
the
preparations
without
but
not
a
bit
of
it
the
ol
chief
was
a
more
intimate
concern
in
the
expedition
when
the
boy
joined
him
there
he
was
sitting
up
in
nicholas
sled
appallingly
emaciated
but
brisk
as
you
please
ordering
the
disposition
of
the
axe
and
rifle
along
either
side
the
and
grub
between
his
feet
showing
how
the
blankets
should
be
wrapped
and
especially
was
he
dictatorial
about
the
lashing
of
the
mahout
how
far
he
comin
asked
the
boy
astonished
all
the
way
said
muckluck
he
want
to
be
several
bucks
came
running
down
from
the
kachime
and
stood
about
coughed
and
spat
and
offered
assistance
or
advice
when
at
last
chief
was
satisfied
with
the
way
the
raw
was
laced
and
lashed
nicholas
cracked
his
whip
and
shouted
mush
mush
princess
we
take
care
of
your
father
though
i
sure
he
ought
to
go
oh
yes
answered
muckluck
confidently
then
lower
sham√°n
make
all
well
quick
hey
do
forget
tell
sister
winifred
i
say
my
p
but
the
boy
had
to
run
to
keep
up
with
the
sled
for
some
time
he
kept
watching
the
ol
chief
with
unabated
astonishment
wondering
if
he
die
on
the
way
but
after
all
the
cure
was
tried
for
his
trouble
in
various
other
parts
of
the
world
why
not
here
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
nicholas
had
a
capital
team
of
dogs
and
knew
how
to
drive
them
folk
often
had
to
trot
pretty
briskly
to
keep
up
pymeut
was
soon
out
of
sight
nicholas
what
you
take
for
a
couple
o
your
dogs
no
sell
pay
you
a
good
long
price
no
sell
well
will
you
help
me
to
get
a
couple
me
try
but
he
spoke
dubiously
what
do
they
cost
good
leader
cost
hunder
and
fifty
in
st
michael
you
do
mean
dollahs
mean
dollahs
come
off
the
roof
but
nicholas
seemed
to
think
there
was
no
need
you
mean
that
if
i
offer
you
a
hundred
and
fifty
dollahs
for
your
leader
straight
off
this
minute
you
wo
take
it
no
no
take
said
the
prince
stolidly
and
his
friend
reflected
nicholas
without
a
would
be
practically
a
prisoner
for
eight
months
of
the
year
and
not
only
that
but
a
prisoner
in
danger
of
starving
to
death
after
all
perhaps
a
in
such
a
country
priceless
and
the
ol
chief
was
travelling
in
truly
royal
style
however
it
was
stinging
cold
and
running
after
those
expensive
dogs
was
an
occupation
that
palled
how
much
is
your
sled
worth
he
asked
ol
chief
six
sables
said
the
monarch
it
was
a
comfort
to
sight
a
settlement
off
there
on
the
point
what
this
place
pymeuts
there
no
all
gone
come
back
when
salmon
run
not
a
creature
there
as
nicholas
had
foretold
a
place
built
wilfully
on
the
most
exposed
point
possible
bleak
beyond
belief
if
you
open
your
mouth
at
this
place
on
the
yukon
you
have
to
swallow
a
hurricane
the
boy
choked
turned
his
back
to
spit
out
the
throttling
blast
and
when
he
could
catch
his
breath
inquired
this
a
good
place
for
a
village
bully
wind
come
blow
muskeetah
nicholas
signified
a
remote
destination
with
his
whip
you
this
kind
o
thing
would
discourage
even
a
mosquito
in
the
teeth
of
the
blast
they
went
past
the
pymeut
summer
resort
unlike
pymeut
proper
its
cabins
were
built
entirely
above
ground
of
logs
unchinked
its
roofs
of
watertight
a
couple
of
hours
farther
on
nicholas
permitted
a
halt
on
the
edge
of
a
struggling
little
grove
of
dwarfed
the
kettle
and
things
being
withdrawn
from
various
portions
of
the
chief
person
he
once
more
warmly
tucked
up
and
tightly
lashed
down
drew
the
edge
of
the
outer
coverlid
up
till
it
met
the
fringe
of
his
parki
hood
and
relapsed
into
slumber
nicholas
chopped
down
enough
green
wood
to
make
a
hearth
what
bang
on
the
snow
nicholas
nodded
laid
the
logs
side
by
side
and
on
them
built
a
fire
of
the
seasoned
wood
the
boy
had
gathered
they
boiled
the
kettle
made
tea
and
cooked
some
fish
ol
chief
waked
up
just
in
time
to
get
his
share
the
boy
who
had
kept
hanging
about
the
dogs
with
unabated
interest
had
got
up
from
the
fire
to
carry
them
the
scraps
when
nicholas
called
out
quite
angrily
no
no
feed
dogs
and
waved
the
boy
off
what
it
only
some
of
my
fish
fish
is
what
they
eat
ai
it
no
feed
now
wait
till
night
what
for
they
hungry
you
give
fish
dogs
no
go
any
more
peremptorily
he
waved
the
boy
off
and
fell
to
work
at
packing
up
not
understanding
nicholas
wisdom
the
boy
was
feeling
a
little
sulky
and
did
help
he
finished
up
the
fish
himself
then
sat
on
his
heels
by
the
fire
scorching
his
face
while
his
back
froze
or
wheeling
round
and
singeing
his
new
parki
while
his
hands
grew
stiff
in
spite
of
mittens
no
it
was
no
fun
camping
with
the
temperature
at
thirty
degrees
below
zero
better
to
be
trotting
after
those
expensive
and
dinnerless
dogs
and
he
was
glad
when
they
started
again
but
once
beyond
the
scant
shelter
of
the
cottonwood
it
was
evident
the
wind
had
risen
it
was
blowing
straight
out
of
the
north
and
into
their
faces
there
were
times
when
you
could
lean
your
whole
weight
against
the
blast
after
sunset
the
air
began
to
fill
with
particles
of
frozen
snow
they
did
not
seem
to
fall
but
continually
to
whirl
about
and
present
stinging
points
to
the
travellers
faces
talking
was
possible
even
if
you
were
in
the
humour
and
the
dead
blank
silence
of
all
nature
unbroken
hour
after
hour
became
as
as
the
cold
and
stinging
wind
the
boy
fell
behind
a
little
those
places
on
his
heels
that
had
been
so
badly
galled
had
begun
to
be
troublesome
again
well
it
would
do
any
good
to
holla
about
it
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
harden
one
foolish
feet
but
in
his
heart
he
felt
that
all
the
conditions
of
a
penitential
journey
were
being
complied
with
except
on
the
part
of
the
arch
sinner
ol
chief
seemed
to
be
getting
on
the
dogs
hardly
yet
broken
in
to
the
winter
work
were
growing
discouraged
travelling
so
long
in
the
eye
of
the
wind
and
nicholas
in
the
kind
of
stolid
depression
that
had
taken
possession
of
him
seemed
to
have
forgotten
even
to
shout
mush
for
a
very
long
time
ol
chief
called
out
sharply
and
nicholas
seemed
to
wake
up
he
stopped
looked
back
and
beckoned
to
his
companion
the
boy
came
slowly
on
why
you
no
push
push
what
he
went
to
the
sled
and
illustrated
laying
his
hands
on
the
arrangement
at
the
back
that
stood
out
like
the
handle
behind
a
perambulator
the
boy
remembered
of
course
there
were
usually
two
men
with
each
sled
one
ran
ahead
and
broke
trail
with
but
that
was
necessary
today
for
the
crust
bore
but
the
other
business
was
to
guide
the
sled
from
behind
and
keep
it
on
the
trail
me
gottah
drive
you
gottah
push
dogs
heap
tired
nicholas
spoke
severely
the
boy
stared
a
moment
at
what
he
mentally
called
the
nerve
of
the
fella
laughed
and
took
hold
swallowing
nicholas
intimation
that
he
after
all
was
far
more
considerate
of
the
dogs
than
the
person
merely
sentimental
who
had
been
willing
to
share
his
dinner
with
them
how
much
farther
oh
pretty
quick
now
the
driver
cracked
his
whip
called
out
to
the
dogs
and
suddenly
turned
off
from
the
river
course
unerringly
he
followed
an
invisible
trail
turning
sharply
up
a
slough
and
went
on
without
apparent
plan
it
was
better
going
when
they
got
to
a
frozen
lake
and
the
dogs
seemed
not
to
need
so
much
encouragement
it
would
appear
an
impossible
task
to
steer
accurately
with
so
little
light
but
once
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
it
was
found
that
nicholas
had
hit
a
track
as
neatly
as
a
thread
finds
the
needle
eye
far
off
out
of
the
dimness
came
a
sound
welcome
because
it
was
something
to
break
the
silence
but
hardly
cheerful
in
itself
hear
that
nicholas
mission
dogs
their
own
had
already
thrown
up
their
noses
and
bettered
the
pace
the
barking
of
the
dogs
had
not
only
announced
the
mission
to
the
travellers
but
to
the
mission
a
stranger
at
the
gates
before
anything
could
be
seen
of
the
settlement
clumsy
figures
had
come
running
down
the
slope
and
across
the
ice
greeting
nicholas
with
hilarity
indian
or
esquimaux
boys
they
seemed
to
be
who
talked
some
jargon
understanded
of
the
pymeut
pilot
the
boy
lifting
tired
eyes
saw
something
white
glimmering
high
in
the
air
up
on
the
right
river
bank
in
this
light
it
refused
to
form
part
of
any
conceivable
plan
but
hung
there
in
the
air
detached
enigmatic
spectral
below
it
more
on
humanity
level
could
be
dimly
distinguished
now
the
mission
buildings
apparently
in
two
groups
with
an
open
space
in
the
middle
where
are
the
white
people
wondered
the
boy
childishly
impatient
wo
they
come
and
welcome
us
he
followed
the
esquimaux
and
indians
from
the
river
up
to
the
left
group
of
buildings
with
the
heathen
jargon
beating
on
his
ears
he
looked
up
suddenly
and
realized
what
the
white
thing
was
that
had
shone
out
so
far
in
the
middle
of
the
open
space
a
wooden
cross
stood
up
encrusted
with
frost
crystals
and
lifting
gleaming
arms
out
of
the
gloom
twenty
feet
or
so
above
the
heads
of
the
people
funny
thing
for
an
agnostic
he
admitted
to
himself
but
i
right
glad
to
see
a
christian
sign
and
as
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
big
on
the
left
he
defended
himself
it
the
of
the
pendulum
after
a
big
dose
of
pymeut
and
heathen
tricks
i
welcome
it
as
a
mark
of
the
white
man
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
a
little
defiantly
at
the
holy
cross
recognition
of
what
the
high
white
apparition
was
had
given
him
a
queer
jolt
stirring
unsuspected
things
in
imagination
and
in
memory
he
had
been
accustomed
to
see
that
symbol
all
his
life
and
it
had
never
spoken
to
him
before
up
here
it
cried
aloud
and
dominated
the
scene
humph
he
said
to
himself
to
look
at
you
a
body
think
origin
had
never
been
written
and
spencer
and
huxley
had
never
been
born
he
knocked
again
and
again
turned
about
to
scan
the
cross
just
as
much
a
superstition
just
as
much
a
fetich
as
or
the
sham√°n
eagle
feather
with
long
looking
at
a
couple
of
crossed
sticks
men
grow
as
dazed
as
hypnotized
as
pymeuts
watching
a
sham√°n
ivory
wand
all
the
same
i
not
sure
that
faith
in
principles
would
build
a
house
like
this
in
the
arctic
regions
and
it
convenient
to
find
it
here
if
only
they
open
the
door
he
gave
another
thundering
knock
and
then
nearly
fell
backwards
into
the
snow
for
brother
paul
stood
on
the
threshold
holding
up
a
lamp
i
a
oh
how
do
you
do
can
i
come
in
brother
paul
still
with
the
look
of
the
avenging
angel
on
his
pale
young
face
held
the
door
open
to
let
the
boy
come
in
then
leaning
out
into
the
night
and
lifting
the
lamp
high
is
that
nicholas
he
said
sternly
but
the
pymeuts
and
the
had
vanished
he
came
in
and
set
down
the
lamp
we
a
we
heard
you
were
going
down
river
said
the
boy
tamely
for
he
had
not
yet
recovered
himself
after
such
an
unexpected
blow
are
you
cold
are
you
wet
demanded
brother
paul
standing
erect
unwelcoming
by
the
table
that
held
the
lamp
the
boy
pulled
himself
together
look
here
he
turned
away
from
the
comforting
stove
and
confronted
the
jesuit
those
pymeuts
are
not
only
cold
and
wet
and
sick
too
but
they
sorry
they
come
to
ask
forgiveness
it
easily
done
such
scorn
you
would
hardly
expect
from
a
follower
of
the
meek
galilean
no
not
easily
done
a
penance
like
this
i
know
for
i
just
travelled
that
thirty
miles
with
over
the
ice
from
pymeut
you
yes
it
amuses
you
the
sombre
eyes
shone
with
a
cold
disconcerting
light
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
been
better
amused
the
boy
looked
down
at
his
weary
wounded
feet
and
the
others
where
were
his
fellow
pilgrims
it
struck
him
as
comic
that
the
upshot
of
the
journey
should
be
that
he
was
doing
penance
for
the
pymeuts
but
he
could
smile
with
that
offended
archangel
in
front
of
him
thirty
miles
over
the
ice
in
the
face
of
a
norther
has
been
so
even
for
me
and
i
not
old
nor
sick
no
nor
frightened
brother
paul
he
flung
up
his
head
but
his
heart
failed
him
even
while
he
made
the
boast
silently
for
a
moment
they
confronted
each
other
where
are
you
bound
for
i
a
the
boy
had
a
moment
of
wondering
if
he
was
expected
to
answer
hell
and
he
hesitated
are
you
on
your
way
up
the
river
no
i
was
the
man
not
going
to
let
them
rest
their
wicked
bones
there
a
single
night
a
i
the
frozen
river
and
the
wood
were
as
hospitable
as
the
beautiful
face
of
the
brother
involuntarily
the
boy
shivered
i
came
to
see
the
father
superior
he
dropped
back
into
a
chair
the
father
superior
is
busy
i
wait
and
very
tired
so
i
worn
out
with
the
long
raging
of
the
plague
i
have
waited
till
he
is
less
harassed
to
tell
him
about
the
pymeuts
deliberate
depravity
nicholas
too
one
of
our
own
people
one
of
the
first
pupils
of
the
school
a
communicant
in
the
church
distinguished
by
a
thousand
kindnesses
and
this
the
return
the
return
is
that
he
takes
his
backsliding
so
to
heart
he
ca
rest
without
coming
to
confess
and
to
beg
the
father
superior
i
shall
tell
the
father
superior
what
i
heard
and
saw
he
will
agree
that
for
the
sake
of
others
who
are
trying
to
resist
temptation
an
example
should
be
made
of
nicholas
and
of
his
father
and
yet
you
nursed
the
old
man
and
were
kind
to
him
i
believe
after
the
offense
i
i
thought
you
had
killed
him
but
even
you
must
see
that
we
can
not
have
a
man
received
here
as
nicholas
was
the
most
favoured
child
of
the
mission
who
helps
to
perpetuate
the
degrading
blasphemies
of
his
unhappy
race
it
nothing
to
you
you
even
encourage
my
soul
but
brother
paul
struck
in
with
an
impassioned
earnestness
we
spend
a
making
christians
of
these
people
and
such
as
you
come
here
and
in
a
week
undo
the
work
of
years
i
it
only
eighteen
months
since
i
myself
came
but
already
seen
the
torrent
poured
out
with
never
a
pause
last
summer
some
white
prospectors
bribed
our
best
native
teacher
to
leave
us
and
become
a
guide
he
a
drunken
wreck
now
somewhere
up
on
the
yukon
flats
you
take
our
boys
for
pilots
you
entice
our
girls
away
with
trinkets
great
caesar
do
but
vain
was
protest
for
brother
paul
the
visitor
was
not
a
particular
individual
he
stood
there
for
the
type
of
the
vicious
white
adventurer
the
sunken
eyes
of
the
burning
impersonal
saw
not
a
particular
young
man
and
a
case
compounded
of
mixed
elements
but
the
enemy
against
whom
night
and
day
he
waged
incessant
warfare
the
fathers
and
sisters
wear
out
their
lives
to
save
these
people
we
teach
them
with
incredible
pains
the
fundamental
rules
of
civilization
we
teach
them
how
to
save
their
souls
alive
the
boy
had
jumped
up
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
come
you
teach
them
to
smoke
the
boy
wheeled
round
i
do
smoke
and
to
gamble
nicholas
taught
to
gamble
brother
paul
i
swear
yes
and
to
swear
and
get
drunk
and
so
find
the
shortest
way
to
hell
father
brachet
father
wills
a
voice
called
without
the
turned
under
the
boy
hand
and
before
he
could
more
than
draw
back
a
whiff
of
winter
blew
into
the
room
and
a
creature
stood
there
such
as
no
man
looks
to
find
on
his
way
to
an
arctic
gold
camp
a
girl
of
twenty
odd
with
the
face
of
a
saint
dressed
in
the
black
habit
of
the
order
of
anne
oh
brother
paul
you
are
wanted
wanted
quickly
i
think
catherine
is
worse
do
wait
or
she
die
without
and
as
suddenly
as
she
came
the
vision
vanished
carrying
brother
paul
in
the
wake
of
her
streaming
veil
the
boy
sat
down
by
the
stove
cogitating
how
he
should
best
set
about
finding
nicholas
to
explain
the
failure
of
their
mission
what
was
that
voices
from
the
other
side
the
opposite
door
opened
and
a
man
appeared
with
nicholas
and
his
father
close
behind
looking
anything
but
cast
down
or
decently
penitential
how
do
you
do
the
white
man
english
had
a
strong
french
accent
he
shook
hands
with
great
cordiality
we
have
heard
of
you
from
father
wills
also
these
pymeut
friends
of
ours
say
you
have
something
to
tell
me
he
spoke
as
though
this
something
were
expected
to
be
highly
gratifying
and
indeed
the
cheerfulness
of
nicholas
and
his
father
would
indicate
as
much
as
the
boy
hesitating
did
not
accept
the
chair
offered
smiling
the
jesuit
went
on
will
you
talk
of
zis
matter
whatever
it
is
first
or
will
you
first
go
up
and
wash
and
have
our
conference
after
supper
no
thank
you
a
are
you
the
father
superior
he
bowed
a
little
ceremoniously
but
still
smiling
i
am
father
brachet
oh
well
nicholas
is
right
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
explain
why
we
here
was
it
the
heat
of
the
stove
after
the
long
hours
of
cold
that
made
him
feel
a
little
dizzy
he
put
up
his
hand
to
his
head
i
have
told
zem
to
take
hot
water
upstairs
the
father
was
saying
and
i
zink
a
glass
of
toddy
would
be
a
good
sing
for
you
he
slightly
emphasised
the
you
and
turned
as
if
to
supplement
the
original
order
no
no
the
boy
called
after
him
choking
a
little
half
with
suppressed
merriment
half
with
nervous
fatigue
father
brachet
if
you
kind
to
us
brother
paul
will
never
forgive
you
we
all
in
disgrace
hein
what
yes
we
all
desperately
wicked
no
no
objected
nicholas
ready
to
go
back
on
so
tactless
an
advocate
and
brother
paul
has
just
been
saying
what
is
it
what
is
it
the
father
superior
spoke
a
little
sharply
and
himself
sat
down
in
the
wooden
armchair
he
before
had
placed
for
his
white
guest
the
three
culprits
stood
in
front
of
him
on
a
dead
level
of
iniquity
you
see
father
brachet
ol
chief
has
been
very
ill
i
know
much
as
we
needed
him
here
paul
insisted
on
hurrying
back
to
pymeut
he
interrupted
himself
as
readily
as
he
had
interrupted
the
boy
but
ze
ol
chief
looks
lively
enough
yes
he
a
his
spirits
have
been
raised
by
a
what
you
will
think
an
unwarrantable
and
wicked
means
nicholas
understood
at
least
that
objectionable
word
wicked
cropping
up
again
and
he
was
not
prepared
to
stand
it
from
the
boy
he
grunted
with
displeasure
and
said
something
low
to
his
father
brother
paul
found
them
found
having
a
s√©ance
with
the
sham√°n
father
brachet
turned
sharply
to
the
natives
ha
you
go
back
to
zat
nicholas
came
a
step
forward
twisting
his
mittens
and
rolling
his
eye
excitedly
us
no
wicked
sham√°n
say
he
gottah
scare
off
he
waved
his
arm
against
an
invisible
army
then
as
it
were
stung
into
plain
speaking
sham√°n
say
bring
sickness
bring
devils
maybe
the
old
orang
outang
right
the
boy
drew
a
tired
breath
and
sat
down
without
bidding
in
one
of
the
wooden
chairs
what
an
idiot
he
been
not
to
take
the
hot
grog
and
the
hot
bath
and
leave
these
people
to
fight
their
foolishness
out
among
themselves
it
did
concern
him
and
here
was
nicholas
talking
away
comfortably
in
his
own
tongue
and
the
father
was
answering
a
native
opened
the
door
and
peeped
in
cautiously
nicholas
paused
hein
said
father
brachet
what
is
it
the
indian
came
in
with
two
cups
of
hot
tea
and
a
cracker
in
each
saucer
he
stopped
at
the
priest
side
you
get
sick
too
please

supper
little
late
he
nodded
to
nicholas
and
gave
the
white
stranger
the
second
cup
as
he
was
going
out
same
man
here
in
july
you
know
he
tapped
himself
on
the
left
side
man
with
sore
heart
yansey

the
priest
quickly
well

sore

brother
paul

he
padded
out
of
the
room
in
his
soft
native
shoes
then
brother
paul

polished

catherine
thought
the
boy
and
he
wo
waste
much
time
over
a
sore
heart
it
behoves
us
to
hurry
up
with
our
penitence
this
seemed
to
be
nicholas
view
as

he
was
beginning
again
in
his
own
tongue
you
know
we
like
best
for
you

said
the
priest
gently

long
on
ze
john

your
perfidious
tongue

pymeuts

he
turned
away
from
the
priest
and
challenged
the
boy
to
repeat
the
slander
then
with
an
insinuating
air
sham√°n
no

he
reassured
the
father
sham√°n

cheechalko

cheechalko
all

he
wound
up
flinging
subterfuge
to
the
winds
and
openly
indicating
his
faithless
ambassador
strikes
me
i
gettin
the
worst
of
this
argument
all
round
brother

sailing
into
me
on
pretty
much
the
same
tack
no
said
nicholas
firmly
brother
paul
no
unnerstan
unnerstan
he
came
still
nearer
to
the
father
speaking
in
a
friendly
confidential
tone

he
let
his
mittens
fall
on
the
floor
crouched
on
his
heels
and
rocked
his
head
in
his
hands
springing
up
he
went
on
with
slow
sorrowful
emphasis
men

zen

said
the
father
wiz
nurses
and
proper
medicine
nicholas
gave
the
ghost
of
a
shrug
adding
the
damaging
fact
sickness

to
holy
cross
the
father
nodded
we
had
to
turn
ze
schools
into

for

patients

explained
to
the
stranger

paul
i
fear

sickening
too
yes
it
true
ze
disease
came
to
us
from
pymeut
in
the
father
mind
was
the
thought
of
contagion
courageously
faced
in
order
to
succour
the
least
of
these
my
brethren
in
nicholas
mind
was
the
perplexing
fact
that
these
white
men
could
bring
sickness
but
not
stay
it
even
the
heap
good
people
at
holy
cross
were
not
saved
by
their
deaf
and
impotent
god
fathers

french

of
the
shoulders
sham√°n

to

nicholas
the

wearily
i

better
zat
old
sham√°n
he
is
a
rare
old
rogue
what
did
you
give
him
nicholas
mental
processes
may
not
have
been
flattering
but
their
clearness
was
unmistakable
if
father
brachet
was
jealous
of
the
rival
holy
man
revenue
it
was
time
to
bring
out
the
presents
ol
chief
had
a
fine
over
his
arm
he
advanced
at
a
word
from
nicholas
and
laid
it
down
before
the
father
no
said
father
brachet
with
startling
suddenness
take
it
away
and
try
to
understand
nicholas
approached
trembling
but
no
doubt
remembering
how
necessary
it
had
been
to
add
to
the
sham√°n
offering
before
he
would
consent
to
listen
with
favour
to
pymeut
prayers
he
pulled
out
of
their
respective
hiding
places
about
his
person
a
carved
ivory
spoon
and
an
embroidered
pouch
advanced
boldly
under
the
fire
of
the
superior
keen
eyes
and
sharp
words
and
laid
the
further
offering
on
the
at
his
feet
take

said
the
priest
interrupting
his
brief
homily
and
standing
up
do
you

friends
wizzout

and
wizzout

away
no
one

zem
at
holy
cross
ol
chief
wiped
his
eyes
pathetically
nicholas
the
picture
of
despair
turned
in
a
speechless
appeal
to
his
despised
ambassador
before
anyone
could
speak
the
rattled
rudely
and
the
big
of
a
white
man
was
put
in
pardon
mon
p√®re
cet
homme
qui
vient
de
min√≥ok
faudrait
le
coucher
de
suite
mais
o√π
mon
dieu
o√π
while
the
superior
cogitated
brother
etienne
said
nicholas
and
they
nodded
brother
etienne
brought
the
rest
of
his
heavy
body
half
inside
the
door
he
wore
aged
breeches
and
a
black
sweater
over
an
old
hickory
shirt
ses

laiss√©
l√†
je
crois
mais
√ßa
ne
durera
pas
longtemps

bien
reste
ici
je
ne
vois
pas
moyen
said
the
father
enfin
on
verra
attendez
quelques
instants
bien
brother
etienne
went
out
ol
chief
was
pulling
the
boy
sleeve
during
the
little
colloquy
and
saying
you
tell
but
the
boy
got
up
like
one
who
means
to
make
an
end
you
have
any
time
or
strength
for
this
oh
yes
said
father
brachet
smiling
and
arresting
the
impetuous
movement
ziz
is
part
of
it
well
said
the
boy
still
hesitating
they
sorry
you
know
sorry
you
sink
so
the
question
rang
a
little
sceptically
yes
i
do
and
i
in
a
position
to
know
you
forgive
them
if
seen
as
i
did
how
miserable
and
overwhelmed
they
were
when
brother
paul
when
i
not
saying
it
the
highest
kind
of
religion
that
they
so
almighty
afraid
of
losing
your
good
opinion
but
it
it
gives
you
a
hold
does
it
and
then
as
the
superior
said
nothing
only
kept
intent
eyes
on
the
young
face
the
boy
wound
up
a
little
angrily
unless
of
course
you
like
brother
paul
ready
to
throw
away
the
power
you
gained
paul
serves
a
great
and
noble
purpose
but
zese
questions
are
a
not
in
his
province
still
he
bored
into
the
young
face
with
those
kind
gimlets
his
good
little
eyes
and
you
are
one
of
us
he
asked
of
ze
church
no
i
i
afraid
i
not
of
any
church
ah
and
i
ought
to
take
back
but
i
telling
you
the
truth
when
i
say
there
never
were
honester
penitents
than
the
pymeuts
the
whole
kachime
miserable
even
the
girl
ol
chief
daughter
she
cried
like
anything
when
she
thought
sister
winifred
sister
winifred
would
be
disappointed
in
her
ah
yes
sister
winifred
has
zem
he
held
out
his
hand
spread
the
fingers
apart
and
slowly
gently
closed
them
comme
√ßa
but
what
the
good
of
it
if
brother
paul
ah
it
is
not
just
zere
paul
comes
in
but
i
tell
you
my
son
paul
does
a
work
here
no
ozzer
man
has
done
so
well
he
is
a
flint
a
fanatic
fanatique
he
flung
out
an
expressive
hand
it
is
a
name
my
son
it
often
means
no
more
but
zat
a
man
is
in
earnest
out
of
such
a
we
strike
sparks
and
many
a
generous
fire
is
set
alight
we
all
do
what
we
can
here
at
holy
cross
but
paul
will
do
what
we
can
not
well
give
he
was
on
the
point
of
saying
father
wills
but
changed
it
to
a
man
who
is
tolerant
tolerant
zere
are
plenty
to
be
tolerant
my
son
ze
world
is
full
but
when
you
find
a
man
zat
can
zat
can
be
ah
it
is
he
came
a
little
nearer
it
is
but
as
if
i
would
look
at
you
and
say
has
earnest
eyes
he
will
go
far
road
he
follow
he
drew
off
smiling
shrewdly
you
may
live
my
son
to
be
yourself
called
zen
you
will
know
how
little
i
the
boy
broke
in
you
are
pretty
wide
of
the
mark
this
time
ah
perhaps
but
zere
are
more
trails
zan
ze
yukon
for
a
fanatique
you
have
zere
somesing
to
show
me
i
promised
the
girl
that
cried
so
i
promised
her
to
bring
the
sister
this
he
had
pulled
out
the
picture
in
spite
of
the
careful
wrapping
it
had
got
rather
crumpled
the
father
looked
at
it
and
then
a
swift
glance
passed
between
him
and
the
boy
you
could
see
it
was
like
pulling
out
teeth
to
part
with
it
can
it
go
up
there
till
the
sister
sends
for
it
father
brachet
nodded
and
the
gorgeous
worldling
counselling
all
men
to
smoke
kentucky
leaf
was
set
up
in
the
high
place
of
honour
on
the
beside
a
print
of
the
madonna
and
the
holy
child
nicholas
cheered
up
at
this
and
ol
chief
stopped
wiping
his
eyes
while
the
boy
stood
at
the
mantel
with
his
back
to
father
brachet
acting
on
a
sudden
impulse
he
pulled
the
ivory
out
of
his
shirt
and
stuck
its
various
parts
together
saying
as
he
did
so
she
sent
an
offering
to
you
too
if
the
ol
chief
an
i
fail
to
convince
you
of
our
penitence
we
all
willin
to
let
this
gentleman
plead
for
us
whereupon
he
wheeled
round
and
held
up
the
woeful
one
before
the
father
eyes
the
priest
grasped
the
offering
with
an
almost
convulsive
joy
and
instantly
turned
his
back
that
the
pymeuts
might
not
see
the
laugh
that
twisted
up
his
humorous
old
features
the
penitents
looked
at
each
other
and
telegraphed
in
pymeut
that
after
all
the
boy
had
come
up
to
time
the
father
had
refused
the
valuable
and
superior
spoon
but
was
ready
it
appeared
to
look
with
favour
on
anything
the
boy
offered
but
very
seriously
the
priest
turned
round
upon
the
pymeuts
i
will
just
say
a
word
to
you
before
we
wash
and
go
in
to
supper
with
a
kindly
gravity
he
pronounced
a
few
simple
sentences
about
the
gentleness
of
christ
with
the
ignorant
but
how
offended
the
heavenly
father
was
when
those
who
knew
the
true
god
descended
to
idolatrous
practices
and
how
entirely
he
could
be
depended
upon
to
punish
wicked
people
ol
chief
nodded
vigorously
and
with
sudden
excitement
me
jus
like
god
hein
oh
yes
me
no
stan
wicked
people
when
me
young
me
kill
two
squaws
with
an
outward
gesture
of
his
lean
claws
he
swept
these
wicked
ones
off
the
face
of
the
earth
like
a
besom
of
the
lord
a
sudden
change
had
passed
over
the
tired
face
of
the
priest
go
go
he
called
out
driving
the
pymeuts
forth
as
one
shoos
chickens
out
of
a
garden
go
to
ze
schoolhouse
and
get
fed
for
it
all
you
seem
able
to
get
zere
but
the
perplexed
flight
of
the
pymeuts
was
arrested
brother
paul
and
brother
etienne
blocked
the
way
with
a
stretcher
they
all
stood
back
to
let
the
little
procession
come
in
nobody
noticed
them
further
but
the
pymeuts
scuttled
away
the
instant
they
could
get
by
the
boy
equally
forgotten
sat
down
in
a
corner
while
the
three
priests
conferred
in
french
over
the
prostrate
figure
father
brachet
a
weak
voice
came
up
from
the
floor
brother
paul
hurried
out
calling
brother
etienne
softly
from
the
door
i
am
here
the
superior
came
from
the
foot
of
the
pallet
and
knelt
down
near
the
head
you
remember
what
you
said
last
july
about
about
making
restitution
yes
well
i
can
do
it
now
i
am
glad
i
brought
you
the
papers
that
why
i
to
come
will
you
take
them
out
of
my
the
priest
unbuckled
a
buckskin
miner
belt
and
laid
it
on
the
floor
all
the
many
pockets
were
empty
save
the
long
one
in
the
middle
he
unbuttoned
the
flap
and
took
out
some
soiled
papers
are
zese
in
proper
form
he
asked
but
the
man
seemed
to
have
dropped
into
unconsciousness
hurriedly
the
priest
added
zere
is
no
time
to
read
zem
ah
will
you
come
and
witness
zis
last
will
and
testament
the
boy
got
up
and
stood
near
the
man
from
min√≥ok
opened
his
eyes
here
the
priest
had
got
writing
materials
and
put
a
pen
into
the
slack
hand
with
a
block
of
under
it
i
i
no
lawyer
said
the
faint
voice
but
i
think
it
all
in
shape
anyhow
you
write
and
i
sign
he
half
closed
his
eyes
and
the
paper
slipped
from
under
his
hand
the
boy
caught
it
and
set
down
the
faint
words
will
and
bequeath
to
john
berg
kansas
city
my
right
and
title
to
claim
no
above
little
min√≥ok
yukon
ramparts
and
the
voice
fell
away
into
silence
they
waited
a
moment
and
the
superior
whispered
can
you
sign
it
the
dull
eyes
opened
did
i
father
brachet
held
him
up
the
boy
gave
him
the
pen
and
steadied
the
paper
thank
you
father
obliged
to
you
too
he
turned
his
dimming
eyes
upon
the
boy
who
wrote
his
name
in
witness
you
going
to
min√≥ok
i
hope
so
the
father
went
to
the
where
he
tied
up
and
sealed
the
packet
anybody
that
going
to
min√≥ok
will
have
to
hustle
the
slang
of
everyday
energy
sounded
strangely
from
dying
lips
almost
a
whisper
and
yet
like
a
bugle
calling
a
captive
to
battle
the
boy
leaned
down
to
catch
the
words
yet
fainter
good
claims
going
like
hot
cakes
how
much
the
boy
asked
breathless
did
you
get
out
of
yours
waiting
till
summer
nex
summer
the
eyelids
fell
so
it
is
a
fake
after
all
the
boy
stood
up
the
camp
all
right
you
see
it
will
the
klondyke
ha
how
long
have
you
been
making
the
trip
since
august
the
wild
flame
of
enterprise
sunk
in
the
heart
of
the
hearer
since
no
cash
for
steamers
we
had
a
canoe
she
went
to
pieces
up
by
the
weak
voice
fell
down
into
that
deep
gulf
that
yawns
waiting
for
last
word
but
there
is
gold
at
min√≥ok
you
sure
you
seen
it
the
father
superior
locked
away
the
packet
and
stood
up
but
the
boy
was
bending
down
fascinated
listening
at
the
white
lips
there
is
gold
there
he
repeated
out
of
the
gulf
came
faintly
back
like
an
echo
plenty
o
gold
there
plenty
o
gold
he
stood
up
and
found
himself
opposite
the
contemplative
face
of
the
priest
we
have
neglected
you
my
son
come
upstairs
to
my
room
they
went
out
the
old
head
bent
and
full
of
thought
the
young
head
high
and
full
of
dreams
oh
to
reach
this
min√≥ok
where
there
was
plenty
of
gold
plenty
of
gold
before
the
spring
floods
brought
thousands
what
did
any
risk
matter
think
of
the
pymeuts
doing
their
sixty
miles
over
the
ice
just
to
apologise
to
father
brachet
for
being
pymeuts
this
other
this
white
man
penance
might
would
involve
a
greater
mortification
of
the
flesh
what
then
the
reward
was
proportionate
plenty
of
gold
the
faint
whisper
filled
the
air
a
little
more
hardship
and
the
long
process
of
is
shortened
to
a
few
months
no
more
office
grind
no
more
anxiety
for
those
one
loves
gold
plenty
of
gold
while
one
is
young
and
can
spend
it
gaily
gold
to
buy
back
the
orange
grove
to
buy
freedom
and
power
to
buy
wings
and
to
buy
happiness
on
the
stairs
they
passed
brother
paul
and
the
native
supper
in
five
minutes
father
the
superior
nodded
there
is
a
great
deal
to
do
the
native
went
on
hurriedly
to
paul
we
got
to
bury
catherine
and
this
man
from
min√≥ok
agreed
paul
pausing
with
his
hand
on
the
door
chapter
vii
kaviak
crime
my
little
son
who
look
from
thoughtful
eyes
and
moved
and
spoke
in
quiet
wise
having
my
law
the
seventh
time
disobey
i
struck
him
and
with
hard
words
and
unkiss
even
with
the
plague
and
brother
paul
raging
at
the
mission
even
with
everyone
preoccupied
by
the
claims
of
dead
and
dying
the
boy
would
have
been
glad
to
prolong
his
stay
had
it
not
been
for
nagging
thoughts
of
the
colonel
as
it
was
with
the
mercury
rapidly
rising
and
the
wind
fallen
he
got
the
pymeuts
on
the
trail
next
day
at
noon
spent
what
was
left
of
the
night
at
the
kachime
and
set
off
for
camp
early
the
following
day
he
arrived
something
of
a
wreck
and
with
an
enormous
respect
for
the
yukon
trail
it
did
him
good
to
sight
the
big
chimney
and
still
more
to
see
the
big
colonel
putting
on
his
near
the
bottom
of
the
hill
where
the
cabin
trail
met
the
river
trail
when
the
boss
o
the
camp
looked
up
and
saw
the
prodigal
coming
along
rather
groggy
on
his
legs
he
just
stood
still
a
moment
then
he
kicked
off
his
turned
back
a
few
paces
uphill
and
sat
down
on
a
spruce
stump
folded
his
arms
and
waited
was
it
the
knapsack
on
his
back
that
bowed
him
so
hello
kentucky
but
the
colonel
did
look
up
till
the
boy
got
quite
near
chanting
in
his
tuneless
voice
on
a
swee
vine
swee
vine
swee
vine
what
the
matter
hey
colonel
sorry
as
all
that
to
see
me
back
reckon
it
the
kind
o
sorrah
i
can
bear
said
the
colonel
we
thought
you
were
dead
you
ought
t
known
me
better
were
you
just
sendin
out
a
of
one
the
colonel
nodded
that
party
would
have
started
before
but
i
cut
my
foot
with
the
axe
the
day
you
left
where
have
you
been
in
the
name
the
nation
pymeut
an
holy
cross
holy
cross
holy
moses
yes
and
do
you
know
one
thing
i
saw
there
gave
me
a
serious
nervous
shock
that
do
surprise
me
what
was
it
sheets
when
i
came
to
go
to
bed
a
real
bed
colonel
on
legs
i
found
i
was
expected
to
sleep
between
sheets
and
i
just
about
fainted
that
the
only
shock
you
had
no
i
had
several
i
saw
an
angel
i
tell
you
straight
colonel
you
can
bank
on
what
i
sayin
that
jesuit
outfit
all
right
oh
you
think
so
the
rejoinder
came
a
little
sharply
yes
sir
i
just
do
i
think
i
be
bigoted
not
to
admit
it
so
you
be
thick
as
peas
in
a
pod
with
the
priests
now
well
i
the
one
that
can
afford
to
be
they
wo
convert
and
from
my
point
o
view
it
do
matter
what
a
man
is
s
long
he
a
decent
fella
the
colonel
only
answer
was
to
plunge
obliquely
uphill
say
boss
wait
for
me
the
colonel
looked
back
the
boy
was
holding
on
to
a
scrub
willow
that
put
up
wiry
twigs
above
the
snow
feel
as
if
i
never
get
up
the
last
rungs
o
this
darn
tired
h
something
of
a
walk
to
holy
cross
even
on
a
nice
mild
day
like
this
the
colonel
made
the
reflection
with
obvious
satisfaction
took
off
his
knapsack
and
sat
down
again
the
boy
did
the
same
the
very
day
you
lit
out
father
orloff
came
up
from
the
russian
mission
what
he
like
oh
little
fella
in
petticoats
with
a
beard
an
a
high
like
a
russian
and
that
same
afternoon
we
had
a
trader
fella
here
with
two
white
men
since
that
day
we
have
seen
a
human
creature
we
bought
some
furs
of
the
trader
where
you
get
yours
pymeut
any
news
about
the
strike
well
the
trader
fella
was
sure
it
was
all
gammon
and
told
us
stories
of
men
who
sacrificed
everything
and
joined
a
stampede
and
got
sold
sold
badly
but
the
two
crazy
whites
with
him
miners
from
dakotah
they
were
on
fire
about
min√≥ok
kept
on
bragging
they
cold
feet
and
swore
they
get
near
to
the
diggins
as
their
take
the
said
they
might
do
a
hundred
miles
more
but
probably
would
get
beyond
anvik
crazy
fools
i
tell
you
to
travel
even
thirty
miles
on
the
yukon
in
winter
even
with
a
bully
team
and
old
nick
to
drive
and
not
an
extra
ounce
on
your
back
i
tell
you
colonel
it
no
joke
you
sonny
it
was
thirty
seconds
before
sonny
was
adding
did
that
think
it
was
any
use
our
trying
to
get
dogs
ai
to
be
had
now
for
love
or
money
lord
colonel
if
we
had
a
team
yes
i
know
we
probably
owe
our
lives
to
the
fact
that
we
have
it
suddenly
occurred
to
the
boy
that
although
he
had
just
done
a
pretty
good
tramp
and
felt
he
rather
die
than
go
fifty
feet
further
it
was
the
colonel
who
was
most
tired
how
everybody
oh
i
we
might
all
of
us
be
worse
off
what
the
matter
he
was
so
long
answering
that
the
boy
eyes
turned
to
follow
the
serious
outward
gaze
of
the
older
man
even
before
he
lifted
one
hand
and
swept
it
down
the
hill
and
out
across
the
dim
grey
prospect
this
said
the
colonel
their
eyes
had
dropped
down
that
last
stretch
of
the
steep
snow
slope
across
the
two
miles
of
frozen
river
and
ran
half
round
the
wide
like
creatures
in
a
cage
whether
they
liked
it
or
whether
they
did
for
them
there
was
no
way
out
it
the
awful
stillness
the
colonel
arraigned
the
distant
they
sat
there
looking
listening
as
if
they
hoped
their
protest
might
bring
some
signal
of
relenting
no
creature
not
even
a
nothing
on
all
the
earth
stirred
by
as
much
as
a
hair
no
mark
of
man
past
or
present
broke
the
grey
monotony
no
sound
but
their
two
voices
disturbed
the
stillness
of
the
world
it
was
a
quiet
that
penetrated
that
pricked
to
vague
alarm
already
both
knew
the
sting
of
it
well
it
the
kind
of
thing
that
gets
on
a
fella
nerves
said
the
colonel
i
do
know
as
i
ever
felt
helpless
in
any
part
of
the
world
before
but
a
man
counts
for
precious
little
up
here
do
you
notice
how
you
come
to
listen
to
the
silence
oh
yes
i
noticed
stop
again
he
lifted
his
hand
and
they
strained
their
ears
done
that
by
the
hour
since
you
left
and
the
daft
went
up
trail
after
you
the
other
fellas
feel
it
too
do
know
what
have
done
without
kaviak
think
we
ought
to
keep
that
kid
you
know
i
could
get
on
without
kaviak
if
only
we
had
some
light
it
this
villainous
twilight
that
gets
into
my
head
all
the
same
you
know
he
stood
up
suddenly
we
came
expecting
to
stand
a
lot
did
we
the
elder
man
nodded
big
game
big
stakes
it
all
right
eventless
enough
after
this
except
for
the
passing
of
an
indian
or
two
the
days
crawled
by
the
boy
would
get
up
first
in
the
morning
rake
out
the
dead
ashes
put
on
a
couple
of
bank
them
with
ashes
and
then
build
the
fire
in
front
he
broke
the
ice
in
the
and
washed
filled
and
with
water
or
ice
and
swung
them
over
the
fire
then
he
mixed
the
put
it
in
the
dutch
oven
covered
it
with
coals
and
left
it
to
get
on
with
its
baking
sometimes
this
part
of
the
programme
was
varied
by
his
mixing
a
on
a
board
and
setting
it
up
to
do
in
front
of
the
fire
then
he
would
call
the
colonel
up
massa
de
day
am
breakin
peas
in
de
pot
en
de
bakin
for
it
was
the
colonel
affair
to
take
up
proceedings
at
this
point
make
the
coffee
and
the
mush
and
keep
it
from
burning
fry
the
bacon
and
serve
up
breakfast
saturday
brought
a
slight
variation
in
the
early
morning
routine
the
others
came
straggling
in
as
usual
but
once
a
week
mac
was
sure
to
be
first
for
he
had
to
get
kaviak
up
mac
view
of
his
whole
duty
to
man
seemed
to
centre
in
the
saturday
scrubbing
of
kaviak
vainly
had
the
esquimer
stood
out
against
compliance
with
this
most
repulsive
of
foreign
customs
he
seemed
to
be
always
ready
with
some
scheme
for
turning
the
edge
of
mac
iron
resolution
he
tried
hiding
at
the
bottom
of
the
bed
it
did
work
the
next
time
he
crouched
far
back
under
the
lower
bunk
he
was
dragged
out
another
saturday
he
embedded
himself
like
a
moth
in
a
bundle
of
old
clothes
mac
shook
him
out
he
had
been
very
sanguine
the
day
he
hid
in
the
library
this
was
a
wooden
box
nailed
to
the
wall
on
the
right
of
the
door
most
of
the
bigger
books
byron
wordsworth
dana
mineralogy
and
two
bibles
he
had
taken
out
and
concealed
in
the
lower
bunk
very
skilfully
far
back
behind
the
colonel
feet
copps
mining
and
the
two
works
on
parliamentary
law
piled
at
the
end
of
the
box
served
as
a
pillow
after
climbing
in
and
folding
himself
up
into
an
incredibly
small
space
kaviak
managed
with
superhuman
skill
to
cover
himself
neatly
with
a
patchwork
quilt
of
scribner
century
and
for
august
no
one
would
suspect
glancing
into
that
library
that
underneath
the
usual
top
layer
of
light
reading
was
matter
less
august
than
law
poetry
science
and
revelation
it
was
the
base
byron
tipping
the
wink
to
mac
out
of
the
back
of
the
bunk
that
betrayed
kaviak
it
became
evident
that
farva
began
to
take
a
dour
pride
in
the
perseverance
one
morning
he
even
pointed
out
to
the
camp
the
strong
likeness
between
kaviak
and
robert
bruce
no
sah
the
scottish
chief
had
to
have
an
but
kaviak
lawd
kaviak
could
give
points
to
any
spider
livin
this
was
on
the
morning
that
the
esquimer
thought
to
escape
scrubbing
even
at
the
peril
of
his
life
by
getting
up
on
to
the
how
no
man
ever
knew
but
there
he
sat
in
terror
like
a
very
young
monkey
in
a
tree
hardly
daring
to
breathe
his
arms
clasped
tight
round
the
demijohn
but
having
mac
to
deal
with
the
end
of
it
was
that
he
always
got
washed
and
equally
always
he
seemed
to
register
a
vow
that
him
heaven
it
should
never
happen
again
after
breakfast
came
the
clearing
up
it
should
have
been
done
under
this
r√©gime
by
the
little
cabin
men
but
it
seldom
was
was
expected
to
keep
the
in
the
river
chopped
open
and
to
bring
up
water
every
day
this
did
always
happen
either
though
to
drink
was
to
invite
scurvy
father
wills
said
there
was
also
a
daily
need
if
the
colonel
could
be
believed
for
everybody
to
chop
firewood
we
got
enough
was
potts
invariable
opinion
for
how
long
we
get
scurvy
and
ca
work
we
freeze
to
death
in
a
fortnight
never
saw
a
fireplace
swalla
logs
whole
an
never
blink
like
this
one
but
you
got
no
objection
to
sittin
by
while
the
goes
on
the
colonel
or
the
boy
cooked
the
eternal
beans
bacon
and
mush
dinner
after
whatever
desultory
work
was
done
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
extraordinarily
little
to
occupy
five
men
the
fun
of
mitigated
by
frostbite
quickly
degenerated
from
a
sport
into
a
mere
means
of
locomotion
one
or
two
of
the
party
went
hunting
now
and
then
for
the
scarce
squirrel
and
the
shy
ptarmigan
they
tried
with
signal
lack
of
success
to
catch
fish
indian
fashion
through
a
hole
in
the
ice
but
for
the
most
part
as
winter
darkened
round
them
they
lounged
from
morning
till
night
about
the
big
fireplace
and
smoked
and
growled
and
played
cards
and
lived
as
men
do
finding
out
a
deal
about
each
other
characters
something
about
each
other
opinions
and
little
or
nothing
about
each
other
history
in
the
appalling
stillness
of
the
long
arctic
night
any
was
hailed
with
enthusiasm
and
although
the
in
the
big
cabin
was
plainly
going
to
run
short
before
spring
no
traveller
white
indian
or
esquimaux
was
allowed
to
go
by
without
being
warmed
and
fed
and
made
to
tell
where
he
came
from
and
whither
he
was
bound
questions
to
tax
the
sage
their
unfailing
hospitality
was
not
in
the
least
unexpected
or
unusual
being
a
virtue
practised
even
by
scoundrels
in
the
great
but
it
strained
the
resources
of
the
little
camp
a
fourth
of
whose
outfit
lay
under
the
yukon
ice
in
the
state
of
lowered
vitality
to
which
the
poor
food
the
cold
and
lack
of
exercise
was
slowly
reducing
them
they
talked
to
one
another
less
and
less
as
time
went
on
and
more
and
more
silently
and
each
against
his
will
grew
to
the
shortcomings
and
even
to
the
innocent
ways
of
the
other
fellow
not
mac
inertia
alone
but
his
trick
of
sticking
out
his
jaw
became
an
offence
his
rasping
voice
a
torture
the
boy
occasional
ebullition
of
spirits
was
an
outrage
the
colonel
mere
size
intolerable
brogue
which
had
amused
them
grew
to
be
just
part
of
the
hardship
and
barbarism
that
had
overtaken
them
like
an
evil
dream
coercing
subduing
all
the
forces
of
life
only
kaviak
seemed
likely
to
come
unscathed
through
the
ordeal
of
the
winter
captivity
only
he
could
take
the
best
place
at
the
fire
the
best
morsel
at
dinner
and
not
stir
angry
passions
only
he
dared
rouse
mac
when
the
nova
scotian
fell
into
one
of
his
moods
kaviak
put
a
stop
to
his
staring
angrily
by
the
hour
into
the
fire
and
set
him
to
whittling
out
boats
and
a
top
thereby
providing
occupation
for
the
morrow
since
it
was
one
man
work
to
break
kaviak
of
spinning
the
one
on
the
table
during
mealtime
and
sailing
the
other
in
the
bucket
at
all
times
when
older
eyes
were
watching
the
colonel
wrote
up
his
journal
and
read
the
midsummer
magazines
and
byron
in
the
face
of
mac
i
do
not
like
byron
thought
i
do
not
consider
him
healthy
or
instructive
in
one
of
his
more
energetic
moods
the
colonel
made
a
cricket
for
kaviak
who
preferred
it
to
the
high
stool
and
always
sat
on
it
except
at
meals
once
in
a
while
when
for
hours
no
word
had
been
spoken
except
some
broken
reference
to
a
royal
flush
or
a
or
had
said
bedad
i
go
it
alone
or
potts
had
inquired
anxiously
got
the
joker
guess
i
euchred
then
the
boy
in
desperation
would
catch
up
kaviak
balance
the
child
on
his
head
or
execute
some
other
gymnastic
soothing
the
solemn
little
heathen
ruffled
feelings
afterwards
by
crooning
out
a
monotonous
plantation
song
it
was
that
kind
of
addition
to
the
general
gloom
that
at
first
would
fire
to
raise
his
own
spirits
at
least
by
roaring
out
an
irish
ditty
but
this
was
seldomer
as
time
went
on
even
jimmie
brogue
suffered
and
grew
less
robust
in
a
depressed
sort
of
way
mac
was
openly
teaching
kaviak
his
letters
and
surreptitiously
down
in
the
little
cabin
his
prayers
he
was
very
angry
when
potts
and
eavesdropped
and
roared
at
struggles
with
ow
farva
in
fact
kaviak
did
not
shine
as
a
student
of
civilisation
though
that
told
less
against
him
with
than
the
fact
that
he
was
jolly
and
jump
about
like
white
children
moreover
jimmie
swore
there
was
something
bogey
about
the
intermittent
knowledge
of
english
often
for
days
he
would
utter
nothing
but
farva
or
maw
when
he
wanted
his
plate
replenished
then
suddenly
he
would
say
something
that
nobody
could
remember
having
taught
him
or
even
said
in
his
presence
it
was
not
to
be
denied
that
kaviak
loved
sugar
mightily
and
stole
it
when
he
could
mac
lectured
him
and
slapped
his
minute
yellow
hands
and
kaviak
stole
it
all
the
same
when
he
was
bad
that
is
when
he
had
eaten
his
daily
fill
of
the
camp
scanty
store
in
such
a
little
place
it
was
not
easy
to
hide
from
such
a
hunter
as
kaviak
he
was
taken
down
to
the
little
cabin
smacked
and
made
to
say
ow
farva
nobody
could
discover
that
he
minded
much
though
he
learnt
to
try
to
shorten
the
ceremony
by
saying
i
solly
all
the
way
to
the
cabin
as
a
rule
he
was
strangely
undemonstrative
but
in
his
own
grave
little
fashion
he
conducted
life
with
no
small
intelligence
and
learned
with
an
almost
uncanny
quickness
each
man
uses
from
the
kaviak
point
of
view
the
only
person
he
was
sworn
friends
with
was
the
and
there
came
to
be
a
legend
current
in
the
camp
that
kaviak
first
attempt
at
spontaneously
stringing
a
sentence
under
that
roof
was
me
got
no
use
for
potts
the
best
thing
about
kaviak
was
that
his
was
no
craven
soul
he
was
obliged
to
steal
the
sugar
because
he
lived
with
white
people
who
were
bigger
than
he
and
who
always
took
it
away
when
they
caught
him
but
once
the
sugar
was
safe
under
his
shirt
he
owned
up
without
the
smallest
hesitation
and
took
his
smacking
like
a
man
for
the
rest
he
flourished
filled
out
and
got
as
fat
as
a
seal
but
never
a
whit
less
solemn
one
morning
the
colonel
announced
that
now
the
days
had
grown
so
short
and
the
trio
were
so
late
coming
to
breakfast
and
nobody
did
any
work
to
speak
of
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
have
only
two
meals
a
day
the
motion
was
excessively
unpopular
but
it
was
carried
by
a
plain
and
somewhat
alarming
exposition
of
the
state
of
supplies
we
ought
to
need
as
much
food
when
we
lazy
round
the
fire
all
day
said
the
colonel
but
potts
retorted
that
they
need
a
lot
more
if
they
went
on
adoptin
the
aborigines
they
knocked
off
supper
and
all
but
the
aborigine
knew
what
it
meant
sometimes
to
go
hungry
to
bed
towards
the
end
of
dinner
one
day
late
in
december
when
everybody
else
had
finished
except
for
coffee
and
pipe
the
aborigine
held
up
his
empty
plate
have
you
had
enough
asked
the
colonel
mildly
surprised
at
kaviak
bottomless
capacity
maw
still
the
plate
was
extended
there
is
a
drop
of
syrup
left
said
potts
who
had
drained
the
can
and
even
wiped
it
out
carefully
with
halves
of
hot
biscuit
he
do
really
want
it
must
open
a
fresh
can
till
no
we
only
got
besides
he
bust
kaviak
meanwhile
during
this
paltry
discussion
had
stood
up
on
the
high
stool
farva
had
made
for
him
and
personally
inspected
the
big
then
he
turned
to
mac
and
pointing
a
finger
like
a
straw
nothing
could
fatten
those
infinitesimal
hands
he
said
gravely
and
fluently
maw
in
de
yes
maw
mush
but
no
maw
syrup
the
round
eyes
travelled
to
the
store
corner
we
have
to
open
a
fresh
can
some
time
what
the
odds
mac
got
up
and
not
only
kaviak
watched
him
for
syrup
was
a
luxury
not
expected
every
day
every
neck
had
craned
every
pair
of
eyes
had
followed
anxiously
to
that
row
of
rapidly
diminishing
tins
all
that
was
left
of
the
things
they
all
liked
best
and
they
still
this
side
of
christmas
what
you
about
mac
snapped
at
the
boy
as
he
came
back
with
the
fresh
supply
this
unprovoked
attack
was
ample
evidence
that
mac
was
uneasy
under
the
eyes
of
the
camp
angry
at
his
own
weakness
and
therefore
the
readier
to
dare
anybody
to
find
fault
with
him
how
can
i
help
watchin
you
said
the
boy
mac
lifted
his
eyes
fiercely
i
fascinated
by
your
winnin
ways
we
all
like
that
kaviak
had
meanwhile
made
a
prosperous
voyage
to
the
and
returned
to
mac
side
an
absurd
little
figure
in
a
strange
cassock
buttoned
from
top
to
bottom
a
waistcoat
of
mac
and
a
jacket
of
the
boy
which
was
usually
falling
off
and
trailed
on
the
ground
when
it
was
and
whose
sleeves
were
rolled
up
in
inconvenient
muffs
still
with
a
gravity
that
did
not
seem
impaired
by
these
details
he
stood
clutching
his
plate
anxiously
with
both
hands
while
down
upon
the
descended
a
slender
golden
thread
manipulated
with
a
fine
skill
to
make
the
most
of
its
sweetness
it
curled
and
spiralled
and
described
the
kind
of
involved
and
flourishes
which
the
grave
and
reverend
of
a
hundred
years
ago
wrote
jauntily
underneath
the
most
sober
names
lovingly
the
dark
eyes
watched
the
engrossing
process
even
when
the
attenuated
thread
was
broken
and
the
golden
rain
descended
in
slow
infrequent
drops
kaviak
stood
waiting
always
for
just
one
drop
more
that
enough
greedy
now
go
away
and
gobble
but
kaviak
daintily
skimmed
off
the
syrupy
top
and
left
his
mush
almost
as
high
a
hill
as
before
it
was
long
after
the
dinner
things
had
been
washed
up
and
the
colonel
settled
down
to
the
magazines
he
was
reading
the
advertisements
now
that
potts
drew
out
his
watch
golly
do
you
fellers
know
what
it
is
he
held
the
open
timepiece
up
to
mac
hardly
middle
o
the
afternoon
all
these
hours
before
bedtime
and
nothin
to
eat
till
why
you
just
finished
but
look
at
the
the
colonel
said
nothing
maybe
he
had
been
a
little
previous
with
dinner
today
it
was
such
a
relief
to
get
it
out
of
the
way
oppressive
as
the
silence
was
the
sound
of
potts
voice
was
worse
and
as
he
kept
on
about
how
many
hours
it
would
be
till
breakfast
the
colonel
said
to
the
boy
get
your
gun
and
we
go
out
in
these
december
days
before
the
watery
sun
had
set
the
great
moon
arose
having
now
in
her
resplendent
fulness
quite
the
air
of
snuffing
out
the
sun
the
pale
and
day
was
put
to
shame
by
this
brilliant
that
could
cast
such
heavy
shadows
and
by
which
men
might
read
the
instant
the
big
cabin
door
was
opened
kaviak
darted
out
between
the
colonel
legs
threw
up
his
head
like
a
siwash
dog
sniffed
at
the
frosty
air
and
the
big
orange
moon
flung
up
his
heels
and
tore
down
to
the
forbidden
the
fascinating
if
he
had
got
snared
in
his
trailing
coat
he
would
have
won
that
race
when
the
two
hunters
had
captured
kaviak
and
shut
him
indoors
they
acted
on
his
implied
suggestion
that
the
ought
to
be
examined
they
chopped
away
the
ice
empty
as
usual
it
had
been
very
nice
and
neighbourly
of
nicholas
as
long
ago
as
the
of
december
to
bring
the
big
new
trap
down
on
his
sled
on
the
way
to
the
ikogimeut
festival
it
had
taken
a
long
time
to
cut
through
the
thick
ice
to
drive
in
the
poles
and
fasten
the
slight
fencing
in
such
relation
to
the
mouth
of
the
sunken
trap
that
all
fish
ought
easily
to
find
their
way
thither
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
did
potts
said
it
was
because
the
boy
was
always
hauling
out
the
trap
to
see
but
what
good
would
it
be
to
have
it
full
of
fish
and
not
know
they
had
been
out
about
an
hour
when
the
colonel
brought
down
a
ptarmigan
and
said
he
was
ready
to
go
home
the
boy
hesitated
going
to
give
in
and
cook
that
bird
for
supper
it
was
a
tempting
proposition
but
the
colonel
said
rather
sharply
no
sir
got
to
keep
him
for
a
christmas
turkey
well
i
just
see
if
i
can
make
it
a
brace
the
colonel
went
home
hung
his
trophy
outside
to
freeze
and
found
the
trio
had
decamped
to
the
little
cabin
he
glanced
up
anxiously
to
see
if
the
demijohn
was
on
the
shelf
yes
and
kaviak
sound
asleep
in
the
bottom
bunk
the
colonel
would
climb
up
and
have
forty
winks
in
the
top
one
before
the
boy
got
in
for
their
game
of
chess
he
did
know
how
long
he
had
slept
when
a
faint
scratching
pricked
through
the
veil
of
slumber
and
he
said
to
himself
kaviak
on
a
raid
again
but
he
was
too
sodden
with
sleep
to
investigate
just
before
he
dropped
off
again
however
opening
a
heavy
eye
he
saw
potts
go
by
the
bunk
stop
at
the
door
and
listen
then
he
passed
the
bunk
again
and
the
faint
noise
recommenced
the
colonel
dropped
back
into
the
gulf
of
sleep
never
even
woke
for
his
chess
and
in
the
morning
the
incident
had
passed
out
of
his
mind
just
before
dinner
the
next
day
the
boy
called
out
see
here
who
spilt
the
syrup
spilt
it
syrup
no
it
do
seem
to
be
spilt
either
he
patted
the
ground
with
his
hand
you
do
mean
that
new
can
not
a
drop
in
it
he
turned
it
upside
down
every
eye
went
to
kaviak
he
was
sitting
on
his
cricket
by
the
fire
waiting
for
dinner
he
returned
the
accusing
looks
of
the
company
with
come
here
he
got
up
and
trotted
over
to
farva
have
you
been
to
the
syrup
kaviak
shook
his
head
you
have
been
no
you
sure
he
nodded
how
did
it
go
all
away
do
you
know
again
the
silent
denial
kaviak
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
dinner
preparations
and
then
went
back
to
his
cricket
it
was
the
best
place
from
which
to
keep
a
strict
eye
on
the
cook
the
gintlemin
do
feel
conversaytional
wid
a
pint
o
surrup
in
his
inside
i
tell
you
he
be
currled
up
with
colic
if
he
well
said
hopefully
bide
a
bit
he
ai
lookin
very
brash
come
here
kaviak
got
up
a
second
time
but
with
less
alacrity
have
you
got
a
pain
he
stared
does
it
hurt
you
there
kaviak
doubled
up
suddenly
he
awful
ticklish
said
the
boy
mac
frowned
with
perplexity
and
kaviak
retired
to
the
cricket
does
the
can
leak
anywhere
that
excuse
wo
hold
water
the
can
will
the
colonel
had
just
applied
the
test
besides
it
would
have
leaked
on
to
something

pretty
serious
remarked
the
colonel
we
ca
afford
to

pint
o
syrup

thing
about
kaviak
said
the
boy
he
always
owns
up
look
here
kiddie
do
say
no
do
shake
your
head
till
you
thought
now
think
kaviak
air
of
profound
meditation
seemed
to
fill
every
requirement
did
you
take
the
awful
good
syrup
and
eat
it
up
kaviak
was
in
the
middle
of
a
when
he
stopped
abruptly
the
boy
had
said
he
was
to
do
that
nobody
had
seemed
pleased
when
he
said
no
i
we
on
the
right
track
he
remembering
think
again
you
are
a
man
at
finding
sugar
are
you
yes
fin
shugh
kaviak
modestly
admitted
his
prowess
in
that
direction
and
you
get
hungry
in
the
early
morning
yes
he
would
go
so
far
as
to
admit
that
he
did
you
go
skylarkin
about
and
you
remember
the
syrup
can
and
you
get
hold
of
it
did
you
you
mean
yesterday
this
morning
n
sh
kaviak
blinked
wait
and
think
yesterday
this
was
full
you
remember
mac
opened
it
for
you
kaviak
nodded
and
now
you
see
he
turned
the
can
bottom
side
up
all
gone
murmured
kaviak
with
an
accent
of
polite
regret
then
with
recovered
cheerfulness
he
pointed
to
the
store
corner
maw
potts
laughed
in
his
irritating
way
and
mac
face
got
red
things
began
to
look
black
for
kaviak
say
fellas
see
here
the
boy
hammered
the
lid
on
the
can
with
his
fist
and
then
held
it
out
it
was
put
away
shut
up
for
i
shut
it
and
even
one
of
us
ca
get
that
lid
off
without
a
knife
or
something
to
pry
it
the
company
looked
at
the
small
hands
doubtfully
they
were
none
too
little
for
many
a
forbidden
feat
how
had
he
got
on
the
how
ye
see
crayther
it
must
uv
been
yersilf
becuz
there
is
annybuddy
else
look
here
said
the
colonel
we
forgive
you
this
time
if
own
up
just
tell
us
kaviak
again
that
journey
from
the
cricket
to
the
show
us
mac
had
taken
the
shut
tin
and
now
held
it
out
show
us
how
you
got
the
lid
off
but
kaviak
turned
away
mac
seized
him
by
the
shoulder
and
jerked
him
round
everyone
felt
it
to
be
suspicious
that
kaviak
was
unwilling
even
to
try
to
open
the
all
too
attractive
can
was
he
really
cunning
and
did
he
want
not
to
give
himself
away
was
he
said
to
be
much
older
than
he
looked
and
did
he
sometimes
look
a
hundred
and
wise
for
his
years
see
here
i
have
caught
you
in
a
lie
yet
but
if
i
do
kaviak
stared
drew
a
long
breath
and
seemed
to
retire
within
himself
you
better
attend
to
me
for
i
mean
business
kaviak
recalled
from
internal
communing
studied
farva
a
moment
and
then
retreated
to
the
cricket
as
to
a
haven
now
hastily
and
with
misgiving
tripping
over
his
trailing
coat
mac
stood
up
wait
old
man
the
colonel
stooped
his
big
body
till
he
was
on
a
level
with
the
staring
round
eyes
yo
see
child
yo
ca
have
any
dinnah
till
we
find
out
who
took
the
syrup
the
little
yellow
face
was
very
serious
he
turned
and
looked
at
the
still
smoking
are
yoh
hungry
he
nodded
got
up
briskly
held
up
his
train
and
dragged
his
high
stool
to
the
table
scrambled
up
and
established
himself
look
at
that
said
the
colonel
triumphantly
that
youngster
just
eaten
a
pint
o
syrup
mac
was
coming
slowly
up
behind
kaviak
with
a
face
that
nobody
liked
looking
at
oh
let
the
brat
alone
and
let
get
to
our
grub
said
potts
with
an
extreme
nervous
irritation
mac
swept
kaviak
off
the
stool
you
come
with
me
only
one
person
spoke
after
that
till
the
meal
was
nearly
done
that
one
had
said
yes
farva
and
followed
mac
dinnerless
out
to
the
little
cabin
the
colonel
set
aside
a
plateful
for
each
of
the
two
absent
ones
and
cleared
away
the
things
potts
stirred
the
fire
in
a
shower
of
sparks
picked
up
a
book
and
flung
it
down
searched
through
the
for
something
that
was
lost
and
then
went
to
the
door
to
look
at
the
weather
so
he
said
sat
dozing
by
the
fire
he
was
in
the
way
of
the
stir
your
stumps
jimmie
said
the
colonel
and
get
us
a
bucket
of
water
sleepily
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
he
be
damned
if
he
did
with
alacrity
i
go
said
potts
the
colonel
stared
at
him
and
by
some
trick
of
the
brain
he
had
a
vision
of
potts
listening
at
the
door
the
night
before
and
then
resuming
that
clinking
scratching
sound
in
the
corner
the
store
corner
hand
me
over
my
parki
will
you
potts
said
to
the
boy
he
pulled
it
over
his
head
picked
up
the
bucket
and
went
out
seems
kind
o
restless
do
he
yes
colonel
hey
nothin
ten
minutes
a
quarter
of
an
hour
went
by
funny
mac
do

for
his
dinner

i
go
and
look
up

not
far
from
the
door
he
met
mac
coming
in
well
said
the
boy
meaning
where
the
kid
well
mac
echoed
defiantly
i
lammed
him
as
i
have
lammed
robert
bruce
if
he
lied
to
me
the
boy
stared
at
this
sudden
incursion
into
history
but
all
he
said
was
your
dinner
waitin
the
minute
mac
got
inside
he
looked
round
hungrily
for
the
child
not
seeing
him
he
went
over
and
scrutinised
the
tumbled
contents
of
the
bunks
where
kaviak
you
tell
us
you
mean
he
is
here
mac
wheeled
round
sharply
he
did
come
back
here
for
his
dinner
have
seen
him
since
you
took
him
out
mac
made
for
the
door
the
boy
followed
kaviak
each
called
in
turn
it
was
quite
light
enough
to
see
if
he
were
anywhere
about
although
the
watery
sun
had
sunk
full
half
an
hour
before
the
fantastically
huge
hung
like
a
copper
shield
on
a
wall
do
you
see
anything
whispered
mac
no
who
that
yonder
potts
gettin
water
the
boy
was
bending
down
looking
for
tracks
mac
looked
too
but
ineffectually
feverishly
is
potts
calling
i
knew
he
would
if
he
saw
us
he
never
carried
a
bucket
uphill
yet
without
help
see
there
are
the
kid
tracks
going
we
must
find
some
turned
the
other
way
they
were
near
the
little
cabin
now
here
shouted
the
boy
and
yes
here
again
and
so
it
was
clean
and
neatly
printed
in
the
last
light
snowfall
showed
the
little
footprints
we
on
the
right
trail
now
kaviak
through
his
parki
the
boy
felt
a
hand
close
on
his
shoulder
and
a
voice
not
like
maccann
goin
straight
down
to
the
hole
the
two
dashed
forward
down
the
steep
hill
the
boy
saying
breathless
as
they
went
and
potts
where
potts
he
had
vanished
but
there
was
no
time
to
consider
how
or
where
kaviak
kaviak
and
as
they
got
to
the
river
think
i
hear
so
do
i
coming
coming
hold
on
tight
coming
kaviak
they
made
straight
for
the
big
open
farther
away
from
the
little
cabin
and
nearer
the
bank
was
the
small
between
the
two
they
noticed
as
they
raced
by
the
hung
on
that
heavy
piece
of
driftwood
that
had
frozen
aslant
in
the
river
mac
saw
that
the
was
taut
and
that
it
ran
along
the
ice
and
disappeared
behind
the
big
funnel
of
the
the
sound
was
unmistakable
now
a
faint
choked
voice
calling
out
of
the
hole
help
coming
hold
tight
half
a
minute
and
how
it
was
done
or
who
did
it
nobody
quite
knew
but
potts
still
clinging
by
one
hand
to
the
was
hauled
out
and
laid
on
the
ice
before
it
was
discovered
that
he
had
kaviak
under
his
arm
kaviak
stark
and
unconscious
with
the
round
eyes
rolled
back
till
one
saw
the
whites
and
nothing
more
mac
picked
the
body
up
and
held
it
head
downwards
laid
it
flat
again
and
stripping
off
the
great
sodden
jacket
already
beginning
to
freeze
fell
to
putting
kaviak
through
the
action
of
artificial
breathing
we
must
get
them
up
to
the
cabin
first
thing
said
the
boy
but
mac
seemed
not
to
hear
do
you
see
kaviak
face
is
freezing
still
mac
paid
no
heed
potts
lifted
a
stiff
uncertain
hand
and
with
a
groan
let
it
fall
heavily
on
his
own
cheek
come
on
i
help
you
in
anyhow
potts
ca
walk
in
this
damned
wet
fur
with
some
difficulty
having
dragged
off
potts
soaked
parki
already
stiffening
unmanageably
the
boy
tried
to
get
him
on
his
feet
once
you
in
the
cabin
you
all
right
but
the
benumbed
and
miserable
potts
kept
his
eyes
on
kaviak
as
if
hypnotised
by
the
strange
new
in
the
little
face
well
i
ca
carry
you
up
said
the
boy
and
after
a
second
he
began
to
rub
potts
furiously
glancing
over
now
and
then
to
see
if
kaviak
was
coming
to
while
mac
dumb
and
tense
laboured
on
without
success
potts
under
the
boy
ministering
showed
himself
restored
enough
to
swear
feebly
my
man
comin
round
how
yours
no
answer
but
he
could
see
that
the
sweat
poured
off
mac
face
as
he
worked
unceasingly
over
the
child
the
boy
pulled
potts
into
a
sitting
posture
it
was
then
that
mac
without
looking
up
said
run
and
get
whiskey
run
like
hell
when
he
got
back
with
the
colonel
and
the
whiskey
floundering
in
the
distance
potts
was
feebly
striking
his
breast
with
his
arms
and
mac
still
bent
above
the
motionless
little
body
they
tried
to
get
some
of
the
spirit
down
the
child
throat
but
the
teeth
seemed
to
let
little
or
nothing
pass
the
stuff
ran
down
towards
his
ears
and
into
his
neck
but
mac
persisted
and
went
on
pouring
drop
by
drop
whenever
he
stopped
trying
to
restore
the
action
of
the
lungs
just
barely
managed
to
get
a
swig
for
potts
in
the
interval
though
they
all
began
to
feel
that
mac
was
working
to
bring
back
something
that
had
gone
for
ever
the
boy
went
and
bent
his
face
down
close
over
the
rigid
mouth
to
feel
for
the
breath
when
he
got
up
he
turned
away
sharply
and
stood
looking
through
tears
into
the
saying
to
himself
yukon
inua
has
taken
him
he
was
in
too
long
potts
teeth
were
chattering
and
he
looked
unspeakably
wretched
when
my
arm
got
numb
i
could
keep
his
head
up
and
he
swallowed
more
whiskey
you
fellers
ought
to
have
left
that
damn
trap
up
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
said
the
boy
guiltily
kaviak
knew
it
ought
to
be
catchin
fish
when
i
came
down
he
was
cryin
and
pullin
the
trap
backwards
towards
the
hole
then
he
slipped
come
mac
said
the
colonel
quietly
let
carry
the
little
man
to
the
cabin
no
no
not
yet
stuffy
heat
is
what
he
wants
and
he
worked
on
they
got
potts
up
on
his
feet
i
called
out
to
you
fellers
did
you
hear
me
but
we
did
understand
well
you
better
have
come
it
too
late
now
half
dragged
half
carried
him
up
to
the
cabin
for
he
seemed
unable
to
walk
in
his
frozen
trousers
the
colonel
and
the
boy
by
a
common
impulse
went
a
little
way
in
the
opposite
direction
across
the
ice
what
can
we
do
colonel
nothing
it
not
a
bit
o
use
they
turned
to
go
back
well
the
duckin
will
be
good
for
potts
parki
anyhow
said
the
boy
in
an
angry
and
unsteady
voice
what
do
you
mean
when
he
asked
me
to
hand
it
to
him
i
nearly
stuck
fast
to
it
it
all
over
syrup
and
we
do
wear
furs
at
our
meals
tchah
the
colonel
stopped
with
a
face
of
loathing
yes
he
was
the
only
one
of
us
that
did
bully
the
kid
could
go
far
but
could
own
up
potts
is
a
cur
yes
sah
then
after
an
instant
reflection
but
he
a
cur
that
can
risk
his
life
to
save
a
kid
he
do
care
a
damn
for
they
went
back
to
mac
and
found
him
pretty
well
worn
out
the
colonel
took
his
place
but
was
soon
pushed
away
mac
understood
better
he
said
had
once
brought
a
chap
round
that
everybody
said
was
dead
he
was
dead
the
great
thing
was
not
to
give
in
a
few
minutes
after
kaviak
eyelids
fluttered
and
came
down
over
the
upturned
eyeballs
mac
with
a
cry
that
brought
a
lump
to
the
throat
gathered
the
child
up
in
his
arms
and
ran
with
him
up
the
hill
to
the
cabin
three
hours
later
when
they
were
all
sitting
round
the
fire
kaviak
dosed
and
warm
and
asleep
in
the
lower
bunk
the
door
opened
and
in
walked
a
white
man
followed
by
an
indian
i
george
benham
they
had
all
heard
of
the
anvik
trader
a
man
of
some
wealth
and
influence
and
they
made
him
welcome
the
indian
was
his
guide
he
said
and
he
had
a
team
outside
of
seven
dogs
he
was
going
to
the
steamship
on
some
business
and
promised
father
wills
of
holy
cross
that
he
stop
on
the
way
and
deliver
a
letter
to
maccann
stop
on
the
way
i
should
think
so
we
were
goin
to
have
supper
anyhow
and
you
stay
and
sleep
here
all
mac
old
suspicions
of
the
jesuits
seemed
to
return
with
the
advent
of
that
letter
i
read
it
presently
he
laid
it
on
the
between
the
and
the
and
he
looked
at
it
angrily
every
now
and
then
while
he
helped
to
skin
benham
that
gentleman
had
thrown
back
his
hood
pulled
off
his
great
gauntlets
and
his
cap
and
now
with
a
little
help
dragged
the
drill
parki
over
his
head
and
after
that
the
fine
standing
revealed
at
last
as
a
fellow
of
or
so
in
a
suit
of
mackinaws
standing
six
feet
two
in
his
heelless
bring
in
my
traps
will
you
he
said
to
the
indian
and
then
relapsed
into
silence
the
indian
reappeared
with
his
arms
full
fine
lot
o
pelts
you
have
there
said
the
colonel
benham
did
answer
he
seemed
to
be
a
kind
of
a
chap
as
the
indian
sorted
and
piled
the
stuff
in
the
corner
potts
said
got
any
furs
you
want
to
sell
no
where
you
takin
down
to
the
all
this
stuff
for
rainey
benham
nodded
i
reckon
there
a
mistake
about
the
name
and
he
tom
thumb
or
commodore
nutt
the
boy
had
picked
up
a
little
parki
made
carefully
of
some
very
soft
dark
fur
and
trimmed
with
white
rabbit
the
small
hood
bordered
with
white
fox
that
a
neat
piece
of
work
said
the
colonel
benham
nodded
one
of
the
shageluk
squaws
can
do
that
sort
of
thing
what
the
fur
and
they
talked
of
the
weather
how
the
mercury
last
week
had
been
solid
in
the
thermometer
so
it
was
over
forty
degrees
anyhow
what
the
market
price
of
a
coat
like
that
mac
said
suddenly
that
is
a
coat
it
for
a
kid
of
rainey
back
in
the
states
still
mac
eyed
it
enviously
what
part
of
the
world

from
sir
said
the
colonel
when
they
had
drawn
up
to
the
supper
table
san
francisco
used
to
teach
numskulls
latin
and
mathematics
in
the
las
palmas
high
school
what
the
value
of
a
coat
like
that
little
one
interrupted
mac
oh

twenty
dollars
the
shageluks

that
much
benham
laughed
if
asked
the
shageluks
they
say

part
of
the
world

benham
shook
his
head
sorry
yes
it
queer
about
the
hold
this
country
gets
on
you
the
first
year
is
hell
the
second
is
purgatory
with
glimpses
of
something
else
the
third
well
more
and
more
forever
after
you
realise
the
north
taken
away
any
taste
you
ever
had
for
civilisation
that
when
you
got
the
hang
of
things
up
here
when
you
learned
not
to
stay
in
your
cabin
all
the
time
and
how
to
take
care
of
yourself
on
the
trail
but
as
for
going
back
to
the
boredom
of
cities
no
thank
you
mac
could
keep
his
eyes
off
the
little
coat
finally
to
enable
him
to
forget
it
as
it
seemed
he
got
up
and
opened
father
wills
letter
devoured
its
contents
in
silence
and
flung
it
down
on
the
table
the
colonel
took
it
up
and
read
aloud
the
father
thanks
for
all
the
white
camp
kindness
to
kaviak
and
now
that
the
sickness
was
about
gone
from
holy
cross
how
the
fathers
felt
that
they
must
relieve
their
neighbours
of
further
trouble
with
the
little
native
i
said
i
take
him
back
with
me
when
i
come
up
river
about
christmas
we
be
kind
o
lost
now
without
the
little
beggar
said
the
boy
glancing
sideways
at
mac
there
nothin
to
be
got
by
luggin
him
off
to
holy
cross
answered
that
gentleman
severely
unless
it
said
potts
he
all
right
in
the
he
got
said
mac
with
the
air
of
one
who
closes
an
argument
he
stood
up
worn
and
tired
and
looked
at
his
watch
you
ai
goin
to
bed
this
early
said
potts
quite
lively
and
recovered
from
his
cold
bath
that
was
the
worst
of
sleeping
in
the
little
cabin
bedtime
broke
the
circle
you
left
interesting
visitors
behind
and
sometimes
the
talk
was
better
as
the
night
wore
on
well
someone
ought
to
wood
up
down
yonder
will
you
go
was
in
the
act
of
declining
the
honour
but
benham
who
had
been
saying
it
takes
a
year
in
the
yukon
for
a
man
to
get
on
to
himself
interrupted
his
favourite
theme
to
ask
your
other
cabin
like
this
whereon
shameless
of
the
contrast
in
cabins
jumped
up
and
said
come
and
see
while
i
wood
up
you
very
well
fixed
here
said
benham
rising
and
looking
round
with
condescension
but
men
like
you
ought
to
try
to
live
without
real
bread
no
one
can
live
and
work
on
there
was
a
general
movement
to
the
door
of
which
benham
was
the
centre
i
tell
you
a
lump
of
sour
dough
kept
over
to
raise
the
next
batch
is
worth
more
in
this
country
than
a
pocket
full
of
gold
i
give
you
for
that
coat
said
mac
benham
turned
stared
back
at
him
a
moment
and
then
laughed
oh
well
i
suppose
i
can
get
another
made
for
rainey
before
the
first
boat
goes
down
then
is
it
on
account
o
the
bread
the
colonel
was
saying
that
the
calls
himself
a
all
on
account
o
the
bread
they
crowded
out
after
benham
coming
the
boy
who
was
last
held
the
door
open
mac
shook
his
head
it
was
one
of
the
bitter
nights
they
get
down
yonder
and
talk
by
the
fire
till
he
went
in
and
disturbed
them
that
was
all
he
had
wanted
for
mac
was
the
only
one
who
had
noticed
that
kaviak
had
waked
up
he
was
lying
as
still
as
a
mouse
alone
with
him
at
last
mac
kept
his
eyes
religiously
turned
away
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
watched
the
sparks
a
head
was
put
up
over
the
board
of
the
lower
bunk
mac
saw
it
but
sat
quite
still
farva
he
meant
to
answer
the
appeal
half
cleared
his
throat
but
his
voice
felt
rusty
it
would
turn
out
a
word
kaviak
climbed
timidly
shakily
out
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
in
his
bare
feet
farva
he
came
a
little
nearer
till
the
small
feet
sank
into
the
rough
brown
curls
of
the
buffalo
the
child
stooped
to
pick
up
his
wooden
cricket
wavered
and
was
about
to
fall
mac
shot
out
a
hand
steadied
him
an
instant
without
looking
and
then
set
the
cricket
in
front
of
the
fire
he
thereupon
averted
his
face
and
sat
as
before
with
folded
arms
he
had
deliberately
meant
to
make
kaviak
be
the
first
to
show
his
hand
after
all
that
had
happened
but
something
had
taken
hold
of
him
and
made
him
behave
as
he
had
dreamed
of
behaving
it
was
perhaps
a
fear
of
playing
the
fool
as
much
as
a
determination
to
see
how
much
ground
he
lost
with
the
youngster
the
child
was
observing
him
with
an
almost
feverish
intensity
with
eyes
fixed
upon
the
wooden
face
to
find
out
how
far
he
might
venture
shakily
he
dragged
the
cricket
from
where
mac
placed
it
closer
closer
and
as
no
terrible
change
in
the
unmoved
face
warned
him
to
desist
he
pulled
it
into
its
usual
evening
position
between
right
foot
and
the
fireplace
he
sank
down
with
a
sigh
of
relief
as
one
who
finishes
a
journey
long
and
perilous
the
fire
crackled
and
the
sparks
flew
gaily
kaviak
sat
there
in
the
red
glow
dressed
only
in
a
shirt
staring
with
incredulous
mournful
eyes
at
the
farva
who
had
then
as
mac
made
no
sign
he
sighed
again
and
held
out
two
little
shaky
hands
to
the
blaze
mac
gave
out
a
sound
between
a
cough
and
a
snort
and
wiped
his
eyes
on
the
back
of
his
hand
kaviak
had
started
nervously
you
cold
asked
mac
kaviak
nodded
hungry
he
nodded
again
and
fell
to
coughing
mac
got
up
and
brought
the
newly
purchased
coat
to
the
fire
it
for
you
he
said
as
the
child
big
eyes
grew
bigger
with
admiration
me
me
own
coat
he
stood
up
and
his
bare
feet
fluttered
up
and
down
feebly
but
with
huge
delight
as
the
parki
was
held
ready
the
child
tumbled
dizzily
into
it
and
mac
held
him
fast
an
instant
in
less
than
five
minutes
kaviak
was
once
more
seated
on
the
cricket
but
very
magnificent
now
in
his
coat
so
close
up
to
mac
that
he
could
lean
against
his
arm
and
eating
out
of
a
on
his
knees
a
discreet
spoonful
of
mush
drowned
in
golden
syrup
a
supper
for
a
sultan
if
only
there
had
been
more
when
he
had
finished
he
set
the
bowl
down
and
as
a
puppy
might
he
pushed
at
mac
arm
till
he
found
a
way
in
laid
his
head
down
on
farva
knee
with
a
contented
sigh
and
closed
his
heavy
eyes
mac
put
his
hand
on
the
cropped
head
and
began
about
that
empty
kaviak
started
up
shaking
from
head
to
foot
was
the
obscure
nightmare
coming
down
to
crush
him
again
mac
tried
to
soothe
him
but
kaviak
casting
about
for
charms
to
disarm
the
awful
fury
of
the
white
man
able
to
endure
with
dignity
any
reverse
save
that
of
having
his
syrup
spilt
cried

by

that
they
should
celebrate
christmas
not
so
much
by
a
feast
of

as
by
a

of
soul
and
a
dinner
to
be
followed
by
speeches
and
some
sort
of
cheerful
entertainment
we
goin
to
lay
ourselves
out
on
this
entertainment
said
the
boy
with
painful
misgivings
as
to
the
dinner
every
time
the
banquet
was
mentioned
somebody
was
sure
to
say
well
anyhow
there
potts
cake
and
that
reflection
never
failed
to
raise
the
tone
of
expectation
for
potts
cake
was
a
beauty
evidently
very
rich
and
fruity
and
fitted
by
nature
to
play
the
noble
part
of
but
in
making
out
the
bill
of
fare
facts
had
to
be
faced
we
got
our
everyday
little
rations
of
beans
and
bacon
and
we
got
potts
cake
and
we
got
one
skinny
ptarmigan
to
make
a
banquet
for
six
hungry
people
but
we
have
a
high
old
time
and
if
the
bill
o
fare
is
a
little
restricted
there
nothin
to
prevent
our
programme
of
toasts
songs
and
miscellaneous
contributions
from
bein
rich
and
varied
and
one
thing
we
can
get
even
up
here
the
colonel
was
looking
at
kaviak
and
that
a
little
said
potts
you
can
get
a
little
tree
but
you
ca
get
the
smallest
kind
of
a
little
thing
to
hang
on
it
sh
said
the
boy
it
must
be
a
surprise
and
he
took
steps
that
it
should
be
for
he
began
stealing
away
kaviak
few
cherished
possessions
his
amulet
his
top
from
under
the
bunk
his
boats
from
out
the
wherewith
to
mitigate
the
barrenness
of
the
yukon
tree
and
to
provide
a
pleasant
surprise
for
the
esquimer
who
mourned
his
playthings
as
gone
for
ever
of
an
evening
now
after
sleep
had
settled
on
kaviak
watchful
eyes
the
boy
worked
at
a
pair
of
little
helped
out
by
a
ball
of
sinew
he
had
got
from
nicholas
mac
bethought
him
of
the
valuable
combination
of
zoological
and
biblical
instruction
that
might
be
conveyed
by
means
of
a
noah
ark
he
sat
up
late
the
last
nights
before
the
whittling
chipping
pegging
in
legs
sharpening
beaks
and
inking
eyes
that
the
more
important
animals
might
be
ready
for
the
deluge
by
christmas
the
colonel
made
the
ark
and
took
up
a
collection
to
defray
the
expense
of
the
little
new
mucklucks
he
had
ordered
from
nicholas
they
were
to
come
by
christmas
eve
and
was
in
what
he
called
a
froightful
fanteeg
as
the
short
day
of
the
wore
towards
night
and
never
a
sign
of
the
pymeut
half
a
dozen
times
had
gone
beyond
the
stockade
to
find
out
if
he
was
in
sight
and
finally
came
back
looking
intensely
disgusted
bringing
a
couple
of
white
travellers
who
had
arrived
from
the
opposite
direction
very
cold
one
of
them
deaf
and
with
feet
and
both
so
tired
they
could
hardly
speak
of
course
they
were
made
as
comfortable
as
was
possible
the
frozen
one
rubbed
with
snow
and
bandaged
and
both
given
bacon
and
and
hot
tea
you
ought
to
let
yourself
get
into
a
state
like
this
said
mac
thinking
ruefully
of
these
strangers
obvious
inability
to
travel
for
a
day
or
two
and
of
the
christmas
dinner
to
which
benham
alone
had
been
bidden
by
a
great
stretch
of
hospitality
that
all
very
well
said
the
stranger
who
shouted
when
he
talked
at
all
but
how
a
man
to
know
his
feet
are
going
to
freeze
ye
see

misther
maccann

this
point
of
view
seemed
to
thaw
some
of
the
frost
out
of
the
two
wayfarers
they
confided
that
they
were
salmon
hardy
and
bill

in
the
locked
in
the
ice
down
below
and
they
mined
side
by

back
in
the
states
at
cripple
creek
yes
sir
and
sailed
for
the
klondyke
from
seattle
last
july
and
now
at
christmas
they
were
hoping
that
with
luck
they
might
reach
the
new
min√≥ok
diggings
seven
hundred
miles
this
side
of
the
klondyke
before
the
spring

during

recital

door
lorrd
love

a

screamed
and
the
mucklucks
passed
from
one
to
the
other
so
surreptitiously
that
for
all
kaviak
watchfulness
he
detected
nothing
nicholas
supped
with
his
white
friends
and
seemed
bent
on
passing
the
night
with
them
he
had
to
be
bribed
with
tobacco
and
a
new
to
go
home
and
keep
christmas
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
and
still
at
the
door
he
hesitated
drew
back
and
laid
the
silver
coin
on
the
table
no

but
it
is

pretty
soon

dark

then
what
the
matter
pymeut
no
like
dark
and
it
was
not
until
mac
put
on
his
own
and
offered
to
go
part
of
the
way
with
him
that
nicholas
was
at
last
induced
to
return
home
the
moment
kaviak
was
ascertained
to
be
asleep
displayed
the
mucklucks
no
mistake
they
were
dandies
the
boy
hung
one
of
them
up
by
its
long
leg
near
the
child
head
at
the
side
of
the
bunk
and
then
conferred
with
the
colonel
made
some
little
kind
o
things
for
the
tree
i
could
spare
you
one
or
two
divil
a

kaviak
take
it
kindly
but
furr
mesilf
i
thinkin
a
pitaty
a
dale
tastier
there
was
just
one
left
in
camp
it
had
rolled
behind
the
and
had
seized
on
it
with
rapture
where
everybody
was
in
such
need
of
vegetable
food
nobody
the
magnificence
of
offering
as
he
pushed
the
pitaty
down
into
the
toe
of
the
muckluck
sure
the
little
haythen
have
a
foine
christian
christmas
wid
that

coals
begorra
and
they
all
went
to
bed
save
mac
who
had
not
returned
and
the
boy
who
put
on
his
furs
and
went
up
the
hill
to
the
place
where
he
kept
the
lodged
in
a
he
shook
the
snow
off
its
branches
brought
it
down
to
the
cabin
decorated
it
and
carried
it
back
mac
salmon
hardy
and
the
schiff
were
waked
bright
and
early
christmas
morning
by
the
boy
screaming
with
laughter
the
colonel
looked
down
over
the
bunk
side
and
the
men
on
the
looked
up
and
they
all
saw
kaviak
sitting
in
bed
holding
in
one
hand
an
empty
muckluck
by
the
toe
and
in
the
other
a
raw
potato
keep
the
rest
of
it
to
roast
anyhow
or
heart
will
be
broken
so
they
deprived
kaviak
of
the
gnawed
fragment
and
consoled
him
by
helping
him
to
put
on
his
new
boots
when
the
little
cabin
contingent
came
in
to
breakfast
hello
what
you
got
up
on
the
roof
says
potts
foot
of
earth
and
three
feet
o
snow
but

bundle
echoes
the
boy
if
you
put
a
bundle
on
the
roof
i
you
know
what

it
says
the
colonel
severely
the
occupants
of
the
two
cabins
eyed
each
other
with
suspicion
thank

says
the
boy
but
we
not
takin
any
bundles
call
next
door
advised
the
colonel
you

to

but
just

out
and
see
for
yourself
no
sir
you
waked
the
wrong
passenger
they
tryin
it
on
said
potts
and
subsided
into
his
place
at
the
during
the
later
morning
while
the
colonel
wrestled
with
the
dinner
problem
the
boy
went
through
the
snow
to
see
if
the
tree
was
all
right
and
the
dogs
had
not
appropriated
the
presents
up
to
the
he
glanced
back
to
make
sure
kaviak
following
and
there
sure
enough
just
as
the
little
cabin
men
had
said
there
below
him
on
the
roof
was
a
bundle
packed
round
and
nearly
covered
over
with
snow
he
went
back
eyeing
it
suspiciously
whatever
it
was
it
seemed
to
be
done
up
in
sacking
for
a
bit
stuck
out
at
the
corner
where
the
wind
struck
keen
the
boy
walked
round
the
cabin
looking
listening
nobody
had
followed
him
or
nothing
would
have
induced
him
to
risk
the
derision
of
the
camp
as
it
was
he
would
climb
up
very
softly
and
lightly
and
nobody
but
himself
would
be
the
wiser
even
if
it
was
a
josh
he
brushed
away
the
snow
touching
the
thing
with
a
mittened
hand
and
a
creepy
feeling
at
his
spine
it
was
precious
heavy
and
hard
as
iron
he
tugged
at
the
sacking
jee
if
i
do
it
meat
the
lid
of
an
old
cardboard
box
was
bound
round
the
frozen
mass
with
a
string
and
on
the
cardboard
was
written
moose
and
christmas
greeting
from
kaviak
friends
at
holy
cross
to
kaviak
friends
by
the
big
chimney
come
out
you
fellas
hip
hip
hurrah
and
the
boy
danced
a
breakdown
on
the
roof
till
the
others
had
come
out
and
then
he
hurled
the
down
over
the
stockade
and
sent
the
placard
flying
after
they
all
gathered
round
mac
and
read
it
be
the
siven
well
i
swan
do
forget
boy
you
not
takin
any
just
remember
if
it
had
been
for
me
it
might
have
stayed
up
there
till
spring
you
run
in
kaviak
or
you
have
no
ears
but
that
gentleman
pulled
up
his
hood
and
stood
his
ground
how
did
it
get
on
the
roof
in
the
name
o
the
nation
asked
the
colonel
stamping
his
feet
never
hear
of
santa
claus
did
i
tell
you
kaviak
he
drove
his
reindeer
team
over
the
roofs
did
you
hear
any
dogs
go
by
in
the
night
i
did
nicholas
brought
it
i
and
was
told
to
cache
it
up
there
maybe
that
why
he
came
late
to
give
us
a
surprise
do
believe
it
we
have
heard
him
somebody
from
the
mission
came
by
in
the
night
and
did
want
to
wake
us
and
saw
there
were
dogs
it
froze
too
hard
to
cut
interrupted
salmon
hardy
who
had
been
trying
his
on
one
end
it
too
big
to
go
in
any
mortal
pot
and
it
take
a
month
to
thaw
they
tried
chopping
it
but
you
could
more
easily
chop
a
bolt
of
linen
sheeting
the
axe
laboriously
chewed
out
little
bits
and
scattered
shreds
stop
we
lose
a
lot
that
way
while
they
were
lamenting
this
fact
and
wondering
what
to
do
the
dogs
set
up
a
racket
and
were
answered
by
some
others
benham
was
coming
along
at
a
rattling
pace
his
dogs
very
angry
to
find
other
dogs
there
putting
on
airs
of
possession
we
got
all
this
says
potts
when
benham
arrived
on
the
scene
but
we
ca
cut
it
of
course
not
where
your
the
boy
brought
it
and
benham
triumphantly
sawed
off
two
fine
large
steaks
kaviak
scraped
up
the
meat
and
ate
it
with
grave
satisfaction
with
a
huge
steak
in
each
hand
the
colonel
beaming
led
the
procession
back
to
the
cabin
the
boy
and
mac
cached
the
rest
of
the
moose
on
the
roof
and
followed
fine
team
that
one
o
yours
said
salmon
hardy
to
the
trader

that
way
mean
to
skip
the
country
got
cold
feet
no
i
satisfied
enough
with
the
country
said
the
trader
quietly
and
acknowledged
the
introduction
to
schiff
sitting
in
bandages
by
the
fire
benham
turned
back
and
called
out
something
to
his
guide
i
thought
maybe
you
like
some
oysters
for
your
christmas
dinner
he
said
to
the
colonel
when
he
came
in
again
so
i
got
a
couple
o
cans
from
the
man
down
below
and
a
mighty
whoop
went
up
the
great
rapture
of
that
moment
did
not
however
prevent
saying
under
his
breath
did
ye
be
chanct
now

with
interest

benham

lorrd
now
look
at
that
drink
spirit
and
it
all
very
fine
and
reviving
for
a
few
minutes
but
a
man
ca
work
on
it

the
wan
thing

with
solemnity

the
wan

trail

the
colonel
no
i
do
go
without
but
i
keep
it
on
the
outside
of
me
unless
i
have
an
accident
salmon
studied
the
trader
with
curiosity
a
man
with
seven
magnificent
dogs
and
a
native
servant
and
the
finest
furs
he
ever
seen
here
was
either
a
capitalist
from
the
outside
or
a
man
who
had
struck
it
rich
on
the
inside
been
in
long
crossed
the
chilcoot
in
june
what
twelve
year
ago
benham
nodded
gosh
then
you
been
in
the
klondyke
not
since
the
gold
was
found
and
got
a
team
like
that
outside
and
not
even
goin
to
min√≥ok
guess
not
what
made
the
feller
so
damn
satisfied
only
one
explanation
was
possible
he
found
a
mine
without
going
even
as
far
as
min√≥ok
he
was
a
man
to
keep
your
eye
on
a
goodly
aroma
of
steaming
oysters
and
of
grilling
moose
arose
in
the
air
the
boy
set
up
the
amended
bill
of
fare
lit
the
christmas
candles
one
at
the
top
one
at
the
bottom
of
the
board
and
the
colonel
announced
the
first
course
though
it
was
one
and
they
usually
dined
at
four
the
soup
was
too
absorbingly
delicious
to
admit
of
conversation
the
had
vanished
like
the
in
the
thaw
before
anything
much
was
said
save
nothin
th
matter
with
moose
hey
nop
bet
your
life
the
salmi
of
ptarmigan
appeared
as
a
great
wash
of
gravy
in
which
portions
of
the
much
bird
swam
in
vain
for
their
lives
but
the
high
flat
rim
of
the
dish
was
plentifully
garnished
by
fingers
of
and
the
gravy
was
galoppshus
so
potts
said
salmon
having
appeased
the
pangs
of
hunger
returned
to
his
perplexed
study
of
benham
did
i
understand
you
to
say
you
came
into
this
country
to
came
down
the
and
prospected
a
whole
summer
at
forty
mile
what
river
did
you
come
by
same
as
you
go
by
the
yukon
indians
up
yonder
call
it
the
and
the
more
you
find
out
about
it
the
better
you
think
the
name
did
you
do
any
good
at
forty
mile
not
enough
to
turn
my
head
so
i
tried
the
koyukuk
and
other
diggins
too
hear
that
schiff
he
roared
at
his
bandaged
friend
never
say
die
this
been
at
it
twelve
years
tried
more
one
camp
but
now
well
he
so
well
fixed
he
do
care
a
cuss
about
the
klondyke
schiff
lit
up
and
pulled
hard
at
the
cutty
had
taken
kaviak
to
the
fire
and
was
showing
him
how
to
roast
half
a
petaty
in
wood
ashes
but
he
was
listening
to
the
story
and
putting
in
be
the
siven
at
appropriate
moments
schiff
poured
out
a
cloud
of
rank
smoke
he
said
the
best
klondyke
claims
be
potted
the
camp
o
the
future
you
better
come
along
with
us
got
no
dogs
sighed
the
boy
but
the
two
strangers
looked
hard
at
the
man
who
had
that
excuse
benham
sat
and
idly
watched
preparations
for
the
next
course
say
a
nabob
like
you
might
give
us
a
tip
how
did
you
do
the
trick
well
i
been
playing
your
game
for
three
years
and
no
galley
slave
ever
worked
half
as
hard
that
it
work
like
the
devil
for
a
couple
o
years
and
then
live
like
a
lord
for
ever
after
yes
well
when
the
time
came
for
me
to
go
into
the
lord
business
i
had
just
dollars
and
sixty
cents
to
set
up
on
what
had
you
done
with
the
rest
i
spent
the
five
thousand
dollars
my
father
left
me
and
i
cleaned
up
just
dollars
sixty
cents
in
my
three
years
mining
the
announcement
fell
chill
on
the
company
i
was
dead
broke
and
i
had
no
credit
i
went
home
but
mac
roused
himself
you
did
stay
no
you
do
stay
as
a
rule
mac
remembered
caribou
get
used
to
this
kind
o
thing
and
miss
it
miss
it
so
you
you
came
back
says
salmon
impatient
of
generalities
and
won
this
time
whispered
schiff
for
that
is
how
every
story
must
end
the
popular
taste
in
fiction
is
universal
a
friend
at
home
me
and
i
came
in
again
came
down
on
the
high
water
in
june
prospected
as
long
as
my
stuff
lasted
and
then
well
i
did
care
about
starving
i
became
an
c
trader
a
long
pause
this
was
no
climax
everybody
waited
and
now
i
on
my
own
i
often
make
more
money
in
a
day
trading
with
the
indians
in
furs
fish
and
than
i
made
in
my
whole
experience
as
a
prospector
and
miner
a
frost
had
fallen
on
the
genial
company
but
even
if
had
any
luck
the
boy
suggested
you
must
have
seen
others
oh
i
saw
some
washing
gravel
that
kept
body
and
soul
together
and
i
saw
some
that
did
in
the
pause
he
added
remorseless
i
helped
to
bury
some
of
them
your
experience
was
unusual
or
why
do
men
come
back
year
after
year
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
thing
called
hope
they
moved
uneasily
on
their
stools
and
some
rubbed
stubbly
chins
with
perplexed
uncertain
fingers
and
they
all
glowered
at
the
speaker
he
was
uncomfortable
this
fellow
well
there
may
be
as
much
gold
up
here
as
men
think
but
more
hope
than
anywhere
on
earth
to
hell
with
hope
give
me
certainty
says
salmon
exactly
so
you
shuffle
the
cards
and
laugh
down
the
limit
you
play
one
last
big
game
and
it
be
for
life
this
time
as
well
as
fortune
cheerful
cuss
ai
he
whispered
schiff
they
say
we
a
nation
of
gamblers
well
sir
the
biggest
game
we
play
is
the
game
that
goes
on
near
the
arctic
circle
what
the
matter
with
wall
street
is
such
a
pretty
game
and
they
do
play
for
their
lives
i
tell
you
it
love
of
gambling
brings
men
here
and
it
the
splendid
stiff
game
they
find
going
on
that
keeps
them
there
nothing
like
it
on
earth
his
belated
enthusiasm
deceived
nobody
it
do
seem
to
have
excited
you
much
said
mac
oh
i
had
my
turn
at
it
and
just
by
luck
i
found
i
could
play
another
a
safer
game
and
not
bad
fun
either
he
sat
up
straight
and
shot
his
hands
down
deep
in
the
pockets
of
his
mackinaws
i
got
a
good
thing
and
i
willing
to
stay
with
it
the
company
looked
at
him
coldly
well
drawled
potts
you
can
look
after
the
fur
trade
give
me
a
modest
little
claim
in
the
klondyke
oh
klondyke
klondyke
benham
got
up
and
stepped
over
kaviak
on
his
way
to
the
fire
he
lit
a
short
briarwood
with
a
flaming
stick
and
turned
about
shall
i
tell
you
fellows
a
little
secret
about
the
klondyke
he
held
up
the
burning
brand
in
the
dim
room
with
telling
emphasis
the
smoke
and
flame
blew
black
and
orange
across
his
face
as
he
said
dollar
that
taken
out
of
the
klondyke
in
will
cost
three
dollars
in
a
sense
of
distinct
dislike
to
benham
had
spread
through
the
company
a
fellow
who
called
american
enterprise
love
of
gambling
for
whom
heroism
was
foolhardy
and
hope
insane
where
was
a
pioneer
so
bold
he
could
get
up
now
and
toast
the
klondyke
who
now
without
grim
misgiving
could
forecast
a
rosy
future
for
each
man
at
the
board
and
that
in
brief
had
been
the
programme
oh
help
the
puddin
colonel
said
the
boy
like
one
who
starts
up
from
an
evil
dream
but
they
sat
chilled
and
moody
eating
as
if
it
had
been
so
much
beans
and
bacon
mac
felt
robert
bruce
expensive
education
slipping
out
of
reach
potts
saw
his
girl
tired
of
waiting
taking
up
with
another
fellow
the
boy
orange
grove
was
farther
off
than
florida
schiff
and
hardy
wondered
for
a
moment
who
was
the
gainer
for
all
their
killing
hardship
not
they
at
present
although
there
was
the
prospect
the
hope
oh
damn
the
trader
the
colonel
made
the
punch
drained
his
cup
without
waiting
for
the
mockery
of
that
first
toast
our
although
no
one
had
taken
more
interest
in
the
programme
than
benham
talked
about
the
anvik
and
the
money
made
in
wood
camps
along
the
river
nobody
listened
though
everyone
else
sat
silent
smoking
and
sulkily
drinking
his
punch
kaviak
demand
for
some
of
the
beverage
reminded
the
boy
of
the
it
had
been
intended
as
a
climax
to
wind
up
the
entertainment
but
to
produce
it
now
might
save
the
situation
he
got
up
and
pulled
on
his
parki
back
a
minute
but
he
was
gone
a
long
time
benham
looked
down
the
and
smiled
inwardly
for
it
was
klondyked
from
top
to
bottom
the
others
too
stole
uneasy
glances
at
that
programme
staring
them
in
the
face
unabashed
covertly
ironic
nay
openly
jeering
they
actually
had
noticed
the
fact
before
but
every
blessed
speech
was
aimed
straight
at
the
wonderful
gold
camp
across
the
line
not
the
klondyke
of
benham
croaking
but
the
klondyke
of
their
dreams
even
the
death
head
at
the
feast
regretted
the
long
postponement
of
so
spirited
a
programme
interspersed
as
it
promised
to
be
with
songs
dances
and
tricks
and
winding
up
with
an
original
poem
he
wo
be
happy
till
he
gets
it
benham
indian
had
got
up
and
gone
out
kaviak
had
tried
to
go
too
but
the
door
was
slammed
in
his
face
he
stood
there
with
his
nose
to
the
crack
exactly
as
a
dog
does
suddenly
he
ran
back
to
mac
and
tugged
at
his
arm
even
the
dull
white
men
could
hear
an
ominous
snarling
among
the
mahlemeuts
out
of
the
distance
a
faint
answering
howl
of
derision
from
some
enemy
advancing
or
at
bay
it
was
often
like
this
when
two
teams
put
up
at
the
big
chimney
camp
reckon
our
dogs
are
gettin
into
trouble
said
salmon
anxiously
to
his
deaf
and
crippled
partner
it
nothing
says
the
trader
a
siwash
dog
of
any
spirit
is
always
trailing
his
coat
and
salmon
subsided
not
so
kaviak
back
to
the
door
head
up
he
listened
they
had
observed
the
oddity
before
the
melancholy
note
of
the
mahlemeut
never
yet
had
failed
to
stir
his
sombre
little
soul
he
was
standing
now
looking
up
at
the
latch
high
and
made
for
white
men
eager
breathing
fast
listening
to
that
dismal
sound
that
is
like
nothing
else
in
nature
listening
as
might
an
exiled
scot
to
the
skirl
of
bagpipes
listening
as
a
tyrolese
who
hears
yodelling
on
foreign
hills
or
as
the
dweller
in
a
distant
land
to
the
sound
of
the
dear
home
speech
the
noise
outside
grew
louder
the
air
was
rent
with
howls
of
rage
and
defiance
sounds
as
if
there
a
million
mad
dogs
on
your
front
stoop
says
schiff
knowing
there
must
be
a
great
deal
going
on
if
any
of
it
reached
his
ears
you
set
still
his
pardner
pushed
him
down
on
his
stool
benham
and
i
see
what
up
the
trader
leisurely
opened
the
door
salmon
keeping
modestly
behind
while
kaviak
darted
forward
only
to
be
caught
back
by
mac
an
avalanche
of
sound
swept
in
a
mighty
howling
and
snarling
and
cracking
of
whips
and
underneath
the
higher
clamour
human
voices
and
in
dashes
the
boy
powdered
with
snow
laughing
and
balancing
carefully
in
his
mittened
hands
a
little
yukon
spruce
every
needle
every
sturdy
branch
white
with
frost
crystals
and
soft
woolly
snow
and
bearing
its
little
harvest
of
curious
fruit
rings
and
stars
and
two
gingerbread
men
hanging
by
from
the
white
and
green
branches
the
noah
ark
lodged
in
one
crotch
the
very
amateur
in
another
and
the
lost
toys
wrapped
up
transfigured
in
dangling
merrily
before
kaviak
incredulous
eyes
there
your
and
the
bringer
who
had
carried
the
tree
so
that
no
little
puff
of
snow
or
delicate
crystal
should
fall
off
having
made
a
successful
entrance
and
dazzled
the
child
gave
way
to
the
strong
excitement
that
shot
light
out
of
his
eyes
and
brought
scarlet
into
his
cheeks
here
take
it
he
dashed
the
tree
down
in
front
of
kaviak
and
a
sudden
storm
agitated
its
sturdy
branches
it
snowed
about
the
floor
and
the
strange
fruit
whirled
and
spun
in
the
blast
kaviak
clutched
it
far
too
dazed
to
do
more
than
stare
the
boy
stamped
the
snow
off
his
mucklucks
on
the
threshold
and
dashed
his
cap
against
the
lintel
calling
out
come
in
come
in
let
the
dogs
fight
it
out
behind
him
between
the
at
the
entrance
had
appeared
two
faces
men
crowding
in
the
narrow
space
craning
to
see
the
reception
of
the
and
the
inside
of
the
famous
big
chimney
cabin
these
gentlemen
says
the
boy
shaking
with
excitement
as
he
ushered
them
in
are
john
dillon
and
general
lighter
they
just
done
the
six
hundred
and
miles
from
min√≥ok
with
dogs
over
the
ice
they
been
forty
days
on
the
trail
and
they
as
fit
as
fiddles
an
no
yonder
for
little
min√≥ok
has
made
big
millionaires
both
o
them
millionaires
or
not
they
never
either
of
them
create
a
greater
sensation
than
they
did
that
christmas
day
in
the
big
chimney
cabin
on
the
bleak
hillside
up
above
the
here
was
certainty
at
last
here
was
justification
precious
symbols
of
success
they
were
taken
by
both
hands
they
were
shaken
and
wildly
welcomed
peeled
set
down
by
the
fire
given
punch
asked
ten
thousand
questions
all
in
a
breath
rejoiced
over
and
looked
up
to
as
glorious
dispellers
of
doubt
blessed
saviours
from
despair
schiff
had
tottered
forward
on
bandaged
feet
hand
round
ear
mouth
open
as
if
to
swallow
whole
whatever
he
could
hear
the
colonel
kept
on
bowing
magnificently
at
intervals
and
pressing
refreshment
slapping
his
thigh
and
reiterating
be
the
siven
potts
not
only
widened
his
mouth
from
ear
to
ear
but
as
said
after
stretched
it
clane
round
his
head
and
tyed
it
up
furr
jy
in
a
nate
knot
behind
benham
took
a
back
seat
and
when
anybody
remembered
him
for
the
next
hour
it
was
openly
to
gloat
over
his
discomfiture
john
dillon
was
one
of
those
frontiersmen
rightly
called
typically
american
you
see
him
again
and
again
as
a
cowboy
in
texas
as
a
miner
or
herdsman
all
through
the
far
west
you
see
him
cutting
lumber
along
the
columbia
or
throwing
the
diamond
hitch
as
he
goes
from
camp
to
camp
for
gold
and
freedom
he
takes
risks
cheerfully
and
he
never
works
for
wages
when
he
can
go
on
his
own
john
dillon
was
like
the
majority
tall
lean
muscular
not
an
ounce
of
superfluous
flesh
on
his
bones
a
face
almost
gaunt
in
its
clearness
of
cut
a
thin
straight
nose
chin
not
heavy
but
well
curved
out
the
eye
orbit
arched
and
deep
a
frown
fixed
between
thick
eyebrows
and
few
words
in
his
firm
rather
mouth
he
was
perhaps
had
been
in
ten
years
and
had
mined
before
that
in
idaho
under
his
striped
parki
he
was
dressed
in
spotted
wore
white
mucklucks
arctic
cap
and
moose
mittens
pinned
on
his
inner
shirt
was
the
badge
of
the
yukon
order
of
pioneers
a
footrule
bent
like
the
letter
a
above
a
scroll
of
leaves
and
in
the
angle
two
linked
o
over
it
was
the
other
man
the
western
towns
are
full
of
general
lighters
who
did
the
talking
an
attorney
from
seattle
he
had
come
up
in
the
july
rush
with
very
little
but
boundless
assurance
fell
in
with
an
old
miner
who
had
been
grubstaked
by
captain
rainey
out
of
the
supplies
and
got
to
min√≥ok
before
the
river
went
to
sleep
no
we
not
pardners
exactly
he
said
glancing
at
dillon
we
worked
separate
but
we
going
home
two
by
two
like
animals
into
the
ark
we
got
this
in
common
we
both
ile
have
we
dillon
dillon
nodded
little
min√≥ok
as
rich
a
camp
as
dawson
and
the
gold
of
higher
grade
is
it
dillon
that
right
one
of
the
many
great
advantages
of
min√≥ok
is
that
it
the
place
on
the
river
where
they
struck
pay
dirt
says
the
general
and
another
great
advantage
is
that
it
on
the
american
side
of
the
line
what
advantage
is
that
mac
grated
out
just
the
advantage
of
not
having
all
your
hard
earnings
taken
away
by
an
iniquitous
tax
look
out
this
fella
a
britisher
do
care
if
he
is
and
no
disrespect
to
you
sir
the
canadians
in
the
klondyke
are
the
first
to
say
the
tax
is
nothing
short
of
highway
robbery
you
see
the
minute
they
hear
of
gold
across
the
line
there
be
a
stampede
out
of
dawson
i
can
put
you
in
the
way
of
getting
a
claim
for
eight
thousand
dollars
that
you
can
take
eighty
thousand
out
of
next
august
with
no
inspector
coming
round
to
check
your
and
no
government
grabbing
at
your
royalties
why
are
you
taking
out
that
eighty
thousand
yourself
asked
mac
bluntly
got
more
one
man
can
handle
answered
the
general
reckon
earned
a
holiday
dillon
backed
him
up
then
it
is
shortage
in
provisions
that
takes
you
outside
said
the
boy
not
much
plenty
of
food
at
rampart
city
that
the
name
o
the
town
where
the
little
min√≥ok
meets
the
yukon
food
at
prices
i
suppose
no
just
about
the
same
they
quote
you
in
seattle
how
is
that
possible
when
it
been
carried
four
thousand
miles
because
the
and
and
boats
got
frozen
in
this
side
of
dawson
they
know
by
the
time
they
get
there
in
june
a
lot
of
stuff
will
have
come
in
by
the
short
route
through
the
lakes
and
the
town
will
be
overstocked
so
there
flour
and
bacon
to
burn
when
you
get
up
as
far
as
min√≥ok
it
only
along
the
lower
river
there
any
real
scarcity
the
big
chimney
men
exchanged
significant
looks
and
there
are
more
wintering
up
at
fort
yukon
and
at
circle
city
the
general
went
on
i
tell
you
on
the
upper
river
there
food
to
burn
again
the
big
chimney
men
looked
at
one
another
the
general
kept
helping
himself
to
punch
and
as
he
tossed
it
off
he
would
say
min√≥ok
the
camp
for
me
when
he
had
given
vent
to
this
conviction
three
times
benham
who
had
spoken
since
their
entrance
said
quietly
and
you
going
away
from
it
as
hard
as
you
can
pelt
the
general
turned
moist
eyes
upon
him
are
you
a
man
of
family
sir
no
then
i
can
not
expect
you
to
understand
his
eyes
brimmed
at
some
thought
too
fine
and
moving
for
public
utterance
each
member
of
the
camp
sat
deeply
cogitating
not
only
gold
at
min√≥ok
but
food
in
the
inner
vision
of
every
eye
was
a
of
provisions
frozen
in
hard
by
a
placer
claim
in
every
heart
a
fervid
prayer
for
a
the
boy
jumped
up
and
ran
his
fingers
through
his
long
wild
hair
he
panted
softly
like
a
hound
straining
at
a
leash
then
with
an
obvious
effort
to
throw
off
the
magic
of
min√≥ok
he
turned
suddenly
about
and
poor
old
kaviak
says
he
looking
round
and
speaking
in
quite
an
everyday
sort
of
voice
the
child
was
leaning
against
the
door
clasping
the
forgotten
so
tight
against
the
coat
that
the
branches
hid
his
face
from
time
to
time
with
reverent
finger
he
touched
silver
boat
and
top
and
watched
fascinated
how
they
swung
a
white
child
in
a
tenth
of
the
time
would
have
eaten
the
cakes
torn
off
the
transfiguring
tinfoil
tired
of
the
tree
and
forgotten
it
the
boy
felt
some
compunction
at
the
sight
of
kaviak
steadfast
fidelity
look
here
we
set
the
tree
up
where
you
can
see
it
better
he
put
an
empty
bucket
on
the
table
and
with
mac
help
wedged
the
spruce
in
it
firmly
between
some
blocks
of
wood
and
books
of
the
law
the
cabin
was
very
crowded
little
schiff
was
sitting
on
the
cricket
kaviak
retired
to
his
old
seat
on
elephas
beyond
the
bunks
where
he
still
had
a
good
view
of
the
wonderful
tree
agreeably
lit
by
what
was
left
of
the
two
candles
those
things
are
good
to
eat
you
know
said
the
colonel
kindly
mac
cut
down
a
gingerbread
man
and
gave
it
into
the
tiny
hands
what
wind
blew
that
thing
into
your
cabin
asked
the
general
squinting
up
his
eyes
at
the
dim
corner
where
kaviak
sat
there
was
a
man
in
the
camp
who
did
resent
the
tone
this
is
a
great
friend
of
ours
ai
you
kaviak
said
the
boy
he
got
a
soul
above
have
you
he
sees
other
fellas
helping
themselves
to
his
cricket
and
his
high
chair
too
polite
to
object
just
goes
and
sits
like
a
philosopher
on
the
bones
of
dead
devils
and
looks
on
other
fellas
sittin
in
his
place
talkin
about
gold
and
drinkin
punch
never
offerin
him
a
drop
several
cups
were
held
out
but
mac
motioned
them
back
i
do
think
says
john
dillon
slyly
do
think
punch
will
hurt
the
gentleman
and
a
roar
went
up
at
the
colonel
expense
general
lighter
pulled
himself
to
his
feet
saying
there
was
a
little
good
old
rye
left
outside
and
he
could
stock
up
again
when
he
got
to
the
oh
and
it
yersilf
that
do
shoy
off
from
a
dthrop
o
the
craythur
whin

thrail
everybody
looked
at
benham
he
got
up
and
began
to
put
on
his
furs
his
squatting
by
the
door
took
the
hint
and
went
out
to
see
after
the
team
oh

said
the
general
to
it
christmas

know
and
he
picked
his
way
among
the
company
to
the
door

to
be
movin

said
dillon
straightening
up
the
general
halted
depressed
at
the
reminder
you

we
swore
we
would
stop
again
unless
look
here
did
you

early
yesterday
to
tell
about
the
glad
news
tiding
diggin
i
mean

they
say

as
good
an
audience
as
the
general
used
to
that
why
we
pushed
on
we
heard
about
your
camp
and
the
general
felt
a
call
to
preach
the
gospel
accordin
to
min√≥ok
down
this
way
he
do
seem
to
be
standin
the
racket
as
well
as
you
said
schiff
well
sir
this
is
the
first
time
i
found
him
wantin
to
hang
round
after
he
thoroughly
rubbed
in
the
news
dillon
moved
away
from
the
fire
the
crowded
cabin
was
getting
hot
nevertheless
the
colonel
put
on
more
wood
explaining
to
salmon
and
the
others
who
also
moved
back
that
it
was
for
illuminating
purposes
those
two
candles
burning
down
low
each
between
three
nails
in
a
little
slab
of
wood
those
two
had
been
kept
for
christmas
and
were
the
last
they
had
in
the
general
movement
from
the
fire
benham
putting
on
his
cap
and
gloves
had
got
next
to
dillon

said
the
trader
under
cover
of
the
talk
about
candles
what
sort
of
a
trip
have
you
had
the
yukon
pioneer
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
then
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
to
say
rank
no
fun
hey
that
right
he
restored
the
pipe
and
drew
gently
and
yet
to
hear
the
general
chirp
he
got
plenty
o
grit
the
general
has
has
he
got
gold
dillon
nodded
or

a
sort
of
a
kind
of
a
way

benham
wagged
his
head
he
talkin
for
a
market
dillon
smoked
goin
out
to
stir
up
a
boom
and
sell
his
claim
to
some
sucker
the
general
reappeared
with
the
whisky
stamping
the
snow
off
his
feet
before
he
joined
the
group
at
the
table
where
the
was
seasonably
cheek
by
jowl
with
the
between
the
candles
mixing
the
new
brew
did
not
interrupt
the
general
ecstatic
references
to
min√≥ok
look
here
he
shouted
across
to
mac
i
give
you
a
lay
on
my
best
claim
for
two
thousand
down
and
a
small
royalty

said
the
general
promptly
oh

ejaculated
benham
and
hurriedly
he
made
his
what
the
matter
with
demanded
the
general
with
dignity
i
only
surprised
to
hear
min√≥ok
hundred
miles
away
more
like
six
hundred
says
the
colonel
and
you
been
forty
days
coming
and

cover
sixty
miles
a
day
he
laughed
and
was
gone
well
a
the
general
looked
round
travelin
depends
on
the
weather
dillon
helped
him
out
exactly
depends
on
the
weather
echoed
the
general
you
do
get
an
old
like
dillon
to
travel
at
forty
degrees
how
are
you
to
know
whispered
schiff
tie
a
little
bottle
o
quick
to
your
sled
answered
dillon
bottle
o
what
asked
the
boy
quicksilver
mercury
interpreted
the
general
no
who
knows
what
he
about
travels
when
his
quick
goes
dead
if
the
stuff
like
lead
in
your
bottle
the
general
stopped
to
sample
the
new
brew
in
the
pause
from
the
far
side
of
the
cabin
dillon
spat
straight
and
clean
into
the
heart
of
the
coals
well
what
do
you
do
when
the
mercury
freezes
asked
the
boy
camp
said
dillon
impassively
resuming
his
pipe
i
suppose
the
boy
went
on
wistfully
i
suppose
you
met
men
all
the
way
making
straight
for
min√≥ok
only
on
this
last
lap
they
do
get
far
most
of
but
but
it
worth
trying
the
boy
hurried
to
bridge
the
chasm
the
general
lifted
his
right
arm
in
the
attitude
of
the
orator
about
to
make
a
telling
hit
but
he
was
hampered
by
having
a
mug
at
his
lips
in
the
pause
as
he
stood
commanding
attention
at
the
same
time
that
he
swallowed
half
a
pint
of
liquor
he
gave
dillon
time
leisurely
to
get
up
knock
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
stick
it
in
his
belt
put
a
slow
hand
behind
him
towards
his
pistol
pocket
and
bring
out
his
buckskin
gold
sack
now
only
mac
of
the
other
men
had
ever
seen
a
miner
purse
before
but
every
one
of
the
four
cheechalkos
knew
instinctively
what
it
was
that
dillon
held
so
carelessly
in
that
long
narrow
bag
like
the
leg
of
a
child
stocking
was
the
stuff
they
had
all
come
seeking
the
general
smacked
his
lips
and
set
down
the
granite
cup
the
argument
he
said
got
a
noospaper
the
colonel
looked
about
in
a
flustered
way
for
the
tattered
san
francisco
potts
and
the
boy
hustled
the
on
to
the
bucket
board
recklessly
spilling
some
of
the
precious
contents
and
salmon
whisked
the
christmas
tree
into
the
corner
and
not
even
the
boy
remonstrated
when
a
gingerbread
man
broke
his
neck
and
was
trampled
under
foot
quick
the
candles
are
going
out
shouted
the
boy
and
in
truth
each
wick
lay
languishing
in
a
little
island
of
grease
now
flaring
bravely
now
flickering
to
dusk
it
took
some
time
to
find
in
the
san
francisco
of
august
a
foot
square
space
that
was
whole
but
as
quickly
as
possible
the
best
bit
was
spread
in
the
middle
of
the
table
dillon
in
the
breathless
silence
having
slowly
untied
the
thongs
held
his
sack
aslant
between
the
two
lights
and
poured
out
a
and
coarse
bright
gold
the
crowd
about
the
table
drew
audible
breath
nobody
actually
spoke
at
first
except
who
said
reverently
be
the
siven
howly
pipers
that
danced
at
me
weddin
when
the
divvle
called
the
chune
even
the
swimming
wicks
flared
up
and
seemed
to
reach
out
each
a
hungry
tongue
of
flame
to
touch
and
taste
the
glittering
heap
before
they
went
into
the
dark
low
exclamations
hands
thrust
out
to
feel
and
drawn
back
in
a
sort
of
superstitious
awe
here
it
was
this
wonderful
stuff
they
come
for
each
one
knew
by
the
wild
excitement
in
his
own
breast
how
in
secret
he
had
been
brought
to
doubt
its
being
here
but
here
it
was
lying
in
a
heap
on
the
big
cabin
table
and
now
it
was
gone
the
right
candle
had
given
out
and
blowing
with
impatience
like
a
walrus
had
simultaneously
extinguished
the
other
for
an
instant
a
group
of
men
with
strained
and
dazzled
eyes
still
bent
above
the
blackness
on
the
boards
stir
the
fire
called
the
colonel
and
flew
to
do
it
himself
i
light
a
piece
of
fat
pine
shouted
the
boy
catching
up
a
stick
and
thrusting
it
into
the
coals
where
your
bitch
said
dillon
calmly
bitch
have
you
got
a
condensed
milk
can
with
some
bacon
grease
in
it
and
a
rag
wick
makes
a
good
enough
light
but
the
fire
had
been
poked
up
and
the
cabin
was
full
of
dancing
lights
and
shadows
besides
that
the
boy
was
holding
a
resinous
stick
alight
over
the
table
and
they
all
bent
down
as
before
it
was
passin
a
bank
in
wid
a
windy
full
o
that
stuff
that
brought
me
up
here
said
it
was
hearin
about
that
winder
brought
added
potts
everyone
longed
to
touch
and
feel
about
in
the
glittering
pile
but
no
one
as
yet
had
dared
to
lay
a
finger
on
the
smallest
grain
in
the
hoard
an
electrical
shock
flashed
through
the
company
when
the
general
picked
up
one
of
the
biggest
nuggets
and
threw
it
down
with
a
rich
thud
that
one
is
four
ounces
he
took
up
another
this
is
worth
about
sixty
dollars
more
like
forty
said
dillon
they
were
of
every
conceivable
shape
and
shapelessness
most
of
them
flattened
some
of
them
the
greenhorn
would
swear
were
fashioned
by
man
into
roughly
embossed
hearts
or
shells
or
polished
discs
like
rude
defaced
coins
one
was
a
perfect
staple
another
the
letter
l
another
like
an
and
one
like
a
peasant
sabot
some
were
almost
black
with
iron
stains
and
some
were
set
with
jewels
of
quartz
but
for
the
most
part
they
were
formless
fragments
of
a
rich
and
brassy
yellow
lots
of
the
little
fellas
are
like
and
the
boy
pointed
a
shaking
finger
longing
and
still
not
daring
to
touch
the
treasure
each
man
had
a
dim
feeling
in
the
back
of
his
head
that
after
all
the
hillock
of
gold
was
an
illusion
and
his
own
hand
upon
the
dazzling
pile
would
clutch
the
empty
air
where
your
dust
asked
the
boy
dillon
stared
why
here
this
is
all
nuggets
and
grains
well
what
more
do
you
want
oh
it
do
well
enough
for
me
but
it
ai
dust
it
what
we
call
dust
as
coarse
as
this
the
nodded
and
lighter
laughed
there
a
fox
mask
said
the
colonel
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
pointing
a
triangular
bit
out
let
me
look
at
it
a
minute
begged
the
boy
hand
it
round
whispered
schiff
it
was
real
it
was
gold
their
fingers
tingled
under
the
first
contact
this
was
the
beginning
the
rude
bit
of
metal
bred
a
glorious
confidence
under
the
magic
of
its
touch
robert
bruce
expensive
education
became
a
simple
certainty
in
potts
hand
the
nugget
gave
birth
to
a
mighty
progeny
he
saw
himself
pouring
out
sackfuls
before
his
enraptured
girl
the
boy
lifted
his
flaring
torch
with
a
victorious
sense
of
having
just
bought
back
the
orange
grove
and
salmon
passed
the
nugget
to
his
partner
with
a
blissful
sigh
well
i
glad
we
did
get
cold
feet
says
he
yes
whispered
schiff
it
looks
like
we
goin
to
the
right
place
the
sheen
of
the
heap
of
yellow
treasure
was
trying
even
to
the
nerves
of
the
colonel
put
it
away
he
said
quite
solemnly
laying
the
nugget
on
the
paper
put
it
all
away
before
the
firelight
dies
down
dillon
leisurely
gathered
it
up
and
dropped
the
nuggets
with
an
air
into
the
pouch
which
lighter
held
but
the
san
francisco
had
been
worn
to
the
softness
of
an
old
rag
and
the
thinness
of
tissue
under
dillon
sinewy
fingers
pinching
up
the
gold
the
paper
gave
way
oh
exclaimed
more
than
one
voice
as
at
some
grave
mishap
dillon
improvised
a
scoop
out
of
a
dirty
envelope
nobody
spoke
and
everybody
watched
and
when
finally
with
his
hand
he
brushed
the
remaining
grains
off
the
torn
paper
into
the
envelope
poured
them
into
the
gaping
and
lazily
pulled
at
the
buckskin
everybody
sat
wondering
how
much
if
any
of
the
precious
metal
had
escaped
through
the
tear
and
how
soon
dillon
would
come
out
of
his
brown
study
remember
and
recover
the
loss
but
a
spell
seemed
to
have
fallen
on
the
company
no
one
spoke
till
dillon
with
that
lazy
motion
hoisting
one
square
shoulder
and
half
turning
his
body
round
was
in
the
act
of
returning
the
sack
to
his
wait
said
mac
with
the
explosiveness
of
a
firearm
and
jumped
you
ai
got
it
all
whispered
schiff
hurriedly
oh
i
leavin
the
for
luck
dillon
nodded
at
the
colonel
but
schiff
pointed
reverently
at
the
tear
in
the
paper
as
dillon
only
went
on
pushing
his
sack
deep
down
in
his
pocket
while
mac
lifted
the
all
but
the
two
millionaires
bent
forward
and
scrutinised
the
table
impulsively
ran
one
lone
hand
over
the
place
where
the
had
lain
his
other
hand
held
ready
at
the
table
edge
to
catch
any
sweepings
none
but
the
result
of
action
was
that
those
particles
of
gold
that
that
fallen
through
the
paper
were
driven
into
the
cracks
and
inequalities
of
the
board
there
see
now
look
what
you
done
mac
pointed
out
a
rough
too
that
slyly
held
back
a
pinch
of
gold
oh
that
dillon
slapped
his
hip
and
settled
into
his
place
but
the
men
nearest
the
crack
and
the
fell
to
digging
out
the
renegade
grains
and
piously
offering
them
to
their
lawful
owner
that
ai
worth
botherin
about
laughed
dillon
you
always
reckon
to
lose
a
little
each
time
even
if
you
got
a
china
plenty
more
where
that
came
from
said
the
general
easily
such
indifference
was
felt
to
be
magnificent
indeed
the
little
incident
said
more
for
the
richness
of
min√≥ok
than
all
the
blowing
they
forgot
that
what
was
lost
would
amount
to
less
than
fifty
cents
the
fact
that
it
was
gold
min√≥ok
gold
gave
it
a
symbolic
value
not
to
be
computed
in
coin
how
do
you
go
asked
the
colonel
as
the
two
millionaires
began
putting
on
their
things

dillon
went
out
and
roused
up
the
dogs
asleep
in
the
snow
with
their
bushy
tails
sheltering
their
sharp
noses
see
you
later
yes
outside
no

dillon
swore
a
string
of
curses
and
cracked
his
whip
over
the
leader
why
you
comin
back
bet
your
life
and
nobody
who
looked
at
the
face
of
the
yukon
pioneer
could
doubt
he
meant
what
he
said
they
went
indoors
the
cabin
wore
an
unwonted
and
a
rakish
air
the
stools
seemed
to
have
tried
to
dance
the
lancers
and
have
fallen
out
about
the
figure
two
were
overturned
the
unwashed

were
tossed

tipsy

leaned
in
drunken
fashion
against
the
wall
and
under
its
boughs
lay
a
forgotten
child
asleep
on
the
other
side
of
the
cabin
an
empty
whisky
bottle
caught
a
ray
of
light
from
the
fire
and
glinted
feebly
back
among
the
ashes
on
the
hearth
was
a
screw
of
paper
charred
at
one
end
and
thrown
there
after
lighting

the
boy
opened
it
the
famous
programme
of
the
yukon
symposium
it
been
a
different
sort
of
christmas
from
what
we
planned
observed
the
colonel
not
quite
as
gaily
as
you
might
expect

stretching

interminable
legs
ye
say
we
have

glad

of

interrupts
the
boy
throwing
the
programme
in
the
fire
let
look
at
your
nugget
again
and
they
all
took
turns
except
potts

was
busy

it
was
a
good
many
days
before
they
got
the
dazzle
of
that
gold
out
of
their
eyes
they
found
their
tongues
again
and
talked
min√≥ok
from
morning
till
night
among
themselves
and
with
the
rare
passer
up
or
down
the
trail
mac
began
to
think
they
might
get
dogs
at
anvik
or
at
one
of
the
ingalik
villages
a
little
further
on
the
balance
of
opinion
in
the
camp
was
against
this
view
but
he
had
potts
on
his
side
when
the
new
year
opened
the
trail
was
in
capital
condition
on
the
second
of
january
two
lots
of
indians
passed
one
with
dogs
hauling
flour
and
bacon
for
benham
and
the
other
lot
without
dogs
dragging
light
potts
said
restlessly
after
all
can
do
it
so
can
we
if
we
a
mind
to
said
mac
come
on
then
the
camp
tried
hard
to
dissuade
them
naturally
neither
listened
they
packed
the
boy
sled
and
set
off
on
the
morning
of
the
third
to
kaviak
unbounded
surprise
and
disgust
his
view
of
life
being
that
wherever
mac
went
he
was
bound
to
follow
and
he
did
follow
made
off
as
hard
as
his
swift
little
feet
could
carry
him
straight
up
the
yukon
trail
and
farva
lost
a
good
half
of
that
first
morning
bringing
him
home
just
eight
days
later
the
two
men
walked
into
the
cabin
and
sat
down
potts
with
a
groan
mac
with
his
jaw
almost
dislocated
in
his
attempt
to
set
his
face
against
defeat
their
lips
were
cracked
with
the
cold
their
faces
raw
from
frostbite
their
eyes
inflamed
the
weather
they
called
it
the
weather
had
been
too
much
for
them
it
was
obvious
they
had
brought
back
any
dogs
but
what
did
you
think
of
anvik
says
the
boy
anvik
you
do
suppose
we
got
to
anvik
in
weather
like
this
how
far
you
get
mac
did
answer
potts
only
groaned
he
had
frozen
his
cheek
and
his
right
hand
they
were
doctored
and
put
to
bed
did
you
see
my
friends
at
holy
cross
the
boy
asked
potts
when
he
brought
him
a
bowl
of
hot
you
do
suppose
we
got
as
far
as
holy
cross
with
the
wind
well
where
you
get
to
where
you
been
second
native
village
above
why
that
is
more
sixteen
miles
sixteen
miles
too
far
potts
breathed
long
and
deep
between
hot
and
comforting
swallows
where
the
boy
sled
said
the
colonel
coming
in
hurriedly
we
cached
it
answered
potts
feebly
could
even
bring
his
sled
home
you
cached
it
it
all
right
only
a
few
miles
back
potts
relinquished
the
empty
and
closed
his
eyes
when
he
opened
them
again
late
in
the
evening
it
was
to
say
found
some
o
those
suckers
who
were
goin
so
slick
to
min√≥ok
some
down
at
the
second
village
and
the
rest
are
winterin
in
anvik
so
the
indians
say
not
a
single
son
of
a
gun
will
see
the
diggins
till
the
ice
goes
out
then
badly
off
as
we
are
here
says
the
colonel
to
the
boy
lucky
for
us
we
did
join
the
procession
when
mac
and
the
boy
brought
the
sled
home
a
couple
of
days
later
it
was
found
that
a
portion
of
its
cargo
consisted
of
a
toy
kyak
and
two
bottles
of
hootchino
the
maddening
drink
concocted
by
the
natives
out
of
fermented
dough
and
sugar
apart
from
the
question
of
drinking
raised
again
by
the
hootch
it
is
perhaps
possible
that
having
so
little
else
to
do
they
were
ready
to
eat
the
more
it
is
also
true
that
busy
or
idle
the
human
body
requires
more
nourishment
in
the
north
than
it
does
in
the
south
certainly
the
men
of
the
little
yukon
camp
began
to
find
their
rations
horribly
short
commons
and
to
suffer
a
continual
hunger
never
wholly
appeased
it
is
conditions
like
these
that
bring
out
the
brute
latent
in
all
men
the
day
came
to
mean
three
scant
meals
each
meal
came
to
mean
a
silent
struggle
in
each
man
soul
not
to
let
his
stomach
get
the
better
of
his
head
and
heart
at
first
they
joked
and
laughed
about
their
hunger
and
the
scarcity
it
became
too
serious
the
jest
was
and
rang
false
they
had
in
the
beginning
each
helped
himself
from
common
dishes
set
in
the
middle
of
the
rough
plank
table
later
each
found
how
without
meaning
to
hating
himself
for
it
he
watched
food
on
its
way
to
others
plates
with
an
evil
eye
when
it
came
to
his
turn
he
had
an
struggle
with
himself
not
to
take
the
lion
share
there
were
ironical
comments
now
and
then
and
bitterness
no
one
of
the
five
would
have
believed
he
could
feel
so
towards
a
human
being
about
a
morsel
of
food
but
those
who
think
they
would
be
above
it
have
not
wintered
in
the
arctic
regions
or
fought
in
the
boer
war
the
difficulty
was
frankly
faced
at
last
and
it
was
ordained
in
council
that
the
colonel
should
be
dispenser
of
the
food
ca
say
i
like
the
office
quoth
he
but
here
goes
and
he
cut
the
bacon
with
an
anxious
hand
and
spooned
out
the
beans
solemnly
as
if
he
weighed
each
go
and
the
trio
presently
retired
to
the
little
cabin
to
discuss
whether
the
colonel
did
show
favouritism
to
the
boy
and
when
mac
was
asleep
how
they
could
get
rid
of
kaviak
so
presently
another
council
was
called
and
the
colonel
resigned
his
office
stipulating
that
each
man
in
turn
should
hold
it
for
a
week
and
learn
how
ungrateful
it
was
moreover
that
whoever
was
for
the
nonce
occupying
the
painful
post
should
be
loyally
upheld
by
all
the
others
which
arrangement
was
in
force
to
the
end
and
still
on
grounds
political
religious
social
trivial
the
disaffection
grew
two
of
the
trio
sided
against
the
odd
man
potts
and
turned
him
out
of
the
little
cabin
one
night
during
a
furious
snowstorm
that
had
already
lasted
two
days
had
more
than
half
buried
the
hut
and
nearly
snowed
up
the
little
doorway
the
colonel
and
the
boy
had
been
shovelling
nearly
all
the
day
before
to
keep
free
the
entrance
to
the
big
cabin
and
the
precious
bottle
window
as
well
as
their
half
of
the
path
between
the
two
dwellings
and
potts
had
played
poker
and
quarrelled
as
usual
the
morning
after
the
ejection
of
potts
and
his
unwilling
reception
at
the
big
cabin
mac
and
failed
to
appear
for
breakfast
guess
they
huffy
says
potts
stretching
out
his
feet
very
comfortable
in
their
mucklucks
before
the
big
blaze
bring
on
the
coffee
kaviak
no
says
the
colonel
we
wo
begin
without
the
other
fellows
by
the
living
jingo
will
then
says
potts
and
helps
himself
under
the
colonel
angry
eyes
the
other
two
conferred
a
moment
then
drew
on
their
parkis
and
mittens
and
with
great
difficulty
in
spite
of
yesterday
work
got
the
door
open
it
was
pretty
dark
but
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
the
little
cabin
had
disappeared
look
is
that
a
curl
of
smoke
said
the
boy
yes
by
george
they
snowed
under
serve
right
a
heavy
sigh
from
the
colonel
yes
but
have
to
dig
out
look
here
colonel
the
boy
spoke
with
touching
solemnity
before
breakfast
right
you
are
laughed
the
colonel
and
they
went
in
it
was
that
day
after
the
others
had
been
released
and
fed
that
the
boy
fell
out
with
potts
concerning
who
had
lost
the
hatchet
and
they
came
to
blows
a
black
eye
and
a
bloody
nose
might
not
seem
an
illuminating
contribution
to
the
question
but
no
more
was
said
about
the
hatchet
after
the
colonel
had
dragged
the
boy
off
the
prostrate
form
of
his
adversary
but
the
colonel
himself
lost
his
temper
two
days
later
when
broached
the
seal
set
months
before
on
the
nearly
empty
demijohn
for
those
famous
temperance
punches
the
colonel
had
drawn
on
his
own
small
stock
he
saw
his
blunder
when
possessing
himself
of
the
demijohn
roared
out
it
my
whisky
i
tell
you
i
bought
it
and
paid
furr
it
and
but
for
me
it
would
be
at
the
bottom
o
the
yukon
now
yes
and
you
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
yukon
yourself
if
you
been
dragged
out
by
the
scruff
o
your
neck
and
you
be
in
a
pretty
fix
now
if
we
left
you
alone
with
your
whisky
which
is
about
all
you
got
we
agreed
potts
chipped
in
that
it
should
be
kept
for
medicinal
purposes
only
sullenly
sipped
at
his
grog
potts
had
hogged
most
of
the
hootch
look
here
boy
said
mac
at
supper
i
said
i
would
eat
off
this
plate
again
oh
dry
up
one
tin
plate
like
another
tin
plate
are
you
reflecting
on
the
mr
maccann
asked
potts
i
saying
what
i
said
before
that
i
scratched
my
name
on
my
plate
and
i
wo
eat
off
this
rusty
battered
he
held
it
up
as
if
to
shy
it
at
the
boy
the
young
fellow
turned
with
a
flash
in
his
eye
and
stood
taut
then
in
the
pause
he
said
quite
low
let
her
fly
maccann
but
maccann
thought
better
of
it
he
threw
the
plate
down
on
the
table
with
a
clatter
the
colonel
jumped
up
and
bent
over
the
at
the
fire
beside
the
boy
whispering
to
him
oh
all
right
when
the
boy
turned
back
to
the
table
with
the
smoking
kettle
the
cloud
had
gone
from
his
face
maccann
had
got
up
to
hang
a
blanket
over
the
door
while
his
back
was
turned
the
boy
brought
a
tin
plate
still
in
good
condition
set
it
down
at
mac
place
planted
a
nail
on
end
in
the
middle
and
with
three
blows
from
a
hammer
fastened
the
plate
firmly
to
the
board
maybe
you
ca
hand
it
up
for
more
as
often
as
you
like
but
always
find
it
there
he
said
when
mccann
came
back
and
the
laugh
went
against
the
dainty
pioneer
who
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
ate
from
a
plate
nailed
fast
to
the
table
i
begin
to
understand
says
the
colonel
to
the
boy
under
cover
of
the
others
talk
why
it
said
to
be
such
a
devil
of
a
test
of
a
fellow
decency
to
winter
in
this
infernal
country
they
say
it
always
a
man
pardner
he
comes
to
hate
most
returned
the
boy
laughing
at
the
colonel
naturally
look
at
the
row
in
the
little
cabin
that
has
been
the
only
row
the
boy
went
on
more
thoughtfully
i
say
colonel
he
lowered
his
voice
do
you
know
there
have
to
be
a
new
system
of
rations
i
been
afraid
now
i
the
grub
last
till
the
ice
goes
out
i
know
it
said
the
colonel
very
gravely
was
there
a
miscalculation
i
hope
it
was
that
or
else
speaking
still
lower
the
stores
have
been
tampered
with
and
not
by
kaviak
either
there
be
a
hell
of
a
row
he
looked
up
and
saw
potts
watching
them
suspiciously
it
had
come
to
this
if
two
men
talked
low
the
others
pricked
their
ears
but
lack
of
grub
resumed
the
colonel
in
his
usual
voice
as
though
he
had
not
noticed
is
only
one
of
our
difficulties
lack
of
work
is
just
about
as
bad
it
breeds
a
thousand
devils
we
a
pack
o
fools
here
we
are
all
of
us
hard
hit
some
of
us
pretty
well
cleaned
out
ready
cash
and
here
dollars
and
dollars
all
round
us
and
we
sit
over
the
fire
like
a
lot
of
natives
dollars
where
growin
on
the
trees
boys
a
forest
full
oh
timber
enthusiasm
cooled
look
at
what
they
say
about
those
fellows
up
at
anvik
what
they
made
last
year
they
got
a
they
have
but
they
cut
and
sold
to
the
steamers
two
years
before
they
got
a
mill
and
next
summer
will
be
the
biggest
season
yet
we
ought
to
have
set
to
as
soon
as
the
cabins
were
built
and
cut
wood
for
the
summer
traffic
but
since
there
are
five
of
us
we
can
make
a
good
thing
of
it
yet
the
colonel
finally
carried
the
day
they
went
at
it
next
morning
and
as
the
projector
of
the
work
had
privately
predicted
a
better
spirit
prevailed
in
the
camp
for
some
time
but
here
were
five
men
only
one
of
whom
had
had
any
of
the
steadying
grace
of
stiff
discipline
in
his
life
men
of
haphazard
education
who
had
chucked
more
or
less
easy
berths
in
a
land
of
many
creature
comforts
for
this
to
fell
and
haul
birch
and
fir
trees
in
an
arctic
climate
on
it
began
to
be
apparent
that
the
same
spirit
was
invading
the
forest
that
had
possession
of
the
camp
two
or
at
most
three
did
the
work
and
the
rest
shirked
got
and
rheumatism
and
let
the
others
do
his
share
counting
securely
nevertheless
on
his
fifth
of
the
proceeds
just
as
he
counted
no
matter
what
proportion
he
had
contributed
on
his
full
share
of
the
common
stock
of
food
i
came
out
here
a
communist
said
the
boy
one
day
to
the
colonel
and
an
agnostic
smiled
the
older
man
oh
i
an
agnostic
all
right
now
and
for
ever
but
this
winter
has
cured
my
faith
in
communism
early
february
brought
not
only
lengthening
daylight
but
a
radical
change
in
the
weather
the
woodsmen
worked
in
their
perspired
freely
and
said
in
the
innocence
of
their
hearts
if
winter
comes
early
up
here
spring
does
the
same
the
whole
hillside
was
one
slush
and
the
snow
melting
on
the
little
cabin
roof
brought
a
into
the
upper
bunk
few
things
in
nature
so
surely
stir
the
pulse
of
man
as
the
untimely
coming
of
a
few
spring
days
that
have
lost
their
way
in
the
calendar
and
wandered
into
winter
no
trouble
now
to
get
the
big
chimney
men
away
from
the
fireside
they
held
up
their
bloodless
faces
in
the
faint
sunshine
and
their
eyes
with
the
pupils
enlarged
by
the
long
reign
of
night
blinked
feebly
like
an
owl
forced
to
face
the
morning
there
were
none
of
those
signs
in
the
animal
world
outside
of
premature
stir
and
cheerful
awaking
that
in
other
lands
help
the
illusion
that
winter
lies
behind
but
there
was
that
even
more
stimulating
sweet
air
abroad
that
subtle
mixture
of
sun
and
yielding
frost
that
softened
wind
that
comes
blowing
across
the
snow
still
keen
to
the
cheek
but
subtly
reviving
to
the
sensitive
nostril
and
caressing
to
the
eyes
the
big
chimney
men
drew
deep
breaths
and
said
in
their
hearts
the
battle
was
over
and
won
kaviak
for
ever
following
at
mac
heels
like
a
rale
irish
tarrier
found
his
allegiance
waver
in
these
stirring
blissful
days
if
ever
farva
so
belied
character
and
custom
as
to
swing
an
axe
for
any
length
of
time
plainly
out
of
patience
kaviak
would
throw
off
the
coat
and
run
about
in
wet
mucklucks
and
a
single
garment
uphill
downhill
on
important
errands
which
he
confided
to
no
man
it
is
part
of
the
sorcery
of
such
days
that
men
thoughts
like
birds
turn
to
other
places
impatient
of
the
haven
that
gave
them
shelter
in
rough
weather
overpast
the
big
chimney
men
leaned
on
their
axes
and
looked
north
south
east
west
then
the
colonel
would
give
a
little
start
turn
about
lift
his
and
swing
it
frontier
fashion
first
over
one
shoulder
then
over
the
other
striking
cleanly
home
each
time
working
with
a
kind
of
splendid
rhythm
more
harmonious
more
beautiful
to
look
at
than
most
of
the
works
of
men
this
was
perhaps
the
view
of
his
comrades
for
they
did
a
good
deal
of
looking
at
the
colonel
he
said
he
was
a
modest
man
and
did
like
it
and
mac
turning
a
little
rusty
under
the
gibe
answered
have
you
got
the
sense
to
see
we
cut
all
the
good
timber
just
round
here
and
again
he
turned
his
eyes
to
the
horizon
line
mac
right
said
the
boy
and
even
the
colonel
stood
still
a
moment
and
they
all
looked
away
to
that
land
at
the
end
of
the
world
where
the
best
materials
are
for
the
building
of
castles
it
the
same
country
so
plainly
pointed
out
by
the
rainbow
end
and
never
so
much
as
in
the
springtime
does
it
lure
men
with
its
ancient
promise
come
along
colonel
let
go
and
look
for
real
timber
and
let
find
it
nearer
where
the
steamers
can
see
it
right
away
what
about
the
kid
me
come
said
kaviak
with
a
highly
obliging
air
no
you
stay
at
home
no
go
too
go
too
thou
babbler
kaviak
a
better
trail
man
than
some
i
could
mention
we
have
to
carry
him
home
objected
potts
now
do
tell
us
you
do
any
of
the
carryin
or
we
lose
confidence
in
you
potts
the
trail
was
something
awful
but
on
their
canadian
snowshoes
they
got
as
far
as
an
island
six
miles
off
one
end
of
it
was
better
wooded
than
any
easily
accessible
place
they
had
seen
why
this
is
quite
like
real
spruce
said
the
boy
and
admitted
that
even
in
california
these
here
would
be
called
wid
no
intintion
o
bein
sarcaustic
so
they
cut
holes
in
the
ice
and
sounded
for
the
channel
yes
sir
the
steamers
can
make
a
landin
here
and
here
where
have
our
they
went
home
in
better
spirits
than
they
had
been
in
since
that
welter
of
gold
had
lain
on
the
big
cabin
table
but
a
few
days
sufficed
to
wear
the
novelty
off
the
new
wood
camp
for
most
of
the
party
potts
and
set
out
in
the
opposite
direction
one
morning
with
a
and
provisions
to
last
several
days
they
were
sick
of
bacon
and
beans
and
were
goin
huntin
no
one
could
deny
that
a
moose
or
even
a
grouse
anything
in
the
shape
of
fresh
meat
was
sufficiently
needed
but
potts
and
were
really
sick
and
sore
from
their
recent
slight
attack
of
they
were
after
bigger
game
too
as
well
as
grouse
and
a
few
days
off
it
had
turned
just
enough
colder
to
glaze
the
trail
and
put
it
in
fine
condition
they
went
down
the
river
to
the
were
generously
entertained
by
captain
rainey
and
learned
that
with
earlier
contracts
on
his
hands
he
did
not
want
more
wood
from
them
than
they
had
already
corded
they
returned
to
the
camp
without
game
but
with
plenty
of
whisky
and
information
that
freed
them
from
the
yoke
of
labour
and
from
the
lash
of
ironic
comment
in
vain
the
colonel
urged
that
the
was
not
the
only
steamer
plying
the
yukon
that
with
the
big
rush
of
the
coming
season
the
traffic
would
be
enormous
and
a
as
good
as
a
gold
mine
the
cause
was
lost
you
wo
get
us
to
make
of
ourselves
on
the
of
selling
rainey
says
that
wood
camps
have
sprung
up
like
mushrooms
all
along
the
river
the
price
of
wood
will
go
down
to
all
along
the
river
there
is
one
between
us
and
andreievsky
nor
between
here
and
holy
cross
but
it
was
no
use
the
travellers
pledged
each
other
in
whisky
and
making
a
common
cause
once
more
the
original
trio
put
in
a
night
of
it
the
boy
and
the
colonel
turned
into
their
bunks
at
eleven
they
were
roused
in
the
small
hours
by
kaviak
frightened
crying
and
the
noise
of
angry
voices
you

the
kid

mesilf
that

on
the
sly
out
o

siven
you

a
movement
a
stool
overturned
and
the
two
men
in
the
bunks
were
struck
broad
awake
by
the
smart
concussion
of
a
nobody
was
hurt
and
between
them
they
disarmed
potts
and
turned
the
irishman
out
to
cool
off
in
his
own
cabin
it
was
all
over
in
a
minute
kaviak
reassured
curled
down
to
sleep
again
mac
and
potts
stretched
themselves
on
the
half
under
the
table
and
speedily
fell
to
snoring
the
boy
put
on
some
logs
he
and
the
colonel
sat
and
watched
the
sparks
it
a
bad
business

ca
go
on
says
the
colonel
but
mac
right
kaviak
being
here
is
to
blame

are
like
a
lot
of
the
boy
nodded

and
bang
and
some
of
us

the
colonel

no
excuse
said
the
elder
man
almost
angrily
same
excuse
as
you
the
colonel
shook
his
head
exactly
maintained
the
boy
tired
of
towns
and
and
and
the
boy
shifted
about
on
his
wooden
stool
and
held
up
his
hands
to
the
reviving
blaze
life

us
steady
fellows

year
of
freedom

year
to

the
klondyke
eh
and
he
laughed
again
and
presently
he
yawned
and
tumbled
back
into
his
bunk
but
he
put
his
head
out
in
a
moment
are
you
going
to
bed
yes
the
colonel
stood
up
did
you
know
father
wills
went
by
last
night
when
those
fellows
began
to
row
about
getting
out
the
whisky
no
he
says
there
another
stampede
on
where
to
koyukuk
this
time
why
did
he
come
in
awful
hurry
to
get
to
somebody
that
sent
for
him
funny
fellas
these
jesuits
they
all
those
odd
things
they
teach
so
do
other
men
said
the
colonel
curtly
well
i
lived
in
a
christian
country
all
my
life
but
i
do
know
that
i
ever
saw
christianity
till
i
went
up
the
yukon
to
holy
cross
i
must
say
you
complimentary
to
the
few
other
christians
scattered
about
the
world
do
get
mifft
colonel
i
known
plenty
of
people
straight
as
a
die
and
capital
good
fellows
i
seen
them
do
very
decent
things
now
and
then
but
with
these
jesuit
missionaries
lord
there
no
let
up
to
it
no
answer
from
the
protestant
colonel
presently
the
boy
in
a
sleepy
voice
added
elegantly
no
siree
the
jesuits
go
the
whole
hog
winter
was
down
on
the
camp
again
the
whole
world
was
hard
as
iron
the
men
kept
close
to
the
big
chimney
all
day
long
and
sat
there
far
into
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
saying
little
and
sullen
the
dreaded
insomnia
of
the
arctic
had
laid
hold
on
all
but
the
colonel
even
his
usually
unbroken
repose
was
again
disturbed
one
night
about
a
week
later
some
vague
sort
of
sound
or
movement
in
the
room
kaviak
on
a
raid
or
was
that
the
closing
of
a
door
kaviak
he
put
his
hand
down
and
felt
the
straight
hair
of
the
esquimaux
in
the
under
bunk
potts
who
there
he
half
sat
up
boy
did
you
hear
that
boy
he
leaned
far
down
over
the
side
and
saw
distinctly
by
the
there
was
nobody
but
kaviak
in
the
under
bunk
the
colonel
was
on
his
legs
in
a
flash
putting
his
head
through
his
parki
and
drawing
on
his
mucklucks
he
did
wait
to
cross
and
tie
the
thongs
a
presentiment
of
evil
was
strong
upon
him
outside
in
the
faint
he
thought
a
dim
shape
was
passing
down
towards
the
river
who
that
hi
there
stop
or
i
shoot
he
had
brought
his
gun
but
the
ruse
worked
do
shoot
came
back
the
voice
of
the
boy
the
colonel
stumbled
down
the
bank
in
the
snow
and
soon
stood
by
the
shape
the
boy
was
dressed
for
a
journey
his
arctic
cap
was
drawn
down
over
his
ears
and
neck
the
fringe
of
his
parki
hood
stood
out
fiercely
round
the
defiant
young
face
wound
about
one
of
his
mittens
was
the
rope
of
the
new
he
been
fashioning
so
busily
of
nights
by
the
camp
fire
his
two
blankets
were
strapped
on
the
sled
indian
fashion
along
with
a
gunny
sack
and
his
rifle
the
two
men
stood
looking
angrily
at
each
other
a
moment
and
then
the
colonel
politely
inquired
what
in
hell
are
you
doing
goin
to
min√≥ok
the
devil
you
are
yes
the
devil
i
am
they
stood
measuring
each
other
in
the
dim
light
till
the
eyes
fell
on
the
loaded
sled
the
boy
followed
i
only
taken
short
rations
for
two
weeks
i
left
a
statement
in
the
cabin
it
about
a
fifth
of
what
my
share
so
there
no
need
of
a
row
what
are
you
goin
for
why
to
be
first
in
the
field
and
stake
a
of
course
the
colonel
laid
a
rough
hand
on
the
boy
shoulder
he
shook
it
off
impatiently
and
before
the
older
man
could
speak
look
here
let
talk
sense
somebody
got
to
go
or
there
be
trouble
potts
says
kaviak
but
what
difference
would
kaviak
make
been
afraid
you
get
ahead
of
me
i
watched
you
for
a
week
like
a
hawk
watches
a
chicken
but
it
clear
i
the
one
to
go
he
pulled
up
the
rope
of
the
sled
and
his
little
cargo
lurched
towards
him
the
colonel
stepped
in
front
of
him
boy
he
began
but
something
was
the
matter
with
his
voice
he
got
no
further
i
the
youngest
boasted
the
other
and
i
the
strongest
and
the
hungriest
the
colonel
found
a
perturbed
and
husky
voice
in
which
to
say
i
did
know
you
were
such
a
christian
nothin
o
the
sort
what
this
but
why
it
just
just
my
little
scheme
you
no
fool
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
you
got
the
devil
own
job
in
hand
somebody
got
to
go
he
repeated
doggedly
look
here
said
the
colonel
you
have
impressed
me
as
being
tired
of
life
tired
of
life
the
young
eyes
flashed
in
that
weird
aureole
of
long
tired
of
life
well
i
should
just
pretty
nearly
think
i
was
h
then
if
it
is
christianity
it
must
be
because
you
young
golly
man
it
because
i
hungry
hungry
great
jehosaphat
i
could
eat
an
ox
and
you
leave
your
grub
behind
to
be
eaten
by
a
lot
of
i
ca
stand
here
argyfying
with
the
thermometer
down
to
the
boy
began
to
drag
the
sled
over
the
snow
come
back
into
the
cabin
no
come
with
me
i
say
i
got
something
to
propose
again
the
colonel
stood
in
front
barring
the
way
look
here
he
went
on
gently
are
you
a
friend
of
mine
oh
growled
the
boy
but
after
looking
about
him
for
an
angry
second
or
two
he
flung
down
the
rope
of
his
sled
walked
sulkily
uphill
and
kicked
off
his
at
the
door
of
the
cabin
all
with
the
air
of
one
who
waits
but
is
not
baulked
of
his
purpose
they
went
in
and
stripped
off
their
furs
now
see
here
if
you
made
up
your
mind
to
light
out
i
not
going
to
oppose
you
why
did
you
say
anything
as
sensible
as
that
out
yonder
because
i
wo
be
ready
to
go
along
till
you
yep
there
was
a
little
silence
i
wish
you
would
colonel
it
dangerous
alone
not
for
two
yes
it
is
dangerous
and
you
know
it
i
goin
along
laddie
seeing
the
boy
look
precious
grave
and
harassed
what
the
matter
i
hate
awfully
for
anything
to
happen
to
you
the
colonel
laughed
much
obliged
but
it
matters
uncommon
little
if
i
do
drop
in
my
tracks
you
be
blowed
you
see
i
got
a
pretty
bad
kind
of
a
complaint
anyhow
the
boy
leaned
over
in
the
firelight
and
scanned
the
colonel
face
what
wrong
the
colonel
smiled
a
queer
little
smile
i
been
out
kelter
nearly
ten
years
oh
all
right
you
go
on
for
another
thirty
if
you
stay
where
you
are
till
the
ice
goes
out
the
colonel
bent
his
head
and
stared
at
the
floor
at
the
edge
of
the
to
tell
the
truth
i
be
glad
to
go
not
only
because
of
he
hitched
his
shoulders
towards
the
corner
whence
came
the
hoarse
and
muffled
breathing
of
the
denver
clerk
be
glad
to
have
something
to
tire
me
out
so
i
sleep
sleep
too
sound
to
dream
that
what
i
came
for
not
to
sit
idle
in
a
cabin
and
think
think
he
got
up
suddenly
and
strode
the
tiny
space
from
fire
to
door
a
man
transformed
with
hands
clenching
and
dark
face
almost
evil
they
say
the
men
who
winter
up
here
either
take
to
drink
or
go
mad
i
begin
to
see
it
is
so
it
no
place
to
do
any
forgetting
in
he
stopped
suddenly
before
the
boy
with
glittering
eyes
it
the
country
where
your
conscience
finds
you
out
that
religion
of
yours
is
makin
you
morbid
colonel
the
boy
spoke
with
the
detached
and
soothing
air
of
a
sage
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
he
turned
sharply
away
the
boy
relapsed
into
silence
the
colonel
in
his
renewed
prowling
brought
up
against
the
wooden
crane
he
stood
looking
down
into
the
fire
loud
and
regular
sounded
the
sleeping
man
breathing
in
the
quiet
little
room
i
did
a
wrong
once
to
a
woman
ten
years
ago
said
the
colonel
speaking
to
the
although
i
loved
her
he
raised
a
hand
to
his
eyes
with
a
queer
choking
sound
i
loved
her
he
repeated
still
with
his
back
to
the
boy
i
could
have
righted
it
but
she
she
was
the
kind
to
hang
about
and
wait
on
a
man
better
nature
when
once
he
shown
himself
a
coward
she
skipped
the
country
he
leaned
his
head
against
the
end
of
the
shelf
over
the
fire
and
said
no
more
go
back
in
the
spring
find
out
where
she
is
and
i
spent
every
spring
and
every
summer
every
fall
and
every
winter
till
this
one
trying
to
do
just
that
thing
you
ca
find
her
nobody
can
find
her
she
dead
she
dead
the
boy
involuntarily
shrank
back
the
colonel
looked
ready
to
smash
him
the
action
recalled
the
older
man
to
himself
i
feel
sure
she
is
dead
he
said
more
quietly
but
still
trembling
no
no
she
is
dead
she
had
some
money
of
her
own
and
she
went
abroad
i
followed
her
i
heard
of
her
in
paris
in
rome
i
saw
her
once
in
a
droschky
in
vienna
there
i
lost
the
trail
her
people
said
she
gone
to
japan
went
to
japan
i
sure
she
in
the
islands
i
spent
my
life
since
trying
to
find
her
writing
her
letters
that
always
come
back
trying
his
voice
went
out
like
a
suddenly
dying
in
the
socket
only
the
sleeper
was
audible
for
full
five
minutes
then
as
though
he
had
paused
only
a
space
the
colonel
went
on
i
been
trying
to
put
the
memory
of
her
behind
me
as
a
sane
man
should
but
some
women
leave
an
arrow
sticking
in
your
flesh
that
you
can
never
pull
out
you
can
only
jar
against
it
and
cringe
under
the
agony
of
the
reminder
all
your
life
long
bah
go
out
boy
and
bring
in
your
sled
and
the
boy
obeyed
without
a
word
two
days
after
three
men
with
a
child
stood
in
front
of
the
larger
cabin
saying
to
their
two
comrades
who
were
starting
out
on
to
do
a
little
matter
of
miles
of
arctic
travelling
with
two
weeks
scant
provisioning
some
tea
and
things
for
trading
bedding
two
rifles
and
a
kettle
all
packed
on
one
little
there
had
been
some
unexpected
feeling
and
even
some
real
generosity
shown
at
the
last
on
the
part
of
the
three
who
were
to
profit
by
the
exodus
falling
heir
thereby
to
a
bigger
warmer
cabin
and
more
food
was
moved
to
make
several
touching
remonstrances
it
was
a
sign
of
unwonted
emotion
on
mac
part
that
he
gave
up
arguing
sacrificing
all
the
delight
of
a
set
debate
and
simply
begged
and
prayed
them
not
to
be
fools
not
to
fly
in
the
face
of
providence
but
potts
was
made
of
sterner
stuff
besides
the
thing
was
too
good
to
be
true
when
he
found
they
were
not
to
be
dissuaded
solemnly
presented
each
with
a
little
bottle
of
whisky
nobody
would
have
believed
would
go
so
far
as
that
nor
could
anyone
have
anticipated
that
mac
would
give
the
boy
his
valuable
aneroid
barometer
and
compass
or
that
potts
would
be
so
generous
with
his
best

filling
the
colonel

without
so
much
as

said
the
colonel
and
the
men
grasped
hands
potts
shook
hands
with
the
boy
as
heartily
as
though
that
same
hand
had
never
half
throttled
him

the
two

looked

laughing
and
nodding
as
jolly
as

the
boy
stooped
made
a
and
fired
it
at
kaviak
the
child
ducked
chuckling
and
returned
as
good
as
he
got
his
loosely
packed
ball
broke
in
a
splash
on
the
back
of
the
boy
parki
and
kaviak
was
loudly
cheered
still
as
they
went
forward
they
looked
back
the
big
chimney
wore
an
air
wondrous
friendly
and
the
wide
white
world
looked
coldly
at
them
with
small
pretence
of
welcome
or
reward
i
do
believe
i
ever
really
knew
how
awful
jolly
the
big
chimney
was
till
this
minute
the
colonel
smiled
hardly
like
myself
to
think
whatever
else
i
see
i
never
see
that
again
better
not
boast
the
colonel
went
on
in
front
breaking
trail
in
the
newfallen
snow
the
boy
pulling
the
sled
behind
him
as
lightly
as
if
its
double
burden
were
a
feather
they
look
as
if
they
thought
it
be
a
picnic
says
mac
grimly
i
wonder
be
the
siven
howly
pipers
will
we
iver
see
ayther
of
again
if
they
only
stay
a
couple
o
nights
at
anvik
said
potts
with
gloomy
foreboding
they
could
get
back
here
inside
a
week
no
answered
mac
following
the
two
figures
with
serious
eyes
they
may
be
dead
inside
a
week
but
they
wo
be
back
here
and
potts
felt
his
anxiety
eased
a
man
who
had
mined
at
caribou
ought
to
know
chapter

princess
muckluck
we
all
went
to
tibbals
to
see
the
kinge
who
used
my
mother
and
my
aunt
very
gratiouslie
but
we
all
saw
a
great
chaunge
betweene
the
fashion
of
the
court
as
it
was
now
and
of

in

for
we
were
all

of
it
was
the
of
february
that
first
day
that
they
hit
the
long
trail
temperature
only
about
twenty
degrees
the
colonel
thought
and
so
little
wind
it
had
the
effect
of
being
warmer
trail
in
fair
condition
weather
gray
and
steady
never
men
in
better
spirits
to
have
left
the
wrangling
and
the
smouldering
danger
of
the
camp
behind
that
alone
as
the
boy
said
was
worth
the
price
of
admission
exhilarating
too
to
men
of
their
temperament
to
have
cut
the
gordian
knot
of
the
difficulty
by
risking
themselves
on
this
unprecedented
quest
for
peace
and
food
gold
too
oh
yes
with
a
smile
to
see
how
far
that
main
object
had
drifted
into
the
background
they
added
and
for
gold
they
believed
they
had
hearkened
well
to
the
counsel
that
bade
them
travel
light
remember
every
added
ounce
is
against
you
nobody
in
the
north
owns
anything
that
heavy
had
been
said
in
one
fashion
or
another
so
often
that
it
lost
its
ironic
sound
in
the
ears
of
men
who
had
come
so
far
to
carry
away
one
of
the
heaviest
things
under
the
sun
the
colonel
and
the
boy
took
no
tent
no
stove
not
even
a
miner
pick
and
pan
these
last
general
lighter
had
said
could
be
obtained
at

and
there
is
a
cabin
on
the
trail
dillon
had
added
without
for
the
rest
the
pack
on
the
sled
contained
the
woollen
blankets
a
change
of
flannels
apiece
a
couple
of
sweaters
a
norfolk
jacket
and
several
changes
of
this
last
item

dwelt
on
earnestly
by

john
dillon
had
said
and
leave
the
rest
to

almighty
they
were
taking
barely
two
weeks
rations
and
a
certain
amount
of
stuff
to
trade
with
the
indians
when
their
supplies
should
be
gone
they
carried
a
kettle
an
axe
some
quinine
a
box
of
the
carbolic
ointment
all
miners
use
for
whisky
and
two
rifles
and
ammunition
in
spite
of
having
eliminated
many
things
that
most
travellers
would
count
essential
they
found
their
load
came
to
a
little
over
two
hundred
pounds
but
every
day
would
lessen
it
they
told
each
other
with
a
laugh
and
with
an
inward
misgiving
lest
the
lightening
should
come
all
too
quickly
they
had
seen
in
camp
that
winter
so
much
of
the
frailty
of
human
temper
that
although
full
of
faith
by
now
in
each
other
native
sense
and
fairness
they
left
nothing
to
a
haphazard
division
of
labour
they
parcelled
out
the
work
of
the
day
with
absolute
impartiality
to
each
man
so
many
hours
of
going
ahead
to
break
trail
if
the
snow
was
soft
while
the
other
dragged
the
sled
or
else
while
one
pulled
in
front
the
other
pushed
from
behind
in
regular
shifts
by
the
watch
turn
and
turn
about
the
colonel
had
cooked
all
winter
so
it
was
the
boy
turn
at
that
the
colonel
to
decide
the
best
place
to
camp
because
it
was
his
affair
to
find
seasoned
wood
for
fuel
his
to
build
the
fire
in
the
snow
on
green
logs
laid
close
together
his
to
chop
enough
wood
to
cook
breakfast
the
next
morning
all
this
they
had
arranged
before
they
left
the
big
chimney
that
they
did
not
cover
more
ground
that
first
day
was
a
pure
chance
not
likely
to
recur
due
to
an
unavoidable
loss
of
time
at
pymeut
knowing
the
fascination
that
place
exercised
over
his
companion
the
colonel
called
a
halt
about
seven
miles
off
from
the
big
chimney
that
they
might
quickly
despatch
a
little
cold
luncheon
they
carried
in
their
pockets
and
push
on
without
a
break
till
supper
we
got
no
time
to
waste
at
pymeut
observes
the
colonel
significantly
i
ai
achin
to
stop
at
pymeut
says
his
pardner
with
a
superior
air
standing
up
as
he
swallowed
his
last
mouthful
of
cold
bacon
and
and
cheerfully
surveyed
the
waste
who
says
it
cold
even
if
the
wind
is
up
and
the
track
bully
but
see
here
colonel
you
must
go
thinkin
it
smooth
like
this
all
the
way
oh
i
was
figurin
that
it
would
be
but
the
boy
paid
no
heed
to
the
irony
and
it
a
custom
o
the
country
to
get
the
wind
in
your
face
as
a
rule
whichever
way
you
go
well
i
not
complainin
as
yet
reckon
you
need
if
you
blown
like
all
the
way
to
min√≥ok
gee
the
wind
stronger
say
colonel
let
rig
a
sail
foolishness
no
sir
we
go
by
pymeut
in
an
lickety
split
and
be
a
good
excuse
for
not
stopping
though
i
think
we
ought
to
say
to
nicholas
this
view
inclined
the
colonel
to
think
better
of
an
he
had
once
crossed
the
bay
of
toronto
in
that
fashion
and
began
to
wonder
if
such
a
mode
of
progression
applied
to
sleds
might
not
aid
largely
in
solving
the
min√≥ok
problem
while
he
was
wondering
the
boy
unlashed
the
and
pulled
off
the
canvas
cover
as
the
colonel
came
back
with
his
mast
between
them
with
no
better
tools
than
axe
and
a
rope
and
with
fingers
freezing
in
the
south
wind
they
rigged
the
sail
the
fact
that
they
had
this
increasingly
favourable
wind
on
their
very
first
day
showed
that
they
were
specially
smiled
on
by
the
great
natural
forces
the
superstitious
feeling
that
only
slumbers
in
most
breasts
that
mother
nature
is
still
a
mysterious
being
who
has
her
favourites
whom
she
guards
her
born
enemies
whom
she
baulks
pursues
and
finally
overwhelms
the
childishness
stirred
pleasantly
in
both
men
and
in
the
younger
came
forth
unabashed
in
speech
i
tell
you
the
omens
are
good
this
expedition
goin
to
get
there
then
with
the
involuntary
misgiving
that
follows
hard
upon
such
boasting
he
laughed
uneasily
and
added
i
mean
to
sacrifice
the
first
deer
tongue
i
do
want
myself
to
yukon
inua
but
here
to
the
south
wind
he
turned
some
crumbs
out
of
his
pocket
and
saw
delighted
how
the
gale
grown
keener
snatched
eagerly
at
them
and
hurried
them
up
the
trail
the
careened
and
strained
eagerly
to
sail
away
the
two
laughing
like
schoolboys
sat
astride
the
pack
the
colonel
shook
out
the
canvas
and
they
scudded
off
up
the
river
like
mad
the
great
difficulty
was
the
steering
but
it
was
fun
the
boy
said
and
very
soon
there
were
natives
running
down
to
the
river
to
stare
at
the
astounding
apparition
to
point
and
shout
something
unintelligible
that
sounded
like
muchtaravik
why
it
the
pymeuts
pardner
we
be
in
min√≥ok
by
the
words
had
left
his
lips
when
he
saw
a
few
yards
in
front
of
them
a
faint
cloud
of
steam
rising
up
from
the
ice
that
dim
that
flies
above
an
the
colonel
never
noticing
was
heading
straight
for
the
ghastly
trap
god
colonel
gasped
the
boy
the
colonel
simply
rolled
off
the
pack
turning
over
and
over
on
the
ice
but
keeping
hold
of
the
rope
the
sled
swerved
turned
on
her
side
and
slid
along
with
a
sound
of
snapping
and
tearing
while
they
were
still
headed
straight
for
the
hole
the
boy
had
gathered
himself
for
a
clear
jump
to
the
right
but
the
sled
sudden
swerve
to
the
left
broke
his
angle
sharply
he
was
flung
forward
on
the
new
impetus
spun
over
the
smooth
surface
swept
across
the
verge
and
under
the
cloud
clutching
wildly
at
the
ragged
edge
of
ice
as
he
went
down
all
pymeut
had
come
rushing
the
colonel
was
gathering
himself
up
and
looking
round
in
a
dazed
kind
of
way
as
nicholas
flashed
by
just
beyond
in
that
yawning
hole
fully
ten
feet
wide
by
fifteen
long
the
boy
head
appeared
an
instant
and
then
was
lost
like
something
seen
in
a
dream
some
of
the
pymeuts
with
quick
knives
were
cutting
the
canvas
loose
one
end
was
passed
to
nicholas
he
knotted
it
to
his
belt
and
went
swiftly
but
gingerly
forward
nearer
the
perilous
edge
he
had
flung
himself
down
on
his
stomach
just
as
the
boy
rose
again
nicholas
lurched
his
body
over
the
brink
his
arms
outstretched
straining
farther
farther
yet
till
it
seemed
as
if
only
the
counterweight
of
the
rest
of
the
population
at
the
other
end
of
the
canvas
prevented
his
joining
the
boy
in
the
hole
but
nicholas
had
got
a
grip
of
him
and
while
two
of
the
pymeuts
hung
on
to
the
colonel
to
prevent
his
adding
to
the
complication
nicholas
with
a
good
deal
of
trouble
in
spite
of
yagorsha
help
hauled
the
boy
out
of
the
hole
and
dragged
him
up
on
the
the
others
applied
themselves
lustily
to
their
end
of
the
canvas
and
soon
they
were
all
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
yawning
danger
the
boy
predominant
feeling
had
been
one
of
intense
surprise
he
looked
round
and
a
hideous
misgiving
seized
him
anything
the
matter
with
you
colonel
his
tone
was
so
angry
that
as
they
stared
at
each
other
they
both
fell
to
laughing
well
i
rather
thought
that
was
what
was
going
to
say
and
kentucky
heaved
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
the
boy
teeth
began
to
chatter
and
his
clothes
were
soon
freezing
on
him
they
got
him
up
off
the
ice
and
nicholas
and
the
sturdy
old
pymeut
yagorsha
walked
him
or
ran
him
rather
the
rest
of
the
way
to
pymeut
for
they
were
not
so
near
the
village
as
the
travellers
had
supposed
on
seeing
nearly
the
whole
male
population
the
colonel
was
not
far
behind
and
several
of
the
bucks
were
bringing
the
disabled
sled
before
reaching
the
kachime
they
were
joined
by
the
women
and
children
muckluck
much
concerned
at
the
sight
of
her
friend
glazed
in
ice
from
head
to
heel
nicholas
and
yagorsha
half
dragged
half
pulled
him
into
the
kachime
the
entire
escort
followed
even
two
or
three
very
dirty
little
boys
everybody
except
the
handful
of
women
and
girls
left
at
the
mouth
of
the
underground
entrance
and
the
two
men
who
had
run
on
to
make
a
fire
it
was
already
smoking
viciously
as
though
the
were
doing
enough
in
that
line
when
yagorsha
and
nicholas
laid
the
traveller
on
the
the
pymeuts
knew
that
the
great
thing
was
to
get
the
clothes
off
as
quickly
as
might
be
and
that
is
to
be
done
expeditiously
only
by
cutting
them
off
in
vain
the
boy
protested
recklessly
they
sawed
and
cut
and
stripped
him
rubbed
him
and
wrapped
him
in
a
the
fur
turned
inside
and
a
wolverine
skin
over
that
the
colonel
at
intervals
poured
small
doses
of
whisky
down
the
boy
throat
in
spite
of
his
unbecoming
behaviour
for
he
was
both
belligerent
and
ungrateful
complaining
loudly
of
the
ruin
of
his
clothes
with
only
such
intermission
as
the
swallowing
and
rude
handling
necessitated
i
did
like
bein
in
that
do
you
know
it
was
so
cold
it
burnt
but
i
rather
be
in
a
than
is
so
as
these
you
better
be
glad
you
got
a
whole
skin
of
your
own
and
smellin
brimstone
said
the
colonel
pouring
a
little
more
whisky
down
the
unthankful
throat
pretty
sort
o
klondyker
you
are
go
and
get
nearly
drowned
first
day
out
several
pymeut
women
came
in
presently
and
joined
the
men
at
the
fire
chattering
low
and
staring
at
the
colonel
and
the
boy
i
ca
go
to
the
klondyke
naked
no
nor
wrapped
in
a
like
baby
bunting
nicholas
was
conferring
with
the
colonel
and
offering
to
take
him
to
ol
chief
oh
yes
ol
chief
got
two
you
come
me
show
and
they
crawled
out
one
after
the
other
you
pretty
near
dead
that
time
said
one
of
the
younger
women
conversationally
that
right
who
are
you
anyway
me
anna
yagorsha
daughter
oh
yes
i
thought
i
seen
you
before
she
seemed
to
be
only
a
little
older
than
muckluck
but
less
attractive
chiefly
on
account
of
her
fat
and
her
look
of
she
was
on
specially
bad
terms
with
a
buck
they
called
joe
and
they
seemed
to
pass
all
their
time
abusing
one
another
the
boy
craned
his
neck
and
looked
round
except
just
where
he
was
lying
the
pymeut
men
and
women
were
crowded
together
on
that
side
of
the
kachime
at
his
head
and
at
his
feet
thick
as
herrings
on
a
thwart
they
all
leaned
forward
and
regarded
him
with
a
sympathy
he
had
never
been
so
impressed
by
the
fact
before
but
all
these
native
people
even
in
their
gentlest
moods
frowned
in
a
chronic
perplexity
and
wore
their
wide
mouths
open
he
reflected
that
he
had
never
seen
one
that
did
except
muckluck
here
she
was
crawling
in
with
a
tin
can
got
something
there
to
eat
the
rescued
one
craned
his
head
as
far
as
he
could
too
soon
she
said
showing
her
brilliant
teeth
in
the
she
set
the
tin
down
looked
round
a
little
embarrassed
and
stirred
the
fire
which
did
need
it
well
he
put
his
chin
down
under
the
once
more
how
goes
the
world
princess
she
flashed
her
quick
smile
again
and
nodded
reassuringly
you
stay
here
now
no
goin
up
river
what
for
she
spoke
disapprovingly
want
to
get
an
orange
grove
find
him
up
river
hope
so
i
think
i
go
too
and
all
the
grave
folk
sitting
so
close
on
the
stretched
their
wide
mouths
wider
still
smiling
you
better
wait
till
summer
oh
she
lifted
her
head
from
the
fire
as
one
who
takes
careful
note
of
instructions
nex
summer
well
summer
the
time
for
squaws
to
travel
i
come
nex
summer
she
said
nicholas
returned
with
a
new
parki
and
a
pair
of
wonderful
buckskin
breeches
not
like
anything
worn
by
the
lower
river
natives
or
by
the
either
well
cut
well
made
and
handsomely
fringed
down
the
outside
of
the
leg
where
an
officer
gold
stripe
goes
chaparejos
screamed
the
boy
where
you
get
ol
chief
he
ketch
um
they
said
the
boy
holding
the
despised
under
his
chin
with
both
hands
and
craning
excitedly
over
it
he
felt
that
his
fortunes
were
looking
up
talk
about
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men
why
a
tide
that
washes
up
to
a
wayfarer
feet
a
pair
o
chaparejos
like
that
well
legs
so
habited
would
simply
to
carry
a
fella
on
to
fortune
he
lay
back
on
the
with
dancing
eyes
while
the
raw
whisky
hummed
in
his
head
in
the
dim
light
of
vague
visions
visited
him
of
stern
and
noble
chiefs
out
of
the
leather
stocking
stories
of
his
childhood
men
of
daring
whose
legs
were
invariably
cased
in
with
dangling
fringes
but
the
dashing
race
was
not
all
indian
nor
all
dead
famous
cowboys
reared
before
him
on
bucking
bronchos
their
streaming
on
the
blast
and
desperate
chaps
who
held
up
coaches
and
potted
wells
fargo
guards
anybody
must
needs
be
a
devil
of
a
fellow
who
went
about
in
shaps
as
his
california
cousins
called
chaparejos
even
a
peaceable
fella
like
himself
not
out
after
gore
at
all
but
after
an
orange
grove
even
he
once
he
put
on
he
laughed
out
loud
at
his
childishness
and
then
grew
grave
say
nicholas
what
the
tax
hey
how
much
oh
your
pardner
he
pay
humph
i
i
know
the
worst
on
then
after
a
few
moments
making
a
final
clutch
at
economy
before
the
warmth
and
the
whisky
subdued
him
altogether
say
nicholas
have
you
got
has
the
ol
chief
got
any
less
glorious
breeches
than
those
hey
anything
little
cheaper
nuh
says
nicholas
the
boy
closed
his
eyes
relieved
on
the
whole
fate
had
a
mind
to
see
him
in
chaparejos
let
her
look
to
the
sequel
then
when
consciousness
came
back
it
brought
the
sound
of
yagorsha
yarning
by
the
fire
and
the
occasional
laugh
or
grunt
punctuating
the
eternal
story
the
colonel
was
sitting
there
among
them
solacing
himself
by
adding
to
the
smoke
that
thickened
the
stifling
air
presently
the
made
some
shrewd
hit
that
shook
the
pymeut
community
into
louder
grunts
of
applause
and
a
general
chuckling
the
colonel
turned
his
head
slowly
and
blew
out
a
fresh
cloud
good
joke
in
the
pause
that
fell
thereafter
yagorsha
imperturbable
the
only
one
who
had
not
laughed
smoothed
his
lank
locks
down
on
either
side
of
his
wide
face
and
went
on
renewing
the
sinew
in
his
when
ol
chief
father
die
all
the
pymeuts
chuckled
afresh
the
boy
listened
eagerly
usually
yagorsha
stories
were
tragic
or
at
least
of
serious
interest
ranging
from
bereaved
parents
who
turned
into
wolverines
all
the
way
to
the
machinations
of
the
horrid
dwarf
and
the
cannibal
old
woman
the
colonel
looked
at
nicholas
he
seemed
as
entertained
as
the
rest
but
quite
willing
to
leave
his
family
history
in
professional
hands
ol
chief
father
glovotsky
him
russian
yagorsha
began
again
laying
down
his
a
moment
and
accepting
some
of
the
colonel
tobacco
i
did
know
you
had
any
white
blood
in
you
interrupted
the
colonel
offering
his
pouch
to
nicholas
i
might
have
suspected
muckluck
heap
got
russian
blood
interrupted
joe
as
the
seemed
to
be
about
to
repeat
the
enlivening
tradition
concerning
the
almost
mythical
youth
of
ol
chief
father
that
subject
of
the
great
katharine
whose
blood
was
flowing
still
in
pymeut
veins
just
then
in
came
yagorsha
daughter
with
some
message
to
her
father
he
grunted
acquiescence
and
she
turned
to
go
joe
called
something
after
her
and
she
snapped
back
he
jumped
up
to
bar
her
exit
she
gave
him
a
smart
cuff
across
the
eyes
which
surprised
him
almost
into
the
fire
and
while
he
was
recovering
his
equilibrium
she
fled
yagorsha
and
all
the
pymeuts
laughed
delightedly
at
discomfiture
the
boy
had
been
obliged
to
sit
up
to
watch
this
spirited
encounter
the
only
notice
the
colonel
took
of
him
was
to
set
the
kettle
on
the
fire
while
he
was
dining
his
pardner
gathered
up
the
blankets
and
crawled
out
comin
in
half
a
minute
the
boy
called
after
him
the
answer
was
swallowed
by
the
tunnel
him
go
say
ol
chief
said
nicholas
observing
how
the
colonel
pardner
was
scalding
himself
in
his
haste
to
despatch
a
second
cup
of
tea
but
the
boy
bolted
the
last
of
his
meal
gathered
up
the
kettle
mug
and
which
had
served
him
for
plate
as
well
and
wormed
his
way
out
as
fast
as
he
could
there
was
the
sled
nearly
packed
for
the
journey
and
watching
over
it
keeping
the
dogs
at
bay
was
an
indescribably
dirty
little
boy
in
a
torn
and
greasy
denim
parki
over
rags
of
nobody
else
in
sight
but
yagorsha
daughter
down
at
the
where
my
pardner
gone
the
child
only
stared
having
no
english
apparently
while
the
boy
packed
the
rest
of
the
things
and
made
the
tattered
canvas
fast
under
the
lashing
joe
came
out
of
the
kachime
he
stood
studying
the
prospect
a
moment
and
his
dull
eyes
suddenly
gleamed
anna
was
coming
up
from
the
river
with
her
dripping
pail
he
set
off
with
an
affectation
of
leisurely
indifference
but
he
made
straight
for
his
enemy
she
seemed
not
to
see
him
till
he
was
quite
near
then
she
sheered
off
sharply
joe
hardly
quickened
his
pace
but
seemed
to
gain
she
set
down
her
bucket
and
turned
back
towards
the
river
idiot
ejaculated
the
boy
she
could
have
reached
her
own
ighloo
the
dirty
child
grinned
and
tore
off
towards
the
river
to
watch
the
fun
anna
was
hidden
now
by
a
pile
of
driftwood
the
boy
ran
down
a
few
yards
to
bring
her
within
range
again
for
all
his
affectation
of
leisureliness
and
her
obvious
fluster
no
doubt
about
it
joe
was
gaining
on
her
she
dropped
her
hurried
walk
and
frankly
took
to
her
heels
joe
doing
the
same
but
as
she
was
nearly
as
fleet
of
foot
as
muckluck
in
spite
of
her
fat
she
still
kept
a
lessening
distance
between
herself
and
her
pursuer
the
ragged
child
had
climbed
upon
the
pile
of
and
stood
hunched
with
the
cold
his
shoulders
up
to
his
ears
his
hands
withdrawn
in
his
parki
sleeves
but
he
was
grinning
still
the
boy
a
little
concerned
as
to
possible
reprisals
upon
so
impudent
a
young
woman
had
gone
on
and
on
watching
the
race
down
to
the
river
and
even
across
the
ice
a
little
way
he
stood
still
an
instant
staring
as
joe
going
now
as
hard
as
he
could
caught
up
with
her
at
last
he
took
hold
of
the
daughter
of
the
yagorsha
and
fell
to
shaking
and
cuffing
her
the
boy
started
off
full
tilt
to
the
rescue
before
he
could
reach
them
joe
had
thrown
her
down
on
the
ice
she
half
got
up
but
her
enemy
advancing
upon
her
again
dealt
her
a
blow
that
made
her
howl
and
sent
her
flat
once
more
stop
that
you
hear
it
the
boy
called
out
but
joe
seemed
not
to
hear
anna
had
fallen
face
downward
on
the
ice
this
time
and
lay
there
as
if
stunned
her
enemy
caught
hold
of
her
pulled
her
up
and
dragged
her
along
in
spite
of
her
struggles
and
cries
let
her
alone
the
boy
shouted
he
was
nearly
up
to
them
now
but
joe
attention
was
wholly
occupied
in
hauling
anna
back
to
the
village
maltreating
her
at
intervals
by
the
way
now
the
girl
was
putting
up
one
arm
piteously
to
shield
her
bleeding
face
from
his
fists
do
you
hit
her
again
or
it
be
the
worse
for
you
but
again
joe
hand
was
lifted
the
boy
plunged
forward
caught
the
blow
as
it
descended
and
flung
the
arm
aside
wrenched
the
girl
free
and
as
joe
came
on
again
looking
as
if
he
meant
business
the
boy
planted
a
sounding
lick
on
his
jaw
the
pymeut
staggered
and
drew
off
a
little
way
looking
angry
enough
but
to
the
boy
surprise
showing
no
fight
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
girl
her
lip
bleeding
her
parki
torn
seemed
more
surprised
than
grateful
and
when
he
said
you
come
back
with
me
he
sha
touch
you
she
did
not
show
the
pleased
alacrity
that
you
would
expect
but
she
was
no
doubt
still
dazed
they
all
stood
looking
rather
sheepish
and
like
actors
stuck
who
can
not
think
of
the
next
line
till
joe
turned
on
the
girl
with
some
mumbled
question
she
answered
angrily
he
made
another
grab
at
her
she
screamed
and
got
behind
the
boy
very
resolutely
he
widened
his
bold
legs
and
dared
joe
to
touch
the
poor
frightened
creature
cowering
behind
her
protector
again
silence
what
the
trouble
between
you
two
they
looked
at
each
other
and
then
away
joe
turned
unexpectedly
and
shambled
off
in
the
direction
of
the
village
not
a
word
out
of
anna
as
she
returned
by
the
side
of
her
protector
but
every
now
and
then
she
looked
at
him
sideways
the
boy
felt
her
inexpressive
gratitude
and
was
glad
his
journey
had
been
delayed
or
else
poor
devil
joe
had
stopped
to
speak
to
who
on
earth
that
white
woman
nicholas
sister
not
muckluck
she
nodded
what
she
dressed
like
that
for
often
like
that
in
summer
me
too
me
got
holy
cross
muckluck
went
slowly
up
towards
the
kachime
with
joe
when
the
others
got
to
the
anna
turned
and
left
the
boy
without
a
word
to
go
and
recover
her
pail
the
boy
stood
a
moment
looking
for
some
sign
of
the
colonel
and
then
went
along
the
river
bank
to
ol
chief
no
the
colonel
had
gone
back
to
the
kachime
the
boy
came
out
again
and
to
his
almost
incredulous
astonishment
there
was
joe
dragging
the
unfortunate
anna
towards
an
ighloo
as
he
looked
back
to
steer
straight
for
the
he
caught
sight
of
the
boy
dropped
his
prey
and
disappeared
with
some
precipitancy
into
the
ground
when
anna
had
gathered
herself
up
the
boy
was
standing
in
front
of
her
you
do
seem
to
be
able
to
take
very
good
care
o
yourself
she
pushed
her
tousled
hair
out
of
her
eyes
i
do
wonder
your
own
people
give
it
up
if
you
have
to
be
rescued
every
what
the
matter
with
you
and
joe
she
kept
looking
down
what
have
you
done
to
make
him
like
this
she
looked
up
suddenly
and
laughed
and
then
her
eyes
fell
done
nothin
why
should
he
want
to
kill
you
then
no
she
said
smiling
a
little
rueful
and
embarrassed
again
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
then
as
the
boy
still
stood
there
waiting
joe
she
whispered
glancing
over
her
shoulder
joe
want
me
be
he
squaw
the
boy
fell
back
an
astonished
step
he
got
a
pretty
way
o
sayin
so
why
do
you
tell
your
father
tell
father
it
seemed
never
to
have
occurred
to
her
yes
ca
yagorsha
protect
you
she
looked
about
doubtfully
and
then
over
her
shoulder
that
joe
ighloo
she
said
he
pictured
to
himself
the
horror
that
must
assail
her
blood
at
the
sight
yes
he
was
glad
to
have
saved
any
woman
from
so
dreadful
a
fate
did
it
happen
often
and
did
nobody
interfere
muckluck
was
coming
down
from
the
direction
of
the
kachime
the
boy
went
to
meet
her
throwing
over
his
shoulder
you
better
stick
to
me
anna
as
long
as
i
here
i
do
know
i
sure
happen
to
you
when
i
gone
anna
followed
a
few
paces
and
then
sat
down
on
the
snow
to
pull
up
and
tie
her
disorganized
muckluck
was
standing
still
looking
at
the
boy
with
none
of
the
kindness
a
woman
ought
to
show
to
one
who
had
just
befriended
her
sex
did
you
see
that
she
nodded
see
that
any
day
the
boy
stopped
appalled
at
the
thought
of
woman
in
a
perpetual
state
of
siege
brute
hound
he
flung
out
towards
joe
ighloo
no
says
muckluck
firmly
joe
all
right
you
say
that
after
what
happened
this
morning
muckluck
declined
to
take
the
verdict
back
did
you
see
him
strike
her
no
oh
did
it
he
threw
her
down
as
hard
as
he
could
on
the
ice
she
get
up
again
he
despised
muckluck
in
that
moment
you
were
sorry
to
see
another
girl
treated
so
she
smiled
what
if
it
had
been
you
oh
he
not
do
that
to
why
not
you
ca
tell
oh
yes
she
spoke
with
unruffled
serenity
it
will
very
likely
be
you
the
next
time
the
boy
took
a
brutal
pleasure
in
presenting
the
hideous
probability
no
she
returned
unmoved
joe
savvy
i
no
marry
pymeut
the
boy
stared
mystified
by
the
lack
of
sequence
poor
anna
want
to
marry
pymeut
muckluck
nodded
the
boy
gave
her
up
perversity
was
not
confined
to
the
civilized
of
her
sex
he
walked
on
to
find
the
colonel
muckluck
followed
but
the
boy
would
speak
to
her
would
look
at
her
you
like
my
holy
cross
she
inquired
me
i
look
like
your
kind
of
girls
now
huh
no
answer
but
she
kept
up
with
him
see
she
held
up
proudly
a
medallion
or
coin
of
some
sort
hung
on
a
narrow
strip
of
he
meant
not
to
look
at
it
at
all
and
he
jerked
his
head
away
after
the
merest
glance
that
showed
him
the
ornament
was
tarnished
silver
a
little
bigger
than
an
american
dollar
and
bore
no
device
familiar
to
his
eyes
he
quickened
his
pace
and
walked
on
with
face
averted
the
colonel
appeared
just
below
the
kachime
well
are
you
comin
he
called
out
i
been
ready
this
hangin
about
waitin
for
you
that
devil
joe
he
went
on
lowering
his
voice
as
he
came
up
and
speaking
hurriedly
has
been
trying
to
drag
yagorsha
girl
into
his
ighloo
they
just
had
a
fight
out
yonder
on
the
ice
i
got
her
away
but
not
before
he
thrown
her
down
and
given
her
a
bloody
face
we
ought
to
tell
old
yagorsha
hey
muckluck
chuckled
the
boy
turned
on
her
angrily
and
saw
her
staring
back
at
joe
ighloo
there
sauntering
calmly
past
the
abhorred
trap
was
the
daughter
past
it
no
she
actually
halted
and
busied
herself
with
her
legging
thong
that
girl
must
be
an
imbecile
or
was
it
the
apparition
of
her
father
up
at
the
kachime
entrance
that
inspired
such
temerity
the
boy
had
gone
a
few
paces
towards
her
and
then
turned
yagorsha
he
called
up
the
slope
yagorsha
stood
although
the
boy
waved
unmistakable
towards
joe
ighloo
suddenly
an
arm
flashed
out
of
the
tunnel
caught
anna
by
the
ankle
and
in
a
twinkling
she
lay
sprawling
on
her
back
two
hands
shot
out
seized
her
by
the
heels
and
dragged
the
wretched
girl
into
the
brute
lair
it
was
all
over
in
a
flash
a
moment
paralysis
of
astonishment
and
the
involuntary
rush
forward
was
arrested
by
muckluck
who
fastened
herself
on
to
the
rescuer
and
refused
to
be
detached
yagorsha
shouted
the
boy
but
it
was
only
the
colonel
who
hastened
towards
them
at
the
summons
the
poor
girl
own
father
stood
calmly
smoking
up
there
by
the
kachime
one
foot
propped
comfortably
on
the
loaded
sled
yagorsha
he
shouted
again
and
then
with
a
jerk
to
free
himself
from
muckluck
the
boy
turned
sharply
towards
the
ighloo
seeming
in
a
bewildered
way
to
be
himself
about
to
transact
this
paternal
business
for
the
cowardly
old
loafer
but
muckluck
clung
to
his
arm
laughing
yagorsha
know
joe
give
him
nice
mitts
sealskin
mitts
hear
that
colonel
for
a
pair
of
mitts
he
sells
his
daughter
to
that
ruffian
without
definite
plan
quite
vaguely
and
instinctively
he
shook
himself
free
from
muckluck
and
rushed
down
to
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
muffled
screams
and
yells
issued
with
the
smoke
muckluck
turned
sharply
to
the
colonel
who
was
following
and
said
something
that
sent
him
headlong
after
the
boy
he
seized
the
doughty
champion
by
the
feet
just
as
he
was
disappearing
in
the
tunnel
and
hauled
him
out
what
in
thunder
all
right
you
go
first
then
as
more
screams
rent
the
still
air
do
be
a
fool
you
been
interruptin
the
weddin
ceremonies
muckluck
had
caught
up
with
them
and
yagorsha
was
advancing
leisurely
across
the
snow
she
no
want
whispered
muckluck
to
the
boy
she
joe
like
him
best
of
all
then
as
the
boy
gaped
incredulously
she
tell
me
heap
long
time
ago
she
want
joe
that
just
part
of
the
weddin
festivity
says
the
colonel
as
renewed
shrieks
issued
from
under
the
snow
you
been
an
officious
interferer
and
i
think
the
sooner
i
get
you
out
o
pymeut
the
healthier
it
be
for
you
the
boy
was
too
flabbergasted
to
reply
but
he
was
far
from
convinced
the
colonel
turned
back
to
apologise
to
yagorsha
no
like
this
in
your
country
inquired
muckluck
of
the
crestfallen
champion
not
exactly
when
you
like
girl
what
you
do
tell
her
so
muttered
the
boy
mechanically
well
joe
been
tellin
anna
all
winter
and
she
hated
him
no
she
like
joe
best
of
any
what
did
she
go
on
like
that
for
then
she
know
joe
savvy
the
boy
felt
painfully
small
at
his
own
lack
of
but
no
less
angry
when
you
marry
he
turned
to
her
incredulously
will
it
be
again
the
shrieks
like
this
i
no
marry
pymeut
glancing
riverwards
he
saw
the
dirty
imp
who
had
been
so
wildly
entertained
by
the
encounter
on
the
ice
still
huddled
on
his
observatory
presenting
as
little
surface
to
the
cold
as
possible
but
grinning
still
with
rapture
at
the
spirited
last
act
of
the
drama
as
the
boy
with
an
exclamation
of
well
i
give
it
up
walked
slowly
across
the
slope
after
the
colonel
and
yagorsha
muckluck
lingered
at
his
side
in
your
country
when
girl
marry
she
no
scream
well
no
not
usually
i
believe
she
go
quiet
like
like
she
muckluck
stood
still
with
astonishment
and
outraged
modesty
they
agree
he
answered
irritably
they
do
go
on
like
wild
beasts
muckluck
pondered
deeply
this
matter
of
supreme
importance
when
you
get
you
squaw
you
no
her
come
the
boy
shook
his
head
and
turned
away
to
cut
short
these
excursions
into
comparative
ethnology
but
muckluck
was
athirst
for
the
strange
new
knowledge
what
you
do
he
declined
to
betray
his
plan
of
action
when
you
all
same
joe
hey
still
no
answer
when
you
girl
like
you
best
you
no
drag
her
home
no
be
quiet
no
how
you
marry
you
self
then
the
conversation
would
be
still
more
embarrassing
before
the
colonel
so
he
stopped
and
said
shortly
in
our
country
nobody
beats
a
woman
because
he
likes
her
how
she
know
then
they
i
tell
you
oh
an
girl
just
come
when
he
call
she
dropped
her
jaw
and
stared
no
fight
a
she
gasped
no
scream
quite
i
tell
you
he
ran
on
and
joined
the
colonel
muckluck
stood
several
moments
rooted
in
amazement
yagorsha
had
called
the
rest
of
the
pymeuts
out
for
these
queer
guests
of
theirs
were
evidently
going
at
last
they
all
said
with
great
goodwill
only
muckluck
in
her
chilly
holy
cross
stood
sorrowful
and
silent
swinging
her
medal
slowly
back
and
forth
nicholas
warned
them
that
the
pymeut
was
not
the
only
one
no
yagorsha
called
down
the
slope
better
no
play
tricks
with
he
nodded
towards
the
river
as
the
travellers
looked
back
him
no
like
him
got
heap
plenty
mouths
chew
you
up
and
all
pymeut
chuckled
delighted
at
their
wit
suddenly
muckluck
broke
away
from
the
group
and
ran
briskly
down
to
the
river
trail
i
will
pray
for
you
hard
she
caught
hold
of
the
boy
hand
and
shook
it
warmly
sister
winifred
says
the
good
father
fact
is
muckluck
answered
the
boy
disengaging
himself
with
embarrassment
my
pardner
here
can
hold
up
that
end
do
you
think
you
better
square
yukon
inua
do
he
likes
me
and
they
left
her
shivering
in
her
holy
cross
staring
after
them
and
sadly
swinging
her
medal
on
its
i
do
mind
sayin
i
glad
to
leave
pymeut
behind
said
the
colonel
same
here
you
safe
to
get
into
a
muss
if
you
mix
up
with
anything
that
has
to
do
with
women
that
muckluck
o
yours
is
a
minx
she
ai
my
muckluck
and
i
do
believe
she
a
minx
not
a
little
bit
not
wishing
to
be
too
hard
on
his
pardner
the
colonel
added
i
lay
it
all
to
the
chaparejos
myself
then
observing
his
marked
absence
of
hilarity
you
very
gay
in
your
fine
fringes
been
a
little
too
gay
the
last
two
or
three
hours
well
now
i
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
i
think
myself
we
had
adventures
enough
right
here
at
the
start
i
you
but
there
something
in
that
idea
o
yours
other
fellas
have
noticed
the
same
tendency
in
chaparejos
well
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
drawled
the
colonel
change
breeches
the
suggestion
roused
no
enthusiasm
i
have
a
cammin
influence
yes
sir
i
reckon
i
could
keep
those
fringes
out
o
kinks
oh
i
think
they
go
straight
enough
after
this
and
the
boy
good
spirits
returned
before
they
passed
the
summer
village
it
came
on
to
snow
again
about
six
that
second
day
out
and
continued
steadily
all
the
night
what
did
it
matter
they
were
used
to
snow
and
they
were
as
jolly
as
clams
at
the
colonel
called
a
halt
in
the
shelter
of
a
frozen
slough
between
two
banks
sparsely
timbered
but
promising
all
the
wood
they
needed
old
as
well
as
new
he
made
his
camp
fire
on
the
snow
and
the
boy
soon
had
the
ready
always
the
first
course
so
long
as
liebig
lasted
thereafter
while
the
bacon
was
frying
and
the
tea
brewing
the
colonel
stuck
up
in
the
snow
behind
the
fire
some
sticks
on
which
to
dry
their
when
he
pulled
off
his
mucklucks
his
stockinged
feet
smoked
in
the
frosty
air
the
hint
was
all
that
was
needed
that
first
night
on
the
trail
for
the
boy
to
follow
suit
and
make
the
change
into
dry
things
the
smoky
background
was
presently
ornamented
with
german
socks
and
arctic
socks
a
kind
of
felt
slipper
and
mucklucks
each
with
a
stick
run
through
them
to
the
toe
all
neatly
planted
in
a
row
like
monstrous
products
of
a
with
dry
feet
burning
faces
and
chilly
backs
they
hugged
the
fire
ate
supper
laughed
and
talked
and
said
that
life
on
the
trail
was
half
bad
afterwards
they
rolled
themselves
in
their
blankets
and
went
to
sleep
on
their
spring
mattresses
spread
near
the
fire
on
the
snow
after
about
half
an
hour
of
oblivion
the
boy
started
up
with
the
drowsy
impression
that
a
flying
spark
from
the
dying
fire
had
set
their
stuff
ablaze
no
but
surely
the
fire
had
been
made
up
again
and
he
rubbed
the
sleep
out
of
his
incredulous
eyes
yes
muckluck
was
standing
there
what
in
thunder
he
began
is
it
it
is
me
i
can
see
that
much
but
what
brings
you
here
shivering
with
cold
she
crouched
close
to
the
fire
dressed
as
he
could
see
now
in
her
native
clothes
again
and
it
was
her
parki
that
had
scorched
was
scorching
still
me
i
smiling
she
drew
a
stiff
hand
out
of
its
mitten
and
held
it
over
the
reviving
blaze
glancing
towards
the
colonel
he
seemed
to
be
sleeping
very
sound
powdered
over
already
with
soft
wet
snow
but
she
whispered
her
next
remark
i
think
i
come
help
you
find
that
onge
grove
i
think
you
do
nothing
of
the
kind
he
also
spoke
with
a
deliberate
lowering
of
the
note
his
great
desire
not
to
wake
the
colonel
gave
an
unintentional
softness
to
his
tone
you
think
winter
bad
time
for
squaws
to
travel
she
shook
her
head
and
showed
her
beautiful
teeth
an
instant
in
the
faint
light
then
rising
half
shy
but
very
firm
i
no
wait
till
summer
he
was
so
appalled
for
the
moment
at
the
thought
of
having
her
on
their
hands
all
this
way
from
pymeut
on
a
snowy
night
that
words
failed
him
as
she
watched
him
she
too
grew
grave
you
say
me
nice
girl
when
did
i
say
that
he
clutched
his
head
in
despair
when
you
first
come
when
sham√°n
make
ol
chief
all
well
i
do
remember
it
yes
i
think
you
misunderstood
me
muckluck
heh
her
countenance
fell
but
more
puzzled
than
wounded
that
is
oh
yes
of
course
you
a
nice
girl
i
think
anna
too
you
like
me
best
she
helped
out
the
white
bashfulness
but
as
her
interlocutor
appalled
laid
no
claim
to
the
sentiment
she
lifted
the
mittened
hand
to
her
eyes
and
from
under
it
scanned
the
white
face
through
the
lightly
falling
snow
the
other
hand
still
held
out
to
the
comfort
of
the
smoke
was
trembling
a
little
perhaps
not
altogether
with
the
cold
the
colonel
have
to
take
over
the
breeches
said
the
boy
with
the
air
of
one
wandering
in
his
head
then
desperately
what
i
to
do
what
am
i
to
say
you
say
you
no
like
girl
scream
no
like
her
fight
like
anna
heh
so
me
i
come
like
your
girls
quite
quite
good
heh
you
do
understand
muckluck
i
you
see
i
could
never
find
that
orange
grove
if
you
came
along
why
well
a
no
woman
ever
goes
to
help
to
find
an
orange
grove
a
law
against
it
heh
law
alas
she
knew
too
little
to
be
impressed
by
the
majesty
invoked
you
see
women
they
they
come
when
the
orange
all
all
ready
for
no
man
takes
a
woman
on
that
kind
of
hunt
her
saddened
face
was
very
grave
the
boy
took
heart
now
the
pymeuts
are
going
in
a
week
or
two
nicholas
said
to
hunt
caribou
in
the
hills
yes
but
they
wo
take
you
to
hunt
caribou
no
they
leave
you
at
home
it
exactly
the
same
with
orange
groves
no
nice
girl
goes
hunting
her
lip
trembled
me
i
can
fish
course
you
can
his
spirits
were
reviving
you
can
do
anything
except
hunt
as
she
lifted
her
head
with
an
air
of
sudden
protest
he
quashed
her
from
the
beginning
there
been
a
law
against
that
squaws
must
stay
at
home
and
let
the
men
do
the
huntin
me
i
can
cook
she
was
crying
now
while
you
hunt
good
supper
all
ready
when
you
come
home
he
shook
his
head
solemnly
perhaps
you
do
know
she
flashed
a
moment
hope
through
her
tears
me
learn
sew
up
at
holy
cross
sew
up
your
socks
for
you
when
they
open
their
mouths
but
she
could
see
that
not
even
this
grand
new
accomplishment
availed
can
help
pull
sled
she
suggested
looking
round
a
little
wildly
as
if
instantly
to
illustrate
never
tired
she
added
sobbing
and
putting
her
hands
up
to
her
face
sh
sh
do
wake
the
colonel
he
got
up
hastily
and
stood
beside
her
at
the
smouldering
fire
he
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
of
course
you
a
nice
girl
the
nicest
girl
in
the
yukon
he
caught
himself
up
as
she
dropped
her
hands
from
her
face
that
is
you
will
be
if
you
go
home
quietly
again
she
hid
her
eyes
go
home
how
could
he
send
her
home
all
that
way
at
this
time
of
night
it
was
a
bothering
business
again
her
hands
fell
from
the
wet
unhappy
face
she
shivered
a
little
when
she
met
his
frowning
looks
and
turned
away
he
stooped
and
picked
up
her
mitten
why
you
could
turn
a
dog
away
on
a
night
like
this
plague
take
the
pymeuts
root
and
branch
she
had
shuffled
her
feet
into
her
straps
and
moved
off
in
the
dimness
but
for
the
sound
of
sobbing
he
could
not
have
told
just
where
in
the
snow
muckluck
figure
was
fading
into
the
dusk
he
hurried
after
her
but
most
unwilling
look
here
he
said
when
he
had
caught
up
with
her
i
sorry
you
came
all
this
way
in
the
cold
very
sorry
her
sobs
burst
out
afresh
and
louder
now
away
from
the
colonel
restraining
presence
but
see
here
i
ca
send
you
off
like
this
you
might
die
on
the
trail
yes
i
think
me
die
she
agreed
no
do
do
that
come
back
and
we
tell
the
colonel
you
going
to
stay
by
the
fire
till
morning
and
then
go
home
she
walked
steadily
on
no
i
go
now
but
you
ca
muckluck
you
ca
find
the
trail
i
tell
you
before
i
not
like
your
girls
i
can
go
in
winter
as
good
as
summer
i
hunt
she
turned
on
him
fiercely
once
i
hunt
a
owel
ketch
him
too
she
sniffed
back
her
tears
i
can
do
all
kinds
no
you
ca
hunt
orange
groves
he
said
with
a
severity
that
might
seem
excessive
but
i
ca
let
you
go
off
in
this
snowstorm
he
soon
stop
never
word
of
sweeter
import
in
his
ears
than
that
but
he
was
far
from
satisfied
with
his
conduct
all
the
same
it
was
quite
possible
that
the
pymeuts
discovering
her
absence
would
think
he
had
lured
her
away
and
there
might
be
complications
so
it
was
with
small
fervour
that
he
said
muckluck
i
wish
you
come
back
and
wait
till
morning
no
i
go
now
she
was
in
the
act
of
darting
forward
on
those
that
she
used
so
skillfully
when
some
sudden
thought
cried
halt
she
even
stopped
crying
i
no
like
go
near
by
night
i
keep
to
trail
but
how
the
devil
do
you
do
it
she
paid
no
heed
to
the
interruption
seeming
busy
in
taking
something
over
her
head
from
round
her
neck
she
said
lowering
her
voice
you
find
you
give
this
to
yukon
inua
say
i
send
it
he
will
not
hate
you
any
more
she
burst
into
a
fresh
flood
of
tears
in
a
moment
the
dim
sight
of
her
the
faint
trail
of
crying
left
in
her
wake
had
so
wholly
vanished
that
but
for
the
bit
of
string
as
it
seemed
to
be
left
in
his
hands
he
could
almost
have
convinced
himself
he
had
dreamt
the
unwelcome
visit
the
eye
of
the
camp
fire
gleamed
cheerfully
as
he
ran
back
and
crouched
down
where
poor
little
muckluck
had
knelt
so
sure
of
a
welcome
muckluck
cogitated
the
boy
will
believe
more
firmly
than
ever
that
if
a
man
does
beat
a
girl
he
does
mean
business
what
was
it
he
had
wound
round
one
hand
what
was
it
dangling
in
the
acrid
smoke
then
her
trinket
the
crowning
ornament
of
her
holy
cross
holiday
attire
that
was
what
she
was
offering
the
old
ogre
of
the
yukon
for
his
unworthy
sake
he
stirred
up
the
dying
fire
to
see
it
better
a
woman
face
some
catholic
saint
he
held
the
medal
lower
to
catch
the
fitful
blaze
autocratrix
the
great
katharine
only
a
little
crown
on
her
hair
and
her
splendid
chest
all
uncovered
to
the
arctic
cold
her
yukon
subjects
must
have
wondered
that
she
wore
no
parki
this
lady
who
had
claimed
sole
right
to
all
the
finest
sables
found
in
her
new
american
dominions
on
the
other
side
of
the
medal
minerva
with
a
shield
and
a
beautiful
harpoon
as
it
looked
with
a
and
all
complete
but
she
too
would
strike
the
yukon
eye
as
lamentably
chilly
about
the
legs
how
had
these
ladies
out
of
russia
and
olympus
come
to
lodge
in
ol
chief
ighloo
had
glovotsky
won
this
guerdon
at
great
katharine
hands
had
he
brought
it
on
that
last
long
journey
of
his
to
russian
america
and
left
it
to
his
pymeut
children
with
his
bones
well
yukon
inua
should
not
have
it
yet
the
boy
thrust
the
medal
into
a
pocket
of
his
chaparejos
and
crawled
into
his
bed
chapter
xi
holy
cross
raise
the
stone
and
ye
shall
find
me
cleave
the
wood
and
there
am
i
the
stars
were
shining
frostily
in
a
clear
sky
when
the
boy
crawled
out
from
under
his
in
the
morning
he
built
up
the
fire
quaking
in
the
bitter
air
and
bustled
the
breakfast
you
seem
to
be
in
something
of
a
hurry
said
the
colonel
with
a
yawn
stifled
in
a
shiver
we
have
come
on
this
trip
to
lie
abed
in
the
morning
his
pardner
returned
with
some
solemnity
i
do
care
how
soon
i
begin
ahead
with
that
load
again
well
it
be
warmin
anyway
returned
the
colonel
and
i
say
as
much
for
your
fire
it
was
luck
that
the
first
forty
miles
of
the
trail
had
already
been
traversed
by
the
boy
he
kept
recognising
this
and
that
in
the
landscape
with
an
effect
of
good
cheer
on
both
of
them
it
postponed
a
little
the
realization
of
their
daring
in
launching
themselves
upon
the
arctic
waste
without
a
guide
or
even
a
map
that
was
of
the
smallest
use
half
an
hour
after
setting
off
they
struck
into
the
portage
even
with
a
trail
the
boy
vivid
remembrance
of
the
other
journey
gave
them
the
sustaining
sense
that
they
were
going
right
the
colonel
was
working
off
the
surprising
stiffness
with
which
he
had
wakened
and
they
were
both
warm
now
but
the
colonel
footsoreness
was
considerable
an
affliction
besides
bound
to
be
worse
before
it
was
better
the
boy
spoke
with
the
superiority
of
his
own
experience
and
was
so
puffed
up
at
the
bare
thought
of
having
hardened
his
feet
that
he
concealed
without
a
qualm
the
fact
of
a
blister
on
his
heel
a
mere
nothing
that
not
worth
mentioning
to
anyone
who
remembered
the
state
he
was
in
at
the
end
of
that
awful
journey
of
penitence
it
was
well
on
in
the
afternoon
before
it
began
to
snow
again
and
they
had
reached
the
frozen
lake
the
days
were
lengthening
and
they
still
had
good
light
by
which
to
find
the
trail
on
the
other
side
now
in
a
minute
we
hear
the
mission
dogs
what
did
i
tell
you
out
of
the
little
wood
a
couple
of
teams
were
coming
at
a
good
round
pace
they
were
pulled
up
at
the
waterhole
and
the
mission
natives
ran
on
to
meet
the
new
arrivals
they
recognised
the
boy
and
insisted
on
making
the
colonel
who
was
walking
very
lame
ride
to
the
mission
in
the
strongest
sled
and
they
took
turns
helping
the
dogs
by
pushing
from
behind
the
snow
was
falling
heavily
again
and
one
of
the
indians
henry
looking
up
with
squinted
eyes
said
there
be
nothing
left
of
that
hey
inquired
the
boy
straining
at
his
and
bending
before
the
blast
what
that
do
you
know
what
makes
snow
said
henry
no
what
does
ivory
whittlings
when
they
get
to
their
carving
up
yonder
then
we
have
snow
what
was
happening
to
the
colonel
the
mere
physical
comfort
of
riding
instead
of
serving
as
packhorse
great
as
it
was
not
even
that
could
so
instantly
spirit
away
the
weariness
and
light
up
the
curious
solemn
radiance
that
shone
on
the
colonel
face
it
struck
the
boy
that
good
old
kentucky
would
look
like
that
when
he
met
his
dearest
at
the
gate
of
heaven
if
there
was
such
a
place
the
colonel
was
aware
of
the
sidelong
wonder
of
his
comrade
glance
for
the
sleds
abreast
had
come
to
a
momentary
halt
but
still
he
stared
in
front
of
him
just
as
a
sailor
in
a
storm
dares
not
look
away
from
the
an
instant
knowing
all
the
waste
about
him
abounds
in
rocks
and
eddies
and
in
death
and
all
the
world
of
hope
and
safe
returning
is
narrowed
to
that
little
point
of
light
after
the
moment
speculation
the
boy
turned
his
eyes
to
follow
the
colonel
gaze
into
space
the
cross
the
cross
said
the
man
on
the
sled
do
you
see
it
oh
that
yes
at
the
boy
tone
the
colonel
for
the
first
time
turned
his
eyes
away
from
the
great
white
symbol
do
know
what
you
made
of
if
seeing
that
you
need
be
a
church
member
but
only
a
man
i
should
think
to
to
he
blew
out
his
breath
in
impotent
clouds
and
then
went
on
we
americans
think
a
good
deal
o
the
stars
and
stripes
but
that
up
yonder
that
the
mightier
symbol
huh
says
the
boy
stars
and
stripes
tell
of
an
ideal
of
united
states
that
up
there
tells
of
an
ideal
of
united
mankind
it
the
great
brotherhood
mark
there
is
any
other
standard
that
men
would
follow
just
to
build
a
hospice
in
a
place
like
this
at
an
upper
window
in
a
building
on
the
far
side
of
the
white
symbol
the
travellers
caught
a
glimpse
through
the
slanting
snow
of
one
of
the
sisters
of
ann
shutting
in
the
bright
light
with
thick
curtains
glass
ejaculated
the
colonel
one
of
the
indians
had
run
on
to
announce
them
and
as
they
drew
up
at
the
door
that
the
boy
remembered
as
a
frame
for
brother
paul
with
his
lamp
to
search
out
iniquity
and
his
face
of
denunciation
out
came
father
brachet
brisk
almost
running
his
two
hands
outstretched
his
face
a
network
of
welcoming
wrinkles
no
long
waiting
this
time
in
the
straight
upstairs
to
hot
baths
and
mild
reviving
drinks
and
then
refreshed
and
already
rested
down
to
supper
with
a
shade
of
anxiety
the
boy
looked
about
for
brother
paul
but
father
wills
was
here
anyhow
and
the
boy
greeted
him
joyfully
as
a
tried
friend
and
a
man
to
be
depended
on
there
was
brother
etienne
and
there
were
two
strange
faces
father
brachet
put
the
colonel
on
his
right
and
the
boy
on
his
left
introducing
fazzer
richmond
my
predecessor
as
ze
head
of
all
ze
alaskan
missions
calmly
eliminating
greek
episcopalian
and
other
heretic
establishments
fazzer
richmond
you
must
have
heard
much
of
he
is
ze
great
ausority
up
here
he
is
now
ze
travelling
priest
you
can
ask
him
all
he
knows
everysing
in
no
wise
abashed
by
this
flourish
father
richmond
shook
hands
with
the
big
chimney
men
smiling
and
with
a
pleasant
ease
that
communicated
itself
to
the
entire
company
it
was
instantly
manifest
that
the
scene
of
this
jesuit
labours
had
not
been
chiefly
or
long
beyond
the
borders
of
civilization
in
the
plain
bare
room
where
for
all
its
hospitality
and
good
cheer
reigned
an
air
of
rude
simplicity
and
austerity
of
life
into
this
somewhat
rarefied
atmosphere
father
richmond
brought
a
whiff
from
another
world
as
he
greeted
the
two
strangers
and
said
simply
that
he
had
just
arrived
himself
by
way
of
the
anvik
portage
the
colonel
felt
that
he
must
have
meant
from
new
york
or
from
paris
instead
of
the
words
he
added
from
st
michael
he
claimed
instant
kinship
with
the
colonel
on
the
strength
of
their
both
being
southerners
i
a
baltimore
man
he
said
with
an
accent
no
marylander
can
purge
of
pride
how
long
since
you
been
home
oh
i
go
back
every
year
he
goes
all
over
ze
world
to
tell
ze
people
something
of
the
work
being
done
here
by
father
brachet
and
all
of
them
he
included
the
other
priests
and
in
a
slight
circular
movement
of
the
grizzled
head
and
to
collect
funds
the
colonel
rightly
divined
little
guessing
how
triumphantly
he
achieved
that
end
alaska
is
so
remote
said
the
travelling
priest
as
if
in
apology
for
popular
ignorance
and
people
think
of
it
so
inadequately
shall
we
say
in
trying
to
explain
the
conditions
up
here
i
have
my
chief
difficulty
in
making
them
realise
the
great
distances
we
have
to
cover
you
tell
them
that
in
the
indian
tongue
alaska
means
the
great
country
they
smile
and
think
condescendingly
of
savage
imagery
it
is
vain
to
say
we
have
an
area
of
six
hundred
thousand
square
miles
we
talk
much
in
these
days
of
education
but
few
men
and
no
women
can
count
our
eastern
friends
get
some
idea
of
what
we
mean
when
we
tell
them
alaska
is
bigger
than
all
the
atlantic
states
from
maine
to
louisiana
with
half
of
great
texas
thrown
in
with
a
of
twenty
six
thousand
miles
this
alaska
of
ours
turns
to
the
sea
a
greater
frontage
than
all
the
shores
of
all
the
united
states
combined
it
extends
so
far
out
towards
asia
that
it
carries
the
dominions
of
the
great
republic
as
far
west
of
san
francisco
as
new
york
is
east
of
it
making
california
a
central
state
i
try
to
give
europeans
some
idea
of
it
by
saying
that
if
you
add
england
ireland
and
scotland
together
and
to
that
add
france
and
to
that
add
italy
you
still
lack
enough
to
make
a
country
the
size
of
alaska
i
do
not
speak
of
our
mountains
seventeen
eighteen
nineteen
thousand
feet
high
and
our
yukon
flowing
for
more
than
two
thousand
miles
through
a
country
almost
virgin
still
you
travel
about
up
here
a
good
deal
he
travels
ze
time
he
will
not
rest
said
father
brachet
as
one
airing
an
ancient
grievance
yes
i
will
rest
now
a
little
i
have
been
eight
hundred
miles
over
the
ice
with
dogs
since
january
the
boy
looked
at
him
with
something
very
like
reverence
here
was
a
man
who
could
give
you
tips
you
have
travelled
abroad
too
the
colonel
rather
stated
than
asked
i
spent
a
good
deal
of
my
youth
in
france
and
germany
educated
over
there
well
i
am
a
johns
hopkins
man
but
i
may
say
i
found
my
education
in
rome
speaking
of
education
he
turned
to
the
other
priests
i
have
greatly
advanced
my
grammar
since
we
parted
father
brachet
answered
with
animation
in
french
and
the
conversation
went
forward
for
some
minutes
in
that
tongue
the
discussion
was
interrupted
to
introduce
the
other
new
face
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
to
the
big
chimney
men
resident
fazzer
roget
of
ze
kuskoquim
mission
that
is
the
best
man
on
in
central
alaska
said
father
richmond
low
to
the
colonel
nodding
at
the
kuskoquim
priest
and
he
knows
more
of
two
of
ze
native
dialects
here
zan
anyone
else
added
the
father
superior
you
must
forgive
our
speaking
much
of
the
indian
tongues
said
father
richmond
we
are
all
making
dictionaries
and
grammars
we
have
still
to
translate
much
of
our
religious
instruction
and
the
great
variety
in
dialect
of
the
scattered
tribes
keeps
us
busy
with
linguistic
studies
tomorrow
you
must
see
our
schools
said
father
brachet
but
the
boy
answered
quickly
that
they
could
not
afford
the
time
he
was
surprised
at
the
colonel
silence
but
the
boy
did
know
what
the
colonel
feet
felt
like
kentucky
ai
sorry
he
said
to
himself
to
have
a
back
to
his
chair
and
to
eat
off
china
again
kentucky
a
voluptuary
i
have
to
drag
him
away
by
main
force
and
the
boy
allowed
father
richmond
to
help
him
yet
more
abundantly
to
the
potatoes
and
cabbage
grown
last
summer
in
the
mission
garden
it
was
especially
the
vegetables
that
lent
an
element
of
luxury
to
the
simple
meal
the
warm
room
the
excellent
food
better
cooked
than
any
they
had
had
for
seven
months
produced
a
gentle
somnolence
the
thought
of
the
inviting
look
of
the
bed
upstairs
lay
like
a
balm
on
the
spirits
of
men
not
born
to
roughing
it
as
the
travellers
said
an
early
and
grateful
the
boy
added
sleepily
something
about
the
start
at
dawn
father
brachet
answered
morning
will
bring
counsel
my
son
i
sink
ze
will
not
let
us
lose
you
so
soon
they
overslept
themselves
and
they
knew
it
in
that
way
the
early
riser
does
before
ever
he
looks
into
the
accusing
face
of
his
watch
the
boy
leapt
out
of
bed
hear
that
the
wind
was
booming
among
the
settlement
buildings
sounds
as
if
there
was
weather
outside
a
glance
between
the
curtains
showed
the
great
gale
at
its
height
the
snow
blew
level
in
sheets
and
darkened
the
air
well
said
the
colonel
splashing
mightily
in
the
water
i
do
know
as
i
mind
giving
my
feet
hours
time
to
come
to
their
senses
a
hurried
toilet
and
they
went
downstairs
for
breakfast
after
the
long
refreshing
sleep
father
richmond
was
writing
on
his
knee
by
the
stove
in
the
he
rang
the
bell
well
what
did
we
tell
you
i
do
think
you
get
far
today
let
these
gentlemen
know
when
breakfast
is
ready
he
said
as
christopher
put
his
head
in
he
looked
at
his
watch
i
hope
you
will
find
everything
you
need
he
said
and
continuing
to
talk
about
the
gale
and
some
damage
it
had
done
to
one
of
the
outbuildings
he
went
into
the
entry
just
beyond
the
door
and
began
to
put
on
his
furs
not
going
out
in
such
weather
the
colonel
called
after
him
incredulously
only
as
far
as
the
church
oh
is
there
church
today
inquired
the
boy
more
cheerfully
than
one
might
expect
the
colonel
started
and
made
a
signal
for
discretion
blest
if
it
is
sunday
he
said
under
his
breath
he
does
seem
on
our
observing
it
whispered
the
boy
the
colonel
warmed
himself
luxuriously
at
the
stove
and
seemed
to
listen
for
that
summons
from
the
entry
that
never
came
was
father
richmond
out
there
still
or
had
he
gone
do
they
think
we
are
heathens
because
we
are
not
jesuits
he
said
under
his
breath
suddenly
throwing
out
his
great
chest
perhaps
we
ought
to
hey
they
been
awfully
considerate
of
the
colonel
went
to
the
door
father
richmond
was
struggling
with
his
with
your
permission
sir
says
the
colonel
in
his
most
magnificent
manner
we
will
accompany
you
or
follow
if
you
are
in
haste
with
all
my
heart
come
said
the
priest
if
you
will
wait
and
breakfast
with
us
after
mass
it
was
agreed
and
the
immediate
order
was
countermanded
the
sound
of
a
bell
came
muffled
through
the
storm
with
thoughts
turning
reluctantly
from
breakfast
what
that
asked
the
boy
that
is
our
church
bell
the
father
had
helped
the
colonel
to
find
his
parki
oh
a
of
course
a
fine
tone
do
you
think
but
you
ca
tell
so
well
in
this
storm
we
are
fond
of
our
bell
it
is
the
first
that
ever
rang
out
in
the
yukon
valley
listen
they
stood
still
a
moment
before
opening
the
front
door
the
boy
seeing
the
very
look
of
a
certain
gray
stone
andrew
far
away
and
himself
trotting
along
beside
that
figure
inseparable
from
first
memories
was
dimly
aware
again
as
he
stood
at
the
jesuit
door
in
these
different
days
of
the
old
sunday
feeling
invading
permeating
his
consciousness
half
reluctant
half
amused
the
colonel
sat
in
a
rural
church
and
looked
at
the
averted
face
of
a
woman
only
to
the
priest
was
the
sound
all
music
that
language
he
said
speaks
to
men
whatever
tongue
they
call
their
own
the
natives
hear
it
for
miles
up
the
river
and
down
the
river
and
over
the
white
hills
and
far
across
the
tundra
they
come
many
miles
to
mass
he
opened
the
door
and
the
gale
rushed
in
i
do
not
mean
on
days
like
this
he
wound
up
smiling
and
out
they
went
into
the
whirling
snow
the
church
was
a
building
of
logs
like
the
others
except
that
it
was
of
one
story
father
brachet
was
already
there
with
father
wills
and
brother
etienne
and
after
a
moment
in
came
brother
paul
looking
more
waxen
and
aloof
than
ever
at
the
head
of
the
school
the
rear
brought
up
by
brother
vincent
and
henry
in
a
moment
the
little
mother
superior
appeared
followed
by
two
nuns
heading
a
procession
of
native
women
and
girls
they
took
their
places
on
the
other
side
of
the
church
and
bowed
their
heads
beautiful
creature
ejaculated
the
colonel
under
his
breath
glancing
back
his
companion
turned
his
head
sharply
just
in
time
to
see
sister
winifred
come
last
into
the
church
holding
by
either
hand
a
little
child
both
men
watched
her
as
she
knelt
down
between
the
sallow
squinting
little
visages
the
calm
unconscious
face
of
the
nun
shone
white
like
a
flower
the
strangers
glanced
discreetly
about
the
rude
little
church
with
its
pictures
and
its
modest
attempt
at
stained
glass
no
wonder
all
this
impresses
the
ignorant
native
whispered
the
colonel
catching
himself
up
suddenly
from
sharing
in
that
weakness
without
the
wild
march
storm
swept
the
white
world
within
another
climate
reigned
something
of
summer
and
the
south
of
italy
herself
transplanted
to
this
little
island
of
civilisation
anchored
in
the
northern
waste
you
seen
all
the
big
cathedrals
eh
good
many
there
was
still
a
subdued
rustling
in
the
church
and
outside
still
the
clanging
bell
contended
with
the
storm
and
this
makes
you
smile
n
no
returned
the
older
man
with
a
kind
of
reluctance
i
seen
many
a
worse
church
america
full
of
hey
so
far
as
dignity
goes
the
colonel
was
wrestling
with
some
vague
impression
difficult
for
him
to
formulate
you
see
you
ca
build
anything
with
wood
that
better
than
a
for
looks
just
it
beats
all
your
fancy
gimcracks
even
brick
beats
everything
else
hollow
except
stone
then
they
got
candles
we
went
on
last
night
about
the
luxury
of
they
do
bring
in
here
do
in
our
prairie
and
southern
country
churches
i
know
but
look
at
those
altar
lights
the
boy
was
too
busy
looking
at
sister
winifred
i
tell
you
sir
a
man
never
made
a
finer
thing
than
a
tall
wax
candle
sh
must
talk
in
church
the
colonel
stared
a
moment
at
the
boy
presumption
drew
himself
up
a
little
pompously
and
crossed
his
arms
over
his
huge
chest
why
they
got
an
organ
the
boy
forgot
his
strict
views
on
church
etiquette
as
the
sudden
sweetness
swelled
in
the
air
brother
paul
with
head
thrown
back
and
white
face
lifted
was
playing
slowly
absently
like
one
who
listens
to
some
great
choir
invisible
and
keeps
their
time
with
a
few
obedient
but
unnecessary
chords
and
yet
the
fella
can
play
the
colonel
admitted
the
native
choir
composed
entirely
of
little
boys
sang
their
way
truly
through
the
service
father
brachet
celebrating
mass
brother
paul
ill
is
he
look
the
had
swayed
and
drooped
forward
over
the
keyboard
but
his
choir
sang
steadily
on
he
recovered
himself
and
beckoned
one
of
the
boys
to
his
side
when
he
rose
the
child
nodded
and
took
the
organist
place
playing
quite
creditably
to
the
end
brother
paul
sat
in
the
corner
with
bowed
head
coming
out
they
were
in
time
to
confront
sister
winifred
holding
back
the
youngest
children
eager
to
anticipate
their
proper
places
in
the
procession
the
boy
looked
fixedly
at
her
wondering
suddenly
meeting
the
clear
eyes
he
smiled
and
then
shrank
inwardly
at
his
forwardness
he
could
not
tell
if
she
remembered
him
the
colonel
finding
himself
next
her
at
the
door
bowed
and
stood
back
for
her
to
pass
no
she
said
gently
my
little
children
must
wait
for
the
older
ones
you
have
them
under
good
discipline
madam
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
furry
shoulder
of
the
smallest
the
boy
stood
behind
the
colonel
unaccountably
shy
in
the
presence
of
the
only
white
woman
he
had
seen
in
nearly
seven
months
she
be
any
older
than
he
and
yet
she
was
a
nun
what
a
gulf
opened
at
the
word
sister
winifred
and
her
charges
fell
into
rank
at
the
tail
of
the
little
procession
and
vanished
in
the
falling
snow
at
breakfast
the
colonel
would
not
sit
down
till
he
was
presented
to
brother
paul
sir
he
said
in
his
florid
but
entirely
sincere
fashion
i
should
like
to
thank
you
for
the
pleasure
of
hearing
that
music
we
were
much
impressed
sir
by
the
singing
how
old
is
the
boy
who
played
the
organ
ten
said
brother
paul
and
for
the
first
time
the
boy
saw
him
smile
yes
i
think
he
has
music
in
him
our
little
jerome
and
how
well
your
choir
has
the
service
by
heart
their
unison
is
perfect
yes
said
father
brachet
from
the
head
of
the
table
our
music
has
never
been
so
good
as
since
paul
came
among
us
he
lifted
his
hand
and
every
one
bowed
his
head
after
grace
father
richmond
took
the
floor
conversationally
as
seemed
to
be
his
wont
and
breakfast
went
on
as
supper
had
the
night
before
to
the
accompaniment
of
his
shrewd
observations
and
lively
anecdotes
in
the
midst
of
all
the
laughter
and
good
cheer
brother
paul
sat
at
the
end
of
the
board
eating
absently
saying
nothing
and
no
one
speaking
to
him
father
richmond
especially
but
indeed
all
of
them
seemed
arrant
worldlings
beside
the
youngest
of
the
the
colonel
could
more
easily
imagine
father
richmond
walking
the
streets
of
paris
or
of
rome
than
hitting
the
yukon
trail
he
marvelled
afresh
at
the
devotion
that
brought
such
a
man
to
wear
out
his
fine
attainments
his
scholarship
his
energy
his
wide
and
catholic
knowledge
in
travelling
winter
after
winter
hundreds
of
miles
over
the
ice
from
one
indian
village
to
another
you
could
not
divorce
father
richmond
in
your
mind
from
the
larger
world
outside
he
spoke
with
its
accent
he
looked
with
his
humourous
experienced
eyes
you
found
it
natural
to
think
of
him
in
very
human
relations
you
wondered
about
his
people
and
what
brought
him
to
this
not
so
with
brother
paul
he
was
one
of
those
who
suggest
no
country
upon
any
printed
map
you
have
to
be
reminded
that
you
do
not
know
his
birthplace
or
his
history
it
was
this
same
brother
paul
who
after
breakfast
and
despite
the
pymeut
incident
offered
to
show
the
over
the
school
the
big
was
full
of
natives
and
decidedly
stuffy
they
did
not
stay
long
upstairs
i
sleep
here
in
the
dormitory
said
the
brother
and
i
live
with
the
pupils
as
much
as
i
can
i
often
eat
with
them
he
added
as
one
who
mounts
a
climax
they
have
to
be
taught
and
they
have
to
be
taught
it
over
again
every
day
except
music
apparently
except
music
and
games
brother
vincent
teaches
them
football
and
baseball
and
plays
with
them
and
works
with
them
part
of
each
day
is
devoted
to
manual
training
and
to
sport
he
led
the
way
to
the
workshop
one
of
our
brothers
is
a
carpenter
and
master
mechanic
he
called
to
a
pupil
passing
the
door
and
told
him
the
strangers
would
like
to
inspect
the
school
work
very
proudly
the
lad
obeyed
he
himself
was
a
carpenter
and
showed
his
table
the
eye
fell
on
a
sled
yes
said
the
lad
that
kind
better
your
kind
no
good
he
had
evidently
made
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
boy
masterpiece
yours
is
splendid
admitted
the
unskilled
workman
will
you
sell
it
the
colonel
asked
brother
paul
they
make
them
to
sell
was
the
answer
and
the
transaction
was
soon
effected
it
has
stopped
snowing
and
ze
wind
is
fallen
said
father
brachet
going
to
the
window
an
hour
or
so
after
they
had
come
in
from
dinner
the
colonel
exchanged
looks
with
the
boy
and
drew
out
his
watch
later
than
i
thought
much
the
colonel
agreed
and
sat
considering
watch
in
hand
i
sink
our
friends
must
see
now
ze
girls
school
and
ze
laundry
hein
to
be
sure
agreed
father
richmond
i
will
take
you
over
and
give
you
into
the
hands
of
our
mother
superior
why
it
much
warmer
said
the
boy
as
they
went
by
the
cross
and
father
richmond
greeted
the
native
boys
who
were
packing
down
the
fresh
snow
under
their
broad
shoes
laughing
and
shouting
to
one
another
as
they
made
anew
the
familiar
mission
trails
the
door
of
the
house
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
settlement
was
opened
by
sister
winifred
friends
of
ours
from
the
white
camp
below
she
acknowledged
the
nameless
introduction
smiling
but
at
the
request
that
followed
ah
it
is
too
bad
that
just
the
mother
superior
she
is
too
faint
and
weak
to
go
about
will
you
see
her
father
yes
if
you
will
show
these
strangers
the
school
and
laundry
and
oh
yes
i
will
show
them
she
led
the
way
into
the
cheerful
schoolroom
where
big
girls
and
little
girls
were
sitting
about
amusing
themselves
in
the
quiet
of
a
long
sunday
afternoon
several
of
the
younger
children
ran
to
her
as
she
came
in
and
stood
holding
fast
to
the
folds
of
her
black
habit
staring
up
at
the
strangers
while
she
explained
the
kind
of
instruction
given
the
system
and
the
order
reigning
in
each
department
finally
she
persuaded
a
little
girl
only
six
years
old
to
take
her
dusky
face
out
of
the
long
flowing
veil
of
the
nun
and
show
how
quickly
she
could
read
a
sentence
that
sister
winifred
wrote
on
the
blackboard
then
others
were
called
on
and
gave
examples
of
their
accomplishments
in
easy
arithmetic
and
spelling
the
children
must
have
been
very
much
bored
with
themselves
that
stormy
sunday
for
they
entered
into
the
examination
with
a
quite
unnatural
zest
two
of
the
elder
girls
recited
and
some
specimens
of
penmanship
and
composition
were
shown
the
delicate
complexion
of
the
little
nun
flushed
to
a
pretty
pink
as
these
pupils
of
hers
won
the
colonel
old
fashioned
compliments
and
they
are
taught
most
particularly
of
all
she
hastened
to
say
cooking
housekeeping
and
sewing
whereupon
specimens
of
needlework
were
brought
out
and
cast
like
pearls
before
the
swine
eyes
of
the
ignorant
men
but
they
were
impressed
in
their
benighted
way
and
said
so
and
we
teach
them
she
led
the
way
with
the
children
trooping
after
to
the
washhouse
no
run
back
you
take
cold
run
back
and
you
shall
sing
for
the
strangers
before
they
go
she
smiled
them
away
a
clean
little
throng
striking
contrast
to
the
neglected
filthy
children
seen
in
the
native
villages
as
they
were
going
into
the
laundry
father
richmond
came
out
of
the
house
and
stopped
to
point
out
to
the
colonel
a
enclosure
the
sisters
garden
and
he
told
how
marvellously
in
the
brief
summer
some
of
the
hardier
vegetables
flourished
there
they
spring
up
like
magic
at
the
edge
of
the
and
they
do
not
rest
from
their
growing
all
night
if
the
time
is
short
they
have
twice
as
much
sunlight
as
with
you
they
drink
it
in
the
whole
summer
night
as
well
as
all
the
day
and
over
here
is
the
fathers
garden
talking
still
he
led
the
way
towards
a
larger
enclosure
on
the
other
side
of
the
cross
sister
winifred
paused
a
moment
and
then
as
they
did
not
turn
back
and
the
boy
stood
waiting
she
took
him
into
the
and
into
the
and
then
returned
to
the
betubbed
apartment
first
invaded
there
was
only
one
blot
on
the
fairness
of
that
model
laundry
a
heap
of
torn
and
dirty
canvas
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
the
boy
vaguely
thought
it
looked
familiar
before
the
sister
blushing
faintly
said
we
hope
you
wo
go
before
we
have
time
to
repair
it
why
it
our
old
yes
it
is
very
much
cut
and
torn
but
you
do
not
go
at
once
yes
oh
father
brachet
thought
you
would
stay
for
a
few
days
at
least
we
have
no
time
you
go
like
the
rest
for
gold
like
the
rest
but
you
came
before
to
help
poor
nicholas
out
of
his
trouble
he
was
quite
able
to
help
himself
as
it
turned
out
why
will
you
go
so
far
and
at
such
risk
she
said
with
a
suddenness
that
startled
them
both
i
i
well
i
think
i
go
chiefly
because
i
want
to
get
my
home
back
i
lost
my
home
when
i
was
a
little
chap
where
is
your
home
here
how
long
have
you
been
here
nearly
two
years
then
how
can
you
call
it
home
i
do
that
only
that
i
may
speak
your
language
of
course
it
is
not
my
real
home
where
is
the
real
home
i
hope
it
is
in
heaven
she
said
with
a
simplicity
that
took
away
all
taint
of
cant
or
mere
but
where
do
you
come
from
i
come
from
montreal
oh
and
do
you
ever
go
back
to
visit
your
people
no
i
never
go
back
but
you
will
some
time
no
i
shall
never
go
back
do
you
to
she
dropped
her
eyes
but
very
steadfastly
she
said
my
work
is
here
but
you
are
young
and
you
may
live
a
great
great
many
years
she
nodded
and
looked
out
of
the
open
door
the
colonel
and
the
travelling
priest
were
walking
in
indian
file
the
path
yes
she
said
in
a
level
voice
i
shall
grow
old
here
and
here
i
shall
be
buried
i
shall
never
understand
it
i
have
such
a
longing
for
my
home
i
came
here
ready
to
bear
anything
that
i
might
be
able
to
get
it
back
she
looked
at
him
steadily
and
gravely
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
doubt
if
you
would
be
satisfied
even
if
you
got
it
back
now
what
makes
you
think
that
he
said
sharply
because
and
she
checked
herself
as
if
on
the
verge
of
something
too
personal
you
can
never
get
back
a
thing
you
lost
when
the
old
thing
is
there
again
you
are
not
as
you
were
when
you
lost
it
and
the
change
in
you
makes
the
old
thing
new
and
strange
oh
it
plain
i
am
very
different
from
you
but
he
said
it
with
a
kind
of
uneasy
defiance
besides
in
any
case
i
shall
do
it
for
my
sister
sake
oh
you
have
a
sister
he
nodded
how
long
since
you
left
her
it
a
good
while
now
perhaps
your
sister
wo
want
that
particular
home
any
more
than
you
when
you
two
meet
again
then
seeming
not
to
notice
the
shade
on
her
companion
face
i
promised
my
children
they
should
sing
for
you
do
you
mind
will
your
friend
come
in
too
and
looking
from
the
door
after
the
colonel
and
the
father
as
they
turned
to
rejoin
them
he
is
odd
that
big
friend
of
yours
she
said
quite
like
a
human
being
as
the
boy
thought
instantly
he
not
odd
i
assure
you
he
called
me
she
spoke
with
a
charming
piqued
childishness
you
see
he
did
know
your
name
what
is
your
name
sister
winifred
but
your
real
name
he
said
with
the
american
insistence
on
his
own
point
of
view
that
is
my
only
name
she
answered
with
dignity
and
led
the
way
back
into
the
schoolroom
another
older
nun
was
there
and
when
the
others
rejoined
them
they
made
the
girls
sing
now
we
have
shown
you
enough
said
father
richmond
rising
boasted
to
you
enough
of
the
very
little
we
are
able
to
accomplish
here
we
must
save
something
for
ah
we
take
to
the
trail
again
said
the
colonel
and
added
his
madam
sister
winifred
seeing
he
expected
it
gave
him
her
hand
and
thank
you
for
coming
for
your
poor
he
said
shyly
as
he
turned
away
and
left
a
gift
in
her
palm
thank
you
for
showing
us
all
this
the
boy
said
lingering
but
not
daring
to
shake
hands
it
it
seems
very
wonderful
i
had
no
idea
a
mission
meant
all
this
oh
it
means
more
more
than
anything
you
can
in
the
early
evening
the
was
invaded
by
the
lads
school
for
their
usual
sunday
night
entertainment
very
proudly
these
boys
and
young
men
sang
their
glees
and
choruses
played
the
fiddle
recited
even
danced
pity
mac
is
here
awful
pity
sunday
too
brother
etienne
sang
some
french
military
songs
and
it
came
out
that
he
had
served
in
the
french
army
father
roget
sang
also
in
french
explaining
himself
with
a
humourous
skill
in
pantomime
that
set
the
room
in
a
roar
well
said
the
colonel
when
he
stood
up
to
say
i
enjoyed
an
evening
so
much
for
years
it
is
very
early
still
said
father
brachet
wrinkling
up
his
face
in
a
smile
ah
but
we
have
to
make
such
an
early
start
the
colonel
went
up
to
bed
leaving
the
boy
to
go
to
father
room
to
look
at
his
grammar
of
the
indian
language
the
instant
the
door
was
shut
the
priest
set
down
the
lamp
and
laid
his
hands
on
the
young
man
shoulders
my
son
you
must
not
go
on
this
mad
journey
i
must
you
know
you
must
sit
there
he
pushed
him
into
a
chair
let
me
tell
you
i
do
not
speak
as
the
ignorant
i
have
in
my
day
travelled
many
hundreds
of
miles
on
the
ice
but
i
done
it
in
the
season
when
the
trail
at
its
best
with
dogs
my
son
and
with
tried
native
servants
i
know
it
is
pleasanter
that
way
but
pleasanter
it
is
the
way
to
keep
alive
but
the
indians
travel
with
for
short
distances
yes
and
they
are
inured
to
the
climate
you
you
know
nothing
of
what
lies
before
you
but
we
find
out
as
other
people
have
the
boy
smiled
confidently
i
assure
you
my
son
it
is
madness
this
thing
you
are
trying
to
do
the
chances
of
either
of
you
coming
out
alive
are
one
in
fifty
in
fifty
did
i
say
in
five
hundred
i
do
think
so
father
we
do
mean
to
travel
when
but
you
have
to
travel
to
stay
in
such
places
as
you
find
yourself
in
will
be
to
starve
or
if
by
any
miracle
you
escape
the
worst
effects
of
cold
and
hunger
you
get
caught
in
the
ice
in
the
spring
and
go
down
to
destruction
on
a
floe
you
no
conception
what
it
like
if
you
were
six
weeks
earlier
or
six
weeks
later
i
would
hold
my
peace
the
boy
looked
at
the
priest
and
then
away
it
going
to
be
so
bad
would
they
leave
their
bones
on
the
ice
would
they
go
washing
by
the
mission
in
the
great
spring
flood
that
all
men
spoke
of
with
the
same
grave
look
he
had
a
sudden
vision
of
the
torrent
as
it
would
be
in
june
among
the
whirling
that
swept
by
two
bodies
swollen
unrecognisable
one
gigantic
one
dressed
gaily
in
chaparejos
and
neither
would
lift
his
head
but
like
men
bent
grimly
upon
some
great
errand
they
would
hurry
on
past
the
tall
white
cross
with
never
a
sign
on
on
to
the
sea
be
persuaded
my
son
dimly
the
boy
knew
he
was
even
now
borne
along
upon
a
current
equally
irresistible
this
one
setting
northward
as
that
other
back
to
the
south
he
found
himself
shaking
his
head
under
the
jesuit
remonstrant
eyes
we
lost
so
much
time
already
we
could
possibly
turn
back
now
then
here
my
grammar
with
an
almost
comic
change
of
tone
and
manner
the
priest
turned
to
the
table
where
the
lamp
stood
among
piles
of
neatly
and
docketed
papers
he
undid
one
of
the
packets
with
an
ear
on
the
sudden
sounds
outside
in
the
passage
brother
paul
got
it
in
the
schoolhouse
brother
paul
he
had
been
at
the
entertainment
and
no
one
seemed
to
have
missed
him
how
did
sister
winifred
know
asked
another
voice
old
maria
told
her
father
richmond
got
up
and
opened
the
door
what
is
it
it
a
indian
baby
the
father
looked
down
as
if
it
might
be
on
the
threshold
brother
paul
found
it
below
at
the
village
all
done
up
ready
to
be
abandoned
tell
sister
winifred
i
see
about
it
in
the
morning
she
says
pardon
me
father
she
says
that
is
like
a
man
if
i
do
not
bring
the
little
indian
in
twenty
minutes
she
will
come
herself
and
get
it
father
richmond
laughed
my
son
and
he
went
downstairs
with
the
others
colonel
you
asleep
the
boy
asked
softly
no
he
struggled
in
silence
with
his
mucklucks
presently
is
it
frightfully
strange
he
mused
aloud
does
it
pull
a
fella
up
by
the
roots
somehow
to
see
americans
on
this
old
track
the
colonel
had
the
bedclothes
drawn
up
to
his
eyes
under
the
white
quilt
he
made
some
undistinguishable
sound
but
he
kept
his
eyes
fastened
on
his
pardner
everything
that
we
americans
have
done
everything
that
we
are
is
achieved
by
the
grace
of
goin
bang
the
other
way
the
boy
pulled
off
a
muckluck
and
threw
it
half
across
the
room
and
yet
and
yet
he
sat
with
one
in
his
hand
and
stared
at
the
candle
i
wonder
colonel
if
it
anybody
to
be
a
hustler
and
a
millionaire
satisfies
echoed
the
colonel
pushing
his
chin
over
the
who
expects
to
be
satisfied
why
every
man
woman
and
child
on
the
top
o
the
earth
and
it
just
strikes
me
i
never
personally
known
anybody
get
there
but
these
fellas
at
holy
cross
the
colonel
pushed
back
the
bedclothes
a
little
farther
with
his
chin
have
you
got
the
gumption
to
see
why
it
is
this
place
and
these
men
take
such
a
hold
on
you
it
because
you
eaten
slept
and
lived
for
half
a
year
in
a
space
the
size
of
this
bedroom
we
got
so
used
to
narrowing
life
down
that
the
first
result
of
a
little
larger
outlook
is
to
make
us
dizzy
now
you
hurry
up
and
get
to
bed
sleep
it
off
the
boy
woke
at
four
and
after
the
by
which
he
consulted
his
watch
had
flickered
out
he
lay
a
long
time
staring
at
the
dark
silence
still
reigned
supreme
when
at
last
he
got
up
washed
and
dressed
and
went
downstairs
an
irresistible
restlessness
had
seized
hold
of
him
he
pulled
on
his
furs
cautiously
opened
the
door
and
went
out
down
over
the
crisp
new
crust
to
the
river
and
back
in
the
dimness
past
the
fathers
house
to
the
settlement
behind
then
to
the
right
towards
the
hillside
as
he
stumbled
up
the
slope
he
came
to
a
little
half
hidden
in
the
snow
white
wooden
crosses
marked
the
graves
and
here
i
shall
be
buried
she
had
said
here
he
came
down
the
hill
and
round
by
the
sisters
house
that
window
that
was
where
a
light
had
shone
the
evening
they
arrived
and
a
nun
sister
winifred
had
stood
drawing
the
thick
curtains
shutting
out
the
world
he
thought
in
the
intense
stillness
that
he
heard
sounds
from
that
upper
room
yes
surely
an
infant
cry
a
curious
feeling
came
upon
him
as
he
turned
away
and
went
slowly
back
towards
the
other
house
he
halted
a
moment
under
the
cross
and
stared
up
at
it
the
door
of
the
fathers
house
opened
and
the
travelling
priest
stood
on
the
threshold
the
boy
went
over
to
him
nodding
so
you
are
all
ready
eager
to
go
from
us
no
but
you
see
i
see
he
held
the
door
open
and
the
boy
went
in
i
do
believe
the
colonel
awake
yet
he
said
as
he
took
off
his
furs
i
just
run
up
and
rouse
him
it
is
very
early
the
priest
laid
his
hand
on
the
young
arm
and
he
will
not
sleep
so
well
for
many
a
night
to
come
it
is
an
hour
till
breakfast
henry
had
lit
the
fire
and
now
left
it
roaring
the
priest
took
a
chair
and
pushed
one
forward
for
his
guest
the
boy
sat
down
stretched
his
legs
out
straight
towards
the
fire
and
lifting
his
hands
clasped
them
behind
his
head
the
priest
read
the
homesick
face
like
a
book
why
are
you
up
here
before
there
was
time
for
reply
he
added
surely
a
young
man
like
you
could
find
nearer
home
many
a
gate
ajar
and
you
must
have
had
glimpses
through
of
things
many
and
fair
oh
yes
i
had
glimpses
of
those
things
well
what
i
wanted
most
i
never
saw
you
wanted
to
be
ah
it
is
one
of
the
results
of
agnosticism
the
boy
never
saw
the
smile
i
said
and
i
was
not
lying
that
i
came
away
to
shorten
the
business
of
to
buy
back
an
old
place
we
love
my
sister
and
i
but
which
does
she
love
best
the
old
place
or
the
young
brother
oh
she
cares
about
me
no
doubt
o
that
he
smiled
the
smile
of
faith
has
she
an
understanding
heart
the
most
i
know
then
she
would
be
glad
to
know
you
had
found
a
home
for
the
spirit
a
home
for
the
body
what
does
it
matter
in
the
pause
father
brachet
opened
the
door
but
seemed
suddenly
to
remember
some
imperative
call
elsewhere
the
boy
jumped
up
but
the
superior
had
vanished
without
even
the
boy
sat
down
again
of
course
he
went
on
with
that
touch
of
pedantry
so
common
in
american
youth
the
difficulty
in
my
case
is
an
intellectual
one
i
think
i
appreciate
the
splendid
work
you
do
and
i
see
as
i
never
saw
before
he
stopped
you
strike
your
foot
against
the
same
stone
of
stumbling
over
which
the
pharisees
fell
when
the
man
whom
jesus
healed
by
the
way
replied
to
their
questioning
he
be
a
sinner
or
no
i
know
not
one
thing
i
know
that
whereas
i
was
blind
now
i
see
i
do
deny
that
the
life
here
has
been
a
revelation
to
me
i
not
talkin
about
creeds
for
i
do
know
much
about
them
and
i
think
it
in
me
to
care
much
but
so
far
as
the
work
here
is
concerned
he
paused
we
can
take
little
credit
for
that
it
is
the
outcome
of
our
order
the
boy
failed
to
catch
the
effect
of
the
capital
letter
yes
it
just
that
the
order
the
good
government
a
fella
would
be
a
bigot
if
he
could
see
that
the
system
is
as
nearly
perfect
as
a
human
institution
can
be
that
has
been
said
before
of
the
society
of
jesus
but
he
spoke
with
the
wise
man
tolerance
for
the
discoveries
of
the
young
still
it
was
not
to
discuss
the
merits
of
his
order
that
he
had
got
up
an
hour
before
his
time
i
understand
maybe
better
than
yourself
something
of
the
restlessness
that
drove
you
here
you
understand
the
priest
nodded
you
had
the
excuse
of
the
old
plantation
and
the
sister
the
boy
sat
up
suddenly
a
little
annoyed
the
priest
kept
on
but
you
felt
a
great
longing
to
make
a
breach
in
the
high
walls
that
shut
you
in
you
wanted
to
fare
away
on
some
voyage
of
discovery
was
that
it
he
paused
now
in
his
turn
but
the
boy
looked
straight
before
him
saying
nothing
the
priest
leaned
forward
with
a
deeper
gravity
it
will
be
a
fortunate
expedition
this
my
son
thou
discover
and
in
time
still
the
boy
said
nothing
the
other
resumed
more
lightly
in
america
we
combine
our
travels
with
business
but
it
is
no
new
idea
in
the
world
that
a
young
man
should
have
his
wanderjahr
before
he
finds
what
he
wants
or
even
finds
acquiescence
it
did
not
need
wilhelm
meister
to
set
the
feet
of
youth
on
that
trail
it
did
not
need
the
crusades
it
as
old
as
the
idea
of
a
golden
fleece
or
a
promised
land
it
was
the
first
man
first
inkling
of
heaven
the
boy
pricked
his
ears
was
this
heresy
the
old
idea
of
the
strenuous
to
leave
home
and
comfort
and
security
and
go
out
to
search
for
wisdom
or
holiness
or
happiness
whether
it
is
gold
or
the
san
grael
the
instinct
of
search
is
deep
planted
in
the
race
it
is
this
that
the
handful
of
men
who
live
in
what
they
call
world
it
is
this
they
forget
every
hour
in
the
greater
world
outside
someone
somewhere
is
starting
out
upon
this
journey
he
may
go
only
as
far
as
germany
to
study
philosophy
or
to
the
nearest
and
find
there
the
thing
he
seeks
or
he
may
go
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
still
not
find
it
he
may
travel
in
a
hindu
gown
or
a
mongolian
tunic
or
he
comes
like
father
brachet
out
of
his
vineyards
in
pleasant
land
of
france
or
like
you
out
of
a
country
where
all
problems
are
to
be
solved
by
machinery
but
my
point
is
when
all
the
other
armies
of
the
world
are
disbanded
that
army
my
son
will
be
still
upon
the
march
they
were
silent
awhile
and
still
the
young
face
gave
no
sign
to
many
the
travelling
priest
went
on
the
impulse
is
a
blind
one
or
a
shy
one
shrinking
from
calling
itself
by
the
old
names
but
none
the
less
this
instinct
for
the
quest
is
still
the
gallant
way
of
youth
confronted
by
a
sense
of
the
homelessness
they
can
not
think
will
last
that
it
father
that
it
the
boy
burst
out
homelessness
to
feel
that
is
to
feel
something
urging
you
he
stopped
urging
you
to
take
up
your
staff
said
the
priest
they
were
silent
a
moment
and
then
the
same
musical
voice
tolled
out
the
words
like
a
low
bell
but
with
all
your
journeying
my
son
you
will
come
to
no
continuing
city
it
no
use
to
say
this
to
me
you
see
i
am
i
tell
you
why
i
say
it
the
priest
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
i
see
men
going
up
and
down
all
their
lives
upon
this
quest
once
in
a
great
while
i
see
one
for
whom
i
think
the
journey
may
be
shortened
how
shortened
a
heavy
step
on
the
stair
and
the
boy
seemed
to
wake
from
a
dream
said
the
colonel
coming
in
cheerily
rubbing
his
hands
i
am
very
jealous
he
glanced
at
the
boy
furs
on
the
floor
you
have
been
out
seeing
the
rest
of
the
mission
without
me
no
no
we
will
show
you
the
rest
as
much
as
you
care
for
after
breakfast
i
afraid
we
ought
to
delay
but
they
did
for
a
few
minutes
while
zey
are
putting
a
little
fresh
meat
on
your
sled
as
father
brachet
said
they
went
first
to
see
the
dogs
fed
for
they
got
breakfast
when
they
were
at
home
those
pampered
mission
dogs
and
now
we
will
show
you
our
our
caches
while
father
brachet
looked
in
the
bunch
for
the
key
he
wanted
a
native
came
by
with
a
pail
he
entered
the
low
building
on
the
left
leaving
wide
the
door
what
no
is
it
really
no
not
the
colonel
was
more
excited
than
the
boy
had
ever
seen
him
without
the
smallest
ceremony
he
left
the
side
of
his
obliging
host
strode
to
the
open
door
and
disappeared
inside
what
on
earth
the
matter
i
can
not
tell
it
is
but
our
they
followed
and
looking
in
at
the
door
the
boy
saw
a
picture
that
for
many
a
day
painted
itself
on
his
memory
for
inside
the
dim
place
stood
the
big
kentuckian
with
one
arm
round
the
cow
talking
to
her
and
rubbing
her
nose
while
down
his
own
a
tear
trickled
hey
well
yes
just
my
view
sukey
yes
old
girl
alaska
a
funny
kind
o
place
for
you
and
me
to
be
in
is
it
hey
and
he
stroked
the
cow
and
sniffed
back
the
salt
water
and
called
out
seeing
the
boy
look
they
got
a
thoroughbred
bull
too
an
a
heifer
lord
i
have
been
in
any
place
so
like
home
for
a
coon
age
you
go
and
look
at
the
caches
i
stay
here
while
sambo
milks
her
my
name
is
sebastian
oh
all
right
reckon
you
can
milk
her
under
that
name
too
when
they
came
back
the
colonel
was
still
there
exchanging
views
about
alaska
with
sukey
and
with
sebastian
about
the
bull
sister
winifred
came
hurrying
over
the
snow
to
the
with
a
little
tin
pail
in
her
hand
ah
but
you
are
slow
sebastian
she
called
out
almost
petulantly
she
said
to
the
others
and
with
a
quick
clutch
at
a
respectful
and
submissive
demeanour
she
added
half
aside
what
do
you
think
father
brachet
they
forgot
that
baby
because
he
is
good
and
sleeps
late
they
drink
up
all
the
milk
ah
there
is
very
little
now
very
little
father
said
sebastian
returning
to
the
task
from
which
the
colonel
conversation
had
diverted
him
i
put
aside
some
last
night
and
they
used
it
i
send
you
to
bring
me
only
a
little
drop
she
was
by
sebastian
now
holding
out
the
small
pail
unmindful
of
the
others
who
were
talking
stock
and
you
stay
and
stay
give
me
your
can
the
boy
took
it
from
her
and
held
it
inside
the
big
so
that
the
thin
stream
struck
it
sharply
there
it
is
enough
her
shawl
had
fallen
the
colonel
gathered
it
up
i
will
carry
the
milk
back
for
you
said
the
boy
noticing
how
red
and
cold
the
slim
hands
were
your
fingers
will
be
frostbitten
if
you
do
wrap
them
up
she
pulled
the
old
shawl
closely
round
her
and
set
a
brisk
pace
back
to
the
sisters
house
i
must
go
carefully
or
i
might
slip
and
if
i
spilt
the
milk
oh
you
must
do
that
she
paused
suddenly
and
then
went
on
but
more
slowly
than
before
a
glaze
had
formed
on
the
path
and
one
must
needs
walk
warily
once
she
looked
back
with
anxiety
and
seeing
that
the
precious
milk
was
being
carried
with
due
caution
her
glance
went
gratefully
to
the
boy
face
he
felt
her
eyes
i
being
careful
he
laughed
a
little
embarrassed
and
not
at
first
lifting
his
bent
head
when
after
an
instant
he
did
so
he
found
the
beautiful
calm
eyes
full
upon
him
but
no
there
she
turned
away
gentle
and
reflective
and
was
walking
on
when
some
quick
summons
seemed
to
reach
her
she
stopped
quite
still
again
as
if
seized
suddenly
by
a
detaining
hand
her
own
hands
dropped
straight
at
her
sides
and
the
rusty
shawl
hung
free
a
second
time
she
turned
the
boy
thought
to
him
again
but
as
he
glanced
up
wondering
he
saw
that
the
fixed
yet
serene
look
went
past
him
like
a
a
neglected
slighted
feeling
came
over
him
she
was
thinking
of
him
the
least
in
the
world
nor
even
of
the
milk
he
was
at
such
pains
to
carry
for
her
what
was
she
staring
at
he
turned
his
head
over
his
right
shoulder
nothing
no
one
as
he
came
slowly
on
he
kept
glancing
at
her
she
still
with
upturned
face
stood
there
in
the
attitude
of
an
obedient
child
receiving
admonition
one
cold
little
hand
fluttered
up
to
her
silver
cross
ah
he
turned
again
understanding
now
the
drift
if
not
the
inner
meaning
of
that
summons
that
had
come
your
friend
said
something
she
nodded
faintly
riverwards
towards
the
mission
sign
did
you
feel
like
that
about
it
when
you
saw
it
first
oh
a
i
not
religious
like
the
colonel
she
smiled
and
walked
on
at
the
door
as
she
took
the
milk
instead
of
thank
you
wait
a
moment
she
was
back
again
directly
you
are
going
far
beyond
the
mission
so
carry
this
with
you
i
hope
it
will
guide
you
as
it
guides
us
on
his
way
back
to
the
fathers
house
he
kept
looking
at
what
sister
winifred
had
given
him
a
latin
cross
of
silver
scarce
three
inches
long
at
the
intersection
of
the
arms
it
bore
a
chased
lozenge
on
which
was
a
mitre
above
it
the
word
alaska
and
beneath
the
crossed
keys
of
peter
and
the
letters
as
he
came
near
to
where
the
colonel
and
his
hosts
were
he
slipped
the
cross
into
his
pocket
his
fingers
encountered
muckluck
medal
upon
some
wholly
involuntary
impulse
he
withdrew
sister
winifred
gift
and
transferred
it
to
another
pocket
but
he
laughed
to
himself
both
sort
o
charms
after
all
and
again
he
looked
at
the
big
cross
and
the
heaven
above
it
and
down
at
the
domain
of
the
inua
the
jealous
god
of
the
yukon
twenty
minutes
later
the
two
travellers
were
saying
to
the
men
of
holy
cross
and
making
their
surprised
and
delighted
acknowledgments
for
the
canvas
cover
they
found
upon
the
colonel
new
sled
oh
it
is
not
we
said
father
brachet
it
is
made
by
ze
sisters
zey
shall
know
zat
you
were
pleased
father
richmond
held
the
boy
hand
a
moment
i
see
you
go
my
son
but
i
shall
see
you
return
no
father
i
shall
hardly
come
this
way
again
father
brachet
smiling
watched
them
start
up
the
long
trail
i
sink
we
shall
meet
again
were
his
last
words
what
does
he
mean
asked
the
colonel
a
little
high
and
mightily
what
plan
has
he
got
for
a
meeting
same
plan
as
you
got
i
i
believe
you
both
call
it
the
holy
cross
thermometer
had
registered
twenty
degrees
below
zero
but
the
keen
wind
blowing
down
the
river
made
it
seem
more
like
forty
below
when
they
stopped
to
lunch
they
had
to
crouch
down
behind
the
sled
to
stand
the
cold
and
the
boy
found
that
his
face
and
ears
were
badly
the
colonel
discovered
that
the
same
thing
had
befallen
the
toes
of
his
left
foot
they
rubbed
the
afflicted
members
and
tried
not
to
let
their
thoughts
stray
backwards
the
jesuits
had
told
them
of
an
inhabited
cabin
miles
up
the
river
and
they
tried
to
fix
their
minds
on
that
in
a
desultory
way
when
the
wind
allowed
it
they
spoke
of
min√≥ok
and
of
odds
and
ends
heard
about
the
trail
they
spoke
of
the
big
chimney
cabin
and
of
how
at
anvik
they
would
have
their
last
shave
the
one
subject
neither
seemed
anxious
to
mention
was
holy
cross
it
was
a
little
marked
the
colonel
felt
but
he
was
going
to
say
the
first
word
since
he
meant
to
say
the
last
about
five
the
gale
went
down
but
it
came
on
to
snow
at
seven
the
colonel
said
decidedly
we
ca
make
that
cabin
why
not
because
i
not
going
any
further
with
this
foot
he
threw
down
the
and
limped
after
wood
for
the
fire
the
boy
tilted
the
sled
up
by
an
and
spread
the
new
canvas
so
that
it
gave
some
scant
shelter
from
the
snow
luckily
for
once
the
wind
how
grown
quite
for
the
yukon
it
would
be
thought
a
good
stiff
breeze
almost
anywhere
else
directly
they
had
swallowed
supper
the
colonel
remarked
i
feel
as
ready
for
my
bed
as
i
did
saturday
night
ah
saturday
night
that
was
different
they
looked
at
each
other
with
the
same
thought
well
that
bed
at
holy
cross
is
any
whiter
than
this
laughed
the
boy
but
the
colonel
was
not
to
be
deceived
by
this
light
and
airy
reference
his
own
unwilling
sentiments
were
a
guide
to
the
boy
and
he
felt
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
restore
the
holy
cross
incident
to
its
proper
proportions
those
last
words
of
father
brachet
bothered
him
had
they
been
gettin
at
the
boy
you
think
all
that
mission
business
mighty
wonderful
just
because
you
run
across
it
in
alaska
and
is
it
wonderful
at
all
the
boy
spoke
dreamily
and
from
force
of
old
habit
held
out
his
mittened
hands
to
the
unavailing
fire
the
colonel
gave
a
prefatory
grunt
of
depreciation
but
he
was
pulling
his
blankets
out
from
under
the
stuff
on
the
sled
the
boy
turned
his
head
and
watched
him
with
a
little
smile
admit
that
i
always
to
think
the
jesuits
were
a
shady
lot
so
they
are
most
of
well
i
do
know
about
of
you
and
mac
used
to
talk
a
lot
about
the
of
the
few
i
do
know
but
as
far
as
i
can
see
every
creature
who
comes
up
to
this
country
comes
to
take
something
out
of
it
except
those
holy
cross
fellas
they
came
to
bring
something
the
colonel
had
got
the
blankets
out
now
but
where
was
the
rubber
sheet
he
would
sleep
on
it
in
this
weather
again
for
a
kingdom
but
when
the
thaws
came
if
those
explorer
fellas
were
right
in
his
sense
of
irritation
at
a
conscientious
duty
to
perform
and
no
clear
notion
of
how
to
discharge
it
he
made
believe
it
was
the
difficulty
in
finding
the
rubber
sheet
he
did
want
that
made
him
out
of
sorts
it
bitter
work
anyhow
this
making
beds
with
your
fingers
stiff
and
raw
he
said
is
it
dignity
looked
at
impudence
sitting
in
the
shelter
smiling
humph
just
try
it
growled
the
colonel
i
the
man
over
the
fire
cookin
supper
does
better
off
than
the
pardner
cuttin
down
trees
and
makin
beds
in
the
snow
but
he
is
oh
is
he
it
was
all
right
but
the
big
chimney
boss
felt
he
had
chosen
the
lion
share
of
the
work
in
electing
to
be
woodman
still
it
was
that
troubled
him
now
what
was
it
he
had
been
going
to
say
about
the
jesuits
something
very
telling
if
you
mean
that
you
rather
go
back
to
the
cookin
the
boy
was
saying
agreeable
well
you
start
in
and
see
if
you
so
agreeable
all
right
i
think
i
dote
on
one
job
just
about
as
much
as
i
do
on
but
still
the
colonel
frowned
he
could
remember
that
excellent
thing
he
had
been
going
to
say
about
romanists
but
he
sniffed
derisively
and
flung
over
his
shoulder
to
hear
you
goin
on
anybody
think
the
jesuits
were
the
only
christians
as
if
there
were
others
who
oh
yes
christians
with
gold
shovels
and
winchester
rifles
i
know
but
if
gold
had
been
found
how
many
of
the
army
that
invaded
the
north
how
many
would
be
here
if
it
had
been
for
the
gold
but
all
this
holy
cross
business
would
be
goin
on
just
the
same
as
it
has
done
for
years
and
years
with
a
mighty
tug
the
colonel
dragged
out
the
rubber
blanket
flung
it
down
on
the
snow
and
squared
himself
back
to
the
fire
to
make
short
work
of
such
views
i
no
notion
you
were
such
a
sucker
you
can
bet
he
said
darkly
those
fellas
are
making
a
bad
thing
out
of
that
cross
business
as
you
call
it
i
did
mean
business
in
that
sense
what
else
could
they
do
if
they
did
do
this
ask
the
same
of
any
parson
but
the
colonel
did
care
to
i
suppose
he
said
severely
you
could
even
make
a
hero
out
of
that
brother
etienne
no
but
he
do
something
else
for
he
served
in
the
french
army
then
there
that
mad
brother
paul
what
good
would
he
be
at
anything
else
well
i
do
know
brachet
and
wills
are
decent
enough
men
but
where
else
would
they
have
the
power
and
the
freedom
they
have
at
holy
cross
why
they
live
there
like
feudal
barons
father
richmond
could
have
done
anything
he
chose
ah
father
richmond
the
colonel
shut
his
mouth
suddenly
turned
about
and
proceeded
to
crawl
under
his
blankets
feet
to
the
fire
well
no
answer
well
insisted
the
boy
oh
father
richmond
must
have
seen
a
ghost
take
my
word
for
it
got
frightened
somehow
a
man
like
father
richmond
has
to
be
scared
into
a
cassock
the
boy
sudden
laughter
deepened
the
colonel
own
impression
that
the
instance
chosen
had
not
been
fortunate
one
man
of
courage
knows
another
man
of
courage
when
he
sees
him
and
the
colonel
knew
he
had
damned
his
own
argument
would
care
for
the
job
myself
the
boy
was
saying
what
job
scarin
father
richmond
the
boy
sat
watching
the
slow
wet
fall
and
die
in
the
fire
his
clothes
were
pretty
damp
but
he
was
warm
after
a
chilly
fashion
as
warmth
goes
on
the
trail
the
colonel
suddenly
put
his
head
out
from
under
the
to
say
discontentedly
what
you
sittin
up
for
oh
for
instance
but
aside
from
the
pertness
of
the
answer
already
it
was
dimly
recognised
as
an
offence
for
one
to
stay
up
longer
than
the
other
ca
think
how
it
is
the
colonel
growled
that
you
do
see
that
their
principle
is
wrong
through
and
through
mediaeval
through
and
through
despotic
they
make
a
virtue
of
weakness
a
fetich
of
vested
authority
and
it
is
american
authority
either
the
boy
waited
for
him
to
quiet
down
what
the
first
rule
demanded
the
colonel
half
sitting
up
of
the
most
powerful
catholic
order
blind
obedience
to
an
old
gentleman
over
in
italy
i
said
last
night
you
know
the
boy
put
in
quite
meekly
that
it
all
seemed
very
huh
glad
you
can
see
that
much
the
colonel
drove
his
huge
fist
at
the
as
though
to
beat
the
stiffnecked
beans
into
a
feathery
yielding
blind
submission
do
come
easy
to
most
americans
the
great
republic
was
built
upon
revolt
and
he
pulled
the
covers
over
his
head
i
know
i
know
we
jaw
an
awful
lot
about
freedom
and
about
american
there
plenty
o
free
speech
in
america
and
plenty
machinery
but
there
a
great
deal
o
human
nature
too
i
guess
the
boy
looked
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
at
the
blanketed
back
of
his
big
friend
and
maybe
there
always
be
some
people
who
who
think
there
something
in
the
new
testament
notion
o
sacrifice
and
service
the
colonel
rolled
like
an
angry
leviathan
and
came
to
the
surface
to
blow
but
the
boy
dashed
on
with
a
fearful
joy
in
his
own
temerity
the
difference
between
us
colonel
is
that
i
an
unbeliever
and
i
know
it
and
you
a
cantankerous
old
heathen
and
you
know
it
the
colonel
sat
suddenly
bolt
upright
need
look
at
me
like
that
you
as
bad
as
anybody
rather
worse
why
are
you
dazzled
and
lured
by
the
great
gold
craze
an
you
not
even
poor
you
want
gold
you
got
a
home
to
stay
in
but
you
satisfied
not
even
in
the
fat
lands
down
below
well
said
the
colonel
solemnly
blinking
at
the
fire
i
hope
i
a
christian
but
as
to
bein
satisfied
church
of
england
ca
manage
it
hey
church
of
england
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
a
question
character
satisfied
we
little
enough
god
knows
but
we
too
big
for
that
the
boy
stood
up
back
to
the
fire
eyes
on
the
hilltops
whitening
in
the
starlight
perhaps
not
all
of
us
yes
sah
all
of
us
the
colonel
lifted
his
head
with
a
fierce
look
of
most
pride
behind
him
the
hills
leaving
the
struggling
little
wood
far
down
the
slope
went
up
and
up
into
dimness
reaching
to
the
stars
and
looking
down
to
the
camp
fire
by
the
great
edge
yes
sah
the
colonel
thundered
again
all
that
have
got
good
fightin
blood
in
like
you
and
me
is
as
if
we
came
of
any
frightened
servile
old
stock
you
and
i
belong
to
the
southerners
the
people
before
us
fought
bears
and
fought
indians
and
beat
the
british
and
when
there
was
anything
else
left
to
beat
turned
round
and
began
to
beat
one
another
it
was
the
one
battle
we
found
did
pay
we
finished
that
job
up
in
and
since
then
we
been
lookin
round
for
something
else
to
beat
we
got
down
now
to
beatin
records
and
foreign
markets
and
breedin
prize
bulls
but
we
do
breed
cowards
yet
and
we
ai
lookin
round
for
any
asylums
the
catholic
church
is
an
asylum
it
for
people
who
never
had
any
nerve
or
who
have
lost
it
the
colonel
turned
about
wagged
his
head
defiantly
at
the
icy
hills
and
the
night
and
in
the
fell
sound
asleep
in
the
snow
chapter

the
great
white
silence
paa

innocently
thinking
that
they
had
seen
arctic
travelling
at
its
worst
and
secretly
looking
upon
themselves
as
highly
accomplished
trailmen
they
had
covered
the
miles
from
holy
cross
to
anvik
in
less
than
three
days
the
colonel
made
much
of
the
pleasant
and
excellent
man
at
the
head
of
the
episcopal
mission
there
and
the
boy
haunted
benham
store
picking
up
a
little
ingalik
and
the
method
of
trading
with
the
indians
who
day
and
night
with
a
number
of
stranded
klondykers
congregated
about
the
grateful
warmth
of
the
big
iron
stove
the
travellers
themselves
did
some
business
with
the
agent
laying
in
supplies
of
fresh
meat
and
even
augmenting
their
hitherto
carefully
restricted
outfit
for
they
were
going
far

the
reach
of
stores
or
even
of
missions
anvik
was
the
last
white
settlement
below

nulato
was
said
to
be
over
two
hundred
miles
to
the
northward
and
yet
after
all
their
further
preparation
and
expense
each
man
kept
saying
in
his
heart
during
those
first
days
out
from
anvik
that
the
journey
would
be
easy
enough
but
for
their
comforts
the
burden
on
the
sled
by
all
the
rules
of
arithmetic
the
daily
subtraction
of
three
meals
from
the
store
should
have
lightened
the
load
it
seemed
to
have
the
opposite
effect
by
some
process
of
evil
enchantment
every
ounce
grew
to
weigh
a
pound
every
pound
a
hundredweight
the
sled
itself
was
bewitched
recall
how
lightsomely
it
ran
down
the
snowy
slope
from
the
big
chimney
cabin
to
the
river
trail
that
morning
they
set
forth
the
boy
took
its
pretty
impetuosity
for
a
happy
augury
the
very
sled
was
eager
for
the
mighty
undertaking
but
never
in
all
that
weary
march
did
it
manifest
again
any
such
modest
alacrity
if
thereafter
in
the
long
going
up
river
there
came
an
interval
of
downhill
the
sled
turned
summersaults
in
the
air
wound
its
forward
or
backward
rope
round
willow
scrub
or
alder
or
else
advanced
precipitately
with
an
evil
air
bottom
side
up
to
attack
its
master
in
the
shins
it
either
held
back
with
a
power
superhuman
or
it
lunged
forward
with
a
momentum
that
capsized
its
weary
conductor
its
manners
grew
steadily
worse
as
the
travellers
pushed
farther
and
farther
into
the
wilderness
beyond
the
exorcising
power
of
holy
cross
beyond
the
softening
influences
of
christian
hospitality
at
episcopal
anvik
even
beyond
tischsocket
the
last
of
the
indian
villages
for
a
hundred
miles
the
two
who
had
been
scornful
of
the
frailty
of
temper
they
had
seen
common
in
men
dealings
up
here
in
the
north
began
to
realize
that
all
other
trials
of
brotherhood
pale
before
the
strain
of
life
on
the
arctic
trail
beyond
any
question
after
a
while
something
goes
wrong
with
the
nerves
the
huge
drafts
on
muscular
endurance
have
no
doubt
something
to
do
with
it
they
worked
hard
for
fourteen
sometimes
seventeen
hours
at
a
stretch
they
were
suffering
from
exposure
intense
cold
and
a
haunting
uncertainty
of
the
end
of
the
undertaking
they
were
reasonable
fellows
as
men
go
with
a
respect
for
each
other
but
when
hardship
has
got
on
the
nerves
when
you
are
suffering
the
agonies
of
sore
feet
and
the
pangs
of
hunger
you
are
not
to
put
it
mildly
at
your
best
as
a
member
of
the
social
order
they
sometimes
said
things
they
were
ashamed
to
remember
but
both
men
grew
carefuller
at
crucial
moments
and
the
talkative
one
more
silent
as
time
went
on
by
the
rule
of
the
day
the
hard
shift
before
dinner
usually
fell
to
the
boy
it
was
the
worst
time
in
the
hours
and
equally
dreaded
by
both
men
it
was
only
the
first
night
out
from
anvik
after
an
unusually
trying
day
the
boy
was
tramping
heavily
ahead
bent
like
an
old
man
before
the
cutting
sleet
fettered
like
a
criminal
hands
behind
back
stiff
straining
at
the
burden
of
the
slow
and
sullen
sled
on
a
sudden
he
stopped
straightened
his
back
and
remonstrated
with
the
colonel
in
unprintable
terms
for
putting
off
the
halt
later
than
ever
they
had
yet
after
such
a
day
ca
make
fire
with
green
was
the
colonel
rejoiner
then
let
stop
and
rest
anyhow
nuh
we
know
where
that
would
land
us
men
who
stop
to
rest
go
to
sleep
in
the
snow
and
men
who
go
to
sleep
in
the
snow
on
empty
stomachs
do
wake
up
they
pushed
on
another
mile
when
the
colonel
at
last
called
the
halt
the
boy
sank
down
on
the
sled
too
exhausted
to
speak
but
it
had
grown
to
be
a
practice
with
them
not
to
trust
themselves
to
talk
at
this
hour
the
colonel
would
give
the
signal
to
stop
simply
by
ceasing
to
push
the
sled
that
the
boy
was
wearily
dragging
the
boy
had
invariably
been
feeling
just
as
the
colonel
had
before
during
his
shift
in
front
that
the
man
behind
was
helping
all
he
might
whereupon
followed
a
vague
consciously
unreasonable
but
wholly
irresistible
rage
against
the
partner
of
his
toil
but
however
much
the
man
at
the
back
was
supposed
to
spare
himself
the
man
in
front
had
never
yet
failed
to
know
when
the
impetus
from
behind
was
really
removed
the
boy
sat
now
on
the
sled
silent
motionless
while
the
colonel
felled
and
chopped
and
brought
the
wood
then
the
boy
dragged
himself
up
made
the
fire
and
the
but
still
no
word
even
after
that
reviving
cup
the
usual
signal
for
a
few
remarks
and
more
social
relations
to
be
established
tonight
no
sound
out
of
either
the
colonel
changed
his
footgear
and
the
melted
snow
in
the
pot
began
to
boil
noisily
but
the
boy
who
had
again
betaken
himself
to
the
sled
did
budge
no
man
who
really
knows
the
trail
would
have
dared
under
the
circumstances
to
remind
his
pardner
that
it
was
now
his
business
to
get
up
and
fry
the
bacon
but
presently
without
looking
up
the
hungry
colonel
ventured
get
your
dry
things
feet
are
wet
do
talk
foolishness
here
are
your
things
the
colonel
flung
in
the
boy
direction
the
usual
change
two
pairs
of
heavy
socks
the
german
knitted
and
the
felt
not
wet
repeated
the
boy
you
know
you
are
could
go
through
water
in
these
mucklucks
i
not
saying
the
wet
has
come
in
from
outside
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
a
man
sweats
like
a
horse
on
the
trail
still
the
boy
sat
there
with
his
head
sunk
between
his
shoulders
first
rule
o
this
country
is
to
keep
your
feet
dry
or
else
pneumonia
rheumatism
god
knows
what
first
rule
o
this
country
is
mind
your
own
business
or
else
god
knows
what
the
colonel
looked
at
the
boy
a
moment
and
then
turned
his
back
the
boy
glanced
up
but
still
only
half
alive
dulled
by
the
weight
of
a
crushing
weariness
the
colonel
presently
bent
over
the
fire
and
was
about
to
lift
off
the
turbulently
boiling
pot
the
boy
sprang
to
his
feet
ready
to
shout
you
do
your
work
and
keep
your
hands
off
mine
but
the
colonel
turned
just
in
time
to
say
with
unusual
gentleness
if
you
i
make
supper
and
the
boy
catching
his
breath
ran
forward
swaying
a
little
half
blind
but
with
a
different
look
in
his
tired
eyes
no
no
old
man
it
is
as
bad
as
that
and
again
it
was
two
friends
who
slept
side
by
side
in
the
snow
the
next
morning
the
colonel
who
had
been
kept
awake
half
the
night
by
what
he
had
been
thinking
was
neuralgia
in
his
eyes
woke
late
hearing
the
boy
calling
i
say
kentucky
are
you
goin
to
get
up
get
up
said
the
colonel
why
should
i
when
it
fire
clean
out
eh
but
he
smelt
the
tea
and
bacon
and
sat
up
bewildered
with
a
hand
over
his
smarting
eyes
the
boy
went
over
and
knelt
down
by
him
looking
at
him
curiously
guess
you
a
little
colonel
but
it
wo
last
you
know
blind
no
no
only
big
difference
and
he
took
out
his
rag
of
a
handkerchief
got
some
water
in
a
tin
cup
and
the
eyes
were
bathed
and
bandaged
it
wo
last
you
know
you
just
have
to
take
it
easy
for
a
few
days
the
colonel
groaned
for
the
first
time
he
seemed
to
lose
heart
he
sat
during
breakfast
with
bandaged
eyes
and
a
droop
of
the
shoulders
that
seemed
to
say
old
age
had
come
upon
him
in
a
single
night
the
day
that
followed
was
pretty
dark
to
both
men
the
boy
had
to
do
all
the
work
except
the
monotonous
blind
pushing
from
behind
in
whatever
direction
the
boy
dragged
the
sled
now
is
not
usually
dangerous
but
it
is
horribly
painful
while
it
lasts
your
eyes
swell
up
and
are
stabbed
continually
by
cutting
pains
your
head
seems
full
of
acute
neuralgia
and
often
there
is
fever
and
other
complications
the
colonel
was
a
bad
case
but
he
was
a
giant
for
strength
and
sound
as
a
dollar
as
the
boy
reminded
him
except
for
this
little
bother
with
your
eyes
and
a
whole
heap
better
already
at
a
very
slow
rate
they
plodded
along
they
had
got
into
a
region
where
there
was
no
timber
but
as
they
could
camp
without
a
fire
they
took
an
extra
rest
that
day
at
four
and
regaled
themselves
on
some
cold
grub
then
they
took
up
the
line
of
march
again
but
they
had
been
going
only
about
half
an
hour
when
the
colonel
suddenly
without
warning
stopped
pushing
the
sled
and
stood
on
the
trail
the
boy
feeling
the
removal
of
the
pressure
looked
round
went
back
to
him
and
found
nothing
in
particular
was
the
matter
but
he
just
thought
he
would
go
any
further
we
can
camp
here
no
we
ca
says
the
boy
there
is
a
tree
in
sight
but
the
colonel
seemed
dazed
he
thought
he
stop
anyhow
right
where
he
was
oh
no
says
the
boy
a
little
frightened
we
camp
the
minute
we
come
to
wood
but
the
colonel
stood
as
if
rooted
the
boy
took
his
arm
and
led
him
on
a
few
paces
to
the
sled
you
need
push
hard
you
know
just
keep
your
hand
there
so
without
looking
you
know
where
i
going
this
was
very
subtle
of
the
boy
for
he
knew
the
colonel
was
blind
as
a
bat
and
as
sensitive
as
a
woman
we
get
through
all
right
yet
he
called
back
as
he
stooped
to
take
up
the
sledrope
i
bet
on
kentucky
like
a
man
walking
in
his
sleep
the
colonel
followed
now
holding
on
to
the
sled
and
unconsciously
pulling
a
little
and
when
the
boy
very
nearly
on
his
last
legs
remonstrated
leaning
against
it
and
so
urging
it
a
little
forward
oh
but
the
wood
was
far
to
seek
that
night
concentrated
on
the
two
main
things
to
carry
forward
his
almost
intolerable
load
and
to
go
the
shortest
way
to
the
nearest
wood
the
boy
forgot
to
tell
his
tired
nerves
to
take
account
of
the
unequal
pressure
from
behind
if
he
felt
it
well
the
colonel
was
a
corker
if
he
did
feel
it
well
the
colonel
was
just
about
tuckered
out
it
was
very
late
when
at
last
the
boy
raised
a
shout
behind
the
cliff
overhanging
the
that
they
were
just
rounding
there
spread
out
in
the
sparkling
starlight
as
far
as
he
could
see
a
vast
primeval
forest
the
boy
bettered
his
lagging
pace
ha
you
have
seen
a
wood
like
this
since
we
left
it
all
right
now
kentucky
and
he
bent
to
his
work
with
a
will
when
he
got
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
he
flung
down
the
rope
and
turned
to
find
himself
alone
colonel
colonel
where
are
you
he
stood
in
the
silence
shivering
with
a
sudden
sense
of
desolation
he
took
his
bearings
propped
a
fallen
fir
sapling
aslant
by
the
sled
and
forgetting
he
was
ready
to
drop
he
ran
swiftly
hack
along
the
way
he
came
they
had
travelled
all
that
afternoon
and
evening
on
the
river
ice
hard
as
iron
retaining
no
trace
of
footprint
or
of
runner
possible
to
verify
even
in
daylight
the
yukon
here
was
fully
three
miles
wide
they
had
meant
to
hug
the
right
bank
but
snow
and
ice
refashion
the
world
and
laugh
at
the
trustful
geography
of
men
a
traveller
on
this
trail
is
not
always
sure
whether
he
is
following
the
mighty
yukon
or
some
slough
equally
mighty
for
a
few
miles
or
whether
in
the
protracted
twilight
he
has
not
wandered
off
upon
some
frozen
swamp
on
the
boy
went
in
the
ghostly
starlight
running
stumbling
calling
at
regular
intervals
his
voice
falling
into
a
melancholy
monotony
that
sounded
foreign
to
himself
it
occurred
to
him
that
were
he
the
colonel
he
would
recognise
it
and
he
began
instead
to
call
kentucky
sounding
those
fine
barbaric
syllables
for
the
first
time
most
like
in
that
world
of
ice
and
silence
he
stood
an
instant
after
his
voice
died
and
listened
to
the
quiet
yes
the
people
were
right
who
said
nothing
was
so
hard
to
bear
in
this
country
of
hardship
nothing
ends
by
being
so
ghastly
as
the
silence
no
bird
stirs
the
fish
are
sealed
under
ice
the
wood
creatures
gone
to
their
underground
sleep
no
whispering
of
the
pointed
firs
stiff
snowclotted
no
swaying
of
the
scant
herbage
sheathed
in
ice
or
muffled
under
winter
wide
white
blanket
no
greater
hush
can
reign
in
the
interstellar
spaces
than
in
winter
on
the
yukon
colonel
silence
like
a
negation
of
all
puny
things
friendship
human
life
colonel
silence
no
wonder
men
went
mad
up
here
when
they
did
drown
this
silence
in
strong
drink
on
and
on
he
ran
till
he
felt
sure
he
must
have
passed
the
colonel
unless
yes
there
were
those
in
the
river
ice
he
felt
choked
and
stopped
to
breathe
should
he
go
back
it
was
horrible
to
turn
it
was
like
admitting
that
the
man
was
not
to
be
found
that
this
was
the
end
colonel
he
said
to
himself
that
he
would
go
back
and
build
a
fire
for
a
signal
and
return
but
he
ran
on
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
sled
and
from
the
forest
was
it
growing
faintly
light
he
looked
up
oh
yes
presently
it
would
be
brighter
still
those
streamers
of
pale
light
dancing
in
the
north
they
would
be
green
and
scarlet
and
orange
and
purple
and
the
terrible
white
world
would
be
illumined
as
by
conflagration
he
stopped
again
that
the
colonel
should
have
dropped
so
far
back
as
this
and
the
man
in
front
not
know
it
was
incredible
what
was
that
a
shadow
on
the
ice
a
frozen
hummock
no
a
man
was
it
really
glory
hallelujah
it
but
the
shadow
lay
there
ghastly
still
and
the
boy
greeting
died
in
his
throat
he
had
found
the
colonel
but
he
had
found
him
delivered
over
to
that
treacherous
sleep
that
seldom
knows
a
waking
the
boy
dropped
down
beside
his
friend
and
was
far
off
crying
but
it
was
a
tonic
to
young
nerves
to
see
how
like
one
dead
the
man
lay
there
for
all
the
calling
and
tugging
by
the
arm
the
boy
rolled
the
body
over
pulled
open
the
things
at
the
neck
and
thrust
his
hand
down
till
he
could
feel
the
heart
beating
he
jumped
up
got
a
handful
of
snow
and
rubbed
the
man
face
with
it
at
last
a
feeble
protest
an
effort
to
get
away
from
the
boy
rude
succour
thank
god
colonel
colonel
wake
up
he
shook
him
hard
but
the
big
man
only
growled
sullenly
and
let
his
leaden
weight
drop
back
heavily
on
the
ice
the
boy
got
hold
of
the
neck
of
the
colonel
parki
and
pulled
him
frantically
along
the
ice
a
few
yards
and
then
realised
that
only
the
terror
of
the
moment
gave
him
the
strength
to
do
that
much
to
drag
a
man
of
the
colonel
weight
all
the
way
to
the
wood
was
stark
impossibility
he
could
get
him
eighty
yards
if
he
left
him
and
went
for
the
sled
and
fuel
the
man
would
be
dead
by
the
time
he
got
back
if
he
stayed
they
would
both
be
frozen
in
a
few
hours
it
was
pretty
horrible
he
felt
faint
and
dizzy
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
pray
he
was
an
agnostic
all
right
but
the
colonel
was
past
praying
for
himself
and
here
was
his
friend
an
agnostic
here
he
was
on
his
knees
he
had
prayed
since
he
was
a
little
chap
down
in
the
south
how
did
the
prayers
go
our
father
he
looked
up
at
the
reddening
aurora
our
father
who
art
in
heaven
his
eyes
fell
again
on
his
friend
he
leapt
to
his
feet
like
a
wild
animal
and
began
to
go
at
the
colonel
with
his
fists
the
blows
rained
thick
on
the
chest
of
the
prostrate
man
but
he
was
too
well
protected
to
feel
more
than
the
shock
but
now
they
came
battering
down
under
the
ear
right
left
as
the
man
turned
blindly
to
avoid
them
on
the
jaw
even
on
the
suffering
eyes
and
that
at
last
stung
the
sleeper
into
something
like
consciousness
he
struggled
to
his
feet
with
a
roar
like
a
wounded
bull
lunging
heavily
forward
as
the
boy
eluded
him
and
he
would
have
pounded
the
young
fellow
out
of
existence
in
no
time
had
he
stood
his
ground
that
was
exactly
what
the
boy
did
mean
to
do
he
was
always
just
a
little
way
on
in
front
but
as
the
colonel
rage
cooled
and
he
slowed
down
a
bit
the
boy
was
at
him
again
like
some
imp
of
satan
sound
and
lithe
and
as
he
was
he
was
no
match
for
the
colonel
at
his
best
but
the
colonel
could
see
well
and
his
brain
was
on
fire
he
kill
that
young
devil
and
then
he
lie
down
and
sleep
again
meanwhile
aurora
mounted
the
high
heavens
from
a
great
corona
in
the
zenith
all
the
sky
was
hung
with
banners
and
the
snow
was
stained
as
if
with
blood
the
boy
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
the
huge
figure
of
his
friend
bearing
down
upon
him
with
his
discoloured
face
and
murder
in
his
tortured
eyes
a
moment
sense
of
the
monstrous
spectacle
fell
so
poignant
upon
the
boy
that
he
felt
dimly
he
must
have
been
full
half
his
life
running
this
race
with
death
followed
by
a
maniac
bent
on
murder
in
a
world
whose
winter
was
strangely
lit
with
the
leaping
fires
of
hell
at
last
on
there
in
front
the
cliff
below
it
the
sharp
bend
in
the
river
and
although
he
could
see
it
yet
behind
the
cliff
the
forest
and
a
little
bearing
the
means
of
life
the
colonel
was
down
again
but
it
was
safe
to
go
near
him
just
yet
the
boy
ran
on
unpacked
the
sled
and
went
axe
in
hand
along
the
margin
of
the
wood
never
before
was
a
fire
made
so
quickly
then
with
the
flask
back
to
the
colonel
almost
as
sound
asleep
as
before
the
boy
never
could
recall
much
about
the
hours
that
followed
there
was
nobody
to
help
so
it
must
have
been
he
who
somehow
got
the
colonel
to
the
fire
got
him
to
swallow
some
food
plastered
his
wounded
face
over
with
the
carbolic
ointment
and
got
him
into
bed
for
in
the
morning
all
this
was
seen
to
have
been
done
they
stayed
in
camp
that
day
to
rest
up
and
the
boy
shot
a
rabbit
the
colonel
was
coming
round
the
rest
or
the
ointment
or
the
poultice
had
been
good
for
snowblindness
the
generous
reserve
of
strength
in
his
magnificent
physique
was
quick
to
announce
itself
he
was
still
frightfully
bunged
up
but
i
think
we
push
on
he
said
that
night
as
he
sat
by
the
fire
smoking
before
turning
in
right
you
are
said
the
boy
who
was
mending
the
neither
had
referred
to
that
encounter
on
the
that
had
ended
in
bringing
the
colonel
where
there
was
succour
nothing
was
said
then
or
for
long
after
in
the
way
of
deliberate
recognition
that
the
boy
had
saved
his
life
it
was
necessary
they
understood
each
other
but
in
the
evening
after
the
boy
had
finished
mending
the
sled
it
occurred
to
him
he
must
also
mend
the
colonel
before
they
went
to
bed
he
got
out
the
box
of
ointment
and
bespread
the
strips
of
torn
handkerchief
do
know
as
i
need
that
says
the
colonel
mus
waste
ointment
but
the
boy
brought
the
bandages
round
to
the
side
of
the
fire
for
an
instant
they
looked
at
each
other
by
the
flickering
light
and
the
colonel
laid
his
hand
on
the
boy
arm
his
eyes
looked
worse
for
the
moment
and
began
to
water
he
turned
away
brusquely
and
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
on
a
log
what
in
hell
made
you
think
of
it
ask
me
an
easy
one
says
the
boy
but
i
know
what
the
jesuit
fathers
would
say
jesuits
and
george
warren
humph
precious
little
we
agree
about
you
would
about
this
it
flashed
over
me
when
i
looked
back
and
saw
you
peltin
after
me
small
wonder
i
made
for
you
i
not
findin
fault
but
what
on
earth
put
it
into
your
head
to
go
at
me
with
your
fists
like
that
you
never
prove
it
by
me
but
when
i
saw
you
comin
at
me
like
a
mad
bull
i
thought
to
myself
thinks
i
the
colonel
and
the
jesuits
they
both
of
say
this
was
a
direct
answer
to
prayer

an
old
story
now
these
days
of
silent
plodding
through
the
driving
snow
but
if
outward
conditions
lacked
variety
not
so
their
cumulative
effect
upon
poor
human
nature
a
change
was
going
on
in
the
travellers
that
will
little
commend
them
to
the
sentimentalist
i
come
to
think
a
all
right
to
travel
in
all
right
to
sleep
in
said
the
colonel
one
morning
but
to
cook
in
eat
in
make
or
break
camp
in
it
the
devil
champion
invention
for
three
days
they
had
worked
like
and
yet
covered
less
than
ten
miles
a
day
and
you
never
get
rested
the
colonel
went
on
i
get
up
as
tired
as
i
go
to
bed
again
the
boy
only
nodded
his
body
if
not
his
temper
had
got
broken
into
the
trail
but
for
a
talkative
person
he
had
in
these
days
strangely
little
to
say
it
became
manifest
that
in
the
long
run
the
colonel
would
suffer
the
most
physically
but
his
young
companion
having
less
patience
and
more
ambition
more
sheer
untamed
vitality
in
him
would
suffer
the
most
in
spirit
every
sense
in
him
was
becoming
numbed
save
the
gnawing
in
his
stomach
and
that
other
even
more
acute
ache
queer
compound
of
fatigue
and
anger
these
two
sensations
swallowed
up
all
else
and
seemed
to
grow
by
what
they
fed
on
the
loaded
sled
was
a
nightmare
it
weighed
a
thousand
tons
the
very
first
afternoon
out
from
anvik
when
in
the
desperate
hauling
and
tugging
that
rescued
it
from
a
bottomless
the
lashing
slipped
the
load
loosened
tumbled
off
and
rolled
open
the
colonel
stood
quite
still
and
swore
till
his
blood
circulated
freely
again
when
it
came
to
repacking
he
considered
in
detail
the
items
that
made
up
the
intolerable
weight
and
fell
to
wondering
which
of
them
they
could
do
without
the
second
day
out
from
anvik
they
had
decided
that
it
was
absurd
after
all
to
lug
about
so
much
tinware
they
left
a
little
saucepan
and
the
extra
kettle
at
that
camp
the
idea
so
potent
at
anvik
of
having
a
in
reserve
well
the
notion
lost
weight
and
the
kettle
seemed
to
gain
two
pairs
of
boots
and
some
flannels
marked
the
next
on
the
following
day
when
the
boy
rifle
kept
slipping
and
making
a
brake
to
hold
back
the
sled
i
reckon
you
have
to
plant
that
rifle
o
yours
in
the
next
big
drift
said
the
colonel
one
all
we
need
anyway
one
all
you
need
and
one
all
i
need
answered
the
boy
stiffly
but
it
was
easy
to
see
immediate
need
for
either
never
was
country
so
bare
of
game
they
thought
not
considering
how
little
they
hunted
and
how
more
and
more
every
faculty
every
sense
was
absorbed
in
the
bare
going
forward
the
next
time
the
colonel
said
something
about
the
uselessness
of
carrying
two
guns
the
boy
flared
up
if
you
object
to
guns
leave
yours
this
was
a
new
tone
for
the
boy
to
use
to
the
colonel
do
you
think
we
better
hold
on
to
the
best
one
now
the
boy
could
deny
that
the
colonel
was
the
better
but
none
the
less
he
had
a
great
affection
for
his
own
old
marlin
and
the
colonel
should
assume
that
he
had
the
right
to
dictate
this
attitude
of
the
wise
elder
seemed
out
of
place
on
the
trail
a
gun
a
necessity
i
have
brought
along
any
who
has
well
it
was
me
that
went
loadin
up
at
anvik
with
fool
thermometers
and
things
thermometer
why
it
does
weigh
weighs
something
and
it
something
to
pack
frozen
half
the
time
too
and
when
it
is
what
the
good
of
havin
it
hammered
into
us
how
near
we
are
to
freezin
to
death
but
it
annoyed
him
to
think
how
very
little
in
argument
a
thermometer
weighed
against
a
rifle
they
said
no
more
that
day
about
lightening
the
load
but
with
a
double
motive
they
made
enormous
inroads
upon
their
provisions
a
morning
came
when
the
colonel
packing
hurriedly
in
the
biting
cold
forgot
to
shove
his
pardner
gun
into
its
accustomed
place
the
boy
returning
from
to
the
river
kicked
at
the
butt
to
draw
attention
to
the
omission
the
colonel
flung
down
the
end
of
the
rope
he
had
lashed
the
load
with
and
pack
it
yourself
says
he
the
boy
let
the
rifle
lie
but
all
day
long
he
felt
the
loss
of
it
heavy
on
his
heart
and
no
reconciling
lightness
in
the
sled
the
colonel
began
to
have
qualms
about
the
double
rations
they
were
using
it
was
only
the
seventeenth
night
after
turning
their
backs
on
the
big
chimney
as
the
colonel
tipped
the
pan
pouring
out
half
the
boiled
beans
into
his
pardner
plate
that
the
last
o
the
strawberries
do
go
expectin
any
more
says
he
what
ejaculated
the
boy
aghast
then
quickly
to
keep
a
good
face
you
take
my
life
when
you
do
take
the
beans
whereby
i
live
when
the
colonel
had
disposed
of
his
strawberries
lord
he
sighed
trying
to
rub
the
stiffness
out
of
his
hands
over
the
smoke
the
appetite
a
fella
can
raise
up
here
is
something
terrible
you
eat
and
eat
and
it
does
seem
to
make
any
impression
you
just
as
hungry
as
ever
and
the
stuff
a
fella
can
eat
the
colonel
recalled
that
speech
of
the
boy
the
very
next
night
when
after
a
hell
of
a
time
getting
the
fire
alight
he
was
bending
forward
in
that
attitude
most
trying
to
maintain
holding
the
at
long
range
over
the
sticks
he
had
to
cook
to
live
on
nowadays
for
the
heavy
colonel
had
illustrated
oftener
than
the
boy
that
going
without
meant
breaking
in
floundering
and
finally
having
to
call
for
your
pardner
to
haul
you
out
this
was
one
of
the
many
uses
of
a
pardner
on
the
trail
the
last
time
the
colonel
had
trusted
to
the
treacherous
crust
he
had
gone
in
head
foremost
and
the
boy
happening
to
look
round
saw
only
two
bottom
side
up
moving
spasmodically
on
the
surface
of
the
drift
the
colonel
was
nearly
suffocated
by
the
time
he
was
pulled
out
and
after
that
he
stuck
to
every
hour
of
the
except
those
spent
in
the
but
few
things
on
earth
are
more
exasperating
than
trying
to
work
mounted
on
clumsy
long
that
keep
jarring
against
yet
holding
you
off
from
the
tree
you
are
felling
or
the
fire
you
are
cooking
over
you
are
constrained
to
stand
wholly
out
of
natural
relation
to
the
thing
you
are
trying
to
do
the
thing
you
got
to
do
if
you
mean
to
come
out
alive
the
colonel
had
been
through
all
this
time
and
time
again
but
as
he
squatted
on
his
heels
cursing
the
foot
and
a
half
of
that
held
him
away
from
the
sullen
fire
straining
every
muscle
to
keep
the
outstretched
over
the
best
of
the
blaze
he
said
to
himself
that
what
had
got
him
on
the
raw
was
that
speech
of
the
boy
yesterday
about
the
stuff
he
had
to
eat
if
the
boy
objected
to
having
his
rice
parboiled
in
smoked
water
he
was
damned
unreasonable
that
was
all
the
culprit
reappeared
at
the
edge
of
the
darkening
wood
he
came
up
eagerly
and
flung
down
an
armful
of
fuel
for
the
morning
hoping
to
find
supper
ready
since
it
was
he
knew
that
he
must
stand
about
and
watch
the
preparations
by
this
time
he
had
learned
a
good
deal
of
the
unwritten
law
on
no
account
must
you
hint
that
the
cook
is
incompetent
or
even
slow
any
more
than
he
may
find
fault
with
your
moment
for
calling
halt
or
with
your
choice
of
timber
so
the
woodman
turned
wearily
away
from
the
sole
spot
of
brightness
in
the
waste
and
went
back
up
the
hill
in
the
dark
and
the
cold
to
busy
himself
about
his
own
work
even
to
spin
it
out
if
necessary
till
he
should
hear
the
gruff
grub
ready
and
when
that
sounds
do
you
dally
do
you
wait
a
second
you
may
feel
uncomfortable
if
you
find
yourself
twenty
minutes
late
for
a
dinner
in
london
or
new
york
but
to
be
five
minutes
late
for
dinner
on
the
winter
trail
is
to
lay
up
lasting
trouble
by
the
time
the
rice
and
bacon
were
done
and
the
still
raw
in
the
middle
was
burnt
to
charcoal
on
both
sides
the
colonel
eyes
were
smarting
in
the
acrid
smoke
and
the
tears
were
running
down
his
cheeks
grub
ready
the
boy
came
up
and
dropped
on
his
heels
in
the
usual
attitude
the
colonel
tore
a
piece
off
the
pancake
maybe
you
think
the
fire
is
thoroughly
distributed
but
to
do
for
bread
he
remarked
severely
as
if
in
reply
to
some
objection
the
boy
saw
that
something
he
had
said
or
looked
had
been
misinterpreted
hey
too
much
fire
outside
and
not
enough
in
well
sir
i
trust
stomach
to
strike
a
balance
guess
the
heat
get
distributed
all
right
once
i
swallowed
it
when
the
colonel
mollified
said
something
about
cinders
in
the
rice
the
boy
with
his
mouth
full
of
grit
answered
i
pretendin
sugar
not
since
the
episode
of
the
abandoned
rifle
had
he
shown
himself
so
genial
never
in
all
my
bohn
life
says
the
colonel
after
eating
steadily
for
some
time
never
in
a
year
sah
have
i
thought
as
much
about
food
as
i
do
in
a
day
on
this
trail
same
here
and
it
quantity
not
quality
ditto
the
boy
turned
his
head
sharply
away
from
the
fire
hear
that
no
need
to
ask
the
colonel
had
risen
upright
on
his
cramped
legs
red
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
the
boy
got
up
turned
about
in
the
direction
of
the
hollow
sound
and
made
one
step
away
from
the
fire
you
stay
right
where
you
are
ordered
the
colonel
quite
in
the
old
way
hey
that
a
thought
so
wolf
smelt
the
cookin
want
the
rest
of
the
pack
to
know
there
something
queer
up
here
on
the
hill
then
as
the
boy
moved
to
one
side
in
the
dark
what
you
lookin
for
my
gun
mine
here
oh
yes
his
own
old
marlin
was
lying
far
down
the
river
under
hours
of
snow
it
angered
him
newly
and
more
than
ever
to
remember
that
if
he
had
a
shot
at
anything
now
it
must
needs
be
by
favour
of
the
colonel
they
listened
for
that
sound
again
the
first
since
leaving
anvik
not
made
by
themselves
seems
a
lot
quieter
than
it
did
observed
the
colonel
the
boy
nodded
without
preface
the
colonel
observed
it
five
days
since
i
washed
my
face
and
hands
what
the
good
o
rememberin
returned
the
boy
sharply
then
more
mildly
people
talk
about
the
bare
necessaries
o
life
well
sir
when
they
really
bare
you
find
there
ai
but
three
food
warmth
sleep
again
in
the
distance
that
hollow
baying
food
warmth
sleep
repeated
the
colonel
we
about
got
down
to
the
wolf
basis
he
said
it
half
in
defiance
of
the
trail
fierce
lessoning
but
it
was
truer
than
he
knew
they
built
up
the
fire
to
frighten
off
the
wolves
but
the
colonel
had
his
rifle
along
when
they
went
over
and
crawled
into
their
half
in
half
out
he
laid
the
gun
carefully
along
the
right
on
his
as
the
boy
buttoned
the
flap
down
over
their
heads
he
felt
angrier
with
the
colonel
than
he
had
ever
been
before
took
good
care
to
hang
on
to
his
own
suppose
anything
should
happen
and
he
said
it
over
and
over
exactly
what
could
happen
he
did
not
make
clear
the
real
danger
was
not
from
wolves
but
it
was
and
he
would
need
a
rifle
and
he
would
have
one
and
it
was
the
colonel
fault
now
it
had
long
been
understood
that
the
woodman
is
lord
of
the
wood
when
it
came
to
the
colonel
giving
unasked
advice
about
the
lumber
business
the
boy
turned
a
deaf
ear
and
thought
well
of
himself
for
not
openly
resenting
the
interference
the
colonel
talks
an
awful
lot
anyway
he
has
more
hot
air
to
offer
than
muscle
when
they
sighted
timber
that
commended
itself
to
the
woodman
if
thought
well
of
it
why
he
just
dropped
the
without
a
word
pulled
the
axe
out
of
the
lashing
trudged
up
the
hillside
holding
the
axe
against
his
shirt
underneath
his
parki
till
he
reached
whatever
tree
his
eye
had
marked
for
his
own
off
with
the
fur
mitt
and
bare
hand
protected
by
the
inner
mitt
of
wool
he
would
feel
the
for
there
was
always
the
danger
of
using
it
so
cold
that
the
steel
would
chip
and
fly
as
soon
as
he
could
be
sure
the
proper
molecular
change
had
been
effected
he
would
take
up
his
awkward
attitude
before
the
selected
spruce
leaning
far
forward
on
his
and
seeming
to
deliver
the
blows
on
but
the
real
trouble
came
when
after
felling
the
dead
tree
splitting
an
armful
of
fuel
and
carrying
it
to
the
colonel
he
returned
to
the
task
of
cutting
down
the
tough
green
spruce
for
their
bedding
many
strained
blows
must
be
delivered
before
he
could
effect
the
chopping
of
even
a
little
notch
then
he
would
shift
his
position
and
cut
a
corresponding
notch
further
round
so
making
painful
circuit
of
the
bole
what
with
being
held
off
by
his
what
with
utter
weariness
and
a
dulled
axe
he
growled
to
himself
that
he
was
only
gnawin
a
ring
round
the
tree
like
a
beaver
damn
the
whole
wait
perhaps
the
cursed
snow
was
packed
enough
now
to
bear
he
slipped
off
the
and
standing
gingerly
but
blessedly
near
made
effectual
attack
hooray
one
more
good
and
the
thing
was
down
hah
ugh
the
tree
was
down
but
so
was
he
floundering
breast
high
and
at
every
effort
to
get
out
only
breaking
down
more
of
the
crust
and
sinking
deeper
this
was
not
the
first
time
such
a
thing
had
happened
why
did
he
feel
as
if
it
was
for
him
the
end
of
the
world
he
lay
still
an
instant
it
would
be
happiness
just
to
rest
here
and
go
to
sleep
the
colonel
oh
well
the
colonel
had
taken
his
rifle
funny
there
should
be
up
here
he
could
smell
them
he
shut
his
eyes
something
shone
red
and
glowing
why
that
was
the
sun
making
an
effect
of
stained
glass
as
it
shone
through
the
fat
pine
of
his
little
bedroom
on
the
old
place
down
in
florida
suddenly
a
face
that
face
he
must
be
up
and
doing
he
knew
perfectly
well
how
to
get
out
of
this
damn
hole
you
lie
on
your
side
and
roll
gradually
you
pack
the
softness
tight
till
it
bears
not
if
you
stand
up
on
your
feet
but
bears
the
length
of
your
body
while
you
worm
your
way
obliquely
to
the
top
and
feel
gingerly
in
the
dimness
after
your
but
if
it
happens
on
a
night
and
your
pardner
has
chosen
camp
out
of
earshot
you
feel
that
you
have
looked
close
at
the
end
of
the
long
trail
on
getting
back
to
the
fire
he
found
the
colonel
annoyed
at
having
called
grub
three
times
yes
sah
three
times
sah
and
they
ate
in
silence
now
i
going
to
bed
said
the
boy
rising
stiffly
you
just
wait
a
minute
no
now
the
colonel
himself
had
enunciated
the
law
that
whenever
one
of
them
was
ready
to
sleep
the
other
must
come
too
he
did
know
it
but
it
is
one
of
the
iron
rules
of
the
winter
trail
in
absence
of
its
enforcement
the
later
comer
brings
into
the
warmed
up
not
only
the
chill
of
his
own
body
he
lets
in
the
bitter
wind
and
brings
along
whatever
snow
and
ice
is
clinging
to
his
boots
and
clothes
the
melting
and
is
all
to
be
done
again
but
the
colonel
was
angry
most
unreasonable
he
muttered
damned
unreasonable
worse
than
the
ice
and
the
wet
in
the
was
this
lying
in
such
close
proximity
to
a
young
jackanapes
who
would
come
when
you
called
grub
and
would
wait
a
second
till
you
felt
about
in
the
dimness
for
your
gun
hideous
to
lie
so
close
to
a
man
who
snored
and
who
deprived
you
of
your
marlin
although
it
meant
life
the
boy
grudged
the
mere
animal
heat
that
he
gave
and
that
he
took
full
of
grudging
he
dropped
asleep
but
the
waking
spirit
followed
him
into
his
dreams
an
ugly
picture
painted
itself
upon
the
dark
and
struggling
against
the
vision
he
half
awoke
with
the
first
returning
consciousness
came
the
oppression
of
the
yoke
the
impulse
to
match
the
mental
alienation
with
that
of
the
body
strong
need
to
move
away
you
ca
move
away
in
a
in
a
city
you
may
be
alone
free
on
the
trail
you
walk
in
bonds
with
your
make
your
bed
with
him
with
him
rise
up
and
with
him
face
the
lash
the
livelong
day
well
sighed
the
colonel
after
toiling
onward
for
a
couple
of
hours
the
next
morning
this
is
the
worst
yet
but
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
what
did
i
say
why
this
morning
up
till
now
has
been
child
play
he
kept
looking
at
the
boy
to
see
if
he
could
read
any
sign
of
halt
in
the
tense
scarred
face
certainly
the
wind
was
worse
the
going
was
worse
the
sled
kept
breaking
through
and
sinking
to
the
level
of
the
load
there
it
went
in
again
they
tugged
and
hauled
and
only
dragged
the
lashing
loose
while
the
sled
seemed
soldered
to
the
middle
of
the
drift
as
they
reloaded
the
thermometer
came
to
light
the
colonel
threw
it
out
with
never
a
word
they
had
no
clothes
now
but
what
they
stood
in
and
only
one
thing
on
the
sled
they
could
have
lived
without
their
money
a
packet
of
trading
stores
but
they
had
thrown
away
more
than
they
knew
day
by
day
not
flannels
and
boots
alone
not
merely
extra
kettle
thermometer
and
gun
went
overboard
but
some
grace
of
courtesy
some
decency
of
life
had
been
left
behind
about
three
of
this
same
day
dim
with
snow
and
dizzy
in
a
hurricane
of
wind
we
ca
go
on
like
this
said
the
boy
suddenly
wish
i
knew
the
way
we
go
on
returned
the
colonel
stopping
with
an
air
of
utter
helplessness
and
forcing
his
rigid
hands
into
his
pockets
the
boy
looked
at
him
the
man
of
dignity
and
resource
who
had
been
the
boss
of
the
big
chimney
camp
what
had
become
of
him
here
was
only
a
big
slouching
creature
with
ragged
beard
countenance
and
eyes
that
wept
continually
come
on
said
his
equally
pardner
we
both
go
ahead
so
they
abandoned
their
sled
for
awhile
and
when
they
had
forged
a
way
came
back
and
one
pulling
the
other
pushing
lifting
guiding
between
them
with
infinite
pains
they
got
their
burden
to
the
end
of
the
beaten
track
left
it
and
went
ahead
again
travelling
three
miles
to
make
one
what
the
matter
now
the
boy
was
too
tired
to
turn
his
head
round
and
look
back
but
he
knew
that
the
other
man
was
doing
his
share
he
remembered
that
other
time
when
the
colonel
had
fallen
behind
it
seemed
years
ago
and
even
further
away
was
the
vague
recollection
of
how
he
cared
how
horribly
frightened
he
been
was
he
frightened
now
no
it
was
only
a
dull
curiosity
that
turned
him
round
at
last
to
see
what
it
was
that
made
the
colonel
peg
out
this
time
he
was
always
peggin
out
yes
there
he
was
stoppin
to
stroke
himself
an
old
woman
fit
only
for
the
and
even
when
they
went
on
again
he
kept
saying
to
himself
as
he
bent
to
the
galling
strain
an
old
woman
just
an
old
woman
till
he
made
a
refrain
of
the
words
and
in
the
level
places
marched
to
the
tune
after
that
whatever
else
his
vague
thought
went
off
upon
it
came
back
to
an
old
woman
just
an
old
woman
it
was
at
a
bad
place
towards
the
end
of
that
forced
march
that
the
colonel
instead
of
lifting
the
back
of
the
sled
bore
hard
on
the
with
a
vicious
sound
it
snapped
the
boy
turned
heavily
at
the
noise
when
he
saw
the
colonel
standing
dazed
with
the
splintered
bar
in
his
hand
his
dull
eyes
flashed
with
sudden
vigour
he
ran
back
to
see
the
extent
of
the
damage
well
it
pretty
discouragin
says
the
colonel
very
low
the
boy
gritted
his
teeth
with
suppressed
rage
it
was
only
a
chance
that
it
had
happened
when
he
himself
was
behind
but
he
could
see
that
no
it
was
the
colonel
bungling
tryin
to
spare
himself
leanin
on
the
bar
instead
o
liftin
the
sled
as
he
the
boy
would
have
done
with
stiff
hands
they
tried
to
improvise
a
makeshift
with
a
stick
of
birch
and
some
string
do
know
what
you
think
says
the
colonel
presently
but
i
call
this
a
desperate
business
we
undertaken
the
boy
did
trust
himself
to
call
it
anything
with
a
bungled
job
they
went
lamely
on
the
loose
snow
was
whirling
about
so
it
was
impossible
to
say
whether
it
was
still
falling
or
only
to
the
colonel
great
indignation
it
was
later
than
usual
before
they
camped
not
a
word
was
spoken
by
either
till
they
had
finished
their
first
meal
and
the
colonel
had
melted
a
full
of
snow
preparatory
to
the
second
he
took
up
the
held
it
by
the
top
and
ran
his
mittened
hand
down
the
gathered
sack
till
he
had
outlined
the
contents
at
the
bottom
lord
that
all
there
is
the
boy
only
blinked
his
eyes
the
change
in
him
from
talkativeness
to
utter
silence
had
grown
horribly
oppressive
to
the
colonel
he
often
felt
he
like
to
shake
him
till
he
shook
some
words
out
i
told
you
days
ago
he
went
on
that
we
ought
to
go
on
rations
silence
but
no
you
knew
so
much
better
the
boy
shut
his
eyes
and
suddenly
like
one
struggling
against
sleep
or
swooning
he
roused
himself
i
thought
i
knew
the
more
we
took
off
the
damn
sled
the
lighter
be
is
so
and
we
did
either
of
us
think
we
come
down
from
eighteen
miles
a
day
to
six
returned
the
colonel
a
little
mollified
by
any
sort
of
answer
i
do
believe
we
going
to
put
this
job
through
now
this
was
treason
any
may
think
that
twenty
times
a
day
but
no
one
ought
to
say
it
the
boy
set
his
teeth
and
his
eyes
closed
the
whole
thing
was
suddenly
harder
doubt
of
the
issue
had
been
born
into
the
world
but
he
opened
his
eyes
again
the
colonel
had
carefully
poured
some
of
the
rice
into
the
smoky
water
of
the
pan
what
was
the
fool
doing
such
a
little
left
and
making
a
second
supper
only
that
morning
the
boy
had
gone
a
long
way
when
mentally
he
called
the
boss
of
the
big
chimney
camp
an
old
woman
by
night
he
was
saying
in
his
heart
the
colonel
a
fool
his
pardner
caught
the
look
that
matched
the
thought
no
more
second
helpin
he
said
in
this
freeze
into
cakes
for
luncheon
no
answer
no
implied
apology
for
that
look
in
the
tone
his
pardner
had
come
to
dread
the
colonel
began
if
we
do
strike
a
settlement
do
the
boy
tired
arm
fell
on
the
handle
of
the
over
it
went
rice
water
and
all
in
the
fire
the
culprit
sprang
up
speechless
with
dismay
enraged
at
the
loss
of
the
food
he
was
hungry
for
enraged
at
the
fool
enraged
at
the
fool
colonel
for
balancing
it
so
badly
a
column
of
steam
and
smoke
rose
into
the
frosty
air
between
the
two
men
as
it
cleared
away
a
little
the
boy
could
see
the
bloodshot
eyes
the
expression
was
ill
to
meet
when
they
crouched
down
again
with
the
fire
between
them
a
sense
of
utter
loneliness
fell
upon
each
man
heart
the
next
morning
when
they
came
to
digging
the
sled
out
of
the
last
night
the
boy
found
to
his
horror
that
he
was
weaker
yes
a
good
deal
as
they
went
on
he
kept
stumbling
the
colonel
fell
every
now
and
then
sometimes
he
would
lie
still
before
he
could
pull
himself
on
his
legs
again
in
these
hours
they
saw
nothing
of
the
grim
and
splendid
waste
nothing
of
the
ranks
of
trees
nothing
of
sun
course
or
of
stars
only
the
of
dazzling
trail
in
front
of
them
and
clairvoyant
the
little
store
of
flour
and
bacon
that
seemed
to
shrink
in
the
pack
while
they
dragged
it
on
apart
from
partial
which
fell
at
intervals
upon
the
colonel
the
tiredness
of
the
eyes
was
like
a
special
sickness
upon
them
both
for
many
hours
together
they
never
raised
their
lids
looking
out
through
slits
on
the
world
they
had
not
spoken
to
each
other
for
many
days
or
was
it
only
hours
when
the
colonel
looking
at
the
boy
said
you
got
to
have
a
those
frostbites
are
eating
in
so
you
ought
to
stop
it
make
a
guard
out
of
a
or
chunk
o
ice
cut
a
piece
out
o
the
canvas
o
the
bag
but
he
did
the
big
sores
seemed
such
small
matters
beside
the
vast
overshadowing
doubt
shall
we
come
out
of
this
alive
doubt
never
to
be
openly
admitted
by
him
but
always
knocking
knocking
you
ca
see
your
own
face
the
colonel
persisted
one
piece
o
luck
anyhow
the
old
habit
of
looking
after
the
boy
died
hard
the
colonel
hesitated
for
the
last
time
he
would
remonstrate
i
used
to
think
was
a
figure
o
speech
said
he
but
the
teeth
were
set
in
face
sonny
and
they
bitten
deep
they
leave
awful
scars
battles
do
i
and
it
was
with
an
effort
that
he
remembered
there
had
been
a
time
when
they
had
been
uncomfortable
because
they
had
washed
their
faces
now
one
man
was
content
to
let
the
very
skin
go
if
he
could
keep
the
flesh
on
his
face
and
one
was
little
concerned
even
for
that
life
life
to
push
on
and
come
out
alive
the
colonel
had
come
to
that
point
where
he
resented
the
boy
staying
power
terrified
at
the
indomitable
young
life
in
him
yes
the
colonel
began
to
feel
old
and
to
think
with
vague
wrath
of
the
insolence
of
youth
each
man
fell
to
considering
what
he
would
do
how
he
would
manage
if
he
were
alone
and
there
ceased
to
be
any
terror
in
the
thought
if
it
was
for
him
so
and
so
till
in
the
gradual
deadening
of
judgment
all
the
hardship
was
somehow
your
pardner
fault
your
nerves
made
him
responsible
even
for
the
snow
and
the
wind
he
was
the
enemy
not
but
what
each
had
occasional
moments
of
lucidity
and
drew
back
from
the
pit
they
were
bending
over
but
the
realisation
would
fade
no
longer
did
even
the
wiser
of
the
two
remember
that
this
is
that
same
abyss
out
of
which
slowly
painfully
the
race
has
climbed
with
the
lessened
power
to
keep
from
falling
in
the
terror
of
it
lessened
many
strange
things
grew
natural
it
was
no
longer
difficult
or
even
shocking
to
conceive
one
partner
giving
out
and
falling
by
the
way
although
playing
about
the
thought
the
one
thing
that
not
even
the
colonel
was
able
actually
to
realise
was
the
imminent
probability
of
death
for
himself
imagination
always
pictured
the
other
fellow
down
one
self
somehow
forging
ahead
this
obsession
ended
on
the
late
afternoon
when
the
colonel
broke
silence
by
saying
suddenly
we
must
camp
i
done
he
flung
himself
down
under
a
bare
birch
and
hid
his
face
the
boy
remonstrated
grew
angry
then
with
a
huge
effort
at
pointed
out
that
since
it
had
stopped
snowing
this
was
the
very
moment
to
go
on
why
you
can
see
the
sun
three
of
look
colonel
but
arctic
meteorological
phenomena
had
long
since
ceased
to
interest
the
kentuckian
parhelia
were
less
to
him
than
covered
eyes
and
the
perilous
peace
of
the
snow
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
he
sat
up
and
began
to
beat
the
stiffness
out
of
his
hands
against
his
breast
but
when
he
spoke
it
was
only
to
say
i
mean
to
camp
for
how
long
till
a
team
comes
by
or
something
the
boy
got
up
abruptly
slipped
on
his
and
went
round
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
and
up
on
to
the
promontory
to
get
out
of
earshot
of
that
voice
and
determine
which
of
the
two
stretching
out
before
them
was
main
channel
and
which
was
tributary
he
found
on
the
height
only
a
cutting
wind
and
little
enlightenment
as
to
the
true
course
north
and
east
all
nimbus
still
a
brace
of
following
the
pale
god
of
day
across
the
narrow
field
of
primrose
that
bordered
the
west
there
would
be
more
snow
and
meanwhile
the
wind
was
rising
again
yes
sir
it
was
a
mean
outlook
as
he
took
mac
aneroid
barometer
out
of
his
pocket
a
sudden
gust
cut
across
his
raw
and
bleeding
cheek
he
turned
abruptly
the
barometer
slipped
out
of
his
numb
fingers
he
made
a
lunge
to
recover
it
clutched
the
air
and
sliding
suddenly
forward
over
he
went
flying
headlong
down
the
steep
escarpment
he
struck
a
jutting
rock
only
half
snowed
under
that
broke
the
sheer
face
of
the
promontory
and
he
bounded
once
like
a
rubber
ball
struck
a
second
time
caught
desperately
at
a
solitary
clump
of
alders
crashed
through
the
just
below
them
and
was
held
there
like
a
mudlark
in
its
cliff
nest
halfway
between
bluff
and
river
his
last
clear
thought
had
been
an
intense
anxiety
about
his
as
they
sailed
away
two
liberated
kites
but
as
he
went
on
falling
clutching
at
the
air
falling
and
felt
the
alder
twigs
snap
under
his
hands
he
said
to
himself
this
is
death
but
calmly
as
if
it
were
a
small
matter
compared
to
losing
one
it
was
only
when
he
landed
in
the
snow
that
he
was
conscious
of
any
of
the
supposed
natural
excitement
of
a
man
meeting
a
violent
end
it
was
then
before
he
even
got
his
breath
back
that
he
began
to
struggle
frantically
to
get
a
foothold
but
he
only
broke
down
more
of
the
thin
that
kept
him
from
the
sheer
drop
to
the
river
sixty
or
seventy
feet
below
he
lay
quite
still
would
the
colonel
come
after
him
if
he
did
come
would
he
risk
his
life
to
if
he
did
risk
his
life
was
it
any
use
to
try
to
he
craned
his
neck
and
looked
up
blinked
shut
his
eyes
and
lay
back
in
the
snow
with
a
sound
of
singing
in
his
head
any
use
no
sir
it
just
about
was
that
bluff
face
would
be
easier
to
climb
up
than
to
climb
down
and
either
was
impossible
then
it
was
that
a
great
tide
of
longing
swept
over
him
a
flood
of
passionate
desire
for
more
of
this
doubtful
blessing
life
all
the
bitter
hardship
why
how
sweet
it
was
after
all
to
battle
and
to
overcome
it
was
only
this
lying
helpless
trapped
that
was
evil
the
endless
trail
why
it
was
only
the
coming
to
the
end
that
a
man
minded
suddenly
the
beauty
that
for
days
had
been
veiled
shone
out
nothing
in
all
the
earth
was
glorious
with
the
glory
of
the
terrible
white
north
and
he
had
only
just
been
wakened
to
it
here
now
lying
in
his
grave
had
come
this
special
revelation
of
the
rapture
of
living
and
the
splendour
of
the
visible
universe
the
sky
over
his
head
he
had
called
it
a
mean
outlook
and
turned
away
it
was
the
same
sky
that
bent
over
him
now
with
a
tenderness
that
made
him
lift
his
cramped
arms
with
tears
as
a
sick
child
might
to
its
mother
the
haloed
sun
with
his
attendant
dogs
how
little
the
wonder
had
touched
him
never
had
he
seen
them
so
dim
and
sad
as
saying
to
one
who
loved
the
sun
the
great
frozen
road
out
of
sight
below
road
that
came
winding
winding
down
out
of
the
arctic
circle
what
other
highway
so
majestic
mysterious
shining
and
beckoning
on
an
earthly
milky
way
leading
to
the
golden
paradise
he
had
been
travelling
towards
since
summer
and
he
was
to
go
no
further
not
till
the
june
rains
and
thaws
and
winds
and
floods
should
carry
him
back
as
he
had
foreseen
far
below
there
at
holy
cross
with
a
sharp
contraction
of
the
heart
he
shut
his
eyes
again
when
he
opened
them
they
rested
on
the
a
couple
of
yards
above
holding
out
mocking
and
he
turned
his
head
in
the
snow
till
again
he
could
see
the
looking
down
as
well
try
to
reach
the
sky
as
reach
the
what
did
that
mean
that
he
was
really
going
to
lie
there
till
he
died
die
and
the
colonel
and
everybody
else
go
on
living
he
half
rose
on
his
elbow
at
the
monstrous
absurdity
of
the
idea
i
wo
die
he
said
out
loud
crack
crack
warned
the
between
him
and
that
long
fall
to
the
river
with
horror
at
his
heart
he
shrank
away
and
hugged
the
face
of
the
precipice
presently
he
put
out
his
hand
and
broke
the
above
with
mittened
fists
and
palms
he
pounded
firm
a
little
ledge
of
snow
reaching
out
further
he
broke
the
crust
obliquely
just
above
and
having
packed
the
snow
as
well
as
he
could
immediately
about
and
moving
lengthwise
with
an
infinite
caution
he
crawled
up
the
few
inches
to
the
narrow
ledge
balancing
his
stiff
body
with
a
nicety
possible
only
to
acrobat
or
it
was
in
no
normal
state
of
ordinary
waking
senses
that
the
work
went
on
with
never
a
downward
look
nor
even
up
eyes
riveted
to
the
patch
of
snow
on
which
the
mittened
hands
fell
as
steady
and
untrembling
as
steel
hammers
in
the
seconds
of
actual
consciousness
of
his
situation
that
twice
visited
him
he
crouched
on
the
ledge
with
closed
eyes
in
the
clutch
of
an
overmastering
horror
absolutely
still
like
a
bird
in
the
talons
of
a
hawk
each
time
when
he
opened
his
eyes
he
would
stare
at
the
till
hypnotised
into
disregard
of
danger
balance
his
slight
body
lift
one
hand
and
go
on
pounding
firm
another
shallow
step
when
he
reached
the
his
heart
gave
a
great
leap
of
triumph
then
for
the
first
time
since
starting
he
looked
up
his
heart
fell
down
it
seemed
farther
than
ever
and
the
light
waning
but
the
twilight
would
be
long
he
told
himself
and
in
that
other
beneficent
inner
twilight
he
worked
on
packing
the
snow
and
crawling
gingerly
up
the
perilous
stair
a
at
a
time
at
last
he
was
on
the
jutting
rock
and
could
stand
secure
but
here
he
could
see
that
the
top
of
the
bluff
really
did
shelve
over
to
think
so
is
so
common
an
illusion
to
the
climber
that
the
boy
had
heartened
himself
by
saying
when
he
got
there
he
would
find
it
like
the
rest
horribly
steep
but
not
impossible
well
it
impossible
after
all
his
labour
he
was
no
better
off
on
the
rock
than
in
the
below
the
alder
down
there
where
he
dared
not
look
the
sun
and
his
dogs
had
travelled
down
down
they
touched
the
horizon
while
he
sat
there
they
slipped
below
the
world
wide
rim
he
said
in
his
heart
i
freezing
to
death
unexpectedly
to
himself
his
despair
found
voice
colonel
hello
he
started
violently
had
he
really
heard
that
or
was
imagination
playing
tricks
with
echo
colonel
where
the
devil
a
man
head
appeared
out
of
the
sky
got
the
rope
words
indistinguishable
floated
down
the
head
withdrawn
silence
the
boy
waited
a
very
long
time
but
he
stamped
his
feet
and
kept
his
blood
in
motion
the
light
was
very
grey
when
the
head
showed
again
at
the
he
could
hear
what
was
shouted
down
and
it
occurred
to
him
even
in
his
huge
predicament
that
the
colonel
was
giving
him
hot
air
as
usual
instead
of
a
down
the
rope
came
nearer
and
stopped
about
fifteen
feet
over
his
head
got
the
axe
let
her
down
the
night
was
bright
with
moonlight
when
the
boy
stood
again
on
the
top
of
the
bluff
humph
says
the
colonel
with
agreeable
anticipation
you
be
glad
to
camp
for
a
few
days
after
this
i
reckon
reckon
i
wo
in
their
colossal
fatigue
they
slept
the
clock
round
their
watches
run
down
their
sense
of
the
very
date
blurred
since
the
colonel
had
made
the
last
laconic
entry
in
the
journal
was
it
three
days
or
two
or
twenty
in
spite
of
a
sensation
as
of
many
broken
bones
the
boy
put
on
the
colonel
and
went
off
looking
along
the
foot
of
the
cliff
for
his
own
no
luck
but
he
brought
back
some
and
a
handful
of
and
set
about
making
a
rude
substitute
before
they
had
despatched
breakfast
the
great
red
moon
arose
so
it
was
not
morning
but
evening
so
much
the
better
the
crust
would
be
firmer
the
moon
was
full
it
was
bright
enough
to
travel
and
travel
they
must
no
said
the
colonel
with
a
touch
of
his
old
pompous
authority
we
wait
awhile
the
boy
simply
pointed
to
the
there
was
a
good
handful
left
they
ate
supper
studiously
avoiding
each
other
eyes
in
the
background
of
the
boy
mind
he
saved
my
life
but
he
ran
no
risk
and
i
saved
his
we
quits
in
the
colonel
vague
insistent
stirred
the
thought
i
might
have
left
him
there
to
rot
up
the
precipice
oh
he
go
he
take
the
no
his
vanished
strength
flowed
back
upon
a
tide
of
rage
only
one
one
kettle
one
axe
one
pair
of
no
by
the
living
lord
not
while
i
have
a
gun
where
my
gun
he
looked
about
guiltily
under
his
lowered
lids
what
no
yes
it
was
gone
who
packed
at
the
last
camp
why
he
himself
and
he
left
it
behind
then
it
was
because
i
did
see
it
the
boy
took
care
i
should
see
it
very
likely
he
buried
it
so
that
i
should
see
it
he
yes
if
i
refuse
to
go
on
he
and
the
boy
seeing
without
looking
taking
in
every
move
every
shade
in
the
mood
of
the
man
ready
to
die
here
like
a
dog
in
the
snow
instead
of
pressing
on
as
long
as
he
could
crawl
the
boy
in
a
fever
of
silent
rage
called
him
that
meanest
word
in
the
language
a
quitter
and
as
surreptitiously
he
took
in
the
vast
discouragement
of
the
older
man
there
was
nothing
in
the
boy
changed
heart
to
say
poor
fellow
if
he
ca
go
on
i
stay
and
die
with
him
but
only
he
to
go
on
and
if
he
refuses
well
he
felt
about
in
his
deadened
brain
and
the
best
he
could
bring
forth
was
i
wo
leave
him
a
mighty
had
forced
them
up
on
the
low
range
of
hills
it
was
about
midnight
to
judge
by
the
moon
clear
of
snow
and
the
wind
down
the
boy
straightened
up
at
a
curious
sight
just
below
them
something
black
in
the
moonlight
the
colonel
paused
looked
down
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
the
boy
had
seen
the
thing
first
and
had
said
to
himself
looks
like
a
sled
but
it
a
vision
it
come
to
seeing
things
now
when
he
saw
the
colonel
stop
and
stare
he
threw
down
his
rope
and
began
to
laugh
for
there
below
were
the
blackened
remains
of
a
big
fire
silhouetted
sharply
on
the
snow
looks
like
we
come
to
a
camp
boss
he
had
called
the
colonel
by
the
old
nickname
for
many
a
day
he
stood
there
laughing
in
an
idiotic
kind
of
way
wrapping
his
stiff
hands
in
his
parki
indian
fashion
and
looking
down
to
the
level
of
the
ancient
river
terrace
where
the
old
indian
sled
was
sharply
etched
on
the
moonlit
whiteness
just
a
sled
lying
in
the
moonlight
but
the
change
that
can
be
wrought
in
a
man
heart
upon
sight
of
a
human
sign
it
may
be
idle
to
speak
of
that
to
any
but
those
who
have
travelled
the
desolate
ways
of
the
north
side
by
side
the
two
went
down
the
slope
slid
and
slipped
and
stop
themselves
till
they
were
below
the
landmark
looking
up
they
saw
that
a
piece
of
soiled
canvas
or
a
skin
held
down
with
a
fell
from
under
the
sled
from
the
top
of
the
terrace
straight
down
to
the
sheltered
level
where
the
camp
fire
had
been
coming
closer
they
saw
the
curtain
was
not
canvas
but
dressed
deerskin
indians
said
the
colonel
but
with
the
rubbing
out
of
other
distinctions
this
too
was
curiously
faint
just
so
there
were
human
beings
it
seemed
enough
within
four
feet
of
the
deerskin
door
the
colonel
stopped
shot
through
by
a
sharp
misgiving
what
was
behind
a
living
man
camp
or
a
dead
man
tomb
succour
or
some
stark
picture
of
defeat
and
of
their
own
oncoming
doom
the
colonel
stood
waiting
for
the
boy
for
the
first
time
in
many
days
even
he
hung
back
he
seemed
to
lack
the
courage
to
be
the
one
to
extinguish
hope
by
the
mere
drawing
of
a
curtain
from
a
face
the
kentuckian
pulled
himself
together
and
went
forward
he
lifted
his
hand
to
the
deerskin
but
his
fingers
shook
so
he
could
take
hold
hello
he
called
no
sound
again
hello
who
there
the
two
outside
turned
and
looked
into
each
other
faces
but
if
you
want
to
know
all
the
moment
meant
you
must
travel
the
winter
trail
chapter

swear
to
you

by

i
swear
for
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
socrates
the
voice
that
had
asked
the
question
belonged
to
one
of
two
stranded
klondykers
as
it
turned
out
who
had
burrowed
a
hole
in
the
snow
and
faced
it
with
they
had
plenty
of
provisions
enough
to
spare
and
meant
to
stay
here
till
the
steamers
ran
for
the
younger
of
the
pair
had
frosted
his
feet
and
was
crippled
the
last
of
their
dogs
had
been
frozen
to
death
a
few
miles
back
on
the
trail
and
they
had
no
idea
apparently
how
near
they
were
to
that
first
indian
settlement
this
side
of
kaltag
reached
by
the
colonel
and
the
boy
after
two
days
of
rest
and
one
day
of
travel
no
one
ever
sailed
more
joyfully
into
the
bay
of
naples
or
saw
with
keener
rapture
constantinople
mosques
and
minarets
arise
than
did
these
travellers
rounding
the
sharp
bend
in
the
river
sight
the
huts
and
hear
the
dogs
howl
on
the
farther
shore
first
thing
i
do

is
to
speculate
in
a
said
the
colonel
most
of
the
bucks
were
gone
off
hunting
and
most
of
the
dogs
were
with
them
only
three
left
in
the
village
but
they
were
wonderful
fellows
those
three
where
were
they
well
the
old
man
you
see
before
you
got
two
he
led
the
way
behind
a
little
shack
a
troop
of
children
following
and
there
were
two
not
in
the
best
condition
one
reddish
with
a
white
face
and
white
forelegs
the
other
grey
with
a
black

chest
and

one
on

back

the

he
held

approaching

the
old

to
chatter

a
dusky
siwash
thin
but
and
none
too
the
children
all
brightened
and
craned
as
if
a
friend
or
at
least
a
highly
interesting
member
of
the
community
had
appeared
on
the
scene

nigger

the
boy

said
the
lad
and
seemed
about
to
pat
him
but
the
siwash
snarled
softly
raising
his
lip
and
showing
his
gleaming
fangs
the
lad
stepped
back
respectfully
but
grinned
reiterating
bully
dog
well
i
give
you
fifty
for
him
said
the
colonel
sixty
well
all
right
since
he
a
leader
sixty
the
owner
watched
the
dog
as
it
walked
round
its
master
smelling
the
snow
then
turning
up
its
pointed
nose
interrogatively
and
waving
its
magnificent
feathery
tail
the
oblique
eyes
acute
angle
of
his
short
ears
the
thick
neck
broad
chest
and
heavy
forelegs
gave
an
impression
of
mingled
alertness
and
strength
you
will
not
see
surpassed
in
any
animal
that
walks
the
world
except
for
his
grey
muzzle
and
broad
chest
he
looks
at
you
with
the
face
of
his
near
ancestor
the
grizzled
wolf
if
on
short
acquaintance
you
offer
any
familiarity
as
the
colonel
ventured
to
do
and
he
shows
his
double
row
of
fangs
the
reminder
of
his
fierce
forefathers
is
even
more
insistent
indeed
to
this
day
your
siwash
of
this
sort
will
have
his
moments
of
nostalgia
in
which
he
turns
back
to
his
wild
kinsfolk
and
mates
again
with
the
wolf
when
the
leader
looked
at
the
colonel
with
that
indescribably
horrid
smile
the
owner
approval
of
the
proud
beast
seemed
to
overcome
his
avarice
me
no
sell
he
decided
abruptly
and
walked
off
in
lordly
fashion
with
his
dusky
companion
at
his
side
the
leader
curling
his
feathery
tail
over
his
back
and
walking
with
an
air
princes
might
envy
the
colonel
stood
staring
vainly
the
boy
called
come
back
look
here
hi
neither
siwash
nor
ingalik
took
the
smallest
notice
the
boy
went
after
them
eliciting
only
airs
of
surly
indifference
and
repeated
me
no
sell
it
was
a
bitter
disappointment
especially
to
the
boy
he
liked
the
looks
of
that
nigger
dog
when
plunged
in
gloom
he
returned
to
the
group
about
the
colonel
he
found
his
pardner
asking
about
feed
no
the
old
man
had
enough
fish
to
spare
even
a
few
supply
would
anybody
here
sell
fish
no
he
did
think
so
all
the
men
who
had
teams
were
gone
to
the
hills
for
caribou
there
was
nobody
to
send
to
the
summer
caches
he
held
out
his
hand
again
for
the
first
instalment
of
the
eightee
dolla
in
kind
that
he
might
put
it
in
his
pipe
but
dogs
are
no
good
to
us
without
something
to
feed
the
ingalik
looked
round
as
one
seeking
counsel
get
fish
tomalla
no
sir
the
only
day
in
my
calendar
no
buy
dogs
till
we
get
fish
when
the
negotiations
fell
through
the
indian
took
the
failure
far
more
philosophically
than
the
white
men
as
was
natural
the
old
fellow
could
quite
well
get
on
without
eightee
dolla
could
even
get
on
without
the
tobacco
tea
sugar
and
matches
represented
by
that
sum
but
the
travellers
could
not
without
dogs
get
to
min√≥ok
it
had
been
very
well
to
feel
set
up
because
they
had
done
the
thing
that
everybody
said
was
impossible
it
had
been
a
costly
victory
yes
it
had
come
high
and
after
all
if
we
do
get
dogs
we
beaten
oh
beaten
be
blowed
we
toddle
along
somehow
yes
we
toddle
along
we
get
dogs
and
the
boy
knew
the
colonel
was
right
they
inquired
about
kaltag
i
reckon
we
better
push
ahead
while
we
can
said
the
colonel
so
they
left
the
camp
that
same
evening
intending
to
travel
with
the
moon
the
settlement
was
barely
out
of
sight
when
they
met
a
squaw
dragging
a
of
salmon
here
was
luck
and
now
we
go
back
and
get
those
two
dogs
as
it
was
late
and
trading
with
the
natives
even
for
a
fish
was
a
matter
of
much
time
and
patience
they
decided
not
to
hurry
the
dog
deal
it
was
bound
to
take
a
good
part
of
the
evening
at
any
rate
well
another
night
resting
up
was
welcome
enough
while
the
colonel
was
himself
in
the
best
cabin
the
boy
cached
the
sled
and
then
went
prowling
about
as
he
fully
intended
he
fell
in
with
the
leader
that
bully
nigger
dog
his
master
not
in
sight
nobody
but
some
dirty
children
and
the
stranger
there
to
see
how
the
red
dog
in
a
moment
of
aberration
dared
offer
insolence
to
the
leader
it
all
happened
through
the
boy
producing
a
fish
and
presenting
it
on
bended
knee
at
a
respectful
distance
the
leader
bestowed
a
contemptuous
stare
upon
the
stranger
and
pointedly
turned
his
back
the
red
dog
came
loping
across
the
snow
as
he
made
for
the
fish
the
leader
quietly
headed
him
off
pointed
his
sharp
ears
and
just
looked
the
other
fellow
out
of
countenance
red
said
things
under
his
breath
as
he
turned
away
the
more
he
thought
the
situation
over
the
more
he
felt
himself
outraged
he
looked
round
over
his
shoulder
there
they
still
were
the
stranger
holding
out
the
fish
the
leader
turning
his
back
on
it
but
telegraphing
red
at
the
same
time
to
dare
it
was
more
than
could
bear
red
bounded
back
exploding
in
snarls
no
sound
out
of
the
leader
whether
this
unnatural
calm
misled
red
he
came
up
closer
braced
his
forelegs
and
thrust
his
tawny
muzzle
almost
into
the
other
dog
face
drew
back
his
lips
from
all
those
shining
wicked
teeth
and
uttered
a
muffled
hiss
well
it
was
magnificently
done
and
it
certainly
looked
as
if
the
leader
was
going
to
have
a
troubled
evening
but
he
did
seem
to
think
so
he
fixed
the
red
dog
as
one
knowing
the
power
of
the
master
eye
to
quell
red
reply
unimaginably
bold
was
as
the
boy
described
it
to
the
colonel
to
give
the
other
fella
the
curse
the
boy
was
proud
of
red
pluck
already
looking
upon
him
as
his
own
but
he
jumped
up
from
his
ingratiating
attitude
still
grasping
the
dried
fish
it
would
be
a
shame
if
that
leader
got
chewed
up
and
there
was
red
every
tooth
bared
gasping
for
gore
and
with
each
passing
second
seeming
to
throw
a
deeper
damnation
into
his
threat
and
to
brace
himself
more
firmly
for
the
hurling
of
the
final
doom
at
that
instant
the
stranger
breathing
quick
and
hard
the
elder
children
leaning
forward
some
of
the
younger
drawing
back
in
terror
if
you
believe
it
the
leader
blinked
in
a
bored
way
and
sat
down
on
the
snow
a
question
only
of
last
moments
now
poor
brute
and
the
bystanders
held
their
breath
but
no
red
to
be
sure
broke
into
the
most
awful
demonstrations
and
nearly
burst
himself
with
fury
but
he
backed
away
as
though
the
spectacle
offered
by
the
leader
were
too
disgusting
for
a
decent
dog
to
look
at
he
went
behind
the
shack
and
told
the
spotty
one
in
no
time
they
were
back
approaching
the
boy
and
the
fish
discreetly
from
behind
such
mean
tactics
roused
the
leader
ire
he
got
up
and
flew
at
them
they
made
it
hot
for
him
but
still
the
leader
seemed
to
be
doing
pretty
well
for
himself
when
the
old
ingalik
whom
the
boy
had
sent
a
child
to
summon
hobbled
up
with
a
whip
and
laid
it
on
with
a
practised
hand
separating
the
combatants
kicking
them
impartially
all
round
and
speaking
injurious
words
are
your
two
hurt
inquired
the
future
owner
anxiously
the
old
fellow
shook
his
head
fur
thick
was
the
reassuring
answer
and
once
more
the
boy
realised
that
these
canine
encounters
though
frequently
ending
in
death
often
look
and
sound
much
more
awful
than
they
are
as
the
leader
feigned
to
be
going
home
he
made
a
dash
in
passing
at
the
stranger
fish
it
was
held
tight
and
the
pirate
got
off
with
only
a
fragment
leader
gave
one
swallow
and
looked
back
to
see
how
the
theft
was
being
taken
that
surprising
stranger
simply
stood
there
laughing
and
holding
out
the
rest
of
a
fine
fat
fish
leader
considered
a
moment
looked
the
alien
up
and
down
came
back
all
on
guard
for
sudden
rushes
sly
kicks
and
thwackings
to
pay
him
out
but
nothing
of
the
kind
the
nigger
dog
said
as
plain
as
speech
could
make
it
you
cheechalko
person
you
look
as
if
you
actually
offering
me
that
fish
in
good
faith
but
i
be
a
fool
to
think
so
the
stranger
spoke
low
and
quietly
they
talked
for
some
time
the
owner
of
the
two
had
shuffled
off
home
again
with
spotty
and
red
at
his
heels
the
leader
came
quite
near
looking
almost
docile
but
he
snapped
suddenly
at
the
fish
with
an
ugly
gleam
of
eye
and
fang
the
boy
nearly
made
the
fatal
mistake
of
jumping
but
he
controlled
the
impulse
and
merely
held
tight
to
what
was
left
of
the
salmon
he
stood
quite
still
offering
it
with
fair
words
the
leader
walked
all
round
him
and
seemed
with
difficulty
to
recover
from
his
surprise
the
boy
felt
that
they
were
just
coming
to
an
understanding
when
up
hurries
peetka
suspicious
and
out
of
sorts
my
dog
he
shouted
no
sell
white
man
my
dog
huh
ho
no
he
kicked
the
leader
viciously
and
drove
him
home
abusing
him
all
the
way
the
wonder
was
that
the
wolfish
creature
did
fly
at
his
master
throat
and
finish
him
certainly
the
stranger
sympathies
were
all
with
the
one
of
the
two
something
about
the
leader
the
boy
said
sadly
telling
the
colonel
what
had
happened
well
sir
i
give
a
hundred
dollars
to
own
that
dog
so
would
i
was
the
dry
rejoinder
if
i
were
a
millionaire
like
you
after
supper
their
host
who
had
been
sent
out
to
bring
in
the
owner
of
red
and
spotty
came
back
saying
he
come
all
come
me
tell
you
from
below
holy
cross
he
laughed
and
shook
his
head
in
a
incredulity
representing
popular
opinion
outside
some
of
the
bucks
he
added
who
had
not
gone
far
had
got
back
with
small
game
and
dogs
no
dogs
in
the
mountains
hunt
moose
caribou
the
old
ingalik
came
in
followed
by
others
some
of
the
bucks
there
seemed
no
end
to
the
throng
opposite
the
white
men
the
indians
sat
in
a
semicircle
with
the
sole
intent
you
might
think
of
staring
all
night
at
the
strangers
yet
they
had
brought
in
arctic
hares
and
grouse
and
even
a
haunch
of
venison
but
they
laid
these
things
on
the
floor
beside
them
and
sat
with
grave
unbroken
silence
till
the
strangers
should
declare
themselves
they
had
also
brought
or
permitted
to
follow
not
only
their
wives
and
daughters
but
their
children
big
and
little
behind
the
semicircle
of
men
three
or
four
deep
were
ranged
the
ranks
of
youth
boys
and
girls
from
six
to
fourteen
standing
as
silent
as
their
elders
but
eager
watchful
carrying
king
salmon
dried
thongs
for
rabbits
grouse
a
little
fellow
of
ten
or
eleven
had
brought
in
the
red
dog
and
was
trying
to
reconcile
him
to
his
close
quarters
the
owner
of
red
and
spotty
sat
with
empty
hands
at
the
semicircle
farthest
end
but
he
was
the
capitalist
of
the
village
and
held
himself
worthily
yet
not
quite
with
the
high
and
mighty
unconcern
of
the
owner
of
the
leader
peetka
came
in
late
bringing
in
the
nigger
dog
against
the
nigger
dog
will
just
to
tantalise
the
white
men
with
the
sight
of
something
they
could
buy
from
the
poor
indian
everybody
made
way
for
peetka
and
his
dog
except
the
other
dog
several
people
had
to
go
to
the
assistance
of
the
little
boy
to
help
him
to
hold
red
just
as
well
perhaps
said
the
colonel
that
we
are
likely
to
get
all
three
oh
if
they
worked
together
they
be
all
right
answered
the
boy
i
noticed
that
before
but
the
leader
meanwhile
was
flatly
refusing
to
stay
in
the
same
room
with
red
he
howled
and
snapped
and
raged
so
poor
red
was
turned
out
and
the
little
boy
mourned
loudly
behind
the
children
a
row
of
squaws
against
the
wall
with
and
without
babies
strapped
at
their
backs
occasionally
a
young
girl
would
push
aside
those
in
front
of
her
craning
and
staring
to
take
in
the
astonishing
spectacle
of
the
two
white
men
who
had
come
so
far
without
dogs
pulling
a
a
greater
distance
than
any
indian
had
ever
done
if
they
could
be
believed
anyhow
these
men
with
their
sack
of
tea
and
magnificent
bundle
of
matches
above
all
with
their
tobacco
they
could
buy
out
the
town
everything
except
peetka
dog
the
colonel
and
the
boy
opened
the
ball
by
renewing
their
joint
offer
of
eighty
dollars
for
red
and
spotty
although
this
had
been
the
old
ingalik
own
price
it
was
discussed
fully
an
hour
by
all
present
before
the
matter
could
be
considered
finally
settled
even
then
the
colonel
knew
it
was
safest
not
to
pay
till
just
upon
leaving
but
he
made
a
little
present
of
tobacco
in
token
of
satisfactory
arrangement
the
old
man
hands
trembled
excitedly
as
he
pulled
out
his
pipe
and
filled
it
the
bucks
round
him
and
even
a
couple
of
the
women
at
the
back
begged
him
for
some
he
seemed
to
say
do
your
own
deal
the
strangers
have
plenty
more
in
spite
of
the
limited
english
of
the
community
certain
facts
stood
out
that
peetka
held
the
white
man
in
avowed
detestation
that
he
was
the
leading
spirit
of
the
place
that
they
had
all
been
suffering
from
a
tobacco
famine
and
that
much
might
be
done
by
a
judicious
use
of
black
jack
and
long
green
the
colonel
set
forth
the
magnificent
generosity
of
which
he
would
be
capable
could
he
secure
a
good
leader
but
peetka
although
he
looked
at
his
empty
pipe
with
bitterness
shook
his
head
everybody
in
the
village
would
profit
the
colonel
went
on
everybody
should
have
a
present
if
peetka
interrupted
with
a
snarl
and
flung
out
low
words
of
contemptuous
refusal
the
leader
waked
from
a
brief
nap
cramped
and
uneasy
and
began
to
howl
in
sympathy
his
master
stood
up
the
better
to
deliver
a
brutal
kick
this
seemed
to
help
the
leader
to
put
up
with
cramp
and
confinement
just
as
one
great
discomfort
will
help
his
betters
to
forget
several
little
ones
but
the
boy
had
risen
with
angry
eyes
very
well
he
said
impulsively
if
he
and
his
pardner
could
get
a
third
dog
two
were
very
little
good
they
would
not
stock
fresh
meat
here
in
vain
the
colonel
whispered
admonition
no
sir
they
would
wait
till
they
got
to
the
next
village
belly
far
said
a
young
hunter
placing
ostentatiously
in
front
his
brace
of
grouse
we
used
to
going
belly
far
take
all
your
game
away
and
go
home
a
sorrowful
silence
fell
upon
the
room
they
sat
for
some
time
like
that
no
one
so
much
as
moving
till
a
voice
said
we
want
tobacco
and
a
general
murmur
of
assent
arose
peetka
roused
himself
pulled
out
of
his
shirt
a
concave
stone
and
a
little
knot
the
boy
leaned
forward
to
see
what
it
was
a
piece
of
dried
fungus
the
kind
you
sometimes
see
on
the
birches
up
here
peetka
was
hammering
a
fragment
of
it
into
powder
with
his
heavy
on
the
concave
stone
he
swept
the
particles
into
his
pipe
and
applied
to
one
of
the
women
for
a
match
lit
up
and
lounged
back
against
the
leader
smiling
disagreeably
at
the
strangers
a
little
laugh
at
their
expense
went
round
the
room
oh
it
was
easy
to
get
ahead
of
peetka
but
even
if
he
chose
to
pretend
that
he
did
want
cheechalko
tobacco
it
was
very
serious
it
was
desperate
to
see
all
that
black
jack
going
on
to
the
next
village
several
of
the
hitherto
silent
bucks
remonstrated
with
peetka
even
one
of
the
women
dared
raise
her
voice
she
had
not
been
able
to
go
for
fish
where
was
tobacco
and
tea
peetka
burst
into
voluble
defence
of
his
position
casting
occasional
looks
of
disdain
upon
the
strangers
he
addressed
most
of
his
remarks
to
the
owner
of
red
and
spotty
although
the
colonel
could
not
understand
a
word
he
saw
the
moment
approaching
when
that
person
would
go
back
on
his
bargain
with
uncommon
pleasure
he
could
have
throttled
peetka
the
boy
to
create
a
diversion
had
begun
talking
to
a
young
hunter
in
the
front
row
about
the
long
trail
and
seeing
that
several
others
craned
and
listened
he
spoke
louder
more
slowly
dropping
out
all
unnecessary
or
unusual
words
very
soon
he
had
gained
an
audience
and
peetka
had
lost
one
as
the
stranger
went
on
describing
their
experiences
the
whole
room
listened
with
an
attentiveness
that
would
have
been
flattering
had
it
been
less
strongly
dashed
with
unbelief
from
beyond
anvik
they
had
come
like
that
with
no
dogs
what
from
below
koserefsky
not
really
peetka
grunted
and
shook
his
head
did
they
think
the
ingaliks
were
children
without
dogs
that
journey
was
impossible
low
whispers
and
gruff
exclamations
filled
the
room
white
men
were
great
liars
they
pretended
that
in
their
country
the
bacon
had
legs
and
could
run
about
and
one
had
been
heard
to
say
he
had
travelled
in
a
thing
like
a
steamboat
only
it
could
go
without
water
under
it
ran
over
the
dry
land
on
strips
of
iron
ran
quicker
than
any
steamer
oh
they
were
awful
liars
but
these
two
who
pretended
dragged
a
sled
all
the
way
from
holy
cross
they
were
the
biggest
liars
of
all
just
let
them
tell
that
yarn
to
unookuk
they
all
laughed
at
this
and
the
name
ran
round
the
room
who
is
unookuk
him
guide
him
know
where
is
him
asked
the
boy
him
sick
but
there
was
whispering
and
consultation
this
was
evidently
a
case
for
the
expert
two
boys
ran
out
and
the
native
talk
went
on
unintelligible
save
for
the
fact
that
it
centred
round
unookuk
in
a
few
minutes
the
boys
came
back
with
a
tall
native
about
sixty
years
old
walking
lame
and
leaning
on
a
stick
the
semicircle
opened
to
admit
him
he
limped
over
to
the
strangers
and
stood
looking
at
them
gravely
modestly
but
with
careful
scrutiny
the
boy
held
out
his
hand
how
do
you
do
how
do
you
do
echoed
the
and
he
also
shook
hands
with
the
colonel
before
he
sat
down
are
you
unookuk
yes
how
far
you
come
peetka
said
something
rude
before
the
strangers
had
time
to
answer
and
all
the
room
went
into
titters
but
unookuk
listened
with
dignity
while
the
colonel
repeated
briefly
the
story
already
told
plainly
it
stumped
unookuk
come
from
anvik
he
repeated
yes
stayed
with
mr
benham
oh
benham
the
trader
familiar
name
ran
round
the
room
with
obvious
effect
it
is
good
to
have
agent
for
friend
said
unookuk
guardedly
everybody
know
benham
he
is
not
agent
much
longer
volunteered
the
boy
that
so
no
he
will
go
his
own
after
the
new
agent
gets
in
this
spring
it
is
true
answered
unookuk
gravely
for
the
first
time
a
little
impressed
for
this
news
was
not
yet
common
property
still
they
could
have
heard
it
from
some
passer
with
a
the
boy
spoke
of
holy
cross
and
unookuk
grave
unbelief
was
painted
on
every
feature
it
was
good
you
get
to
holy
cross
before
the
big
storm
he
said
with
a
faint
smile
of
tolerance
for
the
white
man
tall
story
but
peetka
laughed
aloud
what
good
english
you
speak
said
the
boy
determined
to
make
friends
with
the
most
native
he
had
seen
me
i
am
kurilla
said
unookuk
with
a
quiet
magnificence
then
seeing
no
electric
recognition
of
the
name
he
added
you
savvy
kurilla
the
colonel
with
much
regret
admitted
that
he
did
not
but
i
am
dall
guide
kurilla
oh
dall
guide

said
the
boy
without
a
glimmer
of
who
dall
was
or
for
what
or
to
what
he
was
guided
well
kurilla
we
pleased
and
proud

said
the
colonel

fortunately
the
boy
was
saved
from
need
to
answer

said
kurilla
with
pride
me
dall

oh

somehow
said
the
colonel
kurilla
bore
him
out

thirty
year
he
first
come
up
here
with
survey
people
make
big
overland
of
course
i
heard
about
that
the
colonel
turned
to
the
boy
it
was
just
before
the
russians
sold
out
and
when
a
lot
of
exploring
and
surveying
and
was
done
here
and
in
siberia
the
atlantic
cable
was
laid
and
knocked
the
overland
scheme
kurilla
gravely
verified
these
facts
and
me
dall
chief
guide
me
with
dall
when
he
make
portage
from
unalaklik
to
kaltag
he
see
the
yukon
first
time
he
run
down
to
be
first
on
the
ice
dall
and
the
coast
natives
stare
like
so
kurilla
made
a
ludicrous
face
and
they
say
is
not
a
river
it
is
another
sea
no
wonder
i
hear
it
ten
miles
wide
up
by
the
flats
and
even
a
little
below
where
we
wintered
at
ikogimeut
it
four
miles
across
from
bank
to
bank
kurilla
looked
at
the
colonel
with
dignified
reproach
why
did
he
go
on
lying
about
his
journey
like
that
to
an
expert
even
at
holy
cross
the
boy
began
but
kurilla
struck
in
when
you
there
oh
about
three
weeks
ago
peetka
made
remarks
in
ingalik
father
macmanus
him
all
right
asked
kurilla
politely
cloaking
his
macmanus
do
you
mean
wills
or
the
superior
father
brachet
oh
yes
macmanus
at
tanana
he
spoke
as
though
inadvertently
he
had
confused
the
names
as
the
strangers
gave
him
the
winter
news
from
holy
cross
his
wonder
and
astonishment
grew
presently
do
you
know
my
friend
nicholas
of
pymeut
asked
the
boy
kurilla
took
his
empty
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
smiled
in
broad
surprise
nicholas
repeated
several
others
it
was
plain
the
pymeut
pilot
enjoyed
a
wide
repute
the
boy
spoke
of
the
famine
and
ol
chief
illness
it
is
true
said
unookuk
gravely
and
turning
he
added
something
in
ingalik
to
the
company
peetka
answered
back
as
surly
as
ever
but
the
boy
went
on
telling
how
the
shaman
had
cured
ol
chief
and
that
turned
out
to
be
a
surprisingly
popular
story
peetka
interrupt
it
even
to
curse
the
leader
for
getting
up
and
stretching
himself
when
the
dog
feeling
that
for
some
reason
discipline
was
relaxed
dared
to
leave
his
cramped
quarters
and
come
out
into
the
little
open
space
between
the
white
men
and
the
assembly
the
boy
forced
himself
to
go
straight
on
with
his
story
as
if
he
had
not
observed
the
liberty
the
leader
was
taking
when
after
standing
there
an
instant
the
dog
came
over
and
threw
himself
down
at
the
stranger
feet
as
if
publicly
adopting
him
the
white
dared
not
meet
peetka
eye
he
was
privately
most
uneasy
at
the
nigger
dog
tactless
move
and
he
hurried
on
about
how
brother
paul
caught
the
sham√°n
and
about
the
penitential
journey
told
how
long
before
that
early
in
the
fall
nicholas
had
got
lost
making
the
portage
from
michael
and
how
the
white
camp
had
saved
him
from
starvation
how
in
turn
the
pymeuts
had
pulled
the
speaker
out
of
a
what
tremendous
friends
the
pymeuts
were
with
these
particular
very
good
sort
of
white
men
here
he
seemed
to
allow
by
implication
for
prejudice
there
were
two
kinds
of
strangers
and
on
an
impulse
he
drew
out
muckluck
medal
he
would
have
them
to
know
so
highly
were
these
present
specimens
of
the
doubtful
race
regarded
by
the
pymeuts
such
friends
were
they
that
nicholas
sister
had
given
him
this
for
an
offering
to
yukon
inua
that
the
great
spirit
might
help
them
on
their
way
he
owned
himself
wrong
to
have
delayed
this
sacrifice
he
must
throw
it
into
the
first
he
came
to
unless
indeed
his
eye
caught
kurilla
with
the
help
of
his
stick
the
old
guide
pulled
his
big
body
up
on
his
one
stout
leg
hobbled
nearer
and
gravely
eyed
muckluck
offering
as
it
swung
to
and
fro
on
its
over
the
leader
head
the
boy
quite
conscious
of
some
subtle
change
in
the
hitherto
immobile
face
of
the
indian
laid
the
token
in
his
hand
standing
there
in
the
centre
of
the
semicircle
between
the
assembly
and
the
dog
kurilla
turned
the
great
katharine
medal
over
examining
it
closely
every
eye
in
the
room
upon
him
when
he
lifted
his
head
there
was
a
rustle
of
expectation
and
a
craning
forward
it
is
the
same
kurilla
spoke
slowly
like
one
half
in
a
dream
when
i
go
down
river
thirty
winter
back
with
the
great
dall
he
try
buy
this
off
nicholas
mother
she
wear
it
on
string
red
russian
beads
oh
it
is
a
thing
to
remember
he
nodded
his
grey
head
significantly
but
he
went
on
with
the
bare
evidence
when
make
last
trip
down
this
fall
nicholas
pilot
you
savvy
they
let
him
take
his
sister
holy
cross
to
pymeut
i
see
she
wear
this
round
neck
the
weight
of
the
medal
carried
the
necklace
slipping
through
his
fingers
slowly
now
with
even
impulse
the
silver
disc
swung
right
swung
left
like
the
pendulum
of
a
clock
even
the
nigger
dog
seemed
hypnotised
following
the
dim
shine
of
the
tarnished
token
i
say
nicholas
sister
is
thirty
winters
i
see
that
silver
picture
first
i
give
you
two
dolla
for
him
she
say
i
say

sit
and
think
far
back

not
for
a
hunner
but
she
it
him
for
to
make
yukon
inua
to
let
him
go
safe
hein
savvy
and
lapsing
into
ingalik
he
endorsed
this
credential
not
to
be
denied
it
is
true
he
wound
up
in
english
the
autocratrix
russorum
was
solemnly
handed
back
you
have
make
a
brave
journey
it
is
i
who
unnerstan
i
too
when
i
am
young
i
go
with
dall
on
the
long
trail
had
all
the
while
from
all
about
the
leader
owner
and
out
of
every
corner
of
the
crowded
room
had
come
a
spirited
punctuation
of
kurilla
speech
nods
and
grunts
yes
perhaps
white
men
deserved
dogs
even
peetka
kurilla
limped
back
to
his
place
but
turned
to
the
ingaliks
before
he
sat
down
and
bending
painfully
over
his
stick
not
kurilla
he
said
as
though
speaking
of
one
absent
not
make
so
great
journey
no
dogs
kurilla
best
guide
in
yukon
forty
year
kurilla
say
have
dogs
men
like
that
he
limped
back
again
and
solemnly
offered
his
hand
to
each
of
the
travellers
in
turn
shake
says
he
then
as
though
fascinated
by
the
silver
picture
he
dropped
down
by
the
boy
staring
absently
at
the
great
katharine
effigy
the
general
murmur
was
arrested
by
a
movement
from
peetka
he
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
says
he
handsomely
no
liars
sell
dog
adding
with
regretful
eye
on
the
apostate
leader
him
bully
dog
and
that
was
how
the

ended
and
how

it
does
look
hard
to
drive
a
but
just
you
try
it
in
moments
of
passion
the
first
few
days
after
their
acquisition
the
colonel
and
the
boy
wondered
why
they
had
complicated
a
sufficiently
difficult
journey
by
adding
to
other
cares
a
load
of
fish
and
three
fiends
think
how
well
they
went
for
peetka
oh
yes
part
o
their
cussedness
they
know
we
green
hands
and
they
mean
to
make
it
lively
well
they
did
they
sat
on
their
haunches
in
the
snow
and
grinned
at
the
and
futile
mush
mush
of
the
colonel
they
snapped
at
the
boy
and
made
sharp
turns
tying
him
up
in
the
traces
and
tumbling
him
into
the
snow
they
howled
all
night
long
except
during
a
blessed
interval
of
quiet
while
they
ate
their
harness
but
man
is
the
wiliest
of
the
animals
and
the
one
who
profits
by
experience
in
the
end
the
boy
became
a
capital
driver
the
dogs
came
to
know
he
meant
business
and
settled
into
submission
nig
as
he
called
the
bully
dog
for
short
turned
out
the
best
leader
in
the
yukon
they
were
much
nearer
kaltag
than
they
had
realised
arriving
after
only
two
hours
struggle
with
the
dogs
at
the
big
indian
village
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
but
their
first
appearance
here
was
clouded
by
nig
proposal
to
slay
all
the
dogs
in
sight
he
was
no
sooner
unharnessed
than
he
undertook
the
congenial
job
it
looked
for
a
few
minutes
as
if
peetka
bully
dog
would
chew
up
the
entire
canine
population
and
then
lie
down
and
die
of
his
own
wounds
but
the
kaltags
understood
the
genus
siwash
better
than
the
white
man
and
took
the
tumult
calmly
it
turned
out
that
nig
was
not
so
much
bloodthirsty
as
one
of
those
high
souls
for
ever
concerned
about
supremacy
his
first
social
act
on
catching
sight
of
his
fellow
was
to
howl
defiance
at
him
and
even
after
they
have
fought
it
out
and
come
to
some
sort
of
understanding
the
first
happy
thought
of
your
born
leader
on
awakening
is
to
proclaim
himself
boss
of
the
camp
no
sooner
has
he
published
this
conviction
of
high
calling
than
he
is
set
upon
by
the
others
punishes
them
soundly
or
is
himself
vanquished
and
driven
off
whereupon
he
sits
on
his
haunches
in
the
snow
and
with
his
pointed
nose
turned
skyward
howls
uninterruptedly
for
an
hour
or
two
when
all
is
forgiven
and
forgotten
till
the
next
time
order
being
restored
the
travellers
got
new
harness
for
the
dogs
new
boots
for
themselves
and
set
out
for
the
white
trading
post
thirty
miles
above
here
having
at
last
come
into
the
region
of
settlements
they
agreed
never
again
to
overtax
the
dogs
they
travelled
light
out
of
nulato
towards
the
koyukuk
the
dogs
simply
flew
over
those
last
miles
it
was
glorious
going
on
a
trail
like
glass
they
had
broken
the
back
of
the
journey
now
and
could
well
afford
they
thought
to
halt
an
hour
or
two
on
the
island
at
the
junction
of
the
two
great
rivers
stake
out
a
trading
post
and
treat
themselves
to
town
lots
why
town
lots
in
heaven
name
when
they
were
bound
for
min√≥ok
and
after
that
the
klondyke
hundreds
of
miles
away
well
partly
out
of
mere
gaiety
of
heart
and
partly
the
colonel
would
have
told
you
gravely
that
in
this
country
you
never
know
when
you
have
a
good
thing
they
had
left
the
one
white
layman
at
nulato
seething
with
excitement
over
an
indian
report
of
still
another
rich
strike
up
yonder
on
the
koyukuk
and
this
point
where
they
were
solemnly
staking
out
a
new
post
the
nulato
agent
had
said
was
dead
sure
to
be
a
great
centre
that
almost
unknown
region
bordering
the
great
tributary
of
the
yukon
haunt
of
the
fiercest
of
all
the
indians
of
the
north
was
to
be
finally
conquered
by
the
white
man
it
had
been
left
practically
unexplored
ever
since
the
days
when
the
bloodthirsty
koyukons
came
down
out
of
their
fastnesses
and
perpetrated
the
great
nulato
massacre
doing
to
death
with
ghastly
barbarity
every
man
woman
and
child
at
the
post
russian
or
indian
except
kurilla
not
sparing
the
unlucky
captain
barnard
or
his
english
escort
newly
arrived
here
in
their
search
for
the
lost
sir
john
franklin
but
the
tables
were
turned
now
and
the
white
man
was
on
the
trail
of
the
indian
while
the
colonel
and
the
boy
were
staking
out
this
future
stronghold
of
trade
and
civilisation
it
came
on
to
snow
but
ca
last
this
time
o
year
the
colonel
consoled
himself
and
thanked
god
the
big
unending
snows
are
over
for
this
season
so
they
pushed
on
but
the
colonel
seemed
to
have
thanked
god
prematurely
down
the
snow
drifted
soft
sticky
unending
the
evening
was
cloudy
and
the
snow
increased
the
dimness
overhead
as
well
as
the
heaviness
under
foot
they
never
knew
just
where
it
was
in
the
hours
between
dusk
and
dark
that
they
lost
the
trail
the
boy
believed
it
was
at
a
certain
steep
incline
that
nig
did
his
best
to
rush
down
i
thought
he
was
at
his
tricks
said
the
boy
ruefully
some
hours
after
i
believe
i
an
ass
and
nig
is
a
gentleman
and
a
scholar
he
knew
perfectly
what
he
was
about
reckon
we
camp
pardner
reckon
we
might
as
well
after
unharnessing
the
dogs
the
boy
stood
an
instant
looking
enviously
at
them
as
he
thawed
out
his
stiff
hands
under
his
parki
exhausted
and
smoking
hot
the
dogs
had
curled
down
in
the
snow
as
as
though
on
a
before
a
fire
sheltering
their
sharp
noses
with
their
tails
wish
i
had
a
tail
to
shelter
my
face
said
the
boy
as
if
a
tail
were
the
one
thing
lacking
to
complete
his
bliss
you
do
need
any
shelter
answered
the
colonel
your
face
is
gettin
well
and
he
stopped
suddenly
carried
back
to
those
black
days
when
he
had
vainly
urged
a
he
unpacked
their
few
possessions
and
watched
the
boy
take
the
axe
and
go
off
for
wood
stopping
on
his
way
tired
as
he
was
to
pull
nig
pointed
ears
the
odd
thing
about
the
boy
was
that
it
was
only
with
these
indian
curs
nig
in
particular
who
was
the
boy
dog
at
all
only
with
these
had
he
seemed
to
recover
something
of
that
buoyancy
and
ridiculous
youngness
that
had
first
drawn
the
colonel
to
him
on
the
voyage
up
from
it
was
also
clear
that
if
the
boy
now
drew
away
from
his
pardner
ever
so
little
by
so
much
did
he
draw
nearer
to
the
dogs
he
might
be
too
tired
to
answer
the
colonel
he
was
seldom
too
tired
to
talk
nonsense
to
nig
never
too
tired
to
say
well
old
boy
or
even
well
to
the
dumb
brute
it
was
perhaps
this
that
the
colonel
disliked
most
of
all
whether
the
agent
at
nulato
was
justified
or
not
in
saying
all
the
region
hereabouts
was
populous
in
the
summer
with
indian
camps
the
native
winter
settlements
the
ighloo
or
the
rude
where
for
a
little
tea
tobacco
or
sugar
you
could
get
as
much
fish
as
you
could
carry
these
welcome
if
malodorous
places
seemed
since
they
lost
the
trail
to
have
vanished
off
the
face
of
the
earth
no
question
of
the
men
sharing
the
dogs
fish
but
of
the
dogs
sharing
the
men
bacon
and
meal
that
night
the
meagre
supper
was
more
meagre
still
that
the
horses
might
have
something
too
the
next
afternoon
it
stopped
snowing
and
cleared
intensely
cold
and
that
was
the
evening
the
boy
nearly
cried
for
joy
when
lifting
up
his
eyes
he
saw
a
good
way
off
perched
on
the
river
bank
the
huts
and
high
caches
of
an
indian
village
etched
black
against
a
wintry
sunset
a
fine
picture
in
any
eye
but
meaning
more
than
beauty
to
the
driver
of
hungry
dogs
fish
nig
called
out
the
boy
to
his
leader
you
hear
me
you
nig
old
fellow
now
look
at
that
colonel
you
tell
me
that
indian
dog
does
understand
english
i
tell
you
what
we
had
a
mean
time
with
these
dogs
just
at
first
but
that
was
only
because
we
understand
one
another
the
colonel
preserved
a
reticent
air
you
come
to
my
way
of
thinking
yet
the
indian
dog
he
a
daisy
glad
you
think
so
the
colonel
with
some
display
of
temper
had
given
up
trying
to
drive
the
team
only
half
an
hour
before
and
was
still
rather
sore
about
it
when
you
get
to
him
persisted
the
boy
he
the
most
marvellous
little
horse
ever
hitched
in
harness
he
pulls
pulls
pulls
all
day
long
in
any
kind
o
weather
yes
pulls
you
off
your
legs
or
pulls
you
the
way
you
do
want
to
go
oh
that
when
you
rile
him
he
just
like
any
other
american
gentleman
he
got
his
feelin
ai
you
got
feelin
nig
huh
rather
i
tell
you
what
colonel
many
a
time
when
i
pretty
well
beat
and
ready
to
snap
at
anybody
i
looked
at
nig
peggin
away
like
a
little
man
on
a
rotten
trail
with
a
blizzard
in
his
eyes
and
just
made
me
sick
after
that
to
hear
myself
grumblin
yes
sir
the
indian
dog
is
an
example
to
any
white
man
on
the
trail
the
boy
seemed
not
to
relinquish
the
hope
of
stirring
the
tired
colonel
to
enthusiasm
do
you
like
the
way
after
the
worst
sort
of
day
when
you
stop
he
just
drops
down
in
the
snow
and
rolls
about
a
little
to
rest
his
muscles
and
then
lies
there
as
patient
as
anything
till
you
are
ready
to
unharness
him
and
feed
him
and
if
you
do
hurry
up
he
saves
you
the
trouble
of
unharnessing
by
eating
the
traces
and
things
humph
so
would
you
if
that
village
were
in
sight
if
you
were
sure
the
harness
would
stick
in
your
gizzard
and
think
of
what
a
dog
gets
to
reward
him
for
his
plucky
day
one
dried
salmon
or
a
little
when
he
off
on
a
holiday
like
this
works
without
a
and
keeps
in
good
flesh
on
one
fish
a
day
does
even
get
anything
to
drink
eats
a
little
snow
after
dinner
digs
his
bed
and
sleeps
in
a
drift
till
morning
when
he
does
howl
all
night
oh
that
when
he
meets
his
friends
and
they
talk
about
old
times
before
they
came
down
in
the
world
hey
yes
when
they
were
wolves
and
made
us
run
instead
of
our
making
them
make
any
fellow
howl
instead
of
carrying
our
food
about
we
used
to
carry
theirs
and
run
hard
to
keep
from
giving
it
up
too
nig
at
it
again
said
the
colonel
give
us
your
whip
no
said
the
boy
i
begin
to
see
now
why
he
stops
and
goes
for
red
like
that
hah
spot
gettin
it
too
this
time
they
have
been
pullin
properly
you
just
notice
if
they
are
doin
their
share
nig
turn
to
every
time
and
give
columbia
you
see
when
he
freshened
up
a
bit
we
have
on
a
dead
run
the
boy
laughed
and
cracked
his
whip
they
got
keen
noses
do
smell
the
village
this
time
come
on
nig
spot
had
enough
he
sorry
good
and
plenty
cheer
up
spot
fish
old
man
you
hear
me
talkin
to
you
red
caches
full
of
it
whoop
and
down
they
rushed
men
and
dogs
tearing
along
like
mad
across
the
frozen
river
and
never
slowing
till
it
came
to
the
stiff
pull
up
the
opposite
bank
funny
i
do
hear
any
dogs
panted
the
boy
they
came
out
upon
a
place
silent
as
the
dead
a
big
deserted
village
emptied
by
the
plague
or
maybe
only
by
the
winter
caches
emptied
too
not
a
salmon
not
a
pike
not
a
lusk
not
even
a
whitefish
left
behind
it
was
a
bitter
blow
they
did
say
anything
it
was
too
bad
to
talk
about
the
colonel
made
the
fire
and
fried
a
little
bacon
and
made
some
mush
that
was
their
dinner
the
were
boiled
in
the
with
a
great
deal
of
snow
and
a
little
meal
and
the
soup
so
concocted
was
set
out
to
cool
for
the
dogs
they
were
afraid
to
sleep
in
one
of
the
cabins
it
might
be
the
indians
had
cut
all
the
spruce
for
a
wide
radius
round
about
no
boughs
to
make
a
bed
they
hoisted
some
up
into
one
of
the
empty
caches
laid
them
side
by
side
and
on
this
bed
dry
if
hard
they
found
oblivion
the
next
morning
a
thin
powdery
snow
was
driving
about
had
they
lost
their
way
in
the
calendar
as
well
as
on
the
trail
and
was
it
december
instead
of
the
of
march
the
colonel
sat
on
the
packed
sled
undoing
with
stiff
fingers
the
twisted
frozen
rope
he
knew
the
axe
that
he
used
the
night
before
on
the
little
end
of
bacon
was
lying
pressed
into
the
snow
under
one
runner
but
that
was
the
last
thing
to
go
on
the
pack
before
the
lashing
and
it
would
get
lost
pinned
down
under
the
sled
nig
caught
sight
of
it
and
came
over
with
a
cheerful
air
of
interest
sniffed
bacon
on
the
steel
and
it
occurred
to
him
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
lick
it
a
bitter
howling
broke
the
stillness
the
boy
came
tearing
up
with
a
look
that
lifted
the
colonel
off
the
sled
and
there
was
nig
trying
to
get
away
from
the
his
tongue
frozen
fast
to
the
steel
and
pulled
horribly
long
out
of
his
mouth
like
a
little
pink
rope
the
boy
had
fallen
upon
the
agonized
beast
and
forced
him
down
close
to
the
steel
holding
him
there
between
his
knees
he
pulled
off
his
outer
mits
and
with
hands
and
breath
warmed
the
surface
of
the
axe
speaking
now
and
then
to
the
dog
who
howled
wretchedly
but
seemed
to
understand
something
was
being
done
for
him
since
he
gave
up
struggling
when
at
last
the
boy
got
him
free
the
little
horse
pressed
against
his
friend
legs
with
a
strange
new
shuddering
noise
very
pitiful
to
hear
the
boy
blinking
hard
said
yes
old
man
i
know
that
was
a
mean
breakfast
and
he
patted
the
shaggy
chest
nig
bent
his
proud
head
and
licked
the
rescuing
hand
with
his
bleeding
tongue
an
you
say
that
dog
has
got
feelin
they
hitched
the
team
and
pushed
on
in
the
absence
of
a
trail
the
best
they
could
do
was
to
keep
to
the
river
ice
can
you
see
the
river
bank
i
not
sure
said
the
boy
i
thought
you
were
going
it
blind
i
believe
i
better
let
nig
have
his
head
said
the
boy
stopping
he
the
dandy
nig
old
man
i
takes
off
my
hat
to
you
they
pushed
ahead
till
the
dogs
gave
out
they
camped
under
the
lee
of
the
propped
sled
and
slept
the
sleep
of
exhaustion
the
next
morning
dawned
clear
and
warm
the
colonel
managed
to
get
a
little
wood
and
started
a
fire
there
were
a
few
spoonfuls
of
meal
in
the
bottom
of
the
bag
and
a
little
end
of
bacon
mostly
rind
the
sort
of
soup
the
dogs
had
had
yesterday
was
good
enough
for
men
the
hot
and
watery
brew
gave
them
strength
enough
to
strike
camp
and
move
on
the
elder
man
began
to
say
to
himself
that
he
would
sell
his
life
dearly
he
looked
at
the
dogs
a
good
deal
and
then
would
look
at
the
boy
but
he
could
never
catch
his
eye
at
last
they
say
you
know
that
men
in
our
fix
have
sometimes
had
to
sacrifice
a
dog
ugh
the
boy
face
expressed
nausea
at
the
thought
yes
it
is
pretty
revolting
we
could
never
do
it
said
the
colonel
the
three
little
esquimaux
horses
were
not
only
very
hungry
their
feet
were
in
a
bad
condition
and
were
bleeding
the
boy
had
shut
his
eyes
at
first
at
the
sight
of
their
red
tracks
in
the
snow
he
hardly
noticed
them
now
an
hour
or
so
later
better
men
than
we
says
the
colonel
significantly
have
had
to
put
their
feelings
in
their
pockets
as
if
he
found
the
observation
distinctly
discouraging
nig
at
this
moment
sat
down
in
the
melting
snow
and
no
amount
of
mushing
moved
him
let
give
him
half
an
hour
rest
colonel
valuable
beast
you
know
altogether
best
team
on
the
river
said
the
boy
as
if
to
show
that
his
suggestion
was
not
inspired
by
mere
pity
for
the
bleeding
dogs
and
you
look
rather
faded
yourself
colonel
sit
down
and
rest
nothing
more
was
said
for
a
full
till
the
colonel
taking
off
his
fur
hat
and
wiping
his
beaded
forehead
on
the
back
of
his
hand
remarked
think
of
the
siege
of
paris
eh
what
the
boy
stared
as
if
afraid
his
partner
brain
had
given
way
when
the
horses
gave
out
they
had
to
eat
dogs
cats
rats
even
think
of
it
rats
the
french
are
a
dirty
lot
let
mush
colonel
i
as
fit
as
a
fiddle
the
boy
got
up
and
called
the
dogs
in
ten
minutes
they
were
following
the
blind
trail
again
but
the
sled
kept
clogging
sticking
fast
and
breaking
down
after
a
desperate
bout
of
ineffectual
pulling
the
dogs
with
one
mind
stopped
again
and
lay
down
in
their
bloody
tracks
the
men
stood
silent
for
a
moment
then
the
colonel
remarked
red
is
the
least
valuable
a
long
pause
but
nig
feet
are
in
the
worst
condition
that
dog
wo
travel
a
mile
further
well
added
the
colonel
after
a
bit
as
the
boy
stood
speechless
studying
the
team
what
do
you
say
me
he
looked
up
like
a
man
who
has
been
dreaming
and
is
just
awake
oh
i
should
say
our
friend
nig
here
has
had
to
stand
more
than
his
share
of
the
racket
poor
old
nig
said
the
colonel
with
a
somewhat
guilty
air
look
here
what
do
you
say
to
seeing
whether
they
can
go
if
we
help
with
that
load
good
for
you
colonel
said
the
boy
with
confidence
wonderfully
restored
i
was
just
thinking
the
same
they
unlashed
the
pack
and
the
colonel
wanted
to
make
two
bundles
of
the
bedding
and
things
but
whether
the
boy
really
thought
the
colonel
was
giving
out
or
whether
down
in
some
corner
of
his
mind
he
recognised
the
fact
that
if
the
colonel
were
not
galled
by
this
extra
burden
he
might
feel
his
hunger
less
and
so
be
less
prone
to
thoughts
of
poor
nig
in
the
pot
however
it
was
he
said
the
bundle
was
his
business
for
the
first
hour
so
the
colonel
did
the
driving
and
the
boy
tramped
on
ahead
breaking
trail
with
pounds
on
his
back
and
he
did
give
it
up
either
though
he
admitted
long
after
it
was
the
toughest
time
he
had
ever
put
in
in
all
his
life
have
you
had
about
enough
of
this
the
colonel
sang
out
at
dusk
pretty
nearly
said
the
boy
in
a
rather
weak
voice
he
flung
off
the
pack
and
sat
on
it
get
up
says
the
colonel
give
us
the
when
it
was
undone
the
norfolk
jacket
dropped
out
he
rolled
it
up
against
the
sled
flung
himself
down
and
heavily
dropped
his
head
on
the
rough
pillow
but
he
sprang
up
what
yes
by
the
lord
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
capacious
pocket
of
the
jacket
and
pulled
out
some
broken
ship
biscuit
hard
tack
by
the
living
jingo
he
was
up
had
a
few
sticks
alight
and
the
kettle
on
and
was
melting
snow
to
pour
on
the
broken
biscuit
it
swells
you
know
like
thunder
the
boy
was
still
sitting
on
the
bundle
of
trade
tea
and
tobacco
he
seemed
not
to
hear
he
seemed
not
to
see
the
colonel
shakily
hovering
about
the
fire
pushing
aside
the
green
wood
and
adding
a
few
sticks
of
dry
there
was
a
mist
before
the
colonel
eyes
reaching
after
a
bit
of
seasoned
spruce
he
stumbled
and
unconsciously
set
his
foot
on
bleeding
paw
the
dog
let
out
a
yell
and
flew
at
him
the
colonel
fell
back
with
an
oath
picked
up
a
stick
and
laid
it
on
the
boy
was
on
his
feet
in
a
flash
here
stop
that
he
jumped
in
between
the
infuriated
man
and
the
infuriated
dog
stand
back
roared
the
colonel
it
was
your
fault
you
trod
stand
back
damn
you
or
you
get
hurt
the
stick
would
have
fallen
on
the
boy
he
dodged
it
calling
excitedly
come
here
nig
here
he
my
dog
and
i
lamm
him
if
i
like
you
the
colonel
see
just
where
the
boy
and
the
culprit
were
stumbling
a
few
paces
away
from
the
glare
of
the
fire
he
called
out
i
kill
that
brute
if
he
snaps
at
me
again
oh
yes
the
boy
voice
rang
passionately
out
of
the
gloom
i
know
you
want
him
killed
the
colonel
sat
down
heavily
on
the
bag
presently
the
bubbling
of
boiling
roused
him
he
got
up
divided
the
biscuit
and
poured
the
hot
water
over
the
fragments
then
he
sat
down
again
and
waited
for
them
to
swell
like
thunder
he
could
see
where
a
little
way
up
the
hillside
the
boy
sat
on
a
fallen
tree
with
nig
head
under
his
arm
the
boy
felt
pretty
low
in
his
mind
he
sat
crouched
together
with
his
head
sunk
almost
to
his
knees
it
was
a
lonely
kind
of
a
world
after
all
doing
your
level
best
did
seem
to
get
you
any
forrader
what
was
the
use
he
started
something
warm
caressing
touched
his
cold
face
just
under
one
eye
nig
tongue
good
old
nig
you
feel
lonesome
too
he
gathered
the
rough
beast
up
closer
to
him
just
then
the
colonel
called
nig
sh
sh
lie
quiet
whispered
the
boy
nig
nig
good
old
boy
stay
here
he
does
mean
well
by
you
quiet
i
say
nig
and
the
treacherous
colonel
gave
the
peculiar
whistle
both
men
used
to
call
the
dogs
to
supper
the
dog
struggled
to
get
away
the
boy
stiff
fingers
lost
their
grip
and
the
best
leader
in
the
yukon
was
running
down
the
bank
as
hard
as
he
could
pelt
to
the
camp
fire
to
the
the
boy
got
up
and
floundered
away
in
the
opposite
direction
he
must
get
out
of
hearing
he
toiled
on
listening
for
the
expected
gunshot
hearing
it
too
and
the
yawp
of
a
wounded
dog
in
spite
of
a
mitten
clapped
at
each
ear
that
the
kind
of
world
it
is
do
your
level
best
drag
other
packs
hundreds
o
miles
over
the
ice
with
a
hungry
belly
and
bloody
feet
and
then
poor
old
nig
you
lame
poor
old
nig
with
a
tightened
throat
and
hot
water
in
his
eyes
he
kept
on
repeating
the
dog
name
as
he
stumbled
forward
in
the
snow
nev
mind
old
boy
it
a
lonely
kind
o
world
and
the
right
trail
hard
to
find
suddenly
he
stood
still
his
stumbling
feet
were
on
a
track
he
had
reached
the
dip
in
the
of
the
hill
and
yes
this
was
the
trail
for
down
on
the
other
side
below
him
were
faint
lights
huts
an
indian
village
with
fish
and
food
for
everybody
and
nig
nig
was
being
the
boy
turned
as
if
a
hurricane
had
struck
him
and
tore
back
down
the
incline
stumbling
floundering
in
the
snow
calling
hoarsely
colonel
colonel
do
do
it
there
a
village
here
colonel
nig
colonel
do
do
it
he
dashed
into
the
circle
of
firelight
and
beheld
nig
standing
with
a
bandaged
paw
placidly
eating
softened
biscuit
out
of
the
family
it
was
short
work
getting
down
to
the
village
they
had
one
king
salmon
and
two
white
fish
from
the
first
indian
they
saw
who
wanted
hootch
for
them
and
got
only
tabak
in
the
biggest
of
the
huts
nearly
full
of
men
women
and
children
coughing
dejected
the
natives
made
room
for
the
strangers
when
the
white
men
had
supped
they
handed
over
the
remains
of
their
meal
as
is
expected
to
the
head
of
the
house
this
and
a
few
matches
or
a
little
tobacco
on
parting
is
all
he
looks
for
in
return
for
shelter
room
for
beds
on
the
floor
laboriously
melted
use
of
the
fire
and
as
much
wood
as
they
like
to
burn
even
if
it
is
a
barren
place
and
fuel
is
the
precious
drift
it
is
curious
to
see
how
soon
travellers
get
past
that
first
cheeckalko
feeling
that
it
is
a
little
nervy
as
the
boy
had
said
to
walk
into
another
man
house
uninvited
an
absolute
stranger
and
take
possession
of
everything
you
want
without
so
much
as
by
your
leave
you
soon
learn
it
is
the
siwash
custom
footnote
siwash
corruption
of
applied
all
over
the
north
to
the
natives
their
possessions
and
their
customs
nothing
would
have
seemed
stranger
now
or
more
inhuman
than
the
civilized
point
of
view
the
indians
trailed
out
one
by
one
all
except
the
old
buck
to
whom
the
hut
belonged
he
hung
about
for
a
bit
till
he
was
satisfied
the
travellers
had
no
hootch
not
even
a
little
for
the
head
of
the
house
and
yet
they
seemed
to
be
fairly
decent
fellows
then
he
rolls
up
his
blankets
for
there
is
a
premium
on
and
goes
out
with
never
a
notion
that
he
is
doing
more
than
any
man
would
anywhere
in
the
world
to
find
a
place
in
some
neighbour
hut
to
pass
the
night
he
leaves
the
two
strangers
as
indian
hospitality
ordains
to
the
warmest
places
in
the
best
hut
with
two
young
squaws
one
old
one
and
five
children
all
sleeping
together
on
the
floor
as
a
matter
of
course
the
colonel
and
the
boy
had
flung
themselves
down
on
top
of
their
fed
and
warmed
and
comforted
only
the
old
squaw
was
still
up
she
had
been
looking
over
the
travellers
boots
and
mitts
and
now
without
a
word
or
even
a
look
being
exchanged
upon
the
subject
she
sat
there
in
the
corner
by
the
dim
light
sewing
on
new
thongs
patching
up
holes
and
making
the
strange
men
tidy
men
she
had
never
seen
before
and
would
never
see
again
and
this
no
tribute
to
the
colonel
generosity
or
the
youth
and
friendly
manners
of
the
boy
they
knew
the
old
squaw
would
have
done
just
the
same
had
the
mucklucks
and
the
mitts
belonged
to
the
tramp
of
the
yukon
with
nothing
to
barter
and
not
a
cent
in
his
pocket
this
again
is
a
siwash
custom
the
old
squaw
coughed
and
wiped
her
eyes
the
children
coughed
in
their
sleep
the
dogs
outside
were
howling
like
human
beings
put
to
torture
but
the
sound
no
longer
had
power
to
freeze
the
blood
of
the
the
colonel
merely
damned
them
the
boy
lifted
his
head
and
listened
for
nig
note
the
battle
raged
nearer
a
great
scampering
went
by
the
tent
nig
a
scuffling
and
snuffing
round
the
bottom
of
the
tent
the
boy
on
a
sudden
impulse
reached
out
and
lifted
the
flap
got
your
bandage
on
come
here
nig
brisked
in
with
the
air
of
one
having
very
little
time
to
waste
lord
i
should
think
you
be
glad
to
lie
down
am
let
see
your
paw
here
come
over
to
the
light
he
stepped
very
carefully
over
the
feet
of
the
other
inhabitants
till
he
reached
the
old
woman
corner
nig
following
calmly
walked
on
prostrate
bodies
till
he
reached
his
friend
now
your
paw
pardner
bad
ai
it
he
appealed
to
the
toothless
squaw
her
best
friend
could
not
have
said
her
wizened
regard
was
exactly
sympathetic
but
it
was
attentive
she
seemed
intelligent
as
well
as
kind
look
here
whispered
the
boy
let
that
muckluck
string
o
mine
alone
he
drew
it
away
and
dropped
it
between
his
knees
have
you
got
something
or
other
to
make
some
shoes
for
nig
hein
he
pantomimed
but
she
only
stared
like
this
he
pulled
out
his
knife
and
cut
off
the
end
of
one
leg
of
his
shaps
and
gathered
it
gently
round
nig
nearest
foot
little
see
give
you
some
bully
tabak
if
you
do
that
for
nig
hein
she
nodded
at
last
and
made
a
queer
wheezy
sound
whether
friendly
laughing
or
pure
scorn
the
boy
was
sure
but
she
set
about
the
task
come
nig
he
whispered
you
just
see
if
i
do
shoe
my
little
horse
and
he
sneaked
back
to
bed
comfortable
in
the
assurance
that
the
colonel
was
asleep
nig
came
walking
after
his
friend
straight
over
people
heads
one
of
the
children
sat
up
and
whimpered
the
colonel
growled
sleepily
you
black
devil
admonished
the
boy
under
his
breath
look
what
you
about
come
here
sir
he
pushed
the
devil
down
between
the
and
the
nearest
baby
the
colonel
gave
a
distinct
grunt
of
disapproval
and
then
that
brute
in
here
he
a
lot
cleaner
than
our
friends
said
the
boy
sharply
as
if
answering
an
insult
right
said
the
colonel
with
conviction
his
pardner
was
instantly
mollified
if
you
wake
another
baby
get
a
lickin
he
said
genially
to
the
dog
and
then
he
stretched
out
his
feet
till
they
reached
nig
back
and
a
feeling
of
great
comfort
came
over
the
boy
say
colonel
he
yawned
luxuriously
did
you
know
that
a
when
nig
flared
up
did
you
know
you
trodden
on
his
paw
did
know
it
till
you
told
me
growled
the
colonel
i
thought
you
did
makes
a
difference
does
it
you
need
think
says
the
colonel
a
little
defiantly
that
weakened
on
the
main
point
just
because
i
choose
to
give
nig
a
few
cracker
crumbs
if
it
a
question
between
a
man
life
and
a
life
only
a
sentimental
fool
would
hesitate
i
not
talking
about
that
we
can
get
fish
now
what
i
pointin
out
is
that
nig
did
fly
at
you
for
nothin
he
got
a
devil
of
a
temper
that
dog
it
just
like
nicholas
of
pymeut
said
the
boy
sat
up
eager
in
his
advocacy
and
earnest
as
a
judge
nicholas
of
pymeut
said
treat
a
siwash
like
a

with

to

the
indians
guided
them
back
to
the
trail
the
colonel
and
the
boy
made
good
speed
to
novikakat
laid
in
supplies
at
korkorines
heard
the
first
doubtful
account
of
min√≥ok
at
tanana
and
pushed
on
past
camps
stoneman
and
woodworth
where
the
great
klondyke
expeditions
lay
fast
in
the
ice
along
the
white
strip
of
the
narrowing
river
pent
in
now
between
mountains
black
with
scant
subarctic
timber
or
gray
with
fantastic
rock
on
and
on
till
they
reached
the
bluffs
of
the
lower
ramparts

at
last
between
the
ranks
of

jauntily
on

up

out
of

coming

when

the

for
the
name
was
still
undetermined
in
the
spring
of
it
was
a
great
moment
shake
pardner
said
the
boy
the
colonel
and
he
grasped
hands
only
towering
good
spirits
prevented
their
being
haughty
for
they
felt
like
conquerors
and
cared
not
a
jot
that
they
looked
like
it
was
two
in
the
morning
the
gold
nugget
saloon
was
flaring
with
light
and
a
pianola
was
perforating
a
tune
the
travellers
pushed
open
a
frosted
door
and
looked
into
a
long
low
room
hung
with
many
kerosene
lamps
and
heated
by
a
great
iron
stove
hello
said
a
man
in
mackinaws
smoking
near
the
of
the
bar

looked

and
seeing
the
strangers
through
the
stopped
laughing
to
stare
down
from

asked
the
bartender
hurrying
forward
a
magnificent
creature
in
a
check
waistcoat

and
a
diamond
pin
no

about
up
from
the
lower
river
oh

i
guess

a
thirst
on
you
said
the
man
in
the
mackinaws
come
and
licker
up
the
bartender
mixed
the
drinks
in
style
shooting
the
liquor
from
a
height
into
the
small
glasses
with
the
dexterity
that
had
made
him
famous
when
their
tired
eyes
had
got
accustomed
to
the
mingled
smoke
and
glare
the
travellers
could
see
that
in
the
space
beyond
the
card
tables
in
those
back
regions
where
the
pianola
reigned
there
were
several
couples
twirling
about
the
miners
pirouetting
with
an
astonishing
lightness
on
their
moccasined
feet
and
women
white
women
they
stopped
dancing
and
came
forward
to
see
the
new
arrivals
the
mackinaw
man
was
congratulating
the
colonel
on
gettin
back
to
civilization
see
that
mirror
he
pointed
behind
the
bar
below
the
moose
antlers
see
them
ladies

got
to
a
place
where
you
can
rake
in
the
dust
all

and
dance

the
tiger
between

he
took
up
the
last
of
the
gin
slings
set
in
a
row
before
the
party
have
you
got
some
property
here
asked
the
boy
the
man
without
putting
down
his
glass
simply
closed
one
eye
over
the
rim
we
heard
some
bad
accounts
of
these
diggin
said
the
colonel
i
ai
sayin
there
millions
for
you
got
to
get
the
inside
track
see
that
feller
talkin
to
the
girl
billy
nebrasky
tipped
him
the
wink
in
time
to
git
the
inside
track
just
before
the
fall
stampede
up
the
gulch
which
gulch
he
only
motioned
with
his
head
through
havin
that
tip
he
got
there
in
time
to
stake
number
three
below
discovery
he
had
to
hang
up
drinks
all
winter
but
he
a
millionaire
all
right
he
got
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
sight
only
waitin
for
runnin
water
to
wash
it
out
then
there
gold
about
here
there
is
gold
say
maudie
he
remarked
in
a
humourous
to
the
young
woman
who
was
passing
with
no
this
fellow
wants
to
know
if
there
is
gold
here
she
laughed
guess
he
ai
been
here
long
now
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
this
rejoinder
was
susceptible
of
more
than
one
interpretation
but
the
mackinaw
man
seemed
satisfied
so
much
so
that
he
offered
maudie
the
second
which
the
colonel
had
ordered
all
round
she
eyed
the
strangers
over
the
glass
on
the
hand
that
held
it
a
fine
diamond
sparkled
you
would
say
she
was
but
you
would
have
been
sure
she
had
seemed
at
least
that
at
a
distance
now
she
looked
rather
younger
the
face
wore
an
impudent
look
yet
it
was
delicate
too
her
skin
showed
very
white
and
fine
under
the
dabs
of
rouge
the
blueness
was
not
yet
faded
out
of
her
restless
eyes
min√≥ok
all
right
no
josh
about
that
she
said
setting
down
her
glass
then
to
the
boy
have
a
dance
not
much
he
replied
rather
roughly
and
turned
away
to
talk
about
the
diggin
to
two
men
on
the
other
side
maudie
laid
her
hand
on
the
colonel
arm
and
the
diamond
twitched
the
light
will
she
said
well
you
see
the
colonel
smile
was
charming
in
spite
of
his
wild
beard
we
done
such
a
lot
o

mackinaw
man

pretty
good
thing

the
boy
turned
his
head
round
again
with
reviving
interest
in
his
own
group
look
here
si
maudie
was
saying
if
you
want
to
let
a
lay
on
your
new
claim

mind

got
to
be
me
but
the
mackinaw
man
was
glancing
speculatively
over
at
another
group
in
haste
to
forestall
desertion
the
boy
inquired
do

of
anything
good
that

staked

well
mebbe

drawstring
of
his
gold
sack
maudie
said
but
whether
to
the
colonel
or
the
boy
neither
could
tell

do
worse
than
keep
your
eye
on
si
mcginty
she
nodded
briskly
at
the
violet
checks
on
the
mackinaw
back
si
got
a
cinch
up
there
on
glory
hallelujah
and
nobody
on
to
it
yet
the
pianola
picked
out
a
polka
the
man
si
mcginty
had
called
french
charlie
came
up
behind
the
girl
and
said
something
she
shook
her
head
turned
on
her
heel
and
began
circling
about
in
the
narrow
space
till
she
found
another
partner
french
charlie
scowling
after
them
as
they
whirled
away
between
the
back
into
the
smoke
and
music
at
the
rear
mcginty
was
watching
jimmie
the
man
at
the
gold
scales
pinch
up
some
of
the
excess
dust
in
the
and
toss
it
back
into
the
brass
blower
where
did
that
gold
come
from
asked
the
colonel
off
a
claim
o
mine
and
he
lapsed
into
silence
you
are
always
told
these
fellows
are
so
anxious
to
rope
in
strangers
this
man
did
seem
to
be
it
made
him
very
interesting
the
boy
acted
strictly
on
the
woman
hint
and
kept
an
eye
on
the
person
who
had
a
sure
thing
up
on
glory
hallelujah
but
when
the
lucky
man
next
opened
his
mouth
it
was
to
say
why
there
butts
down
from
circle
city

repeated
the
boy
with
little
affectation
of
interest
yep

he
spoke
genially
even
with
respect
who
butts
butts
ah

a
butts

the
smartest
fellow
with
his
fingers

mcginty
showed
his
big
yellow
teeth
in
an
appreciative
smile
smart
at
washin
gold
out
smarter
at
pickin
it
out
the
bartender

there
was
a
noise
about
the
door
someone
bustled
in
with
a
torrent
of
talk
and
the
pianola
was
drowned
in
a
pandemonium
of
shouts
and
laughter
windy
jim
reely
got
back
everybody
crowded
forward
maudie
was
at
the
colonel
elbow
explaining
that
the
little
man
with
the
red
nose
was
the
he
had
made
a
contract
early
in
the
winter
to
go
to
dawson
and
bring
down
the
mail
for
min√≥ok
his
agreement
was
to
make
the
round
trip
and
be
back
by
the
middle
of
february
since
early
march
the
standing
gag
in
the
camp
had
been
well
windy
jim
got
in
last
night
the
mild
jest
had
grown
stale
and
the
denizens
of
min√≥ok
had
given
up
the
hope
of
ever
laying
eyes
on
windy
again
when
lo
here
he
was
with
hundred
letters
in
his
sack
the
patrons
of
the
gold
nugget
crowded
round
him
like
flies
round
a
lump
of
sugar
glad
to
pay
a
dollar
apiece
on
each
letter
he
handed
out
and
you
take
addressed
to
yer
at
that
price
or
you
get
none
every
letter
there
had
come
over
the
terrible
pass
every
one
had
travelled
twelve
hundred
miles
by
and
some
had
been
on
the
trail
seven
months
here
maudie
me
dear
the
postman
handed
her
two
letters
see
how
he
dotes
on
yer
got
anything
fur
what
yer
names
says
the
mackinaw
man
who
seemed
to
have
adopted
the
colonel
and
the
boy
he
presented
them
without
embarrassment
to
windy
jim
wilson
of
junction
the
best
trail
in
the
states
those
who
had
already
got
letters
were
gathered
in
groups
under
the
reading
eagerly
in
the
midst
of
the
lull
of
satisfaction
or
expectancy
someone
cried
out
in
disgust
and
another
threw
down
a
letter
with
a
shower
of
objurgation
guess
you
got
the
mate
to
mine
bonsor
said
a
bystander
with
a
laugh
slowly
tearing
up
the
communication
he
had
opened
with
fingers
so
eager
that
they
shook
you
pay
a
dollar
apiece
for
letters
from
folks
you
never
heard
of
asking
you
what
you
think
of
the
country
and
whether
you
advise
to
come
out
huh
do
i
wish
they
would
it
all
right
and
then
trust
bonsor
to
git
even
salaman
the
luckiest
man
in
camp
who
had
come
in
from
his
valuable
little
min√≥ok
property
for
the
night
only
had
to
pay
fifteen
dollars
for
his
mail
when
he
opened
it
he
found
he
had
one
home
letter
written
seven
months
before
eight
notes
of
inquiry
and
six
advertisements
maudie
had
put
her
letters
unopened
in
her
pocket
and
told
the
man
at
the
scales
to
weigh
out
two
dollars
to
windy
and
charge
to
her
then
she
began
to
talk
to
the
colonel
the
boy
observed
with
scant
patience
that
his
pardner
treated
maudie
with
a
consideration
he
could
hardly
have
bettered
had
she
been
the
first
lady
in
the
land
must
be
because
she
little
and
the
colonel
a
sentimental
ol
goslin
what
makes
you
so
polite
to
that
girl
muttered
the
boy
aside
she
no
good
reckon
it
wo
make
her
any
better
for
me
to
be
impolite
to
her
returned
the
colonel
calmly
but
finding
she
could
not
detach
the
kentuckian
from
his
pardner
maudie
bestowed
her
attention
elsewhere
french
charlie
was
leaning
back
against
the
wall
his
hands
jammed
in
his
pockets
and
his
big
pulled
over
his
brows
under
the
shadow
of
the
wide
brim
furtively
he
watched
the
girl
another
woman
came
up
and
asked
him
to
dance
he
shook
his
head
reckon
we
better
go
and
knock
up
blandford
keith
and
get
a
bed
suggested
the
boy
regretfully
looking
round
for
the
man
who
had
a
cinch
up
on
glory
hallelujah
and
would
tell
you
how
to
get
there
reckon
we
better
agreed
the
colonel
but
they
halted
near
windy
jim
who
was
refreshing
himself
and
at
the
same
time
telling
dawson
news
or
dawson
lies
as
the
company
evidently
thought
and
still
the
men
crowded
round
listening
greedily
just
as
everybody
devours
certain
public
prints
without
ceasing
to
impeach
their
veracity
lacking
newspapers
at
which
to
pish
and
pshaw
they
listened
to
windy
jim
disbelieving
the
only
unvarnished
tale
that
gentleman
had
ever
told
for
windy
with
the
instinct
knew
marvellous
enough
would
sound
the
bare
recital
of
those
awful
dawson
days
when
the
unprecedented
early
winter
stopped
the
provision
boats
at
circle
and
starvation
stared
the
klondyke
in
the
face
having
disposed
of
their
letters
the
miners
crowded
round
the
courier
to
hear
how
the
black
business
ended
matter
of
special
interest
to
min√≥ok
for
the
population
here
was
composed
chiefly
of
men
who
by
the
canadian
route
had
managed
to
get
to
dawson
in
the
autumn
in
the
early
days
of
the
famine
scare
and
who
after
someone
to
raid
the
great
stores
were
given
free
passage
down
the
river
on
the
last
two
steamers
to
run
when
the
ice
stopped
them
one
party
at
circle
the
other
at
fort
yukon
they
had
held
up
the
supply
boats
and
helped
themselves
under
the
noses
of
captain
ray
and
lieutenant
richardson
a
yes
sir
mcginty
had
explained
we
min√≥ok
boys
was
all
in
that
picnic
but
we
give
our
bond
to
pay
up
at
and
after
the
fun
was
over
we
dropped
down
here
he
pushed
nearer
to
windy
to
hear
how
it
had
fared
with
the
men
who
had
stayed
behind
in
the
klondyke
how
the
excitement
flamed
and
menaced
how
agent
hansen
of
the
alaska
commercial
company
greatest
of
the
importers
of
provisions
and
arctic
equipment
rushed
about
half
crazy
making
speeches
all
along
the
dawson
river
front
urging
the
men
to
fly
for
their
lives
back
to
the
states
or
up
to
circle
before
the
ice
stopped
moving
but
too
many
of
these
men
had
put
everything
they
had
on
earth
into
getting
here
too
many
had
abandoned
costly
outfits
on
the
awful
pass
or
in
the
boiling
eddies
of
the
white
horse
rapids
paying
any
price
in
money
or
in
pain
to
get
to
the
goldfields
before
navigation
closed
and
now
here
was
hansen
with
all
the
authority
of
the
shouting
wildly
quick
quick
go
up
or
down
it
a
race
for
life
windy
went
on
to
tell
how
the
horror
of
the
thing
dulled
the
men
how
they
stood
about
the
dawson
streets
helpless
as
cattle
paralysed
by
the
misery
that
had
overtaken
them
all
very
well
for
hansen
to
try
to
relieve
the
congestion
at
the
klondyke
the
poor
devils
knew
that
to
go
either
way
up
or
down
as
late
as
this
meant
death
then
it
was
whispered
how
captain
constantine
of
the
mounted
police
was
getting
ready
to
drive
every
man
out
of
the
klondyke
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
who
could
show
a
thousand
pounds
of
provisions
yet
most
of
the
klondykers
still
stood
about
dazed
silent
waiting
for
the
final
stroke
a
few
went
up
over
the
way
they
had
come
to
die
after
all
on
the
pass
and
some
went
down
their
white
despairing
faces
disappearing
round
the
klondyke
bend
as
they
drifted
with
the
grinding
ice
towards
the
arctic
circle
where
the
food
was
caught
in
the
floes
and
how
one
came
back
going
by
without
ever
turning
his
head
caring
not
a
jot
for
golden
dawson
serene
as
a
king
in
his
capital
solitary
stark
on
a
little
island
of
ice
lord
it
was
better
after
all
at
the
big
chimney
oh
it
was
so
bad
said
windy
cheerfully
about
the
time
one
the
big
companies
announced
they
was
sold
out
o
everything
but
sugar
and
a
couple
o
steamers
pushed
their
way
in
through
the
ice
after
all
just
as
old
healy
said
it
was
only
a
question
of
rations
and
proper
distribution
why
flour
fell
from
one
hundred
and
twenty
dollars
a
sack
to
fifty
and
there
a
big
new
strike
on
the
island
opposite
ensley
creek
they
call
it
monte
cristo
pay
runs
eight
dollars
to
the
pan
lord
dawson
the
greatest
gold
camp
on
the
globe
but
no
matter
what
befell
at
dawson
business
must
be
kept
brisk
at
min√≥ok
the
pianola
started
up
and
buckin
billy
who
called
the
dances
began
to
bawl
invitations
to
the
company
to
come
and
waltz
windy
interrupted
his
own
music
for
further
refreshment
pausing
an
instant
with
his
mouth
full
of
pie
to
say
congress
has
sent
out

expedition

returned
to
his
pie
talking
earnestly
with
butts
french
charlie
pushed
heavily
past
the
boy
on
his
way
to
the
bar
from
his
gait
it
was
clear
that
he
had
made
many
similar
visits
that
evening

his
thick
canadian
accent

twirling
about
with
the
handy
gentleman
who
seemed
as
accomplished
with
his
toes
as
he
was
reputed
to
be
with
his
fingers
he
came
up
with
her
presently
and
ordered
some
wine

muttered
charlie
in
drunken
appreciation

himself
against

wall
again
and
always
slipping
sideways

and
passes
something
to
french
charlie

tipsily
and
leaning

arm
makes
his
way
to
the

he
ordered
butts
pulled
up
the
string
of
his
poke
and
slipped
to
one
side
as
noise
reached
the
group
at
the
bar
of
a
commotion

the
other
end
of
the
saloon

the
proprietor
of

with
suspicion

stared
at

princely
offer
but
instantly
the
commotion
was
greater
than
ever
did
what
was
expected
of
them
especially
butts
they
flew
about
looking
in
possible
and
impossible
places
laughing
screaming
tumbling
over
one
another
in
the
midst
of
the
uproar
french
charlie

oh
she
looked
the
gratitude
she
could
not
on
the
instant
speak
in
the
midst
of
the
noise
and
movement
the
mackinaw
man
said
to
the
boy
do
know
as
you
care
to
see
my
new
prospect
hole
course
i
like
to
see
it
well

me
here
two
nothin
to
nobody
he
added
still
lower
we
do
want
to
get
overrun
before
we
recorded
the
boy
could
have
hugged
that
mackinaw
man
outside
it
was
broad
day
but
still
the
gold
nugget
lights
were
flaring
and
the
pianola
played
they
had
learned
from
the
bartender
where
to
find
blandford
keith
in
the
shack
in
the
camp
but
it
looks
good
to
me
said
the
boy
as
they
went
in
and
startled
keith
out
of
his
first
sleep
the
man
that
brings
you
letters
before
the
ice
goes
out
is
your
friend
keith
helped
them
to
bring
in
their
stuff
and
was
distinctly
troubled
because
the
travellers
would
take
his
bunk
they
borrowed
some
dry
blankets
and
went
to
sleep
on
the
floor
it
was
after
two
when
they
woke
in
a
panic
lest
the
mackinaw
man
should
have
gone
without
them
while
the
colonel
got
breakfast
the
boy
dashed
round
to
the
gold
nugget
found
si
mcginty
playing
craps
and
would
have
brought
him
back
in
triumph
to
breakfast
but
no
he
would
wait
down
yonder
below
the
gold
nugget
and
do
you
say
nothin
yit
about
where
we
goin
or
we
have
the
hull
town
at
our
heels
about
twelve
miles
back
in
the
mountains
is
a
little
gulch
that
makes
into
a
big
one
at
right
angles
that
the
pup
where
my
claim
is
the
what
little
creek
call
pups
here
down
in
the
desolate
hollow
a
ragged
a
tent
sagged
away
from
the
prevailing
wind
inside
they
found
that
the
canvas
was
a
mere
shelter
over
a
prospect
hole
a
rusty
stove
was
almost
buried
by
the
heap
of
earth
and
gravel
thrown
up
from
a
pit
several
feet
deep
this
is
a
winter
diggins
y
see
observed
the
mackinaw
man
with
pride
it
only
while
the
ground
is
froze
solid
you
can
do
this
kind
o
minin
i
had
to
burn
the
ground
clean
down
to
yes
sir
thawed
my
way
inch
by
inch
to
the
old
channel
well
and
what
have
you
found
we
pan
some
o
this
dirt
and
see
his
slow
caution
impressed
his
hearers
they
made
up
a
fire
melted
snow
and
half
filled
a
rusty
pan
with
gravel
and
soil
from
the
bottom
of
the
pit
know
how
to
pan
the
colonel
and
the
boy
took
turns
they
were
much
longer
at
it
than
they
ever
were
again
but
the
mackinaw
man
seemed
not
in
the
least
hurry
the
impatience
was
all
theirs
when
they
had
got
down
to
fine
sand
look
screamed
the
boy
by
the
lord
said
the
colonel
softly
is
that
looks
like
you
got
some
colours
there
gosh
then
i
ai
been
dreamin
after
all
hey
dreamin
what
look
look
that
why
i
brought
you
out
says
the
mackinaw
man
i
was
afraid
to
trust
my
senses
thought
i
was
gettin
wheels
in
my
head
lord
look
at
the
gold
they
took
about
a
dollar
and
twenty
cents
out
of
that
pan
now
see
here
you
jest
lay
low
about
this
strike
his
anxiety
seemed
intense
they
reassured
him
i
do
suppose
you
mind
our
taking
up
a
claim
apiece
next
you
pleaded
the
boy
since
the
law
do
allow
you
to
stake
more
one
oh
that
all
right
said
the
mackinaw
man
with
an
air
of
princely
generosity
and
i
do
mind
if
you
like
to
let
in
a
few
of
your
particular
pals
if
you
agree
to
help
me
organise
a
district
i
do
the
recordin
fur
ye
really
this
mackinaw
man
was
a
trump
the
colonel
took
dollars
out
of
a
roll
of
bills
and
handed
it
to
him
what
this
fur
for
bringing
us
out
for
giving
us
the
tip
i
make
it
more
but
till
i
get
to
dawson
oh
laughed
the
mackinaw
man
all
right
and
indifferently
he
tucked
the
bills
into
his
baggy
trousers
the
colonel
felt
keenly
the
inadequacy
of
giving
a
man
dollars
who
had
just
introduced
him
to
hundreds
of
thousands
and
who
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
own
but
it
was
only
on
account
the
colonel
staked
no
above
the
discovery
and
the
boy
was
in
the
act
of
staking
no
below
when
no
no
says
that
kind
mackinaw
man
the
heavier
gold
will
be
found
further
up
the
gulch
stake
no
above
and
he
told
them
natural
facts
about
that
no
after
expert
knowledge
could
ever
better
but
he
was
not
as
happy
as
a
man
should
be
who
has
just
struck
pay
fact
is
it
kind
of
upsettin
to
find
it
so
rich
here
give
you
leave
to
upset
me
that
way
all
day
y
see
i
bought
another
claim
over
yonder
where
i
done
a
lot
o
work
last
summer
and
fall
built
a
cabin
and
put
up
a
sluice
i
to
be
up
there
soon
as
the
ice
goes
out
do
see
how
i
got
time
to
do
my
assessment
here
too
wish
i
was
twins
why
do
you
sell
this
guess
i
have
to
part
with
a
share
in
it
he
sighed
and
looked
lovingly
into
the
hole
minin
an
awful
gamble
he
said
as
though
admonishing
si
mcginty
but
we
there
gold
just
there
the
colonel
and
the
boy
looked
at
their
claims
and
felt
the
pinch
of
uncertainty
what
do
you
want
for
a
share
in
your
claim
mr
mcginty
oh
well
as
i
say
i
let
it
go
reasonable
to
a
feller
who
do
the
assessment
on
account
o
my
having
that
other
property
say
three
thousand
dollars
the
colonel
shook
his
head
why
it
two
men
can
take
a
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
day
out
of
that
claim
without
outside
help
and
properly
worked
the
summer
ought
to
show
forty
thousand
dollars
on
the
way
home
mcginty
found
he
could
let
the
thing
go
for
two
thousand
spot
cash
make
it
quarter
shares
suggested
the
boy
thrilled
at
such
a
chance
and
the
colonel
and
i
together
raise
five
hundred
and
do
the
rest
of
the
assessment
work
for
you
but
they
were
nearly
back
at
min√≥ok
before
mcginty
said
well
i
twins
and
i
ca
personally
work
two
so
we
call
it
a
deal
and
the
money
passed
that
night
and
the
word
passed
too
to
an
of
a
western
state
and
his
satellites
newly
arrived
from
woodworth
and
to
a
party
of
men
just
down
from
circle
city
mcginty
seemed
more
inclined
to
share
his
luck
with
strangers
than
with
the
men
he
had
wintered
amongst
mean
lot
these
min√≥ok
fellers
but
the
return
of
the
and
so
large
a
party
from
quietly
staking
their
claims
roused
min√≥ok
to
a
sense
that
somethin
was
goin
on
by
mcginty
advice
the
strangers
called
a
secret
meeting
and
elected
mcginty
recorder
all
the
registered
their
properties
and
the
dates
of
location
the
recorder
gave
everybody
his
receipt
and
everybody
felt
it
was
cheap
at
five
dollars
then
the
meeting
proceeded
to
frame
a
code
of
laws
for
the
new
district
stipulating
the
number
of
feet
permitted
each
claim
being
rigidly
kept
by
mcginty
within
the
limits
provided
by
the
united
states
laws
on
the
subject
and
decreeing
the
amount
of
work
necessary
to
hold
a
claim
a
year
settling
questions
of
water
rights
etc
not
until
glory
hallelujah
gulch
was
a
mining
district
did
min√≥ok
in
general
know
what
was
in
the
wind
the
next
day
the
news
was
all
over
camp
if
mcginty
name
inspired
suspicion
the
colonel
and
the
reassured
the
colonel
in
particular
he
had
already
established
that
credit
that
came
so
easy
to
him
being
triumphantly
quoted
as
saying
glory
hallelujah
gulch
was
the
richest
placer
ever
struck
nobody
added
that
it
was
also
the
only
one
but
this
matter
of
a
stampede
is
not
controlled
by
reason
it
is
a
thing
of
the
nerves
while
you
are
ridiculing
someone
else
your
legs
are
carrying
you
off
on
the
same
errand
in
a
the
saloon
is
the
community
heart
however
little
a
man
cares
to
drink
or
to
dance
or
to
play
cards
he
goes
to
the
saloon
as
to
the
one
place
where
he
may
meet
his
fellows
do
business
and
hear
the
news
the
saloon
is
the
market
place
it
is
also
the
caf√©
the
theatre
the
club
the
stock
exchange
the
barber
shop
the
bank
in
short
you
might
as
well
be
dead
as
not
be
a
patron
of
the
gold
nugget
yet
neither
the
colonel
nor
the
boy
had
been
there
since
the
night
of
their
arrival
on
returning
from
that
first
triumphant
inspection
of
mcginty
diggings
the
colonel
had
been
handed
a
sealed
envelope
without
address
how
do
you
know
it
for
me
she
said
it
was
for
the
big
chap
answered
blandford
keith
the
colonel
read
to
the
gold
nugget
as
soon
as
you
get
this
and
hear
something
to
your
maudie
so
he
had
stayed
away
having
plenty
to
occupy
him
in
helping
to
organise
the
new
district
he
was
strolling
past
the
saloon
the
morning
after
the
secret
meeting
when
down
into
the
street
like
a
kingfisher
into
a
stream
maudie
darted
and
held
up
the
colonel
ai
you
had
my
letter
oh
a
yes
but
i
been
busy
guess
so
she
said
with
undisguised
scorn
where
si
mcginty
reckon
he
out
at
the
gulch
i
got
to
go
down
to
the
now
and
buy
some
grub
to
take
out
he
was
moving
on
take
where
she
followed
him
up
to
mcginty
gulch
what
for
why
to
live
on
while
my
pardner
and
i
do
the
assessment
work
then
it
true
mcginty
been
fillin
you
full
o
guff
the
colonel
looked
at
her
a
little
haughtily
see
here
i
ai
busy
as
a
rule
about
other
folks
funerals
but
she
looked
at
him
curiously
it
cold
here
come
in
a
minute
there
was
no
hint
of
vulgar
nonsense
but
something
very
earnest
in
the
pert
little
face
that
had
been
so
pretty
they
went
in
order
drinks
she
said
aside
and
do
talk
before
jimmie
she
chaffed
the
bartender
and
leaned
idly
against
the
counter
when
a
group
of
returned
stampeders
came
in
she
sat
down
at
a
rough
little
leaned
her
elbows
on
it
sipped
the
rest
of
the
stuff
in
her
tumbler
through
a
straw
and
in
the
shelter
of
her
arms
set
the
straw
in
a
near
the
and
spirited
the
bad
liquor
down
under
the
board
do
give
me
away
she
said
the
colonel
knew
she
got
a
commission
on
the
drinks
and
was
there
to
bring
custom
he
nodded
i
hoped
i
see
you
in
time
she
went
on
hurriedly
in
time
to
warn
you
that
mcginty
was
givin
you
a
song
and
dance
hey
tellin
you
a
ghost
story
you
mean
ca
you
understand
plain
english
she
said
irritated
at
such
obtuseness
i
got
worried
thinkin
it
over
for
it
was
me
told
that
pardner
o
yours
she
smiled
wickedly
i
expected
mcginty
have
some
fun
with
the
young
feller
but
i
did
expect
you
be
such
a
hatter
she
wound
up
with
the
popular
reference
to
lunacy
the
colonel
pulled
up
his
great
figure
with
some
pomposity
i
understand
any
feller
can
see
that
you
just
the
kind
the
mcgintys
are
for
she
looked
round
to
see
that
nobody
was
within
earshot
been
layin
round
all
winter
waitin
for
the
spring
crop
o
suckers
if
you
mean
there
is
gold
out
at
mcginty
gulch
you
wrong
i
seen
it
course
you
have
he
paused
she
sweeping
the
gold
nugget
with
vigilant
eye
went
on
in
a
voice
of
indulgent
contempt
some
of
load
up
an
old
with
a
little
charge
o
powder
and
a
quarter
of
an
ounce
of
on
top
fire
that
into
the
prospect
hole
a
dozen
times
or
so
and
then
take
a
sucker
out
to
pan
the
stuff
but
i
bet
si
did
take
any
more
trouble
with
you
than
to
have
some
colours
in
his
mouth
to
spit
in
the
shovel
or
the
pan
when
you
lookin
just
enough
to
drive
you
crazy
and
get
you
to
boost
him
into
a
recordership
why
he
cleaned
up
a
tub
o
money
in
fees
since
you
struck
the
town
the
colonel
moved
uneasily
but
faith
with
him
died
hard
mcginty
strikes
me
as
a
very
decent
sort
of
man
with
a
knowledge
of
practical
mining
and
of
mining
law
maudie
made
a
low
sound
of
impatience
and
pushed
her
empty
glass
aside
oh
very
well
go
your
own
way
waste
the
whole
spring
doin
assessment
for
him
and
when
the
bottom
drops
out
o
recordin
see
si
gettin
some
cheechalko
to
buy
an
interest
in
that
rottin
hole
o
his
her
jaw
fell
as
she
saw
the
colonel
expression
he
got
you
too
she
exclaimed
well
did
you
say
yourself
that
night
you
be
glad
if
let
you
a
lay
pshaw
i
was
only
givin
you
a
song
and
dance
not
you
neither
but
that
pardner
o
yours
i
thought
i
learn
that
young
man
a
lesson
but
i
did
know
you
get
out
o
your
boots
thought
you
looked
like
you
got
some
sense
unmoved
by
the
colonel
aspect
of
offended
dignity
faintly
dashed
with
doubt
she
hurried
on
before
you
go
shellin
out
any
more
cash
or
haulin
stuff
to
glory
hallelujah
just
you
go
down
that
prospect
hole
o
mcginty
when
mcginty
ai
there
and
see
how
many
colours
you
can
ketch
the
colonel
looked
at
her
well
i
do
it
he
said
slowly
and
if
you
right
oh
i
all
right
she
laughed
an
i
know
my
mcginty
backwards
but
she
frowned
with
sudden
anger
it
ai
maudie
pretty
way
to
interfere
with
cheechalkos
gettin
fooled
i
ai
proud
o
the
trouble
i
taken
and
i
thank
you
not
to
mention
it
not
to
that
pardner
o
yours
not
to
nobody
she
stuck
her
nose
in
the
air
and
waved
her
hand
to
french
charlie
who
had
just
then
opened
the
door
and
put
his
head
in
he
came
straight
over
to
her
and
she
made
room
for
him
on
the
bench
the
colonel
went
out
full
of
thought
he
listened
attentively
when
the
that
evening
at
keith
said
something
about
the
woman
up
at
the
gold
nugget
maudie
what
the
rest
of
her
name
do
believe
anybody
knows
oh
yes
they
must
too
it
be
on
her
deeds
she
got
the
best
hundred
by
fifty
foot
lot
in
the
place
held
it
down
last
fall
herself
with
a
and
she
owns
that
cabin
on
the
corner
is
a
better
business
head
in
min√≥ok
than
maudie
she
got
a
lay
on
a
good
property
o
salaman
last
fall
and
i
guess
she
got
more
ready
dust
even
now
before
the
washin
begins
than
anybody
here
except
salaman
and
the
there
ai
a
man
in
min√≥ok
who
would
listen
respectfully
to
maudie
views
on
any
business
proposition
once
he
was
sure
she
was
fooling
and
keith
told
a
string
of
stories
to
show
how
the
min√≥ok
miners
admired
her
astuteness
and
helped
her
unblushingly
to
get
the
better
of
one
another
the
colonel
stayed
in
min√≥ok
till
the
recording
was
all
done
and
mcginty
got
tired
of
living
on
at
the
gulch
the
night
mcginty
arrived
in
town
the
colonel
not
even
taking
the
boy
into
his
confidence
hitched
up
and
departed
for
the
new
district
he
came
back
the
next
day
a
sadder
and
a
wiser
man
they
had
been
sold
mcginty
was
quick
to
gather
that
someone
must
have
given
him
away
it
had
only
been
a
question
of
time
after
all
he
had
lined
his
pockets
and
could
take
the
new
turn
in
his
affairs
with
equanimity
wait
till
the
steamers
begin
to
run
maudie
said
mcginty
play
that
game
with
every
new
oh
mcginty
make
another
fortune
then
he
go
to
dawson
and
blow
it
in
well
colonel
sorry
you
ai
cultivatin
rheumatism
in
a
damp
hole
up
at
glory
hallelujah
i
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
saving
me
from
she
cut
him
short
you
see
you
got
time
now
to
look
about
you
for
something
really
good
if
there
anything
outside
of
little
min√≥ok
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
no
it
was
she
said
shortly
the
colonel
took
out
a
roll
of
bank
bills
and
selected
one
folded
it
small
and
passed
it
towards
her
under
the
ledge
of
the
table
she
glanced
down
oh
i
do
want
that
yes
please
tell
you
i
do
you
done
me
a
very
good
turn
saved
me
a
lot
of
time
and
expense
slowly
she
took
the
money
as
one
thinking
out
something
where
do
you
come
from
he
asked
suddenly
i
was
in
the
chorus
at
the
alcazar
what
made
you
go
into
the
chorus
got
tired
o
life
on
a
all
work
and
no
play
never
saw
a
soul
seen
plenty
since
got
any
people
belonging
to
you
got
a
kind
of
a
husband
a
kind
of
a
husband
yes
the
kind
you
give
away
with
a
pound
o
tea
the
little
face
full
of
humourous
contempt
and
shrewd
scorn
sobered
she
flung
a
black
look
round
the
saloon
and
her
eyes
came
back
to
the
colonel
face
i
got
a
girl
she
said
and
a
sudden
light
flashed
across
her
frowning
as
swiftly
as
a
meteor
cuts
down
along
a
darkened
sky
four
years
old
in
june
ai
goin
into
no
chorus
bet
your
life
going
to
have
money
and
scads
o
things
i
ai
never
had
that
night
the
colonel
and
the
boy
agreed
that
although
they
had
wasted
some
valuable
time
and
five
hundred
and
dollars
on
mcginty
they
still
had
a
chance
of
making
their
fortunes
before
the
spring
rush
the
next
day
they
went
eight
miles
out
in
slush
and
in
alternate
rain
and
sunshine
to
little
min√≥ok
creek
where
the
biggest
paying
claims
were
universally
agreed
to
be
they
found
a
place
even
more
ragged
and
desolate
than
mcginty
where
smoke
was
rising
sullenly
from
underground
fires
and
the
smell
of
burning
wood
filled
the
air
the
ground
turned
up
and
dotted
at
intervals
with
piles
of
frozen
gravel
that
had
been
hoisted
from
the
shafts
by
windlass
forlorn
little
cabins
and
tents
scattered
indiscriminately
a
vast
number
of
empty
bottles
and
cans
sown
broadcast
and
early
as
it
was
a
line
of
sluices
upon
salaman
claim
they
had
heard
a
great
deal
about
the
dark
young
oregon
lawyer
for
salaman
was
the
most
envied
man
in
min√≥ok
come
over
to
my
dump
and
get
some
nuggets
says
salaman
as
in
other
parts
of
the
world
a
man
will
say
come
into
the
and
have
a
cigar
the
snow
was
melted
from
the
top
of
salaman
dump
and
his
guests
had
no
difficulty
in
picking
several
rough
little
bits
of
gold
out
of
the
thawing
gravel
it
was
an
exhilarating
occupation
come
down
my
shaft
and
see
my
and
they
followed
him
he
pointed
out
how
the
frozen
gravel
made
solid
wall
or
pillar
and
no
curbing
was
necessary
with
the
aid
of
a
candle
and
their
urging
they
picked
out
several
dollars
worth
of
coarse
gold
from
the
gravel
in
place
at
the
edge
of
the
when
he
had
got
his
guests
thoroughly
warmed
up
yes
i
took
out
several
thousand
last
fall
and
i
have
twenty
thousand
more
out
of
my
first
summer
and
after
that
after
that
i
going
home
i
would
stay
here
and
work
this
way
and
live
this
way
another
winter
not
for
twenty
millions
i
surprised
to
hear
talking
like
that
sah
well
you
wo
be
once
you
have
tried
it
yourself
mining
up
an
awful
gamble
colours
pretty
well
everywhere
and
a
few
flakes
of
flour
gold
just
enough
to
send
the
average
cheechalko
crazy
but
no
real
outside
of
this
little
gulch
and
even
here
every
inch
has
been
scrambled
for
and
staked
too
and
lots
of
it
fought
over
men
died
here
in
the
fall
defending
their
ground
from
the
jumpers
ground
that
had
a
dollar
in
it
well
your
ground
was
worth
looking
after
and
john
dillon
which
is
his
claim
salaman
led
the
way
over
the
heaps
of
gravel
and
round
a
windlass
to
no
admitting
oh
yes
dillon
and
i
and
a
few
others
have
come
out
of
it
all
right
but
lord
it
a
gamble
dillon
pardner
kennedy
did
the
honours
showing
the
big
chimney
men
the
very
shaft
out
of
which
their
christmas
heap
of
gold
had
been
hoisted
it
was
true
after
all
for
the
favoured
there
plenty
gold
plenty
o
gold
but
said
salaman
there
are
few
things
more
mysterious
than
its
whereabouts
or
why
it
should
be
where
it
is
do
talk
to
me
about
mining
experts
we
had
here
but
who
can
explain
the
mystery
of
min√≥ok
there
are
six
claims
in
all
this
country
that
pay
to
work
the
pay
begins
in
no
before
that
nothing
just
up
yonder
above
no
the
pinches
out
no
mortal
knows
why
a
whole
toiling
and
moiling
and
thousands
of
dollars
put
into
the
ground
have
produced
an
ounce
of
gold
above
that
claim
or
below
no

tell
you
it
an
awful
gamble

you

the
whole

and
all

for
a
radius
of

just
because
there
gold
here
where
we
standing
you
do
mean
there
left
nothing
within
forty
miles
that
somebody
has
either
staked
or
made
money
by
abandoning
made
money
salaman
laughed
it
money
in
your
pocket
pretty
nearly
every
time
you
do
take
up
a
claim
why
on
hunter
alone
they
spent
twenty
thousand
dollars
this
winter
and
how
much
have
they
taken
out
with
and
thumb
salaman
made
an
o
and
looked
shrewdly
through
it
it
an
awful
gamble
he
repeated
solemnly
it
does
seem
possible
there
left
reiterated
the
boy
incredulous
of
such
evil
luck
oh
i
not
saying
you
may
not
make
something
by
getting
on
some
other
fellow
property
if
you
a
mind
to
pay
for
it
but
you
better
not
take
anything
on
trust
i
would
trust
my
own
mother
in
alaska
something
in
the
air
here
that
breeds
lies
you
ca
believe
anybody
yourself
included
he
laughed
stooped
and
picked
a
little
nugget
out
of
the
dump
you
have
the
same
man
tell
you
an
entirely
different
story
about
the
same
matter
within
an
hour
exaggeration
is
in
the
air
the
best
man
becomes
infected
you
lie
he
lies
they
all
lie
lots
of
people
go
crazy
in
alaska
every
year
various
causes
but
it
chiefly
from
believing
their
own
lies
they
returned
to
rampart
it
was
decidedly
inconvenient
considering
the
state
of
their
finances
to
have
thrown
away
that
five
hundred
dollars
on
mcginty
they
messed
with
keith
and
paid
their
of
the
household
expenses
but
dawson
prices
reigned
and
it
was
plain
there
were
no
dawson
prizes
well
said
the
colonel
in
the
morning
we
got
to
live
somehow
till
the
ice
goes
out
the
boy
sat
thinking
the
colonel
went
on
and
we
ca
go
to
dawson
cleaned
out
no
tellin
whether
there
are
any
proper
banks
there
or
whether
my
louisville
instructions
got
through
of
course
we
got
the
dogs
yet
do
care
how
soon
we
sell
red
and
spot
after
breakfast
the
boy
tied
nig
up
securely
behind
keith
shack
and
followed
the
colonel
about
with
a
harassed
and
watchful
air
no
market
for
dogs
now
seemed
to
be
the
general
opinion
and
one
person
bore
up
well
under
the
news
but
the
next
day
a
man
very
splashed
and
muddy
and
obviously
just
in
from
the
gulches
stopped
in
going
by
keith
and
looked
at
nig
dog
market
down
quoted
the
boy
internally
to
hearten
himself
that
mahlemeut
for
sale
observed
the
colonel
to
the
stranger
these
are
the
boy
hastily
dragged
red
and
spot
upon
the
scene
how
much
dollars
apiece
the
man
laughed
ai
you
heard
the
dog
season
over
well
do
you
count
on
livin
to
the
next
the
man
pushed
his
slouch
over
his
eyes
and
scratched
the
back
of
his
head
unless
i
can
git
reasonable
dogs
ai
worth
feedin
till
next
winter
i
suppose
not
said
the
boy
sympathetically
and
you
ca
get

i
at

the

stared

for

black
brute
over
there

dollars
for
nig
and
not
a
cent
more
dogs
is
down
he
could
get
a
dozen
as
good
for
dollars
just
you
try
but
the
colonel
grumbling
said
thirty
dollars
was
thirty
dollars
and
he
reckoned
he
call
it
a
deal
the
boy
stared
opened
his
mouth
to
protest
and
shut
it
without
a
sound
the
colonel
had
untied
nig
and
the
leader
unmindful
of
the
impending
change
in
his
fortunes
dashed
past
the
muddy
man
from
the
gulch
with
such
impetuosity
that
he
knocked
that
gentleman
off
his
legs
he
picked
himself
up
scowling
and
was
feeling
for
his
gold
sack
got
scales
here
no
need
of
scales
the
boy
whipped
out
a
little
roll
of
money
counted
out
thirty
dollars
and
held
it
towards
the
colonel
i
can
afford
to
keep
nig
awhile
if
that
his
figure
the
stranger
was
very
angry
at
this
new
turn
in
the
dog
deal
he
had
seen
that
siwash
out
at
the
gulch
heard
he
was
for
sale
and
came
in
a
purpose
to
git
him
the
dog
season

said
the
boy
pulling
nig
ears
and
smiling
oh

me
down
he
advanced
threateningly
an
if
you
ai
trouble
the
big
colonel
stepped
in
and
tried
to
soothe
the
stranger
as
well
as
to
convince
him
that
this
was
not
the
party
to
try
bullying
on
i
give
you
forty
dollars
for
the
dog
said
the
muddy
man
sulkily
to
the
boy

my
last
word
i
ai

cursed
and
offered

splashed
about

no

and
we
not

they

twenty

in

no

seated
herself
with
satisfaction
on

impudently
as
much
as
to
say
when

i
tell
you
something
the

had
not
the

intention
of
removing
the

grudgingly
he
admitted
to
himself
that
away
from
the
unsavory
atmosphere
of
the

there
was
nothing
in
maudie
positively
offensive
at
this
moment
with
her
shrewd
little
face
peering
pertly
out
from
her
she
looked
more
than
ever
like
an
audacious
child

like
some
strange
new
little
arctic
animal
with
a
whimsical
human
air
look
here
colonel
she
said
presently
either
despairing
of
getting
rid
of
the
boy
or
ceasing
to
care
about
it
you
got
to
get
a
wiggle
on
what
for
she
looked
round
first
over
one
shoulder
then
over
the
other
well
it
on
the
quiet
the
kentuckian
nodded
but
she
winked
her
blue
eyes
suspiciously
at
the
boy
oh
all
right
well
you
been
down
to
little
min√≥ok
ai
you
yes
and
you
seen
how
the
pay
pinches
out
above
no
yes
well
now
if
it
ai
above
no
where
is
it
no
answer
where
does
it
she
repeated
severely
like
a
schoolmarm
to
a
class
of
backward
boys
that
what
everybody
like
to
know
then
let
ask
pitcairn
what
pitcairn
say
she
got
up
briskly
moved
to
another
log
almost
at
the
colonel
feet
and
sat
looking
at
him
a
moment
as
if
making
up
her
mind
about
something
serious
the
colonel
stood
fists
at
his
sides
arrested
by
that
name
pitcairn
you
know
pitcairn
the
best
man
we
got
here
she
asserted
rather
than
asked
the
colonel
nodded
he
an
idaho
miner
pitcairn
is
i
know
well
he
been
out
lookin
at
the
place
where
the
gold
gives
out
on
little
min√≥ok
there
a
pup
just
there
above
no
remember
perfectly
and
above
the
pup
on
the
right
there
a
bed
of
gravel
could
see
much
of
that
for
the
snow
well
sir
that
bed
o
gravel
an
old
channel
no
she
nodded
pitcairn
sunk
a
prospect
and
found
colours
in
his
first
pan
oh
colours
but
the
deeper
he
went
the
better
prospects
he
got
she
stood
up
now
close
to
the
colonel
the
boy
stopped
work
and
leaned
on
the
wood
pile
listening
pitcairn
told
charlie
and
me
on
the
strict
that
the
gold
channel
crossed
the
divide
at
no
and
the
only
gold
on
little
min√≥okust
what
spilt
down
on
those
six
claims
as
the
gold
went
crossin
the
gulch
the
real
placer
is
that
old
channel
above
the
pup
and
boys
in
her
enthusiasm
she
even
included
the
objectionable
pardner
boys
it
rich
as
blazes
i
wonder
drawled
the
colonel
recovering
a
little
from
his
first
thrill
i
would
advise
you
to
waste
much
time
wonderin
she
said
with
fire
what
i
tellin
you
is
scientific
pitcairn
is
straight
as
a
string
you
wo
get
any
hymns
out
o
pitcairn
but
you
get
fair
and
square
his
news
is
worth
a
lot
if
you
got
any
natchral
gumption
anywhere
about
you
you
can
have
a
claim
worth
anything
from
ten
to
fifty
thousand
dollars
this
time
well
well
good
lord
hey
boy
what
we
goin
to
do
well
you
do
want
to
get
excited
admonished
the
queer
little
arctic
animal
jumping
up
suddenly
but
you
can
bunk
early
and
get
a
four
wiggle
on
charlie
and
me
meet
you
on
the
min√≥okl
tad
she
whisked
away
as
suddenly
as
a
chipmunk
they
could
sleep
some
minutes
before
the
time
named
they
were
quietly
leaving
keith
shack
out
on
the
trail
there
were
two
or
three
men
already
disappearing
towards
little
min√≥ok
here
was
maudie
all
by
herself
sprinting
along
like
a
good
fellow
on
the
thin
surface
of
the
last
night
frost
she
walked
in
native
but
her
stuck
out
above
the
small
pack
neatly
lashed
on
her
straight
little
shoulders
they
waited
for
her
she
came
up
very
brisk
and
businesslike
to
their
she
only
nodded
in
a
funny
preoccupied
way
never
opening
her
lips
charlie
gone
on
inquired
the
colonel
presently
she
shook
her
head
knocked
out
been
fightin
no
ran
a
race
to
hunter
to
jump
that
claim
she
nodded
did
he
beat
she
laughed
butts
had
the
start
they
got
there
together
at
nine
three
hours
before
jumpin
time
again
she
nodded
and
found
four
more
waitin
on
the
same
fool
errand
what
did
they
do
called
a
meetin
could
agree
it
looked
like
there
be
a
fight
and
a
fast
race
to
the
recorder
among
the
survivors
but
before
the
meetin
was
adjourned
those
four
that
had
got
there
first
they
were
pretty
gay
they
opened
some
hootch
so
butts
and
charlie
knew
they
nothing
to
fear
except
from
one
another
on
the
top
of
the
divide
that
gave
them
their
last
glimpse
of
rampart
she
stopped
an
instant
and
looked
back
the
quick
flash
of
anxiety
deepening
to
defiance
made
the
others
turn
the
bit
they
could
see
of
the
thoroughfare
was
alive
the
inhabitants
were
rushing
about
like
a
swarm
of
agitated
ants
what
happening
it
got
out
she
exploded
indignantly
they
comin
too
she
turned
flew
down
the
steep
incline
and
then
settled
into
a
steady
determined
gait
that
made
her
gain
on
the
men
who
had
got
so
long
a
start
her
late
companions
stood
looking
back
in
sheer
amazement
for
the
town
end
of
the
trail
was
black
with
figures
the
boy
began
to
laugh
look
if
there
is
old
jansen
and
his
squaw
wife
the
rheumatic
cripple
huddled
on
a
sled
was
drawn
by
a
native
man
and
pushed
by
a
native
woman
they
could
hear
him
swearing
at
both
impartially
in
broken
english
and
chinook
the
colonel
and
the
boy
hurried
after
maudie
it
was
some
minutes
before
they
caught
up
the
boy
feeling
that
he
could
be
in
the
very
act
of
profiting
by
her
acquaintance
began
to
tell
her
about
the
crippled
but
undaunted
swede
she
made
no
answer
just
trotted
steadily
on
the
boy
hazarded
another
remark
an
opinion
that
she
was
making
uncommon
good
time
for
a
woman
you
want
all
the
wind
you
got
before
you
get
back
she
said
shortly
and
silence
fell
on
the
stampeders
some
of
the
young
men
behind
were
catching
up
maudie
set
her
mouth
very
firm
and
quickened
her
pace
this
spectacle
touched
up
those
that
followed
they
broke
into
a
canter
floundered
in
a
drift
recovered
and
passed
on
maudie
pulled
up
that
all
right
let
get
good
and
tired
we
got
to
save
all
the
run
we
got
in
us
for
the
last
lap
the
sun
was
hotter
the
surface
less
good
she
loosened
her
released
her
and
put
them
on
as
she
tightened
her
little
pack
the
came
puffing
up
with
apoplectic
face
why
she
can
throw
the
diamond
hitch
he
gasped
with
admiration
you
thought
the
squaw
hitch
would
be
good
enough
for
me
well
it
is
for
me
he
laughed
breathlessly
that
you
an
and
steadily
she
tramped
along
in
twenty
minutes
maudie
party
came
upon
those
same
young
men
who
had
passed
running
they
sat
in
a
row
on
a
fallen
spruce
one
had
no
rubber
boots
the
other
had
come
off
in
such
a
hurry
he
had
forgotten
his
already
they
were
wet
to
the
waist
step
out
maudie
said
one
with
hilarity
we
be
treadin
on
your
heels
in
a
minute
but
they
were
badly
blown
maudie
wasted
not
a
syllable
her
mouth
began
to
look
drawn
there
were
violet
shadows
under
the
eyes
the
colonel
glanced
at
her
now
and
then
is
she
thinking
about
that
is
maudie
stampedin
through
the
snow
so
that
other
little
woman
need
never
dance
at
the
alcazar
no
the
colonel
knew
well
enough
that
maudie
rather
liked
this
stampedin
business
she
had
passed
one
of
those
men
who
had
got
the
long
start
of
her
he
carried
a
pack
once
in
a
while
she
would
turn
her
face
over
her
shoulder
glancing
back
with
the
frank
eyes
of
an
enemy
at
her
labouring
along
the
trail
come
on
colonel
she
commanded
with
a
new
sharpness
keep
up
your
lick
but
the
colonel
had
had
about
enough
of
this
gait
from
now
on
he
fell
more
and
more
behind
but
the
boy
was
with
her
neck
and
neck
guess
you
goin
to
get
there
guess
i
am
some
men
behind
them
began
to
run
they
passed
they
had
pulled
off
their
parkis
and
left
them
where
they
fell
they
threw
off
their
caps
now
and
the
sweat
rolled
down
their
faces
not
a
countenance
but
wore
that
immobile
look
the
fixed
unseeing
eye
of
the
spent
runner
who
is
overtaxing
heart
and
lungs
not
only
maudie
now
but
everyone
was
silent
occasionally
a
man
would
rouse
himself
out
of
a
walk
as
if
out
of
sleep
and
run
a
few
yards
going
the
more
weakly
after
several
of
the
men
who
had
been
behind
caught
up
where
was
kentucky
if
maudie
wondered
she
wasted
no
time
over
the
speculation
for
his
own
good
she
had
admonished
him
to
keep
up
his
lick
but
of
course
the
main
thing
was
that
maudie
should
keep
up
hers
what
if
this
is
the
great
day
of
my
life
thought
the
boy
shall
i
always
look
back
to
this
why
it
sunday
wonder
if
kentucky
remembers
never
pausing
the
boy
glanced
back
vaguely
amused
and
saw
the
colonel
plunging
heavily
along
in
front
of
half
a
dozen
who
were
obviously
out
of
condition
for
such
an
expedition
eyes
bloodshot
lumbering
on
with
nervous
whisky
gait
now
whipped
into
a
breathless
gallop
now
half
falling
by
the
way
another
of
the
gold
nugget
women
with
two
men
and
somewhere
down
the
trail
the
crippled
swede
swearing
at
his
squaw
a
dreamy
feeling
came
over
the
boy
where
in
the
gold
basins
of
the
north
was
this
kind
of
thing
not
happening
finished
yesterday
or
planned
for
yes
it
was
typical
between
patches
of
ragged
black
spruce
wide
stretches
of
moss
under
a
lowering
sky
and
a
mob
of
men
floundering
through
the
drifts
to
find
a
fortune
see
how
they
run
mad
mice
they
been
going
on
stampedes
all
winter
and
would
go
year
in
year
out
until
they
died
the
prizes
were
not
for
such
as
they
as
for
himself
ah
it
was
a
great
day
for
him
he
was
going
at
last
to
claim
that
he
had
come
so
far
to
find
this
was
the
decisive
moment
of
his
life
at
the
thought
he
straightened
up
and
passed
maudie
she
gave
him
a
single
sidelong
look
unfriendly
even
fierce
that
was
because
he
could
run
like
sixty
and
keep
it
up
when
i
a
millionaire
i
shall
always
remember
that
i
rich
because
i
won
the
race
a
dizzy
feeling
came
over
him
he
seemed
to
be
running
through
some
softly
resisting
medium
like
water
no
like
wine
jelly
his
heart
was
pounding
up
in
his
throat
what
if
something
wrong
and
i
drop
dead
on
the
way
to
my
mine
well
kentucky
look
after
things
maudie
had
caught
up
again
and
here
was
little
min√≥ok
at
last
a
couple
of
men
who
from
the
beginning
had
been
well
in
advance
of
everyone
else
and
often
out
of
sight
had
seemed
for
the
last
five
minutes
to
be
losing
ground
but
now
they
put
on
steam
maudie
too
she
stepped
out
of
her
snowshoes
and
flung
them
up
on
the
low
roof
of
the
first
cabin
then
she
ducked
her
head
crooked
her
arms
at
the
elbow
and
with
fists
uplifted
she
broke
into
a
run
jumping
from
pile
to
pile
of
frozen
pay
gliding
under
scrambling
up
the
bank
slipping
on
the
rotting
ice
recovering
dashing
on
over
fallen
timber
and
through
drifts
on
beyond
no
up
to
the
bench
above
when
the
boy
got
to
pitcairn
prospect
hole
there
were
already
six
claims
gone
he
proceeded
to
stake
the
seventh
next
to
maudie
that
person
with
flaming
cheeks
was
driving
her
last
into
a
with
a
piece
of
obsidian
the
colonel
came
along
in
time
to
stake
no
below
under
personal
supervision
not
much
use
in
her
opinion
except
that
with
gold
it
where
you
find
it
and
that
all
any
man
can
tell
you
as
she
was
returning
alone
to
her
own
claim
behold
two
brawny
circle
city
miners
pulling
out
her
stakes
and
putting
in
their
own
she
flew
at
them
with
remarks
unprintable
you
keep
your
head
shut
advised
one
of
the
men
a
big
fellow
this
was
our
claim
first
we
was
here
with
pitcairn
yesterday
somebody
took
away
our
you
take
me
for
a
cheechalko
she
screamed
and
her
blue
eyes
flashed
like
smitten
steel
she
pulled
up
her
sweater
and
felt
in
her
belt
you
take
your
stakes
out
put
mine
back
unless
you
want
a
revolver
gleamed
in
her
hand
hold
on
said
the
spokesman
hurriedly
ca
you
take
a
joke
no
this
ai
my
day
for
jokin
you
want
to
put
them
stakes
o
mine
back
she
stood
on
guard
till
it
was
done
and
now
i
advise
you
like
a
mother
to
home
you
find
this
climate
very
to
your
health
they
went
farther
up
the
slope
and
marked
out
a
claim
on
the
incline
above
the
bench
in
a
few
hours
the
was
staked
to
the
very
top
and
still
the
stream
of
people
struggled
out
from
rampart
to
the
scene
of
the
new
strike
all
day
long
and
all
the
night
the
trail
was
alive
with
the
coming
or
the
going
of
the
five
hundred
and
odd
souls
that
made
up
the
population
in
the
town
itself
the
excitement
grew
rather
than
waned
men
talked
themselves
into
a
fever
others
took
fire
and
the
epidemic
spread
like
some
obscure
nervous
disease
nobody
slept
everybody
drank
and
hurrahed
and
said
it
was
the
greatest
night
in
the
history
of
min√≥ok
in
the
gold
nugget
saloon
crowded
to
suffocation
pitcairn
organized
the
new
mining
district
and
named
it
the
idaho
bar
french
charlie
and
keith
had
gone
out
late
in
the
day
on
their
return
keith
sold
his
stake
to
a
woman
for
dollars
and
charlie
advertised
a
in
his
for
five
thousand
between
these
two
extremes
you
could
hear
idaho
bar
quoted
at
any
figure
you
liked
maudie
was
in
towering
spirits
she
drank
several
cocktails
and
in
her
stampedin
skirt
and
her
scarlet
sweater
she
danced
the
most
audacious
jig
even
maudie
had
ever
presented
to
the
gold
nugget
patrons
the
miners
yelled
with
delight
one
of
them
caught
her
up
and
put
her
on
the
counter
of
the
bar
where
no
whit
at
a
loss
she
curveted
and
spun
among
the
bottles
and
the
glasses
as
lightly
as
a
dragonfly
dips
and
whirls
along
a
summer
brook
the
enthusiasm
grew
delirious
the
men
began
to
throw
nuggets
at
her
and
maudie
never
pausing
in
the
dance
caught
them
on
the
fly
suddenly
she
saw
the
big
chap
turn
away
and
with
his
back
to
her
pretend
to
read
the
notice
on
the
wall
written
in
charcoal
on
a
great
sheet
of
brown
min√≥ok
april
to
who
it
may
concern
know
all
men
by
these
presents
that
i
james
mcginty
now
of
min√≥ok
or
rampart
city
alaska
do
hereby
give
notice
of
my
intention
to
hold
and
claim
a
lien
by
virtue
of
the
statue
in
such
case
he
had
read
so
far
when
maudie
having
jumped
down
off
the
bar
with
her
fists
full
of
nuggets
and
dodging
her
admirers
wormed
her
way
to
the
colonel
she
thrust
her
small
person
in
between
the
notice
and
the
reader
and
scrutinised
the
tanned
face
on
which
the
rochester
burners
shed
a
flood
of
light
you
lookin
mighty
serious
she
said
am
i
thinkin
home
sweet
home
not
just
then
say
i
told
you
a
me
you
ai
never
told
me
nothin
he
seemed
not
to
know
the
answer
to
that
and
pulled
at
his
ragged
beard
she
leaned
back
against
mcginty
notice
and
blurred
still
more
the
smudged
intention
by
virtue
of
the
statue
married
o
course
she
said
no
widder
no
never
hitched
up
yet
he
shook
his
head
never
goin
to
i
oh
i
do
know
he
laughed
and
turned
his
head
over
his
shoulder
to
the
curious
scene
between
them
and
the
bar
it
was
suddenly
as
if
he
had
never
seen
it
before
then
while
maudie
waited
a
little
scornful
a
little
kind
his
eyes
went
through
the
window
to
the
pink
and
orange
sunrise
as
some
change
came
over
the
colonel
face
she
died
said
maudie
no
no
she
did
die
then
half
to
himself
half
to
forestall
maudie
crude
probing
but
i
lost
her
he
finished
oh
you
lost
her
he
stood
looking
past
the
ugliness
within
to
the
morning
majesty
without
but
it
was
not
either
that
he
saw
maudie
studied
him
guess
you
ai
give
up
expectin
to
find
her
some
day
no
no
not
quite
humph
did
you
guess
you
find
her
here
no
and
his
absent
smile
seemed
to
remove
him
leagues
away
no
not
here
i
could
a
told
you
she
began
savagely
i
do
know
for
certain
whether
any
what
you
call
good
women
come
up
here
but
i
dead
sure
none
stay
when
do
you
leave
for
home
maudie
he
said
gently
but
at
the
flattering
implication
the
oddest
thing
happened
as
she
stood
there
with
her
fists
full
of
gold
maudie
eyes
filled
she
turned
abruptly
and
went
out
the
crowd
began
to
melt
away
in
half
an
hour
only
those
remained
who
had
more
hootch
than
they
could
carry
off
the
premises
they
made
themselves
comfortable
on
the
floor
near
the
stove
and
the
greatest
night
min√≥ok
had
known
was
ended
chapter
xviii
a
miners
meeting
leiden
oder
triumphiren
hammer
oder

goethe
in
a
cabin
owned
by
bonsor
down
near
the
judge
corey
was
administering
miners
law
the
chief
magistrate
was
already
a
familiar
figure
standing
on
his
dump
at
little
min√≥ok
speculatively
chewing
and
discussing
glayshal
action
but
most
of
the
time
at
the
gold
nugget
chewing
still
and
discussing
more
guardedly
the
action
some
min√≥ok
man
was
threatening
to
bring
against
another
you
may
treat
a
glacier
cavalierly
but
miners
law
is
a
serious
matter
corey
was
sitting
before
a
deal
table
littered
with
papers
strewn
round
a
central
bottle
of
ink
in
which
a
steel
pen
stuck
upright
the
judge
wore
his
usual
dilapidated
business
suit
of
brown
cheviot
that
had
once
been
and
was
now
a
streaky
drab
on
his
feet
stretched
out
under
the
magisterial
table
till
they
joined
the
jury
a
pair
of
moccasins
on
his
grizzled
head
a
cowboy
hat
set
well
back
he
could
spit
farther
than
any
man
in
min√≥ok
and
by
the
same
token
was
a
better
shot
they
had
unanimously
elected
him
judge
the
had
taken
possession
of
the
chairs
and
wooden
stools
round
the
stove
all
the
later
arrivals
including
keith
and
his
friends
sat
on
the
floor
there
a
good
many
here
they
keep
comin
as
long
as
a
lean
man
can
scrouge
in
yes
said
keith
everybody
got
to
come
even
if
it
only
the
usual
row
between
pardners
who
want
to
part
and
ca
agree
about
dividing
the
outfit
got
to
come
keith
laughed
that
the
way
everybody
feels
there
be
a
debate
and
a
chance
to
cast
a
vote
is
your
american
always
itching
to
hold
a
meeting
about
something
do
know
about
that
said
mcginty
but
i
do
know
there
more
things
happens
in
a
minute
to
make
a
man
mad
in
alaska
than
happens
in
a
year
anywhere
else
and
his
sentiment
was
loudly
applauded
the
plaintiff
had
scored
a
hit
i
do
know
but
two
partnerships
the
was
saying
of
all
those
on
my
ship
and
on
the
muckluck
and
the
may
west
just
two
that
have
stood
the
alaska
strain
everyone
that
did
break
on
the
boats
or
in
camp
went
to
smash
on
the
trail
they
all
admitted
that
the
trail
was
the
final
test
while
they
smoked
and
spat
into
or
at
the
stove
and
told
trail
yarns
the
chief
magistrate
arranged
papers
conferred
with
the
clerk
and
another
man
wrinkled
deeply
his
leathery
forehead
consulted
his
waterbury
and
shot
under
the
table
another
reason
everybody
comes
whispered
keith
is
because
the
side
that
wins
always
takes
the
town
up
to
the
nugget
and
treats
to
hootch
whenever
you
see
eighty
or
ninety
more
drunks
than
usual
you
know
there
either
been
a
stampede
or
else
justice
has
been
administered
ai
bonsor
late
asked
someone
no
it
a
quarter
of
why
do
they
want
bonsor
his
case
on
the
docket
mcginty
burt
bonsor
proprietor
of
the
gold
nugget
if
they
got
a
row
on
if
they
got
a
row
course
they
got
a
row
were
they
pardners
but
mcginty
spends
all
his
time
at
the
gold
nugget
well
where
would
he
spend
it
a
miners
meetin
a
pretty
poor
machine
mcginty
was
saying
to
the
but
it
the
best
we
got
in
a
country
bigger
than
several
of
the
nations
of
europe
put
together
responded
that
gentleman
with
much
public
spirit
a
great
country
right
you
bet
a
country
that
paid
for
its
purchase
over
and
over
again
even
before
we
discovered
gold
here
did
she
good
old
and
the
worst
treated
part
o
the
union
that
so
after
this
when
i
read
about
russian
corruption
and
chinese
cruelty
i
remember
the
way
uncle
sam
treats
the
natives
up
and
us
white
men
that
are
openin
up
this
great
rich
country
fur
uncle
sam
with
no
proper
courts
no
government
protection
no
help
no
justice
no
nothin
yer
forgittin
them
reindeer
and
the
rang
with
derisive
laughter
congress
started
that
there
relief
expedition
all
right
the
josher
went
on
only
them
blamed
reindeer
had
got
the
feed
habit
and
when
they
et
up
everything
in
sight
they
set
down
on
the
dalton
trail
and
there
they
settin
yit
just
like
they
was
congress
but
i
like
to
hear
no
feller
talkin
agin
the
yes
it
all
very
funny
said
mcginty
gloomily
but
think
o
the
fix
a
feller
in
wot
had
a
wrong
done
him
in
the
fall
and
knows
justice
is
thousands
o
miles
away
and
he
ca
even
go
after
her
for
eight
months
and
in
them
eight
months
the
feller
wot
robbed
him
has
et
up
the
money
or
worked
out
the
claim
and
gone
no
sir
we
do
wait
and
we
do
go
we
stay
at
home
and
call
a
meetin
the
door
opened
and
bonsor
and
the
with
great
difficulty
forced
their
way
in
they
stood
flattened
against
the
wall
during
the
diversion
mcginty
was
growling
disdainfully
rubbidge
rubbidge
reckon
it
pretty
serious
rubbidge
did
you
ever
know
a
miners
meetin
to
make
a
decision
that
become
law
with
the
whole
community
ready
to
enforce
it
if
necessary
rubbidge
oh
we
hang
a
man
if
we
do
like
his
looks
grumbled
mcginty
but
he
was
overborne
there
were
a
dozen
ready
to
uphold
the
majesty
of
the
miners
meetin
no
sir
no
funny
business
about
our
law
this
tribunal
final
i
ai
disputin
that
it
final
i
ai
talkin
about
law
i
was
mentionin
justice
the
feller
that
loses
is
always
gassin
justice
when
you
win
you
do
think
there
any
flies
on
the
justice
ai
had
much
experience
with
winnin
we
all
knows
who
wins
in
these
yere
meetin
who
but
they
turned
their
eyes
on
bonsor
over
by
the
door
who
wins
repeated
a
circle
city
man
the
feller
that
got
the
most
friends
it
so
whispered
same
at
circle
returned
the
man
mcginty
looked
at
him
was
this
a
possible
adherent
you
got
a
push
at
circle
he
inquired
but
without
genuine
interest
in
the
civil
administration
up
the
river
why
this
yere
town
was
organised
when
we
had
got
no
court
of
arbitration
to
fix
a
boundary
or
even
to
hang
a
thief
we
had
our
push
just
like
we
was
he
lowered
his
voice
and
leaned
towards
his
circle
friend
with
bonsor
help
they
corey
judge
o
the
court
and
bonsor
ai
never
let
corey
forgit
it

the
matter
mino√≥k
does
mind
arbitrating
says
keith
low
to
the
colonel
but
there
is
a
man
in
camp
that
would
give
five
cents
for
the
interest
of
the
heirs
of
lawrence
in
that
fifteen
hundred
dollars
a
hammering
on
the
clerk
little
table
announced
that
it
was
seven
the
court
then
called
for
the
complaint
filed
by
mcginty
bonsor
the
first
case
on
the
docket
the
clerk
had
just
risen
when
the
door
was
flung
open
and
hatless
coatless
face
aflame
maudie
stood
among
the
miners
boys
said
she
on
the
top
of
a
scream
i
been
robbed
hey

golly
maudie

they
spoke
all
together
everybody
had
jumped
up
while

she
choked
and
her
eyes
filled
boys

dust

dollars
they

where
did
you
have
in
a
little
place
under
in
a
hole
her
face
twitched
and
she
put
her
hand
up
to
hide
it
mean
shame
dirt
mean
we
find
him
maudie
an
when
we
do
we
hang
him
on
the
cottonwood
did
anybody

where

kept
your
i
did
think
so
unless
it
was
no
she
screamed
hysterically
and
then
fell
into
weak
crying
ca
think
who
could
have
been
such
a
skunk
but
who
do
you
suspect
persisted
the
judge
how
do
i
know
she
retorted
angrily
i
suspect
everybody
till
till
i
know
she
clenched
her
hands
that
a
thief
should
be
operating
in
mino√≥k
on
somebody
who
dead
yet
was
a
matter
that
came
home
to
the
business
and
the
bosoms
of
all
the
men
in
the
camp
in
the
midst
of
the
babel
of
speculation
and
excitement
maudie
still
crying
and
talking
incoherently
about
skunks
opened
the
door
the
men
crowded
after
her
nobody
suggested
it
but
the
entire
miners
meeting
with
one
accord
adjourned
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
only
a
portion
could
be
accommodated
under
maudie
roof
but
the
rest
crowded
in
front
of
her
door
or
went
and
examined
the
window
maudie
was
a
cheerful
place
its
one
room
neatly
kept
lined
throughout
with
red
and
white
drill
hung
with
marten
and
fox
carpeted
with
wolf
and
caribou
the
single
sign
of
disorder
was
that
the
bed
was
pulled
out
a
little
from
its
place
in
the
angle
of
the
wall
above
the
patent
condenser
stove
behind
the
where
the
patent
condensation
of
oil
into
gas
went
on
tiers
of
shelves
enamelled
pots
and
pans
ranged
below
dishes
and
glasses
above
on
the
very
top
like
a
frieze
gaily
labelled
ranks
of
tinned
goods
on
the
table
under
the
window
a
pair
of
gold
scales
a
fire
burned
in
the
stove
the
sunlight
poured
through
the
that
she
had
tacked
up
for
a
and
over
this
one
saw
the
and
fur
caps
of
the
outside
crowd
clutching
judge
corey
by
the
arm
maudie
pulled
him
after
her
into
the
narrow
space
behind
the
and
the
wall
it
was
here
see
she
stooped
down
some
of
the
men
pulled
the
bed
farther
out
so
that
they
too
could
pass
round
and
see
this
piece
o
board
goes
down
so
slick
you
never
know
it
lifted
out
she
fitted
it
in
with
shaking
hands
and
then
with
her
nails
and
a
hairpin
got
it
out
and
way
in
underneath
i
had
this
box
i
always
set
it
on
a
flat
stone
she
spoke
as
if
this
oversight
were
the
thief
chief
crime
see
like
that
she
fitted
the
into
unseen
depths
of
space
and
then
brought
it
out
again
wet
and
muddy
the
ground
was
full
of
springs
hereabouts
and
the
thaw
had
loosed
them
boys
she
stood
up
and
held
out
the
box
boys
it
was
full
eloquently
she
turned
it
upside
down
how
much
do
you
reckon
you
had
she
handed
the
muddy
box
to
the
nearest
sympathiser
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
wiped
her
eyes
any
idea
i
weighed
it
all
over
again
after
i
got
in
from
the
gold
nugget
the
night
we
went
on
the
stampede
as
she
sobbed
out
the
list
of
her
former
possessions
judge
corey
took
it
down
on
the
back
of
a
dirty
envelope
so
many
ounces
of
dust
so
many
in
nuggets
so
much
in
bills
and
coin
gold
and
silver
each
item
was
a
stab
yes
all
that
all
that
she
jumped
up
wildly
and
it
gone
but
we
got
to
find
it
what
you
hangin
round
here
for
why
if
you
boys
had
any
natchral
spunk
you
have
the
thief
strung
up
by
now
we
got
to
find
him
fust
you
wo
find
him
standin
here
they
conferred
afresh
it
must
have
been
somebody
who
knowed
where
you
kept
the
stuff
her
red
eyes
wandered
miserably
restlessly
to
the
window
over
the
red
french
charlie
and
butts
looked
in
they
had
not
been
to
the
meeting
maudie
face
darkened
as
she
caught
sight
of
the
canadian
oh
yes
you
can
crow
over
me
now
she
shouted
shrilly
above
the
buzz
of
comment
and
suggestion
the
canadian
led
the
way
round
to
the
door
and
the
two
men
crowded
in
you
just
get
out
maudie
cried
in
a
fury
did
i
turn
you
out
this
and
tell
you
never
hol
on
said
french
charlie
in
a
conciliatory
tone
this
true
your
losin
yes
it
true
but
i
ai
askin
your
sympathy
he
stopped
short
and
frowned
course
not
when
you
can
get
his
under
his
he
glowered
at
the
colonel
maudie
broke
into
a
volley
of
abuse
the
very
air
smelt
of
brimstone
when
finally
through
sheer
exhaustion
she
dropped
on
the
side
of
the
bed
the
devil
prompted
french
charlie
to
respond
in
kind
she
jumped
up
and
turned
suddenly
round
upon
corey
speaking
in
a
voice
quite
different
low
and
hoarse
you
asked
me
judge
if
anybody
knew
where
i
kept
my
stuff
charlie
did
the
canadian
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
lurid
remark
and
stared
stupidly
the
buzz
died
away
the
cabin
was
strangely
still
was
you
along
with
the
rest
up
to
idaho
bar
inquired
the
judge
in
a
friendly
voice
not
when
we
all
were
no
maudie
eyes
were
regaining
a
dangerous
brightness
i
wanted
him
to
come
with
me
he
would
and
we
quarrelled
we
did
you
did
quarrel
put
in
the
judge
we
did
said
maudie
breathless
not
about
that
it
was
because
she
wanted
another
feller
to
come
too
again
he
shot
an
angry
glance
at
the
kentuckian
and
charlie
said
if
i
gave
the
other
feller
the
tip
he
would
come
and
he
get
even
with
me
if
it
took
a
leg
well
it
looks
like
he
done
it
ca
you
prove
an
alibi
thought
you
said
you
was
along
with
the
rest
to
idaho
bar
suggested
windy
jim
so
i
was
i
did
see
you
maudie
flashed
when
were
you
there
asked
the
judge
last
night
oh
yes
when
everybody
else
was
comin
home
you
all
know
if
the
time
charlie
usually
goes
on
a
stampede
you
if
words
could
slay
maudie
would
have
dropped
dead
riddled
with
a
dozen
mortal
wounds
but
she
lived
to
reply
in
kind
abandonment
of
coherent
defence
was
against
him
while
he
wallowed
blindly
in
a
mire
of
offensive
epithet
his
came
to
dark
conclusions
he
had
an
old
score
to
pay
off
against
maudie
they
all
knew
that
had
he
chosen
this
way
what
other
so
effectual
he
might
even
say
most
of
that
dust
was
his
anyway
but
it
was
an
alarming
precedent
the
fire
of
maudie
excitement
had
caught
and
spread
eve
the
less
inflammable
muttered
darkly
that
it
was
all
up
with
mino√≥k
if
a
person
could
go
on
a
stampede
without
havin
his
dust
took
out
of
his
cabin
the
crowd
was
pressing
charlie
and
twenty
were
asked
him
in
a
minute
he
beside
himself
with
rage
or
fear
or
both
lost
all
power
except
to
curse
the
judge
seemed
to
be
taking
down
damning
evidence
on
the
dirty
envelope
some
were
suggesting
bring
him
over
to
the
court
yes
try
him
straight
away
was
heard
above
the
din
saying
it
was
all
gammon
wasting
time
over
a
trial
or
even
in
a
plain
case
like
this
for
the
judge
to
require
the
usual
complaint
made
in
writing
and
signed
by
three
citizens
two
men
laid
hold
of
the
canadian
and
he
turned
ghastly
white
under
his
tan
me
me
tief
you
let
me
alone
he
began
to
struggle
his
terrified
eyes
rolling
round
the
little
cabin
fell
on
butts
i
don
know
but
one
tief
in
min√≥ok
he
said
wildly
like
a
man
wandering
in
a
fever
and
unconscious
of
having
spoken
till
he
noticed
there
was
a
diversion
of
some
sort
people
were
looking
at
butts
a
sudden
inspiration
pierced
the
canadian
fog
of
terror
you
know
what
butts
done
to
jack
mcquestion
you
ai
forgot
how
he
sneaked
jack
watch
the
incident
was
historic
every
eye
on
butts
charlie
caught
up
breath
and
courage
an
night
maudie
treat
me
like
she
done
he
shot
a
blazing
glance
at
the
traitor
i
fixed
it
up
with
butts
got
him
to
go
soft
on
and
nab
ring
you
did
shouted
maudie
with
a
shaking
finger
charlie
pointed
out
jimmie
the
cashier
did
i
tell
you
to
weigh
me
out
twenty
dollars
for
butts
that
night
right
says
jimmie
it
was
to
square
butts
fur
gittin
that
ring
away
from
maudie
you
put
up
a
job
like
that
on
me
to
be
fooled
publicly
was
worse
than
being
robbed
charlie
paid
no
heed
to
her
quivering
wrath
the
menace
of
the
gallows
outrivalled
even
maudie
and
her
moods
why
should
i
pay
butts
twenty
dollars
if
i
could
work
dat
racket
if
i
want
expert
work
i
go
to
a
man
like
butts
who
knows
his
business
i
a
miner
like
the
rest
o
yer
the
centre
of
gravity
had
shifted
it
was
very
grave
indeed
in
the
neighbourhood
of
butts
hold
on
said
the
judge
forcing
his
way
nearer
to
the
man
whose
fingers
had
a
renown
so
perilous
a
man
plays
a
trick
about
a
girl
ring
do
prove
he
stole
her
money
this
thing
happened
while
the
town
was
emptied
out
on
the
little
min√≥ok
trail
did
you
go
off
with
the
rest
yesterday
morning
no
ha
gasped
maudie
as
though
this
were
conclusive
had
business
in
town
did
you
butts
declined
to
answer
you
thought
the
out
on
the
gulch
could
wait
and
the
in
my
cabin
could
you
lie
remarked
butts
what
time
did
you

at
all
where
were
you
here
in
rampart
what

commanded
the
judge
as
the
crowd
rocked
towards
butts
you
tell
us
what
kept
you
at
home
butts
shut
his
mouth
angrily
but
a
glance
at
the
faces
nearest
him
made
him
think
an
answer
prudent
i
was
tired
the
men
many
of
them
ailing
who
had
nearly
killed
themselves
to
get
to
idaho
bar
sneered
openly
i
been
jumpin
a
claim
up
at
hunter
so
had
charlie
but
he
joined
the
new
stampede
in
the
afternoon
well
i
did
why
even
the
old
cripple
jansen
went
on
this
stampede
ca
help
that
butts
you
the
only
white
man
in
the
district
that
stayed
at
home
corey
spoke
in
his
most
judicial
style
butts
must
have
felt
the
full
significance
of
so
suspicious
a
fact
but
all
he
said
was
y
ought
to
fix
up
a
notice
anybody
that
do
join
a
stampede
will
be
held
guilty
o
grand
larceny
saying
this
butts
had
backed
a
step
behind
the
and
with
incredible
quickness
had
pulled
out
a
revolver
but
before
he
had
brought
it
into
range
had
struck
his
arm
down
and
two
or
three
had
sprung
at
the
weapon
and
wrested
it
away
search
him
no
tellin
what
else
he
got
and
he
so
damned
handy
search
him
maudie
pressed
forward
as
the
pinioned
man
pockets
were
turned
out
only
tobacco
a
small
buckskin
bag
with
less
than
four
ounces
of
dust
a
pipe
and
a
knife
likely

carrying
my
stuff
about
on
him
said
she
contemptuous
of
her
own
keen
interest
get
out
a
warrant
to
search
butts
premises
said
a
voice
in
the
crowd
mcginty
and
johnson
are
down
there
now
think
he
leave
anything
layin
round
maudie
pressed
still
closer
to
the
beleaguered
butts
say
if
i
make
the
boys
let
you
go
back
to
circle
will
you
tell
me
where
you
hid
my
money
ai
got
your
money
look
at
whispered
charlie
still
so
terrified
he
could
hardly
stand
butts
ai
borrowin
no
trouble
and
this
formulating
of
the
general
impression
did
butts
no
good
as
they
had
watched
the
calm
demeanour
of
the
man
under
suspicion
of
what
was
worse
in
their
eyes
than
murder
there
had
come
over
the
bystanders
a
wave
of
that
primitive
cruelty
that
to
this
hour
will
wake
in
modern
men
and
cry
as
loud
as
in
judean
days
or
in
the
saga
times
of
iceland
retribution
let
him
suffer
let
him
pay
in
blood
and
here
again
on
the
yukon
that
need
of
visible
atonement
to
right
the
crazy
injustice
of
the
earth
even
the
women
the
others
had
crowded
in
were
eager
for
instant
expiation
of
the
worst
crime
such
a
community
knows
they
told
one
another
excitedly
how
they
realised
all
along
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
before
butts
would
be
tryin
his
game
up
here
nobody
was
safe
luckily
they
were
on
to
him
but
look
he
did
care
a
curse
it
would
be
a
good
night
job
to
make
him
care
three
men
had
hold
of
him
and
everybody
talked
at
once
minnie
bryan
was
sure
she
had
seen
him
skulking
round
maudie
after
that
lady
had
gone
up
the
trail
but
everybody
had
been
too
excited
about
the
stampede
to
notice
particularly
the
judge
and
bonsor
were
shouting
and
gesticulating
butts
answering
bitterly
but
quietly
still
his
face
was
pretty
grim
but
it
looked
as
if
he
were
the
one
person
in
the
place
who
had
lost
his
head
maudie
was
still
crying
at
intervals
and
advertising
to
the
newcomers
that
wealth
she
had
hitherto
kept
so
dark
and
between
whiles
she
stared
fixedly
at
butts
as
conviction
of
his
guilt
deepened
to
a
rage
to
see
him
suffer
for
his
crime
she
would
rather
have
her
nuggets
back
but
failing
that
let
butts
pay
he
owed
her
six
thousand
dollars
let
him
pay
the
miners
were
hustling
him
to
the
door
to
the
court
house
or
to
the
a
which
look
here
cried
out
the
colonel
mcginty
and
johnson
have
got
back
nobody
listened
justice
had
been
sufficiently
served
in
sending
them
they
had
forced
butts
out
across
the
threshold
the
crowd
packed
close
behind
the
only
men
who
had
not
pressed
forward
were
keith
the
colonel
and
the
boy
and
still
standing
by
the
what
are
they
going
to
do
with
him
the
colonel
turned
to
keith
with
horror
in
his
face
keith
eyes
were
on
the
boy
who
had
stooped
and
picked
up
the
block
of
wood
that
had
fitted
over
the
he
was
staring
at
it
with
dilated
eyes
sharply
he
turned
his
head
in
the
direction
where
had
stood
jack
was
just
making
for
the
door
on
the
heels
of
the
last
of
those
pressing
to
get
out
the
boy
low
cry
was
drowned
in
the
din
he
lunged
forward
but
the
colonel
gripped
him
looking
up
he
saw
that
kentucky
understood
and
meant
somehow
to
manage
the
business
quietly
jack
was
trying
now
right
now
left
to
force
his
way
through
the
congestion
at
the
door
like
a
harried
rabbit
at
a
wattled
fence
a
touch
on
the
shoulder
simultaneously
with
the
click
of
a
trigger
at
his
ear
brought
his
face
round
over
his
shoulder
he
made
the
instinctive
pioneer
motion
to
his
hip
looked
into
the
bore
of
the
pistol
and
under
keith
grip
dropped
his
with
a
smothered
oath
or
was
it
that
other
weapon
in
the
colonel
left
that
bleached
the
ruddy
face
simply
the
block
of
wood
on
the
under
side
dried
in
like
a
faint
stain
four
muddy
index
joint
lacking
without
a
word
the
colonel
turned
the
upper
side
out
a
smudge
no
the
grain
of
human
skin
clean
printed
a
distorted
palm
without
a
thumb
only
one
man
in
min√≥ok
could
make
that
sign
manual
the
last
of
the
crowd
were
over
the
threshold
now
and
still
no
word
was
spoken
by
those
who
stayed
behind
till
the
colonel
said
to
the
boy
go
with
and
look
after
butts
give
us
five
minutes
more
if
you
can
he
laid
the
block
on
a
and
keeping
pistol
and
eye
still
on
the
thief
took
his
watch
in
his
left
hand
as
the
boy
shot
through
the
door
butts
was
making
a
good
fight
for
his
life
but
he
was
becoming
exhausted
the
leading
spirits
were
running
him
down
the
bank
to
where
a
crooked
leaned
cautiously
over
the
as
if
to
spy
out
the
river
secret
but
after
arriving
there
they
were
a
little
delayed
for
lack
of
what
they
called
tackle
they
sent
a
man
off
for
it
and
then
sent
another
to
hurry
up
the
man
the
boy
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
crowd
a
little
above
them
watching
maudie
door
and
with
feverish
anxiety
turning
every
few
seconds
to
see
how
it
was
with
butts
up
in
the
cabin
had
pulled
out
of
the
usual
capacious
pockets
of
the
miner
that
fasten
with
a
patent
snap
a
tattered
fat
with
bills
he
plunged
deeper
and
brought
up
pacific
coast
eagles
and
pieces
canadian
and
american
gold
that
went
rolling
out
of
his
maimed
and
nervous
hand
across
the
tablet
to
the
scales
and
set
the
brass
pans
sawing
up
and
down
keith
his
revolver
still
at
full
cock
had
picked
up
a
trampled
bit
of
paper
near
the
stove
corey
list
he
piled
up
the
money
counting
comparing
quick

dust
ordered
the
colonel
out

long
buckskin
bag

from
a
half
the
size

a
quarter

jack
and
made
a
motion
to
recover
let
it
alone
turn
out
everything
nuggets
a
miner
chamois
belt
unbuckled
and
flung
heavily
down
the
scales

and
rocked

pocket

the
belt

stuffed

the
rest

the
crack
of
the
door

look
here
jack

the
little
bag

jack
wet
his
dry
lips
and
nodded
yes
the
colonel
snatched
up
the
smaller
bag
and
thrust
it
into
the
hands
jack
made
for
the
door
the
colonel
stopped
him
better
take
to
the
woods
he
said
with
a
motion
back
towards
the
window
the
colonel
opened
the
door
and
looked
out
as
jack
pushed
aside
the
table
tore
away
the
red
curtain
hammered
at
the
sash
then
desperate
set
his
shoulder
at
it
and
forced
the
whole
thing
out
he
put
his
maimed
hand
on
the
sill
and
vaulted
after
the
shattered
glass
they
could
see
him
going
like
the
wind
up
towards
his
own
shack
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
looking
back
once
or
twice
doubling
and
tacking
to
keep
himself
screened
by
the
haphazard
hillside
cabins
out
of
sight
of
the
lynchers
down
at
the
river
will
you
stay
with
this
the
colonel
had
asked
keith
hurriedly
nodding
at
the
table
and
catching
up
the
block
before
jack
was
a
yard
from
the
window
yes
keith
had
said
revolver
still
in
hand
and
eyes
on
the
man
min√≥ok
was
to
see
no
more
the
colonel
met
the
boy
running
breathless
up
the
bank
ca
hold
any
longer
he
shouted
you
takin
it
pretty
easy
while
a
man
gettin
killed
down
here
stop
wait
the
colonel
floundered
madly
through
the
slush
and
mud
calling
and
gesticulating
i
got
the
thief
presto
all
the
backs
of
heads
became
faces
got
the
money
screamed
maudie
uncovering
her
eyes
she
had
gone
to
the
execution
but
after
the
rope
was
brought
her
nerve
failed
her
and
she
was
sobbing
hysterically
into
her
two
palms
held
right
over
her
eyes
oh
you
had
it
did
you
called
out
mcginty
with
easy
insolence
look
here
the
colonel
held
up
the
bit
of
flooring
with
rapid
explanation
where
is
he
got
him
locked
up
everybody
talked
at
once
the
colonel
managed
to
keep
them
going
for
some
moments
before
he
admitted
reckon
he
lit
out
and
then
the
colonel
got
it
hot
and
strong
for
his
clumsiness
which
way
he
go
the
colonel
turned
his
back
to
the
north
pole
and
made
a
fine
large
gesture
in
the
general
direction
of
the
equator
where
my
money
up
in
your
cabin
better
go
and
count
it
a
good
many
were
willing
to
help
since
they
been
cheated
out
of
a
hanging
and
even
defrauded
of
a
shot
at
a
thief
on
the
wing
nobody
seemed
to
care
to
remain
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
crooked
the
crowd
was
dispersing
somewhat
sheepishly
nobody
looked
at
butts
and
yet
he
was
a
sight
to
see
his
face
and
his
clothes
were
badly
mauled
he
was
covered
with
mud
and
blood
when
the
men
were
interrupted
in
trying
to
get
the
noose
over
his
head
he
had
stood
quite
still
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
till
it
broke
and
melted
away
from
him
he
looked
round
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
threw
open
his
torn
coat
and
felt
in
his
pockets
who
got
my
tobacco
says
he
several
men
turned
back
suddenly
and
several
pouches
were
held
out
but
nobody
met
butts
eyes
he
filled
his
pipe
nor
did
his
hand
shake
any
more
than
those
that
held
the
when
he
had
lit
up
who
got
my
smith
and
wesson
he
called
out
to
the
backs
of
the
retiring
citizens
windy
jim
stood
and
delivered
butts
walked
away
to
his
cabin
swaying
a
little
as
if
he
had
more
hootch
than

the
laugh
on
us
a
couple
of
hours
later
keith
put
an
excited
face
into
his
shack
where
the
colonel
and
the
boy
were
just
crawling
under
their
blankets
thought
you
might
like
to
know
that
miners
meeting
that
was
interrupted
is
having
an
extra
session
they
followed
him
down
to
the
court

a
fine
rain

night

heavy
and
thick
as
they
splashed
along
keith

there
was
room
enough
in
alaska
now
for

and
he
thought

took
his
gun
and

a
confused
noise

suddenly
out
of
the
big
cabin
they
were
nearing
they
opened
the
door
with
difficulty
and
forced
their
way
into
the
reeking
crowded
room
for
the
second
time
that
night
everybody
seemed
to
be
talking
nobody

through
dense
clouds

chapter
xix
the
ice
goes
out
i
am
apart
of
all
that
i
have
seen
it
had
been
thawing
and
freezing
freezing
and
thawing
for
so
long
that
men
lost
account
of
the
advance
of
a
summer
coming
with
such
balked
uncertain
steps
indeed
the
weather
variations
had
for
several
weeks
been
so
great
that
no
journey
not
the
smallest
could
be
calculated
with
any
assurance
the
last
men
to
reach
mino√≥k
were
two
who
had
made
a
hunting
and
prospecting
trip
to
an
outlying
district
they
had
gone
there
in
six
days
and
were
nineteen
in
returning
the
slush
was
in
the
gulches
on
the
benches
in
the
snow
holes
appeared
as
though
stones
had
been
thrown
upon
the
surface
the
little
settlement
by
the
mouth
of
the
mino√≥k
sat
insecurely
on
the
boggy
hillside
and
its
inhabitants
waded
in
soaking
tundra
moss
and
mire
and
now
down
on
the
water
was
beginning
to
run
on
the
marginal
ice
up
on
the
mountains
the
drifted
snow
was
whole
fields
of
it
gave
way
and
sunk
a
foot
under
any
adventurous
shoe
but
although
these
changes
had
been
wrought
slowly
with
backsets
of
bitter
nights
when
everything
was
frozen
hard
as
flint
the
illusion
was
general
that
summer
came
in
with
a
bound
on
the
of
may
mino√≥k
went
to
bed
in
winter
and
woke
to
find
the
snow
almost
gone
under
the
last
nineteen
hours
of
hot
unwinking
sunshine
and
the
first
geese
winging
their
way
up
the
valley
sight
to
stir
men
hearts
stranger
still
the
eight
months
arctic
silence
broken
suddenly
by
a
thousand
voices
under
every
a
summer
murmur
very
faint
at
first
but
hourly
louder
the
sound
of
falling
water
softly
singing
over
all
the
land
as
silence
had
been
the
distinguishing
feature
of
the
winter
so
was
noise
the
sign
of
the
spring
no
ear
so
dull
but
now
was
full
of
it
all
the
brooks
on
all
the
hills
tinkling
tumbling
babbling
of
some
great
and
universal
joy
all
the
streams
of
all
the
gulches
joining
with
every
little
rill
to
find
the
old
way
or
to
carve
a
new
back
to
the
father
of
waters
and
the
strange
thing
had
happened
on
the
yukon
the
of
the
ice
seemed
sunken
and
the
water
ran
yet
deeper
there
but
of
a
certainty
the
middle
part
had
risen
the
cheechalkos
thought
it
an
optical
illusion
but
old
brandt
from
had
seen
the
ice
go
out
for
years
and
he
said
it
went
out
always
so
humps
his
back
an
gits
up
gits
and
when
he
a
gitten
jest
look
out
those
who
in
spite
of
warning
ventured
in
down
on
the
found
that
in
places
the
under
side
of
the
ice
was
worn
nearly
through
if
you
bent
your
head
and
listened
you
could
plainly
hear
that
greater
music
of
the
river
running
underneath
low
as
yet
but
deep
and
strangely
stirring
dominating
in
the
hearer
ears
all
the
clear
high
clamour
from
gulch
and
hill
in
some
men
hearts
the
ice
went
out
at
the
sound
and
the
melting
welled
up
in
their
eyes
summer
and
liberty
were
very
near
oh
hurry
yukon
inua
let
the
ice
go
out
and
let
the
boats
come
in
but
the
next
few
days
hung
heavily
the
humped
its
back
still
higher
but
showed
no
disposition
to
git
the
wonder
was
it
did
not
crack
under
the
strain
but
northern
ice
ahs
the
air
of
being
strangely
flexile
several
feet
in
depth
the
water
ran
now
along
the
margin
more
geese
and
ducks
appeared
and
flocks
of
little
birds
canada
jays
robins
joined
the
swelling
chorus
of
the
waters
oh
hurry
hurry
inua
and
open
the
great
highway
not
at
min√≥ok
alone
at
every
wood
camp
mining
town
and
mission
at
every
white
post
and
indian
village
all
along
the
yukon
groups
were
gathered
waiting
the
great
moment
of
the
year
no
one
had
ever
heard
of
the
ice
breaking
up
before
the
of
may
or
later
than
the
and
yet
men
had
begun
to
keep
a
hopeful
eye
on
the
river
from
the
of
april
when
a
white
ptarmigan
was
reported
wearing
a
collar
of
feathers
and
his
wings
tipped
brown
that
was
a
month
ago
and
the
great
moment
could
not
possibly
be
far
now
the
first
thing
everybody
did
on
getting
up
and
the
last
thing
everybody
did
on
going
to
bed
was
to
look
at
the
river
it
was
not
easy
to
go
to
bed
and
even
if
you
got
so
far
it
was
not
easy
to
sleep
the
sun
poured
into
the
cabins
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
and
there
was
nothing
to
divide
one
part
of
the
hours
from
another
you
slept
when
you
were
too
tired
to
watch
the
river
you
breakfasted
like
as
not
at
six
in
the
evening
you
dined
at
midnight
through
all
your
waking
hours
you
kept
an
eye
on
the
window
overlooking
the
river
in
your
bed
you
listened
for
that
ancient
yukon
cry
the
ice
is
going
out
for
ages
it
had
meant
to
the
timid
beware
the
fury
of
the
shattered
beware
the
caprice
of
the
flood
watch
lest
many
lives
go
out
with
the
ice
as
aforetime
and
for
ages
to
the
it
had
meant
make
ready
the
kyaks
and
the
birch
canoes
see
that
tackle
and
traps
are
strong
for
plenty
or
famine
wait
upon
the
hour
as
the
white
men
waited
for
boats
the
men
of
the
older
time
had
waited
for
the
salmon
for
those
first
impatient
adventurers
that
would
force
their
way
under
the
very
tenderest
and
best
of
the
catch
as
eager
to
prosecute
that
journey
from
the
ocean
to
the
klondyke
as
if
they
had
been
men
marching
after
the
gold
boom
no
one
could
settle
to
anything
it
was
by
fits
and
starts
that
the
steadier
hands
indulged
even
in
target
practice
with
a
feverish
subconsciousness
that
events
were
on
the
way
that
might
make
it
inconvenient
to
have
lost
the
art
of
sending
a
bullet
straight
after
a
diminutive
tin
can
hung
on
a
tree
had
been
made
to
jump
at
a
hundred
paces
the
marksman
would
glance
at
the
river
and
forget
to
fire
it
was
by
fits
and
starts
that
they
even
drank
deeper
or
played
for
higher
stakes
the
wheel
of
fortune
in
the
gold
nugget
was
in
special
demand
it
was
a
means
of
trying
your
luck
with
satisfactory
despatch
between
drinks
or
between
long
bouts
of
staring
at
the
river
men
stood
in
at
their
cabin
doors
in
the
unwinking
sunshine
looking
up
the
valley
or
down
betting
that
the
first
boat
in
would
be
one
of
those
nearest
neighbours
may
west
or
muckluck
coming
up
from
woodworth
others
as
ready
to
back
heavily
their
opinion
that
the
first
blast
of
the
steam
whistle
would
come
down
on
the
flood
from
circle
or
from
dawson
the
colonel
had
bought
and
donned
a
new
suit
of
store
clothes
and
urged
on
his
companion
the
necessity
of
at
least
a
whole
pair
of
breeches
in
honour
of
his
entrance
into
the
klondyke
but
the
funds
were
low
and
his
vanity
chastened
besides
he
had
other
business
on
his
mind
after
sending
several
requests
for
the
immediate
return
of
his
dog
requests
that
received
no
attention
the
boy
went
out
to
the
gulch
to
recover
him
nig
new
master
paid
up
all
arrears
of
wages
readily
enough
but
declined
to
surrender
the
dog
oh
no
the
ice
thinkin
o
goin
out
yit
i
want
my
dog
you
git
him
sure
i
glad
you
understand
that
much
i
bring
him
up
to
rampart
in
time
for
the
first
boat
where
my
dog
no
answer
the
boy
whistled
no
nig
dread
masked
itself
in
choler
he
jumped
on
the
fellow
forced
him
down
and
hammered
him
till
he
cried
for
mercy
where
my
dog
then
he
he
up
to
idyho
bar
whimpered
the
prostrate
one
and
there
the
boy
found
him
staggering
under
a
pair
of
hired
out
to
mike
for
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
day
together
they
returned
to
rampart
to
watch
for
the
boat
certainly
the
ice
was
very
late
breaking
up
this
year
the
men
of
rampart
stood
about
in
groups
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
of
the
of
may
as
usual
smoking
yarning
speculating
inventing
elaborate
joshes
somebody
remembered
that
certain
cheechalkos
had
gone
to
bed
at
midnight
now
this
was
unprecedented
even
impertinent
if
the
river
is
not
open
by
the
middle
of
may
your
may
go
to
bed
only
he
does
still
he
may
do
as
he
lists
but
your
cheechalko
why
this
is
the
hour
of
his
initiation
it
was
as
if
a
man
should
yawn
at
his
marriage
or
refuse
to
sleep
at
his
funeral
the
offenders
were
some
of
those
woodworth
fellows
who
with
a
dozen
or
so
others
had
built
shacks
below
the
street
yet
well
above
the
river
at
two
in
the
morning
saunders
knocked
them
up
the
ice
is
goin
out
in
a
flash
the
sleepers
stood
at
the
door
only
a
josh
one
showed
fight
well
it
true
what
i
tellin
yer
persisted
saunders
seriously
the
ice
is
goin
out
and
it
goin
soon
and
when
you
washed
out
o
yer
bunks
ye
need
blame
me
fur
i
warned
yer
you
do
mean
the
flood
come
up
here
mebbe
you
arranged
so
she
wo
this
year
the
cheechalkos
consulted
in
the
end
four
of
them
occupied
the
next
two
hours
to
the
infinite
but
masked
amusement
of
the
town
in
floundering
about
in
the
mud
setting
up
tents
in
the
boggy
wood
above
the
settlement
and
with
much
pains
transporting
thither
as
many
of
their
possessions
as
they
did
not
lose
in
the
bottomless
pit
of
the
mire
when
the
business
was
ended
min√≥ok
gave
way
the
cheechalkos
found
themselves
the
of
the
town
the
others
who
had
dared
to
build
down
on
the
bank
but
who
had
scared
worth
a
cent
sauntered
up
to
the
gold
nugget
to
enjoy
the
increased
esteem
of
the
and
the
humiliation
of
the
men
who
had
thought
the
yukon
was
goin
over
the
ramparts
this
year
haw
haw
it
surprises
the
average
mind
to
discover
that
one
of
most
delicate
weapons
is
in
such
use
and
is
so
potently
dreaded
among
the
roughest
frontier
spirits
no
fine
gentleman
in
a
no
sensitive
girl
shrinks
more
from
what
meredith
calls
the
comic
laugh
none
feels
irony
more
keenly
than
your
ordinary
american
pioneer
the
men
who
had
moved
up
into
the
soaking
wood
saw
they
had
run
a
risk
as
great
to
them
as
the
fabled
danger
of
the
river
the
risk
of
the
josher
irony
the
dire
humiliation
of
the
laugh
if
a
man
up
here
does
you
an
injury
and
you
kill
him
you
have
after
all
taken
the
ultimate
revenge
you
might
have
got
the
laugh
on
him
and
let
him
live
to
hear
it
while
all
min√≥ok
was
jollying
the
woodworth
men
maudie
made
one
of
her
sudden
raids
out
of
the
gold
nugget
she
stood
nearly
up
to
the
knees
of
her
high
rubber
boots
in
the
bog
of
main
street
talking
earnestly
with
the
colonel
keith
and
the
boy
sitting
on
a
store
box
outside
of
the
saloon
had
looked
on
at
the
fun
over
the
timid
cheechalkos
and
looked
on
now
at
maudie
and
the
colonel
it
crossed
the
boy
mind
that
they
be
putting
up
a
josh
on
his
pardner
pretty
soon
and
at
the
thought
he
frowned
keith
had
been
saying
that
the
old
miners
had
nearly
all
got
squawed
he
had
spoken
almost
superstitiously
of
the
queer
lasting
effect
of
the
supposedly
temporary
arrangement
no
they
do
leave
their
wives
as
often
as
you
expect
but
in
most
cases
it
seems
to
kill
the
pride
of
the
man
he
gives
up
all
idea
of
ever
going
home
and
even
if
he
makes
a
fortune
they
say
he
stays
on
here
and
year
by
year
he
sinks
lower
and
lower
till
he
farther
down
in
the
scale
of
things
human
than
his
savage
wife
yes
it
awful
to
think
how
the
life
up
here
can
take
the
stiffening
out
of
a
fella
he
looked
darkly
at
the
two
out
there
in
the
mud
keith
nodded
strong
men
have
lain
down
on
the
trail
this
winter
and
cried
but
it
was
that
sort
of
thing
the
other
meant
keith
followed
his
new
friend
glowering
looks
yes
that
just
the
kind
of
man
that
gets
taken
in
what
said
the
boy
brusquely
just
the
sort
that
goes
and
marries
some
flighty
creature
well
said
his
pardner
haughtily
he
could
afford
to
marry
flighty
creature
the
colonel
got
both
feet
on
the
ground
and
keith
felt
properly
snubbed
but
what
maudie
was
saying
to
the
colonel
was
you
goin
up
in
the
first
boat
i
yes
looks
like
i
be
the
only
person
left
in
min√≥ok
i
do
imagine
you
be
quite
alone
no
why
there
only
between
five
and
six
hundred
expectin
to
board
a
boat
that
be
crowded
before
she
gets
here
does
everybody
want
to
go
to
dawson
everybody
except
a
few
boomers
who
mean
to
stay
long
enough
to
play
off
their
misery
on
someone
else
before
they
move
on
the
colonel
looked
a
trifle
anxious
i
had
thought
of
that
i
suppose
there
will
be
a
race
for
the
boat
there
be
a
race
all
the
way
up
the
river
for
all
the
early
boats
ai
half
enough
to
carry
the
people
but
you
look
to
me
like
stand
as
good
a
chance
as
most
and
anyhow
you
the
one
man
i
know
i
trust
my
dough
to
the
colonel
stared
you
see
i
want
to
get
some
money
to
my
kiddie
an
besides
i
got
kind
o
scared
about
keepin
dust
in
my
cabin
i
want
it
in
a
bank
so
if
i
should
kick
the
bucket
there
be
some
pretty
high
rollin
here
when
there
been
a
few
boats
in
and
my
life
no
better
than
any
other
feller
i
feel
a
lot
easier
if
i
knew
the
have
six
thousand
clear
even
if
i
did
turn
up
my
toes
see
a
yes
i
see
but
the
door
of
the
cabin
next
the
saloon
opened
suddenly
a
graybeard
with
a
young
face
came
out
rubbing
the
sleep
from
his
eyes
he
stared
interrogatively
at
the
river
and
then
to
the
world
in
general
what
time
is
it
four
mornin
or
evenin
and
no
one
thought
the
question
strange
maudie
lowered
her
voice
no
need
to
mention
it
to
pardners
and
people
you
do
want
every
feller
to
know
you
goin
about
loaded
but
will
you
take
my
dust
up
to
dawson
and
get
it
sent
to
on
the
first
boat
the
ice
the
ice
it
moving
the
ice
is
going
out
look
the
ice
from
end
to
end
of
the
settlement
the
cry
was
taken
up
people
darted
out
of
cabins
like
beavers
out
of
their
burrows
three
little
indian
boys
yelling
with
excitement
tore
past
the
gold
nugget
crying
now
in
their
mother
min√≥ok
now
in
their
english
the
ice
is
going
out
from
the
depths
of
the
whereon
his
master
had
sat
nig
darted
howling
excitedly
and
waving
a
muddy
tail
like
a
draggled
banner
saying
in
mahlemeut
the
ice
is
going
out
the
fish
are
coming
in
all
the
other
dogs
waked
and
gave
tongue
running
in
and
out
among
the
huddled
rows
of
people
gathered
on
the
ramparts
every
ear
full
of
the
rubbing
grinding
noise
that
came
up
out
of
the
yukon
noise
not
loud
but
deep
an
undercurrent
of
heavy
sound
as
they
stood
there
gaping
their
solid
winter
world
began
to
move
a
compact
mass
of
ice
of
a
mile
wide
and
four
miles
long
with
a
great
grinding
and
crushing
went
down
the
valley
some
distance
below
the
town
it
jammed
building
with
incredible
quickness
a
barrier
twenty
feet
high
the
people
waited
breathless
again
the
trembled
but
the
watchers
lifted
their
eyes
to
the
heights
above
was
that
thunder
in
the
hills
no
the
ice
again
again
crushing
grinding
to
the
low
accompaniment
of
thunder
that
seemed
to
come
from
far
away
sections
a
mile
long
and
half
a
mile
wide
were
forced
up
carried
over
the
first
and
summarily
stopped
below
the
barrier
huge
pieces
broken
off
from
the
sides
came
crunching
their
way
angrily
up
the
bank
as
if
acting
on
some
independent
impulse
there
they
sat
great
fragments
glistening
in
the
sunlight
as
big
as
cabins
it
was
something
to
see
them
come
walking
up
the
shelving
bank
the
cheechalkos
who
laughed
before
are
contented
now
with
running
leaving
their
goods
behind
saunders
himself
never
dreamed
the
ice
would
push
its
way
so
far
in
a
still
unbroken
sheet
is
bent
yet
more
in
the
centre
every
now
and
then
a
wide
crack
opens
near
the
margin
and
the
water
rushes
out
with
a
roar
once
more
the
mass
is
nearly
still
and
now
all
silent
not
till
the
water
dammed
and
thrown
back
by
the
ice
not
until
it
rises
many
feet
and
comes
down
with
a
volume
and
momentum
irresistible
will
the
final
conflict
come
hour
after
hour
the
people
stand
there
on
the
bank
waiting
to
see
the
barrier
go
down
unwillingly
as
the
time
goes
on
this
one
that
one
hurries
away
for
a
few
minutes
to
prepare
and
devour
a
meal
back
again
breathless
upon
rumour
of
that
preparatory
trembling
that
strange
thrilling
of
the
ice
the
grinding
and
the
crushing
had
begun
again
the
long
tension
the
mysterious
sounds
the
sense
of
some
great
unbridled
power
at
work
wrought
on
the
steadiest
nerves
people
did
the
oddest
things
down
at
the
lower
end
of
the
town
a
couple
of
miners
sick
of
the
scurvy
had
painfully
clambered
on
their
roof
whether
to
see
the
sights
or
be
out
of
harm
way
no
one
knew
the
stingiest
man
in
min√≥ok
who
had
refused
to
help
them
in
their
cabin
carried
them
food
on
the
roof
a
woman
made
and
took
them
the
yukon
remedy
for
their
disease
they
sat
in
state
in
sight
of
all
men
and
drank
spruce
tea
by
one
in
the
afternoon
the
river
had
risen
eight
feet
but
the
ice
barrier
still
held
the
people
worn
out
went
away
to
sleep
all
that
night
the
barrier
held
though
more
ice
came
down
and
still
the
water
rose
twelve
feet
now
the
ranks
of
shattered
ice
along
the
shore
are
claimed
again
as
the
flood
widens
and
licks
them
in
the
cheechalkos
cabins
are
flooded
to
the
caves
stout
fellows
in
take
a
boat
and
rescue
the
from
the
roof
and
still
the
barrier
held
people
began
to
go
about
their
usual
avocations
the
empty
gold
nugget
filled
again
men
sat
as
they
had
done
all
the
winter
drinking
and
reading
the
news
of
eight
months
before
out
of
soiled
and
tattered
papers
late
the
following
day
everyone
started
up
at
a
new
sound
again
miners
indians
and
dogs
lined
the
bank
saw
the
piled
ice
masses
tremble
heard
a
crashing
and
grinding
as
of
mountains
of
glass
hurled
together
saw
the
barrier
give
way
and
the
frozen
wastes
move
down
on
the
bosom
of
the
flood
higher
yet
the
water
rose
the
current
ran
eight
miles
an
hour
and
now
the
ice
masses
were
less
enormous
more
broken
somewhere
far
below
another
jam
another
long
bout
of
waiting
birds
are
singing
everywhere
between
the
white
snowdrifts
the
arctic
moss
shows
green
and
yellow
white
flowers
star
the
hills
half
the
town
is
packed
ready
to
catch
the
boat
at
five
notice
with
door
barred
and
red
curtain
down
maudie
is
doing
up
her
for
the
colonel
to
take
to
dawson
the
man
who
had
washed
it
out
of
a
birch
creek
placer
and
blowed
it
in
fur
the
girl
up
on
the
hillside
he
sleeps
sound
the
two
who
had
broken
the
record
for
winter
travel
on
the
yukon
side
by
side
in
the
sunshine
on
a
plank
laid
across
two
mackerel
firkins
sit
and
watch
the
brimming
flood
they
speak
of
the
big
chimney
men
picture
them
packed
and
waiting
for
the
oklahoma
wonder
what
they
have
done
with
kaviak
and
what
the
three
months
have
brought
them
when
we
started
out
that
day
from
the
big
chimney
we
thought
we
be
made
if
only
we
managed
to
reach
min√≥ok
well
we
got
what
we
came
for
each
got
a
claim
oh
yes
a
good
claim
too
guess
so
do
you
know
the
gold
there
yes
but
where
are
the
miners
you
and
i
do
propose
to
spend
the
next
ten
years
in
gettin
that
gold
out
no
but
there
are
plenty
who
would
if
we
gave
the
chance
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
give
the
right
ones
the
chance
the
colonel
wore
an
air
of
reflection
the
district
will
be
opened
up
the
boy
went
on
cheerfully
and
we
have
people
beggin
us
to
let
get
out
our
gold
and
givin
us
the
lion
share
for
the
privilege
do
you
altogether
like
the
sound
o
that
i
expect
like
other
people
i
like
the
result
we
ought
to
see
some
things
clearer
than
other
people
we
had
our
lesson
on
the
trail
said
the
colonel
quietly
nobody
ought
ever
to
be
able
to
fool
us
about
the
power
and
the
value
of
the
individual
apart
from
society
seems
as
if
association
did
make
value
in
the
absence
of
men
and
markets
a
pit
full
of
gold
is
worth
no
more
than
a
pit
full
of
clay
oh
yes
i
admit
till
the
boats
come
in
we
poor
men
nobody
will
stop
here
this
summer
they
all
be
racing
on
to
dawson
dawson
beyond
a
doubt
the
colonel
laughed
a
little
ruefully
we
used
to
say
min√≥ok
i
said
min√≥ok
just
to
sound
reasonable
but
of
course
i
meant
dawson
and
they
sat
there
thinking
watching
the
meet
crash
go
down
in
foam
and
come
up
again
on
the
lower
reaches
the
boy
idly
swinging
the
great
katharine
medal
to
and
fro
in
his
buckskin
pocket
it
has
worn
so
bright
it
catches
at
the
light
like
a
coin
fresh
from
the
mint
no
doubt
muckluck
is
on
the
at
pymeut
the
prince
the
yagorsha
even
ol
chief
no
one
will
be
indoors
sitting
there
together
they
saw
the
last
stand
made
by
the
ice
and
shared
that
moment
when
the
final
barrier
somewhere
far
below
gave
way
with
boom
and
thunder
the
mighty
flood
ran
free
tearing
up
trees
by
their
roots
as
it
ran
detaching
masses
of
rock
dissolving
islands
into
swirling
sand
and
drift
carving
new
channels
making
and
unmaking
the
land
the
water
began
to
fall
it
had
been
a
great
time
it
was
ended
pardner
says
the
colonel
we
seen
the
ice
go
out
no
fella
can
call
you
and
me
cheechalkos
after
no
sah
we
travelled
the
long
trail
we
seen
the
ice
go
out
and
we
friends
yet
the
kentuckian
took
his
pardner
brown
hand
with
a
gentle
solemnity
seemed
about
to
say
something
but
stopped
and
turned
his
bronzed
face
to
the
flood
carried
back
upon
some
sudden
tide
within
himself
to
those
black
days
on
the
trail
that
he
wanted
most
in
the
world
to
forget
but
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
all
dear
things
all
things
kind
and
precious
his
home
a
woman
face
all
all
would
fade
before
he
forgot
those
last
days
on
the
trail
the
record
of
that
journey
was
burnt
into
the
brain
of
the
men
who
had
made
it
on
that
stretch
of
the
long
trail
the
elder
had
grown
old
and
the
younger
had
forever
lost
his
youth
not
only
had
the
roundness
gone
out
of
his
face
not
only
was
it
scarred
but
such
lines
were
graven
there
as
commonly
takes
the
antique
pencil
half
a
score
of
years
to
trace
something
has
happened
the
colonel
said
quite
low
we
are
the
same
men
who
left
the
big
chimney
right
said
the
boy
with
a
laugh
unwilling
as
yet
to
accept
his
own
personal
revelation
preferring
to
put
a
superficial
interpretation
on
his
companion
words
he
glanced
at
the
colonel
and
his
face
changed
a
little
but
still
he
would
not
understand
looking
down
at
the
chaparejos
that
he
had
been
so
proud
of
sadly
abbreviated
to
make
boots
for
nig
jagged
here
and
there
and
with
fringes
now
not
all
intentional
it
suited
him
to
pretend
that
the
shaps
had
suffered
most
yes
the
ice
takes
the
kinks
out
whether
the
thing
that
happened
is
good
or
evil
i
do
pretend
to
say
the
other
went
on
gravely
staring
at
the
river
i
only
know
something
happened
there
were
possibilities
in
me
anyhow
that
have
been
frozen
to
death
yes
we
different
the
boy
roused
himself
but
only
to
persist
in
his
misinterpretation
you
ai
different
to
hurt
if
i
started
out
again
tomorrow
the
lord
forbid
amen
but
if
i
had
to
you
the
only
man
in
alaska
in
the
world
i
want
for
my
pardner
boy
he
wrestled
with
a
slight
bronchial
huskiness
cleared
his
throat
tried
again
and
gave
it
up
contenting
himself
with
beg
your
pardon
for
callin
you
you
a
seasoned
sah
and
the
boy
felt
as
if
some
sovereign
had
dubbed
him
knight
in
a
day
or
two
now
from
north
or
south
the
first
boat
must
appear
the
willows
were
unfolding
their
silver
leaves
the
were
bursting
geese
and
teal
and
mallard
swarmed
about
the
river
margin
especially
where
the
equisetae
showed
the
tips
of
their
feathery
green
tails
above
the
mud
ducks
flocked
and
feasted
people
were
too
excited
too
busy
they
said
looking
for
the
boats
to
do
much
shooting
the
shy
birds
waxed
daring
keith
standing
by
his
shack
knocked
over
a
mallard
within
forty
paces
of
his
door
it
was
eight
days
after
that
first
cry
the
ice
is
going
out
four
since
the
final
jam
gave
way
and
let
the
floes
run
free
that
at
one
in
the
afternoon
the
shout
went
up
a
boat
a
boat
only
a
lumberman
bateau
but
two
men
were
poling
her
down
the
current
with
a
skill
that
matched
the
speed
they
swung
her
in
a
dozen
hands
caught
at
the
painter
and
made
fast
a
young
man
stepped
ashore
and
introduced
himself
as
van
alen
benham
upper
river
pardner
on
the
way
to
anvik
his
companion
donovan
was
from
circle
city
and
brought
appalling
news
the
boats
depended
on
for
the
early
summer
traffic
bella
and
three
other
and
steamers
as
well
as
the
victoria
and
the
michael
had
been
lifted
up
by
the
ice
like
so
many
feathers
forced
clean
out
of
the
channel
and
left
high
and
dry
on
a
sandy
ridge
with
an
ice
wall
eighty
feet
wide
and
fifteen
high
between
them
and
open
water
all
the
crews
hard
at
work
with
jackscrews
said
donovan
and
if
they
can
get
skids
under
and
a
channel
blasted
through
the
ice
they
may
get
the
boats
down
here
in
fifteen
or
twenty
days
a
heavy
blow
but
instantly
everyone
began
to
talk
of
the
may
west
and
the
muckluck
as
though
all
along
they
had
looked
for
succour
to
come
rather
than
down
but
as
the
precious
hours
passed
a
deep
dejection
fastened
on
the
camp
there
had
been
a
year
when
through
one
disaster
after
another
no
boats
had
got
to
the
upper
river
not
even
the
arrival
from
dawson
of
the
montana
kid
pugilist
and
gambler
could
raise
spirits
so
cast
down
not
even
though
he
was
said
to
bring
strange
news
from
outside
there
was
war
in
the
world
down
yonder
war
had
been
formally
declared
between
america
and
spain
windy
slapped
his
thigh
in
humourous
despair
why
had
he
thought
o
gettin
off
a
josh
like
that
to
those
who
listened
to
the
montana
kid
to
the
fretted
spirits
of
men
eight
months
imprisoned
the
states
and
her
foreign
affairs
were
far
away
indeed
and
as
for
the
other
party
to
the
rumoured
war
spain
they
clutched
at
school
memories
of
columbus
americans
finding
through
him
the
way
to
spain
as
through
him
spaniards
had
found
the
way
to
america
so
spain
was
not
merely
a
state
historic
she
was
still
in
the
active
world
but
what
did
these
things
matter
boats
mattered
the
place
where
the
klondykers
were
caught
this
min√≥ok
mattered
and
so
did
the
place
they
wanted
to
reach
dawson
mattered
most
of
all
by
the
narrowed
habit
of
long
months
dawson
was
the
centre
of
the
universe
more
little
boats
going
down
and
still
nothing
going
up
men
said
gloomily
we
done
for
the
fellows
who
go
by
the
canadian
route
will
get
everything
the
dawson
season
will
be
half
over
before
we
in
the
field
if
we
ever
are
the
of
may
still
no
steamer
had
come
but
the
mosquitoes
had
bloodthirsty
beyond
any
the
temperate
climates
know
it
was
clear
that
some
catastrophe
had
befallen
the
woodworth
boats
and
nig
had
been
lured
away
by
his
quondam
master
no
they
had
not
gone
back
to
the
gulch
that
was
too
easy
the
man
had
a
mind
to
keep
the
dog
and
since
he
was
not
allowed
to
buy
him
he
would
do
the
other
thing
he
had
not
been
gone
an
hour
rumour
said
had
taken
a
scow
and
provisions
and
dropped
down
the
river
utterly
desperate
the
boy
seized
his
new
nulato
gun
and
somebody
else
canoe
without
so
much
as
inquiring
whose
he
shot
down
the
swift
current
after
the
he
roared
back
to
the
remonstrating
colonel
that
he
did
care
if
an
steamer
did
come
while
he
was
gone
he
was
goin
gunnin
at
the
same
time
he
shared
the
now
general
opinion
that
a
lower
river
boat
would
reach
them
first
and
he
was
only
going
to
meet
her
meting
justice
by
the
way
he
had
gone
safely
more
than
ten
miles
down
when
suddenly
as
he
was
passing
an
island
he
stood
up
in
his
boat
balanced
himself
and
cocked
his
gun
down
there
on
the
left
a
man
was
standing
in
the
water
trying
to
free
his
boat
from
a
fallen
tree
a
siwash
dog
watched
him
from
the
bank
the
boy
whistled
the
dog
threw
up
his
nose
yapped
and
whined
the
man
had
turned
sharply
saw
his
enemy
and
the
levelled
gun
he
jumped
into
the
boat
but
she
was
filling
while
he
bailed
the
dog
ran
along
the
island
howling
fit
to
raise
the
dead
when
he
was
a
little
above
the
boy
boat
he
plunged
into
the
river
nig
was
a
good
swimmer
but
the
current
here
would
tax
the
best
the
boy
found
himself
so
occupied
with
saving
nig
from
a
watery
grave
while
he
kept
the
canoe
from
capsizing
that
he
forgot
all
about
the
thief
till
a
turn
in
the
river
shut
him
out
of
sight
the
canoe
was
moored
and
while
trying
to
restrain
nig
dripping
caresses
his
master
looked
up
and
saw
something
queer
off
there
above
the
tops
of
the
cottonwoods
as
he
looked
he
forgot
the
dog
forgot
everything
in
earth
or
heaven
except
that
narrow
cloud
wavering
along
the
sky
he
sat
immovable
in
the
attitude
learned
in
pulling
a
against
a
gale
from
the
pole
if
you
are
moderately
excited
you
may
start
but
there
is
an
excitement
that
nails
you
nig
shook
his
wolf
coat
and
sprayed
the
water
far
and
wide
made
little
joyful
noises
and
licked
the
face
that
was
so
still
but
his
master
like
a
man
of
stone
stared
at
that
long
gray
pennon
in
the
sky
if
it
is
a
steamer
what
is
it
like
an
echo
out
of
some
lesson
he
had
learned
and
long
forgot
boats
do
run
the
channel
they
have
to
hunt
for
easy
water
suddenly
he
leaped
up
the
canoe
tipped
and
nig
went
a
second
time
into
the
water
well
for
him
that
they
were
near
the
shore
he
could
jump
in
without
help
this
time
no
hand
held
out
no
eye
for
him
his
master
had
dragged
the
painter
free
seized
the
oars
and
saying
harshly
lie
down
you
black
devil
he
pulled
back
against
the
current
with
every
ounce
he
had
in
him
for
the
gray
pennon
was
going
round
the
other
side
of
the
island
and
the
boy
was
losing
the
boat
to
dawson
nig
sat
perkily
in
the
bow
never
budging
till
his
master
running
into
the
head
of
the
island
caught
up
a
handful
of
tough
root
fringes
and
holding
fast
by
them
waved
his
cap
and
shouted
like
one
possessed
let
go
the
fringes
caught
up
his
gun
and
fired
then
nig
realising
that
for
once
in
a
way
noise
seemed
to
be
popular
pointed
his
nose
at
the
big
object
hugging
the
farther
shore
and
howled
with
a
right
goodwill
they
see
they
see
hooray
the
boy
waved
his
arms
embraced
nig
then
snatched
up
the
oars
the
steamer
engines
were
reversed
now
she
was
still
the
boy
pulled
lustily
a
crowded
ship
crew
and
passengers
pressed
to
the
rails
the
steamer
canted
and
the
captain
orders
rang
out
clear
several
cheechalkos
laid
their
hands
on
their
guns
as
the
wild
fellow
in
the
ragged
buckskins
shot
round
the
motionless
wheel
and
brought
his
canoe
while
his
dog
still
kept
the
echoes
of
the
lower
ramparts
calling
three
cheers
for
the
oklahoma
at
the
sound
of
the
boy
voice
a
red
face
hanging
over
the
stern
broke
into
a
broad
grin
be
the
siven
air
ye
the
little
divvle
himself
or
air
ye
the
the
apparition
in
the
canoe
was
making
fast
and
preparing
to
board
the
ship
ca
take
another
passenger
full
up
said
the
captain
he
hear
what
was
said
in
reply
but
he
shook
his
head
been
refusin
right
along
then
as
if
reproached
by
the
look
in
the
wild
young
face
we
thought
you
were
in
trouble
so
i
am
if
you
wo
i
tell
you
we
got
every
ounce
we
can
carry
oh
take
me
back
to
min√≥ok
anyway
he
said
a
few
words
about
fare
to
the
captain
back
as
that
magnate
did
not
distinctly
say
no
indeed
walked
off
making
conversation
with
the
engineer
twenty
hands
helped
the
new
passenger
to
get
nig
and
the
canoe
on
board
well
got
a
asked

the

the
boy
tore
himself
away
from
his
old
friends
and
followed
the
arbiter
of
his
fate
the
engines
had
started
up
again
and
they
were
going
on
i
told
said
the
captain
rather
severely
that
min√≥ok
a
busted
camp
oh
is
it
returned
the
ragged
one
cheerfully
then
he
remembered
that
this
captain
rainey
had
a
man
in
the
autumn
a
man
who
was
reported
to
know
where
to
look
for
the
mother
lode
the
mighty
parent
of
the
yukon
placers
i
can
tell
you
the
facts
about
min√≥ok
he
followed
the
captain
up
on
the
giving
him
details
about
the
new
strike
and
the
wonderful
richness
of
idaho
bar
nobody
would
know
about
it
but
that
the
right
man
went
prospecting
there
one
in
the
eye
for
whoever
said
min√≥ok
was
busted
and
another
for
the
prospector
rainey
had
sent
to
look
for
you
see
men
like
pitcairn
have
given
up
lookin
for
the
mother
lode
they
say
you
might
as
well
look
for
mother
eve
you
got
to
make
out
with
her
descendants
yukon
gold
pitcairn
says
comes
from
an
older
rock
series
than
this
he
stood
in
the
shower
of
sparks
constantly
spraying
from
the
to
the
fireproof
deck
and
he
waved
his
hand
airily
at
the
red
rock
of
the
ramparts
far
older
than
any
of
these
the
gold
up
here
has
all
come
out
o
rock
that
went
out
o
the
rock
business
millions
o
years
ago
most
o
that
mother
lode
the
miners
are
for
is
sand
now
thirteen
hundred
miles
away
in
norton
sound
just
my
luck
said
the
captain
gloomily
going
a
little
as
though
definitely
giving
up
mining
and
returning
to
his
own
proper
business
but
the
rest
o
the
mother
lode
the
gold
and
magnetic
iron
was
too
heavy
to
travel
that
what
linin
the
gold
basins
o
the
north
linin
idaho
bar
thick
the
captain
sighed
twelve
a
voice
sang
out
on
the
lower
deck
twelve
repeated
the
captain
twelve
echoed
the
pilot
at
the
wheel
twelve
and
a
half
from
the
man
below
a
tall
lean
fellow
casting
the
with
a
rhythmic
nonchalance
he
plants
the
long
black
and
white
staff
at
the
ship
side
draws
it
up
dripping
plunges
it
down
again
draws
it
up
and
sends
it
down
hour
after
hour
he
never
seems
to
tire
he
never
seems
to
see
anything
but
the
never
to
say
anything
but
what
he
is
chanting
now
twelve
and
a
half
or
some
variation
merely
numerical
you
come
to
think
him
as
little
human
as
the
calendar
only
that
his
numbers
are
told
off
with
the
significance
of
sound
the
suggested
menace
of
a
cry
if
the
sounding
comes
too
near
the
steamer
draught
or
the
pilot
fails
to
hear
the
reading
the
captain
repeats
it
he
often
does
so
when
there
is
no
need
it
is
a
form
of
conversation
noncommittal
yet
smacking
of
authority
ten
ten
echoed
the
pilot
while
the
captain
was
admitting
that
he
had
been
mining
vicariously
for
twenty
years
and
never
made
a
cent
always
keep
thinkin
i
soon
be
able
to
give
up
steamboatin
and
buy
a
farm
he
shook
his
head
as
one
who
sees
his
last
hope
fade
but
his
ragged
companion
turned
suddenly
and
while
the
sparks
fell
in
a
fresh
shower
well
captain
says
he
you
got
the
chance
of
your
life
right
now
ten
and
a
half
just
what
they
all
said
wish
i
had
the
money
i
wasted
on
the
ragged
one
thrust
his
hands
in
the

of

pitcairn

pretty
well
ever
since

indians
no
seems
to
have
been
a
bigger
job
than
even
white

could
manage

no
sir
waitin
for
us
to
do
that
waitin
now
up
on
idaho
bar
the
captain
looked
at
him
trying
to
conceal
the
envy
in
his
soul
they
were
sounding
low
water
but
he
never
heard
he
looked
round
sharply
as
the
course
changed
i
done
my
assessment
the
ragged
man
went
on
joyously
and
going
to
dawson
this
was
bad
navigation
he
felt
instantly
he
had
struck
a
snag
the
captain
smiled
and
passed
on
sounding
nine
and
a
half
but
i
got
a
fortune
on
the
bar
i
not
a
boomer
but
i
believe
in
the
bar
six
six
gettin
into
low
water
again
the
steamer
swung
out
hunting
a
new
channel
pitcairn
opinion
is
thought
a
lot
of
the
geologic
survey
men
listen
to
pitcairn
he
helped
them
one
year
he
one
of
those
extraordinary
old
miners
who
can
tell
from
the
look
of
things
without
even
panning
when
he
saw
that
pyrites
on
idaho
bar
he
stopped
dead
looks
good
to
me
he
said
and
it
was
good
they
stared
at
the
ramparts
growing
bolder
the
river
hurrying
like
a
the
steamer
feeling
its
way
slow
and
cautiously
like
a
blind
man
with
a
stick
seven
seven
seven
six
and
a
half
pitcairn
says
gold
is
always
thickest
on
the
inside
of
an
elbow
or
turn
in
the
stream
it
in
a
place
like
that
my
claim
is
the
steamer
swerved
still
further
out
from
the
course
indicated
on
the
chart
the
pilot
was
still
hunting
a
new
channel
but
still
the
captain
stood
and
listened
and
it
was
not
to
the
sounding
of
the
yukon
bar
they
say
there
no
doubt
about
the
whole
country
being
glaciated
hey
signs
of
glacial
erosion
everywhere
the
captain
looked
sharply
about
as
if
his
ship
might
be
in
some
new
danger
no
doubt
the
gold
is
all
concentrates
oh
is
that
so
he
seemed
relieved
on
the
whole
eight
and
a
half
from
below
eight
and
a
half
from
the
captain
eight
and
a
half
from
the
concentrates
eh
something
arresting
in
the
news
a
triple
essence
of
the
perfume
of
riches
with
the
incantation
of
technical
phrase
over
the
of
adventure
gambling
and
romance
that
simmers
in
the
mind
when
men
tell
of
finding
gold
in
the
ground
with
the
addition
of
this
salt
of
science
comes
a
savour
of
homely
virtue
an
aroma
promising
sustenance
and
strength
it
confounds
suspicion
and
sees
unbelief
first
weaken
and
at
last
do
reverence
there
is
something
hypnotic
in
the
terminology
enthusiasm
even
backed
by
fact
will
scare
off
your
practical
man
who
yet
will
turn
to
listen
to
the
theory
of
the
mechanics
of
erosion
and
one
of
its
proofs
up
there
before
our
eyes
the
striation
of
the
ramparts
but
rainey
was
what
he
called
an
old
bird
his
squinted
came
back
from
the
glacier
track
and
fell
on
the
outlandish
figure
of
his
passenger
and
with
an
inward
admiration
of
his
quality
of
extreme
the
captain
struggled
against
the
trance
did
i
hear
you
say
something
about
going
to
dawson
i
think
dawson
be
worth
seeing
holy
moses
yes
there
never
been
anything
like
dawson
before
and
i
want
to
talk
to
the
big
business
men
there
i
not
a
miner
myself
i
mean
to
put
my
property
on
the
market
as
he
said
the
words
it
occurred
to
him
unpleasantly
how
very
like
mcginty
they
sounded
but
he
went
on
i
did
dream
of
spending
so
much
time
up
here
as
put
in
already
i
got
to
get
back
to
the
states
you
had
any
proposition
yet
the
captain
led
the
way
to
his
private
room
about
my
claim
not
yet
but
once
i
get
it
on
the
market
so
full
was
he
of
a
scheme
of
his
own
he
failed
to
see
that
he
had
no
need
to
go
to
dawson
for
a
buyer
the
captain
set
out
drinks
and
still
the
talk
was
of
the
bar
it
had
come
now
to
seem
impossible
even
to
an
old
bird
that
given
those
exact
conditions
gold
should
not
be
gathered
thick
along
that
bar
i
regard
it
as
a
sure
thing
anyhow
it
recorded
and
the
assessment
done
all
the
district
wants
now
is
capital
to
develop
it
districts
like
that
all
over
the
map
said
the
old
bird
with
a
final
flutter
of
caution
even
if
the
capital
found
if
everything
ready
for
work
the
summer
damn
short
but
if
it
a
question
of
huntin
for
the
means
of
workin
there
time
returned
the
other
quietly
but
there
none
to
waste
you
take
me
and
my
pardner
thought
you
did
have
a
pardner
snapped
the
other
hot
over
such
duplicity
not
in
ownership
he
got
another
claim
but
you
take
my
pardner
and
me
to
dawson
the
captain
stood
on
his
legs
and
roared
i
ca
i
tell
you
you
can
if
you
will
you
will
if
you
want
that
farm
rainey
gaped
take
us
to
dawson
and
i
get
a
deed
drawn
up
in
min√≥ok
turning
over
of
my
idaho
bar
property
to
john
r
rainey
john
rainey
gaped
the
more
and
then
finding
his
tongue
no
no
i
just
as
soon
come
in
on
the
bar
but
it
true
what
tellin
you
there
simply
ai
an
unoccupied
inch
on
the
oklahoma
this
trip
it
been
somethin
awful
the
way
i
been
waylaid
and
prayed
at
for
a
passage
people
starvin
with
bags
o
money
waitin
for
at
the
dawson
bank
settlements
under
water
men
up
in
trees
callin
to
us
to
stop
for
the
love
of
god
men
in
boats
crossin
our
channel
us
off
thinkin
nothin
o
the
risk
o
bein
run
down
us
to
dawson
it
the
cry
for
fifteen
hundred
miles
oh
come
you
stopped
for
me
the
captain
smiled
shrewdly
i
did
think
it
necessary
at
the
time
to
explain
we
struck
bottom
just
then
new
channel
you
know
it
changes
a
lot
every
time
the
ice
goes
out
and
the
floods
come
down
i
reversed
our
engines
and
went
up
to
talk
to
the
pilot
we
backed
off
just
after
you
boarded
us
i
must
have
been
rattled
to
take
you
even
to
min√≥ok
no
it
was
the
best
turn
you
done
yourself
in
a
long
while
the
captain
shook
his
head
it
was
true
the
passengers
of
the
oklahoma
were
crowded
like
cattle
on
a
kansas
he
knew
he
ought
to
unload
and
let
a
good
portion
wait
at
min√≥ok
for
that
unknown
quantity
the
next
boat
he
would
issue
the
order
but
that
he
knew
it
would
mean
a
mutiny
i
get
into
trouble
for
overloading
as
it
is
you
probably
wo

whatever
the
captain
said

shriek
of
the
whistle
drowned
it
was
promptly
replied
to
by
the
most
horrible
howls
reckon
that
nig
he
got
to

said
this
dreadful
ragged
man
god

must
be

the
harassed
captain
hustled
out
you
must
wait
long
enough
here
to

that
deed
drawn
captain
called
out
the
other
as
he
flew
down
the
companionway
nearly
six
hundred
people
on
the
bank
suddenly
controlling
his
eagerness
the
boy
contented
himself
with
standing
back
and
staring
across
strange
shoulders
at
the
place
he
knew
so
well
there
was
the
shack
in
the
town
that
had
been
his
home
the
store
looming
importantly
the
gold
nugget
and
hardly
a
face
to
which
he
could
not
give
a
name
and
a
history
windy
jim
and
the
crippled
swede
bonsor
cheek
by
jowl
with
his
enemy
mcginty
judge
corey
spitting
straight
and
far
the
gorgeous
bartender
all
checks
and
diamonds
in
front
of
a
pitiful
group
of
the
thirty
of
them
in
the
town
waiting
for
rescue
by
the
steamer
butts
quite
bland
under
the
crooked
cottonwood
with
never
a
thought
of
how
near
he
had
come
on
that
very
spot
to
missing
the
first
boat
of
the
year
and
all
the
boats
of
all
the
years
to
follow
maudie
keith
and
the
colonel
stood
with
the
agent
at
the
end
of
the
that
led
to
the
landing
behind
them
at
least
four
hundred
people
packed
and
waiting
with
their
possessions
at
their
feet
ready
to
be
put
aboard
the
instant
the
oklahoma
made
fast
the
captain
had
called
out
howdy
to
the
agent
and
several
greetings
were
shouted
back
and
forth
maudie
mounted
a
huge
pile
of
baggage
and
sat
there
as
on
a
throne
the
colonel
and
keith
perching
on
a
heap
of
at
her
feet
that
woman
almost
the
only
person
in
sight
who
did
not
expect
by
means
of
the
oklahoma
to
leave
misery
behind
the
boy
stood
thinking
how
will
they
bear
it
when
they
know
the
oklahoma
was
late
but
she
was
not
only
the
first
boat
she
might
conceivably
be
the
last
potts
and
had
spotted
the
man
they
were
looking
for
and
called
out
hello
hello
as
the
big
fellow
on
the
pile
of
gunnies
got
up
and
waved
his
hat
mac
leaned
over
the
rail
saying
gruffly
that
you
colonel
trying
as
the
boss
of
the
big
chimney
saw
tryin
his
darndest
not
to
look
pleased
and
all
the
while
was
waving
his
hat
and
howling
with
excitement
how
the
gowld
how
yersilf
the
gangway
began
its
slow
swing
round
preparatory
to
lowering
into
place
the
mob
on
shore
caught
up
boxes
bundles
bags
and
pressed
forward
no
no
stand
back
ordered
the
captain
take
your
time
said
people
trembling
with
excitement
there
no
rush
there
no
room
called
out
the
purser
to
a
friend
no
room
went
from
mouth
to
mouth
incredulous
that
the
information
could
concern
the
speaker
he
was
only
one
there
was
certainly
room
for
him
and
every
man
pushed
the
harder
to
be
the
sole
exception
to
the
dreadful
verdict
stand
back
there
ca
take
even
a
pound
of
freight
loaded
to
the
guards
a
whirlwind
of
protest
and
appeal
died
away
in
curses
women
wept
and
sick
men
turned
away
their
faces
the
dogs
still
howled
for
nothing
is
so
lacerating
to
the
feelings
of
your
siwash
as
a
blast
the
memory
of
it
troubles
him
long
after
the
echo
of
it
dies
suddenly
above
the
din
maudie
shrill
voice
i
thought
that
was
nig
before
the
gangway
had
dropped
with
a
bang
her
sharp
eyes
had
picked
out
the
boy
well
i
be
see
who
that
is
behind
nig
trust
him
to
get
in
on
the
he
ai
worryin
for
fear
his
pardner
lose
the
boat
she
called
to
the
colonel
who
was
pressing
forward
as
rainey
came
down
the
gangway
how
do
you
do
captain
the
man
addressed
never
turned
his
head
he
was
forcing
his
way
through
the
jam
up
to
the
store
you
may
recall
me
sah
i
am
if
you
are
a
man
wantin
to
go
to
dawson
it
does
matter
who
you
are
i
ca
take
you
but
sah
it
was
no
use
a
dozen
more
were
pushing
their
claims
every
one
in
vain
the
oklahoma
passengers
bent
on
having
a
look
at
min√≥ok
crowded
after
the
captain
among
those
who
first
left
the
ship
the
boy
talking
to
the
purser
hard
upon
rainey
heels
the
colonel
stood
there
as
they
passed
the
captain
turning
back
to
say
something
to
the
boy
and
then
they
disappeared
together
through
the
door
of
the
never
a
word
for
his
pardner
not
so
much
as
a
look
bitterness
fell
upon
the
colonel
heart
maudie
called
to
him
and
he
went
back
to
his
seat
on
the
he
in
with
the
captain
now
she
said
he
got
no
more
use
for
us
but
there
was
less
disgust
than
triumph
in
her
face
was
walking
over
people
in
his
frantic
haste
to
reach
the
colonel
before
he
could
accomplish
his
design
he
had
three
separate
quarrels
on
his
hands
and
was
threatening
with
fury
to
settle
the
hash
of
several
of
his
dearest
new
friends
potts
meanwhile
was
shaking
the
big
chimney
boss
by
the
hand
and
saying
awfully
sorry
we
ca
take
you
on
with
us
adding
lower
we
had
a
mighty
mean
time
after
you
lit
out
then
mac
thrust
his
hand
in
between
the
two
and
gave
the
colonel
a
grip
that
made
the
kentuckian
eyes
water
kaviak
well
i
tell
you
he
shouldered
potts
out
of
his
way
and
while
the
talk
and
movement
went
on
all
round
maudie
throne
mac
ignoring
her
set
forth
grimly
how
after
an
awful
row
with
potts
he
had
adventured
with
kaviak
to
holy
cross
an
awful
row
indeed
thought
the
colonel
to
bring
mac
to
that
but
the
circumstances
had
little
interest
for
him
beside
the
fact
that
his
pardner
would
be
off
to
dawson
in
a
few
minutes
leaving
him
behind
and
caring
not
a
sou
markee
mac
was
still
at
holy
cross
he
had
seen
a
woman
there
calls
herself
a
nun
evidently
swallows
those
priests
whole
kind
of
mad
believes
it
all
except
for
that
good
sort
of
girl
the
kind
to
keep
her
word
and
she
had
promised
to
look
after
kaviak
and
never
let
him
away
from
her
till
mac
came
back
to
fetch
him
fetch
him
fetch
him
fetch
him
where
home
when
will
that
be
just
as
soon
as
i
put
through
the
job
up
yonder
he
jerked
his
head
up
the
river
indicating
the
common
goal
and
now
roaring
as
usual
had
broken
away
from
those
who
had
obstructed
his
progress
and
had
flung
himself
upon
the
colonel
when
the
excitement
had
calmed
down
a
little
well
said
the
colonel
to
the
three
ranged
in
front
of
him
maudie
looking
on
from
above
what
you

doin
all
these
three
months

well
a
oh

they
looked
at
one
another
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
and
then
they
looked
away
since
the
birds
came
began
mac
in
the
tone
of
one
who
wishes
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
och
yes
them
burruds
was
foine
potts
pulled
something
out
of
his
trousers
pocket
a
strange
collapsed
object
he
took
another
of
the
same
description
out
of
another
pocket
mac
hands
and
performed
the
same
action
each
man
seemed
to
have
his
pockets
full
of
these

swan
god

cahls

everybuddy

illegant
in
less
than
twenty
minutes
the
steamer
whistle
shrieked
nig
bounded
out
of
the
frantic
at
the
repetition
of
the
insult
other
dogs
took
the
quarrel
up
and
the
ramparts
rang
the
boy
followed
the
captain
out
of
the
store
all
the
motley
crew
that
had
swarmed
off
to
inspect
min√≥ok
swarmed
back
upon
the
oklahoma
the
boy
left
the
captain
this
time
and
came
briskly
over
to
his
friends
who
were
taking
leave
of
the
colonel
so
you
all
goin
on
but
me
said
the
colonel
very
sadly
the
colonel
pardner
stopped
short
and
looked
at
the
pile
of
baggage
got
your
stuff
all
ready
he
said
yes
the
answer
was
not
free
from
bitterness
i
have
the
pleasure
of
packin
it
back
to
the
shack
after
you
gone
so
you
were
all
ready
to
go
off
and
leave
me
said
the
boy
the
colonel
could
not
stoop
to
the
obvious
retort
his
pardner
came
round
the
pile
and
his
eyes
fell
on
their
common
the
two
nulato
rifles
and
other
traps
that
meant
more
to
him
than
any
objects
inanimate
in
all
the
world
what
you
were
goin
to
carry
off
my
things
too
exclaimed
the
boy
that
all
you
get
maudie
burst
out
indignantly
all
you
get
for
packin
his
stuff
down
to
the
landin
to
have
it
all
ready
for
him
and
worryin
yourself
into
for
fear
he

the
boat
mac
and
potts
condoled
with
the
colonel
while
the
fire
of
the
old
feud
flamed
and
died
yes
the
colonel
admitted
i
give
five
hundred
dollars
for
a
ticket
on
that
steamer
he
looked
in
each
of
the
three
faces
and
knew
the
vague
hope
behind
his
words
was
vain
but
the
boy
had
only
laughed
and
caught
up
the
baggage
as
the
last
whistle
set
the
rampart
echoes
flying
piping
like
a
lot
of
frightened
birds
come
along
then
look
here
the
colonel
burst
out
that
my
stuff

the
same

on
monday
morning
the
of
june
they
crossed
the
british
line
but
it
was
not
till
wednesday
the
at
four
in
the
afternoon
just
ten
months
after
leaving
san
francisco
that
the
oklahoma
passengers
saw
between
the
volcanic
hills
on
the
right
bank
of
the
yukon
a
stretch
of
boggy
tundra
whereon
hundreds
of
tents
gleamed
pink
and
saffron
just
beyond
the
bold
wooded
height
wearing
the
deep
scar
of
a
landslide
on
its
breast
just
round
that
bend
the
klondyke
river
joins
the
yukon
for
this
is
dawson
headquarters
of
the
richest
placer
diggings
the
world
has
seen
yet
wearing
more
the
air
of
a
great
army
encampment
for
two
miles
the
shines
with
sunlit
canvas
tents
tents
everywhere
as
far
as
eye
can
see
a
mushroom
growth
masking
the
older
cabins
the
swarms
with
craft
scows
and
canoes
birch
canvas
peterboro
the
great
bateaux
of
the
northern
lumberman
neat
little
skiffs
clumsy
rafts
heavy
from
green
timber
with
capacity
of
two
to
five
tons
lighters
and
barges
carrying
as
much
as
forty
tons
all
having
come
through
the
perils
of
the
upper
lakes
and
shot
the
canon
rapids
as
the
oklahoma
steams
nearer
the
town
blossoms
into
flags
a
great
murmur
increases
to
a
clamour
people
come
swarming
down
to
the
waving
union
jacks
and
stars
and
stripes
as
well
what
does
it
all
mean
a
cannon
booms
guns
are
fired
and
as
the
oklahoma
swings
into
the
bank
a
band
begins
to
play
a
cheer
goes
up
from
fifteen
thousand
throats
hurrah
for
the
first
steamer
the
oklahoma
has
opened
the
klondyke
season
of
they
got
their
effects
off
the
boat
and
pitched
the
old
tent
up
on
the
moosehide
then
followed
days
full
to
overflowing
breathless
fevered
yet
without
result
beyond
a
general
stringing
up
of
nerves
the
special
spell
of
dawson
was
upon
them
all
the
surface
aliveness
the
inner
deadness
the
sense
of
being
cut
off
from
all
the
rest
of
the
world
as
isolated
as
a
man
is
in
a
dream
with
no
past
no
future
only
a
fantastic
intensely
vivid
now
this
was
the
summer
climate
of
the
klondyke
the
colonel
the
boy
and
captain
rainey
maintained
the
illusion
of
prosecuting
their
affairs
by
frequenting
the
offices
stores
and
particularly
saloons
where
buyers
and
sellers
most
did
congregate
frequent
mention
was
made
of
a
certain
valuable
piece
of
property
where
was
it
down
yonder
at
min√≥ok
and
then
nobody
cared
a
straw
it
was
true
there
was
widespread
dissatisfaction
with
the
klondyke
everyone
agreed
it
had
been
overdone
it
would
support
of
the
people
already
here
and
tens
of
thousands
on
their
way
say
klondyke
and
instantly
your
soberest
man
goes
mad
say
anything
else
and
he
goes
deaf
min√≥ok
was
a
good
camp
but
it
had
the
disadvantage
of
lying
outside
the
magic
district
the
madness
would
of
course
not
last
but
meanwhile
the
time
went
by
and
the
people
poured
in
day
and
night
six
great
steamers
full
came
up
from
the
lower
river
and
still
the
small
craft
kept
on
flocking
like
coveys
of
through
the
upper
lakes
each
party
saying
the
crowd
is
behind
on
the
of
june
a
toy
whistle
sounded
shrill
above
the
town
and
in
puffed
a
liliputian
steamer
that
had
actually
come
on
her
own
through
the
canon
and
shot
the
white
horse
rapids
a
steamer
from
the
upper
river
after
that
others
two
were
wrecked
but
who
minded
and
still
the
people
pouring
in
and
still
that
cry
the
behind
and
still
the
clamour
for
quicker
ampler
means
of
transport
to
the
north
no
matter
what
it
cost
the
one
consideration
to
get
there
and
to
get
there
quickly
brought
most
of
the
horde
by
the
canadian
route
yet
as
against
the
two
ocean
steamers
the
year
before
to
meet
the
five
river
boats
at
michael
now
by
the
route
alone
twenty
ocean
steamers
and
river
boats
some
two
hundred
and
feet
long
and
every
one
crowded
to
the
guards
with
people
coming
to
the
klondyke
meanwhile
many
of
those
already
there
were
wondering
why
they
came
and
how
they
could
get
home
in
the
tons
of
mail
matter
for
dawson
stranded
at
skaguay
must
be
those
instructions
from
the
bank
at
home
to
the
canadian
bank
of
commerce
dawson
city
he
agreed
with
the
boy
that
if
very
soon
now
they
had
not
disposed
of
the
min√≥ok
property
they
would
go
to
the
mines
what
the
good
rasped
mac
every
foot
staked
for
seventy
miles
for
my
part
admitted
the
boy
i
less
grand
than
i
was
i
meant
to
make
some
poor
devil
dig
out
my
min√≥ok
gold
for
me
it
be
the
other
way
about
i
dig
gold
for
any
man
on
bonanza
that
pay
me
wages
they
sat
slapping
at
the
mosquitoes
till
a
whistle
screamed
on
the
lower
river
the
boy
called
to
nig
and
went
down
to
the
town
to
hear
the
news
mac
came
out
with
a
pack
and
said
he
be
back
in
a
day
or
two
after
he
had
disappeared
among
the
tents
a
conquering
army
that
had
forced
its
way
far
up
the
hill
by
now
the
colonel
got
up
and
went
to
the
spring
for
a
drink
he
stood
there
a
long
time
looking
out
wistfully
not
towards
the
common
magnet
across
the
klondyke
but
quite
in
the
other
direction
towards
the
nearer
gate
of
exit
towards

of

his

coming
briskly
up
the
slope
that

and
who

the

the
tent

and
he
went
on
poking
his
fun
till
suddenly
the
boy

high
spirits

did
she
see

well
she
seen
potts
anyhow
you
right
about
dawson
said
the
colonel
suddenly
it
too
rich
for
my
blood
they
pinned
a
piece
of
paper
on
the
to
say
they
were
gone
prospecting
future
movements
uncertain
each
with
a
small
pack
and
sticking
out
above
it
the
klondyke
shovel
that
had
come
all
the
way
from
san
francisco
nig
behind
with
provisions
in
his
little
and
tongue
farther
out
than
ever
they
turned
their
backs
on
dawson
crossed
the
lower
corner
of
lot
behind
the
government
reserve
stared
with
fresh
surprise
at
the
young
flourishing
there
down
to
the
klondyke
across
in
the
over
the
corduroy
that
cheers
and
deceives
the
for
that
first
mile
of
the
bonanza
trail
on
through
pool
and
morass
to
the
thicket
of
white
birches
where
the
colonel
thought
it
well
to
rest
awhile
yes
he
felt
the
heat
he
said
as
he
passed
the
time
of
day
with
other
men
going
by
with
packs
or
cursing
at
the
trail
and
at
the
government
that
taxed
the
miners
so
cruelly
and
then
did
nothing
for
them
not
even
making
a
decent
highway
to
the
dominion
source
of
revenue
but
out
of
the
direct
rays
of
the
sun
the
traveller
found
refreshment
and
the
mosquitoes
were
blown
away
by
the
keen
breeze
that
seemed
to
come
from
off
some
glacier
and
the
birds
sang
loud
and
the
starred
the
and
the
wove
a
tangle
on
either
side
the
swampy
trail
on
again
dipping
to
a
little
valley
bonanza
creek
they
stood
and
looked
well
here
we
are
yes
this
is
what
we
came
for
and
it
was
because
of
this
that
so
vast
a
machinery
of
ships
engines
and
complicated
human
lives
had
been
set
in
motion
what
was
it
a
dip
in
the
hills
where
a
little
stream
was
caught
up
into
sluices
on
either
side
of
every
line
of
boxes
heaps
and
windrows
of
gravel
above
high
on
staging
windlasses
stretching
away
on
either
side
gentle
slopes
mossed
and
flower
starred
here
and
there
upon
this
ancient
moose
pasture
tents
and
cabins
set
at
random
in
the
bed
of
the
creek
up
and
down
in
every
direction
squads
of
men
sweating
in
the
sun
here
where
for
untold
centuries
herds
of
leisurely
and
majestic
moose
had
come
to
quench
their
thirst
in
the
older
cabins
their
horns
still
lorded
it
their
bones
were
bleaching
in
the
on
from
claim
to
claim
the
to
these
rich
pastures
went
till
they
came
to
the
junction
of
the
el
dorado
where
huddles
the
haphazard
settlement
of
the
grand
forks
only
twelve
miles
from
dawson
and
now
they
were
at
the
heart
of
the
richest
placer
mining
district
the
world
has
seen
but
they
knew
well
enough
that
every
inch
was
owned
and
that
the
best
they
could
look
for
was
work
as
unskilled
labourers
day
shift
or
night
on
the
claims
of
luckier
men
they
had
brought
a
letter
from
ryan
of
the
mounted
police
to
the
superintendent
of
no
above
discovery
a
claim
a
little
this
side
of
the
forks
ryan
had
warned
them
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
scoville
austin
a
surly
person
naturally
so
exasperated
at
the
tax
and
so
enraged
at
the
rumour
of
government
spies
masquerading
as
workmen
checking
his
reports
that
he
was
a
man
to
avoid
but
seymour
the
superintendent
was
in
the
words
of
the
soothing
motto
of
the
whole
american
people
all
right
they
left
their
packs
just
inside
the
door
of
the
indicated
as
bunk
house
for
the
men
on
no
above
a
fearsome
place
where
on
shelf
above
shelf
among
long
unwashed
bedclothes
the
unwashed
workmen
of
a
prosperous
company
lay
in
the
stupor
of
sore
fatigue
and
someone
stirred
as
the
door
opened
and
out
of
the
fetid
dusk
of
the
unventilated
cabin
came
a
voice
night
shift
on
no
then
damn
you
shut
the
door
as
the
sun
forced
the
dawson
and
the
of
the
trail
so
here
on
the
creek
men
must
follow
the
strenuous
example
no
pause
in
the
growing
or
the
toiling
of
this
northern
world
the
on
no
was
hard
at
it
down
there
where
lengthwise
in
the
channel
was
propped
a
line
of
steadied
by
regularly
spaced
poles
laid
from
box
to
bank
on
gravel
ridge
looking
down
from
above
the
whole
was
like
a
huge
lying
along
the
bed
of
the
creek
a
little
group
of
men
with
picks
shovels
and
wheelbarrows
were
reducing
the
dump
of
winter
pay
piled
beside
a
windlass
conveying
it
to
the
sluices
other
men
in
line
four
or
five
feet
below
the
level
of
the
boxes
were
stripping
picking
and
shovelling
the
gravel
off
the
no
easy
business
for
even
this
summer
temperature
thawed
but
a
few
inches
a
day
and
below
the
frost
of
ten
thousand
years
cemented
the
rubble
into
iron
where
is
the
superintendent
that
seymour
in
the
straw
hat
it
was
felt
that
even
the
broken
and
dilapidated
article
mentioned
was
a
distinction
and
a
luxury
yes
it
was
too
hot
up
here
in
the
klondyke
they
made
their
way
to
the
man
in
authority
a
dark
person
with
big
gentle
eyes
not
the
sort
of
superintendent
they
had
expected
to
find
representing
such
a
man
as
the
owner
of
no
having
read
ryan
letter
and
slowly
scanned
the
applicants
what
do
you
know
about
it
he
nodded
at
the
sluice
all
of
nothing
said
the
boy
does
it
call
for
any
particular
knowing
asked
the
colonel
calls
for
muscle
and
plenty
of
his
voice
was
soft
but
as
the
colonel
looked
at
him
he
realized
why
a
hard
fellow
like
scoville
austin
had
made
this
southerner
superintendent
better
just
try
us
i
can
use
one
more
man
on
the
night
shift
a
dollar
and
a
half
an
hour
all
right
said
the
boy
the
colonel
looked
at
him
is
this
job
yours
or
mine
the
superintendent
had
gone
up
towards
the
dam
whichever
you
say
the
boy
did
not
like
to
suggest
that
the
colonel
seemed
little
fit
for
this
kind
of
exercise
they
had
been
in
the
klondyke
long
enough
to
know
that
to
be
in
work
was
to
be
in
luck
i
tell
you
the
younger
man
said
quickly
answering
something
unspoken
but
plain
in
the
colonel
face
i
go
up
the
gulch
and
see
what
else
there
is
it
crossed
his
mind
that
there
might
be
something
less
arduous
than
this
shovelling
in
the
wet
thaw
or
picking
at
frozen
gravel
in
the
hot
sun
if
so
the
colonel
might
be
induced
to
exchange
it
was
obvious
that
like
so
many
southerners
he
stood
the
sun
very
ill
while
they
were
agreeing
upon
a
rendezvous
the
superintendent
came
back
our
is
yonder
he
said
pointing
a
kind
of
sickness
came
over
the
kentuckian
as
he
recalled
the
place
he
turned
to
his
pardner
wish
we
got
a
and
brought
our
tent
out
from
dawson
then
apologetically
to
the
superintendent
you
see
sah
there
are
men
who
take
to
just
as
there
are
women
who
want
to
live
in
hotels
and
there
are
others
who
want
a
place
to
call
home
even
if
it
a
tent
the
superintendent
smiled
that
the
way
we
feel
about
it
in
alabama
he
reflected
an
instant
there
that
big
new
tent
up
there
on
the
hill
next
to
the
buckeyes
cabin
good
tent
belongs
to
a
couple
o
rich
englishmen
third
owners
in
no
gone
to
atlin
told
me
to
do
what
i
liked
with
that
tent
you
might
bunk
there
while
they
away
now
that
mighty
good
of
you
sah
next
whose
cabin
did
you
say
oh
i
do
know
their
names
they
have
a
lay
on
seventeen
ohio
men
they
called
buck
one
and
buck
two
anybody
show
you
to
the
buckeyes
and
he
turned
away
to
shout
gate
for
the
head
of
water
was
too
strong
and
he
strode
off
towards
the
lock
as
the
boy
tramped
about
looking
for
work
he
met
a
great
many
on
the
same
quest
it
seemed
as
if
the
colonel
had
secured
the
sole
job
on
the
creek
still
vacancies
might
occur
any
hour
in
the
big
new
tent
the
colonel
lay
asleep
on
a
little
mercifully
left
there
by
the
rich
englishmen
gettin
ready
for
the
as
he
stood
looking
down
upon
him
a
sudden
wave
of
pity
came
over
the
boy
he
knew
the
colonel
did
really
and
truly
have
to
do
this
kind
of
thing
he
just
did
like
givin
in
but
behind
all
that
there
was
a
sense
in
the
younger
mind
that
here
was
a
life
unlike
his
own
which
dimly
he
foresaw
was
to
find
its
legitimate
expression
in
battle
and
in
striving
here
in
the
person
of
the
colonel
no
soldier
but
a
serene
and
equable
soul
wrenched
out
of
its
proper
sphere
by
a
chance
hurt
to
a
woman
forsooth
an
imagination
so
stirred
that
if
it
slept
at
all
it
dreamed
and
moaned
in
its
sleep
as
now
a
conscience
wounded
and
refusing
to
heal
had
he
not
said
himself
that
he
had
come
up
here
to
forget
it
was
best
to
let
him
have
the
job
that
was
too
heavy
for
him
yes
it
was
best
after
all
and
so
they
lived
for
a
few
days
the
boy
chafing
and
wanting
to
move
on
the
colonel
very
earnest
to
have
him
stay
something
sure
to
turn
up
and
anyhow
letters
my
instruction
and
he
encouraged
the
acquaintance
the
boy
had
struck
up
with
the
buckeyes
hoping
against
hope
that
to
go
over
and
smoke
a
pipe
and
exchange
experiences
with
such
mighty
good
fellows
would
lighten
the
tedium
of
the
long
day
spent
looking
for
a
job
i
call
it
a
very
pleasant
cabin
the
colonel
would
say
as
he
lit
up
and
looked
about
anything
dismaller
it
would
be
hard
to
find
not
clean
and
shipshape
as
the
boy
kept
the
tent
but
with
double
army
blankets
nailed
over
the
single
window
it
was
blessedly
dark
if
stuffy
and
in
crying
need
of
cleaning
still
they
were
mighty
good
fellows
and
they
had
a
right
to
be
cheerful
up
there
on
the
rude
shelf
above
the
stove
was
a
row
of
old
brimful
of
bonanza
gold
there
they
stood
not
even
covered
dim
as
the
light
was
you
could
see
the
little
top
nuggets
peering
out
at
you
over
the
ragged
in
a
never
locked
shanty
never
molested
never
bothered
about
nearly
every
cabin
on
the
creek
had
similar
chimney
ornaments
but
not
everyone
boasted
an
old
coat
kept
under
the
bunk
full
of
the
bigger
sort
of
nuggets
the
colonel
was
always
ready
with
pretended
admiration
of
such
but
the
truth
was
he
cared
very
little
about
this
gold
he
had
come
so
far
to
find
his
own
wages
paid
in
dust
were
kept
in
a
the
boy
had
found
lyin
round
the
growing
store
shone
cheerfully
through
the
glass
but
its
value
in
the
colonel
eyes
seemed
to
be
simply
as
an
argument
to
prove
that
they
had
enough
and
need
worry
when
the
boy
said
there
was
no
doubt
this
was
the
district
in
all
the
world
the
most
overdone
the
colonel
looked
at
him
with
reproachful
eyes
you
want
to
dissolve
the
pardnership
i
see
i
do
but
the
colonel
after
any
such
interchange
would
go
off
and
smoke
by
himself
not
even
caring
for
buckeyes
the
work
was
plainly
overtaxing
him
he
slept
badly
was
growing
moody
and
quick
to
take
offence
one
day
when
he
had
been
distinctly
uncivil
he
apologized
for
himself
by
saying
that
standing
with
feet
always
in
the
wet
head
always
in
the
scorching
sun
he
had
taken
a
hell
of
a
cold
certain
it
was
that
without
sullenness
he
would
give
in
to
long
fits
of
silence
and
his
wide
honest
eyes
were
heavy
again
as
if
the
of
the
winter
had
its
analogue
in
a
summer
torment
from
the
sun
and
his
sometimes
unusual
gentleness
to
his
companion
was
sharply
alternated
with
unusual
choler
excited
by
a
mere
nothing
enough
if
the
boy
were
not
in
the
tent
when
the
colonel
came
and
went
of
course
the
boy
did
the
cooking
the
colonel
ate
almost
nothing
but
he
made
a
great
point
of
his
pardner
service
in
doing
the
cooking
he
would
starve
he
said
if
he
had
to
cook
for
himself
as
well
as
swing
a
shovel
and
the
boy
acting
on
pure
instinct
pretended
that
he
believed
this
was
so
then
came
the
evening
when
the
boy
was
so
late
the
colonel
got
his
own
breakfast
and
when
the
recreant
did
get
home
it
was
to
announce
that
a
man
over
at
the
buckeyes
had
just
offered
him
a
job
out
on
indian
river
the
colonel
set
down
his
and
stared
his
face
took
on
an
odd
rigid
look
but
almost
indifferently
he
said
so
you
goin
of
course
you
know
i
must
i
started
with
an
outfit
and
fifteen
hundred
dollars
now
i
have
a
cent
the
kentuckian
raised
his
heavy
eyes
to
the
oh
help
yourself
the
boy
laughed
and
shook
his
head
i
wish
you
would
go
the
other
said
very
low
you
see
i
got
to
why
nig
and
i
owe
you
for
a
week
grub
already
then
the
colonel
stood
up
and
swore
swore
till
he
was
scarlet
and
shaking
with
excitement
if
the
life
up
here
has
brought
us
to
austin
point
of
view
we
are
poorly
off
and
he
spoke
of
the
way
men
lived
in
his
part
of
kentucky
where
the
old
fashion
of
keeping
open
house
survived
and
did
he
know
it
was
the
same
thing
in
florida
would
you
do
as
much
for
me
yes
only
i
ca
and
i
restless
the
summer
half
gone
up
here
that
means
the
whole
year
half
gone
the
colonel
had
stumbled
back
into
his
seat
and
now
across
the
deal
table
he
put
out
his
hand
do
go
boy
i
do
know
how
i
get
on
without
he
stopped
and
his
big
hand
was
raised
as
if
to
brush
away
some
cloud
between
him
and
his
pardner
if
you
go
you
wo
come
back
oh
yes
i
will
you
see
i
know
the
kind
the
other
went
on
as
if
there
had
been
no
interruption
they
never
come
back
i
do
know
as
i
ever
cared
quite
as
much
for
my
brother
little
fella
that
died
you
know
then
seeing
that
his
companion
did
not
instantly
iterate
his
determination
to
go
that
right
he
said
getting
up
suddenly
and
leaving
his
breakfast
barely
touched
we
been
through
such
a
lot
together
let
see
it
out
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
went
off
to
his
favourite
seat
under
the
little
but
the
incident
had
left
him
nervous
he
would
come
up
from
his
work
almost
on
the
run
and
if
he
failed
to
find
his
pardner
in
the
tent
there
was
the
devil
to
pay
the
boy
would
laugh
to
himself
to
think
what
a
lot
he
seemed
able
to
stand
from
the
colonel
and
then
he
would
grow
grave
remembering
what
he
had
to
make
up
for
still
his
sense
of
obligation
did
not
extend
to
giving
up
this
splendid
chance
down
on
indian
river
on
wednesday
when
the
fellow
over
at
the
buckeyes
was
for
going
back
the
boy
would
go
along
on
sunday
morning
he
ran
a
crooked
rusty
nail
into
his
foot
clumsily
extracted
it
left
an
ugly
wound
walking
became
a
torture
and
the
pain
a
banisher
of
sleep
it
was
during
the
next
few
days
that
he
found
out
how
much
the
colonel
lay
awake
who
could
sleep
in
this
blazing
sun
black
tents
were
not
invented
then
so
they
lay
awake
and
talked
of
many
things
the
man
from
indian
river
went
back
alone
the
boy
would
limp
after
the
colonel
down
to
the
sluice
and
sit
on
a
dump
heap
with
nig
few
people
not
there
strictly
on
business
were
tolerated
on
no
but
nig
and
his
master
had
been
on
good
terms
with
seymour
from
the
first
now
they
struck
up
acquaintance
with
several
of
the
especially
with
the
men
who
worked
on
either
side
of
the
colonel
an
irish
gentleman
who
did
the
shovelling
just
below
said
he
had
graduated
from
dublin
university
he
certainly
had
been
educated
somewhere
and
if
the
discussion
were
theologic
would
take
out
of
his
pocket
a
little
testament
in
the
vulgate
to
verify
a
bit
of
gospel
he
could
even
pelt
the
man
next
but
one
in
his
native
tongue
calling
the
silesian
uebermensch
there
existed
some
doubt
whether
this
were
the
gentleman
real
name
but
none
at
all
as
to
his
talking
philosophy
with
greater
fervour
than
he
bestowed
on
the
puddling
box
the
others
were
men
more
accustomed
to
work
with
their
hands
but
in
spite
of
the
conscious
superiority
of
your
experienced
miner
a
very
good
feeling
prevailed
in
the
gang
a
general
friendliness
that
presently
centred
about
the
colonel
for
even
in
his
present
mood
he
was
far
from
disagreeable
except
now
and
then
to
the
man
he
cared
the
most
for
seymour
admitted
that
he
had
placed
the
southerner
where
he
thought
he
feel
most
at
home
anyhow
the
company
is
less
mixed
he
said
than
it
was
all
winter
up
at
where
they
had
a
presbyterian
missionary
down
the
shaft
a
salvation
army
captain
turnin
the
windlass
a
nigger
thief
dumpin
the
becket
and
a
dignitary
of
the
church
of
england
doin
the
cookin
with
the
help
of
a
chinese
they
all
there
now
except
one
washin
out
gold
for
the
couple
of
san
francisco
that
own
the
claim
vich
von
is
gone
asked
the
silesian
who
heard
the
end
of
the
conversation
oh
the
chinese
is
the
one
who
bettered
himself
said
the
superintendent
makin
more
than
all
the
others
put
together
ever
made
in
their
lives
runnin
a
laundry
up
at
dawson
the
boy
since
this
trouble
with
his
foot
had
fallen
into
the
way
of
turning
night
into
day
the
colonel
liked
to
have
him
down
there
at
the
sluice
and
when
he
thought
about
it
the
boy
marvelled
at
the
hours
he
spent
looking
on
while
others
worked
at
first
he
said
he
came
down
only
to
make
scowl
austin
mad
and
it
did
make
him
mad
at
first
but
the
odd
thing
was
he
got
over
it
and
used
to
stop
and
say
something
now
and
then
this
attention
on
the
part
of
the
owner
was
distinctly
perilous
to
the
boy
good
standing
with
the
gang
not
because
austin
was
the
owner
there
was
the
millionaire
swede
ole
olsen
any
man
might
talk
to
him
he
was
on
the
square
treated
his
workmen
mighty
fair
and
when
the
other
owners
tried
to
reduce
wages
and
did
ole
would
join
them
went
right
along
paying
the
highest
rate
on
the
creek
various
stories
were
afloat
about
austin
oh
yes
scowl
austin
was
a
hard
man
the
only
owner
on
the
creek
who
would
even
pay
the
little
subscription
every
poor
miner
contributed
to
keep
the
dawson
catholic
hospital
going
the
women
too
had
grievances
against
austin
not
only
the
usual
lot
up
at
the
gold
belt
who
sneered
at
his
close
fist
but
some
of
the
other
sort
those
few
wives
or
women
on
their
own
or
those
who
washed
and
cooked
for
this
claim
or
that
they
had
stories
about
austin
that
shed
a
lurid
light
and
so
by
degrees
the
gathered
experience
good
and
ill
of
the
greatest
of
all
placer
diggin
flowed
by
the
idler
on
the
bank
you
seem
to
have
a
lot
to
do
seymour
would
now
and
then
say
with
a
laugh
so
i
have
what
do
you
call
it
takin
stock
of
us
of
things
in
general
what
did
you
mean
by
that
demanded
the
colonel
suspiciously
when
the
superintendent
had
passed
up
the
line
the
shovelling
in
was
done
for
the
time
being
the
water
was
to
be
regulated
and
then
the
as
soon
as
the
owner
came
down
better
not
let
austin
hear
you
say
you
takin
stock
he
run
you
out
o
the
creek
the
boy
only
smiled
and
went
on
fillipping
little
stones
at
nig
what
did
you
mean
the
colonel
persisted
with
a
look
as
suspicious
as
scowl
austin
own
oh
nothin
i
only
thinkin
out
things
your
future
i
suppose
he
said
testily
mine
and
other
men
the
klondyke
a
great
place
to
get
things
clear
in
your
head
do
find
it
so
the
colonel
put
up
his
hand
with
that
now
familiar
action
as
if
to
clear
away
a
cloud
it
days
since
i
had
anything
clear
in
my
head
except
the
lesson
we
learned
on
the
trail
the
boy
stopped
throwing
stones
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
his
friend
as
the
colonel
went
on
we
had
that
hammered
into
us
did
we
what
oh
that
you
know
that
i
do
know
quite
how
to
put
it
so
sound
as
orthodox
as
it
might
be
bein
true
but
it
looks
pretty
clear
even
to
me
again
the
big
hand
brushing
at
the
unmoted
sunshine
that
the
only
reason
men
got
over
bein
beasts
was
because
they
began
to
be
brothers
do
said
the
boy
do
what
i
always
known
i
should
have
to
tell
you
some
time
i
wo
be
able
to
put
it
off
if
i
stay
and
i
hate
tellin
you
now
see
here
i
i
get
a
and
go
over
to
indian
river
the
colonel
looked
round
angrily
standing
high
against
the
sky
seymour
with
the
gateman
up
at
the
lock
was
moderating
the
strong
head
of
water
it
began
to
flow
sluggishly
over
the
riffles
and
scowl
austin
was
coming
down
the
hill
i
do
know
what
you
drivin
at
about
somethin
to
tell
i
know
one
thing
though
and
i
learned
it
up
here
in
the
north
men
were
meant
to
stick
to
one
another
do
i
say
here
austin
whispered
the
colonel
the
silesian
philosopher
stood
in
his
in
the
as
on
a
rostrum
but
silent
now
as
ever
when
scowl
austin
was
in
sight
with
the
great
the
philosopher
took
up
washed
and
threw
out
the
few
remaining
big
stones
that
they
might
not
clog
the
narrow
boxes
below
seymour
had
so
regulated
the
stream
that
in
place
of
the
gush
and
foam
of
a
few
minutes
before
there
was
now
only
a
scant
and
gently
falling
veil
of
water
playing
over
the
bright
gravel
caught
in
the
bottoms
of
the
boxes
as
the
boy
got
up
and
reached
for
his
stick
austin
stood
there
saying
to
nobody
in
particular
that
he
just
been
over
to
no
where
they
were
trying
a
riffle
do
your
riffles
do
the
trick
all
right
asked
the
boy
if
you
in
any
doubt
come
and
see
he
said
they
stood
together
leaning
over
the
sluice
looking
in
at
one
of
the
things
human
industry
has
failed
to
disfigure
nearly
as
beautiful
as
long
ago
on
pactolus
banks
when
lydian
shepherds
with
great
stones
fastened
fleeces
in
the
river
that
they
might
catch
and
gather
for
king
croesus
the
golden
sands
of
tmolus
improving
not
in
beauty
but
economy
quite
in
the
modern
spirit
the
greeks
themselves
discovered
that
they
lost
less
gold
if
they
led
the
stream
through
and
beyond
this
device
of
those
early
we
have
not
progressed
so
far
but
that
in
every
long
narrow
in
the
world
you
may
see
a
lydian
with
a
riffle
in
the
bottom
for
a
golden
fleece
the
rich
klondyker
and
the
poor
one
stood
together
looking
in
at
the
water
still
low
still
slipping
softly
over
polished
pebbles
catching
at
the
sunlight
winking
dimpling
glorifying
flint
and
jasper
agate
and
obsidian
dazzling
the
uncommercial
eye
to
blind
forgetfulness
of
the
magic
substance
underneath
austin
gathered
up
one
by
one
a
handful
of
the
shining
stones
and
tossed
them
out
then
bending
down
see
there
under
where
the
stones
had
been
neatly
caught
in
the
lattice
of
the
riffle
lying
thick
and
packed
by
the
water
action
a
heavy
ridge
of
black
and
yellow
magnetic
sand
and
gold
riffles
out
called
seymour
and
the
men
who
had
been
extracting
the
rusty
nails
that
held
them
firm
lifted
out
from
the
bottom
of
each
box
a
wooden
lattice
soused
it
gently
in
the
water
and
laid
it
on
the
bank
the
boy
had
turned
away
again
but
stood
an
instant
noticing
how
the
sun
caught
at
the
countless
particles
of
gold
still
clinging
to
the
wood
for
this
was
one
of
the
old
riffles
frayed
by
the
action
of
much
water
and
the
fret
of
many
stones
soon
it
would
have
to
be
burned
and
out
of
its
ashes
the
careful
austin
would
gather
up
with
mercury
all
those
million
points
of
light
meanwhile
seymour
had
called
to
the
gateman
for
more
water
and
himself
joining
the
gang
armed
now
with
flat
metal
scoops
they
all
began
to
turn
over
and
throw
back
against
the
stream
the
debris
in
the
bottom
of
the
boxes
giving
the
water
another
chance
to
wash
out
the
lighter
stuff
and
clean
the
gold
from
all
impurity
away
went
the
last
of
the
sand
and
away
went
the
pebbles
dark
or
bright
away
went
much
of
the
heavy
magnetic
iron
scowl
austin
at
the
end
of
the
line
had
a
with
which
he
swept
the
floor
of
the
box
always
upstream
gathering
the
contents
in
a
heap
now
on
this
side
now
on
that
letting
the
water
play
and
sort
and
carry
away
condensing
hastening
the
process
that
for
ages
had
been
concentrating
gold
in
the
arctic
placers
say
look
here
shouted
austin
to
the
boy
already
limping
up
the
hill
when
he
had
reached
the
sluice
again
he
found
that
all
scowl
austin
wanted
apparently
was
to
show
him
how
when
he
held
the
water
back
with
the
whisk
it
eddied
softly
at
each
side
of
the
broad
little
broom
leaving
exposed
the
pile
see
what
all
that
what
do
you
think
looks
like
a
heap
o
sawdust
austin
actually
laughed
see
if
it
feels
like
sawdust
take
it
up
like
this
he
ordered
his
visitor
obeyed
lifting
a
double
handful
out
of
the
water
and
holding
it
over
the
box
dripping
gleaming
the
most
beautiful
thing
that
comes
out
of
the
earth
save
only
life
and
the
assertion
may
stand
even
if
the
distinction
is
without
difference
if
the
crystal
is
born
grows
old
and
dies
as
undeniably
as
the
rose
the
boy
held
the
double
handful
of
gold
up
to
the
sunshine
feeling
to
the
full
the
immemorial
spell
cast
by
the
king
of
metals
nothing
that
men
had
ever
made
out
of
gold
was
so
entirely
beautiful
as
this
scowl
austin
grim
gratification
was
openly
heightened
with
the
rich
man
sense
of
superiority
but
his
visitor
seemed
to
have
forgotten
him
colonel
here
a
minute
we
thought
it
looked
wonderful
enough
on
the
big
chimney
table
but
lord
to
see
it
like
this
out
o
doors
mixed
with
sunshine
and
water
still
he
stood
there
fascinated
leaning
heavily
against
the
still
with
his
dripping
hands
full
when
after
a
hurried
glance
the
colonel
returned
to
his
own
box
none
of
the
gang
ever
talked
in
the
presence
of
the
owner
guess
that
looks
good
to
you
austin
slightly
stressed
the
pronoun
he
had
taken
a
reasonless
liking
for
the
young
man
who
from
the
first
had
smiled
into
his
frowning
face
and
treated
him
as
he
treated
others
or
perhaps
austin
liked
him
because
although
the
boy
did
a
good
deal
of
gassin
with
the
gang
he
had
never
hung
about
at
at
all
events
he
should
stay
partly
because
when
the
blue
devils
were
down
on
scowl
austin
nothing
cheered
him
like
showing
his
luck
off
to
someone
and
it
was
so
seldom
safe
in
these
days
people
talked
the
authorities
conceived
unjust
suspicions
of
a
man
returns
and
then
far
back
in
his
head
that
vague
need
men
feel
when
a
good
thing
has
lost
its
early
zest
to
see
its
dimmed
value
shine
again
in
an
envious
eye
here
was
a
young
fellow
who
before
he
went
lame
had
been
all
up
and
down
the
creek
for
days
looking
for
a
job
probably
had
a
penny
livin
off
his
friend
who
himself
would
starve
but
for
the
privilege
austin
gave
him
of
washing
out
austin
gold
let
the
young
man
stop
and
see
the
richest
at
the
forks
and
so
it
was
with
the
acrid
pleasure
he
had
promised
himself
that
he
said
to
the
visitor
bending
over
the
double
handful
of
gold
guess
it
looks
good
to
you
yes
it
looks
good
but
he
had
lifted
his
eyes
and
seemed
to
be
studying
the
man
more
than
the
metal
a
couple
of
newcomers
going
by
halted
christ
said
the
younger
look
at
that
the
boy
remembered
them
they
had
been
to
seymour
only
a
couple
of
hours
before
asking
for
work
one
was
old
for
that
country
nearly
sixty
and
looked
as
one
of
the
gang
had
said
as
if
instid
findin
the
pot
o
gold
he
had
got
the
end
of
the
rainbow
slam
in
his
face
kind
o
blinded
at
sound
of
the
strange
voice
austin
had
wheeled
about
with
a
fierce
look
and
heavily
the
strangers
plodded
by
the
owner
turned
again
to
the
gold
yes
he
said
curtly
there
something
about
that
that
looks
good
to
most
men
what
i
was
thinkin
replied
the
boy
slowly
was
that
it
was
the
only
clean
gold
i
ever
seen
but
it
is
so
clean
as
it
was
what
do
you
mean
austin
bent
and
looked
sharply
into
the
full
hands
i
was
thinkin
it
was
good
to
look
at
because
it
had
got
into
dirty
pockets
yet
austin
stared
at
him
an
instant
never
been
passed
round
never
bought
anybody
no
one
had
ever
envied
it
or
refused
it
to
help
someone
out
of
a
hole
that
was
why
i
thought
it
looked
good
because
it
was
clean
gold
a
little
while
ago
and
he
plunged
his
hands
in
the
water
and
washed
the
clinging
particles
off
his
fingers
austin
had
stared
and
then
turned
his
back
with
a
blacker
look
than
even
scowl
had
ever
worn
before
gosh
guess
there
goin
to
be
trouble
said
one
of
the
gang
chapter
xxi
pardners
he
saw
and
first
of
brotherhood
had
sight
it
was
morning
and
the
might
go
to
bed
but
in
the
absent
englishmen
tent
there
was
little
sleep
and
less
talk
that
day
the
boy
in
an
agony
with
a
foot
on
fire
heard
the
colonel
turning
tossing
growling
incoherently
about
the
light
it
seemed
unreasonable
for
a
frame
had
been
built
round
his
bed
and
on
it
thick
gray
army
blankets
were
nailed
a
rectangular
tent
had
he
cursed
the
heat
now
but
no
light
god
the
light
the
light
just
as
if
he
were
lying
as
the
boy
was
in
the
strong
white
glare
of
the
tent
but
hour
after
hour
within
the
stifling
fortress
the
giant
tossed
and
muttered
at
the
swords
of
sunshine
that
pierced
his
through
little
hole
or
torturing
sensitive
eyes
near
three
hours
before
he
needed
the
colonel
got
up
and
splashed
his
way
through
a
toilet
at
the
tin
basin
the
boy
made
breakfast
without
waiting
for
the
usual
hour
they
had
nearly
finished
when
it
occurred
to
the
colonel
that
neither
had
spoken
since
they
went
to
bed
he
glanced
across
at
the
absorbed
face
of
his
friend
you
come
down
to
the
sluice
wo
you
why
should
i
no
reason
on
earth
only
i
was
afraid
you
were
broodin
over
what
you
said
to
austin
austin
oh
i
not
thinkin
about
austin
what
then
what
makes
you
so
quiet
well
i
thinkin
i
be
better
satisfied
to
stay
here
a
little
longer
if
if
what
if
there
was
truth
between
us
two
i
thought
there
was
no
what
the
reason
you
want
me
to
stay
here
reason
why
he
laughed
in
his
old
way
i
do
defend
my
taste
but
i
kind
o
like
to
have
you
round
his
companion
grave
face
showed
no
lightening
why
do
you
want
me
round
more
than
someone
else
have
got
anyone
else
oh
yes
you
have
every
man
on
bonanza
a
friend
o
yours
or
would
be
it
is
just
that
we
understand
each
other
no
we
do
what
wrong
no
answer
the
boy
looked
through
the
door
across
bonanza
to
the
hills
i
thought
we
understood
each
other
if
two
men
ever
did
have
we
travelled
the
long
trail
together
and
seen
the
ice
go
out
that
just
it
colonel
we
know
such
a
lot
more
than
men
do
who
have
travelled
the
trail
and
some
of
the
knowledge
oversweet
a
shadow
crossed
the
kind
face
opposite
you
thinkin
about
the
times
i
pegged
out
did
do
my
share
lord
no
the
tears
sprang
up
in
the
young
eyes
i
thinkin
o
the
times
i
he
laid
his
head
down
on
the
rude
table
and
sat
so
for
an
instant
with
hidden
face
then
he
straightened
up
seems
as
if
only
lately
there
been
time
to
think
it
out
and
before
as
long
as
i
could
work
i
could
get
on
with
myself
seemed
as
if
i
stood
a
chance
to
a
little
to
make
up
make
up
but
it
always
just
as
it
was
that
day
on
the
oklahoma
when
the
captain
swore
he
would
take
on
another
pound
i
was
awfully
happy
thinkin
if
i
made
him
bring
you
it
might
kind
o
make
up
but
it
did
made
a
big
difference
to
me
the
colonel
said
still
not
able
to
see
the
drift
but
patiently
brushing
now
and
then
at
the
dazzling
mist
and
waiting
for
enlightenment
it
always
the
same
the
other
went
on
whenever
i
come
up
against
something
i
hoped
was
goin
to
make
up
it
turned
out
to
be
a
thing
i
have
to
do
anyway
and
there
was
no
make
up
about
it
for
all
that
i
should
mind
stayin
on
awhile
since
you
want
me
to
the
colonel
interrupted
him
that
right
only
if
i
do
you
got
to
know
what
i
never
have
guessed
myself
but
for
the
trail
after
i
told
you
if
you
can
bear
to
see
me
round
he
hesitated
and
suddenly
stood
up
his
eyes
still
wet
but
his
head
so
high
an
onlooker
who
did
not
understand
english
would
have
called
the
governing
impulse
pride
defiance
even
it
seems
i
the
kind
of
man
colonel
the
kind
of
man
who
could
leave
his
pardner
to
die
like
a
dog
in
the
snow
if
any
other
fella
said
so
i
knock
him
down
that
night
before
we
got
to
snow
camp
when
you
would
could
go
any
farther
i
meant
to
go
and
leave
you
take
the
sled
and
take
i
guess
i
meant
to
take
everything
and
leave
you
to
starve
they
looked
into
each
other
faces
and
years
seemed
to
go
by
the
colonel
was
the
first
to
drop
his
eyes
but
the
other
pitilessly
like
a
judge
arraigning
a
felon
his
steady
scrutiny
never
flinching
do
you
want
that
kind
of
a
man
round
colonel
the
kentuckian
turned
quickly
as
if
to
avoid
the
stab
of
the
eye
and
sat
hunched
together
elbows
on
knees
head
in
hands
i
knew
you
did
the
boy
answered
his
own
question
he
limped
over
to
his
side
of
the
tent
picked
up
some
clothes
his
blanket
and
few
belongings
and
made
a
pack
not
a
word
not
a
sound
but
some
birds
twittering
outside
in
the
sun
and
a
locust
making
that
frying
sound
in
the
the
pack
was
slung
on
the
boy
back
and
he
was
throwing
the
diamond
hitch
to
fasten
it
when
the
colonel
at
last
looked
round
lord
what
you
doin
guess
i
goin
on
where
i
write
you
when
i
know
maybe
i
even
send
you
what
i
owe
you
but
i
do
feel
like
boastin
at
the
moment
nig
you
ca
walk
did
you
never
happen
to
notice
that
fella
pluggin
about
dawson
he
had
gone
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
to
see
if
nig
was
asleep
under
the
the
colonel
got
up
went
to
the
door
and
let
down
the
flap
when
he
turned
the
traveller
and
the
dog
were
at
his
elbow
he
squared
his
big
frame
at
the
entrance
looking
down
at
the
two
tried
to
speak
but
the
boy
broke
in
do
let
get
sentimental
colonel
just
stand
aside
never
stirring
he
found
a
voice
to
say
i
not
askin
you
to
stay
the
other
turned
and
whistled
for
nig
had
retired
again
to
the
seclusion
of
the
gray
blanket
screen
i
only
want
to
tell
you
something
before
you
go
the
boy
frowned
a
little
but
rested
his
pack
against
the
table
in
that
way
in
which
the
klondyker
learns
to
make
a
of
his
burden
you
seem
to
think
you
been
tellin
me
news
said
the
colonel
when
you
said
that
about
goin
on
the
night
before
we
got
to
snow
camp
i
knew
you
simply
meant
you
still
intended
to
come
out
alive
i
had
thrown
up
my
hands
at
least
i
thought
i
had
the
only
difference
between
us
i
had
given
in
and
you
had
the
other
shook
his
head
there
was
a
lot
more
in
it
than
that
you
meant
to
take
the
only
means
there
were
to
carry
off
the
sled
that
i
could
pull
any
farther
the
boy
looked
up
quickly
something
stern
and
in
the
dark
face
forced
the
colonel
to
add
and
along
with
the
sled
you
meant
to
carry
off
the
the
things
that
meant
life
to
us
just
that
the
boy
knotted
his
brown
fingers
in
nig
hair
as
if
to
keep
tight
hold
of
one
friend
in
the
wreck
we
could
divide
the
colonel
hurried
on
it
was
a
case
of
crawlin
on
together
and
maybe
come
out
alive
or
part
and
one
die
sure
the
boy
nodded
tightening
his
lips
i
knew
well
enough
you
fight
for
the
but
the
colonel
came
away
from
the
door
and
stood
in
front
of
his
companion
so
would
i
had
really
given
up
the
struggle
you
were
past
strugglin
and
i
would
have
left
you
sick
you
would
have
left
me
if
i
had
my
gun
the
boy
remembered
that
he
had
more
than
suspected
that
at
the
time
but
the
impression
had
waxed
dim
it
was
too
utterly
unlike
the
colonel
a
thing
dreamed
he
had
grown
as
ashamed
of
the
dream
as
of
the
thing
he
knew
was
true
the
egotism
of
memory
absorbed
itself
in
the
part
he
himself
had
played
that
other
an
evil
fancy
born
of
an
evil
time
and
here
was
the
colonel
saying
it
was
true
the
boy
dropped
his
eyes
it
had
all
happened
in
the
night
there
was
something
in
the
naked
truth
too
ghastly
for
the
day
but
the
colonel
went
on
in
a
harsh
whisper
i
looked
round
for
my
gun
if
i
found
it
i
have
left
you
behind
and
the
boy
kept
looking
down
at
nig
and
the
birds
sang
and
the
locust
whirred
and
the
hot
sun
filled
the
tent
as
flushes
a
you
been
a
little
hard
on
me
boy
bringin
it
up
like
this
remindin
me
i
would
have
gone
on
myself
and
makin
me
admit
no
no
colonel
makin
me
admit
that
before
i
would
have
let
you
go
on
i
have
shot
you
colonel
he
loosed
his
hold
of
nig
i
rather
reckon
i
owe
you
my
life
and
something
else
besides
the
colonel
laid
one
hand
on
the
thin
shoulder
where
the
pressed
and
closed
the
other
hand
tight
over
his
pardner
right
and
i
had
meant
even
to
thank
you
neither
do
for
the
lord
sake
do
said
the
younger
and
neither
dared
look
at
the
other
a
scratching
on
the
canvas
the
northern
knock
at
the
door
you
fellers
sound
awake
a
woman
voice
under
his
breath
who
the
devil
that
inquired
the
colonel
brushing
his
hand
over
his
eyes
before
he
got
across
the
tent
maudie
had
pushed
the
flap
aside
and
put
in
her
head
hello
how
do
he
shook
hands
and
the
younger
man
nodded
hello
when
did
you
come
to
town
asked
the
colonel
mendaciously
why
nearly
three
weeks
ago
on
the
weare
heard
you
had
skipped
out
to
sulphur
with
maccann

had
some

the
boy
slipped
off
his
pack
they
got
rooms
at
the
gold
belt
he
said
you
mean
that
dance
hall
up
at
the
forks

he
laughed
and
went
to
the
entrance
to
tic
back
the
which
was
whipping
and
snapping
in
the
breeze
heaven
be
praised
the
night
was
cooler
nig
had
been
perplexed
when
he
saw
the
pack
pushed
under
the
table
he
followed
his
master
to
the
door
and
stood
looking
at
the
ears
very
pointed
critical
eye
cocked
asking
as
plain
as
could
be
you
wake
me
up
and
drag
me
out
here
into
the
heat
and
mosquitoes
just
to
watch

that
well

my
opinion
of
you
colonel
gone
down
inquired
the
silesian
passing
by
not
yet
anything
i
can
do
the
gentleman
inside
was
saying
with
a
sound
of
effort
in
his
voice
the
lady
was
not
even
at
the
pains
to
notice
the
perfunctory
civility
well
colonel

o

klondyke

the
boom
busted
well
no
has
tax
begun
it
too
many
cheechalkos
are
finishing
it
klondyke
she
laughed
the
klondyke
goin
to
hell
in
a
scowl
austin
was
up
ready
as
usual
to
relieve
seymour
of
half
the
superintending
but
never
letting
him
off
duty
till
he
had
seen
the
new
shift
at
work
as
the
boy
limped
by
with
the
german
austin
turned
his
scowl
significantly
towards
the
colonel
tent
i
mean
laughed
the
lame
man
just
as
if
his
tongue
had
not
run
away
with
him
the
last
time
the
two
had
met
it
was
not
often
that
anyone
spoke
so
pleasantly
to
the
owner
of
no
perhaps
the
circumstance
weighed
with
him
at
all
events
he
stopped
short
when
the
german
had
gone
on
foot
better
austin
asserted
perhaps
it
is
a
little
though
the
lame
man
had
no
reason
to
think
so
lucky
you
heal
quick
most
people
do
up
here
livin
on
the
stale
stuff
we
get
in
this
country
seymour
said
anything
to
you
about
a
job
no
well
since
you
on
time
you
better
come
on
the
night
shift
instead
o
that
lazy
friend
o
yours
oh
he
ai
lazy
been
up
hours
an
old
acquaintance
dropped
in
he
be
down
in
a
minute
is
only
his
bein
late
you

on
the
shift
do
think
i
could
do
that
what
the
matter
do
say
there
anything
very
much
the
matter
yet
but
he
sick
ai
he
sick
no
except
as
we
all
are
sick
o
the
eternal
glare
the
colonel
was
coming
slowly
down
the
hill
of
course
a
man
look
his
best
if
he
has
slept
the
boy
limped
a
little
way
back
to
meet
him
anything
the
matter
with
you
colonel
well
my
bonanza
headache
ai
improved
i
suppose
you
wouldn
like
me
to
take
over
the
job
for
two
or
three
days
you
crippled
look
here
the
colonel
flushed
suddenly
austin
been
sayin
anything
oh
i
was
just
thinkin
about
the
sun
well
when
i
want
to
go
in
out
of
the
sun
i
say
so
and
walking
more
quickly
than
he
had
done
for
long
he
left
his
companion
marched
down
to
the
creek
and
took
his
place
near
the
by
the
time
the
boy
got
to
the
little
patch
of
shade
offered
by
the
staging
austin
had
turned
his
back
on
the
gang
and
was
going
to
speak
to
the
gateman
at
the
locks
he
had
evidently
left
the
colonel
very
much
enraged
at
some
curt
comment
he
meant
it
for
us
all
the
dublin
gentleman
was
saying
soothingly
as
they
worked
undisturbed
serenity
returned
oh
the
colonel
was
all
right
even
more
chipper
than
usual
what
a
fella
he
was
with
that
clear
skin
and
splendid
colour
a
couple
of
hours
later
the
colonel
set
his
long
shovel
against
the
nearest
of
the
poles
steadying
the
sluice
and
went
over
to
the
staging
for
a
drink
he
lifted
the
can
of
weak
tea
to
his
lips
and
took
a
long
draught
handed
the
can
back
to
the
boy
and
leant
against
the
staging
they
talked
a
minute
or
two
in
undertones
a
curt
voice
behind
said
looks
like
you
got
a
deal
to
attend
to
beside
your
work
they
looked
round
and
there
was
austin
as
the
colonel
saw
who
it
was
had
spoken
the
clear
colour
in
the
tan
deepened
he
threw
back
his
shoulders
hesitated
and
then
without
a
word
went
and
took
up
his
shovel
austin
walked
on
the
boy
kept
looking
at
his
friend
what
was
the
matter
with
the
colonel
it
was
not
only
that
his
eyes
were
queer
most
of
the
men
complained
of
their
eyes
unless
they
slept
in
cabins
but
whether
through
or
shaken
by
anger
the
colonel
was
handling
his
shovel
uncertainly
fumbling
at
the
gravel
content
with
half
a
shovelful
and
sometimes
gauging
the
distance
to
the
box
so
badly
that
some
of
the
pay
fell
down
again
in
the
creek
as
austin
came
back
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
he
stopped
opposite
to
where
the
colonel
worked
and
suddenly
called
seymour
like
so
many
on
bonanza
the
superintendent
could
not
always
sleep
when
the
time
came
he
was
walking
about
showing
things
to
a
stranger
a
newspaper
woman
it
was
whispered
at
all
events
a
lady
who
armed
with
letters
from
the
highest
british
officials
had
come
to
write
up
the
klondyke
seymour
had
left
her
at
his
employer
call
the
lady
thin
neat
alert
with
crisply
curling
hair
and
pleasant
but
unmistakably
dignified
expression
stood
waiting
for
him
a
moment
on
the
heap
of
tailings
then
innocently
followed
her
guide
although
austin
lowered
his
voice
she
drew
nearer
prepared
to
take
an
intelligent
interest
in
the
new
riffles
up
on
skookum
when
austin
had
first
called
seymour
the
colonel
started
looked
up
and
watched
the
little
scene
with
suspicion
and
growing
anger
seeing
seymour
eyes
turn
his
way
the
kentuckian
stopped
shovelling
and
on
a
sudden
impulse
called
out
see
here
austin
if
you
any
complaints
to
make
sah
you
better
make
them
to
my
face
sah
the
conversation
about
riffles
thus
further
interrupted
a
little
silence
fell
the
superintendent
stood
in
evident
fear
of
his
employer
but
he
hastened
to
speak
conciliatory
words
no
complaint
at
all
one
of
the
best
hands
may
be
so
when
he
ai
sick
said
austin
contemptuously
sick
the
boy
called
out
why
you
dreamin
he
our
strong
man
able
to
knock
spots
out
of
anyone
on
the
creek
ai
he
appealing
to
the
gang
i
shall
be
able
to
spare
him
from
my
part
of
the
creek
after
do
i
understand
you
are
dismissing
me
oh
go
to
hell
the
colonel
dropped
his
shovel
and
clenched
his
hands
get
the
woman
out
o
the
way
said
the
owner
there
goin
to
be
trouble
with
this
southerner
the
woman
turned
quickly
the
colonel
diving
under
the
for
a
plunge
at
austin
came
up
face
to
face
with
her
the
lady
said
the
colonel
catching
his
breath
shaking
with
rage
but
pulling
off
his
hat
the
lady
is
quite
safe
but
i
not
so
sure
about
you
he
swerved
as
if
to
get
by
safe
i
should
think
so
she
said
steadily
comprehending
all
at
once
and
not
unwilling
to
create
a
diversion
this
is
no
place
for
a
woman
not
if
she
got
twenty
letters
from
the
gold
commissioner
misunderstanding
austin
jibe
at
the
official
the
lady
stood
her
ground
smiling
into
the
face
of
the
excited
kentuckian
several
people
have
asked
me
if
i
was
not
afraid
to
be
alone
here
and
i
said
no
it
quite
true
i
travelled
so
much
that
i
came
to
know
years
ago
it
not
among
men
like
you
a
woman
has
anything
to
fear
it
was
funny
and
pathetic
to
see
the
infuriate
colonel
clutching
at
his
grand
manner
bowing
one
instant
to
the
lady
shooting
death
and
damnation
the
next
out
of
heavy
eyes
at
austin
but
the
wiry
little
woman
had
the
floor
and
meant
for
peace
sake
to
keep
it
a
few
moments
at
home
in
the
streets
of
london
i
have
been
rudely
spoken
to
i
have
been
greatly
annoyed
in
paris
in
new
york
i
have
been
subject
to
humorous
impertinence
but
in
the
great
every
man
has
seemed
to
be
my
friend
in
fact
wherever
our
english
tongue
is
spoken
she
wound
up
calmly
putting
the
great
austin
in
his
place
a
woman
may
go
alone
austin
seemed
absorbed
in
filling
his
pipe
the
lady
tripped
on
to
the
next
claim
with
a
sedate
to
the
men
on
no
she
thought
the
momentary
trouble
past
and
never
turned
to
see
how
the
kentuckian
waiting
till
she
should
be
out
of
earshot
came
round
in
front
of
austin
with
a
low
question
the
gang
watched
the
boy
dodge
under
the
sluice
and
hobble
hurriedly
over
the
chaos
of
stones
towards
the
owner
before
he
reached
him
he
called
breathless
but
trying
to
laugh
you
think
the
colonel
played
out
but
take
my
word
for
it
he
a
man
to
fool
with
the
gang
knew
from
austin
sneering
look
as
he
turned
to
strike
a
match
on
a
boulder
they
knew
as
well
as
if
they
been
within
a
yard
of
him
that
scowl
had
said
something
pretty
mean
they
saw
the
colonel
make
a
plunge
and
they
saw
him
reel
and
fall
among
the
stones
the
owner
stood
there
smoking
while
the
night
gang
knocked
off
work
under
his
nose
and
helped
the
boy
to
get
the
colonel
on
his
feet
it
was
no
use
either
he
had
struck
his
head
or
he
was
dazed
unable
at
all
events
to
stand
they
lifted
him
up
and
started
for
the
big
tent
three
indians
accosted
the
cripple
leading
the
procession
he
started
and
raised
his
eyes
nicholas
muckluck
they
shook
hands
and
all
went
on
together
the
boy
saying
the
colonel
had
a
little
sunstroke
the
next
day
scowl
austin
was
found
lying
face
down
among
the
above
the
benches
on
skookum
a
in
his
back
he
had
fainted
from
loss
of
blood
when
he
was
picked
up
by
the
two
vermonters
the
men
who
had
twice
gone
by
no
the
night
before
the
quarrel
and
who
had
enraged
austin
by
stopping
an
instant
during
the
to
look
at
his
gold
they
carried
him
back
to
bonanza
the
superintendent
and
several
of
the
day
gang
got
the
wounded
man
into
bed
he
revived
sufficiently
to
say
he
had
not
seen
the
man
that
shot
him
but
he
guessed
he
knew
him
all
the
same
then
he
turned
on
his
side
swore
feebly
at
the
lawlessness
of
the
south
and
gave
up
the
ghost
not
a
man
on
the
creek
but
understood
who
scowl
austin
meant
them
kentuckians
y
know
they
dowse
a
feller
glim
for
less
that
little
doubt
the
colonel
done
it
all
right
why
his
own
pardner
says
to
austin
face
says
he
colonel
a
bad
man
to
fool
with
and
just
then
the
big
chap
plunged
at
austin
like
a
mad
bull
but
they
were
sorry
to
a
man
and
said
among
themselves
that
they
see
he
was
defended
proper
even
if
he
had
nothin
but
a
little
dust
in
a
the
grand
forks
constable
had
put
a
watch
on
the
big
tent
despatched
a
man
to
inform
the
dawson
chief
of
police
and
set
himself
to
learn
the
details
of
the
quarrel
meanwhile
the
utter
absence
of
life
in
the
guarded
tent
roused
suspicion
it
was
recalled
now
that
since
the
indians
had
left
a
little
while
after
the
colonel
was
carried
home
sixteen
hours
ago
no
one
had
seen
either
of
the
southerners
the
constable
taking
alarm
at
this
left
the
crowd
at
scowl
austin
and
went
hurriedly
across
the
meadow
to
the
new
centre
of
interest
just
as
he
reached
the
tent
the
flap
was
turned
back
and
maudie
put
her
head
out
hah
said
the
constable
with
some
relief
they
both
in
there
the
colonel
is
now
it
was
the
colonel
he
had
wanted
till
he
heard
he
was
there
as
the
woman
came
out
he
looked
in
to
make
certain
yes
there
he
was
calmly
sleeping
with
the
gray
blanket
of
the
screen
thrown
up
for
air
it
did
look
much
like
where
the
other
feller
gone
to
dawson
with
that
lame
leg
went
on
horseback
it
had
as
grand
a
sound
as
it
would
have
in
the
states
to
say
a
man
had
departed
in
a
glass
coach
drawn
by
six
horses
but
he
had
been
in
a
hell
of
a
hurry
evidently
men
were
exchanging
glances
funny
nobody
saw
him
when
he
light
out
about
five
this
morning
oh
that
explained
it
the
people
who
were
up
at
five
were
abed
now
and
the
group
round
the
tent
whispered
that
austin
had
done
the
unheard
of
had
gone
off
and
left
the
night
gang
at
three
in
the
morning
they
had
said
so
as
the
day
shift
turned
out
but
how
the
young
feller
get
such
a
thing
as
a
horse
hired
it
off
a
stranger
out
from
dawson
yesterday
maudie
answered
shortly
oh
that
frenchman
count
a
whirligig
but
maudie
was
tired
of
giving
information
and
getting
none
the
answer
came
from
one
in
the
group
yes
that
french
feller
came
in
with
a
couple
o
horses
he
camped
away
over
there
beyond
muskeeter
he
pointed
down
bonanza
you
wo
mind
just
mentionin
said
maudie
with
growing
irritation
why
you
makin
yourself
so
busy
about
my
friends
only
strong
resentment
could
have
induced
the
plural
when
she
heard
what
had
happened
and
what
was
suspected
she
uttered
a
contemptuous
tschah
and
made
for
the
tent
the
constable
followed
she
wheeled
fiercely
round
the
man
in
there
has
been
out
o
this
tent
since
he
was
carried
up
from
the
creek
last
night
i
can
swear
to
it
can
you
swear
the
other
was
here
all
the
time
no
answer
did
he
say
what
he
went
to
dawson
for
the
doctor
one
or
two
laughed
who
sick
enough
to
send
for
a
dawson
doctor
so
you
think
he
gone
for
a
i
know
he
is
and
do
you
know
what
it
costs
to
have
a
doctor
come
all
the
way
out
here
yes
beasts
wo
budge
till
you
handed
over
five
hundred
dollars
skunks
did
your
friend
mention
how
he
meant
to
raise
the
dust
he
got
it
she
said
curtly
why
he
was
livin
off
his
pardner
had
a
red
cent
she
shieldin
him
the
men
about
the
door
agreed
lord
he
done
it
well
got
away
with
five
hundred
and
a
horse
he
had
words
with
austin
himself
the
night
o
the
sassed
scowl
austin
right
quiet
but
oh
my
told
him
to
his
face
his
gold
was
dirty
and
washed
it
off
his
hands
with
a
look
gawd
you
could
see
austin
was
mad
clear
through
from
his
to
his
spine
you
bet
scowl
said
something
back
that
got
the
young
feller
monkey
up
they
all
agreed
that
the
only
wonder
was
that
austin
had
lived
as
long
on
the
other
side
o
the
line
gee
that
evening
the
boy
riding
hard
came
into
camp
with
a
doctor
followed
discreetly
in
the
rear
by
an
really
mounted
this
time
it
had
occurred
to
the
boy
that
people
looked
at
him
hard
and
when
he
saw
the
groups
gathered
about
the
tent
his
heart
contracted
sharply
had
the
colonel
died
he
flung
himself
off
the
horse
winced
as
his
foot
cried
out
told
joey
bludsoe
to
look
after
both
beasts
a
minute
and
led
the
dawson
doctor
towards
the
tent
the
constable
followed
maudie
at
the
door
looked
at
her
old
enemy
queerly
and
just
as
without
greeting
he
pushed
by
you
heard
scowl
dead
she
said
in
a
low
voice
no
dead
eh
well
there
one
rattlesnake
less
in
the
woods
the
constable
stopped
him
with
a
touch
on
the
shoulder
we
have
a
warrant
for
you
the
colonel
lifted
his
head
and
stared
about
in
a
dazed
way
as
the
boy
stopped
short
and
stammered
warr
what
for
for
the
murder
of
scoville
look
here
he
whispered
i
i
do
know
what
you
mean
but
i
go
along
with
you
of
course
only
do
talk
before
this
man
sick
he
beckoned
the
doctor
this
is
the
man
i
brought
you
to
see
then
he
turned
his
back
on
the
wide
horrified
eyes
of
his
friend
saying
back
in
a
minute
kentucky
outside
give
me
a
second
boys
will
you
he
said
to
the
just
till
i
hear
what
that
doctor
fella
says
about
my
pardner
he
stood
there
with
the
buckeyes
the
police
and
the
various
day
gangs
that
were
too
excited
to
go
to
bed
and
he
asked
them
where
austin
was
found
and
other
details
of
the
murder
wearily
conscious
that
the
friendliest
there
felt
sure
that
the
man
who
questioned
could
best
fill
in
the
gaps
in
the
story
when
the
doctor
came
out
maudie
at
his
heels
firing
off
quick
questions
the
boy
hobbled
forward
well
temperature
a
hundred
and
four
said
the
dawson
doctor
oh
is
is
that
much
or
little
well
it
more
than
most
of
us
go
in
for
can
you
tell
what
the
matter
with
him
oh
typhoid
of
course
the
boy
pulled
his
hat
over
his
eyes
guess
you
wo
mind
my
stayin
now
said
maudie
at
his
elbow
speaking
low
he
looked
up
you
goin
to
take
care
of
him
good
care
he
asked
harshly
but
maudie
seemed
not
to
mind
the
tears
went
down
her
cheeks
as
with
never
a
word
she
nodded
and
turned
towards
the
tent
say
he
hobbled
after
her
that
doctor
all
right
only
wanted
fifty
he
laid
four
bills
in
her
hand
she
seemed
about
to
speak
when
he
interrupted
hoarsely
and
look
here
pull
the
colonel
through
maudie
pull
him
through
i
do
my
darnedest
he
held
out
his
hand
he
had
never
given
it
to
her
before
and
he
forgot
that
few
people
would
care
now
to
take
it
but
she
gave
him
hers
with
no
grudging
then
on
a
sudden
impulse
you
ai
takin
him
to
dawson
she
said
to
the
constable
he
nodded
why
he
done
the
trip
twice
already
i
can
do
it
again
well
enough
then
you
got
to
wait
a
minute
she
spoke
to
the
constable
as
if
she
had
been
captain
constantine
himself
better
just
go
in
and
see
the
colonel
she
said
to
the
boy
he
been
askin
for
you
maudie
i
can
go
to
dawson
all
right
but
i
do
feel
up
to
goin
in
there
again
you
be
sorry
if
you
do
and
then
he
knew
what
a
temperature
at
a
hundred
and
four
foreboded
he
went
back
into
the
tent
dreading
to
face
the
colonel
more
than
he
had
ever
dreaded
anything
in
his
life
but
the
sick
man
lay
looking
out
drowsily
peacefully
through
eyes
not
greatly
concerned
one
would
say
about
anything
the
boy
went
over
and
stood
under
the
gray
blanket
canopy
looking
down
with
a
choking
sensation
that
delayed
his
question
how
you
now
kentucky
all
right
why
that
good
news
then
you
you
wo
mind
my
goin
off
to
to
do
a
little
prospectin

sick
man
frowned

right
where
you
are
there
plenty
in
that
jampot
yes

jampot
fillin
up
fine
besides
the
low
voice
wavered
on
did
we
agree
we
learned
the
lesson
o
the
north
the
lesson
o
the
north
repeated
the
other
with
filling
eyes
yes
sah
a
man
alone
a
man
lost
we
got
to
stick
together
boy
the
eyelids
fell
heavily
yes
yes
colonel
he
pressed
the
big
hand
his
mouth
made
the
motion
not
the
sound
pardner
chapter

despair
lies
down
and

the
burden
of
its

to

not

at
happiness
george
meredith
everybody
on
bonanza
knew
that
the
colonel
had
left
off
struggling
to
get
out
of
his
bed
to
go
to
work
had
left
off
calling
for
his
pardner
quite
in
his
right
senses
again
he
could
take
in
maudie
explanation
that
the
boy
was
gone
to
dawson
probably
to
get
something
for
the
colonel
to
eat
for
the
doctor
was
a
crank
and
would
let
the
sick
man
have
his
beans
and
bacon
forbade
him
even
such
a
delicacy
as
fresh
pork
though
the
buckeyes
nobly
offered
to
slaughter
one
of
their
pigs
the
first
that
ever
rooted
in
bonanza
refuse
and
more
a
terror
to
the
passing
indian
than
any
bear
or
wolf
but
the
boy
a
long
time
the
colonel
would
say
wistfully
before
this
quieter
phase
set
in
maudie
had
sent
into
dawson
for
potts
and
mac
that
they
might
distract
the
colonel
mind
from
the
pardner
she
knew
could
not
return
but
having
married
the
girl
at
the
moosehorn
caf√©
had
excuse
of
ancient
validity
for
not
coming
potts
was
busy
breaking
the
faro
bank
and
mac
was
waiting
till
an
overdue
lower
river
steamer
should
arrive
nicholas
of
pymeut
had
gone
back
as
pilot
of
the
weare
but
princess
muckluck
was
still
about
now
with
skookum
bill
son
of
the
local
chief
now
alone
trudging
up
and
down
bonanza
like
one
looking
for
something
lost
the
colonel
heard
her
voice
outside
the
tent
and
had
her
in
you
goin
to
marry
skookum
bill
as
they
say
muckluck
only
laughed
but
the
indian
hung
about
waiting
the
pleasure
when
your
pardner
come
back
she
would
indiscreetly
ask
the
colonel
why
he
goes
to
dawson
and
every
few
hours
she
would
return
why
he
stay
so
long
at
last
maudie
took
her
outside
and
told
her
muckluck
gaped
sat
down
a
minute
and
rocked
her
body
back
and
forth
with
hidden
face
got
up
and
called
sharply
skookum
they
took
the
trail
for
town
potts
said
when
he
passed
them
they
were
going
as
if
the
devil
were
at
their
heels
would
even
stop
to
say
how
the
colonel
was
so
potts
had
come
to
see
for
himself
and
to
bring
the
colonel
some
letters
just
arrived
mac
was
close
behind
but
the
boy
they
would
let
anybody
see
him
and
potts
shook
his
head
well
you
can
come
in
said
maudie
if
you
keep
your
head
shut
about
the
boy
the
colonel
was
lying
flat
with
that
unfaltering
of
the
sick
now
his
vision
dropped
to
the
level
of
faces
at
the
door
hello
but
as
they
advanced
he
looked
behind
them
anxiously
only
mac
no
kaviak
at
his
heels
and
the
sick
man
disappointment
lightened
to
a
smile
he
would
have
held
out
a
hand
but
maudie
stopped
him
she
took
the
little
fellow
fingers
and
laid
them
on
the
colonel
now
sit
down
and
be
quiet
she
said
nervously
potts
and
mac
obeyed
but
kaviak
had
fastened
his
fine
little
hand
on
the
weak
one
and
anchored
so
stared
about
taking
his
bearings
how
did
you
get
to
the
klondyke
kaviak
said
the
colonel
in
a
thin
breathy
voice
came
up
with
sister
winifred
farva
answered
for
him
she
was
sent
for
to
help
with
the
epidemic
dyin
like
flies
in
dawson
h
ahem
apologetic
glance
at
maudie
sister
winifred
promised
to
keep
kaviak
with
her
woman
of
her
word
well
what
you
think
o
dawson
the
low
voice
asked
kaviak
understood
the
look
at
least
and
smiled
back
grew
suddenly
grave
intent
looked
sharply
round
loosed
his
hold
of
the
colonel
bent
down
and
retired
behind
the
bed
that
was
where
nig
was
their
foregathering
added
nothing
to
the
tranquility
of
the
occasion
and
both
were
driven
forth
by
maudie
potts
read
the
colonel
his
letters
and
helped
him
to
sign
a
couple
of
cheques
the
louisville
instructions
had
come
through
at
last
after
that
the
colonel
slept
and
when
he
woke
it
was
only
to
wander
away
into
that
world
where
maudie
was
lost
utterly
and
where
the
colonel
was
at
home
there
was
chastening
in
such
hours
for
maudie
of
min√≥ok
now
he
found
the
other
one
she
would
say
to
herself
the
one
he
was
looking
for
that
same
evening
as
they
sat
in
the
tent
in
an
interval
of
relief
from
the
colonel
muttering
monotone
they
heard
nig
making
some
sort
of
unusual
manifestation
outside
heard
the
grunting
of
those
pioneer
pigs
heard
sounds
of
a
whispered
sh
kaviak
shut
up
nig
then
a
low
tuneless
crooning
wen
yo
see
a

along

it

en

move
down

why
the
boy
back
said
the
colonel
suddenly
in
a
clear
collected
voice
maudie
had
jumped
up
but
the
boy
put
his
head
in
the
tent
smiling
and
calling
out
they
told
me
he
was
getting
on
all
right
but
i
just
thought
maybe
he
was
asleep
he
came
in
and
bent
over
his
pardner
hello
everybody
why
you
got
it
so
fine
and
dark
in
here
i
can
hardly
see
how
well
you
lookin
colonel
and
he
dropped
into
the
nurse
place
by
the
bedside
maudie
lined
the
tent
with
black
drill
said
the
colonel
you
brought
home
anything
to
eat
well
no
maudie
telegraphed
found
it
all
i
could
do
to
bring
myself
back
oh
well
that
the
main
thing
said
the
colonel
battling
with
disappointment
pricked
by
some
quickened
memory
of
the
boy
last
i
had
pretty
queer
dreams
about
you
been
maudie
the
meanest
kind
of
a
time
do
go
gassin
colonel
admonished
the
nurse
it
pretty
tough
i
can
tell
you
he
said
irritably
to
be
as
weak
as
a
baby
and
to
have
to
let
other
people
must
talk
ordered
mac
the
colonel
raised
his
head
with
sudden
anger
it
did
not
mend
matters
that
maudie
was
there
to
hold
him
down
before
a
lot
of
men
you
go
to
halifax
said
the
boy
to
mac
blustering
a
trifle
the
colonel
may
stand
a
little
orderin
about
from
maudie
do
blame
him
but
kentucky
ai
going
to
be
bossed
by
any
of
us
the
colonel
lay
quite
still
again
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
quietly
enough
reckon
i
in
the
kind
of
a
fix
when
a
man
got
to
take
orders
foolishness
do
let
him
jolly
you
boys
the
colonel
always
sayin
he
ai
a
soldier
but
i
reckon
you
better
look
out
how
you
rile
kentucky
the
sick
man
ignored
the
trifling
the
worst
of
it
is
bein
so
useless
useless
you
just
wait
till
you
see
what
a
lot
o
use
we
mean
to
make
of
you
no
crawlin
out
of
it
like
that
it
quite
true
said
mac
harshly
we
all
kind
of
look
to
you
still
course
we
do
the
boy
turned
to
the
others
the
comin
all
the
way
out
from
dawson
to
get
kentucky
opinion
on
a
big
scheme
o
theirs
did
you
ever
hear
what
that
lincoln

when
the
civil
war

like
to
have

my
side
but
i
must
have

arrested
they
thought
i
cleared
scowl
austin
off
the
earth
do
they
know
who
did
potts
and
maudie
asked
in
a
breath
that
klondyke
indian
that
sweet
on
princess
muckluck
what
had
austin
done
to
him
nothin
reckon
skookum
bill
was
about
the
only
man
on
bonanza
who
had
no
objection
to
the
owner
of
o
said
so
in
court
what
did
he
kill
him
for
well
said
the
boy
it
just
one
o
those
things
that
happen
up
here
you
saw
that
indian
that
came
in
with
nicholas
some
years
ago
he
killed
a
drunken
white
man
who
was
after
him
with
a
knife
there
was
no
means
of
tryin
the
indian
where
the
thing
happened
so
he
was
taken
outside
the
court
found
he
done
the
killin
in
and
sent
him
back
well
sir
that
native
had
the
time
of
his
life
bein
tried
for
murder
he
travelled
on
a
railroad
seen
a
white
man
city
lived
like
a
lord
and
came
home
to
be
the
most
famous
man
of
his
tribe
got
a
taste
for
travel
too
comes
to
the
klondyke
and
his
fame
fires
skookum
bill
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
kill
one
o
these
white
men
and
they
take
you
and
show
you
all
the
wonders
o
the
earth
so
he
puts
a
bullet
into
austin
why
did
he
own
up
then
and
get
his
reward
muckluck
knew
better
made
him
hold
his
tongue
about
it
and
then
made
him
own
up
when
she
saw
the
boy
nodded
what
goin
to
happen
oh
he
swing
instead
o
me
by
the
way
colonel
a
fella
hunted
me
up
this
mornin
who
been
to
min√≥ok
looked
good
to
him
i
sold
out
idaho
bar
to
buy
back
your
orange
grove
he
shook
his
head
to
pay
my
debts
and
start
over
again
when
the
dawson
doctor
left
that
night
maudie
as
usual
followed
him
out
they
waited
a
long
time
for
her
to
come
back
perhaps
she
gone
to
her
own
tent
and
the
boy
went
to
see
he
found
her
where
the
colonel
used
to
go
to
smoke
sitting
staring
out
to
nowhere
as
the
boy
looked
closer
he
saw
she
had
been
crying
for
even
in
the
midst
of
honest
service
maudie
like
many
a
fine
lady
before
her
could
not
forego
the
use
of
cosmetic
her
cheeks
were
streaked
and
stained
five
dollars
a
box
here
too
she
said
mechanically
as
she
wiped
some
of
the
rouge
off
with
a
handkerchief
her
hand
shook
what
the
matter
it
all
up
she
answered
not
with
him
he
motioned
towards
the
tent
she
nodded
doctor
says
so
and
i
knew
it
before
only
i
would
believe
it
she
had
spoken
with
little
agitation
but
now
she
flung
her
arms
out
with
a
sudden
anguish
that
oddly
took
the
air
of
tossing
into
space
bonanza
and
its
treasure
it
was
the
motion
of
one
who
renounces
the
thing
that
means
the
most
a
final
fling
in
the
face
of
the
gods
the
boy
stood
quite
still
submitting
his
heart
to
that
first
quick
rending
and
tearing
asunder
which
is
only
the
initial
agony
of
parting
how
soon
he
said
without
raising
his
eyes
oh
he
holds
on
it
may
be
a
day
or
two
the
boy
walked
slowly
away
towards
the
ridge
of
the
low
hill
maudie
turned
and
watched
him
on
the
top
of
the
divide
he
stopped
looking
over
whatever
it
was
he
saw
off
there
he
could
not
meet
it
yet
he
flung
himself
down
with
his
face
in
the
and
lay
there
all
night
long
kaviak
was
sent
after
him
in
the
morning
but
only
to
say
breakfast
maudie
tent
the
boy
saw
that
mac
and
potts
knew
for
the
first
time
the
big
chimney
men
felt
a
barrier
between
them
and
that
one
who
had
been
the
common
bond
keeping
the
incongruous
allied
and
friendly
only
nig
ran
in
and
out
unchilled
by
the
imminence
of
the
colonel
withdrawal
from
his
kind
towards
noon
the
came
up
the
creek
and
were
stopped
near
the
tent
by
the
others
they
all
stood
talking
low
till
a
noise
of
scuffling
broke
the
silence
within
they
drew
nearer
and
heard
the
colonel
telling
maudie
not
to
turn
out
nig
and
kaviak
i
like
seein
my
friends
where
the
boy
so
they
went
in
did
he
know
he
must
know
or
he
would
have
asked
what
the
devil
made
him
look
like
that
all
he
said
was
hello
how
do
you
do
madam
and
he
made
a
weak
motion
of
one
hand
towards
to
do
duty
for
that
splendid
bow
of
his
then
as
no
one
spoke
too
late
too
late
had
a
job
in
your
line
then
suddenly
maudie
worth
the
whole
lot
of
you
they
knew
it
was
his
way
of
saying
she
told
me
they
all
sat
and
looked
at
the
floor
nothing
happened
for
a
long
time
at
last
well
you
all
know
what
my
next
move
is
what
yours
there
was
another
silence
but
not
nearly
so
long
what
prospects
pardners
he
repeated
the
boy
looked
at
maudie
she
made
a
little
gesture
of
i
done
all
the
fightin
i
good
for
the
colonel
eyes
clear
again
and
tranquil
travelled
from
face
to
face
cleared
his
throat
but
it
was
mac
who
spoke
yes
a
we
would
like
to
hold
a
last
hold
a
counsel
o
war
always
kind
o
followed
your
notions
at
least
veracity
pared
down
the
compliment
at
least
you
ca
say
but
what
we
always
listened
to
you
yes
you
might
just
a
start
us
as
well
as
you
can
says
potts
the
colonel
smiled
a
little
each
man
still
starting
forever
starting
for
somewhere
or
something
until
he
should
come
to
this
place
where
the
colonel
was
even
he
why
he
was
starting
too
for
him
this
was
no
end
other
than
a
chapter
ending
but
these
men
he
had
lived
and
suffered
with
they
all
wanted
to
talk
the
next
move
over
not
his
theirs
all
except
the
boy
it
seemed
mac
was
in
the
act
of
changing
his
place
to
be
nearer
the
colonel
when
potts
adroitly
forestalled
him
the
others
drew
off
a
little
and
made
desultory
talk
while
potts
in
an
undertone
told
how
he
had
a
run
of
bad
luck
no
doubt
it
would
turn
but
if
ever
he
got
enough
again
to
pay
his
passage
home
he
put
it
in
the
bank
and
never
risk
it
i
swear
i
would
i
got
to
go
out
in
the
fall
goin
to
get
myself
married
christmas
and
if
she
willing
we
come
up
here
on
the
first
boat
in
the
spring
with
backing
this
time
he
showed
a
picture
the
colonel
studied
it
i
believe
she
come
he
said
and
potts
was
so
far
from
clairvoyance
that
he
laughed
awkwardly
flattered
then
anxiously
wish
i
was
sure
o
my
passage
money
when
potts
before
he
meant
to
had
yielded
place
to
the
colonel
was
sworn
to
secrecy
and
listened
to
excited
whispers
of
gold
in
the
sand
off
yonder
on
the
coast
of
the
behring
sea
the
world
in
general
would
know
the
authenticity
of
the
new
strike
till
next
season
he
and
would
take
the
first
boat
sailing
out
of
san
francisco
in
the
spring
oh
you
going
outside
too
in
the
fahll
yes
yes
ye
see
i
ai
like
the
rest
i
got
to
consider
dawson
great
but
it
ai
the
place
to
start
a
famully
where
you
goin
mac
said
the
colonel
to
the
irate
one
who
was
making
for
the
door
i
want
a
little
talk
with
you
mac
turned
back
and
consented
to
express
his
opinion
of
the
money
there
was
to
be
made
out
of
tailings
by
means
of
a
new
hydraulic
process
he
was
going
to
lend
kaviak
to
sister
winifred
again
on
the
old
terms
she
take
him
along
when
she
returned
to
holy
cross
and
mac
would
go
outside
raise
a
little
capital
return
and
make
a
fortune
for
the
moment
he
was
broke
had
even
passage
money
did
the
colonel
think
he
could
the
colonel
seemed
absorbed
in
that
eternal
interrogation
of
the
mine
you
know
mac
drew
nearer
still
and
went
on
in
the
lowered
voice
mine
a
special
case
a
man
bound
to
do
all
he
can
for
his
boys
i
did
know
you
had
boys
mac
jerked
yes
with
his
square
head
bobbie
goin
on
six
now
the
others
older
others
mac
stared
an
instant
oh
there
only
one
more
he
grinned
with
embarrassment
and
hitched
his
head
towards
kaviak
i
guess
you
jawed
enough
said
maudie
leaving
the
others
and
coming
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
maudie
goin
back
too
said
the
sick
man
she
nodded
and
you
never
goin
to
leave
her
again
no
maudie
a
little
bit
of
all
right
said
the
patient
the
big
chimney
men
assented
but
with
sudden
misgiving
what
was
that
job
ye
said
ye
were
wantin
me
forr
oh
maudie
got
a
friend
of
hers
to
fix
it
up
fix
what
up
demanded
potts
little
postscript
to
my
will
mac
jerked
his
head
at
the
nurse
with
that
clear
sight
of
dying
eyes
the
colonel
understood
a
meaner
spirit
would
have
been
galled
at
the
part
those
louisville
instructions
had
been
playing
but
cheap
cynicism
was
not
in
the
colonel
line
he
knew
the
awful
pinch
of
life
up
here
and
he
thought
no
less
of
his
comrades
for
asking
that
last
service
of
getting
them
home
but
it
was
the
day
of
the
final
for
the
colonel
he
must
not
leave
misapprehension
behind
i
wanted
maudie
to
have
my
min√≥ok
claim
got
a
min√≥ok
claim
o
my
own
so
i
left
it
to
be
divided
they
all
looked
up
to
go
to
a
little
girl
in
and
the
other
half
well
i
left
the
other
half
to
kaviak
strikes
me
he
ought
to
have
a
little
piece
o
the
north
oh
yes
good
idea
mac
thought
he
go
over
to
the
other
tent
and
cook
some
dinner
there
was
a
general
movement
as
they
were
going
out
boy
yes
he
came
back
nig
followed
and
the
two
stood
by
the
waiting
their
colonel
orders
do
you
go
wastin
any
more
time
huntin
i
do
mean
to
go
back
to
your
own
work
go
back
to
your
own
people
the
boy
listened
and
looked
away
it
good
to
go
pioneering
but
it
good
to
go
home
the
face
on
the
pillow
was
convulsed
for
that
swift
passing
moment
best
of
all
to
go
home
and
if
you
leave
your
home
too
long
your
home
leaves
you
home
does
seem
so
important
as
it
did
when
i
came
up
here
the
colonel
fastened
one
hand
feverishly
on
his
pardner
arm
i
been
afraid
of
that
it
magic
break
away
promise
me
you
go
back
and
stay
lord
lord
he
laughed
feebly
to
think
a
fella
should
have
to
be
urged
to
leave
the
north
alone
wonderful
place
but
black
magic
in
it
or
who
ever
come
who
ever
stay
he
looked
anxiously
into
the
boy
set
face
i
not
saying
the
time
was
wasted
he
went
on
i
reckon
it
was
a
good
thing
you
came
yes
it
was
a
good
thing
i
came
you
learned
a
thing
or
two
several
specially
on
the
long
trail
most
of
all
on
the
long
trail
the
colonel
shut
his
eyes
maudie
came
and
held
a
cup
to
his
lips
thank
you
i
begin
to
feel
a
little
foggy
what
was
it
we
learned
on
the
trail
pardner
but
the
boy
had
turned
away
was
it
did
we
learn
how
near
a
tolerable
decent
man
is
to
bein
a
villain
we
learned
that
a
man
ca
be
quite
a
brute
as
long
as
he
sticks
to
another
man
oh
was
that
it
in
the
night
maudie
went
away
to
sleep
the
boy
watched
do
you
know
what
i
thinking
about
the
sick
man
said
suddenly
about
that
lady
down
at
home
guess
again
about
those
fellas
at
holy
cross
no
i
never
was
as
taken
up
with
the
jesuits
as
you
were
no
sah
thinkin
about
the
czar
poor
old
colonel
he
was
wandering
again
did
i
ever
tell
you
i
saw
him
once
no
did
had
a
good
look
at
him
knew
a
fella
in
petersburg
too
that
he
rested
a
moment
that
czar
all
right
only
he
sends
the
wrong
people
to
siberia
ought
to
go
himself
and
take
his
ministers
for
a
winter
on
the
trail
on
his
face
suddenly
the
old
look
but
lord
bless
you
is
only
the
czar
we
all
have
times
o
thinkin
we
some
punkins
specially
kentuckians
i
reckon
most
men
have
their
days
when
they
twelve
feet
high
and
would
stoop
to
say
ye
to
a
king
let
go
on
the
winter
trail
yes
agreed
the
boy
they
find
out
and
he
stopped
plenty
o
use
for
head
men
though
the
faint
voice
rang
with
an
echo
of
the
old
authority
no
foolishness
but
just
plain
the
one
that
doin
the
leadin
like
nig
here
and
it
my
business
to
lick
the
hind
dog
if
he
shirks
he
held
out
his
hand
and
closed
it
over
his
friend
i
was
boss
o
the
big
chimney
boy
but
you
were
boss
the
trail
the
colonel
was
buried
in
the
old
moose
pasture
with
people
standing
by
who
knew
that
the
world
had
worn
a
friendlier
face
because
he
had
been
in
it
that
much
was
clear
even
before
it
was
found
that
he
had
left
to
each
of
the
big
chimney
men
five
hundred
dollars
not
to
be
drawn
except
for
the
purpose
of
going
home
they
thought
it
was
the
sense
of
that
security
that
made
them
put
off
the
day
they
would
play
the
game
up
to
the
last
moment
and
see
september
end
brought
no
great
change
in
fortune
but
a
change
withal
of
deep
significance
the
ice
had
begun
to
run
in
the
yukon
no
man
needed
telling
it
would
be
a
tuhble
wintah
and
dey
better
move
down
souf
all
the
late
boats
by
both
routes
had
been
packed
those
men
who
had
failed
and
yet
most
tenacious
were
hanging
on
for
some
last
lucky
turn
of
the
wheel
knew
the
risk
they
ran
and
now
the
final
boat
of
the
year
was
going
down
the
long
way
to
the
behring
sea
and
by
the
canadian
route
open
a
little
longer
the
big
chimney
men
by
grace
of
that
one
left
behind
would
be
on
the
last
ship
to
shoot
the
rapids
in
not
only
to
the
thousands
who
were
going
to
those
who
stayed
behind
there
was
something
in
the
leaving
of
the
last
boat
something
that
knocked
upon
the
heart
they
too
could
still
go
home
they
gathered
at
the
docks
and
told
one
another
they
would
leave
dawson
for
fifty
thousand
dollars
then
looked
at
the
failures
with
eyes
remembering
those
months
before
the
luckiest
klondyker
could
hear
from
the
world
outside
between
now
and
then
what
would
have
come
to
pass
up
here
and
what
down
there
below
the
boy
had
got
a
place
for
muckluck
in
the
store
she
was
handy
at
repairing
and
working
in
fur
and
said
she
was
all
right
on
this
bright
autumn
morning
when
the
boy
went
in
to
say
with
a
white
woman
and
an
indian
boy
in
a
little
room
overlooking
the
muckluck
was
working
in
the
intervals
of
watching
the
crowds
on
the
wharf
eyes
more
experienced
than
hers
might
well
stare
probably
in
no
other
place
upon
the
globe
was
gathered
as
motley
a
crew
english
indian
scandinavian
french
german
negroes
chinese
poles
japs
finns
all
the
fine
gentlemen
had
escaped
by
earlier
boats
all
the
smart
young
women
with
their
buttons
as
big
as
your
thumb
lucky
miners
from
the
creeks
with
heavy
consignments
of
dust
to
take
home
had
been
too
wary
to
run
any
risk
of
the
closing
inopportunely
the
great
majority
here
on
the
wharf
dazed
or
excited
lugging
miscellaneous
possessions
things
they
had
clung
to
in
straits
so
desperate
they
knew
no
more
how
to
relax
their
hold
than
dead
fingers
do
these
were
men
whose
last
chance
had
been
the
klondyke
and
who
here
as
elsewhere
had
failed
many
who
came
in
young
were
going
out
old
but
the
odd
thing
was
that
those
worst
off
went
out
game
no
whining
none
of
the
ostentatious
pathos
of
those
broken
on
the
wheel
of
a
great
city
a
man
under
muckluck
window
dressed
in
a
shirt
straw
hat
broadcloth
trousers
and
carpet
slippers
in
one
hand
a
tin
pail
in
the
other
something
tied
in
a
handkerchief
called
out
lustily
to
a
ragged
individual
cleaving
a
way
through
the
throng
got
your
stuff
aboard
yes
goin
to
get
it
off
i
ai
goin
home
till
next
year
and
the
face
above
the
shirt
was
stricken
with
a
sudden
envy
without
any
telling
he
knew
just
how
his
pardner
heart
had
failed
him
when
it
came
to
turning
his
tattered
back
on
the
possibilities
of
the
klondyke
oh
i
comin
back
soon
i
get
a
i
ai
said
another
with
a
dazed
expression
a
klondyker
carrying
home
his
the
one
thing
apparently
saved
out
of
the
wreck
you
think
you
ai
comin
back
just
wait
once
you
lived
up
here
the
outside
ai
good
enough
fur
yer
right
said
an
old
you
can
try
it
but
lord
how
miss
this
yukon
among
the
hundreds
running
about
talking
bustling
hauling
heterogeneous
luggage
sending
last
letters
doing
last
deals
a
score
of
women
either
going
by
this
boat
or
saying
to
those
who
were
and
potts
the
and
mac
waiting
to
hand
over
kaviak
to
sister
winifred
the
boy
at
the
open
window
above
staring
down
on
the
tatterdemalion
throng
remembered
his
first
meeting
with
the
big
chimney
men
as
the
washington
city
steamed
out
of
san
francisco
golden
gate
a
year
and
a
month
before
of
course
even
in
default
of
finding
millions
something
stirring
might
have
happened
something
heroic
rewarding
to
the
spirit
if
no
other
how
but
his
own
special
revelation
blurred
swamped
for
the
moment
in
the
common
wreck
he
said
to
himself
that
nothing
of
the
sort
had
befallen
the
big
chimney
men
any
more
than
to
the
whipped
and
bankrupt
crew
struggling
down
there
on
the
wharf
they
simply
had
failed
all
alike
and
yet
there
was
between
them
and
the
common
failures
of
the
world
one
abiding
difference
these
had
greatly
dared
as
long
as
the
meanest
in
that
crowd
drew
breath
and
held
to
memory
so
long
might
he
remember
the
brave
and
terrible
days
of
the
klondyke
rush
and
that
he
had
borne
in
it
his
heavy
share
no
share
in
any
mine
save
that
the
knowledge
that
he
was
not
among
the
vast
majority
who
sit
dully
to
the
end
beside
what
things
they
were
born
to
the
earnings
of
other
men
the
savings
of
other
women
afraid
to
go
seeking
after
better
lest
they
lose
the
good
they
have
they
had
failed
but
it
could
never
be
said
of
a
klondyker
that
he
had
not
tried
he
might
in
truth
look
down
upon
the
smug
majority
that
smiles
at
unusual
endeavour
unless
success
excuses
crowns
it
no
one
there
after
all
so
poor
but
he
had
one
possession
treasured
among
kings
and
he
had
risked
it
what
could
a
man
do
more
muckluck
boat
canada
way
no
go
till
thursday
thursday
yes
he
said
absently
eyes
still
on
the
american
ship
then
why
you
say
lot
to
do
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
you
were
all
right
her
creamy
face
was
suddenly
alight
but
not
with
gratitude
oh
yes
all
right
here
she
said
haughtily
i
not
like
much
the
boston
men
king
george
men
best
it
was
so
her
sore
heart
abjured
her
country
for
among
the
natives
of
the
klondyke
white
history
stops
where
it
began
when
george
the
third
was
king
i
think
she
shot
sideways
a
shrewd
look
i
think
i
marry
a
king
george
man
and
at
the
prospect
her
head
drooped
heavily
then
you
want
to
wear
this
at
your
wedding
the
boy
drew
his
hand
out
of
his
pocket
threw
a
over
her
bent
head
and
when
she
could
see
clear
again
her
katharine
medal
was
swinging
below
her
waist
and
the
boston
man
was
gone
she
stared
with
blinded
eyes
out
of
the
window
till
suddenly
in
the
mist
one
face
was
clear
the
boy
standing
still
down
there
in
the
hands
in
pockets
staring
at
the
ship
suddenly
sister
winifred
her
black
veil
swirling
in
the
wind
an
orderly
from
mary
hospital
following
with
a
little
trunk
at
the
gangway
she
is
stopped
by
the
purser
asked
some
questions
smiles
at
first
and
shakes
her
head
and
then
in
dismay
clasps
her
hands
seeming
to
plead
while
the
whistle
shrieks
muckluck
turned
and
flew
down
the
dark
little
stair
threaded
her
way
in
and
out
among
the
bystanders
on
the
wharf
till
she
reached
the
sister
side
the
nun
was
saying
that
she
not
only
had
no
money
but
that
a
yukon
purser
must
surely
know
the
sisters
were
forbidden
to
carry
it
he
could
not
doubt
but
the
passage
money
would
be
made
good
when
they
got
to
holy
cross
but
the
purser
was
a
new
man
and
when
mac
and
others
who
knew
the
yukon
custom
expostulated
he
hustled
them
aside
and
told
sister
winifred
to
stand
back
the
gangway
was
going
up
it
was
then
the
boy
came
and
spoke
to
the
man
finally
drew
out
some
money
and
paid
the
fare
the
nun
not
recognising
him
too
bewildered
by
this
rough
passage
with
the
world
even
to
thank
the
stranger
stood
motionless
grasping
kaviak
hand
two
children
you
would
say
her
long
veil
blowing
hurrying
on
before
her
to
that
haven
in
the
waste
the
mission
at
holy
cross
again
the
boy
was
delaying
the
upward
swing
of
the
gangway
the
trunk
must
come
on
board
two
men
rushed
for
it
while
he
held
down
the
gang
must
cry
he
said
to
muckluck
you
see
sister
winifred
again
not
for
that
i
cry
ah
i
never
shall
have
happiness
yes
that
trunk
he
called
in
the
babel
of
voices
shouting
from
ship
and
shore
the
boy
heard
princess
muckluck
saying
with
catches
in
her
breath
i
always
knew
i
would
get
no
luck
why
ah
i
was
a
bad
child
the
baddest
of
all
the
pymeut
children
yes
yes
they
got
it
now
the
boy
shouted
up
to
the
captain
then
low
and
smiling
absently
what
did
you
do
that
was
so
bad
princess
me
i
i
mocked
at
the
geese
it
was
the
summer
they
were
so
late
and
as
they
flew
past
pymeut
i
yes
i
mocked
at
them
a
swaying
and
breaking
of
the
crowd
the
little
trunk
flung
on
board
the
men
rushing
back
to
the
wharf
the
gang
lifted
and
the
last
lower
river
boat
swung
out
into
the
stream
keen
to
piercing
a
cry
rang
out
muckluck
stop
they
carry
him
off
it
is
meestake
oh
oh
the
boy
was
standing
nig
beside
him
rushed
to
the
wharf
edge
and
screamed
at
the
captain
to
stop
be
the
siven
mac
issued
orders
most
peremptory
muckluck
wept
as
excitedly
as
though
there
had
never
been
question
of
the
boy
going
away
but
while
the
noise
rose
and
fell
potts
drawled
a
guess
he
means
to
go
that
way
no
he
do
stop
you
captain
stop
your
boat
well
said
a
bystander
i
never
seen
any
feller
as
calm
as
that
who
was
bein
took
the
way
he
did
want
to
go
d
mean
there
a
new
strike
the
suggestion
flashed
electric
through
the
crowd
it
was
the
only
possible
explanation
he
knows
what
he
about
lord
i
wish
i
froze
to
him
yep
said
buck
one
never
seen
that
young
feller
when
he
looked
more
like
he
would
give
a
whoop
in
hell
to
change
places
with
anybody
as
back
from
his
chase
hoarse
and
puffing
stopped
suddenly
be
the
siven
father
brachet
said
the
little
divil
be
coming
back
to
howly
cross
where
that
lower
river

through
your
hat
