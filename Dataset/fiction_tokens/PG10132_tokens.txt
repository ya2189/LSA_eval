chapter
i
a
waif
on
the
steppe
in
this
country
charity
covers
no
sins
the
speaker
finished
his
remark
with
a
short
laugh
he
was
a
big
stout
man
his
name
was
karl
steinmetz
and
it
is
a
name
well
known
in
the
government
of
tver
to
this
day
he
spoke
jerkily
as
stout
men
do
when
they
ride
and
when
he
had
laughed
his
laugh
he
closed
his
lips
beneath
a
huge
gray
mustache
so
far
as
one
could
judge
from
the
action
of
a
square
and
deeply
indented
chin
his
mouth
was
expressive
at
that
time
and
possibly
at
all
times
of
a
humorous
resignation
no
reply
was
vouchsafed
to
him
and
karl
steinmetz
bumped
along
on
his
little
cossack
horse
which
was
stretched
out
at
a
gallop
evening
was
drawing
on
it
was
late
in
october
and
a
cold
wind
was
driving
from
the
across
a
plain
which
for
sheer
dismalness
of
aspect
may
give
points
to
sahara
and
beat
that
abode
of
mental
depression
without
an
effort
so
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
there
was
no
habitation
to
break
the
line
of
horizon
a
few
stunted
standing
in
a
position
of
permanent
deprecation
with
their
backs
turned
as
it
were
to
the
north
stood
sparsely
on
the
plain
the
grass
did
not
look
good
to
eat
though
the
cossack
horses
would
no
doubt
have
liked
to
try
it
the
road
seemed
to
have
been
drawn
by
some
titan
engineer
with
a
ruler
from
horizon
to
horizon
away
to
the
south
there
was
a
forest
of
the
same
stunted
pines
where
a
few
and
eked
out
a
forlorn
and
obscure
existence
there
are
a
score
of
such
settlements
such
gloomy
forests
dotted
over
this
plain
of
tver
which
covers
an
area
of
nearly
two
hundred
square
miles
the
remainder
of
it
is
pasture
where
miserable
cattle
and
a
few
horses
many
sheep
and
countless
pigs
seek
their
food
pessimistically
from
god
steinmetz
looked
round
over
this
cheerless
prospect
with
a
twinkle
of
amused
resignation
in
his
blue
eyes
as
if
this
creation
were
a
little
practical
joke
which
he
karl
steinmetz
appreciated
at
its
proper
worth
the
whole
scene
was
suggestive
of
immense
distance
of
countless
miles
in
all
directions
a
suggestion
not
conveyed
by
any
scene
in
england
by
few
in
europe
in
our
crowded
island
we
have
no
conception
of
a
thousand
miles
how
can
we
few
of
us
have
travelled
five
hundred
at
a
stretch
the
land
through
which
these
men
were
riding
is
the
home
of
great
distances
russia
they
rode
moreover
as
if
they
knew
it
as
if
they
had
ridden
for
days
and
were
aware
of
more
days
in
front
of
them
the
companion
of
karl
steinmetz
looked
like
an
englishman
he
was
young
and
fair
and
quiet
he
looked
like
a
youthful
athlete
from
oxford
or
cambridge
a
person
who
had
jumped
higher
or
run
quicker
than
anybody
else
without
conceit
taking
himself
like
paul
as
he
found
himself
and
giving
the
credit
elsewhere
and
one
finds
that
after
all
in
this
world
of
deceit
we
are
most
of
us
that
which
we
look
like
you
madam
look
to
a
day
although
your
figure
is
still
youthful
your
hair
untouched
by
gray
your
face
unseamed
by
care
you
may
look
in
your
mirror
and
note
these
accidents
with
satisfaction
you
may
feel
young
and
indulge
in
the
pastimes
of
youth
without
effort
but
you
are
we
know
it
we
who
look
at
you
can
see
it
for
ourselves
and
if
you
could
only
be
brought
to
believe
it
we
think
no
worse
of
you
on
that
account
the
man
who
rode
beside
karl
steinmetz
with
gloomy
eyes
and
a
vague
suggestion
of
flight
in
his
whole
demeanor
was
like
reader
and
writer
exactly
what
he
seemed
he
was
the
product
of
an
english
public
school
and
university
he
was
moreover
a
modern
product
of
those
seats
of
athletic
exercise
he
had
little
education
and
highly
developed
muscles
that
is
to
say
he
was
no
scholar
but
essentially
a
gentleman
a
good
enough
education
in
its
way
and
long
may
britons
seek
it
this
young
man
name
was
paul
howard
alexis
and
fortune
had
made
him
a
russian
prince
if
however
anyone
even
steinmetz
called
him
prince
he
blushed
and
became
confused
this
terrible
title
had
brooded
over
him
while
at
eton
and
cambridge
but
no
one
had
found
him
out
he
remained
paul
howard
alexis
so
far
as
england
and
his
friends
were
concerned
in
russia
however
he
was
known
by
name
only
for
he
avoided
slavonic
society
as
prince
pavlo
alexis
this
plain
was
his
half
the
government
of
tver
was
his
the
great
volga
rolled
through
his
possessions
sixty
miles
behind
him
a
grim
stone
castle
bore
his
name
and
a
tract
of
land
as
vast
as
yorkshire
was
peopled
by
persons
who
cringed
at
the
mention
of
his
excellency
all
this
because
thirty
years
earlier
a
certain
princess
natásha
alexis
had
fallen
in
love
with
plain
howard
of
the
british
embassy
in
petersburg
with
slavonic
enthusiasm
for
the
russian
is
the
most
romantic
race
on
earth
she
informed
howard
of
the
fact
and
duly
married
him
both
these
persons
were
now
dead
and
paul
howard
alexis
owed
it
to
his
mother
influence
in
high
regions
that
the
responsibilities
of
princedom
were
his
at
the
time
when
this
title
was
accorded
to
him
he
had
no
say
in
the
matter
indeed
he
had
little
say
in
any
matters
except
meals
which
he
still
took
in
liquid
form
certain
it
is
however
that
he
failed
to
appreciate
his
honors
as
soon
as
he
grew
up
to
a
proper
comprehension
of
them
equally
certain
is
it
that
he
entirely
failed
to
recognize
the
enviability
of
his
position
as
he
rode
across
the
plains
of
tver
toward
the
yellow
volga
by
the
side
of
karl
steinmetz
this
is
great
nonsense
he
said
suddenly
i
feel
like
a
nihilist
or
some
theatrical
person
of
that
sort
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
necessary
steinmetz
not
necessary
answered
steinmetz
in
thick
guttural
tones
but
prudent
this
man
spoke
with
the
soft
consonants
of
a
german
prudent
my
dear
prince
oh
drop
that
when
we
sight
the
volga
i
will
drop
it
with
pleasure
good
heavens
i
wish
i
were
a
prince
i
should
have
it
marked
on
my
linen
and
sit
up
in
bed
to
read
it
on
my
nightshirt
no
you
would
steinmetz
answered
alexis
with
a
vexed
laugh
you
would
hate
it
just
as
much
as
i
do
especially
if
it
meant
running
away
from
the
best
in
europe
steinmetz
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
you
should
not
have
been
charitable
charity
i
tell
you
alexis
covers
no
sins
in
this
country
who
made
me
charitable
besides
no
fellow
could
be
anything
else
here
who
told
me
of
the
league
of
charity
i
should
like
to
know
who
put
me
into
it
who
aroused
my
pity
for
these
poor
beggars
who
but
a
stout
german
cynic
called
steinmetz
stout
yes
cynic
if
you
will
german
no
the
words
were
jerked
out
of
him
by
the
galloping
horse
then
what
are
you
steinmetz
looked
straight
in
front
of
him
with
a
meditation
in
his
quiet
eyes
which
made
a
dreamy
man
of
him
that
depends
alexis
laughed
yes
i
know
in
germany
you
are
a
german
in
russia
a
slav
in
poland
a
pole
and
in
england
any
thing
the
moment
suggests
exactly
so
but
to
return
to
you
you
must
trust
to
me
in
this
matter
i
know
this
country
i
know
what
this
league
of
charity
was
it
was
a
bigger
thing
than
any
dream
of
it
was
a
power
in
russia
the
greatest
of
all
above
nihilism
above
the
emperor
himself
ach
gott
it
was
a
wonderful
organization
spreading
over
this
country
like
sunlight
over
a
field
it
would
have
made
men
of
our
poor
peasants
it
was
god
work
if
there
is
a
god
bien
entendu
which
some
young
men
deny
because
god
fails
to
recognize
their
importance
i
imagine
and
now
it
is
all
done
it
is
crumbled
up
by
the
scurrilous
treachery
of
some
miscreant
ach
i
should
like
to
have
him
out
here
on
the
plain
i
would
choke
him
for
money
too
the
devil
it
must
have
been
the
devil
to
sell
that
secret
to
the
government
i
ca
see
what
the
government
wanted
it
for
growled
alexis
moodily
no
but
i
can
it
is
not
the
emperor
he
is
a
gentleman
although
he
has
the
misfortune
to
wear
the
purple
no
it
is
those
about
him
they
want
to
stop
education
they
want
to
crush
the
peasant
they
are
afraid
of
being
found
out
they
live
in
their
grand
houses
and
support
their
grand
names
on
the
money
they
crush
out
of
the
starving
peasant
so
do
i
so
far
as
that
goes
of
course
you
do
and
i
am
your
steward
your
crusher
we
do
not
deny
it
we
boast
of
it
but
we
exchange
a
wink
with
the
angels
eh
alexis
rode
on
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
he
sat
his
horse
as
english
foxhunters
do
not
prettily
and
the
little
animal
with
erect
head
and
scraggy
neck
was
evidently
worried
by
the
unusual
grip
on
his
ribs
for
russians
sit
back
with
a
short
stirrup
and
a
loose
seat
when
they
are
travelling
one
must
not
form
one
idea
of
russian
horsemanship
from
the
erect
carriage
affected
in
the
newski
prospect
i
wish
he
said
abruptly
that
i
had
never
attempted
to
do
any
good
doing
good
to
mankind
does
pay
here
i
am
running
away
from
my
own
home
as
if
i
were
afraid
of
the
police
the
position
is
impossible
steinmetz
shook
his
shaggy
head
no
no
position
is
impossible
in
this
country
except
the
czar
if
one
only
keeps
cool
for
men
such
as
you
and
i
any
position
is
quite
easy
but
these
russians
are
too
romantic
too
exaltés
they
give
way
to
a
morbid
love
of
martyrdom
they
think
they
can
do
no
good
to
mankind
unless
they
are
uncomfortable
alexis
turned
in
his
saddle
and
looked
keenly
into
his
companion
face
do
you
know
he
said
i
believe
you
founded
the
charity
league
steinmetz
laughed
in
his
easy
stout
way
it
founded
itself
he
said
the
angels
founded
it
in
heaven
i
hope
a
committee
of
them
will
attend
to
the
eternal
misery
of
the
dog
who
betrayed
it
i
trust
they
will
but
in
the
meantime
i
stick
to
my
opinion
that
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
leave
the
country
what
have
i
done
i
do
not
belong
to
the
league
it
is
composed
entirely
of
russian
nobles
i
admit
that
i
am
a
russian
noble
but
persisted
steinmetz
quietly
you
subscribe
to
the
league
four
hundred
thousand
rubles
they
do
not
grow
at
the
roadside
but
the
rubles
have
not
my
name
on
them
that
may
be
but
we
all
know
where
they
are
likely
to
come
from
my
dear
paul
you
can
not
keep
up
the
farce
any
longer
you
are
not
an
english
gentleman
who
comes
across
here
for
sporting
purposes
you
do
not
live
in
the
old
castle
of
osterno
three
months
in
the
year
because
you
have
a
taste
for
mediaeval
fortresses
you
are
a
russian
prince
and
your
estates
are
the
happiest
the
most
enlightened
in
the
empire
that
alone
is
suspicious
you
collect
your
rents
yourself
you
have
no
german
agents
no
german
vampires
about
you
there
are
a
thousand
things
suspicious
about
prince
pavlo
alexis
if
those
that
be
in
high
places
only
come
to
think
about
it
they
have
not
come
to
think
about
it
thanks
to
our
care
and
to
your
english
independence
but
that
is
only
another
reason
why
we
should
redouble
our
care
you
must
not
be
in
russia
when
the
charity
league
is
picked
to
pieces
there
will
be
trouble
half
the
nobility
in
russia
will
be
in
it
there
will
be
confiscations
and
degradations
there
will
be
imprisonment
and
siberia
for
some
you
are
better
out
of
it
for
you
are
not
an
englishman
you
have
not
even
a
foreign
office
passport
your
passport
is
your
patent
of
nobility
and
that
is
russian
no
you
are
better
out
of
it
and
you
what
about
you
asked
paul
with
a
little
laugh
the
laugh
that
one
brave
man
gives
when
he
sees
another
do
a
plucky
thing
i
oh
i
am
all
right
i
am
nobody
i
am
hated
of
all
the
peasants
because
i
am
your
steward
and
so
hard
so
cruel
that
is
my
certificate
of
harmlessness
with
those
that
are
about
the
emperor
paul
made
no
answer
he
was
not
of
an
argumentative
mind
being
a
large
man
and
consequently
inclined
to
the
sins
of
omission
rather
than
to
the
active
form
of
doing
wrong
he
had
an
enormous
faith
in
karl
steinmetz
and
indeed
no
man
knew
russia
better
than
this
cosmopolitan
adventurer
steinmetz
it
was
who
pricked
forward
with
all
speed
wearing
his
hardy
little
horse
to
a
drooping
semblance
of
its
former
self
steinmetz
it
was
who
had
recommended
quitting
the
travelling
carriage
and
taking
to
the
saddle
although
his
own
bulk
led
him
to
prefer
the
slower
and
more
comfortable
method
of
covering
space
it
would
almost
seem
that
he
doubted
his
own
ascendency
over
his
companion
and
master
which
semblance
was
further
increased
by
a
subtle
ring
of
anxiety
in
his
voice
while
he
argued
it
is
possible
that
karl
steinmetz
suspected
the
late
princess
natásha
of
having
transmitted
to
her
son
a
small
hereditary
portion
of
that
slavonic
exaltation
and
recklessness
of
consequence
which
he
deplored
then
you
turn
back
at
tver
enquired
paul
at
length
breaking
a
long
silence
yes
i
must
not
leave
osterno
just
now
perhaps
later
when
the
winter
has
come
i
will
follow
russia
is
quiet
during
the
winter
very
quiet
ha
ha
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
shivered
but
the
shiver
was
interrupted
he
raised
himself
in
his
saddle
and
peered
forward
into
the
gathering
darkness
what
is
that
he
asked
sharply
on
the
road
in
front
paul
had
already
seen
it
it
looks
like
a
horse
he
answered
a
strayed
horse
for
it
has
no
rider
they
were
going
west
and
what
little
daylight
there
was
lived
on
the
western
horizon
the
form
of
the
horse
cut
out
in
black
relief
against
the
sky
was
weird
and
ghostlike
it
was
standing
by
the
side
of
the
road
apparently
grazing
as
they
approached
it
its
outlines
became
more
defined
it
has
a
saddle
said
steinmetz
at
length
what
have
we
here
the
beast
was
evidently
famishing
for
as
they
came
near
it
never
ceased
its
occupation
of
dragging
the
wizened
tufts
of
grass
up
root
and
all
what
have
we
here
repeated
steinmetz
and
the
two
men
clapped
spurs
to
their
tired
horses
the
solitary
waif
had
a
rider
but
he
was
not
in
the
saddle
one
foot
was
caught
in
the
stirrup
and
as
the
horse
moved
on
from
tuft
to
tuft
it
dragged
its
dead
master
along
the
ground
chapter
ii
by
the
volga
this
is
going
to
be
unpleasant
muttered
steinmetz
as
he
cumbrously
left
the
saddle
that
man
is
dead
has
been
dead
some
days
he
stiff
and
the
horse
has
been
dragging
him
face
downward
god
in
heaven
this
will
be
unpleasant
paul
had
leaped
to
the
ground
and
was
already
loosening
the
dead
foot
from
the
stirrup
he
did
it
with
a
certain
sort
of
skill
despite
the
stiffness
of
the
heavy
as
if
he
had
walked
a
hospital
in
his
time
very
quickly
steinmetz
came
to
his
assistance
tenderly
lifting
the
dead
man
and
laying
him
on
his
back
ach
he
exclaimed
we
are
unfortunate
to
meet
a
thing
like
this
there
was
no
need
of
paul
alexis
medical
skill
to
tell
that
this
man
was
dead
a
child
would
have
known
it
before
searching
the
pockets
steinmetz
took
out
his
own
handkerchief
and
laid
it
over
a
face
which
had
become
unrecognizable
the
horse
was
standing
over
them
it
bent
its
head
and
sniffed
wonderingly
at
that
which
had
once
been
its
master
there
was
a
singular
scared
look
in
its
eyes
steinmetz
pushed
aside
the
enquiring
muzzle
if
you
could
speak
my
friend
he
said
we
might
want
you
as
it
is
you
had
better
continue
your
meal
paul
was
unbuttoning
the
dead
man
clothes
he
inserted
his
hand
within
the
rough
shirt
this
man
he
said
was
starving
he
probably
fainted
from
sheer
exhaustion
and
rolled
out
of
the
saddle
it
is
hunger
that
killed
him
with
his
pocket
full
of
money
added
steinmetz
withdrawing
his
hand
from
the
dead
man
pocket
and
displaying
a
bundle
of
notes
and
some
silver
there
was
nothing
in
any
of
the
other
pockets
no
paper
no
clue
of
any
sort
to
the
man
identity
the
two
finders
of
this
silent
tragedy
stood
up
and
looked
around
them
it
was
almost
dark
they
were
ten
miles
from
a
habitation
it
does
not
sound
much
but
a
traveller
would
be
hard
put
to
place
ten
miles
between
himself
and
a
habitation
in
the
whole
of
the
british
islands
this
added
to
a
lack
of
road
or
path
which
is
unknown
to
us
in
england
made
ten
miles
of
some
importance
steinmetz
had
pushed
his
fur
cap
to
the
back
of
his
head
which
he
was
scratching
pensively
he
had
a
habit
of
scratching
his
forehead
with
one
finger
which
denoted
thought
now
what
are
we
to
do
he
muttered
ca
bury
the
poor
chap
and
say
nothing
about
it
i
wonder
where
his
passport
is
we
have
here
a
tragedy
he
turned
to
the
horse
which
was
grazing
hurriedly
my
friend
of
the
four
legs
he
said
it
is
a
thousand
pities
that
you
are
dumb
paul
was
still
examining
the
dead
man
with
that
callousness
which
denotes
one
who
for
love
or
convenience
has
become
a
doctor
he
was
a
doctor
an
amateur
he
was
a
caius
man
steinmetz
looked
down
at
him
with
a
little
laugh
he
noticed
the
tenderness
of
the
touch
the
deft
fingering
which
had
something
of
respect
in
it
paul
alexis
was
visibly
one
of
those
men
who
take
mankind
seriously
and
have
that
in
their
hearts
which
for
want
of
a
better
word
we
call
sympathy
mind
you
do
not
catch
some
infectious
disease
said
steinmetz
gruffly
i
should
not
care
to
handle
any
stray
moujik
one
finds
dead
about
the
roadside
unless
of
course
you
think
there
is
more
money
about
him
it
would
be
a
pity
to
leave
that
for
the
police
paul
did
not
answer
he
was
examining
the
limp
dirty
hands
of
the
dead
man
the
fingers
were
covered
with
soil
the
nails
were
broken
he
had
evidently
clutched
at
the
earth
and
at
every
tuft
of
grass
after
his
fall
from
the
saddle
look
here
at
these
hands
said
paul
suddenly
this
is
an
englishman
you
never
see
fingers
this
shape
in
russia
steinmetz
stooped
down
he
held
out
his
own
fingers
in
comparison
paul
rubbed
the
dead
hand
with
his
sleeve
as
if
it
were
a
piece
of
statuary
look
here
he
continued
the
dirt
rubs
off
and
leaves
the
hand
quite
a
gentlemanly
color
this
he
paused
and
lifted
handkerchief
dropping
it
again
hurriedly
over
the
mutilated
face
this
thing
was
once
a
gentleman
it
certainly
has
seen
better
days
admitted
steinmetz
with
a
grim
humor
which
was
sometimes
his
come
let
us
drag
him
beneath
that
and
ride
on
to
tver
we
shall
do
no
good
my
dear
alexis
wasting
our
time
over
the
possible
antecedents
of
a
gentleman
who
for
reasons
of
his
own
is
silent
on
the
subject
paul
rose
from
the
ground
his
movements
were
those
of
a
strong
and
supple
man
one
whose
muscles
had
never
had
time
to
grow
stiff
he
was
an
active
man
who
never
hurried
standing
thus
upright
he
was
very
tall
nearly
a
giant
only
in
petersburg
of
all
the
cities
of
the
world
could
he
expect
to
pass
unnoticed
the
city
of
tall
men
and
plain
women
he
rubbed
his
two
hands
together
in
a
singularly
professional
manner
which
sat
amiss
on
him
what
do
you
propose
doing
he
asked
you
know
the
laws
of
this
country
better
than
i
do
steinmetz
scratched
his
forehead
with
his
forefinger
our
theatrical
friends
the
police
he
said
are
going
to
enjoy
this
suppose
we
prop
him
up
sitting
against
that
tree
no
one
will
run
away
with
him
and
lead
his
horse
into
tver
i
will
give
notice
to
the
police
but
i
will
not
do
so
until
you
are
in
the
petersburg
train
i
will
of
course
give
the
ispravnik
to
understand
that
your
princely
mind
could
not
be
bothered
by
such
details
as
this
that
you
have
proceeded
on
your
journey
i
do
not
like
leaving
the
poor
beggar
alone
all
night
said
paul
there
may
be
wolves
the
crows
in
the
early
morning
bah
that
is
because
you
are
so
my
dear
fellow
what
business
is
it
of
ours
if
the
universal
laws
of
nature
are
illustrated
upon
this
unpleasant
object
we
all
live
on
each
other
the
wolves
and
the
crows
have
the
last
word
tant
mieux
for
the
wolves
and
the
crows
come
let
us
carry
him
to
that
tree
the
moon
was
just
rising
over
the
line
of
the
horizon
all
around
them
the
steppe
lay
in
grim
and
lifeless
silence
in
such
a
scene
where
life
seemed
rare
and
precious
death
gained
in
its
power
of
inspiring
fear
it
is
different
in
crowded
cities
where
an
excess
of
human
life
seems
to
vouch
for
the
continuity
of
the
race
where
in
a
teeming
population
one
life
more
or
less
seems
of
little
value
the
rosy
hue
of
sunset
was
fading
to
a
clear
green
and
in
the
midst
of
a
cloudless
sky
jupiter
very
near
the
earth
at
that
time
shone
intense
and
brilliant
like
a
lamp
it
was
an
evening
such
as
only
russia
and
the
great
north
lands
ever
see
where
the
sunset
is
almost
in
the
north
and
the
sunrise
holds
it
by
the
hand
over
the
whole
scene
there
hung
a
clear
transparent
night
green
and
shimmering
which
would
never
be
darker
than
an
english
twilight
the
two
living
men
carried
the
nameless
unrecognizable
dead
to
a
beneath
a
stunted
pine
a
few
paces
removed
from
the
road
they
laid
him
decently
at
full
length
crossing
his
hands
over
his
breast
tying
the
handkerchief
down
over
his
face
then
they
turned
and
left
him
alone
in
that
luminous
night
a
waif
that
had
fallen
by
the
great
highway
without
a
word
without
a
sign
a
race
a
story
cut
off
in
the
middle
for
he
was
a
young
man
still
his
hair
all
dusty
draggled
and
bloodstained
had
no
streak
of
gray
his
hands
were
smooth
and
youthful
there
was
a
vague
suspicion
of
sensual
softness
about
his
body
as
if
this
might
have
been
a
man
who
loved
comfort
and
ease
who
had
always
chosen
the
primrose
path
had
never
learned
the
salutary
lesson
of
the
incipient
stoutness
of
limb
contrasted
strangely
with
the
drawn
meagreness
of
his
body
which
was
contracted
by
want
of
food
paul
alexis
was
right
this
man
had
died
of
starvation
within
ten
miles
of
the
great
volga
within
nine
miles
of
the
outskirts
of
tver
a
city
second
to
moscow
and
once
her
rival
therefore
it
could
only
be
that
he
had
purposely
avoided
the
dwellings
of
men
that
he
was
a
fugitive
of
some
sort
or
another
theory
that
this
was
an
englishman
had
not
been
received
with
enthusiasm
by
steinmetz
but
that
philosopher
had
stooped
to
inspect
the
narrow
fingers
steinmetz
be
it
noted
had
an
infinite
capacity
for
holding
his
tongue
they
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
away
without
looking
back
but
they
did
not
speak
as
if
each
were
deep
in
his
own
thoughts
material
had
indeed
been
afforded
them
for
who
could
tell
who
this
featureless
man
might
be
they
were
left
in
a
state
of
hopeless
curiosity
as
who
having
picked
up
a
page
with
finis
written
upon
it
falls
to
wondering
what
the
story
may
have
been
steinmetz
had
thrown
the
bridle
of
the
straying
horse
over
his
arm
and
the
animal
trotted
obediently
by
the
side
of
the
fidgety
little
cossacks
that
was
bad
luck
exclaimed
the
elder
man
at
length
d
d
bad
luck
in
this
country
the
less
you
find
the
less
you
see
the
less
you
understand
the
simpler
is
your
existence
those
nihilists
with
their
mysterious
ways
and
their
reprehensible
love
of
explosives
have
made
honest
men
lives
a
burden
to
them
their
motives
were
originally
good
put
in
paul
that
is
possible
but
a
good
motive
is
no
excuse
for
a
bad
means
they
wanted
to
get
along
too
quickly
they
are
exalted
unpractical
to
a
man
i
do
not
mention
the
women
because
when
women
meddle
in
politics
they
make
fools
of
themselves
even
in
england
these
nihilists
would
have
been
all
very
well
if
they
had
been
content
to
sow
for
posterity
but
they
wanted
to
see
the
fruits
of
their
labors
in
one
generation
education
does
not
grow
like
that
it
requires
a
couple
of
generations
to
germinate
it
has
to
be
manured
by
the
brains
of
fools
before
it
is
of
any
use
in
england
it
has
reached
this
stage
here
in
russia
the
sowing
has
only
begun
now
we
were
doing
some
good
the
charity
league
was
the
thing
it
began
by
training
their
starved
bodies
to
be
ready
for
the
education
when
it
came
and
very
little
of
it
would
have
come
in
our
time
if
you
educate
a
hungry
man
you
set
a
devil
loose
upon
the
world
fill
their
stomachs
before
you
feed
their
brains
or
you
will
give
them
mental
indigestion
and
a
man
with
mental
indigestion
raises
hell
or
cuts
his
own
throat
that
is
just
what
i
want
to
do
fill
their
stomachs
i
do
care
about
the
rest
i
not
responsible
for
the
progress
of
the
world
or
the
good
of
humanity
said
paul
he
rode
on
in
silence
then
he
burst
out
again
in
the
curt
phraseology
of
a
man
whose
feeling
is
stronger
than
he
cares
to
admit
i
got
no
grand
ideas
about
the
human
race
he
said
a
very
little
contents
me
a
little
piece
of
tver
a
few
thousand
peasants
are
good
enough
for
me
it
seems
rather
hard
that
a
fellow
ca
give
away
of
his
surplus
money
in
charity
if
he
is
such
a
fool
as
to
want
to
steinmetz
was
riding
stubbornly
along
suddenly
he
gave
a
little
chuckle
a
guttural
sound
expressive
of
a
somewhat
germanic
satisfaction
i
do
see
how
they
can
stop
us
he
said
the
league
of
course
is
done
it
will
crumble
away
in
sheer
panic
but
here
in
tver
they
can
not
stop
us
he
clapped
his
great
hand
on
his
thigh
with
more
glee
than
one
would
have
expected
him
to
feel
for
this
man
posed
as
a
cynic
a
despiser
of
men
a
scoffer
at
charity
they
find
it
very
difficult
to
stop
me
muttered
paul
alexis
it
was
now
dark
as
dark
as
ever
it
would
be
steinmetz
peered
through
the
gloom
toward
him
with
a
little
laugh
half
tolerance
half
admiration
the
country
was
here
a
little
more
broken
long
low
hills
like
vast
waves
rose
and
fell
beneath
the
horses
feet
ages
ago
the
volga
may
have
been
here
and
slowly
narrowing
must
have
left
these
hills
in
deposit
from
the
crest
of
an
incline
the
horsemen
looked
down
over
a
vast
rolling
tableland
and
far
ahead
of
them
a
great
white
streak
bounded
the
horizon
the
volga
said
steinmetz
we
are
almost
there
and
there
to
the
right
is
the
tversha
it
is
like
a
great
catapult
gott
what
a
wonderful
night
no
wonder
these
russians
are
romantic
what
a
night
for
a
pipe
and
a
long
chair
this
horse
of
mine
is
tired
he
shakes
me
most
abominably
like
to
change
enquired
paul
curtly
no
it
would
make
no
difference
you
are
as
heavy
as
i
although
i
am
wider
ah
there
are
the
lights
of
tver
ahead
of
them
a
few
lights
twinkled
feebly
sometimes
visible
and
then
hidden
again
as
they
rode
over
the
rolling
hillocks
one
plain
ever
suggests
another
but
the
resemblance
between
the
steppes
of
tver
and
the
great
sahara
is
at
times
startling
there
is
in
both
that
roll
as
of
the
sea
the
great
roll
that
heaves
unceasingly
round
the
capes
of
good
hope
and
horn
looked
at
casually
tver
and
sahara
plains
are
level
and
it
is
only
in
crossing
them
that
one
realizes
the
gentle
up
and
down
beneath
the
horses
feet
soon
steinmetz
raised
his
head
and
sniffed
in
a
loud
teutonic
manner
it
was
the
reek
of
water
for
great
rivers
like
the
ocean
have
their
smell
and
the
volga
is
a
revelation
men
travel
far
to
see
a
city
but
few
seem
curious
about
a
river
every
river
has
nevertheless
its
individuality
its
great
silent
interest
every
river
has
moreover
its
influence
which
extends
to
the
people
who
pass
their
lives
within
sight
of
its
waters
thus
the
guadalquivir
is
rapid
mysterious
untrammelled
breaking
frequently
from
its
boundary
and
it
runs
through
andalusia
the
nile
the
river
of
ages
runs
clear
untroubled
through
the
centuries
between
banks
untouched
by
man
the
rhine
romantic
cultivated
artificial
with
a
rough
subcurrent
and
a
muddy
bed
through
germany
the
seine
and
the
thames
shallow
shallow
shallow
and
we
who
live
upon
their
banks
the
volga
immense
stupendous
a
great
power
an
influence
two
thousand
four
hundred
miles
long
some
have
seen
the
danube
and
think
they
have
seen
a
great
river
so
they
have
but
the
russian
giant
is
seven
hundred
miles
longer
a
vast
yellow
stream
moving
on
to
the
distant
sea
slow
gentle
inexorable
overwhelming
all
great
things
in
nature
have
the
power
of
crushing
the
human
intellect
russians
are
thus
crushed
by
the
vastness
of
their
country
of
their
rivers
man
is
but
a
small
thing
in
a
great
country
and
those
who
live
by
nile
or
guadalquivir
or
volga
seem
to
hold
their
lives
on
condition
they
exist
from
day
to
day
by
the
tolerance
of
their
river
steinmetz
and
paul
paused
for
a
moment
on
the
wooden
floating
bridge
and
looked
at
the
great
river
all
who
cross
that
bridge
or
the
railway
bridge
higher
up
the
stream
must
do
the
same
they
pause
and
draw
a
deep
breath
as
if
in
the
presence
of
something
supernatural
they
rode
on
without
speaking
through
the
squalid
town
the
whilom
rival
and
the
victim
of
brilliant
moscow
they
rode
straight
to
the
station
where
they
dined
in
by
the
way
one
of
the
best
railway
refreshment
rooms
in
the
world
at
one
the
night
express
from
moscow
to
petersburg
with
its
huge
american
locomotive
rumbled
into
the
station
paul
secured
a
chair
in
the
long
saloon
car
and
then
returned
to
the
platform
the
train
waited
twenty
minutes
for
refreshments
and
he
still
had
much
to
say
to
steinmetz
for
one
of
these
men
owned
a
principality
and
the
other
governed
it
they
walked
up
and
down
the
long
platform
smoking
endless
cigarettes
talking
gravely
steinmetz
stood
on
the
platform
and
watched
the
train
pass
slowly
away
into
the
night
then
he
went
toward
a
lamp
and
taking
a
from
his
pocket
examined
each
corner
of
it
in
succession
it
was
a
small
of
fine
cambric
in
one
corner
were
the
initials
worked
neatly
in
white
such
embroidery
as
is
done
in
petersburg
ach
exclaimed
steinmetz
shortly
something
told
me
that
that
was
he
he
turned
the
little
piece
of
cambric
over
and
over
examining
it
slowly
with
a
heavy
germanic
cunning
he
had
taken
this
handkerchief
from
the
body
of
the
nameless
rider
who
was
now
lying
alone
on
the
steppe
twelve
miles
away
steinmetz
returned
to
the
large
refreshment
room
and
ordered
the
waiter
to
bring
him
a
glass
of
benedictine
which
he
drank
slowly
and
thoughtfully
then
he
went
toward
the
large
black
stove
which
stands
in
the
railway
restaurant
at
tver
he
opened
the
door
with
the
point
of
his
boot
the
wood
was
roaring
and
crackling
within
he
threw
the
handkerchief
in
and
closed
the
door
it
is
as
well

prince
he
muttered
that

claude
de
chauxville
had
said
to
a
lady
earlier
in
the
evening
apropos
of
the
great
gathering
at
the
french
embassy
and
the
mot
had
gone
the
round
of
the
room
in
society
a
little
mot
will
go
a
long
way
le
baron
de
chauxville
was
moreover
a
manufacturer
of
mots
by
calling
he
was
attaché
to
the
french
embassy
in
london
by
profession
he
was
an
epigrammatist
that
is
to
say
he
was
a
sort
of
social
revolver
he
went
off
if
one
touched
him
conversationally
and
like
others
among
us
he
frequently
missed
fire
of
course
he
had
but
little
real
respect
for
the
truth
if
one
wishes
to
be
epigrammatic
one
must
relinquish
the
hope
of
being
either
agreeable
or
veracious
de
chauxville
did
not
really
intend
to
convey
the
idea
that
any
of
the
persons
assembled
in
the
great
guest
chambers
of
the
french
embassy
that
evening
were
anything
but
what
they
seemed
he
could
not
surely
imagine
that
lady
mealhead
the
beautiful
spouse
of
the
seventh
earl
mealhead
was
anything
but
what
she
seemed
namely
a
great
lady
of
course
de
chauxville
knew
that
lady
mealhead
had
once
been
the
darling
of
the
and
that
a
thousand
hearts
had
vociferously
gone
out
to
her
from
sixpenny
and
even
threepenny
galleries
when
she
answered
to
the
name
of
tiny
smalltoes
but
then
de
chauxville
knew
as
well
as
you
and
i
lady
mealhead
no
doubt
had
told
him
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
clergyman
and
had
chosen
the
stage
in
preference
to
the
as
a
means
of
supporting
her
aged
mother
whether
de
chauxville
believed
this
or
not
it
is
not
for
us
to
enquire
he
certainly
looked
as
if
he
believed
it
when
lady
mealhead
told
him
and
his
expressive
gallic
eyes
waxed
tender
at
the
mention
of
her
mother
the
relict
of
the
late
clergyman
whose
name
had
somehow
been
overlooked
by
crockford
a
frenchman
loves
his
mother
in
the
abstract
nor
could
de
chauxville
take
exception
at
young
cyril
squyrt
the
poet
cyril
looked
like
a
poet
he
wore
his
hair
over
his
collar
at
the
back
and
below
the
in
front
and
moreover
he
was
a
poet
one
of
those
who
write
for
ages
yet
unborn
besides
his
poems
could
be
bought
of
the
publisher
only
the
railway
bookstall
men
did
not
understand
them
beautifully
bound
really
beautifully
bound
in
white
kid
with
green
ribbon
a
very
thin
volume
and
very
thin
poetry
meddlesome
persons
have
been
known
to
state
that
cyril
squyrt
father
kept
a
prosperous
shop
in
leeds
but
one
must
not
always
believe
all
that
one
hears
it
appears
that
beneath
the
turf
or
on
it
all
men
are
equal
so
no
one
could
object
to
the
presence
of
billy
bale
the
man
by
gad
who
could
give
you
the
straight
tip
on
any
race
and
looked
like
it
we
all
know
bale

the
same
being
billy
father
but
no
matter
billy
wears
the
best
cut
in

and
let
me
tell
you
there
are
many
folk
in
society
with
a
smaller
recommendation
than
that
now
it
is
not
our
business
to
go
round
the
rooms
of
the
french
embassy
picking
holes
in
the
earthly
robes
of
society
elect
suffice
it
to
say
that
every
one
was
there
miss
kate
whyte
of
course
who
had
made
a
place
in
society
and
held
it
by
the
indecency
of
her
language
lady
mealhead
said
she
could
stand
kitty
whyte
at
any
price
we
are
sorry
to
use
such
a
word
as
indecency
in
connection
with
a
young
person
of
the
gentler
sex
but
facts
must
sometimes
be
recognized
and
it
is
a
bare
fact
that
society
tolerated
nay
encouraged
kitty
whyte
because
society
never
knew
and
always
wanted
to
know
what
she
would
say
next
she
sailed
so
near
to
the
unsteady
breeze
of
decorum
that
the
craft
hung
breathlessly
in
her
wake
in
the
hope
of
an
upset
every
one
in
fact
was
there
all
those
who
have
had
greatness
thrust
upon
them
and
the
others
those
who
thrust
themselves
upon
the
great
those
in
a
word
who
reach
such
as
are
above
them
by
doing
that
which
should
be
beneath
them
lord
mealhead
by
the
way
was
not
there
he
never
is
anywhere
where
the
respectable
writer
and
his
reader
are
to
be
found
it
is
discreet
not
to
enquire
where
lord
mealhead
is
especially
of
lady
mealhead
who
has
severed
more
completely
her
connection
with
the
past
his
lordship
is
perchance
of
a
sentimental
humor
and
loves
to
wander
in
those
pasteboard
groves
where
first
he
met
his
tiny
and
very
natural
too
there
was
music
and
the
refreshments
it
was
in
fact
a
reception
gaul
most
lively
sons
bowed
before
albion
fairest
daughters
and
displayed
that
fund
of
verve
and
esprit
which
they
rightly
pride
themselves
upon
possessing
and
which
of
course
leave
mere
englishmen
so
far
behind
in
the
paths
of
love
and
chivalry
when
not
thus
actively
engaged
they
whispered
together
in
corners
and
nudged
each
other
exchanging
muttered
comments
in
which
the
word
charmante
came
conveniently
to
the
fore
thus
the
lightsome
son
of
republican
gaul
in
society
it
is
however
high
time
to
explain
the
reason
of
our
own
presence
of
our
own
reception
by
france
courteous
representative
we
are
here
to
meet
sydney
bamborough
and
moreover
to
confine
our
attention
to
the
persons
more
or
less
implicated
in
the
present
history
sydney
bamborough
was
undoubtedly
the
belle
of
the
evening
she
had
only
to
look
in
one
of
the
many
mirrors
to
make
sure
of
that
fact
and
if
she
wanted
further
assurance
a
hundred
men
in
the
room
would
have
been
ready
to
swear
to
it
this
lady
had
recently
dawned
on
london
society
a
young
widow
she
rarely
mentioned
her
husband
it
was
understood
to
be
a
painful
subject
he
had
been
attached
to
several
embassies
she
said
he
had
a
brilliant
career
before
him
and
suddenly
he
had
died
abroad
and
then
she
gave
a
little
sigh
and
a
bright
smile
which
being
interpreted
meant
let
us
change
the
subject
there
was
never
any
doubt
about
sydney
bamborough
she
was
aristocratic
to
the
tips
of
her
dainty
white
fingers
composed
gentle
and
quite
sure
of
herself
quite
the
grand
lady
as
lady
mealhead
said
but
sydney
bamborough
did
not
know
lady
mealhead
which
may
have
accounted
for
the
titled
woman
little
sniff
of
interrogation
as
a
matter
of
fact
etta
sydney
bamborough
came
from
excellent
ancestry
and
could
claim
an
uncle
here
a
cousin
there
and
a
number
of
distant
relatives
everywhere
should
it
be
worth
the
while
it
was
safe
to
presume
that
she
was
rich
from
the
manner
in
which
she
dressed
the
number
of
servants
and
horses
she
kept
the
general
air
of
wealth
which
pervaded
her
existence
that
she
was
beautiful
any
one
could
see
for
himself
not
in
the
among
the
presumably
types
of
english
beauty
but
in
the
proper
place
namely
in
her
own
and
other
aristocratic
she
was
talking
to
a
tall
fair
frenchman
in
perfect
french
and
was
herself
nearly
as
tall
as
he
bright
brown
hair
waved
prettily
back
from
a
white
forehead
clever
dark
gray
eyes
and
a
lovely
complexion
one
of
those
complexions
which
from
a
purity
of
conscience
or
a
steadiness
of
nerve
never
change
cheeks
of
a
faint
pink
an
expressive
mobile
mouth
a
neck
of
dazzling
white
such
was
sydney
bamborough
in
the
prime
of
her
youth
and
you
maintain
that
it
is
five
years
since
we
met
she
was
saying
to
the
tall
frenchman
have
i
not
counted
every
day
he
replied
i
do
not
know
she
answered
with
a
little
laugh
that
little
laugh
which
tells
wise
men
where
flattery
may
be
shot
like
so
much
conversational
rubbish
some
women
are
fathomless
pits
the
rubbish
never
seems
to
fill
them
i
do
not
know
but
i
should
not
think
so
well
madam
it
is
so
witness
these
gray
hairs
ah
those
were
happy
days
in
st
petersburg
sydney
bamborough
smiled
a
pleasant
society
smile
not
too
pronounced
and
just
sufficient
to
suggest
pearly
teeth
at
the
mention
of
petersburg
she
glanced
round
to
see
that
they
were
not
overheard
she
gave
a
little
shiver
do
speak
of
russia
she
pleaded
i
hate
to
hear
it
mentioned
i
was
so
happy
it
is
painful
to
remember
even
while
she
spoke
the
expression
of
her
face
changed
to
one
of
gay
delight
she
nodded
and
smiled
toward
a
tall
man
who
was
evidently
looking
for
her
and
took
no
notice
of
the
frenchman
apologies
who
that
asked
the
young
man
i
see
him
everywhere
lately
a
mere
english
gentleman
paul
howard
alexis
replied
the
lady
the
frenchman
raised
his
eyebrows
he
knew
better
this
was
no
plain
english
gentleman
he
bowed
and
took
his
leave
de
chauxville
of
the
french
embassy
was
watching
every
movement
every
change
of
expression
from
across
the
room
in
evening
dress
the
man
whom
we
last
saw
on
the
platform
of
the
railway
station
at
tver
did
not
look
so
unmistakably
english
it
was
more
evident
that
he
had
inherited
certain
characteristics
from
his
russian
mother
notably
his
great
height
a
physical
advantage
enjoyed
by
many
aristocratic
russian
families
his
hair
was
fair
and
inclined
to
curl
and
there
the
foreign
suggestion
suddenly
ceased
his
face
had
the
quiet
concentration
the
unobtrusive
which
one
sees
more
strongly
marked
in
english
faces
than
in
any
others
his
manner
of
moving
through
the
crowd
somewhat
belied
the
tan
of
his
skin
here
was
an
athletic
youth
who
knew
how
to
move
in
a
big
man
who
did
not
look
much
too
large
for
his
surroundings
it
was
evident
that
he
did
not
know
many
people
and
also
that
he
was
indifferent
to
his
loss
he
had
come
to
see
sydney
bamborough
and
that
lady
was
not
insensible
to
the
fact
to
prove
this
she
diverged
from
the
path
of
veracity
as
is
the
way
of
some
women
i
did
not
expect
to
see
you
here
she
said
you
told
me
you
were
coming
he
answered
simply
the
inference
would
have
been
enough
for
some
women
but
not
for
etta
sydney
bamborough
well
is
that
a
reason
why
you
should
attend
a
diplomatic
soirée
and
force
yourself
to
bow
and
smirk
to
a
number
of
little
dandies
whom
you
despise
the
best
reason
he
answered
quietly
with
an
honesty
which
somehow
touched
her
as
nothing
else
had
touched
this
beautiful
woman
since
she
had
become
aware
of
her
beauty
then
you
think
it
worth
the
bowing
and
the
smirking
she
asked
looking
past
him
with
innocent
eyes
she
made
an
imperceptible
little
movement
toward
him
as
if
she
expected
him
to
whisper
she
was
of
that
school
but
he
was
not
his
was
not
the
sort
of
mind
to
conceive
any
thought
that
required
whispering
some
persons
in
fact
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
was
hopelessly
dull
that
he
had
no
subtlety
of
thought
no
brightness
no
conversation
these
persons
were
no
doubt
ladies
upon
whom
he
had
failed
to
lavish
the
exceedingly
small
change
of
compliment
it
is
worth
that
and
more
he
replied
with
his
ready
smile
after
all
bowing
and
smirking
come
very
easily
one
soon
gets
accustomed
to
it
one
has
to
she
replied
with
a
little
sigh
especially
if
one
is
a
woman
which
little
mishap
comes
to
some
of
us
you
know
i
wonder
if
you
could
find
me
a
chair
she
was
standing
with
her
back
to
a
small
sofa
capable
of
holding
three
but
calculated
to
accommodate
two
she
did
not
of
course
see
it
in
fact
she
looked
everywhere
but
toward
it
raising
her
perfectly
gloved
fingers
tentatively
for
his
arm
i
am
tired
of
standing
she
added
he
turned
and
indicated
the
sofa
toward
which
she
immediately
advanced
as
she
sat
down
he
noted
vaguely
that
she
was
exquisitely
dressed
certainly
one
of
the
best
dressed
women
in
the
room
her
costume
was
daring
without
being
startling
being
merely
black
and
white
largely
boldly
contrasted
he
felt
indefinitely
proud
of
the
dress
some
instinct
in
the
man
simple
strong
mind
told
him
that
it
was
good
for
women
to
be
beautiful
but
his
ignorance
of
the
sex
being
profound
he
had
no
desire
to
analyze
the
beauty
he
had
no
mental
reservation
with
regard
to
her
indeed
it
would
have
been
hard
to
find
fault
with
etta
sydney
bamborough
looking
upon
her
merely
as
a
beautiful
woman
exquisitely
dressed
in
a
cynical
age
this
man
was
without
cynicism
he
did
not
dream
of
reflecting
that
the
lovely
hair
owed
half
its
beauty
to
the
clever
handling
of
a
maid
that
the
perfect
dress
had
been
the
topic
of
many
of
its
wearer
leisure
hours
he
was
in
fact
young
for
his
years
and
what
is
youth
but
a
happy
ignorance
it
is
only
when
we
know
too
much
that
gravity
marks
us
for
her
own
sydney
bamborough
looked
up
at
him
with
a
certain
admiration
this
man
was
like
a
mountain
breeze
to
one
who
has
breathed
nothing
but
the
faded
air
of
she
drew
in
her
train
with
a
pretty
curve
of
her
gloved
wrist
you
look
as
if
you
did
not
know
what
it
was
to
be
tired
but
perhaps
you
will
sit
down
i
can
make
room
he
accepted
with
alacrity
and
now
she
said
let
me
hear
where
you
have
been
i
have
only
had
time
to
shake
hands
with
you
the
last
twice
that
we
have
met
you
said
you
had
been
away
yes
i
have
been
to
russia
her
face
was
steadily
beautiful
composed
and
ready
ah
how
interesting
i
have
been
in
petersburg
i
love
russia
while
she
spoke
she
was
actually
looking
across
the
room
toward
the
tall
frenchman
her
late
companion
do
you
answered
paul
eagerly
his
face
lighted
up
after
the
manner
of
those
countenances
that
belong
to
men
of
one
idea
i
am
very
much
interested
in
russia
do
you
know
petersburg
she
asked
rather
hurriedly
i
mean
society
there
no
i
know
one
or
two
people
in
moscow
she
nodded
suppressing
a
quick
little
sigh
which
might
have
been
one
of
relief
had
her
face
been
less
pleasant
and
smiling
who
she
asked
indifferently
she
was
interested
in
the
lace
of
her
of
which
the
scent
faintly
reached
him
he
was
a
simple
person
and
the
faint
odor
gave
him
a
distinct
pleasure
a
suggested
intimacy
he
mentioned
several
muscovite
names
and
she
broke
into
a
sudden
laugh
how
terrible
they
sound
she
said
gayly
even
to
me
and
i
have
been
to
petersburg
but
you
speak
russian
mr
alexis
yes
he
answered
and
you
she
shook
her
head
and
gave
a
little
sigh
i
oh
no
i
am
not
at
all
clever
i
am
afraid

paul
had
been
five
months
in
england
when
he
met
sydney
bamborough
since
his
hurried
departure
from
tver
a
winter
had
come
and
gone
leaving
its
mark
as
winters
do
it
left
a
very
distinct
mark
on
russia
it
was
a
famine
winter
from
the
plains
that
lie
to
the
north
of
moscow
karl
steinmetz
had
written
piteous
descriptions
of
an
existence
which
seemed
hardly
worth
the
living
but
each
letter
had
terminated
with
a
prayer
remarkably
near
to
a
command
that
he
paul
howard
alexis
should
remain
in
england
so
paul
stayed
in
london
where
he
indulged
to
the
full
a
sadly
mistaken
hobby
this
man
had
as
we
have
seen
that
which
is
called
a
crank
or
a
loose
screw
according
to
the
fancy
of
the
speaker
he
had
conceived
the
absurd
idea
of
benefiting
his
and
of
turning
into
that
mistaken
channel
the
surplus
wealth
that
was
his
this
moreover
if
it
please
you
without
so
much
as
forming
himself
into
a
society
this
is
an
age
of
societies
and
far
from
concealing
from
the
left
hand
the
good
which
the
right
may
be
doing
we
publish
abroad
our
charities
on
all
hands
we
publish
in
a
stout
volume
our
names
and
donations
we
even
go
so
far
as
to
cultivate
an
artificial
charity
by
meat
and
drink
and
speeches
withal
when
we
have
eaten
and
drunk
the
plate
is
handed
round
and
from
the
fulness
of
our
heart
we
give
abundantly
we
are
cunning
even
in
our
we
do
not
pass
round
the
plate
until
the
decanters
have
led
the
way
and
thus
we
degrade
that
quality
of
the
human
heart
which
is
the
best
of
all
but
paul
howard
alexis
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
rich
out
of
england
and
that
roaring
lion
of
modern
days
organized
charity
passed
him
by
he
was
thus
left
to
evolve
from
his
own
mind
a
mistaken
sense
of
his
duty
toward
his
neighbor
that
there
were
thousands
of
persons
in
black
and
other
coats
ready
to
prove
to
him
that
revenues
gathered
from
russia
should
be
spent
in
the
east
end
or
the
east
indies
goes
without
saying
there
are
always
persons
among
us
ready
to
direct
the
charity
of
others
we
have
all
met
those
virtuous
persons
who
do
good
by
proxy
but
paul
had
not
he
had
never
come
face
to
face
with
the
charity
broker
the
man
who
stands
between
the
needy
and
the
giver
giving
nothing
himself
and
living
on
his
brokerage
sitting
in
a
comfortable
chair
with
his
feet
on
a
turkey
carpet
in
his
office
on
a
main
thoroughfare
paul
had
met
none
of
these
and
the
only
organized
charity
of
which
he
was
cognizant
was
the
great
russian
charity
league
betrayed
six
months
earlier
to
a
government
which
has
ever
turned
its
face
against
education
and
enlightenment
in
this
he
had
taken
no
active
part
but
he
had
given
largely
of
his
great
wealth
that
his
name
had
figured
on
the
list
of
families
sold
for
a
vast
sum
of
money
to
the
authorities
of
the
ministry
of
the
interior
seemed
all
too
sure
but
he
had
had
no
intimation
that
he
was
looked
upon
with
small
favor
the
more
active
members
of
the
league
had
been
less
fortunate
and
more
than
one
nobleman
had
been
banished
to
his
estates
although
the
sum
actually
paid
for
the
papers
of
the
charity
league
was
known
the
recipient
of
the
blood
money
had
never
been
discovered
it
was
a
large
sum
for
the
government
had
been
quick
to
recognize
the
necessity
of
nipping
this
movement
in
the
bud
education
is
a
dangerous
matter
to
deal
with
england
is
beginning
to
find
this
out
for
herself
for
on
the
heels
of
education
socialism
ever
treads
when
at
last
education
makes
a
foothold
in
russia
that
foothold
will
be
on
the
very
step
of
the
autocratic
throne
the
charity
league
had
as
steinmetz
put
it
the
primary
object
of
preparing
the
peasant
for
education
and
thereafter
placing
education
within
his
reach
such
proceedings
were
naturally
held
by
those
in
high
places
to
be
only
second
to
nihilism
all
this
and
more
which
shall
transpire
in
the
course
of
this
narration
was
known
to
paul
in
face
of
the
fact
that
his
name
was
prominently
before
the
russian
ministry
of
the
interior
he
proceeded
all
through
the
winter
to
ship
tools
agricultural
implements
seeds
and
food
the
prince
said
steinmetz
to
those
who
were
interested
in
the
matter
is
mad
he
thinks
that
a
russian
principality
is
to
be
worked
on
the
same
system
as
an
english
estate
he
would
laugh
and
shrug
his
shoulders
and
then
he
would
sit
down
and
send
a
list
of
further
requirements
to
paul
howard
alexis
esquire
in
london
paul
had
met
sydney
bamborough
on
one
or
two
occasions
and
had
been
interested
in
her
from
the
first
he
had
come
under
the
influence
of
her
beauty
but
she
was
then
a
married
woman
he
met
her
again
toward
the
end
of
the
terrible
winter
to
which
reference
has
been
made
and
found
that
a
mere
acquaintanceship
had
in
the
meantime
developed
into
friendship
he
could
not
have
told
when
and
where
the
great
social
barrier
had
been
surmounted
and
left
behind
he
only
knew
in
an
indefinite
way
that
some
such
change
had
taken
place
as
all
such
changes
do
not
in
intercourse
but
in
the
intervals
of
absence
it
is
a
singular
fact
that
we
do
not
make
our
friends
when
they
are
near
the
seed
of
friendship
and
love
alike
is
soon
sown
and
the
best
is
that
which
germinates
in
absence
that
friendship
had
rapidly
developed
into
something
else
paul
became
aware
early
in
the
season
and
as
we
have
seen
from
his
conversation
sydney
bamborough
innocent
and
guileless
as
she
was
might
with
all
modesty
have
divined
the
state
of
his
feelings
had
she
been
less
overshadowed
by
her
widow
weeds
she
apparently
had
no
such
suspicion
for
she
asked
paul
in
all
good
faith
to
call
the
next
day
and
tell
her
all
about
russia
dear
russia
my
cousin
maggie
she
added
is
staying
with
me
she
is
a
dear
girl
i
am
sure
you
will
like
her
paul
accepted
with
alacrity
but
reserved
to
himself
the
option
of
hating
sydney
bamborough
cousin
maggie
merely
because
that
young
lady
existed
and
happened
to
be
staying
in
upper
brook
street
at
five
the
next
afternoon
he
presented
himself
at
the
house
of
mourning
and
completely
filled
up
its
small
he
was
shown
into
the
where
he
discovered
miss
margaret
delafield
in
the
act
of
dragging
her
hat
off
in
front
of
the
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
he
heard
a
suppressed
exclamation
of
amused
horror
and
found
himself
shaking
hands
with
sydney
bamborough
the
lady
mentioned
paul
name
and
her
cousin
relationship
in
that
casual
manner
which
constitutes
an
introduction
in
these
degenerate
days
miss
delafield
bowed
laughed
and
moved
toward
the
door
she
left
the
room
and
behind
her
an
impression
of
breeziness
and
health
of
english
girlhood
and
a
certain
bright
cheerfulness
which
acts
as
a
filter
in
social
muddy
waters
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
come
i
was
moping
said
sydney
bamborough
she
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
resting
before
the
work
of
the
evening
this
lady
thoroughly
understood
the
art
of
being
beautiful
paul
did
not
answer
at
once
he
was
looking
at
a
large
photograph
which
stood
in
a
frame
on
the
mantelpiece
the
photograph
of
a
handsome
man
of
or
thirty
fair
and
shifty
looking
who
is
that
he
asked
abruptly
do
you
not
know
my
husband
paul
muttered
an
apology
but
he
did
not
turn
away
from
the
photograph
oh
never
mind
said
sydney
bamborough
in
reply
to
his
regret
that
he
had
stumbled
upon
a
painful
subject
i
never
she
paused
no
she
went
on
i
wo
say
that
but
so
far
as
conveying
what
she
meant
was
concerned
she
might
just
as
well
have
uttered
the
words
i
do
not
want
a
sympathy
which
is
unmerited
she
said
gravely
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
sitting
in
a
graceful
attitude
the
incarnation
of
a
most
refined
and
misfortune
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
for
a
moment
a
sort
of
photographic
instantaneous
shutter
exposing
for
the
hundredth
part
of
a
second
the
sensitive
plate
of
her
heart
then
she
suppressed
a
sigh
badly
i
was
married
horribly
young
she
said
before
i
knew
what
i
was
doing
but
even
if
i
had
known
i
do
not
suppose
i
should
have
had
the
strength
of
mind
to
resist
my
father
and
mother
they
forced
you
into
it
yes
said
bamborough
and
it
is
possible
that
a
respectable
and
harmless
pair
of
corpses
turned
in
their
respective
coffins
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
norwood
i
hope
there
is
a
special
hell
reserved
for
parents
who
ruin
their
daughters
lives
to
suit
their
own
ambition
said
paul
with
a
sudden
concentrated
heat
which
rather
startled
his
hearer
this
man
was
full
of
surprises
for
etta
sydney
bamborough
it
was
like
playing
with
fire
a
form
of
amusement
which
will
be
popular
as
long
as
feminine
curiosity
shall
last
you
are
rather
shocking
she
said
lightly
but
it
is
all
over
now
so
we
need
not
dig
up
old
grievances
only
i
want
you
to
understand
that
that
photograph
represents
a
part
of
my
life
which
was
only
painful
nothing
else
paul
standing
in
front
of
her
looked
down
thoughtfully
at
the
beautiful
upturned
face
his
hands
were
clasped
behind
him
his
firm
mouth
set
sternly
beneath
the
great
fair
mustache
in
russia
the
men
have
good
eyes
blue
fierce
intelligent
such
eyes
had
the
son
of
the
princess
alexis
there
was
something
in
etta
bamborough
that
stirred
up
within
him
a
quality
which
men
are
slowly
losing
namely
chivalry
steinmetz
held
that
this
man
was
quixotic
and
what
steinmetz
said
was
usually
worth
some
small
attention
whatever
faults
that
poor
knight
of
la
mancha
who
has
been
the
of
the
world
these
many
centuries
whatever
faults
or
foolishness
may
have
been
his
he
was
at
all
events
a
gentleman
paul
instinct
was
to
pity
this
woman
for
the
past
that
had
been
hers
his
desire
was
to
help
her
and
protect
her
to
watch
over
her
and
fight
her
battles
for
her
it
was
what
is
called
love
but
there
is
no
word
in
any
spoken
language
that
covers
so
wide
a
field
every
day
and
all
day
we
call
many
things
love
which
are
not
love
the
real
thing
is
as
rare
as
genius
but
we
usually
fail
to
recognize
its
rarity
we
misuse
the
word
for
we
fail
to
draw
the
necessary
distinctions
we
fail
to
recognize
the
plain
and
simple
truth
that
many
of
us
are
not
able
to
love
just
as
there
are
many
who
are
not
able
to
play
the
piano
or
to
sing
we
raise
up
our
voices
and
make
a
sound
but
it
is
not
singing
we
marry
and
we
give
in
marriage
but
it
is
not
loving
love
is
like
a
color
say
blue
there
are
a
thousand
shades
of
blue
and
the
outer
shades
are
at
last
not
blue
at
all
but
green
or
purple
so
in
love
there
are
a
thousand
shades
and
very
very
few
of
them
are
worthy
of
the
name
that
which
paul
howard
alexis
felt
at
this
time
for
etta
was
merely
the
chivalrous
instinct
that
teaches
men
their
primary
duty
toward
women
namely
to
protect
and
respect
them
but
out
of
this
instinct
grows
the
better
thing
love
there
are
some
women
whose
desire
it
is
to
be
all
things
to
all
men
instead
of
every
thing
to
one
this
was
the
in
the
way
of
etta
bamborough
it
was
her
instinct
to
please
all
at
any
price
and
her
obedience
to
such
instinct
was
often
unconscious
she
hardly
knew
perhaps
that
she
was
trading
upon
a
sense
of
chivalry
rare
in
these
days
but
had
she
known
she
could
not
have
traded
with
a
keener
comprehension
of
the
commerce
i
should
like
to
forget
the
past
altogether
she
said
but
it
is
hard
for
women
to
get
rid
of
the
past
it
is
rather
terrible
to
feel
that
one
will
be
associated
all
one
life
with
a
person
for
whom
no
one
had
any
respect
he
was
not
honorable
or
she
paused
for
the
intuition
of
some
women
is
marvellous
a
slight
change
of
countenance
had
told
her
that
charity
especially
toward
the
dead
is
a
commendable
quality
the
world
she
went
on
rather
hurriedly
never
makes
allowances
does
it
he
was
easily
led
i
suppose
and
people
said
things
of
him
that
were
not
true
did
you
ever
hear
of
him
in
russia
of
the
things
they
said
of
him
she
waited
for
the
answer
with
suppressed
eagerness
a
good
woman
defending
the
memory
of
her
dead
husband
a
fair
lioness
protecting
her
cub
no
i
never
hear
russian
gossip
i
know
no
one
in
petersburg
and
few
in
moscow
she
gave
a
little
sigh
of
relief
then
perhaps
poor
sydney
delinquencies
have
been
forgotten
she
said
in
six
months
every
thing
is
forgotten
now
he
has
only
been
dead
six
months
you
know
he
died
in
russia
all
the
while
she
was
watching
his
face
she
had
moved
in
a
circle
where
everything
is
known
where
men
have
faces
of
iron
and
nerves
of
steel
to
conceal
what
they
know
she
could
hardly
believe
that
paul
alexis
knew
so
little
as
he
pretended
so
i
heard
a
month
ago
he
said
in
a
flash
of
thought
etta
remembered
that
it
was
only
within
the
last
four
weeks
that
this
admirer
had
betrayed
his
admiration
could
this
be
that
phenomenon
of
the
novel
an
honorable
man
she
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
without
it
is
to
be
feared
much
respect
and
now
she
said
cheerfully
let
us
change
the
subject
i
have
inflicted
enough
of
myself
and
my
affairs
upon
you
for
one
day
tell
me
about
yourself
why
were
you
in
russia
last
summer
i
am
half
a
russian
he
answered
my
mother
was
russian
and
i
have
estates
there
her
surprise
was
a
triumph
of
art
oh
you
are
not
prince
pavlo
alexis
she
exclaimed
yes
i
am
she
rose
and
swept
him
a
deep
courtesy
to
the
full
advantage
of
her
beautiful
figure
my
respects
mon
prince
she
said
and
then
quick
as
lightning
for
she
had
seen
displeasure
on
his
face
she
broke
into
a
merry
laugh
no
i
wo
call
you
that
for
i
know
you
hate
it
i
have
heard
of
your
prejudices
and
if
it
is
of
the
slightest
interest
to
you
i
think
i
rather
admire
them
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
sydney
bamborough
memory
was
short
for
it
was
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
in
the
diplomatic
circles
in
which
she
moved
that
paul
howard
alexis
of
piccadilly
house
london
and
prince
pavlo
alexis
of
the
province
of
tver
were
one
and
the
same
man
having
however
fully
established
this
fact
from
the
evidence
of
her
own
ears
she
conversed
very
pleasantly
and
innocently
upon
matters
russian
and
english
until
other
visitors
arrived
and
paul
withdrew
chapter
v
the
baron
among
the
visitors
whom
paul
left
behind
him
in
the
little
in
brook
street
was
the
baron
claude
de
chauxville
baron
of
chauxville
and
chauxville
le
duc
in
the
province
of
france
attaché
to
the
french
embassy
to
the
court
of
james
before
men
a
rising
diplomatist
before
god
a
scoundrel
this
gentleman
remained
when
the
other
visitors
had
left
and
miss
maggie
delafield
seeing
his
intention
of
prolonging
a
visit
of
which
she
had
already
had
sufficient
made
an
inadequate
excuse
and
left
the
room
miss
delafield
being
a
young
english
person
of
that
simplicity
which
is
no
simplicity
at
all
but
merely
had
her
own
ideas
of
what
a
man
should
be
and
de
chauxville
had
the
misfortune
to
fall
short
of
those
ideas
he
was
too
epigrammatic
for
her
and
beneath
the
brilliancy
of
his
epigram
she
felt
at
times
the
presence
of
something
dark
and
nauseous
her
mental
attitude
toward
him
was
contemptuous
and
perfectly
polite
with
the
reputation
of
possessing
a
dangerous
fascination
one
of
those
reputations
which
can
only
emanate
from
the
man
himself
de
chauxville
neither
fascinated
nor
intimidated
miss
delafield
he
therefore
disliked
her
intensely
his
vanity
was
colossal
and
when
a
frenchman
is
vain
he
is
childishly
so
de
chauxville
watched
the
door
close
behind
miss
delafield
with
a
queer
smile
then
he
turned
suddenly
on
his
heels
and
faced
sydney
bamborough
your
cousin
he
said
is
a
typical
englishwoman
she
only
conceals
her
love
for
you
enquired
sydney
bamborough
the
baron
shrugged
his
shoulders
possibly
one
can
never
tell
she
conceals
it
very
well
if
it
exists
however
i
am
indifferent
the
virtue
of
the
violet
is
its
own
reward
perhaps
for
the
rose
always
wins
he
crossed
the
room
toward
sydney
bamborough
who
was
standing
near
the
mantelpiece
her
left
hand
was
hanging
idly
by
her
side
he
took
the
white
fingers
and
gallantly
raised
them
to
his
lips
but
before
they
had
reached
that
fount
of
truth
and
wisdom
she
jerked
her
hand
away
de
chauxville
laughed
the
quiet
assured
laugh
of
a
man
who
has
read
in
books
that
he
who
is
bold
enough
can
win
any
woman
and
believes
it
he
was
of
those
men
who
treat
and
speak
of
women
as
a
class
creatures
to
be
dealt
with
successfully
according
to
generality
and
maxim
it
is
a
singular
thing
by
the
way
that
men
as
a
whole
continue
to
disbelieve
in
a
woman
negative
singular
that
is
when
one
reflects
that
the
majority
of
men
have
had
at
least
one
negative
which
has
remained
a
negative
so
far
as
they
were
concerned
all
the
woman
life
i
am
aware
said
de
chauxville
that
the
rose
has
thorns
one
reason
why
the
violet
is
hors
de
concours
etta
smiled
almost
relenting
she
was
never
quite
safe
against
her
own
vanity
happy
the
woman
who
is
and
rare
i
suspect
that
the
violet
is
innocent
of
any
desire
to
enter
into
competition
said
etta
knowing
suggested
de
chauxville
that
although
the
race
is
not
always
to
the
swift
it
is
usually
so
please
do
not
stand
it
suggests
that
you
are
waiting
for
me
to
go
or
for
some
one
else
to
come
neither
then
prove
it
by
taking
this
chair
thus
near
the
fire
for
it
is
quite
an
english
spring
a
footstool
is
it
permitted
to
admire
your
slippers
what
there
is
of
them
now
you
look
comfortable
he
attended
to
her
wants
divined
them
and
perhaps
created
them
with
a
perfect
grace
and
much
too
intimate
a
knowledge
as
a
carpet
knight
he
was
faultless
and
etta
thought
of
paul
who
could
do
none
of
these
things
or
would
do
none
of
them
paul
who
never
made
her
feel
like
a
doll
will
you
not
sit
down
she
said
indicating
a
chair
which
he
did
not
take
he
selected
one
nearer
to
her
i
can
think
of
nothing
more
desirable
than
what
she
asked
her
vanity
was
like
a
hungry
fish
it
rose
to
everything
a
chair
in
this
room
a
modest
desire
she
said
is
that
really
all
you
want
in
this
world
no
he
answered
looking
at
her
she
gave
a
little
laugh
and
moved
rather
hurriedly
i
was
going
to
suggest
that
you
could
have
both
at
certain
fixed
periods
whenever
i
am
out
i
am
glad
you
did
not
suggest
it
why
she
asked
sharply
because
i
should
have
had
to
go
into
explanations
i
did
not
say
all
bamborough
was
looking
into
the
fire
only
half
listening
to
him
there
was
something
in
the
nature
of
a
duel
between
these
two
each
thought
more
of
the
next
stroke
than
of
the
present
party
do
you
ever
say
all
de
chauxville
she
asked
the
baron
laughed
perhaps
he
was
vain
of
the
reputation
that
was
his
for
this
man
was
held
to
be
a
finished
diplomatist
a
finished
diplomatist
be
it
known
is
one
who
is
a
dangerous
foe
and
an
unreliable
friend
perhaps
now
that
i
reflect
upon
it
continued
the
clever
woman
disliking
the
clever
man
silence
the
person
who
said
all
would
be
intolerable
there
are
some
things
which
go
without
it
said
de
chauxville
ah
looking
lazily
back
at
him
over
her
shoulder
yes
he
was
cautious
for
he
was
fighting
on
a
field
which
women
may
rightly
claim
for
their
own
he
really
loved
etta
he
was
trying
to
gauge
the
meaning
of
a
little
change
in
her
tone
toward
him
a
change
so
subtle
that
few
men
could
have
detected
it
but
claude
de
chauxville
accomplished
steersman
through
the
shoals
of
human
nature
especially
through
those
very
pronounced
shoals
who
call
themselves
women
of
the
world
claude
de
chauxville
knew
the
value
of
the
slightest
change
of
manner
should
that
change
manifest
itself
more
than
once
the
ring
of
indifference
or
something
dangerously
near
it
in
voice
had
first
been
noticeable
the
previous
evening
and
the
attaché
knew
it
it
had
been
in
her
voice
whenever
she
spoke
to
him
then
it
was
there
now
some
things
he
continued
in
a
voice
she
had
never
heard
before
for
this
man
was
innately
artificial
which
a
woman
usually
knows
before
they
are
told
to
her
what
sort
of
things
le
baron
he
gave
a
little
laugh
it
was
so
strange
a
thing
to
him
to
be
sincere
that
he
felt
awkward
and
abashed
he
was
surprised
at
his
own
sincerity
that
i
love
you
hum
you
have
known
it
long
the
face
which
he
could
not
see
was
not
quite
the
face
of
a
good
woman
etta
was
smiling
no
o
she
almost
whispered
i
think
you
must
have
known
it
he
corrected
suavely
will
you
do
me
the
honor
of
becoming
my
wife
it
was
very
correctly
done
claude
de
chauxville
had
regained
control
over
himself
he
was
able
to
think
about
the
riches
which
were
evidently
hers
but
through
the
thought
he
loved
the
woman
the
lady
lowered
the
feather
screen
which
she
was
holding
between
her
face
and
the
fire
regardless
of
the
imminent
danger
in
which
she
was
placing
her
complexion
she
studied
the
glowing
cinders
for
some
moments
weighing
something
or
some
persons
in
her
mind
no
my
friend
she
answered
in
french
at
length
the
baron
face
was
drawn
and
white
beneath
his
trim
black
mustache
there
was
a
momentary
gleam
of
sharp
white
teeth
as
he
bit
his
lip
he
came
nearer
to
her
leaning
one
hand
on
the
back
of
her
chair
looking
down
he
could
only
see
the
beautifully
dressed
hair
the
profile
she
continued
to
look
into
the
fire
conscious
of
the
hand
close
to
her
shoulder
no
my
friend
she
repeated
we
know
each
other
too
well
for
that
it
would
never
do
but
when
i
tell
you
that
i
love
you
he
said
quietly
with
his
voice
well
in
control
i
did
not
know
that
the
word
was
in
your
vocabulary
you
a
diplomat
and
a
man
you
put
the
word
there
etta
the
was
raised
for
a
moment
in
objection
presumably
to
the
christian
name
of
which
he
had
made
use
he
waited
passivity
was
one
of
his
strong
points
it
had
frightened
men
before
this
then
with
a
graceful
movement
she
swung
suddenly
round
in
her
chair
looking
up
at
him
she
broke
into
a
merry
laugh
i
believe
you
are
actually
in
earnest
she
cried
he
looked
quietly
down
into
her
face
without
moving
a
muscle
in
response
to
her
change
of
humor
very
clever
he
said
what
she
asked
still
smiling
the
attitude
the
voice
every
thing
you
have
known
all
along
that
i
am
in
earnest
you
have
known
it
for
the
last
six
months
you
have
seen
me
often
enough
when
i
was
well
not
in
earnest
to
know
the
difference
etta
rose
quickly
it
was
some
woman
instinct
that
made
her
do
so
standing
she
was
taller
than
de
chauxville
do
not
let
us
be
tragic
she
said
coldly
you
have
asked
me
to
marry
you
why
i
do
know
the
reason
will
probably
transpire
later
i
appreciate
the
honor
but
i
beg
to
decline
it
et
voilà
tout
all
is
said
he
spread
out
apologetic
hands
all
is
not
said
he
corrected
with
a
dangerous
suavity
i
acknowledge
the
claim
enjoyed
by
your
sex
to
the
last
word
in
this
matter
however
i
am
inclined
to
deny
it
to
the
individual
etta
sydney
bamborough
smiled
she
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
with
her
chin
resting
on
her
curved
fingers
the
attitude
was
eminently
calculated
to
show
to
full
advantage
a
faultless
figure
she
evidently
had
no
desire
to
cheapen
that
which
she
would
deny
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
waited
de
chauxville
was
vain
but
he
was
clever
enough
to
conceal
his
vanity
he
was
hurt
but
he
was
man
enough
to
hide
it
under
the
passivity
which
was
his
by
nature
and
practice
he
had
learned
to
think
very
quickly
but
now
he
was
at
a
disadvantage
he
was
unnerved
by
his
love
for
etta
by
the
sight
of
etta
before
him
daringly
audaciously
beautiful
by
the
thought
that
she
might
never
be
his
it
is
not
only
that
i
love
you
he
said
that
i
have
a
certain
position
to
offer
you
these
i
beg
you
to
take
at
their
poor
value
but
there
are
other
circumstances
known
to
both
of
us
which
are
more
worthy
of
your
attention
circumstances
which
may
dispose
you
to
reconsider
your
determination
nothing
will
do
that
she
replied
not
any
circumstance
etta
was
speaking
to
de
chauxville
and
thinking
of
paul
alexis
i
should
like
to
know
since
when
you
have
discovered
that
you
never
could
under
any
circumstances
marry
me
pursued
de
chauxville
not
that
it
matters
since
it
is
too
late
i
am
not
going
to
allow
you
to
draw
back
now
you
have
gone
too
far
all
this
winter
you
have
allowed
me
to
pay
you
conspicuous
and
marked
attentions
you
have
conveyed
to
me
and
to
the
world
at
large
the
impression
that
i
had
merely
to
speak
in
order
to
obtain
your
hand
i
doubt
said
etta
whether
the
world
at
large
is
so
deeply
interested
in
the
matter
as
you
appear
to
imagine
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
gone
too
far
but
i
reserve
to
myself
the
right
of
retracing
my
footsteps
wherever
and
whenever
i
please
i
am
sorry
i
conveyed
to
you
or
to
any
one
else
the
impression
that
you
had
only
to
speak
in
order
to
obtain
my
hand
and
i
can
only
conclude
that
your
overweening
vanity
has
led
you
into
a
mistake
which
i
will
be
generous
enough
to
hold
my
tongue
about
the
diplomatist
was
for
a
moment
taken
aback
mais
he
exclaimed
with
indignant
arms
outspread
and
even
in
his
own
language
he
could
find
nothing
to
add
to
the
expressive
monosyllable
i
think
you
had
better
go
said
etta
quietly
she
went
toward
the
and
rang
the
bell
de
chauxville
took
up
his
hat
and
gloves
of
course
he
said
coldly
his
voice
shaking
with
suppressed
rage
there
is
some
reason
for
this
there
is
i
presume
some
one
else
some
one
has
been
interfering
no
one
interferes
with
me
with
impunity
i
shall
make
it
my
business
to
find
out
who
is
this
he
did
not
finish
for
the
door
was
thrown
open
by
the
butler
who
announced
mr
alexis
paul
came
into
the
room
with
a
bow
toward
de
chauxville
who
was
going
out
and
whom
he
knew
slightly
i
came
back
he
said
to
ask
what
evening
next
week
you
are
free
i
have
a
box
for
the
paul
did
not
stay
the
thing
was
arranged
in
a
few
moments
and
as
he
left
the
he
heard
the
wheels
of
de
chauxville
carriage
etta
stood
for
a
moment
when
the
door
had
closed
behind
the
two
men
looking
at
the
portière
which
had
hidden
them
from
sight
as
if
following
them
in
thought
then
she
gave
a
little
laugh
a
queer
laugh
that
might
have
had
no
heart
in
it
or
too
much
for
the
ordinary
purposes
of
life
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
took
up
a
magazine
with
which
she
returned
to
the
chair
placed
for
her
before
the
fire
by
claude
de
chauxville
in
a
few
minutes
maggie
came
into
the
room
she
was
carrying
a
bundle
of
flannel
the
weakest
thing
i
ever
did
she
said
cheerfully
was
to
join
lady
crewel
working
guild
two
flannel
petticoats
for
the
young
by
thursday
morning
i
chose
the
young
because
the
petticoats
are
so
ludicrously
small
if
you
never
do
anything
weaker
than
that
said
etta
looking
into
the
fire
you
will
not
come
to
much
harm
perhaps
not
what
have
you
been
doing
something
weaker
yes
i
have
been
quarrelling
with
de
chauxville
maggie
held
up
a
petticoat
by
the
selvage
which
a
male
writer
takes
to
be
the
lower
hem
and
looked
at
her
cousin
through
the
orifice
intended
for
the
waist
of
the
young
if
one
could
manage
it
without
lowering
one
dignity
she
said
i
think
that
that
is
the
best
thing
one
could
possibly
do
with
de
chauxville
etta
had
taken
up
the
magazine
again
she
was
pretending
to
read
it
yes
but
he
knows
too
much
about
she
said
chapter
vi
the
talleyrand
club
it
has
been
said
of
the
talleyrand
club
that
the
only
qualifications
required
for
admittance
to
its
membership
are
a
and
a
glib
tongue
to
explain
the
whereabouts
of
the
talleyrand
club
were
only
a
work
of
supererogation
many
hansom
cabmen
know
it
hansom
cabmen
know
more
than
they
are
credited
with
the
talleyrand
as
its
name
implies
is
a
diplomatic
club
but
ambassadors
and
ministers
enter
not
its
portals
they
send
their
juniors
some
of
these
latter
are
in
the
habit
of
stating
that
london
is
the
hub
of
europe
and
the
talleyrand
its
certain
is
it
that
such
men
as
claude
de
chauxville
as
karl
steinmetz
and
a
hundred
others
who
are
or
have
been
political
are
to
be
found
in
the
talleyrand
rooms
it
is
a
quiet
club
with
many
members
and
sparse
accommodation
its
rooms
are
never
crowded
because
half
of
its
members
are
afraid
of
meeting
the
other
half
it
has
swinging
glass
doors
to
its
every
apartment
the
lower
portion
of
the
glass
being
opaque
while
the
upper
moiety
affords
a
thus
if
you
are
sitting
in
one
of
the
deep
comfortable
chairs
to
be
found
in
all
these
small
rooms
you
will
be
aware
from
time
to
time
of
eyes
and
a
bald
head
above
the
ground
glass
if
you
are
nobody
eyes
and
bald
head
will
prove
to
be
the
property
of
a
gentleman
who
does
not
know
you
or
knows
you
and
pretends
that
he
does
not
if
you
are
somebody
your
solitude
will
depend
upon
your
reputation
there
are
quite
a
number
of
bald
heads
in
the
talleyrand
club
bald
heads
surmounting
youthful
innocent
faces
the
innocence
of
these
gentlemen
is
quite
remarkable
like
a
certain
celestial
they
are
childlike
and
bland
they
ask
guileless
questions
they
make
blameless
mistakes
in
respect
to
facts
and
require
correction
which
they
receive
meekly
they
know
absolutely
nothing
and
their
thirst
for
information
is
as
insatiable
as
it
is
unobtrusive
the
atmosphere
is
vivacious
with
the
light
sound
of
many
foreign
tongues
it
bristles
with
the
ephemeral
importance
of
cheap
titles
one
never
knows
whether
one
neighbor
is
an
ornament
to
the
almanac
de
gotha
or
a
disgrace
to
a
degenerate
colony
of
refugees
some

bluff
foreigners
with
upright
hair
and
melancholy
eyes
who
put
up
philosophically
with
a
cheaper
brand
of
cigar
than
their

among
the

may
be
classed
karl
steinmetz
the
bluffest
of
the
bluff
innocent
even
of
his
own
innocence
karl
steinmetz
in
due
course
reached
england
and
in
natural
sequence
the
room
b
on
the
left
as
you
go
in
of
the
talleyrand
he
was
there
one
evening
after
an
excellent
dinner
taken
with
humorous
resignation
smoking
the
largest
cigar
the
waiter
could
supply
when
claude
de
chauxville
happened
to
have
nothing
better
or
nothing
worse
to
do
de
chauxville
looked
through
the
glass
door
for
some
seconds
then
he
twisted
his
waxed
mustache
and
lounged
in
steinmetz
was
alone
in
the
room
and
de
chauxville
was
evidently
almost
obviously
unaware
of
his
presence
he
went
to
the
table
and
proceeded
to
search
in
vain
for
a
newspaper
that
interested
him
he
raised
his
eyes
casually
and
met
the
quiet
gaze
of
karl
steinmetz
ah
he
exclaimed
yes
said
steinmetz
you
in
london
steinmetz
nodded
gravely
yes
he
repeated
one
never
knows
where
one
has
you
claude
de
chauxville
went
on
seating
himself
in
a
deep
newspaper
in
hand
you
are
a
bird
of
passage
a
little
heavy
on
the
wing
now
said
steinmetz
he
laid
his
newspaper
down
on
his
stout
knees
and
looked
at
de
chauxville
over
his
gold
he
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
the
fact
that
he
was
wondering
what
this
man
wanted
with
him
the
baron
seemed
to
be
wondering
what
object
steinmetz
had
in
view
in
getting
stout
he
suspected
some
motive
in
the
obesity
ah
he
said
deprecatingly
that
is
nothing
time
leaves
its
mark
upon
all
of
us
it
was
not
yesterday
that
we
were
in
petersburg
together
no
answered
steinmetz
it
was
before
the
german
empire
many
years
ago
de
chauxville
counted
back
with
his
slim
fingers
on
the
table
delightfully
innocent
yes
he
said
the
years
seem
to
fly
in
coveys
do
you
ever
see
any
of
our
friends
of
that
time
you
who
are
in
russia
who
were
our
friends
of
that
time
parried
steinmetz
polishing
his
glasses
with
a
silk
handkerchief
my
memory
is
a
broken
reed
you
remember
for
a
moment
claude
de
chauxville
met
the
full
quiet
gray
eyes
yes
he
said
significantly
i
remember
well
for
instance
prince
dawoff
dead
i
never
see
him
thank
heaven
the
princess
i
never
see
she
keeps
a
gambling
house
in
paris
and
little
andrea
never
sees
me
married
to
a
wholesale
undertaker
who
has
buried
her
past

the
count

pursued

where
is

banished
for
his
connection
with
the
charity
league
catrina
catrina
is
living
in
the
province
of
tver
we
are
neighbors
she
and
her
mother
the
countess
de
chauxville
nodded
none
of
the
details
really
interested
him
his
indifference
was
obvious
ah
the
countess
lanovitch
he
said
reflectively
she
was
a
foolish
woman
and
is
de
chauxville
laughed
this
clumsy
german
amused
him
immensely
many
people
amuse
us
who
are
themselves
amused
in
their
sleeve
and
er
the
sydney
bamboroughs
said
the
frenchman
as
if
the
name
had
almost
left
his
memory
karl
steinmetz
lazily
stretched
out
his
arm
and
took
up
the
he
unfolded
the
sheet
slowly
and
having
found
what
he
sought
he
read
aloud
excellency
the
roumanian
ambassador
gave
a
select
at
craven
gardens
yesterday
among
the
guests
were
the
baron
de
chauxville
feneer
pasha
lord
and
lady
standover
sydney
bamborough
and
others
steinmetz
threw
the
paper
down
and
leant
back
in
his
chair
so
my
dear
friend
he
said
it
is
probable
that
you
know
more
about
the
sydney
bamboroughs
than
i
do
if
claude
de
chauxville
was
disconcerted
he
certainly
did
not
show
it
his
was
a
face
eminently
calculated
to
conceal
whatever
thought
or
feeling
might
be
passing
through
his
mind
of
an
even
white
complexion
verging
on
pastiness
he
was
handsome
in
a
certain
statuesque
way
his
features
were
always
composed
and
dignified
his
hair
thin
and
straight
was
never
out
of
order
but
ever
smooth
and
sleek
upon
his
high
narrow
brow
his
eyes
had
that
dulness
which
is
characteristic
of
many
frenchmen
and
may
perhaps
be
attributed
to
the
habitual
enjoyment
of
too
rich
a
cuisine
and
too
many
cigarettes
de
chauxville
waved
aside
the
small
contretemps
with
easy
nonchalance
not
necessarily
he
said
in
cold
even
tones
sydney
bamborough
does
not
habitually
take
into
her
confidence
all
who
happen
to
dine
at
the
same
table
as
herself
your
confidential
woman
is
usually
a
liar
steinmetz
was
filling
his
pipe
this
man
had
the
evil
habit
of
smoking
a
wooden
pipe
after
a
cigar
my
very
dear
de
chauxville
he
said
without
lookup
your
epigrams
are
lost
on
me
i
know
most
of
them
i
have
heard
them
before
if
you
have
anything
to
tell
me
about
sydney
bamborough
for
heaven
sake
tell
it
to
me
quite
plainly
i
like
plain
dishes
and
unvarnished
stories
i
am
a
german
you
know
that
is
to
say
a
person
with
a
dull
palate
and
a
thick
head
de
chauxville
laughed
again
in
an
unemotional
way
you
alter
little
he
said
your
plainness
of
speech
takes
me
back
to
petersburg
yes
i
admit
that
sydney
bamborough
rather
interested
me
but
i
assume
too
much
that
is
no
reason
why
she
should
interest
you
she
does
not
my
good
friend
but
you
do
i
am
all
attention
do
you
know
anything
of
her
asked
de
chauxville
perfunctorily
not
as
a
man
who
expects
an
answer
or
intends
to
believe
that
which
he
may
be
about
to
hear
nothing
you
are
likely
to
know
more
karl
steinmetz
shrugged
his
heavy
shoulders
and
shook
his
head
doubtfully
i
am
not
a
lady
man
he
added
gruffly
the
good
god
has
not
shaped
me
that
way
i
am
too
d
d
fat
has
sydney
bamborough
fallen
in
love
with
me
has
some
imprudent
person
shown
her
my
photograph
i
hope
not
heaven
forbid
he
puffed
steadily
at
his
pipe
and
glanced
quickly
at
de
chauxville
through
the
smoke
no
answered
the
frenchman
quite
gravely
frenchmen
by
the
way
do
not
admit
that
one
may
be
too
or
too
stout
for
love
but
she
is
au
mieux
with
the
prince
which
prince
pavlo
the
frenchman
snapped
out
the
word
watching
the
other
benevolent
countenance
steinmetz
continued
to
smoke
placidly
and
contentedly
my
master
he
said
at
length
i
suppose
that
some
day
he
will
marry
de
chauxville
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
touched
the
button
of
the
electric
bell
and
when
the
servant
appeared
ordered
coffee
he
selected
a
cigarette
from
a
silver
case
with
considerable
care
and
having
lighted
it
smoked
for
some
moments
in
silence
the
servant
brought
the
coffee
which
he
drank
thoughtfully
steinmetz
was
leaning
back
in
his
deep
chair
with
his
legs
crossed
he
was
gazing
into
the
fire
which
burnt
brightly
although
it
was
nearly
may
the
habits
of
the
talleyrand
club
are
almost
continental
the
rooms
are
always
too
warm
the
silence
was
that
of
two
men
knowing
each
other
well
and
why
not
sydney
bamborough
asked
steinmetz
suddenly
why
not
indeed
replied
de
chauxville
it
is
no
affair
of
mine
a
wise
man
reduces
his
affairs
to
a
minimum
and
his
interest
in
the
affairs
of
his
neighbor
to
less
but
i
thought
it
would
interest
you
thanks
the
tone
of
the
big
man
in
the
was
not
dry
karl
steinmetz
knew
better
than
to
indulge
in
that
pastime
dryness
is
apt
to
parch
the
fount
of
expansiveness
de
chauxville
attention
was
apparently
caught
by
an
illustration
in
a
weekly
paper
lying
open
on
the
table
near
to
him
your
shifty
man
likes
something
to
look
at
he
did
not
speak
for
some
moments
then
he
threw
the
paper
aside
who
was
sydney
bamborough
at
any
rate
he
asked
with
a
careless
assumption
of
a
slanginess
which
is
affected
by
society
in
its
decadent
periods
so
far
as
i
remember
answered
steinmetz
he
was
something
in
the
diplomatic
service
yes
but
what
my
dear
friend
you
had
better
ask
his
widow
when
next
you
sit
beside
her
at
dinner
how
do
you
know
that
i
sat
beside
her
at
dinner
i
did
not
know
it
replied
steinmetz
with
a
quiet
smile
which
left
de
chauxville
in
doubt
as
to
whether
he
was
very
stupid
or
exceedingly
clever
she
seems
to
be
very
well
off
said
the
frenchman
i
am
glad
as
she
is
going
to
marry
my
master
de
chauxville
laughed
almost
awkwardly
and
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
he
changed
countenance
under
steinmetz
quiet
eyes
one
can
never
know
whom
a
woman
intends
to
marry
said
he
carelessly
even
if
they
can
themselves
which
i
doubt
but
i
do
not
understand
how
it
is
that
she
is
so
much
better
off
or
appears
to
be
since
the
death
of
her
husband
ah
she
is
much
better
off
or
appears
to
be
since
the
death
of
her
husband
said
the
stout
man
in
his
slow
germanic
way
yes
de
chauxville
rose
stretched
himself
and
yawned
men
are
not
always
be
it
understood
on
their
best
behavior
at
their
club
he
said
shortly
my
very
dear
friend
after
the
frenchman
had
left
karl
steinmetz
remained
quite
motionless
and
expressionless
in
his
chair
until
such
time
as
he
concluded
that
de
chauxville
was
tired
of
watching
him
through
the
glass
door
then
he
slowly
sat
forward
in
his
chair
and
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
our
friend
he
muttered
is
afraid
that
paul
is
going
to
marry
this
woman
now
i
wonder
why
these
two
had
met
before
in
a
past
which
has
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
the
present
narrative
they
had
disliked
each
other
with
a
completeness
partly
bred
of
racial
hatred
partly
the
outcome
of
diverse
interests
but
of
late
years
they
had
drifted
apart
there
was
no
reason
why
the
friendship
such
as
it
was
should
not
have
lapsed
into
a
mere
bowing
acquaintance
for
these
men
were
foreigners
understanding
fully
the
value
of
the
bow
as
an
interchange
of
masculine
courtesy
englishmen
bow
badly
steinmetz
knew
that
the
frenchman
had
recognized
him
before
entering
the
room
it
was
to
be
presumed
that
he
had
deliberately
chosen
to
cross
the
threshold
knowing
that
a
recognition
was
inevitable
karl
steinmetz
went
farther
he
suspected
that
de
chauxville
had
come
to
the
talleyrand
club
having
heard
that
he
was
in
england
with
the
purpose
in
view
of
seeking
him
out
and
warning
him
against
sydney
bamborough
it
would
appear
murmured
the
stout
philosopher
that
we
are
about
to
work
together
for
the
first
time
but
if
there
is
one
thing
that
i
dislike
more
than
the
enmity
of
claude
de
chauxville
it
is
his
friendship
chapter
vii
old
hands
karl
steinmetz
lifted
his
pen
from
the
paper
before
him
and
scratched
his
forehead
with
his
forefinger
now
i
wonder
he
said
aloud
how
many
bushels
there
are
in
a
ton
ach
how
am
i
to
find
out
these
english
weights
and
measures
this
english
money
when
there
is
a
metrical
system
he
sat
and
hardly
looked
up
when
the
clock
struck
seven
it
was
a
quiet
room
this
in
which
he
sat
the
library
of
paul
london
house
the
noise
of
piccadilly
reached
his
ears
as
a
faint
roar
not
entirely
unpleasant
but
sociable
and
full
of
life
accustomed
as
he
was
to
the
great
silence
of
russia
where
sound
seems
lost
in
space
the
hum
of
a
crowded
humanity
was
a
pleasant
change
to
this
philosopher
who
loved
his
kind
while
fully
recognizing
its
little
weaknesses
while
he
sat
there
still
wondering
how
many
bushels
of
seed
made
a
ton
paul
alexis
came
into
the
room
the
younger
man
was
in
evening
dress
he
looked
at
the
clock
rather
eagerly
will
you
dine
here
he
asked
and
steinmetz
wheeled
around
in
his
chair
i
am
going
out
to
dinner
he
explained
further
ah
said
the
elder
man
i
am
going
to
sydney
bamborough
steinmetz
bowed
his
head
gravely
he
said
nothing
he
was
not
looking
at
paul
but
at
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
there
was
a
short
silence
then
paul
said
with
entire
simplicity
i
shall
probably
ask
her
to
marry
me
and
she
will
probably
say
yes
i
am
not
so
sure
about
that
said
paul
with
a
laugh
for
this
man
was
without
conceit
he
had
gradually
been
forced
to
admit
that
there
are
among
men
persons
whose
natural
inclination
is
toward
evil
persons
who
value
not
the
truth
nor
hold
by
honesty
but
he
was
guileless
enough
to
believe
that
women
are
not
so
he
actually
believed
that
women
are
truthful
and
open
and
honorable
he
believes
it
still
which
is
somewhat
startling
there
are
a
few
such
dullards
yet
i
do
not
see
why
she
should
he
went
on
gravely
he
was
standing
by
the
empty
a
manly
upright
figure
one
who
was
not
very
clever
not
brilliant
at
all
somewhat
slow
in
his
speech
but
sure
deadly
sure
in
the
honesty
of
his
purpose
karl
steinmetz
looked
at
him
and
smiled
openly
with
the
quaint
air
of
resignation
that
was
his
you
have
never
seen
her
eh
enquired
paul
steinmetz
paused
then
he
told
a
lie
a
good
one
well
told
deliberately
no
we
are
going
to
the
opera
box
if
you
come
in
i
shall
have
pleasure
in
introducing
you
the
sooner
you
know
each
other
the
better
i
am
sure
you
will
approve
i
think
you
ought
to
marry
money
why
steinmetz
laughed
oh
he
answered
because
does
who
can
there
is
catrina
lanovitch
an
estate
as
big
as
yours
adjoining
yours
a
great
russian
family
a
good
girl
who
is
willing
paul
laughed
a
good
wholesome
laugh
you
are
inclined
to
exaggerate
my
manifold
and
obvious
qualifications
he
said
catrina
is
a
very
nice
girl
but
i
do
not
think
she
would
marry
me
even
if
i
asked
her
which
you
do
not
intend
to
do
certainly
not
then
you
will
make
an
enemy
of
her
said
steinmetz
quietly
it
may
be
inconvenient
but
that
can
not
be
helped
a
woman
scorned
you
know
shakspere
or
the
bible
i
always
mix
them
up
no
paul
catrina
lanovitch
is
a
dangerous
enemy
she
has
been
making
love
to
you
these
last
four
years
and
you
would
have
seen
it
if
you
had
not
been
a
fool
i
am
afraid
my
good
paul
you
are
a
fool
god
bless
you
for
it
i
think
you
are
wrong
said
paul
rather
curtly
not
about
me
being
a
fool
but
about
catrina
lanovitch
if
you
are
right
however
it
only
makes
me
dislike
her
instead
of
being
perfectly
indifferent
to
her
his
honest
face
flushed
up
finely
and
he
turned
away
to
look
at
the
clock
again
i
hate
your
way
of
talking
about
women
steinmetz
he
said
you
a
cynical
old
beast
you
know
heaven
forbid
my
dear
prince
i
admire
all
women
they
are
so
clever
so
innocent
so
do
not
your
english
novels
prove
it
your
english
stage
your
newspapers
so
who
supports
the
novelist
the
the
actor
who
but
your
english
ladies
better
than
being
cooks
like
your
german
ladies
retorted
paul
stoutly
if
you
german
this
evening
better
than
being
cooks
i
doubt
it
i
very
much
doubt
it
my
friend
at
what
time
shall
i
present
myself
at
box
this
evening
about
nine
as
soon
as
you
like
paul
looked
at
the
clock
the
pointers
lagged
horribly
he
knew
that
the
carriage
was
certain
to
be
at
the
door
waiting
in
the
quiet
street
with
its
great
restless
horses
its
two
perfectly
trained
men
its
gleaming
lamps
and
shining
harness
but
he
would
not
allow
himself
the
luxury
of
being
the
first
arrival
paul
had
himself
well
in
hand
at
last
it
was
time
to
go
see
you
later
he
said
thank
you
yes
replied
steinmetz
without
looking
up
so
paul
howard
alexis
sallied
forth
to
seek
the
hand
of
the
lady
of
his
choice
and
as
he
left
his
own
door
that
lady
was
receiving
claude
de
chauxville
in
her
the
two
had
not
met
for
some
weeks
not
indeed
since
etta
had
told
the
frenchman
that
she
could
not
marry
him
her
invitation
to
dine
couched
in
the
usual
friendly
words
had
been
the
first
move
in
that
game
commonly
called
bluff
claude
de
chauxville
acceptance
of
the
same
had
been
the
second
move
and
these
two
persons
who
were
not
afraid
of
each
other
shook
hands
with
a
pleasant
smile
of
greeting
while
paul
hurried
toward
them
through
the
busy
streets
am
i
forgiven
that
i
am
invited
to
dinner
asked
de
chauxville
imperturbably
when
the
servant
had
left
them
alone
etta
was
one
of
those
women
who
are
conscious
of
their
dress
some
may
protest
that
a
lady
moving
in
such
circles
would
not
be
so
but
in
all
circles
women
are
only
women
and
in
every
class
of
life
we
meet
such
as
etta
bamborough
women
who
while
they
talk
glance
down
and
rearrange
a
flower
or
a
piece
of
lace
it
is
a
mere
habit
seemingly
small
and
unimportant
but
it
marks
the
woman
and
sets
her
apart
etta
was
standing
on
the
hearthrug
beautifully
dressed
too
beautifully
dressed
it
is
possible
to
sit
down
her
maid
had
a
moment
earlier
confessed
that
she
could
do
no
more
and
etta
had
come
down
stairs
a
vision
of
luxury
of
womanly
loveliness
nevertheless
there
appeared
to
be
something
amiss
she
was
so
occupied
with
a
flower
at
her
shoulder
that
she
did
not
answer
at
once
forgiven
for
what
she
asked
at
length
in
that
preoccupied
tone
of
voice
which
tells
wise
men
that
only
questions
of
dress
will
be
considered
de
chauxville
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
his
graceful
gallic
way
mon
dieu
he
exclaimed
for
a
crime
which
requires
no
excuse
and
no
explanation
other
than
a
mirror
she
looked
up
at
him
innocently
a
mirror
yours
have
you
forgiven
me
for
falling
in
love
with
you
it
is
i
am
told
a
crime
that
women
sometimes
condone
it
was
no
crime
she
said
she
had
heard
the
wheels
of
carriage
it
was
a
misfortune
please
let
us
forget
that
it
ever
happened
de
chauxville
twirled
his
neat
mustache
looking
keenly
at
her
the
while
you
forget
he
said
but
i
will
remember
she
did
not
answer
but
turned
with
a
smile
to
greet
paul
i
think
you
know
each
other
she
said
gracefully
when
she
had
shaken
hands
and
the
two
men
bowed
they
were
foreigners
be
it
understood
there
were
three
languages
in
which
they
could
understand
each
other
with
equal
ease
where
maggie
exclaimed
bamborough
she
is
always
late
when
i
am
here
reflected
de
chauxville
but
he
did
not
say
it
miss
delafield
kept
them
waiting
a
few
minutes
and
during
that
time
etta
sydney
bamborough
gave
a
very
fine
display
of
prowess
with
the
bow
when
a
man
attempts
to
handle
this
delicate
weapon
he
usually
makes
if
one
may
put
it
thus
crudely
an
ass
of
himself
he
generally
succeeds
in
snapping
one
and
probably
both
of
the
strings
injuring
himself
most
certainly
in
the
process
not
so
however
this
clever
lady
she
had
a
smile
and
an
epigram
for
claude
de
chauxville
a
grave
air
of
sympathetic
interest
in
more
serious
affairs
for
paul
alexis
she
was
bright
and
amusing
guileless
and
very
worldly
wise
in
the
same
breath
simple
for
paul
and
a
match
for
de
chauxville
within
the
space
of
three
seconds
withal
she
was
a
beautiful
woman
beautifully
dressed
a
thousand
times
too
wise
to
scorn
her
womanhood
as
learned
fools
are
prone
to
do
in
print
and
on
platform
in
these
wordy
days
but
wielding
the
strongest
power
on
earth
to
wit
that
same
womanhood
with
daring
and
with
skill
a
learned
woman
is
not
of
much
account
in
the
world
a
clever
woman
moves
as
much
of
it
as
lies
in
her
neighborhood
that
is
to
say
as
much
as
she
cares
to
rule
for
women
love
power
but
they
do
not
care
to
wield
it
at
a
distance
paul
was
asked
to
take
sydney
bamborough
down
to
dinner
by
the
lady
herself
mon
ami
she
said
in
a
quiet
aside
to
de
chauxville
before
making
her
request
it
is
the
first
time
the
prince
dines
here
she
spoke
in
french
maggie
and
paul
were
talking
together
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
de
chauxville
bowed
in
silence
at
dinner
the
conversation
was
necessarily
general
and
as
such
is
not
worth
reporting
no
general
conversation
one
finds
is
of
much
value
when
set
down
in
black
and
white
it
is
not
even
grammatical
nowadays
to
be
more
correct
let
us
note
that
the
talk
lay
between
etta
and
de
chauxville
who
had
a
famous
supply
of
epigrams
and
bright
nothings
delivered
in
such
a
way
that
they
really
sounded
like
wisdom
etta
was
equal
to
him
sometimes
capping
his
sharp
wit
sometimes
contenting
herself
with
silvery
laughter
maggie
delafield
was
rather
distraite
as
de
chauxville
noted
the
girl
dislike
for
him
was
an
iron
that
entered
the
quick
of
his
vanity
anew
every
time
he
saw
her
there
was
no
petulance
in
the
aversion
such
as
he
had
perceived
with
other
maidens
who
were
only
resenting
a
passing
negligence
or
seeking
to
pique
his
curiosity
this
was
a
steady
and
if
you
will
unmaidenly
aversion
which
maggie
conscientiously
attempted
to
conceal
paul
it
is
to
be
feared
was
what
hostesses
call
heavy
in
hand
he
laughed
where
he
saw
something
to
laugh
at
but
not
elsewhere
which
in
some
circles
is
considered
morose
and
in
bad
form
he
joined
readily
enough
in
the
conversation
but
originated
nothing
those
topics
which
occupied
his
mind
did
not
present
themselves
as
suitable
to
this
occasion
his
devotion
to
etta
was
quite
obvious
and
he
was
simple
enough
not
to
care
that
it
should
be
so
maggie
was
by
turns
quite
silent
and
very
talkative
when
paul
and
etta
were
speaking
together
she
never
looked
at
them
but
fixedly
at
her
own
plate
at
a
decanter
or
a
when
she
spoke
she
addressed
her
remarks
valueless
enough
in
themselves
exclusively
to
the
man
she
disliked
claude
de
chauxville
there
was
something
amiss
in
the
pretty
little
room
there
were
shadows
seated
around
that
pretty
little
table
à
quatre
beside
the
guests
in
their
pretty
dresses
and
their
black
coats
silent
cold
shadows
who
ate
nothing
while
they
chilled
the
dainty
food
and
took
the
sweetness
from
the
succulent
dishes
these
shadows
had
crept
in
unawares
a
silent
partie
carrée
to
take
their
phantom
places
at
the
table
and
only
etta
seemed
able
to
jostle
hers
aside
and
talk
it
down
she
took
the
whole
burden
of
the
conversation
upon
her
pretty
shoulders
and
bore
it
through
the
little
banquet
with
unerring
skill
and
unflinching
good
humor
in
the
midst
of
her
merriest
laughter
the
clever
gray
eyes
would
flit
from
one
man
face
to
the
other
paul
had
been
brought
here
to
ask
her
to
marry
him
claude
de
chauxville
had
been
invited
that
he
might
be
tacitly
presented
to
his
successful
rival
maggie
was
there
because
she
was
a
woman
and
made
the
necessary
fourth
puppets
all
and
two
of
them
knew
it
and
some
of
us
know
it
all
our
lives
we
are
living
moving
puppets
we
let
ourselves
be
dragged
here
and
pushed
there
the
victim
of
one
who
happens
to
have
more
energy
of
mind
a
greater
steadfastness
of
purpose
a
keener
grasp
of
the
situation
called
life
we
smirk
and
smile
and
lose
the
game
because
we
have
begun
by
being
anvils
and
are
afraid
of
trying
to
be
hammers
but
etta
sydney
bamborough
had
to
deal
with
metal
of
a
harder
grain
than
the
majority
of
us
claude
de
chauxville
was
for
the
moment
forced
to
assume
the
humble
rôle
of
anvil
because
he
had
no
choice
maggie
delafield
was
passive
for
the
time
being
because
that
which
would
make
her
active
was
no
more
than
a
tiny
seedling
in
her
heart
the
girl
bid
fair
to
be
one
of
those
women
who
develop
late
who
ripen
slowly
like
the
best
fruit
during
the
drive
to
the
opera
house
the
two
women
in
etta
snug
little
brougham
were
silent
etta
had
her
thoughts
to
occupy
her
she
was
at
the
crucial
point
of
a
difficult
game
she
could
not
afford
to
allow
even
a
friend
to
see
so
much
as
the
corners
of
the
cards
she
held
in
the
luxurious
box
it
was
easily
enough
arranged
etta
and
paul
together
in
front
de
chauxville
and
maggie
at
the
other
corner
of
the
box
i
have
asked
my
friend
karl
steinmetz
to
come
in
during
the
evening
said
paul
to
etta
when
they
were
seated
he
is
anxious
to
make
your
acquaintance
he
is
my
prime
minister
over
in
russia
etta
smiled
graciously
it
is
kind
of
him
she
answered
to
be
anxious
to
make
my
acquaintance
she
was
apparently
listening
to
the
music
in
reality
she
was
hurrying
back
mentally
over
half
a
dozen
years
she
had
never
had
much
to
do
with
the
stout
german
philosopher
but
she
knew
enough
of
him
to
scorn
the
faint
hope
that
he
might
have
forgotten
her
name
and
her
individuality
etta
bamborough
had
never
been
disconcerted
in
her
life
yet
this
incident
came
very
near
to
bringing
about
the
catastrophe
at
what
time
she
asked
is
he
coming
in
about
nine
etta
had
a
watch
on
a
bracelet
on
her
arm
such
women
always
know
the
time
it
was
a
race
and
etta
won
it
she
had
only
half
an
hour
de
chauxville
was
there
and
maggie
with
her
quiet
honest
eyes
but
the
widow
of
sydney
bamborough
made
paul
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
and
she
promised
to
give
him
his
answer
later
she
did
it
despite
a
thousand
difficulties
and
more
than
one
danger
accomplished
it
with
as
the
sporting
people
say
plenty
to
spare
before
the
door
behind
them
was
opened
by
the
attendant
and
karl
steinmetz
burly
humorously
imperturbable
and
impenetrable
stood
smiling
gravely
on
the
situation
he
saw
claude
de
chauxville
and
before
the
frenchman
had
turned
round
the
expression
on
steinmetz
large
and
placid
countenance
had
changed
from
the
usually
preceding
an
introduction
to
one
of
a
dim
recognition
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
madame
somewhere
before
i
think
in
petersburg
was
it
not
etta
composed
and
smiling
said
that
it
was
so
and
introduced
him
to
maggie
de
chauxville
took
the
opportunity
of
leaving
that
young
side
and
placing
himself
near
enough
to
paul
and
etta
to
completely
frustrate
any
further
attempts
at
confidential
conversation
for
a
moment
steinmetz
and
paul
were
left
standing
together
i
have
had
a
telegram
said
steinmetz
in
russian
we
must
go
back
to
tver
there
is
cholera
again
when
can
you
come
beneath
his
heavy
mustache
paul
bit
his
lip
in
three
days
he
answered
true
you
will
come
with
me
enquired
steinmetz
under
cover
of
the
clashing
music
of
course
steinmetz
looked
at
him
curiously
he
glanced
toward
etta
but
he
said
nothing
chapter
viii
safe
the
season
wore
on
to
its
perihelion
a
period
the
scientific
books
advise
us
of
the
highest
clang
and
crash
of
speed
and
whirl
of
the
greatest
brilliancy
and
deepest
glow
of
a
planet

the

of

the
pursuit
of
pleasure
and
the
scientific
demolition
of
our
common
enemy
time
received
all
the
care
which
such
matters
require
débutantes
bloomed
and
were
duly
culled
by
aged
connoisseurs
of
such
wares
or
by
youthful
aspirants
with
the
means
to
pay
the
piper
in
the
form
of
a
handsome
settlement
the
usual
number
of
young
persons
of
the
gentler
sex
entered
the
lists
of
life
with
the
mistaken
notion
that
it
is
love
that
makes
the
world
go
round
to
ride
away
from
the
joust
wiser
and
sadder
women
there
was
the
same
round
of
conventional
pleasures
which
the
reader
and
his
humble
servant
have
mixed
in
deeply
or
dilettante
according
to
his
taste
or
capacity
for
such
giddy
work
there
was
withal
the
usual
heart
anything
you
will
but
breaking
for
we
have
not
breaking
hearts
among
us
providence
it
would
seem

run
short
of
the
commodity
and
deals
out
only
a
few
among
a
number
of
persons
amid
the
whirl
of
rout
and
ball
and
picnic
and
paul
howard
alexis
stalked
misunderstood
distrusted
an
object
of
ridicule
to
some
of
pity
to
others
of
impatience
to
all
a
man
if
it
please
you
with
a
purpose
a
purpose
at
the
latter
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
when
most
of
us
having
decided
that
there
is
no
future
take
it
upon
ourselves
to
despise
the
present
paul
soon
discovered
that
he
was
found
out
at
no
time
a
pleasant
condition
of
things
except
indeed
when
callers
are
about
that
which
eton
and
cambridge
had
failed
to
lay
their
fingers
upon
every
mother
had
found
out
for
herself
in
a
week
that
the
discovery
had
been
carefully
kept
in
each
maternal
breast
it
is
needless
to
relate
ces
dames
are
not
confidential
upon
such
matters
between
themselves
when
they
have
scented
their
game
they
stalk
him
and
if
possible
bag
him
in
a
feline
solitude
which
has
no
fears
for
stout
ambitious
hearts
the
fear
is
that
some
other
prowling
mother
of
an
eligible
maiden
may
hit
upon
the
same
scent
paul
was
invited
to
quiet
dinners
and
a
little
music
to
quiet
dinners
without
the
music
to
a
very
little
music
and
no
dinner
whatever
the
number
of
ladies
who
had
a
seat
in
a
box
thrown
upon
their
hands
at
the
last
minute
a
seat
next
to
angelina
in
her
new
pink
or
blanche
in
her
sweet
poult
de
soie
the
number
of
these
ladies
one
can
only
say
was
singular
because
politeness
forbids
one
to
suggest
that
it
was
suspicious
soft
cheeks
became
rosy
at
his
approach
partly
perhaps
because
soft
and
dainty
toes
in
satin
slippers
were
trodden
upon
with
maternal
emphasis
at
that
moment
soft
eyes
looked
love
into
eyes
that
alas
only
returned
preoccupation
there
was
always
room
on
an
engagement
card
for
paul
name
there
was
always
space
in
the
smallest
for
paul
person
vast
though
the
latter
was
there
was
fond
mothers
conveyed
it
to
him
subtly
after
supper
and
champagne
an
aching
void
in
more
than
one
maiden
heart
which
was
his
exact
fit
but
paul
was
at
once
too
simple
and
too
clever
for
matron
and
maid
alike
too
simple
because
he
failed
to
understand
the
inner
meaning
of
many
pleasant
things
that
the
guileless
fair
one
said
to
him
too
clever
because
he
met
the
subtle
matron
with
the
only
arm
she
feared
a
perfect
honesty
and
when
at
last
he
obtained
his
answer
from
the
coy
and
hesitating
etta
there
was
no
gossip
in
london
who
could
put
forward
a
just
cause
or
impediment
etta
gave
him
the
answer
one
evening
at
the
house
of
a
mutual
friend
where
a
multitude
of
guests
had
assembled
ostensibly
to
hear
certain
celebrated
singers
apparently
to
whisper
recriminations
on
their
entertainer
champagne
it
was
a
dull
business
except
indeed
for
paul
howard
alexis
as
for
the
lady
the
only
lady
his
honest
simple
world
contained
who
shall
say
inwardly
she
may
have
been
in
trembling
coy
alarm
in
breathless
blushing
hesitation
outwardly
she
was
however
exceedingly
composed
and
she
had
been
as
careful
as
ever
of
her
toilet
as
hard
to
please
as
dare
we
say
snappish
with
her
maids
the
beautiful
hair
had
no
one
of
its
aureate
threads
out
of
place
the
pink
of
her
cheek
was
steady
unruffled
fair
to
behold
her
whole
demeanor
was
admirable
in
its
repose
did
she
love
him
was
it
in
her
power
to
love
any
man
not
the
humble
chronicler
not
any
man
perhaps
and
but
few
women
can
essay
an
answer
suffice
it
that
she
accepted
him
in
exchange
for
the
title
he
could
give
her
the
position
he
could
assure
to
her
the
wealth
he
was
ready
to
lavish
upon
her
and
lastly
let
us
mention
in
the
effete
way
the
love
he
bore
her
in
exchange
for
these
she
gave
him
her
hand
thus
etta
sydney
bamborough
was
enabled
to
throw
down
her
cards
at
last
and
win
the
game
she
had
played
so
skilfully
the
widow
of
an
obscure
little
foreign
office
clerk
she
might
have
been
a
baroness
but
she
put
the
smaller
honor
aside
and
aspired
to
a
prince
behind
the
gay
smile
there
must
have
been
a
quick
and
resourceful
brain
daring
to
scheme
intrepid
in
execution
within
the
fair
breast
there
must
have
been
a
heart
resolute
indomitable
devoid
of
weak
scruple
mark
the
last
it
is
the
scruple
that
keeps
the
reader
and
his
humble
servant
from
being
greater
men
than
they
are
yes
says
etta
allowing
paul
to
take
her
perfectly
gloved
hand
in
his
great
steady
grasp
yes
i
have
my
answer
ready
they
were
alone
in
the
plashy
solitude
of
an
inner
conservatory
between
the
songs
of
the
great
singers
she
was
half
afraid
of
this
strong
man
for
he
had
strange
ways
with
him
not
uncouth
but
unusual
and
somewhat
surprising
in
a
finnicking
emotionless
generation
and
what
is
it
whispers
paul
eagerly
ah
what
fools
men
are
what
fools
they
always
will
be
etta
gave
a
little
nod
looking
shamefacedly
down
at
the
pattern
of
her
lace
fan
is
that
it
he
asked
breathlessly
the
nod
was
repeated
and
paul
howard
alexis
was
thereby
made
the
happiest
man
in
england
she
half
expected
him
to
take
her
in
his
arms
despite
the
temporary
nature
of
their
solitude
perhaps
she
half
wished
it
for
behind
her
and
exceedingly
practical
appreciation
of
his
wealth
there
lurked
a
very
feminine
curiosity
and
interest
in
his
feelings
a
curiosity
somewhat
whetted
by
the
manifold
differences
that
existed
between
him
and
the
society
lovers
with
whom
she
had
hitherto
played
the
pretty
game
but
paul
contented
himself
with
raising
the
gloved
fingers
to
his
lips
restrained
by
a
feeling
of
respect
for
her
which
she
would
not
have
understood
and
probably
did
not
merit
but
she
said
with
a
sudden
smile
i
take
no
responsibility
i
am
not
very
sure
that
it
will
be
a
success
i
can
only
try
to
make
you
happy
goodness
knows
if
i
shall
succeed
you
have
only
to
be
yourself
to
do
that
he
answered
with
promptness
and
a
blindness
which
is
the
special
privilege
of
those
happy
fools
she
gave
a
strange
little
smile
but
how
do
i
know
that
our
lives
will
harmonize
in
the
least
i
know
nothing
of
your
daily
existence
where
you
live
where
you
want
to
live
i
should
like
to
live
mostly
in
russia
he
answered
honestly
her
expression
did
not
change
it
merely
fixed
itself
as
one
sees
the
face
of
a
watching
cat
fix
itself
when
the
longed
for
mouse
shows
a
whisker
ah
she
said
lightly
confident
in
her
own
power
that
will
arrange
itself
later
i
am
glad
i
am
rich
said
paul
simply
because
i
shall
be
able
to
give
you
all
you
want
there
are
many
little
things
that
add
to
a
woman
comfort
i
shall
find
them
out
and
see
that
you
have
them
are
you
so
very
rich
paul
she
asked
with
an
innocent
wonder
but
i
do
think
it
matters
do
you
i
do
not
think
that
riches
have
much
to
do
with
happiness
no
he
answered
he
was
not
a
person
with
many
theories
upon
life
or
happiness
or
such
matters
which
by
the
way
are
in
no
way
affected
by
theories
by
taking
thought
we
can
not
add
a
cubit
to
the
height
of
our
happiness
we
can
only
undermine
its
base
by
too
searching
an
analysis
of
that
upon
which
it
is
built
so
paul
replied
no
and
took
pleasure
in
looking
at
her
as
any
lover
must
needs
have
done
except
of
course
she
said
that
one
may
do
good
with
great
riches
she
gave
a
little
sigh
as
if
deploring
the
misfortune
that
hitherto
her
own
small
means
had
fallen
short
of
the
happy
point
at
which
one
may
begin
doing
good
are
you
so
very
rich
paul
she
repeated
as
if
she
was
rather
afraid
of
those
riches
and
mistrusted
them
oh
i
suppose
so
horribly
rich
she
had
withdrawn
her
hand
she
gave
it
to
him
again
with
a
pretty
movement
usually
understood
to
indicate
bashfulness
it
ca
be
helped
she
said
we
she
dwelt
upon
the
word
ever
so
slightly
we
can
perhaps
do
a
little
good
with
it
then
suddenly
he
blurted
out
all
his
wishes
on
this
point
his
quixotic
aims
the
foolish
imaginings
of
a
too
chivalrous
soul
she
listened
prettily
eager
sweetly
compassionate
of
the
sorrows
of
the
peasantry
whom
he
made
the
object
of
his
simple
pity
her
gray
eyes
contracted
with
horror
when
he
told
her
of
the
misery
with
which
he
was
too
familiar
her
pretty
lips
quivered
when
he
told
her
of
little
children
born
only
to
starve
because
their
mothers
were
starving
she
laid
her
gloved
fingers
gently
on
his
when
he
recounted
tales
of
strong
men
good
fathers
in
their
simple
barbarous
way
who
were
well
content
that
the
children
should
die
rather
than
be
saved
to
pass
a
miserable
existence
without
joy
without
hope
she
lifted
her
eyes
with
admiration
to
his
face
when
he
told
her
what
he
hoped
to
do
what
he
dreamed
of
accomplishing
she
even
made
a
few
eager
heartfelt
suggestions
fitly
coming
from
a
woman
touched
with
a
woman
tenderness
lightened
by
a
woman
sympathy
and
knowledge
it
was
in
its
way
a
tragedy
the
picture
we
are
called
to
look
upon
these
newly
made
lovers
not
talking
of
themselves
as
is
the
habit
of
such
surrounded
by
every
luxury
both
refined
and
wealthy
both
educated
both
intelligent
he
earnest
quite
absorbed
in
his
happiness
because
that
happiness
seemed
to
fall
in
so
easily
with
the
busier
and
as
some
might
say
the
nobler
side
of
his
ambition
she
failing
to
understand
his
aspirations
thinking
only
of
his
wealth
but
she
said
at
length
shall
you
we
be
allowed
to
do
all
this
i
thought
that
such
schemes
were
not
encouraged
in
russia
it
is
such
a
pity
to
pauperize
the
people
you
can
not
pauperize
a
man
who
has
absolutely
nothing
replied
paul
of
course
we
shall
have
difficulties
but
together
i
think
we
shall
be
able
to
overcome
them
etta
smiled
sympathetically
and
the
smile
finished
up
as
it
were
with
a
gleam
very
like
amusement
she
had
been
vouchsafed
for
a
moment
a
vision
of
herself
in
some
squalid
russian
village
in
a
hideous
tweed
dress
dispensing
the
necessaries
of
life
to
a
people
only
little
raised
above
the
beasts
of
the
field
the
vision
made
her
smile
as
well
it
might
in
petersburg
life
might
be
tolerable
for
a
little
in
the
height
of
the
season
for
a
few
weeks
of
the
brilliant
northern
winter
but
in
no
other
part
of
russia
could
she
dream
of
dwelling
they
sat
and
talked
of
their
future
as
lovers
will
knowing
as
little
of
it
as
any
of
us
building
up
castles
in
the
air
such
edifices
as
we
have
all
constructed
destined
no
doubt
to
the
same
rapid
collapse
as
some
of
us
have
quailed
under
paul
with
lamentable
honesty
talked
almost
as
much
of
his
stupid
peasants
as
of
his
beautiful
companion
which
pleased
her
not
too
well
etta
with
a
strange
persistence
brought
the
conversation
ever
back
and
back
to
the
house
in
london
the
house
in
petersburg
the
great
grim
castle
in
the
government
of
tver
and
the
princely
and
once
on
the
subject
of
tver
paul
could
scarce
be
brought
to
leave
it
i
am
going
back
there
he
said
at
length
when
she
asked
with
a
composure
which
did
infinite
credit
to
her
modest
reserve
her
love
was
jealously
guarded
it
lay
too
deep
to
be
disturbed
by
the
thought
that
her
lover
would
leave
her
soon
was
his
answer
she
did
not
speak
at
once
should
she
try
the
extent
of
her
power
over
him
never
was
lover
so
chivalrous
so
respectful
so
sincere
should
she
gauge
the
height
of
her
supremacy
if
it
proved
less
powerful
than
she
suspected
she
would
at
all
events
be
credited
with
a
very
natural
aversion
to
parting
from
him
paul
she
said
you
can
not
do
that
not
so
soon
i
can
not
let
you
go
he
flushed
up
to
the
eyes
suddenly
like
a
girl
there
was
a
little
pause
and
the
color
slowly
left
his
face
somehow
that
pause
frightened
etta
i
am
afraid
i
must
go
he
said
gravely
at
length
must
a
prince
it
is
on
that
account
he
replied
then
i
am
to
conclude
that
you
are
more
devoted
to
your
peasants
than
to
me
he
assured
her
to
the
contrary
she
tried
once
again
but
nothing
could
move
him
from
his
decision
etta
was
perhaps
a
person
and
as
such
failed
to
attach
due
importance
to
this
proof
that
her
power
over
him
was
limited
it
ceased
in
fact
to
exist
as
soon
as
it
touched
that
strong
sense
of
duty
which
is
to
be
found
in
many
men
and
in
remarkably
few
women
it
almost
seemed
as
if
the
abrupt
departure
of
her
lover
was
in
some
sense
a
relief
to
etta
sydney
bamborough
for
while
he
was
grave
and
earnest
during
the
small
remainder
of
the
evening
she
continued
to
be
sprightly
and
gay
the
last
he
saw
of
her
was
her
smiling
face
at
the
window
as
her
carriage
drove
away
arrived
at
the
little
house
in
upper
brook
street
maggie
and
etta
went
into
the
where
biscuits
and
wine
were
set
out
their
maids
came
and
took
their
cloaks
away
leaving
them
alone
paul
and
i
are
engaged
said
etta
suddenly
she
was
picking
the
withered
flowers
from
her
dress
and
throwing
them
carelessly
on
the
table
maggie
was
standing
with
her
back
to
her
with
her
two
hands
on
the
she
was
about
to
turn
round
when
she
caught
sight
of
her
own
face
in
the
mirror
and
that
which
she
saw
there
made
her
change
her
intention
i
am
not
surprised
she
said
in
an
even
voice
standing
like
a
statue
i
congratulate
you
i
think
he
is
nice
you
also
think
he
is
too
good
for
me
said
etta
with
a
little
laugh
there
was
something
in
that
laugh
a
ring
of
wounded
vanity
the
wounded
vanity
of
a
bad
woman
who
is
in
the
presence
of
her
superior
no
answered
maggie
slowly
tracing
the
veins
of
the
marble
across
the
no
o
not
that
etta
looked
up
at
her
it
was
rather
singular
that
she
did
not
ask
what
maggie
did
think
perhaps
she
was
afraid
of
a
certain
british
honesty
which
characterized
the
girl
thought
and
speech
instead
she
rose
and
indulged
in
a
yawn
which
may
have
been
counterfeit
but
it
was
a
good
counterfeit
will
you
have
a
biscuit
she
said
no
thanks
then
shall
we
go
to
bed
yes
chapter
ix
the
prince
the
village
of
osterno
lying
or
rather
scrambling
along
the
banks
of
the
river
oster
is
at
no
time
an
exhilarating
spot
it
is
a
large
village
numbering
over
nine
hundred
souls
as
the
board
affixed
to
its
first
house
testifieth
in
incomprehensible
russian
figures
a
soul
be
it
known
is
a
different
object
in
the
land
of
the
czars
to
that
vague
protoplasm
about
which
our
young
persons
think
such
mighty
thoughts
our
old
men
write
such
famous
big
books
a
soul
is
namely
a
man
in
russia
the
women
have
not
yet
begun
to
seek
their
rights
and
lose
their
privileges
a
man
is
therefore
a
soul
in
russia
and
as
such
enjoys
the
doubtful
privilege
of
contributing
to
the
and
to
every
other
tax
in
compensation
for
the
impost
he
is
apportioned
his
share
of
the
common
land
of
the
village
and
by
the
cultivation
of
this
ekes
out
an
existence
which
would
be
valueless
if
he
were
a
teetotaller
it
is
melancholy
to
have
to
record
this
fact
in
the
pages
of
a
respectable
volume
like
the
present
but
facts
as
the
orator
who
deals
in
fiction
is
ever
ready
to
announce
facts
can
not
be
ignored
and
any
man
who
has
lived
in
russia
has
dabbled
in
russian
humanity
and
noted
the
singular
unattractiveness
of
russian
life
any
such
man
can
scarcely
deny
the
fact
that
if
one
deprives
the
moujik
of
his
privilege
of
getting
gloriously
and
frequently
intoxicated
one
takes
away
from
that
same
moujik
the
one
happiness
of
his
existence
that
the
russian
peasant
is
by
nature
one
of
the
cheeriest
the
noisiest
and
of
men
is
only
another
proof
of
the
creator
power
for
this
dimly
lighted
soul
has
nothing
to
cheer
him
on
his
forlorn
way
but
the
memory
of
the
last
indulgence
in
strong
drink
and
the
hope
of
more
to
come
he
is
harassed
by
a
ruthless
he
is
shut
off
from
the
world
by
enormous
distances
over
impracticable
roads
when
the
famine
comes
and
come
it
assuredly
will
the
moujik
has
no
alternative
but
to
stay
where
he
is
and
starve
since
alexander
ii
of
philanthropic
memory
made
the
russian
serf
a
free
man
the
blessings
of
freedom
have
been
found
to
resolve
themselves
chiefly
into
a
perfect
liberty
to
die
of
starvation
of
cold
or
of
dire
disease
when
he
was
a
serf
this
man
was
of
some
small
value
to
some
one
now
he
is
of
no
consequence
to
any
one
whatsoever
except
himself
and
with
considerable
intelligence
he
sets
but
small
store
upon
his
own
existence
freedom
in
fact
came
to
him
before
he
was
ready
for
it
and
hampered
as
he
has
been
by
petty
departmental
tyranny
governmental
neglect
and
a
natural
stupidity
he
has
made
very
small
progress
toward
a
mental
independence
all
that
he
has
learnt
to
do
is
to
hate
his
tyrants
when
famine
urges
him
he
goes
blindly
helplessly
dumbly
and
tries
to
take
by
force
that
which
is
denied
by
force
with
us
in
england
the
poor
man
raises
up
his
voice
and
cries
aloud
when
he
wants
something
he
always
wants
something
never
work
by
the
way
and
therefore
his
voice
pervades
the
atmosphere
he
has
his
evening
newspaper
which
is
dear
at
the
moderate
sum
of
a
halfpenny
he
has
his
professional
organizers
and
his
trafalgar
square
he
even
has
his
members
of
parliament
he
does
no
work
and
he
does
not
starve
in
his
generation
the
poor
man
thinks
himself
wise
in
russia
however
things
are
managed
differently
the
poor
man
is
under
the
heel
of
the
rich
some
day
there
will
be
in
russia
a
terror
but
not
yet
some
day
the
moujik
will
erect
unto
himself
a
rough
sort
of
a
guillotine
but
not
in
our
day
perhaps
some
of
us
who
are
young
men
now
may
dimly
read
in
our
dotage
of
a
great
upheaval
beside
which
the
terror
of
france
will
be
tame
and
uneventful
who
can
tell
when
a
country
begins
to
grow
its
mental
development
is
often
startlingly
rapid
but
we
have
to
do
with
russia
of
and
the
village
of
osterno
in
the
government
of
tver
not
a
famine
government
mind
you
for
these
are
the
volga
provinces
samara
pensa
voronish
vintka
and
a
dozen
others
no
tver
the
civilized
the
prosperous
the
manufacturing
centre
osterno
is
built
of
wood
should
it
once
fairly
catch
alight
in
a
high
wind
all
that
will
be
left
of
this
town
will
be
a
few
charred
timbers
and
some
dazed
human
beings
the
inhabitants
know
their
own
danger
and
endeavor
to
meet
it
in
their
fatalistic
manner
each
village
has
its
fire
organization
each
soul
has
his
appointed
place
his
appointed
duty
and
his
special
contribution
be
it
bucket
or
rope
or
ladder
to
bring
to
the
conflagration
but
no
one
ever
dreams
of
being
sober
and
vigilant
at
the
right
time
so
the
organization
like
many
larger
such
is
a
broken
reed
the
street
bounded
on
either
side
by
low
wooden
houses
is
singularly
enough
well
paved
this
the
traveller
is
told
by
the
tyrant
prince
pavlo
who
made
the
road
because
he
did
not
like
driving
over
ruts
and
through
puddles
the
usual
russian
rural
thoroughfare
not
because
prince
pavlo
wanted
to
give
the
peasants
work
not
because
he
wanted
to
save
them
from
starvation
not
at
all
although
in
the
gratification
of
his
own
whim
he
happened
to
render
those
trifling
services
but
merely
because
he
was
a
great
bárin
a
prince
who
could
have
any
thing
he
desired
had
not
the
other
bárin
steinmetz
by
name
superintended
the
work
steinmetz
the
hated
the
loathed
the
tool
of
the
tyrant
whom
they
never
see
ask
the
starost
the
mayor
of
the
village
he
knows
the
bárins
and
hates
them
michael
roon
the
starosta
or
elder
of
osterno
president
of
the
mir
or
village
council
principal
shopkeeper
mayor
and
only
intelligent
soul
of
the
nine
hundred
probably
had
tartar
blood
in
his
veins
to
this
strain
may
be
attributed
the
narrow
tartar
face
the
keen
black
eyes
the
short
spare
figure
which
many
remember
to
this
day
although
michael
roon
has
been
dead
these
many
years
removed
far
above
the
majority
of
his
in
intelligence
and
energy
this
man
administered
the
law
of
his
own
will
to
his
colleagues
on
the
village
council
it
was
late
in
the
autumn
one
evening
remembered
by
many
for
its
that
the
starosta
was
standing
at
the
door
of
his
small
shop
he
was
apparently
idle
he
never
sold
vodka
and
the
majority
of
the
villagers
were
in
one
of
the
three
thriving
kabaks
which
drove
a
famous
trade
in
strong
drink
and
weak
tea
it
was
a
very
hot
evening
the
sun
had
set
in
a
pink
haze
which
was
now
turning
to
an
unhealthy
gray
and
spreading
over
the
face
of
the
western
sky
like
the
shadow
of
death
across
the
human
countenance
the
starosta
shook
his
head
forebodingly
it
was
cholera
weather
cholera
had
come
to
osterno
had
come
the
starosta
thought
to
stay
it
had
settled
down
in
osterno
and
nothing
but
the
winter
frosts
would
kill
it
when
would
undoubtedly
succeed
it
therefore
the
starosta
shook
his
head
at
the
sunset
and
forgot
to
regret
the
badness
of
the
times
from
a
commercial
point
of
view
he
had
done
all
he
could
he
had
notified
to
the
zemstvo
the
condition
of
his
village
he
had
made
the
usual
appeal
for
help
which
had
been
forwarded
in
the
usual
way
to
tver
where
it
had
apparently
been
received
with
the
usual
philosophic
silence
but
michael
roon
had
also
telegraphed
to
karl
steinmetz
and
since
the
despatch
of
this
message
had
the
starosta
dropped
into
the
habit
of
standing
at
his
doorway
in
the
evening
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
and
his
beady
black
eyes
bent
westward
along
the
on
the
particular
evening
with
which
we
have
to
do
the
beady
eyes
looked
not
in
vain
for
presently
far
along
the
road
appeared
a
black
speck
like
an
insect
crawling
over
the
face
of
a
map
ah
said
the
starosta
ah
he
never
fails
presently
a
neighbor
dropped
in
to
buy
some
of
the
dried
leaf
which
the
starosta
honest
tradesman
called
tea
he
found
the
purveyor
of
cathay
produce
at
the
door
ah
he
said
in
a
voice
thick
with
vodka
you
see
something
on
the
road
yes
a
cart
no
a
carriage
it
moves
too
quickly
a
strange
expression
came
over
the
peasant
face
at
no
time
a
pleasing
physiognomy
the
bloodshot
eyes
flared
up
suddenly
like
a
smouldering
flame
in
brown
paper
the
unsteady
lips
twitched
the
man
threw
up
his
shaggy
head
upon
which
hair
and
beard
mingled
in
unkempt
confusion
he
glared
along
the
road
with
eyes
and
face
aglow
with
a
sullen
hatred
a
carriage
then
it
is
for
the
castle
possibly
answered
the
starosta
the
prince
curse
him
curse
his
mother
soul
curse
his
offspring
yes
said
the
starosta
quietly
yes
curse
him
and
all
his
works
what
is
it
you
want
little
father
tea
he
turned
into
the
shop
and
served
his
customer
duly
inscribing
the
debt
among
others
in
a
rough
cheap
book
the
word
soon
spread
that
a
carriage
was
coming
along
the
road
from
tver
all
the
villagers
came
to
the
doors
of
their
dilapidated
wooden
huts
even
the
kabaks
were
emptied
for
a
time
as
the
vehicle
approached
it
became
apparent
that
the
horses
were
going
at
a
great
pace
not
only
was
the
loose
horse
galloping
but
also
the
pair
in
the
shafts
the
carriage
was
an
open
one
an
ordinary
north
russian
travelling
carriage
not
unlike
the
vehicle
we
call
the
victoria
set
on
high
wheels
beside
the
driver
on
the
box
sat
another
servant
in
the
open
carriage
sat
one
man
only
karl
steinmetz
as
he
passed
through
the
village
a
murmur
of
many
voices
followed
him
not
quite
drowned
by
the
rattle
of
his
wheels
the
clatter
of
the
horses
feet
the
murmur
was
a
curse
karl
steinmetz
heard
it
distinctly
it
made
him
smile
with
a
queer
expression
beneath
his
great
gray
mustache
the
starosta
standing
in
his
saw
the
smile
he
raised
his
voice
with
his
neighbors
and
cursed
as
steinmetz
passed
him
he
gave
a
little
jerk
of
the
head
toward
the
castle
the
jerk
of
the
head
might
have
been
due
to
an
inequality
of
the
road
but
it
might
also
convey
an
appointment
the
keen
haggard
face
of
michael
roon
showed
no
sign
of
mutual
understanding
and
the
carriage
rattled
on
through
the
stricken
village
two
hours
later
when
it
was
quite
dark
a
closed
carriage
with
two
bright
lamps
flaring
into
the
night
passed
through
the
village
toward
the
castle
at
a
gallop
it
is
the
prince
the
peasants
said
crouching
in
their
low
it
is
the
prince
we
know
his
bells
they
are
of
silver
and
we
shall
starve
during
the
winter
curse
him
curse
him
they
raised
their
heads
and
listened
to
the
galloping
feet
with
the
patient
dumb
despair
which
is
the
curse
of
the
slavonic
race
some
of
them
crept
to
their
doors
and
looking
up
saw
that
the
castle
windows
were
ablaze
with
light
if
paul
howard
alexis
was
a
plain
english
gentleman
in
london
he
was
also
a
great
prince
in
his
country
keeping
up
a
princely
state
enjoying
the
gilded
solitude
that
belongs
to
the
his
english
education
had
educed
a
strict
sense
of
discipline
and
as
in
england
and
indeed
all
through
his
life
so
in
russia
did
he
attempt
to
do
his
duty
the
carriage
rattled
up
to
the
brilliantly
lighted
door
which
stood
open
and
within
on
either
side
of
the
broad
the
servants
stood
to
welcome
their
master
a
strange
picturesque
motley
crew
the
majordomo
in
his
black
coat
and
beside
him
the
other
tall
upright
fellows
in
their
bright
livery
beyond
them
the
and
keepers
a
little
army
in
red
cloth
tunics
with
wide
trousers
tucked
into
high
boots
all
holding
their
fur
caps
in
their
hands
standing
stiffly
at
attention
clean
honest
and
not
too
intelligent
the
castle
of
osterno
is
built
on
the
lines
of
many
russian
country
seats
and
not
a
few
palaces
in
moscow
the
royal
palace
in
the
kremlin
is
an
example
a
broad
at
the
back
of
which
a
staircase
as
broad
stretches
up
to
a
gallery
around
which
the
are
situated
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
directly
facing
the
high
folding
doors
disclose
the
which
is
almost
a
throne
room
all
gorgeous
lofty
spacious
as
only
russian
houses
are
truly
this
northern
empire
this
great
white
land
is
a
country
in
which
it
is
good
to
be
an
emperor
a
prince
a
noble
but
not
a
poor
man
paul
passed
through
the
ranks
of
his
retainers
himself
a
head
taller
than
the
tallest
footman
a
few
inches
broader
than
the
sturdiest
keeper
he
acknowledged
the
low
bows
by
a
quick
nod
and
passed
up
the
staircase
steinmetz
in
evening
dress
wearing
the
insignia
of
one
or
two
orders
which
he
had
won
in
the
more
active
days
of
his
earlier
diplomatic
life
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
the
two
men
bowed
gravely
to
each
other
steinmetz
threw
open
the
door
of
the
great
room
and
stood
aside
the
prince
passed
on
and
the
german
followed
him
each
playing
his
part
gravely
as
men
in
high
places
are
called
to
do
when
the
door
was
closed
behind
them
and
they
were
alone
there
was
no
relaxation
no
smile
of
covert
derision
these
men
knew
the
russian
character
thoroughly
there
is
be
it
known
no
more
impressionable
man
on
the
face
of
god
earth
paul
and
steinmetz
had
played
their
parts
so
long
that
these
came
to
be
natural
to
them
as
soon
as
they
passed
the
volga
we
are
all
so
in
a
minor
degree
in
each
house
to
each
of
our
friends
we
are
unconsciously
different
in
some
particular
one
man
holds
us
in
awe
and
we
unconsciously
instil
that
feeling
another
considers
us
a
buffoon
and
lo
we
are
exceedingly
funny
paul
and
steinmetz
knew
that
the
people
around
them
in
osterno
were
somewhat
like
the
dumb
and
driven
beast
these
peasants
required
overawing
by
a
careful
display
of
pomp
an
unrelaxed
dignity
the
line
of
demarcation
between
the
noble
and
the
peasant
is
so
marked
in
the
land
of
the
czar
that
it
is
difficult
for
englishmen
to
realize
or
believe
it
it
is
like
the
line
that
is
drawn
between
us
and
our
dogs
if
we
suppose
it
possible
that
dogs
could
be
taught
to
act
and
think
for
themselves
if
we
take
such
a
development
as
practicable
and
consider
the
possibilities
of
social
upheaval
lying
behind
such
an
education
we
can
in
a
minute
degree
realize
the
problem
which
prince
pavlo
alexis
and
all
his
will
be
called
upon
to
solve
within
the
lifetime
of
men
already
born
chapter
x
the
moscow
doctor
colossal
exclaimed
steinmetz
beneath
his
breath
with
a
little
trick
of
the
tongue
he
transferred
his
cigar
from
the
to
the
corner
of
his
mouth
colossal
l
he
repeated
for
a
moment
paul
looked
up
from
the
papers
spread
out
on
the
table
before
him
looked
with
the
preoccupied
air
of
a
man
who
is
adding
up
something
in
his
mind
then
he
returned
to
his
occupation
he
had
been
at
this
work
for
four
hours
without
a
break
it
was
nearly
one
in
the
morning
since
dinner
karl
steinmetz
had
consumed
no
less
than
five
cigars
while
he
had
not
spoken
five
words
these
two
men
locked
in
a
small
room
in
the
middle
of
the
castle
of
osterno
a
room
with
no
window
but
which
gained
its
light
from
the
clear
heaven
by
a
shaft
and
a
skylight
on
the
roof
locked
in
thus
they
had
been
engaged
in
the
addition
of
an
enormous
mass
of
figures
each
sheet
had
been
carefully
annotated
and
added
by
steinmetz
and
as
each
was
finished
he
handed
it
to
his
companion
is
that
fool
never
coming
asked
paul
with
an
impatient
glance
at
the
clock
our
very
dear
friend
the
starosta
replied
steinmetz
is
no
slave
to
time
he
is
late
the
room
had
the
appearance
of
an
office
there
were
two
safes
square
chests
such
as
we
learn
to
associate
with
the
name
of
griffiths
in
this
country
there
was
a
huge
a
double
table
at
which
paul
and
steinmetz
were
seated
there
were
sundry
stationery
cases
and
an
almanac
or
so
suspended
on
the
walls
which
were
oaken
panels
a
large
white
stove
common
to
all
russian
rooms
stood
against
the
wall
the
room
had
no
less
than
three
doors
with
a
handle
on
no
one
of
them
each
door
opened
with
a
key
like
a
cupboard
steinmetz
had
apparently
finished
his
work
he
was
sitting
back
in
his
chair
contemplating
his
companion
with
a
little
smile
it
apparently
tickled
some
obtuse
teutonic
sense
of
humor
to
see
this
prince
doing
work
which
is
usually
assigned
to
clerks
working
out
statistics
and
abstruse
calculations
as
to
how
much
food
is
required
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
the
silence
of
the
room
was
almost
oppressive
a
russian
village
after
nightfall
is
the
quietest
human
habitation
on
earth
for
the
moujik
the
native
of
a
country
which
will
some
day
supply
the
universe
with
petroleum
can
not
afford
to
light
up
his
humble
abode
and
therefore
sits
in
darkness
had
the
village
of
osterno
possessed
the
liveliness
of
a
spanish
hamlet
the
sound
of
voices
and
laughter
could
not
have
reached
the
castle
perched
high
up
on
the
rock
above
but
osterno
was
asleep
the
castle
servants
had
long
gone
to
rest
and
the
great
silence
of
russia
wrapped
its
wings
over
all
when
therefore
the
clear
coughing
bark
of
a
wolf
was
heard
both
occupants
of
the
little
room
looked
up
the
sound
was
repeated
and
steinmetz
slowly
rose
from
his
seat
i
can
quite
believe
that
our
friend
is
able
to
call
a
wolf
or
a
lynx
to
him
he
said
he
does
it
uncannily
well
i
have
seen
him
do
so
said
paul
without
looking
up
but
it
is
a
common
enough
accomplishment
among
the
keepers
steinmetz
had
left
the
room
before
he
finished
speaking
one
of
the
doors
of
this
little
room
communicated
with
a
large
apartment
used
as
a
secretary
office
and
through
this
by
a
small
staircase
with
a
side
entrance
to
the
castle
by
this
side
entrance
the
stewards
of
the
different
outlying
estates
were
conducted
to
the
presence
of
the
resident
secretary
a
german
selected
and
overawed
by
karl
steinmetz
a
mere
calculating
machine
of
a
man
with
whom
we
have
no
affairs
to
transact
before
many
minutes
had
elapsed
steinmetz
came
back
closely
followed
by
the
starosta
whose
black
eyes
twinkled
and
gleamed
in
the
sudden
light
of
the
lamp
he
dropped
on
his
knees
when
he
saw
paul
suddenly
abjectly
like
an
animal
in
his
dumb
attitude
of
deprecation
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
paul
bade
him
rise
which
the
man
did
standing
back
against
the
panelled
wall
placing
as
great
a
distance
between
himself
and
the
prince
as
the
size
of
the
room
would
allow
well
said
paul
curtly
almost
roughly
i
hear
you
are
in
trouble
in
the
village
the
cholera
has
come
excellency
many
deaths
eleven
paul
looked
up
sharply
and
the
doctor
he
has
not
come
yet
excellency
i
sent
for
him
a
fortnight
ago
the
cholera
is
at
oseff
at
dolja
at
kalisheffa
it
is
everywhere
he
has
forty
thousand
souls
under
his
care
he
has
to
obey
the
zemstvo
to
go
where
they
tell
him
he
takes
no
notice
of
me
yes
interrupted
paul
i
know
and
the
people
themselves
do
they
attempt
to
understand
it
to
follow
out
my
instructions
the
starosta
spread
out
his
thin
hands
in
deprecation
he
cringed
a
little
as
he
stood
he
had
jewish
blood
in
his
veins
which
while
it
raised
him
above
his
fellows
in
osterno
carried
with
it
the
usual
tendency
to
cringe
it
is
in
the
blood
it
is
part
of
what
the
people
who
stood
without
pilate
palace
took
upon
themselves
and
upon
their
children
your
excellency
he
said
knows
what
they
are
it
is
slow
they
make
no
progress
for
them
one
disease
is
as
another
dal
e
bog
vzial
they
say
gave
and
god
took
he
paused
his
black
eyes
flashing
from
one
face
to
the
other
only
the
moscow
doctor
excellency
he
said
significantly
can
manage
them
paul
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
rose
from
his
seat
glancing
at
steinmetz
who
was
looking
on
in
silence
with
his
queer
mocking
smile
i
will
go
with
you
now
he
said
it
is
late
enough
already
the
starosta
bowed
very
low
but
he
said
nothing
paul
went
to
a
cupboard
and
took
from
it
an
old
fur
coat
dragged
at
the
seams
stained
about
the
cuffs
a
dull
brown
doctors
know
the
color
such
stains
have
hanged
a
man
before
now
for
they
are
the
marks
of
blood
paul
put
on
this
coat
he
took
a
long
soft
silken
scarf
such
as
russians
wear
in
winter
and
wrapped
it
round
his
throat
quite
concealing
the
lower
part
of
his
face
he
crammed
a
fur
cap
down
over
his
ears
come
he
said
karl
steinmetz
accompanied
them
down
stairs
carrying
a
lamp
in
one
hand
he
closed
the
door
behind
them
but
did
not
lock
it
then
he
went
upstairs
again
to
the
quiet
little
room
where
he
sat
down
in
a
deep
chair
he
looked
at
the
open
door
of
the
cupboard
from
which
paul
alexis
had
taken
his
simple
disguise
with
a
large
tolerant
humor
el
señor
don
quixote
de
la
mancha
he
said
sleepily
it
is
said
that
to
a
doctor
nothing
is
shocking
and
nothing
is
disgusting
but
doctors
are
after
all
only
men
of
stomach
like
the
rest
of
us
and
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
what
nauseates
one
will
nauseate
the
other
when
the
starosta
unceremoniously
threw
open
the
door
of
the
miserable
cabin
belonging
to
vasilli
tula
paul
gave
a
little
gasp
the
foul
air
pouring
out
of
the
noisome
den
was
such
that
it
seemed
impossible
that
human
lungs
could
assimilate
it
this
vasilli
tula
was
a
notorious
drunkard
a
discontent
a
braggart
the
nihilist
propaganda
had
in
the
early
days
of
that
mistaken
mission
reached
him
and
unsettled
his
discontented
mind
misfortune
seemed
to
pursue
him
in
higher
grades
of
life
than
his
there
are
men
who
like
tula
make
a
profession
of
misfortune
paul
stumbled
down
two
steps
the
cottage
was
dark
the
starosta
had
apparently
trodden
on
a
chicken
which
screamed
shrilly
and
fluttered
about
in
the
dark
with
that
complete
abandon
which
belongs
to
chickens
sheep
and
some
women
have
you
no
light
cried
the
starosta
paul
retreated
to
the
top
step
where
he
had
a
struggle
with
a
calf
which
had
been
living
in
the
room
with
the
family
and
evinced
a
very
creditable
desire
for
fresh
air
yes
yes
we
have
a
little
petroleum
said
a
voice
but
we
have
no
matches
the
starosta
struck
a
light
i
have
brought
the
moscow
doctor
to
see
you
the
moscow
doctor
cried
several
voices
sbogom
sbogom
god
be
with
you
in
the
dim
light
the
whole
of
the
floor
seemed
to
get
up
and
shake
itself
there
were
at
least
seven
persons
sleeping
in
the
hut
two
of
them
did
not
get
up
one
was
dead
the
other
was
dying
of
cholera
a
heavily
built
man
reached
down
from
the
top
of
the
brick
stove
a
cheap
tin
paraffin
lamp
which
he
handed
to
the
starosta
by
the
light
of
this
paul
came
again
into
the
hut
the
floor
was
filthy
as
may
be
imagined
for
beasts
and
human
beings
lived
here
together
the
man
vasilli
tula
threw
himself
down
on
his
knees
clawing
at
paul
coat
with
great
unwashed
hands
whining
out
a
tale
of
sorrow
and
misfortune
in
a
moment
they
were
all
on
their
knees
clinging
to
him
crying
to
him
for
help
tula
himself
a
slav
of
fifty
or
thereabouts
his
wife
haggard
emaciated
horrible
to
look
upon
for
she
was
toothless
and
almost
blind
two
women
and
a
loutish
boy
of
sixteen
paul
pushed
his
way
not
unkindly
toward
the
corner
where
the
two
motionless
forms
lay
half
concealed
by
a
mass
of
ragged
sheepskin
here
he
said
this
woman
is
dead
take
her
out
when
will
you
learn
to
be
clean
this
boy
may
live
with
care
bring
the
light
closer
little
mother
so
it
is
well
he
will
live
come
do
sit
crying
take
all
these
rags
out
and
burn
them
all
of
you
go
out
it
is
a
fine
night
you
are
better
in
the
than
here
here
you
tula
go
round
with
the
starosta
to
his
store
he
will
give
you
clean
blankets
they
obeyed
him
blindly
tula
and
one
of
the
young
women
his
daughters
dragged
the
dead
body
which
was
that
of
a
very
old
woman
out
into
the
night
the
starosta
had
retired
to
the
when
the
lamp
was
lighted
his
courage
having
failed
him
the
air
was
foul
with
the
reek
of
smoke
and
filth
and
infection
come
vasilli
tula
the
village
elder
said
with
suspicious
eagerness
come
with
me
i
will
give
you
what
the
good
doctor
says
though
you
owe
me
money
and
you
never
try
to
pay
me
but
tula
was
kissing
and
mumbling
over
the
hem
of
paul
coat
paul
took
no
notice
of
him
we
are
starving
excellency
the
man
was
saying
i
can
get
no
work
i
had
to
sell
my
horse
in
the
winter
and
i
can
not
plough
my
little
piece
of
land
the
government
will
not
help
us
the
prince
curse
him
does
nothing
for
us
he
lives
in
petersburg
where
he
spends
all
his
money
and
has
food
and
wine
more
than
he
wants
the
count
stépan
lanovitch
used
to
assist
us
god
be
with
him
but
he
has
been
sent
to
siberia
because
he
helped
the
peasants
he
was
like
you
he
was
a
great
bárin
a
great
noble
and
yet
he
helped
the
peasants
paul
turned
round
sharply
and
shook
the
man
off
go
he
said
with
the
starosta
and
get
what
i
tell
you
a
great
strong
fellow
like
you
has
no
business
on
his
knees
to
any
man
i
will
not
help
you
unless
you
help
yourself
you
are
a
lazy
get
out
he
pushed
him
out
of
the
hut
and
kicked
after
him
a
few
rags
of
clothing
which
were
lying
about
on
the
floor
all
filthy
and
slimy
good
god
muttered
he
under
his
breath
in
english
that
a
place
like
this
should
exist
beneath
the
very
walls
of
osterno
from
hut
to
hut
he
went
all
through
that
night
on
his
mission
of
mercy
without
enthusiasm
without
notions
respecting
mankind
but
with
the
simple
sense
of
duty
that
was
his
these
people
were
his
things
his
dumb
and
driven
beasts
in
his
heart
there
may
have
existed
a
grudge
against
the
almighty
for
placing
him
in
a
position
which
was
not
only
intensely
disagreeable
but
also
somewhat
ridiculous
for
he
did
not
dare
to
tell
his
friends
of
these
things
he
had
spoken
of
them
to
no
man
except
karl
steinmetz
who
was
in
a
sense
his
dependent
english
public
school
and
university
had
instilled
into
him
the
intensely
british
feeling
of
shame
respecting
good
works
he
could
take
chaff
as
well
as
any
man
for
he
was
grave
by
habit
and
a
grave
man
receives
the
most
chaff
most
but
he
had
a
nervous
dread
of
being
found
out
he
had
made
a
sort
of
religion
of
suppressing
the
fact
that
he
was
a
prince
the
holy
of
holies
of
this
cult
was
the
fact
that
he
was
a
prince
who
sought
to
do
good
to
his
neighbor
a
prince
in
whom
one
might
repose
trust
this
was
not
the
first
time
by
any
number
that
he
had
gone
down
into
his
own
village
insisting
in
a
way
on
cleanliness
and
purity
the
moscow
doctor
the
peasants
would
say
in
the
kabak
over
their
vodka
and
their
tea
the
moscow
doctor
comes
in
and
kicks
our
beds
out
of
the
door
he
comes
in
and
throws
our
furniture
into
the
street
but
afterward
he
gives
us
new
beds
and
new
furniture
it
was
a
joke
that
always
obtained
in
the
kabak
it
flavored
the
vodka
and
with
that
fiery
poison
served
to
raise
a
laugh
the
moscow
doctor
was
looked
upon
in
osterno
and
in
many
neighboring
villages
as
second
only
to
god
in
fact
many
of
the
peasants
placed
him
before
their
creator
they
were
stupid
hapless
men
the
moscow
doctor
they
could
see
for
themselves
he
came
in
a
very
tangible
thing
of
flesh
and
blood
built
on
a
large
and
manly
scale
he
took
them
by
the
shoulders
and
bundled
them
out
of
their
own
houses
kicking
their
bedding
after
them
he
scolded
them
he
rated
them
and
abused
them
he
brought
them
food
and
medicine
he
understood
the
diseases
which
from
time
to
time
swept
over
their
villages
no
cold
was
too
intense
for
him
to
brave
should
they
be
in
distress
he
asked
no
money
and
he
gave
none
but
they
lived
on
his
charity
and
they
were
wise
enough
to
know
it
what
wonder
if
these
poor
wretches
loved
the
man
whom
they
could
see
and
hear
above
the
god
who
manifested
himself
to
them
in
no
way
the
orthodox
priests
of
their
villages
had
no
money
to
spend
on
their
parishioners
on
the
contrary
they
asked
for
money
to
keep
the
churches
in
repair
what
wonder
then
if
these
poor
ignorant
helpless
peasants
would
listen
to
no
priest
for
the
priest
could
not
explain
to
them
why
it
was
that
god
sent
a
winter
which
cut
them
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
behind
impassable
barriers
of
snow
that
god
sent
them
droughts
in
the
summer
so
that
there
was
no
crop
of
rye
that
god
scourged
them
with
dread
and
horrible
disease
it
is
almost
impossible
for
us
to
realize
in
these
days
of
a
lamentably
cheap
press
and
a
cheaper
literature
the
mental
condition
of
men
and
women
who
have
no
education
no
newspaper
no
news
of
the
world
no
communication
with
the
universe
to
them
the
mystery
of
the
moscow
doctor
was
as
incomprehensible
as
to
us
is
the
deity
they
were
so
near
to
the
animals
that
paul
could
not
succeed
in
teaching
them
that
disease
and
death
followed
on
the
heels
of
dirt
and
neglect
they
were
too
ignorant
to
reason
too
low
down
the
animal
scale
to
comprehend
things
which
some
of
the
dumb
animals
undoubtedly
recognize
paul
alexis
half
russian
half
english
understood
these
people
very
thoroughly
he
took
advantage
of
their
ignorance
their
simplicity
their
unfathomable
superstition
he
governed
as
no
other
could
have
ruled
them
by
fear
and
kindness
at
once
he
mastered
them
by
his
vitality
the
wholesome
strength
of
his
nature
his
infinite
superiority
he
avoided
the
terrible
mistake
of
the
nihilists
by
treating
them
as
children
to
whom
education
must
be
given
little
by
little
instead
of
throwing
down
before
them
a
mass
of
dangerous
knowledge
which
their
minds
unaccustomed
to
such
strong
food
are
incapable
of
digesting
a
british
coldness
of
blood
damped
as
it
were
the
russian
quixotism
which
would
desire
to
see
result
follow
upon
action
to
see
the
world
make
quicker
progress
than
its
creator
has
decreed
with
very
unsatisfactory
material
paul
was
setting
in
motion
a
great
rock
which
will
roll
down
into
the
ages
unconnected
with
his
name
clearing
a
path
through
a
very
thick
forest
of
ignorance
and
tyranny
chapter
xi
catrina
the
man
who
carries
a
deceit
however
innocent
with
him
through
life
is
apt
to
be
somewhat
handicapped
in
that
unfair
competition
he
is
like
a
ship
at
sea
with
a
sprung
mainmast
a
side
breeze
may
arise
at
any
moment
which
throws
him
all
aback
and
upon
his
he
runs
illegitimate
risks
which
are
things
much
given
to
dragging
at
a
mind
handicapping
his
thoughts
paul
suffered
in
this
way
it
was
a
distinct
burthen
to
him
to
play
a
double
part
although
each
was
innocent
enough
in
itself
at
school
and
later
on
at
the
he
had
consistently
and
steadily
suppressed
a
truth
from
friend
and
foe
alike
namely
that
he
was
in
his
own
country
a
prince
no
great
crime
on
the
face
of
it
but
a
constant
suppression
of
a
very
small
truth
is
as
burdensome
as
any
suggestion
of
falsehood
it
makes
one
afraid
of
contemptible
foes
and
doubtful
of
the
value
of
one
own
friendship
paul
was
a
man
he
was
not
afraid
of
the
russian
government
indeed
he
cultivated
a
fine
contempt
for
that
august
body
but
he
was
distinctly
afraid
of
being
found
out
for
that
discovery
could
only
mean
an
incontinent
cessation
of
the
good
work
which
rendered
his
life
happy
the
fear
of
being
deprived
of
this
interest
in
existence
should
certainly
have
been
lessened
if
not
quite
allayed
by
the
fact
that
a
greater
interest
had
been
brought
into
his
life
in
the
pleasant
form
of
a
prospective
wife
when
he
was
in
london
with
etta
sydney
bamborough
he
did
not
however
forget
osterno
he
only
longed
for
the
time
when
he
could
take
etta
freely
into
his
confidence
and
engage
her
interest
in
the
object
of
his
ambition
namely
to
make
the
huge
osterno
estate
into
that
lump
of
leaven
which
might
in
time
leaven
the
whole
of
the
empire
that
a
man
is
capable
of
sustaining
two
absorbing
interests
at
once
is
a
matter
of
illustration
are
we
not
surrounded
by
men
who
do
their
work
well
in
life
and
love
their
wives
well
at
home
without
allowing
the
one
to
interfere
with
the
other
that
women
are
capable
of
the
same
seems
exceedingly
probable
but
we
are
a
race
of
sheep
who
run
after
each
other
guided
for
the
moment
by
a
catchword
which
will
not
bear
investigation
or
an
erroneous
deduction
set
in
alliterative
verse
which
clings
to
the
mind
and
sways
it
thus
we
all
think
that
whole
existence
is
and
is
only
capable
of
love
because
a
poet
in
the
trickiness
of
his
trade
once
said
so
now
paul
held
a
different
opinion
he
thought
that
etta
could
manage
to
love
him
well
as
she
said
she
did
and
yet
take
an
interest
in
that
which
was
in
reality
the
object
of
his
life
he
intended
to
take
the
earliest
opportunity
of
telling
her
all
about
the
work
he
was
endeavoring
to
carry
out
at
osterno
and
the
knowledge
that
he
was
withholding
something
from
her
was
a
constant
burden
to
an
upright
and
honest
nature
i
think
he
said
one
morning
to
steinmetz
that
i
will
write
and
tell
sydney
bamborough
all
about
this
place
i
should
not
do
that
replied
steinmetz
with
a
leisurely
promptitude
they
were
alone
in
a
great
of
which
the
walls
were
hung
all
round
with
hunting
trophies
paul
was
smoking
a
cigar
steinmetz
reflected
gravely
over
a
pipe
they
were
both
reading
russian
newspapers
periodicals
chiefly
remarkable
for
that
which
they
leave
unsaid
why
not
asked
paul
on
principle
never
tell
a
woman
that
which
is
not
interesting
enough
to
magnify
into
a
secret
paul
turned
over
his
newspaper
he
began
reading
again
then
suddenly
he
looked
up
we
are
engaged
to
be
married
he
observed
pointedly
steinmetz
took
his
pipe
from
his
lips
slowly
and
imperturbably
he
was
a
man
to
whom
it
was
no
satisfaction
to
impart
news
he
either
knew
it
before
or
did
not
take
much
interest
in
the
matter
that
makes
it
worse
he
said
a
woman
only
conceals
what
is
bad
about
her
husband
if
she
knows
anything
that
is
likely
to
make
other
women
think
that
their
husbands
are
inferior
she
will
tell
it
paul
laughed
but
this
is
not
good
he
argued
we
have
kept
it
so
confoundedly
quiet
that
i
am
beginning
to
feel
as
if
it
is
a
crime
steinmetz
uncrossed
his
legs
crossed
them
again
and
then
spoke
after
mature
reflection
as
i
understand
the
law
of
libel
a
man
is
punished
not
for
telling
a
lie
but
for
telling
either
the
truth
or
a
lie
with
malicious
intent
i
imagine
the
almighty
will
take
the
intent
into
consideration
if
human
justice
finds
it
expedient
to
do
so
paul
shrugged
his
shoulders
argument
was
not
his
strong
point
and
like
most
men
who
can
not
argue
he
was
almost
impervious
to
the
arguments
of
others
he
recognized
the
necessity
for
secrecy
the
absolute
need
of
a
thousand
little
secretive
precautions
and
disguises
which
were
intensely
disagreeable
to
him
but
he
also
grumbled
at
them
freely
and
whenever
he
made
such
objection
karl
steinmetz
grew
uneasy
as
if
the
question
which
he
disposed
of
with
facile
philosophy
or
humorous
resignation
had
behind
it
a
possibility
and
an
importance
of
which
he
was
fully
aware
it
was
on
these
rare
occasions
that
he
might
have
conveyed
to
a
keen
observer
the
impression
that
he
was
playing
a
very
dangerous
game
with
a
smiling
countenance
all
that
we
do
pursued
steinmetz
is
to
bow
to
a
lamentable
necessity
for
deceit
i
have
bowed
to
it
all
my
life
it
has
been
my
trade
perhaps
it
is
not
our
fault
that
we
are
placed
in
charge
of
four
or
five
thousand
human
beings
who
are
no
more
capable
of
helping
themselves
than
are
sheep
it
is
not
our
fault
that
the
forefathers
of
these
sheep
cut
down
the
forests
and
omitted
to
plant
more
so
that
the
flocks
with
whom
we
have
to
deal
have
no
fuel
it
is
not
our
fault
that
a
most
terrific
winter
annually
renders
the
land
unproductive
for
four
months
it
is
not
our
fault
that
the
government
to
which
we
are
forced
to
bow
the
czar
whose
name
lifts
our
hats
from
our
heads
it
is
not
our
fault
that
progress
and
education
are
taboo
and
that
all
who
endeavor
to
forward
the
cause
of
humanity
are
promptly
put
away
in
a
safe
place
where
they
are
at
liberty
to
forward
their
own
salvation
and
nothing
else
nothing
is
our
fault
mein
lieber
in
this
country
we
have
to
make
the
best
of
adverse
circumstances
we
are
not
breaking
any
human
law
and
in
doing
nothing
we
should
be
breaking
a
divine
command
paul
flicked
the
ash
off
his
cigar
he
had
heard
all
this
before
karl
steinmetz
words
were
usually
more
remarkable
for
solid
thoughtfulness
than
for
brilliancy
of
conception
or
any
great
novelty
of
expression
oh
said
paul
quietly
i
am
not
going
to
leave
off
you
need
not
fear
that
only
i
shall
have
to
tell
my
wife
surely
a
woman
could
help
us
in
a
thousand
ways
there
is
such
a
lot
that
only
a
woman
understands
yes
grunted
steinmetz
and
only
the
right
sort
of
woman
paul
looked
up
sharply
you
must
leave
that
to
me
he
said
my
very
dear
friend
i
leave
every
thing
to
you
paul
smiled
there
was
no
positive
proof
that
this
was
not
strictly
true
there
was
no
saying
that
karl
steinmetz
did
not
leave
every
thing
to
but
wise
people
thought
differently
you
do
know
etta
he
said
half
shyly
she
is
full
of
sympathy
and
pity
for
these
people
steinmetz
bowed
gravely
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
and
yet
you
say
that
she
must
not
be
told
certainly
not
a
secret
is
considerably
strained
if
it
be
divided
between
two
people
stretching
it
to
three
will
probably
break
it
you
can
tell
her
when
you
are
married
does
she
consent
to
live
in
osterno
oh
yes
i
think
so
um
m
what
did
you
say
um
m
repeated
steinmetz
and
the
conversation
somewhat
naturally
showed
signs
of
collapse
at
this
moment
the
door
was
opened
and
a
servant
in
bright
livery
with
powdered
wig
silk
stockings
and
a
countenance
which
might
have
been
of
wood
brought
in
a
letter
on
a
silver
tray
paul
took
the
square
envelope
and
turned
it
over
displaying
as
he
did
so
a
coronet
in
black
and
gold
on
the
corner
like
a
stamp
karl
steinmetz
saw
the
coronet
he
never
took
his
quiet
unobtrusive
glance
from
paul
face
while
he
opened
the
letter
and
read
it
a
fresh
difficulty
said
paul
throwing
the
note
across
to
his
companion
steinmetz
looked
grave
while
he
unfolded
the
thick
stationery
dear
paul
the
letter
ran
i
hear
you
are
at
osterno
and
that
the
moscow
doctor
is
in
your
country
we
are
in
great
distress
at
thors
cholera
i
fear
the
fame
of
your
doctor
has
spread
to
my
people
and
they
are
clamoring
for
him
can
you
bring
or
send
him
over
you
know
your
room
here
is
always
in
readiness
come
soon
with
the
great
doctor
and
also
herr
steinmetz
in
doing
so
you
will
give
more
than
pleasure
to
your
old
friend
catrina
lanovitch
mother
is
afraid
to
go
out
of
doors
for
fear
of
infection
she
thinks
she
has
a
little
cold
steinmetz
folded
the
letter
very
carefully
pressing
the
seam
of
it
reflectively
with
his
stout
forefinger
and
thumb
i
always
think
of
the
lie
first
he
said
it
my
nature
or
my
misfortune
we
can
easily
write
and
say
that
the
moscow
doctor
has
left
he
paused
scratching
his
brow
pensively
with
his
curved
forefinger
it
is
to
be
feared
that
he
was
seeking
not
so
much
the
truth
as
the
most
convenient
perversion
of
the
same
but
then
he
went
on
by
doing
that
we
leave
these
poor
devils
to
die
in
their
styes
catrina
can
not
manage
them
they
are
worse
than
our
people
whatever
is
the
best
lie
to
tell
burst
in
paul
as
we
seem
to
live
in
an
atmosphere
of
them
i
must
go
to
thors
that
is
quite
certain
there
is
no
must
in
the
case
put
in
steinmetz
quietly
as
a
parenthesis
no
man
is
compelled
to
throw
himself
in
the
way
of
infection
but
i
know
you
will
go
whatever
i
say
i
suppose
i
shall
admitted
paul
and
catrina
will
find
you
out
at
once
why
steinmetz
drew
in
his
feet
he
leant
forward
and
knocked
his
pipe
on
one
of
the
logs
that
lay
ready
to
light
in
the
great
open
because
she
loves
you
he
said
shortly
there
is
no
coming
the
moscow
doctor
over
her
mien
lieber
paul
laughed
rather
awkwardly
he
was
one
of
the
few
men
daily
growing
fewer
who
hold
that
a
woman
love
is
not
a
thing
to
be
tossed
lightly
about
in
conversation
then
he
began
speaking
rather
quickly
as
if
afraid
that
steinmetz
was
going
to
say
more
if
he
amended
you
think
she
will
find
out
she
must
not
see
me
that
is
all
steinmetz
reflected
again
he
was
unusually
grave
over
this
matter
one
would
scarcely
have
taken
this
stout
german
for
a
person
of
any
sentiment
whatever
nevertheless
he
would
have
liked
paul
to
marry
catrina
lanovitch
in
preference
to
etta
sydney
bamborough
merely
because
he
thought
that
the
former
loved
him
while
he
felt
sure
that
the
latter
did
not
so
much
for
the
sentimental
point
of
view
a
by
the
way
which
usually
makes
all
the
difference
in
a
man
life
for
a
man
needs
to
be
loved
as
much
as
a
woman
needs
it
from
the
practical
point
of
view
karl
steinmetz
knew
too
much
about
etta
to
place
entire
reliance
on
the
goodness
of
her
motives
he
keenly
suspected
that
she
was
marrying
paul
for
his
money
for
the
position
he
could
give
her
in
the
world
we
must
be
careful
he
said
we
must
place
clearly
before
ourselves
the
risks
that
we
are
running
before
we
come
to
any
decision
for
you
the
risk
is
simply
that
of
unofficial
banishment
they
can
hardly
send
you
to
siberia
because
you
are
half
an
englishman
and
that
impertinent
country
has
a
habit
of
getting
up
and
shouting
when
her
sons
are
interfered
with
but
they
can
easily
make
russia
impossible
for
you
they
can
do
you
more
harm
than
you
think
they
can
do
these
poor
devils
of
peasants
of
yours
more
harm
than
we
can
comfortably
contemplate
as
for
me
he
paused
and
shrugged
his
great
shoulders
it
means
siberia
already
i
am
a
suspect
a
persona
non
grata
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
refuse
to
help
catrina
said
paul
in
a
voice
which
steinmetz
seemed
to
know
for
he
suddenly
gave
in
as
you
will
he
said
he
sat
up
and
drawing
a
small
table
toward
him
took
up
a
pen
reflectively
paul
watched
him
in
silence
when
the
letter
was
finished
steinmetz
read
it
aloud
my
dear
catrina
the
moscow
doctor
and
your
obedient
servant
will
be
in
thors
by
seven
we
propose
spending
about
an
hour
in
the
village
if
you
will
kindly
advise
the
starosta
to
be
ready
for
us
as
our
time
is
limited
and
we
are
much
needed
in
osterno
we
shall
have
to
deprive
ourselves
of
the
pleasure
of
calling
at
the
castle
the
prince
sends
kind
remembrances
and
proposes
riding
over
to
thors
to
avail
himself
of
your
proffered
hospitality
in
a
day
or
two
with
salutations
to
the
countess
your
old
friend
karl
steinmetz
steinmetz
waited
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
for
paul
approval
you
see
he
explained
you
are
notoriously
indifferent
to
the
welfare
of
the
peasants
it
would
be
unnatural
if
you
suddenly
displayed
so
much
interest
as
to
induce
you
to
go
to
thors
on
a
mission
of
charity
paul
nodded
all
right
he
said
yes
i
see
though
i
confess
i
sometimes
forget
what
the
deuce
i
supposed
to
be
steinmetz
laughed
pleasantly
as
he
folded
the
letter
he
rose
and
went
to
the
door
i
will
send
it
off
he
said
he
paused
on
the
threshold
and
looked
back
gravely
do
not
forget
he
added
that
catrina
lanovitch
loves
you
chapter
xii
at
thors
below
the
windows
of
a
long
low
stone
house
in
its
architecture
remarkably
like
a
fortified
farm
below
these
windows
the
river
oster
mumbled
softly
one
of
the
windows
was
wide
open
and
with
the
voice
of
the
water
a
wonderful
music
rolled
out
to
mingle
and
lose
itself
in
the
hum
of
the
the
room
was
a
small
one
beneath
the
artistic
one
detected
the
outline
of
stones
there
were
women
things
lying
about
there
were
flowers
in
a
bowl
on
a
low
strong
table
there
were
a
few
good
engravings
on
the
wall
windows
low
chairs
a
sofa
a
fan
but
it
was
not
a
womanly
room
the
music
filling
it
vibrating
back
from
the
grim
stone
walls
was
not
womanly
music
it
was
more
than
manly
it
was
not
earthly
but
almost
divine
it
happened
to
be
grieg
with
the
halting
beat
of
a
disabled
perhaps
a
broken
heart
in
it
as
that
master
music
usually
has
the
girl
was
alone
in
the
room
the
presence
of
any
one
would
have
silenced
something
that
was
throbbing
at
the
back
of
the
chords
quite
suddenly
she
stopped
she
knew
how
to
play
the
quaint
last
notes
she
knew
something
that
no
master
had
ever
taught
her
she
swung
round
on
the
stool
and
faced
the
light
it
was
afternoon
an
autumn
afternoon
in
russia
and
the
pink
light
made
the
very
best
of
a
face
which
was
not
beautiful
at
all
never
could
be
beautiful
a
face
about
which
even
the
owner
a
woman
could
have
no
possible
illusion
it
was
broad
and
powerful
with
eyes
too
far
apart
forehead
too
broad
and
low
jaw
too
heavy
mouth
too
determined
the
eyes
were
and
slightly
sloping
downward
and
inward
deep
passionate
blue
eyes
set
in
a
mongolian
head
it
was
the
face
of
a
woman
who
could
morally
speaking
make
mincemeat
of
nine
young
men
out
of
ten
but
she
could
not
have
made
one
out
of
the
number
love
her
for
it
has
been
decreed
that
women
shall
win
love
except
in
some
happy
exceptions
by
beauty
only
the
same
unwritten
law
has
it
that
a
man
appearance
does
not
matter
a
law
much
appreciated
by
some
of
us
and
duly
canonized
by
not
a
few
the
girl
was
evidently
listening
she
glanced
at
a
little
golden
clock
on
the
and
then
at
the
open
window
she
rose
she
was
short
and
somewhat
broadly
built
and
went
to
the
window
he
will
be
back
she
said
to
herself
in
a
few
minutes
now
she
raised
her
hand
to
her
forehead
and
pressed
back
her
hair
with
a
little
movement
of
impatience
expressive
perhaps
of
a
great
suspense
she
stood
idly
drumming
on
the
for
a
few
moments
then
with
a
quick
little
sigh
she
went
back
to
the
piano
as
she
moved
she
gave
a
jerk
of
the
head
from
time
to
time
as
schoolgirls
who
have
too
much
hair
are
wont
to
do
the
reason
of
this
nervous
movement
was
a
wondrous
plait
of
gold
reaching
far
below
her
waist
catrina
lanovitch
almost
worshipped
her
own
hair
she
knew
without
any
doubt
that
not
one
woman
in
ten
thousand
could
rival
her
in
this
feminine
glory
knew
it
as
indubitably
as
she
knew
that
she
was
plain
the
latter
fact
she
faced
with
an
unflinching
cold
conviction
which
was
not
feminine
at
all
she
did
not
say
that
she
was
hideous
for
the
sake
of
hearing
a
contradiction
or
a
series
of
saving
clauses
she
never
spoke
of
it
to
any
one
she
had
grown
up
with
it
and
as
it
was
beyond
doubt
so
was
it
outside
discussion
all
her
femininity
seemed
to
be
concentrated
all
her
vanity
centred
on
her
hair
it
was
her
one
pride
perhaps
her
one
hope
women
have
been
loved
for
their
voices
catrina
voice
was
musical
enough
but
it
was
deep
and
strong
it
was
passionate
tender
if
she
wished
fascinating
but
it
was
not
lovable
if
the
voice
may
win
love
why
not
the
hair
catrina
despised
all
men
but
one
that
one
she
worshipped
she
lived
night
and
day
with
one
great
desire
beside
which
heaven
and
hell
were
mere
words
neither
the
hope
of
the
one
nor
the
fear
of
the
other
in
any
way
touched
or
affected
her
desire
she
wanted
to
make
paul
alexis
love
her
and
womanlike
she
clung
to
the
one
womanly
charm
that
was
hers
the
wonderful
golden
hair
pathetic
aye
pathetic
with
a
grin
behind
the
pathos
as
there
ever
is
she
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
her
strong
small
hands
tore
the
heart
out
of
each
wire
there
are
some
people
who
get
farther
into
a
piano
than
others
making
the
wires
speak
as
with
a
voice
catrina
lanovitch
had
this
trick
she
only
played
a
russian
a
simple
lay
such
as
one
may
hear
issuing
from
the
door
of
any
kabak
on
a
summer
evening
but
she
infused
a
true
russian
soul
into
it
the
soul
that
is
cursed
with
a
fatal
power
of
dumb
and
patient
endurance
she
did
not
sway
from
side
to
side
as
do
some
people
who
lose
themselves
in
the
intoxication
of
music
but
she
sat
quite
upright
her
sturdy
square
shoulders
motionless
her
strange
eyes
were
fixed
with
the
stillness
of
distant
contemplation
suddenly
she
stopped
and
leaped
to
her
feet
she
did
not
go
to
the
window
but
stood
listening
beside
the
piano
the
beat
of
a
hoofs
on
the
narrow
road
was
distinctly
audible
hollow
and
sodden
as
is
the
sound
of
a
wooden
road
it
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
a
certain
unsteadiness
indicated
that
the
horse
was
tired
i
thought
he
might
have
come
she
whispered
and
she
sat
down
breathlessly
when
the
servant
came
into
the
room
a
few
minutes
later
catrina
was
at
the
piano
a
letter
mademoiselle
said
the
maid
lay
it
on
the
table
answered
catrina
without
looking
round
she
was
playing
the
closing
bars
of
a
nocturne
she
rose
slowly
turned
and
seized
the
letter
as
a
starving
man
seizes
food
there
was
something
almost
in
her
eyes
steinmetz
she
exclaimed
reading
the
address
steinmetz
oh
why
wo
he
write
to
me
she
tore
open
the
letter
read
it
and
stood
holding
it
in
her
hand
looking
out
over
the
trackless
with
absorbed
speculative
eyes
the
sun
had
just
set
the
farthest
ridge
of
stood
out
like
the
teeth
of
a
saw
in
black
relief
on
the
rosy
sky
catrina
lanovitch
watched
the
rosiness
fade
into
pearly
gray
madame
the
countess
awaits
mademoiselle
for
tea
said
the
maid
voice
suddenly
in
the
gloom
of
the
i
will
come
the
village
of
thors
twenty
miles
farther
down
the
river
oster
twenty
miles
nearer
to
the
junction
of
that
river
with
the
volga
was
little
more
than
a
hamlet
in
the
days
of
which
we
write
some
day
perhaps
the
three
hundred
souls
of
thors
may
increase
and
multiply
some
day
when
russia
is
attacked
by
the
railway
fever
for
thors
is
on
the
the
belt
of
black
and
fertile
soil
that
runs
right
across
the
vast
empire
karl
steinmetz
a
dogged
watcher
of
the
wandering
jew
the
deathless
scoffer
at
our
lord
agony
who
shall
never
die
who
shall
leave
cholera
in
his
track
wherever
he
may
wander
karl
steinmetz
knew
that
the
oster
was
in
itself
a
wandering
jew
this
river
meandered
through
the
lonesome
country
bearing
cholera
germs
within
its
waters
whenever
osterno
had
cholera
it
sent
it
down
the
river
to
thors
and
so
on
to
the
volga
thors
lay
groaning
under
the
scourge
and
the
countess
lanovitch
shut
herself
within
her
stone
walls
shivering
with
fear
begging
her
daughter
to
return
to
petersburg
it
was
nearly
dark
when
karl
steinmetz
and
the
moscow
doctor
rode
into
the
little
village
to
find
the
starosta
a
simple
russian
farmer
awaiting
them
outside
the
kabak
steinmetz
knew
the
man
and
immediately
took
command
of
the
situation
with
that
unquestioned
sense
of
authority
which
in
russia
places
the
bárin
on
much
the
same
footing
as
that
taken
by
the
in
our
eastern
empire
now
starosta
he
said
we
have
only
an
hour
to
spend
in
thors
this
is
the
moscow
doctor
if
you
listen
to
what
he
tells
you
you
will
soon
have
no
sickness
in
the
village
the
worst
houses
first
and
quickly
you
need
not
be
afraid
but
if
you
do
not
care
to
come
in
you
may
stay
outside
as
they
walked
down
the
straggling
the
moscow
doctor
told
the
starosta
in
no
measured
terms
as
was
his
wont
wherein
lay
the
heart
of
the
sickness
here
as
in
osterno
dirt
and
neglect
were
at
the
base
of
all
the
trouble
here
as
in
the
larger
village
the
houses
were
more
like
the
abode
of
beasts
than
the
dwellings
of
human
beings
the
starosta
prudently
remained
outside
the
first
house
to
which
he
introduced
the
visitors
paul
went
fearlessly
in
while
steinmetz
stood
in
the
holding
open
the
door
as
he
was
standing
there
he
perceived
a
flickering
light
approaching
him
the
light
was
evidently
that
of
an
ordinary
and
from
the
swinging
motion
it
was
easy
to
divine
that
it
was
being
carried
by
some
one
who
was
walking
quickly
who
is
this
asked
steinmetz
it
is
likely
to
be
the
countess
catrina
excellency
steinmetz
glanced
back
into
the
cottage
which
was
dark
save
for
the
light
of
a
single
petroleum
lamp
paul
huge
form
could
be
dimly
distinguished
bending
over
a
heap
of
humanity
and
foul
clothing
in
a
corner
does
she
visit
the
cottages
asked
steinmetz
sharply
she
does
god
be
with
her
she
has
no
fear
she
is
an
angel
without
her
we
should
all
be
dead
she
wo
visit
this
if
i
can
help
it
muttered
steinmetz
the
light
flickered
along
the
road
toward
them
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
it
fell
on
the
stricken
cottage
on
the
starosta
standing
in
the
road
on
steinmetz
in
the
herr
steinmetz
is
that
you
asked
a
voice
deep
and
musical
in
the
darkness
zum
befehl
answered
steinmetz
without
moving
catrina
came
up
to
him
she
was
clad
in
a
long
dark
cloak
a
dark
hat
and
wore
no
gloves
she
brought
with
her
a
clean
aromatic
odor
of
disinfectants
she
carried
the
lantern
herself
while
behind
her
walked
a
in
livery
with
a
large
basket
in
either
hand
it
is
good
of
you
she
said
to
come
to
us
in
our
need
also
to
persuade
the
good
doctor
to
come
with
you
it
is
not
much
that
we
can
do
answered
steinmetz
taking
the
small
outstretched
hand
within
his
large
soft
grasp
but
that
little
you
may
always
count
upon
i
know
she
said
gravely
she
looked
up
at
him
expecting
him
to
step
aside
and
allow
her
to
pass
into
the
cottage
but
steinmetz
stood
quite
still
looking
down
at
her
with
his
pleasant
smile
and
how
is
it
with
you
he
asked
speaking
in
german
as
they
always
did
together
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
oh
she
answered
indifferently
i
am
well
of
course
i
always
am
i
have
the
strength
of
a
horse
of
course
i
have
been
troubled
about
these
poor
people
it
has
been
terrible
they
are
worse
than
children
i
can
not
quite
understand
why
god
afflicts
them
so
they
have
never
done
any
harm
they
are
not
like
the
jews
it
seems
unjust
i
have
been
very
busy
in
my
small
way
my
mother
you
know
does
not
take
much
interest
in
things
that
are
not
clean
madame
the
countess
reads
french
novels
and
the
fictional
productions
of
some
modern
english
ladies
suggested
steinmetz
quietly
yes
but
she
objects
to
honest
dirt
said
catrina
coldly
may
i
go
in
steinmetz
did
not
move
i
think
not
this
moscow
man
is
eccentric
he
likes
to
do
good
sub
rosa
he
prefers
to
be
alone
catrina
tried
to
look
into
the
cottage
but
karl
steinmetz
as
we
know
was
fat
and
filled
up
the
whole
i
should
like
to
thank
him
for
coming
to
us
or
at
least
to
offer
him
hospitality
i
suppose
one
can
not
pay
him
no
one
can
not
pay
him
answered
steinmetz
gravely
there
was
a
little
pause
from
the
interior
of
the
cottage
came
the
murmured
gratitude
of
the
peasants
broken
at
times
by
a
wail
of
agony
the
wail
of
a
man
it
is
not
a
pleasant
sound
to
hear
catrina
heard
it
and
it
twisted
her
plain
strong
face
in
a
sudden
spasm
of
sympathy
again
she
made
an
impatient
little
movement
let
me
go
in
she
urged
i
may
be
able
to
help
steinmetz
shook
his
head
better
not
he
said
besides
your
life
is
too
precious
to
these
poor
people
to
run
unnecessary
risks
she
gave
a
strange
bitter
laugh
and
what
about
you
she
said
and
paul
you
never
hear
of
paul
going
into
any
of
the
cottages
snapped
steinmetz
sharply
for
me
it
is
different
you
have
never
heard
that
of
paul
no
she
answered
slowly
and
it
is
quite
right
his
life
it
is
different
for
him
how
how
is
paul
he
is
well
thank
you
steinmetz
glanced
down
at
her
she
was
looking
across
the
plains
beyond
the
boundless
pine
forests
that
lay
between
thors
and
the
volga
quite
well
he
went
on
kindly
enough
he
hopes
to
ride
over
and
pay
his
respects
to
the
countess
or
the
next
day
and
the
keen
kind
eyes
saw
what
they
expected
in
the
flickering
light
of
the
lamp
at
this
moment
steinmetz
was
pushed
aside
from
within
and
a
hulking
young
man
staggered
out
into
the
road
propelled
from
behind
with
considerable
vigor
after
him
came
a
shower
of
clothes
and
bedding
pah
exclaimed
steinmetz
spluttering
himmel
what
filth
be
careful
catrina
but
catrina
had
slipped
past
him
in
an
instant
he
had
caught
her
by
the
wrist
come
back
he
cried
you
must
not
go
in
there
she
was
just
over
the
threshold
you
have
some
reason
for
keeping
me
out
she
returned
wriggling
in
his
strong
grasp
i
will
i
will
with
a
twist
she
wrenched
herself
free
and
went
into
the
dimly
lighted
room
almost
immediately
she
gave
a
mocking
laugh
paul
she
said
chapter
xiii
unmasked
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
in
the
hovel
broken
only
by
the
wail
of
the
dying
man
in
the
corner
paul
and
catrina
faced
each
other
she
white
and
suddenly
breathless
he
half
frowning
but
he
did
not
meet
her
eyes
paul
she
said
again
with
a
lingering
touch
on
the
name
the
sound
of
her
voice
a
rough
sort
of
tenderness
in
her
angry
tone
made
steinmetz
smile
in
his
grim
way
as
a
man
may
smile
when
in
pain
paul
what
did
you
do
this
for
why
are
you
here
oh
why
are
you
in
this
wretched
place
because
you
sent
for
me
he
answered
quietly
come
let
us
go
out
i
have
finished
here
that
man
will
die
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
for
him
you
must
not
stay
in
here
she
gave
a
short
laugh
as
she
followed
him
he
had
to
stoop
low
to
pass
through
the
then
he
turned
and
held
out
his
hand
for
fear
she
should
trip
over
the
high
threshold
she
nodded
her
thanks
but
refused
the
proffered
assistance
steinmetz
lingered
behind
to
give
some
last
instructions
leaving
paul
and
catrina
to
walk
on
down
the
narrow
street
alone
the
moon
was
just
rising
a
great
yellow
moon
such
as
only
russia
knows
the
land
of
the
silver
night
how
long
have
you
been
doing
this
asked
catrina
suddenly
she
did
not
look
toward
him
but
straight
in
front
of
her
for
some
years
now
he
replied
simply
he
lingered
he
was
waiting
for
steinmetz
who
always
rose
to
such
emergencies
who
understood
secrets
and
how
to
secure
them
when
they
seemed
already
lost
he
did
not
quite
understand
what
was
to
be
done
with
catrina
how
she
was
to
be
silenced
she
had
found
him
out
with
such
startling
rapidity
that
he
felt
disposed
to
admit
her
right
to
dictate
her
own
terms
on
a
straight
road
this
man
was
fearless
and
quick
but
he
had
no
taste
or
capacity
for
crooked
ways
catrina
walked
on
in
silence
she
was
not
looking
at
the
matter
from
his
point
of
view
at
all
of
course
she
said
at
length
of
course
paul
i
admire
you
for
it
immensely
it
is
just
like
you
to
go
and
do
the
thing
quietly
and
say
nothing
about
it
but
oh
you
must
go
away
from
here
i
i
it
is
too
horrible
to
think
of
your
running
such
risks
rather
let
them
all
die
like
flies
than
that
you
must
do
it
you
must
she
spoke
in
english
hurriedly
with
a
little
break
in
her
voice
which
he
did
not
understand
with
ordinary
precautions
the
risk
is
very
small
he
said
practically
yes
but
do
you
take
ordinary
precautions
are
you
sure
you
are
all
right
now
she
stopped
they
were
quite
alone
in
the
one
silent
street
of
the
stricken
village
she
looked
up
into
his
face
her
hands
were
running
over
the
breast
of
the
tattered
coat
he
wore
it
was
lamentably
obvious
even
to
him
that
she
loved
him
in
her
anxiety
she
either
did
not
know
what
she
was
doing
or
she
did
not
care
whether
he
knew
or
not
she
merely
gave
sway
to
the
maternal
instinct
which
is
in
the
love
of
all
women
she
felt
his
hands
she
reached
up
and
touched
his
face
are
you
sure
are
you
sure
you
have
not
taken
it
she
whispered
he
walked
on
almost
roughly
oh
yes
quite
he
said
i
will
not
allow
you
to
go
into
any
more
houses
in
thors
i
can
not
i
will
not
oh
paul
you
do
know
if
you
do
i
will
tell
them
all
who
you
are
and
and
the
government
will
stop
you
what
would
be
the
good
of
that
said
paul
awkwardly
your
father
cared
for
his
peasants
and
was
content
to
run
risks
for
them
i
suppose
you
care
about
them
too
as
you
go
into
their
houses
yes
but
she
paused
gave
a
strange
little
reckless
laugh
and
was
silent
heaven
forbid
that
we
should
say
that
she
wanted
him
to
know
that
she
loved
him
chivalry
bids
us
believe
that
women
guard
the
secret
of
their
love
inviolate
from
the
world
but
what
was
catrina
to
do
men
are
in
the
habit
of
forgetting
that
plain
women
are
women
at
all
surely
some
of
them
may
be
excused
for
reminding
us
at
times
that
they
also
are
capable
of
loving
that
they
also
desire
to
be
loved
happy
is
the
man
who
loves
and
is
loved
of
a
plain
woman
for
she
will
take
her
own
lack
of
beauty
into
consideration
and
give
him
more
than
most
beautiful
women
have
it
in
their
power
to
give
of
course
catrina
went
on
with
a
sudden
anger
which
surprised
herself
i
can
not
stop
you
from
doing
this
at
osterno
though
i
think
it
is
wicked
but
i
can
prevent
you
from
doing
it
here
and
i
certainly
shall
paul
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
you
like
he
said
i
thought
you
cared
more
about
the
peasants
i
do
not
care
a
jot
about
the
peasants
she
answered
passionately
as
compared
it
is
you
i
am
thinking
about
not
them
i
think
you
are
selfish
and
cruel
to
your
friends
my
friends
have
never
shown
that
they
are
consumed
with
anxiety
on
my
account
that
is
mere
prevarication
leave
that
to
herr
steinmetz
and
such
men
whose
business
it
is
you
do
do
it
well
your
friends
may
feel
a
lot
that
they
do
not
show
she
spoke
the
words
shortly
and
sharply
surreptitious
good
is
so
rare
that
when
it
is
found
out
it
very
naturally
gets
mixed
up
with
secret
evil
and
the
perpetrator
of
the
hidden
good
deed
feels
guilty
of
a
crime
paul
was
in
this
lamentable
position
which
he
proceeded
to
further
aggravate
by
seeking
to
excuse
himself
i
did
it
after
mature
consideration
i
tried
paying
another
man
but
he
shirked
his
work
and
showed
the
white
feather
so
steinmetz
and
i
concluded
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
do
our
dirty
work
ourselves
which
being
translated
means
that
you
do
it
pardon
me
steinmetz
does
his
share
catrina
lanovitch
was
essentially
a
woman
despite
her
somewhat
masculine
frame
she
settled
karl
steinmetz
account
with
a
sniff
of
contempt
and
that
is
why
you
have
been
so
fond
of
osterno
the
last
two
years
she
asked
innocently
yes
he
answered
falling
into
the
trap
catrina
winced
one
does
not
wince
the
less
because
the
pain
is
expected
the
girl
had
the
slav
instinct
of
which
makes
russians
so
very
different
from
the
nations
of
europe
only
that
she
enquired
paul
glanced
down
at
her
yes
he
answered
quietly
they
walked
on
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
paul
seemed
tacitly
to
have
given
up
the
idea
of
visiting
any
more
of
the
stricken
cottages
they
were
going
toward
the
long
old
house
which
was
called
the
castle
more
by
courtesy
than
by
right
how
long
are
you
going
to
stay
in
osterno
asked
catrina
at
length
about
a
fortnight
i
can
not
stay
longer
i
am
going
to
be
married
catrina
stopped
dead
she
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
the
ground
with
a
sort
of
wonder
in
her
eyes
not
pleasant
to
see
it
was
the
look
of
one
who
having
fallen
from
a
great
height
is
not
quite
sure
whether
it
means
death
or
not
then
she
walked
on
i
congratulate
you
she
said
i
only
hope
she
will
make
you
happy
she
is
beautiful
i
suppose
yes
answered
paul
simply
the
girl
nodded
her
head
what
is
her
name
etta
sydney
bamborough
catrina
had
evidently
never
heard
the
name
before
it
conveyed
nothing
to
her
womanlike
she
went
back
to
her
first
question
what
is
she
like
paul
hesitated
tall
i
suppose
suggested
the
stunted
woman
at
his
side
yes
and
graceful
yes
has
she
pretty
hair
asked
catrina
i
think
so
yes
you
are
not
observant
said
the
girl
in
a
singularly
even
and
emotionless
voice
perhaps
you
never
noticed
not
particularly
answered
paul
the
girl
raised
her
face
there
was
a
painful
smile
twisting
her
lips
the
moonlight
fell
upon
her
the
deep
shadows
beneath
the
eyes
made
her
face
wear
a
grin
some
have
seen
such
a
grin
on
the
face
of
a
drowning
man
a
sight
not
to
be
forgotten
where
does
she
live
asked
catrina
she
was
unaware
of
the
thought
of
murder
that
was
in
her
own
heart
nevertheless
the
desire
indefinite
shapeless
was
there
to
kill
this
woman
who
was
tall
and
beautiful
whom
paul
alexis
loved
it
must
be
remembered
in
extenuation
that
catrina
lanovitch
had
lived
nearly
all
her
life
in
the
province
of
tver
she
was
not
modern
at
all
deprived
of
the
advantages
of
our
enlightened
society
press
without
the
benefit
of
our
decadent
fictional
literature
she
had
lamentably
narrow
views
of
life
she
was
without
that
deep
philosophy
which
teaches
you
mademoiselle
who
read
this
guileless
tale
that
nothing
matters
very
much
that
love
is
but
a
passing
amusement
the
plaything
of
an
hour
that
if
tom
is
faithless
dick
is
equally
amusing
while
harry
taste
in
gloves
and
compliments
is
worthy
of
some
consideration
that
these
things
be
true
that
at
all
events
the
modern
young
lady
thinks
them
true
is
a
matter
of
no
doubt
whatever
has
not
the
modern
lady
novelist
told
us
so
and
is
not
the
modern
lady
novelist
notable
for
her
close
observation
of
human
nature
her
impartial
judgment
of
human
motives
her
sublime
truth
of
delineation
when
she
sits
down
to
describe
the
thing
she
calls
a
man
by
a
close
study
of
the
refined
feminine
literature
of
the
day
the
modern
young
lady
acquires
not
only
the
knowledge
of
some
startling
social
delinquencies
retailed
not
as
if
they
were
quite
the
exception
but
as
if
they
were
quite
the
correct
thing
but
also
she
will
learn
that
she
is
human
she
will
realize
how
utterly
absurd
it
is
to
attempt
to
be
any
thing
else
if
persons
in
books
she
will
reflect
are
not
or
or
even
it
is
useless
for
an
ordinary
person
out
of
a
book
to
attempt
to
be
any
of
these
this
is
the
lesson
of
some
new
writers
and
catrina
lanovitch
had
fortunately
enough
lacked
the
opportunity
of
learning
it
she
only
knew
that
she
loved
paul
and
that
what
she
wanted
was
love
to
go
with
her
all
through
her
life
she
was
not
nor
subtle
nor
given
to
thinking
about
her
own
thoughts
perhaps
she
was
enough
to
be
romantic
if
this
be
so
we
must
bear
with
her
romance
remembering
that
at
all
events
romance
serves
to
elevate
while
realism
tends
undoubtedly
toward
deterioration
catrina
hated
etta
sydney
bamborough
with
a
simple
hatred
because
she
had
gained
the
love
of
paul
alexis
etta
had
taken
away
from
her
the
only
man
whom
catrina
could
ever
love
all
through
her
life
the
girl
was
simple
enough
unsophisticated
enough
never
to
dream
of
compromise
she
never
for
a
moment
entertained
the
cheap
consolatory
thought
that
in
time
she
would
get
over
it
she
would
marry
somebody
else
and
make
that
compromise
which
is
responsible
for
more
misery
in
this
world
than
ever
is
vice
in
her
great
solitude
growing
to
womanhood
as
she
had
in
the
vast
forest
of
tver
she
had
learned
nearly
all
that
she
knew
from
the
best
teacher
nature
and
she
held
the
strange
effete
theory
that
it
is
wicked
for
a
woman
to
marry
a
man
she
does
not
love
or
to
marry
at
all
for
any
reason
except
love
paul
and
a
few
others
held
like
theories
but
nous
avons
changé
tout
cela
where
does
she
live
asked
catrina
in
london
they
walked
on
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
they
were
walking
slowly
and
they
presently
heard
the
footsteps
of
karl
steinmetz
and
the
servant
close
behind
them
i
wonder
said
catrina
half
to
herself
whether
she
loves
you
it
was
a
question
but
not
one
that
a
man
can
answer
paul
said
nothing
but
walked
gravely
on
by
the
side
of
this
woman
who
knew
that
even
if
etta
sydney
bamborough
should
try
she
could
never
love
him
as
she
herself
did
when
karl
steinmetz
joined
them
they
were
silent
i
suppose
he
said
in
english
that
we
may
rely
upon
the
discretion
of
the
fraülein
catrina
yes
answered
the
girl
you
may
so
far
as
osterno
is
concerned
but
i
would
rather
that
you
did
not
visit
our
people
here
it
is
too
dangerous
in
several
ways
ah
murmured
steinmetz
respectfully
acquiescent
he
was
looking
straight
in
front
of
him
with
an
expression
of
countenance
which
was
almost
dense
then
we
must
bow
to
your
decision
he
went
on
turning
toward
the
tall
man
striding
along
at
his
side
yes
said
paul
simply
steinmetz
smiled
grimly
to
himself
it
was
one
of
his
theories
that
women
hold
the
casting
vote
in
all
earthly
matters
and
when
an
illustration
such
as
this
came
to
prove
the
correctness
of
his
deductions
he
only
smiled
he
was
not
by
nature
a
cynic
only
by
the
force
of
circumstances
will
you
come
to
the
castle
asked
the
girl
at
length
and
steinmetz
by
a
gesture
deferred
the
decision
to
paul
i
think
not
thanks
said
the
latter
we
will
take
you
as
far
as
the
gate
catrina
made
no
comment
when
the
tall
was
reached
she
stopped
and
they
all
became
aware
of
the
sound
of
horses
feet
behind
them
what
is
this
asked
catrina
only
the
starosta
bringing
our
horses
replied
steinmetz
he
has
discovered
nothing
catrina
nodded
and
held
out
her
hand
she
said
rather
coldly
your
secret
is
safe
with
me
set
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
reflected
steinmetz
he
said
nothing
however
when
he
shook
hands
they
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
back
the
way
they
had
come
for
half
an
hour
no
one
spoke
then
paul
broke
the
silence
he
only
said
one
word
d
yes
returned
steinmetz
quietly
charity
is
a
dangerous
plaything
chapter
xiv
a
the
palace
of
industry
where
with
a
fine
sense
of
the
fitness
of
the
name
the
parisians
amuse
themselves
was
in
a
blaze
of
electric
light
and
fashion
the
occasion
was
the
concours
hippique
an
fête
where
the
lovers
of
the
friend
of
man
and
such
persons
as
are
fitted
by
an
ungenerous
fate
with
limbs
suitable
to
horsey
clothes
meet
and
bow
in
france
as
in
a
neighboring
land
less
sunny
horsiness
is
the
last
refuge
of
the
diminutive
it
is
your
small
man
who
is
ever
the
horsiest
in
his
outward
appearance
just
as
it
is
your
very
plain
young
person
who
is
keenest
at
the
class
when
a
frenchman
is
horsey
he
never
runs
the
risk
of
being
mistaken
for
a
groom
or
a
jockey
as
do
his
turfy
compeers
in
england
his
costume
is
so
exaggeratedly
suggestive
of
the
stable
and
the
horse
as
to
leave
no
doubt
whatever
that
he
is
an
amateur
of
the
most
pronounced
type
his
collar
is
so
white
and
stiff
and
portentous
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
him
to
tighten
up
his
own
girths
his
breeches
are
so
breechy
about
the
knees
as
to
render
an
ascent
to
the
saddle
a
feat
which
it
is
not
prudent
to
attempt
without
assistance
his
gloves
are
so
large
and
seamy
as
to
make
it
extremely
difficult
to
grasp
the
bridle
and
quite
impossible
to
buckle
a
strap
your
french
horseman
is
in
fact
rather
like
a
knight
of
old
inasmuch
as
his
attendants
are
required
to
set
him
on
his
horse
with
his
face
turned
in
the
right
direction
his
bridle
in
his
left
hand
his
whip
in
his
right
and
it
is
to
be
supposed
his
heart
in
his
mouth
when
he
is
once
up
there
however
the
gallant
son
of
gaul
can
teach
even
some
of
us
my
masters
the
way
to
sit
a
horse
we
have
however
little
to
do
with
such
matters
here
except
in
so
far
as
they
affect
the
persons
connected
with
this
record
the
concours
hippique
be
it
therefore
known
was
at
its
height
great
deeds
of
horsemanship
had
been
successfully
accomplished
the
fair
had
smiled
beneath
pencilled
eyebrows
upon
the
brave
in
uniform
and
breeches
at
the
time
when
we
join
the
fashionable
throng
the
fair
are
smiling
their
brightest
it
is
in
fact
an
interval
for
refreshment
a
crowd
of
men
jostled
each
other
around
a
long
table
where
insolent
waiters
served
tepid
coffee
and
sandwiches
that
had
been
cut
by
the
hand
of
a
knave
in
the
background
a
number
of
ladies
nodded
encouragement
to
their
cavaliers
in
the
intervals
of
scrutinizing
each
other
dresses
many
pencilled
eyebrows
were
raised
in
derision
of
too
little
style
displayed
by
some
innocent
rival
or
brought
down
in
disapproval
of
too
much
of
the
same
vague
quality
displayed
by
one
less
innocent
in
the
midst
of
these
as
in
his
element
moved
the
baron
claude
de
chauxville
smiling
his
courteous
ready
smile
which
his
enemies
called
a
grin
he
took
up
less
room
than
the
majority
of
the
men
around
him
he
succeeded
in
passing
through
narrower
places
and
jostled
fewer
people
in
a
word
he
proved
to
his
own
satisfaction
and
to
the
discomfiture
of
many
a
younger
man
his
proficiency
in
the
gentle
art
of
getting
on
in
the
world
not
far
from
him
stood
a
stout
gentleman
of
middle
age
with
a
heavy
fair
mustache
brushed
upward
on
either
side
this
man
had
an
air
of
distinction
which
was
notable
even
in
this
assembly
for
there
were
many
distinguished
people
present
and
a
frenchman
of
note
plays
his
part
better
than
do
we
dull
islanders
this
man
looked
like
a
general
so
upright
was
he
so
keen
his
glance
so
independent
the
carriage
of
his
head
he
stood
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
looking
gravely
on
at
the
social
festivity
he
bowed
and
raised
his
hat
to
many
but
he
entered
into
conversation
with
none
ce
vassili
he
heard
more
than
once
whispered
un
homme
dangereux
and
he
smiled
all
the
more
pleasantly
now
if
a
very
keen
observer
had
taken
the
trouble
to
ignore
the
throng
and
watch
two
persons
only
that
observer
might
have
discovered
the
fact
that
claude
de
chauxville
was
slowly
and
purposely
making
his
way
toward
the
man
called
vassili
de
chauxville
knew
and
was
known
of
many
he
had
but
recently
arrived
from
london
he
found
himself
called
upon
to
shake
hands
à
with
this
one
and
that
giving
all
and
sundry
his
impressions
of
the
perfidious
albion
with
a
verve
and
neatness
truly
french
he
went
from
one
to
the
other
with
perfect
grace
and
and
each
change
of
position
brought
him
nearer
to
the
man
with
upturned
mustache
upon
whom
his
movements
were
by
no
means
lost
finally
de
chauxville
bumped
against
the
object
of
his
quest
possibly
indeed
the
object
of
his
presence
at
the
concours
hippique
he
turned
with
a
ready
apology
ah
he
exclaimed
the
very
man
i
was
desiring
to
see
the
individual
known
as
ce
vassili
a
term
of
mingled
contempt
and
distrust
bowed
very
low
he
was
a
plain
commoner
while
his
interlocutor
was
a
baron
the
knowledge
of
this
was
subtly
conveyed
in
his
bow
how
can
i
serve
le
baron
he
enquired
in
a
voice
which
was
naturally
loud
and
strong
but
had
been
reduced
by
careful
training
to
a
tone
inaudible
at
the
distance
of
a
few
paces
by
following
me
to
the
café
tantale
in
ten
minutes
answered
de
chauxville
passing
on
to
greet
a
lady
who
was
bowing
to
him
with
the
labored
grace
of
a
parisienne
vassili
merely
bowed
and
stood
upright
again
there
was
something
in
his
attitude
of
quiet
attention
of
unobtrusive
scrutiny
and
retiring
intelligence
vaguely
suggestive
of
the
police
something
which
his
friends
refrained
from
mentioning
to
him
for
this
vassili
was
a
dignified
man
of
like
susceptibilities
with
ourselves
and
justly
proud
of
the
fact
that
he
belonged
to
the
corps
diplomatique
what
position
he
occupied
in
that
select
corporation
he
never
vouchsafed
to
define
but
it
was
known
that
he
enjoyed
considerable
emoluments
while
he
was
never
called
upon
to
represent
his
country
or
his
emperor
in
any
official
capacity
he
was
attached
he
said
to
the
russian
embassy
his
enemies
called
him
a
spy
but
the
world
never
puts
a
charitable
construction
on
that
of
which
it
only
has
a
partial
knowledge
in
ten
minutes
claude
de
chauxville
left
the
concours
hippique
in
the
champs
elysées
he
turned
to
the
left
up
toward
the
bois
du
boulogne
turned
to
the
left
again
and
took
one
of
the
smaller
paths
that
lead
to
one
or
other
of
the
sequestered
and
somewhat
select
cafés
on
the
south
side
of
the
champs
elysées
at
the
café
tantale
not
in
the
garden
for
it
was
winter
but
in
the
inner
room
he
found
the
man
called
vassili
consuming
a
pensive
and
solitary
glass
of
liqueur
de
chauxville
sat
down
stated
his
requirements
to
the
waiter
in
a
single
word
and
offered
his
companion
a
cigarette
which
vassili
accepted
with
the
consciousness
that
it
came
from
a
coroneted
case
i
am
rather
thinking
of
visiting
russia
said
the
frenchman
again
added
vassili
in
his
quiet
voice
de
chauxville
looked
up
sharply
smiled
and
waved
the
word
away
with
a
gesture
of
the
fingers
that
held
a
cigarette
if
you
will
again
on
private
affairs
enquired
vassili
not
so
much
it
would
appear
from
curiosity
as
from
habit
he
put
the
question
with
the
assurance
of
one
who
has
a
right
to
know
de
chauxville
nodded
acquiescence
through
the
tobacco
smoke
the
bane
of
public
men
private
affairs
he
said
epigrammatically
but
the
attaché
to
the
russian
embassy
was
either
too
dense
or
too
clever
to
be
moved
to
a
sympathetic
smile
by
a
cheap
epigram
and
le
baron
wants
a
passport
he
said
lapsing
into
the
useful
third
person
which
makes
the
french
language
so
much
more
fitted
to
social
and
diplomatic
purposes
than
is
our
rough
northern
tongue
and
more
answered
de
chauxville
i
want
what
you
hate
parting
with
information
the
man
called
vassili
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
a
little
smile
it
was
an
odd
little
smile
which
fell
over
his
features
like
a
mask
and
completely
hid
his
thoughts
it
was
apparent
that
claude
de
tricks
of
speech
and
manner
fell
here
on
barren
ground
the
epigrams
his
method
of
conveying
his
meaning
in
a
and
impersonal
generality
failed
to
impress
this
hearer
the
difference
between
a
frenchman
and
a
russian
is
that
the
former
is
amenable
to
every
outward
influence
the
outer
thing
penetrates
the
russian
on
the
contrary
is
a
man
who
works
his
thoughts
as
it
were
from
internal
generation
to
external
action
the
action
moreover
is
demonstrative
which
makes
the
russian
different
from
other
northern
nations
of
an
older
civilization
and
a
completer
then
said
vassili
if
i
understand
le
baron
aright
it
is
a
question
of
private
and
personal
affairs
that
suggests
this
journey
to
russia
precisely
in
no
sense
a
mission
suggested
the
other
sipping
his
liqueur
thoughtfully
in
no
sense
a
mission
i
give
you
a
proof
i
have
been
granted
six
months
leave
of
absence
as
you
probably
know
precisely
so
mo
cher
baron
vassili
had
a
habit
of
applying
to
every
one
the
endearing
epithet
which
lost
a
consonant
somewhere
in
his
mustache
when
a
military
officer
is
granted
a
six
months
leave
it
is
exactly
then
that
we
watch
him
de
chauxville
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
deprecation
possibly
with
contempt
for
any
system
of
watching
may
one
call
it
an
affaire
de
coeur
asked
vassili
with
his
grim
smile
certainly
are
not
all
private
affairs
such
one
way
or
the
other
and
you
want
a
passport
yes
a
special
one
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
thank
you
vassili
emptied
his
glass
drew
in
his
feet
and
glanced
at
the
clock
but
that
is
not
all
i
want
said
de
chauxville
so
i
perceive
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
you
know
of
prince
pavlo
alexis
of
tver
of
tver
what
you
know
from
your
point
of
view
you
understand
my
dear
vassili
nothing
political
nothing
incriminating
nothing
official
i
only
want
a
few
social
details
again
the
odd
smile
fell
over
the
dignified
face
in
case
said
vassili
rather
slowly
i
should
only
impart
to
you
stale
news
and
valueless
details
with
which
you
are
already
acquainted
i
must
ask
you
to
tell
me
first
what
you
know
from
your
point
of
view
certainly
answered
de
chauxville
with
engaging
frankness
the
man
i
know
slightly
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
eton
and
oxford
turn
out
by
the
dozen
well
dressed
athletic
silent
a
thorough
gentleman
et
voilà
tout
the
face
of
vassili
expressed
something
remarkably
like
disbelief
ye
es
he
said
slowly
and
you
suggested
de
chauxville
you
leave
too
much
to
my
imagination
said
vassili
you
relate
mere
facts
have
you
no
suppositions
no
questions
in
your
mind
about
the
man
i
want
to
know
what
his
purpose
in
life
may
be
there
is
a
purpose
one
sees
it
in
his
face
i
want
also
to
know
what
he
does
with
his
spare
time
he
must
have
much
to
dispose
of
in
england
vassili
nodded
and
suddenly
launched
into
detail
prince
pavlo
alexis
he
said
is
a
young
man
who
takes
a
full
and
daring
advantage
of
his
peculiar
position
he
defies
many
laws
in
a
quiet
persistent
way
which
impresses
the
smaller
authorities
and
to
a
certain
extent
paralyzes
them
he
was
in
the
charity
league
deeply
implicated
he
had
a
narrow
escape
he
was
pulled
through
by
the
cleverest
man
in
russia
karl
steinmetz
yes
answered
vassili
behind
the
rigid
smile
karl
steinmetz
and
that
said
de
chauxville
watching
the
face
of
his
companion
is
all
you
can
tell
me
to
be
quite
frank
with
you
replied
the
man
who
had
never
been
quite
frank
in
his
life
that
is
all
i
want
to
tell
you
de
chauxville
lighted
a
cigarette
with
exaggerated
interest
in
the
match
paul
is
a
friend
of
mine
he
said
calmly
i
may
be
staying
at
osterno
with
him
the
rigid
smile
never
relaxed
not
with
karl
steinmetz
on
the
premises
said
vassili
imperturbably
the
astute
steinmetz
may
be
removed
to
some
other
sphere
of
usefulness
there
is
a
new
spoke
in
his
teutonic
wheel
ah
prince
paul
is
about
to
marry
the
widow
of
sydney
bamborough
sydney
bamborough
repeated
vassili
musingly
with
a
perfect
expression
of
innocence
on
his
face
i
have
heard
that
name
before
de
chauxville
laughed
quietly
as
if
in
appreciation
of
a
pretty
trick
which
he
knew
as
well
as
its
performer
she
is
a
friend
of
mine
the
attaché
as
he
was
pleased
to
call
himself
to
the
russian
embassy
leant
his
arms
on
the
table
bending
forward
and
bringing
his
large
fleshy
face
within
a
few
inches
of
de
chauxville
keen
countenance
that
makes
all
the
difference
he
said
i
thought
it
would
answered
de
chauxville
meeting
the
steady
gaze
firmly
chapter
xv
in
a
winter
city
petersburg
under
snow
is
the
most
picturesque
city
in
the
world
the
town
is
at
its
best
when
a
high
wind
has
come
from
the
north
to
blow
all
the
snow
from
the
cupola
of
isaac
leaving
that
golden
dome
in
all
its
brilliancy
to
gleam
and
flash
over
the
whitened
sepulchre
of
a
city
in
winter
the
neva
is
a
broad
silent
thoroughfare
between
the
vassili
ostrow
and
the
admiralty
gardens
in
the
winter
the
pestilential
rattle
of
the
in
the
side
streets
is
at
last
silent
and
the
merry
music
of
takes
its
place
in
the
winter
the
depressing
damp
of
this
northern
venice
is
crystallized
and
harmless
on
the
english
quay
a
tall
narrow
house
stands
looking
glumly
across
the
river
it
is
a
suspected
house
and
watched
for
here
dwelt
stépan
lanovitch
secretary
and
organizer
of
the
charity
league
although
the
outward
appearance
of
the
house
is
uninviting
the
interior
is
warm
and
dainty
the
odor
of
delicate
plants
is
in
the
slightly
enervating
atmosphere
of
the
apartments
it
is
a
russian
fancy
to
fill
the
with
delicate
forced
foliage
and
bloom
in
no
country
of
the
world
are
flowers
so
worshipped
is
money
so
freely
spent
in
floral
decoration
there
is
something
in
the
sight
and
more
especially
in
the
scent
of
plants
that
appeals
to
the
complex
siftings
of
three
races
which
constitute
a
modern
russian
we
in
the
modest
which
is
a
national
characteristic
are
in
the
habit
of
thinking
and
sometimes
saying
that
we
have
all
the
good
points
of
the
angle
and
the
saxon
rolled
satisfactorily
into
one
whole
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
mixed
races
are
the
best
and
we
leave
it
to
be
understood
that
ours
is
the
only
satisfactory
combination
most
of
us
ignore
the
fact
that
there
are
others
at
all
and
very
few
indeed
recognize
the
fact
that
the
russian
of
is
essentially
a
modern
outcome
of
a
triple
racial
alliance
of
which
the
best
component
is
the
tartar
the
modern
russian
is
an
interesting
study
because
he
has
the
remnant
of
barbaric
tastes
with
facilities
for
gratifying
the
same
the
best
part
of
him
comes
from
the
east
the
worst
from
paris
the
countess
lanovitch
belonged
to
the
school
existing
in
petersburg
and
moscow
in
the
early
years
of
the
century
the
school
that
did
not
speak
russian
but
only
french
that
chose
to
class
the
peasants
with
the
beasts
of
the
field
that
apparently
expected
the
deluge
to
follow
soon
her
looking
out
on
to
the
neva
was
characteristic
of
herself
camellias
held
the
floral
honors
in
vase
and
pot
the
french
novel
ruled
supreme
on
the
the
room
was
too
hot
the
chairs
were
too
soft
the
moral
atmosphere
too
lax
one
could
tell
that
this
was
the
of
a
lazy
and
probably
ignorant
woman
the
countess
herself
in
nowise
contradicted
this
conclusion
she
was
seated
on
a
very
low
chair
exposing
a
slippered
foot
to
the
flame
of
a
wood
fire
she
held
a
magazine
in
her
hand
and
yawned
as
she
turned
its
pages
she
was
not
so
stout
in
person
as
her
loose
and
somewhat
highly
colored
cheeks
would
imply
her
eyes
were
dull
and
sleepy
the
woman
was
an
incarnate
yawn
she
looked
up
turning
lazily
in
her
chair
to
note
the
darkening
of
the
air
without
the
double
windows
ah
she
said
aloud
to
herself
in
french
when
will
it
be
as
she
spoke
the
words
the
bells
of
a
sleigh
suddenly
stopped
with
a
rattle
beneath
the
window
immediately
the
countess
rose
and
went
to
the
mirror
over
the
she
arranged
without
enthusiasm
her
straggling
hair
and
put
straight
a
lace
cap
which
was
chronically
crooked
she
looked
at
her
reflection
pessimistically
as
well
she
might
it
was
the
puffy
red
face
of
a
woman
given
to
petty
while
she
was
engaged
in
this
discouraging
pastime
the
door
was
opened
and
a
maid
came
in
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
gained
a
trifling
advantage
by
the
simple
method
of
peeping
it
is
steinmetz
mme
la
comtesse
ah
do
i
look
horrible
célestine
i
have
been
asleep
célestine
was
french
and
laughed
with
all
the
charm
of
that
tactful
nation
how
can
mme
la
comtesse
ask
such
a
thing
madame
might
be
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
the
staff
of
angelic
recorders
have
a
separate
set
of
ledgers
for
french
people
with
special
discounts
attaching
to
pleasant
lies
madame
shook
her
head
and
believed
steinmetz
is
even
now
taking
off
his
furs
in
the
hall
said
célestine
retiring
toward
the
door
it
is
well
we
shall
want
tea
steinmetz
came
into
the
room
with
an
exaggerated
bow
and
a
twinkle
in
his
melancholy
eyes
figure
to
yourself
my
dear
steinmetz
said
the
countess
vivaciously
catrina
has
gone
out
on
a
day
like
this
mon
dieu
how
gray
how
melancholy
without
yes
but
here
how
different
replied
steinmetz
in
french
the
countess
cackled
and
pointed
to
a
chair
ah
you
always
flatter
what
news
have
you
bad
character
steinmetz
smiled
pensively
not
so
much
suggesting
the
desire
to
impart
as
the
intention
to
withhold
that
which
the
lady
called
news
i
came
for
yours
countess
you
are
always
amusing
as
well
as
beautiful
he
added
with
his
mouth
well
controlled
beneath
the
heavy
mustache
the
countess
shook
her
head
playfully
which
had
the
effect
of
tilting
her
cap
to
one
side
i
oh
i
have
nothing
to
tell
you
i
am
a
nun
what
can
one
do
what
can
one
hear
in
petersburg
now
in
paris
it
is
different
but
catrina
is
so
firm
have
you
ever
noticed
that
steinmetz
catrina
firmness
i
mean
she
wills
a
thing
and
her
will
is
like
a
rock
the
thing
has
to
be
done
it
does
itself
it
comes
to
pass
some
people
are
so
now
i
my
clear
steinmetz
only
desire
peace
and
quiet
so
i
give
in
i
gave
in
to
poor
stépan
and
now
he
is
exiled
perhaps
if
i
had
been
firm
if
i
had
forbidden
all
this
nonsense
about
charity
it
would
have
been
different
and
stépan
would
have
been
quietly
at
home
instead
of
in
tomsk
is
it
or
tobolsk
i
always
forget
which
well
catrina
says
we
must
live
in
petersburg
this
winter
and
nous
voilà
steinmetz
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
commiserating
smile
he
took
the
countess
troubles
indifferently
as
do
the
rest
of
us
when
our
neighbor
burden
does
not
drag
upon
our
own
shoulders
it
suited
him
that
catrina
should
be
in
petersburg
and
it
is
to
be
feared
that
the
feelings
of
the
countess
lanovitch
had
no
weight
as
against
the
convenience
of
karl
steinmetz
ah
well
he
said
you
must
console
yourself
with
the
thought
that
petersburg
is
the
brighter
for
some
of
us
who
is
this
another
visitor
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
claude
de
chauxville
walked
into
the
room
with
the
easy
grace
which
was
his
mme
la
comtesse
he
said
bowing
over
her
hand
then
he
stood
upright
and
the
two
men
smiled
grimly
at
each
other
steinmetz
had
thought
that
de
chauxville
was
in
london
the
frenchman
counted
on
the
other
duties
to
retain
him
in
osterno
pleasure
said
de
chauxville
shaking
hands
it
is
mine
answered
steinmetz
the
countess
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
a
smile
on
her
foolish
face
ah
she
exclaimed
how
pleasant
it
is
to
meet
old
friends
it
is
like
times
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
again
and
catrina
came
in
in
her
rich
furs
she
looked
almost
pretty
she
shook
hands
eagerly
with
steinmetz
her
deep
eyes
searched
his
face
with
a
singular
breathless
scrutiny
where
are
you
from
she
asked
quickly
london
catrina
broke
in
the
countess
you
do
not
remember
de
chauxville
he
nursed
you
when
you
were
a
child
catrina
turned
and
bowed
to
de
chauxville
i
should
have
remembered
you
he
said
if
we
had
met
accidentally
after
all
childhood
is
but
a
miniature
is
it
not
so
perhaps
answered
catrina
and
when
the
miniature
develops
it
loses
the
delicacy
which
was
its
chief
charm
she
turned
again
to
steinmetz
as
if
desirous
of
continuing
her
conversation
with
him
de
chauxville
you
surely
have
news
broke
in
the
cackling
voice
i
have
begged
steinmetz
in
vain
he
says
he
has
none
but
is
one
to
believe
so
notorious
a
bad
character
madame
it
is
wise
to
believe
only
that
which
is
convenient
but
steinmetz
i
promise
you
is
the
soul
of
honor
what
sort
of
news
do
you
crave
for
political
which
is
dangerous
social
which
is
scandalous
or
court
news
which
is
invariably
false
let
us
have
scandal
then
ah
i
must
refer
you
to
the
soul
of
honor
who
answered
steinmetz
in
that
official
capacity
is
necessarily
deaf
and
in
a
private
capacity
is
naturally
dull
he
was
looking
very
hard
at
de
chauxville
as
if
he
was
attempting
to
make
him
understand
something
which
he
could
not
say
aloud
de
chauxville
from
carelessness
or
natural
perversity
chose
to
ignore
the
persistent
eyes
surely
the
news
is
from
london
he
said
lightly
we
have
nothing
from
paris
he
glanced
at
steinmetz
who
was
frowning
i
can
hardly
tell
you
stale
news
that
comes
from
london
via
paris
can
i
he
continued
steinmetz
was
tapping
impatiently
on
the
floor
with
his
broad
boot
about
whom
about
whom
cried
the
countess
clapping
her
soft
hands
together
well
about
prince
paul
said
de
chauxville
looking
at
steinmetz
with
airy
defiance
steinmetz
moved
a
little
he
placed
himself
in
front
of
catrina
who
had
suddenly
lost
color
she
could
only
see
his
broad
back
the
others
in
the
room
could
not
see
her
at
all
she
was
rather
small
and
steinmetz
hid
her
as
behind
a
screen
ah
he
said
to
the
countess
his
marriage
but
madame
the
countess
assuredly
knows
of
that
how
could
she
put
in
de
chauxville
the
countess
knew
that
prince
paul
was
going
to
be
married
explained
karl
steinmetz
very
slowly
as
if
he
wished
to
give
some
one
time
with
such
a
man
as
he
to
be
is
not
very
far
from
being
then
it
is
an
accomplished
fact
said
the
countess
sharply
yesterday
answered
steinmetz
and
you
were
not
there
exclaimed
countess
lanovitch
with
uplifted
hands
since
i
was
here
answered
steinmetz
the
countess
launched
into
a
disquisition
on
the
heinousness
of
marrying
any
but
a
compatriot
the
tone
of
her
voice
was
sharp
and
the
volume
of
her
words
almost
amounted
to
invective
as
steinmetz
was
obviously
not
listening
the
lady
imparted
her
views
to
the
baron
de
chauxville
steinmetz
waited
for
some
time
then
he
turned
slowly
toward
catrina
without
actually
looking
at
her
it
is
dangerous
he
said
to
stay
in
this
warm
room
with
your
furs
yes
she
answered
rather
faintly
i
will
go
and
take
them
off
steinmetz
held
the
door
open
for
her
but
he
did
not
look
at
her
chapter
xvi
the
thin
end
but
i
confess
i
can
not
understand
why
i
should
not
be
called
the
princess
alexis
there
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
the
title
i
presume
you
have
a
right
to
it
etta
looked
up
from
her
occupation
of
fixing
a
bracelet
with
a
little
glance
of
enquiry
toward
her
husband
they
had
been
married
a
month
the
honeymoon
a
short
one
had
been
passed
in
the
house
of
a
friend
indeed
a
relation
of
etta
own
a
scotch
peer
who
was
not
above
lending
a
in
scotland
on
the
tacit
understanding
that
there
should
be
some
quid
pro
quo
in
the
future
in
answer
paul
merely
smiled
affectionately
tolerant
of
her
bright
sharpness
of
manner
your
bright
woman
in
society
is
apt
to
be
keen
at
home
what
is
called
vivacity
abroad
may
easily
degenerate
into
snappiness
by
the
hearth
i
think
it
is
rather
ridiculous
being
called
plain
added
etta
with
a
pout
they
were
going
to
a
ball
the
first
since
their
marriage
they
had
just
dined
and
paul
had
followed
his
wife
into
the
he
took
a
delight
in
her
beauty
which
was
of
the
description
that
is
at
its
best
in
a
gorgeous
setting
he
stood
looking
at
her
noting
her
grace
her
pretty
studied
movements
there
were
he
reflected
few
women
more
beautiful
none
in
his
own
estimation
fit
to
compare
with
her
she
had
hitherto
been
sweetness
itself
to
him
enlivening
his
lonely
existence
shining
suddenly
upon
his
nature
with
a
brilliancy
that
made
him
feel
dull
and
already
however
he
was
beginning
to
discover
certain
small
differences
not
so
much
of
opinion
as
of
thought
between
etta
and
himself
she
attached
an
importance
to
social
function
to
social
opinion
to
social
duties
which
he
in
no
wise
understood
invitations
were
showered
upon
them
a
man
who
is
a
prince
and
prefers
to
drop
the
title
need
not
seek
popularity
in
london
the
very
respectable
reader
probably
knows
as
well
as
his
humble
servant
the
writer
that
in
london
there
is
always
a
social
circle
just
a
little
lower
than
one
own
which
opens
its
doors
with
noble
disinterested
hospitality
and
is
prepared
to
lick
the
blacking
from
any
famous
foot
these
invitations
etta
accepted
eagerly
some
women
hold
it
little
short
of
a
crime
to
refuse
an
invitation
and
go
through
life
regretting
that
there
is
only
one
evening
to
each
day
to
paul
these
calls
were
nothing
new
his
secretary
had
hitherto
drawn
a
handsome
salary
for
doing
little
more
than
refuse
such
it
was
in
etta
nature
to
be
somewhat
carried
away
by
glitter
a
great
brilliant
illumination
music
flowers
and
diamonds
had
an
effect
upon
her
which
she
enjoyed
in
anticipation
her
eyes
gleamed
brightly
on
reading
the
mere
card
of
invitation
some
dull
and
men
are
only
to
be
roused
by
the
clatter
and
whirl
of
a
and
this
stirs
them
into
brilliancy
changing
them
to
new
men
etta
always
brilliant
always
bright
exceeded
herself
on
her
a
great
social
function
since
their
marriage
she
had
never
been
so
beautiful
her
eyes
had
never
been
so
sparkling
her
color
so
brilliant
as
at
this
moment
when
she
asked
her
husband
to
let
her
use
her
title
hers
was
the
beauty
that
blooms
not
for
one
man
alone
but
for
the
multitude
that
feeds
not
on
the
love
of
one
but
on
the
admiration
of
many
the
murmur
of
the
man
in
the
street
who
turned
and
stared
into
her
carriage
was
more
than
the
devotion
of
her
husband
a
foreign
title
answered
paul
is
nothing
in
england
i
soon
found
that
out
at
eton
and
at
trinity
it
was
impossible
there
i
dropped
it
and
i
have
never
taken
it
up
again
yes
you
old
stupid
and
you
have
never
taken
the
place
you
are
entitled
to
in
consequence
what
place
may
i
button
that
thanks
she
held
out
her
arm
while
he
with
fingers
much
too
large
for
such
dainty
work
buttoned
her
glove
the
place
in
society
she
answered
oh
does
that
matter
i
never
thought
of
it
of
course
it
matters
answered
the
lady
with
an
astonished
little
laugh
it
is
wonderful
what
an
importance
we
attach
to
that
which
has
been
dearly
won
of
course
it
matters
answered
etta
more
than
well
more
than
any
thing
but
the
position
that
depends
upon
a
foreign
title
can
not
be
of
much
value
said
the
pupil
of
karl
steinmetz
etta
shook
her
pretty
head
reflectively
of
course
she
answered
money
makes
a
position
of
its
own
and
knows
that
you
are
a
prince
but
it
would
be
nicer
with
the
servants
and
to
be
a
princess
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
do
it
said
paul
then
there
is
some
reason
for
it
answered
his
wife
looking
at
him
sharply
yes
there
is
ah
the
reason
is
the
responsibility
that
attaches
to
the
very
title
you
wish
to
wear
the
lady
smiled
a
little
scornfully
perhaps
oh
your
grubby
old
peasants
i
suppose
she
said
yes
you
remember
etta
what
i
told
you
before
we
were
married
about
the
people
i
mean
oh
yes
answered
etta
glancing
at
the
clock
and
hiding
a
little
yawn
behind
her
fan
i
did
not
tell
you
all
went
on
paul
partly
because
it
was
inexpedient
partly
because
i
feared
it
might
bore
you
i
only
told
you
that
i
was
vaguely
interested
in
the
peasants
and
thought
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
they
could
be
gradually
educated
into
a
greater
a
greater
regard
for
cleanliness
and
that
sort
of
thing
yes
dear
i
remember
answered
etta
listlessly
contemplating
her
gloved
hands
well
i
have
not
contented
myself
with
thinking
this
during
the
last
two
or
three
years
i
have
tried
to
put
it
into
practice
steinmetz
and
i
have
lived
at
osterno
six
months
of
the
year
on
purpose
to
organize
matters
on
the
estate
i
was
deeply
implicated
in
the
charity
league
etta
dropped
her
fan
with
a
clatter
into
the
fender
oh
i
hope
it
is
not
broken
she
gasped
with
a
singular
breathlessness
i
do
not
think
so
replied
paul
picking
up
the
fan
and
returning
it
to
her
why
you
look
quite
white
what
does
it
matter
if
it
is
broken
you
have
others
yes
but
etta
paused
opening
the
fan
and
examining
the
sticks
so
closely
that
her
face
was
hidden
by
the
feathers
yes
but
i
like
this
one
what
is
the
charity
league
dear
it
was
a
large
organization
gotten
up
by
the
hereditary
nobles
of
russia
to
educate
the
people
and
better
their
circumstances
by
discriminate
charity
of
course
it
had
to
be
kept
secret
as
the
bureaucracy
is
against
any
attempt
to
civilize
the
people
against
education
or
the
dissemination
of
news
the
thing
was
organized
we
were
just
getting
to
work
when
some
one
stole
the
papers
of
the
league
from
the
house
of
count
stépan
lanovitch
and
sold
them
to
the
government
the
whole
thing
was
broken
up
lanovitch
and
others
were
exiled
i
bolted
home
and
steinmetz
faced
the
storm
alone
in
osterno
he
was
too
clever
for
them
and
nothing
was
brought
home
to
us
but
you
will
understand
that
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
avoid
any
notoriety
to
live
as
quietly
and
privately
as
possible
yes
of
course
but
but
what
you
can
never
go
back
to
russia
said
etta
slowly
feeling
her
ground
as
it
were
oh
yes
i
can
i
was
just
coming
to
that
i
want
to
go
back
this
winter
there
is
so
much
to
be
done
and
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
no
paul
no
no
i
could
do
that
cried
etta
with
a
ring
of
horror
in
her
voice
strangely
out
of
keeping
with
her
peaceful
and
luxurious
surroundings
why
not
asked
the
man
who
had
never
known
fear
oh
i
should
be
afraid
i
could
i
hate
russia
but
you
do
know
it
no
answered
etta
turning
away
and
busying
herself
with
her
long
silken
train
no
of
course
not
only
petersburg
i
mean
but
i
have
heard
what
it
is
so
cold
and
dismal
and
miserable
i
feel
the
cold
so
horribly
i
wanted
to
go
to
the
riviera
this
winter
i
really
think
paul
you
are
asking
me
too
much
i
am
only
asking
a
proof
that
you
care
for
me
etta
gave
a
little
laugh
a
nervous
laugh
with
no
mirth
in
it
a
proof
but
that
is
so
bourgeois
and
unnecessary
have
you
proof
enough
since
i
am
your
wife
paul
looked
at
her
without
any
sign
of
yielding
his
attitude
his
whole
being
was
expressive
of
that
immovability
of
purpose
which
had
hitherto
been
concealed
from
her
by
his
quiet
manner
steinmetz
knew
of
the
mental
barrier
within
this
soul
against
which
prayer
and
argument
were
alike
unavailing
the
german
had
run
against
it
once
or
twice
in
the
course
of
their
joint
labors
and
had
invariably
given
way
at
once
etta
looked
at
him
the
color
was
coming
back
to
her
face
in
patches
there
was
something
unsteady
in
her
eyes
something
suggesting
that
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
daunted
by
a
man
it
was
not
speech
but
his
silence
that
alarmed
her
she
felt
that
trivial
arguments
small
feminine
reasons
were
without
weight
now
that
you
are
married
she
said
i
do
not
think
you
have
any
right
to
risk
your
life
and
your
position
for
a
fad
i
have
done
it
with
impunity
for
the
last
two
or
three
years
he
answered
with
ordinary
precautions
the
risk
is
small
i
have
begun
the
thing
now
i
must
go
on
with
it
but
the
country
is
not
safe
for
us
for
you
oh
yes
it
is
answered
paul
as
safe
as
ever
it
has
been
etta
paused
she
turned
round
and
looked
into
the
fire
he
could
not
see
her
face
then
the
ch
charity
league
is
forgotten
she
said
no
answered
her
husband
quietly
it
will
not
be
forgotten
until
we
have
found
out
who
sold
us
to
the
government
etta
lips
moved
in
a
singular
way
she
drew
them
in
and
held
them
with
her
teeth
for
a
moment
her
beautiful
face
wore
a
hunted
expression
of
fear
what
will
you
gain
by
that
she
asked
evenly
i
oh
nothing
i
do
not
care
one
way
or
the
other
but
there
are
some
people
who
want
the
man
very
much
etta
drew
in
a
long
deep
breath
i
will
go
to
osterno
with
you
if
you
like
she
said
only
only
i
must
have
maggie
with
me
yes
if
you
like
answered
paul
in
some
surprise
the
clock
struck
ten
and
etta
eyes
recovered
their
brightness
womanlike
she
lived
for
the
present
the
responsibility
of
the
future
is
essentially
a
man
affair
the
present
contained
a
ball
and
it
was
only
in
the
future
that
osterno
and
russia
had
to
be
faced
let
us
also
give
etta
alexis
her
due
she
was
almost
fearless
it
is
permissible
to
the
bravest
to
be
startled
she
was
now
quite
collected
the
even
delicate
color
had
returned
to
her
face
maggie
is
such
a
splendid
companion
she
said
lightly
she
is
so
easy
to
please
i
think
she
would
come
if
you
asked
her
paul
if
you
want
her
i
shall
ask
her
of
course
but
it
may
hinder
us
a
little
i
thought
you
might
be
able
to
help
us
with
the
women
you
know
there
was
a
queer
little
smile
on
etta
face
a
smile
one
might
have
thought
of
contempt
yes
of
course
she
said
it
is
so
nice
to
be
able
to
do
good
with
one
money
paul
looked
at
her
in
his
slow
grave
way
but
he
said
nothing
he
knew
that
his
wife
was
cleverer
and
brighter
than
himself
he
was
simple
enough
to
think
that
this
superiority
of
intellect
might
be
devoted
to
the
good
of
the
peasants
of
osterno
it
is
not
a
bad
place
he
said
a
very
fine
castle
one
of
the
finest
in
europe
before
i
came
away
i
gave
orders
for
your
rooms
to
be
done
up
i
should
like
every
thing
to
be
nice
for
you
i
know
you
would
dear
she
answered
glancing
at
the
clock
the
carriage
was
ordered
for
a
ten
but
i
suppose
she
went
on
that
socially
speaking
we
shall
be
rather
isolated
our
neighbors
are
few
and
far
between
the
nearest
said
paul
quietly
are
the
lanovitches
the
lanovitches
do
you
know
them
of
course
not
answered
etta
sharply
but
i
seem
to
know
the
name
were
there
any
in
st
petersburg
the
same
people
answered
paul
count
stépan
lanovitch
etta
was
looking
at
her
husband
with
her
bright
smile
it
was
a
little
too
bright
perhaps
her
eyes
had
a
gleam
in
them
she
was
conscious
of
being
beautifully
dressed
conscious
of
her
own
matchless
beauty
almost
dauntless
like
a
very
strong
man
armed
well
i
think
i
am
a
model
wife
she
said
to
give
in
meekly
to
your
tyranny
to
go
and
bury
myself
in
the
heart
of
russia
in
the
middle
of
winter
by
the
way
we
must
buy
some
furs
that
will
be
rather
exciting
but
you
must
not
expect
me
to
be
very
intimate
with
your
russian
friends
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
i
like
russians
she
went
toward
him
laying
her
two
hands
gently
on
his
broad
breast
and
looking
up
at
him
not
quite
sure
especially
russian
princes
who
bully
their
wives
you
may
kiss
me
however
but
be
very
careful
now
i
must
go
and
finish
dressing
we
shall
be
late
as
it
is
she
gathered
together
her
fan
and
gloves
for
she
had
petulantly
dragged
off
a
pair
which
did
not
fit
and
you
will
ask
maggie
to
come
with
us
she
said
he
held
open
the
door
for
her
to
pass
out
gravely
polite
even
to
his
wife
this
man
yes
he
answered
but
why
do
you
want
me
to
ask
her
because
i
want
her
to
come
chapter
xvii
charity
in
these
democratic
days
a
very
democratic
theory
has
exploded
not
so
very
long
ago
we
believed
or
made
semblance
of
belief
that
it
is
useless
to
put
a
high
price
upon
a
ticket
with
the
object
of
securing
that
selectness
for
which
the
crave
if
they
want
to
come
lady
champignon
wife
of
alderman
champignon
would
say
they
do
not
mind
paying
the
extra
but
lady
champignon
was
wrong
it
is
not
that
the
man
can
not
or
will
not
pay
two
guineas
for
a
it
is
merely
that
in
his
commercial
way
he
thinks
that
he
will
not
have
his
money
worth
and
therefore
prefers
keeping
his
two
guineas
to
spend
on
something
more
tangible
say
food
the
nouveau
riche
never
quite
purges
his
mind
of
the
instinct
commercial
and
it
therefore
goes
against
the
grain
to
pay
heavily
for
a
form
of
entertainment
which
his
soul
had
not
the
opportunity
of
learning
to
love
in
its
youth
the
aristocrat
on
the
other
hand
has
usually
been
brought
up
to
the
cultivation
of
enjoyment
and
he
therefore
spends
with
perfect
equanimity
more
on
his
pleasure
than
the
bourgeois
mind
can
countenance
the
ball
to
which
paul
and
etta
were
going
was
managed
by
some
titled
ladies
who
knew
their
business
well
the
price
of
the
tickets
was
fabulous
the
lady
patronesses
of
the
great
charity
ball
were
tactful
and
unabashed
they
drew
the
necessary
line
never
more
necessary
than
it
is
with
a
firm
hand
the
success
of
the
ball
was
therefore
a
foregone
conclusion
in
french
fiction
there
is
invariably
a
murmur
of
applause
when
the
heroine
enters
a
room
full
of
people
which
fact
serves
at
all
events
to
show
the
breeding
and
social
status
of
persons
with
whom
french
novelists
are
in
the
habit
of
associating
there
was
therefore
no
applause
when
paul
and
etta
made
their
appearance
but
that
lady
had
nevertheless
the
satisfaction
of
perceiving
glances
not
only
of
admiration
but
of
interest
and
even
of
disapproval
among
her
own
sex
her
dress
she
knew
to
be
perfect
and
when
she
perceived
the
craning
pale
face
of
the
inevitable
peering
between
the
balusters
of
a
gallery
she
thoughtfully
took
up
a
prominent
position
immediately
beneath
that
gallery
and
slowly
turned
round
like
a
beautifully
garnished
joint
before
the
fire
of
cheap
publicity
to
paul
this
ball
was
much
like
others
there
were
a
number
of
the
friends
of
his
youth
tall
men
with
a
tendency
toward
length
and
spareness
who
greeted
him
almost
affectionately
some
of
them
introduced
him
to
their
wives
and
sisters
which
ladies
duly
set
him
down
as
nice
but
dull
a
form
of
faint
praise
which
failed
to
damn
there
were
a
number
of
ladies
to
whom
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
bow
in
acknowledgment
of
past
favors
which
had
missed
their
mark
from
the
gallery
the
female
journalists
poked
out
their
eager
faces
for
they
were
women
still
and
liked
to
look
upon
a
man
when
he
was
strong
and
all
the
while
karl
steinmetz
was
storming
in
his
guttural
english
at
the
door
upbraiding
hired
waiters
for
their
stupidity
in
accepting
two
literal
facts
literally
the
one
fact
was
that
they
were
forbidden
to
admit
any
one
without
a
ticket
the
second
fact
being
that
tickets
were
not
to
be
obtained
at
the
price
of
either
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
great
motives
of
man
love
or
money
steinmetz
was
teutonic
and
imposing
with
the
ribbon
of
a
great
order
on
his
breast
he
mentioned
the
names
of
several
ladies
who
might
have
been
but
were
not
of
the
committee
finally
however
he
mentioned
the
historic
name
of
one
whose
husband
had
braved
more
than
one
russian
emperor
successfully
for
england
yes
me
lord
her
ladyship
here
answered
the
man
steinmetz
wrote
on
a
card
in
memory
of
let
me
in
and
sent
in
the
missive
a
few
minutes
later
a
stout
smiling
lady
came
toward
him
with
outstretched
hand
what
mischief
are
you
about
she
enquired
you
stormy
petrel
this
is
no
place
for
your
machinations
we
are
here
to
enjoy
ourselves
and
found
a
hospital
come
in
however
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
you
used
to
be
a
famous
dancer
well
some
little
time
ago
yes
my
dear
countess
let
us
say
some
little
time
ago
ach
those
were
days
those
were
days
you
do
not
mind
the
liberty
i
have
taken
i
am
glad
you
took
it
but
your
card
gave
me
a
little
tug
at
the
heart
it
brought
back
so
much
and
still
plain
karl
steinmetz
after
all
we
used
to
think
much
of
you
in
the
old
days
who
would
have
thought
that
all
the
honors
would
have
slipped
past
you
steinmetz
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
laugh
ah
what
matter
who
cares
so
long
as
my
old
friends
remember
me
who
would
have
thought
my
dear
madam
that
the
map
of
europe
would
have
been
painted
the
colors
it
is
it
was
a
kaleidoscope
the
clatter
of
many
stools
and
i
fell
down
between
them
all
still
plain
karl
steinmetz
still
very
much
at
your
service
shall
i
send
my
check
for
five
guineas
to
you
yes
do
i
am
secretary
always
businesslike
a
wonderful
man
you
are
still
and
you
my
dear
countess
a
wonderful
lady
always
gay
always
courageous
i
have
heard
and
sympathized
i
have
heard
of
many
blows
and
wounds
that
you
have
received
in
the
battle
we
began
well
some
little
time
ago
ah
do
mention
them
they
hurt
none
the
less
because
we
cover
them
with
a
smile
eh
i
dare
say
you
know
you
have
been
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
yourself
but
you
did
not
come
here
to
chat
with
me
though
your
manner
might
lead
one
to
think
so
i
will
not
keep
you
i
came
to
see
prince
pavlo
answered
steinmetz
i
must
thank
you
for
enabling
me
to
do
so
i
may
not
see
you
again
this
evening
my
best
thanks
my
very
dear
lady
he
bowed
and
with
his
smile
left
her
the
first
face
he
recognized
was
a
pretty
one
miss
maggie
delafield
was
just
turning
away
from
a
partner
who
was
taking
his
congé
when
she
looked
across
the
room
and
saw
steinmetz
he
had
only
met
her
once
barely
exchanging
six
words
with
her
and
her
frank
friendly
bow
was
rather
a
surprise
to
him
she
came
toward
him
holding
out
her
hand
with
an
open
friendliness
which
this
young
lady
was
in
the
habit
of
bestowing
upon
men
and
women
impartially
upon
persons
of
either
sex
who
happened
to
meet
with
her
approval
she
did
not
know
what
made
her
incline
to
like
this
man
neither
did
she
seek
to
know
in
a
quiet
british
way
miss
delafield
was
a
creature
of
impulse
her
likes
and
dislikes
were
a
matter
of
instinct
and
much
as
one
respects
the
doctrine
of
charity
it
is
a
question
whether
an
instinctive
dislike
should
be
quashed
by
an
exaggerated
sense
of
neighborly
duty
steinmetz
she
liked
and
there
was
an
end
to
it
i
was
afraid
you
did
not
recognize
me
she
said
my
life
has
not
so
many
pleasures
that
i
can
afford
to
forget
one
of
them
replied
steinmetz
in
his
somewhat
courtesy
but
an
old
buffer
shall
i
say
hardly
expects
to
be
taken
much
notice
of
by
young
ladies
at
a
ball
it
is
not
ten
minutes
since
paul
assured
me
that
you
were
the
best
dancer
that
vienna
ever
produced
said
the
girl
looking
at
him
with
bright
honest
eyes
karl
steinmetz
looked
down
at
her
for
he
was
a
tall
man
when
paul
alexis
was
not
near
his
quiet
gray
eyes
were
almost
affectionate
there
was
a
sudden
sympathy
between
these
two
and
sudden
sympathies
are
the
best
will
you
give
an
old
man
a
trial
he
asked
they
will
laugh
at
you
she
handed
him
her
programme
let
them
laugh
she
said
he
took
the
next
dance
which
happened
to
be
vacant
on
her
card
almost
immediately
the
music
began
and
they
glided
off
together
maggie
began
with
the
feeling
that
she
was
dancing
with
her
own
father
but
this
wore
off
before
they
had
made
much
progress
through
the
crowd
and
gave
way
to
the
sensation
that
she
had
for
partner
the
best
dancer
she
had
ever
met
stout
and
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
she
said
ah
steinmetz
answered
he
was
steering
with
infinite
skill
in
that
room
full
of
dancers
no
one
touched
maggie
elbow
or
the
swing
of
her
dress
and
she
who
knew
what
such
things
meant
smiled
as
she
noted
it
i
have
been
asked
to
go
and
stay
at
osterno
she
said
shall
i
go
by
whom
by
paul
then
go
said
steinmetz
making
one
of
the
few
mistakes
of
his
life
you
think
so
you
want
me
to
go
ach
you
must
not
put
it
like
that
how
well
you
dance
colossal
but
it
does
not
affect
me
your
going
fraülein
since
you
will
be
there
does
that
make
a
difference
my
dear
young
lady
of
course
it
does
i
wonder
why
so
do
i
answered
maggie
frankly
i
wonder
why
i
have
been
wondering
why
ever
since
paul
asked
me
if
you
had
not
been
going
i
should
have
said
at
once
karl
steinmetz
laughed
quietly
what
do
i
represent
he
asked
safety
she
replied
at
once
she
gave
a
queer
little
laugh
and
went
on
dancing
and
paul
he
said
after
a
little
while
strength
replied
maggie
promptly
he
looked
down
at
her
a
momentary
glance
of
wonder
he
was
like
a
woman
inasmuch
as
he
judged
a
person
by
a
flicker
of
the
eyelids
a
glance
a
silence
in
preference
to
judging
by
the
spoken
word
then
with
us
both
to
take
care
of
you
may
we
hope
that
you
will
brave
the
perils
of
osterno
ah
the
music
is
stopping
if
i
may
assure
my
mother
that
there
are
no
perils
something
took
place
beneath
the
gray
mustache
a
smile
or
a
pursing
up
of
the
lips
in
doubt
ah
i
can
not
go
so
far
as
that
you
may
assure
lady
delafield
that
i
will
protect
you
as
i
would
my
own
daughter
if
well
if
the
good
god
in
heaven
had
not
had
other
uses
for
me
i
should
have
had
a
daughter
of
your
age
ach
the
music
has
stopped
the
music
always
does
stop
miss
delafield
that
is
the
worst
of
it
thank
you
for
dancing
with
an
old
buffer
he
took
her
back
to
her
chaperon
bowed
in
his
way
to
both
ladies
and
left
them
if
i
can
help
it
my
very
dear
young
friend
he
said
to
himself
as
he
crossed
the
room
looking
for
paul
you
will
not
go
to
osterno
he
found
paul
talking
to
two
men
you
here
said
paul
in
surprise
yes
answered
steinmetz
shaking
hands
i
gave
lady
fontain
five
guineas
to
let
me
in
and
now
i
want
a
couple
of
chairs
and
a
quiet
corner
if
the
money
includes
such
come
up
into
the
gallery
replied
paul
a
certain
listlessness
which
had
been
his
a
moment
before
vanished
when
paul
recognized
his
friend
he
led
the
way
up
the
narrow
stairs
in
the
gallery
they
found
a
few
people
couples
seeking
like
themselves
a
rare
solitude
what
news
asked
paul
sitting
down
bad
replied
steinmetz
we
have
had
the
misfortune
to
make
a
dangerous
enemy
claude
de
chauxville
claude
de
chauxville
repeated
paul
yes
he
wanted
to
marry
your
wife
for
her
money
paul
leaned
forward
and
dragged
at
his
great
fair
mustache
he
was
not
a
subtle
man
analyzing
his
own
thoughts
had
he
been
he
might
have
wondered
why
he
was
not
more
jealous
in
respect
to
etta
or
went
on
steinmetz
it
may
have
been
the
other
thing
it
is
a
singular
thing
that
many
men
incapable
of
a
lifelong
love
can
conceive
a
lifelong
hatred
based
on
that
love
claude
de
chauxville
has
hated
me
all
his
life
for
very
good
reasons
no
doubt
you
are
now
included
in
his
antipathy
because
you
married
madame
i
dare
say
replied
paul
carelessly
but
i
am
not
afraid
of
claude
de
chauxville
or
any
other
man
i
am
said
steinmetz
he
is
up
to
some
mischief
i
was
calling
on
the
countess
lanovitch
in
petersburg
when
in
walked
claude
de
chauxville
he
was
constrained
at
the
sight
of
my
stout
person
and
showed
it
which
was
a
mistake
now
what
is
he
doing
in
petersburg
he
has
not
been
there
for
ten
years
at
least
he
has
no
friends
there
he
revived
a
minute
acquaintance
with
the
countess
lanovitch
who
is
a
fool
of
the
very
first
water
before
i
came
away
i
heard
from
catrina
that
he
had
wheedled
an
invitation
to
thors
out
of
the
old
lady
why
my
friend
why
paul
reflected
with
a
frown
we
do
not
want
him
out
there
he
said
no
and
if
he
goes
there
you
must
remain
in
england
this
winter
paul
looked
up
sharply
i
do
not
want
to
do
that
it
is
all
arranged
he
said
etta
was
very
much
against
going
at
first
but
i
persuaded
her
to
do
so
it
would
be
a
mistake
not
to
go
now
looking
at
him
gravely
steinmetz
muttered
i
advise
you
not
to
go
paul
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
am
sorry
he
said
it
is
too
late
now
besides
i
have
invited
miss
delafield
and
she
has
practically
accepted
does
that
matter
asked
steinmetz
quietly
yes
i
do
not
want
her
to
think
that
i
am
a
changeable
sort
of
person
steinmetz
rose
and
standing
with
his
two
hands
on
the
marble
rail
he
looked
down
into
the
room
below
the
music
of
a
waltz
was
just
beginning
and
some
of
the
more
enthusiastic
spirits
had
already
begun
dancing
moving
in
and
out
among
the
uniforms
and
gay
dresses
well
he
said
resignedly
it
is
as
you
will
there
is
a
certain
pleasure
in
outwitting
de
chauxville
he
is
so
d
d
clever
chapter
xviii
in
the
champs
élysées
you
must
accept
steinmetz
repeated
to
paul
there
is
no
help
for
it
we
can
not
afford
to
offend
vassili
of
all
people
in
the
world
they
were
standing
together
in
the
saloon
of
a
suite
of
rooms
assigned
for
the
time
to
paul
and
his
party
in
the
hôtel
bristol
in
paris
steinmetz
who
held
an
open
letter
in
his
hand
looked
out
of
the
window
across
the
quiet
place
vendôme
a
north
wind
was
blowing
with
true
parisian
keenness
driving
before
it
a
fine
snow
which
adhered
bleakly
to
the
northern
face
of
a
column
which
is
chiefly
remarkable
for
the
facility
with
which
it
falls
and
rises
again
steinmetz
looked
at
the
letter
with
a
queer
smile
he
held
it
out
from
him
as
if
he
distrusted
the
very
stationery
so
friendly
he
exclaimed
so
very
friendly
bon
steinmetz
he
calls
me
bon
steinmetz
confound
his
cheek
he
hopes
that
his
dear
prince
will
waive
ceremony
and
bring
his
charming
princess
to
dine
quite
en
famille
at
his
little
pied
à
terre
in
the
champs
élysées
he
guarantees
that
only
his
sister
the
marquise
will
be
present
and
he
hopes
that
bon
steinmetz
will
accompany
you
and
also
the
young
lady
the
cousin
of
the
princess
steinmetz
threw
the
letter
down
on
the
table
left
it
there
for
a
moment
and
then
picking
it
up
he
crossed
the
room
and
threw
it
into
the
fire
which
means
he
explained
that
vassili
knows
we
are
here
and
unless
we
dine
with
him
we
shall
be
subjected
to
annoyance
and
delay
on
the
frontier
by
a
stupid
a
singularly
and
suspiciously
stupid
minor
official
if
we
refuse
vassili
will
conclude
that
we
are
afraid
of
him
therefore
we
must
accept
especially
as
vassili
has
his
weak
points
he
loves
a
lord
vassili
if
you
accept
on
some
of
that
stationery
i
ordered
for
you
with
a
colossal
gold
coronet
that
will
already
be
of
some
effect
a
chain
is
as
strong
as
its
weakest
link
weakest
link
will
be
touched
by
your
gorgeous
if
ce
cher
prince
and
la
charmante
princesse
are
gracious
to
him
vassili
is
already
robbed
of
half
his
danger
paul
laughed
it
was
his
habit
either
to
laugh
or
to
grumble
at
karl
steinmetz
somewhat
subtle
precautions
the
word
danger
invariably
made
him
laugh
with
a
ring
in
his
voice
which
seemed
to
betoken
enjoyment
of
course
he
said
i
leave
these
matters
to
you
let
us
show
vassili
at
all
events
that
we
are
not
afraid
of
him
then
sit
down
and
accept
that
which
vassili
was
pleased
to
call
his
little
in
the
champs
élysées
was
in
fact
a
gorgeous
house
in
the
tawdry
style
of
modern
paris
resplendent
in
gray
iron
railings
and
high
surmounted
by
green
cactus
plants
cunningly
devised
in
cast
iron
the
heavy
front
door
was
thrown
open
by
a
lackey
and
others
bowed
in
the
halls
as
if
by
machinery
two
maids
pounced
upon
the
ladies
with
the
of
their
kind
and
country
and
led
the
way
upstairs
while
the
men
removed
fur
coats
in
the
hall
it
was
all
very
princely
and
gorgeous
and
parisian
vassili
and
his
sister
the
marquise
a
stout
lady
in
ruby
velvet
and
amethysts
who
invariably
caused
maggie
delafield
mouth
to
twitch
whenever
she
opened
her
own
during
the
evening
received
the
guests
in
the
they
were
standing
on
the
white
fur
side
by
side
when
the
doors
were
dramatically
thrown
open
and
the
servant
rolled
the
names
unctuously
over
his
tongue
steinmetz
who
was
behind
saw
everything
he
saw
vassili
masklike
face
contract
with
stupefaction
when
he
set
eyes
on
etta
he
saw
the
russian
give
a
little
gasp
and
mutter
an
exclamation
before
he
collected
himself
sufficiently
to
bow
and
conceal
his
face
but
he
could
not
see
etta
face
for
a
moment
or
two
until
the
formal
greetings
were
over
when
he
did
see
it
he
noted
that
it
was
as
white
as
marble
aha
ce
bon
steinmetz
cried
vassili
with
less
formality
holding
out
his
hand
with
frank
and
boyish
good
humor
aha
ce
cher
vassili
returned
steinmetz
taking
the
hand
it
is
good
of
you
le
prince
and
you
madame
to
honor
us
in
our
small
house
said
the
marquise
in
a
guttural
voice
such
as
one
might
expect
from
within
ruby
velvet
and
amethysts
thereafter
she
subsided
into
silence
and
obscurity
so
far
as
the
evening
was
concerned
and
the
present
historian
is
interested
so
said
vassili
with
a
comprehensive
bow
to
all
his
guests
so
you
are
bound
for
russia
but
i
envy
you
i
envy
you
you
know
russia
mme
la
princesse
etta
met
his
veiled
gaze
calmly
a
little
she
replied
there
was
no
sign
of
recognition
in
his
eyes
now
nor
pallor
on
her
face
a
beautiful
country
but
the
rest
of
europe
does
not
believe
it
and
the
estate
of
the
prince
is
one
of
the
vastest
if
not
the
most
beautiful
it
is
a
sporting
estate
is
it
not
prince
essentially
so
replied
paul
bears
wolves
deer
besides
of
course
black
game
capercailzie
ptarmigan
every
thing
one
could
desire
speaking
as
a
sportsman
suggested
vassili
gravely
speaking
as
a
sportsman
of
course
vassili
paused
and
with
a
little
gesture
of
the
hand
included
steinmetz
in
the
conversation
it
may
have
been
that
he
preferred
to
have
him
talking
than
watching
of
course
like
all
great
russian
landholders
you
have
your
troubles
with
the
people
though
you
are
not
strictly
speaking
within
the
famine
district
not
quite
we
are
not
starving
but
we
are
hungry
said
steinmetz
bluntly
vassili
laughed
and
shook
a
gold
chidingly
ah
my
friend
your
old
pernicious
habit
of
calling
a
spade
a
spade
it
is
unfortunate
that
they
should
hunger
a
little
but
what
will
you
they
must
learn
to
be
provident
to
work
harder
and
drink
less
with
such
people
experience
is
the
only
taskmaster
possible
it
is
useless
talking
to
them
it
is
dangerous
to
pauperize
them
besides
the
accounts
that
one
reads
in
the
newspapers
are
manifestly
absurd
and
exaggerated
you
must
not
mademoiselle
he
said
turning
courteously
to
maggie
you
must
not
believe
all
you
are
told
about
russia
i
do
not
replied
maggie
with
an
honest
smile
which
completely
baffled
vassili
he
had
not
had
much
to
do
with
people
who
smiled
honestly
vrai
he
said
with
grave
emphasis
i
am
not
joking
it
is
a
matter
of
the
strictest
fact
that
fiction
has
for
the
moment
fixed
its
fancy
upon
my
country
just
as
it
has
upon
the
east
end
of
your
london
mon
dieu
what
a
lot
of
harm
fiction
with
a
purpose
can
do
but
we
do
not
take
our
facts
from
fiction
in
england
said
maggie
nor
put
in
steinmetz
with
his
blandest
smile
do
we
allow
fiction
to
affect
our
facts
vassili
glanced
at
steinmetz
sideways
here
is
dinner
he
said
mme
la
princesse
may
i
have
the
honor
the
table
was
gorgeously
decorated
the
wine
was
perfect
the
dishes
parisian
every
thing
was
brilliant
and
etta
spirits
rose
such
little
things
affect
the
spirits
of
such
women
it
requires
a
certain
mental
reserve
from
which
to
extract
cheerfulness
over
a
chop
and
a
pint
of
beer
withal
served
on
a
doubtful
cloth
but
some
of
us
find
it
easy
enough
to
be
witty
and
brilliant
over
good
wine
and
a
perfectly
appointed
table
it
is
exile
it
is
nothing
short
of
exile
protested
vassili
who
led
the
conversation
much
as
i
admire
my
own
country
as
a
country
i
do
not
pretend
to
regret
a
fate
that
keeps
me
resident
in
paris
for
men
it
is
different
but
for
madame
and
for
you
mademoiselle
ach
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
looked
up
to
the
ceiling
in
mute
appeal
to
the
gods
above
it
beauty
brilliancy
wit
they
are
all
lost
in
russia
he
bowed
to
the
princess
who
was
looking
and
to
maggie
who
was
not
what
would
paris
say
if
it
knew
what
it
was
losing
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
to
etta
who
smiled
well
pleased
she
was
not
always
able
to
distinguish
between
impertinence
and
flattery
and
indeed
they
are
so
closely
allied
that
the
distinction
is
subtle
steinmetz
on
the
left
hand
of
the
marquise
addressed
one
or
two
remarks
to
that
lady
who
replied
with
her
mouth
full
he
soon
discovered
that
that
which
was
before
her
interested
her
more
than
any
thing
around
and
during
the
banquet
he
contented
himself
by
uttering
an
exclamation
of
delight
at
a
particular
flavor
which
the
lady
was
kind
enough
to
point
out
to
him
with
an
eloquent
and
emphatic
fork
from
time
to
time
vassili
noted
this
with
some
disgust
he
would
have
preferred
that
karl
steinmetz
were
greedy
or
more
conversational
but
the
host
added
aloud
ladies
are
so
good
perhaps
you
are
interested
in
the
peasants
etta
looked
at
steinmetz
who
gave
an
imperceptible
nod
yes
she
answered
i
am
vassili
followed
her
glance
and
found
steinmetz
eating
with
grave
appreciation
of
the
fare
provided
ah
he
said
in
an
expectant
tone
then
you
will
no
doubt
pass
much
of
your
time
in
endeavoring
to
alleviate
their
troubles
their
troubles
with
all
deference
to
ce
cher
prince
why
with
deference
to
me
asked
paul
looking
up
quietly
with
something
in
his
steady
gaze
that
made
maggie
glance
anxiously
at
steinmetz
well
i
understand
that
you
hold
different
opinions
said
the
russian
not
at
all
answered
paul
i
admit
that
the
peasants
have
themselves
to
blame
just
as
a
dog
has
himself
to
blame
when
he
is
caught
in
a
trap
is
the
case
analogous
let
me
recommend
those
olives
i
have
them
from
barcelona
by
a
courier
quite
answered
paul
and
it
is
the
obvious
duty
of
those
who
know
better
to
teach
the
dog
to
avoid
the
places
where
the
traps
are
set
thanks
the
olives
are
excellent
ah
said
vassili
turning
courteously
to
maggie
i
sometimes
thank
my
star
that
i
am
not
a
landholder
only
a
poor
bureaucrat
it
is
so
difficult
to
comprehend
these
questions
mademoiselle
but
of
all
men
in
or
out
of
russia
it
is
possible
our
dear
prince
knows
best
of
what
he
is
talking
oh
no
disclaimed
paul
with
that
gravity
at
which
some
were
ready
to
laugh
i
only
judge
in
a
small
way
from
a
small
experience
ah
you
are
too
modest
you
know
the
peasants
thoroughly
you
understand
them
you
love
them
so
at
least
i
have
been
told
is
it
not
so
mme
la
princesse
karl
steinmetz
was
frowning
over
an
olive
i
really
do
not
know
said
etta
who
had
glanced
across
the
table
i
assure
you
madame
it
is
so
i
am
always
hearing
good
of
you
prince
from
whom
asked
paul
vassili
shrugged
his
peculiarly
square
shoulders
ah
from
all
and
sundry
i
did
not
know
the
prince
had
so
many
enemies
said
steinmetz
bluntly
whereat
the
marquise
laughed
suddenly
and
apparently
approached
within
bowing
distance
of
apoplexy
in
such
wise
the
conversation
went
on
during
the
dinner
which
was
a
long
one
continually
repeatedly
vassili
approached
the
subject
of
osterno
and
the
daily
life
in
that
sequestered
country
but
those
who
knew
were
silent
and
it
was
obvious
that
etta
and
maggie
were
ignorant
of
the
life
to
which
they
were
going
from
time
to
time
vassili
raised
his
dull
yellow
eyes
to
the
servants
who
were
doing
their
work
perfectly
and
invariably
the
master
glance
fell
to
the
glasses
again
these
the
servants
never
left
in
peace
constantly
replenishing
constantly
watching
with
that
assiduity
which
makes
men
thirsty
against
their
will
by
reason
of
the
repeated
reminder
but
tongues
wagged
no
more
freely
for
the
choice
vintages
poured
upon
them
paul
had
a
grave
strong
head
and
that
against
which
alcohol
may
ply
itself
in
vain
karl
steinmetz
had
taken
his
degree
at
heidelberg
he
was
a
seasoned
vessel
having
passed
that
way
before
etta
was
bright
enough
amusing
light
and
gay
so
long
as
it
was
a
question
of
mere
social
gossip
but
whenever
vassili
spoke
of
the
country
to
which
he
expressed
so
deep
a
devotion
she
seeming
to
take
her
cue
from
her
husband
and
his
agent
fell
to
pleasant
silence
it
was
only
after
dinner
in
the
while
musicians
discoursed
offenbach
and
rossini
from
behind
a
screen
of
fern
and
flower
that
vassili
found
an
opportunity
of
addressing
himself
directly
to
etta
in
part
she
desired
this
opportunity
with
a
breathless
apprehension
behind
her
bright
society
smile
without
her
assistance
he
never
would
have
had
it
it
is
most
kind
of
you
he
said
in
french
which
language
had
been
spoken
all
the
evening
in
courtesy
to
the
marquise
who
was
now
asleep
it
is
most
kind
of
you
to
condescend
to
visit
my
poor
house
princess
believe
me
i
feel
the
honor
deeply
when
you
first
came
into
the
room
you
may
have
observed
it
i
was
quite
taken
aback
i
i
have
read
in
books
of
beauty
capable
of
taking
away
a
man
breath
you
must
excuse
me
i
am
a
man
i
never
met
it
until
this
evening
etta
excused
him
readily
enough
she
could
forgive
plenty
of
of
this
description
had
she
not
been
inordinately
vain
this
woman
like
many
would
have
been
extraordinarily
clever
she
laughed
with
little
sidelong
glances
i
only
hope
that
you
will
honor
paris
on
your
way
home
to
england
went
on
vassili
who
had
a
wonderful
knack
of
judging
men
and
women
especially
shallow
ones
now
when
may
that
be
when
may
we
hope
to
see
you
again
how
long
will
you
be
in
russia
and
ce
vassili
is
the
best
english
scholar
i
know
broke
in
steinmetz
who
had
approached
somewhat
quietly
but
he
will
not
talk
princess
he
is
so
shy
paul
was
approaching
also
it
was
eleven
he
said
and
travellers
who
had
to
make
an
early
start
would
do
well
to
get
home
to
bed
when
the
tall
doors
had
been
closed
behind
the
departing
guests
vassili
walked
slowly
to
the
he
posted
himself
on
the
hearthrug
his
perfectly
shod
feet
well
apart
a
fine
dignified
figure
of
a
man
of
erect
and
military
carriage
a
very
mask
of
a
face
soulless
colorless
emotionless
ever
he
stood
biting
at
his
looking
at
the
door
through
which
etta
alexis
had
just
passed
in
all
the
glory
of
her
beauty
wealth
and
position
the
woman
he
said
slowly
who
sold
me
the
charity
league
papers
and
she
thinks
i
do
not
recognize
her
chapter
xix
on
the
neva
karl
steinmetz
had
apparently
been
transacting
business
on
the
vassili
ostrov
which
the
travelled
reader
doubtless
knows
as
the
northern
bank
of
the
neva
a
part
of
petersburg
an
island
as
the
name
tells
us
where
business
is
transacted
where
steamers
land
their
cargoes
and
riverside
loafers
impede
the
traffic
what
the
business
of
karl
steinmetz
may
have
been
is
not
of
moment
or
interest
moreover
it
was
essentially
the
affair
of
a
man
capable
of
holding
his
own
and
his
tongue
against
the
world
he
was
recrossing
the
river
not
by
the
bridge
which
requires
a
doffed
hat
by
reason
of
its
shrine
but
by
one
of
the
numerous
roads
cut
across
the
ice
from
bank
to
bank
he
duly
reached
the
southern
shore
ascending
to
the
admiralty
gardens
by
a
flight
of
sanded
steps
here
he
lighted
a
cigar
and
tucking
his
hands
deep
into
the
pockets
of
his
fur
coat
he
proceeded
to
walk
slowly
through
the
bare
and
deserted
public
garden
a
girl
had
crossed
the
river
in
front
of
him
at
a
smart
pace
she
now
slackened
her
speed
so
much
as
to
allow
him
to
pass
her
karl
steinmetz
noticed
the
action
he
noticed
most
things
this
dull
german
presently
she
passed
him
again
she
dropped
her
umbrella
and
before
picking
it
up
described
a
circle
with
it
a
manoeuvre
remarkably
like
a
signal
then
she
turned
abruptly
and
looked
into
his
face
displaying
a
pleasing
little
round
physiognomy
with
a
smiling
mouth
and
exaggeratedly
grave
eyes
it
was
a
face
of
all
too
common
a
type
in
these
days
of
cheap
educational
literature
the
face
of
a
womanly
woman
engaged
in
unwomanly
work
then
she
came
back
steinmetz
raised
his
hat
in
his
most
fatherly
way
my
dear
young
lady
he
said
in
russian
if
my
personal
appearance
has
made
so
profound
an
impression
as
my
vanity
prompts
me
to
believe
would
it
not
be
decorous
of
you
to
conceal
your
feelings
beneath
a
maiden
modesty
if
on
the
other
hand
the
signals
you
have
been
making
to
me
are
of
profound
political
importance
let
me
assure
you
that
i
am
no
nihilist
then
said
the
girl
beginning
to
walk
by
his
side
what
are
you
what
you
see
a
stout
man
in
easy
circumstances
happily
placed
in
social
obscurity
which
means
that
i
have
few
enemies
and
fewer
friends
the
girl
looked
as
if
she
would
like
to
laugh
had
such
exercise
been
in
keeping
with
a
professional
etiquette
your
name
is
karl
steinmetz
she
said
gravely
that
is
the
name
by
which
i
am
known
to
a
large
staff
of
creditors
replied
he
if
you
will
go
to
no
passage
kazan
at
the
back
of
the
cathedral
back
room
on
the
left
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
go
straight
into
the
room
you
will
find
a
friend
who
wishes
to
see
you
she
said
as
one
repeating
a
lesson
by
rote
and
who
are
you
my
dear
young
lady
i
i
am
no
one
i
am
only
a
paid
agent
ah
they
walked
on
in
silence
a
few
paces
the
bells
of
isaac
church
suddenly
burst
out
into
a
wild
carillon
as
is
their
way
effectually
preventing
further
conversation
for
a
few
moments
will
you
go
asked
the
girl
when
the
sound
had
broken
off
as
suddenly
as
it
had
commenced
probably
i
am
curious
and
not
nervous
except
of
damp
sheets
my
anonymous
friend
does
not
expect
me
to
stay
all
night
i
presume
did
he
or
is
it
a
she
my
fatal
beauty
did
not
name
an
hour
between
now
and
seven
thank
you
god
be
with
you
said
the
girl
suddenly
wheeling
round
and
walking
away
without
looking
after
her
steinmetz
walked
on
gradually
increasing
his
pace
in
a
few
minutes
he
reached
the
large
house
standing
within
iron
gates
at
the
upper
end
of
the
english
quay
the
house
of
prince
pavlo
howard
alexis
he
found
paul
alone
in
his
study
in
a
few
words
he
explained
the
situation
what
do
you
think
it
means
asked
the
prince
heaven
only
knows
and
you
will
go
of
course
replied
steinmetz
i
love
a
mystery
especially
in
petersburg
it
sounds
so
like
a
romance
written
in
the
kennington
road
by
a
lady
who
has
never
been
nearer
to
russia
than
margate
i
had
better
go
with
you
said
paul
gott
no
exclaimed
steinmetz
i
must
go
alone
i
will
take
parks
to
drive
the
sleigh
if
i
may
though
parks
is
a
steady
man
who
loves
a
a
typical
british
coachman
the
brave
parks
back
in
time
for
dinner
asked
paul
i
hope
so
i
have
had
such
mysterious
appointments
thrust
upon
me
before
it
is
probably
a
friend
who
wants
a
note
until
next
monday
the
cathedral
clock
struck
six
as
karl
steinmetz
turned
out
of
the
nevski
prospekt
into
the
large
square
before
the
sacred
edifice
he
soon
found
the
kazan
passage
a
very
nest
of
toyshops
and
following
the
directions
given
he
mounted
a
narrow
staircase
he
knocked
at
the
door
on
the
left
hand
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
come
in
said
a
voice
which
caused
him
to
start
he
pushed
open
the
door
the
room
was
a
small
one
brilliantly
lighted
by
a
paraffin
lamp
at
the
table
sat
an
old
man
with
broad
benevolent
face
high
forehead
thin
hair
and
that
smile
which
savors
of
the
milk
of
human
kindness
and
in
england
suggests
nonconformity
you
ejaculated
steinmetz
stépan
yes
come
in
and
close
the
door
he
laid
aside
his
pen
extended
his
hand
and
rising
kissed
karl
steinmetz
on
both
cheeks
after
the
manner
of
russians
yes
my
dear
karl
it
seems
that
the
good
god
has
still
a
little
work
for
stépan
lanovitch
to
do
i
got
away
quite
easily
in
the
usual
way
through
a
paid
evasion
agency
i
have
been
forwarded
from
pillar
to
post
like
a
prize
fowl
and
reached
petersburg
last
night
i
have
not
long
to
stay
i
am
going
south
i
may
be
able
to
do
some
good
yet
i
hear
that
paul
is
working
wonders
in
tver
what
about
money
asked
steinmetz
who
was
always
practical
catrina
sent
it
the
dear
child
that
is
one
of
the
conditions
made
by
the
agency
a
hard
one
i
am
to
see
no
relations
my
wife
well
bon
dieu
it
does
not
matter
much
she
is
occupied
in
keeping
herself
warm
no
doubt
but
catrina
that
is
a
different
matter
tell
me
how
is
she
that
is
the
first
thing
i
want
to
know
she
is
well
answered
steinmetz
i
saw
her
yesterday
and
happy
the
man
looked
into
steinmetz
face
with
considerable
keenness
yes
it
was
a
moment
for
mental
reservations
one
wonders
whether
such
are
taken
account
of
in
heaven
and
paul
asked
the
count
stépan
lanovitch
at
once
tell
me
about
him
he
is
married
answered
steinmetz
the
count
lanovitch
was
looking
at
the
lamp
he
continued
to
look
at
it
as
if
interested
in
the
mechanism
of
the
burner
then
he
turned
his
eyes
to
the
face
of
his
companion
i
wonder
my
friend
he
said
slowly
how
much
you
know
nothing
answered
steinmetz
the
count
looked
at
him
enquiringly
heaved
a
sharp
sigh
and
abandoned
the
subject
well
he
said
let
us
get
to
business
i
have
much
to
ask
and
to
tell
you
i
want
you
to
see
catrina
and
to
tell
her
that
i
am
safe
and
well
but
she
must
not
attempt
to
see
me
or
correspond
with
me
for
some
years
yet
of
course
you
heard
no
account
of
my
trial
i
was
convicted
on
the
evidence
of
paid
witnesses
of
inciting
to
rebellion
it
was
easy
enough
of
course
i
shall
live
either
in
the
south
or
in
austria
it
is
better
for
you
to
be
in
ignorance
steinmetz
nodded
his
head
curtly
i
do
not
want
to
know
he
said
will
you
please
ask
catrina
to
send
me
money
through
the
usual
channel
no
more
than
she
has
been
sending
it
will
suffice
for
my
small
wants
perhaps
some
day
we
may
meet
in
switzerland
or
in
america
tell
the
dear
child
that
tell
her
i
pray
the
good
god
to
allow
that
meeting
as
for
russia
her
day
has
not
come
yet
it
will
not
come
in
our
time
my
dear
friend
we
are
only
the
sowers
so
much
for
the
future
now
about
the
past
i
have
not
been
idle
i
know
who
stole
the
papers
of
the
charity
league
and
sold
them
i
know
who
bought
them
and
paid
for
them
steinmetz
closed
the
door
he
came
back
to
the
table
he
was
not
smiling
now
quite
the
contrary
tell
me
he
said
i
want
to
know
that
badly
the
count
lanovitch
looked
up
with
a
peculiar
soft
smile
acquired
in
prison
there
is
no
mistaking
it
oh
i
bear
no
ill
will
he
said
i
do
answered
steinmetz
bluntly
who
stole
the
papers
from
thors
sydney
bamborough
good
god
in
heaven
is
that
true
yes
my
friend
steinmetz
passed
his
broad
hand
over
his
forehead
as
if
dazed
and
who
sold
them
he
asked
his
wife
count
lanovitch
was
looking
at
the
burner
of
the
lamp
there
was
a
peculiar
crushed
look
about
the
man
as
if
he
had
reached
the
end
of
his
life
and
was
lying
like
a
ship
hopelessly
disabled
in
smooth
water
where
nothing
could
affect
him
more
steinmetz
scratched
his
forehead
with
one
finger
reflectively
vassili
bought
them
he
said
i
can
guess
that
you
guess
right
returned
lanovitch
quietly
steinmetz
sat
down
he
looked
round
as
if
wondering
whether
the
room
was
very
hot
then
with
a
large
handkerchief
he
wiped
his
brow
you
have
surprised
me
he
admitted
there
are
complications
i
shall
sit
up
all
night
with
your
news
my
dear
stépan
have
you
details
wonderful
wonderful
of
course
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
how
can
people
doubt
it
eh
yes
said
stépan
lanovitch
quietly
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
and
at
present
he
is
angry
with
russia
yes
i
have
details
sydney
bamborough
came
to
stay
at
thors
of
course
he
knew
all
about
the
charity
league
you
remember
that
it
appears
that
his
wife
was
waiting
for
him
and
the
papers
at
tver
he
took
them
from
my
room
but
he
did
not
get
them
all
had
he
got
them
all
you
would
not
be
sitting
there
my
friend
the
general
scheme
he
got
the
list
of
committee
names
the
local
agents
the
foreign
agents
but
the
complete
list
of
the
league
he
failed
to
find
he
secured
the
list
of
subscribers
but
learned
nothing
from
it
because
the
sums
were
identified
by
a
numeral
only
the
clue
to
the
numbers
being
the
complete
list
which
i
burned
when
i
missed
the
other
papers
steinmetz
nodded
curtly
that
was
wise
he
said
you
are
a
clever
man
stépan
but
too
good
for
this
world
and
its
rascals
go
on
it
would
appear
that
bamborough
rode
to
tver
with
the
papers
which
he
handed
to
his
wife
she
took
them
to
paris
while
he
intended
to
come
back
to
thors
he
had
a
certain
cheap
cunning
and
unbounded
impertinence
but
as
you
know
perhaps
he
disappeared
yes
said
steinmetz
scratching
his
forehead
with
one
finger
yes
he
disappeared
karl
steinmetz
had
one
great
factor
of
success
in
this
world
an
infinite
capacity
for
holding
his
cards
one
more
item
said
the
count
in
his
businesslike
calm
way
vassili
paid
that
woman
seven
thousand
pounds
for
the
papers
and
probably
charged
his
masters
ten
added
steinmetz
and
now
you
must
go
the
count
rose
and
looked
at
his
watch
a
cheap
american
article
with
a
loud
tick
he
held
it
out
with
his
queer
smile
and
steinmetz
smiled
the
two
embraced
again
and
there
was
nothing
funny
in
the
action
it
is
a
singular
thing
that
the
sight
of
two
men
kissing
is
conducive
either
to
laughter
or
to
tears
there
is
no
medium
emotion
my
dear
friend
my
very
dear
friend
said
the
count
god
be
with
you
always
we
may
meet
again
or
we
may
not
steinmetz
walked
down
the
nevski
prospekt
on
the
pavement
no
one
walks
on
the
other
and
the
sleigh
followed
him
he
turned
into
a
large
brilliantly
lighted
café
and
loosened
his
coat
give
me
beer
he
said
to
the
waiter
a
very
large
quantity
of
it
the
man
smiled
obsequiously
as
he
set
the
foaming
mug
before
him
is
it
that
his
excellency
is
cold
he
enquired
no
it
is
answered
steinmetz
quite
the
contrary
he
drank
the
beer
and
holding
out
his
hand
in
the
shadow
of
the
table
he
noticed
that
it
trembled
only
a
little
that
is
better
he
murmured
but
i
must
sit
here
a
while
longer
i
suppose
i
was
upset
that
is
what
they
call
it
upset
i
have
never
been
like
that
before
those
lamps
in
the
prospekt
gott
how
they
jumped
up
and
down
he
pressed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
as
if
to
shut
out
the
brightness
of
the
room
the
glaring
gas
and
brilliant
decorations
the
shining
bottles
and
the
many
tables
which
would
not
keep
still
here
he
said
to
the
man
give
me
more
beer
presently
he
rose
and
getting
rather
clumsily
into
his
sleigh
drove
back
at
the
usual
breakneck
pace
to
the
palace
at
the
upper
end
of
the
english
quay
he
sent
an
ambiguous
message
to
paul
saying
that
he
had
returned
and
was
dressing
for
dinner
this
ceremony
he
went
through
slowly
as
one
dazed
by
a
great
fall
or
a
heavy
fatigue
his
servant
a
quick
silent
man
noticed
the
strangeness
of
his
manner
and
like
a
wise
servant
only
betrayed
the
result
of
his
observation
by
a
readier
service
a
quicker
hand
a
quieter
motion
as
steinmetz
went
to
the
he
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
twenty
minutes
past
seven
he
still
had
ten
minutes
to
spare
before
dinner
he
opened
the
door
etta
was
sitting
by
the
fire
alone
she
glanced
back
over
her
shoulder
in
a
quick
hunted
way
which
had
only
become
apparent
to
steinmetz
since
her
arrival
at
petersburg
she
said
madame
he
answered
he
closed
the
door
carefully
behind
him
chapter
xx
an
offer
of
friendship
etta
did
not
move
when
steinmetz
approached
except
indeed
to
push
one
foot
farther
out
toward
the
warmth
of
the
wood
fire
she
certainly
was
very
neatly
shod
steinmetz
was
one
of
her
few
failures
she
had
never
got
any
nearer
to
the
man
despite
his
gray
hair
and
bulky
person
she
argued
that
he
was
still
a
man
and
therefore
an
easy
victim
to
flattery
open
to
the
influence
of
beauty
i
wonder
why
she
said
looking
into
the
fire
you
hate
me
steinmetz
looked
down
at
her
with
his
grim
smile
the
mise
en
scène
was
perfect
from
the
thoughtful
droop
of
the
head
to
the
innocent
display
of
slipper
i
wonder
why
you
think
that
of
me
he
replied
one
can
not
help
perceiving
that
which
is
obvious
while
that
which
is
purposely
made
obvious
serves
to
conceal
that
which
may
exist
behind
it
replied
the
stout
man
etta
paused
to
reflect
over
this
was
steinmetz
going
to
make
love
to
her
she
was
not
an
inexperienced
girl
and
knew
that
there
was
nothing
impossible
or
even
improbable
in
the
thought
she
wondered
what
karl
steinmetz
must
have
been
like
when
he
was
a
young
man
he
had
a
deft
way
even
now
of
planting
a
double
entendre
when
he
took
the
trouble
how
could
she
know
that
his
manner
was
always
easiest
his
attitude
always
politest
toward
the
women
whom
he
despised
in
his
way
this
man
was
a
philosopher
he
had
a
theory
that
an
exaggerated
politeness
is
an
insult
to
a
woman
intellect
you
think
i
do
not
care
said
the
princess
howard
alexis
you
think
i
do
not
admire
you
replied
steinmetz
imperturbably
she
looked
up
at
him
do
you
not
give
me
every
reason
to
think
so
she
returned
with
a
toss
of
the
head
she
was
one
of
those
women
and
there
are
not
a
few
who
would
quarrel
with
you
if
you
do
not
admire
them
not
intentionally
princess
i
am
as
you
know
a
german
of
no
very
subtle
comprehension
my
position
in
your
household
appears
to
me
to
be
a
little
above
the
servants
although
the
prince
is
kind
enough
to
make
a
friend
of
me
and
his
friends
are
so
good
as
to
do
the
same
i
do
not
complain
far
from
it
i
am
well
paid
i
am
interested
in
my
work
i
am
more
or
less
my
own
master
i
am
very
fond
of
paul
you
are
kind
and
forbearing
i
do
my
best
in
a
clumsy
way
no
doubt
to
spare
you
my
heavy
society
but
of
course
i
do
not
presume
to
form
an
opinion
upon
your
upon
you
but
i
want
you
to
form
an
opinion
she
said
petulantly
then
you
must
know
that
i
could
only
form
one
which
would
be
pleasing
to
you
i
know
nothing
of
the
sort
replied
etta
of
course
i
know
that
all
that
you
say
about
position
and
work
is
mere
irony
paul
thinks
there
is
no
one
in
the
world
like
you
steinmetz
glanced
sharply
down
at
her
he
had
never
considered
the
possibility
that
she
might
love
paul
was
this
after
all
jealousy
he
had
attributed
it
to
vanity
and
i
have
no
doubt
he
is
right
she
went
on
suddenly
she
gave
a
little
laugh
do
you
understand
she
said
i
want
to
be
friends
she
did
not
look
at
him
but
sat
with
pouting
lips
holding
out
her
hand
karl
steinmetz
had
been
up
to
the
elbows
as
it
were
in
the
diplomacy
of
an
unscrupulous
grasping
age
ever
since
his
college
days
he
had
been
behind
the
scenes
in
more
than
one
european
crisis
and
that
which
goes
on
behind
the
scenes
is
not
always
edifying
or
conducive
to
a
squeamishness
of
touch
he
was
not
the
man
to
be
mawkishly
afraid
of
soiling
his
fingers
but
the
small
white
hand
rather
disconcerted
him
he
took
it
however
in
his
great
warm
soft
grasp
held
it
for
a
moment
and
relinquished
it
i
do
want
you
to
address
all
your
conversation
to
maggie
and
to
ignore
me
do
you
think
maggie
so
very
pretty
there
was
a
twist
beneath
the
gray
mustache
as
he
answered
is
that
all
the
friendship
you
desire
does
it
extend
no
farther
than
a
passing
wish
to
be
first
in
petty
rivalries
of
daily
existence
i
am
afraid
my
dear
princess
that
my
friendship
is
a
heavier
matter
a
clumsier
thing
than
that
a
big
thing
not
easily
moved
she
suggested
looking
up
with
her
dauntless
smile
he
shrugged
his
great
shoulders
it
may
be
who
knows
i
hope
it
is
he
answered
the
worst
of
those
big
things
is
that
they
are
sometimes
in
the
way
said
etta
reflectively
without
looking
at
him
and
yet
the
life
that
is
only
a
conglomeration
of
trifles
is
a
poor
life
to
look
back
upon
meaning
mine
she
asked
your
life
has
not
been
trifling
he
said
gravely
she
looked
up
at
him
and
then
for
some
moments
kept
silence
while
she
idly
opened
and
shut
her
fan
there
was
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
karl
steinmetz
a
sort
of
atmosphere
of
sympathy
which
had
the
effect
of
compelling
confidence
even
etta
was
affected
by
it
during
the
silence
recorded
she
was
quelling
a
sudden
desire
to
say
things
to
this
man
which
she
had
never
said
to
any
she
only
succeeded
in
part
do
you
ever
feel
an
unaccountable
sensation
of
dread
she
asked
with
a
weary
little
laugh
a
sort
of
foreboding
with
nothing
definite
to
forebode
unaccountable
no
replied
steinmetz
but
then
i
am
a
german
and
stout
which
may
make
a
difference
i
have
no
nerves
he
looked
into
the
fire
through
his
benevolent
spectacles
is
it
nerves
or
is
it
petersburg
she
asked
abruptly
i
think
it
is
petersburg
i
hate
petersburg
why
petersburg
more
than
moscow
or
nijni
or
tver
she
drew
in
a
long
slow
breath
looking
him
up
and
down
the
while
from
the
corners
of
her
eyes
i
do
not
know
she
replied
collectedly
i
think
it
is
damp
these
houses
are
built
on
reclaimed
land
i
believe
this
was
all
marsh
was
it
not
he
did
not
answer
her
question
and
somehow
she
seemed
to
expect
no
reply
he
stood
blinking
down
into
the
fire
while
she
watched
him
furtively
from
the
corners
of
her
eyes
her
lips
parched
and
open
her
face
quite
white
a
few
moments
before
she
had
protested
that
she
desired
his
friendship
she
knew
now
that
she
could
not
brave
his
enmity
and
the
one
word
tver
had
done
it
all
the
mere
mention
of
a
town
obscure
and
squalid
on
the
upper
waters
of
the
mighty
volga
in
during
those
few
moments
she
suddenly
came
face
to
face
with
her
position
what
had
she
to
offer
this
man
she
looked
him
up
and
down
stout
placid
and
impenetrable
here
was
no
common
adventurer
seeking
place
no
coxcomb
seeking
ladies
favors
no
pauper
to
be
bought
with
gold
she
had
no
means
of
ascertaining
how
much
he
knew
how
much
he
suspected
she
had
to
deal
with
a
man
who
held
the
best
cards
and
would
not
play
them
she
could
never
hope
to
find
out
whether
his
knowledge
and
his
suspicions
were
his
alone
or
had
been
imparted
to
others
in
her
walk
through
life
she
had
jostled
mostly
villains
and
a
villain
is
no
very
dangerous
foe
for
he
fights
on
slippery
ground
except
paul
she
had
never
had
to
do
with
a
man
who
was
quite
honest
upright
and
fearless
and
she
had
fallen
into
the
common
error
of
thinking
that
all
such
are
necessarily
simple
unsuspicious
and
a
little
stupid
she
breathed
hard
living
through
years
of
anxiety
in
a
few
moments
of
time
and
she
could
only
realize
that
she
was
helpless
bound
hand
and
foot
in
this
man
power
it
was
he
who
spoke
first
in
the
smaller
crises
of
life
it
is
usually
the
woman
who
takes
this
privilege
upon
herself
but
the
larger
situations
need
a
man
steadier
grasp
my
dear
lady
he
said
if
you
are
content
to
take
my
friendship
as
it
is
it
is
yours
but
i
warn
you
it
is
no
showy
article
there
will
be
no
compliments
no
pretty
speeches
no
little
gifts
of
flowers
and
such
trumpery
amenities
it
will
all
be
very
solid
and
like
myself
you
think
returned
the
lady
that
i
am
fit
for
nothing
better
than
pretty
speeches
and
compliments
and
floral
offerings
she
broke
off
with
a
forced
little
laugh
and
awaited
his
verdict
with
defiant
eyes
upraised
he
returned
the
gaze
through
his
placid
spectacles
her
beauty
in
its
setting
of
brilliant
dress
and
furniture
soft
lights
flowers
and
a
thousand
feminine
surroundings
failed
to
dazzle
him
i
do
he
said
quietly
and
yet
you
offer
me
your
friendship
he
bowed
in
acquiescence
why
she
asked
for
paul
sake
my
dear
lady
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
turned
away
from
him
of
course
she
said
it
is
quite
easy
to
be
rude
as
it
happens
it
is
precisely
for
paul
sake
that
i
took
the
trouble
of
speaking
to
you
on
this
matter
i
do
not
wish
him
to
be
troubled
with
such
small
domestic
affairs
and
therefore
if
we
are
to
live
under
the
same
roof
i
shall
deem
it
a
favor
if
you
will
at
all
events
conceal
your
disapproval
of
me
he
bowed
gravely
and
kept
silence
etta
sat
with
a
little
patch
of
color
on
either
cheek
looking
into
the
fire
until
the
door
was
opened
and
maggie
came
in
steinmetz
went
toward
her
with
his
grave
smile
while
etta
hid
a
face
which
had
grown
haggard
maggie
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
with
frank
interest
the
relationship
between
these
two
had
rather
puzzled
her
of
late
well
said
steinmetz
and
what
of
st
petersburg
i
am
not
disappointed
replied
maggie
it
is
all
i
expected
and
more
i
am
not
blasée
like
etta
every
thing
interests
me
we
were
discussing
petersburg
when
you
came
in
said
steinmetz
drawing
forward
a
chair
the
princess
does
not
like
it
she
complains
of
nerves
nerves
exclaimed
maggie
turning
to
her
cousin
i
did
not
suspect
you
of
having
them
etta
smiled
a
little
wearily
one
never
knows
she
answered
forcing
herself
to
be
light
what
one
may
come
to
in
old
age
i
saw
a
gray
hair
this
morning
i
am
nearly
you
know
when
glamour
goes
nerves
come
well
i
suppose
they
do
especially
in
russia
perhaps
there
is
a
glamour
about
russia
and
i
mean
to
cultivate
it
rather
than
nerves
there
is
a
glamour
about
every
thing
the
broad
streets
the
neva
the
snow
and
the
cold
especially
the
people
it
is
always
especially
the
people
is
it
not
it
is
the
people
my
dear
young
lady
that
lend
interest
to
the
world
paul
took
me
out
in
a
sleigh
this
morning
went
on
maggie
in
her
cheerful
voice
that
knew
no
harm
i
liked
every
thing
the
policemen
in
their
little
boxes
at
the
street
corners
the
officers
in
their
fur
coats
the
cabmen
there
is
something
so
mysterious
about
them
all
one
can
easily
make
up
stories
about
one
meets
in
petersburg
it
is
so
easy
to
think
that
they
are
not
what
they
seem
paul
etta
even
you
herr
steinmetz
may
not
be
what
you
seem
yes
that
is
so
answered
steinmetz
with
a
laugh
you
may
be
a
nihilist
pursued
maggie
you
may
have
bombs
concealed
up
your
sleeves
you
may
exchange
mysterious
passwords
with
people
in
the
streets
you
may
be
much
less
innocent
than
you
appear
all
that
may
be
so
he
admitted
you
may
have
a
revolver
in
the
pocket
of
your
went
on
maggie
pointing
to
the
voluminous
garment
with
her
fan
his
hand
went
to
the
pocket
in
question
and
produced
exactly
what
she
had
suggested
he
held
out
his
hand
with
a
small
revolver
lying
in
the
palm
of
it
even
that
he
said
may
be
so
maggie
looked
at
it
with
a
sudden
curiosity
her
bright
eyes
grave
loaded
she
asked
yes
then
i
will
not
examine
it
how
curious
i
wonder
how
near
to
the
mark
i
may
have
been
in
other
ways
i
wonder
said
steinmetz
looking
at
etta
and
now
tell
us
something
about
the
princess
what
do
you
suspect
her
of
at
this
moment
paul
came
into
the
room
and
grave
miss
delafield
pursued
steinmetz
turning
to
the
is
telling
us
her
suspicions
about
ourselves
i
am
already
as
good
as
condemned
to
siberia
she
is
now
about
to
sit
in
judgment
on
the
princess
maggie
laughed
herr
steinmetz
has
pleaded
guilty
to
the
worst
accusation
she
said
on
the
other
counts
i
leave
him
to
his
own
conscience
any
thing
but
that
urged
steinmetz
paul
came
forward
and
maggie
rather
obviously
avoided
looking
at
him
tell
us
of
paul
crimes
first
said
etta
rather
hurriedly
she
glanced
at
the
clock
whither
karl
steinmetz
eyes
had
also
travelled
oh
paul
said
maggie
rather
indifferently
indeed
it
seemed
as
if
her
lightness
of
heart
had
suddenly
failed
her
well
perhaps
he
is
deeply
involved
in
schemes
for
the
resurrection
of
the
polish
kingdom
or
something
of
that
sort
that
sounds
tame
put
in
steinmetz
i
think
you
would
construct
a
better
romance
respecting
the
princess
in
books
it
is
always
the
beautiful
princesses
who
are
most
deeply
dyed
in
crime
maggie
opened
her
fan
and
closed
it
again
well
she
said
tapping
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
with
it
i
give
etta
a
mysterious
past
she
is
the
sort
of
person
who
would
laugh
and
dance
at
a
ball
with
the
knowledge
that
there
was
a
mine
beneath
the
floor
i
do
not
think
i
am
said
etta
with
a
shudder
she
rose
rather
hurriedly
and
crossed
the
room
with
a
great
rustle
of
silks
stop
her
she
whispered
as
she
passed
steinmetz
chapter
xxi
a
suspected
house
the
countess
lanovitch
and
catrina
were
sitting
together
in
the
that
overlooked
the
english
quay
and
the
neva
the
double
windows
were
rigorously
closed
while
the
inner
panes
were
covered
with
a
thick
rime
the
sun
was
just
setting
over
the
marshes
that
border
the
upper
waters
of
the
gulf
of
finland
and
lit
up
the
city
with
a
rosy
glow
which
penetrated
to
the
room
where
the
two
women
sat
catrina
was
restless
moving
from
chair
to
chair
from
to
window
with
a
lack
of
repose
which
would
certainly
have
touched
the
nerves
of
a
less
lethargic
person
than
the
countess
my
dear
child
that
lady
was
exclaiming
with
lackadaisical
horror
we
can
not
go
to
thors
yet
the
thought
is
too
horrible
you
never
think
of
my
health
besides
the
gloom
of
the
everlasting
snow
is
too
painful
it
makes
me
think
of
your
poor
mistaken
father
who
is
probably
shovelling
it
in
siberia
here
at
all
events
one
can
avoid
the
window
one
need
not
look
at
it
the
policy
of
shutting
one
eyes
is
a
mistake
said
catrina
she
had
risen
and
was
standing
by
the
window
her
stunted
form
being
framed
as
it
were
in
a
rosy
glow
of
pink
the
countess
heaved
a
little
sigh
and
gazed
idly
at
the
fire
she
did
not
understand
catrina
she
was
afraid
of
her
there
was
something
rugged
and
dogged
which
the
girl
had
inherited
from
her
father
that
slavonic
love
of
pain
for
its
own
sake
which
makes
russian
patriots
and
thinkers
strange
incomprehensible
beings
i
question
it
catrina
said
the
elder
lady
but
perhaps
it
is
a
matter
of
health
stantovitch
told
me
quite
between
ourselves
that
if
i
had
given
way
to
my
grief
at
the
time
of
the
trial
he
would
not
have
held
himself
responsible
for
the
consequences
stantovitch
said
catrina
is
a
humbug
my
dear
child
exclaimed
the
countess
he
attends
all
the
noble
ladies
of
petersburg
precisely
answered
catrina
she
was
woman
enough
to
enter
into
futile
arguments
with
her
mother
and
man
enough
to
despise
herself
for
doing
it
why
do
you
want
to
go
back
to
thors
so
soon
murmured
the
elder
lady
with
a
little
sigh
of
despair
she
knew
she
was
playing
a
losing
game
very
badly
she
was
mentally
shuddering
at
the
recollection
of
former
from
tver
to
thors
because
i
am
sure
father
would
like
us
to
be
there
this
hard
winter
but
your
father
is
in
siberia
put
in
the
countess
which
remark
was
ignored
because
if
we
do
not
go
before
the
snow
begins
to
melt
we
shall
have
to
do
the
journey
in
carriages
over
bad
roads
which
is
sure
to
knock
you
up
because
our
place
is
at
thors
and
no
one
wants
us
here
i
hate
petersburg
it
is
no
use
living
here
unless
one
is
rich
and
beautiful
and
popular
we
are
none
of
those
things
so
we
are
better
at
thors
but
we
have
many
nice
friends
here
dear
you
will
see
this
afternoon
i
expect
quite
a
reception
by
the
way
i
hope
kupfer
has
sent
the
little
cakes
your
father
used
to
be
so
fond
of
them
i
wonder
if
we
could
send
him
a
box
to
siberia
he
would
enjoy
them
poor
man
he
might
give
some
to
the
prison
people
and
thus
obtain
a
little
alleviation
yes
the
comte
de
chauxville
said
he
would
come
on
my
first
and
of
course
paul
and
his
wife
must
return
my
call
they
will
come
i
am
anxious
to
see
her
they
say
she
is
beautiful
and
dresses
well
catrina
broad
white
teeth
gleamed
for
a
moment
in
the
flickering
firelight
as
she
clenched
them
over
her
lower
lip
and
therefore
paul
happiness
in
life
is
assured
she
said
in
a
hard
voice
of
course
what
more
could
he
want
murmured
the
countess
in
blissful
ignorance
of
any
irony
catrina
looked
at
her
mother
with
a
gleam
of
utter
contempt
in
her
eyes
that
is
one
of
the
privileges
of
a
great
love
whether
it
bring
happiness
or
misery
the
contempt
for
all
who
have
never
known
it
while
they
remained
thus
the
sound
of
on
the
quiet
english
quay
made
itself
heard
through
the
double
windows
there
was
a
clang
of
many
tones
and
the
horses
pulled
up
with
a
jerk
the
color
left
catrina
face
quite
suddenly
as
if
wiped
away
leaving
her
ghastly
she
was
going
to
see
paul
and
his
wife
presently
the
door
opened
and
etta
came
into
the
room
with
the
indomitable
assurance
which
characterized
her
movements
and
earned
for
her
a
host
of
feminine
enemies
mme
la
comtesse
she
said
with
her
most
gracious
smile
taking
the
limp
hand
offered
to
her
by
the
countess
lanovitch
catrina
stood
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
hating
her
paul
followed
on
his
wife
heels
scarcely
concealing
his
boredom
he
was
not
a
society
man
catrina
came
forward
and
exchanged
a
formal
bow
with
etta
who
took
in
her
plainness
and
the
faults
of
her
dress
at
one
contemptuous
glance
she
smiled
with
the
perfect
pity
of
a
good
figure
for
no
figure
at
all
paul
was
shaking
hands
with
the
countess
when
he
took
catrina
hand
her
fingers
were
icy
and
twitched
nervously
within
his
grasp
the
countess
was
already
babbling
to
etta
in
french
the
princess
howard
alexis
always
began
by
informing
paul
friends
that
she
knew
no
russian
for
a
moment
paul
and
catrina
were
left
as
it
were
alone
when
the
countess
was
once
fairly
roused
from
her
chronic
lethargy
her
voice
usually
acquired
a
metallic
ring
which
dominated
any
other
conversation
that
might
be
going
on
in
the
room
i
wish
you
happiness
said
catrina
and
no
one
heard
her
but
paul
she
did
not
raise
her
eyes
to
his
but
looked
vaguely
at
his
collar
her
voice
was
short
and
rather
breathless
as
if
she
had
just
emerged
from
deep
water
thank
you
answered
paul
simply
he
turned
and
somewhat
naturally
looked
at
his
wife
catrina
thoughts
followed
his
a
man
is
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
presence
of
the
woman
who
loves
him
she
usually
sees
through
him
a
marked
difference
between
masculine
and
feminine
love
catrina
looked
up
sharply
and
caught
his
eyes
resting
on
etta
he
does
not
love
her
he
does
not
love
her
was
the
thought
that
instantly
leaped
into
her
brain
and
if
she
had
said
it
to
him
he
would
have
contradicted
her
flatly
and
honestly
and
in
vain
yes
the
countess
was
saying
with
lazy
volubility
paul
is
one
of
our
oldest
friends
we
are
neighbors
in
the
country
you
know
he
has
always
been
in
and
out
of
our
house
like
one
of
the
family
my
poor
husband
was
very
fond
of
him
is
your
husband
dead
then
asked
etta
in
a
low
voice
with
a
strange
haste
no
he
is
only
in
siberia
you
have
perhaps
heard
of
his
misfortune
count
stépan
lanovitch
etta
nodded
her
head
with
the
deepest
sympathy
i
feel
for
you
countess
she
said
and
yet
you
are
so
brave
and
mademoiselle
she
said
turning
to
catrina
i
hope
we
shall
see
more
of
each
other
in
tver
catrina
bowed
jerkily
and
made
no
reply
etta
glanced
at
her
sharply
perhaps
she
saw
more
than
catrina
knew
i
suppose
she
said
to
the
countess
with
that
inclusive
manner
which
spreads
the
conversation
out
that
paul
and
mlle
de
lanovitch
were
playmates
the
reply
lay
with
either
of
the
ladies
but
catrina
turned
away
yes
answered
the
countess
but
catrina
is
only
ten
years
younger
than
paul
indeed
with
a
faint
cutting
surprise
indeed
etta
looked
younger
than
catrina
on
a
de
son
coeur
and
if
the
heart
be
worn
it
transmits
its
weariness
to
the
face
where
such
signs
are
ascribed
to
years
so
the
little
stab
was
justified
by
catrina
appearance
while
the
party
assembled
were
thus
exchanging
social
amenities
a
past
master
in
such
commerce
joined
them
in
the
person
of
claude
de
chauxville
he
smiled
his
mechanical
heartless
smile
upon
them
all
but
when
he
bowed
over
etta
hand
his
face
was
grave
he
expressed
no
surprise
at
seeing
paul
and
etta
though
his
manner
betokened
that
emotion
there
was
no
sign
of
this
meeting
having
been
a
prearranged
matter
brought
about
by
himself
through
the
easy
and
innocent
instrumentality
of
the
countess
and
you
are
going
to
tver
no
doubt
he
said
almost
at
once
to
etta
yes
answered
that
lady
with
a
momentary
hunted
look
in
her
eyes
it
is
strange
how
an
obscure
geographical
name
may
force
its
way
into
our
lives
never
to
be
forgotten
queen
mary
of
england
struck
a
note
of
the
human
octave
when
she
protested
that
the
word
calais
was
graven
on
her
heart
it
seemed
to
etta
that
tver
was
written
large
wheresoever
she
turned
for
the
conscience
looks
through
a
glass
and
sees
whatever
may
be
written
thereon
overspreading
every
prospect
the
prince
continued
de
chauxville
turning
to
paul
is
a
great
sportsman
i
am
told
a
mighty
hunter
i
wonder
why
englishmen
always
want
to
kill
something
paul
smiled
without
making
an
immediate
answer
he
was
not
the
man
to
be
led
into
the
danger
of
repartee
by
such
as
de
chauxville
we
have
a
few
bears
left
he
said
you
are
fortunate
protested
de
chauxville
i
shot
one
when
i
was
younger
i
was
immensely
afraid
and
so
was
the
bear
i
have
a
great
desire
to
try
again
etta
glanced
at
paul
who
returned
de
chauxville
bland
gaze
with
all
the
imperturbability
of
a
prince
the
countess
cackling
voice
broke
in
at
this
juncture
as
perhaps
de
chauxville
had
intended
it
to
do
then
why
not
come
and
shoot
ours
she
said
we
have
quite
a
number
of
them
in
the
forests
at
thors
ah
mme
la
comtesse
he
answered
with
outspread
deprecatory
hands
but
that
would
be
taking
too
great
an
advantage
of
your
hospitality
and
your
kindness
he
turned
to
catrina
who
received
him
with
a
frown
the
countess
bridled
and
looked
at
her
daughter
with
obvious
maternal
meaning
as
one
who
was
saying
there
you
bungled
your
prince
but
i
have
procured
you
a
baron
the
abuse
of
hospitality
is
the
last
refuge
of
the
needy
continued
de
chauxville
oracularly
but
my
temptation
is
strong
shall
i
yield
to
it
mademoiselle
catrina
smiled
unwillingly
i
would
rather
leave
it
to
your
own
conscience
she
said
but
i
fail
to
see
the
danger
you
anticipate
then
i
accept
madame
said
de
chauxville
with
the
engaging
frankness
which
ever
had
a
false
ring
in
it
if
the
whole
affair
had
been
prearranged
in
claude
de
chauxville
mind
it
certainly
succeeded
more
fully
than
is
usually
the
case
with
human
schemes
if
on
the
other
hand
this
invitation
was
the
result
of
chance
fortune
had
favored
claude
de
chauxville
beyond
his
deserts
the
little
scene
had
played
itself
out
before
the
eyes
of
paul
who
did
not
want
it
of
etta
who
desired
it
and
of
catrina
who
did
not
exactly
know
what
she
wanted
with
the
precision
of
a
carefully
rehearsed
claude
de
chauxville
had
unscrupulously
made
use
of
feminine
vanity
with
all
the
skill
that
was
his
a
little
glance
toward
etta
as
he
accepted
the
invitation
conveyed
to
her
the
fact
that
she
was
the
object
of
his
clever
little
plot
that
it
was
in
order
to
be
near
her
that
he
had
forced
the
countess
lanovitch
to
invite
him
to
thors
and
etta
with
all
her
shrewdness
was
promptly
hoodwinked
vanity
is
a
handicap
assigned
to
clever
women
by
fate
who
handicaps
us
all
without
appeal
de
chauxville
saw
by
a
little
flicker
of
the
eyelids
that
he
had
not
missed
his
mark
he
had
hit
etta
where
his
knowledge
of
her
told
him
she
was
unusually
vulnerable
he
had
made
one
ally
the
countess
he
looked
upon
with
a
wise
contempt
she
was
easier
game
than
etta
catrina
he
understood
well
enough
her
rugged
simplicity
had
betrayed
her
secret
to
him
before
he
had
been
five
minutes
in
the
room
paul
he
despised
as
a
man
lacking
finesse
and
esprit
a
truly
french
form
of
contempt
for
frenchmen
have
yet
to
learn
that
such
qualities
have
remarkably
little
to
do
with
love
claude
de
chauxville
was
one
of
those
men
alas
too
many
who
owe
their
success
in
life
almost
entirely
to
some
feminine
influence
or
another
whenever
he
came
into
direct
opposition
to
men
it
was
his
instinct
to
retire
from
the
field
behind
paul
back
he
despised
him
before
his
face
he
cringed
then
perhaps
he
said
when
the
princess
was
engaged
in
the
usual
farewells
with
the
countess
and
paul
was
moving
toward
the
door
then
perhaps
prince
we
may
meet
again
before
the
spring
if
the
countess
intends
her
invitation
to
be
taken
seriously
yes
answered
paul
i
often
shoot
at
thors
if
you
do
not
happen
to
come
over
perhaps
i
may
be
allowed
to
call
and
pay
my
respects
or
is
the
distance
too
great
you
can
do
it
in
an
hour
and
a
half
with
a
quick
horse
if
the
snow
is
good
answered
paul
then
i
may
make
it
au
revoir
enquired
de
chauxville
holding
out
a
frank
hand
au
revoir
said
paul
if
you
wish
it
and
he
turned
to
say
to
catrina
as
de
chauxville
had
arrived
later
than
the
other
visitors
it
was
quite
natural
that
he
should
remain
after
they
had
left
and
it
may
be
safely
presumed
that
he
took
good
care
to
pin
the
countess
lanovitch
down
to
her
rash
invitation
why
is
that
man
coming
to
tver
said
paul
rather
gruffly
when
etta
and
he
were
settled
beneath
the
furs
of
the
sleigh
we
do
not
want
him
there
i
expect
replied
etta
rather
petulantly
that
we
shall
be
so
horribly
dull
that
even
de
chauxville
will
be
a
welcome
alleviation
paul
said
nothing
he
gave
a
little
sign
to
the
driver
and
the
horses
leaped
forward
with
a
musical
clash
of
their
silver
bells
chapter

it
is
to
be
feared
that
there
is
a
lamentable
lack
of
local
color
in
the
present
narrative
having
safely
arrived
at

we
have
nothing
to
tell
of
that
romantic

no

at

no

nor

of
tales

the
usual
grain
we
have
hardly
mentioned
the
nevski
prospekt
which
street
by
ancient
right
must
needs
figure
in
all
russian
romance
we
have
instead
been
prating
of
and
mere
interiors
of

which
are
the
same
all
the

over
a

but
a

fan
whether
it

on

wall
of
a
canadian
or
the

of
an
indian
bungalow
an
afghan

is
the

it
is
the

that
treads
the

which
makes
one
to
differ

it

whom
we

have

or
nothing

was
alone
in
the
great
of
the
house
at
the
end
of
the
english
quay
alone
and

some
people
be
it
noted
are
gravest
when
alone
and
they
are
wise
for
the

has
too
much
gravity
for
us
to
go
about
it
with
a
long
face
making
matters
worse
let
each
of
us
be
the
centre
of
his
own
gravity
maggie
delafield
had
perhaps
that
spark
in
the
brain
for
which
we
have
but
an
ugly
word
we
call
it
pluck
and
by
it
we
are
enabled
to
win
a
losing
game
and
harder
still
to
lose
a
losing
game
without
much
noise
or
plaint
whatever
this
girl
joys
or
sorrows
may
have
been
and
pray
you
madam
remember
that
no
man
ever
knows
his
neighbor
heart
she
succeeded
as
well
as
any
in
concealing
both
there
are
some
women
who
tell
one
just
enough
about
themselves
to
prove
that
they
can
understand
and
sympathize
maggie
was
of
these
but
she
told
no
more
she
was
alone
when
paul
came
into
the
room
it
was
a
large
room
with
more
than
one
maggie
was
reading
and
she
did
not
look
round
paul
stopped
warming
himself
by
the
fire
nearest
to
the
door
he
was
the
sort
of
man
to
come
into
a
room
without
any
remark
maggie
looked
up
for
a
moment
glancing
at
the
wood
fire
she
seemed
to
know
for
certain
that
it
was
paul
have
you
been
out
she
asked
yes
calling
he
came
toward
her
standing
beside
her
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
looking
into
the
fire
socially
he
said
with
a
quiet
humor
i
am
not
a
success
her
book
dropped
upon
her
knees
her
two
hands
crossed
upon
its
pages
she
stared
at
the
glowing
logs
as
if
his
thoughts
were
written
there
i
do
not
want
to
give
way
he
went
on
to
a
habit
of
morbid
introspection
but
socially
i
am
a
horrid
failure
there
was
a
little
smile
on
the
girl
face
not
caused
by
his
grave
humor
it
would
appear
that
she
was
smiling
at
something
beyond
that
something
only
visible
to
her
own
mental
vision
perhaps
you
do
not
try
she
suggested
practically
oh
yes
i
do
i
try
in
several
languages
i
have
no
you
see
she
said
gravely
you
are
a
large
man
does
that
make
any
difference
he
asked
simply
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
as
he
towered
by
her
side
looked
at
him
with
a
queer
smile
yes
she
answered
i
think
so
for
some
moments
they
remained
thus
without
speaking
in
a
peaceful
silence
although
the
room
was
very
large
it
was
peaceful
what
is
it
by
the
way
that
brings
peace
to
the
atmosphere
of
a
room
of
a
whole
house
sometimes
it
can
only
be
something
in
the
individuality
of
some
person
in
it
we
talk
glibly
of
the
comfort
of
being
settled
the
peacefulness
the
restfulness
of
it
some
people
it
would
appear
are
always
settled
of
settled
convictions
settled
mind
settled
purpose
paul
howard
alexis
was
perhaps
such
a
person
at
all
events
the
girl
sitting
in
the
low
chair
by
his
side
seemed
to
be
under
some
such
influence
seemed
to
have
escaped
the
unrest
which
is
said
to
live
in
palaces
when
she
spoke
it
was
with
a
quiet
voice
as
one
having
plenty
of
time
and
leisure
where
have
you
been
she
asked
practically
maggie
was
always
practical
to
the
lanovitches
where
we
met
the
baron
de
chauxville
ah
why
ah
because
i
dislike
the
baron
de
chauxville
answered
maggie
in
her
decisive
way
i
am
glad
of
that
because
i
hate
him
said
paul
have
you
any
reason
for
your
dislike
miss
delafield
had
a
reason
but
it
was
not
one
that
she
could
mention
to
paul
so
she
gracefully
skirted
the
question
he
has
the
same
effect
upon
me
as
snails
she
explained
airily
then
as
if
to
salve
her
conscience
she
gave
the
reason
but
disguised
so
that
he
did
not
recognize
it
i
have
seen
more
of
de
chauxville
than
you
have
she
said
gravely
he
is
one
of
those
men
of
whom
women
do
see
more
when
men
are
present
he
loses
confidence
like
a
cur
when
a
thoroughbred
terrier
is
about
he
dislikes
you
i
should
take
care
to
give
de
chauxville
a
wide
berth
if
i
were
you
paul
she
had
risen
after
glancing
at
the
clock
she
turned
down
the
page
of
her
book
and
looking
up
suddenly
met
his
eyes
for
a
moment
only
we
are
not
likely
to
drop
into
a
close
friendship
said
paul
but
he
is
coming
to
thors
twenty
miles
from
osterno
there
was
a
momentary
look
of
anxiety
in
the
girl
eyes
which
she
turned
away
to
hide
i
am
sorry
for
that
she
said
does
herr
steinmetz
know
it
not
yet
maggie
paused
for
a
moment
she
was
tracing
with
the
tip
of
her
finger
a
pattern
stamped
on
the
binding
of
the
book
it
would
seem
that
she
had
something
more
to
say
then
suddenly
she
went
away
without
saying
it
in
the
meantime
claude
de
chauxville
had
gently
led
the
countess
lanovitch
to
invite
him
to
stay
to
dinner
he
accepted
the
invitation
with
becoming
reluctance
and
returned
to
the
hotel
de
berlin
where
he
was
staying
in
order
to
dress
he
was
fully
alive
to
the
expediency
of
striking
while
the
iron
is
hot
more
especially
where
women
are
concerned
moreover
his
knowledge
of
the
countess
led
him
to
fear
that
she
would
soon
tire
of
his
society
this
lady
had
a
lamentable
facility
for
getting
to
the
bottom
of
her
friends
powers
of
entertainment
within
a
few
days
it
was
de
chauxville
intention
to
make
secure
his
invitation
to
thors
and
then
to
absent
himself
from
the
countess
at
dinner
he
made
himself
vastly
agreeable
recounting
many
anecdotes
fresh
from
paris
which
duly
amused
the
countess
lanovitch
and
somewhat
shocked
catrina
who
was
not
advanced
or
inclined
to
advance
after
dinner
the
guest
asked
mlle
catrina
to
play
he
opened
the
grand
piano
in
the
inner
with
such
gallantry
and
effusion
that
the
sanguine
countess
somnolescent
in
her
luxurious
chair
began
rehearsing
different
modes
of
mentioning
her
the
baron
yes
she
muttered
to
herself
and
catrina
is
plain
terribly
plain
thereupon
she
fell
asleep
de
chauxville
had
a
good
memory
and
was
moreover
a
good
and
capable
liar
so
catrina
did
not
find
out
that
he
knew
nothing
whatever
of
music
he
watched
the
plain
face
as
the
music
rose
and
fell
himself
impervious
to
its
transcendent
tones
with
practised
cunning
he
waited
until
catrina
was
almost
intoxicated
with
music
an
intoxication
to
which
all
great
musicians
are
liable
ah
he
said
i
envy
you
your
power
with
music
like
that
one
can
almost
imagine
that
life
is
what
one
would
wish
it
to
be
she
did
not
answer
but
she
wandered
off
into
another
air
a
slumber
song
the
schlummerlied
said
de
chauxville
softly
it
almost
has
the
power
to
send
a
sorrow
to
sleep
this
time
she
answered
him
possibly
because
he
had
not
looked
at
her
such
never
sleep
she
said
do
you
know
that
too
he
asked
not
in
a
tone
that
wanted
reply
she
made
no
answer
i
am
sorry
he
went
on
for
me
it
is
different
i
am
a
man
i
have
man
work
to
do
i
can
occupy
myself
with
ambition
at
all
events
i
have
a
man
privilege
of
nursing
revenge
he
saw
her
eyes
light
up
her
breast
heave
with
a
sudden
sigh
something
like
a
smile
wavered
for
a
moment
beneath
his
waxed
mustache
catrina
fingers
supple
and
strong
struck
in
great
chords
the
air
of
a
gloomy
march
from
the
muse
of
some
monastic
composer
while
she
played
claude
de
chauxville
proceeded
with
his
delicate
touch
to
play
on
the
hidden
chords
of
an
untamed
heart
a
man
privilege
he
repeated
musingly
need
it
be
such
she
asked
for
the
first
time
his
eyes
met
hers
not
necessarily
he
answered
and
her
eyes
dropped
before
his
narrow
gaze
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
content
for
the
moment
with
the
progress
he
had
made
he
glanced
at
the
countess
he
was
too
experienced
a
man
to
be
tricked
the
countess
was
really
asleep
her
cap
was
on
one
side
her
mouth
open
a
woman
who
is
pretending
to
sleep
usually
does
so
in
becoming
attitudes
de
chauxville
did
not
speak
again
for
some
minutes
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
leaning
his
forehead
on
his
hand
while
he
peeped
through
his
slim
fingers
he
could
almost
read
the
girl
thoughts
as
she
put
them
into
music
she
does
not
hate
him
yet
he
was
reflecting
but
she
needs
only
to
see
him
with
etta
a
few
times
and
she
will
come
to
it
the
girl
played
on
throwing
all
the
pain
in
her
passionate
untamed
heart
into
the
music
she
knew
nothing
of
the
world
for
half
of
its
temptations
its
wiles
its
wickednesses
were
closed
to
her
by
the
plain
face
that
god
had
given
her
for
beautiful
women
see
the
worst
side
of
human
nature
they
usually
deal
with
the
worst
of
men
catrina
was
an
easy
tool
in
the
hands
of
such
as
claude
de
chauxville
for
he
had
dealt
with
women
and
that
which
is
evil
in
women
all
his
life
and
the
only
mistakes
he
ever
made
were
those
characteristic
errors
of
omission
attaching
to
a
persistent
ignorance
of
the
innate
good
in
human
nature
it
is
this
same
innate
good
that
upsets
the
calculations
of
most
villains
absorbed
as
she
was
in
her
great
grief
catrina
was
in
no
mood
to
seek
for
motives
to
split
a
moral
straw
she
only
knew
that
this
man
seemed
to
understand
her
as
no
one
had
ever
understood
her
she
was
content
with
the
knowledge
that
he
took
the
trouble
to
express
and
to
show
a
sympathy
of
which
those
around
her
had
not
suspected
her
to
be
in
need
the
moment
had
been
propitious
and
claude
de
chauxville
with
true
gallic
insight
had
seized
it
her
heart
was
sore
and
lonely
almost
breaking
and
she
was
without
the
worldly
wisdom
which
tells
us
that
such
hearts
must
at
all
costs
be
hidden
from
the
world
she
was
without
religious
teaching
quite
without
that
higher
moral
teaching
which
is
independent
of
creed
and
conformity
which
is
only
learnt
at
a
good
mother
knee
catrina
had
not
had
a
good
mother
she
had
had
the
countess
a
woman
heaven
protect
our
children
from
such
mothers
in
the
solitude
of
her
life
catrina
lanovitch
had
conceived
a
great
love
a
passion
such
as
a
few
only
are
capable
of
attaining
be
it
for
weal
or
woe
she
had
seen
this
love
ignored
walked
under
foot
by
its
object
with
a
grave
deliberation
which
took
her
breath
away
when
she
thought
of
it
it
was
all
in
all
to
her
to
him
it
was
nothing
her
philosophy
was
simple
she
could
not
sit
still
and
endure
at
this
time
it
seemed
unbearable
she
must
turn
and
rend
some
one
she
did
not
know
whom
but
some
one
must
suffer
it
was
in
this
that
claude
de
chauxville
proposed
to
assist
her
it
is
preposterous
that
people
should
make
others
suffer
and
go
unpunished
he
said
intent
on
his
noble
purpose
catrina
eyelids
flickered
but
she
made
no
answer
the
soreness
of
her
heart
had
not
taken
the
form
of
a
definite
revenge
as
yet
her
love
for
paul
was
still
love
but
it
was
perilously
near
to
hatred
she
had
not
reached
the
point
of
wishing
definitely
that
he
should
suffer
but
the
sight
of
etta
beautiful
carelessly
possessive
in
respect
to
paul
had
brought
her
within
measurable
distance
of
it
the
arrogance
of
those
who
have
all
that
they
desire
is
insupportable
the
frenchman
went
on
in
his
favorite
epigrammatic
way
catrina
a
second
eve
glanced
at
him
and
her
silence
gave
him
permission
to
go
on
some
men
have
a
different
code
of
honor
for
women
who
are
helpless
catrina
knew
vaguely
that
unless
a
woman
is
beloved
by
the
object
of
her
displeasure
she
can
not
easily
make
him
suffer
she
clenched
her
teeth
over
her
lower
lip
as
she
played
a
new
light
was
dawning
in
her
eyes
the
music
was
a
marvel
but
no
one
in
the
room
heard
it
i
would
be
pitiless
to
all
such
men
said
de
chauxville
they
deserve
no
pity
for
they
have
shown
none
the
man
who
deceives
a
woman
is
worthy
of
he
never
finished
the
sentence
her
deep
passionate
eyes
met
his
her
hands
came
down
with
one
final
crash
on
the
chords
she
rose
and
crossed
the
room
mother
she
said
shall
i

for
tea

the

turning
over

a
winter
scene
between
petersburg
and
the
sea
there
are
several
favorite
islands
more
or
less
assigned
to
the
foreigners
residing
in
the
russian
capital
here
the
english
live
and
in
summer
the
familiar
cries
of
the
may
be
heard
while
in
winter
skating
and
tobogganing
hold
merry
sway
it
was
here
namely
on
the
island
of
christeffsky
that
a
great
ice
fête
was
held
on
the
day
preceding
the
departure
of
the
howard
alexis
household
for
tver
the
fête
was
given
by
one
of
the
foreign
ambassadors
a
gentleman
whose
wife
was
accredited
to
the
first
place
in
petersburg
society
it
was
absolutely
necessary
steinmetz
averred
for
the
whole
howard
alexis
party
to
put
in
an
appearance
the
fête
was
supposed
to
begin
at
four
in
the
afternoon
and
by
five
all
petersburg
all
à
dire
worthy
of
mention
in
that
aristocratic
city
had
arrived
one
may
be
sure
claude
de
chauxville
arrived
early
in
beautiful
furs
with
a
pair
of
skates
under
his
arm
he
was
an
influential
member
of
the
cercle
des
patineurs
in
paris
steinmetz
arrived
soon
after
to
look
on
as
he
told
his
many
friends
he
was
he
averred
too
stout
to
skate
and
too
heavy
for
the
little
iron
sleds
on
the
no
no
he
said
there
is
nothing
left
for
me
but
to
watch
i
shall
watch
de
chauxville
he
added
turning
to
that
graceful
skater
with
a
grim
smile
de
chauxville
nodded
and
laughed
you
have
been
doing
that
any
time
this
twenty
years
mon
ami
he
said
as
he
stood
upright
on
his
skates
and
described
an
easy
little
figure
on
the
outside
edge
backward
and
have
always
found
you
on
slippery
ground
and
never
a
fall
said
de
chauxville
over
his
shoulder
as
he
shot
away
across
the
brilliantly
lighted
pond
it
was
quite
dark
a
young
moon
was
rising
over
the
city
throwing
out
in
dark
relief
against
the
sky
a
hundred
steeples
and
domes
the
long
thin
spire
of
the
fortress
church
the
tomb
of
the
romanoffs
shot
up
into
the
heavens
like
a
dagger
near
at
hand
a
thousand
electric
lights
and
colored
lanterns
cunningly
swung
on
the
branches
of
the
pines
made
a
veritable
fairyland
the
ceaseless
song
of
the
skates
on
ice
as
hard
as
iron
mingled
with
the
strains
of
a
band
playing
in
a
kiosk
with
open
windows
from
the
came
the
swishing
scream
of
the
iron
runners
down
the
terrific
slope
the
russians
are
a
people
of
great
emotions
there
is
a
candor
in
their
recognition
of
the
needs
of
the
senses
which
does
not
obtain
in
our
nature
these
strangely
constituted
people
of
the
north
a
budding
nation
a
nation
which
shall
some
day
overrun
the
world
are
easily
intoxicated
and
there
is
a
deliberation
about
their
methods
of
seeking
this
enjoyment
which
appears
at
times
almost
brutal
there
is
nothing
more
characteristic
than
the
imagine
a
slope
as
steep
as
a
roof
paved
with
solid
blocks
of
ice
which
are
subsequently
frozen
together
by
flooding
with
water
imagine
a
sledge
with
steel
runners
polished
like
a
knife
imagine
a
thousand
lights
on
either
side
of
this
glittering
path
and
you
have
some
idea
of
an
it
is
certainly
the
strongest
form
of
excitement
imaginable
next
perhaps
to
there
is
no
question
of
breathing
once
the
sledge
has
been
started
by
the
attendant
the
sensation
is
somewhat
suggestive
of
a
fall
from
a
balloon
and
yet
one
goes
to
the
top
again
as
surely
as
the
drunkard
will
return
to
his
bottle
is
child
play
to
it
and
yet
grave
men
have
prayed
that
they
might
die
in
pink
steinmetz
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
when
an
arm
was
slipped
within
his
will
you
take
me
down
asked
maggie
delafield
he
turned
and
smiled
at
her
fresh
and
blooming
in
her
furs
no
my
dear
young
lady
but
thank
you
for
suggesting
it
is
it
very
dangerous
very
but
i
think
you
ought
to
try
it
it
is
a
revelation
it
is
an
epoch
in
your
life
when
i
was
a
younger
man
i
used
to
sneak
away
to
an
where
i
was
not
known
and
spend
hours
of
the
keenest
enjoyment
where
is
paul
he
has
just
gone
over
there
with
etta
she
refuses
to
go
yes
answered
maggie
steinmetz
looked
down
at
his
companion
with
his
smile
of
quiet
resignation
you
tell
me
you
are
afraid
of
mice
he
said
i
hate
mice
she
replied
yes
i
suppose
i
am
afraid
of
them
the
princess
is
not
afraid
of
she
is
afraid
of
very
little
the
princess
and
yet
she
will
not
go
on
the
what
strange
creatures
mademoiselle
come
let
us
look
for
paul
he
is
the
only
man
who
may
be
trusted
to
take
you
down
they
found
paul
and
etta
together
in
one
of
the
brilliantly
lighted
kiosks
where
refreshments
were
being
served
all
hot
and
steaming
by
servants
it
was
a
singular
scene
if
a
was
left
for
a
few
moments
on
the
table
by
the
watchful
servitors
the
spoon
froze
to
the
saucer
the
refreshments
bread
and
butter
dainty
sandwiches
of
caviare
of
pâté
de
foie
gras
of
a
thousand
delicatessen
from
berlin
and
petersburg
were
kept
from
freezing
on
dishes
the
whole
scene
was
typical
of
life
in
the
northern
capital
where
wealth
wages
a
successful
fight
against
climate
open
fires
burned
brilliantly
in
iron
tripods
within
the
doorway
of
the
tent
and
at
intervals
in
the
gardens
in
a
large
hall
a
string
band
consoled
those
whose
years
or
lungs
would
not
permit
of
the
more
vigorous
entertainments
steinmetz
made
known
to
paul
maggie
desire
to
risk
her
life
on
the
and
gallantly
proposed
to
take
care
of
the
princess
until
his
return
then
said
etta
gayly
you
must
skate
it
is
much
too
cold
to
stand
about
they
are
going
to
dance
a
cotillon
if
it
is
your
command
princess
i
obey
with
alacrity
etta
spoke
rapidly
looking
round
her
all
the
while
with
the
bright
enjoyment
which
overspreads
the
faces
of
some
women
at
almost
any
form
of
entertainment
provided
there
be
music
brilliant
lights
and
a
crowd
of
people
one
can
not
help
wondering
a
little
what
the
minds
of
such
fair
ladies
must
consist
of
to
be
thrown
off
their
balance
by
such
outward
influences
etta
eyes
gleamed
with
excitement
she
was
beautifully
dressed
in
furs
which
adornment
she
was
tall
and
stately
enough
to
carry
to
full
advantage
she
held
her
graceful
head
with
regal
hauteur
every
inch
a
princess
she
was
enjoying
her
keenest
pleasure
a
social
triumph
no
whisper
escaped
her
no
glance
no
nudge
of
admiring
or
envious
notice
on
steinmetz
arm
she
passed
out
of
the
tent
the
touch
of
her
hand
on
his
sleeve
reminded
him
of
a
thoroughbred
horse
stepping
on
to
turf
so
full
of
life
of
electric
thrill
of
excitement
was
it
but
then
karl
steinmetz
was
a
cynic
no
one
else
could
have
thought
of
comparing
etta
humor
to
that
of
a
horse
in
a
racing
paddock
they
procured
skates
and
glided
off
hand
in
hand
equally
proficient
equally
practised
maybe
on
this
same
lake
for
both
had
learned
to
skate
in
russia
they
talked
only
of
the
present
of
the
brilliancy
of
the
fête
of
the
music
of
the
thousand
lights
etta
was
quite
incapable
of
thinking
or
talking
of
any
other
subject
at
that
moment
steinmetz
distinguished
claude
de
chauxville
easily
enough
and
avoided
him
with
some
success
for
a
short
time
but
de
chauxville
soon
caught
sight
of
them
here
is
de
chauxville
said
etta
with
a
pleased
ring
in
her
voice
leave
me
with
him
i
expect
you
are
tired
i
am
not
tired
but
i
am
obedient
replied
steinmetz
as
the
frenchman
came
up
with
his
fur
cap
in
his
hand
bowing
gracefully
claude
de
chauxville
usually
overdid
things
there
is
something
honest
in
a
clumsy
bow
which
had
no
place
in
his
courtly
obeisance
although
steinmetz
continued
to
skate
in
a
leisurely
way
he
also
held
to
his
original
intention
of
looking
on
he
saw
paul
and
maggie
come
back
to
the
edge
of
the
lake
accompanied
by
an
english
lady
of
some
importance
in
russia
with
whom
maggie
presently
went
away
to
the
steinmetz
glided
up
to
paul
who
was
lighting
a
cigarette
at
the
edge
of
the
pond
where
an
attendant
stood
by
an
open
wood
fire
with
cigarettes
and
hot
beverages
get
a
pair
of
skates
said
the
german
this
ice
is
marvellous
he
amused
himself
with
describing
figures
like
a
huge
boy
until
paul
joined
him
where
is
etta
asked
the
prince
at
once
over
there
with
de
chauxville
paul
said
nothing
for
a
few
moments
they
skated
side
by
side
round
the
lake
it
was
too
cold
to
stand
still
even
for
a
minute
i
told
you
remarked
paul
at
length
that
that
fellow
is
coming
to
thors
i
wish
he
would
go
to
the
devil
said
steinmetz
no
doubt
he
will
in
time
answered
paul
carelessly
yes
but
not
soon
enough
i
assure
you
paul
i
do
not
like
it
we
are
just
in
that
position
that
the
least
breath
of
suspicion
will
get
us
into
endless
trouble
the
authorities
know
that
stépan
lanovitch
has
escaped
at
any
moment
the
charity
league
scandal
may
be
resuscitated
we
do
not
want
fellows
like
de
chauxville
prowling
about
i
know
the
man
he
is
a
d
d
scoundrel
who
would
sell
his
immortal
soul
if
he
could
get
a
bid
for
it
what
is
he
coming
to
thors
for
he
is
not
a
sportsman
why
he
would
be
afraid
of
a
cock
pheasant
though
he
would
be
plucky
enough
among
the
hens
you
do
imagine
he
is
in
love
with
catrina
do
you
no
said
paul
sharply
i
do
steinmetz
raised
his
bushy
eyebrows
etta
and
de
chauxville
skated
past
them
at
that
moment
laughing
gayly
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
went
on
steinmetz
and
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
our
friend
hates
you
personally
he
has
a
grudge
against
you
of
some
sort
of
course
he
hates
me
cela
va
sans
dire
he
has
come
to
russia
to
watch
us
that
i
am
convinced
of
he
has
come
here
bent
on
mischief
it
may
be
that
he
is
hard
up
and
is
to
be
bought
he
is
always
to
be
bought
ce
bon
de
chauxville
at
a
price
we
shall
see
steinmetz
paused
and
glanced
at
paul
he
could
not
tell
him
more
he
could
not
tell
him
that
his
wife
had
sold
the
charity
league
papers
to
those
who
wanted
them
he
could
not
tell
him
all
that
he
knew
of
past
none
of
these
things
could
karl
steinmetz
in
the
philosophy
that
was
his
tell
to
the
person
whom
they
most
concerned
and
who
are
we
that
we
may
hold
him
wrong
the
question
of
telling
and
withholding
is
not
to
be
dismissed
in
a
few
words
but
it
seems
very
certain
that
there
is
too
much
telling
too
much
speaking
out
and
too
little
holding
in
in
these
days
of
much
publicity
there
is
a
school
of
and
would
to
heaven
they
would
learn
to
hold
their
tongues
there
is
a
school
for
calling
a
spade
by
no
other
name
and
they
have
still
to
learn
that
the
world
is
by
no
means
interested
in
their
clatter
of
shovels
the
psalmist
knew
much
of
which
he
did
not
write
and
the
young
men
of
the
modern
school
of
poesy
and
fiction
know
no
more
but
they
lack
the
good
taste
of
the
singer
of
old
that
is
all
karl
steinmetz
was
a
man
who
formed
his
opinion
on
the
best
basis
namely
experience
and
that
had
taught
him
that
a
bold
reticence
does
less
harm
to
one
neighbor
than
a
weak
volubility
paul
was
an
easy
subject
for
such
treatment
his
own
method
inclined
to
err
on
the
side
of
reticence
he
gave
few
confidences
and
asked
none
as
is
the
habit
of
englishmen
well
he
said
i
do
not
suppose
he
will
stay
long
at
thors
and
i
know
that
he
will
not
stay
at
all
at
osterno
besides
what
harm
can
he
actually
do
to
us
he
can
not
well
go
about
making
enquiries
to
begin
with
he
knows
no
russian
i
doubt
that
put
in
steinmetz
and
even
if
he
does
he
can
not
come
poking
about
in
osterno
catrina
will
give
him
no
information
maggie
hates
him
you
and
i
know
him
there
is
only
the
countess
who
will
tell
him
all
she
knows
she
would
render
that
service
to
a
drosky
driver
paul
shrugged
his
shoulders
there
was
no
mention
of
etta
they
stood
side
by
side
both
thinking
of
her
both
looking
at
her
as
she
skated
with
de
chauxville
there
lay
the
danger
and
they
both
knew
it
but
she
was
the
wife
of
one
of
them
and
their
lips
were
necessarily
sealed
and
it
will
be
permitted
claude
de
chauxville
happened
to
be
saying
at
that
moment
that
i
call
and
pay
my
respects
to
an
exiled
princess
there
will
be
difficulties
answered
etta
in
that
tone
which
makes
it
necessary
to
protest
that
difficulties
are
nothing
under
some
circumstances
the
which
de
chauxville
duly
protested
with
much
fervor
you
think
that
twenty
miles
of
snow
would
deter
me
he
said
well
they
might
they
might
if
well
he
left
the
sentence
unfinished
the
last
resource
of
the
sneak
and
the
coward
who
wishes
to
reserve
to
himself
the
letter
of
the
denial

the
spirit
of
the

chapter

home
a
tearing
howling
wind
from
the
north
from
the
boundless
plains
of
russia
that
lie
between
the
neva
and
the
yellow
sea
a
gray
sky
washed
over
as
with
a
huge
brush
dipped
in
dirty
whitening
and
the
plains
of
tver
a
spotless
dazzling
level
of
snow
the
snow
was
falling
softly
and
steadily
falling
as
it
never
falls
in
england
in
little
more
than
fine
powder
with
a
temperature
forty
degrees
below
a
drift
constant
restless
never
altering
sped
over
the
level
plain
like
the
dust
on
a
before
a
steady
wind
this
white
scud
a
flying
scud
of
frozen
water
was
singularly
like
the
scud
that
is
blown
from
the
crest
of
the
waves
by
a
cyclone
in
the
china
seas
any
object
that
broke
the
wind
a
stunted
pine
a
broken
a
government
had
at
its
leeward
side
a
high
narrow
tailing
off
to
the
dead
level
of
the
plain
where
the
wind
dropped
the
snow
rose
at
once
but
these
objects
were
few
and
far
between
the
deadly
monotony
of
the
scene
the
trackless
level
the
preposterous
dimensions
of
the
plain
the
sense
of
distance
that
is
conveyed
only
by
the
steppe
and
the
great
desert
of
gobi
when
the
snow
lies
on
it
all
these
tell
the
same
grim
truth
to
all
who
look
on
them
the
old
truth
that
man
is
but
a
small
thing
and
his
life
but
as
the
flower
of
the
grass
across
the
plain
of
tver
before
the
north
wind
a
single
sleigh
was
tearing
as
fast
as
horse
could
lay
hoof
to
ground
a
sleigh
driven
by
paul
howard
alexis
and
the
track
of
it
was
as
a
line
drawn
from
point
to
point
across
a
map
a
striking
feature
of
the
winter
of
northern
russia
is
the
glorious
uncertainty
of
its
snowfalls
at
tver
the
had
said
the
snow
has
not
all
fallen
yet
more
is
coming
it
is
yellow
in
the
sky
although
march
is
nearly
gone
the
landlord
of
the
hotel
a
good
enough
facing
the
broad
volga
had
urged
upon
le
prince
the
advisability
of
waiting
as
is
the
way
of
landlords
all
the
world
over
but
etta
had
shown
a
strange
restlessness
a
petulant
desire
to
hurry
forward
at
all
risks
she
hated
tver
the
hotel
was
uncomfortable
there
was
an
unhealthy
smell
about
the
place
paul
acceded
readily
enough
to
her
wishes
he
rather
liked
tver
in
a
way
he
was
proud
of
this
busy
town
a
centre
of
russian
civilization
he
would
have
liked
etta
to
be
favorably
impressed
with
it
as
any
prejudice
would
naturally
reflect
upon
osterno
miles
across
the
steppe
but
with
a
characteristic
silent
patience
he
made
the
necessary
preparations
for
an
immediate
start
the
night
express
from
petersburg
had
deposited
them
on
the
platform
in
the
early
morning
steinmetz
had
preceded
them
closed
sleighs
from
osterno
were
awaiting
them
a
luxurious
breakfast
was
prepared
at
the
hotel
relays
of
horses
were
posted
along
the
road
the
journey
to
osterno
had
been
carefully
planned
and
arranged
by
steinmetz
a
king
among
organizers
the
sleigh
drive
across
the
steppe
was
to
be
accomplished
in
ten
hours
the
snow
had
begun
to
fall
as
they
clattered
across
the
floating
bridge
of
tver
it
had
fallen
ever
since
and
the
afternoon
lowered
gloomily
in
america
such
visitations
are
called
blizzards
here
in
russia
it
is
merely
the
snow
the
freezing
wind
is
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
at
a
distance
of
one
hundred
miles
from
tver
the
driver
of
the
sleigh
containing
etta
maggie
and
paul
had
suddenly
rolled
off
his
perch
his
hands
were
frostbitten
a
piteous
blue
face
peered
out
at
his
master
through
eyebrows
mustache
and
beard
in
a
moment
maggie
was
out
in
the
snow
beside
the
two
men
while
etta
hastily
closed
the
door
he
is
all
right
said
paul
it
is
only
the
cold
pour
some
brandy
into
his
mouth
while
i
hold
the
ice
aside
take
off
your
gloves
the
flask
will
stick
to
your
fingers
maggie
obeyed
with
her
usual
breezy
readiness
turning
to
nod
reassurance
to
etta
who
truth
to
tell
had
pulled
up
the
windows
shutting
out
the
whole
scene
he
must
come
inside
said
maggie
we
are
nice
and
warm
with
all
the
cans
paul
looked
rather
dubiously
toward
the
sleigh
you
can
carry
him
i
suppose
said
the
girl
cheerfully
he
is
not
very
big
he
is
all
fur
coat
etta
looked
rather
disgusted
but
made
no
objection
while
paul
lifted
the
frozen
man
into
the
seat
he
had
just
vacated
when
you
are
cold
i
will
drive
cried
maggie
as
paul
shut
the
door
i
should
love
it
thus
it
came
about
that
a
single
sleigh
was
speeding
across
the
plain
of
tver
paul
with
the
composure
that
comes
of
a
large
experience
gathered
the
reins
in
his
two
hands
driving
with
both
and
with
extended
arms
after
the
manner
of
russian
yemschiks
for
a
man
must
accommodate
himself
to
circumstance
and
fingerless
gloves
are
not
conducive
to
a
finished
style
of
handling
the
ribbons
this
driver
knew
that
the
next
station
was
twenty
miles
off
that
at
any
moment
the
horses
might
break
down
or
plunge
into
a
drift
he
knew
that
in
the
event
of
such
emergencies
it
would
be
singularly
easy
for
four
people
to
die
of
cold
within
a
few
miles
of
help
but
he
had
faced
such
possibilities
a
hundred
times
before
in
this
vast
country
where
the
standard
price
of
a
human
life
is
no
great
sum
he
was
not
therefore
dismayed
but
rather
took
delight
in
battling
with
the
elements
as
all
strong
men
should
and
most
of
them
thank
heaven
do
moreover
he
battled
successfully
and
before
the
moon
was
well
up
drew
rein
outside
the
village
of
osterno
to
accede
at
last
to
the
prayer
of
the
driver
that
he
might
return
to
his
task
it
is
not
meet
the
man
had
gruffly
said
whenever
a
short
halt
was
made
to
change
horses
that
a
great
prince
should
drive
a
yemschik
it
is
meet
answered
paul
simply
for
one
man
to
help
another
then
this
man
of
deeds
and
not
of
words
clambered
into
the
sleigh
and
drew
up
the
windows
hiding
his
head
as
he
drove
through
his
own
village
where
every
man
was
dependent
for
life
and
being
on
his
charity
they
were
silent
for
the
ladies
were
tired
and
cold
we
shall
soon
be
there
said
paul
reassuringly
but
he
did
not
lower
the
windows
and
look
out
as
any
man
might
have
wished
to
do
on
returning
to
the
place
of
his
birth
maggie
sat
back
wrapped
in
her
furs
she
was
meditating
over
the
events
of
the
day
and
more
particularly
over
a
certain
skill
a
quickness
of
touch
a
deft
handling
of
stricken
men
which
she
had
noted
far
out
on
the
snowy
steppe
a
few
hours
earlier
paul
was
a
different
man
when
he
had
to
deal
with
pain
and
sickness
he
was
quicker
brighter
full
of
confidence
in
himself
for
the
great
sympathy
was
his
that
love
of
the
neighbor
which
is
thrown
like
a
mantle
over
the
shoulders
of
some
men
making
them
different
from
their
fellows
securing
to
them
that
love
of
great
and
small
which
perchance
follows
some
when
they
are
dead
to
that
place
where
a
human
testimony
may
not
be
all
in
vain
at
the
castle
all
was
in
readiness
for
the
prince
and
princess
their
departure
from
tver
having
been
telegraphed
on
the
threshold
of
the
great
house
before
she
had
entered
the
magnificent
hall
etta
eyes
brightened
her
fatigue
vanished
she
played
her
part
before
the
crowd
of
bowing
servants
with
that
forgetfulness
of
mere
bodily
fatigue
which
is
expected
of
princesses
and
other
great
ladies
she
swept
up
the
broad
staircase
leaning
on
paul
arm
with
a
carriage
a
presence
a
dazzling
wealth
of
beauty
which
did
not
fail
to
impress
the
onlookers
whatever
etta
may
have
failed
to
bring
to
paul
howard
alexis
as
a
wife
she
made
him
a
matchless
princess
he
led
her
straight
through
the
to
the
suite
of
rooms
which
were
hers
these
consisted
of
an
a
small
and
her
private
apartments
beyond
paul
stopped
in
the
looking
round
with
a
simple
satisfaction
in
all
that
had
been
done
by
his
orders
for
etta
comfort
these
he
said
are
your
rooms
he
was
no
adept
at
turning
a
neat
phrase
at
reeling
off
a
pretty
honeymoon
welcome
perhaps
he
expected
her
to
express
delight
to
come
to
him
possibly
and
kiss
him
as
some
women
would
have
done
she
looked
round
critically
yes
she
said
they
are
very
nice
she
crossed
the
room
and
drew
aside
the
curtain
that
covered
the
windows
the
room
was
so
warm
that
there
was
no
rime
on
the
panes
she
gave
a
little
shudder
and
he
went
to
her
side
putting
his
strong
quiet
arm
around
her
below
them
stretching
away
beneath
the
brilliant
moonlight
lay
the
country
that
was
his
inheritance
an
estate
as
large
as
a
large
english
county
immediately
beneath
them
at
the
foot
of
the
great
rock
upon
which
the
castle
was
built
nestled
the
village
of
osterno
straggling
squalid
oh
she
said
dully
this
is
siberia
this
is
terrible
it
had
never
presented
itself
to
him
in
that
light
the
wonderful
stretch
of
country
over
which
they
were
looking
it
is
not
so
bad
he
said
in
the
daylight
and
that
was
all
for
he
had
no
persuasive
tongue
that
is
the
village
he
went
on
after
a
little
pause
those
are
the
people
who
look
to
us
to
help
them
in
their
fight
against
terrible
odds
i
hoped
that
you
would
be
interested
in
them
she
looked
down
curiously
at
the
little
wooden
huts
in
the
snow
the
smoking
chimneys
the
twinkling
curtainless
windows
what
do
you
expect
me
to
do
she
asked
in
a
queer
voice
he
looked
at
her
in
a
sort
of
wonderment
perhaps
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
woman
should
have
no
need
to
ask
such
a
question
it
is
a
long
story
he
said
i
will
tell
you
about
it
another
time
you
are
tired
now
after
your
journey
his
arm
slipped
from
her
waist
they
stood
side
by
side
and
both
were
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
difference
they
were
not
the
same
as
they
had
been
in
london
the
atmosphere
of
russia
seemed
to
have
had
some
subtle
effect
upon
them
etta
turned
and
sat
slowly
down
on
a
low
chair
before
the
fire
she
had
thrown
her
furs
aside
and
they
lay
in
a
luxurious
heap
on
the
floor
the
maids
hearing
that
the
prince
and
princess
were
together
waited
silently
in
the
next
room
behind
the
closed
door
i
think
i
had
better
hear
it
now
said
etta
but
you
are
tired
protested
her
husband
you
had
better
rest
until
no
i
am
not
tired
he
came
toward
her
and
stood
with
one
elbow
on
the
looking
down
at
her
a
quiet
strong
man
who
had
already
forgotten
his
feat
of
endurance
of
a
few
hours
earlier
these
people
he
said
would
die
of
starvation
and
cold
and
sickness
if
we
did
not
help
them
it
is
simply
impossible
for
them
in
the
few
months
that
they
can
work
the
land
to
cultivate
it
so
as
to
yield
any
more
than
their
taxes
they
are
overtaxed
and
no
one
cares
the
army
must
be
kept
up
and
a
huge
civil
service
and
no
one
cares
what
happens
to
the
peasants
some
day
the
peasants
turn
but
not
yet
it
is
a
question
for
all
russian
to
face
and
nobody
faces
it
if
any
one
tries
to
improve
the
condition
of
his
peasants
they
were
happier
a
thousand
times
as
serfs
the
bureaucrats
of
petersburg
mark
him
down
and
he
is
forced
to
leave
the
country
the
whole
fabric
of
this
government
is
rotten
but
except
the
peasants
would
suffer
by
its
fall
and
therefore
it
stands
etta
was
staring
into
the
fire
it
was
impossible
to
say
whether
she
heard
with
comprehension
or
not
paul
went
on
there
is
nothing
left
therefore
but
to
go
and
do
good
by
stealth
i
studied
medicine
with
that
view
steinmetz
has
scraped
and
economized
the
working
of
the
estate
for
the
same
purpose
the
government
will
not
allow
us
to
have
a
doctor
they
prevent
us
from
organizing
relief
and
education
on
anything
like
an
adequate
scale
they
do
it
all
by
underhand
means
they
have
not
the
pluck
to
oppose
us
openly
for
years
we
have
been
doing
what
we
can
we
have
almost
eradicated
cholera
they
do
not
die
of
starvation
now
and
they
are
learning
very
slowly
but
still
they
are
learning
we
i
thought
you
might
be
interested
in
your
people
you
might
want
to
help
she
gave
a
short
little
nod
there
was
a
suggestion
of
suspense
in
her
whole
being
and
attitude
as
if
she
were
waiting
to
hear
something
which
she
knew
could
not
be
avoided
a
few
years
ago
he
went
on
a
gigantic
scheme
was
set
on
foot
i
told
you
a
little
about
it
the
charity
league
her
lips
moved
but
no
sound
came
from
them
so
she
nodded
a
second
time
a
tiny
on
the
struck
seven
and
she
looked
up
in
a
startled
way
as
if
the
sound
had
frightened
her
the
castle
was
quite
still
silence
seemed
to
brood
over
the
old
walls
that
fell
through
he
went
on
as
i
told
you
it
was
betrayed
stépan
lanovitch
was
banished
he
has
escaped
however
steinmetz
has
seen
him
he
succeeded
in
destroying
some
of
the
papers
before
the
place
was
searched
after
the
robbery
one
paper
in
particular
if
he
had
not
destroyed
that
i
should
have
been
banished
i
was
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
charity
league
steinmetz
and
i
got
the
thing
up
it
would
have
been
for
the
happiness
of
millions
of
peasants
if
it
had
not
been
betrayed
in
time
we
shall
find
out
who
did
it
he
paused
he
did
not
say
what
he
would
do
when
he
had
found
out
etta
was
staring
into
the
fire
her
lips
were
dry
she
hardly
seemed
to
be
breathing
it
is
possible
he
went
on
in
his
strong
quiet
inexorable
voice
that
stépan
lanovitch
knows
now
etta
did
not
move
she
was
staring
into
the
fire
staring
staring
then
she
slowly
fainted
rolling
from
the
low
chair
to
the
fur
paul
picked
her
up
like
a
child
and
carried
her
to
the
bedroom
where
the
maids
were
waiting
to
dress
her
here
he
said
your
mistress
has
fainted
from
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
and
with
his
practised
medical
knowledge
he
himself
tended
her

always

laughed
steinmetz
rubbing
his
broad
hands
together
and
looking
down
into
the
face
of
maggie
who
was
busy
at
the
yes
answered
the
girl
glancing
toward
paul
leaning
against
the
window
reading
his
letters
yes
always
gay
why
not
karl
steinmetz
saw
the
glance
it
was
one
of
the
little
daily
incidents
that
one
sees
and
half
forgets
he
only
half
forgot
it
why
not
indeed
he
answered
and
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
ivanovitch
is
as
ready
as
yourself
this
morning
to
treat
the
matter
as
a
joke
he
is
none
the
worse
for
his
freezing
and
all
the
better
for
his
experience
you
have
added
another
friend
my
dear
young
lady
to
a
list
which
is
doubtless
a
very
long
one
he
is
a
nice
man
answered
maggie
how
is
it
she
asked
after
a
little
pause
that
there
are
more
men
in
the
lower
classes
whom
one
can
call
nice
than
among
their
betters
paul
paused
between
two
letters
hearing
the
question
he
looked
up
as
if
interested
in
the
answer
but
did
not
join
in
the
conversation
because
dealing
with
animals
and
with
nature
is
more
conducive
to
niceness
than
too
much
trafficking
with
human
beings
replied
steinmetz
promptly
i
suppose
that
is
it
said
maggie
lifting
the
lid
and
looking
in
at
all
events
it
is
the
sort
of
answer
one
might
expect
from
you
you
are
always
hard
on
human
nature
i
take
it
as
i
find
it
replied
steinmetz
with
a
laugh
but
i
do
not
worry
about
it
like
some
people
now
paul
would
like
to
alter
the
course
of
the
world
as
he
spoke
he
half
turned
toward
paul
as
if
suggesting
that
he
should
give
an
opinion
and
this
little
action
had
the
effect
of
putting
a
stop
to
the
conversation
maggie
had
plenty
to
say
to
steinmetz
but
toward
paul
her
mental
attitude
was
different
she
was
probably
unaware
of
this
little
fact
there
she
said
after
a
pause
i
have
obeyed
etta
instructions
she
does
not
want
us
to
begin
i
suppose
no
replied
paul
she
will
be
down
in
a
minute
i
hope
the
princess
is
not
overtired
said
steinmetz
with
a
certain
formal
politeness
which
seemed
to
accompany
any
mention
of
etta
name
not
at
all
thank
you
replied
etta
herself
coming
into
the
room
at
that
moment
she
looked
fresh
and
on
the
contrary
i
am
full
of
energy
and
eagerness
to
explore
the
castle
one
naturally
takes
an
interest
in
one
baronial
halls
with
this
she
walked
slowly
across
to
the
window
she
stood
there
looking
out
and
every
one
in
the
room
was
watching
on
looking
for
the
first
time
on
the
same
view
a
few
moments
earlier
maggie
had
uttered
a
little
cry
of
surprise
and
had
then
remained
silent
etta
looked
out
of
the
window
and
said
nothing
it
was
a
most
singular
weird
uncouth
prehistoric
as
some
parts
of
the
earth
still
are
the
castle
was
built
on
the
edge
of
a
perpendicular
cliff
on
this
side
it
was
impregnable
any
object
dropped
from
the
window
would
fall
a
clear
two
hundred
feet
to
the
brawling
oster
river
the
rock
was
black
and
shining
like
the
topmost
crags
of
an
alpine
mountain
where
snow
and
ice
have
polished
the
bare
stone
beyond
and
across
the
river
lay
the
boundless
steppe
a
sheet
of
virgin
snow
etta
stood
looking
over
this
to
the
far
horizon
where
the
white
snow
and
the
gray
sky
softly
merged
into
one
her
first
remark
was
characteristic
as
first
and
last
remarks
usually
are
and
as
far
as
you
can
see
is
yours
she
asked
yes
answered
paul
simply
with
that
calm
which
only
comes
with
hereditary
possession
the
observation
attracted
steinmetz
attention
he
went
to
another
window
and
looked
across
the
waste
critically
four
times
as
far
as
we
can
see
is
his
he
said
etta
looked
out
slowly
and
comprehensively
absorbing
it
all
like
a
long
sweet
drink
there
was
no
hereditary
calmness
in
her
sense
of
possession
and
where
is
thors
she
asked
paul
stretched
out
his
arm
pointing
with
a
lean
steady
finger
it
lies
out
there
he
answered
another
of
the
little
incidents
that
are
only
half
forgotten
some
of
the
persons
assembled
in
that
room
remembered
the
pointing
finger
long
afterward
it
makes
one
feel
very
small
said
etta
turning
to
the
at
no
time
a
pleasant
sensation
do
you
know
she
said
after
a
little
pause
i
think
it
probable
that
i
shall
become
very
fond
of
osterno
but
i
wish
it
was
nearer
to
civilization
paul
looked
pleased
steinmetz
had
a
queer
expression
on
his
face
maggie
murmured
something
about
one
surroundings
making
but
little
difference
to
one
happiness
and
the
subject
was
wisely
shelved
after
breakfast
steinmetz
withdrew
now
said
paul
shall
i
show
you
the
old
place
you
and
maggie
etta
signified
her
readiness
but
maggie
said
that
she
had
letters
to
write
that
etta
could
show
her
the
castle
another
time
when
the
men
were
out
shooting
perhaps
but
said
etta
i
shall
do
it
horribly
badly
they
are
not
my
ancestors
you
know
i
shall
attach
the
stories
to
the
wrong
people
and
locate
the
ghost
in
the
wrong
room
you
will
be
wise
to
take
guidance
no
thank
you
replied
maggie
quite
firmly
and
frankly
i
feel
inclined
to
write
and
the
feeling
is
rare
so
i
must
take
advantage
of
it
the
girl
looked
at
her
cousin
with
something
in
her
honest
blue
eyes
that
almost
amounted
to
wonder
etta
was
always
surprising
her
there
was
a
whole
gamut
of
feeling
an
octave
of
callow
girlish
instincts
of
which
etta
seemed
to
be
deprived
if
she
had
ever
had
them
no
trace
was
left
of
their
whilom
presence
at
first
maggie
had
flatly
refused
to
come
to
russia
when
paul
pressed
her
to
do
so
she
accepted
with
a
sort
of
wonder
there
was
something
which
she
did
not
understand
the
same
instinct
made
her
refuse
now
to
accompany
paul
and
etta
over
their
new
home
again
etta
pressed
her
showing
her
lack
of
some
feeling
which
maggie
indefinitely
knew
she
ought
to
have
had
this
time
paul
made
no
sign
he
added
no
word
to
etta
persuasions
but
stood
gravely
looking
at
his
wife
when
the
door
had
closed
behind
them
maggie
stood
for
some
minutes
by
the
window
looking
out
over
the
plain
the
rugged
broken
rocks
beneath
her
then
she
turned
to
the
she
resolutely
took
pen
and
paper
but
the
least
thing
seemed
to
distract
her
attention
the
coronet
on
the
cost
her
five
minutes
of
reflection
she
took
up
the
pen
again
and
wrote
dear
mother
the
room
grew
darker
maggie
looked
up
the
snow
had
begun
again
it
was
driving
past
the
window
with
a
silent
purposeful
monotony
the
girl
drew
the
toward
her
she
examined
the
pen
critically
and
dipped
it
into
the
ink
but
she
added
nothing
to
the
two
words
already
written
the
castle
of
osterno
is
almost
unique
in
the
particular
that
one
roof
covers
the
ancient
and
the
modern
buildings
the
vast
worthy
of
the
name
of
adjoin
the
small
apartments
of
the
fortress
which
paul
ancestors
held
against
the
tartars
this
grimmer
side
of
the
building
paul
reserved
to
the
last
for
reasons
of
his
own
and
etta
manifest
delight
in
the
grandeur
of
the
more
modern
apartments
fully
rewarded
him
here
again
that
side
of
her
character
manifested
itself
which
has
already
been
shown
she
was
dazzled
and
exhilarated
by
the
splendor
of
it
all
and
the
immediate
effect
was
a
feeling
of
affection
toward
the
man
to
whom
this
belonged
who
was
in
act
if
not
in
word
laying
it
at
her
feet
when
they
passed
from
the
lofty
rooms
to
the
dimmer
passages
of
the
old
castle
etta
spirits
visibly
dropped
her
interest
slackened
he
told
her
of
tragedies
enacted
in
times
such
ancient
tales
of
violent
death
and
broken
hearts
as
attach
themselves
to
gray
stone
walls
and
dungeon
keeps
she
only
half
listened
for
her
mind
was
busy
with
the
splendors
they
had
left
behind
with
the
purposes
to
which
such
splendors
could
be
turned
and
the
sum
total
of
her
thoughts
was
gratified
vanity
her
bright
presence
awakened
the
gloom
of
ages
within
the
dimly
lit
historic
rooms
her
laugh
sounded
strangely
light
and
frivolous
and
shallow
in
the
silence
of
the
ages
which
had
brooded
within
these
walls
since
the
days
of
tamerlane
it
was
perhaps
the
greatest
tragedy
of
the
alexis
family
this
beautiful
tragedy
that
walked
by
the
side
of
paul
i
am
glad
your
grandfather
brought
french
architects
here
and
built
the
modern
side
she
said
these
rooms
are
of
course
very
interesting
but
gloomy
horribly
gloomy
paul
there
is
a
smell
of
ghosts
and
dulness
all
the
same
i
like
these
rooms
answered
paul
steinmetz
and
i
used
to
live
entirely
on
this
side
of
the
house
this
is
the
we
shot
those
bears
and
all
the
deer
that
is
a
wolf
head
he
killed
a
keeper
before
i
finished
him
off
etta
looked
at
her
husband
with
a
curious
little
smile
she
sometimes
felt
proud
of
him
despite
the
ever
present
knowledge
that
intellectually
speaking
she
was
his
superior
there
was
something
strong
and
simple
and
manly
in
a
sort
of
mediaeval
way
that
pleased
her
in
this
big
husband
of
hers
and
how
did
you
finish
him
off
she
asked
i
choked
him
that
bear
knocked
me
down
but
steinmetz
shot
him
we
were
four
days
out
in
the
open
after
that
elk
this
is
a
lynx
a
queer
face
rather
like
de
chauxville
the
dogs
killed
him
but
why
do
you
not
paper
the
room
asked
etta
with
a
shiver
instead
of
this
gloomy
panelling
it
is
so
mysterious
and
creepy
quite
suggestive
of
secret
passages
there
are
no
secret
passages
answered
paul
but
there
is
a
room
behind
here
this
is
the
door
i
will
show
it
to
you
presently
i
have
things
in
there
i
want
to
show
you
i
keep
all
my
medicines
and
appliances
in
there
it
is
our
secret
surgery
and
office
in
that
room
the
charity
league
was
organized
etta
turned
away
suddenly
and
went
to
the
narrow
window
where
she
sat
on
a
low
looking
down
into
the
depths
i
did
not
know
you
were
a
doctor
she
said
i
doctor
the
peasants
replied
paul
in
a
way
i
took
my
degree
on
purpose
but
of
course
they
do
not
know
that
it
is
i
they
think
i
am
a
doctor
from
moscow
i
put
on
an
old
coat
and
wear
a
scarf
so
that
they
can
not
see
my
face
i
only
go
to
them
at
night
it
would
never
do
for
the
government
to
know
that
we
attempt
to
do
good
to
the
peasants
we
have
to
keep
it
a
secret
even
from
the
people
themselves
and
they
hate
us
they
groan
and
hoot
when
we
drive
through
the
village
but
they
never
attempt
to
do
us
any
harm
they
are
too
much
afraid
of
us
when
etta
rose
and
came
toward
him
her
face
was
colorless
let
me
see
this
room
she
said
he
opened
the
door
and
followed
her
into
the
apartment
which
has
already
been
described
here
he
told
further
somewhat
bald
details
of
the
work
he
had
attempted
to
do
it
is
to
be
feared
that
he
made
neither
an
interesting
nor
a
romantic
story
of
it
there
were
too
many
details
too
much
statistic
and
no
thrilling
realism
whatever
the
experiences
of
a
youthful
curate
in
bethnal
green
would
have
made
high
tragedy
beside
the
tale
that
this
man
told
his
wife
of
the
land
upon
which
god
has
assuredly
laid
his
curse
aceldama
the
field
of
blood
etta
listened
and
despite
herself
she
became
interested
she
was
sitting
in
a
chair
usually
occupied
by
steinmetz
there
was
a
faint
aroma
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
was
manly
and
energetic
paul
showed
her
his
simple
stores
of
medicine
the
old
coat
saturated
with
disinfectants
which
had
become
the
recognized
outward
sign
of
the
moscow
doctor
and
do
other
people
other
noblemen
try
to
do
this
sort
of
thing
too
asked
etta
at
length
catrina
lanovitch
does
replied
paul
what
the
girl
with
the
hair
yes
answered
paul
he
had
never
noticed
catrina
hair
appraising
eye
had
seen
more
in
one
second
than
paul
had
perceived
in
twenty
years
yes
he
answered
but
of
course
she
is
handicapped
by
her
appearance
no
by
her
circumstances
her
name
is
sufficient
to
handicap
her
every
moment
in
this
country
but
she
does
a
great
deal
she
she
found
me
out
confound
her
etta
had
risen
she
was
looking
curiously
at
the
cupboard
where
infected
clothes
were
hanging
he
had
forbidden
her
to
go
near
it
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
found
you
out
how
she
asked
with
a
queer
smile
saw
through
my
disguise
yes
she
would
do
that
said
etta
aloud
to
herself
what
is
this
door
she
asked
after
a
pause
it
leads
to
an
inner
room
replied
paul
where
steinmetz
usually
works
he
passed
in
front
of
her
and
opened
the
door
as
he
was
doing
so
etta
went
on
in
the
train
of
her
thoughts
so
catrina
knows
yes
and
no
one
else
paul
made
no
answer
for
he
had
passed
on
into
the
smaller
room
where
steinmetz
was
seated
at
a
except
of
course
herr
steinmetz
etta
went
on
interrogatively
madame
said
the
german
looking
up
with
his
pleasant
smile
i
know
and
he
went
on
writing
chapter

the
table
of
the
hôtel
de
moscou
at
tver
had
just
begun
the
soup
had
been
removed
the
diners
were
engaged
in
igniting
their
first
cigarette
at
the
candles
placed
between
each
pair
of
them
for
that
purpose
by
nature
the
modern
russian
is
a
dignified
and
somewhat
reserved
gentleman
by
circumstance
he
has
been
schooled
into
a
state
of
guarded
unsociability
if
there
is
a
seat
at
a
public
table
conveniently
removed
from
those
occupied
by
earlier
arrivals
the
invariably
takes
it
in
russia
one
converses
as
in
scotland
one
jokes
with
difficulty
a
russian
table
is
therefore
any
thing
but
hilarious
in
its
tendency
a
certain
number
of
gentlemen
and
a
few
ladies
are
visibly
constrained
by
the
force
of
circumstance
to
dine
at
the
same
table
and
hour
et
voilà
tout
there
is
no
pretence
that
any
more
sociable
and
neighborly
motive
has
brought
them
together
indeed
they
each
suspect
the
other
of
being
a
german
or
a
nihilist
or
worse
still
a
government
servant
they
therefore
sit
as
far
apart
as
possible
and
smoke
cigarettes
between
and
during
the
courses
with
that
absorption
which
would
be
rude
if
it
were
not
entirely
satisfactory
to
the
average
briton
the
ladies
of
course
have
the
same
easy
method
of
showing
a
desire
for
silence
and
reflection
in
a
country
where
nurses
carrying
infants
usually
smoke
in
the
streets
and
where
a
dainty
confectioner
assistant
places
her
cigarette
between
her
lips
in
order
to
leave
her
hands
free
for
the
service
of
her
customers
the
table
of
the
hôtel
de
moscou
at
tver
was
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
in
russia
by
the
way
there
are
no
exceptions
to
general
rules
the
personal
habits
of
the
native
of
cronstadt
differ
in
no
way
from
those
of
the

living
in
petropavlovsk
eight
thousand
miles
away
around
the
long
table
of
the
host
were
seated
at
respectable
intervals
a
dozen
or
more
gentlemen
who
gazed
stolidly
at
each
other
from
time
to
time
while
the
host
himself
smiled
broadly
upon
them
all
from
that
end
of
the
room
where
the
lift
and
the
smell
of
cooking
exercise
their
calling
the
one
to
spoil
the
appetite
the
other
to
pander
to
it
when
spoilt
of
these
dozen
gentlemen
we
have
only
to
deal
with
one
a
man
of
broad
high
forehead
of
colorless
eyes
of
a
face
who
consumed
what
was
put
before
him
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
known
in
paris
as
ce
bon
vassili
this
traveller
but
in
paris
one
does
not
always
use
the
word
bon
in
its
english
sense
of
good
vassili
was
evidently
desirous
of
attracting
as
little
attention
as
circumstances
would
allow
he
was
obviously
doing
his
best
to
look
like
one
who
travelled
in
the
interest
of
braid
or
buttons
moreover
when
claude
de
chauxville
entered
the
table
room
he
concealed
whatever
surprise
he
may
have
felt
behind
a
cloud
of
cigarette
smoke
through
the
same
blue
haze
he
met
the
frenchman
eye
a
moment
later
without
the
faintest
twinkle
of
recognition
these
two
worthies
went
through
the
weird
courses
provided
by
a
cook
professing
a
knowledge
of
french
without
taking
any
compromising
notice
of
each
other
when
the
meal
was
over
vassili
inscribed
the
number
of
his
bedroom
in
large
figures
on
the
label
of
his
bottle
of
emilion
after
the
manner
of
wise
in
continental
hotels
he
subsequently
turned
the
bottle
round
so
that
claude
de
chauxville
could
scarcely
fail
to
read
the
number
and
with
a
vague
and
general
bow
he
left
the
room
in
his
apartment
the
genial
vassili
threw
more
wood
into
the
stove
drew
forward
the
two
regulation
and
lighted
all
the
candles
provided
he
then
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
liqueurs
there
was
evidently
something
in
the
nature
of
an
entertainment
about
to
take
place
in
apartment
no
of
the
hôtel
de
moscou
before
long
a
discreet
knock
announced
the
arrival
of
the
expected
visitor
entrez
cried
vassili
and
de
chauxville
stood
before
him
with
a
smile
which
in
french
is
called
crâne
a
pleasure
said
vassili
behind
his
wooden
face
that
i
did
not
anticipate
in
tver
and
consequently
one
that
carries
its
own
mitigation
an
unanticipated
pleasure
mon
ami
is
always
inopportune
i
make
no
doubt
that
you
were
sorry
to
see
me
on
the
contrary
will
you
sit
i
can
hardly
believe
went
on
de
chauxville
taking
the
proffered
chair
that
my
appearance
was
opportune
on
the
principle
ha
ha
that
a
flower
growing
out
of
place
is
a
weed
gentlemen
of
the
eh
home
office
prefer
i
know
to
travel
quietly
he
spread
out
his
expressive
hands
as
if
smoothing
the
path
of
vassili
through
this
stony
world
incognito
he
added
guilelessly
one
does
not
publish
one
name
from
the
housetops
replied
the
russian
with
a
glimmer
of
pride
in
his
eyes
especially
if
it
happen
to
be
not
quite
obscure
but
between
friends
my
dear
baron
between
friends
yes
then
what
are
you
doing
in
tver
enquired
de
chauxville
with
engaging
frankness
ah
that
is
a
long
story
but
i
will
tell
you
never
fear
i
will
tell
you
on
the
usual
terms
viz
enquired
the
frenchman
lighting
a
cigarette
vassili
accepted
the
match
with
a
bow
and
did
likewise
he
blew
a
guileless
cloud
of
smoke
toward
the
dingy
ceiling
exchange
my
dear
baron
exchange
oh
certainly
replied
de
chauxville
who
knew
that
vassili
was
in
all
probability
fully
informed
as
to
his
movements
past
and
prospective
i
am
going
to
visit
some
old
friends
in
this
government
the
lanovitches
at
thors
ah
you
know
them
vassili
raised
his
shoulders
and
made
a
little
gesture
with
his
cigarette
as
much
as
to
say
why
ask
de
chauxville
looked
at
his
companion
keenly
he
was
wondering
whether
this
man
knew
that
he
claude
de
chauxville
loved
etta
howard
alexis
and
consequently
hated
her
husband
he
was
wondering
how
much
or
how
little
this
impenetrable
individual
knew
and
suspected
i
have
always
said
observed
vassili
suddenly
that
for
unmitigated
impertinence
give
me
a
diplomatist
ah
and
what
would
you
desire
that
i
should
for
the
same
commodity
give
you
now
a
woman
there
was
a
short
silence
in
the
room
while
these
two
birds
of
a
feather
reflected
suddenly
vassili
tapped
himself
on
the
chest
with
his
forefinger
it
was
i
he
said
who
crushed
that
very
dangerous
movement
the
charity
league
i
know
it
a
movement
my
dear
baron
to
educate
the
moujik
if
you
please
to
feed
him
and
clothe
him
and
teach
him
to
be
discontented
with
his
lot
to
raise
him
up
and
make
a
man
of
him
pah
he
is
a
beast
let
him
be
treated
as
such
let
him
work
if
he
will
not
work
let
him
starve
and
die
the
man
who
can
not
contribute
toward
the
support
of
those
above
him
in
life
is
superfluous
said
de
chauxville
glibly
precisely
now
my
dear
baron
listen
to
me
the
genial
vassili
leaned
forward
and
tapped
with
one
finger
on
the
knee
of
de
chauxville
as
if
knocking
at
the
door
of
his
attention
i
am
all
ears
mon
bon
monsieur
replied
the
frenchman
rather
coldly
he
had
just
been
reflecting
that
after
all
he
did
not
want
any
favor
from
vassili
for
the
moment
and
the
manner
of
the
latter
was
verging
on
the
familiar
the
woman
who
sold
me
the
charity
league
papers
dined
at
my
house
in
paris
a
fortnight
ago
said
vassili
with
a
staccato
tap
on
his
companion
knee
by
way
of
emphasis
to
each
word
then
my
friend
i
can
not
congratulate
you
on
the
society
in
which
you
move
replied
de
chauxville
mimicking
his
manner
bah
she
was
a
princess
a
princess
yes
of
your
acquaintance
le
baron
and
she
came
to
my
house
with
her
eh
husband
the
prince
paul
howard
alexis
this
was
news
indeed
de
chauxville
leaned
back
and
passed
his
slim
white
hand
across
his
brow
with
a
slow
pressure
as
if
wiping
some
writing
from
a
slate
as
if
his
forehead
bore
the
writing
of
his
thoughts
and
he
was
wiping
it
away
and
the
thoughts
he
thus
concealed
who
can
count
them
for
thoughts
are
the
quickest
and
the
longest
and
the
saddest
things
of
this
life
the
first
thought
was
that
if
he
had
known
this
three
months
earlier
he
could
have
made
etta
marry
him
and
that
thought
had
a
thousand
branches
with
etta
for
his
wife
he
might
have
been
a
different
man
one
can
never
tell
what
the
effect
of
an
acquired
desire
may
be
one
can
only
judge
by
analogy
and
it
would
seem
that
it
is
a
frustrated
desire
that
makes
the
majority
of
villains
but
the
news
coming
thus
too
late
only
served
an
evil
purpose
for
in
that
flash
of
thought
claude
de
chauxville
saw
paul
secrets
given
to
him
paul
wealth
meted
out
to
him
paul
in
exile
paul
dead
in
siberia
where
death
comes
easily
paul
widow
claude
de
wife
he
wiped
all
the
thoughts
away
and
showed
to
vassili
a
face
that
was
as
composed
and
impertinent
as
usual
you
said
eh
husband
he
observed
why
why
did
you
add
that
little
my
friend
vassili
rose
and
walked
to
the
door
that
led
through
into
his
bedroom
from
the
salon
in
which
they
were
sitting
it
was
possible
to
enter
the
bedroom
from
another
door
and
overhear
any
conversation
that
might
be
passing
in
the
the
investigation
was
apparently
satisfactory
for
the
russian
came
back
but
he
did
not
sit
down
instead
he
stood
leaning
against
the
tall
china
stove
needless
to
tell
you
he
observed
the
antecedents
of
the
princess
quite
needless
married
seven
years
ago
to
charles
sydney
bamborough
promptly
giving
the
unnecessary
information
which
was
not
wanted
de
chauxville
nodded
where
is
sydney
bamborough
asked
vassili
with
his
smile
dead
replied
the
other
quietly
prove
it
de
chauxville
looked
up
sharply
the
cigarette
dropped
from
his
fingers
to
the
floor
his
face
was
yellow
and
drawn
with
a
singular
tremble
of
the
lips
which
were
twisted
to
one
side
good
god
he
whispered
hoarsely
there
was
only
one
thought
in
his
mind
a
sudden
wild
desire
to
rise
up
and
stand
by
etta
against
the
whole
world
verily
we
can
not
tell
what
love
may
make
of
us
whither
it
may
lead
us
we
only
know
that
it
never
leaves
us
as
it
found
us
then
leaning
quietly
against
the
stove
vassili
stated
his
case
rather
more
than
a
year
ago
he
said
i
received
an
offer
of
the
papers
connected
with
a
great
scheme
in
this
country
after
certain
enquiries
had
been
made
i
accepted
the
offer
i
paid
a
fabulous
price
for
the
papers
they
were
brought
to
me
by
a
lady
wearing
a
thick
veil
a
lady
i
had
never
seen
before
i
asked
no
questions
and
paid
her
the
money
it
subsequently
transpired
that
the
papers
had
been
stolen
as
you
perhaps
know
from
the
house
of
count
stépan
lanovitch
the
house
to
which
you
happen
to
be
going
at
thors
well
that
is
all
ancient
history
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
the
papers
were
stolen
by
sydney
bamborough
who
brought
them
here
probably
to
this
hotel
where
his
wife
was
staying
he
handed
her
the
papers
and
she
conveyed
them
to
me
in
paris
but
before
she
reached
petersburg
they
would
have
been
missed
by
stépan
lanovitch
who
would
naturally
suspect
the
man
who
had
been
staying
in
his
house
bamborough
a
man
with
a
doubtful
reputation
in
the
diplomatic
world
a
professed
doer
of
dirty
jobs
foreseeing
this
and
knowing
that
the
league
was
a
big
thing
with
a
few
violent
members
on
its
books
sydney
bamborough
did
not
attempt
to
leave
russia
by
the
western
route
he
probably
decided
to
go
through
nijni
down
the
volga
across
the
caspian
and
so
on
to
persia
and
india
you
follow
me
perfectly
answered
de
chauxville
coldly
i
have
been
here
a
week
went
on
the
russian
spy
making
enquiries
i
have
worked
the
whole
affair
out
link
by
link
till
the
evening
when
the
husband
and
wife
parted
she
went
west
with
the
papers
where
did
he
go
de
chauxville
picked
up
the
cigarette
looked
at
it
curiously
as
at
a
relic
the
relic
of
the
moment
of
strongest
emotion
through
which
he
had
ever
passed
and
threw
it
into
the
he
did
not
speak
and
after
a
moment
vassili
went
on
stating
his
case
with
clearness
a
body
was
found
on
the
steppe
he
said
the
body
of
a
man
dressed
as
a
small
commercial
traveller
would
dress
he
had
a
little
money
in
his
pocket
but
nothing
to
identify
him
he
was
buried
here
in
tver
by
the
police
who
received
their
information
by
an
anonymous
posted
in
tver
the
person
who
had
found
the
body
did
not
want
to
be
implicated
in
any
enquiry
now
who
found
the
body
who
was
the
dead
man
sydney
bamborough
has
assumed
that
the
dead
man
was
her
husband
on
the
strength
of
that
assumption
she
has
become
a
princess
a
frail
foundation
upon
which
to
build
up
her
fortunes
eh
how
did
she
know
that
the
body
had
been
found
asked
de
chauxville
perceiving
the
weak
point
in
his
companion
chain
of
argument
it
was
reported
shortly
in
the
local
newspapers
replied
vassili
and
repeated
in
one
or
two
continental
journals
as
the
police
were
of
opinion
that
the
man
was
a
foreigner
any
one
watching
the
newspapers
would
see
it
otherwise
the
incident
might
pass
unobserved
and
you
think
said
de
chauxville
suppressing
his
excitement
with
an
effort
that
the
lady
has
risked
every
thing
upon
a
supposition
knowing
the
lady
i
do
de
chauxville
dull
eyes
gleamed
for
a
moment
with
an
unwonted
light
all
the
civilization
of
the
ages
will
not
eradicate
the
primary
instincts
of
men
and
one
of
these
in
good
and
bad
alike
is
to
protect
women
the
frenchman
bit
the
end
of
his
cigarette
and
angrily
wiped
the
tobacco
from
his
lips
she
may
have
information
of
which
you
are
ignorant
he
suggested
precisely
it
is
that
particular
point
which
gives
me
trouble
at
the
present
moment
it
is
that
that
i
wish
to
discover
de
chauxville
looked
up
coolly
he
saw
his
advantage
hence
your
sudden
flow
of
communicativeness
he
said
vassili
nodded
you
can
not
find
out
for
yourself
so
you
seek
my
help
went
on
the
frenchman
again
the
russian
nodded
his
head
and
your
price
said
de
chauxville
drawing
in
his
feet
and
leaning
forward
apparently
to
study
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
the
action
concealed
his
face
he
was
saving
etta
and
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
when
you
have
the
information
you
may
name
your
own
price
said
the
russian
coldly
there
was
a
long
silence
before
speaking
de
chauxville
turned
and
took
a
glass
of
liqueur
from
the
table
his
hand
was
not
quite
steady
he
raised
the
glass
quickly
and
emptied
it
then
he
rose
and
looked
at
his
watch
the
silence
was
a
compact
when
the
lady
dined
with
you
in
paris
did
she
recognize
you
he
asked
yes
but
she
did
not
know
that
i
recognized
her
for
the
moment
they
both
overlooked
steinmetz
de
chauxville
stood
reflecting
and
your
theory
he
said
respecting
sydney
bamborough
what
is
it
if
he
got
away
to
nijni
and
the
volga
it
is
probable
that
he
is
in
eastern
siberia
or
in
persia
at
this
moment
he
has
not
had
time
to
get
right
across
asia
yet
de
chauxville
moved
toward
the
door
with
his
fingers
on
the
handle
he
paused
again
i
leave
early
morning
he
said
vassili
nodded
or
rather
he
bowed
in
his
grand
way
then
de
chauxville
went
out
of
the
room
they
did
not
shake
hands
there
is
sometimes
shame
among
thieves
chapter
xxvii
in
the
web
what
i
propose
is
that
catrina
takes
you
for
a
drive
my
dear
baron
with
her
two
ponies
the
countess
had
taken
very
good
care
to
refrain
from
making
this
proposal
to
catrina
alone
she
was
one
of
those
mothers
who
rule
their
daughters
by
springing
surprises
upon
them
in
a
carefully
selected
company
where
the
daughter
is
not
free
to
reply
de
chauxville
bowed
with
outspread
hands
if
it
will
not
bore
mademoiselle
he
replied
the
countess
looked
at
her
daughter
with
an
unctuous
smile
as
if
to
urge
her
on
to
make
the
most
of
this
opportunity
it
was
one
of
the
countess
chief
troubles
that
she
could
not
by
hook
or
crook
involve
catrina
in
any
sort
of
a
love
intrigue
she
was
the
sort
of
mother
who
would
have
preferred
to
hear
scandal
about
her
daughter
to
hearing
nothing
if
it
will
not
freeze
monsieur
replied
catrina
with
uncompromising
honesty
de
chauxville
laughed
in
his
frank
way
i
am
not
afraid
of
coldness
of
the
atmosphere
mademoiselle
he
replied
i
am
most
anxious
to
see
your
beautiful
country
it
was
quite
dark
during
the
last
hour
of
my
journey
last
night
and
i
had
i
saw
nothing
you
will
see
nothing
but
snow
said
catrina
which
is
like
the
reserve
of
a
young
girl
added
the
frenchman
it
keeps
warm
that
which
is
beneath
it
you
need
not
be
afraid
with
catrina
chimed
in
the
countess
nodding
and
becking
in
a
manner
that
clearly
showed
her
assumption
to
herself
of
some
vague
compliment
she
drives
beautifully
she
is
not
nervous
in
that
way
i
have
never
seen
any
one
drive
like
her
i
have
no
doubt
said
de
chauxville
that
mademoiselle
hands
are
firm
despite
their
diminutiveness
the
countess
was
charmed
and
showed
it
she
frowned
at
catrina
who
remained
grave
and
looked
at
the
clock
when
would
you
like
to
go
she
asked
de
chauxville
with
that
complete
absence
of
affectation
which
the
russian
of
all
women
of
the
world
alone
have
mastered
in
their
conversation
with
men
am
i
not
at
your
service
now
and
always
responded
the
gallant
baron
i
hope
not
replied
catrina
quietly
there
are
occasions
when
i
have
no
use
for
you
shall
we
say
eleven
with
pleasure
then
i
will
go
and
write
my
letters
now
said
the
baron
quitting
the
room
a
charming
man
ejaculated
the
countess
before
the
door
was
well
closed
a
fool
corrected
catrina
i
do
not
think
you
can
say
that
dear
sighed
the
countess
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
a
clever
one
answered
catrina
there
is
a
difference
the
clever
ones
are
the
worst
the
countess
shrugged
her
shoulders
hopelessly
and
catrina
left
the
room
she
went
upstairs
to
her
own
little
den
where
the
piano
stood
it
was
the
only
room
in
the
house
that
was
not
too
warm
for
here
the
window
was
occasionally
opened
a
proceeding
which
the
countess
considered
scarcely
short
of
criminal
catrina
began
to
play
feverishly
nervously
with
all
the
weird
force
of
her
nature
she
was
like
a
very
sick
person
seeking
a
desperate
remedy
racing
against
time
it
was
her
habit
to
take
her
breaking
heart
thus
to
the
great
masters
to
interpret
their
thoughts
in
their
music
welding
their
melodies
to
the
needs
of
her
own
sorrow
she
only
had
half
an
hour
of
late
music
had
failed
her
a
little
it
had
not
given
her
the
comfort
she
had
usually
extracted
from
solitude
and
the
piano
she
was
in
a
dangerous
humor
she
was
afraid
of
trusting
herself
to
de
chauxville
the
time
fled
and
her
humor
did
not
change
she
was
still
playing
when
the
door
opened
and
the
countess
stood
before
her
flushed
and
angry
either
or
both
being
the
effect
of
stairs
upon
emotion
catrina
the
elder
lady
exclaimed
the
sleigh
is
at
the
door
and
the
count
is
waiting
i
can
not
tell
what
you
are
thinking
of
it
is
not
who
would
be
so
attentive
to
you
just
look
at
your
hair
why
ca
you
dress
like
other
girls
because
i
am
not
made
like
other
girls
replied
catrina
and
who
knows
what
bitterness
of
reproach
there
was
in
such
an
answer
from
daughter
to
mother
hush
child
replied
the
countess
whose
anger
usually
took
the
form
of
personal
abuse
you
are
as
the
good
god
made
you
then
the
good
god
must
have
made
me
in
the
dark
cried
catrina
flinging
out
of
the
room
she
will
be
down
directly
said
the
countess
lanovitch
to
de
chauxville
whom
she
found
smoking
a
cigarette
in
the
hall
she
naturally
he
he
wishes
to
make
a
careful
toilet
de
chauxville
bowed
gravely
without
committing
himself
to
any
observation
and
offered
her
a
cigarette
which
she
accepted
having
achieved
his
purpose
he
did
not
now
propose
to
convey
the
impression
that
he
admired
catrina
in
a
few
moments
the
girl
appeared
drawing
on
her
fur
gloves
before
the
door
was
opened
the
countess
discreetly
retired
to
the
enervating
warmth
of
her
own
apartments
catrina
gathered
up
the
reins
and
gave
a
little
cry
at
which
the
ponies
leaped
forward
and
in
a
whirl
of
driven
snow
the
sleigh
glided
off
between
the
pines
at
first
there
was
no
opportunity
of
conversation
for
the
ponies
were
fresh
and
troublesome
the
road
over
which
they
were
passing
had
not
been
beaten
down
by
the
passage
of
previous
sleighs
so
that
the
powdery
snow
rose
up
like
dust
and
filled
the
eyes
and
mouth
it
will
be
better
presently
gasped
catrina
wrestling
with
her
fractious
little
tartar
thoroughbreds
when
we
get
out
on
to
the
de
chauxville
sat
quite
still
if
he
felt
any
misgiving
as
to
her
power
of
mastering
her
team
he
kept
it
to
himself
there
was
a
subtle
difference
in
his
manner
toward
catrina
when
they
were
alone
together
a
suggestion
of
camaraderie
of
a
common
interest
and
a
common
desire
of
which
she
was
conscious
without
being
able
to
put
definite
meaning
to
it
it
annoyed
and
alarmed
her
while
giving
her
full
attention
to
the
management
of
the
sleigh
she
was
beginning
to
dread
the
first
words
of
this
man
who
was
merely
wielding
a
cheap
power
acquired
in
the
shady
course
of
his
career
there
is
nothing
so
disarming
as
the
assumed
air
of
intimate
knowledge
of
one
private
thoughts
and
actions
de
chauxville
assumed
this
air
with
a
skill
against
which
catrina
dogged
strength
of
character
was
incapable
of
battling
his
manner
conveyed
the
impression
that
he
knew
more
of
catrina
inward
thoughts
than
any
other
living
being
and
she
was
simple
enough
to
be
frightened
into
the
conclusion
that
she
had
betrayed
herself
to
him
there
is
no
simpler
method
of
discovering
a
secret
than
to
ignore
its
existence
it
is
possible
that
de
chauxville
became
aware
of
catrina
sidelong
glances
of
anxiety
in
his
direction
he
may
have
divined
that
silence
was
more
effective
than
speech
he
sat
looking
straight
in
front
of
him
as
if
too
deeply
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
to
take
even
a
passing
interest
in
the
scenery
why
did
you
come
here
asked
catrina
suddenly
de
chauxville
seemed
to
awake
from
a
revery
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
in
assumed
surprise
they
were
on
the
now
where
the
snow
was
beaten
down
so
conversation
was
easy
but
to
see
you
mademoiselle
i
am
not
sort
of
girl
answered
catrina
coldly
i
want
the
truth
de
chauxville
gave
a
short
laugh
and
looked
at
her
prophets
and
kings
have
sought
the
truth
mademoiselle
and
have
not
found
it
he
said
lightly
catrina
made
no
answer
to
this
her
ponies
required
considerable
attention
also
there
are
some
minds
like
large
banking
houses
not
dealing
in
small
change
that
which
passes
in
or
out
of
such
minds
has
its
own
standard
of
importance
such
people
are
not
of
much
use
in
these
days
when
we
like
to
touch
things
lightly
adorning
a
tale
but
pointing
no
moral
i
would
ask
you
to
believe
that
your
society
was
one
incentive
to
make
me
accept
the
countess
kind
hospitality
the
frenchman
observed
after
a
pause
and
de
chauxville
looked
at
her
he
had
not
met
many
women
of
solid
intellect
and
repeated
catrina
i
have
others
of
course
catrina
gave
a
little
nod
and
waited
i
wish
to
be
near
alexis
added
de
chauxville
catrina
was
staring
straight
in
front
of
her
her
face
had
acquired
a
habit
of
hardening
at
the
mention
of
paul
name
it
was
now
and
set
perhaps
she
might
have
forgiven
him
if
he
had
loved
her
once
if
only
for
a
little
while
she
might
have
forgiven
him
if
only
for
the
remembrance
of
that
little
while
but
paul
had
always
been
a
man
of
set
purpose
and
such
men
are
cruel
even
for
her
sake
even
for
the
sake
of
his
own
vanity
he
had
never
pretended
to
love
catrina
he
had
never
mistaken
gratified
vanity
for
dawning
love
as
millions
of
men
do
or
perhaps
he
was
without
vanity
some
few
men
are
so
constructed
do
you
love
him
so
asked
catrina
with
a
grim
smile
distorting
her
strong
face
as
much
as
you
mademoiselle
replied
de
chauxville
catrina
started
she
was
not
sure
that
she
hated
paul
toward
etta
there
was
no
mistake
in
her
feeling
and
this
was
so
strong
that
like
an
electric
current
there
was
enough
of
it
to
pass
through
the
wife
and
reach
the
husband
passion
like
character
does
not
grow
in
crowded
places
in
great
cities
men
are
all
more
or
less
alike
it
is
only
in
solitary
abodes
that
strong
natures
grow
up
in
their
own
way
catrina
had
grown
to
womanhood
in
one
of
the
solitary
places
of
the
earth
she
had
no
facile
axiom
no
powerful
precedent
to
guide
her
every
step
through
life
the
woman
who
was
in
daily
contact
with
her
was
immeasurably
beneath
her
in
mental
power
in
force
of
character
in
those
possibilities
of
love
or
hatred
which
go
to
make
a
strong
life
for
good
or
for
evil
by
the
side
of
her
daughter
the
countess
lanovitch
was
as
the
willow
swayed
by
every
wind
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
oak
crooked
and
still
and
strong
in
petersburg
you
pledged
yourself
to
help
me
said
de
chauxville
and
although
she
knew
that
in
the
letter
this
was
false
she
did
not
contradict
him
i
came
here
to
claim
fulfilment
of
your
promise
the
hard
blue
eyes
beneath
the
fur
cap
stared
straight
in
front
of
them
catrina
seemed
to
be
driving
like
one
asleep
for
she
noted
nothing
by
the
roadside
so
far
as
eye
could
reach
over
the
plain
through
the
silent
pines
these
two
were
alone
in
a
white
dead
world
of
their
own
catrina
never
drove
with
bells
there
was
no
sound
beyond
the
drone
of
the
steel
runners
over
the
powdery
snow
they
were
alone
unseen
unheard
save
of
that
ear
that
listens
in
the
waste
places
of
the
world
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
she
asked
oh
not
very
much
answered
de
chauxville
a
cautious
man
who
knew
a
woman
humor
catrina
driving
a
pair
of
ponies
in
the
clear
sharp
air
of
central
russia
and
catrina
playing
the
piano
in
the
enervating
atmosphere
of
a
were
two
different
women
de
chauxville
was
not
the
man
to
mistake
the
one
for
the
other
not
very
much
mademoiselle
he
answered
i
should
like
mme
la
comtesse
to
invite
the
whole
osterno
party
to
dine
and
sleep
perhaps
if
one
may
suggest
it
catrina
wanted
this
too
she
wanted
to
torture
herself
with
the
sight
of
etta
beautiful
carelessly
cognizant
of
paul
love
she
wanted
to
see
paul
look
at
his
wife
with
the
open
admiration
which
she
had
set
down
as
something
else
than
love
something
immeasurably
beneath
love
as
catrina
understood
that
passion
her
soul
brooding
under
a
weight
of
misery
was
ready
to
welcome
any
change
should
it
only
mean
a
greater
misery
i
can
manage
that
she
said
if
they
will
come
it
was
a
prearranged
matter
that
there
should
be
a
in
our
forests
that
will
do
answered
de
chauxville
reflectively
in
a
few
days
perhaps
if
it
suits
the
countess
catrina
made
no
reply
after
a
pause
she
spoke
again
in
her
strange
jerky
way
what
will
you
gain
by
it
she
asked
de
chauxville
shrugged
his
shoulders
who
knows
he
answered
there
are
many
things
i
want
to
know
many
questions
which
can
be
answered
only
by
one
own
observation
i
want
to
see
them
together
are
they
happy
catrina
face
hardened
if
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
and
he
hears
our
prayers
they
ought
not
to
be
she
replied
curtly
she
looked
happy
enough
in
petersburg
said
the
frenchman
who
never
told
the
truth
for
its
own
sake
whenever
he
thought
that
hatred
needed
stimulation
he
mentioned
etta
name
there
are
other
questions
in
my
mind
he
went
on
some
of
which
you
can
answer
mademoiselle
if
you
care
to
catrina
face
expressed
no
great
willingness
to
oblige
the
charity
league
said
de
chauxville
looking
at
her
keenly
i
have
always
had
a
feeling
of
curiosity
respecting
it
was
for
instance
our
friend
the
prince
pavlo
implicated
in
that
unfortunate
affair
catrina
flushed
suddenly
she
did
not
take
her
eyes
from
the
ponies
she
was
conscious
of
the
unwonted
color
in
her
cheeks
which
was
slowly
dying
away
beneath
her
companion
relentless
gaze
you
need
not
trouble
to
reply
mademoiselle
said
de
chauxville
with
his
dark
smile
i
am
answered
catrina
pulled
the
ponies
up
with
a
jerk
and
proceeded
to
turn
their
willing
heads
toward
home
she
was
alarmed
and
disturbed
nothing
seemed
to
be
safe
from
the
curiosity
of
this
man
no
secret
secure
no
prevarication
of
the
slightest
avail
there
are
other
questions
in
my
mind
said
de
chauxville
quietly
but
not
now
mademoiselle
is
no
doubt
tired
he
leaned
back
and
when
at
length
he
spoke
it
was
to
give
utterance
to
the
trite
commonplace
of
which
he
made
a
conversational
study
chapter
xxviii
in
the
castle
of
thors
a
week
later
catrina
watching
from
the
window
of
her
own
small
room
saw
paul
lift
etta
from
the
sleigh
and
the
sight
made
her
clench
her
hands
until
the
knuckles
shone
like
polished
ivory
she
turned
and
looked
at
herself
in
the
mirror
no
one
knew
how
she
had
tried
one
dress
after
another
since
luncheon
alone
in
her
two
rooms
having
sent
her
maid
down
stairs
no
one
knew
the
bitterness
in
this
girl
heart
as
she
contemplated
her
own
reflection
she
went
slowly
down
stairs
to
the
long
dimly
lighted
as
she
entered
she
heard
her
mother
cackling
voice
yes
princess
the
countess
was
saying
it
is
a
quaint
old
house
little
more
than
a
fortified
farm
i
know
but
my
husband
family
were
always
strange
they
seem
always
to
have
ignored
the
little
comforts
and
elegancies
of
life
it
is
most
interesting
answered
etta
voice
and
catrina
stepped
forward
into
the
light
formal
greetings
were
exchanged
and
catrina
saw
etta
look
anxiously
toward
the
door
through
which
she
had
just
come
she
thought
that
she
was
looking
for
her
husband
but
it
was
claude
de
chauxville
for
whose
appearance
etta
was
waiting
paul
and
steinmetz
entered
at
the
same
moment
by
another
door
and
catrina
who
was
talking
to
maggie
in
english
suddenly
stopped
ah
catrina
said
paul
we
have
broken
new
ground
for
you
there
was
no
track
from
here
to
osterno
through
the
forest
i
made
one
this
afternoon
so
you
have
no
excuse
for
remaining
away
now
thank
you
answered
catrina
withdrawing
her
cold
hand
hurriedly
from
his
friendly
grasp
miss
delafield
went
on
paul
admires
our
country
as
much
as
you
do
i
was
just
telling
mademoiselle
said
maggie
speaking
french
with
an
honest
english
accent
paul
nodded
and
left
them
together
yes
the
countess
was
saying
at
the
other
end
of
the
gloomy
room
yes
we
are
greatly
attached
to
thors
catrina
perhaps
more
than
i
have
some
happy
associations
and
many
sorrowful
ones
but
then
mon
dieu
how
isolated
we
are
it
is
rather
far
from
anywhere
acceded
etta
who
was
not
attending
although
she
appeared
to
be
interested
far
princess
i
often
wonder
how
paris
and
thors
can
be
in
the
same
world
before
our
our
troubles
we
used
to
live
in
paris
a
portion
of
the
year
at
least
i
did
while
my
poor
husband
travelled
about
he
had
a
hobby
you
know
poor
man
humanity
was
his
hobby
i
have
always
found
that
men
who
seek
to
do
good
to
their
fellows
are
never
thanked
have
you
noticed
that
the
human
race
is
not
grateful
en
gros
there
is
a
little
gratitude
in
the
individual
but
none
in
the
race
none
answered
etta
absently
it
was
so
with
the
charity
league
went
on
the
countess
volubly
she
paused
and
looked
round
with
her
feeble
eyes
we
are
all
friends
she
went
on
so
it
is
safe
to
mention
the
charity
league
is
it
not
no
answered
steinmetz
from
the
no
madame
there
is
only
one
friend
to
whom
you
may
safely
mention
that
ah
bad
example
exclaimed
the
countess
playfully
you
are
there
i
did
not
see
you
enter
and
who
is
that
friend
the
fair
lady
who
looks
at
you
from
your
mirror
replied
steinmetz
with
a
face
of
stone
the
countess
laughed
and
shook
her
cap
to
one
side
well
she
said
i
can
do
no
harm
in
talking
of
such
things
as
i
know
nothing
of
them
my
poor
husband
my
poor
mistaken
stépan
placed
no
confidence
in
his
wife
and
now
he
is
in
siberia
i
believe
he
works
in
a
bootmaker
shop
i
pity
the
people
who
wear
the
boots
but
perhaps
he
only
puts
in
the
laces
you
hear
paul
he
placed
no
confidence
in
his
wife
and
now
he
is
in
siberia
let
that
be
a
warning
to
you
eh
princess
i
hope
he
tells
you
everything
put
not
your
trust
in
princesses
said
steinmetz
from
the
where
he
was
still
warming
his
hands
for
he
had
driven
maggie
over
it
says
so
in
the
bible
princes
profane
one
exclaimed
the
countess
with
a
laugh
princes
not
princesses
it
may
be
so
i
bow
to
your
superior
literary
attainments
replied
steinmetz
looking
casually
and
significantly
at
a
pile
of
foreign
novels
on
a
no
the
countess
went
on
addressing
her
conversation
to
etta
no
my
husband
figure
to
yourself
princess
told
me
nothing
i
never
knew
that
he
was
implicated
in
this
great
scheme
i
do
not
know
now
who
else
was
concerned
in
it
it
was
all
so
sudden
so
unexpected
so
terrible
it
appears
that
he
kept
the
papers
in
this
very
house
in
that
room
through
there
it
was
his
study
my
dear
countess
silence
interrupted
steinmetz
at
this
moment
breaking
into
the
conversation
in
his
masterful
way
and
enabling
etta
to
get
away
catrina
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
was
listening
breathless
it
was
the
sight
of
catrina
face
that
made
steinmetz
go
forward
he
had
not
been
looking
at
catrina
but
at
etta
who
was
perfect
in
her
composure
and
steady
do
you
want
to
enter
the
boot
trade
also
asked
steinmetz
cheerfully
in
a
lowered
voice
heaven
forbid
cried
the
countess
then
let
us
talk
of
safer
things
the
short
twilight
was
already
brooding
over
the
land
the
room
lighted
only
by
small
square
windows
grew
darker
and
darker
until
catrina
rang
for
lamps
i
hate
a
dark
room
she
said
shortly
to
maggie
when
de
chauxville
came
in
a
few
minutes
later
catrina
was
at
the
piano
the
room
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
on
the
table
gleamed
and
glittered
the
silver
the
intermediate
meal
had
been
disposed
of
but
the
samovar
had
been
left
alight
as
is
the
habit
at
russian
afternoon
teas
catrina
looked
up
when
the
frenchman
entered
but
did
not
cease
playing
there
is
no
need
for
introductions
i
think
said
the
countess
we
all
know
de
chauxville
replied
paul
quietly
and
the
two
men
exchanged
a
glance
de
chauxville
shook
hands
with
the
and
while
the
countess
prepared
tea
for
him
launched
into
a
long
description
of
the
preparations
for
the
of
the
following
day
he
addressed
his
remarks
exclusively
to
paul
as
between
enthusiasts
and
gradually
paul
thawed
a
little
and
made
one
or
two
suggestions
which
betrayed
a
deep
knowledge
and
a
dawning
interest
we
shall
only
be
three
rifles
said
de
chauxville
steinmetz
you
and
i
and
i
must
ask
you
to
bear
in
mind
the
fact
that
i
am
no
shot
a
mere
amateur
my
dear
prince
the
countess
has
been
good
enough
to
leave
the
whole
matter
in
my
hands
i
have
seen
the
keepers
and
i
have
arranged
that
they
come
at
eleven
to
see
us
and
to
report
progress
they
know
of
three
bears
and
are
attempting
to
ring
them
the
frenchman
was
really
full
of
information
and
enthusiasm
there
were
many
details
upon
which
he
required
paul
advice
and
the
two
men
talked
together
with
less
constraint
than
they
had
hitherto
done
de
chauxville
had
picked
up
a
vast
deal
of
technical
matter
and
handled
his
little
knowledge
with
a
skill
which
bade
fair
to
deprive
it
of
its
proverbial
danger
he
presently
left
steinmetz
and
the
prince
engaged
in
a
controversy
with
the
countess
as
to
a
at
the
maggie
and
catrina
were
at
the
piano
etta
was
looking
at
a
book
of
photographs
a
charming
house
princess
said
de
chauxville
in
a
voice
that
all
could
hear
while
the
music
happened
to
be
soft
but
catrina
music
was
more
remarkable
for
strength
than
for
softness
charming
replied
etta
the
music
rose
into
a
swelling
burst
of
harmonious
chords
i
must
see
you
princess
said
de
chauxville
etta
glanced
across
the
room
toward
her
husband
and
steinmetz
alone
added
the
frenchman
coolly
etta
turned
a
page
of
the
album
and
looked
critically
into
a
photograph
must
she
said
with
a
little
frown
must
repeated
de
chauxville
a
word
i
do
not
care
about
said
etta
with
raised
eyebrows
the
music
was
soft
again
it
is
ten
years
since
i
held
a
rifle
said
de
chauxville
ah
madame
you
do
not
know
the
excitement
i
pity
ladies
for
they
have
no
sport
no
big
game
personally
monsieur
answered
etta
with
a
bright
laugh
i
do
not
grudge
you
your
big
game
suppose
you
miss
the
bear
or
whatever
it
may
be
then
said
de
chauxville
with
a
brave
shrug
of
the
shoulders
it
is
the
turn
of
the
bear
the
excitement
is
his
the
laugh
is
with
him
catrina
foot
was
upon
the
loud
pedal
again
nevertheless
madame
said
de
chauxville
i
make
so
bold
as
to
use
the
word
you
perhaps
know
me
well
enough
to
be
aware
that
i
am
rarely
bold
unless
my
ground
is
sure
i
should
not
boast
of
it
answered
etta
there
is
nothing
to
be
proud
of
it
is
easy
enough
to
be
bold
if
you
are
certain
of
victory
when
defeat
would
be
intolerable
even
a
certain
victory
requires
care
and
i
can
not
afford
to
lose
lose
what
enquired
etta
de
chauxville
looked
at
her
but
he
did
not
answer
the
music
was
soft
again
i
suppose
that
at
osterno
you
set
no
value
upon
a
he
said
after
a
pause
we
have
many
admitted
etta
but
i
love
fur
or
trophies
of
any
description
paul
has
killed
a
great
deal
ah
yes
answered
etta
and
the
music
rose
again
i
should
like
to
know
she
went
on
upon
what
assumption
you
make
use
of
a
word
which
does
not
often
annoy
me
i
have
a
good
memory
madame
besides
he
paused
looking
round
the
room
there
are
associations
within
these
walls
which
stimulate
the
memory
what
do
you
mean
asked
etta
in
a
hard
voice
the
hand
holding
the
album
suddenly
shook
like
a
leaf
in
the
wind
de
chauxville
had
stood
upright
his
hand
at
his
mustache
after
the
manner
of
a
man
whose
is
exhausted
it
would
appear
that
he
was
wondering
how
he
could
gracefully
get
away
from
the
princess
to
pay
his
devoirs
elsewhere
i
can
not
tell
you
now
he
answered
catrina
is
watching
us
across
the
piano
you
must
beware
madame
of
those
cold
blue
eyes
he
moved
away
going
toward
the
piano
where
maggie
was
standing
behind
catrina
chair
he
was
like
a
woman
inasmuch
as
he
could
not
keep
away
from
his
failures
are
you
advanced
miss
delafield
he
asked
with
his
deferential
little
bow
are
you
modern
i
am
neither
i
have
no
desire
for
even
the
cheapest
form
of
notoriety
why
do
you
ask
replied
maggie
i
was
merely
wondering
whether
we
were
to
count
you
among
our
rifles
one
never
knows
what
ladies
will
do
next
not
ladies
i
apologize
women
i
suppose
it
is
those
who
are
not
by
birth
ladies
who
aspire
to
the
proud
name
of
women
the
modern
woman
with
a
capital
w
is
not
a
lady
ce
pas
she
does
not
mind
your
abuse
monsieur
laughed
maggie
so
long
as
you
do
not
ignore
her
she
is
happy
but
you
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
as
regards
i
have
never
let
off
a
gun
in
my
life
and
i
am
sensible
enough
not
to
begin
on
bears
de
chauxville
made
a
suitable
reply
and
remained
by
the
piano
talking
to
the
two
young
ladies
until
etta
rose
and
came
toward
them
he
then
crossed
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
engaged
paul
in
the
discussion
of
further
plans
for
the
morrow
it
was
soon
time
to
dress
for
dinner
and
etta
was
forced
to
forego
the
opportunity
she
sought
to
exchange
a
word
alone
with
de
chauxville
that
astute
gentleman
carefully
avoided
allowing
her
this
opportunity
he
knew
the
value
of
a
little
suspense
during
dinner
and
afterward
when
at
length
the
gentlemen
came
to
the
the
conversation
was
of
a
sporting
tendency
bears
and
bear
stories
held
supreme
sway
more
than
once
de
chauxvilie
returned
to
this
subject
twice
he
avoided
etta
in
some
ways
this
man
was
courageous
he
delayed
giving
etta
her
opportunity
until
there
was
a
question
of
retiring
to
bed
in
view
of
the
early
start
required
by
the
next
day
arrangements
it
had
been
finally
settled
that
the
three
younger
ladies
should
drive
over
to
a
cottage
at
the
far
end
of
the
forest
where
luncheon
was
to
be
served
while
this
item
of
the
programme
was
arranged
de
chauxville
looked
straight
at
etta
across
the
table
at
length
she
had
the
chance
afforded
to
her
deliberately
by
de
chauxville
what
did
you
mean
she
asked
at
once
i
have
received
information
which
had
i
known
it
three
months
ago
would
have
made
a
difference
in
your
life
what
difference
i
should
have
been
your
husband
instead
of
that
giant
etta
laughed
but
her
lips
were
for
the
moment
colorless
when
am
i
to
see
you
alone
etta
shrugged
her
shoulders
she
had
plenty
of
spirit
please
do
not
be
dramatic
or
mysterious
i
am
tired
she
rose
and
concealed
a
simulated
yawn
de
chauxville
looked
at
her
with
his
sinister
smile
and
etta
suddenly
saw
the
resemblance
which
paul
had
noted
between
this
man
and
the
grinning
mask
of
the
lynx
in
the
at
osterno
when
repeated
he
etta
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
about
the
charity
league
said
de
chauxville
etta
eyes
dilated
she
made
a
step
or
two
away
from
him
but
she
came
back
i
shall
not
go
to
the
luncheon
if
you
care
to
leave
the
hunt
early
de

bowed
chapter
xxix
at
bedtime
catrina
went
to
maggie
room
with
her
to
see
that
she
had
all
that
she
could
desire
a
wood
fire
was
burning
brightly
in
the
open
french
stove
the
room
was
lighted
by
lamps
it
was
warm
and
cheery
a
second
door
led
to
the
little
which
catrina
had
made
her
own
and
beyond
was
her
bedroom
maggie
had
assured
her
hostess
that
she
had
every
thing
that
she
could
wish
and
that
she
did
not
desire
the
services
of
catrina
maid
but
the
russian
girl
still
lingered
she
was
slow
to
make
friends
not
shy
but
diffident
and
suspicious
her
friendship
once
secured
was
a
thing
worth
possessing
she
was
inclined
to
bestow
it
upon
this
quiet
english
girl
in
such
matters
the
length
of
an
acquaintance
goes
for
nothing
a
long
acquaintanceship
does
not
necessarily
mean
friendship
one
being
the
result
of
circumstance
the
other
of
selection
the
princess
knows
russian
said
catrina
suddenly
she
was
standing
near
the
where
she
had
been
absently
attending
to
the
candles
she
wheeled
round
and
looked
at
maggie
who
was
hospitably
sitting
on
a
low
chair
near
the
fire
she
was
sorry
for
the
loneliness
of
this
girl
life
she
did
not
want
her
to
go
away
just
yet
there
was
another
chair
by
the
fire
inviting
catrina
to
indulge
in
those
maiden
confidences
which
attach
themselves
to
slippers
and
maggie
looked
up
with
a
smile
which
slowly
ebbed
away
catrina
remark
was
of
the
nature
of
a
defiance
her
rôle
of
hostess
was
suddenly
laid
aside
no
she
does
not
answered
the
english
girl
catrina
came
forward
standing
over
maggie
looking
down
at
her
with
eyes
full
of
antagonism
excuse
me
i
saw
her
understand
a
remark
i
made
to
one
of
the
servants
she
was
not
careful
i
saw
it
distinctly
i
think
you
must
be
mistaken
answered
maggie
quietly
she
has
been
in
russia
before
for
a
few
weeks
but
she
did
not
learn
the
language
she
told
me
so
herself
why
should
she
pretend
not
to
know
russian
if
she
does
catrina
made
no
answer
she
sat
heavily
down
in
the
vacant
chair
her
attitudes
were
uncouth
and
strong
a
perpetual
source
of
tribulation
to
the
countess
she
sat
with
her
elbow
on
her
knee
staring
into
the
fire
i
did
not
mean
to
hate
her
i
did
not
want
to
she
said
if
it
had
been
you
i
should
not
have
hated
you
maggie
clear
eyes
wavered
for
a
moment
a
faint
color
rose
to
her
face
she
leaned
back
so
that
the
firelight
did
not
reach
her
there
was
a
silence
during
which
maggie
unclasped
a
bracelet
with
a
little
snap
of
the
spring
catrina
did
not
hear
the
sound
she
heard
nothing
she
did
not
appear
to
be
aware
of
her
surroundings
maggie
unclasped
another
bracelet
noisily
she
was
probably
regretting
her
former
kindness
of
manner
catrina
had
come
too
near
are
you
not
judging
rather
hastily
suggested
maggie
in
a
measured
voice
which
heightened
the
contrast
between
the
two
i
find
it
takes
some
time
to
discover
whether
one
likes
or
dislikes
new
acquaintances
yes
but
you
english
are
so
cold
and
deliberate
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
hate
or
to
care
perhaps
we
do
said
maggie
but
we
say
less
about
it
catrina
turned
and
looked
at
her
with
a
queer
smile
less
she
laughed
nothing
you
say
nothing
paul
is
the
same
i
have
seen
i
know
you
have
said
nothing
since
you
came
to
thors
you
have
talked
and
laughed
you
have
given
opinions
you
have
spoken
of
many
things
but
you
have
said
nothing
you
are
the
same
as
paul
one
never
knows
i
know
nothing
about
you
but
i
like
you
you
are
her
cousin
yes
and
i
hate
her
maggie
laughed
she
was
quite
steady
and
loyal
when
you
get
to
know
her
you
will
change
perhaps
she
said
perhaps
i
know
her
now
better
than
you
do
maggie
laughed
in
her
cheery
practical
way
that
seems
hardly
likely
considering
that
i
have
known
her
since
we
were
children
catrina
shrugged
her
shoulders
in
an
honest
if
somewhat
mannerless
refusal
to
discuss
the
side
issue
she
returned
to
the
main
question
with
characteristic
stubbornness
i
shall
always
hate
her
she
said
i
am
sorry
she
is
your
cousin
i
shall
always
regret
that
and
i
shall
always
hate
her
there
is
something
wrong
about
her
something
none
of
you
know
except
karl
steinmetz
he
knows
every
thing
herr
steinmetz
he
knows
a
great
deal
admitted
maggie
yes
and
that
is
why
he
is
sad
is
it
not
so
catrina
sat
staring
into
the
fire
her
strange
earnest
eyes
almost
fierce
in
their
concentration
did
she
pretend
that
she
loved
him
at
first
she
asked
suddenly
receiving
no
answer
she
looked
up
and
fixed
her
searching
gaze
on
the
face
of
her
companion
maggie
was
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
in
the
direction
of
the
fire
but
not
with
eyes
focussed
to
see
any
thing
so
near
at
hand
she
bore
the
scrutiny
without
flinching
as
soon
as
catrina
eyes
were
averted
the
stillness
of
her
features
relaxed
she
does
not
take
that
trouble
now
added
the
russian
girl
in
reply
to
her
own
question
did
you
see
her
when
we
were
at
the
piano
de
chauxville
was
talking
to
her
they
were
keeping
two
conversations
going
at
the
same
time
i
could
see
by
their
faces
they
said
different
things
when
the
music
was
loud
i
hate
her
she
is
not
true
to
paul
de
chauxville
knows
something
about
her
they
have
something
in
common
which
is
not
known
to
paul
or
to
any
of
us
why
do
you
not
speak
why
do
you
sit
staring
into
the
fire
with
your
lips
so
close
together
because
i
do
not
think
that
we
shall
gain
any
thing
by
discussing
paul
and
his
wife
it
is
no
business
of
ours
catrina
laughed
a
lamentable
mirthless
laugh
that
is
because
she
is
your
cousin
and
he
he
is
nothing
to
you
you
do
not
care
whether
he
is
happy
or
not
catrina
had
turned
upon
her
companion
fiercely
maggie
swung
round
in
her
chair
to
pick
up
her
bracelets
which
had
slipped
from
her
knees
to
the
floor
you
exaggerate
things
she
said
quietly
i
see
no
reason
to
suppose
that
paul
is
unhappy
it
is
because
you
have
taken
this
unreasoning
dislike
to
her
she
took
a
long
time
to
collect
three
bracelets
then
she
rose
and
placed
them
on
the
do
you
want
me
to
go
asked
catrina
in
her
blunt
way
no
answered
maggie
civilly
enough
but
she
extracted
a
couple
of
rather
obviously
catrina
heeded
the
voice
and
not
the
action
you
english
are
all
alike
she
said
you
hold
one
at
arm
length
i
suppose
there
is
some
one
in
england
for
whom
you
care
who
is
out
of
all
this
away
from
all
the
troubles
of
russia
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
life
it
is
only
a
passing
incident
a
few
weeks
to
be
forgotten
when
you
go
back
i
wonder
what
he
is
like
the
man
in
england
you
need
not
tell
me
i
am
not
curious
in
that
way
i
am
not
asking
you
to
tell
me
i
am
just
wondering
for
i
know
there
is
some
one
i
knew
it
when
i
first
saw
you
you
are
so
quiet
and
settled
and
like
a
person
who
has
played
a
game
and
knows
for
certain
that
it
is
lost
or
won
and
does
not
want
to
play
again
your
hair
is
very
pretty
you
are
very
pretty
you
quiet
english
girl
i
wonder
what
you
think
about
behind
your
steady
eyes
i
said
maggie
with
a
little
laugh
oh
i
think
about
my
dresses
and
the
new
fashions
and
parties
and
all
the
things
that
girls
do
think
of
catrina
shook
her
head
she
looked
stubborn
and
unconvinced
then
suddenly
she
changed
the
conversation
do
you
like
de
chauxville
she
asked
no
does
paul
like
him
i
do
know
catrina
looked
up
for
a
moment
only
then
her
eyes
returned
to
the
contemplation
of
the
burning
i
wonder
why
you
will
not
talk
of
paul
she
said
in
a
voice
requiring
no
answer
maggie
moved
rather
uneasily
she
had
her
back
turned
toward
catrina
i
am
afraid
i
am
rather
a
dull
person
she
answered
i
have
not
much
to
say
about
any
body
and
nothing
about
paul
suggested
catrina
nothing
we
were
talking
of
de
chauxville
yes
i
do
not
understand
de
chauxville
he
seems
to
me
to
be
the
incarnation
of
insincerity
he
poses
even
to
himself
he
is
always
watching
for
the
effect
i
wonder
what
the
effect
of
himself
upon
himself
may
be
maggie
laughed
that
is
rather
complicated
she
said
it
requires
working
out
i
think
he
is
deeply
impressed
with
his
own
astuteness
if
he
were
simpler
he
would
be
cleverer
catrina
was
afraid
of
claude
de
chauxville
and
because
this
was
so
she
stared
in
wonder
at
the
english
girl
who
dismissed
him
from
the
conversation
and
her
thoughts
with
a
few
careless
words
of
contempt
such
minds
as
that
of
miss
delafield
were
quite
outside
the
field
of
de
chauxville
influence
while
that
frenchman
had
considerable
power
over
highly
strung
and
imaginative
natures
catrina
lanovitch
had
begun
by
tolerating
him
had
proceeded
to
make
the
serious
blunder
of
permitting
him
to
be
impertinently
familiar
and
was
now
exaggerating
in
her
own
mind
the
hold
that
he
had
over
her
she
did
not
actually
dislike
him
so
few
people
had
taken
the
trouble
or
found
the
expediency
of
endeavoring
to
sympathize
with
her
or
understand
her
nature
that
she
was
unconsciously
drawn
toward
this
man
whom
she
now
feared
in
exaggerating
the
power
he
exercised
over
herself
she
somewhat
naturally
exaggerated
also
his
importance
in
the
world
and
in
the
lives
of
those
around
him
she
had
imagined
him
and
the
first
person
to
whom
she
mentioned
his
name
dismissed
the
subject
indifferently
her
own
entire
sincerity
had
enabled
her
to
detect
the
insincerity
of
her
ally
she
had
purposely
made
mention
of
the
weak
spot
which
she
had
discovered
in
order
that
her
observation
might
be
corroborated
and
this
maggie
had
failed
to
do
with
the
slightest
encouragement
catrina
would
have
told
her
companion
all
that
had
passed
the
sympathy
between
women
is
so
strong
that
there
is
usually
only
one
man
who
is
safe
from
discussion
in
catrina
case
that
one
man
was
not
claude
de
chauxville
but
maggie
delafield
was
of
different
material
from
this
impressionable
impulsive
russian
girl
she
was
essentially
british
in
her
capacity
for
steering
a
straight
personal
course
through
the
shoals
and
quicksands
of
her
neighbors
affairs
as
also
in
the
firm
grip
she
held
upon
her
own
thoughts
she
was
by
no
means
prepared
to
open
her
mind
to
the
first
comer
and
in
her
somewhat
english
estimate
of
such
matters
catrina
was
as
yet
little
more
than
the
first
comer
she
changed
the
subject
and
they
talked
for
some
time
on
indifferent
topics
such
topics
as
have
an
interest
for
girls
and
who
are
we
that
we
may
despise
them
we
jeer
very
grandly
at
girls
talk
and
promptly
return
to
the
discussion
of
our
dogs
and
pipes
and
clothing
but
catrina
was
not
happy
under
this
judicious
treatment
she
had
no
one
in
the
world
to
whom
she
could
impart
a
thousand
doubts
and
questions
a
hundred
grievances
and
one
great
grief
and
it
was
just
this
one
great
grief
of
which
maggie
dreaded
the
mention
she
was
quite
well
aware
of
its
existence
had
been
aware
of
it
for
some
time
karl
steinmetz
had
thrown
out
one
or
two
vague
hints
everything
pointed
to
it
maggie
could
hardly
be
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
catrina
had
grown
to
womanhood
loving
paul
a
score
of
times
catrina
approached
the
subject
and
with
imperturbable
steadfastness
maggie
held
to
her
determination
that
paul
was
not
to
be
discussed
by
them
she
warded
she
evaded
she
ignored
with
a
skill
which
baffled
the
simple
russian
she
had
a
hundred
subterfuges
a
hundred
skilful
turns
and
twists
where
women
learn
these
matters
heaven
only
knows
all
our
experience
of
the
world
our
falls
and
stumbles
on
the
broken
road
of
life
never
teach
us
some
things
that
are
known
to
the
veriest
schoolgirl
standing
on
the
smoother
footpath
that
women
tread
at
last
catrina
rose
to
go
maggie
rose
also
women
are
relentless
where
they
fight
for
their
own
secrets
maggie
morally
turned
catrina
out
of
the
room
the
two
girls
stood
looking
at
each
other
for
a
moment
they
had
nothing
in
common
the
language
in
which
they
understood
each
other
best
was
the
native
tongue
of
neither
born
in
different
countries
each
of
a
mixed
race
with
no
one
racial
strain
in
common
neither
creed
nor
education
nor
similarity
of
thought
had
aught
to
draw
them
together
they
looked
at
each
other
and
god
hand
touched
them
they
both
loved
the
same
man
they
did
not
hate
each
other
have
you
every
thing
you
want
asked
catrina
the
question
was
startling
catrina
speech
was
ever
abrupt
at
first
maggie
did
not
understand
yes
thanks
she
answered
i
am
very
tired
i
suppose
it
is
the
snow
yes
said
catrina
mechanically
it
is
the
snow
she
went
toward
the
door
and
there
she
paused
does
paul
love
her
she
asked
abruptly
maggie
made
no
answer
and
as
was
her
habit
catrina
replied
to
her
own
question
you
know
he
does
not
you
know
he
does
not
she
said
then
she
went
out
without
waiting
for
an
answer
closing
the
door
behind
her
the
closed
door
heard
the
reply
it
will
not
matter
much
said
maggie
so
long
as
he
never
finds
it
out
chapter
xxx
wolf
the
countess
lanovitch
never
quitted
her
own
apartments
before
she
had
acquired
a
parisian
habit
of
being
invisible
until
the
two
girls
left
the
castle
of
thors
in
a
sleigh
with
one
attendant
at
ten
in
order
to
reach
the
hut
selected
for
luncheon
by
etta
did
not
accompany
them
she
had
a
slight
headache
at
eleven
claude
de
chauxville
returned
alone
on
horseback
after
the
sportsmen
had
separated
each
to
gain
his
prearranged
position
in
the
forest
he
had
tripped
over
his
rifle
seriously
injuring
the
delicate
sighting
mechanism
he
found
he
told
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
for
him
that
he
had
just
time
to
return
for
another
rifle
before
the
operation
of
closing
in
on
the
bears
was
to
begin
if
madame
the
princess
was
visible
he
went
on
would
the
servant
tell
her
that
de
chauxville
was
waiting
in
the
library
to
assure
her
that
there
was
absolutely
no
danger
to
be
anticipated
in
the
sport
the
princess
it
would
appear
was
absurdly
anxious
about
the
welfare
of
her
husband
an
experienced
hunter
and
a
dead
shot
claude
de
chauxville
then
went
to
the
library
where
he
waited
booted
spurred
rifle
in
hand
for
etta
after
a
lapse
of
five
minutes
or
more
the
door
was
opened
and
etta
came
leisurely
into
the
room
well
she
enquired
indifferently
de
chauxville
bowed
he
walked
past
her
and
closed
the
door
which
she
happened
to
have
left
open
then
he
returned
and
stood
by
the
window
leaning
gracefully
on
his
rifle
his
attitude
his
his
great
made
rather
a
picturesque
object
of
him
well
repeated
etta
almost
insolently
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
have
married
me
said
de
chauxville
darkly
etta
shrugged
her
shoulders
because
i
understand
you
better
i
you
better
than
your
husband
etta
turned
and
glanced
at
the
clock
have
you
come
back
from
the
to
tell
me
this
or
to
avoid
the
bears
she
asked
de
chauxville
frowned
a
man
who
has
tasted
fear
does
not
like
a
question
of
his
courage
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
and
other
things
he
answered
he
looked
at
her
with
his
sinister
smile
and
a
little
upward
jerk
of
the
head
he
extended
his
open
hand
palm
upward
with
the
fingers
slightly
crooked
i
hold
you
madame
he
said
i
hold
you
in
my
hand
you
are
my
slave
despite
your
brave
title
my
thing
my
plaything
despite
your
servants
and
your
great
houses
and
your
husband
when
i
have
finished
telling
you
all
that
i
have
to
tell
you
will
understand
you
will
perhaps
thank
me
for
being
merciful
etta
laughed
defiantly
you
are
afraid
of
paul
she
cried
you
are
afraid
of
karl
steinmetz
you
will
presently
be
afraid
of
me
i
think
not
said
de
chauxville
coolly
the
two
names
just
mentioned
were
certainly
not
of
pleasant
import
in
his
ears
but
he
was
not
going
to
let
a
woman
know
that
this
man
had
played
dangerous
cards
before
now
he
was
not
at
all
sure
of
his
ground
he
did
not
know
what
position
was
in
regard
to
steinmetz
behind
the
defiant
woman
there
lurked
the
broad
shadow
of
the
man
who
never
defied
who
knew
many
things
but
was
ignorant
of
fear
unlike
karl
steinmetz
de
chauxville
was
not
a
bold
player
he
liked
to
be
sure
of
his
trick
before
he
threw
down
his
trump
card
his
method
was
not
above
suspicion
he
liked
to
know
what
cards
his
adversary
held
and
one
may
be
sure
that
he
was
not
above
peeping
karl
steinmetz
is
no
friend
of
yours
he
said
etta
did
not
answer
she
was
thinking
of
the
conversation
she
had
had
with
steinmetz
in
petersburg
she
was
wondering
whether
the
friendship
he
had
offered
the
solid
thing
as
he
called
it
was
not
better
than
the
love
of
this
man
i
have
information
now
went
on
de
chauxville
which
would
have
made
you
my
wife
had
i
had
it
sooner
i
think
not
said
the
lady
insolently
she
had
dealt
with
such
men
before
hers
was
the
beauty
that
appealed
to
de
chauxville
and
such
as
he
it
is
not
the
beautiful
women
who
see
the
best
side
of
human
nature
even
now
went
on
the
frenchman
now
that
i
know
you
i
still
love
you
you
are
the
only
woman
i
shall
ever
love
indeed
murmured
the
lady
quite
unmoved
yes
although
in
a
way
i
despise
you
now
that
i
know
you
mon
dieu
exclaimed
etta
if
you
have
any
thing
to
say
please
say
it
i
have
no
time
to
probe
your
mysteries
to
discover
your
parables
you
know
me
well
enough
perhaps
to
be
aware
that
i
am
not
to
be
frightened
by
your
cheap
charlatanism
i
know
you
well
enough
retorted
de
chauxville
hoarsely
to
be
aware
that
it
was
you
who
sold
the
charity
league
papers
to
vassili
in
paris
i
know
you
well
enough
madame
to
be
aware
of
your
present
position
in
regard
to
your
husband
if
i
say
a
word
in
the
right
quarter
you
would
never
leave
russia
alive
i
have
merely
to
say
to
catrina
lanovitch
that
it
was
you
who
banished
her
father
for
your
own
gain
i
have
merely
to
hand
your
name
in
to
certain
of
the
charity
league
party
and
even
your
husband
could
not
save
you
he
had
gradually
approached
her
and
uttered
the
last
words
face
to
face
his
eyes
close
to
hers
she
held
her
head
up
erect
defiant
still
so
you
see
madame
he
said
you
belong
to
me
she
smiled
hand
and
foot
he
added
but
i
am
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
away
what
will
you
he
said
looking
out
of
the
window
i
love
you
nonsense
he
turned
slowly
round
what
nonsense
repeated
etta
you
love
power
you
are
a
bully
you
love
to
please
your
own
vanity
by
thinking
that
you
have
me
in
your
power
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
de
chauxville
leaned
gracefully
against
the
window
he
still
held
his
rifle
reflect
a
little
he
said
with
his
cold
smile
it
would
appear
that
you
do
not
quite
realize
the
situation
women
rarely
realize
situations
in
time
our
friend
your
husband
has
many
of
the
english
idiosyncrasies
he
has
all
the
notions
of
honor
which
obtain
in
that
country
added
to
this
i
suspect
him
of
possessing
a
truly
slavonic
fire
which
he
keeps
under
smouldering
fire
you
know
madame
our
french
proverb
he
is
not
the
man
to
take
a
rational
and
view
of
your
little
transaction
with
vassili
more
especially
perhaps
as
it
banished
his
friend
stépan
lanovitch
the
owner
of
this
house
by
the
way
his
reception
of
the
news
i
have
to
tell
him
would
be
unpleasant
for
you
what
do
you
want
interrupted
etta
money
i
am
not
a
needy
adventurer
and
i
am
not
such
a
fool
de
chauxville
as
to
allow
myself
to
be
dragged
into
a
vulgar
intrigue
borrowed
from
a
french
novel
to
satisfy
your
vanity
de
chauxville
dull
eyes
suddenly
flashed
i
will
trouble
you
to
believe
madame
he
said
in
a
low
concentrated
voice
that
such
a
thought
never
entered
my
head
a
de
chauxville
is
not
a
commercial
traveller
if
you
please
no
it
may
surprise
you
but
my
feeling
for
you
has
more
good
in
it
than
you
would
seem
capable
of
inspiring
god
only
knows
how
it
is
that
a
bad
woman
can
inspire
a
good
love
etta
looked
at
him
in
amazement
she
did
not
always
understand
de
chauxville
no
matter
for
surprise
perhaps
for
he
did
not
always
understand
himself
then
what
do
you
want
she
asked
in
the
meantime
implicit
obedience
what
are
you
going
to
use
me
for
i
have
ends
replied
claude
de
chauxville
who
had
regained
his
usual
composure
that
you
will
serve
but
they
will
be
your
ends
as
well
as
mine
you
will
profit
by
them
i
will
take
very
good
care
that
you
come
to
no
harm
for
you
are
the
ultimate
object
of
all
this
at
the
end
of
it
all
i
see
only
you
etta
shrugged
her
shoulders
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
she
was
absolutely
heartless
many
women
are
it
is
when
a
heartless
woman
has
brains
that
one
hears
of
her
what
if
i
refuse
asked
etta
keenly
aware
of
the
fact
that
this
man
was
handicapped
by
his
love
for
her
then
i
will
force
you
to
obedience
etta
raised
her
delicate
eyebrows
insolently
ah
yes
said
de
chauxville
with
suppressed
anger
i
will
force
you
to
obey
me
the
princess
looked
at
him
with
her
little
mocking
smile
she
raised
one
hand
to
her
head
with
a
reflective
air
as
if
a
were
of
greater
importance
than
his
words
she
had
dressed
herself
rather
carefully
for
this
interview
she
never
for
a
moment
overlooked
the
fact
that
she
was
a
woman
and
beautiful
she
did
not
allow
him
to
forget
it
either
her
mood
of
outraged
virtue
was
now
suddenly
thrown
into
the
background
by
a
phase
of
open
coquetry
beneath
her
eyelids
she
watched
for
the
effect
of
her
pretty
provoking
attitude
on
the
man
who
loved
her
she
was
on
her
own
territory
at
this
work
playing
her
own
game
and
she
was
more
alarmed
by
de
chauxville
imperturbability
than
by
any
thing
he
had
said
you
have
a
strange
way
of
proving
the
truth
of
your
own
statements
what
statements
she
gave
a
little
laugh
her
attitude
her
glance
the
cunning
display
of
a
perfect
figure
the
laugh
the
whole
woman
was
the
incarnation
of
practised
coquetry
she
did
not
admit
even
to
herself
that
she
was
afraid
of
de
chauxville
but
she
was
playing
her
best
cards
in
her
best
manner
she
had
never
known
them
fail
claude
de
chauxville
was
a
little
white
about
the
lips
his
eyelids
flickered
but
by
an
effort
he
controlled
himself
and
she
did
not
see
the
light
in
his
eyes
for
which
she
looked
if
you
mean
he
said
coldly
the
statement
that
i
made
to
you
before
you
were
married
namely
that
i
love
you
i
am
quite
content
to
leave
the
proof
till
the
future
i
know
what
i
am
about
madame
he
took
his
watch
from
his
pocket
and
consulted
it
i
must
go
in
five
minutes
he
said
i
have
a
few
instructions
to
give
you
to
which
i
must
beg
your
careful
attention
he
looked
up
meeting
etta
somewhat
sullen
gaze
with
a
smile
of
triumph
it
is
essential
he
went
on
that
i
be
invited
to
osterno
i
do
not
want
to
stay
there
long
indeed
i
do
not
care
to
but
i
must
see
the
place
i
dare
say
you
can
compass
the
invitation
madame
it
will
be
difficult
and
therefore
worthy
of
your
endeavor
i
have
the
greatest
regard
for
your
diplomatic
skill
i
leave
the
matter
in
your
hands
princess
etta
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
looked
past
him
out
of
the
window
de
chauxville
was
considering
her
face
carefully
another
point
to
be
remembered
he
went
on
is
your
husband
daily
life
at
osterno
the
prince
is
not
above
suspicion
the
authorities
are
watching
him
he
is
suspected
of
propagating
revolutionary
ideas
among
the
peasantry
i
should
like
you
to
find
out
as
much
as
you
can
perhaps
you
know
already
perhaps
he
has
told
you
princess
i
know
that
beautiful
face
he
has
told
you
good
does
he
take
an
interest
in
the
peasants
etta
did
not
answer
kindly
give
me
your
attention
madame
does
the
prince
take
an
interest
in
the
peasants
yes
an
active
interest
yes
have
you
any
details
no
answered
etta
then
you
will
watch
him
and
procure
those
details
etta
face
was
defiant
and
pale
de
chauxville
never
took
his
eyes
from
it
i
have
undertaken
a
few
small
commissions
for
an
old
friend
of
yours
vassili
whom
you
obliged
once
before
he
said
and
the
defiance
faded
from
her
eyes
the
authorities
can
not
in
these
disturbed
times
afford
to
tolerate
princes
of
an
independent
turn
of
mind
such
men
are
apt
to
make
the
peasant
think
himself
more
important
than
he
is
i
dare
say
madame
that
you
are
already
tired
of
russia
it
might
perhaps
serve
your
ends
if
this
country
was
made
a
little
too
hot
for
your
husband
eh
i
see
your
proud
lips
quivering
princess
it
is
well
to
keep
the
lips
under
control
we
who
deal
in
diplomacy
know
where
to
look
for
such
signs
yes
i
dare
say
i
can
get
you
out
of
russia
for
ever
but
you
must
be
obedient
you
must
reconcile
yourself
to
the
knowledge
that
you
have
met
your
master
he
bowed
in
his
graceful
way
spreading
out
his
hands
in
mock
humility
etta
did
not
answer
him
for
the
moment
she
could
see
no
outlet
to
this
maze
of
trouble
and
yet
she
was
conscious
of
not
fearing
de
chauxville
so
much
as
she
feared
karl
steinmetz
a
lenient
master
pursued
the
frenchman
whose
vanity
was
tickled
by
the
word
i
do
not
ask
much
one
thing
is
to
be
invited
to
osterno
that
i
may
be
near
you
the
other
is
a
humble
request
for
details
of
your
daily
life
that
i
may
think
of
you
when
absent
etta
drew
in
her
lips
moistening
them
as
if
they
had
suddenly
become
parched
de
chauxville
glanced
at
her
and
moved
toward
the
door
he
paused
with
his
fingers
on
the
handle
and
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
he
said
have
i
made
myself
quite
clear
etta
was
still
looking
out
of
the
window
with
hard
angry
eyes
she
took
no
notice
of
the
question
de
chauxville
turned
the
handle
again
let
me
impress
upon
you
the
advisability
of
implicit
obedience
he
said
with
delicate
insolence
i
mentioned
the
charity
league
but
that
is
not
my
strongest
claim
upon
your
attention
i
have
another
interesting
little
detail
of
your
life
which
i
will
reserve
until

chapter
xxxi
a
dangerous
experiment
a
russian
forest
in
winter
is
one
of
nature
places
of
worship
there
are
some
such
places
in
the
world
where
nature
seems
to
stand
in
the
presence
of
the
deity
a
sunrise
at
sea
night
on
a
mountain
in
a
russian
forest
in
winter
these
places
and
these
times
are
good
for
convalescent
atheists
and
such
as
pose
as
unbelievers
the
cheapest
form
of
notoriety
paul
had
requested
catrina
and
maggie
to
drive
as
quietly
as
possible
through
the
forest
the
warning
was
unnecessary
for
the
stillness
of
snow
is
infectious
while
the
beauty
of
the
scene
seemed
to
command
silence
as
usual
catrina
drove
without
bells
the
one
attendant
on
his
perch
behind
was
a
statue
of
servitude
and
silence
maggie
leaning
back
hidden
to
the
eyes
in
her
sables
had
nothing
to
say
to
her
companion
the
way
lay
through
forests
of
pine
trackless
motionless
virgin
the
sun
filtering
through
the
branches
cast
a
subdued
golden
light
upon
the
ruddy
upright
trunks
of
the
trees
at
times
a
white
as
the
snow
light
and
graceful
on
the
wing
rose
from
the
branch
where
he
had
been
laughing
to
his
mate
with
a
low
cooing
laugh
and
fluttered
away
over
the
trees
a
kooropatka
said
catrina
who
knew
the
life
of
the
forest
almost
as
well
as
paul
whose
very
existence
was
wrapped
up
in
these
things
far
over
the
summits
of
the
pines
a
snipe
seemed
to
be
wheeling
a
sentinel
round
he
followed
them
as
they
sped
along
calling
out
all
the
while
his
deep
warning
note
like
that
of
a
lamb
crouching
beneath
a
hedge
where
the
wind
is
not
tempered
once
or
twice
they
heard
the
dismal
howl
of
a
wolf
the
most
melancholy
the
weirdest
the
most
hopeless
of
nature
calls
the
whole
forest
seemed
to
be
on
the
alert
astir
and
in
suspense
the
wolf
disturbed
in
his
lair
no
doubt
heard
and
understood
the
cry
of
the
watchful
snipe
and
the
sudden
silence
of
the
who
loves
to
sit
and
laugh
when
all
is
safe
a
clumsy
capercailzie
swinging
along
over
the
trees
with
a
great
flap
and
rush
of
wings
seemed
to
be
intent
on
his
own
solitary
majestic
business
a
very
king
among
the
fowls
of
the
air
amid
the
topmost
branches
of
the
pines
the
wind
whispered
and
stirred
like
a
child
in
sleep
but
beneath
all
was
still
every
branch
stood
motionless
beneath
its
burden
of
snow
the
air
was
thin
exhilarating
brilliant
like
dry
champagne
it
seemed
to
send
the
blood
coursing
through
the
veins
with
a
very
joy
of
life
catrina
noted
all
these
things
while
cleverly
handling
her
ponies
they
spoke
to
her
with
a
thousand
voices
she
had
roamed
in
these
same
forests
with
paul
who
loved
them
and
understood
them
as
she
did
maggie
in
the
midst
as
it
were
of
a
revelation
leaned
back
and
wondered
at
it
all
she
too
was
thinking
of
paul
the
owner
of
these
boundless
forests
she
understood
him
better
now
this
drive
had
revealed
to
her
a
part
of
his
nature
which
had
rather
puzzled
her
a
large
simple
quiet
strength
which
had
developed
and
grown
to
maturity
beneath
these
trees
we
are
all
part
of
what
we
have
seen
we
all
carry
with
us
through
life
somewhat
of
the
scenes
through
which
we
passed
in
childhood
maggie
knew
now
where
paul
had
learnt
the
quiet
concentration
of
mind
the
absorption
in
his
own
affairs
the
complete
lack
of
interest
in
the
business
of
his
neighbor
which
made
him
different
from
other
men
he
had
learnt
these
things
at
first
hand
from
god
creatures
these
of
fur
and
feather
went
about
their
affairs
in
the
same
absorbed
way
with
the
same
complete
faith
the
same
desire
to
leave
and
be
left
alone
the
simplicity
of
nature
was
his
his
only
craft
was
forest
craft
now
you
know
said
catrina
when
they
reached
the
hut
why
i
hate
petersburg
maggie
nodded
the
effect
of
the
forest
was
still
upon
her
she
did
not
want
to
talk
the
woman
who
received
them
the
wife
of
a
keeper
had
prepared
in
a
rough
way
for
their
reception
she
had
a
large
fire
and
bowls
of
warm
milk
the
doors
and
windows
had
been
thrown
wide
open
by
paul
orders
he
wanted
to
spare
maggie
too
intimate
an
acquaintance
with
a
russian
interior
the
hut
was
really
a
built
by
paul
some
years
earlier
and
inhabited
by
a
one
learned
in
the
ways
of
bear
and
wolf
and
lynx
the
large
had
been
carefully
scrubbed
there
was
a
smell
of
and
soap
the
table
ready
spread
with
a
simple
luncheon
took
up
nearly
the
whole
of
the
room
while
the
two
girls
were
warming
themselves
a
keeper
came
to
the
door
of
the
hut
and
asked
to
see
catrina
he
stood
in
the
little
completely
filling
it
and
explained
that
he
could
not
come
in
as
the
buckles
and
straps
of
his
were
clogged
and
frozen
he
wore
the
long
norwegian
and
was
held
to
be
the
quickest
runner
in
the
country
catrina
had
a
long
conversation
with
the
man
who
stood
hatless
ruddy
and
shy
it
is
she
then
explained
to
maggie
paul
own
man
who
always
loads
for
him
and
carries
his
spare
gun
he
has
sent
him
to
tell
us
that
the
game
has
been
ringed
and
that
the
beaters
will
close
in
on
a
place
called
the
schapka
clearing
where
there
is
a
woodman
refuge
if
we
care
to
put
on
our
this
man
will
guide
us
to
the
clearing
and
take
care
of
us
till
the
battue
is
over
of
course
maggie
welcomed
the
proposal
with
delight
and
after
a
hasty
luncheon
the
three
glided
off
through
the
forest
as
noiselessly
as
they
had
come
after
a
tiring
walk
of
an
hour
and
more
they
came
to
the
clearing
and
were
duly
concealed
in
the
hut
no
one
the
keeper
told
the
ladies
except
paul
knew
of
their
presence
in
the
little
wooden
house
the
arrangements
of
the
beat
had
been
slightly
altered
at
the
last
moment
after
the
hunters
had
separated
the
keeper
lighted
a
small
fire
and
shyly
attended
to
the
ladies
removing
their
with
clumsy
fingers
he
closed
the
door
and
arranged
a
branch
of
larch
across
the
window
so
that
they
could
stand
near
it
without
being
seen
they
had
not
been
there
long
before
de
chauxville
appeared
he
moved
quickly
across
the
clearing
skimming
over
the
snow
with
long
sweeping
strides
two
keepers
followed
him
and
after
having
shown
him
the
rough
prepared
for
him
silently
withdrew
to
their
places
soon
karl
steinmetz
came
from
another
direction
and
took
up
his
position
rather
nearer
to
the
hut
in
a
thicket
of
pine
and
dwarf
oak
he
was
only
twenty
yards
away
from
the
refuge
where
the
girls
were
concealed
it
was
not
long
before
paul
came
he
was
quite
alone
and
suddenly
appeared
at
the
far
end
of
the
clearing
in
very
truth
a
mighty
hunter
standing
nearly
seven
feet
on
his
one
rifle
he
carried
in
his
hand
another
slung
across
his
back
it
was
like
a
silent
scene
on
a
stage
the
clearing
with
tracks
across
it
where
the
had
passed
the
still
trees
the
brilliant
sun
and
the
blue
depths
of
the
forest
behind
while
paul
like
the
hero
of
some
grim
arctic
saga
a
huge
northern
giant
stood
alone
in
the
desolation
from
his
attitude
it
was
apparent
that
he
was
listening
it
was
probable
that
the
cries
of
the
birds
and
the
distant
howl
of
a
wolf
told
his
practised
ears
how
near
the
beaters
were
he
presently
moved
across
to
where
de
chauxville
was
hidden
spoke
some
words
of
advice
or
warning
to
him
and
pointed
with
his
gloved
hand
in
the
direction
whence
the
game
might
be
expected
to
come
it
subsequently
transpired
that
paul
was
asking
de
chauxville
the
whereabouts
of
steinmetz
who
had
gained
his
place
of
concealment
unobserved
by
either
de
chauxville
could
give
him
no
information
and
paul
went
away
to
his
post
dissatisfied
karl
steinmetz
must
have
seen
them
he
must
have
divined
the
subject
of
their
conversation
but
he
remained
hidden
and
gave
no
sign
paul
post
was
behind
a
fallen
tree
and
the
watchers
in
the
hut
could
see
him
while
he
was
completely
hidden
from
any
animal
that
might
enter
the
open
clearing
from
the
far
end
he
turned
and
looked
hard
at
the
hut
but
the
larch
branch
across
the
window
effectually
prevented
him
from
discovering
whether
any
one
was
behind
it
or
not
thus
they
all
waited
in
suspense
a
blackcock
skimmed
across
the
open
space
and
disappeared
unmolested
a
wolf
gray
gaunt
sneaking
and
lurching
in
his
gait
trotted
into
the
clearing
and
stood
listening
with
evil
lips
drawn
back
the
two
girls
watched
him
breathlessly
when
he
trotted
on
unmolested
they
drew
a
deep
breath
as
if
they
had
been
under
water
paul
with
his
two
rifles
laid
before
him
watched
the
wolf
depart
with
a
smile
the
girls
could
see
the
smile
and
from
it
learnt
somewhat
of
the
man
the
keeper
beside
them
gave
a
little
laugh
and
looked
to
the
hammers
of
his
rifle
and
still
there
was
no
sound
it
was
still
unreal
and
like
a
scene
on
the
stage
the
birds
skimming
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
from
time
to
time
threw
in
as
it
were
a
note
of
fear
and
suspense
there
was
breathlessness
in
the
air
a
couple
of
hares
like
white
shadows
in
their
spotless
winter
coats
shot
from
covert
to
covert
across
the
open
ground
then
suddenly
the
keeper
gave
a
little
grunt
and
held
up
his
hand
listening
with
parted
lips
and
eager
eyes
there
was
a
distinct
sound
of
breaking
branches
and
crackling
underwood
they
could
see
paul
cautiously
rise
from
his
knees
to
a
crouching
attitude
they
followed
the
direction
of
his
gaze
and
before
them
the
monarch
of
these
forests
stood
in
clumsy
might
a
bear
had
shambled
to
the
edge
of
the
clearing
and
was
standing
upright
growling
and
grumbling
to
himself
his
great
paws
waving
from
side
to
side
his
shaggy
head
thrust
forward
with
a
recurring
jerk
singularly
suggestive
of
a
dandy
with
an
uncomfortable
collar
these
bears
of
northern
russia
have
not
the
reputation
of
being
very
fierce
unless
they
are
aroused
from
their
winter
quarters
when
their
wrath
knows
no
bounds
and
their
courage
recognizes
no
danger
an
angry
bear
is
afraid
of
no
living
man
or
beast
moreover
these
kings
of
the
northern
forests
are
huge
beasts
capable
of
smothering
a
strong
man
by
falling
on
him
and
lying
there
a
death
which
has
come
to
more
than
one
daring
hunter
the
favorite
method
of
dealing
with
his
foe
is
to
claw
him
to
death
or
else
hug
him
till
his
ribs
are
snapped
and
crushed
into
his
vitals
the
bear
stood
poking
his
head
and
looking
about
with
little
fiery
bloodshot
eyes
for
something
to
destroy
his
rage
was
manifest
and
in
his
strength
he
was
a
grand
sight
the
majesty
of
power
and
a
dauntless
courage
were
his
it
was
de
chauxville
shot
and
while
keeping
his
eye
on
the
bear
paul
glanced
impatiently
over
his
shoulder
from
time
to
time
wondering
why
the
frenchman
did
not
fire
the
bear
was
a
huge
one
and
would
probably
carry
three
bullets
and
still
be
a
dangerous
adversary
the
keeper
muttered
impatiently
they
were
watching
paul
breathlessly
the
bear
was
approaching
him
it
would
not
be
safe
to
defer
firing
another
second
suddenly
the
keeper
gave
a
short
exclamation
of
astonishment
and
threw
up
his
rifle
there
was
another
bear
behind
paul
shambling
toward
him
unseen
by
him
all
his
attention
was
riveted
on
the
huge
brute
forty
yards
in
front
of
him
it
was
claude
de
chauxville
task
to
protect
paul
from
any
flank
or
rear
attack
and
claude
de
chauxville
was
peering
over
his
covert
watching
with
blanched
face
the
second
bear
and
lifting
no
hand
making
no
sign
the
bear
was
within
a
few
yards
of
paul
who
was
crouching
behind
the
fallen
pine
and
now
raising
his
rifle
to
his
shoulder
in
a
flash
of
comprehension
the
two
girls
saw
all
through
the
panes
of
the
closed
window
it
was
still
singularly
like
a
scene
on
the
stage
the
second
bear
raised
his
powerful
as
he
approached
one
blow
would
tear
open
paul
brain
a
terrific
report
sent
the
girls
staggering
back
for
a
moment
paralyzing
thought
the
keeper
had
fired
through
the
window
both
barrels
almost
simultaneously
it
was
a
question
how
much
lead
would
bring
the
bear
down
before
he
covered
the
intervening
dozen
yards
in
the
confined
space
of
the
hut
the
report
of
the
heavy
double
charge
was
like
that
of
a
cannon
moreover
steinmetz
twenty
yards
away
had
fired
at
the
same
moment
the
room
was
filled
with
smoke
the
two
girls
were
blinded
for
an
instant
then
they
saw
the
keeper
tear
open
the
door
and
disappear
the
cold
air
through
the
shattered
casement
was
a
sudden
relief
to
their
lungs
choked
with
sulphur
and
the
fumes
of
spent
powder
in
a
flash
they
were
out
of
the
open
door
and
there
again
with
the
suddenness
of
a
panorama
they
saw
another
picture
paul
kneeling
in
the
middle
of
the
clearing
taking
careful
aim
at
the
retreating
form
of
the
first
bear
they
saw
the
puff
of
blue
smoke
rise
from
his
rifle
they
heard
the
sharp
report
and
the
bear
rolled
over
on
its
face
steinmetz
and
the
keeper
were
walking
toward
paul
claude
de
chauxville
standing
outside
his
screen
of
brushwood
was
staring
with
wide
eyes
at
the
hut
which
he
had
thought
empty
he
did
not
know
that
there
were
three
people
behind
him
watching
him
what
had
they
seen
what
had
they
understood
catrina
and
maggie
ran
toward
paul
they
were
on
and
made
short
work
of
the
intervening
distance
paul
had
risen
to
his
feet
his
face
was
grave
there
was
a
singular
gleam
in
his
eyes
which
was
not
a
gleam
of
mere
excitement
such
as
the
chase
brings
into
some
men
eyes
steinmetz
looked
at
him
and
said
nothing
for
a
moment
paul
stood
still
he
looked
round
him
noting
with
experienced
glance
the
lay
of
the
whole
incident
the
dead
form
of
the
bear
ten
yards
behind
his
late
one
hundred
and
eighty
yards
from
the
hut
one
hundred
and
sixty
yards
from
the
spot
whence
karl
steinmetz
had
sent
his
unerring
bullet
through
the
bear
brain
paul
saw
it
all
he
measured
the
distances
he
looked
at
de
chauxville
standing
at
his
post
not
fifty
yards
from
the
carcass
of
the
second
bear
paul
seemed
to
see
no
one
but
de
chauxville
he
went
straight
toward
him
and
the
whole
party
followed
in
breathless
suspense
steinmetz
was
nearest
to
him
watching
with
his
keen
quiet
eyes
paul
went
up
to
de
chauxville
and
took
the
rifle
from
his
hands
he
opened
the
breech
and
looked
into
the
barrels
they
were
clean
the
rifle
had
not
been
fired
off
he
gave
a
little
laugh
of
contempt
and
throwing
the
rifle
at
de
chauxville
feet
turned
abruptly
away
it
was
catrina
who
spoke
if
you
had
killed
him
she
said
i
would
have
killed
you
steinmetz
picked
up
the
rifle
closed
the
breech
and
handed
it
to
de
chauxville
with
a
queer
smile
chapter
xxxii
a
cloud
when
the
osterno
party
reached
home
that
same
evening
the
starosta
was
waiting
to
see
steinmetz
his
news
was
such
that
steinmetz
sent
for
paul
and
the
three
men
went
together
to
the
little
room
beyond
the
in
the
old
part
of
the
castle
well
said
paul
with
the
unconscious
hauteur
which
made
him
a
prince
to
these
people
the
starosta
spread
out
his
hands
your
excellency
he
answered
i
am
afraid
of
what
the
starosta
shrugged
his
narrow
shoulders
in
cringing
deprecation
excellency
i
do
not
know
there
is
something
in
the
village
something
in
the
whole
country
i
know
not
what
it
is
it
is
a
feeling
one
can
not
see
it
one
can
not
define
it
but
it
is
there
like
the
gleam
of
water
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
well
the
moujiks
are
getting
dangerous
they
will
not
speak
to
me
i
am
suspected
i
am
watched
his
shifty
eyes
like
black
beads
flitted
from
side
to
side
as
he
spoke
he
was
like
a
weasel
at
bay
it
was
the
face
of
a
man
who
went
in
bodily
fear
i
will
go
with
you
down
to
the
village
now
said
paul
is
there
any
excuse
any
illness
ah
excellency
replied
the
chief
there
is
always
that
excuse
paul
looked
at
the
clock
i
will
go
now
he
said
he
began
his
simple
preparations
at
once
there
is
dinner
to
be
thought
of
suggested
steinmetz
with
a
resigned
smile
it
is
seven
dinner
can
wait
replied
paul
in
english
you
might
tell
the
ladies
that
i
have
gone
out
and
will
dine
alone
when
i
come
back
steinmetz
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
i
think
you
are
a
fool
he
said
to
go
alone
if
they
discover
your
identity
they
will
tear
you
to
pieces
i
am
not
afraid
of
them
replied
paul
with
his
head
in
the
medicine
cupboard
any
more
than
i
am
afraid
of
a
horse
they
are
like
horses
they
do
not
know
their
own
strength
with
this
difference
added
steinmetz
that
the
moujik
will
one
day
make
the
discovery
he
is
beginning
to
make
it
now
the
starosta
is
quite
right
paul
there
is
something
in
the
air
it
is
about
time
that
you
took
the
ladies
away
from
here
and
left
me
to
manage
it
alone
that
time
will
never
come
again
answered
paul
i
am
not
going
to
leave
you
alone
again
he
was
pushing
his
arms
into
the
sleeves
of
the
old
brown
coat
reaching
to
his
heels
a
garment
which
commanded
as
much
love
and
respect
in
osterno
as
ever
would
an
angel
wing
steinmetz
opened
the
drawer
of
his
bureau
and
laid
a
revolver
on
the
table
at
all
events
he
said
you
may
as
well
have
the
wherewithal
to
make
a
fight
of
it
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
as
you
like
answered
paul
slipping
the
into
his
pocket
the
starosta
moved
away
a
pace
or
two
he
was
essentially
a
man
of
peace
half
an
hour
later
it
became
known
in
the
village
that
the
moscow
doctor
was
in
the
house
of
one
ivan
krass
where
he
was
prepared
to
see
all
patients
who
were
now
suffering
from
infectious
complaints
the
door
of
this
cottage
was
soon
besieged
by
the
sick
and
the
idle
while
the
starosta
stood
in
the
and
kept
order
within
in
the
one
of
the
cottage
were
assembled
as
picturesque
and
as
unsavory
a
group
as
the
most
enthusiastic
modern
slummer
could
desire
to
see
paul
standing
by
the
table
with
two
paraffin
lamps
placed
behind
him
saw
each
suppliant
in
turn
and
all
the
while
he
kept
up
a
running
conversation
with
the
more
intelligent
some
of
whom
lingered
on
to
talk
and
watch
ah
john
the
son
of
john
he
would
say
what
is
the
matter
with
you
it
is
not
often
i
see
you
i
thought
you
were
clean
and
thrifty
to
which
john
the
son
of
john
replied
that
the
winter
had
been
hard
and
fuel
scarce
that
his
wife
was
dead
and
his
children
stricken
with
influenza
but
you
have
had
relief
our
good
friend
the
starosta
does
what
he
can
grumbled
john
but
he
dare
not
do
much
the
bárins
will
not
let
him
the
nobles
want
all
the
money
for
themselves
the
emperor
is
living
in
his
palace
where
there
are
fountains
of
wine
we
pay
for
that
with
our
taxes
you
see
my
hand
i
can
not
work
but
i
must
pay
the
taxes
or
else
we
shall
be
turned
out
into
the
street
paul
while
attending
to
the
wounded
hand
an
old
story
of
an
old
wound
neglected
and
a
constitution
with
all
the
natural
healing
power
drained
out
of
it
by
hunger
and
want
and
vodka
paul
ever
watchful
glanced
round
and
saw
sullen
lowering
faces
eager
eyes
hungry
cruel
lips
but
the
winter
is
over
now
you
are
mistaken
about
the
nobles
they
do
what
they
can
the
emperor
pays
for
the
relief
that
you
have
had
all
these
months
it
is
foolish
to
talk
as
you
do
i
only
tell
the
truth
replied
the
man
wincing
as
paul
deliberately
cut
away
the
dead
flesh
we
know
now
why
it
is
that
we
are
all
so
poor
why
asked
paul
pouring
some
lotion
over
a
wad
of
lint
and
speaking
indifferently
because
the
nobles
began
the
man
and
some
one
nudged
him
from
behind
urging
him
to
silence
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
me
said
paul
i
tell
no
tales
and
i
take
no
money
then
why
do
you
come
asked
a
voice
in
the
background
some
one
pays
you
who
is
it
ah
tula
said
paul
without
looking
up
you
are
there
are
you
the
great
tula
there
is
a
hardworking
sober
man
my
little
fathers
who
never
beats
his
wife
and
never
drinks
and
never
borrows
money
a
useful
neighbor
what
is
the
matter
with
you
tula
you
have
been
too
sparing
with
the
vodka
no
doubt
i
must
order
you
a
glass
every
hour
there
was
a
little
laugh
but
paul
who
knew
these
people
was
quite
alive
to
the
difference
of
feeling
toward
himself
they
still
accepted
his
care
his
help
his
medicine
but
they
were
beginning
to
doubt
him
there
is
your
own
prince
he
went
on
fearlessly
to
the
man
whose
hand
he
was
binding
up
he
will
help
you
when
there
is
real
distress
an
ominous
silence
greeted
this
observation
paul
raised
his
head
and
looked
round
in
the
dim
light
of
the
two
smoky
lamps
he
saw
a
ring
of
wild
faces
men
with
shaggy
beards
and
hair
all
entangled
and
unkempt
with
fierce
eyes
and
lowering
glances
women
with
faces
that
unsexed
them
there
were
despair
and
desperation
and
utter
recklessness
in
the
air
in
the
attitude
in
the
hearts
of
these
people
and
paul
had
worked
among
them
for
years
the
sight
would
have
been
had
paul
howard
alexis
been
the
sort
of
man
to
admit
the
possibility
of
a
broken
heart
all
that
he
had
done
had
been
frustrated
by
the
wall
of
heartless
bureaucracy
against
which
he
had
pitched
his
single
strength
there
was
no
visible
progress
these
were
not
the
faces
of
men
and
women
moving
up
the
social
scale
by
the
aid
of
education
and
the
deeper
that
follows
it
some
of
them
were
young
although
they
hardly
looked
it
they
were
young
in
years
but
old
in
life
and
misery
some
of
them
he
knew
to
be
educated
he
had
paid
for
the
education
himself
he
had
risked
his
own
personal
freedom
to
procure
it
for
them
and
misery
had
killed
the
seed
he
looked
on
this
stony
ground
and
his
stout
heart
was
torn
with
pity
it
is
easy
to
be
patient
in
social
economy
when
that
vague
jumble
of
impossible
ideas
is
calmly
discussed
across
the
but
the
result
seems
hopelessly
distant
when
the
mass
of
the
poor
and
wretched
stand
before
one
in
the
flesh
paul
knew
that
this
little
room
was
only
a
specimen
of
the
whole
of
russia
each
of
these
poor
peasants
represented
a
million
equally
hopeless
equally
powerless
to
contend
with
an
impossible
taxation
he
could
not
give
them
money
because
the
had
them
all
under
his
thumb
and
would
exact
the
last
kopeck
the
question
was
far
above
his
reach
and
he
did
not
dare
to
meet
it
openly
and
seek
the
assistance
of
the
few
who
faced
the
position
without
fear
he
could
not
see
in
the
brutal
faces
before
him
one
spark
of
intelligence
one
little
gleam
of
independence
and
which
could
be
attributed
to
his
endeavor
which
the
most
sanguine
construction
could
take
as
resulting
from
his
time
and
money
given
to
a
hopeless
cause
well
he
said
have
you
nothing
to
tell
me
of
your
prince
you
know
him
answered
the
man
who
had
spoken
from
the
safe
background
we
need
not
tell
you
yes
answered
paul
i
know
him
he
would
not
defend
himself
there
he
went
on
addressing
the
man
whose
hand
was
now
bandaged
you
will
do
keep
clean
and
sober
and
it
will
heal
get
drunk
and
go
dirty
and
you
will
die
do
you
understand
ivan
ivanovitch
the
man
grunted
sullenly
and
moved
away
to
give
place
to
a
woman
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
paul
glanced
into
her
face
he
had
known
her
a
few
years
earlier
a
happy
child
playing
at
her
mother
cottage
door
she
drew
back
the
shawl
that
covered
her
child
with
a
faint
gleam
of
pride
in
her
eyes
there
was
something
horribly
pathetic
in
the
whole
picture
the
her
rough
unlovely
face
lighted
for
a
moment
with
that
gleam
from
paradise
which
men
never
know
the
huge
man
bending
over
her
and
between
them
the
wizened
little
waif
of
humanity
when
he
was
born
he
was
a
very
fine
child
said
the
mother
paul
glanced
at
her
she
was
quite
serious
she
was
looking
at
him
with
a
strange
pride
on
her
face
paul
nodded
and
drew
aside
the
shawl
the
baby
was
staring
at
him
with
wise
grave
eyes
as
if
it
could
have
told
him
a
thing
or
two
if
it
had
only
been
gifted
with
the
necessary
speech
paul
knew
that
look
it
meant
starvation
what
is
it
asked
the
it
is
only
some
little
illness
is
it
not
yes
it
is
only
a
little
illness
he
did
not
add
that
no
great
illness
is
required
to
kill
a
small
child
he
was
already
writing
something
in
his
he
tore
the
leaf
out
and
gave
it
to
her
this
he
said
is
for
you
yourself
you
understand
take
that
each
day
to
the
starosta
and
he
will
give
you
what
i
have
written
down
if
you
do
not
eat
all
that
he
gives
you
and
drink
what
there
is
in
the
bottle
as
he
directs
you
the
baby
will
die
you
understand
you
must
give
nothing
away
nothing
even
to
your
husband
the
next
patient
was
the
man
whose
voice
had
been
heard
from
the
safe
retreat
of
the
background
his
dominant
malady
was
obvious
a
shaky
hand
an
unsteady
eye
and
a
bloated
countenance
spoke
for
themselves
but
he
had
other
diseases
more
or
less
developed
so
you
have
no
good
to
tell
of
your
prince
said
paul
looking
into
the
man
face
our
prince
excellency
he
is
not
our
prince
his
forefathers
seized
this
land
that
is
all
ah
who
has
been
telling
you
that
no
one
grumbled
the
man
we
know
it
that
is
all
but
you
were
his
father
serfs
before
the
freedom
let
me
see
your
tongue
yes
you
have
been
drinking
all
the
winter
ah
is
not
that
so
little
father
your
parents
were
serfs
before
the
freedom
freedom
growled
the
man
a
pretty
freedom
we
were
better
off
before
yes
but
the
world
interfered
with
serfdom
because
it
got
its
necessary
touch
of
sentiment
there
is
no
sentiment
in
starvation
the
man
did
not
understand
he
grunted
acquiescence
nevertheless
the
true
son
of
the
people
is
always
ready
to
grunt
acquiescence
to
all
that
sounds
like
abuse
and
what
is
this
prince
like
have
you
seen
him
went
on
paul
no
i
have
not
seen
him
if
i
saw
him
i
would
kick
his
head
to
pieces
ah
just
open
your
mouth
a
little
wider
yes
you
have
a
nasty
throat
there
you
have
had
diphtheria
so
you
would
kick
his
head
to
pieces
why
he
is
a
tchinovnik
a
government
spy
he
lives
on
the
taxes
but
it
will
not
be
for
long
there
is
a
time
coming
ah
what
sort
of
a
time
now
you
must
take
this
to
the
starosta
he
will
give
you
a
bottle
it
is
not
to
drink
it
is
to
wash
your
throat
with
remember
that
and
do
not
give
it
to
your
wife
by
way
of
a
tonic
as
you
did
last
time
so
there
are
changes
coming
are
there
there
is
a
change
coming
for
the
prince
for
all
the
princes
replied
the
man
in
the
usual
taproom
jargon
for
the
emperor
too
the
poor
man
has
had
enough
of
it
god
made
the
world
for
the
poor
man
as
well
as
for
the
rich
riches
should
be
equally
divided
they
are
going
to
be
the
country
is
going
to
be
governed
by
a
mir
there
will
be
no
taxes
the
mir
makes
no
taxes
it
is
the
tchinovniks
who
make
the
taxes
and
live
on
them
ah
you
are
very
eloquent
little
father
if
you
talk
like
this
in
the
kabak
no
wonder
you
have
a
bad
throat
there
i
can
do
no
more
for
you
you
must
wash
more
and
drink
less
you
might
try
a
little
work
perhaps
it
stimulates
the
appetite
and
with
a
throat
like
that
i
should
not
talk
so
much
if
i
were
you
next
the
next
comer
was
afflicted
with
a
wound
that
would
not
heal
a
common
trouble
in
cold
countries
while
attending
to
this
sickening
sore
paul
continued
his
conversation
with
the
last
patient
you
must
tell
me
he
said
when
these
changes
are
about
to
come
i
should
like
to
be
there
to
see
it
will
be
interesting
the
man
laughed
mysteriously
so
the
government
is
to
be
by
a
mir
is
it
went
on
paul
yes
the
poor
man
is
to
have
a
say
in
it
that
will
be
interesting
but
at
the
mir
every
one
talks
at
once
and
no
one
listens
is
it
not
so
the
man
made
no
reply
is
the
change
coming
soon
asked
paul
coolly
but
there
was
no
reply
some
one
had
seized
the
loquacious
orator
of
the
kabak
and
he
was
at
that
moment
being
quietly
hustled
out
of
the
room
after
this
there
was
a
sullen
silence
which
paul
could
not
charm
away
charm
he
never
so
wisely
when
his
patients
had
at
last
ebbed
away
he
lighted
a
cigarette
and
walked
thoughtfully
back
to
the
castle
there
was
danger
in
the
air
and
this
was
one
of
those
men
upon
whom
danger
acts
as
a
pleasant
stimulant
chapter
xxxiii
the
net
is
drawn
during
the
days
following
paul
visit
to
the
village
the
ladies
did
not
see
much
male
society
paul
and
steinmetz
usually
left
the
castle
immediately
after
breakfast
and
did
not
return
till
nightfall
is
there
any
thing
wrong
maggie
asked
steinmetz
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
steinmetz
had
just
come
into
the
vast
dressed
for
dinner
stout
placid
and
very
they
were
alone
in
the
room
nothing
my
dear
young
lady
yet
he
answered
coming
forward
and
rubbing
his
broad
palms
slowly
together
maggie
was
reading
an
english
newspaper
she
turned
its
pages
without
pausing
to
notice
the
black
and
sticky
obliterations
effected
by
the
postal
authorities
before
delivery
it
was
no
new
thing
to
her
now
to
come
upon
the
press
censor
handiwork
in
the
columns
of
such
periodicals
and
newspapers
as
paul
received
from
england
because
she
said
if
there
is
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
telling
me
to
have
that
fear
would
be
to
offer
you
an
insult
replied
steinmetz
paul
and
i
are
investigating
matters
that
is
all
the
plain
truth
my
dear
young
lady
is
that
we
do
not
know
ourselves
what
is
in
the
wind
we
only
know
there
is
something
you
are
a
horsewoman
you
know
the
feeling
of
a
restive
horse
one
knows
that
he
is
only
waiting
for
an
excuse
to
shy
or
to
kick
or
to
rear
one
feels
it
thrilling
in
him
paul
and
i
have
that
feeling
in
regard
to
the
peasants
we
are
going
the
round
of
the
outlying
villages
steadily
and
carefully
we
are
seeking
for
the
fly
on
the
horse
body
you
understand
yes
i
understand
she
gave
a
little
nod
she
had
not
lost
color
but
there
was
an
anxious
look
in
her
eyes
some
people
would
have
sent
to
tver
for
the
soldiers
steinmetz
went
on
but
paul
is
not
that
sort
of
man
he
will
not
do
it
yet
you
remember
our
conversation
at
the
charity
ball
in
london
yes
i
did
not
want
you
to
come
then
i
am
sorry
you
have
come
now
maggie
laid
aside
the
newspaper
with
a
little
laugh
but
herr
steinmetz
she
said
i
am
not
afraid
please
remember
that
i
have
absolute
faith
in
you
and
in
paul
steinmetz
accepted
this
statement
with
his
grave
smile
there
is
only
one
thing
i
would
recommend
he
said
and
that
is
a
perfect
discretion
speak
of
this
to
no
one
especially
to
no
servants
you
remember
your
own
mutiny
in
india
gott
what
wonderful
people
you
english
are
men
and
women
alike
you
remember
how
the
ladies
kept
up
and
brazened
it
out
before
the
servants
you
must
do
the
same
i
think
i
hear
the
rustle
of
the
princess
dress
yes
and
there
is
no
news
in
the
papers
you
say
none
replied
maggie
it
may
not
have
been
entirely
by
chance
that
claude
de
chauxville
drove
over
to
osterno
to
pay
his
respects
the
next
day
and
expressed
himself
desolated
at
hearing
that
the
prince
had
gone
out
with
herr
steinmetz
in
a
sleigh
to
a
distant
corner
of
the
estate
my
horses
must
rest
said
the
frenchman
calmly
taking
off
his
fur
gloves
perhaps
the
princess
will
see
me
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
shown
into
the
did
i
see
mlle
delafield
on
in
the
forest
as
i
came
along
de
chauxville
asked
the
servant
in
perfect
russian
before
the
man
left
the
room
doubtless
excellency
she
went
out
on
her
half
an
hour
ago
that
is
all
right
said
the
frenchman
to
himself
when
the
door
was
closed
he
went
to
the
fire
and
warmed
his
slim
white
fingers
there
was
an
evil
smile
lurking
beneath
his
mustache
when
etta
opened
the
door
a
minute
later
he
bowed
low
without
speaking
there
was
a
suggestion
of
triumph
in
his
attitude
well
said
the
princess
without
acknowledging
his
salutation
de
chauxville
raised
his
eyebrows
with
the
resigned
surprise
of
a
man
to
whom
no
feminine
humor
is
new
he
brought
forward
a
chair
will
you
sit
he
said
with
exaggerated
courtesy
i
have
much
to
say
to
you
besides
we
have
all
the
time
your
husband
and
his
german
friend
are
miles
away
i
passed
miss
delafield
in
the
forest
she
is
not
quite
at
home
on
her
yet
she
can
not
be
back
for
at
least
half
an
hour
etta
bit
her
lip
as
she
looked
at
the
chair
she
sat
slowly
down
and
drew
in
the
folds
of
her
rich
dress
i
have
the
good
fortune
to
find
you
alone
so
you
have
informed
me
she
replied
coldly
de
chauxville
leaned
against
the
and
looked
down
at
her
thoughtfully
at
the
the
other
day
he
said
i
had
the
misfortune
to
well
to
fall
out
with
the
prince
we
were
not
quite
at
one
on
a
question
of
etiquette
he
thought
that
i
ought
to
have
fired
i
did
not
fire
i
was
not
ready
it
appears
that
the
prince
considered
himself
to
be
in
danger
he
was
nervous
flurried
you
are
not
always
artistic
in
your
untruths
interrupted
etta
i
know
nothing
of
the
incident
to
which
you
refer
but
in
lying
you
should
always
endeavor
to
be
consistent
i
am
sure
paul
was
not
nervous
or
flurried
de
chauxville
smiled
imperturbably
his
end
was
gained
etta
obviously
knew
nothing
of
his
attempt
to
murder
paul
at
the
it
was
nothing
he
went
on
we
did
not
come
to
words
but
we
have
never
been
much
in
sympathy
the
coldness
is
intensified
that
is
all
so
i
took
the
opportunity
of
calling
when
i
knew
he
was
away
how
did
you
know
he
was
away
ah
madame
i
know
more
than
i
am
credited
with
etta
gave
a
little
laugh
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
you
do
not
care
for
osterno
suggested
de
chauxville
i
hate
it
precisely
and
i
am
here
to
help
you
to
get
away
from
russia
once
for
all
ah
you
may
shake
your
head
some
day
perhaps
i
shall
succeed
in
convincing
you
that
i
have
only
your
interests
at
heart
i
am
here
princess
to
make
a
little
arrangement
with
you
a
final
arrangement
i
hope
he
paused
looking
at
her
with
a
sudden
gleam
in
his
eyes
not
the
last
of
all
he
added
in
a
different
tone
that
will
make
you
my
wife
etta
allowed
this
statement
to
pass
unchallenged
her
courage
and
energy
were
not
exhausted
she
was
learning
to
nurse
her
forces
your
husband
went
on
de
chauxville
after
he
had
sufficiently
enjoyed
the
savor
of
his
own
words
is
a
brave
man
to
frighten
him
it
is
necessary
to
resort
to
strong
measures
the
last
and
the
strongest
measure
in
the
diplomat
scale
is
the
people
the
people
madame
will
take
no
denial
it
is
a
game
i
have
played
before
a
dangerous
game
but
i
am
not
afraid
you
need
not
trouble
to
be
theatrical
with
me
put
in
etta
scornfully
she
was
sitting
with
a
patch
of
color
in
either
cheek
at
times
this
man
had
the
power
of
moving
her
and
she
was
afraid
of
allowing
him
to
exercise
it
she
knew
her
own
weakness
her
inordinate
vanity
for
vanity
is
the
weakness
of
strong
women
she
was
ever
open
to
flattery
and
claude
de
chauxville
flattered
her
in
every
word
he
spoke
for
by
act
and
speech
he
made
it
manifest
that
she
was
the
motive
power
of
his
existence
a
man
who
plays
for
a
high
stake
went
on
the
frenchman
in
a
quieter
voice
must
be
content
to
throw
his
all
on
the
table
time
after
time
a
week
thursday
the
of
april
i
will
throw
down
my
all
on
the
turn
of
a
card
for
the
people
are
like
that
it
is
rouge
or
noir
one
never
knows
we
only
know
that
there
is
no
third
color
no
compromise
etta
was
listening
now
with
interest
at
last
he
had
given
her
something
definite
a
date
on
thursday
he
went
on
the
peasants
will
make
a
demonstration
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
as
well
as
prince
pavlo
does
despite
his
imperturbable
face
that
the
whole
country
is
a
volcano
which
may
break
forth
at
any
moment
but
the
control
is
strong
and
therefore
there
is
never
a
large
eruption
a
grumble
here
a
gleam
of
fire
there
a
sullen
heat
everywhere
but
it
is
held
in
check
by
the
impossibility
of
communication
it
seems
strange
but
russia
stands
because
she
has
no
penny
postage
the
great
crash
will
come
not
by
force
of
arms
but
by
ways
of
peace
the
signal
will
be
a
postal
system
the
standard
of
the
revolution
will
be
a
all
over
this
country
there
are
millions
waiting
and
burning
to
rise
up
and
crush
despotism
but
they
are
held
in
check
by
the
simple
fact
that
they
are
far
apart
and
they
can
not
write
to
each
other
when
at
last
they
are
brought
together
there
will
be
no
fight
at
all
because
they
will
overwhelm
their
enemies
that
time
madame
has
not
come
yet
we
are
only
at
the
stage
of
tentative
underground
rumblings
but
a
little
eruption
is
enough
to
wipe
out
one
man
if
he
be
standing
on
the
spot
go
on
said
etta
quietly
too
quietly
de
chauxville
might
have
thought
had
he
been
calmer
i
want
you
he
went
on
to
assist
me
we
shall
be
ready
on
thursday
i
shall
not
appear
in
the
matter
at
all
i
have
strong
colleagues
at
my
back
starvation
and
misery
properly
handled
are
strong
incentives
and
how
do
you
propose
to
handle
them
asked
etta
in
the
same
quiet
voice
the
peasants
will
make
a
demonstration
the
rest
we
must
leave
to
well
to
the
course
of
fortune
i
have
no
doubt
that
our
astute
friend
karl
steinmetz
will
manage
to
hold
them
in
check
but
whatever
the
end
of
the
demonstration
the
outcome
will
be
the
impossibility
of
a
longer
residence
in
this
country
for
the
prince
pavlo
alexis
a
regiment
of
soldiers
could
hardly
make
it
possible
i
do
not
understand
said
etta
what
you
describe
as
a
demonstration
is
it
a
rising
de
chauxville
nodded
with
a
grin
in
force
to
take
what
they
want
by
force
asked
the
princess
de
chauxville
spread
out
his
hands
in
his
graceful
gallic
way
that
depends
and
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
asked
etta
with
the
same
concentrated
quiet
in
the
first
place
to
believe
that
no
harm
will
come
to
you
either
directly
or
indirectly
they
would
not
dare
to
touch
the
prince
they
will
content
themselves
with
breaking
a
few
windows
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
repeated
etta
de
chauxville
paused
merely
he
answered
lightly
to
leave
open
a
door
a
side
door
i
understand
that
there
is
a
door
in
the
old
portion
of
the
castle
leading
up
by
a
flight
of
stairs
to
the
and
thence
to
the
new
part
of
the
building
etta
did
not
answer
de
chauxville
glanced
at
his
watch
and
walked
to
the
window
where
he
stood
looking
out
he
was
too
refined
a
person
to
whistle
but
his
attitude
was
suggestive
of
that
mode
of
killing
time
this
door
i
wish
you
to
unbar
yourself
before
dinner
on
thursday
evening
he
said
turning
round
and
slowly
coming
toward
her
and
i
refuse
to
do
it
said
etta
ah
etta
sprung
to
her
feet
and
faced
him
a
beautiful
woman
a
very
queen
of
anger
her
blazing
eyes
were
on
a
level
with
his
yes
she
cried
with
clenched
fists
standing
her
full
height
till
she
seemed
to
look
down
into
his
mean
face
yes
i
refuse
to
betray
my
husband
stop
he
is
not
your
husband
slowly
the
anger
faded
out
of
her
eyes
her
clenched
fists
relaxed
her
fingers
were
scraping
nervously
at
the
silk
of
her
dress
like
the
fingers
of
a
child
seeking
support
she
seemed
to
lose
several
inches
of
her
majestic
stature
what
do
you
mean
she
whispered
what
do
you
mean
sydney
bamborough
is
your
husband
said
the
frenchman
without
taking
his
dull
eyes
from
her
face
he
is
dead
she
hissed
prove
it
he
walked
past
her
and
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
in
the
pose
of
easy
familiarity
which
he
had
maintained
during
the
first
portion
of
their
interview
prove
it
madame
he
said
again
he
died
at
tver
she
said
but
there
was
no
conviction
in
her
voice
with
her
title
and
position
to
hold
to
she
could
face
the
world
without
these
what
was
she
a
local
newspaper
reports
that
the
body
of
a
man
was
discovered
on
the
plains
of
tver
and
duly
buried
in
the
pauper
cemetery
said
de
chauxville
indifferently
your
husband
sydney
bamborough
i
mean
was
for
reasons
which
need
not
be
gone
into
here
in
the
neighborhood
of
tver
at
the
time
a
police
officer
who
has
since
been
transferred
to
odessa
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
dead
man
was
a
foreigner
there
are
about
twelve
thousand
foreigners
in
tver
operatives
in
the
manufactories
your
husband
sydney
bamborough
bien
entendu
left
tver
to
proceed
eastward
and
cross
siberia
to
china
in
order
to
avoid
the
emissaries
of
the
charity
league
who
were
looking
out
for
him
at
the
western
frontier
he
will
be
due
at
one
of
the
treaty
ports
in
china
in
about
a
month
upon
the
supposition
that
the
body
discovered
on
the
plains
of
tver
was
that
of
your
husband
you
took
the
opportunity
of
becoming
a
princess
it
was
enterprising
i
admire
your
spirit
but
it
was
dangerous
i
madame
can
suppress
sydney
bamborough
when
he
turns
up
i
have
two
arrows
in
my
quiver
for
him
one
is
the
charity
league
the
other
the
russian
government
who
want
him
your
husband
i
beg
your
pardon
the
prince
would
perhaps
take
a
different
view
of
the
case
it
is
a
pretty
story
i
will
tell
it
to
him
unless
i
have
your
implicit
obedience
etta
stood
before
him
she
tried
to
speak
but
no
words
came
from
her
lips
de
chauxville
looked
at
her
with
a
quiet
smile
of
triumph
and
she
knew
that
he
loved
her
there
is
no
defining
love
nor
telling
when
it
merges
into
hatred
thursday
evening
before
dinner
said
de

and
he
left
her
standing
on
the
her
lips
moving
and
framing
no
words
chapter
xxxiv
an
appeal
have
you
spoken
to
the
princess
asked
steinmetz
without
taking
the
cigar
from
his
lips
they
were
driving
home
through
the
forest
that
surrounded
osterno
as
the
sea
surrounds
an
island
they
were
alone
in
the
sleigh
that
which
they
had
been
doing
had
required
no
servant
paul
was
driving
and
consequently
the
three
horses
were
going
as
hard
as
they
could
the
snow
flew
past
their
faces
like
the
foam
over
the
gunwale
of
a
boat
that
is
thrashing
into
a
breeze
yet
it
was
not
all
snow
there
were
flecks
of
foam
from
the
horses
mouths
mingled
with
it
yes
answered
paul
his
face
was
set
and
hard
his
eyes
stern
this
trouble
with
the
peasants
was
affecting
him
more
keenly
than
he
suspected
it
was
changing
the
man
face
drawing
lines
about
his
lips
streaking
his
forehead
with
the
marks
of
care
his
position
can
hardly
be
realized
by
an
englishman
unless
it
be
compared
to
that
of
the
captain
of
a
great
sinking
ship
full
of
human
souls
who
have
been
placed
under
his
care
and
what
did
she
say
asked
steinmetz
that
she
would
not
leave
unless
we
all
went
with
her
steinmetz
drew
the
furs
closer
up
round
him
yes
he
said
glancing
at
his
companion
face
and
seeing
little
but
the
eyes
by
reason
of
the
sable
collar
of
his
coat
which
met
the
fur
of
his
cap
yes
and
why
not
i
can
not
leave
them
answered
paul
i
can
not
go
away
now
that
there
is
trouble
among
them
what
it
is
goodness
only
knows
they
would
never
have
got
like
this
by
themselves
somebody
has
been
at
them
and
i
think
it
is
the
nihilists
it
is
worse
than
that
some
devil
has
been
stirring
them
up
and
they
know
no
better
he
is
still
at
it
they
are
getting
worse
day
by
day
and
i
can
not
catch
him
if
i
do
by
god
steinmetz
i
twist
his
neck
steinmetz
smiled
grimly
yes
he
answered
you
are
capable
of
it
for
me
i
am
getting
tired
of
the
moujik
he
is
an
inveterate
incurable
fool
if
he
is
going
to
be
a
dangerous
fool
as
well
i
should
almost
be
inclined
to
let
him
go
to
the
devil
in
his
own
way
i
dare
say
but
you
are
not
in
my
position
no
that
is
true
pavlo
they
were
not
my
father
serfs
generations
of
my
ancestors
have
not
saved
generations
of
their
ancestors
from
starvation
my
fathers
before
me
have
not
toiled
and
slaved
and
legislated
for
them
i
have
not
learnt
medicine
that
i
might
doctor
them
i
have
not
risked
my
health
and
life
in
their
sties
where
pigs
would
refuse
to
live
i
have
not
given
my
whole
heart
and
soul
to
their
welfare
to
receive
no
thanks
but
only
hatred
no
it
is
different
for
me
i
owe
them
nothing
mein
lieber
that
is
the
difference
if
i
agree
to
make
a
bolt
for
petersburg
will
you
come
retorted
paul
no
answered
the
stout
man
i
thought
not
your
cynicism
is
only
a
matter
of
words
steinmetz
and
not
of
deeds
there
is
no
question
of
either
of
us
leaving
osterno
we
must
stay
and
fight
it
right
out
here
that
is
so
answered
steinmetz
with
the
teutonic
stolidity
of
manner
which
sometimes
came
over
him
but
the
ladies
what
of
them
paul
did
not
answer
they
were
passing
over
the
rise
of
a
heavy
drift
it
was
necessary
to
keep
the
horses
up
to
their
work
to
prevent
the
runners
of
the
sleigh
sinking
into
the
snow
with
voice
and
whip
paul
encouraged
them
he
was
kind
to
animals
but
never
spared
them
a
strong
man
who
gave
freely
of
his
strength
and
expected
an
equal
generosity
this
is
no
place
for
miss
delafield
added
steinmetz
looking
straight
in
front
of
him
i
know
that
answered
paul
sharply
i
wish
to
god
she
was
not
here
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
and
the
words
were
lost
beneath
the
frozen
mustache
steinmetz
made
no
answer
they
drove
on
through
the
gathering
gloom
the
sky
was
of
a
yellow
gray
and
the
earth
reflected
the
dismal
hue
of
it
presently
it
began
to
snow
driving
in
a
fine
haze
from
the
north
the
two
men
lapsed
into
silence
steinmetz
buried
in
his
furs
like
a
great
cumbrous
bear
appeared
to
be
half
asleep
they
had
had
a
long
and
wearisome
day
the
horses
had
covered
their
forty
miles
and
more
from
village
to
village
where
the
two
men
had
only
gathered
discouragement
and
foreboding
some
of
the
starostas
were
sullen
others
openly
scared
none
of
them
were
glad
to
see
steinmetz
paul
had
never
dared
to
betray
his
identity
with
the
gendarmes
the
tchinovniks
they
had
not
deemed
it
wise
to
hold
communication
stop
cried
steinmetz
suddenly
and
paul
pulled
the
horses
on
to
their
haunches
i
thought
you
were
asleep
he
said
there
was
no
one
in
sight
they
were
driving
along
the
new
road
now
the
paul
had
constructed
from
osterno
to
tver
the
road
itself
was
of
course
indistinguishable
but
the
telegraph
posts
marked
its
course
steinmetz
tumbled
heavily
out
of
his
furs
and
went
toward
the
nearest
telegraph
post
where
is
the
wire
he
shouted
paul
followed
him
in
the
sleigh
together
they
peered
up
into
the
darkness
and
the
falling
snow
the
posts
were
there
but
the
wire
was
gone
a
whole
length
of
it
had
been
removed
they
were
cut
off
from
civilization
by
one
hundred
and
forty
miles
of
untrodden
snow
steinmetz
clambered
back
into
the
sleigh
and
drew
up
the
fur
apron
he
gave
a
strange
little
laugh
that
had
a
ring
of
boyish
excitement
in
it
this
man
had
not
always
been
stout
and
placid
he
too
had
had
his
day
and
those
who
knew
him
said
that
it
had
been
a
stirring
one
that
settles
one
question
he
said
which
question
asked
paul
he
was
driving
as
hard
as
the
horses
could
lay
hoof
to
ground
taken
with
a
sudden
misgiving
and
a
great
desire
to
reach
osterno
before
dark
the
question
of
the
ladies
replied
steinmetz
it
is
too
late
for
them
to
go
now
the
village
nestling
beneath
the
grim
protection
of
osterno
was
deserted
and
forlorn
all
the
doors
were
closed
the
meagre
curtains
drawn
it
was
very
cold
there
was
a
sense
of
relief
in
this
great
frost
for
when
nature
puts
forth
her
strength
men
are
usually
cowed
thereby
at
the
castle
all
seemed
to
be
in
order
the
groom
in
his
great
sheepskin
coat
was
waiting
in
the
doorway
the
servants
threw
open
the
vast
doors
and
stood
respectfully
in
the
warm
brilliantly
lighted
hall
while
their
master
passed
in
where
is
the
princess
steinmetz
asked
his
valet
while
he
was
removing
the
evidences
of
a
long
day
in
the
open
air
in
her
excellency
then
go
and
ask
her
if
she
will
give
me
a
cup
of
tea
in
a
few
minutes
and
the
man
a
timorous
german
went
a
few
minutes
later
steinmetz
presenting
himself
at
the
door
of
the
little
attached
to
etta
suite
of
rooms
found
the
princess
in
a
matchless
waiting
beside
a
table
laden
with
silver
tea
appliances
a
dainty
samovar
a
tiny
a
and
the
rest
all
in
the
wonderful
of
the
slavonski
bazaar
in
moscow
you
see
she
said
with
a
smile
for
she
always
smiled
on
men
i
have
obeyed
your
orders
steinmetz
bowed
gravely
he
was
one
of
the
few
men
who
could
see
that
smile
and
be
strong
he
closed
the
door
carefully
behind
him
no
mention
was
made
of
the
fact
that
his
message
had
implied
and
she
had
understood
that
he
wished
to
see
her
alone
etta
was
rather
pale
there
was
an
anxious
look
in
her
eyes
behind
the
smile
as
it
were
she
was
afraid
of
this
man
she
looked
at
the
flame
of
the
samovar
busying
herself
among
the
with
pretty
curving
fingers
and
rustling
sleeves
but
the
tea
was
never
made
i
begin
to
think
said
steinmetz
coming
to
the
point
in
his
bluff
way
that
you
are
a
sort
of
beautiful
jonah
a
graceful
stormy
petrel
a
fair
wandering
jewess
there
is
always
trouble
where
you
go
she
glanced
at
his
broad
face
and
read
nothing
there
go
on
she
said
what
have
i
been
doing
now
how
you
do
hate
me
herr
steinmetz
perhaps
it
is
safer
than
loving
you
he
answered
with
his
grim
humor
i
suppose
she
said
with
a
quaint
little
air
of
resignation
which
was
very
disarming
that
you
have
come
here
to
scold
me
you
do
not
want
any
tea
no
i
do
not
want
any
tea
she
turned
the
wick
of
the
and
the
peaceful
music
of
the
samovar
was
still
in
her
clever
eyes
there
was
a
little
air
of
sidelong
indecision
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
how
to
take
him
her
chiefest
method
was
so
old
as
to
be
biblical
yet
she
could
not
take
him
with
her
eyelids
she
had
tried
you
are
horribly
grave
she
said
the
situation
he
replied
is
horribly
grave
etta
looked
up
at
him
as
he
stood
before
her
and
the
falling
on
the
perfect
oval
of
her
face
showed
it
to
be
white
and
drawn
princess
said
the
man
there
are
in
the
lives
of
some
of
us
times
when
we
cease
to
be
men
and
women
and
become
mere
human
beings
there
are
times
i
mean
when
the
thousand
influences
of
sex
die
at
one
blow
of
fate
this
is
such
a
time
we
must
forget
that
you
are
a
beautiful
woman
i
verily
believe
that
there
is
none
more
beautiful
in
the
world
i
once
knew
one
whom
i
admired
more
but
that
was
not
because
she
was
more
beautiful
that
however
is
my
own
story
and
this
he
paused
and
looked
round
the
little
room
furnished
decorated
for
her
comfort
this
is
your
story
we
must
forget
that
i
am
a
man
and
therefore
subject
to
the
influence
of
your
beauty
she
sat
looking
up
into
his
strong
grave
face
and
during
all
that
followed
she
never
moved
i
know
you
he
said
to
be
courageous
and
must
ask
you
to
believe
that
i
exaggerate
nothing
in
what
i
am
about
to
tell
you
i
tell
it
to
you
instead
of
leaving
paul
to
do
so
because
i
know
his
complete
fearlessness
and
his
blind
faith
in
a
people
who
are
unworthy
of
it
he
does
not
realize
the
gravity
of
the
situation
they
are
his
own
people
a
sailor
never
believes
that
his
own
ship
is
unseaworthy
go
on
said
etta
for
he
had
paused
this
country
he
continued
is
unsettled
the
people
of
the
estate
are
on
the
brink
of
a
revolt
you
know
what
the
russian
peasant
is
it
will
be
no
parisian
émeute
half
noise
half
laughter
we
can
not
hope
to
hold
this
old
place
against
them
we
can
not
get
away
from
it
we
can
not
send
for
help
because
we
have
no
one
to
send
princess
this
is
no
time
for
i
know
for
i
know
these
people
better
even
than
paul
knows
them
i
am
convinced
that
this
is
not
the
outcome
of
their
own
brains
they
are
being
urged
on
by
some
one
there
is
some
one
at
their
backs
this
is
no
revolt
of
the
peasants
organized
by
the
peasants
princess
you
must
tell
me
all
you
know
i
i
she
stammered
i
know
nothing
and
then
suddenly
she
burst
into
tears
and
buried
her
face
in
a
tiny
useless
handkerchief
it
was
so
unlike
her
and
so
sudden
that
steinmetz
was
startled
he
laid
his
great
hand
soothingly
on
her
shoulder
i
know
he
said
quietly
i
know
more
than
you
think
i
am
no
saint
princess
myself
i
too
have
had
my
difficulties
i
have
had
my
temptations
and
i
have
not
always
resisted
god
knows
it
is
difficult
for
men
to
do
always
the
right
thing
it
is
a
thousand
times
more
difficult
for
women
when
we
spoke
together
in
petersburg
and
i
offered
you
my
poor
friendship
i
was
not
acting
in
the
dark
i
knew
as
much
then
as
i
do
now
princess
i
knew
about
the
charity
league
papers
i
knew
more
than
any
except
stépan
lanovitch
and
it
was
he
who
told
me
he
was
stroking
her
shoulder
with
the
soothing
movements
that
one
uses
toward
a
child
in
distress
his
great
hand
broad
and
thick
had
a
certain
sense
of
quiet
comfort
and
strength
in
it
etta
ceased
sobbing
and
sat
with
bowed
head
looking
through
her
tears
into
the
gay
wood
fire
it
is
probable
that
she
failed
to
realize
the
great
charity
of
the
man
who
was
speaking
to
her
for
the
capacity
for
evil
merges
at
some
point
or
other
into
incapability
for
comprehending
good
is
that
all
he
knows
she
was
wondering
the
suggestion
that
sydney
bamborough
was
not
dead
had
risen
up
to
eclipse
all
other
fear
in
her
mind
in
some
part
her
thought
reached
him
i
know
so
much
he
said
that
it
is
safest
to
tell
me
more
i
offered
you
my
friendship
because
i
think
that
no
woman
could
carry
through
your
difficulties
unaided
princess
the
admiration
of
claude
de
chauxville
may
be
pleasant
but
i
venture
to
think
that
my
friendship
is
essential
etta
raised
her
head
a
little
she
was
within
an
ace
of
handing
over
to
karl
steinmetz
the
rod
of
power
held
over
her
by
the
frenchman
there
was
something
in
steinmetz
that
appealed
to
her
and
softened
her
something
that
reached
a
tender
part
of
her
heart
through
the
coating
of
vanity
through
the
hardness
of
worldly
experience
i
have
known
de
chauxville
years
he
went
on
and
etta
deferred
her
confession
we
have
never
been
good
friends
i
admit
i
am
no
saint
princess
but
de
chauxville
is
a
villain
some
day
you
may
discover
when
it
is
too
late
that
it
would
have
been
for

ask
etta
shook
her
head
i
think
not
she
answered
in
a
voice
too
light
too
superficial
too
hopelessly
shallow
for
the
depth
of
the
moment
she
was
thinking
only
of
sydney

and
of
that
dread
secret
she
fought

arms
she
wielded

on
the
edge
of
the
storm
a
russian
village
kabak
with
a
smoking
lamp
of
which
the
chimney
is
broken
the
greasy
curtains
drawn
across
the
small
windows
exclude
the
faintest
possibility
of
a
draught
the
moujik
does
not
like
a
draught
in
fact
he
hates
the
fresh
air
of
heaven
air
that
has
been
breathed
three
or
four
times
over
is
the
air
for
him
it
is
warmer
the
atmosphere
of
this
particular
inn
is
not
unlike
that
of
every
other
inn
in
the
white
empire
inasmuch
as
it
is
heavily
seasoned
with
the
scent
of
cabbage
soup
the
odor
of
this
nourishing
compound
is
only
exceeded
in
unpleasantness
by
the
taste
of
the
same
added
to
this
warm
smell
there
is
the
smoke
of
a
score
of
the
very
cheapest
cigarettes
the
russian
peasant
smokes
his
cigarette
now
it
is
the
first
step
and
it
does
not
cost
him
much
it
is
the
dawn
of
progress
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
which
will
broaden
out
into
anarchy
the
poor
man
who
smokes
a
cigarette
is
sure
to
pass
on
to
socialistic
opinions
and
troubles
in
the
witness
the
countries
moreover
this
same
poor
man
is
not
a
pleasant
companion
he
smokes
a
poor
cigarette
there
is
also
the
smell
of
vodka
which
bottled
curse
is
standing
in
tumblers
all
down
the
long
table
the
news
has
spread
in
osterno
that
vodka
is
to
be
had
for
the
asking
at
the
kabak
where
there
is
a
meeting
needless
to
say
the
meeting
is
a
large
one
foolishness
and
thirst
are
often
found
in
the
same
head
a
cranium
which
by
the
way
is
exceptionally
liable
to
be
turned
by
knowledge
or
drink
if
the
drink
at
the
kabak
of
osterno
was
dangerous
the
knowledge
was
no
less
so
i
tell
you
little
fathers
an
orator
was
shouting
that
the
day
of
the
capitalist
has
gone
the
rich
men
the
princes
the
nobles
the
great
merchants
the
monopolists
the
tchinovniks
tremble
they
know
that
the
poor
man
is
awakening
at
last
from
his
long
lethargy
what
have
we
done
in
germany
what
have
we
done
in
america
what
have
we
done
in
england
and
france
whereupon
he
banged
an
unwashed
fist
upon
the
table
with
such
emphasis
that
more
than
one
of
the
audience
clutched
his
glass
of
vodka
in
alarm
lest
a
drop
of
the
precious
liquor
should
be
wasted
no
one
seemed
to
know
what
had
been
done
in
germany
in
america
in
england
or
in
france
the
people
orator
is
a
man
of
many
questions
and
much
the
moujiks
of
osterno
gazed
at
him
beneath
their
shaggy
brows
half
of
them
did
not
understand
him
they
were
as
yet
uneducated
to
a
comprehension
of
the
street
orator
periods
a
few
of
the
more
intelligent
waited
for
him
to
answer
his
own
questions
which
he
failed
to
do
a
vague
and
ominous
question
carries
as
much
weight
with
some
people
as
a
statement
and
has
the
signal
advantage
of
being
less
incriminating
the
speaker
a
neckless
ruffian
of
the
type
known
in
england
as
unemployed
looked
round
with
triumphant
head
well
thrown
back
from
his
attitude
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
been
the
salvation
of
the
countries
named
and
had
now
come
to
russia
to
do
the
same
for
her
he
spoke
with
the
throaty
accent
of
the
pole
it
was
quite
evident
that
his
speech
was
a
written
one
probably
a
printed
harangue
issued
to
him
and
his
compeers
for
circulation
throughout
the
country
he
delivered
many
of
the
longer
words
with
a
certain
unctuous
roll
of
the
tongue
and
an
emphasis
indicating
the
fact
that
he
did
not
know
their
meaning
from
afar
he
went
on
we
have
long
been
watching
you
we
have
noted
your
difficulties
and
your
hardships
your
sickness
your
starvation
men
of
tver
we
have
said
brave
and
true
and
steadfast
we
will
tell
them
of
liberty
so
i
have
come
to
you
and
i
am
glad
to
see
you
alexander
alexandrovitch
pass
the
bottle
down
the
table
you
see
little
fathers
i
have
not
come
begging
for
your
money
no
keep
your
kopecks
in
your
pocket
we
do
not
want
your
money
we
are
no
tchinovniks
we
prove
it
by
giving
you
vodka
to
keep
your
throats
wet
and
your
ears
open
fill
up
your
glasses
fill
up
your
glasses
the
little
fathers
of
osterno
understood
this
part
of
the
harangue
perfectly
and
acted
upon
it
the
orator
scratched
his
head
reflectively
there
was
a
certain
mouthing
of
his
periods
showing
that
he
had
learnt
all
this
by
heart
he
did
not
press
all
his
points
home
in
the
manner
of
one
speaking
from
his
own
brain
i
see
before
me
he
went
on
without
an
overplus
of
sequence
men
worthy
to
take
their
place
among
the
rulers
of
the
world
eh
er
rulers
of
the
world
little
fathers
he
paused
and
drank
half
a
tumbler
of
vodka
his
last
statement
was
so
obviously
inapplicable
what
he
actually
did
see
was
so
very
far
removed
from
what
he
said
he
saw
that
he
decided
to
relinquish
the
point
i
drink
he
cried
to
liberty
and
equality
some
of
the
little
fathers
also
drank
to
assuage
an
hereditary
thirst
and
now
continued
the
orator
let
us
get
to
business
i
think
we
understand
each
other
he
looked
round
with
an
engaging
smile
upon
faces
brutal
enough
to
suit
his
purpose
but
quite
devoid
of
intelligence
there
was
not
much
understanding
there
the
poor
man
has
one
only
way
of
making
himself
felt
force
we
have
worked
for
generations
we
have
toiled
in
silence
and
we
have
gathered
strength
the
time
has
now
come
for
us
to
put
forth
our
strength
the
time
has
gone
by
for
merely
asking
for
what
we
want
we
asked
and
they
heard
us
not
we
will
now
go
and
take
a
few
who
had
heard
this
speech
or
something
like
it
before
shouted
their
applause
at
this
moment
before
the
noise
had
subsided
the
door
opened
and
two
or
three
men
pushed
their
way
into
the
already
overcrowded
room
come
in
come
in
cried
the
orator
the
more
the
better
you
are
all
welcome
all
we
require
then
little
fathers
is
organization
there
are
nine
hundred
souls
in
osterno
are
you
going
to
bow
down
before
one
man
all
men
are
equal
moujik
and
bárin
krestyanin
and
prince
why
do
you
not
go
up
to
the
castle
that
frowns
down
upon
the
village
and
tell
the
man
there
that
you
are
starving
that
he
must
feed
you
that
you
are
not
going
to
work
from
dawn
till
eve
while
he
sits
on
his
velvet
couch
and
smokes
his
cigarettes
why
do
you
not
go
and
tell
him
that
you
are
not
going
to
starve
and
die
while
he
eats
caviare
and
peaches
from
gold
plates
and
dishes
a
resounding
bang
of
the
fist
finished
this
fine
oration
and
again
the
questions
were
unanswered
they
are
all
the
same
these
aristocrats
the
man
thundered
on
your
prince
is
as
the
others
i
make
no
doubt
indeed
i
know
for
i
have
been
told
by
our
good
friend
abramitch
here
a
clever
man
our
friend
abramitch
and
when
you
get
your
liberty
when
you
get
your
mir
you
must
keep
him
in
mind
your
prince
then
this
howard
alexis
treats
you
like
the
dirt
beneath
his
feet
is
it
not
so
he
will
not
listen
to
your
cry
of
hunger
he
will
not
give
you
a
few
crumbs
of
food
from
his
gold
dishes
he
will
not
give
you
a
few
kopecks
of
the
millions
of
rubles
that
he
possesses
and
where
did
he
get
those
rubles
ah
where
did
he
get
them
eh
tell
me
that
again
the
interrogative
unwashed
fist
as
the
orator
wild
and
frenzied
eye
travelled
round
the
room
it
lighted
on
a
form
near
the
door
a
man
standing
a
head
and
shoulders
above
any
one
in
the
room
a
man
enveloped
in
an
old
brown
coat
with
a
woollen
shawl
round
his
throat
hiding
half
his
face
who
is
that
cried
the
orator
with
an
unsteady
pointing
finger
he
is
no
moujik
is
that
a
tchinovnik
little
fathers
has
he
come
here
to
our
meeting
to
spy
upon
us
you
may
ask
them
who
i
am
replied
the
giant
they
know
they
will
tell
you
it
is
not
the
first
time
that
i
tell
them
they
are
fools
i
tell
them
again
now
they
are
fools
and
worse
to
listen
to
such
windbags
as
you
who
is
it
cried
the
paid
agitator
who
is
this
man
his
eyes
were
red
with
anger
and
with
vodka
his
voice
was
unsteady
his
outstretched
hand
shook
it
is
the
moscow
doctor
said
a
man
beside
him
the
moscow
doctor
then
i
say
he
is
no
doctor
shouted
the
orator
he
is
a
spy
a
government
spy
a
tchinovnik
he
has
heard
all
we
have
said
he
has
seen
you
all
brothers
that
man
must
not
leave
this
room
alive
if
he
does
you
are
lost
men
some
few
of
the
more
violent
spirits
rose
and
pressed
tumultuously
toward
the
door
the
agitator
shouted
and
screamed
urging
them
on
taking
good
care
to
remain
in
the
safe
background
himself
every
man
in
the
room
rose
to
his
feet
they
were
full
of
vodka
and
fury
and
ignorance
spirit
and
tall
talk
taken
on
an
empty
stomach
are
dangerous
stimulants
paul
stood
with
his
back
to
the
door
and
never
moved
sit
down
fools
he
cried
sit
down
listen
to
me
you
dare
not
touch
me
you
know
that
it
seemed
that
he
was
right
for
they
stopped
with
staring
stupid
eyes
and
idle
hands
will
you
listen
to
me
whom
you
have
known
for
years
or
to
this
talker
from
the
town
choose
now
i
am
tired
of
you
i
have
been
patient
with
you
for
years
you
are
sheep
are
you
fools
also
to
be
dazzled
by
the
words
of
an
idle
talker
who
promises
all
and
gives
nothing
there
was
a
sullen
silence
paul
had
lost
his
power
over
them
and
he
knew
it
he
was
quite
cool
and
watchful
he
knew
that
he
was
in
danger
these
men
were
wild
and
ignorant
they
were
mad
with
drink
and
the
brave
words
of
the
agitator
choose
now
he
shouted
feeling
for
the
handle
of
the
door
behind
his
back
they
made
no
sign
but
watched
the
faces
of
their
leaders
if
i
go
now
said
paul
i
never
come
again
he
opened
the
door
the
men
whom
he
had
nursed
and
clothed
and
fed
whose
lives
he
had
saved
again
and
again
stood
sullen
and
silent
paul
passed
slowly
out
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
without
it
was
dark
and
still
there
would
be
a
moon
presently
and
in
the
meantime
it
was
preparing
to
freeze
harder
than
ever
paul
walked
slowly
up
the
village
street
while
two
men
emerged
separately
from
the
darkness
of
and
followed
him
he
did
not
heed
them
he
was
not
aware
that
the
thermometer
stood
somewhere
below
zero
he
did
not
even
trouble
to
draw
on
his
fur
gloves
he
felt
like
a
man
whose
own
dogs
have
turned
against
him
the
place
that
these
peasants
had
occupied
in
his
heart
had
been
precisely
that
vacancy
which
is
filled
by
dogs
and
horses
in
the
hearts
of
many
men
there
was
in
his
feeling
for
them
that
knowledge
of
a
complete
dependence
by
which
young
children
draw
and
hold
a
mother
love
paul
howard
alexis
was
not
a
man
to
analyze
his
thoughts
your
strong
man
is
usually
ignorant
of
the
existence
of
his
own
feelings
he
is
never
conscious
of
them
paul
walked
slowly
through
the
village
of
osterno
and
realized
in
his
uncompromising
honesty
that
of
the
nine
hundred
men
who
lived
therein
there
were
not
three
upon
whom
he
could
rely
he
had
upheld
his
peasants
for
years
against
the
cynic
truths
of
karl
steinmetz
he
had
resolutely
refused
to
admit
even
to
himself
that
they
were
as
devoid
of
gratitude
as
they
were
of
wisdom
and
this
was
the
end
of
all
one
of
the
men
following
him
hurried
on
and
caught
him
up
excellency
he
gasped
breathless
with
his
haste
you
must
not
come
here
alone
any
longer
i
am
afraid
of
them
i
have
no
control
paul
paused
and
suited
his
pace
to
the
shorter
legs
of
his
companion
starosta
he
said
is
that
you
yes
excellency
i
saw
you
go
into
the
kabak
so
i
waited
outside
and
watched
i
did
not
dare
to
go
inside
they
will
not
allow
me
there
they
are
afraid
that
i
should
give
information
how
long
have
these
meetings
been
going
on
the
last
three
nights
excellency
in
osterno
but
it
is
the
same
all
over
the
estate
only
on
the
estate
yes
excellency
are
you
sure
of
that
yes
excellency
paul
walked
on
in
silence
for
some
paces
the
third
man
followed
them
without
catching
them
up
i
do
not
understand
excellency
said
the
starosta
anxiously
it
is
not
the
nihilists
no
it
is
not
the
nihilists
and
they
do
not
want
money
excellency
that
seems
strange
very
admitted
paul
ironically
and
they
give
vodka
this
seemed
to
be
the
chief
in
the
starosta
road
to
a
solution
of
the
mystery
find
out
for
me
said
paul
after
a
pause
who
this
man
is
where
he
comes
from
and
how
much
he
is
paid
to
open
his
mouth
we
will
pay
him
more
to
shut
it
find
out
as
much
as
you
can
and
let
me
know
i
will
try
excellency
but
i
have
little
hope
of
succeeding
they
distrust
me
they
send
the
children
to
my
shop
for
what
they
want
and
the
little
ones
have
evidently
been
told
not
to
chatter
the
moujiks
avoid
me
when
they
meet
me
what
can
i
do
you
can
show
them
that
you
are
not
afraid
of
them
answered
paul
that
goes
a
long
way
with
the
moujik
they
walked
on
together
through
the
lane
of
cottages
where
furtive
forms
lurked
in
and
behind
curtains
and
paul
had
only
one
word
of
advice
to
give
upon
which
he
harped
continually
be
thou
very
courageous
be
thou
very
courageous
nothing
new
for
so
it
was
written
in
the
oldest
book
of
all
the
starosta
was
a
timorous
man
needing
such
strong
support
as
his
master
gave
him
from
time
to
time
at
the
great
gates
of
the
park
they
paused
and
paul
gave
the
mayor
of
osterno
a
few
last
words
of
advice
while
they
were
standing
there
the
other
man
who
had
been
following
joined
them
is
that
you
steinmetz
asked
paul
his
hand
thrust
with
suspicious
speed
into
his
jacket
pocket
yes
what
are
you
doing
here
watching
you
answered
karl
steinmetz
in
his
mild
way
it
is
no
longer
safe
for
either
of
us
to
go
about
alone
it
was
mere
foolery
your
going
to
that
kabak
chapter
xxxvi
à
trois
of
all
the
rooms
in
the
great
castle
etta
liked
the
best
persons
of
a
troubled
mind
usually
love
to
look
upon
a
wide
prospect
the
mind
no
doubt
fears
the
unseen
approach
of
detection
or
danger
and
transmits
this
dread
to
the
eye
which
likes
to

a

view

around
the
great
was
only
used
after
dinner
until
that
time
the
ladies
spent
the
day
either
in
their
own
boudoirs
or
in
the
looking
over
the
cliff
here
while
the
cold
weather
lasted
etta
had
tea
served
and
thither
the
gentlemen
usually
repaired
at
the
hour
set
apart
for
the
homely
meal
they
had
come
regularly
the
last
few
evenings
paul
and
steinmetz
had
suddenly
given
up
their
long
drives
to
distant
parts
of
the
estate
here
the
whole
party
was
assembled
on
the
sunday
afternoon
following
paul
visit
to
the
village
kabak
and
to
them
came
an
unexpected
guest
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
claude
de
chauxville
pale
but
and
quiet
came
into
the
room
the
perfect
ease
of
his
manner
bespoke
a
practised
familiarity
with
the
position
difficult
his
last
parting
with
paul
and
steinmetz
had
been
to
say
the
least
of
it
strained
maggie
he
knew
disliked
and
distrusted
him
etta
hated
and
feared
him
he
was
in
riding
costume
a
short
fur
jacket
fur
gloves
a
cap
in
his
hand
and
a
crop
a
fine
figure
of
a
man
smart
well
turned
out
a
gentleman
prince
he
said
frankly
i
have
come
to
throw
myself
upon
your
generosity
will
you
lend
me
a
horse
i
was
riding
in
the
forest
when
my
horse
fell
over
a
root
and
lamed
himself
i
found
i
was
only
three
miles
from
osterno
so
i
came
my
misfortune
must
be
my
excuse
for
this
intrusion
paul
performed
graciously
enough
that
which
charity
and
politeness
demanded
of
him
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
trade
unscrupulously
upon
these
demands
but
it
is
probable
that
they
mostly
have
their
reward
love
and
friendship
are
stronger
than
charity
and
politeness
and
those
who
trade
upon
the
latter
are
rarely
accorded
the
former
so
paul
ignored
the
probability
that
de
chauxville
had
lamed
his
horse
on
purpose
and
offered
him
refreshment
while
his
saddle
was
being
transferred
to
the
back
of
a
fresh
mount
farther
than
that
he
did
not
go
he
did
not
consider
himself
called
upon
to
offer
a
hospitality
to
the
man
who
had
attempted
to
murder
him
a
week
before
with
engaging
frankness
de
chauxville
accepted
every
thing
it
is
an
art
soon
acquired
and
soon
abused
there
is
something
honest
in
an
ungracious
acceptance
of
favors
steinmetz
suggested
that
perhaps
de
chauxville
had
lunched
sparsely
and
the
frenchman
admitted
that
such
was
the
case
but
that
he
loved
afternoon
tea
above
all
meals
it
is
so
innocent
and
simple
i
know
i
have
the
same
feeling
myself
concurred
steinmetz
courteously
do
you
ride
about
the
country
much
alone
asked
paul
while
the
servants
were
setting
before
this
uninvited
guest
a
few
more
substantial
delicacies
ah
no
prince
this
is
my
first
attempt
and
if
it
had
not
procured
me
this
pleasure
i
should
say
that
it
will
be
my
last
it
is
easy
to
lose
yourself
said
paul
besides
and
the
two
friends
watched
the
frenchman
face
closely
besides
the
country
is
disturbed
at
present
de
chauxville
was
helping
himself
daintily
to
pâté
de
foie
gras
ah
indeed
is
that
so
he
answered
but
they
would
not
hurt
me
a
stranger
in
the
land
and
an
orphan
too
i
have
no
doubt
added
steinmetz
with
a
laugh
but
would
the
moujik
pause
to
enquire
my
very
dear
de
chauxville
at
all
events
i
should
not
pause
to
answer
replied
the
frenchman
in
the
same
light
tone
i
should
evacuate
ah
mademoiselle
he
went
on
addressing
maggie
they
have
been
attempting
to
frighten
you
i
suspect
with
their
stories
of
disturbed
peasantry
it
is
to
keep
up
the
lurid
local
color
they
must
have
their
romance
these
russians
and
so
the
ball
was
kept
rolling
there
was
never
any
lack
of
conversation
when
steinmetz
and
de
chauxville
were
together
nor
was
the
talk
without
of
acidity
at
length
the
centre
of
attention
himself
diverted
that
attention
he
inaugurated
an
argument
over
the
best
route
from
osterno
to
thors
which
sent
steinmetz
out
of
the
room
for
a
map
during
the
absence
of
the
watchful
german
he
admired
the
view
from
the
window
and
this
strategetic
movement
enabled
him
to
say
to
etta
aside
i
must
see
you
before
i
leave
the
house
it
is
absolutely
necessary
not
long
after
the
return
of
steinmetz
and
the
final
decision
respecting
the
road
to
thors
etta
left
the
room
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
servant
announced
that
the
baron
horse
was
at
the
door
de
chauxville
took
his
leave
at
once
with
many
assurances
of
lasting
gratitude
kindly
he
added
make
my
adieux
to
the
princess
i
will
not
trouble
her
quite
by
accident
he
met
etta
at
the
head
of
the
state
staircase
and
expressed
such
admiration
for
the
castle
that
she
opened
the
door
of
the
large
and
took
him
to
see
that
apartment
what
i
arranged
for
thursday
is
for
the
day
after
tuesday
said
de
chauxville
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
we
can
not
keep
them
back
any
longer
you
understand
the
side
door
to
be
opened
at
seven
ah
who
is
this
they
both
turned
steinmetz
was
standing
behind
them
but
he
could
not
have
heard
de
chauxville
words
he
closed
the
door
carefully
and
came
forward
with
his
grim
smile
à
nous
trois
he
said
and
the
subsequent
conversation
was
in
the
language
in
which
these
three
understood
each
other
best
de
chauxville
bit
his
lip
and
waited
it
was
a
moment
of
the
tensest
suspense
à
nous
trois
repeated
steinmetz
de
chauxville
you
love
an
epigram
the
man
who
overestimates
the
foolishness
of
others
is
himself
the
biggest
fool
concerned
a
lame
horse
the
prince
generosity
making
your
adieux
mon
dieu
you
should
know
me
better
than
that
after
all
these
years
no
you
need
not
look
at
the
door
no
one
will
interrupt
us
i
have
seen
to
that
his
attitude
and
manner
indicated
a
complete
mastery
of
the
situation
but
whether
this
assumption
was
justified
by
fact
or
was
a
mere
trick
it
was
impossible
to
say
there
was
in
the
man
something
strong
and
good
and
calm
a
manner
never
acquired
by
one
who
has
anything
to
conceal
his
dignity
was
perfect
one
forgot
his
stoutness
his
heavy
breathing
his
ungainly
size
he
was
essentially
manly
and
a
presence
to
be
feared
the
strength
of
his
will
made
itself
felt
he
turned
to
the
princess
with
the
grave
courtesy
that
always
marked
his
attitude
toward
her
madame
he
said
i
fully
recognize
your
cleverness
in
raising
yourself
to
the
position
you
now
occupy
but
i
would
remind
you
that
that
position
carries
with
it
certain
obligations
it
is
hardly
dignified
for
a
princess
to
engage
herself
in
a
vulgar
love
intrigue
in
her
own
house
it
is
not
a
vulgar
love
intrigue
cried
etta
with
blazing
eyes
i
will
not
allow
you
to
say
that
where
is
your
boasted
friendship
is
this
a
sample
of
it
karl
steinmetz
bowed
gravely
with
outspread
hands
madame
that
friendship
is
at
your
service
now
as
always
de
chauxville
gave
a
scornful
little
laugh
he
was
biting
the
end
of
his
mustache
as
he
watched
etta
face
for
a
moment
the
woman
stood
not
the
first
woman
to
stand
thus
between
two
fears
then
she
turned
to
steinmetz
the
victory
was
his
the
greatest
he
had
ever
torn
from
the
grasp
of
claude
de
chauxville
you
know
she
said
that
this
man
has
me
in
his
power
you
alone
but
not
both
of
us
together
answered
steinmetz
de
chauxville
looked
uneasy
he
gave
a
careless
little
laugh
my
good
steinmetz
you
allow
your
imagination
to
run
away
with
you
you
interfere
in
what
does
not
concern
you
my
very
dear
de
chauxville
i
think
not
at
all
events
i
am
going
to
continue
to
interfere
etta
looked
from
one
to
the
other
she
had
at
the
first
impulse
gone
over
to
steinmetz
she
was
now
meditating
drawing
back
if
de
chauxville
kept
cool
all
might
yet
be
well
the
dread
secret
of
the
probability
of
sydney
bamborough
being
alive
might
still
be
withheld
from
steinmetz
for
the
moment
it
would
appear
that
she
was
about
to
occupy
the
ignominious
position
of
the
bone
of
contention
if
these
two
men
were
going
to
use
her
as
a
mere
excuse
to
settle
a
lifelong
quarrel
of
many
issues
it
was
probable
that
there
would
not
be
much
left
of
her
character
by
the
time
that
they
had
finished
she
had
to
decide
quickly
she
decided
to
assume
the
role
of
peacemaker
de
chauxville
was
on
the
point
of
going
she
said
let
him
go
de
chauxville
is
not
going
until
i
have
finished
with
him
madame
this
may
be
the
last
time
we
meet
i
hope
it
is
de
chauxville
looked
uneasy
his
was
a
ready
wit
and
fear
was
the
only
feeling
that
paralyzed
it
etta
looked
at
him
was
his
wit
going
to
desert
him
now
when
he
most
needed
it
he
had
ridden
boldly
into
the
lion
den
such
a
proceeding
requires
a
certain
courage
but
a
higher
form
of
intrepidity
is
required
to
face
the
lion
standing
before
the
exit
de
chauxville
looked
at
steinmetz
with
shifty
eyes
he
was
very
like
the
mask
of
the
lynx
in
the
even
to
the
deprecatory
smile
on
the
countenance
of
the
forest
sneak
keep
your
temper
he
said
do
not
let
us
quarrel
in
the
presence
of
a
lady
no
we
will
keep
the
quarrel
till
afterward
steinmetz
turned
to
etta
princess
he
said
will
you
now
in
my
presence
forbid
this
man
to
come
to
this
or
any
other
house
of
yours
will
you
forbid
him
to
address
himself
either
by
speech
or
letter
to
you
again
you
know
i
can
not
do
that
replied
etta
why
not
etta
made
no
answer
because
replied
de
chauxville
for
her
the
princess
is
too
wise
to
make
an
enemy
of
me
in
that
respect
she
is
wiser
than
you
she
knows
that
i
could
send
you
and
your
prince
to
siberia
steinmetz
laughed
nonsense
he
said
princess
he
went
on
if
you
think
that
the
fact
of
de
chauxville
numbering
among
his
friends
a
few
obscure
police
spies
gives
him
the
right
to
persecute
you
you
are
mistaken
our
friend
is
very
clever
but
he
can
do
no
harm
with
the
little
that
he
knows
of
the
charity
league
etta
remained
silent
the
silence
made
steinmetz
frown
princess
he
said
gravely
you
were
indignant
just
now
because
i
made
so
bold
as
to
put
the
most
natural
construction
upon
the
circumstances
in
which
i
found
you
it
was
a
prearranged
meeting
between
de
chauxville
and
yourself
if
the
meeting
was
not
the
outcome
of
an
intrigue
such
as
i
mentioned
nor
the
result
of
this
man
hold
over
you
on
account
of
the
charity
league
what
was
it
i
beg
of
you
to
answer
etta
made
no
reply
instead
she
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
at
de
chauxville
without
going
into
affairs
which
do
not
concern
you
said
the
frenchman
answering
for
her
i
think
you
will
recognize
that
the
secret
of
the
charity
league
was
quite
sufficient
excuse
for
me
to
request
a
few
minutes
alone
with
the
princess
of
this
steinmetz
took
no
notice
he
was
standing
in
front
of
etta
between
de
chauxville
and
the
door
his
broad
deeply
lined
face
was
flushed
with
the
excitement
of
the
moment
his
great
mournful
eyes
yellow
and
drawn
with
much
reading
and
the
hardships
of
a
rigorous
climate
were
fixed
anxiously
on
her
face
etta
was
not
looking
at
him
her
eyes
were
turned
toward
the
window
but
they
did
not
see
with
comprehension
she
was
stony
and
stubborn
princess
said
steinmetz
answer
me
before
it
is
too
late
has
de
chauxville
any
other
hold
over
you
etta
nodded
and
the
little
action
brought
a
sudden
gleam
to
the
frenchman
eyes
if
said
steinmetz
looking
from
one
to
the
other
if
you
two
have
been
deceiving
paul
i
will
have
no
mercy
i
warn
you
of
that
etta
turned
on
him
can
you
not
believe
me
she
cried
i
have
practised
no
deception
in
common
with
de
chauxville
the
charity
league
is
quite
enough
for
you
my
friend
put
in
the
frenchman
hurriedly
you
know
no
more
of
the
charity
league
than
you
did
before
than
the
whole
world
knew
before
except
this
lady
share
in
the
disposal
of
the
papers
said
steinmetz
and
this
lady
share
in
the
disposal
of
the
papers
will
not
be
welcome
news
to
the
prince
answered
de
chauxville
welcome
or
unwelcome
he
shall
be
told
of
it
etta
looked
round
sharply
her
lips
apart
and
trembling
by
whom
asked
de
chauxville
by
me
replied
steinmetz
there
was
a
momentary
pause
de
chauxville
and
etta
exchanged
a
glance
etta
felt
that
she
was
lost
this
frenchman
was
not
one
to
spare
either
man
or
woman
from
any
motive
of
charity
or
chivalry
even
if
that
is
so
he
said
the
princess
is
not
relieved
from
the
embarrassment
of
her
situation
no
no
my
astute
friend
there
is
a
little
matter
connected
with
sydney
bamborough
which
has
come
to
my
knowledge
etta
moved
but
she
said
nothing
the
sound
of
her
breathing
was
startlingly
loud
ah
sydney
bamborough
said
steinmetz
slowly
what
about
him
he
is
not
dead
that
is
all
karl
steinmetz
passed
his
broad
hand
down
over
his
face
covering
his
mouth
for
a
second
but
he
died
he
was
found
on
the
steppe
and
buried
at
tver
so
the
story
runs
said
de
chauxville
with
easy
sarcasm
but
who
found
him
on
the
steppe
who
buried
him
at
tver
i
did
my
friend
the
next
second
steinmetz
staggered
back
a
step
or
two
as
etta
fell
heavily
into
his
arms
but
he
never
took
his
eyes
off
de
chauxville
chapter
xxxvii
à
deux
steinmetz
laid
etta
on
a
sofa
she
was
already
recovering
consciousness
he
rang
the
bell
twice
and
all
the
while
he
kept
his
eye
on
de
chauxville
a
quick
touch
on
etta
wrist
and
breast
showed
that
this
man
knew
something
of
women
and
of
those
fainting
fits
that
belong
to
strong
emotions
the
maid
soon
came
the
princess
requires
your
attention
said
steinmetz
still
watching
de
chauxville
who
was
looking
at
etta
and
neglecting
his
opportunities
steinmetz
went
up
to
him
and
took
him
by
the
arm
come
with
me
he
said
the
frenchman
could
have
taken
advantage
of
the
presence
of
the
servant
to
effect
a
retreat
but
he
did
not
dare
to
do
so
it
was
essential
that
he
should
obtain
a
few
words
with
etta
to
effect
this
he
was
ready
even
to
face
an
interview
with
steinmetz
in
his
heart
he
was
cursing
that
liability
to
inconvenient
fainting
fits
that
make
all
women
unreliable
in
a
moment
of
need
he
preceded
steinmetz
out
of
the
room
forgetting
even
to
resent
the
large
warm
grasp
on
his
arm
they
went
through
the
long
dimly
lit
passage
to
the
old
part
of
the
castle
where
steinmetz
had
his
rooms
and
now
said
steinmetz
when
they
were
alone
with
closed
doors
and
now
de
chauxville
let
us
understand
each
other
de
chauxville
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
was
not
thinking
of
steinmetz
yet
he
was
still
thinking
of
etta
and
how
he
could
get
speech
with
her
with
the
assurance
which
had
carried
him
through
many
a
difficulty
before
this
the
frenchman
looked
round
him
taking
in
the
details
of
the
room
they
were
in
the
apartment
beyond
the
large
smoking
room
the
as
it
were
to
the
little
chamber
where
paul
kept
his
his
disguise
all
the
compromising
details
of
his
work
among
the
peasants
the
broad
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
between
the
two
men
do
you
imagine
yourself
in
love
with
the
princess
asked
steinmetz
suddenly
with
characteristic
bluntness
if
you
like
returned
the
other
if
i
thought
that
it
was
that
said
the
german
looking
at
him
thoughtfully
i
would
throw
you
out
of
the
window
if
it
is
any
thing
else
i
will
only
throw
you
down
stairs
de
chauxville
bit
his
anxiously
he
frowned
across
the
table
into
steinmetz
face
in
all
their
intercourse
he
had
never
heard
that
tone
of
voice
he
had
never
seen
quite
that
look
on
the
heavy
face
was
steinmetz
aroused
at
last
steinmetz
aroused
was
an
unknown
quantity
to
claude
de
chauxville
i
have
known
you
now
for
years
went
on
karl
steinmetz
and
i
can
not
say
that
i
know
any
good
of
you
but
let
that
pass
it
is
not
i
suppose
my
business
the
world
is
as
the
good
god
made
it
i
can
do
nothing
toward
bettering
it
i
have
always
known
you
to
be
a
scoundrel
a
fact
to
be
deplored
and
that
is
all
but
so
soon
as
your
villany
affects
my
own
life
then
my
friend
a
more
active
recognition
of
it
is
necessary
indeed
sneered
the
frenchman
your
villany
has
touched
paul
life
and
at
that
point
it
touches
mine
continued
karl
steinmetz
with
slow
anger
you
followed
us
to
petersburg
thence
you
dogged
us
to
the
government
of
tver
you
twisted
that
foolish
woman
the
countess
lanovitch
round
your
finger
and
obtained
from
her
an
invitation
to
thors
all
this
in
order
to
be
near
one
of
us
ach
i
have
been
watching
you
is
it
only
after
years
that
i
at
last
convince
you
that
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
you
are
pleased
to
consider
me
you
have
not
convinced
me
yet
put
in
de
chauxville
with
his
easy
laugh
no
but
i
shall
do
so
before
i
have
finished
with
you
now
you
have
not
come
here
for
nothing
it
is
to
be
near
one
of
us
it
is
not
miss
delafield
she
knows
you
some
women
good
women
have
an
instinct
given
to
them
by
god
for
a
defence
against
such
men
such
things
as
you
is
it
i
he
touched
his
broad
chest
with
his
two
hands
and
stood
defying
his
foe
is
it
me
that
you
follow
if
so
i
am
here
let
us
have
done
with
it
now
de
chauxville
laughed
there
was
an
uneasy
look
in
his
eyes
he
did
not
quite
understand
steinmetz
he
made
no
answer
but
he
turned
and
looked
at
the
window
it
is
possible
that
he
suddenly
remembered
the
threat
concerning
it
is
it
paul
continued
steinmetz
i
think
not
i
think
you
are
afraid
of
paul
remains
the
princess
unless
you
can
convince
me
to
the
contrary
i
must
conclude
that
you
are
trying
to
get
a
helpless
woman
into
your
power
you
always
were
a
champion
of
helpless
ladies
sneered
de
chauxville
ah
you
remember
that
do
you
i
also
i
remember
it
it
is
long
ago
and
i
have
forgiven
you
but
i
have
not
forgotten
what
you
were
then
you
will
be
now
your
record
is
against
you
steinmetz
was
standing
with
his
back
to
what
appeared
to
be
the
only
exit
from
the
room
there
were
two
other
doors
concealed
in
the
oaken
panels
but
de
chauxville
did
not
know
that
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
the
broad
face
of
his
companion
upon
which
there
were
singular
blotches
of
color
i
am
waiting
said
the
german
for
you
to
explain
your
conduct
indeed
replied
de
chauxville
then
my
friend
you
will
have
to
continue
waiting
i
fail
to
recognize
your
right
to
make
enquiry
into
my
movements
i
am
not
responsible
to
any
man
for
my
actions
least
of
all
to
you
the
man
who
manages
his
neighbor
affairs
mismanages
his
own
i
would
recommend
you
to
mind
your
own
business
kindly
let
me
pass
de
chauxville
words
were
brave
enough
but
his
lips
were
unsteady
a
weak
mouth
is
apt
to
betray
its
possessor
at
inconvenient
moments
he
waved
steinmetz
aside
but
he
made
no
movement
toward
the
door
he
kept
the
table
between
him
and
his
companion
steinmetz
was
getting
calmer
there
was
an
uncanny
hush
about
him
then
i
am
to
conclude
he
said
that
you
came
to
russia
in
order
to
persecute
a
helpless
woman
her
innocence
or
her
guilt
is
for
the
moment
beside
the
question
neither
is
any
business
of
yours
both
on
the
contrary
are
my
affair
innocent
or
guilty
the
princess
howard
alexis
must
from
this
moment
be
freed
from
your
persecution
de
chauxville
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
tapped
on
the
floor
impatiently
with
the
toe
of
his
neat
allons
he
said
let
me
pass
your
story
of
sydney
bamborough
went
on
steinmetz
coldly
was
a
good
one
wherewith
to
frighten
a
woman
but
you
brought
it
to
the
wrong
person
when
you
brought
it
to
me
do
you
suppose
that
i
would
have
allowed
the
marriage
to
take
place
unless
i
knew
that
bamborough
was
dead
you
may
be
telling
the
truth
about
that
incident
or
you
may
not
said
de
chauxville
but
my
knowledge
of
the
betrayal
of
the
charity
league
is
sufficient
for
my
purpose
yes
admitted
steinmetz
grimly
you
have
information
there
with
possibilities
of
mischief
in
it
but
i
shall
discount
most
of
it
by
telling
prince
pavlo
all
that
i
know
and
i
know
more
than
you
do
also
i
intend
to
seal
your
lips
before
you
leave
this
room
de
chauxville
stared
at
him
with
a
dropping
lip
he
gulped
down
something
in
his
throat
his
hand
was
stealing
round
under
the
fur
jacket
to
a
pocket
at
the
back
of
his
trousers
let
me
out
he
hissed
there
was
a
gleam
of
bright
metal
in
the
sunlight
that
poured
in
through
the
window
de
chauxville
raised
his
arm
sharply
and
at
the
same
instant
steinmetz
threw
a
book
in
his
face
a
loud
report
and
the
room
was
full
of
smoke
steinmetz
placed
one
hand
on
the
table
and
despite
his
weight
vaulted
it
cleanly
this
man
had
taken
his
degree
at
heidelberg
and
the
germans
are
the
finest
gymnasts
in
the
world
moreover
muscle
once
made
remains
till
death
it
was
his
only
chance
for
the
frenchman
had
dodged
the
novel
but
it
spoiled
his
aim
steinmetz
vaulted
right
on
to
him
and
de
chauxville
staggered
back
in
a
moment
steinmetz
had
him
by
the
collar
his
face
was
gray
his
heavy
eyes
ablaze
if
any
thing
will
rouse
a
man
it
is
being
fired
at
at
a
range
of
four
yards
with
a
revolver
ach
gasped
the
german
you
would
shoot
me
would
you
he
wrenched
the
pistol
from
de
chauxville
fingers
and
threw
it
into
the
corner
of
the
room
then
he
shook
the
man
like
a
garment
first
he
cried
you
would
kill
paul
and
now
you
try
to
shoot
me
good
god
what
are
you
you
are
no
man
do
you
know
what
i
am
going
to
do
with
you
i
am
going
to
thrash
you
like
a
dog
he
dragged
him
to
the
above
the
mantelpiece
a
was
affixed
to
the
wall
and
here
were
sticks
and
steinmetz
selected
a
heavy
whip
his
eyes
were
shot
with
blood
his
mouth
worked
beneath
his
mustache
so
he
said
i
am
going
to
settle
with
you
at
last
de
chauxville
kicked
and
struggled
but
he
could
not
get
free
he
only
succeeded
in
half
choking
himself
you
are
going
to
swear
said
steinmetz
never
to
approach
the
princess
again
never
to
divulge
what
you
know
of
her
past
life
the
frenchman
was
almost
blue
in
the
face
his
eyes
were
wild
with
terror
and
karl
steinmetz
thrashed
him
it
did
not
last
long
no
word
was
spoken
the
silence
was
only
broken
by
their
shuffling
feet
by
the
startling
report
of
each
blow
by
de
chauxville
repeated
gasps
of
pain
the
fur
jacket
was
torn
in
several
places
the
white
shirt
appeared
here
and
there
in
one
place
it
was
stained
with
red
at
last
steinmetz
threw
him
huddled
into
one
corner
of
the
room
the
chattering
face
the
wild
eyes
that
looked
up
at
him
were
terrible
to
see
when
you
have
promised
to
keep
the
secret
you
may
go
said
steinmetz
you
must
swear
it
de
chauxville
lips
moved
but
no
sound
came
from
them
steinmetz
poured
some
water
into
a
tumbler
and
gave
it
to
him
it
had
to
come
to
this
he
said
sooner
or
later
paul
would
have
killed
you
that
is
the
only
difference
do
you
swear
by
god
in
heaven
above
you
that
you
will
keep
the
princess
secret
i
swear
it
answered
de
chauxville
hoarsely
steinmetz
was
holding
on
to
the
back
of
a
high
chair
with
both
hands
breathing
heavily
his
face
was
still
livid
that
which
had
been
white
in
his
eyes
was
quite
red
de
chauxville
was
crawling
toward
the
revolver
in
the
corner
of
the
room
but
he
was
almost
fainting
it
was
a
question
whether
he
would
last
long
enough
to
reach
the
there
was
a
bright
patch
of
red
in
either
cheek
his
lips
were
working
convulsively
and
steinmetz
saw
him
in
time
he
seized
him
by
the
collar
of
his
coat
and
dragged
him
back
he
placed
his
foot
on
the
little
pistol
and
faced
de
chauxville
with
glaring
eyes
de
chauxville
rose
to
his
feet
and
for
a
moment
the
two
men
looked
into
each
other
souls
the
frenchman
face
was
twisted
with
pain
no
word
was
said
such
was
the
last
reckoning
between
karl
steinmetz
and
the
baron
claude
de
chauxville
the
frenchman
went
slowly
toward
the
door
he
faltered
and
looked
round
for
a
chair
he
sat
heavily
down
with
a
little
exclamation
of
pain
and
exhaustion
and
felt
for
his
the
scented
cambric
diffused
a
faint
dainty
odor
of
violets
he
sat
forward
with
his
two
hands
on
his
knees
swaying
a
little
from
side
to
side
presently
he
raised
his
handkerchief
to
his
face
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
thus
the
two
men
waited
until
de
chauxville
had
recovered
himself
sufficiently
to
take
his
departure
the
air
was
full
of
naked
human
passions
it
was
rather
a
grewsome
scene
at
last
the
frenchman
stood
slowly
up
and
with
characteristic
thought
of
appearances
fingered
his
torn
coat
have
you
a
cloak
asked
steinmetz
no
the
german
went
to
a
cupboard
in
the
wall
and
selected
a
long
which
he
handed
to
the
frenchman
without
a
word
thus
claude
de
chauxville
walked
to
the
door
in
a
cloak
which
had
figured
at
many
a
charity
league
meeting
assuredly
the
irony
of
fate
is
a
keener
thing
than
any
poor
humor
we
have
at
our
command
when
evil
is
punished
in
this
present
life
there
is
no
staying
of
the
hand
steinmetz
followed
de
chauxville
through
the
long
passage
they
had
traversed
a
few
minutes
earlier
and
down
the
broad
staircase
the
servants
were
waiting
at
the
door
with
the
horse
put
at
the
disposal
by
paul
de
chauxville
mounted
slowly
heavily
with
twitching
lips
his
face
was
set
and
cold
now
the
pain
was
getting
bearable
the
wounded
vanity
was
bleeding
inwardly
in
his
dull
eyes
there
was
a
gleam
of
hatred
and
malice
it
was
the
face
of
a
man
rejoicing
inwardly
over
a
deep
and
certain
vengeance
it
is
well
he
was
muttering
between
his
clenched
teeth
as
he
rode
away
while
steinmetz
watched
him
from
the
doorstep
it
is
well
now
i
will
not
spare
you
he
rode
down
the
hill
and
through
the
village
with
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
shining
on
a
face
where
pain
and
deadly
rage
were
fighting
for
the
mastery
chapter
xxxviii
a
tale
that
is
told
karl
steinmetz
walked
slowly
upstairs
to
his
own
room
the
evening
sun
shining
through
the
small
deeply
embrasured
windows
fell
on
a
face
at
no
time
joyous
now
tired
and
worn
he
sat
down
at
his
broad
and
looked
round
the
room
with
a
little
blink
of
the
eyelids
i
am
getting
too
old
for
this
sort
of
thing
he
said
his
gaze
lighted
on
the
heavy
thrown
on
the
ground
near
the
door
where
he
had
released
claude
de
chauxville
after
the
terrible
punishment
meted
out
to
that
foe
with
heavy
teutonic
hand
steinmetz
rose
and
picking
up
the
whip
with
the
grunt
of
a
stout
man
stooping
replaced
it
carefully
in
the
rack
over
the
mantelpiece
he
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
for
a
few
moments
it
will
have
to
be
done
he
said
resolutely
and
rang
the
bell
my
compliments
to
the
prince
he
said
to
his
servant
who
appeared
instantly
and
will
he
come
to
me
here
when
paul
came
into
the
room
a
few
minutes
later
steinmetz
was
standing
by
the
fire
he
turned
and
looked
gravely
at
the
prince
i
have
just
kicked
de
chauxville
out
of
the
house
he
said
the
color
left
paul
face
quite
suddenly
why
he
asked
with
hard
eyes
he
had
begun
to
distrust
etta
and
there
is
nothing
so
hard
to
stop
as
the
growth
of
distrust
steinmetz
did
not
answer
at
once
was
it
not
privilege
asked
paul
with
a
grim
smile
there
are
some
smiles
more
terrible
than
any
frown
no
answered
steinmetz
i
think
not
it
is
not
as
bad
as
that
but
it
is
bad
enough
mein
lieber
it
is
bad
enough
i
horsewhipped
him
first
for
myself
gott
how
pleasant
that
was
and
then
i
kicked
him
out
for
you
why
repeated
paul
with
a
white
face
it
is
a
long
story
answered
steinmetz
without
looking
at
him
he
knows
too
much
about
whom
about
all
of
us
paul
walked
away
to
the
window
he
stood
looking
out
his
hands
thrust
into
the
of
his
jacket
his
broad
back
turned
uncompromisingly
upon
his
companion
tell
me
the
story
he
said
you
need
not
hurry
over
it
you
need
not
trouble
to
spare
me
only
let
it
be
quite
complete
once
for
all
steinmetz
winced
he
knew
the
expression
of
the
face
that
was
looking
out
of
the
window
this
man
has
hated
me
all
his
life
he
said
it
began
as
such
things
usually
do
between
men
about
a
woman
it
was
years
ago
i
got
the
better
of
him
and
the
good
god
got
the
better
of
me
she
died
and
de
chauxville
forgot
her
i
have
not
forgotten
her
but
i
have
tried
to
do
so
it
is
a
slow
process
and
i
have
made
very
little
progress
but
all
that
is
my
affair
and
beside
the
question
i
merely
mention
it
to
show
you
that
de
chauxville
had
a
grudge
against
me
this
is
no
time
for
mistaken
charity
interrupted
paul
do
not
try
to
screen
any
body
i
shall
see
through
it
there
was
a
little
pause
never
had
that
silent
room
been
so
noiseless
in
steinmetz
went
on
it
was
our
fate
to
be
at
variance
several
times
our
mutual
dislike
has
had
no
opportunity
of
diminishing
it
seems
that
before
you
married
de
chauxville
was
pleased
to
consider
himself
in
love
with
sydney
bamborough
whether
he
had
any
right
to
think
himself
i
do
not
know
such
matters
are
usually
known
to
two
persons
only
and
imperfectly
by
them
it
would
appear
that
the
wound
to
his
vanity
was
serious
it
developed
into
a
thirst
for
revenge
he
looked
about
for
some
means
to
do
you
harm
he
communicated
with
your
enemies
and
allied
himself
to
such
men
as
vassili
of
paris
he
followed
us
to
petersburg
and
then
he
had
a
stroke
of
good
fortune
he
found
out
who
betrayed
the
charity
league
paul
turned
slowly
round
in
his
eyes
there
burned
a
dull
hungering
fire
men
have
seen
such
a
look
in
the
eyes
of
a
beast
of
prey
driven
famished
cornered
at
last
and
at
last
face
to
face
with
its
foe
ah
he
knows
that
he
said
slowly
yes
god
help
us
he
knows
that
and
who
was
it
steinmetz
moved
uneasily
from
one
foot
to
the
other
it
was
a
woman
he
said
a
woman
a
woman
you
know
said
steinmetz
slowly
good
god
catrina
no
not
catrina
then
who
cried
paul
hoarsely
his
hands
fell
heavily
on
the
table
your
wife
paul
knew
before
the
words
were
spoken
he
turned
again
and
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
with
his
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
he
stood
there
for
whole
minutes
in
an
awful
stillness
the
clock
on
the
a
little
travelling
timepiece
ticked
in
a
hurried
way
as
if
anxious
to
get
on
down
beneath
them
somewhere
in
the
courtyards
of
the
great
castle
a
dog
a
was
baying
persistently
and
nervously
listening
for
the
echo
of
its
own
voice
amid
the
pines
of
the
desert
forest
steinmetz
watched
paul
motionless
back
with
a
sort
of
fascination
he
moved
uneasily
as
if
to
break
a
spell
of
silence
almost
unbearable
in
its
intensity
he
went
to
the
table
and
sat
down
from
mere
habit
he
took
up
a
quill
pen
he
looked
at
the
point
of
it
and
at
the
inkstand
but
he
had
nothing
to
write
there
was
nothing
to
say
he
laid
the
pen
aside
and
sat
leaning
his
broad
head
upon
the
palm
of
his
hand
his
two
elbows
on
the
table
paul
never
moved
steinmetz
waited
his
own
life
had
been
no
great
success
he
had
had
much
to
bear
and
he
had
borne
it
he
was
wondering
heavily
whether
any
of
it
had
been
as
bad
as
what
paul
was
bearing
now
while
he
looked
out
of
the
window
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
saying
nothing
at
length
paul
moved
he
turned
and
coming
toward
the
table
laid
his
hand
on
steinmetz
broad
shoulder
are
you
sure
of
it
he
asked
in
a
voice
that
did
not
sound
like
his
own
at
all
a
hollow
voice
like
that
of
an
old
man
quite
i
have
it
from
stépan
lanovitch
from
the
princess
herself
they
remained
thus
for
a
moment
then
paul
withdrew
his
hand
and
walked
slowly
to
the
window
tell
me
he
said
how
she
did
it
steinmetz
was
playing
with
the
quill
pen
again
it
is
singular
how
at
great
moments
we
perform
trivial
acts
think
trivial
thoughts
he
dipped
the
pen
in
the
ink
and
made
a
pattern
on
the
with
dots
it
was
an
organized
plan
between
husband
and
wife
he
said
bamborough
turned
up
at
thors
and
asked
for
a
night
lodging
on
the
strength
of
a
very
small
acquaintance
he
stole
the
papers
from
study
and
took
them
to
tver
where
his
wife
was
waiting
for
them
she
took
them
on
to
paris
and
sold
them
to
vassili
bamborough
began
his
journey
eastward
knowing
presumably
that
he
could
not
escape
by
the
western
frontier
but
lost
his
way
on
the
steppe
you
remember
the
man
whom
we
picked
up
between
here
and
tver
with
his
face
all
cut
to
pieces
he
had
been
dragged
by
the
stirrup
that
was
sydney
bamborough
the
good
god
had
hit
back
quickly
how
long
have
you
known
this
asked
paul
in
a
queer
voice
i
saw
it
suddenly
in
the
princess
face
one
day
in
petersburg
a
sort
of
revelation
i
read
it
there
and
she
saw
me
reading
i
should
have
liked
to
keep
it
from
you
for
your
sake
as
well
as
for
hers
our
daily
life
is
made
possible
only
by
the
fact
that
we
know
so
little
of
our
neighbors
there
are
many
things
of
which
we
are
better
ignorant
right
up
to
the
end
this
might
have
been
one
of
them
but
de
chauxville
found
it
out
and
it
is
better
that
i
should
tell
you
than
he
paul
did
not
look
around
the
was
still
barking
at
its
own
echo
a
favorite
pastime
of
those
who
make
a
great
local
stir
in
the
world
of
course
said
paul
after
a
long
pause
i
have
been
a
great
fool
i
know
that
but
he
turned
and
looked
at
steinmetz
with
haggard
eyes
but
i
would
rather
go
on
being
a
fool
than
suspect
any
one
of
a
deception
like
this
steinmetz
was
still
making
patterns
on
the
it
is
difficult
for
us
men
he
said
slowly
to
look
at
these
things
from
a
woman
point
of
view
they
hold
a
different
sense
of
honor
from
ours
especially
if
they
are
beautiful
and
the
fault
is
ours
especially
toward
the
beautiful
ones
there
may
have
been
temptations
of
which
we
are
ignorant
paul
was
still
looking
at
him
steinmetz
looked
up
slowly
and
saw
that
he
had
grown
ten
years
older
in
the
last
few
minutes
he
did
not
look
at
him
for
more
than
a
second
because
the
sight
of
paul
face
hurt
him
but
he
saw
in
that
moment
that
paul
did
not
understand
this
strong
man
hard
in
his
youthful
strength
of
limb
and
purpose
would
be
just
but
nothing
more
and
between
man
and
man
it
is
not
always
justice
that
is
required
between
man
and
woman
justice
rarely
meets
the
difficulty
comprendre
pardonner
quoted
steinmetz
vaguely
he
hesitated
to
interfere
between
paul
and
his
wife
axioms
are
made
for
crucial
moments
a
man
life
has
been
steered
by
a
proverb
before
this
some
who
have
no
religion
steer
by
them
all
the
voyage
paul
walked
slowly
to
the
chair
he
usually
occupied
opposite
to
steinmetz
at
the
he
walked
and
sat
down
as
if
he
had
travelled
a
long
distance
what
is
to
be
done
asked
steinmetz
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
think
that
it
matters
much
what
do
you
recommend
there
is
so
much
to
be
done
answered
steinmetz
that
it
is
difficult
to
know
what
to
do
first
we
must
not
forget
that
de
chauxville
is
furious
he
will
do
all
the
harm
of
which
he
is
capable
at
once
we
must
not
forget
that
the
country
is
in
a
state
of
smoldering
revolt
and
that
we
have
two
women
two
english
ladies
entrusted
to
our
care
paul
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
his
companion
had
struck
the
right
note
this
large
man
was
happiest
when
he
was
tiring
himself
out
yes
but
about
etta
he
said
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
made
steinmetz
wince
there
is
nothing
so
heartrending
as
the
sight
of
dumb
suffering
you
must
see
her
answered
he
reflectively
you
must
see
her
of
course
she
may
be
able
to
explain
he
looked
across
the
table
beneath
his
shaggy
gray
eyebrows
paul
did
not
at
that
moment
look
a
likely
subject
for
explanations
even
the
explanations
of
a
beautiful
woman
but
there
was
one
human
quantity
which
in
all
his
experience
karl
steinmetz
had
never
successfully
gauged
namely
the
extent
of
a
woman
power
over
the
man
who
loves
or
at
one
time
has
loved
her
she
can
not
explain
away
stépan
lanovitch
ruined
life
she
can
hardly
explain
away
a
thousand
deaths
from
unnatural
causes
every
winter
in
this
province
alone
this
was
what
steinmetz
dreaded
justice
give
her
the
opportunity
he
said
paul
was
looking
out
of
the
window
his
singularly
firm
mouth
was
still
and
quiet
not
a
mouth
for
explanations
i
will
if
you
like
he
said
i
do
like
paul
i
beg
of
you
to
do
it
and
remember
that
she
is
not
a
man
this
like
other
appeals
of
the
same
nature
fell
on
stony
ground
paul
simply
did
not
understand
it
in
all
the
years
of
his
work
among
the
peasants
it
is
possible
that
some
of
conventional
charity
had
been
dried
up
scorched
in
the
glare
of
burning
injustice
he
was
not
at
this
moment
in
a
mood
to
consider
the
only
excuse
that
steinmetz
seemed
to
be
able
to
urge
the
sun
had
set
long
ago
the
short
twilight
lay
over
the
land
with
a
chill
hopelessness
steinmetz
looked
at
his
watch
they
had
been
together
an
hour
one
of
those
hours
that
count
as
years
in
a
life
time
he
had
to
peer
into
the
face
of
the
watch
in
order
to
see
the
hands
the
room
was
almost
dark
and
no
servant
ever
came
to
it
unless
summoned
paul
was
looking
down
at
his
companion
as
if
waiting
to
hear
the
time
at
great
moments
we
are
suddenly
brought
face
to
face
with
the
limits
of
human
nature
it
is
at
such
moments
that
we
find
that
we
are
not
gods
but
only
men
we
can
only
feel
to
a
certain
extent
only
suffer
up
to
a
certain
point
we
must
dress
for
dinner
said
steinmetz
afterward
well
afterward
we
shall
see
yes
answered
paul
and
he
did
not
go
the
two
men
stood
looking
at
each
other
for
a
moment
they
had
passed
through
much
together
danger
excitement
and
now
they
were
dabbling
in
sorrow
it
would
appear
that
this
same
sorrow
runs
like
a
river
across
the
road
of
our
life
some
of
us
find
the
ford
and
plash
through
the
shallows
shallow
ourselves
while
others
flounder
into
deep
water
these
are
they
who
look
right
on
to
the
greater
events
and
fail
to
note
the
trivial
details
of
each
little
step
paul
was
wading
through
the
deep
water
and
this
good
friend
of
his
was
not
inclined
to
stand
upon
the
bank
it
is
while
passing
through
this
river
that
fortune
sends
some
of
us
a
friend
who
is
ever
afterward
different
from
all
others
paul
stood
looking
down
at
the
broad
heavy
face
of
the
man
who
loved
him
like
a
father
it
was
not
easy
for
him
to
speak
he
seemed
to
be
making
an
effort
i
do
not
want
you
to
think
he
said
at
last
that
it
is
as
bad
as
it
might
have
been
it
might
have
been
worse
much
worse
had
i
not
made
a
mistake
in
regard
to
my
own
feelings
when
i
married
her
i
will
try
and
do
the
right
thing
by
her
only
at
present
there
does
not
seem
to
be
much
left
except
you
steinmetz
looked
up
with
his
quaintly
resigned
smile
ah
yes
he
said
i
am
there
always
chapter
xxxix
husband
and
wife
karl
steinmetz
had
shown
the
depth
of
his
knowledge
of
men
and
women
when
he
commented
on
that
power
of
facing
danger
with
an
unruffled
countenance
which
he
was
pleased
to
attribute
to
english
ladies
above
all
women
during
the
evening
he
had
full
opportunity
of
verifying
his
own
observations
etta
came
down
to
dinner
smiling
and
imperturbable
on
the
threshold
of
the
she
exchanged
a
glance
with
karl
steinmetz
and
that
was
all
at
dinner
it
was
maggie
and
paul
who
were
silent
etta
talked
to
steinmetz
brightly
gayly
with
a
certain
courage
of
a
very
high
order
for
she
was
desperate
and
she
did
not
show
it
at
last
the
evening
came
to
an
end
maggie
had
sung
two
songs
steinmetz
had
performed
on
the
piano
with
a
marvellous
touch
all
had
played
their
parts
with
the
brazen
faces
which
steinmetz
in
his
knowledge
of
many
nations
assigned
to
the
race
before
others
at
last
etta
rose
to
go
to
bed
with
a
little
sharp
sigh
of
great
suspense
it
was
coming
she
went
up
to
her
room
bidding
maggie
in
the
passage
in
a
mechanical
way
she
allowed
the
maid
to
array
her
in
a
dressing
gown
soft
silken
a
dainty
triumph
in
its
way
then
almost
impatiently
she
sent
the
maid
away
when
her
hair
was
only
half
released
she
would
brush
it
herself
she
was
tired
no
she
wanted
nothing
more
she
sat
down
by
the
fire
brush
in
hand
she
could
hardly
breathe
it
was
coming
she
heard
paul
come
to
his
she
heard
his
deep
quiet
voice
reply
to
some
question
of
his
valet
then
the
word
in
the
same
quiet
voice
the
valet
had
gone
there
was
only
the
door
now
between
her
and
what
her
fingers
were
at
the
throat
of
her
the
soft
lace
seemed
to
choke
her
then
paul
knocked
at
the
door
it
was
coming
she
opened
her
lips
but
at
first
could
make
no
sound
come
in
she
said
at
length
hoarsely
she
wondered
whether
he
would
kill
her
she
wondered
whether
she
was
in
love
with
her
husband
she
had
begun
wondering
that
lately
she
was
wondering
it
when
he
came
in
he
had
changed
his
for
a
jacket
in
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
working
with
steinmetz
in
the
quiet
room
after
the
household
had
gone
to
bed
she
looked
up
she
dropped
the
brush
and
ran
toward
him
with
a
great
rustle
of
her
flowing
silks
oh
paul
what
is
it
she
cried
she
stopped
short
not
daring
to
touch
him
before
his
cold
set
face
have
you
seen
any
one
she
whispered
only
de
chauxville
he
answered
this
afternoon
indeed
paul
she
protested
hastily
it
was
nothing
a
message
from
catrina
lanovitch
it
was
only
the
usual
visit
of
an
acquaintance
it
would
have
been
very
strange
if
he
had
not
called
do
you
think
i
could
care
for
a
man
like
that
i
never
did
think
so
until
now
returned
paul
steadily
your
excuses
accuse
you
you
may
care
for
him
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
care
she
turned
slowly
and
went
back
to
her
chair
mechanically
she
took
up
the
brush
and
shook
back
her
beautiful
hair
you
mean
you
do
not
care
for
me
she
said
oh
paul
be
careful
paul
stood
looking
at
her
he
was
not
a
man
at
all
he
was
not
one
of
those
who
take
it
upon
themselves
to
say
that
they
understand
women
using
the
word
in
an
offensively
general
sense
as
if
women
were
situated
midway
between
the
human
and
the
animal
races
he
was
enough
to
look
upon
women
as
higher
and
purer
than
men
while
equally
capable
of
thought
and
he
had
it
must
be
remembered
no
great
taste
for
fictional
literature
he
had
not
read
the
voluminous
lucubrations
of
the
modern
woman
writer
he
had
not
assisted
at
the
nauseating
spectacle
of
a
woman
morally
turning
herself
inside
out
in
three
volumes
and
an
interview
no
this
man
respected
women
still
and
he
paid
them
an
honor
which
thank
heaven
most
of
them
still
deserve
he
treated
them
as
men
in
the
sense
that
he
considered
them
to
be
under
the
same
code
of
right
and
wrong
of
good
and
evil
he
did
not
understand
what
etta
meant
when
she
told
him
to
be
careful
he
did
not
know
that
the
modern
social
code
is
like
the
spanish
grammar
there
are
so
many
exceptions
that
the
rules
are
hardly
worth
noting
and
one
of
our
most
notorious
modern
exceptions
is
the
married
woman
who
is
pleased
to
hold
herself
excused
because
outsiders
tell
her
that
her
husband
does
not
understand
her
i
do
not
think
said
paul
judicially
that
you
can
have
cared
very
much
whether
i
loved
you
or
not
when
you
married
me
you
knew
that
i
was
the
promoter
of
the
charity
league
i
almost
told
you
i
told
you
so
much
that
with
your
knowledge
you
must
have
been
aware
of
the
fact
that
i
was
heavily
interested
in
the
undertaking
which
you
betrayed
you
married
me
without
certain
proof
of
your
husband
death
such
was
your
indecent
haste
to
call
yourself
a
princess
and
now
i
find
on
your
own
confession
that
you
have
a
clandestine
understanding
with
a
man
who
tried
to
murder
me
only
a
week
ago
is
it
not
rather
absurd
to
talk
of
caring
he
stood
looking
down
at
her
cold
and
terrible
in
the
white
heat
of
his
suppressed
northern
anger
the
little
clock
on
the
in
a
terrible
hurry
ticked
with
all
its
might
time
was
speeding
every
moment
was
against
her
and
she
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
simply
because
those
things
that
she
would
have
said
to
others
would
carry
no
weight
with
this
man
etta
was
leaning
forward
in
the
luxurious
chair
staring
with
haggard
eyes
into
the
fire
the
flames
leaped
up
and
gleamed
on
her
pale
face
in
her
deep
eyes
i
suppose
she
said
without
looking
at
him
that
you
will
not
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
i
hate
the
man
i
knew
nothing
of
what
you
refer
to
as
happening
last
week
his
attempt
to
murder
you
i
mean
you
are
a
prince
and
in
your
own
province
can
you
not
throw
him
into
prison
and
keep
him
there
such
things
are
done
in
russia
he
is
more
dangerous
than
you
think
please
do
it
please
paul
looked
at
her
with
hard
unresponsive
eyes
lives
depended
on
his
answer
i
did
not
come
here
to
discuss
claude
de
chauxville
he
said
but
you
and
our
future
etta
drew
herself
up
as
one
under
the
lash
and
waited
with
set
teeth
i
propose
he
said
in
a
final
voice
which
made
it
no
proposition
at
all
that
you
go
home
to
england
at
once
with
your
cousin
this
country
is
not
safe
for
you
the
house
in
london
will
be
at
your
disposal
i
will
make
a
suitable
settlement
on
you
sufficient
to
live
in
accordance
with
your
title
and
position
i
must
ask
you
to
remember
that
the
name
you
bear
has
hitherto
been
an
unsullied
one
we
have
been
proud
of
our
princesses
up
to
now
in
case
of
any
trouble
reaching
you
from
outside
sources
connected
with
this
country
i
should
like
you
to
remember
that
you
are
under
my
protection
and
that
of
steinmetz
either
of
us
will
be
glad
at
any
time
to
consider
any
appeal
for
assistance
that
you
may
think
fit
to
make
you
will
always
be
the
princess
howard
alexis
etta
gave
a
sudden
laugh
oh
yes
she
said
and
her
face
was
strangely
red
i
shall
still
be
the
princess
alexis
with
sufficient
money
to
keep
up
the
position
he
went
on
with
the
cruel
irony
of
a
man
a
queer
twisted
smile
passed
across
etta
face
the
smile
of
one
who
is
in
agony
and
will
not
shriek
there
are
certain
stipulations
which
i
must
make
in
went
on
paul
i
must
ask
you
to
cease
all
communication
of
whatever
nature
with
the
baron
de
chauxville
i
am
not
jealous
of
him
now
i
do
not
know
why
he
paused
as
if
wondering
what
the
meaning
of
this
might
be
etta
knew
it
the
knowledge
was
part
of
her
punishment
but
continued
her
husband
i
am
not
going
to
sacrifice
the
name
my
mother
bore
to
the
vanity
of
a
french
coxcomb
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
avoid
all
society
where
it
is
likely
that
you
should
meet
him
if
you
disregard
my
desires
in
this
matter
i
shall
be
compelled
to
take
means
to
enforce
them
what
means
i
shall
reduce
your
allowance
their
eyes
met
and
perhaps
that
was
the
bitterest
moment
in
life
dead
things
are
better
put
out
of
sight
at
once
etta
felt
that
paul
dead
love
would
grin
at
her
in
every
sovereign
of
the
allowance
which
was
to
be
hers
she
would
never
get
away
from
it
she
could
never
shake
off
its
memory
am
i
to
live
alone
asked
etta
suddenly
finding
her
voice
that
is
as
you
like
answered
paul
perhaps
purposely
misunderstanding
her
you
are
at
liberty
to
have
any
friend
or
companion
you
wish
perhaps
your
cousin
maggie
yes
answered
paul
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
entered
the
room
his
eyes
were
averted
from
etta
face
she
would
not
live
with
me
said
the
princess
curtly
paul
seemed
to
be
reflecting
when
he
next
spoke
it
was
in
a
kinder
voice
you
need
not
tell
the
circumstances
which
have
given
rise
to
this
arrangement
etta
shrugged
her
shoulders
that
went
on
paul
rests
entirely
with
yourself
you
may
be
sure
that
i
will
tell
no
one
i
am
not
likely
to
discuss
it
with
any
one
whomsoever
etta
stony
eyes
softened
for
a
moment
she
seemed
to
be
alternating
between
hatred
of
this
man
and
love
of
him
a
dangerous
state
for
any
woman
it
is
possible
that
if
he
had
held
his
hand
out
to
her
she
would
have
been
at
his
feet
in
a
wild
incoherent
passion
of
and
abasement
such
moments
as
these
turn
our
lives
and
determine
them
paul
knew
nothing
of
the
issue
hanging
on
this
moment
on
the
passing
softness
of
her
eyes
he
knew
nothing
of
the
danger
in
which
this
woman
stood
of
the
temptation
with
which
she
was
wrestling
he
went
on
in
his
blindness
went
on
being
only
just
if
he
said
you
have
any
further
questions
to
ask
i
shall
always
be
at
your
service
for
the
next
few
days
i
shall
be
busy
the
peasants
are
in
a
state
of
discontent
verging
on
rebellion
we
can
not
at
present
arrange
for
your
journey
to
tver
but
as
soon
as
it
is
possible
i
will
tell
you
he
looked
at
the
clock
and
made
an
imperceptible
movement
toward
the
door
etta
glanced
up
sharply
she
did
not
seem
to
be
breathing
is
that
all
she
asked
in
a
dull
voice
there
was
a
long
silence
tense
and
throbbing
the
great
silence
of
the
steppe
i
think
so
answered
paul
at
length
i
have
tried
to
be
just
then
justice
is
very
cruel
not
so
cruel
as
the
woman
who
for
a
few
pounds
sells
the
happiness
of
thousands
of
human
beings
steinmetz
advised
me
to
speak
to
you
he
suggested
the
possibility
of
circumstances
of
which
we
are
ignorant
he
said
that
you
might
be
able
to
explain
silence
can
you
explain
silence
etta
sat
looking
into
the
fire
the
little
clock
hurried
on
at
length
etta
drew
a
deep
breath
you
are
the
sort
of
man
she
said
who
does
not
understand
temptation
you
are
strong
the
devil
leaves
the
strong
in
peace
you
have
found
virtue
easy
because
you
have
never
wanted
money
your
position
has
always
been
assured
your
name
alone
is
a
password
through
the
world
your
sort
are
always
hard
on
women
who
who
what
have
i
done
after
all
some
instinct
bade
her
rise
to
her
feet
and
stand
before
him
tall
beautiful
passionate
a
woman
in
a
thousand
a
fit
mate
for
such
as
he
her
beautiful
hair
in
burnished
glory
round
her
face
gleamed
in
the
firelight
her
white
fingers
clenched
her
arms
thrown
back
her
breast
panting
beneath
the
lace
her
proud
face
looking
defiance
into
his
no
one
but
a
prince
could
have
braved
this
princess
what
have
i
done
she
cried
a
second
time
i
have
only
fought
for
myself
and
if
i
have
won
so
much
the
greater
credit
i
am
your
wife
i
have
done
nothing
the
law
can
touch
thousands
of
women
moving
in
our
circle
are
not
half
so
good
as
i
am
i
swear
before
god
i
am
hush
he
said
with
upraised
hand
i
never
doubted
that
i
will
do
any
thing
you
wish
she
went
on
and
in
her
humility
she
was
very
dangerous
i
deceived
you
i
know
but
i
sold
the
charity
league
before
i
knew
that
you
that
you
thought
of
me
when
i
married
you
i
did
love
you
i
admit
that
but
paul
oh
paul
if
you
were
not
so
good
you
would
understand
perhaps
he
did
understand
for
there
was
that
in
her
eyes
that
made
her
meaning
clear
he
was
silent
standing
before
her
in
his
great
strength
his
marvellous
and
cruel
you
will
not
forgive
me
for
a
moment
she
leaned
forward
peering
into
his
face
he
seemed
to
be
reflecting
yes
he
said
at
length
i
forgive
you
but
if
i
cared
for
you
forgiveness
would
be
impossible
he
went
slowly
toward
the
door
etta
looked
round
the
room
with
drawn
eyes
their
room
the
room
he
had
fitted
up
for
his
bride
with
the
lavishness
of
a
great
wealth
and
a
great
love
he
paused
with
his
hand
on
the
door
and
she
said
with
fiery
cheeks
does
your
forgiveness
date
from
yes
he
opened
the
door
he
said
and
went
out
chapter
xl
stépan
returns
at
daybreak
the
next
morning
karl
steinmetz
was
awakened
by
the
familiar
cry
of
the
wolf
beneath
his
window
he
rose
and
dressed
hastily
the
eastern
sky
was
faintly
pink
a
rosy
twilight
moved
among
the
pines
he
went
down
stairs
and
opened
the
little
door
at
the
back
of
the
castle
it
was
of
course
the
starosta
shivering
and
bleached
in
the
chilly
dawn
they
have
watched
my
cottage
excellency
all
night
it
was
only
now
that
i
could
get
away
there
are
two
strange
sleighs
outside
hut
there
are
marks
of
many
sleighs
that
have
been
and
gone
excellency
it
is
unsafe
for
any
one
to
venture
outside
the
castle
you
must
send
to
tver
for
the
soldiers
the
prince
refuses
to
do
that
but
why
excellency
we
shall
be
killed
you
do
not
know
the
effect
of
platoon
firing
on
a
closely
packed
mob
starost
the
prince
does
replied
steinmetz
with
his
grim
smile
they
spoke
together
in
hushed
voices
for
half
an
hour
while
the
daylight
crept
up
the
eastern
sky
then
the
starosta
stole
away
among
the
still
larches
like
the
wolf
whose
cry
he
imitated
so
perfectly
steinmetz
closed
the
door
and
went
upstairs
to
his
own
room
his
face
grave
and
thoughtful
his
tread
heavy
with
the
weight
of
anxiety
the
day
passed
as
such
days
do
etta
was
not
the
woman
to
plead
a
conventional
headache
and
remain
hidden
she
came
down
to
breakfast
and
during
that
meal
was
boldly
conversational
she
has
spirit
reflected
karl
steinmetz
behind
his
quiet
gray
eyes
he
admired
her
for
it
and
helped
her
he
threw
back
the
ball
of
conversation
with
imperturbable
good
humor
they
were
completely
shut
in
no
news
from
the
outer
world
penetrated
to
the
little
party
besieged
within
their
own
stone
walls
maggie
fearless
and
innocent
announced
her
intention
of
but
was
dissuaded
therefrom
by
steinmetz
with
covert
warnings
during
the
morning
each
was
occupied
in
individual
affairs
at
luncheon
time
they
met
again
etta
was
now
almost
defiant
she
was
on
her
mettle
she
was
so
near
to
loving
paul
that
a
hatred
of
him
welled
up
within
her
breast
whenever
he
repelled
her
advances
with
uncompromising
reticence
they
did
not
know
perhaps
she
hardly
knew
herself
that
the
opening
of
the
depended
upon
her
humor
in
the
afternoon
etta
and
maggie
sat
as
was
their
wont
in
the
looking
out
over
the
cliff
of
late
their
intercourse
had
been
slightly
strained
they
had
never
had
much
in
common
although
circumstances
had
thrown
their
lives
together
it
is
one
of
the
ills
to
which
women
are
heir
that
they
have
frequently
to
pass
their
whole
lives
in
the
society
of
persons
with
whom
they
have
no
real
sympathy
both
these
women
were
conscious
of
the
little
rift
within
the
lute
but
such
rifts
are
better
treated
with
silence
that
which
comes
to
interfere
with
a
woman
friendship
will
not
often
bear
discussion
at
dusk
steinmetz
went
out
he
had
an
appointment
with
the
starosta
paul
was
sitting
in
his
own
room
making
a
pretence
of
work
about
five
when
steinmetz
came
hurriedly
to
him
a
new
development
he
said
shortly
come
to
my
room
paul
rose
and
followed
him
through
the
double
doorway
built
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
steinmetz
large
room
was
lighted
only
by
a
lamp
standing
on
the
table
all
the
light
was
thrown
on
the
desk
by
a
large
green
shade
leaving
the
rest
of
the
room
in
a
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
a
man
was
standing
in
an
expectant
attitude
there
was
something
furtive
about
this
intruder
and
at
the
same
time
familiar
to
paul
who
peered
at
him
through
the
gloom
then
the
man
came
hurriedly
forward
ah
pavlo
pavlo
he
said
in
a
deep
hollow
voice
i
could
not
expect
you
to
know
me
he
threw
his
arms
around
him
and
embraced
him
after
the
simple
manner
of
russia
then
he
held
him
at
arm
length
stépan
said
paul
no
i
did
not
know
you
stépan
lanovitch
was
still
holding
him
at
arm
length
examining
him
with
the
large
faint
blue
eyes
which
so
often
go
with
an
exaggerated
philanthropy
old
he
muttered
old
ah
my
poor
pavlo
i
heard
in
kiew
you
know
how
we
outlaws
hear
such
things
that
you
were
in
trouble
so
i
came
to
you
steinmetz
in
the
background
raised
his
patient
eyebrows
there
are
two
men
in
the
world
went
on
the
voluble
lanovitch
who
can
manage
the
moujiks
of
tver
you
and
i
so
i
came
i
will
help
you
pavlo
i
will
stand
by
you
together
we
can
assuredly
quell
this
revolt
paul
nodded
and
allowed
himself
to
be
embraced
a
second
time
he
had
long
known
stépan
lanovitch
of
thors
as
one
of
the
many
who
go
about
the
world
doing
good
with
their
eyes
shut
for
the
moment
he
had
absolutely
no
use
for
this
blunderer
i
am
afraid
he
said
that
it
has
got
beyond
control
we
can
not
stamp
it
out
now
except
by
force
and
i
would
rather
not
do
that
our
only
hope
is
that
it
may
burn
itself
out
the
talkers
must
get
hoarse
in
time
lanovitch
shook
his
head
they
have
been
talking
since
the
days
of
ananias
he
said
and
they
are
not
hoarse
yet
i
fear
pavlo
there
will
never
be
peace
in
the
world
until
the
talkers
are
hoarse
how
did
you
get
here
asked
paul
who
was
always
businesslike
i
brought
a
pack
on
my
back
and
sold
cotton
i
made
myself
known
to
the
starosta
and
he
communicated
with
good
karl
here
did
you
learn
any
thing
in
the
village
asked
paul
no
they
suspected
me
they
would
not
talk
but
i
understand
them
pavlo
these
poor
simple
fools
a
pebble
in
the
stream
would
turn
the
current
of
their
convictions
tell
them
who
is
the
moscow
doctor
it
is
your
only
chance
steinmetz
grunted
acquiescence
and
walked
wearily
to
the
window
this
was
only
an
old
and
futile
argument
of
his
own
and
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
live
another
day
among
them
said
paul
do
you
think
petersburg
would
countenance
a
prince
who
works
among
his
moujiks
stépan
lanovitch
pale
blue
eyes
looked
troubled
steinmetz
shrugged
his
shoulders
they
have
brought
it
on
themselves
he
said
as
much
as
a
lamb
brings
the
knife
upon
itself
by
growing
up
replied
paul
lanovitch
shook
his
white
head
with
a
tolerant
little
smile
he
loved
these
poor
helpless
peasants
with
a
love
as
large
as
and
a
thousand
times
less
practical
than
paul
in
the
meantime
paul
was
thinking
in
his
clear
direct
way
it
was
this
man
habit
in
life
and
in
thought
to
walk
straight
past
the
side
issues
it
is
like
you
stépan
he
said
at
length
to
come
to
us
at
this
time
we
feel
it
and
we
recognize
the
generosity
of
it
for
steinmetz
and
i
know
the
danger
you
are
running
in
coming
back
to
this
country
but
we
can
not
let
you
do
it
no
do
not
protest
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
we
might
quell
the
revolt
no
doubt
we
should
the
two
of
us
together
but
what
would
happen
afterward
you
would
be
sent
back
to
siberia
and
i
should
probably
follow
you
for
harboring
an
escaped
convict
the
face
of
the
impulsive
philanthropist
dropped
pathetically
he
had
come
to
his
friend
assistance
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
he
was
destined
as
some
men
are
to
plunge
about
the
world
seeking
to
do
good
and
it
has
been
decreed
that
good
must
be
done
by
stealth
and
after
deliberation
only
he
who
does
good
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
usually
sows
a
seed
of
dissension
in
the
trench
of
time
also
went
on
paul
with
that
deliberate
grasp
of
the
situation
which
never
failed
to
astonish
the
steinmetz
also
you
have
other
calls
upon
your
energy
you
have
other
work
to
do
lanovitch
broad
face
lightened
up
his
benevolent
brow
beamed
his
capacity
for
work
had
brought
him
to
the
shoemaker
last
in
tomsk
it
is
a
vice
that
grows
with
indulgence
it
has
pleased
the
authorities
went
on
paul
who
was
shy
of
religious
turns
of
phrase
to
give
us
all
our
own
troubles
mine
such
as
they
are
stépan
must
be
managed
by
myself
yours
can
be
faced
by
no
one
but
you
you
have
come
at
the
right
moment
you
do
not
quite
realize
what
your
coming
means
to
catrina
catrina
ah
the
weak
blue
eyes
looked
into
the
strong
face
and
read
nothing
there
i
doubt
said
paul
whether
it
is
right
for
you
to
continue
sacrificing
catrina
for
the
sake
of
the
little
good
that
you
are
able
to
do
you
are
hampered
in
your
good
work
to
such
an
extent
that
the
result
is
very
small
while
the
pain
you
give
is
very
great
but
is
that
so
pavlo
is
my
child
unhappy
i
fear
so
replied
paul
gravely
with
his
baffling
she
has
not
much
in
common
with
her
mother
you
understand
ah
yes
it
is
you
to
whom
she
is
attached
sometimes
it
is
so
with
children
and
parents
one
can
not
tell
why
steinmetz
looked
as
if
he
could
supply
information
upon
the
subject
but
he
remained
silent
standing
as
it
were
in
an
acquiescent
attitude
you
have
fought
your
fight
said
paul
a
good
fight
too
you
have
struck
your
blow
for
the
country
you
have
sown
your
seed
but
the
harvest
is
not
yet
now
it
is
time
to
think
of
your
own
safety
of
the
happiness
of
your
own
child
stépan
lanovitch
turned
away
and
sat
heavily
down
he
leaned
his
two
arms
on
the
table
and
his
chin
upon
his
clenched
hands
why
not
leave
the
country
now
at
all
events
for
a
few
years
went
on
paul
and
when
a
man
who
is
accustomed
to
command
stoops
to
persuade
it
is
strong
persuasion
that
he
wields
you
can
take
catrina
with
you
you
will
be
assuring
her
happiness
which
at
all
events
is
something
tangible
a
present
harvest
i
will
drive
over
to
thors
now
and
bring
her
back
you
can
leave
and
go
to
america
stépan
lanovitch
raised
his
head
and
looked
hard
into
paul
face
you
wish
it
i
think
answered
paul
steadily
that
it
is
for
catrina
happiness
then
lanovitch
rose
up
and
took
paul
hand
in
his
grip
go
my
son
it
will
be
a
great
happiness
to
me
i
will
wait
here
he
said
paul
went
straight
to
the
door
he
was
a
man
with
a
capacity
for
prompt
action
which
seemed
to
rise
to
demand
steinmetz
followed
him
out
into
the
passage
and
took
him
by
the
arm
you
can
not
do
it
he
said
yes
i
can
replied
paul
i
can
find
my
way
through
the
forest
no
one
will
venture
to
follow
me
there
in
the
dark
steinmetz
hesitated
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
went
back
into
the
room
the
ladies
at
thors
were
dressed
for
dinner
were
indeed
awaiting
the
announcement
of
that
meal
when
paul
broke
in
upon
their
solitude
he
did
not
pause
to
lay
aside
his
furs
but
went
into
the
long
low
room
withdrawing
his
seal
gloves
painfully
for
it
was
freezing
as
it
only
can
freeze
in
march
the
countess
assailed
him
with
many
questions
more
or
less
sensible
which
he
endured
patiently
until
the
servant
had
left
the
room
catrina
with
flushed
cheeks
stood
looking
at
him
but
said
nothing
paul
withdrew
his
gloves
and
submitted
to
the
countess
futile
tugs
at
his
fur
coat
then
catrina
spoke
the
baron
de
chauxville
has
left
us
she
said
without
knowing
exactly
why
for
the
moment
paul
had
forgotten
claude
de
chauxville
existence
i
have
news
for
you
he
said
and
he
gently
pushed
the
chattering
countess
aside
stépan
lanovitch
is
at
osterno
he
arrived
ah
they
have
set
him
free
poor
man
does
he
wear
chains
on
his
ankles
is
his
hair
long
my
poor
stépan
ah
but
what
a
stupid
man
the
countess
collapsed
into
a
soft
chair
she
chose
a
soft
one
obviously
it
has
to
be
recorded
here
that
she
did
not
receive
the
news
with
unmitigated
joy
when
he
was
in
siberia
she
gasped
one
knew
at
all
events
where
he
was
and
now
mon
dieu
what
an
anxiety
i
have
come
over
to
see
whether
you
will
join
him
and
go
with
him
to
america
said
paul
looking
at
her
to
america
my
dear
paul
are
you
mad
one
can
not
do
such
things
as
that
america
that
is
across
the
sea
yes
answered
paul
and
i
am
such
a
bad
sailor
now
if
it
had
been
paris
but
it
can
not
be
interrupted
paul
will
you
join
your
father
he
added
turning
to
catrina
the
girl
was
looking
at
him
with
something
in
her
eyes
that
he
did
not
care
to
meet
and
go
to
america
she
asked
in
a
lifeless
voice
paul
nodded
catrina
turned
suddenly
away
from
him
and
walked
to
the
fire
where
she
stood
with
her
back
toward
him
a
small
uncouth
figure
in
black
and
green
the
lamplight
gleaming
on
her
wonderful
hair
she
turned
suddenly
again
and
coming
back
stood
looking
into
his
face
i
will
go
she
said
you
think
it
best
yes
he
answered
i
think
it
best
she
drew
a
sharp
breath
and
was
about
to
speak
when
the
countess
interrupted
her
what
she
cried
you
are
going
away
like
this
without
any
luggage
and
pray
what
is
to
become
of
me
you
can
join
them
in
america
said
paul
in
his
quietest
tone
or
you
can
live
in
paris
at
last
chapter
xli
duty
it
was
not
now
a
very
cold
night
there
were
fleecy
clouds
thrown
like
puffs
of
smoke
against
the
western
sky
the
moon
on
the
wane
a
small
crescent
lying
on
its
back
was
lowering
toward
the
horizon
the
thermometer
had
risen
since
sunset
as
it
often
does
in
march
there
was
a
suggestion
of
spring
in
the
air
it
seemed
that
at
last
the
long
winter
was
drawing
to
a
close
that
the
iron
grip
of
frost
was
relaxing
paul
went
out
and
inspected
the
harness
by
the
light
of
a
stable
lantern
held
in
the
mittened
hand
of
a
yemschick
he
had
reasons
of
his
own
for
absenting
himself
while
catrina
bade
her
mother
farewell
he
was
rather
afraid
of
these
women
the
harness
inspected
he
began
reckoning
how
many
hours
of
moonlight
might
still
be
vouchsafed
to
him
the
stableman
seeing
the
direction
of
his
gaze
began
to
talk
of
the
weather
and
the
possibilities
of
snow
in
the
near
future
they
conversed
in
low
voices
together
presently
the
door
opened
and
catrina
came
quickly
out
followed
by
a
servant
carrying
a
small
paul
could
not
see
catrina
face
she
was
veiled
and
furred
to
the
eyelids
without
a
word
the
girl
took
her
seat
in
the
sleigh
and
the
servant
prepared
the
rugs
paul
gathered
up
the
reins
and
took
his
place
beside
her
a
few
moments
were
required
to
draw
up
the
rugs
and
fasten
them
with
straps
then
paul
gave
the
word
and
the
horses
leaped
forward
as
they
sped
down
the
avenue
catrina
turned
and
looked
her
last
on
thors
before
long
paul
wheeled
into
the
trackless
forest
he
had
come
very
carefully
steering
chiefly
by
the
moon
and
stars
with
occasional
assistance
from
a
bend
of
the
winding
river
at
times
he
had
taken
to
the
ice
following
the
course
of
the
stream
for
a
few
miles
no
snow
had
fallen
it
would
be
easy
to
return
on
his
own
track
through
this
part
of
the
forest
no
road
was
cut
for
nearly
half
an
hour
they
drove
in
silence
only
the
whistle
of
the
runners
on
the
powdery
snow
the
creak
of
the
warming
leather
on
the
horses
the
regular
breathing
of
the
team
broke
the
stillness
of
the
forest
paul
hoped
against
hope
that
catrina
was
asleep
she
sat
by
his
side
her
arm
touching
his
sleeve
her
weight
thrown
against
him
at
such
times
as
the
sleigh
bumped
over
a
fallen
tree
or
some
inequality
of
the
ground
he
could
not
help
wondering
what
thoughts
there
were
behind
her
silence
steinmetz
banter
had
come
back
to
his
memory
during
the
last
few
days
in
a
new
light
paul
said
the
woman
at
his
side
quite
suddenly
breaking
the
silence
of
the
great
forest
where
they
had
grown
to
life
and
sorrow
almost
side
by
side
yes
i
want
to
know
how
this
all
came
about
it
is
not
my
father
doing
there
is
something
quick
and
practical
and
wise
which
suggests
you
and
herr
steinmetz
i
suspect
that
you
have
done
this
you
and
he
for
our
happiness
no
answered
paul
it
was
mere
accident
your
father
heard
of
our
trouble
in
kiew
you
know
him
always
impulsive
and
reckless
he
never
thinks
of
the
danger
he
came
to
help
us
catrina
smiled
wanly
but
it
for
our
happiness
is
it
not
paul
you
know
that
it
is
that
is
why
you
have
done
it
i
have
not
had
time
yet
to
realize
what
i
am
doing
all
that
is
going
to
happen
but
if
it
is
your
doing
i
think
i
shall
be
content
to
abide
by
the
result
it
is
not
my
doing
replied
paul
who
did
not
like
her
wistful
tone
it
is
the
outcome
of
circumstances
circumstances
have
been
ruling
us
all
lately
we
seem
to
have
no
time
to
consider
but
only
to
do
that
which
seems
best
for
the
moment
and
it
is
best
that
i
should
go
to
america
with
my
father
her
voice
was
composed
and
quiet
in
the
dim
light
he
could
not
see
her
white
lips
indeed
he
never
looked
it
seems
so
to
me
undoubtedly
he
said
in
doing
this
so
far
as
we
can
see
at
present
it
seems
certain
that
you
are
saving
your
father
from
siberia
you
know
what
he
is
he
never
thinks
of
his
own
safety
he
ought
never
to
have
come
here
if
he
remains
in
russia
it
is
an
absolute
certainty
that
he
will
sooner
or
later
be
rearrested
he
is
one
of
those
good
people
who
require
saving
from
themselves
catrina
nodded
at
times
duty
is
the
of
happiness
the
girl
was
dimly
aware
that
she
was
holding
to
this
she
was
simple
and
unsophisticated
enough
to
consider
paul
opinion
infallible
at
the
great
of
life
we
are
apt
to
ask
the
way
of
any
body
who
happens
to
be
near
catrina
might
perhaps
have
made
a
worse
choice
of
counsel
for
paul
was
honest
as
you
put
it
she
said
it
is
clearly
my
duty
there
is
a
sort
of
consolation
in
that
however
painful
it
may
be
at
the
time
i
suppose
it
is
consolatory
to
look
back
and
think
that
at
all
events
one
did
duty
i
do
know
answered
paul
simply
i
suppose
so
looking
back
was
not
included
in
his
method
of
life
which
was
rather
characterized
by
a
large
faith
and
a
forward
pressure
whenever
there
was
question
of
considering
life
as
an
abstract
he
drew
within
his
shell
with
a
manlike
shyness
he
had
no
generalities
ready
for
each
emergency
would
father
have
gone
alone
she
asked
with
a
very
human
thrill
of
hope
in
her
voice
no
answered
paul
steadily
i
think
not
but
you
can
ask
him
they
had
never
been
so
distant
as
they
were
at
this
moment
so
cold
such
mere
acquaintances
and
they
had
played
together
in
one
nursery
of
course
if
that
is
the
case
said
the
girl
my
duty
is
quite
clear
it
required
some
persuasion
to
make
him
consent
to
go
even
with
you
said
paul
a
rough
piece
of
going
for
there
was
no
road
debarred
further
conversation
at
this
time
the
sleigh
rolled
and
bumped
over
one
fallen
tree
after
another
paul
with
his
feet
stretched
out
wedged
firmly
into
the
sleigh
encouraged
the
tired
horses
with
rein
and
voice
catrina
was
compelled
to
steady
herself
with
both
hands
on
the
bar
of
the
apron
for
the
apron
of
a
russian
sleigh
is
a
heavy
piece
of
leather
stretched
on
a
wooden
bar
then
you
think
my
duty
is
quite
clear
repeated
the
girl
at
length
paul
did
not
answer
at
once
i
am
sure
of
it
he
said
and
there
the
question
ended
catrina
lanovitch
who
had
never
been
ruled
by
those
about
her
shaped
her
whole
life
unquestioningly
upon
an
opinion
they
did
not
speak
for
some
time
and
then
it
was
the
girl
who
broke
the
silence
i
have
a
confession
to
make
and
a
favor
to
ask
she
said
bluntly
paul
attitude
denoted
attention
but
he
said
nothing
it
is
about
the
baron
de
chauxville
she
said
ah
i
am
a
coward
she
went
on
i
did
not
know
it
before
it
is
rather
humiliating
i
have
been
trying
for
some
weeks
to
tell
you
something
but
i
am
horribly
afraid
of
it
i
am
afraid
you
will
despise
me
i
have
been
a
fool
worse
perhaps
i
never
knew
that
claude
de
chauxville
was
the
sort
of
person
he
is
i
allowed
him
to
find
out
things
about
me
which
he
never
should
have
known
my
own
private
affairs
i
mean
then
i
became
frightened
and
he
tried
to
make
use
of
me
i
think
he
makes
use
of
know
what
he
is
yes
answered
paul
i
know
he
hates
you
she
went
on
i
do
not
want
to
make
mischief
but
i
suppose
he
wanted
to
marry
the
princess
his
vanity
was
wounded
because
she
preferred
you
and
he
wanted
to
be
avenged
upon
you
wounds
to
the
vanity
never
heal
i
do
not
know
how
he
did
it
paul
but
he
made
me
help
him
in
his
schemes
i
could
have
prevented
you
from
going
to
the
bear
hunt
for
i
suspected
him
then
i
could
have
prevented
my
mother
from
inviting
him
to
thors
i
could
have
put
a
thousand
difficulties
in
his
way
but
i
did
not
i
helped
him
i
told
him
about
the
people
and
who
were
the
worst
who
had
been
influenced
by
the
nihilists
and
who
would
not
work
i
allowed
him
to
stay
on
here
and
carry
out
his
plan
all
this
trouble
among
the
peasants
is
his
handiwork
he
has
organized
a
regular
rising
against
you
he
is
horribly
clever
he
left
us
yesterday
but
i
am
convinced
that
he
is
in
the
neighborhood
still
she
stopped
and
reflected
there
was
something
wanting
in
the
story
which
she
could
not
supply
it
was
a
motive
a
is
almost
an
impossibility
when
we
speak
of
ourselves
it
must
be
all
or
nothing
preferably
nothing
i
do
not
know
why
i
did
it
she
said
it
was
a
sort
of
period
i
went
through
i
can
not
explain
he
did
not
ask
her
to
do
so
they
were
singularly
like
brother
and
sister
in
their
mental
attitude
they
had
driven
through
twenty
miles
of
forest
which
belonged
to
one
or
other
of
them
each
was
touched
by
the
intangible
inexplicable
dignity
that
belongs
to
the
possession
of
great
lands
to
the
inheritance
of
a
great
name
that
is
the
confession
she
said
he
gave
a
little
laugh
if
none
of
us
had
worse
than
that
upon
our
consciences
he
answered
there
would
be
little
harm
in
the
world
de
chauxville
schemes
have
only
hurried
on
a
crisis
which
was
foreordained
the
progress
of
humanity
can
not
be
stayed
they
have
tried
to
stay
it
in
this
country
they
will
go
on
trying
until
the
crash
comes
what
is
the
favor
you
have
to
ask
you
must
leave
osterno
she
urged
earnestly
it
is
unsafe
to
delay
even
a
few
hours
de
chauxville
said
there
would
be
no
danger
i
believed
him
then
but
i
do
not
now
besides
i
know
the
peasants
they
are
hard
to
rouse
but
once
excited
they
are
uncontrollable
they
are
afraid
of
nothing
you
must
get
away
paul
made
no
answer
she
turned
slowly
in
her
seat
and
looked
into
his
face
by
the
light
of
the
waning
moon
do
you
mean
that
you
will
not
go
he
met
her
glance
with
his
grave
slow
smile
there
is
no
question
of
going
he
answered
you
must
know
that
she
did
not
attempt
to
persuade
perhaps
there
was
something
in
his
voice
which
she
as
a
russian
understood
a
ring
of
that
which
we
call
in
others
it
must
be
splendid
to
be
a
man
she
said
suddenly
in
a
ringing
voice
one
feeling
in
me
made
me
ask
you
the
favor
while
another
was
a
sense
of
gladness
at
your
certain
refusal
i
wish
i
was
a
man
i
envy
you
you
do
not
know
how
i
envy
you
paul
paul
gave
a
quiet
laugh
such
a
laugh
as
one
hears
in
the
trenches
after
the
low
hum
of
a
passing
ball
if
it
is
danger
you
want
you
will
have
more
than
i
in
the
next
week
he
answered
steinmetz
and
i
knew
that
you
were
the
only
woman
in
russia
who
could
get
your
father
safely
out
of
the
country
that
is
why
i
came
for
you
the
girl
did
not
answer
at
once
they
were
driving
on
the
road
again
now
and
the
sleigh
was
running
smoothly
i
suppose
she
said
reflectively
at
length
that
the
secret
of
the
enormous
influence
you
exercise
over
all
who
come
in
contact
with
you
is
that
you
drag
the
best
out
of
every
one
the
best
that
is
in
them
paul
did
not
answer
what
is
that
light
she
asked
suddenly
laying
her
hand
on
the
thick
fur
of
his
sleeve
she
was
not
nervous
but
very
watchful
there
straight
in
front
it
is
the
sleigh
replied
paul
with
your
father
and
steinmetz
i
arranged
that
they
should
meet
us
at
the
you
must
be
at
the
volga
before
daylight
send
the
horses
on
to
tver
i
have
given
you
minna
and
the
warrior
they
can
do
the
journey
with
one
hour
rest
but
you
must
drive
them
catrina
had
swayed
forward
against
the
bar
of
the
apron
in
a
strange
way
for
the
road
was
quite
smooth
she
placed
her
gloved
hands
on
the
bar
and
held
herself
upright
with
a
peculiar
effort
what
said
paul
for
she
had
made
an
inarticulate
sound
nothing
she
answered
then
after
a
pause
i
did
not
know
that
we
were
to
go
so
soon
that
was
all
chapter
xlii
the
storm
bursts
the
large
was
brilliantly
lighted
another
weary
day
had
dragged
to
its
close
it
was
the
tuesday
evening
the
last
tuesday
in
march
five
years
ago
the
starosta
had
not
been
near
the
castle
all
day
steinmetz
and
paul
had
never
lost
sight
of
the
ladies
since
breakfast
time
they
had
not
ventured
out
of
doors
there
was
in
the
atmosphere
a
sense
of
foreboding
the
stillness
of
a
crisis
etta
had
been
defiant
and
silent
a
dangerous
humor
all
day
maggie
had
watched
paul
face
with
steadfast
quiet
eyes
full
of
courage
but
she
knew
now
that
there
was
danger
the
conversation
at
breakfast
and
luncheon
had
been
maintained
by
steinmetz
always
collected
and
a
little
humorous
it
was
now
dinner
time
the
whole
castle
was
brilliantly
lighted
as
if
for
a
great
assembly
of
guests
during
the
last
week
a
fuller
state
a
greater
ceremony
had
been
observed
by
paul
orders
and
steinmetz
had
thought
more
than
once
of
that
historical
event
which
appealed
to
his
admiration
most
the
indian
mutiny
maggie
was
in
the
alone
she
was
leaning
one
hand
and
arm
on
the
looking
thoughtfully
into
the
fire
the
rustle
of
silk
made
her
turn
her
head
it
was
etta
beautifully
dressed
with
a
white
face
and
eyes
dull
with
suspense
i
think
it
is
warmer
said
maggie
urged
by
a
sudden
necessity
of
speech
hampered
by
a
sudden
chill
at
the
heart
yes
answered
etta
and
she
shivered
for
a
moment
there
was
a
little
silence
and
etta
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
ten
minutes
to
seven
a
high
wind
was
blowing
the
first
of
the
equinoctial
gales
heralding
the
spring
the
sound
of
the
wind
in
the
great
chimney
was
like
the
moaning
of
high
rigging
at
sea
the
door
opened
and
steinmetz
came
in
etta
face
hardened
her
lips
closed
with
a
snap
steinmetz
looked
at
her
and
at
maggie
for
once
he
seemed
to
have
no
pleasantry
ready
for
use
he
walked
toward
a
table
where
some
books
and
newspapers
lay
in
pleasant
profusion
he
was
standing
there
when
paul
came
into
the
room
the
prince
glanced
at
maggie
he
saw
where
his
wife
stood
but
he
did
not
look
at
her
steinmetz
was
writing
something
on
half
a
sheet
of
notepaper
in
pencil
he
pushed
it
across
the
table
toward
paul
who
drew
it
nearer
to
him
are
you
armed
were
the
written
words
paul
crushed
the
paper
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
threw
it
into
the
fire
where
it
burned
away
he
also
glanced
at
the
clock
it
was
five
minutes
to
seven
suddenly
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
a
manservant
rushed
in
pale
confused
he
was
a
giant
footman
in
the
gorgeous
livery
of
the
alexis
excellency
he
stammered
in
russian
the
castle
is
surrounded
they
will
kill
us
they
will
burn
us
out
he
stopped
abashed
before
paul
pointing
finger
and
stony
face
leave
the
room
said
paul
you
forget
yourself
through
the
open
to
which
paul
pointed
peered
the
ashen
faces
of
other
servants
huddled
together
like
sheep
leave
the
room
repeated
paul
and
the
man
obeyed
him
walking
to
the
door
unsteadily
with
quivering
chin
on
the
threshold
he
paused
paul
stood
pointing
to
the
door
he
had
a
poise
of
the
head
some
sudden
awakening
of
the
blood
that
had
coursed
in
the
veins
of
hereditary
potentates
maggie
looked
at
him
she
had
never
known
him
like
this
she
had
known
the
man
she
had
never
encountered
the
prince
the
big
clock
over
the
castle
boomed
out
the
hour
and
at
the
same
instant
there
arose
a
roar
like
the
voice
of
the
surf
on
a
malabar
shore
there
was
a
crashing
of
glass
almost
in
the
room
itself
already
steinmetz
was
drawing
the
curtains
closer
over
the
windows
in
order
to
prevent
the
light
from
filtering
through
the
interstices
of
the
closed
shutters
only
stones
he
said
to
paul
with
his
grim
smile
it
might
have
been
bullets
as
if
in
corroboration
of
his
suggestion
the
sharp
ring
of
more
than
one
rang
out
above
the
dull
roar
of
many
voices
steinmetz
crossed
the
room
to
where
etta
was
standing
by
the
fire
her
clenched
hand
was
gripping
maggie
wrist
she
was
half
hidden
behind
her
cousin
maggie
was
looking
at
paul
etta
was
obviously
conscious
of
steinmetz
gaze
and
approach
i
asked
you
before
to
tell
me
all
you
knew
he
said
you
refused
will
you
do
it
now
etta
met
his
glance
for
a
moment
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
turned
her
back
on
him
paul
was
standing
in
the
open
with
his
back
turned
toward
them
alone
the
palace
had
never
looked
so
vast
as
it
did
at
that
moment
brilliantly
lighted
gorgeous
empty
through
the
hail
of
blows
on
the
stout
doors
the
rattle
of
stones
at
the
windows
the
prince
could
hear
yells
of
execration
and
the
wild
laughter
that
is
bred
of
destruction
he
turned
and
entered
the
room
his
face
was
gray
and
terrible
they
have
no
chance
he
said
of
effecting
an
entrance
by
force
the
lower
windows
are
barred
they
have
no
ladders
steinmetz
and
i
have
seen
to
that
we
have
been
expecting
this
for
some
days
he
turned
toward
steinmetz
as
if
seeking
confirmation
the
din
was
increasing
when
the
german
spoke
he
had
to
shout
we
can
beat
them
back
if
we
like
we
can
shoot
them
down
from
the
windows
but
he
paused
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
laughed
what
will
you
this
prince
will
not
shoot
his
father
serfs
we
must
leave
you
went
on
paul
we
must
beware
of
treachery
whatever
happens
we
shall
not
leave
the
house
if
the
worst
comes
we
make
our
last
stand
in
this
room
whatever
happens
stay
here
till
we
come
he
left
the
room
followed
by
steinmetz
there
were
only
three
doors
in
the
impregnable
stone
walls
the
great
entrance
a
side
door
for
use
in
times
of
deep
snow
and
the
small
concealed
entrance
by
which
the
starosta
was
in
the
habit
of
reaching
his
masters
for
a
moment
the
two
men
stood
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
listening
to
the
wild
commotion
they
were
turning
to
descend
the
state
stairs
when
a
piercing
shriek
immediately
drowned
by
a
yell
of
triumph
broke
the
silence
of
the
interior
of
the
castle
there
was
a
momentary
stillness
followed
by
another
shriek
they
are
in
said
steinmetz
the
side
door
and
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
with
wide
eyes
full
of
knowledge
as
they
ran
to
the
foot
of
the
broad
staircase
the
tramp
of
scuffling
feet
the
roar
of
angry
voices
came
through
the
passages
from
the
back
of
curtained
doorways
the
servants
quarters
seemed
to
be
pandemonium
the
sounds
approached
up
said
paul
and
they
ran
up
the
broad
staircase
side
by
side
there
they
stood
and
waited
in
a
moment
the
baize
doors
were
burst
open
and
a
scuffling
mass
of
men
and
women
poured
into
the
hall
a
very
sewer
of
humanity
a
yell
of
execration
signalized
their
recognition
of
the
prince
they
are
mad
said
steinmetz
as
the
crowd
surged
forward
toward
the
stairs
with
waving
arms
and
the
dull
gleam
of
steel
with
wild
faces
turned
upward
wild
mouths
bellowing
hatred
and
murder
it
is
a
chance
it
may
stop
them
said
steinmetz
his
arm
was
outstretched
steadily
a
loud
report
a
little
puff
of
smoke
shooting
upward
to
the
gilded
ceiling
and
for
one
brief
moment
the
crowd
stood
still
watching
one
of
their
ringleaders
who
was
turning
and
twisting
on
his
side
half
a
dozen
steps
from
the
bottom
the
man
writhed
in
silence
with
his
hand
to
his
breast
and
the
crowd
stood
aghast
he
held
up
his
hand
and
gazed
at
it
with
a
queer
stupefaction
the
blood
dripped
from
his
fingers
then
his
chin
went
up
as
if
some
one
was
gripping
the
back
of
his
neck
he
turned
over
slowly
and
rolled
to
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
then
paul
raised
his
voice
listen
to
me
he
said
but
he
got
no
farther
for
some
one
shot
at
him
from
the
background
over
the
frantic
heads
of
the
others
and
missed
him
the
bullet
lodged
in
the
wall
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
in
the
jamb
of
the
gorgeous
it
is
there
there
was
a
yell
of
hatred
and
an
ugly
charge
toward
the
stairs
but
the
sight
of
the
two
revolvers
held
them
there
motionless
for
a
few
moments
those
in
front
pushed
back
while
the
shouters
in
the
safe
background
urged
them
forward
by
word
and
gesture
two
men
holding
a
hundred
in
check
but
one
of
the
two
was
a
prince
which
makes
all
the
difference
and
will
continue
to
make
that
difference
despite
halfpenny
journalism
until
the
end
of
the
world
what
do
you
want
cried
paul
oh
i
will
wait
he
shouted
in
the
next
pause
there
is
plenty
of
time
when
you
are
tired
of
shouting
several
of
them
proceeded
to
tell
him
what
they
wanted
an
old
story
too
stale
for
repetition
here
paul
recognized
in
the
din
of
many
voices
the
tinkling
arguments
of
the
professional
agitator
all
the
world
over
the
cry
of
equality
equality
when
men
are
obviously
created
unequal
look
out
said
paul
i
believe
they
are
going
to
make
a
rush
all
the
while
the
foremost
men
were
edging
toward
the
stairs
while
the
densely
packed
throng
at
the
back
were
struggling
among
themselves
in
the
passages
behind
some
were
yelling
and
screaming
with
a
wild
intonation
which
steinmetz
recognized
he
had
been
through
the
commune
those
fellows
at
the
back
have
been
killing
some
one
he
said
i
can
tell
by
their
voices
they
are
drunk
with
the
sight
of
blood
some
new
orator
gained
the
ears
of
the
rabble
at
this
moment
and
the
heads
swayed
from
side
to
side
it
is
useless
he
cried
telling
him
what
you
want
he
will
not
give
it
you
go
and
take
it
go
and
take
it
little
fathers
that
is
the
only
way
steinmetz
raised
his
hand
and
peered
down
into
the
crowd
looking
for
the
man
of
eloquence
and
the
voice
was
hushed
at
this
moment
however
the
yelling
increased
and
through
the
leading
to
the
servants
quarters
came
a
stream
of
men
bloodstained
ragged
torn
they
were
waving
arms
and
implements
above
their
heads
down
with
the
aristocrats
kill
them
kill
them
they
were
shrieking
a
little
volley
of
further
excited
them
but
vodka
is
not
a
good
thing
to
shoot
upon
and
paul
stood
untouched
waiting
as
he
had
said
until
they
were
tired
of
shouting
now
yelled
steinmetz
to
him
in
english
we
must
go
we
can
make
a
stand
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
then
the
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
the
end
he
added
as
they
moved
up
the
stairs
step
by
step
backward
my
very
good
friend
he
went
on
at
the
door
we
must
begin
to
shoot
them
down
it
is
our
only
chance
it
is
moreover
our
duty
toward
the
ladies
there
is
one
alternative
answered
paul
the
moscow
doctor
yes
they
may
turn
said
paul
they
are
just
in
that
humor
the
were
the
most
dangerous
they
were
forcing
their
way
to
the
front
there
was
no
doubt
that
as
soon
as
they
could
penetrate
the
densely
packed
mob
they
would
charge
up
the
stairs
even
in
face
of
a
heavy
fire
the
reek
of
vodka
was
borne
up
in
the
heated
atmosphere
mingled
with
the
nauseating
odor
of
filthy
clothing
go
said
steinmetz
and
put
on
your
doctor
clothes
i
can
keep
them
back
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
paul
slipped
away
leaving
steinmetz
alone
at
the
summit
of
the
state
stairway
standing
grimly
revolver
in
hand
in
the
paul
found
maggie
alone
where
is
etta
he
asked
she
left
the
room
some
time
ago
but
i
told
her
to
stay
said
paul
to
this
maggie
made
no
answer
she
was
looking
at
him
with
an
anxious
scrutiny
did
they
shoot
at
you
she
asked
yes
but
not
straight
he
answered
with
a
little
laugh
as
he
hurried
on
in
a
few
moments
he
was
back
in
the
a
different
man
in
the
rough
stained
clothes
of
the
moscow
doctor
the
din
on
the
stairs
was
louder
steinmetz
was
almost
in
the
he
was
shooting
economically
picking
his
men
with
an
effort
paul
dragged
one
or
two
heavy
pieces
of
furniture
across
the
room
in
the
form
of
a
rough
barricade
he
pointed
to
the
hearthrug
where
maggie
was
to
stand
ready
he
shouted
to
steinmetz
come
the
german
ran
in
and
paul
closed
the
barricade
the
rabble
poured
in
at
the
open
door
screaming
and
shouting
bloodstained
ragged
wild
with
the
madness
of
murder
they
crowded
to
the
barricade
there
they
stopped
gazing
stupidly
at
paul
the
moscow
doctor
the
moscow
doctor
passed
from
lip
to
lip
it
was
the
women
who
shouted
it
the
loudest
like
the
wind
through
a
forest
it
swept
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
stairs
those
crowding
up
pushed
on
and
uttered
the
words
as
they
came
the
room
was
packed
with
them
yes
shouted
steinmetz
at
the
top
of
his
great
voice
and
the
prince
he
knew
the
note
to
strike
and
struck
with
a
sure
hand
the
barricade
was
torn
aside
and
the
people
swept
forward
falling
on
their
knees
grovelling
at
paul
feet
kissing
the
hem
of
his
garment
seizing
his
strong
hands
in
theirs
it
was
a
mighty
harvest
that
which
is
sown
in
the
people
hearts
bears
a
thousandfold
at
last
get
them
out
of
the
place
open
the
big
doors
said
paul
to
steinmetz
he
stood
cold
and
grave
among
them
some
of
them
were
already
sneaking
toward
the
door
the
ringleaders
the
talkers
from
the
towns
mindful
of
their
own
necks
in
this
change
of
feeling
steinmetz
hustled
them
out
bidding
them
take
their
dead
with
them
some
of
the
servants
reappeared
peeping
behind
curtains
when
the
last
villager
had
crossed
the
threshold
these
ran
forward
to
close
and
bar
the
great
doors
no
said
paul
from
the
head
of
the
stairs
leave
them
open
so
the
great
doors
stood
defiantly
open
the
lights
of
the
state
staircase
flared
out
over
the
village
as
the
peasants
crept
to
their
cottages
they
glanced
up
shamefacedly
but
they
had
no
word
to
say
steinmetz
in
the
looked
at
paul
with
his
resigned
shrug
of
the
shoulders
mein
lieber
he
said
yes
an
end
of
russia
for
us
answered
the
prince
he
moved
toward
the
door
leading
through
to
the
old
castle
i
am
going
to
look
for
etta
he
said
and
i
said
steinmetz
going
to
the
other
entrance
am
going
to
see
who
opened
the
side
door
chapter
xliii
behind
the
veil
will
you
come
with
me
said
paul
to
maggie
i
will
send
the
servants
to
put
this
room
to
rights
maggie
followed
him
out
of
the
room
and
together
they
went
through
the
passages
calling
etta
and
looking
for
her
there
was
an
air
of
gloom
and
chilliness
in
the
rooms
of
the
old
castle
the
outline
of
the
great
stones
dimly
discernible
through
the
was
singularly
suggestive
of
a
fortress
thinly
disguised
i
suppose
said
paul
that
etta
lost
her
nerve
yes
answered
maggie
doubtfully
i
think
it
was
that
paul
went
on
he
carried
a
lamp
in
one
steady
hand
we
shall
probably
find
her
in
one
of
these
rooms
he
said
it
is
so
easy
to
lose
one
self
among
the
passages
and
staircases
they
passed
on
through
the
great
with
its
hunting
trophies
the
lynx
with
its
face
of
claude
de
chauxville
grinned
at
them
darkly
from
its
pedestal
down
the
stairs
leading
to
the
side
door
they
met
steinmetz
coming
hastily
up
his
face
was
white
and
drawn
with
horror
you
must
not
go
down
here
he
said
in
a
husky
voice
barring
the
passage
with
his
arm
why
not
go
up
again
said
steinmetz
breathlessly
you
must
not
go
down
here
paul
laid
his
hand
on
the
broad
arm
stretched
across
the
stairway
for
a
moment
it
almost
appeared
to
be
a
physical
struggle
then
steinmetz
stepped
aside
i
beg
of
you
he
said
not
to
go
down
and
paul
went
on
followed
by
steinmetz
and
behind
them
maggie
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
a
broader
passage
led
to
the
side
door
and
from
this
other
passages
opened
into
the
servants
quarters
and
communicated
through
the
kitchens
with
the
modern
building
it
was
evident
that
the
door
leading
to
the
grassy
slope
at
the
back
of
the
castle
was
open
for
a
cold
wind
blew
up
the
stairs
and
made
the
lamps
flicker
at
the
end
of
the
passage
paul
stopped
steinmetz
was
a
little
behind
him
holding
maggie
back
the
two
lamps
lighted
up
the
passage
and
showed
the
white
form
of
the
princess
etta
lying
huddled
up
against
the
wall
the
face
was
hidden
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
beautiful
dress
and
hair
it
could
only
be
etta
paul
stooped
down
and
looked
at
her
but
he
did
not
touch
her
he
went
a
few
paces
forward
and
closed
the
door
beyond
etta
a
black
form
lay
across
the
passage
all
trodden
underfoot
and
dishevelled
paul
held
the
lamp
down
and
through
the
mud
and
blood
claude
de
features
were
outlined
death
is
always
unmistakable
though
it
be
shown
by
nothing
more
than
a
heap
of
muddy
clothes
claude
de
chauxville
was
lying
across
the
passage
he
had
been
trodden
underfoot
by
the
stream
of
maddened
peasants
who
had
entered
by
this
door
which
had
been
opened
for
them
whom
steinmetz
had
checked
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
by
shooting
their
ringleader
de
chauxville
scalp
was
torn
away
by
a
blow
probably
given
with
a
spade
or
some
blunt
instrument
his
hand
all
muddy
and
bloodstained
still
held
a
revolver
the
other
hand
was
stretched
out
toward
etta
who
lay
across
his
feet
crouching
against
the
wall
death
had
found
and
left
her
in
an
attitude
of
fear
shielding
her
bowed
head
from
a
blow
with
her
upraised
hands
her
loosened
hair
fell
in
a
long
wave
of
gold
down
to
the
bloodstained
hand
outstretched
toward
her
she
was
kneeling
in
de
chauxville
blood
which
stained
the
stone
floor
of
the
passage
paul
leaned
forward
and
laid
his
fingers
on
the
bare
arm
just
below
a
bracelet
which
gleamed
in
the
lamplight
she
was
quite
dead
he
held
a
lamp
close
to
her
there
was
no
mark
or
scratch
upon
her
arm
or
shoulder
the
blow
which
had
torn
her
hair
down
had
killed
her
without
any
disfigurement
the
silken
skirt
of
her
dress
which
lay
across
the
passage
was
trampled
and
stained
by
the
tread
of
a
hundred
feet
then
paul
went
to
claude
de
chauxville
he
stooped
down
and
slipped
his
skilled
fingers
inside
the
torn
and
clothing
here
also
was
death
paul
stood
upright
and
looked
at
them
as
they
lay
silent
motionless
with
their
tale
untold
maggie
and
steinmetz
stood
watching
him
he
went
to
the
door
which
was
of
solid
oak
four
inches
thick
and
examined
the
fastenings
there
had
been
no
damage
done
to
bolt
or
lock
or
hinge
the
door
had
been
opened
from
the
inside
he
looked
slowly
round
measuring
the
distances
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
he
said
at
length
to
steinmetz
in
a
dull
voice
maggie
winced
at
the
sound
of
it
steinmetz
did
not
answer
at
once
but
hesitated
after
the
manner
of
a
man
weighing
words
which
will
never
be
forgotten
by
their
hearers
it
seems
to
me
he
said
with
a
slow
wise
charity
the
best
of
its
kind
quite
clear
that
de
chauxville
died
in
trying
to
save
her
the
rest
must
be
only
guesswork
maggie
had
come
forward
and
was
standing
beside
him
and
in
guessing
let
us
be
charitable
is
it
not
so
he
said
turning
to
her
with
a
twist
of
his
humorous
lips
i
suppose
he
went
on
after
a
little
pause
that
claude
de
chauxville
has
been
at
the
bottom
of
all
our
trouble
all
his
life
he
has
been
one
of
the
stormy
petrels
of
diplomacy
wherever
he
has
gone
trouble
has
followed
later
by
some
means
he
obtained
sufficient
mastery
over
the
princess
to
compel
her
to
obey
his
orders
the
means
he
employed
were
threats
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
make
mischief
and
in
such
affairs
a
woman
is
so
helpless
that
we
may
well
forgive
that
which
she
may
do
in
a
moment
of
panic
i
imagine
that
he
frightened
the
poor
lady
into
obedience
to
his
command
that
she
should
open
this
door
before
dinner
when
we
were
all
in
the
i
noted
a
little
mark
of
dust
on
the
white
silk
skirt
of
her
dress
at
the
time
i
thought
only
that
her
maid
had
been
careless
perhaps
you
noticed
it
mademoiselle
ladies
note
such
things
he
turned
to
maggie
who
nodded
her
head
that
he
went
on
was
the
dust
of
these
old
passages
she
had
been
down
here
she
had
opened
this
door
he
spread
out
his
hands
in
deprecation
in
his
quaint
germanic
way
he
held
one
hand
out
over
the
two
motionless
forms
in
mute
prayer
that
they
might
be
forgiven
we
all
have
our
faults
he
said
who
are
we
to
judge
each
other
if
we
understood
all
we
might
pardon
the
two
strongest
human
motives
are
ambition
and
fear
she
was
ruled
by
both
i
myself
have
seen
her
under
the
influence
of
sudden
panic
i
have
noted
the
working
of
her
great
ambition
she
was
probably
deceived
at
every
turn
by
that
man
who
was
a
scoundrel
he
is
dead
and
death
is
understood
to
wipe
out
all
debts
if
i
were
a
better
man
than
i
am
i
might
speak
well
of
him
but
ach
gott
that
man
was
a
scoundrel
i
think
the
good
god
will
judge
between
them
and
forgive
that
poor
woman
she
must
have
repented
of
her
action
when
she
heard
the
clatter
of
the
rioters
all
round
the
castle
i
am
sure
she
did
that
i
am
sure
she
came
down
here
to
shut
the
door
and
found
claude
de
chauxville
here
they
were
probably
talking
together
when
the
poor
mad
fools
who
killed
them
came
round
to
this
side
of
the
castle
and
found
them
they
recognized
her
as
the
princess
they
probably
mistook
him
for
the
prince
it
is
what
men
call
a
series
of
coincidences
i
wonder
what
god
calls
it
he
broke
off
and
stooping
down
he
drew
the
lapel
of
the
cloak
gently
over
the
marred
face
and
let
us
remember
he
said
that
he
tried
to
save
her
some
lives
are
so
at
the
very
end
a
little
reparation
is
made
in
life
he
was
her
evil
genius
when
he
died
they
trampled
him
underfoot
in
order
to
reach
her
mademoiselle
will
you
come
he
took
maggie
by
the
arm
and
led
her
gently
away
she
was
shaking
all
over
but
his
hand
was
steady
and
wholly
kind
he
led
her
up
the
narrow
stairs
to
her
own
room
in
the
little
boudoir
the
fire
was
burning
brightly
the
lamps
were
lighted
just
as
the
maid
had
left
them
at
the
first
alarm
maggie
sat
down
and
quite
suddenly
she
burst
into
tears
steinmetz
did
not
leave
her
he
stood
beside
her
gently
stroking
her
shoulder
with
his
stout
fingers
he
said
nothing
but
the
gray
mustache
only
half
concealed
his
lips
which
were
twisted
with
a
little
smile
full
of
tenderness
and
sympathy
maggie
was
the
first
to
speak
i
am
all
right
now
she
said
please
do
not
wait
any
longer
and
do
not
think
me
a
very
person
poor
etta
steinmetz
moved
away
toward
the
door
yes
he
said
poor
etta
it
is
often
those
who
get
on
in
the
world
who
need
the
world
pity
most
at
the
door
he
stopped
he
said
i
will
take
you
home
to
england
is
that
agreeable
to
you
mademoiselle
she
smiled
at
him
sadly
through
her
tears
yes
i
should
like
that
she
said
this
country
is
horrible
you
are
very
kind
to
me
steinmetz
went
down
stairs
and
found
paul
at
the
door
talking
to
a
young
officer
who
slowly
dismounted
and
lounged
into
the
hall
conscious
of
his
brilliant
uniform
of
his
own
physical
capacity
to
show
off
any
uniform
to
full
advantage
he
was
a
lieutenant
in
a
cossack
regiment
and
as
he
bowed
to
steinmetz
whom
paul
introduced
he
swung
off
his
high
astrakhan
cap
with
a
flourish
showing
a
fair
boyish
face
yes
he
continued
to
paul
in
english
the
general
sent
me
over
with
a
sotnia
of
men
and
pretty
hungry
you
will
find
them
we
have
covered
the
whole
distance
since
daybreak
a
report
reached
the
old
gentleman
that
the
whole
countryside
was
about
to
rise
against
you
who
spread
the
report
asked
steinmetz
i
believe
it
originated
down
at
the
wharfs
it
has
been
traced
to
an
old
man
and
his
daughter
a
sort
of
pedler
i
think
who
took
a
passage
down
the
river
but
where
they
heard
the
rumor
i
do
know
paul
and
steinmetz
carefully
avoided
looking
at
each
other
they
knew
that
catrina
and
stépan
lanovitch
had
sent
back
assistance
of
course
said
paul
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
but
i
am
equally
glad
to
inform
you
that
you
are
not
wanted
steinmetz
will
tell
you
all
about
it
and
when
you
are
ready
for
dinner
it
will
be
ready
for
you
i
will
give
instructions
that
the
men
be
cared
for
thanks
the
funny
thing
is
that
i
am
instructed
with
your
approval
to
put
the
place
under
martial
law
and
take
charge
that
will
not
be
necessary
thanks
answered
paul
going
out
of
the
open
door
to
speak
to
the
cossacks
sent
for
his
protection
in
russia
as
in
other
countries
where
life
is
cheaply
held
the
death
formalities
are
small
it
is
only
in
england
where
we
are
so
careful
for
the
individual
and
so
careless
of
the
type
that
we
have
to
pay
for
dying
and
leave
a
mass
of
formalities
for
our
friends
while
the
young
officer
was
changing
his
uniform
for
the
evening
finery
which
his
servant
forethought
had
provided
paul
and
steinmetz
hurriedly
arranged
what
story
of
the
evening
should
be
given
to
the
world
knowing
the
country
as
they
did
they
were
enabled
to
tell
a
true
tale
which
was
yet
devoid
of
that
small
personal
interest
that
gossips
love
and
all
the
world
ever
knew
was
that
the
princess
howard
alexis
was
killed
by
the
revolted
peasants
while
attempting
to
escape
by
a
side
door
and
that
the
baron
claude
de
chauxville
who
was
staying
in
the
neighborhood
met
his
death
in
attempting
to
save
her
from
the
fury
of
the
mob
on
the
recommendation
of
karl
steinmetz
paul
placed
the
castle
and
village
under
martial
law
and
there
and
then
gave
the
command
to
the
young
cossack
officer
pending
further
instructions
from
his
general
commanding
at
tver
the
officer
dined
with
steinmetz
and
under
the
careful
treatment
of
that
diplomatist
inaugurated
a
reign
of
military
autocracy
which
varied
pleasingly
between
strict
discipline
and
boyish
neglect
before
the
master
of
the
situation
had
slept
off
the
effect
of
his
ride
and
a
heavy
dinner
the
next
morning
steinmetz
and
maggie
were
ready
to
start
on
their
journey
to
england
the
breakfast
was
served
in
the
room
abutting
on
the
cliff
in
the
dim
light
of
a
misty
morning
the
lamps
were
alight
on
the
table
and
paul
was
waiting
when
maggie
came
down
cloaked
for
her
journey
steinmetz
had
breakfasted
they
said
and
managed
to
talk
of
ordinary
things
until
maggie
was
supplied
with
coffee
and
toast
and
a
somewhat
heavy
manly
helping
of
a
then
came
a
silence
paul
broke
it
at
length
with
an
effort
standing
as
it
were
on
the
edge
of
the
forbidden
topic
steinmetz
will
take
you
all
the
way
he
said
and
then
come
back
to
me
you
can
safely
trust
yourself
to
his
care
yes
answered
the
girl
looking
at
the
food
set
before
her
with
a
helpless
stare
it
is
not
that
can
i
safely
trust
etta
memory
to
your
judgment
you
are
very
stern
paul
i
think
you
might
easily
misjudge
her
men
do
not
always
understand
a
woman
temptations
paul
had
not
sat
down
he
walked
away
to
the
window
and
stood
there
looking
out
into
the
gloomy
mists
it
is
not
because
she
was
my
cousin
said
maggie
from
the
table
it
is
because
she
was
a
woman
leaving
her
memory
to
be
judged
by
two
men
who
are
both
hard
paul
neither
looked
round
nor
answered
when
a
woman
has
to
form
her
own
life
and
renders
it
a
prominent
one
she
usually
makes
a
huge
mistake
of
it
said
the
girl
she
waited
a
moment
and
then
she
pleaded
once
more
hastily
for
she
heard
a
step
approaching
if
you
only
understood
every
thing
you
might
think
differently
it
is
because
you
can
not
understand
then
paul
turned
round
slowly
no
he
said
i
can
not
understand
it
and
i
do
not
think
that
i
ever
shall
and
steinmetz
came
into
the
room
in
a
few
minutes
the
sleigh
bearing
steinmetz
and
maggie
disappeared
into
the
gloom
closely
followed
by
a
couple
of
cossacks
acting
as
guard
and
carrying
despatches

chapter
xliv
kismet
between
brandon
in
suffolk
and
thetford
in
norfolk
runs
a
quiet
river
the
little
ouse
where
few
boats
break
the
stillness
of
the
water
on
either
bank
stand
whispering
and
so
low
is
the
music
of
the
leaves
that
the
message
of
ely
distant
bells
floats
through
them
on
a
quiet
evening
as
far
as
brandon
and
beyond
it
three
years
after
etta
death
in
the
glow
of
an
april
sunset
a
canadian
canoe
was
making
its
stealthy
way
up
the
river
the
paddle
crept
in
and
out
so
gently
so
lazily
and
peacefully
that
the
dabchicks
and
other
waterfowl
did
not
cease
their
chatter
of
nests
and
other
april
matters
as
the
canoe
glided
by
so
quiet
indeed
was
its
progress
that
karl
steinmetz
suddenly
as
strong
old
men
are
apt
to
find
themselves
did
not
heed
its
approach
he
was
sitting
on
the
bank
with
a
gun
a
little
rifle
lying
on
the
grass
beside
him
he
was
in
the
enjoyment
of
a
large
havana
cigar
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
peeping
through
the
lower
branches
made
him
blink
lazily
like
a
large
cat
he
turned
his
head
slowly
with
a
hunter
consciousness
of
the
approach
of
some
one
and
contemplated
the
canoe
with
a
sense
of
placid
satisfaction
the
small
craft
was
passing
in
the
shadow
of
a
great
tree
stealing
over
the
dark
unruffled
depth
a
girl
dressed
in
white
with
a
large
diaphanous
white
hat
and
a
general
air
of
brisk
english
daintiness
was
paddling
slowly
and
with
no
great
skill
a
picture
said
steinmetz
to
himself
with
teutonic
deliberation
gott
im
himmel
what
a
pretty
picture
to
make
an
old
man
young
then
his
gray
eyes
opened
suddenly
and
he
rose
to
his
feet
he
muttered
he
dragged
from
his
head
a
lamentable
old
straw
hat
and
swept
a
courteous
bow
mademoiselle
he
said
ah
what
happiness
after
three
years
maggie
stopped
and
looked
at
him
with
troubled
eyes
all
the
color
slowly
left
her
face
what
are
you
doing
here
she
asked
and
there
was
something
like
fear
in
her
voice
no
harm
mademoiselle
but
good
i
have
come
down
from
big
game
to
vermin
i
have
here
a
saloon
rifle
i
wait
till
a
comes
and
then
i
shoot
him
the
canoe
had
drifted
closer
to
the
land
the
paddle
trailing
in
the
water
you
are
looking
at
my
white
hairs
he
went
on
in
a
sudden
need
of
conversation
please
bring
your
boat
a
little
nearer
the
paddle
twisted
lazily
in
the
water
like
a
fish
tail
hold
tight
he
said
reaching
down
with
a
little
laugh
he
lifted
the
canoe
and
its
occupant
far
up
on
to
the
bank
despite
my
white
hairs
he
said
with
a
tap
of
both
hands
on
his
broad
chest
i
attach
no
importance
to
them
she
answered
taking
his
proffered
hand
and
stepping
over
the
light
bulwark
i
have
gray
ones
myself
i
am
getting
old
too
how
old
he
asked
looking
down
at
her
with
his
old
bluntness
ah
they
are
summers
he
said
mine
have
turned
to
winters
will
you
sit
here
where
i
was
sitting
see
i
will
spread
this
rug
for
your
white
dress
maggie
paused
looking
through
the
trees
toward
the
sinking
sun
the
light
fell
on
her
face
and
showed
one
or
two
lines
which
had
not
been
there
before
it
showed
a
patient
tenderness
in
the
steady
eyes
which
had
always
been
there
which
catrina
had
noticed
in
the
stormy
days
that
were
past
i
can
not
stay
long
she
replied
i
am
with
the
faneaux
at
brandon
for
a
few
days
they
dine
at
seven
ah
her
ladyship
is
a
good
friend
of
mine
you
remember
her
charity
ball
in
town
when
it
was
settled
that
you
should
come
to
osterno
a
strange
world
mademoiselle
a
very
strange
world
so
small
and
yet
so
large
and
bare
for
some
of
us
maggie
looked
at
him
then
she
sat
down
tell
me
she
said
all
that
has
happened
since
then
i
went
back
answered
steinmetz
and
we
were
duly
exiled
from
russia
it
was
sure
to
come
we
were
too
dangerous
altogether
too
quixotic
for
an
autocracy
for
myself
i
did
not
mind
but
it
hurt
paul
there
was
a
little
pause
while
the
water
lapped
and
whispered
at
their
feet
i
heard
said
maggie
at
length
in
a
measured
voice
that
he
had
gone
abroad
for
big
game
yes
to
india
he
did
not
go
to
america
enquired
maggie
indifferently
she
was
idly
throwing
fragments
of
wood
into
the
river
no
answered
steinmetz
looking
straight
in
front
of
him
no
he
did
not
go
to
america
and
you
i
oh
i
stayed
at
home
i
have
taken
a
house
it
is
behind
the
trees
you
can
not
see
it
i
live
at
peace
with
all
men
and
pay
my
bills
every
week
sometimes
paul
comes
and
stays
with
me
sometimes
i
go
and
stay
with
him
in
london
or
in
scotland
i
smoke
and
shoot
and
watch
the
younger
generation
making
the
same
mistakes
that
we
made
in
our
time
you
have
heard
that
my
country
is
in
order
again
they
have
remembered
me
for
my
sins
they
have
made
me
a
count
bon
dieu
i
do
not
mind
they
may
make
me
a
prince
if
it
pleases
them
he
was
watching
her
face
beneath
his
grim
old
eyebrows
these
details
bore
you
he
said
no
when
paul
and
i
are
together
we
talk
of
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
russia
but
it
will
not
come
in
our
time
we
are
only
the
sowers
and
the
harvest
is
not
yet
but
i
tell
paul
that
he
has
not
sown
wild
oats
nor
sour
grapes
nor
thistles
he
paused
and
the
expression
of
his
face
changed
to
one
of
gravity
mademoiselle
he
went
on
it
has
been
my
lot
to
love
the
prince
like
a
son
it
has
been
my
lot
to
stand
helplessly
by
while
he
passed
through
many
troubles
perhaps
the
good
god
gave
him
all
his
troubles
at
first
do
you
think
so
maggie
was
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
across
the
quiet
river
perhaps
so
she
said
steinmetz
also
stared
in
front
of
him
during
a
little
silence
the
common
thoughts
of
two
minds
may
well
be
drawn
together
by
the
contemplation
of
a
common
object
then
he
turned
toward
her
it
will
be
a
happiness
for
him
to
see
you
he
said
quietly
maggie
ceased
breaking
small
branches
and
throwing
them
into
the
river
she
ceased
all
movement
and
scarcely
seemed
to
breathe
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
he
is
staying
with
me
here
maggie
glanced
toward
the
canoe
she
drew
a
short
sharp
breath
but
she
did
not
move
mademoiselle
said
steinmetz
earnestly
i
am
an
old
man
and
in
my
time
i
have
dabbled
pretty
deeply
in
trouble
but
taking
it
all
around
even
my
life
has
had
its
compensations
and
i
have
seen
lives
which
taken
as
a
mere
mortal
existence
without
looking
to
the
hereafter
at
all
have
been
quite
worth
the
living
there
is
much
happiness
in
life
to
make
up
for
the
rest
but
that
happiness
must
be
firmly
held
it
is
so
easily
slipped
through
the
fingers
a
little
irresolution
a
little
want
of
moral
courage
a
little
want
of
a
little
pride
and
it
is
lost
you
follow
me
maggie
nodded
there
was
a
great
tenderness
in
her
eyes
such
a
tenderness
as
resting
on
men
may
bring
them
nearer
to
the
angels
steinmetz
laid
his
large
hand
over
hers
mademoiselle
he
went
on
i
believe
that
the
good
god
sent
you
along
this
lonely
river
in
your
boat
paul
leaves
me
his
arrangements
are
to
go
to
india
and
shoot
tigers
he
will
sail
in
a
week
there
are
things
of
which
we
never
speak
together
there
is
one
name
that
is
never
mentioned
since
osterno
you
have
avoided
meeting
him
god
knows
i
am
not
asking
for
him
any
thing
that
he
would
be
afraid
to
ask
for
himself
but
he
also
has
his
pride
he
will
not
force
himself
in
where
he
thinks
his
presence
unwelcome
steinmetz
rose
somewhat
ponderously
and
stood
looking
down
at
her
he
did
not
however
succeed
in
meeting
her
eyes
mademoiselle
he
said
i
beg
of
you
most
humbly
most
respectfully
to
come
through
the
garden
with
me
toward
the
house
so
that
paul
may
at
least
know
that
you
are
here
he
moved
away
and
stood
for
a
moment
with
his
back
turned
to
her
looking
toward
the
house
the
crisp
rustle
of
her
dress
came
to
him
as
she
rose
to
her
feet
without
looking
round
he
walked
slowly
on
the
path
through
the
trees
was
narrow
two
could
not
walk
abreast
after
a
few
yards
steinmetz
emerged
on
to
a
large
sloping
lawn
with
flower
beds
and
a
long
low
house
above
it
on
the
covered
terrace
a
man
sat
writing
at
a
table
he
was
surrounded
by
papers
and
the
pen
in
his
large
firm
hand
moved
rapidly
over
the
sheet
before
him
we
still
administer
the
estate
said
steinmetz
in
a
low
voice
from
our
exile
we
still
sow
our
seed
they
approached
over
the
mossy
turf
and
presently
paul
looked
up
a
strong
face
stern
and
the
face
of
a
man
who
would
always
have
a
purpose
in
life
who
would
never
be
petty
in
thought
or
deed
for
a
moment
he
did
not
seem
to
recognize
them
then
he
rose
and
the
pen
fell
on
the
flags
of
the
terrace
it
is
mademoiselle
said
steinmetz
and
no
other
word
was
spoken
maggie
walked
on
in
a
sort
of
unconsciousness
she
only
knew
that
they
were
all
acting
an
inevitable
part
written
for
them
in
the
great
libretto
of
life
she
never
noticed
that
steinmetz
had
left
her
side
that
she
was
walking
across
the
lawn
alone
paul
came
to
meet
her
and
took
her
hand
in
silence
there
was
so
much
to
say
that
words
seemed
suddenly
valueless
there
was
so
little
to
say
that
they
were
unnecessary
for
that
which
these
two
had
to
tell
each
other
can
not
be
told
in
minutes
nor
yet
in
years
it
can
not
even
be
told
in
a
lifetime
for
it
is
endless
and
it
runs
through
eternity
the
end
