preface
the
primary
aim
of
this
book
is
to
furnish
the
little
learner
reading
matter
that
will
excite
his
attention
and
give
him
pleasure
and
thus
make
lighter
the
difficult
task
of
learning
to
read
the
ruggedness
of
this
task
has
often
been
increased
by
the
use
of
disconnected
sentences
or
lessons
as
dry
and
uninteresting
as
finger
exercises
on
the
piano
it
is
a
sign
of
promise
that
the
demand
for
reading
matter
of
interest
to
the
child
has
come
from
teachers
i
have
endeavored
to
meet
this
requirement
in
the
following
stories
as
far
as
possible
the
words
chosen
have
been
such
as
are
not
difficult
to
the
little
reader
either
from
their
length
or
their
unfamiliarity
the
sentences
and
paragraphs
are
short
learning
to
read
is
like
climbing
a
steep
hill
and
it
is
a
great
relief
to
the
panting
child
to
find
frequent
breathing
places
it
is
one
of
the
purposes
of
these
stories
to
make
the
mind
of
the
pupil
familiar
with
some
of
the
leading
figures
in
the
history
of
our
country
by
means
of
personal
anecdote
some
of
the
stories
are
those
that
every
american
child
ought
to
know
because
they
have
become
a
kind
of
national
folklore
such
for
example
are
and
the
and
the
story
of
i
have
thought
it
important
to
present
as
great
a
variety
of
subjects
as
possible
so
that
the
pupil
may
learn
something
not
only
of
great
warriors
and
patriots
but
also
of
great
statesmen
the
exploits
of
discoverers
the
triumphs
of
american
inventors
and
the
achievements
of
men
of
letters
and
men
of
science
find
place
in
these
stories
all
the
narratives
are
historical
or
at
least
no
stories
have
been
told
for
true
that
are
deemed
fictitious
every
means
which
the
literary
experience
could
suggest
has
been
used
to
make
the
stories
engaging
in
the
hope
that
the
interest
of
the
narrative
may
prove
a
sufficient
spur
to
exertion
on
the
part
of
the
pupil
and
that
this
little
book
will
make
green
and
pleasant
a
pathway
that
has
so
often
been
dry
and
laborious
it
will
surely
serve
to
excite
an
early
interest
in
our
national
history
by
giving
some
of
the
great
personages
of
that
history
a
place
among
the
heroes
that
impress
the
susceptible
imagination
of
a
child
it
is
thus
that
biographical
and
historical
incidents
acquire
something
of
the
vitality
of
folk
tales
the
illustrations
that
accompany
the
text
have
been
planned
with
special
reference
to
the
awakening
of
the
attention
to
keep
the
mind
alert
and
at
its
best
is
more
than
half
the
battle
in
teaching
the
publishers
and
the
author
of
this
little
book
believe
that
in
laying
the
foundation
of
a
education
the
best
work
is
none
too
good
the
larger
words
have
been
divided
by
hyphens
when
a
separation
into
syllables
is
likely
to
help
the
learner
the
use
of
the
hyphen
has
been
regulated
entirely
with
a
view
to
its
utility
after
a
word
not
too
difficult
has
been
made
familiar
by
its
repeated
occurrence
the
hyphens
are
omitted

of
great
americans
illustration
the
first
governor
in
boston
before
the
white
people
came
there
were
no

them
the
friendly
indians
also
told
them
that
there
was
a
demon
in
one
part
of
the
river
they
said
that
this
demon
roared
so
loud
that
he
could
be
heard
a
long
way
off
they

the
demon
would

the
down
into
the
water
then
they
told
about
great
monsters
that

up
men
and
their
canoes
but
and
the
men
with
him
thought
they
would
risk

for
fear
of
the
demon
or
the
monsters
the
two
little
canoes
went
down
the
river
after
some
days
they
came
to
the
more
than
a
hundred
years
before
the
spaniards
had
seen
the
lower
part
of
this
river
but
no
white
man
had
ever
seen
this
part
of
the
great
river
did
not
know
that
any
white
man
had
ever
seen
any
part
of
the
the
two
little
canoes
now
turned
their
bows
down
the
river
they
saw
great
herds
of
some
of
these
came
to
the
bank
of
the
river
to
look
at
the
men
in
the
canoes
they
had
long
shaggy
manes
which
hung
down
over
their
eyes
for
two
weeks
the
paddled
down
the
river
in
all
this
time
they
did
not
see
any
indians
after
they
had
gone
hundreds
of
miles
in
this
way
they
came
to
a
place
where
they
saw
tracks
in
the
mud
it
was
in
what
is
now
the
state
of
and
left
the
men
in
their
canoes
and
followed
the
tracks
after
walking
two
hours
they
came
to
an
indian
village
the
frenchmen
came
near
enough
to
hear
the
indians
talking
the
indians
did
not
see
them
and
did
not
know
whether
the
indians
would
kill
them
or
not
they
said
a
short
prayer
then
they
stood
out
in
full
view
and
gave
a
loud
shout
the
indians
came
out
of
their
tents
like
bees
they
stared
at
the
strangers
then
four
indians
came
toward
them
these
indians
carried
a
peace
pipe
they
held
this
up
toward
the
sun
this
meant
that
they
were
friendly
the
indians
now
offered
the
peace
pipe
to
the
the
took
it
and
smoked
with
the
indians
this
was

indian
way
of
saying

asked
the
indians
what
tribe
they
belonged
to
they
told
him
that
they
were
of
the
tribe
called
the
they
took
and
into
their
village
they
came
to
the
door
of
a
large
a
chief
stood
in
the
door
he
shaded
his
eyes
with
both
hands
as
if
the
sun
were
shining
in
his
face
then
he
made
a
little
speech
he
said
how
bright
the
sun
shines
when
you
come
to
see
us
we
are
all
waiting
for
you
you
shall
now
come
into
our
houses
in
the
indians
made
a
feast
for
their
new
friends
first
they
had
mush
of
corn
meal
with
fat
meat
in
it
one
of
the
indians
fed
the
frenchmen
as
though
they
were
babies
he
put
mush
into
their
mouths
with
a
large
spoon
then
came
some
fish
the
indian
that
fed
the
picked
out
the
bones
with
his
fingers
then
he
put
the
pieces
of
fish
into
their
mouths
after
they
had
some
roasted
dog
the
did
not
like
this
last
they
were
fed
with
meat
the
next
morning
six
hundred
indians
went
to
the
canoes
to
tell
the
frenchmen
they
gave
a
young
indian
slave
and
they
gave
him
a
peace
pipe
to
carry
with
him
indian
pictures
when
and
his
men
left
the
they
went
on
down
the
river
the
friendly
had
told
them
that
the
indians
they
would
see
were
bad
and
that
they
would
kill
any
one
who
came
into
their
country
the
frenchmen
had
heard
before
this
that
there
were
demons
and
monsters
in
the
river
one
day
they
saw
some
high
rocks
with
pictures
painted
on
them
the
ugly
pictures
made
them
think
of
these
monsters
they
were
painted
in
red
black
and
green
colors
they
were
pictures
of
two
indian
demons
or
gods
each
one
of
these
monsters
was
about
the
size
of
a
calf
they
had
horns
as
long
as
those
of
a
deer
their
eyes
were
red
their
faces
were
like
a
but
they
were
ugly
and
frightful
they
had
beards
like
a
their
bodies
were
covered
with
scales
like
those
on
a
fish
their
long
tails
were
wound
round
their
bodies
and
over
their
heads
and
down
between
their
legs
the
end
of
each
tail
was
like
that
of
a
fish
the
indians
prayed
to
these
ugly
gods
when
they
passed
in
their
canoes
even
and
his
men
were
a
little
frightened
when
they
saw
such
pictures
in
a
place
so
lonely
the
frenchmen
went
down
the
river
about
twelve
hundred
miles
the
indians
tried
to
kill
them
but
by
showing
the
peace
pipe
they
made
friends
at
last
they
turned
back
went
to
preached
to
the
indians
in
the
west
till
he
died
william
penn
and
the
indians
the
king
of
england
gave
all
the
land
in
to
william
penn
the
king
made
penn
a
kind
of
king
over
penn
could
make
the
laws
of
this
new
country
but
he
let
the
people
make
their
own
laws
penn
wanted
to
be
friendly
with
the
indians
he
paid
them
for
all
the
land
his
people
wanted
to
live
on
before
he
went
to
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
indians
he
told
them
in
this
letter
that
he
would
not
let
any
of
his
people
do
any
harm
to
the
indians
he
said
he
would
punish
that
did
any
wrong
to
an
indian
this
letter
was
read
to
the
indians
in
their
own
soon
after
this
penn
got
into
a
ship
and
sailed
from
england
he
sailed
to
when
he
came
there
he
sent
word
to
the
tribes
of
indians
to
come
to
meet
him
the
indians
met
under
a
great
elm
tree
on
the
bank
of
the
river
indians
like
to
hold
their
solemn
meetings
out
of
doors
they
sit
on
the
ground
they
say
that
the
earth
is
the
mother
when
penn
came
to
the
place
of
meeting
he
found
the
woods
full
of
indians
as
far
as
he
could
see
there
were
crowds
of
indians
friends
were
few
they
had
no
guns
penn
had
a
bright
blue
sash
round
his
waist
one
of
the
indian
chiefs
who
was
the
great
chief
put
on
a
kind
of
cap
or
crown
in
the
middle
of
this
was
a
small
horn
the
head
chief
wore
this
only
at
such
great
meetings
as
this
one
when
the
great
chief
had
put
on
his
horn
all
the
other
chiefs
and
great
men
of
the
indians
put
down
their
guns
then
they
sat
down
in
front
of
penn
in
the
form
of
a
then
the
great
chief
told
penn
that
the
indians
were
ready
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
penn
had
a
large
paper
in
which
he
had
written
all
the
things
that
he
and
his
friends
had
promised
to
the
indians
he
had
written
all
the
promises
that
the
indians
were
to
make
to
the
white
people
this
was
to
make
them
friends
when
penn
had
read
this
to
them
it
was
explained
to
them
in
their
own
penn
told
them
that
they
might
stay
in
the
country
that
they
had
sold
to
the
white
people
the
land
would
belong
to
both
the
indians
and
the
white
people
then
penn
laid
the
large
paper
down
on
the
ground
that
was
to
show
them
he
said
that
the
ground
was
to
belong
to
the
indians
and
the
white
people
he
said
that
there
might
be
quarrels
between
some
of
the
white
people
and
some
of
the
indians
but
they
would
settle
any
quarrels
without
fighting
there
should
be
a
quarrel
the
indians
were
to
pick
out
six
indians
the
white
people
should
also
pick
out
six
of
their
men
these
were
to
meet
and
settle
the
quarrel
penn
said
will
not
call
you
my
children
because
fathers
whip
their
children
i
will
not
call
you
brothers
because
brothers
sometimes
fall
out
but
i
will
call
you
the
same
person
as
the
white
people
we
are
the
two
parts
of
the
same
the
indians
could
not

penn
took
up
the
great
paper
from
the
ground
he
handed
it
to
the
great
chief
that
wore
the
horn
on
his
head
he
told
the
indians
to
keep
it
and
hand
it
to
their
children
that
they
might
know
what
he
had
said
then
he
gave
them
many
presents
of
such
things
as
they
liked
they
gave
penn
a
name
in
their
own
language
they
named
him
that
was
their
word
for
a
feather
as
the
white
people
used
a
pen
made
out
of
a
quill
or
feather
they
called
a
pen
that
is
why
they
called
william
penn
penn
sometimes
went
to
see
the
indians
he
talked
to
them
and
gave
them
friendly
advice
once
he
saw
some
of
them
jumping
they
were
trying
to
see
who
could
jump
the
farthest
penn
had
been
a
very
active
boy
he
knew
how
to
jump
very
well
he
went
to
the
place
where
the
indians
were
jumping
he
jumped
farther
than
any
of
them
when
the
great
took
part
in
their
sport
the
indians
were
pleased
they
loved
brother
more
than
ever
one
little
bag
of
rice
the
first
white
people
that
came
to
this
country
hardly
knew
how
to
get
their
living
here
they
did
not
know
what
would
grow
best
in
this
country
many
of
the
white
people
learned
to
hunt
all
the
land
was
covered
with
trees
in
the
woods
were
many
animals
whose
flesh
was
good
to
eat
there
were
deer
and
bears
and
great
shaggy
there
were
rabbits
and
squirrels
and
there
were
many
kinds
of
birds
the
hunters
shot
wild
ducks
wild
turkeys
wild
geese
and
pigeons
the
people
also
caught
many
fishes
out
of
the
rivers
then
there
were
animals
with
fur
on
their
backs
the
people
killed
these
and
sold
their
skins
in
this
way
many
made
their
living
other
people
spent
their
time
in
cutting
down
the
trees
they
sawed
the
trees
into
timbers
and
boards
some
of
it
they
split
into
staves
to
make
barrels
they
sent
the
staves
and
other
sorts
of
timber
to
other
countries
to
be
sold

made

and

there
was
a
wise
man
in

he
was
one
of
those
men
that
find
out
better
ways
of
doing
his
name
was
thomas
smith
thomas
smith
had
once
lived
in
a
large
island
thousands
of
miles
away
from
south
in
that
island
he
had
seen
the
people
raising
rice
he
saw
that
it
was
planted
in
wet
ground
he
said
that
he
would
like
to
try
it
in
south
but
he
could
not
get
any
seed
rice
to
plant
the
rice
that
people
eat
is
not
fit
to
sow
one
day
a
ship
came
to
where
thomas
smith
lived
it
had
been
driven
there
by
storms
the
ship
came
from
the
large
island
where
smith
had
seen
rice
grow
the
captain
of
this
ship
was
an
old
friend
of
smith
the
two
old
friends
met
once
more
thomas
smith
told
the
captain
that
he
wanted
some
rice
for
seed
the
captain
called
the
cook
of
his
ship
and
asked
him
if
he
had
any
the
cook
had
one
little
bag
of
seed
rice
the
captain
gave
this
to
his
friend
there
was
some
wet
ground
at
the
back
of
garden
in
this
wet
ground
he
sowed
some
of
the
rice
it
grew
finely
he
gathered
a
good
deal
of
rice
in
his
garden
that
year
he
gave
part
of
this
to
his
friends
they
all
sowed
it
the
next
year
there
was
a
great
deal
of
rice
after
a
while
the
wet
land
in
south
was
turned
to
rice
fields
every
year
many
thousands
of
barrels
of
rice
were
sent
away
to
be
sold
all
this
came
from
one
little
bag
of
rice

one
wise

the
story
of
a
wise
woman
you
have
read
how
thomas
smith
first
raised
rice
in
after
his
death
there
lived
in
south
a
wise
young
woman
she
showed
the
people
how
to
raise
another
plant
her
name
was
eliza
lucas
the
father
of
miss
lucas
did
not
live
in
he
was
of
one
of
the
islands
of
the
west
indies
miss
lucas
was
fond
of
trying
new
things
she
often
got
seeds
from
her
father
these
she
planted
in
south
carolina
her
father
sent
her
some
seeds
of
the
plant
she
sowed
some
of
these
in
march
but
there
came
a
frost
the
plant
can
not
stand
frost
her
plants
all
died
but
miss
lucas
did
not
give
up
she
sowed
some
more
seeds
in
april
these
grew
very
well
until
a
found
them
the
worm
wished
to
try
new
things
too
so
he
ate
off
the
plants
but
miss
lucas
was
one
of
the
people
who
try
try
again
she
had
lost
her
indigo
plants
twice
once
more
she
sowed
some
of
the
seed
this
time
the
plants
grew
very
well
miss
lucas
wrote
to
her
father
about
it
he
sent
her
a
man
who
knew
how
to
get
the
indigo
out
of
the
plant
the
man
tried
not
to
show
miss
lucas
how
to
make
the
indigo
he
did
not
wish
the
people
in
south
carolina
to
learn
how
to
make
it
he
was
afraid
his
own
people
would
not
get
so
much
for
their
indigo
so
he
would
not
explain
just
how
it
ought
to
be
done
he
spoiled
the
indigo
on
purpose
but
miss
lucas
watched
him
closely
she
found
out
how
the
indigo
ought
to
be
made
some
of
her
land
in
south
carolina
was
now
planted
with
the
indigo
plants
illustration

then
miss
lucas
was
married
she
became
her
father
gave
her
all
the
indigo
growing
on
his
land
in
south
carolina
it
was
all
saved
for
seed
some
of
the
seed
gave
to
her
friends
some
of
it
her
husband
sowed
it
all
grew
and
was
made
into
that
blue
dye
that
we
call
indigo
when
it
is
used
in
washing
clothes
it
is
called
bluing
in
a
few
years
more
than
a
million
pounds
of
indigo
were
made
in
south
carolina
every
year
many
people
got
rich
by
it
and
it
was
all
because
miss
lucas
did
not
give
up
franklin
his
own
teacher
few
people
ever
knew
so
many
things
as
franklin
men
said
did
he
ever
learn
so
many
things
for
he
had
been
a
poor
boy
who
had
to
work
for
a
living
he
could
not
go
to
school
at
all
after
he
was
ten
years
old
his
father
made
soap
and
candles
little
ben
had
to
cut
wicks
for
the
candles
he
also
filled
the
candle
molds
and
he
sold
soap
and
candles
and
ran
on
errands
but
when
he
was
not
at
work
he
spent
his
time
in
reading
good
books
what
little
money
he
got
he
used
to
buy
books
with
he
read
the
old
story
of
and
liked
it
so
well
that
he
bought
all
the
other
stories
by
the
same
man
but
as
he
wanted
more
books
and
had
not
money
to
buy
them
he
sold
all
of
these
books
the
next
he
bought
were
some
little
books
these
were
made
to
sell
very
cheap
and
they
were
sold
by
peddlers
he
managed
to
buy
forty
or
fifty
of
these
little
books
of
another
way
that
he
had
of
learning
was
by
seeing
things
with
his
own
eyes
his
father
took
him
to
see
at
work
with
their
saws
and
planes
he
also
saw
masons
laying
bricks
and
he
went
to
see
men
making
brass
and
copper
kettles
and
he
saw
a
man
with
a
turning
lathe
making
the
round
legs
of
chairs
other
men
were
at
work
making
knives
some
things
people
learn
out
of
books
and
some
things
they
have
to
see
for
as
he
was
fond
of
books
father
thought
that
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
send
him
to
learn
to
print
them
so
the
boy
went
to
work
in
his
printing
office
here
he
passed
his
spare
time
in
reading
he
borrowed
some
books
out
of
the
stores
where
books
were
sold
he
would
sit
up
a
great
part
of
the
night
sometimes
to
read
one
of
these
books
he
wished
to
return
it
when
the
opened
in
the
morning
one
man
who
had
many
books
lent
to
ben
such
of
his
books
as
he
wanted
it
was
part
of
the
bargain
that
brother
should
pay
his
board
the
boy
offered
to
board
himself
if
his
brother
would
give
him
half
what
it
cost
to
pay
for
his
board
illustration
franklin
at
study
his
brother
was
glad
to
do
this
and
ben
saved
part
of
the
money
and
bought
books
with
it
he
was
a
healthy
boy
and
it
did
not
hurt
him
to
live
mostly
on
bread
and
butter
sometimes
he
bought
a
little
pie
or
a
handful
of
raisins
long
before
he
was
a
man
people
said
much
the
boy
knows
this
was
he
did
not
waste
his
time
he
read
good
books
he
saw
things
for
himself
how
franklin
found
out
things
thought
that
ants
know
how
to
tell
things
to
one
another
he
thought
that
they
talk
by
some
kind
of
signs
when
an
ant
has
found
a
dead
fly
too
big
for
him
to
drag
away
he
will
run
off
and
get
some
other
ant
to
help
him
thought
that
ants
have
some
way
of
telling
other
ants
that
there
is
work
to
do
one
day
he
found
some
ants
eating
out
of
a
little
jar
in
a
closet
he
shook
them
out
then
he
tied
a
string
to
the
jar
and
hung
it
on
a
nail
in
the
ceiling
but
he
had
not
got
all
the
ants
out
of
the
jar
one
little
ant
liked
sweet
things
so
well
that
he
staid
in
the
jar
and
kept
on
eating
like
a
greedy
boy
illustration
ants
talking
magnified
at
last
when
this
greedy
ant
had
eaten
all
that
he
could
he
started
to
go
home
saw
him
climb
over
the
rim
of
the
jar
then
the
ant
ran
down
the
outside
of
the
jar
but
when
he
got
to
the
bottom
he
did
not
find
any
shelf
there
he
went
all
round
the
jar
there
was
no
way
to
get
down
to
the
floor
the
ant
ran
this
way
and
that
way
but
he
could
not
get
down
illustration
an
ants
feeler
magnified
at
last
the
greedy
ant
thought
he
would
see
if
he
could
go
up
he
climbed
up
the
string
to
the
ceiling
then
he
went
down
the
wall
he
came
to
his
own
hole
at
last
no
doubt
after
a
while
he
got
hungry
again
perhaps
he
thought
about
that
jar
of
sweets
at
the
end
of
a
string
then
perhaps
he
told
the
other
ants
maybe
he
let
them
know
that
there
was
a
string
by
which
they
could
get
down
to
the
jar
in
about
half
an
hour
after
the
ant
had
gone
up
the
string
franklin
saw
a
swarm
of
ants
going
down
the
string
they
marched
in
a
line
one
after
another
soon
there
were
two
lines
of
ants
on
the
string
the
ants
in
one
line
were
going
down
to
get
at
the
sweet
food
the
ants
in
the
other
line
were
marching
up
the
other
side
of
the
string
to
go
home
do
you
think
that
the
greedy
ant
told
the
other
ants
about
the
jar
and
did
he
tell
them
that
there
was
a
string
by
which
an
ant
could
get
there
and
did
he
tell
it
by
speaking
or
by
signs
that
he
made
with
his
feelers
if
you
watch
two
ants
when
they
meet
you
will
see
that
they
touch
their
feelers
together
as
if
they
said
illustration
franklin
asks
the
sunshine
something
one
day
franklin
was
eating
dinner
at
the
house
of
a
friend
the
lady
of
the
house
when
she
poured
out
the
coffee
found
that
it
was
not
hot
she
said
am
sorry
that
the
coffee
is
cold
it
is
because
the
servant
forgot
to
scour
the
coffee
gets
cold
more
quickly
when
the
is
not
this
set
franklin
to
thinking
he
thought
that
a
black
or
dull
thing
would
cool
more
quickly
than
a
white
or
bright
one
that
made
him
think
that
a
black
thing
would
take
in
heat
more
quickly
than
a
white
one
he
wanted
to
find
out
if
this
were
true
or
not
there
was
who
knew
so
there
was
to
ask
but
franklin
thought
that
he
would
ask
the
sunshine
maybe
the
sunshine
would
tell
him
whether
a
black
thing
would
heat
more
quickly
than
a
white
thing
but
how
could
he
ask
the
sunshine
there
was
snow
on
the
ground
franklin
spread
a
white
cloth
on
the
snow
then
he
spread
a
black
cloth
on
the
snow
near
the
white
one
when
he
came
to
look
at
them
he
saw
that
the
snow
under
the
black
cloth
melted
away
much
sooner
than
that
under
the
white
cloth
that
is
the
way
that
the
sunshine
told
him
that
black
would
take
in
heat
more
quickly
than
white
after
he
had
found
this
out
many
people
got
white
hats
to
wear
in
the
summer
time
a
white
hat
is
cooler
than
a
black
one
some
time
when
there
is
snow
on
the
ground
you
can
take
a
white
and
a
black
cloth
and
ask
the
sunshine
the
same
question
franklin
and
the
kite
when
franklin
wanted
to
know
whether
the
ants
could
talk
or
not
he
asked
the
ants
and
they
told
him
when
he
wanted
to
know
else
he
asked
the
sunshine
about
it
as
you
have
read
in
another
story
that
is
the
way
that
franklin
came
to
know
so
many
things
he
knew
how
to
ask
questions
of
once
he
asked
the
a
question
and
the
gave
him
an
answer
before
the
time
of
franklin
people
did
not
know
what
was
they
did
not
know
what
made
the
thunder
franklin
thought
much
about
it
at
last
he
proved
what
it
was
he
asked
the
lightning
a
question
and
made
it
tell
what
it
was
to
tell
you
this
story
i
shall
have
to
use
one
big
word
maybe
it
is
too
big
for
some
of
my
little
friends
that
will
read
this
book
let
us
divide
it
into
parts
then
you
will
not
be
afraid
of
it
the
big
word
is
those
of
you
who
live
in
towns
have
seen
the
streets
lighted
by
but
in
time
there
were
no
such
lights
people
knew
very
little
about
this
strange
thing
with
a
big
name
but
franklin
found
out
many
things
about
it
that
nobody
had
ever
known
before
he
began
to
think
that
the
little
sparks
he
got
from
were
small
flashes
of
lightning
he
thought
that
the
little
cracking
sound
of
these
sparks
was
a
kind
of
baby
thunder
so
he
thought
that
he
would
try
to
catch
a
little
bit
of
lightning
perhaps
he
could
put
it
into
one
of
the
little
bottles
used
to
hold
then
if
it
behaved
like
he
would
know
what
it
was
but
catching
lightning
is
not
easy
how
do
you
think
he
did
it
first
he
made
a
kite
it
was
not
a
kite
just
like
a
kite
he
wanted
a
kite
that
would
fly
when
it
rained
rain
would
spoil
a
paper
kite
in
a
minute
so
franklin
used
a
silk
to
cover
his
kite
instead
of
paper
illustration
discovery
he
put
a
little
wire
at
the
top
of
his
kite
this
was
a
kind
of

shed
and
he
sent
his
kite
up
in
the

after
a
while
he
held
his
knuckle
to
the
key
a
tiny
spark
flashed
between
the
key
and
his
knuckle
it
was
a
little
flash
of
lightning
then
he
took
his
little
bottle
fixed
to
hold
he
filled
it
with
the
that
came
from
the
key
he
carried
home
a
bottle
of
lightning
so
he
found
out
what
made
it
thunder
and
lighten
after
that
he
used
to
bring
the
lightning
into
his
house
on
rods
and
wires
he
made
the
lightning
ring
bells
and
do
many
other
strange
things
whistle
when
franklin
was
an
old
man
he
wrote
a
letter
in
that
letter
he
told
a
story
it
was
about
that
happened
to
him
when
he
was
a
boy
illustration
here
is
the
story
put
into
verses
so
that
you
will
it
better
some
day
you
can
read
the
story
as
franklin
told
it
himself
you
will
hear
people
say
paid
too
much
for
the
the
saying
came
from
this
story
too
much
for
the
whistle
as
ben
with
pennies
in
his
pocket
went
strolling
down
the
street
there
came
a
whistle
from
a
boy
he
chanced
to
meet
whistling
fit
to
burst
his
buttons
blowing
hard
and
stepping
high
then
benny
said
buy
your
whistle
but
was
the
reply
but
benny
counted
out
his
pennies
the
whistling
boy
began
to
smile
with
one
last
toot
he
gave
the
whistle
to
ben
and
took
his
penny
pile
now
homeward
goes
the
whistling
benny
as
proud
as
any
foolish
boy
and
in
his
pockets
not
a
penny
but
in
his
mouth
a
noisy
toy
benny
benny
cries
his
mother
can
not
stand
your
ugly
benny
benny
says
his
father
can
not
talk
you
drown
my
at
last
the
whistling
boy
how
much
his
money
might
have
bought
many
pennies
for
a
whistle
is
little
ugly
thought
too
many
pennies
for
a
whistle
is
what
we
all
pay
you
and
i
just
for
a
little
foolish
pleasure
pay
a
price
quite
too
high

stark
and
the
indians
john
stark
was
a

far
away
from

men
set
traps
for
animals
in
many
places
they
wanted
to
catch
the
animals
that
have
fur
on
them
they
wanted
to
get
the
skins
to
sell
the
indians
were
at
war
with
the
white
people
one
day
the
young
men
saw
the
tracks
of
indians
then
they
knew
that
it
was
not
safe
for
them
to
stay
in
the
woods
any
longer
they
began
to
get
ready
to
go
home
john
stark
went
out
to
bring
in
the
traps
set
for
animals
the
indians
found
him
and
made
him
a
they
asked
him
where
his
friends
were
stark
did
not
wish
his
friends
to
be
taken
so
he
pointed
the
wrong
way
he
took
the
indians
a
long
way
from
the
other
young
men
but
john
friends
did
not
know
that
he
was
a
when
he
did
not
come
back
they
thought
that
he
had
lost
his
way
they
fired
their
guns
to
let
him
know
where
they
were
when
the
indians
heard
the
guns
they
knew
where
the
other
hunters
were
they
went
down
to
the
river
and
waited
for
them
when
one
of
the
men
came
down
they
caught
him
then
john
brother
and
the
other
man
came
down
the
river
in
a
boat
the
indians
told
stark
to
call
them
they
wanted
them
to
come
over
where
the
indians
were
then
they
could
take
them
john
knew
that
the
indians
were
cruel
he
knew
that
if
he
did
not
do
what
they
told
him
to
they
might
kill
him
but
he
wished
to
save
his
brother
he
called
to
his
brother
to
row
for
the
other
shore
when
they
turned
toward
the
other
shore
the
indians
fired
at
them
but
stark
knocked
up
two
of
their
guns
they
did
not
hit
the
white
men
then
some
of
the
other
indians
fired
stark
knocked
up
their
guns
also
but
the
man
that
was
with
his
brother
was
killed
john
now
called
to
his
brother
for
all
the
guns
are
his
brother
got
away
the
indians
were
very
angry
with
john
they
did
not
kill
him
but
they
gave
him
a
good
beating
these
indians
were
from
they
took
their
to
their
own
village
when
they
were
coming
home
they
shouted
to
let
the
people
know
that
they
had
prisoners
illustration
stark
running
the
gauntlet
the
young
indian
stood
in
two
rows
in
the
village
each
prisoner
had
to
run
between
these
two
rows
of
indians
as
he
passed
every
one
of
the
indians
hit
him
as
hard
as
he
could
with
a
stick
or
a
club
or
a
stone
the
young
man
who
was
with
stark
was
badly
hurt
in
running
between
these
lines
but
john
stark
knew
the
indians
he
knew
that
they
liked
a
brave
man
when
it
came
his
turn
to
run
he
snatched
a
club
from
one
of
the
indians
with
this
club
he
fought
his
way
down
the
lines
he
hit
hard
now
on
this
side
and
now
on
that
the
young
indians
got
out
of
his
way
the
old
indians
who
were
looking
on
sat
and
laughed
at
the
others
they
said
that
stark
was
a
brave
man
one
day
the
indians
gave
him
a
hoe
and
told
him
to
hoe
corn
he
knew
that
the
indian
would
not
work
they
think
it
a
shame
for
a
man
to
work
their
work
is
left
for
slaves
and
women
so
stark
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
hoe
he
dug
up
the
corn
instead
of
the
weeds
then
he
threw
the
hoe
into
the
river
he
said
is
work
for
slaves
and
then
the
indians
were
pleased
with
him
they
called
him
the
young
chief
after
a
while
some
white
men
paid
the
indians
a
hundred
and
three
dollars
to
let
stark
go
home
they
charged
more
for
him
than
for
the
other
man
because
they
thought
that
he
must
be
a
young
chief
stark
went
hunting
again
he
had
to
get
some
furs
to
pay
back
the
money
the
men
had
paid
the
indians
for
him
he
took
good
care
that
the
indians
should
not
catch
him
again
he
became
a
great
fighter
against
the
indians
he
had
learned
their
ways
while
he
was
among
them
he
knew
better
how
to
fight
them
than
almost
else
in
the
he
was
a
he
fought
the
british
at
and
won
a
great
a
great
good
man
some
men
are
great
soldiers
some
are
great
some
men
write
great
books
some
men
make
great
some
men
are
great
speakers
now
you
are
going
to
read
about
a
man
that
was
great
in
none
of
these
things
he
was
not
a
soldier
he
was
not
a
great
speaker
he
was
never
rich
he
was
a
poor
he
never
held
any
office
and
yet
he
was
a
great
man
he
was
great
for
his
goodness
he
was
born
in
france
but
most
of
his
life
was
passed
in
before
the
he
was
years
old
when
he
became
a
he
thought
that
he
could
do
more
good
in
teaching
than
in
any
other
way
in
his
time
were
not
like
our
teachers
children
were
treated
like
little
animals
in
old
times
the
was
a
little
king
he
walked
and
talked
as
if
he
knew
he
wanted
all
the
children
to
be
afraid
of
him
but
was
not
that
kind
of
man
he
was
very
gentle
he
treated
the
children
more
kindly
than
their
fathers
and
mothers
did
nobody
in
this
country
had
ever
seen
a
teacher
like
him
he
built
a
for
the
children
of
his
school
he
used
to
take
them
to
this
room
during
school
time
for
a
little
he
each
child
as
he
found
best
some
he
could
persuade
to
be
good
some
he
shamed
into
being
good
but
this
was
very
from
the
cruel
beatings
that
other
teachers
of
that
time
gave
their
pupils
of
course
the
children
came
to
love
him
very
much
after
they
grew
to
be
men
and
women
they
kept
their
love
for
the
good
little
schoolmaster
as
long
as
they
lived
they
listened
to
his
advice
there
were
no
good
in
his
time
he
wrote
some
little
books
to
make
learning
easier
to
his
pupils
he
taught
them
many
things
not
in
their
books
he
taught
them
to
be
kind
to
brutes
and
gentle
with
one
another
he
taught
them
to
be
noble
he
made
them
despise
every
kind
of
meanness
he
was
a
great
teacher
that
is
better
than
being
a
great
soldier
was
a
good
man
in
many
ways
he
was
the
friend
of
all
poor
people
once
he
found
a
poor
man
with
cold
for
want
of
a
coat
he
took
off
his
own
coat
in
the
street
and
put
it
on
the
poor
man
and
then
went
home
in
his
shirt

those
days

were
stolen
from
to
be
sold
into

little
books
against
this
wrong
he
sent
these
books
over
all
the
world
almost
he
also
tried
to
persuade
the
white
men
of
his
own
country
to
be
honest
and
kind
with
the
indians
great
men
in
other
countries
were
pleased
with
his
books
they
wrote
him
letters
when
any
of
them
came
to
this
country
they
went
to
see
him
they
wanted
to
see
a
man
that
was
good
to
everybody

house
was
a
plain
one
but

much
trouble

thought
that
benezet
was
only
trying
to
get
a
chance
to
sell
the
acadians
for
slaves
when
benezet
heard
this
he
had
a
good
laugh

that
she
was
in
trouble

right
away
to
see
the
that

in
command
of
the
soldiers
the
good
man
was
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
forgot
to
get
a
pass
the
soldiers
at

not
let

go
in
at
last
some
one
told
the
that
a
fellow
wanted
to
see
him

come
up
said
the
general
the
odd
little
man
came
in
he
told
the
general
all
about
the
troubles
of
the
poor
the
general
sent
word
that
the
soldiers
must
not
stay
any
longer
in
her
house
the
general
liked
the
kind
little
man
he
told
him
to
come
to
see
him
again
he
told
the
soldiers
at
his
door
to
let
benezet
come
in
he
wished
to
soon
after
the
was
over

when
the
people
of
heard

was
ill
they
gathered
in
crowds
about
his
house

him
wanted
to
know
whether
he
was
better
or
not
at
last
the
doctors
said
he
could
not
get

then
the
people
wished
to
see
the
good
man
once
more
the
doors
were
opened
the
rooms
and
halls
of
his
house
were
filled
with
people
coming
to
say
to
benezet
and
going
away
again
when
he
was
buried
it
seemed
as
if
all
had
come
to
his
the
rich
and
the
poor
the
black
and
the
white
crowded
the
streets
the
city
had
never
seen
so
great
a
in
the
company
was
an
general
he
said
would
rather
be
benezet
in
that
coffin
than
general
in
all
his
putnam
and
the
wolf
putnam
was
a
brave
soldier
he
fought
many
battles
against
the
indians
after
that
he
became
a
general
in
the
revolution
but
this
is
a
story
of
his
battle
with
a
wolf
it
took
place
when
he
was
a
young
man
before
he
was
a
soldier
putnam
lived
in
in
the
woods
there
were
still
a
few
wolves
one
old
wolf
came
to
every
winter
she
always
brought
a
family
of
young
wolves
with
her
the
hunters
would
always
kill
the
young
wolves
but
they
could
not
find
the
old
mother
wolf
she
knew
how
to
keep
out
of
the
way
the
farmers
tried
to
catch
her
in
their
traps
but
she
was
too
cunning
she
had
had
one
good
lesson
when
she
was
young
she
had
put
the
toes
of
one
foot
into
a
steel
trap
the
trap
had
snipped
them
off
after
that
she
was
more
careful
one
winter
night
she
went
out
to
get
some
meat
she
came
to
flock
of
sheep
and
goats
she
killed
some
of
them
she
found
it
great
fun
there
were
no
dogs
about
the
poor
sheep
had
nobody
to
protect
them
so
the
old
wolf
kept
on
killing
one
sheep
was
enough
for
her
supper
but
she
killed
the
rest
just
for
sport
she
killed
seventy
sheep
and
goats
that
night
putnam
and
his
friends
set
out
to
find
the
old
sheep
killer
there
were
six
men
of
them
they
agreed
that
two
of
them
should
hunt
for
her
at
a
time
then
another
two
should
begin
as
soon
as
the
first
two
should
stop
so
she
would
be
hunted
day
and
night
the
hunters
found
her
track
in
the
snow
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
it
the
track
made
by
one
of
her
feet
was
shorter
than
those
made
by
the
other
feet
that
was
because
one
of
her
feet
had
been
caught
in
a
trap
the
hunters
found
that
the
old
wolf
had
gone
a
long
way
off
perhaps
she
felt
guilty
she
must
have
thought
that
she
would
be
hunted
she
had
trotted
away
for
a
whole
night
then
she
turned
and
went
back
again
she
was
getting
hungry
by
this
time
she
wanted
some
more
sheep
the
men
followed
her
tracks
back
again
the
dogs
drove
her
into
a
hole
it
was
not
far
from
house
all
the
farmers
came
to
help
catch
her
they
sent
the
dogs
into
the
cave
where
the
wolf
was
but
the
wolf
bit
the
dogs
and
drove
them
out
again
then
the
men
put
a
pile
of
straw
in
the
mouth
of
the
cave
they
set
the
straw
on
fire
it
filled
the
cave
with
smoke
but
wolf
did
not
come
out
then
they
burned
in
the
cave
it
must
have
made
the
wolf
sneeze
but
the
cave
was
deep
she
went
as
far
in
as
she
could
and
staid
there
she
thought
that
the
smell
of
brimstone
was
not
so
bad
as
the
dogs
and
men
who
wanted
to
kill
her
putnam
wanted
to
send
his
negro
into
the
cave
to
drive
out
the
wolf
but
the
negro
thought
that
he
would
rather
stay
out
then
putnam
said
that
he
would
go
in
himself
he
tied
a
rope
to
his
legs
then
he
got
some
pieces
of
he
set
fire
to
these
he
knew
that
wild
animals
do
not
like
to
face
a
fire
he
got
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
he
held
the
blazing
bark
in
his
hand
he
crawled
through
the
small
hole
into
the
cave
there
was
not
room
for
him
to
stand
up
at
first
the
cave
went
downward
into
the
ground
then
it
was
level
a
little
way
then
it
went
upward
at
the
very
back
of
this
part
of
the
cave
was
the
wolf
putnam
crawled
up
until
he
could
see
the
eyes
when
the
wolf
saw
the
fire
she
gave
a
sudden
growl
putnam
jerked
the
rope
that
was
tied
to
his
leg
the
men
outside
thought
that
the
wolf
had
caught
him
they
pulled
on
the
other
end
of
the
rope
the
men
pulled
as
fast
as
they
could
when
they
had
drawn
putnam
out
his
clothes
were
torn
he
was
badly
scratched
by
the
rocks
he
now
got
his
gun
he
held
it
in
one
hand
he
held
the
burning
in
the
other
he
crawled
into
the
cave
again
when
the
wolf
saw
him
coming
again
she
was
very
angry
she
snapped
her
teeth
she
got
ready
to
spring
on
him
she
meant
to
kill
him
as
she
had
killed
his
sheep
putnam
fired
at
her
head
as
soon
as
his
gun
went
off
he
jerked
the
rope
his
friends
pulled
him
out
he
waited
awhile
for
the
smoke
of
his
gun
to
clear
up
then
he
went
in
once
more
he
wanted
to
see
if
the
wolf
was
dead
he
found
her
lying
down
he
tapped
her
nose
with
his
she
did
not
move
he
took
hold
of
her
then
he
jerked
the
rope
this
time
the
men
saw
him
come
out
bringing
the
dead
wolf
now
the
sheep
would
have
some
peace

school
johnny
had
to
speak
a
piece
that
had
to
do
with
trees
he
thought
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
say
about
the
little
cherry
tree
that
washington
spoiled
with
his
when
he
was
a
little
boy

is
what
he
said

had
a
a
bright
and
new
and
sharp
enough
to

hacked
and
whacked

whacked
and
hacked

hacked
a
log

hacked
a

as
round
about
he
ran
he
hacked
his
tree
and
made
an
spot
the
bark
was
soft

sharp

little
george
forgot
you
know

rest
the
father
frowned
and
asked
the
why
you
know
the
good
old
story
runs
he
could
not
tell
a
lie
the
boy
that
chopped
that
tree
soon
grew
to
be
a
youth
at
work
and
books
he
hacked
away
and
still
he
told
the
truth
the
youth
became
a
man
above
six
feet
in
height
and
when
he
had
good
work
to
do
he
hacked
with
all
his
might
he
fought

that
the

had
sent
across
the
sea
he
up
and
down
the

benny
west
learned
to
be
a
painter

times
there
lived
in
a
little
fellow
whose
name
was
west
he
lived
in
a
long
stone
house
illustration
painting
portrait
he
had
never
seen
a
picture
the
country
was
new
and
there
were
not
many
pictures
in
it
father
was
a
friend
or
quaker
the
friends
of
that
day
did
not
think
that
pictures
were
useful
things
to
make
or
to
have
before
he
was
seven
years
old
this
little
boy
began
to
draw
pictures
one
day
he
was
watching
the
cradle
of
his
child
the
baby
smiled
benny
was
so
pleased
with
her
beauty
that
he
made
a
picture
of
her
in
red
and
black
ink
the
picture
of
the
baby
pleased
his
mother
when
she
saw
it
that
was
very
pleasant
to
the
boy
he
made
other
pictures
at
school
he
used
to
draw
with
a
pen
before
he
could
write
he
made
pictures
of
birds
and
of
animals
sometimes
he
would
draw
flowers
illustration
flower
and
fruit
of
the
he
liked
to
draw
so
well
that
sometimes
he
forgot
to
do
his
work
his
father
sent
him
to
work
in
the
field
one
day
the
father
went
out
to
see
how
well
he
was
doing
his
work
benny
was
to
be
found
at
last
his
father
saw
him
sitting
under
a
large
he
was
making
pictures
he
had
squeezed
the
juice
out
of
some
the
juice
of
is
deep
red
with
this
the
boy
had
made
his
pictures
when
the
father
looked
at
them
he
was
surprised
there
were
portraits
of
every
member
of
the
family
his
father
knew
every
picture
up
to
this
time
benny
had
no
paints
nor
any
brushes
the
indians
had
not
all
gone
away
from
that
the
indians
paint
their
faces
with
red
and
yellow
colors
these
colors
they
make
sometimes
they
prepare
them
from
the
juice
of
some
plant
sometimes
they
get
them
by
finding
red
or
yellow
earth
some
of
the
indians
can
make
rough
pictures
with
these
colors
the
indians
near
the
house
of
father
must
have
liked
the
boy
they
showed
him
how
to
make
red
and
yellow
colors
for
himself
he
got
some
of
his
indigo
to
make
blue
he
now
had
red
yellow
and
blue
by
mixing
these
three
the
other
colors
that
he
wanted
could
be
made
but
he
had
no
brush
to
paint
with
he
took
some
long
hairs
from
the
tail
of
these
he
made
his
brushes
he
used
so
many
of
the
hairs
that
her
tail
began
to
look
bare
everybody
in
the
house
began
to
wonder
what
was
the
matter
with
tail
at
last
benny
told
where
he
got
his
brushes

a

of
came
from
the
city
on
a
visit
he
saw
some
of
the
drawings
when
he
went
home
he
sent
benny
a
box
of
paints
with
the
paints
were
some
brushes
and
there
was
some
canvas
such
as
pictures
are
painted
on
and
that
was
not
all
there
were
in
the
box
six
beautiful
the
little
painter
now
felt
himself
rich
he
was
so
happy
that
he
could
hardly
sleep
at
all
at
night
he
put
the
box
that
held
his
treasures
on
a
chair
by
his
bed
as
soon
as
daylight
came
he
carried
the
precious
box
to
the
garret
the
garret
of
the
long
stone
house
was
his
here
he
worked
away
all
day
long
he
did
not
go
to
school
at
all
perhaps
he
forgot
that
there
was
any
school
perhaps
the
little
artist
could
not
tear
himself
away
from
his
work
but
the
schoolmaster
missed
him
he
came
to
ask
if
benny
was
ill
the
mother
was
vexed
when
she
found
that
he
had
staid
away
from
school
she
went
to
look
for
the
naughty
boy
after
a
while
she
found
the
little
truant
he
was
hard
at
work
in
his
garret
she
saw
what
he
had
been
doing
he
had
not
copied
any
of
his
new
he
had
made
up
a
new
picture
by
taking
one
person
out
of
one
and
another
out
of
another
he
had
copied
these
so
that
they
made
a
picture
that
he
had
thought
of
for
himself
his
mother
could
not
find
it
in
her
heart
to
punish
him
she
was
too
much
pleased
with
the
picture
he
was
making
this
picture
was
not
finished
but
his
mother
would
not
let
him
finish
it
she
was
afraid
he
would
spoil
it
if
he
did
anything
more
on
it
the
good
people
called
friends
did
not
like
the
making
of
pictures
as
i
said
but
they
thought
that
benny
west
had
a
talent
that
he
ought
to
use
so
he
went
to
to
study
his
art
after
a
while
he
sailed
away
to
to
see
the
pictures
that
great
artists
had
painted

morning
when

the
hessians
were
sleeping
soundly

american
drums
waked
them
they
jumped
out
of
their
beds
they
ran
into
the
streets

tried
to
fight
the
americans

it
was

had
already
taken
their
cannons
his
men
were
firing
these
at
the
hessians
the
hessians
ran
into

washington
went
back
across
the
delaware
river
he
had
not
men
enough
to
fight
the
whole
british
army
but
the
americans
were
glad
when
they
heard
that
he
had
beaten
the
hessians
they
sent
him
more
soldiers
then
he
went
back
across
the
river
to
trenton
again
there
was
a
british
general
named
he
marched
to
trenton
he
fought
against
washington
had
more
men
than
washington
had
night
came
and
they
could
not
see
to
fight
there
was
a
little
creek
between
the
two
armies
washington
had
not
boats
enough
to
carry
his
men
across
the
river
was
sure
to
beat
him
if
they
should
fight
a
battle
the
next
morning

catch
the
fox

he

sent
for
some
more
soldiers
to
come
from
in
the
morning
he
wanted
them
to
help
him
catch
the
fox
but
foxes
sometimes
get
out
of
traps
when
it
was
dark
washington
had
all
his
camp
fires
lighted
he
put
men
to
digging
where
the
british
could
hear
them
he
made
cornwallis
think
that
he
was
throwing
up
banks
of
earth
and
getting
ready
to
fight
in
the
morning
but
washington
did
not
stay
in
trenton
he
did
not
wish
to
be
caught
like
a
fox
in
a
trap
he
could
not
get
across
the
river
but
he
knew
a
road
that
went
round
the
place
where
cornwallis
and
his
army
were
he
took
that
road
and
got
behind
the
british
army
it
was
just
like

waiting
to
catch
james

gone
round
behind
him
and
got
away
washington
went
out
of
trenton
in
the
darkness
you
might
say
that
he
marched
out
by
the
back
door
he
left
cornwallis
watching
the
front
door
the
americans
went
away
quietly
they
left
a
few
men
to
keep
up
the
fires
and
make
a
noise
like
digging
before
morning
these
slipped
away
too
when
morning
came
cornwallis
went
to
catch
his
fox
but
the
fox
was
not
there
he
looked
for
the
americans

was
the
place
where
they
had
been
digging
their
camp
fires
were
still
burning
but
where
had
they
gone
cornwallis
thought
that
washington
had
crossed
the
river
by
some
means
but
soon
he
heard
guns
firing
away
back
toward
princeton
he
thought
that
it
must
be
thunder
but
he
found
that
it
was
a
battle

gone
to

a
hard
fight
with

beat
them

cornwallis
knew
that
the
americans
had
gone
to

hurried
there
to
help
his
men

bought
hay
for
his
horses
he
had
roads
built
to
draw
his
cannons
on
he
knew
that
the
british
in
new
york
would
hear
about
what
he
was
doing
he
wanted
them
to
think
that
he
meant
to
come
to
new
york
and
fight
them
when
the
british
heard
what
the
americans
were
doing
they
got
ready
for
the
coming
of
washington
and
the
french
all
at
once
they
found
that
washington
had
gone
he
and
his
men
had
marched
away
the
french
soldiers
that
had
come
to
help
him
had
gone
with
him
nobody
knew
what
it
meant
own
men
did
not
know
where
they
were
going
they
went
from
new
jersey
into
then
they
marched
across
then
they
went
into
they
marched
across
that
state
and
then
they
went
into
by
this
time
everybody
could
tell
where
washington
was
going
people
could
see
that
he
was
going
straight
to
they
knew
that
washington
was
going
to
fight
his
old
enemy
at
but
he
had
kept
his
secret
long
enough
the
british
in
new
york
could
not
send
help
to
cornwallis
it
was
too
late
the
french
ships
sailed
to
and
shut
up
yorktown
on
the
side
of
the
sea
men
shut
it
up
on
the
side
of
the
land
they
built
great
banks
of
earth
round
it
on
these
banks
of
earth
they
put
cannons
the
british
could
not
get
away
they
fought
bravely
but
the
americans
and
french
came
closer
and
closer
then
the
british
tried
to
fight
their
way
out
but
they
were
driven
back
then
cornwallis
tried
to
get
his
men
across
the
river
he
wanted
to
get
out
by
the
back
door
as
washington
had
done
but
the
americans
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
drove
them
back
again
washington
had
now
caught
cornwallis
in
a
trap
the
americans
fired
cannon
balls
into
yorktown
these
set
the
houses
on
fire
at
last
cornwallis
had
to
give
up
the
british
marched
out
and
laid
down
their
guns
and
swords
the
british
army
in
new
york
could
not
fight
the
americans
by
itself
so
the
british
gave
it
up
then
there
was
peace
after
the
long
war
the
british
pulled
down
the
british
flag
and
sailed
away
the
country
was
free
at
last
tower
general
was
one
of
the
best
fighters
in
the
revolution
he
was
a
homely
little
man
he
was
also
a
very
good
man
another
general
said
is
good
all
the
american
army
had
been
beaten
in
south
was
sent
there
to
keep
the
british
from
taking
the
whole
country
marion
got
a
little
army
his
men
had
nothing
but
rough
clothes
to
wear
they
had
no
guns
but
the
old
ones
they
had
used
to
shoot
wild
ducks
and
deer
with
men
wanted
swords
there
were
no
swords
to
be
had
but
marion
sent
men
to
take
the
long
saws
out
of
the
saw
mills
these
were
taken
to
the
cut
the
saws
into
pieces
these
pieces
they
hammered
out
into
long
sharp
swords
marion
had
not
so
many
men
as
the
british
he
had
no
cannon
he
could
not
build
forts
he
could
not
stay
long
in
one
place
for
fear
the
british
should
come
with
a
strong
army
and
take
him
he
and
his
men
hid
in
the
dark
woods
sometimes
he
changed
his
hiding
place
suddenly
even
his
own
friends
had
hard
work
to
find
him
from
the
dark
woods
he
would
come
out
suddenly
he
would
attack
some
party
of
british
soldiers
when
the
battle
was
over
he
would
go
back
to
the
woods
again
when
the
british
sent
a
strong
army
to
catch
him
he
could
not
be
found
but
soon
he
would
be
fighting
the
british
in
some
new
place
he
was
always
playing
hide
and
seek
the
british
called
him
the
swamp
fox
that
was
because
he
was
so
hard
to
catch
they
could
not
conquer
the
country
until
they
could
catch
marion
and
they
never
could
catch
the
swamp
fox
at
one
time
marion
came
out
of
the
woods
to
take
a
little
british
fort
this
fort
was
on
the
top
of
a
high
mound
it
was
one
of
the
mounds
built
a
long
time
ago
by
the
indians
marion
put
his
men
all
round
the
fort
so
that
the
men
in
the
fort
could
not
get
out
to
get
water
he
thought
that
they
would
have
to
give
up
but
the
men
in
the
fort
dug
a
well
inside
the
fort
then
marion
had
to
think
of
another
plan
men
went
to
the
woods
and
cut
down
stout
poles
they
got
a
great
many
poles
when
night
came
they
laid
a
row
of
poles
one
another
on
the
ground
then
they
laid
another
row
across
these
then
they
laid
another
row
on
top
of
the
last
ones
and
across
the
other
way
again
illustration
tower
they
laid
a
great
many
rows
of
poles
one
on
top
of
another
they
crossed
them
this
way
and
that
as
the
night
went
on
the
pile
grew
higher
still
they
handed
poles
to
top
of
the
pile
before
morning
came
they
had
built
a
kind
of
tower
it
was
higher
than
the
indian
mound
as
soon
as
it
was
light
the
men
on
tower
began
to
shoot
the
british
looked
out
they
saw
a
great
tower
with
men
on
it
the
men
could
shoot
down
into
the
fort
the
british
could
not
stand
it
they
had
to
give
up
they
were
taken
prisoners
clark
and
his
men
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
there
were
but
few
people
living
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
but
there
were
many
indians
there
these
indians
killed
a
great
many
white
people
in
the
indians
were
sent
by
british
officers
to
do
this
killing
there
was
a
british
fort
at
vincennes
in
what
is
now
there
was
another
british
fort
or
post
at
in
what
is
now
the
state
of
george
rogers
clark
was
an
american
colonel
he
wanted
to
stop
the
murder
of
the
settlers
by
the
indians
he
thought
that
he
could
do
it
by
taking
the
british
posts
he
had
three
hundred
men
they
went
down
the
river
in
boats
they
landed
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
then
they
marched
a
hundred
and
thirty
miles
to
was
far
away
from
the
americans
the
people
there
did
not
think
that
the
americans
would
come
so
far
to
attack
them
when
clark
got
there
they
were
all
asleep
he
marched
in
and
took
the
town
before
they
waked
up
the
people
living
in
kaskaskia
were
french
by
treating
them
well
clark
made
them
all
friendly
to
the
americans
when
the
british
at
heard
that
clark
had
taken
kaskaskia
they
thought
that
they
would
take
it
back
again
but
it
was
winter
all
the
streams
were
full
of
water
they
could
not
march
till
spring
then
they
would
gather
the
indians
to
help
them
and
take
clark
and
his
men
but
clark
thought
that
he
would
not
wait
to
be
taken
he
thought
that
he
would
just
go
and
take
the
british
if
he
could
manage
to
get
to
in
the
winter
he
would
not
be
expected
clark
started
with
a
hundred
and
seventy
men
the
country
was
nearly
all
covered
with
water
the
men
were
in
the
wet
almost
all
the
time
clark
had
hard
work
to
keep
his
men
cheerful
he
did
everything
he
could
to
amuse
them
they
had
to
wade
through
deep
rivers
the
water
was
icy
cold
but
clark
made
a
joke
of
it
he
kept
them
laughing
whenever
he
could
at
one
place
the
men
refused
to
go
through
the
freezing
water
clark
could
not
them
to
cross
the
river
he
called
to
him
a
tall
he
was
the
very
tallest
man
in
little
army
clark
said
to
him
the
little
drummer
boy
on
your
the
little
drummer
was
soon
seated
high
on
the
shoulders
of
the
tall
man
go
ahead
said
clark
the
soldier
marched
into
the
water
the
little
drummer
beat
a
march
on
his
drum
clark
cried
out
then
he
plunged
into
the
water
after
the
tall
soldier
all
the
men
went
in
after
him
they
were
soon
safe
on
the
other
side
illustration
at
another
river
the
little
drummer
was
floated
over
on
the
top
of
his
drum
at
last
the
men
drew
near
to
they
could
hear
the
morning
and
evening
gun
in
the
british
fort
but
the
worst
of
the
way
was
yet
to
pass
the
river
had
risen
over
its
banks
the
water
was
five
miles
wide
the
men
marched
from
one
high
ground
to
another
through
the
cold
water
they
caught
an
indian
with
a
canoe
in
this
they
got
across
the
main
river
but
there
was
more
water
to
cross
the
men
were
so
hungry
that
some
of
them
fell
down
in
the
water
they
had
to
be
carried
out
men
got
frightened
at
last
and
then
they
had
no
heart
to
go
any
farther
but
clark
remembered
what
the
indians
did
when
they
went
to
war
he
took
a
little
in
his
hand
he
poured
water
on
it
then
he
rubbed
it
on
his
face
it
made
his
face
black
with
his
face
blackened
like
an
he
gave
an
indian
the
men
followed
him
again
the
men
were
tired
and
hungry
but
they
soon
reached
dry
ground
they
were
now
in
sight
of
the
fort
clark
marched
his
little
army
round
and
round
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
it
seem
that
he
had
many
men
with
him
he
wrote
a
fierce
letter
to
the
british
he
behaved
like
a
general
with
a
large
army
after
some
fighting
the
british
gave
up
little
army
took
the
british
fort
this
brave
action
saved
to
our
country
the
land
that
lies
between
the
ohio
river
and
the
lakes
it
stopped
the
sending
of
indians
to
kill
the
settlers
in
the
west
daniel
boone
and
his
grapevine
swing
daniel
boone
was
the
first
settler
of
he
knew
all
about
living
in
the
woods
he
knew
how
to
hunt
the
wild
animals
he
knew
how
to
fight
indians
and
how
to
get
away
from
them
nearly
all
the
men
that
came
with
him
to
kentucky
the
first
time
were
killed
one
was
eaten
by
wolves
some
of
them
were
killed
by
indians
some
of
them
went
into
the
woods
and
never
came
back
nobody
knows
what
killed
them
only
boone
and
his
brother
were
left
alive
they
needed
some
powder
and
some
bullets
they
wanted
some
horses
brother
went
back
across
the
mountains
to
get
these
things
boone
staid
in
his
little
cabin
all
alone
boone
could
hear
the
wolves
howl
near
his
cabin
at
night
he
heard
the
panthers
scream
in
the
woods
but
he
did
not
mind
being
left
all
alone
in
these
dark
forests
the
indians
came
to
his
cabin
when
he
was
away
he
did
not
want
to
see
these
he
did
not
dare
to
sleep
in
his
cabin
all
the
time
sometimes
he
slept
under
a
rocky
cliff
sometimes
he
slept
in
a
a
is
a
large
patch
of
growing
canes
such
as
fishing
rods
are
made
of
once
a
mother
bear
tried
to
kill
him
he
fired
his
gun
at
her
but
the
bullet
did
not
kill
her
the
bear
ran
at
him
he
held
his
long
knife
out
in
his
hand
the
bear
ran
against
it
and
was
killed
he
made
long
journeys
alone
in
the
woods
one
day
he
looked
back
through
the
trees
and
saw
four
indians
they
were
tracks
they
did
not
see
him
he
turned
this
way
and
that
but
the
indians
still
his
tracks
he
went
over
a
little
hill
here
he
found
a
wild
it
was
a
very
long
vine
reaching
to
the
top
of
a
high
tree
there
are
many
such
vines
in
the
southern
woods
children
cut
such
vines
off
near
the
roots
then
they
use
them
for
swings
boone
had
swung
on
when
he
was
a
boy
he
now
thought
of
a
way
to
break
his
tracks
he
cut
the
wild
off
near
the
root
then
he
took
hold
of
it
he
sprang
out
into
the
air
with
all
his
might
the
great
swing
carried
him
far
out
as
it
swung
then
he
let
go
he
fell
to
the
ground
and
then
he
ran
away
in
a
from
that
in
which
he
had
been
going
when
the
indians
came
to
the
place
they
could
not
find
his
tracks
they
could
not
tell
which
way
he
had
gone
he
got
to
his
cabin
in
safety
boone
had
now
been
alone
for
many
months
his
brother
did
not
get
back
at
the
time
he
had
set
for
coming
boone
thought
that
his
brother
might
have
been
killed
boone
had
not
tasted
anything
but
meat
since
he
left
home
he
had
to
get
his
food
by
shooting
animals
in
the
woods
by
this
time
he
had
hardly
any
powder
or
bullets
left
illustration
boone
on
the
grapevine
swing
one
evening
he
sat
by
his
cabin
he
heard
some
one
coming
he
thought
that
it
might
be
indians
he
heard
the
steps
of
horses
he
looked
through
the
trees
he
saw
his
brother
riding
on
one
horse
and
leading
another
the
other
horse
was
loaded
with
powder
and
bullets
and
clothes
and
other
things
that
boone
needed
daniel
daughter
and
her
friends
daniel
boone
and
his
brother
picked
out
a
good
place
in
to
settle
then
they
went
home
to
north
they
took
with
them
such
things
as
were
and
these
were
the
skins
of
animals
they
had
killed
and
no
doubt
some
of
the
heads
and
tails
boone
was
restless
he
had
seen
kentucky
and
he
did
not
wish
to
settle
down
to
the
life
of
north
carolina
in
two
years
boone
sold
his
farm
in
north
carolina
and
set
out
for
kentucky
he
took
with
him
his
wife
and
children
and
two
brothers
some
of
their
neighbors
went
with
them
they
by
pack
train
all
their
goods
were
packed
on
horses
when
they
reached
the
place
on
the
kentucky
river
that
boone
had
chosen
for
a
home
they
built
a
fort
of
log
houses
these
cabins
all
stood
round
a
square
the
backs
of
the
houses
were
outward
there
was
no
door
or
window
in
the
back
of
a
house
the
outer
walls
were
thus
shut
up
they
made
the
place
a
fort
the
houses
at
the
four
corners
were
a
little
taller
and
stronger
than
the
others
there
were
gates
leading
into
the
fort
these
gates
were
kept
shut
at
night
in
the
evening
the
people
danced
and
amused
themselves
in
the
square
indians
could
not
creep
up
and
attack
them
when
the
men
went
out
to
feed
the
horses
and
cows
they
carried
their
guns
they
walked
softly
and
turned
their
eyes
quickly
from
point
to
point
to
see
if
indians
were
hiding
near
they
held
their
guns
so
they
could
shoot
quickly
the
women
and
children
had
to
stay
very
near
the
fort
so
they
could
run
in
if
an
indian
came
in
sight
daniel
boone
had
a
daughter
named
she
was
about
fourteen
years
old
she
had
two
friends
named
frances
and
betsey
frances
galloway
was
about
the
same
age
as
jemima
one
summer
afternoon
these
three
girls
went
out
of
the
fort
they
went
to
the
river
and
got
into
a
canoe
it
was
not
far
from
the
fort
they
felt
safe
they
laughed
and
talked
and
splashed
the
water
with
their
paddles
the
carried
them
slowly
near
the
other
shore
they
could
still
see
the
fort
they
did
not
think
of
danger
trees
and
bushes
grew
thick
down
to
the
edge
of
the
river
five
strong
indians
were
hiding
in
the
bushes
one
indian
crept
through
the
bushes
he
made
no
more
noise
than
a
snake
when
he
got
to
the
edge
of
the
water
he
put
out
his
long
arm
and
caught
hold
of
the
rope
that
hung
down
from
the
canoe
in
a
moment
he
had
turned
the
boat
around
and
drawn
it
out
of
sight
from
the
fort
the
girls
screamed
when
they
saw
the
indian
their
friends
heard
them
but
could
not
cross
the
river
to
help
them
the
girls
had
taken
the
only
canoe
boone
and
were
both
gone
from
the
fort
they
got
home
too
late
to
start
that
day
no
sleep
came
to
their
eyes
while
they
waited
for
light
to
travel
by
as
soon
as
there
was
a
of
light
they
and
a
party
of
their
friends
set
out
it
was
in
july
and
they
could
start
early
they
crossed
the
river
and
easily
found
the
tracks
where
they
started
the
brush
was
broken
down
there
the
indians
were
they
did
not
keep
close
together
after
they
set
out
each
indian
walked
by
himself
through
the
tall
canes
three
of
the
indians
took
the
captives
boone
and
his
friends
tried
in
vain
to
follow
them
sometimes
they
would
find
a
track
but
it
would
soon
be
lost
in
the
thick
canes
party
gave
up
trying
to
find
their
path
they
noticed
which
way
the
indians
were
going
then
they
walked
as
fast
as
they
could
the
same
way
for
thirty
miles
they
thought
the
indians
would
grow
careless
about
their
tracks
after
traveling
so
far
they
turned
so
as
to
cross
the
path
they
thought
the
indians
had
taken
they
looked
carefully
at
the
ground
and
at
the
bushes
to
see
if
any
one
had
gone
by
before
long
they
found
the
tracks
in
a
buffalo
path
buffaloes
and
other
animals
go
often
to
lick
salt
from
the
rocks
round
salt
springs
they
beat
down
the
brush
and
make
great
roads
these
roads
run
to
the
salt
springs
the
hunters
call
them
streets
the
indians
took
one
of
these
roads
after
they
got
far
from
the
fort
they
could
travel
more
easily
in
it
they
did
not
take
pains
to
hide
their
tracks
as
fast
as
their
feet
could
carry
them
boone
and
his
friends
traveled
along
the
trail
when
they
had
gone
about
ten
miles
they
saw
the
indians
the
indians
had
stopped
to
rest
and
to
eat
it
was
very
warm
and
they
had
put
off
their
and
laid
down
their
arms
they
were
kindling
a
fire
to
cook
by
in
a
moment
the
indians
saw
the
white
men
boone
and
galloway
were
afraid
the
indians
would
kill
the
girls
four
of
the
white
men
shot
at
the
indians
then
all
rushed
at
them
the
indians
ran
away
as
fast
as
they
could
they
did
not
stop
to
pick
up
their
guns
or
knives
or
hatchets
they
had
no
time
to
put
on
their
moccasins
the
poor
girls
were
soon
safe
in
their
arms
back
to
they
went
not
minding
their
tired
feet
when
they
got
to
the
fort
there
was
great
joy
to
see
them
alive
i
do
not
believe
they
ever
played
in
the
water
again
decatur
and
the
pirates
nearly
a
hundred
years
have
passed
since
the
ship
was
burned
but
the
brave
sailors
who
did
it
will
never
be
the
people
of
in
were
pirates
they
took
the
ships
of
other
nations
at
sea
they
made
slaves
of
their
prisoners
the
friends
of
these
slaves
sometimes
sent
money
to
buy
their
freedom
some
countries
paid
money
to
these
pirates
to
let
their
ships
go
safe
our
country
had
trouble
with
the
pirates
this
trouble
brought
on
a
war
our
ships
were
sent
to
fight
against
one
of
the
ships
fighting
against
the
pirates
was
called
the
one
day
she
was
chasing
a
ship
of
the
ran
on
the
rocks
the
sailors
could
not
get
her
off
the
pirates
came
and
fought
her
as
she
lay
on
the
rocks
they
took
her
men
prisoners
then
they
went
to
work
to
get
her
off
after
a
long
time
they
got
her
into
deep
water
they
took
her
to
tripoli
our
ships
could
not
go
there
after
her
because
there
were
so
many
great
cannons
on
the
shore
near
the
ship
the
pirates
got
the
ready
to
go
to
sea
they
loaded
her
cannons
they
meant
to
slip
out
past
our
ships
of
war
then
they
would
take
a
great
many
smaller
american
ships
but
the
americans
laid
a
plan
to
burn
the
it
was
a
very
thing
to
try
to
do
the
pirates
had
ships
of
war
near
the
they
had
great
guns
on
the
shore
there
was
no
way
to
do
it
in
the
it
could
only
be
done
by
stealing
into
the
bay
of
tripoli
at
night
the
americans
had
taken
a
little
vessel
from
the
pirates
she
was
of
the
kind
that
is
called
a
ketch
she
had
sails
she
also
had
long
oars
when
there
was
no
wind
to
sail
with
the
sailors
could
row
her
with
the
oars
this
little
ketch
was
sent
one
night
to
burn
the
the
captain
of
this
boat
was
he
was
a
young
man
and
very
brave
made
his
men
lie
down
so
that
the
pirates
would
not
know
how
many
men
he
had
on
his
ketch
only
about
ten
men
were
in
sight
the
rest
were
lying
hidden
on
the
boat
they
came
near
to
the
it
was
about
ten
at
night
the
pirates
called
to
them
the
pilot
of
the
ketch
told
them
that
he
was
from
he
told
them
that
he
had
come
to
sell
things
to
the
people
of
tripoli
he
said
that
the
ketch
had
lost
her
anchor
he
asked
them
to
let
him
tie
her
to
the
big
ship
till
morning
the
pirates
sent
out
a
rope
to
them
but
when
the
ketch
came
nearer
the
pirates
saw
that
they
had
been
fooled
they
cried
out
americans
then
the
americans
lying
down
took
hold
of
the
rope
and
pulled
with
all
their
might
and
drew
the
ketch
close
to
the
ship
they
were
so
close
that
the
cannons
were
over
their
heads
the
pirates
could
not
fire
at
them
the
men
who
had
been
lying
still
now
rose
up
there
were
eighty
of
them
in
a
minute
they
were
up
the
sides
of
the
big
ship
some
went
in
one
way
some
another
they
did
not
shoot
they
fought
with
swords
and
pikes
or
short
spears
soon
they
drove
the
pirates
to
one
side
of
the
ship
then
they
could
hear
the
pirates
jumping
over
into
the
water
in
a
few
minutes
the
pirates
had
all
gone
but
the
americans
could
not
stay
long
they
must
burn
the
ship
before
the
pirates
on
the
shore
should
find
out
what
they
were
doing
they
had
brought
a
lot
of
on
the
ketch
they
built
fires
in
all
parts
of
the
ship
the
fire
ran
so
fast
that
some
of
the
men
had
trouble
to
get
off
the
ship
when
the
americans
got
back
on
the
ketch
they
could
not
untie
the
rope
that
held
the
ketch
to
the
ship
the
big
ship
was
bursting
into
flames
the
ketch
would
soon
take
fire
they
took
swords
and
hacked
the
big
rope
in
two
then
they
pushed
hard
to
get
away
from
the
fire
the
ketch
began
to
move
the
sailors
took
the
large
oars
and
rowed
they
were
soon
safe
from
the
fire
all
this
they
had
done
without
any
noise
but
now
that
they
had
got
away
they
looked
back
the
fire
was
shooting
up
toward
the
sky
the
men
stopped
rowing
and
they
gave
three
cheers
they
were
so
glad
that
they
could
not
help
it
by
this
time
the
pirates
on
shore
had
waked
up
they
began
to
fire
great
cannon
balls
at
the
little
ketch
one
of
the
balls
went
through
her
sails
ah
how
the
sailors
rowed
the
whole
sky
was
now
lighted
up
by
the
fire
the
cannons
were
thundering
the
cannon
balls
were
splashing
the
water
all
round
the
ketch
but
the
americans
got
away
at
last
they
were
safe
in
their
own
ships
stories
about
jefferson
thomas
was
one
of
the
great
men
of
the
revolution
he
was
not
a
soldier
he
was
not
a
great
speaker
but
he
was
a
great
thinker
and
he
was
a
great
writer
he
wrote
a
paper
that
was
the
very
beginning
of
the
united
states
it
was
a
paper
that
said
that
we
would
be
free
from
england
and
be
a
by
we
call
that
paper
the
of
when
he
was
a
boy
was
fond
of
boyish
plays
but
when
he
was
tired
of
play
he
took
up
a
book
it
pleased
him
to
learn
things
from
the
time
when
he
was
a
boy
he
never
sat
down
to
rest
without
a
book
at
school
he
learned
what
other
boys
did
but
the
between
him
and
most
other
boys
was
this
he
did
not
stop
with
knowing
just
what
the
other
boys
knew
most
boys
want
to
learn
what
other
boys
learn
most
girls
would
like
to
know
what
their
know
but
wanted
to
know
a
great
deal
more
as
a
young
man
jefferson
knew
latin
and
greek
he
also
knew
french
and
and
he
did
not
talk
to
show
off
what
he
knew
he
tried
to
learn
what
other
people
knew
when
he
talked
to
a
wagon
maker
he
asked
him
about
such
things
as
a
wagon
maker
knows
most
about
he
would
sometimes
ask
how
a
wagon
maker
would
go
to
work
to
make
a
wheel
when
jefferson
talked
to
a
man
he
asked
him
about
those
things
that
this
man
knew
most
about
when
he
talked
with
indians
he
got
them
to
tell
him
about
their
that
is
the
way
he
came
to
know
so
much
about
so
many
things
whenever
anybody
told
him
anything
worth
while
he
wrote
it
down
as
soon
as
he
could
one
day
jefferson
was
he
went
on
that
was
a
common
way
of
at
that
time
he
stopped
at
a
country
tavern
at
this
tavern
he
talked
with
a
stranger
who
was
staying
there
after
a
while
jefferson
rode
away
then
the
stranger
said
to
the
is
that
man
he
knew
so
much
about
law
that
i
was
sure
he
was
a
lawyer
but
when
we
talked
about
he
knew
so
much
about
that
that
i
thought
he
must
be
a
doctor
and
after
a
while
he
seemed
to
know
so
much
about
that
i
was
sure
he
was
a
who
is
he
the
stranger
was
very
much
surprised
to
hear
that
the
man
he
had
talked
with
was
thomas
jefferson
jefferson
was
a
very
polite
man
one
day
his
was
riding
with
him
they
met
a
negro
the
negro
lifted
his
cap
and
bowed
jefferson
bowed
to
the
negro
but
his
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
bow
then
jefferson
said
to
his
not
let
a
poor
negro
be
more
of
a
than
you
in
the
of
jefferson
wrote
these
words
men
are
created
he
also
said
that
the
poor
man
had
the
same
right
as
the
rich
man
to
live
and
to
be
free
and
to
try
to
make
himself
happy
a
long
journey
a
long
time
ago
when
thomas
jefferson
was
most
of
the
people
in
this
country
lived
in
the
east
nobody
knew
anything
about
the
far
west
the
only
people
that
lived
there
were
indians
many
of
these
indians
had
never
seen
a
white
man
illustration
an
elk
the
sent
men
to
travel
into
this
wild
part
of
the
country
he
told
them
to
go
up
to
the
upper
end
of
the
river
then
they
were
to
go
across
the
rocky
mountains
they
were
to
keep
on
till
they
got
to
the
then
they
were
to
come
back
again
they
were
to
find
out
the
best
way
to
get
through
the
mountains
and
they
were
to
find
out
what
kind
of
people
the
indians
in
that
country
were
they
were
also
to
tell
about
the
animals
there
were
two
captains
of
this
company
their
names
were
lewis
and
clark
there
were
men
in
the
party
they
were
gone
two
years
and
four
months
for
most
of
that
time
they
did
not
see
any
white
men
but
their
own
party
they
did
not
hear
a
word
from
home
for
more
than
two
years
they
got
their
food
mostly
by
hunting
they
killed
a
great
many
and
elks
and
deer
they
also
shot
wild
geese
and
other
large
birds
sometimes
they
had
nothing
but
fish
to
eat
sometimes
they
had
to
eat
wolves
when
they
had
no
other
meat
they
were
glad
to
buy
dogs
from
the
indians
and
eat
them
sometimes
they
ate
horses
they
became
fond
of
the
meat
of
dogs
and
horses
when
they
were
very
hungry
they
had
to
live
on
roots
if
they
could
get
them
some
of
the
indians
made
a
kind
of
bread
out
of
roots
the
white
men
bought
this
when
they
could
not
get
meat
but
there
were
days
when
they
did
not
have
anything
to
eat
they
were
very
friendly
with
the
indians
one
day
some
of
the
men
went
to
make
a
visit
to
an
indian
village
the
indians
gave
them
something
to
eat
in
the
indian
where
they
were
there
was
a
head
of
a
dead
buffalo
when
dinner
was
over
the
indians
filled
a
bowl
full
of
meat
they
set
this
down
in
front
of
the
head
then
they
said
to
the
head
illustration
feeding
the
spirit
of
the
buffalo
the
indians
believed
that
if
they
treated
this
buffalo
head
politely
the
live
buffaloes
would
come
to
their
hunting
ground
then
they
would
have
plenty
of
meat
they
think
the
spirit
of
the
buffalo
is
a
kind
of
a
god
they
are
very
careful
to
please
this
god
captain
burning
glass
the
indians
among
whom
captain
clark
and
captain
lewis
traveled
had
many
strange
ways
of
doing
things
they
had
nothing
like
our
matches
for
making
fire
one
tribe
of
indians
had
this
way
of
lighting
a
fire
an
indian
would
lay
down
a
dry
stick
he
would
rub
this
stick
with
the
end
of
another
stick
after
a
while
this
rubbing
would
make
something
like
on
the
stick
that
was
lying
down
the
indian
would
keep
on
rubbing
till
the
wood
grew
hot
then
the
fine
wood
dust
would
smoke
then
it
would
burn
the
indian
would
put
a
little
wood
on
it
soon
he
would
have
a
large
fire
in
that
time
the
white
people
had
not
yet
found
out
how
to
make
matches
they
lighted
a
fire
by
striking
a
piece
of
flint
against
a
piece
of
steel
this
would
make
a
spark
of
fire
by
letting
this
spark
fall
on
something
that
would
burn
easily
they
started
a
fire
white
men
had
another
way
of
lighting
a
fire
when
the
sun
was
shining
they
used
what
was
called
a
burning
glass
this
was
a
round
piece
of
glass
it
was
thick
in
the
middle
and
thin
at
the
edge
when
you
held
up
a
burning
glass
in
the
sun
it
drew
the
heat
so
as
to
make
a
little
hot
spot
if
you
put
paper
under
this
spot
of
hot
sunshine
it
would
burn
men
could
light
the
in
their
pipes
with
one
of
these
glasses
captain
clark
had
something
funny
happen
to
him
on
account
of
his
burning
glass
he
had
walked
ahead
of
the
rest
of
his
men
he
sat
down
on
a
rock
there
were
some
indians
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
they
did
not
see
the
captain
captain
clark
saw
a
large
bird
called
a
crane
flying
over
his
head
he
raised
his
gun
and
shot
it
illustration
cranes
the
indians
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
had
never
seen
a
white
man
in
their
lives
they
had
never
heard
a
gun
they
used
bows
and
arrows
they
heard
the
sound
of
gun
they
looked
up
and
saw
the
large
bird
falling
from
the
sky
it
fell
close
to
where
captain
clark
sat
just
as
it
fell
they
caught
sight
of
captain
clark
sitting
on
the
rocks
they
thought
they
had
seen
him
fall
out
of
the
sky
they
thought
that
the
sound
of
his
gun
was
a
sound
like
thunder
that
was
made
when
he
came
down
the
indians
all
ran
away
as
fast
as
they
could

pipe
for
the
indians
to
smoke
with
him
that

their
way
of
making
friends

none
of
the

would
touch
the

thought
that

had
brought
fire
down
from

to
light
his
pipe

were
now
sure
that

he
rapped
robert
on
the
knuckles
with
a
robert

more
than
any
other
boy

said
the
boy
came
here
to
have
something
beaten
into
my
head
not
into
my

that
day
people
used
to
light
candles
and
stand
them
in
the
window
on
the
fourth
of
july
these
candles
in
every
window
lighted
up
the
whole
town
but
one
year
candles
were
scarce
and
high
the
city
asked
the
people
not
to
light
up
their
windows
on
the
fourth
bob
did
not
like
to
miss
the
fun
of
his
fourth
of
july
he
went
to
work
to
make
something
like
rockets
or
roman
candles
it
was
a
very
business
for
a
boy
are
you
doing
bob
some
one
asked
him
city
does
not
want
us
to
burn

used
to
go
fishing
with
a
boy
named
chris

the
father
of
chris
went
with
them
they
fished
from
a
flat
boat
the
two
boys
had
to
push
the
boat
to
the
fishing
place
with
poles
am
tired
of
poling
that
boat
said
robert
to
chris
one
day
when
they
came
home
so
he
set
to
work
to
think
out
a
plan
to
move
the
boat
in
an
easier
way
than
by
poles
he
whittled
out
the
model
of
a
tiny
paddle
wheel
then
he
went
to
work
with
chris
gumpf
and
they
made
a
larger
paddle
wheel
this
they
set
up
in
the
fishing
boat
the
wheel
was
turned
by
the
boys
with
a
crank
they
did
not
use
the
poles
any
more

saw

they
laughed
they
said
that
such
a
boat
would
never
go
for
thousands
of
years
had
made
their
boats
go
by
using
sails
and
oars
people
had
never
seen
any
such
boat
as
this
it
seemed
foolish
to
believe
that
a
boat
could
be
pushed
along
by
steam
the
time
came
for
fulton
to
start
his
boat
a
crowd
of
people
were
standing
on
the
shore
the
black
smoke
was
coming
out
of
the
the
people
were
laughing
at
the
boat
they
were
sure
that
it
would
not
go
at
last
the
wheels
began
to
turn
round
then
the
boat
began
to
move
there
were
no
oars
there
were
no
sails
but
still
the
boat
kept
moving
faster
and
faster
she
went
all
the
people
now
saw
that
she
could
go
by
steam
they
did
not
laugh
any
more
they
began
to
cheer

seeing
the
first
steam

the
little
ran
up
to
the
people
who
lived
on
the
river
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
they
had
never
heard
of

they
could
not

made
the
boat
go

were
many
sailing
vessels

passed
some
of
these
in
the
night
the
sailors
were
afraid
when
they
saw
the
fire
and
smoke
the
sound
of
the
steam
seemed
dreadful
to
them
some
of
them
went
in
their
ships
for
fear
some
of
them
went
ashore
perhaps
they
thought
it
was
a
living
animal
that
would
eat
them
up

soon
there
were

author
he
wrote
a
life
of
washington
little
irving
was
a
merry
playful
boy
he
was
full
of
mischief
sometimes
he
would
climb
out
of
a
window
to
the
roof
of
his
house
from
this
he
would
go
to
roofs
of
other
houses
then
the
little
rascal
would
drop
a
pebble
down
a
chimney
then
he
would
hurry
back
and
get
into
the
window
again
he
would
wonder
what
the
people
thought
when
the
pebble
came
rattling
down
their
chimney
of
course
he
was
punished
when
his
tricks
were
found
out
but
he
was
a
favorite
with
his
teacher
with
all
his
faults
he
would
not
tell
a
lie
the
teacher
called
the
little
fellow

those
days
naughty

whipped
irving
could
not
bear
to
see
another
boy
suffer
when
a
boy
was
to
be
whipped
the
girls
were
sent
out
irving
always
asked
the
schoolmaster
to
let
him
go
out
with
the
girls
like
other
boys
irving
was
fond
of
stories
he
liked
to
read
about
the
sailor
and
but
most
of
all
he
liked
to
read
about
other
countries
he
had
twenty
small
volumes
called
world
they
told
about
the
people
and
countries
of
the
world
irving
read
these
little
books
a
great
deal
one
day
the
schoolmaster
caught
him
reading
in
school
the
master
slipped
behind
him
and
grabbed
the
book
then
he
told
irving
to
stay
after
school
irving
expected
a
but
the
master
told
him
he
was
pleased
to
find
that
he
liked
to
read
such
good
books
he
told
him
not
to
read
them
in
school
reading
about
other
countries
made
irving
wish
to
see
them
he
thought
he
would
like
to
travel
like
other
wild
boys
he
thought
of
running
away
he
wanted
to
go
to
sea
but
he
knew
that
sailors
had
to
eat
salt
pork
he
did
not
like
salt
pork
he
thought
he
would
learn
to
like
it
when
he
got
a
chance
he
ate
pork
and
sometimes
he
would
sleep
all
night
on
the
floor
he
wanted
to
get
used
to
a
hard
bed
but
the
more
he
ate
pork
the
more
he
disliked
it
and
the
more
he
slept
on
the
floor
the
more
he
liked
a
good
bed
so
he
gave
up
his
foolish
notion
of
being
a
sailor
boy

that
the
boy
liked
such
things
his
father
took
pains
to
get
birds
and
flowers
for
him
while
he
was
yet
a
boy
at
school
he
began
to
gather
birds
and
other
animals
for
himself
he
learned
to
skin
and
stuff
them
but
his
stuffed
birds
did
not
please
him
their
feathers
did
not
look
bright
like
those
of
live
birds
he
wanted
living
birds
to
study
his
father
told
him
that
he
could
not
keep
so
many
birds
alive
to
please
the
boy
he
got
him
a
book
with
pictures
in
it
looking
at
these
pictures
made
john
james
wish
to
draw
he
thought
that
he
could
make
pictures
that
would
look
like
the
live
birds
but
when
he
tried
to
paint
a
picture
of
a
bird
it
looked
worse
than
his
stuffed
birds
the
birds
he
drew
were
not
much
like
real
birds
he
called
them
a
of
as
often
as
his
birthday
came
round
he
made
a
of
his
bad
pictures
then
he
would
begin
over
again
all
this
time
he
was
learning
to
draw
birds
but
he
was
not
willing
to
make
pictures
that
were
not
just
like
the
real
birds
so
when
he
grew
to
be
a
man
he
went
to
a
great
french
painter
whose
name
was
david
david
taught
him
to
draw
and
paint
things
as
they
are
then
he
came
back
to
this
country
and
lived
awhile
in
pennsylvania
here
his
chief
study
was
the
wild
creatures
of
the
woods
he
gathered
many
eggs
of
birds
he
made
pictures
of
these
eggs
he
did
not
take
eggs
to
break
up
the
nests
he
was
not
cruel
he
took
only
what
he
needed
to
study
he
would
make
two
little
holes
in
each
egg
then
he
would
shake
the
egg
or
stir
it
up
with
a
little
stick
or
straw
or
a
long
pin
this
would
break
up
the
inside
of
the
egg
then
he
would
blow
into
one
of
the
holes
that
would
blow
the
inside
of
the
egg
out
through
the
other
hole
these
egg
shells
he
strung
together
by
running
strings
through
the
holes
he
hung
these
strings
of
egg
shells
all
over
the
walls
of
his
room
on
the
he
put
the
stuffed
skins
of
squirrels
raccoons
and
other
small
animals
on
the
shelves
his
friends
could
see
frogs
snakes
and
other
animals
he
married
a
young
lady
and
brought
her
to
live
in
this
with
his
dead
snakes
frogs
and
strings
of
eggs
she
liked
what
he
did
and
was
sure
that
he
would
come
to
be
a
great
man
he
made
up
his
mind
to
write
a
great
book
about
american
birds
he
meant
to
tell
all
about
the
birds
in
one
book
then
in
another
book
he
would
print
pictures
of
the
birds
just
as
large
as
the
birds
he
meant
to
have
them
look
just
like
the
birds
to
do
this
he
must
travel
many
thousands
of
miles
he
must
live
for
years
almost
all
of
the
time
in
the
woods
he
would
have
to
find
and
shoot
the
birds
in
order
to
make
pictures
of
them
and
he
must
see
how
the
birds
lived
and
how
they
built
their
nests
so
that
he
could
tell
all
about
them
it
would
take
a
great
deal
of
work
and
trouble
but
he
was
not
afraid
of
trouble
that
was
many
years
ago
much
of
our
country
was
then
covered
with
great
trees
sometimes
went
in
a
boat
down
a
river
sometimes
he
rode
on
often
he
had
to
travel
on
foot
through
woods
where
there
were
no
roads
many
a
time
he
had
to
sleep
out
of
doors
he
lost
his
money
and
became
poor
sometimes
he
had
to
paint
portraits
to
get
money
to
live
on
once
he
turned
dancing
master
for
a
while
but
he
did
not
give
up
his
great
idea
he
still
studied
birds
and
worked
to
make
his
books
about
american
birds
his
wife
went
to
teaching
to
help
make
a
living
after
years
of
hard
work
he
made
paintings
of
nearly
a
thousand
birds
that
was
almost
enough
for
his
books
but
while
he
was
traveling
two
large
rats
got
into
the
box
in
which
he
kept
his
pictures
they
cut
up
all
his
paintings
with
their
teeth
and
made
a
nest
of
the
pieces
this
almost
broke
his
heart
for
a
while
for
many
nights
he
could
not
sleep
because
he
had
lost
all
his
work
but
he
did
not
give
up
after
some
days
he
took
his
gun
and
went
into
the
woods
he
said
to
himself
will
begin
over
again
i
can
make
better
paintings
than
those
that
the
rats
but
it
took
him
four
long
years
and
a
half
to
find
the
birds
and
make
the
pictures
again
he
was
so
careful
to
have
his
drawings
just
like
the
birds
that
he
would
measure
them
in
every
way
thus
he
made
his
pictures
just
the
size
of
the
birds
themselves
at
last
the
great
books
were
printed
in
this
country
in
france
and
in
england
people
praised
the
books
they
knew
that
was
indeed
a
great
man
audubon
in
the
wild
woods
when
was
making
his
great
book
about
birds
he
had
to
live
much
in
the
woods
sometimes
he
lived
among
the
indians
he
once
saw
an
indian
go
into
a
hollow
tree
there
was
a
bear
in
the
tree
the
indian
had
a
knife
in
his
hand
he
fought
with
the
bear
in
the
tree
and
killed
it
could
shoot
very
well
a
friend
of
his
one
day
threw
up
his
cap
in
the
air
he
told
to
shoot
at
it
when
the
cap
came
down
it
had
a
hole
in
it
but
the
hunters
who
lived
in
the
woods
could
shoot
better
they
would
light
a
candle
then
one
of
the
hunters
would
take
his
gun
and
go
a
hundred
steps
away
from
the
candle
he
would
then
shoot
at
the
candle
he
would
shoot
so
as
to
snuff
it
he
would
not
put
out
the
candle
he
would
only
cut
off
a
bit
of
the
wick
with
the
bullet
but
he
would
leave
the
candle
burning
illustration
snuffing
the
candle
once
audubon
came
near
being
killed
by
some
robbers
he
stopped
at
a
cabin
where
lived
an
old
white
woman
he
found
a
young
indian
in
the
house
the
indian
had
hurt
himself
with
an
arrow
he
had
come
to
the
house
to
spend
the
night
the
old
woman
saw
fine
gold
watch
she
asked
him
to
let
her
look
at
it
he
put
it
into
her
hands
for
a
minute
then
the
indian
passed
by
audubon
and
pinched
him
two
or
three
times
that
was
to
let
him
know
that
the
woman
was
bad
and
that
she
might
rob
him
audubon
went
and
lay
down
with
his
hand
on
his
gun
after
a
while
two
men
came
in
they
were
the
sons
of
the
old
woman
then
the
old
woman
sharpened
a
large
knife
she
told
the
young
men
to
kill
the
indian
first
and
then
to
kill
audubon
and
take
his
watch
she
thought
that
audubon
was
asleep
but
he
drew
up
his
gun
ready
to
fire
just
then
two
hunters
came
to
the
cabin
audubon
told
them
what
the
robbers
were
going
to
do
they
took
the
old
woman
and
her
sons
and
tied
their
hands
and
feet
the
indian
though
he
was
in
pain
from
his
hurt
danced
for
joy
when
he
saw
that
the
robbers
were
caught
the
woman
and
her
sons
were
afterward
punished
hunting
a
panther
audubon
was
traveling
in
the
woods
in
he
found
the
little
cabin
of
a
settler
he
staid
there
for
the
night
the
settler
told
him
that
there
was
a
panther
in
the
swamp
near
his
house
a
panther
is
a
very
large
and
fierce
animal
it
is
large
enough
to
kill
a
man
this
was
a
very
bad
panther
it
had
killed
some
of
the
dogs
audubon
said
us
hunt
this
panther
and
kill
so
the
settler
sent
out
for
his
to
come
and
help
kill
the
panther
five
men
came
audubon
and
the
settler
made
seven
they
were
all
on
when
they
came
to
the
edge
of
the
swamp
each
man
went
a
way
they
each
took
their
dogs
with
them
to
find
the
track
of
the
wild
beast
all
of
the
hunters
carried
horns
should
find
the
track
first
was
to
blow
his
horn
to
let
the
others
know
in
about
two
hours
after
they
had
started
they
heard
the
sound
of
a
horn
it
told
them
that
the
track
had
been
found
every
man
now
went
toward
the
sound
of
the
horn
soon
all
the
yelping
dogs
were
the
track
of
the
fierce
panther
the
panther
was
running
into
the
swamp
farther
and
farther
i
suppose
that
the
panther
thought
that
there
were
too
many
dogs
and
men
for
him
to
fight
all
the
hunters
came
after
the
dogs
they
held
their
guns
ready
to
shoot
if
the
panther
should
make
up
his
mind
to
fight
them
after
a
while
the
sound
of
the
voices
changed
the
hunters
knew
from
this
that
the
panther
had
stopped
running
and
gone
up
into
a
tree
at
last
the
men
came
to
the
place
where
the
dogs
were
they
were
all
barking
round
a
tree
far
up
in
the
tree
was
the
beast
the
hunters
came
up
one
of
them
fired
the
bullet
hit
the
panther
but
did
not
kill
him
illustration
the
panther
sprang
to
the
ground
and
ran
off
again
the
dogs
ran
after
the
men
got
on
their
horses
and
rode
after
but
the
horses
were
tired
and
the
men
had
to
get
down
and
follow
the
dogs
on
foot
the
hunters
now
had
to
wade
through
little
ponds
of
water
sometimes
they
had
to
climb
over
fallen
trees
their
clothes
were
badly
torn
by
the
bushes
after
two
hours
more
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
panther
had
again
gone
up
into
a
tree
this
time
three
of
the
hunters
shot
at
him
the
fierce
panther
came
tumbling
to
the
ground
but
he
was
still
able
to
fight
the
men
fought
the
savage
beast
on
all
sides
at
last
they
killed
him
then
they
gave
his
skin
to
the
settler
they
wanted
him
to
know
that
his
was
dead
some

was
a
small
man

baby
his
head
was
too
big
for
his
body
his
father
used
to
send
the
baby
to
be
dipped
in
a
cold
spring
every
day
the
father
thought
that
putting
his
head
into
cold
water
would
keep
it
from
growing
knew
his
letters
before
he
was
a
year
and

very
little
fellow

wanted
to
be
a
poet

used
to
pray
that
he
might
be
a
poet

golden
curls
he
was
fond
of
all
the
great
poets
and
he
read
and
and
many
other
poets
as
soon
as
he
was
old
enough
to
them
grew
up
a
very
young
fellow
one
day
he
was
walking
in
the
woods
he
met
an
old
gypsy
woman
she
had
never
seen

angel
she
asked

when
was
a
boy

threw
a
crust
of
bread
at
him
it
hit
him
in
the
eye
he
became
almost
blind
he
had
to
do
his
writing
with
a
machine
this
machine
was
made
for
the
use
of
the
blind
there
were
no
in
those
days
it
was
hard
work
to
write
without
good
eyes
but
did
not
give
up
he
had
a
man
to
read
to
him
it
took
him
ten
years
to
write
his
first
book
when
prescott
had
finished
his
book
he
was
afraid
to
print
it
but
his
father
said
man
who
writes
a
book
and
is
afraid
to
print
it
is
a
then
prescott
printed
his
book
everybody
praised
it
when
you
are
older
you
will
like
to
read
his
doctor
holmes
the
poet
was
a
boy
full
of
fancies
he
lived
in
an
old
house
soldiers
had
staid
in
the
house
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
the
floor
of
one
room
was
all
battered
by
the
butts
of
the
muskets
illustration
little
holmes
used
to
think
he
could
hear
soldiers
in
the
house
he
thought
he
could
hear
their
spurs
rattling
in
the
dark
passages
sometimes
he
thought
he
could
hear
their
swords
clanking
the
little
boy
was
afraid
of
a
sign
that
hung
over
the
sidewalk
it
was
a
great
big
wooden
hand
it
was
the
sign
of
a
place
where
gloves
were
made
this
big
hand
swung
in
the
air
little
holmes
had
to
walk
under
it
on
his
way
to
school
he
thought
the
great
fingers
would
grab
him
some
day
then
he
thought
he
would
never
get
home
again
he
even
thought
that
his
other
pair
of
shoes
would
be
put
away
till
his
little
brother
grew
big
enough
to
wear
them
but
the
big
wooden
hand
never
caught
him
here
are
some
verses
that
doctor
holmes
wrote
about
a
very
old
man
has
poor
old
lady
she
is
dead
long
that
he
had
a
roman
nose
and
his
cheek
was
like
a
rose
in
the
snow
now
his
nose
is
thin
and
it
rests
upon
his
chin
like
a
staff
and
a
crook
is
in
his
back
and
a
crack
in
his
laugh
know
it
is
a
sin
for
me
to
sit
and
grin
at
him
here
but
the
old
hat
and
the
breeches
and
all
that
are
so
queer
if
i
should
live
to
be
the
last
leaf
upon
the
tree
in
the
spring
let
them
smile
as
i
do
now
at
the
old
bough
where
i
illustration
daniel
webster
and
his
brother
was
a
great
as
a
little
boy
he
was
called
black
when
he
grew
larger
he
was
thin
and
but
he
had
large
dark
eyes
people
called
him
he
was
very
fond
of
his
brother
was
a
little
older
than
both
the
boys
had
fine
minds
they
wanted
to
go
to
college
but
their
father
was
poor
had
not
much
strength
for
work
on
the
farm
so
little
was
sent
to
school
and
then
to
college
staid
at
home
and
worked
on
the
farm
while
daniel
was
at
school
he
was
unhappy
to
think
that
ezekiel
could
not
go
to
college
also
he
went
home
on
a
visit
he
talked
to
ezekiel
about
going
to
college
the
brothers
talked
about
it
all
night
the
next
day
daniel
talked
to
his
father
about
it
the
father
said
he
was
too
poor
to
send
both
of
his
sons
to
college
he
said
he
would
lose
all
his
little
property
if
he
tried
to
send
ezekiel
to
college
but
he
said
that
if
their
mother
and
sisters
were
willing
to
be
poor
he
would
send
the
other
son
to
college
so
the
mother
and
sisters
were
asked
it
seemed
hard
to
risk
the
loss
of
all
they
had
it
seemed
hard
not
to
give
ezekiel
a
chance
they
all
shed
tears
over
it
the
boys
promised
to
take
care
of
their
mother
and
sisters
if
the
property
should
be
lost
then
they
all
agreed
that
ezekiel
should
go
to
college
too
daniel
taught
school
while
he
was
studying
that
helped
to
pay
the
expenses
after
daniel
was
through
his
studies
in
college
he

so
cold
a
night

stand
and

would
go
on
again
illustration
webster
and
the
poor
woman
webster
kept
out
of

watched
her
after
looking
around
she
turned
down
the
street
in
which
webster
lived
she
stopped
in
front
of
house
she
looked
around
and
listened
webster
had
put
down
some
loose
boards
to
walk
on
they
reached
from
the
gate
to
the
door
of
his
house
after
standing
still
a
minute
the
woman
took
one
of
the
boards
and
went
off
quickly
webster
followed
her
but
he
kept
out
of
her
sight
she
went
to
a
distant
part
of
the
town
she
went
into
a
poor
little
house
webster
went
home
without
saying
anything
to
the
woman
he
knew
that
she
had
stolen
the
board
for
the
next
day
the
poor
woman
got
a
present
it
was
a
nice
load
of
wood
can
you
guess
who
sent
it
to
her
the
man
many
years
ago
a
man
was
sometimes
seen
in
the
streets
of
new
york
his
cap
was
made
of
rubber
so
was
his
coat
he
wore
a
rubber
even
his
cravat
was
of
rubber
he
wore
rubber
shoes
in
dry
weather
people
called
this
man
his
name
was
charles
he
was
very
poor
he
was
trying
to
find
out
how
to
make
india
rubber
useful
trees
grow
in
south
america
the
juice
of
these
trees
is
something
like
milk
or
cream
by
drying
this
juice
india
rubber
is
made
the
indians
in
have
no
glass
to
make
bottles
with
a
long
time
ago
they
learned
to
make
bottles
out
of
rubber
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
some
of
these
rubber
bottles
were
brought
to
this
country
the
people
in
this
country
had
never
seen
india
rubber
before
they
thought
the
bottles
made
out
of
it
by
the
indians
very
in
this
country
rubber
was
used
only
to
rub
out
pencil
marks
that
is
why
we
call
it
rubber
people
in
south
america
learned
to
make
a
kind
of
heavy
shoe
out
of
it
but
these
shoes
were
hard
to
make
they
cost
a
great
deal
when
they
were
sold
in
this
country
men
tried
to
make
rubber
shoes
in
this
country
they
got
the
rubber
from
rubber
shoes
made
in
this
country
were
cheaper
than
those
brought
from
south
america
but
they
were
not
good
they
would
freeze
till
they
were
as
hard
as
stones
in
winter
that
was
not
the
worst
of
it
in
summer
they
would
melt
goodyear
was
trying
to
find
out
a
way
to
make
rubber
better
he
wanted
to
get
it
so
that
it
would
not
melt
in
summer
he
wanted
to
get
a
rubber
that
would
not
get
hard
in
cold
weather
the
first
rubber
coats
that
were
made
were
so
hard
in
cold
weather
that
they
would
stand
alone
and
look
like
a
man
goodyear
wanted
to
try
his
rubber
that
is
why
he
wore
a
rubber
coat
and
a
rubber
and
a
rubber
cravat
that
is
why
he
wore
a
rubber
cap
and
rubber
shoes
when
it
was
not
raining
he
made
paper
out
of
rubber
and
wrote
a
book
on
it
he
had
a
made
of
it
he
even
carried
a
cane
made
of
india
rubber
it
is
no
wonder
people
called
him
the
man
he
was
very
poor
sometimes
he
had
to
borrow
money
to
buy
rubber
with
sometimes
his
friends
gave
him
money
to
keep
his
family
from
starving
sometimes
there
was
no
wood
and
no
coal
in
the
house
in
cold
weather
but
goodyear
kept
on
trying
he
thought
that
he
was
just
going
to
find
out
years
went
by
and
still
he
kept
on
trying
one
day
he
was
mixing
some
rubber
with
sulphur
it
slipped
out
of
his
hand
it
fell
on
the
hot
stove
but
it
did
not
melt
goodyear
was
happy
at
last
that
night
it
was
cold
goodyear
took
the
burned
piece
of
rubber
out
of
doors
and
nailed
it
to
the
kitchen
door
when
morning
came
he
went
and
got
it
it
had
not
frozen
he
was
now
sure
that
he
was
on
the
right
track
but
he
had
to
find
out
how
to
mix
and
heat
his
rubber
and
sulphur
he
was
too
poor
to
buy
rubber
to
try
with
nobody
would
lend
him
any
more
money
his
family
had
to
live
by
the
help
of
his
friends
he
had
already
sold
almost
everything
that
he
had
now
he
had
to
sell
his
to
get
money
to
buy
rubber
with
at
last
his
rubber
goods
were
made
and
sold
poor
men
who
had
to
stand
in
the
rain
could
now
keep
themselves
dry
people
could
walk
in
the
wet
with
dry
feet
a
great
many
people
are
alive
who
would
have
died
if
they
had
not
been
kept
dry
by
india
rubber
you
may
count
up
if
you
can
how
many
useful
things
are
made
of
rubber
we
owe
them
all
to
one
man
people
laughed
at
goodyear
once
but
at
last
they
praised
him
to
be
was
something
to
be
proud
of
doctor
kane
in
the
frozen
sea
illustration
kane
was
a
doctor
in
one
of
the
war
ships
of
the
united
states
he
had
sailed
about
the
world
a
great
deal
when
he
heard
that
ships
were
to
be
sent
into
the
icy
seas
of
the
north
he
asked
to
be
sent
along
he
went
the
first
time
as
a
doctor
then
he
wanted
to
find
out
more
about
the
frozen
ocean
so
he
went
again
as
captain
of
a
ship
his
ship
was
called
the
kane
sailed
into
the
icy
seas
his
ship
was
driven
far
into
the
ice
by
a
storm
she
was
crowded
by
at
one
time
she
was
lifted
clear
out
of
the
water
the
ship
seemed
ready
to
fall
over
on
her
side
but
the
ice
let
her
down
again
then
she
was
squeezed
till
the
men
thought
that
she
would
be
crushed
like
an
egg
shell
at
last
the
storm
stopped
then
came
the
awful
cold
the
ship
was
frozen
into
the
ice
the
ice
never
let
go
of
her
she
was
farther
north
than
any
ship
had
ever
been
before
but
she
was
so
fast
in
the
ice
that
she
never
could
get
away
in
that
part
of
the
world
it
is
night
nearly
all
winter
for
months
there
was
no
sun
at
all
daylight
came
again
it
was
now
summer
but
it
did
not
get
warm
doctor
kane
took
sleds
and
went
about
on
the
ice
to
see
what
he
could
see
the
sleds
were
drawn
by
large
dogs
but
nearly
all
of
the
dogs
died
in
the
long
winter
night
illustration
a
dog
sled
doctor
kane
thought
that
the
ice
would
melt
he
wanted
to
get
the
ship
out
but
the
ice
did
not
melt
at
all
at
last
the
summer
passed
away
another
awful
winter
came
the
sun
did
not
rise
any
more
it
was
dark
for
months
and
months
the
men
were
ill
some
of
them
died
they
were
much
but
kane
kept
up
his
heart
and
did
the
best
he
could
at
last
the
least
little
streak
of
light
could
be
seen
it
got
a
little
lighter
each
day
but
the
sick
men
down
in
the
cabin
of
the
ship
could
not
see
the
light
doctor
kane
said
to
himself
my
poor
men
could
see
this
sunlight
it
would
cheer
them
up
it
might
save
their
but
they
were
too
ill
to
get
out
where
they
could
see
the
sun
it
would
be
many
days
before
the
sun
would
shine
into
the
cabin
of
the
ship
the
men
might
die
before
that
time
so
doctor
kane
took
some
looking
glasses
up
to
the
deck
or
top
of
the
ship
he
fixed
one
of
these
so
it
would
catch
the
light
of
the
sun
then
he
fixed
another
so
that
the
first
one
would
throw
the
light
on
this
one
the
last
one
would
throw
the
sunlight
down
into
the
cabin
where
the
sick
men
were
one
day
the
poor
fellows
were
ready
to
give
up
then
the
sun
fell
on
the
looking
glasses
and
flashed
down
into
the
cabin
it
was
the
first
daylight
the
sick
men
had
seen
for
months
the
long
winter
night
was
over
think
how
happy
they
were
a
dinner
on
the
ice
after
two
winters
of
cold
and
darkness
doctor
kane
made
up
his
mind
to
leave
the
ship
fast
in
the
ice
he
wanted
to
get
to
a
place
in
where
there
were
people
living
then
he
might
find
some
way
of
getting
home
again
the
men
started
out
drawing
the
boats
on
sleds
whenever
they
came
to
open
water
they
put
the
boats
into
the
water
and
took
the
sleds
in
the
boats
when
they
came
to
the
ice
again
they
had
to
draw
out
their
boats
and
carry
them
on
the
sleds
at
first
they
could
travel
only
about
a
mile
a
day
it
was
a
hard
journey
some
of
the
men
were
ill
these
had
to
be
drawn
on
the
sleds
by
the
rest
they
had
not
enough
food
at
one
time
they
rested
three
days
in
a
kind
of
cave
here
they
found
many
eggs
these
made
very
good
food
for
them
at
another
place
they
staid
a
week
they
staid
just
to
eat
the
eggs
of
the
wild
birds
after
they
left
this
place
they
were
hungry
the
men
grew
thinner
and
thinner
it
seemed
that
they
must
die
for
want
of
food
but
one
day
they
saw
a
large
seal
he
was
floating
on
a
piece
of
ice
the
hungry
men
thought
a
fine
he
would
make
for
us
if
they
could
get
the
seal
they
would
not
die
of
hunger
every
one
of
the
poor
fellows
trembled
for
fear
the
seal
would
wake
up
a
man
named
took
a
gun
and
got
ready
to
shoot
the
men
rowed
the
boat
toward
the
seal
they
rowed
slowly
and
quietly
but
the
seal
waked
up
he
raised
his
head
the
men
thought
that
he
would
jump
off
into
the
water
then
they
might
all
die
for
want
of
food
doctor
kane
made
a
motion
to
that
was
to
tell
him
to
shoot
quickly
but
did
not
shoot
he
was
so
much
afraid
that
the
seal
would
get
away
that
he
could
not
shoot
the
seal
now
raised
himself
a
little
more
he
was
getting
ready
to
jump
into
the
water
just
then
petersen
fired
the
seal
fell
dead
on
the
ice
illustration
a
seal
the
men
were
wild
with
joy
they
rowed
the
boats
with
all
their
might
when
they
got
to
the
seal
they
dragged
it
farther
away
from
the
water
they
were
so
happy
that
they
danced
on
the
ice
some
of
them
laughed
some
were
so
glad
that
they
cried
illustration
shooting
the
seal
then
they
took
their
knives
and
began
to
cut
up
the
seal
they
had
no
fire
on
the
ice
and
they
were
too
hungry
to
think
of
lighting
one
so
they
ate
the
meat
of
the
seal
without
waiting
to
cook
it
doctor
kane
gets
out
of
the
frozen
sea
after
they
got
the
seal
doctor
kane
and
his
men
traveled
on
sometimes
they
were
on
the
ice
sometimes
they
were
in
the
boats
the
men
were
so
weak
that
they
could
hardly
row
the
boats
they
were
so
hungry
that
they
could
not
sleep
well
at
night
one
day
they
were
rowing
when
they
heard
a
sound
it
came
to
them
across
the
water
it
did
not
sound
like
the
cry
of
sea
birds
it
sounded
like
voices
doctor
kane
said
to
petersen
spoke
the
same
language
as
the
people
of
greenland
he
listened
the
sound
came
again
was
so
glad
that
he
could
hardly
speak
he
told
kane
in
a
half
whisper
that
it
was
the
voice
of
some
one
speaking
his
own
language
it
was
some
greenland
men
in
a
boat
the
next
day
they
got
to
a
greenland
town
then
they
got
into
a
little
ship
going
to
england

knew
that
they
could
get
home
from
england
but
the
ship
stopped
at
another
town
while

were
there

the
men
took
their
oars
and
rowed
this
time

rowed
with
all
their
might
they
held
up
the
little
flag
that
they
had
carried
farther
north
than
anybody
had
ever
been
before
they
rowed
straight
to
the
steamer

the
bow
of
the
boat

a
little
man
with
a
tattered
red

looking
at

all
died
this
steamer
had
been
sent
to
find
out
what
had
become
of
them
when
the
men
on

sent
up

was
very
one
day
he
took

never

could
not
think
of
anything

he
walked
up
and
down
in

paper
came
out
there
was
his
poem
it
was
signed

talked
about

that
evening
he
said

of
great

and
to
kit
carson
and
the
bears
great
men
of
one
kind
are
known
only
in
new
countries
like
ours
these
men
new
regions
they
know
how
to
manage
the
indians
they
show
other
people
how
to
live
in
a
wild
country
one
of
the
most
famous
of
such
men
was
kit
he
knew
all
about
the
wild
animals
he
was
a
great
hunter
he
learned
the
languages
of
the
indians
the
indians
liked
him
he
was
a
great
guide
he
showed
soldiers
and
settlers
how
to
travel
where
they
wished
to
go
once
he
was
marching
through
the
wild
country
with
other
men
evening
came
he
left
the
others
and
went
to
shoot
something
to
eat
it
was
the
only
way
to
get
meat
for
supper
when
he
had
gone
about
a
mile
he
saw
the
tracks
of
some
elks
he
followed
these
tracks
he
came
in
sight
of
the
elks
they
were
eating
grass
on
a
hill
as
cows
do
kit
crept
up
behind
some
bushes
but
elks
are
very
timid
animals
before
the
hunter
got
very
near
they
began
to
run
away
so
carson
fired
at
one
of
them
as
it
was
running
the
elk
fell
dead
but
just
at
that
moment
he
heard
a
roar
he
turned
to
see
what
made
this
ugly
noise
two
huge
bears
were
running
toward
him
they
wanted
some
meat
for
supper
too
kit
gun
was
empty
he
threw
it
down
then
he
ran
as
fast
as
he
could
he
wanted
to
find
a
tree
just
as
the
bears
were
about
to
seize
him
he
got
to
a
tree
he
caught
hold
of
a
limb
he
swung
himself
up
into
the
tree
the
bears
just
missed
getting
him
but
bears
know
how
to
climb
trees
carson
knew
that
they
would
soon
be
after
him
he
pulled
out
his
knife
and
began
to
cut
off
a
limb
he
wanted
to
make
a
club
a
bear
is
much
larger
and
stronger
than
a
man
he
can
not
be
killed
with
a
club
but
every
bear
has
one
tender
spot
it
is
his
nose
he
does
not
like
to
be
hit
on
the
nose
a
sharp
blow
on
the
nose
hurts
him
a
great
deal
kit
carson
got
his
club
cut
just
in
time
the
bears
were
coming
after
him
kit
got
up
into
the
very
top
of
the
tree
he
drew
up
his
feet
and
made
himself
as
small
as
he
could
when
the
bears
came
near
one
of
them
reached
for
kit
whack
went
the
stick
on
the
end
of
his
nose
the
bear
drew
back
and
whined
with
pain
first
one
bear
tried
to
get
him
and
then
the
other
but
one
tried
kit
was
ready
the
bear
was
sure
to
get
his
nose
hurt
illustration
the
bears
grew
tired
and
rested
awhile
but
they
kept
up
their
screeching
and
roaring
when
their
noses
felt
better
they
tried
again
and
then
they
tried
again
but
every
time
they
came
away
with
sore
noses
at
last
they
both
tried
at
once
but
carson
pounded
faster
than
ever
one
of
the
bears
cried
like
a
baby
the
tears
ran
out
of
his
eyes
it
hurt
his
feelings
to
have
his
nose
treated
in
this
rude
way
after
a
long
time
one
of
the
bears
got
tired
he
went
away
after
awhile
the
other
went
away
too
kit
carson
staid
in
the
tree
a
long
time
then
he
came
down
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
get
his
gun
he
loaded
it
but
the
bears
did
not
come
back
they
were
too
busy
rubbing
noses
horace
greeley
as
a
boy
was
the
son
of
a
poor
farmer
he
was
always
fond
of
books
he
learned
to
read
almost
as
soon
as
he
could
talk
he
could
read
easy
books
when
he
was
three
years
old
when
he
was
four
he
could
read
any
book
that
he
could
get
he
went
to
an
school
twice
a
day
all
the
children
stood
up
to
spell
they
were
in
two
classes
little
was
in
the
class
with
the
young
people
he
was
the
best
speller
in
the
class
it
was
funny
to
see
the
little
midget
at
the
head
of
this
class
of
older
people
but
he
was
only
a
little
boy
in
his
feelings
if
he
missed
a
word
he
would
cry
the
one
that
spelled
a
word
that
he
missed
would
have
a
right
to
take
the
head
of
the
class
sometimes
when
he
missed
the
big
boys
would
not
take
the
head
they
did
not
like
to
make
the
little
fellow
cry
he
was
the
pet
of
all
the
school
people
in
that
day
were
fond
of
spelling
they
used
to
hold
meetings
at
night
to
spell
they
called
these
at
a
spelling
school
two
captains
were
picked
out
these
chose
their
spellers
then
they
tried
to
see
which
side
could
beat
the
other
at
spelling
little
was
always
chosen
first
the
side
that
got
him
got
the
best
speller
in
the
school
sometimes
the
little
fellow
would
go
to
sleep
when
it
came
his
turn
to
spell
would
wake
him
up
he
would
rub
his
eyes
and
spell
the
word
he
would
spell
it
right
too
when
he
was
four
or
five
years
old
he
would
lie
under
a
tree
and
read
he
would
lie
there
and
forget
all
about
his
dinner
or
his
supper
he
would
not
move
until
stumbled
over
him
or
called
him
people
had
not
found
out
how
to
burn
oil
in
lamps
then
they
used
candles
but
poor
people
like
the
could
not
afford
to
burn
many
candles
gathered
pine
knots
to
read
by
at
night
illustration
greeley
reading
he
would
light
a
pine
knot
then
he
would
throw
it
on
top
of
the
large
log
at
the
back
of
the
fire
this
would
make
a
bright
light
horace
would
lay
all
the
books
he
wanted
on
the
hearth
then
he
would
lie
down
by
them
his
head
was
toward
the
fire
his
feet
were
drawn
up
out
of
the
way
the
first
thing
that
he
did
was
to
study
all
his
lessons
for
the
next
day
then
he
would
read
other
books
he
never
seemed
to
know
when
anybody
came
or
went
he
kept
on
with
his
reading
his
father
did
not
want
him
to
read
too
late
he
was
afraid
that
he
would
hurt
his
eyes
and
he
wanted
to
have
him
get
up
early
in
the
morning
to
help
with
the
work
so
when
nine
came
he
would
call
horace
horace
but
it
took
many
callings
to
rouse
him
when
he
got
to
bed
he
would
say
his
lessons
over
to
his
brother
he
would
tell
his
brother
what
he
had
been
reading
but
his
brother
would
fall
asleep
while
horace
was
talking
horace
liked
to
read
better
than
he
liked
to
work
but
when
he
had
a
task
to
do
he
did
it
his
brother
would
say
us
go
but
horace
would
answer
us
get
our
work
done
horace

grew
poorer
and
poorer
when

was
ten
years

his
land
was
sold

little
cabin

hard
like
all
the
rest
of

a
fellow
as
that
but
the
said
boy
will
be
a
great
man
some
this
made
all

seemed
funny
that

think
of

poor
boy

a
great
man
but
it
came
true
