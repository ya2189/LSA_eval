the
wrecker
by
robert
louis
stevenson
and
lloyd
osbourne
prologue
in
the
marquesas
it
was
about
three
of
a
winter
afternoon
in
the
french
capital
and
port
of
entry
of
the
marquesas
islands
the
trades
blew
strong
and
squally
the
surf
roared
loud
on
the
shingle
beach
and
the
schooner
of
war
that
carries
the
flag
and
influence
of
france
about
the
islands
of
the
cannibal
group
rolled
at
her
moorings
under
prison
hill
the
clouds
hung
low
and
black
on
the
surrounding
amphitheatre
of
mountains
rain
had
fallen
earlier
in
the
day
real
tropic
rain
a
waterspout
for
violence
and
the
green
and
gloomy
brow
of
the
mountain
was
still
seamed
with
many
silver
threads
of
torrent
in
these
hot
and
healthy
islands
winter
is
but
a
name
the
rain
had
not
refreshed
nor
could
the
wind
invigorate
the
dwellers
of
away
at
one
end
indeed
the
commandant
was
directing
some
changes
in
the
residency
garden
beyond
prison
hill
and
the
gardeners
being
all
convicts
had
no
choice
but
to
continue
to
obey
all
other
folks
slumbered
and
took
their
rest
vaekehu
the
native
queen
in
her
trim
house
under
the
rustling
palms
the
tahitian
commissary
in
his
beflagged
official
residence
the
merchants
in
their
deserted
stores
and
even
the
in
the
club
his
head
fallen
forward
on
the
under
the
map
of
the
world
and
the
cards
of
navy
officers
in
the
whole
length
of
the
single
shoreside
street
with
its
scattered
board
houses
looking
to
the
sea
its
grateful
shade
of
palms
and
green
jungle
of
puraos
no
moving
figure
could
be
seen
only
at
the
end
of
the
rickety
pier
that
once
in
the
prosperous
days
of
the
american
rebellion
was
used
to
groan
under
the
cotton
of
john
hart
there
might
have
been
spied
upon
a
pile
of
lumber
the
famous
tattooed
white
man
the
living
curiosity
of
his
eyes
were
open
staring
down
the
bay
he
saw
the
mountains
droop
as
they
approached
the
entrance
and
break
down
in
cliffs
the
surf
boil
white
round
the
two
sentinel
islets
and
between
on
the
narrow
bight
of
blue
horizon
upraise
the
ghost
of
her
pinnacled
mountain
tops
but
his
mind
would
take
no
account
of
these
familiar
features
as
he
dodged
in
and
out
along
the
frontier
line
of
sleep
and
waking
memory
would
serve
him
with
broken
fragments
of
the
past
brown
faces
and
white
of
skipper
and
shipmate
king
and
chief
would
arise
before
his
mind
and
vanish
he
would
recall
old
voyages
old
landfalls
in
the
hour
of
dawn
he
would
hear
again
the
drums
beat
for
a
festival
perhaps
he
would
summon
up
the
form
of
that
island
princess
for
the
love
of
whom
he
had
submitted
his
body
to
the
cruel
hands
of
the
tattooer
and
now
sat
on
the
lumber
at
the
of
so
strange
a
figure
of
a
european
or
perhaps
from
yet
further
back
sounds
and
scents
of
england
and
his
childhood
might
assail
him
the
merry
clamour
of
cathedral
bells
the
broom
upon
the
foreland
the
song
of
the
river
on
the
weir
it
is
bold
water
at
the
mouth
of
the
bay
you
can
steer
a
ship
about
either
sentinel
close
enough
to
toss
a
biscuit
on
the
rocks
thus
it
chanced
that
as
the
tattooed
man
sat
dozing
and
dreaming
he
was
startled
into
wakefulness
and
animation
by
the
appearance
of
a
flying
jib
beyond
the
western
islet
two
more
headsails
followed
and
before
the
tattooed
man
had
scrambled
to
his
feet
a
topsail
schooner
of
some
hundred
tons
had
luffed
about
the
sentinel
and
was
standing
up
the
bay
the
sleeping
city
awakened
by
enchantment
natives
appeared
upon
all
sides
hailing
each
other
with
the
magic
cry
ship
the
queen
stepped
forth
on
her
verandah
shading
her
eyes
under
a
hand
that
was
a
miracle
of
the
fine
art
of
tattooing
the
commandant
broke
from
his
domestic
convicts
and
ran
into
the
residency
for
his
glass
the
harbour
master
who
was
also
the
gaoler
came
speeding
down
the
prison
hill
the
seventeen
brown
kanakas
and
the
french
boatswain
mate
that
make
up
the
complement
of
the
crowded
on
the
forward
deck
and
the
various
english
americans
germans
poles
corsicans
and
scots
the
merchants
and
the
clerks
of
deserted
their
places
of
business
and
gathered
according
to
invariable
custom
on
the
road
before
the
club
so
quickly
did
these
dozen
whites
collect
so
short
are
the
distances
in
that
they
were
already
exchanging
guesses
as
to
the
nationality
and
business
of
the
strange
vessel
before
she
had
gone
about
upon
her
second
board
towards
the
anchorage
a
moment
after
english
colours
were
broken
out
at
the
main
truck
told
you
she
was
a
johnny
bull
knew
it
by
her
headsails
said
an
evergreen
old
salt
still
qualified
if
he
could
anywhere
have
found
an
owner
unacquainted
with
his
story
to
adorn
another
and
lose
another
ship
has
american
lines
anyway
said
the
astute
scots
engineer
of
the
my
belief
she
a
it
said
the
old
salt
yacht
look
at
her
davits
and
the
boat
over
the
yacht
in
your
eye
said
a
glasgow
voice
at
her
red
ensign
a
yacht
not
much
she
is
can
close
the
store
anyway

stanilas
moanatini
the
only
reasonably
busy
human
creature
on
the
island
was
riding
to
view
this
morning
landslip
on
the
mountain
road
the
sun
already
visibly
declined
night
was
imminent
and
if
he
would
avoid
the
perils
of
darkness
and
precipice
and
the
fear
of
the
dead
the
haunters
of
the
jungle
he
must
for
once
decline
a
hospitable
invitation
even
had
he
been
minded
to
alight
it
presently
appeared
there
would
be
difficulty
as
to
the
refreshment
offered
cried
the
glasgow
voice
such
a
thing
i
tell
you
only
eight
bottles
in
the
club
here
the
first
time
i
seen
british
colours
in
this
port
and
the
man
that
sails
under
them
has
got
to
drink
that
the
proposal
struck
the
public
mind
as
fair
though
far
from
cheering
for
some
time
back
indeed
the
very
name
of
beer
had
been
a
sound
of
sorrow
in
the
club
and
the
evenings
had
passed
in
dolorous
computation
is
havens
said
one
as
if
welcoming
a
fresh
topic
do
you
think
of
her
havens
do
think
replied
havens
a
tall
bland
leisurely
englishman
attired
in
spotless
duck
and
deliberately
dealing
with
a
cigarette
may
say
i
know
she
consigned
to
me
from
auckland
by
donald
edenborough
i
am
on
my
way
ship
is
she
asked
the
ancient
mariner
an
idea
returned
havens
tramp
they
have
with
that
he
placidly
resumed
his
walk
and
was
soon
seated
in
the
of
a
whaleboat
manned
by
uproarious
kanakas
himself
daintily
perched
out
of
the
way
of
the
least
maculation
giving
his
commands
in
an
unobtrusive
tone
of
voice
and
sweeping
neatly
enough
alongside
the
schooner
a
captain
received
him
at
the
gangway
are
consigned
to
us
i
think
said
he
am
is
right
sir
replied
the
captain
shaking
hands
will
find
the
owner
dodd
below
mind
the
fresh
paint
on
the
havens
stepped
along
the
and
descended
the
ladder
into
the
main
cabin
dodd
i
believe
said
he
addressing
a
smallish
bearded
gentleman
who
sat
writing
at
the
table
he
cried
loudon
dodd
my
dear
fellow
replied
dodd
springing
to
his
feet
with
companionable
alacrity
had
a
it
might
be
you
when
i
found
your
name
on
the
papers
well
there
no
change
in
you
still
the
same
placid
ca
return
the
compliment
for
you
seem
to
have
become
a
britisher
yourself
said
havens
promise
you
i
am
quite
unchanged
returned
dodd
red
tablecloth
at
the
top
of
the
stick
is
not
my
flag
it
my
partner
he
is
not
dead
but
sleepeth
there
he
is
he
added
pointing
to
a
bust
which
formed
one
of
the
numerous
unexpected
ornaments
of
that
unusual
cabin
havens
politely
studied
it
fine
bust
said
he
a
very
he
a
good
fellow
said
dodd
runs
me
now
it
all
his
does
seem
to
be
particularly
short
of
it
added
the
other
peering
with
growing
wonder
round
the
cabin
money
my
taste
said
dodd
bookshelves
are
old
english
the
books
all
mine
mostly
renaissance
french
you
should
see
how
the
wilt
away
when
they
go
round
them
looking
for
a
change
of
seaside
library
novels
the
mirrors
are
genuine
venice
a
good
piece
in
the
corner
the
daubs
are
mine
and
his
the
mudding
what
is
that
asked
havens
bronzes
replied
dodd
began
life
as
a
i
remember
something
about
that
said
the
other
think
too
you
said
you
were
interested
in
californian
real
i
never
went
so
far
as
that
said
dodd
i
guess
not
involved
perhaps
i
was
born
an
artist
i
never
took
an
interest
in
anything
but
art
if
i
were
to
pile
up
this
old
schooner
he
added
declare
i
believe
i
would
try
the
thing
again
inquired
havens
responded
dodd
some
fool
in
who
insures
us
and
comes
down
like
a
wolf
on
the
fold
on
the
profits
but
we
get
even
with
him
some
i
suppose
it
all
right
about
the
cargo
said
havens
i
suppose
so
replied
dodd
we
go
into
the
papers
have
all
you
know
said
havens
they
be
rather
expecting
you
at
the
club
de
of
course
loudon
you
dine
with
me
later
on
dodd
signified
his
acquiescence
drew
on
his
white
coat
not
without
a
trifling
difficulty
for
he
was
a
man
of
middle
age
and
arranged
his
beard
and
moustaches
at
one
of
the
venetian
mirrors
and
taking
a
broad
felt
hat
led
the
way
through
the
into
the
ship
waist
the
stern
boat
was
waiting
alongside
a
boat
of
an
elegant
model
with
cushions
and
polished
fittings
steer
observed
loudon
know
the
best
place
to
never
like
to
steer
another
man
boat
replied
havens
it
my
partner
and
cry
quits
returned
loudon
getting
nonchalantly
down
the
side
havens
followed
and
took
the
yoke
lines
without
further
protest
am
sure
i
do
know
how
you
make
this
pay
he
said
begin
with
she
is
too
big
for
the
trade
to
my
taste
and
then
you
carry
so
much
do
know
that
she
does
pay
returned
loudon
never
pretend
to
be
a
business
man
my
partner
appears
happy
and
the
money
is
all
his
as
i
told
you
i
only
bring
the
want
of
business
rather
like
the
berth
i
suppose
suggested
havens
said
loudon
seems
odd
but
i
rather
while
they
were
yet
on
board
the
sun
had
dipped
the
sunset
gun
a
rifle
cracked
from
the
and
the
colours
had
been
handed
down
dusk
was
deepening
as
they
came
ashore
and
the
cercle
internationale
as
the
club
is
officially
and
significantly
named
began
to
shine
from
under
its
low
verandas
with
the
light
of
many
lamps
the
good
hours
of
the
drew
on
the
hateful
poisonous
of
nukahiva
was
beginning
to
desist
from
its
activity
the
came
in
refreshing
draughts
and
the
club
men
gathered
together
for
the
hour
of
absinthe
to
the
commandant
himself
to
the
man
whom
he
was
then
contending
with
at
billiards
a
trader
from
the
next
island
honorary
member
of
the
club
and
once
carpenter
mate
on
board
a
yankee
to
the
doctor
of
the
port
to
the
brigadier
of
gendarmerie
to
the
opium
farmer
and
to
all
the
white
men
whom
the
tide
of
commerce
or
the
chances
of
shipwreck
and
desertion
had
stranded
on
the
beach
of
loudon
dodd
was
formally
presented
by
all
since
he
was
a
man
of
pleasing
exterior
smooth
ways
and
an
unexceptionable
flow
of
talk
whether
in
french
or
english
he
was
excellently
well
received
and
presently
with
one
of
the
last
eight
bottles
of
beer
on
a
table
at
his
elbow
found
himself
the
rather
silent
of
a
voluble
group
on
the
verandah
talk
in
the
south
seas
is
all
upon
one
pattern
it
is
a
wide
ocean
indeed
but
a
narrow
world
you
shall
never
talk
long
and
not
hear
the
name
of
bully
hayes
a
naval
hero
whose
exploits
and
deserved
extinction
left
europe
cold
commerce
will
be
touched
on
copra
shell
perhaps
cotton
or
fungus
but
in
a
dilettante
fashion
as
by
men
not
deeply
interested
through
all
the
names
of
schooners
and
their
captains
will
keep
coming
and
going
thick
as
and
news
of
the
last
shipwreck
will
be
placidly
exchanged
and
debated
to
a
stranger
this
conversation
will
at
first
seem
scarcely
brilliant
but
he
will
soon
catch
the
tone
and
by
the
time
he
shall
have
moved
a
year
or
so
in
the
island
world
and
come
across
a
good
number
of
the
schooners
so
that
every
captain
name
calls
up
a
figure
in
pyjamas
or
white
duck
and
becomes
used
to
a
certain
laxity
of
moral
tone
which
prevails
as
in
memory
of
hayes
on
smuggling
barratry
piracy
the
labour
trade
and
other
kindred
fields
of
human
activity
he
will
find
polynesia
no
less
amusing
and
no
less
instructive
than
pall
mall
or
paris
loudon
dodd
though
he
was
new
to
the
group
of
the
marquesas
was
already
an
old
salted
trader
he
knew
the
ships
and
the
captains
he
had
assisted
in
other
islands
at
the
first
steps
of
some
career
of
which
he
now
heard
the
culmination
or
vice
versa
he
had
brought
with
him
from
further
south
the
end
of
some
story
which
had
begun
in
among
other
matter
of
interest
like
other
arrivals
in
the
south
seas
he
had
a
wreck
to
announce
the
john
richards
it
appeared
had
met
the
fate
of
other
island
schooners
piled
her
up
on
palmerston
island
dodd
announced
were
the
owners
inquired
one
of
the
club
men
the
usual
parties
returned
loudon
a
smile
and
a
glance
of
intelligence
went
round
the
group
and
perhaps
loudon
gave
voice
to
the
general
sentiment
by
remarking
of
good
business
i
know
nothing
better
than
a
schooner
a
competent
captain
and
a
sound
reliable
business
there
no
such
a
thing
said
the
glasgow
man
makes
anything
but
the
missionaries
dash
it
do
know
said
another
a
good
deal
in
a
good
job
to
strike
a
tabooed
say
about
the
fourth
year

a
third

away
before

good
observed
a
german
something
in
wrecks
too
said
havens
at
that
man
in
honolulu
and
the
ship
that
went
ashore
on
waikiki
reef
it
was
blowing
a
kona
hard
and
she
began
to
break
up
as
soon
as
she
touched
agent
had
her
sold
inside
an
hour
and
before
dark
when
she
went
to
pieces
in
earnest
the
man
that
bought
her
had
feathered
his
nest
three
more
hours
of
daylight
and
he
might
have
retired
from
business
as
it
was
he
built
a
house
on
beretania
street
and
called
it
for
the
there
something
in
wrecks
sometimes
said
the
glasgow
voice
not
a
general
rule
there
deuced
little
in
anything
said
havens
i
believe
that
a
christian
fact
cried
the
other
i
want
is
a
secret
get
hold
of
a
rich
man
by
the
right
place
and
make
him
suppose
you
know
it
not
thought
to
be
the
ticket
returned
havens
do
care
for
that
it
good
enough
for
me
cried
the
man
from
glasgow
stoutly
only
devil
of
it
is
a
fellow
can
never
find
a
secret
in
a
place
like
the
south
seas
only
in
london
and
been
reading
some
i
suppose
said
one
club
man
been
reading
remarked
another
what
if
i
have
cried
all
true
look
at
the
newspapers
it
just
your
confounded
ignorance
that
sets
you
snickering
i
tell
you
it
as
much
a
trade
as
underwriting
and
a
dashed
sight
more
the
sudden
acrimony
of
these
remarks

loudon

a
sane
spot
then
suggested
some
one

loudon

loudon

peculiar
kind

some
one

it
was
rather

loudon

you

not
a

a

asked
the
glasgow

exactly

but
i
guess
he
could
buy
these
islands
if
he
what
was
wrong
then
could
you
get
hands
on
him
took
time
but
i
had
him
cornered
at
last
and
then
then
speculation
turned
bottom
up
i
became
the
man
bosom
deuce
you
did
could
have
been
particular
you

asked
dodd
pleasantly
no
he
a
man
of
rather
large
you
done
talking
nonsense
loudon
said
havens
be
getting
to
my
place
for
outside
the
night
was
full
of
the
roaring
of
the
surf
scattered
lights
glowed
in
the
green
thicket
native
women
came
by
twos
and
threes
out
of
the
darkness
smiled
and
ogled
the
two
whites
perhaps
wooed
them
with
a
strain
of
laughter
and
went
by
again
bequeathing
to
the
air
a
heady
perfume
of
and
frangipani
blossom
from
the
club
to
havens
residence
was
but
a
step
or
two
and
to
any
dweller
in
europe
they
must
have
seemed
steps
in
fairyland
if
such
an
one
could
but
have
followed
our
two
friends
into
the
house
sat
down
with
them
in
the
cool
trellised
room
where
the
wine
shone
on
the
tablecloth
tasted
of
their
exotic
food
the
raw
fish
the
breadfruit
the
cooked
bananas
the
roast
pig
served
with
the
inimitable
miti
and
that
king
of
delicacies
salad
seen
and
heard
by
fits
and
starts
now
peering
round
the
corner
of
the
door
now
railing
within
against
invisible
assistants
a
certain
comely
young
native
lady
in
a
sacque
who
seemed
too
modest
to
be
a
member
of
the
family
and
too
imperious
to
be
less
and
then
if
such
an
one
were
whisked
again
through
space
to
upper
tooting
or
wherever
else
he
honored
the
domestic
gods
have
had
a
dream
i
think
he
would
say
as
he
sat
up
rubbing
his
eyes
in
the
familiar
chair
have
had
a
dream
of
a
place
and
i
declare
i
believe
it
must
be
but
to
dodd
and
his
entertainer
all
this
amenity
of
the
tropic
night
and
all
these
dainties
of
the
island
table
were
grown
things
of
custom
and
they
fell
to
meat
like
men
who
were
hungry
and
drifted
into
idle
talk
like
men
who
were
a
trifle
bored
the
scene
in
the
club
was
referred
to
never
heard
you
talk
so
much
nonsense
loudon
said
the
host
it
seemed
to
me
there
was
sulphur
in
the
air
so
i
talked
for
talking
returned
the
other
it
was
none
of
it
you
mean
to
say
it
was
true
cried
havens
about
the
opium
and
the
wreck
and
the
blackmailing
and
the
man
who
became
your
friend
last
word
of
it
said
loudon
seem
to
have
been
seeing
life
returned
the
other
it
a
queer
yarn
said
his
friend
you
think
you
would
like
i
tell
it
here
follows
the
yarn
of
loudon
dodd
not
as
he
told
it
to
his
friend
but
as
he
subsequently
wrote
it
the
yarn
chapter
i
a
sound
commercial
education
the
beginning
of
this
yarn
is
my
poor
father
character
there
never
was
a
better
man
nor
a
handsomer
nor
in
my
view
a
more
unhappy
unhappy
in
his
business
in
his
pleasures
in
his
place
of
residence
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
in
his
son
he
had
begun
life
as
a
soon
became
interested
in
real
estate
branched
off
into
many
other
speculations
and
had
the
name
of
one
of
the
smartest
men
in
the
state
of
muskegon
has
a
big
head
people
used
to
say
but
i
was
never
so
sure
of
his
capacity
his
luck
at
least
was
beyond
doubt
for
long
his
assiduity
always
he
fought
in
that
daily
battle
of
with
a
kind
of
loyalty
like
a
martyr
rose
early
ate
fast
came
home
dispirited
and
even
from
success
grudged
himself
all
pleasure
if
his
nature
was
capable
of
taking
any
which
i
sometimes
wondered
and
laid
out
upon
some
deal
in
wheat
or
corner
in
aluminium
the
essence
of
which
was
little
better
than
highway
robbery
treasures
of
conscientiousness
and
unluckily
i
never
cared
a
cent
for
anything
but
art
and
never
shall
my
idea
of
man
chief
end
was
to
enrich
the
world
with
things
of
beauty
and
have
a
fairly
good
time
myself
while
doing
so
i
do
not
think
i
mentioned
that
second
part
which
is
the
only
one
i
have
managed
to
carry
out
but
my
father
must
have
suspected
the
suppression
for
he
branded
the
whole
affair
as
i
remember
crying
once
what
is
your
life
you
are
only
trying
to
get
money
and
to
get
it
from
other
people
at
he
sighed
bitterly
which
was
very
much
his
habit
and
shook
his
poor
head
at
me
loudon
loudon
said
he
boys
think
yourselves
very
smart
but
struggle
as
you
please
a
man
has
to
work
in
this
world
he
must
be
an
honest
man
or
a
thief
you
can
see
for
yourself
how
vain
it
was
to
argue
with
my
father
the
despair
that
seized
upon
me
after
such
an
interview
was
besides
embittered
by
remorse
for
i
was
at
times
petulant
but
he
invariably
gentle
and
i
was
fighting
after
all
for
my
own
liberty
and
pleasure
he
singly
for
what
he
thought
to
be
my
good
and
all
the
time
he
never
despaired
is
good
stuff
in
you
loudon
he
would
say
is
the
right
stuff
in
you
blood
will
tell
and
you
will
come
right
in
time
i
am
not
afraid
my
boy
will
ever
disgrace
me
i
am
only
vexed
he
should
sometimes
talk
and
then
he
would
pat
my
shoulder
or
my
hand
with
a
kind
of
motherly
way
he
had
very
affecting
in
a
man
so
strong
and
beautiful
as
soon
as
i
had
graduated
from
the
high
school
he
packed
me
off
to
the
muskegon
commercial
academy
you
are
a
foreigner
and
you
will
have
a
difficulty
in
accepting
the
reality
of
this
seat
of
education
i
assure
you
before
i
begin
that
i
am
wholly
serious
the
place
really
existed
possibly
exists
we
were
proud
of
it
in
the
state
as
something
exceptionally
nineteenth
century
and
civilized
and
my
father
when
he
saw
me
to
the
cars
no
doubt
considered
he
was
putting
me
in
a
straight
line
for
the
presidency
and
the
new
jerusalem
said
he
am
now
giving
you
a
chance
that
julius
caesar
could
not
have
given
to
his
son
a
chance
to
see
life
as
it
is
before
your
own
turn
comes
to
start
in
earnest
avoid
rash
speculation
try
to
behave
like
a
gentleman
and
if
you
will
take
my
advice
confine
yourself
to
a
safe
conservative
business
in
railroads
breadstuffs
are
tempting
but
very
dangerous
i
would
not
try
breadstuffs
at
your
time
of
life
but
you
may
feel
your
way
a
little
in
other
commodities
take
a
pride
to
keep
your
books
posted
and
never
throw
good
money
after
bad
there
my
dear
boy
kiss
me
and
never
forget
that
you
are
an
only
chick
and
that
your
dad
watches
your
career
with
fond
the
commercial
college
was
a
fine
roomy
establishment
pleasantly
situate
among
woods
the
air
was
healthy
the
food
excellent
the
premium
high
electric
wires
connected
it
to
use
the
words
of
the
prospectus
with
various
world
the
was
well
supplied
with
the
talk
was
that
of
wall
street
and
the
pupils
from
fifty
to
a
hundred
lads
were
principally
engaged
in
rooking
or
trying
to
rook
one
another
for
nominal
sums
in
what
was
called
we
had
class
hours
indeed
in
the
morning
when
we
studied
german
french
and
the
like
goodly
matters
but
the
bulk
of
our
day
and
the
gist
of
the
education
centred
in
the
exchange
where
we
were
taught
to
gamble
in
produce
and
securities
since
not
one
of
the
participants
possessed
a
bushel
of
wheat
or
a
dollar
worth
of
stock
legitimate
business
was
of
course
impossible
from
the
beginning
it
was
gambling
without
colour
or
disguise
just
that
which
is
the
impediment
and
destruction
of
all
genuine
commercial
enterprise
just
that
we
were
taught
with
every
luxury
of
stage
effect
our
simulacrum
of
a
market
was
ruled
by
the
real
markets
outside
so
that
we
might
experience
the
course
and
vicissitude
of
prices
we
must
keep
books
and
our
ledgers
were
overhauled
at
the
month
end
by
the
principal
or
his
assistants
to
add
a
spice
of
verisimilitude
like
poker
chips
had
an
actual
marketable
value
it
was
bought
for
each
pupil
by
anxious
parents
and
guardians
at
the
rate
of
one
cent
for
the
dollar
the
same
pupil
when
his
education
was
complete
resold
at
the
same
figure
so
much
as
was
left
him
to
the
college
and
even
in
the
midst
of
his
curriculum
a
successful
operator
would
sometimes
realize
a
proportion
of
his
holding
and
stand
a
supper
on
the
sly
in
the
neighbouring
hamlet
in
short
if
there
was
ever
a
worse
education
it
must
have
been
in
that
academy
where
oliver
met
charlie
bates
when
i
was
first
guided
into
the
exchange
to
have
my
desk
pointed
out
by
one
of
the
assistant
teachers
i
was
overwhelmed
by
the
clamour
and
confusion
certain
blackboards
at
the
other
end
of
the
building
were
covered
with
figures
continually
replaced
as
each
new
set
appeared
the
pupils
swayed
to
and
fro
and
roared
out
aloud
with
a
formidable
and
to
me
quite
meaningless
vociferation
leaping
at
the
same
time
upon
the
desks
and
benches
signalling
with
arms
and
heads
and
scribbling
briskly
in
i
thought
i
had
never
beheld
a
scene
more
disagreeable
and
when
i
considered
that
the
whole
traffic
was
illusory
and
all
the
money
then
upon
the
market
would
scarce
have
sufficed
to
buy
a
pair
of
skates
i
was
at
first
astonished
although
not
for
long
indeed
i
had
no
sooner
called
to
mind
how
men
and
women
of
considerable
estate
will
lose
their
temper
about
points
than
making
an
immediate
allowance
for
my
i
transferred
the
whole
of
my
astonishment
to
the
assistant
teacher
who
poor
gentleman
had
quite
forgot
to
show
me
to
my
desk
and
stood
in
the
midst
of
this
absorbed
and
seemingly
transported
look
he
shouted
in
my
ear
falling
market
the
bears
have
had
it
all
their
own
way
since
ca
matter
i
replied
making
him
hear
with
difficulty
for
i
was
unused
to
speak
in
such
a
babel
it
is
all
said
he
you
must
always
bear
in
mind
that
the
real
profit
is
in
the
i
trust
dodd
to
be
able
to
congratulate
you
upon
your
books
you
are
to
start
in
with
ten
thousand
dollars
of
college
paper
a
very
liberal
figure
which
should
see
you
through
the
whole
curriculum
if
you
keep
to
a
safe
conservative
business
why
what
that
he
broke
off
once
more
attracted
by
the
changing
figures
on
the
board
four
three
dodd
you
are
in
luck
this
is
the
most
spirited
rally
we
have
had
this
term
and
to
think
that
the
same
scene
is
now
transpiring
in
new
york
chicago
louis
and
rival
business
centres
for
two
cents
i
would
try
a
flutter
with
the
boys
myself
he
cried
rubbing
his
hands
it
against
the
would
you
do
sir
i
asked
he
cried
with
glittering
eyes
for
all
i
was
worth
that
be
a
safe
conservative
business
i
inquired
as
innocent
as
a
lamb
he
looked
daggers
at
me
that
man
in
glasses
he
asked
as
if
to
change
the
subject
billson
our
most
prominent
undergraduate
we
build
confidently
on
billson
future
you
could
not
do
better
dodd
than
follow
presently
after
in
the
midst
of
a
still
growing
tumult
the
figures
coming
and
going
more
busily
than
ever
on
the
board
and
the
hall
resounding
like
pandemonium
with
the
howls
of
operators
the
assistant
teacher
left
me
to
my
own
resources
at
my
desk
the
next
boy
was
posting
up
his
ledger
figuring
his
morning
loss
as
i
discovered
later
on
and
from
this
ungenial
task
he
was
readily
diverted
by
the
sight
of
a
new
face
freshman
he
said
your
name
what
son
of
big
head
dodd
what
your
figure
ten
thousand
o
you
away
up
what
a
clam
you
must
be
to
touch
your
books
i
asked
him
what
else
i
could
do
since
the
books
were
to
be
examined
once
a
month
you
galoot
you
get
a
clerk
cries
he
of
our
dead
beats
that
all
they
here
for
if
you
a
successful
operator
you
need
never
do
a
stroke
of
work
in
this
old
the
noise
had
now
become
deafening
and
my
new
friend
telling
me
that
some
one
had
certainly
down
that
he
must
know
the
news
and
that
he
would
bring
me
a
clerk
when
he
returned
buttoned
his
coat
and
plunged
into
the
tossing
throng
it
proved
that
he
was
right
some
one
had
gone
down
a
prince
had
fallen
in
israel
the
corner
in
lard
had
proved
fatal
to
the
mighty
and
the
clerk
who
was
brought
back
to
keep
my
books
spare
me
all
work
and
get
all
my
share
of
the
education
at
a
thousand
dollars
a
month
college
paper
ten
dollars
united
states
currency
was
no
other
than
the
prominent
billson
whom
i
could
do
no
better
than
follow
the
poor
lad
was
very
unhappy
it
the
only
good
thing
i
have
to
say
for
muskegon
commercial
college
that
we
were
all
even
the
small
fry
deeply
mortified
to
be
posted
as
defaulters
and
the
collapse
of
a
merchant
prince
like
billson
who
had
ridden
pretty
high
in
his
days
of
prosperity
was
of
course
particularly
hard
to
bear
but
the
spirit
of
conquered
even
the
bitterness
of
recent
shame
and
my
clerk
took
his
orders
and
fell
to
his
new
duties
with
decorum
and
civility
such
were
my
first
impressions
in
this
absurd
place
of
education
and
to
be
frank
they
were
far
from
disagreeable
as
long
as
i
was
rich
my
evenings
and
afternoons
would
be
my
own
the
clerk
must
keep
my
books
the
clerk
could
do
the
jostling
and
bawling
in
the
exchange
and
i
could
turn
my
mind
to
and
balzac
novels
which
were
then
my
two
preoccupations
to
remain
rich
then
became
my
problem
or
in
other
words
to
do
a
safe
conservative
line
of
business
i
am
looking
for
that
line
still
and
i
believe
the
nearest
thing
to
it
in
this
imperfect
world
is
the
sort
of
speculation
sometimes
insidiously
proposed
to
childhood
in
the
formula
i
win
tails
you
mindful
of
my
father
parting
words
i
turned
my
attention
timidly
to
railroads
and
for
a
month
or
so
maintained
a
position
of
inglorious
security
dealing
for
small
amounts
in
the
most
inert
stocks
and
bearing
as
best
i
could
the
scorn
of
my
hired
clerk
one
day
i
had
ventured
a
little
further
by
way
of
experiment
and
in
the
sure
expectation
they
would
continue
to
go
down
sold
several
thousand
dollars
of
preference
i
think
it
was
i
had
no
sooner
made
this
venture
than
some
fools
in
new
york
began
to
bull
the
market
rose
like
a
balloon
and
in
the
inside
of
half
an
hour
i
saw
my
position
compromised
blood
will
tell
as
my
father
said
and
i
stuck
to
it
gallantly
all
afternoon
i
continued
selling
that
infernal
stock
all
afternoon
it
continued
skying
i
suppose
i
had
come
a
frail
athwart
the
hawse
of
jay
gould
and
indeed
i
think
i
remember
that
this
vagary
in
the
market
proved
subsequently
to
be
the
first
move
in
a
considerable
deal
that
evening
at
least
the
name
of
loudon
dodd
held
the
first
rank
in
our
collegiate
gazette
and
i
and
billson
once
more
thrown
upon
the
world
were
competing
for
the
same
clerkship
the
present
object
takes
the
present
eye
my
disaster
for
the
moment
was
the
more
conspicuous
and
it
was
i
that
got
the
situation
so
you
see
even
in
muskegon
commercial
college
there
were
lessons
to
be
learned
for
my
own
part
i
cared
very
little
whether
i
lost
or
won
at
a
game
so
random
so
complex
and
so
dull
but
it
was
sorry
news
to
write
to
my
poor
father
and
i
employed
all
the
resources
of
my
eloquence
i
told
him
what
was
the
truth
that
the
successful
boys
had
none
of
the
education
so
that
if
he
wished
me
to
learn
he
should
rejoice
at
my
misfortune
i
went
on
not
very
consistently
to
beg
him
to
set
me
up
again
when
i
would
solemnly
promise
to
do
a
safe
business
in
reliable
railroads
lastly
becoming
somewhat
carried
away
i
assured
him
i
was
totally
unfit
for
business
and
implored
him
to
take
me
away
from
this
abominable
place
and
let
me
go
to
paris
to
study
art
he
answered
briefly
gently
and
sadly
telling
me
the
vacation
was
near
at
hand
when
we
could
talk
things
over
when
the
time
came
he
met
me
at
the
depot
and
i
was
shocked
to
see
him
looking
older
he
seemed
to
have
no
thought
but
to
console
me
and
restore
what
he
supposed
i
had
lost
my
courage
i
must
not
be
many
of
the
best
men
had
made
a
failure
in
the
beginning
i
told
him
i
had
no
head
for
business
and
his
kind
face
darkened
must
not
say
that
loudon
he
replied
will
never
believe
my
son
to
be
a
i
do
like
it
i
pleaded
has
got
any
interest
for
me
and
art
has
i
know
i
could
do
more
in
art
and
i
reminded
him
that
a
successful
painter
gains
large
sums
that
a
picture
of
would
sell
for
many
thousand
dollars
do
you
think
loudon
he
replied
a
man
who
can
paint
a
thousand
dollar
picture
has
not
grit
enough
to
keep
his
end
up
in
the
stock
market
no
sir
this
mason
of
whom
you
speak
or
our
own
american
bierstadt
if
you
were
to
put
them
down
in
a
wheat
pit
they
would
show
their
mettle
come
loudon
my
dear
heaven
knows
i
have
no
thought
but
your
own
good
and
i
will
offer
you
a
bargain
i
start
you
again
next
term
with
ten
thousand
dollars
show
yourself
a
man
and
double
it
and
then
if
you
still
wish
to
go
to
paris
which
i
know
you
wo
i
let
you
go
but
to
let
you
run
away
as
if
you
were
whipped
is
what
i
am
too
proud
to
my
heart
leaped
at
this
proposal
and
then
sank
again
it
seemed
easier
to
paint
a
meissonier
on
the
spot
than
to
win
ten
thousand
dollars
on
that
mimic
stock
exchange
nor
could
i
help
reflecting
on
the
singularity
of
such
a
test
for
a
man
capacity
to
be
a
painter
i
ventured
even
to
comment
on
this
he
sighed
deeply
forget
my
dear
said
he
am
a
judge
of
the
one
and
not
of
the
other
you
might
have
the
genius
of
bierstadt
himself
and
i
would
be
none
the
then
i
continued
scarcely
fair
the
other
boys
are
helped
by
their
people
who
telegraph
and
give
them
pointers
there
jim
costello
who
never
budges
without
a
word
from
his
father
in
new
york
and
then
do
you
see
if
anybody
is
to
win
somebody
must
lose
keep
you
posted
cried
my
father
with
unusual
animation
did
not
know
it
was
allowed
i
wire
you
in
the
office
cipher
and
make
it
a
kind
of
partnership
business
loudon
dodd
son
eh
and
he
patted
my
shoulder
and
repeated
son
dodd
son
with
the
kindliest
amusement
if
my
father
was
to
give
me
pointers
and
the
commercial
college
was
to
be
a
to
paris
i
could
look
my
future
in
the
face
the
old
boy
too
was
so
pleased
at
the
idea
of
our
association
in
this
foolery
that
he
immediately
plucked
up
spirit
thus
it
befell
that
those
who
had
met
at
the
depot
like
a
pair
of
mutes
sat
down
to
table
with
holiday
faces
and
now
i
have
to
introduce
a
new
character
that
never
said
a
word
nor
wagged
a
finger
and
yet
shaped
my
whole
subsequent
career
you
have
crossed
the
states
so
that
in
all
likelihood
you
have
seen
the
head
of
it
and
curiously
fluted
rising
among
trees
from
a
wide
plain
for
this
new
character
was
no
other
than
the
state
capitol
of
muskegon
then
first
projected
my
father
had
embraced
the
idea
with
a
mixture
of
patriotism
and
commercial
greed
both
perfectly
genuine
he
was
of
all
the
committees
he
had
subscribed
a
great
deal
of
money
and
he
was
making
arrangements
to
have
a
finger
in
most
of
the
contracts
competitive
plans
had
been
sent
in
at
the
time
of
my
return
from
college
my
father
was
deep
in
their
consideration
and
as
the
idea
entirely
occupied
his
mind
the
first
evening
did
not
pass
away
before
he
had
called
me
into
council
here
was
a
subject
at
last
into
which
i
could
throw
myself
with
pleasurable
zeal
architecture
was
new
to
me
indeed
but
it
was
at
least
an
art
and
for
all
the
arts
i
had
a
taste
naturally
classical
and
that
capacity
to
take
delighted
pains
which
some
famous
idiot
has
supposed
to
be
synonymous
with
genius
i
threw
myself
headlong
into
my
father
work
acquainted
myself
with
all
the
plans
their
merits
and
defects
read
besides
in
special
books
made
myself
a
master
of
the
theory
of
strains
studied
the
current
prices
of
materials
and
in
one
word
the
whole
business
so
thoroughly
that
when
the
plans
came
up
for
consideration
big
head
dodd
was
supposed
to
have
earned
fresh
laurels
his
arguments
carried
the
day
his
choice
was
approved
by
the
committee
and
i
had
the
anonymous
satisfaction
to
know
that
arguments
and
choice
were
wholly
mine
in
the
recasting
of
the
plan
which
followed
my
part
was
even
larger
for
i
designed
and
cast
with
my
own
hand
a
grating
for
the
offices
which
had
the
luck
or
merit
to
be
accepted
the
energy
and
aptitude
which
i
displayed
throughout
delighted
and
surprised
my
father
and
i
believe
although
i
say
it
whose
tongue
should
be
tied
that
they
alone
prevented
muskegon
capitol
from
being
the
eyesore
of
my
native
state
altogether
i
was
in
a
cheery
frame
of
mind
when
i
returned
to
the
commercial
college
and
my
earlier
operations
were
crowned
with
a
full
measure
of
success
my
father
wrote
and
wired
to
me
continually
are
to
exercise
your
own
judgment
loudon
he
would
say
that
i
do
is
to
give
you
the
figures
but
whatever
operation
you
take
up
must
be
upon
your
own
responsibility
and
whatever
you
earn
will
be
entirely
due
to
your
own
dash
and
for
all
that
it
was
always
clear
what
he
intended
me
to
do
and
i
was
always
careful
to
do
it
inside
of
a
month
i
was
at
the
head
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
thousand
dollars
college
paper
and
here
i
fell
a
victim
to
one
of
the
vices
of
the
system
the
paper
i
have
already
explained
had
a
real
value
of
one
per
cent
and
cost
and
could
be
sold
for
currency
unsuccessful
speculators
were
thus
always
selling
clothes
books
banjos
and
in
order
to
pay
their
differences
the
successful
on
the
other
hand
were
often
tempted
to
realise
and
enjoy
some
return
upon
their
profits
now
i
wanted
thirty
dollars
worth
of
for
i
was
always
sketching
in
the
woods
my
allowance
was
for
the
time
exhausted
i
had
begun
to
regard
the
exchange
with
my
father
help
as
a
place
where
money
was
to
be
got
for
stooping
and
in
an
evil
hour
i
realised
three
thousand
dollars
of
the
college
paper
and
bought
my
easel
it
was
a
wednesday
morning
when
the
things
arrived
and
set
me
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
satisfaction
my
father
for
i
can
scarcely
say
myself
was
trying
at
this
time
a
in
wheat
between
chicago
and
new
york
the
operation
so
called
is
as
you
know
one
of
the
most
tempting
and
least
safe
upon
the
of
finance
on
the
thursday
luck
began
to
turn
against
my
father
calculations
and
by
the
friday
evening
i
was
posted
on
the
boards
as
a
defaulter
for
the
second
time
here
was
a
rude
blow
my
father
would
have
taken
it
ill
enough
in
any
case
for
however
much
a
man
may
resent
the
incapacity
of
an
only
son
he
will
feel
his
own
more
sensibly
but
it
chanced
that
in
our
bitter
cup
of
failure
there
was
one
ingredient
that
might
truly
be
called
poisonous
he
had
been
keeping
the
run
of
my
position
he
missed
the
three
thousand
dollars
paper
and
in
his
view
i
had
stolen
thirty
dollars
currency
it
was
an
extreme
view
perhaps
but
in
some
senses
it
was
just
and
my
father
although
to
my
judgment
quite
reckless
of
honesty
in
the
essence
of
his
operations
was
the
soul
of
honour
as
to
their
details
i
had
one
grieved
letter
from
him
dignified
and
tender
and
during
the
rest
of
that
wretched
term
working
as
a
clerk
selling
my
clothes
and
sketches
to
make
futile
speculations
my
dream
of
paris
quite
vanished
i
was
cheered
by
no
word
of
kindness
and
helped
by
no
hint
of
counsel
from
my
father
all
the
time
he
was
no
doubt
thinking
of
little
else
but
his
son
and
what
to
do
with
him
i
believe
he
had
been
really
appalled
by
what
he
regarded
as
my
laxity
of
principle
and
began
to
think
it
might
be
well
to
preserve
me
from
temptation
the
architect
of
the
capitol
had
besides
spoken
obligingly
of
my
design
and
while
he
was
thus
hanging
between
two
minds
fortune
suddenly
stepped
in
and
muskegon
state
capitol
reversed
my
destiny
said
my
father
as
he
met
me
at
the
depot
with
a
smiling
countenance
you
were
to
go
to
paris
how
long
would
it
take
you
to
become
an
experienced
sculptor
do
you
mean
father
i
cried
man
that
could
be
entrusted
with
the
highest
styles
he
answered
nude
for
instance
and
the
patriotic
and
emblematical
might
take
three
years
i
replied
think
paris
necessary
he
asked
are
great
advantages
in
our
own
country
and
that
man
prodgers
appears
to
be
a
very
clever
sculptor
though
i
suppose
he
stands
too
high
to
go
around
giving
is
the
only
place
i
assured
him
i
think
myself
it
will
sound
better
he
admitted
young
man
a
native
of
this
state
son
of
a
leading
citizen
studies
prosecuted
under
the
most
experienced
masters
in
paris
he
added
relishingly
my
dear
dad
what
is
it
all
about
i
interrupted
never
even
dreamed
of
being
a
here
it
is
said
he
took
up
the
statuary
contract
on
our
new
capitol
i
took
it
up
at
first
as
a
deal
and
then
it
occurred
to
me
it
would
be
better
to
keep
it
in
the
family
it
meets
your
idea
considerable
money
in
the
thing
and
it
patriotic
so
if
you
say
the
word
you
shall
go
to
paris
and
come
back
in
three
years
to
decorate
the
capitol
of
your
native
state
it
a
big
chance
for
you
loudon
and
i
tell
you
what
every
dollar
you
earn
i
put
another
alongside
of
it
but
the
sooner
you
go
and
the
harder
you
work
the
better
for
if
the
first
statues
are
in
a
line
with
public
taste
in
muskegon
there
will
be
chapter
ii
roussillon
wine
my
mother
family
was
scotch
and
it
was
judged
fitting
i
should
pay
a
visit
on
my
way
to
my
uncle
adam
loudon
a
wealthy
retired
grocer
of
edinburgh
he
was
very
stiff
and
very
ironical
he
fed
me
well
lodged
me
sumptuously
and
seemed
to
take
it
out
of
me
all
the
time
cent
per
cent
in
secret
entertainment
which
caused
his
spectacles
to
glitter
and
his
mouth
to
twitch
the
ground
of
this
mirth
as
well
as
i
could
make
out
was
simply
the
fact
that
i
was
an
american
he
would
say
drawing
out
the
word
to
infinity
i
suppose
now
in
your
country
things
will
be
so
and
and
the
whole
group
of
my
cousins
would
titter
joyously
repeated
receptions
of
this
sort
must
be
at
the
root
i
suppose
of
what
they
call
the
great
american
jest
and
i
know
i
was
myself
goaded
into
saying
that
my
friends
went
naked
in
the
summer
months
and
that
the
second
methodist
episcopal
church
in
muskegon
was
decorated
with
scalps
i
can
not
say
that
these
flights
had
any
great
success
they
seemed
to
awaken
little
more
surprise
than
the
fact
that
my
father
was
a
republican
or
that
i
had
been
taught
in
school
to
spell
colour
without
the
u
if
i
had
told
them
what
was
after
all
the
truth
that
my
father
had
paid
a
considerable
annual
sum
to
have
me
brought
up
in
a
gambling
hell
the
tittering
and
grinning
of
this
dreadful
family
might
perhaps
have
been
excused
i
can
not
deny
but
i
was
sometimes
tempted
to
knock
my
uncle
adam
down
and
indeed
i
believe
it
must
have
come
to
a
rupture
at
last
if
they
had
not
given
a
dinner
party
at
which
i
was
the
lion
on
this
occasion
i
learned
to
my
surprise
and
relief
that
the
incivility
to
which
i
had
been
subjected
was
a
matter
for
the
family
circle
and
might
be
regarded
almost
in
the
light
of
an
endearment
to
strangers
i
was
presented
with
consideration
and
the
account
given
of
american
poor
janie
man
james
dodd
the
millionnaire
of
muskegon
was
calculated
to
enlarge
the
heart
of
a
proud
son
an
aged
assistant
of
my
grandfather
a
pleasant
humble
creature
with
a
taste
for
whiskey
was
at
first
deputed
to
be
my
guide
about
the
city
with
this
harmless
but
hardly
aristocratic
companion
i
went
to
seat
and
the
calton
hill
heard
the
band
play
in
the
princes
street
gardens
inspected
the
regalia
and
the
blood
of
rizzio
and
fell
in
love
with
the
great
castle
on
its
cliff
the
innumerable
spires
of
churches
the
stately
buildings
the
broad
prospects
and
those
narrow
and
crowded
lanes
of
the
old
town
where
my
ancestors
had
lived
and
died
in
the
days
before
columbus
but
there
was
another
curiosity
that
interested
me
more
deeply
my
grandfather
alexander
loudon
in
his
time
the
old
gentleman
had
been
a
working
mason
and
had
risen
from
the
ranks
more
i
think
by
shrewdness
than
by
merit
in
his
appearance
speech
and
manners
he
bore
broad
marks
of
his
origin
which
were
gall
and
wormwood
to
my
uncle
adam
his
nails
in
spite
of
anxious
supervision
were
often
in
conspicuous
mourning
his
clothes
hung
about
him
in
bags
and
wrinkles
like
a
ploughman
sunday
coat
his
accent
was
rude
broad
and
dragging
take
him
at
his
best
and
even
when
he
could
be
induced
to
hold
his
tongue
his
mere
presence
in
a
corner
of
the
with
his
wrinkles
his
scanty
hair
his
battered
hands
and
the
cheerful
craftiness
of
his
expression
advertised
the
whole
gang
of
us
for
a
family
my
aunt
might
mince
and
my
cousins
bridle
but
there
was
no
getting
over
the
solid
physical
fact
of
the
stonemason
in
the
that
is
one
advantage
of
being
an
american
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
be
ashamed
of
my
grandfather
and
the
old
gentleman
was
quick
to
mark
the
difference
he
held
my
mother
in
tender
memory
perhaps
because
he
was
in
the
habit
of
daily
contrasting
her
with
uncle
adam
whom
he
detested
to
the
point
of
frenzy
and
he
set
down
to
inheritance
from
his
favourite
my
own
becoming
treatment
of
himself
on
our
walks
abroad
which
soon
became
daily
he
would
sometimes
after
duly
warning
me
to
keep
the
matter
dark
from
skulk
into
some
old
familiar
and
there
if
he
had
the
luck
to
encounter
any
of
his
veteran
cronies
he
would
present
me
to
the
company
with
manifest
pride
casting
at
the
same
time
a
covert
slur
on
the
rest
of
his
descendants
is
my
jeannie
yin
he
would
say
a
fine
fallow
the
purpose
of
our
excursions
was
not
to
seek
antiquities
or
to
enjoy
famous
prospects
but
to
visit
one
after
another
a
series
of
doleful
suburbs
for
which
it
was
the
old
gentleman
chief
claim
to
renown
that
he
had
been
the
sole
contractor
and
too
often
the
architect
besides
i
have
rarely
seen
a
more
shocking
exhibition
the
bricks
seemed
to
be
blushing
in
the
walls
and
the
slates
on
the
roof
to
have
turned
pale
with
shame
but
i
was
careful
not
to
communicate
these
impressions
to
the
aged
artificer
at
my
side
and
when
he
would
direct
my
attention
to
some
fresh
monstrosity
perhaps
with
the
comment
an
idee
of
mine
it
cheap
and
tasty
and
had
a
graand
run
the
idee
was
soon
stole
and
there
whole
deestricts
near
glesgie
with
the
goathic
adeetion
and
that
plunth
i
would
civilly
make
haste
to
admire
and
what
i
found
particularly
delighted
him
to
inquire
into
the
cost
of
each
adornment
it
will
be
conceived
that
muskegon
capitol
was
a
frequent
and
a
welcome
ground
of
talk
i
drew
him
all
the
plans
from
memory
and
he
with
the
aid
of
a
narrow
volume
full
of
figures
and
tables
which
answered
i
believe
to
the
name
of
molesworth
and
was
his
constant
pocket
companion
would
draw
up
rough
estimates
and
make
imaginary
offers
on
the
various
contracts
our
muskegon
builders
he
pronounced
a
pack
of
cormorants
and
the
congenial
subject
together
with
my
knowledge
of
architectural
terms
the
theory
of
strains
and
the
prices
of
materials
in
the
states
formed
a
strong
bond
of
union
between
what
might
have
been
otherwise
an
pair
and
led
my
grandfather
to
pronounce
me
with
emphasis
real
intalligent
kind
of
a
thus
a
second
time
as
you
will
presently
see
the
capitol
of
my
native
state
had
influentially
affected
the
current
of
my
life
i
left
edinburgh
however
with
not
the
least
idea
that
i
had
done
a
stroke
of
excellent
business
for
myself
and
singly
delighted
to
escape
out
of
a
somewhat
dreary
house
and
plunge
instead
into
the
rainbow
city
of
paris
every
man
has
his
own
romance
mine
clustered
exclusively
about
the
practice
of
the
arts
the
life
of
latin
quarter
students
and
the
world
of
paris
as
depicted
by
that
grimy
wizard
the
author
of
the
i
was
not
disappointed
i
could
not
have
been
for
i
did
not
see
the
facts
i
brought
them
with
me
marcas
lived
next
door
to
me
in
my
ungainly
hotel
of
the
rue
racine
i
dined
at
my
villainous
restaurant
with
lousteau
and
with
rastignac
if
a
curricle
nearly
ran
me
down
at
a
maxime
de
trailles
would
be
the
driver
i
dined
i
say
at
a
poor
restaurant
and
lived
in
a
poor
hotel
and
this
was
not
from
need
but
sentiment
my
father
gave
me
a
profuse
allowance
and
i
might
have
lived
had
i
chosen
in
the
quartier
de
and
driven
to
my
studies
daily
had
i
done
so
the
glamour
must
have
fled
i
should
still
have
been
but
loudon
dodd
whereas
now
i
was
a
latin
quarter
student
successor
living
in
flesh
and
blood
the
life
of
one
of
those
romances
i
had
loved
to
read
to
and
to
dream
over
among
the
woods
of
muskegon
at
this
time
we
were
all
a
little
in
the
latin
quarter
the
play
of
the
de
a
dreary
snivelling
piece
had
been
produced
at
the
odeon
had
run
an
unconscionable
time
for
paris
and
revived
the
freshness
of
the
legend
the
same
business
you
may
say
or
there
and
thereabout
was
being
privately
enacted
in
consequence
in
every
garret
of
the
neighbourhood
and
a
good
third
of
the
students
were
consciously
impersonating
rodolphe
or
schaunard
to
their
own
incommunicable
satisfaction
some
of
us
went
far
and
some
farther
i
always
looked
with
awful
envy
for
instance
on
a
certain
countryman
of
my
own
who
had
a
studio
in
the
rue
monsieur
le
prince
wore
boots
and
long
hair
in
a
net
and
could
be
seen
tramping
off
in
this
guise
to
the
worst
of
the
quarter
followed
by
a
corsican
model
his
mistress
in
the
conspicuous
costume
of
her
race
and
calling
it
takes
some
greatness
of
soul
to
carry
even
folly
to
such
heights
as
these
and
for
my
own
part
i
had
to
content
myself
by
pretending
very
arduously
to
be
poor
by
wearing
a
on
the
streets
and
by
pursuing
through
a
series
of
misadventures
that
extinct
mammal
the
grisette
the
most
grievous
part
was
the
eating
and
the
drinking
i
was
born
with
a
dainty
tooth
and
a
palate
for
wine
and
only
a
genuine
devotion
to
romance
could
have
supported
me
under
the
that
i
had
to
swallow
and
the
red
ink
of
bercy
i
must
wash
them
down
withal
every
now
and
again
after
a
hard
day
at
the
studio
where
i
was
steadily
and
far
from
unsuccessfully
industrious
a
wave
of
distaste
would
overbear
me
i
would
slink
away
from
my
haunts
and
companions
indemnify
myself
for
weeks
of
with
fine
wines
and
dainty
dishes
seated
perhaps
on
a
terrace
perhaps
in
an
arbour
in
a
garden
with
a
volume
of
one
of
my
favourite
authors
propped
open
in
front
of
me
and
now
consulted
awhile
and
now
forgotten
so
remain
relishing
my
situation
till
night
fell
and
the
lights
of
the
city
kindled
and
thence
stroll
homeward
by
the
riverside
under
the
moon
or
stars
in
a
heaven
of
poetry
and
digestion
one
such
indulgence
led
me
in
the
course
of
my
second
year
into
an
adventure
which
i
must
relate
indeed
it
is
the
very
point
i
have
been
aiming
for
since
that
was
what
brought
me
in
acquaintance
with
jim
pinkerton
i
sat
down
alone
to
dinner
one
october
day
when
the
rusty
leaves
were
falling
and
scuttling
on
the
boulevard
and
the
minds
of
impressionable
men
inclined
in
about
an
equal
degree
towards
sadness
and
conviviality
the
restaurant
was
no
great
place
but
boasted
a
considerable
cellar
and
a
long
printed
list
of
vintages
this
i
was
perusing
with
the
double
zest
of
a
man
who
is
fond
of
wine
and
a
lover
of
beautiful
names
when
my
eye
fell
near
the
end
of
the
card
on
that
not
very
famous
or
familiar
brand
roussillon
i
remembered
it
was
a
wine
i
had
never
tasted
ordered
a
bottle
found
it
excellent
and
when
i
had
discussed
the
contents
called
according
to
my
habit
for
a
final
pint
it
appears
they
did
not
keep
roussillon
in
right
said
i
the
tables
at
this
are
close
together
and
the
next
thing
i
can
remember
i
was
in
somewhat
loud
conversation
with
my
nearest
neighbours
from
these
i
must
have
gradually
extended
my
attentions
for
i
have
a
clear
recollection
of
gazing
about
a
room
in
which
every
chair
was
half
turned
round
and
every
face
turned
smilingly
to
mine
i
can
even
remember
what
i
was
saying
at
the
moment
but
after
twenty
years
the
embers
of
shame
are
still
alive
and
i
prefer
to
give
your
imagination
the
cue
by
simply
mentioning
that
my
muse
was
the
patriotic
it
had
been
my
design
to
adjourn
for
coffee
in
the
company
of
some
of
these
new
friends
but
i
was
no
sooner
on
the
sidewalk
than
i
found
myself
unaccountably
alone
the
circumstance
scarce
surprised
me
at
the
time
much
less
now
but
i
was
somewhat
chagrined
a
little
after
to
find
i
had
walked
into
a
kiosque
i
began
to
wonder
if
i
were
any
the
worse
for
my
last
bottle
and
decided
to
steady
myself
with
coffee
and
brandy
in
the
cafe
de
la
source
where
i
went
for
this
restorative
the
fountain
was
playing
and
what
greatly
surprised
me
the
mill
and
the
various
mechanical
figures
on
the
rockery
appeared
to
have
been
freshly
repaired
and
performed
the
most
enchanting
antics
the
cafe
was
extraordinarily
hot
and
bright
with
every
detail
of
a
conspicuous
clearness
from
the
faces
of
the
guests
to
the
type
of
the
newspapers
on
the
tables
and
the
whole
apartment
swang
to
and
fro
like
a
hammock
with
an
exhilarating
motion
for
some
while
i
was
so
extremely
pleased
with
these
particulars
that
i
thought
i
could
never
be
weary
of
beholding
them
then
dropped
of
a
sudden
into
a
causeless
sadness
and
then
with
the
same
swiftness
and
spontaneity
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
i
was
drunk
and
had
better
get
to
bed
it
was
but
a
step
or
two
to
my
hotel
where
i
got
my
lighted
candle
from
the
porter
and
mounted
the
four
flights
to
my
own
room
although
i
could
not
deny
that
i
was
drunk
i
was
at
the
same
time
lucidly
rational
and
practical
i
had
but
one
preoccupation
to
be
up
in
time
on
the
morrow
for
my
work
and
when
i
observed
the
clock
on
my
to
have
stopped
i
decided
to
go
down
stairs
again
and
give
directions
to
the
porter
leaving
the
candle
burning
and
my
door
open
to
be
a
guide
to
me
on
my
return
i
set
forth
accordingly
the
house
was
quite
dark
but
as
there
were
only
the
three
doors
on
each
landing
it
was
impossible
to
wander
and
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
descend
the
stairs
until
i
saw
the
glimmer
of
the
porter
night
light
i
counted
four
flights
no
porter
it
was
possible
of
course
that
i
had
reckoned
incorrectly
so
i
went
down
another
and
another
and
another
still
counting
as
i
went
until
i
had
reached
the
preposterous
figure
of
nine
flights
it
was
now
quite
clear
that
i
had
somehow
passed
the
porter
lodge
without
remarking
it
indeed
i
was
at
the
lowest
figure
five
pairs
of
stairs
below
the
street
and
plunged
in
the
very
bowels
of
the
earth
that
my
hotel
should
thus
be
founded
upon
catacombs
was
a
discovery
of
considerable
interest
and
if
i
had
not
been
in
a
frame
of
mind
entirely
businesslike
i
might
have
continued
to
explore
all
night
this
subterranean
empire
but
i
was
bound
i
must
be
up
betimes
on
the
next
morning
and
for
that
end
it
was
imperative
that
i
should
find
the
porter
i
faced
about
accordingly
and
counting
with
painful
care
remounted
towards
the
level
of
the
street
five
six
and
seven
flights
i
climbed
and
still
there
was
no
porter
i
began
to
be
weary
of
the
job
and
reflecting
that
i
was
now
close
to
my
own
room
decided
i
should
go
to
bed
eight
nine
ten
eleven
twelve
thirteen
flights
i
mounted
and
my
open
door
seemed
to
be
as
wholly
lost
to
me
as
the
porter
and
his
floating
dip
i
remembered
that
the
house
stood
but
six
stories
at
its
highest
point
from
which
it
appeared
on
the
most
moderate
computation
i
was
now
three
stories
higher
than
the
roof
my
original
sense
of
amusement
was
succeeded
by
a
not
unnatural
irritation
room
has
just
got
to
be
here
said
i
and
i
stepped
towards
the
door
with
outspread
arms
there
was
no
door
and
no
wall
in
place
of
either
there
yawned
before
me
a
dark
corridor
in
which
i
continued
to
advance
for
some
time
without
encountering
the
smallest
opposition
and
this
in
a
house
whose
extreme
area
scantily
contained
three
small
rooms
a
narrow
landing
and
the
stair
the
thing
was
manifestly
nonsense
and
you
will
scarcely
be
surprised
to
learn
that
i
now
began
to
lose
my
temper
at
this
juncture
i
perceived
a
filtering
of
light
along
the
floor
stretched
forth
my
hand
which
encountered
the
knob
of
a
and
without
further
ceremony
entered
a
room
a
young
lady
was
within
she
was
going
to
bed
and
her
toilet
was
far
advanced
or
the
other
way
about
if
you
prefer
hope
you
will
pardon
this
intrusion
said
i
my
room
is
no
and
something
has
gone
wrong
with
this
blamed
she
looked
at
me
a
moment
and
then
you
will
step
outside
for
a
moment
i
will
take
you
there
says
she
thus
with
perfect
composure
on
both
sides
the
matter
was
arranged
i
waited
a
while
outside
her
door
presently
she
rejoined
me
in
a
took
my
hand
led
me
up
another
flight
which
made
the
fourth
above
the
level
of
the
roof
and
shut
me
into
my
own
room
where
being
quite
weary
after
these
contraordinary
explorations
i
turned
in
and
slumbered
like
a
child
i
tell
you
the
thing
calmly
as
it
appeared
to
me
to
pass
but
the
next
day
when
i
awoke
and
put
memory
in
the
i
could
not
conceal
from
myself
that
the
tale
presented
a
good
many
improbable
features
i
had
no
mind
for
the
studio
after
all
and
went
instead
to
the
luxembourg
gardens
there
among
the
sparrows
and
the
statues
and
the
falling
leaves
to
cool
and
clear
my
head
it
is
a
garden
i
have
always
loved
you
sit
there
in
a
public
place
of
history
and
fiction
barras
and
fouche
have
looked
from
these
windows
lousteau
and
de
banville
one
as
real
as
the
other
have
rhymed
upon
these
benches
the
city
tramples
by
without
the
railings
to
a
lively
measure
and
within
and
about
you
trees
rustle
children
and
sparrows
utter
their
small
cries
and
the
statues
look
on
forever
here
then
in
a
seat
opposite
the
gallery
entrance
i
set
to
work
on
the
events
of
the
last
night
to
disengage
if
it
were
possible
truth
from
fiction
the
house
by
daylight
had
proved
to
be
six
stories
high
the
same
as
ever
i
could
find
with
all
my
architectural
experience
no
room
in
its
altitude
for
those
interminable
stairways
no
width
between
its
walls
for
that
long
corridor
where
i
had
tramped
at
night
and
there
was
yet
a
greater
difficulty
i
had
read
somewhere
an
aphorism
that
everything
may
be
false
to
itself
save
human
nature
a
house
might
elongate
or
enlarge
itself
or
seem
to
do
so
to
a
gentleman
who
had
been
dining
the
ocean
might
dry
up
the
rocks
melt
in
the
sun
the
stars
fall
from
heaven
like
autumn
apples
and
there
was
nothing
in
these
incidents
to
boggle
the
philosopher
but
the
case
of
the
young
lady
stood
upon
a
different
foundation
girls
were
not
good
enough
or
not
good
that
way
or
else
they
were
too
good
i
was
ready
to
accept
any
of
these
views
all
pointed
to
the
same
conclusion
which
i
was
thus
already
on
the
point
of
reaching
when
a
fresh
argument
occurred
and
instantly
confirmed
it
i
could
remember
the
exact
words
we
had
each
said
and
i
had
spoken
and
she
had
replied
in
english
plainly
then
the
whole
affair
was
an
illusion
catacombs
and
stairs
and
charitable
lady
all
were
equally
the
stuff
of
dreams
i
had
just
come
to
this
determination
when
there
blew
a
flaw
of
wind
through
the
autumnal
gardens
the
dead
leaves
showered
down
and
a
flight
of
sparrows
thick
as
a
snowfall
wheeled
above
my
head
with
sudden
pipings
this
agreeable
bustle
was
the
affair
of
a
moment
but
it
startled
me
from
the
abstraction
into
which
i
had
fallen
like
a
summons
i
sat
briskly
up
and
as
i
did
so
my
eyes
rested
on
the
figure
of
a
lady
in
a
brown
jacket
and
carrying
a
by
her
side
walked
a
fellow
some
years
older
than
myself
with
an
easel
under
his
arm
and
alike
by
their
course
and
cargo
i
might
judge
they
were
bound
for
the
gallery
where
the
lady
was
doubtless
engaged
upon
some
copying
you
can
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
recognized
in
her
the
heroine
of
my
adventure
to
put
the
matter
beyond
question
our
eyes
met
and
she
seeing
herself
remembered
and
recalling
the
trim
in
which
i
had
last
beheld
her
looked
swiftly
on
the
ground
with
just
a
shadow
of
confusion
i
could
not
tell
you
if
she
were
plain
or
pretty
but
she
had
behaved
with
so
much
good
sense
and
i
had
cut
so
poor
a
figure
in
her
presence
that
i
became
instantly
fired
with
the
desire
to
display
myself
in
a
more
favorable
light
the
young
man
besides
was
possibly
her
brother
brothers
are
apt
to
be
hasty
theirs
being
a
part
in
which
it
is
possible
at
a
comparatively
early
age
to
assume
the
dignity
of
manhood
and
it
occurred
to
me
it
might
be
wise
to
forestall
all
possible
complications
by
an
apology
on
this
reasoning
i
drew
near
to
the
gallery
door
and
had
hardly
got
in
position
before
the
young
man
came
out
thus
it
was
that
i
came
face
to
face
with
my
third
destiny
for
my
career
has
been
entirely
shaped
by
these
three
elements
my
father
the
capitol
of
muskegon
and
my
friend
jim
pinkerton
as
for
the
young
lady
with
whom
my
mind
was
at
the
moment
chiefly
occupied
i
was
never
to
hear
more
of
her
from
that
day
forward
an
excellent
example
of
the
blind
man
buff
that
we
call
life
chapter
iii
to
introduce
pinkerton
the
stranger
i
have
said
was
some
years
older
than
myself
a
man
of
a
good
stature
a
very
lively
face
cordial
agitated
manners
and
a
gray
eye
as
active
as
a
fowl
i
have
a
word
with
you
said
i
dear
sir
he
replied
do
know
what
it
can
be
about
but
you
may
have
a
hundred
if
you
have
just
left
the
side
of
a
young
lady
i
continued
whom
i
was
led
very
unintentionally
into
the
appearance
of
an
offence
to
speak
to
herself
would
be
only
to
renew
her
embarrassment
and
i
seize
the
occasion
of
making
my
apology
and
declaring
my
respect
to
one
of
my
own
sex
who
is
her
friend
and
perhaps
i
added
with
a
bow
natural
are
a
countryman
of
mine
i
know
it
he
cried
am
sure
of
it
by
your
delicacy
to
a
lady
you
do
her
no
more
than
justice
i
was
introduced
to
her
the
other
night
at
tea
in
the
apartment
of
some
people
friends
of
mine
and
meeting
her
again
this
morning
i
could
not
do
less
than
carry
her
easel
for
her
my
dear
sir
what
is
your
name
i
was
disappointed
to
find
he
had
so
little
bond
with
my
young
lady
and
but
that
it
was
i
who
had
sought
the
acquaintance
might
have
been
tempted
to
retreat
at
the
same
time
something
in
the
stranger
eye
engaged
me
name
said
i
loudon
dodd
i
am
a
student
of
sculpture
here
from
sculpture
he
cried
as
though
that
would
have
been
his
last
conjecture
is
james
pinkerton
i
am
delighted
to
have
the
pleasure
of
your
it
was
now
my
turn
to
exclaim
you
pinkerton
he
admitted
his
identity
with
a
laugh
of
boyish
delight
and
indeed
any
young
man
in
the
quarter
might
have
been
proud
to
own
a
sobriquet
thus
gallantly
acquired
in
order
to
explain
the
name
i
must
here
digress
into
a
chapter
of
the
history
of
manners
in
the
nineteenth
century
very
well
worth
commemoration
for
its
own
sake
in
some
of
the
studios
at
that
date
the
hazing
of
new
pupils
was
both
barbarous
and
obscene
two
incidents
following
one
on
the
heels
of
the
other
tended
to
produce
an
advance
in
civilization
by
the
means
as
so
commonly
happens
of
a
passing
appeal
to
savage
standards
the
first
was
the
arrival
of
a
little
gentleman
from
armenia
he
had
a
fez
upon
his
head
and
what
nobody
counted
on
a
dagger
in
his
pocket
the
hazing
was
set
about
in
the
customary
style
and
perhaps
in
virtue
of
the
victim
even
more
boisterously
than
usual
he
bore
it
at
first
with
an
inviting
patience
but
upon
one
of
the
students
proceeding
to
an
unpardonable
freedom
plucked
out
his
knife
and
suddenly
plunged
it
in
the
belly
of
the
jester
this
gentleman
i
am
pleased
to
say
passed
months
upon
a
bed
of
sickness
before
he
was
in
a
position
to
resume
his
studies
the
second
incident
was
that
which
had
earned
pinkerton
his
reputation
in
a
crowded
studio
while
some
very
filthy
brutalities
were
being
practised
on
a
trembling
debutant
a
tall
pale
fellow
sprang
from
his
stool
and
without
the
smallest
preface
or
explanation
sang
out
english
and
americans
to
clear
the
shop
our
race
is
brutal
but
not
filthy
and
the
summons
was
nobly
responded
to
every
student
seized
his
stool
in
a
moment
the
studio
was
full
of
bloody
coxcombs
the
french
fleeing
in
disorder
for
the
door
the
victim
liberated
and
amazed
in
this
feat
of
arms
both
nations
covered
themselves
with
glory
but
i
am
proud
to
claim
the
author
of
the
whole
for
an
american
and
a
patriotic
american
at
that
being
the
same
gentleman
who
had
subsequently
to
be
held
down
in
the
bottom
of
a
box
during
a
performance
of
sobbing
at
intervals
country
o
my
country
while
yet
another
my
new
acquaintance
pinkerton
was
supposed
to
have
made
the
most
conspicuous
figure
in
the
actual
battle
at
one
blow
he
had
broken
his
own
stool
and
sent
the
largest
of
his
opponents
back
foremost
through
what
we
used
to
call
a
it
appears
that
in
the
continuation
of
his
flight
this
fallen
warrior
issued
on
the
boulevard
still
framed
in
the
burst
canvas
it
will
be
understood
how
much
talk
the
incident
aroused
in
the
students
quarter
and
that
i
was
highly
gratified
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
my
famous
countryman
it
chanced
i
was
to
see
more
of
the
quixotic
side
of
his
character
before
the
morning
was
done
for
as
we
continued
to
stroll
together
i
found
myself
near
the
studio
of
a
young
frenchman
whose
work
i
had
promised
to
examine
and
in
the
fashion
of
the
quarter
carried
up
pinkerton
along
with
me
some
of
my
comrades
of
this
date
were
pretty
obnoxious
fellows
i
could
almost
always
admire
and
respect
the
practitioners
of
art
in
paris
but
many
of
those
who
were
still
in
a
state
of
pupilage
were
sorry
specimens
so
much
so
that
i
used
often
to
wonder
where
the
painters
came
from
and
where
the
brutes
of
students
went
to
a
similar
mystery
hangs
over
the
intermediate
stages
of
the
medical
profession
and
must
have
perplexed
the
least
observant
the
ruffian
at
least
whom
i
now
carried
pinkerton
to
visit
was
one
of
the
most
crapulous
in
the
quarter
he
turned
out
for
our
delectation
a
huge
as
we
used
to
call
it
of
stephen
wallowing
in
red
upon
his
belly
in
an
exhausted
receiver
and
a
crowd
of
hebrews
in
blue
green
and
yellow
pelting
him
apparently
with
buns
and
while
we
gazed
upon
this
contrivance
regaled
us
with
a
piece
of
his
own
recent
biography
of
which
his
mind
was
still
very
full
and
which
he
seemed
to
fancy
represented
him
in
a
heroic
posture
i
was
one
of
those
cosmopolitan
americans
who
accept
the
world
whether
at
home
or
abroad
as
they
find
it
and
whose
favourite
part
is
that
of
the
spectator
yet
even
i
was
listening
with
disgust
when
i
was
aware
of
a
violent
plucking
at
my
sleeve
he
saying
he
kicked
her
down
stairs
asked
pinkerton
white
as
stephen
said
i
discarded
mistress
and
then
he
pelted
her
with
stones
i
suppose
that
what
gave
him
the
idea
for
his
picture
he
has
just
been
alleging
the
pathetic
excuse
that
she
was
old
enough
to
be
his
something
like
a
sob
broke
from
pinkerton
him
he
gasped
ca
speak
this
language
though
i
understand
a
little
i
never
had
any
proper
education
tell
him
i
going
to
punch
his
god
sake
do
nothing
of
the
sort
i
cried
understand
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
tried
to
bundle
him
out
him
first
what
we
think
of
him
he
objected
me
tell
him
what
he
looks
in
the
eyes
of
a
that
to
me
said
i
thrusting
pinkerton
clear
through
the
door
a
inquired
the
student
the
matter
with
him
se
sent
mal
au
coeur
trop
regarde
votre
croute
said
i
and
made
my
escape
scarce
with
dignity
at
pinkerton
heels
gentleman
is
sick
at
his
stomach
from
having
looked
too
long
at
your
did
you
say
to
him
he
asked
only
thing
that
he
could
feel
was
my
reply
after
this
scene
the
freedom
with
which
i
had
ejected
my
new
acquaintance
and
the
precipitation
with
which
i
had
followed
him
the
least
i
could
do
was
to
propose
luncheon
i
have
forgot
the
name
of
the
place
to
which
i
led
him
nothing
loath
it
was
on
the
far
side
of
the
luxembourg
at
least
with
a
garden
behind
where
we
were
speedily
set
face
to
face
at
table
and
began
to
dig
into
each
other
history
and
character
like
terriers
after
rabbits
according
to
the
approved
fashion
of
youth
pinkerton
parents
were
from
the
old
country
there
too
i
incidentally
gathered
he
had
himself
been
born
though
it
was
a
circumstance
he
seemed
prone
to
forget
whether
he
had
run
away
or
his
father
had
turned
him
out
i
never
fathomed
but
about
the
age
of
twelve
he
was
thrown
upon
his
own
resources
a
travelling
photographer
picked
him
up
like
a
haw
out
of
a
hedgerow
on
a
wayside
in
new
jersey
took
a
fancy
to
the
urchin
carried
him
on
with
him
in
his
wandering
life
taught
him
all
he
knew
himself
to
take
as
well
as
i
can
make
out
and
doubt
the
scriptures
and
died
at
last
in
ohio
at
the
corner
of
a
road
was
a
grand
specimen
cried
pinkerton
wish
you
could
have
seen
him
dodd
he
had
an
appearance
of
magnanimity
that
used
to
remind
me
of
the
on
the
death
of
this
random
protector
the
boy
inherited
the
plant
and
continued
the
business
was
a
life
i
could
have
chosen
dodd
he
cried
have
been
in
all
the
finest
scenes
of
that
magnificent
continent
that
we
were
born
to
be
the
heirs
of
i
wish
you
could
see
my
collection
of
i
wish
i
had
them
here
they
were
taken
for
my
own
pleasure
and
to
be
a
memento
and
they
show
nature
in
her
grandest
as
well
as
her
gentlest
as
he
tramped
the
western
states
and
territories
taking
the
boy
was
continually
getting
hold
of
books
good
bad
and
indifferent
popular
and
abstruse
from
the
novels
of
sylvanus
cobb
to
elements
both
of
which
i
found
to
my
almost
equal
wonder
he
had
managed
to
peruse
he
was
taking
stock
by
the
way
of
the
people
the
products
and
the
country
with
an
eye
unusually
observant
and
a
memory
unusually
retentive
and
he
was
collecting
for
himself
a
body
of
magnanimous
and
nonsense
which
he
supposed
to
be
the
natural
thoughts
and
to
contain
the
whole
duty
of
the
born
american
to
be
to
be
patriotic
to
get
culture
and
money
with
both
hands
and
with
the
same
irrational
fervour
these
appeared
to
be
the
chief
articles
of
his
creed
in
later
days
not
of
course
upon
this
first
occasion
i
would
sometimes
ask
him
why
and
he
had
his
answer
pat
build
up
the
type
he
would
cry
all
committed
to
that
we
all
under
bond
to
fulfil
the
american
type
loudon
the
hope
of
the
world
is
there
if
we
fail
like
these
old
feudal
monarchies
what
is
left
the
trade
of
a
proved
too
narrow
for
the
lad
ambition
it
was
insusceptible
of
expansion
he
explained
it
was
not
truly
modern
and
by
a
sudden
conversion
of
front
he
became
a
the
principles
of
this
trade
i
never
clearly
understood
but
its
essence
appears
to
be
to
cheat
the
railroads
out
of
their
due
fare
threw
my
whole
soul
into
it
i
grudged
myself
food
and
sleep
while
i
was
at
it
the
most
practised
hands
admitted
i
had
caught
on
to
the
idea
in
a
month
and
revolutionised
the
practice
inside
of
a
year
he
said
interest
in
it
too
it
amusing
to
pick
out
some
one
going
by
make
up
your
mind
about
his
character
and
tastes
dash
out
of
the
office
and
hit
him
flying
with
an
offer
of
the
very
place
he
wants
to
go
to
i
think
there
was
a
scalper
on
the
continent
made
fewer
blunders
but
i
took
it
only
as
a
stage
i
was
saving
every
dollar
i
was
looking
ahead
i
knew
what
i
wanted
wealth
education
a
refined
home
and
a
conscientious
cultured
lady
for
a
wife
for
this
with
a
formidable
outcry
man
is
bound
to
marry
above
him
if
the
woman
not
the
man
superior
i
brand
it
as
mere
sensuality
there
was
my
idea
at
least
that
was
what
i
was
saving
for
and
enough
too
but
it
is
every
man
i
know
that
it
far
from
every
man
could
do
what
i
did
close
up
the
livest
agency
in
saint
jo
where
he
was
coining
dollars
by
the
pot
set
out
alone
without
a
friend
or
a
word
of
french
and
settle
down
here
to
spend
his
capital
learning
it
an
old
taste
i
asked
him
a
sudden
fancy
dodd
he
admitted
course
i
had
learned
in
my
excursions
to
glory
and
exult
in
the
works
of
god
but
it
was
that
i
just
said
to
myself
what
is
most
wanted
in
my
age
and
country
more
culture
and
more
art
i
said
and
i
chose
the
best
place
saved
my
money
and
came
here
to
get
the
whole
attitude
of
this
young
man
warmed
and
shamed
me
he
had
more
fire
in
his
little
toe
than
i
had
in
my
whole
carcase
he
was
stuffed
to
bursting
with
the
manly
virtues
thrift
and
courage
glowed
in
him
and
even
if
his
artistic
vocation
seemed
to
one
of
my
exclusive
tenets
not
quite
clear
who
could
predict
what
might
be
accomplished
by
a
creature
so
and
so
inspired
with
animal
and
intellectual
energy
so
when
he
proposed
that
i
should
come
and
see
his
work
one
of
the
regular
stages
of
a
latin
quarter
friendship
i
followed
him
with
interest
and
hope
he
lodged
parsimoniously
at
the
top
of
a
tall
house
near
the
observatory
in
a
bare
room
principally
furnished
with
his
own
trunks
and
papered
with
his
own
despicable
studies
no
man
has
less
taste
for
disagreeable
duties
than
myself
perhaps
there
is
only
one
subject
on
which
i
can
not
flatter
a
man
without
a
blush
but
upon
that
upon
all
that
touches
art
my
sincerity
is
roman
once
and
twice
i
made
the
circuit
of
his
walls
in
silence
spying
in
every
corner
for
some
spark
of
merit
he
meanwhile
following
close
at
my
heels
reading
the
verdict
in
my
face
with
furtive
glances
presenting
some
fresh
study
for
my
inspection
with
undisguised
anxiety
and
after
it
had
been
silently
weighed
in
the
balances
and
found
wanting
whisking
it
away
with
an
open
gesture
of
despair
by
the
time
the
second
round
was
completed
we
were
both
extremely
depressed
he
groaned
breaking
the
long
silence
quite
unnecessary
you
should
speak
you
want
me
to
be
frank
with
you
i
think
you
are
wasting
time
said
i
do
see
any
promise
he
inquired
beguiled
by
some
return
of
hope
and
turning
upon
me
the
embarrassing
brightness
of
his
eye
in
this
here
of
the
melon
one
fellow
thought
it
it
was
the
least
i
could
do
to
give
the
melon
a
more
particular
examination
which
when
i
had
done
i
could
but
shake
my
head
am
truly
sorry
pinkerton
said
i
i
ca
advise
you
to
he
seemed
to
recover
his
fortitude
at
the
moment
rebounding
from
disappointment
like
a
man
of
said
he
stoutly
do
know
that
i
surprised
but
i
go
on
with
the
course
and
throw
my
whole
soul
into
it
too
you
must
think
the
time
is
lost
it
all
culture
it
will
help
me
to
extend
my
relations
when
i
get
back
home
it
may
fit
me
for
a
position
on
one
of
the
illustrateds
and
then
i
can
always
turn
dealer
he
said
uttering
the
monstrous
proposition
which
was
enough
to
shake
the
latin
quarter
to
the
dust
with
entire
simplicity
all
experience
besides
he
continued
it
seems
to
me
there
a
tendency
to
underrate
experience
both
as
net
profit
and
investment
never
mind
that
done
with
but
it
took
courage
for
you
to
say
what
you
did
and
i
never
forget
it
here
my
hand
dodd
i
not
your
equal
in
culture
or
talent
know
nothing
about
that
i
interrupted
have
seen
your
work
but
you
have
seen
mine
more
i
have
he
cried
let
go
see
it
at
once
but
i
know
you
are
away
up
i
can
feel
it
to
say
truth
i
was
almost
ashamed
to
introduce
him
to
my
studio
my
work
whether
absolutely
good
or
bad
being
so
vastly
superior
to
his
but
his
spirits
were
now
quite
restored
and
he
amazed
me
on
the
way
with
his
talk
and
new
projects
so
that
i
began
at
last
to
understand
how
matters
lay
that
this
was
not
an
artist
who
had
been
deprived
of
the
practice
of
his
single
art
but
only
a
business
man
of
very
extended
interests
informed
perhaps
something
of
the
most
suddenly
that
one
investment
out
of
twenty
had
gone
wrong
as
a
matter
of
fact
besides
although
i
never
suspected
it
he
was
already
seeking
consolation
with
another
of
the
muses
and
pleasing
himself
with
the
notion
that
he
would
repay
me
for
my
sincerity
cement
our
friendship
and
at
one
and
the
same
blow
restore
my
estimation
of
his
talents
several
times
already
when
i
had
been
speaking
of
myself
he
had
pulled
out
a
and
scribbled
a
brief
note
and
now
when
we
entered
the
studio
i
saw
it
in
his
hand
again
and
the
pencil
go
to
his
mouth
as
he
cast
a
comprehensive
glance
round
the
uncomfortable
building
you
going
to
make
a
sketch
of
it
i
could
not
help
asking
as
i
unveiled
the
genius
of
muskegon
that
my
secret
said
he
you
mind
a
mouse
can
help
a
he
walked
round
my
statue
and
had
the
design
explained
to
him
i
had
represented
muskegon
as
a
young
almost
a
stripling
mother
with
something
of
an
indian
type
the
babe
upon
her
knees
was
winged
to
indicate
our
soaring
future
and
her
seat
was
a
medley
of
sculptured
fragments
greek
roman
and
gothic
to
remind
us
of
the
older
worlds
from
which
we
trace
our
generation
does
this
satisfy
you
dodd
he
inquired
as
soon
as
i
had
explained
to
him
the
main
features
of
the
design
i
said
fellows
seem
to
think
it
not
a
bad
bonne
femme
for
a
beginner
i
do
think
it
entirely
bad
myself
here
is
the
best
point
it
builds
up
best
from
here
no
it
seems
to
me
it
has
a
kind
of
merit
i
admitted
i
mean
to
do
that
the
word
cried
pinkerton
the
word
i
love
and
he
scribbled
in
his
pad
in
creation
ails
you
i
inquired
the
most
commonplace
expression
in
the
english
and
better
chuckled
pinkerton
unconsciousness
of
genius
lord
but
this
is
coming
in
beautiful
and
he
scribbled
again
you
going
to
be
fulsome
said
i
close
the
place
of
and
i
threatened
to
replace
the
veil
upon
the
genius
no
said
he
be
in
a
hurry
give
me
a
point
or
two
show
me
what
particularly
would
rather
you
found
that
out
for
yourself
said
i
trouble
is
said
he
i
never
turned
my
attention
to
sculpture
beyond
of
course
admiring
it
as
everybody
must
who
has
a
soul
so
do
just
be
a
good
fellow
and
explain
to
me
what
you
like
in
it
and
what
you
tried
for
and
where
the
merit
comes
in
it
be
all
education
for
in
sculpture
you
see
the
first
thing
you
have
to
consider
is
the
masses
it
after
all
a
kind
of
architecture
i
began
and
delivered
a
lecture
on
that
branch
of
art
with
illustrations
from
my
own
masterpiece
there
present
all
of
which
if
you
do
mind
or
whether
you
mind
or
not
i
mean
to
conscientiously
omit
pinkerton
listened
with
a
fiery
interest
questioned
me
with
a
certain
uncultivated
shrewdness
and
continued
to
scratch
down
notes
and
tear
fresh
sheets
from
his
pad
i
found
it
inspiring
to
have
my
words
thus
taken
down
like
a
professor
lecture
and
having
had
no
previous
experience
of
the
press
i
was
unaware
that
they
were
all
being
taken
down
wrong
for
the
same
reason
incredible
as
it
must
appear
in
an
american
i
never
entertained
the
least
suspicion
that
they
were
destined
to
be
dished
up
with
a
sauce
of
gossip
and
myself
my
person
and
my
works
of
art
butchered
to
make
a
holiday
for
the
readers
of
a
sunday
paper
night
had
fallen
over
the
genius
of
muskegon
before
the
issue
of
my
theoretic
eloquence
was
stayed
nor
did
i
separate
from
my
new
friend
without
an
appointment
for
the
morrow
i
was
indeed
greatly
taken
with
this
first
view
of
my
countryman
and
continued
on
further
acquaintance
to
be
interested
amused
and
attracted
by
him
in
about
equal
proportions
i
must
not
say
he
had
a
fault
not
only
because
my
mouth
is
sealed
by
gratitude
but
because
those
he
had
sprang
merely
from
his
education
and
you
could
see
he
had
cultivated
and
improved
them
like
virtues
for
all
that
i
can
never
deny
he
was
a
troublous
friend
to
me
and
the
trouble
began
early
it
may
have
been
a
fortnight
later
that
i
divined
the
secret
of
the
my
wretch
it
leaked
out
wrote
letters
for
a
paper
in
the
west
and
had
filled
a
part
of
one
of
them
with
descriptions
of
myself
i
pointed
out
to
him
that
he
had
no
right
to
do
so
without
asking
my
permission
this
is
just
what
i
hoped
he
exclaimed
thought
you
seem
to
catch
on
only
it
seemed
too
good
to
be
my
good
fellow
you
were
bound
to
warn
me
i
objected
know
it
generally
considered
etiquette
he
admitted
between
friends
and
when
it
was
only
with
a
view
of
serving
you
i
thought
it
would
matter
i
wanted
it
if
possible
to
come
on
you
as
a
surprise
i
wanted
you
just
to
waken
like
lord
byron
and
find
the
papers
full
of
you
you
must
admit
it
was
a
natural
thought
and
no
man
likes
to
boast
of
a
favour
heavens
and
earth
how
do
you
know
i
think
it
a
favour
i
cried
he
became
immediately
plunged
in
despair
think
it
a
liberty
said
he
see
that
i
would
rather
have
cut
off
my
hand
i
would
stop
it
now
only
it
too
late
it
published
by
now
and
i
wrote
it
with
so
much
pride
and
pleasure
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
how
to
console
him
i
daresay
it
all
right
said
i
know
you
meant
it
kindly
and
you
would
be
sure
to
do
it
in
good
you
may
swear
to
he
cried
a
pure
bright
a
number
paper
the
jo
the
idea
of
the
series
was
quite
my
own
i
interviewed
the
editor
put
it
to
him
straight
the
freshness
of
the
idea
took
him
and
i
walked
out
of
that
office
with
the
contract
in
my
pocket
and
did
my
first
paris
letter
that
evening
in
saint
jo
the
editor
did
no
more
than
glance
his
eye
down
the
headlines
the
man
for
us
said
i
was
certainly
far
from
reassured
by
this
sketch
of
the
class
of
literature
in
which
i
was
to
make
my
first
appearance
but
i
said
no
more
and
possessed
my
soul
in
patience
until
the
day
came
when
i
received
a
copy
of
a
newspaper
marked
in
the
corner
of
i
opened
it
with
sensible
shrinkings
and
there
wedged
between
an
account
of
a
and
a
skittish
article
upon
chiropody
think
of
chiropody
treated
with
a
leer
i
came
upon
a
column
and
a
half
in
which
myself
and
my
poor
statue
were
embalmed
like
the
editor
with
the
first
of
the
series
i
did
but
glance
my
eye
down
the
and
was
more
than
satisfied
another
of
pinkerton
spicy
chats
art
practitioners
in
paris
muskegon
columned
capitol
son
of
millionaire
dodd
patriot
and
artist
means
to
do
in
the
body
of
the
text
besides
my
eye
caught
as
it
passed
some
deadly
expressions
somewhat
fleshy
intellectual
smile
unconsciousness
of
genius
dodd
resumed
the
reporter
would
be
your
idea
of
a
distinctively
american
quality
in
sculpture
it
was
true
the
question
had
been
asked
it
was
true
alas
that
i
had
answered
and
now
here
was
my
reply
or
some
strange
hash
of
it
gibbeted
in
the
cold
publicity
of
type
i
thanked
god
that
my
french
were
ignorant
of
english
but
when
i
thought
of
the
british
of
myner
for
instance
or
the
stennises
i
think
i
could
have
fallen
on
pinkerton
and
beat
him
to
divert
my
thoughts
if
it
were
possible
from
this
calamity
i
turned
to
a
letter
from
my
father
which
had
arrived
by
the
same
post
the
envelope
contained
a
strip
of
and
my
eye
caught
again
of
millionaire
dodd
figure
somewhat
fleshy
and
the
rest
of
the
degrading
nonsense
what
would
my
father
think
of
it
i
wondered
and
opened
his
manuscript
dearest
boy
it
began
send
you
a
cutting
which
has
pleased
me
very
much
from
a
joseph
paper
of
high
standing
at
last
you
seem
to
be
coming
fairly
to
the
front
and
i
can
not
but
reflect
with
delight
and
gratitude
how
very
few
youths
of
your
age
occupy
nearly
two
columns
of
all
to
themselves
i
only
wish
your
dear
mother
had
been
here
to
read
it
over
my
shoulder
but
we
will
hope
she
shares
my
grateful
emotion
in
a
better
place
of
course
i
have
sent
a
copy
to
your
grandfather
and
uncle
in
edinburgh
so
you
can
keep
the
one
i
enclose
this
jim
pinkerton
seems
a
valuable
acquaintance
he
has
certainly
great
talent
and
it
is
a
good
general
rule
to
keep
in
with
i
hope
it
will
be
set
down
to
the
right
side
of
my
account
but
i
had
no
sooner
read
these
words
so
touchingly
silly
than
my
anger
against
pinkerton
was
swallowed
up
in
gratitude
of
all
the
circumstances
of
my
career
my
birth
perhaps
excepted
not
one
had
given
my
poor
father
so
profound
a
pleasure
as
this
article
in
the
what
a
fool
then
was
i
to
be
lamenting
when
i
had
at
last
and
for
once
and
at
the
cost
of
only
a
few
blushes
paid
back
a
fraction
of
my
debt
of
gratitude
so
that
when
i
next
met
pinkerton
i
took
things
very
lightly
my
father
was
pleased
and
thought
the
letter
very
clever
i
told
him
for
my
own
part
i
had
no
taste
for
publicity
thought
the
public
had
no
concern
with
the
artist
only
with
his
art
and
though
i
owned
he
had
handled
it
with
great
consideration
i
should
take
it
as
a
favour
if
he
never
did
it
again
it
is
he
said
despondingly
hurt
you
you
ca
deceive
me
loudon
it
the
want
of
tact
and
it
he
sat
down
and
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hand
had
no
advantages
when
i
was
young
you
see
he
added
in
the
least
my
dear
fellow
said
i
the
next
time
you
wish
to
do
me
a
service
just
speak
about
my
work
leave
my
wretched
person
out
and
my
still
more
wretched
conversation
and
above
all
i
added
with
an
irrepressible
shudder
tell
them
how
i
said
it
that
phrase
now
a
proud
glad
smile
who
cares
whether
i
smiled
or
not
there
now
loudon
you
entirely
wrong
he
broke
in
what
the
public
likes
that
the
merit
of
the
thing
the
literary
value
it
to
call
up
the
scene
before
them
it
to
enable
the
humblest
citizen
to
enjoy
that
afternoon
the
same
as
i
did
think
what
it
would
have
been
to
me
when
i
was
tramping
around
with
my
to
find
a
column
and
a
half
of
real
cultured
conversation
an
artist
in
his
studio
abroad
talking
of
his
art
and
to
know
how
he
looked
as
he
did
it
and
what
the
room
was
like
and
what
he
had
for
breakfast
and
to
tell
myself
eating
tinned
beans
beside
a
creek
that
if
all
went
well
the
same
sort
of
thing
would
sooner
or
later
happen
to
myself
why
loudon
it
would
have
been
like
a
peephole
into
heaven
if
it
gives
so
much
pleasure
i
admitted
sufferers
should
complain
only
give
the
other
fellows
a
the
end
of
the
matter
was
to
bring
myself
and
the
journalist
in
a
more
close
relation
if
i
know
anything
at
all
of
human
nature
and
the
if
is
no
mere
figure
of
speech
but
stands
for
honest
doubt
no
series
of
benefits
conferred
or
even
dangers
shared
would
have
so
rapidly
confirmed
our
friendship
as
this
quarrel
avoided
this
fundamental
difference
of
taste
and
training
accepted
and
condoned
chapter
iv
in
which
i
experience
extremes
of
fortune
whether
it
came
from
my
training
and
repeated
bankruptcy
at
the
commercial
college
or
by
direct
inheritance
from
old
loudon
the
edinburgh
mason
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
i
was
thrifty
looking
myself
impartially
over
i
believe
that
is
my
only
manly
virtue
during
my
first
two
years
in
paris
i
not
only
made
it
a
point
to
keep
well
inside
of
my
allowance
but
accumulated
considerable
savings
in
the
bank
you
will
say
with
my
masquerade
of
living
as
a
penniless
student
it
must
have
been
easy
to
do
so
i
should
have
had
no
difficulty
however
in
doing
the
reverse
indeed
it
is
wonderful
i
did
not
and
early
in
the
third
year
or
soon
after
i
had
known
pinkerton
a
singular
incident
proved
it
to
have
been
equally
wise
came
and
brought
no
allowance
a
letter
of
remonstrance
was
despatched
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
experience
remained
unanswered
a
cablegram
was
more
effectual
for
it
brought
me
at
least
a
promise
of
attention
write
at
once
my
father
telegraphed
but
i
waited
long
for
his
letter
i
was
puzzled
angry
and
alarmed
but
thanks
to
my
previous
thrift
i
can
not
say
that
i
was
ever
practically
embarrassed
the
embarrassment
the
distress
the
agony
were
all
for
my
unhappy
father
at
home
in
muskegon
struggling
for
life
and
fortune
against
untoward
chances
returning
at
night
from
a
day
of
shifts
and
ventures
to
read
and
perhaps
to
weep
over
that
last
harsh
letter
from
his
only
child
to
which
he
lacked
the
courage
to
reply
nearly
three
months
after
time
and
when
my
economies
were
beginning
to
run
low
i
received
at
last
a
letter
with
the
customary
bills
of
exchange
dearest
boy
it
ran
believe
in
the
press
of
anxious
business
your
letters
and
even
your
allowance
have
been
somewhile
neglected
you
must
try
to
forgive
your
poor
old
dad
for
he
has
had
a
trying
time
and
now
when
it
is
over
the
doctor
wants
me
to
take
my
shotgun
and
go
to
the
adirondacks
for
a
change
you
must
not
fancy
i
am
sick
only
and
under
the
weather
many
of
our
foremost
operators
have
gone
down
john
skipped
to
canada
with
a
trunkful
of
boodle
billy
sandwith
charlie
downs
joe
kaiser
and
many
others
of
our
leading
men
in
this
city
bit
the
dust
but
dodd
has
again
weathered
the
blizzard
and
i
think
i
have
fixed
things
so
that
we
may
be
richer
than
ever
before
autumn
i
will
tell
you
my
dear
what
i
propose
you
say
you
are
well
advanced
with
your
first
statue
start
in
manfully
and
finish
it
and
if
your
teacher
i
can
never
remember
how
to
spell
his
name
will
send
me
a
certificate
that
it
is
up
to
market
standard
you
shall
have
ten
thousand
dollars
to
do
what
you
like
with
either
at
home
or
in
paris
i
suggest
since
you
say
the
facilities
for
work
are
so
much
greater
in
that
city
you
would
do
well
to
buy
or
build
a
little
home
and
the
first
thing
you
know
your
dad
will
be
dropping
in
for
a
luncheon
indeed
i
would
come
now
for
i
am
beginning
to
grow
old
and
i
long
to
see
my
dear
boy
but
there
are
still
some
operations
that
want
watching
and
nursing
tell
your
friend
pinkerton
that
i
read
his
letters
every
week
and
though
i
have
looked
in
vain
lately
for
my
name
still
i
learn
something
of
the
life
he
is
leading
in
that
strange
old
world
depicted
by
an
able
here
was
a
letter
that
no
young
man
could
possibly
digest
in
solitude
it
marked
one
of
those
junctures
when
the
confidant
is
necessary
and
the
confidant
selected
was
none
other
than
jim
pinkerton
my
message
may
have
had
an
influence
in
this
decision
but
i
scarce
suppose
so
for
the
intimacy
was
already
far
advanced
i
had
a
genuine
and
lively
taste
for
my
compatriot
i
laughed
at
i
scolded
and
i
loved
him
he
upon
his
side
paid
me
a
kind
of
doglike
service
of
admiration
gazing
at
me
from
afar
off
as
at
one
who
had
liberally
enjoyed
those
which
he
envied
for
himself
he
followed
at
heel
his
laugh
was
ready
chorus
our
friends
gave
him
the
nickname
of
it
was
in
this
insidious
form
that
servitude
approached
me
pinkerton
and
i
read
and
the
famous
news
he
i
can
swear
with
an
enjoyment
as
unalloyed
and
far
more
vocal
than
my
own
the
statue
was
nearly
done
a
few
days
work
sufficed
to
prepare
it
for
exhibition
the
master
was
approached
he
gave
his
consent
and
one
cloudless
morning
of
may
beheld
us
gathered
in
my
studio
for
the
hour
of
trial
the
master
wore
his
rosette
he
came
attended
by
two
of
my
french
friends
of
mine
and
both
considerable
sculptors
in
paris
at
this
hour
as
we
used
to
call
him
breaking
for
once
those
habits
of
study
and
reserve
which
have
since
carried
him
so
high
in
the
opinion
of
the
world
had
left
his
easel
of
a
morning
to
countenance
a
in
some
suspense
my
dear
old
romney
was
there
by
particular
request
for
who
that
knew
him
would
think
a
pleasure
quite
complete
unless
he
shared
it
or
not
support
a
mortification
more
easily
if
he
were
present
to
console
the
party
was
completed
by
john
myner
the
englishman
by
the
brothers
stennis
and
as
they
used
to
figure
on
their
accounts
at
barbizon
a
pair
of
scots
and
by
the
inevitable
jim
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
bedewed
with
the
sweat
of
anxiety
i
suppose
i
was
little
better
myself
when
i
unveiled
the
genius
of
muskegon
the
master
walked
about
it
seriously
then
he
smiled
is
already
not
so
bad
said
he
in
that
funny
english
of
which
he
was
so
proud
already
not
so
we
all
drew
a
deep
breath
of
relief
and
corporal
john
as
the
most
considerable
junior
present
explained
to
him
it
was
intended
for
a
public
building
a
kind
of
prefecture
quoi
cried
he
relapsing
into
french
que
vous
me
chantez
la
o
in
america
he
added
on
further
information
being
hastily
furnished
is
anozer
sing
o
very
good
very
the
idea
of
the
required
certificate
had
to
be
introduced
to
his
mind
in
the
light
of
a
pleasantry
the
fancy
of
a
nabob
little
more
advanced
than
the
red
indians
of
and
it
took
all
our
talents
combined
to
conceive
a
form
of
words
that
would
be
acceptable
on
both
sides
one
was
found
however
corporal
john
engrossed
it
in
his
undecipherable
hand
the
master
lent
it
the
sanction
of
his
name
and
flourish
i
slipped
it
into
an
envelope
along
with
one
of
the
two
letters
i
had
ready
prepared
in
my
pocket
and
as
the
rest
of
us
moved
off
along
the
boulevard
to
breakfast
pinkerton
was
detached
in
a
cab
and
duly
committed
it
to
the
post
the
breakfast
was
ordered
at
lavenue
where
no
one
need
be
ashamed
to
entertain
even
the
master
the
table
was
laid
in
the
garden
i
had
chosen
the
bill
of
fare
myself
on
the
wine
question
we
held
a
council
of
war
with
the
most
fortunate
results
and
the
talk
as
soon
as
the
master
laid
aside
his
painful
english
became
fast
and
furious
there
were
a
few
interruptions
indeed
in
the
way
of
toasts
the
health
had
to
be
drunk
and
he
responded
in
a
little
speech
full
of
neat
allusions
to
my
future
and
to
the
united
states
my
health
followed
and
then
my
father
must
not
only
be
proposed
and
drunk
but
a
full
report
must
be
despatched
to
him
at
once
by
cablegram
an
extravagance
which
was
almost
the
means
of
the
master
dissolution
choosing
corporal
john
to
be
his
confidant
on
the
ground
i
presume
that
he
was
already
too
good
an
artist
to
be
any
longer
an
american
except
in
name
he
summed
up
his
amazement
in
one
formula
barbare
apart
from
these
genial
formalities
we
talked
talked
of
art
and
talked
of
it
as
only
artists
can
here
in
the
south
seas
we
talk
schooners
most
of
the
time
in
the
quarter
we
talked
art
with
the
like
unflagging
interest
and
perhaps
as
much
result
before
very
long
the
master
went
away
corporal
john
who
was
already
a
sort
of
young
master
followed
on
his
heels
and
the
rank
and
file
were
naturally
relieved
by
their
departure
we
were
now
among
equals
the
bottle
passed
the
conversation
sped
i
think
i
can
still
hear
the
stennis
brothers
pour
forth
their
copious
tirades
dijon
my
portly
french
drop
witticisms
like
himself
and
another
who
was
weak
in
foreign
languages
dash
hotly
into
the
current
of
talk
with
some
trove
que
pore
oon
sontimong
de
delicacy
corot
or
some
moi
corot
est
le
plou
and
then
his
little
raft
of
french
foundering
at
once
scramble
silently
to
shore
again
he
at
least
could
understand
but
to
pinkerton
i
think
the
noise
the
wine
the
sun
the
shadows
of
the
leaves
and
the
esoteric
glory
of
being
seated
at
a
foreign
festival
made
up
the
whole
available
means
of
entertainment
we
sat
down
about
half
past
eleven
i
suppose
it
was
two
when
some
point
arising
and
some
particular
picture
being
instanced
an
adjournment
to
the
louvre
was
proposed
i
paid
the
score
and
in
a
moment
we
were
trooping
down
the
rue
de
renne
it
was
smoking
hot
paris
glittered
with
that
superficial
brilliancy
which
is
so
agreeable
to
the
man
in
high
spirits
and
in
moods
of
dejection
so
depressing
the
wine
sang
in
my
ears
it
danced
and
brightened
in
my
eyes
the
pictures
that
we
saw
that
afternoon
as
we
sped
briskly
and
loquaciously
through
the
immortal
galleries
appear
to
me
upon
a
retrospect
the
loveliest
of
all
the
comments
we
exchanged
to
have
touched
the
highest
mark
of
criticism
grave
or
gay
it
was
only
when
we
issued
again
from
the
museum
that
a
difference
of
race
broke
up
the
party
dijon
proposed
an
adjournment
to
a
cafe
there
to
finish
the
afternoon
on
beer
the
elder
stennis
revolted
at
the
thought
moved
for
the
country
a
forest
if
possible
and
a
long
walk
at
once
the
english
speakers
rallied
to
the
name
of
any
exercise
even
to
me
who
have
been
often
twitted
with
my
sedentary
habits
the
thought
of
country
air
and
stillness
proved
invincibly
attractive
it
appeared
upon
investigation
we
had
just
time
to
hail
a
cab
and
catch
one
of
the
fast
trains
for
fontainebleau
beyond
the
clothes
we
stood
in
all
were
destitute
of
what
is
called
with
dainty
vagueness
personal
effects
and
it
was
earnestly
mooted
on
the
other
side
whether
we
had
not
time
to
call
upon
the
way
and
pack
a
satchel
but
the
stennis
boys
exclaimed
upon
our
effeminacy
they
had
come
from
london
it
appeared
a
week
before
with
nothing
but
greatcoats
and
no
baggage
there
was
the
secret
of
existence
it
was
expensive
to
be
sure
for
every
time
you
had
to
comb
your
hair
a
barber
must
be
paid
and
every
time
you
changed
your
linen
one
shirt
must
be
bought
and
another
thrown
away
but
anything
was
better
argued
these
young
gentlemen
than
to
be
the
slaves
of
haversacks
fellow
has
to
get
rid
gradually
of
all
material
attachments
that
was
said
they
as
long
as
you
were
bound
down
to
anything
house
umbrella
or
portmanteau
you
were
still
tethered
by
the
umbilical
something
engaging
in
this
theory
carried
the
most
of
us
away
the
two
frenchmen
indeed
retired
scoffing
to
their
bock
and
romney
being
too
poor
to
join
the
excursion
on
his
own
resources
and
too
proud
to
borrow
melted
unobtrusively
away
meanwhile
the
remainder
of
the
company
crowded
the
benches
of
a
cab
the
horse
was
urged
as
horses
have
to
be
by
an
appeal
to
the
pocket
of
the
driver
the
train
caught
by
the
inside
of
a
minute
and
in
less
than
an
hour
and
a
half
we
were
breathing
deep
of
the
sweet
air
of
the
forest
and
stretching
our
legs
up
the
hill
from
fontainebleau
octroi
bound
for
barbizon
that
the
leading
members
of
our
party
covered
the
distance
in
minutes
and
a
half
is
i
believe
one
of
the
historic
landmarks
of
the
colony
but
you
will
scarce
be
surprised
to
learn
that
i
was
somewhat
in
the
rear
myner
a
comparatively
philosophic
briton
kept
me
company
in
my
deliberate
advance
the
glory
of
the
sun
going
down
the
fall
of
the
long
shadows
the
inimitable
scent
and
the
inspiration
of
the
woods
attuned
me
more
and
more
to
walk
in
a
silence
which
progressively
infected
my
companion
and
i
remember
that
when
at
last
he
spoke
i
was
startled
from
a
deep
abstraction
father
seems
to
be
a
pretty
good
kind
of
a
father
said
he
do
he
come
to
see
you
i
was
ready
with
some
dozen
of
reasons
and
had
more
in
stock
but
myner
with
that
shrewdness
which
made
him
feared
and
admired
suddenly
fixed
me
with
his
and
asked
press
him
the
blood
came
in
my
face
no
i
had
never
pressed
him
i
had
never
even
encouraged
him
to
come
i
was
proud
of
him
proud
of
his
handsome
looks
of
his
kind
gentle
ways
of
that
bright
face
he
could
show
when
others
were
happy
proud
too
meanly
proud
if
you
like
of
his
great
wealth
and
startling
liberalities
and
yet
he
would
have
been
in
the
way
of
my
paris
life
of
much
of
which
he
would
have
disapproved
i
had
feared
to
expose
to
criticism
his
innocent
remarks
on
art
i
had
told
myself
i
had
even
partly
believed
he
did
not
want
to
come
i
had
been
and
still
am
convinced
that
he
was
sure
to
be
unhappy
out
of
muskegon
in
short
i
had
a
thousand
reasons
good
and
bad
not
all
of
which
could
alter
one
iota
of
the
fact
that
i
knew
he
only
waited
for
my
invitation
you
myner
said
i
a
much
better
fellow
than
ever
i
supposed
i
write
you
a
pretty
decent
sort
yourself
returned
myner
with
more
than
his
usual
flippancy
of
manner
but
as
i
was
gratefully
aware
not
a
trace
of
his
occasional
irony
of
meaning
well
these
were
brave
days
on
which
i
could
dwell
forever
brave
too
were
those
that
followed
when
pinkerton
and
i
walked
paris
and
the
suburbs
viewing
and
pricing
houses
for
my
new
establishment
or
covered
ourselves
with
dust
and
returned
laden
with
chinese
gods
and
brass
from
the
dealers
in
antiquities
i
found
pinkerton
well
up
in
the
situation
of
these
establishments
as
well
as
in
the
current
prices
and
with
quite
a
smattering
of
critical
judgment
it
turned
out
he
was
investing
capital
in
pictures
and
curiosities
for
the
states
and
the
superficial
thoroughness
of
the
creature
appeared
in
the
fact
that
although
he
would
never
be
a
connoisseur
he
was
already
something
of
an
expert
the
things
themselves
left
him
as
near
as
may
be
cold
but
he
had
a
joy
of
his
own
in
understanding
how
to
buy
and
sell
them
in
such
engagements
the
time
passed
until
i
might
very
well
expect
an
answer
from
my
father
two
mails
followed
each
other
and
brought
nothing
by
the
third
i
received
a
long
and
almost
incoherent
letter
of
remorse
encouragement
consolation
and
despair
from
this
pitiful
document
which
with
a
movement
of
piety
i
burned
as
soon
as
i
had
read
it
i
gathered
that
the
bubble
of
my
father
wealth
was
burst
that
he
was
now
both
penniless
and
sick
and
that
i
so
far
from
expecting
ten
thousand
dollars
to
throw
away
in
juvenile
extravagance
must
look
no
longer
for
the
quarterly
remittances
on
which
i
lived
my
case
was
hard
enough
but
i
had
sense
enough
to
perceive
and
decency
enough
to
do
my
duty
i
sold
my
curiosities
or
rather
i
sent
pinkerton
to
sell
them
and
he
had
previously
bought
and
now
disposed
of
them
so
wisely
that
the
loss
was
trifling
this
with
what
remained
of
my
last
allowance
left
me
at
the
head
of
no
less
than
five
thousand
francs
five
hundred
i
reserved
for
my
own
immediate
necessities
the
rest
i
mailed
inside
of
the
week
to
my
father
at
muskegon
where
they
came
in
time
to
pay
his
funeral
expenses
the
news
of
his
death
was
scarcely
a
surprise
and
scarce
a
grief
to
me
i
could
not
conceive
my
father
a
poor
man
he
had
led
too
long
a
life
of
thoughtless
and
generous
profusion
to
endure
the
change
and
though
i
grieved
for
myself
i
was
able
to
rejoice
that
my
father
had
been
taken
from
the
battle
i
grieved
i
say
for
myself
and
it
is
probable
there
were
at
the
same
date
many
thousands
of
persons
grieving
with
less
cause
i
had
lost
my
father
i
had
lost
the
allowance
my
whole
fortune
including
what
had
been
returned
from
muskegon
scarce
amounted
to
a
thousand
francs
and
to
crown
my
sorrows
the
statuary
contract
had
changed
hands
the
new
contractor
had
a
son
of
his
own
or
else
a
nephew
and
it
was
signified
to
me
with
plainness
that
i
must
find
another
market
for
my
pigs
in
the
meanwhile
i
had
given
up
my
room
and
slept
on
a
in
the
corner
of
the
studio
where
as
i
read
myself
to
sleep
at
night
and
when
i
awoke
in
the
morning
that
now
useless
bulk
the
genius
of
muskegon
was
ever
present
to
my
eyes
poor
stone
lady
born
to
be
enthroned
under
the
gilded
echoing
dome
of
the
new
capitol
whither
was
she
now
to
drift
for
what
base
purposes
be
ultimately
broken
up
like
an
unseaworthy
ship
and
what
should
befall
her
artificer
standing
with
his
thousand
francs
on
the
threshold
of
a
life
so
hard
as
that
of
the
unbefriended
sculptor
it
was
a
subject
often
and
earnestly
debated
by
myself
and
pinkerton
in
his
opinion
i
should
instantly
discard
my
profession
drop
it
here
and
now
he
would
say
back
home
with
me
and
let
throw
our
whole
soul
into
business
i
have
the
capital
you
bring
the
culture
dodd
pinkerton
i
never
saw
a
better
name
for
an
advertisement
and
you
ca
think
loudon
how
much
depends
upon
a
on
my
side
i
would
admit
that
a
sculptor
should
possess
one
of
three
things
capital
influence
or
an
energy
only
to
be
qualified
as
hellish
the
first
two
i
had
now
lost
to
the
third
i
never
had
the
smallest
claim
and
yet
i
wanted
the
cowardice
or
perhaps
it
was
the
courage
to
turn
my
back
on
my
career
without
a
fight
i
told
him
besides
that
however
poor
my
chances
were
in
sculpture
i
was
convinced
they
were
yet
worse
in
business
for
which
i
equally
lacked
taste
and
aptitude
but
upon
this
head
he
was
my
father
over
again
assured
me
that
i
spoke
in
ignorance
that
any
intelligent
and
cultured
person
was
bound
to
succeed
that
i
must
besides
have
inherited
some
of
my
father
fitness
and
at
any
rate
that
i
had
been
regularly
trained
for
that
career
in
the
commercial
college
i
said
you
understand
that
as
long
as
i
was
there
i
never
took
the
smallest
interest
in
any
stricken
thing
the
whole
affair
was
poison
to
not
possible
he
would
cry
ca
be
you
could
live
in
the
midst
of
it
and
not
feel
the
charm
with
all
your
poetry
of
soul
you
could
help
loudon
he
would
go
on
drive
me
crazy
you
expect
a
man
to
be
all
broken
up
about
the
sunset
and
not
to
care
a
dime
for
a
place
where
fortunes
are
fought
for
and
made
and
lost
all
day
or
for
a
career
that
consists
in
studying
up
life
till
you
have
it
at
your
spying
out
every
cranny
where
you
can
get
your
hand
in
and
a
dollar
out
and
standing
there
in
the
midst
one
foot
on
bankruptcy
the
other
on
a
borrowed
dollar
and
the
whole
thing
spinning
round
you
like
a
mill
raking
in
the
stamps
in
spite
of
fate
and
to
this
romance
of
dickering
i
would
reply
with
the
romance
which
is
also
the
virtue
of
art
reminding
him
of
those
examples
of
constancy
through
many
tribulations
with
which
the
role
of
apollo
is
illustrated
from
the
case
of
millet
to
those
of
many
of
our
friends
and
comrades
who
had
chosen
this
agreeable
mountain
path
through
life
and
were
now
bravely
clambering
among
rocks
and
brambles
penniless
and
hopeful
will
never
understand
it
pinkerton
i
would
say
look
to
the
result
you
want
to
see
some
profit
of
your
endeavours
that
is
why
you
could
never
learn
to
paint
if
you
lived
to
be
methusalem
the
result
is
always
a
fizzle
the
eyes
of
the
artist
are
turned
in
he
lives
for
a
frame
of
mind
look
at
romney
now
there
is
the
nature
of
the
artist
he
has
a
cent
and
if
you
offered
him
the
command
of
an
army
or
the
presidentship
of
the
united
states
he
would
take
it
and
you
know
he
suppose
not
pinkerton
would
cry
scouring
his
hair
with
both
his
hands
i
ca
see
why
i
ca
see
what
in
fits
he
would
be
after
not
to
i
do
seem
to
rise
to
these
views
of
course
it
the
fault
of
not
having
had
advantages
in
early
life
but
loudon
i
so
miserably
low
that
it
seems
to
me
silly
the
fact
is
he
might
add
with
a
smile
do
seem
to
have
the
least
use
for
a
frame
of
mind
without
square
meals
and
you
ca
get
it
out
of
my
head
that
it
a
man
duty
to
die
rich
if
he
for
i
asked
him
once
i
do
know
he
replied
in
snakes
should
anybody
want
to
be
a
sculptor
if
you
come
to
that
i
would
love
to
sculp
myself
but
what
i
ca
see
is
why
you
should
want
to
do
nothing
else
it
seems
to
argue
a
poverty
of
whether
or
not
he
ever
came
to
understand
me
and
i
have
been
so
tossed
about
since
then
that
i
am
not
very
sure
i
understand
myself
he
soon
perceived
that
i
was
perfectly
in
earnest
and
after
about
ten
days
of
argument
suddenly
dropped
the
subject
and
announced
that
he
was
wasting
capital
and
must
go
home
at
once
no
doubt
he
should
have
gone
long
before
and
had
already
lingered
over
his
intended
time
for
the
sake
of
our
companionship
and
my
misfortune
but
man
is
so
unjustly
minded
that
the
very
fact
which
ought
to
have
disarmed
only
embittered
my
vexation
i
resented
his
departure
in
the
light
of
a
desertion
i
would
not
say
but
doubtless
i
betrayed
it
and
something
in
the
man
face
and
bearing
led
me
to
believe
he
was
himself
remorseful
it
is
certain
at
least
that
during
the
time
of
his
preparations
we
drew
sensibly
apart
a
circumstance
that
i
recall
with
shame
on
the
last
day
he
had
me
to
dinner
at
a
restaurant
which
he
knew
i
had
formerly
frequented
and
had
only
forsworn
of
late
from
considerations
of
economy
he
seemed
ill
at
ease
i
was
myself
both
sorry
and
sulky
and
the
meal
passed
with
little
conversation
loudon
said
he
with
a
visible
effort
after
the
coffee
was
come
and
our
pipes
lighted
can
never
understand
the
gratitude
and
loyalty
i
bear
you
you
do
know
what
a
boon
it
is
to
be
taken
up
by
a
man
that
stands
on
the
pinnacle
of
civilization
you
ca
think
how
it
refined
and
purified
me
how
it
appealed
to
my
spiritual
nature
and
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
would
die
at
your
door
like
a
i
do
know
what
answer
i
tried
to
make
but
he
cut
me
short
me
say
it
out
he
cried
revere
you
for
your
devotion
to
art
i
ca
rise
to
it
but
there
a
strain
of
poetry
in
my
nature
loudon
that
responds
to
it
i
want
you
to
carry
it
out
and
i
mean
to
help
what
nonsense
is
this
i
interrupted
do
get
mad
loudon
this
is
a
plain
piece
of
business
said
he
done
every
day
it
even
typical
how
are
all
those
fellows
over
here
in
paris
henderson
sumner
long
it
all
the
same
story
a
young
man
just
plum
full
of
artistic
genius
on
the
one
side
a
man
of
business
on
the
other
who
does
know
what
to
do
with
his
dollars
you
fool
you
as
poor
as
a
rat
i
cried
wait
till
i
get
my
irons
in
the
fire
returned
pinkerton
bound
to
be
rich
and
i
tell
you
i
mean
to
have
some
of
the
fun
as
i
go
along
here
your
first
allowance
take
it
at
the
hand
of
a
friend
one
that
holds
friendship
sacred
as
you
do
yourself
it
only
a
hundred
francs
you
get
the
same
every
month
and
as
soon
as
my
business
begins
to
expand
we
increase
it
to
something
fitting
and
so
far
from
it
being
a
favour
just
let
me
handle
your
statuary
for
the
american
market
and
i
call
it
one
of
the
smartest
strokes
of
business
in
my
it
took
me
a
long
time
and
it
had
cost
us
both
much
grateful
and
painful
emotion
before
i
had
finally
managed
to
refuse
his
offer
and
compounded
for
a
bottle
of
particular
wine
he
dropped
the
subject
at
last
suddenly
with
a
mind
that
all
done
with
nor
did
he
again
refer
to
the
subject
though
we
passed
together
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
and
i
accompanied
him
on
his
departure
to
the
doors
of
the
at
lazare
i
felt
myself
strangely
alone
a
voice
told
me
that
i
had
rejected
both
the
counsels
of
wisdom
and
the
helping
hand
of
friendship
and
as
i
passed
through
the
great
bright
city
on
my
homeward
way
i
measured
it
for
the
first
time
with
the
eye
of
an
adversary
chapter
in
which
i
am
down
on
my
luck
in
paris
in
no
part
of
the
world
is
starvation
an
agreeable
business
but
i
believe
it
is
admitted
there
is
no
worse
place
to
starve
in
than
this
city
of
paris
the
appearances
of
life
are
there
so
especially
gay
it
is
so
much
a
magnified
the
houses
are
so
ornate
the
theatres
so
numerous
the
very
pace
of
the
vehicles
is
so
brisk
that
a
man
in
any
deep
concern
of
mind
or
pain
of
body
is
constantly
driven
in
upon
himself
in
his
own
eyes
he
seems
the
one
serious
creature
moving
in
a
world
of
horrible
unreality
voluble
people
issuing
from
a
cafe
the
queue
at
theatre
doors
sunday
cabfuls
of
the
bedizened
ladies
of
the
pavement
the
show
in
the
jewellers
windows
all
the
familiar
sights
contributing
to
flout
his
own
unhappiness
want
and
isolation
at
the
same
time
if
he
be
at
all
after
my
pattern
he
is
perhaps
supported
by
a
childish
satisfaction
this
is
life
at
last
he
may
tell
himself
this
is
the
real
thing
the
bladders
on
which
i
was
set
swimming
are
now
empty
my
own
weight
depends
upon
the
ocean
by
my
own
exertions
i
must
perish
or
succeed
and
i
am
now
enduring
in
the
vivid
fact
what
i
so
much
delighted
to
read
of
in
the
case
of
lonsteau
or
lucien
rodolphe
or
schaunard
of
the
steps
of
my
misery
i
can
not
tell
at
length
in
ordinary
times
what
were
politically
called
although
they
were
never
meant
to
be
repaid
were
matters
of
constant
course
among
the
students
and
many
a
man
has
partly
lived
on
them
for
years
but
my
misfortune
befell
me
at
an
awkward
juncture
many
of
my
friends
were
gone
others
were
themselves
in
a
precarious
situation
romney
for
instance
was
reduced
to
tramping
paris
in
a
pair
of
country
sabots
his
only
suit
of
clothes
so
imperfect
in
spite
of
cunningly
adjusted
pins
that
the
authorities
at
the
luxembourg
suggested
his
withdrawal
from
the
gallery
dijon
too
was
on
a
leeshore
designing
clocks
and
for
a
dealer
and
the
most
he
could
do
was
to
offer
me
a
corner
of
his
studio
where
i
might
work
my
own
studio
it
will
be
gathered
i
had
by
that
time
lost
and
in
the
course
of
my
expulsion
the
genius
of
muskegon
was
finally
separated
from
her
author
to
continue
to
possess
a
statue
a
man
must
have
a
studio
a
gallery
or
at
least
the
freedom
of
a
back
garden
he
can
not
carry
it
about
with
him
like
a
satchel
in
the
bottom
of
a
cab
nor
can
he
cohabit
in
a
garret
ten
by
fifteen
with
so
momentous
a
companion
it
was
my
first
idea
to
leave
her
behind
at
my
departure
there
in
her
birthplace
she
might
lend
an
inspiration
methought
to
my
successor
but
the
proprietor
with
whom
i
had
unhappily
quarrelled
seized
the
occasion
to
be
disagreeable
and
called
upon
me
to
remove
my
property
for
a
man
in
such
straits
as
i
now
found
myself
the
hire
of
a
lorry
was
a
consideration
and
yet
even
that
i
could
have
faced
if
i
had
had
anywhere
to
drive
to
after
it
was
hired
hysterical
laughter
seized
upon
me
as
i
beheld
in
imagination
myself
the
waggoner
and
the
genius
of
muskegon
standing
in
the
public
view
of
paris
without
the
shadow
of
a
destination
perhaps
driving
at
last
to
the
nearest
rubbish
heap
and
dumping
there
among
the
ordures
of
a
city
the
beloved
child
of
my
invention
from
these
extremities
i
was
relieved
by
a
seasonable
offer
and
i
parted
from
the
genius
of
muskegon
for
thirty
francs
where
she
now
stands
under
what
name
she
is
admired
or
criticised
history
does
not
inform
us
but
i
like
to
think
she
may
adorn
the
shrubbery
of
some
suburban
where
holiday
hang
their
hats
upon
the
mother
and
their
swains
by
way
of
an
approach
of
gallantry
identify
the
winged
infant
with
the
god
of
love
in
a
certain
cabman
on
the
outer
boulevard
i
got
credit
for
my
midday
meal
supper
i
was
supposed
not
to
require
sitting
down
nightly
to
the
delicate
table
of
some
rich
acquaintances
this
arrangement
was
extremely
my
fable
credible
enough
at
first
and
so
long
as
my
clothes
were
in
good
order
must
have
seemed
worse
than
doubtful
after
my
coat
became
frayed
about
the
edges
and
my
boots
began
to
squelch
and
pipe
along
the
restaurant
floors
the
allowance
of
one
meal
a
day
besides
though
suitable
enough
to
the
state
of
my
finances
agreed
poorly
with
my
stomach
the
restaurant
was
a
place
i
had
often
visited
experimentally
to
taste
the
life
of
students
then
more
unfortunate
than
myself
and
i
had
never
in
those
days
entered
it
without
disgust
or
left
it
without
nausea
it
was
strange
to
find
myself
sitting
down
with
avidity
rising
up
with
satisfaction
and
counting
the
hours
that
divided
me
from
my
return
to
such
a
table
but
hunger
is
a
great
magician
and
so
soon
as
i
had
spent
my
ready
cash
and
could
no
longer
fill
up
on
bowls
of
chocolate
or
hunks
of
bread
i
must
depend
entirely
on
that
cabman
and
upon
certain
rare
windfalls
dijon
for
instance
might
get
paid
for
some
of
his
work
or
else
an
old
friend
would
pass
through
paris
and
then
i
would
be
entertained
to
a
meal
after
my
own
soul
and
contract
a
latin
quarter
loan
which
would
keep
me
in
tobacco
and
my
morning
coffee
for
a
fortnight
it
might
be
thought
the
latter
would
appear
the
more
important
it
might
be
supposed
that
a
life
led
so
near
the
confines
of
actual
famine
should
have
dulled
the
nicety
of
my
palate
on
the
contrary
the
poorer
a
man
diet
the
more
sharply
is
he
set
on
dainties
the
last
of
my
ready
cash
about
thirty
francs
was
deliberately
squandered
on
a
single
dinner
and
a
great
part
of
my
time
when
i
was
alone
was
passed
upon
the
details
of
imaginary
feasts
one
gleam
of
hope
visited
me
an
order
for
a
bust
from
a
rich
southerner
he
was
jolly
of
speech
merry
of
countenance
kept
me
in
good
humour
through
the
sittings
and
when
they
were
over
carried
me
off
with
him
to
dinner
and
the
sights
of
paris
i
ate
well
i
laid
on
flesh
by
all
accounts
i
made
a
favourable
likeness
of
the
being
and
i
confess
i
thought
my
future
was
assured
but
when
the
bust
was
done
and
i
had
despatched
it
across
the
atlantic
i
could
never
so
much
as
learn
of
its
arrival
the
blow
felled
me
i
should
have
lain
down
and
tried
no
stroke
to
right
myself
had
not
the
honour
of
my
country
been
involved
for
dijon
improved
the
opportunity
in
the
european
style
informing
me
for
the
first
time
of
the
manners
of
america
how
it
was
a
den
of
banditti
without
the
smallest
rudiment
of
law
or
order
and
debts
could
be
there
only
collected
with
a
shotgun
whole
world
knows
it
he
would
say
are
alone
mon
petit
loudon
you
are
alone
to
be
in
ignorance
of
these
facts
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
fought
but
the
other
day
with
stilettos
on
the
bench
at
cincinnati
you
should
read
the
little
book
of
one
of
my
friends
touriste
dans
le
you
will
see
it
all
there
in
good
at
last
incensed
by
days
of
such
discussion
i
undertook
to
prove
to
him
the
contrary
and
put
the
affair
in
the
hands
of
my
late
lawyer
from
him
i
had
the
gratification
of
hearing
after
a
due
interval
that
my
debtor
was
dead
of
the
yellow
fever
in
key
west
and
had
left
his
affairs
in
some
confusion
i
suppress
his
name
for
though
he
treated
me
with
cruel
nonchalance
it
is
probable
he
meant
to
deal
fairly
in
the
end
soon
after
this
a
shade
of
change
in
my
reception
at
the
marked
the
beginning
of
a
new
phase
in
my
distress
the
first
day
i
told
myself
it
was
but
fancy
the
next
i
made
quite
sure
it
was
a
fact
the
third
in
mere
panic
i
stayed
away
and
went
for
hours
fasting
this
was
an
act
of
great
unreason
for
the
debtor
who
stays
away
is
but
the
more
remarked
and
the
boarder
who
misses
a
meal
is
sure
to
be
accused
of
infidelity
on
the
fourth
day
therefore
i
returned
inwardly
quaking
the
proprietor
looked
askance
upon
my
entrance
the
waitresses
who
were
his
daughters
neglected
my
wants
and
sniffed
at
the
affected
joviality
of
my
salutations
last
and
most
plain
when
i
called
for
a
suisse
such
as
was
being
served
to
all
the
other
diners
i
was
bluntly
told
there
were
no
more
it
was
obvious
i
was
near
the
end
of
my
tether
one
plank
divided
me
from
want
and
now
i
felt
it
tremble
i
passed
a
sleepless
night
and
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
took
my
way
to
myner
studio
it
was
a
step
i
had
long
meditated
and
long
refrained
from
for
i
was
scarce
intimate
with
the
englishman
and
though
i
knew
him
to
possess
plenty
of
money
neither
his
manner
nor
his
reputation
were
the
least
encouraging
to
beggars
i
found
him
at
work
on
a
picture
which
i
was
able
conscientiously
to
praise
dressed
in
his
usual
tweeds
plain
but
pretty
fresh
and
standing
out
in
disagreeable
contrast
to
my
own
withered
and
degraded
outfit
as
we
talked
he
continued
to
shift
his
eyes
watchfully
between
his
handiwork
and
the
fat
model
who
sat
at
the
far
end
of
the
studio
in
a
state
of
nature
with
one
arm
gallantly
arched
above
her
head
my
errand
would
have
been
difficult
enough
under
the
best
of
circumstances
placed
between
myner
immersed
in
his
art
and
the
white
fat
naked
female
in
a
ridiculous
attitude
i
found
it
quite
impossible
again
and
again
i
attempted
to
approach
the
point
again
and
again
fell
back
on
commendations
of
the
picture
and
it
was
not
until
the
model
had
enjoyed
an
interval
of
repose
during
which
she
took
the
conversation
in
her
own
hands
and
regaled
us
in
a
soft
weak
voice
with
details
as
to
her
husband
prosperity
her
sister
lamented
decline
from
the
paths
of
virtue
and
the
consequent
wrath
of
her
father
a
peasant
of
stern
principles
in
the
vicinity
of
chalons
on
the
marne
it
was
not
i
say
until
after
this
was
over
and
i
had
once
more
cleared
my
throat
for
the
attack
and
once
more
dropped
aside
into
some
commonplace
about
the
picture
that
myner
himself
brought
me
suddenly
and
vigorously
to
the
point
did
come
here
to
talk
this
rot
said
he
i
replied
sullenly
came
to
borrow
he
painted
awhile
in
silence
do
think
we
were
ever
very
intimate
he
asked
you
said
i
can
take
my
answer
and
i
made
as
if
to
go
rage
boiling
in
my
heart
course
you
can
go
if
you
like
said
myner
i
advise
you
to
stay
and
have
it
more
is
there
to
say
i
cried
do
want
to
keep
me
here
for
a
needless
humiliation
here
dodd
you
must
try
and
command
your
temper
said
he
interview
is
of
your
own
seeking
and
not
mine
if
you
suppose
it
not
disagreeable
to
me
you
wrong
and
if
you
think
i
will
give
you
money
without
knowing
thoroughly
about
your
prospects
you
take
me
for
a
fool
besides
he
added
you
come
to
look
at
it
you
got
over
the
worst
of
it
by
now
you
have
done
the
asking
and
you
have
every
reason
to
know
i
mean
to
refuse
i
hold
out
no
false
hopes
but
it
may
be
worth
your
while
to
let
me
thus
i
was
going
to
say
encouraged
i
stumbled
through
my
story
told
him
i
had
credit
at
the
cabman
but
began
to
think
it
was
drawing
to
a
close
how
dijon
lent
me
a
corner
of
his
studio
where
i
tried
to
model
ornaments
figures
for
clocks
time
with
the
scythe
leda
and
the
swan
musketeers
for
candlesticks
and
other
kickshaws
which
had
never
up
to
that
day
been
honoured
with
the
least
approval
your
room
asked
myner
my
room
is
all
right
i
think
said
i
is
a
very
good
old
lady
and
has
never
even
mentioned
her
she
is
a
very
good
old
lady
i
do
see
why
she
should
be
fined
observed
myner
do
you
mean
by
that
i
cried
mean
this
said
he
french
give
a
great
deal
of
credit
amongst
themselves
they
find
it
pays
on
the
whole
or
the
system
would
hardly
be
continued
but
i
ca
see
where
we
come
in
i
ca
see
that
honest
of
us
to
profit
by
their
easy
ways
and
then
skip
over
the
channel
or
as
you
yankees
do
across
the
i
not
proposing
to
skip
i
objected
he
replied
should
you
there
the
problem
you
seem
to
me
to
have
a
lack
of
sympathy
for
the
proprietors
of
by
your
own
account
you
not
getting
on
the
longer
you
stay
it
only
be
the
more
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
dear
old
lady
at
your
lodgings
now
i
tell
you
what
i
do
if
you
consent
to
go
i
pay
your
passage
to
new
york
and
your
railway
fare
and
expenses
to
muskegon
if
i
have
the
name
right
where
your
father
lived
where
he
must
have
left
friends
and
where
no
doubt
you
find
an
opening
i
do
seek
any
gratitude
for
of
course
you
think
me
a
beast
but
i
do
ask
you
to
pay
it
back
when
you
are
able
at
any
rate
that
all
i
can
do
it
might
be
different
if
i
thought
you
a
genius
dodd
but
i
do
and
i
advise
you
not
think
that
was
uncalled
for
at
least
said
i
daresay
it
was
he
returned
with
the
same
steadiness
seemed
to
me
pertinent
and
besides
when
you
ask
me
for
money
upon
no
security
you
treat
me
with
the
liberty
of
a
friend
and
it
to
be
presumed
that
i
can
do
the
like
but
the
point
is
do
you
accept
thank
you
said
i
have
another
string
to
my
right
says
myner
sure
it
honest
i
cried
do
you
mean
by
calling
my
honesty
in
question
wo
if
you
do
like
it
he
replied
seem
to
think
honesty
as
easy
as
blind
man
buff
i
do
it
some
difference
of
i
went
straight
from
this
irritating
interview
during
which
myner
had
never
discontinued
painting
to
the
studio
of
my
old
master
only
one
card
remained
for
me
to
play
and
i
was
now
resolved
to
play
it
i
must
drop
the
gentleman
and
the
and
approach
art
in
the
workman
tunic
this
little
dodd
cried
the
master
and
then
as
his
eye
fell
on
my
dilapidated
clothing
i
thought
i
could
perceive
his
countenance
to
darken
i
made
my
plea
in
english
for
i
knew
if
he
were
vain
of
anything
it
was
of
his
achievement
of
the
island
tongue
said
i
you
take
me
in
your
studio
again
but
this
time
as
a
sought
your
fazer
was
immensely
reech
said
he
i
explained
to
him
that
i
was
now
an
orphan
and
penniless
he
shook
his
head
have
betterr
workmen
waiting
at
my
door
said
he
betterr
workmen
used
to
think
something
of
my
work
sir
i
pleaded
somesing
yes
he
cried
for
a
son
of
a
reech
man
not
enough
for
an
orphan
besides
i
sought
you
might
learn
to
be
an
artist
i
did
not
sink
you
might
learn
to
be
a
on
a
certain
bench
on
the
outer
boulevard
not
far
from
the
tomb
of
napoleon
a
bench
shaded
at
that
date
by
a
shabby
tree
and
commanding
a
view
of
muddy
roadway
and
blank
wall
i
sat
down
to
wrestle
with
my
misery
the
weather
was
cheerless
and
dark
in
three
days
i
had
eaten
but
once
i
had
no
tobacco
my
shoes
were
soaked
my
trousers
horrid
with
mire
my
humour
and
all
the
circumstances
of
the
time
and
place
lugubriously
attuned
here
were
two
men
who
had
both
spoken
fairly
of
my
work
while
i
was
rich
and
wanted
nothing
now
that
i
was
poor
and
lacked
all
genius
said
the
one
enough
for
an
orphan
the
other
and
the
first
offered
me
my
passage
like
a
pauper
immigrant
and
the
second
refused
me
a
day
wage
as
a
hewer
of
stone
plain
dealing
for
an
empty
belly
they
had
not
been
insincere
in
the
past
they
were
not
insincere
change
of
circumstance
had
introduced
a
new
criterion
that
was
all
but
if
i
acquitted
my
two
job
comforters
of
insincerity
i
was
yet
far
from
admitting
them
infallible
artists
had
been
contemned
before
and
had
lived
to
turn
the
laugh
on
their
contemners
how
old
was
corot
before
he
struck
the
vein
of
his
own
precious
metal
when
had
a
young
man
been
more
derided
or
more
justly
so
than
the
god
of
my
admiration
balzac
or
if
i
required
a
bolder
inspiration
what
had
i
to
do
but
turn
my
head
to
where
the
gold
dome
of
the
invalides
glittered
against
inky
squalls
and
recall
the
tale
of
him
sleeping
there
from
the
day
when
a
young
could
be
giggled
at
and
nicknamed
by
frisky
misses
on
to
the
days
of
so
many
crowns
and
so
many
victories
and
so
many
hundred
mouths
of
cannon
and
so
many
thousand
trampling
the
roadways
of
astonished
europe
eighty
miles
in
front
of
the
grand
army
to
go
back
to
give
up
to
proclaim
myself
a
failure
an
ambitious
failure
first
a
rocket
then
a
stick
i
loudon
dodd
who
had
refused
all
other
livelihoods
with
scorn
and
been
advertised
in
the
saint
joseph
as
a
patriot
and
an
artist
to
be
returned
upon
my
native
muskegon
like
damaged
goods
and
go
the
circuit
of
my
father
acquaintance
cap
in
hand
and
begging
to
sweep
offices
no
by
napoleon
i
would
die
at
my
chosen
trade
and
the
two
who
had
that
day
flouted
me
should
live
to
envy
my
success
or
to
weep
tears
of
unavailing
penitence
behind
my
pauper
coffin
meantime
if
my
courage
was
still
undiminished
i
was
none
the
nearer
to
a
meal
at
no
great
distance
my
cabman
stood
at
the
tail
of
a
muddy
on
the
shores
of
a
wide
thoroughfare
of
mud
offering
to
fancy
a
face
of
ambiguous
invitation
i
might
be
received
i
might
once
more
fill
my
belly
there
on
the
other
hand
it
was
perhaps
this
day
the
bolt
was
destined
to
fall
and
i
might
be
expelled
instead
with
vulgar
hubbub
it
was
policy
to
make
the
attempt
and
i
knew
it
was
policy
but
i
had
already
in
the
course
of
that
one
morning
endured
too
many
affronts
and
i
felt
i
could
rather
starve
than
face
another
i
had
courage
and
to
spare
for
the
future
none
left
for
that
day
courage
for
the
main
campaign
but
not
a
spark
of
it
for
that
preliminary
skirmish
of
the
cabman
restaurant
i
continued
accordingly
to
sit
upon
my
bench
not
far
from
the
ashes
of
napoleon
now
drowsy
now
now
in
complete
mental
obstruction
or
only
conscious
of
an
animal
pleasure
in
quiescence
and
now
thinking
planning
and
remembering
with
unexampled
clearness
telling
myself
tales
of
sudden
wealth
and
gustfully
ordering
and
greedily
consuming
imaginary
meals
in
the
course
of
which
i
must
have
dropped
asleep
it
was
towards
dark
that
i
was
suddenly
recalled
to
famine
by
a
cold
souse
of
rain
and
sprang
shivering
to
my
feet
for
a
moment
i
stood
bewildered
the
whole
train
of
my
reasoning
and
dreaming
passed
afresh
through
my
mind
i
was
again
tempted
drawn
as
if
with
cords
by
the
image
of
the
cabman
and
again
recoiled
from
the
possibility
of
insult
dort
dine
thought
i
to
myself
and
took
my
homeward
way
with
wavering
footsteps
through
rainy
streets
in
which
the
lamps
and
the
now
began
to
gleam
still
marshalling
imaginary
dinners
as
i
went
monsieur
dodd
said
the
porter
has
been
a
registered
letter
for
you
the
facteur
will
bring
it
again
a
registered
letter
for
me
who
had
been
so
long
without
one
of
what
it
could
possibly
contain
i
had
no
vestige
of
a
guess
nor
did
i
delay
myself
guessing
far
less
from
any
conscious
plan
of
dishonesty
the
lies
flowed
from
me
like
a
natural
secretion
said
i
remittance
at
last
what
a
bother
i
should
have
missed
it
can
you
lend
me
a
hundred
francs
until
i
had
never
attempted
to
borrow
from
the
porter
till
that
moment
the
registered
letter
was
besides
my
warranty
and
he
gave
me
what
he
had
three
napoleons
and
some
francs
in
silver
i
pocketed
the
money
carelessly
lingered
a
while
chaffing
strolled
leisurely
to
the
door
and
then
fast
as
my
trembling
legs
could
carry
me
round
the
corner
to
the
cafe
de
cluny
french
waiters
are
deft
and
speedy
they
were
not
deft
enough
for
me
and
i
had
scarce
decency
to
let
the
man
set
the
wine
upon
the
table
or
put
the
butter
alongside
the
bread
before
my
glass
and
my
mouth
were
filled
exquisite
bread
of
the
cafe
cluny
exquisite
first
glass
of
old
pomard
tingling
to
my
wet
feet
indescribable
first
olive
culled
from
the
hors
i
suppose
when
i
come
to
lie
dying
and
the
lamp
begins
to
grow
dim
i
shall
still
recall
your
savour
over
the
rest
of
that
meal
and
the
rest
of
the
evening
clouds
lie
thick
clouds
perhaps
of
burgundy
perhaps
more
properly
of
famine
and
repletion
i
remember
clearly
at
least
the
shame
the
despair
of
the
next
morning
when
i
reviewed
what
i
had
done
and
how
i
had
swindled
the
poor
honest
porter
and
as
if
that
were
not
enough
fairly
burnt
my
ships
and
brought
bankruptcy
home
to
that
last
refuge
my
garret
the
porter
would
expect
his
money
i
could
not
pay
him
here
was
scandal
in
the
house
and
i
knew
right
well
the
cause
of
scandal
would
have
to
pack
do
you
mean
by
calling
my
honesty
in
question
i
had
cried
the
day
before
turning
upon
myner
ah
that
day
before
the
day
before
waterloo
the
day
before
the
flood
the
day
before
i
had
sold
the
roof
over
my
head
my
future
and
my
for
a
dinner
at
the
cafe
cluny
in
the
midst
of
these
lamentations
the
famous
registered
letter
came
to
my
door
with
healing
under
its
seals
it
bore
the
postmark
of
san
francisco
where
pinkerton
was
already
struggling
to
the
neck
in
multifarious
affairs
it
renewed
the
offer
of
an
allowance
which
his
improved
estate
permitted
him
to
announce
at
the
figure
of
two
hundred
francs
a
month
and
in
case
i
was
in
some
immediate
pinch
it
enclosed
an
introductory
draft
for
forty
dollars
there
are
a
thousand
excellent
reasons
why
a
man
in
this
epoch
should
decline
to
be
dependent
on
another
but
the
most
numerous
and
cogent
considerations
all
bow
to
a
necessity
as
stern
as
mine
and
the
banks
were
scarce
open
ere
the
draft
was
cashed
it
was
early
in
december
that
i
thus
sold
myself
into
slavery
and
for
six
months
i
dragged
a
slowly
lengthening
chain
of
gratitude
and
uneasiness
at
the
cost
of
some
debt
i
managed
to
excel
myself
and
eclipse
the
genius
of
muskegon
in
a
small
but
highly
patriotic
standard
bearer
for
the
salon
whither
it
was
duly
admitted
where
it
stood
the
proper
length
of
days
entirely
unremarked
and
whence
it
came
back
to
me
as
patriotic
as
before
i
threw
my
whole
soul
as
pinkerton
would
have
phrased
it
into
clocks
and
candlesticks
the
devil
a
would
have
anything
to
say
to
my
designs
even
when
dijon
with
his
infinite
good
humour
and
infinite
scorn
for
all
such
consented
to
peddle
them
in
indiscriminately
with
his
own
the
dealers
still
detected
and
rejected
mine
home
they
returned
to
me
true
as
the
standard
bearer
who
now
at
the
head
of
quite
a
regiment
of
lesser
idols
began
to
grow
an
eyesore
in
the
scanty
studio
of
my
friend
dijon
and
i
have
sat
by
the
hour
and
gazed
upon
that
company
of
images
the
severe
the
frisky
the
classical
the
louis
quinze
were
there
from
joan
of
arc
in
her
soldierly
cuirass
to
leda
with
the
swan
nay
and
god
forgive
me
for
a
man
that
knew
better
the
humorous
was
represented
also
we
sat
and
gazed
i
say
we
criticised
we
turned
them
hither
and
thither
even
upon
the
closest
inspection
they
looked
quite
like
statuettes
and
yet
nobody
would
have
a
gift
of
them
vanity
dies
hard
in
some
obstinate
cases
it
outlives
the
man
but
about
the
sixth
month
when
i
already
owed
near
two
hundred
dollars
to
pinkerton
and
half
as
much
again
in
debts
scattered
about
paris
i
awoke
one
morning
with
a
horrid
sentiment
of
oppression
and
found
i
was
alone
my
vanity
had
breathed
her
last
during
the
night
i
dared
not
plunge
deeper
in
the
bog
i
saw
no
hope
in
my
poor
statuary
i
owned
myself
beaten
at
last
and
sitting
down
in
my
nightshirt
beside
the
window
whence
i
had
a
glimpse
of
the
at
the
corner
of
the
boulevard
and
where
the
music
of
its
early
traffic
fell
agreeably
upon
my
ear
i
penned
my
farewell
to
paris
to
art
to
my
whole
past
life
and
my
whole
former
self
give
in
i
wrote
the
next
allowance
arrives
i
shall
go
straight
out
west
where
you
can
do
what
you
like
with
it
is
to
be
understood
that
pinkerton
had
been
in
a
sense
pressing
me
to
come
from
the
beginning
depicting
his
isolation
among
new
acquaintances
have
none
of
them
your
culture
he
wrote
expressing
his
friendship
in
terms
so
warm
that
it
sometimes
embarrassed
me
to
think
how
poorly
i
could
echo
them
dwelling
upon
his
need
for
assistance
and
the
next
moment
turning
about
to
commend
my
resolution
and
press
me
to
remain
in
paris
remember
loudon
he
would
write
you
ever
do
tire
of
it
there
plenty
of
work
here
for
you
honest
hard
work
developing
the
resources
of
this
practically
virgin
state
and
of
course
i
need
say
what
a
pleasure
it
would
be
to
me
if
we
were
going
at
it
shoulder
to
i
marvel
looking
back
that
i
could
so
long
have
resisted
these
appeals
and
continue
to
sink
my
friend
money
in
a
manner
that
i
knew
him
to
dislike
at
least
when
i
did
awake
to
any
sense
of
my
position
i
awoke
to
it
entirely
and
determined
not
only
to
follow
his
counsel
for
the
future
but
even
as
regards
the
past
to
rectify
his
losses
for
in
this
juncture
of
affairs
i
called
to
mind
that
i
was
not
without
a
possible
resource
and
resolved
at
whatever
cost
of
mortification
to
beard
the
loudon
family
in
their
historic
city
in
the
excellent
scots
phrase
i
made
a
moonlight
flitting
a
thing
never
dignified
but
in
my
case
unusually
easy
as
i
had
scarce
a
pair
of
boots
worth
portage
i
deserted
the
whole
of
my
effects
without
a
pang
dijon
fell
heir
to
joan
of
arc
the
standard
bearer
and
the
musketeers
he
was
present
when
i
bought
and
frugally
stocked
my
new
portmanteau
and
it
was
at
the
door
of
the
trunk
shop
that
i
took
my
leave
of
him
for
my
last
few
hours
in
paris
must
be
spent
alone
it
was
alone
and
at
a
far
higher
figure
than
my
finances
warranted
that
i
discussed
my
dinner
alone
that
i
took
my
ticket
at
saint
lazare
all
alone
though
in
a
carriage
full
of
people
that
i
watched
the
moon
shine
on
the
seine
flood
with
its
tufted
islets
on
rouen
with
her
spires
and
on
the
shipping
in
the
harbour
of
dieppe
when
the
first
light
of
the
morning
called
me
from
troubled
slumbers
on
the
deck
i
beheld
the
dawn
at
first
with
pleasure
i
watched
with
pleasure
the
green
shores
of
england
rising
out
of
rosy
haze
i
took
the
salt
air
with
delight
into
my
nostrils
and
then
all
came
back
to
me
that
i
was
no
longer
an
artist
no
longer
myself
that
i
was
leaving
all
i
cared
for
and
returning
to
all
that
i
detested
the
slave
of
debt
and
gratitude
a
public
and
a
branded
failure
from
this
picture
of
my
own
disgrace
and
wretchedness
it
is
not
wonderful
if
my
mind
turned
with
relief
to
the
thought
of
pinkerton
waiting
for
me
as
i
knew
with
unwearied
affection
and
regarding
me
with
a
respect
that
i
had
never
deserved
and
might
therefore
fairly
hope
that
i
should
never
forfeit
the
inequality
of
our
relation
struck
me
rudely
i
must
have
been
stupid
indeed
if
i
could
have
considered
the
history
of
that
friendship
without
shame
i
who
had
given
so
little
who
had
accepted
and
profited
by
so
much
i
had
the
whole
day
before
me
in
london
and
i
determined
at
least
in
words
to
set
the
balance
somewhat
straighter
seated
in
the
corner
of
a
public
place
and
calling
for
sheet
after
sheet
of
paper
i
poured
forth
the
expression
of
my
gratitude
my
penitence
for
the
past
my
resolutions
for
the
future
till
now
i
told
him
my
course
had
been
mere
selfishness
i
had
been
selfish
to
my
father
and
to
my
friend
taking
their
help
and
denying
them
which
was
all
they
asked
the
poor
gratification
of
my
company
and
countenance
wonderful
are
the
consolations
of
literature
as
soon
as
that
letter
was
written
and
posted
the
consciousness
of
virtue
glowed
in
my
veins
like
some
rare
vintage
chapter
vi
in
which
i
go
west
i
reached
my
uncle
door
next
morning
in
time
to
sit
down
with
the
family
to
breakfast
more
than
three
years
had
intervened
almost
without
mutation
in
that
stationary
household
since
i
had
sat
there
first
a
young
american
freshman
bewildered
among
unfamiliar
dainties
finnan
haddock
kippered
salmon
baps
and
mutton
ham
and
had
wearied
my
mind
in
vain
to
guess
what
should
be
under
the
if
there
were
any
change
at
all
it
seemed
that
i
had
risen
in
the
family
esteem
my
father
death
once
fittingly
referred
to
with
a
ceremonial
lengthening
of
scotch
upper
lips
and
wagging
of
the
female
head
the
party
launched
at
once
god
help
me
into
the
more
cheerful
topic
of
my
own
successes
they
had
been
so
pleased
to
hear
such
good
accounts
of
me
i
was
quite
a
great
man
now
where
was
that
beautiful
statue
of
the
genius
of
something
or
other
have
it
here
not
here
really
asks
the
sprightliest
of
my
cousins
shaking
curls
at
me
as
though
it
were
likely
i
had
brought
it
in
a
cab
or
kept
it
concealed
about
my
person
like
a
birthday
surprise
in
the
bosom
of
this
family
unaccustomed
to
the
tropical
nonsense
of
the
west
it
became
plain
the
and
poor
blethering
pinkerton
had
been
accepted
for
their
face
it
is
not
possible
to
invent
a
circumstance
that
could
have
more
depressed
me
and
i
am
conscious
that
i
behaved
all
through
that
breakfast
like
a
whipt
schoolboy
at
length
the
meal
and
family
prayers
being
both
happily
over
i
requested
the
favour
of
an
interview
with
uncle
adam
on
state
of
my
at
sound
of
this
ominous
expression
the
good
man
face
conspicuously
lengthened
and
when
my
grandfather
having
had
the
proposition
repeated
to
him
for
he
was
hard
of
hearing
announced
his
intention
of
being
present
at
the
interview
i
could
not
but
think
that
uncle
adam
sorrow
kindled
into
momentary
irritation
nothing
however
but
the
usual
grim
cordiality
appeared
upon
the
surface
and
we
all
three
passed
ceremoniously
to
the
adjoining
library
a
gloomy
theatre
for
a
depressing
piece
of
business
my
grandfather
charged
a
clay
pipe
and
sat
tremulously
smoking
in
a
corner
of
the
fireless
chimney
behind
him
although
the
morning
was
both
chill
and
dark
the
window
was
partly
open
and
the
blind
partly
down
i
can
not
depict
what
an
air
he
had
of
being
out
of
place
like
a
man
shipwrecked
there
uncle
adam
had
his
station
at
the
business
table
in
the
midst
valuable
rows
of
books
looked
down
upon
the
place
of
torture
and
i
could
hear
sparrows
chirping
in
the
garden
and
my
sprightly
cousin
already
banging
the
piano
and
pouring
forth
an
acid
stream
of
song
from
the
overhead
it
was
in
these
circumstances
that
with
all
brevity
of
speech
and
a
certain
boyish
sullenness
of
manner
looking
the
while
upon
the
floor
i
informed
my
relatives
of
my
financial
situation
the
amount
i
owed
pinkerton
the
hopelessness
of
any
maintenance
from
sculpture
the
career
offered
me
in
the
states
and
how
before
becoming
more
beholden
to
a
stranger
i
had
judged
it
right
to
lay
the
case
before
my
family
am
only
sorry
you
did
not
come
to
me
at
first
said
uncle
adam
take
the
liberty
to
say
it
would
have
been
more
think
so
too
uncle
adam
i
replied
you
must
bear
in
mind
i
was
ignorant
in
what
light
you
might
regard
my
hope
i
would
never
turn
my
back
on
my
own
flesh
and
blood
he
returned
with
emphasis
but
to
my
anxious
ear
with
more
of
temper
than
affection
could
never
forget
you
were
my
sister
son
i
regard
this
as
a
manifest
duty
i
have
no
choice
but
to
accept
the
entire
responsibility
of
the
position
you
have
i
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
but
murmur
he
pursued
there
is
something
providential
in
the
circumstance
that
you
come
at
the
right
time
in
my
old
firm
there
is
a
vacancy
they
call
themselves
italian
warehousemen
now
he
continued
regarding
me
with
a
twinkle
of
humour
you
may
think
yourself
in
luck
we
were
only
grocers
in
my
day
i
shall
place
you
there
a
moment
uncle
adam
i
broke
in
is
not
at
all
what
i
am
asking
i
ask
you
to
pay
pinkerton
who
is
a
poor
man
i
ask
you
to
clear
my
feet
of
debt
not
to
arrange
my
life
or
any
part
of
i
wished
to
be
harsh
i
might
remind
you
that
beggars
can
not
be
choosers
said
my
uncle
as
to
managing
your
life
you
have
tried
your
own
way
already
and
you
see
what
you
have
made
of
it
you
must
now
accept
the
guidance
of
those
older
and
whatever
you
may
think
of
it
wiser
than
yourself
all
these
schemes
of
your
friend
of
whom
i
know
nothing
by
the
by
and
talk
of
openings
in
the
west
i
simply
disregard
i
have
no
idea
whatever
of
your
going
trekking
across
a
continent
on
a
chase
in
this
situation
which
i
am
fortunately
able
to
place
at
your
disposal
and
which
many
a
young
man
would
be
glad
to
jump
at
you
will
receive
to
begin
with
eighteen
shillings
a
shillings
a
week
i
cried
my
poor
friend
gave
me
more
than
that
for
nothing
i
think
it
is
this
very
friend
you
are
now
trying
to
repay
observed
my
uncle
with
an
air
of
one
advancing
a
strong
argument
said
my
grandfather
vexed
you
should
be
present
at
this
business
quoth
uncle
adam
swinging
rather
obsequiously
towards
the
stonemason
i
must
remind
you
it
is
of
your
own
repeated
the
old
man
sir
i
am
listening
says
my
uncle
my
grandfather
took
a
puff
or
two
in
silence
and
then
makin
an
awfu
poor
appearance
aadam
said
he
my
uncle
visibly
reared
at
the
affront
sorry
you
should
think
so
said
he
still
more
sorry
you
should
say
so
before
present
believe
that
a
ken
that
aadam
returned
old
loudon
dryly
the
curiis
thing
is
i
no
very
carin
see
here
ma
man
he
continued
addressing
himself
to
me
your
grandfaither
am
i
not
never
you
mind
what
aadam
says
a
see
justice
din
ye
a
said
uncle
adam
would
like
one
word
with
you
in
i
rose
to
go
down
upon
your
hinderlands
cried
my
grandfather
almost
savagely
aadam
has
anything
to
say
let
him
say
it
it
me
that
has
the
money
here
and
by
gravy
i
goin
to
be
upon
this
scurvy
encouragement
it
appeared
that
my
uncle
had
no
remark
to
offer
twice
challenged
to
out
and
be
done
with
it
he
twice
sullenly
declined
and
i
may
mention
that
about
this
period
of
the
engagement
i
began
to
be
sorry
for
him
here
then
jeannie
yin
resumed
my
grandfather
goin
to
give
ye
a
your
mither
was
always
my
for
a
never
could
agree
with
aadam
a
like
ye
fine
yoursel
there
nae
noansense
aboot
ye
ye
a
fine
nayteral
idee
of
builder
work

to
france
where
they
tell
me
they
grand
at
the
stuccy
a
splendid
thing
for
ceilin
the
stuccy
and
it
a
vailyable
disguise
too
a
believe
there
a
builder
in
scotland
has
used
more
stuccy
than
me
but
as
a
was
sayin
if
ye
follie
that
trade
with
the
capital
that
goin
to
give
ye
ye
may
live
yet
to
be
as
rich
as
mysel
ye
see
ye
would
have
always
had
a
share
of
it
when
a
was
gone
it
appears
needin
it
now
well
ye
get
the
less
as
is
only
just
and
uncle
adam
cleared
his
throat
is
very
handsome
father
said
he
i
am
sure
loudon
feels
it
so
very
handsome
and
as
you
say
very
just
but
will
you
allow
me
to
say
that
it
had
better
perhaps
be
put
in
black
and
white
the
enmity
always
smouldering
between
the
two
men
at
this
interruption
almost
burst
in
flame
the
stonemason
turned
upon
his
offspring
his
long
upper
lip
pulled
down
for
all
the
world
like
a
monkey
he
stared
a
while
in
virulent
silence
and
then
gregg
said
he
the
effect
of
these
words
was
very
visible
will
be
gone
to
his
office
stammered
my
uncle
gregg
repeated
my
grandfather
tell
you
he
will
be
gone
to
his
office
reiterated
adam
i
tell
ye
he
takin
his
smoke
retorted
the
old
man
well
then
cried
my
uncle
getting
to
his
feet
with
some
alacrity
as
upon
a
sudden
change
of
thought
will
get
him
will
not
cried
my
grandfather
will
sit
there
upon
your
how
the
devil
am
i
to
get
him
my
uncle
broke
forth
with
not
unnatural
petulance
my
grandfather
having
no
possible
answer
grinned
at
his
son
with
the
malice
of
a
schoolboy
then
he
rang
the
bell
the
garden
key
said
uncle
adam
to
the
servant
over
to
the
garden
and
if
gregg
the
lawyer
is
there
he
generally
sits
under
the
red
hawthorn
give
him
old
loudon
compliments
and
will
he
step
in
here
for
a
moment
gregg
the
lawyer
at
once
i
understood
what
had
been
puzzling
me
the
significance
of
my
grandfather
and
the
alarm
of
my
poor
uncle
the
stonemason
will
it
was
supposed
hung
trembling
in
the
balance
here
grandfather
i
said
did
want
any
of
this
all
i
wanted
was
a
loan
of
say
two
hundred
pounds
i
can
take
care
of
myself
i
have
prospects
and
opportunities
good
friends
in
the
states
the
old
man
waved
me
down
me
that
speaks
here
he
said
curtly
and
we
waited
the
coming
of
the
lawyer
in
a
triple
silence
he
appeared
at
last
the
maid
ushering
him
in
a
spectacled
dry
but
not
ungenial
looking
man
gregg
cried
my
grandfather
a
question
what
has
aadam
got
to
do
with
my
will
afraid
i
do
quite
understand
said
the
lawyer
staring
has
he
got
to
do
with
it
repeated
the
old
man
smiting
with
his
fist
upon
the
arm
of
his
chair
my
money
mine
or
is
it
aadam
can
aadam
interfere
i
see
said
gregg
not
on
the
marriage
of
both
of
your
children
a
certain
sum
was
paid
down
and
accepted
in
full
of
legitim
you
have
surely
not
forgotten
the
circumstance
loudon
that
if
i
like
concluded
my
grandfather
hammering
out
his
words
can
leave
every
doit
i
die
possessed
of
to
the
great
magunn
meaning
probably
the
great
mogul
doubt
of
it
replied
gregg
with
a
shadow
of
a
smile
hear
that
aadam
asked
my
grandfather
may
be
allowed
to
say
i
had
no
need
to
hear
it
said
my
uncle
well
says
my
grandfather
and
jeannie
yin
can
go
for
a
bit
walk
me
and
gregg
has
when
once
i
was
in
the
hall
alone
with
uncle
adam
i
turned
to
him
sick
at
heart
adam
i
said
can
understand
better
than
i
can
say
how
very
painful
all
this
is
to
i
am
sorry
you
have
seen
your
grandfather
in
so
unamiable
a
light
replied
this
extraordinary
man
should
allow
it
to
affect
your
mind
though
he
has
sterling
qualities
quite
an
extraordinary
character
and
i
have
no
fear
but
he
means
to
behave
handsomely
to
his
composure
was
beyond
my
imitation
the
house
could
not
contain
me
nor
could
i
even
promise
to
return
to
it
in
concession
to
which
weakness
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
call
in
about
an
hour
at
the
office
of
the
lawyer
whom
as
he
left
the
library
uncle
adam
should
waylay
and
inform
of
the
arrangement
i
suppose
there
was
never
a
more
situation
you
would
have
thought
it
was
i
who
had
suffered
some
rebuff
and
that
adam
was
a
generous
conqueror
who
scorned
to
take
advantage
it
was
plain
enough
that
i
was
to
be
endowed
to
what
extent
and
upon
what
conditions
i
was
now
left
for
an
hour
to
meditate
in
the
wide
and
solitary
thoroughfares
of
the
new
town
taking
counsel
with
statues
of
george
iv
and
william
pitt
improving
my
mind
with
the
pictures
in
the
window
of
a
and
renewing
my
acquaintance
with
edinburgh
east
wind
by
the
end
of
the
hour
i
made
my
way
to
gregg
office
where
i
was
placed
with
a
few
appropriate
words
in
possession
of
a
cheque
for
two
thousand
pounds
and
a
small
parcel
of
architectural
works
loudon
bids
me
add
continued
the
lawyer
consulting
a
little
sheet
of
notes
although
these
volumes
are
very
valuable
to
the
practical
builder
you
must
be
careful
not
to
lose
originality
he
tells
you
also
not
to
be
doun
his
own
expression
by
the
theory
of
strains
and
that
portland
cement
properly
sanded
will
go
a
long
i
smiled
and
remarked
that
i
supposed
it
would
once
lived
in
one
of
my
excellent
client
houses
observed
the
lawyer
i
was
tempted
in
that
case
to
think
it
had
gone
far
these
circumstances
sir
said
i
will
be
rather
relieved
to
hear
that
i
have
no
intention
of
becoming
a
at
this
he
fairly
laughed
and
the
ice
being
broken
i
was
able
to
consult
him
as
to
my
conduct
he
insisted
i
must
return
to
the
house
at
least
for
luncheon
and
one
of
my
walks
with
loudon
the
evening
i
will
furnish
you
with
an
excuse
if
you
please
said
he
asking
you
to
a
bachelor
dinner
with
myself
but
the
luncheon
and
the
walk
are
unavoidable
he
is
an
old
man
and
i
believe
really
fond
of
you
he
would
naturally
feel
aggrieved
if
there
were
any
appearance
of
avoiding
him
and
as
for
adam
do
you
know
i
think
your
delicacy
out
of
place
and
now
dodd
what
are
you
to
do
with
this
money
ay
there
was
the
question
with
two
thousand
pounds
fifty
thousand
francs
i
might
return
to
paris
and
the
arts
and
be
a
prince
and
millionaire
in
that
thrifty
latin
quarter
i
think
i
had
the
grace
with
one
corner
of
my
mind
to
be
glad
that
i
had
sent
the
london
letter
i
know
very
well
that
with
the
rest
and
worst
of
me
i
repented
bitterly
of
that
precipitate
act
on
one
point
however
my
whole
multiplex
estate
of
man
was
unanimous
the
letter
being
gone
there
was
no
help
but
i
must
follow
the
money
was
accordingly
divided
in
two
unequal
shares
for
the
first
gregg
got
me
a
bill
in
the
name
of
dijon
to
meet
my
liabilities
in
paris
for
the
second
as
i
had
already
cash
in
hand
for
the
expenses
of
my
journey
he
supplied
me
with
drafts
on
san
francisco
the
rest
of
my
business
in
edinburgh
not
to
dwell
on
a
very
agreeable
dinner
with
the
lawyer
or
the
horrors
of
the
family
luncheon
took
the
form
of
an
excursion
with
the
stonemason
who
led
me
this
time
to
no
suburb
or
work
of
his
old
hands
but
with
an
impulse
both
natural
and
pretty
to
that
more
enduring
home
which
he
had
chosen
for
his
clay
it
was
in
a
cemetery
by
some
strange
chance
immured
within
the
bulwarks
of
a
prison
standing
besides
on
the
margin
of
a
cliff
crowded
with
elderly
stone
memorials
and
green
with
turf
and
ivy
the
east
wind
which
i
thought
too
harsh
for
the
old
man
continually
shook
the
boughs
and
the
thin
sun
of
a
scottish
summer
drew
their
dancing
shadows
wanted

when
i
was
a
boy
eh
ecky
ye
an
auld
man
i
had
a
second
and
sadder
experience
of
graveyards
at
my
next
the
city
of
muskegon
now
rendered
conspicuous
by
the
dome
of
the
new
capitol
encaged
in
scaffolding
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
i
arrived
and
raining
and
as
i
walked
in
great
streets
of
the
very
name
of
which
i
was
quite
ignorant
double
treble
and
quadruple
lines
of
jingling
by
wires
of
telegraph
and
telephone
matting
heaven
above
my
head
huge
staring
houses
garish
and
gloomy
flanking
me
from
either
hand
the
thought
of
the
rue
racine
ay
and
of
the
cabman
brought
tears
to
my
eyes
the
whole
monotonous
babel
had
grown
or
i
should
rather
say
swelled
with
such
a
leap
since
my
departure
that
i
must
continually
inquire
my
way
and
the
very
cemetery
was
brand
new
death
however
had
been
active
the
graves
were
already
numerous
and
i
must
pick
my
way
in
the
rain
among
the
tawdry
sepulchres
of
millionnaires
and
past
the
plain
black
crosses
of
hungarian
labourers
till
chance
or
instinct
led
me
to
the
place
that
was
my
father
the
stone
had
been
erected
i
knew
already
admiring
i
could
now
judge
their
taste
in
monuments
their
taste
in
literature
methought
i
could
imagine
and
i
refrained
from
drawing
near
enough
to
read
the
terms
of
the
inscription
but
the
name
was
in
larger
letters
and
stared
at
me
james
dodd
what
a
singular
thing
is
a
name
i
thought
how
it
clings
to
a
man
and
continually
misrepresents
and
then
survives
him
and
it
flashed
across
my
mind
with
a
mixture
of
regret
and
bitter
mirth
that
i
had
never
known
and
now
probably
never
should
know
what
the
k
had
represented
king
kilter
kay
kaiser
i
went
running
over
names
at
random
and
then
stumbled
with
ludicrous
misspelling
on
kornelius
and
had
nearly
laughed
aloud
i
have
never
been
more
childish
i
suppose
although
the
deeper
voices
of
my
nature
seemed
all
dumb
because
i
have
never
been
more
moved
and
at
this
last
incongruous
antic
of
my
nerves
i
was
seized
with
a
panic
of
remorse
and
fled
the
cemetery
scarce
less
funereal
was
the
rest
of
my
experience
in
muskegon
where
nevertheless
i
lingered
visiting
my
father
circle
for
some
days
it
was
in
piety
to
him
i
lingered
and
i
might
have
spared
myself
the
pain
his
memory
was
already
quite
gone
out
for
his
sake
indeed
i
was
made
welcome
and
for
mine
the
conversation
rolled
awhile
with
laborious
effort
on
the
virtues
of
the
deceased
his
former
comrades
dwelt
in
my
company
upon
his
business
talents
or
his
generosity
for
public
purposes
when
my
back
was
turned
they
remembered
him
no
more
my
father
had
loved
me
i
had
left
him
alone
to
live
and
die
among
the
indifferent
now
i
returned
to
find
him
dead
and
buried
and
forgotten
unavailing
penitence
translated
itself
in
my
thoughts
to
fresh
resolve
there
was
another
poor
soul
who
loved
me
pinkerton
i
must
not
be
guilty
twice
of
the
same
error
a
week
perhaps
had
been
thus
wasted
nor
had
i
prepared
my
friend
for
the
delay
accordingly
when
i
had
changed
trains
at
council
bluffs
i
was
aware
of
a
man
appearing
at
the
end
of
the
car
with
a
telegram
in
his
hand
and
inquiring
whether
there
were
any
one
aboard
the
name
of
london
dodd
i
thought
the
name
near
enough
claimed
the
despatch
and
found
it
was
from
pinkerton
day
do
you
arrive
awfully
i
sent
him
an
answer
giving
day
and
hour
and
at
ogden
found
a
fresh
despatch
awaiting
me
will
do
unspeakable
relief
meet
you
at
in
paris
days
i
had
a
private
name
for
pinkerton
was
what
i
had
called
him
in
hours
of
bitterness
and
the
name
rose
once
more
on
my
lips
what
mischief
was
he
up
to
now
what
new
bowl
was
my
benignant
monster
brewing
for
his
frankenstein
in
what
new
imbroglio
should
i
alight
on
the
pacific
coast
my
trust
in
the
man
was
entire
and
my
distrust
perfect
i
knew
he
would
never
mean
amiss
but
i
was
convinced
he
would
almost
never
in
my
sense
do
aright
i
suppose
these
vague
anticipations
added
a
shade
of
gloom
to
that
already
gloomy
place
of
travel
nebraska
wyoming
utah
nevada
scowled
in
my
face
at
least
and
seemed
to
point
me
back
again
to
that
other
native
land
of
mine
the
latin
quarter
but
when
the
sierras
had
been
climbed
and
the
train
after
so
long
beating
and
panting
stretched
itself
upon
the
downward
track
when
i
beheld
that
vast
extent
of
prosperous
country
rolling
seaward
from
the
woods
and
the
blue
mountains
that
illimitable
spread
of
rippling
corn
the
trees
growing
and
blowing
in
the
merry
weather
the
country
boys
thronging
aboard
the
train
with
figs
and
peaches
and
the
conductors
and
the
very
darky
stewards
visibly
exulting
in
the
change
up
went
my
soul
like
a
balloon
care
fell
from
his
perch
upon
my
shoulders
and
when
i
spied
my
pinkerton
among
the
crowd
at
sacramento
i
thought
of
nothing
but
to
shout
and
wave
for
him
and
grasp
him
by
the
hand
like
what
he
was
my
dearest
friend
loudon
he
cried
how
i
pined
for
you
and
you
have
come
an
hour
too
soon
you
known
here
and
waited
for
i
been
booming
you
already
you
billed
for
a
lecture
night
life
in
paris
grave
and
twelve
hundred
places
booked
at
the
last
stock
tut
man
you
looking
thin
here
try
a
drop
of
and
he
produced
a
case
bottle
staringly
labelled
pinkerton
thirteen
star
golden
state
brandy
warranted
entire
bless
me
said
i
gasping
and
winking
after
my
first
plunge
into
this
fiery
fluid
what
does
entire
mean
loudon
you
ought
to
know
that
cried
pinkerton
real
english
you
see
it
on
all
the
wayside
hostelries
over
if
i
not
mistaken
it
means
something
warranted
entirely
different
said
i
applies
to
the
public
house
and
not
the
beverages
very
possible
said
jim
quite
unabashed
effective
anyway
and
i
can
tell
you
sir
it
has
boomed
that
spirit
it
goes
now
by
the
gross
of
cases
by
the
way
i
hope
you
wo
mind
i
got
your
portrait
all
over
san
francisco
for
the
lecture
enlarged
from
that
carte
de
visite
loudon
dodd
the
sculptor
a
proof
of
the
small
handbills
the
posters
are
the
same
only
in
red
and
blue
and
the
letters
fourteen
by
i
looked
at
the
handbill
and
my
head
turned
what
was
the
use
of
words
why
seek
to
explain
to
pinkerton
the
knotted
horrors
of
he
took
an
early
occasion
to
point
it
out
as
a
good
phrase
gives
the
two
sides
at
a
glance
i
wanted
the
lecture
written
up
to
even
after
we
had
reached
san
francisco
and
at
the
actual
physical
shock
of
my
own
effigy
placarded
on
the
streets
i
had
broken
forth
in
petulant
words
he
never
comprehended
in
the
least
the
ground
of
my
aversion
i
had
only
known
you
disliked
red
lettering
was
as
high
as
he
could
rise
are
perfectly
right
a
black
is
preferable
and
shows
a
great
deal
further
the
only
thing
that
pains
me
is
the
portrait
i
own
i
thought
that
a
success
i
dreadfully
and
truly
sorry
my
dear
fellow
i
see
now
it
not
what
you
had
a
right
to
expect
but
i
did
it
loudon
for
the
best
and
the
press
is
all
at
the
moment
sweeping
through
green
tule
swamps
i
fell
direct
on
the
essential
pinkerton
i
cried
lecture
is
the
maddest
of
your
madnesses
how
can
i
prepare
a
lecture
in
thirty
hours
done
loudon
he
exclaimed
in
triumph
ready
trust
me
to
pull
a
piece
of
business
through
you
find
it
all
in
my
desk
at
home
i
put
the
best
talent
of
san
francisco
on
the
job
harry
miller
the
brightest
pressman
in
the
and
so
he
rattled
on
beyond
reach
of
my
modest
protestations
blurting
out
his
complicated
interests
crying
up
his
new
acquaintances
and
ever
and
again
hungering
to
introduce
me
to
some
grand
fellow
as
sharp
as
a
needle
from
whom
and
the
very
thought
of
whom
my
spirit
shrank
instinctively
well
i
was
in
for
it
in
for
pinkerton
in
for
the
portrait
in
for
the
lecture
one
promise
i
extorted
that
i
was
never
again
to
be
committed
in
ignorance
even
for
that
when
i
saw
how
its
extortion
puzzled
and
depressed
the
irrepressible
my
soul
repented
me
and
in
all
else
i
suffered
myself
to
be
led
uncomplaining
at
his
chariot
wheels
the
irrepressible
did
i
say
the
irresistible
were
nigher
truth
but
the
time
to
have
seen
me
was
when
i
sat
down
to
harry
lecture
he
was
a
facetious
dog
this
harry
miller
he
had
a
gallant
way
of
skirting
the
indecent
which
in
my
case
produced
physical
nausea
and
he
could
be
sentimental
and
even
melodramatic
about
grisettes
and
starving
genius
i
found
he
had
enjoyed
the
benefit
of
my
correspondence
with
pinkerton
adventures
of
my
own
were
here
and
there
horridly
misrepresented
sentiments
of
my
own
echoed
and
exaggerated
till
i
blushed
to
recognise
them
i
will
do
harry
miller
justice
he
must
have
had
a
kind
of
talent
almost
of
genius
all
attempts
to
lower
his
tone
proving
fruitless
and
the
ineradicable
nay
the
monster
had
a
certain
key
of
style
or
want
of
style
so
that
certain
milder
passages
which
i
sought
to
introduce
discorded
horribly
and
impoverished
if
that
were
possible
the
general
effect
by
an
early
hour
of
the
numbered
evening
i
might
have
been
observed
at
the
sign
of
the
poodle
dog
dining
with
my
agent
so
pinkerton
delighted
to
describe
himself
thence
like
an
ox
to
the
slaughter
he
led
me
to
the
hall
where
i
stood
presently
alone
confronting
assembled
san
francisco
with
no
better
allies
than
a
table
a
glass
of
water
and
a
mass
of
manuscript
and
typework
representing
harry
miller
and
myself
i
read
the
lecture
for
i
had
lacked
both
time
and
will
to
get
the
trash
by
heart
read
it
hurriedly
humbly
and
with
visible
shame
now
and
then
i
would
catch
in
the
auditorium
an
eye
of
some
intelligence
now
and
then
in
the
manuscript
would
stumble
on
a
richer
vein
of
harry
miller
and
my
heart
would
fail
me
and
i
gabbled
the
audience
yawned
it
stirred
uneasily
it
muttered
grumbled
and
broke
forth
at
last
in
articulate
cries
of
up
and
can
hear
i
took
to
skipping
and
being
extremely
with
the
country
almost
invariably
cut
in
again
in
the
unintelligible
midst
of
some
new
topic
what
struck
me
as
extremely
ominous
these
misfortunes
were
allowed
to
pass
without
a
laugh
indeed
i
was
beginning
to
fear
the
worst
and
even
personal
indignity
when
all
at
once
the
humour
of
the
thing
broke
upon
me
strongly
i
could
have
laughed
aloud
and
being
again
summoned
to
speak
up
i
faced
my
patrons
for
the
first
time
with
a
smile
well
i
said
will
try
though
i
do
suppose
anybody
wants
to
hear
and
i
ca
see
why
anybody
audience
and
lecturer
laughed
together
till
the
tears
ran
down
vociferous
and
repeated
applause
hailed
my
impromptu
sally
another
hit
which
i
made
but
a
little
after
as
i
turned
three
pages
of
the
copy
see
i
am
leaving
out
as
much
as
i
possibly
can
increased
the
esteem
with
which
my
patrons
had
begun
to
regard
me
and
when
i
left
the
stage
at
last
my
departing
form
was
cheered
with
laughter
stamping
shouting
and
the
waving
of
hats
pinkerton
was
in
the
feverishly
jotting
in
his
as
he
saw
me
enter
he
sprang
up
and
i
declare
the
tears
were
trickling
on
his
cheeks
dear
boy
he
cried
can
never
forgive
myself
and
you
can
never
forgive
me
never
mind
i
did
it
for
the
best
and
how
nobly
you
clung
on
i
dreaded
we
should
have
had
to
return
the
money
at
the
would
have
been
more
honest
if
we
had
said
i
the
pressmen
followed
me
harry
miller
in
the
front
ranks
and
i
was
amazed
to
find
them
on
the
whole
a
pleasant
set
of
lads
probably
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
and
even
harry
miller
apparently
a
gentleman
i
had
in
oysters
and
champagne
for
the
receipts
were
excellent
and
being
in
a
high
state
of
nervous
tension
kept
the
table
in
a
roar
indeed
i
was
never
in
my
life
so
well
inspired
as
when
i
described
my
vigil
over
harry
miller
literature
or
the
series
of
my
emotions
as
i
faced
the
audience
the
lads
vowed
i
was
the
soul
of
good
company
and
the
prince
of
lecturers
and
so
wonderful
an
institution
is
the
popular
press
if
you
had
seen
the
notices
next
day
in
all
the
papers
you
must
have
supposed
my
evening
entertainment
an
unqualified
success
i
was
in
excellent
spirits
when
i
returned
home
that
night
but
the
miserable
pinkerton
sorrowed
for
us
both
loudon
he
said
shall
never
forgive
myself
when
i
saw
you
did
catch
on
to
the
idea
of
the
lecture
i
should
have
given
it
myself

a
brief
study
of
pinkerton
in
his
new
setting
convinced
me
of
a
kindred
truth
about
that
other
and
mental
digestion
by
which
we
extract
what
is
called
for
our
out
of
life
in
the
same
spirit
as
a
schoolboy
deep
in
mayne
reid

a
dummy

pinkerton
sped
through
kearney
street
upon
his
daily
business
representing
to
himself
a
highly
coloured
part
in
life
performance
and
happy
for
hours
if
he
should
have
chanced
to
brush
against
a
millionnaire
reality
was
his
romance
he
gloried
to
be
thus
engaged
he
wallowed
in
his
business
suppose
a
man
to
dig
up
a
galleon
on
the
coromandel
coast
his
rakish
schooner
keeping
the
while
an
offing
under
easy
sail
and
he
by
the
blaze
of
a
great
fire
of
wreckwood
to
measure
ingots
by
the
bucketful
on
the
uproarious
beach
such
an
one
might
realise
a
greater
material
spoil
he
should
have
no
more
profit
of
romance
than
pinkerton
when
he
cast
up
his
weekly
in
a
bald
office
every
dollar
gained
was
like
something
brought
ashore
from
a
mysterious
deep
every
venture
made
was
like
a
diver
plunge
and
as
he
thrust
his
bold
hand
into
the
plexus
of
the
he
was
delightedly
aware
of
how
he
shook
the
pillars
of
existence
turned
out
men
as
at
a
to
labour
in
far
countries
and
set
the
gold
twitching
in
the
drawers
of
millionnaires
i
could
never
fathom
the
full
extent
of
his
speculations
but
there
were
five
separate
businesses
which
he
avowed
and
carried
like
a
banner
the
thirteen
star
golden
state
brandy
warranted
entire
a
very
flagrant
distillation
filled
a
great
part
of
his
thoughts
and
was
kept
before
the
public
in
an
eloquent
but
misleading
treatise
drink
french
brandy
a
word
to
the
he
kept
an
office
for
advertisers
counselling
designing
acting
as
middleman
with
printers
and
for
the
inexperienced
or
the
uninspired
the
dull
haberdasher
came
to
him
for
ideas
the
smart
theatrical
agent
for
his
local
knowledge
and
one
and
all
departed
with
a
copy
of
his
pamphlet
when
and
where
or
the
advertiser
he
had
a
tug
chartered
every
saturday
afternoon
and
night
carried
people
outside
the
heads
and
provided
them
with
lines
and
bait
for
six
hours
fishing
at
the
rate
of
five
dollars
a
person
i
am
told
that
some
of
them
doubtless
adroit
anglers
made
a
profit
on
the
transaction
occasionally
he
bought
wrecks
and
condemned
vessels
these
latter
i
can
not
tell
you
how
found
their
way
to
sea
again
under
aliases
and
continued
to
stem
the
waves
triumphantly
enough
under
the
colours
of
bolivia
or
nicaragua
lastly
there
was
a
certain
agricultural
engine
glorying
in
a
great
deal
of
vermilion
and
blue
paint
and
filling
it
appeared
a
want
in
which
his
interest
was
something
like
a
tenth
this
for
the
face
or
front
of
his
concerns
the
outside
as
he
phrased
it
he
was
variously
and
mysteriously
engaged
no
dollar
slept
in
his
possession
rather
he
kept
all
simultaneously
flying
like
a
conjurer
with
oranges
my
own
earnings
when
i
began
to
have
a
share
he
would
but
show
me
for
a
moment
and
disperse
again
like
those
illusive
money
gifts
which
are
flashed
in
the
eyes
of
childhood
only
to
be
entombed
in
the
missionary
box
and
he
would
come
down
radiant
from
a
weekly
clap
me
on
the
shoulder
declare
himself
a
winner
by
gargantuan
figures
and
prove
destitute
of
a
quarter
for
a
drink
on
earth
have
you
done
with
it
i
would
ask
the
mill
again
all
he
would
cry
with
infinite
delight
investment
was
ever
his
word
he
could
not
bear
what
he
called
gambling
touch
stocks
loudon
he
would
say
but
legitimate
and
yet
heaven
knows
many
an
indurated
gambler
might
have
drawn
back
appalled
at
the
first
hint
of
some
of
investments
one
which
i
succeeded
in
tracking
home
and
instance
for
a
specimen
was
a
seventh
share
in
the
charter
of
a
certain
schooner
bound
for
mexico
to
smuggle
weapons
on
the
one
trip
and
cigars
upon
the
other
the
latter
end
of
this
enterprise
involving
as
it
did
shipwreck
confiscation
and
a
lawsuit
with
the
underwriters
was
too
painful
to
be
dwelt
upon
at
length
proved
a
disappointment
was
as
far
as
my
friend
would
go
with
me
in
words
but
i
knew
from
observation
that
the
fabric
of
his
fortunes
tottered
for
the
rest
it
was
only
by
accident
i
got
wind
of
the
transaction
for
pinkerton
after
a
time
was
shy
of
introducing
me
to
his
arcana
the
reason
you
are
to
hear
presently
the
office
which
was
or
should
have
been
the
point
of
rest
for
so
many
evolving
dollars
stood
in
the
heart
of
the
city
a
high
and
spacious
room
with
many
windows
a
glazed
cabinet
of
polished
redwood
offered
to
the
eye
a
regiment
of
some
two
hundred
bottles
conspicuously
labelled
these
were
all
charged
with
pinkerton
thirteen
star
although
from
across
the
room
it
would
have
required
an
expert
to
distinguish
them
from
the
same
number
of
bottles
of
courvoisier
i
used
to
twit
my
friend
with
this
resemblance
and
propose
a
new
edition
of
the
pamphlet
with
the
title
thus
improved
drink
french
brandy
when
we
give
you
the
same
labels
the
doors
of
the
cabinet
revolved
all
day
upon
their
hinges
and
if
there
entered
any
one
who
was
a
stranger
to
the
merits
of
the
brand
he
departed
laden
with
a
bottle
when
i
used
to
protest
at
this
extravagance
dear
loudon
pinkerton
would
cry
do
seem
to
catch
on
to
business
principles
the
prime
cost
of
the
spirit
is
literally
nothing
i
could
find
a
cheaper
advertisement
if
i
against
the
side
post
of
the
cabinet
there
leaned
a
gaudy
umbrella
preserved
there
as
a
relic
it
appears
that
when
pinkerton
was
about
to
place
thirteen
star
upon
the
market
the
rainy
season
was
at
hand
he
lay
dark
almost
in
penury
awaiting
the
first
shower
at
which
as
upon
a
signal
the
main
thoroughfares
became
dotted
with
his
agents
vendors
of
advertisements
and
the
whole
world
of
san
francisco
from
the
businessman
fleeing
for
the
to
the
lady
waiting
at
the
corner
for
her
car
sheltered
itself
under
umbrellas
with
this
strange
device
are
you
wet
try
thirteen
star
was
a
mammoth
boom
said
pinkerton
with
a
sigh
of
delighted
recollection
another
umbrella
to
be
seen
i
stood
at
this
window
loudon
feasting
my
eyes
and
i
declare
i
felt
like
and
it
was
to
this
neat
application
of
the
local
climate
that
he
owed
not
only
much
of
the
sale
of
thirteen
star
but
the
whole
business
of
his
advertising
agency
the
large
desk
to
resume
our
survey
of
the
office
stood
about
the
middle
in
stacks
of
handbills
and
posters
of
drink
french
brandy
and
advertiser
it
was
flanked
upon
the
one
hand
by
two
female
who
rested
not
between
the
hours
of
nine
and
four
and
upon
the
other
by
a
model
of
the
agricultural
machine
the
walls
where
they
were
not
broken
by
telephone
boxes
and
a
couple
of
photographs
one
representing
the
wreck
of
the
james
moody
on
a
bold
and
broken
coast
the
other
the
saturday
tug
alive
with
amateur
fishers
almost
disappeared
under
gaudily
framed
many
of
these
were
relics
of
the
latin
quarter
and
i
must
do
pinkerton
the
justice
to
say
that
none
of
them
were
bad
and
some
had
remarkable
merit
they
went
off
slowly
but
for
handsome
figures
and
their
places
were
progressively
supplied
with
the
work
of
local
artists
these
last
it
was
one
of
my
first
duties
to
review
and
criticise
some
of
them
were
villainous
yet
all
were
saleable
i
said
so
and
the
next
moment
saw
myself
the
figure
of
a
miserable
renegade
bearing
arms
in
the
wrong
camp
i
was
to
look
at
pictures
thenceforward
not
with
the
eye
of
the
artist
but
the
dealer
and
i
saw
the
stream
widen
that
divided
me
from
all
i
loved
loudon
pinkerton
had
said
the
morning
after
the
lecture
loudon
we
can
go
at
it
shoulder
to
shoulder
this
is
what
i
have
longed
for
i
wanted
two
heads
and
four
arms
and
now
i
have
you
find
it
just
the
same
as
art
all
observation
and
imagination
only
more
movement
just
wait
till
you
begin
to
feel
the
charm
i
might
have
waited
long
perhaps
i
lack
a
sense
for
our
whole
existence
seemed
to
me
one
dreary
bustle
and
the
place
we
bustled
in
fitly
to
be
called
the
place
of
yawning
i
slept
in
a
little
den
behind
the
office
pinkerton
in
the
office
itself
stretched
on
a
patent
sofa
which
sometimes
collapsed
his
slumbers
still
further
menaced
by
an
imminent
clock
with
an
alarm
roused
by
this
diabolical
contrivance
we
rose
early
went
forth
early
to
breakfast
and
returned
by
nine
to
what
pinkerton
called
work
and
i
distraction
masses
of
letters
must
be
opened
read
and
answered
some
by
me
at
a
subsidiary
desk
which
had
been
introduced
on
the
morning
of
my
arrival
others
by
my
friend
pacing
the
room
like
a
caged
lion
as
he
dictated
to
the
tinkling
masses
of
wet
proof
had
to
be
overhauled
and
scrawled
upon
with
a
blue
pencil
spacing
or
sometimes
terms
more
fervid
as
for
instance
this
which
i
remember
pinkerton
to
have
spirted
on
the
margin
of
an
advertisement
of
soothing
syrup
this
all
down
have
you
never
printed
an
advertisement
i
be
round
in
half
an
the
ledger
and
besides
we
had
always
with
us
such
was
the
backbone
of
our
occupation
and
tolerable
enough
but
the
far
greater
proportion
of
our
time
was
consumed
by
visitors
grand
fellows
no
doubt
and
as
sharp
as
a
needle
but
to
me
unfortunately
not
diverting
some
were
apparently
and
must
be
talked
over
by
the
hour
before
they
could
reach
the
humblest
decision
which
they
only
left
the
office
to
return
again
ten
minutes
later
and
rescind
others
came
with
a
vast
show
of
hurry
and
despatch
but
i
observed
it
to
be
principally
show
the
agricultural
model
for
instance
which
was
practicable
proved
a
kind
of
flypaper
for
these
busybodies
i
have
seen
them
blankly
turn
the
crank
of
it
for
five
minutes
at
a
time
simulating
to
nobody
deception
business
interest
thing
this
pinkerton
sell
much
of
it
ha
could
use
it
i
suppose
as
a
medium
of
advertisement
for
my
article
which
was
perhaps
toilet
soap
others
a
still
worse
variety
carried
us
to
neighbouring
saloons
to
dice
for
cocktails
and
after
the
cocktails
were
paid
for
dollars
on
a
corner
of
the
counter
the
attraction
of
dice
for
all
these
people
was
indeed
extraordinary
at
a
certain
club
where
i
once
dined
in
the
character
of
partner
dodd
the
came
on
the
table
with
the
wine
an
artless
substitute
for
wit
of
all
our
visitors
i
believe
i
preferred
emperor
norton
the
very
mention
of
whose
name
reminds
me
i
am
doing
scanty
justice
to
the
folks
of
san
francisco
in
what
other
city
would
a
harmless
madman
who
supposed
himself
emperor
of
the
two
americas
have
been
so
fostered
and
encouraged
where
else
would
even
the
people
of
the
streets
have
respected
the
poor
soul
illusion
where
else
would
bankers
and
merchants
have
received
his
visits
cashed
his
cheques
and
submitted
to
his
small
assessments
where
else
would
he
have
been
suffered
to
attend
and
address
the
exhibition
days
of
schools
and
colleges
where
else
in
god
green
earth
have
taken
his
pick
of
restaurants
ransacked
the
bill
of
fare
and
departed
scathless
they
tell
me
he
was
even
an
exacting
patron
threatening
to
withdraw
his
custom
when
dissatisfied
and
i
can
believe
it
for
his
face
wore
an
expression
distinctly
gastronomical
pinkerton
had
received
from
this
monarch
a
cabinet
appointment
i
have
seen
the
brevet
wondering
mainly
at
the
good
nature
of
the
printer
who
had
executed
the
forms
and
i
think
my
friend
was
at
the
head
either
of
foreign
affairs
or
education
it
mattered
indeed
nothing
the
presentation
being
in
all
offices
identical
it
was
at
a
comparatively
early
date
that
i
saw
jim
in
the
exercise
of
his
public
functions
his
majesty
entered
the
office
a
portly
rather
flabby
man
with
the
face
of
a
gentleman
rendered
unspeakably
pathetic
and
absurd
by
the
great
sabre
at
his
side
and
the
peacock
feather
in
his
hat
have
called
to
remind
you
pinkerton
that
you
are
somewhat
in
arrear
of
taxes
he
said
with
stately
courtesy
your
majesty
what
is
the
amount
asked
jim
and
when
the
figure
was
named
it
was
generally
two
or
three
dollars
paid
upon
the
nail
and
offered
a
bonus
in
the
shape
of
thirteen
star
am
always
delighted
to
patronise
native
industries
said
norton
the
first
francisco
is
in
what
concerns
its
emperor
and
indeed
sir
of
all
my
domains
it
is
my
favourite
said
i
when
he
was
gone
prefer
that
customer
to
the
really
rather
a
distinction
jim
admitted
think
it
must
have
been
the
umbrella
racket
that
attracted
we
were
distinguished
under
the
rose
by
the
notice
of
other
and
greater
men
there
were
days
when
jim
wore
an
air
of
unusual
capacity
and
resolve
spoke
with
more
brevity
like
one
pressed
for
time
and
took
often
on
his
tongue
such
phrases
as
told
me
so
this
morning
or
had
it
straight
from
longhurst
it
was
no
wonder
i
used
to
think
that
pinkerton
was
called
to
council
with
such
titans
for
the
creature
quickness
and
resource
were
beyond
praise
in
the
early
days
when
he
consulted
me
without
reserve
pacing
the
room
projecting
ciphering
extending
hypothetical
interests
trebling
imaginary
capital
his
to
renew
an
excellent
old
word
labouring
full
steam
ahead
i
could
never
decide
whether
my
sense
of
respect
or
entertainment
were
the
stronger
but
these
good
hours
were
destined
to
curtailment
it
smart
enough
i
once
observed
pinkerton
do
you
think
it
honest
do
think
it
honest
he
wailed
dear
me
that
ever
i
should
have
heard
such
an
expression
on
your
lips
at
sight
of
his
distress
i
plagiarised
unblushingly
from
myner
seem
to
think
honesty
as
simple
as
blind
man
buff
said
i
a
more
delicate
affair
than
that
delicate
as
any
well
at
that
rate
he
exclaimed
with
complete
relief
am
perfectly
certain
of
one
thing
that
what
you
propose
is
dishonest
i
returned
say
no
more
about
it
that
settled
he
replied
thus
almost
at
a
word
my
point
was
carried
but
the
trouble
was
that
such
differences
continued
to
recur
until
we
began
to
regard
each
other
with
alarm
if
there
were
one
thing
pinkerton
valued
himself
upon
it
was
his
honesty
if
there
were
one
thing
he
clung
to
it
was
my
good
opinion
and
when
both
were
involved
as
was
the
case
in
these
commercial
cruces
the
man
was
on
the
rack
my
own
position
if
you
consider
how
much
i
owed
him
how
hateful
is
the
trade
of
and
that
yet
i
lived
and
fattened
on
these
questionable
operations
was
perhaps
equally
distressing
if
i
had
been
more
sterling
or
more
combative
things
might
have
gone
extremely
far
but
in
truth
i
was
just
base
enough
to
profit
by
what
was
not
forced
on
my
attention
rather
than
seek
scenes
pinkerton
quite
cunning
enough
to
avail
himself
of
my
weakness
and
it
was
a
relief
to
both
when
he
began
to
involve
his
proceedings
in
a
decent
mystery
our
last
dispute
which
had
a
most
consequence
turned
on
the
refitting
of
condemned
ships
he
had
bought
a
miserable
hulk
and
came
rubbing
his
hands
to
inform
me
she
was
already
on
the
slip
under
a
new
name
to
be
repaired
when
first
i
had
heard
of
this
industry
i
suppose
i
scarcely
comprehended
but
much
discussion
had
sharpened
my
faculties
and
now
my
brow
became
heavy
can
be
no
party
to
that
pinkerton
said
i
he
leaped
like
a
man
shot
next
he
cried
ails
you
anyway
you
seem
to
me
to
dislike
everything
that
ship
has
been
condemned
by
lloyd
agent
said
i
i
tell
you
it
a
deal
the
ship
in
splendid
condition
there
next
to
nothing
wrong
with
her
but
the
garboard
streak
and
the
sternpost
i
tell
you
lloyd
is
a
ring
like
everybody
else
only
an
english
ring
and
that
what
deceives
you
if
it
was
american
you
would
be
crying
it
down
all
day
it
anglomania
common
anglomania
he
cried
with
growing
irritation
will
not
make
money
by
risking
men
lives
was
my
ultimatum
caesar
is
all
speculation
a
risk
is
the
fairest
kind
of
shipowning
to
risk
men
lives
and
mining
how
that
for
risk
and
look
at
the
elevator
business
there
danger
if
you
like
did
i
take
my
risk
when
i
bought
her
she
might
have
been
too
far
gone
and
where
would
i
have
been
loudon
he
cried
tell
you
the
truth
you
too
full
of
refinement
for
this
world
condemn
you
out
of
your
own
lips
i
replied
fairest
kind
of
shipowning
says
you
if
you
please
let
us
only
do
the
fairest
kind
of
the
shot
told
the
irrepressible
was
silenced
and
i
profited
by
the
chance
to
pour
in
a
broadside
of
another
sort
he
was
all
sunk
in
i
pointed
out
he
never
dreamed
of
anything
but
dollars
where
were
all
his
generous
progressive
sentiments
where
was
his
culture
i
asked
and
where
was
the
american
type
true
loudon
he
cried
striding
up
and
down
the
room
and
wildly
scouring
at
his
hair
perfectly
right
i
becoming
materialised
o
what
a
thing
to
have
to
say
what
a
confession
to
make
materialised
me
loudon
this
must
go
on
no
longer
you
been
a
loyal
friend
to
me
once
more
give
me
your
hand
you
saved
me
again
i
must
do
something
to
rouse
the
spiritual
side
something
desperate
study
something
something
dry
and
tough
what
shall
it
be
theology
algebra
what
algebra
dry
and
tough
enough
said
i
squared
b
stimulating
though
he
inquired
i
told
him
i
believed
so
and
that
it
was
considered
fortifying
to
types
that
the
thing
for
me
i
study
algebra
he
concluded
the
next
day
by
application
to
one
of
his
women
he
got
word
of
a
young
lady
one
miss
mamie
mcbride
who
was
willing
and
able
to
conduct
him
in
these
bloomless
meadows
and
her
circumstances
being
lean
and
terms
consequently
moderate
he
and
mamie
were
soon
in
agreement
for
two
lessons
in
the
week
he
took
fire
with
unexampled
rapidity
he
seemed
unable
to
tear
himself
away
from
the
symbolic
art
an
hour
lesson
occupied
the
whole
evening
and
the
original
two
was
soon
increased
to
four
and
then
to
five
i
bade
him
beware
of
female
blandishments
first
thing
you
know
you
be
falling
in
love
with
the
algebraist
said
i
say
it
even
in
jest
he
cried
a
lady
i
revere
i
could
no
more
lay
a
hand
upon
her
than
i
could
upon
a
spirit
loudon
i
believe
god
ever
made
a
which
appeared
to
me
too
fervent
to
be
reassuring
meanwhile
i
had
been
long
expostulating
with
my
friend
upon
a
different
matter
the
fifth
wheel
i
kept
telling
him
any
use
i
am
i
might
as
well
be
in
senegambia
the
letters
you
give
me
to
attend
to
might
be
answered
by
a
sucking
child
and
i
tell
you
what
it
is
pinkerton
either
you
got
to
find
me
some
employment
or
i
have
to
start
in
and
find
it
for
this
i
said
with
a
corner
of
my
eye
in
the
usual
quarter
toward
the
arts
little
dreaming
what
destiny
was
to
provide

i

a

the

singular
how
a
man
runs
from

to
charybdis
i
was
so
intent
on
securing
the
disappearance
of
a
single
epithet
that
i
accepted
the
rest
of
the
advertisement
and
all
that
it
involved
without
discussion
so
it
befell
that
the
words
were
deleted
but
that
loudon
dodd
became
manager
and
honorary
steward
of
hebdomadary
picnics
soon
shortened
by
popular
consent
to
the
dromedary
by
eight
any
sunday
morning
i
was
to
be
observed
by
an
admiring
public
on
the
wharf
the
garb
and
attributes
of
sacrifice
consisted
of
a
black
frock
coat
rosetted
its
pockets
bulging
with
sweetmeats
and
inferior
cigars
trousers
of
light
blue
a
silk
hat
like
a
reflector
and
a
varnished
wand
a
goodly
steamer
guarded
my
one
flank
panting
and
throbbing
flags
fluttering
fore
and
aft
of
her
illustrative
of
the
dromedary
and
patriotism
my
other
flank
was
covered
by
the
strongly
held
by
a
trusty
character
of
the
scots
persuasion
rosetted
like
his
superior
and
smoking
a
cigar
to
mark
the
occasion
festive
at
having
assured
myself
that
all
was
well
with
the
free
luncheons
i
lit
a
cigar
myself
and
awaited
the
strains
of
the
i
had
never
to
wait
long
they
were
german
and
punctual
and
by
a
few
minutes
after
the
i
would
hear
them
booming
down
street
with
a
long
military
roll
of
drums
some
score
of
gratuitous
asses
prancing
at
the
head
in
bearskin
hats
and
buckskin
aprons
and
conspicuous
with
resplendent
axes
the
band
of
course
we
paid
for
but
so
strong
is
the
san
franciscan
passion
for
public
masquerade
that
the
asses
as
i
say
were
all
gratuitous
pranced
for
the
love
of
it
and
cost
us
nothing
but
their
luncheon
the
musicians
formed
up
in
the
bows
of
my
steamer
and
struck
into
a
skittish
polka
the
asses
mounted
guard
upon
the
gangway
and
the
and
presently
after
in
family
parties
of
father
mother
and
children
in
the
form
of
duplicate
lovers
or
in
that
of
solitary
youth
the
public
began
to
descend
upon
us
by
the
carful
at
a
time
four
to
six
hundred
perhaps
with
a
strong
german
flavour
and
all
merry
as
children
when
these
had
been
shepherded
on
board
and
the
inevitable
belated
two
or
three
had
gained
the
deck
amidst
the
cheering
of
the
public
the
hawser
was
cast
off
and
we
plunged
into
the
bay
and
now
behold
the
honorary
steward
in
hour
of
duty
and
glory
see
me
circulate
amid
crowd
radiating
affability
and
laughter
liberal
with
my
sweetmeats
and
cigars
i
say
unblushing
things
to
hobbledehoy
girls
tell
shy
young
persons
this
is
the
married
people
boat
roguishly
ask
the
abstracted
if
they
are
thinking
of
their
sweethearts
offer
paterfamilias
a
cigar
am
struck
with
the
beauty
and
grow
curious
about
the
age
of
mamma
youngest
who
i
assure
her
gaily
will
be
a
man
before
his
mother
or
perhaps
it
may
occur
to
me
from
the
sensible
expression
of
her
face
that
she
is
a
person
of
good
counsel
and
i
ask
her
earnestly
if
she
knows
any
particularly
pleasant
place
on
the
saucelito
or
san
rafael
coast
for
the
scene
of
our
picnic
is
always
supposed
to
be
uncertain
the
next
moment
i
am
back
at
my
giddy
badinage
with
the
young
ladies
wakening
laughter
as
i
go
and
leaving
in
my
wake
applausive
comments
of
dodd
a
funny
gentleman
and
i
think
he
just
too
nice
an
hour
having
passed
in
this
airy
manner
i
start
upon
my
rounds
afresh
with
a
bag
full
of
coloured
tickets
all
with
pins
attached
and
all
with
legible
inscriptions
germany
love
fogies
belle
france
erin
land
of
cakes
jay
twenty
of
each
denomination
for
when
it
comes
to
the
luncheon
we
sit
down
by
twenties
these
are
distributed
with
anxious
tact
for
indeed
this
is
the
most
delicate
part
of
my
functions
but
outwardly
with
reckless
unconcern
amidst
the
gayest
flutter
and
confusion
and
are
immediately
after
sported
upon
hats
and
bonnets
to
the
extreme
diffusion
of
cordiality
total
strangers
hailing
each
other
by
number
of
their
so
we
humorously
name
it
and
the
deck
ringing
with
cries
of
all
blue
jays
to
the
rescue
or
say
am
i
alone
in
this
blame
ship
ai
there
no
more
californians
by
this
time
we
are
drawing
near
to
the
appointed
spot
i
mount
upon
the
bridge
the
observed
of
all
observers
i
say
in
clear
emphatic
tones
heard
far
and
wide
majority
of
the
company
appear
to
be
in
favour
of
the
little
cove
beyond
one
tree
right
dodd
responds
the
captain
heartily
one
to
me
i
am
not
exactly
sure
of
the
place
you
mean
but
just
you
stay
here
and
pilot
i
do
pointing
with
my
wand
i
do
pilot
him
to
the
inexpressible
entertainment
of
the
picnic
for
i
am
why
should
i
deny
it
the
popular
man
we
slow
down
off
the
mouth
of
a
grassy
valley
watered
by
a
brook
and
set
in
pines
and
redwoods
the
anchor
is
let
go
the
boats
are
lowered
two
of
them
already
packed
with
the
materials
of
an
impromptu
bar
and
the
pioneer
band
accompanied
by
the
resplendent
asses
fill
the
other
and
move
shoreward
to
the
inviting
strains
of
buffalo
gals
wo
you
come
out
it
is
a
part
of
our
programme
that
one
of
the
asses
shall
from
sheer
clumsiness
in
the
course
of
this
embarkation
drop
a
dummy
axe
into
the
water
whereupon
the
mirth
of
the
picnic
can
hardly
be
assuaged
upon
one
occasion
the
dummy
axe
floated
and
the
laugh
turned
rather
the
wrong
way
in
from
ten
to
twenty
minutes
the
boats
are
again
the
messes
are
marshalled
separately
on
the
deck
and
the
picnic
goes
ashore
to
find
the
band
and
the
impromptu
bar
awaiting
them
then
come
the
hampers
which
are
piled
upon
the
beach
and
surrounded
by
a
stern
guard
of
stalwart
asses
axe
on
shoulder
it
is
here
i
take
my
place
in
hand
under
a
banner
bearing
the
legend
here
for
each
hamper
contains
a
complete
outfit
for
a
separate
twenty
cold
provender
plates
glasses
knives
forks
and
spoons
an
agonized
printed
appeal
from
the
fevered
pen
of
pinkerton
pasted
on
the
inside
of
the
lid
beseeches
that
care
be
taken
of
the
glass
and
silver
beer
wine
and
lemonade
are
flowing
already
from
the
bar
and
the
various
clans
of
twenty
file
away
into
the
woods
with
bottles
under
their
arms
and
the
hampers
strung
upon
a
stick
till
one
they
feast

in
a
very
moderate
seclusion

being
within
earshot
of
the
band
from
one
till
four
dancing
takes
place
upon
the
grass
the
bar
does
a
roaring
business
and
the
honorary
steward
who
has
already
exhausted
himself
to
bring
life
into
the
dullest
of
the
messes
must
now
indefatigably
dance
with
the
plainest
of
the
women
at
four
a

and
by
behold
us
on

all
while
the
honorary

free
at
last
subsides
into
the
captain
cabin
over
a
brandy
and
soda
and
a
book
free
at
last
i
say
yet
there
remains
before
him
the
frantic
at
the
pier
and
a
sober
journey
up
to
pinkerton
office
with
two
policemen
and
the
day
takings
in
a
bag
what
i
have
here
sketched
was
the
routine
but
we
appealed
to
the
taste
of
san
francisco
more
distinctly
in
particular
fetes
olde
time
largely
advertised
in
beginning
oyez
and
largely
frequented
by
knights
monks
and
cavaliers
was
drowned
out
by
unseasonable
rain
and
returned
to
the
city
one
of
the
saddest
spectacles
i
ever
remember
to
have
witnessed
in
pleasing
contrast
and
certainly
our
chief
success
was
gathering
of
the
clans
or
scottish
picnic
so
many
knees
were
never
before
simultaneously
exhibited
in
public
and
to
judge
by
the
prevalence
of
and
the
number
of
eagle
feathers
we
were
a
company
i
threw
forward
the
scottish
flank
of
my
own
ancestry
and
passed
muster
as
a
clansman
with
applause
there
was
indeed
but
one
small
cloud
on
this
day
i
had
laid
in
a
large
supply
of
the
national
beverage
in
the
shape
of
the
roy
macgregor
blend
warranted
old
and
vatted
and
this
must
certainly
have
been
a
generous
spirit
for
i
had
some
anxious
work
between
four
and
conveying
on
board
the
inanimate
forms
of
chieftains
to
one
of
our
ordinary
festivities
where
he
was
the
life
and
soul
of
his
own
mess
pinkerton
himself
came
incognito
bringing
the
algebraist
on
his
arm
miss
mamie
proved
to
be
a
mouse
with
a
large
limpid
eye
very
good
manners
and
a
flow
of
the
most
correct
expressions
i
have
ever
heard
upon
the
human
lip
as
incognito
was
strict
i
had
little
opportunity
to
cultivate
the
acquaintance
but
i
was
informed
afterwards
that
she
considered
me
wittiest
gentleman
she
had
ever
lord
mend
your
taste
in
wit
thought
i
but
i
can
not
conceal
that
such
was
the
general
impression
one
of
my
pleasantries
even
went
the
round
of
san
francisco
and
i
have
heard
it
myself
all
unknown
bandied
in
saloons
to
be
unknown
began
at
last
to
be
a
rare
experience
a
bustle
woke
upon
my
passage
above
all
in
humble
neighbourhoods
that
one
would
ask
and
the
other
would
cry
why
dromedary
dodd
or
with
withering
scorn
know
dodd
of
the
picnics
well
and
indeed
i
think
it
marked
a
rather
barren
destiny
for
our
picnics
if
a
trifle
vulgar
were
as
gay
and
innocent
as
the
age
of
gold
i
am
sure
no
people
divert
themselves
so
easily
and
so
well
and
even
with
the
cares
of
my
stewardship
i
was
often
happy
to
be
there
indeed
there
were
but
two
drawbacks
in
the
least
considerable
the
first
was
my
terror
of
the
hobbledehoy
girls
to
whom
from
the
demands
of
my
situation
i
was
obliged
to
lay
myself
so
open
the
other
if
less
momentous
was
more
mortifying
in
early
days
at
my
mother
knee
as
a
man
may
say
i
had
acquired
the
unenviable
accomplishment
which
i
have
never
since
been
able
to
lose
of
singing
before
the
i
have
what
the
french
call
a
fillet
of
voice
my
best
notes
scarce
audible
about
a
and
the
upper
register
rather
to
be
regarded
as
a
higher
power
of
silence
experts
tell
me
besides
that
i
sing
flat
nor
if
i
were
the
best
singer
in
the
world
does
before
the
occur
to
my
mature
taste
as
the
song
that
i
would
choose
to
sing
in
spite
of
all
which
considerations
at
one
picnic
memorably
dull
and
after
i
had
exhausted
every
other
art
of
pleasing
i
gave
in
desperation
my
one
song
from
that
hour
my
doom
was
gone
forth
either
we
had
a
chronic
passenger
though
i
could
never
detect
him
or
the
very
wood
and
iron
of
the
steamer
must
have
retained
the
tradition
at
every
successive
picnic
word
went
round
that
dodd
was
a
singer
that
dodd
sang
before
the
and
finally
that
now
was
the
time
when
dodd
sang
before
the
battle
so
that
the
thing
became
a
fixture
like
the
dropping
of
the
dummy
axe
and
you
are
to
conceive
me
sunday
after
sunday
piping
up
my
lamentable
ditty
and
covered
when
it
was
done
with
gratuitous
applause
it
is
a
beautiful
trait
in
human
nature
that
i
was
invariably
offered
an
encore
i
was
well
paid
however
even
to
sing
pinkerton
and
i
after
an
average
sunday
had
five
hundred
dollars
to
divide
nay
and
the
picnics
were
the
means
although
indirectly
of
bringing
me
a
singular
windfall
this
was
at
the
end
of
the
season
after
the
farewell
fancy
dress
many
of
the
hampers
had
suffered
severely
and
it
was
judged
wiser
to
save
storage
dispose
of
them
and
lay
in
a
fresh
stock
when
the
campaign
among
my
purchasers
was
a
workingman
of
the
name
of
speedy
to
whose
house
after
several
unavailing
letters
i
must
proceed
in
person
wondering
to
find
myself
once
again
on
the
wrong
side
and
playing
the
creditor
to
some
one
else
debtor
speedy
was
in
the
belligerent
stage
of
fear
he
could
not
pay
it
appeared
he
had
already
resold
the
hampers
and
he
defied
me
to
do
my
worst
i
did
not
like
to
lose
my
own
money
i
hated
to
lose
pinkerton
and
the
bearing
of
my
creditor
incensed
me
you
know
mr
speedy
that
i
can
send
you
to
the
penitentiary
said
i
willing
to
read
him
a
lesson
the
dire
expression
was
overheard
in
the
next
room
a
large
fresh
motherly
irishwoman
ran
forth
upon
the
instant
and
fell
to
besiege
me
with
caresses
and
appeals
now
and
ye
could
have
the
heart
to
ut
dodd
you
that
so
well
known
to
be
a
pleasant
gentleman
and
it
a
pleasant
face
ye
have
and
the
picture
of
me
own
brother
dead
and
gone
it
a
truth
that
he
been
drinking
ye
can
smell
it
off
of
him
more
blame
to
him
but
indade
and
there
nothing
in
the
house
beyont
the
furnicher
and
thim
stock
it
the
stock
that
be
taking
dear
a
sore
penny
it
has
cost
me
first
and
last
and
by
all
tales
not
worth
an
owld
tobacco
thus
adjured
and
somewhat
embarrassed
by
the
stern
attitude
i
had
adopted
i
suffered
myself
to
be
invested
with
a
considerable
quantity
of
what
is
called
stock
in
which
this
excellent
if
illogical
female
had
been
squandering
her
gold
it
could
scarce
be
said
to
better
my
position
but
the
step
quieted
the
woman
and
on
the
other
hand
i
could
not
think
i
was
taking
much
risk
for
the
shares
in
question
they
were
those
of
what
i
will
call
the
catamount
silver
mine
had
fallen
some
time
before
to
the
quotation
and
now
lay
perfectly
inert
or
were
only
kicked
like
other
waste
paper
about
the
kennel
of
the
exchange
by
bankrupt
speculators
a
month
or
two
after
i
perceived
by
the
that
catamount
had
taken
a
bound
before
afternoon
were
worth
a
quite
considerable
pot
of
money
and
i
learned
upon
inquiry
that
a
bonanza
had
been
found
in
a
condemned
lead
and
the
mine
was
now
expected
to
do
wonders
remarkable
to
philosophers
how
bonanzas
are
found
in
condemned
leads
and
how
the
stock
is
always
at
immediately
before
by
some
stroke
of
chance
the
speedys
had
held
on
to
the
right
thing
they
had
escaped
the
syndicate
yet
a
little
more
if
i
had
not
come
to
dun
them
and
mrs
speedy
would
have
been
buying
a
silk
dress
i
could
not
bear
of
course
to
profit
by
the
accident
and
returned
to
offer
restitution
the
house
was
in
a
bustle
the
neighbours
all
themselves
had
crowded
to
condole
and
mrs
speedy
sat
with
streaming
tears
the
centre
of
a
sympathetic
group
fifteen
year
i
been
at
ut
she
was
lamenting
as
i
entered
grudging
the
babes
the
very
milk
more
shame
to
me
to
pay
their
dhirty
assessments
and
now
my
dears
i
should
be
a
lady
and
driving
in
my
coach
if
all
had
their
rights
and
a
sorrow
on
that
man
dodd
as
soon
as
i
set
eyes
on
him
i
seen
the
divil
was
in
the
it
was
upon
these
words
that
i
made
my
entrance
which
was
therefore
dramatic
enough
though
nothing
to
what
followed
for
when
it
appeared
that
i
was
come
to
restore
the
lost
fortune
and
when
mrs
speedy
after
copiously
weeping
on
my
bosom
had
refused
the
restitution
and
when
mr
speedy
summoned
to
that
end
from
a
camp
of
the
grand
army
of
the
republic
had
added
his
refusal
and
when
i
had
insisted
and
they
had
insisted
and
the
neighbours
had
applauded
and
supported
each
of
us
in
turn
and
when
at
last
it
was
agreed
we
were
to
hold
the
stock
together
and
share
the
proceeds
in
three
parts
one
for
me
one
for
mr
speedy
and
one
for
his
spouse
i
will
leave
you
to
conceive
the
enthusiasm
that
reigned
in
that
small
bare
apartment
with
the
in
the
one
corner
and
the
babes
asleep
in
the
other
and
pictures
of
garfield
and
the
battle
of
gettysburg
on
the
yellow
walls
port
wine
was
had
in
by
a
sympathiser
and
we
drank
it
mingled
with
tears
i
dhrink
to
your
health
my
dear
sobbed
mrs
speedy
especially
affected
by
my
gallantry
in
the
matter
of
the
third
share
sure
we
all
dhrink
to
his
health
dodd
of
the
picnics
no
gentleman
better
known
than
him
and
it
my
prayer
dear
the
good
god
may
be
long
spared
to
see
ye
in
health
and
happiness
in
the
end
i
was
the
chief
gainer
for
i
sold
my
third
while
it
was
worth
five
thousand
dollars
but
the
speedys
more
adventurously
held
on
until
the
syndicate
reversed
the
process
when
they
were
happy
to
escape
with
perhaps
a
quarter
of
that
sum
it
was
just
as
well
for
the
bulk
of
the
money
was
in
pinkerton
phrase
reinvested
and
when
next
i
saw
mrs
speedy
she
was
still
gorgeously
dressed
from
the
proceeds
of
the
late
success
but
was
already
moist
with
tears
over
the
new
catastrophe
froze
out
me
darlin
all
the
money
we
had
dear
and
the
and
jim
uniform
was
in
the
golden
west
and
the
vipers
has
put
on
a
new
by
the
end
of
the
year
therefore
this
is
how
i
stood
i
had
made
by
catamount
silver
mine
by
the
picnics
by
the
lecture
by
profit
and
loss
on
capital
in
pinkerton
business
to
which
must
be
added
what
remained
of
my
donation
it
appears
on
the
other
hand
that
i
had
spent
which
thus
left
me
to
the
good
a
result
on
which
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
i
looked
with
gratitude
and
pride
some
eight
thousand
being
late
conquest
was
liquid
and
actually
tractile
in
the
bank
the
rest
whirled
beyond
reach
and
even
sight
save
in
the
mirror
of
a
under
the
compelling
spell
of
wizard
pinkerton
dollars
of
mine
were
tacking
off
the
shores
of
mexico
in
peril
of
the
deep
and
the
they
rang
on
in
the
city
of
tombstone
arizona
they
shone
in
among
the
mountain
diggings
the
imagination
flagged
in
following
them
so
wide
were
they
diffused
so
briskly
they
span
to
the
turning
of
the
crank
but
here
there
or
everywhere
i
could
still
tell
myself
it
was
all
mine
and
what
was
more
convincing
draw
substantial
dividends
my
fortune
i
called
it
and
it
represented
when
expressed
in
dollars
or
even
british
pounds
an
honest
pot
of
money
when
extended
into
francs
a
veritable
fortune
perhaps
i
have
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
perhaps
you
see
already
where
my
hopes
were
pointing
and
begin
to
blame
my
inconsistency
but
i
must
first
tell
you
my
excuse
and
the
change
that
had
befallen
pinkerton
about
a
week
after
the
picnic
to
which
he
escorted
mamie
pinkerton
avowed
the
state
of
his
affections
from
what
i
had
observed
on
board
the
steamer
where
methought
mamie
waited
on
him
with
her
limpid
eyes
i
encouraged
the
bashful
lover
to
proceed
and
the
very
next
evening
he
was
carrying
me
to
call
on
his
affianced
must
befriend
her
loudon
as
you
have
always
befriended
me
he
said
pathetically
saying
disagreeable
things
i
doubt
if
that
be
the
way
to
a
young
lady
favour
i
replied
since
this
picnicking
i
begin
to
be
a
man
of
some
you
do
nobly
there
i
ca
describe
how
i
admire
you
he
cried
that
she
will
ever
need
it
she
has
had
every
advantage
god
knows
what
i
have
done
to
deserve
her
o
man
what
a
responsibility
this
is
for
a
rough
fellow
and
not
always
truthful
up
old
man
brace
up
said
i
but
when
we
reached
mamie
it
was
almost
with
tears
that
he
presented
me
is
loudon
mamie
were
his
words
want
you
to
love
him
he
has
a
grand
are
certainly
no
stranger
to
me
dodd
was
her
gracious
expression
is
never
weary
of
descanting
on
your
dear
lady
said
i
you
know
our
friend
a
little
better
you
will
make
a
large
allowance
for
his
warm
heart
my
goodness
has
consisted
in
allowing
him
to
feed
and
clothe
and
toil
for
me
when
he
could
ill
afford
it
if
i
am
now
alive
it
is
to
him
i
owe
it
no
man
had
a
kinder
friend
you
must
take
good
care
of
him
i
added
laying
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
keep
him
in
good
order
for
he
needs
pinkerton
was
much
affected
by
this
speech
and
so
i
fear
was
mamie
i
admit
it
was
a
tactless
performance
you
know
our
friend
a
little
better
was
not
happily
said
and
even
him
in
good
order
for
he
needs
might
be
construed
into
matter
of
offence
but
i
lay
it
before
you
in
all
confidence
of
your
acquittal
was
the
general
tone
of
it
even
if
such
was
the
verdict
of
the
lady
i
can
not
but
suppose
the
blame
was
neither
wholly
hers
nor
wholly
mine
i
can
not
but
suppose
that
pinkerton
had
already
sickened
the
poor
woman
of
my
very
name
so
that
if
i
had
come
with
the
songs
of
apollo
she
must
still
have
been
disgusted
here
however
were
two
to
paris
jim
was
going
to
be
married
and
so
had
the
less
need
of
my
society
i
had
not
pleased
his
bride
and
so
was
perhaps
better
absent
late
one
evening
i
broached
the
idea
to
my
friend
it
had
been
a
great
day
for
me
i
had
just
banked
my
five
thousand
catamountain
dollars
and
as
jim
had
refused
to
lay
a
finger
on
the
stock
risk
and
profit
were
both
wholly
mine
and
i
was
celebrating
the
event
with
stout
and
crackers
i
began
by
telling
him
that
if
it
caused
him
any
pain
or
any
anxiety
about
his
affairs
he
had
but
to
say
the
word
and
he
should
hear
no
more
of
my
proposal
he
was
the
truest
and
best
friend
i
ever
had
or
was
ever
like
to
have
and
it
would
be
a
strange
thing
if
i
refused
him
any
favour
he
was
sure
he
wanted
at
the
same
time
i
wished
him
to
be
sure
for
my
life
was
wasting
in
my
hands
i
was
like
one
from
home
all
my
true
interests
summoned
me
away
i
must
remind
him
besides
that
he
was
now
about
to
marry
and
assume
new
interests
and
that
our
extreme
familiarity
might
be
even
painful
to
his
no
loudon
i
feel
you
are
wrong
there
he
interjected
warmly
does
appreciate
your
so
much
the
better
then
i
continued
and
went
on
to
point
out
that
our
separation
need
not
be
for
long
that
in
the
way
affairs
were
going
he
might
join
me
in
two
years
with
a
fortune
small
indeed
for
the
states
but
in
france
almost
conspicuous
that
we
might
unite
our
resources
and
have
one
house
in
paris
for
the
winter
and
a
second
near
fontainebleau
for
summer
where
we
could
be
as
happy
as
the
day
was
long
and
bring
up
little
pinkertons
as
practical
artistic
workmen
far
from
the
of
the
west
me
go
then
i
concluded
as
a
deserter
but
as
the
vanguard
to
lead
the
march
of
the
pinkerton
so
i
argued
and
pleaded
not
without
emotion
my
friend
sitting
opposite
resting
his
chin
upon
his
hand
and
but
for
that
single
interjection
silent
have
been
looking
for
this
loudon
said
he
when
i
had
done
does
pain
me
and
that
the
fact
i
so
miserably
selfish
and
i
believe
it
a
death
blow
to
the
picnics
for
it
idle
to
deny
that
you
were
the
heart
and
soul
of
them
with
your
wand
and
your
gallant
bearing
and
wit
and
humour
and
chivalry

for

count
on

forty

you
shall

two

i
shake

you

with
mamie
on

we
talked
in
this
vein
far
into
the

i
was
myself
so
exultant
in
my
liberty
and
pinkerton
so
proud
of
my
triumph
so
happy
in
my
happiness
in
so
warm
a
glow
about
the
gallant
little
woman
of
his
choice
and
the
very
room
so
filled
with
castles
in
the
air
and
cottages
at
fontainebleau
that
it
was
little
wonder
if
sleep
fled
our
eyelids
and
three
had
followed
two
upon
the
office
clock
before
pinkerton
unfolded
the
mechanism
of

it
is
very
much
the
custom
to
view
life
as
if
it
were
exactly
ruled
in

the

side
of
my
career
in

has
been
now
disposed
of
i
approach
the
chapter
of
diversion
and
it
will
be
found
they
had
about
an
equal
share
in
building
up
the
story
of
the
wrecker
a
gentleman
whose
appearance
may
be
presently
expected
with
all
my
occupations
some
six
afternoons
and
two
or
three
odd
evenings
remained
at
my
disposal
every
week
a
circumstance
the
more
agreeable
as
i
was
a
stranger
in
a
city
singularly
picturesque
from
what
i
had
once
called
myself
the
amateur
parisian
i
grew
or
declined
into
a
waterside
prowler
a
lingerer
on
wharves
a
frequenter
of
shy
neighbourhoods
a
scraper
of
acquaintance
with
eccentric
characters
i
visited
chinese
and
mexican
german
secret
societies
sailors
and
of
every
complexion
of
the
disreputable
and
dangerous
i
have
seen
greasy
mexican
hands
pinned
to
the
table
with
a
knife
for
cheating
seamen
when
ran
high
knocked
down
upon
the
public
street
and
carried
insensible
on
board
ships
shots
exchanged
and
the
smoke
and
the
company
dispersing
from
the
doors
of
the
saloon
i
have
heard
polacks
debate
upon
the
readiest
method
of
burning
san
francisco
to
the
ground
working
men
and
women
bawl
and
swear
in
the
tribune
at
the
sandlot
and
kearney
himself
open
his
subscription
for
a
gallows
name
the
manufacturers
who
were
to
grace
it
with
their
dangling
bodies
and
read
aloud
to
the
delighted
multitude
a
telegram
of
adhesion
from
a
member
of
the
state
legislature
all
which
preparations
of
proletarian
war
were
in
a
moment
breathed
upon
and
abolished
by
the
mere
name
and
fame
of
coleman
that
lion
of
the
vigilantes
had
but
to
rouse
himself
and
shake
his
ears
and
the
whole
brawling
mob
was
silenced
i
could
not
but
reflect
what
a
strange
manner
of
man
this
was
to
be
living
unremarked
there
as
a
private
merchant
and
to
be
so
feared
by
a
whole
city
and
if
i
was
disappointed
in
my
character
of
to
have
the
matter
end
ingloriously
without
the
firing
of
a
shot
or
the
hanging
of
a
single
millionnaire
philosophy
tried
to
tell
me
that
this
sight
was
truly
the
more
picturesque
in
a
thousand
towns
and
different
epochs
i
might
have
had
occasion
to
behold
the
cowardice
and
carnage
of
street
fighting
where
else
but
only
there
and
then
could
i
have
enjoyed
a
view
of
coleman
the
intermittent
despot
walking
meditatively
up
hill
in
a
quiet
part
of
town
with
a
very
rolling
gait
and
slapping
gently
his
great
thigh
minora
canamus
this
historic
figure
stalks
silently
through
a
corner
of
the
san
francisco
of
my
memory
the
rest
is
the
reminiscences
of
a
vagrant
sketcher
my
delight
was
much
in
slums
little
italy
was
a
haunt
of
mine
there
i
would
look
in
at
the
windows
of
small
transported
bodily
from
genoa
or
naples
with
their
macaroni
and
chianti
flasks
and
portraits
of
garibaldi
and
coloured
political
caricatures
or
entering
in
hold
high
debate
with
some
fisher
of
the
bay
as
to
the
designs
of
and
i
was
often
to
be
observed
had
there
been
any
to
observe
me
in
that
solitude
of
little
mexico
with
its
crazy
wooden
houses
endless
crazy
wooden
stairs
and
perilous
mountain
in
the
sand
chinatown
by
a
thousand
eccentricities
drew
and
held
me
i
could
never
have
enough
of
its
ambiguous
interracial
atmosphere
as
of
a
vitalised
museum
never
wonder
enough
at
its
outlandish
vegetables
set
forth
to
sell
in
commonplace
american
its
temple
doors
open
and
the
scent
of
the
streaming
forth
on
the
american
air
its
kites
of
oriental
fashion
hanging
fouled
in
western
its
flights
of
paper
prayers
which
the
hunts
and
dissipates
along
western
gutters
i
was
a
frequent
wanderer
on
north
beach
gazing
at
the
straits
and
the
huge
creeping
out
to
sea
and
imminent
tamalpais
thence
on
my
homeward
way
i
might
visit
that
strange
and
filthy
shed
and
walled
with
the
cages
of
wild
animals
and
birds
where
at
a
ramshackle
counter
amid
the
yells
of
monkeys
and
a
poignant
atmosphere
of
menagerie
whiskey
was
administered
by
a
proprietor
as
dirty
as
his
beasts
nor
did
i
even
neglect
nob
hill
which
is
itself
a
kind
of
slum
being
the
habitat
of
the
mere
millionnaire
there
they
dwell
upon
the
high
raised
above
man
clamour
and
the
blows
between
their
palaces
about
deserted
streets
but
san
francisco
is
not
herself
only
she
is
not
only
the
most
interesting
city
in
the
union
and
the
hugest
of
races
and
the
precious
metals
she
keeps
besides
the
doors
of
the
pacific
and
is
the
port
of
entry
to
another
world
and
an
earlier
epoch
in
history
nowhere
else
shall
you
observe
in
the
ancient
phrase
so
many
tall
ships
as
here
convene
from
round
the
horn
from
china
from
sydney
and
the
indies
but
scarce
remarked
amid
that
crowd
of
giants
another
class
of
craft
the
island
schooner
circulates
low
in
the
water
with
lofty
spars
and
dainty
lines
rigged
and
fashioned
like
a
yacht
manned
with
native
sailors
and
equipped
with
their
great
boats
that
tell
a
tale
of
boisterous
these
steal
out
and
in
again
unnoted
by
the
world
or
even
the
newspaper
press
save
for
the
line
in
the
clearing
column
for
yap
and
south
sea
steal
out
with
nondescript
cargoes
of
tinned
salmon
gin
bolts
of
gaudy
cotton
stuff
women
hats
and
waterbury
watches
to
return
after
a
year
piled
as
high
as
to
the
eaves
of
the
house
with
copra
or
wallowing
deep
with
the
shells
of
the
tortoise
or
the
pearl
oyster
to
me
in
my
character
of
the
amateur
parisian
this
island
traffic
and
even
the
island
world
were
beyond
the
bounds
of
curiosity
and
how
much
more
of
knowledge
i
stood
there
on
the
extreme
shore
of
the
west
and
of
seventeen
hundred
years
ago
and
seven
thousand
miles
to
the
east
a
legionary
stood
perhaps
upon
the
wall
of
antoninus
and
looked
northward
toward
the
mountains
of
the
picts
for
all
the
interval
of
time
and
space
i
when
i
looked
from
the
on
the
broad
pacific
was
that
man
heir
and
analogue
each
of
us
standing
on
the
verge
of
the
roman
empire
or
as
we
now
call
it
western
civilization
each
of
us
gazing
onward
into
zones
unromanised
but
i
was
dull
i
looked
rather
backward
keeping
a
kind
eye
on
paris
and
it
required
a
series
of
converging
incidents
to
change
my
attitude
of
nonchalance
for
one
of
interest
and
even
longing
which
i
little
dreamed
that
i
should
live
to
gratify
the
first
of
these
incidents
brought
me
in
acquaintance
with
a
certain
san
francisco
character
who
had
something
of
a
name
beyond
the
limits
of
the
city
and
was
known
to
many
lovers
of
good
english
i
had
discovered
a
new
slum
a
place
of
precarious
sandy
cliffs
deep
sandy
cuttings
solitary
ancient
houses
and
the
of
streets
it
was
already
environed
the
ranks
of
the
threaded
it
unbroken
the
city
upon
all
sides
of
it
was
tightly
packed
and
growled
with
traffic
i
do
not
doubt
the
very
landmarks
are
all
swept
away
but
it
offered
then
within
narrow
limits
a
delightful
peace
and
in
the
morning
when
i
chiefly
went
there
a
seclusion
almost
rural
on
a
steep
in
this
neighbourhood
toppled
on
the
most
insecure
foundation
a
certain
row
of
houses
each
with
a
bit
of
garden
and
all
i
have
to
presume
inhabited
thither
i
used
to
mount
by
a
crumbling
footpath
and
in
front
of
the
last
of
the
houses
would
sit
down
to
sketch
the
very
first
day
i
saw
i
was
observed
out
of
the
window
by
a
youngish
fellow
prematurely
bald
and
with
an
expression
both
lively
and
engaging
the
second
as
we
were
still
the
only
figures
in
the
landscape
it
was
no
more
than
natural
that
we
should
nod
the
third
he
came
out
fairly
from
his
intrenchments
praised
my
sketch
and
with
the
impromptu
cordiality
of
artists
carried
me
into
his
apartment
where
i
sat
presently
in
the
midst
of
a
museum
of
strange
objects
paddles
and
and
baskets
stone
images
ornaments
of
threaded
shell
cocoanut
bowls
snowy
cocoanut
plumes
evidences
and
examples
of
another
earth
another
climate
another
race
and
another
if
a
ruder
culture
nor
did
these
objects
lack
a
fitting
commentary
in
the
conversation
of
my
new
acquaintance
doubtless
you
have
read
his
book
you
know
already
how
he
tramped
and
starved
and
had
so
fine
a
profit
of
living
in
his
days
among
the
islands
and
meeting
him
as
i
did
one
artist
with
another
after
months
of
offices
and
picnics
you
can
imagine
with
what
charm
he
would
speak
and
with
what
pleasure
i
would
hear
it
was
in
such
talks
which
we
were
both
eager
to
repeat
that
i
first
heard
the
names
first
fell
under
the
spell
of
the
islands
and
it
was
from
one
of
the
first
of
them
that
i
returned
a
happy
man
with
under
one
arm
and
my
friend
own
adventures
under
the
other
the
second
incident
was
more
dramatic
and
had
besides
a
bearing
on
my
future
i
was
standing
one
day
near
a
under
telegraph
hill
a
large
barque
perhaps
of
eighteen
hundred
tons
was
coming
more
than
usually
close
about
the
point
to
reach
her
moorings
and
i
was
observing
her
with
languid
inattention
when
i
observed
two
men
to
stride
across
the
bulwarks
drop
into
a
shore
boat
and
violently
dispossessing
the
boatman
of
his
oars
pull
toward
the
landing
where
i
stood
in
a
surprisingly
short
time
they
came
tearing
up
the
steps
and
i
could
see
that
both
were
too
well
dressed
to
be
foremast
hands
the
first
even
with
research
and
both
and
specially
the
first
appeared
under
the
empire
of
some
strong
emotion
police
office
cried
the
leader
way
said
i
immediately
falling
in
with
their
precipitate
pace
wrong
what
ship
is
that
the
gleaner
he
replied
am
chief
officer
this
third
and
we
to
get
in
our
depositions
before
the
crew
you
see
they
might
corral
us
with
the
captain
and
that
no
kind
of
berth
for
me
i
sailed
with
some
hard
cases
in
my
time
and
seen
pins
flying
like
sand
on
a
squally
day
but
never
a
match
to
our
old
man
it
never
let
up
from
the
hook
to
the
farallones
and
the
last
man
was
dropped
not
sixteen
hours
ago
packet
rats
our
men
were
and
as
tough
a
crowd
as
ever
a
man
head
in
but
they
looked
sick
enough
when
the
captain
started
in
with
his
fancy
he
done
up
observed
the
other
wo
go
to
sea
no
make
me
tired
retorted
his
superior
he
gets
ashore
in
one
piece
and
is
lynched
in
the
next
ten
minutes
he
do
yet
the
owners
have
a
longer
memory
than
the
public
they
stand
by
him
they
do
find
as
smart
a
captain
every
day
in
the
he
a
son
of
a
gun
of
a
fine
captain
there
ai
no
doubt
of
that
concurred
the
other
heartily
i
do
suppose
there
been
no
wages
paid
aboard
that
gleaner
for
three
wages
i
exclaimed
for
i
was
still
a
novice
in
maritime
affairs
to
before
the
mast
agreed
the
mate
cleared
out
was
the
soft
job
they
maybe
took
it
for
she
isn
the
first
ship
that
never
paid
i
could
not
but
observe
that
our
pace
was
progressively
relaxing
and
indeed
i
have
often
wondered
since
whether
the
hurry
of
the
start
were
not
intended
for
the
gallery
alone
certain
it
is
at
least
that
when
we
had
reached
the
police
office
and
the
mates
had
made
their
deposition
and
told
their
horrid
tale
of
five
men
murdered
some
with
savage
passion
some
with
cold
brutality
between
sandy
hook
and
san
francisco
the
police
were
despatched
in
time
to
be
too
late
before
we
arrived
the
ruffian
had
slipped
out
upon
the
dock
had
mingled
with
the
crowd
and
found
a
refuge
in
the
house
of
an
acquaintance
and
the
ship
was
only
tenanted
by
his
late
victims
well
for
him
that
he
had
been
thus
speedy
for
when
word
began
to
go
abroad
among
the
characters
when
the
last
victim
was
carried
by
to
the
hospital
when
those
who
had
escaped
as
by
miracle
from
that
floating
shambles
began
to
circulate
and
show
their
wounds
in
the
crowd
it
was
strange
to
witness
the
agitation
that
seized
and
shook
that
portion
of
the
city
men
shed
tears
in
public
bosses
of
long
inured
to
brutality
and
above
all
brutality
to
sailors
shook
their
fists
at
heaven
if
hands
could
have
been
laid
on
the
captain
of
the
gleaner
his
shrift
would
have
been
short
that
night
so
gossip
reports
he
was
headed
up
in
a
barrel
and
smuggled
across
the
bay
in
two
ships
already
he
had
braved
the
penitentiary
and
the
gallows
and
yet
by
last
accounts
he
now
commands
another
on
the
western
ocean
as
i
have
said
i
was
never
quite
certain
whether
nares
the
mate
did
not
intend
that
his
superior
should
escape
it
would
have
been
like
his
preference
of
loyalty
to
law
it
would
have
been
like
his
prejudice
which
was
all
in
favour
of
the
but
it
must
remain
a
matter
of
conjecture
only
well
as
i
came
to
know
him
in
the
sequel
he
was
never
communicative
on
that
point
nor
indeed
on
any
that
concerned
the
voyage
of
the
gleaner
doubtless
he
had
some
reason
for
his
reticence
even
during
our
walk
to
the
police
office
he
debated
several
times
with
johnson
the
third
officer
whether
he
ought
not
to
give
up
himself
as
well
as
to
denounce
the
captain
he
had
decided
in
the
negative
arguing
that
would
probably
come
to
nothing
and
even
if
there
was
a
stink
he
had
plenty
good
friends
in
san
and
to
nothing
it
came
though
it
must
have
very
nearly
come
to
something
for
nares
disappeared
immediately
from
view
and
was
scarce
less
closely
hidden
than
his
captain
johnson
on
the
other
hand
i
often
met
i
could
never
learn
this
country
and
though
he
himself
claimed
to
be
american
neither
his
english
nor
his
education
warranted
the
claim
in
all
likelihood
he
was
of
scandinavian
birth
and
blood
long
pickled
in
the
forecastles
of
english
and
american
ships
it
is
possible
that
like
so
many
of
his
race
in
similar
positions
he
had
already
lost
his
native
tongue
in
mind
at
least
he
was
quite
denationalised
thought
only
in
english
to
call
it
so
and
though
by
nature
one
of
the
mildest
kindest
and
most
feebly
playful
of
mankind
he
had
been
so
long
accustomed
to
the
cruelty
of
sea
discipline
that
his
stories
told
perhaps
with
a
giggle
would
sometimes
turn
me
chill
in
appearance
he
was
tall
light
of
weight
bold
and
of
feature
and
with
a
face
of
a
clean
even
brown
the
ornament
of
outdoor
men
seated
in
a
chair
you
might
have
passed
him
off
for
a
baronet
or
a
military
officer
but
let
him
rise
and
it
was
jack
that
came
rolling
toward
you
let
him
but
open
his
lips
and
it
was
jack
that
piped
and
drawled
his
ungrammatical
gibberish
he
had
sailed
among
other
places
much
among
the
islands
and
after
a
cape
horn
passage
with
its
and
its
frozen
sheets
he
announced
his
intention
of
a
turn
among
them
i
thought
i
should
have
lost
him
soon
but
according
to
the
unwritten
usage
of
mariners
he
had
first
to
dissipate
his
wages
i
have
to
paint
this
town
red
was
his
hyperbolical
expression
for
sure
no
man
ever
embarked
upon
a
milder
course
of
dissipation
most
of
his
days
being
passed
in
the
little
parlour
behind
black
tom
public
house
with
a
select
corps
of
old
particular
acquaintances
all
from
the
south
seas
and
all
patrons
of
a
long
yarn
a
short
pipe
and
glasses
round
black
tom
to
the
front
presented
the
appearance
of
a
saloon
devoted
to
kanaka
seamen
dirt
negrohead
tobacco
bad
cigars
worse
gin
and
guitars
and
banjos
in
a
state
of
decline
the
proprietor
a
powerful
coloured
man
was
at
once
a
publican
a
ward
politician
leader
of
some
brigade
of
or
at
the
wind
of
whose
clubs
the
party
bosses
and
the
mayor
were
supposed
to
tremble
and
what
hurt
nothing
an
active
and
reliable
crimp
his
front
quarters
then
were
noisy
disreputable
and
not
even
safe
i
have
seen
worse
frequented
saloons
where
there
were
fewer
scandals
for
tom
was
often
drunk
himself
and
there
is
no
doubt
the
lambs
must
have
been
a
useful
body
or
the
place
would
have
been
closed
i
remember
one
day
not
long
before
an
election
seeing
a
blind
man
very
well
dressed
led
up
to
the
counter
and
remain
a
long
while
in
consultation
with
the
negro
the
pair
looked
so
and
the
awe
with
which
the
drinkers
fell
back
and
left
them
in
the
midst
of
an
impromptu
privacy
was
so
unusual
in
such
a
place
that
i
turned
to
my
next
neighbour
with
a
question
he
told
me
the
blind
man
was
a
distinguished
party
boss
called
by
some
the
king
of
san
francisco
but
perhaps
better
known
by
his
picturesque
chinese
nickname
of
the
blind
white
devil
lambs
must
be
wanted
pretty
bad
i
guess
my
informant
added
i
have
here
a
sketch
of
the
blind
white
devil
leaning
on
the
counter
on
the
next
page
and
taken
the
same
hour
a
jotting
of
black
tom
threatening
a
whole
crowd
of
customers
with
a
long
smith
and
wesson
to
such
heights
and
depths
we
rose
and
fell
in
the
front
parts
of
the
saloon
meanwhile
away
in
the
back
quarters
sat
the
small
informal
south
sea
club
talking
of
another
world
and
surely
of
a
different
century
old
schooner
captains
they
were
old
south
sea
traders
cooks
and
mates
fine
creatures
softened
by
residence
among
a
softer
race
full
men
besides
though
not
by
reading
but
by
strange
experience
and
for
days
together
i
could
hear
their
yarns
with
an
unfading
pleasure
all
had
indeed
some
touch
of
the
poetic
for
the
when
not
a
mere
ruffian
is
the
poor
relation
of
the
artist
even
through
inarticulate
speech
his
yes
there
ai
no
harm
in
them
kanakas
or
yes
that
a
son
of
a
gun
of
a
fine
island
mountainious
right
down
i
did
never
ought
to
have
left
that
island
there
pierced
a
certain
gusto
of
appreciation
and
some
of
the
rest
were
from
their
long
tales
their
traits
of
character
and
unpremeditated
landscape
there
began
to
piece
itself
together
in
my
head
some
image
of
the
islands
and
the
island
life
precipitous
shores
spired
mountain
tops
the
deep
shade
of
hanging
forests
the
unresting
surf
upon
the
reef
and
the
unending
peace
of
the
lagoon
sun
moon
and
stars
of
an
imperial
brightness
man
moving
in
these
scenes
scarce
fallen
and
woman
lovelier
than
eve
the
primal
curse
abrogated
the
bed
made
ready
for
the
stranger
life
set
to
perpetual
music
and
the
guest
welcomed
the
boat
urged
and
the
long
night
beguiled
with
poetry
and
choral
song
a
man
must
have
been
an
unsuccessful
artist
he
must
have
starved
on
the
streets
of
paris
he
must
have
been
yoked
to
a
commercial
force
like
pinkerton
before
he
can
conceive
the
longings
that
at
times
assailed
me
the
draughty
rowdy
city
of
san
francisco
the
bustling
office
where
my
friend
jim
paced
like
a
caged
lion
daily
between
ten
and
four
even
at
times
the
retrospect
of
paris
faded
in
comparison
many
a
man
less
tempted
would
have
thrown
up
all
to
realise
his
visions
but
i
was
by
nature
unadventurous
and
uninitiative
to
divert
me
from
all
former
paths
and
send
me
cruising
through
the
isles
of
paradise
some
force
external
to
myself
must
be
exerted
destiny
herself
must
use
the
fitting
wedge
and
little
as
i
deemed
it
that
tool
was
already
in
her
hand
of
brass
i
sat
one
afternoon
in
the
corner
of
a
great
glassy
silvered
saloon
a
free
lunch
at
my
one
elbow
at
the
other
a
from
the
brush
of
local
talent
when
with
the
tramp
of
feet
and
a
sudden
buzz
of
voices
the
were
flung
broadly
open
and
the
place
carried
as
by
storm
the
crowd
which
thus
entered
mostly
seafaring
men
and
all
prodigiously
excited
contained
a
sort
of
kernel
or
general
centre
of
interest
which
the
rest
merely
surrounded
and
advertised
as
children
in
the
old
world
surround
and
escort
the
man
the
word
went
round
the
bar
like
wildfire
that
these
were
captain
trent
and
the
survivors
of
the
british
brig
flying
scud
picked
up
by
a
british
on
midway
island
arrived
that
morning
in
san
francisco
bay
and
now
fresh
from
making
the
necessary
declarations
presently
i
had
a
good
sight
of
them
four
brown
seamanlike
fellows
standing
by
the
counter
glass
in
hand
the
centre
of
a
score
of
questioners
one
was
a
kanaka
the
cook
i
was
informed
one
carried
a
cage
with
a
canary
which
occasionally
trilled
into
thin
song
one
had
his
left
arm
in
a
sling
and
looked
gentlemanlike
and
somewhat
sickly
as
though
the
injury
had
been
severe
and
he
was
scarce
recovered
and
the
captain
himself
a
thickset
man
of
five
and
forty
wore
a
bandage
on
his
right
hand
the
incident
struck
me
i
was
struck
particularly
to
see
captain
cook
and
foremost
hands
walking
the
street
and
visiting
saloons
in
company
and
as
when
anything
impressed
me
i
got
my
out
and
began
to
steal
a
sketch
of
the
four
castaways
the
crowd
sympathising
with
my
design
made
a
clear
lane
across
the
room
and
i
was
thus
enabled
all
unobserved
myself
to
observe
with
a
closeness
the
face
and
the
demeanour
of
captain
trent
warmed
by
whiskey
and
encouraged
by
the
eagerness
of
the
bystanders
that
gentleman
was
now
rehearsing
the
history
of
his
misfortune
it
was
but
scraps
that
reached
me
how
he
her
on
the
starboard
tack
and
how
came
up
sudden
out
of
the
and
she
was
high
and
sometimes
he
would
appeal
to
one
of
the
men
was
how
it
was
jack
and
the
man
would
reply
was
the
way
of
it
captain
lastly
he
started
a
fresh
tide
of
popular
sympathy
by
enunciating
the
sentiment
all
these
admirality
charts
and
what
i
say
from
the
nodding
of
heads
and
the
murmurs
of
assent
that
followed
i
could
see
that
captain
trent
had
established
himself
in
the
public
mind
as
a
gentleman
and
a
thorough
navigator
about
which
period
my
sketch
of
the
four
men
and
the
being
finished
and
all
especially
the
excellent
likenesses
i
buckled
up
my
book
and
slipped
from
the
saloon
little
did
i
suppose
that
i
was
leaving
act
i
scene
i
of
the
drama
of
my
life
and
yet
the
scene
or
rather
the
captain
face
lingered
for
some
time
in
my
memory
i
was
no
prophet
as
i
say
but
i
was
something
else
i
was
an
observer
and
one
thing
i
knew
i
knew
when
a
man
was
terrified
captain
trent
of
the
british
brig
flying
scud
had
been
glib
he
had
been
ready
he
had
been
loud
but
in
his
blue
eyes
i
could
detect
the
chill
and
in
the
lines
of
his
countenance
spy
the
agitation
of
perpetual
terror
was
he
trembling
for
his
certificate
in
my
judgment
it
was
some
livelier
kind
of
fear
that
thrilled
in
the
marrow
as
he
turned
to
drink
was
it
the
result
of
recent
shock
and
had
he
not
yet
recovered
the
disaster
to
his
brig
i
remembered
how
a
friend
of
mine
had
been
in
a
railway
accident
and
shook
and
started
for
a
month
and
although
captain
trent
of
the
flying
scud
had
none
of
the
appearance
of
a
nervous
man
i
told
myself
with
incomplete
conviction
that
his
must
be
a
similar
case
chapter
ix
the
wreck
of
the
the
next
morning
i
found
pinkerton
who
had
risen
before
me
seated
at
our
usual
table
and
deep
in
the
perusal
of
what
i
will
call
the
this
was
a
paper
i
know
not
if
it
be
so
still
that
stood
out
alone
among
its
brethren
in
the
west
the
others
down
to
their
smallest
item
were
defaced
with
capitals
alliterations
swaggering
misquotations
and
the
shoddy
picturesque
and
unpathetic
pathos
of
the
harry
millers
the
alone
appeared
to
be
written
by
a
dull
sane
christian
gentleman
singly
desirous
of
communicating
knowledge
it
had
not
only
this
merit
which
endeared
it
to
me
but
was
admittedly
the
best
informed
on
business
matters
which
attracted
pinkerton
said
he
looking
up
from
the
journal
sometimes
think
i
have
too
many
irons
in
the
fire
my
notion
on
the
other
hand
is
when
you
see
a
dollar
lying
pick
it
up
well
here
i
tumbled
over
a
whole
pile
of
on
a
reef
in
the
middle
of
the
jim
you
miserable
fellow
i
exclaimed
we
depew
city
one
of
god
green
centres
for
this
state
have
we
listen
to
this
interrupted
jim
miserable
copy
these
reporter
fellows
have
no
fire
but
the
facts
are
right
enough
i
and
he
began
to
read
of
the
british
brig
scud
tempest
which
arrived
yesterday
at
this
port
brings
captain
trent
and
four
men
of
the
british
brig
flying
scud
cast
away
february
on
midway
island
and
most
providentially
rescued
the
next
day
the
flying
scud
was
of
tons
burthen
owned
in
london
and
has
been
out
nearly
two
years
tramping
captain
trent
left

december
bound
for
this
port
in
rice
and
a
small
mixed
cargo
of
silks
teas
and
china
notions
the
whole
valued
at
fully
covered
by

the
log
shows
plenty

and
squalls
in

going
rotten
and
misled
by
hoyt
pacific
which
informed
him
there
was
a
coaling
station
on
the
island
captain
trent
put
in
to
midway
island
he
found
it
a
literal
sandbank
surrounded
by
a
coral
reef
mostly
submerged
birds
were
very
plenty
there
was
good
fish
in
the
lagoon
but
no
firewood
and
the
water
which
could
be
obtained
by
digging
brackish
he
found
good
off
the
north
end
of
the
larger
bank
in
fifteen
fathoms
water
bottom
sandy
with
coral
patches
here
he
was
detained
seven
days
by
a
calm
the
crew
suffering
severely
from
the
water
which
was
gone
quite
bad
and
it
was
only
on
the
evening
of
the
that
a
little
wind
sprang
up
coming
puffy
out
of
late
as
it
was
captain
trent
immediately
weighed
anchor
and
attempted
to
get
out
while
the
vessel
was
beating
up
to
the
passage
the
wind
took
a
sudden
lull
and
then
veered
squally
into
and
even
driving
the
brig
ashore
on
the
sand
at
about
twenty
minutes
before
six
john
wallen
a
native
of
finland
and
charles
holdorsen
a
native
of
sweden
were
drowned
alongside
in
attempting
to
lower
a
boat
neither
being
able
to
swim
the
squall
very
dark
and
the
noise
of
the
breakers
drowning
everything
at
the
same
time
john
brown
another
of
the
crew
had
his
arm
broken
by
the
falls
captain
trent
further
informed
the
occidental
reporter
that
the
brig
struck
heavily
at
first
bows
on
he
supposes
upon
coral
that
she
then
drove
over
the
obstacle
and
now
lies
in
sand
much
down
by
the
head
and
with
a
list
to
starboard
in
the
first
collision
she
must
have
sustained
some
damage
as
she
was
making
water
forward
the
rice
will
probably
be
all
destroyed
but
the
more
valuable
part
of
the
cargo
is
fortunately
in
the
afterhold
captain
trent
was
preparing
his
for
sea
when
the
providential
arrival
of
the
tempest
pursuant
to
admiralty
orders
to
call
at
islands
in
her
course
for
castaways
saved
the
gallant
captain
from
all
further
danger
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
add
that
both
the
officers
and
men
of
the
unfortunate
vessel
speak
in
high
terms
of
the
kindness
they
received

the

at

later
in
the
afternoon
the
occidental
reporter
found
lieutenant
sebright
first
officer
of
tempest
at
the
palace
hotel
the
gallant
officer
was
somewhat
pressed
for
time
but
confirmed
the
account
given
by
captain
trent
in
all
particulars
he
added
that
the
flying
scud
is
in
an
excellent
berth
and
except
in
the
highly
improbable
event
of
a
heavy
gale
might
last
until
next
will
never
know
anything
of
literature
said
i
when
jim
had
finished
is
a
good
honest
plain
piece
of
work
and
tells
the
story
clearly
i
see
only
one
mistake
the
cook
is
not
a
chinaman
he
is
a
kanaka
and
i
think
a
how
do
you
know
that
asked
jim
saw
the
whole
gang
yesterday
in
a
saloon
said
i
even
heard
the
tale
or
might
have
heard
it
from
captain
trent
himself
who
struck
me
as
thirsty
and
that
neither
here
nor
there
cried
pinkerton
point
is
how
about
these
dollars
lying
on
a
reef
it
pay
i
asked
like
a
sugar
trust
exclaimed
pinkerton
you
see
what
this
british
officer
says
about
the
safety
do
you
see
the
cargo
valued
at
ten
thousand
schooners
are
begging
just
now
i
can
get
my
pick
of
them
at
two
hundred
and
fifty
a
month
and
how
does
that
foot
up
it
looks
like
three
hundred
per
cent
to
forget
i
objected
captain
himself
declares
the
rice
is
a
point
i
know
admitted
jim
the
rice
is
the
sluggish
article
anyway
it
little
more
account
than
ballast
it
the
tea
and
silks
that
i
look
to
all
we
have
to
find
is
the
proportion
and
one
look
at
the
manifest
will
settle
that
i
rung
up
lloyd
on
purpose
the
captain
is
to
meet
me
there
in
an
hour
and
then
i
be
as
posted
on
that
brig
as
if
i
built
her
besides
you
no
idea
what
pickings
there
are
about
a
wreck
copper
lead
rigging
anchors
chains
even
the
crockery
loudon
seem
to
me
to
forget
one
trifle
said
i
you
pick
that
wreck
you
got
to
buy
her
and
how
much
will
she
cost
hundred
dollars
replied
jim
with
the
promptitude
of
an
automaton
on
earth
do
you
guess
that
i
cried
do
guess
i
know
it
answered
the
commercial
force
dear
boy
i
may
be
a
galoot
about
literature
but
you
always
be
an
outsider
in
business
how
do
you
suppose
i
bought
the
james
moody
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
her
boats
alone
worth
four
times
the
money
because
my
name
stood
first
in
the
list
well
it
stands
there
again
i
have
the
naming
of
the
figure
and
i
name
a
small
one
because
of
the
distance
but
it
would
matter
what
i
named
that
would
be
the
sounds
mysterious
enough
said
i
this
public
auction
conducted
in
a
subterranean
vault
could
a
plain
citizen
myself
for
instance
come
and
see
everything
open
and
above
board
he
cried
indignantly
can
come
only
nobody
bids
against
us
and
if
he
did
he
would
get
frozen
out
it
been
tried
before
now
and
once
was
enough
we
hold
the
plant
we
got
the
connection
we
can
afford
to
go
higher
than
any
outsider
there
two
million
dollars
in
the
ring
and
we
stick
at
nothing
or
suppose
anybody
did
buy
over
our
head
i
tell
you
loudon
he
would
think
this
town
gone
crazy
he
could
no
more
get
business
through
on
the
city
front
than
i
can
dance
schooners
divers
men
all
he
wanted
the
prices
would
fly
right
up
and
strike
how
did
you
get
in
i
asked
were
once
an
outsider
like
your
neighbours
i
suppose
took
hold
of
that
thing
loudon
and
just
studied
it
up
he
replied
took
my
fancy
it
was
so
romantic
and
then
i
saw
there
was
boodle
in
the
thing
and
i
figured
on
the
business
till
no
man
alive
could
give
me
points
nobody
knew
i
had
an
eye
on
wrecks
till
one
fine
morning
i
dropped
in
upon
douglas
longhurst
in
his
den
gave
him
all
the
facts
and
figures
and
put
it
to
him
straight
you
want
me
in
this
ring
or
shall
i
start
another
he
took
half
an
hour
and
when
i
came
back
says
he
put
your
name
on
the
first
time
i
came
to
the
top
it
was
that
moody
racket
now
it
the
flying
whereupon
pinkerton
looking
at
his
watch
uttered
an
exclamation
made
a
hasty
appointment
with
myself
for
the
doors
of
the
exchange
and
fled
to
examine
manifests
and
interview
the
skipper
i
finished
my
cigarette
with
the
deliberation
of
a
man
at
the
end
of
many
picnics
reflecting
to
myself
that
of
all
forms
of
the
dollar
hunt
this
wrecking
had
by
far
the
most
address
to
my
imagination
even
as
i
went
down
town
in
the
brisk
bustle
and
chill
of
the
familiar
san
francisco
thoroughfares
i
was
haunted
by
a
vision
of
the
wreck
baking
so
far
away
in
the
strong
sun
under
a
cloud
of
and
even
then
and
for
no
better
reason
my
heart
inclined
towards
the
adventure
if
not
myself
something
that
was
mine
some
one
at
least
in
my
employment
should
voyage
to
that
and
descend
to
that
deserted
cabin
pinkerton
met
me
at
the
appointed
moment
pinched
of
lip
and
more
than
usually
erect
of
bearing
like
one
conscious
of
great
resolves
i
asked
said
he
might
be
better
and
it
might
be
worse
this
captain
trent
is
a
remarkably
honest
fellow
one
out
of
a
thousand
as
soon
as
he
knew
i
was
in
the
market
he
owned
up
about
the
rice
in
so
many
words
by
his
calculation
if
there
thirty
mats
of
it
saved
an
outside
figure
however
the
manifest
was
cheerier
there
about
five
thousand
dollars
of
the
whole
value
in
silks
and
teas
and
and
that
all
in
the
lazarette
and
as
safe
as
if
it
was
in
kearney
street
the
brig
was
new
coppered
a
year
ago
there
upwards
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
fathom
chain
it
not
a
bonanza
but
boodle
in
it
and
we
try
it
it
was
by
that
time
hard
on
ten
and
we
turned
at
once
into
the
place
of
sale
the
flying
scud
although
so
important
to
ourselves
appeared
to
attract
a
very
humble
share
of
popular
attention
the
auctioneer
was
surrounded
by
perhaps
a
score
of
big
fellows
for
the
most
part
of
the
true
western
build
long
in
the
leg
broad
in
the
shoulder
and
adorned
to
a
plain
man
taste
with
needless
finery
a
jaunty
ostentatious
comradeship
prevailed
bets
were
flying
and
nicknames
as
they
would
have
called
themselves
were
very
boyish
and
it
was
plain
they
were
here
in
mirth
and
not
on
business
behind
and
certainly
in
strong
contrast
to
these
gentlemen
i
could
detect
the
figure
of
my
friend
captain
trent
come
as
i
could
very
well
imagine
that
a
captain
would
to
hear
the
last
of
his
old
vessel
since
yesterday
he
had
rigged
himself
anew
in
black
clothes
not
very
aptly
fitted
the
upper
pocket
showing
a
corner
of
silk
handkerchief
the
lower
on
the
other
side
bulging
with
papers
pinkerton
had
just
given
this
man
a
high
character
certainly
he
seemed
to
have
been
very
frank
and
i
looked
at
him
again
to
trace
if
possible
that
virtue
in
his
face
it
was
red
and
broad
and
flustered
and
i
thought
false
the
whole
man
looked
sick
with
some
unknown
anxiety
and
as
he
stood
there
unconscious
of
my
observation
he
tore
at
his
nails
scowled
on
the
floor
or
glanced
suddenly
sharply
and
fearfully
at
i
was
still
gazing
at
the
man
in
a
kind
of
fascination
when
the
sale
began
some
preliminaries
were
rattled
through
to
the
irreverent
uninterrupted
gambolling
of
the
boys
and
then
amid
a
trifle
more
attention
the
auctioneer
sounded
for
some
two
or
three
minutes
the
pipe
of
the
charmer
fine
brig
new
copper
valuable
fittings
three
fine
boats
remarkably
choice
cargo
what
the
auctioneer
would
call
a
perfectly
safe
investment
nay
gentlemen
he
would
go
further
he
would
put
a
figure
on
it
he
had
no
hesitation
had
that
bold
auctioneer
in
putting
it
in
figures
and
in
his
view
what
with
this
and
that
and
one
thing
and
another
the
purchaser
might
expect
to
clear
a
sum
equal
to
the
entire
estimated
value
of
the
cargo
or
gentlemen
in
other
words
a
sum
of
ten
thousand
dollars
at
this
modest
computation
the
roof
immediately
above
the
speaker
head
i
suppose
through
the
intervention
of
a
spectator
of
ventriloquial
tastes
uttered
a
clear
whereat
all
laughed
the
auctioneer
himself
obligingly
joining
gentlemen
what
shall
we
say
resumed
that
gentleman
plainly
ogling
pinkerton
shall
we
say
for
this
remarkable
opportunity
hundred
dollars
said
pinkerton
hundred
dollars
from
pinkerton
went
the
auctioneer
hundred
dollars
no
other
gentleman
inclined
to
make
any
advance
one
hundred
dollars
only
one
hundred
dollars
the
auctioneer
was
droning
on
to
some
such
tune
as
this
and
i
on
my
part
was
watching
with
something
between
sympathy
and
amazement
the
undisguised
emotion
of
captain
trent
when
we
were
all
startled
by
the
interjection
of
a
bid
fifty
said
a
sharp
voice
pinkerton
the
auctioneer
and
the
boys
who
were
all
equally
in
the
open
secret
of
the
ring
were
now
all
equally
and
simultaneously
taken
aback
beg
your
pardon
said
the
auctioneer
bid
fifty
reiterated
the
voice
which
i
was
now
able
to
trace
to
its
origin
on
the
lips
of
a
small
unseemly
rag
of
the
speaker
skin
was
gray
and
blotched
he
spoke
in
a
kind
of
broken
song
with
much
variety
of
key
his
gestures
seemed
as
in
the
disease
called
saint
vitus
dance
to
be
imperfectly
under
control
he
was
badly
dressed
he
carried
himself
with
an
air
of
shrinking
assumption
as
though
he
were
proud
to
be
where
he
was
and
to
do
what
he
was
doing
and
yet
half
expected
to
be
called
in
question
and
kicked
out
i
think
i
never
saw
a
man
more
of
a
piece
and
the
type
was
new
to
me
i
had
never
before
set
eyes
upon
his
parallel
and
i
thought
instinctively
of
balzac
and
the
lower
regions
of
the
pinkerton
stared
a
moment
on
the
intruder
with
no
friendly
eye
tore
a
leaf
from
his
and
scribbled
a
line
in
pencil
turned
beckoned
a
messenger
boy
and
whispered
next
moment
the
boy
had
sped
upon
his
errand
and
pinkerton
was
again
facing
the
auctioneer
hundred
dollars
said
jim
fifty
said
the
enemy
looks
lively
whispered
i
to
pinkerton
the
little
beast
means
cold
drawn
biz
returned
my
friend
he
have
to
have
a
lesson
wait
till
i
see
longhurst
three
hundred
he
added
aloud
fifty
came
the
echo
it
was
about
this
moment
when
my
eye
fell
again
on
captain
trent
a
deeper
shade
had
mounted
to
his
crimson
face
the
new
coat
was
unbuttoned
and
all
flying
open
the
new
silk
handkerchief
in
busy
requisition
and
the
man
eye
of
a
clear
sailor
blue
shone
glassy
with
excitement
he
was
anxious
still
but
now
if
i
could
read
a
face
there
was
hope
in
his
anxiety
i
whispered
at
trent
bet
you
what
you
please
he
was
expecting
was
the
reply
some
blame
thing
going
on
and
he
renewed
his
bid
the
figure
had
run
up
into
the
neighbourhood
of
a
thousand
when
i
was
aware
of
a
sensation
in
the
faces
opposite
and
looking
over
my
shoulder
saw
a
very
large
bland
handsome
man
come
strolling
forth
and
make
a
little
signal
to
the
auctioneer
word
borden
said
he
and
then
to
jim
pink
where
are
we
up
to
now
pinkerton
gave
him
the
figure
ran
up
to
that
on
my
own
responsibility
longhurst
he
added
with
a
flush
thought
it
the
square
so
it
was
said
longhurst
patting
him
kindly
on
the
shoulder
like
a
gratified
uncle
you
can
drop
out
now
we
take
hold
ourselves
you
can
run
it
up
to
five
thousand
and
if
he
likes
to
go
beyond
that
he
welcome
to
the
the
by
who
is
he
asked
pinkerton
looks
away
sent
billy
to
find
and
at
the
very
moment
longhurst
received
from
the
hands
of
one
of
the
expensive
young
gentlemen
a
folded
paper
it
was
passed
round
from
one
to
another
till
it
came
to
me
and
i
read
bellairs
defended
clara
varden
twice
nearly
that
gets
me
observed
longhurst
can
have
put
up
a
shyster
like
that
nobody
with
money
that
a
sure
thing
suppose
you
tried
a
big
bluff
i
think
i
would
pink
well
your
partner
dodd
happy
to
have
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
and
the
great
man
withdrew
a
low
lawyer
what
do
you
think
of
douglas
whispered
pinkerton
looking
reverently
after
him
as
he
departed
foot
of
perfect
gentleman
and
culture
to
his
during
this
interview
the
auction
had
stood
transparently
arrested
the
auctioneer
the
spectators
and
even
bellairs
all
well
aware
that
longhurst
was
the
principal
and
jim
but
a
but
now
that
the
olympian
jupiter
was
gone
borden
thought
proper
to
affect
severity
come
pinkerton
any
advance
he
snapped
and
pinkerton
resolved
on
the
big
bluff
replied
thousand
bellairs
preserved
his
composure
fifty
said
he
but
there
was
a
stir
among
the
onlookers
and
what
was
of
more
importance
captain
trent
had
turned
pale
and
visibly
gulped
it
in
again
jim
said
i
is
thousand
said
jim
fifty
said
bellairs
and
then
the
bidding
returned
to
its
original
movement
by
hundreds
and
fifties
but
i
had
been
able
in
the
meanwhile
to
draw
two
conclusions
in
the
first
place
bellairs
had
made
his
last
advance
with
a
smile
of
gratified
vanity
and
i
could
see
the
creature
was
glorying
in
the
kudos
of
an
unusual
position
and
secure
of
ultimate
success
in
the
second
trent
had
once
more
changed
colour
at
the
thousand
leap
and
his
relief
when
he
heard
the
answering
fifty
was
manifest
and
unaffected
here
then
was
a
problem
both
were
presumably
in
the
same
interest
yet
the
one
was
not
in
the
confidence
of
the
other
nor
was
this
all
a
few
bids
later
it
chanced
that
my
eye
encountered
that
of
captain
trent
and
his
which
glittered
with
excitement
was
instantly
and
i
thought
guiltily
withdrawn
he
wished
then
to
conceal
his
interest
as
jim
had
said
there
was
some
blamed
thing
going
on
and
for
certain
here
were
these
two
men
so
strangely
united
so
strangely
divided
both
to
keep
the
wreck
from
us
and
that
at
an
exorbitant
figure
was
the
wreck
worth
more
than
we
supposed
a
sudden
heat
was
kindled
in
my
brain
the
bids
were
nearing
longhurst
limit
of
five
thousand
another
minute
and
all
would
be
too
late
tearing
a
leaf
from
my
and
inspired
i
suppose
by
vanity
in
my
own
powers
of
inference
and
observation
i
took
the
one
mad
decision
of
my
life
you
care
to
go
ahead
i
wrote
in
for
all
i
jim
read
and
looked
round
at
me
like
one
bewildered
then
his
eyes
lightened
and
turning
again
to
the
auctioneer
he
bid
thousand
one
hundred
fifty
said
monotonous
bellairs
presently
pinkerton
scribbled
can
it
be
and
i
answered
still
on
paper
ca
imagine
but
there
something
watch
bellairs
go
up
to
the
ten
thousand
see
if
he
and
he
did
and
we
followed
long
before
this
word
had
gone
abroad
that
there
was
battle
royal
we
were
surrounded
by
a
crowd
that
looked
on
wondering
and
when
pinkerton
had
offered
ten
thousand
dollars
the
outside
value
of
the
cargo
even
were
it
safe
in
san
francisco
bay
and
bellairs
smirking
from
ear
to
ear
to
be
the
centre
of
so
much
attention
had
jerked
out
his
answering
fifty
wonder
deepened
to
excitement
thousand
one
hundred
said
jim
and
even
as
he
spoke
he
made
a
sudden
gesture
with
his
hand
his
face
changed
and
i
could
see
that
he
had
guessed
or
thought
that
he
had
guessed
the
mystery
as
he
scrawled
another
memorandum
in
his
his
hand
shook
like
a
ship
ran
the
legend
and
then
in
big
tremulous
and
with
a
flourish
that
overran
the
margin
to
be
sure
thought
i
this
must
be
the
secret
i
knew
that
scarce
a
ship
came
in
from
any
chinese
port
but
she
carried
somewhere
behind
a
bulkhead
or
in
some
cunning
hollow
of
the
beams
a
nest
of
the
valuable
poison
doubtless
there
was
some
such
treasure
on
the
flying
scud
how
much
was
it
worth
we
knew
not
we
were
gambling
in
the
dark
but
trent
knew
and
bellairs
and
we
could
only
watch
and
judge
by
this
time
neither
pinkerton
nor
i
were
of
sound
mind
pinkerton
was
beside
himself
his
eyes
like
lamps
i
shook
in
every
member
to
any
stranger
entering
say
in
the
course
of
the
fifteenth
thousand
we
should
probably
have
cut
a
poorer
figure
than
bellairs
himself
but
we
did
not
pause
and
the
crowd
watched
us
now
in
silence
now
with
a
buzz
of
whispers
seventeen
thousand
had
been
reached
when
douglas
longhurst
forcing
his
way
into
the
opposite
row
of
faces
conspicuously
and
repeatedly
shook
his
head
at
jim
jim
answer
was
a
note
of
two
words
racket
which
when
the
great
man
had
perused
he
shook
his
finger
warningly
and
departed
i
thought
with
a
sorrowful
countenance
although
longhurst
knew
nothing
of
bellairs
the
shady
lawyer
knew
all
about
the
wrecker
boss
he
had
seen
him
enter
the
ring
with
manifest
expectation
he
saw
him
depart
and
the
bids
continue
with
manifest
surprise
and
disappointment
he
plainly
thought
is
not
the
ring
i
fighting
then
and
he
determined
to
put
on
a
spurt
thousand
said
he
fifty
said
jim
taking
a
leaf
out
of
his
adversary
book
thousand
from
bellairs
fifty
from
jim
with
a
little
nervous
titter
and
with
one
consent
they
returned
to
the
old
pace
only
now
it
was
bellairs
who
took
the
hundreds
and
jim
who
did
the
fifty
business
but
by
this
time
our
idea
had
gone
abroad
i
could
hear
the
word
pass
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
by
the
looks
directed
at
us
i
could
see
we
were
supposed
to
have
some
private
information
and
here
an
incident
occurred
highly
typical
of
san
francisco
close
at
my
back
there
had
stood
for
some
time
a
stout
gentleman
with
pleasant
eyes
hair
pleasantly
grizzled
and
a
ruddy
pleasing
face
all
of
a
sudden
he
appeared
as
a
third
competitor
skied
the
flying
scud
with
four
fat
bids
of
a
thousand
dollars
each
and
then
as
suddenly
fled
the
field
remaining
thenceforth
as
before
a
silent
interested
spectator
ever
since
longhurst
useless
intervention
bellairs
had
seemed
uneasy
and
at
this
new
attack
he
began
in
his
turn
to
scribble
a
note
between
the
bids
i
imagined
naturally
enough
that
it
would
go
to
captain
trent
but
when
it
was
done
and
the
writer
turned
and
looked
behind
him
in
the
crowd
to
my
unspeakable
amazement
he
did
not
seem
to
remark
the
captain
presence
boy
messenger
boy
i
heard
him
say
call
me
a
messenger
at
last
somebody
did
but
it
was
not
the
captain
sending
for
instructions
i
wrote
to
pinkerton
money
he
wrote
back
i
strike
out
i
think
this
is
the
i
nodded
thousand
said
pinkerton
making
a
leap
of
close
upon
three
thousand
dollars
i
could
see
doubt
in
bellairs
eye
then
sudden
resolution
thousand
said
he
thousand
said
pinkerton
there
was
a
long
pause
during
which
bellairs
countenance
was
as
a
book
and
then
not
much
too
soon
for
the
impending
hammer
thousand
and
five
dollars
said
he
pinkerton
and
i
exchanged
eloquent
glances
we
were
of
one
mind
bellairs
had
tried
a
bluff
now
he
perceived
his
mistake
and
was
bidding
against
time
he
was
trying
to
spin
out
the
sale
until
the
messenger
boy
returned
thousand
dollars
said
pinkerton
his
voice
was
like
a
ghost
and
tottered
with
emotion
thousand
and
five
dollars
said
bellairs
thousand
said
pinkerton
beg
your
pardon
pinkerton
did
i
hear
you
make
an
advance
sir
asked
the
auctioneer
i
have
a
difficulty
in
speaking
gasped
jim
fifty
thousand
bellairs
was
on
his
feet
in
a
moment
he
said
have
to
beg
the
favour
of
three
moments
at
the
telephone
in
this
matter
i
am
acting
on
behalf
of
a
certain
party
to
whom
i
have
just
written
have
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
this
said
the
auctioneer
brutally
am
here
to
sell
this
wreck
do
you
make
any
advance
on
fifty
thousand
have
the
honour
to
explain
to
you
sir
returned
bellairs
with
a
miserable
assumption
of
dignity
thousand
was
the
figure
named
by
my
principal
but
if
you
will
give
me
the
small
favour
of
two
moments
at
the
telephone
nonsense
said
the
auctioneer
you
make
no
advance
i
knock
it
down
to
warn
you
cried
the
attorney
with
sudden
shrillness
a
care
what
you
about
you
are
here
to
sell
for
the
underwriters
let
me
tell
you
not
to
act
for
douglas
longhurst
this
sale
has
been
already
disgracefully
interrupted
to
allow
that
person
to
hold
a
consultation
with
his
minions
it
has
been
much
commented
was
no
complaint
at
the
time
said
the
auctioneer
manifestly
discountenanced
should
have
complained
at
the
am
not
here
to
conduct
this
sale
replied
bellairs
am
not
paid
for
i
am
you
see
retorted
the
auctioneer
his
impudence
quite
restored
and
he
resumed
his
advance
on
fifty
thousand
dollars
no
advance
on
fifty
thousand
no
advance
gentlemen
going
at
fifty

the

of
the

going
going
gone
god
jim
can
we
pay
the
money
i
cried
as
the
stroke
of
the
hammer
seemed
to
recall
me
from
a
dream
got
to
be
raised
said
he
white
as
a
sheet
be
a
hell
of
a
strain
loudon
the
credit
good
for
it
i
think
but
i
shall
have
to
get
around
write
me
a
cheque
for
your
stuff
meet
me
at
the
occidental
in
an
i
wrote
my
cheque
at
a
desk
and
i
declare
i
could
never
have
recognised
my
signature
jim
was
gone
in
a
moment
trent
had
vanished
even
earlier
only
bellairs
remained
exchanging
insults
with
the
auctioneer
and
behold
as
i
pushed
my
way
out
of
the
exchange
who
should
run
full
tilt
into
my
arms
but
the
messenger
boy
it
was
by
so
near
a
margin
that
we
became
the
owners
of
the
flying
scud
chapter
x
in
which
the
crew
vanish
at
the
door
of
the
exchange
i
found
myself
of
the
short
gentleman
who
had
made
an
appearance
so
vigorous
and
so
brief
in
the
great
battle
you
dodd
he
said
and
your
friend
stuck
to
your
guns
thanks
to
you
sir
i
replied
us
up
a
thousand
at
a
time
and
tempting
all
the
speculators
in
san
francisco
to
come
and
have
a
that
was
temporary
insanity
said
he
i
thank
the
higher
powers
i
am
still
a
free
man
walking
this
way
dodd
i
walk
along
with
you
it
pleasant
for
an
old
fogy
like
myself
to
see
the
young
bloods
in
the
ring
i
done
some
pretty
wild
gambles
in
my
time
in
this
very
city
when
it
was
a
smaller
place
and
i
was
a
younger
man
yes
i
know
you
dodd
by
sight
i
may
say
i
know
you
extremely
well
you
and
your
followers
the
fellows
in
the
kilts
eh
pardon
me
but
i
have
the
misfortune
to
own
a
little
box
on
the
saucelito
shore
i
be
glad
to
see
you
there
any
sunday
without
the
fellows
in
kilts
you
know
and
i
can
give
you
a
bottle
of
wine
and
show
you
the
best
collection
of
arctic
voyages
in
the
states
morgan
is
my
name
judge
morgan
a
welshman
and
a
if
you
a
pioneer
cried
i
to
me
and
i
provide
you
with
an
want
your
axes
for
yourself
i
fancy
he
returned
with
one
of
his
quick
looks
you
have
private
knowledge
there
will
be
a
good
deal
of
rather
violent
wrecking
to
do
before
you
find
that
opium
do
you
call
it
it
either
opium
or
we
are
stark
staring
mad
i
replied
i
assure
you
we
have
no
private
information
we
went
in
as
i
suppose
you
did
yourself
on
observer
sir
inquired
the
judge
may
say
it
is
my
trade
or
rather
was
said
i
now
and
what
did
you
think
of
bellairs
he
asked
little
indeed
said
i
may
tell
you
continued
the
judge
to
me
the
employment
of
a
fellow
like
that
appears
inexplicable
i
knew
him
he
knows
me
too
he
has
often
heard
from
me
in
court
and
i
assure
you
the
man
is
utterly
blown
upon
it
is
not
safe
to
trust
him
with
a
dollar
and
here
we
find
him
dealing
up
to
fifty
thousand
i
ca
think
who
can
have
so
trusted
him
but
i
am
very
sure
it
was
a
stranger
in
san
one
for
the
owners
i
suppose
said
i
not
exclaimed
the
judge
in
london
can
have
nothing
to
say
to
opium
smuggled
between
hong
kong
and
san
francisco
i
should
rather
fancy
they
would
be
the
last
to
hear
of
it
until
the
ship
was
seized
no
i
was
thinking
of
the
captain
but
where
would
he
get
the
money
above
all
after
having
laid
out
so
much
to
buy
the
stuff
in
china
unless
indeed
he
were
acting
for
some
one
in
and
in
that
case
here
we
go
round
again
in
the
vicious
circle
bellairs
would
not
have
been
think
i
can
assure
you
it
was
not
the
captain
said
i
he
and
bellairs
are
not
that
the
captain
with
the
red
face
and
coloured
handkerchief
he
seemed
to
me
to
follow
bellairs
game
with
the
most
thrilling
interest
objected
morgan
true
said
i
is
deeply
interested
he
very
likely
knew
bellairs
and
he
certainly
knew
what
he
was
there
for
but
i
can
put
my
hand
in
the
fire
that
bellairs
did
know
singularity
observed
the
judge
we
have
had
a
capital
forenoon
but
you
take
an
old
lawyer
advice
and
get
to
midway
island
as
fast
as
you
can
there
a
pot
of
money
on
the
table
and
bellairs
and
are
not
the
men
to
stick
at
with
this
parting
counsel
judge
morgan
shook
hands
and
made
off
along
montgomery
street
while
i
entered
the
occidental
hotel
on
the
steps
of
which
we
had
finished
our
conversation
i
was
well
known
to
the
clerks
and
as
soon
as
it
was
understood
that
i
was
there
to
wait
for
pinkerton
and
lunch
i
was
invited
to
a
seat
inside
the
counter
here
then
in
a
retired
corner
i
was
beginning
to
come
a
little
to
myself
after
these
so
violent
experiences
when
who
should
come
hurrying
in
and
after
a
moment
with
a
clerk
fly
to
one
of
the
telephone
boxes
but
henry
bellairs
in
person
call
it
what
you
will
but
the
impulse
was
irresistible
and
i
rose
and
took
a
place
immediately
at
the
man
back
it
may
be
some
excuse
that
i
had
often
practised
this
very
innocent
form
of
eavesdropping
upon
strangers
and
for
fun
indeed
i
scarce
know
anything
that
gives
a
lower
view
of
man
intelligence
than
to
overhear
as
you
thus
do
one
side
of
a
communication
said
the
attorney
and
or
some
such
numbers
that
all
right
bellairs
occidental
the
wires
are
fouled
in
the
other
place
yes
about
three
minutes
yes
yes
your
figure
i
am
sorry
to
say
no
i
had
no
authority
neither
more
nor
less
i
have
every
reason
to
suppose
so
o
pinkerton
montana
block
yes
yes
very
good
sir
as
you
will
sir
disconnect
bellairs
turned
to
leave
at
sight
of
me
behind
him
up
flew
his
hands
and
he
winced
and
cringed
as
though
in
fear
of
bodily
attack
you
he
cried
and
then
somewhat
recovered
pinkerton
partner
i
believe
i
am
pleased
to
see
you
sir
to
congratulate
you
on
your
late
and
with
that
he
was
gone
obsequiously
bowing
as
he
passed
and
now
a
madcap
humour
came
upon
me
it
was
plain
bellairs
had
been
communicating
with
his
principal
i
knew
the
number
if
not
the
name
should
i
ring
up
at
once
it
was
more
than
likely
he
would
return
in
person
to
the
telephone
why
should
not
i
dash
vocally
into
the
presence
of
this
mysterious
person
and
have
some
fun
for
my
money
i
pressed
the
bell
said
i
again
and
a
phantom
central
repeated
the
numbers
there
was
a
pause
and
then
two
four
one
came
in
a
tiny
voice
into
my
ear
a
voice
with
the
english
the
voice
plainly
of
a
gentleman
that
you
again
bellairs
it
trilled
tell
you
it
no
use
is
that
you
bellairs
who
is
that
only
want
to
put
a
single
question
said
i
civilly
do
you
want
to
buy
the
flying
scud
no
answer
came
the
telephone
vibrated
and
hummed
in
miniature
with
all
the
numerous
talk
of
a
great
city
but
the
voice
of
was
silent
once
and
twice
i
put
my
question
but
the
tiny
english
voice
i
heard
no
more
the
man
then
had
fled
fled
from
an
impertinent
question
it
scarce
seemed
natural
to
me
unless
on
the
principle
that
the
wicked
fleeth
when
no
man
pursueth
i
took
the
telephone
list
and
turned
the
number
up
keane
res
mission
and
that
short
of
driving
to
the
house
and
renewing
my
impertinence
in
person
was
all
that
i
could
do
yet
as
i
resumed
my
seat
in
the
corner
of
the
office
i
was
conscious
of
a
new
element
of
the
uncertain
the
underhand
perhaps
even
the
dangerous
in
our
adventure
and
there
was
now
a
new
picture
in
my
mental
gallery
to
hang
beside
that
of
the
wreck
under
its
canopy
of
and
of
captain
trent
mopping
his
red
brow
the
picture
of
a
man
with
a
telephone
to
his
ear
and
at
the
small
voice
of
a
single
question
struck
suddenly
as
white
as
ashes
from
these
considerations
i
was
awakened
by
the
striking
of
the
clock
an
hour
and
nearly
twenty
minutes
had
elapsed
since
pinkerton
departed
for
the
money
he
was
twenty
minutes
behind
time
and
to
me
who
knew
so
well
his
gluttonous
despatch
of
business
and
had
so
frequently
admired
his
iron
punctuality
the
fact
spoke
volumes
the
twenty
minutes
slowly
stretched
into
an
hour
the
hour
had
nearly
extended
to
a
second
and
i
still
sat
in
my
corner
of
the
office
or
paced
the
marble
pavement
of
the
hall
a
prey
to
the
most
wretched
anxiety
and
penitence
the
hour
for
lunch
was
nearly
over
before
i
remembered
that
i
had
not
eaten
heaven
knows
i
had
no
appetite
but
there
might
still
be
much
to
do
it
was
needful
i
should
keep
myself
in
proper
trim
if
it
were
only
to
digest
the
now
too
probable
bad
news
and
leaving
word
at
the
office
for
pinkerton
i
sat
down
to
table
and
called
for
soup
oysters
and
a
pint
of
champagne
i
was
not
long
set
before
my
friend
returned
he
looked
pale
and
rather
old
refused
to
hear
of
food
and
called
for
tea
suppose
all
up
said
i
with
an
incredible
sinking
he
replied
pulled
it
through
loudon
just
pulled
it
through
i
could
have
raised
another
cent
in
all
people
do
like
it
longhurst
even
went
back
on
me
said
he
was
a
what
the
odds
said
i
all
we
wanted
is
it
i
tell
you
i
had
to
pay
blood
for
that
money
cried
my
friend
with
almost
savage
energy
and
gloom
all
on
ninety
days
too
i
could
get
another
day
not
another
day
if
we
go
ahead
with
this
affair
loudon
you
have
to
go
yourself
and
make
the
fur
fly
i
stay
of
course
i
got
to
stay
and
face
the
trouble
in
this
city
though
i
tell
you
i
just
long
to
go
i
would
show
these
fat
brutes
of
sailors
what
work
was
i
would
be
all
through
that
wreck
and
out
at
the
other
end
before
they
had
boosted
themselves
upon
the
deck
but
do
your
level
best
loudon
i
depend
on
you
for
that
you
must
be
all
fire
and
grit
and
dash
from
the
word
that
schooner
and
the
boodle
on
board
of
her
are
bound
to
be
here
before
three
months
or
it
swear
i
do
my
best
jim
i
work
double
tides
said
i
is
my
fault
that
you
are
in
this
thing
and
i
get
you
out
again
or
kill
myself
but
what
is
that
you
say
we
go
ahead
have
we
any
choice
then
coming
to
that
said
jim
is
that
i
doubt
the
investment
do
blame
yourself
for
that
you
showed
a
fine
sound
business
instinct
i
always
knew
it
was
in
you
but
then
it
ripped
right
out
i
guess
that
little
beast
of
an
attorney
knew
what
he
was
doing
and
he
wanted
nothing
better
than
to
go
beyond
no
there
profit
in
the
deal
it
not
that
it
these
bills
and
the
strain
i
given
the
credit
for
i
been
up
and
down
borrowing
and
begging
and
bribing
to
borrow
i
do
believe
there
another
man
but
me
in
he
cried
with
a
sudden
fervor
of
self
admiration
could
have
raised
that
last
ten
thousand
then
there
another
thing
i
had
hoped
you
might
have
peddled
that
opium
through
the
islands
which
is
safer
and
more
profitable
but
with
this
limit
you
must
make
tracks
for
honolulu
straight
and
communicate
by
steamer
try
to
put
up
something
for
you
there
i
have
a
man
spoken
to
posted
on
that
line
of
biz
keep
a
bright
lookout
for
him
as
soon
you
make
the
islands
for
it
on
the
cards
he
might
pick
you
up
at
sea
in
a
whaleboat
or
a
and
bring
the
dollars
right
on
it
shows
how
much
i
had
suffered
morally
during
my
sojourn
in
san
francisco
that
even
now
when
our
fortunes
trembled
in
the
balance
i
should
have
consented
to
become
a
smuggler
and
of
all
things
a
smuggler
of
opium
yet
i
did
and
that
in
silence
without
a
protest
not
without
a
twinge
suppose
said
i
the
opium
is
so
securely
hidden
that
i
ca
get
hands
on
it
you
will
stay
there
till
that
brig
is
and
stay
and
split
that
with
your
penknife
cried
pinkerton
stuff
is
there
we
know
that
and
it
must
be
found
but
all
this
is
only
the
one
string
to
our
bow
though
i
tell
you
i
gone
into
it
as
if
it
was
our
bottom
dollar
why
the
first
thing
i
did
before
i
raised
a
cent
and
with
this
other
notion
in
my
head
already
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
secure
the
schooner
the
nora
creina
she
is
tons
quite
big
enough
for
our
purpose
since
the
rice
is
spoiled
and
the
fastest
thing
of
her
tonnage
out
of
san
francisco
for
a
bonus
of
two
hundred
and
a
monthly
charter
of
three
i
have
her
for
my
own
time
wages
and
provisions
say
four
hundred
more
a
drop
in
the
bucket
they
began
firing
the
cargo
out
of
her
she
was
part
loaded
near
two
hours
ago
and
about
the
same
time
john
smith
got
the
order
for
the
stores
that
what
i
call
doubt
of
that
said
i
the
other
notion
here
it
is
said
jim
agree
with
me
that
bellairs
was
ready
to
go
higher
i
saw
where
he
was
coming
and
why
should
he
said
i
that
the
line
the
line
loudon
dodd
assented
jim
bellairs
and
his
principal
have
any
desire
to
go
me
better
i
their
a
sudden
thought
a
sudden
fear
shot
into
my
mind
what
if
i
had
been
right
what
if
my
childish
pleasantry
had
frightened
the
principal
away
and
thus
destroyed
our
chance
shame
closed
my
mouth
i
began
instinctively
a
long
course
of
reticence
and
it
was
without
a
word
of
my
meeting
with
bellairs
or
my
discovery
of
the
address
in
mission
street
that
i
continued
the
discussion
fifty
thousand
was
originally
mentioned
as
a
round
sum
said
i
at
least
so
bellairs
supposed
but
at
the
same
time
it
may
be
an
outside
sum
and
to
cover
the
expenses
we
have
already
incurred
for
the
money
and
the
schooner
i
am
far
from
blaming
you
i
see
how
needful
it
was
to
be
ready
for
either
event
but
to
cover
them
we
shall
want
a
rather
large
will
go
to
sixty
thousand
it
my
belief
if
he
were
properly
handled
he
would
take
the
hundred
replied
pinkerton
back
on
the
way
the
sale
ran
at
the
is
my
own
impression
as
regards
bellairs
i
admitted
point
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
bellairs
himself
may
be
mistaken
that
what
he
supposed
to
be
a
round
sum
was
really
an
outside
loudon
if
that
is
so
said
jim
with
extraordinary
gravity
of
face
and
voice
that
is
so
let
him
take
the
flying
scud
at
fifty
thousand
and
joy
go
with
her
i
prefer
the
that
so
jim
are
we
dipped
as
bad
as
that
i
cried
put
our
hand
farther
out
than
we
can
pull
it
in
again
loudon
he
replied
man
that
fifty
thousand
dollars
before
we
get
clear
again
will
cost
us
nearer
seventy
yes
it
figures
up
overhead
to
more
than
ten
per
cent
a
month
and
i
could
do
no
better
and
there
the
man
breathing
could
have
done
as
well
it
was
a
miracle
loudon
i
could
but
admire
myself
o
if
we
had
just
the
four
months
and
you
know
loudon
it
may
still
be
done
with
your
energy
and
charm
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
you
can
run
that
schooner
as
you
ran
one
of
your
picnics
and
we
may
have
luck
and
o
man
if
we
do
pull
it
through
what
a
dashing
operation
it
will
be
what
an
advertisement
what
a
thing
to
talk
of
and
remember
all
our
lives
however
he
broke
off
suddenly
must
try
the
safe
thing
first
here
for
the
shyster
there
was
another
struggle
in
my
mind
whether
i
should
even
now
admit
my
knowledge
of
the
mission
street
address
but
i
had
let
the
favourable
moment
slip
i
had
now
which
made
it
the
more
awkward
not
merely
the
original
discovery
but
my
late
suppression
to
confess
i
could
not
help
reasoning
besides
that
the
more
natural
course
was
to
approach
the
principal
by
the
road
of
his
agent
office
and
there
weighed
upon
my
spirits
a
conviction
that
we
were
already
too
late
and
that
the
man
was
gone
two
hours
ago
once
more
then
i
held
my
peace
and
after
an
exchange
of
words
at
the
telephone
to
assure
ourselves
he
was
at
home
we
set
out
for
the
attorney
office
the
endless
streets
of
any
american
city
pass
from
one
end
to
another
through
strange
degrees
and
vicissitudes
of
splendour
and
distress
running
under
the
same
name
between
monumental
warehouses
the
dens
and
taverns
of
thieves
and
the
sward
and
shrubbery
of
villas
in
san
francisco
the
sharp
inequalities
of
the
ground
and
the
sea
bordering
on
so
many
sides
greatly
exaggerate
these
contrasts
the
street
for
which
we
were
now
bound
took
its
rise
among
blowing
sands
somewhere
in
view
of
the
lone
mountain
cemetery
ran
for
a
term
across
that
rather
windy
olympus
of
nob
hill
or
perhaps
just
skirted
its
frontier
passed
almost
immediately
after
through
a
stage
of
little
houses
rather
impudently
painted
and
offering
to
the
eye
of
the
observer
this
diagnostic
peculiarity
that
the
huge
brass
plates
upon
the
small
and
highly
coloured
doors
bore
only
the
first
names
of
ladies
norah
or
lily
or
florence
traversed
china
town
where
it
was
doubtless
undermined
with
opium
cellars
and
its
blocks
pierced
after
the
similitude
of
with
a
hundred
doors
and
passages
and
galleries
enjoyed
a
glimpse
of
high
publicity
at
the
corner
of
kearney
and
proceeded
among
dives
and
warehouses
towards
the
city
front
and
the
region
of
the
in
this
last
stage
of
its
career
where
it
was
both
grimy
and
solitary
and
alternately
quiet
and
roaring
to
the
wheels
of
drays
we
found
a
certain
house
of
some
pretension
to
neatness
and
furnished
with
a
rustic
outside
stair
on
the
pillar
of
the
stair
a
black
plate
bore
in
gilded
lettering
this
device
bellairs
consultations
to
on
ascending
the
stairs
a
door
was
found
to
stand
open
on
the
balcony
with
this
further
inscription
bellairs
wonder
what
we
do
next
said
i
we
sail
right
in
returned
jim
and
suited
the
action
to
the
word
the
room
in
which
we
found
ourselves
was
clean
but
extremely
bare
a
rather
secretaire
stood
by
the
wall
with
a
chair
drawn
to
the
desk
in
one
corner
was
a
shelf
with
law
books
and
i
can
remember
literally
not
another
stick
of
furniture
one
inference
imposed
itself
bellairs
was
in
the
habit
of
sitting
down
himself
and
suffering
his
clients
to
stand
at
the
far
end
and
veiled
by
a
curtain
of
red
baize
a
second
door
communicated
with
the
interior
of
the
house
hence
after
some
coughing
and
stamping
we
elicited
the
shyster
who
came
timorously
forth
for
all
the
world
like
a
man
in
fear
of
bodily
assault
and
then
recognising
his
guests
suffered
from
what
i
can
only
call
a
nervous
paroxysm
of
courtesy
pinkerton
and
partner
said
he
will
go
and
fetch
you
the
least
said
jim
time
much
rather
stand
this
is
business
bellairs
this
morning
as
you
know
i
bought
the
wreck
flying
the
lawyer
nodded
bought
her
pursued
my
friend
a
figure
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
cargo
and
the
circumstances
as
they
appeared
now
you
think
better
of
it
and
would
like
to
be
off
with
your
bargain
i
have
been
figuring
upon
this
returned
the
lawyer
client
i
will
not
hide
from
you
was
displeased
with
me
for
putting
her
so
high
i
think
we
were
both
too
heated
pinkerton
rivalry
the
spirit
of
competition
but
i
will
be
quite
frank
i
know
when
i
am
dealing
with
gentlemen
and
i
am
almost
certain
if
you
leave
the
matter
in
my
hands
my
client
would
relieve
you
of
the
bargain
so
as
you
would
he
consulted
our
faces
with
calculation
he
added
shrilly
and
here
pinkerton
amazed
me
a
little
too
thin
said
he
have
the
wreck
i
know
boodle
in
her
and
i
mean
to
keep
her
what
i
want
is
some
points
which
may
save
me
needless
expense
and
which
i
prepared
to
pay
for
money
down
the
thing
for
you
to
consider
is
just
this
am
i
to
deal
with
you
or
direct
with
your
principal
if
you
are
prepared
to
give
me
the
facts
right
off
why
name
your
figure
only
one
thing
added
jim
holding
a
finger
up
i
say
down
i
mean
bills
payable
when
the
ship
returns
and
if
the
information
proves
reliable
i
do
buy
pigs
in
i
had
seen
the
lawyer
face
light
up
for
a
moment
and
then
at
the
sound
of
jim
proviso
miserably
fade
guess
you
know
more
about
this
wreck
than
i
do
pinkerton
said
he
only
know
that
i
was
told
to
buy
the
thing
and
tried
and
i
like
about
you
bellairs
is
that
you
waste
no
time
said
jim
then
your
client
name
and
consideration
replied
the
lawyer
with
indescribable
furtivity
can
not
see
that
i
am
entitled
to
communicate
my
client
name
i
will
sound
him
for
you
with
pleasure
if
you
care
to
instruct
me
but
i
can
not
see
that
i
can
give
you
his
well
said
jim
and
put
his
hat
on
a
strong
step
it
between
every
sentence
was
a
clear
pause
think
better
of
it
well
come
call
it
a
dollar
pinkerton
sir
exclaimed
the
offended
attorney
and
indeed
i
myself
was
almost
afraid
that
jim
had
mistaken
his
man
and
gone
too
far
present
use
for
a
dollar
says
jim
look
here
bellairs
we
both
busy
men
and
i
go
to
my
outside
figure
with
you
right
away
this
pinkerton
i
broke
in
know
the
address
mission
i
do
not
know
whether
pinkerton
or
bellairs
was
the
more
taken
aback
in
snakes
did
you
say
so
loudon
cried
my
friend
did
ask
for
it
before
said
i
colouring
to
my
temples
under
his
troubled
eyes
it
was
bellairs
who
broke
silence
kindly
supplying
me
with
all
that
i
had
yet
to
learn
you
know
dickson
address
said
he
plainly
burning
to
be
rid
of
us
suppose
i
need
detain
you
no
i
do
not
know
how
pinkerton
felt
but
i
had
death
in
my
soul
as
we
came
down
the
outside
stair
from
the
den
of
this
blotched
spider
my
whole
being
was
strung
waiting
for
jim
first
question
and
prepared
to
blurt
out
i
believe
almost
with
tears
a
full
avowal
but
my
friend
asked
nothing
must
hack
it
said
he
tearing
off
in
the
direction
of
the
nearest
stand
time
to
be
lost
you
saw
how
i
changed
ground
no
use
in
paying
the
shyster
again
i
expected
a
reference
to
my
suppression
again
i
was
disappointed
it
was
plain
jim
feared
the
subject
and
i
felt
i
almost
hated
him
for
that
fear
at
last
when
we
were
already
in
the
hack
and
driving
towards
mission
street
i
could
bear
my
suspense
no
longer
do
not
ask
me
about
that
address
said
i
said
he
quickly
and
timidly
was
it
i
would
like
to
the
note
of
timidity
offended
me
like
a
buffet
my
temper
rose
as
hot
as
mustard
must
request
you
do
not
ask
me
said
i
is
a
matter
i
can
not
the
moment
the
foolish
words
were
said
that
moment
i
would
have
given
worlds
to
recall
them
how
much
more
when
pinkerton
patting
my
hand
replied
right
dear
boy
not
another
word
that
all
done
convinced
it
perfectly
to
return
upon
the
subject
was
beyond
my
courage
but
i
vowed
inwardly
that
i
should
do
my
utmost
in
the
future
for
this
mad
speculation
and
that
i
would
cut
myself
in
pieces
before
jim
should
lose
one
dollar
we
had
no
sooner
arrived
at
the
address
than
i
had
other
things
to
think
of
dickson
he
gone
said
the
landlady
where
had
he
gone
sure
i
ca
tell
you
she
answered
was
quite
a
stranger
to
he
express
his
baggage
asked
pinkerton
any
was
the
reply
came
last
night
and
left
again
with
a
did
he
leave
i
inquired
was
about
noon
replied
the
landlady
one
rang
up
the
telephone
and
asked
for
him
and
i
reckon
he
got
some
news
for
he
left
right
away
although
his
rooms
were
taken
by
the
week
he
seemed
considerable
put
out
i
reckon
it
was
a
my
heart
sank
perhaps
my
idiotic
jest
had
indeed
driven
him
away
and
again
i
asked
myself
why
and
whirled
for
a
moment
in
a
vortex
of
untenable
hypotheses
was
he
like
pinkerton
was
asking
when
i
returned
to
consciousness
of
my
surroundings
clean
shaved
man
said
the
woman
and
could
be
led
or
driven
into
no
more
significant
description
up
at
the
nearest
said
pinkerton
to
the
driver
and
when
there
the
telephone
was
put
in
operation
and
the
message
sped
to
the
pacific
mail
steamship
company
office
this
was
in
the
days
before
spreckels
had
arisen
does
the
next
china
steamer
touch
at
honolulu
city
of
pekin
she
cast
off
the
dock
at
one
came
the
reply
a
clear
case
of
bolt
said
jim
skipped
or
my
name
not
pinkerton
he
gone
to
head
us
off
at
midway
somehow
i
was
not
so
sure
there
were
elements
in
the
case
not
known
to
pinkerton
the
fears
of
the
captain
for
example
that
inclined
me
otherwise
and
the
idea
that
i
had
terrified
dickson
into
flight
though
resting
on
so
slender
a
foundation
clung
obstinately
in
my
mind
we
see
the
list
of
passengers
i
asked
is
such
a
blamed
common
name
returned
jim
then
as
like
as
not
he
would
change
at
this
i
had
another
intuition
a
negative
of
a
street
scene
taken
unconsciously
when
i
was
absorbed
in
other
thought
rose
in
my
memory
with
not
a
feature
blurred
a
view
from
bellairs
door
as
we
were
coming
down
of
muddy
roadway
passing
drays
matted
telegraph
wires
a
chinaboy
with
a
basket
on
his
head
and
almost
opposite
a
corner
grocery
with
the
name
of
dickson
in
great
gilt
letters
said
i
are
right
he
would
change
it
and
anyway
i
believe
it
was
his
name
at
all
i
believe
he
took
it
from
a
corner
grocery
beside
like
as
not
said
jim
still
standing
on
the
sidewalk
with
contracted
brows
what
shall
we
do
next
i
asked
natural
thing
would
be
to
rush
the
schooner
he
replied
i
do
know
i
telephoned
the
captain
to
go
at
it
head
down
and
heels
in
air
he
answered
like
a
little
man
and
i
guess
he
getting
around
i
believe
loudon
we
give
trent
a
chance
trent
was
in
it
he
was
in
it
up
to
the
neck
even
if
he
could
buy
he
could
give
us
the
straight
think
so
too
said
i
shall
we
find
him
consulate
of
course
said
jim
that
another
reason
for
taking
him
first
we
can
hustle
that
schooner
up
all
evening
but
when
the
consulate
shut
it
at
the
consulate
we
learned
that
captain
trent
had
alighted
such
is
i
believe
the
classic
phrase
at
the
what
cheer
house
to
that
large
and
unaristocratic
hostelry
we
drove
and
addressed
ourselves
to
a
large
clerk
who
was
chewing
a
toothpick
and
looking
straight
before
him
jacob
trent
said
the
clerk
has
he
gone
asked
pinkerton
say
said
the
clerk
did
he
go
i
asked
know
said
the
clerk
and
with
the
simplicity
of
a
monarch
offered
us
the
spectacle
of
his
broad
back
what
might
have
happened
next
i
dread
to
picture
for
excitement
had
been
growing
steadily
and
now
burned
dangerously
high
but
we
were
spared
extremities
by
the
intervention
of
a
second
clerk
dodd
he
exclaimed
running
forward
to
the
counter
to
see
you
sir
can
i
do
anything
in
your
way
how
virtuous
actions
blossom
here
was
a
young
man
to
whose
pleased
ears
i
had
rehearsed
before
the
battle
mother
at
some
weekly
picnic
and
now
in
that
tense
moment
of
my
life
he
came
from
the
machine
to
be
my
helper
trent
of
the
wreck
o
yes
dodd
he
left
about
twelve
he
and
another
of
the
men
the
kanaka
went
earlier
by
the
city
of
pekin
i
know
that
i
remember
expressing
his
chest
captain
trent
i
inquire
dodd
yes
they
were
all
here
here
are
the
names
on
the
register
perhaps
you
would
care
to
look
at
them
while
i
go
and
see
about
the
baggage
i
drew
the
book
toward
me
and
stood
looking
at
the
four
names
all
written
in
the
same
hand
rather
a
big
and
rather
a
bad
one
trent
brown
hardy
and
instead
of
ah
sing
jos
amalu
said
i
suddenly
you
that
in
your
pocket
left
me
said
pinkerton
producing
the
paper
i
turned
to
the
account
of
the
wreck
said
i
the
name
goddedaal
mate
why
do
we
never
come
across
elias
goddedaal
so
said
jim
he
with
the
rest
in
that
saloon
when
you
saw
them
do
believe
it
said
i
were
only
four
and
there
was
none
that
behaved
like
a
at
this
moment
the
clerk
returned
with
his
report
captain
it
appeared
with
some
kind
of
an
express
waggon
and
he
and
the
man
took
off
three
chests
and
a
big
satchel
our
porter
helped
to
put
them
on
but
they
drove
the
cart
themselves
the
porter
thinks
they
went
down
town
it
was
about
in
time
for
the
city
of
pekin
observed
jim
many
of
them
were
here
i
inquired
sir
and
the
kanaka
replied
the
clerk
ca
somehow
fin
out
about
the
third
but
he
gone
goddedaal
the
mate
was
here
then
i
asked
dodd
none
but
what
you
see
says
the
clerk
you
never
heard
where
he
was
any
particular
reason
for
finding
these
men
dodd
inquired
the
clerk
gentleman
and
i
have
bought
the
wreck
i
explained
wished
to
get
some
information
and
it
is
very
annoying
to
find
the
men
all
a
certain
group
had
gradually
formed
about
us
for
the
wreck
was
still
a
matter
of
interest
and
at
this
one
of
the
bystanders
a
rough
seafaring
man
spoke
suddenly
guess
the
mate
wo
be
gone
said
he
main
sick
never
left
the
aboard
the
tempest
so
they
tell
jim
took
me
by
the
sleeve
to
the
consulate
said
he
but
even
at
the
consulate
nothing
was
known
of
goddedaal
the
doctor
of
the
tempest
had
certified
him
very
sick
he
had
sent
his
papers
in
but
never
appeared
in
person
before
the
authorities
you
a
telephone
laid
on
to
the
tempest
asked
pinkerton
on
yesterday
said
the
clerk
you
mind
asking
or
letting
me
ask
we
are
very
anxious
to
get
hold
of
right
said
the
clerk
and
turned
to
the
telephone
sorry
he
said
presently
goddedaal
has
left
the
ship
and
no
one
knows
where
he
you
pay
the
men
passage
home
i
inquired
a
sudden
thought
striking
me
they
want
it
said
the
clerk
they
do
but
we
paid
the
kanaka
passage
to
honolulu
this
morning
and
by
what
captain
trent
was
saying
i
understand
the
rest
are
going
home
you
have
paid
them
said
i
yet
said
the
clerk
you
would
be
a
good
deal
surprised
if
i
were
to
tell
you
they
were
gone
already
i
asked
i
should
think
you
were
mistaken
said
he
is
the
fact
however
said
i
am
sure
you
must
be
mistaken
he
repeated
i
use
your
telephone
one
moment
asked
pinkerton
and
as
soon
as
permission
had
been
granted
i
heard
him
ring
up
the
where
our
advertisements
were
usually
handled
more
i
did
not
hear
for
suddenly
recalling
the
big
bad
hand
in
the
register
of
the
what
cheer
house
i
asked
the
consulate
clerk
if
he
had
a
specimen
of
captain
trent
writing
whereupon
i
learned
that
the
captain
could
not
write
having
cut
his
hand
open
a
little
before
the
loss
of
the
brig
that
the
latter
part
of
the
log
even
had
been
written
up
by
goddedaal
and
that
trent
had
always
signed
with
his
left
hand
by
the
time
i
had
gleaned
this
information
pinkerton
was
ready
all
that
we
can
do
now
for
the
schooner
said
he
by
evening
i
lay
hands
on
goddedaal
or
my
name
not
have
you
managed
i
inquired
see
before
you
get
to
bed
said
pinkerton
now
after
all
this
backwarding
and
forwarding
and
that
hotel
clerk
and
that
bug
bellairs
it
be
a
change
and
a
kind
of
consolation
to
see
the
schooner
i
guess
things
are
humming
but
on
the
wharf
when
we
reached
it
there
was
no
sign
of
bustle
and
but
for
the
galley
smoke
no
mark
of
life
on
the
norah
creina
pinkerton
face
grew
pale
and
his
mouth
straightened
as
he
leaped
on
board
the
captain
of
this
and
he
left
the
phrase
unfinished
finding
no
epithet
sufficiently
energetic
for
his
thoughts
it
did
not
appear
whom
or
what
he
was
addressing
but
a
head
presumably
the
cook
appeared
in
answer
at
the
galley
door
the
cabin
at
dinner
said
the
cook
deliberately
chewing
as
he
spoke
that
cargo
out
of
it
there
some
of
it
out
we
get
at
the
rest
of
it
livelier
i
guess
there
be
something
broken
first
said
pinkerton
and
strode
to
the
cabin
here
we
found
a
man
fat
dark
and
quiet
seated
gravely
at
what
seemed
a
liberal
meal
he
looked
up
upon
our
entrance
and
seeing
pinkerton
continue
to
stand
facing
him
in
silence
hat
on
head
arms
folded
and
lips
compressed
an
expression
of
mingled
wonder
and
annoyance
began
to
dawn
upon
his
placid
face
said
jim
so
this
is
what
you
call
rushing
around
are
you
cries
the
captain
i
pinkerton
retorted
jim
as
though
the
name
had
been
a
talisman
not
very
civil
whoever
you
are
was
the
reply
but
still
a
certain
effect
had
been
produced
for
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
added
hastily
man
must
have
a
bit
of
dinner
you
know
your
mate
snapped
jim
up
town
returned
the
other
town
sneered
pinkerton
i
tell
you
what
you
are
you
a
fraud
and
if
i
was
afraid
of
dirtying
my
boot
i
would
kick
you
and
your
dinner
into
that
tell
you
something
too
retorted
the
captain
duskily
flushing
would
sail
this
ship
for
the
man
you
are
if
you
went
upon
your
knees
i
dealt
with
gentlemen
up
to
can
tell
you
the
names
of
a
number
of
gentlemen
you
never
deal
with
any
more
and
that
the
whole
of
longhurst
gang
said
jim
put
your
pipe
out
in
that
quarter
my
friend
here
rout
out
your
traps
as
quick
as
look
at
it
and
take
your
vermin
along
with
you
have
a
captain
in
this
very
night
that
a
sailor
and
some
sailors
to
work
for
go
when
i
please
and
that
morning
cried
the
captain
after
us
as
we
departed
for
the
shore
something
gone
wrong
with
the
world
it
must
have
come
bottom
up
wailed
pinkerton
and
then
the
hotel
clerk
and
now
this
fraud
and
what
am
i
to
do
for
a
captain
loudon
with
longhurst
gone
home
an
hour
ago
and
the
boys
all
scattered
know
said
i
in
and
then
to
the
driver
you
know
black
tom
thither
then
we
rattled
passed
through
the
bar
and
found
as
i
had
hoped
johnson
in
the
enjoyment
of
club
life
the
table
had
been
thrust
upon
one
side
a
south
sea
merchant
was
discoursing
music
from
a
in
one
corner
and
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
johnson
and
a
their
arms
clasped
about
each
other
bodies
somewhat
heavily
danced
the
room
was
both
cold
and
close
a
jet
of
gas
which
continually
menaced
the
heads
of
the
performers
shed
a
coarse
illumination
the
sounded
shrill
and
dismal
and
the
faces
of
all
concerned
were
in
their
gravity
it
were
of
course
indelicate
to
interrupt
these
solemn
frolics
so
we
edged
ourselves
to
chairs
for
all
the
world
like
belated
comers
in
a
and
patiently
waited
for
the
end
at
length
the
organist
having
exhausted
his
supply
of
breath
ceased
abruptly
in
the
middle
of
a
bar
with
the
cessation
of
the
strain
the
dancers
likewise
came
to
a
full
stop
swayed
a
moment
still
embracing
and
then
separated
and
looked
about
the
circle
for
applause
well
danced
said
one
but
it
appears
the
compliment
was
not
strong
enough
for
the
performers
who
forgetful
of
the
proverb
took
up
the
tale
in
person
said
johnson
may
be
no
sailor
but
i
can
dance
and
his
late
partner
with
an
almost
pathetic
conviction
added
foot
is
as
light
as
a
seeing
how
the
wind
set
you
may
be
sure
i
added
a
few
words
of
praise
before
i
carried
johnson
alone
into
the
passage
to
whom
thus
mollified
i
told
so
much
as
i
judged
needful
of
our
situation
and
begged
him
if
he
would
not
take
the
job
himself
to
find
me
a
smart
man
he
cried
could
no
more
do
it
than
i
could
try
to
go
to
hell
thought
you
were
a
mate
said
i
i
am
a
mate
giggled
johnson
you
do
catch
me
shipping
noways
else
but
i
tell
you
what
i
believe
i
can
get
you
arty
nares
you
seen
arty
navigator
and
a
son
of
a
gun
for
and
he
proceeded
to
explain
to
me
that
nares
who
had
the
promise
of
a
fine
barque
in
six
months
after
things
had
quieted
down
was
in
the
meantime
living
very
private
and
would
be
pleased
to
have
a
change
of
air
i
called
out
pinkerton
and
told
him
he
cried
as
soon
as
i
had
come
to
the
name
would
jump
at
the
chance
of
a
man
that
had
had
nares
trousers
on
why
loudon
he
the
smartest
mate
out
of
san
francisco
and
draws
his
dividends
regular
in
service
and
this
hearty
indorsation
clinched
the
proposal
johnson
agreed
to
produce
nares
before
six
the
following
morning
and
black
tom
being
called
into
the
consultation
promised
us
four
smart
hands
for
the
same
hour
and
even
what
appeared
to
all
of
us
excessive
promised
them
sober
the
streets
were
fully
lighted
when
we
left
black
tom
street
after
street
sparkling
with
gas
or
electricity
line
after
line
of
distant
luminaries
climbing
the
steep
sides
of
hills
towards
the
overvaulting
darkness
and
on
the
other
hand
where
the
waters
of
the
bay
invisibly
trembled
a
hundred
riding
lanterns
marked
the
position
of
a
hundred
ships
the
flew
high
in
heaven
and
at
the
level
of
man
life
and
business
it
was
clear
and
chill
by
silent
consent
we
paid
the
hack
off
and
proceeded
arm
in
arm
towards
the
poodle
dog
for
dinner
at
one
of
the
first
hoardings
i
was
aware
of
a
at
work
it
was
a
late
hour
for
this
employment
and
i
checked
pinkerton
until
the
sheet
should
be
unfolded
this
is
what
i
read
two
hundred
dollars
reward
officers
and
men
of
the
wrecked
brig
flying
scud
applying
personally
or
by
letter
at
the
office
of
james
pinkerton
montana
block
before
noon
tuesday
will
receive
two
hundred
dollars
reward
is
your
idea
pinkerton
i
cried
they
lost
no
time
i
say
that
for
them
not
like
the
fraud
said
he
mind
you
loudon
that
not
half
of
it
the
cream
of
the
idea
here
we
know
our
man
sick
well
a
copy
of
that
has
been
mailed
to
every
hospital
every
doctor
and
every
in
san
of
course
from
the
nature
of
our
business
pinkerton
could
do
a
thing
of
the
kind
at
a
figure
extremely
reduced
for
all
that
i
was
appalled
at
the
extravagance
and
said
so
matter
a
few
dollars
now
he
replied
sadly
in
three
months
that
the
pull
comes
we
walked
on
again
in
silence
not
without
a
shiver
even
at
the
poodle
dog
we
took
our
food
with
small
appetite
and
less
speech
and
it
was
not
until
he
was
warmed
with
a
third
glass
of
champagne
that
pinkerton
cleared
his
throat
and
looked
upon
me
with
a
deprecating
eye
said
he
was
a
subject
you
did
wish
to
be
referred
to
i
only
want
to
do
so
indirectly
it
he
faltered
because
you
were
dissatisfied
with
me
he
concluded
with
a
quaver
cried
i
no
not
a
word
just
now
he
hastened
to
proceed
me
speak
first
i
appreciate
though
i
ca
imitate
the
delicacy
of
your
nature
and
i
can
well
understand
you
would
rather
die
than
speak
of
it
and
yet
might
feel
disappointed
i
did
think
i
could
have
done
better
myself
but
when
i
found
how
tight
money
was
in
this
city
and
a
man
like
douglas
longhurst
a
the
man
that
stood
at
bay
in
a
corn
patch
for
five
hours
against
the
san
diablo
squatters
weakening
on
the
operation
i
tell
you
loudon
i
began
to
despair
and
i
may
have
made
mistakes
no
doubt
there
are
thousands
who
could
have
done
better
but
i
give
you
a
loyal
hand
on
it
i
did
my
poor
jim
said
i
if
i
ever
doubted
you
as
if
i
know
you
had
done
wonders
all
day
i
been
admiring
your
energy
and
resource
and
as
for
that
affair
loudon
no
more
not
a
word
more
i
do
want
to
hear
cried
jim
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
want
to
tell
you
said
i
it
a
thing
i
ashamed
loudon
o
do
say
that
do
use
such
an
expression
even
in
jest
protested
pinkerton
you
never
do
anything
you
ashamed
of
i
inquired
says
he
rolling
his
eyes
i
sometimes
sorry
afterwards
when
it
pans
out
different
from
what
i
figured
but
i
ca
see
what
i
would
want
to
be
ashamed
i
sat
a
while
considering
with
admiration
the
simplicity
of
my
character
then
i
sighed
you
know
jim
what
i
sorriest
for
said
i
this
rate
i
ca
be
best
man
at
your
marriage
he
repeated
echoing
the
sigh
marriage
for
me
now
i
going
right
down
to
break
it
to
her
i
think
that
shaken
me
all
day
i
feel
as
if
i
had
had
no
right
after
i
was
engaged
to
operate
so
you
know
jim
it
was
my
doing
and
you
must
lay
the
blame
on
me
said
i
a
cent
of
it
he
cried
was
as
eager
as
yourself
only
not
so
bright
at
the
beginning
no
i
myself
to
thank
for
it
but
it
a
while
jim
departed
on
his
dolorous
mission
i
returned
alone
to
the
office
lit
the
gas
and
sat
down
to
reflect
on
the
events
of
that
momentous
day
on
the
strange
features
of
the
tale
that
had
been
so
far
unfolded
the
disappearances
the
terrors
the
great
sums
of
money
and
on
the
dangerous
and
ungrateful
task
that
awaited
me
in
the
immediate
future
it
is
difficult
in
the
retrospect
of
such
affairs
to
avoid
attributing
to
ourselves
in
the
past
a
measure
of
the
knowledge
we
possess
but
i
may
say
and
yet
be
well
within
the
mark
that
i
was
consumed
that
night
with
a
fever
of
suspicion
and
curiosity
exhausted
my
fancy
in
solutions
which
i
still
dismissed
as
incommensurable
with
the
facts
and
in
the
mystery
by
which
i
saw
myself
surrounded
found
a
precious
stimulus
for
my
courage
and
a
convenient
soothing
draught
for
conscience
even
had
all
been
plain
sailing
i
do
not
hint
that
i
should
have
drawn
back
smuggling
is
one
of
the
meanest
of
crimes
for
by
that
we
rob
a
whole
country
pro
rata
and
are
therefore
certain
to
impoverish
the
poor
to
smuggle
opium
is
an
offence
particularly
dark
since
it
stands
related
not
so
much
to
murder
as
to
massacre
upon
all
these
points
i
was
quite
clear
my
sympathy
was
all
in
arms
against
my
interest
and
had
not
jim
been
involved
i
could
have
dwelt
almost
with
satisfaction
on
the
idea
of
my
failure
but
jim
his
whole
fortune
and
his
marriage
depended
upon
my
success
and
i
preferred
the
interests
of
my
friend
before
those
of
all
the
islanders
in
the
south
seas
this
is
a
poor
private
morality
if
you
like
but
it
is
mine
and
the
best
i
have
and
i
am
not
half
so
much
ashamed
of
having
embarked
at
all
on
this
adventure
as
i
am
proud
that
while
i
was
in
it
and
for
the
sake
of
my
friend
i
was
up
early
and
down
late
set
my
own
hand
to
everything
took
dangers
as
they
came
and
for
once
in
my
life
played
the
man
throughout
at
the
same
time
i
could
have
desired
another
field
of
energy
and
i
was
the
more
grateful
for
the
redeeming
element
of
mystery
without
that
though
i
might
have
gone
ahead
and
done
as
well
it
would
scarce
have
been
with
ardour
and
what
inspired
me
that
night
with
an
impatient
greed
of
the
sea
the
island
and
the
wreck
was
the
hope
that
i
might
stumble
there
upon
the
answer
to
a
hundred
questions
and
learn
why
captain
trent
fanned
his
red
face
in
the
exchange
and
why
dickson
fled
from
the
telephone
in
the
mission
street
chapter
xi
in
which
jim
and
i
take
different
ways
i
was
unhappy
when
i
closed
my
eyes
and
it
was
to
unhappiness
that
i
opened
them
again
next
morning
to
a
confused
sense
of
some
calamity
still
inarticulate
and
to
the
consciousness
of
jaded
limbs
and
of
a
swimming
head
i
must
have
lain
for
some
time
inert
and
stupidly
miserable
before
i
became
aware
of
a
reiterated
knocking
at
the
door
with
which
discovery
all
my
wits
flowed
back
in
their
accustomed
channels
and
i
remembered
the
sale
and
the
wreck
and
goddedaal
and
nares
and
johnson
and
black
tom
and
the
troubles
of
yesterday
and
the
manifold
engagements
of
the
day
that
was
to
come
the
thought
thrilled
me
like
a
trumpet
in
the
hour
of
battle
in
a
moment
i
had
leaped
from
bed
crossed
the
office
where
pinkerton
lay
in
a
deep
trance
of
sleep
on
the
convertible
sofa
and
stood
in
the
doorway
in
my
night
gear
to
receive
our
visitors
johnson
was
first
by
way
of
usher
smiling
from
a
little
behind
with
his
sunday
hat
tilted
forward
over
his
brow
and
a
cigar
glowing
between
his
lips
captain
nares
acknowledged
our
previous
acquaintance
with
a
succinct
nod
behind
him
again
in
the
top
of
the
stairway
a
knot
of
sailors
the
new
crew
of
the
norah
creina
stood
polishing
the
wall
with
back
and
elbow
these
i
left
without
to
their
reflections
but
our
two
officers
i
carried
at
once
into
the
office
where
taking
jim
by
the
shoulder
i
shook
him
slowly
into
consciousness
he
sat
up
all
abroad
for
the
moment
and
stared
on
the
new
captain
said
i
is
captain
nares
captain
nares
repeated
his
curt
nod
still
without
speech
and
i
thought
he
held
us
both
under
a
watchful
scrutiny
says
jim
is
captain
nares
is
it
good
morning
captain
nares
happy
to
have
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
sir
i
know
you
well
by
perhaps
under
the
circumstances
of
the
moment
this
was
scarce
a
welcome
speech
at
least
nares
received
it
with
a
grunt
captain
jim
continued
know
about
the
size
of
the
business
you
to
take
the
nora
creina
to
midway
island
break
up
a
wreck
call
at
honolulu
and
back
to
this
port
i
suppose
understood
returned
nares
with
the
same
unamiable
reserve
a
reason
which
i
guess
you
know
the
cruise
may
suit
me
but
there
a
point
or
two
to
settle
we
shall
have
to
talk
pinkerton
but
whether
i
go
or
not
somebody
will
there
no
sense
in
losing
time
and
you
might
give
johnson
a
note
let
him
take
the
hands
right
down
and
set
to
to
overhaul
the
rigging
the
beasts
look
sober
he
added
with
an
air
of
great
disgust
need
putting
to
work
to
keep
them
this
being
agreed
upon
nares
watched
his
subordinate
depart
and
drew
a
visible
breath
now
we
alone
and
can
talk
said
he
this
thing
about
it
been
advertised
like
barnum
museum
that
poster
of
yours
has
set
the
front
talking
that
an
objection
in
itself
for
i
laying
a
little
dark
just
now
and
anyway
before
i
take
the
ship
i
require
to
know
what
i
going
thereupon
pinkerton
gave
him
the
whole
tale
beginning
with
a
businesslike
precision
and
working
himself
up
as
he
went
on
to
the
of
narrative
enthusiasm
nares
sat
and
smoked
hat
still
on
head
and
acknowledged
each
fresh
feature
of
the
story
with
a
frowning
nod
but
his
pale
blue
eyes
betrayed
him
and
lighted
visibly
you
see
for
yourself
pinkerton
concluded
every
last
chance
that
trent
has
skipped
to
honolulu
and
it
wo
take
much
of
that
fifty
thousand
dollars
to
charter
a
smart
schooner
down
to
midway
here
where
i
want
a
man
cried
jim
with
contagious
energy
wreck
mine
i
paid
for
it
money
down
and
if
it
got
to
be
fought
for
i
want
to
see
it
fought
for
lively
if
you
not
back
in
ninety
days
i
tell
you
plainly
i
make
one
of
the
biggest
busts
ever
seen
upon
this
coast
it
life
or
death
for
dodd
and
me
as
like
as
not
it
come
to
grapples
on
the
island
and
when
i
heard
your
name
last
night
and
a
blame
sight
more
this
morning
when
i
saw
the
eye
got
in
your
head
i
said
is
good
enough
for
me
guess
observed
nares
studying
the
ash
of
his
cigar
sooner
i
get
that
schooner
outside
the
farallones
the
better
you
be
the
man
i
dreamed
of
cried
jim
bouncing
on
the
bed
not
five
per
cent
of
fraud
in
all
your
hold
on
said
nares
another
point
i
heard
some
talk
about
a
dodd
here
my
partner
said
jim
do
see
it
returned
the
captain
drily
captain
enough
for
any
ship
that
ever
i
was
do
you
start
disappointing
me
said
pinkerton
talking
without
thought
i
not
going
to
give
you
the
run
of
the
books
of
this
firm
am
i
i
guess
not
well
this
is
not
only
a
cruise
it
a
business
operation
and
that
in
the
hands
of
my
partner
you
sail
that
ship
you
see
to
breaking
up
that
wreck
and
keeping
the
men
upon
the
jump
and
you
find
your
hands
about
full
only
no
mistake
about
one
thing
it
has
to
be
done
to
dodd
satisfaction
for
it
dodd
that
accustomed
to
give
satisfaction
said
nares
with
a
dark
flush
so
you
will
here
cried
pinkerton
understand
you
prickly
to
handle
but
you
straight
all
position
got
to
be
understood
though
returned
nares
perhaps
a
trifle
mollified
position
i
mean
i
not
going
to
ship
it
enough
out
of
my
way
already
to
set
a
foot
on
this
mosquito
i
tell
you
retorted
jim
with
an
indescribable
twinkle
just
meet
me
on
the
ballast
and
we
make
it
a
nares
laughed
a
little
tactless
pinkerton
had
once
more
gained
a
victory
in
tact
there
another
point
resumed
the
captain
tacitly
relinquishing
the
last
about
the
owners
you
leave
that
to
me
i
one
of
longhurst
crowd
you
know
said
jim
with
sudden
bristling
vanity
man
that
good
enough
for
me
is
good
enough
for
are
they
asked
nares
and
spittal
said
jim
well
give
me
a
card
of
yours
said
the
captain
bother
to
write
i
keep
and
spittal
in
my
boast
for
boast
it
was
always
thus
with
nares
and
pinkerton
the
two
vainest
men
of
my
acquaintance
and
having
thus
reinstated
himself
in
his
own
opinion
the
captain
rose
and
with
a
couple
of
his
stiff
nods
departed
i
cried
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
do
like
that
just
got
to
loudon
returned
jim
a
typical
american
seaman
brave
as
a
lion
full
of
resource
and
stands
high
with
his
owners
he
a
man
with
a
brutality
at
sea
said
i
what
you
like
exclaimed
pinkerton
was
a
good
hour
we
got
him
in
i
trust
mamie
life
to
him
and
talking
of
mamie
says
jim
paused
with
his
trousers
half
on
the
gallantest
little
soul
god
ever
made
he
cried
i
meant
to
knock
you
up
last
night
and
i
hope
you
wo
take
it
unfriendly
that
i
did
i
went
in
and
looked
at
you
asleep
and
i
saw
you
were
all
broken
up
and
let
you
be
the
news
would
keep
anyway
and
even
you
loudon
could
feel
it
the
same
way
as
i
news
i
asked
this
way
says
jim
told
her
how
we
stood
and
that
i
backed
down
from
marrying
you
tired
of
me
says
she
god
bless
her
well
i
explained
the
whole
thing
over
again
the
chance
of
smash
your
absence
unavoidable
the
point
i
made
of
having
you
for
the
best
man
and
that
you
not
tired
of
me
i
think
i
see
one
way
to
manage
says
she
get
married
and
loudon
can
be
best
man
before
he
goes
to
sea
that
how
she
said
it
crisp
and
bright
like
one
of
dickens
characters
it
was
no
good
for
me
to
talk
about
the
smash
want
me
all
the
more
she
said
loudon
i
only
pray
i
can
make
it
up
to
her
i
prayed
for
it
last
night
beside
your
bed
while
you
lay
sleeping
for
you
and
mamie
and
myself
and
i
do
know
if
you
quite
believe
in
prayer
i
a
bit
ingersollian
myself
but
a
kind
of
sweetness
came
over
me
and
i
could
help
but
think
it
was
an
answer
never
was
a
man
so
lucky
you
and
me
and
mamie
it
a
triple
cord
loudon
if
either
of
you
were
to
die
and
she
likes
you
so
much
and
thinks
you
so
accomplished
and
and
was
just
as
set
as
i
was
to
have
you
for
best
man
loudon
she
calls
you
seems
to
me
so
friendly
and
she
sat
up
till
three
in
the
morning
fixing
up
a
costume
for
the
marriage
it
did
me
good
to
see
her
loudon
and
to
see
that
needle
going
going
and
to
say
this
hurry
jim
is
just
to
marry
you
i
could
believe
it
it
was
so
like
some
blame
fairy
story
to
think
of
those
old
times
about
turned
my
head
i
was
so
unrefined
then
and
so
illiterate
and
so
lonesome
and
here
i
am
in
clover
and
i
blamed
if
i
can
see
what
i
done
to
deserve
so
he
poured
forth
with
innocent
volubility
the
fulness
of
his
heart
and
i
from
these
irregular
communications
must
pick
out
here
a
little
and
there
a
little
the
particulars
of
his
new
plan
they
were
to
be
married
sure
enough
that
day
the
wedding
breakfast
was
to
be
at
frank
the
evening
to
be
passed
in
a
visit
of
aboard
the
norah
creina
and
then
we
were
to
part
jim
and
i
he
to
his
married
life
i
on
my
if
ever
i
cherished
an
for
miss
mamie
i
forgave
her
now
so
brave
and
kind
so
pretty
and
venturesome
was
her
decision
the
weather
frowned
overhead
with
a
leaden
sky
and
san
francisco
had
never
in
all
my
experience
looked
so
bleak
and
gaunt
and
shoddy
and
crazy
like
a
city
prematurely
old
but
through
all
my
wanderings
and
errands
to
and
fro
by
the
dock
side
or
in
the
jostling
street
among
rude
sounds
and
ugly
sights
there
ran
in
my
mind
like
a
tiny
strain
of
music
the
thought
of
my
friend
happiness
for
that
was
indeed
a
day
of
many
and
incongruous
occupations
breakfast
was
scarce
swallowed
before
jim
must
run
to
the
city
hall
and
about
the
cares
of
marriage
and
i
hurry
to
john
smith
upon
the
account
of
stores
and
thence
on
a
visit
of
certification
to
the
norah
creina
methought
she
looked
smaller
than
ever
sundry
great
ships
overspiring
her
from
close
without
she
was
already
a
nightmare
of
disorder
and
the
wharf
alongside
was
piled
with
a
world
of
casks
and
cases
and
tins
and
tools
and
coils
of
rope
and
miniature
barrels
of
giant
powder
such
as
it
seemed
no
human
ingenuity
could
stuff
on
board
of
her
johnson
was
in
the
waist
in
a
red
shirt
and
dungaree
trousers
his
eye
kindled
with
activity
with
him
i
exchanged
a
word
or
two
thence
stepped
aft
along
the
narrow
alleyway
between
the
house
and
the
rail
and
down
the
companion
to
the
main
cabin
where
the
captain
sat
with
the
commissioner
at
wine
i
gazed
with
disaffection
at
the
little
box
which
for
many
a
day
i
was
to
call
home
on
the
starboard
was
a
stateroom
for
the
captain
on
the
port
a
pair
of
frowsy
berths
one
over
the
other
and
abutting
astern
upon
the
side
of
an
unsavoury
cupboard
the
walls
were
yellow
and
damp
the
floor
black
and
greasy
there
was
a
prodigious
litter
of
straw
old
newspapers
and
broken
and
by
way
of
ornament
only
a
a
thermometer
presented
of
some
advertising
and
a
swinging
lamp
it
was
hard
to
foresee
that
before
a
week
was
up
i
should
regard
that
cabin
as
cheerful
lightsome
airy
and
even
spacious
i
was
presented
to
the
commissioner
and
to
a
young
friend
of
his
whom
he
had
brought
with
him
for
the
purpose
apparently
of
smoking
cigars
and
after
we
had
pledged
one
another
in
a
glass
of
california
port
a
trifle
sweet
and
sticky
for
a
morning
beverage
the
functionary
spread
his
papers
on
the
table
and
the
hands
were
summoned
down
they
trooped
accordingly
into
the
cabin
and
stood
eyeing
the
ceiling
or
the
floor
the
picture
of
sheepish
embarrassment
and
with
a
common
air
of
wanting
to
expectorate
and
not
quite
daring
in
admirable
contrast
stood
the
chinese
cook
easy
dignified
set
apart
by
spotless
raiment
the
hidalgo
of
the
seas
i
daresay
you
never
had
occasion
to
assist
at
the
farce
which
followed
our
shipping
laws
in
the
united
states
thanks
to
the
inimitable
dana
are
conceived
in
a
spirit
of
paternal
stringency
and
proceed
throughout
on
the
hypothesis
that
poor
jack
is
an
imbecile
and
the
other
parties
to
the
contract
rogues
and
ruffians
a
long
and
wordy
paper
of
precautions
a
bill
of
rights
must
be
read
separately
to
each
man
i
had
now
the
benefit
of
hearing
it
five
times
in
brisk
succession
and
you
would
suppose
i
was
acquainted
with
its
contents
but
the
commissioner
worthy
man
spends
his
days
in
doing
little
else
and
when
we
bear
in
mind
the
parallel
case
of
the
irreverent
curate
we
need
not
be
surprised
that
he
took
the
passage
tempo
prestissimo
in
one
roulade
of
gabble
that
i
with
the
trained
attention
of
an
educated
man
could
gather
but
a
fraction
of
its
import
and
the
sailors
nothing
no
profanity
in
giving
orders
no
midway
island
and
any
other
port
the
master
may
direct
not
to
exceed
six
calendar
months
and
to
this
port
to
be
paid
off
so
it
seemed
to
run
with
surprising
verbiage
so
ended
and
with
the
end
the
commissioner
in
each
case
fetched
a
deep
breath
resumed
his
natural
voice
and
proceeded
to
business
my
man
he
would
say
ship
a
at
so
many
dollars
american
gold
coin
sign
your
name
here
if
you
have
one
and
can
whereupon
and
the
name
with
infinite
hard
breathing
being
signed
the
commissioner
would
proceed
to
fill
in
the
man
appearance
height
on
the
official
form
in
this
task
of
literary
portraiture
he
seemed
to
rely
wholly
upon
temperament
for
i
could
not
perceive
him
to
cast
one
glance
on
any
of
his
models
he
was
assisted
however
by
a
running
commentary
from
the
captain
blue
and
eyes
red

seven
and

jests
as
old
presumably
as
the
american
marine
and
like
the
similar
pleasantries
of
the
billiard
board
perennially
relished
the
highest
note
of
humour
was
reached
in
the
case
of
the
chinese
cook
who
was
shipped
under
the
name
of
lung
to
the
sound
of
his
own
protests
and
the
chuckles
of
the
functionary
captain
said
the
latter
when
the
men
were
gone
and
he
had
bundled
up
his
papers
law
requires
you
to
carry
a
and
a
chest
of
guess
i
know
that
said
nares
guess
you
do
returned
the
commissioner
and
helped
himself
to
port
but
when
he
was
gone
i
appealed
to
nares
on
the
same
subject
for
i
was
well
aware
we
carried
none
of
these
provisions
drawled
nares
sixty
pounds
of
niggerhead
on
the
quay
is
there
and
twenty
pounds
of
salts
and
i
never
travel
without
some
painkiller
in
my
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
were
richer
the
captain
had
the
usual
provision
of
quack
medicines
with
which
in
the
usual
sailor
fashion
he
would
daily
drug
himself
displaying
an
extreme
inconstancy
and
flitting
from
kennedy
red
discovery
to
kennedy
white
and
from
hood
sarsaparilla
to
mother
seigel
syrup
and
there
were
besides
some
mildewed
and
bottles
the
labels
obliterated
over
which
nares
would
sometimes
sniff
and
speculate
to
smell
like
diarrhoea
stuff
he
would
remark
i
knew
and
i
would
try
but
the
was
indeed
represented
by
the
plugs
of
niggerhead
and
nothing
else
thus
paternal
laws
are
made
thus
they
are
evaded
and
the
schooner
put
to
sea
like
plenty
of
her
neighbours
liable
to
a
fine
of
six
hundred
dollars
this
characteristic
scene
which
has
delayed
me
overlong
was
but
a
moment
in
that
day
of
exercise
and
agitation
to
fit
out
a
schooner
for
sea
and
improvise
a
marriage
between
dawn
and
dusk
involves
heroic
effort
all
day
jim
and
i
ran
and
tramped
and
laughed
and
came
near
crying
and
fell
in
sudden
anxious
consultations
and
were
sped
with
a
prepared
sarcasm
on
our
lips
to
some
fallacious
milliner
and
made
dashes
to
the
schooner
and
john
smith
and
at
every
second
corner
were
reminded
by
our
own
huge
posters
of
our
desperate
estate
between
whiles
i
had
found
the
time
to
hover
at
some
windows
and
my
present
thus
intemperately
chosen
was
graciously
accepted
i
believe
indeed
that
was
the
last
though
not
the
least
of
my
concerns
before
the
old
minister
shabby
and
benign
was
routed
from
his
house
and
led
to
the
office
like
a
performing
poodle
and
there
in
the
growing
dusk
under
the
cold
glitter
of
thirteen
star
two
hundred
strong
and
beside
the
garish
glories
of
the
agricultural
engine
mamie
and
jim
were
made
one
the
scene
was
incongruous
but
the
business
pretty
whimsical
and
affecting
the
typewriters
with
such
kindly
faces
and
fine
posies
mamie
so
demure
and
jim
how
shall
i
describe
that
poor
transfigured
jim
he
began
by
taking
the
minister
aside
to
the
far
end
of
the
office
i
knew
not
what
he
said
but
i
have
reason
to
believe
he
was
protesting
his
unfitness
for
he
wept
as
he
said
it
and
the
old
minister
himself
genuinely
moved
was
heard
to
console
and
encourage
him
and
at
one
time
to
use
this
expression
assure
you
pinkerton
there
are
not
many
who
can
say
so
from
which
i
gathered
that
my
friend
had
tempered
his
with
at
least
one
legitimate
boast
from
this
ghostly
counselling
jim
turned
to
me
and
though
he
never
got
beyond
the
explosive
utterance
of
my
name
and
one
fierce
handgrip
communicated
some
of
his
own
emotion
like
a
charge
of
electricity
to
his
best
man
we
stood
up
to
the
ceremony
at
last
in
a
general
and
kindly
discomposure
jim
was
all
abroad
and
the
divine
himself
betrayed
his
sympathy
in
voice
and
demeanour
and
concluded
with
a
fatherly
allocution
in
which
he
congratulated
mamie
calling
her
upon
the
fortune
of
an
excellent
husband
and
protested
he
had
rarely
married
a
more
interesting
couple
at
this
stage
like
a
glory
descending
there
was
handed
in
ex
machina
the
card
of
douglas
longhurst
with
congratulations
and
four
dozen
a
bottle
was
opened
and
the
minister
pledged
the
bride
and
the
bridesmaids
simpered
and
tasted
and
i
made
a
speech
with
airy
bacchanalianism
glass
in
hand
but
poor
jim
must
leave
the
wine
untasted
touch
it
i
had
found
the
opportunity
to
whisper
your
state
it
will
make
you
as
drunk
as
a
and
jim
had
wrung
my
hand
with
a
bless
you
loudon
saved
me
again
hard
following
upon
this
the
supper
passed
off
at
frank
with
somewhat
tremulous
gaiety
and
thence
with
one
half
of
the
i
would
accept
no
more
we
voyaged
in
a
hack
to
the
norah
creina
a
dear
little
ship
cried
mamie
as
our
miniature
craft
was
pointed
out
to
her
and
then
on
second
thought
she
turned
to
the
best
man
how
brave
you
must
be
dodd
she
cried
go
in
that
tiny
thing
so
far
upon
the
ocean
and
i
perceived
i
had
risen
in
the
lady
estimation
the
dear
little
ship
presented
a
horrid
picture
of
confusion
and
its
occupants
of
weariness
and
from
the
cabin
the
cook
was
storing
tins
into
the
lazarette
and
the
four
hands
sweaty
and
sullen
were
passing
them
from
one
to
another
from
the
waist
johnson
was
three
parts
asleep
over
the
table
and
in
his
bunk
in
his
own
cabin
the
captain
sourly
chewed
and
puffed
at
a
cigar
here
he
said
rising
be
sorry
you
came
we
ca
stop
work
if
we
to
get
away
a
ship
getting
ready
for
sea
is
no
place
for
people
anyway
you
only
interrupt
my
i
was
on
the
point
of
answering
something
tart
but
jim
who
was
acquainted
with
the
breed
as
he
was
with
most
things
that
had
a
bearing
on
affairs
made
haste
to
pour
in
oil
he
said
know
we
a
nuisance
here
and
that
you
had
a
rough
time
but
all
we
want
is
that
you
should
drink
one
glass
of
wine
with
us
from
longhurst
on
the
occasion
of
my
marriage
and
loudon
dodd
it
your
lookout
said
nares
do
mind
half
an
hour
spell
o
he
added
to
the
men
and
kick
your
heels
for
half
an
hour
and
then
you
can
turn
to
again
a
trifle
livelier
johnson
see
if
you
ca
wipe
off
a
chair
for
the
his
tone
was
no
more
gracious
than
his
language
but
when
mamie
had
turned
upon
him
the
soft
fire
of
her
eyes
and
informed
him
that
he
was
the
first
she
had
ever
met
captains
of
steamers
of
she
so
qualified
the
statement
and
had
expressed
a
lively
sense
of
his
courage
and
perhaps
implied
for
i
suppose
the
arts
of
ladies
are
the
same
as
those
of
men
a
modest
consciousness
of
his
good
looks
our
bear
began
insensibly
to
soften
and
it
was
already
part
as
an
apology
though
still
with
unaffected
heat
of
temper
that
he
volunteered
some
sketch
of
his
annoyances
pretty
mess
we
had
said
he
the
stores
were
wrong
wring
john
smith
neck
for
him
some
of
these
days
then
two
newspaper
beasts
came
down
and
tried
to
raise
copy
out
of
me
till
i
threatened
them
with
the
first
thing
handy
and
then
some
kind
of
missionary
bug
wanting
to
work
his
passage
to
raiatea
or
somewhere
i
told
him
i
would
take
him
off
the
wharf
with
the
butt
end
of
my
boot
and
he
went
away
cursing
this
vessel
been
depreciated
by
the
look
of
while
the
captain
spoke
with
his
strange
humorous
arrogant
abruptness
i
observed
jim
to
be
sizing
him
up
like
a
thing
at
once
quaint
and
familiar
and
with
a
scrutiny
that
was
both
curious
and
knowing
word
dear
boy
he
said
turning
suddenly
to
me
and
when
he
had
drawn
me
on
deck
man
says
he
carry
sail
till
your
hair
grows
white
but
never
you
let
on
never
breathe
a
word
i
know
his
line
he
die
before
he
take
advice
and
if
you
get
his
back
up
he
run
you
right
under
i
do
often
jam
in
my
advice
loudon
and
when
i
do
it
means
i
thoroughly
the
little
party
in
the
cabin
so
disastrously
begun
finished
under
the
mellowing
influence
of
wine
and
woman
in
excellent
feeling
and
with
some
hilarity
mamie
in
a
plush
gainsborough
hat
and
a
gown
of
silk
sat
an
apparent
queen
among
her
rude
surroundings
and
companions
the
dusky
litter
of
the
cabin
set
off
her
radiant
trimness
tarry
johnson
was
a
foil
to
her
fair
beauty
she
glowed
in
that
poor
place
fair
as
a
star
until
even
i
who
was
not
usually
of
her
admirers
caught
a
spark
of
admiration
and
even
the
captain
who
was
in
no
courtly
humour
proposed
that
the
scene
should
be
commemorated
by
my
pencil
it
was
the
last
act
of
the
evening
hurriedly
as
i
went
about
my
task
the
had
lengthened
out
to
more
than
three
before
it
was
completed
mamie
in
full
value
the
rest
of
the
party
figuring
in
outline
only
and
the
artist
himself
introduced
in
a
back
view
which
was
pronounced
a
likeness
but
it
was
to
mamie
that
i
devoted
the
best
of
my
attention
and
it
was
with
her
i
made
my
chief
success
she
cried
i
really
like
that
no
wonder
jim
she
paused
it
just
as
lovely
as
he
good
she
cried
an
epigram
which
was
appreciated
and
repeated
as
we
made
our
salutations
and
called
out
after
the
retreating
couple
as
they
passed
away
under
the
lamplight
on
the
wharf
thus
it
was
that
our
farewells
were
smuggled
through
under
an
ambuscade
of
laughter
and
the
parting
over
ere
i
knew
it
was
begun
the
figures
vanished
the
steps
died
away
along
the
silent
city
front
on
board
the
men
had
returned
to
their
labours
the
captain
to
his
solitary
cigar
and
after
that
long
and
complex
day
of
business
and
emotion
i
was
at
last
alone
and
free
it
was
perhaps
chiefly
fatigue
that
made
my
heart
so
heavy
i
leaned
at
least
upon
the
house
and
stared
at
the
foggy
heaven
or
over
the
rail
at
the
wavering
reflection
of
the
lamps
like
a
man
that
was
quite
done
with
hope
and
would
have
welcomed
the
asylum
of
the
grave
and
all
at
once
as
i
thus
stood
the
city
of
pekin
flashed
into
my
mind
racing
her
thirteen
knots
for
honolulu
with
the
hated
trent
perhaps
with
the
mysterious
goddedaal
on
board
and
with
the
thought
the
blood
leaped
and
careered
through
all
my
body
it
seemed
no
chase
at
all
it
seemed
we
had
no
chance
as
we
lay
there
bound
to
iron
pillars
and
fooling
away
the
precious
moments
over
tins
of
beans
them
get
there
first
i
thought
them
we
ca
be
long
and
from
that
moment
i
date
myself
a
man
of
a
rounded
experience
nothing
had
lacked
but
this
that
i
should
entertain
and
welcome
the
grim
thought
of
bloodshed
it
was
long
before
the
toil
remitted
in
the
cabin
and
it
was
worth
my
while
to
get
to
bed
long
after
that
before
sleep
favoured
me
and
scarce
a
moment
later
or
so
it
seemed
when
i
was
recalled
to
consciousness
by
bawling
men
and
the
jar
of
straining
hawsers
the
schooner
was
cast
off
before
i
got
on
deck
in
the
misty
obscurity
of
the
first
dawn
i
saw
the
tug
heading
us
with
glowing
fires
and
blowing
smoke
and
heard
her
beat
the
roughened
waters
of
the
bay
beside
us
on
her
flock
of
hills
the
lighted
city
towered
up
and
stood
swollen
in
the
raw
fog
it
was
strange
to
see
her
burn
on
thus
wastefully
with
luminaries
when
the
dawn
was
already
grown
strong
enough
to
show
me
and
to
suffer
me
to
recognise
a
solitary
figure
standing
by
the
piles
or
was
it
really
the
eye
and
not
rather
the
heart
that
identified
that
shadow
in
the
dusk
among
the
shoreside
lamps
i
know
not
it
was
jim
at
least
jim
come
for
a
last
look
and
we
had
but
time
to
wave
a
valedictory
gesture
and
exchange
a
wordless
cry
this
was
our
second
parting
and
our
capacities
were
now
reversed
it
was
mine
to
play
the
argonaut
to
speed
affairs
to
plan
and
to
accomplish
if
need
were
at
the
price
of
life
it
was
his
to
sit
at
home
to
study
the
calendar
and
to
wait
i
knew
besides
another
thing
that
gave
me
joy
i
knew
that
my
friend
had
succeeded
in
my
education
that
the
romance
of
business
if
our
fantastic
purchase
merited
the
name
had
at
last
stirred
my
dilletante
nature
and
as
we
swept
under
cloudy
tamalpais
and
through
the
roaring
narrows
of
the
bay
the
yankee
blood
sang
in
my
veins
with
suspense
and
exultation
outside
the
heads
as
if
to
meet
my
desire
we
found
it
blowing
fresh
from
the
northeast
no
time
had
been
lost
the
sun
was
not
yet
up
before
the
tug
cast
off
the
hawser
gave
us
a
salute
of
three
whistles
and
turned
homeward
toward
the
coast
which
now
began
to
gleam
along
its
margin
with
the
earliest
rays
of
day
there
was
no
other
ship
in
view
when
the
norah
creina
lying
over
under
all
plain
sail
began
her
long
and
lonely
voyage
to
the
wreck
chapter
xii
the
i
love
to
recall
the
glad
monotony
of
a
pacific
voyage
when
the
trades
are
not
stinted
and
the
ship
day
after
day
goes
free
the
mountain
scenery
of
clouds
watched
and
in
my
case
painted
under
every
vicissitude
of
light
blotting
stars
withering
in
the
glory
barring
the
scarlet
eve
lying
across
the
dawn
collapsed
into
the
unfeatured
morning
bank
or
at
noon
raising
their
snowy
summits
between
the
blue
roof
of
heaven
and
the
blue
floor
of
sea
the
small
busy
and
deliberate
world
of
the
schooner
with
its
unfamiliar
scenes
the
spearing
of
dolphin
from
the
bowsprit
end
the
holy
war
on
sharks
the
cook
making
bread
on
the
main
hatch
reefing
down
before
a
violent
squall
with
the
men
hanging
out
on
the
the
squall
itself
the
catch
at
the
heart
the
opened
sluices
of
the
sky
and
the
relief
the
renewed
loveliness
of
life
when
all
is
over
the
sun
forth
again
and
our
enemy
only
a
blot
upon
the
leeward
sea
i
love
to
recall
and
would
that
i
could
reproduce
that
life
the
unforgettable
the
unrememberable
the
memory
which
shows
so
wise
a
backwardness
in
registering
pain
is
besides
an
imperfect
recorder
of
extended
pleasures
and
a
escapes
as
it
were
by
its
mass
our
petty
methods
of
commemoration
on
a
part
of
our
life
map
there
lies
a
roseate
undecipherable
haze
and
that
is
all
of
one
thing
if
i
am
at
all
to
trust
my
own
annals
i
was
delightedly
conscious
day
after
day
in
the
cabin
the
thermometer
stood
at
day
after
day
the
air
had
the
same
indescribable
liveliness
and
sweetness
soft
and
nimble
and
cool
as
the
cheek
of
health
day
after
day
the
sun
flamed
night
after
night
the
moon
beaconed
or
the
stars
paraded
their
lustrous
regiment
i
was
aware
of
a
spiritual
change
or
perhaps
rather
a
molecular
reconstitution
my
bones
were
sweeter
to
me
i
had
come
home
to
my
own
climate
and
looked
back
with
pity
on
those
damp
and
wintry
zones
miscalled
the
temperate
years
of
this
and
comfortable
quarters
to
live
in
kind
of
shake
the
grit
out
of
a
man
the
captain
remarked
make
out
to
be
happy
anywhere
else
a
townie
of
mine
was
lost
down
this
way
in
a
coalship
that
took
fire
at
sea
he
struck
the
beach
somewhere
in
the
navigators
and
he
wrote
to
me
that
when
he
left
the
place
it
would
be
feet
first
he
well
off
too
and
his
father
owns
some
coasting
craft
down
east
but
billy
prefers
the
beach
and
hot
rolls
off
the
a
voice
told
me
i
was
on
the
same
track
as
billy
but
when
was
this
our
outward
track
in
the
norah
creina
lay
well
to
the
northward
and
perhaps
it
is
but
the
impression
of
a
few
pet
days
which
i
have
unconsciously
spread
longer
or
perhaps
the
feeling
grew
upon
me
later
in
the
run
to
honolulu
one
thing
i
am
sure
it
was
before
i
had
ever
seen
an
island
worthy
of
the
name
that
i
must
date
my
loyalty
to
the
south
seas
the
blank
sea
itself
grew
desirable
under
such
skies
and
wherever
the
blows
i
know
no
better
country
than
a
schooner
deck
but
for
the
tugging
anxiety
as
to
the
journey
end
the
journey
itself
must
thus
have
counted
for
the
best
of
holidays
my
physical
was
effects
of
sea
and
sky
kept
me
for
ever
busy
with
my
pencil
and
i
had
no
lack
of
intellectual
exercise
of
a
different
order
in
the
study
of
my
inconsistent
friend
the
captain
i
call
him
friend
here
on
the
threshold
but
that
is
to
look
well
ahead
at
first
i
was
too
much
horrified
by
what
i
considered
his
barbarities
too
much
puzzled
by
his
shifting
humours
and
too
frequently
annoyed
by
his
small
vanities
to
regard
him
otherwise
than
as
the
cross
of
my
existence
it
was
only
by
degrees
in
his
rare
hours
of
pleasantness
when
he
forgot
and
made
me
forget
the
weaknesses
to
which
he
was
so
prone
that
he
won
me
to
a
kind
of
unconsenting
fondness
lastly
the
faults
were
all
embraced
in
a
more
generous
view
i
saw
them
in
their
place
like
discords
in
a
musical
progression
and
accepted
them
and
found
them
picturesque
as
we
accept
and
admire
in
the
habitable
face
of
nature
the
smoky
head
of
the
volcano
or
the
pernicious
thicket
of
the
swamp
he
was
come
of
good
people
down
east
and
had
the
beginnings
of
a
thorough
education
his
temper
had
been
ungovernable
from
the
first
and
it
is
likely
the
defect
was
inherited
and
the
blame
of
the
rupture
not
entirely
his
he
ran
away
at
least
to
sea
suffered
horrible
maltreatment
which
seemed
to
have
rather
hardened
than
enlightened
him
ran
away
again
to
shore
in
a
south
american
port
proved
his
capacity
and
made
money
although
still
a
child
fell
among
thieves
and
was
robbed
worked
back
a
passage
to
the
states
and
knocked
one
morning
at
the
door
of
an
old
lady
whose
orchard
he
had
often
robbed
the
introduction
appears
insufficient
but
nares
knew
what
he
was
doing
the
sight
of
her
old
neighbourly
depredator
shivering
at
the
door
in
tatters
the
very
oddity
of
his
appeal
touched
a
soft
spot
in
the
spinster
heart
always
had
a
fancy
for
the
old
lady
nares
said
when
she
used
to
stampede
me
out
of
the
orchard
and
shake
her
thimble
and
her
old
curls
at
me
out
of
the
window
as
i
was
going
by
i
always
thought
she
was
a
kind
of
pleasant
old
girl
well
when
she
came
to
the
door
that
morning
i
told
her
so
and
that
i
was
and
she
took
me
right
in
and
fetched
out
the
she
clothed
him
taught
him
and
had
him
to
sea
again
in
better
shape
welcomed
him
to
her
hearth
on
his
return
from
every
cruise
and
when
she
died
bequeathed
him
her
possessions
was
a
good
old
girl
he
would
say
tell
you
dodd
it
was
a
queer
thing
to
see
me
and
the
old
lady
talking
a
pasear
in
the
garden
and
the
old
man
scowling
at
us
over
the
pickets
she
lived
right
next
door
to
the
old
man
and
i
guess
that
just
what
took
me
there
i
wanted
him
to
know
that
i
was
badly
beat
you
see
and
would
rather
go
to
the
devil
than
to
him
what
made
the
dig
harder
he
had
quarrelled
with
the
old
lady
about
me
and
the
orchard
i
guess
that
made
him
rage
yes
i
was
a
beast
when
i
was
young
but
i
was
always
pretty
good
to
the
old
since
then
he
had
prospered
not
uneventfully
in
his
profession
the
old
lady
money
had
fallen
in
during
the
voyage
of
the
gleaner
and
he
was
now
as
soon
as
the
smoke
of
that
engagement
cleared
away
secure
of
his
ship
i
suppose
he
was
about
thirty
a
powerful
active
man
with
a
blue
eye
a
thick
head
of
hair
about
the
colour
of
oakum
and
growing
low
over
the
brow
and
lean
about
the
jaw
a
good
singer
a
good
performer
on
that
the
accordion
a
quick
observer
a
close
reasoner
when
he
pleased
of
a
really
elegant
address
and
when
he
chose
the
greatest
brute
upon
the
seas
his
usage
of
the
men
his
hazing
his
bullying
his
perpetual
for
no
cause
his
perpetual
and
brutal
sarcasm
might
have
raised
a
mutiny
in
a
slave
galley
suppose
the
steersman
eye
to
have
wandered
little
dutchman
nares
would
bawl
want
a
booting
to
keep
you
on
your
course
i
know
a
little
slush
when
i
see
one
just
you
glue
your
eye
to
that
compass
or
i
show
you
round
the
vessel
at
the
of
my
or
suppose
a
hand
to
linger
aft
whither
he
had
perhaps
been
summoned
not
a
minute
before
daniells
will
you
oblige
me
by
stepping
clear
of
that
the
captain
might
begin
with
truculent
courtesy
you
and
perhaps
you
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
what
the
hell
you
doing
on
my
i
want
no
dirt
of
your
sort
here
is
there
nothing
for
you
to
do
where
the
mate
do
you
set
me
to
find
work
for
you
or
i
find
you
some
that
will
keep
you
on
your
back
a
such
allocutions
conceived
with
a
perfect
knowledge
of
his
audience
so
that
every
insult
carried
home
were
delivered
with
a
mien
so
menacing
and
an
eye
so
fiercely
cruel
that
his
unhappy
subordinates
shrank
and
quailed
too
often
violence
followed
too
often
i
have
heard
and
seen
and
boiled
at
the
cowardly
aggression
and
the
victim
his
hands
bound
by
law
has
risen
again
from
deck
and
crawled
forward
stupefied
i
know
not
what
passion
of
revenge
in
his
wronged
heart
it
seems
strange
i
should
have
grown
to
like
this
tyrant
it
may
even
seem
strange
that
i
should
have
stood
by
and
suffered
his
excesses
to
proceed
but
i
was
not
quite
such
a
chicken
as
to
interfere
in
public
for
i
would
rather
have
a
man
or
two
mishandled
than
one
half
of
us
butchered
in
a
mutiny
and
the
rest
suffer
on
the
gallows
and
in
private
i
was
unceasing
in
my
protests
i
once
said
to
him
appealing
to
his
patriotism
which
was
of
a
hardy
quality
is
no
way
to
treat
american
seamen
you
call
it
american
to
treat
men
like
dogs
he
said
grimly
you
call
these
dutchmen
and
scattermouches
americans
i
been
fourteen
years
to
sea
all
but
one
trip
under
american
colours
and
i
never
laid
eye
on
an
american
foremast
hand
there
used
to
be
such
things
in
the
old
days
when
dollars
were
the
wages
out
of
boston
and
then
you
could
see
ships
handled
and
run
the
way
they
want
to
be
but
that
all
past
and
gone
and
nowadays
the
only
thing
that
flies
in
an
american
ship
is
a
you
do
know
you
have
a
guess
how
would
you
like
to
go
on
deck
for
your
middle
watch
fourteen
months
on
end
with
all
your
duty
to
do
and
every
one
life
depending
on
you
and
expect
to
get
a
knife
ripped
into
you
as
you
come
out
of
your
stateroom
or
be
as
you
pass
the
boat
or
get
tripped
into
the
hold
if
the
hatches
are
off
in
fine
weather
that
kind
of
shakes
the
starch
out
of
the
brotherly
love
and
new
jerusalem
business
you
go
through
the
mill
and
you
have
a
bigger
grudge
against
every
old
shellback
that
dirties
his
plate
in
the
three
oceans
than
the
bank
of
california
could
settle
up
no
it
has
an
ugly
look
to
it
but
the
only
way
to
run
a
ship
is
to
make
yourself
a
in
pacific
dutchman
includes
all
teutons
and
folk
from
the
basin
of
the
baltic
scattermouch
all
latins
and
levantines
captain
said
i
are
degrees
in
everything
you
know
american
ships
have
a
bad
name
you
know
perfectly
well
if
it
was
for
the
high
wage
and
the
good
food
there
not
a
man
would
ship
in
one
if
he
could
help
and
even
as
it
is
some
prefer
a
british
ship
beastly
food
and
the
said
he
plenty
booting
in
i
guess
though
i
do
deny
but
what
some
of
them
are
and
with
that
he
smiled
like
a
man
recalling
something
here
that
brings
a
yarn
in
my
head
he
resumed
for
the
sake
of
the
joke
i
give
myself
away
it
was
in
i
shipped
mate
in
the
british
ship
maria
from
for
melbourne
she
was
the
queerest
craft
in
some
ways
that
ever
i
was
aboard
of
the
food
was
a
caution
there
was
nothing
fit
to
put
your
lips
to
but
the
which
was
from
the
end
bin
no
doubt
it
used
to
make
me
sick
to
see
the
men
dinners
and
sorry
to
see
my
own
the
old
man
was
good
enough
i
guess
green
was
his
name
a
mild
fatherly
old
galoot
but
the
hands
were
the
lowest
gang
i
ever
handled
and
whenever
i
tried
to
knock
a
little
spirit
into
them
the
old
man
took
their
part
it
was
gilbert
and
sullivan
on
the
high
seas
but
you
bet
i
would
let
any
man
dictate
to
me
give
me
your
orders
captain
green
i
said
you
find
i
carry
them
out
that
all
you
got
to
say
you
find
i
do
my
duty
i
said
i
do
it
is
my
lookout
and
there
no
man
born
that
going
to
give
me
lessons
well
there
was
plenty
dirt
on
board
that
maria
first
and
last
of
course
the
old
man
put
my
back
up
and
of
course
he
put
up
the
crew
and
i
had
to
regular
fight
my
way
through
every
watch
the
men
got
to
hate
me
so
i
would
hear
them
grit
their
teeth
when
i
came
up
at
last
one
day
i
saw
a
big
hulking
beast
of
a
dutchman
booting
the
ship
boy
i
made
one
shoot
of
it
off
the
house
and
laid
that
dutchman
out
up
he
came
and
i
laid
him
out
again
i
said
there
a
kick
left
in
you
just
mention
it
and
i
stamp
your
ribs
in
like
a
he
thought
better
of
it
and
never
let
on
lay
there
as
mild
as
a
deacon
at
a
funeral
and
they
took
him
below
to
reflect
on
his
native
dutchland
one
night
we
got
caught
in
rather
a
dirty
thing
about
south
i
guess
we
were
all
asleep
for
the
first
thing
i
knew
there
was
the
gone
i
ran
forward
bawling
blue
hell
and
just
as
i
came
by
the
foremast
something
struck
me
right
through
the
forearm
and
stuck
there
i
put
my
other
hand
up
and
by
george
it
was
the
grain
the
beasts
had
speared
me
like
a
porpoise
i
wrong
says
grained
me
says
you
says
he
i
been
looking
for
that
by
god
i
cried
want
to
have
some
of
these
beasts
murdered
for
it
nares
says
he
better
go
below
if
i
had
been
one
of
the
men
you
have
got
more
than
this
and
i
want
no
more
of
your
language
on
deck
you
cost
me
my
already
says
he
if
you
carry
on
you
have
the
three
sticks
out
of
her
that
was
old
man
green
idea
of
supporting
officers
but
you
wait
a
bit
the
coming
we
made
melbourne
right
enough
and
the
old
man
said
nares
you
and
me
do
draw
together
you
a
seaman
no
mistake
of
that
but
you
the
most
disagreeable
man
i
ever
sailed
with
and
your
language
and
your
conduct
to
the
crew
i
can
not
stomach
i
guess
we
separate
i
did
care
about
the
berth
you
may
be
sure
but
i
felt
kind
of
mean
and
if
he
made
one
kind
of
stink
i
thought
i
could
make
another
so
i
said
i
would
go
ashore
and
see
how
things
stood
went
found
i
was
all
right
and
came
aboard
again
on
the
top
you
getting
your
traps
together
mr
nares
says
the
old
says
i
do
know
as
we
separate
much
before
at
least
i
said
a
point
for
your
consideration
i
very
willing
to
say
to
the
maria
but
i
do
know
whether
care
to
start
me
out
with
three
months
wages
he
got
his
right
away
son
says
he
think
it
cheap
at
the
money
he
had
me
it
was
a
singular
tale
for
a
man
to
tell
of
himself
above
all
in
the
midst
of
our
discussion
but
it
was
quite
in
character
for
nares
i
never
made
a
good
hit
in
our
disputes
i
never
justly
resented
any
act
or
speech
of
his
but
what
i
found
it
long
after
carefully
posted
in
his
and
reckoned
here
was
the
man
oddity
to
my
credit
it
was
the
same
with
his
father
whom
he
had
hated
he
would
give
a
sketch
of
the
old
fellow
frank
and
credible
and
yet
so
honestly
touched
that
it
was
charming
i
have
never
met
a
man
so
strangely
constituted
to
possess
a
reason
of
the
most
equal
justice
to
have
his
nerves
at
the
same
time
quivering
with
petty
spite
and
to
act
upon
the
nerves
and
not
the
reason
a
kindred
wonder
in
my
eyes
was
the
nature
of
his
courage
there
was
never
a
braver
man
he
went
out
to
welcome
danger
an
emergency
came
it
never
so
sudden
strung
him
like
a
tonic
and
yet
upon
the
other
hand
i
have
known
none
so
nervous
so
oppressed
with
possibilities
looking
upon
the
world
at
large
and
the
life
of
a
sailor
in
particular
with
so
constant
and
haggard
a
consideration
of
the
ugly
chances
all
his
courage
was
in
blood
not
merely
cold
but
icy
with
reasoned
apprehension
he
would
lay
our
little
craft
rail
under
and
in
a
squall
until
i
gave
myself
up
for
lost
and
the
men
were
rushing
to
their
stations
of
their
own
accord
he
would
say
guess
there
not
a
man
on
board
would
have
hung
on
as
long
as
i
did
that
time
they
have
to
give
up
thinking
me
no
schooner
sailor
i
guess
i
can
shave
just
as
near
capsizing
as
any
other
captain
of
this
vessel
drunk
or
and
then
he
would
fall
to
repining
and
wishing
himself
well
out
of
the
enterprise
and
dilate
on
the
peril
of
the
seas
the
particular
dangers
of
the
schooner
rig
which
he
abhorred
the
various
ways
in
which
we
might
go
to
the
bottom
and
the
prodigious
fleet
of
ships
that
have
sailed
out
in
the
course
of
history
dwindled
from
the
eyes
of
watchers
and
returned
no
more
he
would
wind
up
guess
it
do
much
matter
i
ca
see
what
any
one
wants
to
live
for
anyway
if
i
could
get
into
some
one
else
and
be
about
twelve
years
old
and
just
stick
the
way
i
was
eating
stolen
apples
i
wo
say
but
there
no
sense
in
this
business
sailorising
politics
the
piety
mill
and
all
the
rest
of
it
good
clean
drowning
is
good
enough
for
it
is
hard
to
imagine
any
more
depressing
talk
for
a
poor
landsman
on
a
dirty
night
it
is
hard
to
imagine
anything
less
as
sailors
are
supposed
to
be
and
generally
are
than
this
persistent
harping
on
the
minor
but
i
was
to
see
more
of
the
man
gloomy
constancy
ere
the
cruise
was
at
an
end
on
the
morning
of
the
seventeenth
day
i
came
on
deck
to
find
the
schooner
under
double
reefs
and
flying
rather
wild
before
a
heavy
run
of
sea
snoring
trades
and
humming
sails
had
been
our
portion
hitherto
we
were
already
nearing
the
island
my
restrained
excitement
had
begun
again
to
overmaster
me
and
for
some
time
my
only
book
had
been
the
patent
log
that
trailed
over
the
taffrail
and
my
chief
interest
the
daily
observation
and
our
caterpillar
progress
across
the
chart
my
first
glance
which
was
at
the
compass
and
my
second
which
was
at
the
log
were
all
that
i
could
wish
we
lay
our
course
we
had
been
doing
over
eight
since
nine
the
night
before
and
i
drew
a
heavy
breath
of
satisfaction
and
then
i
know
not
what
odd
and
wintry
appearance
of
the
sea
and
sky
knocked
suddenly
at
my
heart
i
observed
the
schooner
to
look
more
than
usually
small
the
men
silent
and
studious
of
the
weather
nares
in
one
of
his
rusty
humours
afforded
me
no
shadow
of
a
morning
salutation
he
too
seemed
to
observe
the
behaviour
of
the
ship
with
an
intent
and
anxious
scrutiny
what
i
liked
still
less
johnson
himself
was
at
the
wheel
which
he
span
busily
often
with
a
visible
effort
and
as
the
seas
ranged
up
behind
us
black
and
imminent
he
kept
casting
behind
him
eyes
of
animal
swiftness
and
drawing
in
his
neck
between
his
shoulders
like
a
man
dodging
a
blow
from
these
signs
i
gathered
that
all
was
not
exactly
for
the
best
and
i
would
have
given
a
good
handful
of
dollars
for
a
plain
answer
to
the
questions
which
i
dared
not
put
had
i
dared
with
the
present
danger
signal
in
the
captain
face
i
should
only
have
been
reminded
of
my
position
as
supercargo
an
office
never
touched
upon
in
kindness
and
advised
in
a
very
indigestible
manner
to
go
below
there
was
nothing
for
it
therefore
but
to
entertain
my
vague
apprehensions
as
best
i
should
be
able
until
it
pleased
the
captain
to
enlighten
me
of
his
own
accord
this
he
did
sooner
than
i
had
expected
as
soon
indeed
as
the
chinaman
had
summoned
us
to
breakfast
and
we
sat
face
to
face
across
the
narrow
board
here
dodd
he
began
looking
at
me
rather
queerly
is
a
business
point
arisen
this
sea
been
running
up
for
the
last
two
days
and
now
it
too
high
for
comfort
the
glass
is
falling
the
wind
is
breezing
up
and
i
wo
say
but
what
there
dirt
in
it
if
i
lay
her
to
we
may
have
to
ride
out
a
gale
of
wind
and
drift
god
knows
where
on
these
french
frigate
shoals
for
instance
if
i
keep
her
as
she
goes
we
make
that
island
afternoon
and
have
the
lee
of
it
to
lie
under
if
we
ca
make
out
to
run
in
the
point
you
have
to
figure
on
is
whether
you
take
the
big
chances
of
that
captain
trent
making
the
place
before
you
or
take
the
risk
of
something
happening
to
run
this
ship
to
your
satisfaction
he
added
with
an
ugly
sneer
here
a
point
for
the
i
returned
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
is
better
than
certain
is
all
risk
dodd
he
remarked
there
one
thing
now
or
never
in
half
an
hour
archdeacon
gabriel
could
lay
her
to
if
he
came
down
stairs
on
right
said
i
goes
said
he
and
with
that
he
fell
to
breakfast
and
passed
half
an
hour
in
stowing
away
pie
and
devoutly
wishing
himself
back
in
san
francisco
when
we
came
on
deck
again
he
took
the
wheel
from
johnson
it
appears
they
could
trust
none
among
the
hands
and
i
stood
close
beside
him
feeling
safe
in
this
proximity
and
tasting
a
fearful
joy
from
our
surroundings
and
the
consciousness
of
my
decision
the
breeze
had
already
risen
and
as
it
tore
over
our
heads
it
uttered
at
times
a
long
hooting
note
that
sent
my
heart
into
my
boots
the
sea
pursued
us
without
remission
leaping
to
the
assault
of
the
low
rail
the
was
all
awash
and
we
must
close
the
companion
doors
all
this
if
you
please
for
pinkerton
dollars
the
captain
suddenly
exclaimed
many
a
fine
fellow
gone
under
dodd
because
of
drivers
like
your
friend
what
do
they
care
for
a
ship
or
two
insured
i
guess
what
do
they
care
for
sailors
lives
alongside
of
a
few
thousand
dollars
what
they
want
is
speed
between
ports
and
a
damned
fool
of
a
captain
that
drive
a
ship
under
as
i
doing
this
one
you
can
put
in
the
morning
asking
why
i
do
i
sheered
off
to
another
part
of
the
vessel
as
fast
as
civility
permitted
this
was
not
at
all
the
talk
that
i
desired
nor
was
the
train
of
reflection
which
it
started
anyway
welcome
here
i
was
running
some
hazard
of
my
life
and
perilling
the
lives
of
seven
others
exactly
for
what
end
i
was
now
at
liberty
to
ask
myself
for
a
very
large
amount
of
a
very
deadly
poison
was
the
obvious
answer
and
i
thought
if
all
tales
were
true
and
i
were
soon
to
be
subjected
to
at
the
bar
of
eternal
justice
it
was
one
which
would
not
increase
my
popularity
with
the
court
never
mind
jim
thought
i
doing
it
for
before
eleven
a
third
reef
was
taken
in
the
mainsail
and
johnson
filled
the
cabin
with
a
of
no
duck
and
sat
on
the
streaming
floor
vigorously
putting
it
to
rights
with
a
couple
of
the
hands
by
dinner
i
had
fled
the
deck
and
sat
in
the
bench
corner
giddy
dumb
and
stupefied
with
terror
the
frightened
leaps
of
the
poor
norah
creina
spanking
like
a
stag
for
bare
existence
bruised
me
between
the
table
and
the
berths
overhead
the
wild
huntsman
of
the
storm
passed
continuously
in
one
blare
of
mingled
noises
screaming
wind
straining
timber
lashing
rope
end
pounding
block
and
bursting
sea
contributed
and
i
could
have
thought
there
was
at
times
another
a
more
piercing
a
more
human
note
that
dominated
all
like
the
wailing
of
an
angel
i
could
have
thought
i
knew
the
angel
name
and
that
his
wings
were
black
it
seemed
incredible
that
any
creature
of
man
art
could
long
endure
the
barbarous
mishandling
of
the
seas
kicked
as
the
schooner
was
from
mountain
side
to
mountain
side
beaten
and
blown
upon
and
wrenched
in
every
joint
and
sinew
like
a
child
upon
the
rack
there
was
not
a
plank
of
her
that
did
not
cry
aloud
for
mercy
and
as
she
continued
to
hold
together
i
became
conscious
of
a
growing
sympathy
with
her
endeavours
a
growing
admiration
for
her
gallant
staunchness
that
amused
and
at
times
obliterated
my
terrors
for
myself
god
bless
every
man
that
swung
a
mallet
on
that
tiny
and
strong
hull
it
was
not
for
wages
only
that
he
laboured
but
to
save
men
lives
all
the
rest
of
the
day
and
all
the
following
night
i
sat
in
the
corner
or
lay
wakeful
in
my
bunk
and
it
was
only
with
the
return
of
morning
that
a
new
phase
of
my
alarms
drove
me
once
more
on
deck
a
gloomier
interval
i
never
passed
johnson
and
nares
steadily
relieved
each
other
at
the
wheel
and
came
below
the
first
glance
of
each
was
at
the
glass
which
he
repeatedly
knuckled
and
frowned
upon
for
it
was
sagging
lower
all
the
time
then
if
johnson
were
the
visitor
he
would
pick
a
snack
out
of
the
cupboard
and
stand
braced
against
the
table
eating
it
and
perhaps
obliging
me
with
a
word
or
two
of
his
conversation
how
it
was
son
of
a
gun
of
a
cold
night
on
deck
with
a
grin
how
was
no
night
for
panjammers
he
could
tell
having
transacted
all
which
he
would
throw
himself
down
in
his
bunk
and
sleep
his
two
hours
with
compunction
but
the
captain
neither
ate
nor
slept
there
dodd
he
would
say
after
the
obligatory
visit
to
the
glass
my
son
we
one
hundred
and
four
or
whatever
it
was
the
island
and
scudding
for
all
worth
we
make
it
about
four
or
not
as
the
case
may
be
that
the
news
and
now
dodd
i
stretched
a
point
for
you
you
can
see
i
dead
tired
so
just
you
stretch
away
back
to
your
bunk
and
with
this
attempt
at
geniality
his
teeth
would
settle
hard
down
on
his
cigar
and
he
would
pass
his
spell
below
staring
and
blinking
at
the
cabin
lamp
through
a
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
he
has
told
me
since
that
he
was
happy
which
i
should
never
have
divined
see
he
said
wind
we
had
was
never
anything
out
of
the
way
but
the
sea
was
really
nasty
the
schooner
wanted
a
lot
of
humouring
and
it
was
clear
from
the
glass
that
we
were
close
to
some
dirt
we
might
be
running
out
of
it
or
we
might
be
running
right
crack
into
it
well
there
always
something
sublime
about
a
big
deal
like
that
and
it
kind
of
raises
a
man
in
his
own
liking
we
a
queer
kind
of
beasts
the
morning
broke
with
sinister
brightness
the
air
alarmingly
transparent
the
sky
pure
the
rim
of
the
horizon
clear
and
strong
against
the
heavens
the
wind
and
the
wild
seas
now
vastly
swollen
indefatigably
hunted
us
i
stood
on
deck
choking
with
fear
i
seemed
to
lose
all
power
upon
my
limbs
my
knees
were
as
paper
when
she
plunged
into
the
murderous
valleys
my
heart
collapsed
when
some
black
mountain
fell
in
avalanche
beside
her
counter
and
the
water
that
was
more
than
spray
swept
round
my
ankles
like
a
torrent
i
was
conscious
of
but
one
strong
desire
to
bear
myself
decently
in
my
terrors
and
whatever
should
happen
to
my
life
preserve
my
character
as
the
captain
said
we
are
a
queer
kind
of
beasts
breakfast
time
came
and
i
made
shift
to
swallow
some
hot
tea
then
i
must
stagger
below
to
take
the
time
reading
the
chronometer
with
dizzy
eyes
and
marvelling
the
while
what
value
there
could
be
in
observations
taken
in
a
ship
launched
as
ours
then
was
like
a
missile
among
flying
seas
the
forenoon
dragged
on
in
a
grinding
monotony
of
peril
every
spoke
of
the
wheel
a
rash
but
an
obliged
experiment
rash
as
a
forlorn
hope
needful
as
the
leap
that
lands
a
fireman
from
a
burning
staircase
noon
was
made
the
captain
dined
on
his
day
work
and
i
on
watching
him
and
our
place
was
entered
on
the
chart
with
a
meticulous
precision
which
seemed
to
me
half
pitiful
and
half
absurd
since
the
next
eye
to
behold
that
sheet
of
paper
might
be
the
eye
of
an
exploring
fish
one
came
then
two
the
captain
gloomed
and
chafed
as
he
held
to
the
coaming
of
the
house
and
if
ever
i
saw
dormant
murder
in
man
eye
it
was
in
his
god
help
the
hand
that
should
have
disobeyed
him
of
a
sudden
he
turned
towards
the
mate
who
was
doing
his
trick
at
the
wheel
points
on
the
port
bow
i
heard
him
say
and
he
took
the
wheel
himself
johnson
nodded
wiped
his
eyes
with
the
back
of
his
wet
hand
watched
a
chance
as
the
vessel
lunged
up
hill
and
got
to
the
main
rigging
where
he
swarmed
aloft
up
and
up
i
watched
him
go
hanging
on
at
every
ugly
plunge
gaining
with
every
lull
of
the
schooner
movement
until
clambering
into
the
and
clinging
with
one
arm
around
the
masts
i
could
see
him
take
one
comprehensive
sweep
of
the
southwesterly
horizon
the
next
moment
he
had
slid
down
the
backstay
and
stood
on
deck
with
a
grin
a
nod
and
a
gesture
of
the
finger
that
said
the
next
again
and
he
was
back
sweating
and
squirming
at
the
wheel
his
tired
face
streaming
and
smiling
and
his
hair
and
the
rags
and
corners
of
his
clothes
lashing
round
him
in
the
wind
nares
went
below
fetched
up
his
binocular
and
fell
into
a
silent
perusal
of
the
i
also
with
my
unaided
eyesight
little
by
little
in
that
white
waste
of
water
i
began
to
make
out
a
quarter
where
the
whiteness
appeared
more
condensed
the
sky
above
was
whitish
likewise
and
misty
like
a
squall
and
little
by
little
there
thrilled
upon
my
ears
a
note
deeper
and
more
terrible
than
the
yelling
of
the
gale
the
long
thundering
roll
of
breakers
nares
wiped
his
night
glass
on
his
sleeve
and
passed
it
to
me
motioning
as
he
did
so
with
his
hand
an
endless
wilderness
of
raging
billows
came
and
went
and
danced
in
the
circle
of
the
glass
now
and
then
a
pale
corner
of
sky
or
the
strong
line
of
the
horizon
rugged
with
the
heads
of
waves
and
then
of
a
sudden
come
and
gone
ere
i
could
fix
it
with
a
swiftness
one
glimpse
of
what
we
had
come
so
far
and
paid
so
dear
to
see
the
masts
and
rigging
of
a
brig
pencilled
on
heaven
with
an
ensign
streaming
at
the
main
and
the
ragged
ribbons
of
a
topsail
thrashing
from
the
yard
again
and
again
with
toilful
searching
i
recalled
that
apparition
there
was
no
sign
of
any
land
the
wreck
stood
between
sea
and
sky
a
thing
the
most
isolated
i
had
ever
viewed
but
as
we
drew
nearer
i
perceived
her
to
be
defended
by
a
line
of
breakers
which
drew
off
on
either
hand
and
marked
indeed
the
nearest
segment
of
the
reef
heavy
spray
hung
over
them
like
a
smoke
some
hundred
feet
into
the
air
and
the
sound
of
their
consecutive
explosions
rolled
like
a
cannonade
in
half
an
hour
we
were
close
in
for
perhaps
as
long
again
we
skirted
that
formidable
barrier
toward
its
farther
side
and
presently
the
sea
began
insensibly
to
moderate
and
the
ship
to
go
more
sweetly
we
had
gained
the
lee
of
the
island
as
for
form
sake
i
may
call
that
ring
of
foam
and
haze
and
thunder
and
shaking
out
a
reef
wore
ship
and
headed
for
the
passage
chapter
xiii
the
island
and
the
wreck
all
hands
were
filled
with
joy
it
was
betrayed
in
their
alacrity
and
easy
faces
johnson
smiling
broadly
at
the
wheel
nares
studying
the
sketch
chart
of
the
island
with
an
eye
at
peace
and
the
hands
clustered
forward
eagerly
talking
and
pointing
so
manifest
was
our
escape
so
wonderful
the
attraction
of
a
single
foot
of
earth
after
so
many
suns
had
set
and
risen
on
an
empty
sea
to
add
to
the
relief
besides
by
one
of
those
malicious
coincidences
which
suggest
for
fate
the
image
of
an
underbred
and
grinning
schoolboy
we
had
no
sooner
worn
ship
than
the
wind
began
to
abate
for
myself
however
i
did
but
exchange
anxieties
i
was
no
sooner
out
of
one
fear
than
i
fell
upon
another
no
sooner
secure
that
i
should
myself
make
the
intended
haven
than
i
began
to
be
convinced
that
trent
was
there
before
me
i
climbed
into
the
rigging
stood
on
the
board
and
eagerly
scanned
that
ring
of
coral
reef
and
bursting
breaker
and
the
blue
lagoon
which
they
enclosed
the
two
islets
within
began
to
show
plainly
middle
brooks
and
lower
brooks
island
the
directory
named
them
two
low
rolling
strips
of
sand
each
with
glittering
beaches
each
perhaps
a
mile
or
a
mile
and
a
half
in
length
running
east
and
west
and
divided
by
a
narrow
channel
over
these
innumerable
as
maggots
there
hovered
chattered
screamed
and
clanged
millions
of
twinkling
white
and
black
the
black
by
far
the
largest
with
singular
scintillations
this
vortex
of
winged
life
swayed
to
and
fro
in
the
strong
sunshine
whirled
continually
through
itself
and
would
now
and
again
burst
asunder
and
scatter
as
wide
as
the
lagoon
so
that
i
was
irresistibly
reminded
of
what
i
had
read
of
nebular
convulsions
a
thin
cloud
overspread
the
area
of
the
reef
and
the
adjacent
sea
the
dust
as
i
could
not
but
fancy
of
earlier
explosions
and
a
little
apart
there
was
yet
another
focus
of
centrifugal
and
centripetal
flight
where
hard
by
the
deafening
line
of
breakers
her
sails
all
but
the
tattered
topsail
snugly
furled
down
and
the
red
rag
that
marks
old
england
on
the
seas
beating
union
down
at
the
main
the
flying
scud
the
fruit
of
so
many
toilers
a
recollection
in
so
many
lives
of
men
whose
tall
spars
had
been
mirrored
in
the
remotest
corners
of
the
sea
lay
stationary
at
last
and
forever
in
the
first
stage
of
naval
dissolution
towards
her
the
taut
norah
creina
wriggled
to
windward
come
from
so
far
to
pick
her
bones
and
look
as
i
pleased
there
was
no
other
presence
of
man
or
of
man
handiwork
no
honolulu
schooner
lay
there
crowded
with
armed
rivals
no
smoke
rose
from
the
fire
at
which
i
fancied
trent
cooking
a
meal
of
it
seemed
after
all
we
were
in
time
and
i
drew
a
mighty
breath
i
had
not
arrived
at
this
reviving
certainty
before
the
breakers
were
already
close
aboard
the
leadsman
at
his
station
and
the
captain
posted
in
the
fore
to
con
us
through
the
coral
lumps
of
the
lagoon
all
circumstances
were
in
our
favour
the
light
behind
the
sun
low
the
wind
still
fresh
and
steady
and
the
tide
about
the
turn
a
moment
later
we
shot
at
racing
speed
betwixt
two
pier
heads
of
broken
water
the
lead
began
to
be
cast
the
captain
to
bawl
down
his
anxious
directions
the
schooner
to
tack
and
dodge
among
the
scattered
dangers
of
the
lagoon
and
at
one
bell
in
the
first
dog
watch
we
had
come
to
our
anchor
off
the
end
of
middle
brooks
island
in
five
fathoms
water
the
sails
were
gasketted
and
covered
the
boats
emptied
of
the
miscellaneous
stores
and
odds
and
ends
of
that
accumulate
in
the
course
of
a
voyage
the
kedge
sent
ashore
and
the
decks
tidied
down
a
good
of
an
hour
work
during
which
i
raged
about
the
deck
like
a
man
with
a
strong
toothache
the
transition
from
the
wild
sea
to
the
comparative
immobility
of
the
lagoon
had
wrought
strange
distress
among
my
nerves
i
could
not
hold
still
whether
in
hand
or
foot
the
slowness
of
the
men
tired
as
dogs
after
our
rough
experience
outside
irritated
me
like
something
personal
and
the
irrational
screaming
of
the
saddened
me
like
a
dirge
it
was
a
relief
when
with
nares
and
a
couple
of
hands
i
might
drop
into
the
boat
and
move
off
at
last
for
the
flying
scud
looks
kind
of
pitiful
do
she
observed
the
captain
nodding
towards
the
wreck
from
which
we
were
separated
by
some
half
a
mile
as
if
she
did
like
her
berth
and
captain
trent
had
used
her
badly
give
her
ginger
boys
he
added
to
the
hands
you
can
all
have
shore
liberty
to
see
the
birds
and
paint
the
town
we
all
laughed
at
the
pleasantry
and
the
boat
skimmed
the
faster
over
the
rippling
face
of
the
lagoon
the
flying
scud
would
have
seemed
small
enough
beside
the
wharves
of
san
francisco
but
she
was
some
thrice
the
size
of
the
norah
creina
which
had
been
so
long
our
continent
and
as
we
craned
up
at
her
she
impressed
us
with
a
mountain
magnitude
she
lay
head
to
the
reef
where
the
huge
blue
wall
of
the
rollers
was
for
ever
ranging
up
and
crumbling
down
and
to
gain
her
starboard
side
we
must
pass
below
the
stern
the
rudder
was
hard
aport
and
we
could
read
the
legend
flying
scud
hull
on
the
other
side
about
the
break
of
the
poop
some
half
a
fathom
of
rope
ladder
trailed
over
the
rail
and
by
this
we
made
our
entrance
she
was
a
roomy
ship
inside
with
a
raised
poop
standing
some
three
feet
higher
than
the
deck
and
a
small
forward
house
for
the
men
bunks
and
the
galley
just
abaft
the
foremast
there
was
one
boat
on
the
house
and
another
and
larger
one
in
beds
on
deck
on
either
hand
of
it
she
had
been
painted
white
with
tropical
economy
outside
and
in
and
we
found
later
on
that
the
stanchions
of
the
rail
hoops
of
the
scuttle
but
were
picked
out
with
green
at
that
time
however
when
we
first
stepped
aboard
all
was
hidden
under
the
droppings
of
innumerable
the
birds
themselves
gyrated
and
screamed
meanwhile
among
the
rigging
and
when
we
looked
into
the
galley
their
outrush
drove
us
back
fowl
they
were
savagely
beaked
and
some
of
the
black
ones
great
as
eagles
in
the
slush
we
were
aware
of
a
litter
of
kegs
in
the
waist
and
these
on
being
somewhat
cleaned
proved
to
be
water
beakers
and
quarter
casks
of
mess
beef
with
some
colonial
brand
doubtless
collected
there
before
the
tempest
hove
in
sight
and
while
trent
and
his
men
had
no
better
expectation
than
to
strike
for
honolulu
in
the
boats
nothing
else
was
notable
on
deck
save
where
the
loose
topsail
had
played
some
havoc
with
the
rigging
and
there
hung
and
swayed
and
sang
in
the
declining
wind
a
raffle
of
intorted
cordage
with
a
shyness
that
was
almost
awe
nares
and
i
descended
the
companion
the
stair
turned
upon
itself
and
landed
us
just
forward
of
a
bulkhead
that
cut
the
poop
in
two
the
fore
part
formed
a
kind
of
miscellaneous
with
a
division
for
the
cook
as
nares
supposed
and
second
mate
the
after
part
contained
in
the
midst
the
main
cabin
running
in
a
kind
of
bow
into
the
curvature
of
the
stern
on
the
port
side
a
pantry
opening
forward
and
a
stateroom
for
the
mate
and
on
the
starboard
the
captain
berth
and
into
these
we
did
but
glance
the
main
cabin
holding
us
it
was
dark
for
the
had
obscured
the
skylight
with
their
droppings
it
smelt
rank
and
fusty
and
it
was
beset
with
a
loud
swarm
of
flies
that
beat
continually
in
our
faces
supposing
them
close
attendants
upon
man
and
his
broken
meat
i
marvelled
how
they
had
found
their
way
to
midway
reef
it
was
sure
at
least
some
vessel
must
have
brought
them
and
that
long
ago
for
they
had
multiplied
exceedingly
part
of
the
floor
was
strewn
with
a
confusion
of
clothes
books
nautical
instruments
odds
and
ends
of
finery
and
such
trash
as
might
be
expected
from
the
turning
out
of
several
seamen
chests
upon
a
sudden
emergency
and
after
a
long
cruise
it
was
strange
in
that
dim
cabin
quivering
with
the
near
thunder
of
the
breakers
and
pierced
with
the
screaming
of
the
fowls
to
turn
over
so
many
things
that
other
men
had
coveted
and
prized
and
worn
on
their
warm
bodies
frayed
old
underclothing
pyjamas
of
strange
design
duck
suits
in
every
stage
of
rustiness
oil
skins
pilot
coats
bottles
of
scent
embroidered
shirts
jackets
of
ponjee
silk
clothes
for
the
night
watch
at
sea
or
the
day
ashore
in
the
hotel
verandah
and
mingled
among
these
books
cigars
fancy
pipes
quantities
of
tobacco
many
keys
a
rusty
pistol
and
a
sprinkling
of
cheap
curiosities
benares
brass
chinese
jars
and
pictures
and
bottles
of
odd
shells
in
cotton
each
designed
no
doubt
for
somebody
at
home
perhaps
in
hull
of
which
trent
had
been
a
native
and
his
ship
a
citizen
thence
we
turned
our
attention
to
the
table
which
stood
spread
as
if
for
a
meal
with
stout
ship
crockery
and
the
remains
of
food
a
pot
of
marmalade
dregs
of
coffee
in
the
mugs
unrecognisable
remains
of
foods
bread
some
toast
and
a
tin
of
condensed
milk
the
originally
of
a
red
colour
was
stained
a
dark
brown
at
the
end
apparently
with
coffee
at
the
other
end
it
had
been
folded
back
and
a
pen
and
stood
on
the
bare
table
stools
were
here
and
there
about
the
table
irregularly
placed
as
though
the
meal
had
been
finished
and
the
men
smoking
and
chatting
and
one
of
the
stools
lay
on
the
floor
broken
they
were
writing
up
the
log
said
nares
pointing
to
the
napping
as
usual
i
wonder
if
there
ever
was
a
captain
yet
that
lost
a
ship
with
his
up
to
date
he
generally
has
about
a
month
to
fill
up
on
a
clean
break
like
charles
dickens
and
his
serial
what
a
regular
spread
he
added
contemptuously
and
toast
for
the
old
man
nasty
slovenly
pigs
there
was
something
in
this
criticism
of
the
absent
that
jarred
upon
my
feelings
i
had
no
love
indeed
for
captain
trent
or
any
of
his
vanished
gang
but
the
desertion
and
decay
of
this
once
habitable
cabin
struck
me
hard
the
death
of
man
handiwork
is
melancholy
like
the
death
of
man
himself
and
i
was
impressed
with
an
involuntary
and
irrational
sense
of
tragedy
in
my
surroundings
sickens
me
i
said
go
on
deck
and
the
captain
nodded
is
kind
of
lonely
is
it
he
said
i
ca
go
up
till
i
get
the
code
signals
i
want
to
run
up
left
or
something
just
to
brighten
up
this
island
home
captain
trent
been
here
yet
but
he
drop
in
before
long
and
it
cheer
him
up
to
see
a
signal
on
the
there
some
official
expression
we
could
use
i
asked
vastly
taken
by
the
fancy
for
the
benefit
of
the
underwriters
for
further
particulars
apply
to
pinkerton
montana
block
returned
nares
wo
say
but
what
an
old
navy
quartermaster
might
telegraph
all
that
if
you
gave
him
a
day
to
do
it
in
and
a
pound
of
tobacco
for
himself
but
it
above
my
register
i
must
try
something
short
and
sweet
kb
urgent
signal
all
aback
or
lm
urgent
berth
you
now
in
is
not
safe
or
what
do
you
say
to
pqh
my
owners
the
ship
answers
remarkably
well
premature
i
replied
it
seems
calculated
to
give
pain
to
trent
pqh
for
the
flags
were
found
in
trent
cabin
neatly
stored
behind
a
lettered
grating
nares
chose
what
he
required
and
i
following
returned
on
deck
where
the
sun
had
already
dipped
and
the
dusk
was
coming
do
touch
that
you
fool
shouted
the
captain
to
one
of
the
hands
who
was
drinking
from
the
scuttle
but
water
rotten
pardon
sir
replied
the
man
quite
me
see
returned
nares
and
he
took
the
dipper
and
held
it
to
his
lips
it
all
right
he
said
have
rotted
and
come
sweet
again
queer
is
it
dodd
though
i
known
the
same
on
a
cape
there
was
something
in
his
intonation
that
made
me
look
him
in
the
face
he
stood
a
little
on
tiptoe
to
look
right
and
left
about
the
ship
like
a
man
filled
with
curiosity
and
his
whole
expression
and
bearing
testified
to
some
suppressed
excitement
do
believe
what
you
saying
i
broke
out
i
do
know
but
what
i
do
he
replied
laying
a
hand
upon
me
soothingly
thing
very
possible
only
i
bothered
about
something
and
with
that
he
called
a
hand
gave
him
the
code
flags
and
stepped
himself
to
the
main
signal
halliards
which
vibrated
under
the
weight
of
the
ensign
overhead
a
minute
later
the
american
colours
which
we
had
brought
in
the
boat
replaced
the
english
red
and
pqh
was
fluttering
at
the
fore
then
said
nares
who
had
watched
the
breaking
out
of
his
signal
with
the
particularity
of
an
american
sailor
with
those
handspikes
and
let
see
what
water
there
is
in
the
the
bars
were
shoved
home
the
barbarous
cacophony
of
the
clanking
pump
rose
in
the
waist
and
streams
of
water
gushed
on
deck
and
made
valleys
in
the
slab
guano
nares
leaned
on
the
rail
watching
the
steady
stream
of
bilge
as
though
he
found
some
interest
in
it
is
it
that
bothers
you
i
asked
i
tell
you
one
thing
shortly
he
replied
another
do
you
see
those
boats
there
one
on
the
house
and
two
on
the
beds
well
where
is
the
boat
trent
lowered
when
he
lost
the
hands
it
aboard
again
i
suppose
said
i
if
you
tell
me
why
returned
the
captain
it
must
have
been
another
i
suggested
might
have
carried
another
on
the
main
hatch
i
wo
deny
admitted
nares
i
ca
see
what
she
wanted
with
it
unless
it
was
for
the
old
man
to
go
out
and
play
the
accordion
in
on
moonlight
ca
much
matter
anyway
i
reflected
i
do
suppose
it
does
said
he
glancing
over
his
shoulder
at
the
spouting
of
the
scuppers
how
long
are
we
to
keep
up
this
racket
i
asked
simply
pumping
up
the
lagoon
captain
trent
himself
said
she
had
settled
down
and
was
full
he
said
nares
with
a
significant
dryness
and
almost
as
he
spoke
the
pumps
sucked
and
sucked
again
and
the
men
threw
down
their
bars
what
do
you
make
of
that
he
asked
i
tell
dodd
he
went
on
lowering
his
voice
but
not
shifting
from
his
easy
attitude
against
the
rail
ship
is
as
sound
as
the
norah
creina
i
had
a
guess
of
it
before
we
came
aboard
and
now
i
not
possible
i
cried
do
you
make
of
trent
do
make
anything
of
trent
i
do
know
whether
he
a
liar
or
only
an
old
wife
i
simply
tell
you
what
the
fact
said
nares
i
tell
you
something
more
he
added
taken
the
ground
myself
in
vessels
i
know
what
i
saying
and
i
say
that
when
she
first
struck
and
before
she
bedded
down
seven
or
eight
hours
work
would
have
got
this
hooker
off
and
there
no
man
that
ever
went
two
years
to
sea
but
must
have
known
i
could
only
utter
an
exclamation
nares
raised
his
finger
warningly
let
them
get
hold
of
it
said
he
what
you
like
but
say
i
glanced
round
the
dusk
was
melting
into
early
night
the
twinkle
of
a
lantern
marked
the
schooner
position
in
the
distance
and
our
men
free
from
further
labour
stood
grouped
together
in
the
waist
their
faces
illuminated
by
their
glowing
pipes
did
trent
get
her
off
inquired
the
captain
did
he
want
to
buy
her
back
in
for
these
fabulous
sums
when
he
might
have
sailed
her
into
the
bay
himself
he
never
knew
her
value
until
then
i
suggested
wish
we
knew
her
value
now
exclaimed
nares
i
do
want
to
depress
you
i
sorry
for
you
dodd
i
know
how
bothering
it
must
be
to
you
and
the
best
i
can
say
this
i
have
taken
much
time
getting
down
and
now
i
here
i
mean
to
work
this
thing
in
proper
style
i
just
want
to
put
your
mind
at
rest
you
shall
have
no
trouble
with
there
was
something
trusty
and
friendly
in
his
voice
and
i
found
myself
gripping
hands
with
him
in
that
hard
short
shake
that
means
so
much
with
people
do
old
fellow
said
he
shaken
down
into
pretty
good
friends
you
and
me
and
you
wo
find
me
working
the
business
any
the
less
hard
for
that
and
now
let
scoot
for
after
supper
with
the
idle
curiosity
of
the
seafarer
we
pulled
ashore
in
a
fine
moonlight
and
landed
on
middle
brook
island
a
flat
beach
surrounded
it
upon
all
sides
and
the
midst
was
occupied
by
a
thicket
of
bushes
the
highest
of
them
scarcely
five
feet
high
in
which
the
lived
through
this
we
tried
at
first
to
strike
but
it
were
easier
to
cross
trafalgar
square
on
a
day
of
demonstration
than
to
invade
these
haunts
of
sleeping
the
nests
sank
and
the
eggs
burst
under
footing
wings
beat
in
our
faces
beaks
menaced
our
eyes
our
minds
were
confounded
with
the
screeching
and
the
coil
spread
over
the
island
and
mounted
high
into
the
air
guess
we
saunter
round
the
beach
said
nares
when
we
had
made
good
our
retreat
the
hands
were
all
busy
after
eggs
so
there
were
none
to
follow
us
our
way
lay
on
the
crisp
sand
by
the
margin
of
the
water
on
one
side
the
thicket
from
which
we
had
been
dislodged
on
the
other
the
face
of
the
lagoon
barred
with
a
broad
path
of
moonlight
and
beyond
that
the
line
alternately
dark
and
shining
alternately
hove
high
and
fallen
prone
of
the
external
breakers
the
beach
was
strewn
with
bits
of
wreck
and
drift
some
redwood
and
spruce
logs
no
less
than
two
lower
masts
of
junks
and
the
of
a
european
ship
all
of
which
we
looked
on
with
a
shade
of
serious
concern
speaking
of
the
dangers
of
the
sea
and
the
hard
case
of
castaways
in
this
sober
vein
we
made
the
greater
part
of
the
circuit
of
the
island
had
a
near
view
of
its
neighbour
from
the
southern
end
walked
the
whole
length
of
the
westerly
side
in
the
shadow
of
the
thicket
and
came
forth
again
into
the
moonlight
at
the
opposite
extremity
on
our
right
at
the
distance
of
about
half
a
mile
the
schooner
lay
faintly
heaving
at
her
anchors
about
half
a
mile
down
the
beach
at
a
spot
still
hidden
from
us
by
the
thicket
an
upboiling
of
the
birds
showed
where
the
men
were
still
with
insatiability
collecting
eggs
and
right
before
us
in
a
small
indentation
of
the
sand
we
were
aware
of
a
boat
lying
high
and
dry
and
right
side
up
nares
crouched
back
into
the
shadow
of
the
bushes
the
devil
this
he
whispered
i
suggested
with
a
beating
heart
were
damned
fools
to
come
ashore
unarmed
said
he
i
got
to
know
where
i
in
the
shadow
his
face
looked
conspicuously
white
and
his
voice
betrayed
a
strong
excitement
he
took
his
boat
whistle
from
his
pocket
case
i
might
want
to
play
a
tune
said
he
grimly
and
thrusting
it
between
his
teeth
advanced
into
the
moonlit
open
which
we
crossed
with
rapid
steps
looking
guiltily
about
us
as
we
went
not
a
leaf
stirred
and
the
boat
when
we
came
up
to
it
offered
convincing
proof
of
long
desertion
she
was
an
whaleboat
of
the
ordinary
type
equipped
with
oars
and
two
or
three
lay
on
the
bilge
amidships
one
of
which
must
have
been
broached
and
now
stank
horribly
and
these
upon
examination
proved
to
bear
the
same
new
zealand
brand
as
the
beef
on
board
the
wreck
here
the
boat
said
i
one
of
your
difficulties
cleared
said
he
there
was
a
little
water
in
the
bilge
and
here
he
stooped
and
tasted
it
he
said
do
object
to
that
i
asked
said
he
then
what
ails
you
i
cried
plain
united
states
dodd
he
returned
whaleboat
five
ash
sweeps
and
a
barrel
of
stinking
in
other
words
the
whole
thing
i
commented
it
this
way
he
condescended
to
explain
no
use
for
a
fourth
boat
at
all
but
a
boat
of
this
model
tops
the
business
i
say
the
type
not
common
in
these
waters
it
as
common
as
dirt
the
traders
carry
them
for
but
the
flying
scud
a
tramp
who
was
around
between
big
ports
calcutta
and
rangoon
and
and
the
canton
river
no
i
do
see
we
were
leaning
over
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
as
we
spoke
the
captain
stood
nearest
the
bow
and
he
was
idly
playing
with
the
trailing
painter
when
a
thought
arrested
him
he
hauled
the
line
in
hand
over
hand
and
stared
and
remained
staring
at
the
end
wrong
with
it
i
asked
you
know
dodd
said
he
in
a
queer
voice
painter
been
cut
a
sailor
always
seizes
a
rope
end
but
this
is
sliced
short
off
with
the
cold
steel
this
wo
do
at
all
for
the
men
he
added
stand
by
till
i
fix
it
up
more
guess
what
it
all
means
i
asked
it
means
one
thing
said
he
means
trent
was
a
liar
i
guess
the
story
of
the
flying
scud
was
a
sight
more
picturesque
than
he
gave
half
an
hour
later
the
whaleboat
was
lying
astern
of
the
norah
creina
and
nares
and
i
sought
our
bunks
silent
and
by
our
late
discoveries
chapter
xiv
the
cabin
of
the
the
sun
of
the
morrow
had
not
cleared
the
morning
bank
the
lake
of
the
lagoon
the
islets
and
the
wall
of
breakers
now
beginning
to
subside
still
lay
clearly
pictured
in
the
flushed
obscurity
of
early
day
when
we
stepped
again
upon
the
deck
of
the
flying
scud
nares
myself
the
mate
two
of
the
hands
and
one
dozen
bright
virgin
axes
in
war
against
that
massive
structure
i
think
we
all
drew
pleasurable
breath
so
profound
in
man
is
the
instinct
of
destruction
so
engaging
is
the
interest
of
the
chase
for
we
were
now
about
to
taste
in
a
supreme
degree
the
double
joys
of
demolishing
a
toy
and
playing
the
sports
from
which
we
had
all
perhaps
desisted
since
the
days
of
infancy
and
the
toy
we
were
to
burst
in
pieces
was
a
ship
and
the
hidden
good
for
which
we
were
to
hunt
was
a
prodigious
fortune
the
decks
were
washed
down
the
main
hatch
removed
and
a
purchase
rigged
before
the
boat
arrived
with
breakfast
i
had
grown
so
suspicious
of
the
wreck
that
it
was
a
positive
relief
to
me
to
look
down
into
the
hold
and
see
it
full
or
nearly
full
of
undeniable
rice
packed
in
the
chinese
fashion
in
boluses
of
matting
breakfast
over
johnson
and
the
hands
turned
to
upon
the
cargo
while
nares
and
i
having
smashed
open
the
skylight
and
rigged
up
a
windsail
on
deck
began
the
work
of
rummaging
the
cabins
i
must
not
be
expected
to
describe
our
first
day
work
or
for
that
matter
any
of
the
rest
in
order
and
detail
as
it
occurred
such
particularity
might
have
been
possible
for
several
officers
and
a
draft
of
men
from
a
ship
of
war
accompanied
by
an
experienced
secretary
with
a
knowledge
of
shorthand
for
two
plain
human
beings
unaccustomed
to
the
use
of
the
and
consumed
with
an
impatient
greed
of
the
result
the
whole
business
melts
in
the
retrospect
into
a
nightmare
of
exertion
heat
hurry
and
bewilderment
sweat
pouring
from
the
face
like
rain
the
scurry
of
rats
the
choking
exhalations
of
the
bilge
and
the
throbs
and
splinterings
of
the
toiling
axes
i
shall
content
myself
with
giving
the
cream
of
our
discoveries
in
a
logical
rather
than
a
temporal
order
though
the
two
indeed
practically
coincided
and
we
had
finished
our
exploration
of
the
cabin
before
we
could
be
certain
of
the
nature
of
the
cargo
nares
and
i
began
operations
by
tossing
up
through
the
companion
and
piling
in
a
squalid
heap
about
the
wheel
all
clothes
personal
effects
the
crockery
the
carpet
stale
victuals
tins
of
meat
and
in
a
word
all
movables
from
the
main
cabin
thence
we
transferred
our
attention
to
the
captain
quarters
on
the
starboard
side
using
the
blankets
for
a
basket
we
sent
up
the
books
instruments
and
clothes
to
swell
our
growing
midden
on
the
deck
and
then
nares
going
on
hands
and
knees
began
to
forage
underneath
the
bed
box
after
box
of
manilla
cigars
rewarded
his
search
i
took
occasion
to
smash
some
of
these
boxes
open
and
even
to
guillotine
the
bundles
of
cigars
but
quite
in
vain
no
secret
cache
of
opium
encouraged
me
to
continue
guess
i
got
hold
of
the
dicky
now
exclaimed
nares
and
turning
round
from
my
perquisitions
i
found
he
had
drawn
forth
a
heavy
iron
box
secured
to
the
bulkhead
by
chain
and
padlock
on
this
he
was
now
gazing
not
with
the
triumph
that
instantly
inflamed
my
own
bosom
but
with
a
somewhat
foolish
appearance
of
surprise
george
we
have
it
now
i
cried
and
would
have
shaken
hands
with
my
companion
but
he
did
not
see
or
would
not
accept
the
salutation
see
what
in
it
first
he
remarked
dryly
and
he
adjusted
the
box
upon
its
side
and
with
some
blows
of
an
axe
burst
the
lock
open
i
threw
myself
beside
him
as
he
replaced
the
box
on
its
bottom
and
removed
the
lid
i
can
not
tell
what
i
expected
a
million
worth
of
diamonds
might
perhaps
have
pleased
me
my
cheeks
burned
my
heart
throbbed
to
bursting
and
lo
there
was
disclosed
but
a
trayful
of
papers
neatly
taped
and
a
of
the
customary
pattern
i
made
a
snatch
at
the
tray
to
see
what
was
beneath
but
the
captain
hand
fell
on
mine
heavy
and
hard
boss
he
cried
not
unkindly
this
to
be
run
shipshape
or
is
it
a
dutch
and
he
proceeded
to
untie
and
run
over
the
contents
of
the
papers
with
a
serious
face
and
what
seemed
an
ostentation
of
delay
me
and
my
impatience
it
would
appear
he
had
forgotten
for
when
he
was
quite
done
he
sat
a
while
thinking
whistled
a
bar
or
two
refolded
the
papers
tied
them
up
again
and
then
and
not
before
deliberately
raised
the
tray
i
saw
a
tied
with
a
piece
of
and
four
fat
nares
whipped
out
his
knife
cut
the
line
and
opened
the
box
it
was
about
half
full
of
sovereigns
the
bags
i
whispered
the
captain
ripped
them
open
one
by
one
and
a
flood
of
mixed
silver
coin
burst
forth
and
rattled
in
the
rusty
bottom
of
the
box
without
a
word
he
set
to
work
to
count
the
gold
is
this
i
asked
the
ship
money
he
returned
doggedly
continuing
his
work
ship
money
i
repeated
the
money
trent
tramped
and
traded
with
and
there
his
to
draw
upon
his
owners
and
he
has
left
it
guess
he
has
said
nares
austerely
jotting
down
a
note
of
the
gold
and
i
was
abashed
into
silence
till
his
task
should
be
completed
it
came
i
think
to
three
hundred
and
pounds
sterling
some
nineteen
pounds
of
it
in
silver
all
of
which
we
turned
again
into
the
chest
what
do
you
think
of
that
i
asked
dodd
he
replied
see
something
of
the
rumness
of
this
job
but
not
the
whole
the
specie
bothers
you
but
what
gets
me
is
the
papers
are
you
aware
that
the
master
of
a
ship
has
charge
of
all
the
cash
in
hand
pays
the
men
advances
receives
freight
and
passage
money
and
runs
up
bills
in
every
port
all
this
he
does
as
the
confidential
agent
and
his
integrity
is
proved
by
his
receipted
bills
i
tell
you
the
captain
of
a
ship
is
more
likely
to
forget
his
pants
than
these
bills
which
guarantee
his
character
i
known
men
drown
to
save
them
bad
men
too
but
this
is
the
shipmaster
honour
and
here
this
captain
trent
not
hurried
not
threatened
with
anything
but
a
free
passage
in
a
british
has
left
them
all
behind
i
do
want
to
express
myself
too
strongly
because
the
facts
appear
against
me
but
the
thing
is
dinner
came
to
us
not
long
after
and
we
ate
it
on
deck
in
a
grim
silence
each
privately
racking
his
brain
for
some
solution
of
the
mysteries
i
was
indeed
so
swallowed
up
in
these
considerations
that
the
wreck
the
lagoon
the
islets
and
the
strident
the
strong
sun
then
beating
on
my
head
and
even
the
gloomy
countenance
of
the
captain
at
my
elbow
all
vanished
from
the
field
of
consciousness
my
mind
was
a
blackboard
on
which
i
scrawled
and
blotted
out
hypotheses
comparing
each
with
the
pictorial
records
in
my
memory
cyphering
with
pictures
in
the
course
of
this
tense
mental
exercise
i
recalled
and
studied
the
faces
of
one
memorial
masterpiece
the
scene
of
the
saloon
and
here
i
found
myself
on
a
sudden
looking
in
the
eyes
of
the
kanaka
one
thing
i
can
put
beyond
doubt
at
all
events
i
cried
relinquishing
my
dinner
and
getting
briskly
afoot
was
that
kanaka
i
saw
in
the
bar
with
captain
trent
the
fellow
the
newspapers
and
ship
articles
made
out
to
be
a
chinaman
i
mean
to
rout
his
quarters
out
and
settle
right
said
nares
lazy
off
a
bit
longer
dodd
i
feel
pretty
rocky
and
we
had
thoroughly
cleared
out
the
three
of
the
ship
all
the
stuff
from
the
main
cabin
and
the
mate
and
captain
quarters
lay
piled
about
the
wheel
but
in
the
forward
stateroom
with
the
two
bunks
where
nares
had
said
the
mate
and
cook
most
likely
berthed
we
had
as
yet
done
nothing
thither
i
went
it
was
very
bare
a
few
photographs
were
tacked
on
the
bulkhead
one
of
them
indecent
a
single
chest
stood
open
and
like
all
we
had
yet
found
it
had
been
partly
rifled
an
armful
of
novels
proved
to
me
beyond
a
doubt
it
was
a
european
no
chinaman
would
have
possessed
any
and
the
most
literate
kanaka
conceivable
in
a
ship
galley
was
not
likely
to
have
gone
beyond
one
it
was
plain
then
that
the
cook
had
not
berthed
aft
and
i
must
look
elsewhere
the
men
had
stamped
down
the
nests
and
driven
the
birds
from
the
galley
so
that
i
could
now
enter
without
contest
one
door
had
been
already
blocked
with
rice
the
place
was
in
part
darkness
full
of
a
foul
stale
smell
and
a
cloud
of
nasty
flies
it
had
been
left
besides
in
some
disorder
or
else
the
birds
during
their
time
of
tenancy
had
knocked
the
things
about
and
the
floor
like
the
deck
before
we
washed
it
was
spread
with
pasty
filth
against
the
wall
in
the
far
corner
i
found
a
handsome
chest
of
bound
with
brass
such
as
chinamen
and
sailors
love
and
indeed
all
of
mankind
that
plies
in
the
pacific
from
its
outside
view
i
could
thus
make
no
deduction
and
strange
to
say
the
interior
was
concealed
all
the
other
chests
as
i
have
said
already
we
had
found
gaping
open
and
their
contents
scattered
abroad
the
same
remark
we
found
to
apply
afterwards
in
the
quarters
of
the
seamen
only
this
chest
a
singular
exception
was
both
closed
and
locked
i
took
an
axe
to
it
readily
forced
the
paltry
chinese
fastening
and
like
a
officer
plunged
my
hands
among
the
contents
for
some
while
i
groped
among
linen
and
cotton
then
my
teeth
were
set
on
edge
with
silk
of
which
i
drew
forth
several
strips
covered
with
mysterious
characters
and
these
settled
the
business
for
i
recognised
them
as
a
kind
of
popular
with
the
commoner
class
of
the
chinese
nor
were
further
evidences
wanting
such
as
of
an
extraordinary
design
a
chinese
fiddle
a
silk
handkerchief
full
of
roots
and
herbs
and
a
neat
apparatus
for
smoking
opium
with
a
liberal
provision
of
the
drug
plainly
then
the
cook
had
been
a
chinaman
and
if
so
who
was
jos
amalu
or
had
jos
stolen
the
chest
before
he
proceeded
to
ship
under
a
false
name
and
domicile
it
was
possible
as
anything
was
possible
in
such
a
welter
but
regarded
as
a
solution
it
only
led
and
left
me
deeper
in
the
bog
for
why
should
this
chest
have
been
deserted
and
neglected
when
the
others
were
rummaged
or
removed
and
where
had
jos
come
by
that
second
chest
with
which
according
to
the
clerk
at
the
what
cheer
he
had
started
for
honolulu
how
have
you
fared
inquired
the
captain
whom
i
found
luxuriously
reclining
in
our
mound
of
litter
and
the
accent
on
the
pronoun
the
heightened
colour
of
the
speaker
face
and
the
contained
excitement
in
his
tones
advertised
me
at
once
that
i
had
not
been
alone
to
make
discoveries
have
found
a
chinaman
chest
in
the
galley
said
i
john
if
there
was
any
john
was
not
so
much
as
at
the
pains
to
take
his
nares
seemed
to
take
it
mighty
quietly
so
said
he
cast
your
eyes
on
that
and
own
you
beaten
and
with
a
formidable
clap
of
his
open
hand
he
flattened
out
before
me
on
the
deck
a
pair
of
newspapers
i
gazed
upon
them
dully
being
in
no
mood
for
fresh
discoveries
at
them
dodd
cried
the
captain
sharply
you
look
at
them
and
he
ran
a
dirty
thumb
along
the
title
morning
november
ca
you
make
that
out
he
cried
with
rising
energy
do
you
know
sir
that
not
thirteen
days
after
this
paper
appeared
in
new
south
pole
this
ship
we
standing
in
heaved
her
blessed
anchors
out
of
china
how
did
the
morning
get
to
hong
kong
in
thirteen
days
trent
made
no
land
he
spoke
no
ship
till
he
got
here
then
he
either
got
it
here
or
in
hong
kong
i
give
you
your
choice
my
son
he
cried
and
fell
back
among
the
clothes
like
a
man
weary
of
life
did
you
find
them
i
asked
that
black
bag
so
he
said
need
fool
with
it
there
nothing
else
but
a
and
a
kind
of
i
looked
in
the
bag
however
and
was
well
rewarded
man
to
his
trade
captain
said
i
a
sailor
and
given
me
plenty
of
points
but
i
am
an
artist
and
allow
me
to
inform
you
this
is
quite
as
strange
as
all
the
rest
the
knife
is
a
the
pencil
a
winsor
and
newton
and
a
b
b
b
at
that
a
and
a
b
b
b
on
a
tramp
brig
it
against
the
laws
of
would
sicken
a
dog
would
it
said
nares
i
continued
been
used
by
an
artist
too
see
how
sharpened
not
for
writing
no
man
could
write
with
that
an
artist
and
straight
from
sydney
how
can
he
come
in
that
natural
enough
sneered
nares
cabled
him
to
come
up
and
illustrate
this
dime
we
fell
a
while
silent
i
said
at
last
is
something
deuced
underhand
about
this
brig
you
tell
me
you
been
to
sea
a
good
part
of
your
life
you
must
have
seen
shady
things
done
on
ships
and
heard
of
more
well
what
is
this
is
it
insurance
is
it
piracy
what
is
it
about
what
can
it
be
for
dodd
returned
nares
right
about
me
having
been
to
sea
the
bigger
part
of
my
life
and
you
right
again
when
you
think
i
know
a
good
many
ways
in
which
a
dishonest
captain
may
be
on
the
square
nor
do
exactly
the
right
thing
by
his
owners
and
altogether
be
just
a
little
too
smart
by
and
there
a
good
many
ways
but
not
so
many
as
you
think
and
not
one
that
has
any
mortal
thing
to
do
with
trent
trent
and
his
whole
racket
has
got
to
do
with
nothing
that
the
fact
there
no
sense
to
it
and
no
use
in
it
and
no
story
to
it
it
a
beastly
dream
and
do
you
run
away
with
that
notion
that
landsmen
take
about
ships
a
society
actress
go
around
more
publicly
than
what
a
ship
does
nor
is
more
interviewed
nor
more
humbugged
nor
more
run
after
by
all
sorts
of
little
fussinesses
in
brass
buttons
and
more
than
an
actress
a
ship
has
a
deal
to
lose
she
capital
and
the
actress
only
character
if
that
the
ports
of
the
world
are
thick
with
people
ready
to
kick
a
captain
into
the
penitentiary
if
he
not
as
bright
as
a
dollar
and
as
honest
as
the
morning
star
and
what
with
lloyd
keeping
watch
and
watch
in
every
corner
of
the
three
oceans
and
the
insurance
leeches
and
the
consuls
and
the
customs
bugs
and
the
medicos
you
can
only
get
the
idea
by
thinking
of
a
landsman
watched
by
a
hundred
and
fifty
detectives
or
a
stranger
in
a
village
down
but
at
sea
i
said
make
me
tired
retorted
the
captain
the
use
at
sea
everything
got
to
come
to
bearings
at
some
port
has
it
you
stop
at
sea
for
ever
can
you
no
the
flying
scud
is
rubbish
if
it
meant
anything
it
would
have
to
mean
something
so
almighty
intricate
that
james
blaine
has
got
the
brains
to
engineer
it
and
i
vote
for
more
axeing
pioneering
and
opening
up
the
resources
of
this
phenomenal
brig
and
less
general
fuss
he
added
arising
symptoms
will
drop
in
of
themselves
i
guess
to
keep
us
but
it
appeared
we
were
at
the
end
of
discoveries
for
the
day
and
we
left
the
brig
about
sundown
without
being
further
puzzled
or
further
enlightened
the
best
of
the
cabin
spoils
books
instruments
papers
silks
and
curiosities
we
carried
along
with
us
in
a
blanket
however
to
divert
the
evening
hours
and
when
supper
was
over
and
the
table
cleared
and
johnson
set
down
to
a
dreary
game
of
cribbage
between
his
right
hand
and
his
left
the
captain
and
i
turned
out
our
blanket
on
the
floor
and
sat
side
by
side
to
examine
and
appraise
the
spoils
the
books
were
the
first
to
engage
our
notice
these
were
rather
numerous
as
nares
contemptuously
put
it
a
scorn
of
the
british
mercantile
marine
glows
in
the
breast
of
every
yankee
merchant
captain
as
the
scorn
is
not
reciprocated
i
can
only
suppose
it
justified
in
fact
and
certainly
the
old
country
mariner
appears
of
a
less
studious
disposition
the
more
credit
to
the
officers
of
the
flying
scud
who
had
quite
a
library
both
literary
and
professional
there
were
findlay
five
directories
of
the
world
all
as
is
usual
with
findlay
and
all
marked
and
scribbled
over
with
corrections
and
additions
several
books
of
navigation
a
signal
code
and
an
admiralty
book
of
a
sort
of
orange
hue
called
of
the
eastern
pacific
ocean
vol
which
appeared
from
its
imprint
to
be
the
latest
authority
and
showed
marks
of
frequent
consultation
in
the
passages
about
the
french
frigate
shoals
the
harman
cure
pearl
and
hermes
reefs
lisiansky
island
ocean
island
and
the
place
where
we
then
lay
brooks
or
midway
a
volume
of
macaulay
and
a
shilling
shakespeare
led
the
van
of
the
belles
lettres
the
rest
were
novels
several
miss
braddons
of
course
which
has
penetrated
to
every
isle
of
the
pacific
a
good
many
cheap
detective
books
auerbach
der
in
the
german
and
a
prize
temperance
story
pillaged
to
judge
by
the
stamp
from
an
circulating
library
admiralty
man
gives
a
fine
picture
of
our
island
remarked
nares
who
had
turned
up
midway
island
draws
the
dreariness
rather
mild
but
you
can
make
out
he
knows
the
i
cried
struck
another
point
in
this
mad
business
see
here
i
went
on
eagerly
drawing
from
my
pocket
a
crumpled
fragment
of
the
which
i
had
inherited
from
jim
by
hoyt
pacific
directory
where
hoyt
look
into
that
said
nares
got
that
book
on
purpose
for
this
therewith
he
fetched
it
from
the
shelf
in
his
berth
turned
to
midway
island
and
read
the
account
aloud
it
stated
with
precision
that
the
pacific
mail
company
were
about
to
form
a
depot
there
in
preference
to
honolulu
and
that
they
had
already
a
station
on
the
island
wonder
who
gives
these
directory
men
their
information
nares
reflected
can
blame
trent
after
that
i
never
got
in
company
with
squarer
lying
it
reminds
a
man
of
a
presidential
very
well
said
i
your
hoyt
and
a
fine
tall
copy
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
where
is
trent
hoyt
it
with
him
chuckled
nares
had
left
everything
else
bills
and
money
and
all
the
rest
he
was
bound
to
take
something
or
it
would
have
aroused
attention
on
the
tempest
thought
says
he
take
hoyt
has
it
not
occurred
to
you
i
went
on
all
the
hoyts
in
creation
could
have
misled
trent
since
he
had
in
his
hand
that
red
admiralty
book
an
official
publication
later
in
date
and
particularly
full
on
midway
island
a
fact
cried
nares
i
bet
the
first
hoyt
he
ever
saw
was
out
of
the
mercantile
library
of
san
francisco
looks
as
if
he
had
brought
her
here
on
purpose
do
it
but
then
that
inconsistent
with
the
of
the
sale
that
the
trouble
with
this
brig
racket
any
one
can
make
half
a
dozen
theories
for
sixty
or
seventy
per
cent
of
it
but
when
they
made
there
always
a
fathom
or
two
of
slack
hanging
out
of
the
other
i
believe
our
attention
fell
next
on
the
papers
of
which
we
had
altogether
a
considerable
bulk
i
had
hoped
to
find
among
these
matter
for
a
character
of
captain
trent
but
here
i
was
doomed
on
the
whole
to
disappointment
we
could
make
out
he
was
an
orderly
man
for
all
his
bills
were
docketed
and
preserved
that
he
was
convivial
and
inclined
to
be
frugal
even
in
conviviality
several
documents
proclaimed
such
letters
as
we
found
were
with
one
exception
arid
notes
from
tradesmen
the
exception
signed
hannah
trent
was
a
somewhat
fervid
appeal
for
a
loan
know
what
misfortunes
i
have
had
to
bear
wrote
hannah
how
much
i
am
disappointed
in
george
the
landlady
appeared
a
true
friend
when
i
first
came
here
and
i
thought
her
a
perfect
lady
but
she
has
come
out
since
then
in
her
true
colours
and
if
you
will
not
be
softened
by
this
last
appeal
i
ca
think
what
is
to
become
of
your
affectionate
and
then
the
signature
this
document
was
without
place
or
date
and
a
voice
told
me
that
it
had
gone
likewise
without
answer
on
the
whole
there
were
few
letters
anywhere
in
the
ship
but
we
found
one
before
we
were
finished
in
a
chest
of
which
i
must
transcribe
some
sentences
it
was
dated
from
some
place
on
the
clyde
dearist
son
it
ran
is
to
tell
you
your
dearist
father
passed
away
jan
twelft
in
the
peace
of
the
lord
he
had
your
photo
and
dear
david
lade
upon
his
bed
made
me
sit
by
him
let
be
a
thegither
he
said
and
gave
you
all
his
blessing
o
my
dear
laddie
why
were
nae
you
and
davie
here
he
would
have
had
a
happier
passage
he
spok
of
both
of
ye
all
night
most
beautiful
and
how
ye
used
to
stravaig
on
the
saturday
afternoons
and
of
auld
kelvinside
sooth
the
tune
to
me
he
said
though
it
was
the
sabbath
and
i
had
to
sooth
him
kelvin
grove
and
he
looked
at
his
fiddle
the
dear
man
i
cannae
bear
the
sight
of
it
he
never
play
it
mair
o
my
lamb
come
home
to
me
i
all
by
my
lane
the
rest
was
in
a
religious
vein
and
quite
conventional
i
have
never
seen
any
one
more
put
out
than
nares
when
i
handed
him
this
letter
he
had
read
but
a
few
words
before
he
cast
it
down
it
was
perhaps
a
minute
ere
he
picked
it
up
again
and
the
performance
was
repeated
the
third
time
before
he
reached
the
end
touching
is
it
said
i
for
all
answer
nares
exploded
in
a
brutal
oath
and
it
was
some
half
an
hour
later
that
he
vouchsafed
an
explanation
tell
you
what
broke
me
up
about
that
letter
said
he
old
man
played
the
fiddle
played
it
all
out
of
tune
one
of
the
things
he
played
was
i
remember
it
was
all
martyrdom
to
me
he
was
a
pig
of
a
father
and
i
was
a
pig
of
a
son
but
it
sort
of
came
over
me
i
would
like
to
hear
that
fiddle
squeak
again
natural
he
added
guess
we
all
sons
are
i
guess
said
i
have
the
same
trouble
on
my
conscience
we
can
shake
hands
on
which
oddly
enough
perhaps
we
did
amongst
the
papers
we
found
a
considerable
sprinkling
of
photographs
for
the
most
part
either
of
very
young
ladies
or
old
women
of
the
persuasion
but
one
among
them
was
the
means
of
our
crowning
discovery
not
pretty
are
they
dodd
said
nares
as
he
passed
it
over
i
asked
mechanically
taking
the
card
it
was
a
in
hand
and
smothering
a
yawn
for
the
hour
was
late
the
day
had
been
laborious
and
i
was
wearying
for
bed
and
company
said
he
a
historic
picture
of
the
i
held
it
to
the
light
my
curiosity
at
a
low
ebb
i
had
seen
captain
trent
once
and
had
no
delight
in
viewing
him
again
it
was
a
photograph
of
the
deck
of
the
brig
taken
from
forward
all
in
order
the
hands
gathered
in
the
waist
the
officers
on
the
poop
at
the
foot
of
the
card
was
written
flying
scud
rangoon
and
a
date
and
above
or
below
each
individual
figure
the
name
had
been
carefully
noted
as
i
continued
to
gaze
a
shock
went
through
me
the
dimness
of
sleep
and
fatigue
lifted
from
my
eyes
as
fog
lifts
in
the
channel
and
i
beheld
with
startled
clearness
the
photographic
presentment
of
a
crowd
of
strangers
trent
at
the
top
of
the
card
directed
me
to
a
smallish
weazened
man
with
bushy
eyebrows
and
full
white
beard
dressed
in
a
frock
coat
and
white
trousers
a
flower
stuck
in
his
his
bearded
chin
set
forward
his
mouth
clenched
with
habitual
determination
there
was
not
much
of
the
sailor
in
his
looks
but
plenty
of
the
martinet
a
dry
precise
man
who
might
pass
for
a
preacher
in
some
rigid
sect
and
whatever
he
was
not
the
captain
trent
of
san
francisco
the
men
too
were
all
new
to
me
the
cook
an
unmistakable
chinaman
in
his
characteristic
dress
standing
apart
on
the
poop
steps
but
perhaps
i
turned
on
the
whole
with
the
greatest
curiosity
to
the
figure
labelled
goddedaal
he
whom
i
had
never
seen
he
might
be
the
identical
he
might
be
the
clue
and
spring
of
all
this
mystery
and
i
scanned
his
features
with
the
eye
of
a
detective
he
was
of
great
stature
seemingly
blonde
as
a
viking
his
hair
clustering
round
his
head
in
frowsy
curls
and
two
enormous
whiskers
like
the
tusks
of
some
strange
animal
jutting
from
his
cheeks
with
these
virile
appendages
and
the
defiant
attitude
in
which
he
stood
the
expression
of
his
face
only
imperfectly
harmonised
it
was
wild
heroic
and
womanish
looking
and
i
felt
i
was
prepared
to
hear
he
was
a
sentimentalist
and
to
see
him
weep
for
some
while
i
digested
my
discovery
in
private
reflecting
how
best
and
how
with
most
of
drama
i
might
share
it
with
the
captain
then
my
came
in
my
head
and
i
fished
it
out
from
where
it
lay
with
other
miscellaneous
possessions
at
the
foot
of
my
bunk
and
turned
to
my
sketch
of
captain
trent
and
the
survivors
of
the
british
brig
flying
scud
in
the
san
francisco
said
i
told
you
how
i
first
saw
captain
trent
in
that
saloon
in
how
he
came
with
his
men
one
of
them
a
kanaka
with
a
in
a
cage
and
how
i
saw
him
afterwards
at
the
auction
frightened
to
death
and
as
much
surprised
at
how
the
figures
skipped
up
as
anybody
there
well
said
i
the
man
i
and
i
laid
the
sketch
before
him
trent
of
and
there
are
his
three
hands
find
one
of
them
in
the
photograph
and
i
be
nares
compared
the
two
in
silence
he
said
at
last
call
this
rather
a
relief
seems
to
clear
the
horizon
we
might
have
guessed
at
something
of
the
kind
from
the
double
ration
of
chests
that
it
explain
anything
i
asked
would
explain
everything
nares
replied
for
the
it
all
tally
as
neat
as
a
patent
puzzle
if
you
leave
out
the
way
these
people
bid
the
wreck
up
and
there
we
come
to
a
stone
wall
but
whatever
it
is
dodd
it
on
the
looks
like
piracy
i
added
like
blind
hookey
cried
the
captain
do
you
deceive
yourself
neither
your
head
nor
mine
is
big
enough
to
put
a
name
on
this
chapter
xv
the
cargo
of
the
in
my
early
days
i
was
a
man
the
most
wedded
to
his
idols
of
my
generation
i
was
a
dweller
under
roofs
the
gull
of
that
which
we
call
civilisation
a
superstitious
votary
of
the
plastic
arts
a
cit
and
a
prop
of
restaurants
i
had
a
comrade
in
those
days
somewhat
of
an
outsider
though
he
moved
in
the
company
of
artists
and
a
man
famous
in
our
small
world
for
gallantry
knee
breeches
and
dry
and
pregnant
sayings
he
looking
on
the
long
meals
and
waxing
bellies
of
the
french
whom
i
confess
i
somewhat
imitated
branded
me
as
cultivator
of
restaurant
and
i
believe
he
had
his
finger
on
the
dangerous
spot
i
believe
if
things
had
gone
smooth
with
me
i
should
be
now
swollen
like
a
in
body
and
fallen
in
mind
to
a
thing
perhaps
as
low
as
many
types
of
bourgeois
the
implicit
or
exclusive
artist
that
was
a
home
word
of
pinkerton
deserving
to
be
writ
in
letters
of
gold
on
the
portico
of
every
school
of
art
i
ca
see
is
why
you
should
want
to
do
nothing
the
dull
man
is
made
not
by
the
nature
but
by
the
degree
of
his
immersion
in
a
single
business
and
all
the
more
if
that
be
sedentary
uneventful
and
ingloriously
safe
more
than
one
half
of
him
will
then
remain
unexercised
and
undeveloped
the
rest
will
be
distended
and
deformed
by
and
the
heat
of
rooms
and
i
have
often
marvelled
at
the
impudence
of
gentlemen
who
describe
and
pass
judgment
on
the
life
of
man
in
almost
perfect
ignorance
of
all
its
necessary
elements
and
natural
careers
those
who
dwell
in
clubs
and
studios
may
paint
excellent
pictures
or
write
enchanting
novels
there
is
one
thing
that
they
should
not
do
they
should
pass
no
judgment
on
man
destiny
for
it
is
a
thing
with
which
they
are
unacquainted
their
own
life
is
an
excrescence
of
the
moment
doomed
in
the
vicissitude
of
history
to
pass
and
disappear
the
eternal
life
of
man
spent
under
sun
and
rain
and
in
rude
physical
effort
lies
upon
one
side
scarce
changed
since
the
beginning
i
would
i
could
have
carried
along
with
me
to
midway
island
all
the
writers
and
the
prating
artists
of
my
time
day
after
day
of
hope
deferred
of
heat
of
unremitting
toil
night
after
night
of
aching
limbs
bruised
hands
and
a
mind
obscured
with
the
grateful
vacancy
of
physical
fatigue
the
scene
the
nature
of
my
employment
the
rugged
speech
and
faces
of
my
the
glare
of
the
day
on
deck
the
stinking
twilight
in
the
bilge
the
shrill
myriads
of
the
above
all
the
sense
of
our
immitigable
isolation
from
the
world
and
from
the
current
epoch
keeping
another
time
some
eras
old
the
new
day
heralded
by
no
daily
paper
only
by
the
rising
sun
and
the
state
the
churches
the
peopled
empires
war
and
the
rumours
of
war
and
the
voices
of
the
arts
all
gone
silent
as
in
the
days
ere
they
were
yet
invented
such
were
the
conditions
of
my
new
experience
in
life
of
which
if
i
had
been
able
i
would
have
had
all
my
confreres
and
contemporaries
to
partake
forgetting
for
that
while
the
orthodoxies
of
the
moment
and
devoted
to
a
single
and
material
purpose
under
the
eye
of
heaven
of
the
nature
of
our
task
i
must
continue
to
give
some
summary
idea
the
forecastle
was
lumbered
with
ship
chandlery
the
hold
nigh
full
of
rice
the
lazarette
crowded
with
the
teas
and
silks
these
must
all
be
dug
out
and
that
made
but
a
fraction
of
our
task
the
hold
was
ceiled
throughout
a
part
where
perhaps
some
delicate
cargo
was
once
stored
had
been
lined
in
addition
with
inch
boards
and
between
every
beam
there
was
a
movable
panel
into
the
bilge
any
of
these
the
bulkheads
of
the
cabins
the
very
timbers
of
the
hull
itself
might
be
the
place
of
hiding
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
demolish
as
we
proceeded
a
great
part
of
the
ship
inner
skin
and
fittings
and
to
auscultate
what
remained
like
a
doctor
sounding
for
a
lung
disease
upon
the
return
from
any
beam
or
bulkhead
of
a
flat
or
doubtful
sound
we
must
up
axe
and
hew
into
the
timber
a
violent
and
from
the
amount
of
dry
rot
in
the
wreck
a
mortifying
exercise
every
night
saw
a
deeper
inroad
into
the
bones
of
the
flying
scud
more
beams
tapped
and
hewn
in
splinters
more
planking
peeled
away
and
tossed
aside
and
every
night
saw
us
as
far
as
ever
from
the
end
and
object
of
our
arduous
devastation
in
this
perpetual
disappointment
my
courage
did
not
fail
me
but
my
spirits
dwindled
and
nares
himself
grew
silent
and
morose
at
night
when
supper
was
done
we
passed
an
hour
in
the
cabin
mostly
without
speech
i
sometimes
dozing
over
a
book
nares
sullenly
but
busily
drilling
with
the
instrument
called
a
yankee
fiddle
a
stranger
might
have
supposed
we
were
estranged
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
silent
comradeship
of
labour
our
intimacy
grew
i
had
been
struck
at
the
first
beginning
of
our
enterprise
upon
the
wreck
to
find
the
men
so
ready
at
the
captain
lightest
word
i
dare
not
say
they
liked
but
i
can
never
deny
that
they
admired
him
thoroughly
a
mild
word
from
his
mouth
was
more
valued
than
flattery
and
half
a
dollar
from
myself
if
he
relaxed
at
all
from
his
habitual
attitude
of
censure
smiling
alacrity
surrounded
him
and
i
was
led
to
think
his
theory
of
captainship
even
if
pushed
to
excess
reposed
upon
some
ground
of
reason
but
even
terror
and
admiration
of
the
captain
failed
us
before
the
end
the
men
wearied
of
the
hopeless
unremunerative
quest
and
the
long
strain
of
labour
they
began
to
shirk
and
grumble
retribution
fell
on
them
at
once
and
retribution
multiplied
the
grumblings
with
every
day
it
took
harder
driving
to
keep
them
to
the
daily
drudge
and
we
in
our
narrow
boundaries
were
kept
conscious
every
moment
of
the
of
our
assistants
in
spite
of
the
best
care
the
object
of
our
search
was
perfectly
well
known
to
all
on
board
and
there
had
leaked
out
besides
some
knowledge
of
those
inconsistencies
that
had
so
greatly
amazed
the
captain
and
myself
i
could
overhear
the
men
debate
the
character
of
captain
trent
and
set
forth
competing
theories
of
where
the
opium
was
stowed
and
as
they
seemed
to
have
been
eavesdropping
on
ourselves
i
thought
little
shame
to
prick
up
my
ears
when
i
had
the
return
chance
of
spying
upon
them
in
this
way
i
could
diagnose
their
temper
and
judge
how
far
they
were
informed
upon
the
mystery
of
the
flying
scud
it
was
after
having
thus
overheard
some
almost
mutinous
speeches
that
a
fortunate
idea
crossed
my
mind
at
night
i
matured
it
in
my
bed
and
the
first
thing
the
next
morning
broached
it
to
the
captain
i
spirit
up
the
hands
a
bit
i
asked
the
offer
of
a
reward
you
think
you
getting
your
month
wages
out
of
them
the
way
it
is
i
do
was
his
reply
they
are
all
the
men
you
got
and
you
the
this
from
a
person
of
the
captain
character
might
be
regarded
as
complete
adhesion
and
the
crew
were
accordingly
called
aft
never
had
the
captain
worn
a
front
more
menacing
it
was
supposed
by
all
that
some
misdeed
had
been
discovered
and
some
surprising
punishment
was
to
be
announced
here
you
he
threw
at
them
over
his
shoulder
as
he
walked
the
deck
dodd
here
is
going
to
offer
a
reward
to
the
first
man
who
strikes
the
opium
in
that
wreck
there
two
ways
of
making
a
donkey
go
both
good
i
guess
the
one
kicks
and
the
other
carrots
going
to
try
the
carrots
well
my
sons
and
here
he
faced
the
men
for
the
first
time
with
his
hands
behind
him
that
opium
not
found
in
five
days
you
can
come
to
me
for
the
he
nodded
to
the
present
narrator
who
took
up
the
tale
is
what
i
propose
men
said
i
put
up
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
if
any
man
can
lay
hands
on
the
stuff
right
away
and
off
his
own
club
he
shall
have
the
hundred
and
fifty
down
if
any
one
can
put
us
on
the
scent
of
where
to
look
he
shall
have
a
hundred
and
and
the
balance
shall
be
for
the
lucky
one
who
actually
picks
it
up
we
call
it
the
pinkerton
stakes
captain
i
added
with
a
smile
it
the
grand
combination

then
cries

i
go

look
here

make
up
this
to

hundred
and
fifty

gold
you
captain
nares
said
i
was
handsomely
was
kindly
meant
he
returned
the
offer
was
not
made
in
vain
the
hands
had
scarce
yet
realised
the
magnitude
of
the
reward
they
had
scarce
begun
to
buzz
aloud
in
the
extremity
of
hope
and
wonder
ere
the
chinese
cook
stepped
forward
with
gracious
gestures
and
explanatory
smiles
he
began

little
sooner

replied
the
cook
with
smiling
dignity
you
ca
say
fairer
than
that
the
captain
admitted
now
the
reward
offered
you
talk
speak
up
then
suppose
you
speak

how
does
that
strike
you
asked
the
captain
may
be
right
he
may
be

he
likely
to
be
right
for
if
he
is
where
can
the
stuff
be
on
the
other
hand
if
he
wrong
we
destroy
a
hundred
and
fifty
tons
of
good
rice
for
nothing
it
a
point
to
be
do
hesitate
said
i
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
thing
the
rice
is
nothing
the
rice
will
neither
make
nor
break
how
i
expected
you
to
see
it
returned
nares
and
we
called
the
boat
away
and
set
forth
on
our
new
quest
the
hold
was
now
almost
entirely
emptied
the
mats
of
which
there
went
forty
to
the
short
ton
had
been
stacked
on
deck
and
now
crowded
the
ship
waist
and
forecastle
it
was
our
task
to
disembowel
and
explore
six
thousand
individual
mats
and
incidentally
to
destroy
a
hundred
and
fifty
tons
of
valuable
food
nor
were
the
circumstances
of
the
business
less
strange
than
its
essential
nature
each
man
of
us
armed
with
a
great
knife
attacked
the
pile
from
his
own
quarter
slashed
into
the
nearest
mat
burrowed
in
it
with
his
hands
and
shed
forth
the
rice
upon
the
deck
where
it
heaped
up
overflowed
and
was
trodden
down
poured
at
last
into
the
scuppers
and
occasionally
spouted
from
the
vents
about
the
wreck
thus
transformed
into
an
overflowing
granary
the
swarmed
in
myriads
and
with
surprising
insolence
the
sight
of
so
much
food
confounded
them
they
deafened
us
with
their
shrill
tongues
swooped
in
our
midst
dashed
in
our
faces
and
snatched
the
grain
from
between
our
fingers
the
men
their
hands
bleeding
from
these
assaults
turned
savagely
on
the
offensive
drove
their
knives
into
the
birds
drew
them
out
crimsoned
and
turned
again
to
dig
among
the
rice
unmindful
of
the
gawking
creatures
that
struggled
and
died
among
their
feet
we
made
a
singular
picture
the
hovering
and
diving
birds
the
bodies
of
the
dead
discolouring
the
rice
with
blood
the
scuppers
vomiting
breadstuff
the
men
frenzied
by
the
gold
hunt
toiling
slaying
and
shouting
aloud
over
all
the
lofty
intricacy
of
rigging
and
the
radiant
heaven
of
the
pacific
every
man
there
toiled
in
the
immediate
hope
of
fifty
dollars
and
i
of
fifty
thousand
small
wonder
if
we
waded
callously
in
blood
and
food
it
was
perhaps
about
ten
in
the
forenoon
when
the
scene
was
interrupted
nares
who
had
just
ripped
open
a
fresh
mat
drew
forth
and
slung
at
his
feet
among
the
rice
a
papered
tin
box
that
he
shouted
a
cry
broke
from
all
hands
the
next
moment
forgetting
their
own
disappointment
in
that
contagious
sentiment
of
success
they
gave
three
cheers
that
scared
the
and
the
next
they
had
crowded
round
the
captain
and
were
jostling
together
and
groping
with
emulous
hands
in
the
mat
box
after
box
rewarded
them
six
in
all
wrapped
as
i
have
said
in
a
paper
envelope
and
the
paper
printed
on
in
chinese
characters
nares
turned
to
me
and
shook
my
hand
began
to
think
we
should
never
see
this
day
said
he
congratulate
you
dodd
on
having
pulled
it
the
captain
tones
affected
me
profoundly
and
when
johnson
and
the
men
pressed
round
me
in
turn
with
congratulations
the
tears
came
in
my
eyes
are
boxes
more
than
two
pounds
said
nares
weighing
one
in
his
hand
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
to
the
mat
lay
into
it
boys
we
make
dodd
a
millionnaire
before
it
was
strange
to
see
with
what
a
fury
we
fell
to
the
men
had
now
nothing
to
expect
the
mere
idea
of
great
sums
inspired
them
with
disinterested
ardour
mats
were
slashed
and
disembowelled
the
rice
flowed
to
our
knees
in
the
ship
waist
the
sweat
ran
in
our
eyes
and
blinded
us
our
arms
ached
to
agony
and
yet
our
fire
abated
not
dinner
came
we
were
too
weary
to
eat
too
hoarse
for
conversation
and
yet
dinner
was
scarce
done
before
we
were
afoot
again
and
delving
in
the
rice
before
nightfall
not
a
mat
was
unexplored
and
we
were
face
to
face
with
the
astonishing
result
for
of
all
the
inexplicable
things
in
the
story
of
the
flying
scud
here
was
the
most
inexplicable
out
of
the
six
thousand
mats
only
twenty
were
found
to
have
been
sugared
in
each
we
found
the
same
amount
about
twelve
pounds
of
drug
making
a
grand
total
of
two
hundred
and
forty
pounds
by
the
last
san
francisco
quotation
opium
was
selling
for
a
fraction
over
twenty
dollars
a
pound
but
it
had
been
known
not
long
before
to
bring
as
much
as
forty
in
honolulu
where
it
was
contraband
taking
then
this
high
honolulu
figure
the
value
of
the
opium
on
board
the
flying
scud
fell
considerably
short
of
ten
thousand
dollars
while
at
the
san
francisco
rate
it
lacked
a
trifle
of
five
thousand
and
fifty
thousand
was
the
price
that
jim
and
i
had
paid
for
it
and
bellairs
had
been
eager
to
go
higher
there
is
no
language
to
express
the
stupor
with
which
i
contemplated
this
result
it
may
be
argued
we
were
not
yet
sure
there
might
be
yet
another
cache
and
you
may
be
certain
in
that
hour
of
my
distress
the
argument
was
not
forgotten
there
was
never
a
ship
more
ardently
perquested
no
stone
was
left
unturned
and
no
expedient
untried
day
after
day
of
growing
despair
we
punched
and
dug
in
the
brig
vitals
exciting
the
men
with
promises
and
presents
evening
after
evening
nares
and
i
sat
face
to
face
in
the
narrow
cabin
racking
our
minds
for
some
neglected
possibility
of
search
i
could
stake
my
salvation
on
the
certainty
of
the
result
in
all
that
ship
there
was
nothing
left
of
value
but
the
timber
and
the
copper
nails
so
that
our
case
was
lamentably
plain
we
had
paid
fifty
thousand
dollars
borne
the
charges
of
the
schooner
and
paid
fancy
interest
on
money
and
if
things
went
well
with
us
we
might
realise
fifteen
per
cent
of
the
first
outlay
we
were
not
merely
bankrupt
we
were
comic
bankrupts
a
fair
butt
for
jeering
in
the
streets
i
hope
i
bore
the
blow
with
a
good
countenance
indeed
my
mind
had
long
been
quite
made
up
and
since
the
day
we
found
the
opium
i
had
known
the
result
but
the
thought
of
jim
and
mamie
ached
in
me
like
a
physical
pain
and
i
shrank
from
speech
and
companionship
i
was
in
this
frame
of
mind
when
the
captain
proposed
that
we
should
land
upon
the
island
i
saw
he
had
something
to
say
and
only
feared
it
might
be
consolation
for
i
could
just
bear
my
grief
not
bungling
sympathy
and
yet
i
had
no
choice
but
to
accede
to
his
proposal
we
walked
awhile
along
the
beach
in
silence
the
sun
overhead
reverberated
rays
of
heat
the
staring
sand
the
glaring
lagoon
tortured
our
eyes
and
the
birds
and
the
boom
of
the
breakers
made
a
savage
symphony
do
require
to
tell
you
the
game
up
nares
asked
said
i
was
thinking
of
getting
to
sea
he
pursued
best
thing
you
can
do
said
i
we
say
honolulu
he
inquired
yes
let
stick
to
the
programme
i
cried
be
it
there
was
another
silence
and
then
nares
cleared
his
throat
been
pretty
good
friends
you
and
me
dodd
he
resumed
been
going
through
the
kind
of
thing
that
tries
a
man
we
had
the
hardest
kind
of
work
we
been
badly
backed
and
now
we
badly
beaten
and
we
fetched
through
without
a
word
of
disagreement
i
do
say
this
to
praise
myself
it
my
trade
it
what
i
paid
for
and
trained
for
and
brought
up
to
but
it
was
another
thing
for
you
it
was
all
new
to
you
and
it
did
me
good
to
see
you
stand
right
up
to
it
and
swing
right
into
it
day
in
day
out
and
then
see
how
you
taken
this
disappointment
when
everybody
knows
you
must
have
been
tautened
up
to
i
wish
you
let
me
tell
you
dodd
that
stood
out
mighty
manly
and
handsomely
in
all
this
business
and
made
every
one
like
you
and
admire
you
and
i
wish
you
let
me
tell
you
besides
that
i
taken
this
wreck
business
as
much
to
heart
as
you
have
something
kind
of
rises
in
my
throat
when
i
think
we
beaten
and
if
i
thought
waiting
would
do
it
i
would
stick
on
this
reef
until
we
i
tried
in
vain
to
thank
him
for
these
generous
words
but
he
was
beforehand
with
me
in
a
moment
did
bring
you
ashore
to
sound
my
praises
he
interrupted
understand
one
another
now
that
all
and
i
guess
you
can
trust
me
what
i
wished
to
speak
about
is
more
important
and
it
got
to
be
faced
what
are
we
to
do
about
the
flying
scud
and
the
dime
novel
really
have
thought
nothing
about
that
i
replied
i
expect
i
mean
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
it
and
if
the
bogus
captain
trent
is
to
be
found
on
the
earth
surface
i
guess
i
mean
to
find
you
got
to
do
is
talk
said
nares
can
make
the
biggest
kind
of
boom
it
is
often
the
reporters
have
a
chance
at
such
a
yarn
as
this
and
i
can
tell
you
how
it
will
go
it
will
go
by
telegraph
dodd
it
be
telegraphed
by
the
column
and
and
frothed
up
and
denied
by
authority
and
it
hit
bogus
captain
trent
in
a
mexican
and
knock
over
bogus
goddedaal
in
a
slum
somewhere
up
the
baltic
and
bowl
down
hardy
and
brown
in
sailors
music
halls
round
greenock
o
there
no
doubt
you
can
have
a
regular
domestic
judgment
day
the
only
point
is
whether
you
deliberately
want
said
i
deliberately
do
want
one
thing
i
deliberately
do
want
to
make
a
public
exhibition
of
myself
and
pinkerton
so
moral
smuggling
opium
such
damned
fools
paying
fifty
thousand
for
a
horse
doubt
it
might
damage
you
in
a
business
sense
the
captain
agreed
i
pleased
you
take
that
view
for
i
turned
kind
of
soft
upon
the
job
there
been
some
crookedness
about
no
doubt
of
it
but
law
bless
you
if
we
dropped
upon
the
troupe
all
the
premier
artists
would
slip
right
out
with
the
boodle
in
their
and
you
only
collar
a
lot
of
old
that
did
know
the
back
of
the
business
from
the
front
i
do
take
much
stock
in
mercantile
jack
you
know
that
but
poor
devil
he
got
to
go
where
he
told
and
if
you
make
trouble
ten
to
one
it
make
you
sick
to
see
the
innocents
who
have
to
stand
the
racket
it
would
be
different
if
we
understood
the
operation
but
we
do
you
see
there
a
lot
of
queer
corners
in
life
and
my
vote
is
to
let
the
blame
thing
speak
as
if
we
had
that
in
our
power
i
objected
so
we
have
said
he
about
the
men
i
asked
know
too
much
by
half
and
you
ca
keep
them
from
i
returned
nares
bet
a
can
they
can
be
all
when
they
get
ashore
blind
drunk
by
dark
and
cruising
out
of
the
golden
gate
in
different
ships
by
the
next
morning
ca
keep
them
from
talking
ca
i
well
i
can
make
talk
separate
leastways
if
a
whole
crew
came
talking
parties
would
listen
but
if
it
only
one
lone
old
it
the
usual
yarn
and
at
least
they
need
talk
before
six
months
or
if
we
have
luck
and
there
a
whaler
handy
three
years
and
by
that
time
dodd
ancient
what
they
call
shanghaiing
is
it
i
asked
thought
it
belonged
to
the
dime
dime
novels
are
right
enough
returned
the
captain
wrong
with
the
dime
novel
only
that
things
happen
thicker
than
they
do
in
life
and
the
practical
seamanship
is
we
can
keep
the
business
to
ourselves
i
mused
one
other
person
that
might
blab
said
the
captain
i
do
believe
she
has
anything
left
to
who
is
she
i
asked
old
girl
there
he
answered
pointing
to
the
wreck
know
there
nothing
in
her
but
somehow
i
afraid
of
some
one
else
the
last
thing
you
expect
so
it
just
the
first
that
happen
some
one
dropping
into
this
island
where
nobody
drops
in
waltzing
into
that
wreck
that
we
grown
old
with
searching
stooping
straight
down
and
picking
right
up
the
very
thing
that
tells
the
story
what
that
to
me
you
may
ask
and
why
am
i
gone
soft
tommy
on
this
museum
of
crooks
they
smashed
up
you
and
pinkerton
turned
my
hair
grey
with
conundrums
they
been
up
to
larks
no
doubt
and
that
all
i
know
of
them
you
say
well
and
that
just
where
it
is
i
do
know
enough
i
do
know
what
uppermost
it
just
such
a
lot
of
miscellaneous
eventualities
as
i
do
care
to
go
stirring
up
and
i
ask
you
to
let
me
deal
with
the
old
girl
after
a
patent
of
my
what
you
please
said
i
scarce
with
attention
for
a
new
thought
now
occupied
my
brain
i
broke
out
are
wrong
we
can
not
hush
this
up
there
is
one
thing
you
have
is
that
he
asked
bogus
captain
trent
a
bogus
goddedaal
a
whole
bogus
crew
have
all
started
home
said
i
we
are
right
not
one
of
them
will
reach
his
journey
end
and
do
you
mean
to
say
that
such
a
circumstance
as
that
can
pass
without
remark
said
the
captain
sailors
if
they
were
all
bound
for
one
place
in
a
body
i
do
say
so
but
they
all
going
separate
to
hull
to
sweden
to
the
clyde
to
the
thames
well
at
each
place
what
is
it
nothing
new
only
one
sailor
man
missing
got
drunk
or
got
drowned
or
got
left
the
proper
sailor
something
bitter
in
the
thought
and
in
the
speaker
tones
struck
me
hard
is
one
that
has
got
left
i
cried
getting
sharply
to
my
feet
for
we
had
been
some
time
seated
wish
it
were
the
other
i
do
do
relish
going
home
to
jim
with
this
here
said
nares
with
ready
tact
must
be
getting
aboard
johnson
in
the
brig
annexing
chandlery
and
canvas
and
there
some
things
in
the
norah
that
want
fixing
against
we
go
to
sea
would
you
like
to
be
left
here
in
the
i
send
for
you
to
i
embraced
the
proposal
with
delight
solitude
in
my
frame
of
mind
was
not
too
dearly
purchased
at
the
risk
of
sunstroke
or
and
soon
i
was
alone
on
the
islet
i
should
find
it
hard
to
tell
of
what
i
thought
of
jim
of
mamie
of
our
lost
fortune
of
my
lost
hopes
of
the
doom
before
me
to
turn
to
at
some
mechanical
occupation
in
some
subaltern
rank
and
to
toil
there
unremarked
and
unamused
until
the
hour
of
the
last
deliverance
i
was
at
least
so
sunk
in
sadness
that
i
scarce
remarked
where
i
was
going
and
chance
or
some
finer
sense
that
lives
in
us
and
only
guides
us
when
the
mind
is
in
abeyance
conducted
my
steps
into
a
quarter
of
the
island
where
the
birds
were
few
by
some
devious
route
which
i
was
unable
to
retrace
for
my
return
i
was
thus
able
to
mount
without
interruption
to
the
highest
point
of
land
and
here
i
was
recalled
to
consciousness
by
a
last
discovery
the
spot
on
which
i
stood
was
level
and
commanded
a
wide
view
of
the
lagoon
the
bounding
reef
the
round
horizon
nearer
hand
i
saw
the
sister
islet
the
wreck
the
norah
creina
and
the
norah
boat
already
moving
shoreward
for
the
sun
was
now
low
flaming
on
the
sea
verge
and
the
galley
chimney
smoked
on
board
the
schooner
it
thus
befell
that
though
my
discovery
was
both
affecting
and
suggestive
i
had
no
leisure
to
examine
further
what
i
saw
was
the
blackened
embers
of
fire
of
wreck
by
all
the
signs
it
must
have
blazed
to
a
good
height
and
burned
for
days
from
the
scantling
of
a
spar
that
lay
upon
the
margin
only
half
consumed
it
must
have
been
the
work
of
more
than
one
and
i
received
at
once
the
image
of
a
forlorn
troop
of
castaways
houseless
in
that
lost
corner
of
the
earth
and
feeding
there
their
fire
of
signal
the
next
moment
a
hail
reached
me
from
the
boat
and
bursting
through
the
bushes
and
the
rising
i
said
farewell
i
trust
for
ever
to
that
desert
isle
chapter
xvi
in
which
i
turn
smuggler
and
the
captain
casuist
the
last
night
at
midway
i
had
little
sleep
the
next
morning
after
the
sun
was
risen
and
the
clatter
of
departure
had
begun
to
reign
on
deck
i
lay
a
long
while
dozing
and
when
at
last
i
stepped
from
the
companion
the
schooner
was
already
leaping
through
the
pass
into
the
open
sea
close
on
her
board
the
huge
scroll
of
a
breaker
unfurled
itself
along
the
reef
with
a
prodigious
clamour
and
behind
i
saw
the
wreck
vomiting
into
the
morning
air
a
coil
of
smoke
the
wreaths
already
blew
out
far
to
leeward
flames
already
glittered
in
the
cabin
skylight
and
the
were
scattered
in
surprise
as
wide
as
the
lagoon
as
we
drew
farther
off
the
conflagration
of
the
flying
scud
flamed
higher
and
long
after
we
had
dropped
all
signs
of
midway
island
the
smoke
still
hung
in
the
horizon
like
that
of
a
distant
steamer
with
the
fading
out
of
that
last
vestige
the
norah
creina
passed
again
into
the
empty
world
of
cloud
and
water
by
which
she
had
approached
and
the
next
features
that
appeared
eleven
days
later
to
break
the
line
of
sky
were
the
arid
mountains
of
oahu
it
has
often
since
been
a
comfortable
thought
to
me
that
we
had
thus
destroyed
the
remnants
of
the
flying
scud
and
often
a
strange
one
that
my
last
sight
and
reminiscence
of
that
fatal
ship
should
be
a
pillar
of
smoke
on
the
horizon
to
so
many
others
besides
myself
the
same
appearance
had
played
a
part
in
the
various
stages
of
that
business
luring
some
to
what
they
little
imagined
filling
some
with
unimaginable
terrors
but
ours
was
the
last
smoke
raised
in
the
story
and
with
its
dying
away
the
secret
of
the
flying
scud
became
a
private
property
it
was
by
the
first
light
of
dawn
that
we
saw
close
on
board
the
metropolitan
island
of
hawaii
we
held
along
the
coast
as
near
as
we
could
venture
with
a
fresh
breeze
and
under
an
unclouded
heaven
beholding
as
we
went
the
arid
mountain
sides
and
scrubby
of
that
somewhat
melancholy
archipelago
about
four
of
the
afternoon
we
turned
waimanolo
point
the
westerly
headland
of
the
great
bight
of
honolulu
showed
ourselves
for
twenty
minutes
in
full
view
and
then
fell
again
to
leeward
and
put
in
the
rest
of
daylight
plying
under
shortened
sail
under
the
lee
of
waimanolo
a
little
after
dark
we
beat
once
more
about
the
point
and
crept
cautiously
toward
the
mouth
of
the
pearl
lochs
where
jim
and
i
had
arranged
i
was
to
meet
the
smugglers
the
night
was
happily
obscure
the
water
smooth
we
showed
according
to
instructions
no
light
on
deck
only
a
red
lantern
dropped
from
either
cathead
to
within
a
couple
of
feet
of
the
water
a
lookout
was
stationed
on
the
bowsprit
end
another
in
the
crosstrees
and
the
whole
ship
company
crowded
forward
scouting
for
enemies
or
friends
it
was
now
the
crucial
moment
of
our
enterprise
we
were
now
risking
liberty
and
credit
and
that
for
a
sum
so
small
to
a
man
in
my
bankrupt
situation
that
i
could
have
laughed
aloud
in
bitterness
but
the
piece
had
been
arranged
and
we
must
play
it
to
the
finish
for
some
while
we
saw
nothing
but
the
dark
mountain
outline
of
the
island
the
torches
of
native
fishermen
glittering
here
and
there
along
the
foreshore
and
right
in
the
midst
that
cluster
of
brave
lights
with
which
the
town
of
honolulu
advertises
itself
to
the
seaward
presently
a
ruddy
star
appeared
inshore
of
us
and
seemed
to
draw
near
unsteadily
this
was
the
anticipated
signal
and
we
made
haste
to
show
the
countersign
lowering
a
white
light
from
the
quarter
extinguishing
the
two
others
and
laying
the
schooner
incontinently
to
the
star
approached
slowly
the
sounds
of
oars
and
of
men
speech
came
to
us
across
the
water
and
then
a
voice
hailed
us
that
dodd
i
returned
jim
pinkerton
there
sir
replied
the
voice
there
one
of
his
crowd
here
name
of
here
dodd
added
speedy
himself
have
letters
for
right
i
replied
aboard
gentlemen
and
let
me
see
my
a
whaleboat
accordingly
ranged
alongside
and
three
men
boarded
us
my
old
san
francisco
friend
the
speedy
a
little
wizened
person
of
the
name
of
sharpe
and
a
big
flourishing
man
called
fowler
the
two
last
i
learned
afterward
were
frequent
partners
sharpe
supplied
the
capital
and
fowler
who
was
quite
a
character
in
the
islands
and
occupied
a
considerable
station
brought
activity
daring
and
a
private
influence
highly
necessary
in
the
case
both
seemed
to
approach
the
business
with
a
keen
sense
of
romance
and
i
believe
this
was
the
chief
attraction
at
least
with
fowler
for
whom
i
early
conceived
a
sentiment
of
liking
but
in
that
first
moment
i
had
something
else
to
think
of
than
to
judge
my
new
acquaintances
and
before
speedy
had
fished
out
the
letters
the
full
extent
of
our
misfortune
was
revealed
rather
bad
news
for
you
dodd
said
fowler
gone
i
exclaimed
it
was
thought
rather
a
wonder
pinkerton
held
on
as
long
as
he
did
was
the
reply
wreck
deal
was
too
big
for
your
credit
you
were
doing
a
big
business
no
doubt
but
you
were
doing
it
on
precious
little
capital
and
when
the
strain
came
you
were
bound
to
go
pinkerton
through
all
right
seven
cents
dividend
some
remarks
made
but
nothing
to
hurt
the
press
let
you
down
easy
i
guess
jim
had
relations
there
the
only
trouble
is
that
all
this
flying
scud
affair
got
in
the
papers
with
the
rest
everybody
wide
awake
in
honolulu
and
the
sooner
we
get
the
stuff
in
and
the
dollars
out
the
better
for
all
said
i
must
excuse
me
my
friend
the
captain
here
will
drink
a
glass
of
champagne
with
you
to
give
you
patience
but
as
for
myself
i
am
unfit
even
for
ordinary
conversation
till
i
have
read
these
they
demurred
a
little
and
indeed
the
danger
of
delay
seemed
obvious
but
the
sight
of
my
distress
which
i
was
unable
entirely
to
control
appealed
strongly
to
their
and
i
was
suffered
at
last
to
get
by
myself
on
deck
where
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
smuggled
under
shelter
of
the
low
rail
i
read
the
following
wretched
correspondence
dear
loudon
ran
the
first
will
be
handed
you
by
your
friend
speedy
of
the
catamount
his
sterling
character
and
loyal
devotion
to
yourself
pointed
him
out
as
the
best
man
for
our
purposes
in
honolulu
the
parties
on
the
spot
being
difficult
to
manipulate
a
man
called
billy
fowler
you
must
have
heard
of
billy
is
the
boss
he
is
in
politics
some
and
squares
the
officers
i
have
hard
times
before
me
in
the
city
but
i
feel
as
bright
as
a
dollar
and
as
strong
as
john
sullivan
what
with
mamie
here
and
my
partner
speeding
over
the
seas
and
the
bonanza
in
the
wreck
i
feel
like
i
could
juggle
with
the
pyramids
of
egypt
same
as
conjurers
do
with
aluminium
balls
my
earnest
prayers
follow
you
loudon
that
you
may
feel
the
way
i
do
just
inspired
my
feet
do
touch
the
ground
i
kind
of
swim
mamie
is
like
moses
and
aaron
that
held
up
the
other
individual
arms
she
carries
me
along
like
a
horse
and
buggy
i
am
beating
the
record
true
partner
number
two
was
in
a
different
style
dearest
loudon
how
am
i
to
prepare
you
for
this
dire
intelligence
o
dear
me
it
will
strike
you
to
the
earth
the
fiat
has
gone
forth
our
firm
went
bust
at
a
quarter
before
twelve
it
was
a
bill
of
for
that
brought
these
vast
operations
to
a
close
and
evolved
liabilities
of
upwards
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
o
the
shame
and
pity
of
it
and
you
but
three
weeks
gone
loudon
do
blame
your
partner
if
human
hands
and
brains
could
have
sufficed
i
would
have
held
the
thing
together
but
it
just
slowly
crumbled
bradley
was
the
last
kick
but
the
blamed
business
just
melted
i
give
the
liabilities
it
supposed
they
all
in
for
the
cowards
were
waiting
and
the
claims
were
filed
like
taking
tickets
to
hear
patti
i
do
quite
have
the
hang
of
the
assets
yet
our
interests
were
so
extended
but
i
am
at
it
day
and
night
and
i
guess
will
make
a
creditable
dividend
if
the
wreck
pans
out
only
half
the
way
it
ought
we
turn
the
laugh
still
i
am
as
full
of
grit
and
work
as
ever
and
just
tower
above
our
troubles
mamie
is
a
host
in
herself
somehow
i
feel
like
it
was
only
me
that
had
gone
bust
and
you
and
she
soared
clear
of
it
hurry
up
that
all
you
have
to
do
ever
the
third
was
yet
more
altered
poor
loudon
it
began
labour
far
into
the
night
getting
our
affairs
in
order
you
could
not
believe
their
vastness
and
complexity
douglas
longhurst
said
humorously
that
the
receiver
work
would
be
cut
out
for
him
i
can
not
deny
that
some
of
them
have
a
speculative
look
god
forbid
a
sensitive
refined
spirit
like
yours
should
ever
come
face
to
face
with
a
commissioner
in
bankruptcy
these
men
get
all
the
sweetness
knocked
right
out
of
them
but
i
could
bear
up
better
if
it
were
for
press
comments
often
and
often
loudon
i
recall
to
mind
your
most
legitimate
critiques
of
the
press
system
they
published
an
interview
with
me
not
the
least
like
what
i
said
and
with
jeering
comments
it
would
make
your
blood
boil
it
was
literally
inhumane
i
would
have
written
it
about
a
yellow
dog
that
was
in
trouble
like
what
i
am
mamie
just
winced
the
first
time
she
has
turned
a
hair
right
through
the
whole
catastrophe
how
wonderfully
true
was
what
you
said
long
ago
in
paris
about
touching
on
people
personal
appearance
the
fellow
said
and
then
these
words
had
been
scored
through
and
my
distressed
friend
turned
to
another
subject
can
not
bear
to
dwell
upon
our
assets
they
simply
do
show
up
even
thirteen
star
as
sound
a
line
as
can
be
produced
upon
this
coast
goes
begging
the
wreck
has
thrown
a
blight
on
all
we
ever
touched
and
where
the
use
god
never
made
a
wreck
big
enough
to
fill
our
deficit
i
am
haunted
by
the
thought
that
you
may
blame
me
i
know
how
i
despised
your
remonstrances
o
loudon
do
be
hard
on
your
miserable
partner
the
business
is
what
kills
i
fear
your
stern
rectitude
of
mind
like
the
eye
of
god
i
can
not
think
but
what
some
of
my
books
seem
mixed
up
otherwise
i
do
seem
to
see
my
way
as
plain
as
i
could
wish
to
or
else
my
brain
is
gone
soft
loudon
if
there
should
be
any
unpleasantness
you
can
trust
me
to
do
the
right
thing
and
keep
you
clear
i
been
telling
them
already
how
you
had
no
business
grip
and
never
saw
the
books
o
i
trust
i
have
done
right
in
this
i
knew
it
was
a
liberty
i
know
you
may
justly
complain
but
it
was
some
things
that
were
said
and
mind
you
all
legitimate
business
not
even
your
shrinking
sensitiveness
could
find
fault
with
the
first
look
of
one
of
them
if
they
had
panned
out
right
and
you
know
the
flying
scud
was
the
biggest
gamble
of
the
crowd
and
that
was
your
own
idea
mamie
says
she
never
could
bear
to
look
you
in
the
face
if
that
idea
had
been
mine
she
is
so
conscientious
the
last
began
without
formality
is
the
end
of
me
commercially
i
give
up
my
nerve
is
gone
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
glad
for
we
through
the
court
i
do
know
as
ever
i
knew
how
and
i
sure
i
do
remember
if
it
pans
out
the
wreck
i
mean
we
go
to
europe
and
live
on
the
interest
of
our
money
no
more
work
for
me
i
shake
when
people
speak
to
me
i
have
gone
on
hoping
and
hoping
and
working
and
working
and
the
lead
has
pinched
right
out
i
want
to
lie
on
my
back
in
a
garden
and
read
shakespeare
and
roe
do
suppose
it
cowardice
loudon
i
a
sick
man
rest
is
what
i
must
have
i
worked
hard
all
my
life
i
never
spared
myself
every
dollar
i
ever
made
i
coined
my
brains
for
it
i
never
done
a
mean
thing
i
lived
respectable
and
given
to
the
poor
who
has
a
better
right
to
a
holiday
than
i
have
and
i
mean
to
have
a
year
of
it
straight
out
and
if
i
do
i
shall
lie
right
down
here
in
my
tracks
and
die
of
worry
and
brain
trouble
do
mistake
that
so
if
there
are
any
pickings
at
all
trust
speedy
do
let
the
creditors
get
wind
of
what
there
is
i
helped
you
when
you
were
down
help
me
now
deceive
yourself
you
got
to
help
me
right
now
or
never
i
am
clerking
and
not
fit
to
cypher
mamie
typewriting
at
the
phoenix
guano
exchange
down
town
the
light
is
right
out
of
my
life
i
know
you
not
like
to
do
what
i
propose
think
only
of
this
that
it
life
or
death
for
pinkerton
our
figure
was
seven
per
cent
o
what
a
fall
was
there
well
well
it
past
mending
i
do
want
to
whine
but
loudon
i
do
want
to
live
no
more
ambition
all
i
ask
is
life
i
have
so
much
to
make
it
sweet
to
me
i
am
clerking
and
useless
at
that
i
know
i
would
have
fired
such
a
clerk
inside
of
forty
minutes
in
my
time
but
my
over
i
can
only
cling
on
to
you
do
fail
there
was
yet
one
more
postscript
yet
one
more
outburst
of
and
pathetic
adjuration
and
a
doctor
opinion
unpromising
enough
was
besides
enclosed
i
pass
them
both
in
silence
i
think
shame
to
have
shown
at
so
great
length
the
virtues
of
my
friend
dissolving
in
the
crucible
of
sickness
and
distress
and
the
effect
upon
my
spirits
can
be
judged
already
i
got
to
my
feet
when
i
had
done
drew
a
deep
breath
and
stared
hard
at
honolulu
one
moment
the
world
seemed
at
an
end
the
next
i
was
conscious
of
a
rush
of
independent
energy
on
jim
i
could
rely
no
longer
i
must
now
take
hold
myself
i
must
decide
and
act
on
my
own
better
thoughts
the
word
was
easy
to
say
the
thing
at
the
first
blush
was
undiscoverable
i
was
overwhelmed
with
miserable
womanish
pity
for
my
broken
friend
his
outcries
grieved
my
spirit
i
saw
him
then
and
now
then
so
invincible
now
brought
so
low
and
knew
neither
how
to
refuse
nor
how
to
consent
to
his
proposal
the
remembrance
of
my
father
who
had
fallen
in
the
same
field
unstained
the
image
of
his
monument
incongruously
rising
a
fear
of
the
law
a
chill
air
that
seemed
to
blow
upon
my
fancy
from
the
doors
of
prisons
and
the
imaginary
clank
of
fetters
recalled
me
to
a
different
resolve
and
then
again
the
wails
of
my
sick
partner
intervened
so
i
stood
hesitating
and
yet
with
a
strong
sense
of
capacity
behind
sure
if
i
could
but
choose
my
path
that
i
should
walk
in
it
with
resolution
then
i
remembered
that
i
had
a
friend
on
board
and
stepped
to
the
companion
said
i
a
few
moments
more
but
these
i
regret
to
say
i
must
make
more
tedious
still
by
removing
your
companion
it
is
indispensable
that
i
should
have
a
word
or
two
with
captain
both
the
smugglers
were
afoot
at
once
protesting
the
business
they
declared
must
be
despatched
at
once
they
had
run
risk
enough
with
a
conscience
and
they
must
either
finish
now
or
go
choice
is
yours
gentlemen
said
i
i
believe
the
eagerness
i
am
not
yet
sure
that
i
have
anything
in
your
way
even
if
i
have
there
are
a
hundred
things
to
be
considered
and
i
assure
you
it
is
not
at
all
my
habit
to
do
business
with
a
pistol
to
my
is
all
very
proper
dodd
there
is
no
wish
to
coerce
you
believe
me
said
fowler
please
consider
our
position
it
is
really
dangerous
we
were
not
the
only
people
to
see
your
schooner
off
fowler
i
replied
was
not
born
yesterday
will
you
allow
me
to
express
an
opinion
in
which
i
may
be
quite
wrong
but
to
which
i
am
entirely
wedded
if
the
officers
had
been
coming
they
would
have
been
here
now
in
other
words
somebody
is
working
the
oracle
and
for
a
good
guess
his
name
is
both
men
laughed
loud
and
long
and
being
supplied
with
another
bottle
of
longhurst
champagne
suffered
the
captain
and
myself
to
leave
them
without
further
word
i
gave
nares
the
correspondence
and
he
skimmed
it
through
captain
said
i
want
a
fresh
mind
on
this
what
does
it
mean
large
enough
text
replied
the
captain
means
you
to
stake
your
pile
on
speedy
hand
him
over
all
you
can
and
hold
your
tongue
i
almost
wish
you
had
shown
it
me
he
added
wearily
with
the
specie
from
the
wreck
and
the
opium
money
it
comes
to
a
biggish
supposing
that
i
do
it
said
i
said
he
you
do
there
are
pros
and
cons
to
that
i
observed
san
quentin
to
start
in
with
said
the
captain
suppose
you
clear
the
penitentiary
there
the
nasty
taste
in
the
mouth
the
figure
big
enough
to
make
bad
trouble
but
it
not
big
enough
to
be
picturesque
and
i
should
guess
a
man
always
feels
kind
of
small
who
has
sold
himself
under
six
cyphers
that
would
be
my
way
at
least
an
excitement
about
a
million
that
might
carry
me
on
but
the
other
way
i
should
feel
kind
of
lonely
when
i
woke
in
bed
then
there
speedy
do
you
know
him
well
i
do
not
said
i
of
course
he
can
vamoose
with
the
entire
speculation
if
he
chooses
pursued
the
captain
if
he
do
i
ca
see
but
what
you
got
to
support
and
bed
and
board
with
him
to
the
end
of
time
i
guess
it
would
weary
me
then
there
pinkerton
of
course
been
a
good
friend
to
you
has
he
stood
by
you
and
all
that
and
pulled
you
through
for
all
he
was
worth
he
has
i
cried
could
never
begin
telling
you
my
debt
to
him
and
that
a
consideration
said
the
captain
a
matter
of
principle
i
would
look
at
this
business
at
the
money
good
enough
would
be
my
word
but
even
principle
goes
under
when
it
comes
to
friends
the
right
sort
i
mean
this
pinkerton
is
frightened
and
he
seems
sick
the
medico
do
seem
to
care
a
cent
about
his
state
of
health
and
you
got
to
figure
how
you
would
like
it
if
he
came
to
die
remember
the
risk
of
this
little
swindle
is
all
yours
it
no
sort
of
risk
to
pinkerton
well
you
got
to
put
it
that
way
plainly
and
see
how
you
like
the
sound
of
it
my
friend
pinkerton
is
in
danger
of
the
new
jerusalem
i
am
in
danger
of
san
quentin
which
risk
do
i
propose
to
run
an
ugly
way
to
put
it
i
objected
perhaps
hardly
fair
there
right
and
wrong
to
be
know
the
parties
replied
nares
i
coming
to
them
anyway
for
it
strikes
me
when
it
came
to
smuggling
opium
you
walked
right
up
i
did
i
said
i
am
to
have
to
say
it
the
same
continued
nares
went
into
the
with
your
head
down
and
a
good
deal
of
fussing
i
listened
to
that
you
had
more
of
it
to
smuggle
now
maybe
your
partner
not
quite
fixed
the
same
as
you
are
maybe
he
sees
precious
little
difference
between
the
one
thing
and
the
could
not
say
truer
he
sees
none
i
do
believe
cried
i
though
i
see
one
i
could
never
tell
you
never
can
said
the
oracular
nares
is
all
a
matter
of
opinion
but
the
point
is
how
will
your
friend
take
it
you
refuse
a
favour
and
you
take
the
high
horse
at
the
same
time
you
disappoint
him
and
you
rap
him
over
the
knuckles
it
wo
do
dodd
no
friendship
can
stand
that
you
must
be
as
good
as
your
friend
or
as
bad
as
your
friend
or
start
on
a
fresh
deal
without
do
see
it
said
i
do
know
jim
you
will
see
said
nares
now
here
another
point
this
bit
of
money
looks
mighty
big
to
pinkerton
it
may
spell
life
or
health
to
him
but
among
all
your
creditors
i
do
see
that
it
amounts
to
a
hill
of
beans
i
do
believe
it
pay
their
all
round
and
do
you
think
you
ever
get
thanked
you
were
known
to
pay
a
long
price
for
the
chance
of
rummaging
that
wreck
you
do
the
rummaging
you
come
home
and
you
hand
over
ten
thousand
or
twenty
if
you
like
a
part
of
which
you
have
to
own
up
you
made
by
smuggling
and
mind
you
never
get
billy
fowler
to
stick
his
name
to
a
receipt
now
just
glance
at
the
transaction
from
the
outside
and
see
what
a
clear
case
it
makes
your
ten
thousand
is
a
sop
and
people
will
only
wonder
you
were
so
damned
impudent
as
to
offer
such
a
small
one
whichever
way
you
take
it
dodd
the
bottom
out
of
your
character
so
there
one
thing
less
to
be
daresay
you
scarce
believe
me
said
i
i
feel
that
a
positive
must
be
made
some
way
different
from
me
then
returned
nares
talking
about
me
i
might
just
mention
how
i
stand
you
have
no
trouble
from
me
you
trouble
enough
of
your
own
and
i
friend
enough
when
a
friend
in
need
to
shut
my
eyes
and
go
right
where
he
tells
me
all
the
same
i
rather
queerly
fixed
my
owners
have
to
rank
with
the
rest
on
their
here
am
i
their
representative
and
i
have
to
look
over
the
ship
side
while
the
bankrupt
walks
his
assets
ashore
in
mr
speedy
it
a
thing
i
would
do
for
james
blaine
but
i
do
it
for
you
dodd
and
only
sorry
i
ca
do
you
captain
my
mind
is
made
up
said
i
go
straight
ruat
coelum
i
never
understood
that
old
tag
before
hope
it
is
my
business
that
decides
you
asked
the
captain
never
deny
it
was
an
element
said
i
hope
i
hope
i
not
cowardly
i
hope
i
could
steal
for
jim
myself
but
when
it
comes
to
dragging
in
you
and
speedy
and
this
one
and
the
other
why
jim
has
got
to
die
and
there
an
end
i
try
and
work
for
him
when
i
get
to
i
suppose
and
i
suppose
i
fail
and
look
on
at
his
death
and
kick
myself
it
ca
be
helped
i
fight
it
on
this
do
say
as
you
wrong
replied
nares
i
be
hanged
if
i
know
if
you
right
it
suits
me
anyway
and
look
here
had
you
better
just
show
our
friends
over
the
side
he
added
good
of
being
at
the
risk
and
worry
of
smuggling
for
the
benefit
of
do
think
of
the
creditors
said
i
i
kept
this
pair
so
long
i
have
got
the
brass
to
fire
them
indeed
i
believe
that
was
my
only
reason
for
entering
upon
a
transaction
which
was
now
outside
my
interest
but
which
as
it
chanced
repaid
me
in
entertainment
fowler
and
sharpe
were
both
preternaturally
sharp
they
did
me
the
honour
in
the
beginning
to
attribute
to
myself
their
proper
vices
and
before
we
were
done
had
grown
to
regard
me
with
an
esteem
akin
to
worship
this
proud
position
i
attained
by
no
more
recondite
arts
than
telling
the
mere
truth
and
unaffectedly
displaying
my
indifference
to
the
result
i
have
doubtless
stated
the
essentials
of
all
good
diplomacy
which
may
be
rather
regarded
therefore
as
a
grace
of
state
than
the
effect
of
management
for
to
tell
the
truth
is
not
in
itself
diplomatic
and
to
have
no
care
for
the
result
a
thing
involuntary
when
i
mentioned
for
instance
that
i
had
but
two
hundred
and
forty
pounds
of
drug
my
smugglers
exchanged
meaning
glances
as
who
should
say
is
a
foeman
worthy
of
our
steel
but
when
i
carelessly
proposed
dollars
a
pound
as
an
amendment
to
their
offered
twenty
and
wound
up
with
the
remark
whole
thing
is
a
matter
of
moonshine
to
me
gentlemen
take
it
or
want
it
and
fill
your
i
had
the
indescribable
gratification
to
see
sharpe
nudge
fowler
warningly
and
fowler
choke
down
the
jovial
acceptance
that
stood
ready
on
his
lips
and
lamely
substitute
a
no
more
wine
please
dodd
nor
was
this
all
for
when
the
affair
was
settled
at
fifty
dollars
a
pound
a
shrewd
stroke
of
business
for
my
creditors
and
our
friends
had
got
on
board
their
whaleboat
and
shoved
off
it
appeared
they
were
imperfectly
acquainted
with
the
conveyance
of
sound
upon
still
water
and
i
had
the
joy
to
overhear
the
following
testimonial
man
that
dodd
said
sharpe
and
the
fowler
echoed
if
i
understand
his
thus
we
were
left
once
more
alone
upon
the
norah
creina
and
the
news
of
the
night
and
the
lamentations
of
pinkerton
and
the
thought
of
my
own
harsh
decision
returned
and
besieged
me
in
the
dark
according
to
all
the
rubbish
i
had
read
i
should
have
been
sustained
by
the
warm
consciousness
of
virtue
alas
i
had
but
the
one
feeling
that
i
had
sacrificed
my
sick
friend
to
the
fear
of
and
stupid
starers
and
no
moralist
has
yet
advanced
so
far
as
to
number
cowardice
amongst
the
things
that
are
their
own
reward
chapter
xvii
light
from
the
man
of
war
in
the
early
sunlight
of
the
next
day
we
tossed
close
off
the
buoy
and
saw
the
city
sparkle
in
its
groves
about
the
foot
of
the
and
the
masts
clustering
thick
in
the
small
harbour
a
good
breeze
which
had
risen
with
the
sea
carried
us
triumphantly
through
the
intricacies
of
the
passage
and
we
had
soon
brought
up
not
far
from
the
i
remember
to
have
remarked
an
ugly
horned
reptile
of
a
modern
warship
in
the
usual
moorings
across
the
port
but
my
mind
was
so
profoundly
plunged
in
melancholy
that
i
paid
no
heed
indeed
i
had
little
time
at
my
disposal
messieurs
sharpe
and
fowler
had
left
the
night
before
in
the
persuasion
that
i
was
a
liar
of
the
first
magnitude
the
genial
belief
brought
them
aboard
again
with
the
earliest
opportunity
proffering
help
to
one
who
had
proved
how
little
he
required
it
and
hospitality
to
so
respectable
a
character
i
had
business
to
mind
i
had
some
need
both
of
assistance
and
diversion
i
liked
fowler
i
do
know
why
and
in
short
i
let
them
do
with
me
as
they
desired
no
creditor
intervening
i
spent
the
first
half
of
the
day
inquiring
into
the
conditions
of
the
tea
and
silk
market
under
the
auspices
of
sharpe
lunched
with
him
in
a
private
apartment
at
the
hawaiian
hotel
for
sharpe
was
a
teetotaler
in
public
and
about
four
in
the
afternoon
was
delivered
into
the
hands
of
fowler
this
gentleman
owned
a
bungalow
on
the
waikiki
beach
and
there
in
company
with
certain
young
bloods
of
honolulu
i
was
entertained
to
a
indiscriminate
cocktails
a
dinner
a
and
to
round
off
the
night
poker
and
assorted
liquors
to
lose
money
in
the
small
hours
to
pale
intoxicated
youth
has
always
appeared
to
me
a
pleasure
overrated
in
my
then
frame
of
mind
i
confess
i
found
it
even
delightful
put
up
my
money
or
rather
my
creditors
and
put
down
fowler
champagne
with
equal
avidity
and
success
and
awoke
the
next
morning
to
a
mild
headache
and
the
rather
agreeable
lees
of
the
last
night
excitement
the
young
bloods
many
of
whom
were
still
far
from
sober
had
taken
the
kitchen
into
their
own
hands
vice
the
chinaman
deposed
and
since
each
was
engaged
upon
a
dish
of
his
own
and
none
had
the
least
scruple
in
demolishing
his
neighbour
handiwork
i
became
early
convinced
that
many
eggs
would
be
broken
and
few
omelets
made
the
discovery
of
a
jug
of
milk
and
a
crust
of
bread
enabled
me
to
stay
my
appetite
and
since
it
was
sunday
when
no
business
could
be
done
and
the
festivities
were
to
be
renewed
that
night
in
the
abode
of
fowler
it
occurred
to
me
to
slip
silently
away
and
enjoy
some
air
and
solitude
i
turned
seaward
under
the
dead
crater
known
as
diamond
head
my
way
was
for
some
time
under
the
shade
of
certain
thickets
of
green
thorny
trees
dotted
with
houses
here
i
enjoyed
some
pictures
of
the
native
life
naked
children
mingled
with
pigs
a
youth
asleep
under
a
tree
an
old
gentleman
spelling
through
glasses
his
hawaiian
bible
the
somewhat
embarrassing
spectacle
of
a
lady
at
her
bath
in
a
spring
and
the
glimpse
of
gowns
in
the
deep
shade
of
the
houses
thence
i
found
a
road
along
the
beach
itself
wading
in
sand
opposed
and
buffeted
by
the
whole
weight
of
the
trade
on
one
hand
the
glittering
and
sounding
surf
and
the
bay
lively
with
many
sails
on
the
other
precipitous
arid
gullies
and
sheer
cliffs
mounting
towards
the
crater
and
the
blue
sky
for
all
the
companionship
of
skimming
vessels
the
place
struck
me
with
a
sense
of
solitude
there
came
in
my
head
what
i
had
been
told
the
day
before
at
dinner
of
a
cavern
above
in
the
bowels
of
the
volcano
a
place
only
to
be
visited
with
the
light
of
torches
a
of
the
bones
of
priests
and
warriors
and
clamorous
with
the
voice
of
an
unseen
river
pouring
seaward
through
the
crannies
of
the
mountain
at
the
thought
it
was
revealed
to
me
suddenly
how
the
bungalows
and
the
fowlers
and
the
bright
busy
town
and
crowding
ships
were
all
children
of
yesterday
and
for
centuries
before
the
obscure
life
of
the
natives
with
its
glories
and
ambitions
its
joys
and
crimes
and
agonies
had
rolled
unseen
like
the
mountain
river
in
that
place
not
chaldea
appeared
more
ancient
nor
the
pyramids
of
egypt
more
abstruse
and
i
heard
time
measured
by
drums
and
of
immemorial
conquests
and
saw
myself
the
creature
of
an
hour
over
the
bankruptcy
of
pinkerton
and
dodd
of
montana
block
and
the
conscientious
troubles
of
the
junior
partner
the
spirit
of
eternity
was
seen
to
smile
to
this
mood
of
philosophic
sadness
my
excesses
of
the
night
before
no
doubt
contributed
for
more
things
than
virtue
are
at
times
their
own
reward
but
i
was
greatly
healed
at
least
of
my
distresses
and
while
i
was
yet
enjoying
my
abstracted
humour
a
turn
of
the
beach
brought
me
in
view
of
the
with
its
and
perched
on
the
immediate
margin
of
a
cliff
the
house
was
new
and
clean
and
bald
and
stood
naked
to
the
trades
the
wind
beat
about
it
in
loud
squalls
the
seaward
windows
rattled
without
mercy
the
breach
of
the
surf
below
contributed
its
increment
of
noise
and
the
fall
of
my
foot
in
the
narrow
verandah
passed
unheard
by
those
within
there
were
two
on
whom
i
thus
entered
unexpectedly
the
man
with
grizzled
beard
keen
seaman
eyes
and
that
brand
on
his
countenance
that
comes
of
solitary
living
and
a
visitor
an
oldish
oratorical
fellow
in
the
smart
tropical
array
of
the
british
man
perched
on
a
table
and
smoking
a
cigar
i
was
made
pleasantly
welcome
and
was
soon
listening
with
amusement
to
the
if
i
had
have
been
born
an
englishman
was
one
of
his
sentiments
me
i
rather
been
born
a
frenchy
i
like
to
see
another
nation
fit
to
black
their
presently
after
he
developed
his
views
on
home
politics
with
similar
trenchancy
rather
be
a
brute
beast
than
what
i
be
a
liberal
he
said
banners
and
that
a
pig
got
more
sense
why
look
at
our
chief
engineer
they
do
say
he
carried
a
banner
with
his
own
for
gladstone
i
suppose
or
with
the
aristocracy
what
does
the
aristocracy
do
show
me
a
country
any
good
without
one
not
the
states
why
the
of
corruption
i
knew
a
man
he
was
a
good
man
born
who
was
signal
quartermaster
in
the
wyandotte
he
told
me
he
could
never
have
got
there
if
he
had
have
with
the
boys
told
it
me
as
telling
you
now
we
all
british
subjects
here
he
was
going
on
am
afraid
i
am
an
american
i
said
apologetically
he
seemed
the
least
bit
taken
aback
but
recovered
himself
and
with
the
ready
tact
of
his
betters
paid
me
the
usual
british
compliment
on
the
riposte
do
say
so
he
exclaimed
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
i
never
have
guessed
it
nobody
could
tell
it
on
you
said
he
as
though
it
were
some
form
of
liquor
i
thanked
him
as
i
always
do
at
this
particular
stage
with
his
compatriots
not
so
much
perhaps
for
the
compliment
to
myself
and
my
poor
country
as
for
the
revelation
which
is
ever
fresh
to
me
of
britannic
and
taste
and
he
was
so
far
softened
by
my
gratitude
as
to
add
a
word
of
praise
on
the
american
method
of
lacing
sails
ahead
of
us
in
lacing
sails
he
said
can
say
that
with
a
clear
you
i
replied
shall
certainly
do
at
this
rate
we
got
along
swimmingly
and
when
i
rose
to
retrace
my
steps
to
the
fowlery
he
at
once
started
to
his
feet
and
offered
me
the
welcome
solace
of
his
company
for
the
return
i
believe
i
discovered
much
alacrity
at
the
idea
for
the
creature
who
seemed
to
be
unique
or
to
represent
a
type
like
that
of
the
dodo
entertained
me
hugely
but
when
he
had
produced
his
hat
i
found
i
was
in
the
way
of
more
than
entertainment
for
on
the
ribbon
i
could
read
the
legend
say
i
began
when
our
adieus
were
paid
and
we
were
scrambling
down
the
path
from
the
was
your
ship
that
picked
up
the
men
on
board
the
flying
scud
was
it
may
say
so
said
he
a
blessed
good
job
for
the
it
a
spot
that
midway
just
come
from
there
said
i
was
i
who
bought
the
your
pardon
sir
cried
the
sailor
in
the
white
schooner
same
said
i
my
friend
saluted
as
though
we
were
now
for
the
first
time
formally
introduced
course
i
continued
am
rather
taken
up
with
the
whole
story
and
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
you
can
of
how
the
men
were
was
like
this
said
he
had
orders
to
call
at
midway
after
castaways
and
had
our
distance
pretty
nigh
run
down
the
day
before
we
steamed
all
night
looking
to
make
it
about
noon
for
old
tootles
beg
your
pardon
sir
the
captain
was
precious
scared
of
the
place
at
night
well
there
nasty
filthy
currents
round
that
midway
you
know
as
has
been
there
and
one
on
must
have
set
us
down
leastways
about
six
bells
when
we
had
ought
to
been
miles
away
some
one
sees
a
sail
and
lo
and
there
was
the
spars
of
a
brig
we
raised
her
pretty
fast
and
the
island
after
her
and
made
out
she
was
hard
aground
canted
on
her
bilge
and
had
her
flying
union
down
it
was
breaking
on
the
reef
and
we
laid
well
out
and
sent
a
couple
of
boats
i
did
go
in
neither
only
stood
and
looked
on
but
it
seems
they
was
all
badly
scared
and
muddled
and
did
know
which
end
was
uppermost
one
on
kep
snivelling
and
wringing
of
his
he
come
on
board
all
of
a
sop
like
a
monthly
nurse
that
trent
he
come
first
with
his
in
a
bloody
rag
i
was
near
as
i
am
to
you
and
i
could
make
out
he
was
all
to
bits
his
breath
rattle
in
his
blooming
lungs
as
he
come
down
the
ladder
yes
they
was
a
scared
lot
small
blame
to
i
say
the
next
after
trent
come
him
as
was
i
exclaimed
a
good
name
for
him
too
chuckled
the
man
who
probably
confounded
the
word
with
a
familiar
oath
good
name
too
only
it
were
his
he
was
a
born
sir
as
had
gone
maskewerading
one
of
our
officers
knowed
him
at
reckonises
him
steps
up
out
his
right
off
and
says
he
ullo
norrie
old
chappie
he
says
the
other
was
coming
up
as
bold
as
look
at
it
did
seem
put
out
that
where
blood
tells
sir
well
no
sooner
does
he
his
born
name
given
him
than
he
turns
as
white
as
the
day
of
judgment
stares
at
sebright
like
he
was
looking
at
a
ghost
and
then
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
turned
to
and
doubled
up
in
a
dead
faint
him
down
to
my
berth

of
a
gentleman

me
he
was
come
of
the
best
blood
in
england
was
my
friend
reply
and
bred
and
might
have
been
a
but
to
look
at
i
corrected
him
same
as
you
or
me
was
the
uncompromising
answer
much
to
look
at
i
did
know
he
was
a
but
then
i
never
see
him
cleaned
was
that
i
cried
yes
i
remember
he
was
sick
all
the
way
to
was
he
not
or
sorry
or
something
returned
my
informant
belief
he
did
hanker
after
showing
up
he
kep
close
the
steward
what
took
his
meals
in
told
me
he
ate
nex
to
nothing
and
he
was
fetched
ashore
at
on
the
quiet
here
was
how
it
was
it
seems
his
brother
had
took
and
died
him
as
had
the
estate
this
one
had
gone
in
for
his
beer
by
what
i
could
make
out
the
old
folks
at
had
turned
rusty
no
one
knew
where
he
had
gone
to
here
he
was
slaving
in
a
merchant
brig
shipwrecked
on
midway
and
packing
up
his
duds
for
a
long
voyage
in
a
open
boat
he
comes
on
board
our
ship
and
by
god
here
he
is
a
landed
proprietor
and
may
be
in
parliament
it
no
less
than
natural
he
should
keep
dark
so
would
you
and
me
in
the
same
daresay
said
i
you
saw
more
of
the
others
be
sure
says
he
in
them
from
what
i
see
there
was
one
there
colonial
born
he
was
and
had
been
through
a
power
of
money
there
was
no
nonsense
about
he
had
been
up
and
he
had
come
down
and
took
it
so
his
was
in
the
right
place
and
he
was
and
knew
french
and
latin
i
believe
like
a
native
i
liked
that
he
was
a
boy
they
say
much
about
the
wreck
i
asked
was
much
to
say
i
reckon
replied
the
man
was
all
in
the
papers
used
to
yarn
most
about
the
coins
he
had
gone
through
he
had
lived
with
and
jockeys
and
pugs
and
actors
and
all
that
a
precious
low
lot
added
this
judicious
person
it
about
here
my
is
moored
and
by
your
leave
i
be
getting
moment
said
i
sebright
on
board
sir
he
ashore
said
the
sailor
took
up
a
bag
for
him
to
the
with
that
we
parted
presently
after
my
friend
overtook
and
passed
me
on
a
hired
steed
which
seemed
to
scorn
its
cavalier
and
i
was
left
in
the
dust
of
his
passage
a
prey
to
whirling
thoughts
for
i
now
stood
or
seemed
to
stand
on
the
immediate
threshold
of
these
mysteries
i
knew
the
name
of
the
man
dickson
his
name
was
carthew
i
knew
where
the
money
came
from
that
opposed
us
at
the
sale
it
was
part
of
inheritance
and
in
my
gallery
of
illustrations
to
the
history
of
the
wreck
one
more
picture
hung
perhaps
the
most
dramatic
of
the
series
it
showed
me
the
deck
of
a
warship
in
that
distant
part
of
the
great
ocean
the
officers
and
seamen
looking
curiously
on
and
a
man
of
birth
and
education
who
had
been
sailing
under
an
alias
on
a
trading
brig
and
was
now
rescued
from
desperate
peril
felled
like
an
ox
by
the
bare
sound
of
his
own
name
i
could
not
fail
to
be
reminded
of
my
own
experience
at
the
occidental
telephone
the
hero
of
three
styles
dickson
goddedaal
or
carthew
must
be
the
owner
of
a
lively
or
a
loaded
conscience
and
the
reflection
recalled
to
me
the
photograph
found
on
board
the
flying
scud
just
such
a
man
i
reasoned
would
be
capable
of
just
such
starts
and
crises
and
i
inclined
to
think
that
goddedaal
or
carthew
was
the
mainspring
of
the
mystery
one
thing
was
plain
as
long
as
the
tempest
was
in
reach
i
must
make
the
acquaintance
of
both
sebright
and
the
doctor
to
this
end
i
excused
myself
with
fowler
returned
to
honolulu
and
passed
the
remainder
of
the
day
hanging
vainly
round
the
cool
verandahs
of
the
hotel
it
was
near
nine
at
night
before
i
was
rewarded
is
the
gentleman
you
were
asking
for
said
the
clerk
i
beheld
a
man
in
tweeds
of
an
incomparable
languor
of
demeanour
and
carrying
a
cane
with
genteel
effort
from
the
name
i
had
looked
to
find
a
sort
of
viking
and
young
ruler
of
the
battle
and
the
tempest
and
i
was
the
more
disappointed
and
not
a
little
alarmed
to
come
face
to
face
with
this
impracticable
type
believe
i
have
the
pleasure
of
addressing
lieutenant
sebright
said
i
stepping
forward
yes
replied
the
hero
aw
i
daw
knaw
you
do
i
he
spoke
for
all
the
world
like
lord
foppington
in
the
old
play
a
proof
of
the
perennial
nature
of
man
affectations
but
his
limping
dialect
i
scorn
to
continue
to
reproduce
was
with
the
intention
of
making
myself
known
that
i
have
taken
this
step
said
i
entirely
unabashed
for
impudence
begets
in
me
its
like
perhaps
my
only
martial
attribute
have
a
common
subject
of
interest
to
me
very
lively
and
i
believe
i
may
be
in
a
position
to
be
of
some
service
to
a
friend
of
yours
to
give
him
at
least
some
very
welcome
the
last
clause
was
a
sop
to
my
conscience
i
could
not
pretend
even
to
myself
either
the
power
or
the
will
to
serve
carthew
but
i
felt
sure
he
would
like
to
hear
the
flying
scud
was
burned
do
know
i
i
do
understand
you
stammered
my
victim
have
any
friends
in
honolulu
do
you
know
friend
to
whom
i
refer
is
english
i
replied
is
carthew
whom
you
picked
up
at
midway
my
firm
has
bought
the
wreck
i
am
just
returned
from
breaking
her
up
and
to
make
my
business
quite
clear
to
you
i
have
a
communication
it
is
necessary
i
should
make
and
have
to
trouble
you
for
carthew
it
will
be
seen
how
rapidly
i
had
dropped
all
hope
of
interesting
the
frigid
british
bear
he
on
his
side
was
plainly
on
thorns
at
my
insistence
i
judged
he
was
suffering
torments
of
alarm
lest
i
should
prove
an
undesirable
acquaintance
diagnosed
him
for
a
shy
dull
vain
unamiable
animal
without
adequate
defence
a
sort
of
dishoused
snail
and
concluded
rightly
enough
that
he
would
consent
to
anything
to
bring
our
interview
to
a
conclusion
a
moment
later
he
had
fled
leaving
me
with
a
sheet
of
paper
thus
inscribed
norris
carthew
dorset
i
might
have
cried
victory
the
field
of
battle
and
some
of
the
baggage
remaining
in
my
occupation
as
a
matter
of
fact
my
moral
sufferings
during
the
engagement
had
rivalled
those
of
sebright
i
was
left
incapable
of
fresh
hostilities
i
owned
that
the
navy
of
old
england
was
for
me
invincible
as
of
yore
and
giving
up
all
thought
of
the
doctor
inclined
to
salute
her
veteran
flag
in
the
future
from
a
prudent
distance
such
was
my
inclination
when
i
retired
to
rest
and
my
first
experience
the
next
morning
strengthened
it
to
certainty
for
i
had
the
pleasure
of
encountering
my
fair
antagonist
on
his
way
on
board
and
he
honoured
me
with
a
recognition
so
disgustingly
dry
that
my
impatience
overflowed
and
recalling
the
tactics
of
nelson
i
neglected
to
perceive
or
to
return
it
judge
of
my
astonishment
some
later
to
receive
a
note
of
invitation
from
the
tempest
sir
it
began
are
all
naturally
very
much
interested
in
the
wreck
of
the
flying
scud
and
as
soon
as
i
mentioned
that
i
had
the
pleasure
of
making
your
acquaintance
a
very
general
wish
was
expressed
that
you
would
come
and
dine
on
board
it
will
give
us
all
the
greatest
pleasure
to
see
you
or
in
case
you
should
be
otherwise
engaged
to
luncheon
either
or
a
note
of
the
hours
followed
and
the
document
wound
up
with
the
name
of
lascelles
sebright
under
an
undeniable
statement
that
he
was
sincerely
mine
lascelles
sebright
i
reflected
are
not
but
i
begin
to
suspect
that
like
the
lady
in
the
song
you
are
another
you
have
mentioned
your
adventure
my
friend
you
have
been
blown
up
you
have
got
your
orders
this
note
has
been
dictated
and
i
am
asked
on
board
in
spite
of
your
melancholy
protests
not
to
meet
the
men
and
not
to
talk
about
the
flying
scud
but
to
undergo
the
scrutiny
of
some
one
interested
in
carthew
the
doctor
for
a
wager
and
for
a
second
wager
all
this
springs
from
your
facility
in
giving
the
i
lost
no
time
in
answering
the
billet
electing
for
the
earliest
occasion
and
at
the
appointed
hour
a
somewhat
boat
crew
from
the
norah
creina
conveyed
me
under
the
guns
of
the
tempest
the
appeared
pleased
to
see
me
sebright
brother
officers
in
contrast
to
himself
took
a
boyish
interest
in
my
cruise
and
much
was
talked
of
the
flying
scud
of
how
she
had
been
lost
of
how
i
had
found
her
and
of
the
weather
the
anchorage
and
the
currents
about
midway
island
carthew
was
referred
to
more
than
once
without
embarrassment
the
parallel
case
of
a
late
earl
of
aberdeen
who
died
mate
on
board
a
yankee
schooner
was
adduced
if
they
told
me
little
of
the
man
it
was
because
they
had
not
much
to
tell
and
only
felt
an
interest
in
his
recognition
and
pity
for
his
prolonged
i
could
never
think
the
subject
was
avoided
and
it
was
clear
that
the
officers
far
from
practising
concealment
had
nothing
to
conceal
so
far
then
all
seemed
natural
and
yet
the
doctor
troubled
me
this
was
a
tall
rugged
plain
man
on
the
wrong
side
of
fifty
already
gray
and
with
a
restless
mouth
and
bushy
eyebrows
he
spoke
seldom
but
then
with
gaiety
and
his
great
quaking
silent
laughter
was
infectious
i
could
make
out
that
he
was
at
once
the
quiz
of
the
and
perfectly
respected
and
i
made
sure
that
he
observed
me
covertly
it
is
certain
i
returned
the
compliment
if
carthew
had
feigned
sickness
and
all
seemed
to
point
in
that
direction
here
was
the
man
who
knew
all
or
certainly
knew
much
his
strong
sterling
face
progressively
and
silently
persuaded
of
his
full
knowledge
that
was
not
the
mouth
these
were
not
the
eyes
of
one
who
would
act
in
ignorance
or
could
be
led
at
random
nor
again
was
it
the
face
of
a
man
squeamish
in
the
case
of
malefactors
there
was
even
a
touch
of
brutus
there
and
something
of
the
hanging
judge
in
short
he
seemed
the
last
character
for
the
part
assigned
him
in
my
theories
and
wonder
and
curiosity
contended
in
my
mind
luncheon
was
over
and
an
adjournment
to
the
proposed
when
upon
a
sudden
impulse
i
burned
my
ships
and
pleading
indisposition
requested
to
consult
the
doctor
is
nothing
the
matter
with
my
body
urquart
said
i
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
he
hummed
his
mouth
worked
he
regarded
me
steadily
with
his
gray
eyes
but
resolutely
held
his
peace
want
to
talk
to
you
about
the
flying
scud
and
carthew
i
resumed
you
must
have
expected
this
i
am
sure
you
know
all
you
are
shrewd
and
must
have
a
guess
that
i
know
much
how
are
we
to
stand
to
one
another
and
how
am
i
to
stand
to
carthew
do
not
fully
understand
you
he
replied
after
a
pause
and
then
after
another
is
the
spirit
i
refer
to
spirit
of
my
inquiries
i
asked
he
nodded
think
we
are
at
said
i
spirit
is
precisely
what
i
came
in
quest
of
i
bought
the
flying
scud
at
a
ruinous
figure
run
up
by
carthew
through
an
agent
and
i
am
in
consequence
a
bankrupt
but
if
i
have
found
no
fortune
in
the
wreck
i
have
found
unmistakable
evidences
of
foul
play
conceive
my
position
i
am
ruined
through
this
man
whom
i
never
saw
i
might
very
well
desire
revenge
or
compensation
and
i
think
you
will
admit
i
have
the
means
to
extort
he
made
no
sign
in
answer
to
this
challenge
you
not
understand
then
i
resumed
spirit
in
which
i
come
to
one
who
is
surely
in
the
secret
and
ask
him
honestly
and
plainly
how
do
i
stand
to
carthew
must
ask
you
to
be
more
explicit
said
he
do
not
help
me
much
i
retorted
see
if
you
can
understand
my
conscience
is
not
very
still
i
have
one
now
there
are
degrees
of
foul
play
to
some
of
which
i
have
no
particular
objection
i
am
sure
with
carthew
i
am
not
at
all
the
person
to
forgo
an
advantage
and
i
have
much
curiosity
but
on
the
other
hand
i
have
no
taste
for
persecution
and
i
ask
you
to
believe
that
i
am
not
the
man
to
make
bad
worse
or
heap
trouble
on
the
i
think
i
understand
said
he
i
pass
you
my
word
that
whatever
may
have
occurred
there
were
excuses
great
excuses
i
may
say
very
great
would
have
weight
with
me
doctor
i
replied
may
go
further
he
pursued
i
had
been
there
or
you
had
been
there
after
a
certain
event
had
taken
place
it
a
grave
question
what
we
might
have
done
it
even
a
question
what
we
could
have
done
ourselves
or
take
me
i
will
be
plain
with
you
and
own
that
i
am
in
possession
of
the
facts
you
have
a
shrewd
guess
how
i
have
acted
in
that
knowledge
may
i
ask
you
to
judge
from
the
character
of
my
action
something
of
the
nature
of
that
knowledge
which
i
have
no
call
nor
yet
no
title
to
share
with
you
i
can
not
convey
a
sense
of
the
rugged
conviction
and
judicial
emphasis
of
urquart
speech
to
those
who
did
not
hear
him
it
may
appear
as
if
he
fed
me
on
enigmas
to
myself
who
heard
i
seemed
to
have
received
a
lesson
and
a
compliment
thank
you
i
said
feel
you
have
said
as
much
as
possible
and
more
than
i
had
any
right
to
ask
i
take
that
as
a
mark
of
confidence
which
i
will
try
to
deserve
i
hope
sir
you
will
let
me
regard
you
as
a
he
evaded
my
proffered
friendship
with
a
blunt
proposal
to
rejoin
the
mess
and
yet
a
moment
later
contrived
to
alleviate
the
snub
for
as
we
entered
the
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
with
a
kind
familiarity
have
just
prescribed
for
dodd
says
he
glass
of
our
i
have
never
again
met
urquart
but
he
wrote
himself
so
clear
upon
my
memory
that
i
think
i
see
him
still
and
indeed
i
had
cause
to
remember
the
man
for
the
sake
of
his
communication
it
was
hard
enough
to
make
a
theory
fit
the
circumstances
of
the
flying
scud
but
one
in
which
the
chief
actor
should
stand
the
least
excused
and
might
retain
the
esteem
or
at
least
the
pity
of
a
man
like
urquart
failed
me
utterly
here
at
least
was
the
end
of
my
discoveries
i
learned
no
more
till
i
learned
all
and
my
reader
has
the
evidence
complete
is
he
more
astute
than
i
was
or
like
me
does
he
give
it
up
chapter
xviii
and
crooked
answers
i
have
said
hard
words
of
san
francisco
they
must
scarce
be
literally
understood
one
can
not
suppose
the
israelites
did
justice
to
the
land
of
pharaoh
and
the
city
took
a
fine
revenge
of
me
on
my
return
she
had
never
worn
a
more
becoming
guise
the
sun
shone
the
air
was
lively
the
people
had
flowers
in
their
and
smiles
upon
their
faces
and
as
i
made
my
way
towards
jim
place
of
employment
with
some
very
black
anxieties
at
heart
i
seemed
to
myself
a
blot
on
the
surrounding
gaiety
my
destination
was
in
a
in
a
mean
rickety
building
franklin
dodge
steam
printing
appeared
upon
its
front
and
in
characters
of
greater
freshness
so
as
to
suggest
recent
conversion
the
labour
in
the
office
in
a
dusty
pen
jim
sat
alone
before
a
table
a
wretched
change
had
overtaken
him
in
clothes
body
and
bearing
he
looked
sick
and
shabby
he
who
had
once
rejoiced
in
his
day
employment
like
a
horse
among
pastures
now
sat
staring
on
a
column
of
accounts
idly
chewing
a
pen
at
times
heavily
sighing
the
picture
of
inefficiency
and
inattention
he
was
sunk
deep
in
a
painful
reverie
he
neither
saw
nor
heard
me
and
i
stood
and
watched
him
unobserved
i
had
a
sudden
vain
relenting
repentance
bludgeoned
me
as
i
had
predicted
to
nares
i
stood
and
kicked
myself
here
was
i
come
home
again
my
honour
saved
there
was
my
friend
in
want
of
rest
nursing
and
a
generous
diet
and
i
asked
myself
with
falstaff
is
in
that
word
honour
what
is
that
honour
and
like
falstaff
i
told
myself
that
it
was
air
said
i
he
gasped
and
jumped
from
his
chair
and
stood
shaking
the
next
moment
i
was
over
the
barrier
and
we
were
hand
in
hand
poor
old
man
i
cried
god
you
home
at
last
he
gulped
and
kept
patting
my
shoulder
with
his
hand
no
good
news
for
you
jim
said
i
come
that
the
good
news
that
i
want
he
replied
how
i
longed
for
you
loudon
could
do
what
you
wrote
me
i
said
lowering
my
voice
creditors
have
it
all
i
could
do
returned
jim
was
crazy
when
wrote
i
could
never
have
looked
mamie
in
the
face
if
we
had
done
it
o
loudon
what
a
gift
that
woman
is
you
think
you
know
something
of
life
you
just
do
know
anything
it
the
goodness
of
the
woman
it
a
revelation
all
right
said
i
how
i
hoped
to
hear
you
so
the
flying
scud
was
a
fraud
he
resumed
did
quite
understand
your
letter
but
i
made
out
is
a
mild
term
for
it
said
i
creditors
will
never
believe
what
fools
we
were
and
that
reminds
me
i
continued
rejoicing
in
the
transition
about
the
bankruptcy
were
lucky
to
be
out
of
that
answered
jim
shaking
his
head
were
lucky
not
to
see
the
papers
the
called
me
a
kerbstone
broker
with
water
on
the
brain
another
said
i
was
a
that
had
got
into
the
same
meadow
with
longhurst
and
had
blown
myself
out
till
i
went
pop
it
was
rough
on
a
man
in
his
honeymoon
so
was
what
they
said
about
my
looks
and
what
i
had
on
and
the
way
i
perspired
but
i
braced
myself
up
with
the
flying
scud
how
did
it
exactly
figure
out
anyway
i
do
seem
to
catch
on
to
that
story
devil
you
do
thinks
i
to
myself
and
then
aloud
see
we
had
neither
one
of
us
good
luck
i
did
do
much
more
than
cover
current
expenses
and
you
got
floored
immediately
how
did
we
come
to
go
so
soon
we
have
to
have
a
talk
over
all
this
said
jim
with
a
sudden
start
should
be
getting
to
my
books
and
i
guess
you
had
better
go
up
right
away
to
mamie
she
at
speedy
she
expects
you
with
impatience
she
regards
you
in
the
light
of
a
favourite
brother
any
scheme
was
welcome
which
allowed
me
to
postpone
the
hour
of
explanation
and
avoid
were
it
only
for
a
breathing
space
the
topic
of
the
flying
scud
i
hastened
accordingly
to
bush
street
mrs
speedy
already
rejoicing
in
the
return
of
a
spouse
hailed
me
with
acclamation
it
beautiful
you
looking
dodd
my
dear
she
was
kind
enough
to
say
a
miracle
they
naygur
waheenies
let
ye
lave
the
oilands
i
have
my
suspicions
of
shpeedy
she
added
roguishly
ye
see
him
after
the
naygresses
now
i
gave
speedy
an
unblemished
character
one
of
ye
will
niver
bethray
the
other
said
the
playful
dame
and
ushered
me
into
a
bare
room
where
mamie
sat
working
a
i
was
touched
by
the
cordiality
of
her
greeting
with
the
prettiest
gesture
in
the
world
she
gave
me
both
her
hands
wheeled
forth
a
chair
and
produced
from
a
cupboard
a
tin
of
my
favourite
tobacco
and
a
book
of
my
exclusive
cigarette
papers
she
cried
see
loudon
we
were
all
prepared
for
you
the
things
were
bought
the
very
day
you
i
imagined
she
had
always
intended
me
a
pleasant
welcome
but
the
certain
fervour
of
sincerity
which
i
could
not
help
remarking
flowed
from
an
unexpected
source
captain
nares
with
a
kindness
for
which
i
can
never
be
sufficiently
grateful
had
stolen
a
moment
from
his
occupations
driven
to
call
on
mamie
and
drawn
her
a
generous
picture
of
my
prowess
at
the
wreck
she
was
careful
not
to
breathe
a
word
of
this
interview
till
she
had
led
me
on
to
tell
my
adventures
for
myself
captain
nares
was
better
she
cried
when
i
had
done
your
account
i
have
only
learned
one
new
thing
that
you
are
modest
as
well
as
i
can
not
tell
with
what
sort
of
disclamation
i
sought
to
reply
is
of
no
use
said
mamie
know
a
hero
and
when
i
heard
of
you
working
all
day
like
a
common
labourer
with
your
hands
bleeding
and
your
nails
broken
and
how
you
told
the
captain
to
on
i
think
he
said
in
the
storm
when
he
was
terrified
himself
and
the
danger
of
that
horrid
nares
had
been
obligingly
dipping
his
brush
in
earthquake
and
eclipse
how
it
was
all
done
in
part
at
least
for
jim
and
me
i
felt
we
could
never
say
how
we
admired
and
thanked
i
cried
talk
of
thanks
it
is
not
a
word
to
be
used
between
friends
jim
and
i
have
been
prosperous
together
now
we
shall
be
poor
together
we
done
our
best
and
that
all
that
need
be
said
the
next
thing
is
for
me
to
find
a
situation
and
send
you
and
jim
up
country
for
a
long
holiday
in
the
redwoods
for
a
holiday
jim
has
got
to
ca
take
your
money
loudon
said
mamie
cried
i
got
to
did
i
take
his
presently
after
jim
himself
arrived
and
before
he
had
yet
done
mopping
his
brow
he
was
at
me
with
the
accursed
subject
loudon
said
he
we
are
all
together
the
day
work
done
and
the
evening
before
us
just
start
in
with
the
whole
word
on
business
first
said
i
speaking
from
the
lips
outward
and
meanwhile
in
the
private
apartments
of
my
brain
trying
for
the
thousandth
time
to
find
some
plausible
arrangement
of
my
story
want
to
have
a
notion
how
we
stand
about
the
that
ancient
history
cried
jim
paid
seven
cents
and
a
wonder
we
did
as
well
the
receiver
methought
a
spasm
seized
him
at
the
name
of
this
official
and
he
broke
off
it
all
past
and
done
with
anyway
and
what
i
want
to
get
at
is
the
facts
about
the
wreck
i
do
seem
to
understand
it
appears
to
me
like
as
there
was
something
was
nothing
in
it
anyway
i
said
with
a
forced
laugh
what
i
want
to
judge
of
returned
jim
the
mischief
is
it
i
can
never
keep
you
to
that
bankruptcy
it
looks
as
if
you
avoided
it
said
i
for
a
man
in
my
situation
with
unpardonable
folly
it
look
a
little
as
if
you
were
trying
to
avoid
the
wreck
asked
jim
it
was
my
own
doing
there
was
no
retreat
dear
fellow
if
you
make
a
point
of
it
here
goes
said
i
and
launched
with
spurious
gaiety
into
the
current
of
my
tale
i
told
it
with
point
and
spirit
described
the
island
and
the
wreck
mimicked
anderson
and
the
chinese
maintained
the
suspense
my
pen
has
stumbled
on
the
fatal
word
i
maintained
the
suspense
so
well
that
it
was
never
relieved
and
when
i
stopped
i
dare
not
say
concluded
where
there
was
no
conclusion
i
found
jim
and
mamie
regarding
me
with
surprise
said
jim
that
all
said
i
how
do
you
explain
it
he
asked
ca
explain
it
said
mamie
wagged
her
head
ominously
great
caesar
ghost
the
money
was
offered
cried
jim
do
loudon
it
nonsense
on
the
face
of
it
i
do
say
but
what
you
and
nares
did
your
best
i
sure
of
course
you
did
but
i
do
say
you
got
fooled
i
say
the
stuff
is
in
that
ship
and
i
say
i
mean
to
get
is
nothing
in
the
ship
i
tell
you
but
old
wood
and
iron
said
i
see
said
jim
time
i
go
myself
i
take
mamie
for
the
trip
longhurst
wo
refuse
me
the
expense
of
a
schooner
you
wait
till
i
get
the
searching
of
you
ca
search
her
cried
i
cried
mamie
starting
a
little
from
the
attitude
of
quiescent
capacity
in
which
she
had
hitherto
sat
to
hear
me
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
there
was
an
appreciable
pause
beg
your
pardon
loudon
began
jim
at
last
why
in
snakes
did
you
burn
her
was
an
idea
of
nares
said
i
is
certainly
the
strangest
circumstance
of
all
observed
mamie
must
say
loudon
it
does
seem
kind
of
unexpected
added
jim
seems
kind
of
crazy
even
what
did
you
what
did
nares
expect
to
gain
by
burning
her
do
know
it
did
seem
to
matter
we
had
got
all
there
was
to
get
said
i
the
very
point
cried
jim
was
quite
plain
you
made
you
so
sure
asked
mamie
can
i
tell
you
i
cried
had
been
all
through
her
we
were
sure
that
all
that
i
can
begin
to
think
you
were
she
returned
with
a
significant
emphasis
jim
hurriedly
intervened
i
do
quite
make
out
loudon
is
that
you
do
seem
to
appreciate
the
peculiarities
of
the
thing
said
he
does
seem
to
have
struck
you
same
as
it
does
why
go
on
with
this
cried
mamie
suddenly
rising
dodd
is
not
telling
us
either
what
he
thinks
or
what
he
cried
jim
need
not
be
concerned
for
his
feelings
james
he
is
not
concerned
for
yours
returned
the
lady
dare
not
deny
it
besides
and
this
is
not
the
first
time
he
has
practised
reticence
have
you
forgotten
that
he
knew
the
address
and
did
not
tell
it
you
until
that
man
had
escaped
jim
turned
to
me
pleadingly
we
were
all
on
our
feet
he
said
see
mamie
has
some
fancy
and
i
must
say
there
just
a
sort
of
a
shadow
of
an
excuse
for
it
is
bewildering
even
to
me
loudon
with
my
trained
business
intelligence
for
god
sake
clear
it
serves
me
right
said
i
should
not
have
tried
to
keep
you
in
the
dark
i
should
have
told
you
at
first
that
i
was
pledged
to
secrecy
i
should
have
asked
you
to
trust
me
in
the
beginning
it
is
all
i
can
do
now
there
is
more
of
the
story
but
it
concerns
none
of
us
and
my
tongue
is
tied
i
have
given
my
word
of
honour
you
must
trust
me
and
try
to
forgive
daresay
i
am
very
stupid
dodd
began
mamie
with
an
alarming
sweetness
i
thought
you
went
upon
this
trip
as
my
representative
and
with
my
husband
money
you
tell
us
now
that
you
are
pledged
but
i
should
have
thought
you
were
pledged
first
of
all
to
james
you
say
it
does
not
concern
us
we
are
poor
people
and
my
husband
is
sick
and
it
concerns
us
a
great
deal
to
understand
how
we
come
to
have
lost
our
money
and
why
our
representative
comes
back
to
us
with
nothing
you
ask
that
we
should
trust
you
you
do
not
seem
to
understand
the
question
we
are
asking
ourselves
is
whether
we
have
not
trusted
you
too
do
not
ask
you
to
trust
me
i
replied
ask
jim
he
knows
think
you
can
do
what
you
please
with
james
you
trust
to
his
affection
do
you
not
and
me
i
suppose
you
do
not
consider
said
mamie
it
was
perhaps
an
unfortunate
day
for
you
when
we
were
married
for
i
at
least
am
not
blind
the
crew
run
away
the
ship
is
sold
for
a
great
deal
of
money
you
know
that
man
address
and
you
conceal
it
you
do
not
find
what
you
were
sent
to
look
for
and
yet
you
burn
the
ship
and
now
when
we
ask
explanations
you
are
pledged
to
secrecy
but
i
am
pledged
to
no
such
thing
i
will
not
stand
by
in
silence
and
see
my
sick
and
ruined
husband
betrayed
by
his
condescending
friend
i
will
give
you
the
truth
for
once
dodd
you
have
been
bought
and
cried
jim
more
of
this
it
me
you
striking
it
only
me
you
hurt
you
do
know
you
can
not
understand
these
things
why
if
it
had
been
for
loudon
i
could
have
looked
you
in
the
face
he
saved
my
have
heard
plenty
of
this
talk
before
she
replied
are
a
fool
and
i
love
you
for
it
but
i
am
a
woman
my
eyes
are
open
and
i
understand
this
man
hypocrisy
did
he
not
come
here
and
pretend
he
would
take
a
situation
pretend
he
would
share
his
wages
with
us
until
you
were
well
pretend
it
makes
me
furious
his
wages
a
share
of
his
wages
that
would
have
been
your
pittance
that
would
have
been
your
share
of
the
flying
scud
you
who
worked
and
toiled
for
him
when
he
was
a
beggar
in
the
streets
of
paris
but
we
do
not
want
your
charity
thank
god
i
can
work
for
my
own
husband
see
what
it
is
to
have
obliged
a
gentleman
he
would
let
you
pick
him
up
when
he
was
begging
he
would
stand
and
look
on
and
let
you
black
his
shoes
and
sneer
at
you
for
you
were
always
sneering
at
my
james
you
always
looked
down
upon
him
in
your
heart
you
know
it
she
turned
back
to
jim
now
when
he
is
rich
she
began
and
then
swooped
again
on
me
you
are
rich
i
dare
you
to
deny
it
i
defy
you
to
look
me
in
the
face
and
try
to
deny
that
you
are
rich
rich
with
our
money
my
husband
money
heaven
knows
to
what
a
height
she
might
have
risen
being
by
this
time
bodily
whirled
away
in
her
own
hurricane
of
words
a
black
depression
a
treacherous
sympathy
with
my
assailant
pity
unutterable
for
poor
jim
already
filled
divided
and
abashed
my
spirit
flight
seemed
the
only
remedy
and
making
a
private
sign
to
jim
as
if
to
ask
permission
i
slunk
from
the
unequal
field
i
was
but
a
little
way
down
the
street
when
i
was
arrested
by
the
sound
of
some
one
running
and
jim
voice
calling
me
by
name
he
had
followed
me
with
a
letter
which
had
been
long
awaiting
my
return
i
took
it
in
a
dream
has
been
a
devil
of
a
business
said
i
think
hard
of
mamie
he
pleaded
the
way
she
made
her
loyalty
and
of
course
i
know
it
all
right
i
know
your
sterling
character
but
you
did
somehow
make
out
to
give
us
the
thing
straight
loudon
anybody
might
have
i
mean
it
i
mean
mind
what
you
mean
my
poor
jim
said
i
a
gallant
little
woman
and
a
loyal
wife
and
i
thought
her
splendid
my
story
was
as
fishy
as
the
devil
i
never
think
the
less
of
either
her
or
blow
over
it
must
blow
over
said
he
never
can
i
returned
sighing
do
you
try
to
make
it
do
name
me
unless
it
with
an
oath
and
get
home
to
her
right
away
good
by
my
best
of
friends
good
by
and
god
bless
you
we
shall
never
meet
loudon
that
we
should
live
to
say
such
words
he
cried
i
had
no
views
on
life
beyond
an
occasional
impulse
to
commit
suicide
or
to
get
drunk
and
drifted
down
the
street
walking
apparently
on
air
in
the
of
grief
i
had
money
in
my
pocket
whether
mine
or
my
creditors
i
had
no
means
of
guessing
and
the
poodle
dog
lying
in
my
path
i
went
mechanically
in
and
took
a
table
a
waiter
attended
me
and
i
suppose
i
gave
my
orders
for
presently
i
found
myself
with
a
sudden
return
of
consciousness
beginning
dinner
on
the
white
cloth
at
my
elbow
lay
the
letter
addressed
in
a
clerk
hand
and
bearing
an
english
stamp
and
the
edinburgh
postmark
a
bowl
of
bouillon
and
a
glass
of
wine
awakened
in
one
corner
of
my
brain
where
all
the
rest
was
in
mourning
the
blinds
down
as
for
a
funeral
a
faint
stir
of
curiosity
and
while
i
waited
the
next
course
wondering
the
while
what
i
had
ordered
i
opened
and
began
to
read
the
document
sir
i
am
charged
with
the
melancholy
duty
of
announcing
to
you
the
death
of
your
excellent
grandfather
alexander
loudon
on
the
ult
on
sunday
the
he
went
to
church
as
usual
in
the
forenoon
and
stopped
on
his
way
home
at
the
corner
of
princes
street
in
one
of
our
seasonable
east
winds
to
talk
with
an
old
friend
the
same
evening
acute
bronchitis
declared
itself
from
the
first
anticipated
a
fatal
result
and
the
old
gentleman
appeared
to
have
no
illusion
as
to
his
own
state
he
repeatedly
assured
me
it
was
with
him
now
high
time
too
he
once
added
with
characteristic
asperity
he
was
not
in
the
least
changed
on
the
approach
of
death
only
what
i
am
sure
must
be
very
grateful
to
your
feelings
he
seemed
to
think
and
speak
even
more
kindly
than
usual
of
yourself
referring
to
you
as
yin
with
strong
expressions
of
regard
was
the
only
one
i
ever
liket
of
the
hale
was
one
of
his
expressions
and
you
will
be
glad
to
know
that
he
dwelt
particularly
on
the
dutiful
respect
you
had
always
displayed
in
your
relations
the
small
codicil
by
which
he
bequeaths
you
his
molesworth
and
other
professional
works
was
added
you
will
observe
on
the
day
before
his
death
so
that
you
were
in
his
thoughts
until
the
end
i
should
say
that
though
rather
a
trying
patient
he
was
most
tenderly
nursed
by
your
uncle
and
your
cousin
miss
euphemia
i
enclose
a
copy
of
the
testament
by
which
you
will
see
that
you
share
equally
with
adam
and
that
i
hold
at
your
disposal
a
sum
nearly
approaching
seventeen
thousand
pounds
i
beg
to
congratulate
you
on
this
considerable
acquisition
and
expect
your
orders
to
which
i
shall
hasten
to
give
my
best
attention
thinking
that
you
might
desire
to
return
at
once
to
this
country
and
not
knowing
how
you
may
be
placed
i
enclose
a
credit
for
six
hundred
pounds
please
sign
the
accompanying
slip
and
let
me
have
it
at
your
earliest
convenience
am
dear
sir
yours
truly
rutherford
bless
the
old
gentleman
i
thought
for
that
matter
god
bless
uncle
adam
and
my
cousin
euphemia
and
gregg
i
had
a
vision
of
that
grey
old
life
now
brought
to
an
end
high
time
a
vision
of
those
sabbath
streets
alternately
vacant
and
filled
with
silent
people
of
the
babel
of
the
bells
the
psalmody
the
shrewd
sting
of
the
east
wind
the
hollow
echoing
dreary
house
to
which
had
returned
with
the
hand
of
death
already
on
his
shoulder
a
vision
too
of
the
long
rough
country
lad
perhaps
a
serious
courtier
of
the
lasses
in
the
hawthorn
den
perhaps
a
rustic
dancer
on
the
green
who
had
first
earned
and
answered
to
that
harsh
diminutive
and
i
asked
myself
if
on
the
whole
poor
ecky
had
succeeded
in
life
if
the
last
state
of
that
man
were
not
on
the
whole
worse
than
the
first
and
the
house
in
randolph
crescent
a
less
admirable
dwelling
than
the
hamlet
where
he
saw
the
day
and
grew
to
manhood
here
was
a
consolatory
thought
for
one
who
was
himself
a
failure
yes
i
declare
the
word
came
in
my
mind
and
all
the
while
in
another
partition
of
the
brain
i
was
glowing
and
singing
for
my
opulence
the
pile
of
gold
four
thousand
two
hundred
and
fifty
double
eagles
seventeen
thousand
ugly
sovereigns
thousand
two
hundred
and
fifty
napoleons
danced
and
rang
and
ran
molten
and
lit
up
life
with
their
effulgence
in
the
eye
of
fancy
here
were
all
things
made
plain
to
me
paradise
paris
i
mean
regained
carthew
protected
jim
restored

creditors
creditors
i
repeated
and
sank
back
benumbed
it
was
all
theirs
to
the
last
farthing
my
grandfather
had
died
too
soon
to
save
me
i
must
have
somewhere
a
rare
vein
of
decision
in
that
revolutionary
moment
i
found
myself
prepared
for
all
extremes
except
the
one
ready
to
do
anything
or
to
go
anywhere
so
long
as
i
might
save
my
money
at
the
worst
there
was
flight
flight
to
some
of
those
blest
countries
where
the
serpent
extradition
has
not
yet
entered
in
on
no
condition

allowed
in
callao
the
old
lawless
words
haunted
me
and
i
saw
myself
hugging
my
gold
in
the
company
of
such
men
as
had
once
made
and
sung
them
in
the
rude
and
bloody
wharfside
of
chili
and
peru
the
run
of
my
the
breach
of
my
old
friendship
this
bubble
fortune
flaunted
for
a
moment
in
my
eyes
and
snatched
again
had
made
me
desperate
and
in
the
expressive
vulgarism
ugly
to
drink
vile
spirits
among
vile
companions
by
the
flare
of
a
to
go
burthened
with
my
furtive
treasure
in
a
belt
to
fight
for
it
knife
in
hand
rolling
on
a
clay
floor
to
flee
perpetually
in
fresh
ships
and
to
be
chased
through
the
sea
from
isle
to
isle
seemed
in
my
then
frame
of
mind
a
welcome
series
of
events
that
was
for
the
worst
but
it
began
to
dawn
slowly
on
my
mind
that
there
was
yet
a
possible
better
once
escaped
once
safe
in
callao
i
might
approach
my
creditors
with
a
good
grace
and
properly
handled
by
a
cunning
agent
it
was
just
possible
they
might
accept
some
easy
composition
the
hope
recalled
me
to
the
bankruptcy
it
was
strange
i
reflected
often
as
i
had
questioned
jim
he
had
never
obliged
me
with
an
answer
in
his
haste
for
news
about
the
wreck
my
own
no
less
legitimate
curiosity
had
gone
disappointed
hateful
as
the
thought
was
to
me
i
must
return
at
once
and
find
out
where
i
stood
i
left
my
dinner
still
unfinished
paying
for
the
whole
of
course
and
tossing
the
waiter
a
gold
piece
i
was
reckless
i
knew
not
what
was
mine
and
cared
not
i
must
take
what
i
could
get
and
give
as
i
was
able
to
rob
and
to
squander
seemed
the
complementary
parts
of
my
new
destiny
i
walked
up
bush
street
whistling
brazening
myself
to
confront
mamie
in
the
first
place
and
the
world
at
large
and
a
certain
visionary
judge
upon
a
bench
in
the
second
just
outside
i
stopped
and
lighted
a
cigar
to
give
me
greater
countenance
and
puffing
this
and
wearing
what
i
am
sure
was
a
wretched
assumption
of
braggadocio
i
reappeared
on
the
scene
of
my
disgrace
my
friend
and
his
wife
were
finishing
a
poor
meal
rags
of
old
mutton
the
remainder
cakes
from
breakfast
eaten
cold
and
a
starveling
pot
of
coffee
beg
your
pardon
pinkerton
said
i
to
inflict
my
presence
where
it
can
not
be
desired
but
there
is
a
piece
of
business
necessary
to
be
do
not
consider
me
said
mamie
rising
and
she
sailed
into
the
adjoining
bedroom
jim
watched
her
go
and
shook
his
head
he
looked
miserably
old
and
is
it
now
he
asked
you
remember
you
answered
none
of
my
questions
said
i
questions
faltered
jim
so
jim
my
questions
i
repeated
put
questions
as
well
as
yourself
and
however
little
i
may
have
satisfied
mamie
with
my
answers
i
beg
to
remind
you
that
you
gave
me
none
at
mean
about
the
bankruptcy
asked
jim
i
nodded
he
writhed
in
his
chair
straight
truth
is
i
was
ashamed
he
said
was
trying
to
dodge
you
i
been
playing
fast
and
loose
with
you
loudon
i
deceived
you
from
the
first
i
blush
to
own
it
and
here
you
came
home
and
put
the
very
question
i
was
fearing
why
did
we
bust
so
soon
your
keen
business
eye
had
not
deceived
you
that
the
point
that
my
shame
that
what
killed
me
this
afternoon
when
mamie
was
treating
you
so
and
my
conscience
was
telling
me
all
the
time
thou
art
the
was
it
jim
i
asked
i
had
been
at
all
the
time
loudon
he
wailed
i
do
know
how
i
to
look
you
in
the
face
and
say
it
after
my
duplicity
it
was
stocks
he
added
in
a
whisper
you
were
afraid
to
tell
me
that
i
cried
poor
old
cheerless
dreamer
what
would
it
matter
what
you
did
or
did
you
see
we
doomed
and
anyway
that
not
my
point
it
how
i
stand
that
i
want
to
know
there
is
a
particular
reason
am
i
clear
have
i
a
certificate
or
what
have
i
to
do
to
get
one
and
when
will
it
be
dated
you
ca
think
what
hangs
by
it
the
worst
of
all
said
jim
like
a
man
in
a
dream
ca
see
how
to
tell
him
do
you
mean
i
cried
a
small
pang
of
terror
at
my
heart
afraid
i
sacrificed
you
loudon
he
said
looking
at
me
pitifully
me
i
repeated
what
do
you
mean
by
sacrifice
know
it
shock
your
delicate
he
said
what
was
i
to
do
things
looked
so
bad
the
receiver
as
usual
the
name
stuck
in
his
throat
and
he
began
afresh
was
a
lot
of
talk
the
reporters
were
after
me
already
there
was
the
trouble
and
all
about
the
mexican
business
and
i
got
scared
right
out
and
i
guess
i
lost
my
head
you
were
there
you
see
and
that
was
my
i
did
not
know
how
long
he
might
thus
beat
about
the
bush
with
dreadful
hintings
and
i
was
already
beside
myself
with
terror
what
had
he
done
i
saw
he
had
been
tempted
i
knew
from
his
letters
that
he
was
in
no
condition
to
resist
how
had
he
sacrificed
the
absent
i
said
must
speak
right
out
i
got
all
that
i
can
he
said
know
it
was
a
liberty
i
made
it
out
you
were
no
business
man
only
a
painter
that
half
the
time
you
know
anything
anyway
particularly
money
and
accounts
i
said
you
never
could
be
got
to
understand
whose
was
whose
i
had
to
say
that
because
of
some
entries
in
the
books
god
sake
i
cried
me
out
of
this
agony
what
did
you
accuse
me
of
you
of
repeated
jim
what
i
telling
you
and
there
being
no
deed
of
partnership
i
made
out
you
were
only
a
kind
of
clerk
that
i
called
a
partner
just
to
give
you
taffy
and
so
i
got
you
ranked
a
creditor
on
the
estate
for
your
wages
and
the
money
you
had
lent
and
i
believe
i
reeled
creditor
i
roared
creditor
i
not
in
the
bankruptcy
at
all
said
jim
know
it
was
a
liberty
damn
your
liberty

that
i
cried
dashing
the
letter
before
him
on
the
table
call
in
your
wife
and
be
done
with
eating
this
truck
as
i
spoke
i
slung
the
cold
mutton
in
the
empty
grate
let
all
go
and
have
a
champagne
supper
i
dined
i
sure
i
remember
what
i
had
i
dine
again
ten
scores
of
times
upon
a
night
like
this
read
it
you
blaying
ass
i
not
insane
here
mamie
i
continued
opening
the
bedroom
door
out
and
make
it
up
with
me
and
go
and
kiss
your
husband
and
i
tell
you
what

the
supper

place

a
sheet
of
paper
and
tell
franklin
dodge
to
go
to
texas
mamie
you
were
right
my
dear
i
was
rich
all
the
time
and
did
know
chapter
xix
travels
with
a
shyster
the
absorbing
and
disastrous
adventure
of
the
flying
scud
was
now
quite
ended
we
had
dashed
into
these
deep
waters
and
we
had
escaped
again
to
starve
we
had
been
ruined
and
were
saved
had
quarrelled
and
made
up
there
remained
nothing
but
to
sing
te
deum
draw
a
line
and
begin
on
a
fresh
page
of
my
unwritten
diary
i
do
not
pretend
that
i
recovered
all
i
had
lost
with
mamie
it
would
have
been
more
than
i
had
merited
and
i
had
certainly
been
more
uncommunicative
than
became
either
the
partner
or
the
friend
but
she
accepted
the
position
handsomely
and
during
the
week
that
i
now
passed
with
them
both
she
and
jim
had
the
grace
to
spare
me
questions
it
was
to
calistoga
that
we
went
there
was
some
rumour
of
a
napa
at
the
moment
the
possibility
of
stir
attracted
jim
and
he
informed
me
he
would
find
a
certain
joy
in
looking
on
much
as
napoleon
on
helena
took
a
pleasure
to
read
military
works
the
field
of
his
ambition
was
quite
closed
he
was
done
with
action
and
looked
forward
to
a
ranch
in
a
mountain
dingle
a
patch
of
corn
a
pair
of
kine
a
leisurely
and
contemplative
age
in
the
green
shade
of
forests
let
me
get
down
on
my
back
in
a
hayfield
said
he
you
find
there
no
more
snap
to
me
than
that
much
and
for
two
days
the
perfervid
being
actually
rested
the
third
he
was
observed
in
consultation
with
the
local
editor
and
owned
he
was
in
two
minds
about
purchasing
the
press
and
paper
a
kind
of
a
hold
for
an
idle
man
he
said
pleadingly
if
the
section
was
to
open
up
the
way
it
ought
to
there
might
be
dollars
in
the
on
the
fourth
day
he
was
gone
till
alone
on
the
fifth
we
made
a
long
picnic
drive
to
the
fresh
field
of
enterprise
and
the
sixth
was
passed
entirely
in
the
preparation
of
prospectuses
the
pioneer
of
mcbride
city
was
already
upright
and
as
of
yore
the
fire
rekindled
in
his
eye
the
ring
restored
to
his
voice
a
charger
sniffing
battle
and
saying
among
the
spears
on
the
seventh
morning
we
signed
a
deed
of
partnership
for
jim
would
not
accept
a
dollar
of
my
money
otherwise
and
having
once
more
engaged
myself
or
that
mortal
part
of
me
my
purse
among
the
wheels
of
his
machinery
i
returned
alone
to
san
francisco
and
took
quarters
in
the
palace
hotel
the
same
night
i
had
nares
to
dinner
his
sunburnt
face
his
queer
and
personal
strain
of
talk
recalled
days
that
were
scarce
over
and
that
seemed
already
distant
through
the
music
of
the
band
outside
and
the
chink
and
clatter
of
the
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
heard
the
foaming
of
the
surf
and
the
voices
of
the
about
midway
island
the
bruises
on
our
hands
were
not
yet
healed
and
there
we
sat
waited
on
by
elaborate
darkies
eating
pompano
and
drinking
iced
champagne
of
our
dinners
on
the
norah
captain
and
then
oblige
me
by
looking
round
the
room
for
he
took
the
scene
in
slowly
it
is
like
a
dream
he
said
as
if
the
darkies
were
really
about
as
big
as
dimes
and
a
great
big
scuttle
might
open
up
there
and
johnson
stick
in
a
great
big
head
and
shoulders
and
cry
bells
and
the
whole
thing
it
the
other
thing
that
has
done
that
i
replied
all
bygone
now
all
dead
and
buried
amen
say
do
know
that
dodd
and
to
tell
you
the
fact
i
do
believe
it
said
nares
more
flying
scud
in
the
oven
and
the
name
i
take
it
is
bellairs
he
tackled
me
the
day
we
came
in
sort
of
a
razee
of
poor
old
humanity
jury
clothes
full
new
suit
of
pimples
knew
him
at
once
from
your
description
i
let
him
pump
me
till
i
saw
his
game
he
knows
a
good
deal
that
we
do
know
a
good
deal
that
we
do
and
suspects
the
balance
there
trouble
brewing
for
i
was
surprised
i
had
not
thought
of
this
before
bellairs
had
been
behind
the
scenes
he
had
known
dickson
he
knew
the
flight
of
the
crew
it
was
hardly
possible
but
what
he
should
suspect
it
was
certain
if
he
suspected
that
he
would
seek
to
trade
on
the
suspicion
and
sure
enough
i
was
not
yet
dressed
the
next
morning
ere
the
lawyer
was
knocking
at
my
door
i
let
him
in
for
i
was
curious
and
he
after
some
ambiguous
prolegomena
roundly
proposed
i
should
go
shares
with
him
in
what
i
inquired
you
will
allow
me
to
clothe
my
idea
in
a
somewhat
vulgar
form
said
he
might
ask
you
did
you
go
to
midway
for
your
health
do
know
that
i
did
i
replied
dodd
you
may
be
sure
i
would
never
have
taken
the
present
step
without
influential
grounds
pursued
the
lawyer
is
foreign
to
my
character
but
you
and
i
sir
are
engaged
on
the
same
ends
if
we
can
continue
to
work
the
thing
in
company
i
place
at
your
disposal
my
knowledge
of
the
law
and
a
considerable
practice
in
delicate
negotiations
similar
to
this
should
you
refuse
to
consent
you
might
find
in
me
a
formidable
he
hesitated
to
my
own
regret
perhaps
a
dangerous
you
get
this
by
heart
i
asked
genially
advise
you
to
he
said
with
a
sudden
sparkle
of
temper
and
menace
instantly
gone
instantly
succeeded
by
fresh
cringing
assure
you
sir
i
arrive
in
the
character
of
a
friend
and
i
believe
you
underestimate
my
information
if
i
may
instance
an
example
i
am
acquainted
to
the
last
dime
with
what
you
made
or
rather
lost
and
i
know
you
have
since
cashed
a
considerable
draft
on
do
you
infer
i
asked
know
where
that
draft
came
from
he
cried
wincing
back
like
one
who
has
greatly
dared
and
instantly
regrets
the
venture
said
i
forget
i
was
dickson
confidential
agent
he
explained
had
his
address
dodd
we
were
the
only
two
that
he
communicated
with
in
san
francisco
you
see
my
deductions
are
quite
obvious
you
see
how
open
and
frank
i
deal
with
you
as
i
should
wish
to
do
with
any
gentleman
with
whom
i
was
conjoined
in
business
you
see
how
much
i
know
and
it
can
scarcely
escape
your
strong
how
much
better
it
would
be
if
i
knew
all
you
can
not
hope
to
get
rid
of
me
at
this
time
of
day
i
have
my
place
in
the
affair
i
can
not
be
shaken
off
i
am
if
you
will
excuse
a
rather
technical
pleasantry
an
encumbrance
on
the
estate
the
actual
harm
i
can
do
i
leave
you
to
valuate
for
yourself
but
without
going
so
far
dodd
and
without
in
any
way
inconveniencing
myself
i
could
make
things
very
uncomfortable
for
instance
pinkerton
liquidation
you
and
i
know
sir
and
you
better
than
i
on
what
a
large
fund
you
draw
is
pinkerton
in
the
thing
at
all
it
was
you
only
who
knew
the
address
and
you
were
concealing
it
suppose
i
should
communicate
with
pinkerton
here
i
interrupted
with
him
if
you
will
permit
me
to
clothe
my
idea
in
a
vulgar
shape
till
you
are
blue
in
the
face
there
is
only
one
person
with
whom
i
refuse
to
allow
you
to
communicate
further
and
that
is
myself
good
he
could
not
conceal
his
rage
disappointment
and
surprise
and
in
the
passage
i
have
no
doubt
was
shaken
by
vitus
i
was
disgusted
by
this
interview
it
struck
me
hard
to
be
suspected
on
all
hands
and
to
hear
again
from
this
trafficker
what
i
had
heard
already
from
jim
wife
and
yet
my
strongest
impression
was
different
and
might
rather
be
described
as
an
impersonal
fear
there
was
something
against
nature
in
the
man
craven
impudence
it
was
as
though
a
lamb
had
butted
me
such
daring
at
the
hands
of
such
a
dastard
implied
unchangeable
resolve
a
great
pressure
of
necessity
and
powerful
means
i
thought
of
the
unknown
carthew
and
it
sickened
me
to
see
this
ferret
on
his
trail
upon
inquiry
i
found
the
lawyer
was
but
just
disbarred
for
some
malpractice
and
the
discovery
added
excessively
to
my
disquiet
here
was
a
rascal
without
money
or
the
means
of
making
it
thrust
out
of
the
doors
of
his
own
trade
publicly
shamed
and
doubtless
in
a
deuce
of
a
bad
temper
with
the
universe
here
on
the
other
hand
was
a
man
with
a
secret
rich
terrified
practically
in
hiding
who
had
been
willing
to
pay
ten
thousand
pounds
for
the
bones
of
the
flying
scud
i
slipped
insensibly
into
a
mental
alliance
with
the
victim
the
business
weighed
on
me
all
day
long
i
was
wondering
how
much
the
lawyer
knew
how
much
he
guessed
and
when
he
would
open
his
attack
some
of
these
problems
are
unsolved
to
this
day
others
were
soon
made
clear
where
he
got
carthew
name
is
still
a
mystery
perhaps
some
sailor
on
the
tempest
perhaps
my
own
served
him
for
a
tool
but
i
was
actually
at
his
elbow
when
he
learned
the
address
it
fell
so
one
evening
when
i
had
an
engagement
and
was
killing
time
until
the
hour
i
chanced
to
walk
in
the
court
of
the
hotel
while
the
band
played
the
place
was
bright
as
day
with
the
electric
light
and
i
recognised
at
some
distance
among
the
loiterers
the
person
of
bellairs
in
talk
with
a
gentleman
whose
face
appeared
familiar
it
was
certainly
some
one
i
had
seen
and
seen
recently
but
who
or
where
i
knew
not
a
porter
standing
hard
by
gave
me
the
necessary
hint
the
stranger
was
an
english
navy
man
invalided
home
from
honolulu
where
he
had
left
his
ship
indeed
it
was
only
from
the
change
of
clothes
and
the
effects
of
sickness
that
i
had
not
immediately
recognised
my
friend
and
correspondent
lieutenant
sebright
the
conjunction
of
these
planets
seeming
ominous
i
drew
near
but
it
seemed
bellairs
had
done
his
business
he
vanished
in
the
crowd
and
i
found
my
officer
alone
you
know
whom
you
have
been
talking
to
sebright
i
began
said
he
do
know
him
from
adam
anything
wrong
is
a
disreputable
lawyer
recently
disbarred
said
i
wish
i
had
seen
you
in
time
i
trust
you
told
him
nothing
about
carthew
he
flushed
to
his
ears
awfully
sorry
he
said
seemed
civil
and
i
wanted
to
get
rid
of
him
it
was
only
the
address
he
you
gave
it
i
cried
really
awfully
sorry
said
sebright
afraid
i
forgive
you
was
my
only
comment
and
i
turned
my
back
upon
the
blunderer
the
fat
was
in
the
fire
now
bellairs
had
the
address
and
i
was
the
more
deceived
or
carthew
would
have
news
of
him
so
strong
was
this
impression
and
so
painful
that
the
next
morning
i
had
the
curiosity
to
pay
the
lawyer
den
a
visit
an
old
woman
was
scrubbing
the
stair
and
the
board
was
down
bellairs
said
the
old
woman
east
this
morning
lawyer
dean
next
block
i
did
not
trouble
lawyer
dean
but
walked
slowly
back
to
my
hotel
ruminating
as
i
went
the
image
of
the
old
woman
washing
that
desecrated
stair
had
struck
my
fancy
it
seemed
that
all
the
of
the
city
and
all
the
soap
in
the
state
would
scarce
suffice
to
cleanse
it
it
had
been
so
long
a
of
dingy
secrets
and
a
factory
of
sordid
fraud
and
now
the
corner
was
untenanted
some
judge
like
a
careful
housewife
had
knocked
down
the
web
and
the
bloated
spider
was
scuttling
elsewhere
after
new
victims
i
had
of
late
as
i
have
said
insensibly
taken
sides
with
carthew
now
when
his
enemy
was
at
his
heels
my
interest
grew
more
warm
and
i
began
to
wonder
if
i
could
not
help
the
drama
of
the
flying
scud
was
entering
on
a
new
phase
it
had
been
singular
from
the
first
it
promised
an
extraordinary
conclusion
and
i
who
had
paid
so
much
to
learn
the
beginning
might
pay
a
little
more
and
see
the
end
i
lingered
in
san
francisco
indemnifying
myself
after
the
hardships
of
the
cruise
spending
money
regretting
it
continually
promising
departure
for
the
morrow
why
not
go
indeed
and
keep
a
watch
upon
bellairs
if
i
missed
him
there
was
no
harm
done
i
was
the
nearer
paris
if
i
found
and
kept
his
trail
it
was
hard
if
i
could
not
put
some
stick
in
his
machinery
and
at
the
worst
i
could
promise
myself
interesting
scenes
and
revelations
in
such
a
mixed
humour
i
made
up
what
it
pleases
me
to
call
my
mind
and
once
more
involved
myself
in
the
story
of
carthew
and
the
flying
scud
the
same
night
i
wrote
a
letter
of
farewell
to
jim
and
one
of
anxious
warning
to
urquart
begging
him
to
set
carthew
on
his
guard
the
morrow
saw
me
in
the
and
ten
days
later
i
was
walking
the
hurricane
deck
on
the
city
of
denver
by
that
time
my
mind
was
pretty
much
made
down
again
its
natural
condition
i
told
myself
that
i
was
bound
for
paris
or
fontainebleau
to
resume
the
study
of
the
arts
and
i
thought
no
more
of
carthew
or
bellairs
or
only
to
smile
at
my
own
fondness
the
one
i
could
not
serve
even
if
i
wanted
the
other
i
had
no
means
of
finding
even
if
i
could
have
at
all
influenced
him
after
he
was
found
and
for
all
that
i
was
close
on
the
heels
of
an
absurd
adventure
my
neighbour
at
table
that
evening
was
a
man
whom
i
knew
slightly
i
found
he
had
crossed
the
plains
two
days
in
front
of
me
and
this
was
the
first
steamer
that
had
left
new
york
for
europe
since
his
arrival
two
days
before
me
meant
a
day
before
bellairs
and
dinner
was
scarce
done
before
i
was
closeted
with
the
purser
he
repeated
in
the
saloon
i
am
sure
he
may
be
in
the
second
class
the
lists
are
not
made
out
but
hullo
d
bellairs
that
the
name
he
there
right
and
the
next
morning
i
saw
him
on
the
forward
deck
sitting
in
a
chair
a
book
in
his
hand
a
shabby
puma
skin
rug
about
his
knees
the
picture
of
respectable
decay
off
and
on
i
kept
him
in
my
eye
he
read
a
good
deal
he
stood
and
looked
upon
the
sea
he
talked
occasionally
with
his
neighbours
and
once
when
a
child
fell
he
picked
it
up
and
soothed
it
i
damned
him
in
my
heart
the
book
which
i
was
sure
he
did
not
read
the
sea
to
which
i
was
ready
to
take
oath
he
was
indifferent
the
child
whom
i
was
certain
he
would
as
lieve
have
tossed
overboard
all
seemed
to
me
elements
in
a
theatrical
performance
and
i
made
no
doubt
he
was
already
nosing
after
the
secrets
of
his
i
took
no
pains
to
conceal
myself
my
scorn
for
the
creature
being
as
strong
as
my
disgust
but
he
never
looked
my
way
and
it
was
night
before
i
learned
he
had
observed
me
i
was
smoking
by
the
door
for
the
air
was
a
little
sharp
when
a
voice
rose
close
beside
me
in
the
darkness
beg
your
pardon
dodd
it
said
you
bellairs
i
replied
single
word
sir
your
presence
on
this
ship
has
no
connection
with
our
interview
he
asked
have
no
idea
dodd
of
returning
upon
your
determination
said
i
and
then
seeing
he
still
lingered
i
was
polite
enough
to
add
evening
at
which
he
sighed
and
went
away
the
next
day
he
was
there
again
with
the
chair
and
the
puma
skin
read
his
book
and
looked
at
the
sea
with
the
same
constancy
and
though
there
was
no
child
to
be
picked
up
i
observed
him
to
attend
repeatedly
on
a
sick
woman
nothing
fosters
suspicion
like
the
act
of
watching
a
man
spied
upon
can
hardly
blow
his
nose
but
we
accuse
him
of
designs
and
i
took
an
early
opportunity
to
go
forward
and
see
the
woman
for
myself
she
was
poor
elderly
and
painfully
plain
i
stood
abashed
at
the
sight
felt
i
owed
bellairs
amends
for
the
injustice
of
my
thoughts
and
seeing
him
standing
by
the
rail
in
his
usual
attitude
of
contemplation
walked
up
and
addressed
him
by
name
seem
very
fond
of
the
sea
said
i
may
really
call
it
a
passion
dodd
he
replied
the
tall
cataract
haunted
me
like
a
passion
he
quoted
never
weary
of
the
sea
sir
this
is
my
first
ocean
voyage
i
find
it
a
glorious
and
once
more
my
disbarred
lawyer
dropped
into
poetry
on
thou
deep
and
dark
blue
ocean
roll
though
i
had
learned
the
piece
in
my
at
school
i
came
into
the
world
a
little
too
late
on
the
one
hand
and
i
daresay
a
little
too
early
on
the
other
to
think
much
of
byron
and
the
sonorous
verse
prodigiously
well
delivered
struck
me
with
surprise
are
fond
of
poetry
too
i
asked
am
a
great
reader
he
replied
one
time
i
had
begun
to
amass
quite
a
small
but
well
selected
library
and
when
that
was
scattered
i
still
managed
to
preserve
a
few
volumes
chiefly
of
pieces
designed
for
recitation
which
have
been
my
travelling
that
one
of
them
i
asked
pointing
to
the
volume
in
his
hand
sir
he
replied
showing
me
a
translation
of
the
of
is
a
novel
i
picked
up
some
time
ago
it
has
afforded
me
great
pleasure
though
immoral
cried
i
indignant
as
usual
at
any
complication
of
art
and
ethics
you
can
not
deny
that
sir
if
you
know
the
book
he
said
passion
is
illicit
although
certainly
drawn
with
a
good
deal
of
pathos
it
is
not
a
work
one
could
possibly
put
into
the
hands
of
a
lady
which
is
to
be
regretted
on
all
accounts
for
i
do
not
know
how
it
may
strike
you
but
it
seems
to
me
as
a
depiction
if
i
make
myself
clear
to
rise
high
above
its
compeers
even
famous
compeers
even
in
scott
dickens
thackeray
or
hawthorne
the
sentiment
of
love
appears
to
me
to
be
frequently
done
less
justice
are
expressing
a
very
general
opinion
said
i
that
so
indeed
sir
he
exclaimed
with
unmistakable
excitement
the
book
well
known
and
who
was
i
am
interested
in
that
because
upon
the
the
usual
initials
are
omitted
and
it
runs
simply
was
he
an
author
of
distinction
has
he
written
other
works
such
was
our
first
interview
the
first
of
many
and
in
all
he
showed
the
same
attractive
qualities
and
defects
his
taste
for
literature
was
native
and
unaffected
his
sentimentality
although
extreme
and
a
thought
ridiculous
was
plainly
genuine
i
wondered
at
my
own
innocent
wonder
i
knew
that
homer
nodded
that
caesar
had
compiled
a
that
turner
lived
by
preference
the
life
of
puggy
booth
that
shelley
made
paper
boats
and
wordsworth
wore
green
spectacles
and
with
all
this
mass
of
evidence
before
me
i
had
expected
bellairs
to
be
entirely
of
one
piece
subdued
to
what
he
worked
in
a
spy
all
through
as
i
abominated
the
man
trade
so
i
had
expected
to
detest
the
man
himself
and
behold
i
liked
him
poor
devil
he
was
essentially
a
man
on
wires
all
sensibility
and
tremor
brimful
of
a
cheap
poetry
not
without
parts
quite
without
courage
his
boldness
was
despair
the
gulf
behind
him
thrust
him
on
he
was
one
of
those
who
might
commit
a
murder
rather
than
confess
the
theft
of
a
i
was
sure
that
his
coming
interview
with
carthew
rode
his
imagination
like
a
nightmare
when
the
thought
crossed
his
mind
i
used
to
think
i
knew
of
it
and
that
the
qualm
appeared
in
his
face
visibly
yet
he
would
never
flinch
necessity
stalking
at
his
back
famine
his
old
pursuer
talking
in
his
ear
and
i
used
to
wonder
whether
i
most
admired
or
most
despised
this
quivering
heroism
for
evil
the
image
that
occurred
to
me
after
his
visit
was
just
i
had
been
butted
by
a
lamb
and
the
phase
of
life
that
i
was
now
studying
might
be
called
the
revolt
of
a
sheep
it
could
be
said
of
him
that
he
had
learned
in
sorrow
what
he
taught
in
song
or
wrong
and
his
life
was
that
of
one
of
his
victims
he
was
born
in
the
back
parts
of
the
state
of
new
york
his
father
a
farmer
who
became
subsequently
bankrupt
and
went
west
the
lawyer
and
who
had
ruined
this
poor
family
seems
to
have
conceived
in
the
end
a
feeling
of
remorse
he
turned
the
father
out
indeed
but
he
offered
in
compensation
to
charge
himself
with
one
of
the
sons
and
harry
the
fifth
child
and
already
sickly
was
chosen
to
be
left
behind
he
made
himself
useful
in
the
office
picked
up
the
scattered
rudiments
of
an
education
read
right
and
left
attended
and
debated
at
the
young
christian
association
and
in
all
his
early
years
was
the
model
for
a
good
his
landlady
daughter
was
his
bane
he
showed
me
her
photograph
she
was
a
big
handsome
dashing
dressy
vulgar
hussy
without
character
without
tenderness
without
mind
and
as
the
result
proved
without
virtue
the
sickly
and
timid
boy
was
in
the
house
he
was
handy
when
she
was
otherwise
unoccupied
she
used
and
played
with
him
romeo
and
cressida
till
in
that
dreary
life
of
a
poor
boy
in
a
country
town
she
grew
to
be
the
light
of
his
days
and
the
subject
of
his
dreams
he
worked
hard
like
jacob
for
a
wife
he
surpassed
his
patron
in
sharp
practice
he
was
made
head
clerk
and
the
same
night
encouraged
by
a
hundred
freedoms
depressed
by
the
sense
of
his
youth
and
his
infirmities
he
offered
marriage
and
was
received
with
laughter
not
a
year
had
passed
before
his
master
conscious
of
growing
infirmities
took
him
for
a
partner
he
proposed
again
he
was
accepted
led
two
years
of
troubled
married
life
and
awoke
one
morning
to
find
his
wife
had
run
away
with
a
dashing
drummer
and
had
left
him
heavily
in
debt
the
debt
and
not
the
drummer
was
supposed
to
be
the
cause
of
the
hegira
she
had
concealed
her
liabilities
they
were
on
the
point
of
bursting
forth
she
was
weary
of
bellairs
and
she
took
the
drummer
as
she
might
have
taken
a
cab
the
blow
disabled
her
husband
his
partner
was
dead
he
was
now
alone
in
the
business
for
which
he
was
no
longer
fit
the
debts
hampered
him
bankruptcy
followed
and
he
fled
from
city
to
city
falling
daily
into
lower
practice
it
is
to
be
considered
that
he
had
been
taught
and
had
learned
as
a
delightful
duty
a
kind
of
business
whose
highest
merit
is
to
escape
the
commentaries
of
the
bench
that
of
the
usurious
lawyer
in
a
county
town
with
this
training
he
was
now
shot
a
penniless
stranger
into
the
deeper
gulfs
of
cities
and
the
result
is
scarce
a
thing
to
be
surprised
at
you
heard
of
your
wife
again
i
asked
he
displayed
a
pitiful
agitation
am
afraid
you
will
think
ill
of
me
he
said
you
taken
her
back
i
asked
sir
i
trust
i
have
too
much
he
answered
at
least
i
was
never
tempted
she
wo
come
she
dislikes
she
seems
to
have
conceived
a
positive
distaste
for
me
and
yet
i
was
considered
an
indulgent
are
still
in
relations
then
i
asked
place
myself
in
your
hands
dodd
he
replied
world
is
very
hard
i
have
found
it
bitter
hard
myself
bitter
hard
to
live
how
much
worse
for
a
woman
and
one
who
has
placed
herself
by
her
own
misconduct
i
am
far
from
denying
that
in
so
unfortunate
a
position
short
you
support
her
i
suggested
can
not
deny
it
i
practically
do
he
admitted
has
been
a
round
my
neck
but
i
think
she
is
grateful
you
can
see
for
he
handed
me
a
letter
in
a
sprawling
ignorant
hand
but
written
with
violet
ink
on
fine
pink
paper
with
a
monogram
it
was
very
foolishly
expressed
and
i
thought
except
for
a
few
obvious
cajoleries
very
heartless
and
greedy
in
meaning
the
writer
said
she
had
been
sick
which
i
disbelieved
declared
the
last
remittance
was
all
gone
in
doctor
bills
for
which
i
took
the
liberty
of
substituting
dress
drink
and
monograms
and
prayed
for
an
increase
which
i
could
only
hope
had
been
denied
her
think
she
is
really
grateful
he
asked
with
some
eagerness
as
i
returned
it
daresay
said
i
she
any
claim
on
you
no
sir
i
divorced
her
he
replied
have
a
very
strong
sense
of
in
such
matters
and
i
divorced
her
sort
of
life
is
she
leading
now
i
asked
will
not
deceive
you
dodd
i
do
not
know
i
make
a
point
of
not
knowing
it
appears
more
dignified
i
have
been
very
harshly
criticised
he
added
sighing
it
will
be
seen
that
i
had
fallen
into
an
ignominious
intimacy
with
the
man
i
had
gone
out
to
thwart
my
pity
for
the
creature
his
admiration
for
myself
his
pleasure
in
my
society
which
was
clearly
unassumed
were
the
bonds
with
which
i
was
fettered
perhaps
i
should
add
in
honesty
my
own
interest
in
the
phases
of
life
and
human
character
the
fact
is
at
least
that
we
spent
hours
together
daily
and
that
i
was
nearly
as
much
on
the
forward
deck
as
in
the
saloon
yet
all
the
while
i
could
never
forget
he
was
a
shabby
trickster
embarked
that
very
moment
in
a
dirty
enterprise
i
used
to
tell
myself
at
first
that
our
acquaintance
was
a
stroke
of
art
and
that
i
was
somehow
fortifying
carthew
i
told
myself
i
say
but
i
was
no
such
fool
as
to
believe
it
even
then
in
these
circumstances
i
displayed
the
two
chief
qualities
of
my
character
on
the
largest
scale
my
helplessness
and
my
instinctive
love
of
procrastination
and
fell
upon
a
course
of
action
so
ridiculous
that
i
blush
when
i
recall
it
we
reached
liverpool
one
forenoon
the
rain
falling
thickly
and
insidiously
on
the
filthy
town
i
had
no
plans
beyond
a
sensible
unwillingness
to
let
my
rascal
escape
and
i
ended
by
going
to
the
same
inn
with
him
dining
with
him
walking
with
him
in
the
wet
streets
and
hearing
with
him
in
a
penny
gaff
that
venerable
piece
it
was
one
of
his
first
visits
to
a
theatre
against
which
places
of
entertainment
he
had
a
strong
prejudice
and
his
innocent
pompous
talk
innocent
old
quotations
and
innocent
reverence
for
the
character
of
hawkshaw
delighted
me
beyond
relief
in
charity
to
myself
i
dwell
upon
and
perhaps
exaggerate
my
pleasures
i
have
need
of
all
conceivable
excuses
when
i
confess
that
i
went
to
bed
without
one
word
upon
the
matter
of
carthew
but
not
without
having
covenanted
with
my
rascal
for
a
visit
to
chester
the
next
day
at
chester
we
did
the
cathedral
walked
on
the
walls
discussed
shakespeare
and
the
musical
glasses
and
made
a
fresh
engagement
for
the
morrow
i
do
not
know
and
i
am
glad
to
have
forgotten
how
long
these
travels
were
continued
we
visited
at
least
by
singular
zigzags
stratford
warwick
coventry
gloucester
bristol
bath
and
wells
at
each
stage
we
spoke
dutifully
of
the
scene
and
its
associations
i
sketched
the
shyster
spouted
poetry
and
copied
epitaphs
who
could
doubt
we
were
the
usual
americans
travelling
with
a
design
of
who
was
to
guess
that
one
was
a
blackmailer
trembling
to
approach
the
scene
of
action
the
other
a
helpless
amateur
detective
waiting
on
events
it
is
unnecessary
to
remark
that
none
occurred
or
none
the
least
suitable
with
my
design
of
protecting
carthew
two
trifles
indeed
completed
though
they
scarcely
changed
my
conception
of
the
shyster
the
first
was
observed
in
gloucester
where
we
spent
sunday
and
i
proposed
we
should
hear
service
in
the
cathedral
to
my
surprise
the
creature
had
an
ism
of
his
own
to
which
he
was
loyal
and
he
left
me
to
go
alone
to
the
cathedral
or
perhaps
not
to
go
at
all
and
stole
off
down
a
deserted
alley
to
some
bethel
or
ebenezer
of
the
proper
shade
when
we
met
again
at
lunch
i
rallied
him
and
he
grew
restive
need
employ
no
circumlocutions
with
me
dodd
he
said
suddenly
regard
my
behaviour
from
an
unfavourable
point
of
view
you
regard
me
i
much
fear
as
i
was
somewhat
confused
by
the
attack
know
what
i
think
of
your
trade
i
replied
lamely
and
coarsely
me
if
i
seem
to
press
the
subject
he
continued
if
you
think
my
life
erroneous
would
you
have
me
neglect
the
means
of
grace
because
you
consider
me
in
the
wrong
on
one
point
would
you
have
me
place
myself
on
the
wrong
in
all
surely
sir
the
church
is
for
the
you
ask
a
blessing
on
your
present
enterprise
i
sneered
he
had
a
bad
attack
of
vitus
his
face
was
changed
and
his
eyes
flashed
will
tell
you
what
i
did
he
cried
prayed
for
an
unfortunate
man
and
a
wretched
woman
whom
he
tries
to
i
can
not
pretend
that
i
found
any
repartee
the
second
incident
was
at
bristol
where
i
lost
sight
of
my
gentleman
some
hours
from
this
eclipse
he
returned
to
me
with
thick
speech
wandering
footsteps
and
a
back
all
whitened
with
plaster
i
had
half
expected
yet
i
could
have
wept
to
see
it
all
disabilities
were
piled
on
that
weak
back
domestic
misfortune
nervous
disease
a
displeasing
exterior
empty
pockets
and
the
slavery
of
vice
i
will
never
deny
that
our
prolonged
conjunction
was
the
result
of
double
cowardice
each
was
afraid
to
leave
the
other
each
was
afraid
to
speak
or
knew
not
what
to
say
save
for
my
allusion
at
gloucester
the
subject
uppermost
in
both
our
minds
was
buried
carthew
which
we
had
long
since
and
severally
identified
to
be
the
nearest
station
even
the
name
of
dorsetshire
was
studiously
avoided
and
yet
we
were
making
progress
all
the
time
tacking
across
broad
england
like
an
unweatherly
vessel
on
a
wind
approaching
our
destination
not
openly
but
by
a
sort
of
flying
sap
and
at
length
i
can
scarce
tell
how
we
were
set
down
by
a
dilatory
of
local
train
on
the
untenanted
platform
of
the
town
was
ancient
and
compact
a
domino
of
tiled
houses
and
walled
gardens
dwarfed
by
the
disproportionate
bigness
of
the
church
from
the
midst
of
the
thoroughfare
which
divided
it
in
half
fields
and
trees
were
visible
at
either
end
and
through
the
of
every
street
there
flowed
in
from
the
country
a
silent
invasion
of
green
grass
bees
and
birds
appeared
to
make
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
every
garden
had
its
row
of
hives
the
eaves
of
every
house
were
plastered
with
the
nests
of
swallows
and
the
pinnacles
of
the
church
were
flickered
about
all
day
long
by
a
multitude
of
wings
the
town
was
of
roman
foundation
and
as
i
looked
out
that
afternoon
from
the
low
windows
of
the
inn
i
should
scarce
have
been
surprised
to
see
a
centurion
coming
up
the
street
with
a
fatigue
draft
of
legionaries
in
short
was
one
of
those
towns
which
appear
to
be
maintained
by
england
for
the
instruction
and
delight
of
the
american
rambler
to
which
he
seems
guided
by
an
instinct
not
less
surprising
than
the
setter
and
which
he
visits
and
quits
with
equal
enthusiasm
i
was
not
at
all
in
the
humour
of
the
tourist
i
had
wasted
weeks
of
time
and
accomplished
nothing
we
were
on
the
eve
of
the
engagement
and
i
had
neither
plans
nor
allies
i
had
thrust
myself
into
the
trade
of
private
providence
and
amateur
detective
i
was
spending
money
and
i
was
reaping
disgrace
all
the
time
i
kept
telling
myself
that
i
must
at
least
speak
that
this
ignominious
silence
should
have
been
broken
long
ago
and
must
be
broken
now
i
should
have
broken
it
when
he
first
proposed
to
come
to
i
should
have
broken
it
in
the
train
i
should
break
it
there
and
then
on
the
inn
doorstep
as
the
omnibus
rolled
off
i
turned
toward
him
at
the
thought
he
seemed
to
wince
the
words
died
on
my
lips
and
i
proposed
instead
that
we
should
visit
the
minster
while
we
were
engaged
upon
this
duty
it
came
on
to
rain
in
a
manner
worthy
of
the
tropics
the
vault
reverberated
every
gargoyle
instantly
poured
its
full
discharge
we
waded
back
to
the
inn
in
impromptu
brooks
and
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
sat
weatherbound
hearkening
to
the
sonorous
deluge
for
two
hours
i
talked
of
indifferent
matters
laboriously
feeding
the
conversation
for
two
hours
my
mind
was
quite
made
up
to
do
my
duty
instantly
and
at
each
particular
instant
i
postponed
it
till
the
next
to
screw
up
my
faltering
courage
i
called
at
dinner
for
some
sparkling
wine
it
proved
when
it
came
to
be
detestable
i
could
not
put
it
to
my
lips
and
bellairs
who
had
as
much
palate
as
a
weevil
was
left
to
finish
it
himself
doubtless
the
wine
flushed
him
doubtless
he
may
have
observed
my
embarrassment
of
the
afternoon
doubtless
he
was
conscious
that
we
were
approaching
a
crisis
and
that
that
evening
if
i
did
not
join
with
him
i
must
declare
myself
an
open
enemy
at
least
he
fled
dinner
was
done
this
was
the
time
when
i
had
bound
myself
to
break
my
silence
no
more
delays
were
to
be
allowed
no
more
excuses
received
i
went
upstairs
after
some
tobacco
which
i
felt
to
be
a
mere
necessity
in
the
circumstances
and
when
i
returned
the
man
was
gone
the
waiter
told
me
he
had
left
the
house
the
rain
still
plumped
like
a
vast
over
the
deserted
town
the
night
was
dark
and
windless
the
street
lit
glimmeringly
from
end
to
end
lamps
house
windows
and
the
reflections
in
the
all
contributing
from
a
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
i
heard
a
harp
twang
and
a
doleful
voice
upraised
in
the
watch
anchor
weighed
and
other
naval
ditties
where
had
my
shyster
wandered
in
all
likelihood
to
that
lyrical
tavern
there
was
no
choice
of
diversion
in
comparison
with
on
a
rainy
night
a
sheepfold
would
seem
gay
again
i
passed
in
review
the
points
of
my
interview
on
which
i
was
always
constantly
resolved
so
long
as
my
adversary
was
absent
from
the
scene
and
again
they
struck
me
as
inadequate
from
this
dispiriting
exercise
i
turned
to
the
native
amusements
of
the
inn
and
studied
for
some
time
the
mezzotints
that
frowned
upon
the
wall
the
railway
guide
after
showing
me
how
soon
i
could
leave
stallbridge
and
how
quickly
i
could
reach
paris
failed
to
hold
my
attention
an
illustrated
advertisement
book
of
hotels
brought
me
very
low
indeed
and
when
it
came
to
the
local
paper
i
could
have
wept
at
this
point
i
found
a
passing
solace
in
a
copy
of
whittaker
almanac
and
obtained
in
fifty
minutes
more
information
than
i
have
yet
been
able
to
use
then
a
fresh
apprehension
assailed
me
suppose
bellairs
had
given
me
the
slip
suppose
he
was
now
rolling
on
the
road
to
or
perhaps
there
already
and
laying
before
a
very
auditor
his
threats
and
propositions
a
hasty
person
might
have
instantly
pursued
whatever
i
am
i
am
not
hasty
and
i
was
aware
of
three
grave
objections
in
the
first
place
i
could
not
be
certain
that
bellairs
was
gone
in
the
second
i
had
no
taste
whatever
for
a
long
drive
at
that
hour
of
the
night
and
in
so
merciless
a
rain
in
the
third
i
had
no
idea
how
i
was
to
get
admitted
if
i
went
and
no
idea
what
i
should
say
if
i
got
admitted
short
i
concluded
whole
situation
is
the
merest
farce
you
have
thrust
yourself
in
where
you
had
no
business
and
have
no
power
you
would
be
quite
as
useful
in
san
francisco
far
happier
in
paris
and
being
by
the
wrath
of
god
at
the
wisest
thing
is
to
go
quietly
to
on
the
way
to
my
room
i
saw
in
a
flash
that
which
i
ought
to
have
done
long
ago
and
which
it
was
now
too
late
to
think
of
written
to
carthew
i
mean
detailing
the
facts
and
describing
bellairs
letting
him
defend
himself
if
he
were
able
and
giving
him
time
to
flee
if
he
were
not
it
was
the
last
blow
to
my
and
i
flung
myself
into
my
bed
with
contumely
i
have
no
guess
what
hour
it
was
when
i
was
wakened
by
the
entrance
of
bellairs
carrying
a
candle
he
had
been
drunk
for
he
was
bedaubed
with
mire
from
head
to
foot
but
he
was
now
sober
and
under
the
empire
of
some
violent
emotion
which
he
controlled
with
difficulty
he
trembled
visibly
and
more
than
once
during
the
interview
which
followed
tears
suddenly
and
silently
overflowed
his
cheeks
have
to
ask
your
pardon
sir
for
this
untimely
visit
he
said
make
no
defence
i
have
no
excuse
i
have
disgraced
myself
i
am
properly
punished
i
appear
before
you
to
appeal
to
you
in
mercy
for
the
most
trifling
aid
or
god
help
me
i
fear
i
may
go
on
earth
is
wrong
i
asked
have
been
robbed
he
said
have
no
defence
to
offer
it
was
of
my
own
fault
i
am
properly
gracious
goodness
me
i
cried
is
there
to
rob
you
in
a
place
like
this
can
form
no
opinion
he
replied
have
no
idea
i
was
lying
in
a
ditch
inanimate
this
is
a
degrading
confession
sir
i
can
only
say
in
that
perhaps
in
your
good
nature
you
have
made
yourself
partly
responsible
for
my
shame
i
am
not
used
to
these
rich
what
form
was
your
money
perhaps
it
may
be
traced
i
suggested
was
in
english
sovereigns
i
changed
it
in
new
york
i
got
very
good
exchange
he
said
and
then
with
a
momentary
outbreak
in
heaven
how
i
toiled
for
it
he
cried
does
sound
encouraging
said
i
may
be
worth
while
to
apply
to
the
police
but
it
does
sound
a
hopeful
i
have
no
hope
in
that
direction
said
bellairs
hopes
dodd
are
all
fixed
upon
yourself
i
could
easily
convince
you
that
a
small
a
very
small
advance
would
be
in
the
nature
of
an
excellent
investment
but
i
prefer
to
rely
on
your
humanity
our
acquaintance
began
on
an
unusual
footing
but
you
have
now
known
me
for
some
time
we
have
been
some
time
i
was
going
to
say
we
had
been
almost
intimate
under
the
impulse
of
instinctive
sympathy
i
have
bared
my
heart
to
you
dodd
as
i
have
done
to
few
and
i
believe
i
trust
i
may
say
that
i
feel
sure
you
heard
me
with
a
kindly
sentiment
this
is
what
brings
me
to
your
side
at
this
most
inexcusable
hour
but
put
yourself
in
my
place
how
could
i
sleep
how
could
i
dream
of
sleeping
in
this
blackness
of
remorse
and
despair
there
was
a
friend
at
hand
so
i
ventured
to
think
of
you
it
was
instinctive
i
fled
to
your
side
as
the
drowning
man
clutches
at
a
straw
these
expressions
are
not
exaggerated
they
scarcely
serve
to
express
the
agitation
of
my
mind
and
think
sir
how
easily
you
can
restore
me
to
hope
and
i
may
say
to
reason
a
small
loan
which
shall
be
faithfully
repaid
five
hundred
dollars
would
be
he
watched
me
with
burning
eyes
hundred
would
do
i
believe
dodd
that
i
could
manage
with
economy
on
then
you
will
repay
me
out
of
carthew
pocket
i
said
am
much
obliged
but
i
will
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
will
see
you
on
board
a
steamer
pay
your
fare
through
to
san
francisco
and
place
fifty
dollars
in
the
purser
hands
to
be
given
you
in
new
he
drank
in
my
words
his
face
represented
an
ecstasy
of
cunning
thought
i
could
read
there
plain
as
print
that
he
but
thought
to
overreach
me
what
am
i
to
do
in
he
asked
am
disbarred
i
have
no
trade
i
can
not
dig
to
beg
he
paused
in
the
citation
you
know
that
i
am
not
alone
he
added
depend
upon
will
write
to
pinkerton
i
returned
feel
sure
he
can
help
you
to
some
employment
and
in
the
meantime
and
for
three
months
after
your
arrival
he
shall
pay
to
yourself
personally
on
the
first
and
the
fifteenth
dodd
i
scarce
believe
you
can
be
serious
in
this
offer
he
replied
you
forgotten
the
circumstances
of
the
case
do
you
know
these
people
are
the
magnates
of
the
section
they
were
spoken
of
in
the
saloon
their
wealth
must
amount
to
many
millions
of
dollars
in
real
estate
alone
their
house
is
one
of
the
sights
of
the
locality
and
you
offer
me
a
bribe
of
a
few
hundred
offer
you
no
bribe
bellairs
i
give
you
alms
i
returned
will
do
nothing
to
forward
you
in
your
hateful
business
yet
i
would
not
willingly
have
you
me
a
hundred
dollars
then
and
be
done
with
it
he
cried
will
do
what
i
have
said
and
neither
more
nor
less
said
i
care
he
cried
are
playing
a
fool
game
you
are
making
an
enemy
for
nothing
you
will
gain
nothing
by
this
i
warn
you
of
it
and
then
with
one
of
his
changes
dollars
only
seventy
in
mercy
dodd
in
common
charity
do
dash
the
bowl
from
my
lips
you
have
a
kindly
heart
think
of
my
position
remember
my
unhappy
should
have
thought
of
her
before
said
i
have
made
my
offer
and
i
wish
to
that
your
last
word
sir
pray
consider
pray
weigh
both
sides
my
misery
your
own
danger
i
warn
you
i
beseech
you
measure
it
well
before
you
answer
so
he
half
pleaded
half
threatened
me
with
clasped
hands
first
word
and
my
last
said
i
the
change
upon
the
man
was
shocking
in
the
storm
of
anger
that
now
shook
him
the
lees
of
his
intoxication
rose
again
to
the
surface
his
face
was
deformed
his
words
insane
with
fury
his
pantomime
excessive
in
itself
was
distorted
by
an
access
of
vitus
will
perhaps
allow
me
to
inform
you
of
my
cold
opinion
he
began
apparently
truly
bursting
with
rage
i
am
a
glorified
saint
i
shall
see
you
howling
for
a
drop
of
water
and
exult
to
see
you
that
your
last
word
take
it
in
your
face
you
spy
you
false
friend
you
fat
hypocrite
i
defy
i
defy
and
despise
and
spit
upon
you
i
on
the
trail
his
trail
or
yours
i
smell
blood
follow
it
on
my
hands
and
knees
i
starve
to
follow
it
i
hunt
you
down
hunt
you
hunt
you
down
if
i
were
strong
i
tear
your
vitals
out
here
in
this
room
tear
them
out
i
tear
them
out
damn
damn
damn
you
think
me
weak
i
can
bite
bite
to
the
blood
bite
you
hurt
you
disgrace
you
he
was
thus
incoherently
raging
when
the
scene
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
the
landlord
and
inn
servants
in
various
degrees
of
deshabille
and
to
them
i
gave
my
temporary
lunatic
in
charge
him
to
his
room
i
said
only
these
were
my
words
but
i
knew
better
after
all
my
study
of
bellairs
one
discovery
had
been
reserved
for
the
last
moment
that
of
his
latent
and
essential
madness
chapter
xx
long
before
i
was
awake
the
shyster
had
disappeared
leaving
his
bill
unpaid
i
did
not
need
to
inquire
where
he
was
gone
i
knew
too
well
i
knew
there
was
nothing
left
me
but
to
follow
and
about
ten
in
the
morning
set
forth
in
a
gig
for
the
road
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
way
deserts
the
valley
of
the
river
and
crosses
the
summit
of
a
grazed
over
by
flocks
of
sheep
and
haunted
by
innumerable
larks
it
was
a
pleasant
but
a
vacant
scene
arousing
but
not
holding
the
attention
and
my
mind
returned
to
the
violent
passage
of
the
night
before
my
thought
of
the
man
i
was
pursuing
had
been
greatly
changed
i
conceived
of
him
somewhere
in
front
of
me
upon
his
dangerous
errand
not
to
be
turned
aside
not
to
be
stopped
by
either
fear
or
reason
i
had
called
him
a
ferret
i
conceived
him
now
as
a
mad
dog
methought
he
would
run
not
walk
methought
as
he
ran
that
he
would
bark
and
froth
at
the
lips
methought
if
the
great
wall
of
china
were
to
rise
across
his
path
he
would
attack
it
with
his
nails
presently
the
road
left
the
down
returned
by
a
precipitous
descent
into
the
valley
of
the
stall
and
ran
thenceforward
among
enclosed
fields
and
under
the
continuous
shade
of
trees
i
was
told
we
had
now
entered
on
the
carthew
property
by
and
by
a
battlemented
wall
appeared
on
the
left
hand
and
a
little
after
i
had
my
first
glimpse
of
the
mansion
it
stood
in
a
hollow
of
a
bosky
park
crowded
to
a
degree
that
surprised
and
even
displeased
me
with
huge
timber
and
dense
shrubberies
of
laurel
and
rhododendron
even
from
this
low
station
and
the
thronging
neighbourhood
of
the
trees
the
pile
rose
conspicuous
like
a
cathedral
behind
as
we
continued
to
skirt
the
park
wall
i
began
to
make
out
a
straggling
town
of
offices
which
became
conjoined
to
the
rear
with
those
of
the
home
farm
on
the
left
was
an
ornamental
water
sailed
in
by
many
swans
on
the
right
extended
a
flower
garden
laid
in
the
old
manner
and
at
this
season
of
the
year
as
brilliant
as
stained
glass
the
front
of
the
house
presented
a
facade
of
more
than
sixty
windows
surmounted
by
a
formal
pediment
and
raised
upon
a
terrace
a
wide
avenue
part
in
gravel
part
in
turf
and
bordered
by
triple
alleys
ran
to
the
great
double
gateways
it
was
impossible
to
look
without
surprise
on
a
place
that
had
been
prepared
through
so
many
generations
had
cost
so
many
tons
of
minted
gold
and
was
maintained
in
order
by
so
great
a
company
of
emulous
servants
and
yet
of
these
there
was
no
sign
but
the
perfection
of
their
work
the
whole
domain
was
drawn
to
the
line
and
weeded
like
the
front
plot
of
some
suburban
amateur
and
i
looked
in
vain
for
any
belated
gardener
and
listened
in
vain
for
any
sounds
of
labour
some
lowing
of
cattle
and
much
calling
of
birds
alone
disturbed
the
stillness
and
even
the
little
hamlet
which
clustered
at
the
gates
appeared
to
hold
its
breath
in
awe
of
its
great
neighbour
like
a
troop
of
children
who
should
have
strayed
into
a
king
anteroom
the
carthew
arms
the
small
but
very
comfortable
inn
was
a
mere
appendage
and
outpost
of
the
family
whose
name
it
bore
engraved
portraits
of
carthews
adorned
the
walls
fielding
carthew
recorder
of
the
city
of
london
john
carthew
in
uniform
commanding
some
military
operations
the
right
honourable
bailley
carthew
member
of
parliament
for
stallbridge
standing
by
a
table
and
brandishing
a
document
singleton
carthew
esquire
represented
in
the
foreground
of
a
herd
of
cattle
doubtless
at
the
desire
of
his
tenantry
who
had
made
him
a
compliment
of
this
work
of
art
and
the
venerable
archdeacon
carthew
laying
his
hand
on
the
head
of
a
little
child
in
a
manner
highly
frigid
and
ridiculous
so
far
as
my
memory
serves
me
there
were
no
other
pictures
in
this
exclusive
hostelry
and
i
was
not
surprised
to
learn
that
the
landlord
was
an
the
landlady
an
from
the
great
house
and
that
the
was
a
sort
of
perquisite
of
former
servants
to
an
american
the
sense
of
the
domination
of
this
family
over
so
considerable
a
tract
of
earth
was
even
oppressive
and
as
i
considered
their
simple
annals
gathered
from
the
legends
of
the
engravings
surprise
began
to
mingle
with
my
disgust
doubtless
occupies
an
honourable
post
but
i
thought
that
in
the
course
of
so
many
generations
one
carthew
might
have
clambered
higher
the
soldier
had
stuck
at
the
churchman
bloomed
unremarked
in
an
archidiaconate
and
though
the
right
honourable
bailley
seemed
to
have
sneaked
into
the
privy
council
i
have
still
to
learn
what
he
did
when
he
had
got
there
such
vast
means
so
long
a
start
and
such
a
modest
standard
of
achievement
struck
in
me
a
strong
sense
of
the
dulness
of
that
race
i
found
that
to
come
to
the
hamlet
and
not
visit
the
hall
would
be
regarded
as
a
slight
to
feed
the
swans
to
see
the
peacocks
and
the
raphaels
for
these
commonplace
people
actually
possessed
two
raphaels
to
risk
life
and
limb
among
a
famous
breed
of
cattle
called
the
carthew
chillinghams
and
to
do
homage
to
the
sire
still
living
of
donibristle
a
renowned
winner
of
the
oaks
these
it
seemed
were
the
inevitable
stations
of
the
pilgrimage
i
was
not
so
foolish
as
to
resist
for
i
might
have
need
before
i
was
done
of
general
and
two
pieces
of
news
fell
in
which
changed
my
resignation
to
alacrity
it
appeared
in
the
first
place
that
norris
was
from
home
in
the
second
that
a
visitor
had
been
before
me
and
already
made
the
tour
of
the
carthew
curiosities
i
thought
i
knew
who
this
must
be
i
was
anxious
to
learn
what
he
had
done
and
seen
and
fortune
so
far
favoured
me
that
the
singled
out
to
be
my
guide
had
already
performed
the
same
function
for
my
predecessor
sir
he
said
american
gentleman
right
enough
at
least
i
do
think
he
was
quite
a
gentleman
but
a
very
civil
the
person
it
seems
had
been
civil
enough
to
be
delighted
with
the
carthew
chillinghams
to
perform
the
whole
pilgrimage
with
rising
admiration
and
to
have
almost
prostrated
himself
before
the
shrine
of
donibristle
sire
told
me
sir
continued
the
gratified
he
had
often
read
of
the
of
england
but
ours
was
the
first
he
had
the
chance
to
see
when
he
came
to
the
of
the
long
alley
he
fetched
his
breath
is
indeed
a
lordly
domain
he
cries
and
it
was
natural
he
should
be
interested
in
the
place
for
it
seems
carthew
had
been
kind
to
him
in
the
states
in
fact
he
seemed
a
grateful
kind
of
person
and
wonderful
taken
up
with
i
heard
this
story
with
amazement
the
phrases
quoted
told
their
own
tale
they
were
plainly
from
the
shyster
mint
a
few
hours
back
i
had
seen
him
a
mere
bedlamite
and
fit
for
a
he
was
penniless
in
a
strange
country
it
was
highly
probable
he
had
gone
without
breakfast
the
absence
of
norris
must
have
been
a
crushing
blow
the
man
by
all
reason
should
have
been
despairing
and
now
i
heard
of
him
clothed
and
in
his
right
mind
deliberate
insinuating
admiring
vistas
smelling
flowers
and
talking
like
a
book
the
strength
of
character
implied
amazed
and
daunted
me
is
curious
i
said
to
the
have
had
the
pleasure
of
some
acquaintance
with
carthew
myself
and
i
believe
none
of
our
western
friends
ever
were
in
england
who
can
this
person
be
he
could
no
that
impossible
he
could
never
have
had
the
impudence
his
name
was
not
bellairs
did
the
name
sir
do
you
know
anything
against
him
cried
my
guide
said
i
is
certainly
not
the
person
carthew
would
like
to
have
here
in
his
gracious
me
exclaimed
the
gardener
was
so
pleasant
spoken
too
i
thought
he
was
some
form
of
a
schoolmaster
perhaps
sir
you
would
mind
going
right
up
to
denman
i
recommended
him
to
denman
when
he
had
done
the
grounds
denman
is
our
butler
sir
he
added
the
proposal
was
welcome
particularly
as
affording
me
a
graceful
retreat
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
carthew
chillinghams
and
giving
up
our
projected
circuit
we
took
a
short
cut
through
the
shrubbery
and
across
the
bowling
green
to
the
back
quarters
of
the
hall
the
bowling
green
was
surrounded
by
a
great
hedge
of
yew
and
entered
by
an
archway
in
the
quick
as
we
were
issuing
from
this
passage
my
conductor
arrested
me
honourable
lady
ann
carthew
he
said
in
an
august
whisper
and
looking
over
his
shoulder
i
was
aware
of
an
old
lady
with
a
stick
hobbling
somewhat
briskly
along
the
garden
path
she
must
have
been
extremely
handsome
in
her
youth
and
even
the
limp
with
which
she
walked
could
not
deprive
her
of
an
unusual
and
almost
menacing
dignity
of
bearing
melancholy
was
impressed
besides
on
every
feature
and
her
eyes
as
she
looked
straight
before
her
seemed
to
contemplate
misfortune
seems
sad
said
i
when
she
had
hobbled
past
and
we
had
resumed
our
walk
enjoy
rather
poor
spirits
sir
responded
the
carthew
the
old
gentleman
i
mean
died
less
than
a
year
ago
lord
tillibody
her
ladyship
brother
two
months
after
and
then
there
was
the
sad
business
about
the
young
gentleman
killed
in
the
sir
and
her
ladyship
favourite
the
present
norris
has
never
been
so
i
have
understood
said
i
persistently
and
i
think
gracefully
pursuing
my
inquiries
and
fortifying
my
position
as
a
family
friend
dear
how
sad
and
has
this
change
poor
carthew
return
and
all
has
this
not
mended
matters
no
sir
not
a
sign
of
it
was
the
reply
we
think
than
dear
said
i
again
norris
arrived
she
did
seem
glad
to
see
him
he
pursued
we
were
all
pleased
i
sure
for
no
one
knows
the
young
gentleman
but
what
likes
him
ah
sir
it
did
last
long
that
very
night
they
had
a
talk
and
fell
out
or
something
her
ladyship
took
on
most
painful
it
was
like
old
days
but
worse
and
the
next
morning
norris
was
off
again
upon
his
travels
he
said
to
denman
i
never
come
back
he
said
and
shook
him
by
the
i
would
be
saying
all
this
to
a
stranger
sir
added
my
informant
overcome
with
a
sudden
fear
lest
he
had
gone
too
far
he
had
indeed
told
me
much
and
much
that
was
unsuspected
by
himself
on
that
stormy
night
of
his
return
carthew
had
told
his
story
the
old
lady
had
more
upon
her
mind
than
mere
bereavements
and
among
the
mental
pictures
on
which
she
looked
as
she
walked
staring
down
the
path
was
one
of
midway
island
and
the
flying
scud
denman
heard
my
inquiries
with
discomposure
but
informed
me
the
shyster
was
already
gone
cried
i
what
can
he
have
come
for
one
thing
i
can
tell
you
it
was
not
to
see
the
do
see
it
could
have
been
anything
else
replied
the
butler
may
depend
upon
it
it
was
said
i
whatever
it
was
he
has
got
it
by
the
way
where
is
carthew
at
present
i
was
sorry
to
find
he
was
from
is
engaged
in
travelling
sir
replied
the
butler
dryly
bravo
cried
i
laid
a
trap
for
you
there
denman
now
i
need
not
ask
you
i
am
sure
you
did
not
tell
this
prying
be
sure
not
sir
said
the
butler
i
went
through
the
form
of
him
by
the
like
norris
not
however
with
genuine
enthusiasm
for
i
had
failed
ingloriously
to
get
the
address
for
myself
and
i
felt
a
sure
conviction
that
bellairs
had
done
better
or
he
had
still
been
here
and
still
cultivating
denman
i
had
escaped
the
grounds
and
the
cattle
i
could
not
escape
the
house
a
lady
with
silver
hair
a
slender
silver
voice
and
a
stream
of
insignificant
information
not
to
be
diverted
led
me
through
the
picture
gallery
the
the
great
the
long
the
indian
room
the
theatre
and
every
corner
as
i
thought
of
that
interminable
mansion
there
was
but
one
place
reserved
the
whither
lady
ann
had
now
retired
i
paused
a
moment
on
the
outside
of
the
door
and
smiled
to
myself
the
situation
was
indeed
strange
and
these
thin
boards
divided
the
secret
of
the
flying
scud
all
the
while
as
i
went
to
and
fro
i
was
considering
the
visit
and
departure
of
bellairs
that
he
had
got
the
address
i
was
quite
certain
that
he
had
not
got
it
by
direct
questioning
i
was
convinced
some
ingenuity
some
lucky
accident
had
served
him
a
similar
chance
an
equal
ingenuity
was
required
or
i
was
left
helpless
the
ferret
must
run
down
his
prey
the
great
oaks
fall
the
raphaels
be
scattered
the
house
let
to
some
stockbroker
suddenly
made
rich
and
the
name
which
now
filled
the
mouths
of
five
or
six
parishes
dwindle
to
a
memory
strange
that
such
great
matters
so
old
a
mansion
a
family
so
ancient
and
so
dull
should
come
to
depend
for
perpetuity
upon
the
intelligence
the
discretion
and
the
cunning
of
a
student
what
bellairs
had
done
i
must
do
likewise
chance
or
ingenuity
ingenuity
or
chance
so
i
continued
to
ring
the
changes
as
i
walked
down
the
avenue
casting
back
occasional
glances
at
the
red
brick
facade
and
the
twinkling
windows
of
the
house
how
was
i
to
command
chance
where
was
i
to
find
the
ingenuity
these
reflections
brought
me
to
the
door
of
the
inn
and
here
pursuant
to
my
policy
of
keeping
well
with
all
men
i
immediately
smoothed
my
brow
and
accepted
being
the
only
guest
in
the
house
an
invitation
to
dine
with
the
family
in
the
i
sat
down
accordingly
with
higgs
the
higgs
the
and
miss
agnes
higgs
their
little
girl
the
least
promising
and
as
the
event
showed
the
most
useful
of
the
lot
the
talk
ran
endlessly
on
the
great
house
and
the
great
family
the
roast
beef
the
yorkshire
pudding
the
and
the
cheddar
cheese
came
and
went
and
still
the
stream
flowed
on
near
four
generations
of
carthews
were
touched
upon
without
eliciting
one
point
of
interest
and
we
had
killed
henry
in
with
a
vast
elaboration
of
painful
circumstance
and
buried
him
in
the
midst
of
a
whole
sorrowing
county
before
i
could
so
much
as
manage
to
bring
upon
the
stage
my
intimate
friend
norris
at
the
name
the
grew
diplomatic
and
the
tender
he
was
the
only
person
of
the
whole
featureless
series
who
seemed
to
have
accomplished
anything
worth
mention
and
his
achievements
poor
dog
seemed
to
have
been
confined
to
going
to
the
devil
and
leaving
some
regrets
he
had
been
the
image
of
the
right
honourable
bailley
one
of
the
lights
of
that
dim
house
and
a
career
of
distinction
had
been
predicted
of
him
in
consequence
almost
from
the
cradle
but
before
he
was
out
of
long
clothes
the
cloven
foot
began
to
show
he
proved
to
be
no
carthew
developed
a
taste
for
low
pleasures
and
bad
company
went
birdnesting
with
a
before
he
was
eleven
and
when
he
was
near
twenty
and
might
have
been
expected
to
display
at
least
some
rudiments
of
the
family
gravity
rambled
the
country
over
with
a
knapsack
making
sketches
and
keeping
company
in
wayside
inns
he
had
no
pride
about
him
i
was
told
he
would
sit
down
with
any
man
and
it
was
somewhat
woundingly
implied
that
i
was
indebted
to
this
peculiarity
for
my
own
acquaintance
with
the
hero
unhappily
norris
was
not
only
eccentric
he
was
fast
his
debts
were
still
remembered
at
the
university
still
more
it
appeared
the
highly
humorous
circumstances
attending
his
expulsion
was
always
fond
of
his
jest
commented
higgs
he
were
observed
her
lord
but
it
was
after
he
went
into
the
diplomatic
service
that
the
real
trouble
began
seems
sir
that
he
went
the
pace
extraordinary
said
the
with
a
solemn
gusto
debts
were
somethink
awful
said
the
as
nice
a
young
gentleman
all
the
time
as
you
would
wish
to
see
word
came
to
carthew
ears
the
turn
up
was
continued
higgs
remember
it
as
if
it
was
yesterday
the
bell
was
rung
after
her
was
gone
which
i
answered
it
myself
supposing
it
were
the
coffee
there
was
carthew
on
his
feet
iggs
he
says
pointing
with
his
stick
for
he
had
a
turn
of
the
gout
the
instantly
for
this
son
of
mine
which
has
disgraced
hisself
norris
say
nothink
he
sit
there
with
his
down
making
belief
to
be
looking
at
a
walnut
you
might
have
bowled
me
over
with
a
straw
said
higgs
he
done
anything
very
bad
i
asked
he
dodsley
cried
the
lady
it
was
so
she
had
conceived
my
name
never
did
anythink
to
all
really
wrong
in
his
poor
life
the
affair
was
a
disgrace
it
was
all
rank
cried
the
butler
warningly
what
do
i
care
retorted
the
lady
shaking
her
ringlets
know
it
was
yourself
and
so
did
every
member
of
the
while
i
was
getting
these
facts
and
opinions
i
by
no
means
neglected
the
child
she
was
not
attractive
but
fortunately
she
had
reached
the
corrupt
age
of
seven
when
half
a
crown
appears
about
as
large
as
a
saucer
and
is
fully
as
rare
as
the
dodo
for
a
shilling
down
sixpence
in
her
and
an
american
gold
dollar
which
i
happened
to
find
in
my
pocket
i
bought
the
creature
soul
and
body
she
declared
her
intention
to
accompany
me
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
had
to
be
chidden
by
her
sire
for
drawing
comparisons
between
myself
and
her
uncle
william
highly
damaging
to
the
latter
dinner
was
scarce
done
the
cloth
was
not
yet
removed
when
miss
agnes
must
needs
climb
into
my
lap
with
her
stamp
album
a
relic
of
the
generosity
of
uncle
william
there
are
few
things
i
despise
more
than
old
stamps
unless
perhaps
it
be
crests
for
cattle
from
the
carthew
chillinghams
down
to
the
old
in
the
lane
contempt
is
far
from
being
my
first
sentiment
but
it
seemed
i
was
doomed
to
pass
that
day
in
viewing
curiosities
and
smothering
a
yawn
i
devoted
myself
once
more
to
tread
the
round
i
fancy
uncle
william
must
have
begun
the
collection
himself
and
tired
of
it
for
the
book
to
my
surprise
was
quite
respectably
filled
there
were
the
varying
shades
of
the
english
penny
russians
with
the
coloured
heart
old
undecipherable
obsolete
triangular
cape
of
good
hopes
swan
rivers
with
the
swan
and
guianas
with
the
sailing
ship
upon
all
these
i
looked
with
the
eyes
of
a
fish
and
the
spirit
of
a
sheep
i
think
indeed
i
was
at
times
asleep
and
it
was
probably
in
one
of
these
moments
that
i
capsized
the
album
and
there
fell
from
the
end
of
it
upon
the
floor
a
considerable
number
of
what
i
believe
to
be
called
here
against
all
probability
my
chance
had
come
to
me
for
as
i
gallantly
picked
them
up
i
was
struck
with
the
disproportionate
amount
of
french
stamps
some
one
i
reasoned
must
write
very
regularly
from
france
to
the
neighbourhood
of
could
it
be
norris
on
one
stamp
i
made
out
an
initial
c
upon
a
second
i
got
as
far
as
ch
beyond
which
point
the
postmark
used
was
in
every
instance
undecipherable
ch
when
you
consider
that
about
a
quarter
of
the
towns
in
france
begin
with
was
an
insufficient
clue
and
i
promptly
annexed
the
plainest
of
the
collection
in
order
to
consult
the
the
wretched
infant
took
me
in
the
fact
man
to
my
she
cried
and
when
i
would
have
brazened
it
off
with
a
denial
recovered
and
displayed
the
stolen
article
my
position
was
now
highly
false
and
i
believe
it
was
in
mere
pity
that
higgs
came
to
my
rescue
with
a
welcome
proposition
if
the
gentleman
was
really
interested
in
stamps
she
said
probably
supposing
me
a
monomaniac
on
the
point
he
should
see
denman
album
denman
had
been
collecting
forty
years
and
his
collection
was
said
to
be
worth
a
mint
of
money
she
went
on
you
were
a
kind
little
girl
you
would
run
over
to
the
tell
denman
a
connaisseer
in
the
and
ask
him
if
one
of
the
young
gentlemen
might
bring
the
album
should
like
to
see
his
exchanges
too
i
cried
rising
to
the
occasion
may
have
some
of
mine
in
my
and
we
might
half
an
hour
later
denman
arrived
himself
with
a
most
unconscionable
volume
under
his
arm
sir
he
cried
i
you
was
a
collector
i
dropped
all
it
a
saying
of
mine
dodsley
that
collecting
stamps
makes
all
collectors
kin
it
a
bond
sir
it
creates
a
upon
the
truth
of
this
i
can
not
say
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
attempt
to
pass
yourself
off
for
a
collector
falsely
creates
a
precarious
situation
here
the
second
issue
i
would
say
after
consulting
the
legend
at
the
side
pink
no
i
mean
the
mauve
yes
that
the
beauty
of
this
lot
though
of
course
as
you
say
i
would
hasten
to
add
yellow
on
the
thin
paper
is
more
indeed
i
must
certainly
have
been
detected
had
i
not
plied
denman
in
with
his
favourite
liquor
a
port
so
excellent
that
it
could
never
have
ripened
in
the
cellar
of
the
carthew
arms
but
must
have
been
transported
under
cloud
of
night
from
the
neighbouring
vaults
of
the
great
house
at
each
threat
of
exposure
and
in
particular
whenever
i
was
directly
challenged
for
an
opinion
i
made
haste
to
fill
the
butler
glass
and
by
the
time
we
had
got
to
the
exchanges
he
was
in
a
condition
in
which
no
stamp
collector
need
be
seriously
feared
god
forbid
i
should
hint
that
he
was
drunk
he
seemed
incapable
of
the
necessary
liveliness
but
the
man
eyes
were
set
and
so
long
as
he
was
suffered
to
talk
without
interruption
he
seemed
careless
of
my
heeding
him
in
denman
exchanges
as
in
those
of
little
agnes
the
same
peculiarity
was
to
be
remarked
an
undue
preponderance
of
that
despicably
common
stamp
the
french
centimes
and
here
joining
them
in
stealthy
review
i
found
the
c
and
the
ch
then
something
of
an
a
just
following
and
then
a
terminal
y
here
was
also
the
whole
name
spelt
out
to
me
it
seemed
familiar
too
and
yet
for
some
time
i
could
not
bridge
the
imperfection
then
i
came
upon
another
stamp
in
which
an
l
was
legible
before
the
y
and
in
a
moment
the
word
leaped
up
complete
chailly
that
was
the
name
the
post
town
of
barbizon
ah
there
was
the
very
place
for
any
man
to
hide
himself
there
was
the
very
place
for
norris
who
had
rambled
over
england
making
sketches
the
very
place
for
goddedaal
who
had
left
a
on
board
the
flying
scud
singular
indeed
that
while
i
was
drifting
over
england
with
the
shyster
the
man
we
were
in
quest
of
awaited
me
at
my
own
ultimate
destination
whether
denman
had
shown
his
album
to
bellairs
whether
indeed
bellairs
could
have
caught
as
i
did
this
hint
from
an
obliterated
postmark
i
shall
never
know
and
it
mattered
not
we
were
equal
now
my
task
at
was
accomplished
my
interest
in
died
shamelessly
away
the
astonished
denman
was
bowed
out
and
ordering
the
horse
to
be
put
in
i
plunged
into
the
study
of
the
chapter
xxi
face
to
face
i
fell
from
the
skies
on
barbizon
about
two
of
a
september
afternoon
it
is
the
dead
hour
of
the
day
all
the
workers
have
gone
painting
all
the
idlers
strolling
in
the
forest
or
the
plain
the
winding
causewayed
street
is
solitary
and
the
inn
deserted
i
was
the
more
pleased
to
find
one
of
my
old
companions
in
the
his
town
clothes
marked
him
for
a
man
in
the
act
of
departure
and
indeed
his
portmanteau
lay
beside
him
on
the
floor
stennis
i
cried
the
last
man
i
expected
to
find
wo
find
me
here
long
he
replied
pandion
he
is
dead
all
his
friends
are
lapped
in
lead
for
men
of
our
antiquity
the
poor
old
shop
is
played
have
had
playmates
i
have
had
companions
i
quoted
in
return
we
were
both
moved
i
think
to
meet
again
in
this
scene
of
our
old
pleasure
parties
so
unexpectedly
after
so
long
an
interval
and
both
already
so
much
altered
is
the
sentiment
he
replied
all
are
gone
the
old
familiar
faces
i
have
been
here
a
week
and
the
only
living
creature
who
seemed
to
recollect
me
was
the
pharaon
bar
the
sirons
of
course
and
the
perennial
there
no
survivor
i
inquired
our
geological
epoch
not
one
he
replied
is
the
city
of
petra
in
what
sort
of
bedouins
encamp
among
the
ruins
i
asked
dodd
youth
blooming
conscious
youth
he
returned
a
gang
such
reptiles
to
think
we
were
like
that
i
wonder
siron
sweep
us
from
his
we
were
so
bad
i
suggested
let
me
depress
you
said
he
were
both
anyway
and
the
only
redeeming
feature
is
the
thought
of
my
quest
a
moment
driven
out
by
this
rencounter
revived
in
my
mind
is
he
i
cried
me
about
the
redeeming
feature
said
he
he
a
very
pleasing
creature
rather
dim
and
dull
and
genteel
but
really
pleasing
he
is
very
british
though
the
artless
briton
perhaps
you
find
him
too
much
so
for
the
transatlantic
nerves
come
to
think
of
it
on
the
other
hand
you
ought
to
get
on
famously
he
is
an
admirer
of
your
great
republic
in
one
of
its
excuse
me
shoddiest
features
he
takes
in
and
sedulously
reads
a
lot
of
american
papers
i
warned
you
he
was
papers
are
they
cried
i
francisco
papers
said
he
gets
a
bale
of
them
about
twice
a
week
and
studies
them
like
the
bible
that
one
of
his
weaknesses
another
is
to
be
incalculably
rich
he
has
taken
masson
old
studio
you
remember
at
the
corner
of
the
road
he
has
furnished
it
regardless
of
expense
and
lives
there
surrounded
with
vins
fins
and
works
of
art
when
the
youth
of
goes
up
to
the
caverne
des
brigands
to
make
punch
they
do
all
that
we
did
like
some
nauseous
form
of
ape
i
never
appreciated
before
what
a
creature
of
tradition
mankind
is
this
madden
follows
with
a
basket
of
champagne
i
told
him
he
was
wrong
and
the
punch
tasted
better
but
he
thought
the
boys
liked
the
style
of
the
thing
and
i
suppose
they
do
he
is
a
very
soul
and
a
very
melancholy
and
rather
a
helpless
o
and
he
has
a
third
weakness
which
i
came
near
forgetting
he
paints
he
has
never
been
taught
and
he
past
thirty
and
he
i
asked
well
i
think
was
the
reply
the
annoying
part
of
it
see
for
yourself
that
panel
is
i
stepped
toward
the
window
it
was
the
old
familiar
room
with
the
tables
set
like
a
greek
p
and
the
sideboard
and
the
aphasiac
piano
and
the
panels
on
the
wall
there
were
romeo
and
juliet
antwerp
from
the
river
enfield
ships
among
the
ice
and
the
huge
huntsman
winding
a
huge
horn
mingled
with
them
a
few
new
ones
the
thin
crop
of
a
succeeding
generation
not
better
and
not
worse
it
was
to
one
of
these
i
was
directed
a
thing
coarsely
and
wittily
handled
mostly
with
the
the
colour
in
some
parts
excellent
the
canvas
in
others
loaded
with
mere
clay
but
it
was
the
scene
and
not
the
art
or
want
of
it
that
riveted
my
notice
the
foreground
was
of
sand
and
scrub
and
wreckwood
in
the
middle
distance
the
and
smooth
expanse
of
a
lagoon
enclosed
by
a
wall
of
breakers
beyond
a
blue
strip
of
ocean
the
sky
was
cloudless
and
i
could
hear
the
surf
break
for
the
place
was
midway
island
the
point
of
view
the
very
spot
at
which
i
had
landed
with
the
captain
for
the
first
time
and
from
which
i
had
the
day
before
we
sailed
i
had
already
been
gazing
for
some
seconds
before
my
attention
was
arrested
by
a
blur
on
the
and
stooping
to
look
i
recognised
the
smoke
of
a
steamer
said
i
turning
toward
stennis
has
merit
what
is
it
fancy
piece
he
returned
what
pleased
me
so
few
of
the
fellows
in
our
time
had
the
imagination
of
a
garden
you
say
his
name
is
i
pursued
he
repeated
he
travelled
much
i
inquired
have
an
idea
he
is
one
of
the
least
autobiographical
of
men
he
sits
and
smokes
and
giggles
and
sometimes
he
makes
small
jests
but
his
contributions
to
the
art
of
pleasing
are
generally
confined
to
looking
like
a
gentleman
and
being
one
no
added
stennis
never
suit
you
dodd
you
like
more
head
on
your
liquor
you
find
him
as
dull
as
ditch
he
big
blonde
like
tusks
i
asked
mindful
of
the
photograph
of
goddedaal
not
why
should
he
was
the
reply
he
write
many
letters
i
continued
knows
said
stennis
is
wrong
with
you
i
never
saw
you
taken
this
way
fact
is
i
think
i
know
the
man
said
i
think
i
looking
for
him
i
rather
think
he
is
my
twins
anyway
returned
stennis
and
about
the
same
time
a
carriage
driving
up
to
the
inn
he
took
his
departure
i
walked
till
in
the
plain
keeping
to
the
fields
for
i
instinctively
shunned
observation
and
was
racked
by
many
incongruous
and
impatient
feelings
here
was
a
man
whose
voice
i
had
once
heard
whose
doings
had
filled
so
many
days
of
my
life
with
interest
and
distress
whom
i
had
lain
awake
to
dream
of
like
a
lover
and
now
his
hand
was
on
the
door
now
we
were
to
meet
now
i
was
to
learn
at
last
the
mystery
of
the
substituted
crew
the
sun
went
down
over
the
plain
of
the
angelus
and
as
the
hour
approached
my
courage
lessened
i
let
the
laggard
peasants
pass
me
on
the
homeward
way
the
lamps
were
lit
the
soup
was
served
the
company
were
all
at
table
and
the
room
sounded
already
with
multitudinous
talk
before
i
entered
i
took
my
place
and
found
i
was
opposite
to
madden
over
six
feet
high
and
well
set
up
the
hair
dark
and
streaked
with
silver
the
eyes
dark
and
kindly
the
mouth
very
the
teeth
admirable
linen
and
hands
exquisite
english
clothes
an
english
voice
an
english
bearing
the
man
stood
out
conspicuous
from
the
company
yet
he
had
made
himself
at
home
and
seemed
to
enjoy
a
certain
quiet
popularity
among
the
noisy
boys
of
the
table
he
had
an
odd
silver
giggle
of
a
laugh
that
sounded
nervous
even
when
he
was
really
amused
and
accorded
ill
with
his
big
stature
and
manly
melancholy
face
this
laugh
fell
in
continually
all
through
dinner
like
the
note
of
the
triangle
in
a
piece
of
modern
french
music
and
he
had
at
times
a
kind
of
pleasantry
rather
of
manner
than
of
words
with
which
he
started
or
maintained
the
merriment
he
took
his
share
in
these
diversions
not
so
much
like
a
man
in
high
spirits
but
like
one
of
an
approved
good
nature
habitually
accustomed
to
please
and
to
follow
others
i
have
remarked
in
old
soldiers
much
the
same
smiling
sadness
and
sociable
i
feared
to
look
at
him
lest
my
glances
should
betray
my
deep
excitement
and
chance
served
me
so
well
that
the
soup
was
scarce
removed
before
we
were
naturally
introduced
my
first
sip
of
chateau
siron
a
vintage
from
which
i
had
been
long
estranged
startled
me
into
speech
this
never
do
i
cried
in
english
stuff
is
it
said
madden
in
the
same
language
let
me
ask
you
to
share
my
bottle
they
call
it
chambertin
which
it
is
but
it
fairly
palatable
and
there
nothing
in
this
house
that
a
man
can
drink
at
i
accepted
anything
would
do
that
paved
the
way
to
better
knowledge
name
is
madden
i
think
said
i
old
friend
stennis
told
me
about
you
when
i
i
am
sorry
he
went
i
feel
such
a
grandfather
william
alone
among
all
these
lads
he
replied
name
is
dodd
i
resumed
said
he
madame
siron
told
of
san
francisco
i
continued
of
pinkerton
and
block
i
think
said
he
same
said
i
neither
of
us
looked
at
each
other
but
i
could
see
his
hand
deliberately
making
bread
pills
a
nice
thing
of
yours
i
pursued
panel
the
foreground
is
a
little
clayey
perhaps
but
the
lagoon
is
ought
to
know
said
he
returned
i
rather
a
good
judge
of
that
there
was
a
considerable
pause
know
a
man
by
the
name
of
bellairs
do
you
he
resumed
cried
i
have
heard
from
doctor
urquart
very
morning
he
replied
there
is
no
hurry
about
bellairs
said
i
rather
a
long
story
and
rather
a
silly
one
but
i
think
we
have
a
good
deal
to
tell
each
other
and
perhaps
we
had
better
wait
till
we
are
more
think
so
said
he
that
any
of
these
fellows
know
english
but
we
be
more
comfortable
over
at
my
place
your
health
and
we
took
wine
together
across
the
table
thus
had
this
singular
introduction
passed
unperceived
in
the
midst
of
more
than
thirty
persons
art
students
ladies
in
and
covered
with
rice
powder
six
foot
of
siron
whisking
dishes
over
our
head
and
his
noisy
sons
clattering
in
and
out
with
fresh
relays
question
more
said
i
you
recognise
my
voice
voice
he
repeated
should
i
i
had
never
heard
it
we
have
never
yet
we
have
been
in
conversation
before
now
said
i
i
asked
you
a
question
which
you
never
answered
and
which
i
have
since
had
many
thousand
better
reasons
for
putting
to
he
turned
suddenly
white
god
he
cried
you
the
man
in
the
telephone
i
nodded
well
said
he
would
take
a
good
deal
of
magnanimity
to
forgive
you
that
what
nights
i
have
passed
that
little
whisper
has
whistled
in
my
ear
ever
since
like
the
wind
in
a
keyhole
who
could
it
be
what
could
it
mean
i
suppose
i
have
had
more
real
solid
misery
out
of
that
he
paused
and
looked
troubled
i
had
more
to
bother
me
or
ought
to
have
he
added
and
slowly
emptied
his
glass
seems
we
were
born
to
drive
each
other
crazy
with
conundrums
said
i
have
often
thought
my
head
would
carthew
burst
into
his
foolish
laugh
yet
neither
you
nor
i
had
the
worst
of
the
puzzle
he
cried
were
others
deeper
who
were
they
i
asked
underwriters
said
he
to
be
sure
cried
i
never
thought
of
that
what
could
they
make
of
it
replied
carthew
could
be
explained
they
were
a
crowd
of
small
dealers
at
lloyd
who
took
it
up
in
syndicate
one
of
them
has
a
carriage
now
and
people
say
he
is
a
deuce
of
a
deep
fellow
and
has
the
makings
of
a
great
financier
another
furnished
a
small
villa
on
the
profits
but
they
all
hopelessly
muddled
and
when
they
meet
each
other
they
do
know
where
to
look
like
the
dinner
was
no
sooner
at
an
end
than
he
carried
me
across
the
road
to
masson
old
studio
it
was
strangely
changed
on
the
walls
were
tapestry
a
few
good
etchings
and
some
amazing
pictures
a
rousseau
a
corot
a
really
superb
old
crome
a
whistler
and
a
piece
which
my
host
claimed
and
i
believe
to
be
a
titian
the
room
was
furnished
with
comfortable
english
chairs
some
american
rockers
and
an
elaborate
business
table
spirits
and
with
the
mark
of
schweppe
no
less
stood
ready
on
a
butler
tray
and
in
one
corner
behind
a
curtain
i
spied
a
and
a
capacious
tub
such
a
room
in
barbizon
astonished
the
beholder
like
the
glories
of
the
cave
of
monte
cristo
said
he
are
quiet
sit
down
if
you
do
mind
and
tell
me
your
story
all
i
did
as
he
asked
beginning
with
the
day
when
jim
showed
me
the
passage
in
the
and
winding
up
with
the
stamp
album
and
the
chailly
postmark
it
was
a
long
business
and
carthew
made
it
longer
for
he
was
insatiable
of
details
and
it
had
struck
midnight
on
the
old
clock
in
the
corner
before
i
had
made
an
end
now
said
he
about
i
must
tell
you
my
side
much
as
i
hate
it
mine
is
a
beastly
story
you
wonder
how
i
can
sleep
i
told
it
once
before
lady
ann
i
asked
you
suppose
he
answered
to
say
the
truth
i
had
sworn
never
to
tell
it
again
only
you
seem
somehow
entitled
to
the
thing
you
have
paid
dear
enough
god
knows
and
god
knows
i
hope
you
may
like
it
now
you
got
it
with
that
he
began
his
yarn
a
new
day
had
dawned
the
cocks
crew
in
the
village
and
the
early
woodmen
were
afoot
when
he
concluded
chapter
xxii
the
remittance
man
singleton
carthew
the
father
of
norris
was
heavily
built
and
feebly
vitalised
sensitive
as
a
musician
dull
as
a
sheep
and
conscientious
as
a
dog
he
took
his
position
with
seriousness
even
with
pomp
the
long
rooms
the
silent
servants
seemed
in
his
eyes
like
the
observances
of
some
religion
of
which
he
was
the
mortal
god
he
had
the
stupid
intolerance
of
stupidity
in
others
the
vain
man
exquisite
alarm
lest
it
should
be
detected
in
himself
and
on
both
sides
norris
irritated
and
offended
him
he
thought
his
son
a
fool
and
he
suspected
that
his
son
returned
the
compliment
with
interest
the
history
of
their
relation
was
simple
they
met
seldom
they
quarrelled
often
to
his
mother
a
fiery
pungent
practical
woman
already
disappointed
in
her
husband
and
her
elder
son
norris
was
only
a
fresh
disappointment
yet
the
lad
faults
were
no
great
matter
he
was
diffident
placable
passive
unambitious
unenterprising
life
did
not
much
attract
him
he
watched
it
like
a
curious
and
dull
exhibition
not
much
amused
and
not
tempted
in
the
least
to
take
a
part
he
beheld
his
father
ponderously
grinding
sand
his
mother
fierily
breaking
butterflies
his
brother
labouring
at
the
pleasures
of
the
hawbuck
with
the
ardour
of
a
soldier
in
a
doubtful
battle
and
the
vital
sceptic
looked
on
wondering
they
were
careful
and
troubled
about
many
things
for
him
there
seemed
not
even
one
thing
needful
he
was
born
disenchanted
the
world
promises
awoke
no
echo
in
his
bosom
the
world
activities
and
the
distinctions
seemed
to
him
equally
without
a
base
in
fact
he
liked
the
open
air
he
liked
comradeship
it
mattered
not
with
whom
his
comrades
were
only
a
remedy
for
solitude
and
he
had
a
taste
for
painted
art
an
array
of
fine
pictures
looked
upon
his
childhood
and
from
these
roods
of
jewelled
canvas
he
received
an
indelible
impression
the
gallery
at
stallbridge
betokened
generations
of
picture
lovers
norris
was
perhaps
the
first
of
his
race
to
hold
the
pencil
the
taste
was
genuine
it
grew
and
strengthened
with
his
growth
and
yet
he
suffered
it
to
be
suppressed
with
scarce
a
struggle
time
came
for
him
to
go
to
oxford
and
he
resisted
faintly
he
was
stupid
he
said
it
was
no
good
to
put
him
through
the
mill
he
wished
to
be
a
painter
the
words
fell
on
his
father
like
a
thunderbolt
and
norris
made
haste
to
give
way
really
matter
do
you
know
said
he
it
seemed
an
awful
shame
to
vex
the
old
to
oxford
he
went
obediently
hopelessly
and
at
oxford
became
the
hero
of
a
certain
circle
he
was
active
and
adroit
when
he
was
in
the
humour
he
excelled
in
many
sports
and
his
singular
melancholy
detachment
gave
him
a
place
apart
he
set
a
fashion
in
his
clique
envious
undergraduates
sought
to
parody
his
unaffected
lack
of
zeal
and
fear
it
was
a
kind
of
new
byronism
more
composed
and
dignified
really
among
other
things
this
formula
embraced
the
dons
and
though
he
always
meant
to
be
civil
the
effect
on
the
college
authorities
was
one
of
startling
rudeness
his
indifference
cut
like
insolence
and
in
some
outbreak
of
his
constitutional
levity
the
complement
of
his
melancholy
he
was
in
the
middle
of
the
second
year
the
event
was
new
in
the
annals
of
the
carthews
and
singleton
was
prepared
to
make
the
most
of
it
it
had
been
long
his
practice
to
prophesy
for
his
second
son
a
career
of
ruin
and
disgrace
there
is
an
advantage
in
this
artless
parental
habit
doubtless
the
father
is
interested
in
his
son
but
doubtless
also
the
prophet
grows
to
be
interested
in
his
prophecies
if
the
one
goes
wrong
the
others
come
true
old
carthew
drew
from
this
source
esoteric
consolations
he
dwelt
at
length
on
his
own
foresight
he
produced
variations
hitherto
unheard
from
the
old
theme
told
you
so
coupled
his
son
name
with
the
gallows
and
the
hulks
and
spoke
of
his
small
handful
of
college
debts
as
though
he
must
raise
money
on
a
mortgage
to
discharge
them
do
think
that
is
fair
sir
said
norris
lived
at
college
exactly
as
you
told
me
i
am
sorry
i
was
sent
down
and
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
blame
me
for
that
but
you
have
no
right
to
pitch
into
me
about
these
the
effect
upon
a
stupid
man
not
unjustly
incensed
need
scarcely
be
described
for
a
while
singleton
raved
tell
you
what
father
said
norris
at
last
do
think
this
is
going
to
do
i
think
you
had
better
let
me
take
to
painting
the
only
thing
i
take
a
spark
of
interest
in
i
shall
never
be
steady
as
long
as
i
at
anything
you
stand
here
sir
to
the
neck
in
disgrace
said
the
father
should
have
hoped
you
would
have
had
more
good
taste
than
to
repeat
this
the
hint
was
taken
the
levity
was
never
more
obtruded
on
the
notice
and
norris
was
inexorably
launched
upon
a
backward
voyage
he
went
abroad
to
study
foreign
languages
which
he
learned
at
a
very
expensive
rate
and
a
fresh
crop
of
debts
fell
soon
to
be
paid
with
similar
lamentations
which
were
in
this
case
perfectly
justified
and
to
which
norris
paid
no
regard
he
had
been
unfairly
treated
over
the
oxford
affair
and
with
a
spice
of
malice
very
surprising
in
one
so
placable
and
an
obstinacy
remarkable
in
one
so
weak
refused
from
that
day
forward
to
exercise
the
least
captaincy
on
his
expenses
he
wasted
what
he
would
he
allowed
his
servants
to
despoil
him
at
their
pleasure
he
sowed
insolvency
and
when
the
crop
was
ripe
notified
his
father
with
exasperating
calm
his
own
capital
was
put
in
his
hands
he
was
planted
in
the
diplomatic
service
and
told
he
must
depend
upon
himself
he
did
so
till
he
was
by
which
time
he
had
spent
his
money
laid
in
a
handsome
choice
of
debts
and
acquired
like
so
many
other
melancholic
and
uninterested
persons
a
habit
of
gambling
an
austrian
colonel
the
same
who
afterwards
hanged
himself
at
monte
carlo
gave
him
a
lesson
which
lasted
hours
and
left
him
wrecked
and
helpless
old
singleton
once
more
repurchased
the
honour
of
his
name
this
time
at
a
fancy
figure
and
norris
was
set
afloat
again
on
stern
conditions
an
allowance
of
three
hundred
pounds
in
the
year
was
to
be
paid
to
him
quarterly
by
a
lawyer
in
sydney
new
south
wales
he
was
not
to
write
should
he
fail
on
any
to
be
in
sydney
he
was
to
be
held
for
dead
and
the
allowance
tacitly
withdrawn
should
he
return
to
europe
an
advertisement
publicly
disowning
him
was
to
appear
in
every
paper
of
repute
it
was
one
of
his
most
annoying
features
as
a
son
that
he
was
always
polite
always
just
and
in
whatever
whirlwind
of
domestic
anger
always
calm
he
expected
trouble
when
trouble
came
he
was
unmoved
he
might
have
said
with
singleton
told
you
he
was
content
with
thinking
as
i
on
the
fall
of
these
last
thunderbolts
he
bore
himself
like
a
person
only
distantly
interested
in
the
event
pocketed
the
money
and
the
reproaches
obeyed
orders
punctually
took
ship
and
came
to
sydney
some
men
are
still
lads
at
and
so
it
was
with
norris
eighteen
days
after
he
landed
his
quarter
allowance
was
all
gone
and
with
the
hopefulness
of
strangers
in
what
is
called
a
new
country
he
began
to
besiege
offices
and
apply
for
all
manner
of
incongruous
situations
everywhere
and
last
of
all
from
his
lodgings
he
was
bowed
out
and
found
himself
reduced
in
a
very
elegant
suit
of
summer
tweeds
to
herd
and
camp
with
the
degraded
outcasts
of
the
city
in
this
strait
he
had
recourse
to
the
lawyer
who
paid
him
his
allowance
to
remember
that
my
time
is
valuable
carthew
said
the
lawyer
is
quite
unnecessary
you
should
enlarge
on
the
peculiar
position
in
which
you
stand
remittance
men
as
we
call
them
here
are
not
so
rare
in
my
experience
and
in
such
cases
i
act
upon
a
system
i
make
you
a
present
of
a
sovereign
here
it
is
every
day
you
choose
to
call
my
clerk
will
advance
you
a
shilling
on
saturday
since
my
office
is
closed
on
sunday
he
will
advance
you
half
a
crown
my
conditions
are
these
that
you
do
not
come
to
me
but
to
my
clerk
that
you
do
not
come
here
the
worse
of
liquor
and
you
go
away
the
moment
you
are
paid
and
have
signed
a
receipt
i
wish
you
a
have
to
thank
you
i
suppose
said
carthew
position
is
so
wretched
that
i
can
not
even
refuse
this
starvation
said
the
lawyer
smiling
man
will
starve
here
on
a
shilling
a
day
i
had
on
my
hands
another
young
gentleman
who
remained
continuously
intoxicated
for
six
years
on
the
same
and
he
once
more
busied
himself
with
his
papers
in
the
time
that
followed
the
image
of
the
smiling
lawyer
haunted
carthew
memory
three
minutes
talk
was
all
the
education
i
ever
had
worth
talking
of
says
he
was
all
life
in
a
confound
it
i
thought
have
i
got
to
the
point
of
envying
that
ancient
fossil
every
morning
for
the
next
two
or
three
weeks
the
stroke
of
ten
found
norris
unkempt
and
haggard
at
the
lawyer
door
the
long
day
and
longer
night
he
spent
in
the
domain
now
on
a
bench
now
on
the
grass
under
a
norfolk
island
pine
the
companion
of
perhaps
the
lowest
class
on
earth
the
larrikins
of
sydney
morning
after
morning
the
dawn
behind
the
lighthouse
recalled
him
from
slumber
and
he
would
stand
and
gaze
upon
the
changing
east
the
fading
lenses
the
smokeless
city
and
the
and
harbour
growing
slowly
clear
under
his
eyes
his
so
to
call
them
were
less
active
they
lay
sprawled
upon
the
grass
and
benches
the
dingy
men
the
frowsy
women
prolonging
their
late
repose
and
carthew
wandered
among
the
sleeping
bodies
alone
and
cursed
the
incurable
stupidity
of
his
behaviour
day
brought
a
new
society
of
and
children
and
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
maidens
and
gay
people
in
rich
traps
upon
the
skirts
of
which
carthew
and
other
his
own
bitter
phrase
skulked
and
chewed
grass
and
looked
on
day
passed
the
light
died
the
green
and
leafy
precinct
sparkled
with
lamps
or
lay
in
shadow
and
the
round
of
the
night
began
again
the
loitering
women
the
lurking
men
the
sudden
outburst
of
screams
the
sound
of
flying
feet
may
believe
it
says
carthew
i
got
to
that
pitch
that
i
did
care
a
hang
i
have
been
wakened
out
of
my
sleep
to
hear
a
woman
screaming
and
i
have
only
turned
upon
my
other
side
yes
it
a
queer
place
where
the
dowagers
and
the
kids
walk
all
day
and
at
night
you
can
hear
people
bawling
for
help
as
if
it
was
the
forest
of
bondy
with
the
lights
of
a
great
town
all
round
and
parties
spinning
through
in
cabs
from
government
house
and
dinner
with
my
lord
it
was
norris
diversion
having
none
other
to
scrape
acquaintance
where
how
and
with
whom
he
could
many
a
long
dull
talk
he
held
upon
the
benches
or
the
grass
many
a
strange
waif
he
came
to
know
many
strange
things
he
heard
and
saw
some
that
were
abominable
it
was
to
one
of
these
last
that
he
owed
his
deliverance
from
the
domain
for
some
time
the
rain
had
been
merciless
one
night
after
another
he
had
been
obliged
to
squander
fourpence
on
a
bed
and
reduce
his
board
to
the
remaining
eightpence
and
he
sat
one
morning
near
the
macquarrie
street
entrance
hungry
for
he
had
gone
without
breakfast
and
wet
as
he
had
already
been
for
several
days
when
the
cries
of
an
animal
in
distress
attracted
his
attention
some
fifty
yards
away
in
the
extreme
angle
of
the
grass
a
party
of
the
chronically
unemployed
had
got
hold
of
a
dog
whom
they
were
torturing
in
a
manner
not
to
be
described
the
heart
of
norris
which
had
grown
indifferent
to
the
cries
of
human
anger
or
distress
woke
at
the
appeal
of
the
dumb
creature
he
ran
amongst
the
larrikins
scattered
them
rescued
the
dog
and
stood
at
bay
they
were
six
in
number
shambling
gallowsbirds
but
for
once
the
proverb
was
right
cruelty
was
coupled
with
cowardice
and
the
wretches
cursed
him
and
made
off
it
chanced
that
this
act
of
prowess
had
not
passed
unwitnessed
on
a
bench
near
by
there
was
seated
a
assistant
out
of
employ
a
diminutive
cheerful
creature
by
the
name
of
hemstead
he
was
the
last
man
to
have
interfered
himself
for
his
discretion
more
than
equalled
his
valour
but
he
made
haste
to
congratulate
carthew
and
to
warn
him
he
might
not
always
be
so
fortunate
a
dyngerous
lot
of
people
about
this
park
my
word
it
do
to
ply
with
them
he
observed
in
that
rycy
austrylian
english
which
as
it
has
received
the
imprimatur
of
froude
we
should
all
make
haste
to
imitate
i
one
of
that
lot
myself
returned
carthew
hemstead
laughed
and
remarked
that
he
knew
a
gentleman
when
he
saw
one
all
that
i
am
simply
one
of
the
unemployed
said
carthew
seating
himself
beside
his
new
acquaintance
as
he
had
sat
since
this
experience
began
beside
so
many
dozen
others
out
of
a
plyce
myself
said
hemstead
beat
me
all
the
way
and
back
says
carthew
trouble
is
that
i
have
never
been
in
suppose
you
no
tryde
asked
hemstead
know
how
to
spend
money
replied
carthew
i
really
do
know
something
of
horses
and
something
of
the
sea
but
the
unions
head
me
off
if
it
were
for
them
i
might
have
had
a
dozen
word
cried
the
sympathetic
listener
try
the
mounted
police
he
inquired
did
and
was
bowled
out
was
the
reply
pass
the
what
do
you
think
of
the
ryleways
then
asked
hemstead
do
you
think
of
them
if
you
come
to
that
asked
carthew
do
think
of
them
i
do
go
in
for
manual
labour
said
the
little
man
proudly
if
a
man
do
mind
that
he
pretty
sure
of
a
job
george
you
tell
me
where
to
go
cried
carthew
rising
the
heavy
rains
continued
the
country
was
already
overrun
with
floods
the
railway
system
daily
required
more
hands
daily
the
superintendent
advertised
but
preferred
the
resources
of
charity
and
rapine
and
a
navvy
even
an
amateur
navvy
commanded
money
in
the
market
the
same
night
after
a
tedious
journey
and
a
change
of
trains
to
pass
a
landslip
norris
found
himself
in
a
muddy
cutting
behind
south
clifton
attacking
his
first
shift
of
manual
labour
for
weeks
the
rain
scarce
relented
the
whole
front
of
the
mountain
slipped
seaward
from
above
avalanches
of
clay
rock
and
uprooted
forest
spewed
over
the
cliffs
and
fell
upon
the
beach
or
in
the
breakers
houses
were
carried
bodily
away
and
smashed
like
nuts
others
were
menaced
and
deserted
the
door
locked
the
chimney
cold
the
dwellers
fled
elsewhere
for
safety
night
and
day
the
fire
blazed
in
the
encampment
night
and
day
hot
coffee
was
served
to
the
overdriven
toilers
in
the
shift
night
and
day
the
engineer
of
the
section
made
his
rounds
with
words
of
encouragement
hearty
and
rough
and
well
suited
to
his
men
night
and
day
too
the
telegraph
clicked
with
disastrous
news
and
anxious
inquiry
along
the
terraced
line
of
rail
rare
trains
came
creeping
and
signalling
and
paused
at
the
threatened
corner
like
living
things
conscious
of
peril
the
commandant
of
the
post
would
hastily
review
his
labours
make
with
a
dry
throat
the
signal
to
advance
and
the
whole
squad
line
the
way
and
look
on
in
a
choking
silence
or
burst
into
a
brief
cheer
as
the
train
cleared
the
point
of
danger
and
shot
on
perhaps
through
the
thin
sunshine
between
squalls
perhaps
with
blinking
lamps
into
the
gathering
rainy
twilight
one
such
scene
carthew
will
remember
till
he
dies
it
blew
great
guns
from
the
seaward
a
huge
surf
bombarded
five
hundred
feet
below
him
the
steep
mountain
foot
close
in
was
a
vessel
in
distress
firing
shots
from
a
if
any
help
might
come
so
he
saw
and
heard
her
the
moment
before
the
train
appeared
and
paused
throwing
up
a
babylonian
tower
of
smoke
into
the
rain
and
oppressing
men
hearts
with
the
scream
of
her
whistle
the
engineer
was
there
himself
he
paled
as
he
made
the
signal
the
engine
came
at
a
foot
pace
but
the
whole
bulk
of
mountain
shook
and
seemed
to
nod
seaward
and
the
watching
navvies
instinctively
clutched
at
shrubs
and
trees
vain
precautions
vain
as
the
shots
from
the
poor
sailors
once
again
fear
was
disappointed
the
train
passed
unscathed
and
norris
drawing
a
long
breath
remembered
the
labouring
ship
and
glanced
below
she
was
gone
so
the
days
and
the
nights
passed
homeric
labour
in
homeric
circumstance
carthew
was
sick
with
sleeplessness
and
coffee
his
hands
softened
by
the
wet
were
cut
to
ribbons
yet
he
enjoyed
a
peace
of
mind
and
health
of
body
hitherto
unknown
plenty
of
open
air
plenty
of
physical
exertion
a
continual
instancy
of
toil
here
was
what
had
been
hitherto
lacking
in
that
misdirected
life
and
the
true
cure
of
vital
scepticism
to
get
the
train
through
there
was
the
recurrent
problem
no
time
remained
to
ask
if
it
were
necessary
carthew
the
idler
the
spendthrift
the
drifting
dilettant
was
soon
remarked
praised
and
advanced
the
engineer
swore
by
him
and
pointed
him
out
for
an
example
a
new
chum
up
here
norris
overheard
him
saying
young
swell
he
worth
any
two
in
the
the
words
fell
on
the
ears
of
the
discarded
son
like
music
and
from
that
moment
he
not
only
found
an
interest
he
took
a
pride
in
his
plebeian
tasks
the
press
of
work
was
still
at
its
highest
when
approached
norris
was
now
raised
to
a
position
of
some
trust
at
his
discretion
trains
were
stopped
or
forwarded
at
the
dangerous
cornice
near
north
clifton
and
he
found
in
this
responsibility
both
terror
and
delight
the
thought
of
the
pounds
that
would
soon
await
him
at
the
lawyer
and
of
his
own
obligation
to
be
present
every
in
sydney
filled
him
for
a
little
with
divided
councils
then
he
made
up
his
mind
walked
in
a
slack
moment
to
the
inn
at
clifton
ordered
a
sheet
of
paper
and
a
bottle
of
beer
and
wrote
explaining
that
he
held
a
good
appointment
which
he
would
lose
if
he
came
to
sydney
and
asking
the
lawyer
to
accept
this
letter
as
an
evidence
of
his
presence
in
the
colony
and
retain
the
money
till
next
the
answer
came
in
course
of
post
and
was
not
merely
favourable
but
cordial
what
you
propose
is
contrary
to
the
terms
of
my
instructions
it
ran
willingly
accept
the
responsibility
of
granting
your
request
i
should
say
i
am
agreeably
disappointed
in
your
behaviour
my
experience
has
not
led
me
to
found
much
expectations
on
gentlemen
in
your
the
rains
abated
and
the
temporary
labour
was
discharged
not
norris
to
whom
the
engineer
clung
as
to
found
money
not
norris
who
found
himself
a
ganger
on
the
line
in
the
regular
staff
of
navvies
his
camp
was
pitched
in
a
grey
wilderness
of
rock
and
forest
far
from
any
house
as
he
sat
with
his
mates
about
the
evening
fire
the
trains
passing
on
the
track
were
their
next
and
indeed
their
only
neighbours
except
the
wild
things
of
the
wood
lovely
weather
light
and
monotonous
employment
long
hours
of
somnolent
talk
long
sleepless
nights
when
he
reviewed
his
foolish
and
fruitless
career
as
he
rose
and
walked
in
the
moonlit
forest
an
occasional
paper
of
which
he
would
read
all
the
advertisements
with
as
much
relish
as
the
text
such
was
the
tenor
of
an
existence
which
soon
began
to
weary
and
harass
him
he
lacked
and
regretted
the
fatigue
the
furious
hurry
the
suspense
the
fires
the
midnight
coffee
the
rude
and
poetry
of
the
first
toilful
weeks
in
the
quietness
of
his
new
surroundings
a
voice
summoned
him
from
this
exorbital
part
of
life
and
about
the
middle
of
october
he
threw
up
his
situation
and
bade
farewell
to
the
camp
of
tents
and
the
shoulder
of
bald
mountain
clad
in
his
rough
clothes
with
a
bundle
on
his
shoulder
and
his
accumulated
wages
in
his
pocket
he
entered
sydney
for
the
second
time
and
walked
with
pleasure
and
some
bewilderment
in
the
cheerful
streets
like
a
man
landed
from
a
voyage
the
sight
of
the
people
led
him
on
he
forgot
his
necessary
errands
he
forgot
to
eat
he
wandered
in
moving
multitudes
like
a
stick
upon
a
river
last
he
came
to
the
domain
and
strolled
there
and
remembered
his
shame
and
sufferings
and
looked
with
poignant
curiosity
at
his
successors
hemstead
not
much
shabbier
and
no
less
cheerful
than
before
he
recognised
and
addressed
like
an
old
family
friend
was
a
good
turn
you
did
me
said
he
railway
was
the
making
of
me
i
hope
you
had
luck
word
no
replied
the
little
man
just
sit
here
and
read
the
it
the
depression
in
tryde
you
see
there
no
positions
goin
that
a
man
like
me
would
care
to
look
and
he
showed
norris
his
certificates
and
written
characters
one
from
a
grocer
in
wooloomooloo
one
from
an
ironmonger
and
a
third
from
a
billiard
saloon
he
said
tried
bein
a
billiard
marker
it
no
account
these
lyte
hours
are
no
use
for
a
man
health
i
wo
be
no
man
slyve
he
added
firmly
on
the
principle
that
he
who
is
too
proud
to
be
a
slave
is
usually
not
too
modest
to
become
a
pensioner
carthew
gave
him
half
a
sovereign
and
departed
being
suddenly
struck
with
hunger
in
the
direction
of
the
paris
house
when
he
came
to
that
quarter
of
the
city
the
barristers
were
trotting
in
the
streets
in
wig
and
gown
and
he
stood
to
observe
them
with
his
bundle
on
his
shoulder
and
his
mind
full
of
curious
recollections
of
the
past
george
cried
a
voice
carthew
and
turning
about
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
handsome
sunburnt
youth
somewhat
fatted
arrayed
in
the
finest
of
fine
raiment
and
sporting
about
a
sovereign
worth
of
flowers
in
his
buttonhole
norris
had
met
him
during
his
first
days
in
sydney
at
a
farewell
supper
had
even
escorted
him
on
board
a
schooner
full
of
cockroaches
and
sailors
in
which
he
was
bound
for
six
months
among
the
islands
and
had
kept
him
ever
since
in
entertained
remembrance
tom
hadden
known
to
the
bulk
of
sydney
folk
as
tommy
was
heir
to
a
considerable
property
which
a
prophetic
father
had
placed
in
the
hands
of
rigorous
trustees
the
income
supported
hadden
in
splendour
for
about
three
months
out
of
twelve
the
rest
of
the
year
he
passed
in
retreat
among
the
islands
he
was
now
about
a
week
returned
from
his
eclipse
pervading
sydney
in
hansom
cabs
and
airing
the
first
bloom
of
six
new
suits
of
clothes
and
yet
the
unaffected
creature
hailed
carthew
in
his
working
jeans
and
with
the
damning
bundle
on
his
shoulder
as
he
might
have
claimed
acquaintance
with
a
duke
and
have
a
drink
was
his
cheerful
cry
just
going
to
have
lunch
at
the
paris
house
returned
carthew
a
long
time
since
i
have
had
a
decent
scheme
said
hadden
only
had
breakfast
half
an
hour
ago
but
we
have
a
private
room
and
i
manage
to
pick
something
it
brace
me
up
i
was
on
an
awful
tear
last
night
and
i
met
no
end
of
fellows
this
to
meet
a
fellow
and
to
stand
and
share
a
drink
were
with
tom
synonymous
terms
they
were
soon
at
table
in
the
corner
room
and
paying
due
attention
to
the
best
fare
in
sydney
the
odd
similarity
of
their
positions
drew
them
together
and
they
began
soon
to
exchange
confidences
carthew
related
his
privations
in
the
domain
and
his
toils
as
a
navvy
hadden
gave
his
experience
as
an
amateur
copra
merchant
in
the
south
seas
and
drew
a
humorous
picture
of
life
in
a
coral
island
of
the
two
plans
of
retirement
carthew
gathered
that
his
own
had
been
vastly
the
more
lucrative
but
hadden
trading
outfit
had
consisted
largely
of
bottled
stout
and
brown
sherry
for
his
own
consumption
had
champagne
too
said
hadden
i
kept
that
in
case
of
sickness
until
i
did
seem
to
be
going
to
be
sick
and
then
i
opened
a
pint
every
sunday
used
to
sleep
all
morning
then
breakfast
with
my
pint
of
fizz
and
lie
in
a
hammock
and
read
hallam
have
you
read
that
i
always
take
something
solid
to
the
islands
there
no
doubt
i
did
the
thing
in
rather
a
fine
style
but
if
it
was
gone
about
a
little
cheaper
or
there
were
two
of
us
to
bear
the
expense
it
ought
to
pay
hand
over
fist
i
got
the
influence
you
see
i
a
chief
now
and
sit
in
the
under
my
own
strip
of
roof
i
like
to
see
them
taboo
me
they
dare
try
it
i
a
strong
party
i
can
tell
you
why
i
had
upwards
of
thirty
cowtops
sitting
in
my
front
verandah
eating
tins
of
asked
carthew
are
they
what
hallam
would
call
feudal
retainers
explained
hadden
not
without
vainglory
my
followers
they
belong
to
my
family
i
tell
you
they
come
expensive
though
you
ca
fill
up
all
these
retainers
on
tinned
salmon
for
nothing
but
whenever
i
could
get
it
i
would
give
squid
squid
good
for
natives
but
i
do
care
for
it
do
you
or
shark
either
it
like
the
working
classes
at
home
with
copra
at
the
price
it
is
they
ought
to
be
willing
to
bear
their
share
of
the
loss
and
so
i
told
them
again
and
again
i
think
it
a
duty
to
open
their
minds
and
i
try
to
but
you
ca
get
political
economy
into
them
it
does
seem
to
reach
their
there
was
an
expression
still
sticking
in
carthew
memory
and
he
returned
upon
it
with
a
smile
of
political
economy
said
he
said
if
there
were
two
of
us
to
bear
the
expense
the
profits
would
increase
how
do
you
make
out
that
show
you
i
figure
it
out
for
you
cried
hadden
and
with
a
pencil
on
the
back
of
the
bill
of
fare
proceeded
to
perform
miracles
he
was
a
man
or
let
us
rather
say
a
lad
of
unusual
projective
power
give
him
the
faintest
hint
of
any
speculation
and
the
figures
flowed
from
him
by
the
page
a
lively
imagination
and
a
ready
though
inaccurate
memory
supplied
his
data
he
delivered
himself
with
an
inimitable
heat
that
made
him
seem
the
picture
of
pugnacity
lavished
contradiction
had
a
form
of
words
with
or
without
significance
for
every
form
of
criticism
and
the
alternately
smiled
at
his
simplicity
and
fervour
or
was
amazed
by
his
unexpected
shrewdness
he
was
a
kind
of
pinkerton
in
play
i
have
called
jim
the
romance
of
business
this
was
its
arabian
tale
you
any
idea
what
this
would
cost
he
asked
pausing
at
an
item
i
said
carthew
pounds
ought
to
be
ample
concluded
the
projector
nonsense
cried
carthew
at
the
very
told
me
yourself
this
moment
you
knew
nothing
about
it
cried
tommy
can
i
make
a
calculation
if
you
blow
hot
and
cold
you
do
seem
able
to
be
serious
but
he
consented
to
raise
his
estimate
to
twenty
and
a
little
after
the
calculation
coming
out
with
a
deficit
cut
it
down
again
to
five
pounds
ten
with
the
remark
told
you
it
was
nonsense
this
sort
of
thing
has
to
be
done
strictly
or
where
the
use
some
of
these
processes
struck
carthew
as
unsound
and
he
was
at
times
altogether
thrown
out
by
the
capricious
startings
of
the
prophet
mind
these
plunges
seemed
to
be
gone
into
for
exercise
and
by
the
way
like
the
curvets
of
a
willing
horse
gradually
the
thing
took
shape
the
glittering
if
baseless
edifice
arose
and
the
hare
still
ran
on
the
mountains
but
the
soup
was
already
served
in
silver
plate
carthew
in
a
few
days
could
command
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
hadden
was
ready
with
five
hundred
why
should
they
not
recruit
a
fellow
or
two
more
charter
an
old
ship
and
go
cruising
on
their
own
account
carthew
was
an
experienced
yachtsman
hadden
professed
himself
able
to
an
approximate
money
was
undoubtedly
to
be
made
or
why
should
so
many
vessels
cruise
about
the
islands
they
who
worked
their
own
ship
were
sure
of
a
still
higher
profit
whatever
else
comes
of
it
you
see
cried
hadden
get
our
keep
for
nothing
come
buy
some
togs
that
the
first
thing
you
have
to
do
of
course
and
then
we
take
a
hansom
and
go
to
the
currency
going
to
stick
to
the
togs
i
have
said
norris
you
cried
hadden
i
must
say
i
admire
you
you
a
regular
sage
it
what
you
call
pythagoreanism
is
it
if
i
forgotten
my
i
call
it
economy
returned
carthew
we
are
going
to
try
this
thing
on
i
shall
want
every
see
if
we
going
to
try
it
cried
tommy
rising
radiant
from
table
mark
you
carthew
it
must
be
all
in
your
name
i
have
capital
you
see
but
you
all
right
you
can
play
vacuus
viator
if
the
thing
goes
thought
we
had
just
proved
it
was
quite
safe
said
carthew
nothing
safe
in
business
my
boy
replied
the
sage
even
the
public
house
and
tea
garden
called
the
currency
lass
represented
a
moderate
fortune
gained
by
its
proprietor
captain
bostock
during
a
long
active
and
occasionally
historic
career
among
the
islands
anywhere
from
tonga
to
the
admiralty
isles
he
knew
the
ropes
and
could
lie
in
the
native
dialect
he
had
seen
the
end
of
sandal
wood
the
end
of
oil
and
the
beginning
of
copra
and
he
was
himself
a
commercial
pioneer
the
first
that
ever
carried
human
teeth
into
the
gilberts
he
was
tried
for
his
life
in
fiji
in
sir
arthur
gordon
time
and
if
ever
he
prayed
at
all
the
name
of
sir
arthur
was
certainly
not
forgotten
he
was
speared
in
seven
places
in
new
ireland
the
same
time
his
mate
was
killed
the
famous
on
the
brig
jolly
but
the
treacherous
savages
made
little
by
their
wickedness
and
bostock
in
spite
of
their
teeth
got
head
of
volunteer
labour
on
board
of
whom
not
more
than
a
dozen
died
of
injuries
he
had
a
hand
besides
in
the
amiable
pleasantry
which
cost
the
life
of
patteson
and
when
the
sham
bishop
landed
prayed
and
gave
his
benediction
to
the
natives
bostock
arrayed
in
a
female
chemise
out
of
the
traderoom
had
stood
at
his
right
hand
and
boomed
amens
this
when
he
was
sure
he
was
among
good
fellows
was
his
favourite
yarn
hundred
head
of
labour
for
a
hatful
of
amens
he
used
to
name
the
tale
and
its
sequel
the
death
of
the
real
bishop
struck
him
as
a
circumstance
of
extraordinary
humour
many
of
these
details
were
communicated
in
the
hansom
to
the
surprise
of
carthew
do
we
want
to
visit
this
old
ruffian
he
asked
wait
till
you
hear
him
replied
tommy
man
knows
on
descending
from
the
hansom
at
the
currency
lass
hadden
was
struck
with
the
appearance
of
the
cabman
a
gross
man
and
perhaps
nearing
forty
i
know
you
said
he
you
driven
me
before
the
time
hadden
returned
the
driver
last
time
you
was
back
from
the
islands
it
was
me
that
drove
you
to
the
races
right
jump
down
and
have
a
drink
then
said
tom
and
he
turned
and
led
the
way
into
the
garden
captain
bostock
met
the
party
he
was
a
slow
sour
old
man
with
fishy
eyes
greeted
tommy
offhand
and
as
was
afterwards
remembered
exchanged
winks
with
the
driver
bottle
of
beer
for
the
cabman
there
at
that
table
said
tom
you
please
from
shandygaff

champagne

this
one

down
with

me
make
you
acquainted
with
my
friend
carthew
i
come
on
business
billy
i
want
to
consult
you
as
a
friend
i
going
into
the
island
trade
upon
my
own
doubtless
the
captain
was
a
mine
of
counsel
but
opportunity
was
denied
him
he
could
not
venture
on
a
statement
he
was
scarce
allowed
to
finish
a
phrase
before
hadden
swept
him
from
the
field
with
a
volley
of
protest
and
correction
that
projector
his
face
blazing
with
inspiration
first
laid
before
him
at
inordinate
length
a
question
and
as
soon
as
he
attempted
to
reply
leaped
at
his
throat
called
his
facts
in
question
derided
his
policy
and
at
times
thundered
on
him
from
the
heights
of
moral
indignation
beg
your
pardon
he
said
once
am
a
gentleman
carthew
here
is
a
gentleman
and
we
do
mean
to
do
that
class
of
business
you
see
who
you
are
talking
to
ca
you
talk
sense
ca
you
give
us
dead
bird
for
a
good
traderoom
i
do
suppose
i
can
returned
old
bostock
when
i
hear
my
own
voice
for
two
seconds
together
it
was
gin
and
guns
i
did
it
your
gin
and
guns
to
putney
cried
hadden
was
the
thing
in
your
times
that
right
enough
but

old
now
and
the
game
up
i
tell
you
what
wanted
bill
bostock
said
he
and
did
and
took
ten
minutes
to
it
carthew
could
not
refrain
from
smiling
he
began
to
think
less
seriously
of
the
scheme
hadden
appearing
too
irresponsible
a
guide
but
on
the
other
hand
he
enjoyed
himself
amazingly
it
was
far
from
being
the
same
with
captain
bostock
know
a
sight
do
you
remarked
that
gentleman
bitterly
when
tommy
paused
know
a
sight
more
than
you
if
that
what
you
mean
retorted
tom
stands
to
reason
i
do
you
not
a
man
of
any
education
been
all
your
life
at
sea
or
in
the
islands
you
do
suppose
you
can
give
points
to
a
man
like
me
your
health
tommy
returned
bostock
make
an
bake
in
the
new
what
i
call
talking
cried
tom
not
perhaps
grasping
the
spirit
of
this
doubtful
compliment
you
give
me
your
attention
we
have
the
money
and
the
enterprise
and
i
have
the
experience
what
we
want
is
a
cheap
smart
boat
a
good
captain
and
an
introduction
to
some
house
that
will
give
us
credit
for
the
i
tell
you
said
captain
bostock
have
seen
men
like
you
baked
and
eaten
and
complained
of
afterwards
some
was
tough
and
some
had
no
flaviour
he
added
grimly
do
you
mean
by
that
cried
tom
mean
i
do
care
cried
bostock
ai
any
of
my
interests
i
have
underwrote
your
life
only
i
blest
if
i
not
sorry
for
the
cannibal
as
tries
to
eat
your
head
and
what
i
recommend
is
a
cheap
smart
coffin
and
a
good
undertaker
see
if
you
can
find
a
house
to
give
you
credit
for
a
coffin
look
at
your
friend
there
he
got
some
sense
he
laughing
at
you
so
as
he
ca
the
exact
degree
of
in
bostock
mind
was
difficult
to
gauge
perhaps
there
was
not
much
perhaps
he
regarded
his
remarks
as
a
form
of
courtly
badinage
but
there
is
little
doubt
that
hadden
resented
them
he
had
even
risen
from
his
place
and
the
conference
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
up
when
a
new
voice
joined
suddenly
in
the
conversation
the
cabman
sat
with
his
back
turned
upon
the
party
smoking
a
meerschaum
pipe
not
a
word
of
tommy
eloquence
had
missed
him
and
he
now
faced
suddenly
about
with
these
amazing
words
me
gentlemen
if
you
buy
me
the
ship
i
want
i
get
you
the
trade
on
there
was
a
pause
what
do
you
mean
gasped
tommy
tell
who
i
am
billy
said
the
cabman
it
safe
joe
inquired
bostock
take
my
risk
of
it
returned
the
cabman
said
bostock
rising
solemnly
me
make
you
acquainted
with
captain
wicks
of
the
grace
gentlemen
that
is
what
i
am
said
the
cabman
know
been
in
trouble
and
i
do
deny
but
what
i
struck
the
blow
and
where
was
i
to
get
evidence
of
my
provocation
so
i
turned
to
and
took
a
cab
and
i
driven
one
for
three
year
now
and
nobody
the
beg
your
pardon
said
carthew
joining
almost
for
the
first
time
a
new
chum
what
was
the
charge
said
captain
wicks
i
do
deny
but
what
i
struck
the
blow
and
there
no
sense
in
my
trying
to
deny
i
was
afraid
to
go
to
trial
or
why
would
i
be
here
but
it
a
fact
it
was
flat
mutiny
ask
billy
here
he
knows
how
it
carthew
breathed
long
he
had
a
strange
sense
of
wading
deeper
in
the
tide
of
life
said
he
were
going
on
to
say
was
going
on
to
say
this
said
the
captain
sturdily
overheard
what
hadden
has
been
saying
and
i
think
he
talks
good
sense
i
like
some
of
his
ideas
first
chop
he
sound
on
traderooms
he
all
there
on
the
traderoom
and
i
see
that
he
and
i
would
pull
together
then
you
both
gentlemen
and
i
like
that
observed
captain
wicks
then
i
tell
you
i
tired
of
this
cabbing
cruise
and
i
want
to
get
to
work
again
now
here
my
offer
i
a
little
money
i
can
stake
up
all
of
a
hundred
anyway
then
my
old
firm

give
me
trade
and
jump
at
the
chance
they
never
lost
by
me
they

what
i
worth
as
supercargo
and
last
of
all
you
want
a
good
captain
to
sail
your
ship
for
you
well
here
i
am
i
sailed

ten
years
ask
billy
if
i
can

man

said
billy
as
for
my
character
as
a
shipmate
concluded
wicks
and
ask
my
old
look
here
cried
hadden
do
you
mean
to
manage
you
can
whisk
round
in
a
hansom
and
no
questions
asked
but
if
you
try
to
come
on
a
my
boy
you
get
have
to
keep
back
till
the
last
replied
wicks
take
another
how
about
clearing
what
other
name
asked
tommy
a
little
bewildered
do
know
yet
returned
the
captain
with
a
grin
see
what
the
name
is
on
my
new
certificate
and
that
be
good
enough
for
me
if
i
ca
get
one
to
buy
though
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
old
kirkup
he
turned
some
sort
of
farmer
down
bondi
way
he
hire
me
seemed
to
speak
as
if
you
had
a
ship
in
view
said
carthew
i
have
too
said
captain
wicks
a
beauty
schooner
yacht
dream
got
lines
you
never
saw
the
beat
of
and
a
witch
to
go
she
passed
me
once
off
thursday
island
doing
two
knots
to
my
one
and
laying
a
point
and
a
half
better
and
the
grace
darling
was
a
ship
that
i
was
proud
of
i
took
and
tore
my
hair
the
dream
been
my
dream
ever
since
that
was
in
her
old
days
when
she
carried
a
blue
grant
sanderson
was
the
party
as
owned
her
he
was
rich
and
mad
and
got
a
fever
at
last
somewhere
about
the
fly
river
and
took
and
died
the
captain
brought
the
body
back
to
sydney
and
paid
off
well
it
turned
out
grant
sanderson
had
left
any
quantity
of
wills
and
any
quantity
of
widows
and
no
fellow
could
make
out
which
was
the
genuine
article
all
the
widows
brought
lawsuits
against
all
the
rest
and
every
will
had
a
firm
of
lawyers
on
the
quarterdeck
as
long
as
your
arm
they
tell
me
it
was
one
of
the
biggest
that
ever
was
seen
bar
tichborne
the
lord
chamberlain
himself
was
floored
and
so
was
the
lord
chancellor
and
all
that
time
the
dream
lay
rotting
up
by
glebe
point
well
it
done
now
they
picked
out
a
widow
and
a
will
tossed
up
for
it
as
like
as
not
and
the
dream
for
sale
she
go
cheap
she
had
a
long
at
size
is
she
big
enough
we
do
want
her
bigger
a
hundred
and
ninety
going
two
hundred
replied
the
captain
fully
big
for
us
three
it
would
be
all
the
better
if
we
had
another
hand
though
it
a
pity
too
when
you
can
pick
up
natives
for
half
nothing
then
we
must
have
a
cook
i
can
fix
raw
but
there
no
going
to
sea
with
a
cook
i
can
lay
hands
on
the
man
we
want
for
that
a
highway
boy
an
old
shipmate
of
mine
of
the
name
of
amalu
cooks
first
rate
and
always
better
to
have
a
native
he
aint
fly
you
can
turn
him
to
as
you
please
and
he
do
know
enough
to
stand
out
for
his
from
the
moment
that
captain
wicks
joined
in
the
conversation
carthew
recovered
interest
and
confidence
the
man
whatever
he
might
have
done
was
plainly
and
plainly
capable
if
he
thought
well
of
the
enterprise
offered
to
contribute
money
brought
experience
and
could
thus
solve
at
a
word
the
problem
of
the
trade
carthew
was
content
to
go
ahead
as
for
hadden
his
cup
was
full
he
and
bostock
forgave
each
other
in
champagne
toast
followed
toast
it
was
proposed
and
carried
amid
acclamation
to
change
the
name
of
the
schooner
when
she
should
be
bought
to
the
currency
lass
and
the
currency
lass
island
trading
company
was
practically
founded
before
dusk
three
days
later
carthew
stood
before
the
lawyer
still
in
his
jean
suit
received
his
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
and
proceeded
rather
timidly
to
ask
for
more
indulgence
have
a
chance
to
get
on
in
the
world
he
said
evening
i
expect
to
be
part
owner
of
a
property
carthew
said
the
lawyer
if
the
partners
work
her
themselves
and
stand
to
go
down
along
with
her
was
the
reply
conceive
it
possible
you
might
make
something
of
it
in
that
way
returned
the
other
are
you
a
seaman
i
thought
you
had
been
in
the
diplomatic
am
an
old
yachtsman
said
norris
i
must
do
the
best
i
can
a
fellow
ca
live
in
new
south
wales
upon
diplomacy
but
the
point
i
wish
to
prepare
you
for
is
this
it
will
be
impossible
i
should
present
myself
here
next
we
expect
to
make
a
six
months
cruise
of
it
among
the
carthew
i
ca
hear
of
that
replied
the
lawyer
mean
upon
the
same
conditions
as
the
last
said
carthew
conditions
are
exactly
opposite
said
the
lawyer
time
i
had
reason
to
know
you
were
in
the
colony
and
even
then
i
stretched
a
point
this
time
by
your
own
confession
you
are
contemplating
a
breach
of
the
agreement
and
i
give
you
warning
if
you
carry
it
out
and
i
receive
proof
of
it
for
i
will
agree
to
regard
this
conversation
as
confidential
i
shall
have
no
choice
but
to
do
my
duty
be
here
on
or
your
allowance
is
very
hard
and
i
think
rather
silly
returned
carthew
is
not
of
my
doing
i
have
my
instructions
said
the
lawyer
you
so
read
these
instructions
that
i
am
to
be
prohibited
from
making
an
honest
livelihood
asked
carthew
us
be
frank
said
the
lawyer
find
nothing
in
these
instructions
about
an
honest
livelihood
i
have
no
reason
to
suppose
my
clients
care
anything
about
that
i
have
reason
to
suppose
only
one
thing
that
they
mean
you
shall
stay
in
this
colony
and
to
guess
another
carthew
and
to
guess
do
you
mean
by
that
asked
norris
mean
that
i
imagine
on
very
strong
grounds
that
your
family
desire
to
see
no
more
of
you
said
the
lawyer
they
may
be
very
wrong
but
that
is
the
impression
conveyed
that
is
what
i
suppose
i
am
paid
to
bring
about
and
i
have
no
choice
but
to
try
and
earn
my
would
scorn
to
deceive
you
said
norris
with
a
strong
flush
have
guessed
rightly
my
family
refuse
to
see
me
but
i
am
not
going
to
england
i
am
going
to
the
islands
how
does
that
affect
the
islands
but
i
do
know
that
you
are
going
to
the
islands
said
the
lawyer
looking
down
and
spearing
the
with
a
pencil
beg
your
pardon
i
have
the
pleasure
of
informing
you
said
norris
am
afraid
carthew
that
i
can
not
regard
that
communication
as
official
was
the
slow
reply
am
not
accustomed
to
have
my
word
doubted
cried
norris
i
allow
no
one
to
raise
his
voice
in
my
office
said
the
lawyer
for
that
matter
you
seem
to
be
a
young
gentleman
of
sense
consider
what
i
know
of
you
you
are
a
discarded
son
your
family
pays
money
to
be
shut
of
you
what
have
you
done
i
do
know
but
do
you
not
see
how
foolish
i
should
be
if
i
exposed
my
business
reputation
on
the
safeguard
of
the
honour
of
a
gentleman
of
whom
i
know
just
so
much
and
no
more
this
interview
is
very
disagreeable
why
prolong
it
write
home
get
my
instructions
changed
and
i
will
change
my
behaviour
not
am
very
fond
of
three
hundred
a
year
said
norris
i
can
not
pay
the
price
required
i
shall
not
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
must
please
yourself
said
the
lawyer
to
be
here
next
and
the
thing
stops
but
i
warn
you
and
i
mean
the
warning
in
a
friendly
spirit
three
months
later
you
will
be
here
begging
and
i
shall
have
no
choice
but
to
show
you
in
the
wish
you
a
said
norris
same
to
you
carthew
retorted
the
lawyer
and
rang
for
his
clerk
so
it
befell
that
norris
during
what
remained
to
him
of
arduous
days
in
sydney
saw
not
again
the
face
of
his
legal
adviser
and
he
was
already
at
sea
and
land
was
out
of
sight
when
hadden
brought
him
a
sydney
paper
over
which
he
had
been
dozing
in
the
shadow
of
the
galley
and
showed
him
an
advertisement
norris
carthew
is
earnestly
entreated
to
call
without
delay
at
the
office
of
where
important
intelligence
awaits
must
manage
to
wait
for
me
six
months
said
norris
lightly
enough
but
yet
conscious
of
a
pang
of
curiosity
chapter
xxiii
the
budget
of
the
before
noon
on
the
november
there
cleared
from
the
port
of
sydney
the
schooner
currency
lass
the
owner
norris
carthew
was
on
board
in
the
somewhat
unusual
position
of
mate
the
master
name
purported
to
be
william
kirkup
the
cook
was
a
hawaiian
boy
joseph
amalu
and
there
were
two
hands
before
the
mast
thomas
hadden
and
richard
hemstead
the
latter
chosen
partly
because
of
his
humble
character
partly
because
he
had
an
handiness
with
tools
the
currency
lass
was
bound
for
the
south
sea
islands
and
first
of
all
for
butaritari
in
the
gilberts
on
a
register
but
it
was
understood
about
the
harbour
that
her
cruise
was
more
than
half
a
pleasure
trip
a
friend
of
the
late
grant
sanderson
of
auchentroon
and
kilclarty
might
have
recognised
in
that
ship
the
transformed
and
rechristened
dream
and
the
lloyd
surveyor
had
the
services
of
such
a
one
been
called
in
requisition
must
have
found
abundant
subject
of
remark
for
time
during
her
three
years
inaction
had
eaten
deep
into
the
dream
and
her
fittings
she
had
sold
in
consequence
a
shade
above
her
value
as
old
junk
and
the
three
adventurers
had
scarce
been
able
to
afford
even
the
most
vital
repairs
the
rigging
indeed
had
been
partly
renewed
and
the
rest
set
up
all
grant
sanderson
old
canvas
had
been
patched
together
into
one
decently
serviceable
suit
of
sails
grant
sanderson
masts
still
stood
and
might
have
wondered
at
themselves
have
the
heart
to
tap
them
captain
wicks
used
to
observe
as
he
squinted
up
their
height
or
patted
their
rotundity
and
rotten
as
our
was
an
accepted
metaphor
in
the
ship
company
the
sequel
rather
suggests
it
may
have
been
sounder
than
was
thought
but
no
one
knew
for
certain
just
as
no
one
except
the
captain
appreciated
the
dangers
of
the
cruise
the
captain
indeed
saw
with
clear
eyes
and
spoke
his
mind
aloud
and
though
a
man
of
an
astonishing
courage
following
life
and
taking
its
dangers
in
the
spirit
of
a
hound
upon
the
slot
he
had
made
a
point
of
a
big
whaleboat
your
choice
he
had
said
new
masts
and
rigging
or
that
boat
i
simply
ai
going
to
sea
without
the
one
or
the
other
chicken
coops
are
good
enough
no
doubt
and
so
is
a
dinghy
but
they
ai
for
and
his
partners
had
been
forced
to
consent
and
saw
six
and
thirty
pounds
of
their
small
capital
vanish
in
the
turn
of
a
hand
all
four
had
toiled
the
best
part
of
six
weeks
getting
ready
and
though
captain
wicks
was
of
course
not
seen
or
heard
of
a
fifth
was
there
to
help
them
a
fellow
in
a
bushy
red
beard
which
he
would
sometimes
lay
aside
when
he
was
below
and
who
strikingly
resembled
captain
wicks
in
voice
and
character
as
for
captain
kirkup
he
did
not
appear
till
the
last
moment
when
he
proved
to
be
a
burly
mariner
bearded
like
abou
ben
adhem
all
the
way
down
the
harbour
and
through
the
heads
his
whiskers
blew
in
the
wind
and
were
conspicuous
from
shore
but
the
currency
lass
had
no
sooner
turned
her
back
upon
the
lighthouse
than
he
went
below
for
the
inside
of
five
seconds
and
reappeared
clean
shaven
so
many
doublings
and
devices
were
required
to
get
to
sea
with
an
unseaworthy
ship
and
a
captain
that
was
nor
might
even
these
have
sufficed
but
for
the
fact
that
hadden
was
a
public
character
and
the
whole
cruise
regarded
with
an
eye
of
indulgence
as
one
of
tom
engaging
eccentricities
the
ship
besides
had
been
a
yacht
before
and
it
came
the
more
natural
to
allow
her
still
some
of
the
dangerous
liberties
of
her
old
employment
a
strange
ship
they
had
made
of
it
her
lofty
spars
disfigured
with
patched
canvas
her
panelled
cabin
fitted
for
a
traderoom
with
rude
shelves
and
the
life
they
led
in
that
anomalous
schooner
was
no
less
curious
than
herself
amalu
alone
berthed
forward
the
rest
occupied
staterooms
camped
upon
the
satin
divans
and
sat
down
in
grant
sanderson
parquetry
to
meals
of
junk
and
potatoes
bad
of
their
kind
and
often
scant
in
quantity
hemstead
grumbled
tommy
had
occasional
moments
of
revolt
and
increased
the
ordinary
by
a
few
haphazard
tins
or
a
bottle
of
his
own
brown
sherry
but
hemstead
grumbled
from
habit
tommy
revolted
only
for
the
moment
and
there
was
underneath
a
real
and
general
acquiescence
in
these
hardships
for
besides
onions
and
potatoes
the
currency
lass
may
be
said
to
have
gone
to
sea
without
stores
she
carried
two
thousand
pounds
worth
of
assorted
trade
advanced
on
credit
their
whole
hope
and
fortune
it
was
upon
this
that
they
subsisted
mice
in
their
own
granary
they
dined
upon
their
future
profits
and
every
scanty
meal
was
so
much
in
the
savings
bank
republican
as
were
their
manners
there
was
no
practical
at
least
no
dangerous
lack
of
discipline
wicks
was
the
only
sailor
on
board
there
was
none
to
criticise
and
besides
he
was
so
and
so
that
none
could
bear
to
disappoint
him
carthew
did
his
best
partly
for
the
love
of
doing
it
partly
for
love
of
the
captain
amalu
was
a
willing
drudge
and
even
hemstead
and
hadden
turned
to
upon
occasion
with
a
will
tommy
department
was
the
trade
and
traderoom
he
would
work
down
in
the
hold
or
over
the
shelves
of
the
cabin
till
the
sydney
dandy
was
unrecognizable
come
up
at
last
draw
a
bucket
of
bathe
change
and
lie
down
on
deck
over
a
big
sheaf
of
sydney
and
or
perhaps
with
a
volume
of
of
the
standard
work
selected
for
that
cruise
in
the
latter
case
a
smile
went
round
the
ship
for
buckle
almost
invariably
laid
his
student
out
and
when
tom
awoke
again
he
was
almost
always
in
the
humour
for
brown
sherry
the
connection
was
so
well
established
that
glass
of
or
bottle
of
became
current
pleasantries
on
board
the
currency
lass
hemstead
province
was
that
of
the
repairs
and
he
had
his
hands
full
nothing
on
board
but
was
decayed
in
a
proportion
the
lamps
leaked
so
did
the
decks
came
off
in
the
hand
mouldings
parted
company
with
the
panels
the
pump
declined
to
suck
and
the
defective
bathroom
came
near
to
swamp
the
ship
wicks
insisted
that
all
the
nails
were
long
ago
consumed
and
that
she
was
only
glued
together
by
the
rust
should
make
me
laugh
so
much
tommy
he
would
say
afraid
shake
the
sternpost
out
of
and
as
hemstead
went
to
and
fro
with
his
tool
basket
on
an
endless
round
of
tinkering
wicks
lost
no
opportunity
of
chaffing
him
upon
his
duties
you
turn
to
at
sailoring
or
washing
paint
or
something
useful
now
he
would
say
could
see
the
fun
of
it
but
to
be
mending
things
that
have
no
insides
to
them
appears
to
me
the
height
of
and
doubtless
these
continual
pleasantries
helped
to
reassure
the
landsmen
who
went
to
and
fro
unmoved
under
circumstances
that
might
have
daunted
nelson
the
weather
was
from
the
outset
splendid
and
the
wind
fair
and
steady
the
ship
sailed
like
a
witch
currency
lass
is
a
powerful
old
girl
and
has
more
complaints
than
i
would
care
to
put
a
name
on
the
captain
would
say
as
he
pricked
the
chart
she
could
show
her
blooming
heels
to
anything
of
her
size
in
the
western
to
wash
decks
relieve
the
wheel
do
the
day
work
after
dinner
on
the
table
and
take
in
kites
at
night
such
was
the
easy
routine
of
their
life
in
the
evening
above
all
if
tommy
had
produced
some
of
his
civilisation
yarns
and
music
were
the
rule
amalu
had
a
sweet
hawaiian
voice
and
hemstead
a
great
hand
upon
the
banjo
accompanied
his
own
quavering
tenor
with
effect
there
was
a
sense
in
which
the
little
man
could
sing
it
was
great
to
hear
him
deliver
boy
in
austrylian
and
the
words
some
of
the
worst
of
the
ruffian
macneil
were
hailed
in
his
version
with
inextinguishable
mirth
where
hye
ye
been
a
dye
he
would
ask
and
answer
himself
i
been
by
burn
and
flowery
brye
meadow
green
an
mountain
grye
courtin
o
this
young
thing
just
come
frye
her
mammie
it
was
the
accepted
jest
for
all
hands
to
greet
the
conclusion
of
this
song
with
the
simultaneous
cry
word
thus
winging
the
arrow
of
ridicule
with
a
feather
from
the
singer
wing
but
he
had
his
revenge
with
sweet
home
and
is
my
wandering
boy
ditties
into
which
he
threw
the
most
intolerable
pathos
it
appeared
he
had
no
home
nor
had
ever
had
one
nor
yet
any
vestige
of
a
family
except
a
truculent
uncle
a
baker
in
newcastle
his
domestic
sentiment
was
therefore
wholly
in
the
air
and
expressed
an
unrealised
ideal
or
perhaps
of
all
his
experiences
this
of
the
currency
lass
with
its
kindly
playful
and
tolerant
society
approached
it
the
most
nearly
it
is
perhaps
because
i
know
the
sequel
but
i
can
never
think
upon
this
voyage
without
a
profound
sense
of
pity
and
mystery
of
the
ship
once
the
whim
of
a
rich
blackguard
faring
with
her
battered
fineries
and
upon
her
homely
errand
across
the
plains
of
ocean
and
past
the
gorgeous
scenery
of
dawn
and
sunset
and
the
ship
company
so
strangely
assembled
so
britishly
filling
their
days
with
chaff
in
place
of
conversation
no
human
book
on
board
with
them
except
hadden
buckle
and
not
a
creature
fit
either
to
read
or
to
understand
it
and
the
one
mark
of
any
civilised
interest
being
when
carthew
filled
in
his
spare
hours
with
the
pencil
and
the
brush
the
whole
unconscious
crew
of
them
posting
in
the
meanwhile
towards
so
tragic
a
disaster
days
out
of
sydney
on
christmas
eve
they
fetched
up
to
the
entrance
of
the
lagoon
and
plied
all
that
night
outside
keeping
their
position
by
the
lights
of
fishers
on
the
reef
and
the
outlines
of
the
palms
against
the
cloudy
sky
with
the
break
of
day
the
schooner
was
hove
to
and
the
signal
for
a
pilot
shown
but
it
was
plain
her
lights
must
have
been
observed
in
the
darkness
by
the
native
fishermen
and
word
carried
to
the
settlement
for
a
boat
was
already
under
weigh
she
came
towards
them
across
the
lagoon
under
a
great
press
of
sail
lying
dangerously
down
so
that
at
times
in
the
heavier
puffs
they
thought
she
would
turn
turtle
covered
the
distance
in
fine
style
luffed
up
smartly
alongside
and
emitted
a
haggard
looking
white
man
in
pyjamas
said
he
when
he
had
made
good
his
entrance
was
taking
you
for
a
fiji
what
with
your
flush
decks
and
them
spars
well
all
here
wishing
you
a
merry
christmas
and
a
happy
new
year
he
added
and
lurched
against
a
stay
you
never
the
pilot
exclaimed
wicks
studying
him
with
a
profound
disfavour
never
taken
a
ship
in
do
tell
me
i
should
guess
i
have
returned
the
pilot
captain
dobbs
i
am
and
when
i
take
charge
the
captain
of
that
ship
can
go
below
and
man
alive
you
drunk
man
cried
the
captain
repeated
dobbs
ca
have
seen
much
life
if
you
call
me
drunk
i
only
just
beginning
come
night
i
wo
say
i
guess
i
be
properly
full
by
then
but
now
i
the
soberest
man
in
all
big
wo
do
retorted
wicks
for
joseph
sir
i
ca
have
you
piling
up
my
right
said
dobbs
and
rot
where
you
are
or
take
and
go
in
and
pile
her
up
for
yourself
like
the
captain
of
the
leslie
business
i
guess
grudged
me
twenty
dollars
pilotage
and
lost
twenty
thousand
in
trade
and
a
brand
new
schooner
ripped
the
keel
right
off
of
her
and
she
went
down
in
the
inside
of
four
minutes
and
lies
in
twenty
fathom
trade
and
all
this
cried
wicks
what
vessel
was
this
leslie
anyhow
to
cohen
and
from
returned
the
pilot
badly
wanted
there
a
barque
inside
filling
up
for
hamburg
you
see
her
spars
over
there
and
there
two
more
ships
due
all
the
way
from
germany
one
in
two
months
they
say
and
one
in
three
cohen
and
agent
that
topelius
has
taken
and
lain
down
with
the
jaundice
on
the
strength
of
it
i
guess
most
people
would
in
his
shoes
no
trade
no
copra
and
twenty
hundred
ton
of
shipping
due
if
you
any
copra
on
board
here
your
chance
topelius
will
buy
gold
down
and
give
three
cents
it
all
found
money
to
him
the
way
it
is
whatever
he
pays
for
it
and
that
what
come
of
going
back
on
the
me
one
moment
captain
dobbs
i
wish
to
speak
with
my
mate
said
the
captain
whose
face
had
begun
to
shine
and
his
eyes
to
sparkle
yourself
replied
the
pilot
could
think
of
offering
a
man
a
nip
could
you
just
to
brace
him
up
this
kind
of
thing
looks
damned
inhospitable
and
gives
a
schooner
a
bad
talk
about
that
after
the
anchor
down
returned
wicks
and
he
drew
carthew
forward
say
he
whispered
a
much
do
you
call
that
asked
carthew
ca
put
a
figure
on
it
yet
i
dare
said
the
captain
might
cruise
twenty
years
and
not
find
the
match
of
it
and
suppose
another
ship
came
in
everything
possible
and
the
difficulty
is
this
dobbs
he
as
drunk
as
a
marine
how
can
we
trust
him
we
insured
worse
luck
you
took
him
aloft
and
got
him
to
point
out
the
channel
suggested
carthew
he
tallied
at
all
with
the
chart
and
did
fall
out
of
the
rigging
perhaps
we
might
risk
all
risk
here
returned
the
captain
the
wheel
yourself
and
stand
by
mind
if
there
two
orders
follow
mine
not
his
set
the
cook
with
the
and
the
two
others
at
the
main
sheet
and
see
they
do
sit
on
with
that
he
called
the
pilot
they
swarmed
aloft
in
the
fore
rigging
and
presently
after
there
was
bawled
down
the
welcome
order
to
ease
sheets
and
fill
away
at
a
quarter
before
nine
on
christmas
morning
the
anchor
was
let
go
the
first
cruise
of
the
currency
lass
had
thus
ended
in
a
stroke
of
fortune
almost
beyond
hope
she
had
brought
two
thousand
pounds
worth
of
trade
straight
as
a
homing
pigeon
to
the
place
where
it
was
most
required
and
captain
wicks
or
rather
captain
kirkup
showed
himself
the
man
to
make
the
best
of
his
advantage
for
hard
upon
two
days
he
walked
a
verandah
with
topelius
for
hard
upon
two
days
his
partners
watched
from
the
neighbouring
public
house
the
field
of
battle
and
the
lamps
were
not
yet
lighted
on
the
evening
of
the
second
before
the
enemy
surrendered
wicks
came
across
to
the
sans
souci
as
the
saloon
was
called
his
face
nigh
black
his
eyes
almost
closed
and
all
bloodshot
and
yet
bright
as
lighted
matches
out
here
boys
he
said
and
when
they
were
some
way
off
among
the
palms
hold
he
added
in
a
voice
scarcely
recognizable
and
doubtless
referring
to
the
venerable
game
of
cribbage
do
you
mean
asked
tommy
sold
the
trade
answered
wicks
rather
i
sold
only
some
of
it
for
i
kept
back
all
the
mess
beef
and
half
the
flour
and
biscuit
and
by
god
we
still
provisioned
for
four
months
by
god
it
as
good
as
stolen
word
cried
hemstead
what
have
you
sold
it
for
gasped
carthew
the
captain
almost
insane
excitement
shaking
his
nerve
me
tell
it
my
own
way
cried
wicks
loosening
his
neck
me
get
at
it
gradual
or
i
explode
i
not
only
sold
it
boys
wrung
out
a
charter
on
my
own
terms
to
and
back
on
my
own
terms
i
made
a
point
of
it
i
fooled
him
first
by
making
believe
i
wanted
copra
which
of
course
i
knew
he
would
hear
of
could
in
fact
and
whenever
he
showed
fight
i
trotted
out
the
copra
and
that
man
dived
i
would
take
nothing
but
copra
you
see
and
so
i
got
the
blooming
lot
in
specie
all
but
two
short
bills
on
and
the
sum
well
this
whole
adventure
including
two
thousand
pounds
of
credit
cost
us
two
thousand
seven
hundred
and
some
odd
that
all
paid
back
in
thirty
days
cruise
we
paid
for
the
schooner
and
the
trade
heard
ever
any
man
the
match
of
that
and
it
not
all
for
besides
that
said
the
captain
hammering
his
words
got
thirteen
blooming
hundred
pounds
of
profit
to
divide
i
bled
him
in
four
thou
he
cried
in
a
voice
that
broke
like
a
schoolboy
for
a
moment
the
partners
looked
upon
their
chief
with
stupefaction
incredulous
surprise
their
only
feeling
tommy
was
the
first
to
grasp
the
consequences
he
said
in
a
hard
business
tone
back
to
that
saloon
i
got
to
get
must
please
excuse
me
boys
said
the
captain
earnestly
dare
taste
nothing
if
i
was
to
drink
one
glass
of
beer
it
my
belief
i
have
the
apoplexy
the
last
scrimmage
and
the
blooming
triumph
pretty
nigh
hand
done
then
three
cheers
for
the
captain
proposed
tommy
but
wicks
held
up
a
shaking
hand
that
either
boys
he
pleaded
of
the
other
buffer
and
let
him
down
easy
if
i
like
this
just
fancy
what
topelius
is
if
he
heard
us
singing
out
he
have
the
as
a
matter
of
fact
topelius
accepted
his
defeat
with
a
good
grace
but
the
crew
of
the
wrecked
leslie
who
were
in
the
same
employment
and
loyal
to
their
firm
took
the
thing
more
bitterly
rough
words
and
ugly
looks
were
common
once
even
they
hooted
captain
wicks
from
the
saloon
verandah
the
currency
lasses
drew
out
on
the
other
side
for
some
minutes
there
had
like
to
have
been
a
battle
in
butaritari
and
though
the
occasion
passed
off
without
blows
it
left
on
either
side
an
increase
of
no
such
small
matter
could
affect
the
happiness
of
the
successful
traders
five
days
more
the
ship
lay
in
the
lagoon
with
little
employment
for
any
one
but
tommy
and
the
captain
for
topelius
natives
discharged
cargo
and
brought
ballast
the
time
passed
like
a
pleasant
dream
the
adventurers
sat
up
half
the
night
debating
and
praising
their
good
fortune
or
strayed
by
day
in
the
narrow
isle
gaping
like
cockney
tourists
and
on
the
first
of
the
new
year
the
currency
lass
weighed
anchor
for
the
second
time
and
set
sail
for
attended
by
the
same
fine
weather
and
good
luck
she
crossed
the
doldrums
with
but
small
delay
on
a
wind
and
in
ballast
of
broken
coral
she
outdid
expectations
and
what
added
to
the
happiness
of
the
ship
company
the
small
amount
of
work
that
fell
on
them
to
do
was
now
lessened
by
the
presence
of
another
hand
this
was
the
boatswain
of
the
leslie
he
had
been
on
bad
terms
with
his
own
captain
had
already
spent
his
wages
in
the
saloons
of
butaritari
had
wearied
of
the
place
and
while
all
his
shipmates
coldly
refused
to
set
foot
on
board
the
currency
lass
he
had
offered
to
work
his
passage
to
the
coast
he
was
a
north
of
ireland
man
between
scotch
and
irish
rough
loud
humorous
and
emotional
not
without
sterling
qualities
and
an
expert
and
careful
sailor
his
frame
of
mind
was
different
indeed
from
that
of
his
new
shipmates
instead
of
making
an
unexpected
fortune
he
had
lost
a
berth
and
he
was
besides
disgusted
with
the
rations
and
really
appalled
at
the
condition
of
the
schooner
a
stateroom
door
had
stuck
the
first
day
at
sea
and
mac
as
they
called
him
laid
his
strength
to
it
and
plucked
it
from
the
hinges
said
he
ship
believe
you
my
boy
said
captain
wicks
the
next
day
the
sailor
was
observed
with
his
nose
aloft
you
get
looking
at
these
sticks
the
captain
said
have
a
fit
and
fall
mac
turned
towards
the
speaker
with
rather
a
wild
eye
i
see
what
looks
like
a
patch
of
dry
rot
up
yonder
that
i
bet
i
could
stick
my
fist
into
said
he
as
if
a
fellow
could
stick
his
head
into
it
do
it
returned
wicks
there
no
good
prying
into
things
that
ca
be
think
i
was
a
currency
ass
to
come
on
board
of
her
reflected
mac
i
never
said
she
was
seaworthy
replied
the
captain
only
said
she
could
show
her
blooming
heels
to
anything
afloat
and
besides
i
do
know
that
it
dry
rot
i
kind
of
sometimes
hope
it
is
here
turn
to
and
heave
the
log
that
cheer
you
there
no
denying
it
you
a
holy
captain
said
mac
and
from
that
day
on
he
made
but
the
one
reference
to
the
condition
and
that
was
whenever
tommy
drew
upon
his
cellar
to
the
junk
trade
he
would
say
as
he
held
out
his
can
of
sherry
do
you
always
say
that
asked
tommy
had
an
uncle
in
the
business
replied
mac
and
launched
at
once
into
a
yarn
in
which
an
incredible
number
of
the
characters
were
out
as
nice
as
you
would
want
to
see
and
the
oaths
made
up
about
of
every
conversation
only
once
he
gave
them
a
taste
of
his
violence
he
talked
of
it
indeed
often
rather
a
voilent
man
he
would
say
not
without
pride
but
this
was
the
only
specimen
of
a
sudden
he
turned
on
hemstead
in
the
ship
waist
knocked
him
against
the
foresail
boom
then
knocked
him
under
it
and
had
set
him
up
and
knocked
him
down
once
more
before
any
one
had
drawn
a
breath
belay
that
roared
wicks
leaping
to
his
feet
wo
have
none
of
mac
turned
to
the
captain
with
ready
civility
only
want
to
learn
him
manners
said
he
took
and
called
me
he
said
wicks
that
a
different
story
what
made
you
do
it
you
tomfool
you
ai
big
enough
to
call
any
man
did
call
him
it
spluttered
hemstead
through
his
blood
and
tears
only
he
let
have
no
more
of
it
said
wicks
you
are
irish
ai
you
carthew
asked
of
his
new
shipmate
shortly
after
may
be
replied
mac
i
allow
no
sydney
duck
to
call
me
so
no
he
added
with
a
sudden
heated
countenance
any
britisher
that
walks
why
look
here
he
went
on
a
young
swell
are
you
suppose
i
called
you
that
show
you
you
would
say
and
turn
to
and
take
it
out
of
me
on
the
of
january
when
in
lat
degrees
long
degrees
the
wind
chopped
suddenly
into
the
west
not
very
strong
but
puffy
and
with
flaws
of
rain
the
captain
eager
for
easting
made
a
fair
wind
of
it
and
guyed
the
booms
out
wing
and
wing
it
was
trick
at
the
wheel
and
as
it
was
within
half
an
hour
of
the
relief
seven
thirty
in
the
morning
the
captain
judged
it
not
worth
while
to
change
him
the
puffs
were
heavy
but
short
there
was
nothing
to
be
called
a
squall
no
danger
to
the
ship
and
scarce
more
than
usual
to
the
doubtful
spars
all
hands
were
on
deck
in
their
oilskins
expecting
breakfast
the
galley
smoked
the
ship
smelt
of
coffee
all
were
in
good
humour
to
be
speeding
eastward
a
full
nine
when
the
rotten
foresail
tore
suddenly
between
two
cloths
and
then
split
to
either
hand
it
was
for
all
the
world
as
though
some
archangel
with
a
huge
sword
had
slashed
it
with
the
figure
of
a
cross
all
hands
ran
to
secure
the
slatting
canvas
and
in
the
sudden
uproar
and
alert
tommy
hadden
lost
his
head
many
of
his
days
have
been
passed
since
then
in
explaining
how
the
thing
happened
of
these
explanations
it
will
be
sufficient
to
say
that
they
were
all
different
and
none
satisfactory
and
the
gross
fact
remains
that
the
main
boom
gybed
carried
away
the
tackle
broke
the
mainmast
some
three
feet
above
the
deck
and
whipped
it
overboard
for
near
a
minute
the
suspected
foremast
gallantly
resisted
then
followed
its
companion
and
by
the
time
the
wreck
was
cleared
of
the
whole
beautiful
fabric
that
enabled
them
to
skim
the
seas
two
ragged
stumps
remained
in
these
vast
and
solitary
waters
to
be
dismasted
is
perhaps
the
worst
calamity
let
the
ship
turn
turtle
and
go
down
and
at
least
the
pang
is
over
but
men
chained
on
a
hulk
may
pass
months
scanning
the
empty
sea
line
and
counting
the
steps
of
death
invisible
approach
there
is
no
help
but
in
the
boats
and
what
a
help
is
that
there
heaved
the
currency
lass
for
instance
a
wingless
lump
and
the
nearest
human
coast
that
of
kauai
in
the
sandwiches
lay
about
a
thousand
miles
to
south
and
east
of
her
over
the
way
there
to
men
contemplating
that
passage
in
an
open
boat
all
kinds
of
misery
and
the
fear
of
death
and
of
madness
brooded
a
serious
company
sat
down
to
breakfast
but
the
captain
helped
his
neighbours
with
a
smile
boys
he
said
after
a
pull
at
the
hot
coffee
done
with
this
currency
lass
and
no
mistake
one
good
job
we
made
her
pay
while
she
lasted
and
she
paid
first
rate
and
if
we
were
to
try
our
hand
again
we
can
try
in
style
another
good
job
we
have
a
fine
stiff
roomy
boat
and
you
know
who
you
have
to
thank
for
that
we
got
six
lives
to
save
and
a
pot
of
money
and
the
point
is
where
are
we
to
take
all
two
thousand
miles
to
the
nearest
of
the
sandwiches
i
fancy
observed
mac
not
so
bad
as
that
returned
the
captain
it
bad
enough
rather
a
know
a
man
who
once
did
twelve
hundred
in
a
boat
said
mac
he
had
all
he
wanted
he
fetched
ashore
in
the
marquesas
and
never
set
a
foot
on
anything
floating
from
that
day
to
this
he
said
he
would
rather
put
a
pistol
to
his
head
and
knock
his
brains
ay
said
wicks
i
remember
a
boat
crew
that
made
this
very
island
of
kauai
and
from
just
about
where
we
lie
or
a
bit
further
when
they
got
up
with
the
land
they
were
clean
crazy
there
was
an
coast
and
an
old
bob
ridley
of
a
surf
on
the
natives
hailed
from
and
sung
out
it
could
be
done
at
the
money
much
they
cared
there
was
the
land
that
was
all
they
knew
and
they
turned
to
and
drove
the
boat
slap
ashore
in
the
thick
of
it
and
was
all
drowned
but
one
no
boat
trips
are
my
eye
concluded
the
captain
gloomily
the
tone
was
surprising
in
a
man
of
his
indomitable
temper
captain
said
carthew
have
something
else
up
your
sleeve
out
with
it
a
fact
admitted
wicks
see
there
a
raft
of
little
bally
reefs
about
here
kind
of
on
the
chart
well
i
looked
all
up
and
there
one
midway
or
brooks
they
call
it
not
forty
mile
from
our
assigned
position
that
i
got
news
of
it
turns
out
it
a
coaling
station
of
the
pacific
mail
he
said
simply
and
i
know
it
ai
no
such
a
thing
said
mac
been
quartermaster
in
that
line
right
returned
wicks
the
book
read
what
hoyt
says
read
it
aloud
and
let
the
others
hoyt
falsehood
as
readers
know
was
explicit
incredulity
was
impossible
and
the
news
itself
delightful
beyond
hope
each
saw
in
his
mind
eye
the
boat
draw
in
to
a
trim
island
with
a
wharf
gardens
the
stars
and
stripes
and
the
white
cottage
of
the
keeper
saw
themselves
idle
a
few
weeks
in
tolerable
quarters
and
then
step
on
board
the
china
mail
romantic
waifs
and
yet
with
pocketsful
of
money
calling
for
champagne
and
waited
on
by
troops
of
stewards
breakfast
that
had
begun
so
dully
ended
amid
sober
jubilation
and
all
hands
turned
immediately
to
prepare
the
boat
now
that
all
spars
were
gone
it
was
no
easy
job
to
get
her
launched
some
of
the
necessary
cargo
was
first
stowed
on
board
the
specie
in
particular
being
packed
in
a
strong
chest
and
secured
with
lashings
to
the
afterthwart
in
case
of
a
capsize
then
a
piece
of
the
bulwark
was
razed
to
the
level
of
the
deck
and
the
boat
swung
made
fast
with
a
slack
line
to
either
stump
and
successfully
run
out
for
a
voyage
of
forty
miles
to
hospitable
quarters
not
much
food
or
water
was
required
but
they
took
both
in
superfluity
amalu
and
mac
both
ingrained
had
chests
which
were
the
headquarters
of
their
lives
two
more
chests
with
handbags
oilskins
and
blankets
supplied
the
others
hadden
amid
general
applause
added
the
last
case
of
the
brown
sherry
the
captain
brought
the
log
instruments
and
chronometer
nor
did
hemstead
forget
the
banjo
or
a
pinned
handkerchief
of
butaritari
shells
it
was
about
three
when
they
pushed
off
and
the
wind
being
still
westerly
fell
to
the
oars
we
got
the
guts
out
of
you
was
the
captain
nodded
farewell
to
the
hulk
of
the
currency
lass
which
presently
shrank
and
faded
in
the
sea
a
little
after
a
calm
succeeded
with
much
rain
and
the
first
meal
was
eaten
and
the
watch
below
lay
down
to
their
uneasy
slumber
on
the
bilge
under
a
roaring
the
dawned
overhead
from
out
of
ragged
clouds
there
is
no
moment
when
a
boat
at
sea
appears
so
trenchantly
black
and
so
conspicuously
little
and
the
crew
looked
about
them
at
the
sky
and
water
with
a
thrill
of
loneliness
and
fear
with
sunrise
the
trade
set
in
lusty
and
true
to
the
point
sail
was
made
the
boat
flew
and
by
about
four
in
the
afternoon
they
were
well
up
with
the
closed
part
of
the
reef
and
the
captain
standing
on
the
thwart
and
holding
by
the
mast
was
studying
the
island
through
the
binoculars
and
where
your
station
cried
mac
do
someway
pick
it
up
replied
the
captain
nor
never
will
retorted
mac
with
a
clang
of
despair
and
triumph
in
his
tones
the
truth
was
soon
plain
to
all
no
buoys
no
beacons
no
lights
no
coal
no
station
the
castaways
pulled
through
a
lagoon
and
landed
on
an
isle
where
was
no
mark
of
man
but
wreckwood
and
no
sound
but
of
the
sea
for
the
seafowl
that
harboured
and
lived
there
at
the
epoch
of
my
visit
were
then
scattered
into
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
ocean
and
had
left
no
traces
of
their
sojourn
besides
dropped
feathers
and
addled
eggs
it
was
to
this
they
had
been
sent
for
this
they
had
stooped
all
night
over
the
dripping
oars
hourly
moving
further
from
relief
the
boat
for
as
small
as
it
was
was
yet
eloquent
of
the
hands
of
men
a
thing
alone
indeed
upon
the
sea
but
yet
in
itself
all
human
and
the
isle
for
which
they
had
exchanged
it
was
ingloriously
savage
a
place
of
distress
solitude
and
hunger
unrelieved
there
was
a
strong
glare
and
shadow
of
the
evening
over
all
in
which
they
sat
or
lay
not
speaking
careless
even
to
eat
men
swindled
out
of
life
and
riches
by
a
lying
book
in
the
great
good
nature
of
the
whole
party
no
word
of
reproach
had
been
addressed
to
hadden
the
author
of
these
disasters
but
the
new
blow
was
less
magnanimously
borne
and
many
angry
glances
rested
on
the
captain
yet
it
was
himself
who
roused
them
from
their
lethargy
grudgingly
they
obeyed
drew
the
boat
beyond
tidemark
and
followed
him
to
the
top
of
the
miserable
islet
whence
a
view
was
commanded
of
the
whole
wheel
of
the
horizon
then
part
darkened
under
the
coming
night
part
dyed
with
the
hues
of
the
sunset
and
populous
with
the
sunset
clouds
here
the
camp
was
pitched
and
a
tent
run
up
with
the
oars
sails
and
mast
and
here
amalu
at
no
man
bidding
from
the
mere
instinct
of
habitual
service
built
a
fire
and
cooked
a
meal
night
was
come
and
the
stars
and
the
silver
sickle
of
new
moon
beamed
overhead
before
the
meal
was
ready
the
cold
sea
shone
about
them
and
the
fire
glowed
in
their
faces
as
they
ate
tommy
had
opened
his
case
and
the
brown
sherry
went
the
round
but
it
was
long
before
they
came
to
conversation
is
it
to
be
kauai
after
all
asked
mac
suddenly
is
bad
enough
for
me
said
tommy
stick
it
out
where
we
i
can
tell
ye
one
thing
said
mac
ye
care
to
hear
it
when
i
was
in
the
china
mail
we
once
made
this
island
it
in
the
course
from
it
is
cried
carthew
settles
it
then
let
stay
we
must
keep
good
fires
going
and
there
plenty
of
wreck
said
the
irishman
nothing
here
but
wreck
and
coffin
we
have
to
make
a
proper
blyze
objected
hemstead
see
a
fire
like
this
not
any
wye
awye
i
you
said
carthew
they
did
and
saw
the
hollow
of
the
night
the
bare
bright
face
of
the
sea
and
the
stars
regarding
them
and
the
voices
died
in
their
bosoms
at
the
spectacle
in
that
huge
isolation
it
seemed
they
must
be
visible
from
china
on
the
one
hand
and
california
on
the
other
god
it
dreary
whispered
hemstead
cried
mac
and
fell
suddenly
silent
better
than
a
boat
anyway
said
hadden
had
my
bellyful
of
kills
me
is
that
specie
the
captain
broke
out
of
all
that
riches
four
thousand
in
gold
bad
silver
and
short
bills
all
found
money
too
and
no
more
use
than
that
much
dung
tell
you
one
thing
said
tommy
do
like
it
being
in
the
boat
i
do
care
to
have
it
so
far
who
to
take
it
cried
mac
with
a
guffaw
of
evil
laughter
but
this
was
not
at
all
the
feeling
of
the
partners
who
rose
clambered
down
the
isle
brought
back
the
inestimable
slung
upon
two
oars
and
set
it
conspicuous
in
the
shining
of
the
fire
my
beauty
cried
wicks
viewing
it
with
a
cocked
head
better
than
a
bonfire
what
we
have
a
chest
here
and
bills
for
close
upon
two
thousand
pounds
there
no
show
to
that
it
would
go
in
your
but
the
rest
upwards
of
forty
pounds
avoirdupois
of
coined
gold
and
close
on
two
hundredweight
of
chile
silver
what
that
good
enough
to
fetch
a
fleet
do
you
mean
to
say
that
wo
affect
a
ship
compass
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
the
lookout
wo
turn
to
and
smell
it
he
cried
mac
who
had
no
part
nor
lot
in
the
bills
the
forty
pounds
of
gold
or
the
two
hundredweight
of
silver
heard
this
with
impatience
and
fell
into
a
bitter
choking
laughter
see
he
said
harshly
be
glad
to
feed
them
bills
into
the
fire
before
you
through
with
ut
and
he
turned
passed
by
himself
out
of
the
ring
of
the
firelight
and
stood
gazing
seaward
his
speech
and
his
departure
extinguished
instantly
those
sparks
of
better
humour
kindled
by
the
dinner
and
the
chest
the
group
fell
again
to
an
silence
and
hemstead
began
to
touch
the
banjo
as
was
his
habit
of
an
evening
his
repertory
was
small
the
chords
of
sweet
fell
under
his
fingers
and
when
he
had
played
the
symphony
he
instinctively
raised
up
his
voice
it
never
so
there
no
plyce
like
he
sang
the
last
word
was
still
upon
his
lips
when
the
instrument
was
snatched
from
him
and
dashed
into
the
fire
and
he
turned
with
a
cry
to
look
into
the
furious
countenance
of
mac
be
damned
if
i
stand
this
cried
the
captain
leaping
up
belligerent
told
ye
i
was
a
voilent
man
said
mac
with
a
movement
of
deprecation
very
surprising
in
one
of
his
character
do
he
give
me
a
chance
then
have
we
enough
to
bear
the
way
we
are
and
to
the
wonder
and
dismay
of
all
the
man
choked
upon
a
sob
ashamed
of
meself
i
am
he
said
presently
his
irish
accent
increased
ask
all
your
pardons
for
me
voilence
and
especially
the
little
man
who
is
a
harmless
crayture
and
here
me
hand
to
if
condescind
to
take
me
by
so
this
scene
of
barbarity
and
sentimentalism
passed
off
leaving
behind
strange
and
incongruous
impressions
true
every
one
was
perhaps
glad
when
silence
succeeded
that
all
too
appropriate
music
true
apology
and
subsequent
behaviour
rather
raised
him
in
the
opinion
of
his
but
the
discordant
note
had
been
struck
and
its
harmonics
tingled
in
the
brain
in
that
savage
houseless
isle
the
passions
of
man
had
sounded
if
only
for
the
moment
and
all
men
trembled
at
the
possibilities
of
horror
it
was
determined
to
stand
watch
and
watch
in
case
of
passing
vessels
and
tommy
on
fire
with
an
idea
volunteered
to
stand
the
first
the
rest
crawled
under
the
tent
and
were
soon
enjoying
that
comfortable
gift
of
sleep
which
comes
everywhere
and
to
all
men
quenching
anxieties
and
speeding
time
and
no
sooner
were
all
settled
no
sooner
had
the
drone
of
many
snorers
begun
to
mingle
with
and
overcome
the
surf
than
tommy
stole
from
his
post
with
the
case
of
sherry
and
dropped
it
in
a
quiet
cove
in
a
fathom
of
water
but
the
stormy
inconstancy
of
mac
behaviour
had
no
connection
with
a
gill
or
two
of
wine
his
passions
angry
and
otherwise
were
on
a
different
sail
plan
from
his
neighbours
and
there
were
possibilities
of
good
and
evil
in
that
hybrid
celt
beyond
their
prophecy
about
two
in
the
morning
the
starry
sky
or
so
it
seemed
for
the
drowsy
watchman
had
not
observed
the
approach
of
any
cloud
brimmed
over
in
a
deluge
and
for
three
days
it
rained
without
remission
the
islet
was
a
sponge
the
castaways
sops
the
view
all
gone
even
the
reef
concealed
behind
the
curtain
of
the
falling
water
the
fire
was
soon
drowned
out
after
a
couple
of
boxes
of
matches
had
been
scratched
in
vain
it
was
decided
to
wait
for
better
weather
and
the
party
lived
in
wretchedness
on
raw
tins
and
a
ration
of
hard
bread
by
the
february
in
the
dark
hours
of
the
morning
watch
the
clouds
were
all
blown
by
the
sun
rose
glorious
and
once
more
the
castaways
sat
by
a
quick
fire
and
drank
hot
coffee
with
the
greed
of
brutes
and
sufferers
thenceforward
their
affairs
moved
in
a
routine
a
fire
was
constantly
maintained
and
this
occupied
one
hand
continuously
and
the
others
for
an
hour
or
so
in
the
day
twice
a
day
all
hands
bathed
in
the
lagoon
their
chief
almost
their
only
pleasure
often
they
fished
in
the
lagoon
with
good
success
and
the
rest
was
passed
in
lolling
strolling
yarns
and
disputation
the
time
of
the
china
steamers
was
calculated
to
a
nicety
which
done
the
thought
was
rejected
and
ignored
it
was
one
that
would
not
bear
consideration
the
boat
voyage
having
been
tacitly
set
aside
the
desperate
part
chosen
to
wait
there
for
the
coming
of
help
or
of
starvation
no
man
had
courage
left
to
look
his
bargain
in
the
face
far
less
to
discuss
it
with
his
neighbours
but
the
unuttered
terror
haunted
them
in
every
hour
of
idleness
at
every
moment
of
silence
it
returned
and
breathed
a
chill
about
the
circle
and
carried
men
eyes
to
the
horizon
then
in
a
panic
of
they
would
rally
to
some
other
subject
and
in
that
lone
spot
what
else
was
to
be
found
to
speak
of
but
the
treasure
that
was
indeed
the
chief
singularity
the
one
thing
conspicuous
in
their
island
life
the
presence
of
that
chest
of
bills
and
specie
dominated
the
mind
like
a
cathedral
and
there
were
besides
connected
with
it
certain
irking
problems
well
fitted
to
occupy
the
idle
two
thousand
pounds
were
due
to
the
sydney
firm
two
thousand
pounds
were
clear
profit
and
fell
to
be
divided
in
varying
proportions
among
six
it
had
been
agreed
how
the
partners
were
to
range
every
pound
of
capital
subscribed
every
pound
that
fell
due
in
wages
was
to
count
for
one
of
these
tommy
could
claim
five
hundred
and
ten
carthew
one
hundred
and
seventy
wicks
one
hundred
and
forty
and
hemstead
and
amalu
ten
apiece
eight
hundred
and
forty
in
all
what
was
the
value
of
a
lay
this
was
at
first
debated
in
the
air
and
chiefly
by
the
strength
of
tommy
lungs
then
followed
a
series
of
incorrect
calculations
from
which
they
issued
arithmetically
foiled
but
agreed
from
weariness
upon
an
approximate
value
of
pounds
shillings
pence
the
figures
were
admittedly
incorrect
the
sum
of
the
shares
came
not
to
pounds
but
to
pounds
shillings
pounds
shillings
being
thus
left
unclaimed
but
it
was
the
nearest
they
had
yet
found
and
the
highest
as
well
so
that
the
partners
were
made
the
less
critical
by
the
contemplation
of
their
splendid
dividends
wicks
put
in
pounds
and
stood
to
draw
captain
wages
for
two
months
his
taking
was
pounds
shillings
pence
carthew
had
put
in
pounds
he
was
to
take
out
pounds
shillings
pence
tommy
pounds
had
grown
to
be
pounds
shillings
pence
and
amalu
and
hemstead
ranking
for
wages
only
had
pounds
shillings
pence
each
from
talking
and
brooding
on
these
figures
it
was
but
a
step
to
opening
the
chest
and
once
the
chest
open
the
glamour
of
the
cash
was
irresistible
each
felt
that
he
must
see
his
treasure
separate
with
the
eye
of
flesh
handle
it
in
the
hard
coin
mark
it
for
his
own
and
stand
forth
to
himself
the
approved
owner
and
here
an
insurmountable
difficulty
barred
the
way
there
were
some
seventeen
shillings
in
english
silver
the
rest
was
chile
and
the
chile
dollar
which
had
been
taken
at
the
rate
of
six
to
the
pound
sterling
was
practically
their
smallest
coin
it
was
decided
therefore
to
divide
the
pounds
only
and
to
throw
the
shillings
pence
and
fractions
in
a
common
fund
this
with
the
three
pound
fourteen
already
in
the
heel
made
a
total
of
seven
pounds
one
shilling
tell
you
said
wicks
carthew
and
tommy
and
me
take
one
pound
apiece
and
hemstead
and
amalu
split
the
other
four
and
toss
up
for
the
odd
rot
said
carthew
and
i
are
bursting
already
we
can
take
half
a
sov
each
and
let
the
other
three
have
forty
tell
you
now
it
not
worth
splitting
broke
in
mac
cards
in
my
chest
why
do
you
play
for
the
slump
sum
in
that
idle
place
the
proposal
was
accepted
with
delight
mac
as
the
owner
of
the
cards
was
given
a
stake
the
sum
was
played
for
in
five
games
of
cribbage
and
when
amalu
the
last
survivor
in
the
tournament
was
beaten
by
mac
it
was
found
the
dinner
hour
was
past
after
a
hasty
meal
they
fell
again
immediately
to
cards
this
time
on
proposal
to
van
john
it
was
then
probably
two
of
the
february
and
they
played
with
varying
chances
for
twelve
hours
slept
heavily
and
rose
late
on
the
morrow
to
resume
the
game
all
day
of
the
with
grudging
intervals
for
food
and
with
one
long
absence
on
the
part
of
tommy
from
which
he
returned
dripping
with
the
case
of
sherry
they
continued
to
deal
and
stake
night
fell
they
drew
the
closer
to
the
fire
it
was
maybe
two
in
the
morning
and
tommy
was
selling
his
deal
by
auction
as
usual
with
that
timid
player
when
carthew
who
did
intend
to
bid
had
a
moment
of
leisure
and
looked
round
him
he
beheld
the
moonlight
on
the
sea
the
money
piled
and
scattered
in
that
incongruous
place
the
perturbed
faces
of
the
players
he
felt
in
his
own
breast
the
familiar
tumult
and
it
seemed
as
if
there
rose
in
his
ears
a
sound
of
music
and
the
moon
seemed
still
to
shine
upon
a
sea
but
the
sea
was
changed
and
the
casino
towered
from
among
lamplit
gardens
and
the
money
clinked
on
the
green
board
god
he
thought
i
gambling
again
he
looked
the
more
curiously
about
the
sandy
table
he
and
mac
had
played
and
won
like
gamblers
the
mingled
gold
and
silver
lay
by
their
places
in
the
heap
amalu
and
hemstead
had
each
more
than
held
their
own
but
tommy
was
cruel
far
to
leeward
and
the
captain
was
reduced
to
perhaps
fifty
pounds
say
let
knock
off
said
carthew
that
man
a
glass
of
buckle
said
some
one
and
a
fresh
bottle
was
opened
and
the
game
went
inexorably
on
carthew
was
himself
too
heavy
a
winner
to
withdraw
or
to
say
more
and
all
the
rest
of
the
night
he
must
look
on
at
the
progress
of
this
folly
and
make
gallant
attempts
to
lose
with
the
not
uncommon
consequence
of
winning
more
the
first
dawn
of
the
february
found
him
desperate
it
chanced
he
was
then
dealer
and
still
winning
he
had
just
dealt
a
round
of
many
tens
every
one
had
staked
heavily
the
captain
had
put
up
all
that
remained
to
him
twelve
pounds
in
gold
and
a
few
dollars
and
carthew
looking
privately
at
his
cards
before
he
showed
them
found
he
held
a
natural
here
you
fellows
he
broke
out
is
a
sickening
business
and
i
done
with
it
for
so
saying
he
showed
his
cards
tore
them
across
and
rose
from
the
ground
the
company
stared
and
murmured
in
mere
amazement
but
mac
stepped
gallantly
to
his
support
had
enough
of
it
i
do
believe
said
he
of
course
it
was
all
fun
and
here
my
counters
back
all
counters
in
boys
and
he
began
to
pour
his
winnings
into
the
chest
which
stood
fortunately
near
him
carthew
stepped
across
and
wrung
him
by
the
hand
never
forget
this
he
said
what
are
ye
going
to
do
with
the
highway
boy
and
the
plumber
inquired
mac
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
both
wan
ye
true
said
carthew
aloud
and
hemstead
count
your
winnings
tommy
and
i
pay
it
was
carried
without
speech
the
pair
glad
enough
to
receive
their
winnings
it
mattered
not
from
whence
and
tommy
who
had
lost
about
five
hundred
pounds
delighted
with
the
compromise
how
about
mac
asked
hemstead
he
to
lose
all
beg
your
pardon
plumber
i
sure
ye
mean
well
returned
the
irishman
you
better
shut
your
face
for
i
not
that
kind
of
a
man
if
i
i
had
wan
that
money
fair
there
never
a
soul
here
could
get
it
from
me
but
i
it
was
in
fun
that
was
my
mistake
ye
see
and
there
no
man
big
enough
upon
this
island
to
give
a
present
to
my
mother
son
so
there
my
opinion
to
ye
plumber
and
you
can
put
it
in
your
pockut
till
i
will
say
mac
you
a
gentleman
said
carthew
as
he
helped
him
to
shovel
back
his
winnings
into
the
treasure
chest
a
fear
of
it
sir
a
drunken
said
mac
the
captain
had
sat
somewhile
with
his
face
in
his
hands
now
he
rose
mechanically
shaking
and
stumbling
like
a
drunkard
after
a
debauch
but
as
he
rose
his
face
was
altered
and
his
voice
rang
out
over
the
isle
ho
all
turned
at
the
cry
and
there
in
the
wild
light
of
the
morning
heading
straight
for
midway
reef
was
the
brig
flying
scud
of
hull
chapter
xxiv
a
hard
bargain
the
ship
which
thus
appeared
before
the
castaways
had
long
the
ocean
wandering
from
one
port
to
another
as
freights
offered
she
was
two
years
out
from
london
by
the
cape
of
good
hope
india
and
the
archipelago
and
was
now
bound
for
san
francisco
in
the
hope
of
working
homeward
round
the
horn
her
captain
was
one
jacob
trent
he
had
retired
some
five
years
before
to
a
suburban
cottage
a
patch
of
cabbages
a
gig
and
the
conduct
of
what
he
called
a
bank
the
name
appears
to
have
been
misleading
borrowers
were
accustomed
to
choose
works
of
art
and
utility
in
the
front
shop
loaves
of
sugar
and
bolts
of
broadcloth
were
deposited
in
pledge
and
it
was
a
part
of
the
manager
duty
to
dash
in
his
gig
on
saturday
evenings
from
one
small
retailer
to
another
and
to
annex
in
each
the
bulk
of
the
week
takings
his
was
thus
an
active
life
and
to
a
man
of
the
type
of
a
rat
filled
with
recondite
joys
an
unexpected
loss
a
law
suit
and
the
unintelligent
commentary
of
the
judge
upon
the
bench
combined
to
disgust
him
of
the
business
i
was
so
extraordinarily
fortunate
as
to
find
in
an
old
newspaper
a
report
of
the
proceedings
in
lyall
the
cardiff
mutual
accommodation
banking
confess
i
fail
entirely
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
business
the
judge
had
remarked
while
trent
was
being
examined
in
chief
a
little
after
on
fuller
information
call
it
a
bank
he
had
opined
it
seems
to
me
to
be
an
unlicensed
and
he
wound
up
with
this
appalling
allocution
trent
i
must
put
you
on
your
guard
you
must
be
very
careful
or
we
shall
see
you
here
in
the
inside
of
a
week
the
captain
disposed
of
the
bank
the
cottage
and
the
gig
and
horse
and
to
sea
again
in
the
flying
scud
where
he
did
well
and
gave
high
satisfaction
to
his
owners
but
the
glory
clung
to
him
he
was
a
plain
he
said
but
he
could
never
long
allow
you
to
forget
that
he
had
been
a
banker
his
mate
elias
goddedaal
was
a
huge
viking
of
a
man
six
feet
three
and
of
proportionate
mass
strong
sober
industrious
musical
and
sentimental
he
ran
continually
over
into
swedish
melodies
chiefly
in
the
minor
he
had
paid
nine
dollars
to
hear
patti
to
hear
nilsson
he
had
deserted
a
ship
and
two
months
wages
and
he
was
ready
at
any
time
to
walk
ten
miles
for
a
good
concert
or
seven
to
a
reasonable
play
on
board
he
had
three
treasures
a
canary
bird
a
concertina
and
a
blinding
copy
of
the
works
of
shakespeare
he
had
a
gift
peculiarly
scandinavian
of
making
friends
at
sight
an
elemental
innocence
commended
him
he
was
without
fear
without
reproach
and
without
money
or
the
hope
of
making
it
holdorsen
was
second
mate
and
berthed
aft
but
messed
usually
with
the
hands
of
one
more
of
the
crew
some
image
lives
this
was
a
foremast
hand
out
of
the
clyde
of
the
name
of
brown
a
small
dark
thickset
creature
with
dog
eyes
of
a
disposition
incomparably
mild
and
harmless
he
knocked
about
seas
and
cities
the
uncomplaining
whiptop
of
one
vice
drink
is
my
trouble
ye
see
he
said
to
carthew
shyly
the
more
shame
to
me
because
i
come
of
very
good
people
at
bowling
down
the
the
letter
that
so
much
affected
nares
in
case
the
reader
should
remember
it
was
addressed
to
this
man
brown
such
was
the
ship
that
now
carried
joy
into
the
bosoms
of
the
castaways
after
the
fatigue
and
the
bestial
emotions
of
their
night
of
play
the
approach
of
salvation
shook
them
from
all
their
hands
trembled
their
eyes
shone
they
laughed
and
shouted
like
children
as
they
cleared
their
camp
and
some
one
beginning
to
whistle
through
georgia
the
remainder
of
the
packing
was
conducted
amidst
a
thousand
interruptions
to
these
martial
strains
but
the
strong
head
of
wicks
was
only
partly
turned
he
said
all
we
going
aboard
of
a
ship
of
which
we
do
know
nothing
we
got
a
chest
of
specie
and
seeing
the
weight
we
ca
turn
to
and
deny
it
now
suppose
she
was
fishy
suppose
it
was
some
kind
of
a
bully
hayes
business
it
my
opinion
we
better
be
on
hand
with
the
every
man
of
the
party
but
hemstead
had
some
kind
of
a
revolver
these
were
accordingly
loaded
and
disposed
about
the
persons
of
the
castaways
and
the
packing
was
resumed
and
finished
in
the
same
rapturous
spirit
as
it
was
begun
the
sun
was
not
yet
ten
degrees
above
the
eastern
sea
but
the
brig
was
already
close
in
and
hove
to
before
they
had
launched
the
boat
and
sped
shouting
at
the
oars
towards
the
passage
it
was
blowing
fresh
outside
with
a
strong
send
of
sea
the
spray
flew
in
the
oarsmen
faces
they
saw
the
union
jack
blow
abroad
from
the
flying
scud
the
men
clustered
at
the
rail
the
cook
in
the
galley
door
the
captain
on
the
with
a
pith
helmet
and
binoculars
and
the
whole
familiar
business
the
comfort
company
and
safety
of
a
ship
heaving
nearer
at
each
stroke
maddened
them
with
joy
wicks
was
the
first
to
catch
the
line
and
swarm
on
board
helping
hands
grabbing
him
as
he
came
and
hauling
him
across
the
rail
sir
i
suppose
he
said
turning
to
the
hard
old
man
in
the
pith
helmet
trent
sir
returned
the
old
gentleman
i
captain
kirkup
and
this
is
the
crew
of
the
sydney
schooner
currency
lass
dismasted
at
sea
january
ay
said
trent
you
all
right
now
lucky
for
you
i
saw
your
signal
i
did
know
i
was
so
near
this
beastly
island
there
must
be
a
drift
to
the
here
and
when
i
came
on
deck
this
morning
at
eight
bells
i
thought
it
was
a
ship
it
had
been
agreed
that
while
wicks
was
to
board
the
ship
and
do
the
civil
the
rest
were
to
remain
in
the
whaleboat
and
see
the
treasure
safe
a
tackle
was
passed
down
to
them
to
this
they
made
fast
the
invaluable
chest
and
gave
the
word
to
heave
but
the
unexpected
weight
brought
the
hand
at
the
tackle
to
a
stand
two
others
ran
to
tail
on
and
help
him
and
the
thing
caught
the
eye
of
trent
heaving
he
cried
sharply
and
then
to
wicks
that
i
do
ever
remember
to
have
seen
a
chest
weigh
like
money
said
wicks
what
cried
trent
said
wicks
from
the
trent
looked
at
him
sharply
let
go
that
chest
again
goddedaal
he
commanded
the
boat
off
and
stream
her
with
a
line
ay
sir
from
goddedaal
the
devil
wrong
asked
wicks
i
daresay
returned
trent
you
allow
it
a
queer
thing
when
a
boat
turns
up
in
with
half
a
ton
of
specie
and
everybody
armed
he
added
pointing
to
wicks
pocket
boat
will
lay
comfortably
astern
while
you
come
below
and
make
yourself
if
that
all
said
wicks
log
and
papers
are
as
right
as
the
mail
nothing
fishy
about
and
he
hailed
his
friends
in
the
boat
bidding
them
have
patience
and
turned
to
follow
captain
trent
way
captain
kirkup
said
the
latter
do
blame
a
man
for
too
much
caution
no
offence
intended
and
these
china
rivers
shake
a
fellow
nerve
all
i
want
is
just
to
see
you
what
you
say
you
are
it
only
my
duty
sir
and
what
you
would
do
yourself
in
the
circumstances
i
not
always
been
a
i
was
a
banker
once
and
i
tell
you
that
the
trade
to
learn
caution
in
you
have
to
keep
your
lifting
saturday
and
with
a
dry
cordiality
he
produced
a
bottle
of
gin
the
captains
pledged
each
other
the
papers
were
overhauled
the
tale
of
topelius
and
the
trade
was
told
in
appreciative
ears
and
cemented
their
acquaintance
trent
suspicions
thus
finally
disposed
of
were
succeeded
by
a
fit
of
profound
thought
during
which
he
sat
lethargic
and
stern
looking
at
and
drumming
on
the
table
more
asked
wicks
sort
of
a
place
is
it
inside
inquired
trent
sudden
as
though
wicks
had
touched
a
spring
a
good
enough
lagoon
a
few
horses
heads
but
nothing
to
mention
answered
wicks
a
good
mind
to
go
in
said
trent
was
new
rigged
in
china
it
given
very
bad
and
i
getting
frightened
for
my
sticks
we
could
set
it
up
as
good
as
new
in
a
day
for
i
daresay
your
lot
would
turn
to
and
give
us
a
hand
see
if
we
do
said
wicks
be
it
then
concluded
trent
stitch
in
time
saves
they
returned
on
deck
wicks
cried
the
news
to
the
currency
lasses
the
foretopsail
was
filled
again
and
the
brig
ran
into
the
lagoon
lively
the
whaleboat
dancing
in
her
wake
and
came
to
single
anchor
off
middle
brooks
island
before
eight
she
was
boarded
by
the
castaways
breakfast
was
served
the
baggage
slung
on
board
and
piled
in
the
waist
and
all
hands
turned
to
upon
the
rigging
all
day
the
work
continued
the
two
crews
rivalling
each
other
in
expense
of
strength
dinner
was
served
on
deck
the
officers
messing
aft
under
the
slack
of
the
spanker
the
men
fraternising
forward
trent
appeared
in
excellent
spirits
served
out
grog
to
all
hands
opened
a
bottle
of
cape
wine
for
the
and
obliged
his
guests
with
many
details
of
the
life
of
a
financier
in
cardiff
he
had
been
forty
years
at
sea
had
five
times
suffered
shipwreck
was
once
nine
months
the
prisoner
of
a
pepper
rajah
and
had
seen
service
under
fire
in
chinese
rivers
but
the
only
thing
he
cared
to
talk
of
the
only
thing
of
which
he
was
vain
or
with
which
he
thought
it
possible
to
interest
a
stranger
was
his
career
as
a
in
the
slums
of
a
seaport
town
the
afternoon
spell
told
cruelly
on
the
currency
lasses
already
exhausted
as
they
were
with
sleeplessness
and
excitement
they
did
the
last
hours
of
this
violent
employment
on
bare
nerves
and
when
trent
was
at
last
satisfied
with
the
condition
of
his
rigging
expected
eagerly
the
word
to
put
to
sea
but
the
captain
seemed
in
no
hurry
he
went
and
walked
by
himself
softly
like
a
man
in
thought
presently
he
hailed
wicks
a
kind
of
company
ai
you
captain
kirkup
he
inquired
we
all
on
board
on
lays
was
the
reply
then
you
wo
mind
if
i
ask
the
lot
of
you
down
to
tea
in
the
cabin
asked
trent
wicks
was
amazed
but
he
naturally
ventured
no
remark
and
a
little
after
the
six
currency
lasses
sat
down
with
trent
and
goddedaal
to
a
spread
of
marmalade
butter
toast
sardines
tinned
tongue
and
steaming
tea
the
food
was
not
very
good
and
i
have
no
doubt
nares
would
have
reviled
it
but
it
was
manna
to
the
castaways
goddedaal
waited
on
them
with
a
kindness
far
before
courtesy
a
kindness
like
that
of
some
old
honest
countrywoman
in
her
farm
it
was
remembered
afterwards
that
trent
took
little
share
in
these
attentions
but
sat
much
absorbed
in
thought
and
seemed
to
remember
and
forget
the
presence
of
his
guests
alternately
presently
he
addressed
the
chinaman
out
said
he
and
watched
him
till
he
had
disappeared
in
the
stair
gentlemen
he
went
on
understand
you
a
sort
of
crew
and
that
why
i
had
you
all
down
for
there
a
point
i
want
made
clear
you
see
what
sort
of
a
ship
this
is
a
good
ship
though
i
say
it
and
you
see
what
the
rations
are
good
enough
for
there
was
a
hurried
murmur
of
approval
but
curiosity
for
what
was
coming
next
prevented
an
articulate
reply
continued
trent
making
bread
pills
and
looking
hard
at
the
middle
of
the
table
glad
of
course
to
be
able
to
give
you
a
passage
to
one
should
help
another
that
my
motto
but
when
you
want
a
thing
in
this
world
you
generally
always
have
to
pay
for
he
laughed
a
brief
joyless
laugh
have
no
idea
of
losing
by
my
have
no
idea
you
should
captain
said
wicks
are
ready
to
pay
anything
in
reason
added
carthew
at
the
words
goddedaal
who
sat
next
to
him
touched
him
with
his
elbow
and
the
two
mates
exchanged
a
significant
look
the
character
of
captain
trent
was
given
and
taken
in
that
silent
second
reason
repeated
the
captain
of
the
brig
was
waiting
for
that
reason
between
two
people
and
there
only
one
here
i
the
judge
i
reason
if
you
want
an
advance
you
have
to
pay
for
he
hastily
corrected
himself
you
want
a
passage
in
my
ship
you
have
to
pay
my
price
he
substituted
business
i
believe
i
do
want
you
you
want
sir
said
carthew
what
is
your
price
the
captain
made
bread
pills
i
were
like
you
he
said
you
got
hold
of
that
merchant
in
the
gilberts
i
might
surprise
you
you
had
your
chance
then
seems
to
me
it
mine
now
turn
about
fair
play
what
kind
of
mercy
did
you
have
on
that
gilbert
merchant
he
cried
with
a
sudden
stridency
that
i
blame
you
all
fair
in
love
and
business
and
he
laughed
again
a
little
frosty
giggle
sir
said
carthew
gravely
this
ship
mine
i
think
he
asked
sharply
i
of
that
way
of
thinking
meself
observed
mac
say
it
mine
sir
reiterated
trent
like
a
man
trying
to
be
angry
i
tell
you
all
if
i
was
a
driver
like
what
you
are
i
would
take
the
lot
but
there
two
thousand
pounds
there
that
do
belong
to
you
and
i
an
honest
man
give
me
the
two
thousand
that
yours
and
give
you
a
passage
to
the
coast
and
land
every
of
you
in
with
fifteen
pounds
in
his
pocket
and
the
captain
here
with
goddedaal
laid
down
his
head
on
the
table
like
a
man
ashamed
joking
said
wicks
purple
in
the
face
i
said
trent
yourselves
you
under
no
compulsion
this
ship
mine
but
there
that
brooks
island
do
belong
to
me
and
you
can
lay
there
till
you
die
for
what
i
more
than
your
blooming
brig
worth
cried
wicks
my
price
anyway
returned
trent
do
you
mean
to
say
you
would
land
us
there
to
starve
cried
tommy
captain
trent
laughed
the
third
time
i
defy
you
to
said
he
sell
you
all
the
provisions
you
want
at
a
fair
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
mac
my
case
is
by
itself
working
me
passage
i
got
no
share
in
that
two
thousand
pounds
nor
nothing
in
my
pockut
and
i
be
glad
to
know
what
you
have
to
say
to
me
ai
a
hard
man
said
trent
shall
make
no
difference
take
you
with
the
rest
only
of
course
you
get
no
fifteen
the
impudence
was
so
extreme
and
startling
that
all
breathed
deep
and
goddedaal
raised
up
his
face
and
looked
his
superior
sternly
in
the
eye
but
mac
was
more
articulate
you
what
ye
call
a
british
sayman
i
suppose
the
sorrow
in
your
guts
he
cried
more
such
word
and
i
clap
you
in
irons
said
trent
rising
gleefully
at
the
face
of
opposition
where
would
i
be
the
while
you
were
doin
ut
asked
mac
you
and
your
rigging
too
ye
ould
puggy
ye
have
the
civility
of
a
bug
and
i
learn
ye
his
voice
did
not
even
rise
as
he
uttered
the
threat
no
man
present
trent
least
of
all
expected
that
which
followed
the
irishman
hand
rose
suddenly
from
below
the
table
an
open
balanced
on
the
palm
there
was
a
movement
swift
as
conjuring
trent
started
half
to
his
feet
turning
a
little
as
he
rose
so
as
to
escape
the
table
and
the
movement
was
his
bane
the
missile
struck
him
in
the
jugular
he
fell
forward
and
his
blood
flowed
among
the
dishes
on
the
cloth
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
and
the
catastrophe
the
instant
change
from
peace
to
war
and
from
life
to
death
held
all
men
spellbound
yet
a
moment
they
sat
about
the
table
staring
upon
the
prostrate
captain
and
the
flowing
blood
the
next
goddedaal
had
leaped
to
his
feet
caught
up
the
stool
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
and
swung
it
high
in
air
a
man
transfigured
roaring
as
he
stood
so
that
ears
were
stunned
with
it
there
was
no
thought
of
battle
in
the
currency
lasses
none
drew
his
weapon
all
huddled
helplessly
from
before
the
face
of
the
baresark
scandinavian
his
first
blow
sent
mac
to
ground
with
a
broken
arm
his
second
bashed
out
the
brains
of
hemstead
he
turned
from
one
to
another
menacing
and
trumpeting
like
a
wounded
elephant
exulting
in
his
rage
but
there
was
no
counsel
no
light
of
reason
in
that
ecstasy
of
battle
and
he
shied
from
the
pursuit
of
victory
to
hail
fresh
blows
upon
the
supine
hemstead
so
that
the
stool
was
shattered
and
the
cabin
rang
with
their
violence
the
sight
of
that
cruelty
recalled
carthew
to
the
life
of
instinct
and
his
revolver
was
in
hand
and
he
had
aimed
and
fired
before
he
knew
the
sound
of
the
report
was
accompanied
by
a
yell
of
pain
the
colossus
paused
swayed
tottered
and
fell
headlong
on
the
body
of
his
victim
in
the
instant
silence
that
succeeded
the
sound
of
feet
pounding
on
the
deck
and
in
the
companion
leaped
into
hearing
and
a
face
that
of
the
sailor
holdorsen
appeared
below
the
bulkheads
in
the
cabin
doorway
carthew
shattered
it
with
a
second
shot
for
he
was
a
marksman
he
cried
and
charged
at
the
companion
wicks
at
his
heels
tommy
and
amalu
following
they
trod
the
body
of
holdorsen
underfoot
and
flew
and
forth
into
the
dusky
blaze
of
a
sunset
red
as
blood
the
numbers
were
still
equal
but
the
flying
scuds
dreamed
not
of
defence
and
fled
with
one
accord
for
the
forecastle
scuttle
brown
was
first
in
flight
he
disappeared
below
unscathed
the
chinaman
followed
with
a
ball
in
his
side
and
the
others
shinned
into
the
rigging
a
fierce
composure
settled
upon
wicks
and
carthew
their
fighting
second
wind
they
posted
tommy
at
the
fore
and
amalu
at
the
main
to
guard
the
masts
and
shrouds
and
going
themselves
into
the
waist
poured
out
a
box
of
cartridges
on
deck
and
filled
the
chambers
the
poor
devils
aloft
bleated
aloud
for
mercy
but
the
hour
of
any
mercy
was
gone
by
the
cup
was
brewed
and
must
be
drunken
to
the
dregs
since
so
many
had
fallen
all
must
fall
the
light
was
bad
the
cheap
revolvers
fouled
and
carried
wild
the
screaming
wretches
were
swift
to
flatten
themselves
against
the
masts
and
yards
or
find
a
momentary
refuge
in
the
hanging
sails
the
fell
business
took
long
but
it
was
done
at
last
hardy
the
londoner
was
shot
on
the
foreroyal
yard
and
hung
horribly
suspended
in
the
brails
wallen
the
other
had
his
jaw
broken
on
the
crosstrees
and
exposed
himself
shrieking
till
a
second
shot
dropped
him
on
the
deck
this
had
been
bad
enough
but
worse
remained
behind
there
was
still
brown
in
the
forepeak
tommy
with
a
sudden
clamour
of
weeping
begged
for
his
life
man
ca
hurt
us
he
sobbed
ca
go
on
with
this
i
spoke
to
him
at
dinner
he
an
awful
decent
little
cad
it
ca
be
done
nobody
can
go
into
that
place
and
murder
him
it
too
damned
the
sound
of
his
supplications
was
perhaps
audible
to
the
unfortunate
below
left
and
we
all
hang
said
wicks
must
go
the
same
the
big
man
was
deadly
white
and
trembled
like
an
aspen
and
he
had
no
sooner
finished
speaking
than
he
went
to
the
ship
side
and
vomited
can
never
do
it
if
we
wait
said
carthew
or
never
and
he
marched
towards
the
scuttle
no
no
wailed
tommy
clutching
at
his
jacket
but
carthew
flung
him
off
and
stepped
down
the
ladder
his
heart
rising
with
disgust
and
shame
the
chinaman
lay
on
the
floor
still
groaning
the
place
was
pitch
dark
cried
carthew
where
are
you
his
heart
smote
him
for
the
treacherous
apostrophe
but
no
answer
came
he
groped
in
the
bunks
they
were
all
empty
then
he
moved
towards
the
forepeak
which
was
hampered
with
coils
of
rope
and
spare
chandlery
in
general
he
said
again
sir
answered
a
shaking
voice
and
the
poor
invisible
caitiff
called
on
him
by
name
and
poured
forth
out
of
the
darkness
an
endless
garrulous
appeal
for
mercy
a
sense
of
danger
of
daring
had
alone
nerved
carthew
to
enter
the
forecastle
and
here
was
the
enemy
crying
and
pleading
like
a
frightened
child
his
obsequious
sir
his
horrid
fluency
of
obtestation
made
the
murder
tenfold
more
revolting
twice
carthew
raised
the
pistol
once
he
pressed
the
trigger
or
thought
he
did
with
all
his
might
but
no
explosion
followed
and
with
that
the
lees
of
his
courage
ran
quite
out
and
he
turned
and
fled
from
before
his
victim
wicks
sat
on
the
fore
hatch
raised
the
face
of
a
man
of
seventy
and
looked
a
wordless
question
carthew
shook
his
head
with
such
composure
as
a
man
displays
marching
towards
the
gallows
wicks
arose
walked
to
the
scuttle
and
went
down
brown
thought
it
was
carthew
returning
and
discovered
himself
half
crawling
from
his
shelter
with
another
incoherent
burst
of
pleading
wicks
emptied
his
revolver
at
the
voice
which
broke
into
whimperings
and
groans
silence
succeeded
and
the
murderer
ran
on
deck
like
one
possessed
the
other
three
were
now
all
gathered
on
the
fore
hatch
and
wicks
took
his
place
beside
them
without
question
asked
or
answered
they
sat
close
like
children
in
the
dark
and
shook
each
other
with
their
shaking
the
dusk
continued
to
fall
and
there
was
no
sound
but
the
beating
of
the
surf
and
the
occasional
hiccup
of
a
sob
from
tommy
hadden
if
there
was
another
ship
cried
carthew
of
a
sudden
wicks
started
and
looked
aloft
with
the
trick
of
all
seamen
and
shuddered
as
he
saw
the
hanging
figure
on
the
royal
yard
i
went
aloft
i
fall
he
said
simply
done
it
was
amalu
who
volunteered
climbed
to
the
very
truck
swept
the
fading
horizon
and
announced
nothing
within
sight
odds
said
wicks
ca
sleep
echoed
carthew
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
of
thundered
at
the
gallop
through
his
mind
then
we
ca
sit
and
chitter
here
said
wicks
cleaned
ship
and
i
ca
turn
to
till
i
had
gin
and
the
gin
in
the
cabin
and
who
to
fetch
it
will
said
carthew
any
one
has
amalu
passed
him
a
box
and
he
went
aft
and
down
the
companion
and
into
the
cabin
stumbling
upon
bodies
then
he
struck
a
match
and
his
looks
fell
upon
two
living
eyes
asked
mac
for
it
was
he
who
still
survived
in
that
shambles
of
a
cabin
done
they
all
dead
answered
carthew
said
the
irishman
and
fainted
the
gin
was
found
in
the
dead
captain
cabin
it
was
brought
on
deck
and
all
hands
had
a
dram
and
attacked
their
farther
task
the
night
was
come
the
moon
would
not
be
up
for
hours
a
lamp
was
set
on
the
main
hatch
to
light
amalu
as
he
washed
down
decks
and
the
galley
lantern
was
taken
to
guide
the
others
in
their
graveyard
business
holdorsen
hemstead
trent
and
goddedaal
were
first
disposed
of
the
last
still
breathing
as
he
went
over
the
side
wallen
followed
and
then
wicks
steadied
by
the
gin
went
aloft
with
a
boathook
and
succeeded
in
dislodging
hardy
the
chinaman
was
their
last
task
he
seemed
to
be
talked
aloud
in
his
unknown
language
as
they
brought
him
up
and
it
was
only
with
the
splash
of
his
sinking
body
that
the
gibberish
ceased
brown
by
common
consent
was
left
alone
flesh
and
blood
could
go
no
further
all
this
time
they
had
been
drinking
undiluted
gin
like
water
three
bottles
stood
broached
in
different
quarters
and
none
passed
without
a
gulp
tommy
collapsed
against
the
mainmast
wicks
fell
on
his
face
on
the
poop
ladder
and
moved
no
more
amalu
had
vanished
unobserved
carthew
was
the
last
afoot
he
stood
swaying
at
the
break
of
the
poop
and
the
lantern
which
he
still
carried
swung
with
his
movement
his
head
hummed
it
swarmed
with
broken
thoughts
memory
of
that
abominations
flared
up
and
died
down
within
him
like
the
light
of
a
lamp
in
a
strong
draught
and
then
he
had
a
drunkard
inspiration
must
be
no
more
of
this
he
thought
and
stumbled
once
more
below
the
absence
of
holdorsen
body
brought
him
to
a
stand
he
stood
and
stared
at
the
empty
floor
and
then
remembered
and
smiled
from
the
captain
room
he
took
the
open
case
with
one
dozen
and
three
bottles
of
gin
put
the
lantern
inside
and
walked
precariously
forth
mac
was
once
more
conscious
his
eyes
haggard
his
face
drawn
with
pain
and
flushed
with
fever
and
carthew
remembered
he
had
never
been
seen
to
had
lain
there
helpless
and
was
so
to
lie
all
night
injured
perhaps
dying
but
it
was
now
too
late
reason
had
now
fled
from
that
silent
ship
if
carthew
could
get
on
deck
again
it
was
as
much
as
he
could
hope
and
casting
on
the
unfortunate
a
glance
of
pity
the
tragic
drunkard
shouldered
his
way
up
the
companion
dropped
the
case
overboard
and
fell
in
the
scuppers
helpless
chapter
xxv
a
bad
bargain
with
the
first
colour
in
the
east
carthew
awoke
and
sat
up
a
while
he
gazed
at
the
scroll
of
the
morning
bank
and
the
spars
and
hanging
canvas
of
the
brig
like
a
man
who
wakes
in
a
strange
bed
with
a
simplicity
of
wonder
he
wondered
above
all
what
ailed
him
what
he
had
lost
what
disfavour
had
been
done
him
which
he
knew
he
should
resent
yet
had
forgotten
and
then
like
a
river
bursting
through
a
dam
the
truth
rolled
on
him
its
instantaneous
volume
his
memory
teemed
with
speech
and
pictures
that
he
should
never
again
forget
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
stood
a
moment
hand
to
brow
and
began
to
walk
violently
to
and
fro
by
the
companion
as
he
walked
he
wrung
his
hands
god
god
he
kept
saying
with
no
thought
of
prayer
uttering
a
mere
voice
of
agony
the
time
may
have
been
long
or
short
it
was
perhaps
minutes
perhaps
only
seconds
ere
he
awoke
to
find
himself
observed
and
saw
the
captain
sitting
up
and
watching
him
over
the
break
of
the
poop
a
strange
blindness
as
of
fever
in
his
eyes
a
haggard
knot
of
corrugations
on
his
brow
cain
saw
himself
in
a
mirror
for
a
flash
they
looked
upon
each
other
and
then
glanced
guiltily
aside
and
carthew
fled
from
the
eye
of
his
accomplice
and
stood
leaning
on
the
taffrail
an
hour
went
by
while
the
day
came
brighter
and
the
sun
rose
and
drank
up
the
clouds
an
hour
of
silence
in
the
ship
an
hour
of
agony
beyond
narration
for
the
sufferers
brown
gabbling
prayers
the
cries
of
the
sailors
in
the
rigging
strains
of
the
dead
hemstead
minstrelsy
ran
together
in
carthew
mind
with
sickening
iteration
he
neither
acquitted
nor
condemned
himself
he
did
not
think
he
suffered
in
the
bright
water
into
which
he
stared
the
pictures
changed
and
were
repeated
the
baresark
rage
of
goddedaal
the
light
of
the
sunset
into
which
they
had
run
forth
the
face
of
the
babbling
chinaman
as
they
cast
him
over
the
face
of
the
captain
seen
a
moment
since
as
he
awoke
from
drunkenness
into
remorse
and
time
passed
and
the
sun
swam
higher
and
his
torment
was
not
abated
then
were
fulfilled
many
sayings
and
the
weakest
of
these
condemned
brought
relief
and
healing
to
the
others
amalu
the
drudge
awoke
like
the
rest
to
sickness
of
body
and
distress
of
mind
but
the
habit
of
obedience
ruled
in
that
simple
spirit
and
appalled
to
be
so
late
he
went
direct
into
the
galley
kindled
the
fire
and
began
to
get
breakfast
at
the
rattle
of
dishes
the
snapping
of
the
fire
and
the
thin
smoke
that
went
up
straight
into
the
air
the
spell
was
lifted
the
condemned
felt
once
more
the
good
dry
land
of
habit
under
foot
they
touched
again
the
familiar
of
sanity
they
were
restored
to
a
sense
of
the
blessed
revolution
and
return
of
all
things
earthly
the
captain
drew
a
bucket
of
water
and
began
to
bathe
tommy
sat
up
watched
him
awhile
and
slowly
followed
his
example
and
carthew
remembering
his
last
thoughts
of
the
night
before
hastened
to
the
cabin
mac
was
awake
perhaps
had
not
slept
over
his
head
goddedaal
canary
twittered
shrilly
from
its
cage
are
you
asked
carthew
arrum
broke
returned
mac
i
can
stand
that
it
this
place
i
ca
abide
i
was
coming
on
deck
where
you
are
though
said
carthew
deadly
hot
above
and
there
no
wind
i
wash
out
this
and
he
paused
seeking
a
word
and
not
finding
one
for
the
grisly
foulness
of
the
cabin
i
be
obliged
to
ye
then
replied
the
irishman
he
spoke
mild
and
meek
like
a
sick
child
with
its
mother
there
was
now
no
violence
in
the
violent
man
and
as
carthew
fetched
a
bucket
and
swab
and
the
steward
sponge
and
began
to
cleanse
the
field
of
battle
he
alternately
watched
him
or
shut
his
eyes
and
sighed
like
a
man
near
fainting
have
to
ask
all
your
pardons
he
began
again
presently
the
more
shame
to
me
as
i
got
ye
into
trouble
and
could
do
nothing
when
it
came
ye
saved
me
life

carthew

know
what
it
was
it
was
nothing
down
here
they
fought
on
deck
o
my
god
and
carthew
with
the
bloody
sponge
pressed
to
his
face
struggled
a
moment
with
hysteria
cool
it
done
now
said
mac
ye
may
bless
god
ye
not
in
pain
and
helpless
in
the
there
was
no
more
said
by
one
or
other
and
the
cabin
was
pretty
well
cleansed
when
a
stroke
on
the
ship
bell
summoned
carthew
to
breakfast
tommy
had
been
busy
in
the
meanwhile
he
had
hauled
the
whaleboat
close
aboard
and
already
lowered
into
it
a
small
keg
of
beef
that
he
found
ready
broached
beside
the
galley
door
it
was
plain
he
had
but
the
one
idea
to
escape
have
a
shipful
of
stores
to
draw
upon
he
said
what
are
we
staying
for

at

the
captain
all
i
set
it
after
breakfast
i
thought
he
was
dead
like
the
rest
that
madman
hit
out
like
and
there
at
the
evocation
of
the
battle
his
voice
ceased
and
the
talk
died
with
it
after
breakfast
the
three
white
men
went
down
into
the
cabin
come
to
set
your
arm
said
the
captain
beg
your
pardon

captain
wicks
be
thinking
of

the
irishman

at
all
said
wicks
a
brig
under
foot
that
all
the
whaleboat
i
me
cried
tommy
childish
talk
you

what
use

anywhere

her
what
port

my

the
captain
brig
going

i
tell

where
too
and
that
about
forty
miles
to
windward
of
kauai
we
going
to
stay
by
her
till
she
down
and
once
the
masts
are
under
she
the
flying
scud
no
more
and
we
never
heard
of
such
a
brig
and
it
the
crew
of
the
schooner
currency
lass
that
comes
ashore
in
the
boat
and
takes
the
first
chance
to
dear
that
the
first
christian
word
i
heard
of
ut
cried
mac
now
just
let
me
arrum
be
jewel
and
get
the
brig
as
anxious
as
yourself
mac
returned
wicks
there
not
wind
enough
to
swear
by
so
let
see
your
arm
and
no
more
the
arm
was
set
and
splinted
the
body
of
brown
fetched
from
the
forepeak
where
it
lay
still
and
cold
and
committed
to
the
waters
of
the
lagoon
and
the
washing
of
the
cabin
rudely
finished
all
these
were
done
ere
midday
and
it
was
past
three
when
the
first
ruffled
the
lagoon
and
the
wind
came
in
a
dry
squall
which
presently
sobered
to
a
steady
breeze
the
interval
was
passed
by
all
in
feverish
impatience
and
by
one
of
the
party
in
secret
and
extreme
concern
of
mind
captain
wicks
was
a
sailor
he
could
take
a
schooner
through
a
scotch
reel
felt
her
mouth
and
divined
her
temper
like
a
rider
with
a
horse
she
on
her
side
recognising
her
master
and
following
his
wishes
like
a
dog
but
by
a
not
very
unusual
train
of
circumstance
the
man
dexterity
was
partial
and
circumscribed
on
a
schooner
deck
he
was
rembrandt
or
at
the
least
whistler
on
board
a
brig
he
was
pierre
grassou
again
and
again
in
the
course
of
the
morning
he
had
reasoned
out
his
policy
and
rehearsed
his
orders
and
ever
with
the
same
depression
and
weariness
it
was
it
was
chance
the
ship
might
behave
as
he
expected
and
might
not
suppose
she
failed
him
he
stood
there
helpless
beggared
of
all
the
proved
resources
of
experience
had
not
all
hands
been
so
weary
had
he
not
feared
to
communicate
his
own
misgivings
he
could
have
towed
her
out
but
these
reasons
sufficed
and
the
most
he
could
do
was
to
take
all
possible
precautions
accordingly
he
had
carthew
aft
explained
what
was
to
be
done
with
anxious
patience
and
visited
along
with
him
the
various
sheets
and
braces
hope
i
remember
said
carthew
seems
awfully
the
rottenest
kind
of
rig
the
captain
admitted
blooming
pocket
handkerchiefs
and
not
one
on
deck
ah
if
she
only
been
a
brigantine
now
but
it
lucky
the
passage
is
so
plain
no
manoeuvring
to
mention
we
get
under
way
before
the
wind
and
run
right
so
till
we
begin
to
get
foul
of
the
island
then
we
haul
our
wind
and
lie
as
near
as
may
be
till
we
on
that
line
ship
there
and
stand
straight
out
on
the
port
tack
catch
the
idea
i
see
the
idea
replied
carthew
rather
dismally
and
the
two
incompetents
studied
for
a
long
time
in
silence
the
complicated
gear
above
their
heads
but
the
time
came
when
these
rehearsals
must
be
put
in
practice
the
sails
were
lowered
and
all
hands
heaved
the
anchor
short
the
whaleboat
was
then
cut
adrift
the
upper
topsails
and
the
spanker
set
the
yards
braced
up
and
the
spanker
sheet
hauled
out
to
starboard
away
on
your
anchor
gone
it
was
done
and
the
brig
still
hung
enchanted
wicks
his
head
full
of
a
schooner
mainsail
turned
his
mind
to
the
spanker
first
he
hauled
in
the
sheet
and
then
he
hauled
it
out
with
no
result
the
damned
thing
up
he
bawled
at
last
with
a
red
face
ai
no
sense
in
it
was
the
last
stroke
of
bewilderment
for
the
poor
captain
that
he
had
no
sooner
brailed
up
the
spanker
than
the
vessel
came
before
the
wind
the
laws
of
nature
seemed
to
him
to
be
suspended
he
was
like
a
man
in
a
world
of
pantomime
tricks
the
cause
of
any
result
and
the
probable
result
of
any
action
equally
concealed
from
him
he
was
the
more
careful
not
to
shake
the
nerve
of
his
amateur
assistants
he
stood
there
with
a
face
like
a
torch
but
he
gave
his
orders
with
aplomb
and
indeed
now
the
ship
was
under
weigh
supposed
his
difficulties
over
the
lower
topsails
and
courses
were
then
set
and
the
brig
began
to
walk
the
water
like
a
thing
of
life
her
forefoot
discoursing
music
the
birds
flying
and
crying
over
her
spars
bit
by
bit
the
passage
began
to
open
and
the
blue
sea
to
show
between
the
flanking
breakers
on
the
reef
bit
by
bit
on
the
starboard
bow
the
low
land
of
the
islet
began
to
heave
closer
aboard
the
yards
were
braced
up
the
spanker
sheet
hauled
aft
again
the
brig
was
close
hauled
lay
down
to
her
work
like
a
thing
in
earnest
and
had
soon
drawn
near
to
the
point
of
advantage
where
she
might
stay
and
lie
out
of
the
lagoon
in
a
single
tack
wicks
took
the
wheel
himself
swelling
with
success
he
kept
the
brig
full
to
give
her
heels
and
began
to
bark
his
orders
about
helm
tacks
and
sheets
mainsail
and
then
the
fatal
words
do
your
mainsail
jump
forrard
and
haul
round
your
to
stay
a
ship
is
an
affair
of
knowledge
and
swift
sight
and
a
man
used
to
the
succinct
evolutions
of
a
schooner
will
always
tend
to
be
too
hasty
with
a
brig
it
was
so
now
the
order
came
too
soon
the
topsails
set
flat
aback
the
ship
was
in
irons
even
yet
had
the
helm
been
reversed
they
might
have
saved
her
but
to
think
of
a
at
all
far
more
to
think
of
profiting
by
one
were
foreign
to
the
mind
wicks
made
haste
instead
to
wear
ship
a
manoeuvre
for
which
room
was
wanting
and
the
flying
scud
took
ground
on
a
bank
of
sand
and
coral
about
twenty
minutes
before
five
wicks
was
no
hand
with
a
and
he
had
shown
it
but
he
was
a
sailor
and
a
born
captain
of
men
for
all
homely
purposes
where
intellect
is
not
required
and
an
eye
in
a
man
head
and
a
heart
under
his
jacket
will
suffice
before
the
others
had
time
to
understand
the
misfortune
he
was
bawling
fresh
orders
and
had
the
sails
clewed
up
and
took
soundings
round
the
ship
lies
lovely
he
remarked
and
ordered
out
a
boat
with
the
starboard
anchor
steady
cried
tommy
ai
going
to
turn
us
to
to
warp
her
off
am
though
replied
wicks
wo
set
a
hand
to
such
tomfoolery
for
one
replied
tommy
dead
he
went
and
sat
down
doggedly
on
the
main
hatch
got
us
on
get
us
off
again
he
added
carthew
and
wicks
turned
to
each
other
you
do
know
how
tired
we
are
said
carthew
tide
flowing
cried
the
captain
would
have
me
miss
a
rising
tide
gammon
there
tides
retorted
tommy
i
tell
you
what
added
carthew
breeze
is
failing
fast
and
the
sun
will
soon
be
down
we
may
get
into
all
kinds
of
fresh
mess
in
the
dark
and
with
nothing
but
light
do
deny
it
answered
wicks
and
stood
awhile
as
if
in
thought
what
i
ca
make
out
he
began
again
with
agitation
i
ca
make
out
is
what
you
made
of
to
stay
in
this
place
is
beyond
me
there
the
bloody
sun
going
down
and
to
stay
here
is
beyond
me
the
others
looked
upon
him
with
horrified
surprise
this
fall
of
their
chief
pillar
this
irrational
passion
in
the
practical
man
suddenly
barred
out
of
his
true
sphere
the
sphere
of
action
shocked
and
daunted
them
but
it
gave
to
another
and
unseen
hearer
the
chance
for
which
he
had
been
waiting
mac
on
the
striking
of
the
brig
had
crawled
up
the
companion
and
he
now
showed
himself
and
spoke
up
wicks
said
he
me
that
brought
this
trouble
on
the
lot
of
ye
i
sorry
for
ut
i
ask
all
your
pardons
and
if
there
any
one
can
say
forgive
ye
it
make
my
soul
the
wicks
stared
upon
the
man
in
amaze
then
his
returned
to
him
all
in
glass
houses
here
he
said
ai
going
to
turn
to
and
throw
stones
i
forgive
you
sure
enough
and
much
good
may
it
do
you
the
others
spoke
to
the
same
purpose
thank
ye
for
ut
and
is
done
like
gentlemen
said
mac
there
another
thing
i
have
upon
my
mind
i
hope
we
all
here
it
appeared
they
were
it
seemed
a
small
thing
for
the
protestant
religion
to
rejoice
in
that
as
it
should
be
continued
mac
why
should
we
say
the
lord
prayer
there
ca
be
no
hurt
in
he
had
the
same
quiet
pleading
childlike
way
with
him
as
in
the
morning
and
the
others
accepted
his
proposal
and
knelt
down
without
a
word
if
ye
like
said
he
and
he
covered
his
eyes
so
the
prayer
was
said
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
surf
and
seabirds
and
all
rose
refreshed
and
felt
lightened
of
a
load
up
to
then
they
had
cherished
their
guilty
memories
in
private
or
only
referred
to
them
in
the
heat
of
a
moment
and
fallen
immediately
silent
now
they
had
faced
their
remorse
in
company
and
the
worst
seemed
over
nor
was
it
only
that
but
the
petition
us
our
trespasses
falling
in
so
apposite
after
they
had
themselves
forgiven
the
immediate
author
of
their
miseries
sounded
like
an
absolution
tea
was
taken
on
deck
in
the
time
of
the
sunset
and
not
long
after
the
five
castaways
castaways
once
more
lay
down
to
sleep
day
dawned
windless
and
hot
their
slumbers
had
been
too
profound
to
be
refreshing
and
they
woke
listless
and
sat
up
and
stared
about
them
with
dull
eyes
only
wicks
smelling
a
hard
day
work
ahead
was
more
alert
he
went
first
to
the
well
sounded
it
once
and
then
a
second
time
and
stood
awhile
with
a
grim
look
so
that
all
could
see
he
was
dissatisfied
then
he
shook
himself
stripped
to
the
buff
clambered
on
the
rail
drew
himself
up
and
raised
his
arms
to
plunge
the
dive
was
never
taken
he
stood
instead
transfixed
his
eyes
on
the
horizon
up
that
glass
he
said
in
a
trice
they
were
all
swarming
aloft
the
nude
captain
leading
with
the
glass
on
the
northern
horizon
was
a
finger
of
grey
smoke
straight
in
the
windless
air
like
a
point
of
admiration
do
you
make
it
they
asked
of
wicks
truck
down
he
replied
telling
yet
by
the
way
the
smoke
builds
she
must
be
heading
right
can
she
be
might
be
a
china
mail
returned
wicks
she
might
be
a
blooming
come
to
look
for
castaways
here
this
ai
the
time
to
stand
staring
on
deck
boys
he
was
the
first
on
deck
as
he
had
been
the
first
aloft
handed
down
the
ensign
bent
it
again
to
the
signal
halliards
and
ran
it
up
union
down
hear

he
said
jumping
into
his
trousers
everything
i
say
you
grip
on
to
if
that
a
she
be
in
a
tearing
hurry
all
these
ships
are
what
do

nothing
and
have
their
expenses
paid
that
our
chance
for
we
go
with
them
and
they
wo
take
the
time
to
look
twice
or
to
ask
a
question
i

that
pale
company
recited
their
lesson
earnestly
were
the
names
of
the
other
two
he
asked
carthew
shot
in
the
companion
and
the
one
i
caught
in
the
jaw
on
the
main
and
wallen
said
some
one
they
drowned
continued
wicks
alongside
trying
to
lower
a
boat
we
had
a
bit
of
a
squall
last
night
that
how
we
got
he
ran
and
squinted

jammed
and
holdorsen
and
wallen
spilt
overboard
see
clear
your
blooming
heads
he
was
in
his
jacket
now
and
spoke
with
a
feverish
impatience
and
contention
that
rang
like
anger
is
it
safe
asked
tommy
bellowed
the
captain
standing
on
the
drop
you
if
that
ship
bound
for
china
which
she
do
look
to
be
we
lost
as
soon
as
we
arrive

the
other
way
she
comes
from
china

she
well
if

on
board
of
her

that
what

this
convincing
picture
fear
took
hold
on
all
we
a
hundred
times

by
the

cried
carthew
would
give
us
a
hand
to
float
her
make
me
waste
this
holy
day
in
chattering
cried
wicks
here
when
i
sounded
the
well
this
morning
there
was
two
foot
of
water
there
against
eight
inches
last
night
what
wrong
i
do
know
might
be
nothing
might
be
the
worst
kind
of
smash
and
then
there
we
are
in
for
a
thousand
miles
in
an
open
boat
if
that
your
taste
it
may
be
nothing
and
anyway
their
carpenters
are
bound
to
help
us
repair
her
argued
carthew
murphy
cried
the
captain
did
she
strike
bows
on
i
believe
and
she
down
by
the
head
now
if
any
carpenter
comes
tinkering
here
where
he
go
first
down
in
the
forepeak
i
suppose
and
then
how
about
all
that
blood
among
the
chandlery
you
would
think
you
were
a
lot
of
members
of
parliament
discussing
plimsoll
and
just
a
pack
of
murderers
with
the
halter
round
your
neck
any
other
ass

any
time
to
waste
no
thank
god
for
that

going
below
and
i
leave
you
here
on

to
and
open
the
specie

five
of
us
get
five
chests
and
divide
the
specie
equal
among
the
five
put
it
at
the
bottom
and
go
at
it
like
tigers

blankets
or
canvas
or
clothes
so

wo
rattle

five
pretty
heavy
chests
but
we
ca
help

you
carthew

you
goddedaal

below
we
our
share
before
and
he
cast
another
glance
at
the
smoke
and
hurried
below
with
carthew
at
his
heels
the
logs
were
found
in
the
main
cabin
behind
the
canary
cage
two
of
them
one
kept
by
trent
one
by
goddedaal
wicks
looked
first
at
one
then
at
the
other
and
his
lip
stuck
out

of

he
asked

carthew

cried
the
captain

yourself

hands
of
the
schooner

added
turning
to
the
other
log

clear
fortnight

of
your
log
altogether
goddedaal

here
and

in
the
way
i
tell

loss

asked
carthew
never
kept
one
replied
the
captain
neglect
of
duty
you
catch
the
change
of
writing
resumed
carthew
began
why
do
you
stop
and
why
do
i
come
in
and
you
have
to
sign
i
met
with
an
accident
and
ca
write
replied
wicks
accident
repeated
carthew
do
sound
natural
what
kind
of
an
accident
wicks
spread
his
hand
on
the
table
and
drove
a
knife
through
his
palm
kind
of
an
accident
said
he
a
way
to
draw
to
windward
of
most
difficulties
if
you
a
head
on
your
he
began
to
bind
up
his
hand
with
a
handkerchief
glancing
the
while
over
goddedaal
log
he
said
never
do
for
us
this
is
an
impossible
kind
of
a
yarn
here
to
begin
with
is
this
captain
trent
trying
some
fancy
course
leastways
he
a
thousand
miles
to
of
the
great
circle
and
here
it
seems
he
was
close
up
with
this
island
on
the
sixth
sails
all
these
days
and
is
close
up
with
it
again
by
daylight
on
the
said
they
had
the
deuce
luck
said
carthew
it
do
look
like
real
life
that
all
i
can
say
returned
wicks
the
way
it
was
though
argued
carthew
it
is
and
what
the
better
are
we
for
that
if
it
do
look
so
cried
the
captain
sounding
unwonted
depths
of
art
criticism
try
and
see
if
you
ca
tie
this
bandage
i
bleeding
like
a
as
carthew
sought
to
adjust
the
handkerchief
his
patient
seemed
sunk
in
a
deep
muse
his
eye
veiled
his
mouth
partly
open
the
job
was
yet
scarce
done
when
he
sprang
to
his
feet
have
it
he
broke
out
and
ran
on
deck
boys
he
cried
did
come
here
on
the
eleventh
we
came
in
here
on
the
evening
of
the
sixth
and
lay
here
ever
since
becalmed
as
soon
as
you
done
with
these
chests
he
added
can
turn
to
and
roll
out
beef
and
water
breakers
it
look
more
shipshape
like
as
if
we
were
getting
ready
for
the
boat
and
he
was
back
again
in
a
moment
cooking
the
new
log
goddedaal
was
then
carefully
destroyed
and
a
hunt
began
for
the
ship
papers
of
all
the
agonies
of
that
breathless
morning
this
was
perhaps
the
most
poignant
here
and
there
the
two
men
searched
cursing
cannoning
together
streaming
with
heat
freezing
with
terror
news
was
bawled
down
to
them
that
the
ship
was
indeed
a
that
she
was
close
up
that
she
was
lowering
a
boat
and
still
they
sought
in
vain
by
what
accident
they
missed
the
iron
box
with
the
money
and
accounts
is
hard
to
fancy
but
they
did
and
the
vital
documents
were
found
at
last
in
the
pocket
of
trent
coat
where
he
had
left
them
when
last
he
came
on
board
wicks
smiled
for
the
first
time
that
morning
too
soon
said
he
now
for
it
take
these
others
for
me
i
afraid
i
get
them
mixed
if
i
keep
are
they
carthew
asked
the
kirkup
and
currency
lass
papers
he
replied
god
we
need
again
inside
the
lagoon
sir
hailed
down
mac
who
sat
by
the
skylight
doing
sentry
while
the
others
worked
we
were
on
deck
then
goddedaal
said
wicks
as
they
turned
to
leave
the
cabin
the
canary
burst
into
piercing
song
god
cried
carthew
with
a
gulp
ca
leave
that
wretched
bird
to
starve
it
was
poor
the
bally
thing
along
cried
the
captain
and
they
went
on
deck
an
ugly
brute
of
a
modern
lay
just
without
the
reef
now
quite
inert
now
giving
a
flap
or
two
with
her
propeller
nearer
hand
and
just
within
a
big
white
boat
came
skimming
to
the
stroke
of
many
oars
her
ensign
blowing
at
the
stern
word
more
said
wicks
after
he
had
taken
in
the
scene
you
been
in
china
ports
all
right
then
you
can
speak
for
yourself
the
rest
of
you
i
kept
on
board
all
the
time
we
were
in
hongkong
hoping
you
would
desert
but
you
fooled
me
and
stuck
to
the
brig
that
make
your
lying
come
the
boat
was
now
close
at
hand
a
boy
in
the
stern
sheets
was
the
only
officer
and
a
poor
one
plainly
for
the
men
were
talking
as
they
pulled
god
they
only
sent
a
kind
of
a
middy
ejaculated
wicks
you
hardy
stand
i
have
no
deck
hands
on
my
he
cried
and
the
reproof
braced
the
whole
crew
like
a
cold
douche
the
boat
came
alongside
with
perfect
neatness
and
the
boy
officer
stepped
on
board
where
he
was
respectfully
greeted
by
wicks
the
master
of
this
ship
he
asked
sir
said
wicks
is
my
name
and
this
is
the
flying
scud
of
seem
to
have
got
into
a
mess
said
the
officer
you
step
aft
with
me
here
i
tell
you
all
there
is
of
it
said
wicks
man
you
shaking
cried
the
officer
would
you
perhaps
if
you
had
been
in
the
same
berth
returned
wicks
and
he
told
the
whole
story
of
the
rotten
water
the
long
calm
the
squall
the
seamen
drowned
glibly
and
hotly
talking
with
his
head
in
the
lion
mouth
like
one
pleading
in
the
dock
i
heard
the
same
tale
from
the
same
narrator
in
the
saloon
in
san
francisco
and
even
then
his
bearing
filled
me
with
suspicion
but
the
officer
was
no
observer
the
captain
is
in
no
end
of
a
hurry
said
he
i
was
instructed
to
give
you
all
the
assistance
in
my
power
and
signal
back
for
another
boat
if
more
hands
were
necessary
what
can
i
do
for
you
we
wo
keep
you
no
time
replied
wicks
cheerily
all
ready
bless
you
men
chests
chronometer
papers
and
you
mean
to
leave
her
cried
the
officer
seems
to
me
to
lie
nicely
ca
we
get
your
ship
off
we
could
and
no
mistake
but
how
we
to
keep
her
afloat
another
question
her
bows
is
stove
in
replied
wicks
the
officer
coloured
to
the
eyes
he
was
incompetent
and
knew
he
was
thought
he
was
already
detected
and
feared
to
expose
himself
again
there
was
nothing
further
from
his
mind
than
that
the
captain
should
deceive
him
if
the
captain
was
pleased
why
so
was
he
right
he
said
your
men
to
get
their
chests
goddedaal
turn
the
hands
to
to
get
the
chests
aboard
said
wicks
the
four
currency
lasses
had
waited
the
while
on
this
welcome
news
broke
upon
them
like
the
sun
at
midnight
and
hadden
burst
into
a
storm
of
tears
sobbing
aloud
as
he
heaved
upon
the
tackle
but
the
work
went
none
the
less
briskly
forward
chests
men
and
bundles
were
got
over
the
side
with
alacrity
the
boat
was
shoved
off
it
moved
out
of
the
long
shadow
of
the
flying
scud
and
its
bows
were
pointed
at
the
passage
so
much
then
was
accomplished
the
sham
wreck
had
passed
muster
they
were
clear
of
her
they
were
safe
away
and
the
water
widened
between
them
and
her
damning
evidences
on
the
other
hand
they
were
drawing
nearer
to
the
ship
of
war
which
might
very
well
prove
to
be
their
prison
and
a
hangman
cart
to
bear
them
to
the
gallows
of
which
they
had
not
yet
learned
either
whence
she
came
or
whither
she
was
bound
and
the
doubt
weighed
upon
their
heart
like
mountains
it
was
wicks
who
did
the
talking
the
sound
was
small
in
carthew
ears
like
the
voices
of
men
miles
away
but
the
meaning
of
each
word
struck
home
to
him
like
a
bullet
did
you
say
your
ship
was
inquired
wicks
do
you
know
returned
the
officer
do
you
know
what
could
that
mean
perhaps
nothing
perhaps
that
the
ships
had
met
already
wicks
took
his
courage
in
both
hands
is
she
bound
he
asked
we
just
looking
in
at
all
these
miserable
islands
here
said
the
officer
we
bear
up
for
san
yes
you
from
china
ways
like
us
pursued
wicks
kong
said
the
officer
and
spat
over
the
side
hong
kong
then
the
game
was
up
as
soon
as
they
set
foot
on
board
they
would
be
seized
the
wreck
would
be
examined
the
blood
found
the
lagoon
perhaps
dredged
and
the
bodies
of
the
dead
would
reappear
to
testify
an
impulse
almost
incontrollable
bade
carthew
rise
from
the
thwart
shriek
out
aloud
and
leap
overboard
it
seemed
so
vain
a
thing
to
dissemble
longer
to
dally
with
the
inevitable
to
spin
out
some
hundred
seconds
more
of
agonised
suspense
with
shame
and
death
thus
visibly
approaching
but
the
indomitable
wicks
persevered
his
face
was
like
a
skull
his
voice
scarce
recognisable
the
dullest
of
men
and
officers
it
seemed
must
have
remarked
that
telltale
countenance
and
broken
utterance
and
still
he
persevered
bent
upon
certitude
place
hong
kong
he
said
sure
i
do
know
said
the
officer
a
day
and
a
half
there
called
for
orders
and
came
straight
on
here
never
heard
of
such
a
beastly
and
he
went
on
describing
and
lamenting
the
untoward
fortunes
of
the
tempest
but
wicks
and
carthew
heeded
him
no
longer
they
lay
back
on
the
gunnel
breathing
deep
sunk
in
a
stupor
of
the
body
the
mind
within
still
nimbly
and
agreeably
at
work
measuring
the
past
danger
exulting
in
the
present
relief
numbering
with
ecstasy
their
ultimate
chances
of
escape
for
the
voyage
in
the
they
were
now
safe
yet
a
few
more
days
of
peril
activity
and
presence
of
mind
in
san
francisco
and
the
whole
horrid
tale
was
blotted
out
and
wicks
again
became
kirkup
and
goddedaal
became
carthew
men
beyond
all
shot
of
possible
suspicion
men
who
had
never
heard
of
the
flying
scud
who
had
never
been
in
sight
of
midway
reef
so
they
came
alongside
under
many
craning
heads
of
seamen
and
projecting
mouths
of
guns
so
they
climbed
on
board
somnambulous
and
looked
blindly
about
them
at
the
tall
spars
the
white
decks
and
the
crowding
ship
company
and
heard
men
as
from
far
away
and
answered
them
at
random
and
then
a
hand
fell
softly
on
carthew
shoulder
norrie
old
chappie
where
have
you
dropped
from
all
the
been
looking
for
you
do
you
know
you
come
into
your
kingdom
he
turned
beheld
the
face
of
his
old
schoolmate
sebright
and
fell
unconscious
at
his
feet
the
doctor
was
attending
him
a
while
later
in
lieutenant
cabin
when
he
came
to
himself
he
opened
his
eyes
looked
hard
in
the
strange
face
and
spoke
with
a
kind
of
solemn
vigour
must
go
the
same
road
he
said
or
and
then
paused
and
his
reason
coming
to
him
with
more
clearness
spoke
again
was
i
saying
where
am
i
who
are
you
am
the
doctor
of
the
tempest
was
the
reply
are
in
lieutenant
sebright
berth
and
you
may
dismiss
all
concern
from
your
mind
your
troubles
are
over
do
you
call
me
that
he
asked
i
remember
sebright
knew
me
o
and
he
groaned
and
shook
down
wicks
to
me
i
must
see
wicks
at
once
he
cried
and
seized
the
doctor
wrist
with
unconscious
violence
right
said
the
doctor
make
a
bargain
you
swallow
down
this
draught
and
i
go
and
fetch
and
he
gave
the
wretched
man
an
opiate
that
laid
him
out
within
ten
minutes
and
in
all
likelihood
preserved
his
reason
it
was
the
doctor
next
business
to
attend
to
mac
and
he
found
occasion
while
engaged
upon
his
arm
to
make
the
man
repeat
the
names
of
the
rescued
crew
it
was
now
the
turn
of
the
captain
and
there
is
no
doubt
he
was
no
longer
the
man
that
we
have
seen
sudden
relief
the
sense
of
perfect
safety
a
square
meal
and
a
good
glass
of
grog
had
all
combined
to
relax
his
vigilance
and
depress
his
energy
was
this
done
asked
the
doctor
looking
at
the
wound
than
a
week
ago
replied
wicks
thinking
singly
of
his
log
cried
the
doctor
and
he
raised
his
hand
and
looked
the
captain
in
the
eyes
do
remember
exactly
faltered
wicks
and
at
this
remarkable
falsehood
the
suspicions
of
the
doctor
were
at
once
quadrupled
the
way
which
of
you
is
called
wicks
he
asked
easily
that
snapped
the
captain
falling
white
as
paper
repeated
the
doctor
of
you
is
he
that
surely
a
plain
wicks
stared
upon
his
questioner
in
silence
is
brown
then
pursued
the
doctor
are
you
talking
of
what
do
you
mean
by
this
cried
wicks
snatching
his
hand
away
so
that
the
blood
sprinkled
in
the
surgeon
face
he
did
not
trouble
to
remove
it
looking
straight
at
his
victim
he
pursued
his
questions
must
brown
go
the
same
way
he
asked
wicks
fell
trembling
on
a
locker
told
you
he
cried
replied
the
doctor
has
not
but
he
and
you
between
you
have
set
me
thinking
and
i
think
there
something
me
some
grog
said
wicks
rather
tell
than
have
you
find
out
i
damned
if
it
half
as
bad
as
what
any
one
would
and
with
the
help
of
a
couple
of
strong
grogs
the
tragedy
of
the
flying
scud
was
told
for
the
first
time
it
was
a
fortunate
series
of
accidents
that
brought
the
story
to
the
doctor
he
understood
and
pitied
the
position
of
these
wretched
men
and
came
to
their
assistance
he
and
wicks
and
carthew
so
soon
as
he
was
recovered
held
a
hundred
councils
and
prepared
a
policy
for
san
francisco
it
was
he
who
certified
unfit
to
be
moved
and
smuggled
carthew
ashore
under
cloud
of
night
it
was
he
who
kept
wicks
wound
open
that
he
might
sign
with
his
left
hand
he
who
took
all
their
chile
silver
and
in
the
course
of
the
first
day
got
it
converted
for
them
into
portable
gold
he
used
his
influence
in
the
wardroom
to
keep
the
tongues
of
the
young
officers
in
order
so
that
carthew
identification
was
kept
out
of
the
papers
and
he
rendered
another
service
yet
more
important
he
had
a
friend
in
san
francisco
a
millionaire
to
this
man
he
privately
presented
carthew
as
a
young
gentleman
come
newly
into
a
huge
estate
but
troubled
with
jew
debts
which
he
was
trying
to
settle
on
the
quiet
the
millionaire
came
readily
to
help
and
it
was
with
his
money
that
the
wrecker
gang
was
to
be
fought
what
was
his
name
out
of
a
thousand
guesses
it
was
douglas
longhurst
as
long
as
the
currency
lasses
could
all
disappear
under
fresh
names
it
did
not
greatly
matter
if
the
brig
were
bought
or
any
small
discrepancies
should
be
discovered
in
the
wrecking
the
identification
of
one
of
their
number
had
changed
all
that
the
smallest
scandal
must
now
direct
attention
to
the
movements
of
norris
it
would
be
asked
how
he
who
had
sailed
in
a
schooner
from
sydney
had
turned
up
so
shortly
after
in
a
brig
out
of
hong
kong
and
from
one
question
to
another
all
his
original
shipmates
were
pretty
sure
to
be
involved
hence
arose
naturally
the
idea
of
preventing
danger
profiting
by
wealth
and
buying
the
brig
under
an
alias
and
it
was
put
in
hand
with
equal
energy
and
caution
carthew
took
lodgings
alone
under
a
false
name
picked
up
bellairs
at
random
and
commissioned
him
to
buy
the
wreck
figure
if
you
please
the
lawyer
asked
want
it
bought
replied
carthew
do
mind
about
the
price
is
no
price
said
bellairs
a
name
upon
it
ten
thousand
pounds
then
if
you
like
said
carthew
in
the
meanwhile
the
captain
had
to
walk
the
streets
appear
in
the
consulate
be
by
lloyd
agent
be
badgered
about
his
lost
accounts
sign
papers
with
his
left
hand
and
repeat
his
lies
to
every
skipper
in
san
francisco
not
knowing
at
what
moment
he
might
run
into
the
arms
of
some
old
friend
who
should
hail
him
by
the
name
of
wicks
or
some
new
enemy
who
should
be
in
a
position
to
deny
him
that
of
trent
and
the
latter
incident
did
actually
befall
him
but
was
transformed
by
his
stout
countenance
into
an
element
of
strength
it
was
in
the
consulate
of
all
untoward
places
that
he
suddenly
heard
a
big
voice
inquiring
for
captain
trent
he
turned
with
the
customary
sinking
at
his
heart
ai
captain
trent
said
the
stranger
falling
back
all
this
they
tell
me
you
passing
off
as
captain
trent
captain
jacob
trent
a
man
i
knew
since
i
was
that
you
thinking
of
my
uncle
as
had
the
bank
in
cardiff
replied
wicks
with
desperate
aplomb
declare
i
never
knew
he
had
a
nevvy
said
the
stranger
you
see
he
has
says
wicks
how
is
the
old
man
asked
the
other
as
a
fiddle
answered
wicks
and
was
opportunely
summoned
by
the
clerk
this
alert
was
the
only
one
until
the
morning
of
the
sale
when
he
was
once
more
alarmed
by
his
interview
with
jim
and
it
was
with
some
anxiety
that
he
attended
the
sale
knowing
only
that
carthew
was
to
be
represented
but
neither
who
was
to
represent
him
nor
what
were
the
instructions
given
i
suppose
captain
wicks
is
a
good
life
in
spite
of
his
personal
appearance
and
his
own
known
uneasiness
i
suppose
he
is
secure
from
apoplexy
or
it
must
have
struck
him
there
and
then
as
he
looked
on
at
the
stages
of
that
insane
sale
and
saw
the
old
brig
and
her
not
very
valuable
cargo
knocked
down
at
last
to
a
total
stranger
for
ten
thousand
pounds
it
had
been
agreed
that
he
was
to
avoid
carthew
and
above
all
lodging
so
that
no
connexion
might
be
traced
between
the
crew
and
the
pseudonymous
purchaser
but
the
hour
for
caution
was
gone
by
and
he
caught
a
tram
and
made
all
speed
to
mission
street
carthew
met
him
in
the
door
away
come
away
from
here
said
carthew
and
when
they
were
clear
of
the
house
up
he
added
you
heard
of
the
sale
then
said
wicks
sale
cried
carthew
declare
i
had
forgotten
and
he
told
of
the
voice
in
the
telephone
and
the
maddening
question
did
you
want
to
buy
the
flying
scud
this
circumstance
coming
on
the
back
of
the
monstrous
improbabilities
of
the
sale
was
enough
to
have
shaken
the
reason
of
immanuel
kant
the
earth
seemed
banded
together
to
defeat
them
the
stones
and
the
boys
on
the
street
appeared
to
be
in
possession
of
their
guilty
secret
flight
was
their
one
thought
the
treasure
of
the
currency
lass
they
packed
in
expressed
their
chests
to
an
imaginary
address
in
british
columbia
and
left
san
francisco
the
same
afternoon
booked
for
los
angeles
the
next
day
they
pursued
their
retreat
by
the
southern
pacific
route
which
carthew
followed
on
his
way
to
england
but
the
other
three
branched
off
for
mexico
epilogue
to
will
low
dear
low
the
other
day
at
manihiki
of
all
places
i
had
the
pleasure
to
meet
dodd
we
sat
some
two
hours
in
the
neat
little
church
set
with
pews
after
the
manner
of
europe
and
inlaid
with
in
the
style
i
suppose
of
the
new
jerusalem
the
natives
who
are
decidedly
the
most
attractive
inhabitants
of
this
planet
crowded
round
us
in
the
pew
and
fawned
upon
and
patted
us
and
here
it
was
i
put
my
questions
and
dodd
answered
me
i
first
carried
him
back
to
the
night
in
barbizon
when
carthew
told
his
story
and
asked
him
what
was
done
about
bellairs
it
seemed
he
had
put
the
matter
to
his
friend
at
once
and
that
carthew
took
it
with
an
inimitable
lightness
poor
and
i
rich
he
had
said
can
afford
to
smile
at
him
i
go
somewhere
else
that
all
somewhere
that
far
away
and
dear
to
get
to
persia
would
be
found
to
answer
i
fancy
no
end
of
a
place
persia
why
not
come
with
me
and
they
had
left
the
next
afternoon
for
constantinople
on
their
way
to
teheran
of
the
shyster
it
is
only
known
by
a
newspaper
paragraph
that
he
returned
somehow
to
san
francisco
and
died
in
the
hospital
there
another
point
said
i
you
are
off
to
persia
with
a
millionaire
and
rich
yourself
how
come
you
here
in
the
south
seas
running
a
trader
he
said
with
a
smile
that
i
had
not
yet
heard
of
jim
last
bankruptcy
was
about
cleaned
out
once
more
he
said
then
it
was
that
carthew
had
this
schooner
built
and
put
me
in
as
supercargo
it
his
yacht
and
it
my
trader
and
as
nearly
all
the
expenses
go
to
the
yacht
i
do
pretty
well
as
for
jim
he
right
again
one
of
the
best
businesses
they
say
in
the
west
fruit
cereals
and
real
estate
and
he
has
a
tartar
of
a
partner
now
nares
no
less
nares
will
keep
him
straight
nares
has
a
big
head
they
have
their
next
door
at
saucelito
and
i
stayed
with
them
time
about
the
last
time
i
was
on
the
coast
jim
had
a
paper
of
his
own
i
think
he
has
a
notion
of
being
senator
one
of
these
days
and
he
wanted
me
to
throw
up
the
schooner
and
come
and
write
his
editorials
he
holds
strong
views
on
the
state
constitution
and
so
does
what
became
of
the
other
three
currency
lasses
after
they
left
carthew
i
inquired
it
seems
they
had
a
huge
spree
in
the
city
of
mexico
said
dodd
then
hadden
and
the
irishman
took
a
turn
at
the
gold
fields
in
venezuela
and
wicks
went
on
alone
to
valparaiso
there
a
kirkup
in
the
chilean
navy
to
this
day
i
saw
the
name
in
the
papers
about
the
balmaceda
war
hadden
soon
wearied
of
the
mines
and
i
met
him
the
other
day
in
sydney
the
last
news
he
had
from
venezuela
mac
had
been
knocked
over
in
an
attack
on
the
gold
train
so
there
only
the
three
of
them
left
for
amalu
scarcely
counts
he
lives
on
his
own
land
in
maui
at
the
side
of
where
he
keeps
goddedaal
canary
and
they
say
he
sticks
to
his
dollars
which
is
a
wonder
in
a
kanaka
he
had
a
considerable
pile
to
start
with
for
not
only
hemstead
share
but
carthew
was
divided
equally
among
the
other
four
mac
being
did
that
make
for
him
altogether
i
could
not
help
asking
for
i
had
been
diverted
by
the
number
of
calculations
in
his
narrative
hundred
and
pounds
nineteen
shillings
and
eleven
pence
halfpenny
he
replied
with
composure
leaving
out
what
little
he
won
at
van
john
it
something
for
a
kanaka
you
and
about
that
time
we
were
at
last
obliged
to
yield
to
the
solicitations
of
our
native
admirers
and
go
to
the
pastor
house
to
drink
green
cocoanuts
the
ship
i
was
in
was
sailing
the
same
night
for
dodd
had
been
beforehand
and
got
all
the
shell
in
the
island
and
though
he
pressed
me
to
desert
and
return
with
him
to
auckland
whither
he
was
now
bound
to
pick
up
carthew
i
was
firm
in
my
refusal
the
truth
is
since
i
have
been
mixed
up
with
havens
and
dodd
in
the
design
to
publish
the
latter
narrative
i
seem
to
feel
no
want
for
carthew
society
of
course
i
am
wholly
modern
in
sentiment
and
think
nothing
more
noble
than
to
publish
people
private
affairs
at
so
much
a
line
they
like
it
and
if
they
do
they
ought
to
but
a
still
small
voice
keeps
telling
me
they
will
not
like
it
always
and
perhaps
not
always
stand
it
memory
besides
supplies
me
with
the
face
of
a
pressman
in
the
sacred
phrase
who
proved
altogether
too
modern
for
one
of
his
neighbours
and
qui
nunc
it
per
iter
tenebricosum
as
it
were
marshalling
us
our
way
i
am
in
no
haste
to
nos
proecedens
be
that
man
successor
carthew
has
a
record
as
clane
shot
and
for
some
years
samoa
will
be
good
enough
for
me
we
agreed
to
separate
accordingly
but
he
took
me
on
board
in
his
own
boat
with
the
fittings
and
entertained
me
on
the
way
with
an
account
of
his
late
visit
to
butaritari
whither
he
had
gone
on
an
errand
for
carthew
to
see
how
topelius
was
getting
along
and
if
necessary
to
give
him
a
helping
hand
but
topelius
was
in
great
force
and
had
patronised
and
well
him
will
be
pleased
said
dodd
there
no
doubt
they
oppressed
the
man
abominably
when
they
were
in
the
currency
lass
diamond
cut
diamond
this
i
think
was
the
most
of
the
news
i
got
from
my
friend
loudon
and
i
hope
i
was
well
inspired
and
have
put
all
the
questions
to
which
you
would
be
curious
to
hear
an
answer
but
there
is
one
more
that
i
daresay
you
are
burning
to
put
to
myself
and
that
is
what
your
own
name
is
doing
in
this
place
cropping
up
as
it
were
on
the
stern
of
our
poor
ship
if
you
were
not
born
in
arcadia
you
linger
in
fancy
on
its
margin
your
thoughts
are
busied
with
the
flutes
of
antiquity
with
daffodils
and
the
classic
poplar
and
the
footsteps
of
the
nymphs
and
the
elegant
and
moving
aridity
of
ancient
art
why
dedicate
to
you
a
tale
of
a
caste
so
modern
full
of
details
of
our
barbaric
manners
and
unstable
morals
full
of
the
need
and
the
lust
of
money
so
that
there
is
scarce
a
page
in
which
the
dollars
do
not
jingle
full
of
the
unrest
and
movement
of
our
century
so
that
the
reader
is
hurried
from
place
to
place
and
sea
to
sea
and
the
book
is
less
a
romance
than
a
panorama
in
the
end
as
as
an
epic
well
you
are
a
man
interested
in
all
problems
of
art
even
the
most
vulgar
and
it
may
amuse
you
to
hear
the
genesis
and
growth
of
on
board
the
schooner
equator
almost
within
sight
of
the
johnstone
islands
if
anybody
knows
where
these
are
and
on
a
moonlit
night
when
it
was
a
joy
to
be
alive
the
authors
were
amused
with
several
stories
of
the
sale
of
wrecks
the
subject
tempted
them
and
they
sat
apart
in
the
to
discuss
its
possibilities
a
tangle
it
would
make
suggested
one
the
wrong
crew
were
aboard
but
how
to
get
the
wrong
crew
there
have
it
cried
the
other
affair
for
not
so
many
months
before
and
not
so
many
hundred
miles
from
where
we
were
then
sailing
a
proposition
almost
tantamount
to
that
of
captain
trent
had
been
made
by
a
british
skipper
to
some
british
castaways
before
we
turned
in
the
scaffolding
of
the
tale
had
been
put
together
but
the
question
of
treatment
was
as
usual
more
obscure
we
had
long
been
at
once
attracted
and
repelled
by
that
very
modern
form
of
the
police
novel
or
mystery
story
which
consists
in
beginning
your
yarn
anywhere
but
at
the
beginning
and
finishing
it
anywhere
but
at
the
end
attracted
by
its
peculiar
interest
when
done
and
the
peculiar
difficulties
that
attend
its
execution
repelled
by
that
appearance
of
insincerity
and
shallowness
of
tone
which
seems
its
inevitable
drawback
for
the
mind
of
the
reader
always
bent
to
pick
up
clews
receives
no
impression
of
reality
or
life
rather
of
an
airless
elaborate
mechanism
and
the
book
remains
enthralling
but
insignificant
like
a
game
of
chess
not
a
work
of
human
art
it
seemed
the
cause
might
lie
partly
in
the
abrupt
attack
and
that
if
the
tale
were
gradually
approached
some
of
the
characters
introduced
as
it
were
beforehand
and
the
book
started
in
the
tone
of
a
novel
of
manners
and
experience
briefly
treated
this
defect
might
be
lessened
and
our
mystery
seem
to
inhere
in
life
the
tone
of
the
age
its
movement
the
mingling
of
races
and
classes
in
the
dollar
hunt
the
fiery
and
not
quite
unromantic
struggle
for
existence
with
its
changing
trades
and
scenery
and
two
types
in
particular
that
of
the
american
of
business
and
that
of
the
yankee
merchant
sailor
we
agreed
to
dwell
upon
at
some
length
and
make
the
woof
to
our
not
very
precious
warp
hence
dodd
father
and
pinkerton
and
nares
and
the
dromedary
picnics
and
the
railway
work
in
new
south
wales
the
last
an
unsolicited
testimonial
from
the
powers
that
be
for
the
tale
was
half
written
before
i
saw
carthew
squad
toil
in
the
rainy
cutting
at
south
clifton
or
heard
from
the
engineer
of
his
after
we
had
invented
at
some
expense
of
time
this
method
of
approaching
and
fortifying
our
police
novel
it
occurred
to
us
it
had
been
invented
previously
by
some
one
else
and
was
in
fact
however
painfully
different
the
results
may
seem
the
method
of
charles
dickens
in
his
later
work
i
see
you
staring
here
you
will
say
is
a
prodigious
quantity
of
theory
to
our
halfpenny
worth
of
police
novel
and
withal
not
a
shadow
of
an
answer
to
your
question
well
some
of
us
like
theory
after
so
long
a
piece
of
practice
these
may
be
indulged
for
a
few
pages
and
the
answer
is
at
hand
it
was
plainly
desirable
from
every
point
of
view
of
convenience
and
contrast
that
our
hero
and
narrator
should
partly
stand
aside
from
those
with
whom
he
mingles
and
be
but
a
in
the
dollar
hunt
thus
it
was
that
loudon
dodd
became
a
student
of
the
plastic
arts
and
that
our
story
came
to
visit
paris
and
look
in
at
barbizon
and
thus
it
is
dear
low
that
your
name
appears
in
the
address
of
this
epilogue
for
sure
if
any
person
can
here
appreciate
and
read
between
the
lines
it
must
be
you
and
one
other
our
friend
all
the
dominos
will
be
transparent
to
your
better
knowledge
the
statuary
contract
will
be
to
you
a
piece
of
ancient
history
and
you
will
not
have
now
heard
for
the
first
time
of
the
dangers
of
roussillon
dead
leaves
from
the
bas
breau
echoes
from
lavenue
and
the
rue
racine
memories
of
a
common
past
let
these
be
your
bookmarkers
as
you
read
and
if
you
care
for
naught
else
in
the
story
be
a
little
pleased
to
breathe
once
more
for
a
moment
the
airs
of
our
youth
the
end
