for

her

in

in

was
of

when
she
unlocked
the
front
door
to
her
of
evenings
there
was
no
one
to
expect
her
except
on
tuesdays
which
evening
it
so
happened
her
week
was
up
and
when
she
left
of

with
her

crumblessly
cleared
up
and
the
box
of
biscuit
and
can
tucked
unsuspectedly
behind

one
of

half
a
of
opening
her
door
upon
this
or
that
of

had
not
taught
her
heart
how
not
to
sink

the
feel

daily
rising
in

call
it

you
will
which

was
a
snowscape
night
closing
in
and
pink
cottage
windows
peering
out
from
under
eaves
she
could
visualize
that
interior
as
if
she
had
only
to
turn
the
frame
for
the
smell
of
wood
fire
and
the
snap
of
pine
logs
and
for
the
scene
of
two
chairs
and
the
wooden
crib
between
what
a
fragile
gracile
thing
is
the
mind
that
can
leap
thus
from
nine
bargain
basement
hours
of
hairpins
and
to
the
downy
business
of
lining
a
crib
in
land
and
warming
no
man
slippers
before
the
fire
of
imagination
there
was
that
picture
so
acidly
etched
into
miss
slayback
brain
that
she
had
only
to
close
her
eyes
in
the
sanctity
of
her
room
and
in
the
brief
moment
of
courting
sleep
feel
the
pink
penumbra
of
her
vision
begin
to
glow
of
late
years
or
more
specifically
for
two
years
and
eight
months
another

superseded
the

were
as

so
slightly
and
rightly
from

was

a
cock
feather
at
that
and
worn
without
sense
of

to
which
miss

was
fond
of
attributing
the
consequences
of

heliotrope

your

it
jimmie
i
can
see
you

stepping
up
with

innocent
grin
of
yours
you

i
did
know
you
were

from

i

to
myself
i
says
look

much

he
got
one
as
my

from

i

if

had

it
was

sassy

over

never
seen

reflect

pointing

at
the
closing
of

fourteenth

emporium
miss
slayback
whose
blondness
under
fatigue
could
become
ashy
emerged
from
the
almost
the
first
of
its
frantic
exodus
taking
the
place
of
her
weekly
appointment
in
the
entrance
of
the
popular
drug
store
adjoining
her
gaze
something
even
frantic
in
it
sifting
the
passing
crowd
at

fourteenth
street
pours
up
from
its
basements
down
from
its
lofts
and
out
from
its
stores
shows
and
arcades
in
a
great
homeward
torrent
a
sweeping
torrent
that
flows
full
flush
to
the
subway
the
elevated
and
the
surface
car
and
then
spreads
thinly
into
the
least
pretentious
of
the
city
homes
the
five
flights
up
the
two
rooms
rear
and
the
third
floor
back
standing
there
this
eager
tide
of
the
fourteenth
street
emporium
thus
released
by
the
flowed
past
miss
slayback
girls
in
shoes
and
gold
older
men
resigned
that
ambition
could
be
flayed
by
a
young
men
still
impatient
of
their
clerkship
it
was
into
the
trickle
of
these
last
that
miss
slayback
bored
her
glance
the
darting
eager
glance
of
hot
eyeballs
and
inner
trembling
she
was
not
so
pathetically
young
as
she
was
pathetically
blond
a
treacherous
kind
of
blondness
that
one
day
now
that
she
had
found
that
very
morning
her
first
gray
hair
would
leave
her
ashy
suddenly
with
a
small
catch
of
breath
that
was
audible
in
her
throat
miss
slayback
stepped
out
of
that
doorway
squirming
her
way
across
the
tight
congestion
of
the
sidewalk
to
its
curb
then
in
and
out
brushing
this
elbow
and
that
shoulder
worming
her
way
in
an
absolutely
supreme
anxiety
to
keep
in
view
a
brown
derby
hat
bobbing
right
briskly
along
with
the
crowd
a
bit
of

in

quite
a
caper
deploying
out
into

to
be
succulent

the
first
false
feint
of
spring
rising
as
it
were
from
a
sea
of
asphalt
across
this
park
miss
slayback
worked
her
rather
frenzied
way
breaking
into
a
run
when
the
derby
threatened
to
sink
into
the
confusion
of
a
hundred
others
and
finally
learning
to
keep
its
course
by
the
faint
but
distinguishing
fact
of
a
slight

back
into
the

protection

adjoining
she

and
her
little
face
somehow
smaller
from
chill
was
nevertheless
a
high
pink
at

around

her

her

up

stream
of
even
here
and
occasionally
one
turned
for
a
backward
glance
at
her
standing
there
so
frankly
indeterminate
suddenly
miss
slayback
adjusted
her
to
its
flop
over
her
right
ear
and
drawing
off
a
pair
of
silk
gloves
from
over
immaculately
new

ones
entered

jimmie

had
already
disposed
of
his
hat
and
gray
overcoat
and
tilting
the
chair
opposite
him
to
indicate
its
reservation
shook
open
his
evening
paper
the
waiter
withholding
the

at
this
sign
of
rendezvous
straight
toward
that
table
miss
slayback
worked
quick
swift
way
through
this
and
that
aisle
jerking
back
and
seating
herself
on
the
chair
opposite
almost
before
batch
could
raise
his
eyes
from
off
the
sporting
page
there
was
an
instant
of
silence
between
them
the
kind
of
silence
that
can
shape
itself
into
a
commentary
upon
the
inefficacy
of
mere
speech
a
widening
silence
which
as
they
sat
there
facing
deepened
until
when
she
finally
spoke
it
was
as
if
her
words
were
pebbles
dropping
down
into
a
well
do
look
so
surprised
jimmie
she
said
propping
her
face
calmly
even
boldly
into
the
palms
you
might
fall
off
the
christmas
tree
above
the
snug
collar
and
bow
tie
batch
face
was
taking
on
a
dull
tinge
that
spread
back
even
reddening
his
ears
batch
had
the
frontal
bone
of
a
clerk
the
glasses
of
the
literarily
astigmatic
and
the
sartorial
perfection
that
only
the
rich
can
afford
not
to
attain
he
was
staring
now
quite
frankly
and
his
mouth
had
fallen
open
gert
he
said
yes
said
miss
slayback
her
insouciance
gaining
with
his
discomposure
her
eyes
widening
and
then
a
dolly
kind
of
glassiness
seeming
to
set
in
you
was
expecting
me
jimmie
he
jerked
up
his
head
not
meeting
her
glance
what
the
idea
of
the
comedy
you
do
look
glad
to
see
me
jimmie
if
you
think
you
funny
she
was
working
out
of
and
then
back
into
the
freshly
white
gloves
in
a
betraying
kind
of
nervousness
that
belied
the
toss
of
her
voice
well
of
all
things
mad
just
because
you
did
seem
to
be
expecting
me
i
there
some
things
that
are
just
the
limit
that
what
they
are
some
things
that
are
just
the
limit
that
no
fellow
would
stand
from
any
girl
and
this
this
is
one
of
them
her
lips
were
trembling
now
you
you
bet
your
life
there
some
things
that
are
just
the
limit
he
slid
out
his
watch
pushing
back
well
i
guess
this
place
is
too
small
for
a
fellow
and
a
girl
that
can
follow
him
around
town
like
a
like
she
sat
forward
grasping
the
her

her

you
dare
to

up

miss
slayback
her
hands
still
rigidly
over
the
and
her
glance
like
a
steady
drill
into
batch
own
there
was
a
second
of
this
silence
while
the
waiter
withdrew
and
then
batch
whipped
out
his
watch

back

box
edge

her
composure

they
met
at
the
door
kissing
on
the
inside
and
the
outside
of
it
at
the
head
of
the
fourth
third
and
the
second
balustrade
down
we
always
make
little
love
landings
jimmie
so
we
ca
ever
get
tired
climbing
them
yep
outside
there
was
still
a
pink
glow
in
a
clean
sky
the
first
flush
of
spring
in
the
air
had
died
leaving
chill
they
walked
briskly
arm
in
arm
down
the
asphalt
incline
of
sidewalk
leading
from
their
apartment
house
a
new
street
of
canned
homes
built
on
a
hillside
the
sepulchral
abode
of
the
city
trapped
whose
only
escape
is
down
the
and
then
only
when
the
alternative
is
death
at
the
base
of
the
hill
there
flows
in
constant
hubbub
a
great
artery
of
street
repeating
itself
mile
after
mile
in
terms
of
the
butcher
the
baker
and
the
of
a
million
dollar
corporation
housewives
with
perambulators
and
shopping
bags
children
on
rollerskates
the
din
of
small
tradesmen
and
the
humdrum
of
every
city
block
where
the
homes
remain
unbearded
all
summer
and
every
wife
is
on
haggling
terms
with
the
purveyor
of
her
evening
roundsteak
and
mess
of
rutabaga
then
there
is
the
provender
too
sure
of
a
crowd
offering
creed
propaganda
patent
medicine
and
politics
it
is
the
pulpit
of
the
reformer
and
the
housetop
of
the
fanatic
this
soapbox
from
it
the
voice
to
the
city
is
often
a
pious
one
an
impious
one
and
almost
always
a
raucous
one
luther
and
sophocles
and
even
a
citizen
of
nazareth
made
of
the
four
winds
of
the
street
corner
the
walls
of
a
temple
of
wisdom
what
more
fitting
acropolis
for
freedom
of
speech
than
the
great
turning
from
the
incline
of
into
this
petty
baghdad
of
the
petty
wise
the
voice
of
the
street
corner
lifted
itself
above
the
inarticulate
din
of
the
thoroughfare
a
youth
thewed
like
an
ox
surmounted
on
a
stack
of
three
self
provided
boxes
his
silhouette
thrown
out
against
a
sky
that
was
almost
ready
to
break
out
in
stars
a
crowd
tightening
about
him

a
soldier

one
of

the
spirit
of
cowardice

make
a
coward
the
cowards
and
the
quitters
and
the
slackers

buttonhole
patriot

any
reason

side

i
want
to
say
to
you
that
them
four
months
of
mine
face
to
face
with
life
and
with
death

done
more
for
me
than
all
my
civilian
years
put
together
cheers
i
be
a
different
man
if
i
live
to
come
back
home
after
this
war
and

up
my
work

as
a
draftsman
why
i
seen
weaklings
and
failures
and
even
ninnies
go
into
them
trenches
and
come
out
oh
yes
plenty
of
them
do
come
out
men
men
that
have
got
close
enough
down
to
the
facts
of
things
to
feel
new
realizations
of
what
life
means
come
over
them
men
that
have
gotten
back
their
pep
their
ambitions
their
unselfishness
that
what
war
can
do
for
your
men
you
women
who
are
helping
them
to
foster
the
spirit

holding
back

cheating
their
government

what
war
can
do
for
your
men
make
of
them
the
kind
of
men
who
some
day
can
face
their
children
without
having
to
hang
their
heads
men
who
can
answer
for
their
part
in
making
the
world
a
safe
place
for
democracy
an
hour
they
stood
there
the
air
quieting
but
chilling
and
lavishly
sown
stars
cropping
out
street
lights
had
come
out
too
throwing
up
in
ever
darker
relief
the
figure
above
the
heads
of
the
crowd
his
voice
had
coarsened
and
taken
on
a
raw
edge
but
every
gesture
was
flung
from
the
socket
and
from
where
they
had
forced
themselves
into
the
tight
circle
gertie
slayback
her
mouth
fallen
open
and
her
head
still
back
could
see
the
sinews
of
him
ripple
under
khaki
and
the
diaphragm
lift
for
voice
there
was
a
shift
of
speakers
then
this
time
a
private
still
too
rangy
but
his
looseness
of
frame
seeming
already
to
conform
to
the
exigency
of
uniform
come
on
jimmie
i
i
cold
they
worked
out
into
the
freedom
of
the
sidewalk
and
for
ten
minutes
down
blocks
of
petty
shops
already
lighted
walked
in
a
silence
that
grew
apace
he
was
suddenly
conscious
that
she
was
crying
quietly
her
handkerchief
wadded
against
her
mouth
he
strode
on
with
a
scowl
and
his
head
bent
let
sit
down
in
this
little
park
jimmie
i
tired
they
rested
on
a
bench
on
one
of
those
small
triangles
of
breathing
space
which
the
city
ekes
out
now
and
then
mill
ends
of
land
parcels
he
took
immediately
to
roving
the
toe
of
his
shoe
in
and
out
among
the
gravel
she
stole
out
her
hand
to
his
arm
well
jimmie
her
voice
was
in
the
gauze
of
a
whisper
that
hardly
left
her
throat
well
what
he
said
still
toeing
there
there
a
lot
of
things
we
never
thought
about
jimmie
aw
eh
jimmie
you
mean
never
thought
about
it
what
do
you
mean
i
know
what
i
mean
alrighty
i
i
was
the
one
that
suggested
it
jimmie
but
but
you
fell
in
i
i
just
could
bear
to
think
of
it
jimmie
your
going
and
all
i
suggested
it
but
but
you
fell
in
say
when
a
fellow
shoved
he
falls
i
never
gave
a
thought
to
sneaking
an
exemption
until
it
was
put
in
my
head
i
smash
the
fellow
in
the
face
that
calls
me
coward
i
will
you
could
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
jimmie
looking
at
it
his
way
all
of
a
sudden
you
could
knock
me
down
do
think
i
was
ever
strong
enough
for
the
whole
business
i
mean
the
exemption
part
i
was
going
to
say
anything
what
the
use
seeing
the
way
you
had
your
heart
set
on
on
things
but
the
whole
business
if
you
want
to
know
it
went
against
my
grain
smash
the
fellow
in
the
face
that
calls
me
coward
i
know
jimmie
you
you
right
it
was
me
suggested
hurrying
things
like
this
sneakin
oh
god

lay

going
to
see
it
through
i
guess

fellows
before

will
be
after
me

have
done
worse
i
going
to
see
it
through
all

got
to
say
is
i
smash
up
the
fellow
calls
me
coward
come
on
forget
it
let
go
she
was
close
to
him
her
cheek
crinkled
against
his
with
the
frank
kind
of
social
unconsciousness
the
park
bench
seems
to
engender
come
on
gert
i
got
a
hunger
on
jimmie

me
think
i
thinking
too
much

time
after
after
that
little
central
street
trouble
of
mine
i
got
a
book
in
my
trunk

a
fine
thing

for
a
fellow

at
his
shoulder
so
that

he
faced
her
jimmie

idea

a
flat
what
anything
he
let
drop
his
head
to
hide
his
eyes
do
you
know
it
is
said
that
on
the
desert
of
sahara
the
slope
of
sorrento
and
the
marble
of
fifth
avenue
the
sun
can
shine
whitest
there
is
an
iridescence
to
its
glittering
on
bleached
sand
blue
bay
and
carrara
façade
that
is
sheer
light
distilled
to
its
utmost
on
one
such
day
when
standing
on
the
high
slope
of
fifth
avenue
where
it
rises
toward
the
park
and
looking
down
on
it
surging
to
and
fro
it
was
as
if
so
manifest
the
brilliancy
every
head
wore
a
tin
helmet
parrying
sunlight
at
a
thousand
angles
of
refraction
all
this
glittering
midstream
is
swept
to
the
clean
sheen
of
a
strip
of
moire
this
splendid
desolation
blocked
on
each
side
by
crowds
half
the
density
of
the
sidewalk
on
one
of
these
saturdays
dedicated
by
a
growing
tradition
to
this
or
that
national
expression
the
regiment
to
a
flare
of
music
that
made
the
heart
leap
out
against
its
walls
turned
into
a
scene
thus
swept
clean
for
it
a
wave
of
olive
drab
impeccable
row
after
impeccable
row
of
legs
advancing
recruits
raw
if
you
will
but
already
caparisoned
sniffing
and
scenting
as
it
were
for
the
great
primordial
mire
of
war
there
is
no
state
of
being
so
finely
sensitized
as
national
consciousness
a
gauntlet
down
and
it
surges
up
one
ripple
of
a
flag
defended
can
a
nation
how
bitter
and
how
sweet
it
is
to
give
a
soldier
to
the
seething
kinetic
chemistry
of
such
mingling
emotions
there
were
women
who
stood
in
the
frontal
crowds
of
the
sidewalks
stifling
hysteria
or
ran
after
in
terror
at
sight
of
one
so
personally
hers
receding
in
that
great
impersonal
wave
of
olive
drab
and
yet
the
air
was
martial
with
banner
and
with
shout
and
the
ecstasy
of
such
moments
is
like
a
dam
against
reality
pressing
it
back
it
is
in
the
pompless
watches
of
the
night
or
of
too
long
days
that
such
dams
break
excoriating
for
the
thirty
blocks
of
its
course
gertie
slayback
followed
that
wave
of
men
half
run
and
half
walk
down
from
the
curb
and
at
the
beck
and
call
of
this
or
that
policeman
up
again
only
to
find
opportunity
for
still
another
dive
out
from
the
invisible
roping
off
of
the
sidewalk
crowds
from
the
middle
of
his
line
she
could
see
sometimes
the
tail
of
jimmie
batch
glance
roving
for
her
but
to
all
purports
his
eye
was
solely
for
his
own
replica
in
front
of
him
and
at
such
times
when
he
marched
his
back
had
a
little
additional
straightness
that
was
almost
swayback
nor
was
gertie
slayback
crying
on
the
contrary
she
was
inclined
to
laughter
a
little
too
inclined
to
a
high
and
brittle
sort
of
dissonance
over
which
she
seemed
to
have
no
control
jimmie
so
long
jimmie
tramp
tramp
jimmie
so
long
jimmie
at
fourteenth
street
and
to
the
solemn
stroke
of
one
from
a
tower
she
broke
off
suddenly
without
even
a
second
look
back
dodging
under
the
very
arms
of
the
crowd
as
she
ran
out
from
it
she
was
one
and
minutes
late
when
she
punched
the
beside
the
complaints
and
adjustment
desk
in
the
ii
sieve
of
fulfilment
how
constant
a
stream
is
the
runnel
of
men
small
affairs
dynasties
may
totter
and
half
the
world
bleed
to
death
but
one
or
the
other
corner
goes
on
forever
at
a
moment
when
the
shadow
of
was
over
the
country
like
a
pair
of
black
wings
lowering
harry
ross
who
swooned
at
the
sight
of
blood
from
a
penknife
scratch
down
the
hand
of
her
son
but
yawned
over
the
statistics
of
the
casualties
at
verdun
lifted
a
lid
from
a
pot
that
exuded
immediate
savory
fumes
prodded
with
a
fork
at
its
content
her
concern
boiled
down
to
deal
solely
with
stew
an
on
a
small
shelf
edged
in
scalloped
white
oilcloth
ticked
with
precision
into
a
kitchen
so
correspondingly
spick
and
span
that
even
its
silence
smelled
scoured
rows
of
tins
shining
into
it
a
kind
of
dusk
soot
floating
in
it
began
to
filter
down
the
dimming
them
ross
lowered
the
shade
and
lighted
the
so
short
that
in
the
long
run
she
wormed
first
through
a
crowd
she
was
full
of
the
genial
curves
that
though
they
bespoke
three
lumps
in
her
coffee
in
an
elevator
and
escalator
age
had
not
yet
reached
uncongenial
proportions
in
fact
now
brushing
with
her
bare
forearm
across
her
moistly
pink
face
she
was
like
flora
who
rather
than
fade
became
buxom
a
door
slammed
in
an
outer
hall
as
she
was
still
stirring
and
looking
down
into

round
table

its
white
napery
and
decently
flowered
china
beside

looking
out
upon
a
wall
almost
within

a
canary
with
a
curtain
about
the

headless
beside

window
covered
in
flowered
chintz

that

jammed
the

between

and

back
shoving

closer
to

table

was
blond
to
ashiness
so
that
the

graying
unlined
polished
to

he
was
ten
years

years

that
youth
of

preserved
them

washing
and
i
could

the
money
part
harry
easy
he
regarded
her
with
his
jaw
dropped
in
the
act
of
chewing
by
gad
where
do
you
plant
it
it
it
the
way
i
scrimp
harry
another
woman

hard
for
a
home
body
like

harry

reached
across
the
table
for
her
wrist
poor
little
soul
he
said
you
do
see
let
him
go
harry
if
if
he
wants
it
i
can
manage
the
money
his
scowl
returned
darkening
him
no
unger
never
seen
the
inside
of
a
high
school
much
less
a
college
and
i
guess
he
made
as
good
a
pile
as
most
i
worked
for
the
butcher
and
the
landlord
all
my
life
and
now
i
ai
going
to
begin
being
a
slave
to
my
boy
there
been
two
or
three
times
in
my
life
where
for
want
of
a
few
dirty
dollars
to
make
a
right
start
i
be
a
rich
man
my
boy
going
to
get
that
right
start
but
harry
college
will
i
seen
money
in
long
before
unger
ever
dreamed
of
producing
it
i
sicked
him
onto
official
chaperon
when
every
manager
in
town
had
turned
it
down
i
went
down
and
seen
doing
white
elephant
in
a
yiddish
theater
and
wired
unger
out
in
chicago
to
come
back
and
grab
it
for
broadway
where
it
got
me
nowhere
because
i
whiled
away
the
best
fifteen
years
of
my
life
in
an
burg
and
then
when
i
came
down
here
too
late
in
life
got
in
the
rut
of
a
salaried
man
well
where
it
got
me
it
going
to
get
my
son
i
missing
a
chance
that
mark

me
a
rich
man

leaning
across

hands
clasping
its
edge
her
small
plump
face
even
pinker
he
threw
out
his
legs
beneath
the
table
and
sat
back
hands
deep
in
pockets
and
a
toothpick
hanging
limp
from
between
lips
that
were
sagging
gad
if
i
had
my
life
to
live
over
again
as
a
salaried
man
i
i
hang
myself
first
the
way
to
start
a
boy
to
a
million
dollars
in
this
business
is
to
start
him
young
in
the
of
a

he
released
her
then
feeling
for
an
envelope
in
an
inner
pocket
and
standing
there
above
the
disarrayed
executed
some
rapid
figures
across
the
back
of
it
she
stood
for
a
moment
regarding
him
hands
pressed
against
the
sting
of
her
cheeks
tears
flowing
down
over
her
smile
then
she
took
up
the
plate
of
cloying
fritters
and
tiptoed
out
opening
softly
the
door
to
a
slit
of
a
room
across
the
hall
in
the
patch
of
light
let
in
by
that
opened
door
drawn
up
before
a
small
table
face
toward
her
ravaged
with
recent
tears
and
lips
almost
quivering
her
son
lay
in
the
ready
kind
of
slumber
youth
can
bring
to
any
woe
she
tiptoed
up
beside
him
placing
the
plate
of
fritters
back
on
a
pile
of
books
let
her
hands
run
lightly
over
his
hair
kissed
him
on
each
swollen
lid
my
son
my
little
boy
my
little
boy
where
broadway
leaves
off
its
and
its
its
theaters
and
its
very
odd
hawaiian
cabarets
upper
broadway
widening
slightly
takes
up
its
macadamized
rush
through
the
city
in
which
rise
off
foundations
of
the
greengrocer
shops
the
and
the
and
confectionery
establishments
of
middle
new
york
in
a
apartment
most
recently
erected
on
a
tract
of
upper
broadway
belonging
to
and
named
after
the
youngest
scion
of
an
ancestor
whose
had
turned
to
kingdoms
the
fifteenth
layer
of
this
gigantic
honeycomb
overlooked
from
its
seventeen
outside
windows
the
great
babylonian
valley
of
the
city
the
wide
blade
of
the
river
shining
and
curving
slightly
like
an
arabian
dagger
and
the
embankment
of
new
jersey
palisades
piled
against
the
sky
with
the
effect
of
angry
horizon
nights
viewed
from
one
of
the
seventeen
windows
it
was
as
if
the
river
flowed
under
a
sullen
sheath
which
undulated
to
its
curves
on
clear
days
it
threw
off
light
like
parrying
steel
in
sunshine
were
days
when
gazing
out
toward
it
ross
whose
heart
was
like
a
slow
ache
of
area
could
almost
feel
its
laving
quality
and
after
the
passage
of
a
or
the
soothing
folding
of
the
water
down
over
and
upon
itself
often
with
the
sun
setting
pink
and
whole
above
the
palisades
the
very
copper
glow
which
was
struck
off
the
water
would
beat
against
her
own
west
windows
and
as
if
smarting
under
the
brilliance
tears
would
come
sometimes
staggering
and
staggering
down
long
after
the
glow
was
cold
with
such
a
sunset
already
waned
and
the
valley
of
unrest
fifteen
stories
below
popping
out
into
electric
signs
and
the
red
of
streets
constantly
in
the
remaking
harry
ross
from
the
corner
window
of
her
seventeen
looked
down
on
it
from
under
lids
that
were
rimmed
in
red
beneath
the
swirl
of
a
gown
that
lay
in
an
iridescent
avalanche
of
sequins
about
her
feet
her
foot
tilted
to
an
unbelievable
hypothenuse
off
a
heel
beat
a
small
and
twinkling
tattoo
her
fingers
tattooing
too
along
the
how
insidiously
do
the
years
nibble
in
how
and
how
cocksure
the
one
morning
and
the
first
gray
hair
which
has
been
turning
from
the
cradle
arrives
another
the
mirror
shows
back
a
sag
beneath
the
eyes
that
sag
had
come
now
to
ross
giving
her
a
look
of
unconquerable
weariness
the
streak
of
quicksilver
had
come
too
but
more
successfully
combated
the
head
lying
back
against
the
brocade
chair
was
guilty
of
new
gleams
brass
with
a
greenish
alloy
sitting
there
with
the
look
of
unshed
tears
seeming
to
form
a
film
over
her
gaze
it
was
as
if
the
dusk
flowing
into
a
silence
that
was
solemnly
shaped
to
receive
it
folded
her
in
more
and
more
obscuring
her
a
door
opened
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
letting
in
a
patch
of
hall
light
and
a
dark
figure
coming
into
silhouette
against
it
you
there
she
sprang
up
yes
harry
yes
good
lord
sitting
in
the
dark
again
he
turned
a
wall
key
three
lamps
a
cluster
of
grapes
and
a
center
bowl
of
alabaster
flashing
up
the
familiar
spectacle
of
louis
fourteenth
and
the
interior
decorator
turpitude
a
brocade
divan
backed
up
by
a
table
with
curly
legs
a
maze
of
smaller
tables
a
marble
psyche
holding
out
the
cluster
of
pink
grapes
a
gilt
grand
piano
festooned
in
rosebuds
around
through
these
ross
walked
quickly
winding
his
hands
rubbing
them
well
here
i

her
voice
jerked
up
to
an
off
pitch
and
he
flung
himself
down
on
the
couch
his
stiff
expanse
of
dress
shirt
bulging
and
straining
at
the
studs
a
bit
redder
and
stouter
too
he
was
constantly
rearing
his
chin
away
from
the
chafing
edge
of
his
collar
o

and

over

time
she
was
quivering
so
against
sobs
that
her
lips
were
drawn
in
against
her
teeth
by
the
great
draught
of
her
breathing
i

at
a
wreath
of
roses
in
the
light
carpet

compressed

with
fist
into
palm

to
little
dry
moans
that

with
regularity

was
still
swaying
in
her
chair
eyes
closed

your
decree

without
do
talk
she
said
a
frown
lowering
over
her
closed
eyes
and
pressing
two
fingers
against
each
temple
do
talk
he
walked
to
the
window
in
a
state
of
great
perturbation
stood
pulling
inward
his
lips
and
staring
down
into
the
now
brilliantly
lighted
flow
of
broadway
turned
into
the
room
with
short
hasty
strides
then
back
again
came
to
confront
her
aw

regarding
her
chewing
backward
and
forward
along
his
fingertips

her
lips
bitterly

she
nodded
again
her
lips
pressed
back
against
outburst
if
ever
there
was
a
good
little
woman
millie
and
one
that
deserves
better
than
me
it
do
she
cried
do
do
do
i
go
quick
now
he
hesitated
stood
regarding
her
there
in
the
chair
eyes
squeezed
closed
like
iphigenia
praying
for
death
when
exiled
in
tauris
millie
i
go
she
cried
the
wail
clinging
to
her
lips
he
felt
round
for
his
hat
his
gaze
obscured
behind
the
shining
glasses
tiptoed
out
round
the
archipelago
of
too
much
furniture
groped
for
the
turning
it
noiselessly
and
stood
for
the
instant
looking
back
at
her
bathed
in
the
rosy
light
and
seated
upright
like
a
sleeping
ariadne
opened
the
door
to
a
slit
that
closed
silently
after
him
she
sat
thus
for
three
hours
after
the
wail
still
uppermost
on
the
silence
at
ten
with
a
gust
that
swayed
the
heavy
drapes
her
son
burst
in
upon
the
room
his
stride
kicking
the
door
before
he
opened
it
six
feet
in
his
gymnasium
shoes
and
with
a
ripple
of
muscle
beneath
the
campus
coat
for
college
men
he
had
emerged
from
the
three
years
into
man
complete
estate
which
at
nineteen
is
that
patch
of
territory
at
youth
feet
known
as
the
world
gray
eyed
his
dark
lashes
long
enough
to
threaten
to
curl
the
lean
line
of
his
jaw
squaring
after
the
manner
of
america
fondest
version
of
her
manhood
he
was
already
in
danger
of
fond
illusions
and
fond
mommas
hello
mother
he
said
striding
quickly
through
the
chairs
and
over
to
where
she
sat
edwin
thought
i
sleep
home
mother
he
kissed
her
lightly
perking
up
her
shoulder
butterflies
of
green
sequins
and
standing
off
to
observe
got
to
hand
it
to
my
little
mother
for
quiet
and
sumptuous
some
classy
he
ran
his
hand
against
the
lay
of
the
sequins
absorbed
in
a
conscious
kind
of
gaiety
she
moistened
her
lips
trying
to
smile
oh
boy
she
said
edwin
holding
to
his
forearm
with
fingers
that
tightened
into
it
mother
he
said
pulling
at
his
coat
lapels
with
a
squaring
of
shoulders
you
you
going
to
be
a
dead
game
little
sport
she
was
looking
ahead
now
abstraction
growing
in
her
white
face
huh
he
fell
into
short
strides
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
couch
front
i
i
guess
i
might
have
mentioned
it
before
mother
but
but
oh
hang
when
a
fellow
a
senior
it
it
all
he
can
do
to
get
home
once
in
a
while
and
and
what
the
use
talking
about
a
thing
anyway
before
it
breaks
right
and
well
everybody
knows
it
up
to
us
college
fellows
college
men
to
lead
the
others
and
show
our
country
what
made
of
now
that
she
needs
us
eh
little
mother
she
looked
up
at
him
with
the
tremulous
smile
still
trying
to
break
through
my
boy

mix
with
the
best
of
that
not

against

again
and
her
tears

attention
little
mother

she
lay
back
her
head
laughing
crying
sobbing
choking
o
god
take
him
and
bring
him
back
to
me
on
a
day
when
sky
and
water
were
so
identically
blue
that
they
met
in
perfect
horizon
the
mounted
fore
and
aft
with
a
pair
of
black
guns
that
lifted
snouts
slightly
to
the
impeccable
blue
slipped
quietly
and
without
even
a
newspaper
into
a
frivolous
midstream
that
kicked
up
little
lace
edged
wavelets
undulating
flounces
of
them
a
blur
of
faces
rose
above
faces
that
looking
back
receded
finally
the
last
flag
and
the
last
kerchief
became
vapor
against
the
frantically
even
perilously
forward
her
small
flag
thrust
desperately
beyond
the
rail
ross
who
had
lost
a
saving
sense
of
time
and
place
leaned
after
that
ship
receding
in
majesty
long
after
it
had
curved
from
view
the
crowd
not
a
one
women
in
spite
of
themselves
with
lips
whitening
men
grim
with
pride
and
an
innermost
bleeding
sagged
suddenly
thinning
and
trickling
back
into
the
great
impersonal
maw
of
the
city
apart
from
the
rush
of
the
exodus
a
youth
remained
at
the
rail
gazing
out
and
quivering
for
the
smell
of
war
finally
he
too
turned
back
reluctantly
now
only
ross
an
hour
she
stood
there
a
solitary
figure
at
the
rail
holding
to
her
large
black
hat
her
skirts
whipped
to
her
body
and
snapping
forward
in
the
breeze
the
sun
struck
off
points
from
the
water
animating
it
with
a
it
found
out
in
a
flash
the
top
to
her
from
facet
to
facet
my
boy
my
little
boy
a
pair
of
wiping
their
hands
on
came
after
a
while
to
the
door
of
the
to
observe
and
comment
conscious
of
that
observation
she
moved
then
through
the
great
dank
sheds
in
and
among
the
bales
and
boxes
down
a
flight
of
stairs
and
out
to
the
cobbled
street
her
the
last
at
the
entrance
stood
off
at
a
slant
the
chauffeur
lopping
slightly
and
dozing
his
face
scarcely
above
the
she
passed
him
with
unnecessary
stealth
her
heels
occasionally
wedging
between
the
cobbles
and
jerking
her
up
two
hours
she
walked
thus
invariably
next
to
the
water
edge
or
in
the
first
street
running
parallel
to
it
gazed
at
and
sang
after
her
and
stretched
out
in
the
first
sun
of
spring
opened
their
eyes
to
her
passing
often
staring
after
her
under
lazy
lids
behind
a
drawn
veil
her
lips
were
moving
but
inaudibly
now
blocks
of
them
painted
the
gray
of
war
stood
waiting
shipment
engines
ready
to
throb
into
no
telling
what
mire
once
a
van
of
knitted
stuffs
always
the
gray
corded
and
bound
into
bales
rumbled
by
close
enough
to
graze
and
send
her
stumbling
back
she
stood
for
a
moment
watching
it
lumber
up
alongside
a
dock
it
was
dusk
when
she
emerged
from
the
rather
sinister
end
of
west
street
into
battery
park
receding
in
a
gracious
curve
from
the
water
tier
after
tier
of
lights
had
begun
to
prick
out
in
the
of
skyscraping
the
little
park
after
the
stampede
settled
back
into
a
sort
of
lamplit
quiet
dark
figures
the
dregs
of
a
city
day
here
and
there
on
its
benches
the
of
began
to
blink
out
then
all
except
the
tallest
tower
in
the
world
rising
in
the
glory
of
its
own
spotlight
into
a
rococo
pinnacle
of
man
accomplishment
strolling
the
edge
of
that
park
so
close
to
the
water
that
she
could
hear
it
seethe
in
the
receding
a
policeman
finally
took
to
following
ross
his
measured
tread
behind
hers
his
rapping
out
every
so
often
she
found
out
a
bench
then
and
never
out
of
his
view
sat
looking
out
across
the
infinitude
of
blackness
to
where
the
bay
so
casually
meets
the
sea
night
dampness
had
sent
her
shivering
the
plumage
of
her
hat
the
ferny
feathers
of
the
drooping
almost
grotesquely
over
the
brim
a
small
detachment
of
boy
scouts
sturdy
with
an
enormous
sense
of
uniform
and
valor
marched
through
the
asphalt
alleys
of
the
park
with
trained
regimental
precision
small
boys
with
clean
lifted
faces
a
fife
and
drum
came
up
the
road
high
over
the
water
a
light
had
come
out
liberty
torch
watching
it
and
quickened
by
the
fife
and
drum
to
an
erect
sitting
posture
ross
slid
forward
on
her
bench
lips
opening
the
policeman
standing
off
rapped
twice
and
when
she
rose
almost
running
toward
the
lights
of
the
elevated
station
followed
within
her
apartment
on
upper
broadway
not
even
a
hall
light
burned
when
she
let
herself
in
with
her
key
at
the
remote
end
of
the
aisle
of
blackness
a
slit
of
yellow
showed
beneath
the
door
behind
it
the
babble
of
servants
voices
she
entered
with
a
stealth
that
was
well
under
cover
of
those
voices
groping
into
the
first
door
at
her
right
feeling
round
for
the
wall
key
switching
the
old
room
into
immediate
light
stood
for
a
moment
her
plumage
drooping
damply
to
her
shoulders
blue
foulard
dress
snagged
in
two
places
her
gold
mesh
bag
with
the
top
hanging
low
from
the
crook
of
her
little
finger
a
clock
ticked
with
almost
an
echo
into
the
rather
vast
silence
she
entered
finally
sidling
in
among
the
chairs
a
great
mound
of
gray
yarn
uncut
skein
after
uncut
skein
of
it
rose
off
the
brocade
divan
more
of
them
piled
in
systematic
pyramids
on
three
chairs
she
dropped
at
sight
of
it
to
the
floor
beside
the
couch
burying
her
face
in
its
fluff
grasping
it
in
handfuls
writhing
into
it
surges
of
merciful
sobs
came
sweeping
through
and
through
her
after
a
while
with
a
pair
of
long
needles
she
fell
to
knitting
with
a
fast
even
furious
ambidexterity
her
mouth
pursing
up
with
a
driving
intensity
her
boring
gaze
so
concentrated
on
the
thing
in
hand
that
her
eyes
seemed
to
cross
dawn
broke
upon
her
there
her
hat
still
cockily
awry
tears
dried
in
a
vitrified
gleaming
down
her
cheeks
beneath
her
flying
fingers
a
sleeveless
waistcoat
was
taking
shape
a
soldier
inner
jacket
against
the
dam
of
trenches
at
sunup
it
lay
completed
spread
out
as
if
the
first
of
a
pile
the
first
noises
of
the
city
began
to
rise
remotely
a
bell
pealed
off
somewhere
day
began
to
raise
its
conglomerate
voice
on
her
knees
beside
the
couch
there
the
second
waistcoat
was
already
taking
shape
beneath
the
cocksure
needles
the
old
pinkly
moist
look
had
come
out
in
her
face
one
million
boys
out
there
were
needing
iii
pl
when
the
two
sides
of
every
story
are
told
henry
viii
may
establish
an
alibi
or
two
shylock
and
the
system
meet
over
and
melt
that
too
too
solid
pound
of
flesh
and
xantippe
herself
the
sturdier
man
than
socrates
give
ready
lie
to
what
is
called
the
shrew
in
her
landladies
whole
generations
of
them
oh
so
long
unheard
may
rise
in
one
indictment
of
the
boarder
the
scarred
and
the
empty
trunk
nailed
to
the
floor
in
security
for
the
unpaid
bill
sheets
and
the
terror
of
sudden
fire
the
silent
newcomer
in
the
third
floor
back
hustled
out
one
night
in
handcuffs
the
sobs
of
the
blond
girl
so
suddenly
terrified
of
and
wringing
her
ringless
hands
in
the
the
smell
of
escaping
gas
and
the
tightly
packed
keyhole
the
unsuspected
flutes
that
lurk
in
boarders
trunks
towels
that
querulous
and
endless
paean
of
the
lodger
the
high
cost
of
liver
and
dried
peaches
of
canned
corn
and
round
steak
tired
bombazine
procession
wrapped
in
the
greasy
odors
of
years
of
and
emptying
slops
airing
the
gassy
slit
of
room
after
the
coroner
and
padding
from
floor
to
floor
on
a
mission
of
towels
and
towels
and
towels
sometimes
climbing
from
floor
to
floor
a
still
warm
supply
of
them
looped
over
one
arm
kaufman
who
wore
bombazine
but
unspotted
and
with
crisp
net
frills
at
the
throat
and
upon
whose
face
the
years
had
written
their
chirography
in
invisible
ink
would
sit
suddenly
there
in
the
narrow
gloom
of
her
halls
head
against
the
balustrade
oftener
than
not
the
katz
boy
from
the
third
floor
front
would
come
down
the
stairs
and
past
her
jumping
the
last
four
steps
of
each
flight
irving
quit
your
noise
in
the
hall
aw
ai
you
ashamed
a
big
boy
like
you
and
suss
with
her
neuralgia
aw
the
slam
of
a
door
clipping
off
this
insolence
after
a
while
she
would
resume
her
climb
and
yet
in
kaufman
private
in
west
street
one
of
a
breastwork
of
brownstone
fronts
lined
up
stoop
for
stoop
story
for
story
and
for
there
were
few
enough
greasy
odors
except
upon
the
weekly
occasion
of
monday
boiled
dinner
and
whatever
the
status
of
liver
and
dried
peaches
canned
corn
and
round
steak
her
menus
remained
static
so
static
that
in
the
basement
and
at
a
remote
end
of
the
long
table
katz
with
her
napkin
tucked
well
under
her
third
chin
turned
from
the
protruding
husband
at
her
right
to
her
left
neighbor
shielding
her
remark
with
her
hand
am
i
right
finshriber
i
just
said
to
my
husband
in
the
five
years
we
been
here
she
should
just
give
us
once
a
change
from
lamb
and
noodles
say
you
should
complain
yet
with
me
it
six
and
a
half
years
day
after
easter
day
since
i
asked
myself
that
question
first
even
my
irving
says
to
me
up
in
the
room
jumping
up
and
down
on
the
hearth
like
he
had
four
legs
i
heard
him
katz
on
my
ceiling
like
he
had
eight
legs
he
says
why
i
feel
like
saying
baa
saying
what
sheep
talk
finshriber
like
a
sheep
goes
oh
i
got
so
many
friday
nights
lamb
in
me
mamma
he
said
quick
like
a
flash
that
child
is
finshriber
dipped
her
head
and
her
glance
all
her
drooping
features
pulled
even
farther
down
at
their
corners
i
ai
the
one
to
complain
katz
and
i
always
say
when
you
come
right
down
to
it
maybe
kaufman
house
is
as
good
as
the
next
one
but
i
wish
though
finshriber
you
would
hear
what
spritz
says
at
her
they
get
for
breakfast
fried
you
can
imagine
katz
since
my
poor
husband
death
how
much
appetite
i
got
left
but
i
say
katz
just
for
the
principle
of
the
thing
it
would
not
hurt
once
if
kaufman
could
give
somebody
else
besides
her
own
daughter
and
vetsburg
the
white
meat
from
everything
would
it
it
a
shame
before
the
boarders
she
knows
pinshriber
how
my
husband
likes
breast
from
the
chicken
you
think
once
he
gets
it
no
i
always
tell
him
not
chickens
come
doublebreasted
like
overcoats
can
he
get
it
in
this
house
with
vetsburg
such
a
star
boarder
last
night
chicken
let
me
tell
you
i
do
wish
it
to
a
dog
such
a
piece
of
dark
meat
with
gizzard
i
had
to
swallow
katz
adjusted
with
greater
security
the
expanse
of
white
napkin
across
her
ample
bosom
gold
rings
and
a
marriage
band
flashed
in
and
out
among
the
litter
of
small
dishes
surrounding
her
and
a
pouncing
fork
of
short
sure
stab
right
away
my
husband
gets
mad
when
i
say
the
same
thing
we
do
like
it
we
should
move
he
says
like
moving
is
so
easy
if
you
got
two
chairs
and
a
hair
mattress
to
take
with
you
but
i
always
say
katz
i
do
blame
kaufman
herself
for
what
goes
on
there
good
woman
if
there
ever
was
one
they
do
come
any
better
or
any
better
looking
my
husband
always
says
i
tell
him
can
stand
her
good
looks
it
that
daughter
who
to
blame
did
you
see
her
new
white
spats
right
away
the
minute
they
come
out
she
has
to
have
i
only
surprised
she
got
one
of
them
red
hats
from
gimp
what
is
all
the
fad
believe
me
if
not
for
such
ideas
her
mother
could
afford
something
better
as
succotash
for
us
for
supper
it
a
shame
let
me
tell
you
that
a
woman
like
kaufman
ca
see
for
herself
such
things
god
forbid
i
should
ever
be
so
blind
to
my
irving
i
tell
you
that
ruby
has
got
it
more
like
a
queen
than
a
daughter
spats
yet
rich
girls
could
be
glad
to
have
it
always
so
good
i
do
say
nothing
how
her
mother
treats
vetsburg
her
oldest
boarder
and
for
what
he
pays
for
that
second
floor
front
and
no
lunches
she
can
afford
to
cater
a
little
but
that
such
a
girl
should
be
made
to
take
up
a
little
stenography
or
help
with
the
housework
when
that
girl
even
turns
a
hand
pale
like
a
ghost
her
mother
gets
how
girls
are
raised
nowadays
even
the
poor
ones
i
ai
the
one
to
complain
katz
but
just
look
down
there
that
red
stuff
where
ai
it
cranberry
between
ruby
and
vetsburg
yes
yes
and
look
such
a
dish
of
it
is
it
right
extras
should
be
allowed
to
be
brought
on
a
table
like
this
where
fourteen
other
boarders
got
to
let
their
mouth
water
and
look
at
it
you
think
it
do
hurt
like
a
knife
for
myself
i
do
mind
but
my
irving
how
that
child
loves
and
he
should
got
to
sit
at
the
same
table
without
cranberries
from
the
head
of
the
table
the
flashing
implements
of
carving
held
in
askance
for
stroke
her
lips
lifted
to
a
smile
and
a
simulation
of
interest
for
display
of
further
carnivorous
appetites
kaufman
passed
her
nod
from
one
to
the
other
miss
arndt
little
more
no
krakower
gravy
suss
suss
so
simon
schloss
miss
horowitz
vetsburg
let
me
give
you
this
little
tender
no
then
ruby
here
let
mama
give
you
just
a
little
more
no
no
mama
please
she
caught
at
the
hovering
wrist
to
spare
the
descent
of
the
knife
by
one
of
those
rare
atavisms
by
which
a
poet
can
be
bred
of
a
peasant
or
peasant
be
begot
of
poet
miss
ruby
kaufman
who
was
born
in
newark
posthumous
to
a
terrified
little
parent
with
a
black
ribbon
at
the
throat
of
her
gown
had
brought
with
her
from
no
telling
where
the
sultry
eyes
and
skin
of
winds
the
corpuscles
of
a
shah
might
have
been
running
in
the
blood
of
her
yet
simon
kaufman
and
simon
kaufman
father
before
him
had
sold
wool
remnants
to
on
commission
ruby
you
do
eat
enough
to
keep
a
bird
alive
ai
it
a
shame
vetsburg
a
girl
should
be
so
dainty
meyer
vetsburg
cast
a
beetling
glance
down
upon
miss
kaufman
there
so
small
beside
him
and
tinked
peremptorily
against
her
plate
three
times
with
his
fork
eat
young
lady
like
your
mama
wants
you
should
or
by
golly
i
string
you
up
for
my
not
mrs
kaufman
a
smile
lay
under
vetsburg
mustache
gray
were
his
eyes
too
and
his
suit
a
comfortable
baggy
suit
with
the
slouch
of
the
wearer
impressed
into
it
the
coat
hiking
center
back
the
half
in
half
out
and
the
knees
sagging
out
of
press
that
right
vetsburg
you
should
scold
her
when
she
do
eat
above
the
basque
so
pleasantly
relieved
at
the
throat
by
a
v
of
fresh
white
net
a
wave
of
color
moved
up
kaufman
face
into
her
architectural
coiffure
the
very
black
and
very
coarse
skein
of
her
hair
wound
into
a
large
loose
mound
directly
atop
her
head
and
pierced
there
with
a
comb
of
another
decade
i
always
say
vetsburg
she
minds
you
before
she
minds
anybody
else
in
the
world
ma
said
miss
kaufman
close
upon
that
remark
some
succotash
please
from
her
vantage
katz
leaned
a
bit
forward
from
the
line
look
finshriber
how
for
a
woman
her
age
she
snaps
her
black
eyes
at
him
it
ai
hard
to
guess
when
a
woman
got
a
marriageable
daughter
not
you
can
take
it
from
me
she
get
him
for
her
ruby
yet
and
take
it
from
me
too
almost
any
girl
i
know
much
less
ruby
kaufman
could
do
worse
as
get
meyer
vetsburg
i
wish
it
to
her
to
get
him
for
why
once
in
a
while
should
a
poor
girl
get
a
rich
man
except
in
books
and
choruses
believe
me
a
girl
like
ruby
can
manage
what
she
wants
take
it
from
me
she
got
it
behind
her
ears
i
should
say
so
without
it
she
could
get
in
with
such
a
crowd
of
rich
girls
like
she
does
i
got
it
from
abrams
in
the
arline
apartments
how
every
week
she
plays
five
hundred
with
nathan
shapiro
daughter
no
shapiro
stein
and
yesterday
at
matinée
in
she
comes
with
a
box
of
candy
and
laughing
with
that
rifkin
girl
how
she
gets
in
with
such
swell
girls
i
do
know
but
there
ai
a
nice
saturday
afternoon
i
do
see
that
girl
walking
on
fifth
avenue
with
just
such
a
crowd
of
girls
all
with
their
noses
powdered
so
white
and
their
hats
so
little
and
stylish
i
would
be
surprised
if
her
mother
do
send
her
down
to
atlantic
city
over
easter
again
if
vetsburg
goes
every
holiday
she
has
to
go
lately
like
it
was
coming
to
her
say
between
you
and
me
i
do
put
it
past
her
it
that
markovitch
boy
down
there
she
after
ray
klein
saw
on
the
boardwalk
once
together
and
she
says
it
a
shame
for
the
people
how
they
sat
so
close
in
a
i
would
be
surprised
she
fresh
with
the
boys
but
believe
me
if
she
gets
the
uncle
she
do
take
the
nephew
say
a
clerk
in
his
own
father
hotel
like
the
markovitches
got
in
atlantic
city
ai
no
crime
her
mother
has
got
bigger
thoughts
for
her
than
that
for
why
i
guess
she
thinks
her
daughter
should
take
the
nephew
when
maybe
she
can
get
the
uncle
herself
nowadays
it
ai
nothing
no
more
that
girls
marry
twice
their
own
age
i
always
say
i
can
tell
when
leo
markovitch
comes
down
by
the
way
her
mother
face
gets
long
and
the
daughter
gets
short
can
you
blame
her
leo
markovitch
with
all
his
monograms
on
his
and
such
black
rims
on
his
glasses
ai
the
rosenthal
vetsburg
hosiery
company
not
by
a
long
shot
there
ai
a
store
in
this
town
you
ask
for
the
no
hole
guaranteed
stocking
right
away

show
it
to
you
just
for
fun
always
i
ask
cornstarch
pudding
irving

making
that
noise
at
kaufman
little
boys

be
seen
and
not

cornstarch
pudding

katz
how
kaufman
knows
how
i
hate

little
something

you
that
extra
piece
cake
just
so
much
board

pay
as
flora
proskauer
the
line
about
the
table
broke
suddenly
attended
with
a
scraping
of
chairs
and
chirrupings
attended
with
toothpicks
a
blowsy
maid
strained
herself
immediately
across
the
strewn
table
and
cloying
lamb
platter
and
turned
off
two
of
the
three
gas
jets
in
the
yellow
gloom
the
odors
of
food
permeating
it
they
filed
out
and
up
the
dim
lit
stairs
into
halls
the
line
of
conversation
and
short
laughter
drifting
after
a
door
slammed
then
another
irving
katz
leaped
from
his
third
floor
threshold
to
the
front
hearth
quaking
three
layers
of
chandeliers
from
morris
krakower
fourth
floor
back
the
tune
of
a
flute
began
to
wind
down
the
stairs
out
of
her
door
finshriber
poked
a
frizzled
gray
head
mrs
at
the
door
of
the
first
floor
back
kaufman
paused
with
her
hand
on
the
knob

opened
the
door
entering
cautiously
let
me
light
up
mrs
kaufman
he
struck
a
phosphorescent
line
on
the
sole
of
his
shoe
turning
up
three
jets
you
must
excuse
vetsburg
how
this
room
looks
all
day

caught
up
a
litter
of
dainty
pink
frills
in

making
clearing
a
chair
for
him

down
mr
vetsburg
they
adjusted
themselves
around
the
shower
of
gaslight
miss
kaufman
fumbling
in
her
flowered
finally
curling
her
foot
up
under
her
her
needle
flashing
and
shirring
through
one
of
the
pink
flounces
ruby
in
such
a
light
you
should
strain
your
eyes
all
right

stitching
placidly
on
what
you
give
me
ruby
if
i
tell
you
whose
favorite
color

pink
aw
vetsy
she
cried
her
face
like
a
rose
color
pink
from
the
depths
of
an
inverted
top
kaufman
fished
out
another
bit
of
the
pink
ruffling
it
with
deft
needle
the
flute
lifted
its
plaintive
voice
feeling
for
high
vetsburg
lighted
a
loosely
wrapped
cigar
and
slumped
in
his
chair
if
anybody
he
observed
should
ask
right
this
minute
where

at

for
me
kaufman

he
sat
regarding
her
puffing
and
chewing
his
live
cigar
suddenly
he
leaped
forward
his
hand
closing
rigidly
over
hers

with
she
resumed
her
work
with
a
smile
and
a
twitching
at
her
lips
that
she
was
unable
to
control
a
warm
flow
of
air
came
in
puffing
the
lace
curtains
a
faint
odor
of
departed
splendor
lay
in
that
room
its
high
calcimined
ceiling
with
the
floral
rosette
in
the
center
the
tarnished
tilted
to
reflect
a
great
pair
of
walnut
which
cut
off
the
room
where
once
it
had
flowed
on
to
join
the
great
length
of
parlor

with
an
inlay
of
mirror
and
a
collapsible
desk
arrangement
backed
up
against

divan
with
a
winding
back
and
sleek
with
horsehair

drawn
across
a
corner
a
bureau
alongside
a
bronze
clock
ticked
roundly
from
the
mantel
balanced
at
either
side
by
a
pair
of
cornucopias
with
warts
blown
into
them
kaufman
let
her
hands
drop
idly
in
her
lap
and
her
head
fell
back
against
the
chair
in
repose
the
lines
of
her
mouth
turned
up
and
her
throat
where
so
often
the
years
eat
in
first
was
smooth
and
even
slender
above
the
rather
round
swell
of

and
a
flush
rushed
up
completely
dyeing
her

lines
radiating
from

their
expressions
across

in
a
smile

to
go
without
a

frills
for
their
easter
dinner
ruby
i

the
old
i
just
sat
and
looked
at
them
there
at

i
said
to
think
they
drown
kittens
and
let
those
poor
lumps
live
ruby
are
you
ashamed
to
talk
like
that
sat
there
and
looked
at
poor
old
man
katz
with
his
ear
all
ragged
like
it
had
been
chewed
off
and
wondered
why
he
did
just
go
down
to
brooklyn
bridge
for
a
high
jump
ruby
i
if
all
those
big
strapping
women
suss
and
finshriber
and
the
whole
gang
of
them
were
anything
but
vegetables
they
get
out
and
hustle
with
keeping
house
to
work
some
of
their
flabbiness
off
and
give
us
a
chance
to
get
somebody
in
besides
a
crowd
of
useless
women
who
think
mommy
you
a
dumbwaiter
chambermaid
lady
maid
and
french
chef
rolled
in
one
honest
ma
if
you
carry
that
up
to
katz
on
the
sly
with
that
big
son
of
hers
to
come
down
and
get
it
i
i
go
right
up
and
tell
her
what
i
think
of
her
if
she
leaves
vetsburg
you
you
must
listen
to
her
ca
take
a
day
off
for
a
rest
at
atlantic
city
because
their
old
easter
dinner
might
go
down
the
wrong
side
honest
mama
to
to
think
how
letting
a
crowd
of
old
flabby
women
that
are
fit
even
to
wipe
your
shoes
make
a
regular
servant
out
of
you
mommy
there
were
tears
in
miss
kaufman
voice
actual
tears
big
and
bright
in
her
eyes
and
two
spots
of
color
had
popped
out
in
her
cheeks
ruby
when
when
a
woman
like
me
makes
her
living
off
her
boarders
she
ca
afford
to
be
so
particular
you
think
it
a
pleasure
i
ca
slam
the
door
right
in
katz
face
when
six
times
a
day
she
orders
towels
and
you
think
it
a
pleasure
i
got
to
take
sass
from
such
a
bad
boy
like
irving
i
tell
you
ruby
it
easy
talk
from
a
girl
that
understand
you
you
make
me
ashamed
before
vetsburg
you
should
run
down
to
the
people
we
make
our
living
off
of
miss
kaufman
flashed
her
vivid
face
toward
vetsburg
still
low
there
in
his
chair
she
was
trembling
vetsy
knows
he
the
only
one
in
this
house
does
know
he
been
here
with
us
ten
years
ever
since
we
started
in
this
big
house
not
not
to
know
he
the
only
one
thinks
you
here
for
anything
except
impudence
and
running
stairs
and
standing
sass
from
the
bad
boys
of
lazy
mothers
you
know
do
you
vetsy
ruby
vetsburg
you
you
must
excuse
from
the
depths
of
his
chair
vetsburg
voice
came
slow
and
carefully
weighed
my
only
complaint
kaufman
with
what
ruby
has
got
to
say
is
it
ai
strong
enough
it
maybe
ai
none
of
my
business
but
always
i
have
told
you
that
for
your
own
good
you
too
no
wonder
every
boarder
what
you
got
stays
year
in
and
year
out
till
even
the
biggest
kickers
pay
more
board
sooner
as
go
in
my
business
kaufman
it
the
same
right
away
if
i
get
too
easy
with
but
vetsburg
a
poor
woman
ca
afford
to
be
so
independent
i
got
big
expenses
and
big
rent
i
got
a
daughter
to
raise
mama
have
i
begged
you
a
hundred
times
to
let
me
take
up
stenography
and
get
out
and
hustle
so
you
can
take
it
easy
have
i
a
thick
coating
of
tears
sprang
to
kaufman
eyes
and
muddled
the
gaze
she
turned
toward
vetsburg
is
it
natural
vetsburg
a
mother
should
want
her
only
child
should
have
always
the
best
and
do
always
the
things
she
never
herself
could
afford
to
do
all
my
life
vetsburg
i
had
always
to
work
even
when
i
was
five
months
married
to
a
man
what
it
looked
like
would
some
day
do
big
things
in
the
wool
business
i
was
left
all
of
a
sudden
with
nothing
but
debts
and
my
baby
but
mama
is
it
natural
vetsburg
i
should
want
to
work
off
my
hands
my
daughter
should
escape
that
nothing
vetsburg
gives
me
so
much
pleasure
she
should
go
with
all
those
rich
girls
who
like
her
well
enough
poor
to
be
friends
with
her
always
when
you
take
her
down
to
atlantic
city
on
holidays
where
she
can
meet
it
it
but
mommy
is
it
any
fun
for
a
girl
to
keep
taking
trips
like
that
with
with
her
mother
always
at
home
like
a
servant
what
do
people
think
every
holiday

fallen
and
dried
on
kaufman
cheeks
she
wavered
between
a
hysteria
of
tears
and
laughter
i
children

succumbed
to
tears
daubing
her
eyes
shamefacedly
he
rose
kindly

said
regarding

with
warm
insinuating
eyes

crinkling
an
eyelid
in
a
wink
she
did
not
return
the
glance
but
caught
her
cheeks
in
the
vise
of
her
hands
as
if
to
stem
the
too
quick
flush
now
you

quit
she
cried
flashing
her
back
upon
him
in
quick
pink
confusion
she
gets
mad
yet
he
said
his
shoulders
rising
and
falling
in
silent
laughter

said
clicking
the
door
softly
after
him
good
night
and
sleep
tight
vetsy
upon
the
click
of
that
door
kaufman
leaned
softly
forward
in
her
chair
speaking
through
a
scratch
in
her
throat
ruby
with
her
flush
still
high

danced
over
toward

kaufman
scooping
the
small
form
to
her
bosom
and
relaxing
mama

girl
that
minds
they
fell
quiet
cheek
to
cheek
staring
ahead
into
the
gaslit
quiet
the
clock
ticking
into
it
the
tears
had
dried
on
kaufman
cheeks
only
her
throat
continuing
to
throb
and
her
hand
at
regular
intervals
patting
the
young
shoulder
pressed
to
her
it
was
as
if
her
heart
lay
suddenly
very
still
in
her
breast
mama

girl
that

it
it
late

down
the
bed

mad

to
see
her
no
no
mama
move
dearie
let
me
pull
down
the
bed
there
you
are
now
with
a
wrench
kaufman
threw
off
her
recurring
inclination
to
tears
moving
casually
through
the
processes
of
their
retirement
baby
i
tighten
the
buttons
on
them
new
spats
how
pretty
they
look
yes

turn
out

lights

you
in
her
white
slip
of
a
nightdress
her
coronet
braids
unwound
and
falling
down
each
shoulder
even
her
slightness
had
waned
she
was
like
juliet
who
at
fourteen
had
eyes
of
maid
and
martyr
they
crept
into
bed
grateful
for
darkness
the
flute
had
died
out
leaving
a
silence
that
was
plaintive
you
all
right
baby
yes
ma
and
she
snuggled
down
into
the
curve
of
her
mother
arm
are
you
mommy
yes
baby
go
to
sleep
then
good
night
baby
good
night
mommy
silence
lying
there
with
her
face
upturned
and
her
eyes
closed
a
stream
of
quiet
tears
found
their
way
from
under
miss
kaufman
closed
lids
running
down
and
toward
her
ears
like
spectacle
frames
an
hour
ticked
past
and
two
damp
pools
had
formed
on
her
pillow
asleep
yet
baby
almost
ma
are
you
all
right
fine
you
you
ai
mad
at
mama
not
dearie
i
thought
it
sounded
like
you
was
crying
why
mommy
not
turn
over
now
and
go
to
sleep
another
hour
and
suddenly
kaufman
shot
out
her
arm
from
the
coverlet
jerking
back
the
sheet
and
feeling
for
her
daughter
dewy
upturned
face
where
the
tears
were
slashing
down
it
baby
mommy
you
you
must
oh
my
darling
like
i
did
suspicion
it
it
only
you
got
ruby
the
meanest
mama
in
the
world
but
you
think
darling
i
got
one
minute
happiness
like
this
i
all
right
mommy
only
i
been
laying
here
half
the
night
ruby
thinking
how
i
a
bad
mother
what
thinks
only
of
her
own
no
no
mommy
turn
over
and
go
to
sl
my
daughter
falls
in
love
with
a
fine
upright
young
man
like
leo
markovitch
and
i
ai
satisfied
yet
suppose
maybe
for
two
or
three
years
you
ai
so
much
on
your
feet
suppose
even
his
uncle
meyer
do
take
him
in
do
any
young
man
got
to
get
his
start
slow
mommy
because
i
got
for
her
my
own
ideas
my
daughter
should
have
in
life
the
man
she
wants
but
mommy
if
you
think
for
one
minute
ruby
after
all
these
years
without
this
house
on
my
hands
and
my
boarders
and
their
kicks
a
woman
like
me
would
be
satisfied
why
the
more
baby
i
think
of
such
a
thing
the
more
i
see
it
for
myself
what
you
think
ruby
i
do
all
day
without
steps
to
run
and
my
gedinks
with
housekeeping
and
marketing
after
eighteen
years
of
it
at
first
ruby
ai
it
natural
it
should
come
like
a
shock
that
you
and
that
rascal
leo
got
all
of
a
sudden
so
so
thick
i
it
ai
no
more
baby
i
i
feel
fine
about
it
oh
mommy
if
if
i
thought
you
did
i
do
why
not
a
fine
young
man
what
my
girl
is
in
love
with
every
mother
should
have
it
so
mommy
you
mean
it
i
tell
you
i
feel
fine
you
do
need
to
feel
bad
or
cry
another
minute
i
can
tell
you
i
feel
happy
at
atlantic
city
if
such
a
rascal
do
tell
me
for
himself
i
i
ask
him
right
out
ma
for
why
yet
he
should
wait
till
he
got
better
prospects
so
his
can
hang
on
i
guess
not
mommy
darling
if
you
only
truly
feel
like
that
about
it
why
you
can
keep
putting
off
the
lease
ma
if
it
only
for
six
months
and
then
we
we
all
be
to
of
course
baby
mama

of
course
he
i
just
ca
begin
to
tell
you
ma
the
kind
of
a
fellow
leo
is
till

him
better
mommy

always
vetsburg

a
one
that
just
what
he
is
ma
he
just
a
prince
if
if
there
ever
was
one
one
little
prince
of
a
fellow
she
fell
to
crying
softly
easy
tears
that
flowed
freely
i
i
can
tell
you
baby
i
happy
as
you
mommy
dear
kiss
me
they
talked
huddled
arm
in
arm
until
dawn
flowed
in
at
the
window
and
dirty
roofs
began
to
show
against
a
clean
sky
footsteps
began
to
clatter
through
the
asphalt
court
and
there
came
the
rattle
of
i
wonder
if
annie
left
out
the
note
for
suss
extra
milk

dear
let
me
go
lay
right
where
you

i
guess
you
want
you
should
look
all
worn
out
when
a
certain
young
man
what
i
know
walks
down
to
meet
our
train
at
atlantic
city
this
afternoon
eh
oh
mommy
mommy
and
ruby
lay
back
against
the
luxury
of
pillows
at
eleven
the
morning
rose
to
its
climax
the
butcher
the
baker
and
every
sort
of
maker
hustling
in
and
out
the
basementway
the
sweeping
of
upstairs
halls
windows
flung
open
and
lace
curtains
looped
high
the
smell
of
spring
pouring
in
even
from
asphalt
sounds
of
scrubbing
from
various
stoops
shouts
of
drivers
from
a
narrow
street
wedged
with
its
blockade
of
delivery
wagons
and
a
crosstown
line
of
tops
back
and
nosing
for
the
speedway
of
upper
broadway
a
homely
bouquet
of
odors
rose
from
the
basement
kitchen
drifting
up
through
the
halls
the
smell
of
mutton
bubbling
as
it
stewed
after
a
morning
of
and
and
in
and
out
of
chambers
kaufman
enveloped
in
a
apron
still
angular
with
starch
hung
up
the
telephone
receiver
in
the
hall
just
beneath
the
staircase
and
entered
her
bedroom
sitting
down
rather
heavily
beside
the
open
shelf
of
her
desk
a
long
envelope
lay
uppermost
on
that
desk
and
she
took
it
up
slowly
blinking
her
eyes
shut
and
holding
them
squeezed
tight
as
if
she
would
press
back
a
vision
even
then
a
tear
oozing
through
she
blinked
it
back
but
her
mouth
was
wry
with
the
taste
of
tears
a
slatternly
maid
poked
her
head
in
through
the
open
door
katz
broke
mug
take
the
one
off
krakow
and
give
it
to
her
tillie
she
was
crying
now
frankly
and
when
the
door
swung
closed
even
though
it
swung
back
again
on
its
insufficient
hinge
she
let
her
head
fall
forward
into
the
pillow
of
her
arms
the
curve
of
her
back
rising
and
falling
but
after
a
while
the
greengrocer
came
on
his
monthly
mission
in
his
white
apron
and
and
she
compared
stubs
with
him
from
a
file
on
her
desk
and
balanced
her
account
with
careful
squinted
glance
and
a
keen
eye
for
an
overcharge
on
a
cut
of
breakfast
bacon
on
the
very
heels
of
him
so
that
they
met
and
danced
to
pass
each
other
in
the
doorway
vetsburg
entered
with
an
overcoat
flung
across
his
right
arm
and
his
left
sagging
to
a
small
black
well
he
said
standing
in
the
frame
of
the
open
door
his
derby
well
back
on
his
head
and
regarding
her
there
beside
the
small
desk
is
this
what
you
call
ready
at
twelve
she
rose
and
moved
forward
in
her
crackly
starched
apron
i
please
vetsburg
it
ai
right
i
know
you
do
mean
you
not
going
he
exclaimed
the
lifted
quality
immediately

from
his
voice

the
floor

kaufman

of
my
business
but
ai
it

the
tree

that
child
wo

so
surprised
her
mother
changes
her
mind
just
so
changeable
as
her
mother
and
more
is
ruby

it
hard
to

ever
count
on
a
little
like

took
up
her
hat
a
small
turban
of
breast
feathers
laid
out
on
the
table
beside

it
clumsily
enough
come

said

by
the
shore

ever
count
on
such
a
little
as

little
shyster

many
weeks
with
this
lease

a
shame

how
in
the
back
of
my
head
had
it
to
take
maybe
a
smaller
place
when
this
lease
was
done
but
like
i
say
talk
is
cheap
and
moving
ai
so
easy
done
ai
it
if
he
puts
in
new
plumbing
in
the
pantry
and
new
hinges
on
the
doors
and
papers
my
second
floor
and
suss
alcove
like
i
said

night
after

i
could
do
worse
as

five
year
ai
it
mr
vetsburg
i
a
house
what
keeps
filled
so
easy
and
such
a
location
with
the
subway
less
as
two
blocks
i
so
you
see
vetsburg
if
i
do
want
i
come
back
and
find
my
house
on
the
market
maybe
rented
over
my
head
i
got
to
stay
home
for
shulif
when
he
comes
a
rush
of
dark
blood
had
surged
up
into
vetsburg
face
and
he
twiddled
his
hat
his
dry
fingers
moving
around
inside
the
brim
kaufman
he
cried
kaufman
sometimes
when
for
years
a
man
do
speak
out
his
mind
sometimes
he
busts
all
of
a
sudden
right
out
i
oh
and
immediately
and
thickly
inarticulate
made
a
tremendous
feint
at
clearing
his
throat
tossed
up
his
hat
and
caught
it
rolled
his
eyes
mr
vetsburg
a
man
kaufman

bust

was
still
violently
dark
but
swallowing
with
less
labor

finest
woman
in
the
world
and
i
can
prove
it
a
woman

her
heart
and
my
heart
and
should
such
a
woman
not
come
to
atlantic
city
when
i
got
everything
fixed
like
a
stage
set
she
threw
out
an
arm
that
was
visibly
trembling
vetsburg
for
sake

how

of
a
lease

leased
to
you
for
always
the
rest
of
your
life
she
could
not
follow
him
down
the
vista
of
fancy
but
stood
interrogating
him
with
her
heartbeats
at
her
throat
vetsburg
if
he
puts
on
the
doors
and
hinges
and
new
plumbing
in
i
a
plain
man
kaufman
without
much
to
offer
a
woman
what
can
give
out
her
heart
blood
like
it
was
so
much
water
but
all
these
years
i
been
waiting
kaufman
to
bust
out
until
till
things
got
riper
i
know
with
a
woman
like
you
whose
own
happiness
always
is
last
that
first
your
girl
must
be
fixed
she
a
young
girl
vetsburg
you
you
must
depend
if
i
had
my
say
he
a
fine
fellow
kaufman
with
his
uncle
to
help
they
got
let
me
tell
you
a
better
start
as
most
young
ones
she
rose
holding
on
to
the
desk
i
i
she
said
what
lena
he
uttered
very
softly
lena
mr
vetsburg
it
been
easy
lenie
these
years
while
she
was
only
growing
up
to
keep
off
my
lips
that
name
a
name
just
like
a
leaf
off
a
rose
lena
he
reiterated
and
advanced
comprehension
came
quietly
and
dawning
like
a
morning
i
i
vetsburg
you
must
excuse
me
she
said
and
sat
down
suddenly
he
crossed
to
the
little
desk
and
bent
low
over
her
chair
his
hand
not
on
her
shoulder
but
at
the
knob
of
her
chair
his
voice
had
a
swift
rehearsed
quality
maybe
if
you
did
back
out
it
would
sound
finer
by
the
ocean
lenie
but
it
do
need
the
ocean
a
man
should
tell
a
woman
when
she
the
first
and
the
finest
woman
in
the
world
does
it
lenie
i
i
thought
ruby
she
he
a
good
boy
leo
is
lenie
a
good
boy
what
can
be
good
to
a
woman
like
his
father
before
him
good
enough
even
for
a
fine
girl
like
our
ruby
lenie
ruby

a
start
like

herself
with
the
man

she
chooses

it
i
should
tell
you
she
said
turning
around
in
her
chair
to
face
him
you
all
along
you
been
fixing
he
turned
sheepish
ai
it
fair
lenie
in
love
and
war
and
business
a
man
has
got
to
scheme
for
what
he
wants
out
of
life
long
enough
it
took
she
should
grow
up
i
knew
all
along
once
those
two
each
so
full
of
life
and
being
young
got
together
it
was
natural
what
should
happen
kaufman
lenie
lenie
prom
two
flights
up
in
through
the
open
door
and
well
above
the
harsh
sound
of
scrubbing
a
voice
curled
down
through
the
hallways
and
in
kaufman
lenie
he
said
his
singing
tingling
fingers
closing
over
her
wrist
pl
with
her
free
arm
she
reached
and
slammed
the
door
let
her
cheek
lie
to
the
back
of
his
hand
and
closed
her
eyes
iv
hers
to
reason
why
in
the
third
winter
of
a
with
europe
guzzling
blood
and
wild
with
the
taste
of
it
america
grew
flatulent
stenching
winds
from
the
blowing
her
prosperity
granaries
filled
to
bursting

in
value
and
in
congested
districts

with

rioted
when

advanced

three

millions
of

for

of

millions
of

for

of

country
feeding
into
the
insatiable
maw
of
war
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
pouring
into
coffers
bombarded
by
guns
of
its
own
manufacture
quelling
the
wound
with
a
finger
and
widening
it
with
a
knife
up
the
cuff

with
blue
faces
and
too
often
with
the
pulling

bitter
tasks
of

of

and

earthquaked

wave

drunk
with
wealth
in
new
york
where
so
many
great
forces
of
a
great
country
coagulate
the
face
of
the
city
photographed
would
have
been
a
composite
of
fat
and
jowl
rouge
and
heavy
lip
satiated
yet
insatiate
the
head
and
even
a
little
loggy
with
too
many
satisfactions
but
that
is
the
new
york
of
the
saturnite
and
of
teufelsdröckh
alone
with
his
stars
upon
blutch
connors
gazing
out
upon
the
tide
of
west
street
life
lay
lightly
and
as
unrelated
as
if
ravage
and
carnage
and
the
smell
of
still
warm
blood
were
of
another
planet
a
shower
of
white
light
from
an
incandescent
sign
opposite
threw
a
pallid
reflection
upon
connors
it
spun
the
fuzz
of
frizz
rising
off
her
blond
coiffure
into
a
sort
of
golden
fog
and
picked
out
the
sequins
of
her
bodice
the
descends
glitteringly
upon
west
street
its
solid
rows
of
long
lanky
hotels
actors
clubs
and
adding
each
its
from
her
brace
of
windows
in
the
hotel
metropolis
the
street
was
not
unlike
a
gully
cut
through
mica
a
honking
tributary
flowing
into
the
great
sea
of
broadway
a
low
car
shaped
like
an
ellipse
cut
through
the
snarl
of
traffic
bleating
a
woman
wrapped
in
a
greatcoat
of
baby
pelts
and
an
almost
undistinguishable
dog
in
the
cove
of
her
arm
walked
out
from
the
hotel
metropolis
across
the
sidewalk
and
into
a
taxicab
an
army
of
derby
hats
lowered
slightly
into
the
wind
moved
through
the
white
kind
of
darkness
standing
there
buffeting
her
pink
nails
across
her
pink
palms
connors
followed
the
westward
trend
of
that
army
out
from
it
a
face
lying
suddenly
back
flashed
up
at
her
a
mere
petal
riding
a
swift
current
but
at
sight
of
it
blutch
connors
inclined
her
entire
body
pressing
a
smile
and
a
hand
against
the
cold
pane
then
turned
inward
flashing
on
an
electrolier
a
bronze
nydia
holding
out
a
cluster
of
frosted
bulbs
a
great
deal
of
the
strong
breath
of
a
popular
perfume
and
a
great
deal
of
artificial
heat
lay
sweet
upon
that
room
as
if
many
flowers
had
lived
and
died
in
the
same
air
leaving
insidious
but
slightly
stale
memories
the
hotel
suite
has
become
the
brocaded
tomb
of
the
garden
the
kitchen
has
shrunk
into
the
and
all
the
dear
old
concoctions
that
mother
used
to
try
to
make
now
come
tinned
condensed
and
predigested
in
varieties
even
the
threshold
survives
only
in
the
booklets
of
promoters
of
suburban

estate
in

york
the
spouse
arrives
on
the
vertical
shunted
out
at
whatever
his
layer
yet
when
connors
opened
the
door
of
her
her
spirit
rose
with
the
soughing
rise
of
the
elevator
and
romance
hardy
fellow
showed
himself
within
a
murky
hotel
corridor
honeybunch
babe
said
blutch
connors
upon
the
slam
of
the
lift
door
and
there
in
the
halls
with
its
rows
of
closed
doors
in
witness
thereof
they
embraced
these
two
despising
as
flaubert
despised
to
live
in
the
reality
of
things
my
boy
cheeks
all
cold
my
girl
cheeks
all
warm
and
full
of
some
danged
good
cologne
said
connors
closing
the
door
of
their
rooms
upon
them
pressing
her
head
back
against
the
support
of
his
arm
and
kissing
her
throat
as
the
chin
flew
up
he
pressed
a
button
and
the
room
sprang
into
more
light
coming
out
pinkly
and
vividly
the
brocaded
walls
pliant
to
touch
with
every
so
often
a
engraving
a
gilt
table
with
an
onyx
top
cheerfully
cluttered
with
the
sauciest
magazines
of
the
month
a
white
mantelpiece
with
an
artificial
hearth
and
a
piled
high
with
small
lacy
pillows
and
a
very
green
magazine
open
and
face
downward
on
the
floor
beside
it
comin
better
honeybunch
i
dunno
babe
the
town
mad
with
money
but
i
do
feel
myself
going
crazy
with
any
of
it
what
ud
you
bring
us
honey
he
slid
out
of
his
greatcoat
placing
his
brown
derby
atop
three
guesses
babe
he
said
rubbing
his
cold
hands
in
a
dry
wash
and
smiling
from
five
feet
eleven
of
sartorial
accomplishment
down
upon
her
honey
darlin
said
connors
standing
erect
and
placing
her
cheek
against
the
third
button
of
his
waistcoat
wow
how
i
love
the
woman
he
cried
closing
his
hands
softly
about
her
throat
and
tilting
her
head
backward
again
darlin
you
hurt
ca
help
it
when
connors
moved
he
gave
off
the
scent
of
pomade
freely
his
slightly
thinning
brown
hair
and
the
pointy
tips
to
a
reddish
mustache
lay
sleek
with
it
there
was
the
merest
suggestion
of
to
the
waistcoat
but
not
so
that
when
he
dropped
his
eyes
the
blunt
toes
of
his
russet
shoes
were
not
in
evidence
his
suit
was
pressed
to
a
and
his
brocaded
cravat
folded
to
a
nicety
there
was
an
air
of
complete
about
him
men
can
acquire
that
sort
of
eupeptic
in
a
turkish
bath
young
mothers
and
have
it
naturally
suddenly
connors
began
to
foray
into
his
pockets
plunging
her
hand
into
the
right
the
left
then
stopped
suddenly
her
little
face
flashing
up
at
him
it
round
and
furry
my
honeybunch
brought
me
a
peach
pink
peach
in
december
nine
million
dollars
my

a
forced
blush
and
bit
small
white
teeth
immediately
into
it
sitting
on
the

sucking
inward

babe
an
hour
she
sat
there
alone
on
the
staring
into
space
and
smiling
at
what
she
saw
there
finally
she
dropped
back
into
the
lacy
mound
of
pillows
almost
instantly
asleep
but
still
smiling
at
four
that
hour
before
dawn
cracks
even
the
west
forties
where
night
is
too
often
cacophonous
with
the
sound
of
revelry
drop
into
long
narrow
aisles
of
gloom
thin
houses
with
drawn
shades
recede
into
the
mist
of
morning
and
as
through
quagmire
this
mist
hovering
close
to
ground
figures
skulk
that
nameless
shapeless
race
of
many
bloods
and
one
complexion
the
underground
complexion
of
paste
long
sour
from
standing
at
somewhat
after
that
hour
blutch
connors
made
exit
from
one
of
these
houses
noiseless
with
scarcely
a
click
after
him
and
then
without
pause
passed
down
the
brownstone
steps
and
eastward
a
taxicab
slid
by
its
honk
as
sorrowful
as
the
cry
of
a
plover
in
a
bog
another
this
one
drawing
up
alongside
in
quest
of
fare
he
moved
on
his
breath
clouding
the
early
air
and
his
hands
plunged
deep
in
his
pockets
as
if
to
plumb
their
depth
there
was
a
great
sag
to
the
silhouette
of
him
moving
thus
through
the
gloom
the
chest
in
and
the
shoulders
rounding
and
lessening
their
front
span
once
he
paused
to
remove
the
brown
derby
and
wipe
at
his
brow
a
policeman
struck
his
stick
he
moved
on
an
the
modern
sort
of
emporium
where
the
capsule
and
the
herb
have
become
side
line
to
the
ivoritus
and
the
threw
a
white
veil
of
light
across
the
sidewalk
well
past
that
window
but
as
if
its
image
had
only
just
caught
up
with
him
connors
turned
back
retracing
ten
steps
a
denuded
of
frippery
but
strewn
with
straw
and
crisscrossed
with
two
large
strips
of
poster
proclaimed
chicklet
face
powder
to
the
cosmetically
concerned
with
an
eye
to
fidelity
a
small
brood
of
small
chickens
half
dead
with
bad
air
and
not
larger
than
fists
huddled
rearward
and
out
of
the
grilling
light
puny
victims
to
an
indorsed
method
of
advertising
connors
entered
scouting
out
a
dozy
clerk
say
bo
what
one
of
them
chicks
worth
ai
fer
sale
connors
lowered
his
voice
nudging

every

i
got
in
my
pocket
keep
the
for
when
connors
emerged
a
small
chirruping
bunch
of
fuzz
cupped
in
his
hand
lay
snug
in
the
pocket
at
sixth
avenue
where
the
great
skeleton
of
the
elevated
stalks
like
a
prehistoric
he
paused
for
an
instant
in
the
shadow
of
a
gigantic
black
pillar
readjusting
the
fragile
burden
to
his
pocket
stepping
out
to
cross
the
street
simultaneously
a
great
silent
noiseless
but
wild
with
speed
tore
down
the
tracks
blacker
in
the
hulking
shadow
of
the
elevated
trellis
a
quick
doubling
up
of
the
sagging
silhouette
and
the
groan
of
a
clutch
violently
thrown
a
woman
shriek
flying
thin
and
high
like
a
javelin
of
horror
a
crowd
sprung
full
grown
out
of
the
bog
of
the
morning
white
peering
faces
showing
up
in
the
brilliant
paths
of
the
acetylene
lamps
a
uniform
pushing
through
a
crowbar
and
the
hard
breathing
of
men
straining
to
lift
a
sob
in
the
dark
stand
back
stand
back
dawn
then
a
blue
wintry
sky
the
color
and
hardness
of
enamel
and
sunshine
bright
yet
so
far
off
the
eye
could
stare
up
to
it
unsquinting
it
lay
against
the
of
the
suite
in
the
hotel
metropolis
it
even
crept
in
like
a
timid
hand
reaching
toward
yet
not
quite
touching
the
figure
of
blutch
connors
lying
her
cheek
dug
into
the
harshness
of
the
carpet
there
at
the
closed
door
to
the
bedroom
prone
as
if
washed
there
and
her
yellow
hair
streaming
back
like
seaweed
sobs
came
but
only
the
dry
kind
that
beat
in
the
throat
and
then
come
shrilly
like
a
sheet
of
silk
swiftly
torn
how
frail
are
human
ties
have
said
the
of
every
age
in
one
epigrammatic
fashion
or
another
but
frailty
can
bleed
in
fact
it
first
to
bleed
lying
there
with
her
face
swollen
and
stamped
with
the
squirming
in
a
grief
that
was
actually
abashing
before
it
was
heartbreaking
ann
connors
whose
only
epiphany
of
life
was
love
and
shut
out
from
so
much
else
that
helps
make
life
sweet
was
now
shut
out
from
none
of
its
pain
once
she
scratched
at
the
door
a
faint
scratch
for
admission
and
then
sat
back
on
her
heels
staring
at
the
uncompromising
panel
holding
back
the
audibility
of
her
sobs
with
her
hand
silence
and
only
the
breath
of
ether
seeping
out
to
her
sweet
insidious
she
took
to
hugging
herself
violently
against
a
sudden
chill
that
rushed
over
her
rattling
her
frame
the
bedroom
door
swung
noiselessly
back
fanning
out
the
etheric
fumes
and
closed
again
upon
an
emerging
figure
doctor
quick
god
what
he
looked
down
upon
her
with
the
kind
of
glaze
over
his
eyes
that
bellini
loved
to
paint
compassion
for
the
pain
of
the
world
almost
distilled
to
tears
doctor
he
ai
my
poor
little
lady
o
god
no
no
no
no
doctor

would
please
please

doctor
he

got

god
please
and
fell
back
swooning
with
an
old
man
tear
splashing
down
as
if
to
revivify
her
the
heart
has
a
resiliency
strained
to
breaking
it
can
contract
again
even
the
waiting
women
iseult
and
penelope
learned
as
they
sat
sorrowing
and
watching
to
sing
to
the
swing
of
the
sea
when
out
of
the
slough
of
dark
weeks
connors
took
up
life
again
she
was
only
beaten
not
broken
a
reed
lashed
down
by
storm
and
then
resilient
daring
to
lift
its
head
again
a
wan
little
head
but
the
eyes
unwashed
of
their
blue
and
the
irises
grown
large
the
same
hard
sunshine
lay
in
its
path
between
the
brocade
curtains
of
a
room
strangely
denuded
it
was
as
if
spring
had
died
there
when
it
was
only
the
barren
of
its
lacy
pillows
a
glass
vase
and
picture
gone
from
the
mantel
a
mexican
afghan
removed
from
a
divan
and
showing
its
bulges
it
was
any
hotel
suite
now
uncompromising
leave
me
or
take
me
in
taking
leave
of
it
connors
looked
about
her
even
coldly
as
if
this
barren
room
were
too
denuded
of
its
memories

mighty
good
to
me
joe

good
to

was
pinning
on

little
veil
over
her
decently
black
hat
and
paused
now
to
dab
up
under
it
at
a
tear

jacket

oh

woh
woh
woh
with
her
face
flung
back
and
twisted
and
dodging
his
outflung
arm
she
was
down
four
flights
of
narrow
unused
stairs
and
out
once
in
the
streets
she
walked
with
her
face
still
thrust
up
and
a
frenzy
of
haste
in
her
stride
red
had
popped
out
in
her
cheeks
there
was
voice
in
each
breath
moans
that
her
throat
would
not
hold
that
night
she
slept
in
the
kind
of
room
the
city
offers
its
decent
poor
a
slit
of
a
room
with
a
bed
and
a
damp
mattress
a
gaunt
with
its
gaunt
mission
a
on
a
zinc
mat
a
chair
the
chair
she
propped
against
the
door
the
top
slat
of
it
beneath
the
knob
through
a
night
of
musty
blackness
she
lay
in
a
rigid
line
along
the
you
who
love
the
city
for
its
million
pulses
the
beat
of
its
great
heart
and
the
terrific
symphony
of
its
soul
have
you
ever
picked
out
from
its
orchestra
the
plaintive
rune
of
the
deserving
poor
it
is
like
the
note
of
a
wind
instrument
an
oboe
adding
its
slow
note
to
the
boom
of
the
the
clang
of
cymbals
and
the
singing
ecstasy
of
violins
one
such
small
voice
ann
connors
added
to
the
great
threnody
of
industry
department
stores
that
turned
from
her
services
almost
before
they
were
offered
offices
gleaned
from
penny
papers
miles
of
them
and
hours
of
waiting
on
chairs
in
draughty
faces
pasty
as
her
own
lined
up
alongside
greedy
of
the
morsel
about
to
fall
when
the
pinch
of
poverty
threatens
men
and
wolves
they
grow
in
these
first
lean
days
a
week
of
them
ann
face
lengthened
a
bit
too
and
with
the
fuzz
of
yellow
bangs
tucked
well
up
under
her
not
so
decent
black
hat
crinkles
came
out
about
her
eyes
nights
she
supped
in
a
café
beneath
her
room
veal
stew
and
a
glass
of
beer
she
would
sit
over
it
not
unpleasantly
muzzy
she
slept
of
nights
now
and
not
so
rigidly
then
followed
a
week
of
lesser
department
stores
as
she
worked
her
way
of
offices
tucked
dingily
behind
lithograph
and
shops
and
even
an
loft
with
a
curlers
wanted
sign
hung
out
in
what
school
does
the
great
army
of
industry
earn
its
first
experience
who
first
employs
the
untaught
hand
upon
ann
untrained
in
any
craft
it
was
as
if
the
workaday
world
turned
its
back
nettled
at
a
philistine
once
she
sat
resting
on
a
stoop
beneath
the
sign
of
a
bureau
she
read
it
but
somehow
her
mind
would
not
register
the
calves
of
her
legs
and
the
line
where
her
shoe
cut
into
her
heel
were
hurting
she
supped
in
the
café
again
the
bowl
of
veal
stew
and
two
glasses
of
beer
some
days
following
her
very
first
venture
out
into
the
morning
she
found
employment
a
small
off
sixth
avenue
just
below
street
a
mere
pocket
in
the
wall
a
machine
champing
in
its
front
while
you
wait
cents
a
hundred
she
entered
the
sign
says
wanted
a
face
peered
down
at
her
from
a
high
chair
behind
the
champing
machine
wanted
is
what
it
says
goil
i
i
ai
old
she
faltered
cut
cards
i
try
me
five
a
week
why
yes
hang
your
coat
and
hat
behind
the
sink
before
noon
a
waste
of
miscut
cards
about
her
she
cut
her
hand
slightly
fumbling
at
the
machine
and
cried
out
for
the
love
of
mike
you
want
somebody
to
kiss
it
and
make
it
well
here
a
quarter
for
your
time
with
them
you
better
get
a
job
greasin
popcorn
out
in
the
streets
the
wind
had
hauled
a
bit
it
cut
as
she
bent
into
it
with
her
additional
quarter
she
still
had
two
dollars
and
twenty
cents
and
that
afternoon
in
lower
sixth
avenue
at
the
instance
of
another
small
card
fluttering
out
in
the
wind
she
applied
as
dishwasher
in
a
and
again
obtained
this
time
at
six
dollars
a
week
and
suppers
the
jefferson
market
lunch
room
thick
with
sawdust
and
the
fumes
of
hissing
grease
was
sunk
slightly
below
the
level
of
the
sidewalk
a
fitting
retreat
for
the
humanity
that
dined
furtively
at
its
counter
men
with
too
short
and
collars
turned
up
women
with
beery
eyes
and
uneven
dank
with
the
of
life
lower
decks
lower
sixth
avenue
is
the
abode
of
these
shadows
where
are
they
from
and
whither
going
these
women
without
beauty
who
walk
the
streets
without
handkerchiefs
but
blubbering
with
too
much
or
too
little
drink
what
is
the
terrible
riddle
why
even
as
they
blubber
are
there
women
whose
bodies
have
the
quality
of
cream
slipping
in
between
scented
sheets
ann
hers
not
to
argue
but
accept
dallied
with
no
such
question
behind
the
a
sink
of
unwashed
dishes
rose
to
a
mound
she
plunged
her
hands
into
tepid
water
that
clung
to
her
like
fuzz

ann
a
wave
of
the
furry
water
slopping
out
and
down
her
followed
four
days
spent
in
the
heat
of
the
kitchen
the
smell
of
strong
foods
raw
meat
and
fish
stews
thick
above
the
sink
she
had
moved
farther
against
car
fare
but
because
she
talked
now
constantly
in
her
sleep
and
often
cried
out
there
were
knockings
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
partitions
and
oaths
for
two
evenings
she
sat
until
midnight
in
a
small
rear
café
again
pleasantly
muzzy
over
three
glasses
of
beer
and
the
thick
warmth
of
the
room
another
night
she
carried
home
a
small
bottle
tucking
it
beneath
her
coat
as
she
emerged
to
the
street
she
was
now
in
spite
of
precautions
and
her
hat
with
her
hair
uncurled
to
sustain
it
had
settled
down
over
her
ears
grotesquely
large
the
week
raced
with
her
funds
on
the
sixth
day
she
paid
out
her
last
fifty
cents
for
and
without
breakfast
filched
her
lunch
from
a
order
of
codfish
balls
returned
to
the
kitchen
yes
reader
but
who
are

to
turn
away
sickened
and

no
more
of
this

who

to
bask

but
shudder
at
its
drool
a
carpenter
did
not
sicken
at
a
leper
he
held
out
a
hand
that
night
upon
leaving
she
asked
for
a
small
advance
on
her
week
wage
retreating
before
the
furiously
stained
and
the
one
eye
of
the
proprietor
cast
down
upon

o

if

drop
your

watch
out
that
pint
wo
last
you
overnight
layoff
she
reddened
immediately
clapping
her
hand
over
the
small
protruding
bottle
in
her
pocket
she
dared
not
return
to
her
room
but
sat
out
the
night
in
a
dark
foyer
behind
a
no
one
found
her
out
and
the
wind
could
not
reach
her
toward
morning
she
even
slept
sitting
but
the
day
following
weak
and
too
soft
for
the
lift
straining
to
remove
the
great
high
with
crockery
from
sink
to
table
she
let
slip
grasping
for
a
new
hold
there
was
a
crash
and
a
splintered
debris
plates
that
rolled
like
hoops
to
the
four
corners
of
the
room
shivering
as
they
landed
a
great
ringing
explosion
of
heavy
stoneware
and
herself
drenched
with
the
webby
water
o
god
she
cried
in
immediate
hysteria
o
god
o
god
and
fell
to
her
knees
in
a
frenzy
of
a
minerva
a
waitress
with
whom
she
had
had
no
previous
word
sprang
to
her
succor
a
big
red
hand
of
mercy
jerking
her
up
from
the
debris
clear
out
he
across
the
bar
beat
it
while
the
going
good
your
week
gone
in
breakage
anyways
and
he
split
up
the
place
when
he
comes
clear
out
girl
and
here
for
car
fare
out
in
the
street
her
jacket
not
quite
on
and
her
hat
clapped
askew
ann
found
herself
quite
suddenly
scuttling
down
a
in
her
hand
a
dime
burnt
up
into
the
palm
for
the
first
time
in
these
weeks
except
when
her
pint
or
the
evening
beer
had
vivified
her
a
warmth
seemed
to
flow
through
ann
chilled
and
her
wet
clothing
clinging
in
at
the
knees
a
fever
nevertheless
quickened
her
she
was
crying
as
she
walked
but
not
blubbering
spontaneous
hot
tears
born
of
acute
consciousness
of
pain
a
great
shame
at
her
smelling
smote
her
too
and
she
stood
back
in
a
doorway
scraping
at
it
with
a
futile
forefinger
february
had
turned
soft
and
soggy
the
city
streets
running
mud
and
the
damp
insidious
enough
to
creep
through
the
warmth
of
human
flesh
a
day
threatened
with
fog
from
east
river
had
slipped
without
the
interim
of
dusk
into
a
heavy
evening
her
clothing
dried
but
sitting
in
a
small
triangle
of
park
in
grove
street
chill
seized
her
again
and
faint
for
food
but
with
nausea
for
it
she
tucked
her
now
empty
pint
bottle
beneath
the
bench
she
was
crying
incessantly
but
her
mind
still
seeming
to
revive
her
small
black
purse
she
drew
out
from
her
pocket
it
had
a
collapsed
look
yet
within
were
a
sample
of
cotton
crêpe
a
receipt
from
a
establishment
and
a
bit
of
pink
chamois
in
another
compartment
a
small
assortment
of
keys
she
fumbled
among
them
blind
with
tears
once
she
drew
out
peering
forward
toward
a
to
inspect
it
it
clinked
as
she
touched
it
a
small
metal
tag
ringing
hotel
liberty
an
hour
ann
sat
there
with
the
key
in
her
lax
hand
finally
she
rubbed
the
pink
chamois
across
her
features
and
adjusted
her
hat
pausing
to
scrape
again
with
forefinger
at
the
front
of
her
and
moved
on
through
the
gloom
the
wind
blowing
her
skirt
forward
she
boarded
a
seventh
avenue
extracting
the
piece
from
her
purse
with
a
great
show
of
sat
back
against
the
lengthwise
seat
her
red
hands
with
the
cut
forefinger
bound
in
rag
folded
over
her
waist
at
fiftieth
street
she
alighted
the
white
lights
of
the
whitest
street
in
the
world
forcing
down
through
the
murk
and
a
theater
crowd
swarming
to
be
turned
from
reality
the
incandescent
sign
of
the
hotel
liberty
jutted
out
ahead
she
did
not
pause
she
was
in
and
into
an
elevator
even
before
a
lackey
turned
to
stare
she
found
easily
enough
inserting
the
key
and
opening
the
door
upon
darkness
a
warm
darkness
that
came
flowing
out
scented
she
found
the
switch
pressed
it
a
lamp
with
a
red
shade
sprang
up
and
a
center
chandelier
a
room
hotel
chromos
well
in
evidence
but
a
air
of
solid
comfort
beyond
a
bathroom
shining
through
the
open
door
and
another
room
hinted
at
beyond
that
she
dropped
even
in
her
hat
and
jacket
against
the
divan
piled
with
satin
cushions
tears
coursed
out
from
her
closed
eyes
and
she
relaxed
as
if
she
would
swoon
to
the
luxury
of
the
pillows
burrowing
and
letting
them
bulge
up
softly
about
her
a
she
lay
so
in
the
warm
bath
of
light
her
little
body
so
quickly
fallen
into
vagrancy
not
without
litheness
beneath
the
moldy
skirt
some
time
after
eight
she
rose
letting
the
warm
water
in
the
bathroom
lave
over
her
hands
limbering
them
and
from
a
bottle
of
eau
de
cologne
in
a
small
sprinkled
herself
freely
and
touched
up
the
corners
of
her
eyes
with
it
a
thick
robe
of
turkish
toweling
hung
from
the
bathroom
door
she
unhooked
it
looping
it
over
one
arm
a
key
scraped
in
the
lock
from
where
she
stood
a
rigidity
raced
over
ann
locking
her
every
limb
in
paralysis
her
mouth
moved
to
open
and
would
not
the
handle
turned
and
with
a
sudden
release
of
faculties
darting
this
way
and
that
as
if
at
bay
she
tore
the
from
its
moorings
and
with
a
yell
sprung
somewhere
from
the
primordial
depths
of
her
stood
with
it
swung
to
hurl
the
door
opened
and
she
lunged
then
let
it
fall
weakly
and
with
a
small
crash
the
chambermaid
white
with
shock
at
that
cry
dropped
her
burden
of
towels
in
the
open
doorway
and
fled
ann
fled
too
down
the
two
flights
of
stairs
her
frenzy
found
out
for
her
and
across
the
flare
of
broadway
the
fog
from
east
river
was
blowing
in
grandly
as
she
ran
into
its
tulle
it
closed
around
and
around
her
v
golden
fleece
how
saving
a
dispensation
it
is
that
men
do
not
carry
in
their
hearts
perpetual
ache
at
the
pain
of
the
world
that
the
of
the
beating
out
frantic
strength
against
cell
doors
can
not
penetrate
the
beatitude
of
a
mother
bending
at
that
moment
above
a
crib
men
can
sit
in
club
windows
while
even
as
they
sit
are
strewn
with
youth
dying
their
faces
in
mud
while
men
are
dining
where
there
are
mahogany
and
silver
and
the
gloss
of
women
shoulders
are
men
with
on
their
shins
ice
gluing
shut
their
eyes
and
lashed
with
gale
to
some
women
at
the
opera
so
fragrant
that
the
senses
swim
sit
with
consciousness
partitioned
against
a
sweating
shuddering
woman
in
some
forbidding
forbidden
room
hacking
open
a
wall
to
conceal
something
of
the
world
does
not
know
or
care
how
the
other
half
lives
or
dies
when
one
summer
july
came
in
like
desert
wind
west
cabanne
terrace
and
that
part
of
residential
louis
that
is
set
back
in
carefully
conserved
lawns
did
not
sip
its
iced
limeades
with
any
the
less
refreshment
because
at
the
intersection
of
broadway
and
west
street
a
woman
trundling
a
bundle
of
washing
in
an
old
perambulator
suddenly
keeled
of
heat
saliva
running
from
her
at
three
that
hour
when
so
often
a
summer
day
reaches
its
stilly
climax
and
the
becomes
a
thing
visible
west
cabanne
terrace
and
its
kind
slip
into
sheerest
and
crêpiest
de
chine
click
electric
fans
to
third
speed
draw
green
shades
and
retire
for
siesta
at
that
same
hour
in
the
popular
store
where
broadway
and
west
street
intersect
one
hundred
and
fifty
salesgirls
jaded
sentinels
for
a
public
that
dares
not
venture
down
loll
at
their
counters
and
after
the
occasional
shopper
relax
deeper
to
limpidity
at
the
jewelry
counter
a
crystal
rectangle
facing
broadside
the
main
entrance
and
the
bleached
and
street
without
miss
lola
hassiebrock
salient
among
many
and
with
olympian
certainty
of
self
lifted
two
junoesque
arms
like
unto
the
handles
of
a
vase
held
them
there
in
the
kind
of
rigidity
that
accompanies
a
yawn
and
then
let
them
flop
god
bless
my
soul
she
said
miss
josie
beemis
narrowly
constricted
between
shoulders
that
barely
sloped
off
from
her
neck
with
arms
folded
flat
to
her
flat
bosom
and
her
back
a
hypothenuse
against
the
counter
looked
up
watch
out
loo
i
read
in
the
paper
where
a
man
up
in
alton
got
caught
in
the
middle
of
one
of
those
gaps
and
could
ungap
miss
hassiebrock
batted
at
her
lips
and
shuddered
it
my
nerves
dearie
all
the
doctors
say
that
nine
gaps
out
of
ten
are
nerves
miss
beemis
hugged
herself
a
bit
flatter
looking
out
straight
ahead
into
a
parasol
sale
across
the
aisle
enough
sleep
ai
such
a
bad
cure
for
gaps
she
said
i
catch
up
in
time
dearie
my
foot
been
asleep
all
day
huh
sniffling
so
that
her
thin
nose
quirked
sidewise
i
will
now
indulge
in
hollow
laughter
you
ca
dearie
said
miss
hassiebrock
driven
to
vaudevillian
extremities
you
cracked
well
i
may
be
cracked
but
my
good
name
ai
a
stiffening
of
miss
hassiebrock
took
place
as
if
mere
verbiage
had
suddenly
flung
a
fang
from
beneath
the
sternly
and
too
starched
white
shirtwaist
and
the
unwilted
linen
cravat
wound
high
about
her
throat
and
sustained
there
with
a
rhinestone
horseshoe
it
was
as
if
a
wave
of
color
had
started
deep
down
rushing
up
under
milky
flesh
into
her
hair
is
that
meant
to
be
an
remark
josie
how
it
meant
it
how
it
took
there
some
poor
simps
in
this
world
maybe
right
here
in
this
store
ought
to
be
excused
from
what
they
say
because
they
do
know
any
better
i
know
this
much
to
catch
the
north
end
from
here
i
have
to
walk
every
night
down
past
the
stag
hotel
to
do
it
at
that
miss
hassiebrock
ears
with
the
large
pearl
blobs
in
them
tingled
where
they
peeped
out
from
the
scallops
of
yellow
hair
and
she
swallowed
with
a
forward
movement
as
if
her
throat
had
constricted
i
take
the
where
i
darn
please
and
it
nobody
darn
business
sure
it
ai
only
if
a
poor
do
want
to
make
it
everybody
darn
business
she
ca
run
around
with
the
fast
rich
boys
of
this
town
and
then
get
invited
to
help
hem
the
anything
i
do
in
this
town
i
not
ashamed
to
do
in
broad
daylight
maybe
but
just
the
samey
i
notice
the
joy
rides
out
to
claxton
take
place
in
broad
daylight
i
notice
that
striking
blonde
and
charley
cox
in
the
morning
paper
was
exactly
what
call
a
affair
no
it
was
it
was
my
affair
say
if
you
think
a
girl
like
you
can
run
with
the
black
sheep
of
every
rich
family
in
town
and
make
a
noise
like
a
million
dollars
with
the
horsy
way
she
dresses
it
ai
my
grave
you
digging
maybe
if
some
of
the
girls
in
this
store
did
have
time
to
nose
so
much
they
know
why
i
can
make
them
all
look
like
they
was
caught
out
in
the
rain
and
not
pressed
the
next
morning
while
they
snooping
in
what
do
concern
them
i
snipping
snipping
over
my
last
jacket
into
this
year
cutaway
if
you
girls
had
as
much
talent
in
your
needle
as
you
got
in
your
conversation
you
might
find
yourselves
somewheres
maybe
what
you
call
is
what
lots
of
us
would
call
miss
hassiebrock
drew
herself
up
and
from
the
suzerainty
of
sheer
height
looked
down
upon
miss
beemis
there
so
brown
and
narrow
beside
the
rack
i
have
you
know
josie
beemis
that
if
every
girl
in
this
store
watched
her
step
like
me
there
be
a
darn
sight
less
trouble
in
the
world
i
know
you
do
go
beyond
the
loo
but
gee
you
you
do
swim
out
some
little
loo
knows
her
own
depth
all
righty
not
the
way
you
cuttin
up
with
charley
cox
miss
hassiebrock
lowered
her
flaming
face
to
scrutinize
a
tray
of
rhinestone
bar
pins
i
like
to
see
any
girl
in
this
store
turn
down
a
bid
with
charley
cox
i
notice
there
are
plenty
of
you
go
out
to
the
highland
dances
hoping
to
meet
even
his
imitation
the
rich
boys
that
hang
around
the
stag
and
out
to
the
highlands
do
get
girls
like
us
anywheres
i
do
need
them
to
get
me
anywhere
it
enough
when
a
fellow
takes
me
out
that
he
can
tuck
me
up
in
a
and
make
me
forget
my
give
me
a
fellow
that
smells
of
gasolene
instead
of
bay
rum
every
time
johnnies
do
mean
nothing
in
my
life
you
let
john
simeon
out
of
this
conversation
you
let
charley
cox
out
maybe
he
do
smell
like
a
cleaned
white
glove
but
john
means
something
by
me
that
good
well
since
you
so
darn
smart
josie
beemis
and
since
you
got
so
much
of
the
english
language
to
spare
i
going
to
tell
you
something
three
nights
in
succession
and
i
can
prove
it
by
the
crowd
charley
cox
has
asked
me
to
marry
him
begged
me
last
night
out
at
claxton
inn
with
jess
turner
and
all
that
bunch
along
to
let
them
roust
out
old
man

and

in
poetry
put
that
in
your
pipe
and
smoke
it
awhile
josie
it
may
soothe
your
nerve
said
miss
beemis
the
day
dwindled
died
at
west
street
where
broadway
intersects
the
red
sun
at
its
far
end
settled
redly
and
cleanly
to
sink
like
a
huge
coin
into
the
horizon
the
popular
store
emptied
itself
into
this
hot
pink
glow
scurried
for
the
open
and
oftener
than
not
the
overstuffed
rear
platform
nose
to
nose
breath
to
breath
fortunately
the
popular
store
took
its
inventory
of
yards
and
not
of
souls
such
a
that
of
the
human
hearts
which
beat
from
half
after
eight
to
six
behind
six
floors
of
counters
would
have
revealed
empty
crannies
worn
thin
in
places
with
the
grind
of
routine
the
business
of
muslin
underwear
crash
toweling
and
the
great
middle
class
of
shoppers
who
come
querulous
with
bunions
and
babies
the
homeward
ride
supper
but
usually
within
range
of
the
range
that
boils
it
the
same
smells
of
the
same
foods
the
cinematograph
or
hour
before
bed
or
if
love
comes
and
he
will
not
be
gainsaid
a
bit
of
wooing
at
the
fountain
the
but
even
he
oftener
than
not
comes
and
in
a
tie
as
if
that
matters
and
yet
somehow
it
does
leander

would
have
worn
it
flowing
then
bed
and
the
routine
of
its
unfolding
and
coaxing
the
pillow
from
beneath
the
iron
clamp
an
crashing
through
the
stuff
of
dreams
coffee
within
reach
of
the
range
another
reality
of
muslin
underwearing
crash
toweling
and
but
not
given
to
the
popular
store
emptied
itself
with
that
blessed
elasticity
of
spirit
which
unappalled
stretches
to
as
they
come
at
ninth
street
miss
lola
hassiebrock
loosed
her
arm
where
miss
beemis
had
linked
into
it
and
her
checked
suit
so
pressed
that
the
lapels
lay
entirely
flat
to
the
swell
of
her
bosom
her
red
well
down
over
her
brow
and
the
high
swathing
cravat
rising
to
inclose
her
face
like
a
wimple
she
was
fashion
apotheosis
in
mood
when
miss
hassiebrock
walked
her
skirt
concealing
yet
revealing
an
inch
glimmer
of
stocking
above
spats
allowed
her
ten
inches
of
stride
she
turned
now
sidestepping
within
those
ten
inches
see
you
josie
ai
you
taking
the
car
no
dearie
said
miss
hassiebrock
stepping
down
to
cross
the
street
you
take
it
but
not
for
keeps
and
so
walking
southward
on
ninth
street
in
a
sartorial
glory
that
was
of
her
own
from
last
season
even
louis
which
at
the
stroke
of
six
rushes
so
for
the
breeze
of
its
side
yards
leaving
darkness
to
creep
into
streets
that
are
as
deserted
as
cañons
turned
its
feminine
head
to
bear
in
mind
the
cutaway
the
male
eye
appraising
its
approval
with
bold
even
quirking
eye
through
this
and
like
diana
who
so
aloof
from
desire
walked
in
the
path
of
her
own
splendor
strode
miss
hassiebrock
straight
and
forward
of
eye
past
the
stag
hotel
in
an
aisle
formed
by
lounging
young
bloods
and
a
curb
lined
with
low
the
gaze
beneath
the
red
sailor
and
above
the
high
horsy
stock
a
bit
too
rigidly
conserved
slightly
by
the
spoken
word
and
the
whistled
innuendo
followed
her
like
a
trail
of
bubbles
in
the
wake
of
a
a
youth
still
wearing
a
fraternity
pin
pretended
to
lick
his
downy
chops
the
son
of
the
president
of
the
mound
city
oil
company
emitted
a
long
amorous
whistle
willie
waxter
youngest
scion
scalawag
and
scorcher
of
one
of
the
oldest

jammed
down
his
motorgoggles

of

the
feint
of

heavy

at

forced
her

into
the
jammed
rear
platform
the
sharp
brim
of
the
red
sailor
creating
an
area
for
her
charley
girl
wedged
there
in
the
crowd
she
looked
after
him
at
his
broad
back
receding
an
inclination
to
cry
pressed
at
her
eyeballs
flamm
avenue
which
is
treeless
and
built
up
for
its
entire
length
with
buildings
stares
window
for
window
stoop
for
stoop
at
its
opposite
side
and
in
summer
the
strip
of
asphalt
street
unshaded
and
lying
naked
to
the
sun
gives
off
such
an
effluvium
of
heat
and
hot
tar
that
the
windows
are
closed
to
it
and
night
descends
like
a
to
the
face
opening
the
door
upon
the
hassiebrock
front
room
convertible
from
to
by
the
mere
of

diagonal
cut
of
the

rocker
and
a
table
laid
out
with
knickknacks
on
a
lace
mat
slammed
closed
two
windows
and
turning
inward
lifted
off
her
hat
which
left
a
brand
across
her
forehead
and

plastered
down
her
hair
in
damp
scallops

miss
hassiebrock
strode
through
a
pair
of
chromatic
portières
with
them
swinging
after
her
and
into
an
unlit
kitchen
gray
with
dusk
a
table
drawn
out
center
and
within
range
of
the
was
a
blotch
in
the
gloom
three
figures
surrounding
it
with
arms
that
moved
vaguely
among
a
litter
of
dishes
i
wish
to
heaven
somebody
in
this
joint
would
remember
to
keep
those
front
windows

of

at

piece
rolled
from
her
clenched
and
knocking
fist
scuttling
and
settling
beneath
the
sink
she
rescued
it
and
went
out
down
the
flight
of
rear
stairs
silence
descended
over
that
kitchen
and
a
sooty
dusk
that
almost
obliterated
the
table
drawn
out
and
cluttered
after
the
manner
of
those
who
dine
frowsily
the
cold
stove
its
pots
cloying
and
a
sink
piled
high
with
a
task
whose
only
ending
is
from
meal
to
meal
finally
that
door
swung
open
again
the
silhouette
of
miss
hassiebrock
moved
swiftly
and
surely
through
the
kind
of
early
darkness
finding
out
for
itself
a
wall
telephone
hung
in
a
small
patch
of
hallway
separating
kitchen
and
front
room
her
voice
came
tight
as
if
it
were
a
tense
coil
in
her
throat
that
she
held
back
from
bursting
into
hysteria
give
me
olive
the
toe
of
her
boot
beat
a
quick
tattoo
stag
say
get
me
charley
cox
he
out
in
front
or
down
in
the
grill
or
somewhere
around
page
him
quick
important
she
grasped
the
nozzle
of
the
instrument
as
she
waited
breathing
into
it
with
her
head
thrown
back
hello

quit
your
kidding
ten
minutes
yeh
claxton
inn
slightly
outside
the
city
limits
and
certain
of
its
decorums
stands
back
in
a
grove
off
a
macadamized
highway
that
is
so
pliant
to
tire
that
of
summer
nights
with
tops
thrown
back
and
stars
sown
like
lavish
grain
over
a
close
sky
and
to
a
rushing
breeze
that
presses
the
ears
like
an
eager
whisper
wild
to
catch
up
with
the
horizon
tear
out
that
road
a
of
them
fearing
neither
penal
law
nor
dead
man
curve
slacking
only
to
be
slacked
cars
dart
off
the
road
and
up
a
gravel
driveway
that
encircles
claxton
inn
like
a
lariat
swung
then
park
themselves
among
the
trees
lights
dimmed
placid
as
a
manse
without
what
was
once
a
private
and
now
a
public
house
maintains
through
lowered
lids
its
discreet
exterior
shades
drawn
and
only
slightly
revealing
the
parting
of
lace
curtains
it
is
rearward
where
what
was
formerly
a
that
a
huge
veranda
very
whitely
lighted
juts
suddenly
out
and
a
showy
hallway
bordered
in
potted
palms
leads
off
that
here
discretion
dares
lift
her
lids
to
rove
the
gravel
drive
for
who
comes
there
in
a
car
shaped
like
a
and
as
low
to
the
ground
charley
cox
turned
in
and
with
a
great
throttling
and
choking
of
engine
drew
up
among
the
monsters
of
the
grove
and
directly
alongside
an
roadster
with
a
snout
like
a
greyhound

quench
me
no
high
jinks
though
charley
sure

they
through
the
gloom
and
finally
with
firmer
step
up
the
gravel
walk
and
into
the
porch
three
waiters
ran
toward
their
entrance
a
woman
with
a
bare
v
of
back
facing
them
and
three
plumes
that
dipped
to
her
shoulders
turned
square
in
her
chair
hi

walked
thus
guided
by
two
waiters
through
a
light
of
tossed
greetings

concealed
by
an
artificial
palm

as
a
ship
it
rode
over
but

squire

and
house
on

areas
of
stillness

processional
at
the
curb
a
red
hall
light
showed
against
the
and
two
windows
were
widely
illuminated
within
that
room
of
chromos
and
the
cold
horsehair
smell
of
unaired
years
silence
except
for
the
singing
of
three
had
momentarily
fallen
a
dozen
or
so
flushed
faces
grotesquely
sobered
staring
through
the
gaseous
fog
the
fluttering
lids
of
a
magistrate
whose
lips
habitually
fluttered
just
lifting
from
his
book
a
hysterical
catch
of
breath
from
miss
vera
de
long
broke
the
silence

reached
out
the
three

with
real
alligator
bags
and

shake
their
first
pullman
dust

eighteen
stories
up
through

above

aeriality

seventeenth
floor

known
how
to
raise
a
boy
like

famous
now
instead
of
notorious
what
you
be
he
patted
her
yellow
hair
tilting
her
head
back
against
his
arm
pinching
her
cheeks
together
and
kissing
her
puckered
mouth
dream

millionaire
kid

by
showing
you
the
color
of
his
coin
charley
she
sprang
back
from
the
curve
of
his
embrace
unshed
tears
immediately
distilled
why
honey
i
did
mean
it
that
way
i
did
mean
to
hurt
your
feelings
what
i
meant
was
loo
all
i
meant
was
it
coming
to
you
where
the
fun
be
if
i
could
make
this
town
point
up
its
ears
at
my
girl
nobody
knows
any
better
than
your
hubby
what
his
loo
was
cut
out
for
she
was
cut
out
for
queening
it
and
i
going
to
see
that
she
gets
what
her
due
would
be
surprised
if
the
papers
have
us
already
see
what
we
give
them
with
their
coffee
this
morning
he
unfolded
his
fresh
sheet
shaking
it
open
with
one
hand
and
still
holding
her
in
the
cove
of
his
arm
guess
we
missed
the
first
edition
but
they
get
us
sure
she
peered
at
the
sheet
over
his
shoulder
her
cheek
against
his
and
still
sobbing
a
bit
in
her
throat
the
jerking
of
her
breath
stopped
then
in
fact
it
was
as
if
both
their
breathing
had
let
down
with
the
oneness
of
a
clock
stopped
it
was
she
who
moved
first
falling
back
from
him
her
mouth
dropping
open
slightly
he
let
the
paper
fall
between
his
knees
the
blood
flowing
down
from
his
face
and
seeming
to
leave
him
leaner
charley
charley
darling
my
poor
old
man
he
said
in
a
voice
that
might
have
been
his
echo
in
a
cave
he
his
heart
must
have
give
out
on
him
charley
while
he
slept
in
the
night
my
poor
old
man
she
stretched
out
her
hand
timidly
to
his
shoulder
charley
boy
my
poor
boy
he
reached
up
to
cover
her
timid
touch
still
staring
ahead
as
if
a
mental
apathy
had
clutched
him
he
died
like
he
lived
gad
it
tough
it
it
was
your
fault
darling
god
forgive
me
for
speaking
against
the
dead
but
everybody
knows
he
was
a
hard
man
charley
the
way
he
used
to
beat
you
up
instead
of
showing
you
the
right
way
poor
old
man
i
guess
he
did
know
my
old
man

she
crept
closer
encircling
his
neck
and
her
wet
cheek
close
to
his
dry
one

at

held
her
cheek
to
his

veered
out
of
their
course

down
to
his
waistcoat

his
hair
placing
her
rich
moist
lips
to
his
eyelids
my

she
reached
out

of
the

he
let
his
forehead
drop
against
her
arm
and
in
the
long
silence
that
ensued
she
sat
there
her
hand
on
his
hair
the
roar
of
traffic
seventeen
stories
below
came
up
through
the
open
windows
like
the
sound
of
high
seas
and
from
where
she
sat
staring
out
between
the
curtains
it
was
as
if
the
close
july
sky
dipped
down
to
meet
that
sea
and
space
swam
around
them
o

eyes
to
hide
their
tears

stung
loo
nothing
on
earth

change
that
she
turned
his

this
morning

of
a
sudden
last
night

your
bluff
through

it
was
because
i
knew
i
had
you
where

that
minute
honey

chance

she
wound
her
arms
round
him
trembling
between
the
suppressed
hysteria
of
tears
and
laughter
not
a
chance
charley
he
jerked
her
so
that
her
face
fell
back
from
him
foreshortened
loo
oh
girl
oh
girl
her
throat
was
tight
and
would
not
give
her
voice
for
coherence
charley
we
we
show
you
me
looking
out
above
her
head
at
the
vapory
sky
showing
through
the
parting
of
the
curtains
rigidity
raced
over
cox
stiffening
his
hold
of
her
the
lean
look
had
come
out
in
his
face
the
flanges
of
his
nose
quivered
his
head
went
up
vi
nightshade
over
the
silent
places
of
the
world
flies
the
vulture
of
madness
pausing
to
wheel
above
isolated
where
a
wife
already
dizzy
with
the
pressure
of
rarefied
silence
looks
up
magnetized
then
across
the
flat
stretches
his
shadow
under
him
moving
across
moor
and
the
sand
of
desert
slowing
at
the
perpetually
eastern
edge
of
a
mirage
brushing
his
actual
wings
against
the
brick
of
city
walls
the
garret
of
a
dreamer
with
reality
flopping
until
she
comes
to
gaze
outside
the
window
of
one
so
alone
in
a
crowd
that
her
four
walls
are
closing
in
upon
her
lowering
over
a
childless
house
on
the
edge
of
a
village
were
times
when
hanna
burkhardt
who
lived
on
the
edge
of
a
village
in
one
such
childless
house
could
in
her
fancy
hear
the
flutter
of
wings
too
there
had
once
been
a
visit
to
a
doctor
in
high
street
because
of
those
and
the
sudden
terror
of
not
being
able
to
swallow
he
had
stethoscoped
and
prescribed
her
change
of
scene
had
followed
two
weeks
with
cousins
fifty
miles
away
near
lida
ohio
and
a
day
in
cincinnati
allowed
by
her
railroad
ticket
but
six
months
after
in
the
circle
of
glow
from
a
tablelamp
that
left
the
corners
of
the
room
in
a
chiaroscuro
kind
of
gloom
there
were
again
noises
of
wings
rustling
and
of
water
lapping
and
the
old
stricture
of
the
throat
across
the
table
a
paisley
cover
between
them
john
burkhardt
his
short
spade
of
beard
already
down
over
his
arm
hanging
lax
over
his
and
newspaper
fallen
sat
forward
in
a
hunched
attitude
of
sleep
whistling
noises
coming
occasionally
through
his
breathing
a
china
clock
the
centerpiece
of
the
mantel
ticked
spang
into
the
silence
enhancing
it
hands
in
lap
head
back
against
the
mat
of
her
chair
burkhardt
looked
straight
ahead
of
her
into
this
silence
at
a
closed
door
hung
with
a
newspaper
rack
at
a
horsehair
divan
a
great
on
the
carpet
beside
it
a
nickelplated
warrior
gleamed
from
the
top
of
a
baseburner
that
showed
pink
through
its
mica
doors
he
stood
out
against
the
wallpaper
and
a
framed
declaration
of
independence
hanging
left
a
coal
fell
burkhardt
sat
up
shook
himself
of
sleep
little
chilly
he
said
and
in
carpet
slippers
and
unbuttoned
waistcoat
moved
over
to
the
his
feet
to
avoid
sloughing
not
leaving
the
floor
he
was
slightly
stooped
the
sateen
back
to
his
waistcoat
hiking
to
the
curve
of
him
but
he
swung
up
the
scuttle
with
a
swoop
rattling
coal
freely
down
into
the
orifice
ugh
do
she
said
i
burnin
up
he
jerked
back
the
scuttle
returning
to
his
chair
and
picking
up
the
fallen
newspaper
drew
down
his
spectacles
from
off
his
brow
and
fell
immediately
back
into
close
puckered
scrutiny
of
the
printed
page
what
time
is
it
burkhardt
that
old
thing
on
the
mantel
crazy
he
drew
out
a
great
silver
watch
o
god
she
said
i
thought
it
was
about
ten
the
clock
ticked
in
roundly
again
except
when
he
rustled
his
paper
in
the
turning
the
fire
was
crackling
now
too
in
sharp
explosions
beyond
the
arc
of
lamp
the
room
was
deeper
than
ever
in
shadow
finally
john
burkhardt
head
relaxed
again
to
his
the
paper
falling
gently
away
to
the
floor
she
regarded
his
lips
puffing
out
as
he
breathed
hands
clasped
arms
full
length
on
the
table
it
was
as
if
the
flood
of
words
pressing
against
the
walls
of
her
to
be
shrieked
rather
than
spoken
was
flowing
over
to
him
he
jerked
erect
again
regarding
her
through
blinks
must
dozed
off
he
said
reaching
down
for
his
newspaper
she
was
winding
her
fingers
now
in
and
out
among
themselves
burkhardt
eh
what
does
a
person
do
that
smotherin
eh
i
know
that
what
i
doing
smotherin
a
touch
of
the
old
trouble
hanna
she
sat
erect
with
her
rather
large
white
hands
at
the
heavy
base
to
her
long
throat
they
rose
and
fell
to
her
breathing
like
heine
who
said
so
potently
i
am
a
tragedy
so
she
too
in
the
sulky
light
of
her
eyes
and
the
pulled
lips
and
the
ripple
of
shivers
over
her
proclaimed
it
of
herself
god
what
i
do
burkhardt
what
i
do
go
lay
down
on
the
sofa
a
bit
hanna
i
cover
you
with
a
plaid
the
again
bothering
you
what
i
do
and
nothing
left
but
bed
i
must
dozed
off
hanna
yes
you
must
dozed
off
she
laughed
her
voice
eaten
into
with
the
acid
of
her
own
scorn
yes
you
must
dozed
off
the
same
way
as
you
dozed
off
last
night
and
last
month
and
last
year
and
the
last
eight
years
the
best
years
of
my
life
that
what
you
dozed
off
john
burkhardt
he
dozed
off
she
repeated
her
lips
quivering
and
lifting
to
reveal
the
white
line
of
her
large
teeth
yes
i
think
you
must
dozed
off
he
was
reading
again
in
stolid
profile
she
fell
to
tapping
the
broad
toe
of
her
shoe
her
light
dilated
eyes
staring
above
his
head
she
was
spare
and
yet
withal
a
roundness
left
to
the
cheek
and
forearm
and
with
a
certain
swing
where
it
flowed
down
into
straight
hips
there
was
a
bony
olympian
kind
of
bigness
about
her
beneath
the
blue
shirtwaist
dress
her
chest
was
high
as
if
vocal
she
was
not
without
youth
her
head
went
up
like
a
stag
to
the
passing
of
a
band
in
the
street
or
a
glance
thrown
after
her
or
the
contemplation
of
her
own
freshly
washed
yellow
hair
in
the
sunlight
she
wore
a
seven
glove
but
her
nails
had
great
depth
and
pinkness
and
each
a
clear
they
were
dug
down
now
into
her
palms
for
god
sake
talk
say
something
or
i
go
mad
he
laid
his
paper
across
his
knee
pushing
up
his
glasses
sing
a
little
something
hanna
you
right
restless
this
evening
she
said
her
face
wry
if
i
got
to
sit
and
listen
to
that
clock
ticking
for
many
more
evenings
of
this
winter
find
yourself
with
a
raving
maniac
on
your
hands
that
how
restless
i
am
he
rustled
his
paper
again
do
read
she
cried
do
you
dare
read
he
sat
staring
ahead
in
a
heavy
kind
of
silence
breathing
outward
and
passing
his
hand
across
his
brow
her
breathing
too
was
distinctly
audible
lay
down
a
bit
hanna
i
cover
you
if
they
land
me
in
the
they
can
write
on
your
tombstone
when
you
die
long
burkhardt
went
stark
raving
mad
crazy
with
hucking
at
home
because
i
let
her
life
get
to
be
a
machine
from
breakfast
to
bed
and
she
went
crazy
from
it
if
that
any
satisfaction
to
you
they
can
write
that
on
your
tombstone
he
mopped
his
brow
this
time
clearing
his
throat
you
knew
when
we
married
hanna
they
called
me
burkhardt
i
never
was

great
one

up
and
swallowed
me
now

in
all
these
years
never
so
much
as
a
dance
or
a
as
far
as
middletown
church
church
church
till
i
could
scream
at
the
sight
of
it
not
a
year
of
my
married
life
that
been
a
lodestone
on
my
neck
eight
of
eight
i
not
sayin
i
not
to
blame
hanna
a
woman
like
you
naturally
likes
life
i
never
wanted
to
hold
you
back
if
i
tired
nights
and
dead
on
my
feet
from
twelve
hours
on
i
never
wanted
you
to
change
your
ways
yes
with
a
husband
at
home
in
bed
i
be
a
fine
one
chasin
around
this
town
alone
would
i
that
the
thanks
a
woman
gets
for
i
always
kept
hopin
hanna
i
could
get
you
to
take
more
to
the
home
the
home
you
mean
the
tomb
why
with
the
right
attention
we
got
as
fine
an
old
place
here
as
there
is
in
this
part
of
town
hanna
if
only
you
felt
like
giving
it
a
few
more
touches
that
kinda
would
make
a
out
of
it
it
changed
a
whit
from
the
way
me
and
my
old
father
run
it
together
a
little
touch
here
and
there
hanna
would
help
to
keep
you
occupied
and
happier
if
i
know
i
know
what
comin
the
pergola
i
had
built
i
used
to
think
maybe
you
get
to
putter
out
there
in
the
with
it
trailin
vines
the
outfit
i
had
sent
down
from
cincinnati
when
i
seen
it
advertised
in
the
a
spaniel
or
two
from
old
cocker
new
litter
barkin
around
all
them
things
i
used
to
think
would
give
our
little
place
here
a
feelin
that
would
change
both
of
us
for
the
better
with
a
more
feelin
things
might
have
been
different
between
us
hanna
keepin
a
menagerie
of
mangy
spaniels
ai
my
idea
of
livin
aw
now
hanna
what
the
use
puttin
it
that
way
take
for
instance
it
been
a
plan
of
mine
to
paint
the
house
with
the
shutters
green
and
a
band
of
green
shingles
runnin
up
under
the
eaves
a
little
encouragement
from
you
and
we
could
perk
the
place
up
right
smart
all
these
years
kinda
gone
down
even
more
than
when
i
was
a
bachelor
in
it
sunk
in
kinda
like
them
iron
jardinières
i
had
put
in
the
front
yard
for
you
to
keep
evergreen
in
it
them
little
things
hanna
then
that
that
old
idea
of
mine
to
take
a
little
one
from
the
orphanage
a
young
around
the
o
lord
i
ai
goin
to
mention
it
if
it
aggravates
you
but
but
makin
a
home
out
of
this
gray
old
place
would
help
us
both
hanna
there
no
that
it
what
i
hoped
for
when
i
brought
you
home
a
bride
here
just
had
it
kinda
planned
you
putterin
around
the
place
in
some
kind
of
a
pink
apron
like
you
women
can
rig
yourselves
up
in
and
there
ai
a
girl
in
adalia
has
dropped
out
of
things
the
way
i
have
i
had
a
singin
voice
that
everybody
in
this
town
said
there
the
piano
hanna
bought
special
for
it
i
got
a
contralto
that
there
never
was
anything
give
me
more
pleasure
than
them
first
years
you
used
it
i
ai
much
to
express
myself
but
it
was
mighty
fine
hanna
to
hear
you
yes
i
know
you
snored
into
my
singin
with
enjoyment
all
right
it
the
twelve
hours
on
my
feet
that
just
seem
to
make
me
dead
to
the
world
come
evening
a
girl
that
had
the
whole
town
wavin
flags
at
her
when
she
sung
holy
city
at
the
nineteen
hundred
kittie
scogin
bevins
one
of
the
biggest
singers
in
new
york
nothing
but
my
chorus
where
it
got
me
these
eight
years
nowheres
she
had
enough
sense
to
cut
loose
from
ed
bevins
who
was
a
lodestone
too
and
beat
it
she
singing
now
in
new
york
for
forty
a
week
with
a
voice
that
was
strong
enough
to
be
more
than
chorus
to
mine
kittie
scogin
hanna
is
a
poor
comparison
for
any
woman
to
make
with
herself
it
is
is
it
well
i
do
see
it
thataway
when
she
stepped
off
the
train
last
week
comin
back
to
visit
her
old
mother

wished
the
whole
depot
would
open
up
and
swallow
me

what
i
wished
me
and
her
that
used
to
be
took
for
sisters
i
eight
months
younger
and
i
look
eight
years
older

she
stepped
off
that
train
in
them
white
furs
and
a
purple
i
just
wished
to
god
the
whole
depot
would
open
and
swallow
me
that
girl
had
sense
o
god

she
have
sense
they
say
her
sense
is
what
killed
ed
bevins
of
shame
and
heartbreak
say
do
tell
me

was
town
talk
the
way
he
made
her
toady
to
his
folks
even
after
he
been
cut
off
without
a
cent
kittie
told
me
herself
the
very
sight
of
the
old
bevins
place
over
on
orchard
street
gives
her
the
creeps
down
her
back
if
not
for
old
lady
scogin
up
in
the
seventies
she
never
put
her
foot
back
in
this
dump

girl

an
influence
on
you

heavily

old
dog
new
tricks
it
a
fact
i
ai
much
good
after
eight
evenin
it
a
fact
a
fact
they
sat
then
in
a
further
silence
that
engulfed
them
like
fog
a
shift
of
wind
blew
a
gust
of
dry
snow
against
the
with
a
little
sleety
noise
and
as
another
evidence
of
rising
wind
a
jerk
of
it
came
down
the
flue
rattling
the
fender
of
a
disused
grate
we
better
keep
the
water
in
the
kitchen
runnin
the
freeze

tock
she
had
not
moved
still
sitting
staring
above
the
top
of
his
head
he
slid
out
his
watch
yawning
well

you
think
it
too
raw
for
the
movin
pictures

i
guess

to
widow
dinninger
to
pass
the
time
of
evenin
i
keep
the
door
on
the
latch
she
sprang
up
snatching
a
heavy
black
shawl
throwing
it
over
her
and
clutching
it
closed
at
the
throat
where
you
goin
hanna
walkin

along
its
picket

off
toward
the

are
long
in
autumn
their
great
ripening
to
purple
frost
come
winter
there
is
almost
an
instant
shriveling
to
naked
stalk
and
the
behind

comes
through
even
the
houses
seem
immediately
to
darken
of
last

and
with
windows
closed
the
shades
are
drawn
oftener
than
not
adalia
spends
its
evening
snugly
behind
these
drawn
shades
in
great
scoured
kitchens
or
the
dark
when
burkhardt
stepped
out
into
an
evening
left
thus
to
its
stilly
depth
shades
drawn
against
it
a
light
dust
of
snow
just
fallen
was
scurrying
before
the
wind
like
something
phantom
with
its
skirts
blowing
forward
little
drifts
of
it
dry
as
powder
had
blown
up
against
the
porch
she
sidestepped
them
hurrying
down
a
brick
walk
and
out
a
picket
gate
that
did
not
swing
entirely
after
behind
her
the
house
with
its
wimple
of
shingle
roof
and
unlighted
front
windows
seemed
to
recede
somewhere
darkly
she
stood
an
undecided
moment
her
face
into
the
wind
half
down
the
block
an
swayed
and
gave
out
a
moving
circle
of
light
finally
she
turned
her
back
and
went
off
down
a
past
a
lighted
corner
grocer
crossed
a
street
to
avoid
the
black
mouth
of
an
alley
then
off
at
another
right
angle
the
houses
here
were
smaller
shoulder
to
shoulder
and
directly
on
the
sidewalk
before
one
of
these
for
no
particular
reason
distinguishable
from
the
others
burkhardt
stepped
up
two
shallow
steps
and
turned
a
key
in
the
center
of
the
door
which
set
up
a
buzz
on
its
reverse
side
her
hand
where
it
clutched
the
shawl
at
her
throat
was
reddening
and
roughening
the
knuckles
pushing
up
high
and
white
waiting
she
turned
her
back
to
the
wind
her
body
hunched
up
against
it
there
was
a
moving
about
within
the
scrape
of
a
match
and
finally
the
door
opening
slightly
a
figure
peering
out
it
me
scogin
hanna
burkhardt
the
door
swung
back
then
revealing
a
parlor
opening
without
introduction
of
hall
from
the
sidewalk

hanna
burkhardt

and

sofa
well
forward
after
the
manner
of
those
who
relax
but
ill
to
the
give
of
upholstery
she
was
like
a
study
of
what
might
have
been
the
grandmother
of
one
of
rembrandt
studies
of
a
grandmother
there
were
lines
crawling
over
her
face
too
manifold
for
even
the
etcher
stroke
and
over
her
little
shriveling
hands
that
were
too
for
warmth
there
is
actually
something
avian
comes
with
the
years
in
the
frontal
bone
pushing
itself
forward
the
cheeks
receding
and
the
eyes
still
bright
there
was
yet
that
trenchant
quality
in
scogin
in
the
voice
and
gaze
of
her
sit
down

swung
her
gaze
reluctantly
to

from

from

in

finish
the

her

with

and
without

returned
to

she
said
and
leaned
her
head
on
her
hand
i
better
get
me
a
job
hollerin
down
a
well
her
companion
drained
his
stemless
glass
with
a
sharp
jerking
back
of
the
head
his
was
the
short
stocky
kind
of
assurance
which

to
say

or
four
nights

it
from

a
whistle
in
it
somewhere
just
the
same
she
said
pushing
away
her
glass
my
future
in
this
business
is
behind
me
he
regarded
her
slumped
slightly
in
his
chair
celluloid
toothpick
dangling
there
was
something
square
about
his
face
abetted
by
a
toupee
of
great
craftsmanship
which
revealed
itself
only
in
the
jointure
over
the
ears
of
its
slightly
lighter
hair
with
the
brown
of
his
own
there
was
a
monogram
of
silk
on
his
of
gold
on
his
and
of
diamonds
on
the
black
band
across
the
slight
rotundity
of
his
waistcoat
never
you
mind
i
for
you
girl
he
said
there
was
an
undeniable
of
years
in
miss
de
long
even
the
very
texture
of
her
seemed
younger
and
the
skin
massaged
to
a
new
creaminess
the
high
coiffure
blonder
the
eyes
quicker
to
dart
lay
off
candy
kid
she
said
you
going
to
sugar

another
fizz
he
said
clicking
his
fingers
for
a
waiter

to
please
the
bold
bad
man

said

sipped

to

depth
of
the

he
said
lifting
the
glass
to
her
lips
they
were
well
concealed
and
back
away
from
the
thinning
patter
of
the
crowd
so
that
as
he
neared
her
he
let
his
face
almost
graze
indeed
touch
hers
she
made
a
great
pretense
of
choking
burns
drink
it
a
major
she
bubbled
into
the
glass
her
eyes
laughing
at
him
above
its
rim

her
forefinger
into
her
fresh
glass

it
at
him
so
that
he
blinked
under
the
tiny
spray
that

she
said
giggling

was
now
repeatedly
catching
herself
up
from
a
too
constant
impulse

reaching

resolute
not

jerked
back
from

high
flush
which
she
could
not
control
and
the
gaze
heavy
lidded

at

toward

he
cast
a
glance
around
their
deserted
edge
of
the
room
a
waiter
painstakingly
oblivious
stood
two
tables
back
would
i
be
better
off
out
of

why

was
trembling
down
with
a
suppression
of
rage
and
concern
for

rising
gale

her
voice

outburst

and
broke
on
a
wave
of
hysteria

it
was
then
kaminer
pushed
back
his
chair
flopped
down
his
napkin
and
rose
breathing
heavily
enough
but
his
face
set
in
an
exaggerated
kind
of
quietude
as
he
moved
through
the
maze
of
tables
exchanged
a
check
for
his
hat
and
walked
out
for
a
stunned
five
minutes
her
tears
as
it
were
seared
she
sat
after
him
the
waiter
had
withdrawn
to
the
extreme
left
of
the
deserted
edge
of
the
room
talking
behind
his
hand
to
two
colleagues
in
servility
their
faces
listening
and
breaking
into
smiles
finally
miss
de
long
rose
moving
through
the
zigzag
paths
of
empty
tables
toward
a
deserted
in
there
she
slid
into
slippers
and
a
pulled
on
over
the
pink
silk
tucking
it
up
around
the
waist
so
that
it
did
not
sag
from
beneath
the
hem
squirmed
into
a
jacket
with
a
false
dicky
made
to
emulate
a
and
a

hung
with
a
purple
as
she
went
out

closing
its
front
doors
outside
not
even
to
be
gainsaid
by
sixth
avenue
the
night
was
like
a
moist
flower
held
to
the
face
a
spring
shower
hardly
fallen
was
already
drying
on
the
sidewalks
and
from
the
patch
of
bryant
park
across
the
maze
of
there
stole
the
immemorial
scent
of
and
black
earth
a
crescent
of
hyacinths
giving
off
their
light
steam
of
fragrance
how
insidious
is
an
old
scent
it
can
creep
into
the
heart
like
an
ache
who
has
not
loved
beside
thyme
or
at
the
sweetness
of
dusk
dear
silenced
laughs
can
come
back
on
a
whiff
from
a
florist
shop
oh
there
is
a
nostalgia
lurks
in
old
scents
even
to
hanna
de
long
hurrying
eastward
on
street
huggingly
against
the
shadow
of
darkened
there
was
a
new
sting
of
tears
at
the
smell
of
earth
daring
in
the
lull
of
a
city
night
to
steal
out
there
are
always
these
dark
figures
that
scuttle
thus
through
the
first
hours
of
the
morning
whither
twice
remarks
were
flung
after
her
from
passing
figures
in
furtive
remarks
through
closed
lips
at
five
minutes
past
one
she
was
at
the
grating
of
a
that
was
more
ornate
than
a
rajah
dream

she
again
bit
open
the
corner
knot
of
her
handkerchief
when
hanna
de
long
freshly
of
train
dust
walked
down
third
street
away
from
the
station
old
man
rentzenauer
for
springs
coaxing
over
the
same
garden
was
spraying
a
hose
over
a
of
petunias
his
waistcoat
hanging
open
and
in
the
purpling
light
his
old
head
merging
back
against
a
house
the
color
of
gray
weather
and
half
a
century
of
service
at
sight
of
him
who
had
shambled
so
through
all
of
her
girlhood
such
a
trembling
seized
hold
of
hanna
de
long
that
she
turned
off
down
amboy
street
making
another
wide
detour
to
avoid
a
group
on
the
koerner
porch
finally
approaching
second
street
from
the
somewhat
straggly
end
of
it
farthest
from
the
station
she
was
trembling
so
that
occasionally
she
stopped
against
a
vertigo
that
went
with
it
wiped
up
under
the
curtain
of
purple
veil
at
the
beads
of
perspiration
which
would
spring
out
along
her
upper
lip
she
was
quite
washed
of
rouge
except
just
a
swift
of
it
over
the
she
had
taken
out
the
dicky
too
and
for
some
reason
filled
in
there
with
a
flounce
of
pink
net
ripped
off
from
the
little
ruffles
that
had
flowed
out
from
her
sleeves
she
was
without
baggage
at
ludlow
street
she
could
suddenly
see
the
house
the
trees
meeting
before
it
in
a
lace
of
green
the
two
iron
jardinières
empty
they
had
been
painted
and
were
drying
now
of
a
coat
when
she
finally
went
up
the
brick
walk
she
thought
once
that
she
could
not
reach
the
bell
with
the
strength
left
to
pull
it
she
did
though
pressing
with
her
two
hands
to
her
left
side
as
she
waited
the
house
was
in
the
process
of
painting
too
still
wet
under
a
first
wash
of
gray
the
pergola
also
the
door
swung
back
and
then
a
figure
emerged
full
from
a
background
of
familiarly
dim
hallway
and
curve
of
banister
she
was
stout
enough
to
be
panting
slightly
and
above
the
apron
her
face
was
ruddy
forty
and
ever
so
inclined
to
smile
yes

from

caught
her
by
a
rear
leg
as
she
leaped
back

to

her
under

arm

three
diminutive
punishments

shaggy

walked
swiftly

back

seeming
to
look
out
of
it

so
whitely

out
on
the
floor
in
that
kind
of
dance
with
old
man
shulof
your
hand
on
your
hip
and
your
head
jerking
it
up
there
was
a
girl
on
the
floor
your
own
daughter
included
could
touch
you
and
i
giving
it
to
you
straight
that
old
thing
it
a
russian
my
mother
taught
me
the
first
year
we
were
in
this
country
i
was
three
years
old
then
and
when
she
got
just
crazy
with
homesickness
we
used
to
dance
it
to
each
other
evenings
on
the
kitchen
floor
say
have
you
heard
the
news
no
guess
ca
hammerstein
is
bringing
over
the
crowned
heads
of
europe
for
vaudeville
coblenz
moved
back
a
step
her
mouth
falling
open
why
milton
bauer
in
the
old
country
a
man
could
be
strung
up
for
saying
less
than
that
that
did
get
across
try
another
a
frenchman
and
his
wife
were
traveling
in
russia
and
if
if
you
had
an
old
mother
like
mine
milton
eating
out
her
heart
and
her
days
and
her
weeks
and
her
months
over
a
husband
grave
somewhere
in
siberia
and
a
son
grave
somewhere
in
kishinef
you
see
the
joke
neither
bauer
executed
a
pat
sharply
against
the
back
of
his
hand
keeper
he
said
put
me
in
the
brain
ward
i
i
sorry
so
help
me
did
mean
to
how
is
your
mother
seems
to
me
at
the
dance
the
other
night
selene
said
she
was
fine
and
dandy
selene
ai
the
best
judge
of
her
poor
old
grandmother
it
hard
for
a
young
girl
to
have
patience
for
old
age
sitting
and
chewing
all
day
over
the
past
it
right
pitiful
the
way
her
grandmother
knows
it
too
and
makes
herself
talk
english
all
the
time
to
please
the
child
and
tries
to
perk
up
for
her
selene
thank
god
suffered
and
ca
sympathize
what
ailing
her
i
kinda
miss
seeing
the
old
lady
sitting
down
here
in
the
store
it
the
last
year
or
so
milt
just
like
all
of
a
sudden
a
woman
as
active
as
mama
always
was
her
health
and
her
mind
kind
of
went
off
with
a
pop
thu
thu
doctor
says
with
care
she
can
live
for
years
but
but
it
seems
terrible
the
way
her
poor
mind
keeps
skipping
back
past
all
these
thirty
years
in
america
to
even
weeks
before
i
was
born
the
night
they
took
my
father
off
to
siberia
with
his
bare
feet
in
the
snow
for
distributing
papers
they
found
on
him
papers
that
used
the
word
and
the
time
ten
years
later
they
shot
down
my
brother
right
in
front
of
her
for
the
same
reason
she
keeps
living
it
over
living
it
over
till
i
could
die
say
ai
that
just
a
shame
though
living
it
and
living
it
and
living
it
the
night
with
me
a
heavy
in
her
arms
that
she
got
us
to
the
border
dragging
a
pack
of
linens
with
her
the
night
my
father
feet
were
bleeding
in
the
snow
when
they
took
him
how
with
me
a
kid
in
the
crib
my
my
brother
face
was
crushed
in
with
a
heel
and
a
spur
all
night
sometimes
she
cries
in
her
sleep
begging
to
go
back
to
find
the
graves
all
day
she
sits
making
raffia
wreaths
to
take
back
making
wreaths
making
wreaths
say
ai
that
tough
it
a
godsend
she
got
the
eyes
to
do
it
it
wonderful
the
way
she
reads
in
english
too
there
ai
a
daily
she
misses
without
them
and
the
wreaths

remote
sea

turning
taupe
the
dusk
of
early
spring
which
is
faintly
tinged
with
violet
invading
beside
the
stove
a
with
faint
fire
showing
through
its
mica
the
identity
of
her
figure
merged
with
the
fat
upholstery
of
the
chair
except
where
the
faint
pink
through
the
mica
lighted
up
old
flesh
miriam
horowitz
full
of
years
and
senile
with
them
wove
with
grasses

écru
of
her

mounted
to

great
stack
in

attached
to

turning

down
from

the
shades
of

two

color
of

emerged
rather
startling
from

still
black

lay
back
in
her
chair
turning
her
profile
against
the
upholstered
back

a
wreath
and
a
trail
of
raffia
sliding
to
the
floor

sapped
from
beneath
the
skin
so
that
every
curve
had
collapsed
to
bagginess
the
cheeks
and
the
underchin
sagging
with
too
much
skin
even
the
hands
were
crinkled
like
too
large
gloves

wide
curiously
etched
marriage
band
hanging
loosely
from

selene
ai
that
something
ai
it
ai
it
large
drops
of
sweat
had
come
out
and
a
state
of
exhaustion
that
swept
completely
over
prostrating
the
huddled
form
in
the
chair
bed
my
bed
with
her
arms
twined
about
the
immediately
supporting
form
of
her
daughter
her
entire
weight
relaxed
and
footsteps
that
dragged
without
lift
one
after
the
other
horowitz
groped
out
one
hand
feeling
in
advance
into
the
gloom
of
a
room
adjoining
rest
o
my
god
rest
yes
yes
mama
lean
on
me
my
bed
yes
yes
darling
bed
her
voice
had
died
now
to
a
whimper
that
lay
on
the
room
after
she
had
passed
out
of
it
when
selene
coblenz
with
a
gust
that
swept
the
room
sucking
the
lace
curtains
back
against
the
panes
flung
open
the
door
upon
that
chromatic
scene
the
two
jets
of
gas
were
singing
softly
into
its
silence
and
within
the
baseburner
the
pink
mica
had
cooled
to
gray
sweeping
open
that
door
she
closed
it
softly
standing
for
the
moment
against
it
her
hand
crossed
in
back
and
on
the
knob
it
was
as
if
standing
there
with
her
head
cocked
and
beneath
a
shadowy
blue
a
smile
coming
out
something
within
her
was
playing
sweetly
insistent
to
be
heard
philomela
at
the
first
sound
of
her
nightingale
self
must
have
stood
thus
trembling
with
melody
opposite
her
above
the
crowded
mantelpiece
and
surmounted
by
a
raffia
wreath
the
gaze
of
her
deceased
maternal
grandfather
abetted
by
a
horrible
device
of
photography
followed
her
his
eyes
focusing
the
entire
room
at
a
glance
impervious
to
that
scrutiny
miss
coblenz
moved
a
tiptoe
step
or
two
farther
into
the
room
lifting
off
her
hat
staring
and
smiling
through
a
cabinet
of
knickknacks
at
what
she
saw
far
and
beyond
beneath
the
two
jets
high
lights
in
her
hair
came
out
bronze
showing
through
the
brown
waves
and
the
patches
of
curls
brought
out
over
her
cheeks
in
her
dress
with
the
row
of
silver
buttons
down
what
was
hip
before
the
hipless
age
the
chest
sufficiently
concave
and
the
silhouette
a
mere
stroke
of
a
hard
pencil
miss
selene
coblenz
measured
up
and
down
to
america
venus
de
milo
whose
chief
curvature
is
of
the
spine
and
that
slimness
enhanced
by
a
conscious
kind
of
collapse
beneath
the
girdle
that
reached
up
to
her
throat
hers
were
those
proportions
which
strong
women
eschewing
the
would
earn
by
the
sweat
of
the
turkish
bath
when
miss
coblenz
caught
her
eye
in
the
square
of
mirror
above
the
mantelpiece
her
hands
flew
to
her
cheeks
to
feel
of
their
redness
they
were
soft
cheeks
smooth
with
the
pollen
of
youth
and
hands
still
casing
them
she
moved
another
step
toward
the
portièred
door
mama
coblenz
emerged
immediately
finger
up
for
silence
kissing
her
daughter
on
the
little
spray
of
gramaw
just
had
a
terrible
spell
she
dropped
down
into
the
upholstered
chair
beside
the
the
pink
and
moisture
of
exertion
out
in
her
face
took
to
fanning
herself
with
the
end
of
a
flung
across
her
arm
poor
gramaw
she
said
poor
gramaw
miss
coblenz
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
slim
chair
and
took
to
gathering
the
dress
into
little
plaits
at
her
knee
of
course
if
you
do
want
to
know
where
i
been
or
anything
coblenz
jerked
herself
to
the
moment
did
mama

have
a
good
time
look
at
your
dress
all
dusty
you
ought
to
wear
your
best
in
that
little
flivver
suddenly
miss
coblenz
raised
her
glance
her
red
mouth
bunched
her
eyes
all
iris
of
course
if
you
do
want
to
know
anything
at
that
large
brilliant
gaze

leaned
forward

floor
beside
her
mother
knee

like
alma
yawitz
i
am
i
am
uncle
uncle

us
up
like
he
did
leon
and
irma
only
i
do
want
mahogany
i
want
circassian
walnut
he
gave
them
their
too
puritan
design
for
an
engagement
present
think
of
it
mama
me
having
that
irma
sinsheimer
for
a
relation
it
always
made
her
sore
when
i
got
chums
with
amy
at
school
and
got
my
nose
in
it
with
the
acme
crowd
and
and
she
change
her
tune
now
i
guess
me
marrying
her
husband
second
cousin
did
lester
want
to
to
come
in
for
a
while
selene
to
to
see
me
sitting
there
on
her
heels
miss
coblenz
looked
away
answering
with
her
face
in
profile
yes
only
i
well
if
you
want
to
know
it
mama
it
no
fun
for
a
girl
to
bring
a
boy
like
lester
up
here
in
in
this
crazy
room
all
hung
up
with
gramaw
wreaths
and
half
the
time
her
sitting
out
there
in
the
dark
looking
in
at
us
through
the
door
and
talking
to
herself
gramaw
an
old
is
it
any
wonder
i
down
at
amy
half
the
time
how
do
you
think
a
girl
feels
to
have
gramaw
keep
hanging
onto
that
old
black
wig
of
hers
and
not
letting
me
take
the
crayons
or
wreaths
down
off
the
wall
in
lester
crowd
they
do
know
nothing
about
revolutionary
stuff
and
persecutions
grandmother
do
even
talk
with
an
accent
and
lester
says
his
grandmother
came
from
that
french
they
think
only
tailors
and
men
and
selene
well
they
do
you
you
all
right
mama
as
up
to
date
as
any
of
them
but
how
do
you
think
a
girl
feels
with
gramaw
always
harping
right
in
front
of
everybody
the
way
granpa
was
a
revolutionist
and
was
hustled
off
barefooted
to
siberia
like
a
tramp
and
the
way
she
was
cooking
black
beans
when
my
uncle
died
other
girls
grandmothers
do
tell
everything
they
know
alma
yawitz
grandmother
wears
lorgnettes
and
you
told
me
yourself
they
came
from
nearly
the
same
part
of
the
pale
as
gramaw
but
you
hear
them
remembering
it
alma
yawitz
says
she
on
both
sides
people
do
tell
everything
they
know
anyway
where
a
girl
got
herself
as
far
as
i
have
through
sobs
that
rocked
her
coblenz
looked
down
upon
her
daughter
your
poor
old
grandmother
do
deserve
that
from
you
in
her
day
she
worked
her
hands
to
the
bone
for
you
with
the
kind
of
father
you
had
we
might
have
died
in
the
gutter
but
for
how
she
helped
to
keep
us
out
you
ungrateful
girl
your
poor
old
grandmother
that
suffered
so
terrible
i
know
it
mama
but
so
have
other
people
suffered
she
old
selene
old
i
tell
you
it
the
way
you
indulge
her
mama
i
seen
her
sitting
here
as
perk
as
you
please
and
the
minute
you
come
in
the
room
down
goes
her
head
like
like
she
was
dying
it
her
mind
selene
that
going
that
why
i
feel
if
i
could
only
get
her
back
she
ai
old
gramaw
ai
if
i
could
only
get
her
back
where
she
could
see
for
herself
the
graves
is
all
she
needs
all
old
people
think
of
the
grave
it
eating
her
eating
her
mind
mark
haas
is
going
to
fix
it
for
me
after
the
war
maybe
before
if
he
can
that
the
only
way
poor
gramaw
can
live
or
die
happy
selene
now
now
that
my
my
little
girl
ai
any
longer
my
responsibility
i
i
going
to
take
her
back
my
little
girl
her
hand
reached
out
caressing
the
smooth
head
her
face
projected
forward
and
the
eyes
yearning
down
my
all
it
you
will
be
my
responsibility
now
ma

first
thing
lester
says
was
a
flat
on
wasserman
and
a
spare
room
for

luny
selene
well
i
like
to
know
what
else
you
call
it
kidding
yourself
along
like
that
you
all
right
if
you
think
gramaw
with
her
life
all
lived
comes
first
before
me
with
all
my
life
to
live
all
right
your
poor
old
it
always
been
gramaw
first
in
this
house
anyway
i
could
even
have
company
since
i
grown
up
because
the
way
she
always
allowed
around
nobody
can
say
i
ai
good
to
gramaw
lester
says
it
beautiful
the
way
i
am
with
her
remembering
always
to
bring
the
newspapers
and
all
but
just
the
same
i
know
when
right
right
and
wrong
wrong
if
my
life
more
important
than
gramaw
with
hers
all
lived
all
right
go
ahead
selene
selene
ai
it
coming
to
gramaw
after
all
her
years
hard
work
helping
us
that
she
should
be
entitled
to
go
back
with
her
wreaths
for
the
graves
ai
she
entitled
to
die
with
that
off
her
poor
old
mind
you
bad
ungrateful
girl
you
it
coming
to
a
poor
old
woman
that
suffered
as
terrible
as
gramaw
that
i
should
find
a
way
to
take
her
back
take
her
back
where
to
jail
to
prison
in
siberia
herself
there
a
way
you
know
gramaw
too
old
to
take
a
trip
like
that
you
know
in
your
own
heart
she
wo
ever
see
that
day
even
before
the
war
much
less
now
there
was
a
chance
for
her
to
get
passports
back
there
i
do
say
it
ai
all
right
to
kid
her
along
but
when
it
comes
to
to
keeping
me
out
of
the
the
biggest
thing
that
can
happen
to
a
girl
when
gramaw
know
the
difference
if
you
keep
showing
her
the
it
ai
right
that
what
it
ai
it
ai
right
in
the
smallest
possible
compass
miss
coblenz
crouched
now
upon
the
floor
head
down
somewhere
in
her
knees
and
her
curving
back
racked
with
rising
sobs
selene
but
some
day
some
day
nothing
a
woman
like
gramaw
ca
do
much
more
than
go
once
a
year
and
then
you
talk
about
taking
her
to
russia
you
ca
get
in
there
i
tell
you
no
way
you
try
to
fix
it
after
the
way
gramaw
had
to
leave

in

faintly

still

faintly
heard
played
into
the
babel
light
glitteringly
filtered
through

glass
prisms
flowed
down
upon
the
dais
upon
miss
selene
coblenz
in
a
taffeta
that
wrapped
her
flat
waist
and
chest
like
a
calyx
and
suddenly
bloomed
into
the
petals
of
a
skirt
upon
lester
goldmark
his
long
body
barely
knitted
yet
to
man
estate
and
his
complexion
almost
clear
standing
omnivorous
omnipotent
omnipresent
his
hair
so
well
brushed
that
it
lay
like
black
japanning
a
white
carnation
at
his
silk
lapel
and
his
smile
slightly
projected
by
a
rush
of
very
white
teeth
to
the
very
front
next
in
line
coblenz
the
red
of
a
fervent
moment
high
in
her
face
beneath
the
bodice
the
swell
of
her
bosom
fast
and
her
hand
constantly
at
the
opening
and
shutting
of
a
fan
back
and
well
out
of
the
picture
a
potted
hydrangea
beside
the
louis
quinze
armchair
her
hands
in
silk
mitts
laid
out
along
the
sides
her
head
quavering
in
a
kind
of
mild
palsy
miriam
horowitz
smiling
and
quivering
her
state
of
bewilderment
with
an
unfailing
propensity
to
lay
hold
of
to
whomsoever

spake

his
hand
upon

her
glance
out
over
the
crowded
room
surging
with
a
wave
of
plumes
and
clipped
heads
like
a
swaying
bucket
of
water
which
crowds

does
not
lap
over
its
sides

crowd

in

for

some
newspapers
ma
and
i
brought
her
a
wreath
down
to
keep
her
quiet
it
wrapped
in
her
shawl
her
skirts
delicately
lifted
miss
coblenz
stepped
down
off
the
dais
with
her
cloud
of
enveloping
her
she
was
like
a
springtime
done
in
the
key
of
botticelli
said
goldmark
tilting
her
elbow
for
the
downward
step
said
miss
coblenz
relaxing
to
the
support
gathering
up
her
plentiful
skirts
coblenz
stepped
off
too
but
back
toward
the
secluded
chair
beside
the
potted
hydrangea
a
fine
line
of
pain
like
a
cord
tightening
was
binding
her
head
and
she
put
up
two
fingers
to
each
temple
pressing
down
the
throb
coblenz
see
what
i
got
for
you
she
turned
smiling
you
look
like
you
need
salad
and
green
you
look
like
you
needed
what
i
wanted
a
cup
of
coffee
aw
haas
now
where
in
the
world
aw
mr
haas
with
a
steaming
cup
outheld
and
carefully
out
of
collision
with
the
crowd
haas
unflapped
a
napkin
with
his
free
hand
inserting
his
foot
in
the
rung
of
a
chair
and
dragging
it
toward
her
now
he
cried
sit
and
watch
me
take
care
of
you
there
comes
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men
when
the
years
lap
softly
leaving
no
particular
inundations
on
the
celebrated
sands
of
time
between
forty
and
fifty
that
span
of
years
which
begin
the
first
slight
gradations
from
the
apex
of
life
the
gray
hair
upstanding
like
a
brush
off
haas
brow
had
not
so
much
as
whitened
or
the
slight
paunchiness
enhanced
even
the
of
a
button
when
haas
smiled
his
mustache
which
ended
in
a
slight
but
not
waxed
flourish
lifted
to
reveal
a
smile
of
the
artistry
of
careful
dentistry
and
when
upon
occasion
he
threw
back
his
head
to
laugh
the
roof
of
his
mouth
was
his
own
he
smiled
now
peering
through
spectacles
attached
by
a
chain
to
a
left
ear
sit
he
cried
and
let
me
serve
you
standing
there
with
a
diffidence
which
she
could
not
crowd
down
coblenz
smiled
through
closed
lips
that
would
pull
at
the
corners
the
idea
haas
going
to
all
that
trouble
she
says
after
two
hours
handshaking
in
a
a
man
knows
what
real
trouble
is
she
stirred
around
and
around
the
cup
supping
up
spoonfuls
gratefully
i
sure
much
obliged
it
touches
the
right
spot
he
pressed
her
down
to
the
chair
seating
himself
on
the
low
edge
of
the
dais
now
you
sit
right
there
and
rest
your
bones
but
my
mother
haas
before
it
time
for
the
ride
home
she
must
rest
in
a
quiet
place
my
car
be
here
and
waiting
five
minutes
after
i
telephone
you
sure
have
been
grand
mr
haas
i
should
be
grand
yet
to
my
let
see
what
relation
is

to

poor
dead
sister
son

your
daughter

you
my
honest
haas
if

mama
she
says

want
i
do
mean
that
what
i
mean
i
wish
you
was
around
me
she
struck
him
then
with
her
fan
but
the
color
rose
up
into
the
mound
of
her
carefully
piled
hair
i
always
say
i
can
see
where
lester
gets
his
comical
ways
like
his
uncle
that
boy
keeps
us
all
laughing
gad
look
at
her
blush
i
know
women
your
age
would
give
fifty
dollars
a
blush
to
do
it
that
way
she
was
looking
away
again
shoulders
heaving
to
silent
laughter
the
blush
still
stinging
it
been
so
so
long
haas
since
i
had
compliments
made
to
me
you
make
me
feel
so
silly
i
know
it
you
nice
fine
woman

darn
shame

mean
it
i
hate
to
see
a
fine
woman
not
get
her
dues
anyways
when
she
the
finest
woman
of
them
all
i
the
woman
that
lives
to
see
a
day
like
this
her
daughter
the
happiest
girl
in
the
world
with
the
finest
boy
in
the
world

getting
her
dues

i

on
the
floor
stacks
up
like

about

up
for

hydrangea

leaned
down
into
the
recesses
of
the
black
grenadine
withdrawing
from
one
of
the
pockets
a
pair
of
spectacles
adjusting
them
with

difficulty

there
that
the
papers
to
a
succession
of
quick
knocks
she
flew
to
the
door
returning
with
the
folded
evening
editions
under
her
arm
now
she
cried
unfolding
and
inserting
the
first
of
them
into
the
quivering
hands
now
a
shawl
over
my
little
mama
knees
and
fixed
with
a
series
of
rapid
movements
she
flung
open
one
of
the
shawls
across
the
bed
folding
it
back
into
a
triangle
beside
the
table
bare
except
for
the
formal
unthumbed
bible
horowitz
rattled
out
a
paper
her
eyes
traveling
back
and
forth
across
the
page
music
from
the
orchestra
came
in
drifts
faint
not
so
faint
from
somewhere
then
immediately
from
everywhere
beyond
below
without
the
fast
shouts
of
newsboys
mingling
suddenly
and
of
her
own
volition
and
with
a
cry
that
shot
up
through
the
room
rending
it
like
a
gash
horowitz
who
moved
by
inches
sprang
to
her
supreme
height
her
arms
the
crooks
forced
out
flung
up
my
darlings
what
died
for
it
my
darlings
what
died
for
it
my
darlings
aylorff
my
husband
there
was
a
wail
rose
up
off
her
words
like
the
smoke
of
incense
curling
circling
around
her
my
darlings
what
died
to
make
free
mama
darling
mama
haas

mama
my
god
aylorff
my
husband
i
paid
with
my
blood
to
make
free
my
blood
my
son
my
own
immovable
there
her
arms
flung
up
and
tears
so
heavy
that
they
rolled
whole
from
her
face
down
to
the
black
grenadine
she
was
as
sonorous
as
the
tragic
meter
of
an
alexandrine
line
she
was
like
ruth
ancestress
of
heroes
and
progenitor
of
kings
my
boy
my
own
they
died
for
it
mann
mein
on
her
knees
frantic
to
press
her
down
once
more
into
the
chair
terrified
at
the
rigid
immobility
of
the
upright
figure
coblenz
paused
then
too
her
clasp
falling
away
and
leaned
forward
to
the
open
sheet
of
the
newspaper
its
black
facing
her
russia
free
bans
down
siberian
prisoners
liberated
in
her
ears
a
ringing
silence
as
if
a
great
steel
disk
had
clattered
down
into
the
depths
of
her
consciousness
there
on
her
knees
trembling
seized
her
and
she
hugged
herself
against
it
leaning
forward
to
corroborate
her
gaze
most
rigid
autocracy
in
the
world
overthrown
russia
rejoices

heavily

arm

gently
sustaining
horowitz
sank
rather
softly
down
her
eyelids
fluttering
for
the
moment
a
smile
had
come
out
on
her
face
and
as
her
head
sank
back
against
the
rest
the
eyes
resting
at
the
downward
flutter
she
gave
out
a
long
breath
not
taking
it
in
again
mama
you
fainting
she
leaned
to
her
shaking
the
relaxed
figure
by
the
elbows
her
face
almost
touching
the
one
with
the
smile
lying
so
deeply
into
it

shaking
at
that
quiet
form
sobs
that
were
full
of
voice
tearing
raw
from
her
throat
she
fell
to
kissing
the
sunken
face
enclosing
it
stroking
it
holding
her
streaming
gaze
closely
and
burningly
against
the
closed
lids
