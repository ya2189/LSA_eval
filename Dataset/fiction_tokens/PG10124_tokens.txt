introducing
mumbles
major
gregory
doyle
paced
nervously
up
and
down
the
floor
of
the
cosy
sitting
room
something
surely
happened
to
our
patsy
he
exclaimed
a
little
man
with
a
calm
face
and
a
bald
head
who
was
seated
near
the
fire
continued
to
read
his
newspaper
and
paid
no
attention
to
the
outburst
something
has
happened
to
patsy
repeated
the
major
patsy
meaning
his
own
and
only
daughter
patricia
something
is
always
happening
to
everyone
said
the
little
man
turning
his
paper
indifferently
something
is
happening
to
me
for
i
ca
find
the
rest
of
this
article
something
is
happening
to
you
for
you
losing
your
temper
i
not
sir
i
deny
it
as
for
patsy
continued
the
other
she
is
sixteen
years
old
and
knows
new
york
like
a
book
the
girl
is
safe
enough
then
where
is
she
tell
me
that
sir
here
it
is
seven
dark
as
pitch
and
raining
hard
and
patsy
is
never
out
after
six
can
you
john
merrick
sit
there
like
a
lump
o
putty
and
do
nothing
when
your
niece
and
my
own
darlin
patsy
is
lost
or
strayed
or
stolen
what
would
you
propose
doing
asked
uncle
john
looking
up
with
a
smile
we
ought
to
get
out
the
police
department
it
raining
and
cold
and
then
we
ought
to
get
out
the
fire
department
call
mary
to
put
on
more
coal
and
let
have
it
warm
and
cheerful
when
patsy
comes
in
but
sir
the
trouble
with
you
major
is
that
dinner
is
half
an
hour
late
one
can
imagine
all
sorts
of
horrible
things
on
an
empty
stomach
now
then
he
paused
for
a
rattled
in
the
hall
door
and
a
moment
later
patsy
doyle
rosy
and
animated
fresh
from
the
cold
and
wet
outside
smilingly
greeted
them
she
had
an
umbrella
but
her
cloak
was
dripping
with
moisture
and
in
its
ample
folds
was
something
huddled
and
bundled
up
like
a
baby
which
she
carefully
protected
so
then
exclaimed
the
major
coming
forward
for
a
kiss
back
at
last
safe
and
sound
whatever
kept
ye
out
this
time
night
patsy
darlin
he
added
letting
the
brogue
creep
into
his
tone
as
he
did
when
stirred
by
any
emotion
uncle
john
started
to
take
off
her
wet
cloak
look
out
cried
patsy
you
disturb
mumbles
the
two
men
looked
at
her
bundle
curiously
who
mumbles
asked
one
what
on
earth
is
mumbles
inquired
the
other
the
bundle
squirmed
and
wriggled
patsy
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
carefully
unwound
the
folds
of
the
cloak
a
tiny
dog
black
and
shaggy
put
his
head
out
blinked
sleepily
at
the
lights
pulled
his
fat
shapeless
body
away
from
the
bandages
and
trotted
solemnly
over
to
the
fireplace
he
did
travel
straight
ahead
as
dogs
ought
to
walk
but
cornerwise
as
patsy
described
it
and
when
he
got
to
the
hearth
he
rolled
himself
into
a
ball
lay
down
and
went
to
sleep
during
this
performance
a
tense
silence
had
pervaded
the
room
the
major
looked
at
the
dog
rather
gloomily
uncle
john
with
critical
eyes
that
held
a
smile
in
them
patsy
with
ecstatic
delight
is
he
a
dear
she
exclaimed
it
occurs
to
me
said
the
major
stiffly
that
this
needs
an
explanation
do
you
mean
to
say
patsy
doyle
that
you
worried
the
hearts
out
of
us
this
past
hour
and
kept
the
dinner
waiting
all
because
of
a
scurvy
bit
of
an
animal
pshaw
said
uncle
john
speak
for
yourself
major
i
was
worried
a
bit
you
see
explained
patsy
rising
to
take
off
her
things
and
put
them
away
i
was
coming
home
early
when
i
first
met
mumbles
a
little
boy
had
him
with
a
string
tied
around
his
neck
and
when
mumbles
tried
to
run
up
to
me
the
boy
jerked
him
back
cruelly
and
afterward
kicked
him
that
made
me
mad
of
course
said
uncle
john
nodding
wisely
i
cuffed
the
boy
and
he
said
he
take
it
out
on
mumbles
as
soon
as
i
gone
away
i
did
like
that
i
offered
to
buy
the
dog
but
the
boy
did
dare
sell
him
he
said
it
belonged
to
his
father
kill
him
and
kick
up
a
row
besides
if
he
did
bring
mumbles
home
so
i
found
out
where
they
lived
and
as
it
was
far
away
i
went
home
with
him
crazy
patsy
smiled
uncle
john
and
the
dinner
waiting
groaned
the
major
reproachfully
well
i
had
a
time
you
can
believe
continued
patsy
with
animation
the
man
was
a
big
brute
and
half
drunk
he
grabbed
up
the
little
doggie
and
threw
it
into
a
box
and
then
told
me
to
go
home
and
mind
my
business
which
of
course
you
refused
to
do
of
course
i
made
up
my
mind
to
have
that
dog
dogs
said
the
major
invariably
are
nuisances
not
invariably
declared
patsy
mumbles
is
different
mumbles
is
a
good
doggie
and
wise
and
knowing
although
he
only
a
baby
dog
yet
and
i
just
could
leave
him
to
be
cuffed
and
kicked
and
thrown
around
by
those
brutes
when
the
man
found
i
was
determined
to
have
mumbles
he
demanded
dollars
dollars
it
startled
uncle
john
for
that
bit
of
rags
and
meat
asked
the
major
looking
at
the
puppy
with
disfavor
cents
would
be
exorbitant
the
man
misjudged
me
observed
patsy
with
a
merry
laugh
that
matched
her
twinkling
blue
eyes
in
the
end
he
got
just
two
dollars
for
mumbles
and
when
i
came
away
he
bade
me
very
respectfully
the
boy
howled
he
has
any
dog
to
kick
and
is
as
for
mumbles
he
going
to
lead
a
respectable
life
and
be
treated
like
a
dog
do
you
mean
to
keep
him
inquired
the
major
why
not
said
patsy
do
you
like
him
daddy
her
father
turned
mumbles
over
with
his
toe
the
puppy
lay
upon
its
back
lazily
with
all
four
paws
in
the
air
and
cast
a
comical
glance
from
one
beady
bright
eye
at
the
man
who
had
disturbed
him
the
major
sighed
he
ca
hunt
patsy
he
not
even
a
mouser
we
have
a
mouse
in
the
house
he
neither
useful
nor
ornamental
from
the
looks
o
the
beast
only
good
to
sleep
and
eat
what
the
odds
laughed
patsy
coddling
mumbles
up
in
her
arms
we
do
expect
use
or
ornamentation
from
mumbles
all
we
ask
is
his
companionship
mary
called
them
to
dinner
just
then
and
the
girl
hurried
to
her
room
to
make
a
hasty
toilet
while
the
men
sat
down
at
the
table
and
eyed
their
soup
reflectively
this
addition
to
the
family
remarked
uncle
john
need
not
make
you
at
all
unhappy
my
dear
major
do
get
jealous
of
mumbles
for
heaven
sake
for
the
little
brute
may
add
a
bit
to
patsy
bliss
it
the
first
time
i
ever
allowed
a
dog
in
the
house
you
are
not
running
this
present
establishment
it
belongs
exclusively
to
patsy
i
always
hated
the
sight
of
a
woman
coddling
a
dog
added
the
major
frowning
i
know
i
feel
the
same
way
myself
but
it
is
the
dog
fault
it
the
woman
and
patsy
wo
make
a
fool
of
herself
over
that
frowsy
puppy
i
assure
you
on
the
contrary
she
likely
to
get
a
lot
of
joy
out
of
her
new
plaything
and
if
you
really
want
to
make
her
happy
major
do
discourage
this
new
whim
absurd
as
it
seems
let
patsy
alone
and
let
mumbles
alone
the
girl
came
in
just
then
bringing
sunshine
with
her
patsy
doyle
was
not
very
big
for
her
years
and
some
people
unkindly
described
her
form
as
chubby
she
had
glorious
red
hair
red
and
her
blue
eyes
were
the
merriest
sweetest
eyes
any
girl
could
possess
you
seldom
noticed
her
freckles
her
saucy
chin
or
her
nose
you
only
saw
the
laughing
eyes
and
crown
of
golden
red
and
seeing
them
you
liked
patsy
doyle
at
once
and
imagined
she
was
very
good
to
look
at
if
not
strictly
beautiful
no
one
had
friends
more
loyal
and
these
two
old
men
the
stately
major
and
round
little
uncle
john
fairly
worshiped
patsy
no
one
might
suspect
from
the
simple
life
of
this
household
which
occupied
the
second
corner
flat
at
willing
square
that
miss
doyle
was
an
heiress
not
only
that
but
perhaps
one
of
the
very
richest
girls
in
new
york
and
the
reason
is
readily
explained
when
i
state
the
fact
that
patsy
uncle
john
merrick
the
round
little
man
who
sat
contentedly
eating
his
soup
was
a
man
of
many
millions
and
this
girl
his
favorite
niece
an
old
bachelor
who
had
acquired
an
immense
fortune
in
the
far
northwest
merrick
had
lately
retired
from
active
business
and
come
east
to
seek
any
relatives
that
might
remain
to
him
after
forty
years
absence
his
sister
jane
had
gathered
around
her
three
nieces
louise
merrick
elizabeth
de
graf
and
patricia
doyle
and
when
aunt
jane
died
uncle
john
adopted
these
three
girls
and
made
their
happiness
the
one
care
of
his
jolly
unselfish
life
at
that
time
major
doyle
patsy
only
surviving
parent
was
a
poor
bookkeeper
but
uncle
john
gave
him
charge
of
his
vast
property
interests
and
loving
patsy
almost
as
devotedly
as
did
her
father
made
his
home
with
the
doyles
and
began
to
enjoy
himself
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
at
the
period
when
this
story
opens
the
eldest
niece
louise
merrick
had
just
been
married
to
arthur
weldon
a
prosperous
young
business
man
and
the
remaining
two
nieces
as
well
as
uncle
john
were
feeling
rather
lonely
and
depressed
the
bride
had
been
gone
on
her
honeymoon
three
days
and
during
the
last
two
days
it
had
rained
persistently
so
until
patsy
came
home
from
a
visit
to
beth
and
brought
the
tiny
dog
with
her
the
two
old
gentlemen
had
been
feeling
dreary
enough
patsy
always
livened
things
up
nothing
could
really
depress
this
spirited
girl
for
long
and
she
was
always
doing
some
interesting
thing
to
create
a
little
excitement
if
she
had
bought
a
cent
pup
for
two
dollars
remarked
the
major
she
might
have
brought
home
an
orphan
from
the
gutters
or
a
litter
of
tomcats
or
one
of
the
goats
that
eat
the
tin
cans
at
harlem
perhaps
after
all
we
should
be
thankful
only
what
his
name
mumbles
said
patsy
merrily
the
boy
said
they
called
him
that
because
he
mumbled
in
his
sleep
listen
indeed
the
small
waif
by
the
fire
was
emitting
a
series
of
noises
that
seemed
a
queer
mixture
of
low
growls
and
whines
evidence
unimpeachable
that
he
had
been
correctly
named
at
patsy
shout
of
laughter
supplemented
by
uncle
john
chuckles
and
a
reproachful
cough
from
the
major
mumbles
awakened
and
lifted
his
head
it
may
be
an
eye
discovered
the
in
the
next
room
or
an
intuitive
sense
of
smell
directed
him
for
presently
the
small
animal
came
trotting
in
still
traveling
cornerwise
and
sat
up
on
his
hind
legs
just
beside
patsy
chair
that
settles
it
said
the
major
as
his
daughter
began
feeding
the
dog
our
happy
home
is
broken
up
perhaps
not
suggested
uncle
john
reaching
out
to
pat
the
soft
head
of
mumbles
it
may
be
the
little
beggar
will
liven
us
all
up
a
bit
chapter
ii
uncle
john
idea
two
hours
later
uncle
john
who
had
been
dozing
in
his
big
chair
by
the
fire
while
patsy
drummed
on
the
piano
sat
up
abruptly
and
looked
around
him
with
a
suddenly
acquired
air
of
decision
i
have
an
idea
he
announced
did
you
find
it
in
your
dreams
then
asked
the
major
sharply
why
daddy
how
cross
you
are
cried
patsy
ca
uncle
john
have
an
idea
if
he
wants
to
i
afraid
of
his
ideas
admitted
the
major
suspiciously
every
time
he
goes
to
sleep
and
catches
a
thought
it
means
trouble
patsy
laughed
looking
at
her
uncle
curiously
and
the
little
man
smiled
at
her
genially
in
return
it
takes
me
a
long
time
to
figure
a
thing
out
he
said
and
when
i
a
problem
to
solve
a
bit
of
a
snooze
helps
wonderfully
patsy
dear
it
occurs
to
me
we
lonely
we
surely
are
uncle
she
exclaimed
and
in
the
dumps
our
spirits
are
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottomless
pit
so
what
we
need
is
a
change
there
it
goes
said
the
major
ruefully
i
knew
very
well
any
idea
of
john
merrick
would
cause
us
misery
but
understand
this
you
miserable
sir
my
daughter
patsy
steps
not
one
foot
out
of
new
york
this
winter
why
not
mildly
inquired
uncle
john
because
you
spirited
her
away
from
me
times
enough
and
deprived
her
only
parent
of
her
society
first
you
gallivanted
off
to
europe
and
then
to
millville
and
next
to
elmhurst
so
now
egad
i
going
to
keep
the
girl
with
me
if
i
have
to
throttle
every
idea
in
your
wicked
old
head
but
i
planning
to
take
you
along
this
time
major
observed
uncle
john
reflectively
oh
hum
well
i
ca
go
there
too
much
business
to
be
attended
to
looking
after
your
horrible
money
take
a
vacation
you
know
i
do
care
anything
about
the
business
it
ca
go
very
wrong
anyhow
what
does
it
matter
if
my
income
invested
properly
or
the
bond
coupons
cut
when
they
due
drat
the
money
that
what
i
say
added
patsy
eagerly
be
a
man
major
doyle
and
put
the
business
out
of
your
mind
let
go
somewhere
and
have
a
good
romp
it
will
cheer
us
up
the
major
stared
first
at
one
and
then
at
the
other
what
the
programme
john
he
asked
stiffly
it
going
to
be
a
cold
winter
remarked
the
little
man
bobbing
his
head
up
and
down
slowly
it
is
cried
patsy
clasping
her
hands
fervently
i
can
feel
it
in
my
bones
so
we
going
said
uncle
john
impressively
to
california
where
they
grow
sunshine
and
roses
to
offset
our
blizzards
and
icicles
hurray
shouted
patsy
i
always
wanted
to
go
to
california
california
said
the
major
amazed
why
it
farther
away
than
europe
it
takes
a
month
to
get
there
nonsense
retorted
uncle
john
it
only
four
days
from
coast
to
coast
i
have
a
somewhere
and
he
began
searching
in
his
pockets
there
was
a
silence
oppressive
on
the
major
part
ecstatic
as
far
as
patsy
was
concerned
uncle
john
found
the
railway
folder
put
on
his
spectacles
and
began
to
examine
it
at
my
time
of
life
remarked
major
doyle
who
was
hale
and
hearty
as
a
boy
such
a
trip
is
a
great
undertaking
hours
to
chicago
muttered
uncle
john
and
then
three
days
to
los
angeles
or
san
francisco
that
all
there
is
to
it
four
days
and
four
nights
of
dreary
riding
we
be
dead
by
that
time
prophesied
the
major
uncle
john
looked
thoughtful
then
he
lay
back
in
his
chair
and
spread
his
handkerchief
over
his
face
again
no
no
cried
the
major
in
alarm
for
mercy
sake
john
go
to
sleep
and
catch
any
more
of
those
terrible
ideas
no
one
knows
where
the
next
one
might
carry
us
to
timbuktu
or
yucatan
probably
let
stick
to
california
and
settle
the
question
before
your
hothouse
brain
grows
any
more
weeds
yucatan
remarked
merrick
composedly
his
voice
muffled
by
the
handkerchief
is
a
bad
suggestion
i
knew
it
wailed
the
major
how
would
ethiopia
or
hindustan
strike
you
patsy
laughed
at
him
she
knew
something
good
was
in
store
for
her
and
like
all
girls
was
enraptured
at
the
thought
of
visiting
new
and
interesting
scenes
do
bother
uncle
john
daddy
she
said
you
know
very
well
he
will
carry
out
any
whim
that
seizes
him
especially
if
you
oppose
the
plan
which
you
usually
do
he
the
most
erratic
and
irresponsible
man
that
ever
lived
announced
her
father
staring
moodily
at
the
spread
handkerchief
which
covered
uncle
john
features
new
york
is
good
enough
for
anybody
even
in
winter
and
now
that
you
in
society
patsy
oh
bother
society
i
hate
it
true
he
agreed
it
a
regular
treadmill
when
it
has
enslaved
one
and
keeps
you
going
on
and
on
without
progressing
a
bit
the
object
of
society
is
to
tire
you
out
and
keep
you
from
indulging
in
any
other
occupation
you
know
nothing
about
it
observed
patsy
demurely
and
that
is
why
you
love
to
rail
at
society
the
things
you
know
daddy
dear
are
the
things
you
never
remark
upon
huh
grunted
the
major
and
relapsed
into
silence
mumbles
had
finished
his
nap
and
was
now
awakening
to
activity
this
dog
size
according
to
the
major
was
about
but
you
ca
tell
which
is
the
and
which
the
he
was
distressingly
shaggy
patsy
could
find
the
stump
of
his
tail
only
by
careful
search
seldom
were
both
eyes
uncovered
by
hair
at
the
same
time
but
as
his
new
mistress
had
said
he
was
a
wise
little
dog
for
one
who
had
only
known
the
world
for
a
few
months
and
his
brain
was
exceedingly
alert
after
yawning
at
the
fire
he
rubbed
his
back
against
the
major
legs
sat
up
beside
patsy
and
looked
at
her
from
one
eye
pleadingly
next
he
trotted
over
to
uncle
john
the
big
white
handkerchief
attracted
him
and
one
corner
hung
down
from
the
edge
of
the
reclining
chair
mumbles
sat
up
and
reached
for
it
but
could
not
quite
get
it
in
his
teeth
so
he
sat
down
and
thought
it
over
and
presently
made
a
leap
so
unexpectedly
agile
that
patsy
roared
with
merriment
and
even
the
major
grinned
uncle
john
aroused
sat
up
and
found
the
puppy
rolling
on
the
floor
and
fighting
the
handkerchief
as
if
it
had
been
some
deadly
foe
thank
goodness
sighed
the
major
the
little
black
rascal
has
providently
prevented
you
from
evolving
another
idea
not
so
responded
merrick
amiably
i
thought
the
thing
all
out
and
completed
our
programme
is
it
still
to
be
california
anxiously
inquired
patsy
of
course
i
ca
give
up
the
sunshine
and
roses
you
know
but
we
wo
bore
the
major
by
four
solid
days
of
railway
travel
we
break
the
journey
and
take
two
or
three
weeks
to
it
perhaps
a
month
conquering
caesar
a
month
ejaculated
the
old
soldier
a
desperate
look
on
his
face
yes
listen
both
of
you
we
get
to
chicago
in
a
night
and
a
day
we
will
stop
off
there
and
visit
the
stockyards
and
collect
a
few
squeals
for
souvenirs
no
we
wo
declared
patsy
positively
we
might
sell
mumbles
to
some
chicago
sausage
factory
remarked
the
major
but
not
for
two
whole
dollars
he
would
make
more
than
half
a
pound
at
twenty
cents
the
pound
there
are
other
sights
to
be
seen
in
chicago
continued
uncle
john
anyhow
we
stop
off
long
enough
to
get
rested
then
on
to
denver
and
pike
peak
that
sounds
good
said
patsy
at
denver
said
uncle
john
we
will
take
a
touring
car
and
cross
the
mountains
in
it
there
are
good
roads
all
the
way
from
there
to
california
who
told
you
so
demanded
the
major
no
one
it
a
logical
conclusion
for
i
lived
in
the
west
and
know
the
prairie
roads
are
smoother
than
boulevards
however
haggerty
told
me
the
other
day
that
he
has
made
the
trip
from
denver
to
los
angeles
by
automobile
and
what
others
can
do
we
can
do
it
will
be
glorious
prophesied
patsy
delightedly
the
major
looked
grave
but
could
find
no
plausible
objection
to
offer
he
really
knew
nothing
about
the
west
and
had
never
had
occasion
to
consider
such
a
proposition
before
we
talk
to
haggerty
he
said
but
you
must
remember
he
a
desperate
liar
john
and
ca
be
trusted
as
a
guidepost
when
do
you
intend
to
start
why
not
asked
uncle
john
mildly
even
patsy
demurred
at
this
why
we
got
to
get
ready
uncle
she
said
and
who
going
just
we
three
we
will
take
beth
along
of
course
beth
was
elizabeth
de
graf
another
niece
but
beth
is
fortunately
the
sort
of
girl
who
can
pull
up
stakes
and
move
on
at
an
hour
notice
beth
is
always
ready
for
anything
agreed
patsy
but
if
we
are
going
to
a
warm
climate
we
will
need
summer
clothes
you
ca
lug
many
clothes
in
a
motor
car
observed
the
major
no
but
we
can
ship
them
on
ahead
haggerty
says
remarked
uncle
john
that
you
wo
need
thin
clothes
until
you
get
out
to
california
in
fact
the
mountain
trip
is
rather
cool
but
it
perpetual
sunshine
you
know
even
there
with
brisk
keen
air
and
the
whole
journey
haggerty
says
is
one
of
absolute
delight
who
is
haggerty
asked
patsy
a
liar
answered
the
major
positively
he
a
very
good
fellow
whom
we
sometimes
meet
in
the
city
said
uncle
john
haggerty
is
on
the
board
and
director
in
a
bank
or
two
and
quite
respectable
but
the
major
the
major
going
to
california
just
to
prove
that
haggerty
speak
the
truth
observed
that
gentleman
tersely
heading
off
any
threatened
criticism
i
see
there
is
no
opposing
your
preposterous
scheme
john
so
we
will
go
with
you
and
make
the
best
of
it
but
sure
it
all
a
sad
mistake
what
else
did
haggerty
tell
you
he
says
it
best
to
pick
up
a
motor
car
and
a
chauffeur
in
denver
rather
than
ship
them
on
from
here
there
are
plenty
of
cars
to
be
had
and
men
who
know
every
inch
of
the
road
that
seems
sensible
declared
patsy
and
we
wo
lose
time
waiting
for
our
own
car
to
follow
by
freight
i
think
uncle
john
i
can
be
ready
by
next
tuesday
why
saturday
gasped
the
major
the
business
cut
the
business
off
short
suggested
his
you
to
cut
it
somewhere
you
know
or
you
never
get
away
and
as
it
my
business
i
hereby
authorize
you
to
neglect
it
from
this
moment
until
the
day
of
our
return
when
we
get
back
you
can
pick
up
the
details
again
and
worry
over
it
as
much
as
you
please
will
we
ever
get
back
asked
the
major
doubtingly
if
we
do
the
business
wo
matter
that
the
idea
cried
patsy
approvingly
daddy
has
worked
hard
all
summer
uncle
john
looking
after
that
annoying
money
of
yours
and
a
vacation
will
do
him
oodles
of
good
major
doyle
sighed
i
misdoubt
the
wisdom
of
the
trip
said
he
but
i
go
of
course
if
you
all
insist
over
the
rocky
mountains
and
across
the
great
american
desert
in
an
automobile
does
sound
very
enticing
but
haggerty
says
never
mind
haggerty
we
find
out
for
ourselves
and
after
all
said
patsy
there
are
the
sunshine
and
roses
at
the
end
of
the
journey
and
they
ought
to
make
up
for
any
amount
of
bother
in
getting
there
girl
you
attempting
to
deceive
me
to
deceive
your
old
daddy
said
the
major
shaking
his
head
at
her
you
would
have
any
fun
riding
to
california
in
a
palace
car
even
the
sunshine
and
roses
could
excite
you
under
such
circumstances
but
if
there
a
chance
for
adventure
a
chance
to
slide
into
trouble
and
make
a
mighty
struggle
to
get
out
again
both
you
and
that
wicked
old
uncle
of
yours
will
jump
at
it
i
know
ye
both
and
that
the
real
reason
going
to
travel
in
an
automobile
instead
of
progressing
comfortably
as
all
respectable
people
do
you
a
humbug
retorted
merrick
you
would
go
by
train
if
i
let
you
no
admitted
the
major
i
must
be
on
hand
to
rescue
you
when
you
and
patsy
go
fighting
windmills
chapter
iii
myrtle
dean
we
were
due
in
denver
three
hours
ago
and
it
an
hour
run
or
more
yet
remarked
beth
de
graf
walking
briskly
up
and
down
the
platform
of
a
way
station
where
the
train
had
stopped
for
orders
and
it
beginning
to
snow
observed
patricia
doyle
beside
her
i
afraid
this
weather
is
very
propitious
for
an
automobile
trip
uncle
john
does
worry
said
beth
he
believes
there
is
perpetual
sunshine
west
of
denver
yes
a
man
named
haggerty
told
him
but
you
notice
that
daddy
does
seem
to
believe
the
tale
anyhow
we
shall
soon
know
the
truth
beth
and
the
trip
is
somewhat
on
the
order
of
a
voyage
of
discovery
which
renders
it
fascinating
to
look
forward
to
there
is
such
fun
in
not
knowing
just
what
is
going
to
happen
next
when
one
travels
with
uncle
john
returned
beth
smiling
she
knows
exactly
nothing
that
is
why
i
am
always
eager
to
accept
if
he
invites
me
to
go
anywhere
with
him
the
passengers
thronging
the
platform
stretching
their
legs
after
the
confinement
of
the
tedious
railway
journey
eyed
these
two
girls
admiringly
beth
was
admitted
a
beauty
and
one
of
the
society
journals
had
lately
announced
that
she
had
few
peers
in
all
the
great
metropolis
chestnut
brown
hair
dark
serious
and
steady
eyes
an
exquisite
complexion
and
rarely
regular
features
all
conspired
to
render
the
young
girl
wonderfully
attractive
her
stride
was
athletic
free
and
graceful
her
slender
form
well
poised
and
dignified
patsy
the
as
she
called
herself
was
so
bright
and
animated
and
her
blue
eyes
sparkled
so
constantly
with
fun
and
good
humor
that
she
attracted
fully
as
much
attention
as
her
more
sedate
and
more
beautiful
cousin
and
wherever
she
went
was
sure
to
make
a
host
of
friends
see
she
cried
clasping
beth
arm
there
is
that
lovely
girl
at
the
window
again
i
noticed
her
ever
since
the
train
left
chicago
and
she
is
always
in
the
same
seat
in
that
tourist
coach
i
wonder
why
she
does
get
out
for
a
bit
of
fresh
air
now
and
then
beth
looked
up
at
the
fair
girlish
face
that
gazed
wistfully
from
the
window
the
unknown
seemed
very
young
not
more
than
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
of
age
she
wore
a
blue
serge
suit
of
rather
coarse
weave
but
it
was
neat
and
becoming
around
the
modest
sweet
eyes
were
deep
circles
denoting
physical
suffering
or
prolonged
worry
yet
the
lips
smiled
wanly
but
persistently
she
had
evidently
noticed
uncle
john
two
nieces
for
her
eyes
followed
them
as
they
marched
up
and
down
the
platform
and
when
patsy
looked
up
and
nodded
a
soft
flush
suffused
her
features
and
she
bowed
her
head
in
return
at
the
cry
of
all
aboard
a
scramble
was
made
for
the
coaches
and
beth
and
patsy
their
staterooms
found
their
uncle
and
the
major
still
intent
upon
their
interminable
game
of
cribbage
let
go
back
and
talk
to
the
girl
suggested
patsy
somehow
the
poor
thing
seems
lonely
and
her
smile
was
more
pathetic
than
cheerful
so
they
made
their
way
through
the
long
train
to
the
tourist
coach
and
there
found
the
girl
they
were
seeking
the
surrounding
seats
were
occupied
by
groups
of
passengers
of
rather
coarse
caliber
many
being
foreign
laborers
accompanied
by
their
wives
and
children
the
air
in
the
car
was
close
and
stuffy
and
the
passengers
seemed
none
too
neat
in
their
habits
and
appearance
so
the
solitary
girl
appeared
like
a
rose
blooming
in
a
barnyard
and
her
two
visitors
were
instantly
sorry
for
her
she
sat
in
her
corner
leaning
wearily
against
the
back
of
the
cane
seat
with
a
blanket
spread
over
her
lap
strangely
enough
the
consideration
of
her
fellow
passengers
left
the
girl
in
undisturbed
possession
of
a
double
seat
perhaps
she
is
ill
thought
patsy
as
she
and
beth
sat
down
opposite
and
entered
into
conversation
with
the
child
she
was
frankly
communicative
and
they
soon
learned
that
her
name
was
myrtle
dean
and
that
she
was
an
orphan
although
scarcely
fifteen
years
of
age
she
had
for
more
than
two
years
gained
a
livelihood
by
working
in
a
skirt
factory
in
chicago
paying
her
board
regularly
to
a
cross
old
aunt
who
was
her
only
relative
in
the
big
city
three
months
ago
however
she
had
met
with
an
accident
having
been
knocked
down
by
an
automobile
while
going
to
her
work
and
seriously
injured
the
doctors
say
she
confided
to
her
new
friends
that
i
shall
always
be
lame
although
not
quite
helpless
indeed
i
can
creep
around
a
little
now
when
i
am
obliged
to
move
and
i
shall
get
better
every
day
one
of
my
hips
was
so
badly
injured
that
it
will
never
be
quite
right
again
and
my
aunt
martha
was
dreadfully
worried
for
fear
i
would
become
a
tax
upon
her
i
can
not
blame
her
for
she
has
really
but
little
money
to
pay
for
her
own
support
so
when
the
man
who
ran
over
me
paid
us
a
hundred
dollars
for
damages
only
a
hundred
dollars
cried
beth
amazed
was
that
enough
inquired
myrtle
innocently
by
no
means
said
patsy
with
prompt
indignation
he
should
have
given
you
five
thousand
at
least
do
you
realize
my
dear
that
this
accident
has
probably
deprived
you
of
the
means
of
earning
a
livelihood
i
can
still
sew
returned
the
girl
courageously
although
of
course
i
can
not
get
about
easily
to
search
for
employment
but
why
did
you
leave
chicago
asked
beth
i
was
coming
to
that
part
of
my
story
when
i
got
the
hundred
dollars
aunt
martha
decided
i
must
use
it
to
go
to
leadville
to
my
uncle
anson
who
is
my
mother
only
brother
he
is
a
miner
out
there
and
aunt
martha
says
he
is
quite
able
to
take
care
of
me
so
she
bought
my
ticket
and
put
me
on
the
train
and
i
now
on
my
way
to
leadville
to
find
uncle
anson
to
him
exclaimed
patsy
do
you
know
his
address
no
we
have
had
a
letter
from
him
for
two
years
but
aunt
martha
says
he
must
be
a
prominent
man
and
everybody
in
leadville
will
know
him
as
it
a
small
place
does
he
know
you
are
coming
asked
beth
thoughtfully
my
aunt
wrote
him
a
letter
two
days
before
i
started
so
he
ought
to
receive
it
two
days
before
i
get
there
replied
myrtle
a
little
uneasily
of
course
i
ca
help
worrying
some
because
if
i
failed
to
find
uncle
anson
i
do
know
what
might
happen
to
me
have
you
money
asked
beth
a
little
about
three
dollars
aunt
gave
me
a
basket
of
food
to
last
until
i
get
to
leadville
and
after
paying
for
my
ticket
and
taking
what
i
owed
her
for
board
there
was
much
left
from
the
hundred
dollars
what
a
cruel
old
woman
cried
patsy
wrathfully
she
ought
to
be
horsewhipped
i
am
sure
it
was
wrong
for
her
to
cast
you
off
in
this
heartless
way
added
beth
more
conservatively
she
is
not
really
bad
returned
myrtle
the
tears
starting
to
her
eyes
but
aunt
martha
has
grown
selfish
and
does
not
care
for
me
very
much
i
hope
uncle
anson
will
be
different
he
is
my
brother
you
know
while
aunt
martha
is
only
my
father
sister
and
an
old
maid
who
has
had
rather
a
hard
life
perhaps
she
added
wistfully
uncle
anson
will
love
me
although
i
not
strong
or
well
both
patsy
and
beth
felt
desperately
sorry
for
the
girl
what
is
uncle
anson
other
name
asked
the
latter
for
beth
was
the
more
practical
of
uncle
john
nieces
and
noted
for
her
clear
thinking
jones
anson
jones
rather
a
common
name
if
you
have
to
hunt
for
him
observed
the
questioner
musingly
has
he
been
in
leadville
long
i
do
not
know
replied
myrtle
his
last
letter
proved
that
he
was
in
leadville
two
years
ago
and
he
said
he
had
been
very
successful
and
made
money
but
he
has
been
in
other
mining
camps
i
know
and
has
wandered
for
years
all
over
the
west
suppose
he
should
be
wandering
now
suggested
patsy
but
at
the
look
of
alarm
on
myrtle
face
she
quickly
changed
the
subject
saying
you
must
come
in
to
dinner
with
us
my
dear
for
you
have
had
nothing
but
cold
truck
to
eat
since
you
left
chicago
they
say
we
shall
be
in
denver
in
another
hour
but
i
afraid
to
believe
it
anyhow
there
is
plenty
of
time
for
dinner
oh
i
ca
go
really
cried
the
girl
it
it
so
hard
for
me
to
walk
when
the
train
is
moving
and
and
i
would
feel
happy
in
that
gay
luxurious
dining
car
well
we
must
go
anyway
or
the
major
will
be
very
disagreeable
said
patsy
myrtle
we
shall
see
you
again
before
we
leave
the
train
as
the
two
girls
went
forward
to
their
coach
beth
said
to
patsy
i
afraid
that
poor
thing
will
be
greatly
disappointed
when
she
gets
to
leadville
imagine
anyone
sending
a
child
on
such
a
wild
goose
chase
and
an
injured
and
almost
helpless
child
at
that
i
shudder
to
think
what
would
become
of
her
with
no
uncle
to
care
for
her
and
only
three
dollars
to
her
name
added
patsy
i
have
never
heard
of
such
an
inhuman
creature
as
that
aunt
martha
beth
i
hope
there
are
not
many
like
her
in
the
world
at
dinner
they
arranged
with
the
head
waiter
of
the
dining
car
to
send
in
a
substantial
meal
smoking
hot
to
myrtle
dean
and
patsy
herself
inspected
the
tray
before
it
went
to
make
sure
everything
was
there
that
was
ordered
they
had
to
satisfy
uncle
john
curiosity
at
this
proceeding
by
relating
to
him
myrtle
dean
story
and
the
kindly
little
man
became
very
thoughtful
and
agreed
with
them
that
it
was
a
cruel
act
to
send
the
poor
girl
into
a
strange
country
in
search
of
an
uncle
who
had
not
been
heard
of
in
two
years
when
the
train
pulled
into
the
station
at
denver
the
first
care
of
john
merrick
party
was
to
look
after
the
welfare
of
the
lame
girl
they
got
a
porter
to
assist
her
into
the
depot
waiting
room
and
then
uncle
john
inquired
about
the
next
train
for
leadville
and
found
it
would
not
start
until
the
following
morning
the
late
overland
train
having
missed
that
day
connections
this
was
a
serious
discovery
for
poor
myrtle
but
she
smiled
bravely
and
said
i
can
pass
the
night
in
this
seat
very
comfortably
so
please
worry
about
me
it
is
warm
here
you
know
and
i
wo
mind
a
bit
the
sitting
up
thank
you
all
very
much
for
your
kindness
and
i
be
all
right
never
fear
uncle
john
stood
looking
down
at
her
thoughtfully
did
you
engage
a
carriage
major
he
asked
yes
there
one
now
waiting
was
the
reply
all
right
now
then
my
dear
let
wrap
this
blanket
around
you
tight
and
snug
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
myrtle
with
a
startled
look
carry
you
outside
it
pretty
cold
and
snowy
so
we
must
wrap
you
up
now
major
take
hold
on
the
other
side
here
we
go
patsy
smiled
rather
pitifully
at
the
expression
of
bewilderment
on
myrtle
face
uncle
john
and
the
major
carried
her
tenderly
to
a
carriage
and
put
her
in
the
back
seat
patsy
sprang
in
next
with
mumbles
clasped
tightly
in
her
arms
the
small
dog
having
been
forced
to
make
the
journey
thus
far
in
the
baggage
car
beth
and
the
major
entered
the
carriage
next
while
uncle
john
mounted
beside
the
driver
and
directed
him
to
the
crown
palace
hotel
it
was
growing
dark
when
they
reached
the
dingy
hostelry
which
might
have
been
palatial
when
it
was
named
but
was
now
sadly
faded
and
tawdry
it
proved
to
be
fairly
comfortable
however
and
the
first
care
of
the
party
was
to
see
myrtle
dean
safely
established
in
a
cosy
room
with
a
grate
fire
to
cheer
her
patsy
and
beth
had
adjoining
rooms
and
kept
running
in
for
a
word
with
their
protégé
who
was
so
astonished
and
confused
by
her
sudden
good
fortune
that
she
was
incapable
of
speech
and
more
inclined
to
cry
than
to
laugh
during
the
evening
uncle
john
was
busy
at
the
telegraph
booth
he
sent
several
messages
to
leadville
to
anson
jones
to
the
chief
of
police
and
to
the
various
hotels
but
long
before
midnight
when
the
last
replies
were
received
he
knew
that
anson
jones
had
left
leadville
five
months
ago
and
his
present
whereabouts
were
unknown
having
learned
these
facts
the
little
man
went
to
bed
and
slept
peacefully
until
morning
myrtle
had
begged
them
to
see
that
she
was
called
at
five
that
she
might
have
ample
time
to
get
to
the
depot
for
her
train
but
no
one
called
her
and
the
poor
child
was
so
weary
and
worn
with
her
trip
that
the
soft
bed
enthralled
her
for
many
hours
after
daybreak
patsy
finally
aroused
her
opening
the
blinds
to
let
in
the
sunshine
and
then
sitting
beside
myrtle
bed
to
stroke
her
fair
hair
and
tell
her
it
was
nearly
noon
but
my
train
wailed
the
girl
greatly
distressed
oh
the
train
has
gone
hours
ago
but
never
mind
that
dear
uncle
john
has
telegraphed
to
leadville
and
found
that
anson
jones
is
not
there
he
left
months
ago
and
is
now
wandering
in
fields
and
pastures
unknown
myrtle
sat
up
in
bed
and
glared
at
patsy
gone
she
said
gone
then
what
am
i
to
do
i
ca
imagine
dear
said
patsy
soothingly
what
do
you
think
you
will
do
the
girl
seemed
dazed
and
for
a
time
could
not
reply
you
must
have
thought
of
this
thing
suggested
her
new
friend
for
it
was
quite
possible
anson
jones
would
not
be
in
leadville
when
you
arrived
there
i
did
not
dare
think
of
it
returned
myrtle
in
a
low
frightened
tone
i
once
asked
aunt
martha
what
i
could
do
in
case
uncle
anson
was
to
be
found
and
she
said
he
be
found
for
otherwise
i
would
be
obliged
to
earn
my
own
living
and
she
knew
you
to
be
so
helpless
she
knows
i
can
sew
if
only
i
can
get
work
to
do
said
the
girl
simply
i
not
really
a
cripple
and
i
getting
better
of
my
hurt
every
day
aunt
martha
said
i
would
be
just
as
well
off
in
denver
or
leadville
as
in
chicago
and
made
me
promise
if
the
worst
came
not
to
let
any
charitable
organization
send
me
back
to
her
in
other
words
exclaimed
patsy
indignantly
she
wanted
to
get
rid
of
you
and
did
not
care
what
became
of
you
she
was
afraid
i
would
cost
her
money
admitted
the
poor
child
with
shamed
downcast
eyes
patsy
went
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
out
for
a
time
myrtle
began
to
dress
herself
as
she
said
she
was
not
utterly
helpless
moving
the
upper
part
of
her
body
freely
and
being
able
to
walk
slowly
about
a
room
by
holding
on
to
chairs
or
other
furniture
i
afraid
i
causing
you
a
lot
of
worry
over
me
said
she
smiling
sadly
as
patsy
turned
toward
her
and
that
is
ungrateful
when
i
remember
how
kind
you
have
all
been
why
these
hours
since
i
met
you
have
seemed
like
fairyland
i
shall
treasure
them
as
long
as
i
live
there
must
be
another
train
to
leadville
soon
and
i
take
that
as
soon
as
i
am
ready
i
will
go
to
the
depot
and
wait
there
patsy
looked
at
her
reflectively
the
poor
child
was
called
upon
to
solve
a
queer
problem
one
which
might
well
have
bewildered
the
brain
of
a
more
experienced
person
tell
me
she
said
why
should
you
go
to
leadville
at
all
now
that
you
have
no
friend
or
relative
there
to
care
for
you
my
ticket
is
to
leadville
you
know
replied
myrtle
if
i
did
not
go
i
would
waste
the
money
it
cost
patsy
laughed
at
this
you
a
wonderfully
impractical
child
she
said
deftly
assisting
myrtle
to
finish
dressing
what
you
really
need
is
some
one
to
order
you
around
and
tell
you
what
to
do
so
you
must
stop
thinking
about
yourself
for
a
time
and
let
do
the
thinking
here
sit
in
this
chair
by
the
window
do
you
want
mumbles
in
your
lap
all
right
now
gaze
upon
the
scenery
until
i
come
back
there
a
man
washing
windows
across
the
street
watch
and
see
if
he
does
his
work
properly
then
she
went
away
to
join
a
conference
in
uncle
john
sitting
room
major
doyle
was
speaking
when
she
entered
and
his
voice
was
coldly
ironical
the
temperature
outside
is
six
degrees
above
freezing
he
observed
the
clerk
downstairs
says
the
snow
is
nine
feet
deep
over
the
mountain
trails
and
the
wind
would
cut
an
iron
beam
in
two
if
you
take
an
automobile
to
california
john
you
must
put
it
on
snowshoes
and
connect
it
with
a
steam
uncle
john
his
hands
thrust
deep
in
his
pockets
paced
thoughtfully
up
and
down
the
room
haggerty
said
did
i
give
you
haggerty
record
then
asked
the
major
if
you
want
the
exact
truth
it
safe
to
go
directly
opposite
to
what
haggerty
says
he
a
very
decent
fellow
protested
merrick
and
is
considered
in
the
city
to
be
strictly
honest
but
after
this
you
ca
blame
him
for
the
weather
conditions
here
i
been
talking
with
denver
people
myself
this
morning
and
they
all
say
it
unusual
to
have
such
cold
weather
at
this
time
of
year
the
thermometer
has
been
so
low
in
the
past
years
the
natives
say
are
they
all
named
haggerty
asked
the
major
scornfully
if
you
will
kindly
allow
me
to
speak
and
tell
you
what
haggerty
said
remarked
uncle
john
tersely
i
shall
be
able
to
add
to
your
information
go
ahead
then
haggerty
said
that
in
case
we
ran
into
cold
weather
in
denver
which
was
possible
quite
possible
then
we
had
best
go
south
to
santa
fe
and
take
the
route
of
the
old
santa
fe
trail
as
far
as
albuquerque
or
even
to
el
paso
either
way
we
will
be
sure
to
find
fine
weather
and
good
roads
into
california
so
haggerty
says
it
stands
to
reason
continued
merrick
that
on
the
southern
route
we
will
escape
the
severe
weather
so
i
have
decided
to
adopt
that
plan
i
think
you
are
quite
wise
in
that
broke
in
patsy
before
her
father
could
object
all
those
queer
spanish
names
sound
interesting
said
beth
when
do
we
start
uncle
in
a
day
or
two
i
have
some
things
here
to
attend
to
that
may
delay
us
that
long
but
when
once
we
are
started
southward
we
shall
bowl
along
right
merrily
unless
we
run
into
more
snowstorms
of
course
it
was
the
major
who
said
that
and
pointedly
ignoring
the
remark
uncle
john
turned
to
patsy
and
said
how
did
you
find
myrtle
dean
this
morning
she
is
rested
and
seems
very
bright
and
cheerful
uncle
but
of
course
she
is
much
distressed
by
the
news
that
her
uncle
anson
has
vanished
from
leadville
yet
she
thinks
she
will
continue
her
journey
by
the
next
train
as
she
has
paid
for
her
ticket
and
ca
afford
to
waste
the
money
it
would
be
absurd
for
the
child
to
go
to
leadville
on
that
account
a
mining
camp
is
no
place
for
such
a
frail
thing
returned
merrick
what
would
you
suggest
patsy
really
uncle
john
i
do
know
what
to
suggest
she
can
never
earn
her
living
by
sewing
declared
beth
what
she
ought
to
have
is
a
trained
nurse
and
careful
attention
i
have
a
doctor
up
to
look
her
over
said
uncle
john
in
his
decisive
way
he
was
a
mild
little
man
generally
but
when
he
made
up
his
mind
to
do
a
thing
it
was
useless
to
argue
with
him
even
major
doyle
knew
that
but
the
old
soldier
was
so
fond
of
arguing
for
the
sake
of
argument
and
so
accustomed
to
oppose
his
wealthy
whom
he
loved
dearly
just
the
same
that
he
was
willing
to
accept
defeat
rather
than
permit
merrick
to
act
without
protest
chapter
iv
an
interesting
protégé
a
young
physician
was
appointed
by
the
management
to
attend
any
guest
who
might
require
his
services
and
uncle
john
had
a
talk
with
him
and
sent
him
to
myrtle
room
to
give
her
a
thorough
examination
this
he
did
and
reported
that
the
girl
present
condition
was
due
largely
to
mismanagement
of
her
case
at
the
time
she
was
injured
with
care
she
would
get
better
and
stronger
rapidly
but
the
hip
joint
was
out
of
its
socket
and
only
a
skillful
operation
would
serve
to
permanently
relieve
her
of
lameness
what
she
needs
just
now
continued
the
doctor
is
a
pair
of
crutches
so
she
can
get
around
better
and
be
in
the
fresh
air
and
sunshine
as
much
as
possible
she
is
a
very
frail
little
woman
at
present
and
must
build
up
her
health
and
strength
before
submitting
to
the
operation
i
have
mentioned
then
if
it
is
properly
done
she
ought
to
recover
completely
and
be
as
good
as
new
i
must
inform
you
said
uncle
john
that
myrtle
dean
is
just
a
little
waif
whom
my
nieces
picked
up
on
the
train
i
believe
she
is
without
friends
or
money
such
being
the
circumstances
what
would
you
advise
the
doctor
shook
his
head
gravely
poor
thing
he
said
she
ought
to
be
rich
at
this
juncture
instead
of
poor
for
the
conditions
facing
her
are
serious
the
operation
i
speak
of
is
always
an
expensive
one
and
meantime
the
child
must
go
to
some
charitable
institution
or
wear
out
her
feeble
strength
in
trying
to
earn
enough
to
keep
the
soul
in
her
body
she
seems
to
have
a
brave
and
beautiful
nature
sir
and
were
she
educated
and
cared
for
would
some
day
make
a
splendid
woman
but
the
world
is
full
of
these
sad
cases
i
poor
myself
merrick
but
this
child
interests
me
and
after
you
have
gone
i
shall
do
all
in
my
power
to
assist
her
thank
you
said
uncle
john
thoughtfully
nodding
his
bald
head
i
think
it
over
and
see
you
again
doctor
before
i
leave
an
hour
later
myrtle
was
fitted
with
crutches
of
the
best
sort
obtainable
and
was
overjoyed
to
find
how
greatly
they
assisted
her
the
major
a
kindly
man
decided
to
take
myrtle
out
for
a
drive
and
while
they
were
gone
uncle
john
had
a
long
conversation
with
beth
and
patsy
here
is
a
case
said
he
where
my
dreadful
money
can
do
some
good
i
am
anxious
to
help
myrtle
dean
for
i
believe
she
is
deserving
of
my
best
offices
but
i
do
exactly
know
what
to
do
she
is
really
protégé
my
dears
and
i
am
going
to
put
the
affair
in
your
hands
for
settlement
just
tell
me
what
to
do
and
i
do
it
spend
my
money
as
freely
upon
myrtle
as
you
please
the
girls
faced
the
problem
with
enthusiasm
she
a
dear
little
thing
remarked
patsy
and
seems
very
grateful
for
the
least
kindness
shown
her
i
am
sure
she
has
never
been
treated
very
nicely
by
that
old
aunt
of
hers
in
all
my
experience
said
beth
speaking
as
if
her
years
were
doubled
i
have
never
known
anyone
so
utterly
helpless
she
is
very
young
and
inexperienced
with
no
friends
no
money
and
scarcely
recovered
from
an
accident
it
is
clearly
our
duty
to
do
something
for
myrtle
and
aside
from
the
humane
obligation
i
feel
that
already
i
love
the
child
having
known
her
only
a
day
admitting
all
this
beth
returned
her
uncle
you
are
not
answering
my
question
what
shall
we
do
for
myrtle
how
can
we
best
assist
her
why
not
take
her
to
california
with
us
inquired
patsy
with
sudden
inspiration
the
sunshine
and
roses
would
make
a
new
girl
of
her
in
a
few
weeks
could
she
ride
so
far
in
an
automobile
asked
beth
doubtfully
why
not
the
fresh
air
would
be
just
the
thing
for
her
you
get
a
big
touring
car
wo
you
uncle
john
i
bought
one
already
a
and
there
will
be
plenty
of
room
in
it
for
myrtle
he
said
good
gracious
where
did
you
find
the
thing
so
suddenly
cried
patsy
i
made
the
purchase
this
morning
bright
and
early
before
you
were
up
replied
merrick
smilingly
it
is
a
fine
new
car
and
as
soon
as
i
saw
it
i
knew
it
was
what
i
wanted
it
is
now
being
fitted
up
for
our
use
fitted
up
yes
i
an
idea
in
my
head
to
make
it
a
movable
hotel
if
going
to
cross
the
plains
and
the
mountains
and
the
deserts
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
we
must
be
prepared
for
any
emergencies
i
also
sent
for
a
chauffeur
who
is
highly
recommended
he
knows
the
route
we
going
to
take
can
make
all
repairs
necessary
in
case
of
accident
and
is
an
experienced
driver
i
expect
him
here
any
minute
his
name
is
wampus
but
about
myrtle
said
beth
can
we
make
her
comfortable
on
a
long
ride
certainly
asserted
uncle
john
we
are
not
going
to
travel
day
and
night
my
dear
for
as
soon
as
we
get
away
from
this
frozen
country
we
can
take
our
time
and
journey
by
short
stages
my
notion
is
that
we
will
have
more
fun
on
the
way
than
we
will
in
california
myrtle
has
any
proper
clothes
observed
patsy
reflectively
we
have
to
shop
for
her
beth
while
uncle
is
getting
the
car
ready
are
you
sure
to
leave
uncle
john
inquired
beth
or
the
next
day
there
no
use
leaving
before
the
is
ready
to
ship
oh
we
not
going
to
ride
in
it
then
not
just
yet
we
shall
take
the
train
south
to
santa
fe
and
perhaps
to
albuquerque
i
talk
to
wampus
about
that
when
we
reach
a
good
climate
we
begin
the
journey
overland
and
not
before
then
said
patsy
i
sure
we
shall
have
time
to
fit
out
myrtle
very
nicely
wampus
was
announced
just
then
and
while
uncle
john
conferred
with
the
chauffeur
his
two
nieces
went
to
their
room
to
talk
over
myrtle
dean
outfit
and
await
the
return
of
the
girl
from
her
ride
they
tell
me
said
merrick
that
you
are
an
experienced
chauffeur
i
am
celebrate
replied
wampus
not
as
chauffeur
but
as
expert
automobilist
he
was
a
little
man
and
quite
thin
his
legs
were
short
and
his
arms
long
he
had
expressionless
light
gray
eyes
and
sandy
hair
cropped
close
to
his
scalp
his
mouth
was
wide
and
his
chin
long
and
broad
his
ears
enormous
in
size
and
set
at
right
angles
with
his
head
his
cheek
bones
were
as
high
and
prominent
as
those
of
an
indian
and
after
a
critical
examination
of
the
man
uncle
john
was
impelled
to
ask
his
nationality
i
am
born
in
canada
at
quebec
province
he
answered
my
father
he
trapper
my
mother
squaw
for
me
i
american
sir
and
my
name
celebrate
over
all
the
world
for
knowing
automobile
like
father
knows
his
son
he
paused
and
added
impressively
i
am
wampus
have
you
ever
driven
an
car
asked
merrick
i
can
take
him
apart
blindfold
an
put
him
together
again
have
you
ever
been
overland
to
california
three
time
then
you
know
the
country
in
the
dark
i
am
wampus
very
good
wampus
you
seem
to
be
the
man
i
want
for
i
am
going
to
california
in
an
car
by
way
of
the
santa
fe
trail
and
and
no
matter
we
find
way
i
am
i
know
now
tell
me
wampus
if
i
employ
you
will
you
be
faithful
and
careful
i
have
two
girls
in
my
party
three
girls
in
fact
and
from
the
moment
you
enter
my
service
i
shall
expect
you
to
watch
over
our
welfare
and
guide
us
with
skill
and
intelligence
will
you
do
this
the
man
seemed
somewhat
offended
by
the
question
when
you
have
wampus
what
more
you
want
he
inquired
maybe
you
not
know
wampus
you
come
from
far
east
all
right
you
go
out
and
ask
automobile
man
about
wampus
ask
when
you
have
inquire
you
feel
more
happy
i
come
again
he
started
to
go
but
merrick
restrained
him
you
have
been
highly
recommended
already
said
he
but
you
can
not
expect
me
to
have
as
high
an
opinion
of
you
as
you
have
of
yourself
at
least
until
i
know
you
better
would
you
like
to
undertake
this
engagement
yes
just
now
i
free
my
business
is
expert
automobilist
i
am
wampus
but
perhaps
you
want
cheap
man
my
price
high
what
is
your
price
fifty
dollar
week
you
eat
me
an
sleep
me
i
do
not
object
to
your
price
come
out
with
me
to
the
garage
and
i
will
show
you
my
car
and
explain
what
is
being
done
to
it
although
all
the
automobile
men
seemed
to
defer
most
respectfully
to
wampus
merrick
did
not
neglect
to
make
proper
inquiries
in
regard
to
the
man
locally
he
really
was
celebrate
and
uncle
john
was
assured
on
all
sides
that
he
was
fortunate
to
get
so
intelligent
and
experienced
a
chauffeur
as
this
same
wampus
he
seems
to
have
instinctive
knowledge
of
all
machinery
said
one
informant
and
can
handle
perfectly
any
car
that
is
made
the
only
trouble
with
the
fellow
is
that
he
is
conceited
i
noticed
that
returned
merrick
another
thing
said
the
gentleman
do
believe
implicitly
all
that
wampus
tells
you
he
has
a
habit
of
imagining
things
but
he
is
a
faithful
honest
fellow
for
all
that
and
will
handle
your
car
better
than
any
other
man
you
could
get
in
denver
or
anywhere
in
the
west
i
imagine
so
wampus
was
engaged
and
putting
the
man
references
and
indorsements
all
together
merrick
felt
that
he
had
gained
a
prize
when
the
big
major
returning
from
his
drive
escorted
myrtle
dean
to
the
elevator
the
girl
was
joyously
using
her
new
crutches
patsy
and
beth
met
her
and
said
they
had
important
news
to
communicate
not
until
she
was
in
her
own
room
seated
in
a
comfortable
chair
and
gazing
at
them
anxiously
did
they
tell
the
poor
waif
of
the
good
fortune
in
store
for
her
uncle
john
announced
patsy
has
invited
you
to
join
our
party
and
go
to
california
with
us
myrtle
stared
a
moment
as
if
trying
to
realize
what
that
meant
the
tiny
mumbles
sitting
beside
the
chair
with
his
head
cocked
to
one
side
suddenly
made
a
prodigious
leap
and
landed
in
myrtle
lap
where
he
began
licking
her
chin
and
wagging
his
stumpy
tail
as
if
seconding
the
invitation
as
the
girl
stroked
his
soft
hair
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
oh
you
are
all
so
kind
to
me
she
sobbed
losing
her
composure
but
i
ca
go
of
course
i
ca
go
why
not
asked
beth
smiling
it
would
be
an
impersition
poor
myrtle
sometimes
stumbled
over
big
words
i
know
that
i
ca
let
you
burden
your
happy
party
with
a
poor
cripple
just
because
your
hearts
are
kind
and
you
pity
me
nonsense
said
beth
you
not
a
cripple
dear
you
just
an
invalid
and
will
soon
be
as
strong
as
any
of
us
we
have
invited
you
myrtle
because
we
all
like
you
and
shall
soon
learn
to
love
you
we
are
selfish
enough
to
want
your
companionship
it
is
pity
at
all
you
see
i
mighty
glad
added
patsy
your
uncle
anson
ran
away
from
leadville
if
he
had
done
that
we
should
have
had
to
give
you
up
but
now
we
may
keep
you
as
long
as
we
wish
for
you
have
any
particular
engagement
to
interfere
with
our
plans
all
this
was
said
so
frankly
and
unaffectedly
that
little
myrtle
was
led
to
abandon
her
suspicion
and
grew
radiant
with
delight
indeed
she
hugged
and
squeezed
the
squirming
mumbles
until
he
resented
such
strenuous
fondling
and
escaped
to
patsy
more
moderate
embraces
myrtle
had
never
yet
ridden
in
an
automobile
and
the
prospect
of
a
long
journey
across
the
country
in
a
big
touring
car
with
california
roses
and
sunshine
at
the
end
of
it
was
certainly
alluring
enough
to
intoxicate
one
far
more
accustomed
to
pleasure
than
this
friendless
impoverished
girl
after
the
cousins
had
explained
all
their
plans
to
myrtle
and
assured
her
she
was
to
be
their
cherished
guest
for
a
long
time
until
she
was
well
and
strong
again
at
the
least
they
broached
the
subject
of
her
outfit
the
poor
child
flushed
painfully
while
admitting
the
meagerness
of
her
wardrobe
all
her
possessions
were
contained
in
one
small
canvas
and
she
lacked
many
necessities
which
her
callous
aunt
had
suggested
that
uncle
anson
might
be
induced
to
buy
for
her
once
she
had
joined
him
in
leadville
uncle
john
nieces
grew
more
and
more
indignant
as
they
discovered
the
details
of
this
selfish
woman
crime
for
patsy
declared
it
was
nothing
less
than
a
crime
to
send
a
helpless
child
far
into
the
west
to
search
for
an
unknown
uncle
whose
whereabouts
were
only
conjectural
that
very
afternoon
beth
and
patsy
began
shopping
for
myrtle
and
presently
all
sorts
of
parcels
big
and
little
began
to
arrive
for
their
new
protégé
myrtle
was
amazed
and
awed
by
the
splendor
of
her
new
apparel
and
could
scarcely
believe
her
good
fortune
it
seemed
like
a
fairy
tale
to
her
and
she
imagined
herself
a
cinderella
with
two
fairy
godmothers
who
were
young
and
pretty
girls
possessing
the
purse
of
fortunatus
and
the
generosity
of
glinda
the
good
at
night
when
she
was
supposed
to
be
asleep
myrtle
crept
from
her
bed
turned
on
the
electric
light
and
gloated
over
her
treasures
which
she
had
almost
feared
might
vanish
into
thin
air
and
leave
her
as
desolate
as
before
next
morning
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
the
girls
took
myrtle
out
with
them
to
some
of
the
shops
fitting
her
to
shoes
and
gloves
and
having
her
try
on
some
gowns
so
that
they
might
be
quickly
altered
for
her
use
patsy
also
bought
her
a
set
of
soft
and
pretty
furs
thinking
she
might
need
them
on
the
journey
if
the
weather
continued
cool
and
this
seemed
to
cap
the
climax
of
happiness
what
me
most
gasped
the
child
trying
to
get
her
breath
between
the
surprises
she
experienced
is
how
you
can
think
of
so
many
things
to
do
for
me
of
course
i
know
you
are
rich
but
never
before
heard
of
rich
people
being
so
very
generous
to
poor
ones
once
said
beth
gravely
we
were
poor
ourselves
patsy
and
i
and
had
to
work
hard
for
our
living
that
was
before
our
uncle
john
came
and
gave
us
a
share
of
his
money
together
with
his
love
and
sympathy
is
it
natural
my
dear
that
we
should
now
be
eager
to
share
our
good
fortune
with
you
since
we
have
more
money
than
we
can
use
otherwise
and
you
are
to
be
our
little
friend
and
companion
perhaps
so
replied
myrtle
smiling
gaily
and
much
comforted
by
the
explanation
but
oh
dear
i
so
glad
you
found
me
we
are
glad
too
said
patsy
but
here
it
is
time
for
luncheon
and
we
wasted
the
whole
morning
in
shopping
i
sure
the
major
will
be
cross
if
we
do
not
hurry
back
to
the
hotel
chapter
v
a
wonder
on
wheels
but
the
major
was
not
cross
when
they
met
him
in
uncle
john
sitting
room
he
beamed
upon
the
three
girls
most
genially
for
he
liked
myrtle
and
fully
approved
all
that
was
being
done
for
her
of
course
it
like
patsy
he
had
said
to
merrick
that
morning
she
could
help
being
a
sweet
ministering
angel
if
she
tried
and
beth
is
growing
more
and
more
like
her
it
will
do
those
girls
good
john
to
have
some
human
being
to
coddle
and
care
for
if
patsy
could
have
a
fault
it
would
be
wasting
so
much
affection
on
that
bunch
rags
mumbles
who
audaciously
chewed
up
one
of
my
pet
slippers
while
i
was
at
dinner
last
evening
no
dog
is
a
fit
thing
to
occupy
a
time
and
this
imp
o
mischief
mumbles
must
take
a
back
seat
from
now
on
uncle
john
laughed
for
he
knew
his
had
never
conquered
his
antipathy
for
poor
mumbles
and
realized
why
take
care
that
you
do
not
get
jealous
of
myrtle
he
replied
you
a
selfish
old
beast
and
do
wish
patsy
to
love
anyone
but
yourself
and
why
should
she
was
the
inquiry
any
dutiful
daughter
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
loving
such
a
father
as
i
am
and
in
that
remarked
uncle
john
whimsically
you
remind
me
of
wampus
you
should
strut
around
and
say
me
i
am
father
the
major
was
full
of
news
at
luncheon
time
what
do
you
think
my
dears
he
said
addressing
the
girls
your
crazy
uncle
must
have
had
another
snooze
unbeknown
to
us
for
got
the
wildest
idea
into
his
head
that
human
brains
or
lack
of
them
ever
conceived
you
are
not
very
respectful
sir
retorted
merrick
stiffly
as
he
ate
his
salad
but
we
must
not
expect
too
much
of
a
disabled
soldier
and
an
irishman
to
boot
who
has
not
been
accustomed
to
good
society
major
doyle
looked
at
his
with
an
approving
smile
very
well
put
john
he
said
you
improving
in
repartee
presently
you
add
that
i
unlettered
and
uncivilized
and
no
fit
associate
for
a
person
who
has
made
an
egregious
fortune
out
of
tin
cans
in
the
wilds
of
oregon
but
what
the
news
asked
patsy
impatiently
what
new
idea
has
uncle
john
conceived
first
replied
the
major
he
has
bought
an
automobile
as
big
as
a
baggage
car
next
he
has
engaged
a
chauffeur
who
is
a
wild
canadian
indian
with
a
trace
of
erratic
french
blood
in
his
veins
a
combination
liable
to
result
in
anything
wampus
the
calls
himself
and
from
the
looks
of
him
he
murdered
many
a
one
in
his
day
oh
major
show
me
an
automobile
driver
that
has
myrtle
knows
it
no
trick
to
knock
over
a
peaceful
pedestrian
or
so
to
say
nothing
of
chickens
cats
and
dogs
mangled
by
the
roadside
i
confidently
expect
he
make
a
pancake
of
dear
little
mumbles
before
he
five
miles
on
the
road
eh
patsy
be
sensible
daddy
it
my
strong
point
if
i
any
judge
of
character
this
wampus
is
a
speed
fiend
he
is
recommended
as
a
very
careful
driver
said
merrick
and
moreover
he
has
signed
a
contract
to
obey
my
orders
very
good
said
beth
i
not
afraid
of
wampus
what
next
major
next
continued
patsy
father
with
a
solemn
wink
at
the
row
of
curious
faces
your
inventive
relative
has
ordered
the
automobile
rebuilt
thinking
he
wiser
than
the
makers
he
having
a
furnace
put
in
it
for
one
thing
it
a
limousine
you
know
and
all
enclosed
in
glass
also
it
as
big
as
a
barn
as
i
said
you
said
a
freight
car
observed
patsy
true
a
small
barn
or
a
big
freight
car
the
seats
are
to
be
made
convertible
into
sleeping
berths
so
if
we
get
caught
out
overnight
we
have
all
the
comforts
of
a
hotel
except
the
bell
boys
i
be
the
bell
boy
promised
patsy
also
we
to
take
a
portable
kitchen
along
like
they
use
in
the
army
with
a
gasoline
stove
all
complete
the
thing
fits
under
the
back
seat
i
believe
all
this
said
beth
strikes
me
as
being
very
sensible
and
a
credit
to
uncle
john
genius
i
a
good
cook
as
you
know
and
the
kitchen
outfit
appeals
to
me
but
how
about
provisions
provisions
are
being
provided
replied
her
uncle
genially
smiling
at
her
praise
however
scornfully
the
major
might
view
his
preparations
he
was
himself
mightily
proud
of
them
tinned
stuff
i
presume
remarked
his
john
merrick
has
a
weakness
for
tin
cans
having
got
his
money
out
of
them
you
wrong
protested
uncle
john
i
merely
made
my
money
from
the
tin
the
cans
were
made
of
but
we
wo
get
money
out
of
these
cans
when
they
opened
it
will
be
something
better
such
as
sardines
and
hominy
preserved
cream
and
caviar
beans
and
boned
chicken
sounds
fine
cried
patsy
with
enthusiasm
but
how
can
you
arrange
to
carry
so
much
uncle
the
limousine
body
is
pretty
big
as
the
major
says
and
high
enough
to
allow
me
to
put
in
a
false
bottom
in
the
space
beneath
it
i
shall
stow
all
the
bedding
the
eatables
and
kitchen
utensils
and
a
small
tent
then
we
shall
be
prepared
for
whatever
happens
i
doubt
it
objected
the
major
there
gasoline
to
be
reckoned
with
it
well
enough
to
feed
ourselves
but
what
if
we
ran
short
of
the
precious
feed
for
the
engines
the
two
tanks
will
hold
sixty
gallons
that
ought
to
carry
us
any
reasonable
distance
replied
merrick
you
see
daddy
our
uncle
john
is
an
experienced
traveler
while
you
are
not
declared
patsy
in
all
our
journeys
together
i
found
him
full
of
resources
and
very
farsighted
this
trip
does
worry
me
at
all
nor
me
added
beth
we
are
sure
to
have
a
delightful
time
under
uncle
auspices
wampus
said
uncle
john
is
so
pleased
with
my
preparations
that
he
wants
us
to
start
in
the
car
from
here
can
you
put
it
on
runners
like
a
sledge
asked
the
major
the
only
way
it
could
travel
through
this
snow
or
perhaps
you
hire
a
snowplow
to
go
ahead
of
it
no
i
told
wampus
it
was
impracticable
was
the
reply
we
shall
load
our
machine
on
a
flat
car
and
ship
it
to
albuquerque
which
is
in
new
mexico
and
almost
directly
south
of
denver
we
shall
then
be
over
the
worst
grades
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
which
way
do
we
go
then
inquired
beth
i
have
not
yet
decided
we
can
go
still
farther
south
into
texas
or
make
our
way
down
into
phoenix
and
across
the
prairies
to
imperial
valley
or
follow
the
santa
fe
route
by
way
of
the
grand
canyon
oh
let
go
that
way
exclaimed
patsy
and
freeze
to
death
asked
the
major
it
the
northernmost
route
when
we
get
to
albuquerque
we
will
be
below
the
line
of
frosts
and
snow
explained
merrick
the
climate
is
genial
all
through
that
section
during
winter
haggerty
says
i
guessed
it
groaned
the
major
if
haggerty
recommends
this
trip
we
surely
be
in
trouble
aside
from
haggerty
wampus
knows
that
country
thoroughly
said
uncle
john
stoutly
tell
me
did
haggerty
recommend
wampus
no
then
there
hopes
of
the
fellow
as
you
say
john
there
is
no
need
to
decide
until
we
get
to
albuquerque
when
do
we
make
the
start
day
after
the
car
will
be
shipped
night
but
our
party
will
follow
by
daylight
so
as
to
see
colorado
springs
peak
and
pueblo
as
we
pass
by
them
chapter
vi
wampus
speeds
so
this
is
albuquerque
observed
patsy
doyle
as
they
alighted
from
the
train
is
it
a
big
town
playing
among
those
hills
uncle
john
or
is
this
really
all
there
is
to
the
place
it
a
pretty
big
town
my
dear
most
of
the
houses
are
back
on
the
prairie
but
fortunately
our
hold
is
just
here
at
the
depot
it
was
a
quaint
attractive
building
made
of
adobe
cement
in
the
ancient
mission
style
but
it
proved
roomy
and
extremely
comfortable
seems
to
me
whispered
myrtle
to
beth
we
high
up
on
the
mountains
even
yet
so
we
are
was
the
reply
we
just
between
glorietta
pass
and
the
great
continental
divide
but
the
steepest
of
the
rockies
are
behind
us
and
now
the
slopes
are
more
gradual
all
the
way
to
california
how
do
you
like
it
dear
oh
the
mountains
are
grand
exclaimed
myrtle
i
had
never
imagined
anything
so
big
and
stately
and
beautiful
the
other
girls
had
seen
mountains
before
but
this
was
their
friend
first
experience
and
they
took
much
pleasure
in
myrtle
enthusiastic
delight
over
all
she
saw
adjoining
the
hotel
was
a
bazaar
in
front
of
which
sat
squatted
upon
the
ground
two
rows
of
mojave
indians
mostly
squaws
with
their
curious
wares
spread
out
for
sale
upon
blankets
there
must
have
been
a
score
of
them
and
they
exhibited
odd
pottery
ornaments
of
indistinguishable
shapes
strings
of
glass
beads
and
beadwork
bags
and
a
few
really
fine
jardinieres
and
baskets
after
the
girls
had
been
to
their
rooms
and
established
themselves
in
the
hotel
they
hurried
out
to
interview
the
indians
myrtle
dean
supporting
herself
by
her
crutches
while
patsy
and
beth
walked
beside
her
the
lame
girl
seemed
to
attract
the
squaws
at
once
and
one
gave
her
a
bead
necklace
while
another
pressed
upon
her
a
small
brown
earthenware
fowl
with
white
spots
all
over
it
this
latter
might
have
been
meant
to
represent
a
goose
an
ostrich
or
a
guinea
hen
but
myrtle
was
delighted
with
it
and
thanked
the
generous
squaw
who
responded
merely
with
a
grunt
not
understanding
english
a
man
in
a
wide
sombrero
who
stood
lazily
by
observed
the
incident
and
said
do
thank
the
hag
she
selfish
the
mojaven
think
it
brings
luck
to
have
a
gift
accepted
by
a
cripple
myrtle
flushed
painfully
i
suppose
my
crutches
make
me
look
more
helpless
than
i
really
am
she
whispered
to
her
friends
as
they
moved
away
but
they
such
a
help
in
getting
around
that
i
very
grateful
to
have
them
and
as
i
get
stronger
i
can
lay
them
aside
and
not
be
taken
for
a
cripple
any
more
the
air
was
delightfully
invigorating
here
in
the
mountains
yet
it
was
not
at
all
cold
the
snow
as
uncle
john
had
predicted
had
all
been
left
behind
them
after
dinner
they
took
a
walk
through
the
pretty
town
and
were
caught
in
the
dark
before
they
could
get
back
the
twilights
are
very
brief
in
albuquerque
this
is
a
very
old
town
remarked
uncle
john
it
was
founded
by
a
spanish
adventurer
named
cabrillo
in
the
seventeenth
century
long
before
the
united
states
came
into
existence
but
of
course
it
never
amounted
to
anything
until
the
railroad
was
built
next
day
they
were
sitting
in
a
group
before
the
hotel
when
a
man
was
seen
approaching
them
with
shuffling
steps
uncle
john
looked
at
him
closely
and
mumbles
leaped
from
patsy
lap
and
rushed
at
the
stranger
with
excited
barks
why
it
wampus
said
merrick
the
car
must
have
arrived
wampus
caught
up
the
baby
dog
and
held
it
under
his
arm
while
he
took
his
cap
off
and
bowed
respectfully
to
his
employer
he
an
me
we
here
he
announced
who
is
wampus
when
did
you
arrive
half
hour
ago
he
on
side
track
very
good
you
have
made
capital
time
for
a
freight
train
let
us
go
at
once
and
get
the
car
unloaded
wampus
hesitated
looking
sheepish
i
been
arrest
he
said
arrested
for
what
i
make
speed
they
not
like
it
they
arrest
me
wampus
he
straightened
his
slim
little
form
with
an
assumption
of
dignity
i
knew
it
sighed
the
major
i
decided
he
was
a
speed
fiend
the
first
time
i
saw
him
but
dear
me
said
uncle
john
how
could
you
be
arrested
for
speeding
when
the
automobile
was
on
a
fiat
car
wampus
glanced
over
his
shoulder
two
railroad
men
had
followed
him
and
were
now
lounging
against
the
porch
railing
one
had
his
right
eye
bandaged
while
the
other
carried
one
arm
in
a
sling
both
scowled
as
they
eyed
the
canadian
fixedly
freight
train
make
pretty
slow
time
began
the
chauffeur
i
know
you
in
hurry
so
freight
train
he
make
me
nervous
i
say
polite
to
conductor
i
like
to
go
faster
he
laugh
i
say
polite
to
brakeman
we
must
go
faster
he
make
abusing
speech
i
climb
into
engine
an
say
polite
to
engineer
to
turn
on
steam
he
insult
me
so
i
put
my
foot
on
him
an
run
engine
myself
i
am
wampus
i
understan
engine
all
kinds
brakeman
he
swear
he
swear
so
bad
i
put
him
off
train
conductor
must
have
lump
of
coal
in
eye
to
keep
quiet
fireman
he
smile
an
whistle
soft
an
say
nothing
so
we
friends
when
i
say
in
coal
he
shovel
when
we
pass
stations
quick
like
he
whistle
with
engine
loud
so
now
we
here
an
i
been
arrest
patsy
tittered
and
stuffed
her
handkerchief
into
her
mouth
uncle
john
first
chuckled
and
then
looked
grave
the
major
advanced
to
wampus
and
soberly
shook
his
hand
you
a
brave
man
sir
for
a
chauffeur
he
said
i
congratulate
you
wampus
still
looked
uneasy
i
been
arrest
he
repeated
uncle
john
beckoned
the
railroad
men
to
come
forward
is
this
story
true
he
asked
most
of
it
sir
answered
the
conductor
it
only
by
the
mercy
of
providence
we
here
alive
this
scoundrel
held
up
the
whole
crew
and
ran
away
with
the
engine
we
might
have
had
a
dozen
collisions
or
for
he
went
around
curves
at
sixty
miles
an
hour
we
cut
our
train
in
two
so
as
to
pull
half
of
it
at
a
time
up
the
grade
at
lamy
and
so
there
were
only
six
cars
on
this
end
of
it
the
other
half
is
seventy
miles
back
and
part
of
what
we
have
here
ought
to
have
been
left
at
the
way
stations
i
ca
make
out
sir
whether
it
burglary
or
highway
robbery
or
arson
an
murder
he
guilty
of
or
all
of
but
i
telegraphed
for
instructions
and
i
hold
him
a
prisoner
until
the
superintendent
tells
me
what
to
do
with
him
merrick
was
very
sober
now
the
matter
is
serious
he
said
this
man
is
in
my
employ
but
i
did
not
hire
him
to
steal
a
railway
train
or
fight
its
crew
not
badly
hurt
i
hope
sir
my
eye
pretty
bad
growled
the
conductor
tom
here
thought
his
arm
was
broken
at
first
but
i
guess
it
only
sprained
how
about
the
brakeman
he
threw
off
the
train
why
we
were
not
going
fast
just
then
and
it
did
hurt
him
we
saw
him
get
up
and
shake
his
fist
at
the
robber
if
he
ever
meets
wampus
again
he
murder
him
come
with
me
to
the
telegraph
office
and
i
see
what
i
can
do
to
straighten
this
out
said
merrick
briskly
on
the
way
he
remarked
to
the
conductor
i
sorry
i
let
wampus
travel
alone
he
just
a
little
bit
affected
in
his
mind
you
know
and
at
times
responsible
for
what
he
does
the
conductor
scratched
his
head
doubtfully
i
suspected
he
was
crazy
he
replied
and
that
why
i
did
hurt
him
but
if
he
crazy
he
the
most
deliberate
loonatic
i
ever
run
acrost
the
superintendent
had
just
wired
instructions
to
put
the
outlaw
in
jail
when
merrick
reached
the
telegraph
office
but
after
an
hour
spent
in
sending
messages
back
and
forth
a
compromise
was
affected
and
the
little
millionaire
had
agreed
to
pay
a
goodly
sum
to
the
company
by
way
of
damages
and
to
satisfy
the
crew
of
the
freight
train
which
he
succeeded
in
doing
by
a
further
outlay
of
money
you
not
worth
all
this
bother
said
merrick
to
the
humbled
wampus
when
the
final
settlement
had
been
made
but
chauffeurs
are
scarce
in
albuquerque
and
i
ca
be
delayed
never
sir
while
you
are
in
my
employ
must
you
allow
yourself
to
be
guilty
of
such
an
act
again
wampus
sighed
never
he
promised
will
i
ride
by
freight
train
again
send
car
by
express
i
am
wampus
freight
train
he
make
me
nervous
the
automobile
was
quickly
unloaded
and
at
once
wampus
set
to
work
to
get
it
in
running
order
he
drove
it
to
the
hotel
at
about
sundown
and
merrick
told
the
girls
to
be
ready
to
start
after
an
early
breakfast
the
next
morning
which
way
do
we
go
asked
the
major
we
have
a
talk
with
wampus
this
evening
and
decide
said
uncle
john
do
leave
out
the
grand
canyon
begged
patsy
nor
the
petrified
forests
added
beth
and
could
we
visit
the
moki
indian
reservation
those
things
may
be
well
enough
in
their
way
observed
the
major
but
is
their
way
our
way
that
the
question
the
one
thing
we
must
take
into
consideration
is
the
matter
of
roads
we
must
discover
which
road
is
the
best
and
then
take
it
we
not
out
of
the
mountains
yet
and
we
shall
have
left
the
railroad
the
last
vestige
of
civilization
behind
us
but
the
conference
evolved
the
fact
according
to
wampus
that
the
best
and
safest
roads
were
for
a
time
along
the
line
of
the
santa
fe
directly
west
and
this
would
enable
them
to
visit
most
of
the
scenes
the
girls
were
eager
to
see
no
boulevard
in
mountain
anywhere
remarked
wampus
but
road
he
good
enough
to
ride
on
go
slow
an
go
safe
i
drive
from
here
to
los
angeles
blindfold
with
this
assurance
they
were
obliged
to
be
content
and
an
eager
and
joyful
party
assembled
next
morning
to
begin
the
journey
so
long
looked
forward
to
the
landlord
of
the
hotel
a
man
with
a
careworn
face
shook
his
head
dismally
and
predicted
their
return
to
albuquerque
within
hours
of
course
people
make
the
trip
from
here
to
the
coast
he
said
but
it
mighty
seldom
and
they
all
swear
they
never
do
it
again
it
uncomfortable
and
it
dangerous
why
asked
uncle
john
you
headed
through
a
wild
country
settled
only
by
mexicans
indians
and
gangs
of
cowboys
still
worse
the
roads
are
something
awful
that
man
wampus
is
an
optimist
and
will
tackle
anything
and
then
be
sorry
for
it
afterward
the
towns
are
scattered
from
here
on
and
you
wo
strike
a
decent
meal
except
at
the
railway
stations
taking
all
these
things
into
consideration
i
advise
you
to
make
your
headquarters
here
for
the
winter
thank
you
returned
merrick
pleasantly
it
too
late
for
us
to
back
out
now
even
if
we
felt
nervous
and
afraid
which
i
assure
you
we
do
not
we
are
not
looking
for
excessive
comfort
on
this
journey
you
know
remarked
patsy
but
thank
you
for
your
warning
sir
it
has
given
us
great
pleasure
for
if
there
were
no
chance
of
adventure
before
us
we
should
all
be
greatly
disappointed
again
the
landlord
shook
his
head
right
asked
wampus
at
the
wheel
go
ahead
said
merrick
and
slowly
the
big
car
started
upon
its
journey
into
the
golden
west
the
air
was
keen
and
bracing
but
not
chilly
the
sunshine
flooded
the
landscape
on
every
side
all
the
windows
of
the
limousine
had
been
lowered
myrtle
dean
had
been
established
in
one
corner
of
the
broad
back
seat
where
she
nestled
comfortably
among
the
cushions
uncle
john
sat
beside
her
with
beth
and
the
major
on
the
seat
on
front
there
were
two
folding
chairs
that
could
be
used
on
occasion
and
the
back
seat
easily
accommodated
three
the
autocrat
being
a
seven
passenger
car
but
patsy
was
perched
in
front
beside
wampus
which
was
really
the
choicest
seat
of
all
so
there
was
ample
room
inside
to
swing
a
cat
as
the
major
stated
if
anyone
had
cared
to
attempt
such
a
feat
of
course
the
wee
mumbles
was
in
patsy
lap
and
he
seemed
to
have
overcome
his
first
aversion
of
wampus
and
accepted
the
little
chauffeur
into
the
circle
of
his
favored
acquaintances
indeed
they
soon
became
fast
friends
on
leaving
the
town
wampus
turned
into
a
smooth
hard
wagon
road
that
ran
in
zigzag
fashion
near
the
railroad
grade
the
car
bowled
along
right
merrily
for
some
twenty
miles
when
the
driver
turned
to
the
right
and
skimmed
along
a
high
plateau
it
was
green
and
seemed
fertile
but
scarcely
a
farmhouse
could
they
see
although
the
clear
air
permitted
a
broad
view
he
up
hill
now
all
way
to
continental
divide
said
wampus
to
patsy
then
he
go
down
hill
long
time
it
does
seem
to
be
much
uphill
returned
the
girl
and
the
road
is
very
good
we
make
time
here
observed
the
driver
we
find
rock
bad
road
then
we
go
slow
the
major
was
watching
the
new
chauffeur
carefully
and
despite
his
dismal
forebodings
the
man
seemed
not
at
all
reckless
but
handled
his
car
with
rare
skill
so
the
critic
turned
to
his
and
asked
is
it
fully
decided
which
way
we
shall
go
i
left
it
to
wampus
and
the
girls
was
the
reply
on
account
of
our
little
invalid
here
we
shall
take
the
most
direct
route
to
california
it
is
a
short
route
at
that
on
beth
account
we
shall
visit
the
moki
and
navajo
reservations
and
on
patsy
account
we
going
by
way
of
the
grand
canyon
of
arizona
wampus
says
he
knows
every
inch
of
the
road
so
for
my
part
i
content
to
be
just
a
passenger
which
remark
said
the
major
indicates
that
i
to
be
just
a
passenger
also
very
well
john
i
willing
there
may
be
trouble
ahead
of
us
but
is
so
magnificent
that
it
wise
to
forget
everything
but
the
present
chapter
vii
the
chauffeur
improves
they
all
enjoyed
that
first
day
ride
wampus
did
not
drive
fast
for
there
were
places
where
he
could
yet
by
one
they
had
reached
laguna
sixty
miles
from
their
starting
point
there
was
an
excellent
railway
hotel
here
so
they
decided
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
and
the
night
at
laguna
and
proceed
early
the
next
morning
the
big
car
was
an
object
of
much
curiosity
to
the
natives
and
during
the
afternoon
wampus
was
the
center
of
attraction
myrtle
had
stood
the
ride
remarkably
well
and
uncle
john
noticed
that
her
eyes
were
brighter
and
a
shade
of
color
had
already
crept
into
her
pale
cheeks
having
risen
early
all
three
of
the
girls
took
a
nap
during
the
afternoon
as
did
merrick
the
major
gossiped
with
the
station
agent
the
most
important
individual
in
town
and
gleaned
sundry
information
that
made
him
look
rather
glum
i
do
say
the
road
exactly
dangerous
mind
you
added
the
man
but
these
greasers
and
injuns
get
mischievous
at
times
harmless
as
they
look
all
i
advisin
is
that
you
keep
a
sharp
eye
on
finding
wampus
cleaning
his
car
while
a
circle
of
silent
attentive
inhabitants
looked
on
the
major
said
to
him
in
a
low
voice
have
you
a
revolver
wampus
shook
his
head
never
carry
him
he
replied
all
gun
he
make
trouble
sometime
he
shoot
wrong
man
do
like
gun
why
should
i
i
am
wampus
the
major
entered
the
hotel
frowning
that
fellow
he
muttered
is
a
coward
and
we
expect
help
from
him
if
trouble
comes
no
trouble
came
that
night
however
and
in
the
early
morning
while
the
sky
was
still
reddened
by
the
rising
sun
they
were
off
again
following
more
closely
now
the
railroad
as
rocky
defiles
began
to
loom
up
before
them
by
the
zigzag
course
they
were
obliged
to
take
it
was
ninety
miles
to
gallup
and
this
they
easily
made
despite
the
growing
steepness
of
the
mountain
road
here
was
the
famous
continental
divide
and
the
state
of
arizona
lay
just
beyond
the
continental
divide
is
the
ridge
that
separates
the
streams
tributary
to
the
atlantic
ocean
from
those
tributary
to
the
pacific
so
that
after
crossing
it
one
might
well
feel
that
at
last
the
east
was
left
behind
and
the
great
west
with
its
romance
now
faced
him
they
came
to
the
little
town
in
time
to
see
the
gorgeous
sunset
from
this
the
highest
point
of
the
rockies
and
especially
to
myrtle
who
had
traveled
so
little
was
the
sight
impressive
and
awe
inspiring
there
was
a
small
but
fairly
good
hotel
in
the
place
and
after
supper
patsy
and
beth
went
out
for
a
stroll
being
much
interested
in
the
mexicans
and
still
darker
indians
who
constituted
far
the
larger
part
of
the
population
the
party
had
everywhere
met
with
respect
from
these
people
who
although
curious
were
silent
and
so
uncle
john
and
the
major
deep
in
a
political
argument
on
the
hotel
porch
had
no
thought
of
danger
when
they
saw
the
two
girls
start
away
arm
in
arm
the
sky
was
still
aglow
although
the
sun
had
set
and
in
the
subdued
light
the
coarse
adobe
huts
and
rickety
frame
dwellings
were
endowed
with
a
picturesque
appearance
they
did
not
really
possess
beth
and
patsy
came
to
the
end
of
the
main
street
rather
suddenly
and
stood
a
moment
looking
at
the
shadows
cast
by
the
rocky
cliffs
near
by
some
of
the
peaks
had
snow
upon
them
and
there
was
a
chill
in
the
air
now
that
the
sun
had
withdrawn
its
warmth
the
girls
turned
presently
and
took
another
route
that
might
bring
them
quicker
to
the
hotel
but
had
only
proceeded
a
short
way
when
in
passing
a
rather
solitary
adobe
structure
a
man
stepped
from
the
shadow
of
the
wall
and
confronted
them
he
wore
a
red
flannel
shirt
and
a
broad
sombrero
the
latter
scarcely
covering
his
dark
evil
features
the
cousins
stopped
short
then
beth
whispered
let
go
the
other
way
but
as
they
were
about
to
turn
the
mexican
drew
a
revolver
and
said
in
harsh
uneven
english
you
halt
keep
or
i
shoot
what
do
you
want
asked
beth
quietly
money
all
you
got
all
you
got
give
quick
or
i
shoot
as
they
stood
hesitating
a
sound
of
footsteps
was
heard
and
someone
approached
quickly
from
behind
them
patsy
looked
hurriedly
around
and
saw
wampus
he
was
walking
with
his
thin
little
form
bent
and
his
hands
deep
in
his
trousers
pockets
incidentally
wampus
was
smoking
the
stub
of
a
cigar
as
was
his
custom
when
off
duty
the
mexican
saw
him
but
marking
his
small
size
and
mild
manner
did
not
flinch
from
his
position
with
one
revolver
still
leveled
at
the
girls
he
drew
another
from
a
hip
pocket
and
turned
it
upon
wampus
you
stop
halt
he
exclaimed
fiercely
wampus
did
not
halt
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
bandit
ugly
features
still
puffing
his
cigar
and
with
hands
in
his
pockets
he
walked
deliberately
past
patsy
and
beth
and
straight
up
to
the
muzzles
of
the
revolvers
stop
cried
the
mexican
and
again
stop
wampus
stopped
when
one
revolver
nearly
touched
his
nose
and
another
covered
his
body
slowly
he
drew
one
hand
from
his
pocket
and
grasped
the
barrel
of
the
nearest
weapon
let
him
go
he
said
not
raising
his
voice
the
man
stared
into
the
little
chauffeur
eyes
and
released
his
hold
of
the
revolver
wampus
looked
at
it
grunted
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
now
the
other
gun
he
said
the
fellow
drew
back
and
half
turned
as
if
to
escape
no
no
said
wampus
as
if
annoyed
you
give
me
gun
see
i
am
wampus
sheepishly
enough
the
mexican
surrendered
the
other
weapon
now
turn
aroun
an
go
to
hotel
commanded
the
chauffeur
the
man
obeyed
wampus
turned
to
the
girls
who
were
now
not
only
relieved
but
on
the
verge
of
laughter
and
said
deprecatingly
do
not
be
scare
for
poor
man
he
make
no
harm
he
jus
try
a
goozle
no
dare
shoot
here
in
town
then
come
i
go
back
with
you
silently
they
accompanied
him
along
the
lane
the
mexican
keeping
in
front
and
looking
around
from
time
to
time
to
see
if
they
followed
a
short
distance
from
the
hotel
wampus
gave
a
queer
whistle
which
brought
the
bandit
cringing
to
his
side
without
ado
he
handed
the
fellow
his
two
revolvers
and
said
calmly
go
the
mexican
went
along
briskly
and
the
dusk
soon
swallowed
him
up
thank
you
wampus
said
patsy
gratefully
you
saved
us
from
a
dreadful
experience
oh
that
snapping
his
fingers
scornfully
he
not
a
good
for
he
too
much
afraid
i
have
no
gun
for
i
do
not
like
gun
still
if
i
not

he
make
you
give
him
money

trinkets

very
kind

beth
and
i
thank
you
as
much
as
patsy
does
if
you
had
not
arrived
just
when
you
did
i
might
have
killed
the
man
you
inquired
wampus
doubtingly
yes
she
showed
him
a
small
revolver
which
she
carried
in
the
pocket
of
her
jacket
i
can
shoot
wampus
the
little
chauffeur
grinned
then
looked
grave
and
shook
his
head
it
make
funny
world
these
day
said
he
one
time
girl
from
city
would

a

he
said
more
cheerfully

be
there

chapter
viii
among
the
indians
little
myrtle
grew
brighter
day
by
day
she
even
grew
merry
and
developed
a
fine
sense
of
humor
showing
new
traits
in
her
hitherto
undeveloped
character
the
girl
never
mentioned
her
injury
nor
admitted
that
she
suffered
any
pain
even
when
directly
questioned
indeed
she
was
not
uncomfortable
during
that
splendid
automobile
ride
over
mountain
and
plain
into
the
paradise
of
the
glowing
west
never
before
in
her
life
had
myrtle
enjoyed
an
outing
except
for
an
hour
or
two
in
a
city
park
never
before
had
she
known
a
friend
to
care
for
her
and
sympathize
honestly
with
her
griefs
therefore
this
experience
was
so
exquisitely
delightful
that
her
responsive
heart
nearly
burst
with
gratitude
pretty
thoughts
came
to
her
that
she
had
never
had
before
her
luxurious
surroundings
led
her
to
acquire
dainty
ways
and
a
composed
and
demeanor
our
rosebud
is
unfolding
petal
by
petal
and
beginning
to
bloom
gloriously
said
patsy
to
sympathetic
uncle
john
could
anyone
be
more
sweet
or
lovely
perhaps
almost
any
girl
situated
as
myrtle
dean
was
would
have
blossomed
under
similar
influences
certain
it
was
that
uncle
john
came
to
have
a
tender
affection
for
the
poor
child
while
the
big
heart
had
warmed
from
the
first
toward
the
injured
girl
beth
and
patsy
were
devoted
to
their
new
friend
and
even
mumbles
was
never
so
happy
as
when
myrtle
would
hold
and
caress
him
naturally
the
former
waif
responded
freely
to
all
this
wealth
of
affection
and
strove
to
be
companionable
and
cheery
that
they
might
forget
as
much
as
possible
her
physical
helplessness
mumbles
was
not
the
least
important
member
of
the
party
but
proved
a
constant
source
of
amusement
to
all
in
the
novel
domains
they
now
traversed
the
small
dog
excitable
nature
led
him
to
investigate
everything
that
seemed
suspicious
but
he
was
so
cowardly
in
spite
of
this
that
once
when
patsy
let
him
down
to
chase
a
gopher
or
prairie
dog
they
were
not
sure
which
the
animal
turned
at
bay
and
sent
mumbles
retreating
with
his
stubby
tail
between
his
legs
his
comradeship
for
wampus
surprised
them
all
the
canadian
would
talk
seriously
to
the
dog
and
tell
it
long
stories
as
if
the
creature
could
understand
every
word
which
perhaps
he
did
mumbles
would
sit
up
between
the
driver
and
patsy
and
listen
attentively
which
encouraged
wampus
to
talk
until
patsy
in
turned
and
tossed
the
fuzzy
animal
in
to
myrtle
who
was
always
glad
to
receive
him
but
patsy
did
not
always
sit
on
the
front
seat
that
honor
was
divided
among
them
all
by
turns
except
the
major
who
did
not
care
for
the
place
yet
i
think
patsy
rode
there
oftener
than
anyone
else
and
it
came
to
be
considered
her
special
privilege
because
she
had
first
claimed
it
the
major
after
the
incident
at
gallup
did
not
scorn
wampus
so
openly
as
before
but
he
still
reserved
a
suspicion
that
the
fellow
was
at
heart
a
coward
and
a
blusterer
the
chauffeur
sole
demerit
in
the
eyes
of
the
others
was
his
tremendous
egotism
the
proud
remark
i
am
wampus
was
constantly
on
his
lips
and
he
had
wonderful
tales
to
tell
to
all
who
would
listen
of
his
past
experiences
in
every
one
of
which
he
unblushingly
figured
as
the
hero
but
he
really
handled
the
big
touring
car
in
an
admirable
manner
and
when
one
afternoon
a
tire
was
punctured
by
a
cactus
spine
by
the
roadside
their
first
accident
they
could
not
fail
to
admire
the
dexterous
manner
in
which
he
changed
the
tube
for
a
new
one
from
gallup
they
took
a
wagon
road
to
fort
defiance
in
the
navajo
indian
reservation
but
the
navajos
proved
uninteresting
people
not
even
occupying
themselves
in
weaving
the
famous
navajo
blankets
which
are
now
mostly
made
in
philadelphia
even
patsy
who
had
longed
to
see
the
indians
in
their
native
haunts
was
disgusted
by
their
filth
and
laziness
and
the
party
expected
no
better
results
when
they
came
to
the
adjoining
moki
reservation
here
however
they
were
happily
disappointed
for
they
arrived
at
the
pueblo
of
oraibi
one
of
the
prettiest
villages
on
the
mesa
on
the
eve
of
one
of
their
characteristic
snake
dances
and
decided
to
remain
over
night
and
see
the
performance
now
i
am
not
sure
but
the
snake
dance
was
so
opportune
because
uncle
john
had
a
private
interview
with
the
native
chieftain
at
which
the
head
snake
priest
and
the
head
antelope
priest
of
the
tribe
were
present
these
indians
spoke
excellent
english
and
the
chief
loved
the
white
man
money
so
a
ceremony
that
has
been
held
during
the
month
of
august
for
many
centuries
long
before
the
spanish
conquistadors
found
this
interesting
tribe
was
found
to
be
on
tap
for
that
very
evening
the
girls
were
tremendously
excited
at
the
prospect
and
wampus
was
ordered
to
prepare
camp
for
the
night
the
first
they
had
spent
in
their
automobile
and
away
from
a
hotel
not
only
was
the
interior
of
the
roomy
limousine
converted
into
sleeping
quarters
for
the
three
girls
but
a
tent
was
spread
one
side
fastened
to
the
car
while
the
other
was
staked
to
the
ground
three
wire
folding
cots
came
from
some
hidden
place
beneath
the
false
bottom
of
the
car
with
bedding
enough
to
supply
them
and
these
were
for
the
use
of
the
men
in
the
tent
the
two
bedrooms
having
been
thus
prepared
wampus
lighted
the
tiny
gasoline
stove
over
which
patsy
and
beth
enthusiastically
cooked
the
supper
beth
wanted
to
newburg
the
tinned
lobster
and
succeeded
in
creaming
it
very
nicely
they
had
potato
chips
coffee
and
toasted
holland
rusks
as
well
and
all
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
improvised
meal
their
camp
had
been
pitched
just
at
the
outskirts
of
the
indian
village
but
the
snake
dance
was
to
take
place
in
a
rocky
glen
some
distance
away
from
the
pueblo
and
so
uncle
john
instructed
wampus
to
remain
and
guard
their
outfit
as
the
moki
are
notorious
thieves
they
left
the
lean
little
chauffeur
perched
upon
the
driver
seat
smoking
one
of
his
stogie
cigars
and
with
mumbles
sitting
gravely
beside
him
myrtle
hobbled
on
her
crutches
between
beth
and
patsy
who
carried
little
tin
lanterns
made
with
lamp
chimneys
that
had
candles
inside
them
they
first
visited
the
chief
who
announced
that
the
ceremonies
were
about
to
begin
at
a
word
from
this
imposing
leader
a
big
indian
caught
up
myrtle
and
easily
carried
her
on
his
shoulder
as
if
she
were
light
as
a
feather
leading
the
way
to
the
rocky
amphitheatre
here
were
assembled
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
forming
a
wide
circle
around
the
performers
the
snakes
were
in
a
pit
dug
in
the
center
of
the
space
over
which
a
few
branches
had
been
placed
this
is
called
the
kisi
these
unique
and
horrifying
snake
dances
of
the
moki
have
been
described
so
often
that
i
need
not
speak
of
this
performance
in
detail
before
it
was
half
over
the
girls
wished
they
were
back
in
their
automobile
but
the
major
whispered
that
for
them
to
leave
would
cause
great
offense
to
the
indians
and
might
result
in
trouble
the
dance
is
supposedly
a
religious
one
in
honor
of
the
rain
god
and
at
first
the
snakes
were
not
used
but
as
the
dancers
became
wrought
up
and
excited
by
their
antics
one
by
one
they
reached
within
the
kisi
and
drew
out
a
snake
allowing
the
reptiles
to
coil
around
their
almost
naked
bodies
and
handling
them
with
seeming
impunity
a
few
were
harmless
species
as
bull
snakes
and
arrow
snakes
but
mostly
the
moki
used
rattlesnakes
which
are
native
to
the
mesa
and
its
rocky
cliffs
some
travelers
have
claimed
that
the
fangs
of
the
rattlers
are
secretly
withdrawn
before
the
creatures
are
handled
but
this
has
been
proved
to
be
untrue
the
most
accepted
theory
is
that
the
snakes
are
never
permitted
to
coil
and
can
not
strike
unless
coiled
while
the
weird
chanting
and
graceful
undulating
motions
of
the
dancers
in
some
manner
charms
or
intoxicates
the
serpents
which
are
not
aroused
to
antagonism
occasionally
however
one
of
the
moki
priests
is
bitten
in
which
case
nothing
is
done
to
aid
him
and
he
is
permitted
to
die
it
being
considered
a
judgment
of
the
rain
god
for
some
sin
he
has
committed
the
barbaric
rites
seemed
more
picturesque
as
well
as
more
revolting
in
that
they
took
place
by
the
flickering
light
of
torches
and
bonfires
in
a
rock
strewn
plain
usually
claimed
by
nature
when
the
dancers
were
more
frenzied
they
held
the
squirming
serpents
in
their
mouths
by
the
middle
and
allowed
them
to
coil
around
their
necks
dancing
wildly
the
while
the
whole
affair
was
so
nauseating
and
offensive
that
as
soon
as
it
was
possible
the
visitors
withdrew
and
retired
to
their
camp
it
was
now
almost
midnight
but
the
path
was
lighted
by
the
little
lanterns
they
carried
as
they
approached
the
automobile
uncle
john
was
disturbed
not
to
see
wampus
at
his
post
a
light
showed
from
the
front
of
the
car
but
the
chauffeur
seemed
to
be
missing
coming
nearer
however
they
soon
were
greeted
by
a
joyous
barking
from
mumbles
and
discovered
wampus
squatting
upon
the
ground
puffing
at
the
small
end
of
the
cigar
and
seeming
quite
composed
and
tranquil
what
are
you
doing
there
demanded
the
major
raising
his
lantern
the
better
to
light
the
scene
i
play
jailer
grunted
wampus
without
moving
him
want
to
steal
mumble
he
make
bark
noise
for
me
i
steal
too
i
steal
injun
a
dusky
form
prone
upon
the
ground
began
to
squirm
under
wampus
who
was
then
discovered
to
be
sitting
upon
a
big
indian
and
holding
him
prisoner
the
chauffeur
partly
an
indian
himself
knew
well
how
to
manage
his
captive
and
quieted
the
fellow
by
squeezing
his
throat
with
his
broad
stubby
fingers
how
long
have
you
had
him
there
inquired
uncle
john
looking
at
the
discomfited
brave
curiously
about
an
hour
was
the
reply
let
him
go
then
we
have
no
prison
handy
and
the
man
has
perhaps
been
punished
enough
i
have
wait
to
ask
permission
to
kill
him
said
wampus
solemnly
he
know
english
talk
an
i
have
told
him
he
is
to
die
i
have
describe
sir
several
torture
we
make
on
injun
who
steal
which
make
him
think
he
die
several
time
so
he
is
now
prepare
for
the
worst
the
indiam
squirmed
again
and
with
a
sigh
wampus
arose
and
set
him
free
see
he
said
you
are
save
only
by
mercy
of
great
white
chief
you
ver
lucky
injun
but
great
white
chief
will
leave
only
one
eye
here
when
he
go
away
if
you
try
to
steal
again
the
eye
will
see
an
then
the
torture
i
have
describe
will
be
yours
i
am
wampus
i
have
spoke
the
indian
listened
intently
and
then
slunk
away
into
the
darkness
without
reply
the
night
had
no
further
event
and
in
spite
of
their
unusual
experiences
all
slept
excellently
and
awoke
in
the
morning
refreshed
and
ready
for
new
adventures
chapter
ix
nature
masterpiece
from
the
reservation
to
the
grand
canyon
of
the
colorado
was
not
far
but
there
was
no
crosscut
and
so
they
were
obliged
to
make
a
wide
detour
nearly
to
williams
before
striking
the
road
that
wound
upward
to
the
world
greatest
wonder
slowly
and
tediously
the
big
car
climbed
the
miserable
trail
to
the
rim
of
the
grand
canyon
it
was
night
when
they
arrived
for
they
had
timed
it
that
way
having
been
told
of
the
marvelous
beauty
of
the
canyon
by
moonlight
but
unfortunately
the
sky
filled
with
clouds
toward
evening
and
they
came
to
bright
angel
their
destination
in
a
drizzling
rain
and
total
darkness
the
major
was
fearful
wampus
might
run
them
into
the
canyon
but
the
machine
powerful
searchlights
showed
the
way
clearly
and
by
sticking
to
the
road
they
finally
drew
up
before
an
imposing
hotel
such
as
you
might
wonder
to
find
in
so
remote
a
spot
eagerly
enough
they
escaped
from
the
automobile
where
they
had
been
shut
in
and
entered
the
spacious
lobby
of
the
hotel
where
a
merry
throng
of
tourists
had
gathered
dinner
and
bed
said
patsy
decidedly
i
all
tired
out
and
poor
myrtle
is
worn
to
a
frazzle
there
no
chance
of
seeing
the
canyon
and
as
for
the
dancing
card
playing
and
promiscuous
gaiety
it
does
appeal
much
to
a
weary
traveler
the
girls
were
shown
to
a
big
room
at
the
front
of
the
hotel
having
two
beds
in
it
a
smaller
was
given
to
myrtle
while
patsy
and
beth
shared
the
larger
apartment
it
seems
the
hotel
big
as
it
was
was
fairly
filled
with
guests
the
railway
running
three
trains
a
day
to
the
wonderful
canyon
but
uncle
john
nieces
did
not
mind
occupying
the
same
room
which
was
comfortably
and
even
luxuriously
furnished
a
noise
of
footsteps
along
the
corridor
disturbed
patsy
at
an
early
hour
she
opened
her
eyes
to
find
the
room
dimly
lighted
as
by
the
first
streaks
of
dawn
and
sleepily
arose
to
raise
the
window
shade
and
see
if
day
was
breaking
her
hand
still
upraised
to
guide
the
shade
the
girl
stood
as
motionless
as
if
turned
to
stone
with
a
long
drawn
gasping
breath
she
cried
oh
beth
and
then
stood
staring
at
what
is
undoubtedly
the
most
entrancing
the
most
awe
inspiring
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
magnificent
spectacle
that
mortal
eye
has
ever
beheld
sunrise
above
the
grand
canyon
of
arizona
the
master
painters
of
the
world
have
gathered
in
this
spot
in
a
vain
attempt
to
transfer
the
wondrous
coloring
of
the
canyon
to
canvas
authors
famed
for
their
eloquent
command
of
language
have
striven
as
vainly
to
tell
to
others
what
their
own
eyes
have
seen
how
their
senses
have
been
thrilled
and
their
souls
uplifted
by
the
marvel
that
god
hand
has
wrought
it
can
never
be
pictured
it
can
never
be
described
only
those
who
have
stood
as
patricia
doyle
stood
that
morning
and
viewed
the
sublime
masterpiece
of
nature
can
realize
what
those
homely
words
the
grand
canyon
mean
grand
it
is
well
named
since
no
other
adjective
can
better
describe
it
that
much
abused
one
may
well
be
accepted
to
incompletely
serve
its
purpose
beth
joined
her
cousin
at
the
window
and
was
instantly
as
awed
and
absorbed
as
patsy
neither
remembered
myrtle
just
then
but
fortunately
their
friend
had
left
the
connecting
door
of
their
rooms
ajar
and
hearing
them
stirring
came
in
to
see
if
anything
had
happened
she
found
the
two
cousins
staring
intently
from
the
window
and
went
to
the
second
window
herself
thus
witnessing
the
spectacle
in
all
its
glory
even
after
the
magnificent
coloring
of
sunrise
had
faded
the
sight
was
one
to
rivet
the
attention
the
hotel
seemed
built
at
the
very
edge
of
the
canyon
and
at
their
feet
the
ground
appeared
to
fall
away
and
a
great
gulf
yawned
that
was
tinted
on
all
its
diverse
sides
with
hues
that
rivaled
those
of
the
rainbow
across
the
chasm
they
could
clearly
see
the
trees
and
hills
yet
these
were
fully
thirteen
miles
distant
for
here
is
one
of
the
widest
portions
of
the
great
abyss
i
going
to
dress
said
beth
breaking
the
silence
at
last
it
seems
a
sin
to
stay
cooped
up
in
here
when
such
a
glorious
panorama
is
at
one
feet
the
others
did
not
reply
in
words
but
they
all
began
to
dress
together
with
nervous
haste
and
then
made
their
way
down
to
the
canyon
brink
others
were
before
them
standing
upon
the
ample
porches
in
interested
groups
but
such
idleness
would
not
content
our
girls
who
trooped
away
for
a
more
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
wonderful
gorge
oh
how
small
how
terribly
small
i
am
cried
patsy
lost
in
the
immensity
of
the
canyon
extent
but
this
is
a
common
cry
of
travelers
visiting
bright
angel
you
might
place
a
baker
dozen
of
the
huge
falls
of
niagara
in
the
grand
canyon
and
scarcely
notice
they
were
there
all
the
vast
cathedrals
of
europe
set
upon
its
plateau
would
seem
like
pebbles
when
viewed
from
the
brink
the
thing
is
simply
incomprehensible
to
those
who
have
not
seen
it
presently
uncle
john
and
the
major
came
out
to
join
them
and
they
all
wandered
along
the
edge
until
they
came
to
a
huge
rock
that
jutted
out
far
over
the
monster
gulf
on
the
furthermost
point
of
this
rock
standing
with
his
feet
at
the
very
brink
was
a
tall
thin
man
his
back
toward
them
it
seemed
a
fearful
thing
to
do
to
stand
where
the
slightest
slip
would
send
him
reeling
into
the
abyss
it
like
tempting
fate
whispered
patsy
a
safe
distance
away
i
wish
he
would
step
back
a
little
as
if
he
had
overheard
her
the
man
half
turned
and
calmly
examined
the
group
his
eyes
were
an
almost
colorless
blue
his
features
destitute
of
any
expression
by
his
dress
he
seemed
if
not
prosperous
yet
there
was
a
hint
of
melancholy
in
his
poise
and
about
him
a
definite
atmosphere
of
loneliness
after
that
one
deliberate
look
he
turned
again
and
faced
the
canyon
paying
no
attention
to
the
interested
little
party
that
hovered
far
enough
from
the
edge
to
avoid
any
possible
danger
oh
dear
whispered
myrtle
clinging
to
beth
arm
with
trembling
fingers
i
afraid
he
going
to
to
commit
suicide
nonsense
answered
beth
turning
pale
nevertheless
the
figure
was
motionless
as
before
uncle
john
and
the
major
started
along
the
path
but
as
beth
attempted
to
follow
them
myrtle
broke
away
from
her
and
hobbled
eagerly
on
her
crutches
toward
the
stranger
she
did
not
go
quite
to
the
end
of
the
jutting
rock
but
stopped
some
feet
away
and
called
in
a
low
intense
voice
do
the
man
turned
again
with
no
more
expression
in
his
eyes
or
face
than
before
he
looked
at
myrtle
steadily
a
moment
then
turned
and
slowly
left
the
edge
walking
to
firm
ground
and
back
toward
the
hotel
without
another
glance
at
the
girl
i
so
ashamed
said
myrtle
tears
of
vexation
in
her
eyes
as
she
rejoined
her
friends
but
somehow
i
felt
i
must
warn
him
it
was
an
impulse
i
just
could
resist
why
no
harm
resulted
in
any
event
my
dear
returned
beth
i
would
think
of
it
again
they
took
so
long
a
walk
that
all
were
nearly
famished
when
they
returned
to
the
hotel
for
breakfast
of
course
patsy
and
beth
wanted
to
go
down
bright
angel
trail
into
the
depths
of
the
canyon
for
that
is
the
thing
all
adventurous
spirits
love
to
do
i
too
fat
for
such
foolishness
said
uncle
john
so
i
stay
up
here
and
amuse
myrtle
the
major
decided
to
go
to
look
after
our
patsy
so
the
three
joined
the
long
line
of
daring
tourists
and
being
mounted
on
docile
burros
followed
the
guide
down
the
trail
myrtle
and
uncle
john
spent
the
morning
on
the
porch
of
the
hotel
at
breakfast
the
girl
had
noticed
the
tall
man
they
had
encountered
at
the
canyon
edge
quietly
engaged
in
eating
at
a
small
table
in
a
far
corner
of
the
great
dining
room
during
the
forenoon
he
came
from
the
hotel
to
the
porch
and
for
a
time
stood
looking
far
away
over
the
canyon
aroused
to
sympathy
by
the
loneliness
of
this
silent
person
uncle
john
left
his
chair
and
stood
beside
him
at
the
railing
it
a
wonderful
sight
sir
he
remarked
in
his
brisk
sociable
way
wonderful
indeed
for
a
moment
there
was
no
reply
it
seems
to
call
one
said
the
man
at
length
as
if
to
himself
it
calls
one
it
a
wonder
to
me
it
does
call
more
people
to
see
it
observed
merrick
cheerfully
think
of
this
magnificent
thing
greater
and
grander
than
anything
the
old
world
can
show
being
here
right
in
the
heart
of
america
almost
and
so
few
rush
to
see
it
why
in
time
to
come
sir
he
added
enthusiastically
not
to
have
seen
the
grand
canyon
of
arizona
will
be
an
admission
of
inferiority
it
it
the
biggest
thing
in
all
the
world
the
stranger
made
no
reply
he
had
not
even
glanced
at
uncle
john
now
he
slowly
turned
and
stared
fixedly
at
myrtle
for
a
moment
till
she
cast
down
her
eyes
blushing
then
he
the
hotel
nor
was
he
again
seen
by
them
the
little
man
was
indignant
at
the
snub
rejoining
myrtle
he
said
to
her
that
fellow
was
worth
saving
if
you
really
saved
him
my
dear
he
says
the
canyon
calls
one
and
for
all
i
care
he
may
go
to
the
bottom
by
any
route
he
pleases
which
speech
showed
that
gentle
kindly
merrick
was
really
annoyed
but
a
moment
later
he
was
all
smiles
again
and
myrtle
found
him
a
delightful
companion
because
he
knew
so
well
how
to
read
people
thoughts
and
if
they
were
sad
had
a
tactful
way
of
cheering
them
the
girls
and
the
major
returned
from
their
trip
to
the
plateau
full
of
rapture
at
their
unique
experiences
i
would
have
missed
it
for
a
million
dollars
cried
the
major
but
he
added
and
you
could
hire
me
to
go
again
for
two
million
it
was
great
said
patsy
but
i
tuckered
out
i
had
nineteen
narrow
escapes
from
sudden
death
began
beth
but
her
cousin
interrupted
her
by
saying
so
had
everyone
in
the
party
and
if
the
canyon
had
caved
in
we
all
be
dead
long
ago
stop
your
chattering
now
and
get
ready
for
dinner
i
nearly
starved
next
morning
they
took
a
farewell
view
of
the
beautiful
scene
and
then
climbed
into
their
automobile
to
continue
their
journey
many
of
the
tourists
had
wondered
at
their
temerity
in
making
such
a
long
trip
through
a
poorly
settled
country
in
a
motor
car
and
had
plied
them
with
questions
and
warnings
but
they
were
thoroughly
enjoying
this
outing
and
nothing
very
disagreeable
had
happened
to
them
so
far
i
am
sure
that
on
this
bright
glorious
morning
you
could
not
have
hired
any
one
of
the
party
to
abandon
the
automobile
and
finish
the
trip
by
train
chapter
x
a
coyote
serenade
the
roads
were
bad
enough
they
were
especially
bad
west
of
williams
just
now
an
association
of
automobile
tourists
has
been
formed
to
create
a
boulevard
route
through
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
coast
but
at
the
time
of
this
story
no
attention
had
been
given
the
roads
of
the
far
west
and
only
the
paths
of
the
rancheros
from
town
to
town
served
as
guides
on
leaving
williams
they
turned
south
so
as
to
avoid
the
more
severe
mountain
roads
and
a
fine
run
through
a
rather
uninteresting
country
brought
them
to
prescott
on
the
eve
of
the
second
day
after
leaving
the
canyon
here
they
decided
to
take
a
rest
as
it
was
sunday
and
the
hotel
was
comfortable
but
monday
morning
they
renewed
their
journey
and
headed
southwesterly
across
the
alkali
plains
called
mesa
for
parker
on
the
boundary
line
between
arizona
and
california
towns
of
any
sort
were
very
scarce
in
this
section
and
the
country
was
wild
and
often
barren
of
vegetation
for
long
stretches
there
were
some
extensive
ranches
however
as
this
is
the
section
favored
for
settlement
by
a
class
of
englishmen
called
remittance
men
these
are
mostly
the
black
sheep
or
outcasts
of
titled
families
who
having
got
into
trouble
of
some
sort
at
home
are
sent
to
america
to
isolate
themselves
on
western
ranches
where
they
receive
monthly
or
quarterly
remittances
of
money
to
support
them
the
remittance
men
are
poor
farmers
as
a
rule
they
are
idle
and
lazy
except
when
it
comes
to
riding
hunting
and
similar
sports
their
greatest
industry
is
cattle
raising
yet
these
foreign
born
cowboys
constitute
an
entirely
different
class
from
those
of
american
extraction
found
in
texas
and
on
the
plains
of
the
central
west
they
are
educated
and
to
an
extent
cultured
being
gentlemen
born
but
sad
backsliders
in
the
practise
of
the
profession
because
other
ranchers
hesitate
to
associate
with
them
they
congregate
in
settlements
of
their
own
and
here
in
arizona
on
the
banks
of
the
bill
williams
branch
of
the
colorado
river
they
form
almost
the
total
population
our
friends
had
hoped
to
make
the
little
town
of
gerton
for
the
night
but
the
road
was
so
bad
that
wampus
was
obliged
to
drive
slowly
and
carefully
and
so
could
not
make
very
good
time
accidents
began
to
happen
too
doubtless
clue
to
the
hard
usage
the
machine
had
received
first
a
spring
broke
and
wampus
was
obliged
to
halt
long
enough
to
clamp
it
together
with
stout
steel
braces
an
hour
later
the
front
tire
was
punctured
by
cactus
spines
which
were
thick
upon
the
road
such
delays
seriously
interfered
with
their
day
mileage
toward
sunset
uncle
john
figured
from
the
information
he
had
received
at
prescott
that
they
were
yet
thirty
miles
from
gerton
and
so
he
decided
to
halt
and
make
camp
while
there
was
yet
sufficient
daylight
remaining
to
do
so
conveniently
we
might
hunt
for
a
ranch
house
and
beg
for
shelter
said
he
but
from
the
stories
i
heard
of
the
remittance
men
i
am
sure
we
will
enjoy
ourselves
better
if
we
rely
entirely
upon
our
own
resources
the
girls
were
of
course
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
such
an
experience
for
the
silent
solitary
mesa
made
them
feel
they
were
indeed
in
the
wilds
of
the
great
american
desert
the
afternoon
had
been
hot
and
the
ride
dusty
but
there
was
now
a
cooler
feeling
in
the
air
since
the
sun
had
fallen
low
in
the
horizon
they
carried
their
own
drinking
water
kept
in
thermos
bottles
and
uncle
john
also
had
a
thermos
tub
filled
with
small
squares
of
ice
this
luxury
in
connection
with
their
ample
supply
of
provisions
enabled
the
young
women
to
prepare
a
supper
not
to
be
surpassed
in
any
modern
hotel
the
soup
came
from
one
can
the
curried
chicken
from
another
while
artichokes
peas
asparagus
and
plum
pudding
shed
their
tin
coverings
to
complete
the
meal
fruits
cheese
and
biscuits
they
had
in
abundance
so
there
was
no
hardship
in
camping
out
on
a
deserted
arizona
as
far
as
food
was
concerned
the
interior
of
the
limousine
when
made
into
berths
for
the
three
girls
was
as
safe
and
cosy
as
a
pullman
sleeping
coach
only
the
men
quarters
the
tent
was
in
any
way
open
to
invasion
after
the
meal
was
ended
and
the
things
washed
and
put
away
they
all
sat
on
folding
camp
chairs
outside
the
little
tent
and
enjoyed
the
intense
silence
surrounding
them
the
twilight
gradually
deepened
into
darkness
wampus
kept
one
of
the
searchlights
lit
to
add
an
element
of
cheerfulness
to
the
scene
and
myrtle
was
prevailed
upon
to
sing
one
or
two
of
her
simple
songs
she
had
a
clear
sweet
voice
although
not
a
strong
one
and
they
all
especially
uncle
john
loved
to
hear
her
sing
afterward
they
talked
over
their
trip
and
the
anticipated
change
from
this
arid
region
to
the
verdure
of
california
until
suddenly
a
long
bloodcurdling
howl
broke
the
stillness
and
caused
them
one
and
all
to
start
from
their
seats
that
is
all
but
wampus
the
chauffeur
sitting
apart
with
his
black
cigar
in
his
mouth
merely
nodded
and
said
coyote
the
major
coughed
and
resumed
his
seat
uncle
john
stood
looking
into
the
darkness
as
if
trying
to
discern
the
creature
are
coyotes
considered
dangerous
he
asked
the
canadian
not
to
us
replied
wampus
sometime
if
one
man
be
out
on
mesa
alone
an
plenty
coyote
come
he
have
hard
fight
for
life
coyote
is
wild
dog
he
is
big
coward
unless
pretty
hungry
if
i
leave
light
burn
he
never
come
near
us
then
let
it
burn
all
night
said
merrick
there
he
goes
again
and
another
with
him
what
a
horrible
wail
it
is
i
rather
like
it
said
patsy
with
her
accustomed
calmness
it
is
certainly
an
added
experience
to
be
surrounded
by
coyotes
probably
our
trip
would
have
been
complete
without
it
a
little
of
that
serenade
will
suffice
me
admitted
beth
as
the
howls
grew
nearer
and
redoubled
in
volume
myrtle
eyes
were
big
and
earnest
she
was
not
afraid
but
there
was
something
uncanny
in
being
surrounded
by
such
savage
creatures
nearer
and
nearer
sounded
the
howls
until
it
was
easy
to
see
a
dozen
fierce
eyes
gleaming
in
the
darkness
not
a
stone
throw
away
from
the
camp
i
guess
you
girls
had
better
go
to
bed
remarked
uncle
john
a
bit
nervously
there
no
danger
you
know
none
at
all
let
the
brutes
howl
if
they
want
to
especially
as
we
ca
stop
them
but
you
are
tired
my
dears
and
i
like
to
see
you
settled
for
the
night
somewhat
reluctantly
they
entered
the
limousine
drew
the
curtains
and
prepared
for
bed
certainly
they
were
having
a
novel
experience
and
if
uncle
john
would
feel
easier
to
have
them
listen
to
the
howling
coyotes
from
inside
the
limousine
instead
of
outside
they
could
not
well
object
to
his
request
presently
wampus
asked
the
major
for
his
revolver
and
on
obtaining
the
weapon
he
walked
a
few
paces
toward
the
coyotes
and
fired
a
shot
into
their
group
they
instantly
scattered
and
made
off
only
to
return
in
a
few
moments
to
their
former
position
will
they
continue
this
grand
opera
chorus
all
night
asked
uncle
john
perhap
said
wampus
they
hungry
an
smell
food
coyote
can
no
reason
if
he
could
he
know
ver
well
we
never
feed
him
the
next
time
we
come
this
way
let
us
fetch
along
a
ton
or
so
of
coyote
feed
suggested
the
major
i
wonder
what
the
poor
brutes
would
think
if
they
were
stuffed
full
for
once
in
their
lives
it
have
never
happen
sir
observed
wampus
shaking
his
head
gravely
coyote
all
born
hungry
he
live
hungry
he
die
hungry
if
ever
coyote
was
not
hungry
he
would
not
be
coyote
in
that
case
major
said
uncle
john
let
us
go
to
bed
and
try
to
sleep
perhaps
in
slumber
we
may
forget
these
howling
fiends
very
well
agreed
major
doyle
rising
to
enter
the
little
tent
wampus
unexpectedly
interposed
wait
called
the
little
chauffeur
jus
a
minute
if
you
please
while
the
major
and
merrick
stood
wondering
at
the
request
the
canadian
who
was
still
holding
the
revolver
in
one
hand
picked
a
steel
rod
from
the
rumble
of
the
automobile
and
pushing
aside
the
flap
of
the
little
tent
entered
the
of
the
car
burned
inside
dimly
lighting
the
place
the
major
was
about
to
follow
wampus
when
a
revolver
shot
arrested
him
this
sound
was
followed
by
a
quick
thumping
against
the
ground
of
the
steel
bar
and
then
wampus
emerged
from
the
tent
holding
a
dark
squirming
object
on
the
end
of
the
rod
extended
before
him
what
is
it
asked
merrick
somewhat
startled
rattlesnake
said
wampus
tossing
the
thing
into
the
sagebrush
i
see
him
crawl
in
tent
while
you
eat
supper
why
did
you
not
tell
us
cried
the
major
excitedly
i
thought
him
perhaps
crawl
out
again
him
sometime
do
that
but
no
mister
snake
he
go
sleep
in
tent
which
is
reserve
for
his
superior
i
say
nothing
for
i
do
not
wish
to
alarm
the
young
ladies
that
is
why
i
hold
the
dog
mumble
so
tight
for
he
small
eye
see
snake
too
fool
dog
wish
to
go
fight
him
rattlesnake
soon
eat
mumble
up
eh
but
never
mind
there
is
no
worry
i
am
wampus
an
i
am
here
you
go
to
bed
now
an
sleep
an
be
safe
he
said
this
rather
ostentatiously
and
for
that
reason
neither
of
the
others
praised
his
watchful
care
or
his
really
brave
act
that
wampus
was
proving
himself
a
capable
and
faithful
servant
even
the
major
was
forced
to
admit
yet
the
man
bombast
and
robbed
him
of
any
word
of
commendation
he
justly
earned
i
think
said
uncle
john
i
bunk
on
the
front
seat
short
you
see
and
will
just
about
curl
up
in
the
space
i
believe
snakes
do
not
climb
up
wheels
make
my
bed
on
the
front
seat
wampus
the
man
grinned
but
readily
obeyed
the
major
watched
him
thoughtfully
for
my
part
he
said
i
have
a
bed
made
on
top
the
roof
pshaw
said
uncle
john
you
scratch
the
paint
that
is
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
returned
the
major
you
roll
off
in
your
sleep
and
hurt
yourself
i
risk
that
sir
are
you
afraid
major
afraid
me
not
when
i
awake
john
but
what
to
prevent
more
of
those
vermin
from
crawling
into
the
tent
during
the
night
such
thing
very
unusual
remarked
wampus
placing
the
last
blanket
on
merrick
improvised
bed
perhaps
you
sleep
in
tent
a
week
never
see
another
rattler
just
the
same
concluded
the
major
i
have
my
bed
on
top
the
limousine
he
did
wampus
placing
blankets
and
a
pillow
for
him
without
a
word
of
protest
the
major
climbed
over
uncle
john
and
mounted
to
the
roof
of
the
car
which
sloped
to
either
side
but
was
broad
and
long
enough
to
accommodate
more
than
one
sleeper
being
an
old
campaigner
and
a
shrewd
tactician
major
doyle
made
two
blankets
into
rolls
which
he
placed
on
either
side
of
him
to
anchor
his
body
in
position
then
he
settled
himself
to
rest
beneath
the
brilliant
stars
while
the
coyotes
maintained
their
dismal
howling
but
a
tired
man
soon
becomes
insensible
to
even
such
annoyances
the
girls
having
entered
the
limousine
from
the
door
opposite
the
tent
were
all
unaware
of
the
rattlesnake
episode
and
supposed
the
shot
had
been
directed
against
the
coyotes
they
heard
the
major
climbing
upon
the
roof
but
did
not
demand
any
explanation
being
deep
in
those
bedtime
confidences
so
dear
to
all
girls
even
they
came
to
disregard
the
persistent
howls
of
the
coyotes
and
in
time
fell
asleep
wampus
did
not
seem
afraid
of
snakes
the
little
chauffeur
went
to
bed
in
the
tent
and
slept
soundly
upon
his
cot
until
daybreak
when
the
coyotes
withdrew
and
the
canadian
got
up
to
make
the
coffee
the
major
peered
over
the
edge
of
the
roof
to
watch
him
he
had
a
sleepy
look
about
his
eyes
as
if
he
had
not
rested
well
uncle
john
was
snoring
with
gentle
regularity
and
the
girls
were
still
asleep
wampus
said
the
major
do
you
know
the
proper
definition
of
a
fool
wampus
reflected
stirring
the
coffee
carefully
i
am
not
what
you
call
him
a
dictionairre
no
but
i
am
wampus
i
have
live
much
in
very
few
year
i
would
say
a
fool
is
man
who
think
he
is
wise
for
what
is
wise
nothing
the
major
felt
comforted
it
occurred
to
me
he
said
beginning
to
climb
down
from
the
roof
that
a
fool
was
a
man
who
left
a
good
home
for
this
uncomfortable
life
on
a
barren
desert
this
country
was
made
for
humans
it
belongs
to
the
coyotes
and
the
rattlesnakes
what
right
have
we
to
intrude
upon
them
then
wampus
did
not
reply
it
was
not
his
business
to
criticise
his
employers
chapter
xi
a
real
adventure
at
last
uncle
john
woke
up
when
the
major
inadvertently
placed
a
heel
upon
his
round
stomach
on
the
way
to
the
ground
the
chubby
little
millionaire
had
slept
excellently
and
was
in
a
genial
humor
this
morning
he
helped
wampus
fry
the
bacon
and
scramble
the
eggs
while
the
major
called
the
girls
it
proved
a
glorious
sunrise
and
the
air
was
full
of
pure
ozone
they
had
suffered
little
from
cold
during
the
trip
although
it
was
in
the
dead
of
winter
and
the
altitude
considerable
just
now
they
were
getting
closer
to
california
every
hour
and
when
they
descended
from
the
mesa
it
would
gradually
grow
warmer
they
were
all
becoming
expert
at
breaking
camp
and
preparing
for
the
road
beth
and
patsy
put
away
the
bedding
and
made
up
the
interior
of
the
limousine
for
traveling
the
major
and
uncle
john
folded
the
tent
and
packed
it
away
while
wampus
attended
to
the
dishes
and
tinware
and
then
looked
over
his
car
in
a
surprisingly
short
time
they
were
all
aboard
and
the
big
machine
was
gliding
over
the
faint
trail
the
mesa
was
not
a
flat
or
level
country
for
they
were
still
near
to
the
mountain
ranges
the
way
was
up
hill
and
down
in
gentle
slopes
and
soon
after
starting
they
breasted
the
brow
of
a
hill
and
were
confronted
by
half
a
dozen
mounted
men
who
seemed
as
much
astonished
at
the
encounter
as
they
were
it
being
an
event
to
meet
anyone
in
this
desolate
place
wampus
involuntarily
brought
the
car
to
a
halt
while
the
riders
lined
up
beside
it
and
stared
rather
rudely
at
the
party
they
were
dressed
as
cowboys
usually
are
with
flannel
shirts
chapelets
and
sombrero
hats
but
their
faces
were
not
rugged
nor
healthy
as
is
the
case
with
most
western
cowboys
but
bore
marks
of
dissipation
and
hard
living
remittance
men
whispered
wampus
uncle
john
nodded
he
had
heard
of
this
curious
class
especially
were
the
men
staring
at
the
three
pretty
feminine
faces
that
peered
from
the
interior
of
the
limousine
they
had
remained
silent
thus
far
but
now
one
of
them
a
fellow
with
dark
eyes
and
a
sallow
complexion
reined
his
horse
nearer
the
car
and
removed
his
hat
with
a
sweeping
gesture
that
was
not
ungraceful
a
merry
morning
to
you
fair
ladies
or
angels
i
much
misdoubt
which
we
have
chanced
upon
anyhow
welcome
to
hades
uncle
john
frowned
he
did
not
like
the
bantering
impudent
tone
beth
flushed
and
turned
aside
her
head
myrtle
shrank
back
in
her
corner
out
of
sight
but
patsy
glared
fixedly
at
the
speaker
with
an
expression
that
was
far
from
gracious
the
remittance
man
did
not
seem
daunted
by
this
decided
aversion
a
sneering
laugh
broke
from
his
companions
and
one
of
them
cried
back
up
algy
and
give
your
betters
a
chance
you
out
of
it
old
man
i
have
no
betters
he
retorted
then
turning
to
the
girls
again
and
ignoring
the
presence
of
the
men
accompanying
them
he
continued
beauteous
visions
since
you
have
wilfully
invaded
the
territory
of
hades
ranch
of
which
diabolical
domain
i
algernon
tobey
am
by
grace
of
his
satanic
majesty
the
master
i
invite
you
to
become
my
guests
and
participate
in
a
grand
ball
which
i
shall
give
this
evening
in
your
honor
his
comrades
laughed
again
and
one
of
them
shouted
good
for
you
algy
a
dance
that
the
thing
why
we
have
had
the
chance
of
a
dance
for
ages
said
another
approvingly
because
we
have
had
no
ladies
to
dance
with
explained
algy
but
here
are
three
come
to
our
rescue
perhaps
more
if
i
could
see
inside
that
barricade
and
they
can
not
refuse
us
the
pleasure
of
their
society
sir
said
major
doyle
stiffly
you
are
pleased
to
be
impertinent
ride
on
you
rascals
and
spare
us
further
sight
of
you
the
man
turned
upon
him
a
scowling
face
do
interfere
he
said
warningly
this
is
your
party
you
old
duffer
drive
ahead
wampus
commanded
uncle
john
wampus
had
to
get
out
and
crank
the
engines
which
he
calmly
proceeded
to
do
the
man
who
had
called
himself
algernon
tobey
perceived
his
intention
and
urged
his
pony
to
the
front
of
the
car
let
that
thing
alone
keep
your
hands
off
he
said
wampus
paid
no
attention
the
fellow
brought
his
riding
whip
down
sharply
on
the
chauffeur
shoulders
inflicting
a
stinging
blow
instantly
little
wampus
straightened
up
grasped
tobey
by
the
leg
and
with
a
swift
skillful
motion
jerked
him
from
his
horse
the
man
started
to
draw
his
revolver
but
in
an
instant
he
and
wampus
were
rolling
together
upon
the
ground
and
the
canadian
presently
came
uppermost
and
held
his
antagonist
firmly
between
his
knees
then
with
deliberation
he
raised
his
clinched
fist
and
thrust
it
forcibly
against
tobey
eye
repeating
the
impact
upon
his
nose
his
chin
and
his
cheek
in
a
succession
of
jarring
thumps
that
were
delivered
with
scientific
precision
algy
fairly
howled
kicking
and
struggling
to
be
free
none
of
his
comrades
offered
to
interfere
and
it
seemed
they
were
grimly
enjoying
the
punishment
that
was
being
inflicted
upon
their
leader
when
wampus
had
quite
finished
his
work
he
arose
adjusted
his
disarranged
collar
and
tie
and
proceeded
to
crank
the
engines
then
he
climbed
into
his
seat
and
started
the
car
with
a
sudden
bound
as
he
did
so
a
revolver
shot
rang
out
and
one
of
the
front
tires
pierced
by
the
bullet
ripped
itself
nearly
in
two
as
it
crumpled
up
a
shout
of
derisive
laughter
came
from
the
cowboys
algy
was
astride
his
pony
again
and
as
wampus
brought
the
damaged
car
to
a
stop
the
remittance
men
dashed
by
and
along
the
path
taking
the
same
direction
uncle
john
party
was
following
tobey
held
back
a
little
calling
out
au
revoir
i
shall
expect
you
all
at
my
party
i
going
now
to
get
the
fiddler
he
rejoined
his
comrades
then
and
they
all
clattered
away
until
a
roll
of
the
mesa
hid
them
from
sight
uncle
john
got
down
from
his
seat
to
assist
his
chauffeur
thank
you
wampus
he
said
perhaps
you
should
have
killed
him
while
you
had
the
opportunity
but
you
did
very
well
wampus
was
wrestling
with
the
tire
i
have
never
start
a
private
graveyard
he
replied
for
reason
i
am
afraid
to
hurt
anyone
but
i
am
wampus
if
mister
algy
he
dance
somebody
mus
lead
him
for
he
will
be
blind
i
never
met
such
a
lawless
brood
in
my
life
prowled
the
major
indignantly
if
they
were
in
new
york
they
be
put
behind
the
bars
in
two
minutes
but
they
are
in
arizona
in
the
wilderness
said
uncle
john
gravely
if
there
are
laws
here
such
people
do
not
respect
them
it
took
a
long
time
to
set
the
new
tire
and
inflate
it
for
the
outer
tube
was
torn
so
badly
that
an
extra
one
had
to
be
substituted
but
finally
the
task
was
accomplished
and
once
more
they
renewed
their
journey
now
that
they
were
alone
with
their
friends
the
girls
were
excitedly
gossiping
over
the
encounter
do
you
really
suppose
we
are
on
that
man
ground
his
ranch
as
he
calls
it
asked
myrtle
half
fearfully
why
i
suppose
someone
owns
all
this
ground
barren
as
it
is
replied
patsy
but
we
are
following
a
regular
road
not
a
very
good
one
nor
much
traveled
but
a
road
nevertheless
and
any
road
is
public
property
and
open
for
the
use
of
travelers
perhaps
we
shall
pass
by
their
ranch
house
suggested
beth
if
we
do
uncle
john
answered
i
have
wampus
put
on
full
speed
even
their
wild
ponies
ca
follow
us
then
and
if
they
try
shooting
up
the
tires
again
they
are
quite
likely
to
miss
as
we
spin
by
is
there
any
other
road
the
major
asked
wampus
shook
his
head
i
have
never
come
jus
this
same
route
before
he
admitted
but
i
make
good
friend
in
prescott
who
know
all
arizona
blindfold
him
say
this
is
nice
easy
road
and
we
can
not
get
lost
for
a
good
reason
the
reason
there
is
no
other
road
at
all
only
this
one
did
your
friend
say
anything
about
hades
ranch
continued
the
questioner
he
say
remittance
man
make
much
mischief
if
he
can
but
he
one
foreign
coward
drunk
most
time
an
when
sober
weak
like
my
tea
he
say
do
let
remittance
man
make
bluff
no
matter
how
many
come
if
you
hit
one
they
all
run
murmured
uncle
john
i
not
so
sure
of
that
wampus
there
seems
to
be
a
good
many
of
those
insolent
rascals
and
i
hope
we
shall
not
meet
them
again
they
may
give
us
trouble
yet
never
be
afraid
advised
the
chauffeur
i
am
wampus
an
i
am
here
admitting
that
evident
truth
our
tourists
were
not
greatly
reassured
wampus
could
not
tell
where
the
road
might
lead
them
for
he
did
not
know
save
that
it
led
by
devious
winds
to
parker
on
the
border
between
arizona
and
california
but
what
lay
between
them
and
that
destination
was
a
sealed
book
to
them
all
the
car
was
heavy
and
the
road
soft
so
in
spite
of
their
powerful
engines
the
car
was
not
making
more
than
fifteen
miles
an
hour
a
short
ride
brought
them
to
a
ridge
from
the
top
of
which
they
saw
a
huddle
of
buildings
not
far
distant
with
a
paddock
containing
a
number
of
ponies
and
cattle
the
buildings
were
not
palatial
being
composed
mostly
of
adobe
and
slab
wood
but
the
central
one
probably
the
dwelling
or
ranch
house
was
a
low
rambling
pile
covering
considerable
ground
the
road
led
directly
toward
this
group
of
buildings
which
our
travelers
at
once
guessed
to
be
hades
ranch
wampus
slowed
down
and
cast
a
sharp
glance
around
but
the
land
on
either
side
of
the
trail
was
thick
with
cactus
and
sagebrush
and
to
leave
the
beaten
path
meant
a
puncture
almost
instantly
there
was
but
one
thing
to
be
done
pretty
good
road
here
said
wampus
hold
tight
an
do
get
scare
we
make
a
race
of
it
go
ahead
returned
uncle
john
grimly
if
any
of
those
scoundrels
get
in
your
way
run
them
down
i
never
like
to
hurt
peoples
but
if
that
is
your
command
sir
i
will
obey
said
wampus
setting
his
jaws
tightly
together
the
car
gathered
speed
and
shot
over
the
road
at
the
rate
of
twenty
miles
an
hour
then
then
thirty
and
finally
forty
the
girls
sat
straight
and
looked
eagerly
ahead
forms
were
darting
here
and
there
among
the
buildings
of
the
ranch
quickly
congregating
in
groups
on
either
side
of
the
roadway
a
red
flag
fluttered
in
the
center
of
the
road
some
four
feet
from
the
ground
look
out
shouted
uncle
john
stop
wampus
stop
her
i
say
wampus
saw
why
and
applied
his
brakes
the
big
car
trembled
slowed
down
and
came
to
a
stop
less
than
a
foot
away
from
three
ugly
bars
of
barbed
wire
which
had
been
placed
across
the
road
they
were
now
just
beside
the
buildings
and
a
triumphant
shout
greeted
them
from
their
captors
the
remittance
men
chapter
xii
captured
welcome
to
hades
cried
a
stout
little
man
in
a
red
blouse
sticking
his
leering
countenance
through
the
door
of
the
limousine
shut
up
stubby
commanded
a
hoarse
voice
from
the
group
you
any
manners
you
have
been
introduced
yet
i
engaged
the
dark
eyed
one
for
the
first
dance
persisted
stubby
as
a
dozen
hands
dragged
him
away
from
the
door
the
major
sprang
out
and
confronted
the
band
what
are
we
to
understand
by
this
outrage
he
demanded
fiercely
it
means
you
are
all
invited
to
a
party
and
we
wo
accept
any
regrets
replied
a
laughing
voice
patsy
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
and
looked
at
the
speaker
it
was
algernon
tobey
he
had
two
strips
of
sticking
plaster
over
his
nose
one
of
his
eyes
was
swollen
shut
and
the
other
was
almost
closed
yet
he
spoke
in
a
voice
more
cheerful
than
it
was
when
they
first
met
him
do
be
afraid
he
added
no
one
has
the
slightest
intention
of
injuring
any
of
you
in
any
way
i
assure
you
we
have
not
the
same
intention
in
regard
to
you
sir
replied
major
doyle
fuming
with
rage
for
his
irish
was
up
as
he
afterward
admitted
unless
you
at
once
remove
that
barricade
and
allow
us
to
proceed
we
will
not
be
responsible
for
what
happens
you
are
warned
sir
uncle
john
by
this
time
standing
beside
the
major
upon
the
ground
had
been
quietly
sizing
up
the
situation
as
he
would
have
expressed
it
he
found
they
had
been
captured
by
a
party
of
fourteen
men
most
of
whom
were
young
although
three
or
four
including
tobey
were
of
middle
age
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
with
its
disorderly
surroundings
and
ill
kept
buildings
indicated
that
hades
ranch
was
bachelor
quarters
exclusively
half
a
dozen
mexicans
and
one
or
two
chinamen
were
in
the
background
curious
onlookers
merrick
noted
the
fact
that
the
remittance
men
were
an
unkempt
dissipated
looking
crew
but
that
their
faces
betokened
reckless
good
humor
rather
than
desperate
evil
there
was
no
doubt
but
most
of
them
were
considering
this
episode
in
the
light
of
a
joke
and
were
determined
to
enjoy
the
experience
at
the
expense
of
their
enforced
guests
uncle
john
had
lived
many
years
in
the
west
and
knew
something
of
these
peculiar
english
exiles
therefore
he
was
neither
frightened
nor
unduly
angry
but
rather
annoyed
by
the
provoking
audacity
of
the
fellows
he
had
three
young
girls
to
protect
and
knew
these
men
could
not
be
fit
acquaintances
for
them
but
he
adopted
a
tone
different
from
the
major
and
addressed
himself
to
tobey
as
the
apparent
leader
of
the
band
sir
he
said
calmly
but
with
pointed
emphasis
i
believe
you
were
born
a
gentleman
as
were
your
comrades
here
you
are
right
answered
tobey
and
each
and
every
one
you
see
before
you
has
fallen
from
his
former
high
estate
through
no
fault
of
his
own
this
may
have
been
a
sarcasm
for
the
others
laughed
in
boisterous
approval
in
some
respects
we
are
still
gentlemen
tobey
went
on
but
in
others
we
are
not
to
be
trusted
be
reasonable
sir
i
have
the
faintest
idea
who
you
are
or
what
your
name
is
and
consider
calmly
our
proposition
here
we
are
a
number
of
young
fellows
who
have
seen
better
and
happier
days
living
alone
in
the
midst
of
an
alkali
desert
most
of
us
have
seen
a
female
for
months
nor
a
lady
for
years
why
last
fall
stubby
there
rode
eighty
miles
to
buxton
just
to
stand
on
a
corner
and
see
a
lot
of
greasy
mexican
women
go
by
we
tire
of
exclusive
male
society
you
see
we
get
to
bore
one
another
terribly
so
here
like
a
visitation
from
heaven
three
attractive
young
ladies
descend
upon
us
traveling
through
our
domain
and
having
discovered
their
presence
we
instantly
decided
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
and
invite
them
to
an
impromptu
ball
there
no
use
refusing
us
for
we
insist
on
carrying
out
our
plan
if
you
men
perhaps
the
fathers
of
the
young
ladies
behave
reasonably
we
will
entertain
you
royally
and
send
you
on
your
way
rejoicing
wo
we
boys
they
shouted
approval
but
if
you
oppose
us
and
act
ugly
about
this
fête
gentlemen
we
shall
be
obliged
to
put
a
few
bullets
into
you
and
decide
afterward
what
disposition
to
make
of
the
girls
about
the
best
stunt
we
do
is
shooting
we
ca
work
we
too
poor
to
gamble
much
but
we
hunt
a
good
bit
and
we
can
shoot
straight
i
assure
you
we
would
mind
losing
and
taking
a
few
lives
if
a
scrimmage
is
necessary
eh
boys
that
right
algy
said
one
answering
for
the
others
we
have
that
dance
if
we
die
for
it
man
jack
of
us
myrtle
was
trembling
in
her
corner
of
the
limousine
beth
sat
still
with
a
curl
on
her
lips
but
patsy
was
much
interested
in
the
proceedings
and
had
listened
attentively
to
the
above
conversation
now
the
girl
suddenly
swung
open
the
door
and
sprang
out
beside
her
father
facing
the
group
of
cowboys
i
am
patricia
doyle
she
said
in
a
clear
voice
and
these
gentlemen
indicating
the
major
and
merrick
are
my
father
and
my
uncle
you
understand
perfectly
why
they
object
to
the
arrangement
you
suggest
as
any
one
of
you
would
object
had
you
a
daughter
in
a
like
position
but
you
are
arbitrary
and
not
inclined
to
respect
womanhood
therefore
but
one
course
is
open
to
us
to
submit
under
protest
to
the
unwelcome
attentions
you
desire
to
thrust
upon
us
they
listened
silently
to
this
frank
speech
and
some
of
their
faces
wore
crestfallen
expressions
by
the
time
she
had
finished
indeed
one
of
the
older
men
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
away
disappearing
among
the
buildings
after
a
brief
hesitation
a
delicate
young
fellow
almost
a
boy
followed
this
man
his
face
flaming
red
with
shame
but
the
others
stood
their
ground
very
good
miss
doyle
remarked
tobey
with
forced
cheerfulness
you
are
quite
sensible
to
submit
to
the
inevitable
bring
out
your
friends
and
introduce
them
and
then
we
all
go
in
to
luncheon
and
prepare
for
the
dance
i
wo
submit
to
this
cried
the
major
stamping
his
foot
angrily
yes
you
will
said
uncle
john
with
a
motion
preventing
his
irate
from
drawing
a
revolver
patsy
is
quite
right
and
we
will
submit
with
as
much
dignity
as
we
can
muster
being
overpowered
by
numbers
he
beckoned
to
beth
who
stepped
out
of
the
car
and
assisted
myrtle
to
follow
her
a
little
cheer
of
bravado
had
arisen
from
the
group
inspired
by
their
apparent
victory
but
when
myrtle
crutches
appeared
and
they
saw
the
fair
innocent
face
of
the
young
girl
who
rested
upon
them
the
shout
died
away
in
a
hush
of
surprise
this
is
my
cousin
elizabeth
de
graf
announced
patsy
with
cold
deliberation
determined
that
the
proprieties
should
be
observed
in
all
intercourse
with
these
people
and
i
present
our
friend
myrtle
dean
under
ordinary
circumstances
i
believe
myrtle
would
be
excused
from
dancing
but
i
suppose
no
brute
in
the
form
of
a
man
would
have
consideration
for
her
infirmity
this
time
even
tobey
flushed
you
a
sharp
tongue
miss
doyle
and
it
liable
to
lead
you
into
trouble
he
retorted
losing
for
the
moment
his
suave
demeanor
we
may
be
brutes
and
i
imagine
we
are
but
we
not
dangerous
unless
provoked
it
was
savagely
said
and
uncle
john
took
warning
and
motioned
patsy
to
be
silent
lead
the
way
sir
he
said
our
chauffeur
will
of
course
remain
with
the
car
wampus
had
kept
his
seat
motionless
and
silent
he
only
nodded
in
answer
to
merrick
instructions
and
was
entirely
disregarded
by
the
remittance
men
the
man
called
stubby
who
had
a
round
face
stepped
eagerly
to
myrtle
side
and
exclaimed
let
me
assist
you
please
no
she
said
shaking
her
head
with
a
wan
smile
i
am
quite
able
to
walk
alone
he
followed
her
though
full
of
interest
and
with
an
air
of
deep
respect
that
belied
his
former
actions
tobey
content
with
his
present
success
walked
beside
merrick
and
led
the
procession
toward
the
ranch
house
the
major
followed
his
tall
form
upright
his
manner
bellicose
and
resentful
with
beth
and
patsy
on
either
side
of
him
the
remittance
men
followed
in
a
straggling
crowd
laughing
and
boisterously
talking
among
themselves
just
as
they
reached
the
house
a
horseman
came
clattering
down
the
road
and
all
paused
involuntarily
to
mark
the
new
arrival
the
rider
was
a
handsome
slim
young
fellow
dressed
as
were
the
other
cowboys
present
and
he
came
on
at
a
breakneck
speed
that
seemed
only
warranted
by
an
errand
of
life
and
death
in
front
of
him
tied
to
the
saddle
appeared
a
huge
bundle
and
as
the
horse
dashed
up
to
the
group
standing
by
the
ranch
house
the
rider
gracefully
threw
himself
off
and
removed
his
hat
with
a
sweeping
gesture
as
he
observed
the
young
ladies
i
got
him
algy
he
cried
merrily
asked
tobey
himself
he
pointed
to
the
bundle
which
heaved
and
wriggled
to
show
it
was
alive
he
refused
to
come
willingly
of
course
so
i
brought
him
anyhow
never
yet
was
there
a
fiddler
willing
to
be
accommodating
good
for
you
tim
shouted
a
dozen
voices
and
stubby
added
in
his
earnest
way
was
never
more
needed
in
his
life
tobey
was
busy
unwinding
a
long
lariat
that
bent
the
captive
nearly
double
and
secured
him
firmly
to
the
panting
horse
when
the
bonds
were
removed
would
have
tumbled
prone
to
the
ground
had
not
willing
hands
caught
him
and
supported
him
upon
his
feet
our
friends
then
observed
that
he
was
an
aged
man
with
a
face
thickly
furrowed
with
wrinkles
he
had
but
one
eye
small
and
gray
and
very
shrewd
in
expression
which
he
turned
contemptuously
upon
the
crowd
surrounding
him
numb
and
trembling
from
his
cramped
position
upon
the
horse
and
the
terrible
jouncing
he
had
endured
the
fiddler
could
scarcely
stand
at
first
and
shook
as
with
a
palsy
but
he
made
a
brave
effort
to
control
his
weakness
and
turned
smilingly
at
the
murmur
of
pity
and
indignation
that
came
from
the
lips
of
the
girls
where
the
fiddle
demanded
tobey
and
tim
unhooked
a
calico
bag
from
the
saddlebow
and
held
it
out
a
laugh
greeted
the
gesture
said
he
be
hanged
if
he
come
announced
tim
with
a
grim
appreciation
of
the
humorous
side
of
the
situation
so
i
hung
him
and
brought
him
along
and
his
fiddle
to
boot
but
do
boot
it
until
after
the
dance
what
do
you
mean
sir
by
this
rebellious
attitude
questioned
tobey
sticking
his
damaged
face
close
to
that
of
the
fiddler
blinked
with
his
one
eye
but
refused
to
answer
i
a
good
mind
to
skin
you
alive
continued
the
leader
in
a
savage
tone
you
either
obey
my
orders
or
i
throw
you
into
the
snake
pit
let
him
alone
algy
said
tim
carelessly
the
old
scoundrel
has
been
tortured
enough
already
but
i
see
we
have
partners
for
the
dance
looking
critically
at
the
girls
and
i
claim
first
choice
because
i
brought
the
fiddler
at
this
a
roar
of
protest
arose
and
tobey
turned
and
said
sullenly
come
in
all
of
you
we
settle
the
order
of
dancing
later
on
the
interior
of
the
ranch
house
was
certainly
picturesque
a
great
living
room
ran
all
across
the
front
with
an
immense
fireplace
built
of
irregular
adobe
bricks
the
floor
was
strewn
with
skins
of
animals
mostly
coyotes
a
few
deer
and
one
or
two
mountain
lions
and
the
walls
were
thickly
hung
with
weapons
and
trophies
of
the
chase
a
big
table
in
one
corner
was
loaded
with
bottles
and
glasses
indicating
the
intemperate
habits
of
the
inmates
while
on
the
chimney
shelf
were
rows
of
pipes
and
jars
of
tobacco
an
odor
similar
to
that
of
a
barroom
hung
over
the
place
which
the
air
from
the
open
windows
seemed
unable
to
dissipate
there
were
plenty
of
benches
and
chairs
with
a
long
mess
table
occupying
the
center
of
the
room
in
a
corner
was
an
old
square
piano
which
a
mexican
was
trying
to
dust
as
the
party
entered
welcome
to
hades
exclaimed
tobey
with
an
absurd
gesture
be
good
enough
to
make
yourselves
at
home
and
i
see
if
those
devils
of
chinamen
are
getting
luncheon
ready
silently
the
prisoners
sat
down
the
crowd
poured
in
after
them
and
disposed
themselves
in
various
attitudes
about
the
big
room
all
staring
with
more
or
less
boldness
at
the
three
girls
the
fiddler
was
pushed
in
with
the
others
and
given
a
seat
while
two
or
three
of
the
imitation
cowboys
kept
guard
over
him
to
prevent
any
possible
escape
so
far
the
old
man
had
not
addressed
a
word
to
anyone
with
the
absence
of
the
leader
the
feeling
of
restraint
seemed
to
relax
the
cowboys
began
whispering
among
themselves
and
chuckling
with
glee
as
if
they
were
enjoying
some
huge
joke
stubby
had
placed
himself
near
the
three
young
ladies
whom
he
eyed
with
adoring
glances
and
somehow
none
of
the
prisoners
regarded
this
childish
young
fellow
in
exactly
the
same
light
as
they
did
his
comrades
tim
his
attitude
full
of
grace
as
he
lounged
against
a
settle
was
also
near
the
group
he
seemed
a
bit
thoughtful
since
his
dramatic
arrival
and
had
little
to
say
to
anyone
merrick
engaged
stubby
in
conversation
does
tobey
own
this
place
he
asked
by
proxy
yes
was
the
reply
it
is
in
his
name
you
know
although
that
does
matter
for
he
could
sell
his
desert
ranch
if
he
had
a
title
to
it
i
suppose
that
is
what
his
folks
were
afraid
of
algy
is
the
fourth
son
of
old
lord
featherbone
and
got
into
a
disgraceful
mess
in
london
some
years
ago
so
featherbone
shipped
him
over
here
in
charge
of
a
family
solicitor
who
hunted
out
this
sequestered
spot
bought
a
couple
of
thousand
acres
and
built
this
hut
then
he
went
home
and
left
algy
here
to
keep
up
the
place
on
a
paltry
ten
pounds
fifty
dollars
a
month
can
he
manage
to
do
that
asked
uncle
john
why
he
has
to
you
see
he
got
together
a
few
cattle
mostly
stolen
i
imagine
but
he
does
try
to
work
the
land
moreover
established
this
community
composed
of
his
suffering
fellow
exiles
the
secret
of
which
lies
in
the
fact
that
we
work
the
cooperative
plan
and
all
chip
in
our
remittances
to
boil
the
common
pot
we
can
keep
more
servants
and
buy
more
food
and
drink
that
way
than
if
each
one
of
us
lived
separately
up
in
oregon
said
merrick
i
known
of
some
very
successful
and
prosperous
ranchmen
among
the
remittance
men
oh
we
all
kinds
i
suppose
good
and
bad
admitted
stubby
this
crew
mostly
bad
and
they
moderately
proud
of
it
it
a
devil
of
a
life
sir
and
hades
ranch
is
well
named
i
only
been
here
a
month
had
a
little
property
up
north
but
the
sheriff
took
it
for
debt
and
that
forced
me
to
algy
whom
i
detest
i
think
i
move
on
before
long
but
you
see
i
limited
ca
leave
arizona
or
i
get
my
remittance
cut
off
why
were
you
sent
here
into
exile
asked
myrtle
artlessly
he
turned
red
and
refused
to
meet
her
eyes
went
wrong
miss
he
said
and
my
folks
would
stand
for
it
we
all
in
the
same
boat
sweeping
his
arm
around
doing
punishment
for
our
misdeeds
do
none
of
you
ever
reform
inquired
patsy
what
the
use
we
so
far
away
from
home
no
one
there
would
ever
believe
in
our
reformation
once
we
become
outcasts
that
the
end
of
our
careers
we
buried
in
these
western
wilds
and
allowed
just
enough
to
keep
alive
i
would
think
said
uncle
john
musingly
that
the
manly
way
would
be
to
cut
yourself
off
entirely
from
your
people
at
home
and
go
to
some
city
in
the
united
states
where
honesty
and
industry
would
win
a
new
name
for
you
then
you
could
be
respected
and
happy
and
become
of
use
to
the
world
stubby
laughed
that
has
been
tried
he
replied
but
few
ever
made
a
success
of
it
we
generally
the
kind
that
prefers
idleness
to
work
my
family
is
wealthy
and
i
do
mind
taking
from
them
what
little
they
give
me
willingly
and
all
that
i
can
screw
out
of
them
besides
i
in
for
life
as
the
saying
is
and
i
no
especial
ambition
except
to
drink
myself
to
death
as
soon
as
possible
patsy
shuddered
it
seemed
a
horrible
thing
to
be
so
utterly
hopeless
could
this
young
fellow
have
really
merited
his
fate
chapter
xiii
the
fiddler
tim
had
listened
carelessly
to
the
conversation
until
now
when
he
said
listlessly
do
think
us
all
criminals
for
we
not
in
my
own
case
i
did
nothing
to
deserve
exile
except
that
i
annoyed
my
elder
brother
by
becoming
more
popular
with
our
social
set
than
he
was
he
had
all
the
property
and
i
was
penniless
so
he
got
rid
of
me
by
threatening
to
cut
off
my
allowance
unless
i
went
to
america
and
stayed
there
and
you
accepted
such
a
condition
cried
patsy
scornfully
why
were
you
not
independent
enough
to
earn
your
own
living
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
yet
seemed
amused
i
simply
could
said
he
i
was
not
educated
to
work
you
know
and
to
do
so
at
home
would
be
to
disgrace
my
noble
family
i
too
much
respect
for
my
lineage
to
labor
with
my
hands
or
head
but
here
in
america
no
one
would
know
you
suggested
beth
i
would
only
humiliate
myself
by
undertaking
such
a
task
and
why
should
i
do
so
while
i
am
in
america
my
affectionate
brother
the
head
of
the
family
supports
me
as
is
his
duty
your
philosophy
is
pretty
enough
but
it
is
not
practical
the
whole
fault
lies
in
our
system
of
inheritance
the
elder
male
of
a
family
getting
all
the
estate
and
the
younger
ones
nothing
at
all
here
in
this
crude
and
plebeian
country
i
believe
it
is
the
custom
to
provide
for
all
one
children
and
a
father
is
at
liberty
to
do
so
because
his
estate
is
not
entailed
and
he
earns
it
himself
and
can
do
what
he
likes
with
it
added
uncle
john
impatiently
your
system
of
inheritance
and
entail
may
be
somewhat
to
blame
but
your
worst
fault
is
in
rearing
a
class
of
mollycoddles
and
social
drones
who
are
never
of
benefit
to
themselves
or
the
world
at
large
you
sir
i
consider
something
less
than
a
man
i
agree
with
you
replied
tim
readily
i
only
good
to
cumber
the
earth
and
if
i
get
little
pleasure
out
of
life
i
must
admit
that
all
i
entitled
to
and
you
ca
break
your
bonds
and
escape
asked
patsy
i
do
care
to
people
who
are
ambitious
to
do
things
merely
bore
me
i
do
admire
them
or
care
to
imitate
them
from
that
moment
they
took
no
further
interest
in
the
handsome
outcast
his
world
was
not
their
world
and
now
tobey
came
in
driving
before
him
a
lot
of
mexicans
bearing
trays
of
food
the
long
table
was
laid
in
a
moment
for
everything
was
dumped
upon
it
without
any
attempt
at
order
each
of
the
cowboys
seized
a
plate
from
a
pile
at
one
end
and
helped
himself
to
whatever
he
wanted
two
or
three
of
the
men
however
were
courteous
enough
to
attend
to
their
unwilling
guests
and
see
they
were
served
as
well
as
conditions
would
permit
the
food
was
plentiful
and
of
good
quality
but
although
none
of
uncle
john
party
was
squeamish
or
a
stickler
for
form
all
more
or
less
revolted
from
the
utter
disregard
of
all
the
proprieties
i
sorry
we
have
no
wine
but
there
plenty
of
whiskey
if
you
like
it
remarked
tobey
the
girls
were
silent
and
ate
little
although
they
could
not
help
being
interested
in
observing
the
bohemianism
of
these
gently
reared
but
decadent
sons
of
respectable
english
families
as
soon
as
they
could
they
left
the
table
and
tobey
observing
their
uneasiness
in
spite
of
his
damaged
and
nearly
useless
optics
decided
to
send
them
to
another
room
where
they
could
pass
the
afternoon
without
further
annoyance
stubby
escorted
the
party
and
ushered
them
into
a
good
sized
room
which
he
said
was
algy
study
although
no
one
ever
studied
there
algy
afraid
you
balk
at
the
dance
so
he
wants
to
please
you
however
he
can
remarked
the
round
faced
youth
you
wo
mind
being
left
alone
will
you
we
prefer
it
sir
answered
the
major
stiffly
you
see
we
going
to
have
a
rare
lark
this
afternoon
continued
stubby
confidentially
usually
it
pretty
dull
here
and
all
we
can
do
is
ride
and
hunt
play
cards
and
quarrel
but
your
coming
has
created
no
end
of
excitement
and
this
dance
will
be
our
day
for
a
long
time
to
come
the
deuce
of
if
is
however
that
there
are
only
two
girls
to
dance
with
thirteen
men
we
limit
our
community
to
fifteen
you
know
but
little
ford
and
old
rutledge
have
backed
down
and
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
this
enterprise
i
do
know
why
he
continued
thoughtfully
perhaps
they
still
have
some
gentlemanly
instincts
suggested
patsy
that
must
be
it
he
replied
in
a
relieved
tone
well
anyhow
to
avoid
quarrels
and
bloodshed
we
agreed
to
throw
dice
for
the
dances
every
one
is
to
have
an
equal
chance
you
see
and
when
you
young
ladies
open
the
dance
the
entire
programme
will
be
arranged
for
you
are
we
to
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
of
partners
inquired
beth
curiously
none
whatever
there
would
surely
be
a
row
in
that
case
and
we
intend
to
have
everything
pass
off
pleasantly
if
we
have
to
kill
a
few
to
keep
the
peace
with
this
stubby
bowed
low
and
retreated
toward
the
door
which
suddenly
opened
to
admit
old
the
fiddler
who
was
thrust
in
so
violently
that
his
body
collided
with
that
of
stubby
and
nearly
knocked
him
over
that
all
right
laughed
the
remittance
man
recovering
from
the
shock
you
must
escape
you
know
for
we
depend
on
you
for
the
music
he
closed
the
door
as
he
went
out
and
they
all
heard
a
bolt
shoot
into
place
yet
the
broad
window
scarcely
six
feet
from
the
ground
stood
wide
open
to
admit
the
air
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
motionless
for
a
moment
then
he
raised
his
wrinkled
face
and
clinched
his
fists
shaking
them
in
the
direction
of
the
me

muttered

to

mockery
they
were
the
first
words
he
had
spoken
since
his
arrival
and
they
seemed
to
hold
all
his
pentup
indignation
the
girls
pitied
the
old
man
and
recognizing
in
him
a
fellow
prisoner
sought
to
comfort
him
if
the
dance
depends
upon
us
there
will
be
no
dance
said
patsy
firmly
i

uncle
john
in

only
to
gain

the

said
uncle

but

heads
i

and
if

we

you

in
safety
now
my
dears
what
is
it
oh
we
only
begun
to
think
yet
said
patsy
and
walked
to
the
window
all
but
myrtle
and
followed
her
below
the
window
was
a
jungle
of
cactus
with
hundreds
of
spines
as
slender
and
sharp
as
stilettos
sticking
in
every
direction
this
room
is
burglar
proof
muttered
uncle
john
with
marked
disappointment
it
also
makes
an
excellent
prison
added
patsy
but
i
suspected
something
of
this
sort
when
i
saw
they
had
left
the
window
open
we
ca
figure
on
getting
out
that
way
you
see
id
vould
be
suiciding
said
mournfully
shaking
his
head
if
dese
fiends
were
as
goot
as
dey
are
clefer
dey
vould
be
angels
no
argument
seems
to
prevail
with
them
remarked
beth
they
are
lawless
and
merciless
and
in
this
country
believe
they
may
do
as
they
please
they
as
bad
as
the
bandits
of
taormina
observed
patsy
smiling
at
the
recollection
of
an
adventure
they
had
abroad
but
we
must
find
some
way
to
evade
them
had
gone
over
to
myrtle
corner
and
stood
staring
at
her
with
his
one
shrewd
eye
uncle
john
looked
thoughtfully
out
of
the
window
and
saw
wampus
busy
in
the
road
before
the
house
he
had
his
coat
off
and
was
cutting
the
bars
of
barbed
wire
and
rolling
them
out
of
the
way
while
mumbles
who
had
been
left
with
him
ran
here
and
there
at
his
heels
as
if
desiring
to
assist
him
from
the
big
hall
or
living
room
at
the
right
came
a
dull
roar
of
voices
subdued
shouts
and
laughter
mingled
with
the
clinking
of
glasses
all
the
remittance
men
were
gathered
there
deep
in
the
game
of
dice
which
was
to
determine
the
order
in
which
they
were
to
dance
with
beth
and
patsy
the
servants
were
out
of
sight
wampus
had
the
field
to
himself
come
here
said
uncle
john
to
the
girls
and
when
they
stood
beside
him
pointed
to
the
car
wampus
is
making
ready
for
the
escape
he
continued
he
has
cleared
the
road
and
the
way
is
now
open
if
we
can
manage
to
get
to
the
machine
has
your
plan
matured
yet
patsy
shook
her
head
not
yet
uncle
she
replied
could
wampus
throw
us
a
rope
inquired
the
major
he
could
said
uncle
john
but
we
would
be
unable
to
use
it
those
terrible
cactus
spines
are
near
enough
to
spear
anyone
who
dared
try
to
slide
down
a
rope
think
of
something
else
they
all
tried
to
do
that
but
no
practical
idea
seemed
forthcoming
oh
no
was
saying
to
myrtle
dey
are
nod
afraid
to

asked
beth
overhearing
this
speech
i
belief
id
said
wagging
his
ancient
head
dey
like
to
be
ready
to
draw
quick
like
if
anybody
shteps
on
anybody
toes
yes
of
course
what
a
horrible
idea
exclaimed
patsy
they
quite
liable
to
dance
and
murder
in
the
same
breath
the
major
observed
gloomily
i
do
like
it
said
beth
it
something
awful
just
to
think
of
have
they
any
gallantry
no
answered
patsy
but
i
would
dance
with
a
lot
of
half
drunken
men
wearing
revolvers
if
they
burned
me
at
the
stake
for
refusing
ah
shtick
to

expressionment
cried
eagerly
shtick
to

say
you

we
win
de
schweepstakes
patsy
looked
at
him
critically
in
the
instant
catching
a
part
of
his
idea
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
explained
while
they
all
listened
carefully
absorbed
in
following
in
thought
his
unique
suggestions
let
do
it
exclaimed
beth
i
sure
the
plan
will
succeed
it
leaving
a
good
deal
to
chance
objected
uncle
john
with
a
touch
of
nervousness
there
is
an
element
of
chance
in
everything
declared
patsy
but
i
sure
we
shall
escape
uncle
why
it
a
regular
coup
we
take
them
by
surprise
you
know
explained
the
major
who
heartily
favored
the
idea
they
talked
it
over
for
a
time
perfecting
the
details
and
then
became
as
calm
and
composed
as
a
group
of
prisoners
might
uncle
john
waved
his
handkerchief
to
attract
the
attention
of
wampus
who
stole
softly
around
the
corner
of
the
house
and
approached
the
window
taking
care
to
keep
at
a
respectful
distance
from
the
dangerous
cactus
is
everything
ready
inquired
uncle
john
in
a
subdued
voice
to
be
sure
all
is
ready
why
not
i
am
wampus
was
the
reply
in
cautious
tones
go
back
to
the
machine
and
guard
it
carefully
wampus
commanded
merrick
we
expect
to
escape
soon
after
dark
so
have
the
headlights
going
for
we
shall
make
a
rush
for
it
and
there
must
be
a
delay
all
right
said
the
chauffeur
you
may
depend
on
me
i
am
wampus
an
not
of
a
hundred
coward
like
these
is
not
mister
algy
his
eye
mos
beautiful
blacked
it
is
agreed
uncle
john
go
back
to
the
car
now
and
wait
for
us
do
get
impatient
we
do
know
just
when
we
will
join
you
but
it
will
be
as
soon
as
we
can
manage
it
what
is
mumbles
doing
mumble
he
learn
to
be
good
automobilist
jus
now
he
sit
on
seat
watch
wheel
to
see
nobody
touch
if
anybody
touch
mumble
he
eat
him
up
they
all
laughed
at
this
whimsical
notion
and
it
served
to
relieve
the
strain
of
waiting
wampus
grinning
at
the
success
of
his
joke
went
back
to
the
limousine
to
inspect
it
carefully
and
adjust
it
in
every
part
until
it
was
in
perfect
order
now
that
a
definite
plan
of
action
had
been
decided
upon
their
spirits
rose
considerably
and
they
passed
the
afternoon
in
eager
anticipation
of
the
crisis
rather
earlier
than
expected
stubby
and
tim
came
to
say
they
had
been
appointed
a
committee
to
escort
their
guests
to
the
banquet
hall
where
dinner
would
at
once
be
served
we
shall
have
to
clear
away
for
the
dance
added
stubby
so
we
want
to
get
the
feast
over
with
as
quickly
as
possible
i
hope
you
are
all
hungry
for
algy
has
spread
himself
on
this
dinner
and
we
are
to
have
every
delicacy
the
ranch
affords
regardless
of
expense
we
can
economize
afterward
to
make
up
for
it
elaborate
preparations
were
not
greatly
in
evidence
however
the
mexican
servants
had
washed
themselves
and
the
floor
of
the
big
room
had
been
swept
and
cleared
of
some
of
its
rubbish
but
that
was
all
the
remittance
men
were
in
their
usual
rough
costumes
and
the
air
was
redolent
with
the
fumes
of
liquor
chapter
xiv
the
escape
as
the
prisoners
quietly
took
their
places
at
the
table
tobey
who
had
been
drinking
hard
decided
to
make
a
speech
his
face
was
badly
swollen
and
he
could
only
see
through
a
slit
in
one
eye
so
severe
had
been
the
beating
administered
by
wampus
earlier
in
the
day
but
the
fellow
had
grit
in
spite
of
his
other
unmanly
qualities
and
his
imperturbable
good
humor
had
scarcely
been
disturbed
by
the
punishment
the
canadian
had
inflicted
upon
him
ladies
said
he
and
gentlemen
which
of
course
includes
our
respected
male
guests
i
am
happy
to
inform
you
that
the
programme
for
the
first
annual
hades
ranch
ball
has
finally
been
arranged
and
the
dances
apportioned
in
a
fair
and
impartial
manner
the
grand
march
will
take
place
promptly
at
seven
led
by
miss
doyle
and
knuckles
who
has
won
the
privilege
by
throwing
four
sixes
i
am
to
follow
with
miss
de
graf
and
the
rest
will
troop
on
behind
with
the
privilege
of
looking
at
the
ladies
if
anyone
dares
to
create
disorder
his
dances
with
the
young
ladies
will
be
forfeited
will
play
the
latest
dance
music
on
his
fiddle
and
if
it
is
spirited
and
we
shoot
his
toes
off
we
insist
upon
plenty
of
and
waltzes
and
will
wind
up
with
a
in
the
gray
light
of
dawn
this
being
fully
understood
i
beg
you
my
good
friends
to
fall
to
and
eat
and
be
merry
but
do
linger
unduly
over
the
dainties
for
we
are
all
anxious
like
good
soldiers
to
get
into
action
the
remittance
men
applauded
this
oratory
and
incidentally
attacked
the
eatables
with
evident
determination
to
obey
their
injunction
we
can
eat
any
time
remarked
stubby
with
his
mouth
full
but
his
satanic
majesty
only
knows
when
hades
ranch
will
see
another
dance
with
real
ladies
for
partners
the
chinese
cooks
and
the
mexican
servants
had
a
lively
time
during
this
meal
for
the
demands
made
upon
them
were
incessant
uncle
john
whose
even
disposition
was
seldom
ruffled
ate
with
a
good
appetite
while
even
the
major
glum
and
scowling
did
not
disdain
the
numerous
dishes
as
for
he
took
full
advantage
of
the
occasion
and
was
the
last
one
to
leave
the
table
our
girls
however
were
too
excited
to
eat
much
and
little
myrtle
especially
was
pallid
and
uneasy
and
had
a
startled
look
in
her
eyes
whenever
anyone
made
a
sudden
motion
as
soon
as
the
repast
was
concluded
the
servants
cleared
the
long
table
in
a
twinkling
and
pushed
it
back
against
the
wall
at
one
end
of
the
long
room
a
chair
was
placed
for
on
top
of
this
expansive
board
which
thus
became
a
stage
from
whence
he
could
overlook
the
room
and
the
dancers
and
then
two
of
the
remittance
men
tossed
the
old
fiddler
to
his
elevated
place
and
commanded
him
to
make
ready
said
nothing
and
offered
no
resistance
he
sat
plaintively
sawing
upon
his
ancient
but
violin
while
the
floor
was
brushed
the
chairs
and
benches
pushed
against
the
wall
and
the
room
prepared
for
action
behind
the
violinist
was
a
low
broad
window
facing
a
grass
plot
that
was
free
from
the
terrifying
cactus
and
the
old
man
noted
with
satisfaction
that
it
stood
wide
open
uncle
john
party
had
pressed
close
to
the
table
and
stood
watching
the
proceedings
ready
now
called
tobey
the
grand
march
is
about
to
begin
take
your
partners
boys
look
sharp
there
and
give
us
a
martial
tune
that
will
lift
our
feet
meekly
set
the
violin
underneath
his
chin
and
raised
the
bow
as
if
in
readiness
knuckles
a
brawny
fellow
with
a
florid
face
and
a
peculiar
squint
approached
patsy
and
bowed
you
to
lead
with
me
miss
he
said
are
you
ready
not
quite
she
returned
with
dignified
composure
for
i
perceive
you
are
not
quite
ready
yourself
eh
why
not
he
inquired
surprised
you
are
still
wearing
your
firearms
she
replied
i
can
not
and
will
not
dance
with
a
man
who
carries
a
revolver
that
nothing
he
retorted
we
always
do
always
of
course
and
if
i
shed
my
gun
what
to
prevent
some
one
else
getting
the
drop
on
me
that
it
said
patsy
firmly
the
weapons
must
all
be
surrendered
before
we
begin
we
positively
refuse
to
dance
if
rioting
and
shooting
are
likely
to
occur
a
murmur
of
protest
arose
at
this
speech
for
all
the
remittance
men
had
gathered
around
to
listen
to
the
argument
that
all
observed
handsome
tim
in
a
sulky
tone
not
spoiling
for
a
row
it
the
dance
we
after
then
give
up
the
revolvers
said
beth
coming
to
her
assistance
if
this
is
to
be
a
peaceful
entertainment
you
will
not
need
to
be
armed
and
it
is
absurd
to
suppose
a
lady
will
dance
with
a
gentleman
who
is
a
walking
arsenal
they
looked
into
one
another
faces
uncertainly
sat
softly
tuning
his
violin
as
if
uninterested
in
the
controversy
uncle
john
and
the
major
looked
on
with
seeming
indifference
you
must
decide
which
you
prefer
the
revolvers
or
the
dance
remarked
patsy
staring
coolly
into
the
ring
of
faces
would
your
english
ladies
at
home
consent
to
dance
with
armed
men
asked
beth
they
quite
right
boys
said
stubby
nodding
his
bullethead
let
agree
to
deposit
all
the
shooting
irons
the
dance
is
over
i
wo
cried
knuckles
his
scowl
deepening
by
jove
you
will
shouted
tobey
with
unexpected
vehemence
delaying
the
programme
old
man
and
it
a
nuisance
to
dance
in
this
armor
anyway
here
pile
all
your
guns
in
this
corner
every
one
of
you
mind
then
we
shall
all
stand
on
an
equal
footing
put
them
on
the
table
there
by
the
old
fiddler
said
patsy
then
we
will
know
we
are
perfectly
safe
rather
unwillingly
they
complied
each
man
walking
up
to
the
table
and
placing
his
revolver
at
feet
the
girls
watched
them
intently
that
man
over
there
is
still
armed
called
beth
pointing
to
a
swarthy
mexican
who
squatted
near
the
door
that
all
right
said
tobey
easily
he
our
guard
pedro
stationed
him
there
so
you
wo
attempt
to
escape
till
we
get
ready
to
let
you
go
patsy
laughed
there
little
danger
of
that
she
said
all
ready
now
exclaimed
knuckles
impatiently
we
all
as
harmless
as
doves
let
go
the
old
man
was
just
then
assisting
uncle
john
to
lift
myrtle
to
the
top
of
the
table
where
the
major
had
placed
a
chair
for
her
knuckles
growled
but
waited
until
the
girl
was
seated
near
the
window
then
drew
his
bow
and
struck
up
a
spirited
march
patsy
took
the
arm
of
knuckles
and
paraded
down
the
long
room
beth
followed
with
tobey
and
behind
them
tramped
the
remittance
men
in
files
of
two
at
the
far
end
were
grouped
the
servants
looking
curiously
upon
the
scene
which
was
lighted
by
lamps
swung
from
the
ceiling
and
a
row
of
candles
upon
the
edge
of
the
mantelshelf
to
carry
out
the
idea
of
a
grand
march
patsy
drew
her
escort
here
and
there
by
sharp
turns
and
half
circles
the
others
trailing
behind
like
a
huge
snake
until
she
had
passed
down
the
length
of
the
room
and
started
to
return
up
the
other
side
to
the
starting
point
so
engrossed
had
been
the
cowboys
that
they
did
not
observe
the
major
and
uncle
john
clamber
upon
the
table
and
stand
beside
myrtle
the
procession
was
half
way
up
the
hall
on
its
return
when
patsy
said
abruptly
now
beth
and
darted
away
from
her
partner
side
and
toward
the
table
beth
followed
like
a
streak
being
an
excellent
runner
and
for
a
moment
knuckles
and
tobey
thus
deserted
by
their
partners
stopped
to
watch
them
in
amazement
then
their
comrades
bumped
into
them
and
recalled
them
to
their
senses
by
that
time
the
two
girls
had
reached
the
table
and
leaped
upon
it
uncle
john
was
waving
his
handkerchief
from
the
window
as
a
signal
to
wampus
had
laid
aside
his
fiddle
and
seized
a
revolver
in
either
hand
and
the
major
had
caught
up
two
more
of
the
discarded
weapons
as
beth
and
patsy
turned
panting
and
from
their
elevation
looked
up
the
room
the
cowboys
gave
a
bellow
of
rage
and
rushed
forward
keep
back
shouted
the
major
in
stentorian
tones
i
shoot
the
first
man
that
interferes
noting
the
grim
determination
in
the
old
soldier
eye
they
hesitated
and
came
to
a
halt
what
do
you
mean
by
this
infernal
nonsense
cried
tobey
in
disgust
why
it
just
checkmate
and
the
game
is
up
replied
uncle
john
amiably
we
decided
not
to
hold
the
proposed
dance
but
to
take
our
departure
at
once
he
turned
and
passed
myrtle
out
of
the
window
where
wampus
took
her
in
his
arms
crutches
and
all
and
carried
her
to
the
automobile
the
remittance
men
unarmed
and
confronted
by
their
own
revolvers
stood
gaping
and
seemingly
dazed

uncle

he
gathered
up
the
firearms
one
by
one
and
tossed
them
through
the
window
then
he
straightened
up
and
a
shot
flashed
down
the
hall
and
tumbled
the
big
mexican
guard
to
the
floor
just
as
he
was
about
to
glide
through
the
doorway
dit

the
major
took
the
violin
and
climbed
through
the
window
proceeding
to
join
the
others
who
were
by
now
seated
in
the
car
when
he
had
gone
prepared
to
follow
first
backing
toward
the
window
and
then
turning
to
make
an
agile
leap
to
the
ground
below
and
now
with
a
shout
the
cowboys
made
their
rush
only
to
halt
as
reappeared
at
the
window
covering
them
again
with
his
revolvers
so
you
defils

he
slowly
backed
away
from
the
window
and
so
thoroughly
cowed
was
the
group
of
ruffians
that
the
old
fiddler
had
been
lifted
hastily
into
the
automobile
before
the
cowboys
mustered
courage
to
leap
through
the
window
and
search
in
the
darkness
for
their
revolvers
which
lay
scattered
widely
upon
the
ground
wampus
chuckling
gleefully
jerked
the
hoods
off
his
glaring
searchlights
sprang
to
his
seat
and
started
the
machine
down
the
road
before
the
crack
of
a
single
revolver
was
heard
in
protest
the
shots
came
thicker
after
that
but
now
the
automobile
was
bowling
merrily
along
the
road
and
soon
was
out
of
range
de
road
iss
exceptionalment
goot
remarked
dere

said
the
chauffeur
scornfully
who

for

i

wampus
an

we

said
patsy
contentedly
nestling
against
the
cushions
and
i
free
to
confess
that
i
mighty
glad
of
it
chapter
xv
the
romance
of
it
did
not
take
them
very
long
to
reach
the
river
a
muddy
little
stream
set
below
high
banks
by
direction
they
turned
to
the
left
and
followed
the
wind
of
the
river
for
a
mile
or
so
until
suddenly
out
of
the
darkness
loomed
a
quaint
little
bungalow
which
the
old
german
claimed
to
be
his
home
i
haf
architectured
it
mineself
unt
make
it
built
as
i
like
it
you

shtop
der

mit
me
he
said
as
wampus
halted
the
machine
before
the
door
there
was
a
little
murmur
of
protest
at
this
for
the
house
appeared
to
be
scarcely
bigger
than
the
automobile
but
uncle
john
pointed
out
sensibly
enough
that
they
ought
not
to
undertake
an
unknown
road
at
nighttime
and
that
spotville
the
town
for
which
they
were
headed
was
still
a
long
way
off
the
major
moreover
had
a
vivid
recollection
of
his
last
night
bed
upon
the
roof
of
the
limousine
where
he
had
crept
to
escape
rattlesnakes
and
was
in
no
mood
to
again
camp
out
in
the
open
while
they
traveled
in
arizona
so
he
advocated
accepting
invitation
the
girls
curious
to
know
how
so
many
could
be
accommodated
in
the
bungalow
withdrew
all
further
objections
and
stood
upon
the
low
porch
while
their
host
went
inside
to
light
the
lamps
they
were
really
surprised
at
the
cosy
aspect
of
the
place
half
the
dwelling
was
devoted
to
a
living
room
furnished
simply
but
with
modest
taste
a
big
square
table
was
littered
with
music
much
being
in
manuscript
thus
proving
assertion
that
he
was
a
composer
benches
were
as
numerous
as
chairs
and
all
were
with
tanned
skins
as
coverings
a
few
good
prints
were
on
the
walls
and
the
aspect
of
the
place
was
entirely
agreeable
to
the
old
man
guests
as
the
room
was
somewhat
chilly
he
made
a
fire
in
the
ample
fireplace
and
then
with
an
air
of
pride
exhibited
to
his
visitors
his
tiny
kitchen
his
own
bedroom
and
a
storeroom
which
occupied
the
remainder
of
the
space
in
the
bungalow
he
told
them
he
would
prepare
beds
in
the
living
room
for
the
girls
give
his
own
room
to
merrick
and
major
doyle
while
he
and
wampus
would
bunk
in
the
storeroom
i
haf
much
blankets
he
said
dere
vill
be
no
troubles
to
keep
varm
afterward
they
sat
before
the
fire
and
by
the
dim
lights
of
the
kerosene
lamps
chatted
together
of
the
day
adventures
uncle
john
asked
what
had
brought
him
to
this
deserted
spot
and
the
old
man
told
his
story
in
a
manner
that
amused
them
all
greatly

so
after

time
i

here
vy
nod
i
am
forgot
in
stuttgart
there
was
pathos
in
the
tale
and
his
way
of
telling
it
the
old
man
spoke
cheerfully
but
they
could
see
before
them
the
tragedy
depicted
by
his
simple
words
his
hearers
were
all
silent
when
he
had
concluded
feeling
they
could
say
nothing
to
console
him
or
lighten
his
burden
only
wampus
sitting
in
the
background
looked
scornfully
upon
the
man
who
had
once
been
the
idol
of
his
townspeople
took
a
violin
from
a
shelf
and
began
to
play
softly
but
with
masterly
execution
he
caught
their
mood
instantly
the
harmony
was
restful
and
contented
patsy
turned
down
the
lamps
to
let
the
flicker
of
the
firelight
dominate
the
room
and
understood
and
blended
the
flickering
light
into
his
melody
for
a
long
time
he
continued
to
improvise
in
a
way
that
fairly
captivated
his
hearers
despite
their
varied
temperaments
and
made
them
wonder
at
his
skill
then
without
warning
he
changed
to
a
stirring
martial
air
that
filled
the
room
with
its
rich
resonant
tones
there
was
a
fugue
a
wonderful
finale
and
while
the
concluding
notes
rang
in
their
ears
the
old
man
laid
his
violin
in
his
lap
leaned
back
against
his
cushions
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh
they
forebore
disturbing
him
for
a
while
how
strange
it
seemed
that
this
really
talented
musician
should
be
banished
to
a
wilderness
while
still
possessing
power
to
stir
the
souls
of
men
with
his
marvelous
execution
truly
he
was
a
maestro
as
he
had
said
a
genius
whose
star
had
risen
flashed
across
the
sky
and
suddenly
faded
leaving
his
future
a
blank
wampus
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
i
like
to
know
something
he
remarked
roused
himself
and
turned
to
look
at
the
speaker
you
have
one
bad
eye
continued
wampus
reflectively
what
make
him
so
you
stick
violin
bow
in
eye
some
day
no
grunted
bad
eye
he
no
make
himself
persisted
the
little
chauffeur
what
make
him
then
for
a
moment
there
was
an
awkward
silence
the
girls
considered
this
personal
inquiry
offensive
and
regretted
admitting
wampus
to
the
room
but
after
a
time
the
old
german
answered
the
question
quietly
and
in
a
half
amused
tone
can
you
nod
guess
he
said
herr
gabert
hurt
mine
eye
oh
exclaimed
wampus
nodding
approvingly
you

with
him
of
course
it
mus

howefer
continued
it

said
wampus
but
herr
gabert
what
happen
to
him
again
there
was
a
pause
then
the
german
said
slowly
i

rich
but
efery

i
send
a
leetle
money
to
stuttgart
to
put
some
flowers
on
herr

grave
the
chauffeur
face
brightened
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
solemnly
shook
hand
you
are
great
musician
he
announced
you
can
believe
it
for
it
is
true
an
you

chapter
xvi
the
lodging
at
spotville
wake
up
patsy
i
smell
coffee
called
beth
and
soon
the
two
girls
were
dressed
and
assisting
myrtle
to
complete
her
toilet
through
the
open
windows
came
the
cool
fragrant
breath
of
morning
the
sky
was
beginning
to
blush
at
the
coming
of
the
sun
to
think
of
our
getting
up
at
such
unearthly
hours
cried
patsy
cheerfully
but
i
do
mind
it
in
the
least
beth
do
you
i
love
the
daybreak
returned
beth
softly
we
wasted
the
best
hours
of
morning
abed
patsy
these
many
years
but
there
a
difference
said
myrtle
earnestly
i
know
the
daybreak
in
the
city
very
well
for
nearly
all
my
life
i
have
had
to
rise
in
the
dark
in
order
to
get
my
breakfast
and
be
at
work
on
time
it
is
different
from
this
i
assure
you
especially
in
winter
when
the
chill
strikes
through
to
your
bones
even
in
summer
time
the
air
of
the
city
is
overheated
and
close
and
the
early
mornings
cheerless
and
uncomfortable
then
i
think
it
is
best
to
stay
in
bed
as
long
as
you
can
if
you
have
nothing
else
to
do
but
here
out
in
the
open
it
seems
a
shame
not
to
be
up
with
the
birds
to
breathe
the
scent
of
the
fields
and
watch
the
sun
send
his
heralds
ahead
of
him
to
proclaim
his
coming
and
then
climb
from
the
bottomless
pit
into
the
sky
and
take
possession
of
it
why
myrtle
exclaimed
patsy
wonderingly
what
a
poetic
notion
how
did
it
get
into
your
head
little
one
myrtle
sweet
face
rivaled
the
sunrise
for
a
moment
she
made
no
reply
but
only
smiled
pathetically
uncle
john
knock
upon
the
door
found
them
ready
for
breakfast
which
old
had
skilfully
prepared
in
the
tiny
kitchen
and
now
placed
upon
a
round
table
set
out
upon
the
porch
by
the
time
they
had
finished
the
simple
meal
wampus
had
had
his
coffee
and
prepared
the
automobile
for
the
day
journey
a
few
minutes
later
they
said
to
the
aged
musician
and
took
the
trail
that
led
through
spotville
the
day
trip
was
without
event
they
encountered
one
or
two
indians
on
the
way
jogging
slowly
along
on
their
shaggy
ponies
but
the
creatures
were
mild
and
inoffensive
the
road
was
fairly
good
and
they
made
excellent
time
so
that
long
before
twilight
spotville
was
reached
and
the
party
had
taken
possession
of
the
one
small
and
primitive
hotel
the
place
afforded
it
was
a
clapboarded
building
the
lower
floor
being
devoted
to
the
bar
and
dining
room
while
the
second
story
was
divided
into
bedrooms
none
too
clean
and
very
cheaply
furnished
i
imagine
we
shall
find
this
place
limit
remarked
uncle
john
ruefully
but
surely
we
shall
be
able
to
stand
it
for
one
night
he
added
with
a
philosophic
sigh
want
meat

asked
the
landlord
a
tall
gaunt
man
who
considered
himself
dressed
when
he
was
in
his
shirt
sleeves
what
kind
of
meat
inquired
uncle
john
cautiously

and

smiled
delightedly

the
major
took
him
aside
he
did
not
tell
the
cautious
landlord
that
merrick
was
one
of
the
wealthiest
men
in
america
but
he
exhibited
a
roll
of
bills
that
satisfied
the
man
his
demands
would
be
paid
in
full
the
touring
party
feasted
upon
eggs
and
fresh
milk
both
very
delicious
but
accompanied
by
odds
and
ends
of
food
not
so
palatable
the
landlord
two
daughters
sallow
sunken
cheeked
girls
waited
on
the
guests
and
the
landlord
wife
did
the
cooking
beth
patsy
and
myrtle
retired
early
as
did
uncle
john
the
major
smoking
his
bedtime
cigar
as
he
called
it
strolled
out
into
the
yard
and
saw
wampus
seated
in
the
automobile
also
smoking
we
get
an
early
start
wampus
said
the
major
better
get
to
bed
here
is
my
bed
returned
the
chauffeur
quietly
but
there
a
room
reserved
for
you
in
the
hotel
i
know
do
want
him
i
sleep
me
here
the
major
looked
at
him
reflectively
ever
been
in
this
town
before
wampus
he
asked
no
sir
but
i
been
in
other
towns
like
him
an
know
this
kind
of
hotel
then
why
do
i
sleep
in
front
seat
of
motor
car
because
you
are
foolish
i
suppose
being
born
that
way
and
unable
to
escape
your
heritage
for
my
part
i
shall
sleep
in
a
bed
like
a
christian
said
the
major
rather
testily
even
christian
can
not
sleep
sometime
returned
wampus
leaning
back
in
his
seat
and
puffing
a
cloud
of
smoke
into
the
clear
night
air
for
me
i
am
good
christian
but
i
am
not
martyr
what
do
you
mean
by
that
demanded
the
major
do
you
sometime
gamble
inquired
wampus
softly
not
often
sir
but
sometime
ah
then
i
make
you
a
bet
i
bet
you
ten
dollar
to
one
cent
you
not
sleep
in
your
bed
the
major
coughed
then
he
frowned
is
it
so
bad
as
that
he
asked
i
think
he
is
i
not
believe
it
exclaimed
major
doyle
this
hotel
is
what
you
might
call
and
ca
rank
with
the
but
i
imagine
the
beds
will
be
very
comfortable
once
said
wampus
i
have
imagination
too
now
i
have
experience
so
i
sleep
in
automobile
the
major
walked
away
with
an
exclamation
of
impatience
he
had
never
possessed
much
confidence
in
the
canadian
judgment
and
on
this
occasion
he
considered
the
fellow
little
wiser
than
a
fool
wampus
rolled
himself
in
a
rug
and
was
about
to
stretch
his
moderate
length
upon
the
broad
double
seat
when
a
pattering
of
footsteps
was
heard
and
beth
came
up
to
the
car
she
was
wrapped
in
a
dark
cloak
and
carried
a
bundle
of
clothing
under
one
arm
and
her
satchel
in
the
unoccupied
hand
there
was
a
new
moon
which
dimly
lighted
the
scene
but
as
all
the
townspeople
were
now
in
bed
and
the
hotel
yard
deserted
there
was
no
one
to
remark
upon
the
girl
appearance
wampus
she
said
let
me
into
the
limousine
please
the
night
is
so
perfect
i
decided
to
sleep
here
in
the
car
the
chauffeur
jumped
down
and
opened
the
door
one
moment
an
i
make
up
the
beds
for
all
he
said
never
mind
that
beth
answered
the
others
are
all
asleep
sure
wampus
shook
his
head
they
all
be
here
pretty
soon
he
predicted
and
proceeded
to
deftly
prepare
the
interior
of
the
limousine
for
the
expected
party
when
beth
had
entered
the
car
wampus
pitched
the
tent
and
arranged
the
cots
as
he
was
accustomed
to
do
when
they
camped
out
scarcely
had
he
completed
this
task
when
patsy
and
myrtle
appeared
they
began
to
explain
their
presence
but
wampus
interrupted
them
saying
all
right
miss
patsy
an
miss
myrtle
your
beds
he
made
up
an
miss
already
asleep
in
him
so
they
crept
inside
with
sighs
of
relief
and
wampus
had
just
mounted
to
the
front
seat
again
and
disposed
himself
to
rest
when
uncle
john
trotted
up
clad
in
his
trousers
and
shirt
with
the
balance
of
his
apparel
clasped
in
his
arms
he
looked
at
the
tent
with
pleased
approval
good
boy
wampus
he
exclaimed
that
room
they
gave
me
is
an
inferno
i
afraid
our
young
ladies
wo
sleep
a
wink
oh
yes
returned
wampus
with
a
nod
all
three
now
inside
car
safe
an
happy
i
glad
of
it
how
was
your
own
room
wampus
i
have
not
seen
him
sir
but
i
have
suspect
him
so
i
sleep
here
you
are
a
wise
chauffeur
a
rare
genus
in
other
words
good
night
wampus
where
the
major
wampus
chuckled
in
hotel
sir
do
the
major
swear
sometime
uncle
john
crept
under
the
tent
if
he
does
he
responded
he
swearing
this
blessed
minute
anyhow
i
guarantee
he
not
asleep
wampus
again
mounted
to
his
perch
no
use
my
try
to
sleep
major
he
come
he
muttered
and
settled
himself
to
wait
it
was
not
long
presently
some
one
approached
on
a
run
and
a
broad
grin
overspread
the
chauffeur
features
the
major
had
not
delayed
his
escape
long
enough
to
don
his
trousers
even
he
had
grabbed
his
belongings
in
both
arms
and
fled
in
his
blue
and
white
striped
undergarments
wampus
leaped
down
and
lifted
the
flap
of
the
tent
the
major
paused
long
enough
in
the
moonlight
to
stare
at
the
chauffeur
and
say
sternly
if
you
utter
one
syllable
you
rascal
i
punch
your
head
wampus
was
discreet
he
said
not
a
word
chapter
xvii
yellow
poppies
so
this
is
california
exclaimed
patsy
gleefully
as
the
automobile
left
parker
and
crossed
the
arizona
line
but
it
does
look
any
different
said
myrtle
peering
out
of
the
window
of
course
not
observed
uncle
john
a
state
boundary
is
a
thing
and
does
affect
the
country
a
bit
we
just
climbed
a
miniature
mountain
back
in
arizona
and
now
we
must
climb
a
mate
to
it
in
california
but
the
fact
is
we
entered
at
last
the
land
of
enchantment
and
every
mile
now
will
bring
us
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
roses
and
sunshine
there
sunshine
here
now
declared
the
major
we
had
it
right
along
but
i
have
seen
the
roses
yet
and
a
pair
of
ear
muffs
would
be
uncomfortable
in
this
cutting
breeze
the
air
rather
crisp
admitted
uncle
john
but
we
still
in
the
mountainous
district
and
haggerty
says
the
major
coughed
derisively
and
mumbles
barked
and
looked
at
uncle
john
sagaciously
haggerty
says
is
that
a
rabbit
or
a
squirrel
something
has
caught
the
eye
of
our
mumbles
interrupted
the
major
pointing
vaguely
across
the
mesa
haggerty
says
i
wonder
if
mumbles
could
catch
remarked
the
major
with
complacence
he
says
that
every
mile
we
travel
brings
us
nearer
the
scent
of
the
orange
blossoms
and
the
glare
of
the
yellow
poppies
persisted
uncle
john
you
see
we
taken
the
southern
route
after
all
for
soon
we
shall
be
on
the
imperial
road
which
leads
to
san
diego
in
the
heart
of
the
gorgeous
southland
what
is
the
imperial
road
inquired
beth
the
turnpike
through
imperial
valley
said
to
be
the
richest
bit
of
land
in
all
the
world
not
excepting
the
famous
nile
banks
of
egypt
there
is
no
railway
there
yet
but
the
valley
is
settling
very
fast
and
haggerty
says
how
remarkable
exclaimed
the
major
gazing
straight
ahead
and
again
mumbles
curled
in
patsy
lap
lifted
his
shaggy
head
and
gave
a
wailing
bark
uncle
john
frowned
but
was
loyal
to
haggerty
he
says
that
if
america
was
now
unknown
to
all
the
countries
of
the
world
imperial
would
soon
make
it
famous
they
grow
wonderful
crops
there
strawberries
and
melons
the
year
around
as
well
as
all
the
tropical
and
fruits
and
grains
flowers
and
vines
known
to
any
country
yet
discovered
do
we
go
to
imperial
asked
myrtle
eagerly
i
think
not
my
dear
we
just
skirt
the
edge
of
the
valley
rather
wild
and
primitive
there
yet
for
although
many
settlers
are
flocking
to
that
favored
district
imperial
is
large
enough
to
be
an
empire
by
itself
however
we
shall
find
an
ideal
climate
at
coronado
by
the
edge
of
the
blue
pacific
and
there
and
at
los
angeles
we
shall
rest
from
our
journey
and
get
acquainted
with
the
wonders
of
the
golden
state
has
the
trip
tired
you
girls
not
me
answered
beth
promptly
i
enjoyed
every
mile
of
the
way
and
so
have
i
added
patsy
except
perhaps
the
adventure
with
the
remittance
men
but
i
would
care
to
have
missed
even
that
for
it
led
to
our
acquaintance
with
old
for
my
part
said
myrtle
softly
i
been
in
a
real
fairyland
it
has
seemed
like
a
dream
to
me
all
this
glorious
journey
and
i
shall
hate
to
wake
up
as
i
must
in
time
do
worry
just
yet
about
the
awakening
dear
returned
patsy
leaning
over
to
kiss
her
little
friend
just
enjoy
it
while
you
can
if
fairylands
exist
they
were
made
for
just
such
as
you
myrtle
one
of
the
greatest
marvels
of
our
trip
said
the
major
with
a
smile
is
the
improvement
in
our
dear
little
invalid
it
is
the
same
myrtle
who
started
out
with
us
believe
me
ca
you
all
see
the
change
i
can
it
returned
myrtle
happily
and
do
you
notice
how
well
i
walk
and
how
little
use
i
have
now
for
the
crutches
and
can
you
feel
the
rosy
cheeks
and
bright
eyes
too
asked
uncle
john
regarding
her
with
much
satisfaction
the
trip
was
just
the
thing
for
myrtle
added
patsy
she
has
grown
stronger
every
day
but
she
is
not
quite
well
yet
you
know
and
i
depend
a
good
deal
upon
the
genial
climate
of
california
to
insure
her
complete
recovery
uncle
john
did
not
reply
he
remembered
the
doctor
assertion
that
a
painful
operation
would
be
necessary
to
finally
restore
myrtle
to
a
normal
condition
and
his
kindly
heart
disliked
to
reflect
upon
the
ordeal
before
the
poor
girl
haggerty
proved
a
prophet
after
all
each
mile
they
covered
opened
new
vistas
of
delight
to
the
eager
travelers
the
air
grew
more
balmy
as
they
left
the
high
altitudes
and
came
upon
the
level
country
to
the
north
of
the
san
bernardino
range
of
mountains
nor
was
it
long
before
they
sighted
imperial
and
sped
through
miles
of
country
carpeted
with
the
splendid
yellow
poppies
which
the
state
has
adopted
as
the
emblems
of
california
and
behind
this
golden
robe
loomed
the
cotton
fields
of
imperial
one
of
the
most
fascinating
sights
the
traveler
may
encounter
they
made
a
curve
to
the
right
here
and
headed
northerly
until
they
came
to
salton
skirting
the
edge
of
the
curious
salton
sea
they
now
headed
directly
west
toward
escondido
finding
the
roads
remarkably
good
and
for
long
stretches
as
smooth
and
hard
as
an
asphalt
boulevard
the
three
days
it
took
them
to
cross
the
state
were
days
of
wonder
and
delight
it
was
not
long
before
they
encountered
the
roses
and
carnations
growing
on
every
side
which
the
major
had
persistently
declared
to
be
mythical
it
seems
all
wrong
asserted
patsy
father
moodily
for
such
delicate
flowers
to
be
growing
out
of
doors
in
midwinter
and
look
at
the
grass
why
the
seasons
are
changed
about
it
springtime
just
now
in
california
the
man
at
the
last
stop
we
made
told
me
his
roses
bloomed
the
year
round
said
patsy
and
just
smell
the
orange
blossoms
will
you
are
they
sweet
and
do
they
remind
you
of
brides
from
escondido
it
was
a
short
run
to
the
sea
and
their
first
glimpse
of
the
majestic
pacific
was
from
a
high
bluff
overhanging
the
water
from
this
point
the
road
ran
south
to
san
diego
skirting
the
coast
along
a
mountain
trail
that
is
admitted
to
be
one
of
the
most
picturesque
rides
in
america
descending
the
hills
as
they
neared
san
diego
they
passed
through
fields
of
splendid
wild
flowers
so
extensive
and
beautiful
that
our
girls
fairly
gasped
in
wonder
the
yellow
and
orange
poppies
predominated
but
there
were
acres
of
wild
mustard
throwing
countless
numbers
of
gorgeous
saffron
spikes
skyward
and
vistas
of
blue
carconnes
white
daisies
and
delandres
the
yucca
was
in
bloom
too
and
added
its
mammoth
flower
to
the
display
they
did
not
halt
at
san
diego
the
southernmost
city
of
california
from
whence
the
mexican
line
is
in
plain
sight
but
drove
to
the
bay
where
wampus
guided
the
limousine
on
to
the
big
ferryboat
bound
for
coronado
they
all
left
the
car
during
the
brief
voyage
and
watched
the
porpoises
sporting
in
the
clear
water
of
the
bay
and
gazed
abstractedly
at
the
waving
palms
on
the
opposite
shore
where
lies
nestled
the
crown
of
the
pacific
coronado
chapter
xviii
the
silent
man
even
the
major
smiled
benignantly
when
he
reached
his
appointed
room
in
the
magnificent
hotel
del
coronado
which
is
famed
throughout
the
world
this
said
he
reminds
me
of
new
york
and
it
the
first
thing
that
has
since
i
left
home
why
daddy
it
is
like
new
york
at
all
protested
patsy
standing
beside
him
at
the
broad
window
overlooking
the
ocean
did
you
ever
see
a
palm
tree
waving
in
new
york
or
daisy
bushes
as
tall
as
a
man
or
such
masses
of
roses
and
flowering
vines
and
then
just
notice
the
mountains
over
there
they
in
mexico
i
told
and
this
great
headland
in
the
other
direction
it
called
point
loma
oh
i
never
imagined
any
place
could
be
so
beautiful
the
others
were
equally
excited
and
uncle
john
said
smiling
broadly
well
we
here
at
last
my
dears
and
i
sure
we
are
already
well
paid
for
our
trip
across
the
continent
what
pleasant
rooms
these
are
if
the
hotel
table
is
at
all
to
be
compared
with
the
house
itself
we
shall
have
a
happy
time
here
which
means
we
will
stay
as
long
as
possible
but
the
table
was
another
surprise
for
the
meals
were
equal
to
any
served
in
the
great
eastern
metropolis
uncle
john
complimented
the
landlord
a
cheery
faced
fat
little
man
who
had
at
one
time
managed
a
famous
new
york
hotel
and
had
brought
his
talents
and
experience
to
far
california
i
sorry
said
this
gentle
boniface
that
i
could
not
reserve
better
rooms
for
you
for
there
are
some
choice
views
from
some
locations
i
had
a
corner
suite
saved
for
your
party
a
suite
i
consider
the
most
desirable
in
the
hotel
but
an
eccentric
individual
arrived
yesterday
who
demanded
the
entire
suite
and
i
had
to
let
him
have
it
he
will
not
stay
long
and
as
soon
as
he
goes
you
shall
have
the
rooms
who
is
he
asked
uncle
john
a
rich
miner
a
most
melancholy
and
peculiar
person
by
the
way
replied
landlord
ross
i
believe
his
name
is
jones
merrick
started
jones
and
a
miner
he
said
what
his
other
name
anson
we
look
and
see
replied
ross
turning
to
the
hotel
register
no
not
anson
he
is
registered
as
jones
of
boston
oh
that
not
the
jones
at
all
said
uncle
john
disappointed
it
the
jones
who
is
our
guest
replied
the
landlord
smiling
meantime
the
three
girls
had
gone
for
a
walk
along
the
coast
the
beach
is
beautiful
at
coronado
there
is
a
high
sea
wall
of
rock
and
the
path
runs
along
its
edge
almost
the
length
of
the
promontory
the
rocks
are
sloping
however
and
it
is
not
very
difficult
to
climb
down
them
to
where
the
waves
break
against
the
wall
near
the
hotel
they
met
straggling
groups
strolling
in
either
direction
but
half
a
mile
away
the
promenade
was
practically
deserted
it
was
beginning
to
grow
dark
and
beth
said
regretfully
we
must
get
back
girls
and
dress
for
dinner
an
unusual
luxury
is
it
our
trunks
arrived
at
the
hotel
two
weeks
ago
and
are
now
in
our
rooms
doubtless
awaiting
us
to
unpack
them
do
let
return
just
yet
begged
myrtle
i
want
to
see
the
sun
set
it
will
be
gorgeous
said
patsy
glancing
at
the
sky
but
we
can
see
it
from
our
windows
and
as
we
a
long
way
from
the
hotel
now
i
believe
beth
suggestion
is
wise
so
they
began
to
retrace
their
steps
myrtle
still
walked
with
some
difficulty
and
they
had
not
proceeded
far
when
beth
exclaimed
look
at
that
man
down
there
her
companions
followed
her
direction
and
saw
standing
upon
a
huge
pile
of
rocks
at
the
water
edge
a
slight
solitary
figure
something
in
the
poise
as
he
leaned
forward
staring
at
the
darkened
waves
for
the
sun
was
low
and
cast
shadows
aslant
the
water
struck
myrtle
as
familiar
oh
girls
she
exclaimed
it
the
grand
canyon
man
why
i
believe
it
is
agreed
patsy
what
is
he
doing
nothing
said
beth
briefly
but
he
is
going
to
do
something
i
think
while
they
stared
at
him
from
their
elevation
the
man
straightened
an
instant
and
cast
a
hasty
glance
to
either
side
the
place
seemed
to
him
deserted
for
he
failed
to
observe
the
group
of
three
intently
watching
his
motions
from
the
high
bank
overhead
next
moment
he
turned
back
to
the
water
and
leaned
over
the
edge
of
rock
again
do
cried
myrtle
her
clear
voice
ringing
over
the
lap
of
the
waves
please
do
he
swung
around
and
turned
his
gaunt
features
upward
to
where
the
young
girl
leaned
upon
her
crutches
with
clasped
hands
and
a
look
of
distress
upon
her
sweet
face
do
she
repeated
pleadingly
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
with
a
very
weary
gesture
and
looked
at
myrtle
again
this
time
quite
steadily
she
was
trembling
in
every
limb
and
her
cheeks
were
white
with
fear
slowly
very
slowly
the
man
turned
and
began
to
climb
the
rocks
not
directly
upward
to
where
the
girls
stood
but
diagonally
so
as
to
reach
the
walk
some
distance
ahead
of
them
they
did
not
move
until
he
had
gained
the
path
and
turned
toward
the
hotel
then
they
followed
and
kept
him
in
sight
until
he
reached
the
entrance
to
the
court
and
disappeared
within
i
wonder
said
patsy
as
they
made
their
way
to
their
rooms
whether
he
really
was
thinking
of
plunging
into
the
ocean
or
whether
that
time
at
the
grand
canyon
he
had
a
notion
of
jumping
into
the
chasm
if
so
added
beth
myrtle
has
saved
his
life
twice
but
she
be
always
near
to
watch
the
man
and
if
he
has
suicidal
intentions
he
make
an
end
of
himself
sooner
or
later
without
a
doubt
perhaps
said
myrtle
hesitatingly
i
am
quite
wrong
and
the
strange
man
had
no
intention
of
doing
himself
an
injury
but
each
time
i
obeyed
an
impulse
that
compelled
me
to
cry
out
and
afterward
i
have
been
much
ashamed
of
my
forwardness
they
did
not
see
the
melancholy
man
at
dinner
but
afterward
in
the
spacious
lobby
they
discovered
him
sitting
in
a
far
corner
reading
a
magazine
he
seemed
intent
on
this
occupation
and
paid
no
attention
to
the
life
around
him
the
girls
called
uncle
john
attention
to
him
and
merrick
at
once
recognized
him
as
the
same
individual
they
had
met
at
the
grand
canyon
but
i
am
not
especially
pleased
to
encounter
him
again
he
said
with
a
slight
frown
for
if
i
remember
aright
he
acted
very
rudely
to
myrtle
and
proved
unsociable
when
i
made
overtures
and
spoke
to
him
i
wonder
who
he
is
mused
patsy
watching
the
weary
haggard
features
as
his
eyes
slowly
followed
the
lines
of
his
magazine
i
inquire
and
find
out
replied
her
uncle
the
cherubic
landlord
was
just
then
pacing
up
and
down
the
lobby
pausing
here
and
there
to
interchange
a
word
with
his
guests
uncle
john
approached
him
and
said
can
you
tell
me
ross
who
the
gentleman
is
in
the
corner
the
landlord
looked
around
at
the
corner
and
smiled
that
said
he
is
the
gentleman
we
spoke
of
this
afternoon
jones
the
man
who
usurped
the
rooms
intended
for
you
rooms
repeated
uncle
john
has
he
a
large
party
then
he
is
alone
that
is
the
queer
part
of
it
returned
the
landlord
nor
has
he
much
baggage
but
he
liked
the
suite
a
parlor
with
five
rooms
opening
out
of
it
and
insisted
upon
having
them
all
despite
the
fact
that
it
is
one
of
the
most
expensive
suites
in
the
hotel
i
said
he
was
eccentric
did
i
not
you
were
justified
said
merrick
thought
fully
thank
you
sir
for
the
information
even
as
he
rejoined
the
girls
who
were
seated
together
upon
a
broad
divan
the
man
arose
laid
down
his
magazine
and
came
slowly
down
the
room
evidently
headed
for
the
elevator
but
with
a
start
he
recognized
the
girl
who
had
accosted
him
on
the
beach
and
the
others
with
her
and
for
an
instant
came
to
a
full
stop
before
the
group
his
sad
eyes
fixed
intently
upon
myrtle
face
the
situation
was
a
bit
awkward
and
to
relieve
it
uncle
john
remarked
in
his
cheery
voice
well
jones
we
meet
again
you
see
the
man
turned
slowly
and
faced
him
then
bowed
in
a
mechanical
way
and
proceeded
to
the
elevator
into
which
he
disappeared
naturally
uncle
john
was
indignant
confound
the
fellow
he
exclaimed
he
worse
than
a
boor
but
perhaps
his
early
education
was
neglected
did
you
call
him
jones
sir
asked
myrtle
in
a
voice
that
trembled
with
excitement
yes
my
dear
but
it
is
not
your
uncle
anson
i
inquired
about
him
the
joneses
are
pretty
thick
wherever
you
go
but
i
hope
not
many
are
like
this
fellow
something
wrong
with
him
declared
patsy
he
had
some
sad
bereavement
a
great
blow
of
some
sort
and
it
has
made
him
somber
and
melancholy
he
does
seem
to
know
he
acts
rudely
you
can
tell
by
the
man
eyes
that
he
is
unhappy
his
eyes
have
neither
color
nor
expression
remarked
beth
at
his
best
this
jones
must
have
been
an
undesirable
acquaintance
you
ca
be
sure
of
that
returned
patsy
and
i
positive
my
theory
is
correct
more
and
more
am
i
inclined
to
agree
with
myrtle
that
he
is
disgusted
with
life
and
longs
to
end
it
let
him
then
retorted
uncle
john
i
sure
such
a
person
is
of
no
use
to
the
world
and
if
he
does
like
himself
he
better
out
of
it
that
kindly
merrick
should
give
vent
to
such
a
heartless
speech
proved
how
much
annoyed
he
had
been
by
jones
discourtesy
he
might
be
reclaimed
and
and
comforted
said
myrtle
softly
when
i
think
of
the
happiness
you
have
brought
into
my
life
sir
i
long
to
express
my
gratitude
by
making
some
one
else
happy
you
doing
it
little
one
he
answered
pinching
her
cheek
if
we
brought
a
bit
of
sunshine
into
your
life
we
reaped
an
ample
reward
in
your
companionship
but
if
you
can
find
a
way
to
comfort
that
man
jones
and
fetch
him
out
of
his
dumps
you
are
certainly
a
more
wonderful
fairy
than
i
given
you
credit
for
myrtle
did
not
reply
to
this
although
it
pleased
her
she
presently
pleaded
weariness
and
asked
permission
to
return
to
her
room
beth
and
patsy
wanted
to
go
into
the
great
domed
ballroom
and
watch
the
dancing
so
myrtle
bade
them
good
night
and
ascended
by
the
elevator
to
her
floor
chapter
xix
three
times
softly
stepping
over
the
thick
carpets
which
deadened
the
sound
of
the
crutches
now
becoming
scarcely
necessary
to
her
the
young
girl
passed
along
the
corridor
passing
angles
and
turns
innumerable
on
her
way
to
her
room
some
erratic
architect
certainly
concocted
the
plan
of
the
hotel
del
coronado
it
is
a
very
labyrinth
of
passages
connecting
its
nine
hundred
rooms
and
one
has
to
have
a
good
bump
of
location
to
avoid
getting
lost
in
its
mazes
near
one
of
the
abrupt
turns
a
door
stood
ajar
and
in
passing
myrtle
glanced
in
and
then
paused
involuntarily
it
was
a
small
parlor
prettily
furnished
and
in
a
big
chair
reclined
a
man
whose
hands
were
both
pressed
tight
against
his
face
thus
covering
it
completely
but
myrtle
knew
him
the
thin
frame
as
well
as
the
despairing
attitude
marked
him
as
the
man
who
had
come
so
strangely
into
her
life
and
whose
personality
affected
her
so
strangely
she
now
stood
in
the
dimly
lighted
corridor
looking
in
upon
him
with
infinite
pity
and
as
she
looked
her
glance
fell
upon
the
table
beside
him
where
something
bright
glittered
beneath
the
electric
lamps
her
heart
gave
a
sudden
thump
of
mingled
fear
and
dismay
she
knew
intuitively
what
that
something
was
let
him
uncle
john
had
said
but
myrtle
instantly
determined
to
let
him
she
hesitated
a
moment
but
seeing
that
the
man
remained
motionless
his
eyes
still
covered
as
if
lost
to
all
his
surroundings
she
softly
crept
forward
and
entered
the
room
she
held
the
crutches
under
her
arms
but
dared
not
use
them
for
fear
of
making
a
noise
step
by
step
she
stole
forward
until
the
table
was
within
reach
then
she
stretched
out
her
hand
seized
the
revolver
and
hid
it
in
the
folds
of
her
blouse
turning
for
a
final
glance
at
the
man
she
was
startled
to
find
he
had
removed
his
hands
and
was
steadfastly
regarding
her
myrtle
leaned
heavily
on
her
crutches
she
felt
faint
and
miserable
like
a
criminal
caught
in
the
act
as
her
eyes
fell
before
the
intent
gaze
her
face
turned
scarlet
with
humiliation
and
chagrin
still
she
did
not
attempt
to
escape
the
idea
not
occurring
to
her
so
for
a
time
the
tableau
was
picturesque
the
lame
girl
standing
motionless
with
downcast
eyes
and
the
man
fixedly
staring
at
her
three
times
he
slowly
said
in
a
voice
finally
stirred
by
a
trace
of
emotion
three
times
my
child
why
are
you
so
persistent
myrtle
tried
to
be
brave
and
meet
his
gaze
it
was
not
quite
so
difficult
now
the
silent
man
had
spoken
why
do
you
force
me
to
be
persistent
she
asked
a
tremor
in
her
voice
why
are
you
determined
to
to
words
failed
her
but
he
nodded
to
show
he
understood
because
said
he
i
am
tired
very
tired
my
child
it
a
big
world
too
big
in
fact
but
there
nothing
in
it
for
me
any
more
there
was
expression
enough
in
his
voice
now
expression
of
utter
despondency
why
asked
myrtle
somewhat
frightened
to
find
herself
so
bold
he
did
not
answer
for
a
long
time
but
sat
reading
her
mobile
face
until
a
gentler
look
came
into
his
hard
blue
eyes
it
is
a
story
too
sad
for
young
ears
he
finally
replied
perhaps
too
you
would
not
understand
it
not
knowing
or
understanding
me
an
odd
sort
of
man
well
along
in
years
and
i
lived
an
odd
sort
of
life
but
my
story
such
as
it
is
has
ended
and
i
too
weary
to
begin
another
volume
oh
no
exclaimed
myrtle
earnestly
surely
this
can
not
be
the
fulfillment
and
end
of
your
life
if
it
were
why
should
come
into
your
life
just
now
he
stared
at
her
with
a
surprised
an
even
startled
look
have
you
come
into
my
life
he
inquired
in
a
low
curious
tone
have
i
she
returned
at
the
grand
canyon
i
know
he
interrupted
hastily
that
was
your
mistake
and
mine
you
should
not
have
interfered
i
should
not
have
let
you
interfere
but
i
did
said
myrtle
yes
somehow
your
voice
sounded
like
a
command
and
i
obeyed
it
perhaps
because
no
living
person
has
a
right
to
command
me
you
you
took
me
by
surprise
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
with
that
weary
gesture
peculiar
to
him
and
then
fell
silent
myrtle
had
remained
standing
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
in
this
emergency
or
what
more
to
say
the
conversation
could
not
be
ended
in
this
summary
fashion
the
hopeless
man
needed
her
in
some
way
how
she
did
not
know
feeling
weak
and
very
incompetent
to
meet
the
important
crisis
properly
the
girl
crept
to
a
chair
opposite
the
man
and
sank
into
it
then
she
leaned
her
chin
upon
her
hand
and
looked
pleadingly
at
her
strange
acquaintance
he
met
her
eyes
frankly
the
hard
look
in
his
own
seemed
to
have
disappeared
dispelled
by
a
sympathy
that
was
new
to
him
and
so
they
sat
regarding
one
another
silently
yet
musingly
for
a
long
time
i
wish
said
myrtle
once
in
her
softest
sweetest
tones
i
could
help
you
some
one
helped
me
when
i
was
in
great
trouble
so
i
want
to
help
you
he
did
not
reply
and
another
period
of
silence
ensued
but
his
next
speech
showed
he
had
been
considering
her
words
because
you
have
suffered
he
said
you
have
compassion
for
others
who
suffer
but
your
trouble
is
over
now
almost
she
said
smiling
brightly
he
sighed
but
questioned
her
no
farther
a
while
ago
she
volunteered
i
had
neither
friends
nor
relatives
he
gave
her
a
queer
look
then
i
had
no
money
i
had
been
hurt
in
an
accident
and
was
almost
helpless
but
i
did
not
despair
sir
and
i
am
only
an
inexperienced
girl
in
my
darkest
hour
i
found
friends
kind
loving
friends
who
showed
me
a
new
world
that
i
had
not
suspected
was
in
existence
i
think
the
world
is
like
a
great
mirror
she
continued
meditatively
and
reflects
our
lives
just
as
we
ourselves
look
upon
it
those
who
turn
sad
faces
toward
the
world
find
only
sadness
reflected
but
a
smile
is
reflected
in
the
same
way
and
cheers
and
brightens
our
hearts
you
think
there
is
no
pleasure
to
be
had
in
life
that
is
because
you
are
heartsick
and
and
tired
as
you
say
with
one
sad
story
ended
you
are
afraid
to
begin
another
a
sequel
feeling
it
would
be
equally
sad
but
why
should
it
be
is
the
joy
or
sorrow
equally
divided
in
life
no
he
replied
a
few
days
ago
she
continued
earnestly
we
were
crossing
the
arizona
deserts
it
was
not
pleasant
but
we
did
not
despair
for
we
knew
the
world
is
not
all
desert
and
that
the
land
of
roses
and
sunshine
lay
just
beyond
now
that
we
in
california
we
forgotten
the
dreary
desert
but
you
why
sir
you
just
crossed
your
desert
and
you
believe
all
the
world
is
bitter
and
cruel
and
holds
no
joy
for
you
why
do
you
step
out
bravely
into
the
roses
and
sunshine
of
life
and
find
the
joy
that
has
been
denied
you
he
looked
into
her
eyes
almost
fearfully
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
his
own
held
a
first
glimmer
of
hope
do
you
believe
there
can
be
joy
for
me
anywhere
in
the
world
he
asked
of
course
i
tell
you
there
just
as
much
sweet
as
there
is
bitter
in
life
do
i
know
it
have
i
proved
it
but
happiness
chase
people
who
try
to
hide
from
it
it
will
meet
you
halfway
but
you
got
to
do
your
share
to
deserve
it
i
not
preaching
lived
this
all
out
in
my
own
experience
and
know
what
i
talking
about
now
as
for
you
sir
i
can
see
very
plainly
you
have
been
doing
your
duty
you
met
sorrow
and
let
it
conquer
you
taken
melancholy
by
the
hand
and
wo
let
go
of
it
you
have
tried
to
fight
for
your
rights
the
rights
god
gave
to
every
man
and
expects
him
to
hold
fast
to
and
take
advantage
of
no
indeed
but
what
is
the
use
he
asked
timidly
yet
with
an
eager
look
in
his
face
you
are
young
my
child
i
am
nearly
old
enough
to
have
been
your
father
there
are
things
you
have
not
yet
learned
things
i
hope
you
will
never
learn
an
oak
may
stand
alone
in
a
field
and
be
lonely
because
it
can
not
touch
boughs
with
another
a
flower
may
bloom
alone
in
a
garden
and
wither
and
die
for
want
of
companionship
wisdom
grouped
every
living
thing
he
gave
adam
a
comrade
he
created
no
solitary
thing
but
see
my
child
although
this
world
contains
countless
thousands
there
is
not
one
among
them
i
may
call
my
friend
oh
yes
just
one
said
myrtle
quickly
i
am
your
friend
not
because
you
want
me
but
because
you
need
me
and
that
a
beginning
is
it
i
can
find
other
friends
for
you
among
friends
and
you
will
be
sure
to
like
them
because
i
like
them
this
naive
suggestion
did
not
affect
him
as
much
as
the
fact
that
this
fair
young
girl
had
confessed
herself
his
friend
he
did
not
look
at
myrtle
now
he
stared
straight
ahead
at
the
wall
paper
and
his
brow
was
furrowed
as
if
he
was
thinking
deeply
perhaps
any
other
man
would
have
thanked
the
girl
for
her
sympathy
and
her
proffered
friendship
or
at
the
least
have
acknowledged
it
but
not
so
this
queer
jones
eccentric
indeed
as
the
shrewd
landlord
had
described
him
nor
did
myrtle
seem
to
expect
an
acknowledgment
it
was
enough
for
her
that
her
speech
had
set
him
thinking
along
new
lines
he
sat
musing
for
so
long
that
she
finally
remembered
it
was
growing
late
and
began
to
fear
patsy
and
beth
would
seek
their
rooms
which
connected
with
her
own
and
find
her
absent
that
would
worry
them
so
at
last
she
rose
softly
took
her
crutches
and
turned
to
go
good
night
my
friend
she
said
good
night
my
child
he
answered
in
a
mechanical
tone
without
rousing
from
his
abstraction
myrtle
went
to
her
room
and
found
it
was
not
so
late
as
she
had
feared
she
opened
a
drawer
and
placed
the
revolver
in
it
not
without
a
little
shudder
at
any
rate
she
murmured
with
satisfaction
he
will
not
use
this
chapter
xx
on
point
loma
next
morning
a
beautiful
bunch
of
roses
was
brought
to
room
roses
so
magnificent
that
it
seemed
impossible
they
could
be
grown
out
of
doors
but
there
are
few
hothouses
in
california
and
the
boy
who
brought
the
flowers
confided
to
her
the
information
that
they
were
selected
from
more
than
five
hundred
blooms
she
ran
to
show
them
to
patsy
and
beth
who
were
amazed
not
only
by
the
roses
but
by
the
fact
that
the
queer
jones
had
sent
them
to
myrtle
there
was
no
card
or
note
accompanying
the
gift
but
after
the
younger
girl
had
related
her
conversation
with
jones
the
previous
evening
they
could
not
doubt
but
he
had
sent
the
flowers
perhaps
reflected
patsy
we
been
misjudging
him
i
never
beheld
such
a
stolid
unimpressive
countenance
in
my
life
but
the
man
must
have
a
soul
of
some
sort
or
he
would
not
think
of
sending
flowers
to
his
new
friend
it
a
pretty
idea
said
beth
he
wanted
to
assure
myrtle
that
he
appreciated
her
kindness
i
sure
he
likes
me
declared
myrtle
simply
he
was
a
bit
cross
when
i
ran
in
and
took
away
his
pistol
or
when
i
preached
to
him
i
really
gave
him
a
good
talking
to
and
he
did
object
a
bit
what
he
needs
commented
beth
is
to
get
away
from
himself
and
mingle
with
people
more
i
wonder
if
we
could
coax
him
to
join
us
in
our
ride
to
point
loma
would
we
care
to
ask
him
said
patsy
he
as
sour
and
crabbed
in
looks
as
he
is
in
disposition
and
has
treated
uncle
john
advances
shamefully
i
like
to
help
myrtle
bring
the
old
fellow
back
to
life
but
perhaps
we
can
find
an
easier
way
than
to
shut
him
up
with
us
in
an
automobile
he
would
go
i
sure
declared
myrtle
he
has
mellowed
a
little
a
very
little
as
these
roses
prove
but
he
treated
me
last
night
just
as
he
does
merrick
even
after
our
conversation
when
i
said
night
i
had
to
wait
a
long
time
for
his
answer
but
like
you
to
meet
him
and
help
cheer
him
up
so
please
let
me
introduce
him
if
there
a
chance
and
do
be
nice
to
him
i
declare
cried
patsy
laughing
myrtle
has
assumed
an
air
of
proprietorship
over
the
sad
one
already
she
has
a
right
to
for
she
saved
his
life
said
beth
three
times
myrtle
added
proudly
he
told
me
so
himself
uncle
john
heard
the
story
of
myrtle
adventure
with
considerable
surprise
and
he
too
expressed
a
wish
to
aid
her
in
winning
jones
from
his
melancholy
mood
every
man
is
queer
in
one
way
or
another
said
he
and
i
say
the
women
were
too
if
you
females
were
not
listening
i
also
imagine
a
very
rich
man
has
the
right
to
be
eccentric
if
it
pleases
him
is
jones
rich
then
inquired
beth
according
to
the
landlord
he
rich
as
croesus
made
his
money
in
mining
manipulating
stocks
i
suppose
but
evidently
his
wealth
has
been
a
comfort
to
him
or
he
would
want
to
shuffle
off
his
mortal
coil
and
leave
it
behind
they
did
not
see
the
object
of
this
conversation
before
leaving
for
the
trip
to
point
loma
a
promontory
that
juts
out
far
into
the
pacific
it
is
reached
by
a
superb
macadamized
boulevard
which
passes
down
the
north
edge
of
the
promontory
rounds
the
corner
where
stands
the
lighthouse
and
comes
back
along
the
southern
edge
all
the
time
a
hundred
feet
or
more
in
elevation
above
the
ocean
the
view
from
the
point
is
unsurpassed
wampus
stopped
his
car
beside
a
handsomely
appointed
automobile
that
was
just
then
deserted
some
one
is
here
before
us
remarked
patsy
but
that
is
not
strange
the
wonder
is
that
crowds
are
not
here
perpetually
it
is
said
related
the
major
who
had
really
begun
to
enjoy
california
that
the
view
from
this
point
includes
more
varied
scenery
than
any
other
that
is
known
in
the
world
here
we
see
the
grand
san
bernardino
range
of
mountains
the
spanish
bight
on
the
mexican
shore
the
pretty
city
of
san
diego
climbing
its
hills
with
the
placid
bay
in
front
where
float
the
warships
of
the
pacific
squadron
the
broad
stretch
of
orange
and
lemon
groves
hedged
with
towering
palm
trees
santa
catalina
and
the
coronado
islands
the
blue
pacific
rolling
in
front
and
rugged
loma
with
its
rocky
cliffs
behind
what
more
could
we
ask
to
see
from
any
one
viewpoint
do
forget
the
monster
hotel
with
its
hundred
towers
and
gables
dominating
the
strip
of
land
between
the
bay
and
the
ocean
added
beth
how
near
it
seems
and
yet
it
is
many
miles
away
some
one
had
told
them
that
moonstones
were
to
be
found
on
the
beach
at
the
base
of
the
cliff
so
they
all
climbed
down
the
steep
path
followed
by
mumbles
who
had
not
perceptibly
grown
in
size
during
the
trip
but
had
acquired
an
adventurous
disposition
which
coupled
with
his
native
inquisitiveness
frequently
led
him
into
trouble
now
when
they
had
reached
the
narrow
beach
mumbles
ran
ahead
passed
around
the
corner
of
a
cliff
that
almost
touched
the
water
and
was
presently
heard
barking
furiously
sounds
as
if
he
scented
game
said
patsy
a
turtle
perhaps
or
a
big
fish
washed
ashore
suggested
the
major
but
now
the
small
dog
voice
changed
suddenly
and
became
a
succession
of
yelps
expressing
mingled
pain
and
terror
oh
he
hurt
cried
myrtle
and
they
all
hurried
forward
uncle
john
leading
them
on
a
run
and
passed
around
the
big
rock
to
rescue
their
pet
some
one
was
before
them
however
the
foolish
dog
had
found
a
huge
crab
in
the
sand
and
barking
loudly
had
pushed
his
muzzle
against
the
creature
with
the
result
that
the
crab
seized
his
black
nose
in
a
gripping
claw
and
pinched
as
hard
as
it
was
able
mumbles
tried
to
back
away
madly
howling
the
while
but
the
crab
although
the
smaller
antagonist
gripped
a
rock
with
its
other
claw
and
held
on
anchoring
the
terrified
dog
to
the
spot
but
help
was
at
hand
a
tall
thin
man
hurried
to
the
rescue
and
just
as
uncle
john
came
in
sight
leading
his
procession
a
knife
severed
the
crab
claw
and
mumbles
was
free
seeing
his
mistress
the
puppy
still
whining
with
pain
hurried
to
her
for
comfort
while
uncle
john
turned
to
the
man
and
said
thank
you
jones
for
assisting
our
poor
beast
mumbles
is
an
eastern
dog
you
know
and
inexperienced
in
dealing
with
crabs
jones
was
examining
the
claw
the
despoiled
owner
of
which
had
quickly
slid
into
the
water
it
is
a
species
of
crawfish
he
observed
meditatively
then
seeing
the
girls
approach
he
straightened
up
and
rather
awkwardly
lifted
his
hat
the
gesture
surprised
them
all
heretofore
when
they
had
met
the
man
had
merely
stared
and
turned
away
now
his
attempt
at
courtesy
was
startling
because
unexpected
myrtle
came
close
to
his
side
how
nice
to
find
you
here
jones
she
said
brightly
and
oh
i
must
thank
you
for
my
lovely
roses
he
watched
her
face
with
evident
interest
and
it
seemed
that
his
own
countenance
had
become
less
haggard
and
sad
than
formerly
let
me
introduce
my
friends
said
the
girl
with
sudden
recollection
of
her
duty
this
is
merrick
my
good
friend
and
benefactor
and
this
is
major
doyle
and
his
daughter
miss
patricia
doyle
both
of
whom
have
the
kindest
hearts
in
the
world
miss
beth
de
graf
niece
has
watched
over
and
cared
for
me
like
a
sister
and
oh
i
forgot
miss
patsy
is
merrick
niece
too
so
now
you
know
them
all
the
man
nodded
briefly
his
acknowledgment
you
you
are
jones
i
believe
of
of
boston
once
of
boston
he
repeated
mechanically
then
he
looked
at
her
and
added
go
on
why
what
i
do
understand
she
faltered
have
i
overlooked
anyone
only
yourself
he
said
oh
but
i
i
met
you
last
night
you
did
not
tell
me
your
name
he
reminded
her
i
myrtle
she
replied
smiling
in
her
relief
myrtle
dean
myrtle
dean
his
voice
was
harsh
almost
a
shout
myrtle
dean
and
i
i
from
chicago
but
i
do
live
there
any
more
he
stood
motionless
looking
at
the
girl
with
a
fixed
expression
that
embarrassed
her
and
caused
her
to
glance
appealingly
at
patsy
her
friend
understood
and
came
to
her
rescue
with
some
inconsequent
remark
about
poor
mumbles
who
was
still
moaning
and
rubbing
his
pinched
nose
against
patsy
chin
to
ease
the
pain
jones
paid
little
heed
to
miss
doyle
observation
but
as
myrtle
tried
to
hide
behind
beth
merrick
took
the
situation
in
hand
by
drawing
the
man
attention
to
the
scenery
and
afterward
inquiring
if
he
was
searching
for
moonstones
the
conversation
now
became
general
except
that
jones
remained
practically
silent
he
seemed
to
try
to
interest
himself
in
the
chatter
around
him
but
always
his
eyes
would
stray
to
myrtle
face
and
hold
her
until
she
found
an
opportunity
to
turn
away
we
luncheon
in
the
car
announced
uncle
john
after
a
time
wo
you
join
us
mr
jones
yes
was
the
unconventional
reply
the
man
was
undoubtedly
abstracted
and
did
not
know
he
was
rude
he
quietly
followed
them
up
the
rocks
and
when
they
reached
the
automobile
remained
by
side
while
wampus
brought
out
the
lunch
basket
and
beth
and
patsy
spread
the
cloth
upon
the
grass
and
unpacked
the
hamper
jones
ate
merely
a
mouthful
but
he
evidently
endeavored
to
follow
the
conversation
and
take
an
interest
in
what
was
said
he
finally
became
conscious
that
his
continuous
gaze
distressed
myrtle
and
thereafter
strove
to
keep
his
eyes
from
her
face
they
would
creep
back
to
it
from
time
to
time
but
beth
who
was
watching
him
curiously
concluded
he
was
making
a
serious
effort
to
deport
himself
agreeably
and
credited
him
with
a
decided
improvement
in
manners
as
their
acquaintance
with
him
progressed
after
luncheon
when
their
return
by
way
of
old
town
and
the
spanish
mission
was
proposed
jones
said
pointing
to
the
car
that
stood
beside
their
own
this
is
my
automobile
i
drive
it
myself
i
would
like
myrtle
dean
to
ride
back
with
me
the
girl
hesitated
but
quickly
deciding
she
must
not
retreat
now
she
had
practically
begun
the
misanthrope
reformation
she
replied
i
will
be
very
glad
to
but
wo
you
take
one
of
my
friends
also
that
will
divide
the
party
more
evenly
he
looked
down
at
his
feet
thoughtfully
considering
the
proposition
i
go
with
you
said
beth
promptly
get
into
the
front
seat
with
jones
myrtle
and
i
ride
behind
the
man
made
no
protest
he
merely
lifted
myrtle
in
his
arms
and
gently
placed
her
in
the
front
seat
beth
much
amused
took
the
seat
behind
unassisted
save
that
the
major
opened
the
door
for
her
jones
evidently
understood
his
car
starting
the
engines
without
effort
he
took
his
place
at
the
wheel
and
with
a
nod
to
merrick
said
lead
on
sir
i
will
follow
wampus
started
away
he
was
displeased
with
the
other
car
it
did
not
suit
him
at
all
and
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
individual
who
owned
it
had
taken
away
two
of
wampus
own
passengers
the
small
shaggy
mumbles
who
had
been
the
established
companion
of
uncle
john
chauffeur
throughout
all
the
long
journey
suddenly
deserted
him
he
whined
to
go
with
the
other
car
and
when
patsy
lifted
him
aboard
he
curled
down
beside
the
stranger
as
if
thoroughly
satisfied
patsy
knew
why
and
was
amused
that
mumbles
showed
his
gratitude
to
jones
for
rescuing
him
from
the
crab
but
wampus
scowled
and
was
distinctly
unhappy
all
the
way
to
old
town
him
mebbe
fine
gentleman
muttered
the
canadian
to
the
major
but
if
so
he
make
a
disguise
of
it
once
i
knew
a
dog
thief
who
resemble
him
but
perhaps
mumble
he
safe
as
long
as
miss
myrtle
an
miss
beth
they
with
him
do
worry
said
the
major
consolingly
i
keep
my
eye
on
the
rascal
but
he
a
fine
driver
is
he
oh
retorted
wampus
scornfully
such
little
cheap
car
like
that
he
drive
himself
at
old
town
jones
left
them
saying
he
had
been
to
the
mission
and
did
not
care
for
it
but
as
he
drove
his
car
away
there
was
a
gentler
and
more
kindly
expression
upon
his
features
than
any
of
them
had
ever
seen
there
before
and
myrtle
suspected
her
charm
was
working
and
the
regeneration
really
begun
chapter
xxi
a
tale
of
woe
that
evening
after
dinner
as
merrick
sat
alone
in
the
hotel
lobby
the
girls
having
gone
to
watch
the
major
bowl
tenpins
jones
approached
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
beside
him
uncle
john
greeted
the
man
with
an
attempt
at
cordiality
he
could
not
yet
bring
himself
to
like
his
personality
but
on
myrtle
account
and
because
he
was
himself
generous
enough
to
wish
to
be
of
service
to
anyone
so
forlorn
and
unhappy
he
treated
jones
with
more
respect
than
he
really
thought
he
deserved
tell
me
merrick
was
the
abrupt
request
where
you
found
myrtle
dean
uncle
john
told
him
willingly
there
was
no
doubt
but
myrtle
had
interested
the
man
my
girls
found
her
on
the
train
between
chicago
and
denver
he
began
she
was
on
her
way
to
join
her
uncle
in
leadville
what
is
her
uncle
name
anson
jones
but
the
child
was
almost
helpless
ill
and
without
friends
or
money
she
was
not
at
all
sure
her
uncle
was
still
in
leadville
in
which
case
she
would
be
at
the
mercy
of
a
cold
world
so
i
telegraphed
and
found
that
anson
jones
had
been
gone
from
the
mining
camp
for
several
months
do
you
know
sir
i
at
first
suspected
you
might
be
the
missing
uncle
for
i
heard
you
were
a
miner
and
found
that
your
name
is
jones
but
i
soon
discovered
you
are
not
anson
jones
but
jones
which
alters
the
case
considerably
jones
nodded
absently
tell
me
the
rest
he
said
uncle
john
complied
he
related
the
manner
in
which
beth
and
patsy
had
adopted
myrtle
the
physician
examination
and
report
upon
her
condition
and
then
told
the
main
points
of
their
long
but
delightful
journey
from
albuquerque
to
san
diego
in
the
limousine
it
was
one
of
the
most
fortunate
experiments
we
have
ever
tried
he
concluded
for
the
child
has
been
the
sweetest
and
most
agreeable
companion
imaginable
and
her
affection
and
gratitude
have
amply
repaid
us
for
anything
we
have
done
for
her
i
am
determined
she
shall
not
leave
us
sir
when
we
return
to
new
york
i
shall
consult
the
best
specialist
to
be
had
and
i
am
confident
she
can
be
fully
cured
and
made
as
good
as
new
the
other
man
had
listened
intently
and
when
the
story
was
finished
he
sat
silent
for
a
time
as
if
considering
and
pondering
over
what
he
had
heard
then
without
warning
he
announced
quietly
i
am
anson
jones
uncle
john
fairly
gasped
for
breath
anson
jones
he
exclaimed
then
with
plausible
suspicion
he
added
i
myself
saw
that
you
are
registered
as
jones
it
is
the
same
thing
was
the
reply
my
name
is
collanson
but
my
family
always
called
me
when
i
had
a
family
and
by
that
name
i
was
best
known
in
the
mining
camps
that
is
what
deceived
you
but
dear
me
i
do
believe
myrtle
knows
her
uncle
name
is
collanson
probably
not
her
mother
sir
my
sister
was
my
only
remaining
relative
the
only
person
on
earth
who
cared
for
me
although
i
foolishly
believed
another
did
i
worked
for
success
as
much
on
kitty
account
kitty
was
myrtle
mother
as
for
my
own
sake
i
intended
some
day
to
make
her
comfortable
and
happy
for
i
knew
her
husband
death
had
left
her
poor
and
friendless
i
did
not
see
her
for
years
nor
write
to
her
often
it
was
not
my
way
but
kitty
always
knew
i
loved
her
he
paused
and
sat
silent
a
moment
then
he
resumed
in
his
quiet
even
tones
there
is
another
part
of
my
story
that
you
must
know
to
understand
me
fully
to
know
why
i
am
now
a
hopeless
desperate
man
or
was
until
until
last
night
perhaps
some
years
ago
when
in
boston
i
fell
in
love
with
a
beautiful
girl
i
am
nearly
fifty
and
she
was
not
quite
thirty
but
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
i
was
too
old
to
win
her
love
and
she
frankly
confessed
she
cared
for
me
but
she
said
she
could
not
marry
a
poor
man
and
would
therefore
wait
for
me
to
make
a
fortune
then
i
might
be
sure
she
would
marry
me
i
believed
her
i
do
not
know
why
men
believe
women
it
is
an
absurd
thing
to
do
i
did
it
but
other
men
have
been
guilty
of
a
like
folly
ah
how
i
worked
and
planned
one
can
not
always
make
a
fortune
in
a
short
time
it
took
me
years
and
all
the
time
she
renewed
her
promises
and
kept
my
hopes
and
my
ambitions
alive
at
last
i
won
the
game
as
i
knew
i
should
do
in
time
it
was
a
big
strike
i
discovered
the
bonnet
mine
and
sold
a
half
interest
in
it
for
a
million
then
i
hurried
to
boston
to
claim
my
bride
she
had
been
married
just
three
months
after
waiting
or
pretending
to
wait
for
me
for
nearly
ten
years
she
married
a
poor
lawyer
too
after
persistently
refusing
me
because
was
poor
she
laughed
at
my
despair
and
coldly
advised
me
to
find
some
one
else
to
share
my
fortune
he
paused
again
and
wearily
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
a
familiar
gesture
as
myrtle
knew
his
voice
had
grown
more
and
more
dismal
as
he
proceeded
and
just
now
he
seemed
as
desolate
and
unhappy
as
when
first
they
saw
him
at
the
grand
canyon
i
lived
through
it
somehow
he
continued
but
the
blow
stunned
me
it
stuns
me
yet
like
a
wounded
beast
i
slunk
away
to
find
my
sister
knowing
she
would
try
to
comfort
me
she
was
dead
her
daughter
myrtle
whom
i
had
never
seen
had
been
killed
in
an
automobile
accident
that
is
what
her
aunt
a
terrible
woman
named
martha
dean
told
me
although
now
i
know
it
was
a
lie
told
to
cover
her
own
baseness
in
sending
an
unprotected
child
to
the
far
west
to
seek
an
unknown
uncle
i
paid
martha
dean
back
the
money
she
claimed
she
had
spent
for
myrtle
funeral
that
was
mere
robbery
i
suppose
but
not
to
be
compared
with
the
crime
of
her
false
report
i
found
myself
bereft
of
sweetheart
sister
even
an
unknown
niece
despair
claimed
me
i
took
the
first
train
for
the
west
dazed
and
utterly
despondent
some
impulse
led
me
to
stop
off
at
the
grand
canyon
and
there
i
saw
the
means
of
ending
all
my
misery
but
myrtle
interfered
uncle
john
now
thoroughly
interested
and
sympathetic
leaned
over
and
said
solemnly
the
hand
of
god
was
in
that
jones
nodded
i
am
beginning
to
believe
it
he
replied
the
girl
face
won
me
even
in
that
despairing
mood
she
has
kitty
eyes
they
are
beautiful
eyes
said
uncle
john
earnestly
sir
you
have
found
in
your
niece
one
of
the
sweetest
and
most
lovely
girls
that
ever
lived
i
congratulate
you
jones
nodded
again
his
mood
had
changed
again
since
they
began
to
speak
of
myrtle
his
eyes
now
glowed
with
pleasure
and
pride
he
clasped
merrick
hand
in
his
own
as
he
said
with
feeling
she
has
saved
me
sir
even
before
i
knew
she
was
my
niece
i
began
to
wonder
if
it
would
not
pay
me
to
live
for
her
sake
and
now
and
now
you
are
sure
of
it
cried
uncle
john
emphatically
but
who
is
to
break
the
news
to
myrtle
no
one
just
yet
was
the
reply
allow
me
sir
if
you
please
to
keep
her
in
ignorance
of
the
truth
a
little
longer
i
only
made
the
discovery
myself
today
you
see
and
i
need
time
to
think
it
all
out
and
determine
how
best
to
take
advantage
of
my
good
fortune
i
shall
respect
your
wish
sir
said
merrick
the
girls
came
trooping
back
then
and
instead
of
running
away
anson
jones
remained
to
talk
with
them
beth
and
patsy
were
really
surprised
to
find
the
sad
one
chatting
pleasantly
with
uncle
john
the
major
looked
at
the
man
curiously
not
understanding
the
change
in
him
but
myrtle
was
quite
proud
of
the
progress
he
was
making
and
his
improved
spirits
rendered
the
girl
very
happy
indeed
why
she
should
take
such
an
interest
in
this
man
she
could
not
have
explained
except
that
he
had
been
discouraged
and
hopeless
and
she
had
succeeded
in
preventing
him
from
destroying
his
life
and
given
him
courage
to
face
the
world
anew
but
surely
that
was
enough
quite
sufficient
to
give
her
a
feeling
of
proprietorship
as
patsy
had
expressed
it
in
this
queer
personage
aside
from
all
this
she
was
growing
to
like
the
man
who
owed
so
much
to
her
neither
patsy
nor
beth
could
yet
see
much
to
interest
them
or
to
admire
in
his
gloomy
character
but
myrtle
intuition
led
her
to
see
beneath
the
surface
and
she
knew
there
were
lovable
traits
in
jones
nature
if
he
could
only
be
induced
to
display
them
chapter
xxii
the
confession
after
that
evening
the
man
attached
himself
to
the
party
on
every
possible
occasion
sometimes
in
their
trips
around
coronado
he
rode
in
their
automobile
at
other
times
he
took
myrtle
and
perhaps
one
other
in
his
own
car
every
day
he
seemed
brighter
and
more
cheerful
until
even
major
doyle
admitted
he
was
not
a
bad
companion
three
weeks
later
they
moved
up
to
los
angeles
taking
two
days
for
the
trip
and
stopping
at
riverside
and
redlands
on
the
way
they
established
their
headquarters
at
one
of
the
handsome
los
angeles
hotels
and
from
there
made
little
journeys
through
the
surrounding
country
the
garden
spot
of
southern
california
one
day
they
went
to
pasadena
which
boasts
more
splendid
residences
than
any
city
of
its
size
in
the
world
at
another
time
they
visited
hollywood
famed
as
the
paradise
of
flowers
both
mountains
and
sea
were
within
easy
reach
and
there
was
so
much
to
do
that
the
time
passed
all
too
swiftly
it
was
on
their
return
from
such
a
day
outing
that
myrtle
met
with
her
life
greatest
surprise
indeed
the
surprise
was
shared
by
all
but
uncle
john
who
had
religiously
kept
the
secret
of
identity
as
they
reached
the
hotel
this
eventful
evening
merrick
said
to
the
girls
after
you
have
dressed
for
dinner
meet
us
on
the
parlor
floor
we
dine
privately
they
were
mildly
astonished
at
the
request
but
as
uncle
john
was
always
doing
some
unusual
thing
they
gave
the
matter
little
thought
however
on
reaching
the
parlor
floor
an
hour
later
they
found
merrick
the
major
and
jones
in
a
group
awaiting
them
and
all
were
garbed
in
their
dress
suits
with
rare
flowers
in
their
buttonholes
what
is
it
then
asked
patsy
a
treat
i
think
so
said
uncle
john
smiling
your
arm
please
miss
doyle
the
major
escorted
beth
and
jones
walked
solemnly
beside
myrtle
who
still
used
crutches
but
more
as
a
matter
of
convenience
than
because
they
were
necessary
at
the
end
of
a
corridor
a
waiter
threw
open
the
door
of
a
small
but
beautiful
banquet
room
where
a
round
table
glistening
with
cut
glass
and
silver
was
set
for
six
in
the
center
of
the
table
was
a
handsome
centerpiece
decorated
with
vines
of
myrtle
while
the
entire
room
was
filled
with
sprays
of
the
dainty
vines
alive
with
their
pretty
blue
flowers
goodness
me
exclaimed
patsy
laughing
gleefully
this
seems
to
be
our
little
myrtle
especial
spread
who
is
the
host
uncle
john
jones
of
course
announced
beth
promptly
myrtle
blushed
and
glanced
shyly
at
jones
his
face
was
fairly
illumined
with
pleasure
he
placed
her
in
the
seat
of
honor
and
said
gravely
this
is
indeed
myrtle
entertainment
for
she
has
found
something
it
is
also
partly
my
own
thanksgiving
banquet
my
friends
for
i
too
have
found
something
his
tone
was
so
serious
that
all
remained
silent
as
they
took
their
seats
and
during
the
many
courses
served
the
conversation
was
less
lively
than
on
former
occasions
when
there
had
been
no
ceremony
myrtle
tried
hard
to
eat
but
there
was
a
question
in
her
eyes
a
question
that
occupied
her
all
through
the
meal
when
finally
the
dessert
was
served
and
the
servants
had
withdrawn
and
left
them
to
themselves
the
girl
could
restrain
her
curiosity
no
longer
tell
me
jones
she
said
turning
to
him
as
he
sat
beside
her
what
have
you
found
he
was
deliberate
as
ever
in
answering
you
must
not
call
me
jones
hereafter
said
he
why
not
then
what
i
call
you
she
returned
greatly
perplexed
i
think
it
would
be
more
appropriate
for
you
to
call
me
anson
uncle
anson
why
uncle
anson
is
is
she
paused
utterly
bewildered
but
with
a
sudden
suspicion
that
made
her
head
whirl
it
strikes
me
myrtle
said
uncle
john
cheerfully
that
you
have
never
been
properly
introduced
to
jones
if
i
remember
aright
you
scraped
acquaintance
with
him
and
had
no
regular
introduction
so
i
will
now
perform
that
agreeable
office
miss
myrtle
dean
allow
me
to
present
your
uncle
collanson
b
jones
collanson
repeated
all
the
girls
in
an
astonished
chorus
that
is
my
name
said
jones
the
first
smile
they
had
seen
radiating
his
grim
countenance
all
the
folks
at
home
among
them
my
sister
kitty
your
mother
my
dear
called
me
and
that
is
why
i
suppose
old
martha
dean
knew
me
only
as
your
anson
had
she
told
you
my
name
was
collanson
you
might
have
suspected
earlier
that
jones
was
your
lost
uncle
lost
only
because
he
was
unable
to
find
you
myrtle
while
you
were
journeying
west
in
search
of
him
he
was
journeying
east
but
i
glad
for
many
reasons
that
you
did
not
know
me
it
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
learn
the
sweetness
of
your
character
now
i
sincerely
thank
god
that
he
led
you
to
me
to
reclaim
me
and
give
me
something
to
live
for
if
you
will
permit
me
my
dear
niece
i
will
hereafter
devote
my
whole
life
to
you
and
earnestly
try
to
promote
your
happiness
during
this
long
speech
myrtle
had
sat
wide
eyed
and
white
watching
his
face
and
marveling
at
the
strangeness
of
her
fate
but
she
was
very
very
glad
and
young
enough
to
quickly
recover
from
the
shock
there
was
a
round
of
applause
from
patsy
beth
the
major
and
uncle
john
which
served
admirably
to
cover
their
little
embarrassment
and
give
her
time
to
partially
collect
herself
then
she
turned
to
jones
and
with
eyes
swimming
with
tears
tenderly
kissed
his
furrowed
cheek
oh
uncle
anson
i
happy
she
said
of
course
myrtle
story
is
told
now
but
it
may
be
well
to
add
that
uncle
anson
did
for
her
all
that
uncle
john
had
intended
doing
and
even
more
the
consultation
with
a
famous
new
york
specialist
on
their
return
a
month
later
assured
the
girl
that
no
painful
operation
was
necessary
the
splendid
outing
she
had
enjoyed
with
the
fine
air
of
the
far
west
had
built
up
her
health
to
such
an
extent
that
nature
remedied
the
ill
she
had
suffered
myrtle
took
no
crutches
back
to
new
york
a
city
now
visited
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
nor
did
she
ever
need
them
again
the
slight
limp
she
now
has
will
disappear
in
time
the
doctors
say
and
the
child
is
so
radiantly
happy
that
neither
she
nor
her
friends
notice
the
limp
at
all
patsy
doyle
as
owner
of
the
pretty
flat
building
on
willing
square
has
rented
to
uncle
anson
the
apartment
just
opposite
that
of
the
doyles
and
jones
has
furnished
it
cosily
to
make
a
home
for
his
niece
to
whom
he
is
so
devoted
that
patsy
declares
her
own
doting
and
adoring
father
is
fairly
outclassed
the
major
asserts
this
is
absurd
but
he
has
acquired
a
genuine
friendship
for
anson
jones
who
is
no
longer
sad
but
has
grown
lovable
under
myrtle
beneficent
influence
