the

flight
or

roundup
chapter
i
the
boy
fliers
it
was
my
mistake
frank
how
do
you
make
that
out
andy
simply
because
i
was
using
the
little
patent
bird
last
in
our
shop
and
should
have
put
it
back
in
the
toolbox
belonging
to
the
aeroplane
the
fact
that
it
is
here
shows
that
i
mislaid
it
give
me
a
bad
mark
frank
well
i
must
say
it
a
queer
stunt
for
you
to
forget
anything
andy
bird
but
with
dark
coming
along
and
home
some
miles
away
it
plain
that
we
have
to
let
the
mending
of
that
wing
go
till
morning
but
do
you
think
frank
it
just
safe
to
leave
our
pet
hydroplane
over
night
in
this
field
on
the
quackenboss
farm
why
not
andy
sky
as
clear
as
a
bell
little
or
no
wind
promised
and
then
we
can
hire
the
farm
hand
felix
boggs
to
keep
an
eye
on
it
looks
as
easy
as
falling
off
a
log
and
all
because
i
did
put
that
little
wrench
where
it
belonged
kick
me
wo
you
please
cousin
i
deserve
it
well
i
guess
not
did
i
make
just
as
bad
a
break
last
week
i
guess
now
no
boy
perfect
and
i
do
mind
the
walk
home
a
bit
fact
is
it
ought
to
do
us
both
good
because
we
do
stretch
our
legs
enough
as
it
is
you
the
boss
chum
frank
then
you
another
see
what
you
get
for
calling
me
names
but
when
you
fastened
down
that
plane
so
it
ca
get
into
trouble
if
the
wind
should
rise
in
the
night
perhaps
we
better
be
hunting
up
this
felix
boggs
and
then
start
for
home
well
i
glad
we
get
there
in
the
frank
even
if
the
moon
does
happen
to
be
nearly
full
what
makes
you
say
that
andy
because
when
an
aviator
leaves
his
wounded
machine
in
a
field
and
walks
home
it
makes
him
feel
like
a
dog
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
sneaking
along
back
of
the
fences
frank
bird
laughed
merrily
at
the
picture
drawn
by
his
cousin
and
then
stooping
again
with
a
few
deft
turns
of
a
heavy
cord
helped
andy
secure
the
broken
plane
so
it
would
not
get
into
trouble
during
the
coming
night
after
which
the
two
boys
headed
toward
the
barns
belonging
to
the
farm
which
just
showed
their
tops
above
the
adjacent
rise
while
they
are
walking
there
it
may
be
a
good
time
for
us
to
introduce
the
pair
of
young
aviators
to
such
readers
as
have
not
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
them
in
previous
volumes
of
this
series
of
stories
the
cousins
lived
in
the
town
of
bloomsbury
a
thriving
place
situated
on
the
southern
shore
of
sunrise
lake
which
was
a
magnificent
body
of
water
said
to
be
nearly
seventeen
miles
long
by
three
wide
in
places
this
lake
having
hilly
shores
that
were
heavily
wooded
in
spots
and
with
numerous
fine
coves
afforded
grand
sport
to
the
young
people
of
bloomsbury
both
winter
and
summer
the
railroad
skirted
one
shore
and
then
passed
through
the
town
some
miles
off
arose
a
lofty
peak
known
as
old
thundertop
which
had
a
road
running
part
way
up
its
side
the
summit
was
believed
to
be
utterly
inaccessible
to
mortal
man
until
one
day
the
bird
boys
managed
to
accomplish
the
wonderful
feat
by
the
aid
of
their
aeroplane
they
had
been
spending
all
their
spare
time
when
not
in
school
working
upon
the
line
that
seemed
to
have
a
strange
fascination
for
them
frank
father
was
one
of
the
best
known
doctors
in
town
a
man
of
considerable
means
and
with
a
firm
faith
in
his
boys
so
that
he
was
easily
convinced
whenever
frank
wished
to
do
anything
andy
had
been
living
with
his
guardian
for
some
time
until
the
return
of
his
own
father
professor
bird
who
had
been
lost
while
attempting
a
difficult
balloon
trip
in
central
america
and
found
in
a
most
miraculous
way
by
the
two
boys
as
told
in
a
previous
story
andy
had
inherited
the
passion
which
his
father
a
noted
professor
had
always
had
for
navigating
the
air
it
was
a
favorite
expression
of
his
a
bird
by
any
other
name
would
fly
as
high
and
his
cousin
would
retort
a
bird
takes
to
the
air
just
as
naturally
as
a
duck
does
to
water
they
had
been
doing
some
fine
stunts
during
the
last
year
or
two
and
it
may
be
supposed
that
the
people
of
bloomsbury
were
more
than
a
little
proud
of
seeing
the
name
of
their
town
mentioned
so
favorably
in
the
papers
in
connection
with
the
doings
of
the
bird
boys
of
course
as
is
always
the
case
there
was
a
rival
in
the
field
who
had
been
the
cause
of
much
trouble
in
the
past
and
still
watched
their
work
with
an
envious
eye
this
was
a
boy
by
the
name
of
percy
shelley
carberry
rather
a
bold
fellow
too
and
as
smart
as
they
make
them
only
unscrupulous
as
to
the
means
he
employed
by
which
to
gain
his
ends
percy
was
the
only
son
of
a
rich
widow
who
could
never
refuse
him
anything
he
demanded
and
with
unlimited
cash
at
his
disposal
he
had
been
able
to
do
quite
a
few
feats
himself
that
might
have
gained
him
more
or
less
fame
only
that
they
were
eclipsed
by
the
accomplishments
of
frank
and
andy
and
that
was
where
the
shoe
pinched
with
percy
his
temper
was
one
of
his
weak
spots
also
a
liking
for
fast
life
which
of
course
included
tippling
and
the
aviator
who
indulges
to
the
slightest
degree
in
strong
drink
is
next
door
to
a
fool
for
as
he
takes
his
life
in
his
hands
every
time
he
leaves
the
ground
the
necessity
for
a
clear
brain
is
apparent
in
most
of
his
tricky
work
young
carberry
had
for
a
boon
companion
one
sandy
hollingshead
a
sinewy
chap
whose
most
prominent
trait
was
his
faculty
for
disappearing
suddenly
in
a
pinch
he
was
considerable
of
a
boaster
but
could
always
invent
a
most
remarkable
excuse
for
going
before
the
storm
broke
but
percy
no
coward
himself
knew
how
to
make
use
of
his
sly
crony
and
despite
their
numerous
quarrels
that
often
ended
in
actual
fights
the
pair
of
precious
tricksters
still
kept
company
together
sandy
was
freckled
had
pale
eyes
and
very
blonde
hair
that
gave
him
a
queer
look
those
eyes
never
could
look
any
one
straight
in
the
face
but
shifted
uneasily
and
other
boys
said
that
sandy
the
cigarette
smoker
was
always
on
the
watch
for
a
quick
getaway
the
bird
boys
of
course
had
many
friends
among
the
lads
of
bloomsbury
but
only
two
who
were
close
enough
to
be
admitted
freely
to
the
workshop
on
the
grounds
of
frank
father
place
where
the
young
inventors
worked
out
many
of
their
lofty
ideas
these
were
larry
geohegan
and
a
small
runt
who
had
been
called
elephant
by
his
companions
in
a
spirit
of
sport
and
could
not
shake
the
name
his
full
name
was
fenimore
cooper
small
and
as
a
rule
he
had
always
been
rather
timid
but
elephant
was
always
having
queer
ideas
in
which
he
believed
fully
himself
but
which
were
nearly
always
jeered
at
by
more
practical
larry
the
two
bird
boys
had
been
out
on
this
afternoon
trying
some
new
arrangement
in
connection
with
their
hydroplane
when
they
met
with
an
accident
when
attempting
to
land
on
the
quackenboss
farm
to
make
some
changes
they
saw
were
needed
to
improve
the
working
of
the
machine
neither
of
them
had
been
even
scratched
but
a
certain
amount
of
damage
had
befallen
one
of
the
planes
which
might
have
been
remedied
on
the
spot
in
time
to
allow
them
to
get
back
home
easily
only
for
the
unfortunate
fact
that
just
when
they
needed
a
monkey
wrench
the
worst
kind
it
was
discovered
to
be
missing
perhaps
the
only
occasion
when
such
a
thing
had
happened
with
the
boys
i
just
saw
somebody
go
into
the
barn
there
remarked
frank
as
they
approached
the
large
outbuildings
connected
with
the
successful
farm
of
josiah
quackenboss
yes
and
it
was
the
farmer
himself
added
andy
i
know
him
pretty
well
and
i
guess
you
do
too
because
your
father
brought
his
little
boy
around
when
everybody
thought
he
did
have
a
single
chance
to
get
well
i
do
believe
we
have
any
trouble
getting
felix
boggs
to
look
after
our
machine
tonight
frank
they
quickly
reached
the
door
of
the
barn
and
could
hear
the
steady
fall
of
the
streams
of
milk
passing
into
the
buckets
as
the
farmer
and
his
hired
hand
pursued
the
regular
business
of
the
evening
as
the
two
boys
entered
the
half
grown
boy
started
up
with
an
exclamation
of
alarm
for
of
course
both
andy
and
frank
looked
rather
queer
each
of
them
had
on
a
white
woolen
hood
that
fitted
close
to
head
and
shoulders
for
the
air
in
the
upper
currents
was
very
cold
these
days
and
secured
to
this
were
goggles
to
protect
the
eyes
so
that
they
would
not
water
and
dim
the
vision
of
the
aviator
at
just
a
critical
instant
when
they
needed
clear
sight
then
they
also
wore
warm
colored
mackinaw
jackets
so
that
altogether
felix
had
reason
to
be
startled
when
two
such
sights
suddenly
entered
the
barn
why
even
the
gentle
cows
showed
evidence
of
nervousness
and
came
near
upsetting
the
milk
buckets
hello
mr
quackenboss
called
out
andy
cheerfully
we
the
bird
boys
and
we
dropped
in
on
you
without
an
invitation
the
fact
is
we
had
a
little
trouble
with
our
aeroplane
and
landed
in
your
field
how
much
rent
will
you
charge
us
quackenboss
to
let
our
machine
lie
there
over
night
it
needs
a
little
fixing
which
we
ca
do
until
morning
of
course
andy
was
joking
when
he
said
this
and
the
farmer
knew
it
as
well
as
anything
he
laughed
as
he
came
around
out
of
the
stall
and
offered
his
rough
hand
to
each
of
the
boys
how
are
you
andy
and
frank
bird
he
said
hearty
say
you
did
give
us
a
little
start
when
we
first
saw
you
d
know
what
i
thought
boys
why
i
was
just
reading
in
the
county
paper
about
how
the
bank
up
at
jasper
was
robbed
by
two
men
last
week
it
told
how
they
had
their
faces
hid
back
of
red
handkerchiefs
just
like
they
always
do
out
west
you
know
and
first
thing
i
sighted
you
two
my
heart
nigh
about
jumped
up
in
my
mought
because
i
thought
them
yeggs
had
dropped
around
to
see
if
i
collected
my
monthly
milk
accounts
in
town
and
about
leavin
your
aeroplane
in
my
field
why
there
little
that
i
would
do
for
the
son
of
the
man
who
saved
my
billie
when
everybody
said
he
never
get
well
again
we
thought
you
might
let
us
show
felix
here
where
the
aeroplane
lies
and
that
we
could
arrange
with
him
to
kind
of
keep
an
eye
on
it
tonight
of
course
there
is
one
chance
in
a
thousand
that
anything
happen
to
injure
it
but
then
that
machine
represents
a
heap
of
hard
work
and
considerable
money
besides
so
we
do
care
to
take
chances
with
it
sure
he
can
just
as
well
as
not
eh
felix
suppose
you
go
out
right
now
and
i
finish
the
milking
in
the
morning
i
want
to
take
a
look
at
that
contraption
myself
i
seen
you
boys
sailing
around
more
a
little
but
never
got
close
up
to
examine
the
aeroplane
well
i
guess
all
the
money
going
could
tempt
me
to
go
with
one
of
you
skip
along
felix
now
and
the
farm
hand
a
boy
eagerly
fell
in
behind
frank
and
andy
as
after
thanking
quackenboss
heartily
for
his
kindness
they
passed
out
of
the
barn
felix
considered
this
an
event
in
the
tame
routine
of
farm
life
and
would
be
only
too
glad
to
stay
up
all
night
if
necessary
in
order
to
guard
the
precious
aeroplane
once
in
the
field
the
boys
explained
to
felix
what
they
wanted
him
to
do
and
he
promised
not
to
meddle
with
anything
connected
with
the
engine
or
the
aeroplane
itself
they
were
passing
back
again
toward
the
barns
having
left
their
prized
possession
in
good
shape
when
andy
uttered
a
sudden
exclamation
that
told
of
both
surprise
and
disgust
what
the
matter
now
asked
frank
who
had
been
talking
with
felix
and
was
hence
not
so
wide
awake
as
his
chum
just
take
a
look
over
there
and
see
what
stopped
on
the
road
remarked
andy
seems
to
be
a
car
and
i
can
see
two
heads
raised
above
the
top
rail
of
the
fence
as
if
the
people
in
it
had
sighted
our
aeroplane
sprawled
out
there
in
the
field
and
were
wondering
what
sort
of
giant
insect
it
could
be
frank
went
on
look
closer
frank
the
other
boy
went
on
to
say
while
his
disgust
deepened
and
you
discover
that
the
two
fellows
in
that
car
happen
to
be
percy
carberry
and
his
shadow
sandy
hollingshead
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
tough
luck
of
all
the
boys
in
bloomsbury
they
are
the
last
we
want
to
know
that
we
left
our
new
hydroplane
out
unguarded
all
night
in
an
open
field
guess
i
wo
go
home
tonight
frank
rather
camp
out
here
with
felix
you
let
my
folks
know
and
turn
up
in
the
morning
with
a
new
piece
for
that
plane
that
settled
and
you
ca
change
it
chapter
ii
on
guard
perhaps
i
better
stay
with
you
andy
the
other
bird
boy
remarked
no
need
of
it
replied
andy
resolutely
besides
you
know
one
of
us
ought
to
get
busy
in
the
shop
making
that
new
piece
we
really
need
so
that
our
job
wo
have
to
be
done
over
again
you
go
frank
perhaps
quackenboss
would
let
you
have
a
horse
or
if
you
cared
to
you
give
percy
a
hail
and
he
take
you
back
to
town
i
reckon
goodness
knows
he
owes
you
a
heap
after
the
way
you
saved
his
life
the
time
he
was
wrecked
up
on
old
thundertop
what
andy
referred
to
was
a
very
exciting
event
which
had
occurred
not
so
very
long
before
and
which
was
fully
treated
in
the
volume
preceding
this
frank
shook
his
head
in
the
negative
i
never
want
to
ask
any
favor
of
percy
carberry
he
said
resolutely
and
if
quackenboss
ca
let
me
have
a
horse
to
ride
why
the
walking
is
good
and
i
can
make
it
in
less
than
an
hour
so
mention
that
again
please
andy
it
too
late
now
anyhow
remarked
the
other
drily
because
there
they
go
spinning
down
the
road
like
wildfire
percy
never
does
anything
except
in
a
whirl
he
as
bold
as
they
make
them
and
the
only
wonder
to
me
is
that
he
has
met
with
a
terrible
accident
before
now
but
somehow
he
seems
to
escape
even
when
he
smashes
his
flier
to
kindling
wood
his
luck
beats
the
dutch
he
believes
in
it
himself
you
know
but
some
day
it
going
to
fail
and
then
he
never
what
happened
to
him
declared
frank
of
all
the
professions
in
the
world
that
of
a
flying
machine
man
is
the
one
where
a
cool
head
and
quick
judgment
are
the
things
most
needed
and
the
fellow
who
takes
great
chances
depending
on
his
good
luck
is
bound
to
meet
up
with
trouble
but
if
you
are
bound
to
stay
andy
i
better
be
off
upon
entering
the
barn
they
found
that
the
farmer
had
finished
his
task
and
was
pitching
some
new
sweet
hay
to
the
cows
frank
suggested
hiring
a
horse
from
him
but
quackenboss
scoffed
at
the
idea
you
as
welcome
to
the
use
of
my
saddle
hoss
as
the
sunlight
is
after
a
spell
of
rain
he
said
heartily
here
felix
get
bob
out
and
you
find
my
new
saddle
hanging
on
that
peg
back
of
the
harness
room
door
and
as
for
andy
who
going
to
stay
over
with
us
we
find
a
chair
for
him
at
the
supper
table
and
only
hope
hell
tell
us
some
of
the
many
things
you
two
have
gone
through
with
both
around
this
region
and
away
down
in
south
america
that
time
you
found
the
lost
professor
inside
of
five
minutes
frank
was
in
the
saddle
and
waving
his
hand
to
his
chum
and
cousin
of
whom
he
was
more
fond
than
if
andy
had
been
his
own
brother
he
be
back
tonight
with
the
part
we
need
and
we
could
make
home
in
the
moonlight
said
andy
as
with
the
farmer
he
headed
for
the
house
only
both
of
us
have
promised
our
folks
not
to
travel
at
when
it
can
be
helped
even
if
the
moon
is
bright
there
always
a
risk
about
landing
because
it
a
tricky
light
at
the
best
and
even
a
little
mistake
may
wreck
things
and
so
frank
will
work
in
the
shop
tonight
and
be
along
in
the
morning
once
in
the
farmhouse
andy
was
given
a
chance
to
wash
up
and
then
met
the
housewife
as
well
as
little
billie
the
small
chap
whose
life
good
doctor
bird
had
saved
quackenboss
proved
to
be
a
very
woman
and
any
one
who
answered
to
the
name
of
bird
could
have
the
very
best
that
the
place
afforded
there
was
never
a
night
that
she
did
not
call
down
the
blessings
of
heaven
upon
the
physician
who
had
been
instrumental
in
preventing
her
darling
billie
from
being
taken
away
the
table
was
fairly
groaning
under
the
weight
of
good
things
to
eat
for
when
company
comes
the
average
farmer
wife
never
knows
when
to
stop
bringing
out
the
most
appetizing
things
to
eat
ever
seen
perhaps
i
the
luckiest
fellow
going
to
be
able
to
stay
with
you
quackenboss
laughed
andy
as
he
sat
down
to
the
generous
spread
well
you
know
we
never
like
anybody
to
get
up
from
our
table
hungry
she
explained
the
chances
are
that
i
wo
be
able
to
get
up
at
all
for
if
i
try
to
taste
half
i
see
here
i
be
foundered
as
sure
as
anything
andy
went
on
to
say
the
farmer
was
not
going
to
allow
much
time
to
pass
talking
about
common
topics
those
might
do
all
very
well
when
he
had
ordinary
guests
but
when
fortune
sent
him
one
of
the
now
famous
bird
boys
for
company
he
wanted
to
listen
to
some
thrilling
accounts
of
adventures
that
had
come
the
way
of
the
young
and
daring
aviators
from
the
time
they
built
their
first
aeroplane
after
purchasing
most
of
the
parts
and
found
that
they
had
an
immediate
rival
in
percy
carberry
andy
was
willing
to
oblige
and
kept
those
at
the
table
including
the
farm
hand
felix
boggs
thrilled
with
his
stories
but
the
farmer
could
not
help
but
notice
how
modest
the
boy
was
giving
most
of
the
credit
to
his
cousin
frank
when
everybody
about
bloomsbury
knew
that
andy
deserved
just
as
much
credit
if
not
more
than
the
other
bird
boy
after
supper
andy
and
felix
prepared
to
go
out
to
where
the
hydroplane
lay
they
meant
to
take
blankets
along
and
make
themselves
as
comfortable
as
possible
for
a
night
vigil
andy
would
not
have
dreamed
of
doing
this
only
for
the
fact
that
he
knew
percy
and
his
shadow
sandy
were
aware
of
the
plight
of
the
precious
flier
and
while
frank
was
inclined
to
partly
believe
that
the
carberry
boy
might
let
up
in
his
ways
for
awhile
at
least
after
all
they
had
done
for
him
up
on
old
thundertop
andy
could
not
bring
himself
to
trust
the
other
further
than
he
could
see
him
he
believed
that
the
nature
of
percy
was
so
rotten
as
he
called
it
that
given
a
chance
to
injure
his
successful
rivals
he
would
shut
his
eyes
to
all
sense
of
gratitude
and
just
lie
awake
nights
trying
to
get
the
better
of
them
by
fair
means
or
foul
andy
also
knew
that
the
other
was
particularly
chagrined
because
he
did
not
know
what
manner
of
a
new
flier
the
bird
boys
had
in
hand
now
he
had
resorted
to
various
expedients
in
order
to
find
out
but
all
without
success
on
this
account
if
no
other
then
andy
believed
that
the
others
would
be
apt
to
come
out
here
during
the
night
to
examine
the
hydroplane
with
the
aluminum
pontoons
under
its
body
for
floating
on
the
water
and
perhaps
to
slily
injure
it
in
such
a
fashion
that
it
would
break
down
when
next
frank
and
andy
mounted
into
the
air
it
happened
that
they
had
alighted
close
to
one
corner
of
the
big
field
though
in
plain
view
from
the
pike
andy
had
noted
a
clump
of
trees
conveniently
near
and
already
his
mind
was
made
up
that
he
and
felix
would
camp
there
to
pass
the
night
in
alternately
keeping
watch
and
ward
over
the
precious
aeroplane
that
lay
there
like
a
wounded
bird
felix
was
quivering
with
eagerness
this
was
like
a
picnic
in
the
humdrum
life
of
the
farm
hand
except
when
the
circus
came
to
town
or
there
was
a
harvest
home
day
poor
felix
knew
little
beyond
the
eternal
grind
of
getting
up
before
dawn
and
working
until
long
after
sunset
first
of
all
andy
walked
around
the
stranded
aeroplane
and
took
occasion
to
explain
how
it
worked
using
as
simple
language
as
he
could
find
because
felix
was
not
at
all
up
in
professional
terms
and
would
not
have
understood
had
the
other
spoken
as
he
might
have
done
when
talking
with
a
fellow
aviator
then
they
sought
the
trees
and
spreading
their
heavy
blankets
so
as
to
make
as
comfortable
a
seat
as
possible
started
to
talk
in
low
tones
the
bright
moon
hung
there
in
the
sky
and
it
seemed
as
though
every
foot
of
the
big
meadow
could
be
scrutinized
just
as
well
as
in
the
daytime
but
andy
knew
from
experience
how
deceptive
moonlight
can
be
and
how
cautious
one
has
to
be
when
trying
any
difficult
feat
at
such
a
time
i
heard
people
talk
about
reading
by
moonlight
and
how
they
could
tell
a
friend
half
a
mile
away
he
remarked
to
felix
but
let
me
say
that
it
all
a
humbug
there
never
was
a
brighter
night
than
this
i
reckon
you
agree
with
me
felix
and
yet
look
at
that
stump
not
a
stone
throw
away
you
could
say
now
whether
it
was
a
cow
lying
down
a
horse
a
rock
or
a
stump
which
last
i
take
the
thing
to
be
am
i
right
about
that
why
sure
i
live
that
ere
is
a
fact
andy
replied
the
other
but
i
never
a
thought
it
moonlight
fools
a
feller
the
worst
kind
i
throwed
a
stone
at
a
as
was
perched
on
the
roof
us
all
awake
nights
and
would
yuh
believe
me
she
went
right
through
the
winder
of
the
attic
kersmash
never
was
more
surprised
in
my
life
and
you
do
ketch
me
heavin
stones
by
moonlight
agin
from
one
subject
they
drifted
to
another
andy
even
told
more
or
less
about
how
percy
carberry
had
hated
and
envied
them
in
the
past
and
how
often
he
had
tried
to
do
them
a
serious
injury
frank
seems
to
think
he
will
give
up
that
mean
sort
of
play
because
we
really
saved
his
life
that
time
we
had
our
race
to
the
rock
on
the
summit
of
old
thundertop
and
his
aeroplane
was
smashed
there
so
one
of
us
had
to
carry
percy
and
sandy
home
bruised
as
they
were
but
i
do
because
i
know
it
take
more
than
that
to
change
the
spots
of
a
fellow
of
his
kind
and
chances
are
felix
we
find
those
two
boys
sneaking
up
here
before
the
middle
of
the
night
they
would
chuckled
the
farm
hand
you
ready
to
give
a
warm
time
of
it
i
guess
andy
be
as
good
as
any
old
circus
to
me
just
to
see
how
they
jump
when
you
open
up
let
come
says
i
the
sooner
the
better
too
long
they
lay
there
and
talked
in
low
tones
felix
wanted
to
make
the
best
of
this
glorious
chance
a
new
world
seemed
to
open
up
to
the
farm
hand
as
he
heard
of
the
wonderful
things
the
bird
boys
had
seen
and
taken
part
in
perhaps
ambition
was
beginning
to
awaken
in
the
soul
and
he
might
not
after
this
be
so
satisfied
to
plod
along
in
the
same
old
rut
every
day
of
the
year
perhaps
the
seed
thus
sown
might
take
root
and
bring
him
either
great
good
or
harm
as
the
tide
of
fortune
chose
we
heard
as
how
a
feller
was
up
there
to
watch
you
boys
fly
not
a
great
while
ago
andy
he
went
on
to
say
an
he
was
so
took
by
the
way
you
managed
things
that
he
wanted
to
get
you
to
go
in
with
a
big
concern
run
by
a
boss
airman
but
you
just
up
and
told
him
you
could
do
that
same
was
that
so
why
yes
you
must
mean
marsh
returned
the
other
modestly
i
believe
he
did
read
some
account
of
us
that
got
into
the
papers
and
was
sent
up
here
to
look
us
up
he
was
kind
enough
to
compliment
frank
on
the
way
he
made
that
corkscrew
climb
and
also
on
his
volplane
drop
said
we
had
both
of
them
down
pretty
fine
and
he
did
hint
at
our
having
a
chance
to
go
in
with
his
company
but
of
course
we
could
think
of
that
we
too
young
to
dream
of
being
professional
fliers
yet
and
besides
we
got
to
go
to
school
again
pretty
soon
so
we
turned
the
offer
down
but
marsh
was
mighty
kind
and
we
liked
him
a
heap
heard
how
he
was
watching
you
fly
when
that
little
chap
belonging
to
cragan
the
fisherman
got
overboard
out
in
the
lake
and
this
same
gent
he
saw
frank
dive
right
off
his
aeroplane
like
a
bullfrog
and
save
little
tommy
that
jest
took
him
by
storm
he
told
quackenboss
and
he
meant
to
get
you
boys
for
his
company
if
money
could
do
it
but
it
all
ended
in
smoke
did
it
it
was
almost
half
past
nine
before
andy
decided
that
the
time
had
come
for
them
to
shut
up
shop
and
do
no
more
talking
i
going
to
take
the
first
watch
myself
felix
and
i
promise
to
wake
you
up
when
i
get
to
gaping
whether
it
midnight
or
two
in
the
morning
he
said
as
he
settled
himself
more
comfortably
on
his
blanket
and
pulled
it
up
over
his
shoulders
because
the
night
air
was
already
quite
chilly
and
would
undoubtedly
be
much
more
so
ere
long
but
chances
air
andy
they
to
come
inside
an
hour
or
so
and
you
must
promise
to
give
me
a
kick
if
so
be
i
sleepin
then
you
will
wo
you
sure
replied
the
bird
boy
after
you
being
so
kind
as
to
keep
me
company
i
never
think
of
making
a
move
and
you
asleep
so
just
settle
down
and
do
get
excited
if
you
feel
me
pushing
my
toe
into
your
ribs
later
on
felix
was
tired
from
his
day
work
he
had
probably
been
constantly
busy
since
four
the
morning
before
it
was
therefore
a
fight
between
weary
muscles
and
brain
and
the
desire
to
stay
awake
in
order
to
see
all
that
went
on
this
lasted
for
perhaps
ten
minutes
then
andy
knew
that
nature
had
won
out
for
he
could
catch
the
regular
breathing
of
the
stout
farmhand
and
from
this
judged
that
felix
must
be
sound
asleep
from
where
andy
sat
he
had
a
fine
view
of
the
field
on
all
sides
of
the
broken
hydroplane
and
especially
in
that
quarter
toward
the
fence
beyond
which
the
road
leading
to
bloomsbury
lay
he
kept
up
a
constant
watch
never
relaxing
his
vigilance
for
a
single
second
for
andy
knew
that
while
one
might
be
on
guard
for
minutes
if
he
relaxed
just
for
a
breath
that
was
almost
sure
to
be
the
time
when
something
would
happen
how
often
he
had
proved
that
when
fishing
and
taking
his
eye
from
his
float
just
to
glance
up
at
some
passing
bird
when
down
it
would
bob
and
he
had
missed
a
chance
to
hook
a
finny
prize
the
time
passed
on
three
separate
times
did
andy
look
at
his
little
dollar
nickel
watch
and
in
the
bright
moonlight
he
could
see
that
it
was
now
after
eleven
he
was
beginning
to
believe
that
if
there
was
anything
doing
that
night
it
must
come
about
very
soon
when
he
thought
he
heard
a
sound
down
the
road
that
made
him
think
a
car
that
had
been
coming
along
had
stopped
short
thrilled
with
the
expectation
that
a
change
was
about
to
occur
he
sat
up
a
little
more
eagerly
and
continued
to
scan
the
line
of
fence
as
well
as
the
field
lying
between
the
road
and
the
helpless
hydroplane
chapter
iii
not
caught
napping
five
ten
minutes
passed
andy
was
beginning
to
fear
that
after
all
he
had
been
mistaken
and
that
it
had
been
some
other
sound
he
had
heard
when
he
thought
a
car
had
stopped
down
the
road
toward
bloomsbury
then
all
at
once
he
detected
a
movement
over
at
the
fence
and
the
figure
of
a
man
or
boy
was
seen
to
quickly
clamber
over
dropping
in
the
field
even
as
he
looked
a
second
followed
suit
then
a
third
and
even
a
fourth
whew
what
all
this
mean
andy
whispered
to
himself
as
he
took
notice
of
the
fact
that
there
was
quite
a
procession
of
fellows
changing
base
from
the
road
to
the
field
percy
and
sandy
thought
they
might
need
help
in
their
little
game
of
smashing
our
machine
or
carrying
it
off
somewhere
so
as
to
give
us
a
bad
scare
and
i
reckon
they
picked
up
a
couple
more
of
the
same
kind
as
themselves
well
we
ought
to
be
able
to
take
care
of
four
just
as
easy
as
two
and
the
howl
will
be
all
the
louder
i
guess
he
moved
over
a
little
and
with
the
toe
of
his
shoe
nudged
felix
under
the
ribs
quit
shovin
there
muttered
the
farm
hand
possibly
thinking
he
was
in
bed
with
some
other
boy
luckily
the
night
breeze
was
making
the
windmill
turn
not
very
far
away
and
as
it
needed
oiling
there
was
a
constant
succession
of
squeaks
and
groans
so
that
the
chances
of
felix
being
heard
when
he
spoke
in
this
way
were
very
small
andy
would
not
take
any
further
risk
but
creeping
over
shook
the
boy
roughly
wake
up
felix
they
coming
across
the
pasture
he
whispered
in
his
ear
that
was
quite
enough
for
felix
he
seemed
to
grasp
the
situation
at
once
and
only
muttering
the
one
significant
word
gosh
he
immediately
sat
up
andy
moving
as
little
as
possible
pointed
to
where
moving
figures
could
just
be
detected
advancing
in
a
attitude
how
many
whispered
the
farm
hand
i
counted
four
replied
the
other
whee
bully
for
that
chuckled
felix
no
doubt
tickled
because
the
promised
circus
would
be
a
affair
instead
of
the
ordinary
kind
and
therefore
quite
up
to
date
both
of
them
lay
there
watching
intently
they
could
see
how
the
intruders
were
crawling
along
anxious
apparently
only
to
avoid
being
seen
from
the
direction
of
the
farmhouse
the
roof
of
which
showed
dimly
in
the
moonlight
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
little
ridge
as
the
creepers
drew
closer
the
watchers
saw
that
they
had
adopted
the
method
spoken
of
by
the
farmer
in
connection
with
the
bank
thieves
keeping
their
identity
secret
they
all
seemed
to
have
handkerchiefs
tied
across
their
faces
and
kept
their
hats
pulled
well
down
so
that
they
could
easily
have
passed
close
to
an
acquaintance
without
much
risk
of
discovery
of
course
andy
could
tell
that
they
were
boys
and
not
men
and
it
was
an
easy
task
for
him
to
guess
who
two
of
the
party
at
least
must
be
the
preparations
he
and
felix
had
made
were
about
as
simple
as
anything
could
be
the
farm
hand
possessed
an
old
musket
that
had
been
used
in
the
civil
war
and
which
muzzleloader
that
it
was
had
probably
brought
down
many
a
plump
rabbit
when
held
in
the
hands
of
the
owner
as
well
as
black
ducks
in
the
marshes
along
the
shore
of
lake
sunrise
besides
this
the
farmer
had
loaned
andy
his
marlin
shotgun
an
old
model
when
compared
with
the
hammerless
and
the
repeaters
but
no
doubt
a
good
serviceable
weapon
of
course
they
had
no
idea
of
trying
to
pepper
the
marauders
though
it
would
seem
as
though
they
richly
deserved
to
be
punctured
with
a
few
small
bird
shot
because
of
the
meanness
of
their
contemplated
action
to
give
them
a
good
fright
would
satisfy
andy
and
he
had
made
the
eager
farm
hand
promise
to
fire
up
in
the
air
also
because
he
was
afraid
lest
felix
allow
his
indignation
to
have
full
swing
when
he
saw
what
the
four
boys
meant
to
do
they
were
skulking
very
close
to
where
the
aeroplane
lay
now
and
the
critical
moment
had
undoubtedly
arrived
when
the
surprise
must
be
launched
ready
felix
he
whispered
in
the
softest
of
tones
yep
grunted
the
farm
hand
at
his
elbow
one
two
three
blaze
away
with
the
last
word
felix
let
go
with
his
old
musket
into
which
he
must
have
rammed
a
tremendous
charge
for
it
made
a
report
like
unto
the
crash
of
thunder
and
came
very
near
sending
the
owner
flat
on
his
back
immediately
on
the
heels
of
this
boom
andy
pulled
one
of
the
triggers
of
his
so
that
the
report
seemed
almost
merged
in
with
that
of
the
other
weapon
the
four
boys
had
jumped
to
their
feet
at
the
flash
and
report
which
startled
them
when
felix
fired
and
as
they
turned
to
dash
wildly
away
and
that
second
shot
came
they
became
madly
excited
evidently
under
the
full
belief
that
they
were
being
made
targets
for
a
whole
battalion
of
sharpshooters
two
of
them
collided
and
rolled
over
on
the
grass
kicking
wildly
and
scrambling
to
their
feet
again
to
resume
their
flight
toward
the
fence
which
doubtless
seemed
three
times
as
distant
as
when
they
were
creeping
toward
the
stranded
aeroplane
the
whole
thing
was
so
ridiculous
that
andy
burst
out
laughing
and
could
hardly
hold
his
gun
seeing
which
the
farm
hand
made
bold
to
snatch
it
out
of
his
hands
and
aiming
directly
at
the
place
where
the
fugitives
were
just
then
in
the
act
of
mounting
the
fence
in
their
panicky
flight
he
pulled
the
trigger
there
was
a
series
of
loud
yells
which
would
seem
to
indicate
that
a
few
of
the
small
shot
contained
in
the
shells
with
which
the
marlin
had
been
loaded
must
have
reached
their
mark
and
pricked
the
boys
like
so
many
needles
would
have
done
that
was
the
last
seen
of
them
though
for
a
short
time
they
could
be
heard
running
along
the
hard
road
and
exchanging
excited
comments
possibly
comparing
their
injuries
then
a
car
was
heard
to
start
off
with
a
great
deal
of
bluster
and
came
dashing
along
past
the
farmhouse
though
those
in
it
bent
low
enough
to
keep
any
one
from
discovering
who
they
might
be
andy
did
not
know
whether
to
be
a
little
angry
or
not
because
of
what
the
impetuous
felix
had
done
but
apparently
nobody
had
been
seriously
hurt
and
on
the
whole
the
four
sneaks
as
felix
called
them
deserved
some
punishment
so
he
let
it
go
at
that
there
was
no
further
alarm
that
night
neither
of
the
guardians
of
the
hydroplane
expected
any
after
the
prompt
measures
that
had
been
taken
to
inform
meddlers
of
the
warm
reception
they
might
expect
all
the
same
andy
kept
up
his
vigil
until
sleep
almost
overpowered
him
when
he
aroused
felix
to
finish
out
the
night
with
the
coming
of
early
dawn
he
knew
that
the
safety
of
the
imperiled
aeroplane
was
assured
and
that
when
the
horn
blew
he
and
felix
could
both
go
in
to
breakfast
indeed
he
released
the
farm
hand
long
before
that
time
so
that
he
might
go
about
his
usual
early
morning
chores
and
andy
himself
found
plenty
to
do
around
the
machine
until
summoned
to
the
morning
meal
the
farmer
was
a
hard
sleeper
and
had
not
heard
a
single
thing
that
had
taken
place
so
that
he
was
surprised
when
told
how
the
enemy
had
come
after
all
and
what
measures
the
boys
had
taken
in
order
to
frighten
them
away
he
even
told
felix
he
could
have
a
day
off
as
soon
as
the
last
load
of
hay
was
in
the
barn
just
to
show
how
he
appreciated
the
bold
way
in
which
his
hired
help
had
tickled
the
rascals
when
they
were
getting
over
the
fence
indeed
the
farmer
said
andy
had
been
too
lenient
and
that
if
it
had
been
his
aeroplane
that
was
threatened
in
that
mean
way
he
would
have
felt
wholly
justified
in
emptying
both
barrels
of
the
gun
after
the
marauders
first
giving
them
time
to
get
a
certain
distance
off
so
that
no
serious
results
might
follow
the
discharge
but
andy
was
never
a
vindictive
lad
and
he
believed
the
fellows
had
received
sufficient
punishment
especially
as
no
one
knew
exactly
what
they
had
meant
to
do
in
connection
with
the
new
hydroplane
possibly
percy
only
wanted
to
look
it
over
at
close
quarters
and
knowing
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
do
so
if
he
asked
permission
outright
sought
to
take
this
opportunity
but
from
the
way
in
which
they
had
rigged
themselves
out
so
as
to
avoid
being
recognized
if
seen
it
looked
as
though
the
four
boys
had
something
more
than
that
in
view
however
all
well
that
ends
well
and
andy
was
quite
satisfied
with
the
way
things
had
turned
out
here
hopin
a
few
of
may
be
limpin
this
same
mornin
and
feelin
rayther
stiff
in
the
legs
felix
took
occasion
to
remark
as
they
sat
at
table
and
andy
was
again
in
danger
of
being
foundered
by
the
multitude
of
good
things
which
the
farmer
wife
spread
thereon
bacon
and
eggs
fried
potatoes
scrapple
puffy
biscuits
apple
sauce
doughnuts
cold
pie
jelly
and
finally
heaping
dishes
of
light
pancakes
which
were
to
be
smothered
in
butter
and
real
maple
syrup
made
on
the
farm
each
early
spring
when
the
sap
was
running
i
expect
frank
will
be
along
any
minute
now
andy
remarked
about
the
time
he
had
to
firmly
refuse
a
fourth
helping
of
cakes
because
he
could
hardly
breathe
comfortably
it
would
take
him
long
to
do
what
little
work
was
necessary
in
our
shop
which
you
know
my
old
guardian
colonel
whympers
built
for
us
before
we
found
my
father
when
he
was
marooned
in
that
valley
in
south
america
a
prisoner
for
many
months
because
the
cliffs
around
prevented
him
from
escaping
and
of
course
he
gallop
out
here
on
your
saddle
horse
mr
quackenboss
well
work
ai
got
any
call
on
either
felix
or
me
until
we
see
all
that
goes
on
that
flat
remarked
the
farmer
with
a
smile
and
lucky
he
done
the
milkin
already
or
else
the
cows
have
to
wait
long
after
their
usual
hour
which
is
a
bad
way
to
treat
you
know
they
all
went
out
to
the
field
even
the
housewife
and
little
billie
wanting
to
see
what
a
real
aeroplane
looked
like
at
close
quarters
many
times
had
all
of
them
seen
the
bird
boys
and
perhaps
percy
carberry
as
well
soaring
aloft
as
if
the
upper
air
currents
might
be
their
natural
heritage
but
up
to
now
they
had
never
had
the
chance
to
examine
one
of
the
wonderful
machines
and
touch
the
various
parts
gingerly
as
though
afraid
of
injuring
them
beats
all
what
people
are
nowadays
ventured
the
farmer
shaking
his
head
with
astonishment
almost
awe
as
he
looked
the
thing
over
they
ai
even
contented
to
just
fly
like
a
hawk
or
an
eagle
that
kin
look
the
sun
direct
in
the
eye
but
now
they
got
to
have
a
contraption
that
at
home
in
the
air
or
on
the
water
a
hydroplane
you
called
it
did
you
andy
and
them
ere
twin
pontoons
underneath
that
look
kinder
like
gondolas
as
you
say
are
made
of
aluminum
and
kin
hold
up
the
whole
affair
when
you
light
on
water
but
tell
me
how
in
all
creation
kin
you
ever
mount
up
agin
once
you
settle
there
why
that
the
easiest
thing
of
all
replied
the
young
aviator
you
watched
a
wild
duck
get
up
many
a
time
have
you
quackenboss
well
we
do
just
the
same
only
instead
of
flapping
our
wings
we
start
the
engine
and
skim
along
the
surface
for
a
little
distance
then
elevate
the
planes
and
immediately
begin
to
soar
upward
and
it
does
the
stunt
as
gracefully
as
anything
you
ever
saw
some
time
i
hope
to
give
you
a
chance
to
see
how
it
works
when
we
leave
here
of
course
we
use
the
bicycle
wheels
you
see
underneath
and
run
along
the
ground
until
going
fast
enough
to
soar
but
i
think
i
see
frank
coming
away
down
the
road
there
that
right
declared
the
farmer
i
know
my
bob
as
far
as
i
can
see
him
and
his
gallop
in
the
bargain
frank
was
evidently
coming
at
full
speed
and
andy
presently
got
the
idea
in
his
head
that
his
cousin
seemed
to
be
strangely
in
a
hurry
for
him
he
wondered
whether
anything
could
have
happened
at
home
and
if
frank
would
prove
to
be
the
bearer
of
bad
news
the
other
dashed
into
the
narrow
road
leading
from
the
pike
to
the
barns
of
the
quackenboss
farm
hitching
the
horse
to
a
post
he
started
toward
the
spot
in
the
big
field
where
the
two
boys
and
the
farmer
awaited
his
coming
close
beside
the
stranded
aeroplane
frank
was
carrying
the
little
part
he
had
expected
to
knock
together
at
the
workshop
but
as
he
drew
nearer
his
chum
could
readily
see
that
he
was
considerably
excited
is
everything
all
right
here
andy
he
called
out
even
before
reaching
them
yes
replied
the
other
bird
boy
promptly
though
we
did
have
a
call
from
four
fellows
who
had
their
faces
hidden
behind
handkerchiefs
but
we
fired
our
guns
in
the
air
and
nearly
frightened
them
to
death
felix
grabbed
the
i
had
and
gave
them
a
last
shot
when
they
were
climbing
the
fence
over
there
and
we
heard
some
howls
too
so
i
guess
a
few
of
the
number
eight
shot
pinked
them
but
what
makes
you
look
so
bothered
frank
has
anything
happened
at
home
there
sure
has
came
from
frank
as
he
joined
them
and
cast
a
pleased
glance
over
the
flying
machine
that
lay
upon
the
grass
like
a
huge
bat
with
wings
extended
tell
me
what
it
was
demanded
andy
breathlessly
somebody
broke
into
our
hangar
and
workshop
and
knocked
things
around
at
a
great
rate
frank
went
on
to
say
acted
like
they
might
be
just
mad
because
they
did
find
our
new
machine
there
and
wanted
to
show
their
spite
and
nobody
in
your
house
knew
a
thing
about
it
till
i
came
along
after
an
early
breakfast
meaning
to
get
the
piece
i
been
working
on
up
to
eleven
last
night
when
i
went
home
to
sleep
and
locked
up
the
place
as
usual
that
a
queer
piece
of
news
you
telling
me
frank
said
the
other
looking
puzzled
as
well
he
might
chapter
iv
the
startling
news
well
said
frank
with
a
frown
on
his
face
it
puzzled
me
a
whole
lot
let
me
tell
you
andy
because
of
course
my
first
thought
was
that
it
must
have
been
percy
carberry
work
but
now
that
you
tell
me
he
was
here
and
knew
we
had
fetched
our
hydroplane
home
i
hardly
know
what
to
think
did
you
say
you
worked
till
about
eleven
at
the
shop
asked
andy
quickly
three
minutes
after
when
i
quit
locked
up
and
went
home
frank
replied
that
was
just
about
the
time
they
showed
up
here
the
other
went
on
to
say
unless
one
of
us
is
wrong
about
the
time
they
could
well
be
in
two
places
at
the
same
minute
now
could
they
seems
like
it
might
have
been
some
other
crowd
that
broke
into
our
hangar
frank
but
why
did
they
want
to
play
fast
and
loose
with
our
machine
and
force
an
entrance
just
for
that
purpose
listen
to
something
i
going
to
tell
you
andy
i
found
several
things
on
our
work
bench
where
somebody
had
left
them
without
meaning
to
do
it
i
guess
here
one
frank
while
saying
this
held
something
up
which
he
had
taken
from
the
package
he
carried
under
his
arm
why
that
a
splendid
electric
torch
looks
like
to
me
exclaimed
andy
just
what
it
is
now
the
other
agreed
and
it
was
forgotten
in
our
shop
was
it
demanded
andy
i
made
out
that
whoever
entered
used
this
first
and
then
lighted
our
lamp
to
look
around
with
putting
out
the
torch
and
laying
it
down
when
they
skipped
out
why
they
just
forgot
all
about
it
also
these
again
did
frank
make
a
dive
into
his
pocket
and
dangled
something
before
the
astonished
eyes
of
his
cousin
great
caesar
what
d
call
those
things
gasped
andy
staring
as
though
hardly
able
to
believe
his
eyes
well
as
near
as
i
can
make
out
they
a
couple
of
half
masks
made
out
of
black
muslin
and
just
like
a
domino
worn
at
a
masquerade
ball
frank
remarked
with
positive
conviction
in
his
voice
and
manner
masks
echoed
the
other
and
the
fellows
who
broke
open
our
shop
wore
them
did
they
well
the
crowd
that
came
out
here
seemed
to
be
satisfied
to
tie
handkerchiefs
across
their
faces
and
pull
their
hats
down
i
do
know
that
they
wore
them
frank
went
on
but
they
had
the
things
along
and
laid
them
down
with
the
lantern
forgetting
the
whole
lot
when
they
cleared
out
perhaps
your
dog
got
to
barking
and
frightened
them
off
before
they
found
a
chance
to
do
much
damage
a
regular
bullseye
electric
torch
and
black
masks
like
cracksmen
use
say
tell
me
frank
what
coming
over
our
quiet
country
up
here
lately
there
was
the
affair
over
in
a
neighboring
town
when
yeggmen
broke
into
the
bank
and
robbed
it
and
now
here
you
tell
me
we
had
a
little
on
our
own
account
with
the
burglars
leaving
cards
behind
them
but
what
d
think
now
anybody
would
want
to
go
poking
around
in
our
shop
for
frank
his
cousin
was
looking
very
grave
well
you
forget
that
we
been
working
overtime
this
winter
on
several
little
inventions
that
if
we
ever
complete
them
will
make
a
stir
in
the
world
of
aviation
jupiter
i
had
let
that
slip
away
from
me
for
a
fact
frank
exclaimed
the
other
looking
rather
startled
of
course
it
sounds
pretty
big
for
us
to
even
imagine
that
any
party
could
take
enough
interest
in
what
the
bird
boys
are
doing
to
come
up
here
intending
to
break
into
the
shop
and
learn
our
secrets
but
what
else
can
we
think
tell
me
that
andy
but
they
would
find
out
much
even
if
they
had
six
hours
to
poke
around
our
shop
in
would
they
frank
i
guess
you
right
because
we
made
it
a
rule
to
be
cautious
enough
to
hide
our
work
and
cover
our
tracks
as
we
go
along
but
get
busy
now
and
put
the
plane
into
shape
so
we
can
slip
along
home
and
as
we
work
we
can
keep
on
talking
as
much
as
we
want
to
frank
went
on
to
say
the
farmer
and
felix
still
loitered
around
determined
to
see
the
wonderful
contrivance
make
a
start
and
expecting
the
greatest
treat
of
their
lives
when
that
event
occurred
such
experienced
workers
as
the
two
bird
boys
had
now
become
would
find
little
or
no
trouble
about
carrying
out
the
work
they
had
on
hand
every
steel
wire
guy
was
kept
as
taut
as
a
fiddle
string
and
by
the
time
they
were
done
handling
the
aeroplane
it
would
be
in
shape
for
work
did
they
smash
much
in
the
shop
frank
andy
asked
after
they
had
been
working
some
little
time
and
making
fair
progress
why
no
it
did
seem
to
me
that
they
took
the
time
to
do
great
damage
and
that
why
i
fancy
they
were
scared
off
somehow
or
other
they
went
in
a
hurry
or
else
they
would
never
have
forgotten
those
things
and
when
i
looked
around
i
made
up
my
mind
that
they
were
just
mad
because
they
did
find
our
machine
at
home
and
so
tried
to
let
us
know
that
fact
perhaps
it
was
a
second
detachment
of
the
same
crowd
that
came
out
here
suggested
andy
speculatively
tell
me
what
would
they
be
doing
with
electric
torches
and
black
masks
now
you
can
see
that
these
have
been
pretty
well
used
not
new
ones
just
cut
out
by
pattern
at
home
with
mother
scissors
these
have
been
made
by
an
experienced
operator
and
were
bought
either
for
a
mask
ball
or
some
other
purpose
well
perhaps
we
never
know
the
truth
about
it
grumbled
andy
who
never
liked
anything
to
puzzle
him
and
would
lie
awake
half
the
night
trying
to
find
the
answer
to
a
conundrum
that
had
been
offered
to
him
by
a
boy
friend
oh
yes
i
got
a
hunch
that
we
will
chirped
his
cousin
with
a
sublime
confidence
that
quite
won
andy
heart
if
he
could
not
see
any
good
reason
for
hope
himself
the
fact
that
his
chum
pinned
his
faith
on
it
was
enough
to
bolster
up
his
own
courage
meanwhile
they
were
both
as
busy
as
bees
and
the
work
was
approaching
completion
what
are
you
looking
up
every
little
while
that
way
for
frank
asked
after
noticing
that
andy
cocked
his
eye
upward
several
times
and
appeared
to
be
scanning
the
heavens
in
an
expectant
manner
the
day
is
all
right
so
far
as
wind
goes
and
we
ought
to
get
along
home
without
a
bit
of
trouble
oh
i
was
bothering
my
head
about
that
part
of
it
the
other
replied
with
a
scornful
smile
we
been
out
in
all
sorts
of
weather
and
now
that
we
have
a
chance
to
try
this
new
invention
of
the
wrights
that
makes
it
next
to
impossible
to
tilt
an
aeroplane
over
no
matter
how
you
move
around
when
up
in
the
air
we
can
feel
safer
than
ever
even
a
fool
would
be
kept
from
meeting
with
an
accident
when
protected
by
that
wonderful
balancing
bar
that
responds
to
the
slightest
movement
of
the
human
body
then
it
was
something
else
you
had
on
your
mind
was
it
andy
well
i
was
wondering
just
what
took
percy
and
sandy
out
at
daybreak
this
morning
that
all
replied
the
other
what
that
did
you
see
them
pass
over
in
their
biplane
this
morning
demanded
the
other
felix
woke
me
up
at
dawn
to
tell
me
there
was
a
queer
chugging
overhead
that
sort
of
scared
him
i
jumped
up
because
of
course
i
knew
what
that
must
mean
and
sure
enough
i
was
just
in
time
to
see
a
biplane
pass
over
at
a
good
height
and
head
up
the
lake
i
lost
it
back
of
the
barn
because
a
flock
of
crows
came
flying
along
stretching
out
for
a
mile
or
two
and
among
the
lot
i
could
make
out
just
what
was
biplane
and
which
was
crow
it
was
pretty
high
up
too
i
thought
but
you
made
sure
it
was
percy
biplane
asked
frank
interested
somewhat
for
somehow
the
other
rival
flier
was
always
doing
such
bold
stunts
that
he
could
not
help
feeling
as
though
it
might
pay
to
keep
track
of
what
he
was
doing
lest
their
interests
clash
unexpectedly
in
midair
perhaps
i
ought
to
know
the
way
it
glides
and
the
whole
general
look
and
be
willing
to
take
my
affidavy
that
was
the
as
he
calls
his
biplane
and
he
was
in
it
of
course
with
sandy
too
frank
went
on
i
could
just
make
out
that
there
were
two
aboard
said
andy
but
somehow
it
seemed
to
me
that
percy
had
altered
his
whole
way
of
piloting
his
airship
or
else
he
was
drunk
and
hardly
knew
what
he
was
doing
frank
whistled
to
indicate
his
surprise
and
consternation
when
it
gets
as
rough
as
that
you
can
take
it
from
me
that
mother
will
hear
something
simply
awful
about
him
before
long
bound
to
go
from
bad
to
worse
and
everybody
knows
what
the
end
of
such
an
aviator
is
going
to
be
but
what
under
the
sun
could
he
be
off
at
daylight
this
morning
for
andy
went
on
to
remark
as
though
that
thing
had
been
bothering
him
ever
since
the
moment
he
lost
track
of
the
biplane
among
the
teetering
cawing
crows
frank
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
he
replied
did
you
ever
know
any
reason
for
half
the
things
percy
does
he
just
acts
from
a
sudden
impulse
remember
all
that
happened
when
he
followed
us
down
there
to
columbia
in
south
america
and
tried
to
give
us
all
the
trouble
he
could
make
up
and
there
have
been
lots
of
other
times
too
we
can
look
back
at
all
of
which
prove
what
i
am
saying
that
he
is
often
like
a
ship
without
a
rudder
now
perhaps
he
got
the
crazy
notion
in
his
head
that
we
might
prosecute
him
either
for
what
he
tried
to
do
up
here
to
our
hydroplane
or
on
account
of
breaking
into
our
hangar
and
doing
a
certain
amount
of
damage
if
the
vandal
was
percy
carberry
that
sounds
a
little
reasonable
anyhow
frank
queer
that
i
never
seem
to
get
hold
of
these
things
and
they
just
float
along
as
easy
as
anything
to
you
but
it
looks
as
if
we
had
her
all
primed
up
now
as
steady
as
a
church
how
about
it
frank
for
answer
the
other
touched
several
taut
wire
guys
with
a
peculiar
little
movement
of
finger
and
thumb
and
each
one
responded
with
a
musical
note
that
was
the
sweetest
possible
sound
in
the
responsive
ear
of
the
young
aviators
all
done
and
let
be
off
he
said
presently
after
the
last
test
had
been
applied
accordingly
they
shook
hands
with
farmer
quackenboss
his
good
wife
and
felix
in
the
palm
of
which
latter
andy
made
sure
to
leave
a
greenback
that
made
the
boy
grin
broadly
three
minutes
later
frank
sang
out
the
word
and
both
the
farmer
and
felix
ran
along
with
the
machine
for
a
dozen
paces
or
so
when
it
left
them
behind
taking
on
speed
and
finally
rushing
over
the
ground
at
a
tremendous
pace
uptilting
the
planes
caused
it
to
leave
the
ground
and
start
to
curve
gracefully
upward
as
the
whizzing
propeller
did
its
noisy
duty
they
could
hear
the
farmer
and
his
hired
hand
shouting
themselves
hoarse
with
delight
at
having
actually
witnessed
the
start
of
a
modern
aeroplane
but
naturally
the
sound
grew
fainter
and
fainter
in
their
ears
as
they
left
the
field
and
the
squatty
farmhouse
far
behind
having
arisen
to
the
height
of
several
hundred
feet
frank
headed
toward
bloomsbury
like
a
true
and
alert
pilot
he
was
watching
and
listening
to
ascertain
how
their
recent
work
held
and
presently
a
satisfied
expression
crossing
his
face
announced
that
he
found
his
faith
well
justified
they
had
skimmed
along
for
perhaps
a
mile
or
more
when
andy
made
a
certain
discovery
that
caused
him
to
call
out
look
along
the
road
below
and
ahead
frank
he
said
and
you
see
something
that
makes
you
think
of
old
times
when
we
hunted
in
company
with
chief
waller
for
those
men
who
looted
leffingwell
jewelry
establishment
why
as
sure
as
you
born
andy
it
does
look
like
the
chief
and
he
sitting
in
a
vehicle
waving
his
hat
he
seems
to
be
looking
up
at
us
and
now
that
i
turned
off
the
motor
to
glide
a
little
i
can
hear
him
shouting
frank
do
you
think
he
just
saluting
us
or
does
he
want
us
to
come
down
demanded
andy
in
some
apprehension
now
he
making
all
sorts
of
gestures
and
honestly
i
think
he
means
that
he
wants
to
see
us
had
we
better
drop
in
that
open
field
just
alongside
the
road
looks
good
to
me
for
a
rise
when
we
want
to
start
again
whatever
you
think
best
frank
i
always
willing
to
be
guided
by
you
mighty
seldom
you
make
a
bad
mess
of
it
while
i
often
do
yes
drop
down
and
if
the
field
turns
out
to
be
pretty
smooth
we
land
accordingly
the
hydroplane
which
was
of
course
now
in
a
condition
for
making
a
landing
with
the
wheels
below
the
aluminum
pontoons
circled
around
dropping
lower
and
lower
until
presently
it
came
to
a
stop
in
the
field
close
to
the
fence
when
it
landed
it
was
done
so
beautifully
that
as
andy
enthusiastically
said
an
egg
would
hardly
have
broken
had
it
come
between
and
there
not
more
than
twenty
feet
away
the
man
dressed
in
a
blue
uniform
and
wearing
a
silver
shield
with
the
words
chief
of
police
engraved
upon
it
was
soothing
his
horse
which
had
apparently
been
badly
frightened
by
the
swooping
down
of
what
seemed
to
be
a
great
roc
or
some
other
species
of
now
extinct
gigantic
kings
of
the
air
what
up
chief
asked
frank
as
soon
as
they
had
reached
the
road
together
then
you
have
heard
the
terrible
news
they
told
me
you
left
home
to
come
up
here
about
daybreak
and
we
did
find
it
out
until
an
hour
ago
the
bank
in
bloomsbury
was
broken
open
last
night
the
safe
rifled
and
the
thieves
have
disappeared
in
the
queerest
way
ever
heard
of
for
they
left
no
trace
behind
and
when
i
saw
you
boys
aloft
i
was
in
hopes
you
might
have
seen
something
of
the
bank
looters
chapter
v
the
excitement
grows
well
what
d
think
of
that
for
news
eh
frank
burst
out
andy
in
his
usual
impetuous
way
after
the
bloomsbury
chief
of
police
had
made
this
startling
announcement
frank
was
as
a
rule
much
cooler
than
his
cousin
he
had
undoubtedly
been
equally
astounded
to
hear
of
the
terrible
calamity
that
had
befallen
the
banking
institution
in
which
most
of
the
leading
citizens
of
the
town
were
financially
interested
but
he
certainly
did
not
show
it
the
same
way
his
eyebrows
went
up
to
indicate
astonishment
and
a
slight
frown
settled
on
his
grave
face
as
he
replied
to
andy
question
it
a
stunner
just
as
you
say
andy
but
i
wish
the
chief
would
tell
us
a
few
more
details
i
think
it
a
little
queer
nobody
seemed
to
have
any
suspicion
of
this
awful
business
at
the
time
i
left
home
on
horseback
to
ride
up
to
the
quackenboss
farm
where
you
had
been
watching
our
injured
aeroplane
all
night
well
continued
the
head
of
the
bloomsbury
police
force
because
the
yeggs
worked
so
neatly
they
never
left
a
bit
of
mess
around
to
arouse
suspicion
and
the
first
thing
that
was
known
of
the
looting
of
the
bank
was
when
seth
jarvie
the
day
watchman
went
into
the
place
at
seven
this
morning
to
relieve
cadger
the
night
man
and
found
him
lying
there
tied
up
like
a
bundle
of
goods
and
nearly
dead
with
fright
and
humiliation
whew
was
the
way
andy
relieved
his
feelings
at
this
point
while
his
cousin
went
on
asking
questions
then
cadger
must
have
seen
the
robbers
if
they
captured
him
how
about
that
chief
he
demanded
eagerly
for
the
excitement
was
beginning
to
take
hold
of
him
that
right
he
did
and
was
able
to
give
us
more
or
less
information
the
police
officer
continued
of
course
as
soon
as
jarvie
saw
what
had
happened
he
knew
it
was
a
case
for
me
to
handle
and
so
he
ran
across
to
headquarters
and
in
a
jiffy
we
had
thrown
a
cordon
of
police
around
the
building
to
keep
out
the
curious
citizens
who
would
have
no
business
inside
and
spoil
any
trace
of
the
rascals
and
would
you
mind
telling
us
what
cadger
had
to
tell
chief
asked
frank
not
at
all
because
i
depending
on
you
boys
to
help
run
the
thieves
down
if
you
feel
like
giving
the
authorities
any
assistance
the
other
replied
craftily
frank
answer
was
immediate
and
to
the
point
of
course
we
do
anything
that
in
our
power
chief
both
our
fathers
are
interested
in
that
bank
and
besides
the
good
name
of
the
town
must
suffer
if
it
is
wrecked
by
a
wandering
band
of
yeggmen
and
we
can
understand
why
you
should
want
to
capture
the
thieves
chief
because
that
a
part
of
your
business
please
tell
us
what
the
bank
watchman
had
to
say
then
i
will
and
without
any
frills
if
i
can
make
it
that
way
returned
the
other
earnestly
cadger
says
he
was
caught
napping
not
that
he
was
asleep
but
never
dreaming
of
any
danger
he
stepped
over
to
the
door
when
he
heard
a
knock
and
a
voice
said
me
cadger
hedden
the
cashier
i
forgot
some
important
papers
and
have
gotten
out
of
bed
to
come
back
for
them
let
me
in
without
attracting
any
attention
if
you
can
what
do
you
think
of
the
smartness
of
that
exclaimed
andy
and
so
of
course
poor
old
cadger
who
is
as
honest
as
the
day
is
long
never
suspected
any
trick
but
went
and
opened
the
door
a
crack
just
what
he
did
returned
the
chief
and
as
that
side
of
the
bank
was
in
the
shadow
he
could
only
see
the
figure
of
a
man
who
slipped
in
alongside
him
before
he
knew
what
was
happening
he
was
being
chocked
by
a
pair
of
strong
hands
cadger
started
to
struggle
but
another
man
must
have
joined
the
first
for
he
was
knocked
unconscious
by
a
cruel
blow
that
left
his
face
all
bloody
and
after
that
he
did
know
a
thing
for
an
hour
or
two
whee
you
got
me
all
worked
up
with
your
story
chief
said
andy
again
i
can
just
seem
to
see
the
whole
thing
happening
and
chances
are
that
when
cadger
did
come
to
he
found
himself
tied
up
and
unable
to
even
whisper
he
had
hard
work
to
get
enough
breath
they
had
fastened
the
bandage
across
his
mouth
so
tight
but
he
could
see
out
of
one
eye
and
lying
there
cadger
watched
the
two
yeggs
go
through
the
whole
operation
of
getting
nitroglycerine
planted
and
using
all
sorts
of
clothes
and
even
the
rugs
off
the
floor
of
the
president
room
to
deaden
the
sound
of
the
explosion
they
were
old
hands
at
the
business
that
sure
remarked
frank
when
the
officer
paused
to
catch
his
breath
for
he
was
talking
unusually
fast
in
his
desire
to
give
them
all
the
particulars
in
as
brief
a
space
of
time
as
possible
yes
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
the
chief
went
on
to
say
wagging
his
head
wisely
and
they
had
been
able
in
some
way
to
get
on
to
a
lot
of
things
that
make
us
wonder
like
the
name
of
the
cashier
and
the
looks
mighty
much
like
they
must
have
had
a
friend
around
bloomsbury
who
put
them
wise
to
those
facts
then
they
seemed
to
have
the
running
of
the
trains
down
pat
also
for
long
after
they
had
their
arrangements
made
they
just
sat
down
and
waited
until
the
freight
going
north
and
passing
bloomsbury
at
was
pounding
from
deering
crossing
and
making
all
manner
of
noise
oh
to
think
of
the
smartness
of
that
would
you
burst
out
andy
i
was
wondering
how
they
could
blow
open
the
safe
and
the
sound
of
the
explosion
never
even
be
heard
over
at
headquarters
only
half
a
block
away
but
now
i
see
how
it
could
be
done
just
like
a
fellow
says
he
can
pull
a
hair
out
of
your
head
and
you
not
feel
it
and
he
makes
out
to
give
you
a
thump
on
the
head
with
his
other
hand
at
the
same
time
so
of
course
you
never
notice
him
pulling
the
hair
just
about
on
the
same
principle
said
the
officer
nodding
for
when
that
heavy
freight
goes
pounding
past
the
station
it
makes
enough
noise
to
drown
almost
any
sort
of
sound
the
windows
rattle
and
we
always
have
to
stop
talking
until
the
caboose
gets
past
and
that
was
the
time
they
chose
to
explode
their
juice
with
an
absolute
certainty
that
no
policeman
ear
would
hear
a
single
thing
and
cadger
saw
it
all
did
he
asked
practical
frank
a
good
lot
of
it
by
twisting
his
head
from
time
to
time
replied
chief
waller
and
after
the
thing
had
been
successfully
done
he
could
watch
the
two
thieves
gathering
the
swag
together
and
putting
it
in
a
satchel
they
found
in
the
cashier
room
then
just
at
a
quarter
to
three
they
doused
the
glim
which
was
only
an
electric
torch
one
of
them
carried
and
skipped
out
locking
the
door
on
poor
cadger
it
was
hours
afterwards
when
the
day
watchman
came
on
duty
and
the
discovery
followed
frank
and
andy
had
somehow
turned
and
exchanged
a
significant
look
about
this
time
and
the
expression
of
astonishment
on
the
face
of
the
latter
deepened
did
you
say
an
electric
torch
chief
demanded
frank
immediately
yes
one
of
the
handy
kind
that
are
used
so
commonly
now
the
other
replied
tell
us
did
cadger
say
anything
about
the
thieves
wearing
masks
over
their
faces
or
did
they
use
handkerchiefs
to
hide
them
from
him
i
did
mention
that
matter
but
it
was
just
as
you
say
frank
both
men
had
on
masks
all
the
time
answered
the
police
officer
black
ones
too
i
expect
ventured
andy
that
what
they
were
but
see
here
are
you
two
just
guessing
this
or
do
you
happen
to
know
something
about
those
men
asked
the
other
quickly
for
he
could
not
help
seeing
from
the
manner
of
the
bird
boys
that
they
were
on
some
sort
of
a
scent
and
he
knew
from
past
experiences
that
their
sagacity
could
always
be
trusted
to
do
the
right
thing
well
frank
went
on
to
say
drily
while
andy
was
watching
our
new
hydroplane
out
in
the
quackenboss
pasture
i
worked
until
eleven
in
our
shop
and
then
went
home
this
morning
early
after
a
bite
to
eat
i
hurried
over
there
to
do
some
finishing
touches
and
carry
the
thing
out
to
apply
to
our
broken
plane
when
to
my
astonishment
i
found
that
the
shop
had
been
broken
into
later
in
the
night
as
well
as
our
hangar
where
the
aeroplane
is
usually
kept
and
here
what
i
discovered
lying
on
the
where
the
men
had
forgotten
them
with
these
words
he
held
up
the
flashlight
torch
and
the
twin
black
masks
and
they
produced
an
immediate
shock
upon
the
chief
of
police
and
you
found
those
things
in
your
workshop
this
morning
you
say
he
cried
reaching
out
to
take
hold
of
the
torch
and
the
bits
of
black
muslin
yes
and
whoever
was
there
they
must
have
been
mad
because
they
find
the
aeroplane
for
they
smashed
a
few
things
just
for
spite
it
looked
like
was
what
frank
added
then
if
it
was
the
same
men
who
robbed
the
bank
they
must
have
known
about
you
boys
having
a
brand
new
machine
and
say
that
must
mean
one
of
the
robbers
was
something
of
a
birdman
himself
because
no
greenhorn
would
ever
think
of
making
his
getaway
in
an
aeroplane
do
you
see
that
a
pretty
good
clue
frank
i
remember
that
when
i
getting
in
touch
with
other
points
and
find
out
if
there
any
aviator
who
gone
crooked
of
late
yes
that
worth
knowing
now
and
i
glad
you
mentioned
it
to
me
what
description
did
cadger
give
of
the
men
chief
queried
frank
oh
he
said
one
was
tall
and
thin
and
the
other
short
and
wiry
like
pretty
much
like
a
cat
i
rather
reckon
he
be
the
fellow
who
been
in
the
flying
business
seemed
to
have
a
stiff
left
arm
too
like
he
met
up
with
some
sort
of
an
accident
that
might
turn
out
to
be
a
pointer
i
just
remember
it
it
surely
was
a
lucky
thing
for
me
i
saw
you
boys
come
sailing
along
and
managed
to
attract
your
attention
i
begin
to
feel
better
already
you
gave
me
so
much
help
on
that
other
occasion
it
just
seems
as
if
i
had
to
fall
back
on
you
again
better
move
your
horse
out
of
the
way
chief
because
there
comes
a
car
at
a
racing
speed
wonder
what
the
fellows
in
it
are
thinking
about
to
take
such
chances
why
hello
look
there
frank
perhaps
you
know
the
one
who
at
the
wheel
seems
to
me
i
seen
him
before
and
that
his
name
is
percy
carberry
it
is
percy
said
frank
and
alongside
him
who
you
expect
to
see
but
his
shadow
sandy
hollingshead
and
they
look
some
excited
too
as
though
they
heard
about
the
robbery
and
the
carberry
family
was
threatened
with
bankruptcy
if
the
missing
funds
were
not
recovered
right
away
there
he
sees
us
and
is
pulling
up
i
reckon
he
looking
for
you
chief
the
car
that
had
been
tearing
along
the
pike
came
to
a
stop
close
to
where
the
head
of
the
bloomsbury
police
force
sat
in
his
buggy
percy
carberry
got
out
and
andy
could
not
but
notice
that
he
was
not
displaying
his
accustomed
agility
on
this
fine
morning
indeed
he
made
a
face
as
though
it
gave
him
a
stab
of
pain
every
time
he
took
a
step
hello
chief
waller
remarked
percy
in
his
customary
patronizing
way
ignoring
the
presence
of
the
bird
boys
completely
and
purposely
of
course
i
come
out
after
you
to
get
your
assistance
in
trying
to
find
the
rascals
who
broke
into
my
hangar
some
time
last
night
and
ran
away
with
my
biplane
upon
hearing
these
astonishing
words
it
was
little
wonder
that
andy
and
frank
once
more
looked
at
each
other
with
the
light
of
understanding
dawning
on
their
faces
chapter
vi
figuring
it
all
out
that
a
strange
story
you
telling
us
percy
said
the
head
of
the
local
police
force
at
which
the
boy
bridled
up
immediately
i
do
see
what
there
is
so
funny
about
it
chief
he
exclaimed
frowning
i
tell
you
my
hangar
was
broken
open
last
night
and
i
out
a
biplane
that
cost
me
a
good
round
sum
it
up
to
you
to
get
on
the
track
of
the
same
and
recover
it
i
hereby
offer
a
reward
of
three
hundred
dollars
for
the
recovery
of
my
machine
uninjured
and
make
it
five
hundred
if
the
thief
is
captured
in
the
bargain
when
he
said
this
percy
assumed
all
the
airs
of
a
millionaire
but
then
it
was
well
known
about
bloomsbury
that
the
widow
carberry
was
very
wealthy
also
that
her
only
hopeful
could
wheedle
her
in
to
settling
any
sort
of
a
bill
he
chose
to
contract
so
that
the
mention
of
the
sum
of
five
hundred
dollars
was
not
anything
extravagant
for
percy
oh
it
was
that
i
doubted
your
word
at
all
percy
do
think
that
chief
waller
hastened
to
say
for
like
most
men
he
was
ready
to
bow
down
in
front
of
the
golden
calf
and
more
than
once
carberry
had
been
very
generous
to
the
force
when
her
house
took
fire
and
came
near
burning
but
was
saved
thanks
to
the
energetic
work
of
police
and
fire
departments
and
again
when
a
hired
man
tried
to
carry
off
some
of
her
jewelry
but
had
been
easily
caught
and
the
plunder
restored
then
what
makes
you
act
like
that
i
like
to
know
demanded
percy
looking
very
much
put
out
as
though
he
did
not
like
to
be
treated
with
suspicion
especially
when
his
rivals
the
bird
boys
were
around
why
the
officer
went
on
to
say
when
you
said
that
about
your
aeroplane
being
taken
it
struck
me
all
in
a
heap
because
frank
here
was
just
telling
me
that
two
men
broke
into
his
shop
last
night
after
eleven
and
knocked
things
around
just
because
they
failed
to
find
his
hydroplane
in
its
bunk
as
usual
they
wanted
that
machine
and
wanted
it
so
bad
that
as
a
last
resort
they
went
over
to
your
place
and
confiscated
your
biplane
it
was
percy
turn
now
to
look
astonished
he
even
condescended
to
notice
the
presence
of
the
two
bird
boys
and
surveyed
them
with
interest
is
that
a
fact
frank
did
somebody
break
into
your
place
last
night
i
remember
now
that
i
did
see
you
pottering
about
your
craft
up
there
somewhere
about
the
quackenboss
place
but
i
forgotten
it
till
the
chief
mentioned
that
you
did
have
it
in
the
hangar
that
the
time
you
were
lucky
see
what
i
got
for
having
mine
at
home
all
snug
and
nice
it
been
hooked
clear
as
anything
and
not
a
trace
to
tell
who
did
the
business
hold
on
there
percy
said
the
chief
with
a
broad
smile
perhaps
it
is
such
a
deep
mystery
after
all
tell
me
what
you
mean
when
you
say
that
demanded
the
boy
loftily
as
though
he
resented
the
fact
that
anything
should
be
kept
from
him
a
single
second
why
frank
and
andy
found
these
things
in
their
shop
left
by
the
two
men
who
tried
to
get
their
hydroplane
and
the
chances
are
ten
to
one
the
same
parties
went
right
straight
over
to
your
place
and
got
yours
as
a
second
choice
i
do
like
the
way
you
speak
of
my
biplane
chief
which
cost
ever
so
much
more
money
than
the
contraption
the
bird
boys
own
percy
remarked
sneeringly
but
never
mind
tell
me
what
these
things
stand
for
an
electric
torch
and
why
those
things
look
like
black
masks
great
caesar
and
the
bloomsbury
bank
was
robbed
last
night
they
told
me
when
i
was
rushing
around
looking
for
you
see
here
do
you
think
the
yeggs
who
did
that
neat
job
got
away
with
my
biplane
percy
was
getting
more
excited
than
ever
now
when
he
did
he
seemed
to
just
foam
a
little
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
his
eyes
glittered
and
his
face
turned
red
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
of
it
replied
the
chief
calmly
and
yet
with
a
stiffening
of
his
figure
as
though
conscious
of
having
already
discovered
a
most
promising
clue
that
could
not
but
reflect
credit
on
his
astuteness
as
an
officer
of
the
law
they
knew
all
about
frank
machine
and
mine
too
then
continued
percy
still
grappling
with
the
tremendous
problem
looks
that
way
the
official
went
on
to
remark
and
makes
me
think
more
than
ever
that
they
must
have
a
friend
right
here
in
bloomsbury
who
put
them
wise
to
lots
of
things
time
tell
that
but
i
do
suppose
you
found
anything
around
your
place
like
frank
did
to
tell
that
some
strangers
had
been
there
while
you
slept
not
a
blessed
thing
though
to
tell
the
honest
truth
i
did
hang
around
long
when
i
found
my
biplane
was
gone
it
was
the
best
machine
i
ever
owned
and
as
you
know
i
had
several
all
told
and
inside
of
three
days
i
expected
that
the
latest
model
of
aluminum
pontoons
would
be
along
to
turn
it
into
a
water
as
well
as
an
air
craft
now
chances
are
i
never
see
it
again
because
like
as
not
nobody
knows
which
way
in
creation
they
went
we
happen
to
have
a
pointer
about
that
same
thing
andy
could
not
help
saying
though
he
hardly
liked
the
superior
air
of
the
other
not
being
able
to
overlook
such
things
as
easily
as
his
cousin
did
i
hope
then
you
give
it
to
the
chief
andy
the
carberry
boy
remarked
for
the
first
time
directly
speaking
to
one
of
the
cousins
sure
thing
we
want
to
see
the
rascals
copped
just
as
much
as
anybody
does
you
see
felix
he
the
farm
hand
up
at
quackenboss
place
and
me
we
thought
it
good
policy
to
stay
around
and
keep
an
eye
on
our
machine
while
it
was
lying
overnight
in
that
meadow
i
had
had
a
long
watch
of
it
and
was
taking
my
turn
at
sleeping
when
just
at
daybreak
felix
shook
me
and
said
there
was
a
queer
noise
up
aloft
that
kind
of
scared
him
and
which
he
rather
believed
must
come
from
some
sort
of
air
craft
oh
exclaimed
percy
looking
intensely
interested
of
course
go
on
please
i
jumped
up
and
sure
enough
i
glimpsed
a
biplane
passing
over
and
headed
up
the
lake
at
a
pretty
good
height
i
thought
it
looked
like
your
machine
but
as
i
remarked
to
frank
later
on
whoever
steered
it
had
a
different
way
about
him
from
your
method
while
i
was
wondering
what
took
you
out
so
early
and
i
could
see
there
were
two
in
the
machine
a
big
flock
of
crows
passed
over
and
i
lost
track
of
it
so
you
see
percy
broke
in
the
eager
chief
just
at
that
point
we
got
a
pretty
good
clue
already
about
the
direction
the
rascals
took
who
broke
into
the
safe
of
the
bank
and
carried
off
a
bagful
of
money
and
valuable
papers
and
then
followed
that
up
by
cribbing
your
biplane
it
was
north
they
went
up
the
lake
in
fact
and
that
the
quarter
we
have
to
look
for
them
but
let
me
tell
you
it
putting
it
pretty
hard
over
on
a
police
officer
to
make
him
try
to
track
a
stolen
flying
machine
but
you
can
get
in
touch
with
every
town
to
the
north
and
pick
up
pointers
here
and
there
percy
declared
excitedly
get
back
to
town
as
fast
as
you
can
chief
and
with
a
couple
of
your
men
i
carry
you
wherever
you
want
to
go
in
the
meanwhile
you
can
leave
orders
for
your
men
to
do
the
wiring
business
and
whenever
we
strike
a
town
we
can
ring
up
headquarters
over
the
and
learn
what
news
they
managed
to
pick
up
percy
seemed
to
think
that
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
tell
the
chief
what
he
wanted
but
then
his
plan
of
campaign
was
really
a
good
one
and
the
police
officer
was
wise
enough
not
to
quarrel
with
his
bread
and
butter
for
the
widow
carberry
was
a
large
property
owner
in
bloomsbury
you
just
take
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
seems
like
it
he
remarked
and
that
is
the
best
plan
we
could
carry
out
i
was
just
going
to
suggest
to
frank
and
andy
here
that
if
they
felt
like
taking
a
little
spin
off
to
the
northward
this
fine
morning
and
discovered
anything
suspicious
they
could
get
word
to
us
perhaps
through
the
bloomsbury
central
for
we
be
apt
to
keep
in
touch
with
home
percy
did
not
know
whether
to
look
pleased
at
this
suggestion
or
not
it
would
be
just
like
the
everlasting
luck
of
the
bird
boys
to
make
another
remarkable
success
out
of
this
thing
for
they
seemed
to
have
a
failing
that
way
while
all
the
hard
fortune
came
in
his
direction
that
would
give
him
a
pain
to
be
sure
for
he
was
horribly
envious
of
their
local
fame
as
successful
aviators
but
at
the
same
time
he
hated
to
lose
that
beautiful
biplane
which
he
had
not
owned
very
long
and
which
had
taken
his
heart
by
storm
so
percy
finally
compromised
as
he
frequently
did
he
even
forced
a
grim
smile
to
appear
upon
his
face
though
it
did
not
deceive
frank
in
the
least
and
as
for
andy
he
never
took
the
least
stock
in
percy
carberry
honesty
in
his
mind
there
was
always
a
deep
meaning
underneath
every
action
of
the
other
why
sure
i
hope
frank
will
discover
the
thieves
and
recover
the
stuff
they
grabbed
from
the
bank
also
that
he
have
the
good
luck
to
get
back
my
biplane
without
its
being
badly
wrecked
that
reward
is
worth
trying
for
and
i
do
go
back
on
my
word
all
the
same
he
knew
very
well
that
neither
of
the
bird
boys
could
be
forced
to
ever
accept
one
penny
from
his
hand
no
matter
what
good
dame
fortune
allowed
them
to
do
for
him
andy
was
watching
keenly
when
the
carberry
boy
walked
back
to
his
machine
and
climbed
into
the
steering
seat
frank
happening
to
look
that
way
saw
his
cousin
face
lighted
up
as
if
in
glee
and
he
even
heard
him
chuckle
perhaps
percy
may
have
caught
the
same
sound
for
he
turned
his
head
after
dropping
down
into
his
seat
and
scowled
darkly
at
andy
there
is
nothing
like
a
guilty
conscience
to
bring
about
a
and
somehow
percy
seemed
to
know
what
the
bird
boy
was
thinking
about
just
then
at
any
rate
he
was
an
adept
at
the
pilot
wheel
of
a
car
though
inclined
to
be
a
reckless
driver
just
as
he
was
also
a
daring
air
voyager
taking
desperate
chances
that
promised
to
bring
him
to
grief
one
of
these
days
backing
the
car
swiftly
around
he
sped
away
sandy
hollingshead
who
had
not
once
moved
from
his
seat
or
uttered
a
single
word
all
the
time
turned
his
head
to
look
back
and
andy
thought
he
too
scowled
darkly
as
though
stirred
by
unpleasant
thoughts
but
in
another
minute
they
had
vanished
around
the
bend
far
along
the
pike
and
the
chief
alone
was
seen
whipping
up
his
nag
in
the
endeavor
to
get
back
as
speedily
as
possible
to
headquarters
well
of
all
things
do
this
just
take
the
cake
remarked
andy
when
he
and
his
cousin
once
more
found
themselves
alone
beside
the
motionless
aeroplane
that
nestled
like
a
great
bird
on
the
grass
close
to
the
road
it
certainly
looks
as
though
we
might
be
in
for
a
little
more
excitement
replied
frank
but
what
seemed
to
make
you
chuckle
so
much
andy
you
must
have
noticed
something
that
escaped
my
attention
because
i
was
busy
thinking
of
other
things
suppose
you
open
up
and
tell
me
i
was
tickled
half
to
death
to
see
how
percy
tried
to
walk
as
if
nothing
was
the
matter
with
him
when
all
the
time
he
could
keep
from
limping
because
do
you
see
one
or
several
of
those
felix
scattered
around
last
night
must
have
stung
him
about
the
legs
why
he
scowled
so
at
me
frank
chapter
vii
the
air
scouts
frank
laughed
a
little
himself
when
he
heard
his
cousin
say
this
i
give
you
credit
for
getting
one
on
me
there
andy
he
declared
then
you
believe
i
hit
the
right
nail
on
the
head
do
you
frank
well
remarked
the
other
come
to
think
of
it
percy
did
have
a
little
limp
and
i
guess
he
tried
to
hide
it
the
best
he
could
for
i
remember
seeing
him
wince
several
times
but
how
about
sandy
who
never
tried
to
get
out
of
the
car
once
and
did
even
open
his
lips
to
say
a
single
word
i
bet
you
he
got
a
double
dose
and
is
pretty
sore
this
morning
andy
went
on
you
seemed
to
think
it
was
kind
of
hard
lines
for
felix
to
give
a
load
when
they
were
pretty
far
off
and
just
climbing
over
that
fence
but
it
tickles
me
every
time
i
think
of
it
seemed
like
the
whole
bunch
just
fell
over
after
he
shot
and
like
as
not
each
fellow
got
his
share
of
the
number
eights
somewhere
in
his
legs
but
how
about
this
job
the
chief
asked
us
to
engineer
frank
are
we
going
to
start
off
on
that
little
spin
up
the
lake
and
d
guess
we
could
get
a
pointer
about
where
the
two
thieves
have
gone
we
might
try
anyhow
no
harm
in
that
was
his
cousin
reply
as
he
turned
once
more
toward
the
hydroplane
that
lay
near
by
i
remember
we
had
great
luck
that
other
time
when
we
discovered
that
the
men
who
broke
into
leffingwell
place
were
hiding
in
that
old
cabin
up
in
the
woods
perhaps
the
same
story
might
be
repeated
who
knows
they
call
it
the
bird
boys
luck
frank
but
then
we
work
for
all
we
get
and
ought
to
have
a
little
credit
when
we
win
out
if
we
made
a
bad
job
of
things
the
same
people
would
be
quick
to
say
we
did
know
our
business
shall
we
go
back
to
the
shop
first
that
would
be
the
only
way
replied
frank
if
we
going
to
take
on
this
dangerous
job
of
looking
up
yeggmen
who
have
broken
into
a
bank
and
looted
it
why
it
seems
to
me
we
ought
to
make
a
little
preparation
of
course
about
all
we
expect
to
do
is
to
scout
around
and
see
if
we
can
pick
up
any
information
with
the
aid
of
our
marine
glasses
it
hardly
to
be
expected
that
two
boys
would
take
the
chance
of
trying
to
nab
a
couple
of
reckless
thieves
who
must
be
armed
and
desperate
but
if
the
opening
came
frank
we
would
let
it
slip
by
would
we
asked
andy
always
willing
to
go
to
the
limit
when
temptation
beckoned
perhaps
not
answered
the
other
smilingly
but
there
no
use
crossing
a
bridge
till
we
come
to
it
so
we
wo
bother
any
more
about
that
get
aboard
andy
and
we
head
for
home
again
just
think
of
all
that
happened
since
we
had
that
little
accident
yesterday
afternoon
up
near
the
quackenboss
place
andy
went
on
to
say
as
he
complied
with
his
cousin
request
and
settled
himself
in
his
seat
leaving
the
piloting
of
the
machine
to
frank
there
has
been
quite
a
little
run
of
excitement
that
a
fact
mused
the
other
first
the
accident
and
our
great
good
luck
in
making
a
landing
without
breaking
a
thing
including
our
precious
necks
then
the
discovery
of
percy
and
sandy
looking
at
the
hydroplane
lying
there
and
hurrying
away
as
if
they
had
already
laid
a
plan
to
come
back
and
pay
a
night
visit
if
they
failed
to
see
us
get
home
by
daylight
andy
went
on
to
add
events
followed
thick
and
fast
after
that
andy
the
coming
of
the
four
fellows
with
their
faces
hidden
their
repulse
at
the
hands
of
yourself
and
the
friendly
felix
then
the
robbery
of
the
bank
the
breaking
into
our
shop
by
men
who
left
their
cards
behind
in
the
shape
of
these
burglar
tools
the
meeting
of
the
chief
on
the
road
and
the
news
he
gave
us
and
last
of
all
the
coming
of
percy
with
the
startling
news
that
his
biplane
had
been
stolen
yes
but
do
forget
my
seeing
it
sailing
over
just
at
early
dawn
remarked
the
other
as
frank
stooped
forward
for
a
last
look
around
before
starting
up
the
powerful
little
kinkaid
engine
because
that
promises
to
play
quite
a
figure
in
the
pursuit
of
the
smart
thieves
though
they
may
be
fifty
miles
away
from
here
by
now
if
they
know
how
to
handle
that
fine
biplane
right
hold
tight
we
off
warned
frank
as
he
applied
the
power
for
the
new
engine
was
of
course
a
and
could
be
operated
from
his
seat
with
almost
as
much
ease
as
might
be
shown
in
using
electricity
and
pressing
the
button
the
hydroplane
ran
easily
along
the
ground
for
the
bicycle
wheels
were
always
kept
in
first
class
condition
and
as
the
speed
kept
on
increasing
frank
soon
uptilted
the
plane
and
like
a
great
bird
rising
from
the
ground
with
a
graceful
sweep
the
flying
machine
took
to
the
air
long
practice
had
made
the
bird
boys
familiar
with
every
movement
connected
with
the
actions
of
an
aeroplane
but
at
the
same
time
they
tried
to
be
always
on
their
guard
against
being
incautious
that
is
the
trouble
with
most
aviators
they
grow
so
familiar
with
danger
that
they
forget
the
terrible
risk
that
always
hangs
over
the
head
of
every
one
who
soars
aloft
in
his
frail
airship
and
then
when
finally
something
happens
after
they
have
become
too
reckless
they
never
get
another
chance
sweeping
along
not
more
than
three
hundred
feet
above
the
ground
the
boys
were
home
in
almost
no
time
they
could
see
the
car
containing
percy
carberry
and
his
crony
sandy
just
vanishing
among
the
houses
of
bloomsbury
and
the
chief
about
there
waved
his
hat
at
them
as
they
sped
past
him
then
the
aeroplane
dropped
lightly
down
close
to
the
hangar
back
of
the
bird
home
where
andy
and
his
father
the
professor
lived
together
with
old
colonel
whympers
the
veteran
who
used
crutches
or
a
cane
on
account
of
his
rheumatism
brought
on
he
always
declared
not
by
age
oh
no
but
the
wounds
he
received
many
years
ago
when
he
was
fighting
for
his
country
in
the
great
civil
war
he
was
sitting
there
on
a
pile
of
lumber
waiting
for
them
a
quaint
old
fellow
who
was
greatly
beloved
by
both
cousins
and
who
believed
firmly
that
some
fine
day
andy
bird
was
bound
to
even
eclipse
the
fame
which
his
father
had
gained
in
the
field
of
science
and
aviation
it
happened
that
the
professor
was
away
at
the
time
delivering
a
series
of
lectures
before
some
body
of
scientists
in
a
distant
city
and
whenever
the
boys
were
in
their
shop
the
old
veteran
was
in
the
habit
of
coming
around
to
see
what
new
and
wonderful
things
engaged
their
attention
as
well
as
chatting
with
them
and
he
was
as
welcome
as
the
sun
in
may
of
course
just
then
he
was
bristling
with
questions
as
a
hedgehog
would
be
with
quills
and
knowing
the
colonel
of
old
frank
and
andy
lost
no
time
in
telling
him
all
that
had
happened
to
them
from
the
time
of
their
little
accident
down
to
when
they
heard
the
latest
news
from
percy
carberry
and
i
warrant
now
remarked
colonel
whimpers
as
soon
as
the
tale
was
finished
that
you
two
boys
get
the
first
clew
to
where
the
robbers
are
hiding
did
you
beat
the
wonderful
chief
out
before
and
history
have
a
habit
of
repeating
itself
oh
if
only
i
was
ten
years
younger
how
i
love
to
be
along
when
all
these
glorious
things
are
happening
i
hate
to
think
i
put
by
on
the
shelf
and
never
can
be
any
good
again
that
was
the
old
man
only
fault
he
was
forever
complaining
because
his
day
for
indulging
in
exciting
scenes
had
passed
but
any
one
who
knew
the
half
that
he
had
passed
through
would
think
the
colonel
had
no
reason
to
say
anything
and
that
it
was
only
right
that
someone
else
had
a
show
they
soon
soothed
him
however
and
long
practice
had
made
andy
particularly
apt
at
this
sort
of
thing
here
come
elephant
and
larry
on
the
run
remarked
frank
a
little
while
later
i
wonder
if
they
saw
us
come
home
and
whether
they
can
have
picked
up
any
additional
news
connected
with
the
bank
robbery
that
we
ought
know
well
it
might
pay
us
to
hold
up
a
little
and
see
added
andy
yes
since
we
in
no
great
hurry
and
the
day
is
long
frank
remarked
the
two
boys
came
up
panting
for
breath
larry
had
evidently
set
the
pace
and
it
was
a
matter
of
the
smaller
lad
keeping
with
him
or
else
being
left
behind
something
elephant
never
liked
to
have
happen
so
that
he
was
unable
to
say
even
a
single
word
for
a
full
minute
after
arriving
alongside
the
hangar
tell
us
have
they
learned
anything
new
since
the
chief
started
off
asked
frank
as
usual
right
to
the
point
and
in
this
way
cutting
off
the
myriad
of
questions
which
he
knew
both
the
newcomers
were
primed
to
ask
why
yes
gasped
larry
while
elephant
nodded
his
head
as
if
to
say
he
agreed
to
all
that
was
said
after
percy
came
bustling
around
asking
for
the
chief
and
telling
how
somebody
had
busted
into
his
place
and
run
off
with
his
biplane
in
the
night
they
got
to
talking
it
over
and
wondering
if
it
could
have
been
the
robbers
and
if
one
of
knew
how
to
handle
such
things
so
they
called
up
the
city
and
asked
questions
in
that
way
they
learned
that
there
was
a
yegg
who
had
been
suspected
of
having
been
connected
with
several
other
jobs
though
they
never
could
just
put
the
kibosh
on
him
and
his
name
is
casper
blue
and
one
time
he
used
to
be
an
actor
and
then
became
a
pretty
flier
but
in
an
accident
he
broke
his
arm
and
had
to
give
up
his
business
he
was
always
a
crooked
sort
of
feller
and
after
that
just
boozed
around
joined
in
with
hobo
gangs
and
they
believe
touched
up
a
few
jobs
himself
there
that
all
we
know
and
now
what
you
been
doing
too
long
a
story
to
tell
just
now
declared
frank
the
colonel
knows
and
perhaps
he
amuse
you
after
we
gone
oh
say
are
you
meanin
to
take
after
them
fellers
that
busted
the
bank
safe
and
then
got
away
with
percy
biplane
asked
elephant
eagerly
do
i
wish
though
i
could
just
hang
on
behind
and
be
in
the
swim
for
once
you
two
seem
to
have
about
all
the
fun
there
is
going
hang
the
luck
say
i
well
you
better
not
try
it
that
what
said
andy
shaking
his
head
threateningly
at
the
bare
suggestion
of
having
elephant
aboard
when
they
made
a
start
i
think
we
got
everything
now
andy
remarked
frank
anxious
to
be
off
hope
you
taking
guns
along
because
if
you
do
run
across
them
hobo
fellers
you
be
apt
to
need
them
right
bad
larry
went
on
to
say
also
looking
downcast
at
having
to
miss
all
the
sport
simply
because
nature
had
never
intended
him
for
an
aviator
as
he
was
inclined
to
get
dizzy
when
looking
down
from
any
height
oh
frank
provided
for
that
and
besides
we
do
really
expect
to
round
the
thieves
up
just
find
out
if
they
dropped
down
anywhere
inside
of
thirty
miles
to
the
north
of
bloomsbury
shall
i
get
aboard
frank
yes
and
after
we
off
larry
will
you
and
elephant
do
me
the
favor
to
step
around
to
my
house
and
tell
my
folks
that
the
bird
boys
have
hired
out
as
scouts
to
chief
waller
tell
dad
that
we
be
mighty
careful
and
for
mother
not
to
worry
about
us
you
know
i
always
call
aunt
laura
mother
because
she
been
that
ever
since
my
own
died
years
ago
will
you
do
that
boys
and
frank
sitting
there
ready
to
start
turned
a
smiling
face
upon
his
two
friends
even
as
they
promised
the
aeroplane
started
off
and
a
minute
later
soared
up
in
the
air
like
a
bird
rejoicing
at
its
freedom
for
leaving
the
earth
behind
chapter
viii
just
below
the
clouds
good
luck
to
you
boys
came
floating
up
from
the
ground
above
the
buzzing
of
the
busy
little
kinkaid
motor
and
looking
down
they
could
see
larry
elephant
yes
and
the
old
veteran
also
carrying
on
excitedly
as
they
swung
their
hats
around
who
you
waving
your
handkerchief
to
frank
does
your
best
girl
keep
her
eyes
on
the
skies
all
the
day
long
looking
to
see
you
come
around
demanded
andy
humorously
yes
that
my
best
girl
as
sure
as
you
live
and
she
standing
there
on
the
porch
of
our
house
right
now
waving
to
me
aunt
laura
who
thinks
just
as
much
of
me
as
any
mother
could
but
andy
neither
of
us
said
anything
when
larry
told
about
that
hobo
aviator
named
casper
blue
yet
he
answered
the
description
the
bank
watchman
gave
of
the
smaller
man
who
had
a
stiff
arm
oh
i
noticed
that
all
right
even
if
i
did
look
your
way
returned
andy
promptly
it
sort
of
clinched
the
nail
we
drove
through
did
it
frank
seems
like
it
the
other
went
on
to
remark
and
the
chances
are
ten
to
one
we
got
the
story
down
fine
right
now
know
who
one
of
the
robbers
was
why
they
wanted
to
steal
an
aeroplane
to
make
their
in
and
all
that
but
there
are
a
few
things
we
do
know
that
throw
a
little
more
light
on
the
affair
as
what
queried
his
cousin
well
for
one
thing
the
chief
seemed
to
think
the
thieves
might
have
had
inside
information
they
seemed
to
know
so
much
about
things
connected
with
the
bank
our
having
an
aeroplane
where
we
lived
what
our
habits
were
and
then
about
percy
biplane
in
the
bargain
now
that
something
serious
if
there
a
man
in
bloomsbury
who
in
league
with
such
rascals
he
be
apt
to
help
them
out
again
later
on
if
they
get
away
with
this
job
and
he
ought
to
be
found
out
whew
looks
like
we
got
a
big
job
on
our
hands
if
we
hope
to
do
all
that
sort
of
thing
commented
andy
with
a
whistle
to
indicate
his
feelings
nobody
said
we
even
think
of
trying
laughed
frank
as
he
stopped
mounting
upward
in
spirals
and
headed
away
toward
the
north
it
was
a
glorious
view
that
they
had
now
spread
out
beneath
and
around
them
neither
of
the
bird
boys
ever
tired
of
such
wonderful
sights
and
although
by
now
it
had
become
an
old
story
they
enjoyed
it
as
much
as
ever
even
if
their
former
sensation
of
awe
had
given
way
to
one
of
familiarity
they
could
see
the
entire
outlines
of
beautiful
lake
sunrise
with
its
many
coves
and
points
jutting
out
the
water
glistening
in
the
sunlight
as
the
morning
breeze
fanned
it
gently
why
yes
there
was
the
little
lake
steamboat
called
the
mermaid
passing
along
the
northern
border
of
the
lake
on
the
way
between
the
town
of
cranford
on
the
shore
opposite
bloomsbury
and
headed
toward
a
small
lumbering
camp
far
up
the
left
bank
possibly
to
deliver
supplies
after
which
she
would
point
her
nose
down
toward
the
home
town
which
was
of
more
importance
than
any
other
station
on
lake
sunrise
the
boys
did
look
back
dear
though
the
scenes
around
home
must
ever
be
for
them
it
was
characteristic
of
these
lads
that
once
they
put
their
shoulder
to
the
wheel
or
in
other
words
their
hand
to
the
plow
they
would
not
allow
themselves
to
be
discouraged
by
thoughts
of
the
home
ties
that
accounted
for
much
of
the
success
that
had
been
their
portion
in
the
past
they
could
for
the
time
being
forget
that
there
was
any
such
place
as
home
and
in
this
way
they
avoided
the
weakness
that
such
thoughts
are
apt
to
bring
along
in
their
train
forward
their
way
lay
toward
those
forbidding
wilds
far
to
the
north
where
few
towns
could
be
found
and
pretty
much
all
the
country
was
a
vast
wilderness
filled
with
picturesque
forests
wild
swamps
and
rugged
hills
it
was
just
the
country
where
desperate
law
breakers
would
choose
as
a
after
they
had
committed
some
crime
and
expected
a
warm
pursuit
ordinary
methods
would
never
find
them
save
through
a
mere
chance
but
when
one
can
copy
the
eagle
and
mount
to
dizzy
heights
with
a
pair
of
powerful
glasses
he
can
see
almost
everything
that
is
going
on
for
miles
and
miles
around
provided
he
has
a
skilled
companion
along
to
manage
the
aeroplane
or
balloon
and
that
is
destined
to
be
the
greatest
value
of
these
winged
messengers
in
future
years
since
it
has
been
proven
that
they
are
not
so
very
dangerous
after
all
in
the
line
of
dropping
explosives
upon
battleships
or
fortified
places
somewhere
up
yonder
frank
they
are
probably
hiding
and
feeling
perfectly
safe
from
pursuit
ventured
andy
who
was
sweeping
the
marine
glasses
around
and
examining
the
country
ahead
with
more
than
common
interest
look
how
old
stands
out
today
remarked
frank
turning
for
just
an
instant
to
glance
upward
toward
the
left
where
the
high
mountain
towered
its
heavily
wooded
sides
looking
as
gloomy
as
ever
and
the
white
cliffs
that
made
the
summit
inaccessible
to
human
feet
appearing
almost
dazzling
in
the
glittering
light
of
the
undimmed
morning
sun
and
say
there
our
old
friends
the
eagles
that
had
a
nest
up
there
and
gave
me
such
a
warm
time
when
we
first
reached
the
top
andy
cried
as
he
focused
his
glasses
on
a
sweeping
pair
of
huge
birds
that
were
heading
their
way
as
if
meaning
to
investigate
and
find
out
what
manner
of
rival
this
could
be
invading
their
native
element
they
know
too
much
to
bother
with
an
aeroplane
by
now
declared
frank
laughing
again
why
i
thinking
those
birds
have
hardly
grown
new
feathers
in
place
of
the
lot
they
lost
that
time
they
fought
us
so
savagely
the
memory
appeared
to
amuse
his
cousin
also
for
he
could
be
heard
laughing
heartily
even
above
the
purr
of
the
now
steadily
going
motor
that
sent
the
propellers
whizzing
around
so
rapidly
for
there
was
one
fore
and
aft
as
is
the
case
with
all
biplanes
the
engine
being
behind
the
pilot
and
his
companion
tell
me
if
you
can
remember
was
that
other
aeroplane
headed
straight
up
the
lake
the
last
you
saw
it
in
the
early
morning
light
frank
asked
that
right
frank
but
then
i
could
say
just
how
long
they
kept
along
that
same
course
when
those
hundreds
of
old
crows
came
sailing
along
on
the
wind
cawing
to
beat
the
band
and
going
i
lost
sight
of
the
biplane
after
that
it
would
have
to
be
just
guess
work
but
we
got
a
good
pointer
to
start
with
insisted
frank
they
would
be
so
apt
to
head
toward
the
south
east
or
west
because
in
those
directions
there
are
plenty
of
towns
and
villages
and
these
could
report
seeing
a
strange
biplane
passing
over
so
giving
the
police
a
clue
no
chances
are
ten
to
one
they
kept
right
on
toward
the
north
and
there
where
we
got
to
do
all
our
searching
today
we
can
just
comb
the
whole
district
over
and
anything
that
looks
like
the
stolen
aeroplane
is
sure
to
catch
our
attention
from
this
height
do
you
think
so
andy
i
reckon
it
will
frank
but
the
only
thing
bothers
me
is
that
things
may
have
worked
all
right
with
the
rascals
and
by
now
they
away
off
so
far
distant
that
we
never
in
the
wide
world
get
in
touch
with
them
the
more
the
pity
well
it
never
been
a
habit
of
ours
to
own
up
beaten
till
we
done
everything
under
the
sun
to
win
out
and
andy
we
only
started
as
yet
the
field
is
before
us
you
know
with
a
whole
day
supply
of
gas
to
push
us
on
if
we
want
to
keep
going
so
i
not
asking
any
favors
and
expect
to
do
just
my
level
best
to
find
out
where
the
bank
robbers
have
gone
and
if
we
hunt
around
a
whole
lot
without
getting
tabs
on
the
pair
why
we
can
drop
down
somewhere
in
a
town
and
get
in
touch
with
bloomsbury
headquarters
the
chief
as
much
as
promised
that
he
leave
word
there
to
put
us
wise
to
anything
that
had
been
learned
by
way
of
the
telephone
from
other
places
and
given
a
clue
in
that
way
we
might
take
a
fresh
spurt
you
know
just
so
andy
agreed
the
other
bending
his
head
to
watch
how
some
part
of
the
machinery
was
doing
its
duty
for
that
is
always
the
weak
link
in
modern
aviation
nearly
everything
depending
on
the
engine
fulfilling
its
part
perfectly
andy
continued
to
make
use
of
the
pair
of
glasses
that
magnified
objects
in
the
far
distance
so
wonderfully
that
a
man
could
have
been
recognized
easily
a
mile
away
and
perhaps
much
further
if
the
air
were
real
clear
now
and
then
he
turned
them
to
the
right
the
beautiful
lake
always
attracted
him
very
much
like
a
magnet
would
whenever
he
had
a
chance
to
look
out
over
its
glistening
bosom
and
there
was
the
little
steamer
just
as
frank
had
said
why
he
could
even
distinguish
todd
pemberton
up
in
the
pilothouse
grasping
his
wheel
and
guiding
his
charge
among
the
shoals
that
were
charted
in
the
northern
end
of
the
lake
as
dangerous
that
is
for
green
hands
at
the
tiller
or
wheel
of
a
boat
propelled
by
sails
steam
or
gasolene
they
were
moving
in
a
line
that
would
carry
them
up
along
the
shore
and
consequently
every
minute
they
drew
nearer
the
small
lake
steamer
that
was
heading
toward
them
passengers
could
be
seen
on
its
deck
and
possibly
every
eye
was
glued
just
at
that
particular
moment
on
the
aeroplane
that
was
buzzing
go
steadily
northward
perhaps
it
might
have
been
the
first
time
some
of
these
people
had
ever
seen
such
an
interesting
object
but
in
the
region
around
bloomsbury
it
was
by
now
a
common
sight
with
such
enterprising
young
air
pilots
as
the
bird
boys
and
percy
carberry
in
the
field
almost
every
decent
day
all
at
once
frank
was
heard
to
utter
an
exclamation
turn
your
glasses
straight
ahead
and
see
what
that
can
be
fluttering
among
the
bushes
at
norton
point
andy
he
called
out
hastily
when
the
other
had
swung
around
and
covered
the
region
spoken
of
he
quickly
gave
the
desired
information
somebody
seems
to
be
shaking
a
handkerchief
or
something
else
white
he
observed
and
it
do
look
like
just
waving
at
the
steamer
either
for
they
do
it
after
a
system
as
we
would
signal
with
wigwag
flags
there
i
counted
seven
times
he
did
it
then
comes
a
halt
and
one
two
three
times
another
halt
and
once
more
he
starts
in
this
time
three
four
five
and
then
stops
now
what
do
you
suppose
the
fellow
means
by
that
and
who
can
he
be
waving
to
frank
you
expect
it
might
be
some
one
out
on
the
lake
can
you
see
any
small
boat
in
sight
andy
or
any
one
waving
back
from
another
point
not
a
thing
as
far
as
i
can
see
replied
the
boy
with
the
marine
glasses
suppose
you
try
the
steamer
then
suggested
frank
meaningly
immediately
andy
gave
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
i
see
a
signal
moving
frank
and
it
seems
to
be
copying
the
one
on
shore
he
hastened
to
remark
excitedly
where
does
it
come
from
the
passengers
that
i
saw
pushing
up
against
the
rail
and
staring
at
us
are
any
of
them
interested
do
you
think
continued
frank
who
just
then
could
not
turn
his
head
to
look
but
must
depend
on
his
chum
well
no
answered
andy
it
seems
to
come
from
the
pilothouse
and
must
be
todd
pemberton
himself
chapter
ix
the
pilot
of
the
mermaid
so
it
todd
pemberton
is
it
remarked
frank
i
think
it
pay
us
to
slow
down
a
little
and
look
into
this
white
business
goodness
gracious
you
ca
be
thinking
that
todd
is
in
touch
with
the
bank
robbers
can
you
frank
andy
exclaimed
astounded
apparently
at
the
very
thought
of
such
a
thing
oh
i
not
up
to
that
point
of
saying
anything
yet
but
all
the
same
it
what
i
call
interesting
you
know
the
other
replied
and
from
this
andy
could
easily
guess
that
while
frank
might
have
notions
about
the
matter
he
did
not
care
to
commit
himself
so
early
in
the
game
yes
that
so
andy
replied
still
having
his
eyes
glued
to
the
binoculars
what
doing
now
continued
frank
nothing
that
i
see
replied
the
other
no
more
white
handkerchiefs
waving
around
the
point
eh
andy
not
a
blessed
thing
and
todd
quit
too
guess
they
come
to
some
sort
of
an
understanding
wish
i
knew
what
seven
three
five
meant
something
pretty
interesting
i
be
bound
andy
went
on
to
mutter
half
to
himself
well
we
can
only
guess
and
that
the
extent
of
it
frank
was
saying
in
a
rather
serious
tone
as
though
he
believed
there
might
be
more
in
connection
with
the
little
affair
than
a
mere
exchange
of
civilities
how
about
todd
pemberton
frank
asked
the
boy
with
the
glasses
well
you
know
him
as
well
as
i
do
perhaps
better
returned
his
cousin
i
mean
was
there
once
something
against
him
i
know
frank
that
my
guardian
signed
a
paper
about
getting
todd
his
position
with
the
steamboat
company
this
last
spring
they
always
get
him
to
sign
everything
going
he
so
and
what
you
call
an
easy
mark
yes
they
came
to
my
father
too
and
he
put
his
name
down
i
remember
as
near
as
i
can
say
it
was
a
petition
to
ask
the
company
to
give
todd
the
position
of
pilot
and
stated
the
belief
of
all
those
who
signed
that
he
would
make
good
he
used
to
be
a
pilot
on
lake
sunrise
and
before
that
on
one
of
the
great
lakes
but
frank
why
the
petition
if
he
was
able
to
fill
the
place
think
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
make
application
and
then
jump
in
well
it
seemed
to
be
pretty
generally
known
about
bloomsbury
that
todd
had
not
always
been
as
straight
as
he
is
today
and
lots
of
people
believed
he
would
never
hold
his
place
a
week
but
he
had
it
all
summer
now
and
seems
to
be
giving
satisfaction
all
right
frank
went
on
to
say
but
there
was
a
past
you
mean
todd
had
gone
the
pace
and
used
to
drink
and
gamble
i
suppose
perhaps
now
he
even
used
to
herd
with
a
tough
set
how
about
that
frank
it
so
all
right
todd
got
down
pretty
low
and
was
even
a
hobo
i
heard
before
he
took
a
brace
and
came
back
to
bloomsbury
to
make
a
man
of
himself
again
gee
i
real
sorry
to
hear
that
andy
muttered
what
that
he
reformed
demanded
the
cousin
in
pretended
surprise
shucks
no
but
about
his
having
been
a
tramp
because
do
you
see
frank
it
makes
things
look
black
for
todd
remember
do
you
about
what
the
chief
said
when
he
spoke
of
the
yeggs
knowing
so
much
about
things
that
he
thought
they
must
have
had
inside
information
and
that
somebody
familiar
with
bloomsbury
ways
helped
them
figure
it
all
out
looks
bad
for
todd
that
what
frank
to
hear
andy
talk
you
would
think
that
the
party
in
question
must
have
been
a
personal
friend
at
least
when
in
truth
he
only
knew
todd
pemberton
to
speak
to
as
he
did
a
thousand
other
people
in
and
around
the
home
town
by
that
you
mean
you
afraid
he
fallen
in
with
some
old
companions
in
crime
and
been
tempted
or
forced
to
join
them
in
this
raid
on
the
bank
was
the
way
frank
put
the
matter
direct
you
covered
what
i
do
believe
as
sure
as
my
name
andy
bird
well
let
me
say
that
i
think
the
same
way
you
do
frank
went
on
to
remark
good
cried
andy
in
a
delighted
tone
sometimes
we
agree
and
again
we
have
different
minds
but
in
this
case
it
looks
like
we
might
be
on
the
same
raft
take
another
good
squint
at
the
point
andy
and
see
if
you
can
pick
up
that
man
again
the
fellow
who
was
doing
all
that
tall
wigwagging
i
looking
frank
what
d
see
there
now
the
other
continued
nothing
that
is
there
are
stones
and
moss
and
trees
and
perhaps
birds
flying
around
this
way
and
that
but
never
the
first
sign
of
a
human
being
can
i
discover
anywhere
frank
still
we
know
there
one
man
there
at
least
perhaps
a
pair
of
them
hiding
somewhere
around
that
desolate
place
why
norton
point
is
i
guess
about
the
meanest
and
loneliest
place
of
all
the
disston
swamp
lumber
company
nobody
hardly
ever
goes
there
except
to
shoot
snipe
and
woodcock
in
the
fall
and
yet
we
happen
to
know
there
one
person
hiding
out
there
and
that
he
knows
todd
pemberton
for
they
been
exchanging
signals
through
the
wigwag
code
looks
suspicious
frank
do
you
think
looks
like
it
might
pay
to
investigate
a
little
closer
andy
they
were
by
this
time
passing
over
the
identical
strip
of
country
where
andy
had
watched
the
signal
waving
by
looking
almost
directly
down
he
could
see
between
the
tall
trees
as
only
an
aviator
ever
has
a
chance
of
doing
you
know
what
i
hoping
to
discover
frank
he
remarked
as
he
continued
to
scan
every
part
that
was
at
all
exposed
by
openings
among
the
trees
percy
lost
biplane
i
take
it
came
the
prompt
reply
yes
because
they
could
very
well
have
landed
without
a
certain
amount
of
open
space
we
know
how
hard
it
is
to
drop
into
a
hole
and
worse
still
to
climb
up
out
of
one
did
we
have
the
toughest
of
times
down
there
in
that
south
american
forest
finding
open
spots
where
we
could
land
with
some
chance
of
ever
getting
out
again
without
cutting
trees
down
that
were
as
big
around
as
a
young
house
but
i
do
hear
you
shouting
out
that
you
made
any
sort
of
discovery
up
to
now
andy
well
no
for
a
fact
i
have
but
frank
i
wish
you
could
take
the
glass
and
let
me
hold
the
wheel
for
a
minute
you
can
tell
me
just
as
well
i
think
replied
the
other
it
about
the
sandy
beach
in
front
of
the
point
remarked
andy
what
ails
it
then
frank
inquired
seeing
his
cousin
hesitate
why
andy
went
on
to
say
you
know
how
powerful
this
glass
is
and
how
it
shows
up
the
smallest
of
things
when
the
sun
is
just
right
doing
that
now
i
can
look
down
on
the
sand
spit
at
the
point
and
for
a
lonely
spot
where
hardly
a
man
ever
comes
from
november
to
june
it
looks
pretty
well
trampled
up
to
me
trampled
by
men
or
animals
the
pilot
inquired
i
think
by
animals
answered
the
one
who
held
the
powerful
lenses
to
his
young
eyes
and
it
struck
me
that
perhaps
the
biplane
came
down
right
there
early
this
morning
it
was
headed
this
way
when
i
saw
it
and
not
so
very
high
up
though
that
flock
of
crazy
crows
knocked
me
out
of
watching
it
for
some
times
do
you
mean
it
fell
there
that
they
had
an
accident
of
some
kind
andy
might
be
that
and
then
again
perhaps
they
dropped
down
on
purpose
they
mean
to
have
another
warm
session
around
bloomsbury
before
skipping
out
of
this
section
for
good
with
the
aeroplane
to
make
a
quick
they
might
think
of
some
rich
haul
they
want
to
gather
in
am
i
away
off
in
my
guess
frank
or
do
you
kind
of
lean
the
same
way
i
think
you
are
getting
pretty
close
to
the
truth
andy
and
that
a
fact
replied
the
other
but
it
would
clinch
it
if
you
could
only
glimpse
the
biplane
hidden
away
somewhere
down
there
under
the
brush
or
the
trees
that
what
i
been
hoping
for
returned
andy
a
little
fretfully
but
so
far
without
meeting
any
success
that
you
could
notice
but
what
ought
we
to
do
about
it
frank
go
on
and
take
a
wide
sweep
around
came
the
steady
reply
perhaps
we
might
run
across
another
leading
clue
and
then
this
one
would
look
foolish
we
be
sorry
then
that
we
thought
so
bad
of
todd
perhaps
after
all
he
was
only
making
signals
to
one
of
the
men
connected
with
the
logging
camp
up
on
the
point
for
something
or
other
he
allowed
the
motor
to
work
at
the
reduced
speed
that
it
had
been
carrying
on
ever
since
quitting
the
home
field
where
the
workshop
and
the
hangar
stood
andy
still
continued
to
use
the
glasses
as
though
he
had
not
quite
given
up
all
hope
of
making
some
sort
of
discovery
once
however
they
had
left
the
northern
end
of
the
lovely
lake
behind
them
for
good
and
only
the
forest
lay
below
frank
quickened
matters
somewhat
truth
to
tell
he
hardly
knew
what
to
think
and
whether
what
they
had
witnessed
could
really
have
any
bearing
on
the
solution
of
the
puzzle
or
not
certainly
if
the
hunt
was
only
kept
up
in
automobiles
that
required
fairly
decent
roads
to
allow
of
their
getting
along
there
was
not
much
chance
of
the
authorities
ever
discovering
the
concealed
hobo
thieves
for
they
could
not
get
within
a
mile
of
the
shore
up
there
at
point
by
such
methods
the
only
way
it
could
be
reached
was
by
boat
or
possibly
through
the
means
of
an
aeroplane
such
as
the
bird
boys
were
now
using
few
places
but
could
be
spied
upon
when
one
had
the
means
for
passing
over
the
most
inaccessible
thickets
and
rocky
hills
after
a
time
they
had
gone
many
miles
occasionally
a
small
hamlet
was
seen
below
and
then
would
come
once
more
the
woods
that
extended
over
such
a
large
space
of
territory
in
this
part
of
the
country
this
was
generally
because
of
the
swampy
nature
of
the
ground
which
prevented
farming
operations
being
carried
on
while
the
difficulty
of
getting
the
logs
out
of
the
bogs
had
deterred
lumbering
thus
far
andy
had
done
his
part
of
the
work
faithfully
he
had
scoured
the
territory
over
which
they
passed
and
never
did
a
break
occur
however
small
but
he
clapped
his
eyes
upon
it
and
examined
the
open
space
thoroughly
there
rockford
ahead
and
we
passed
over
the
whole
stretch
of
swamp
and
forest
suppose
now
we
dropped
down
on
the
commons
and
get
bloomsbury
on
the
long
distance
phone
perhaps
they
might
have
some
news
they
could
give
us
and
as
andy
at
once
agreed
to
the
proposal
for
he
was
thirsty
anyhow
and
wanted
a
drink
of
soda
water
the
worst
kind
frank
began
to
descend
gracefully
they
had
about
half
the
population
of
the
place
gaping
at
them
as
they
finally
landed
on
the
big
green
frank
asked
his
cousin
to
stay
by
the
machine
while
he
sought
police
headquarters
and
asked
to
get
in
touch
with
the
home
town
he
had
no
sooner
made
the
connection
and
heard
some
one
answer
him
after
he
told
who
he
was
when
there
was
sent
along
the
wire
some
information
that
rather
gave
frank
a
shock
because
of
its
nature
and
the
fact
that
it
seemed
to
fully
dispose
of
the
theory
he
and
his
cousin
had
already
formed
chapter
x
heard
over
the
wire
luckily
the
center
of
interest
remained
around
the
odd
looking
aeroplane
with
the
metal
pontoons
underneath
its
body
so
that
frank
was
allowed
to
walk
away
almost
unnoticed
when
he
had
secured
the
important
information
he
inquired
for
and
which
was
leading
him
to
the
drug
store
nearest
the
town
green
true
an
aviator
had
landed
in
rockford
on
one
or
two
occasions
for
some
reason
or
other
in
times
past
since
the
bird
boys
could
not
remember
having
done
so
possibly
it
may
have
been
percy
carberry
anxious
to
enjoy
the
stares
of
the
good
people
and
pose
as
a
great
fellow
but
this
was
a
type
of
air
machine
with
which
none
of
them
were
familiar
and
as
so
much
space
was
being
taken
up
even
in
the
local
papers
with
the
accounts
of
the
wonderful
doings
of
daring
navigators
of
the
upper
currents
it
was
only
natural
that
some
bright
boy
should
speedily
guess
what
manner
of
craft
the
chance
visitor
to
rockford
must
be
hey
that
a
hyderplane
mister
ai
it
demanded
one
chap
after
he
had
glimpsed
the
construction
of
the
aluminum
pontoons
that
were
just
kept
from
contact
with
the
ground
by
the
bicycle
wheels
have
you
ever
seen
one
before
asked
andy
desirous
of
keeping
up
friendly
relations
with
the
crowd
for
he
knew
how
important
that
might
prove
since
as
yet
no
man
wearing
a
blue
uniform
had
put
in
an
appearance
and
should
any
hoodlum
choose
to
play
rough
house
or
try
to
be
too
familiar
with
the
apparatus
there
was
always
a
chance
that
some
damage
might
be
done
no
i
ai
but
i
seen
a
picture
of
that
coffyn
feller
down
on
the
hudson
river
nigh
new
york
and
she
looked
a
heap
like
this
here
shebang
came
the
quick
response
well
you
guessed
right
that
time
for
that
is
what
it
is
called
a
hydroplane
because
it
can
be
navigated
on
the
water
as
well
as
in
the
air
and
if
you
please
stand
back
so
as
not
to
bother
with
anything
because
the
least
handling
may
put
the
whole
machine
out
of
tune
be
glad
to
tell
you
something
about
how
we
manage
to
use
it
as
a
boat
andy
knew
how
to
manage
and
he
exerted
himself
to
entertain
the
crowd
while
frank
was
absent
keeping
their
interest
aroused
by
little
stories
of
things
that
had
happened
to
birdmen
in
recent
times
and
which
were
of
course
well
known
to
him
from
the
fact
that
both
the
cousins
kept
in
close
touch
with
all
that
went
on
in
the
world
of
aviation
all
the
while
andy
was
keeping
one
anxious
eye
out
for
the
sign
of
a
blue
uniform
and
brass
buttons
while
new
additions
kept
arriving
constantly
to
swell
the
eager
crowd
gathered
on
the
park
green
in
the
end
he
was
vastly
relieved
to
discover
a
policeman
hurrying
up
looking
as
serious
as
though
he
expected
to
discover
a
fight
or
two
youngsters
matching
pet
roosters
to
the
delight
of
the
gathered
host
for
since
the
flying
machine
lay
on
the
ground
it
was
mostly
concealed
from
his
view
and
he
would
never
have
known
what
it
was
anyway
of
course
when
he
arrived
on
the
scene
and
took
command
andy
quickly
gained
his
favor
by
a
little
subtle
flattery
and
after
that
felt
that
he
was
as
he
himself
expressed
it
on
easy
street
meanwhile
frank
had
proceeded
direct
to
the
drugstore
on
the
corner
about
two
blocks
away
from
the
end
of
the
green
where
they
had
told
him
he
could
talk
over
the
long
distance
phone
with
bloomsbury
he
was
pleased
to
find
that
they
had
a
regular
booth
in
the
store
for
he
knew
of
numerous
cases
where
the
phone
simply
stood
on
a
little
stand
and
everybody
could
hear
what
the
subject
of
the
talk
might
be
especially
one
side
of
it
once
closeted
in
the
booth
he
hastened
to
ask
for
connection
with
police
headquarters
at
bloomsbury
there
was
some
little
delay
as
though
these
long
distance
calls
might
be
of
rare
occurrence
in
the
local
central
but
finally
he
received
notice
that
connection
had
been
made
and
he
was
at
liberty
to
start
his
message
hello
this
bloomsbury
frank
asked
first
of
all
in
a
cautious
way
yes
came
the
reply
distinctly
enough
and
is
this
police
headquarters
yes
this
is
frank
bird
speaking
and
we
are
over
in
rockford
get
that
frank
continued
yes
again
came
the
reply
from
the
party
at
the
other
end
chief
waller
asked
us
before
we
left
bloomsbury
to
keep
in
touch
with
headquarters
and
that
you
would
supply
us
with
any
new
information
that
might
come
to
hand
while
we
scoured
the
country
overhead
looking
for
signs
of
the
men
who
robbed
the
bloomsbury
bank
last
night
and
escaped
in
percy
carberry
biplane
who
is
this
i
am
talking
to
please
officer
green
frank
oh
is
that
you
joe
i
did
recognize
your
voice
over
the
wire
frank
went
on
to
say
you
heard
what
the
chief
said
about
giving
us
the
latest
news
did
you
joe
i
certain
did
frank
answered
the
man
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
we
covered
quite
a
large
territory
up
to
now
and
think
we
run
across
a
clue
but
we
want
to
make
sure
before
putting
the
bloodhounds
of
the
law
on
the
scent
get
that
frank
was
wise
to
the
fact
that
officer
green
took
himself
and
his
position
on
the
local
police
force
very
seriously
true
he
had
never
done
anything
very
great
to
distinguish
himself
beyond
once
stopping
a
runaway
horse
that
some
people
said
was
too
decrepit
to
have
gone
twenty
paces
further
and
rescuing
a
little
pet
dog
that
had
fallen
into
the
lake
from
a
wharf
but
then
he
believed
in
himself
and
read
up
all
the
thrilling
stories
of
police
achievements
that
were
published
in
the
new
york
papers
satisfied
that
sooner
or
later
the
day
was
bound
to
come
when
he
would
be
able
to
prove
himself
a
grand
hero
and
that
was
just
why
artful
frank
used
that
phrase
bloodhounds
of
the
law
for
he
knew
that
it
would
cause
joe
green
to
puff
up
with
pride
and
feel
more
kindly
disposed
than
ever
toward
the
speaker
he
gauged
matters
exactly
right
too
it
seemed
for
when
the
police
officer
spoke
again
it
was
with
additional
eagerness
good
for
you
frank
all
bloomsbury
expects
the
bird
boys
to
do
the
old
town
proud
again
many
the
time
have
you
done
it
in
the
past
we
all
know
and
when
you
feel
dead
sure
that
you
got
track
of
the
desprit
villains
who
looted
our
town
bank
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
give
the
police
the
signal
and
they
throw
a
around
the
of
the
yeggs
that
what
we
here
for
that
what
we
draw
our
salaries
for
to
protect
the
citizens
of
bloomsbury
against
danger
by
fire
flood
robbers
and
the
like
frank
knew
only
too
well
how
officer
green
liked
to
talk
especially
when
once
started
on
the
subject
of
his
exalted
office
and
accordingly
he
thought
it
time
to
cut
him
short
before
he
could
get
launched
on
the
sea
of
police
duties
tell
me
have
you
learned
anything
new
since
we
left
he
asked
why
yes
we
just
had
a
man
in
here
who
had
heard
about
the
robbery
and
that
it
was
suspected
the
thieves
had
escaped
by
means
of
the
biplane
belonging
to
the
carberry
boy
he
thought
as
how
we
might
be
glad
to
know
that
he
sighted
a
flying
machine
just
after
daybreak
why
yes
that
ought
to
be
an
important
piece
of
news
remarked
frank
wondering
whether
it
would
corroborate
that
which
the
farm
hand
felix
boggs
had
already
contributed
to
the
fund
of
knowledge
concerning
the
movements
of
the
fleeing
yeggmen
i
thought
it
was
and
i
only
waiting
right
now
to
forward
it
to
the
chief
as
soon
as
he
calls
me
on
the
wire
from
hazenhurst
or
some
other
place
where
he
apt
to
turn
up
came
over
the
wire
from
the
home
town
do
cut
me
off
yet
central
called
out
frank
hastily
as
he
thought
he
detected
an
uneasy
movement
which
was
doubtless
a
sigh
given
by
the
girl
who
possibly
had
her
ear
to
the
wire
drinking
in
what
was
being
said
i
not
near
done
talking
yet
hello
joe
yes
i
here
frank
what
more
do
you
want
to
ask
me
came
from
miles
away
and
in
imagination
he
could
see
officer
green
crouched
at
the
telephone
stand
as
he
remembered
it
at
police
headquarters
in
bloomsbury
feeling
the
importance
of
his
relations
with
the
public
as
a
genuine
guardian
of
the
peace
why
it
of
considerable
importance
to
us
to
know
in
which
direction
the
aeroplane
was
going
at
the
time
this
party
sighted
it
frank
went
on
to
say
and
i
hope
he
told
you
that
which
he
did
without
my
asking
replied
officer
green
quickly
though
you
may
be
sure
i
would
have
done
the
same
before
letting
him
leave
because
i
was
on
to
the
fact
that
it
would
be
a
pretty
good
pointer
oh
he
thought
of
it
himself
did
he
the
young
aviator
shot
back
well
that
was
pretty
bright
of
him
and
shows
that
he
was
a
fellow
to
take
notice
and
now
please
tell
me
what
he
said
about
the
direction
in
which
the
biplane
was
headed
at
the
last
instant
he
could
see
it
far
away
in
the
distance
exactly
southwest
frank
this
gave
frank
a
sudden
jar
because
it
upset
the
theories
he
and
andy
had
been
forming
concerning
the
escaping
bank
robbers
they
had
believed
the
two
men
had
gone
almost
directly
north
southwest
you
say
joe
he
asked
wishing
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
he
said
exactly
southwest
and
as
he
kept
repeating
that
word
a
number
of
times
there
is
a
bit
of
chance
that
i
get
it
mixed
you
can
depend
on
it
frank
and
if
you
away
up
at
rockford
seems
to
me
you
have
to
make
a
big
change
of
base
right
soon
if
you
want
to
get
in
touch
with
them
raskils
frank
mind
was
in
somewhat
of
a
whirl
he
wondered
whether
the
farm
hand
felix
boggs
could
have
been
mistaken
in
what
he
had
said
though
andy
too
had
seen
the
biplane
and
noted
the
direction
of
its
flight
but
perhaps
this
farmer
or
whoever
he
might
turn
out
to
be
had
discovered
the
fugitive
flying
machine
at
a
much
later
time
after
the
two
men
had
changed
the
course
of
their
flight
i
suppose
you
might
as
well
tell
me
who
the
party
was
from
whom
you
got
your
news
joe
he
remarked
though
without
any
particular
object
in
view
since
he
could
hardly
expect
to
hunt
the
other
up
and
ask
more
questions
and
then
came
the
answer
that
gave
frank
quite
a
thrill
as
he
grasped
the
peculiar
significance
of
it
all
why
you
know
him
all
right
frank
said
officer
green
glibly
the
pilot
of
the
little
lake
steamer
and
his
name
todd
pemberton
chapter
xi
comparing
notes
he
must
have
hurried
up
to
headquarters
then
as
soon
as
he
landed
because
we
saw
the
mermaid
crossing
the
northern
end
of
the
lake
bound
for
the
lumber
camp
before
heading
for
bloomsbury
how
about
it
joe
frank
went
on
to
ask
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
from
his
surprise
after
hearing
that
particular
name
mentioned
said
he
heard
about
the
robbery
came
over
the
wire
in
officer
ponderous
tones
and
the
fact
of
the
raskils
skipping
out
with
the
carberry
boy
biplane
as
soon
as
he
put
foot
ashore
and
thinking
that
the
police
might
like
to
know
what
he
had
seen
he
just
ran
all
the
way
here
which
i
take
it
was
mighty
thoughtful
of
todd
declared
frank
drily
but
if
he
spoke
sarcastically
the
fact
was
not
known
to
the
man
at
the
other
end
i
told
him
so
and
complimented
him
on
his
zeal
in
assisting
the
course
of
justice
the
other
continued
which
was
all
the
more
remarkable
you
know
frank
because
to
tell
the
truth
todd
himself
was
once
a
bad
egg
until
he
reformed
and
got
his
present
job
it
does
him
great
credit
sure
it
does
he
went
away
after
letting
you
know
that
if
you
hoped
to
capture
the
thieves
you
have
to
chase
southwest
and
not
north
did
he
joe
oh
yes
about
ten
minutes
ago
i
reckon
but
i
assured
him
that
if
we
did
succeed
in
capturing
the
rogues
he
would
not
be
forgotten
in
the
division
of
the
reward
that
was
sure
to
be
offered
by
the
bank
for
the
recovery
of
the
money
and
securities
that
were
taken
not
to
speak
of
the
five
hundred
young
carberry
has
said
he
would
pay
for
the
recovery
of
his
biplane
and
the
arrest
of
the
thieves
that
was
nice
of
you
joe
but
only
what
might
be
expected
because
your
heart
is
as
big
as
a
bushel
basket
frank
went
on
to
say
and
when
you
told
todd
that
how
did
he
take
it
why
he
just
chuckled
and
looked
at
me
kind
of
funny
and
said
he
never
hoped
to
take
any
of
the
reward
money
that
the
police
were
justly
entitled
to
because
of
their
activities
replied
the
other
it
plain
to
be
seen
that
todd
is
a
generous
fellow
but
i
obliged
to
you
joe
for
giving
me
this
information
because
you
see
we
now
got
some
foundation
to
build
on
goodbye
joe
with
that
frank
rang
off
he
knew
that
he
might
chat
with
the
gossipy
police
officer
in
bloomsbury
for
at
least
fifteen
minutes
but
what
was
the
use
when
he
already
knew
all
the
other
had
to
tell
and
the
news
that
had
come
over
the
wire
was
of
considerable
importance
too
he
smiled
as
he
hurried
out
of
the
drugstore
not
even
waiting
to
quench
his
thirst
at
the
soda
fountain
though
a
short
time
before
he
as
well
as
andy
had
complained
of
feeling
so
exceedingly
dry
but
then
all
that
was
now
forgotten
in
this
excitement
connected
with
the
latest
development
in
the
robbery
case
it
was
back
to
the
village
green
now
with
frank
the
crowd
was
greater
than
ever
and
he
quickly
saw
there
would
be
no
opportunity
for
any
communication
between
himself
and
his
cousin
until
they
had
left
for
the
upper
realms
where
surrounded
only
by
silence
they
could
converse
while
the
busy
motor
hummed
and
the
aeroplane
headed
as
they
willed
either
high
above
the
hills
or
skirting
the
tops
of
the
forest
trees
accordingly
frank
addressed
himself
to
the
arduous
task
of
getting
away
without
any
mishap
he
as
well
as
andy
had
long
since
learned
that
it
is
the
part
of
wisdom
to
gain
the
good
will
of
a
curious
crowd
in
that
manner
many
friends
are
raised
up
who
are
only
too
willing
to
lend
a
helping
hand
he
quickly
selected
half
a
dozen
fellows
who
looked
as
though
they
might
be
of
more
than
ordinary
importance
among
the
boys
of
these
he
particularly
picked
out
and
asked
them
to
assist
the
police
officer
to
keep
the
crowd
back
until
they
could
get
a
good
start
at
the
same
time
explaining
that
a
clear
passage
would
have
to
be
made
ahead
and
that
anyone
getting
in
the
way
might
not
only
be
seriously
injured
but
wreck
the
machine
as
well
proud
to
have
been
thus
honored
the
six
boys
proceeded
to
push
back
the
gaping
crowd
and
when
frank
gave
the
word
also
assisted
in
starting
the
hydroplane
on
its
way
a
salvo
of
loud
cheers
rang
out
when
they
started
and
this
burst
into
a
furious
chorus
as
the
well
balanced
aeroplane
presently
left
the
ground
to
start
upward
into
the
air
i
glad
that
over
with
said
andy
when
they
were
safely
off
the
ground
and
the
shouts
of
rockford
enthusiastic
population
began
to
grow
fainter
in
the
distance
same
here
echoed
frank
you
never
know
what
will
happen
when
a
crowd
is
pushing
all
around
you
every
fellow
eager
to
just
say
he
had
hold
of
a
flying
machine
there
always
one
or
two
of
the
lot
ready
to
hang
on
and
risk
their
lives
just
to
see
how
it
feels
to
be
carried
up
on
an
aeroplane
they
the
kind
i
most
afraid
of
well
did
you
get
police
headquarters
in
bloomsbury
frank
no
trouble
about
that
and
our
old
friend
officer
green
was
in
charge
during
the
absence
of
the
chief
the
other
bird
boy
answered
anything
new
developed
since
we
left
asked
andy
just
one
thing
and
joe
thought
it
meant
a
whole
lot
frank
went
on
to
say
which
was
what
inquired
the
other
a
man
came
hurrying
in
and
told
how
he
had
seen
a
flying
machine
containing
two
parties
just
after
daybreak
and
making
directly
toward
the
southwest
andy
what
do
you
think
of
that
now
for
news
his
cousin
gave
a
whistle
whew
important
if
true
he
vouchsafed
tersely
that
sounds
as
if
you
had
some
trouble
believing
it
chuckled
frank
well
considering
what
i
saw
myself
i
have
to
know
the
name
of
this
party
first
before
i
believe
anything
he
said
andy
went
on
oh
you
know
him
alright
fact
is
we
were
speaking
of
the
same
not
a
great
while
back
frank
observed
quietly
do
make
me
start
in
guessing
frank
because
we
been
talking
of
a
dozen
people
but
tell
me
right
out
who
it
is
andy
pleaded
the
pilot
of
the
mermaid
andy
gee
do
you
mean
todd
pemberton
exclaimed
the
other
just
him
and
no
one
else
why
he
was
that
anxious
to
let
the
police
know
he
had
seen
an
aeroplane
steering
away
straight
into
the
southwest
early
this
morning
that
as
soon
as
he
warped
his
boat
to
the
wharf
todd
like
a
citizen
hiked
away
for
headquarters
as
fast
as
he
could
run
hardly
waiting
long
enough
to
understand
about
the
bank
being
robbed
and
percy
biplane
being
used
by
the
thieves
as
a
means
of
making
a
quick
andy
turned
his
head
and
looked
in
his
cousin
face
citizen
go
hang
he
said
contemptuously
after
what
we
saw
frank
it
easy
for
us
to
understand
just
what
it
was
made
todd
want
the
police
to
do
all
their
hunting
away
off
in
the
southwest
yes
what
do
you
think
was
his
object
asked
frank
as
he
held
the
aeroplane
just
about
five
hundred
feet
above
the
level
ground
covered
by
forests
as
in
most
places
around
to
the
north
of
bloomsbury
though
occasionally
they
ran
across
farms
that
looked
like
oases
in
the
dessert
why
that
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
my
face
replied
andy
and
nobody
ever
had
any
trouble
about
seeing
that
i
guess
todd
wanted
to
get
in
a
little
bit
of
assistance
for
his
friends
the
hoboes
who
looted
the
bank
and
he
could
do
them
the
best
thing
ever
by
turning
suspicion
in
nearly
the
opposite
quarter
if
chief
waller
could
be
assured
that
the
last
seen
of
the
biplane
before
it
vanished
in
the
distance
it
was
heading
into
the
southwest
of
course
he
take
all
his
men
off
in
that
direction
and
the
bank
robbers
hiding
perhaps
around
the
northern
end
of
lake
sunrise
would
be
free
to
do
whatever
they
wanted
do
i
hit
about
the
same
guess
that
you
do
frank
you
just
echoed
what
i
had
in
mind
returned
his
cousin
only
i
had
more
time
to
think
it
over
and
perhaps
gone
a
little
further
than
you
could
as
how
demanded
the
other
promptly
just
as
frank
knew
he
would
why
you
know
it
struck
us
as
queer
that
these
fellows
should
want
to
hang
out
within
twenty
miles
of
the
town
where
they
just
made
a
successful
raid
on
the
bank
it
would
stand
to
reason
that
they
be
only
too
glad
to
cut
for
it
after
getting
possession
of
percy
fine
new
aeroplane
and
by
keeping
on
north
reach
lake
ontario
and
perhaps
fly
across
to
canada
where
they
be
safe
yes
sure
we
talked
that
over
before
frank
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
either
they
met
with
some
sort
of
accident
to
the
biplane
and
had
to
hold
over
till
the
fellow
who
used
to
be
an
aviator
repaired
the
same
or
else
that
they
had
some
other
robbery
in
mind
and
wanted
to
make
a
double
killing
of
it
before
skipping
out
all
right
you
can
see
then
that
if
chief
waller
and
about
all
his
men
got
on
a
warm
clue
that
led
them
off
to
the
southwest
for
a
day
or
so
it
would
leave
things
open
for
the
carrying
out
of
this
second
scheme
when
andy
heard
his
cousin
say
this
so
gravely
he
seemed
more
startled
than
ever
say
i
believe
you
gone
and
struck
the
truth
just
as
you
nearly
always
do
old
fellow
not
by
luck
but
by
figuring
it
out
to
get
the
coast
clear
then
this
sly
todd
pemberton
means
to
go
on
bringing
in
important
news
and
keeping
poor
old
chief
waller
worked
up
to
speed
chasing
around
down
there
after
shadows
yes
that
must
be
the
game
they
got
in
hand
and
perhaps
that
what
all
those
waves
of
handkerchiefs
meant
between
the
pilot
of
the
little
mermaid
and
the
fellow
we
could
see
who
was
hidden
in
the
bushes
on
norton
point
he
was
undoubtedly
there
just
to
give
todd
the
high
sign
when
the
boat
passed
both
of
us
spoke
of
the
fact
that
we
never
known
the
steamboat
to
keep
so
far
north
when
making
the
run
from
cranford
across
the
lake
up
to
the
lumber
camp
on
our
northwest
side
but
now
we
can
understand
why
he
wanted
to
make
sure
his
partners
in
crime
were
ready
for
him
to
do
his
little
share
in
the
game
which
is
to
send
the
police
on
a
wild
goose
chase
and
leave
bloomsbury
next
to
unprotected
tonight
but
whatever
in
the
wide
world
frank
do
you
think
they
mean
to
try
next
i
could
guess
in
a
year
was
the
reply
of
the
boy
who
manipulated
the
levers
of
the
hydroplane
so
dextrously
it
might
be
any
one
of
a
dozen
or
two
games
the
bank
is
the
only
institution
in
bloomsbury
carrying
a
lot
of
money
in
the
safe
and
then
there
are
several
rich
men
we
happen
to
know
who
keep
a
little
fortune
about
the
house
in
the
way
of
money
jewelry
or
curios
for
all
we
know
these
yeggs
may
even
have
an
eye
on
your
house
or
mine
because
they
could
make
a
pretty
good
haul
there
whew
was
all
andy
said
just
then
but
his
mind
was
undoubtedly
filled
with
startling
ideas
chapter
xii
at
the
hoskins
farm
well
andy
went
on
to
remark
presently
i
see
you
are
turning
back
again
in
the
direction
of
the
head
of
the
lake
i
hope
frank
you
mean
to
go
all
the
way
to
bloomsbury
and
put
the
police
in
possession
of
the
few
facts
we
succeeded
in
picking
up
that
was
not
my
calculation
at
all
replied
the
other
in
the
first
place
we
suspect
a
good
deal
but
up
to
now
we
have
got
very
much
positive
evidence
on
which
to
found
a
case
i
like
to
know
a
little
more
before
i
get
the
chief
on
the
wire
and
put
him
wise
then
when
we
get
near
the
northern
end
of
the
lake
perhaps
you
think
it
best
to
make
a
landing
somewhere
and
prowl
around
on
foot
finding
out
what
we
can
andy
continued
eagerly
for
he
had
become
much
worked
up
by
this
time
and
was
hoping
that
fortune
would
be
as
kind
to
them
as
on
a
previous
occasion
which
all
bloomsbury
remembered
very
well
if
we
can
only
find
a
decent
opening
where
we
could
make
a
again
that
is
the
only
thing
that
bothers
me
frank
replied
now
i
remember
noticing
a
field
near
what
seemed
to
be
a
lonely
farmhouse
in
fact
there
were
a
number
of
open
places
there
and
they
seemed
to
have
canada
thistles
growing
in
clumps
all
as
if
the
farmer
had
given
up
cultivating
and
let
things
just
go
to
rack
and
ruin
i
was
never
up
there
myself
but
from
what
i
heard
my
father
say
i
rather
think
that
must
be
the
hoskins
place
they
say
he
consulted
some
fortune
teller
a
couple
of
years
ago
who
told
him
he
would
some
day
discover
a
gold
mine
on
his
property
that
would
make
him
a
millionaire
and
ever
since
the
farmer
has
spent
about
all
his
time
digging
here
and
there
but
up
to
now
without
any
success
at
all
why
yes
i
remember
hearing
a
lot
about
the
queer
old
farmer
myself
frank
went
on
to
say
he
got
a
wife
and
a
daughter
named
sallie
i
met
her
at
a
country
dance
last
winter
and
she
a
pretty
nice
sort
of
a
girl
now
we
been
on
the
move
a
good
while
andy
and
perhaps
we
might
manage
to
make
the
hoskins
farm
around
the
dinner
hour
a
bully
good
idea
too
frank
and
do
you
forget
it
cried
the
other
with
considerable
show
of
enthusiasm
now
i
just
bolted
what
little
breakfast
i
got
this
morning
and
already
i
feel
hungry
enough
to
eat
nearly
anything
and
speaking
generally
these
country
people
do
set
a
great
table
though
i
do
know
how
it
will
be
with
the
hoskins
because
if
they
been
neglecting
their
farm
to
chase
around
after
rainbows
they
probably
wo
be
any
too
flush
with
supplies
but
any
port
in
a
storm
and
i
guess
we
be
able
to
get
filled
up
if
only
we
can
make
a
landing
and
find
the
farm
as
i
figure
it
out
hoskins
place
would
be
over
a
mile
or
so
directly
above
norton
point
andy
the
pilot
of
the
expedition
continued
thoughtfully
yes
andy
said
encouragingly
and
perhaps
now
we
might
happen
to
run
on
some
sort
of
a
little
clue
there
for
instance
one
of
those
yeggmen
may
have
wandered
around
and
bought
some
eggs
or
milk
from
the
farmer
folks
because
if
been
camping
out
in
the
woods
they
had
to
eat
all
the
while
you
know
a
good
idea
frank
and
we
ask
if
we
lucky
enough
to
happen
around
the
lonely
farm
about
meal
time
i
going
to
make
it
a
point
to
be
there
and
as
we
got
some
time
to
kill
meanwhile
let
hop
over
to
that
nice
landingplace
at
the
foot
of
old
thunder
top
and
overhaul
the
machine
again
there
are
a
few
things
i
like
to
tinker
with
because
i
not
quite
pleased
with
the
way
they
work
and
you
know
andy
i
a
regular
crank
about
having
a
motor
run
like
a
watch
well
i
getting
that
way
mighty
fast
thanks
to
your
hints
and
the
knowledge
of
how
it
pays
when
you
taking
your
life
in
your
hands
every
time
you
go
up
in
one
of
these
outfits
was
what
the
other
bird
boy
observed
with
what
was
a
thoughtful
look
for
him
because
as
a
rule
andy
appeared
to
be
a
merry
chap
and
laughing
much
of
the
time
within
half
an
hour
they
had
successfully
landed
at
the
place
indicated
and
which
had
witnessed
the
coming
and
going
of
the
young
aeronauts
on
numerous
occasions
here
at
least
they
could
remain
and
take
things
easy
while
waiting
for
the
morning
to
slip
along
so
that
eleven
would
roll
around
little
danger
of
their
being
bothered
by
curious
persons
here
indeed
the
boys
had
never
yet
known
a
solitary
man
or
boy
to
come
around
the
place
they
could
look
up
while
lying
there
on
their
backs
and
watch
the
fleecy
clouds
sailing
swiftly
past
the
lofty
crown
of
the
rocky
mountain
and
how
vividly
there
came
into
their
minds
memories
of
lively
times
which
they
themselves
had
experienced
up
there
on
the
summit
of
old
thunder
top
they
spoke
of
them
now
as
they
lay
stretched
out
on
the
soft
turf
and
watched
the
two
white
headed
eagles
soaring
far
up
in
the
blue
heavens
around
and
around
in
circles
without
ever
seeming
to
flap
their
great
wings
once
the
young
aviators
had
engaged
in
a
terrible
conflict
with
those
two
mighty
birds
on
the
crown
of
the
mountain
where
they
had
landed
with
their
aeroplane
and
been
looked
upon
as
intruders
by
the
eagles
possibly
under
the
belief
that
they
entertained
hostile
intentions
toward
the
fledglings
in
their
nest
that
was
built
amidst
the
crags
close
to
the
tip
of
the
lofty
peak
frank
and
andy
often
spoke
of
that
thrilling
episode
but
never
without
some
sort
of
little
shiver
because
it
had
been
a
serious
time
with
them
since
one
blow
from
those
powerful
wings
might
have
toppled
them
over
the
edge
of
the
dizzy
height
and
sent
them
to
their
deaths
but
they
had
succeeded
in
beating
their
feather
antagonists
off
by
the
aid
of
clubs
which
they
wielded
with
vigor
and
after
the
eagles
learned
that
no
harm
was
intended
to
their
young
by
these
bold
navigators
of
the
upper
air
currents
they
came
to
have
more
respect
for
the
strange
winged
thing
that
came
humming
up
from
the
earth
on
more
than
one
occasion
when
eleven
came
around
the
boys
were
off
again
and
headed
toward
the
northern
end
of
the
lake
of
course
they
kept
close
down
to
the
treetops
because
once
they
discovered
the
opening
they
would
wish
to
drop
into
it
as
easily
as
possible
suddenly
andy
who
was
on
the
lookout
while
frank
paid
more
attention
to
the
easy
working
of
the
motor
and
the
steering
of
the
hydroplane
uttered
an
exclamation
of
satisfaction
i
see
it
dead
ahead
he
remarked
in
a
satisfied
tone
we
made
a
bee
line
to
the
place
from
the
foot
of
the
mountain
frank
and
unless
away
off
in
my
guess
the
farmhouse
lies
over
yonder
beyond
the
trees
so
nobody
apt
to
see
us
come
down
and
we
can
make
any
sort
of
yarn
we
want
to
explain
just
why
we
here
right
now
we
can
do
that
all
right
without
telling
anything
that
is
so
replied
the
other
aviator
the
farmer
does
know
us
though
sallie
will
and
on
that
account
we
must
be
careful
what
we
say
but
the
dinner
the
main
thing
just
now
and
at
the
same
time
we
try
and
pick
up
a
little
information
if
farmer
hoskins
happens
to
know
anything
that
would
interest
two
fellows
of
our
stamp
he
passed
over
the
opening
once
to
make
sure
that
it
contained
all
the
necessary
requisites
for
a
successful
landing
and
also
a
launching
of
the
airship
then
making
a
graceful
sweep
back
again
frank
allowed
the
aeroplane
to
drop
lightly
to
the
ground
it
landed
in
almost
the
center
of
the
field
and
both
boys
saw
that
they
might
get
away
again
without
a
great
amount
of
trouble
fine
was
the
comment
of
the
pilot
as
he
jumped
to
the
ground
and
bent
over
to
detach
some
part
of
the
machinery
without
which
the
motor
as
andy
always
said
would
not
move
worth
a
cent
this
he
often
took
with
him
just
as
a
chauffeur
might
the
spark
plug
of
an
automobile
rendering
it
helpless
unless
the
thief
were
prepared
to
supply
the
deficiency
which
was
a
remote
possibility
that
never
worried
frank
now
for
grub
announced
the
hungry
andy
leading
off
in
the
direction
where
he
had
reason
to
believe
the
farmhouse
lay
frank
always
declared
that
andy
had
a
most
wonderful
nose
for
a
meal
that
was
preparing
and
could
spot
a
camp
a
mile
away
just
by
the
smell
of
frying
onions
or
coffee
cooking
at
any
rate
he
proved
to
be
a
successful
pilot
on
the
present
occasion
for
in
a
short
time
they
were
passing
through
an
abandoned
grain
field
where
the
bees
and
butterflies
were
swarming
about
the
many
lavender
colored
flowers
of
the
great
clumps
of
thistles
and
the
smoke
from
the
farmhouse
kitchen
arose
just
over
a
little
knoll
told
you
so
said
andy
as
they
drew
near
the
house
and
caught
fragrant
odors
of
cooking
in
the
air
upon
their
knocking
a
girl
came
to
the
open
door
and
recognized
frank
immediately
as
a
boy
she
had
met
at
the
country
dance
the
preceding
winter
but
nothing
she
said
would
indicate
that
the
hoskins
living
here
away
from
the
world
as
they
did
with
the
head
of
the
house
spending
all
his
time
hunting
for
that
he
still
believed
in
had
heard
anything
to
speak
of
about
the
wonderful
things
the
bird
boys
had
been
doing
lately
frank
was
glad
of
this
and
he
just
casually
mentioned
that
they
chanced
to
find
themselves
near
the
farm
and
wondered
if
they
could
get
dinner
there
so
the
good
housewife
was
brought
out
and
with
true
country
hospitality
she
immediately
invited
both
boys
to
sit
down
with
them
although
saying
that
they
were
not
as
well
supplied
with
the
good
things
that
used
to
be
seen
on
their
table
before
father
took
to
boring
those
horrid
holes
all
over
the
place
thinking
to
strike
a
coal
vein
or
perhaps
a
silver
mine
he
was
off
now
and
would
not
show
up
until
night
for
the
farm
was
one
of
vast
dimensions
and
covered
miles
of
territory
but
we
have
a
boarder
said
sallie
as
they
sat
down
at
the
table
sometimes
he
here
to
meals
and
again
he
gets
so
far
away
chasing
his
butterflies
that
he
just
carries
what
he
calls
a
snack
in
his
pocket
such
a
queer
little
man
he
is
too
with
his
brown
glasses
on
and
always
running
this
way
and
that
with
his
little
net
in
which
he
captures
the
butterflies
that
come
to
the
thistles
on
our
old
barren
fields
perhaps
he
turn
up
while
you
here
i
like
you
to
meet
professor
whitesides
who
is
from
a
big
college
he
tells
us
and
spending
his
vacation
in
the
way
he
likes
sometimes
i
think
he
a
little
off
up
here
and
she
touched
her
head
as
she
said
this
and
that
perhaps
he
got
hurt
worse
than
he
thinks
the
time
he
met
with
the
accident
that
crippled
his
arm
somehow
andy
looked
up
when
he
heard
about
that
broken
arm
to
find
his
cousin
giving
him
the
wink
while
his
eyebrows
were
elevated
in
a
suggestive
way
just
as
much
as
to
say
now
here
something
mighty
interesting
already
that
would
pay
us
to
look
into
because
we
know
of
another
fellow
who
is
troubled
with
a
crippled
arm
and
his
name
happens
to
be
casper
blue
chapter
xiii
the
butterfly
collector
the
dinner
passed
off
without
the
odd
little
professor
showing
up
although
sallie
said
it
was
nothing
unusual
for
him
and
that
he
was
liable
to
appear
at
any
time
carrying
his
little
white
and
a
small
handbag
in
which
he
claimed
to
keep
the
trophies
of
the
chase
that
had
been
run
down
during
his
last
campaign
frank
wanted
to
get
a
chance
to
confer
with
his
chum
and
as
soon
as
he
could
conveniently
withdraw
from
the
table
giving
andy
a
nod
he
went
out
on
the
porch
where
he
could
look
down
the
lane
that
led
to
the
poor
road
which
in
turn
after
many
trials
and
tribulations
merged
into
the
main
pike
andy
joined
him
there
a
minute
later
with
a
question
in
his
eye
professor
whitesides
was
what
frank
remarked
and
a
butterfly
collector
at
that
andy
went
on
to
say
with
cutting
sarcasm
that
sounds
pretty
rich
to
me
his
cousin
continued
i
wonder
now
could
it
be
possible
that
the
other
man
we
heard
of
lately
casper
blue
is
playing
a
smart
trick
on
these
honest
people
who
would
never
dream
that
he
could
be
anything
else
than
he
claimed
it
would
give
him
a
splendid
chance
to
wander
around
just
whenever
and
wherever
he
wanted
to
go
and
nobody
to
ask
questions
then
when
he
got
hungry
why
he
could
drop
in
at
the
farm
perhaps
he
do
like
camping
out
as
well
as
the
other
fellow
perhaps
his
health
is
too
delicate
to
stand
roughing
it
or
he
might
have
any
one
of
a
dozen
other
reasons
for
carrying
on
this
way
always
providing
that
this
is
casper
blue
andy
was
brimful
of
excitement
his
manner
would
forcibly
remind
one
of
the
nervous
tension
that
seizes
upon
the
hounds
when
the
scent
grows
strong
and
they
anticipate
coming
in
sight
of
their
quarry
at
any
moment
we
taking
a
good
deal
for
granted
seems
to
me
remarked
frank
of
course
but
then
see
how
queer
it
is
that
this
man
who
calls
himself
a
college
professor
and
collector
of
bugs
and
butterflies
should
just
happen
to
drop
in
here
at
the
hoskins
farm
where
the
thistles
grow
so
wild
and
the
moths
and
other
things
are
to
be
found
by
thousands
we
never
heard
of
him
in
town
that
i
can
remember
and
then
he
small
in
size
together
with
a
stiff
arm
that
was
injured
in
an
accident
well
was
casper
blue
knocked
out
of
his
job
as
an
air
pilot
by
his
arm
failing
him
when
he
had
to
handle
the
levers
like
a
flash
or
have
his
aeroplane
turn
frank
i
tell
you
i
just
feel
dead
sure
our
man
and
that
we
found
the
clue
we
want
the
first
thing
well
if
we
could
manage
to
get
a
peep
into
his
room
perhaps
we
would
run
across
something
worth
while
frank
suggested
we
might
pretend
to
be
deeply
interested
in
butterflies
ourselves
remarked
andy
even
if
we
do
really
know
one
kind
from
another
and
perhaps
if
you
gave
sallie
a
sly
hint
that
you
be
tickled
to
see
what
sort
of
a
collection
her
professor
has
with
him
she
let
us
look
in
his
room
we
make
the
try
anyhow
said
frank
firmly
but
think
of
this
casper
blue
being
able
to
carry
out
the
part
of
a
learned
professor
would
you
that
is
something
most
yeggmen
would
find
a
pretty
hard
proposition
do
you
say
frank
well
stop
and
think
a
little
andy
was
the
other
reply
to
this
from
all
accounts
this
man
is
just
a
common
everyday
hobo
he
used
to
be
known
as
something
of
an
aviator
before
he
met
with
that
accident
that
disabled
his
arm
and
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
go
up
again
and
the
fact
is
i
seem
to
remember
having
seen
that
name
mentioned
among
a
list
of
airmen
who
had
been
either
killed
or
knocked
out
by
accidents
happening
to
them
that
all
right
frank
but
it
takes
a
pretty
smart
man
to
carry
out
a
part
like
he
doing
did
larry
tell
us
that
this
same
casper
blue
had
once
been
an
actor
before
he
took
to
the
air
for
a
living
asked
frank
you
right
he
did
that
same
thing
but
somehow
it
seemed
to
have
slipped
my
mind
but
you
never
forget
a
single
thing
do
you
frank
and
if
he
used
to
be
an
actor
why
of
course
casper
would
find
it
easy
to
play
this
part
perhaps
he
just
enjoying
it
the
best
you
ever
heard
of
some
people
are
never
happy
unless
they
hoodwinking
others
let
go
back
and
find
sallie
and
get
to
talking
about
butterflies
and
gypsy
moths
and
all
sorts
of
things
in
that
line
we
can
think
of
suggested
frank
then
she
believe
we
head
over
ears
interested
in
what
her
boarder
is
doing
and
if
i
give
her
a
little
hint
she
may
ask
us
to
step
in
and
take
a
peek
at
his
room
of
course
we
might
pick
up
anything
worth
while
there
and
then
again
there
always
a
little
chance
we
could
it
worth
while
i
think
declared
andy
who
seldom
disagreed
with
any
proposition
his
cousin
advanced
simply
because
frank
was
usually
so
wise
that
he
succeeded
in
covering
the
whole
ground
the
very
first
thing
so
they
once
more
left
the
porch
though
both
boys
looked
down
the
lane
before
going
in
to
make
sure
that
the
queer
little
butterfly
collector
was
not
coming
in
time
to
interfere
with
their
immediate
plans
sallie
was
just
tidying
up
the
diningroom
when
they
found
her
the
good
woman
of
the
house
seemed
to
have
gone
into
the
kitchen
where
she
was
preserving
some
sort
of
fruit
or
making
catsup
to
judge
from
the
fragrant
odors
that
came
floating
out
from
that
part
of
the
farmhouse
naturally
sallie
was
only
too
willing
to
enter
into
conversation
again
with
two
such
attractive
looking
and
bright
boys
as
frank
and
andy
bird
she
must
have
been
aware
of
the
fact
that
they
were
favorites
among
the
girls
of
bloomsbury
and
of
course
also
knew
something
about
their
being
aviators
although
both
or
had
shunned
that
subject
carefully
while
at
the
dinner
table
and
so
frank
managed
to
gradually
steer
the
conversation
around
to
the
subject
of
bug
collection
he
told
of
a
friend
he
once
had
who
was
daffy
along
that
line
and
would
rather
capture
some
queer
looking
old
hairy
moth
with
a
sign
on
his
front
than
enjoy
the
finest
supper
or
listen
to
the
best
play
that
allowed
andy
to
venture
the
suggestion
that
he
had
taken
considerable
interest
in
butterflies
himself
and
always
wanted
to
see
a
collection
that
was
worth
while
of
course
he
did
not
have
to
explain
that
the
only
interest
he
ever
did
have
in
the
matter
was
when
as
a
very
small
boy
he
used
to
chase
after
the
fluttering
insects
as
they
went
from
flower
to
flower
until
shown
by
his
mother
how
cruel
it
was
to
destroy
the
life
of
such
wonderfully
beautiful
things
that
he
could
not
restore
again
sallie
took
the
bait
andy
knew
from
the
eager
light
that
flashed
upon
her
face
and
when
he
saw
her
step
over
to
a
window
and
look
quickly
down
the
lane
he
turned
to
his
cousin
and
made
a
grimace
as
much
as
to
say
see
how
she
fell
to
my
little
game
will
you
old
fellow
well
said
sallie
flitting
back
again
professor
whitesides
got
a
very
large
collection
and
the
new
specimens
he
gathers
day
after
day
he
kept
in
some
place
because
he
has
no
time
just
now
to
do
anything
with
them
he
says
but
come
up
with
me
and
i
show
you
the
little
case
he
brought
with
him
sure
we
will
and
i
glad
of
the
chance
to
see
what
valuable
butterflies
look
like
andy
went
on
to
remark
he
says
this
little
collection
is
a
very
rare
one
and
worth
an
awfully
large
sum
of
money
sallie
went
on
to
remark
in
something
of
a
confidential
tone
as
if
getting
the
boys
ready
to
be
surprised
when
they
looked
upon
the
possessions
of
the
industrious
professor
and
oh
if
you
could
only
hear
all
the
queer
things
he
been
telling
us
that
happened
to
him
in
foreign
lands
when
he
was
spending
ever
so
much
money
and
long
weary
months
finding
these
very
rare
specimens
why
i
just
stand
there
and
look
at
them
and
wonder
how
people
can
be
so
foolish
when
it
seems
to
me
i
seen
much
prettier
butterflies
right
out
there
in
our
fields
where
the
thistles
are
blooming
it
seemed
that
the
room
they
had
given
the
wonderful
man
of
science
was
on
the
ground
floor
and
opened
off
the
parlor
the
two
boys
followed
sallie
in
and
noted
her
rather
awed
manner
evidently
the
professor
whether
he
turned
out
to
be
a
fraud
or
the
genuine
article
had
succeeded
in
arousing
both
her
admiration
and
wonder
the
room
was
plainly
yet
comfortably
furnished
but
evidently
the
professor
like
so
many
other
learned
savants
did
not
know
such
a
thing
as
order
existed
for
things
were
simply
he
just
wo
let
us
sweep
in
here
or
do
the
least
thing
explained
sallie
as
if
she
feared
the
boys
would
blame
her
for
the
looks
of
the
room
you
know
he
so
queer
and
he
says
we
might
lose
something
that
he
valued
very
highly
thinking
it
was
not
worth
keeping
but
here
the
little
case
containing
those
almost
priceless
specimens
he
collected
abroad
she
led
them
to
a
table
on
which
a
small
case
rested
leaning
against
the
wall
frank
took
one
look
apparently
the
sight
affected
him
strangely
for
immediately
he
bent
over
closer
as
though
to
feast
his
eyes
on
those
costly
trophies
which
the
college
professor
had
collected
in
foreign
lands
andy
saw
that
his
cousin
was
evidently
having
some
sort
of
a
silent
laughing
fit
for
he
shook
all
over
though
not
uttering
a
single
sound
what
ails
you
frank
he
whispered
taking
advantage
of
sallie
having
to
hurry
out
of
the
room
as
her
mother
voice
was
heard
calling
her
in
the
kitchen
i
tickled
to
death
to
meet
an
old
friend
again
that
all
replied
frank
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
seen
this
wonderful
collection
before
demanded
the
other
like
a
flash
as
it
were
i
most
certainly
do
and
if
you
stop
to
think
andy
i
guess
you
say
the
same
or
perhaps
now
you
did
happen
to
examine
the
case
as
closely
as
i
did
that
day
last
spring
when
we
crossed
over
to
cranford
to
pick
up
a
few
rare
stamps
for
our
collection
at
snyder
old
curio
store
why
bless
me
i
really
believe
you
right
i
seem
to
remember
seeing
it
in
the
show
window
now
when
we
were
looking
at
the
little
baskets
of
coins
andy
hastened
to
remark
there
is
the
least
shadow
of
a
doubt
about
it
added
frank
some
time
or
other
when
the
notion
came
to
this
man
to
play
the
part
of
a
butterfly
collector
which
perhaps
the
sight
of
the
things
brought
to
his
mind
he
just
stepped
into
snyder
store
and
bought
the
old
collection
why
it
has
got
a
single
specimen
that
you
ca
find
a
thousand
of
any
day
you
look
through
august
and
september
right
around
here
you
mean
frank
right
on
this
farm
in
fact
replied
the
other
with
a
wide
grin
think
of
the
nerve
of
this
learned
scientist
bringing
this
here
and
telling
that
it
represented
the
results
of
years
of
difficult
research
you
do
wonder
now
that
i
just
had
to
snicker
do
you
andy
chapter
xiv
a
clue
that
looks
bad
do
it
frank
andy
went
on
to
remark
as
he
first
glanced
at
the
bogus
collection
of
rare
specimens
and
then
eyed
his
cousin
humorously
one
thing
is
sure
no
man
would
go
to
the
trouble
and
expense
of
buying
even
a
dollar
case
of
common
butterflies
unless
he
had
some
deep
object
in
view
and
you
know
that
andy
this
professor
must
be
a
fraud
even
if
he
does
turn
out
to
be
the
man
we
think
he
is
perhaps
he
wanting
to
find
out
whether
hoskins
had
discovered
that
wonderful
gold
mine
well
you
need
grin
about
it
because
stranger
things
have
happened
i
guess
now
andy
ceased
laughing
and
turned
to
look
around
the
room
i
wonder
he
began
and
then
stopped
short
now
i
can
finish
your
sentence
for
you
said
frank
you
wonder
if
we
could
make
any
important
discovery
if
we
looked
around
here
a
bit
while
sallie
is
helping
her
ma
do
up
some
fruit
jars
or
something
like
that
perhaps
it
would
be
just
the
right
thing
suggested
andy
in
confusion
under
ordinary
conditions
it
certainly
would
his
cousin
went
on
to
say
but
when
you
got
a
pretty
good
idea
that
you
dealing
with
a
slippery
hobo
actor
and
now
a
bank
burglar
and
cracksman
in
general
why
that
puts
a
different
face
on
the
matter
do
you
see
my
boy
all
right
let
take
a
look
said
andy
easily
convinced
that
since
they
were
really
working
hand
in
glove
with
the
police
authorities
they
had
a
perfect
right
to
prowl
around
in
anybody
room
and
pick
up
such
valuable
information
as
could
be
found
afloat
but
after
all
they
found
nothing
that
looked
like
incriminating
evidence
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
the
professor
did
not
seem
to
own
any
sort
of
wardrobe
whatever
and
had
nothing
belonging
to
him
save
the
clothes
on
his
back
the
little
case
of
butterflies
which
frank
believed
he
had
bought
for
a
dollar
over
in
cranford
at
the
curio
dealer
shop
and
a
few
bottles
holding
some
strong
smelling
acids
which
possibly
were
used
to
either
kill
the
captured
butterflies
so
they
would
not
beat
their
wings
out
or
else
to
preserve
certain
specimens
of
bugs
he
expected
to
run
across
in
his
hunts
nothing
doing
said
andy
with
considerable
of
disgust
and
disappointment
in
his
voice
come
here
remarked
his
cousin
softly
hello
do
tell
me
you
found
something
and
andy
crossed
the
floor
in
more
or
less
haste
he
found
frank
bending
over
a
table
at
which
there
were
writing
materials
pen
envelopes
paper
and
a
blotter
what
doing
have
you
found
the
gentleman
notebook
lying
carelessly
around
and
which
we
can
peep
into
eh
frank
not
at
all
came
the
reply
i
was
only
looking
at
this
blotter
whatever
is
there
funny
about
that
demanded
the
other
in
puzzled
tones
as
he
glanced
first
at
the
object
in
question
and
then
up
at
the
face
of
his
chum
it
was
a
new
one
or
nearly
so
you
see
and
somebody
has
been
writing
heavily
and
then
pressing
the
blotter
over
it
frank
went
on
and
if
you
could
read
backwards
now
you
might
make
out
what
they
said
is
that
it
frank
oh
that
part
is
as
easy
as
falling
off
a
log
i
held
it
up
to
the
looking
glass
here
see
if
you
can
make
it
out
andy
hardly
had
the
other
looked
than
he
started
to
read
interjecting
remarks
of
his
own
as
he
proceeded
some
words
missing
looks
like
frank
let
see
on
siding
at
wed
he
says
keep
low
and
trust
to
him
throw
track
mum
that
all
i
can
make
out
because
he
sign
any
name
it
seems
whatever
do
you
make
of
all
that
stuff
frank
first
of
all
frank
pulled
out
a
pencil
and
copied
the
marks
upon
a
piece
of
paper
which
he
thrust
into
his
pocket
he
might
miss
the
blotter
if
i
cribbed
it
and
take
the
alarm
he
explained
as
he
hastened
to
put
the
article
in
question
back
on
the
table
lest
sallie
come
in
at
any
minute
and
discover
what
they
were
doing
taking
liberties
in
the
room
of
the
boarder
and
then
she
would
have
to
be
told
everything
which
might
work
out
badly
frank
feared
but
i
reckon
you
got
some
sort
of
idea
what
that
writing
means
frank
pursued
the
other
bird
boy
who
once
he
started
on
a
subject
could
no
more
be
shaken
off
than
a
bulldog
of
course
i
have
and
it
given
me
something
of
a
shock
too
let
me
tell
you
andy
first
of
all
you
may
know
that
this
very
day
is
wednesday
the
day
he
mentions
there
to
be
sure
it
is
but
frank
can
all
this
have
some
reference
to
another
crime
they
mean
to
commit
i
afraid
it
does
came
the
reluctant
reply
tell
me
what
he
means
by
siding
track
mum
and
all
that
of
course
i
can
understand
that
he
warns
the
fellow
he
sending
the
message
to
to
keep
quiet
what
car
can
he
mean
do
you
think
they
aim
to
steal
some
one
expensive
car
now
that
they
gone
and
wrecked
percy
biplane
and
must
have
another
means
for
getting
away
but
frank
simply
shook
his
head
at
that
oh
you
away
off
your
base
there
andy
he
speaks
of
a
car
on
a
siding
and
that
can
only
refer
to
a
railroad
car
now
i
happen
to
know
that
they
expect
the
to
be
along
some
time
today
or
tonight
and
it
always
lies
there
on
that
jeffreys
siding
until
they
passed
out
thousands
of
dollars
to
the
men
who
call
bloomsbury
their
headquarters
do
you
see
now
what
it
must
mean
andy
andy
gasped
and
then
exclaimed
once
more
you
gone
and
seen
through
the
riddle
that
knocked
me
silly
frank
that
just
what
it
must
mean
the
would
offer
fat
pickings
all
in
cash
and
they
held
up
their
flight
to
canada
just
to
try
and
gobble
it
oh
what
a
slick
game
with
todd
giving
false
information
and
perhaps
just
leading
the
police
further
and
further
away
from
bloomsbury
tonight
so
as
to
leave
the
next
to
unprotected
yes
and
does
he
go
on
like
this
says
keep
low
and
trust
to
him
that
must
mean
todd
do
you
think
i
read
it
that
way
replied
his
cousin
tersely
as
he
rubbed
his
chin
in
a
reflective
fashion
for
they
were
now
grappling
with
a
dangerous
problem
and
frank
was
only
too
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
a
slip
might
upset
all
calculations
as
well
as
possibly
endanger
their
lives
since
they
were
dealing
with
reckless
men
and
no
boyish
rivals
like
percy
carberry
and
sandy
hollingshead
do
you
think
this
was
meant
for
the
other
one
of
the
bank
thieves
andy
went
on
to
ask
it
could
hardly
have
been
for
any
one
else
andy
there
must
have
been
more
to
the
letter
but
the
rest
dried
before
he
blotted
it
and
that
fellow
is
in
hiding
somewhere
perhaps
watching
the
biplane
and
ready
to
fight
before
letting
it
be
retaken
because
they
depend
on
it
for
their
to
the
great
lakes
and
canada
andy
further
observed
yes
just
as
you
say
the
other
remarked
and
now
since
we
learned
this
much
frank
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
try
and
find
where
the
stolen
biplane
is
and
do
something
so
as
to
make
it
no
good
for
their
purpose
or
just
slip
away
go
round
a
little
like
we
were
just
out
for
a
spin
and
getting
back
to
bloomsbury
put
them
wise
neither
just
yet
anyhow
the
older
bird
boy
remarked
not
the
first
because
it
would
be
taking
big
chances
if
as
we
believe
one
of
the
robbers
is
concealed
near
where
the
stolen
biplane
may
happen
to
be
lying
partly
hidden
with
dead
leaves
so
it
could
be
noticed
from
above
and
he
would
be
apt
to
do
something
we
find
unpleasant
and
as
for
going
back
and
telling
we
have
to
be
mighty
careful
there
and
why
frank
well
to
begin
with
even
the
walls
have
ears
they
say
and
if
the
police
were
suddenly
called
back
from
their
hunt
to
the
southwest
the
fact
might
get
to
the
robbers
and
you
know
what
would
happen
then
oh
said
andy
shrugging
his
shoulders
i
suppose
they
just
throw
this
second
job
up
and
cut
stick
for
canada
as
fast
as
they
could
make
the
aeroplane
spin
which
would
be
too
bad
for
chief
waller
and
joe
green
and
the
rest
of
that
bunch
at
headquarters
who
are
already
figuring
on
how
they
spend
their
reward
money
they
hope
to
get
when
the
bank
pays
for
the
two
thieves
but
perhaps
if
we
just
told
our
fathers
andy
they
might
get
a
few
bold
men
together
and
lay
a
beautiful
trap
for
the
fellows
so
that
when
they
broke
into
the
they
would
be
made
prisoners
bully
idea
that
frank
and
i
hope
you
decide
to
carry
it
out
just
to
think
what
a
pleasant
surprise
it
would
be
for
our
butterfly
collector
expecting
that
he
was
going
in
to
gather
in
another
lot
of
plunder
and
then
to
hear
a
voice
say
to
him
up
you
our
prisoners
oh
would
i
like
to
be
when
that
happens
wonder
if
they
would
let
us
have
a
part
in
the
proceedings
after
we
brought
the
news
that
upset
the
plans
of
the
yeggmen
that
will
do
for
just
now
andy
because
here
comes
sally
again
be
gaping
at
the
wonderful
collection
that
almost
cost
the
professor
his
very
life
in
all
sorts
of
hot
countries
as
well
as
a
whole
pocket
full
of
money
if
you
do
care
what
you
say
and
when
the
farmer
daughter
did
enter
the
room
a
minute
later
she
saw
the
two
boys
standing
there
a
rapt
look
of
admiration
and
envy
on
their
faces
as
they
stared
at
the
little
case
of
common
local
butterflies
which
possibly
some
boy
had
gathered
together
and
then
disposed
of
for
a
song
while
the
young
aviators
had
in
this
fashion
about
decided
on
their
plan
of
action
they
saw
no
reason
for
any
hurry
the
day
was
still
long
and
when
they
felt
like
starting
toward
home
it
would
take
them
but
a
very
short
time
to
get
there
meanwhile
there
seemed
to
be
some
sort
of
fascination
holding
them
to
the
neighborhood
of
the
hoskins
farm
and
when
they
went
away
a
little
later
it
would
be
with
the
idea
of
hanging
about
and
seeing
if
the
odd
little
professor
might
not
come
along
both
of
them
thought
they
would
like
to
look
at
him
the
man
who
was
capable
of
playing
such
a
clever
game
as
this
must
surely
be
worth
seeing
then
again
the
fact
that
casper
blue
once
upon
a
time
had
been
a
daring
birdman
had
something
to
do
with
this
interest
on
the
part
of
frank
and
his
cousin
because
there
is
always
a
certain
fellow
feeling
between
those
who
are
engaged
in
the
same
dangerous
pursuits
but
possibly
andy
on
his
part
was
hoping
secretly
that
by
spying
around
they
might
be
able
in
some
way
to
learn
where
the
yeggmen
had
hidden
the
plunder
they
had
taken
from
the
looted
bloomsbury
bank
chapter
xv
when
casper
came
back
although
the
bird
boys
had
more
than
once
before
proved
that
they
possessed
all
the
courage
and
daring
a
successful
aviator
must
have
in
order
to
accomplish
the
difficult
tasks
hourly
presented
to
him
for
solution
it
must
not
be
thought
that
they
were
reckless
to
any
degree
andy
might
be
slightly
inclined
that
way
but
frank
was
an
exceedingly
careful
navigator
of
the
air
and
by
degrees
his
influence
was
even
affecting
his
younger
cousin
as
example
always
will
when
however
a
situation
suddenly
arose
that
absolutely
required
a
display
of
daring
these
young
air
pilots
were
there
with
the
punch
as
andy
termed
it
they
had
learned
how
to
volplane
earthward
from
a
dizzy
height
with
absolute
safety
when
conditions
were
just
right
and
necessity
required
a
quick
descent
on
a
few
occasions
frank
had
even
been
known
to
hazard
what
is
known
as
the
death
dip
but
it
was
only
when
there
happened
to
be
a
good
reason
for
taking
such
chances
and
not
merely
in
a
spirit
of
such
as
many
show
aviators
employ
just
to
send
a
shiver
of
dread
through
the
spectators
and
then
laugh
recklessly
at
the
fears
their
boldness
had
aroused
of
course
they
might
have
decided
to
immediately
return
to
bloomsbury
and
give
information
concerning
the
extent
of
their
discoveries
since
coming
to
the
hoskins
farm
perhaps
that
would
have
been
the
wisest
move
they
could
make
but
both
boys
were
rather
opposed
to
carrying
it
out
just
then
the
afternoon
was
wholly
before
them
and
who
could
tell
what
change
of
plans
the
two
yeggmen
might
make
before
the
coming
of
the
night
should
they
get
wind
of
the
presence
of
the
bird
boys
in
the
vicinity
possibly
they
would
take
alarm
and
hurrying
to
their
concealed
biplane
make
for
the
far
north
with
all
haste
and
in
this
way
if
no
one
knew
of
their
departure
the
intended
ambuscade
that
night
in
the
vicinity
of
the
railroad
would
be
laid
in
vain
that
was
really
what
the
boys
feared
the
most
that
their
quarry
slip
off
in
secret
when
they
were
far
away
frank
was
indeed
trying
to
figure
out
whether
it
would
not
be
best
after
all
for
him
to
stay
by
the
hydroplane
on
guard
as
it
were
while
andy
by
using
a
horse
if
the
hoskins
happened
to
still
possess
such
an
animal
managed
to
get
to
another
farm
where
they
were
enough
to
have
a
telephone
in
the
house
by
means
of
which
he
could
get
in
touch
with
bird
or
judge
lawson
in
bloomsbury
then
again
there
was
always
a
slight
chance
that
this
pretended
professor
might
have
seen
them
descend
while
he
was
wandering
around
once
an
airman
and
just
by
instinct
as
it
were
the
eyes
are
almost
constantly
searching
the
heavens
perhaps
for
a
glimpse
of
other
adventurous
craft
or
it
may
be
signs
that
give
warning
of
treacherous
winds
gathering
storms
or
similar
things
that
must
always
be
of
intense
interest
to
an
aviator
and
so
while
casper
blue
had
long
since
given
up
taking
hazards
in
a
flying
machine
to
indulge
in
even
more
dangerous
business
as
a
bank
robber
still
habits
would
cling
tightly
and
thus
he
might
have
seen
more
than
the
ordinary
man
could
have
done
of
course
even
though
he
sought
the
hydroplane
and
found
it
lying
there
in
the
field
he
could
not
very
well
make
any
use
of
it
so
long
as
frank
held
the
missing
part
in
his
possession
but
he
could
in
a
spirit
of
maliciousness
so
utterly
destroy
the
planes
and
even
injure
the
powerful
little
kinkaid
engine
that
it
would
be
practically
fit
only
for
the
afterwards
and
that
was
giving
frank
more
or
less
concern
even
while
he
continued
to
linger
at
the
farmhouse
because
andy
wished
to
prowl
around
a
little
while
longer
in
hopes
of
getting
some
clue
to
the
location
of
the
cache
where
the
thieves
had
hidden
their
plunder
sallie
saw
nothing
strange
in
this
apparent
desire
of
andy
to
hang
around
she
was
rather
a
pretty
little
thing
and
of
course
knew
it
so
that
she
may
have
believed
the
witchery
of
her
attractions
had
more
or
less
to
do
with
the
matter
even
when
frank
asked
so
many
queer
questions
about
the
absent
boarder
sallie
was
not
wise
enough
to
understand
that
the
boys
were
much
more
concerned
about
how
professor
whitesides
amused
himself
where
his
favorite
lounging
places
seemed
to
be
and
all
that
rather
than
in
her
pretty
face
and
merry
laugh
her
mother
must
have
counted
on
having
her
assistance
in
carrying
on
her
task
of
putting
up
preserves
in
the
kitchen
for
once
more
she
called
to
sallie
to
come
and
lend
a
hand
for
a
few
moments
this
left
the
two
boys
alone
again
and
gave
them
a
chance
for
exchanging
views
which
they
were
not
slow
to
do
i
guess
he
does
keep
it
around
here
in
this
room
or
anywhere
close
by
was
andy
first
remark
frank
chuckled
on
hearing
this
oh
i
see
that
you
got
your
mind
set
on
recovering
what
was
taken
from
the
bank
you
a
mercenary
fellow
andy
but
then
since
our
fathers
have
more
or
less
interest
in
the
same
bank
which
is
going
to
be
mighty
badly
crippled
if
the
cash
and
securities
are
not
recovered
sooner
or
later
why
i
ca
blame
you
much
i
like
to
run
across
the
loot
myself
more
than
i
can
tell
you
i
only
afraid
that
if
the
men
are
taken
prisoners
to
night
when
they
come
to
clean
out
the
after
it
arrives
in
bloomsbury
not
have
this
other
stuff
with
them
and
will
refuse
to
tell
where
hidden
that
will
be
just
as
bad
for
the
bank
as
if
they
got
away
to
canada
with
the
swag
as
the
chief
calls
it
i
wish
i
knew
how
we
could
track
this
casper
blue
to
where
the
other
yegg
is
hiding
near
the
biplane
and
watch
them
until
we
saw
where
they
had
the
cache
after
that
we
could
just
hang
around
and
when
they
started
in
a
perhaps
for
bloomsbury
with
todd
pemberton
at
the
wheel
we
could
do
something
to
make
the
biplane
useless
to
them
and
then
toward
evening
put
for
home
ourselves
frank
listened
while
the
other
ran
all
of
this
off
and
evidently
he
was
more
or
less
amused
at
what
he
heard
it
plain
to
be
seen
that
you
been
doing
some
tall
thinking
and
planning
all
this
while
andy
he
remarked
but
you
admit
i
guess
that
if
there
was
any
way
to
carry
out
my
scheme
it
would
be
a
jim
dandy
idea
the
other
persisted
of
course
but
that
where
the
trouble
lies
even
if
casper
did
come
back
we
never
could
track
him
through
the
woods
and
around
the
swamps
without
his
sooner
or
later
discovering
that
he
was
being
followed
because
we
not
clever
at
that
sort
of
thing
and
once
he
got
wind
of
our
being
after
him
chances
are
he
lay
some
trap
with
his
mate
into
which
both
of
us
would
tumble
headlong
andy
scratched
his
head
and
a
look
of
doubt
came
upon
his
face
h
i
would
like
that
one
little
bit
and
that
a
fact
frank
he
admitted
candidly
if
we
fell
into
their
hands
and
were
kicked
around
and
then
left
tied
up
like
a
pair
of
mummies
from
the
pyramids
of
egypt
while
they
went
and
cleaned
out
that
and
sailed
away
for
canda
oh
excuse
me
if
you
please
anything
but
that
the
laugh
would
sure
be
on
the
bird
boys
i
do
mind
posing
once
in
a
while
as
a
hero
but
it
would
jar
me
a
whole
lot
to
know
that
people
were
pointing
me
out
and
telling
how
nicely
these
wonderful
bird
boys
had
been
taken
in
and
done
for
by
a
couple
of
traveling
yeggs
have
it
your
own
way
frank
and
do
pay
any
attention
to
my
silly
schemes
your
ideas
are
all
right
andy
but
the
only
trouble
is
they
are
too
strong
for
a
couple
of
boys
to
carry
out
i
think
we
be
wise
to
play
safe
more
games
are
won
in
the
long
run
that
way
than
by
being
dashing
and
venturesome
of
course
you
right
and
as
i
had
my
little
fling
and
got
it
out
of
my
system
let
work
along
the
sensible
lines
you
laid
out
frank
that
was
just
like
andy
he
might
occasionally
seem
to
yearn
to
break
loose
and
take
a
wild
flight
but
on
second
sober
thought
he
nearly
always
came
back
to
his
cousin
way
of
thinking
sallie
still
remained
in
the
kitchen
so
that
they
were
able
to
keep
on
talking
without
any
fear
of
being
interrupted
or
overheard
i
wondering
if
percy
will
ever
have
the
chance
to
handle
his
farman
biplane
again
andy
went
on
to
remark
he
seemed
to
set
a
great
store
by
it
to
offer
such
a
nice
fat
reward
for
its
return
and
it
so
brand
new
that
he
has
had
much
of
a
chance
to
try
it
out
was
he
mad
though
when
he
came
racing
along
in
that
car
looking
for
chief
waller
he
looked
as
red
as
a
turkey
gobbler
just
to
think
that
while
he
was
up
there
with
three
of
his
cronies
trying
to
injure
our
machine
those
yeggs
were
fixing
it
all
up
so
that
they
could
get
his
biplane
if
they
missed
ours
it
a
rich
joke
on
perc
oh
i
hope
he
gets
it
back
again
safe
and
sound
said
frank
life
would
be
rather
tame
for
us
around
home
here
if
we
did
have
percy
to
think
about
for
a
long
time
now
he
kept
us
guessing
and
we
feel
a
little
lonely
if
he
gave
up
flying
guess
you
right
there
frank
it
would
seem
humdrum
like
if
we
did
have
to
think
of
him
every
little
while
and
what
new
schemes
he
was
planning
to
get
the
better
of
the
bird
boys
and
say
some
of
his
games
kind
of
dazzle
a
fellow
if
only
there
was
so
much
meanness
about
when
perc
gets
to
hating
a
fellow
he
does
stop
half
way
but
goes
the
whole
hog
why
more
than
a
few
times
he
given
us
a
big
scare
trying
to
do
some
stunt
that
would
make
us
look
small
and
at
the
risk
of
sending
us
all
down
a
thousand
or
two
feet
after
all
beginning
to
believe
i
sleep
sounder
if
percy
carberry
took
to
some
other
play
and
let
aeroplanes
alone
well
he
seems
just
as
wild
about
them
as
ever
and
so
i
reckon
just
keep
on
bothering
us
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
but
what
are
you
looking
at
andy
and
frank
also
turned
his
eyes
down
toward
the
fringe
of
quince
trees
that
marked
the
old
lane
leading
to
the
barnyard
from
the
road
i
thought
i
saw
some
one
coming
over
there
and
if
it
turned
out
to
be
our
good
friend
the
profess
we
be
wise
to
skip
out
before
he
sighted
us
frank
here
let
step
back
out
of
sight
anyhow
so
as
to
be
ready
to
slip
away
if
it
is
our
man
and
frank
drew
his
companion
around
the
corner
of
the
house
from
which
point
they
could
still
keep
watch
over
the
lane
half
a
minute
later
andy
whispered
there
i
saw
him
again
frank
and
as
sure
as
anything
it
must
be
casper
he
a
little
man
wearing
brown
glasses
to
keep
the
bright
sun
from
his
eyes
and
yes
he
carrying
a
butterfly
catcher
net
over
his
shoulder
shall
we
disappear
i
think
that
would
be
our
best
move
andy
and
lucky
enough
we
got
the
chance
to
slip
around
here
and
get
back
of
the
barn
before
he
comes
along
with
which
the
two
boys
hastened
to
follow
out
the
plan
suggested
chapter
xvi
throwing
off
the
mask
do
you
think
he
saw
us
frank
asked
andy
after
they
had
found
a
place
where
they
could
peep
around
a
corner
without
being
discovered
well
that
more
than
i
can
say
the
other
replied
we
took
every
precaution
and
unless
he
has
mighty
sharp
eyes
he
could
have
glimpsed
us
and
you
think
it
safe
for
us
to
stay
here
eh
frank
certainly
replied
the
other
we
in
a
position
to
make
a
move
any
old
way
from
here
there
is
one
chance
in
ten
of
his
coming
around
the
corner
and
if
he
does
make
a
show
of
doing
that
why
we
can
be
sitting
here
playing
or
something
like
that
just
as
if
we
did
care
whether
school
kept
or
not
bully
for
that
who
cares
for
expenses
look
frank
i
was
right
you
see
for
it
was
the
little
profess
after
all
yes
sure
enough
careful
now
andy
and
do
let
him
see
you
peeping
that
give
the
whole
thing
away
quicker
than
anything
else
they
had
both
selected
positions
where
they
could
see
without
attracting
attention
and
it
was
with
considerable
eagerness
that
they
fastened
their
eyes
on
the
figure
of
the
small
wiry
man
who
was
sauntering
along
toward
the
farmhouse
carrying
a
across
one
shoulder
while
with
his
other
hand
he
held
a
black
case
which
as
sallie
said
contained
his
more
recent
captures
in
the
way
of
beautiful
and
rare
moths
and
insects
that
his
stiff
arm
frank
see
how
he
moves
it
the
one
hanging
down
i
mean
with
black
box
good
gracious
now
i
wonder
whispered
frank
not
so
loud
he
might
hear
you
not
with
the
roosters
crowing
like
they
are
said
andy
confidently
but
just
glimpse
the
black
box
would
you
frank
i
am
looking
returned
the
other
he
calls
it
the
receiver
for
his
new
butterflies
but
looks
more
like
a
kodak
to
me
andy
went
on
but
d
know
what
i
thought
frank
tell
me
whispered
the
other
still
watching
the
professor
who
had
come
to
a
stop
at
some
little
distance
away
and
seemed
to
be
busily
engaged
looking
back
of
him
as
though
laying
out
plans
for
an
afternoon
campaign
among
the
bright
winged
butterflies
why
how
easy
for
him
to
tear
out
the
inside
works
of
a
camera
box
like
that
and
make
use
of
it
for
a
better
purpose
see
andy
went
on
to
say
oh
now
you
got
a
bright
thought
for
a
fact
frank
sent
back
careful
not
to
raise
his
voice
above
that
cautious
pitch
well
it
could
be
done
and
i
guess
that
little
black
box
hold
about
all
the
money
and
securities
that
the
bank
lost
they
say
the
thieves
only
picked
out
the
papers
they
could
dispose
of
and
left
all
the
rest
which
would
indicate
that
the
second
yegg
must
have
been
in
the
banking
line
some
time
or
other
and
knew
what
was
what
he
coming
on
again
lie
low
now
andy
accordingly
both
of
them
remained
perfectly
motionless
as
the
professor
advanced
toward
the
house
had
he
shown
any
disposition
to
head
toward
that
particular
corner
frank
was
ready
to
assume
an
attitude
of
indifference
and
appear
to
be
engaged
in
some
boyish
game
with
his
jack
knife
tossing
it
up
in
the
air
and
causing
the
point
of
the
long
blade
to
stick
upright
in
the
ground
but
the
small
man
with
the
brown
glasses
and
the
butterfly
net
made
straight
for
the
front
porch
of
the
house
and
passed
in
at
the
door
just
as
though
he
felt
perfectly
at
home
there
well
what
next
remarked
andy
for
reply
the
other
beckoned
and
started
hurriedly
to
gain
the
shelter
of
the
woodshed
near
by
what
this
for
questioned
andy
when
they
were
once
more
crouched
down
in
a
position
where
they
could
not
be
easily
seen
stop
and
think
answered
the
other
if
he
just
happened
to
look
out
of
a
window
on
this
side
of
the
house
he
see
us
easily
and
our
suspicious
actions
would
tell
him
we
were
on
to
his
game
now
even
if
he
looks
he
wo
see
anything
huh
and
do
we
stay
here
all
afternoon
just
doing
nothing
while
he
taking
a
nap
indoors
grumbled
the
other
who
wanted
to
be
moving
and
was
never
satisfied
when
not
in
action
wait
was
all
frank
would
say
perhaps
he
could
see
further
ahead
than
his
cousin
and
guessed
something
of
what
was
likely
to
occur
they
had
not
taken
pains
to
warn
sallie
or
her
mother
to
keep
from
mentioning
the
fact
of
their
happening
around
and
chances
were
that
as
soon
as
casper
blue
heard
that
the
bird
boys
had
dropped
in
he
would
become
immediately
suspicious
on
questioning
the
girl
he
would
be
apt
to
learn
how
curious
frank
and
andy
had
seemed
about
him
and
sallie
might
even
admit
that
they
had
asked
to
see
his
wonderful
collection
of
rare
and
costly
butterflies
well
if
such
a
thing
did
occur
of
course
the
man
would
immediately
know
that
the
cat
was
out
of
the
bag
realizing
that
there
must
be
a
great
hue
and
cry
throughout
the
entire
county
just
then
with
reference
to
the
yeggs
who
had
looted
the
bank
he
could
easily
imagine
what
had
brought
these
boys
here
through
association
with
todd
pemberton
casper
must
have
learned
a
whole
lot
with
regard
to
frank
and
his
cousin
being
an
aviator
himself
he
would
naturally
take
an
immediate
interest
in
boys
who
had
given
such
a
good
account
of
themselves
in
the
field
of
aeronautics
the
attempt
to
steal
the
hydroplane
in
the
first
place
before
they
turned
to
percy
carberry
biplane
proved
that
they
knew
all
about
the
bird
boys
and
so
learning
of
their
presence
would
immediately
give
casper
warning
that
his
hideout
was
no
longer
a
secret
but
that
the
net
of
the
law
must
be
closing
around
him
what
then
would
he
like
a
desperate
man
attempt
to
capture
these
venturesome
lads
so
as
to
keep
them
from
informing
the
authorities
at
bloomsbury
either
that
or
else
he
would
think
that
since
the
game
was
up
and
they
could
no
longer
loiter
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
aroused
district
in
order
to
carry
out
the
second
part
of
the
great
scheme
they
had
better
take
to
the
aeroplane
and
vanish
from
view
leaving
no
trail
behind
by
means
of
which
they
could
be
followed
frank
had
said
all
this
in
his
mind
when
he
lay
there
and
waited
to
see
what
would
turn
up
he
felt
that
they
could
surely
afford
to
linger
for
some
time
if
there
was
any
chance
of
learning
whether
the
yeggmen
meant
to
change
their
plans
or
proceed
to
carry
out
their
original
scheme
all
seemed
quiet
at
the
farmhouse
sallie
had
come
out
on
the
porch
and
looked
rather
disappointed
to
find
that
the
two
boys
had
strangely
vanished
she
stood
there
glancing
around
in
a
puzzled
manner
for
several
minutes
and
then
with
a
pretty
shrug
of
her
shoulders
and
a
pout
of
her
lips
whirled
about
and
went
back
into
the
house
again
wow
said
andy
in
a
low
tone
she
got
it
in
for
you
frank
because
you
dropped
out
of
sight
without
even
so
much
as
saying
goodbye
but
the
other
was
thinking
of
weightier
matters
than
the
humor
of
a
little
coquette
he
wondered
whether
sallie
would
run
across
the
professor
and
ask
him
if
he
had
met
two
boys
down
the
lane
which
remark
would
excite
his
suspicions
and
lead
to
other
questions
now
on
his
part
if
nothing
happened
inside
of
half
an
hour
frank
was
of
a
mind
to
try
the
plan
that
had
come
to
him
sending
andy
off
to
try
and
reach
some
other
farm
where
they
would
have
a
telephone
while
he
himself
remained
to
keep
watch
that
might
necessitate
taking
sallie
into
their
confidence
for
they
would
need
to
ask
questions
and
perhaps
borrow
a
horse
on
second
thought
frank
was
now
a
little
sorry
he
had
not
seen
fit
to
tell
the
girl
all
she
seemed
to
be
fairly
clever
and
could
possibly
keep
a
secret
at
any
rate
the
chances
of
discovery
would
not
be
nearly
so
serious
as
now
when
in
her
ignorance
she
was
likely
to
blurt
out
all
about
the
boys
having
been
there
without
knowing
that
in
so
doing
she
might
be
assisting
clever
yeggmen
to
avoid
arrest
the
seconds
moved
along
and
changed
into
minutes
if
the
professor
had
come
to
a
window
on
that
side
of
the
house
to
look
anxiously
around
he
must
have
been
careful
not
to
expose
himself
for
though
frank
had
kept
a
keen
lookout
he
had
failed
to
see
anything
of
him
it
was
getting
very
much
of
a
bore
to
andy
he
changed
his
position
restlessly
several
times
as
though
he
wished
frank
would
make
some
sort
of
a
move
he
hardly
cared
what
its
nature
so
long
as
it
meant
action
but
although
andy
could
not
see
it
at
that
moment
there
were
lively
enough
times
ahead
of
them
to
please
even
his
impetuous
nature
and
the
passage
of
every
minute
brought
the
crisis
closer
and
closer
once
frank
believed
he
heard
loud
voices
inside
the
farmhouse
and
at
the
same
time
some
one
was
certainly
hurrying
back
and
forth
but
then
possibly
that
might
be
only
sallie
obeying
another
call
from
the
kitchen
where
the
good
woman
was
so
busily
engaged
with
her
canning
operations
something
like
twenty
minutes
must
have
passed
since
the
boys
made
their
change
of
base
to
andy
it
was
much
longer
for
he
felt
the
time
pass
as
though
it
had
leaden
wings
then
frank
watching
saw
some
one
come
hastily
out
of
the
front
door
pass
quickly
down
to
the
path
and
move
away
in
the
direction
of
the
lane
he
going
off
frank
exclaimed
andy
all
excitement
just
as
though
he
half
expected
that
his
companion
would
give
the
word
that
meant
an
immediate
pursuit
yes
keep
quiet
andy
but
he
give
us
the
slip
do
you
see
persisted
the
other
let
him
then
we
ca
help
it
you
can
see
that
he
made
quite
a
change
in
his
looks
as
though
he
thrown
the
mask
off
and
expect
to
play
the
part
of
a
collegeman
and
a
bug
collector
any
more
frank
whispered
that
so
he
has
got
the
brown
glasses
on
and
that
old
butterfly
net
is
missing
but
frank
just
notice
wo
you
how
he
hangs
to
that
little
black
box
say
perhaps
i
was
right
after
all
perhaps
casper
blue
is
carrying
all
that
stuff
cribbed
from
the
bloomsbury
bank
inside
the
same
the
two
boys
crouched
there
behind
the
woodshed
and
by
cautiously
peeping
around
the
corner
could
watch
the
late
boarder
of
the
hoskins
hurrying
down
the
lane
as
though
he
had
received
a
hasty
summons
from
the
president
of
his
college
demanding
an
immediate
return
he
seemed
uneasy
and
suspicious
for
several
times
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
this
way
and
that
as
though
half
expecting
to
discover
some
person
ready
to
dispute
his
departure
and
frank
also
noted
the
way
one
of
his
hands
had
of
keeping
in
the
pocket
of
his
short
coat
just
for
all
the
world
as
though
he
might
be
grasping
some
sort
of
pistol
that
was
concealed
there
chapter
xvii
sallie
rides
bareback
and
now
what
our
next
move
demanded
andy
who
generally
found
it
very
nice
to
let
frank
do
all
the
planning
though
capable
of
taking
hold
himself
when
forced
to
do
it
fortunately
frank
had
a
great
way
of
figuring
out
what
he
would
do
under
certain
conditions
this
gave
some
sort
of
assurance
when
difficulties
arose
for
there
was
little
time
lost
in
fixing
things
up
so
as
to
have
a
programme
no
use
trying
to
follow
after
him
to
begin
with
he
declared
why
do
you
say
that
his
cousin
wanted
to
know
first
of
all
it
would
be
a
bad
business
because
he
on
his
guard
and
a
desperate
man
frank
went
on
to
explain
you
can
see
that
ready
to
pull
out
a
weapon
of
some
sort
at
the
first
warning
and
we
settled
that
we
did
want
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
these
two
bad
men
so
we
have
to
arrange
things
along
a
different
line
and
anyhow
there
no
terrible
hurry
because
i
rather
guess
they
got
the
biplane
hidden
some
distance
away
from
here
it
would
take
half
an
hour
perhaps
much
more
before
they
could
get
out
and
we
can
reach
our
craft
in
a
few
minutes
if
pushed
yes
that
all
so
frank
but
go
on
and
tell
me
the
rest
i
was
thinking
that
we
ought
to
try
and
let
our
folks
know
how
things
are
going
with
us
so
that
if
we
have
to
cut
out
after
these
yegg
aviators
they
know
where
we
gone
suppose
now
you
hunt
sallie
up
and
try
to
explain
it
all
to
her
just
as
fast
as
you
can
who
me
oh
well
i
guess
i
can
do
it
if
i
have
to
but
what
will
you
be
doing
all
that
time
frank
i
want
to
write
a
message
to
either
your
father
or
else
judge
lawson
whichever
she
can
get
on
the
phone
replied
the
other
immediately
hunting
in
his
pockets
for
pencil
and
paper
which
he
made
it
a
habit
to
carry
around
with
him
always
she
say
do
you
mean
sallie
frank
no
other
you
must
coax
her
to
saddle
up
a
horse
and
make
for
the
nearest
neighbor
where
they
got
a
phone
get
that
andy
but
do
you
think
she
will
asked
the
other
dubiously
i
dead
sure
of
it
came
the
confident
reply
sallie
has
a
touch
of
romance
in
her
and
besides
shell
be
so
mad
to
think
of
that
man
deceiving
her
mother
that
she
want
to
have
him
caught
get
along
with
you
now
andy
and
fix
it
all
up
inside
of
ten
minutes
i
have
the
message
written
out
by
that
time
so
she
can
start
if
there
such
a
thing
as
any
kind
of
a
horse
around
this
wreck
of
a
farm
and
so
andy
glad
at
least
to
have
something
to
do
hurried
toward
the
house
to
look
for
the
country
girl
left
alone
frank
continued
to
write
as
plainly
as
he
could
what
he
wanted
those
in
bloomsbury
to
know
about
matters
in
general
he
used
as
few
words
to
cover
the
case
as
possible
but
gave
the
leading
points
even
to
stating
his
fear
that
the
scoundrels
who
had
robbed
the
bank
and
were
plotting
to
also
make
a
descent
on
the
of
the
railroad
that
night
had
now
taken
the
alarm
and
would
be
off
in
the
stolen
biplane
in
that
event
frank
wanted
the
police
in
bloomsbury
to
know
that
he
and
andy
had
started
in
pursuit
though
what
they
could
do
to
apprehend
the
rogues
of
course
he
was
in
no
position
to
declare
by
the
time
he
had
this
finished
to
his
satisfaction
he
heard
voices
near
by
and
was
glad
to
see
his
cousin
coming
accompanied
by
sallie
the
girl
looked
duly
excited
just
as
frank
had
expected
there
were
a
thousand
questions
in
her
eyes
but
he
cut
all
this
short
we
ca
stop
to
tell
you
any
more
now
sallie
but
we
promise
to
drop
in
again
after
it
over
and
explain
all
that
seems
queer
to
you
now
here
the
message
that
we
want
to
get
to
bloomsbury
the
worst
kind
and
as
quick
as
you
could
get
on
a
horse
and
ride
to
the
nearest
neighbor
who
has
a
phone
in
the
house
you
do
this
for
us
wo
you
sallie
few
people
could
say
no
to
frank
once
he
wore
that
winning
smile
and
sallie
immediately
declared
that
she
was
ready
to
do
anything
he
suggested
to
think
of
that
little
scoundrel
fooling
us
all
and
pretending
to
be
a
college
professor
she
remarked
indignation
flashing
from
her
black
eyes
i
hope
you
got
a
horse
said
frank
sticking
to
the
business
in
hand
oh
yes
we
have
one
left
that
might
do
sallie
answered
then
let
get
him
saddled
right
away
frank
went
on
ca
she
snapped
back
ai
such
a
thing
as
a
saddle
around
here
any
more
but
i
a
country
girl
you
know
and
i
can
ride
bareback
all
right
a
halter
the
only
bridle
i
want
frank
give
me
the
message
and
i
see
that
it
gets
to
somebody
in
bloomsbury
and
here
some
money
sallie
the
other
went
on
what
do
you
think
there
might
be
something
to
pay
you
know
and
we
ca
afford
to
take
chances
when
there
so
much
at
stake
thank
you
a
thousand
times
for
helping
us
out
sallie
now
please
get
the
horse
i
like
to
see
you
started
before
we
pull
out
because
we
may
have
to
chase
after
these
fellows
in
our
aeroplane
if
they
take
a
notion
to
fly
away
the
girl
hastened
to
lead
the
way
into
the
stable
where
they
did
find
an
apology
for
a
horse
which
she
immediately
unhitched
and
led
outside
hope
she
does
happen
to
run
across
that
man
on
the
way
because
he
might
wonder
what
was
taking
her
off
like
that
and
do
something
to
turn
her
back
what
if
he
found
your
message
on
her
frank
and
andy
as
he
said
this
turned
an
anxious
gaze
upon
his
cousin
but
frank
shook
his
head
i
saw
him
dodge
out
of
the
lane
and
take
to
the
woods
he
remarked
as
though
he
knew
of
a
across
lots
to
the
place
where
his
friend
and
the
biplane
were
hidden
no
danger
of
his
seeing
sallie
so
do
mention
it
to
her
wait
i
give
you
my
hand
to
help
you
up
sallie
but
the
country
girl
had
led
the
horse
alongside
the
drinking
trough
and
was
on
his
back
in
a
jiffy
long
before
frank
could
come
across
goodbye
and
good
luck
boys
she
called
back
as
she
gave
the
horse
a
switch
with
the
end
of
the
halter
and
was
off
at
a
lumbering
pace
they
stood
there
a
minute
or
so
watching
the
girl
flying
down
the
lane
she
turned
around
once
and
waved
her
hand
at
them
while
her
long
hair
blew
behind
in
a
cloud
frank
would
not
soon
forget
the
sight
of
sallie
hoskins
going
to
carry
the
news
to
a
point
where
it
could
be
telephoned
in
to
town
news
that
would
cause
a
tremendous
wave
of
excitement
to
pass
over
the
whole
of
bloomsbury
hurrah
that
done
and
well
done
too
frank
i
say
exclaimed
andy
turning
on
his
cousin
with
a
face
that
plainly
said
what
next
on
our
programme
before
we
pull
out
i
guess
we
owe
it
to
the
good
woman
to
tell
her
something
of
the
truth
for
i
do
believe
she
knows
a
single
thing
about
it
from
sallie
or
the
professor
so
come
along
to
the
kitchen
with
me
andy
then
we
chase
off
to
where
we
left
our
aeroplane
and
stand
ready
for
anything
that
may
happen
the
two
of
them
quickly
reached
the
kitchen
door
inside
they
found
hoskins
tired
looking
and
red
of
face
still
busily
engaged
with
her
canning
operations
for
peaches
were
ripe
and
tomatoes
needing
immediate
attention
if
she
hoped
to
lay
away
her
customary
stock
for
the
coming
winter
she
came
to
the
door
where
it
was
cooler
a
look
of
rising
curiosity
on
her
patient
face
and
frank
started
in
to
tell
what
he
thought
necessary
she
was
at
first
much
worried
to
learn
that
she
had
been
innocently
harboring
a
criminal
under
her
humble
roof
but
frank
soon
allayed
her
fears
on
that
account
he
also
told
her
how
sallie
had
consented
to
ride
over
to
a
neighbor
to
send
a
telephone
message
for
him
so
that
the
good
woman
might
not
be
worried
over
her
absence
and
now
having
done
what
he
considered
his
duty
frank
began
to
think
it
might
be
the
part
of
wisdom
for
himself
and
his
cousin
to
consider
their
own
affairs
and
make
for
the
spot
where
their
lay
in
the
field
oh
i
do
hope
they
are
caught
said
the
farmer
wife
just
to
think
of
that
easy
talking
little
man
being
a
desperate
criminal
i
shall
be
afraid
to
stay
all
alone
in
the
house
after
this
listen
frank
somebody
shouting
out
there
what
if
both
of
those
yeggs
are
coming
back
to
get
us
andy
had
clutched
the
sleeve
of
his
cousin
coat
when
saying
this
but
frank
did
not
need
to
be
told
that
something
like
excitement
was
bearing
down
upon
them
oh
it
jerry
my
husband
exclaimed
hoskins
just
then
and
he
seems
to
be
dreadfully
excited
too
listen
to
him
calling
to
me
i
wonder
what
could
have
happened
what
if
he
gone
and
cut
himself
badly
always
digging
and
making
holes
in
the
ground
since
that
silly
old
fortune
teller
said
he
would
find
a
mine
on
the
farm
and
here
he
comes
too
just
then
a
figure
came
staggering
around
the
corner
of
the
house
it
was
the
old
farmer
plainly
tremendously
excited
and
although
weak
and
almost
out
of
breath
from
running
trying
to
tell
her
something
it
there
jennie
found
it
wife
ai
had
all
my
work
for
i
tell
you
a
vein
of
hard
coal
think
enough
to
make
us
all
rich
d
hear
that
jennie
girl
rich
gim
me
a
drink
of
water
for
i
nigh
dead
from
runnin
to
tell
you
the
great
news
who
these
boys
wife
sallie
at
frank
would
have
liked
very
much
to
remain
and
hear
the
particulars
of
the
farmer
good
luck
in
locating
a
vein
of
coal
on
his
property
but
time
would
not
permit
he
only
hoped
hoskins
was
not
mistaken
for
traces
of
coal
had
been
known
to
exist
around
that
neighborhood
for
some
time
though
up
to
now
none
had
been
found
in
paying
quantities
for
mining
purposes
come
on
andy
we
have
to
be
skipping
out
please
tell
your
husband
all
you
know
about
what
happened
hoskins
hope
you
have
struck
it
rich
sir
with
that
frank
hurried
off
andy
trailing
behind
the
farmer
stared
after
them
as
though
hardly
knowing
what
to
make
of
it
all
but
they
could
hear
the
good
woman
begin
to
explain
and
had
no
doubt
she
would
be
able
to
satisfy
his
reasonable
curiosity
for
the
time
being
the
bird
boys
must
forget
all
about
what
lay
in
the
past
because
it
was
the
future
that
should
interest
them
wholly
they
had
reached
a
point
in
the
hunt
where
perhaps
a
sudden
change
of
plans
would
be
necessary
particularly
if
those
they
followed
had
taken
the
alarm
and
were
ready
to
shake
the
dust
of
this
section
of
the
country
from
their
shoes
away
from
the
farmhouse
hurried
the
two
young
aviators
making
as
near
a
bee
line
for
the
field
where
they
had
left
their
aeroplane
as
they
could
possibly
manage
and
all
the
while
searching
the
sky
for
signs
of
the
other
flying
machine
chapter
xviii
an
aeroplane
chase
here
it
is
and
everything
seems
all
right
remarked
andy
as
they
reached
the
field
and
found
the
just
where
they
had
left
it
yes
no
one
has
disturbed
a
thing
which
i
think
is
lucky
for
us
frank
went
on
to
say
as
he
proceeded
to
put
back
the
small
part
he
had
taken
away
with
him
and
thus
place
the
machine
in
perfect
condition
for
business
andy
moved
about
looking
to
see
that
all
obstacles
threatening
to
interfere
with
a
successful
launching
were
removed
from
in
front
of
the
waiting
aeroplane
so
minutes
passed
until
at
least
ten
had
crept
by
since
their
coming
frank
had
everything
tuned
up
and
knew
of
not
the
least
chance
where
he
could
improve
the
conditions
of
planes
or
motor
for
all
seemed
to
be
as
nearly
perfect
as
they
could
be
made
both
boys
cast
frequent
glances
aloft
and
as
a
rule
toward
that
particular
quarter
where
they
presently
expected
to
see
something
moving
they
were
keyed
up
to
a
pretty
lively
pitch
of
excitement
though
frank
did
not
show
it
half
as
much
as
his
younger
cousin
who
was
always
affected
this
way
then
suddenly
andy
called
out
there
she
rises
frank
oh
look
at
them
boring
up
will
you
in
that
corkscrew
spiral
way
tell
me
that
casper
blue
does
know
his
business
perc
will
never
get
as
much
out
of
his
biplane
as
that
old
and
experienced
aviator
means
to
are
we
going
to
follow
suit
frank
get
aboard
came
the
prompt
answer
and
it
was
almost
laughable
to
see
how
nimbly
andy
obeyed
this
order
frank
lost
no
time
in
starting
and
they
went
away
with
a
rush
passing
over
the
abandoned
field
that
was
now
given
up
pretty
much
to
thistles
and
burdocks
with
a
sprinkling
of
it
was
rather
rough
sledding
to
be
sure
and
as
the
bicycle
wheels
pounded
over
the
turf
the
boys
had
to
hold
on
to
keep
their
seats
but
when
sufficient
momentum
had
been
acquired
frank
elevated
the
fore
plane
and
immediately
there
was
the
greatest
relief
felt
for
they
began
to
rise
in
the
air
and
all
that
terrible
bumping
stopped
for
good
the
change
was
wonderful
and
it
felt
as
though
they
were
gliding
on
velvet
we
off
exclaimed
andy
exultantly
frank
said
nothing
he
did
not
possess
quite
the
same
sanguine
nature
that
his
cousin
had
andy
seldom
allowed
thoughts
of
possible
disaster
to
annoy
him
but
on
the
other
hand
frank
was
always
trying
to
head
off
trouble
he
realized
that
with
this
launching
of
their
new
they
would
be
entering
upon
an
extra
hazardous
game
the
outcome
of
which
no
one
could
foresee
the
two
men
whom
they
expected
to
follow
must
be
desperate
fellows
who
would
resort
to
almost
any
hazard
rather
than
allow
themselves
to
be
caught
and
it
was
not
an
amateur
aviator
like
percy
carberry
who
was
opposed
to
them
now
but
one
who
had
had
long
experience
in
the
art
of
harnessing
a
flying
machine
to
do
his
bidding
once
they
left
the
ground
behind
them
frank
started
to
spiral
upward
much
in
the
same
way
the
others
had
done
one
thing
he
was
glad
of
and
this
was
the
presence
of
andy
alongside
casper
blue
might
be
a
daring
air
pilot
but
with
his
companion
a
perfect
greenhorn
in
all
that
pertained
to
the
art
he
would
be
more
or
less
handicapped
a
sudden
incautious
movement
on
the
part
of
the
novice
might
prove
the
undoing
of
the
precious
pair
once
they
had
risen
to
a
certain
height
and
the
aeroplane
was
turned
so
as
to
follow
the
other
air
craft
which
was
speeding
away
headed
directly
into
the
north
of
course
those
aboard
must
know
that
they
were
being
chased
they
could
not
have
failed
to
see
the
hydroplane
as
it
is
generally
called
though
the
true
word
to
cover
it
would
be
even
before
it
left
the
field
once
they
started
to
ascend
well
we
off
at
last
commented
andy
in
a
satisfied
tone
when
the
course
had
been
taken
and
they
were
following
directly
after
the
fugitive
air
craft
and
let
hope
we
come
out
of
this
adventure
as
luckily
as
we
have
on
other
occasions
remarked
sober
frank
wonder
if
perc
happens
to
be
looking
this
way
right
now
andy
went
on
to
say
chances
are
that
he
got
his
old
field
glass
leveled
and
is
searching
the
heavens
right
along
in
hopes
of
locating
his
lost
machine
and
say
if
he
does
glimpse
this
fine
parade
right
now
you
see
him
turning
green
with
envy
to
think
of
another
glorious
chance
coming
to
the
hated
bird
boys
oh
my
oh
me
but
it
would
be
gall
and
wormwood
to
perc
just
as
like
as
not
he
take
a
fit
but
frank
was
not
giving
any
time
to
such
thoughts
as
these
more
serious
affairs
engaged
his
attention
when
once
he
left
the
firm
footing
of
the
solid
earth
and
invaded
the
upper
currents
where
up
to
lately
man
had
never
traveled
save
in
a
drifting
balloon
he
always
put
levity
aside
and
paid
strict
attention
to
business
the
panorama
below
them
was
constantly
changing
and
the
boys
could
not
but
admire
the
pictures
thus
presented
to
their
gaze
no
matter
how
often
one
may
go
up
a
thousand
feet
or
more
above
the
earth
it
is
next
to
impossible
to
weary
of
the
wonderful
scenes
that
keep
passing
constantly
in
review
as
the
buzzing
motor
keeps
carrying
the
aeroplane
along
over
plain
valley
hills
forests
rivers
and
villages
or
towns
that
chance
to
lie
in
the
route
to
andy
it
was
all
somewhat
in
the
nature
of
a
grand
picnic
for
his
nature
was
not
one
to
contemplate
peril
at
a
distance
had
he
and
frank
just
come
out
for
an
hour
spin
he
could
not
have
shown
more
delight
as
they
went
whirling
through
space
with
that
rival
flier
a
mile
or
two
ahead
do
you
think
we
gaining
on
them
asked
andy
after
some
time
had
elapsed
and
the
country
below
began
to
get
unfamiliar
proving
that
they
had
now
come
beyond
the
range
of
any
previous
trip
taken
to
the
northward
of
bloomsbury
i
do
know
for
sure
replied
his
cousin
sometimes
i
think
we
are
and
then
again
i
a
little
in
doubt
suppose
you
get
the
glass
out
and
see
what
they
doing
andy
well
i
a
great
one
forgetting
all
about
that
bully
marine
glass
as
he
said
this
andy
hastened
to
feel
for
the
article
in
question
which
was
always
kept
handy
because
there
never
could
be
any
telling
when
they
might
want
to
use
it
in
a
hurry
go
slow
no
use
rocking
the
boat
sang
out
the
pilot
who
was
forever
cautioning
his
companion
with
regard
to
quick
motions
when
seated
in
such
a
delicately
balanced
contraption
as
a
biplane
it
a
good
thing
that
we
got
that
new
contrivance
that
wright
invented
on
this
machine
right
now
because
only
for
that
you
be
giving
me
more
than
a
few
scares
when
you
swing
from
one
side
to
the
other
so
quickly
a
minute
later
and
andy
who
had
been
looking
through
the
glasses
spoke
again
it
a
little
hard
to
cover
them
steadily
because
they
keep
rising
and
dipping
just
like
we
are
but
i
can
see
that
little
casper
blue
and
the
man
alongside
of
him
is
a
much
larger
chap
of
course
it
casper
who
piloting
the
biplane
remarked
frank
yes
and
he
knows
the
ropes
let
me
tell
you
i
do
believe
there
are
many
professional
birdmen
today
who
can
go
ahead
of
that
man
i
only
wish
you
could
take
a
squint
through
here
and
watch
how
he
manipulates
the
levers
in
spite
of
that
stiff
arm
of
his
only
for
that
and
still
be
in
the
harness
and
doing
stunts
that
have
beachy
left
far
behind
either
that
or
else
he
be
buried
remarked
frank
drily
oh
well
the
less
we
have
to
say
about
that
the
better
i
feel
frank
if
you
going
in
for
aviation
at
all
you
just
got
to
forget
all
about
being
in
constant
danger
though
i
hope
i
never
get
so
be
reckless
like
perc
carberry
but
frank
sure
we
seem
to
be
picking
up
a
little
on
that
crowd
and
from
the
way
they
keep
looking
back
all
the
while
i
guess
they
know
it
too
perhaps
we
are
frank
went
on
to
say
but
if
i
really
thought
so
cut
down
a
peg
or
two
in
our
speed
at
that
andy
set
up
a
howl
at
least
he
voiced
his
objection
well
that
a
queer
stunt
for
you
to
do
i
must
say
frank
here
we
are
chasing
after
our
game
and
the
very
first
time
we
believe
gaining
some
you
inform
me
you
mean
to
cut
down
our
speed
is
that
the
way
to
win
the
game
tell
me
but
we
do
want
to
come
up
with
them
while
we
booming
along
like
this
you
understand
ventured
frank
as
he
gently
moved
a
lever
just
a
trifle
this
sort
of
racing
is
a
lot
different
from
what
you
do
on
the
ground
down
there
suppose
we
did
come
abreast
of
that
biplane
right
now
what
good
would
that
do
us
could
we
put
out
a
hand
and
arrest
the
yeggmen
would
it
be
more
likely
that
such
desperate
men
as
these
must
be
would
try
some
sort
of
game
looking
to
disable
our
craft
and
sending
us
tumbling
down
to
our
death
no
excuse
me
from
coming
to
close
quarters
up
here
with
such
hard
cases
honest
now
andy
if
they
began
to
circle
around
as
if
they
meant
to
turn
on
us
i
think
it
my
duty
to
run
oh
exclaimed
andy
you
mean
you
coax
to
follow
us
back
to
bloomsbury
and
then
give
themselves
up
is
that
it
frank
oh
but
you
a
cunning
chap
sure
you
are
but
on
the
level
now
what
is
our
game
if
it
does
mean
we
going
to
overtake
i
tell
you
andy
we
ought
to
keep
following
after
them
as
far
as
we
can
and
in
that
way
learn
where
they
drop
if
we
get
a
chance
to
send
down
an
occasional
message
to
be
sent
on
to
bloomsbury
so
much
the
better
i
written
several
such
out
and
have
the
cord
to
tie
them
to
weights
given
a
chance
when
we
passing
over
some
town
perhaps
we
can
get
one
such
message
sent
on
home
even
that
would
tell
them
where
we
were
and
what
the
chances
are
great
game
frank
suppose
you
let
me
have
those
messages
and
i
be
amusing
myself
getting
the
same
ready
to
heave
when
you
say
the
word
we
play
that
this
is
a
war
game
and
we
been
sent
out
to
drop
bombs
on
the
fortifications
of
the
enemy
we
done
it
with
rocks
and
we
can
throw
pretty
straight
so
it
seems
to
me
we
ought
to
get
some
sort
of
fun
out
of
it
all
around
frank
told
him
where
he
could
find
the
written
messages
in
his
outer
pocket
and
for
some
time
andy
was
quiet
busying
himself
in
fastening
some
sort
of
anchor
to
each
piece
of
paper
sufficient
to
carry
it
earthward
despite
the
breeze
that
at
the
time
might
be
blowing
all
at
once
andy
noticed
that
they
were
going
quite
slowly
in
comparison
with
the
pace
they
had
lately
been
hitting
up
what
happening
frank
he
exclaimed
almost
alarmed
lest
some
accident
had
befallen
the
reliable
little
motor
which
up
to
now
had
never
failed
them
no
matter
how
great
the
call
upon
its
resources
why
are
we
slowing
up
is
there
something
gone
wrong
and
must
we
own
up
to
being
beaten
look
ahead
at
the
biplane
was
all
that
frank
replied
chapter
xix
dropping
a
bomb
oh
we
started
to
swoop
down
on
them
honest
to
goodness
i
believe
they
more
half
as
far
ahead
as
they
were
frank
cried
andy
thrilled
by
the
sight
of
the
other
biplane
being
so
near
just
about
that
said
frank
quietly
the
busy
motor
having
decreased
its
merry
hum
so
that
they
could
talk
without
raising
their
voices
very
much
then
you
must
have
let
out
an
extra
kink
did
you
frank
when
i
was
busy
with
my
bombs
demanded
the
other
oh
no
came
the
answer
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
andy
they
have
dropped
off
a
lot
of
their
speed
and
that
how
we
covered
space
quicker
something
gone
wrong
with
percy
new
gnome
engine
then
has
it
and
he
blew
his
horn
so
about
what
wonders
it
was
going
to
do
huh
and
andy
chuckled
in
his
boyish
delight
no
i
do
believe
that
is
the
reason
they
slackened
their
speed
andy
trying
to
save
gasolene
then
pursued
the
other
hardly
that
either
andy
oh
now
i
see
what
you
mean
frank
the
poor
old
greenhorn
got
cold
feet
and
is
making
casper
slow
down
he
thinks
that
there
less
chance
of
a
tumble
if
the
speed
is
reduced
just
as
if
that
could
make
any
particular
difference
i
reckon
you
away
off
yet
persisted
frank
then
for
goodness
sake
wo
you
tell
me
what
they
have
cut
notches
out
of
their
speed
for
because
i
all
balled
up
and
blessed
if
i
can
think
of
another
thing
oh
look
at
that
frank
sure
as
anything
i
saw
a
puff
of
smoke
then
there
must
be
something
the
matter
with
their
engine
and
they
getting
scared
i
would
be
surprised
a
mite
to
see
them
settle
right
away
and
try
to
land
well
you
saw
smoke
all
right
and
if
you
listened
sharp
you
have
heard
a
sassy
little
bark
at
the
same
time
andy
a
what
frank
call
it
a
snarl
then
take
up
your
glasses
andy
and
look
while
i
drop
out
even
a
little
more
of
our
speed
so
we
fall
back
further
hardly
had
andy
clapped
the
glasses
to
his
eyes
than
he
gave
vent
to
an
exclamation
of
mingled
amazement
and
alarm
that
greenhorn
is
looking
this
way
frank
and
as
sure
as
goodness
pointing
at
us
right
now
oh
he
did
something
then
for
i
saw
another
puff
of
smoke
and
it
came
right
from
his
hand
why
he
shooting
at
us
frank
that
must
be
a
gun
he
got
in
his
hand
and
he
trying
to
hit
us
if
our
motor
did
keep
up
such
a
constant
whirl
we
might
have
heard
the
whine
of
that
lead
when
it
went
singing
past
us
yes
perhaps
we
might
frank
went
on
to
say
composedly
but
what
can
we
do
demanded
the
other
nervously
nothing
more
than
decrease
our
own
speed
as
often
as
they
do
and
play
the
game
of
tag
backwards
if
they
get
going
it
too
strong
why
just
as
i
said
before
i
turn
tail
and
head
back
toward
bloomsbury
daring
them
to
follow
which
you
can
be
sure
they
wo
because
our
town
is
a
mighty
unhealthy
place
just
now
for
casper
blue
and
his
pal
there
he
fired
again
that
makes
three
times
he
tried
it
frank
and
i
guess
he
can
try
the
other
three
without
doing
us
any
damage
andy
you
believe
that
do
you
asked
the
one
spoken
to
sure
thing
frank
replied
positively
why
it
would
be
one
chance
in
ten
thousand
that
he
could
strike
any
part
of
our
aeroplane
at
that
distance
going
as
both
of
us
are
and
with
only
a
revolver
i
be
willing
to
let
him
blaze
away
all
day
without
being
a
bit
afraid
but
i
bound
that
the
two
air
crafts
must
keep
at
least
this
distance
apart
the
man
in
the
other
airship
did
fire
three
more
times
but
without
any
success
whatever
and
as
though
the
rival
navigator
realized
that
frank
tactics
would
effectually
prevent
his
coming
into
closer
contact
with
the
pursuing
craft
he
no
longer
tried
to
close
in
but
increasing
his
speed
was
quickly
about
the
old
distance
away
whereupon
frank
bird
also
hit
up
the
pace
cautiously
that
the
ticket
cried
out
andy
presently
i
guess
we
holding
our
own
again
now
for
a
little
while
i
began
to
be
afraid
that
they
were
going
to
just
make
us
take
their
dust
and
give
us
the
merry
vanishing
in
the
distance
but
now
i
know
you
got
the
twist
of
the
thing
down
fine
frank
and
can
haul
up
on
the
biplane
or
drop
back
just
as
you
feel
like
for
a
long
time
they
kept
on
neither
saying
anything
for
talking
is
always
more
or
less
of
an
effort
when
speeding
along
in
an
aeroplane
with
the
wind
striking
one
in
the
face
frank
had
had
no
time
to
fully
adjust
the
muffler
which
he
usually
wore
about
his
neck
when
about
to
soar
to
a
dizzy
height
so
he
would
have
to
do
the
best
he
could
and
besides
there
was
little
chance
of
the
other
aeroplane
venturing
to
bore
upward
to
any
unusual
degree
all
the
efforts
of
the
bank
thieves
being
directed
toward
making
their
escape
he
did
have
his
goggles
adjusted
however
which
was
a
good
thing
since
his
eyes
must
have
watered
very
much
from
the
cold
air
and
this
is
considered
an
ever
present
source
of
danger
to
one
who
manipulates
the
levers
of
a
aeroplane
we
seem
to
have
dropped
a
good
deal
lower
frank
remarked
andy
after
another
space
of
time
had
elapsed
yes
remarked
the
pilot
tersely
and
i
looking
now
for
a
good
chance
to
make
use
of
one
of
my
bombs
do
you
think
it
about
time
to
try
the
scheme
out
andy
continued
just
as
you
feel
like
replied
frank
then
at
the
very
next
town
or
place
that
looks
like
it
had
telephone
connection
with
the
outside
world
i
going
to
have
a
try
might
have
done
it
when
we
passed
over
that
last
place
where
the
people
were
all
waving
things
up
at
us
and
we
could
just
hear
a
confused
shouting
i
bet
you
frank
they
just
thought
this
was
a
regular
air
contest
with
a
prize
offered
to
the
winner
well
it
is
observed
the
other
if
we
win
we
take
back
our
prisoners
and
on
the
other
hand
if
they
come
out
first
best
they
get
away
to
canada
with
their
liberty
and
their
plunder
yes
it
a
race
all
right
andy
a
test
of
skill
and
endurance
and
perhaps
the
best
man
will
win
then
i
know
who
that
will
be
declared
andy
enthusiastically
do
be
too
sure
warned
frank
though
it
must
have
pleased
him
to
know
that
he
possessed
the
fullest
confidence
of
his
cousin
and
chum
who
had
been
his
constant
companion
on
so
many
expeditions
and
must
understand
him
like
a
book
what
if
they
keep
everlastingly
at
it
and
night
comes
on
asked
andy
presently
well
there
the
moon
though
i
do
like
chasing
along
this
way
after
sundown
and
if
we
put
to
it
we
got
our
fine
you
must
remember
frank
replied
there
i
believe
we
going
to
pass
right
over
another
town
frank
it
does
look
that
way
for
a
fact
admitted
the
other
casper
see
any
reason
why
he
should
bother
changing
his
set
course
due
north
because
he
happens
to
pass
a
few
towns
away
up
here
in
the
northern
end
of
the
state
let
the
people
stare
all
they
want
to
he
been
used
to
having
crowds
gape
at
him
you
know
and
rather
likes
it
besides
if
he
gets
away
what
does
it
matter
andy
prepared
himself
for
the
little
job
he
had
on
hand
as
he
had
practiced
throwing
stones
from
the
aeroplane
while
at
a
great
height
just
to
see
how
near
he
could
come
to
hitting
a
certain
place
far
below
so
as
to
ascertain
what
chance
aviators
would
have
of
making
bombs
tell
in
war
times
the
boy
believed
he
would
be
able
to
drop
his
message
pretty
accurately
in
some
open
place
close
to
where
the
townspeople
were
clustered
and
seeing
it
fall
some
one
would
be
sure
to
hurry
over
to
secure
the
mysterious
object
here
goes
our
old
broken
wrench
which
has
been
hanging
around
so
long
declared
andy
as
leaning
carefully
over
he
measured
distances
with
his
eye
and
suddenly
let
the
object
slip
taking
care
to
make
all
allowances
for
their
speed
this
is
more
of
a
trick
than
most
boys
would
suppose
the
next
time
you
are
on
a
speeding
electric
car
throw
a
stone
at
a
telegraph
pole
just
as
you
are
passing
it
and
see
how
much
beyond
the
missile
will
alight
because
of
the
momentum
it
received
because
of
the
fact
of
its
starting
from
the
moving
car
andy
had
this
pretty
well
figured
out
and
knew
just
when
to
launch
his
weighted
message
he
turned
his
head
and
tried
to
follow
it
downward
as
well
as
he
was
able
because
of
the
fluttering
white
paper
it
going
straight
there
frank
i
do
believe
he
exclaimed
as
he
managed
to
get
the
powerful
glasses
up
to
his
eyes
and
fairly
followed
the
progress
of
the
message
though
quickly
losing
it
again
yes
and
the
crowd
there
on
the
green
must
see
it
coming
because
already
a
bunch
of
boys
has
started
to
jump
that
way
they
find
it
easy
enough
frank
now
what
d
think
of
that
for
a
successful
bomb
throw
good
enough
for
you
andy
was
the
hearty
response
and
we
have
to
take
it
as
a
sign
that
we
going
to
come
out
of
this
scrape
as
we
generally
do
with
our
colors
flying
frank
usually
allowed
himself
to
feel
the
fullest
belief
in
his
own
abilities
at
the
same
time
he
always
wished
to
avoid
again
time
passed
on
and
the
hum
of
the
busy
motor
was
the
only
sound
that
came
to
the
ears
of
the
two
young
aviators
they
were
again
making
nearly
full
speed
though
andy
felt
pretty
confident
that
had
it
been
necessary
for
frank
to
coax
an
additional
unit
or
two
of
hurry
from
the
gallant
little
kinkaid
engine
it
would
respond
to
his
efforts
my
but
we
must
have
covered
a
lot
of
distance
since
we
started
was
the
next
remark
from
andy
how
long
do
you
suppose
we
been
going
frank
look
and
see
it
was
just
five
minutes
after
one
when
we
left
the
field
on
the
hoskins
farm
andy
two
hours
frank
now
what
d
think
of
that
why
i
never
would
have
believed
it
if
you
told
me
do
you
think
my
watch
has
jumped
on
ahead
no
because
we
been
hustling
right
along
all
of
that
time
i
guess
andy
keeping
everlastingly
at
it
and
headed
due
north
all
the
while
said
andy
as
straight
as
a
die
they
never
varied
their
course
even
a
little
bit
as
far
as
i
could
see
the
pilot
declared
but
we
covered
an
awful
lot
of
apace
frank
i
guess
you
right
there
admitted
the
one
addressed
and
frank
if
we
keep
on
this
way
and
nothing
happens
we
ought
to
sight
the
big
lake
away
ahead
there
inside
of
an
hour
more
i
should
think
andy
ventured
to
say
and
he
was
thrilled
when
his
companion
turning
toward
him
just
at
that
moment
went
on
to
say
perhaps
in
less
time
than
that
andy
with
the
glasses
you
might
glimpse
it
even
now
chapter
xx
over
land
and
sea
are
you
joshing
me
frank
demanded
the
other
bird
boy
as
he
swung
eagerly
around
so
as
to
fix
his
glasses
upon
the
far
off
horizon
ahead
of
them
i
certainly
am
not
andy
but
please
be
more
careful
how
you
move
you
gave
me
a
punch
in
the
ribs
just
then
that
sent
a
cold
shiver
all
over
me
do
forget
that
we
not
stretched
out
on
the
ground
under
an
apple
tree
taking
an
afternoon
doze
well
what
do
you
see
frank
i
do
believe
you
right
about
that
lake
business
exclaimed
andy
then
you
can
see
it
asked
the
other
himself
more
than
anxious
because
of
the
fact
that
the
fleeing
bank
robbers
who
had
stolen
the
biplane
of
percy
carberry
apparently
intended
to
escape
over
the
line
into
canada
even
if
to
accomplish
their
purpose
they
had
to
daringly
cross
lake
ontario
many
miles
wide
a
feat
as
yet
only
successfully
done
by
one
or
two
bold
fliers
of
national
repute
i
sure
can
and
the
way
we
heading
it
a
dead
thing
that
we
just
going
to
swing
out
over
the
water
before
another
hour
passes
whew
andy
finished
his
sentence
with
this
significant
exclamation
it
was
as
though
not
only
the
novelty
of
the
thing
but
its
thrilling
nature
staggered
him
the
bird
boys
had
flown
under
many
strange
conditions
but
as
yet
they
had
not
made
a
water
flight
there
is
and
always
must
be
a
vast
difference
between
passing
over
the
land
with
its
forests
hills
valleys
plains
cities
and
villages
to
starting
out
over
a
wide
stretch
of
inland
sea
with
only
the
tumbling
waves
far
below
and
new
as
well
as
untried
currents
of
air
to
meet
and
conquer
more
than
a
few
times
andy
bird
had
expressed
a
wish
to
have
just
such
an
experience
it
would
be
a
novelty
something
entirely
new
in
their
line
and
which
would
give
them
possibly
delightful
thrills
but
now
that
the
chance
seemed
opening
up
before
them
he
found
himself
viewing
it
with
considerable
apprehension
as
well
as
delight
of
course
it
made
considerable
difference
that
they
should
be
chasing
after
a
desperate
pair
of
rascals
rather
than
simply
trying
to
accomplish
a
flight
from
united
states
territory
to
that
belonging
to
canada
there
was
always
the
chance
that
these
men
might
turn
upon
them
and
succeed
in
doing
something
to
injure
the
hydroplane
causing
it
to
drop
into
the
midst
of
that
inland
sea
strange
how
small
things
often
insist
upon
thrusting
themselves
forward
when
some
sort
of
peril
threatens
the
very
first
thing
andy
seemed
to
think
about
was
the
fact
that
they
did
not
happen
to
have
any
life
preservers
aboard
the
craft
not
that
there
was
one
chance
in
a
thousand
they
would
ever
need
such
things
around
bloomsbury
though
there
was
lake
sunrise
to
be
reckoned
with
but
just
then
it
struck
the
boy
that
every
well
equipped
aeroplane
ought
always
to
carry
a
couple
of
rubber
rings
along
which
in
moments
of
dire
necessity
could
be
blown
full
of
air
and
would
serve
to
sustain
wrecked
aviators
until
help
came
he
even
decided
to
mention
this
fact
to
his
cousin
after
this
voyage
was
concluded
it
loomed
up
as
large
as
the
rock
of
gibralter
just
then
even
as
a
dream
may
at
the
moment
of
awaking
but
which
later
on
begins
to
lose
its
realistic
effect
until
it
seems
next
door
to
silly
they
do
show
the
least
sign
of
changing
their
course
do
they
frank
andy
remarked
after
another
spell
of
time
had
passed
not
that
you
could
notice
replied
the
other
composedly
andy
derived
more
or
less
comfort
from
this
way
his
chum
had
of
keeping
his
head
even
under
the
most
trying
conditions
when
his
own
nerves
were
fairly
quivering
with
excitement
it
always
steadied
andy
to
turn
and
see
that
frank
was
as
cool
and
calm
as
though
nothing
were
amiss
more
than
a
few
times
in
the
past
it
had
caused
the
more
bird
boy
to
conquer
his
own
weakness
and
do
himself
credit
in
some
difficult
feat
that
became
necessary
example
is
a
splendid
thing
to
lead
any
boy
along
safe
roads
words
may
be
forgotten
in
the
trying
moment
but
when
he
actually
sees
the
thing
done
before
his
very
eyes
it
is
indelibly
impressed
upon
his
mind
about
how
long
will
it
be
before
we
get
there
andy
asked
again
for
he
was
forever
wanting
to
know
when
he
had
any
misgivings
about
his
own
capacity
for
reaching
a
reasonable
conclusion
do
you
mean
before
we
leave
the
land
and
commence
our
voyage
across
the
lake
frank
inquired
yes
that
it
more
than
half
an
hour
at
the
speed
we
going
now
continued
the
other
just
about
i
should
say
frank
replied
after
carefully
measuring
distances
with
his
eye
we
are
up
pretty
high
and
can
cover
a
tremendous
range
you
know
so
we
first
glimpsed
the
lake
when
we
were
a
long
ways
off
it
may
be
all
of
forty
miles
away
right
now
and
as
we
must
be
clipping
along
at
the
rate
of
eighty
with
the
breeze
favorable
behind
us
why
half
an
hour
ought
to
see
us
there
andy
fell
silent
again
many
times
did
his
eyes
travel
from
the
distant
water
to
the
earth
below
them
and
then
follow
this
up
with
an
uneasy
stare
at
the
other
aeroplane
that
was
flying
along
far
ahead
of
them
the
whole
solution
of
the
problem
of
course
lay
in
the
hands
of
the
man
who
controlled
the
destinies
of
that
stolen
biplane
would
he
really
have
the
nerve
to
attempt
a
flight
across
that
great
body
of
fresh
water
aiming
to
land
on
foreign
shores
from
which
he
could
not
easily
be
extradited
frank
seemed
to
think
that
such
was
undoubtedly
the
intention
of
casper
blue
the
little
man
who
had
been
actor
aviator
and
yeggman
in
turn
during
the
course
of
his
adventurous
life
he
had
already
proven
beyond
any
doubt
that
he
was
a
capable
airman
even
though
he
did
have
a
crippled
arm
never
had
the
bird
boys
seen
an
aeroplane
handled
with
more
extraordinary
skill
and
dash
than
was
the
one
that
had
been
stolen
from
the
hangar
of
percy
carberry
no
unless
something
unexpected
happened
to
disturb
the
plans
of
the
fugitive
yeggmen
inside
the
next
half
hour
they
plainly
meant
to
launch
out
on
a
voyage
across
the
lake
possibly
thousands
of
feet
above
its
surface
and
perhaps
among
the
very
clouds
not
once
did
andy
dream
of
asking
his
cousin
whether
in
this
event
he
considered
it
the
part
of
wisdom
for
them
to
follow
the
men
who
were
doubly
risking
their
lives
in
this
mad
effort
to
escape
with
their
booty
he
knew
frank
only
too
well
to
doubt
his
willingness
to
undertake
such
a
trip
as
this
in
times
gone
by
and
especially
when
they
were
down
in
south
america
with
their
aeroplane
seeking
professor
bird
who
had
been
lost
with
the
balloon
in
which
he
was
conducting
experiments
on
the
isthmus
they
had
bravely
faced
just
as
serious
perils
as
this
promised
to
be
yes
and
wrenched
victory
from
the
jaws
of
apparent
defeat
more
than
once
hence
it
was
a
foregone
conclusion
that
if
casper
blue
attempted
the
difficult
feat
of
flying
across
the
lake
after
being
in
the
air
several
long
hours
the
two
bird
boys
were
determined
to
keep
following
after
him
it
seemed
like
a
game
of
conquer
which
andy
remembered
so
well
where
the
rival
aviator
dared
to
go
they
must
follow
or
acknowledge
his
superiority
as
a
bold
airman
something
neither
of
them
felt
like
doing
frank
had
figured
it
all
out
while
he
was
speeding
along
so
smoothly
so
far
as
he
could
see
everything
was
working
as
easily
as
could
be
the
motor
never
missed
and
was
running
like
a
charm
just
as
though
it
could
keep
this
up
everlastingly
in
an
endurance
test
and
besides
the
wind
what
there
was
of
it
at
present
seemed
to
favor
them
most
positively
because
it
was
at
their
backs
so
far
as
appearances
went
the
conditions
were
ideal
for
the
crossing
of
the
great
lake
that
was
now
showing
up
ahead
most
grandly
andy
drew
in
big
breaths
and
tried
to
keep
from
quivering
with
delight
mingled
with
just
a
little
nervousness
here
was
a
new
experience
about
to
come
to
them
and
one
that
they
were
not
apt
to
soon
forget
as
a
boy
andy
delighted
in
novel
sensations
and
as
an
ambitious
aviator
he
yearned
to
experience
all
the
glorious
possibilities
that
open
up
to
the
one
who
has
the
pluck
and
the
nerve
to
attempt
them
they
could
see
a
town
in
plain
sight
though
they
had
gradually
ascended
since
andy
cast
his
bomb
so
successfully
perhaps
his
little
game
of
opening
communications
with
the
earth
below
had
been
observed
by
one
of
those
in
the
leading
airship
and
in
order
to
prevent
another
attempt
this
gradual
ascent
had
been
immediately
carried
out
but
frank
fully
expected
to
see
the
rival
aeroplane
begin
to
drop
as
they
drew
near
the
border
of
the
fresh
water
sea
since
just
then
there
was
no
squally
wind
near
the
surface
of
the
water
which
they
wished
to
avoid
by
remaining
thousands
of
feet
high
the
chances
were
that
casper
blue
would
soon
commence
to
use
his
deflecting
rudder
and
begin
to
descend
in
wide
spirals
or
else
with
the
daring
of
an
old
and
skilled
air
navigator
shut
off
power
and
volplane
down
in
a
slant
that
would
thrill
any
spectator
as
nothing
else
could
until
the
required
distance
had
been
covered
when
he
would
again
bring
the
shooting
aeroplane
on
a
level
basis
and
resume
his
forward
progress
whatever
he
did
frank
was
ready
to
imitate
he
had
the
fullest
confidence
in
his
own
ability
to
accomplish
the
most
difficult
feat
that
would
be
required
steady
yourself
now
andy
he
cautioned
because
they
going
to
change
the
going
pretty
soon
i
take
it
better
put
that
glass
away
and
be
ready
to
give
me
a
lift
if
i
need
it
watch
and
see
if
they
drop
down
closer
to
the
water
it
would
be
a
wise
thing
to
do
i
take
it
for
in
case
of
accident
the
spill
would
be
so
bad
all
right
frank
just
as
you
say
replied
the
other
accustomed
to
looking
to
his
cousin
for
the
words
of
command
when
an
emergency
or
a
crisis
came
along
he
fastened
the
precious
glasses
in
their
rigid
case
where
they
would
be
safe
so
long
as
the
aeroplane
remained
above
the
surface
of
the
water
or
did
not
fall
to
the
ground
in
a
serious
wreck
then
andy
paid
attention
to
a
number
of
small
but
very
important
matters
that
had
always
been
given
over
into
his
charge
at
times
like
this
the
bird
boys
had
been
comrades
so
long
that
they
worked
together
like
a
well
oiled
machine
the
ball
team
that
has
played
in
company
for
a
season
can
accomplish
feats
that
would
be
utterly
impossible
to
a
nine
that
had
been
brought
from
various
clubs
even
though
each
player
might
have
been
a
star
in
his
respective
team
so
it
was
with
frank
and
andy
they
had
grown
to
know
each
points
so
well
that
when
the
moment
came
it
often
seemed
as
though
they
instinctively
formed
a
single
unit
with
that
exceedingly
bright
brain
possessed
by
frank
doing
all
the
piloting
of
the
combination
they
were
all
ready
for
the
business
in
hand
long
before
the
border
of
the
big
water
was
reached
frank
had
looked
around
him
several
times
and
his
cousin
seemed
to
know
instinctively
that
he
was
endeavoring
to
decide
as
to
whether
the
wind
was
apt
to
hold
as
it
chanced
to
be
at
the
time
or
increase
in
velocity
should
they
drop
to
lower
levels
it
was
rather
awe
inspiring
to
see
that
vast
gulf
of
glistening
water
stretching
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
in
three
directions
north
east
and
west
from
the
high
altitude
which
they
still
occupied
they
could
not
tell
whether
the
lake
was
calm
or
waves
rolling
along
its
surface
the
westering
sun
glittered
from
its
bosom
as
though
it
might
be
streaked
with
gold
and
altogether
it
was
a
sight
that
neither
of
the
boys
would
soon
forget
to
andy
in
particular
it
appealed
with
vigor
his
nature
was
more
inclined
to
worship
at
the
shrine
of
the
romantic
than
would
be
the
case
with
the
practical
frank
to
andy
that
vast
sheet
of
water
seemed
mysterious
profound
filled
with
secrets
of
argosies
that
were
launched
on
its
breast
centuries
ago
when
only
the
bark
canoes
of
the
red
men
had
ever
been
wedded
to
its
waters
in
imagination
the
boy
could
even
then
see
the
barques
of
the
early
explorers
those
bold
men
who
had
pushed
thither
from
across
the
ocean
and
risked
their
lives
in
order
to
learn
what
the
new
country
held
for
brave
hearts
perhaps
had
he
still
gripped
the
glass
in
his
hands
and
cared
to
look
earthward
before
leaving
the
shore
for
that
adventurous
cruise
andy
might
have
seen
many
a
group
of
wondering
people
all
watching
the
flight
of
those
hurrying
ships
of
the
upper
air
currents
and
even
waving
hats
and
handkerchiefs
in
the
endeavor
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
bold
navigators
whom
they
supposed
to
be
engaged
in
a
race
for
a
wager
but
there
was
now
no
longer
time
for
anything
like
this
and
all
their
attention
must
be
concentrated
upon
the
one
thing
that
meant
so
much
to
them
the
safety
of
the
delicate
craft
in
which
they
were
now
about
to
entrust
their
very
lives
for
a
voyage
the
like
of
which
few
airmen
had
ever
entered
before
already
had
the
other
aeroplane
sailed
away
and
was
even
now
hanging
over
the
inland
sea
that
lay
fully
four
thousand
feet
below
its
further
shore
hidden
in
what
seemed
to
be
a
cloud
though
it
might
prove
to
be
a
rising
fog
fated
to
engulf
both
pursuing
and
pursued
air
craft
in
its
baffling
folds
and
turn
the
comedy
of
the
race
into
a
tragedy
goodbye
old
land
sang
out
andy
when
they
seemed
to
suddenly
pass
out
over
the
water
leaving
the
shore
of
new
york
behind
frank
said
not
a
word
but
no
doubt
his
feelings
were
just
as
strong
as
those
of
his
companion
and
so
they
had
now
embarked
on
what
seemed
to
be
the
last
leg
of
the
strange
chase
with
the
future
lying
before
them
as
mystifying
as
that
fog
bank
lying
far
away
to
the
north
chapter
xxi
over
the
boundary
line
it
was
with
the
queerest
possible
feeling
that
andy
saw
the
land
slipping
away
and
realized
that
they
were
at
last
launched
upon
the
water
part
of
the
voyage
it
seemed
as
though
they
had
cast
loose
from
their
safe
moorings
and
were
adrift
upon
an
uncharted
sea
when
comparing
his
feelings
with
other
aviators
in
later
times
he
learned
that
every
one
of
them
had
experienced
exactly
similar
sensations
the
first
time
they
passed
out
of
touch
of
land
and
found
the
heaving
sea
alone
beneath
them
it
was
a
sort
of
air
intoxication
andy
even
called
it
though
doubtless
most
of
it
came
from
imagination
alone
there
they
go
frank
he
called
out
not
ten
minutes
later
the
land
was
far
behind
them
now
and
still
in
the
other
three
directions
they
saw
only
the
level
surface
of
the
great
lake
his
exclamation
was
called
out
by
a
sudden
change
in
the
method
of
advance
adopted
by
those
in
the
leading
aeroplane
instead
of
keeping
along
in
a
direct
line
the
biplane
had
uptilted
and
was
now
shooting
downward
in
what
seemed
a
terribly
perilous
way
just
as
though
the
pair
of
precious
scoundrels
had
taken
a
notion
to
end
the
pursuit
by
seeking
a
plunge
into
the
water
but
both
boys
knew
differently
and
that
this
was
only
a
volplane
adopted
by
experienced
and
rash
aviators
as
a
means
of
reaching
the
lower
air
currents
more
rapidly
than
by
slow
spirals
or
else
undertaken
when
having
engine
trouble
that
threatens
destruction
frank
was
ready
to
follow
suit
it
would
not
be
the
first
time
by
long
odds
that
the
bird
boys
had
accomplished
this
speedy
method
of
descending
from
high
altitudes
there
was
always
an
exhilaration
about
the
clever
trick
that
appealed
irresistibly
to
their
natures
though
frank
would
never
have
attempted
it
unless
reasonably
sure
that
the
conditions
were
favorable
for
success
hold
fast
andy
he
remarked
quietly
the
hum
of
the
motor
suddenly
ceased
and
with
its
cessation
the
hydroplane
was
turned
toward
the
surface
of
the
lake
four
thousand
feet
below
down
they
went
plunging
toward
what
seemed
to
be
instant
destruction
but
a
steady
hand
was
at
the
wheel
and
the
pilot
knew
just
what
was
necessary
to
do
at
the
proper
instant
in
order
to
bring
this
rapid
descent
to
a
stop
and
right
the
airship
on
a
level
keel
but
there
was
no
time
just
then
to
note
what
the
rival
aeroplane
might
be
doing
whether
the
experienced
airman
in
charge
managed
to
stop
that
downward
plunge
before
reaching
the
surface
of
the
lake
or
failing
went
to
his
death
was
a
matter
that
did
not
concern
them
now
since
they
had
their
own
affairs
to
look
after
to
tell
the
truth
andy
heart
seemed
to
be
in
his
throat
as
they
made
the
drop
as
yet
they
had
never
tried
out
the
new
hydroplane
in
a
trick
of
this
sort
and
hence
really
did
not
know
just
how
it
might
act
though
frank
must
have
been
pretty
confident
else
he
would
never
have
attempted
it
given
the
choice
the
bird
boys
would
easily
have
decided
to
descend
from
their
lofty
height
by
means
of
the
much
safer
if
slower
spirals
each
circle
seeing
the
aeroplane
lower
than
before
but
since
the
reckless
man
in
the
other
air
craft
led
the
way
frank
had
chosen
to
follow
he
believed
that
he
could
accomplish
any
feat
that
was
possible
to
casper
blue
especially
now
that
the
old
air
navigator
had
a
handicap
in
the
way
of
a
crippled
arm
the
water
seemed
rushing
up
to
meet
them
so
it
looked
to
andy
whose
anxious
gaze
was
fastened
upon
the
lower
depths
as
they
dipped
down
in
that
terrific
swoop
but
then
he
had
seen
the
same
thing
when
over
the
land
so
that
in
itself
this
did
not
daunt
him
oh
that
exclamation
seemed
to
be
forced
from
andy
lips
when
he
felt
frank
give
a
quick
turn
to
the
lever
that
caused
the
deflecting
rudder
to
again
resume
a
normal
position
the
drop
of
the
aeroplane
was
brought
to
a
gradual
stop
and
when
immediately
afterwards
the
buzz
of
the
motor
announced
that
the
propelling
power
was
again
at
work
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
nervous
boy
expressed
his
relief
by
giving
vent
to
that
cry
there
was
a
world
of
gratitude
back
of
that
word
it
can
be
set
down
as
certain
for
no
matter
how
confident
andy
might
have
been
concerning
his
cousin
ability
to
accomplish
wonders
the
new
hydroplane
was
as
yet
untried
in
many
things
now
he
even
dared
take
his
awed
gaze
from
the
heaving
waters
beneath
the
framework
of
the
aeroplane
and
give
a
thought
to
those
whom
they
had
chased
overland
and
water
for
nearly
three
hours
bully
for
casper
blue
he
made
the
riffle
too
he
all
to
the
good
was
the
way
the
impulsive
andy
announced
his
discovery
to
frank
who
just
then
could
not
spare
even
a
second
to
take
his
attention
off
the
working
of
the
motor
after
all
it
was
not
so
very
strange
that
the
boy
should
express
himself
in
this
way
true
the
man
he
was
praising
was
now
a
criminal
and
they
sought
to
effect
his
arrest
in
some
manner
as
yet
vague
and
uncertain
but
it
was
not
in
this
light
andy
viewed
him
just
then
as
a
birdsman
casper
blue
had
proved
that
he
still
possessed
the
nerve
and
skill
to
direct
a
daring
flight
and
that
all
the
tricks
known
to
celebrated
fliers
were
at
his
finger
ends
any
one
who
has
risked
his
life
up
among
the
clouds
must
always
respect
such
a
valiant
spirit
even
though
aware
that
the
object
of
his
admiration
has
in
other
ways
forfeited
the
esteem
of
all
honorable
men
there
was
the
biplane
moving
along
on
a
level
keel
and
not
more
than
two
hundred
feet
above
the
water
and
still
the
course
held
due
north
showing
that
the
desperate
men
who
were
thus
fleeing
from
arrest
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
changing
their
plans
what
do
you
think
of
her
now
andy
asked
the
pilot
with
a
quiver
of
pride
in
his
voice
you
must
mean
our
new
craft
i
take
it
frank
and
i
want
to
say
that
she
a
real
peach
if
ever
there
was
one
we
never
volplaned
as
easy
as
that
in
our
lives
and
that
a
fact
why
it
was
like
sliding
downhill
on
a
sled
with
never
a
single
bump
on
the
way
i
could
do
that
all
day
and
never
get
enough
dangerous
business
all
the
same
remarked
frank
and
doubly
so
when
you
do
happen
to
be
well
acquainted
with
your
machine
a
single
hitch
and
we
would
have
struck
the
water
at
a
terrible
rate
but
all
the
same
we
did
frank
the
other
went
on
jubilantly
for
now
that
this
peril
was
of
the
past
andy
could
be
his
old
self
again
and
they
did
just
as
well
remarked
frank
always
ready
to
give
credit
even
though
it
might
be
to
a
rival
for
his
nature
was
generous
to
a
fault
well
that
biplane
was
easier
to
manage
than
our
hydroplane
with
the
pontoons
underneath
andy
went
on
to
say
grudgingly
for
no
one
could
ever
convince
him
that
frank
had
his
superior
as
an
air
pilot
and
he
would
sooner
go
up
to
a
record
height
of
fifteen
thousand
feet
in
company
with
his
cousin
than
accompany
the
most
famous
man
living
it
looks
like
we
might
be
booked
for
canada
frank
he
went
on
to
say
a
minute
later
after
they
had
fallen
into
the
new
stride
comfortably
and
were
rushing
forward
on
a
level
stretch
with
the
surface
of
the
lake
close
at
hand
i
should
wonder
came
the
noncommital
reply
now
andy
knew
his
cousin
like
a
book
perhaps
it
was
something
in
the
words
or
on
the
other
hand
there
may
have
been
an
undercurrent
of
doubt
in
the
way
frank
spoke
that
aroused
the
other
suspicion
what
is
it
frank
he
demanded
for
i
reckon
you
see
something
that
is
all
a
blank
to
me
take
me
in
wo
you
oh
i
was
wondering
what
would
happen
if
they
had
an
accident
away
out
on
the
lake
that
all
admitted
the
other
well
in
that
event
i
guess
it
be
up
to
the
bird
boys
to
play
the
rescuer
act
for
all
it
was
worth
but
frank
do
you
think
this
new
machine
of
ours
could
climb
up
off
the
water
with
four
aboard
that
be
the
limit
to
tell
you
the
truth
andy
i
do
know
because
we
never
had
the
chance
to
try
it
out
with
only
two
of
us
aboard
you
know
how
easy
she
climbed
three
passengers
she
could
hoist
but
four
might
faze
her
we
can
only
wait
and
see
if
ever
the
chance
comes
to
make
the
test
but
you
would
hesitate
about
trying
the
same
i
know
frank
of
course
not
the
other
remarked
confidently
and
especially
when
it
might
mean
life
or
death
to
a
poor
fellow
away
out
here
on
the
lake
miles
from
land
if
we
could
rise
we
might
still
be
able
to
float
like
a
duck
and
hope
that
some
boat
would
come
to
the
rescue
in
the
end
that
would
be
just
the
same
do
you
know
said
andy
i
saw
a
tug
pulling
out
at
full
speed
from
the
little
city
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
close
to
where
we
left
land
and
somehow
i
seem
to
have
an
idea
they
know
all
about
us
and
mean
to
keep
in
touch
with
us
as
long
as
they
can
to
be
handy
in
case
of
accident
perhaps
now
my
message
was
phoned
to
bloomsbury
and
seeing
about
where
we
must
be
heading
if
we
kept
on
a
northerly
course
they
have
wired
up
here
to
watch
out
for
us
how
about
that
frank
am
i
silly
to
figure
that
way
i
do
see
why
you
should
be
andy
in
fact
just
as
soon
as
you
mentioned
about
the
tug
i
began
wondering
if
somehow
these
good
people
did
know
who
we
were
and
what
we
were
chasing
after
the
biplane
for
they
had
to
speak
unusually
loud
in
order
to
hear
even
though
their
heads
were
close
together
at
the
time
for
the
propellers
were
whirling
with
a
hiss
and
the
hum
of
the
motor
added
to
the
noise
but
then
it
was
all
a
merry
racket
that
chimed
in
well
with
the
spirit
of
the
young
aviators
and
which
gave
them
much
the
same
pleasure
that
the
splash
through
the
foaming
water
of
a
racing
yacht
must
awaken
in
the
heart
of
an
enthusiastic
skipper
when
he
knows
that
every
sail
is
drawing
to
the
limit
and
all
things
are
working
well
have
you
figured
out
what
we
ought
to
do
if
by
good
luck
we
all
get
over
to
the
other
side
safe
and
sound
went
on
andy
we
have
to
leave
that
was
the
reply
frank
made
no
use
crossing
a
bridge
till
you
come
to
it
you
know
andy
but
they
be
safe
then
frank
i
afraid
so
even
if
i
pretend
to
be
up
in
all
the
international
law
connected
with
the
passing
of
a
thief
from
united
states
territory
to
canada
but
ai
that
a
measly
shame
ejaculated
the
indignant
andy
to
think
of
a
robber
being
able
to
turn
and
put
his
fingers
to
his
nose
and
wiggle
at
us
just
because
he
happens
to
cross
the
boundary
line
it
ought
to
be
that
way
frank
of
course
not
and
i
guess
lots
of
abler
chaps
than
you
and
me
have
thought
the
same
but
there
it
stands
and
the
two
countries
wo
get
together
to
change
the
law
even
a
little
bit
every
year
dozens
of
embezzlers
light
out
across
the
border
for
canada
where
they
can
spend
their
money
and
start
for
europe
if
they
feel
like
it
then
perhaps
it
the
money
they
take
with
that
the
canadians
like
though
i
would
like
to
believe
such
a
thing
ventured
andy
hardly
that
but
both
countries
are
jealous
about
bringing
back
political
offenders
i
heard
judge
lawson
say
more
than
once
but
do
let
talk
any
more
we
can
help
andy
we
got
our
hands
full
as
it
is
watching
those
fellows
and
keeping
ready
to
match
any
trick
they
try
this
served
to
give
andy
a
new
cause
for
concentrating
his
attention
on
the
fleeing
biplane
once
more
as
yet
the
pilot
of
the
leading
airship
had
not
diverted
from
his
set
course
but
if
he
was
as
tricky
as
they
had
reason
to
believe
there
was
always
a
chance
that
he
might
engineer
some
scheme
sooner
or
later
looking
to
shaking
off
his
pursuers
here
in
the
middle
of
the
great
lake
where
possibly
no
mortal
eye
could
witness
the
deed
so
as
to
appear
against
him
later
on
with
the
wind
aft
of
course
the
further
they
advanced
the
larger
grew
the
waves
and
andy
noticed
that
they
were
now
of
quite
respectable
size
though
being
directly
above
he
could
not
tell
much
about
it
only
that
in
many
spots
he
saw
the
white
caps
breaking
and
this
served
as
a
pointer
would
the
hydroplane
be
able
to
ride
such
a
sea
in
safety
in
case
necessity
compelled
them
to
alight
upon
its
swelling
bosom
frank
did
not
seem
to
doubt
it
for
he
had
the
utmost
confidence
in
the
ability
of
those
aluminum
pontoons
to
sustain
a
great
weight
without
sinking
what
they
would
possibly
have
to
fear
more
than
anything
else
was
the
chance
of
a
capsize
and
of
course
this
would
spell
disaster
as
much
as
anything
else
once
they
overtook
a
sailing
schooner
that
was
speeding
along
with
a
fair
breeze
possibly
those
aboard
thought
they
were
making
most
excellent
time
with
everything
in
their
favor
but
the
aeroplanes
sped
past
the
vessel
almost
as
though
it
were
a
toy
craft
a
faint
cheer
was
heard
from
those
aboard
who
could
be
seen
wildly
waving
or
red
handkerchiefs
just
as
though
what
they
considered
a
novel
air
race
had
been
engineered
especially
for
their
amusement
when
andy
took
occasion
to
look
backward
again
in
a
short
time
he
was
amazed
to
discover
how
far
distant
the
sails
of
the
schooner
seemed
and
it
was
this
incident
more
than
anything
else
that
gave
him
to
understand
just
what
amazing
speed
the
aeroplanes
were
putting
in
their
mad
race
across
the
inland
sea
but
while
up
to
now
the
voyage
had
been
without
incident
worthy
of
mention
or
accident
of
any
kind
it
could
hardly
be
expected
that
this
immunity
would
continue
to
the
very
end
the
splendid
good
fortune
that
had
hovered
over
both
airships
was
apt
to
be
brought
to
a
sudden
termination
at
any
moment
as
frank
well
knew
chapter
xxii
a
hydroplane
rescue
all
this
while
andy
nerves
had
been
strained
to
a
high
pitch
and
it
was
not
at
all
singular
therefore
that
when
the
anticipated
event
came
to
pass
he
gave
vent
to
a
loud
cry
looky
frank
they
going
to
drop
something
must
have
happened
to
the
motor
or
else
a
plane
guy
broke
to
cripple
them
was
what
he
almost
shrieked
frank
was
watching
though
he
had
not
uttered
a
single
sound
he
knew
that
the
half
expected
crisis
was
now
upon
them
at
least
his
heart
found
cause
for
rejoicing
that
if
an
accident
had
to
happen
it
affected
the
other
aeroplane
rather
than
their
own
it
is
much
easier
to
bear
watching
another
troubles
than
to
bear
your
own
what
andy
had
said
was
the
truth
for
the
craft
they
were
chasing
after
had
taken
a
sudden
dip
and
was
fluttering
downward
if
you
have
ever
seen
a
crippled
bird
trying
hard
to
keep
afloat
you
can
have
a
pretty
good
conception
of
how
that
biplane
dropped
lower
and
lower
toward
the
water
that
it
did
not
fall
like
a
lump
of
lead
spoke
volumes
for
the
magnificent
management
of
the
pilot
who
controlled
the
levers
and
whose
long
experience
had
taught
him
just
what
to
do
in
such
a
dreadful
emergency
as
this
frank
had
instantly
cut
off
much
of
their
power
though
they
still
continued
to
sweep
onward
toward
the
place
of
the
catastrophe
and
were
rapidly
drawing
near
the
falling
aeroplane
both
boys
stared
at
the
terrible
picture
of
the
descending
biplane
nearing
the
heaving
surface
of
the
lake
it
seemed
very
serious
indeed
for
any
one
to
drop
in
this
way
and
yet
how
much
more
dangerous
to
fall
upon
land
where
the
wrecked
aviators
would
stand
a
good
chance
of
broken
limbs
even
though
they
saved
their
necks
then
a
cry
from
the
impulsive
andy
told
that
the
biplane
was
in
the
water
if
the
engine
had
broken
loose
there
was
a
pretty
fair
chance
that
the
craft
with
its
long
extended
planes
would
float
and
even
bear
up
the
two
aviators
perhaps
the
casper
blue
had
looked
out
for
just
such
a
contingency
and
found
a
way
to
free
the
framework
from
the
dead
weight
of
the
motor
frank
had
all
he
could
do
to
manipulate
his
own
craft
for
in
order
to
alight
successfully
even
as
a
wild
duck
does
he
must
make
a
turn
and
head
up
into
the
wind
that
meant
the
passage
of
a
certain
length
of
time
and
meanwhile
who
could
say
what
might
not
be
happening
to
the
imperiled
men
on
the
other
hand
andy
could
not
tear
his
horrified
gaze
away
from
the
wreck
of
the
fallen
biplane
and
it
was
really
upon
him
that
the
navigator
must
depend
for
his
information
as
to
how
things
were
going
fortunately
andy
could
talk
as
well
as
look
no
matter
if
his
tongue
did
show
a
decided
inclination
to
cleave
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
with
horror
he
managed
to
find
a
way
to
make
it
wag
it
floats
frank
sure
it
floats
he
ejaculated
presently
even
as
the
other
was
in
the
act
of
making
a
sweeping
curve
and
skilfully
ducking
a
squally
puff
of
wind
turn
back
over
the
course
they
had
just
covered
to
sink
down
upon
the
heaving
waters
when
he
found
the
chance
yes
they
must
have
kicked
the
engine
overboard
that
makes
three
poor
old
perc
has
lost
do
it
there
they
are
both
of
squattin
in
the
middle
of
the
wreck
just
as
cool
as
you
please
awaitin
for
us
to
call
in
and
take
off
hope
it
do
sink
before
we
get
back
if
either
one
ca
swim
they
go
down
like
a
stone
now
you
around
frank
and
we
heading
straight
for
the
place
hurrah
hold
hard
there
and
we
lend
you
a
helpin
hand
he
even
waved
toward
the
two
men
by
now
pretty
well
submerged
in
the
water
but
who
seemed
to
be
still
clinging
to
the
floating
aeroplane
as
though
recognizing
that
their
position
might
be
much
more
desperate
should
they
cut
loose
from
that
buoy
frank
was
watching
closely
to
pick
out
a
favorable
opportunity
to
alight
well
did
he
know
the
chances
he
and
his
chum
were
taking
in
thus
dropping
upon
the
heaving
surface
of
such
a
tremendous
body
of
water
as
lake
ontario
it
was
true
that
they
had
successfully
performed
this
operation
many
times
with
their
other
hydroplane
but
that
was
upon
the
much
calmer
waters
of
little
sunrise
lake
where
the
sea
never
arose
heavy
enough
to
imperil
the
floating
aircraft
it
would
be
much
more
perilous
now
under
these
conditions
but
frank
had
made
up
his
mind
to
attempt
the
rescue
of
those
in
the
water
and
was
not
to
be
easily
daunted
when
the
right
opening
came
he
allowed
the
hydroplane
to
dip
gently
down
making
sure
that
there
was
as
little
violence
as
possible
in
the
drop
because
of
the
chance
of
burying
the
forward
propeller
under
or
losing
his
balance
upon
which
so
much
depended
andy
knew
what
he
was
expected
to
do
and
was
nimbly
endeavoring
to
swing
his
weight
this
way
or
that
after
they
had
launched
on
the
waves
so
as
to
keep
the
pontoons
on
an
even
keel
and
prevent
a
disastrous
spill
for
once
this
occurred
the
hydroplane
would
be
of
little
more
advantage
than
the
wrecked
biplane
which
barely
upheld
the
two
clinging
men
and
was
evidently
sinking
lower
under
the
strain
with
each
passing
second
until
the
end
must
be
in
sight
at
least
they
had
dropped
safely
the
pontoons
had
been
cleverly
adjusted
so
as
to
bear
a
just
proportion
of
the
weight
and
they
did
their
duty
faithfully
and
well
in
this
great
crisis
of
course
the
next
thing
was
to
try
and
work
closer
to
the
sinking
biplane
and
take
the
men
aboard
one
at
a
time
that
would
be
a
risky
proceeding
requiring
all
the
skill
that
frank
could
bring
to
the
front
in
the
first
place
he
had
chosen
to
drop
beyond
the
wreck
of
biplane
this
he
had
purposely
done
in
the
hope
that
the
wind
might
drift
them
down
upon
the
other
aircraft
a
minute
observation
convinced
frank
however
that
if
they
waited
for
this
to
happen
the
frail
support
which
was
buoying
casper
blue
and
his
mate
up
would
have
gone
under
long
long
before
they
could
get
within
touch
already
the
second
man
was
shrieking
for
them
to
hurry
because
he
could
feel
himself
slowly
but
surely
sinking
and
he
let
them
know
that
he
could
not
swim
a
stroke
plainly
then
they
must
do
something
to
quicken
things
if
they
meant
to
be
of
any
service
to
the
two
rogues
thus
brought
to
a
sudden
halt
just
when
escape
had
seemed
most
bright
frank
remembered
his
engine
but
would
it
work
under
such
strange
conditions
as
this
he
quickly
saw
that
the
rear
propeller
was
half
buried
in
the
water
and
if
it
turned
at
all
would
have
to
churn
things
just
as
though
they
were
in
truth
a
queerly
fashioned
boat
instead
of
an
airship
intended
to
mount
to
lofty
heights
and
vie
with
the
eagle
in
his
circling
above
the
clouds
quickly
then
he
started
to
make
the
trial
and
andy
seeing
his
movement
comprehended
what
he
must
have
in
mind
for
he
swung
out
in
such
fashion
as
to
preserve
a
balance
and
thus
help
things
along
as
far
as
lay
in
his
power
what
a
sensation
of
relief
that
hum
of
the
faithful
little
kincaid
engine
brought
in
its
train
as
it
once
more
took
up
the
burden
of
its
busy
song
why
it
seemed
to
andy
as
though
he
could
almost
shout
in
sudden
relief
when
he
heard
it
first
and
saw
the
water
flying
from
the
partly
submerged
propeller
but
frank
was
wise
enough
not
to
turn
on
full
speed
knowing
what
a
terrific
strain
this
condition
of
affairs
must
be
upon
the
entire
fabric
flimsy
at
best
and
if
anything
gave
way
it
was
all
over
with
them
for
if
a
chain
is
only
as
strong
as
its
weakest
link
a
flying
machine
certainly
comes
under
the
same
category
we
going
it
frank
shouted
andy
when
he
saw
that
their
speed
had
increased
several
hundred
per
cent
and
that
they
were
now
heading
straight
for
the
partly
submerged
air
navigators
it
never
occurred
to
andy
that
either
of
the
men
might
offer
the
slightest
objection
to
being
rescued
frank
looked
a
little
further
ahead
but
even
he
could
hardly
believe
that
casper
blue
would
prefer
to
drown
rather
than
be
saved
what
frank
was
really
concerning
himself
about
more
than
anything
else
was
how
he
could
stow
away
the
two
fellows
once
they
found
a
chance
to
climb
aboard
the
hydroplane
and
whether
he
could
get
enough
impetus
from
the
engine
with
such
an
unusual
load
to
rise
from
the
water
once
he
elevated
his
planes
hurry
oh
hurry
i
going
down
cried
the
larger
man
casper
never
said
a
word
possibly
being
a
swimmer
he
did
not
feel
the
same
degree
of
terror
that
his
companion
experienced
then
again
he
may
have
been
coolly
figuring
on
how
he
might
turn
the
rescue
to
his
own
advantage
in
some
way
for
he
seemed
to
have
that
little
black
box
slung
over
his
back
by
means
of
the
strap
and
it
was
easy
to
understand
that
it
must
as
andy
had
guessed
contain
something
of
considerable
more
value
than
a
mere
camera
now
they
were
closing
in
the
hydroplane
was
being
carried
out
in
what
seemed
to
be
a
successful
manner
and
if
all
went
well
during
the
next
few
minutes
the
drifting
fugitives
would
be
hauled
aboard
by
andy
who
stood
ready
to
act
the
part
of
gallant
rescuer
to
the
taste
it
happened
by
mere
accident
that
they
were
on
that
side
of
the
sinking
wreck
where
the
larger
man
clung
and
this
was
just
as
it
should
have
been
since
he
seemed
more
in
need
of
help
at
least
in
far
greater
distress
of
mind
than
the
smaller
man
get
ready
andy
warned
the
pilot
i
shut
off
the
power
if
it
seems
best
but
it
may
keep
us
on
a
more
even
keel
if
we
move
along
i
going
to
try
and
get
hold
and
then
pull
him
aboard
hope
we
have
a
spill
though
the
other
sent
back
as
he
braced
himself
as
best
the
conditions
allowed
frank
gave
one
little
turn
to
the
rudder
for
he
was
afraid
that
they
might
get
past
without
coming
in
reach
then
the
gap
was
completed
and
andy
leaning
over
managed
to
get
hold
of
the
sinking
man
by
the
collar
of
his
coat
there
was
where
the
greatest
danger
lay
when
a
man
or
a
boy
has
the
terror
of
drowning
pressed
in
upon
his
heart
he
is
usually
a
most
unreasonable
being
and
will
even
clasp
his
intended
rescuer
about
the
neck
and
prevent
him
from
carrying
out
his
plans
that
might
have
worked
well
only
for
this
blundering
take
it
easy
you
yelled
andy
as
he
saw
the
man
clutch
hold
of
the
framework
of
the
hydroplane
and
struggle
desperately
to
work
his
way
along
to
where
the
others
were
if
you
give
us
half
a
chance
we
save
you
all
right
but
upset
us
and
well
all
like
as
not
go
down
together
slower
i
tell
you
or
i
give
you
this
to
teach
you
something
this
ai
an
ocean
liner
d
understand
let
up
whether
it
was
the
excited
words
of
the
boy
the
manner
in
which
he
flourished
that
short
steel
bar
or
his
ferocious
looks
that
brought
the
excited
man
to
his
senses
no
one
could
ever
say
but
he
did
relax
some
of
his
frantic
movements
and
began
to
act
more
within
reason
this
presently
gave
andy
the
opportunity
he
wanted
to
stretch
out
a
helping
hand
and
get
a
firm
grip
of
the
other
coat
collar
after
which
he
exerted
himself
to
the
utmost
to
assist
him
to
climb
aboard
what
with
his
own
weight
and
the
fact
that
his
clothes
were
dripping
with
water
the
addition
of
the
new
passenger
caused
the
delicately
constructed
and
already
heavily
freighted
hydroplane
to
sink
more
deeply
frank
in
that
supreme
moment
realized
that
it
would
be
almost
a
hopeless
task
to
think
of
once
more
flying
with
such
a
cargo
aboard
possibly
the
best
they
could
do
would
be
to
keep
afloat
and
hope
that
the
pursuing
tug
might
come
up
with
them
before
the
darkness
set
in
and
they
could
all
be
rescued
now
that
the
first
of
the
imperiled
airmen
had
been
hauled
aboard
there
remained
but
casper
blue
himself
the
wreck
had
not
as
yet
sunk
wholly
since
relieved
from
the
weight
of
the
heavy
man
it
seemed
to
possess
enough
buoyancy
to
remain
on
the
surface
of
the
water
but
this
could
be
only
for
a
short
time
the
planes
would
soon
be
thoroughly
soaked
and
then
the
end
must
come
when
the
clinging
man
would
find
himself
deprived
of
all
support
and
must
swim
or
go
down
he
had
something
of
a
half
defiant
look
on
his
small
sunburned
face
as
he
saw
andy
trying
to
draw
the
wreck
toward
him
with
the
evident
intention
of
giving
him
the
next
opening
perhaps
he
was
half
inclined
to
take
his
chances
as
he
was
rather
than
allow
these
two
boys
to
make
him
a
prisoner
frank
had
his
mind
made
up
he
figured
that
both
men
had
been
long
enough
in
the
water
to
have
their
weapons
well
soaked
so
that
they
would
be
in
no
condition
to
threaten
their
rescuers
the
box
make
him
pass
it
up
first
or
we
leave
him
here
he
called
out
to
andy
as
the
latter
was
about
to
reach
out
and
lay
hold
of
the
smaller
man
casper
blue
glared
almost
savagely
at
frank
for
the
moment
the
bird
boys
even
thought
the
enraged
man
would
hurl
defiance
back
at
them
and
declare
that
he
preferred
taking
his
chances
with
the
wreck
rather
than
give
up
the
spoils
but
just
then
it
happened
fortunately
that
the
remnant
of
the
biplane
began
to
settle
more
positively
than
before
warning
him
that
it
was
folly
to
pin
any
hope
on
its
buoying
him
up
more
than
a
few
minutes
at
most
here
take
it
he
snarled
handing
up
the
box
which
andy
immediately
passed
over
to
his
cousin
before
he
would
stretch
out
his
hand
again
to
render
the
defeated
yeggman
any
assistance
then
casper
blue
was
drawn
aboard
and
lower
still
sank
the
buoyant
hydroplane
until
both
propellers
were
almost
wholly
submerged
beneath
the
surface
of
the
heaving
billows
that
came
rolling
on
steadily
and
remorselessly
chapter
xxiii
brought
to
book
conclusion
what
time
is
it
frank
asked
andy
who
w
as
breathing
very
hard
after
his
recent
exertions
in
helping
both
men
to
get
a
footing
on
the
hydroplane
i
think
pretty
close
to
four
replied
the
other
though
he
made
no
attempt
to
take
out
the
little
nickel
watch
he
always
carried
nowadays
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
frank
did
not
dare
trust
casper
blue
he
could
see
that
the
little
man
was
a
desperate
character
and
that
he
did
not
view
the
prospect
of
being
made
a
prisoner
and
taken
back
to
bloomsbury
with
any
great
show
of
enthusiasm
in
fact
it
was
a
most
unpleasant
proposition
for
the
bank
thief
to
contemplate
at
all
and
so
frank
was
watching
him
closely
he
had
before
starting
on
this
dangerous
air
flight
that
had
ended
so
far
from
home
and
under
such
singular
conditions
placed
a
little
pistol
in
his
pocket
though
hardly
under
the
belief
that
he
would
have
any
occasion
to
make
use
of
it
but
he
was
now
determined
not
to
let
this
man
get
the
upper
hand
he
could
see
that
various
desperate
plans
must
be
forming
in
that
scheming
brain
of
the
aviator
and
now
yeggman
and
frank
was
constantly
on
the
watch
so
that
he
might
not
be
caught
napping
four
repeated
andy
that
would
mean
at
least
two
more
hours
before
the
sun
set
would
it
and
even
after
that
it
might
stay
light
enough
another
hour
for
them
to
see
us
if
they
steamed
along
you
mean
the
people
aboard
that
tug
do
you
asked
casper
blue
sneeringly
yes
they
seemed
to
be
chasing
after
us
and
i
only
hope
they
do
keep
moving
replied
andy
because
they
must
have
seen
the
accident
that
is
if
they
had
any
sort
of
a
marine
glass
aboard
which
i
reckon
they
did
and
i
suppose
now
you
think
there
might
be
officers
aboard
that
same
tug
the
other
went
on
to
say
oh
we
do
know
anything
about
that
andy
remarked
carelessly
but
if
they
came
along
after
a
while
it
save
us
from
a
lot
of
worrying
just
think
if
the
night
set
in
and
the
four
of
us
weighing
this
poor
old
hydroplane
down
like
we
are
what
a
time
we
have
before
another
morning
came
around
it
would
like
as
not
rise
if
there
was
only
two
aboard
would
it
casper
asked
quickly
and
before
andy
could
understand
what
his
question
meant
he
had
replied
to
it
sure
thing
frank
and
myself
have
left
the
water
many
a
time
in
a
less
powerful
hydroplane
than
this
have
we
frank
well
turn
about
is
only
fair
said
casper
fiercely
why
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
by
that
complained
andy
two
company
four
a
crowd
so
please
skip
out
of
this
both
of
you
boys
my
pal
and
me
can
run
this
shebang
and
just
take
my
word
for
it
we
mean
to
do
the
same
get
that
straight
both
of
you
now
jump
i
tell
you
and
lively
or
i
might
be
tempted
to
let
her
go
and
that
would
be
a
shame
after
the
way
you
rescued
the
two
of
us
overboard
with
you
andy
gaped
when
he
saw
that
the
man
had
actually
drawn
out
a
revolver
and
was
aiming
the
same
directly
at
him
here
quit
that
will
you
he
demanded
feeling
a
flush
of
alarm
for
even
a
seasoned
veteran
of
many
battles
does
not
fancy
having
such
a
threatening
weapon
thrust
under
his
nose
jump
then
d
hear
consarn
you
shouted
the
man
menacingly
waving
his
pistol
take
a
header
and
over
you
go
both
of
you
i
a
desperate
man
and
not
to
be
fooled
with
you
keep
afloat
on
that
wreckage
long
enough
for
the
tug
to
come
up
and
pull
you
in
but
no
matter
over
you
go
one
way
or
the
other
just
wait
a
bit
casper
said
a
quiet
voice
and
turning
his
head
the
man
saw
that
frank
had
him
covered
very
neatly
you
must
know
that
your
weapon
has
been
soaked
and
would
go
off
the
chances
are
besides
i
do
believe
there
a
single
cartridge
in
the
chambers
throw
it
overboard
do
you
hear
casper
or
i
may
be
tempted
to
cripple
that
other
arm
of
yours
no
doubt
frank
was
speaking
the
exact
truth
when
he
declared
his
belief
that
the
revolver
had
not
been
charged
since
the
time
when
casper
emptied
it
at
the
pursuing
airship
in
the
hope
of
either
frightening
the
boy
aviators
or
else
doing
some
sort
of
damage
he
stared
hard
at
frank
for
half
a
minute
then
with
some
muttered
words
as
if
he
realized
the
folly
of
butting
up
against
fate
threw
the
useless
weapon
far
out
on
the
heaving
surface
of
the
lake
after
that
a
dense
silence
fell
upon
them
the
men
were
too
to
want
to
talk
and
there
was
little
that
the
boys
had
to
communicate
because
they
were
now
in
a
position
where
they
could
do
absolutely
nothing
to
help
themselves
and
must
depend
entirely
upon
the
coming
of
the
tug
an
hour
passed
and
it
seemed
very
long
all
of
them
were
more
or
less
wet
because
of
the
splashing
waves
but
as
the
air
was
balmy
they
cared
little
for
such
a
thing
as
that
if
only
the
tug
would
show
up
innumerable
times
did
andy
stretch
his
neck
and
look
toward
the
quarter
in
which
it
must
appear
if
it
came
at
all
but
the
hour
began
to
extend
far
into
a
second
one
and
as
yet
there
was
nothing
seen
that
brought
with
it
a
ray
of
hope
worse
still
the
sea
was
gradually
getting
more
and
more
tempestuous
it
seemed
to
andy
though
the
sky
remained
absolutely
clear
and
there
was
not
a
sign
of
a
storm
if
that
had
been
a
fog
in
the
far
distance
which
frank
had
sighted
the
breeze
must
have
long
ago
dissipated
it
entirely
lower
sank
the
sun
until
it
was
now
not
more
than
half
an
hour
above
the
horizon
if
its
stay
could
be
measured
in
the
way
of
minutes
and
seconds
oh
if
only
the
friendly
tug
would
come
in
sight
amidst
the
waves
it
was
really
getting
to
be
too
much
of
a
good
thing
trying
to
keep
the
hydroplane
from
keeling
over
with
those
waves
breaking
against
the
frail
planes
if
this
kept
up
much
longer
frank
was
very
much
afraid
that
percy
carberry
would
not
be
the
only
boy
in
bloomsbury
to
mourn
the
loss
of
an
airship
when
therefore
andy
gave
a
sudden
shout
and
announced
that
he
believed
he
had
seen
the
smoke
of
the
tug
wreathing
above
the
waves
all
of
them
looked
considerably
relieved
even
casper
himself
for
on
second
thoughts
the
yeggman
must
have
decided
that
it
was
better
to
be
alive
and
in
prison
than
dead
and
under
the
waters
of
lake
ontario
in
five
minutes
they
could
all
see
the
smokestack
of
the
powerful
tug
and
for
fear
lest
it
should
pass
by
and
not
do
them
any
good
they
shouted
hoarsely
in
unison
they
hear
us
exclaimed
andy
whose
position
somehow
allowed
him
to
see
better
than
any
of
the
others
yes
they
changed
their
course
and
are
heading
this
way
now
it
all
right
frank
we
won
out
i
guess
but
frank
was
keeping
an
eye
on
the
two
men
he
did
not
mean
to
give
them
even
the
slightest
chance
to
play
a
trick
in
the
eleventh
hour
frank
bird
was
a
pretty
hard
fellow
to
catch
napping
he
usually
had
his
eyes
open
and
especially
when
he
knew
there
was
danger
around
the
tug
came
booming
on
and
they
could
see
that
there
were
quite
a
number
of
people
aboard
what
if
some
of
them
are
from
bloomsbury
suggested
andy
at
which
his
cousin
laughed
you
did
stop
to
think
twice
before
you
made
that
break
andy
he
remarked
tell
me
by
what
conveyance
could
they
have
got
to
the
lake
ahead
of
us
when
we
came
through
by
lightning
express
at
the
rate
of
nearly
a
hundred
miles
an
hour
at
times
but
i
can
see
they
are
expecting
to
take
charge
of
our
friends
here
because
there
an
officer
aboard
just
keep
where
you
are
casper
your
goose
is
cooked
and
there
no
need
of
making
matters
worse
the
man
settled
back
again
with
a
growl
and
then
burst
out
into
a
reckless
laugh
small
difference
it
makes
i
guess
boys
how
the
thing
done
so
long
as
we
got
to
go
to
the
you
might
just
as
well
have
the
credit
for
the
job
as
anybody
and
man
to
man
now
i
want
to
say
that
i
full
of
admiration
for
the
fine
way
you
handled
that
hydroplane
of
yours
if
so
be
you
the
bird
boys
i
been
hearing
so
much
about
you
got
the
making
of
aviators
in
you
that
about
all
from
me
now
the
tug
came
alongside
and
the
two
men
were
assisted
aboard
where
the
police
officer
saw
that
they
were
promptly
ironed
we
got
the
word
from
bloomsbury
and
your
father
hired
this
tug
right
away
andy
bird
to
follow
you
out
on
the
lake
if
so
be
you
kept
after
the
rascals
said
a
tall
gentleman
with
a
white
mustache
who
they
afterwards
learned
was
the
mayor
of
the
city
on
the
lake
shore
now
what
can
we
do
for
you
please
stand
by
and
let
see
if
we
can
get
away
answered
frank
if
not
we
have
to
go
on
board
and
tow
the
hydroplane
behind
but
since
relieved
of
so
much
extra
weight
the
pontoons
have
risen
again
and
i
expect
she
go
and
she
did
with
the
very
first
effort
beginning
to
move
over
the
surface
of
the
water
in
the
lee
of
the
tug
then
as
frank
hastened
to
elevate
the
planes
the
airship
started
to
mount
and
when
free
from
the
lake
a
mighty
cheer
broke
from
the
lips
of
those
aboard
the
small
vessel
even
casper
blue
joining
in
giving
the
brave
lads
their
just
dues
frank
carefully
started
back
toward
the
american
side
of
the
lake
he
did
not
know
whether
the
capture
had
been
made
on
the
canadian
side
or
not
and
as
the
question
was
never
raised
even
in
the
trail
of
the
bank
robbers
it
was
never
wholly
clear
in
his
mind
when
they
reached
land
it
was
early
night
and
save
that
the
wind
had
lulled
considerably
they
would
not
have
been
able
to
get
in
for
a
long
time
after
that
as
there
was
no
need
of
their
hurrying
homeward
frank
and
andy
consented
to
stay
over
as
the
guests
of
the
mayor
who
was
more
than
pleased
to
have
the
famous
bird
boys
stop
under
his
roof
but
first
frank
made
sure
to
send
a
message
to
each
of
their
homes
as
well
as
to
chief
waller
who
would
have
to
come
on
and
get
the
two
bold
men
who
had
broken
into
the
bloomsbury
bank
and
about
cleaned
out
the
vault
and
not
content
with
one
haul
were
planning
to
rob
the
when
it
stopped
in
bloomsbury
to
settle
with
a
large
number
of
employees
centering
there
doubtless
that
must
have
been
a
season
of
considerable
excitement
in
the
home
town
and
the
names
of
frank
and
andy
bird
were
cheered
to
the
echo
by
the
crowds
of
town
boys
larry
and
elephant
would
lead
around
burning
red
lights
and
firing
off
roman
candles
purchased
with
money
supplied
by
and
professor
bird
the
happy
fathers
of
the
two
young
heroes
on
the
following
day
chief
waller
was
on
hand
with
one
of
his
men
to
escort
the
prisoners
back
to
the
town
where
their
latest
crime
had
been
committed
frank
had
already
sent
the
little
camera
box
with
its
valuable
contents
just
as
he
had
received
it
from
casper
blue
to
the
president
of
the
bank
by
express
not
caring
to
hold
it
any
longer
in
his
hands
than
was
absolutely
necessary
about
noon
the
conditions
being
favorable
the
bird
boys
sailed
away
amidst
the
cheers
of
half
the
little
city
and
headed
directly
south
on
a
bee
line
for
home
fortunately
enough
no
further
adventures
overtook
them
on
their
way
there
and
as
their
coming
had
been
announced
they
found
the
whole
town
in
an
uproar
and
came
near
being
mobbed
such
was
the
desire
of
every
man
woman
boy
and
girl
to
have
the
honor
of
shaking
hands
with
them
percy
was
on
hand
too
with
a
thousand
questions
concerning
the
fate
of
his
precious
biplane
and
bemoaning
the
fact
that
he
seemed
to
be
the
most
unlucky
fellow
who
had
ever
attempted
to
bring
honors
to
bloomsbury
but
there
were
precious
few
who
sympathized
with
him
and
everybody
knew
that
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
demand
that
his
mother
advance
the
ready
cash
to
buy
another
flier
and
it
was
sure
to
be
forthcoming
but
there
were
other
lively
times
in
store
for
frank
and
andy
bird
although
neither
of
them
suspected
it
just
then
and
believed
that
a
period
of
calm
would
likely
follow
their
hydroplane
what
the
nature
of
these
exploits
were
