chapter
i
the
when
i
was
a
child
in
a
spaewife
came
to
the
and
for
a
silver
groat
paid
by
my
mother
she
riddled
my
fate
it
came
to
little
being
no
more
than
that
i
should
miss
love
and
fortune
in
the
sunlight
and
find
them
in
the
rain
the
woman
was
a
haggard
gipsy
and
when
my
mother
asked
for
more
she
turned
on
her
heel
and
spoke
gibberish
for
which
she
was
presently
driven
out
of
the
place
by
tarn
roberton
the
baillie
and
the
village
dogs
but
the
thing
stuck
in
my
memory
and
together
with
the
fact
that
i
was
a
thursday
bairn
and
so
according
to
the
old
rhyme
had
far
to
go
convinced
me
long
ere
i
had
come
to
man
estate
that
wanderings
and
surprises
would
be
my
portion
it
is
in
the
rain
that
this
tale
begins
i
was
just
turned
of
eighteen
and
in
the
of
a
dripping
september
set
out
from
our
moorland
house
of
auchencairn
to
complete
my
course
at
edinburgh
college
the
year
was
an
ill
year
for
our
countryside
for
the
folk
were
at
odds
with
the
king
government
about
religion
and
the
land
was
full
of
covenants
and
repressions
small
wonder
that
i
was
backward
with
my
colleging
and
at
an
age
when
most
lads
are
buckled
to
a
calling
was
still
attending
the
prelections
of
the
edinburgh
masters
my
father
had
blown
hot
and
cold
in
politics
for
he
was
fiery
and
unstable
by
nature
and
swift
to
judge
a
cause
by
its
latest
professor
he
had
cast
out
with
the
hamilton
gentry
and
having
broken
the
head
of
a
dragoon
in
the
of
lesmahagow
had
his
little
estate
mulcted
in
fines
all
of
which
together
with
some
natural
curiosity
and
a
family
love
of
fighting
sent
him
to
the
field
of
bothwell
brig
from
which
he
was
lucky
to
escape
with
a
bullet
in
the
shoulder
thereupon
he
had
been
put
to
the
horn
and
was
now
lying
hid
in
a
den
in
the
mosses
of
douglas
water
it
was
a
sore
business
for
my
mother
who
had
the
task
of
warding
off
prying
eyes
from
our
ragged
household
and
keeping
the
fugitive
in
life
she
was
a
tweedside
woman
as
strong
and
staunch
as
an
oak
and
with
a
heart
in
her
like
robert
bruce
and
she
was
cheerful
too
in
the
worst
days
and
would
go
about
the
place
with
a
bright
eye
and
an
old
song
on
her
lips
but
the
thing
was
beyond
a
woman
bearing
so
i
had
perforce
to
forsake
my
colleging
and
take
a
hand
with
our
family
vexations
the
life
made
me
hard
and
watchful
trusting
no
man
and
brusque
and
stiff
towards
the
world
and
yet
all
the
while
youth
was
working
in
me
like
yeast
so
that
a
spring
day
or
a
west
wind
would
make
me
forget
my
troubles
and
thirst
to
be
about
a
kindlier
business
than
skulking
in
a
moorland
dwelling
my
mother
besought
me
to
leave
her
what
she
would
say
has
young
blood
to
do
with
this
bickering
of
kirks
and
old
wives
lamentations
you
have
to
learn
and
see
and
do
andrew
and
it
time
you
were
beginning
but
i
would
not
listen
to
her
till
by
the
mercy
of
god
we
got
my
father
safely
forth
of
scotland
and
heard
that
he
was
dwelling
snugly
at
leyden
in
as
great
patience
as
his
nature
allowed
thereupon
i
bethought
me
of
my
neglected
colleging
and
leaving
my
books
and
plenishing
to
come
by
the
lanark
carrier
set
out
on
foot
for
edinburgh
the
distance
is
only
a
day
walk
for
an
active
man
but
i
started
late
and
purposed
to
sleep
the
night
at
a
cousin
house
by
kirknewton
often
in
bright
summer
days
i
had
travelled
the
road
when
the
moors
lay
yellow
in
the
sun
and
larks
made
a
cheerful
chorus
in
such
weather
it
is
a
pleasant
road
with
long
prospects
to
cheer
the
traveller
and
kindly
to
rest
his
legs
in
but
that
day
it
rained
as
if
the
floodgates
of
heaven
had
opened
when
i
crossed
clyde
by
the
bridge
at
hyndford
the
water
was
swirling
up
to
the
the
ways
were
a
foot
deep
in
mire
and
about
carnwath
the
bog
had
overflowed
and
the
whole
neighbourhood
swam
in
a
loch
it
was
pitiful
to
see
the
hay
afloat
like
and
the
green
oats
scarcely
showing
above
the
black
floods
in
two
minutes
after
starting
i
was
wet
to
the
skin
and
i
thanked
providence
i
had
left
my
little
dutch
behind
me
in
the
by
three
in
the
afternoon
i
was
as
unkempt
as
any
tinker
my
hair
plastered
over
my
eyes
and
every
fold
of
my
coat
running
like
a
gutter
presently
the
time
came
for
me
to
leave
the
road
and
take
the
over
the
moors
but
in
the
deluge
where
the
eyes
could
see
no
more
than
a
yard
or
two
into
a
grey
wall
of
rain
i
began
to
misdoubt
my
knowledge
of
the
way
on
the
left
i
saw
a
stone
dovecot
and
a
cluster
of
trees
about
a
gateway
so
knowing
how
few
and
remote
were
the
dwellings
on
the
moorland
i
judged
it
wiser
to
seek
guidance
before
i
strayed
too
far
the
place
was
grown
up
with
grass
and
sore
neglected
weeds
made
a
carpet
on
the
avenue
and
the
dykes
were
broke
by
cattle
at
a
dozen
places
suddenly
through
the
falling
water
there
stood
up
the
gaunt
end
of
a
house
it
was
no
cot
or
farm
but
a
proud
mansion
though
badly
needing
repair
a
low
stone
wall
bordered
a
pleasance
but
the
garden
had
fallen
out
of
order
and
a
lay
flat
on
the
earth
my
first
thought
was
that
the
place
was
tenantless
till
i
caught
sight
of
a
thin
spire
of
smoke
struggling
against
the
downpour
i
hoped
to
come
on
some
gardener
or
groom
from
whom
i
could
seek
direction
so
i
skirted
the
pleasance
to
find
the
kitchen
door
a
glow
of
fire
in
one
of
the
rooms
cried
welcome
to
my
shivering
bones
and
on
the
far
side
of
the
house
i
found
signs
of
better
care
the
rank
grasses
had
been
mown
to
make
a
walk
and
in
a
corner
flourished
a
little
group
of
but
there
was
no
man
to
be
seen
and
i
was
about
to
retreat
and
try
the
when
out
of
the
doorway
stepped
a
girl
she
was
maybe
sixteen
years
old
tall
and
but
of
her
face
i
could
see
little
since
she
was
all
muffled
in
a
great
cloak
the
hood
of
it
covered
her
hair
and
the
wide
flaps
were
folded
over
her
bosom
she
sniffed
the
chill
wind
and
held
her
head
up
to
the
rain
and
all
the
while
in
a
clear
childish
voice
she
was
singing
it
was
a
song
i
had
heard
one
made
by
the
great
montrose
who
had
suffered
shameful
death
in
edinburgh
thirty
years
before
it
was
a
man
song
full
of
pride
and
daring
and
not
for
the
lips
of
a
young
maid
but
that
hooded
girl
in
the
wild
weather
sang
it
with
a
challenge
and
a
fire
that
no
cavalier
could
have
bettered
my
dear
and
only
love
i
pray
that
little
world
of
thee
be
governed
by
no
other
sway
than
purest
monarchy
for
if
confusion
have
a
part
which
virtuous
souls
abhor
and
hold
a
synod
in
thy
heart
i
never
love
thee
more
so
she
sang
like
youth
daring
fortune
to
give
it
aught
but
the
best
the
thing
thrilled
me
so
that
i
stood
gaping
then
she
looked
aside
and
saw
me
your
business
man
she
cried
with
an
imperious
voice
i
took
off
my
bonnet
and
made
an
awkward
bow
madam
i
am
on
my
way
to
edinburgh
i
stammered
for
i
was
mortally
ill
at
ease
with
women
i
am
uncertain
of
the
road
in
this
weather
and
come
to
beg
direction
you
left
the
road
three
miles
back
she
said
but
i
am
for
crossing
the
moors
i
said
she
pushed
back
her
hood
and
looked
at
me
with
laughing
eyes
i
saw
how
dark
those
eyes
were
and
how
raven
black
her
wandering
curls
of
hair
you
have
come
to
the
right
place
she
cried
i
can
direct
you
as
well
as
any
jock
or
sandy
about
the
town
where
are
you
going
to
i
said
kirknewton
for
my
night
lodging
then
march
to
the
right
up
by
yon
planting
till
you
come
to
the
howe
burn
follow
it
to
the
top
and
cross
the
hill
above
its
the
wind
is
blowing
from
the
east
so
keep
it
on
your
right
cheek
that
will
bring
you
to
the
springs
of
the
leith
water
and
in
an
hour
or
two
from
there
you
will
be
back
on
the
highroad
she
used
a
manner
of
speech
foreign
to
our
parts
but
very
soft
and
pleasant
in
the
ear
i
thanked
her
clapped
on
my
dripping
bonnet
and
made
for
the
dykes
beyond
the
garden
once
i
looked
back
but
she
had
no
further
interest
in
me
in
the
mist
i
could
see
her
peering
once
more
skyward
and
through
the
drone
of
the
deluge
came
an
echo
of
her
song
i
serve
thee
in
such
noble
ways
as
never
man
before
i
deck
and
crown
thy
head
with
bays
and
love
thee
more
and
more
the
encounter
cheered
me
greatly
and
lifted
the
depression
which
the
eternal
drizzle
had
settled
on
my
spirits
that
bold
girl
singing
a
martial
ballad
to
the
storm
and
taking
pleasure
in
the
snellness
of
the
air
was
like
a
rousing
summons
or
a
cup
of
heady
wine
the
picture
ravished
my
fancy
the
proud
dark
eye
the
little
wanton
curls
peeping
from
the
hood
the
whole
figure
alert
with
youth
and
life
they
cheered
my
recollection
as
i
trod
that
sour
moorland
i
tried
to
remember
her
song
and
hummed
it
assiduously
till
i
got
some
kind
of
version
which
i
shouted
in
my
tuneless
voice
for
i
was
only
a
young
lad
and
my
life
had
been
bleak
and
barren
small
wonder
that
the
call
of
youth
set
every
fibre
of
me
i
had
done
better
to
think
of
the
road
i
found
the
howe
burn
readily
enough
and
scrambled
up
its
mossy
bottom
by
this
time
the
day
was
wearing
late
and
the
mist
was
deepening
into
the
darker
shades
of
night
it
is
an
eery
business
to
be
out
on
the
hills
at
such
a
season
for
they
are
deathly
quiet
except
for
the
lashing
of
the
storm
you
will
never
hear
a
bird
cry
or
a
sheep
bleat
or
a
weasel
scream
the
only
sound
is
the
drum
of
the
rain
on
the
peat
or
its
plash
on
a
boulder
and
the
low
surge
of
the
swelling
streams
it
is
the
place
and
time
for
dark
deeds
for
the
heart
grows
savage
and
if
two
enemies
met
in
the
hollow
of
the
mist
only
one
would
go
away
i
climbed
the
hill
above
the
howe
keeping
the
wind
on
my
right
cheek
as
the
girl
had
ordered
that
took
me
along
a
rough
ridge
of
mountain
pitted
with
into
which
i
often
stumbled
every
minute
i
expected
to
descend
and
find
the
young
water
of
leith
but
if
i
held
to
my
directions
i
must
still
mount
i
see
now
that
the
wind
must
have
veered
to
the
and
that
my
plan
was
leading
me
into
the
fastnesses
of
the
hills
but
i
would
have
wandered
for
weeks
sooner
than
disobey
the
word
of
the
girl
who
sang
in
the
rain
presently
i
was
on
a
steep
which
i
ascended
only
to
drop
through
a
tangle
of
screes
and
jumper
to
the
mires
of
a
great
bog
when
i
had
crossed
this
more
by
luck
than
good
guidance
i
had
another
scramble
on
the
steeps
where
the
long
tough
heather
clogged
my
footsteps
about
eight
i
awoke
to
the
conviction
that
i
was
hopelessly
lost
and
must
spend
the
night
in
the
wilderness
the
rain
still
fell
unceasingly
through
the
and
i
was
as
sodden
and
bleached
as
the
bent
i
trod
on
a
night
on
the
hills
had
no
terrors
for
me
but
i
was
mortally
cold
and
furiously
hungry
and
my
temper
grew
bitter
against
the
world
i
had
forgotten
the
girl
and
her
song
and
desired
above
all
things
on
earth
a
dry
bed
and
a
chance
of
supper
i
had
been
plunging
and
slipping
in
the
dark
mosses
for
maybe
two
hours
when
looking
down
from
a
little
rise
i
caught
a
gleam
of
light
instantly
my
mood
changed
to
content
it
could
only
be
a
cottage
where
i
might
hope
for
a
peat
fire
a
bicker
of
brose
and
at
the
worst
a
couch
of
dry
bracken
i
began
to
run
to
loosen
my
numbed
limbs
and
presently
fell
headlong
over
a
little
scaur
into
a
when
i
crawled
out
with
peat
plastering
my
face
and
hair
i
found
i
had
lost
my
notion
of
the
light
whereabouts
i
strove
to
find
another
hillock
but
i
seemed
now
to
be
in
a
flat
space
of
bog
i
could
only
grope
blindly
forwards
away
from
the
hoping
that
soon
i
might
come
to
a
lift
in
the
hill
suddenly
from
the
distance
of
about
half
a
mile
there
fell
on
my
ears
the
most
hideous
wailing
it
was
like
the
cats
on
a
frosty
night
it
was
like
the
clanging
of
pots
in
a
tinker
cart
and
it
would
rise
now
and
then
to
a
shriek
of
rhapsody
such
as
i
have
heard
at
clearly
the
sound
was
human
though
from
what
kind
of
crazy
human
creature
i
could
not
guess
had
i
been
less
utterly
forwandered
and
the
night
less
wild
i
think
i
would
have
sped
away
from
it
as
fast
as
my
legs
had
carried
me
but
i
had
little
choice
after
all
i
reflected
the
worst
bedlamite
must
have
food
and
shelter
and
unless
the
gleam
had
been
a
i
foresaw
a
fire
so
i
hastened
in
the
direction
of
the
noise
i
came
on
it
suddenly
in
a
hollow
of
the
moss
there
stood
a
ruined
sheepfold
and
in
the
corner
of
two
walls
some
plaids
had
been
stretched
to
make
a
tent
before
this
burned
a
big
fire
of
heather
roots
and
which
hissed
and
crackled
in
the
rain
round
it
squatted
a
score
of
women
with
plaids
drawn
tight
over
their
heads
who
rocked
and
moaned
like
a
flight
of
witches
and
two
three
men
were
on
their
knees
at
the
edge
of
the
ashes
but
what
caught
my
eye
was
the
figure
that
stood
before
the
tent
it
was
a
long
fellow
who
held
his
arms
to
heaven
and
sang
in
a
great
throaty
voice
the
wild
dirge
i
had
been
listening
to
he
held
a
book
in
one
hand
from
which
he
would
pluck
leaves
and
cast
them
on
the
fire
and
at
every
a
wail
of
ecstasy
would
go
up
from
the
hooded
women
and
kneeling
men
then
with
a
final
howl
he
hurled
what
remained
of
his
book
into
the
flames
and
with
upraised
hands
began
some
sort
of
prayer
i
would
have
fled
if
i
could
but
providence
willed
it
otherwise
the
edge
of
the
bank
on
which
i
stood
had
been
rotted
by
the
rain
and
the
whole
thing
gave
under
my
feet
i
slithered
down
into
the
sheepfold
and
pitched
headforemost
among
the
worshipping
women
and
at
that
with
a
yell
the
long
man
leaped
over
the
fire
and
had
me
by
the
throat
my
bones
were
too
sore
and
weary
to
make
resistance
he
dragged
me
to
the
ground
before
the
tent
while
the
rest
set
up
a
skirling
that
deafened
my
wits
there
he
plumped
me
down
and
stood
glowering
at
me
like
a
cat
with
a
sparrow
who
are
ye
and
what
do
ye
here
disturbing
the
remnant
of
israel
says
he
i
had
no
breath
in
me
to
speak
so
one
of
the
men
answered
some
gangrel
body
precious
john
he
said
nay
said
another
it
a
spy
o
the
amalekites
it
a
herd
frae
linton
way
spoke
up
a
woman
he
favours
the
look
of
one
zebedee
linklater
the
long
man
silenced
her
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
his
prophet
gib
saying
smite
and
spare
not
for
the
cup
of
the
abominations
of
babylon
is
now
full
the
hour
cometh
yea
it
is
at
hand
when
the
elect
of
the
earth
meaning
me
and
two
three
others
will
be
enthroned
above
the
gentiles
and
dagon
and
baal
will
be
cast
down
are
ye
still
in
the
courts
of
bondage
young
man
or
seek
ye
the
true
light
which
the
holy
one
of
israel
has
vouchsafed
to
me
john
gib
his
unworthy
prophet
now
i
knew
into
what
rabble
i
had
strayed
it
was
the
company
who
called
themselves
the
led
by
one
muckle
john
gib
once
a
mariner
of
he
had
long
been
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
the
preachers
holding
certain
strange
heresies
that
discomforted
even
the
wildest
of
the
they
had
clapped
him
into
prison
but
the
man
being
three
parts
mad
had
been
let
go
and
ever
since
had
been
making
strife
in
the
westland
parts
of
clydesdale
i
had
heard
much
of
him
and
never
any
good
it
was
his
way
to
draw
after
him
a
throng
of
demented
women
so
that
the
poor
creatures
forgot
husband
and
bairns
and
followed
him
among
the
mosses
there
were
deeds
of
violence
and
blood
to
his
name
and
the
look
of
him
was
enough
to
spoil
a
man
sleep
he
was
about
six
and
a
half
feet
high
with
a
long
lean
head
and
staring
cheek
bones
his
brows
grew
like
bushes
and
beneath
glowed
his
evil
and
sunken
eyes
i
remember
that
he
had
monstrous
long
arms
which
hung
almost
to
his
knees
and
a
great
hairy
breast
which
showed
through
a
rent
in
his
seaman
jerkin
in
that
strange
place
with
the
dripping
spell
of
night
about
me
and
the
fire
casting
weird
lights
and
shadows
he
seemed
like
some
devil
of
the
hills
awakened
by
magic
from
his
ancient
grave
but
i
saw
it
was
time
for
me
to
be
speaking
up
i
am
neither
gangrel
nor
spy
nor
amalekite
nor
yet
am
i
zebedee
linklater
my
name
is
andrew
garvald
and
i
have
left
my
home
to
make
my
way
to
edinburgh
college
i
tried
a
short
road
in
the
mist
and
here
i
am
nay
but
what
seek
ye
cried
muckle
john
the
lord
has
led
ye
to
our
company
by
his
own
good
way
what
seek
ye
i
say
again
and
yea
a
third
time
i
go
to
finish
my
colleging
i
said
he
laughed
a
harsh
croaking
laugh
little
ye
ken
young
man
we
travel
to
watch
the
surprising
judgment
which
is
about
to
overtake
the
wicked
city
of
edinburgh
an
angel
hath
revealed
it
to
me
in
a
dream
fire
and
brimstone
will
descend
upon
it
as
on
sodom
and
gomorrah
and
it
will
be
consumed
and
wither
away
with
its
cruel
ahabs
and
its
painted
jezebels
its
subtle
doegs
and
its
lying
balaams
its
priests
and
its
judges
and
its
proud
men
of
blood
its
and
its
false
prophets
its
purple
and
damask
its
gold
and
its
fine
linen
and
it
shall
be
as
tyre
and
sidon
so
that
none
shall
know
the
site
thereof
but
we
who
follow
the
lord
and
have
cleansed
his
word
from
human
abominations
shall
leap
as
upon
the
mountains
and
enter
upon
the
heritage
of
the
righteous
from
even
unto
the
crossings
of
jordan
in
reply
to
this
rigmarole
i
asked
for
food
since
my
head
was
beginning
to
swim
from
my
long
fast
this
to
my
terror
put
him
into
a
great
rage
ye
are
carnally
minded
like
the
rest
of
them
ye
will
get
no
fleshly
provender
here
but
if
ye
be
not
besotted
in
your
sins
ye
shall
drink
of
the
water
of
life
that
floweth
freely
and
eat
of
the
honey
and
manna
of
forgiveness
and
then
he
appeared
to
forget
my
very
existence
he
fell
into
a
sort
of
trance
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
vacancy
there
was
a
dead
hush
in
the
place
nothing
but
the
crackle
of
the
fire
and
the
steady
drip
of
the
rain
i
endured
it
as
well
as
i
might
for
though
my
legs
were
sorely
cramped
i
did
not
dare
to
move
an
inch
after
nigh
half
an
hour
he
seemed
to
awake
peace
be
with
you
he
said
to
his
followers
it
is
the
hour
for
sleep
and
prayer
i
john
gib
will
wrestle
all
night
for
your
sake
as
jacob
strove
with
the
angel
with
that
he
entered
the
tent
no
one
spoke
to
me
but
the
ragged
company
sought
each
their
a
woman
with
a
kindly
face
jogged
me
on
the
elbow
and
from
the
neuk
of
her
plaid
gave
me
a
bit
of
oatcake
and
a
piece
of
roasted
moorfowl
this
made
my
supper
with
a
long
drink
from
a
neighbouring
burn
none
hindered
my
movements
so
liking
little
the
smell
of
wet
uncleanly
garments
which
clung
around
the
fire
i
made
my
bed
in
a
heather
bush
in
the
lee
of
a
boulder
and
from
utter
weariness
fell
presently
asleep
chapter
ii
of
a
lady
the
storm
died
away
in
the
night
and
i
awoke
to
a
clear
world
and
the
chill
of
an
autumn
morn
i
was
as
stiff
and
sore
as
if
i
had
been
whipped
my
clothes
were
sodden
and
heavy
and
not
till
i
had
washed
my
face
and
hands
in
the
burn
and
stretched
my
legs
up
the
did
i
feel
restored
to
something
of
my
ordinary
briskness
the
encampment
looked
weird
indeed
as
seen
in
the
cruel
light
of
day
the
women
were
cooking
oatmeal
on
iron
girdles
but
the
fire
burned
smokily
and
the
cake
i
got
was
no
better
than
dough
they
were
a
disjaskit
lot
with
tousled
hair
and
pinched
faces
in
which
shone
hungry
eyes
most
were
barefoot
and
all
but
two
three
were
ancient
beldames
who
should
have
been
at
home
in
the
chimney
corner
i
noticed
one
young
woman
who
had
the
air
of
a
farm
servant
and
two
were
country
wives
who
had
probably
left
a
brood
of
children
to
mourn
them
the
men
were
little
better
one
had
the
sallow
look
of
a
weaver
another
was
a
hind
with
a
big
foolish
face
and
there
was
a
slip
of
a
lad
who
might
once
have
been
a
student
of
divinity
but
each
had
a
daftness
in
the
eye
and
something
weak
and
unwholesome
in
the
visage
so
that
they
were
an
offence
to
the
fresh
gusty
moorland
all
but
muckle
john
himself
he
came
out
of
his
tent
and
prayed
till
the
echoed
it
was
a
tangle
of
bedlamite
ravings
with
long
screeds
from
the
scriptures
intermixed
like
currants
in
a
but
there
was
power
in
the
creature
in
the
strange
lift
of
his
voice
in
his
grim
jowl
and
in
the
fire
of
his
sombre
eyes
the
others
i
pitied
but
him
i
hated
and
feared
on
him
and
his
kind
were
to
be
blamed
all
the
madness
of
the
land
which
had
sent
my
father
overseas
and
desolated
our
dwelling
so
long
as
crazy
prophets
preached
brimstone
and
fire
so
long
would
soldiers
and
cunning
lawyers
profit
by
their
folly
and
often
i
prayed
in
those
days
that
the
two
evils
might
devour
each
other
it
was
time
that
i
was
cutting
loose
from
this
company
and
continuing
my
road
we
were
lying
in
a
wide
trough
of
the
pentland
hills
which
i
well
remembered
the
folk
of
the
plains
called
it
the
cauldstaneslap
and
it
made
an
easy
path
for
sheep
and
cattle
between
the
lothians
and
tweeddale
the
camp
had
been
snugly
chosen
for
except
by
the
gleam
of
a
fire
in
the
dark
it
was
invisible
from
any
distance
muckle
john
was
so
filled
with
his
vapourings
that
i
could
readily
slip
off
down
the
burn
and
join
the
southern
highway
at
the
village
of
linton
i
was
on
the
verge
of
going
when
i
saw
that
which
pulled
me
up
a
rider
was
coming
over
the
moor
the
horse
leaped
the
burn
lightly
and
before
i
could
gather
my
wits
was
in
the
midst
of
the
camp
where
muckle
john
was
vociferating
to
heaven
my
heart
gave
a
great
bound
for
i
saw
it
was
the
girl
who
had
sung
to
me
in
the
rain
she
rode
a
fine
sorrel
with
the
easy
seat
of
a
skilled
horsewoman
she
was
trimly
clad
in
a
green
and
over
the
lace
collar
of
it
her
hair
fell
in
dark
clustering
curls
her
face
was
grave
like
a
determined
child
but
the
winds
of
the
morning
had
whipped
it
to
a
rosy
colour
so
that
into
that
clan
of
tatterdemalions
she
rode
like
proserpine
descending
among
the
gloomy
shades
in
her
hand
she
carried
a
light
a
scream
from
the
women
brought
muckle
john
out
of
his
rhapsodies
he
stared
blankly
at
the
slim
girl
who
confronted
him
with
hand
on
hip
what
seekest
thou
here
thou
shameless
woman
he
roared
i
am
come
said
she
for
my
tirewoman
janet
somerville
who
left
me
three
days
back
without
a
reason
word
was
brought
me
that
she
had
joined
a
mad
company
called
the
that
lay
at
the
cauldstaneslap
janet
a
silly
body
but
she
means
no
ill
and
her
mother
is
demented
at
the
loss
of
her
so
i
have
come
for
janet
her
cool
eyes
ran
over
the
assembly
till
they
lighted
on
the
one
i
had
already
noted
as
more
than
the
rest
at
the
sight
of
the
girl
the
woman
bobbed
a
curtsy
come
out
of
it
silly
janet
said
she
on
the
horse
you
never
make
a
for
there
not
a
notion
of
a
tune
in
your
head
it
not
singing
that
i
seek
my
leddy
said
the
woman
blushing
i
follow
the
call
o
the
lord
by
the
mouth
o
his
servant
john
gib
you
follow
the
call
of
your
mother
by
the
mouth
of
me
elspeth
blair
forget
these
havers
janet
and
come
back
like
a
good
christian
soul
mount
and
be
quick
there
room
behind
me
on
bess
the
words
were
spoken
in
a
kindly
wheedling
tone
and
the
girl
face
broke
into
the
prettiest
of
smiles
perhaps
janet
would
have
obeyed
but
muckle
john
swift
to
prevent
defection
took
up
the
parable
begone
ye
daughter
of
heth
he
bellowed
ye
that
are
like
the
devils
that
pluck
souls
from
the
way
of
salvation
begone
or
it
is
strongly
borne
in
upon
me
that
ye
will
dree
the
fate
of
the
women
of
midian
of
whom
it
is
written
that
they
were
slaughtered
and
spared
not
the
girl
did
not
look
his
way
she
had
her
coaxing
eyes
on
her
halting
maid
come
janet
woman
she
said
again
it
no
job
for
a
decent
lass
to
be
wandering
at
the
tail
of
a
crazy
warlock
the
word
roused
muckle
john
to
fury
he
sprang
forward
caught
the
sorrel
bridle
and
swung
it
round
the
girl
did
not
move
but
looked
him
square
in
the
face
the
young
eyes
fronting
his
demoniac
glower
then
very
swiftly
her
arm
rose
and
she
laid
the
lash
of
her
whip
roundly
over
his
shoulders
the
man
snarled
like
a
beast
leaped
back
and
plucked
from
his
belt
a
great
i
heard
the
click
of
it
cocking
and
the
next
i
knew
it
was
levelled
at
the
girl
breast
the
sight
of
her
and
the
music
of
her
voice
had
so
enthralled
me
that
i
had
made
no
plan
as
to
my
own
conduct
but
this
sudden
peril
put
fire
into
my
heels
and
in
a
second
i
was
at
his
side
i
had
brought
from
home
a
stout
staff
with
which
i
struck
the
muzzle
upwards
the
pistol
went
off
in
a
great
stench
of
powder
but
the
bullet
wandered
to
the
clouds
muckle
john
let
the
thing
fall
into
the
moss
and
plucked
another
weapon
from
his
belt
this
was
an
ugly
knife
such
as
a
cobbler
uses
for
paring
hides
i
knew
the
seaman
trick
of
throwing
having
seen
their
brawls
at
the
pier
of
leith
and
i
had
no
notion
for
the
steel
in
my
throat
the
man
was
far
beyond
me
in
size
and
strength
so
i
dared
not
close
with
him
instead
i
gave
him
the
point
of
my
staff
with
all
my
power
straight
in
the
midriff
the
knife
slithered
harmlessly
over
my
shoulder
and
he
fell
backwards
into
the
heather
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
for
the
whole
clan
came
round
me
like
a
flock
of
daws
one
of
the
men
the
slim
lad
had
a
pistol
but
i
saw
by
the
way
he
handled
it
that
it
was
unprimed
i
was
most
afraid
of
the
women
who
with
their
long
claws
would
have
scratched
my
eyes
out
and
i
knew
they
would
not
spare
the
girl
to
her
i
turned
anxiously
and
to
my
amazement
she
was
laughing
she
recognized
me
for
she
cried
out
is
this
the
way
to
kirknewton
sir
and
all
the
time
she
shook
with
merriment
in
that
hour
i
thought
her
as
daft
as
the
whose
nails
were
uncommonly
near
my
cheek
i
got
her
bridle
tumbled
over
the
countryman
with
a
kick
and
forced
her
to
the
edge
of
the
sheepfold
but
she
wheeled
round
again
crying
i
must
have
janet
and
faced
the
crowd
with
her
whip
that
was
well
enough
but
i
saw
muckle
john
staggering
to
his
feet
and
i
feared
desperately
for
his
next
move
the
girl
was
either
mad
or
extraordinarily
brave
get
back
you
pitiful
knaves
she
cried
lay
a
hand
on
me
and
i
will
cut
you
to
ribbons
make
haste
janet
and
quit
this
folly
it
was
gallant
talk
but
there
was
no
sense
in
it
muckle
john
was
on
his
feet
half
the
clan
had
gone
round
to
our
rear
and
in
a
second
or
two
she
would
have
been
torn
from
the
saddle
a
headstrong
girl
was
beyond
my
management
and
my
words
of
entreaty
were
lost
in
the
babel
of
cries
but
just
then
there
came
another
sound
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
moor
there
closed
in
upon
us
horsemen
they
came
silently
and
were
about
us
before
i
had
a
hint
of
their
presence
it
was
a
troop
of
dragoons
in
the
king
buff
and
scarlet
and
they
rode
us
down
as
if
we
had
been
hares
in
a
field
the
next
i
knew
of
it
i
was
sprawling
on
the
ground
with
a
dizzy
head
and
horses
trampling
around
me
i
had
a
glimpse
of
muckle
john
with
a
pistol
at
his
nose
and
the
sorrel
curveting
and
plunging
in
a
panic
then
i
bethought
myself
of
saving
my
bones
and
crawled
out
of
the
mellay
behind
the
sheepfold
presently
i
realized
that
this
was
the
salvation
i
had
been
seeking
gib
was
being
pinioned
and
two
of
the
riders
were
speaking
with
the
girl
the
women
hung
together
like
hens
in
a
storm
while
the
dragoons
laid
about
them
with
the
flat
of
their
swords
there
was
one
poor
creature
came
running
my
way
and
after
her
followed
on
foot
a
long
fellow
who
made
clutches
at
her
hair
he
caught
her
with
ease
and
proceeded
to
bind
her
hands
with
great
brutality
ye
beldame
he
said
with
many
oaths
i
pare
your
talons
for
ye
now
i
who
a
minute
before
had
been
in
danger
from
this
very
crew
was
smitten
with
a
sudden
compunction
except
for
muckle
john
they
were
so
pitifully
feeble
a
pack
of
humble
elderly
folk
worn
out
with
fasting
and
marching
and
ill
weather
i
had
been
sickened
by
their
crazy
devotions
but
i
was
more
sickened
by
this
man
barbarity
it
was
the
woman
too
who
had
given
me
food
the
night
before
so
i
stepped
out
and
bade
the
man
release
her
he
was
a
huge
sunburned
ruffian
and
for
answer
aimed
a
clour
at
my
head
take
that
my
mannie
he
said
i
learn
ye
to
follow
the
petticoats
his
scorn
put
me
into
a
fury
in
which
anger
at
his
brutishness
and
the
presence
of
the
girl
on
the
sorrel
moved
my
pride
to
a
piece
of
naked
folly
i
flew
at
his
throat
and
since
i
had
stood
on
a
little
eminence
the
force
of
my
assault
toppled
him
over
my
victory
lasted
scarcely
a
minute
he
flung
me
from
him
like
a
feather
then
picked
me
up
and
laid
on
to
me
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
ye
thrawn
jackanapes
he
cried
as
he
beat
me
ye
pay
dear
for
playing
your
pranks
wi
john
donald
i
was
a
child
in
his
mighty
grasp
besides
having
no
breath
left
in
me
to
resist
he
tied
my
hands
and
legs
haled
me
to
his
horse
and
flung
me
over
the
crupper
there
was
no
more
shamefaced
lad
in
the
world
than
me
at
that
moment
for
coming
out
of
the
din
i
heard
a
girl
light
laughter
chapter
iii
the
canongate
tolbooth
never
daunton
youth
was
i
remember
a
saying
of
my
grandmother
but
it
was
the
most
dauntoned
youth
in
scotland
that
now
jogged
over
the
moor
to
the
edinburgh
highroad
i
had
a
swimming
head
and
a
hard
crupper
to
grate
my
ribs
at
every
movement
and
my
captor
would
shift
me
about
with
as
little
gentleness
as
if
i
had
been
a
bag
of
oats
for
his
horse
feed
but
it
was
the
ignominy
of
the
business
that
kept
me
on
the
brink
of
tears
first
i
was
believed
to
be
one
of
the
maniac
company
of
the
whom
my
soul
abhorred
i
had
been
worsted
by
a
trooper
with
shameful
ease
so
that
my
manhood
cried
out
against
me
lastly
i
had
cut
the
sorriest
figure
in
the
eyes
of
that
proud
girl
for
a
moment
i
had
been
bold
and
fancied
myself
her
saviour
but
all
i
had
got
by
it
was
her
mocking
laughter
they
took
us
down
from
the
hill
to
the
highroad
a
little
north
of
linton
village
where
i
was
dumped
on
the
ground
my
legs
untied
and
my
hands
strapped
to
a
stirrup
leather
the
women
were
given
a
country
cart
to
ride
in
and
the
men
including
muckle
john
had
to
run
each
by
a
trooper
leg
the
girl
on
the
sorrel
had
gone
and
so
had
the
maid
janet
for
i
could
not
see
her
among
the
dishevelled
wretches
in
the
cart
the
thought
of
that
girl
filled
me
with
bitter
animosity
she
must
have
known
that
i
was
none
of
gib
company
for
had
i
not
risked
my
life
at
the
muzzle
of
his
pistol
i
had
taken
her
part
as
bravely
as
i
knew
how
but
she
had
left
me
to
be
dragged
to
edinburgh
without
a
word
women
had
never
come
much
my
way
but
i
had
a
boy
distrust
of
the
sex
and
as
i
plodded
along
the
highroad
with
every
now
and
then
a
cuff
from
a
trooper
fist
to
cheer
me
i
had
hard
thoughts
of
their
heartlessness
we
were
a
pitiful
company
as
in
the
bright
autumn
sun
we
came
in
by
the
village
of
liberton
to
where
the
reek
of
edinburgh
rose
straight
into
the
windless
weather
the
women
in
the
cart
kept
up
a
continual
lamenting
and
muckle
john
who
walked
between
two
dragoons
with
his
hands
tied
to
the
saddle
of
each
so
that
he
looked
like
a
crucified
malefactor
polluted
the
air
with
hideous
profanities
he
cursed
everything
in
nature
and
beyond
it
and
no
amount
of
clouts
on
the
head
would
stem
the
torrent
sometimes
he
would
fall
to
howling
like
a
wolf
and
folk
ran
to
their
cottage
doors
to
see
the
portent
groups
of
children
followed
us
from
every
wayside
clachan
so
that
we
gave
great
entertainment
to
the
dwellers
in
lothian
that
day
the
thing
infuriated
the
dragoons
for
it
made
them
a
and
the
sins
of
gib
were
visited
upon
the
more
silent
prisoners
we
were
hurried
along
at
a
cruel
pace
so
that
i
had
often
to
run
to
avoid
the
dragging
at
my
wrists
and
behind
us
bumped
the
cart
full
of
wailful
women
i
was
sick
from
fatigue
and
lack
of
food
and
the
south
port
of
edinburgh
was
a
welcome
sight
to
me
welcome
and
yet
shameful
for
i
feared
at
any
moment
to
see
the
face
of
a
companion
in
the
jeering
crowd
that
lined
the
causeway
i
thought
miserably
of
my
pleasant
lodgings
in
the
bow
where
my
landlady
mistress
macvittie
would
be
looking
at
the
boxes
the
lanark
carrier
had
brought
and
be
wondering
what
had
become
of
their
master
i
saw
no
light
for
myself
in
the
business
my
with
the
government
would
tell
heavily
in
my
disfavour
and
it
was
beyond
doubt
that
i
had
assaulted
a
dragoon
there
was
nothing
before
me
but
the
plantations
or
a
long
spell
in
some
noisome
prison
the
women
were
sent
to
the
house
of
correction
to
be
whipped
and
dismissed
for
there
was
little
against
them
but
foolishness
all
except
one
a
virago
called
isobel
bone
who
was
herded
with
the
men
the
canongate
tolbooth
was
our
portion
the
darkest
and
foulest
of
the
city
prisons
and
presently
i
found
myself
forced
through
a
gateway
and
up
a
narrow
staircase
into
a
little
chamber
in
which
a
score
of
beings
were
already
penned
a
small
unglazed
window
with
iron
bars
high
up
on
one
wall
gave
us
such
light
and
air
as
was
going
but
the
place
reeked
with
human
breathing
and
smelled
as
rank
as
a
kennel
i
have
a
delicate
nose
and
i
could
not
but
believe
on
my
entrance
that
an
hour
of
such
a
hole
would
be
the
death
of
me
soon
the
darkness
came
and
we
were
given
a
tallow
dip
in
a
horn
lantern
hung
on
a
nail
to
light
us
to
food
such
food
i
had
never
dreamed
of
there
was
a
big
iron
basin
of
some
kind
of
broth
made
as
i
judged
from
offal
from
which
we
drank
in
pannikins
and
with
it
were
hunks
of
mildewed
one
mouthful
sickened
me
and
i
preferred
to
fast
the
behaviour
of
the
other
prisoners
was
most
seemly
but
not
so
that
of
my
company
they
scrambled
for
the
stuff
like
pigs
round
a
trough
and
the
woman
isobel
threatened
with
her
nails
any
one
who
would
prevent
her
i
was
black
ashamed
to
enter
prison
with
such
a
crew
and
withdrew
myself
as
far
distant
as
the
chamber
allowed
me
i
had
no
better
task
than
to
look
round
me
at
those
who
had
tenanted
the
place
before
our
coming
there
were
three
women
bodies
who
talked
low
in
whispers
and
knitted
the
men
were
mostly
countryfolk
culled
as
i
could
tell
by
their
speech
from
the
west
country
whose
only
fault
no
doubt
was
that
they
had
attended
some
one
old
man
a
minister
by
his
dress
sat
apart
on
a
stone
bench
and
with
closed
eyes
communed
with
himself
i
ventured
to
address
him
for
in
that
horrid
place
he
had
a
welcome
air
of
sobriety
and
sense
he
asked
me
for
my
story
and
when
he
heard
it
looked
curiously
at
muckle
john
who
was
now
reciting
gibberish
in
a
corner
so
that
is
the
man
gib
he
said
musingly
i
have
heard
tell
of
him
for
he
was
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
of
blessed
cargill
often
have
i
heard
him
repeat
how
he
went
to
gib
in
the
moors
to
reason
with
him
in
the
lord
name
and
got
nothing
but
a
mouthful
of
devilish
blasphemies
he
is
without
doubt
a
child
of
belial
as
much
as
any
proud
persecutor
woe
is
the
kirk
when
her
foes
shall
be
of
her
own
household
for
it
is
with
the
words
of
the
gospel
that
he
seeks
to
overthrow
the
gospel
work
and
how
is
it
with
you
my
son
do
you
seek
to
add
your
testimony
to
the
sweet
savour
which
now
ascends
from
moors
mosses
closes
kennels
prisons
dungeons
ay
and
scaffolds
in
this
distressed
land
of
scotland
you
have
not
told
me
your
name
when
he
heard
it
he
asked
for
my
father
whom
he
had
known
in
old
days
at
edinburgh
college
then
he
inquired
into
my
religious
condition
with
so
much
fatherly
consideration
that
i
could
take
no
offence
but
told
him
honestly
that
i
was
little
of
a
partisan
finding
it
hard
enough
to
keep
my
own
feet
from
temptation
without
judging
others
i
am
weary
i
said
of
all
covenants
and
resolutions
and
excommunications
and
the
constraining
of
men
conscience
either
by
government
or
sectaries
some
day
and
i
pray
that
it
may
be
soon
both
sides
will
be
dead
of
their
wounds
and
there
will
arise
in
scotland
men
who
will
preach
peace
and
tolerance
and
heal
the
grievously
irritated
sores
of
this
land
he
sighed
as
he
heard
me
i
fear
you
are
still
far
from
grace
lad
he
said
you
are
shaping
for
a
laodicean
of
whom
there
are
many
in
these
latter
times
i
do
not
know
it
may
be
that
god
wills
that
the
laodiceans
have
their
day
for
the
fires
of
our
noble
covenant
have
flamed
too
smokily
yet
those
fires
die
not
and
sometime
they
will
kindle
up
purified
and
strengthened
and
will
burn
the
trash
and
stubble
and
warm
god
feckless
people
he
was
so
old
and
gentle
that
i
had
no
heart
for
disputation
and
could
only
beseech
his
blessing
this
he
gave
me
and
turned
once
more
to
his
devotions
i
was
very
weary
my
head
was
splitting
with
the
foul
air
of
the
place
and
i
would
fain
have
got
me
to
sleep
some
dirty
straw
had
been
laid
round
the
walls
of
the
room
for
the
prisoners
to
lie
on
and
i
found
a
neuk
close
by
the
minister
side
but
sleep
was
impossible
for
muckle
john
got
another
fit
of
cursing
he
stood
up
by
the
door
with
his
eyes
blazing
like
a
and
delivered
what
he
called
his
testimony
his
voice
had
been
used
to
shout
orders
on
shipboard
and
not
one
of
us
could
stop
his
ears
against
it
never
have
i
heard
such
a
medley
of
profane
nonsense
he
cursed
the
man
charles
stuart
and
every
councillor
by
name
he
cursed
the
persecutors
from
his
highness
of
york
down
to
one
welch
of
borrowstoneness
who
had
been
the
means
of
his
first
imprisonment
he
cursed
the
indulged
and
tolerated
ministers
and
he
cursed
every
man
of
the
whose
name
he
could
remember
he
testified
against
all
dues
and
cesses
against
all
customs
and
excises
taxes
and
burdens
against
beer
and
ale
and
wines
and
tobacco
against
mumming
and
and
dancing
and
every
sort
of
play
against
christmas
and
easter
and
pentecost
and
hogmanay
then
most
nobly
did
he
embark
on
theology
he
made
short
work
of
hell
and
shorter
work
of
heaven
he
raved
against
idolaters
of
the
kirk
and
of
the
bible
and
against
all
preachers
who
by
his
way
of
it
had
perverted
the
word
as
he
went
on
i
began
to
fancy
that
muckle
john
true
place
was
with
the
mussulmans
for
he
left
not
a
stick
of
christianity
behind
him
such
blasphemy
on
the
open
had
been
shocking
enough
but
in
that
narrow
room
it
was
too
horrid
to
be
borne
the
minister
stuck
his
fingers
in
his
ears
and
advancing
to
the
maniac
bade
him
be
silent
before
god
should
blast
him
but
what
could
his
thin
old
voice
do
against
gib
bellowing
the
mariner
went
on
undisturbed
and
gave
the
old
man
a
blow
with
his
foot
which
sent
him
staggering
to
the
floor
the
thing
had
become
too
much
for
my
temper
i
cried
on
the
other
men
to
help
me
but
none
stirred
for
gib
seemed
to
cast
an
unholy
spell
on
ordinary
folk
but
my
anger
and
discomfort
banished
all
fear
and
i
rushed
at
the
prophet
in
a
whirlwind
he
had
no
eyes
for
my
coming
till
my
head
took
him
fairly
in
the
middle
and
drove
the
breath
out
of
his
chest
that
quieted
his
noise
and
he
turned
on
me
with
something
like
wholesome
human
wrath
in
his
face
now
i
was
no
match
for
this
great
being
with
my
ungrown
strength
but
the
lesson
of
my
encounter
with
the
dragoon
was
burned
on
my
mind
and
i
was
determined
to
keep
out
of
grips
with
him
i
was
light
on
my
feet
and
in
our
country
bouts
had
often
worsted
a
heavier
antagonist
by
my
quickness
in
movement
so
when
muckle
john
leaped
to
grab
me
i
darted
under
his
arm
and
he
staggered
across
the
room
the
women
scuttled
into
a
corner
all
but
the
besom
isobel
who
made
clutches
at
my
coat
crying
the
sword
of
the
lord
and
of
gideon
gib
made
a
great
lunge
at
me
with
his
fist
but
the
sword
of
gideon
missed
its
aim
and
skinned
its
knuckles
on
the
stone
wall
i
saw
now
to
my
great
comfort
that
the
man
was
beside
himself
with
fury
and
was
swinging
his
arms
wildly
like
a
flail
three
or
four
times
i
avoided
his
rushes
noting
with
satisfaction
that
one
of
the
countrymen
had
got
hold
of
the
shrieking
isobel
then
my
chance
came
for
as
he
lunged
i
struck
from
the
side
with
all
my
force
on
his
jaw
i
am
and
the
blow
was
unlocked
for
he
staggered
back
a
step
and
i
deftly
tripped
him
up
so
that
he
fell
with
a
crash
on
the
hard
floor
in
a
second
i
was
on
the
top
of
him
shouting
to
the
others
to
lend
me
a
hand
this
they
did
at
last
and
so
mazed
was
he
with
the
fall
being
a
mighty
heavy
man
that
he
scarcely
resisted
if
you
want
a
quiet
night
i
cried
we
must
silence
this
mountebank
with
three
leathern
belts
one
my
own
and
two
borrowed
we
made
fast
his
feet
and
arms
i
stuffed
a
kerchief
into
his
mouth
and
bound
his
jaws
with
another
but
not
so
tight
as
to
hinder
his
breathing
then
we
rolled
him
into
a
corner
where
he
lay
peacefully
making
the
sound
of
a
milch
cow
chewing
her
cud
i
returned
to
my
quarters
by
the
minister
side
and
presently
from
utter
weariness
fell
into
an
uneasy
sleep
i
woke
in
the
morning
greatly
refreshed
for
all
the
closeness
of
the
air
and
the
memory
of
the
night
events
returning
was
much
concerned
as
to
the
future
i
could
not
be
fighting
with
muckle
john
all
the
time
and
i
made
no
doubt
that
once
his
limbs
were
freed
he
would
try
to
kill
me
the
others
were
still
asleep
while
i
tiptoed
over
to
his
corner
at
first
sight
i
got
a
fearsome
shock
for
i
thought
he
was
dead
of
suffocation
he
had
worked
the
gag
out
of
his
mouth
and
lay
as
still
as
a
corpse
but
soon
i
saw
that
he
was
sleeping
quietly
and
in
his
slumbers
the
madness
had
died
out
of
his
face
he
looked
like
any
other
sailorman
a
trifle
of
countenance
and
dirty
beyond
the
ordinary
of
when
the
gaoler
came
with
food
we
all
wakened
up
and
gib
asked
very
peaceably
to
be
released
the
gaoler
laughed
at
his
predicament
and
inquired
the
tale
of
it
and
when
he
heard
the
truth
called
for
a
vote
as
to
what
he
should
do
i
was
satisfied
from
the
look
of
muckle
john
that
his
dangerous
fit
was
over
so
i
gave
my
voice
for
release
gib
shook
himself
like
a
great
dog
and
fell
to
his
breakfast
without
a
word
i
found
the
thin
brose
provided
more
palatable
than
the
soup
of
the
evening
before
and
managed
to
consume
a
pannikin
of
it
as
i
finished
i
perceived
that
gib
had
squatted
by
my
side
there
was
clearly
some
change
in
the
man
for
he
gave
the
woman
isobel
some
very
ill
words
when
she
started
ranting
up
in
the
little
square
of
window
one
could
see
a
patch
of
clear
sky
with
white
clouds
crossing
it
and
a
gust
of
the
clean
air
of
morning
was
blown
into
our
cell
gib
sat
looking
at
it
with
his
eyes
abstracted
so
that
i
feared
a
renewal
of
his
daftness
can
ye
whistle
nettles
sir
he
asked
me
civilly
it
was
surely
a
queer
request
in
that
place
and
from
such
a
fellow
but
i
complied
and
to
the
best
of
my
skill
rendered
the
air
he
listened
greedily
ay
you
got
it
he
said
humming
it
after
me
i
aye
love
the
way
of
it
yon
the
tune
i
used
to
whistle
on
shipboard
when
the
weather
was
clear
he
had
the
seaman
trick
of
thinking
of
the
weather
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
this
little
thing
wrought
a
change
in
my
view
of
him
his
madness
was
seemingly
like
that
of
an
epileptic
and
when
it
passed
he
was
a
simple
creature
with
a
longing
for
familiar
things
the
wind
to
the
east
he
said
i
could
wish
i
were
beating
down
the
forth
in
the
she
was
a
trim
bit
boat
for
him
that
could
handle
her
man
i
said
what
made
you
leave
a
clean
job
for
the
ravings
of
yesterday
i
in
the
lord
hands
he
said
humbly
i
but
a
penny
whistle
for
his
breath
to
blow
on
this
he
said
with
such
solemnity
that
the
meaning
of
a
fanatic
was
suddenly
revealed
to
me
one
or
two
distorted
notions
a
wild
imagination
and
fierce
passions
and
there
you
have
the
ingredients
ready
but
moments
of
sense
must
come
when
the
better
nature
of
the
man
revives
i
had
a
thought
that
the
clout
he
got
on
the
stone
floor
had
done
much
to
clear
his
wits
what
will
they
do
wi
me
think
ye
he
asked
this
is
the
second
time
i
fallen
into
the
hands
o
the
amalekites
and
it
no
likely
they
let
me
off
sae
lightly
what
will
they
do
with
us
all
said
i
the
plantations
maybe
or
the
bass
it
a
bonny
creel
you
landed
me
in
for
i
as
innocent
as
a
newborn
babe
the
notion
of
the
plantations
seemed
to
comfort
him
i
been
there
afore
once
in
the
brig
o
greenock
and
once
in
the
leith
it
a
het
land
but
a
bonny
and
full
o
all
manner
o
fruits
you
can
see
tobacco
growin
like
aits
and
mair
big
trees
in
one
plantin
than
in
all
the
shire
o
lothian
besides
but
i
got
no
more
of
muckle
john
travels
for
the
door
opened
on
that
instant
and
the
gaoler
appeared
he
looked
at
our
heads
then
singled
me
out
and
cried
on
me
to
follow
come
on
you
he
said
wantit
in
the
captain
room
i
followed
in
bewilderment
for
i
knew
something
of
the
law
delays
and
i
could
not
believe
that
my
hour
of
trial
had
come
already
the
man
took
me
down
the
turret
stairs
and
through
a
long
passage
to
a
door
where
stood
two
halberdiers
through
this
he
thrust
me
and
i
found
myself
in
a
handsome
panelled
apartment
with
the
city
arms
carved
above
the
chimney
a
window
stood
open
and
i
breathed
the
sweet
fresh
air
with
delight
but
i
caught
a
reflection
of
myself
in
the
polished
steel
of
the
fireplace
and
my
spirits
fell
for
a
more
woebegone
ruffian
my
eyes
had
never
seen
i
was
as
dirty
as
a
collier
my
coat
was
half
off
my
back
from
my
handling
on
the
moor
and
there
were
long
rents
at
the
knees
of
my
breeches
another
door
opened
and
two
persons
entered
one
was
a
dapper
little
man
with
a
great
wig
very
handsomely
dressed
in
a
silken
coat
with
a
snowy
cravat
at
his
neck
at
the
sight
of
the
other
my
face
crimsoned
for
it
was
the
girl
who
had
sung
montrose
song
in
the
rain
the
little
gentleman
looked
at
me
severely
and
then
turned
to
his
companion
is
this
the
fellow
elspeth
he
inquired
he
looks
a
sorry
rascal
the
minx
pretended
to
examine
me
carefully
her
colour
was
high
with
the
fresh
morning
and
she
kept
tapping
her
boot
with
her
whip
handle
why
yes
uncle
gregory
she
said
it
is
the
very
man
though
none
the
better
for
your
night
attentions
and
you
say
he
had
no
part
in
gib
company
but
interfered
on
your
behalf
when
the
madman
threatened
you
such
was
his
impertinence
she
said
as
if
i
were
not
a
match
for
a
dozen
crazy
but
doubtless
the
lad
meant
well
it
is
also
recorded
against
him
that
he
assaulted
one
of
his
servants
to
wit
the
trooper
john
donald
and
offered
to
hinder
him
in
the
prosecution
of
his
duty
la
uncle
cried
the
girl
who
is
to
distinguish
friend
from
foe
in
a
mellay
have
you
never
seen
a
dog
in
a
fight
bite
the
hand
of
one
who
would
succour
him
maybe
maybe
said
the
gentleman
your
illustrations
elspeth
would
do
credit
to
his
majesty
advocate
your
plea
is
that
this
young
man
whose
name
i
do
not
know
and
do
not
seek
to
hear
should
be
freed
or
justice
will
miscarry
god
knows
the
law
has
enough
to
do
without
clogging
its
wheels
with
innocence
the
girl
nodded
her
wicked
laughing
eyes
roamed
about
the
apartment
with
little
regard
for
my
flushed
face
then
the
crown
assoilzies
the
panel
and
deserts
the
diet
said
the
little
gentleman
speak
sir
and
thank
his
majesty
for
his
clemency
and
this
lady
for
her
intercession
i
had
no
words
for
if
i
had
been
sore
at
my
imprisonment
i
was
black
angry
at
this
manner
of
release
i
did
not
reflect
that
miss
elspeth
blair
must
have
risen
early
and
ridden
far
to
be
in
the
canongate
at
this
hour
was
justice
only
that
moved
her
i
thought
and
no
gratitude
or
kindness
to
her
i
was
something
so
lowly
that
she
need
not
take
the
pains
to
be
civil
but
must
speak
of
me
in
my
presence
as
if
it
were
a
question
of
a
stray
hound
my
first
impulse
was
to
refuse
to
stir
but
happily
my
good
sense
returned
in
time
and
preserved
me
from
playing
the
fool
i
thank
you
sir
i
said
gruffly
and
the
lady
do
i
understand
that
i
am
free
to
go
through
the
door
down
the
left
stairway
and
you
will
be
in
the
street
said
the
gentleman
i
made
some
sort
of
bow
and
moved
to
the
door
farewell
whiggamore
the
girl
cried
keep
a
cheerful
countenance
or
they
think
you
a
your
breeches
will
mend
man
and
with
her
laughter
most
unpleasantly
in
my
ears
i
made
my
way
into
the
canongate
and
so
to
my
lodgings
at
macvittie
three
weeks
later
i
heard
that
muckle
john
was
destined
for
the
plantations
in
a
ship
of
barclay
of
urie
which
traded
to
new
jersey
i
had
a
fancy
to
see
him
before
he
went
and
after
much
trouble
i
was
suffered
to
visit
him
his
gaoler
told
me
he
had
been
mighty
wild
during
his
examination
before
the
council
and
had
had
frequent
bouts
of
madness
since
but
for
the
moment
he
was
peaceable
i
found
him
in
a
little
cell
by
himself
outside
the
common
room
of
the
gaol
he
was
sitting
in
an
attitude
of
great
dejection
and
when
i
entered
could
scarcely
recall
me
to
his
memory
i
remember
thinking
that
what
with
his
high
and
lank
black
hair
and
brooding
eyes
and
great
muscular
frame
scotland
could
scarcely
have
furnished
a
wilder
figure
for
the
admiration
of
the
carolinas
or
wherever
he
went
to
i
did
not
envy
his
future
master
but
with
me
he
was
very
friendly
and
quiet
his
ailment
was
for
though
he
had
been
a
great
voyager
it
seemed
he
was
loath
to
quit
our
bleak
countryside
for
ever
i
used
aye
to
think
the
first
sight
o
inchkeith
and
the
lomond
hills
and
the
smell
herrings
at
the
pier
o
leith
what
says
the
word
not
for
the
dead
neither
bemoan
him
but
weep
sore
for
him
that
goeth
away
for
he
shall
return
no
more
nor
see
his
native
i
asked
him
if
i
could
do
him
any
service
there
a
woman
at
cramond
he
began
timidly
she
might
like
to
ken
what
had
become
o
me
would
ye
carry
a
message
i
did
better
for
at
gib
dictation
i
composed
for
her
a
letter
since
he
could
not
write
i
wrote
it
on
some
blank
pages
from
my
pocket
which
i
used
for
college
notes
it
was
surely
the
queerest
ever
indited
for
the
most
part
of
it
was
theology
and
the
rest
was
instructions
for
the
disposing
of
his
scanty
plenishing
i
have
forgotten
now
what
i
wrote
but
i
remember
that
the
woman
name
was
alison
steel
chapter
iv
of
a
stairhead
and
a
with
the
escapade
that
landed
me
in
the
tolbooth
there
came
an
end
to
the
nightmare
years
of
my
first
youth
a
week
later
i
got
word
that
my
father
was
dead
of
an
ague
in
the
low
countries
and
i
had
to
be
off
to
auchencairn
to
see
to
the
ordering
of
our
little
estate
we
were
destined
to
be
bitter
poor
what
with
dues
and
regalities
incident
on
the
passing
of
the
ownership
and
i
thought
it
best
to
leave
my
mother
to
farm
it
with
the
help
of
robin
gilfillan
the
grieve
and
seek
employment
which
would
bring
me
an
honest
penny
her
one
brother
andrew
sempill
from
whom
i
was
named
was
a
merchant
in
glasgow
the
owner
of
three
ships
that
traded
to
the
western
seas
and
by
repute
a
man
of
a
shrewd
and
venturesome
temper
he
was
single
too
and
i
might
reasonably
look
to
be
his
heir
so
when
a
letter
came
from
him
offering
me
a
hand
in
his
business
my
mother
was
instant
for
my
going
i
was
little
loath
myself
for
i
saw
nothing
now
to
draw
me
to
the
profession
of
the
law
which
had
been
my
first
notion
hame
runs
the
proverb
as
the
devil
said
when
he
found
himself
in
the
court
of
session
and
i
had
lost
any
desire
for
that
sinister
company
besides
i
liked
the
notion
of
having
to
do
with
ships
and
far
lands
for
i
was
at
the
age
when
youth
burns
fiercely
in
a
lad
and
his
fancy
is
as
riotous
as
a
poet
yet
the
events
i
have
just
related
had
worked
a
change
in
my
life
they
had
driven
the
unthinking
child
out
of
me
and
forced
me
to
reflect
on
my
future
two
things
rankled
in
my
soul
a
wench
mocking
laughter
and
the
treatment
i
had
got
from
the
dragoon
it
was
not
that
i
was
in
love
with
the
girl
indeed
i
think
i
hated
her
but
i
could
not
get
her
face
out
of
my
head
or
her
voice
out
of
my
ears
she
had
mocked
me
treated
me
as
if
i
was
no
more
than
a
foolish
servant
and
my
vanity
was
raw
i
longed
to
beat
down
her
pride
to
make
her
creep
humbly
to
me
andrew
garvald
as
her
only
deliverer
and
how
that
should
be
compassed
was
the
subject
of
many
hot
fantasies
in
my
brain
the
dragoon
too
had
tossed
me
about
like
a
silly
sheep
and
my
manhood
cried
out
at
the
recollection
what
sort
of
man
was
i
if
any
lubberly
soldier
could
venture
on
such
liberties
i
went
into
the
business
with
the
monstrous
solemnity
of
youth
and
took
stock
of
my
equipment
as
if
i
were
casting
up
an
account
many
a
time
in
those
days
i
studied
my
appearance
in
the
glass
like
a
foolish
maid
i
was
not
well
featured
having
a
freckled
square
face
a
biggish
head
a
blunt
nose
grey
colourless
eyes
and
a
sandy
thatch
of
hair
i
had
great
square
shoulders
but
my
arms
were
too
short
for
my
stature
and
from
an
accident
in
my
nursing
days
of
indifferent
strength
all
this
stood
on
the
debit
side
of
my
account
on
the
credit
side
i
set
down
that
i
had
unshaken
good
health
and
an
uncommon
power
of
endurance
especially
in
the
legs
there
was
no
runner
in
the
upper
ward
of
lanark
who
was
my
match
and
i
had
travelled
the
hills
so
constantly
in
all
weathers
that
i
had
acquired
a
gipsy
lore
in
the
matter
of
beasts
and
birds
and
wild
things
i
had
long
clear
unerring
eyesight
which
had
often
stood
me
in
good
stead
in
the
time
of
my
father
troubles
of
moral
qualities
heaven
forgive
me
i
fear
i
thought
less
but
i
believed
though
i
had
been
little
proved
that
i
was
as
courageous
as
the
common
run
of
men
all
this
looks
babyish
in
the
writing
but
there
was
a
method
in
this
i
believed
that
i
was
fated
to
engage
in
strange
ventures
and
i
wanted
to
equip
myself
for
the
future
the
pressing
business
was
that
of
and
i
turned
first
to
a
proper
weapon
the
sword
here
alas
i
was
doomed
to
a
bitter
disappointment
my
father
had
given
me
a
lesson
now
and
then
but
never
enough
to
test
me
and
when
i
came
into
the
hands
of
a
glasgow
master
my
unfitness
was
soon
manifest
neither
with
broadsword
nor
small
sword
could
i
acquire
any
skill
my
short
arm
lacked
reach
and
vigour
and
there
seemed
to
be
some
stiffness
in
wrist
and
elbow
and
shoulder
which
compelled
me
to
yield
to
smaller
men
here
was
a
pretty
business
for
though
gentleman
born
i
was
as
loutish
with
a
gentleman
weapon
as
any
country
hind
this
discovery
gave
me
some
melancholy
weeks
but
i
plucked
up
heart
and
set
to
reasoning
if
my
hand
were
to
guard
my
head
it
must
find
some
other
way
of
it
my
thoughts
turned
to
powder
and
shot
to
the
musket
and
the
pistol
here
was
a
weapon
which
needed
only
a
stout
nerve
a
good
eye
and
a
steady
hand
one
of
these
i
possessed
to
the
full
and
the
others
were
not
beyond
my
attainment
there
lived
an
armourer
in
the
gallowgate
one
weir
with
whom
i
began
to
spend
my
leisure
there
was
an
alley
by
the
molendinar
burn
close
to
the
archery
butts
where
he
would
let
me
practise
at
a
mark
with
guns
from
his
store
soon
to
my
delight
i
found
that
here
was
a
weapon
with
which
i
need
fear
few
rivals
i
had
a
natural
genius
for
the
thing
as
some
men
have
for
and
weir
was
a
zealous
teacher
for
he
loved
his
see
andrew
he
would
cry
this
is
the
true
leveller
of
mankind
it
will
make
the
man
his
master
equal
for
though
your
gentleman
may
cock
on
a
horse
and
wave
his
andrew
ferrara
this
will
bring
him
off
it
brains
my
lad
will
tell
in
coming
days
for
it
takes
a
head
to
shoot
well
though
any
flesher
may
swing
a
sword
the
better
marksman
i
grew
the
less
i
liked
the
common
make
of
guns
and
i
cast
about
to
work
an
improvement
i
was
especially
fond
of
the
short
gun
or
pistol
not
the
thing
which
shot
a
handful
of
slugs
and
was
as
little
precise
in
its
aim
as
a
hailstorm
but
the
light
foreign
pistol
which
shot
as
true
as
a
musket
weir
had
learned
his
trade
in
italy
and
was
a
neat
craftsman
so
i
employed
him
to
make
me
a
pistol
after
my
own
pattern
the
butt
was
of
light
tough
wood
and
for
i
did
not
care
to
waste
money
on
ornament
the
barrel
was
shorter
than
the
usual
and
of
the
best
spanish
metal
and
the
pan
and
the
lock
were
set
after
my
own
device
nor
was
that
all
for
i
became
an
epicure
in
the
matter
of
bullets
and
made
my
own
with
the
care
of
a
goldsmith
i
would
weigh
out
the
powder
charges
as
nicely
as
an
apothecary
weighs
his
drugs
for
i
had
discovered
that
with
the
pistol
the
weight
of
bullet
and
charge
meant
much
for
good
marksmanship
from
weir
i
got
the
notion
of
putting
up
ball
and
powder
in
cartouches
and
i
devised
a
method
of
priming
much
quicker
and
surer
than
the
ordinary
in
one
way
and
another
i
believe
i
acquired
more
skill
in
the
business
than
anybody
then
living
in
scotland
i
cherished
my
toy
like
a
lover
i
christened
it
elspeth
it
lay
by
my
bed
at
night
and
lived
by
day
in
a
box
of
foreign
wood
given
me
by
one
of
my
uncle
skippers
i
doubt
i
thought
more
of
it
than
of
my
duty
to
my
maker
all
the
time
i
was
very
busy
at
uncle
andrew
in
the
candleriggs
and
down
by
the
among
the
sailors
it
was
the
day
when
glasgow
was
rising
from
a
cluster
of
streets
round
the
high
kirk
and
college
to
be
the
chief
merchants
resort
in
scotland
standing
near
the
western
seas
she
turned
her
eyes
naturally
to
the
americas
and
a
great
trade
was
beginning
in
tobacco
and
raw
silk
from
virginia
rich
woods
and
dye
stuffs
from
the
main
and
rice
and
fruits
from
the
summer
islands
the
river
was
too
shallow
for
ships
of
heavy
burthen
so
it
was
the
custom
to
unload
in
the
neighbourhood
of
greenock
and
bring
the
goods
upstream
in
barges
to
the
quay
at
the
broomielaw
there
my
uncle
in
company
with
other
merchants
had
his
warehouse
but
his
was
up
in
the
town
near
by
the
college
and
i
spent
my
time
equally
between
the
two
places
i
became
furiously
interested
in
the
work
for
it
has
ever
been
my
happy
fortune
to
be
intent
on
whatever
i
might
be
doing
at
the
moment
i
think
i
served
my
uncle
well
for
i
had
much
of
the
merchant
aptitude
and
the
eye
to
discern
profits
he
liked
my
boldness
for
i
was
impatient
of
the
ways
of
some
of
our
we
are
dealing
with
new
lands
i
would
say
and
there
is
need
of
new
plans
it
pays
to
think
in
trading
as
much
as
in
statecraft
there
were
plenty
that
looked
askance
at
us
and
cursed
us
as
troublers
of
the
peace
and
there
were
some
who
prophesied
speedy
ruin
but
we
discomforted
our
neighbours
by
prospering
mightily
so
that
there
was
talk
of
uncle
andrew
for
the
provost
chair
at
the
next
vacancy
they
were
happy
years
the
four
i
spent
in
glasgow
for
i
was
young
and
ardent
and
had
not
yet
suffered
the
grave
miscarriage
of
hope
which
is
our
human
lot
my
uncle
was
a
busy
merchant
but
he
was
also
something
of
a
scholar
and
was
never
happier
than
when
disputing
some
learned
point
with
a
college
professor
over
a
bowl
of
punch
he
was
a
great
fisherman
too
and
many
a
salmon
i
have
seen
him
kill
between
the
town
and
rutherglen
in
the
autumn
afternoons
he
treated
me
like
a
son
and
by
his
aid
i
completed
my
education
by
much
reading
of
books
and
a
frequent
attendance
at
college
lectures
such
leisure
as
i
had
i
spent
by
the
talking
with
the
ship
captains
and
getting
news
of
far
lands
in
this
way
i
learned
something
of
the
handling
of
a
ship
and
especially
how
to
sail
a
sloop
alone
in
rough
weather
i
have
ventured
myself
the
only
crew
far
down
the
river
to
the
beginning
of
the
sealocks
and
more
than
once
escaped
drowning
by
a
miracle
of
a
saturday
i
would
sometimes
ride
out
to
auchencairn
to
see
my
mother
and
assist
with
my
advice
the
work
of
robin
gilfillan
once
i
remember
i
rode
to
carnwath
and
looked
again
on
the
bleak
house
where
the
girl
elspeth
had
sung
to
me
in
the
rain
i
found
it
locked
and
deserted
and
heard
from
a
countrywoman
that
the
folk
had
gone
and
a
guid
riddance
said
the
woman
the
blairs
was
aye
a
cauld
and
oppressive
race
and
they
were
black
prelatists
forbye
but
i
whiles
miss
yon
hellicat
lassie
she
had
a
cheery
word
for
and
she
keepit
the
place
frae
languor
but
i
can
not
linger
over
the
tale
of
those
peaceful
years
when
i
have
so
much
that
is
strange
and
stirring
to
set
down
presently
came
the
revolution
when
king
james
fled
overseas
and
the
dutch
king
william
reigned
in
his
stead
the
event
was
a
godsend
to
our
trade
for
with
scotland
in
a
bicker
with
covenants
and
dragoonings
and
new
taxes
threatened
with
each
new
parliament
a
merchant
credit
was
apt
to
be
a
brittle
thing
the
change
brought
a
measure
of
security
and
as
we
prospered
i
soon
began
to
see
that
something
must
be
done
in
our
virginian
trade
years
before
my
uncle
had
sent
out
a
man
lambie
by
name
who
watched
his
interests
in
that
country
but
we
had
to
face
such
fierce
rivalry
from
the
bristol
merchants
that
i
had
small
confidence
in
lambie
who
from
his
letters
was
a
sleepy
soul
i
broached
the
matter
to
my
uncle
and
offered
to
go
myself
and
put
things
in
order
at
first
he
was
unwilling
to
listen
i
think
he
was
sorry
to
part
with
me
for
we
had
become
close
friends
and
there
was
also
the
difficulty
of
my
mother
to
whom
i
was
the
natural
protector
but
his
opposition
died
down
when
i
won
my
mother
to
my
side
and
when
i
promised
that
i
would
duly
return
i
pointed
out
that
glasgow
and
virginia
were
not
so
far
apart
planters
from
the
colony
would
dwell
with
us
for
a
season
and
their
sons
often
come
to
glasgow
for
their
schooling
you
could
see
the
proud
fellows
walking
the
streets
in
brave
clothes
and
marching
into
the
kirk
on
sabbath
with
a
couple
of
servants
carrying
cushions
and
bibles
in
the
better
class
of
tavern
one
could
always
meet
with
a
virginian
or
two
compounding
their
curious
drinks
and
swearing
their
outlandish
oaths
most
of
them
had
gone
afield
from
scotland
and
it
was
a
fine
incentive
to
us
young
men
to
see
how
mightily
they
had
prospered
my
uncle
yielded
and
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
sail
with
the
first
convoy
of
the
new
year
from
the
moment
of
the
decision
i
walked
the
earth
in
a
delirium
of
expectation
that
february
i
remember
was
blue
and
mild
with
soft
airs
blowing
up
the
river
down
by
the
broomielaw
i
found
a
new
rapture
in
the
smell
of
tar
and
cordage
and
the
queer
foreign
scents
in
my
uncle
warehouse
every
skipper
and
greasy
sailor
became
for
me
a
figure
of
romance
i
scanned
every
outland
face
wondering
if
i
should
meet
it
again
in
the
new
world
a
negro
in
cotton
drawers
shivering
in
our
northern
dune
had
more
attraction
for
me
than
the
fairest
maid
and
i
was
eager
to
speak
with
all
and
every
one
who
had
crossed
the
ocean
one
bronzed
mariner
with
silver
earrings
i
entertained
to
three
stoups
of
usquebaugh
hoping
for
strange
tales
but
the
little
i
had
from
him
before
he
grew
drunk
was
that
he
had
once
voyaged
to
the
canaries
you
may
imagine
that
i
kept
my
fancies
to
myself
and
was
outwardly
only
the
sober
merchant
with
a
mind
set
on
freights
and
hogsheads
but
whoever
remembers
his
youth
will
know
that
such
terms
to
me
were
not
the
common
parlance
of
trade
the
very
names
of
the
tobaccos
negro
head
oronoke
carolina
red
gloucester
glory
golden
rod
sang
in
my
head
like
a
tune
that
told
of
green
forests
and
magic
islands
but
an
incident
befell
ere
i
left
which
was
to
have
unforeseen
effects
on
my
future
one
afternoon
i
was
in
the
shooting
alley
i
have
spoken
of
making
trial
of
a
new
size
of
bullet
i
had
moulded
the
place
was
just
behind
parlane
tavern
and
some
gentlemen
who
had
been
drinking
there
came
out
to
cool
their
heads
and
see
the
sport
most
of
them
were
from
the
lennox
and
after
the
highland
fashion
had
in
their
belts
heavy
pistols
of
the
old
kind
which
folk
called
dags
they
were
cumbrous
things
gaudily
ornamented
with
silver
and
damascus
work
fit
ornaments
for
a
savage
highland
chief
but
little
good
for
serious
business
unless
a
man
were
only
a
pace
or
two
from
his
opponent
one
of
them
who
had
drunk
less
than
the
others
came
up
to
me
and
very
civilly
proposed
a
match
i
was
nothing
loath
so
a
course
was
fixed
and
a
mutchkin
of
french
de
named
as
the
prize
i
borrowed
an
old
hat
from
the
landlord
which
had
stuck
in
its
side
a
small
red
cockade
the
thing
was
hung
as
a
target
in
a
leafless
cherry
tree
at
twenty
paces
and
the
cockade
was
to
be
the
centre
mark
each
man
was
to
fire
three
shots
apiece
barshalloch
for
so
his
companions
called
my
opponent
after
his
lairdship
made
a
great
about
the
loading
and
would
not
be
content
till
he
had
drawn
the
charge
two
three
times
the
spin
of
a
coin
gave
him
first
shot
and
he
missed
the
mark
and
cut
the
bole
of
the
tree
see
i
said
i
will
put
my
ball
within
a
of
his
sure
enough
when
they
looked
the
two
bullets
were
all
but
in
the
same
hole
his
second
shot
took
the
hat
low
down
on
its
right
side
and
clipped
away
a
bit
of
the
brim
i
saw
by
this
time
that
the
man
could
shoot
though
he
had
a
poor
weapon
and
understood
little
about
it
so
i
told
the
company
that
i
would
trim
the
hat
by
slicing
a
bit
from
the
other
side
this
i
achieved
though
by
little
for
my
shot
removed
only
half
as
much
cloth
as
its
predecessor
but
the
performance
amazed
the
onlookers
ye
found
a
fair
provost
at
the
job
barshalloch
one
of
them
hiccupped
better
quit
and
pay
for
the
mutchkin
my
antagonist
took
every
care
with
his
last
shot
and
just
missing
the
cockade
hit
the
hat
about
the
middle
cut
the
branch
on
which
it
rested
and
brought
it
fluttering
to
the
ground
a
pace
or
two
farther
on
it
lay
there
dimly
seen
through
a
low
branch
of
the
cherry
tree
with
the
cockade
on
the
side
nearest
me
it
was
a
difficult
mark
but
the
light
was
good
and
my
hand
steady
i
walked
forward
and
brought
back
the
hat
with
a
hole
drilled
clean
through
the
cockade
at
that
there
was
a
great
laughter
and
much
jocosity
from
the
at
their
friend
expense
barshalloch
very
handsomely
complimented
me
and
sent
for
the
mutchkin
his
words
made
me
warm
towards
him
and
i
told
him
that
half
the
business
was
not
my
skill
of
shooting
but
the
weapon
i
carried
he
begged
for
a
look
at
it
and
examined
it
long
and
carefully
will
ye
sell
friend
he
asked
i
give
ye
ten
golden
guineas
and
the
best
filly
that
ever
came
out
o
strathendrick
for
that
pistol
but
i
told
him
that
the
offer
of
strathendrick
itself
would
not
buy
it
no
said
he
well
i
wo
say
ye
wrong
a
man
should
cherish
his
weapon
like
his
wife
for
it
carries
his
honour
presently
having
drunk
the
wager
they
went
indoors
again
all
but
a
tall
fellow
who
had
been
a
but
had
not
been
of
the
lennox
company
i
had
remarked
him
during
the
contest
a
long
lean
man
with
a
bright
humorous
blue
eye
and
a
fiery
red
head
he
was
maybe
ten
years
older
than
me
and
though
he
was
finely
dressed
in
town
clothes
there
was
about
his
whole
appearance
a
smack
of
the
sea
he
came
forward
and
in
a
very
highland
voice
asked
my
name
why
should
i
tell
you
i
said
a
little
nettled
just
that
i
might
carry
it
in
my
head
i
have
seen
some
pretty
shooting
in
my
day
but
none
like
yours
young
one
what
your
trade
that
ye
learned
the
pistol
game
so
cleverly
now
i
was
flushed
with
pride
and
in
no
mood
for
a
patronage
so
i
told
him
roundly
that
it
was
none
of
his
business
and
pushed
by
him
to
parlane
but
my
brusqueness
gave
no
offence
to
this
odd
being
he
only
laughed
and
cried
after
me
that
if
my
manners
were
the
equal
of
my
marksmanship
i
would
be
the
best
lad
he
had
seen
since
his
i
had
dinner
with
my
uncle
in
the
candleriggs
and
sat
with
him
late
afterwards
casting
up
accounts
so
it
was
not
till
nine
that
i
set
out
on
my
way
to
my
lodgings
these
were
in
the
saltmarket
close
on
the
river
front
and
to
reach
them
i
went
by
the
short
road
through
the
friar
vennel
it
was
an
quarter
of
the
town
and
not
long
before
had
been
noted
as
a
haunt
of
coiners
but
i
had
gone
through
it
often
and
met
with
no
hindrance
in
the
vennel
stood
a
tall
dark
bit
of
masonry
called
lordship
which
was
pierced
by
long
closes
from
which
twisting
stairways
led
to
the
upper
landings
i
was
noting
its
gloomy
aspect
under
the
dim
february
moon
when
a
man
came
towards
me
and
turned
into
one
of
the
closes
he
swung
along
with
a
free
careless
gait
that
marked
him
as
no
townsman
and
ere
he
plunged
into
the
darkness
i
had
a
glimpse
of
fiery
hair
it
was
the
stranger
who
had
accosted
me
in
parlane
alley
and
he
was
either
drunk
or
in
wild
spirits
for
he
was
singing
we
a
dry
wi
the
drinkin
we
a
dry
wi
the
drinkin
the
minister
kissed
the
fiddler
wife
and
he
couldna
preach
for
thinkin
the
ribald
chorus
echoed
from
the
close
mouth
then
i
saw
that
he
was
followed
by
three
others
bent
slinking
fellows
who
slipped
across
the
patches
of
moonlight
and
eagerly
scanned
the
empty
vennel
they
could
not
see
me
for
i
was
in
shadow
and
presently
they
too
entered
the
close
the
thing
looked
ugly
and
while
i
had
no
love
for
the
man
i
did
not
wish
to
see
murder
or
robbery
committed
and
stand
idly
by
the
match
of
the
afternoon
had
given
me
a
fine
notion
of
my
prowess
though
had
i
reflected
my
pistol
was
in
its
case
at
home
and
i
had
no
weapon
but
a
hazel
staff
happily
in
youth
the
blood
is
quicker
than
the
brain
and
without
a
thought
i
ran
into
the
close
and
up
the
long
stairway
the
chorus
was
still
being
sung
ahead
of
me
and
then
it
suddenly
ceased
in
dead
silence
and
in
pitchy
darkness
i
struggled
up
the
stone
steps
wondering
what
i
should
find
at
the
next
turning
the
place
was
black
as
night
the
steps
were
uneven
and
the
stairs
corkscrewed
most
wonderfully
i
wished
with
all
my
heart
that
i
had
not
come
as
i
groped
upwards
hugging
the
wall
then
a
cry
came
and
a
noise
of
hard
breathing
at
the
same
moment
a
door
opened
somewhere
above
my
head
and
a
faint
glow
came
down
the
stairs
presently
with
a
great
rumble
a
heavy
man
came
rolling
past
me
butting
with
his
head
at
the
he
came
to
anchor
on
a
landing
below
me
and
finding
his
feet
plunged
downwards
as
if
the
devil
were
at
his
heels
he
left
behind
him
a
short
highland
knife
which
i
picked
up
and
put
in
my
pocket
on
his
heels
came
another
with
his
hand
clapped
to
his
side
and
he
moaned
as
he
slithered
past
me
something
dripped
from
him
on
the
stone
steps
the
light
grew
stronger
and
as
i
rounded
the
last
turning
a
third
came
bounding
down
stumbling
from
wall
to
wall
like
a
drunk
man
i
saw
his
face
clearly
and
if
ever
mortal
eyes
held
baffled
murder
it
was
that
fellow
there
was
a
dark
mark
on
his
shoulder
above
me
as
i
blinked
stood
my
friend
on
the
top
landing
he
had
his
sword
drawn
and
was
whistling
softly
through
his
teeth
while
on
the
right
hand
was
an
open
door
and
an
old
man
holding
a
lamp
ho
he
cried
here
comes
a
fourth
god
help
it
my
friend
the
marksman
i
did
not
like
that
naked
bit
of
steel
but
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
see
the
thing
through
when
he
saw
that
i
was
unarmed
he
returned
his
weapon
to
its
sheath
and
smiled
broadly
down
on
me
what
brings
my
proud
gentleman
up
these
long
stairs
he
asked
i
saw
you
entering
the
close
and
three
men
following
you
it
looked
bad
so
i
came
up
to
see
fair
play
did
ye
so
and
a
very
pretty
intention
but
ye
needna
have
fashed
yourself
did
ye
see
any
of
our
friends
on
the
stairs
i
met
a
big
man
rolling
down
like
a
football
i
said
ay
that
would
be
angus
he
a
clumsy
stot
and
never
had
much
sense
and
i
met
another
with
his
hand
on
his
side
i
said
that
would
be
little
james
he
a
fine
lad
with
a
on
a
dark
night
but
there
was
maybe
too
much
light
here
for
his
trade
and
i
met
a
third
who
reeled
like
a
drunk
man
i
said
ay
said
he
meditatively
that
was
long
colin
he
the
flower
the
flock
and
i
had
to
pink
him
at
another
time
and
in
a
better
place
i
would
have
liked
a
bout
with
him
for
he
has
some
notion
of
who
were
the
men
i
asked
in
much
confusion
for
this
laughing
warrior
perplexed
me
who
but
just
my
cousins
from
glengyle
there
has
long
been
a
sort
of
bicker
between
us
and
they
thought
they
had
got
a
fine
chance
of
ending
it
and
who
in
heaven
name
are
you
i
said
that
treats
murder
so
lightly
me
he
repeated
well
i
might
give
ye
the
answer
you
gave
me
this
very
day
when
i
speired
the
same
question
but
i
am
frank
by
nature
and
i
see
you
wish
me
well
come
in
bye
and
we
discuss
the
matter
he
led
me
into
a
room
where
a
cheerful
fire
crackled
and
got
out
from
a
press
a
bottle
and
glasses
he
produced
tobacco
from
a
brass
box
and
filled
a
long
pipe
now
said
he
we
understand
each
other
better
ye
see
before
you
a
poor
gentleman
of
fortune
whom
poverty
and
a
roving
spirit
have
driven
to
outland
bits
o
the
earth
to
ply
his
lawful
trade
of
they
call
me
by
different
names
i
have
passed
for
a
dutch
skipper
and
a
maryland
planter
and
a
french
trader
and
in
spite
of
my
colour
i
have
been
a
spanish
don
in
the
main
at
tortuga
you
will
hear
one
name
and
another
at
port
o
spain
and
a
third
at
cartagena
but
seeing
we
are
in
the
city
o
glasgow
in
the
kindly
kingdom
scotland
i
be
honest
with
you
my
father
called
me
ninian
campbell
and
there
no
better
blood
in
breadalbane
what
could
i
do
after
that
but
make
him
a
present
of
the
trivial
facts
about
myself
and
my
doings
there
was
a
look
of
friendly
humour
about
this
which
captured
my
fancy
i
saw
in
him
the
stuff
of
which
adventurers
are
made
and
though
i
was
a
sober
merchant
i
was
also
young
for
days
i
had
been
dreaming
of
foreign
parts
and
an
odyssey
of
strange
fortunes
and
here
on
a
glasgow
stairhead
i
had
found
ulysses
himself
is
it
not
the
pity
he
cried
that
such
talents
as
yours
should
rust
in
a
dark
room
in
the
candleriggs
believe
me
garvald
i
have
seen
some
pretty
shots
but
i
have
never
seen
your
better
then
i
told
him
that
i
was
sailing
within
a
month
for
virginia
and
he
suddenly
grew
solemn
it
looks
like
providence
he
said
that
we
two
should
come
together
i
too
will
soon
be
back
in
the
western
seas
and
belike
we
meet
i
something
of
a
rover
and
i
never
bide
long
in
the
same
place
but
i
whiles
pay
a
visit
to
james
town
and
they
ken
me
well
on
the
eastern
shore
and
the
accomac
beaches
he
fell
to
giving
me
such
advice
as
a
traveller
gives
to
a
novice
it
was
strange
hearing
for
an
honest
merchant
for
much
of
it
was
concerned
with
divers
ways
of
outwitting
the
law
by
and
by
he
was
determined
to
convoy
me
to
my
lodgings
for
he
pointed
out
that
i
was
unarmed
and
i
think
too
he
had
still
hopes
of
another
meeting
with
long
colin
his
cousin
i
leave
glasgow
the
morrow
morn
he
said
and
it
no
likely
meet
again
in
scotland
out
in
virginia
no
doubt
you
soon
be
a
great
man
and
sit
in
council
and
with
the
governor
but
a
midge
can
help
an
elephant
and
i
would
gladly
help
you
for
you
had
the
goodwill
to
help
me
if
ye
need
aid
you
will
go
to
mercer
tavern
at
james
town
down
on
the
water
front
and
you
will
ask
news
of
ninian
campbell
the
man
will
say
that
he
never
heard
tell
of
the
name
and
then
you
will
speak
these
words
to
him
you
will
say
lymphads
are
on
the
loch
and
the
horn
of
diarmaid
has
sounded
keep
them
well
in
mind
for
some
way
or
other
they
will
bring
you
and
me
together
without
another
word
he
was
off
and
as
i
committed
the
gibberish
to
memory
i
could
hear
his
song
going
up
the
saltmarket
the
minister
kissed
the
fiddler
wife
and
he
couldna
preach
for
thinkin
chapter
my
first
coming
to
virginia
there
are
few
moments
in
life
to
compare
with
a
traveller
first
sight
of
a
new
land
which
is
destined
to
be
for
short
or
long
his
home
when
after
a
fair
and
speedy
voyage
we
passed
point
comfort
and
had
rid
ourselves
of
the
revenue
men
and
the
tides
bore
us
up
the
estuary
of
a
noble
river
i
stood
on
deck
and
drank
in
the
heady
foreign
scents
with
a
boyish
ecstasy
presently
we
had
opened
the
capital
city
which
seemed
to
me
no
more
than
a
village
set
amid
gardens
and
lambie
had
come
aboard
and
greeted
me
he
conveyed
me
to
the
best
ordinary
in
the
town
which
stood
over
against
the
late
in
the
afternoon
just
before
the
dark
fell
i
walked
out
to
drink
my
fill
of
the
place
you
are
to
remember
that
i
was
a
country
lad
who
had
never
set
foot
forth
of
scotland
i
was
very
young
and
hot
on
the
quest
of
new
sights
and
doings
as
i
walked
down
the
unpaven
street
and
through
the
narrow
lanes
the
strange
smell
of
it
all
intoxicated
me
like
wine
there
was
a
great
red
sunset
burning
over
the
blue
river
and
kindling
the
far
forests
till
they
glowed
like
jewels
the
frogs
were
croaking
among
the
reeds
and
the
wild
duck
squattered
in
the
dusk
i
passed
an
indian
the
first
i
had
seen
with
cock
feathers
on
his
head
and
a
curiously
tattooed
chest
moving
as
light
as
a
one
or
two
townsfolk
took
the
air
smoking
their
long
pipes
and
down
by
the
water
a
negro
girl
was
singing
a
wild
melody
the
whole
place
was
like
a
mad
dream
to
one
just
come
from
the
unfeatured
ocean
and
with
a
memory
only
of
grim
scots
cities
and
dour
scots
hills
i
felt
as
if
i
had
come
into
a
large
and
generous
land
and
i
thanked
god
that
i
was
but
but
as
i
was
mooning
along
there
came
a
sudden
interruption
on
my
dreams
i
was
beyond
the
houses
in
a
path
which
ran
among
and
little
gardens
with
the
river
lapping
a
off
down
a
side
alley
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
figure
that
seemed
familiar
was
that
of
a
tall
hulking
man
moving
quickly
among
the
tobacco
plants
with
something
stealthy
in
his
air
the
broad
bowed
shoulders
and
the
lean
head
brought
back
to
me
the
rainy
moorlands
about
the
cauldstaneslap
and
the
mad
fellow
whose
prison
i
had
shared
muckle
john
had
gone
to
the
plantations
and
was
muckle
john
or
the
devil
that
was
moving
there
in
the
half
light
i
cried
on
him
and
ran
down
the
side
alley
but
it
seemed
that
he
did
not
want
company
for
he
broke
into
a
run
now
in
those
days
i
rejoiced
in
the
strength
of
my
legs
and
i
was
determined
not
to
be
thus
balked
so
i
doubled
after
him
into
a
maze
of
tobacco
and
melon
beds
but
it
seemed
he
knew
how
to
run
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
hairy
legs
round
the
corner
of
a
shed
and
then
lost
him
in
a
patch
of
cane
then
i
came
out
on
a
sort
of
causeway
floored
with
boards
which
covered
a
marshy
sluice
and
there
i
made
great
strides
on
him
he
was
clear
against
the
sky
now
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
clad
only
in
shirt
and
cotton
breeches
while
at
his
waist
flapped
an
ugly
rounding
the
hut
corner
i
ran
full
into
a
man
hold
you
cried
the
stranger
and
laid
hands
on
my
arm
but
i
shook
him
off
violently
and
continued
the
race
the
collision
had
cracked
my
temper
and
i
had
a
mind
to
give
muckle
john
a
lesson
in
civility
for
muckle
john
it
was
beyond
doubt
not
two
men
in
the
broad
earth
had
that
ungainly
bend
of
neck
the
next
i
knew
we
were
out
on
the
river
bank
on
a
shore
of
hard
clay
which
the
tides
had
created
here
i
saw
him
more
clearly
and
i
began
to
doubt
i
might
be
chasing
some
ruffian
who
would
give
me
a
knife
in
my
belly
for
my
pains
the
doubt
slackened
my
pace
and
he
gained
on
me
then
i
saw
his
intention
there
was
a
wherry
tied
up
by
the
bank
and
for
this
he
made
he
flung
off
the
rope
seized
a
long
pole
and
began
to
push
away
the
last
rays
of
the
westering
sun
fell
on
his
face
and
my
hesitation
vanished
for
those
brows
and
eyes
were
fixed
for
ever
in
my
memory
i
cried
to
him
as
i
ran
but
he
never
looked
my
road
somehow
it
was
borne
in
on
me
that
at
all
costs
i
must
have
speech
with
him
the
wherry
was
a
yard
or
two
from
the
shore
when
i
jumped
for
its
stern
i
lighted
firm
on
the
wood
and
for
a
moment
looked
muckle
john
in
the
face
i
saw
a
countenance
lean
like
a
starved
wolf
with
great
weals
as
of
old
wounds
on
cheek
and
brow
but
only
for
a
second
for
as
i
balanced
myself
to
step
forward
he
rammed
the
butt
of
the
pole
in
my
chest
so
that
i
staggered
and
fell
plump
in
the
river
the
water
was
only
up
to
my
middle
but
before
i
could
clamber
back
he
had
shipped
his
oars
and
was
well
into
the
centre
of
the
stream
i
stood
staring
like
a
zany
while
black
anger
filled
my
heart
i
plucked
my
pistol
forth
and
for
a
second
was
on
the
verge
of
murder
for
i
could
have
shot
him
like
a
rabbit
but
god
mercifully
restrained
my
foolish
passion
and
presently
the
boat
and
the
rower
vanished
in
the
evening
haze
this
is
a
bonny
beginning
thought
i
as
i
waded
through
the
mud
to
the
shore
i
was
wearing
my
best
clothes
in
honour
of
my
arrival
and
they
were
all
fouled
and
plashing
then
on
the
bank
above
me
i
saw
the
fellow
who
had
run
into
me
and
hindered
my
catching
muckle
john
on
dry
land
he
was
shaking
with
laughter
i
was
silly
and
in
those
days
and
my
wetting
had
not
disposed
me
to
be
laughed
at
in
this
fellow
i
saw
a
confederate
of
gib
and
if
i
had
lost
one
i
had
the
other
so
i
marched
up
to
him
and
very
roundly
damned
his
insolence
he
was
a
stern
man
of
forty
or
so
dressed
very
roughly
in
leather
breeches
and
a
frieze
coat
long
grey
woollen
stockings
were
rolled
above
his
knees
and
slung
on
his
back
was
an
ancient
musket
easy
my
lad
he
said
it
a
free
country
and
there
no
statute
against
mirth
i
have
you
before
the
sheriff
i
cried
you
tripped
me
up
when
i
was
on
the
track
of
the
biggest
rogue
in
america
so
said
he
mocking
me
you
be
a
good
judge
of
rogues
was
it
a
runaway
redemptioner
maybe
you
be
looking
for
the
twenty
hogsheads
reward
this
was
more
than
i
could
stand
i
was
carrying
a
pistol
in
my
hand
and
i
stuck
it
to
his
ear
march
my
friend
i
said
you
walk
before
me
to
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
explain
your
doings
this
night
i
had
never
threatened
a
man
with
a
deadly
weapon
before
and
i
was
to
learn
a
most
unforgettable
lesson
a
hand
shot
out
caught
my
wrist
and
forced
it
upwards
in
a
grip
of
steel
and
when
i
would
have
used
my
right
fist
in
his
face
another
hand
seized
that
and
my
arms
were
padlocked
cool
ironical
eyes
looked
into
mine
you
very
free
with
your
little
gun
my
lad
let
me
give
you
a
word
in
season
never
hold
a
pistol
to
a
man
unless
you
mean
to
shoot
if
your
eyes
waver
you
had
better
had
a
porridge
stick
he
pressed
my
wrist
back
till
my
fingers
relaxed
and
he
caught
my
pistol
in
his
teeth
with
a
quick
movement
of
the
head
he
dropped
it
inside
his
shirt
there
some
would
have
killed
you
for
that
trick
young
sir
he
said
it
trying
to
the
temper
to
have
gunpowder
so
near
a
brain
but
you
young
and
by
your
speech
a
so
instead
i
offer
you
a
drink
he
dropped
my
wrists
and
motioned
me
to
follow
him
very
crestfallen
and
ashamed
i
walked
in
his
wake
to
a
little
shanty
almost
on
the
wateredge
the
place
was
some
kind
of
inn
for
a
negro
brought
us
two
tankards
of
and
tobacco
pipes
and
lit
a
lantern
which
he
set
between
us
first
says
the
man
let
me
tell
you
that
i
never
before
clapped
eyes
on
the
long
piece
of
rascality
you
were
seeking
he
looked
like
one
that
had
cheated
the
gallows
he
was
a
man
i
knew
in
scotland
i
said
grumpily
likely
enough
there
a
heap
of
scots
redemptioners
hereaways
out
of
scotland
myself
or
my
forbears
were
but
my
father
was
settled
in
the
antrim
glens
there
wild
devils
among
them
and
your
friend
looked
as
if
he
had
given
the
slip
to
the
hounds
in
the
marshes
there
was
little
left
of
his
breeches
drink
man
or
you
get
fever
from
your
wet
duds
i
drank
and
the
strong
stuff
mounted
to
my
unaccustomed
brain
my
tongue
was
loosened
my
mellowed
and
i
found
myself
telling
this
grim
fellow
much
that
was
in
my
heart
so
you
a
merchant
he
said
it
not
for
me
to
call
down
an
honest
trade
but
we
could
be
doing
with
fewer
merchants
in
these
parts
they
so
many
leeches
that
suck
our
blood
are
you
here
to
make
siller
i
said
i
was
and
he
laughed
i
never
heard
of
your
uncle
business
garvald
but
you
find
it
a
stiff
task
to
compete
with
the
lads
from
bristol
and
london
they
got
the
whole
dominion
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
i
replied
that
i
was
not
in
awe
of
them
and
that
i
could
hold
my
own
with
anybody
in
a
fair
trade
fair
trade
he
cried
scornfully
that
just
what
you
wo
get
that
a
thing
unkenned
in
virginia
look
you
here
my
lad
the
parliament
in
london
treats
us
virginians
like
so
many
puling
bairns
we
can
not
sell
our
tobacco
except
to
english
merchants
and
we
can
not
buy
a
horn
spoon
except
it
comes
in
an
english
ship
what
the
result
of
that
you
as
a
merchant
can
tell
me
fine
the
english
fix
what
price
they
like
for
our
goods
and
it
the
lowest
conceivable
and
they
make
their
own
price
for
what
they
sell
us
and
that
as
high
as
a
jew
there
a
fine
profit
there
for
the
of
bristol
but
it
starvation
and
damnation
for
us
poor
virginians
what
the
result
he
cried
again
why
that
there
nothing
to
be
had
in
the
land
except
what
the
merchants
bring
there
scarcely
a
smith
or
a
wright
or
a
cobbler
between
the
james
and
the
potomac
if
i
want
a
bed
to
lie
in
i
have
to
wait
till
the
coming
of
the
tobacco
convoy
and
go
down
to
the
wharves
and
pay
a
hundred
pounds
of
for
a
thing
you
would
buy
in
the
candleriggs
for
twenty
shillings
how
in
god
name
is
a
farmer
to
live
if
he
has
to
pay
usury
for
every
plough
and
spade
and
yard
of
dimity
remember
you
speaking
to
a
merchant
i
said
you
told
me
the
very
thing
to
encourage
me
if
prices
are
high
it
all
the
better
for
me
it
would
be
he
said
grimly
if
your
name
werena
what
it
is
and
you
came
from
elsewhere
than
the
clyde
think
the
proud
english
corporations
are
going
to
let
you
inside
not
them
the
most
you
get
will
be
the
scraps
that
fall
from
their
table
my
poor
lazarus
and
for
these
you
have
to
go
hat
in
hand
to
dives
his
face
grew
suddenly
earnest
and
he
leaned
on
the
table
and
looked
me
straight
in
the
eyes
you
a
young
lad
and
a
and
the
accursed
scales
of
virginia
are
not
yet
on
your
eyes
forbye
i
think
you
spirit
though
it
maybe
mixed
with
a
deal
of
folly
you
your
choice
before
you
garvald
you
can
become
a
lickspittle
like
the
rest
of
them
and
no
doubt
you
gather
a
wheen
bawbees
but
it
will
be
a
poor
shivering
soul
will
meet
its
maker
in
the
hinder
end
or
you
can
play
the
man
and
be
a
good
virginian
i
not
say
it
an
easy
part
find
plenty
to
cry
you
down
and
there
will
be
hard
knocks
going
but
by
your
face
i
judge
you
not
afraid
of
that
let
me
tell
you
this
land
is
on
the
edge
of
hell
and
there
sore
need
for
stout
men
they
declare
in
this
town
that
there
no
indians
on
this
side
the
mountains
that
would
dare
to
lift
a
tomahawk
little
they
ken
in
his
eagerness
he
had
gripped
my
arm
and
his
dark
lean
face
was
thrust
close
to
mine
i
was
with
bacon
in
in
the
fray
with
the
susquehannocks
i
speak
the
indian
tongues
and
there
few
alive
that
ken
the
tribes
like
me
the
folk
here
live
snug
in
the
tidewater
which
is
maybe
a
hundred
miles
wide
from
the
sea
but
of
the
west
they
ken
nothing
there
might
be
an
army
thousands
strong
concealed
a
day
journey
from
the
manors
and
never
a
word
would
be
heard
of
it
but
they
tell
me
the
indians
are
changed
nowadays
i
put
in
they
say
they
settled
down
to
peaceful
ways
like
any
christian
put
your
head
into
a
catamount
mouth
if
you
please
he
said
grimly
but
never
trust
an
indian
the
only
good
kind
is
the
dead
kind
i
tell
you
we
living
on
the
edge
of
hell
it
may
come
this
year
or
next
year
or
five
years
hence
but
come
it
will
i
hear
we
are
fighting
the
french
and
that
means
that
the
tribes
of
the
canadas
will
be
on
the
move
little
you
know
the
speed
of
a
they
would
cut
my
throat
one
morning
and
be
hammering
at
the
doors
of
james
town
before
sundown
there
should
be
a
line
of
forts
in
the
west
from
the
roanoke
to
the
potomac
and
every
man
within
fifty
miles
should
keep
a
gun
loaded
and
a
horse
saddled
but
think
you
the
council
will
move
it
costs
money
say
the
wiseacres
as
if
money
were
not
cheaper
than
a
slit
wizzand
i
was
deeply
solemnized
though
i
scarce
understood
the
full
drift
of
his
words
and
the
queer
thing
was
that
i
was
not
i
had
come
out
to
seek
for
trade
and
it
looked
as
if
i
were
to
find
war
and
all
this
when
i
was
not
four
hours
landed
what
think
you
of
that
he
asked
as
i
kept
silent
i
been
warned
a
man
i
know
on
the
rappahannock
passed
the
word
that
the
long
house
was
stirring
tell
that
to
the
gentry
in
james
town
what
side
are
you
going
for
young
sir
i
take
my
time
i
said
and
see
for
myself
ask
me
again
this
day
six
months
he
laughed
loud
a
very
proper
answer
for
a
scot
he
cried
see
for
yourself
travel
the
country
and
use
the
wits
god
gave
you
to
form
your
judgment
he
paid
the
lawing
and
said
he
would
put
me
on
the
road
back
these
alleys
are
not
very
healthy
at
this
hour
for
a
young
gentleman
in
braw
clothes
once
outside
the
tavern
he
led
me
by
many
curious
till
i
found
myself
on
the
just
below
the
it
struck
me
that
my
new
friend
was
not
a
popular
personage
in
the
town
for
he
would
stop
and
reconnoitre
at
every
turning
and
he
chose
the
darkest
side
of
the
road
to
you
he
said
at
length
and
when
you
have
finished
your
travels
come
west
to
the
south
fork
river
and
ask
for
simon
frew
and
i
complete
your
education
i
went
to
bed
in
a
glow
of
excitement
on
the
morrow
i
should
begin
a
new
life
in
a
world
of
wonders
and
i
rejoiced
to
think
that
there
was
more
than
merchandise
in
the
prospect
chapter
vi
tells
of
my
education
i
had
not
been
a
week
in
the
place
before
i
saw
one
thing
very
clear
that
i
should
never
get
on
with
lambie
his
notion
of
business
was
to
walk
down
the
street
in
a
fine
coat
and
to
sleep
with
a
kerchief
over
his
face
in
some
shady
veranda
there
was
no
vice
in
the
creature
but
there
was
mighty
little
sense
he
lived
in
awe
of
the
great
and
rich
and
a
nod
from
a
big
planter
would
make
him
happy
for
a
week
he
used
to
deafen
me
with
tales
of
colonel
randolph
and
worshipful
carew
and
colonel
byrd
new
house
at
westover
and
the
rare
fashion
in
cravats
that
young
mason
showed
at
the
last
surrey
now
when
a
scot
chooses
to
be
a
sycophant
he
is
more
in
the
job
than
any
one
else
on
the
globe
and
i
grew
very
weary
of
lambie
he
was
no
better
than
an
old
wife
and
as
timid
as
a
hare
forbye
when
i
spoke
of
fighting
the
english
merchants
he
held
up
his
hands
as
if
i
had
uttered
blasphemy
so
being
determined
to
find
out
for
myself
the
truth
about
this
wonderful
new
land
i
left
him
the
business
in
the
town
bought
two
good
horses
hired
a
servant
by
name
john
faulkner
who
had
worked
out
his
time
as
a
redemptioner
and
set
out
on
my
travels
this
is
a
history
of
doings
not
of
thoughts
or
i
would
have
much
to
tell
of
what
i
saw
during
those
months
when
lean
as
a
bone
and
brown
as
a
hazelnut
i
tracked
the
course
of
the
great
rivers
the
roads
were
rough
where
roads
there
were
but
the
land
smiled
under
the
sun
and
the
virginians
high
and
low
kept
open
house
for
the
chance
traveller
one
night
i
would
eat
pork
and
hominy
with
a
rough
fellow
who
was
carving
a
farm
out
of
the
forest
and
the
next
i
would
sit
in
a
fine
panelled
hall
and
listen
to
gentlefolks
speech
and
dine
off
damask
and
silver
i
could
not
tire
of
the
green
forests
or
the
marshes
alive
with
wild
fowl
or
the
noble
orchards
and
gardens
or
even
the
salty
dunes
of
the
chesapeake
shore
my
one
complaint
was
that
the
land
was
desperate
flat
to
a
soul
like
mine
but
one
evening
away
north
in
stafford
county
i
cast
my
eyes
to
the
west
and
saw
blue
and
sharp
against
the
sunset
a
great
line
of
mountains
it
was
all
i
sought
somewhere
in
the
west
virginia
had
her
high
lands
and
one
day
i
promised
myself
i
would
ride
the
road
of
the
sun
and
find
their
secret
in
these
months
my
thoughts
were
chiefly
of
trade
and
i
saw
enough
to
prove
the
truth
of
what
the
man
frew
had
told
me
this
richest
land
on
earth
was
held
prisoner
in
the
bonds
of
a
foolish
tyranny
the
rich
were
less
rich
than
their
estates
warranted
and
the
poor
were
ground
down
by
bitter
poverty
there
was
little
corn
in
the
land
tobacco
being
the
sole
means
of
payment
and
this
meant
no
trade
in
the
common
meaning
of
the
word
the
place
was
slowly
bleeding
to
death
and
i
had
a
mind
to
try
and
stanch
its
wounds
the
firm
of
andrew
sempill
was
looked
on
jealously
in
spite
of
all
the
bowings
and
protestations
of
lambie
if
we
were
to
increase
our
trade
it
must
be
at
the
englishman
expense
and
that
could
only
be
done
by
offering
the
people
a
better
way
of
business
when
the
harvest
came
and
the
tobacco
fleet
arrived
i
could
see
how
the
thing
worked
out
our
two
ships
the
of
ayr
and
the
of
glasgow
had
some
trouble
getting
their
cargoes
we
could
only
deal
with
the
smaller
planters
who
were
not
thirled
to
the
big
merchants
and
it
took
us
three
weary
weeks
up
and
down
the
wharves
to
get
our
holds
filled
there
was
a
madness
in
the
place
for
things
from
england
and
unless
a
man
could
label
his
wares
he
could
not
hope
to
catch
a
buyer
fancy
why
i
have
seen
a
fellow
at
a
fair
at
henricus
selling
common
virginian
as
the
best
english
my
uncle
had
sent
out
a
quantity
of
ayrshire
cheeses
mutton
hams
pickled
salmon
dunfermline
linens
paisley
dimity
alloa
worsted
sweet
ale
from
tranent
kilmarnock
cowls
and
a
lot
of
fine
from
the
clydeside
there
was
nothing
common
or
trashy
in
the
whole
consignment
but
the
planters
preferred
some
gewgaws
from
cheapside
or
some
worthless
london
furs
which
they
could
have
bettered
any
day
by
taking
a
gun
and
hunting
their
own
woods
when
my
own
business
was
over
i
would
look
on
at
some
of
the
other
ladings
there
on
the
wharf
would
be
the
planter
with
his
wife
and
family
and
every
servant
about
the
place
and
there
was
the
merchant
skipper
showing
off
his
goods
and
quoting
for
each
a
weight
of
tobacco
the
planter
wanted
to
get
rid
of
his
crop
and
knew
that
this
was
his
only
chance
while
the
merchant
could
very
well
sell
his
leavings
elsewhere
so
the
dice
were
cogged
from
the
start
and
i
have
seen
a
plain
kitchen
chair
sold
for
fifty
pounds
of
or
something
like
the
price
at
which
a
joiner
in
glasgow
would
make
a
score
and
leave
himself
a
handsome
profit
the
upshot
was
that
i
paid
a
visit
to
the
governor
francis
nicholson
whom
my
lord
howard
had
left
as
his
deputy
governor
nicholson
had
come
from
new
york
not
many
months
before
with
a
great
repute
for
and
harsh
dealing
but
i
liked
the
look
of
his
face
and
soldierly
bearing
and
i
never
mind
choler
in
a
man
if
he
have
also
honesty
and
good
sense
so
i
waited
upon
him
at
his
house
close
by
middle
plantation
on
the
road
between
james
town
and
york
river
i
had
a
very
dusty
reception
his
excellency
sat
in
his
long
parlour
among
a
mass
of
books
and
papers
and
and
glared
at
me
from
beneath
lowering
brows
the
man
was
sore
harassed
by
the
government
on
one
side
and
the
virginian
council
on
the
other
and
he
treated
every
stranger
as
a
foe
what
do
you
seek
from
me
he
shouted
if
it
is
some
squabble
you
can
save
your
breath
for
i
am
sick
of
the
shylocks
i
said
very
politely
that
i
was
a
stranger
not
half
a
year
arrived
in
the
country
but
that
i
had
been
using
my
eyes
and
wished
to
submit
my
views
to
his
consideration
go
to
the
council
he
rasped
go
to
that
silken
fool
his
attorney
my
politics
are
not
those
of
the
that
prate
in
this
land
that
is
why
i
came
to
you
i
said
then
without
more
ado
i
gave
him
my
notions
on
the
defence
of
the
colony
for
from
what
i
had
learned
i
judged
that
would
interest
him
most
he
heard
me
with
unexpected
patience
well
now
supposing
you
are
right
i
do
deny
it
virginia
is
a
treasure
house
with
two
of
the
sides
open
to
wind
and
weather
i
told
the
council
that
and
they
would
not
believe
me
here
are
we
at
war
with
france
and
frontenac
is
hammering
at
the
gates
of
new
york
if
that
falls
it
will
soon
be
the
turn
of
maryland
and
next
of
virginia
england
possessions
in
the
west
are
indivisible
and
what
threatens
one
endangers
all
but
think
you
our
virginians
can
see
it
when
i
presented
my
scheme
for
setting
forts
along
the
northern
line
i
could
not
screw
a
guinea
out
of
the
miscreants
the
colony
was
poor
they
cried
and
could
not
afford
it
and
then
the
worshipful
councillors
rode
home
to
swill
madeira
and
loll
on
their
london
beds
god
truth
were
i
not
a
patriot
i
would
welcome
frontenac
to
teach
them
decency
now
i
did
not
think
much
of
the
french
danger
being
far
more
concerned
with
the
peril
in
the
west
but
i
held
my
peace
on
that
subject
it
was
not
my
cue
to
cross
his
excellency
in
his
present
humour
what
makes
the
colony
poor
i
asked
the
planters
are
rich
enough
but
the
richest
man
will
grow
tired
of
bearing
the
whole
burden
of
the
government
i
submit
that
his
majesty
and
the
english
laws
are
chiefly
to
blame
when
the
hollanders
were
suffered
to
trade
here
they
paid
five
shillings
on
every
anker
of
brandy
they
brought
hither
and
ten
shillings
on
every
hogshead
of
tobacco
they
carried
hence
now
every
penny
that
is
raised
must
come
out
of
the
virginians
and
the
englishmen
who
bleed
the
land
go
scot
free
that
true
said
he
and
it
a
damned
disgrace
but
how
am
i
to
better
it
clap
a
tax
on
every
ship
that
passes
point
comfort
outward
bound
i
said
the
merchants
can
well
afford
to
pay
it
listen
to
him
he
laughed
and
what
kind
of
answer
would
i
get
from
my
lord
howard
and
his
majesty
every
greasy
member
would
be
on
his
feet
in
parliament
in
defence
of
what
he
called
english
rights
then
there
would
come
a
dispatch
from
the
government
telling
the
poor
of
virginia
to
go
to
the
devil
he
looked
at
me
curiously
screwing
up
his
eyes
by
the
way
garvald
what
is
your
trade
i
am
a
merchant
like
the
others
i
said
only
my
ships
run
from
glasgow
instead
of
bristol
a
very
pretty
merchant
he
said
quizzically
i
have
heard
that
hawks
should
not
pick
out
hawks
eyes
what
do
you
propose
to
gain
mr
garvald
better
business
i
said
to
be
honest
with
you
sir
i
am
suffering
from
the
close
monopoly
of
the
englishman
and
i
think
the
country
is
suffering
worse
i
have
a
notion
that
things
can
be
remedied
if
you
can
not
put
on
a
levy
good
and
well
that
is
your
business
but
i
mean
to
make
an
effort
on
my
own
account
then
i
told
him
something
of
my
scheme
and
he
heard
me
out
with
a
puzzled
face
of
all
the
brazen
scots
he
cried
scot
yourself
i
laughed
for
his
face
and
speech
betrayed
him
i
not
deny
that
there
glimmerings
of
sense
in
you
garvald
but
how
do
you
a
lad
with
no
backing
propose
to
beat
a
strong
monopoly
buttressed
by
the
whole
stupidity
and
idleness
of
virginia
you
be
stripped
of
your
last
farthing
and
you
be
lucky
if
it
ends
there
do
think
i
against
you
i
with
you
in
your
principles
but
the
job
is
too
big
for
you
we
will
see
said
i
but
i
can
take
it
that
provided
i
keep
within
the
law
his
majesty
governor
will
not
stand
in
my
way
i
can
promise
you
that
i
do
more
for
i
drink
success
to
your
enterprise
he
filled
me
a
great
silver
tankard
of
spiced
sack
and
i
emptied
it
to
the
toast
of
honest
men
all
the
time
at
the
back
of
my
head
were
other
thoughts
than
merchandise
the
picture
which
frew
had
drawn
of
virginia
as
a
smiling
garden
on
the
edge
of
a
burning
pit
was
stamped
on
my
memory
i
had
seen
on
my
travels
the
indians
that
dwelled
in
the
tidewater
remnants
of
the
old
great
clans
of
doeg
and
powhatan
and
pamunkey
they
were
civil
enough
fellows
following
their
own
ways
and
not
molesting
their
scanty
white
neighbours
for
the
country
was
wide
enough
for
all
but
so
far
as
i
could
learn
these
clanlets
of
the
algonquin
house
were
no
more
comparable
to
the
fighting
tribes
of
the
west
than
a
highland
caddie
in
an
edinburgh
close
is
to
a
hill
macdonald
with
a
claymore
but
the
common
virginian
would
admit
no
peril
though
now
and
then
some
rough
landward
fellow
would
lay
down
his
spade
spit
moodily
and
tell
me
a
grim
tale
i
had
ever
the
notion
to
visit
frew
and
finish
my
education
it
was
not
till
the
tobacco
ships
had
gone
and
the
autumn
had
grown
late
that
i
got
the
chance
the
trees
were
flaming
scarlet
and
saffron
as
i
rode
west
through
the
forests
to
his
house
on
the
south
fork
river
there
by
a
wood
fire
in
the
october
dusk
he
fed
me
on
wild
turkey
and
barley
bread
and
listened
silently
to
my
tale
he
said
nothing
when
i
spoke
of
my
schemes
for
getting
the
better
of
the
englishman
and
winning
virginia
to
my
side
profits
interested
him
little
for
he
grew
his
patch
of
corn
and
pumpkins
and
hunted
the
deer
for
his
own
slender
needs
once
he
broke
in
on
my
rigmarole
with
a
piece
of
news
that
fluttered
me
you
mind
the
big
man
you
were
chasing
that
night
you
and
me
first
forgathered
well
i
seen
him
where
i
cried
all
else
forgotten
here
in
this
very
place
six
weeks
syne
he
stalked
in
about
ten
the
night
and
lifted
half
my
plenishing
when
i
got
up
in
my
bed
to
face
him
he
felled
me
see
there
the
mark
of
it
and
he
showed
a
long
scar
on
his
forehead
he
went
off
with
my
best
axe
a
gill
of
brandy
and
a
good
coat
he
was
looking
for
my
gun
too
but
that
was
in
a
i
got
up
next
morning
with
a
dizzy
head
and
followed
him
nigh
ten
miles
i
had
a
shot
at
him
but
i
missed
and
his
legs
were
too
long
for
me
yon
the
dangerous
lad
where
did
he
go
think
you
i
asked
to
the
hills
to
the
refuge
of
every
belike
the
indians
have
got
his
scalp
and
i
not
regretting
it
i
spent
three
days
with
frew
and
each
day
i
had
the
notion
that
he
was
putting
me
to
the
test
the
first
day
he
took
me
over
the
river
into
a
great
tangle
of
meadow
and
woodland
beyond
which
rose
the
hazy
shapes
of
the
western
mountains
the
man
was
twenty
years
my
elder
but
my
youth
was
of
no
avail
against
his
iron
strength
though
i
was
hard
and
spare
from
my
travels
in
the
summer
heat
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
up
with
him
and
only
my
pride
kept
me
from
crying
halt
often
when
he
stopped
i
could
have
wept
with
fatigue
and
had
no
breath
for
a
word
but
his
taciturnity
saved
me
from
shame
in
a
hollow
among
the
woods
we
came
to
a
place
which
sent
him
on
his
knees
peering
and
sniffing
like
a
what
make
you
of
that
he
asked
i
saw
nothing
but
a
bare
patch
in
the
grass
some
broken
twigs
and
a
few
ashes
it
an
old
camp
i
said
ay
said
he
nothing
more
use
your
wits
man
i
used
them
but
they
gave
me
no
help
this
is
the
way
i
read
it
then
he
said
three
men
camped
here
before
midday
they
were
cherokees
of
the
matabaw
tribe
and
one
was
a
maker
of
arrows
they
were
not
hunting
and
they
were
in
a
mighty
hurry
just
now
they
maybe
ten
miles
off
or
maybe
they
watching
us
this
is
no
healthy
country
for
you
and
me
he
took
me
homeward
at
a
speed
which
foundered
me
and
when
i
questioned
him
he
told
me
where
he
got
his
knowledge
they
were
three
men
for
there
were
three
different
footmarks
in
the
ashes
edge
and
they
were
cherokees
because
they
made
their
fire
in
the
cherokee
way
so
that
the
smoke
ran
in
a
tunnel
into
the
scrub
they
were
matabaws
from
the
pattern
of
their
moccasins
they
were
in
a
hurry
for
they
did
not
wait
to
scatter
the
ashes
and
clear
up
the
place
and
they
were
not
hunting
for
they
cooked
no
flesh
one
was
an
for
he
had
been
hardening
in
the
fire
and
left
behind
him
the
thong
but
how
could
you
know
how
long
back
this
had
happened
i
asked
the
sap
was
still
wet
in
the
twigs
so
it
could
not
have
been
much
above
an
hour
since
they
left
besides
the
smoke
had
blown
south
for
the
grass
smelt
of
it
that
side
now
the
wind
was
more
to
the
east
when
we
left
and
if
you
remember
it
changed
to
the
north
about
midday
i
said
it
was
a
marvel
and
he
grunted
the
marvel
is
what
been
doing
in
the
tidewater
for
from
the
tidewater
i
swear
they
came
next
day
he
led
me
eastward
away
back
in
the
direction
of
the
manors
this
was
an
easier
day
for
he
went
slow
as
if
seeking
for
something
he
picked
up
some
kind
of
a
trail
which
we
followed
through
the
long
afternoon
then
he
found
something
which
he
pocketed
with
a
cry
of
satisfaction
we
were
then
on
the
edge
of
a
ridge
whence
we
looked
south
to
the
orchards
of
henricus
that
is
my
he
cried
showing
me
a
round
stone
whorl
he
a
careless
lad
and
he
lose
half
his
belongings
ere
he
wins
to
the
hills
i
was
prepared
for
the
wild
cherokees
on
our
journey
of
yesterday
but
it
amazed
me
that
the
savages
should
come
scouting
into
the
tidewater
itself
he
smiled
grimly
when
i
said
this
and
took
from
his
pocket
a
crumpled
feather
that
a
cherokee
badge
he
said
i
found
that
a
fortnight
back
on
the
an
hour
ride
out
of
james
town
and
it
wasna
there
when
i
had
passed
the
same
place
the
day
before
the
tidewater
thinks
it
has
put
the
fear
of
god
on
the
hill
tribes
and
here
a
red
cherokee
snowking
about
its
back
doors
the
last
day
he
took
me
north
up
a
stream
called
the
north
fork
which
joined
with
his
own
river
i
had
left
my
musket
behind
for
this
heavy
travel
made
me
crave
to
go
light
and
i
had
no
use
for
it
but
that
day
it
seemed
we
were
to
go
hunting
he
carried
an
old
gun
and
slew
with
it
a
deer
in
a
marshy
hollow
a
pretty
shot
for
the
animal
was
we
broiled
a
steak
for
our
midday
meal
and
presently
clambered
up
a
high
woody
ridge
which
looked
down
on
a
stream
and
a
piece
of
green
meadow
suddenly
he
stopped
a
buck
he
whispered
see
what
you
can
do
you
that
were
so
ready
with
your
pistol
and
he
thrust
his
gun
into
my
hand
the
beast
was
some
thirty
paces
off
in
the
dusk
of
the
thicket
it
nettled
me
to
have
to
shoot
with
a
strange
weapon
and
i
thought
too
lightly
of
the
mark
i
fired
and
the
bullet
whistled
over
its
back
he
laughed
scornfully
i
handed
it
back
to
him
it
throws
high
and
you
did
not
warn
me
load
quick
and
i
try
again
i
heard
the
deer
crashing
through
the
thicket
and
guessed
that
presently
it
would
come
out
in
the
meadow
i
was
right
and
before
the
gun
was
in
my
hands
again
the
beast
was
over
the
stream
it
was
a
long
range
and
a
difficult
mark
but
i
had
to
take
the
risk
for
i
was
on
my
trial
i
allowed
for
the
throw
of
the
musket
and
the
steepness
of
the
hill
and
pulled
the
trigger
the
shot
might
have
been
better
for
i
had
aimed
for
the
shoulder
and
hit
the
neck
the
buck
leaped
into
the
air
ran
three
yards
and
toppled
over
by
the
grace
of
god
i
had
found
the
single
chance
in
a
hundred
frew
looked
at
me
with
sincere
respect
that
braw
shooting
he
said
i
ca
say
i
ever
saw
its
equal
that
night
in
the
smoky
cabin
he
talked
freely
for
once
i
never
had
a
wife
or
bairn
and
i
lean
on
no
man
i
can
fend
for
myself
and
cook
my
dinner
and
mend
my
coat
when
it
wanting
it
when
bacon
died
i
saw
what
was
coming
to
this
land
and
i
came
here
to
await
it
i
had
some
sudden
calls
from
the
red
gentry
but
they
havena
got
me
yet
and
they
no
get
me
before
my
time
i
in
the
lord
hands
and
he
has
a
job
for
simon
frew
go
back
to
your
garvald
beat
the
english
merchants
my
lad
and
take
my
blessing
with
you
but
keep
that
gun
of
yours
by
your
bedside
for
the
time
is
coming
when
a
man
hands
will
have
to
keep
his
head
chapter
vii
i
become
an
unpopular
character
i
did
not
waste
time
in
getting
to
work
i
had
already
written
to
my
uncle
telling
him
my
plans
and
presently
i
received
his
consent
i
arranged
that
cargoes
of
such
goods
as
i
thought
most
suitable
for
virginian
sales
should
arrive
at
regular
seasons
independent
of
the
tobacco
harvest
then
i
set
about
equipping
a
store
on
the
high
land
north
of
james
town
by
the
road
to
middle
plantation
i
bought
some
acres
of
cleared
soil
and
had
built
for
me
a
modest
dwelling
beside
it
stood
a
large
brick
building
one
half
fitted
as
a
tobacco
shed
where
the
leaf
could
lie
for
months
if
need
be
without
taking
harm
and
the
other
arranged
as
a
merchant
store
with
roomy
cellars
and
wide
garrets
i
relinquished
the
warehouse
by
the
james
town
quay
and
to
my
joy
i
was
able
to
relinquish
lambie
that
timid
soul
had
been
on
thorns
ever
since
i
mooted
my
new
projects
he
implored
me
to
put
them
from
me
he
drew
such
pictures
of
the
power
of
the
english
traders
you
would
have
thought
them
the
prince
merchants
of
venice
he
saw
all
his
gentility
gone
at
a
blow
and
himself
an
outcast
precluded
for
ever
from
great
men
recognition
he
could
not
bear
it
and
though
he
was
loyal
to
my
uncle
firm
in
his
own
way
he
sought
a
change
one
day
he
announced
that
he
had
been
offered
a
post
as
steward
to
a
big
planter
at
henricus
and
when
i
warmly
bade
him
accept
it
he
smiled
wanly
and
said
he
had
done
so
a
week
agone
we
parted
very
civilly
and
i
chose
as
manager
my
servant
john
faulkner
this
is
not
a
history
of
my
trading
ventures
or
i
would
tell
at
length
the
steps
i
took
to
found
a
new
way
of
business
i
went
among
the
planters
offering
to
buy
tobacco
from
the
coming
harvest
and
to
pay
for
it
in
bonds
which
could
be
exchanged
for
goods
at
my
store
i
also
offered
to
provide
shipment
in
the
autumn
for
tobacco
and
other
wares
and
i
fixed
the
charge
for
freight
a
very
moderate
one
in
advance
my
plan
was
to
clear
out
my
store
before
the
return
of
the
ships
and
to
have
thereby
a
large
quantity
of
tobacco
mortgaged
to
me
i
hoped
that
thus
i
would
win
the
friendship
and
custom
of
the
planters
since
i
offered
them
a
more
convenient
way
of
sale
and
higher
profits
i
hoped
by
breaking
down
the
english
monopoly
to
induce
a
continual
and
wholesome
commerce
in
the
land
for
this
purpose
it
was
necessary
to
get
coin
into
the
people
hands
so
using
my
uncle
credit
i
had
a
parcel
of
english
money
from
the
new
york
goldsmiths
in
a
week
i
found
myself
the
man
in
the
dominion
and
soon
i
saw
the
troubles
that
credit
brings
i
had
picked
up
a
very
correct
notion
of
the
fortunes
of
most
of
the
planters
and
the
men
who
were
most
eager
to
sell
to
me
were
just
those
i
could
least
trust
some
fellow
who
was
near
bankrupt
from
dice
and
would
offer
me
five
hundred
hogsheads
when
i
knew
that
his
estate
could
scarce
produce
half
i
was
not
a
merchant
out
of
charity
and
i
had
to
decline
many
offers
and
so
made
many
foes
still
one
way
and
another
i
was
not
long
in
clearing
out
my
store
and
i
found
myself
with
some
three
times
the
amount
of
tobacco
in
prospect
that
i
had
sent
home
at
the
last
harvest
that
was
very
well
but
there
was
the
devil
to
pay
besides
every
wastrel
i
sent
off
was
my
enemy
the
agents
of
the
englishmen
looked
sourly
at
me
and
many
a
man
who
was
swindled
grossly
by
the
bristol
buyers
saw
me
as
a
marauder
instead
of
a
benefactor
for
this
i
was
prepared
but
what
staggered
me
was
the
way
that
some
of
the
better
sort
of
the
gentry
came
to
regard
me
it
was
not
that
they
did
not
give
me
their
custom
that
i
did
not
expect
for
gunpowder
alone
would
change
the
habits
of
a
virginian
tory
but
my
new
business
seemed
to
them
such
a
downcome
that
they
passed
me
by
with
a
cock
of
the
chin
before
they
had
treated
me
hospitably
and
made
me
welcome
at
their
houses
i
had
hunted
the
fox
with
them
very
little
to
my
credit
and
shot
wildfowl
in
their
company
with
better
success
i
had
dined
with
them
and
danced
in
their
halls
at
christmas
then
i
had
been
a
gentleman
now
i
was
a
shopkeeper
a
creature
about
the
level
of
a
redemptioner
the
thing
was
so
childish
that
it
made
me
angry
it
was
right
for
one
of
them
to
sell
his
tobacco
on
his
own
wharf
to
a
tarry
skipper
who
cheated
him
grossly
but
wrong
for
me
to
sell
kebbucks
and
at
an
even
bargain
i
gave
up
the
puzzle
some
notions
of
gentility
are
beyond
my
wits
i
had
taken
to
going
to
the
church
in
james
town
first
at
desire
and
then
because
i
liked
the
sermons
there
on
a
sunday
you
would
see
the
fashion
of
the
neighbourhood
for
the
planters
ladies
rode
in
on
pillions
and
the
planters
themselves
in
waistcoats
and
plush
breeches
and
wigs
leaned
on
the
tombstones
and
exchanged
snuffmulls
and
gossip
in
the
old
ramshackle
graveyard
you
would
see
such
a
parade
of
satin
bodices
and
tabby
petticoats
and
lace
headgear
as
made
it
blossom
like
the
rose
i
went
to
church
one
sunday
in
my
second
summer
and
being
late
went
up
the
aisle
looking
for
a
place
the
men
at
the
would
not
stir
to
accommodate
me
and
i
had
to
find
rest
in
the
i
thought
nothing
of
it
but
the
close
of
the
service
was
to
enlighten
me
as
i
went
down
the
churchyard
not
a
man
or
woman
gave
me
greeting
and
when
i
spoke
to
any
i
was
not
answered
these
were
men
with
whom
i
had
been
on
the
friendliest
terms
women
too
who
only
a
week
before
had
chaffered
with
me
at
the
store
it
was
clear
that
the
little
society
had
marooned
me
to
an
isle
by
myself
i
was
a
leper
unfit
for
gentlefolks
company
because
forsooth
i
had
sold
goods
which
every
one
of
them
did
also
and
had
tried
to
sell
them
fair
the
thing
made
me
very
bitter
i
sat
in
my
house
during
the
hot
noons
when
no
one
stirred
and
black
anger
filled
my
heart
i
grew
as
peevish
as
a
slighted
girl
and
would
no
doubt
have
fretted
myself
into
some
signal
folly
had
not
an
event
occurred
which
braced
my
soul
again
this
was
the
arrival
of
the
english
convoy
when
i
heard
that
the
ships
were
sighted
i
made
certain
of
trouble
i
had
meantime
added
to
my
staff
two
other
young
men
who
like
faulkner
lived
with
me
at
the
store
also
i
had
got
four
stalwart
negro
slaves
who
slept
in
a
hut
in
my
garden
was
a
strong
enough
force
to
repel
a
drunken
posse
from
the
plantations
and
i
had
a
fancy
that
it
would
be
needed
in
the
coming
weeks
two
days
later
going
down
the
street
of
james
town
i
met
one
of
the
english
skippers
a
redfaced
old
ruffian
called
bullivant
he
was
full
of
and
strutted
across
the
way
to
accost
me
what
this
i
hear
sawney
he
cried
you
setting
up
as
a
pedlar
and
trying
to
cut
in
on
our
trade
od
twist
me
but
we
put
an
end
to
that
my
think
the
king
god
bless
him
made
the
laws
for
a
sawney
to
diddle
englishmen
what
the
king
bench
say
to
that
think
ye
he
was
very
abusive
but
very
uncertain
on
his
legs
i
said
that
i
welcomed
process
of
law
and
would
defend
my
action
he
shook
his
head
and
said
something
about
law
not
being
everything
and
england
being
a
long
road
off
he
had
clearly
some
great
threat
to
be
delivered
of
but
just
then
he
sat
down
so
heavily
that
he
had
no
breath
for
anything
but
curses
but
the
drunkard
had
given
me
a
notion
i
hurried
home
and
gave
instructions
to
my
men
to
keep
a
special
guard
on
the
store
then
i
set
off
in
a
pinnace
to
find
my
three
ships
which
were
now
lading
up
and
down
among
the
creeks
that
was
the
beginning
of
a
fortnight
struggle
when
every
man
hand
was
against
me
and
i
enjoyed
myself
surprisingly
i
was
never
at
rest
by
land
or
water
the
ships
were
the
least
of
the
business
for
the
dour
scots
seamen
were
a
match
for
all
comers
i
made
them
anchor
at
twilight
in
for
safety
sake
for
in
that
drouthy
clime
a
firebrand
might
play
havoc
with
them
the
worst
that
happened
was
that
one
moonless
night
a
band
of
rascals
rigged
out
as
indian
braves
came
yelling
down
to
the
quay
where
some
tobacco
was
waiting
to
be
shipped
and
before
my
men
were
warned
had
tipped
a
couple
of
hogsheads
into
the
water
they
got
no
further
for
we
fell
upon
them
with
and
hatchets
stripped
them
of
their
feathers
and
sent
them
to
cool
their
heads
in
the
muddy
river
the
i
haled
to
james
town
and
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
grinning
through
a
collar
in
the
common
stocks
then
i
hied
me
back
to
my
store
which
was
my
worst
anxiety
i
was
followed
by
ill
names
as
i
went
down
the
street
and
one
day
in
a
tavern
a
young
fool
drew
his
shabble
on
me
but
i
would
quarrel
with
no
man
for
that
was
a
luxury
beyond
a
trader
there
had
been
an
attack
on
my
tobacco
shed
by
some
of
the
english
seamen
and
in
the
mellay
one
of
my
blacks
got
an
ugly
wound
from
a
cutlass
it
was
only
a
foretaste
and
i
set
my
house
in
order
one
afternoon
john
faulkner
brought
me
word
that
mischief
would
be
afoot
at
the
darkening
i
put
each
man
to
his
station
and
i
had
the
sense
to
picket
them
a
little
distance
from
the
house
the
englishmen
were
clumsy
conspirators
we
watched
them
arrive
let
them
pass
and
followed
silently
on
their
heels
their
business
was
wreckage
and
they
fixed
a
charge
of
powder
by
the
tobacco
shed
laid
and
lit
a
fuse
and
retired
discreetly
into
the
bushes
to
watch
their
handiwork
then
we
fell
upon
them
and
the
hindquarters
of
all
bore
witness
to
our
greeting
i
caught
the
fellow
who
had
laid
the
fuse
tied
the
whole
thing
round
his
neck
clapped
a
pistol
to
his
ear
and
marched
him
before
me
into
the
town
if
you
are
minded
to
bolt
i
said
remember
you
have
a
charge
of
gunpowder
lobbing
below
your
chin
i
have
but
to
flash
my
pistol
into
it
and
they
will
be
picking
the
bits
of
you
off
the
high
trees
i
took
the
rascal
his
knees
knocking
under
him
straight
to
the
ordinary
where
the
english
merchants
chiefly
forgathered
a
dozen
of
them
sat
over
a
bowl
of
punch
when
the
door
was
opened
and
i
kicked
my
guy
fawkes
inside
i
may
have
misjudged
them
but
i
thought
every
eye
looked
furtive
as
they
saw
my
prisoner
gentlemen
said
i
i
restore
you
your
property
this
is
a
penitent
thief
who
desires
to
make
a
confession
my
pistol
was
at
his
temple
the
powder
was
round
his
neck
and
he
must
have
seen
a
certain
resolution
in
my
face
anyhow
sweating
and
quaking
he
blurted
out
his
story
and
when
he
offered
to
halt
i
made
rings
with
the
barrel
on
the
flesh
of
his
neck
it
is
a
damned
lie
cried
one
of
them
a
handsome
fellow
who
had
been
conspicuous
for
his
public
insolence
towards
me
nay
said
i
our
penitent
tale
has
the
note
of
truth
one
word
to
you
gentlemen
i
am
hospitably
inclined
and
if
any
one
of
you
will
so
far
honour
me
as
to
come
himself
instead
of
dispatching
his
servant
his
welcome
will
be
the
warmer
i
bid
you
and
leave
you
this
fellow
in
proof
of
my
goodwill
keep
him
away
from
the
candle
i
pray
you
or
you
will
all
go
to
hell
before
your
time
that
was
the
end
of
my
worst
troubles
and
presently
my
lading
was
finished
and
my
store
replenished
then
came
the
time
for
the
return
sailing
and
the
last
enterprise
of
my
friends
was
to
go
off
without
my
three
vessels
but
i
got
an
order
from
the
governor
delivered
readily
but
with
much
profanity
to
the
commander
of
the
frigates
to
delay
till
the
convoy
was
complete
i
breathed
more
freely
as
i
saw
the
last
hulls
grow
small
in
the
estuary
for
now
as
i
reasoned
it
out
the
planters
must
begin
to
compare
my
prices
with
the
englishmen
and
must
come
to
see
where
their
advantage
lay
but
i
had
counted
my
chickens
too
soon
and
was
to
be
woefully
disappointed
at
that
time
all
the
coast
of
america
from
new
england
to
the
main
was
infested
by
pirate
vessels
some
sailed
under
english
letters
of
marque
and
preyed
only
on
the
shipping
of
france
with
whom
we
were
at
war
some
who
had
formed
themselves
into
a
company
called
the
brethren
of
the
coast
robbed
the
spanish
and
merchantmen
in
the
south
waters
and
rarely
came
north
to
our
parts
save
to
careen
or
provision
they
were
mostly
english
and
welsh
with
a
few
frenchmen
and
though
i
had
little
to
say
for
their
doings
they
left
british
ships
in
the
main
unmolested
and
were
welcomed
as
a
godsend
by
our
coast
dwellers
since
they
smuggled
goods
to
them
which
would
have
been
twice
the
cost
if
bought
at
the
convoy
markets
lastly
there
were
one
or
two
horrid
desperadoes
who
ravaged
the
seas
like
tigers
such
an
one
was
the
man
cosh
and
that
teach
surnamed
blackbeard
of
whom
we
hear
too
much
but
on
the
whole
we
of
virginia
suffered
not
at
all
from
these
gentlemen
of
fortune
and
piracy
though
the
common
peril
of
the
seas
entered
but
little
into
the
estimation
of
the
merchants
judge
then
of
my
disgust
when
i
got
news
a
week
later
that
one
of
my
ships
the
ayr
brig
had
straggled
from
the
convoy
and
been
seized
rifled
and
burned
to
the
water
by
pirates
almost
in
sight
of
cape
charles
the
loss
was
grievous
but
what
angered
me
was
the
mystery
of
such
a
happening
i
knew
the
brig
was
a
slow
sailer
but
how
in
the
name
of
honesty
could
she
be
suffered
in
broad
daylight
to
fall
into
such
a
fate
i
remembered
the
hostility
of
the
englishmen
and
feared
she
had
had
foul
play
just
after
i
expected
two
ships
to
replenish
the
stock
in
my
store
they
arrived
safe
but
only
by
the
skin
of
their
teeth
for
both
had
been
chased
from
their
first
entrance
into
american
waters
and
only
their
big
topsails
and
a
favouring
wind
brought
them
off
i
examined
the
captains
closely
on
the
matter
and
they
were
positive
that
their
assailant
was
not
cosh
or
any
one
of
his
kidney
but
a
ship
of
the
brethren
who
ordinarily
were
on
the
best
of
terms
with
our
merchantmen
my
suspicions
now
grew
into
a
fever
i
had
long
believed
that
there
was
some
connivance
between
the
pirates
of
the
coast
and
the
english
traders
and
small
blame
to
them
for
it
was
a
sensible
way
to
avoid
trouble
and
i
for
one
would
rather
pay
a
modest
blackmail
every
month
or
two
than
run
the
risk
of
losing
a
good
ship
and
a
cargo
but
when
it
came
to
using
this
connivance
for
private
spite
the
thing
was
not
to
be
endured
in
march
my
doubts
became
certainties
i
had
a
parcel
of
gold
coin
coming
to
me
from
new
york
in
one
of
the
coasting
vessels
no
great
sum
but
more
than
i
cared
to
lose
presently
i
had
news
that
the
ship
was
aground
on
a
sandspit
on
accomac
and
had
been
plundered
by
a
pirate
brigantine
i
got
a
sloop
and
went
down
the
river
and
sure
enough
i
found
the
vessel
newly
refloated
and
the
captain
an
old
new
hampshire
fellow
in
a
great
taking
piracy
there
had
been
but
of
a
queer
kind
for
not
a
farthing
worth
had
been
touched
except
my
packet
of
gold
the
skipper
was
honesty
itself
and
it
was
plain
that
the
pirate
who
had
chased
the
ship
aground
and
then
come
aboard
to
plunder
had
done
it
to
do
me
hurt
and
me
alone
all
this
made
me
feel
pretty
solemn
my
uncle
was
a
rich
man
but
no
firm
could
afford
these
repeated
losses
i
was
the
most
unpopular
figure
in
virginia
hated
by
many
despised
by
the
genteel
whose
only
friends
were
my
own
servants
and
a
few
landward
folk
i
had
found
out
a
good
way
of
trade
but
i
had
set
a
hornet
nest
buzzing
about
my
ears
and
was
on
the
fair
way
to
be
extinguished
this
alliance
between
my
rivals
and
the
free
companions
was
the
last
straw
to
my
burden
if
the
sea
was
to
be
shut
to
him
then
a
merchant
might
as
well
put
up
his
shutters
it
made
me
solemn
but
also
most
mightily
angry
if
the
stars
in
their
courses
were
going
to
fight
against
andrew
garvald
they
should
find
him
ready
i
went
to
the
governor
but
he
gave
me
no
comfort
indeed
he
laughed
at
me
and
bade
me
try
the
same
weapon
as
my
adversaries
i
left
him
very
wrathful
and
after
a
night
sleep
i
began
to
see
reason
in
his
words
clearly
the
law
of
virginia
or
of
england
would
give
me
no
redress
i
was
an
alien
from
the
genteel
world
why
should
i
not
get
the
benefit
of
my
ungentility
if
my
rivals
went
for
their
weapons
into
dark
places
i
could
surely
do
likewise
a
line
of
virgil
came
into
my
head
which
seemed
to
me
to
contain
very
good
counsel
si
nequeo
superos
acheronta
which
means
that
if
you
can
not
get
heaven
on
your
side
you
had
better
try
for
the
devil
but
how
was
i
to
get
into
touch
with
the
devil
and
then
i
remembered
in
a
flash
my
meeting
with
the
on
the
glasgow
stairhead
and
his
promise
to
help
me
i
had
no
notion
who
he
was
or
how
he
could
aid
but
i
had
a
vague
memory
of
his
power
and
briskness
he
had
looked
like
the
kind
of
lad
who
might
conduct
me
into
the
wild
world
of
the
free
companions
i
sought
mercer
tavern
by
the
a
melancholy
place
grown
up
with
weeds
with
a
yard
of
dark
trees
at
the
back
of
it
old
mercer
was
an
elder
in
the
little
wooden
presbyterian
kirk
which
i
had
taken
to
attending
since
my
quarrels
with
the
gentry
he
knew
me
and
greeted
me
with
his
doleful
smile
shaking
his
foolish
old
beard
what
your
errand
this
mr
garvald
he
said
in
broad
scots
will
you
drink
a
rummer
o
toddy
or
try
some
fine
auld
usquebaugh
i
hae
got
frae
my
cousin
in
buchan
i
sat
down
on
the
settle
outside
the
tavern
door
this
is
my
errand
i
want
you
to
bring
me
to
a
man
or
bring
that
man
to
me
his
name
is
ninian
campbell
mercer
looked
at
me
dully
there
was
a
lad
o
that
name
was
hanged
at
inveraray
i
for
stealin
twae
hens
and
a
wether
the
man
i
mean
is
long
and
lean
and
his
head
is
as
red
as
fire
he
gave
me
your
name
so
you
must
know
him
his
eyes
showed
no
recognition
he
repeated
the
name
to
himself
mumbling
it
toothlessly
it
sticks
i
my
memory
he
said
but
when
and
where
i
canna
tell
certes
there
no
man
o
the
name
in
virginia
i
was
beginning
to
think
that
my
memory
had
played
me
false
when
suddenly
the
whole
scene
in
the
saltmarket
leaped
vividly
to
my
brain
then
i
remembered
the
something
else
i
had
been
enjoined
to
say
ninian
campbell
i
went
on
bade
me
ask
for
him
here
and
i
was
to
tell
you
that
the
lymphads
are
on
the
loch
and
the
horn
of
diarmaid
has
sounded
in
a
twinkling
his
face
changed
from
vacancy
to
shrewdness
and
from
senility
to
purpose
he
glanced
uneasily
round
for
god
sake
speak
soft
he
whispered
come
inside
man
steek
the
door
and
then
i
hear
your
business
chapter
viii
red
ringan
once
at
edinburgh
college
i
had
read
the
latin
tale
of
apuleius
and
the
beginning
stuck
in
my
memory
ex
negotio
i
was
starting
off
for
thrace
on
business
that
was
my
case
now
i
was
about
to
plunge
into
a
wild
world
for
no
more
startling
causes
than
that
i
was
a
trader
who
wanted
to
save
my
pocket
it
is
to
those
who
seek
only
peace
and
a
quiet
life
that
adventures
fall
the
homely
merchant
jogging
with
his
pack
train
finds
the
enchanted
forest
and
the
sleeping
princess
and
saul
busily
searching
for
his
asses
stumbles
upon
a
kingdom
what
seek
ye
with
ringan
mercer
asked
when
we
had
sat
down
inside
with
locked
doors
the
man
name
is
ninian
campbell
i
said
somewhat
puzzled
well
it
the
same
thing
what
did
they
teach
you
at
lesmahagow
if
ye
do
know
that
ringan
is
the
scots
for
ninian
lord
bless
me
laddie
do
tell
me
ye
never
heard
of
red
ringan
to
be
sure
i
had
i
had
heard
of
little
else
for
a
twelvemonth
in
every
tavern
in
virginia
when
men
talked
of
the
free
companions
it
was
the
name
of
red
ringan
that
came
first
to
their
tongues
i
had
been
too
occupied
by
my
own
affairs
to
listen
just
then
to
fireside
tales
but
i
could
not
help
hearing
of
this
man
exploits
he
was
a
kind
of
leader
of
the
buccaneers
and
by
all
accounts
no
miscreant
like
cosh
but
a
mirthful
fellow
striking
hard
when
need
be
but
at
other
times
merciful
and
jovial
now
i
set
little
store
by
your
pirate
heroes
they
are
for
lads
and
silly
girls
and
sots
in
an
and
a
merchant
can
have
no
kindness
for
those
who
are
the
foes
of
his
trade
so
when
i
heard
that
the
man
i
sought
was
this
notorious
buccaneer
i
showed
my
alarm
by
dropping
my
jaw
mercer
laughed
i
not
conceal
from
you
that
you
take
a
certain
risk
in
going
to
ringan
ye
need
not
tell
me
your
business
but
it
should
be
a
grave
one
to
take
you
down
to
the
carolina
keys
there
time
to
draw
back
if
ye
want
but
you
brought
me
the
master
word
and
i
bound
to
set
you
on
the
road
just
one
word
to
ye
garvald
keep
a
stout
face
whatever
you
see
for
ringan
has
a
weakness
for
a
bold
man
be
here
the
morn
at
sunrise
and
if
ye
wise
bring
no
weapon
i
see
to
the
boat
and
the
provisioning
i
was
at
the
next
day
at
while
the
mist
was
still
low
on
the
river
mercer
was
busy
putting
food
and
a
keg
of
water
into
a
light
sloop
and
a
tall
indian
was
aboard
redding
out
the
sails
my
travels
had
given
me
some
knowledge
of
the
red
tribes
and
i
spoke
a
little
of
their
language
but
this
man
was
of
a
type
not
often
seen
in
the
virginian
lowlands
he
was
very
tall
with
a
skin
clear
and
polished
like
bronze
and
unlike
the
ordinary
savage
his
breast
was
unmarked
and
his
hair
unadorned
he
was
naked
to
the
waist
and
below
wore
long
leather
breeches
dyed
red
and
fringed
with
tails
in
his
wampum
belt
were
stuck
a
brace
of
knives
and
a
tomahawk
it
seemed
he
knew
me
for
as
i
approached
he
stood
up
to
his
full
height
and
put
his
hands
on
his
forehead
brother
he
said
and
his
grave
eyes
looked
steadily
into
mine
then
i
remembered
some
months
before
i
had
been
riding
back
the
road
from
green
springs
and
in
a
dark
woody
place
had
come
across
an
indian
sore
beset
by
three
of
the
white
scum
which
infested
the
what
the
quarrel
was
i
know
not
but
i
liked
little
the
villainous
look
of
the
three
and
i
liked
much
the
clean
lithe
figure
of
their
opponent
so
i
rode
my
horse
among
them
and
laid
on
to
them
with
the
butt
of
my
whip
they
had
their
knives
out
but
i
managed
to
disarm
the
one
who
attacked
me
and
my
horse
upset
a
second
while
the
indian
who
had
no
weapon
but
a
stave
cracked
the
head
of
the
last
i
got
nothing
worse
than
a
black
eye
but
the
man
i
had
rescued
bled
from
some
ugly
cuts
which
i
had
much
ado
stanching
he
shook
hands
with
me
gravely
when
i
had
done
and
vanished
into
the
thicket
he
was
a
seneca
indian
and
i
wondered
what
one
of
that
house
was
doing
in
the
tidewater
mercer
told
me
his
name
shalah
will
take
you
to
the
man
you
ken
do
whatever
he
tells
you
garvald
for
this
is
a
job
in
which
nothing
but
a
bairn
we
pushed
off
the
indian
taking
the
oars
and
in
five
minutes
james
town
was
lost
in
the
haze
on
the
surrey
shore
we
picked
up
a
breeze
and
with
the
ebbing
tide
made
good
speed
down
the
estuary
shalah
the
indian
had
the
tiller
and
i
sat
luxuriously
in
the
bows
smoking
my
cob
pipe
and
wondering
what
the
next
week
held
in
store
for
me
the
night
before
i
had
had
qualms
about
the
whole
business
but
the
air
of
morning
has
a
trick
of
firing
my
blood
and
i
believe
i
had
forgotten
the
errand
which
was
taking
me
to
the
carolina
shores
it
was
enough
that
i
was
going
into
a
new
land
and
new
company
last
night
i
had
thought
with
disfavour
of
red
ringan
the
buccaneer
that
morning
i
thought
only
of
ninian
campbell
with
whom
i
had
forgathered
on
a
glasgow
landing
my
own
thoughts
kept
me
silent
and
the
indian
never
opened
his
mouth
like
a
statue
he
crouched
by
the
tiller
with
his
sombre
eyes
looking
to
the
sea
that
night
when
we
had
rounded
cape
henry
in
fine
weather
we
ran
the
sloop
into
a
little
bay
below
a
headland
and
made
camp
for
the
night
beside
a
stream
of
cold
water
next
morning
it
blew
hard
from
the
north
and
in
a
driving
rain
we
crept
down
the
carolina
coast
one
incident
of
the
day
i
remember
i
took
in
a
reef
or
two
and
adjusted
the
sheets
for
this
was
a
game
i
knew
and
loved
the
indian
watched
me
closely
and
made
a
sign
to
me
to
take
the
helm
he
had
guessed
that
i
knew
more
than
himself
about
the
handling
of
a
boat
in
wind
and
since
we
were
in
an
open
sea
where
his
guidance
was
not
needed
he
preferred
to
trust
the
thing
to
me
i
liked
the
trait
in
him
for
i
take
it
to
be
a
mark
of
a
wise
man
that
he
knows
what
he
can
do
and
is
not
ashamed
to
admit
what
he
can
not
that
evening
we
had
a
cold
bed
but
the
storm
blew
out
in
the
night
and
the
next
day
the
sun
was
as
hot
as
summer
and
the
wind
a
point
to
the
east
shalah
once
again
was
steersman
for
we
were
inside
some
very
ugly
reefs
which
i
took
to
be
the
beginning
of
the
carolina
keys
on
shore
forests
straggled
down
to
the
sea
so
that
sometimes
they
almost
had
their
feet
in
the
surf
but
now
and
then
would
come
an
open
grassy
space
running
far
inland
these
were
the
great
savannahs
where
herds
of
wild
cattle
and
deer
roamed
and
where
the
free
companions
came
to
fill
their
larders
it
was
a
wilder
land
than
the
tidewater
for
only
once
did
we
see
a
human
dwelling
far
remote
on
the
savannahs
i
could
pick
out
twirls
of
smoke
rising
into
the
blue
weather
the
signs
of
indian
hunting
fires
shalah
began
now
to
look
for
landmarks
and
to
take
bearings
of
a
sort
among
the
maze
of
creeks
and
shallow
bays
which
opened
on
the
land
side
it
needed
an
indian
to
pick
out
a
track
the
sun
had
all
but
set
when
with
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
he
swung
round
the
tiller
and
headed
shorewards
before
me
in
the
twilight
i
saw
only
a
wooded
bluff
which
as
we
approached
divided
itself
into
two
presently
a
channel
appeared
a
narrow
thing
about
as
broad
as
a
cable
length
into
which
the
wind
carried
us
here
it
was
very
dark
the
high
sides
with
their
gloomy
trees
showing
at
the
top
a
thin
line
of
reddening
sky
shalah
hugged
the
starboard
shore
and
as
the
screen
of
the
forest
caught
the
wind
it
weakened
and
weakened
till
it
died
away
and
we
moved
only
with
the
ingoing
tide
i
had
never
been
in
so
eery
a
place
it
was
full
of
the
sharp
smell
of
pine
trees
and
as
i
sniffed
the
air
i
caught
the
savour
of
wood
smoke
men
were
somewhere
ahead
of
us
in
the
gloom
shalah
ran
the
sloop
into
a
little
creek
so
overgrown
with
vines
that
we
had
to
lie
flat
on
the
thwarts
to
enter
then
putting
his
mouth
to
my
ear
he
spoke
for
the
first
time
since
we
had
left
james
town
it
is
hard
to
approach
the
master
and
my
brother
must
follow
me
close
as
the
panther
follows
the
deer
where
shalah
puts
his
foot
let
my
brother
put
his
also
come
he
stepped
from
the
boat
to
the
and
with
incredible
speed
and
stillness
began
to
ascend
his
long
soft
strides
were
made
without
noise
or
effort
whether
the
ground
were
moss
or
a
tangle
of
vines
or
loose
stones
or
the
trunks
of
fallen
trees
i
had
prided
myself
on
my
but
beside
the
indian
i
was
a
blundering
child
i
might
have
made
shift
to
travel
as
fast
but
it
was
the
silence
of
his
progress
that
staggered
me
i
plunged
and
slipped
and
sprawled
and
my
heart
was
bursting
before
the
ascent
ceased
and
we
stole
to
the
left
along
the
hill
shoulder
presently
came
a
gap
in
the
trees
and
i
looked
down
in
the
last
greyness
of
dusk
on
a
strange
and
beautiful
sight
the
channel
led
to
a
landlocked
pool
maybe
a
mile
around
and
this
was
as
full
of
shipping
as
a
town
harbour
the
water
was
but
a
pit
of
darkness
but
i
could
make
out
the
masts
rising
into
the
half
light
and
i
counted
more
than
twenty
vessels
in
that
port
no
light
was
shown
and
the
whole
place
was
quiet
as
a
grave
we
entered
a
wood
of
small
hemlocks
and
i
felt
rather
than
saw
the
ground
slope
in
front
of
us
about
two
hundred
feet
above
the
water
the
glen
of
a
little
stream
shaped
itself
into
a
flat
cup
which
was
invisible
from
below
and
girdled
on
three
sides
by
dark
forest
here
we
walked
more
freely
till
we
came
to
the
lip
of
the
cup
and
there
not
twenty
paces
below
me
i
saw
a
wonderful
sight
the
hollow
was
lit
with
the
glow
of
a
dozen
fires
round
which
men
clustered
some
were
busy
boucanning
meat
for
ship
food
some
were
cooking
supper
some
sprawled
in
idleness
and
smoked
or
diced
the
night
had
now
grown
very
black
around
us
and
we
were
well
protected
for
the
men
in
the
glow
had
their
eyes
dazed
and
could
not
spy
into
the
darkness
we
came
very
close
above
them
so
that
i
could
hear
their
talk
the
smell
of
roasting
meat
pricked
my
hunger
and
i
realized
that
the
salt
air
had
given
me
a
noble
thirst
they
were
common
seamen
from
the
pirate
vessels
and
as
far
as
i
could
judge
they
had
no
officer
among
them
i
remarked
their
fierce
dark
faces
and
the
long
knives
with
which
they
slashed
and
trimmed
the
flesh
for
their
boucanning
shalah
touched
my
hand
and
i
followed
him
into
the
wood
we
climbed
again
and
from
the
tinkle
of
the
stream
on
my
left
i
judged
that
we
were
ascending
to
a
higher
shelf
in
the
glen
the
indian
moved
very
carefully
as
noiseless
as
the
flight
of
an
owl
and
i
marvelled
at
the
gift
in
after
days
i
was
to
become
something
of
a
woodsman
and
track
as
swiftly
and
silently
as
any
man
of
my
upbringing
but
i
never
mastered
the
indian
art
by
which
the
foot
descending
in
the
darkness
on
something
that
will
crackle
checks
before
the
noise
is
made
i
could
do
it
by
day
when
i
could
see
what
was
on
the
ground
but
in
the
dark
the
thing
was
beyond
me
it
is
an
instinct
like
a
wild
thing
and
possible
only
to
those
who
have
gone
all
their
days
in
the
forest
suddenly
the
slope
and
the
trees
ceased
and
a
new
glare
burst
on
our
eyes
this
second
shelf
was
smaller
than
the
first
and
as
i
blinked
at
the
light
i
saw
that
it
held
about
a
score
of
men
torches
made
of
pine
boughs
dipped
in
tar
blazed
at
the
four
corners
of
the
assembly
and
in
the
middle
on
a
boulder
a
man
was
sitting
he
was
speaking
loudly
and
with
passion
but
i
could
not
make
him
out
once
more
shalah
put
his
mouth
to
my
ear
with
a
swift
motion
like
a
snake
and
whispered
the
master
we
crawled
flat
on
our
bellies
round
the
edge
of
the
cup
the
trees
had
gone
and
the
only
cover
was
the
long
grass
and
the
low
sumach
bushes
we
moved
a
foot
at
a
time
and
once
the
indian
turned
in
his
tracks
and
crawled
to
the
left
almost
into
the
open
my
sense
of
smell
as
sharp
almost
as
a
dog
told
me
that
horses
were
picketed
in
the
grass
in
front
of
us
our
road
took
us
within
hearing
of
the
speaker
and
though
i
dared
not
raise
my
head
i
could
hear
the
soft
highland
voice
of
my
friend
he
seemed
now
to
be
speaking
humorously
for
a
laugh
came
from
the
hearers
once
at
the
crossing
of
a
little
brook
i
pulled
a
stone
into
the
water
and
we
instantly
lay
as
still
as
death
but
men
preoccupied
with
their
own
concerns
do
not
keep
anxious
watch
and
our
precautions
were
needless
presently
we
had
come
to
the
far
side
of
the
shelf
abreast
of
the
boulder
on
which
he
sat
who
seemed
to
be
the
chief
figure
now
i
could
raise
my
head
and
what
i
saw
made
my
eyes
dazzle
red
ringan
sat
on
a
stone
with
a
naked
cutlass
across
his
knees
in
front
stood
a
man
the
most
figure
that
i
had
ever
beheld
he
was
short
but
very
sturdily
built
and
wore
a
fine
laced
coat
not
made
for
him
which
hung
to
his
knees
and
was
stretched
tight
at
the
armpits
he
had
a
heavy
pale
face
without
hair
on
it
his
teeth
had
gone
all
but
two
which
stuck
out
at
each
corner
of
his
mouth
giving
him
the
look
of
a
tusker
i
could
see
his
lips
moving
uneasily
in
the
glare
of
the
pine
boughs
and
his
eyes
darted
about
the
company
as
if
seeking
countenance
ringan
was
speaking
very
gravely
with
his
eyes
shining
like
sword
points
the
others
were
every
make
and
manner
of
fellow
from
and
gentlemen
to
loutish
seamen
in
leather
jerkins
some
of
the
faces
were
stained
dark
with
passion
and
crime
some
had
the
air
of
wild
boys
and
some
the
hard
sobriety
of
traders
but
one
and
all
were
held
by
the
dancing
eyes
of
the
man
that
spoke
what
is
the
judgment
he
was
saying
of
the
free
companions
by
the
old
custom
of
the
western
seas
i
call
upon
you
gentlemen
all
for
your
decision
then
i
gathered
that
the
fellow
had
offended
against
some
one
of
their
lawless
laws
and
was
on
his
trial
no
one
spoke
for
a
moment
and
then
one
grizzled
seaman
raised
his
hand
the
dice
must
judge
he
said
he
must
throw
for
his
life
against
the
six
another
exclaimed
against
this
old
wives
folly
he
cried
with
an
oath
let
cosh
go
his
ways
and
swear
to
amend
them
the
brethren
of
the
coast
can
not
be
too
nice
in
these
little
matters
we
are
not
pursy
justices
or
mooning
girls
but
he
had
no
support
the
verdict
was
for
the
dice
and
a
seaman
brought
ringan
a
little
ivory
box
which
he
held
out
to
the
prisoner
the
latter
took
it
with
shaking
hand
as
if
he
did
not
know
how
to
use
it
you
will
cast
thrice
said
ringan
two
even
throws
and
you
are
free
the
man
fumbled
a
little
and
then
cast
it
fell
a
four
a
second
time
he
threw
and
the
dice
lay
five
in
that
wild
place
in
the
black
heart
of
night
the
terror
of
the
thing
fell
on
my
soul
the
savage
faces
the
deadly
purpose
in
eyes
the
fumbling
miscreant
before
him
were
all
heavy
with
horror
i
had
no
doubt
that
cosh
was
worthy
of
death
but
this
cold
and
merciless
treatment
froze
my
reason
i
watched
with
starting
eyes
the
last
throw
and
i
could
not
hear
ringan
declare
it
but
i
saw
by
the
look
on
face
what
it
had
been
it
is
your
privilege
to
choose
your
manner
of
death
and
to
name
your
successor
i
heard
ringan
say
but
cosh
did
not
need
the
invitation
now
that
his
case
was
desperate
the
courage
in
him
revived
he
was
fully
armed
and
in
a
second
he
had
drawn
a
knife
and
leaped
for
ringan
throat
perhaps
he
expected
it
perhaps
he
had
learned
the
art
of
the
wild
beast
so
that
his
body
was
answerable
to
his
swiftest
wish
i
do
not
know
but
i
saw
cosh
knife
crash
on
the
stone
and
splinter
while
ringan
stood
by
his
side
you
have
answered
my
question
he
said
quietly
draw
your
cutlass
man
you
have
maybe
one
chance
in
ten
thousand
for
your
life
i
shut
my
eyes
as
i
heard
the
steel
clash
then
very
soon
came
silence
i
looked
again
and
saw
ringan
wiping
his
blade
on
a
bunch
of
grass
and
a
body
lying
before
him
he
was
speaking
speaking
i
suppose
about
the
successor
to
the
dead
man
whom
two
negroes
had
promptly
removed
suddenly
at
my
shoulder
shalah
gave
the
hoot
of
an
owl
followed
at
a
second
interval
by
a
second
and
a
third
i
suppose
it
was
some
signal
agreed
with
ringan
but
at
the
time
i
thought
the
man
had
gone
mad
i
was
not
very
sane
myself
what
i
had
seen
had
sent
a
cold
grue
through
me
for
i
had
never
before
seen
a
man
die
violently
and
the
circumstances
of
the
place
and
hour
made
the
thing
a
thousandfold
more
awful
i
had
a
black
fright
on
me
at
that
whole
company
of
merciless
men
and
especially
at
ringan
whose
word
was
law
to
them
now
the
worst
effect
of
fear
is
that
it
obscures
good
judgment
and
makes
a
man
in
desperation
do
deeds
of
a
foolhardiness
from
which
at
other
times
he
would
shrink
all
i
remembered
in
that
moment
was
that
i
had
to
reach
ringan
and
that
mercer
had
told
me
that
the
safest
plan
was
to
show
a
bold
front
i
never
remembered
that
i
had
also
been
bidden
to
follow
shalah
nor
did
i
reflect
that
a
secret
conclave
of
pirates
was
no
occasion
to
choose
for
my
meeting
with
a
sudden
impulse
i
forced
myself
to
my
feet
and
stalked
or
rather
shambled
into
the
light
ninian
i
cried
ninian
campbell
i
here
to
claim
your
promise
the
whole
company
turned
on
me
and
i
was
gripped
by
a
dozen
hands
and
flung
on
the
ground
ringan
came
forward
to
look
but
there
was
no
recognition
in
his
eyes
some
one
cried
out
a
spy
and
there
was
a
fierce
murmur
of
voices
which
were
meaningless
to
me
for
fear
had
got
me
again
and
i
had
neither
ears
nor
voice
dimly
it
seemed
that
he
gave
some
order
and
i
was
trussed
up
with
ropes
then
i
was
conscious
of
being
carried
out
of
the
glare
of
torches
into
the
cool
darkness
presently
i
was
laid
in
some
kind
of
carpeted
with
fir
boughs
for
the
needles
tickled
my
face
bit
by
bit
my
senses
came
back
to
me
and
i
caught
hold
of
my
vagrant
courage
a
big
negro
in
seaman
clothes
with
a
scarlet
sash
round
his
middle
was
squatted
on
the
floor
watching
me
by
the
light
of
a
ship
lantern
he
had
a
friendly
foolish
face
and
i
remember
yet
how
he
rolled
his
eyeballs
i
wo
run
away
i
said
so
you
might
slacken
these
ropes
and
let
me
breathe
easy
apparently
he
was
an
accommodating
gaoler
for
he
did
as
i
wished
and
give
me
a
drink
i
said
for
my
tongue
like
a
stick
he
mixed
me
a
pannikin
of
rum
and
water
perhaps
he
hocussed
it
or
maybe
was
only
the
effect
of
spirits
on
a
weary
body
but
three
minutes
after
i
had
drunk
i
was
in
a
heavy
sleep
chapter
ix
various
doings
in
the
savannah
i
awoke
in
broad
daylight
and
when
my
wits
came
back
to
me
i
saw
i
was
in
a
tent
of
skins
with
my
limbs
unbound
and
a
pitcher
of
water
beside
me
placed
by
some
provident
hand
through
the
tent
door
i
looked
over
a
wide
space
of
green
savannah
how
i
had
got
there
i
knew
not
but
as
my
memory
repeated
the
events
of
the
night
i
knew
i
had
travelled
far
for
the
sea
showed
miles
away
at
a
great
distance
beneath
me
on
the
water
i
saw
a
ship
in
full
sail
diminished
to
a
toy
size
careering
northward
with
the
wind
outside
a
man
was
seated
whistling
a
cheerful
tune
i
got
to
my
feet
and
staggered
out
to
clear
my
head
in
the
air
and
found
the
smiling
face
of
ringan
andrew
he
cried
as
i
sat
down
beside
him
have
you
slept
well
i
rubbed
my
eyes
and
took
long
draughts
of
the
morning
breeze
are
you
a
warlock
campbell
that
you
can
spirit
folk
about
the
country
at
your
pleasure
i
have
slept
sound
but
my
dreams
have
been
bad
yes
he
said
what
sort
of
dreams
maybe
i
dreamed
i
was
in
a
wild
place
among
wild
men
and
that
i
saw
murder
done
the
look
of
the
man
who
did
it
was
not
unlike
your
own
you
have
dreamed
true
he
said
gravely
but
you
have
the
wrong
word
for
it
others
would
call
it
justice
what
sort
of
justice
said
i
when
you
had
no
court
or
law
but
just
what
you
made
yourself
is
it
not
a
stiff
whiggamore
he
said
looking
skywards
why
man
all
justice
is
what
men
make
themselves
what
hinders
the
free
companions
from
making
as
honest
laws
as
any
cackling
council
in
the
towns
did
you
see
the
man
cosh
have
you
heard
anything
of
his
doings
and
will
you
deny
that
the
world
was
well
quit
of
him
there
a
decency
in
all
trades
and
cosh
fair
stank
to
heaven
but
i
glad
the
thing
ended
as
it
did
i
never
get
to
like
a
cold
execution
was
better
for
everybody
that
he
should
fly
at
my
face
and
get
six
inches
of
kindly
steel
in
his
throat
he
had
a
gentleman
death
which
was
more
than
his
crimes
warranted
i
was
only
half
convinced
here
was
i
a
merchant
pitchforked
suddenly
into
a
world
of
lawlessness
i
could
not
be
expected
to
adjust
my
views
in
the
short
space
of
a
night
you
gave
me
a
rough
handling
i
said
where
was
the
need
of
it
and
you
showed
very
little
sense
in
bursting
in
on
us
the
way
you
did
could
you
not
have
bided
quietly
till
shalah
gave
the
word
i
had
to
be
harsh
with
you
or
they
would
have
suspected
something
and
cut
your
throat
yon
gentry
are
not
to
take
liberties
with
what
made
you
do
it
andrew
just
that
i
was
black
afraid
that
made
me
more
feared
of
being
a
coward
so
i
forced
myself
to
yon
folly
a
very
honourable
reason
he
said
are
you
the
leader
of
those
men
i
asked
they
looked
a
scurvy
lot
do
you
call
that
a
proper
occupation
for
the
best
blood
in
breadalbane
it
was
a
silly
speech
and
i
could
have
bitten
my
tongue
out
when
i
had
uttered
it
but
i
was
in
a
vile
temper
for
the
dregs
of
the
rum
still
hummed
in
my
blood
his
face
grew
dark
till
he
looked
like
the
man
i
had
seen
the
night
before
i
allow
no
man
to
slight
my
race
he
said
in
a
harsh
voice
it
the
truth
whether
you
like
it
or
not
and
you
that
claimed
to
be
a
gentleman
what
is
it
they
say
about
the
highlands
and
i
quoted
a
ribald
glasgow
proverb
what
moved
me
to
this
insolence
i
can
not
say
i
was
in
the
wrong
and
i
knew
it
but
i
was
too
much
of
a
child
to
let
go
my
silly
pride
ringan
got
up
very
quickly
and
walked
three
steps
the
blackness
had
gone
from
his
face
and
it
was
puzzled
and
melancholy
there
a
precious
lot
of
the
bairn
in
you
garvald
he
said
and
an
ugly
spice
of
the
whiggamore
i
would
have
killed
another
man
for
half
your
words
and
i
got
to
make
you
pay
for
them
somehow
and
he
knit
his
brow
and
pondered
i
ready
said
i
with
the
best
bravado
i
could
muster
though
the
truth
is
i
was
sick
at
heart
i
had
forced
a
quarrel
like
an
boy
on
the
very
man
whose
help
i
had
come
to
seek
and
i
saw
too
that
i
had
gone
just
that
bit
too
far
for
which
no
recantation
would
win
pardon
what
sort
of
way
are
you
ready
he
asked
politely
you
would
fight
me
with
your
pistols
but
you
have
got
them
and
this
is
no
a
matter
that
will
wait
i
could
spit
you
in
a
jiffy
with
my
sword
but
it
wouldna
be
fair
it
strikes
me
that
you
and
me
are
ill
matched
like
a
shark
and
a
wolf
that
can
not
meet
to
fight
in
the
same
element
then
he
ran
his
finger
down
the
buttons
of
his
coat
and
his
eyes
were
smiling
we
try
the
old
way
that
laddies
use
on
the
village
green
man
andrew
i
going
to
skelp
you
as
your
mother
skelped
you
when
you
were
a
breechless
bairn
and
he
tossed
his
coat
on
the
grass
i
could
only
follow
suit
though
i
was
black
ashamed
at
the
whole
business
i
felt
the
disgrace
of
my
conduct
and
most
bitterly
the
disgrace
of
the
penalty
my
arm
was
too
short
to
make
a
fighter
of
me
and
i
could
only
strive
to
close
that
i
might
get
the
use
of
my
weight
and
my
great
strength
of
neck
and
shoulder
ringan
danced
round
me
tapping
me
lightly
on
nose
and
cheek
but
hard
enough
to
make
the
blood
flow
i
defended
myself
as
best
i
could
while
my
temper
rose
rapidly
and
made
me
forget
my
penitence
time
and
again
i
looked
for
a
chance
to
slip
in
but
he
was
as
wary
as
a
fox
and
was
a
yard
off
before
i
could
get
my
arm
round
him
at
last
in
extreme
vexation
i
lowered
my
head
and
rushed
blindly
for
his
chest
something
like
the
sails
of
a
windmill
smote
me
on
the
jaw
and
i
felt
myself
falling
into
a
pit
of
great
darkness
where
little
lights
twinkled
the
next
i
knew
i
was
sitting
propped
against
the
with
a
cold
bandage
round
my
forehead
and
ringan
with
a
napkin
bathing
my
face
cheer
up
man
he
cried
you
got
off
light
for
there
no
a
scratch
on
your
cheek
and
the
from
the
nose
will
clear
out
the
dregs
of
moro
hocus
i
blinked
a
little
and
tried
to
recall
what
had
happened
all
my
had
gone
and
i
was
now
in
a
hurry
to
set
myself
right
with
my
conscience
he
heard
my
apology
with
an
embarrassed
face
say
no
more
andrew
i
was
as
muckle
to
blame
as
you
and
i
been
giving
myself
some
ill
names
for
that
last
trick
it
was
ower
hard
but
man
the
temptation
was
sore
he
elbowed
me
to
the
open
air
now
for
the
questions
you
a
right
to
ask
we
of
the
brethren
have
not
precisely
a
chief
as
you
call
it
but
there
are
not
many
of
them
would
gainsay
my
word
why
you
ask
well
it
not
for
a
modest
man
to
be
sounding
his
own
trumpet
maybe
it
because
i
a
gentleman
and
there
that
in
good
blood
which
awes
the
commonalty
maybe
because
i
no
fish
of
my
own
to
fry
i
do
not
rob
for
greed
like
calvert
and
williams
or
kill
for
lust
like
the
departed
cosh
to
me
it
a
game
which
i
play
by
honest
rules
i
never
laid
finger
on
a
bodle
worth
of
english
stuff
and
if
now
and
then
i
ease
the
dons
of
a
pickle
silver
or
send
a
frenchman
or
two
to
purgatory
what
worse
am
i
doing
than
his
majesty
troops
in
flanders
or
your
black
frigates
that
lie
off
port
royal
if
i
a
clear
conscience
i
can
more
easily
take
order
with
those
that
are
less
but
maybe
the
chief
reason
is
that
i
some
little
skill
of
arms
so
that
the
lad
that
questions
me
is
apt
to
fare
like
cosh
there
was
a
kind
of
boastful
sincerity
about
the
man
which
convinced
me
but
his
words
put
me
in
mind
of
my
own
business
i
came
seeking
you
to
ask
help
your
friends
have
been
making
too
free
with
my
belongings
i
would
never
complain
if
it
were
the
common
risk
of
my
trade
but
i
have
a
notion
that
there
some
sort
of
design
behind
it
then
i
told
him
of
my
strife
with
the
english
merchants
what
are
your
losses
he
asked
the
ayr
brig
was
taken
off
cape
charles
and
burned
to
the
water
god
help
the
poor
souls
in
her
for
i
fear
they
perished
he
nodded
i
know
that
was
one
of
cosh
exploits
he
has
paid
by
now
for
that
and
other
things
two
of
my
ships
were
chased
through
the
capes
and
far
up
the
tidewater
of
the
james
not
two
months
back
i
went
on
he
laughed
i
did
that
myself
he
said
astonishment
and
wrath
filled
me
but
i
finished
my
tale
a
week
ago
there
was
a
ship
ashore
on
accomac
pirates
boarded
her
but
they
took
nothing
away
save
a
sum
of
gold
that
was
mine
was
that
your
doing
also
mr
campbell
yes
he
said
but
the
money
safe
i
give
you
a
line
to
mercer
and
he
pay
it
you
i
much
obliged
to
you
campbell
i
said
choking
with
anger
but
who
in
heaven
name
asked
you
to
manage
my
business
i
thought
you
were
my
friend
and
i
came
to
you
as
such
and
here
i
find
you
the
chief
among
my
enemies
patience
andrew
he
said
and
i
explain
everything
for
i
grant
you
it
needs
some
explaining
first
you
are
right
about
the
english
merchants
they
and
the
free
companions
have
long
had
an
understanding
and
word
was
sent
by
them
to
play
tricks
on
your
ships
i
was
absent
at
the
time
and
though
the
thing
was
dirty
work
as
any
one
could
see
some
of
the
fools
thought
it
a
fair
ploy
and
cosh
was
suffered
to
do
his
will
when
i
got
back
i
heard
the
story
and
was
black
angry
so
i
took
the
matter
into
my
own
keeping
i
have
ways
and
means
of
getting
the
news
of
virginia
and
i
know
pretty
well
what
you
have
been
doing
young
one
there
spirit
in
you
and
some
wise
notions
but
you
want
help
in
the
game
besides
there
a
bigger
thing
before
you
so
i
took
steps
to
bring
you
here
you
took
a
roundabout
road
said
i
by
no
means
appeased
it
had
to
be
think
i
could
come
marching
into
james
town
and
collogue
with
you
in
your
now
that
you
here
you
have
my
sworn
word
that
the
free
companions
will
never
lay
hand
again
on
your
ventures
will
that
content
you
it
will
i
said
but
you
spoke
of
a
bigger
thing
before
me
yes
and
that
the
price
you
are
going
to
pay
me
for
my
goodwill
it
what
the
lawyers
call
for
our
bargain
and
it
the
reason
i
brought
you
here
tell
me
andrew
ken
a
man
frew
who
lives
on
the
south
fork
river
a
north
ireland
fellow
with
a
hatchet
face
and
a
big
scar
i
saw
him
a
year
ago
it
stuck
in
my
mind
that
you
had
and
mind
the
advice
he
gave
you
i
remembered
it
very
well
for
it
was
frew
who
had
clinched
my
views
on
the
defencelessness
of
our
west
he
spoke
god
truth
i
said
but
i
can
not
get
a
virginian
to
believe
it
they
believe
in
time
he
said
though
maybe
too
late
to
save
some
of
their
scalps
come
to
this
hillock
and
i
will
show
you
something
from
the
low
swell
of
ground
we
looked
west
to
some
little
hills
and
in
the
hollow
of
them
a
spire
of
smoke
rose
into
the
blue
i
going
to
take
you
there
that
you
may
hear
and
see
something
to
your
profit
quick
moro
he
cried
to
a
servant
bring
food
and
have
the
horses
saddled
we
breakfasted
on
some
very
good
beefsteaks
and
started
at
a
canter
for
the
hills
my
headache
had
gone
and
i
was
now
in
a
contented
frame
of
mind
for
i
saw
the
purpose
of
my
errand
accomplished
and
i
had
a
young
man
eagerness
to
know
what
lay
before
me
as
we
rode
ringan
talked
you
have
heard
tell
of
bacon
rising
in
governor
berkeley
had
ridden
the
dominion
with
too
harsh
a
hand
and
in
the
matter
of
its
defence
against
the
indians
he
was
slack
when
he
should
have
been
tight
the
upshot
was
that
nathaniel
bacon
took
up
the
job
himself
and
after
giving
the
indians
their
lesson
turned
his
mind
to
the
government
of
virginia
he
drove
berkeley
into
accomac
and
would
have
turned
the
whole
place
tapsalteery
if
he
had
not
suddenly
died
of
a
bowel
complaint
after
that
berkeley
and
his
tame
planters
got
the
upper
hand
and
there
were
some
pretty
homings
and
hangings
there
were
two
men
that
were
lieutenants
to
bacon
and
maybe
put
the
notion
into
his
head
one
was
james
drummond
a
cousin
of
my
own
mother
and
he
got
the
gallows
for
his
trouble
the
other
was
a
man
richard
lawrence
a
fine
scholar
and
a
grand
hand
at
planning
though
a
little
slow
in
a
fight
he
kept
the
ordinary
at
james
town
and
was
the
one
that
collected
the
powder
and
kindled
the
fuse
governor
berkeley
had
a
long
score
to
settle
with
him
but
he
never
got
him
for
when
the
thing
was
past
hope
richard
rode
west
one
snowy
night
to
the
hills
and
virginia
saw
him
no
more
they
think
he
starved
in
the
wilderness
or
got
into
the
hands
of
the
wild
indians
and
is
long
ago
dead
i
knew
all
about
dick
lawrence
for
i
had
heard
the
tale
twenty
times
but
surely
they
right
i
said
it
fifteen
years
since
any
man
had
word
of
him
well
you
see
him
within
an
hour
said
ringan
it
a
queer
story
but
it
seems
he
fell
in
with
a
monacan
war
party
and
since
he
and
bacon
had
been
fighting
their
deadly
foes
the
susquehannocks
they
treated
him
well
and
brought
him
south
into
carolina
you
must
know
andrew
that
all
this
land
hereaways
except
for
the
little
algonquin
villages
on
the
shore
is
sioux
country
with
as
many
tribes
as
there
are
houses
in
clan
campbell
but
cheek
by
jowl
is
a
long
strip
held
by
the
tuscaroras
a
murdering
lot
of
devils
of
whom
you
and
i
get
news
sooner
than
we
want
the
tuscaroras
are
bad
enough
in
themselves
but
the
worst
part
is
that
all
the
back
country
in
the
hills
belongs
to
their
cousins
the
cherokees
and
god
knows
how
far
north
their
sway
holds
the
long
house
of
the
iroquois
controls
everything
west
of
the
coast
land
from
carolina
away
up
through
virginia
to
new
york
and
the
canadas
that
means
that
virginia
has
on
two
sides
the
most
powerful
tribes
of
savages
in
the
world
and
if
ever
the
iroquois
found
a
general
and
made
a
common
attack
things
would
go
ill
with
the
tidewater
i
tell
you
that
so
that
you
can
understand
doings
he
hates
the
iroquois
like
hell
and
so
he
likes
their
enemies
he
has
lived
for
fifteen
years
among
the
sioux
whiles
with
the
catawbas
whiles
with
the
manahoacs
but
mostly
with
the
monacans
we
of
the
free
companions
see
him
pretty
often
and
bring
him
the
news
and
little
comforts
like
good
tobacco
and
de
that
he
can
not
get
among
savages
and
we
carry
messages
between
him
and
the
tidewater
for
he
has
many
friends
still
alive
there
there
no
man
ever
had
his
knowledge
of
indians
and
i
taking
you
to
him
for
he
has
something
to
tell
you
by
this
time
we
had
come
to
a
place
where
a
burn
issued
from
a
shallow
glen
in
the
savannah
there
was
a
peeled
wand
stuck
in
a
burnt
tree
above
the
water
and
this
ringan
took
and
broke
very
carefully
into
two
equal
pieces
and
put
them
back
in
the
hole
from
this
point
onwards
i
had
the
feeling
that
the
long
grass
and
the
clumps
of
bushes
held
watchers
they
made
no
noise
but
i
could
have
sworn
to
the
truth
of
my
notion
ringan
whose
senses
were
keener
than
mine
would
stop
every
now
and
again
and
raise
his
hand
as
if
in
signal
at
one
place
we
halted
dead
for
five
minutes
and
at
another
he
dismounted
and
cut
a
tuft
of
sumach
which
he
laid
over
his
saddle
then
at
the
edge
of
a
thicket
he
stopped
again
and
held
up
both
hands
above
his
head
instantly
a
tall
indian
stepped
from
the
cover
saluted
and
walked
by
our
side
in
five
minutes
more
we
rounded
a
creek
of
the
burn
and
were
at
the
encampment
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
seen
an
indian
village
the
tents
or
teepees
were
of
skins
stretched
over
poles
and
not
of
bark
like
those
of
the
woodland
tribes
at
a
great
fire
in
the
centre
women
were
grilling
deer
flesh
while
little
brown
children
strove
and
quarrelled
for
scraps
i
saw
few
men
for
the
braves
were
out
hunting
or
keeping
watch
at
the
approaches
one
young
lad
took
the
horses
and
led
us
to
a
teepee
bigger
than
the
others
outside
of
which
stood
a
savage
with
heron
feathers
in
his
hair
and
a
necklace
of
polished
shells
on
his
iron
face
there
was
no
flicker
of
welcome
or
recognition
but
he
shook
hands
silently
with
the
two
of
us
and
struck
a
blow
on
a
dry
gourd
instantly
three
warriors
appeared
and
took
their
place
by
his
side
then
all
of
us
sat
down
and
a
pipe
was
lit
and
handed
by
the
chief
to
ringan
he
took
a
puff
and
gave
it
to
one
of
the
other
indians
who
handed
it
to
me
with
that
ceremony
over
the
tongue
of
the
chief
seemed
to
be
unloosed
the
sachem
comes
he
said
and
an
old
man
sat
himself
down
beside
us
he
was
a
strange
figure
to
meet
in
an
indian
camp
a
long
white
beard
hung
down
to
his
middle
and
his
unshorn
hair
draped
his
shoulders
like
a
fleece
his
clothing
was
of
tanned
skin
save
that
he
had
a
belt
of
spanish
leather
and
on
his
feet
he
wore
country
shoes
and
not
the
indian
moccasins
the
eyes
in
his
head
were
keen
and
youthful
and
though
he
could
not
have
been
less
than
sixty
he
carried
himself
with
the
vigour
of
a
man
in
his
prime
below
his
shaggy
locks
was
a
high
broad
forehead
such
as
some
college
professor
might
have
borne
who
had
given
all
his
days
to
the
philosophies
he
seemed
to
have
been
disturbed
in
reading
for
he
carried
in
his
hand
a
little
book
with
a
finger
marking
his
place
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
title
and
saw
that
it
was
locke
new
essay
on
the
human
understanding
ringan
spoke
to
the
chief
in
his
own
tongue
but
the
sioux
language
was
beyond
me
lawrence
joined
in
and
i
saw
the
indian
eyes
kindle
he
shook
his
head
and
seemed
to
deny
something
then
he
poured
forth
a
flood
of
talk
and
when
he
had
finished
ringan
spoke
to
me
he
says
that
the
tuscaroras
are
stirring
word
has
come
down
from
the
hills
to
be
ready
for
a
great
ride
between
the
moon
of
stags
and
the
corngathering
lawrence
nodded
that
an
old
tuscarora
habit
but
somehow
these
ridings
never
happen
he
said
something
in
sioux
to
one
of
the
warriors
and
got
an
emphatic
answer
which
he
translated
to
me
he
thinks
that
the
cherokees
have
had
word
from
farther
north
it
looks
like
a
general
stirring
of
the
long
house
is
it
the
fighting
in
canada
i
asked
god
knows
he
said
but
i
do
think
so
if
that
were
the
cause
we
should
have
the
iroquois
pushed
down
on
the
top
of
the
cherokees
but
my
information
is
that
the
cherokees
are
to
move
north
themselves
and
then
down
to
the
tidewater
it
is
not
likely
that
the
five
nations
have
any
plan
of
conquering
the
lowlands
they
a
hill
people
and
they
know
the
white
man
mettle
too
well
my
notion
is
that
some
devilry
is
going
on
in
the
west
and
i
might
guess
that
there
a
white
man
in
it
he
spoke
to
the
chief
who
spoke
again
to
his
companion
and
lawrence
listened
with
contracting
brows
while
ringan
whistled
between
his
teeth
they
got
a
queer
story
said
lawrence
at
last
they
say
that
when
last
they
hunted
on
the
roanoke
their
young
men
brought
a
tale
that
a
tribe
of
cherokees
who
lived
six
days
journey
into
the
hills
had
found
a
great
sachem
who
had
the
white
man
magic
and
that
god
was
moving
him
to
drive
out
the
palefaces
and
hold
his
hunting
lodge
in
their
dwellings
that
is
not
like
an
ordinary
indian
lie
what
do
you
make
of
it
mr
campbell
ringan
looked
grave
it
possible
enough
there
a
heap
of
renegades
among
the
tribes
men
that
have
made
the
tidewater
and
even
the
free
companies
too
warm
for
them
there
no
knowing
the
mischief
a
rascal
might
work
i
mind
a
man
at
norfolk
a
scots
redemptioner
who
had
the
tongue
of
a
devil
and
the
strength
of
a
wolf
he
broke
out
one
night
and
got
clear
into
the
wilderness
lawrence
turned
to
me
briskly
you
see
the
case
sir
there
trouble
brewing
in
the
hills
black
trouble
for
virginia
but
we
some
months
breathing
space
for
nat
bacon
sake
i
loath
to
see
the
war
paint
at
james
town
the
question
is
are
you
willing
to
do
your
share
i
willing
enough
i
said
but
what
can
i
do
i
not
exactly
a
popular
character
in
the
tidewater
if
you
want
me
to
hammer
sense
into
the
planters
you
could
not
get
a
worse
man
for
the
job
i
have
told
governor
nicholson
my
fears
and
he
is
of
my
opinion
but
his
hands
are
tied
by
a
penurious
council
if
he
can
not
screw
money
for
troops
out
of
the
virginians
it
not
likely
that
i
could
do
much
lawrence
nodded
his
wise
head
all
you
say
is
true
but
i
want
a
different
kind
of
service
from
you
you
may
have
noticed
in
your
travels
garvald
for
they
tell
me
you
are
not
often
out
of
the
saddle
that
up
and
down
the
land
there
a
good
few
folk
that
are
not
very
easy
in
their
minds
many
of
these
are
former
troopers
of
bacon
some
are
new
men
who
have
eyes
in
their
heads
some
are
old
settlers
who
have
been
soured
by
the
folly
of
the
government
with
such
poor
means
as
i
possess
i
keep
in
touch
with
these
gentlemen
and
in
them
we
have
the
rudiments
of
a
frontier
army
i
do
say
they
are
many
but
five
hundred
resolute
fellows
well
horsed
and
well
armed
and
led
by
some
man
who
knows
the
indian
ways
might
be
a
in
the
way
of
an
iroquois
raid
but
to
perfect
this
force
needs
time
and
above
all
it
needs
a
man
on
the
spot
for
virginia
is
not
a
healthy
place
for
me
and
these
savannahs
are
a
trifle
distant
i
want
a
man
in
james
town
who
will
receive
word
when
i
send
it
and
pass
it
onto
those
who
should
hear
it
i
want
a
discreet
man
whose
trade
takes
him
about
the
country
campbell
tells
me
you
are
such
an
one
will
you
accept
the
charge
i
was
greatly
flattered
but
a
little
perplexed
i
a
citizen
i
said
and
i
can
have
no
hand
in
rebellions
i
no
ambition
to
play
bacon
part
lawrence
smiled
a
proof
of
your
discretion
sir
but
believe
me
there
is
no
thought
of
rebellion
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
council
and
less
with
his
majesty
governor
we
but
seek
to
set
the
house
in
order
against
perils
which
we
alone
know
fully
i
approve
of
your
scruples
and
i
give
you
my
word
they
shall
not
be
violated
so
be
it
i
said
i
will
do
what
i
can
god
be
praised
said
lawrence
i
have
here
certain
secret
papers
which
will
give
you
the
names
of
the
men
we
can
trust
messages
will
come
to
you
which
i
trust
you
to
find
the
means
of
sending
on
mercer
has
our
confidence
and
will
arrange
with
you
certain
matters
of
arms
he
will
also
supply
you
with
what
money
is
needed
there
are
many
in
the
tidewater
who
would
look
askance
at
this
business
so
it
must
be
done
in
desperate
secrecy
but
if
there
should
be
trouble
i
counsel
you
to
play
a
bold
hand
with
the
governor
they
tell
me
that
you
and
he
are
friendly
and
unless
i
mistake
the
man
he
can
see
reason
if
he
is
wisely
handled
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
you
can
take
nicholson
into
your
confidence
how
long
have
we
to
prepare
i
asked
the
summer
months
according
to
my
forecast
it
may
be
shorter
or
longer
but
i
will
know
better
when
i
get
nearer
the
hills
and
what
about
the
carolina
tribes
i
asked
if
we
are
to
hold
the
western
marches
of
virginia
we
can
not
risk
being
caught
on
the
flank
that
can
be
arranged
he
said
our
friends
the
sioux
are
not
of
the
long
house
if
the
tuscaroras
ride
i
do
not
think
they
will
ever
reach
the
james
the
afternoon
was
now
ending
and
we
were
given
a
meal
of
and
roast
deer
flesh
then
we
took
our
leave
and
lawrence
last
word
to
me
was
to
send
him
any
english
books
of
a
serious
cast
which
came
under
my
eye
this
request
he
made
with
so
much
hesitation
but
with
so
hungry
a
desire
in
his
face
that
i
was
moved
to
pity
this
scholar
wandering
in
indian
lodges
and
famished
for
lack
of
the
society
of
his
kind
ringan
took
me
by
a
new
way
which
bore
north
of
that
we
had
ridden
and
though
the
dusk
began
soon
to
fall
he
never
faltered
in
his
guiding
presently
we
left
the
savannah
for
the
woods
of
the
coast
and
dropping
down
hill
by
a
very
meagre
path
we
came
in
three
hours
to
a
creek
of
the
sea
there
by
a
little
fire
we
found
shalah
and
the
sloop
riding
at
anchor
below
a
thick
covert
of
trees
to
you
andrew
cried
ringan
you
be
getting
news
of
me
soon
and
maybe
see
me
in
the
flesh
on
the
tidewater
remember
the
word
i
told
you
in
the
saltmarket
for
i
never
mention
names
when
i
take
the
road
chapter
i
hear
an
old
song
when
we
sailed
at
daybreak
next
morning
i
had
the
glow
of
satisfaction
with
my
own
doings
which
is
a
safe
precursor
of
misfortunes
i
had
settled
my
business
with
the
free
companions
and
need
look
for
no
more
trouble
on
that
score
but
what
tickled
my
vanity
was
my
talk
with
ringan
and
lawrence
at
the
monacan
lodge
and
the
momentous
trust
they
had
laid
on
me
with
a
young
man
vanity
i
saw
myself
the
saviour
of
virginia
and
hailed
as
such
by
the
proud
folk
who
now
scorned
me
my
only
merits
as
i
was
to
learn
in
time
are
a
certain
grasp
of
simple
truths
that
elude
cleverer
men
and
a
desperate
obstinacy
which
is
reluctant
to
admit
defeat
but
it
is
the
fashion
of
youth
to
glory
in
what
it
lacks
and
i
flattered
myself
that
i
had
a
natural
gift
for
finesse
and
subtlety
and
was
a
born
deviser
of
wars
again
and
again
i
told
myself
how
i
and
lawrence
virginians
grown
under
my
hand
to
a
potent
army
should
roll
back
the
invaders
to
the
hills
and
beyond
while
the
sioux
of
the
carolinas
guarded
one
flank
and
the
streams
of
the
potomac
the
other
in
those
days
the
star
of
the
great
marlborough
had
not
risen
but
john
churchill
the
victor
of
blenheim
did
not
esteem
himself
a
wiser
strategist
than
the
raw
lad
andrew
garvald
now
sailing
north
in
the
long
wash
of
the
atlantic
seas
the
weather
grew
spiteful
and
we
were
much
buffeted
about
by
the
contrary
spring
winds
so
that
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
that
we
turned
cape
henry
and
came
into
the
bay
of
chesapeake
here
a
perfect
hurricane
fell
upon
us
and
we
sought
refuge
in
a
creek
on
the
shore
of
norfolk
county
the
place
was
marshy
and
it
was
hard
to
find
dry
land
for
our
night
lodging
our
provisions
had
run
low
and
there
seemed
little
enough
for
two
hungry
men
who
had
all
day
been
striving
with
salt
winds
so
knowing
that
this
was
a
neighbourhood
studded
with
great
manors
and
remembering
the
hospitality
i
had
so
often
found
i
left
shalah
by
the
fire
with
such
food
as
remained
and
set
out
with
our
lantern
through
the
woods
to
look
for
a
human
habitation
i
found
one
quicker
than
i
had
hoped
almost
at
once
i
came
on
a
track
which
led
me
into
a
and
out
of
the
thickets
to
a
big
clearing
the
daylight
had
not
yet
wholly
gone
and
it
guided
me
to
two
from
which
an
avenue
of
chestnut
trees
led
up
to
a
great
house
there
were
lights
glimmering
in
the
windows
and
when
i
reached
the
yard
and
saw
the
size
of
the
barns
and
outbuildings
i
wished
i
had
happened
on
a
place
of
less
pretensions
but
hunger
made
me
bold
and
i
tramped
over
the
mown
grass
of
the
yard
which
in
the
dusk
i
could
see
to
be
set
with
till
i
stood
before
the
door
of
as
fine
a
mansion
as
i
had
found
in
the
dominion
from
within
came
a
sound
of
speech
and
laughter
and
i
was
in
half
a
mind
to
turn
back
to
my
cold
quarters
by
the
shore
i
had
no
sooner
struck
the
knocker
than
i
wanted
to
run
away
the
door
was
opened
instantly
by
a
tall
negro
in
a
scarlet
livery
he
asked
no
questions
but
motioned
me
to
enter
as
if
i
had
been
an
invited
guest
i
followed
him
wondering
dolefully
what
sort
of
figure
i
must
cut
in
my
plain
clothes
soaked
and
stained
by
travel
for
it
was
clear
that
i
had
lighted
on
the
mansion
of
some
rich
planter
who
was
even
now
entertaining
his
friends
the
servant
led
me
through
an
outer
hall
into
a
great
room
full
of
people
a
few
candles
in
tall
candlesticks
burned
down
the
length
of
a
table
round
which
sat
a
score
of
gentlemen
the
scarlet
negro
went
to
the
tablehead
and
said
something
to
the
master
who
rose
and
came
to
meet
me
i
am
i
said
humbly
and
i
left
my
boat
on
the
shore
and
came
inland
to
look
for
a
supper
you
shall
get
it
he
said
heartily
sit
down
and
my
servants
will
bring
you
what
you
need
but
i
am
not
fit
to
intrude
sir
a
weary
traveller
is
no
guest
for
such
a
table
tush
man
he
cried
when
did
a
virginian
think
the
worse
of
a
man
for
his
clothes
sit
down
and
say
no
more
you
are
heartily
welcome
he
pushed
me
into
a
vacant
chair
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
and
gave
some
orders
to
the
negro
now
i
knew
where
i
was
for
i
had
seen
before
the
noble
figure
of
my
host
this
was
colonel
beverley
who
in
his
youth
had
ridden
with
prince
rupert
and
had
come
to
virginia
long
ago
in
the
commonwealth
time
he
sat
on
the
council
and
was
the
most
respected
of
all
the
magnates
of
the
dominion
for
he
had
restrained
the
folly
of
successive
governors
and
had
ever
teen
ready
to
stand
forth
alike
on
behalf
of
the
liberties
of
the
settlers
and
their
duties
to
the
crown
his
name
was
highly
esteemed
at
whitehall
and
more
than
once
he
had
occupied
the
governor
place
when
his
majesty
was
slow
in
filling
it
his
riches
were
large
but
he
was
above
all
things
a
great
gentleman
who
had
grafted
on
an
old
proud
stock
the
tolerance
and
vigour
of
a
new
land
the
company
had
finished
dining
for
the
table
was
covered
with
fruits
and
comfits
and
wine
in
silver
goblets
there
was
sack
and
madeira
and
french
claret
and
white
rhenish
and
ale
and
cider
for
those
with
homelier
palates
i
saw
dimly
around
me
the
faces
of
the
guests
for
the
few
candles
scarcely
illumined
the
dusk
of
the
great
panelled
hall
hung
with
dark
portraits
one
man
gave
me
but
as
i
sat
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
table
i
was
out
of
the
circle
of
the
company
they
talked
and
laughed
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
hear
voices
at
the
other
end
meantime
i
was
busy
with
my
viands
and
no
man
ever
punished
a
venison
pie
more
heartily
as
i
ate
and
drank
i
smiled
at
the
strangeness
of
my
fortunes
to
come
thus
straight
from
the
wild
seas
and
the
company
of
outlaws
into
a
place
of
silver
and
damask
and
satin
coats
and
lace
cravats
and
orderly
wigs
the
soft
hum
of
gentlefolks
speech
was
all
around
me
those
smooth
virginian
voices
compared
with
which
my
scots
tongue
was
as
strident
as
a
raven
but
as
i
listened
i
remembered
ringan
and
lawrence
and
ah
my
silken
friends
thought
i
little
you
know
the
judgment
that
is
preparing
some
day
soon
unless
god
is
kind
there
will
be
blood
on
the
lace
and
the
in
these
pleasant
chambers
then
a
voice
said
louder
than
the
rest
dulcinea
will
sing
to
us
she
promised
this
morning
in
the
garden
at
this
there
was
a
ripple
of
bravas
and
presently
i
heard
the
tuning
of
a
lute
the
low
twanging
went
on
for
a
little
and
suddenly
i
was
seized
with
a
presentiment
i
set
down
my
tankard
and
waited
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
very
clear
and
pure
the
voice
rose
as
fresh
as
the
morning
song
of
birds
there
was
youth
in
it
and
joy
and
pride
joy
of
the
fairness
of
the
earth
pride
of
beauty
and
race
and
strength
dear
and
only
it
sang
as
it
had
sung
before
but
then
it
had
been
a
hope
and
now
it
was
a
woman
certainty
at
the
first
note
the
past
came
back
to
me
like
yesterday
i
saw
the
moorland
gables
in
the
rain
i
heard
the
swirl
of
the
tempest
i
saw
the
elfin
face
in
the
hood
which
had
cheered
the
traveller
on
his
way
in
that
dim
light
i
could
not
see
the
singer
but
i
needed
no
vision
the
strangeness
of
the
thing
clutched
at
my
heart
for
here
was
the
voice
which
had
never
been
out
of
my
ears
singing
again
in
a
land
far
from
the
wet
heather
and
the
driving
mists
of
home
as
i
sat
dazed
and
dreaming
i
knew
that
a
great
thing
had
befallen
me
for
me
andrew
garvald
the
prosaic
trader
coming
out
of
the
darkness
into
this
strange
company
the
foundations
of
the
world
had
been
upset
all
my
cares
and
hopes
my
gains
and
losses
seemed
in
that
moment
no
better
than
dust
love
had
come
to
me
like
a
hurricane
from
now
i
had
but
the
one
ambition
to
hear
that
voice
say
to
me
and
to
mean
it
truly
my
dear
and
only
love
i
knew
it
was
folly
and
a
dream
for
i
felt
most
deeply
my
common
clay
what
had
i
to
offer
for
the
heart
of
that
proud
lady
a
dingy
and
battered
merchant
might
as
well
enter
a
court
of
heroes
and
contend
for
the
love
of
a
queen
but
i
was
not
downcast
i
do
not
think
i
even
wanted
to
hope
it
was
enough
to
know
that
so
bright
a
thing
was
in
the
world
for
at
one
stroke
my
drab
horizon
seemed
to
have
broadened
into
the
infinite
heavens
the
song
ended
in
another
chorus
of
bravas
bring
twenty
candles
pompey
my
host
called
out
and
the
great
we
will
pledge
my
lady
in
the
old
beverley
brew
servants
set
on
the
table
a
massive
silver
dish
into
which
sundry
bottles
of
wine
and
spirits
were
poured
a
mass
of
cut
fruit
and
sugar
was
added
and
the
whole
was
set
alight
and
leaped
almost
to
the
ceiling
in
a
blue
flame
colonel
beverley
with
a
long
ladle
filled
the
array
of
glasses
on
a
salver
which
the
servants
carried
round
to
the
guests
large
branching
candelabra
had
meantime
been
placed
on
the
table
and
in
a
glow
of
light
we
stood
to
our
feet
and
honoured
the
toast
as
i
stood
up
and
looked
to
the
table
end
i
saw
the
dark
restless
eyes
and
the
heavy
blue
jowl
of
governor
nicholson
he
saw
me
for
i
was
alone
at
the
bottom
end
and
when
we
were
seated
he
cried
out
to
me
what
news
of
trade
garvald
you
an
active
packman
for
they
tell
me
you
never
off
the
road
at
the
mention
of
my
name
every
eye
turned
towards
me
and
i
felt
rather
than
saw
the
disfavour
of
the
looks
no
doubt
they
resented
a
storekeeper
intrusion
into
company
and
some
were
there
who
had
publicly
cursed
me
for
a
meddlesome
upstart
but
i
was
not
looking
their
way
but
at
the
girl
who
sat
on
my
host
right
hand
and
in
whose
dark
eyes
i
thought
i
saw
a
spark
of
recognition
she
was
clad
in
white
satin
and
in
her
hair
and
bosom
spring
flowers
had
been
set
her
little
hand
played
with
the
slim
glass
and
her
eyes
had
all
the
happy
freedom
of
childhood
but
now
she
was
a
grown
woman
with
a
woman
pride
and
knowledge
of
power
her
exquisite
slimness
and
grace
amid
the
glow
of
silks
and
silver
gave
her
the
air
of
a
princess
there
was
a
grave
man
in
black
sat
next
her
to
whom
she
bent
to
speak
then
she
looked
towards
me
again
and
smiled
with
that
witching
mockery
which
had
pricked
my
temper
in
the
canongate
tolbooth
the
governor
voice
recalled
me
from
my
dream
how
goes
the
indian
menace
mr
garvald
he
cried
you
must
know
and
he
turned
to
the
company
that
our
friend
combines
commerce
with
high
policy
and
shares
my
apprehensions
as
to
the
safety
of
the
dominion
i
could
not
tell
whether
he
was
mocking
at
me
or
not
i
think
he
was
for
francis
nicholson
moods
were
as
mutable
as
the
tides
in
every
word
of
his
there
lurked
some
sour
irony
the
company
took
the
speech
for
satire
and
many
laughed
one
young
gentleman
who
wore
a
purple
coat
and
a
splendid
brocaded
vest
laughed
very
loud
a
merchant
nerves
are
delicate
things
he
said
as
he
fingered
his
cravat
i
would
have
said
a
woman
had
i
not
seen
this
very
day
miss
elspeth
horsemanship
and
he
bowed
to
her
very
neatly
now
i
was
never
fond
of
being
quizzed
and
in
that
company
i
could
not
endure
it
we
have
a
saying
sir
i
said
that
the
farmyard
fowl
does
not
fear
the
eagle
the
men
who
look
grave
just
now
are
not
those
who
live
snugly
in
coast
manors
but
the
outland
folk
who
have
to
keep
their
doors
with
their
own
hands
it
was
a
rude
speech
and
my
hard
voice
and
common
clothes
made
it
ruder
the
gentleman
fired
in
a
second
and
with
blazing
eyes
asked
me
if
i
intended
an
insult
i
was
about
to
say
that
he
could
take
what
meaning
he
pleased
when
an
older
man
broke
in
with
tush
charles
let
the
fellow
alone
you
can
not
quarrel
with
a
shopman
i
thank
you
george
for
a
timely
reminder
said
my
gentleman
and
he
turned
away
his
head
with
a
motion
of
sovereign
contempt
come
come
sirs
colonel
beverley
cried
remember
the
sacred
law
of
hospitality
you
are
all
my
guests
and
you
have
a
lady
here
whose
bright
eyes
should
be
a
balm
for
controversies
the
governor
had
sat
with
his
lips
closed
and
his
eyes
roving
the
table
he
dearly
loved
a
quarrel
and
was
minded
to
use
me
to
bait
those
whom
he
liked
little
what
is
all
this
talk
about
gentility
he
said
a
man
is
as
good
as
his
brains
and
his
right
arm
and
no
better
i
am
of
the
creed
of
the
levellers
who
would
have
a
man
stand
stark
before
his
maker
he
could
not
have
spoken
words
better
calculated
to
set
the
company
against
me
my
host
looked
glum
and
disapproving
and
all
the
silken
gentlemen
murmured
the
virginian
cavalier
had
as
pretty
a
notion
of
the
worth
of
descent
as
any
highland
indeed
to
be
honest
i
would
have
controverted
the
governor
myself
for
i
have
ever
held
that
good
blood
is
a
mighty
advantage
to
its
possessor
suddenly
the
grave
man
who
sat
by
miss
elspeth
side
spoke
up
by
this
time
i
had
remembered
that
he
was
doctor
james
blair
the
lately
come
commissary
of
the
diocese
of
london
who
represented
all
that
virginia
had
in
the
way
of
a
bishop
he
had
a
shrewd
kind
face
like
a
scots
dominie
and
a
mouth
that
shut
as
tight
as
the
governor
your
tongue
proclaims
you
my
countryman
sir
he
said
did
i
hear
right
that
your
name
was
garvald
of
auchencairn
he
asked
when
i
had
assented
of
auchencairn
or
what
is
left
of
it
i
said
then
gentlemen
he
said
addressing
the
company
i
can
settle
the
dispute
on
the
facts
without
questioning
his
excellency
dogma
garvald
is
of
as
good
blood
as
any
in
scotland
and
that
said
he
firmly
means
that
in
the
matter
of
birth
he
can
hold
up
his
head
in
any
company
in
any
christian
land
i
do
not
think
this
speech
made
any
man
there
look
on
me
with
greater
favour
but
it
enormously
increased
my
own
comfort
i
have
never
felt
such
a
glow
of
gratitude
as
then
filled
my
heart
to
the
staid
cleric
that
he
was
of
near
kin
to
miss
elspeth
made
it
tenfold
sweeter
i
forgot
my
old
clothes
and
my
uncouth
looks
i
forgot
too
my
irritation
with
the
brocaded
gentleman
if
her
kin
thought
me
worthy
i
cared
not
a
bodle
for
the
rest
of
mankind
presently
we
rose
from
table
and
colonel
beverley
summoned
us
to
the
green
parlour
where
miss
elspeth
was
brewing
a
dish
of
chocolate
then
a
newfangled
luxury
in
the
dominion
i
would
fain
have
made
my
escape
for
if
my
appearance
was
unfit
for
a
it
was
an
outrage
in
a
lady
but
doctor
blair
came
forward
to
me
and
shook
me
warmly
by
the
hand
and
was
full
of
gossip
about
clydesdale
from
which
apparently
he
had
been
absent
these
twenty
years
my
niece
bade
me
bring
you
to
her
he
said
she
poor
child
is
a
happy
exile
but
she
has
now
and
then
an
exile
longings
a
scots
tongue
is
pleasant
in
her
ear
so
i
perforce
had
to
follow
him
into
a
fine
room
with
an
oaken
floor
whereon
lay
rich
smyrna
rugs
and
the
skins
of
wild
beasts
from
the
wood
there
was
a
prodigious
number
of
soft
couches
of
flowered
damask
and
little
tables
inlaid
with
foreign
woods
and
jeweller
work
was
well
enough
for
your
fine
gentleman
in
his
buckled
shoes
and
silk
stockings
to
enter
such
a
place
but
for
myself
in
my
coarse
boots
i
seemed
like
a
colt
in
a
flower
garden
the
girl
sat
by
a
brazier
of
charcoal
with
the
negro
at
hand
doing
her
commands
she
was
so
busy
at
the
chocolate
making
that
when
her
uncle
said
elspeth
i
have
brought
you
garvald
she
had
no
hand
to
give
me
she
looked
up
and
smiled
and
went
on
with
the
business
while
i
stood
awkwardly
by
the
scorn
of
the
assured
gentlemen
around
me
by
and
by
she
spoke
you
and
i
seem
fated
to
meet
in
odd
places
first
it
was
at
carnwath
in
the
rain
and
then
at
the
cauldstaneslap
in
a
motley
company
then
i
think
it
was
in
the
tolbooth
garvald
when
you
were
very
gruff
to
your
deliverer
and
now
we
are
both
exiles
and
once
more
you
step
in
like
a
bogle
out
of
the
night
will
you
taste
my
chocolate
she
served
me
first
and
i
could
see
how
little
the
favour
was
to
the
liking
of
her
little
retinue
of
courtiers
my
silken
gentleman
whose
name
was
grey
broke
in
on
us
abruptly
what
is
this
story
sir
of
indian
dangers
you
are
new
to
the
country
or
you
would
know
that
it
is
the
old
cry
of
the
landless
and
the
lawless
every
republican
makes
it
a
stick
to
beat
his
majesty
are
you
a
republican
mr
garvald
she
asked
now
that
i
remember
i
have
seen
you
in
whiggamore
company
why
no
i
said
i
do
not
meddle
with
politics
i
am
a
merchant
and
am
well
content
with
any
government
that
will
protect
my
trade
and
my
person
a
sudden
perversity
had
taken
me
to
show
myself
at
my
most
prosaic
and
unromantic
i
think
it
was
the
contrast
with
the
glamour
of
those
fine
gentlemen
i
had
neither
claim
nor
desire
to
be
of
their
company
and
to
her
i
could
make
no
pretence
he
laughed
scornfully
yours
is
a
noble
cause
he
said
but
you
may
sleep
peacefully
in
your
bed
sir
be
assured
that
there
are
a
thousand
gentlemen
of
virginia
whose
swords
will
leap
from
their
scabbards
at
a
breath
of
peril
on
behalf
of
their
women
and
their
homes
and
these
he
added
taking
snuff
from
a
gold
box
are
perhaps
as
potent
spurs
to
action
as
the
whims
of
a
busybody
or
the
gains
of
a
trader
i
was
determined
not
to
be
provoked
so
i
answered
nothing
but
miss
elspeth
opened
her
eyes
and
smiled
sweetly
upon
the
speaker
la
grey
i
protest
you
are
too
severe
busybody
well
it
may
be
i
have
found
garvald
very
busy
in
other
folks
affairs
but
i
do
assure
you
he
is
no
i
have
seen
him
in
desperate
conflict
with
savage
men
and
even
with
his
majesty
redcoats
if
trouble
ever
comes
to
virginia
you
will
find
him
i
doubt
not
a
very
bold
it
was
the
light
laughing
tone
i
remembered
well
but
now
it
did
not
vex
me
nothing
that
she
could
say
or
do
could
break
the
spell
that
had
fallen
on
my
heart
i
pray
it
may
be
so
said
grey
as
he
turned
aside
by
this
time
the
governor
had
come
forward
and
i
saw
that
my
presence
was
no
longer
desired
i
wanted
to
get
back
to
shalah
and
solitude
the
cold
bed
on
the
shore
would
be
warmed
for
me
by
happy
dreams
so
i
found
my
host
and
thanked
him
for
my
entertainment
he
gave
me
hastily
as
if
he
were
glad
to
be
rid
of
me
at
the
hall
door
some
one
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
and
i
turned
to
find
my
silken
cavalier
it
seems
you
are
a
gentleman
sir
he
said
so
i
desire
a
word
with
you
your
manners
at
table
deserved
a
whipping
but
i
will
condescend
to
forget
them
but
a
second
offence
shall
be
duly
punished
he
spoke
in
a
high
lisping
voice
which
was
the
latest
london
importation
i
looked
him
square
in
the
eyes
he
was
maybe
an
inch
taller
than
me
a
handsome
fellow
with
a
flushed
petulant
face
and
an
overweening
pride
in
his
arched
brows
by
all
means
let
us
understand
each
other
i
said
i
have
no
wish
to
quarrel
with
you
go
your
way
and
i
will
go
mine
and
there
need
be
no
trouble
that
is
precisely
the
point
said
he
i
do
not
choose
that
your
way
should
take
you
again
to
the
side
of
miss
elspeth
blair
if
it
does
we
shall
quarrel
it
was
the
height
of
flattery
at
last
i
had
found
a
fine
gentleman
who
did
me
the
honour
to
regard
me
with
jealous
eyes
i
laughed
loudly
with
delight
he
turned
and
strolled
back
to
the
company
still
laughing
i
passed
from
the
house
lit
my
lantern
and
plunged
into
the
sombre
woods
chapter
xi
gravity
out
of
bed
a
week
later
i
had
a
visit
from
old
mercer
he
came
to
my
house
in
the
evening
just
after
the
closing
of
the
store
first
of
all
he
paid
out
to
me
the
gold
i
had
lost
from
my
ship
at
accomac
with
all
the
gravity
in
the
world
as
if
it
had
been
an
ordinary
merchant
bargain
then
he
produced
some
papers
and
putting
on
big
horn
spectacles
proceeded
to
instruct
me
in
them
they
were
lists
fuller
than
those
i
had
already
got
of
men
up
and
down
the
country
whom
lawrence
trusted
some
i
had
met
many
i
knew
of
but
two
or
three
gave
me
a
start
there
was
a
planter
in
henricus
who
had
treated
me
like
dirt
and
some
names
from
essex
county
that
i
did
not
expect
especially
there
were
several
in
james
town
itself
one
a
lawyer
body
i
had
thought
the
obedient
serf
of
the
london
merchants
one
the
schoolmaster
and
another
a
drunken
skipper
of
a
river
boat
but
what
struck
me
most
was
the
name
of
colonel
beverley
are
you
sure
of
all
these
i
asked
sure
as
death
he
said
i
not
saying
that
they
all
friends
of
yours
garvald
ye
trampled
on
a
good
wheen
toes
since
you
came
to
these
parts
but
they
all
men
to
ride
the
ford
with
if
that
should
come
which
we
ken
of
some
of
the
men
on
the
list
were
poor
settlers
and
it
was
our
business
to
equip
them
with
horse
and
gun
that
was
to
be
my
special
duty
that
and
the
establishing
of
means
by
which
they
could
be
summoned
quickly
with
the
first
mercer
could
help
me
for
he
had
his
hand
on
all
the
lines
of
the
smuggling
business
and
there
were
a
dozen
ports
on
the
coast
where
he
could
land
arms
horses
were
an
easy
matter
requiring
only
the
doling
out
of
money
but
the
summoning
business
was
to
be
my
particular
care
i
could
go
about
the
country
in
my
ordinary
way
of
trade
without
exciting
suspicion
and
my
house
was
to
be
the
rendezvous
of
every
man
on
the
list
who
wanted
news
or
guidance
can
ye
trust
your
men
mercer
asked
and
i
replied
that
faulkner
was
as
staunch
as
cold
steel
and
that
he
had
picked
the
others
well
let
see
your
accommodation
and
the
old
fellow
hopped
to
his
feet
and
was
out
of
doors
before
i
could
get
the
lantern
mercer
on
a
matter
of
this
sort
was
a
different
being
from
the
decayed
landlord
of
the
tavern
his
spectacled
eyes
peered
everywhere
and
his
shrewd
sense
judged
instantly
of
a
thing
value
he
approved
of
the
as
a
store
for
arms
for
he
could
reach
it
from
the
river
by
a
road
through
the
woods
it
was
easy
so
to
arrange
the
contents
that
a
passing
visitor
could
guess
nothing
and
no
one
ever
penetrated
to
its
recesses
but
faulkner
and
myself
i
summoned
faulkner
to
the
conference
and
told
him
his
duties
which
he
undertook
with
sober
interest
he
was
a
dry
stick
from
fife
who
spoke
seldom
and
wrought
mightily
faulkner
attended
to
mercer
consignments
and
i
took
once
more
to
the
road
i
had
to
arrange
that
arms
from
the
coast
or
the
could
be
sent
inland
and
for
this
purpose
i
had
a
regiment
of
pack
horses
that
delivered
my
own
stores
as
well
i
had
to
visit
all
the
men
on
the
list
whom
i
did
not
know
and
a
weary
job
it
was
i
repeated
again
my
toil
of
the
first
year
and
in
the
hot
virginian
summer
rode
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
my
own
business
prospered
hugely
and
i
bought
on
credit
such
a
stock
of
tobacco
as
made
me
write
my
uncle
for
a
fourth
ship
at
the
harvest
sailing
it
seemed
a
strange
thing
i
remember
to
be
bargaining
for
stuff
which
might
never
be
delivered
for
by
the
autumn
the
dominion
might
be
at
death
grips
in
those
weeks
i
discovered
what
kind
of
force
lawrence
leaned
on
he
who
only
knew
james
town
and
the
rich
planters
knew
little
of
the
true
virginia
there
were
old
men
who
had
long
memories
of
indian
fights
and
men
in
their
prime
who
had
risen
with
bacon
and
young
men
who
had
their
eyes
turned
to
the
unknown
west
there
were
from
scotland
and
north
ireland
and
a
stout
band
of
french
protestants
most
of
them
gently
born
who
had
sought
freedom
for
their
faith
beyond
the
sway
of
king
louis
you
can
not
picture
a
hardier
or
more
spirited
race
than
the
fellows
i
thus
recruited
the
forest
settler
who
swung
an
axe
all
day
for
his
livelihood
could
have
felled
the
ordinary
fine
gentleman
with
one
blow
of
his
fist
and
they
could
shoot
too
with
their
rusty
matchlocks
or
clumsy
snaphances
in
some
few
the
motive
was
fear
for
they
had
seen
or
heard
of
the
tender
mercies
of
the
savages
but
in
most
i
think
it
was
a
love
of
bold
adventure
and
especially
the
craving
to
push
the
white
man
province
beyond
the
narrow
borders
of
the
tidewater
if
you
say
that
this
was
something
more
than
defence
i
claim
that
the
only
way
to
protect
a
country
is
to
make
sure
of
its
environs
what
hope
is
there
of
peace
if
your
frontier
is
the
rim
of
an
unknown
forest
my
hardest
task
was
to
establish
some
method
of
sending
news
to
the
outland
dwellers
for
this
purpose
i
had
to
consort
with
queer
folk
shalah
who
had
become
my
second
shadow
found
here
and
there
little
indian
camps
from
which
he
chose
young
men
as
messengers
in
one
place
i
would
get
a
settler
with
a
canoe
in
another
a
woodman
with
a
fast
horse
and
in
a
third
some
lad
who
prided
himself
on
his
legs
the
rare
country
taverns
were
a
help
for
most
of
their
owners
were
in
the
secret
the
tidewater
is
a
flat
forest
region
so
we
could
not
light
beacons
as
in
a
hilly
land
but
by
the
aid
of
shalah
woodcraft
i
concocted
a
set
of
marks
on
trees
and
dwellings
which
would
speak
a
language
to
any
initiate
traveller
the
indians
too
had
their
own
silent
tongue
by
which
they
could
send
messages
over
many
leagues
in
a
short
space
i
never
learned
the
trick
of
it
though
i
tried
hard
with
shalah
as
interpreter
for
that
you
must
have
been
suckled
in
a
wigwam
when
i
got
back
to
james
town
faulkner
would
report
on
his
visitors
and
he
seems
to
have
had
many
rough
fellows
would
ride
up
at
the
darkening
bringing
a
line
from
mercer
or
more
often
an
agreed
password
and
he
had
to
satisfy
their
wants
and
remember
their
news
so
far
i
had
had
no
word
from
lawrence
though
mercer
reported
that
ringan
was
still
sending
arms
that
of
mine
would
have
made
a
brave
explosion
if
some
one
had
kindled
it
and
indeed
the
thing
more
than
once
was
near
happening
through
a
negro
foolishness
i
spent
all
my
evenings
when
at
home
in
making
a
map
of
the
country
i
had
got
a
rough
chart
from
the
and
filled
up
such
parts
as
i
knew
and
over
all
i
spread
a
network
of
lines
which
meant
my
ways
of
sending
news
for
instance
to
get
to
a
man
in
essex
county
the
word
would
be
passed
by
middle
plantation
to
york
ferry
thence
in
an
indian
canoe
it
would
be
carried
to
aird
store
on
the
mattaponey
from
which
a
woodman
would
take
it
across
the
swamps
to
a
clump
of
hemlocks
there
he
would
make
certain
marks
and
a
lad
from
the
rappahannock
riding
by
daily
to
school
would
carry
the
tidings
to
the
man
i
wanted
and
so
forth
over
the
habitable
dominion
i
calculated
that
there
were
not
more
than
a
dozen
of
lawrence
men
who
within
three
days
could
not
get
the
summons
and
within
five
be
at
the
proper
rendezvous
one
evening
i
was
surprised
by
a
visit
from
colonel
beverley
he
came
openly
on
a
fine
bay
horse
with
two
mounted
negroes
as
attendants
i
had
parted
from
him
dryly
and
had
been
surprised
to
find
that
he
was
one
of
us
but
when
i
had
talked
with
him
a
little
it
appeared
that
he
had
had
a
big
share
in
planning
the
whole
business
we
mentioned
no
names
but
i
gathered
that
he
knew
lawrence
and
was
at
least
aware
of
ringan
he
warned
me
i
remember
to
be
on
my
guard
against
some
of
the
young
bloods
who
might
visit
me
to
make
mischief
it
not
that
they
know
anything
of
our
affairs
he
said
but
that
they
have
got
a
prejudice
against
yourself
garvald
they
are
foolish
lads
very
puffed
up
by
their
pride
of
gentrice
and
i
do
not
like
the
notion
of
their
playing
pranks
in
that
i
asked
him
a
question
which
had
long
puzzled
me
why
the
natural
defence
of
a
country
should
be
kept
so
secret
the
governor
at
any
rate
i
said
would
approve
and
we
are
not
asking
the
burgesses
for
a
single
guinea
yes
but
the
governor
would
play
a
wild
hand
was
the
answer
he
would
never
permit
the
thing
to
go
on
quietly
but
would
want
to
ride
at
the
head
of
the
men
and
the
whole
fat
would
be
in
the
fire
you
must
know
garvald
that
politics
run
high
in
our
virginia
there
are
scores
of
men
who
would
see
in
our
enterprise
a
second
attempt
like
bacon
and
though
they
might
approve
of
our
aims
would
never
hear
of
one
of
bacon
folk
serving
with
us
i
was
never
a
bacon
man
for
i
was
with
berkeley
in
accomac
and
at
the
taking
of
james
town
but
i
know
the
quality
of
the
rough
fellows
that
bacon
led
and
i
want
them
all
for
this
adventure
besides
who
can
deny
that
there
is
more
in
our
plans
than
a
defence
against
indians
there
are
many
who
feel
with
me
that
virginia
can
never
grow
to
the
fullness
of
a
nation
so
long
as
she
is
cooped
up
in
the
tidewater
arrive
by
every
ship
from
england
and
press
on
into
the
wilderness
but
there
can
be
no
conquest
of
the
wilderness
till
we
have
broken
the
indian
menace
and
pushed
our
frontier
up
to
the
hills
ay
and
beyond
them
but
tell
that
to
the
ordinary
planter
and
he
will
assign
you
to
the
devil
he
fears
these
who
are
simple
fellows
that
do
not
respect
his
grandeur
he
fears
that
some
day
they
may
control
the
assembly
by
their
votes
he
wants
the
tidewater
to
be
his
castle
with
porters
and
guards
to
hound
away
strangers
man
alive
if
you
had
tried
to
put
reason
into
some
of
their
heads
you
would
despair
of
human
nature
let
them
get
a
hint
of
our
preparations
and
there
will
be
petitions
to
council
and
a
howling
about
treason
and
in
a
week
you
will
be
in
gaol
garvald
so
we
must
move
cannily
as
you
scots
say
that
conversation
made
me
wary
and
i
got
faulkner
to
keep
a
special
guard
on
the
place
when
i
was
absent
at
the
worst
he
could
summon
mercer
who
would
bring
a
rough
crew
from
the
to
his
aid
then
once
more
i
disappeared
into
the
woods
in
these
days
a
new
shalah
revealed
himself
i
think
he
had
been
watching
me
closely
for
the
past
months
and
slowly
i
had
won
his
approval
he
showed
it
by
beginning
to
talk
as
he
loped
by
my
side
in
our
forest
wanderings
the
man
was
like
no
indian
i
have
ever
seen
he
was
a
senecan
and
so
should
have
been
on
the
side
of
the
long
house
but
it
was
plain
that
he
was
an
outcast
from
his
tribe
and
indeed
from
the
whole
indian
brotherhood
i
could
not
fathom
him
for
he
seemed
among
savages
to
be
held
in
deep
respect
and
yet
here
he
was
the
ally
of
the
white
man
against
his
race
his
lean
supple
figure
his
passionless
face
and
his
high
masterful
air
had
a
singular
nobility
in
them
to
me
he
was
never
the
servant
scarcely
even
the
companion
for
he
seemed
like
a
being
from
another
world
who
had
a
knowledge
of
things
hid
from
human
ken
in
woodcraft
he
was
a
master
beyond
all
thought
of
rivalry
often
when
time
did
not
press
he
would
lead
me
clumsy
as
i
was
so
that
i
could
almost
touch
the
muzzle
of
a
crouching
deer
or
lay
a
hand
on
a
yellow
panther
before
it
slipped
like
a
live
streak
of
light
into
the
gloom
he
was
an
eery
fellow
too
once
i
found
him
on
a
high
river
bank
at
sunset
watching
the
red
glow
behind
the
blue
shadowy
forest
there
is
blood
in
the
west
he
said
pointing
like
a
prophet
with
his
long
arm
there
is
blood
in
the
hills
which
is
flowing
to
the
waters
at
the
moon
of
stags
it
will
flow
and
by
the
moon
of
wildfowl
it
will
have
stained
the
sea
he
had
always
the
hills
at
the
back
of
his
head
once
when
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
them
from
a
place
far
up
the
james
river
he
stood
like
a
statue
gazing
at
the
thin
line
which
hung
like
a
cloud
in
the
west
i
am
upland
bred
and
to
me
too
the
sight
was
a
comfort
as
i
stood
beside
him
the
in
the
hills
is
calling
he
said
abruptly
i
wait
a
little
but
not
long
you
too
will
follow
brother
to
where
the
hawks
wheel
and
the
streams
fall
in
vapour
there
we
shall
find
death
or
love
i
know
not
which
but
it
will
be
a
great
finding
the
gods
have
written
it
on
my
heart
then
he
turned
and
strode
away
and
i
did
not
dare
to
question
him
there
was
that
about
him
which
stirred
my
prosaic
soul
into
a
wild
poetry
till
for
the
moment
i
saw
with
his
eyes
and
heard
strange
voices
in
the
trees
apart
from
these
uncanny
moods
he
was
the
most
faithful
helper
in
my
task
without
him
i
must
have
been
a
mere
child
i
could
not
read
the
lore
of
the
forest
i
could
not
have
found
my
way
as
he
found
it
through
pathless
places
from
him
too
i
learned
that
we
were
not
to
make
our
preparations
unwatched
once
as
we
were
coming
from
the
rappahannock
to
the
york
he
darted
suddenly
into
the
undergrowth
below
the
chestnuts
my
eye
could
see
no
clue
on
the
path
and
suspecting
nothing
i
waited
on
him
to
return
presently
he
came
and
beckoned
me
to
follow
thirty
yards
into
the
coppice
we
found
a
man
lying
dead
with
a
sharp
stake
holding
him
to
the
ground
and
a
raw
red
mass
where
had
been
once
his
head
that
was
your
messenger
brother
he
whispered
the
one
who
was
to
carry
word
from
the
mattaponey
to
the
north
see
he
has
been
dead
for
two
suns
he
was
one
of
the
tame
algonquins
who
dwelt
by
aird
store
who
did
it
i
asked
with
a
very
sick
stomach
a
cherokee
some
cunning
one
and
he
left
a
sign
to
guide
us
he
showed
me
a
he
had
picked
up
from
the
path
with
the
sharp
end
cut
short
and
a
thorn
stuck
in
the
middle
the
thing
disquieted
me
horribly
for
we
had
heard
no
word
yet
of
any
movement
from
the
west
and
yet
it
seemed
that
our
enemy
scouts
had
come
far
down
into
the
tidewater
and
knew
enough
to
single
out
for
death
a
man
we
had
enrolled
for
service
shalah
slipped
off
without
a
word
and
i
was
left
to
continue
my
journey
alone
i
will
not
pretend
that
i
liked
the
business
i
saw
an
indian
in
every
patch
of
shadow
and
looked
pretty
often
to
my
pistols
before
i
reached
the
security
of
aird
house
four
days
later
shalah
appeared
at
james
town
they
were
three
he
said
simply
they
came
from
the
hills
a
moon
ago
and
have
been
making
bad
trouble
on
the
rappahannock
i
found
them
at
the
place
above
the
beaver
traps
of
the
ooniche
they
return
no
more
to
their
people
after
that
we
sent
out
warnings
and
kept
a
close
eye
on
the
different
lodges
of
the
algonquins
but
nothing
happened
till
weeks
later
when
the
tragedy
on
the
rapidan
fell
on
us
like
a
thunderclap
all
this
time
i
had
been
too
busy
to
go
near
the
town
or
the
and
holiday
meetings
where
i
might
have
seen
elspeth
but
i
do
not
think
she
was
ever
many
minutes
out
of
my
mind
indeed
i
was
almost
afraid
of
a
meeting
lest
it
should
shatter
the
bright
picture
which
comforted
my
solitude
but
one
evening
in
june
as
i
jogged
home
from
middle
plantation
through
the
groves
of
walnuts
i
came
suddenly
at
the
turn
of
the
road
on
a
party
doctor
james
blair
mounted
on
a
stout
flanders
cob
held
the
middle
of
the
path
and
at
his
side
rode
the
girl
while
two
servants
followed
with
travelling
valises
i
was
upon
them
before
i
could
rein
up
and
the
doctor
cried
a
hearty
so
i
took
my
place
by
elspeth
and
with
my
heart
beating
wildly
accompanied
them
through
the
leafy
avenues
and
by
the
green
in
the
clearings
till
we
came
out
on
the
prospect
of
the
river
the
doctor
had
a
kindness
for
me
and
was
eager
to
talk
of
his
doings
he
was
almost
as
great
a
as
myself
and
with
elspeth
for
company
had
visited
near
every
settlement
in
the
dominion
education
and
christian
privileges
were
his
care
and
he
deplored
the
backward
state
of
the
land
i
remember
that
even
then
he
was
full
of
his
scheme
for
a
virginian
college
to
be
established
at
middle
plantation
and
he
wrote
weekly
letters
to
his
english
friends
soliciting
countenance
and
funds
of
the
happy
issue
of
these
hopes
and
the
great
college
which
now
stands
at
williamsburg
there
is
no
need
to
remind
this
generation
but
in
that
hour
i
thought
little
of
education
the
doctor
boomed
away
in
his
deep
voice
and
i
gave
him
heedless
answers
my
eyes
were
ever
wandering
to
the
slim
figure
at
my
side
she
wore
a
broad
hat
of
straw
i
remember
and
her
skirt
and
kirtle
were
of
green
the
colour
i
think
she
was
wearied
with
the
sun
for
she
spoke
little
but
her
eyes
when
they
met
mine
were
kind
that
day
i
was
not
ashamed
of
my
plain
clothes
or
my
homely
face
for
they
suited
well
with
the
road
my
great
boots
of
untanned
buckskin
were
red
with
dust
i
was
bronzed
like
an
indian
and
the
sun
had
taken
the
colour
out
of
my
old
blue
coat
but
i
smacked
of
travel
and
enterprise
which
to
an
honest
heart
are
dearer
than
brocade
also
i
had
a
notion
that
my
very
homeliness
revived
in
her
the
memories
of
our
common
motherland
i
had
nothing
to
say
having
acquired
the
woodland
habit
of
silence
and
perhaps
it
was
well
my
clumsy
tongue
would
have
only
broken
the
spell
which
the
sunlit
forests
had
woven
around
us
as
we
reached
my
house
a
cavalier
rode
up
with
a
bow
and
a
splendid
sweep
of
his
hat
was
my
acquaintance
grey
come
to
greet
the
travellers
elspeth
gave
me
her
hand
at
parting
and
i
had
from
the
cavalier
the
finest
glance
of
hate
and
jealousy
which
ever
comforted
the
heart
of
a
backward
lover
chapter
xii
a
word
at
the
the
next
sunday
i
was
fool
enough
to
go
to
church
for
doctor
blair
was
announced
to
preach
the
sermon
now
i
knew
very
well
what
treatment
i
should
get
and
that
it
takes
a
stout
fellow
to
front
a
conspiracy
of
scorn
but
i
had
got
new
courage
from
my
travels
so
i
put
on
my
best
suit
of
cloth
my
stockings
of
cherry
silk
the
gold
buckles
which
had
been
my
father
my
waistcoat
ruffles
and
a
new
hat
which
had
cost
forty
shillings
in
london
town
i
wore
my
own
hair
for
i
never
saw
the
sense
of
a
wig
save
for
a
bald
man
but
i
had
it
deftly
tied
i
would
have
cut
a
great
figure
had
there
not
been
my
bronzed
and
rugged
face
to
give
the
lie
to
my
finery
it
was
a
day
of
blistering
heat
the
river
lay
still
as
a
lagoon
and
the
dusty
red
roads
of
the
town
blazed
like
a
furnace
before
i
had
got
to
the
church
door
i
was
in
a
great
sweat
and
stopped
in
the
porch
to
fan
myself
inside
was
cool
enough
with
a
pleasant
smell
from
the
cedar
pews
but
there
was
such
a
press
of
a
congregation
that
many
were
left
standing
i
had
a
good
place
just
below
the
choir
where
i
saw
the
governor
carved
chair
with
the
governor
self
before
it
on
his
making
pretence
to
pray
round
the
choir
rail
and
below
the
pulpit
clustered
many
young
exquisites
for
this
was
a
sovereign
place
from
which
to
show
off
their
finery
i
could
not
get
a
sight
of
elspeth
doctor
blair
preached
us
a
fine
sermon
from
the
text
people
shall
dwell
in
a
pleasant
habitation
and
in
sure
dwellings
and
in
quiet
but
his
hearers
were
much
disturbed
by
the
continual
chatter
of
the
fools
about
the
choir
rail
before
he
had
got
to
the
prayer
of
chrysostom
the
exquisites
were
whispering
like
pigeons
in
a
dovecot
exchanging
and
ogling
the
women
so
intolerable
it
grew
that
the
doctor
paused
in
his
discourse
and
sternly
rebuked
them
speaking
of
the
laughter
of
fools
which
is
as
the
crackling
of
thorns
under
a
pot
this
silenced
them
for
a
little
but
the
noise
broke
out
during
the
last
prayer
and
with
the
final
word
of
the
benediction
my
gentlemen
thrust
their
way
through
the
congregation
that
they
might
be
the
first
at
the
church
door
i
have
never
seen
so
unseemly
a
sight
and
for
a
moment
i
thought
that
governor
nicholson
would
call
the
halberdiers
and
set
them
in
the
pillory
he
refrained
though
his
face
was
dark
with
wrath
and
i
judged
that
there
would
be
some
hard
words
said
before
the
matter
was
finished
i
must
tell
you
that
during
the
last
week
i
had
been
coming
more
into
favour
with
the
prosperous
families
of
the
colony
some
one
may
have
spoken
well
of
me
perhaps
the
doctor
or
they
may
have
seen
the
justice
of
my
way
of
trading
anyhow
i
had
a
civil
greeting
from
several
of
the
planters
and
a
bow
from
their
dames
but
no
sooner
was
i
in
the
porch
than
i
saw
that
trouble
was
afoot
with
the
young
bloods
they
were
drawn
up
on
both
sides
the
path
bent
on
quizzing
me
i
sternly
resolved
to
keep
my
temper
but
i
foresaw
that
it
would
not
be
easy
behold
the
shopman
in
his
sunday
best
said
one
i
thought
that
sawney
wore
bare
knees
on
his
dirty
hills
said
another
one
pointed
to
my
buckles
pinchbeck
out
of
the
store
he
says
ho
ho
such
finery
cried
another
see
how
he
struts
like
a
gamecock
there
much
ado
when
beggars
ride
said
a
third
quoting
the
proverb
it
was
all
so
pitifully
childish
that
it
failed
to
provoke
me
i
marched
down
the
path
with
a
smile
on
my
face
which
succeeded
in
angering
them
one
young
fool
a
norton
from
malreward
would
have
hustled
me
but
i
saw
grey
hold
him
back
no
brawling
here
austin
said
my
rival
they
were
not
all
so
discreet
one
of
the
kents
of
gracedieu
tried
to
trip
me
by
thrusting
his
cane
between
my
legs
but
was
ready
for
him
and
pulling
up
quick
and
bracing
my
knees
i
snapped
the
thing
short
so
that
he
was
left
to
dangle
the
ivory
top
then
he
did
a
wild
thing
he
flung
the
remnant
at
my
face
so
that
the
ragged
end
scratched
my
cheek
when
i
turned
wrathfully
i
found
a
circle
of
grinning
faces
it
is
queer
how
a
wound
however
slight
breaks
a
man
temper
and
upsets
his
calm
resolves
i
think
that
then
and
there
i
would
have
been
involved
in
a
mellay
had
not
a
voice
spoke
behind
me
garvald
it
said
will
you
give
me
the
favour
of
your
arm
we
dine
with
his
excellency
i
turned
to
find
elspeth
and
close
behind
her
doctor
blair
and
governor
nicholson
all
my
heat
left
me
and
i
had
not
another
thought
for
my
tormentors
in
that
torrid
noon
she
looked
as
cool
and
fragrant
as
a
flower
her
clothes
were
simple
compared
with
the
planters
dames
but
of
a
far
more
dainty
fashion
she
wore
i
remember
a
gown
of
pale
sprigged
muslin
with
a
blue
kerchief
about
her
shoulders
and
blue
ribbons
in
her
wide
hat
as
her
hand
lay
lightly
on
my
arm
i
did
not
think
of
my
triumph
being
wholly
taken
up
with
the
admiration
of
her
grace
the
walk
was
all
too
short
for
the
governor
lodging
was
but
a
distant
when
we
parted
at
the
door
i
hoped
to
find
some
of
my
mockers
still
lingering
for
in
that
hour
i
think
i
could
have
flung
any
three
of
them
into
the
river
none
were
left
however
and
as
i
walked
homewards
i
reflected
very
seriously
that
the
baiting
of
andrew
garvald
could
not
endure
for
long
pretty
soon
i
must
read
these
young
gentry
a
lesson
little
though
i
wanted
to
embroil
myself
in
quarrels
i
called
them
young
in
scorn
but
few
of
them
i
fancy
were
younger
than
myself
next
day
as
it
happened
i
had
business
with
mercer
at
the
and
as
i
returned
along
the
harbour
front
i
fell
in
with
the
receiver
of
customs
who
was
generally
called
the
captain
of
the
castle
from
his
station
at
point
comfort
he
was
an
elderly
fellow
who
had
once
been
a
puritan
and
still
cherished
a
trace
of
the
puritan
modes
of
speech
i
had
often
had
dealings
with
him
and
had
found
him
honest
though
a
thought
truculent
in
manner
he
had
a
passion
against
all
smugglers
and
buccaneers
and
in
days
to
come
was
to
do
good
service
in
ridding
accomac
of
these
scourges
he
feared
god
and
did
not
greatly
fear
much
else
he
was
sitting
on
the
low
wall
smoking
a
pipe
and
had
by
him
a
very
singular
gentleman
never
have
i
set
eyes
on
a
more
decorous
merchant
he
was
habited
neatly
and
soberly
in
black
with
a
fine
white
cravat
and
starched
he
wore
a
plain
below
a
huge
hat
and
big
blue
spectacles
shaded
his
eyes
his
mouth
was
as
precise
as
a
lawyer
and
altogether
he
was
a
very
whimsical
dry
fellow
to
find
at
a
virginian
port
the
receiver
called
me
to
him
and
asked
after
a
matter
which
we
had
spoken
of
before
then
he
made
me
known
to
his
companion
who
was
a
fairweather
a
merchant
out
of
boston
the
lord
hath
given
thee
a
pleasant
dwelling
friend
said
the
stranger
snuffling
a
little
through
his
nose
from
his
speech
i
knew
that
fairweather
was
of
the
sect
of
the
quakers
a
peaceable
race
that
virginia
had
long
the
land
is
none
so
bad
said
the
receiver
but
the
people
are
a
perverse
generation
their
hearts
are
set
on
vanity
and
puffed
up
with
pride
i
could
wish
fairweather
that
my
lines
had
fallen
among
your
folk
in
the
north
where
i
am
told
true
religion
yet
flourisheth
here
we
have
nothing
but
the
cold
harangues
of
the
commissary
who
seeketh
after
the
knowledge
that
perisheth
rather
than
the
wisdom
which
is
eternal
life
patience
friend
said
the
stranger
thee
is
not
alone
in
thy
crosses
the
lord
hath
many
people
up
boston
way
but
they
are
sore
beset
by
the
tribulations
of
zion
on
land
there
is
war
and
rumour
of
war
and
on
the
sea
the
ships
of
the
godly
are
snatched
by
every
manner
of
ocean
thief
likewise
we
have
dissension
among
ourselves
and
a
constant
strife
with
the
froward
human
heart
still
is
jerusalem
troubled
and
there
is
no
peace
within
her
bulwarks
do
the
pirates
afflict
you
much
in
the
north
asked
the
receiver
with
keen
interest
the
stranger
turned
his
large
spectacles
upon
him
and
then
looked
blandly
at
me
suddenly
i
had
a
notion
that
i
had
seen
that
turn
of
the
neck
and
poise
of
the
head
before
woe
is
me
he
cried
in
a
stricken
voice
the
french
have
two
fair
vessels
of
mine
since
march
and
a
third
is
missing
some
say
it
ran
for
a
virginian
port
and
i
am
here
to
seek
it
heard
thee
ever
friend
of
a
strange
ship
in
the
james
or
the
potomac
there
be
many
strange
ships
said
the
receiver
for
this
dominion
is
the
goal
for
all
the
wandering
merchantmen
of
the
earth
what
was
the
name
of
yours
a
schooner
out
of
bristol
painted
green
with
a
white
figurehead
of
a
winged
heathen
god
and
the
name
the
name
is
a
strange
one
it
is
called
horn
of
but
i
seek
to
prevail
on
the
captain
to
change
it
to
horn
of
no
such
name
is
known
to
me
and
the
receiver
shook
his
head
but
i
will
remember
it
and
send
you
news
i
hope
i
did
not
betray
my
surprise
but
for
all
that
it
was
staggering
of
all
disguises
and
of
all
companies
this
was
the
most
comic
and
the
most
hazardous
i
stared
across
the
river
till
i
had
mastered
my
countenance
and
when
i
looked
again
at
the
two
they
were
soberly
discussing
the
harbour
dues
of
boston
presently
the
receiver
sloop
arrived
to
carry
him
to
point
comfort
he
nodded
to
me
and
took
an
affectionate
farewell
of
the
boston
man
i
heard
some
good
texts
exchanged
between
them
then
when
we
were
alone
the
quaker
turned
to
me
man
andrew
he
said
it
was
a
good
thing
that
i
had
a
bible
upbringing
i
can
manage
the
part
fine
but
i
flounder
among
the
and
i
would
be
the
better
of
a
drink
to
wash
my
mouth
of
the
accursed
pronouns
will
you
be
alone
about
the
darkening
then
i
call
in
to
see
you
for
i
much
to
tell
you
that
evening
about
nine
the
quaker
slipped
into
my
room
how
about
that
he
asked
is
it
well
guarded
faulkner
and
one
of
the
men
sleep
above
it
and
there
are
a
couple
of
fierce
dogs
chained
at
the
door
unless
they
know
the
stranger
he
will
be
apt
to
lose
the
seat
of
his
breeches
the
quaker
nodded
well
pleased
that
is
well
for
i
heard
word
in
the
town
that
you
might
have
a
visitor
or
two
then
he
walked
to
a
stand
of
arms
on
the
wall
and
took
down
a
small
sword
which
he
handled
lovingly
a
fair
weapon
andrew
said
he
my
new
sect
forbids
me
to
wear
a
blade
but
i
think
i
keep
this
handy
beside
me
in
the
chimney
corner
then
he
gave
me
the
news
lawrence
had
been
far
inland
with
the
monacans
and
had
brought
back
disquieting
tales
the
whole
nation
of
the
cherokees
along
the
line
of
the
mountains
was
unquiet
old
family
feuds
had
been
patched
up
and
there
was
a
coming
and
going
of
messengers
from
chickamauga
to
the
potomac
well
we
ready
for
them
i
said
and
i
told
him
the
full
story
of
our
preparations
ay
but
that
is
not
all
i
would
not
give
much
for
what
the
cherokees
and
the
tuscaroras
could
do
there
might
be
some
blood
shed
and
a
good
few
blazing
in
the
back
country
but
no
indian
raid
would
stand
against
our
lads
but
i
have
a
notion
maybe
it
only
a
notion
though
lawrence
is
half
inclined
to
it
himself
that
there
more
in
this
business
than
a
raid
from
the
hills
there
something
stirring
in
the
west
away
in
the
parts
that
no
white
man
has
ever
travelled
from
what
i
learn
there
a
bigger
brain
than
an
indian
behind
it
the
french
i
asked
maybe
but
maybe
not
what
to
hinder
a
blackguard
like
cosh
with
ten
times
cosh
mind
from
getting
into
the
indian
councils
and
turning
the
whole
west
loose
on
the
tidewater
have
you
any
proof
i
asked
much
alarmed
little
at
present
but
one
thing
i
know
there
a
man
among
the
tribes
that
speaks
english
great
god
what
a
villain
i
cried
but
how
do
you
know
just
this
way
the
monacans
put
an
arrow
through
the
neck
of
a
young
brave
and
they
found
this
in
his
belt
he
laid
before
me
a
bit
of
a
printed
bible
leaf
about
half
was
blank
paper
for
it
came
at
the
end
of
the
book
of
revelation
on
the
blank
part
some
signs
had
been
made
in
rude
ink
which
i
could
not
understand
but
this
is
no
proof
i
said
it
only
a
relic
from
some
plundered
settlement
can
you
read
those
marks
i
can
not
nor
could
the
monacans
but
look
at
the
printed
part
i
looked
again
and
saw
that
some
one
had
very
carefully
underlined
certain
words
these
made
a
sentence
and
read
servant
of
the
prophecy
is
at
the
underlining
may
have
been
done
long
ago
i
hazarded
no
the
ink
is
not
a
month
old
he
said
and
i
could
do
nothing
but
gape
well
what
your
plan
i
said
at
last
none
but
i
would
give
my
right
hand
to
know
what
is
behind
the
hills
that
our
weakness
andrew
we
have
to
wait
here
and
since
we
do
not
know
the
full
peril
we
can
not
fully
prepare
there
may
be
mischief
afoot
which
would
rouse
every
sleepy
planter
out
of
bed
and
turn
the
tidewater
into
an
armed
camp
but
we
know
nothing
if
we
had
only
a
scout
what
about
shalah
i
asked
can
you
spare
him
he
replied
and
i
knew
i
could
not
i
see
nothing
for
it
i
said
but
to
wait
till
we
are
ready
and
then
to
make
a
reconnaissance
trusting
to
be
in
time
this
is
the
first
week
of
july
in
another
fortnight
every
man
on
our
list
will
be
armed
and
every
line
of
communication
laid
then
is
our
chance
to
make
a
bid
for
news
he
nodded
and
at
that
moment
came
the
growling
of
dogs
from
the
sheds
instantly
his
face
lost
its
heavy
preoccupation
and
under
his
mask
became
the
mischievous
countenance
of
a
boy
that
your
friends
he
said
now
for
a
merry
meeting
in
the
sultry
weather
i
had
left
open
window
and
door
and
every
sound
came
clear
from
the
outside
i
heard
the
scuffling
of
feet
and
some
confused
talk
and
presently
there
stumbled
into
my
house
half
a
dozen
figures
they
blinked
in
the
lamplight
and
one
begged
to
know
if
garbled
were
at
home
all
had
decked
themselves
for
this
play
in
what
they
fancied
was
the
dress
of
pirates
scarlet
sashes
and
napkins
or
turbans
round
their
heads
big
boots
and
masks
over
their
eyes
i
did
not
recognize
a
face
but
i
was
pretty
clear
that
grey
was
not
of
the
number
and
i
was
glad
for
the
matter
between
him
and
me
was
too
serious
for
this
tomfoolery
all
had
been
drinking
and
one
at
least
was
very
drunk
he
stumbled
across
the
floor
and
all
but
fell
on
ringan
in
his
chair
hullo
old
he
hiccupped
what
the
devil
are
you
friend
thee
is
shaky
on
thy
legs
said
ringan
in
a
mild
voice
it
were
well
for
thee
to
be
in
bed
bed
cried
the
roysterer
no
bed
for
me
this
night
where
is
that
damnable
scots
packman
i
rose
very
quietly
and
lit
another
lamp
then
i
shut
the
window
and
closed
the
shutters
here
i
am
i
said
very
much
at
your
service
gentlemen
one
or
two
of
the
sober
ones
looked
a
little
embarrassed
but
the
leader
who
i
guessed
was
the
youth
from
gracedieu
was
brave
enough
the
gentlemen
of
virginia
he
said
loudly
being
resolved
that
the
man
garvald
is
an
offence
to
the
dominion
have
summoned
the
free
companions
to
give
him
a
lesson
if
he
will
sign
a
bond
to
leave
the
country
within
a
month
we
are
instructed
to
be
merciful
if
not
we
have
here
tar
and
feathers
and
sundry
other
adornments
and
morn
will
behold
a
pretty
sight
choose
you
scots
swine
in
the
excess
of
his
zeal
he
smashed
with
the
handle
of
his
sword
a
clock
i
had
but
lately
got
from
glasgow
ringan
signed
to
me
to
keep
my
temper
he
pretended
to
be
in
a
great
taking
i
am
a
man
of
peace
he
cried
but
i
can
not
endure
to
see
my
friend
outraged
prithee
good
folk
go
away
see
i
will
give
thee
a
guinea
each
to
leave
us
alone
this
had
the
desired
effect
of
angering
them
curse
your
money
one
cried
you
damned
traders
think
that
you
can
buy
a
gentleman
take
that
for
your
insult
and
he
aimed
a
blow
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
which
ringan
easily
parried
i
had
thought
thee
a
pirate
said
the
mild
quaker
but
thee
tells
me
thee
is
a
gentleman
hold
your
peace
cried
the
leader
and
let
get
to
business
but
if
ye
be
gentlefolk
pleaded
ringan
ye
will
grant
a
fair
field
i
am
no
fighter
but
i
will
stand
by
my
friend
i
who
had
said
nothing
now
broke
in
it
is
a
warm
evening
for
but
if
it
is
your
humour
so
be
it
this
seemed
to
them
hugely
comic
la
cried
one
sawney
with
a
sword
and
he
plucked
forth
his
own
blade
and
bent
it
on
the
floor
ringan
smiled
gently
thee
must
grant
me
the
first
favour
he
said
for
i
am
the
challenger
if
that
be
the
right
word
of
the
carnally
minded
and
standing
up
he
picked
up
the
blade
from
beside
him
and
bowed
to
the
leader
from
gracedieu
nothing
loath
he
engaged
and
the
others
stood
back
expecting
a
high
fiasco
they
saw
it
ringan
sword
played
like
lightning
round
the
wretched
youth
it
twitched
the
blade
from
his
grasp
and
forced
him
back
with
a
very
white
face
to
the
door
in
less
than
a
minute
it
seemed
he
was
there
and
as
he
yielded
so
did
the
door
and
he
disappeared
into
the
night
he
did
not
return
so
i
knew
that
ringan
must
have
spoke
a
word
to
faulkner
now
for
the
next
pirate
cried
ringan
and
the
next
with
a
very
wry
face
stood
up
one
of
the
others
would
have
joined
in
but
crying
for
shame
a
fair
field
i
beat
down
his
sword
the
next
took
about
the
same
time
to
reach
the
door
and
disappeared
into
the
darkness
and
the
third
about
half
as
long
of
the
remaining
three
one
sulkily
declined
to
draw
and
the
other
two
were
over
drunk
for
anything
they
sat
on
the
floor
and
sang
a
loose
song
it
seems
friends
said
the
quaker
that
ye
be
more
ready
with
words
than
with
deeds
i
pray
thee
this
to
the
sober
one
take
off
these
garments
of
sin
we
be
peaceful
traders
and
can
not
abide
the
thought
of
pirates
he
took
them
off
sash
breeches
jerkin
turban
and
all
and
stood
up
in
his
shirt
the
other
two
i
stripped
myself
and
so
drunk
were
they
that
they
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
and
themselves
tore
at
the
buttons
then
with
ringan
sword
behind
them
the
three
marched
out
of
doors
there
we
found
their
companions
stripped
and
sullen
with
faulkner
and
the
men
to
guard
them
we
made
up
neat
parcels
of
their
clothes
and
i
extorted
their
names
all
except
one
who
was
too
far
gone
in
drink
gentlemen
i
said
i
will
send
back
your
belongings
together
with
the
tar
and
feathers
which
you
may
find
useful
some
other
day
the
night
is
mild
and
a
gentle
trot
will
keep
you
from
taking
chills
i
should
recommend
hurry
for
in
five
minutes
the
dogs
will
be
loosed
a
pleasant
journey
to
you
they
moved
off
and
then
halted
and
apparently
were
for
returning
but
they
thought
better
of
it
and
presently
they
were
all
six
of
them
racing
and
stumbling
down
the
hill
in
their
shifts
the
quaker
stretched
his
legs
and
lit
a
pipe
was
it
not
a
scurvy
trick
of
fate
he
observed
to
the
ceiling
that
these
poor
lads
should
come
here
for
a
night
fooling
and
find
the
best
sword
in
the
five
seas
chapter
xiii
i
stumble
into
a
great
folly
i
never
breathed
a
word
about
the
night
doings
nor
for
divers
reasons
did
ringan
but
the
story
got
about
and
the
young
fools
were
the
of
the
place
but
there
was
a
good
deal
of
wrath
too
that
a
trader
should
have
presumed
so
far
and
i
felt
that
things
were
gathering
to
a
crisis
with
me
unless
i
was
to
suffer
endlessly
these
petty
vexations
i
must
find
a
bold
stroke
to
end
them
it
annoyed
me
that
when
so
many
grave
issues
were
in
the
balance
i
should
have
these
troubles
as
if
a
man
should
be
devoured
by
midges
when
waiting
on
a
desperate
combat
the
crisis
came
sooner
than
i
looked
for
there
was
to
be
a
great
at
middle
plantation
the
next
monday
which
i
had
half
a
mind
to
attend
for
though
i
cared
nothing
for
the
sport
it
would
give
me
a
chance
of
seeing
some
of
our
fellows
from
the
york
river
one
morning
i
met
elspeth
in
the
street
of
james
town
and
she
cried
laughingly
that
she
looked
to
see
me
at
the
races
after
that
i
had
no
choice
but
go
so
on
the
monday
morning
i
dressed
myself
with
care
mounted
my
best
horse
and
rode
to
the
gathering
was
a
pretty
sight
to
see
the
spacious
green
meadow
now
a
little
yellowing
with
the
summer
heat
set
in
the
girdle
of
dark
and
leafy
forest
i
counted
over
forty
chariots
which
had
brought
the
rank
of
the
countryside
each
with
its
liveried
servant
and
its
complement
of
outriders
the
fringe
of
the
course
blazed
with
ladies
finery
and
a
tent
had
been
set
up
with
a
wide
awning
from
which
the
fashionables
could
watch
the
sport
on
the
edge
of
the
woods
a
multitude
of
horses
were
picketed
and
there
were
booths
that
sold
food
and
drink
and
fiddlers
and
an
immense
concourse
of
every
condition
of
folk
black
slaves
and
indians
squatters
from
the
woods
farmers
from
all
the
valleys
and
the
scum
and
ruck
of
the
plantations
i
found
some
of
my
friends
and
settled
my
business
with
them
but
my
eyes
were
always
straying
to
the
green
awning
where
i
knew
that
elspeth
sat
i
am
no
judge
of
racing
but
i
love
the
aspect
of
sleek
slim
horses
and
i
could
applaud
a
skill
in
which
i
had
no
share
i
can
keep
my
seat
on
most
beasts
but
my
horsemanship
is
a
clumsy
affair
very
different
from
the
effortless
grace
of
your
true
cavalier
grey
prowess
especially
filled
me
with
awe
he
would
leap
an
ugly
fence
without
moving
an
inch
in
his
saddle
and
both
in
skill
and
the
quality
of
his
mounts
he
was
an
easy
victor
the
sight
of
such
accomplishments
depressed
my
pride
and
i
do
not
think
i
would
have
ventured
near
the
tent
had
it
not
been
for
the
governor
he
saw
me
on
the
fringe
of
the
crowd
and
called
me
to
him
what
bashfulness
has
taken
you
sir
he
cried
that
is
not
like
your
usual
there
are
twenty
pretty
dames
here
who
pine
for
a
word
from
you
i
saw
his
purpose
well
enough
he
loved
to
make
mischief
and
knew
that
the
sight
of
me
among
the
virginian
gentry
would
infuriate
my
unfriends
but
i
took
him
at
his
word
and
elbowed
my
way
into
the
enclosure
then
i
wished
to
heaven
i
had
stayed
at
home
i
got
insolent
glances
from
the
youths
and
the
cold
shoulder
from
the
ladies
elspeth
smiled
when
she
saw
me
but
turned
the
next
second
to
gossip
with
her
little
court
she
was
a
devout
lover
of
horses
and
had
eyes
for
nothing
but
the
racing
her
cheeks
were
flushed
and
it
was
pretty
to
watch
her
excitement
how
she
hung
breathless
on
the
movements
of
the
field
and
clapped
her
hands
at
a
brave
finish
pretty
indeed
but
exasperating
to
one
who
had
no
part
in
that
pleasant
company
i
stood
gloomily
by
the
rail
at
the
edge
of
the
ladies
awning
acutely
conscious
of
my
loneliness
presently
grey
whose
racing
was
over
came
to
us
and
had
a
favour
pinned
in
his
coat
by
elspeth
fingers
he
was
evidently
high
in
her
good
graces
for
he
sat
down
by
her
and
talked
gleefully
i
could
not
but
admire
his
handsome
eager
face
and
admit
with
a
bitter
grudge
that
you
would
look
long
to
find
a
comelier
pair
all
this
did
not
soothe
my
temper
and
after
an
hour
of
it
i
was
in
desperate
with
the
world
i
had
just
reached
the
conclusion
that
i
had
had
as
much
as
i
wanted
when
i
heard
elspeth
voice
calling
me
come
hither
garvald
she
said
we
have
a
dispute
which
a
third
must
settle
i
favour
the
cherry
and
grey
fancies
the
blue
but
i
maintain
that
blue
crowds
cherry
unfairly
at
the
corners
use
your
eyes
sir
at
the
next
turning
i
used
my
eyes
which
are
very
sharp
and
had
no
doubt
of
it
that
is
a
matter
for
the
master
of
the
course
said
grey
will
you
uphold
your
view
before
him
sir
i
said
that
i
knew
too
little
of
the
sport
to
be
of
much
weight
as
a
witness
to
this
he
said
nothing
but
offered
to
wager
with
me
on
the
result
of
the
race
which
was
now
all
but
ending
or
no
said
he
i
should
not
ask
you
that
a
trader
is
careful
of
his
guineas
elspeth
did
not
hear
being
intent
on
other
things
and
i
merely
shrugged
my
shoulders
though
my
fingers
itched
for
the
ears
in
a
little
the
racing
ceased
and
the
ladies
made
ready
to
leave
doctor
blair
appeared
protesting
that
the
place
was
not
for
his
cloth
and
gave
elspeth
his
arm
to
escort
her
to
his
coach
she
cried
a
merry
to
us
and
reminded
grey
that
he
had
promised
to
sup
with
them
on
the
morrow
when
she
had
gone
i
spied
a
lace
scarf
which
she
had
forgotten
and
picked
it
up
to
restore
it
this
did
not
please
the
other
he
snatched
it
from
me
and
when
i
proposed
to
follow
tripped
me
deftly
and
sent
me
sprawling
among
the
stools
as
i
picked
myself
up
i
saw
him
running
to
overtake
the
blairs
this
time
there
was
no
discreet
girl
to
turn
the
edge
of
my
fury
all
the
gibes
and
annoyances
of
the
past
months
rushed
into
my
mind
and
set
my
head
throbbing
i
was
angry
but
very
cool
with
it
all
for
i
saw
that
the
matter
had
now
gone
too
far
for
tolerance
unless
i
were
to
be
the
butt
of
virginia
i
must
assert
my
manhood
i
nicked
the
dust
from
my
coat
and
walked
quietly
to
where
grey
was
standing
amid
a
knot
of
his
friends
who
talked
of
the
races
and
their
losses
and
gains
he
saw
me
coming
and
said
something
which
made
them
form
a
staring
alley
down
which
i
strolled
he
kept
regarding
me
with
bright
watchful
eyes
i
have
been
very
patient
sir
i
said
but
there
is
a
limit
to
what
a
man
may
endure
from
a
mannerless
fool
and
i
gave
him
a
hearty
slap
on
the
face
instantly
there
was
a
dead
silence
in
which
the
sound
seemed
to
linger
intolerably
he
had
grown
very
white
and
his
eyes
were
wicked
i
am
obliged
to
you
sir
he
said
you
are
some
kind
of
ragged
gentleman
so
no
doubt
you
will
give
me
satisfaction
when
and
where
you
please
i
said
sedately
will
you
name
your
friend
now
he
asked
these
matters
demand
quick
settlement
to
whom
was
i
to
turn
i
knew
nobody
of
the
better
class
who
would
act
for
me
for
a
moment
i
thought
of
colonel
beverley
but
his
age
and
dignity
were
too
great
to
bring
him
into
this
squabble
of
youth
then
a
notion
struck
me
if
you
will
send
your
friend
to
my
man
john
faulkner
he
will
make
all
arrangements
he
is
to
be
found
any
day
in
my
shop
with
this
defiance
i
walked
nonchalantly
out
of
the
dumbfoundered
group
found
my
horse
and
rode
homewards
my
coolness
did
not
last
many
minutes
and
long
ere
i
had
reached
james
town
i
was
a
prey
to
dark
forebodings
here
was
i
a
peaceful
trader
who
desired
nothing
more
than
to
live
in
amity
with
all
men
involved
in
a
bloody
strife
i
had
sought
it
and
yet
it
had
been
none
of
my
seeking
i
had
graver
thoughts
to
occupy
my
mind
than
the
punctilios
of
idle
youth
and
yet
i
did
not
see
how
the
thing
could
have
been
shunned
it
was
my
hard
fate
to
come
athwart
an
obstacle
which
could
not
be
circumvented
but
must
be
broken
no
friend
could
help
me
in
the
business
not
ringan
nor
the
governor
nor
colonel
beverley
it
was
my
own
affair
which
i
must
go
through
with
alone
i
felt
as
solitary
as
a
pelican
remember
i
was
not
fighting
for
any
whimsy
about
honour
nor
even
for
the
love
of
elspeth
i
had
openly
provoked
grey
because
the
hostility
of
the
young
gentry
had
become
an
intolerable
nuisance
in
my
daily
life
so
with
such
pedestrian
reasons
in
my
mind
i
could
have
none
of
the
heady
enthusiasm
of
passion
i
wanted
him
and
his
kind
cleared
out
of
my
way
like
a
noisome
insect
but
i
had
no
flaming
hatred
of
him
to
give
me
heart
the
consequence
was
that
i
became
a
prey
to
dismal
fear
that
bravery
which
knows
no
ebb
was
never
mine
indeed
i
am
by
nature
timorous
for
my
fancy
is
quick
and
i
see
with
horrid
clearness
the
incidents
of
a
peril
only
a
shamefaced
conscience
holds
me
true
so
that
though
i
have
often
done
temerarious
deeds
it
has
always
been
because
i
feared
shame
more
than
the
risk
and
my
knees
have
ever
been
knocking
together
and
my
lips
dry
with
fright
i
tried
to
think
soberly
over
the
future
but
could
get
no
conclusion
save
that
i
would
not
do
murder
my
conscience
was
pretty
bad
about
the
whole
business
i
was
engaged
in
the
kind
of
silly
conflict
which
i
had
been
bred
to
abhor
i
had
none
of
the
common
gentleman
notions
about
honour
and
i
knew
that
if
by
any
miracle
i
slew
grey
i
should
be
guilty
in
my
own
eyes
of
murder
i
would
not
risk
the
guilt
if
god
had
determined
that
i
should
perish
before
my
time
then
perish
i
must
this
despair
brought
me
a
miserable
kind
of
comfort
when
i
reached
home
i
went
straight
to
faulkner
i
have
quarrelled
with
a
gentleman
john
and
have
promised
him
satisfaction
you
must
act
for
me
in
the
affair
some
one
will
come
to
see
you
this
evening
and
the
meeting
had
better
be
at
dawn
he
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
who
is
it
then
he
asked
charles
grey
of
grey
hundred
i
replied
this
made
him
whistle
low
he
a
fine
swordsman
he
said
i
never
heard
there
was
any
better
in
the
dominion
you
be
to
fight
with
swords
i
thought
hard
for
a
minute
i
was
the
challenged
and
so
had
the
choice
of
weapons
no
said
i
you
are
to
appoint
pistols
for
it
is
my
right
at
this
faulkner
slowly
grinned
it
a
new
weapon
for
these
affairs
what
if
they
not
accept
but
it
no
business
of
mine
and
remember
your
wishes
and
the
strange
fellow
turned
again
to
his
accounts
i
spent
the
evening
looking
over
my
papers
and
making
various
appointments
in
case
i
did
not
survive
the
morrow
happily
the
work
i
had
undertaken
for
lawrence
was
all
but
finished
and
of
my
ordinary
business
faulkner
knew
as
much
as
myself
i
wrote
a
letter
to
uncle
andrew
telling
him
frankly
the
situation
that
he
might
know
how
little
choice
i
had
it
was
a
job
making
these
dispositions
and
i
hope
never
to
have
the
like
to
do
again
presently
i
heard
voices
outside
and
faulkner
came
to
the
door
with
george
mason
the
younger
of
thornby
who
passed
for
the
chief
buck
in
virginia
he
gave
me
a
cold
bow
i
have
settled
everything
with
this
gentleman
but
i
would
beg
of
you
sir
to
reconsider
your
choice
of
arms
my
friend
will
doubtless
be
ready
enough
to
humour
you
but
you
have
picked
a
barbarous
weapon
for
christian
use
it
my
only
means
of
defence
i
said
then
you
stick
to
your
decision
assuredly
said
i
and
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
he
departed
i
did
not
attempt
to
sleep
faulkner
told
me
that
we
were
to
meet
the
next
morning
half
an
hour
after
sunrise
at
a
place
in
the
forest
a
mile
distant
each
man
was
to
fire
one
shot
but
two
pistols
were
allowed
in
case
of
a
misfire
all
that
night
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
i
got
my
weapons
ready
i
summoned
to
my
recollection
all
the
knowledge
i
had
acquired
and
made
sure
that
nothing
should
be
lacking
so
far
as
human
skill
would
go
i
had
another
pistol
besides
the
one
i
called
elspeth
also
made
in
glasgow
but
a
thought
longer
in
the
barrel
for
this
occasion
i
neglected
cartouches
and
loaded
in
the
old
way
i
tested
my
bullets
time
and
again
and
weighed
out
the
powder
as
if
it
had
been
gold
dust
it
was
short
range
so
i
made
my
charges
small
i
tried
my
old
device
of
wrapping
each
bullet
in
soft
wool
smeared
with
beeswax
all
this
passed
the
midnight
hours
and
then
i
lay
down
for
a
little
rest
but
not
for
sleep
i
was
glad
when
faulkner
summoned
me
half
an
hour
before
sunrise
i
remember
that
i
bathed
head
and
shoulders
in
cold
water
and
very
carefully
dressed
myself
in
my
best
clothes
my
pistols
lay
in
the
box
which
faulkner
carried
i
drank
a
glass
of
wine
and
as
we
left
i
took
a
long
look
at
the
place
i
had
created
and
the
river
now
lit
with
the
first
shafts
of
morning
i
wondered
incuriously
if
i
should
ever
see
it
again
my
tremors
had
all
gone
by
now
and
i
was
in
a
mood
of
cold
thoughtless
despair
the
earth
had
never
looked
so
bright
as
we
rode
through
the
green
aisles
all
filled
with
the
happy
song
of
birds
often
on
such
a
morning
i
had
started
on
a
journey
with
my
heart
grateful
for
the
goodness
of
the
world
could
i
but
keep
the
road
i
should
come
in
time
to
the
swampy
bank
of
the
york
and
then
would
follow
the
chestnut
forest
and
the
wide
marshes
towards
the
rappahannock
and
everywhere
i
should
meet
friendly
human
faces
and
then
at
night
i
should
eat
a
hunter
meal
below
the
stars
but
that
was
all
past
and
i
was
moving
towards
death
in
a
foolish
strife
in
which
i
had
no
heart
and
where
i
could
find
no
honour
i
think
i
laughed
aloud
at
my
exceeding
folly
we
turned
from
the
path
into
an
alley
which
led
to
an
open
space
on
the
edge
of
a
derelict
clearing
there
to
my
surprise
i
found
a
considerable
company
assembled
grey
was
there
with
his
second
and
a
dozen
or
more
of
his
companions
stood
back
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
the
young
blood
of
virginia
had
come
out
to
see
the
trader
punished
during
the
few
minutes
while
the
seconds
were
busy
pacing
the
course
and
arranging
for
the
signal
i
had
no
cognizance
of
the
world
around
me
i
stood
with
abstracted
eyes
watching
a
grey
squirrel
in
one
of
the
branches
and
trying
to
recall
a
line
i
had
forgotten
in
a
song
there
seemed
to
be
two
andrew
garvalds
that
morning
one
filled
with
an
immense
careless
peace
and
the
other
a
weak
creature
who
had
lived
so
long
ago
as
to
be
forgotten
i
started
when
faulkner
came
to
place
me
and
followed
him
without
a
word
but
as
i
stood
up
and
saw
grey
twenty
paces
off
turning
up
his
wristbands
and
tossing
his
coat
to
a
friend
i
realized
the
business
i
had
come
on
a
great
flood
of
light
was
rolling
down
the
forest
aisles
but
it
was
so
clear
and
pure
that
it
did
not
dazzle
i
remember
thinking
in
that
moment
how
intolerable
had
become
the
singing
of
birds
i
deadened
my
heart
to
memories
took
my
courage
in
both
hands
and
forced
myself
to
the
ordeal
for
it
is
an
ordeal
to
face
powder
if
you
have
not
a
dreg
of
passion
in
you
and
are
resolved
to
make
no
return
i
am
and
so
in
fronting
my
opponent
i
exposed
my
heart
if
grey
were
the
marksman
i
thought
him
now
was
his
chance
for
revenge
my
wits
were
calm
now
and
my
senses
very
clear
i
heard
a
man
say
slowly
that
he
would
count
three
and
then
drop
his
kerchief
and
at
the
dropping
we
should
fire
our
eyes
were
on
him
as
he
lifted
his
hand
and
slowly
began
one
two
then
i
looked
away
for
the
signal
mattered
nothing
to
me
i
suddenly
caught
grey
eyes
and
something
whistled
past
my
ear
cutting
the
lobe
and
shearing
off
a
lock
of
hair
i
did
not
heed
it
what
filled
my
mind
was
the
sight
of
my
enemy
very
white
and
drawn
in
the
face
holding
a
smoking
pistol
and
staring
at
me
i
emptied
my
pistol
among
the
no
one
moved
grey
continued
to
stare
leaning
a
little
forward
with
his
lips
working
then
i
took
from
faulkner
my
second
pistol
my
voice
came
out
of
my
throat
funnily
cracked
as
if
from
long
disuse
grey
i
cried
i
would
not
have
you
think
that
i
can
not
shoot
forty
yards
from
me
on
the
edge
of
the
covert
a
turkey
stood
with
its
foolish
inquisitive
head
the
sound
of
the
shots
had
brought
the
bird
out
to
see
what
was
going
on
it
stood
motionless
blinking
its
eyes
the
very
mark
i
desired
i
pointed
to
it
with
my
right
hand
flung
forward
my
pistol
and
fired
it
rolled
over
as
dead
as
stone
and
faulkner
walked
to
pick
it
up
he
put
back
my
pistols
in
the
box
and
we
turned
to
seek
the
horses
then
grey
came
up
to
me
his
mouth
was
but
the
lines
were
not
of
pride
i
saw
that
he
too
had
been
desperately
afraid
and
i
rejoiced
that
others
beside
me
had
been
at
our
quarrel
is
at
an
end
sir
he
said
and
his
voice
was
hesitating
why
yes
i
said
it
was
never
my
seeking
though
i
gave
the
offence
i
have
behaved
like
a
cub
sir
and
he
spoke
loud
so
that
all
could
hear
you
have
taught
me
a
lesson
in
gentility
will
you
give
me
your
hand
i
could
find
no
words
and
dumbly
held
out
my
right
hand
nay
sir
he
said
the
other
the
one
that
held
the
trigger
i
count
it
a
privilege
to
hold
the
hand
of
a
brave
man
i
had
been
tried
too
hard
and
was
all
but
proving
my
bravery
by
weeping
like
a
bairn
chapter
xiv
a
wild
wager
that
july
morning
in
the
forest
gave
me
if
not
popularity
at
any
rate
peace
i
had
made
good
my
position
henceforth
the
word
went
out
that
i
was
to
be
let
alone
some
of
the
young
men
indeed
showed
signs
of
affecting
my
society
including
that
kent
of
gracedieu
who
had
been
stripped
by
ringan
the
others
treated
me
with
courtesy
and
i
replied
with
my
best
manners
most
of
them
were
of
a
different
world
to
mine
and
we
could
not
mix
so
was
right
that
our
deportment
should
be
that
of
two
dissimilar
but
amiable
nations
bowing
to
each
other
across
a
frontier
all
this
was
a
great
ease
but
it
brought
one
rueful
consequence
elspeth
grew
cold
to
me
women
i
suppose
have
to
condescend
and
protect
and
pity
when
i
was
an
outcast
she
was
ready
to
shelter
me
but
now
that
i
was
in
some
degree
of
favour
with
others
the
need
for
this
was
gone
and
she
saw
me
without
illusion
in
all
my
angularity
and
roughness
she
must
have
heard
of
the
duel
and
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
the
quarrel
had
been
about
herself
which
was
not
the
truth
the
notion
irked
her
pride
that
her
name
should
ever
be
brought
into
the
brawls
of
men
when
i
passed
her
in
the
streets
she
greeted
me
coldly
and
all
friendliness
had
gone
out
of
her
eyes
my
days
were
so
busy
that
i
had
little
leisure
for
brooding
but
at
odd
moments
i
would
fall
into
a
deep
melancholy
she
had
lived
so
constantly
in
my
thoughts
that
without
her
no
project
charmed
me
what
mattered
wealth
or
fame
i
thought
if
she
did
not
approve
what
availed
my
striving
if
she
were
not
to
share
in
the
reward
i
was
in
this
mood
when
i
was
bidden
by
doctor
blair
to
sup
at
his
house
i
went
thither
in
much
trepidation
for
i
feared
a
great
company
in
which
i
might
have
no
chance
of
a
word
from
her
but
i
found
only
the
governor
who
was
in
a
black
humour
and
disputed
every
word
that
fell
from
the
doctor
mouth
this
turned
the
meal
into
one
long
wrangle
in
which
the
high
fundamentals
of
government
in
church
and
state
were
debated
by
two
choleric
gentlemen
the
girl
and
i
had
no
share
in
the
conversation
indeed
we
were
clearly
out
of
place
so
she
could
not
refuse
when
i
proposed
a
walk
in
the
garden
the
place
was
all
cool
and
dewy
after
the
scorching
day
and
the
bells
of
the
flowers
made
the
air
heavy
with
fragrance
somewhere
near
a
man
was
playing
on
the
flageolet
a
light
pretty
tune
which
set
her
feet
tripping
i
asked
her
bluntly
wherein
i
had
offended
offended
she
cried
why
should
i
take
offence
i
see
you
once
in
a
blue
moon
you
flatter
yourself
strangely
garvald
if
you
think
you
are
ever
in
my
thoughts
you
are
never
out
of
mine
i
said
dismally
at
this
she
laughed
something
of
the
old
elfin
laughter
which
i
had
heard
on
the
wet
moors
a
compliment
she
cried
to
be
mixed
up
eternally
with
the
weights
of
tobacco
and
the
prices
of
flemish
lace
you
are
growing
a
very
pretty
courtier
sir
i
am
no
courtier
i
said
i
think
brave
things
of
you
though
i
have
not
the
words
to
fit
them
but
one
thing
i
will
say
to
you
since
ever
you
sang
to
the
boy
that
once
was
me
your
spell
has
been
on
my
soul
and
when
i
saw
you
again
three
months
back
that
spell
was
changed
from
the
whim
of
youth
to
what
men
call
love
oh
i
know
well
there
is
no
hope
for
me
i
am
not
fit
to
tie
your
but
you
have
made
a
fire
in
my
cold
life
and
you
will
pardon
me
if
i
dare
warm
my
hands
the
sun
is
brighter
because
of
you
and
the
flowers
fairer
and
the
birds
song
sweeter
grant
me
this
little
boon
that
i
may
think
of
you
have
no
fears
that
i
will
pester
you
with
attentions
no
priest
ever
served
his
goddess
with
a
remoter
reverence
than
mine
for
you
she
stopped
in
an
alley
of
roses
and
looked
me
in
the
face
in
the
dusk
i
could
not
see
her
eyes
fine
words
she
said
yet
i
hear
that
you
have
been
wrangling
over
me
with
charles
grey
and
exchanging
pistol
shots
is
that
your
reverence
in
a
sentence
i
told
her
the
truth
they
forced
my
back
to
the
wall
i
said
and
there
was
no
other
way
i
have
never
uttered
your
name
to
a
living
soul
was
it
my
fancy
that
when
she
spoke
again
there
was
a
faint
accent
of
disappointment
you
are
an
uncomfortable
being
garvald
it
seems
you
are
predestined
to
keep
virginia
from
sloth
for
myself
i
am
for
the
roses
and
the
old
quiet
ways
she
plucked
two
flowers
one
white
and
one
of
deepest
crimson
i
pardon
you
she
said
and
for
token
i
will
give
you
a
rose
it
is
red
for
that
is
your
turbulent
colour
the
white
flower
of
peace
shall
be
mine
i
took
the
gift
and
laid
it
in
my
bosom
two
days
later
it
being
a
monday
i
dined
with
his
excellency
at
the
governor
house
at
middle
plantation
the
place
had
been
built
new
for
my
lord
culpepper
since
the
old
mansion
at
james
town
had
been
burned
in
bacon
rising
the
company
was
mainly
of
young
men
but
three
ladies
the
mistresses
of
arlington
and
cobwell
manors
and
elspeth
in
a
new
saffron
gown
varied
with
their
laces
the
rich
coats
of
the
men
i
was
pleasantly
welcomed
by
everybody
grey
came
forward
and
greeted
me
very
quiet
and
civil
and
i
sat
by
him
throughout
the
meal
the
governor
was
in
high
good
humour
and
presently
had
the
whole
company
in
the
same
mood
of
them
all
elspeth
was
the
merriest
she
had
the
quickest
wit
and
the
deftest
skill
in
mimicry
and
there
was
that
in
her
laughter
which
would
infect
the
glummest
that
very
day
i
had
finished
my
preparations
the
train
was
now
laid
and
the
men
were
ready
and
a
word
from
lawrence
would
line
the
west
with
muskets
but
i
had
none
of
the
satisfaction
of
a
completed
work
it
was
borne
in
upon
me
that
our
task
was
scarcely
begun
and
that
the
peril
that
threatened
us
was
far
darker
than
we
had
dreamed
tale
of
a
white
leader
among
the
tribes
was
always
in
my
head
the
hall
where
we
sat
was
lined
with
portraits
of
men
who
had
borne
rule
in
virginia
there
was
captain
john
smith
and
bronzed
and
argall
and
dale
grave
and
soldierly
there
was
francis
wyat
with
the
scar
got
in
indian
wars
there
hung
the
mean
and
sallow
countenance
of
sir
john
harvey
there
too
was
berkeley
with
his
high
complexion
and
his
the
great
gentleman
of
a
vanished
age
and
the
gross
rotundity
of
culpepper
and
the
furtive
eye
of
my
lord
howard
who
was
even
now
the
reigning
governor
there
was
a
noble
picture
of
king
charles
the
second
who
alone
of
monarchs
was
represented
lackeys
carried
viands
and
wines
and
the
table
was
a
mingling
of
silver
and
roses
the
afternoon
light
came
soft
through
the
trellis
and
you
could
not
have
looked
for
a
fairer
picture
of
settled
ease
yet
i
had
that
in
my
mind
which
shattered
the
picture
we
were
feasting
like
the
old
citizens
of
buried
pompeii
with
the
lava
even
now
perhaps
flowing
hot
from
the
mountains
i
looked
at
the
painted
faces
on
the
walls
and
wondered
which
i
would
summon
to
our
aid
if
i
could
call
men
from
the
dead
smith
i
thought
would
be
best
but
i
reflected
uneasily
that
smith
would
never
have
let
things
come
to
such
a
pass
at
the
first
hint
of
danger
he
would
have
been
off
to
the
west
to
scotch
it
in
the
egg
i
was
so
filled
with
sober
reflections
that
i
talked
little
but
there
was
no
need
of
me
youth
and
beauty
reigned
and
the
governor
was
as
gay
as
the
youngest
many
asked
me
to
take
wine
with
them
and
the
compliment
pleased
me
there
was
singing
likewise
sir
william
davenant
song
to
his
mistress
and
a
cavalier
rant
or
two
and
a
throat
ditty
of
the
seas
and
elspeth
sang
very
sweetly
the
old
air
of
greensleeves
we
drank
all
the
toasts
of
fashion
his
majesty
of
england
confusion
to
the
french
the
health
of
virginia
rich
harvests
full
cellars
and
pretty
dames
presently
when
we
had
waxed
very
cheerful
and
wine
had
risen
to
several
young
heads
the
governor
called
on
us
to
brim
our
glasses
be
it
known
gentlemen
and
you
fair
ladies
he
cried
that
is
a
more
auspicious
occasion
than
any
royal
festival
or
christian
holy
day
is
dulcinea
birthday
i
summon
you
to
drink
to
the
flower
of
the
west
the
brightest
gem
in
virginia
coronal
at
that
we
were
all
on
our
feet
the
gentlemen
snapped
the
stems
of
their
glasses
to
honour
the
sacredness
of
the
toast
and
there
was
such
a
shouting
and
pledging
as
might
well
have
turned
a
girl
head
elspeth
sat
still
and
smiling
the
mockery
had
gone
out
of
her
eyes
and
i
thought
they
were
wet
no
queen
had
ever
a
nobler
salutation
and
my
heart
warmed
to
the
generous
company
whatever
its
faults
it
did
due
homage
to
beauty
and
youth
governor
francis
was
again
on
his
feet
i
have
a
birthday
gift
for
the
fair
one
you
must
know
that
once
at
whitehall
i
played
at
cartes
with
my
lord
culpepper
and
the
stake
on
his
part
was
portion
of
that
virginian
territory
which
is
his
freehold
i
won
and
my
lord
conveyed
the
grant
to
me
in
a
deed
properly
attested
by
the
attorneys
we
call
the
place
the
northern
neck
and
is
all
the
land
between
the
rappahannock
and
the
potomac
as
far
west
as
the
sunset
it
is
undivided
but
my
lord
stipulated
that
my
portion
should
lie
from
the
mountains
westward
what
good
is
such
an
estate
to
an
aging
bachelor
like
me
who
can
never
visit
it
but
is
a
fine
inheritance
for
youth
and
i
propose
to
convey
it
to
dulcinea
as
a
birthday
gift
some
day
i
doubt
not
be
the
eden
of
america
at
this
there
was
a
great
crying
out
and
some
laughter
which
died
away
when
it
appeared
that
the
governor
spoke
in
all
seriousness
i
make
one
condition
he
went
on
twenty
years
back
there
was
an
old
hunter
called
studd
who
penetrated
the
mountains
he
travelled
to
the
of
the
rapidan
and
pierced
the
hills
by
a
pass
which
he
christened
clearwater
gap
he
climbed
the
highest
mountain
in
those
parts
and
built
a
cairn
on
the
summit
in
which
he
hid
a
with
a
writing
within
he
was
the
first
to
make
the
journey
and
none
have
followed
him
the
man
is
dead
now
but
he
told
me
the
tale
and
i
will
pledge
my
honour
that
it
is
true
it
is
for
dulcinea
to
choose
a
champion
to
follow
studd
path
and
bring
back
his
on
the
day
i
receive
it
she
takes
sasine
of
her
heritage
which
of
you
gallants
offers
for
the
venture
to
this
day
i
do
not
know
what
were
francis
nicholson
motives
he
wished
the
mountains
crossed
but
he
can
not
have
expected
to
meet
a
pathfinder
among
the
youth
of
the
tidewater
i
think
it
was
the
whim
of
the
moment
he
would
endow
elspeth
and
at
the
same
time
test
her
cavaliers
to
the
ordinary
man
it
seemed
the
craziest
folly
studd
had
been
a
wild
fellow
half
indian
in
blood
and
wholly
indian
in
habits
and
for
another
to
travel
fifty
miles
into
the
heart
of
the
desert
was
to
embrace
destruction
the
company
sat
very
silent
elspeth
with
a
blushing
cheek
turned
troubled
eyes
on
the
speaker
as
for
me
i
had
found
the
chance
i
wanted
i
was
on
my
feet
in
a
second
i
will
go
i
said
and
i
had
hardly
spoken
when
grey
was
beside
me
crying
and
i
still
the
company
sat
silent
was
as
if
the
shadow
of
a
sterner
life
had
come
over
their
young
gaiety
elspeth
did
not
look
at
me
but
sat
with
eyes
plucking
feverishly
at
a
rose
the
governor
laughed
out
loud
brave
hearts
he
cried
will
you
travel
together
i
looked
at
grey
that
can
hardly
be
he
said
well
we
must
spin
for
it
said
nicholson
taking
a
guinea
from
his
pocket
royals
for
garvald
quarters
for
grey
he
cried
as
he
spun
it
it
fell
royals
we
had
both
been
standing
and
grey
now
bowed
to
me
and
sat
down
his
face
was
very
pale
and
his
lips
tightly
shut
the
governor
gave
a
last
toast
let
us
drink
he
called
to
dulcinea
champion
and
the
fortunes
of
his
journey
at
that
there
was
such
applause
you
might
have
thought
me
the
man
in
the
dominion
i
looked
at
elspeth
but
she
averted
her
eyes
as
we
left
the
table
i
stepped
beside
grey
you
must
come
with
me
i
whispered
nay
do
not
refuse
when
you
know
all
you
will
come
gladly
and
i
appointed
a
meeting
on
the
next
day
at
the
tavern
i
got
to
my
house
at
the
darkening
and
found
ringan
waiting
for
me
this
time
he
had
not
sought
a
disguise
but
he
kept
his
fiery
head
covered
with
a
broad
hat
and
the
collar
of
his
seaman
coat
enveloped
his
lower
face
to
a
in
the
dusk
he
must
have
seemed
an
ordinary
ship
captain
stretching
his
legs
on
land
he
asked
for
food
and
drink
and
i
observed
that
his
manner
was
very
grave
are
things
in
train
andrew
he
asked
i
told
him
to
the
last
stirrup
buckle
it
as
well
said
he
for
the
trouble
has
begun
then
he
told
me
a
horrid
tale
the
rapidan
is
a
stream
in
the
north
of
the
dominion
flowing
into
the
rappahannock
on
its
south
bank
two
years
past
a
family
of
french
folk
was
their
name
had
made
a
home
in
a
meadow
by
that
stream
and
built
a
house
and
a
strong
stockade
for
they
were
in
dangerous
nearness
to
the
hills
and
had
no
neighbours
within
forty
miles
they
were
gentlefolk
of
some
substance
and
had
carved
out
of
the
wilderness
a
very
pretty
manor
with
orchards
and
flower
gardens
i
had
never
been
to
the
place
but
i
had
heard
the
praise
of
it
from
dwellers
on
the
rappahannock
no
indians
came
near
them
and
there
they
abode
happy
in
their
solitude
a
husband
and
wife
three
little
children
two
french
servants
and
a
dozen
negroes
a
week
ago
tragedy
had
come
like
a
thunderbolt
at
night
the
stockade
was
broke
and
the
family
woke
from
sleep
to
hear
the
and
see
by
the
light
of
their
blazing
byres
a
band
of
painted
savages
it
seems
that
no
resistance
was
possible
and
they
were
butchered
like
sheep
the
babes
were
pierced
with
stakes
the
grown
folk
were
scalped
and
tortured
and
by
sunrise
in
that
peaceful
clearing
there
was
nothing
but
ashes
word
had
come
down
the
rappahannock
ringan
said
he
had
heard
it
in
accomac
and
had
sailed
to
sabine
to
make
sure
men
had
ridden
out
from
stafford
county
and
found
no
more
than
a
child
toy
and
some
bloody
garments
who
did
it
i
asked
with
fury
rising
in
my
heart
it
cherokee
work
there
nothing
strange
in
it
except
that
such
a
deed
should
have
been
dared
but
it
means
the
beginning
of
our
business
think
the
stafford
folk
will
sleep
in
their
beds
after
that
and
that
precisely
what
perplexes
me
the
governor
will
be
bound
to
send
an
expedition
against
the
murderers
and
they
not
be
easy
found
but
while
the
militia
are
routing
about
on
the
rapidan
what
hinders
the
big
invasion
to
come
down
the
james
or
the
chickahominy
or
the
pamunkey
or
the
mattaponey
and
find
a
defenceless
tidewater
as
i
see
it
there
deep
guile
in
this
business
a
cherokee
murder
is
nothing
out
of
the
way
but
these
blackguards
were
not
killing
for
mere
pleasure
as
i
said
before
i
would
give
my
right
hand
to
have
better
information
it
this
land
business
that
fickles
one
if
it
were
a
matter
of
islands
and
ocean
bays
i
would
have
long
ago
riddled
out
the
heart
of
it
we
on
the
way
to
get
news
i
said
and
i
told
him
of
my
wager
that
evening
man
andrew
he
cried
it
providential
there
nothing
to
hinder
you
and
me
and
a
few
others
to
ride
clear
into
the
hills
with
the
tidewater
thinking
it
no
more
than
a
play
of
daft
young
men
you
must
see
nicholson
and
get
him
to
hold
his
hand
till
we
send
him
word
in
two
days
lawrence
will
be
here
and
we
can
post
our
lads
on
each
of
the
rivers
for
it
likely
any
indian
raid
will
take
one
of
the
valleys
you
must
see
that
governor
of
yours
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
get
him
to
promise
to
wait
on
your
news
then
he
can
get
out
his
militia
and
stir
up
the
tidewater
will
he
do
it
think
you
i
said
i
thought
he
would
and
there
one
other
thing
would
he
agree
to
turning
a
blind
eye
to
lawrence
if
he
comes
back
he
not
trouble
them
in
james
town
but
he
the
only
man
alive
to
direct
our
own
lads
i
said
i
would
try
but
i
was
far
from
certain
it
was
hard
to
forecast
the
mind
of
governor
francis
well
lawrence
will
come
whether
or
no
you
can
sound
the
man
and
if
he
dour
let
the
matter
be
lawrence
is
now
on
the
roanoke
and
his
plan
is
to
send
out
the
word
and
gather
in
the
posts
come
to
frew
place
on
the
south
fork
river
which
is
about
the
middle
of
the
frontier
line
is
monday
the
word
will
go
out
by
friday
the
men
will
be
ready
and
lawrence
will
be
in
virginia
the
sooner
you
off
the
better
andrew
what
do
you
say
to
wednesday
that
day
will
suit
me
fine
i
said
but
what
about
my
company
the
fewer
the
better
who
were
you
thinking
of
you
for
one
i
said
and
shalah
for
a
second
he
nodded
i
want
two
men
from
the
rappahannock
a
hunter
of
the
name
of
donaldson
and
the
frenchman
bertrand
that
makes
five
would
you
like
to
even
the
number
yes
i
said
there
a
gentleman
of
the
tidewater
charles
grey
that
i
bidden
to
the
venture
ringan
whistled
are
you
sure
that
wise
there
be
little
use
for
braw
clothes
and
fine
manners
in
the
hills
all
the
same
there
be
a
use
for
grey
when
will
you
join
us
i
a
bit
of
business
to
do
hereaways
but
i
catch
you
up
look
for
me
at
aird
store
on
thursday
morning
chapter
xv
i
gather
the
clans
i
was
at
the
governor
house
next
day
before
he
had
breakfasted
he
greeted
me
laughingly
has
the
champion
come
to
cry
forfeit
he
asked
it
is
a
long
sore
road
to
the
hills
mr
garvald
i
come
to
make
confession
i
said
and
i
plunged
into
my
story
of
the
work
of
the
last
months
he
heard
me
with
lowering
brows
who
the
devil
made
you
governor
of
this
dominion
sir
you
have
been
levying
troops
without
his
permission
your
offence
is
no
less
than
high
treason
i
a
pretty
mind
to
send
you
to
the
i
implore
you
to
hear
me
patiently
i
cried
then
i
told
him
what
i
had
learned
in
the
carolinas
and
at
the
outland
farms
you
yourself
told
me
it
was
hopeless
to
look
for
a
guinea
from
the
council
i
was
but
carrying
out
your
desires
can
you
blame
me
if
i
toiled
for
the
public
weal
and
neglected
my
own
fortunes
he
was
scarcely
appeased
you
a
damnable
kind
of
busybody
sir
the
breed
of
fellow
that
plunges
states
into
revolutions
why
in
name
did
you
not
consult
me
because
it
was
wiser
not
to
i
said
stoutly
half
my
recruits
are
old
soldiers
of
bacon
if
the
trouble
blows
past
they
go
back
to
their
steadings
and
nothing
more
is
heard
of
it
if
trouble
comes
who
are
such
natural
defenders
of
the
dominion
as
the
frontier
dwellers
all
i
have
done
is
to
give
them
the
sinews
of
war
but
if
governor
nicholson
had
taken
up
the
business
and
it
were
known
that
he
had
leaned
on
old
rebels
what
would
the
council
say
what
would
have
been
the
view
of
my
lord
howard
and
the
wiseacres
in
london
he
said
nothing
but
knit
his
brows
my
words
were
too
much
in
tune
with
his
declared
opinions
for
him
to
gainsay
them
it
comes
to
this
then
he
said
at
length
you
have
raised
a
body
of
men
who
are
waiting
marching
orders
what
next
mr
garvald
the
next
thing
is
to
march
after
what
befell
on
the
rapidan
we
can
not
sit
still
he
started
i
have
heard
nothing
of
it
then
i
told
him
the
horrid
tale
he
got
to
his
feet
and
strode
up
and
down
the
room
with
his
dark
face
working
god
mercy
what
a
calamity
i
knew
the
folk
they
came
here
with
letters
from
his
grace
of
shrewsbury
are
you
certain
your
news
is
true
alas
there
is
no
doubt
stafford
county
is
in
a
ferment
and
the
next
post
from
the
york
will
bring
you
word
then
by
god
it
is
for
me
to
move
no
council
or
assembly
will
dare
gainsay
me
i
can
order
a
levy
by
virtue
of
his
majesty
commission
i
have
come
to
pray
you
to
hold
your
hand
till
i
send
you
better
intelligence
i
said
his
brows
knit
again
but
this
is
too
much
am
i
to
refrain
from
doing
my
duty
till
i
get
your
gracious
consent
sir
nay
nay
i
cried
do
not
misunderstand
me
this
thing
is
far
graver
than
you
think
sir
if
you
send
your
levies
to
the
rapidan
you
leave
the
tidewater
defenceless
and
while
you
are
hunting
a
cherokee
party
in
the
north
the
enemy
will
be
hammering
at
your
gates
what
enemy
he
asked
i
do
not
know
and
that
is
what
i
go
to
find
out
then
i
told
him
all
i
had
gathered
about
the
unknown
force
in
the
hills
and
the
apparent
strategy
of
a
campaign
which
was
beyond
an
indian
wits
there
is
a
white
man
at
the
back
of
it
i
said
a
white
man
who
talks
in
bible
words
and
is
mad
for
devastation
his
face
had
grown
very
solemn
he
went
to
a
bureau
unlocked
it
and
took
from
a
drawer
a
bit
of
paper
which
he
tossed
to
me
i
had
that
a
week
past
my
servant
got
it
from
an
indian
in
the
woods
it
was
a
dirty
scrap
folded
like
a
letter
and
bearing
the
superscription
the
man
francis
nicholson
presently
governor
in
i
opened
it
and
read
comest
to
me
with
a
sword
and
with
a
spear
and
with
a
shield
but
i
come
to
thee
in
the
name
of
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
the
armies
of
israel
whom
thou
hast
there
i
cried
there
is
proof
of
my
fears
what
kind
of
indian
sends
a
message
like
that
trust
me
sir
there
is
a
far
more
hellish
mischief
brewing
than
any
man
wots
of
it
looks
not
unlike
it
he
said
grimly
now
let
hear
what
you
propose
i
can
have
my
men
at
their
posts
by
the
week
end
we
will
string
them
out
along
the
frontier
and
hold
especially
the
river
valleys
if
invasion
comes
then
at
any
rate
the
tidewater
will
get
early
news
of
it
meantime
i
and
my
friends
looking
for
studd
with
a
mind
to
confirm
your
birthday
gift
to
miss
elspeth
blair
will
push
on
to
the
hills
and
learn
what
is
to
be
learned
there
you
will
never
come
back
he
said
tartly
an
indian
stake
and
a
bloody
head
will
be
the
end
of
all
of
you
maybe
i
said
though
i
have
men
with
me
that
can
play
the
indian
game
but
if
in
ten
days
time
from
now
you
get
no
word
then
you
can
fear
the
worst
and
set
your
militia
going
i
have
a
service
of
posts
which
will
carry
news
to
you
as
quick
as
a
carrier
pigeon
whatever
we
learn
you
shall
hear
of
without
delay
and
you
can
make
your
dispositions
accordingly
if
the
devils
find
us
first
then
get
in
touch
with
my
men
at
frew
homestead
on
the
south
fork
river
for
that
will
be
the
headquarters
of
the
frontier
army
who
will
be
in
command
there
when
you
are
gallivanting
in
the
hills
he
asked
one
whose
name
had
better
not
be
spoken
he
lies
under
sentence
of
death
by
virginian
law
but
believe
me
he
is
an
honest
soul
and
a
good
patriot
and
he
is
the
one
man
born
to
lead
these
outland
troops
he
smiled
his
christian
name
is
richard
maybe
i
think
i
know
your
outlaw
but
let
it
pass
i
ask
no
names
in
these
bad
times
we
can
not
afford
to
despise
any
man
aid
he
pulled
out
a
chart
of
virginia
and
i
marked
for
him
our
posts
and
indicated
the
line
of
my
own
journey
have
you
ever
been
in
the
wars
mr
garvald
he
asked
i
told
him
no
well
you
have
a
very
pretty
natural
gift
for
the
military
art
your
men
will
screen
the
frontier
line
and
behind
that
screen
i
will
get
our
militia
force
in
order
while
meantime
you
are
reconnoitring
the
enemy
it
a
very
fair
piece
of
strategy
but
i
am
mortally
certain
you
yourself
will
never
come
back
the
odd
thing
was
that
at
that
moment
i
did
not
fear
for
myself
i
had
lived
so
long
with
my
scheme
that
i
had
come
to
look
upon
it
almost
like
a
trading
venture
in
which
one
calculates
risks
and
gains
on
paper
and
thinks
no
more
of
it
i
had
none
of
the
black
fright
which
i
had
suffered
before
my
meeting
with
grey
happily
though
a
young
thoughts
may
be
long
his
fancy
takes
short
views
i
was
far
more
concerned
with
what
might
happen
in
my
absence
in
the
tidewater
than
with
our
fate
in
the
hills
it
is
a
gamble
i
said
but
the
stakes
are
noble
and
i
have
a
private
pride
in
its
success
also
the
goad
of
certain
bright
eyes
he
said
smiling
little
i
thought
when
i
made
that
offer
last
night
i
was
setting
so
desperate
a
business
in
train
there
was
a
good
providence
in
that
for
now
we
can
give
out
that
you
are
gone
on
a
madcap
ploy
and
there
will
be
no
sleepless
nights
in
the
tidewater
i
must
keep
their
souls
easy
for
once
they
are
scared
there
will
be
such
a
spate
of
letters
to
new
york
as
will
weaken
the
courage
of
our
northern
brethren
for
the
militia
i
will
give
the
excuse
of
the
french
menace
the
good
folk
will
laugh
at
me
for
it
but
they
will
not
take
fright
god
truth
but
it
is
a
devilish
tangle
i
could
wish
i
had
your
part
sir
and
be
free
to
ride
out
on
a
gallant
venture
here
i
have
none
of
the
zest
of
war
but
only
a
thousand
cares
and
the
carking
task
of
soothing
fools
we
spoke
of
many
things
and
i
gave
him
a
full
account
of
the
composition
and
strength
of
our
levies
when
i
left
he
paid
me
a
compliment
which
coming
from
so
sardonic
a
soul
gave
me
peculiar
comfort
i
have
seen
something
of
men
and
cities
sir
he
said
and
i
know
well
the
foibles
and
the
strength
of
my
countrymen
but
i
have
never
met
your
equal
for
cold
persistence
you
are
a
trader
and
have
turned
war
into
a
trading
venture
i
do
believe
that
when
you
are
at
your
last
gasp
you
will
be
found
calmly
casting
up
your
accounts
with
life
and
i
think
you
will
find
a
balance
on
the
right
side
god
speed
you
garvald
i
love
your
sober
folly
i
had
scarcely
left
him
when
i
met
a
servant
of
the
blairs
who
handed
me
a
letter
was
from
elspeth
the
first
she
had
ever
written
me
i
tore
it
open
and
found
a
very
disquieting
epistle
clearly
she
had
written
it
in
a
white
heat
of
feeling
spoke
finely
of
she
wrote
how
you
had
never
named
my
name
to
a
mortal
soul
but
you
have
put
me
to
open
shame
you
have
offered
yourself
for
a
service
which
i
did
not
seek
what
care
i
for
his
excellency
gifts
shall
it
be
said
that
i
was
the
means
of
sending
a
man
into
deadly
danger
to
secure
me
a
foolish
estate
you
have
offended
me
grossly
and
i
pray
you
spare
me
further
offence
i
command
you
to
give
up
this
journey
i
will
not
have
my
name
bandied
about
in
this
land
as
a
wanton
who
sets
silly
youth
by
the
ears
to
gratify
her
pride
if
you
desire
to
retain
a
shred
of
my
friendship
go
to
his
excellency
and
tell
him
that
by
my
orders
you
withdraw
from
the
wager
this
letter
did
not
cloud
my
spirits
as
it
should
for
one
thing
she
signed
it
elspeth
and
for
another
i
had
the
conceited
notion
that
what
moved
her
most
was
the
thought
that
i
was
running
into
danger
i
longed
to
have
speech
with
her
but
i
found
from
the
servant
that
doctor
blair
had
left
that
morning
on
a
journey
of
pastoral
visitation
and
had
taken
her
with
him
the
man
did
not
know
their
destination
but
believed
it
to
be
somewhere
in
the
north
the
thought
vaguely
disquieted
me
in
these
perilous
times
i
wished
to
think
of
her
as
safe
in
the
coastlands
where
a
ship
would
give
a
sure
refuge
i
met
grey
that
afternoon
at
the
tavern
in
the
last
week
he
seemed
to
have
aged
and
grown
graver
there
was
now
no
hint
of
the
light
arrogance
of
old
he
regarded
me
curiously
but
without
hostility
we
have
been
enemies
i
said
and
now
though
there
may
be
no
friendship
at
any
rate
there
is
a
truce
to
strife
last
night
i
begged
of
you
to
come
with
me
on
this
matter
of
the
governor
wager
but
not
the
wager
i
thought
of
then
i
told
him
the
whole
tale
the
stake
is
the
safety
of
this
land
of
which
you
are
a
notable
citizen
i
ask
you
because
i
know
you
are
a
brave
man
will
you
leave
your
comfort
and
your
games
for
a
season
and
play
for
higher
stakes
at
a
more
desperate
hazard
i
told
him
everything
even
down
to
my
talk
with
the
governor
i
did
not
lessen
the
risks
and
hardships
and
i
gave
him
to
know
that
his
companions
would
be
rough
folk
whom
he
may
well
have
despised
he
heard
me
out
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
then
suddenly
he
raised
a
shining
face
you
are
a
generous
enemy
garvald
i
behaved
to
you
like
a
peevish
child
and
you
retaliate
by
offering
me
the
bravest
venture
that
man
ever
conceived
i
am
with
you
with
all
my
heart
by
god
sir
i
am
sick
of
my
cushioned
life
this
is
what
i
have
been
longing
for
in
my
soul
since
i
was
born
that
night
i
spent
making
ready
i
took
no
servant
and
in
my
was
stored
the
little
i
needed
of
powder
and
shot
i
had
plenty
and
my
two
pistols
and
my
hunting
musket
i
gave
faulkner
instructions
and
wrote
a
letter
to
my
uncle
to
be
sent
if
i
did
not
return
next
morning
at
daybreak
we
took
the
road
chapter
xvi
the
ford
of
the
rapidan
was
the
same
high
summer
weather
through
which
i
had
ridden
a
fortnight
ago
with
a
dull
heart
on
my
way
to
the
duel
now
grey
rode
by
my
side
and
my
spirits
were
as
light
as
a
bird
i
had
forgotten
the
grim
part
of
the
enterprise
the
fate
that
might
await
me
the
horrors
we
should
certainly
witness
i
thought
only
of
the
joys
of
movement
into
new
lands
with
tried
companions
these
last
months
i
had
borne
a
pretty
heavy
weight
of
cares
now
that
was
past
my
dispositions
completed
the
thing
was
in
the
hands
of
god
and
i
was
free
to
go
my
own
road
and
thrushes
cried
in
the
thickets
squirrels
flirted
across
the
path
and
now
and
then
a
shy
deer
fled
before
us
there
come
moments
to
every
man
when
he
is
thankful
to
be
alive
and
every
breath
drawn
is
a
delight
so
at
that
hour
i
praised
my
maker
for
his
good
earth
and
for
sparing
me
to
rejoice
in
it
grey
had
met
me
with
a
certain
shyness
but
as
the
sun
rose
and
the
land
grew
bright
he
too
lost
his
constraint
and
fell
into
the
same
happy
mood
soon
we
were
smiling
at
each
other
in
the
frankest
comradeship
we
two
who
but
the
other
day
had
carried
ourselves
like
he
had
forgotten
his
fine
manners
and
his
mincing
london
voice
and
we
spoke
of
the
outland
country
of
which
he
knew
nothing
and
of
the
hunting
of
game
of
which
he
knew
much
exchanging
our
different
knowledges
and
willing
to
learn
from
each
other
long
ere
we
had
reached
york
ferry
i
had
found
that
there
was
much
in
common
between
the
scots
trader
and
the
virginian
cavalier
and
the
chief
thing
we
shared
was
youth
mine
to
be
sure
was
more
in
the
heart
while
grey
wore
his
open
and
fearless
he
plucked
the
summer
flowers
and
set
them
in
his
hat
he
was
full
of
catches
and
glees
so
that
he
waked
the
echoes
in
the
forest
glades
soon
i
too
fell
to
singing
in
my
tuneless
voice
and
i
answered
his
my
lodging
is
on
the
cold
ground
with
some
scots
ballad
or
a
song
of
davie
lindsay
i
remember
how
sweetly
he
sang
colonel
lovelace
ode
to
lucasta
writ
when
going
to
the
wars
true
a
new
mistress
now
i
chase
the
first
foe
in
the
field
and
with
a
stronger
faith
embrace
a
sword
a
horse
a
shield
yet
this
inconstancy
is
such
as
thou
too
shalt
adore
i
could
not
love
thee
dear
so
much
loved
i
not
honour
more
i
wondered
if
that
were
my
case
if
i
rode
out
for
honour
and
not
for
the
pure
pleasure
of
the
riding
and
i
marvelled
more
to
see
the
two
of
us
both
lovers
of
one
lady
and
eager
rivals
burying
for
the
nonce
our
feuds
and
with
the
same
hope
serving
the
same
cause
we
slept
the
night
at
aird
store
and
early
the
next
morning
found
ringan
a
new
ringan
indeed
as
unlike
the
buccaneer
i
knew
as
he
was
unlike
the
quaker
he
was
now
the
gentleman
of
breadalbane
dressed
for
the
part
with
all
the
care
of
an
exquisite
he
rode
a
noble
roan
in
his
spanish
belt
were
stuck
pistols
and
a
long
sword
swung
at
his
side
when
i
presented
grey
to
him
he
became
at
once
the
cavalier
as
precise
in
his
speech
and
polite
in
his
deportment
as
any
whitehall
courtier
they
talked
high
and
disposedly
of
genteel
matters
and
you
would
have
thought
that
that
pirate
had
lived
his
life
among
proud
lords
and
ladies
that
is
ever
the
way
of
the
highlander
he
alters
like
a
clear
pool
to
every
mood
of
the
sky
so
that
the
shallow
observer
might
forget
how
deep
the
waters
are
presently
when
we
had
ridden
into
the
chestnut
forests
of
the
mattaponey
he
began
to
forget
his
part
grey
it
appeared
was
a
student
of
campaigns
and
he
and
ringan
were
deep
in
a
discussion
of
conde
battles
in
which
both
showed
surprising
knowledge
but
the
glory
of
the
weather
and
of
the
woodlands
new
as
they
were
to
a
seafarer
set
his
thoughts
wandering
and
he
fell
to
tales
of
his
past
which
consorted
ill
with
his
former
decorum
there
was
a
madcap
zest
in
his
speech
something
so
merry
and
wild
that
grey
who
had
fallen
back
into
his
tidewater
manners
became
once
more
the
careless
boy
we
stopped
to
eat
in
a
glade
by
a
slow
stream
and
from
his
ringan
brought
out
strange
delicacies
there
were
sugared
fruits
from
the
main
and
orange
sirop
from
jamaica
and
a
kind
of
sweet
punch
made
by
the
hispaniola
indians
as
we
ate
and
drank
he
would
gossip
about
the
ways
of
the
world
and
though
he
never
mentioned
his
own
doings
there
was
such
an
air
of
mastery
about
him
as
made
him
seem
the
centre
figure
of
his
tales
i
could
see
that
grey
was
mightily
captivated
and
all
afternoon
he
plied
him
with
questions
and
laughed
joyously
at
his
answers
as
we
camped
that
night
while
grey
was
minding
his
horse
ringan
spoke
of
him
to
me
i
like
the
lad
andrew
he
has
the
makings
of
a
very
proper
gentleman
and
he
has
the
sense
to
be
young
what
i
complain
of
in
you
is
that
you
desperate
old
i
wonder
whiles
if
you
ever
were
a
laddie
for
me
though
i
ten
years
the
elder
of
the
pair
of
you
i
no
more
years
than
your
friend
and
i
a
century
younger
than
you
that
the
highland
way
there
that
in
our
blood
that
keeps
our
eyes
young
though
we
may
be
bent
double
with
us
the
heart
is
aye
leaping
till
death
grips
us
to
my
mind
it
a
lovable
character
that
i
fain
would
cherish
if
i
could
sing
on
a
spring
morning
or
say
a
hearty
grace
over
a
good
dinner
i
be
content
to
be
put
away
in
a
graveyard
and
that
i
think
is
the
truth
but
at
the
time
i
was
feeling
pretty
youthful
too
though
my
dour
face
and
hard
voice
were
a
bad
clue
to
my
sentiments
next
day
on
the
rappahannock
we
found
shalah
who
had
gone
on
to
warn
the
two
men
i
proposed
to
enlist
one
of
them
donaldson
was
a
big
farmer
the
same
who
had
been
with
bacon
in
the
fight
at
occaneechee
island
he
just
cried
to
his
wife
to
expect
him
back
when
she
saw
him
slung
on
his
back
an
old
musket
cast
a
long
leg
over
his
little
horse
and
was
ready
to
follow
the
other
the
frenchman
bertrand
was
a
quiet
slim
gentleman
who
was
some
kin
to
the
murdered
i
had
long
had
my
eye
on
him
for
he
was
very
wise
in
woodcraft
and
had
learned
campaigning
under
old
turenne
he
kissed
his
two
children
again
and
again
and
his
wife
clung
to
his
arms
there
were
tears
in
the
honest
fellow
eyes
as
he
left
and
i
thought
all
the
more
of
him
for
he
is
the
bravest
man
who
has
most
to
risk
i
mind
that
ringan
consoled
the
lady
in
the
french
tongue
which
i
did
not
comprehend
and
would
not
be
hindered
from
getting
out
his
and
comforting
the
children
with
candied
plums
he
had
near
as
grave
a
face
as
bertrand
when
we
rode
off
and
was
always
looking
back
to
the
homestead
he
spoke
long
to
the
frenchman
in
his
own
speech
and
the
sad
face
of
the
latter
began
to
lighten
i
asked
him
what
he
said
just
that
he
was
the
happy
man
to
have
kind
hearts
to
weep
for
him
a
fine
thing
for
a
landless
childless
fellow
like
me
to
say
but
gospel
truth
andrew
i
told
him
that
his
bairns
would
be
great
folks
some
day
and
that
their
proudest
boast
would
be
that
their
father
had
ridden
on
this
errand
oh
and
all
the
rest
of
the
easy
consolations
if
it
had
been
me
i
would
not
have
been
muckle
cheered
it
well
i
never
married
for
i
would
not
have
had
the
courage
to
leave
my
fireside
we
were
now
getting
into
a
new
and
far
lovelier
country
the
heavy
forests
and
swamps
which
line
the
james
and
the
york
had
gone
and
instead
we
had
rolling
spaces
of
green
meadowland
and
little
hills
which
stood
out
like
sentinels
of
the
great
blue
chain
of
mountains
that
hung
in
the
west
instead
of
the
rich
summer
scents
of
the
tidewater
we
had
the
clean
sharp
smell
of
uplands
and
cool
winds
relieved
the
noontide
heat
by
and
by
we
struck
the
rapidan
a
water
more
like
our
scots
rivers
flowing
in
pools
and
currents
very
different
from
the
stagnant
reaches
of
the
pamunkey
we
were
joined
for
a
little
bit
by
two
men
from
stafford
county
who
showed
us
the
paths
that
horses
could
travel
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
that
we
reached
a
broad
meadow
hemmed
in
by
noble
cedars
i
knew
without
telling
that
we
were
come
to
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
and
with
one
accord
we
fell
silent
the
place
had
been
well
looked
after
for
a
road
had
been
made
through
the
woods
and
had
been
carried
over
marshy
places
on
a
platform
of
cedar
piles
presently
we
came
to
a
log
fence
with
a
gate
which
hung
idly
open
within
was
a
paddock
and
beyond
another
fence
and
beyond
that
a
great
pile
of
blackened
timber
the
place
was
so
smiling
and
homelike
under
the
westering
sun
that
one
looked
to
see
a
trim
steading
with
the
smoke
of
hearth
fires
ascending
and
to
hear
the
cheerful
sounds
of
labour
and
of
children
voices
instead
there
was
this
grim
charred
heap
with
the
light
winds
swirling
the
ashes
every
man
of
us
uncovered
his
head
as
he
rode
towards
the
melancholy
place
i
noticed
a
little
rosary
which
had
been
carefully
tended
but
horses
had
ridden
through
it
and
the
blossoms
were
trailing
crushed
on
the
ground
there
was
a
flower
garden
too
much
trampled
and
in
one
corner
a
little
stream
of
water
had
been
led
into
a
pool
fringed
with
a
tiny
was
turning
in
the
fall
a
children
toy
and
the
wheel
still
turned
though
its
owners
had
gone
the
sight
of
that
simple
thing
fairly
brought
my
heart
to
my
mouth
that
inspection
was
a
gruesome
business
one
of
the
doorposts
of
the
house
still
stood
and
it
was
splashed
with
blood
on
the
edge
of
the
ashes
were
some
charred
human
bones
no
one
could
tell
whose
they
were
perhaps
a
negro
perhaps
the
little
mistress
of
the
i
looked
at
ringan
and
he
was
smiling
but
his
eyes
were
terrible
the
frenchman
bertrand
was
sobbing
like
a
child
we
took
the
bones
and
made
a
shallow
grave
for
them
in
the
rosary
we
had
no
spades
but
a
stake
did
well
enough
to
dig
a
for
those
few
poor
remains
i
said
over
them
the
psalm
though
i
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
i
will
fear
no
evil
for
thou
art
with
me
thy
rod
and
thy
staff
shall
comfort
then
suddenly
our
mood
changed
nothing
that
we
could
do
could
help
the
poor
souls
whose
bones
lay
among
the
ashes
but
we
could
bring
their
murderers
to
book
and
save
others
from
a
like
fate
we
moved
away
from
the
shattered
place
to
the
ford
in
the
river
where
the
road
ran
north
there
we
looked
back
a
kind
of
fury
seized
me
as
i
saw
that
cruel
defacement
in
a
few
hours
we
ourselves
should
be
beyond
the
pale
among
those
human
wolves
who
were
so
much
more
relentless
than
any
beasts
of
the
field
as
i
looked
round
our
little
company
i
noted
how
deep
the
thing
had
bitten
into
our
souls
ringan
eyes
still
danced
with
that
unholy
blue
light
grey
was
very
pale
and
his
jaw
was
set
grimly
bertrand
had
ceased
from
sobbing
and
his
face
had
the
wildness
of
the
fanatic
such
a
look
as
his
forbears
may
have
worn
at
the
news
of
bartholomew
the
big
man
donaldson
looked
puzzled
and
sombre
only
shalah
stood
impassive
and
aloof
with
no
trace
of
feeling
on
the
bronze
of
his
countenance
this
is
the
place
for
an
oath
i
said
we
are
six
men
against
an
army
but
we
fight
for
a
holy
cause
let
us
swear
to
wipe
out
this
deed
of
blood
in
the
blood
of
its
perpetrators
god
has
made
us
the
executors
of
his
judgments
against
horrid
cruelty
we
swore
holding
our
hands
high
that
when
our
duty
to
the
dominion
was
done
we
should
hunt
down
the
cherokees
who
had
done
this
deed
till
no
one
of
them
was
left
breathing
at
that
moment
of
tense
nerves
no
other
purpose
would
have
contented
us
how
will
we
find
them
quoth
ringan
to
sift
a
score
of
murderers
out
of
a
murderous
nation
will
be
like
searching
the
ocean
for
a
wave
then
shalah
spoke
the
trail
is
ten
suns
old
but
i
can
follow
it
the
men
were
of
the
meebaw
tribe
by
this
token
and
he
held
up
a
goshawk
feather
the
bird
that
dropped
that
lives
beyond
the
peaks
of
shubash
the
meebaw
are
quick
hunters
and
gross
eaters
and
travel
slow
we
will
find
them
by
the
tewawha
all
in
good
time
i
said
retribution
must
wait
till
we
have
finished
our
task
can
you
find
the
meebaw
men
again
yea
said
shalah
though
they
took
wings
and
flew
over
the
seas
i
should
find
them
then
we
hastened
away
from
that
glade
none
speaking
to
the
other
we
camped
an
hour
ride
up
the
river
in
a
place
secure
against
surprises
in
a
crook
of
the
stream
with
a
great
rock
at
our
back
we
were
outside
the
pale
now
and
must
needs
adopt
the
precautions
of
a
campaign
so
we
split
the
night
into
watches
i
did
my
two
hours
sentry
duty
at
that
dead
moment
of
the
dark
just
before
the
little
breeze
which
is
the
precursor
of
dawn
and
i
reflected
very
soberly
on
the
slender
chances
of
our
returning
from
this
strange
wild
world
and
its
cruel
mysteries
chapter
xvii
i
retrace
my
steps
next
morning
we
passed
through
the
foothills
into
an
open
meadow
country
as
i
lifted
up
my
eyes
i
saw
for
the
first
time
the
mountains
near
at
hand
there
they
lay
not
more
than
ten
miles
distant
woody
almost
to
the
summit
but
with
here
and
there
a
bold
finger
of
rock
pointing
skywards
they
looked
infinitely
high
and
rugged
far
higher
than
any
hills
i
had
ever
seen
before
for
my
own
tinto
or
cairntable
would
to
these
have
been
no
more
than
a
footstool
i
made
out
a
clear
breach
in
the
range
which
i
took
to
be
old
studd
clearwater
gap
the
whole
sight
intoxicated
me
i
might
dream
of
horrors
in
the
low
coast
forests
among
their
swampy
creeks
but
in
that
clear
high
world
of
the
hills
i
believed
lay
safety
i
could
have
gazed
at
them
for
hours
but
shalah
would
permit
of
no
delay
he
hurried
us
across
the
open
meadows
and
would
not
relax
his
pace
till
we
were
on
a
low
wooded
ridge
with
the
young
waters
of
the
rapidan
running
in
a
shallow
vale
beneath
here
we
halted
in
a
thick
clump
of
cedars
while
he
and
ringan
went
forward
to
spy
out
the
land
in
that
green
darkness
save
by
folk
travelling
along
the
ridge
we
could
not
be
detected
and
i
knew
enough
of
indian
ways
to
believe
that
any
large
party
would
keep
the
stream
sides
we
lit
a
fire
without
fear
for
the
smoke
was
hid
in
the
cedar
branches
and
some
of
us
roasted
our
food
in
the
would
not
last
long
and
i
foresaw
a
ticklish
business
when
it
came
to
hunting
for
the
pot
a
gunshot
in
these
narrow
glens
would
reverberate
like
a
cannon
we
dozed
peacefully
in
the
green
shade
and
smoked
our
pipes
waiting
for
the
return
of
our
envoys
they
came
towards
sundown
slipping
among
us
like
ghosts
ringan
signalled
to
me
and
we
put
our
coats
over
the
horses
heads
to
prevent
their
whinnying
he
stamped
out
the
last
few
ashes
of
the
fire
and
shalah
motioned
us
all
flat
on
our
faces
then
i
crawled
to
the
edge
of
the
ridge
and
looked
down
through
a
tangle
of
vines
on
the
little
valley
our
precautions
had
been
none
too
soon
for
a
host
was
passing
below
as
stealthily
as
if
it
had
been
an
army
of
the
sheeted
dead
most
were
mounted
and
it
was
marvellous
to
see
the
way
in
which
they
managed
their
horses
so
that
the
beasts
seemed
part
of
the
riders
and
partook
of
their
vigilance
some
were
on
foot
and
moved
with
the
long
loping
indian
stride
i
guessed
their
number
at
three
hundred
but
what
awed
me
was
their
array
this
was
no
ordinary
raid
but
an
invading
army
my
sight
as
i
think
i
have
said
is
as
keen
as
a
hawk
and
i
could
see
that
most
of
them
carried
muskets
as
well
as
knives
and
tomahawks
the
glistened
on
each
breast
and
forehead
and
in
the
oiled
hair
stood
the
crested
feathers
dyed
scarlet
for
battle
my
spirits
sank
as
i
reflected
that
now
we
were
cut
off
from
the
tidewater
when
the
last
man
had
gone
we
crawled
back
to
the
clump
now
gloomy
with
the
dusk
of
evening
i
saw
that
ringan
was
very
weary
but
shalah
after
stretching
his
long
limbs
seemed
fresh
as
ever
will
you
come
with
me
brother
he
said
we
must
warn
the
rappahannock
who
are
they
i
asked
cherokees
more
follow
them
the
assault
is
dearly
by
the
line
of
the
rappahannock
if
we
hasten
we
may
yet
be
in
time
i
knew
what
shalah
hastening
meant
i
suppose
i
was
the
one
of
us
best
fitted
for
a
march
and
that
that
was
the
reason
why
the
indian
chose
me
all
the
same
my
heart
misgave
me
he
ate
a
little
food
while
i
stripped
off
the
garments
i
did
not
need
carrying
only
the
one
pistol
i
bade
the
others
travel
slowly
towards
the
mountains
scouting
carefully
ahead
and
promised
that
we
should
join
them
before
the
next
sundown
then
shalah
beckoned
me
and
i
plunged
after
him
into
the
forest
on
our
first
visit
to
ringan
at
the
carolina
harbour
i
had
thought
shalah
pace
killing
but
that
was
but
a
saunter
to
what
he
now
showed
me
we
seemed
to
be
moving
at
right
angles
to
the
indian
march
once
out
of
the
woods
of
the
ridge
we
crossed
the
meadows
mostly
on
our
bellies
taking
advantage
of
every
howe
and
crinkle
i
followed
him
as
obediently
as
a
child
when
he
ran
so
did
i
when
he
crawled
my
forehead
was
next
his
heel
after
the
came
broken
hillocks
with
little
streams
in
the
bottoms
through
these
we
twisted
moving
with
less
care
and
presently
we
had
left
the
hills
and
were
looking
over
a
wide
shadowy
plain
the
moon
was
full
and
was
just
beginning
to
climb
the
sky
shalah
sniffed
the
wind
which
blew
from
the
and
set
off
at
a
sharp
angle
towards
the
north
we
were
now
among
the
woods
again
and
the
tangled
undergrowth
tried
me
sore
we
had
been
going
for
about
three
hours
and
though
i
was
hard
and
spare
from
much
travel
in
the
sun
my
legs
were
not
used
to
this
furious
foot
marching
my
feet
grew
leaden
and
to
make
matters
worse
we
dipped
presently
into
a
big
swamp
where
we
mired
to
the
knees
and
often
to
the
middle
it
would
have
been
no
light
labour
at
any
time
to
cross
such
a
place
pulling
oneself
by
the
tangled
shrubs
on
to
the
rare
patches
of
solid
ground
but
now
when
i
was
pretty
weary
the
toil
was
about
the
limit
of
my
strength
when
we
emerged
on
hard
land
i
was
sobbing
like
a
stricken
deer
but
shalah
had
no
mercy
he
took
me
through
the
dark
cedars
at
the
same
tireless
pace
and
in
the
gloom
i
could
see
him
flitting
ahead
of
me
his
shoulders
squared
and
his
limbs
as
supple
as
a
i
remember
i
said
over
in
my
head
all
the
songs
and
verses
i
knew
to
keep
my
mind
from
my
condition
i
had
long
ago
got
and
lost
my
second
wind
and
whatever
other
winds
there
be
and
was
moving
less
by
bodily
strength
than
by
sheer
doggedness
of
spirit
weak
tears
were
running
down
my
cheeks
my
breath
rasped
in
my
throat
but
i
was
in
the
frame
of
mind
that
if
death
had
found
me
next
moment
my
legs
would
still
have
twitched
in
an
effort
to
run
at
an
open
bit
of
the
forest
shalah
stopped
and
looked
at
the
sky
i
blundered
into
him
and
then
from
sheer
weakness
rolled
on
the
ground
he
grunted
and
turned
to
me
i
felt
his
cool
hand
passing
over
my
brow
and
cheek
and
his
fingers
kneading
the
muscles
of
my
forlorn
legs
was
some
indian
device
doubtless
but
its
power
was
miraculous
under
his
hands
my
body
seemed
to
be
rested
and
revived
new
strength
stole
into
my
sinews
new
vigour
into
my
blood
the
thing
took
maybe
five
minutes
not
more
but
i
scrambled
to
my
feet
a
man
again
indeed
i
was
a
better
man
than
when
i
started
for
this
indian
wizardry
had
given
me
an
odd
lightness
of
head
and
heart
when
we
took
up
the
running
my
body
instead
of
a
leaden
clog
seemed
to
be
a
thing
of
air
and
feathers
it
was
now
hard
on
midnight
and
the
moon
was
high
in
the
heavens
we
bore
somewhat
to
the
right
and
i
judged
that
our
circuit
was
completed
and
that
the
time
had
come
to
steal
in
front
of
the
indian
route
the
forest
thinned
and
we
traversed
a
marshy
piece
of
country
with
many
single
great
trees
often
shalah
would
halt
for
a
second
strain
his
ears
and
sniff
the
light
wind
like
a
dog
he
seemed
to
find
guidance
but
i
got
none
only
the
hoot
of
an
owl
or
the
rooty
smell
of
the
woodland
at
last
we
struck
a
little
stream
and
followed
its
course
between
high
banks
of
pine
suddenly
shalah
movements
became
stealthy
crouching
in
every
patch
of
shade
and
crossing
open
spaces
on
our
bellies
we
turned
from
the
stream
surmounted
a
knoll
and
came
down
on
a
wooded
valley
shalah
looked
westwards
held
up
his
hand
and
stood
poised
for
a
minute
like
a
graven
image
then
he
grunted
and
spoke
we
are
safe
he
said
they
are
behind
us
and
are
camped
for
the
night
how
he
knew
that
i
can
not
tell
but
i
seemed
to
catch
on
the
breeze
a
whiff
of
the
rancid
odour
of
indian
for
another
mile
we
continued
our
precautions
and
then
moved
more
freely
in
the
open
now
that
the
chief
peril
was
past
my
fatigue
came
back
to
me
worse
than
ever
i
think
i
was
growing
as
i
had
seen
happen
to
horses
and
from
that
ailment
there
is
no
relief
my
head
buzzed
like
a
beehive
and
when
the
moon
set
i
had
no
power
to
pick
my
steps
and
stumbled
and
sprawled
in
the
darkness
i
had
to
ask
shalah
for
help
though
it
was
a
sore
hurt
to
my
pride
and
leaning
on
his
arm
i
made
the
rest
of
the
journey
i
found
myself
splashing
in
a
strong
river
we
crossed
by
a
ford
so
we
had
no
need
to
swim
which
was
well
for
me
for
i
must
have
drowned
the
chill
of
the
water
revived
me
somewhat
and
i
had
the
strength
to
climb
the
other
bank
and
then
suddenly
before
me
i
saw
a
light
and
a
challenge
rang
out
into
the
night
the
voice
was
a
white
man
and
brought
me
to
my
bearings
weak
as
i
was
i
had
the
fierce
satisfaction
that
our
errand
had
not
been
idle
i
replied
with
the
password
and
a
big
fellow
strode
out
from
a
stockade
mr
garvald
he
said
staring
what
brings
you
here
where
are
the
rest
of
you
he
looked
at
shalah
and
then
at
me
and
finally
took
my
arm
and
drew
me
inside
there
were
a
score
in
the
place
rappahannock
farmers
a
lean
watchful
breed
each
man
with
his
musket
one
of
them
i
mind
wore
a
rusty
cuirass
of
chain
armour
which
must
have
been
one
of
those
sent
out
by
the
king
in
the
first
days
of
the
dominion
they
gave
me
a
drink
of
rum
and
water
and
in
a
little
i
had
got
over
my
worst
weariness
and
could
speak
the
cherokees
are
on
us
i
said
and
i
told
them
of
the
army
we
had
followed
how
many
they
asked
three
hundred
for
a
vanguard
but
more
follow
one
man
laughed
as
if
well
pleased
i
in
the
humour
for
cherokees
just
now
there
a
score
of
scalps
hanging
outside
if
you
could
see
them
mr
garvald
what
scalps
i
asked
dumbfoundered
the
rapidan
murderers
we
got
word
of
them
in
the
woods
yesterday
and
six
of
us
went
hunting
it
was
pretty
shooting
two
got
away
with
some
lead
in
them
the
rest
are
in
the
tewawha
pools
all
but
their
topknots
i
very
little
notion
of
cherokees
somehow
the
news
gave
me
intense
joy
i
thought
nothing
of
the
barbarity
of
it
or
that
white
men
should
demean
themselves
to
the
indian
level
i
remembered
only
the
meadow
by
the
rapidan
and
the
little
lonely
our
vow
was
needless
for
others
had
done
our
work
would
i
had
been
with
you
was
all
i
said
but
now
you
have
more
than
a
gang
of
meebaw
raiders
to
deal
with
there
an
invasion
coming
down
from
the
hills
and
this
is
the
first
wave
of
it
i
want
word
sent
to
governor
nicholson
at
james
town
i
was
to
tell
him
where
the
trouble
was
to
be
feared
and
in
a
week
you
have
a
regiment
at
your
backs
who
has
the
best
horse
simpson
well
let
simpson
carry
the
word
down
the
valley
if
my
plans
are
working
well
the
news
should
be
at
james
town
by
dawn
the
man
called
simpson
got
up
saddled
his
beast
and
waited
my
bidding
this
is
the
word
to
send
said
i
say
that
the
cherokees
are
attacking
by
the
line
of
the
rappahannock
say
that
i
am
going
into
the
hills
to
find
if
my
fears
are
justified
never
mind
what
that
means
just
pass
on
the
words
they
will
understand
them
at
james
town
so
much
for
the
governor
now
i
want
word
sent
to
frew
homestead
on
the
south
fork
who
is
to
carry
it
one
old
fellow
who
chewed
tobacco
without
intermission
spat
out
the
leaf
and
asked
me
what
news
i
wanted
to
send
just
that
we
are
attacked
i
said
that
a
simple
job
he
said
cheerfully
all
down
the
border
posts
we
have
a
signal
only
yesterday
we
got
word
of
it
from
the
place
you
speak
of
a
mile
from
here
is
a
hillock
within
hearing
of
the
stockade
at
robertson
ford
one
shot
fired
there
will
tell
them
what
you
want
them
to
know
robertson
will
fire
twice
for
appleby
to
hear
and
appleby
will
send
on
the
message
to
dopple
there
are
six
posts
between
here
and
the
south
fork
so
when
the
folk
at
frew
hear
seven
shots
they
will
know
that
the
war
is
on
the
rappahannock
i
recognized
old
lawrence
hand
in
this
it
was
just
the
kind
of
device
that
he
would
contrive
i
hoped
it
would
not
miscarry
for
i
would
have
preferred
a
messenger
but
after
all
the
border
line
was
his
concern
then
i
spoke
aside
to
shalah
in
his
view
the
cherokees
would
not
attack
at
dawn
they
were
more
likely
to
wait
till
their
supports
overtook
them
and
then
to
make
a
dash
for
the
rappahannock
farms
plunder
was
more
in
the
line
of
these
gentry
than
honest
fighting
i
spoke
to
the
leader
of
the
post
and
he
was
for
falling
upon
them
in
the
narrows
of
the
rapidan
their
victory
over
the
meebaws
had
fired
the
blood
of
the
borderers
and
made
them
contemptuous
of
the
enemy
still
in
such
a
predicament
when
we
had
to
hold
a
frontier
with
a
handful
the
boldest
course
was
likely
to
be
the
safest
i
could
only
pray
that
nicholson
levies
would
turn
up
in
time
to
protect
the
valley
time
passes
brother
said
shalah
we
came
by
swiftness
but
we
return
by
guile
in
three
hours
it
will
be
dawn
sleep
till
then
for
there
is
much
toil
before
thee
i
saw
the
wisdom
of
his
words
and
went
promptly
to
bed
in
a
corner
of
the
stockade
as
i
was
lying
down
a
man
spoke
to
me
one
rycroft
at
whose
cabin
i
had
once
sojourned
for
a
day
what
brings
the
parson
hereaways
in
these
times
he
asked
what
parson
i
asked
the
man
they
call
doctor
blair
great
god
i
cried
what
about
him
he
was
in
stafford
county
when
i
left
hunting
for
schoolmasters
ay
and
he
had
a
girl
with
him
i
sat
upright
with
a
start
where
is
he
now
i
asked
i
saw
him
last
at
middleton
ford
i
think
he
was
going
down
the
river
i
warned
him
this
was
no
place
for
parsons
and
women
but
he
just
laughed
at
me
it
time
he
was
back
in
the
tidewater
so
long
as
they
were
i
did
not
care
but
it
gave
me
a
queer
fluttering
of
the
heart
to
think
that
elspeth
but
yesterday
should
have
been
near
this
perilous
border
i
soon
fell
asleep
for
i
was
mighty
tired
but
i
dreamed
evilly
i
seemed
to
see
doctor
blair
hunted
by
cherokees
with
his
flying
and
his
wig
blown
away
and
what
vexed
me
was
that
i
could
not
find
elspeth
anywhere
in
the
landscape
chapter
xviii
our
adventure
receives
a
recruit
at
earliest
light
with
the
dew
heavy
on
the
willows
and
the
river
line
a
coil
of
mist
shalah
woke
me
for
the
road
we
breakfasted
off
fried
bacon
some
of
which
i
saved
for
the
journey
for
the
indian
was
content
with
one
meal
a
day
as
we
left
the
stockade
i
noted
the
row
of
meebaw
scalps
hanging
grim
and
bloody
from
the
poles
the
borderers
were
up
and
stirring
for
they
looked
to
take
the
indians
in
the
river
narrows
before
the
morning
was
old
no
two
indian
war
parties
ever
take
the
same
path
so
it
was
plan
to
work
back
to
the
route
we
had
just
travelled
by
which
the
cherokees
had
come
yesterday
this
sounds
simple
enough
but
the
danger
lay
in
the
second
party
by
striking
to
right
or
left
we
might
walk
into
it
and
then
to
our
hopes
of
the
hills
but
the
whole
thing
was
easier
to
me
than
the
cruel
toil
of
yesterday
there
was
need
of
stealth
and
woodcraft
but
not
of
yon
killing
speed
for
the
first
hour
we
went
up
a
northern
fork
of
the
rappahannock
then
crossed
the
water
at
a
ford
and
struck
into
a
thick
pine
forest
i
was
feeling
wonderfully
rested
and
found
no
discomfort
in
shalah
long
strides
my
mind
was
very
busy
on
the
defence
of
the
borders
and
i
kept
wondering
how
long
the
governor
militia
would
take
to
reach
the
rappahannock
and
whether
lawrence
could
reinforce
the
northern
posts
in
time
to
prevent
mischief
in
stafford
county
i
cast
back
to
my
memory
of
the
tales
of
indian
war
and
could
not
believe
but
that
the
white
man
if
warned
and
armed
would
roll
back
the
cherokees
was
not
them
i
feared
but
that
other
force
now
screened
behind
the
mountains
who
had
for
their
leader
some
white
madman
with
a
fire
in
his
head
and
bible
words
on
his
lips
were
we
of
virginia
destined
to
fight
with
such
fanatics
as
had
distracted
scotland
fanatics
naming
the
name
of
god
but
leading
in
our
case
the
armies
of
hell
it
was
about
eleven
in
the
forenoon
i
think
that
shalah
dropped
his
easy
swing
and
grew
circumspect
the
sun
was
very
hot
and
the
noon
silence
lay
dead
on
the
woodlands
scarcely
a
leaf
stirred
and
the
only
sounds
were
the
twittering
grasshoppers
and
the
drone
of
flies
but
shalah
found
food
for
thought
again
and
again
he
became
rigid
and
then
laid
an
ear
to
the
ground
his
nostrils
dilated
like
a
horse
and
his
eyes
were
restless
we
were
now
in
a
shallow
vale
through
which
a
little
stream
flowed
among
broad
at
one
point
he
kneeled
on
the
ground
and
searched
diligently
see
he
said
a
horse
prints
not
two
hours
old
a
horse
going
west
presently
i
myself
found
a
clue
i
picked
up
from
a
clump
of
wild
onions
a
thread
of
coloured
wool
this
was
my
own
trade
where
i
knew
more
than
shalah
i
tested
the
thing
in
my
mouth
and
between
my
fingers
this
is
london
stuff
i
said
the
man
who
had
this
on
his
person
bought
his
clothes
from
the
bristol
merchants
and
paid
sweetly
for
them
he
was
no
rappahannock
farmer
shalah
trailed
like
a
bloodhound
following
the
out
of
the
valley
meadow
to
a
ridge
of
sparse
cedars
where
they
showed
clear
on
the
bare
earth
and
then
to
a
thicker
covert
where
they
were
hidden
among
strong
grasses
suddenly
he
caught
my
shoulder
and
pulled
me
to
the
ground
we
crawled
through
a
briery
place
to
where
a
gap
opened
to
the
vale
on
our
left
a
party
of
indians
were
passing
they
were
young
men
with
the
fantastic
markings
of
young
braves
all
were
mounted
on
the
little
indian
horses
they
moved
at
leisure
scanning
the
distance
with
hands
shading
eyes
we
wormed
our
way
back
to
the
darkness
of
the
covert
the
advance
guard
of
the
second
party
shalah
whispered
with
good
fortune
we
shall
soon
see
the
rest
pass
and
then
have
a
clear
road
for
the
hills
i
saw
no
fresh
scalps
i
said
so
they
seem
to
have
missed
our
man
on
the
horse
i
was
proud
of
my
simple
logic
all
that
shalah
replied
was
the
rider
was
a
woman
how
in
heaven
name
can
you
tell
i
asked
he
held
out
a
long
hair
i
found
it
among
the
vines
at
the
level
of
a
rider
head
this
was
bad
news
indeed
what
folly
had
induced
a
woman
to
ride
so
far
across
the
borders
it
could
be
no
settler
wife
but
some
dame
from
the
coast
country
who
had
not
the
sense
to
be
timid
was
a
grievous
affliction
for
two
men
on
an
arduous
quest
to
have
to
protect
a
foolish
female
with
the
cherokees
all
about
them
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
as
swiftly
as
possible
and
with
all
circumspection
shalah
trailed
the
horse
prints
they
kept
the
high
ground
in
very
broken
country
which
was
the
reason
why
the
rider
had
escaped
the
indians
notice
clearly
they
were
moving
slowly
and
from
the
frequent
halts
and
turnings
i
gathered
that
the
rider
had
not
much
purpose
about
the
road
then
we
came
on
a
glade
where
the
rider
had
dismounted
and
let
the
beast
go
the
horse
had
wandered
down
the
ridge
to
the
right
in
search
of
grazing
and
the
prints
of
a
woman
foot
led
to
the
summit
of
a
knoll
which
raised
itself
above
the
trees
there
in
a
patch
of
fern
i
saw
what
i
had
never
dreamed
of
what
sent
the
blood
from
my
heart
in
a
cold
shudder
of
fear
a
girl
pale
and
dishevelled
was
trying
to
part
some
vines
a
twig
crackled
and
she
looked
round
showing
a
face
drawn
with
weariness
and
eyes
large
with
terror
it
was
elspeth
at
the
sight
of
shalah
she
made
to
scream
but
checked
herself
it
was
well
for
a
scream
would
have
brought
all
of
us
to
instant
death
for
shalah
at
that
moment
dropped
to
earth
and
wriggled
into
a
covert
overlooking
the
vale
i
had
the
sense
to
catch
the
girl
and
pull
her
after
him
he
stopped
dead
and
we
two
lay
also
like
mice
my
heart
was
going
pretty
fast
and
i
could
feel
the
heaving
of
her
bosom
the
shallow
glen
was
full
of
folk
most
of
them
going
on
foot
i
recognized
the
cherokee
and
the
long
hickory
bows
which
those
carried
who
had
no
muskets
was
by
far
the
biggest
party
we
had
seen
and
though
in
that
moment
i
had
no
wits
to
count
them
shalah
told
me
afterwards
they
must
have
numbered
little
short
of
a
thousand
some
very
old
fellows
were
there
with
lean
hollow
cheeks
and
scanty
locks
but
the
most
were
warriors
in
their
prime
i
could
see
it
was
a
big
war
they
were
out
for
since
some
of
the
horses
carried
heavy
loads
of
corn
and
it
is
never
the
indian
fashion
to
take
much
provender
for
a
common
raid
in
all
virginia
history
there
had
been
no
such
invasion
for
the
wars
of
opechancanough
and
berkeley
and
the
fight
of
bacon
against
the
susquehannocks
were
mere
bickers
compared
with
this
deliberate
downpour
from
the
hills
as
we
lay
there
scarce
daring
to
breathe
i
saw
that
we
were
in
deadly
peril
the
host
was
so
great
that
some
marched
on
the
very
edge
of
our
thicket
i
could
see
through
the
leaves
the
brown
skins
not
a
yard
away
the
slightest
noise
would
bring
the
sharp
indian
eyes
peering
into
the
gloom
and
we
must
be
betrayed
in
that
moment
which
was
one
of
the
gravest
of
my
life
i
had
happily
no
leisure
to
think
of
myself
my
whole
soul
sickened
with
anxiety
for
the
girl
i
knew
enough
of
indian
ways
to
guess
her
fate
for
shalah
and
myself
there
might
be
torture
and
at
the
best
an
arrow
in
our
hearts
but
for
her
there
would
be
things
unspeakable
i
remembered
the
little
meadow
on
the
rapidan
and
the
tale
told
by
the
grey
ashes
there
was
only
one
shot
in
my
pistol
but
i
determined
that
it
should
be
saved
for
her
in
such
a
crisis
the
memory
works
wildly
and
i
remember
feeling
glad
that
i
had
stood
up
before
grey
fire
the
thought
gave
me
a
comforting
assurance
of
manhood
those
were
nightmare
minutes
the
girl
was
very
quiet
in
a
stupor
of
fatigue
and
fear
shalah
was
a
graven
image
and
i
was
too
tensely
strung
to
have
any
of
the
itches
and
fervours
which
used
to
vex
me
in
hunting
the
deer
when
stillness
was
needful
through
the
fretted
greenery
i
saw
the
dim
shadows
of
men
passing
swiftly
the
thought
of
the
horse
worried
me
if
the
confounded
beast
grazed
peaceably
down
the
other
side
of
the
hill
all
might
be
well
so
long
as
he
was
out
of
sight
any
movement
he
made
would
be
set
down
by
the
indians
to
some
forest
beast
for
animals
noises
are
all
alike
in
a
wood
but
if
he
returned
to
us
there
would
be
the
devil
to
pay
for
at
a
glimpse
of
him
our
thicket
would
be
alive
with
the
enemy
in
the
end
i
found
it
best
to
shut
my
eyes
and
commend
our
case
to
our
maker
then
i
counted
very
slowly
to
myself
up
to
four
hundred
and
looked
again
the
vale
was
empty
we
lay
still
hardly
believing
in
our
deliverance
for
the
matter
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
shalah
making
a
sign
to
me
to
remain
turned
and
glided
up
lull
i
put
my
hand
behind
me
found
cheek
and
patted
it
she
stretched
out
a
hand
and
clutched
mine
feverishly
and
thus
we
remained
till
after
what
seemed
an
age
shalah
returned
he
was
on
his
feet
and
walking
freely
he
had
found
the
horse
too
and
had
it
by
the
bridle
the
danger
is
past
he
said
gravely
let
us
go
back
to
the
glade
and
rest
i
helped
elspeth
to
her
feet
and
on
my
arm
she
clambered
to
the
grassy
place
in
the
woods
i
searched
my
pockets
and
gave
her
the
remnants
of
the
bread
and
bacon
i
had
brought
from
the
rappahannock
post
better
still
i
remembered
that
i
had
in
my
breast
a
little
flask
of
and
a
mouthful
of
it
revived
her
greatly
she
put
her
hands
to
her
head
and
began
to
tidy
her
dishevelled
hair
which
is
a
sure
sign
in
a
woman
that
she
is
recovering
her
composure
what
brought
you
here
i
asked
gently
she
had
forgotten
that
i
was
in
her
black
books
and
that
in
her
letter
she
forbade
my
journey
indeed
she
looked
at
me
as
a
child
in
a
pickle
may
look
at
an
upbraiding
parent
i
was
lost
she
cried
i
did
not
mean
to
go
far
but
the
night
came
down
and
i
could
not
find
the
way
back
oh
it
has
been
a
hideous
nightmare
i
have
been
almost
mad
in
the
dark
woods
but
how
did
you
get
here
i
asked
still
hopelessly
puzzled
i
was
with
uncle
james
on
the
rappahannock
he
heard
something
that
made
him
anxious
and
he
was
going
back
to
the
tidewater
yesterday
but
a
message
came
for
him
suddenly
and
he
left
me
at
morrison
farm
and
said
he
would
be
back
by
the
evening
i
did
not
want
to
go
home
before
i
had
seen
the
mountains
where
my
estate
is
you
know
the
land
that
governor
francis
said
he
would
give
me
for
my
birthday
they
told
me
one
could
see
the
hills
from
near
at
hand
and
a
boy
that
i
asked
said
i
would
get
a
rare
view
if
i
went
to
the
rise
beyond
the
river
so
i
had
paladin
saddled
and
crossed
the
ford
meaning
to
be
back
long
ere
sunset
but
the
trees
were
so
thick
that
i
could
see
nothing
from
the
first
rise
and
i
tried
to
reach
a
green
hill
that
looked
near
then
it
began
to
grow
dark
and
i
lost
my
head
and
oh
i
do
know
where
i
wandered
i
thought
every
rustle
in
the
bushes
was
a
bear
or
a
panther
i
feared
the
indians
too
for
they
told
me
they
were
unsafe
in
this
country
all
night
long
i
tried
to
find
a
valley
running
east
but
the
moonlight
deceived
me
and
i
must
have
come
farther
away
every
hour
when
day
came
i
tied
paladin
to
a
tree
and
slept
a
little
and
then
i
rode
on
to
find
a
hill
which
would
show
me
the
lie
of
the
land
but
it
was
very
hot
and
i
was
very
weary
and
then
you
came
and
those
dreadful
wild
men
and
and
she
broke
down
and
wept
piteously
i
comforted
her
as
best
i
could
telling
her
that
her
troubles
were
over
now
and
that
i
should
look
after
her
you
might
have
met
with
us
in
the
woods
last
night
i
said
so
you
see
you
were
not
far
from
friends
but
the
truth
was
that
her
troubles
were
only
beginning
and
i
was
wretchedly
anxious
my
impulse
was
to
try
to
get
her
back
to
the
rappahannock
but
on
putting
this
to
shalah
he
shook
his
head
it
is
too
late
he
said
if
you
seek
certain
death
go
towards
the
rappahannock
she
must
come
with
us
to
the
mountains
the
only
safety
is
in
the
this
seemed
a
mad
saying
to
be
safe
from
indians
we
were
to
go
into
the
heart
of
indian
country
but
shalah
expounded
it
the
tribes
he
said
dwelt
only
in
the
lower
glens
of
the
range
and
never
ventured
to
the
summits
believing
them
to
be
holy
land
where
a
great
dwelt
the
cherokees
especially
shunned
the
peaks
if
we
could
find
a
way
clear
to
the
top
we
might
stay
there
in
some
security
till
we
learned
the
issue
of
the
war
and
could
get
word
to
our
friends
moreover
he
said
we
have
yet
to
penetrate
the
secret
of
the
hills
that
was
the
object
of
our
quest
brother
shalah
was
right
and
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
i
could
not
suffer
my
care
for
elspeth
to
prevent
a
work
whose
issue
might
mean
the
salvation
of
virginia
we
had
still
to
learn
the
truth
about
the
massing
of
indians
in
the
mountains
of
which
the
cherokee
raids
were
but
scouting
ventures
the
verse
of
grey
song
came
into
my
head
i
could
not
love
thee
dear
so
much
loved
i
not
honour
more
besides
and
this
was
the
best
reason
there
was
no
other
way
we
had
gone
too
far
to
turn
back
and
as
our
proverb
says
it
is
idle
to
swallow
the
cow
and
choke
on
the
tail
i
put
it
all
to
elspeth
she
looked
very
scared
but
my
uncle
will
go
mad
if
he
does
not
find
me
it
will
be
worse
for
him
if
he
is
never
to
find
you
again
shalah
says
it
would
be
as
easy
to
get
you
back
over
the
rappahannock
as
for
a
child
to
cross
a
winter
torrent
i
do
say
it
pleasant
either
way
but
there
a
good
hope
of
safety
in
the
hills
and
there
none
anywhere
else
she
sat
for
a
little
with
her
eyes
downcast
i
am
in
your
hands
she
said
at
last
oh
the
foolish
girl
i
have
been
i
will
be
a
drag
and
a
danger
to
you
all
then
i
took
her
hand
elspeth
i
said
it
me
will
be
the
proud
man
if
i
can
save
you
i
would
rather
be
the
salvation
of
you
than
the
king
of
the
tidewater
and
so
says
shalah
and
so
will
say
all
of
us
but
i
do
not
think
she
heard
me
she
had
checked
her
tears
but
her
wits
were
far
away
grieving
for
her
uncle
pain
and
envisaging
the
desperate
future
at
the
first
water
we
reached
she
bathed
her
face
and
eyes
and
using
the
pool
as
a
mirror
adjusted
her
hair
then
she
smiled
bravely
i
will
try
to
be
a
true
comrade
like
a
man
she
said
i
think
i
will
be
stronger
when
i
have
slept
a
little
all
that
afternoon
we
stole
from
covert
to
covert
it
was
hot
and
oppressive
in
the
dense
woods
where
the
breeze
could
not
penetrate
shalah
eagle
eyes
searched
every
open
space
before
we
crossed
but
we
saw
nothing
to
alarm
us
in
time
we
came
to
the
place
where
we
had
left
our
party
and
it
was
easy
enough
to
pick
up
their
road
they
had
travelled
slowly
keeping
to
the
thickest
trees
and
they
had
taken
no
pains
to
cover
their
tracks
for
they
had
argued
that
if
trouble
came
it
would
come
from
the
front
and
that
it
was
little
likely
that
any
indian
would
be
returning
thus
soon
and
could
take
up
their
back
trail
presently
we
came
to
a
place
where
the
bold
spurs
of
the
hills
overhung
us
and
the
gap
we
had
seen
opened
up
into
a
deep
valley
shalah
went
in
advance
and
suddenly
we
heard
a
word
pass
we
entered
a
cedar
glade
to
find
our
four
companions
unsaddling
the
horses
and
making
camp
the
sight
of
the
girl
held
them
staring
grey
grew
pale
and
then
flushed
scarlet
he
came
forward
and
asked
me
abruptly
what
it
meant
when
i
told
him
he
bit
his
lips
there
is
only
one
thing
to
be
done
he
said
we
must
take
miss
blair
back
to
the
tidewater
i
insist
sir
i
will
go
myself
we
can
not
involve
her
in
our
dangers
he
was
once
again
the
man
i
had
wrangled
with
his
eyes
blazed
and
he
spoke
in
a
high
tone
of
command
but
i
could
not
be
wroth
with
him
indeed
i
liked
him
for
his
peremptoriness
it
comforted
me
to
think
that
elspeth
had
so
warm
a
defender
i
nodded
to
shalah
tell
him
i
said
and
shalah
spoke
with
him
he
took
long
to
convince
but
at
the
end
he
said
no
more
and
went
to
speak
to
elspeth
i
could
see
that
she
lightened
his
troubled
mind
a
little
for
having
accepted
her
fate
she
was
resolute
to
make
the
best
of
it
i
even
heard
her
laugh
that
night
we
made
her
a
bower
of
green
branches
and
as
we
ate
our
supper
round
our
modest
fire
she
sat
like
a
queen
among
us
it
was
odd
to
see
the
way
in
which
her
presence
affected
each
of
us
with
her
grey
was
the
courtly
cavalier
ready
with
a
neat
phrase
and
a
line
from
the
poets
donaldson
and
shalah
were
unmoved
no
woman
could
make
any
difference
to
their
wilderness
silence
the
frenchman
bertrand
grew
almost
gay
she
spoke
to
him
in
his
own
tongue
and
he
told
her
all
about
the
little
family
he
had
left
and
his
days
in
france
but
in
ringan
was
the
oddest
change
her
presence
kept
him
and
when
she
spoke
to
him
he
was
embarrassed
into
stuttering
he
was
eager
to
serve
her
in
everything
but
he
could
not
look
her
in
the
face
or
answer
readily
when
she
spoke
this
man
so
debonair
and
masterful
among
his
fellows
was
put
all
out
of
countenance
by
a
wearied
girl
i
do
not
suppose
he
had
spoken
to
a
gentlewoman
for
ten
years
chapter
xix
clearwater
glen
next
morning
we
came
into
clearwater
glen
shalah
spoke
to
me
of
it
before
we
started
he
did
not
fear
the
cherokees
who
had
come
from
the
far
south
of
the
range
and
had
never
been
settled
in
these
parts
but
he
thought
that
there
might
be
others
from
the
back
of
the
hills
who
would
have
crossed
by
this
gap
and
might
be
lying
in
the
lower
parts
of
the
glen
it
behoved
us
therefore
to
go
very
warily
once
on
the
higher
ridges
he
thought
we
might
be
safe
for
a
time
an
invading
army
has
no
leisure
to
explore
the
rugged
summits
of
a
mountain
the
first
sight
of
the
place
gave
me
a
strong
emotion
of
dislike
a
little
river
brawled
in
a
deep
gorge
falling
in
pools
and
linns
like
one
of
my
native
burns
all
its
course
was
thickly
shaded
with
bushes
and
knotted
trees
on
either
bank
lay
stretches
of
rough
hill
pasture
lined
with
dark
and
tangled
forests
which
ran
up
the
till
the
steepness
of
the
slope
broke
them
into
copses
of
stunted
pines
among
great
bluffs
of
rock
and
raw
red
scaurs
the
glen
was
very
narrow
and
the
mountains
seemed
to
beetle
above
it
so
as
to
shut
out
half
the
sunlight
the
air
was
growing
cooler
with
the
queer
acrid
smell
in
it
that
high
hills
bring
i
am
a
great
lover
of
uplands
and
the
sourest
has
a
charm
for
me
but
to
that
strange
glen
i
conceived
at
once
a
determined
hate
it
is
the
way
of
some
places
with
some
men
the
senses
perceive
a
hostility
for
which
the
mind
has
no
proof
and
in
my
experience
the
senses
are
right
part
of
my
discomfort
was
due
to
my
bodily
health
i
had
proudly
thought
myself
seasoned
by
those
hot
virginian
summers
in
which
i
had
escaped
all
common
ailments
but
i
had
forgotten
what
old
hunters
had
told
me
that
the
hills
will
bring
out
a
fever
which
is
dormant
in
the
plains
anyhow
i
now
found
that
my
head
was
dizzy
and
aching
and
my
limbs
had
a
strange
trembling
the
fatigue
of
the
past
day
had
dragged
me
to
the
limits
of
my
strength
and
made
me
an
easy
victim
my
heart
too
was
full
of
cares
the
sight
of
elspeth
reminded
me
how
heavy
was
my
charge
was
difficult
enough
to
scout
well
in
this
tangled
place
but
forbye
my
duty
to
the
dominion
i
had
the
business
of
taking
one
who
was
the
light
of
my
life
into
this
dark
land
of
bloody
secrets
the
youth
and
gaiety
were
going
out
of
my
quest
i
could
only
plod
along
dismally
attentive
to
every
movement
of
shalah
praying
incessantly
that
we
might
get
well
out
of
it
all
to
make
matters
worse
the
travelling
became
desperate
hard
in
the
tidewater
there
were
bridle
paths
and
in
the
vales
of
the
foothills
the
going
had
been
good
with
hard
dry
soil
in
the
woods
and
no
hindrances
save
a
thicket
of
vines
or
a
rare
windfall
but
in
this
glen
where
the
hill
rains
beat
there
was
no
end
to
obstacles
the
open
spaces
were
marshy
where
our
horses
sank
to
the
hocks
the
woods
were
one
medley
of
fallen
trees
rotting
into
touchwood
hidden
boulders
and
matted
briers
often
we
could
not
move
till
donaldson
and
bertrand
with
their
hatchets
had
hewn
some
sort
of
road
all
this
meant
slow
progress
and
by
midday
we
had
not
gone
up
the
glen
to
the
neck
which
meant
the
ridge
of
the
pass
this
was
an
occasion
when
ringan
showed
at
his
best
he
had
lost
his
awe
of
elspeth
and
devoted
himself
to
making
the
road
easy
for
her
grey
who
would
fain
have
done
the
same
was
no
match
for
the
seafarer
and
had
much
ado
to
keep
going
himself
ringan
cheery
face
was
better
than
medicine
his
eyes
never
lost
their
dancing
light
and
he
was
ready
ever
with
some
quip
or
whimsy
to
tide
over
the
worst
troubles
we
kept
very
still
but
now
and
again
elspeth
laugh
rang
out
at
his
fooling
and
it
did
my
heart
good
to
hear
it
after
midday
the
glen
seemed
to
grow
darker
and
i
saw
that
the
blue
sky
which
i
had
thought
changeless
was
becoming
overcast
as
i
looked
upwards
i
saw
the
high
ridge
blotted
out
and
a
white
mist
creeping
down
i
had
noticed
for
some
time
that
shalah
was
growing
uneasy
he
would
halt
us
often
while
he
went
a
little
way
on
and
now
he
turned
with
so
grim
a
look
that
we
stopped
without
bidding
he
slipped
into
the
undergrowth
while
we
waited
in
that
dark
lonesome
place
even
ringan
was
sober
now
elspeth
asked
in
a
low
voice
what
was
wrong
and
i
told
her
that
the
indian
was
uncertain
of
the
best
road
best
road
she
laughed
then
pray
show
me
what
you
call
the
worst
ringan
grinned
at
me
ruefully
where
do
you
wish
yourself
at
this
moment
andrew
on
the
top
of
this
damned
mountain
i
grunted
not
for
me
he
said
give
me
the
dry
tortugas
on
a
moonlight
night
when
the
breaming
fires
burn
along
the
shore
and
the
lads
are
singing
ladies
or
better
still
the
little
isle
of
john
the
baptist
with
the
fine
yellow
sands
for
careening
and
mother
daria
brewing
bobadillo
and
the
trades
blowing
fresh
in
the
tops
of
the
palms
this
land
is
a
gloomy
sort
of
business
give
me
the
bright
changeful
sea
and
i
said
elspeth
would
be
threading
rowan
berries
for
a
necklace
in
the
heather
of
medwyn
glen
it
must
be
about
four
of
a
midsummer
afternoon
and
a
cloudless
sky
except
for
white
streamers
over
tinto
ah
my
own
kind
countryside
ringan
face
changed
you
are
right
my
lady
no
tortugas
or
spanish
isles
for
ninian
campbell
give
him
the
steeps
of
glenorchy
on
an
october
morn
when
the
deer
have
begun
to
bell
my
sorrow
but
we
are
far
enough
from
our
desires
all
but
andrew
who
is
a
prosaic
soul
and
here
comes
shalah
with
ugly
news
the
indian
spoke
rapidly
to
me
the
woods
are
full
of
men
i
do
not
think
we
are
discovered
but
we
can
not
stay
here
our
one
hope
is
to
gain
the
cover
of
the
mist
there
is
an
open
space
beyond
this
thicket
and
we
must
ride
our
swiftest
quick
brother
the
men
i
gasped
cherokees
nay
he
said
not
cherokees
i
think
they
are
those
you
seek
from
beyond
the
mountains
the
next
is
a
mad
recollection
wild
and
confused
and
distraught
with
anxiety
the
thought
of
elspeth
among
savages
maddened
me
the
more
so
as
she
had
just
spoken
of
medwyn
glen
and
had
sent
my
memory
back
to
fragrant
hours
of
youth
we
scrambled
out
of
the
thicket
and
put
our
weary
beasts
to
a
gallop
happily
it
was
harder
ground
albeit
much
studded
with
clumps
of
fern
and
though
we
all
slipped
and
stumbled
often
the
horses
kept
their
feet
i
was
growing
so
dizzy
in
the
head
that
i
feared
every
moment
i
would
fall
off
the
mist
had
now
come
low
down
the
hill
and
lay
before
us
a
line
of
grey
vapour
drawn
from
edge
to
edge
of
the
vale
it
seemed
an
infinite
long
way
off
shalah
on
foot
kept
in
the
rear
and
i
gathered
from
him
that
the
danger
he
feared
was
behind
suddenly
as
i
stared
ahead
something
fell
ten
yards
in
advance
of
us
in
a
long
curve
and
stuck
quivering
in
the
soil
it
was
an
indian
arrow
we
would
have
reined
up
if
shalah
had
not
cried
on
us
to
keep
on
i
do
not
think
the
arrow
was
meant
to
strike
us
was
a
warning
a
grim
jest
of
the
savages
in
the
wood
then
another
fell
at
the
same
distance
before
our
first
rider
still
shalah
cried
us
on
i
fell
back
to
the
rear
for
if
we
were
to
escape
i
thought
there
might
be
need
of
fighting
there
i
felt
in
my
belt
for
my
loaded
pistols
we
were
now
in
a
coppice
again
where
the
trees
were
short
and
sparse
beyond
that
lay
another
meadow
and
then
not
a
distant
the
welcome
line
of
the
mist
every
second
drawing
down
on
us
a
third
time
an
arrow
fell
its
flight
was
shorter
and
dropped
almost
under
the
nose
of
elspeth
horse
which
swerved
violently
and
would
have
unseated
a
less
skilled
horsewoman
on
on
i
cried
for
we
were
past
the
need
for
silence
and
when
i
looked
again
the
kindly
fog
had
swallowed
up
the
van
of
the
party
i
turned
and
gazed
back
and
there
i
saw
a
strange
sight
a
dozen
men
or
more
had
come
to
the
edge
of
the
trees
on
the
they
were
quite
near
not
two
hundred
yards
distant
and
i
saw
them
clearly
they
carried
bows
or
muskets
but
none
offered
to
use
them
they
were
tall
fellows
but
lighter
in
the
colour
than
any
indians
i
had
seen
indeed
they
were
as
fair
as
many
an
englishman
and
their
slim
bodies
were
not
painted
in
the
maniac
fashion
of
the
cherokees
they
stood
stock
still
watching
us
with
a
dreadful
impassivity
which
was
more
frightening
to
me
than
violence
then
i
too
was
overtaken
by
the
grey
screen
will
they
follow
i
asked
shalah
i
do
not
think
so
they
are
not
and
fear
the
high
places
where
the
gods
smoke
there
is
no
need
we
have
escaped
then
i
asked
with
a
great
relief
in
my
voice
say
rather
we
have
been
shepherded
by
them
into
a
fold
they
will
find
us
when
they
desire
us
it
was
a
perturbing
thought
but
at
any
rate
we
were
safe
for
the
moment
and
i
resolved
to
say
nothing
to
alarm
the
others
we
overtook
them
presently
and
shalah
became
our
guide
not
that
more
guiding
was
needed
than
ringan
or
i
could
have
given
for
the
lift
of
the
ground
gave
us
our
direction
and
there
was
the
sound
of
a
falling
stream
to
an
man
mist
is
little
of
a
hindrance
unless
on
a
featureless
moor
ever
as
we
jogged
upward
the
air
grew
colder
rain
was
blowing
in
our
teeth
and
the
ferny
grass
and
juniper
clumps
dripped
with
wet
almost
it
might
have
been
the
pentlands
or
the
high
mosses
between
douglas
water
and
clyde
to
us
coming
fresh
from
the
torrid
plains
it
was
bitter
weather
and
i
feared
for
elspeth
who
was
thinly
clad
for
the
ringan
seemed
to
feel
the
cold
the
worst
of
us
for
he
had
spent
his
days
in
the
hot
seas
of
the
south
he
put
his
over
his
shoulders
and
cut
a
comical
figure
with
his
red
face
peeping
from
its
folds
lord
he
would
cry
i
wish
i
was
in
the
dry
tortugas
or
snug
in
the
at
the
isle
o
pines
this
minds
me
painfully
of
my
young
days
when
i
ran
in
a
ragged
kilt
in
the
cold
heather
of
cruachan
i
must
be
getting
an
old
man
andrew
for
i
never
thought
the
hills
could
freeze
my
blood
suddenly
the
fog
lightened
a
little
the
slope
ceased
and
we
had
that
gust
of
freer
air
which
means
the
top
of
the
pass
my
head
was
less
dizzy
now
and
i
had
a
momentary
gladness
that
at
any
rate
we
had
done
part
of
what
we
set
out
to
do
clearwater
gap
i
cried
except
for
old
studd
we
are
the
first
christians
to
stand
on
this
watershed
below
us
lay
a
swimming
hollow
of
white
mist
hiding
i
knew
not
what
strange
country
from
the
vales
below
i
had
marked
the
lie
of
the
land
on
each
side
of
the
gap
the
highest
ground
was
to
the
right
so
we
turned
up
the
ridge
which
was
easier
than
the
glen
and
better
travelling
presently
we
were
among
pines
again
and
got
a
shelter
from
the
driving
rain
my
plan
was
to
find
some
hollow
far
up
the
mountain
side
and
there
to
make
our
encampment
after
an
hour
riding
we
came
to
the
very
place
i
had
sought
a
pocket
of
flat
land
lay
between
two
rocky
knolls
with
a
ring
of
trees
around
it
the
spot
was
dry
and
hidden
and
what
especially
took
my
fancy
was
a
spring
of
water
which
welled
up
in
the
centre
and
from
which
a
tiny
stream
ran
down
the
hill
was
a
fine
site
for
a
stockade
and
so
thought
shalah
and
the
two
borderers
there
was
much
to
do
to
get
the
place
ready
and
donaldson
and
bertrand
fell
to
with
their
axes
to
fell
trees
for
the
fort
now
that
we
had
reached
the
first
stage
in
our
venture
my
mind
was
unreasonably
comforted
with
the
buoyancy
of
youth
i
argued
that
since
we
had
got
so
far
we
must
get
farther
also
the
fever
seemed
to
be
leaving
my
bones
and
my
head
clearing
elspeth
was
almost
merry
like
a
child
playing
at
making
house
she
ordered
the
men
about
on
divers
errands
she
was
a
fine
sight
with
the
wind
ruffling
her
hair
and
her
cheeks
reddened
from
the
rain
ringan
came
up
to
me
there
are
three
hours
of
daylight
in
front
of
us
what
say
you
to
make
for
the
top
of
the
hills
and
find
cairn
i
need
some
effort
to
keep
my
blood
running
i
would
gladly
have
stayed
behind
for
the
fever
had
tired
me
but
i
could
not
be
dared
by
ringan
and
not
respond
so
we
set
off
at
a
great
pace
up
the
ridge
which
soon
grew
very
steep
and
forced
us
to
a
crawl
there
were
places
where
we
had
to
scramble
up
loose
cliffs
amid
a
tangle
of
vines
and
then
we
would
dip
into
a
little
glade
and
then
once
again
breast
a
precipice
by
and
by
the
trees
dropped
away
and
there
was
nothing
but
low
bushes
and
boulders
and
rank
mountain
grasses
in
clear
air
we
must
have
had
a
wonderful
prospect
but
the
mist
hung
close
around
us
the
drizzle
blurred
our
eyes
and
the
most
we
saw
was
a
yard
or
two
of
grey
vapour
it
was
easy
enough
to
find
the
road
for
the
ridge
ran
upwards
as
narrow
as
a
hog
back
presently
it
ceased
and
with
labouring
breath
we
walked
a
step
or
two
in
flat
ground
ringan
who
was
in
front
stumbled
over
a
little
heap
of
stones
about
a
foot
high
studd
had
a
poor
notion
of
a
cairn
he
said
as
he
kicked
them
down
there
was
nothing
beneath
but
bare
soil
but
the
hunter
had
spoken
the
truth
a
little
digging
in
the
earth
revealed
the
green
metal
of
an
old
with
a
wooden
stopper
i
forced
it
open
and
shook
from
its
inside
a
twist
of
very
dirty
paper
there
were
some
rude
scratchings
on
it
with
charcoal
which
i
read
with
difficulty
to
studd
on
ye
sumit
of
mountaine
ye
of
june
sene
somehow
in
that
bleak
place
this
scrap
of
a
human
message
wonderfully
uplifted
our
hearts
before
we
had
thought
only
of
our
danger
and
cares
but
now
we
had
a
vision
of
the
reward
down
in
the
mists
lay
a
new
world
studd
had
seen
it
and
we
should
see
it
and
some
day
the
virginian
people
would
drive
a
road
through
clearwater
gap
and
enter
into
possession
it
is
a
subtle
joy
that
which
fills
the
heart
of
the
pioneer
and
mighty
unselfish
too
he
does
not
think
of
payment
for
the
finding
is
payment
enough
he
does
not
even
seek
praise
for
it
is
the
unborn
generations
that
will
call
him
blessed
he
is
content
like
moses
to
leave
his
bones
in
the
wilderness
if
his
people
may
pass
over
jordan
ringan
turned
his
flask
in
his
hands
a
good
man
this
old
studd
he
said
i
like
his
words
to
he
was
thinking
of
the
folk
that
should
come
after
him
which
is
the
mark
of
a
big
mind
andrew
your
common
fellow
would
have
writ
some
glorification
of
his
own
doings
but
studd
was
thinking
of
the
thing
he
had
done
and
not
of
himself
you
say
he
dead
these
ten
years
maybe
he
looking
down
at
us
and
nodding
his
old
head
well
pleased
i
would
like
fine
to
drink
his
health
we
ran
down
the
hill
and
came
to
the
encampment
at
the
darkening
ringan
who
had
retained
the
flask
presented
it
to
elspeth
with
a
bow
there
mistress
he
says
there
the
key
of
your
new
estate
chapter
xx
the
stockade
among
the
pines
it
took
us
a
heavy
day
work
to
get
the
stockade
finished
there
were
only
the
two
axes
in
the
party
besides
shalah
tomahawk
and
no
one
can
know
the
labour
of
felling
and
trimming
trees
tin
he
has
tried
it
we
found
the
horses
useful
for
dragging
trunks
and
but
for
them
should
have
made
a
poor
job
of
it
grey
white
hands
were
all
cut
and
blistered
and
though
i
boasted
of
my
hardiness
mine
were
little
better
ringan
was
the
surprise
for
you
would
not
think
that
sailing
a
ship
was
a
good
apprenticeship
to
forestry
but
he
was
as
skilful
as
bertrand
and
as
strong
as
donaldson
and
he
had
a
better
idea
of
fortification
than
us
all
put
together
the
palisade
which
ran
round
the
camp
was
six
feet
high
made
of
logs
lashed
to
upright
stakes
there
was
a
gate
which
could
be
barred
heavily
and
loopholes
were
made
every
yard
or
so
for
musket
fire
on
one
side
that
facing
the
uplift
of
the
ridge
the
walls
rose
to
nine
feet
inside
we
made
a
division
in
one
half
the
horses
were
picketed
at
night
and
the
other
was
our
dwelling
for
elspeth
we
made
a
bower
in
one
corner
which
we
thatched
with
pine
branches
but
the
rest
of
us
slept
in
the
open
round
the
fire
it
was
a
rough
place
but
a
strong
one
for
our
water
could
not
be
cut
off
and
as
we
had
plenty
of
ball
and
powder
a
few
men
could
hold
it
against
a
host
to
each
was
allotted
his
proper
station
in
case
of
attack
and
we
kept
watch
in
succession
like
soldiers
in
war
ringan
who
had
fought
in
many
places
up
and
down
the
world
was
our
general
in
these
matters
and
a
rigid
martinet
we
found
him
shalah
was
our
scout
and
we
leaned
on
him
for
all
woodland
work
but
inside
the
palisade
ringan
word
was
law
our
plan
was
to
make
this
stockade
the
centre
for
exploring
the
hills
and
ascertaining
the
strength
and
purposes
of
the
indian
army
we
hoped
and
so
did
shalah
that
our
enemies
would
have
no
leisure
to
follow
us
to
the
high
ridges
that
what
risk
there
was
would
be
run
by
the
men
on
their
spying
journeys
but
that
the
stockade
would
be
reasonably
safe
it
was
my
intention
as
soon
as
i
had
sufficient
news
to
send
word
to
lawrence
and
we
thought
that
presently
the
rappahannock
forces
would
have
driven
the
cherokees
southward
and
the
way
would
be
open
to
get
elspeth
back
to
the
tidewater
the
worst
trouble
as
i
soon
saw
was
to
be
the
matter
of
food
the
supplies
we
had
carried
were
all
but
finished
by
what
we
ate
after
the
stockade
was
completed
after
that
there
remained
only
a
single
bag
of
flour
another
bag
of
indian
meal
and
a
pound
or
two
of
boucanned
beef
besides
three
flasks
of
which
ringan
had
brought
in
a
leather
casket
the
forest
berries
were
not
yet
ripe
and
the
only
food
to
be
procured
was
the
flesh
of
the
wild
game
happily
in
donaldson
and
bertrand
we
had
two
practised
trappers
but
they
were
doubtful
about
success
for
they
had
no
knowledge
of
what
beasts
lived
in
the
hills
i
have
said
that
we
had
plenty
of
powder
and
ball
but
i
did
not
relish
the
idea
of
shooting
in
the
woods
for
the
noise
would
be
a
signal
to
our
foes
still
food
we
must
have
and
i
thought
i
might
find
a
secluded
place
where
the
echoes
of
a
shot
would
be
muffled
the
next
morning
i
parcelled
up
the
company
according
to
their
duties
for
while
ringan
was
captain
of
the
stockade
i
was
the
leader
of
the
venture
i
sent
out
bertrand
and
donaldson
to
trap
in
the
woods
ringan
with
grey
and
shalah
stayed
at
home
to
strengthen
still
further
the
stockade
and
protect
elspeth
while
i
took
my
musket
and
some
and
went
up
the
to
look
for
game
we
were
trysted
to
be
back
an
hour
before
sundown
and
if
some
one
of
us
did
not
find
food
we
should
go
supperless
that
day
is
a
memory
which
will
never
pass
from
me
the
weather
was
grey
and
lowering
and
though
the
rain
had
ceased
the
air
was
still
heavy
with
it
and
every
bush
and
branch
dripped
with
moisture
it
was
a
poor
day
for
hunting
for
the
eye
could
not
see
forty
yards
but
it
suited
my
purpose
since
the
dull
air
would
deaden
the
noise
of
my
musket
i
was
hunting
alone
in
a
strange
land
among
imminent
perils
and
my
aim
was
not
to
glorify
my
skill
but
to
find
the
means
of
life
the
thought
strung
me
up
to
a
mood
where
delight
was
more
notable
than
care
i
was
adventuring
with
only
my
hand
to
guard
me
in
those
ancient
haunted
woods
where
no
white
man
had
ever
before
travelled
to
experience
such
moments
is
to
live
with
the
high
fervour
which
god
gave
to
mortals
before
towns
and
laws
laid
their
dreary
spell
upon
them
early
in
the
day
i
met
a
bear
the
second
i
had
seen
in
my
life
i
did
not
want
him
and
he
disregarded
me
and
shuffled
grumpily
down
the
i
had
to
be
very
careful
i
remember
to
mark
my
path
so
that
i
could
retrace
it
and
i
followed
the
border
device
of
making
a
chip
here
and
there
in
the
bark
of
trees
and
often
looking
backward
to
remember
the
look
of
the
place
when
seen
from
the
contrary
side
trails
were
easy
to
find
on
the
soft
ground
but
besides
the
bear
i
saw
none
but
those
of
squirrel
and
rabbit
and
a
rare
opossum
but
at
last
in
a
marshy
glen
i
found
the
fresh
slot
of
a
great
stag
for
two
hours
and
more
i
followed
him
far
north
along
the
ridge
till
i
came
up
with
him
in
a
patch
of
scrub
oak
i
had
to
wait
long
for
a
shot
but
when
at
last
he
rose
i
planted
a
bullet
fairly
behind
his
shoulder
and
he
dropped
within
ten
paces
his
size
amazed
me
for
he
was
as
big
as
a
in
body
and
carried
a
spread
of
branching
antlers
like
a
forest
tree
to
me
accustomed
to
the
little
deer
of
the
tidewater
this
great
creature
seemed
a
portent
and
i
guessed
that
he
was
that
elk
which
i
had
heard
of
from
the
border
hunters
anyhow
he
gave
me
wealth
of
food
i
hid
some
in
a
cool
place
and
took
the
rest
with
me
packed
in
bark
in
a
great
bundle
on
my
shoulders
the
road
back
was
easier
than
i
had
feared
for
i
had
the
slope
of
the
hill
to
guide
me
but
i
was
mortally
weary
of
my
load
before
i
plumped
it
down
inside
the
stockade
presently
bertrand
and
donaldson
returned
they
brought
only
a
few
rabbits
but
they
had
set
many
traps
and
in
a
hill
burn
they
had
caught
some
fine
trout
soon
venison
steaks
and
fish
were
grilling
in
the
embers
and
elspeth
set
to
baking
cakes
on
a
griddle
those
left
behind
had
worked
well
and
the
palisade
was
as
perfect
as
could
be
contrived
a
runlet
of
water
had
been
led
through
a
hollow
trunk
into
a
trough
also
hewn
from
a
log
close
by
elspeth
bower
where
she
could
make
her
toilet
unperplexed
by
other
eyes
also
they
had
led
a
stream
into
the
horses
enclosure
so
that
they
could
be
watered
with
ease
the
weather
cleared
in
the
evening
as
it
often
does
in
a
hill
country
from
the
stockade
we
had
no
prospect
save
the
reddening
western
sky
but
i
liked
to
think
that
in
a
little
walk
i
could
see
old
promised
land
that
was
a
joy
i
reserved
for
myself
on
the
morrow
i
look
back
on
that
late
afternoon
with
delight
as
a
curious
interlude
of
peace
we
had
forgotten
that
we
were
fugitives
in
a
treacherous
land
i
for
one
had
forgotten
the
grim
purpose
of
our
quest
and
we
cooked
supper
as
if
we
were
a
band
of
careless
folk
taking
our
pleasure
in
the
wilds
is
always
for
me
an
intoxication
like
strong
drink
it
seems
the
incense
of
nature
altar
calling
up
the
shades
of
the
old
forest
gods
smacking
of
rest
and
comfort
in
the
heart
of
solitude
and
what
odour
can
vie
for
hungry
folk
with
that
of
roasting
meat
in
the
clear
hush
of
twilight
the
sight
of
that
little
camp
is
still
in
my
memory
elspeth
flitted
about
busied
with
her
cookery
the
glow
of
the
sunset
lighting
up
her
dark
hair
bertrand
did
the
roasting
crouched
like
a
gnome
by
the
edge
of
the
fire
grey
fetched
and
carried
for
the
cooks
a
docile
and
cheerful
servant
with
nothing
in
his
look
to
recall
the
proud
gentleman
of
the
tidewater
donaldson
sat
on
a
log
contentedly
smoking
his
pipe
while
ringan
whistling
a
strathspey
attended
to
the
horses
only
shalah
stood
aloof
his
eyes
fixed
vacantly
on
the
western
sky
and
his
ear
intent
on
the
multitudinous
voices
of
the
twilit
woods
presently
food
was
ready
and
our
rude
meal
in
that
darkling
place
was
a
merry
one
elspeth
sat
enthroned
on
a
couch
of
pine
branches
i
can
see
her
yet
shielding
her
face
from
the
blaze
with
one
little
hand
and
dividing
her
cakes
with
the
other
then
we
lit
our
pipes
and
fell
to
the
long
tales
of
the
ringan
had
a
story
of
a
princess
of
spain
and
how
for
love
of
her
two
gentlemen
did
marvels
on
the
seas
the
chief
one
never
returned
to
claim
her
but
died
in
a
fight
off
cartagena
and
wrote
a
fine
ballad
about
his
mistress
which
ringan
said
was
still
sung
in
the
taverns
of
the
main
he
gave
a
verse
of
it
a
wild
sad
thing
with
tears
in
it
and
the
joy
of
battle
after
that
we
all
sang
all
but
me
who
have
no
voice
bertrand
had
a
lay
of
normandy
about
a
lady
who
walked
in
the
and
fell
in
love
with
a
wandering
minstrel
and
donaldson
sang
a
rough
ballad
of
virginia
in
which
a
man
weighs
the
worth
of
his
wife
against
a
tankard
of
grey
sang
an
english
song
about
the
maid
who
came
to
london
and
a
bit
of
the
chanty
of
the
devon
men
who
sacked
santa
fe
and
stole
the
almirante
daughter
as
for
elspeth
she
sang
to
a
soft
scots
tune
the
tale
of
the
lady
of
cassilis
who
followed
the
gipsy
piping
in
it
the
gipsy
tells
of
what
he
can
offer
the
lady
and
lo
it
was
our
own
case
and
ye
shall
wear
no
silken
gown
no
maid
shall
bind
your
hair
the
yellow
broom
shall
be
your
gem
your
braid
the
heather
rare
athwart
the
moor
adown
the
hill
across
the
world
away
the
path
is
long
for
happy
hearts
that
sing
to
greet
the
day
my
love
that
sing
to
greet
the
day
i
remember
too
the
last
verse
of
it
and
at
the
last
no
solemn
stole
shall
on
thy
breast
be
laid
no
mumbling
priest
shall
speed
thy
soul
no
charnel
vault
thee
shade
but
by
the
shadowed
hazel
copse
aneath
the
greenwood
tree
where
airs
are
soft
and
waters
sing
ever
sleep
by
me
my
love
ever
sleep
by
me
then
we
fell
to
talking
about
the
things
in
the
west
that
no
man
had
yet
discovered
and
shalah
to
whom
our
songs
were
nothing
now
lent
an
ear
the
first
virginians
said
grey
thought
that
over
the
hills
lay
the
western
ocean
and
the
road
to
cathay
i
do
not
know
but
i
am
confident
that
but
a
little
way
west
we
should
come
to
water
a
great
river
or
else
the
ocean
ringan
differed
he
held
that
the
land
of
america
was
very
wide
in
those
parts
as
wide
as
south
of
the
isthmus
where
no
man
had
yet
crossed
it
then
he
told
us
of
a
who
had
travelled
inland
in
mexico
for
five
weeks
and
come
to
a
land
where
gold
was
as
common
as
chuckiestones
and
a
great
people
dwelt
who
worshipped
a
god
who
lived
in
a
mountain
and
he
spoke
of
the
holy
city
of
manoa
which
sir
walter
raleigh
sought
and
which
many
had
seen
from
far
likewise
of
the
wonderful
kings
who
once
dwelt
in
peru
and
the
little
isle
in
the
pacific
where
all
the
birds
were
nightingales
and
the
tree
of
life
flourished
and
the
mountain
north
of
the
main
which
was
all
one
emerald
i
think
he
said
that
though
no
man
has
ever
had
the
fruition
of
these
marvels
they
are
likely
to
be
more
true
than
false
i
hold
that
god
has
kept
this
land
of
america
to
the
last
to
be
the
loadstone
of
adventurers
and
that
there
are
greater
wonders
to
be
seen
than
any
that
man
has
imagined
the
pity
is
that
i
have
spent
my
best
years
scratching
like
a
hen
at
its
doorstep
instead
of
entering
i
have
a
notion
some
day
to
travel
straight
west
to
the
sunset
i
think
i
should
find
death
but
i
might
see
some
queer
things
first
then
shalah
spoke
there
was
once
a
man
of
my
own
people
who
when
he
came
to
strength
journeyed
westward
with
a
wife
he
travelled
all
his
days
and
when
his
eyes
were
dim
with
age
he
saw
a
great
water
his
spirit
left
him
on
its
shore
but
on
his
road
he
had
begotten
a
son
and
that
son
journeyed
back
towards
the
rising
sun
and
came
after
many
years
to
his
people
again
i
have
spoken
with
him
of
what
he
had
seen
and
what
was
that
asked
ringan
with
eager
eyes
he
told
of
plains
so
great
that
it
is
a
lifetime
to
travel
over
them
and
of
deserts
where
the
eagle
flying
from
the
dawn
dies
of
drought
by
midday
and
of
mountains
so
high
that
birds
can
not
cross
them
but
are
changed
by
cold
into
stone
and
of
rivers
to
which
our
little
waters
are
as
reeds
to
a
forest
cedar
but
especially
he
spoke
of
the
fierce
warriors
that
ride
like
the
wind
on
horses
it
seems
brother
that
he
who
would
reach
that
land
must
reach
also
the
hereafter
that
the
place
for
me
ringan
cried
what
say
you
andrew
when
this
affair
is
over
shall
we
make
a
bid
for
these
marvels
i
can
cull
some
pretty
adventurers
from
the
free
companions
nay
i
am
for
moving
a
step
at
a
time
said
i
i
am
a
trader
and
want
one
venture
well
done
before
i
begin
on
another
i
shall
be
content
if
we
safely
cross
these
mountains
on
which
we
are
now
perched
ringan
shook
his
head
that
was
never
the
way
of
the
highlands
a
bone
on
the
hills
than
a
fat
sheep
in
the
meadows
says
the
gael
what
say
you
mistress
and
he
turned
to
elspeth
i
think
you
are
the
born
poet
said
she
smiling
and
that
garvald
is
the
sober
man
of
affairs
you
will
leap
for
the
top
of
the
wall
and
get
a
prospect
while
garvald
will
patiently
pull
it
down
oh
i
grant
that
andrew
has
the
wisdom
said
ringan
that
why
him
and
me
so
well
agreed
it
because
we
differ
much
and
so
fit
together
like
opposite
halves
of
an
apple
is
your
traveller
still
in
the
land
of
the
living
he
asked
shalah
but
the
indian
had
slipped
away
from
the
fireside
circle
and
i
saw
him
without
in
the
moonlight
standing
rigid
on
a
knoll
and
gazing
at
the
skies
next
day
dawned
cloudless
and
shalah
and
i
spent
it
in
a
long
journey
along
the
range
we
kept
to
the
highest
parts
and
at
every
we
scanned
the
glens
for
human
traces
by
this
time
i
had
found
my
hill
legs
and
could
keep
pace
even
with
the
swift
stride
the
ridge
of
mountains
you
must
know
was
not
a
single
backbone
but
broken
up
here
and
there
by
valleys
into
two
and
even
three
ranges
this
made
our
scouting
more
laborious
and
prevented
us
from
getting
the
full
value
out
of
our
high
station
mostly
we
kept
in
cover
and
never
showed
on
a
skyline
but
we
saw
nothing
to
prove
the
need
of
this
stealth
only
the
hawks
wheeled
and
the
wild
pigeons
crooned
the
squirrels
frisked
among
the
branches
and
now
and
then
a
great
deer
would
leap
from
its
couch
and
hasten
into
the
coverts
but
though
we
got
no
news
that
journey
brought
to
me
a
revelation
for
i
had
my
glimpse
of
studd
promised
land
it
came
to
me
early
in
the
day
as
we
halted
in
a
little
glade
gay
with
willowherb
and
goldenrod
which
hung
on
a
shelf
of
the
hills
looking
westwards
the
first
streamers
of
morn
had
gone
the
mists
had
dried
up
from
the
valleys
and
i
found
myself
looking
into
a
deep
cleft
and
across
at
a
steep
mountain
clearly
the
valley
was
split
by
this
mountain
into
two
forks
and
i
could
see
only
the
cool
depth
of
it
and
catch
a
gleam
of
broken
water
a
mile
or
two
below
but
looking
more
to
the
north
i
saw
where
the
vale
opened
and
then
i
had
a
vision
worthy
of
the
name
by
which
studd
had
baptized
it
an
immense
green
pasture
land
ran
out
to
the
dim
horizon
there
were
forests
scattered
athwart
it
and
single
great
trees
and
little
ridges
too
but
at
the
height
where
we
stood
it
seemed
to
the
eye
to
be
one
verdant
meadow
as
trim
and
shapely
as
the
lawn
of
a
garden
a
noble
river
the
child
of
many
hill
streams
twined
through
it
in
shining
links
i
could
see
dots
which
i
took
to
be
herds
of
wild
cattle
grazing
but
no
sign
of
any
human
dweller
what
is
it
i
asked
unthinkingly
the
shenandoah
shalah
said
and
i
never
stopped
to
ask
how
he
knew
the
name
he
was
gazing
at
the
sight
with
hungry
eyes
he
whose
gaze
was
for
usual
so
passionless
that
prospect
gave
me
a
happy
feeling
of
comfort
why
i
can
not
tell
except
that
the
place
looked
so
bright
and
habitable
here
was
no
sour
wilderness
but
a
land
made
by
god
for
cheerful
human
dwellings
some
day
there
would
be
orchards
and
gardens
among
those
meadows
and
miles
of
golden
corn
and
the
smoke
of
hearth
fires
some
day
i
would
enter
into
that
land
of
canaan
which
now
i
saw
from
pisgah
some
day
and
i
scarcely
dared
the
thought
my
children
would
call
it
home
chapter
xxi
a
hawk
screams
in
the
evening
those
two
days
in
the
stockade
were
like
a
rift
of
sun
in
a
stormy
day
and
the
next
morn
the
clouds
descended
the
face
of
nature
seemed
to
be
a
mirror
of
our
fortunes
for
when
i
woke
the
freshness
had
gone
out
of
the
air
and
in
the
overcast
sky
there
was
a
forewarning
of
storm
but
the
little
party
in
the
camp
remained
cheerful
enough
donaldson
and
bertrand
went
off
to
their
trapping
elspeth
was
braiding
her
hair
the
handsomest
nymph
that
ever
trod
these
woodlands
and
trying
in
vain
to
discover
from
the
discreet
ringan
where
he
came
from
and
what
was
his
calling
the
two
borderers
knew
well
who
he
was
grey
i
think
had
a
suspicion
but
it
never
entered
the
girl
head
that
this
debonair
gentleman
bore
the
best
known
name
in
all
the
americas
she
fancied
he
was
some
exiled
jacobite
and
was
ready
to
hear
a
pitiful
romance
this
at
another
time
she
would
have
readily
got
but
ringan
for
the
nonce
was
in
a
sober
mood
and
though
he
would
talk
of
breadalbane
was
chary
of
touching
on
more
recent
episodes
all
she
learned
was
that
he
was
a
great
traveller
and
had
tried
most
callings
that
merit
a
interest
the
day
before
shalah
and
i
had
explored
the
range
to
the
south
keeping
on
the
west
side
where
we
thought
the
enemy
were
likely
to
gather
this
day
we
looked
to
the
side
facing
the
tidewater
a
difficult
job
for
it
was
eaten
into
by
the
upper
glens
of
many
rivers
the
weather
grew
hot
and
oppressive
and
over
the
lowlands
of
virginia
there
brooded
a
sullen
thundercloud
it
oppressed
my
spirits
and
i
found
myself
less
able
to
keep
up
with
shalah
the
constant
sight
of
the
lowlands
filled
me
with
anxiety
for
what
might
be
happening
in
those
sullen
blue
flats
gone
was
the
glad
forgetfulness
of
yesterday
the
promised
land
might
smile
as
it
pleased
but
we
were
still
on
the
flanks
of
pisgah
with
the
midianites
all
about
us
my
recollection
of
that
day
is
one
of
heavy
fatigue
and
a
pressing
hopelessness
shalah
behaved
oddly
for
he
was
as
restive
as
a
frightened
stag
no
covert
was
unsuspected
by
him
and
if
i
ventured
to
raise
my
head
on
any
exposed
ground
a
long
brown
arm
pulled
me
down
he
would
make
no
answer
to
my
questions
except
a
grunt
all
this
gave
me
the
notion
that
the
hills
were
full
of
the
enemy
and
i
grew
as
restive
as
the
indian
the
crackle
of
a
branch
startled
me
and
the
movement
of
a
scared
beast
brought
my
heart
to
my
throat
then
from
a
high
place
he
saw
something
which
sent
us
both
crawling
into
the
thicket
we
made
a
circuit
of
several
miles
round
the
head
of
a
long
ravine
and
came
to
a
steep
bank
of
red
screes
up
this
we
wormed
our
way
as
flat
as
snakes
with
our
noses
in
the
dusty
earth
i
was
dripping
with
sweat
and
cursing
to
myself
this
new
madness
of
shalah
then
i
found
a
cooler
air
blowing
on
the
top
of
my
prostrate
skull
and
i
judged
that
we
were
approaching
the
scarp
of
a
ridge
shalah
hand
held
me
motionless
he
wriggled
on
a
little
farther
and
with
immense
slowness
raised
his
head
his
hand
now
beckoned
me
forward
and
in
a
few
seconds
i
was
beside
him
and
was
lifting
my
eyes
over
the
edge
of
the
scarp
below
us
lay
a
little
plain
wedged
in
between
two
mountains
and
breaking
off
on
one
side
into
a
steep
glen
it
was
just
such
a
shelf
as
i
had
seen
in
the
carolinas
only
a
hundred
times
greater
and
it
lay
some
five
hundred
feet
below
us
every
part
of
the
hollow
was
filled
with
men
thousands
there
must
have
been
around
their
fires
and
teepees
and
coming
or
going
from
the
valley
they
were
silent
like
all
savages
but
the
low
hum
rose
from
the
place
which
told
of
human
life
i
tried
to
keep
my
eyes
steady
though
my
heart
was
beating
like
a
fanner
the
men
were
of
the
same
light
colour
and
slimness
as
those
i
had
seen
on
the
edge
of
the
mist
in
clearwater
glen
indeed
they
were
not
unlike
shalah
except
that
he
was
bigger
than
the
most
of
them
i
was
not
learned
in
indian
ways
but
a
glance
told
me
that
these
folk
never
came
out
of
the
tidewater
and
were
no
cherokees
of
the
hills
or
tuscaroras
from
the
carolinas
they
were
a
new
race
from
the
west
or
the
north
the
new
race
which
had
so
long
been
perplexing
us
somewhere
among
them
was
the
brain
which
had
planned
for
the
tidewater
a
sudden
destruction
shalah
slipped
noiselessly
backward
and
i
followed
him
down
the
scree
slope
across
the
ravine
and
then
with
infinite
caution
through
the
sparse
woods
till
we
had
put
a
wide
shoulder
of
hill
between
us
and
the
enemy
after
that
we
started
running
such
a
pace
as
made
the
rush
back
to
the
rappahannock
seem
an
easy
saunter
shalah
would
avoid
for
no
reason
that
i
could
see
and
make
long
circuits
in
places
where
i
had
to
go
on
hands
and
feet
i
was
weary
before
we
set
out
and
soon
i
began
to
totter
like
a
drunken
man
the
indian
arm
pulled
me
up
countless
times
and
his
face
usually
so
calm
was
now
sharp
with
care
you
can
not
fail
here
brother
he
would
say
on
our
speed
hang
the
lives
of
all
that
put
me
on
my
mettle
for
it
was
safety
i
now
strove
for
and
the
thought
gave
life
to
my
leaden
limbs
every
minute
the
air
grew
heavier
and
the
sky
darker
so
that
when
about
five
in
the
afternoon
we
passed
the
gap
and
struggled
up
the
last
hill
to
the
stockade
it
seemed
as
if
night
had
already
fallen
elspeth
and
ringan
were
there
and
the
two
trappers
had
just
returned
i
could
do
nothing
but
pant
on
the
ground
but
shalah
cried
out
for
news
of
grey
he
heard
that
he
had
gone
into
the
woods
with
his
musket
two
hours
past
at
this
he
flung
up
his
hands
with
a
motion
of
despair
we
can
not
wait
he
said
to
ringan
close
the
gate
and
put
every
man
to
his
post
for
the
danger
is
at
hand
ringan
gave
his
orders
the
big
log
gate
was
barred
the
fire
trampled
out
and
we
waited
in
that
thunderous
darkness
a
long
draught
of
cold
water
had
revived
me
and
i
could
think
clearly
of
elspeth
her
bower
was
in
the
safest
part
of
the
stockade
but
she
would
not
stay
there
i
could
see
terror
in
her
eyes
but
she
gave
no
sign
of
it
she
made
ready
our
supper
of
cold
meat
as
if
she
had
no
other
thought
in
the
world
waiting
on
an
attack
is
a
hard
trial
for
mortal
nerves
i
am
not
ashamed
to
confess
that
in
those
minutes
my
courage
was
little
to
boast
of
i
envied
ringan
his
ease
and
bertrand
his
light
cheerfulness
and
donaldson
his
unshaken
gravity
and
especially
i
envied
shalah
his
godlike
calm
but
most
of
all
i
envied
elspeth
the
courage
which
could
know
desperate
fear
and
never
show
it
most
likely
i
did
myself
some
wrong
most
likely
my
own
face
was
firm
enough
but
if
it
were
was
a
poor
clue
to
the
brain
behind
it
i
fell
to
wondering
about
grey
still
travelling
in
the
woods
was
there
any
hope
for
him
was
there
hope
indeed
for
any
one
of
us
penned
in
a
wooden
palisade
fifty
miles
from
aid
a
handful
against
an
army
presently
in
the
lowering
silence
came
the
scream
of
a
hawk
an
uncommon
sound
half
croak
half
cry
which
only
hill
dwellers
know
but
is
an
eery
noise
in
the
wilderness
it
came
again
less
near
and
a
third
time
from
a
great
distance
i
thought
it
queer
for
a
hawk
does
not
scream
twice
in
the
same
hour
i
looked
at
shalah
who
stood
by
the
gate
every
sinew
in
his
body
taut
with
expectation
he
caught
my
eye
that
hawk
never
flew
on
wings
he
said
then
an
owl
hooted
and
from
near
at
hand
came
the
cough
of
a
deer
the
thicket
was
alive
with
life
which
mimicked
the
wild
things
of
the
woods
then
came
a
sound
which
drowned
all
others
from
the
inky
sky
descended
a
jagged
line
of
light
and
in
the
same
second
the
crash
of
the
thunder
broke
never
have
i
seen
such
a
storm
down
in
the
tidewater
we
had
thunderstorms
in
plenty
during
the
but
they
growled
and
passed
and
scarce
ruffled
the
even
blue
of
the
sky
but
here
it
looked
as
if
we
had
found
the
home
of
the
lightnings
where
all
the
thunderbolts
were
forged
it
blazed
around
us
like
a
steady
fire
by
a
miracle
the
palisade
was
not
struck
but
i
heard
a
rending
and
splintering
in
the
forest
where
tall
trees
had
met
their
doom
the
noise
deafened
me
and
confused
my
senses
out
of
the
loophole
i
could
see
the
glade
that
sloped
down
to
the
gap
and
it
was
as
bright
as
if
it
had
been
high
noonday
the
clumps
of
fern
and
grass
stood
out
yellow
and
staring
against
the
inky
background
of
the
trees
i
remember
i
noted
a
rabbit
run
confusedly
into
the
open
and
then
at
a
fresh
flare
of
lightning
scamper
back
something
was
crouching
and
shivering
at
my
side
i
found
it
was
elspeth
whose
courage
was
no
match
for
the
terrors
of
the
heavens
she
snuggled
against
me
for
companionship
and
hid
her
face
in
the
sleeve
of
my
coat
suddenly
came
a
cry
from
shalah
on
my
left
he
pointed
his
hand
to
the
glade
and
in
it
i
saw
a
man
running
a
new
burst
of
light
sprang
up
for
some
dry
tindery
creepers
had
caught
fire
and
were
blazing
to
heaven
it
lit
a
stumbling
figure
which
i
saw
was
grey
and
behind
him
was
a
lithe
indian
running
on
his
trail
open
the
gate
i
cried
and
i
got
my
musket
in
the
loophole
the
fugitive
was
all
but
spent
he
ran
bowed
almost
to
the
ground
with
a
wild
back
glance
ever
and
again
over
his
shoulder
his
pursuer
gained
on
him
with
great
strides
and
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
bare
knife
i
dared
not
shoot
for
grey
was
between
me
and
his
enemy
was
as
well
i
could
not
for
otherwise
grey
would
never
have
reached
us
alive
we
cried
to
him
to
swerve
and
the
sound
of
our
voices
brought
up
that
last
flicker
of
hope
which
waits
till
the
end
in
every
man
he
seemed
actually
to
gain
a
yard
and
now
he
was
near
enough
for
us
to
see
his
white
face
and
staring
eyes
then
he
stumbled
and
the
man
with
the
knife
was
almost
on
him
but
he
found
his
feet
again
and
swerved
like
a
hunted
hare
in
one
desperate
bound
this
gave
me
my
chance
my
musket
cracked
and
the
indian
pitched
quietly
to
the
ground
the
knife
flew
out
of
his
hand
and
almost
touched
grey
heel
with
the
sound
shalah
had
leaped
from
the
gate
picked
up
grey
like
a
child
and
in
a
second
had
him
inside
the
palisade
and
the
bars
down
he
was
none
too
soon
for
as
his
pursuer
fell
a
flight
of
arrows
broke
from
the
thicket
and
had
i
shot
earlier
grey
had
died
of
them
as
it
was
they
were
too
late
the
bowmen
rushed
into
the
glade
and
five
muskets
from
our
side
took
toll
of
them
my
last
vision
was
of
leaping
yellow
devils
capering
from
among
blazing
trees
then
without
warning
it
was
dark
again
and
from
the
skies
fell
a
deluge
of
rain
in
a
minute
the
burning
creepers
were
quenched
and
the
whole
world
was
one
pit
of
ink
with
the
roar
as
of
a
thousand
torrents
about
our
ears
as
the
vividness
of
the
lightning
so
was
the
weight
of
the
rain
ringan
cried
to
us
to
stand
to
our
places
for
now
was
the
likely
occasion
for
attack
but
no
human
being
could
have
fought
in
such
weather
indeed
we
could
not
hear
him
and
he
had
to
stagger
round
and
shout
his
command
into
each
several
ear
the
might
of
the
deluge
almost
pressed
me
to
the
earth
i
carried
elspeth
into
her
bower
but
the
roof
of
branches
was
speedily
beaten
down
and
it
was
no
better
than
a
peat
bog
that
overwhelming
storm
lasted
for
maybe
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
it
stopped
as
suddenly
as
it
came
inside
the
palisade
the
ground
swam
like
a
loch
and
from
the
came
the
rumour
of
a
thousand
swollen
streams
that
with
the
heavy
drip
of
laden
branches
made
sound
enough
but
after
the
thunder
and
the
downpour
it
seemed
silence
itself
presently
when
i
looked
up
i
saw
that
the
black
wrack
was
clearing
from
the
sky
and
through
a
gap
there
shone
a
watery
star
ringan
took
stock
of
our
defences
and
doled
out
to
each
a
portion
of
sodden
meat
grey
had
found
his
breath
by
this
time
and
had
got
a
spare
musket
for
his
own
had
been
left
in
the
woods
elspeth
had
had
her
wits
sorely
jangled
by
the
storm
and
in
the
revulsion
was
on
the
brink
of
tears
she
was
very
tender
towards
grey
condition
and
the
sight
gave
me
no
jealousy
for
in
that
tense
hour
all
things
were
forgotten
but
life
and
death
donaldson
at
ringan
bidding
saw
to
the
feeding
of
the
horses
as
if
he
were
in
his
own
stable
on
the
rappahannock
it
takes
all
sorts
of
men
to
make
a
world
but
i
thought
at
the
time
that
for
this
business
the
steel
nerves
of
the
borderer
were
worth
many
quicker
brains
and
more
alert
spirits
the
hours
marched
sombrely
towards
midnight
while
we
stayed
every
man
by
his
post
i
asked
shalah
if
the
enemy
had
gone
and
he
shook
his
head
he
had
the
sense
of
a
wild
animal
to
detect
danger
in
the
forest
when
the
eye
and
ear
gave
no
proof
he
stood
like
a
stag
sniffing
the
night
air
and
peering
with
his
deep
eyes
into
the
gloom
fortunately
though
the
moon
was
all
but
full
the
sky
was
so
overcast
that
only
the
faintest
yellow
glow
broke
into
the
darkness
of
the
it
must
have
been
an
hour
after
midnight
when
we
got
our
next
warning
of
the
enemy
suddenly
a
firebrand
leaped
from
farther
up
the
hill
and
flew
in
a
wide
curve
into
the
middle
of
the
stockade
it
fell
on
the
partition
between
the
horses
and
ourselves
and
hung
crackling
there
a
shower
of
arrows
followed
it
which
missed
us
for
we
were
close
to
the
edges
of
the
palisade
but
the
sputtering
torch
was
a
danger
for
presently
it
would
show
our
position
so
bertrand
very
gallantly
pulled
it
down
stamped
it
out
and
got
back
to
his
post
unscathed
yet
the
firebrand
had
done
its
work
for
it
had
showed
the
savages
where
the
horses
stood
picketed
another
followed
lighting
in
their
very
midst
and
setting
them
plunging
at
their
ropes
i
heard
ringan
curse
deeply
for
we
had
not
thought
of
this
stratagem
and
the
next
second
i
became
aware
that
there
was
some
one
among
the
horses
at
first
i
thought
that
the
palisade
had
been
stormed
and
then
i
heard
a
soft
voice
which
was
no
indian
heedless
of
orders
i
flung
myself
at
the
rough
gate
and
in
a
trice
was
beside
the
voice
elspeth
was
busy
among
the
startled
beasts
she
had
a
passion
for
horses
and
had
as
we
say
the
cool
hand
with
them
for
she
would
soothe
a
frightened
stallion
by
rubbing
his
nose
and
whispering
in
his
ear
by
the
time
i
got
to
her
she
had
stamped
out
the
torch
and
was
stroking
grey
mare
which
was
the
worst
scared
her
own
fear
had
gone
and
in
that
place
of
plunging
hooves
and
tossing
manes
she
was
as
calm
as
in
a
summer
garden
let
me
be
andrew
she
said
i
am
better
at
this
business
than
you
she
had
the
courage
of
a
lion
but
was
a
wild
courage
without
foresight
another
firebrand
came
circling
through
the
darkness
and
broke
on
the
head
of
donaldson
pony
i
caught
the
girl
and
swung
her
off
her
feet
into
safety
and
then
on
the
heels
of
the
torch
came
a
flight
of
arrows
fired
from
near
at
hand
by
the
mercy
of
god
she
was
unharmed
i
had
one
through
the
sleeve
of
my
coat
but
none
reached
her
one
took
a
horse
in
the
neck
and
the
poor
creature
screamed
pitifully
presently
there
was
a
wild
confusion
of
maddened
beasts
with
the
torch
burning
on
the
ground
and
lighting
the
whole
place
for
the
enemy
i
had
elspeth
in
my
arms
and
was
carrying
her
to
the
gate
when
over
the
palisade
i
saw
yellow
limbs
and
fierce
faces
they
saw
it
too
ringan
and
the
rest
and
it
did
not
need
his
cry
to
keep
our
posts
to
tell
us
the
right
course
the
inner
palisade
which
shut
off
the
horses
must
now
be
our
line
of
defence
and
the
poor
beasts
must
be
left
to
their
fate
but
elspeth
and
i
had
still
to
get
inside
it
her
ankle
had
caught
in
a
picket
rope
which
in
another
second
would
have
wrenched
it
cruelly
had
i
not
slashed
it
free
with
my
knife
this
sent
the
horse
belonging
to
it
in
wild
career
across
the
corral
and
i
think
was
that
interruption
which
saved
our
lives
it
held
back
the
savages
for
an
instant
of
time
and
prevented
them
blocking
our
escape
it
all
took
place
in
the
flutter
of
an
though
it
takes
long
in
the
telling
i
pushed
elspeth
through
the
door
and
with
all
my
strength
tore
at
the
bars
but
they
would
not
move
perhaps
the
rain
had
swollen
the
logs
and
they
had
jammed
too
tightly
to
let
the
bar
slide
in
the
groove
so
i
found
myself
in
that
gate
the
mad
horses
and
the
savages
before
me
and
my
friends
at
my
back
with
only
my
arm
to
hold
the
post
i
had
my
musket
and
my
two
pistols
three
shots
for
there
would
be
no
time
to
reload
a
yellow
shadow
slipped
below
a
horse
belly
and
there
came
the
cry
of
an
animal
agony
then
another
and
another
and
yet
more
but
no
one
came
near
me
in
the
gateway
i
could
not
see
anything
to
shoot
at
only
lithe
shades
and
mottled
shadows
for
the
torch
lay
on
the
wet
ground
and
was
sputtering
to
its
end
the
moaning
of
the
horses
maddened
me
and
i
sent
a
bullet
through
the
head
of
my
own
poor
beast
which
was
writhing
horribly
elspeth
horse
got
the
contents
of
my
second
pistol
and
then
it
seemed
that
the
raiders
had
gone
there
was
one
bit
of
the
far
palisade
which
was
outlined
for
me
dimly
against
a
gap
in
the
trees
i
saw
a
figure
on
it
and
whipped
my
musket
to
my
shoulder
something
flung
up
its
arms
and
toppled
back
among
the
dying
beasts
then
a
hand
donaldson
i
think
clutched
me
and
pulled
me
back
with
a
great
effort
the
bars
were
brought
down
and
i
found
myself
beside
elspeth
all
her
fortitude
had
gone
now
and
she
was
sobbing
like
a
child
gradually
the
moaning
of
the
horses
ceased
and
the
whole
world
seemed
cold
and
silent
as
a
stone
we
stood
our
watch
till
a
wan
sunrise
struggled
up
the
chapter
xxii
how
a
fool
must
go
his
own
road
it
was
a
sorry
party
that
looked
at
each
other
in
the
first
light
of
dawn
our
eyes
were
hollow
with
suspense
and
all
but
shalah
had
the
hunted
look
of
men
caught
in
a
trap
not
till
the
sun
had
got
above
the
did
we
venture
to
leave
our
posts
and
think
of
food
it
was
now
that
elspeth
spirit
showed
supreme
the
courage
of
that
pale
girl
put
us
all
to
the
blush
she
alone
carried
her
head
high
and
forced
an
air
of
cheerfulness
she
lit
the
fire
with
donaldson
help
and
broiled
some
deer
flesh
for
our
breakfast
and
whistled
gently
as
she
wrought
bringing
into
our
wild
business
a
breath
of
the
orderly
comfort
of
home
i
had
seen
her
in
silk
and
lace
a
queen
among
the
gallants
but
she
never
looked
so
fair
as
on
that
misty
morning
her
hair
straying
over
her
brow
her
plain
kirtle
soiled
and
sodden
but
her
eyes
bright
with
her
young
courage
during
the
last
hours
of
that
dark
vigil
my
mind
had
been
torn
with
cares
if
we
escaped
the
perils
of
the
night
i
asked
myself
what
then
here
were
the
seven
of
us
pinned
in
a
with
no
help
within
fifty
miles
and
one
of
the
seven
was
a
woman
i
judged
that
the
indian
force
was
large
and
there
was
always
the
mighty
army
waiting
farther
south
in
that
shelf
of
the
hills
if
they
sought
to
take
us
it
must
be
a
matter
of
a
day
or
two
at
the
most
till
they
succeeded
if
they
only
played
with
us
which
is
the
cruel
indian
way
we
might
resist
a
little
but
starvation
would
beat
us
down
where
were
we
to
get
food
with
the
forests
full
of
our
subtle
enemies
to
sit
still
would
mean
to
wait
upon
death
and
the
waiting
would
not
be
long
there
was
the
chance
to
be
sure
that
the
indians
would
be
drawn
off
in
the
advance
towards
the
east
but
here
came
in
a
worse
anxiety
i
had
come
to
get
news
to
warn
the
tidewater
that
news
i
had
got
the
mighty
gathering
which
shalah
eyes
and
mine
had
beheld
in
that
upland
glen
was
the
peril
we
had
foreseen
what
good
were
easy
victories
over
raiding
cherokees
when
this
deadly
host
waited
on
the
leash
i
had
no
doubt
that
the
cherokees
were
now
broken
stafford
county
would
be
full
of
nicholson
militia
and
lawrence
strong
hand
lay
on
the
line
of
the
borders
but
what
availed
it
while
virginia
was
flattering
herself
that
she
had
repelled
the
savages
and
the
rappahannock
men
were
notching
their
muskets
with
the
tale
of
the
dead
a
wave
was
gathering
to
sweep
down
the
pamunkey
or
the
james
and
break
on
the
walls
of
james
town
i
did
not
think
that
nicholson
forewarned
and
prepared
could
stem
the
torrent
and
if
it
caught
him
unawares
the
proud
tidewater
would
break
like
a
rotten
reed
i
had
been
sent
to
scout
was
i
to
be
false
to
the
word
i
had
given
and
let
any
risk
to
myself
or
others
deter
me
from
taking
back
the
news
the
indian
army
tarried
why
i
did
not
know
perhaps
some
mad
whim
of
their
soothsayers
perhaps
the
device
of
a
wise
general
but
at
any
rate
they
tarried
if
a
war
party
could
spend
a
night
in
baiting
us
and
slaying
our
horses
there
could
be
no
very
instant
orders
for
the
road
if
this
were
so
a
bold
man
might
yet
reach
the
border
line
at
that
moment
it
seemed
to
me
a
madman
errand
even
if
i
slipped
past
the
watchers
in
the
woods
and
the
glens
the
land
between
would
be
strewn
with
fragments
of
the
cherokee
host
and
i
had
not
the
indian
craft
but
it
was
very
seriously
borne
in
upon
me
that
was
my
duty
to
try
god
might
prosper
a
bold
stroke
and
in
any
case
i
should
be
true
to
my
trust
but
what
of
elspeth
the
thought
of
leaving
her
was
pure
torment
in
our
hideous
peril
was
scarcely
to
be
endured
that
one
should
go
i
told
myself
that
if
i
reached
the
border
i
could
get
help
but
my
heart
warned
me
that
i
lied
my
news
would
leave
no
time
there
for
riding
hillward
to
rescue
a
rash
adventure
we
were
beyond
the
pale
and
must
face
the
consequences
that
we
all
had
known
and
reckoned
with
but
we
had
not
counted
that
our
risk
would
be
shared
by
a
woman
ah
i
that
luckless
ride
of
elspeth
but
for
that
foolish
whim
she
would
be
safe
now
in
the
cool
house
at
middle
plantation
with
a
ship
to
take
her
to
safety
if
the
worst
befell
and
now
of
all
the
king
subjects
in
that
hour
we
were
the
most
islanded
on
a
sand
heap
with
the
tide
of
savage
war
hourly
eating
into
our
crazy
shelter
before
the
daylight
came
as
i
stood
with
my
cheek
to
my
musket
i
had
come
to
a
resolution
in
a
tangle
of
duties
a
man
must
seize
the
solitary
clear
one
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
what
mine
was
i
must
try
for
the
tidewater
and
i
must
try
alone
shalah
had
the
best
chance
to
get
through
but
without
shalah
the
stockade
was
no
sort
of
refuge
ringan
was
wiser
and
stronger
than
i
but
i
thought
i
had
more
and
besides
the
duty
was
mine
not
his
grey
had
no
knowledge
of
the
wilds
and
donaldson
and
bertrand
could
not
handle
the
news
as
it
should
be
handled
in
the
unlikely
event
of
their
getting
through
alive
no
there
were
no
two
ways
of
it
i
must
make
the
effort
though
in
that
leaden
hour
of
weariness
and
cold
it
seemed
as
if
my
were
ringing
morn
showed
a
grey
world
strewn
with
the
havoc
of
the
storm
the
eagles
were
already
busy
among
the
dead
horses
and
our
first
job
was
to
bury
the
poor
beasts
just
outside
the
stockade
we
dug
as
best
we
could
a
shallow
trench
while
the
muskets
of
the
others
kept
watch
over
us
there
we
laid
also
the
body
of
the
man
i
had
shot
in
the
night
he
was
a
young
savage
naked
to
the
waist
and
curiously
tattooed
on
the
forehead
with
the
device
of
what
seemed
to
be
a
rising
or
setting
sun
i
observed
that
shalah
looked
closely
at
this
and
that
his
face
wore
an
unusual
excitement
he
said
something
in
his
own
tongue
and
when
the
trench
was
dug
laid
the
dead
man
in
it
so
that
his
head
pointed
westwards
we
wrought
in
a
dogged
silence
and
elspeth
cheery
whistling
was
the
only
sound
in
that
sullen
morning
it
fairly
broke
my
heart
she
was
whistling
the
old
tune
of
leezie
lindsay
a
merry
lilt
with
the
hill
wind
and
the
heather
in
it
the
bravery
of
the
poor
child
was
the
hardest
thing
of
all
to
bear
when
i
knew
that
in
a
few
hours
time
the
end
might
come
the
others
were
only
weary
and
dishevelled
and
ill
at
ease
but
on
me
seemed
to
have
fallen
the
burden
of
the
cares
of
the
whole
earth
shalah
had
disappeared
for
a
little
and
came
back
with
the
word
that
the
near
forests
were
empty
so
i
summoned
a
council
and
talked
as
we
breakfasted
i
had
looked
into
the
matter
of
the
food
and
found
that
we
had
sufficient
for
three
days
we
had
boucanned
a
quantity
of
flesh
two
days
before
and
this
with
the
fruit
of
trapping
made
a
fair
stock
in
our
larder
then
i
announced
my
plan
i
am
going
to
try
to
reach
lawrence
i
said
no
one
spoke
shalah
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
me
gravely
does
any
man
object
i
asked
sharply
for
my
temper
was
all
of
an
edge
your
throat
will
be
cut
in
the
first
mile
said
donaldson
gruffly
maybe
it
will
but
maybe
not
at
any
rate
i
can
try
you
have
not
heard
what
shalah
and
i
found
in
the
hills
yesterday
twelve
miles
south
there
is
a
glen
with
a
plateau
at
its
head
and
that
plateau
is
as
full
of
indians
as
a
beehive
ay
ringan
you
and
lawrence
were
right
the
cherokees
are
the
least
of
the
trouble
there
a
great
army
come
out
of
the
west
men
that
you
and
i
never
saw
the
like
of
before
and
they
are
waiting
till
the
cherokees
have
drawn
the
fire
of
the
borderers
and
then
they
will
bring
hell
to
the
tidewater
you
and
i
know
that
there
some
sort
of
madman
in
command
a
man
that
quotes
the
bible
and
speaks
english
but
madman
or
not
he
a
great
general
and
woe
betide
virginia
if
he
gets
among
the
manors
i
was
sent
to
the
hills
to
get
news
and
i
got
it
would
it
not
be
the
part
of
a
coward
to
bide
here
and
make
no
effort
to
warn
our
friends
what
good
would
a
warning
do
said
ringan
even
if
you
got
through
to
lawrence
which
is
not
very
likely
think
a
wheen
borderers
in
a
fort
will
stay
such
an
army
it
would
only
mean
that
you
lost
your
life
on
the
south
fork
instead
of
in
the
hills
and
there
little
comfort
in
that
it
not
like
you
to
give
such
counsel
i
said
sadly
a
man
can
not
think
whether
his
duty
will
succeed
as
long
as
it
there
for
him
to
do
it
maybe
my
news
would
make
all
the
differ
maybe
there
would
be
time
to
get
nicholson
militia
to
the
point
of
danger
god
has
queer
ways
of
working
if
we
trust
him
with
honest
hearts
besides
a
word
on
the
border
would
save
the
tidewater
folk
for
there
are
ships
on
the
james
and
the
york
to
flee
to
if
they
hear
in
time
let
virginia
go
down
and
be
delivered
over
to
painted
savages
and
some
day
soon
we
will
win
it
back
but
we
can
not
bring
life
to
the
dead
i
want
to
save
the
lowland
manors
from
what
befell
the
on
the
rapidan
and
if
i
can
only
do
that
much
i
will
be
content
will
you
counsel
me
ringan
to
neglect
my
plain
duty
i
gave
no
counsel
said
ringan
hurriedly
i
was
only
putting
the
common
sense
of
it
it
for
you
to
choose
here
grey
broke
in
i
protest
against
this
craziness
your
first
duty
is
to
your
comrades
and
to
this
lady
if
you
desert
us
we
lose
our
best
musket
and
you
have
as
little
chance
of
reaching
the
tidewater
as
the
moon
arc
you
so
madly
enamoured
of
death
mr
garvald
he
spoke
in
the
old
stiff
tones
of
the
man
i
had
quarrelled
with
i
turned
to
shalah
is
there
any
hope
of
getting
to
the
south
fork
he
looked
me
very
full
in
the
face
as
much
hope
as
a
dove
has
who
falls
into
an
eyrie
of
falcons
as
much
hope
as
the
deer
when
the
hunter
knife
is
at
its
throat
yet
the
dove
may
escape
and
the
deer
may
yet
tread
the
forest
while
a
man
draws
breath
there
is
hope
brother
which
i
take
to
mean
that
the
odds
are
a
thousand
against
one
said
grey
then
it
my
business
to
stake
all
on
the
one
i
cried
man
you
see
my
quandary
i
hold
a
solemn
trust
which
i
have
the
means
of
fulfilling
and
i
bound
to
try
it
torture
to
me
to
leave
you
but
you
will
lose
nothing
three
men
could
hold
this
place
as
well
as
six
if
the
indians
are
not
in
earnest
and
if
they
are
a
hundred
would
be
too
few
your
danger
will
be
starvation
and
i
will
be
a
mouth
less
to
feed
if
i
get
to
the
border
i
will
find
help
for
we
can
not
stay
here
for
ever
and
how
think
we
are
to
get
miss
blair
by
ourselves
to
the
rappahannock
with
every
mile
littered
with
fighting
clans
i
must
go
or
i
will
never
have
another
moment
peace
in
life
grey
was
not
convinced
send
the
indian
he
said
and
leave
the
stockade
defenceless
i
cried
it
because
he
stays
behind
that
i
dare
to
go
without
him
we
are
all
bairns
in
the
dark
that
true
anyway
said
ringan
and
fell
to
whittling
a
stick
for
three
days
i
continued
you
have
food
enough
and
if
by
the
end
of
it
you
are
not
attacked
you
may
safely
go
hunting
for
more
if
nothing
happens
in
a
week
time
you
will
know
that
i
have
failed
and
you
can
send
another
messenger
ringan
would
be
the
best
that
can
hardly
be
he
said
because
i
coming
with
you
now
i
could
only
stare
blankly
two
better
than
one
for
this
kind
of
business
and
i
am
no
use
here
only
consumere
as
i
learned
from
the
inveraray
dominie
it
my
concern
as
much
as
yours
for
i
brought
you
here
and
i
trysted
with
lawrence
to
take
back
word
i
loath
to
leave
my
friends
but
my
place
is
at
your
side
andrew
so
say
no
more
about
it
i
knew
it
was
idle
to
protest
ringan
was
as
obstinate
as
a
spanish
mule
when
he
chose
and
besides
there
was
reason
in
what
he
said
two
were
better
than
one
both
for
speed
in
travel
and
for
fighting
if
the
need
came
and
though
i
had
more
woodcraft
than
he
he
had
ten
times
my
wisdom
there
was
something
about
his
tone
which
took
the
enterprise
out
of
the
land
of
impossibilities
into
a
more
sober
realm
i
even
began
to
dream
of
success
but
when
i
looked
at
elspeth
her
eyes
were
so
full
of
grief
and
care
that
my
spirits
sank
again
tell
me
i
cried
that
you
think
i
am
doing
right
god
knows
it
is
hard
to
leave
you
and
i
carry
the
sorest
heart
in
virginia
but
you
would
not
have
me
stay
idle
when
my
plain
duty
commands
say
that
you
bid
me
go
elspeth
i
bid
you
go
she
said
bravely
and
i
will
pray
god
to
keep
you
safe
but
her
eyes
belied
her
voice
for
they
were
swimming
with
tears
at
that
moment
i
got
the
conviction
that
i
was
more
to
her
than
a
mere
companion
that
by
some
miracle
i
had
won
a
place
in
that
proud
and
loyal
heart
it
seemed
a
cruel
stroke
of
fate
that
i
should
get
this
hope
at
the
very
moment
when
i
was
to
leave
her
and
go
into
the
shadow
of
death
but
that
was
no
hour
to
think
of
love
i
took
every
man
apart
and
swore
him
though
there
was
little
need
to
stand
by
the
girl
at
all
costs
to
grey
i
opened
my
inmost
thoughts
you
and
i
serve
one
mistress
i
said
and
now
i
confide
her
to
your
care
all
that
i
would
have
done
i
am
assured
you
will
do
my
heart
is
easier
when
i
know
that
you
are
by
her
side
once
we
were
foes
and
since
then
we
have
been
friends
and
now
you
are
the
dearest
friend
on
earth
for
i
leave
you
with
all
i
cherish
he
flushed
deeply
and
gave
me
his
hand
go
in
peace
sir
he
said
if
god
wills
that
we
perish
my
last
act
will
be
to
assure
an
easy
passage
to
heaven
for
her
we
worship
if
we
meet
again
we
meet
as
honourable
rivals
and
may
that
day
come
soon
so
with
pistols
in
belt
and
a
supply
of
cartouches
and
some
little
food
in
our
pockets
ringan
and
i
were
enfolded
in
the
silence
of
the
woods
chapter
xxiii
the
horn
of
diarmaid
sounds
we
reached
the
gap
and
made
slantwise
across
the
farther
hill
i
did
not
dare
to
go
clown
clearwater
glen
and
besides
i
was
aiming
for
a
point
farther
south
than
the
rappahannock
in
my
wanderings
with
shalah
i
had
got
a
pretty
good
idea
of
the
lie
of
the
mountains
on
their
eastern
side
and
i
had
remarked
a
long
ridge
which
flung
itself
like
a
cape
far
into
the
lowlands
if
we
could
leave
the
hills
by
this
i
thought
we
might
strike
the
stream
called
the
north
fork
which
would
bring
us
in
time
to
the
neighbourhood
of
frew
dwelling
the
ridges
were
our
only
safe
path
for
they
were
thickly
overgrown
with
woods
and
the
indian
bands
were
less
likely
to
choose
them
for
a
route
the
danger
was
in
the
glens
where
the
trees
were
sparser
and
the
broad
stretches
of
meadow
made
better
going
for
horses
the
movement
of
my
legs
made
me
pluck
up
heart
i
was
embarked
at
any
rate
in
a
venture
and
had
got
rid
of
my
desperate
indecision
the
two
of
us
held
close
together
and
chose
the
duskiest
thickets
crawling
over
the
little
clear
patches
and
avoiding
the
crown
of
the
ridge
like
the
plague
the
weather
helped
us
for
the
skies
hung
grey
and
low
with
wisps
of
vapour
curling
among
the
trees
the
glens
were
pits
of
mist
and
my
only
guide
was
my
recollection
of
what
i
had
seen
and
the
easterly
course
of
the
streams
by
midday
we
had
mounted
to
the
crest
of
a
long
scarp
which
fell
away
in
a
narrow
and
broken
promontory
towards
the
plains
so
far
we
had
seen
nothing
to
give
us
pause
and
the
only
risk
lay
in
some
indian
finding
and
following
our
trail
we
lay
close
in
a
scrubby
wood
and
rested
for
a
little
while
we
ate
some
food
everything
around
us
dripped
with
moisture
and
i
could
have
wrung
pints
from
my
coat
and
breeches
oh
for
the
dry
tortugas
ringan
sighed
what
i
would
give
for
a
hot
sun
and
the
kindly
winds
o
the
sea
i
thought
i
pined
for
the
hills
andrew
but
i
would
not
give
a
clean
beach
and
a
warm
for
all
the
mountains
on
earth
then
again
yon
a
fine
lass
he
would
say
i
did
not
reply
for
i
had
no
heart
to
speak
of
what
i
had
left
behind
cheer
up
young
one
he
cried
there
was
more
lost
at
flodden
a
must
live
by
the
hour
and
it
surprising
how
fortune
favours
them
that
trust
her
there
was
a
man
i
mind
in
breadalbane
and
here
he
would
tell
some
tale
of
how
light
came
out
of
black
darkness
for
the
trusting
heart
man
ringan
i
said
i
see
your
kindly
purpose
but
tell
me
did
ever
you
hear
of
such
a
tangle
as
ours
being
straightened
out
why
yes
he
said
i
been
in
worse
myself
and
here
i
am
i
have
been
in
a
cell
at
cartagena
chained
to
a
man
that
had
died
of
the
plague
with
the
gallows
preparing
for
me
at
but
in
the
night
some
friends
o
mine
came
into
the
bay
and
i
had
the
solemn
joy
of
stepping
out
of
yon
cell
over
the
corp
of
the
almirante
i
been
mad
with
fever
and
jumped
into
the
palmas
river
among
the
alligators
and
not
one
of
them
touched
me
though
i
was
swimming
about
crying
that
the
water
was
burning
oil
and
then
a
lad
in
a
boat
gave
me
a
clout
on
the
head
that
knocked
the
daftness
out
of
me
and
in
a
week
i
was
marching
on
my
own
deck
with
my
bonnet
cocked
like
a
king
captain
i
been
set
by
my
unfriends
on
a
rock
in
the
florida
keys
with
a
keg
of
dirty
water
and
a
bunch
of
figs
and
the
sun
like
to
melt
my
brains
and
two
bullet
holes
in
my
thigh
but
i
came
out
of
the
pickle
and
lived
to
make
the
men
that
put
me
there
sorry
they
had
been
born
ay
and
i
seen
my
grave
dug
and
my
dead
clothes
ready
and
in
a
week
i
was
making
napkins
out
of
them
there
a
wonderful
kindness
in
providence
to
mettled
folk
ay
ringan
but
that
was
only
the
risk
of
your
own
neck
i
think
i
could
endure
that
but
was
there
ever
another
you
liked
far
better
than
yourself
that
you
had
to
see
in
deadly
peril
no
i
be
honest
with
you
there
never
was
i
grant
you
that
the
hardest
thing
to
thole
but
you
keep
a
stiff
lip
even
to
that
seeing
you
are
the
braver
of
the
two
of
us
at
that
i
cried
out
in
expostulation
but
ringan
was
firm
ay
the
braver
by
far
and
i
say
it
again
i
a
man
of
the
dancing
blood
with
a
rare
appetite
for
frays
and
forays
you
are
the
sedate
soul
that
would
be
happier
at
home
in
the
chimney
corner
and
yet
you
are
the
most
determined
of
the
lot
of
us
though
you
have
no
pleasure
in
it
why
just
because
you
are
the
bravest
you
can
force
yourself
to
a
job
when
flesh
and
spirit
cry
out
against
it
i
let
no
man
alive
cry
down
my
courage
but
i
say
freely
that
it
not
to
be
evened
with
yours
i
was
not
feeling
very
courageous
as
we
sped
along
the
ridge
in
the
afternoon
i
seemed
to
myself
like
a
midge
lost
in
a
monstrous
net
the
dank
dripping
trees
and
the
misty
hills
seemed
to
muffle
and
deaden
the
world
i
could
not
believe
that
they
ever
would
end
that
anywhere
there
was
a
clear
sky
and
open
country
and
i
had
always
the
feeling
that
in
those
banks
of
vapour
lurked
deadly
enemies
who
any
moment
might
steal
out
and
encompass
us
but
about
four
the
weather
lightened
and
from
the
on
which
we
moved
we
looked
down
into
the
lower
glens
i
saw
that
we
had
left
the
main
flanks
of
the
range
behind
us
and
were
now
fairly
on
a
cape
which
jutted
out
beyond
the
other
ridges
it
behoved
us
now
to
go
warily
and
where
the
thickets
grew
thin
we
moved
like
hunters
in
every
hollow
and
crack
that
could
shelter
a
man
ringan
led
and
led
well
for
he
had
not
stalked
the
red
deer
on
the
braes
of
breadalbane
for
nothing
but
no
sign
of
life
appeared
in
the
green
hollows
on
either
hand
neither
in
the
meadow
spaces
nor
by
the
creeks
of
the
growing
streams
the
world
was
dead
silent
not
even
a
bird
showed
in
the
whole
firmament
lower
and
lower
we
went
till
the
end
of
the
ridge
was
before
us
a
slope
which
melted
into
the
river
plains
a
single
shaft
of
bright
sunshine
broke
from
the
clouds
behind
us
and
showed
the
tumbled
country
of
low
downs
and
shallow
vales
which
stretched
to
the
tidewater
border
i
had
a
momentary
gleam
of
hope
as
sudden
and
transient
as
that
ray
of
light
we
were
almost
out
of
the
hills
and
that
accomplished
we
were
most
likely
free
of
the
indian
forces
that
gathered
there
i
had
come
to
share
the
rappahannock
men
opinion
about
the
cherokees
if
we
could
escape
the
strange
tribes
from
the
west
i
looked
for
no
trouble
at
the
hands
of
those
common
raiders
the
thicket
ended
with
the
ridge
and
there
was
a
of
broken
meadow
before
the
forest
began
it
was
a
queer
place
that
patch
of
green
grass
set
like
an
arena
for
an
audience
on
the
mountain
side
a
fine
stream
ran
through
it
coming
down
the
glen
on
our
right
and
falling
afterwards
into
a
dark
woody
ravine
i
mistrusted
the
look
of
it
for
there
was
no
cover
and
was
in
full
view
of
the
whole
flanks
of
the
hills
ringan
too
was
disturbed
twould
be
wiser
like
to
wait
for
darkness
before
trying
that
bit
he
said
we
be
terrible
kenspeckle
to
the
gentry
we
ken
of
but
i
would
not
hear
of
delay
now
that
we
were
all
but
out
of
the
hills
i
was
mad
to
get
forward
i
thought
foolishly
that
every
minute
we
delayed
there
we
increased
our
peril
and
i
longed
for
the
covering
of
the
lowland
forest
besides
i
thought
that
by
using
some
of
the
crinkles
in
the
meadow
we
could
be
sheltered
from
any
eyes
on
the
slopes
ringan
poked
his
head
out
of
the
covert
and
took
a
long
gaze
the
place
seems
empty
enough
but
i
can
not
like
it
have
you
your
pistols
handy
andrew
i
see
what
looks
like
an
indian
track
and
if
we
were
to
meet
a
brave
or
two
it
would
be
a
pity
to
let
them
betray
us
i
looked
at
my
pistols
to
see
if
the
damp
woods
had
spoiled
the
priming
well
here
for
fortune
said
ringan
and
we
scrambled
off
the
ridge
and
plunged
into
the
lush
grasses
of
the
meadow
had
we
kept
our
heads
and
crossed
as
prudently
as
we
had
made
the
morning
journey
all
might
have
been
well
but
a
madcap
haste
seemed
to
possess
us
we
tore
through
the
herbage
as
if
we
had
been
running
a
race
in
the
yard
of
a
peaceful
manor
the
stream
stayed
us
a
little
for
it
could
not
be
forded
without
a
wetting
and
i
went
in
up
to
the
waist
as
we
scrambled
up
the
far
bank
some
impulse
made
me
turn
my
head
there
coming
down
the
water
was
a
band
of
indians
they
were
still
some
distance
off
but
they
saw
us
and
put
their
horses
to
the
gallop
i
cried
to
ringan
to
run
for
the
shelter
of
the
woods
for
in
the
open
we
were
at
their
mercy
he
cast
one
glance
over
his
shoulder
and
set
a
pace
which
came
near
to
foundering
me
we
got
what
we
wanted
earlier
than
we
had
hoped
the
woods
in
front
rose
in
a
high
bluff
and
down
a
little
ravine
a
burn
trickled
the
sides
were
too
steep
and
matted
for
horses
to
travel
and
he
who
stood
in
the
ravine
had
his
back
and
flanks
defended
now
for
a
fight
andrew
lad
cried
ringan
his
eyes
dancing
stick
you
to
the
pistols
and
i
show
them
something
in
the
way
of
the
indians
wheeled
up
to
the
edge
of
the
ravine
and
i
saw
to
my
joy
that
they
did
not
carry
bows
one
had
a
musket
but
it
looked
as
if
he
had
no
powder
left
for
it
swung
idly
on
his
back
they
had
tomahawks
at
their
belts
and
long
shining
knives
with
deerhorn
handles
i
only
got
a
glimpse
of
them
but
enough
to
show
me
they
were
of
that
western
nation
that
i
dreaded
they
were
gone
in
an
instant
that
looks
bad
for
us
andrew
ringan
said
if
they
had
come
down
on
us
yelling
for
our
scalps
we
would
have
had
a
merry
meeting
but
they
either
gone
to
bring
their
friends
or
they
trying
to
take
us
in
the
back
i
guard
the
front
and
you
keep
your
eyes
on
the
hinder
parts
though
a
jackdaw
could
scarcely
win
over
these
craigs
a
sudden
burst
of
sun
came
out
while
ringan
and
i
waited
uneasily
the
great
blue
roll
of
mountain
we
had
left
was
lit
below
the
mist
with
a
glory
of
emerald
and
gold
ringan
was
whistling
softly
through
his
teeth
while
i
scanned
the
half
moon
of
rock
and
matted
vines
which
made
our
shelter
there
was
no
sound
in
the
air
but
the
tap
of
a
woodpecker
and
the
trickling
of
the
little
runlets
from
the
wet
sides
the
mind
in
a
close
watch
falls
under
a
spell
so
that
while
the
senses
are
alert
the
thoughts
are
apt
to
wander
as
i
have
said
before
i
have
the
sharpest
sight
and
as
i
watched
a
point
of
rock
it
seemed
to
move
ever
so
slightly
i
rubbed
my
eyes
and
thought
it
fancy
and
a
sudden
noise
above
made
me
turn
my
head
it
was
only
a
bird
and
as
i
looked
again
at
the
rock
it
seemed
as
if
a
spray
of
vine
had
blown
athwart
it
which
was
not
there
before
i
gazed
intently
and
following
the
spray
into
the
shadow
i
saw
something
liquid
and
mottled
like
a
toad
skin
as
i
stared
it
flickered
and
shimmered
was
only
the
light
on
a
wet
leaf
i
told
myself
but
surely
it
had
not
been
there
before
a
sudden
suspicion
seized
me
and
i
lifted
my
pistol
and
fired
there
was
a
shudder
in
the
thicket
and
an
indian
shot
through
the
head
rolled
into
the
burn
at
the
sound
i
heard
ringan
cry
out
and
there
came
a
great
from
the
mouth
of
the
ravine
i
gave
one
look
and
then
turned
to
my
own
business
for
as
the
dead
man
fell
another
leaped
from
the
matted
cliffs
my
second
pistol
missed
fire
in
crossing
the
stream
i
must
have
damped
the
priming
what
happened
next
is
all
confusion
in
my
mind
i
dodged
the
fall
of
the
knife
and
struck
hard
with
my
pistol
butt
at
the
uplifted
arm
i
felt
no
fear
only
intense
anger
at
my
folly
in
not
having
looked
better
to
my
priming
but
the
shock
of
the
man
charge
upset
me
and
the
next
i
knew
of
it
we
were
wrestling
on
the
ground
i
had
his
right
arm
by
the
wrist
but
i
was
no
match
for
him
in
suppleness
and
in
the
position
in
which
we
lay
i
could
not
use
the
weight
of
my
shoulders
the
most
i
could
do
was
to
keep
him
from
striking
and
to
effect
that
my
strength
was
stretched
to
its
uttermost
my
eyes
filmed
with
weariness
and
my
breath
came
in
gasps
for
remember
i
had
been
up
all
night
and
that
day
had
already
travelled
many
miles
i
remember
yet
the
sickly
smell
of
his
greasy
skin
and
the
red
hate
of
his
eyes
as
we
struggled
i
could
see
ringan
holding
the
mouth
of
the
ravine
with
his
sword
one
of
his
foes
he
had
shot
and
the
best
blade
in
the
five
seas
was
now
engaged
with
three
indian
knives
i
heard
his
happy
whistling
and
a
grunt
now
and
then
from
a
wounded
foe
he
had
enough
to
do
and
could
give
me
no
aid
and
as
i
realized
this
i
felt
the
grip
of
my
arms
growing
slacker
and
knew
that
in
a
second
or
two
i
should
feel
that
long
indian
steel
i
made
a
desperate
effort
and
swung
round
so
that
i
got
my
left
shoulder
on
his
knife
arm
that
brought
my
right
shoulder
close
to
his
mouth
and
he
bit
me
to
the
bone
the
wound
did
me
good
for
it
maddened
me
and
i
got
a
knee
loose
and
forced
it
into
his
loins
for
a
moment
i
dreamed
of
victory
but
i
had
not
counted
on
the
wiles
of
a
savage
he
lay
quite
limp
for
a
second
and
as
i
relaxed
my
effort
a
little
seized
the
occasion
to
slip
from
beneath
me
and
let
me
roll
into
the
burn
the
next
instant
he
was
above
me
and
i
saw
the
knife
against
the
sky
i
thought
that
all
was
over
he
pushed
back
his
hair
from
his
eyes
and
the
steel
quivered
and
then
something
thrust
between
me
and
the
point
there
was
a
leap
and
a
shudder
and
i
was
gazing
at
emptiness
i
lay
gazing
for
i
seemed
bereft
of
wits
then
a
voice
cried
are
you
hurt
andrew
and
i
got
to
my
feet
my
enemy
lay
in
the
pool
of
the
burn
with
a
hole
through
his
throat
from
ringan
sword
a
little
farther
off
lay
the
savage
i
had
shot
at
the
mouth
of
the
ravine
lay
three
dead
indians
the
last
of
the
six
must
have
fled
ringan
had
sheathed
his
blade
and
was
looking
at
me
with
a
queer
smile
on
his
face
yon
was
a
merry
bout
andrew
he
said
and
his
voice
sounded
very
far
away
then
he
swayed
into
my
arms
and
i
saw
that
his
vest
was
dark
with
blood
what
is
it
i
cried
in
wild
fear
are
you
hurt
ringan
i
laid
him
on
a
bed
of
moss
and
opened
his
shirt
in
his
breast
was
a
gaping
wound
from
which
the
bright
blood
was
welling
he
lay
with
his
eyes
closed
while
i
strove
to
stanch
the
flow
then
he
choked
and
as
i
raised
his
head
there
came
a
gush
of
blood
from
his
lips
that
man
of
yours
he
whispered
i
got
his
knife
before
he
got
my
sword
i
doubt
it
went
deep
o
ringan
i
cried
it
me
that
to
blame
you
got
it
trying
to
save
me
you
not
going
to
leave
me
ringan
he
was
easier
now
and
the
first
torrent
of
blood
had
subsided
but
his
breath
laboured
and
there
was
pain
in
his
eyes
i
got
my
call
he
said
faintly
who
would
have
thought
that
ninian
campbell
would
meet
his
death
from
an
indian
shabble
they
no
believe
it
at
tortuga
still
and
on
i
brought
him
water
in
my
hat
and
for
a
moment
he
breathed
freely
he
motioned
me
to
put
my
ear
close
you
send
word
to
the
folk
in
breadalbane
just
say
that
i
came
by
an
honest
end
cheer
up
lad
you
live
to
see
happy
days
yet
but
keep
mind
of
me
andrew
man
i
liked
you
well
and
would
have
been
blithe
to
keep
you
company
a
bit
longer
i
was
crying
like
a
child
there
was
a
little
gold
charm
on
a
cord
round
his
neck
now
dyed
with
his
blood
he
motioned
me
to
look
at
it
give
it
to
the
lass
he
whispered
i
had
once
a
lass
like
yon
and
i
aye
wore
it
for
her
sake
i
had
a
roving
life
with
many
ill
deeds
in
it
but
doubtless
the
almighty
will
make
allowances
can
you
say
a
bit
prayer
andrew
as
well
as
i
could
i
repeated
that
psalm
i
had
said
over
the
graves
by
the
rapidan
he
looked
at
me
with
eyes
as
clear
and
honest
as
a
child
death
dark
vale
i
will
fear
no
ill
he
repeated
after
me
that
minds
me
of
lang
syne
i
never
feared
muckle
on
earth
and
not
begin
now
i
saw
that
the
end
was
very
near
the
pain
had
gone
and
there
was
a
queer
innocence
in
his
lean
face
his
eyes
shut
and
opened
again
and
each
time
the
light
was
dimmer
suddenly
he
lifted
himself
the
horn
of
diarmaid
has
sounded
he
cried
and
dropped
back
in
my
arms
that
was
the
last
word
he
spoke
i
watched
by
him
till
the
dark
fell
and
long
after
then
as
the
moon
rose
i
bestirred
myself
and
looked
for
a
place
of
burial
i
would
not
have
him
lie
in
that
narrow
ravine
so
i
carried
him
into
the
meadow
and
found
a
hole
which
some
wild
beast
had
deserted
painfully
and
slowly
with
my
knife
i
made
it
into
a
shallow
grave
where
i
laid
him
with
some
boulders
above
then
i
think
i
flung
myself
on
the
earth
and
wept
my
fill
i
had
lost
my
best
of
friends
and
the
ache
of
regret
and
loneliness
was
too
bitter
to
bear
i
asked
for
nothing
better
than
to
join
him
soon
on
the
other
side
after
a
while
i
forced
myself
to
rise
he
had
praised
my
courage
that
very
day
and
if
i
was
to
be
true
to
him
i
must
be
true
to
my
trust
i
told
myself
that
ringan
would
never
have
countenanced
this
idle
grief
i
girt
on
his
sword
and
hung
the
gold
charm
round
my
neck
then
i
took
my
bearings
as
well
as
i
could
my
pistols
and
marched
into
the
woods
keeping
to
the
course
of
the
little
river
as
i
went
i
remember
that
always
a
little
ahead
i
seemed
to
hear
the
merry
lilt
of
ringan
whistling
chapter
xxiv
i
suffer
the
heathen
rage
as
i
stumbled
through
the
moonlit
forest
i
heard
ringan
tunes
ever
crooning
among
the
trees
first
it
was
the
old
mad
march
of
bundle
and
go
which
the
pipers
play
when
the
clans
are
rising
then
it
changed
to
the
lilt
of
colin
cattle
which
is
an
air
that
the
fairies
made
and
sung
in
the
ear
of
a
shepherd
who
fell
asleep
in
one
of
their
holy
places
and
then
it
lost
all
mortal
form
and
became
a
thing
as
faint
as
the
wind
in
the
or
the
humming
of
bees
in
clover
my
weary
legs
stepped
out
to
this
wizard
music
and
the
spell
of
it
lulled
my
fevered
thoughts
into
the
dull
patience
of
the
desperate
at
an
open
space
where
i
could
see
the
sky
i
tried
to
take
further
bearings
i
must
move
by
east
and
in
time
i
must
come
to
lawrence
i
do
not
think
i
had
any
hope
of
getting
there
for
i
knew
that
long
ere
this
the
man
who
escaped
must
have
returned
with
others
and
that
now
they
would
be
hot
on
my
trail
what
could
one
lad
do
in
a
wide
woodland
against
the
cunningest
trackers
on
earth
but
ringan
had
praised
my
courage
and
i
could
not
fail
him
i
should
go
on
till
i
died
and
i
did
not
think
that
would
be
very
long
my
pistols
pressed
against
my
side
and
ringan
sword
swung
by
my
thigh
i
was
determined
to
make
a
good
ending
since
that
was
all
now
left
to
me
in
that
hour
i
had
forgotten
about
everything
about
the
peril
of
virginia
even
about
elspeth
and
the
others
in
the
fort
on
the
there
comes
a
time
to
every
one
when
the
world
narrows
for
him
to
a
strait
alley
with
death
at
the
end
of
it
and
all
his
thoughts
are
fixed
on
that
waiting
enemy
of
mankind
my
senses
were
blunted
and
i
took
no
note
of
the
noises
of
the
forest
as
i
passed
down
a
ravine
a
stone
dropped
behind
me
but
i
did
not
pause
to
wonder
why
a
twig
crackled
on
my
left
but
it
did
not
disquiet
me
and
there
was
a
rustling
in
the
thicket
which
was
not
the
breeze
i
marked
nothing
as
i
plodded
on
with
vacant
mind
and
eye
so
when
i
tripped
on
a
vine
and
fell
i
was
scarcely
surprised
when
i
found
i
could
not
rise
men
had
sprung
up
silently
around
me
and
i
was
pinned
by
many
hands
they
trussed
me
with
ropes
binding
my
hands
cruelly
behind
my
back
and
swathing
my
legs
till
not
a
muscle
could
move
my
pistols
hung
idle
and
the
ropes
drove
the
hafts
into
my
flesh
this
is
the
end
thought
i
and
i
did
not
even
grieve
at
my
impotence
my
courage
now
was
of
the
passive
kind
not
to
act
but
to
endure
always
i
kept
telling
myself
that
i
must
be
brave
for
ringan
had
praised
my
courage
and
i
had
a
conviction
that
nothing
that
man
could
do
would
shake
me
thanks
be
to
god
my
quick
fancy
was
dulled
and
i
did
not
try
to
look
into
the
future
i
lived
for
the
moment
and
i
was
resolved
that
the
moment
should
find
me
unmoved
they
carried
me
to
where
their
horses
were
tied
up
in
a
glade
and
presently
we
were
galloping
towards
the
hills
myself
an
inert
bundle
strapped
across
an
indian
saddle
the
pain
of
the
motion
was
great
but
i
had
a
kind
of
grim
comfort
in
bearing
it
after
a
time
i
think
my
senses
left
me
and
i
slipped
into
a
stupor
from
which
i
woke
with
a
fiery
ache
at
every
joint
and
eyes
distended
with
a
blinding
heat
some
one
tossed
me
on
the
ground
where
i
lay
with
my
cheek
in
a
cool
wet
patch
of
earth
then
i
felt
my
bonds
being
unloosed
and
a
strong
arm
pulled
me
to
my
feet
when
it
let
go
i
dropped
again
and
not
till
many
hands
had
raised
me
and
set
me
on
a
log
could
i
look
round
at
my
whereabouts
i
was
in
a
crook
of
a
hill
glen
lit
with
a
great
radiance
of
moonlight
fires
dotted
the
flat
and
indian
tents
and
there
seemed
to
me
hundreds
of
savages
crowding
in
on
me
i
do
not
suppose
that
i
showed
any
fear
for
my
bodily
weakness
had
made
me
as
impassive
as
any
indian
presently
a
voice
spoke
to
me
but
i
could
not
understand
the
words
i
shook
my
head
feebly
and
another
spoke
this
time
i
knew
that
the
tongue
was
cherokee
a
speech
i
could
recognize
but
could
not
follow
again
i
shook
my
head
and
a
third
took
up
the
parable
this
one
spoke
the
powhatan
language
which
i
knew
and
i
replied
in
the
same
tongue
there
was
a
tall
man
wearing
in
his
hair
a
single
great
feather
whom
i
took
to
be
the
chief
he
spoke
to
me
through
the
interpreter
and
asked
me
whence
i
came
i
told
him
i
was
a
hunter
who
had
strayed
in
the
hills
he
asked
where
the
other
was
he
is
dead
i
said
dead
of
your
knives
but
five
of
your
braves
atoned
for
him
you
speak
truth
he
said
gravely
but
the
children
of
the
west
wind
do
not
suffer
the
death
of
their
sons
to
go
unrewarded
for
each
one
of
the
five
three
palefaces
shall
eat
the
dust
in
the
day
of
our
triumph
be
it
so
said
i
stoutly
though
i
felt
a
dreadful
nausea
coming
over
me
i
was
determined
to
keep
my
head
high
if
only
my
frail
body
would
not
fail
me
the
sons
of
the
west
wind
he
spoke
again
have
need
of
warriors
you
can
atone
for
the
slaughter
you
have
caused
and
the
blood
feud
will
be
forgotten
in
the
space
of
five
suns
we
shall
sweep
the
palefaces
into
the
sea
and
rule
all
the
land
to
the
eastern
waters
my
brother
is
a
man
of
his
hands
and
valour
is
dear
to
the
heart
of
onotawah
if
he
casts
in
his
lot
with
the
children
of
the
west
wind
a
wigwam
shall
be
his
and
a
daughter
of
our
race
to
wife
and
six
of
our
young
men
shall
follow
his
commands
will
my
brother
march
with
us
against
those
whom
god
has
delivered
to
us
for
our
prey
does
the
eagle
make
terms
with
the
kite
i
asked
and
fly
with
them
to
raid
his
own
eyrie
yes
i
will
join
with
you
and
march
with
you
till
i
have
delivered
you
to
perhaps
a
score
of
the
warriors
of
my
own
people
then
i
will
aid
them
in
making
carrion
of
you
heaven
knows
what
wrought
on
me
to
speak
like
this
i
a
poor
broken
fellow
face
to
face
with
a
hundred
i
think
my
mind
had
forsaken
me
altogether
and
i
spoke
like
a
drunken
man
with
a
tongue
not
my
own
i
had
only
the
one
idea
in
my
foolish
head
to
be
true
to
ringan
and
to
meet
the
death
of
which
i
was
assured
with
an
unflinching
face
yet
perhaps
my
very
madness
was
the
course
of
discretion
you
can
not
move
an
indian
by
pity
and
he
will
show
mercy
only
to
one
who
like
a
gamecock
asks
nothing
less
the
chief
heard
me
gravely
and
spoke
to
the
others
one
cried
out
something
in
a
savage
voice
and
for
a
moment
a
fierce
argument
was
raised
which
the
chief
settled
with
uplifted
hand
my
brother
speaks
bold
words
he
said
the
spirits
of
his
fathers
cry
out
for
the
companionship
of
such
a
hero
when
the
wrongs
of
our
race
have
been
avenged
i
wish
him
good
hunting
in
the
kingdom
of
the
sunset
they
took
me
and
stripped
me
mother
naked
has
any
man
who
reads
this
tale
ever
faced
an
enemy
in
his
bare
feet
if
so
he
will
know
that
the
heart
of
man
is
more
in
his
boots
than
philosophers
wot
of
without
them
he
feels
lost
and
unprepared
and
the
edge
gone
from
his
spirit
but
without
his
clothes
he
is
in
a
far
worse
case
the
winds
of
heaven
play
round
his
nakedness
every
thorn
and
twig
is
his
assailant
and
the
whole
of
him
seems
a
mark
for
the
arrows
of
his
foes
that
stripping
was
the
thing
that
brought
me
to
my
senses
i
recognized
that
i
was
to
be
the
subject
of
those
hellish
tortures
which
the
indians
use
the
tales
of
which
are
on
every
borderer
lips
and
yet
i
did
not
recognize
it
fully
or
my
courage
must
have
left
me
then
and
there
my
imagination
was
still
limping
and
i
foresaw
only
a
death
of
pain
not
the
horrid
incidents
of
its
preparation
death
i
could
face
and
i
summoned
up
every
shred
of
my
courage
ringan
voice
was
still
in
my
ear
his
airy
songs
still
sang
themselves
in
my
brain
i
would
not
shame
him
but
oh
how
i
envied
him
lying
all
troubles
past
in
his
quiet
grave
the
night
was
mild
and
the
yellow
radiance
of
the
moon
seemed
almost
i
sat
on
that
log
in
a
sort
of
stupor
watching
my
enemies
preparing
my
entertainment
one
thing
i
noted
that
there
were
no
women
in
the
camp
i
remembered
that
i
had
heard
that
the
most
devilish
tortures
were
those
which
the
squaws
devised
and
that
the
indian
men
were
apt
to
be
quicker
and
more
merciful
in
their
murderings
then
i
was
lifted
up
and
carried
to
a
flat
space
beside
the
stream
where
the
trunk
of
a
young
pine
had
been
set
upright
in
the
ground
a
man
waving
a
knife
and
singing
a
wild
song
danced
towards
me
he
seized
me
by
the
hair
and
i
actually
rejoiced
for
i
knew
that
the
pain
of
scalping
would
make
me
oblivious
of
all
else
but
he
only
drew
the
sharp
point
of
the
knife
in
a
circle
round
my
head
scarce
breaking
the
skin
i
had
grace
given
me
to
keep
a
stout
face
mainly
because
i
was
relieved
that
this
was
to
be
my
fate
he
put
the
knife
back
in
his
girdle
and
others
laid
hold
on
me
they
smeared
my
lower
limbs
with
some
kind
of
grease
which
smelt
of
resin
one
savage
who
had
picked
up
a
brand
from
one
of
the
little
fires
dropped
some
of
the
stuff
on
it
and
it
crackled
merrily
he
grinned
at
me
a
slow
diabolical
grin
they
lashed
me
to
the
stake
with
ropes
of
green
vine
then
they
piled
dry
hay
a
foot
deep
around
me
and
laid
above
it
wood
and
green
branches
to
make
the
fuel
still
greener
they
poured
water
on
it
at
the
moment
i
did
not
see
the
object
of
these
preparations
but
now
i
can
understand
it
the
dry
hay
would
serve
to
burn
my
legs
which
had
already
been
anointed
with
the
inflammable
grease
so
i
should
suffer
a
gradual
torture
for
it
would
be
long
ere
the
flames
reached
a
vital
part
i
think
they
erred
for
they
assumed
that
i
had
the
body
of
an
indian
which
does
not
perish
till
a
blow
is
struck
at
its
heart
whereas
i
am
confident
that
any
white
man
would
be
dead
of
the
anguish
long
ere
the
fire
had
passed
beyond
his
knees
i
think
that
was
the
most
awful
moment
of
my
life
indeed
i
could
not
have
endured
it
had
not
my
mind
been
drugged
and
my
body
stupid
with
fatigue
men
have
often
asked
me
what
were
my
thoughts
in
that
hour
while
the
faggots
were
laid
about
my
feet
i
can
not
tell
for
i
have
no
very
clear
memory
the
power
which
does
not
break
the
bruised
reed
tempered
the
storm
to
my
frailty
i
could
not
envisage
the
future
and
so
was
mercifully
enabled
to
look
only
to
the
moment
i
knew
that
pain
was
coming
but
i
was
already
in
pain
and
the
sick
man
does
not
trouble
himself
about
degrees
of
suffering
death
too
was
coming
but
for
that
i
had
been
long
ready
the
hardest
thing
that
man
can
do
is
to
endure
but
this
was
to
me
no
passive
endurance
it
was
an
active
struggle
to
show
a
fortitude
worthy
of
the
gallant
dead
so
i
must
suppose
that
i
hung
there
in
my
bonds
with
a
motionless
face
and
a
mouth
which
gave
out
no
cry
they
brought
the
faggots
and
poured
on
water
and
i
did
not
look
their
way
some
score
of
braves
began
a
war
dance
circling
round
me
waving
their
tomahawks
and
singing
their
wild
chants
for
me
they
did
not
break
the
moonlit
silence
i
was
hearing
other
sounds
and
seeing
far
other
sights
an
old
sad
song
of
ringan
was
in
my
ears
something
about
an
exile
who
cried
out
in
france
for
the
red
heather
and
the
salt
winds
of
the
isles
the
deep
it
ran
the
bell
of
the
dun
deer
far
my
castle
is
sands
and
my
homelands
are
a
stranger
and
the
air
brought
back
in
a
flash
my
own
little
house
on
the
grey
of
douglasdale
the
cluck
of
hens
about
the
doors
on
a
hot
summer
morn
the
crying
of
plovers
in
the
windy
aprils
the
smell
of
peatsmoke
when
the
snow
drifted
over
cairntable
has
never
been
my
failing
but
all
at
once
i
had
a
vision
of
my
own
land
the
cradle
of
my
race
and
unforgotten
over
the
leagues
of
sea
somehow
the
thought
strengthened
me
i
had
now
something
besides
the
thought
of
ringan
to
keep
my
heart
firm
if
all
hell
laid
hold
on
me
i
must
stand
fast
for
the
honour
of
my
own
folk
the
edge
of
the
pile
was
lit
and
the
flames
crackled
through
the
hay
below
the
faggots
the
smoke
rose
in
clouds
and
made
me
sneeze
suddenly
there
came
a
desperate
tickling
in
my
scalp
where
the
knife
had
pricked
little
things
began
to
tease
me
notably
the
ache
of
my
swollen
wrists
and
the
intolerable
cramp
in
my
legs
then
came
a
sharp
burst
of
pain
as
a
tongue
of
flame
licked
on
my
anointed
ankles
anguish
like
ran
through
my
frame
i
think
i
would
have
cried
out
if
my
tongue
had
had
the
power
suddenly
i
envisaged
the
dreadful
death
which
was
coming
all
was
wiped
from
my
mind
all
thought
of
ringan
and
home
and
honour
everything
but
this
awful
fear
happily
the
smoke
hid
my
face
which
must
have
been
distraught
with
panic
the
seconds
seemed
endless
i
prayed
that
unconsciousness
would
come
i
prayed
for
death
i
prayed
for
respite
i
was
mad
with
the
furious
madness
of
a
tortured
animal
and
the
immortal
soul
had
fled
from
me
and
left
only
a
husk
of
pitiful
and
shrinking
flesh
suddenly
there
came
a
lull
a
dozen
buckets
of
water
were
flung
on
the
pile
and
the
flames
fell
to
smouldering
ashes
the
smoke
thinned
and
i
saw
the
circle
of
my
tormentors
the
chief
spoke
and
asked
me
if
my
purpose
still
held
with
the
cool
shock
of
the
water
one
moment
of
bodily
comfort
returned
to
me
and
with
it
a
faint
revival
of
my
spirit
but
it
was
of
no
set
intention
that
i
answered
as
i
did
my
bones
were
molten
with
fright
and
i
had
not
one
ounce
of
bravery
in
me
something
not
myself
took
hold
on
me
and
spoke
for
me
ringan
tunes
a
brisk
one
this
time
lilted
in
my
ear
i
could
not
believe
my
own
voice
but
i
rejoice
to
say
that
my
reply
was
to
consign
every
indian
in
america
to
the
devil
i
shook
with
fear
when
i
had
spoken
i
looked
to
see
them
bring
dry
fuel
and
light
the
pile
again
but
i
had
played
a
wiser
part
than
i
knew
the
chief
gave
an
order
the
faggots
were
cleared
my
bonds
were
cut
and
i
was
led
away
from
the
stake
the
pain
of
my
cramped
and
scorched
limbs
was
horrible
but
i
had
just
enough
sense
left
to
shut
my
teeth
and
make
no
sound
the
chief
looked
at
me
long
and
calmly
as
i
drooped
before
him
for
there
was
no
power
in
my
legs
he
was
an
savage
with
the
most
grave
and
searching
eyes
sleep
brother
he
said
at
dawn
we
will
take
further
counsel
i
forced
some
kind
of
lightness
into
my
voice
sleep
will
be
grateful
i
said
for
i
have
come
many
miles
this
day
and
the
welcome
i
have
got
this
evening
has
been
too
warm
for
a
weary
man
the
indian
nodded
the
jest
was
after
his
own
taste
i
was
carried
to
a
teepee
and
shown
a
couch
of
dry
fern
a
young
man
rubbed
some
oil
on
my
scorched
legs
which
relieved
the
pain
of
them
but
no
pain
on
earth
could
have
kept
me
awake
i
did
not
glide
but
pitched
headforemost
into
sleep
chapter
xxv
events
on
the
my
body
was
too
sore
to
suffer
me
to
sleep
dreamlessly
but
my
dreams
were
pleasant
i
thought
i
was
in
a
sunny
place
with
elspeth
and
that
she
had
braided
a
coronet
of
wild
flowers
for
her
hair
they
were
simple
flowers
such
as
i
had
known
in
childhood
and
had
not
found
in
virginia
yarrow
and
queen
of
the
meadow
and
bluebells
and
the
little
eyebright
a
great
peace
filled
me
and
ringan
came
presently
to
us
and
spoke
in
his
old
happy
speech
was
to
the
accompaniment
of
elspeth
merry
laughter
that
i
wakened
to
find
myself
in
a
dark
place
with
a
buffalo
robe
laid
over
me
and
no
stitch
of
clothing
on
my
frame
that
wakening
was
bitter
indeed
i
opened
my
eyes
to
another
day
of
pain
and
peril
with
no
hope
of
deliverance
for
usual
i
am
one
of
those
who
rise
with
a
glad
heart
and
a
great
zest
for
whatever
the
light
may
bring
now
as
i
moved
my
limbs
i
found
aches
everywhere
and
but
little
strength
in
my
bones
slowly
the
events
of
the
last
day
came
back
to
me
the
journey
in
the
dripping
woods
the
fight
in
the
ravine
the
death
of
my
comrade
the
long
horror
of
the
hours
of
torture
no
man
can
be
a
hero
at
such
an
awakening
i
had
not
the
courage
of
a
chicken
in
my
soul
and
could
have
wept
with
weakness
and
terror
i
felt
my
body
over
and
made
out
that
i
had
taken
no
very
desperate
hurt
my
joints
were
swollen
with
the
bonds
and
every
sinew
seemed
as
stiff
as
wire
the
skin
had
been
scorched
on
my
shins
and
feet
and
was
peeling
off
in
patches
but
the
ointment
which
had
been
rubbed
on
it
had
taken
the
worst
ache
out
of
the
wounds
i
tottered
to
my
feet
and
found
that
i
could
stand
and
even
move
slowly
like
an
old
man
my
clothes
had
been
brought
back
and
laid
beside
me
and
with
much
difficulty
i
got
into
them
but
i
gave
up
the
effort
to
get
my
stockings
and
boots
over
my
scorched
legs
my
pistols
too
had
been
restored
and
ringan
sword
and
the
gold
amulet
he
had
entrusted
to
me
somehow
in
the
handling
of
me
my
store
of
cartouches
had
disappeared
from
my
pockets
my
pistols
were
loaded
and
ready
for
use
but
that
was
the
extent
of
my
defences
for
i
was
no
more
good
with
ringan
sword
than
with
an
indian
bow
a
young
lad
brought
me
some
maize
porridge
and
a
skin
of
water
i
could
eat
little
of
the
food
but
i
drank
the
water
to
the
last
drop
for
my
throat
was
as
dry
as
the
nether
pit
after
that
i
lay
down
on
my
couch
again
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
would
need
to
treasure
every
atom
of
my
strength
the
meal
had
put
a
little
heart
in
me
heart
enough
to
wait
dismally
on
the
next
happening
presently
the
chief
whom
they
called
onotawah
stood
at
the
tent
door
and
with
him
a
man
who
spoke
the
powhatan
tongue
greeting
brother
he
said
greeting
i
answered
in
the
stoutest
tone
i
could
muster
i
come
from
the
council
of
the
young
men
where
the
blood
of
our
kin
cries
for
the
avenger
the
sons
of
the
west
wind
have
seen
the
courage
of
the
stranger
and
would
give
him
the
right
of
combat
as
a
free
man
and
a
brave
is
my
brother
ready
to
meet
our
young
men
in
battle
i
was
about
as
fit
to
right
as
an
old
horse
to
leap
a
fence
but
i
had
the
wit
to
see
that
my
only
hope
lay
in
a
bold
front
at
any
rate
a
clean
death
in
battle
was
better
than
burning
and
my
despair
was
too
deep
to
let
me
quibble
about
the
manner
of
leaving
this
world
you
see
my
condition
i
said
i
am
somewhat
broken
with
travel
and
wounds
but
such
as
i
am
i
am
willing
to
meet
your
warriors
send
them
one
at
a
time
or
in
battalions
and
i
am
ready
for
them
it
was
childish
brag
but
i
think
i
must
have
delivered
it
with
some
spirit
for
i
saw
approbation
in
his
eye
when
we
fight
we
fight
not
as
butchers
but
as
he
said
the
brother
of
one
of
the
dead
will
take
on
himself
the
cause
of
our
tribe
if
he
slay
you
our
honour
is
avenged
if
he
be
slain
we
save
you
alive
and
carry
you
with
us
as
we
march
to
the
rising
sun
i
am
content
i
said
though
i
was
very
little
content
what
earthly
chance
stood
i
against
a
lithe
young
brave
accustomed
from
his
childhood
to
war
i
thought
of
a
duel
with
knives
or
tomahawks
for
i
could
not
believe
that
i
would
be
allowed
to
keep
my
pistols
it
was
a
very
combatant
who
rose
and
staggered
after
onotawah
into
the
clear
morning
the
cloudy
weather
had
gone
and
the
glen
where
we
lay
was
filled
with
sun
and
bright
colours
even
in
my
misery
i
saw
the
fairness
of
the
spectacle
and
the
cool
plunge
of
the
stream
was
grateful
to
my
throbbing
eyes
the
whole
clan
was
waiting
a
hundred
warriors
as
tall
and
as
any
captain
could
desire
i
bore
no
to
my
captors
indeed
i
viewed
them
with
a
respect
i
had
never
felt
for
indians
before
they
were
so
free
in
their
walk
so
slim
and
upstanding
so
hawklike
in
eye
and
feature
and
withal
so
grave
that
i
could
not
but
admire
them
if
the
tidewater
was
to
perish
be
at
the
hands
of
no
unworthy
foes
a
man
stood
out
from
the
others
a
tall
savage
with
a
hard
face
who
looked
at
me
with
eyes
of
hate
i
recognized
my
opponent
whom
the
chief
called
by
some
name
like
mayoga
before
us
on
the
across
the
stream
was
a
wood
with
its
limits
cut
as
clear
on
the
meadow
as
a
coppice
in
a
nobleman
park
was
maybe
half
a
mile
long
as
it
stretched
up
the
slope
and
about
the
same
at
its
greatest
width
the
shape
was
like
a
stout
bean
with
a
hollow
on
one
side
and
down
the
middle
ran
the
gorge
of
a
mountain
stream
onotawah
pointed
to
the
wood
hearken
brother
to
the
customs
of
our
race
in
such
combats
in
that
thicket
the
twain
of
you
fight
mayoga
will
enter
at
one
end
and
you
at
the
other
and
once
among
the
trees
it
is
his
business
to
slay
you
as
he
pleases
and
as
he
can
what
are
the
weapons
i
asked
what
you
please
you
have
a
sword
and
your
little
guns
mayoga
laughed
loud
my
bow
is
sufficient
he
cried
see
i
leave
knife
and
tomahawk
behind
and
he
cast
them
on
the
grass
not
to
be
outdone
i
took
off
my
sword
though
that
was
more
an
encumbrance
than
a
weapon
i
have
but
the
two
shots
i
said
then
i
will
take
but
the
two
arrows
cried
my
opponent
shaking
the
rest
out
of
his
quiver
and
at
this
there
was
a
murmur
of
applause
there
were
some
notions
of
decency
among
these
western
indians
i
bade
him
take
a
quiverful
you
will
need
them
said
i
looking
as
truculent
as
my
chicken
heart
would
permit
me
they
took
me
to
the
eastern
side
of
the
wood
and
there
we
waited
for
the
signal
which
was
a
musket
shot
telling
me
that
mayoga
was
ready
to
enter
at
the
opposite
end
my
companions
were
friendly
enough
and
seemed
to
look
on
the
duel
as
a
kind
of
sport
i
could
not
understand
their
tongue
but
i
fancy
that
they
wagered
among
themselves
on
the
issue
if
indeed
that
was
in
doubt
or
at
any
rate
on
the
time
before
i
should
fall
they
had
forgotten
that
they
had
tortured
me
the
night
before
and
one
clapped
me
on
the
shoulder
and
seemed
to
encourage
me
another
pointed
to
my
raw
shins
and
wound
some
kind
of
soft
healing
fibre
round
my
feet
and
ankles
i
did
my
best
to
keep
a
stout
face
and
when
the
shot
came
i
waved
my
hand
to
them
and
plunged
boldly
into
the
leafy
darkness
but
out
of
the
presence
of
men
my
courage
departed
and
i
became
the
prey
of
dismal
fear
how
was
i
with
my
babyish
woodcraft
to
contend
for
a
moment
against
an
indian
who
was
as
subtle
and
as
a
wild
beast
the
wood
was
mostly
of
great
oaks
and
chestnuts
with
a
dense
scrub
of
vines
and
undergrowth
and
in
the
steepest
parts
of
the
many
mossgrown
rocks
i
found
every
movement
painful
in
that
rough
and
matted
place
for
one
thing
i
made
an
unholy
noise
my
tender
limbs
shrank
from
every
stone
and
twig
and
again
and
again
i
rolled
over
with
the
pain
of
it
sweat
blinded
my
eyes
and
the
fatigues
of
yesterday
made
my
breath
labour
like
a
foundered
horse
my
first
plan
if
the
instinct
of
blind
terror
can
be
called
a
plan
was
to
lie
hid
in
some
thick
place
and
trust
to
getting
the
first
shot
at
my
enemy
when
he
found
me
but
i
realized
that
i
could
not
do
this
my
broken
nerves
would
not
suffer
me
to
lie
hidden
better
the
torture
of
movement
than
such
terrible
patience
so
i
groped
my
way
on
starting
at
every
movement
in
the
thicket
once
i
roused
a
deer
which
broke
off
in
front
of
me
towards
my
adversary
that
would
tell
him
my
whereabouts
i
thought
and
for
some
time
i
lay
still
with
a
palpitating
heart
but
soon
the
silence
resumed
its
sway
a
deathlike
silence
with
far
off
the
faint
tinkle
of
water
by
and
by
i
reached
the
stream
the
course
of
which
made
an
open
space
a
few
yards
wide
in
the
trees
the
sight
of
its
cool
foaming
current
made
me
reckless
i
dipped
my
face
in
it
drank
deep
of
it
and
let
it
flow
over
my
burning
legs
then
i
scrambled
up
the
other
bank
and
entered
my
enemy
half
of
the
wood
he
had
missed
a
fine
chance
i
thought
in
not
killing
me
by
the
water
edge
and
this
escape
and
the
momentary
refreshment
of
the
stream
heartened
me
enough
to
carry
me
some
way
into
his
territory
the
wood
was
thinner
here
and
the
ground
less
cumbered
i
moved
from
tree
to
tree
crawling
in
the
open
bits
and
scanning
each
circle
of
green
dusk
before
i
moved
a
fluttered
on
my
right
and
i
lay
long
watching
its
flight
something
moved
ahead
of
me
but
was
only
a
squirrel
then
came
a
mocking
laugh
behind
me
i
turned
sharply
but
saw
nothing
far
up
in
the
branches
there
sounded
the
slow
flap
of
an
owl
flight
many
noises
succeeded
and
suddenly
came
one
which
froze
my
blood
the
harsh
scream
of
a
hawk
my
enemy
was
playing
with
me
and
calling
the
wild
things
to
mock
me
i
went
on
a
little
and
then
turned
up
the
hill
to
where
a
clump
of
pines
made
a
darker
patch
in
the
woodland
all
was
quiet
again
and
my
eyes
searched
the
dusk
for
the
sign
of
human
life
then
suddenly
i
saw
something
which
stiffened
me
against
a
trunk
forty
paces
off
in
the
dusk
a
face
was
looking
from
behind
a
tree
it
was
to
the
west
of
me
and
was
looking
downhill
towards
a
patch
of
undergrowth
i
noted
the
long
feather
the
black
forelock
the
red
skin
of
the
forehead
at
the
sight
for
the
first
time
the
zest
of
the
pursuit
filled
me
and
i
forgot
my
pain
had
i
outwitted
my
wily
foe
and
by
some
miracle
stolen
a
march
on
him
i
dared
not
believe
it
but
yet
as
i
rubbed
my
eyes
i
could
not
doubt
it
i
had
got
my
chance
and
had
taken
him
unawares
the
face
still
peered
intently
downhill
i
lifted
a
pistol
took
careful
aim
and
fired
at
the
patch
of
red
skin
a
thousand
echoes
rang
through
the
wood
the
bullet
had
grazed
the
tree
trunk
and
the
face
was
gone
but
whither
did
a
dead
man
lie
behind
the
trunk
or
had
a
wounded
man
crawled
into
cover
i
waited
breathlessly
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
went
forward
with
my
second
pistol
at
the
cock
there
was
nothing
behind
the
tree
only
a
piece
of
red
bark
with
a
bullet
hole
through
it
some
greasy
horsehair
and
a
feather
and
then
from
many
quarters
seemed
to
come
a
wicked
laughter
i
leaned
against
the
trunk
with
a
deadly
nausea
clutching
at
my
heart
poor
fool
i
had
rejoiced
for
a
second
only
to
be
dashed
into
utter
despair
i
do
not
think
i
had
ever
had
much
hope
but
now
i
was
convinced
that
all
was
over
the
water
had
made
my
burns
worse
and
disappointment
had
sapped
the
little
remnants
of
my
strength
my
one
desire
was
to
get
out
of
this
ghoulish
thicket
and
die
by
the
the
cool
sound
of
it
would
be
a
fitting
dirge
for
a
foolish
fellow
who
had
wandered
far
from
his
home
i
could
hear
the
plunge
of
it
and
struggled
towards
it
i
was
long
past
taking
any
care
i
stumbled
and
slipped
along
the
my
breath
labouring
and
a
moaning
at
my
lips
from
sheer
agony
and
weakness
if
an
arrow
sped
between
my
ribs
i
would
still
reach
the
water
for
i
was
determined
to
die
with
my
legs
in
its
flow
suddenly
it
was
before
me
i
came
out
on
a
mossy
rock
above
a
deep
clear
pool
into
which
a
cascade
tumbled
i
knelt
feebly
on
the
stone
gazing
at
the
blue
depths
and
then
i
lifted
my
eyes
there
on
a
rock
on
the
other
side
stood
my
enemy
he
had
an
arrow
fitted
to
his
bow
and
as
i
looked
he
shot
it
struck
me
on
the
right
arm
pinning
it
just
above
the
elbow
the
pistol
which
i
had
been
carrying
aimlessly
slipped
from
my
nerveless
hand
to
the
moss
on
which
i
kneeled
that
sudden
shock
cleared
my
wits
i
was
at
his
mercy
and
he
knew
it
i
could
see
every
detail
of
him
twenty
yards
off
across
the
water
he
stood
there
as
calm
and
light
as
if
he
had
just
arisen
from
rest
his
polished
limbs
shining
in
the
glow
of
the
sun
the
muscles
on
his
right
arm
rippling
as
he
moved
his
bow
madman
that
i
was
ever
to
hope
to
contend
with
such
dauntless
youth
such
tireless
vigour
there
was
a
cruel
smile
on
his
face
he
had
me
in
his
clutches
like
a
cat
with
a
mouse
and
he
was
going
to
get
the
full
zest
of
it
i
kneeled
before
him
with
my
strength
gone
my
right
arm
crippled
he
could
choose
his
target
at
his
leisure
for
i
could
not
resist
i
saw
the
gloating
joy
in
his
eyes
he
knew
his
power
and
meant
to
miss
nothing
of
its
savour
yet
in
that
fell
predicament
god
gave
me
back
my
courage
but
i
took
a
queer
way
of
showing
it
i
began
to
whimper
as
if
in
abject
fear
every
limb
was
relaxed
in
terror
and
i
grovelled
on
my
knees
before
him
i
made
feeble
plucks
at
the
arrow
in
my
right
arm
and
my
shoulder
drooped
almost
to
the
sod
but
all
the
time
my
other
hand
was
behind
my
back
edging
its
way
to
the
pistol
my
fingers
clutched
at
the
butt
and
slowly
i
began
to
withdraw
it
till
i
had
it
safe
in
the
shadow
of
my
pocket
my
enemy
did
not
know
that
i
was
he
fitted
a
second
arrow
to
his
bow
while
his
lips
curved
maliciously
all
the
demoniac
pantherlike
cruelty
of
his
race
looked
at
me
out
of
his
deep
eyes
he
was
taking
his
time
about
it
unwilling
to
lose
the
slightest
flavour
of
his
vengeance
i
played
up
to
him
nobly
squirming
as
if
in
an
agony
of
terror
but
by
this
time
i
had
got
a
comfortable
posture
on
the
rock
and
my
left
shoulder
was
towards
him
at
last
he
made
his
choice
and
so
did
i
never
thought
that
i
could
miss
for
if
i
had
had
any
doubt
i
should
have
failed
i
was
as
confident
in
my
sureness
as
any
saint
in
the
mercy
of
god
he
raised
his
bow
but
it
never
reached
his
shoulder
my
left
arm
shot
out
and
my
last
bullet
went
through
his
brain
he
toppled
forward
and
plunged
into
the
pool
the
grease
from
his
body
floated
up
and
made
a
scum
on
the
surface
then
i
broke
off
the
arrow
and
pulled
it
out
of
my
arm
putting
the
pieces
in
my
pocket
the
water
cleared
and
i
could
see
him
lying
in
the
cool
blue
depths
his
eyes
staring
his
mouth
open
and
a
little
dark
eddy
about
his
forehead
chapter
xxvi
shalah
i
came
out
of
the
wood
a
new
being
my
wounded
arm
and
my
torn
and
inflamed
limbs
were
forgotten
i
held
my
head
high
and
walked
like
a
free
man
it
was
not
that
i
had
slain
my
enemy
and
been
delivered
from
deadly
peril
nor
had
i
any
clearer
light
on
my
next
step
but
i
had
suddenly
got
the
conviction
that
god
was
on
my
side
and
that
i
need
not
fear
what
man
could
do
unto
me
you
may
call
it
the
madness
of
a
lad
whose
body
and
spirit
had
been
tried
to
but
madness
or
no
it
gave
me
infinite
courage
and
in
that
hour
i
would
have
dared
every
savage
on
earth
i
found
some
indians
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
told
one
who
spoke
powhatan
the
issue
of
the
fight
i
flung
the
broken
arrow
on
the
ground
that
is
my
token
i
said
you
will
find
the
other
in
the
pool
below
the
cascade
then
i
strode
towards
the
tents
looking
every
man
i
passed
squarely
in
the
eyes
no
one
spoke
no
one
hindered
me
every
face
was
like
a
graven
image
i
reached
the
teepee
in
which
i
had
spent
the
night
and
flung
myself
down
on
the
rude
couch
in
a
minute
i
was
sunk
in
a
heavy
sleep
i
woke
to
see
two
men
standing
in
the
tent
door
one
was
the
chief
onotawah
and
the
other
a
tall
indian
who
wore
no
war
paint
they
came
towards
me
and
the
light
fell
on
the
face
of
the
second
to
my
amazement
i
recognized
shalah
he
put
a
finger
on
his
lip
and
though
my
heart
clamoured
for
news
i
held
my
peace
they
squatted
on
a
heap
of
skins
and
spoke
in
their
own
tongue
then
shalah
addressed
me
in
english
the
maiden
is
safe
brother
there
will
be
no
more
fighting
at
the
stockade
those
who
assaulted
us
were
of
my
own
tribe
and
yesterday
i
reasoned
with
them
then
he
spoke
to
the
chief
and
translated
for
me
he
says
that
you
have
endured
the
ordeal
of
the
stake
and
have
slain
your
enemy
in
fight
and
that
now
you
will
go
before
the
great
sachem
for
his
judgment
that
is
the
custom
of
our
people
he
turned
to
onotawah
again
and
his
tone
was
high
and
scornful
he
spoke
as
if
he
were
the
chief
and
the
other
were
the
minion
and
what
was
strangest
of
all
onotawah
replied
meekly
shalah
rose
to
his
feet
and
strode
to
the
door
pointing
down
the
glen
with
his
hand
he
seemed
to
menace
the
other
his
nostrils
quivered
with
contempt
and
his
voice
was
barbed
with
passion
onotawah
bowed
his
head
and
said
nothing
then
he
seemed
to
dismiss
him
and
the
proud
chief
walked
out
of
the
teepee
like
a
disconsolate
schoolboy
instantly
shalah
turned
to
me
and
inquired
about
my
wounds
he
looked
at
the
hole
in
my
arm
and
at
my
scorched
legs
and
from
his
belt
took
a
phial
of
ointment
which
he
rubbed
on
the
former
he
passed
his
cool
hands
over
my
brow
and
felt
the
beating
of
my
heart
you
are
weary
brother
and
somewhat
scarred
but
there
is
no
grave
hurt
what
of
the
master
i
told
him
of
ringan
end
he
bent
his
head
and
then
sprang
up
and
held
his
hands
high
speaking
in
a
strange
tongue
i
looked
at
his
eyes
and
they
were
ablaze
with
fire
my
people
slew
him
he
cried
by
the
shades
of
my
fathers
a
score
shall
keep
him
company
as
slaves
in
the
great
talk
no
more
of
blood
i
said
he
was
amply
avenged
was
i
who
slew
him
for
he
died
to
save
me
he
made
a
christian
end
and
i
will
not
have
his
memory
stained
by
more
murders
but
oh
shalah
what
a
man
died
yonder
he
made
me
tell
every
incident
of
the
story
and
he
cried
out
impassive
though
he
was
at
the
in
the
neck
of
the
gorge
i
have
seen
it
he
cried
i
have
seen
his
bright
steel
flash
and
men
go
down
like
ripe
fruit
tell
me
brother
did
he
sing
all
the
while
as
was
his
custom
would
i
had
been
by
his
side
then
he
told
me
of
what
had
befallen
at
the
stockade
the
dead
man
told
me
a
tale
for
by
the
mark
on
his
forehead
i
knew
that
he
was
of
my
own
house
when
you
and
the
master
had
gone
i
went
into
the
woods
and
picked
up
the
trail
of
our
foes
i
found
them
in
a
crook
of
the
hills
and
went
among
them
in
peace
they
knew
me
and
my
word
was
law
unto
them
no
living
thing
will
come
near
the
stockade
save
the
wild
beasts
of
the
forest
be
at
ease
in
thy
mind
brother
the
news
was
a
mighty
consolation
but
i
was
still
deeply
mystified
you
speak
of
your
tribe
but
these
men
were
no
senecas
he
smiled
gravely
listen
brother
he
said
the
white
men
of
the
tidewater
called
me
seneca
and
i
suffered
the
name
but
i
am
of
a
greater
and
princelier
house
than
the
sons
of
the
cat
some
little
while
ago
i
spoke
to
you
of
the
man
who
travelled
to
the
western
seas
and
of
his
son
who
returned
to
his
own
people
i
am
the
son
of
him
who
returned
i
spoke
of
the
doings
of
my
own
kin
but
what
is
your
nation
then
i
cried
one
so
great
that
these
little
clanlets
of
cherokee
and
monacan
and
even
the
multitudes
of
the
long
house
are
but
slaves
and
horseboys
by
their
side
we
dwelt
far
beyond
these
mountains
towards
the
setting
sun
in
a
plain
where
the
rivers
are
like
seas
and
the
cornlands
wider
than
all
the
virginian
manors
but
there
came
trouble
in
our
royal
house
and
my
father
returned
to
find
a
generation
which
had
forgotten
the
deeds
of
their
forefathers
so
he
took
his
own
tribe
who
still
remembered
the
house
of
the
sun
and
because
his
heart
was
unquiet
with
longing
for
that
which
is
forbidden
to
man
he
journeyed
eastward
and
found
a
new
home
in
a
valley
of
these
hills
thine
eyes
have
seen
it
they
call
it
the
shenandoah
i
remembered
that
smiling
eden
i
had
seen
from
that
and
how
shalah
had
spoken
that
very
name
we
dwelt
there
he
continued
while
i
grew
to
manhood
living
happily
in
peace
hunting
the
buffalo
and
deer
and
tilling
our
cornlands
then
the
time
came
when
the
great
spirit
called
for
my
father
and
i
was
left
with
the
kingship
of
the
tribe
strange
things
meantime
had
befallen
our
nation
in
the
west
broken
clans
had
come
down
from
the
north
and
there
had
been
many
battles
and
there
had
been
blight
and
storms
and
sickness
so
that
they
were
grown
poor
and
harassed
likewise
men
had
arisen
who
preached
to
them
discontent
and
other
races
of
a
lesser
breed
had
joined
themselves
to
them
my
own
tribe
had
become
fewer
for
the
young
men
did
not
stay
in
our
valley
but
drifted
back
to
the
west
to
that
nation
we
had
come
from
or
went
north
to
the
wars
with
the
white
man
or
became
lonely
hunters
in
the
hills
then
from
the
south
along
the
mountain
crests
came
another
people
a
squat
and
murderous
people
who
watched
us
from
the
ridges
and
bided
their
chance
the
cherokees
i
asked
even
so
i
speak
of
a
hundred
moons
back
when
i
was
yet
a
stripling
with
little
experience
in
war
i
saw
the
peril
but
i
could
not
think
that
such
a
race
could
vie
with
the
children
of
the
sun
but
one
black
night
in
the
moon
of
wildfowl
the
raiders
descended
in
a
torrent
and
took
us
unprepared
what
had
been
a
happy
people
dwelling
with
full
barns
and
populous
wigwams
became
in
a
night
a
desolation
our
wives
and
children
were
slain
or
carried
captive
and
on
every
cherokee
belt
hung
the
scalps
of
my
warriors
some
fled
westwards
to
our
nation
but
they
were
few
that
lived
and
the
tribe
of
shalah
went
out
like
a
torch
in
a
roaring
river
i
slew
many
men
that
night
for
the
gods
of
my
fathers
guided
my
arm
death
i
sought
but
could
not
find
it
and
by
and
by
i
was
alone
in
the
woods
with
twenty
scars
and
a
heart
as
empty
as
a
gourd
then
i
turned
my
steps
to
the
rising
sun
and
the
land
of
the
white
man
for
there
was
no
more
any
place
for
me
in
the
councils
of
my
own
people
all
this
was
many
moons
ago
and
since
then
i
have
been
a
wanderer
among
strangers
while
i
reigned
in
my
valley
i
heard
of
the
white
man
magic
and
of
the
power
of
his
gods
and
i
longed
to
prove
them
now
i
have
learned
many
things
which
were
hid
from
the
eyes
of
our
oldest
men
i
have
learned
that
a
man
may
be
a
great
brave
and
yet
gentle
and
merciful
as
was
the
master
i
have
learned
that
a
man
may
be
a
lover
of
peace
and
quiet
ways
and
have
no
lust
of
battle
in
his
heart
and
yet
when
the
need
comes
be
more
valiant
than
the
best
even
as
you
brother
i
have
learned
that
the
god
of
the
white
men
was
himself
a
man
who
endured
the
ordeal
of
the
stake
for
the
welfare
of
his
enemies
i
have
seen
cruelty
and
cowardice
and
folly
among
his
worshippers
but
i
have
also
seen
that
his
faith
can
put
spirit
into
a
coward
heart
and
make
heroes
of
mean
men
i
do
not
grudge
my
years
of
wandering
they
have
taught
me
such
knowledge
as
the
sachems
of
my
nation
never
dreamed
of
and
they
have
given
me
two
comrades
after
my
own
heart
one
was
he
who
died
yesterday
and
the
other
is
now
by
my
side
these
words
of
shalah
did
not
make
me
proud
for
things
were
too
serious
for
vanity
but
they
served
to
confirm
in
me
my
strange
exaltation
i
felt
as
one
dedicated
to
a
mighty
task
tell
me
what
is
the
invasion
which
threatens
the
tidewater
the
whole
truth
is
not
known
to
me
but
from
the
speech
of
my
tribesmen
it
seems
that
the
children
of
the
west
wind
twelve
moons
ago
struck
their
tents
and
resolved
to
seek
a
new
country
there
is
a
restlessness
comes
upon
all
indian
peoples
once
in
every
five
generations
it
fell
upon
my
grandfather
and
he
travelled
towards
the
sunset
and
now
it
has
fallen
upon
the
whole
race
of
the
sun
as
they
were
on
the
eve
of
journeying
there
came
to
them
a
prophet
who
told
them
that
god
would
lead
them
not
towards
the
west
as
was
the
tradition
of
the
elders
but
eastwards
to
the
sea
and
the
dwellings
of
the
palefaces
is
that
the
crazy
white
man
we
have
heard
of
he
is
of
your
race
brother
what
his
spell
is
i
know
not
but
it
works
mightily
among
my
people
they
tell
me
that
he
hath
bodily
converse
with
devils
and
that
god
whispers
his
secrets
to
him
in
the
his
god
hath
told
him
so
runs
the
tale
that
he
hath
chosen
the
children
of
the
sun
for
his
peculiar
people
and
laid
on
them
the
charge
of
sweeping
the
white
men
off
the
earth
and
reigning
in
their
stead
from
the
hills
to
the
great
waters
do
you
believe
in
this
madman
shalah
i
asked
i
know
not
he
said
with
a
troubled
face
i
fear
one
possessed
of
god
but
of
this
i
am
sure
that
the
road
of
the
children
of
the
west
wind
lies
not
eastward
but
westward
and
that
no
good
can
come
of
war
with
the
white
man
this
sachem
hath
laid
his
magic
on
others
than
our
people
for
the
cherokee
nation
and
all
the
broken
clans
of
the
hills
acknowledge
him
and
do
his
bidding
he
is
a
soldier
as
well
as
a
prophet
for
he
has
drilled
and
disposed
his
army
like
a
master
of
war
will
your
tribe
ally
themselves
with
cherokee
murderers
i
asked
that
question
of
this
man
onotawah
and
he
liked
it
little
he
says
that
his
people
distrust
this
alliance
with
a
race
they
scorn
and
i
do
not
think
they
pine
for
the
white
man
war
but
they
are
under
the
magic
of
this
prophet
and
presently
when
blood
begins
to
flow
they
will
warm
to
their
work
in
time
they
will
be
broken
but
that
time
will
not
be
soon
and
meanwhile
there
will
be
nothing
left
alive
between
the
hills
and
the
bay
of
chesapeake
do
you
know
their
plans
i
asked
the
cherokees
have
served
their
purpose
he
said
your
forecast
was
right
brother
they
have
drawn
the
fire
of
the
border
and
been
driven
in
a
rabble
far
south
to
the
roanoke
and
the
carolina
mountains
that
is
as
the
prophet
planned
and
now
while
the
white
men
hang
up
their
muskets
and
rejoice
heedlessly
in
their
triumph
my
nation
prepares
to
strike
the
moon
is
full
and
the
prophet
makes
intercession
with
his
god
at
dawn
they
march
and
by
twilight
they
will
have
swarmed
across
the
border
have
you
no
power
over
your
own
people
but
little
he
answered
i
have
been
too
long
absent
from
them
and
my
name
is
half
forgotten
yet
were
they
free
of
this
prophet
i
think
i
might
sway
them
for
i
know
their
ways
and
i
am
the
son
of
their
ancient
kings
but
for
the
present
his
magic
holds
them
in
thrall
they
listen
in
fear
to
one
who
hath
the
ear
of
god
i
arose
stretched
my
arms
and
yawned
they
carry
me
to
this
sachem
i
said
well
and
good
i
will
outface
this
blasphemous
liar
whoever
he
may
be
if
he
makes
big
magic
i
will
make
bigger
the
only
course
is
the
bold
course
if
i
can
humble
this
prophet
man
will
you
dissuade
your
nation
from
war
and
send
them
back
to
the
sunset
assuredly
he
said
wonderingly
but
what
is
your
plan
brother
none
i
answered
god
will
show
me
the
way
honesty
may
trust
in
him
as
well
as
madness
by
my
father
shade
you
are
a
man
brother
and
he
gave
me
the
indian
salute
a
very
weary
feckless
cripple
of
a
man
i
said
smiling
but
the
armies
of
heaven
are
on
my
side
shalah
take
my
pistols
and
sword
i
am
going
into
this
business
with
no
human
weapons
and
as
they
set
me
on
an
indian
horse
and
the
whole
tribe
turned
their
eyes
to
the
higher
glens
i
actually
rejoiced
or
i
know
not
which
i
was
but
i
know
that
i
had
no
fear
chapter
xxvii
how
i
strove
all
night
with
the
devil
it
was
late
in
the
evening
ere
we
reached
the
shelf
in
the
high
glens
which
was
the
headquarters
of
the
indian
host
i
rode
on
a
horse
between
onotawah
and
shalah
as
if
i
were
a
chief
and
no
prisoner
on
the
road
we
met
many
bands
of
indians
hastening
to
the
for
the
leader
had
flung
his
outposts
along
the
whole
base
of
the
range
and
the
chief
warriors
returned
to
the
plateau
for
the
last
ritual
no
man
spoke
a
word
and
when
we
met
other
companies
the
only
greeting
was
by
uplifted
hands
the
shelf
was
lit
with
fires
and
there
was
a
flare
of
torches
in
the
centre
i
saw
an
immense
multitude
of
lean
dark
faces
how
many
i
can
not
tell
but
ten
thousand
at
the
least
it
took
all
my
faith
to
withstand
the
awe
of
the
sight
for
these
men
were
not
the
common
indian
breed
but
a
race
nurtured
and
armed
for
great
wars
disciplined
to
follow
one
man
and
sharpened
to
a
in
spirit
perhaps
if
i
had
been
myself
a
campaigner
i
should
have
been
less
awed
by
the
spectacle
but
having
nothing
with
which
to
compare
it
i
judged
this
a
host
before
which
the
scattered
border
stockades
and
nicholson
scanty
militia
would
go
down
like
stubble
before
fire
at
the
head
of
the
plateau
just
under
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
facing
the
of
level
land
stood
a
big
tent
of
skins
before
it
was
a
square
pile
of
boulders
about
the
height
of
a
man
waist
heaped
on
the
top
with
brushwood
so
that
it
looked
like
a
rude
altar
around
this
the
host
had
gathered
sitting
mostly
on
the
ground
with
knees
drawn
to
the
chin
but
some
few
standing
like
sentries
under
arms
i
was
taken
to
the
middle
of
the
and
shalah
motioned
me
to
dismount
while
a
stripling
led
off
the
horses
my
legs
gave
under
me
for
they
were
still
very
feeble
and
i
sat
hunkered
up
on
the
sward
like
the
others
i
looked
for
shalah
and
onotawah
but
they
had
disappeared
and
i
was
left
alone
among
those
lines
of
dark
unknown
faces
i
waited
with
an
awe
on
my
spirits
against
which
i
struggled
in
vain
the
silence
of
so
vast
a
multitude
the
sputtering
torches
lighting
the
wild
amphitheatre
of
the
hills
the
strange
clearing
with
its
altar
the
mystery
of
the
immense
dusky
sky
and
the
memory
of
what
i
had
already
endured
all
weighed
on
me
with
the
sense
of
impending
doom
i
summoned
all
my
fortitude
to
my
aid
i
told
myself
that
ringan
believed
in
me
and
that
i
had
the
assurance
that
god
would
not
see
me
cast
down
but
such
courage
as
i
had
was
now
a
resolve
rather
than
any
exhilaration
of
spirits
a
brooding
darkness
lay
on
me
like
a
cloud
presently
the
hush
grew
deeper
and
from
the
tent
a
man
came
i
could
not
see
him
clearly
but
the
flickering
light
told
me
that
he
was
very
tall
and
that
like
the
indians
he
was
naked
to
the
middle
he
stood
behind
the
altar
and
began
some
incantation
it
was
in
the
indian
tongue
which
i
could
not
understand
the
voice
was
harsh
and
discordant
but
powerful
enough
to
fill
that
whole
circle
of
hill
it
seemed
to
rouse
the
passion
of
the
hearers
for
grave
faces
around
me
began
to
work
and
sighs
came
from
their
lips
then
at
a
word
from
the
figure
four
men
advanced
bearing
something
between
them
which
they
laid
on
the
altar
to
my
amazement
i
saw
that
it
was
a
great
yellow
panther
so
trussed
up
that
it
was
impotent
to
hurt
how
such
a
beast
had
ever
been
caught
alive
i
know
not
i
could
see
its
green
cat
eyes
glowing
in
the
dark
and
the
striving
of
its
muscles
and
hear
the
breath
hissing
from
its
muzzled
jaws
the
figure
raised
a
knife
and
plunged
it
into
the
throat
of
the
great
cat
the
slow
lapping
of
blood
broke
in
on
the
stillness
then
the
voice
shrilled
high
and
wild
i
could
see
that
the
man
had
marked
his
forehead
with
blood
and
that
his
hands
were
red
and
dripping
he
seemed
to
be
declaiming
some
savage
chant
to
which
my
neighbours
began
to
keep
time
with
their
bodies
wilder
and
wilder
it
grew
till
it
ended
in
a
scream
like
a
seamew
whoever
the
madman
was
he
knew
the
mystery
of
indian
souls
for
in
a
little
he
would
have
had
that
host
lusting
blindly
for
death
i
felt
the
spell
myself
piercing
through
my
awe
and
hatred
of
the
and
i
wo
say
but
that
my
weary
head
kept
time
with
the
others
to
that
weird
singing
a
man
brought
a
torch
and
lit
the
brushwood
on
the
altar
instantly
a
flame
rose
to
heaven
through
which
the
figure
of
the
magician
showed
fitfully
like
a
mountain
in
mist
that
act
broke
the
wizardry
for
me
to
sacrifice
a
cat
was
monstrous
and
horrible
but
it
was
also
uncouthly
silly
i
saw
the
magic
for
what
it
was
a
maniac
trickery
in
the
revulsion
i
grew
angry
and
my
anger
heartened
me
wonderfully
was
this
stupendous
quackery
to
bring
ruin
to
the
tidewater
though
i
had
to
choke
the
life
with
my
own
hands
out
of
that
warlock
throat
i
should
prevent
it
then
from
behind
the
fire
the
voice
began
again
but
this
time
i
understood
it
the
words
were
english
i
was
amazed
for
i
had
forgotten
that
i
knew
the
wizard
to
be
a
white
man
saith
the
lord
it
cried
to
the
bloody
city
i
will
make
the
pile
great
for
fire
heap
on
wood
kindle
the
fire
consume
the
flesh
and
spice
it
well
and
let
the
bones
be
he
poked
the
beast
on
the
altar
and
a
bit
of
burning
yellow
fur
fell
off
and
frizzled
on
the
ground
it
was
horrid
beyond
words
lewd
and
savage
and
impious
and
desperately
cruel
and
the
strange
thing
was
that
the
voice
was
familiar
thou
that
dwellest
upon
many
it
went
on
again
in
treasures
thine
end
is
come
and
the
measure
of
thy
covetousness
the
lord
of
hosts
hath
sworn
by
himself
saying
surely
i
will
fill
thee
with
men
as
with
with
that
last
word
there
came
over
me
a
flood
of
recollection
it
was
spoken
not
in
the
common
english
way
but
in
the
broad
manner
of
my
own
folk
i
saw
in
my
mind
eye
a
wet
moorland
and
heard
a
voice
inveighing
against
the
wickedness
of
those
in
high
places
i
smelled
the
foul
air
of
the
canongate
tolbooth
and
heard
this
same
man
testifying
against
the
vanity
of
the
world
it
was
the
voice
that
had
once
bidden
me
sing
jenny
nettles
harsh
and
strident
and
horrible
it
was
yet
the
voice
i
had
known
now
blaspheming
scripture
words
behind
that
gruesome
sacrifice
i
think
i
laughed
aloud
i
remembered
the
man
i
had
pursued
my
first
night
in
virginia
the
man
who
had
raided
frew
cabin
i
remembered
tale
of
the
scots
redemptioner
that
had
escaped
from
norfolk
county
and
the
various
strange
writings
which
had
descended
from
the
hills
was
it
not
the
queerest
fate
that
one
whom
i
had
met
in
my
boyish
scrapes
should
return
after
six
years
and
many
thousand
miles
to
play
once
more
a
major
part
in
my
life
the
nameless
general
in
the
hills
was
muckle
john
gib
once
a
mariner
of
borrowstoneness
and
some
time
leader
of
the
i
felt
the
smell
of
wet
heather
and
the
fishy
odours
of
the
forth
i
heard
the
tang
of
our
country
speech
and
the
swirl
of
the
gusty
winds
of
home
but
in
a
second
all
thought
of
mirth
was
gone
and
a
deep
solemnity
fell
upon
me
god
had
assuredly
directed
my
path
for
he
had
brought
the
two
of
us
together
over
the
widest
spaces
of
earth
i
had
no
fear
of
the
issue
i
should
master
muckle
john
as
i
had
mastered
him
before
my
awe
was
all
for
god
mysterious
dealing
not
for
that
poor
fool
posturing
behind
his
obscene
sacrifice
his
voice
rose
and
fell
in
eldritch
screams
and
hollow
moans
he
was
mouthing
the
words
of
some
bible
prophet
sword
is
upon
her
horses
and
upon
her
chariots
and
upon
all
the
mingled
people
that
are
in
the
midst
of
her
and
they
shall
become
as
women
a
sword
is
upon
her
treasures
and
they
shall
be
robbed
a
drought
is
upon
her
waters
and
they
shall
be
dried
up
for
it
is
the
land
of
graven
images
and
they
are
mad
upon
their
every
syllable
brought
back
some
memory
he
had
the
whine
and
sough
in
his
voice
that
our
sectaries
prized
and
i
could
shut
my
eyes
and
imagine
i
was
back
in
the
little
kirk
of
lesmahagow
on
a
hot
summer
morn
and
then
would
come
the
scream
of
madness
the
high
wail
of
the
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
bring
a
king
of
kings
from
the
north
with
horses
and
with
chariots
and
with
horsemen
and
companies
and
muck
people
he
shall
slay
with
the
sword
thy
daughters
in
the
fine
words
i
thought
but
elspeth
laid
her
whip
over
your
shoulders
my
man
the
hoofs
of
his
horses
shall
he
tread
down
all
thy
streets
he
shall
slay
thy
people
by
the
sword
and
thy
strong
garrisons
shall
go
down
to
the
ground
and
i
will
cause
the
music
of
thy
songs
to
cease
and
the
sound
of
thy
harps
shall
no
more
be
heard
i
had
a
vision
of
elspeth
birthday
party
when
we
sat
round
the
governor
table
and
i
had
wondered
dismally
how
long
it
would
be
before
our
pleasant
songs
would
be
turned
to
mourning
the
fires
died
down
the
smoke
thinned
and
the
full
moon
rising
over
the
crest
of
the
hills
poured
her
light
on
us
the
torches
flickered
insolently
in
that
calm
radiance
the
voice
too
grew
lower
and
the
incantation
ceased
then
it
began
again
in
the
indian
tongue
and
the
whole
host
rose
to
their
feet
muckle
john
like
some
old
priest
of
diana
flung
up
his
arms
to
the
heavens
and
seemed
to
be
invoking
his
strange
gods
or
he
may
have
been
blessing
his
flock
i
know
not
which
then
he
turned
and
strode
back
to
his
tent
just
as
he
had
done
on
that
night
in
the
cauldstaneslap
a
hand
was
laid
on
my
arm
and
onotawah
stood
by
me
he
motioned
me
to
follow
him
and
led
me
past
the
smoking
altar
to
a
row
of
painted
white
stones
around
the
great
wigwam
this
he
did
not
cross
but
pointed
to
the
tent
door
i
pushed
aside
the
flap
and
entered
an
indian
lamp
a
wick
floating
in
oil
stood
on
a
rough
table
but
its
thin
light
was
unneeded
for
the
great
flood
of
moonshine
coming
through
the
slits
of
the
skins
made
a
clear
yellow
twilight
by
it
i
marked
the
figure
of
muckle
john
on
his
knees
good
evening
to
you
gib
i
said
the
figure
sprang
to
its
feet
and
strode
over
to
me
who
are
ye
it
cried
who
speaks
a
name
that
is
no
more
spoken
on
earth
just
a
countryman
of
yours
who
has
forgathered
with
you
before
have
you
no
mind
of
the
cauldstaneslap
and
the
canongate
tolbooth
he
snatched
up
the
lamp
and
peered
into
my
face
but
he
was
long
past
recollection
i
know
ye
not
but
if
ye
be
indeed
one
from
that
idolatrous
country
of
scotland
the
lord
hath
sent
you
to
witness
the
triumph
of
his
servant
know
that
i
am
no
longer
the
man
john
gib
but
the
chosen
of
the
lord
to
whom
he
hath
given
a
new
name
even
jerubbaal
saying
let
baal
plead
against
him
because
he
hath
thrown
down
his
altar
that
too
long
a
word
for
me
to
remember
gib
so
by
your
leave
i
call
you
as
you
were
christened
i
had
forced
myself
to
a
slow
coolness
and
my
voice
seemed
to
madden
him
ye
would
outface
me
he
cried
i
see
ye
are
an
idolater
from
the
tents
of
shem
on
whom
judgment
will
be
speedy
and
surprising
know
ye
not
what
the
lord
hath
prepared
for
ye
down
in
your
proud
cities
ye
are
feasting
and
dicing
and
smiling
on
your
paramours
but
the
writing
is
on
the
wall
and
in
a
little
ye
will
be
crying
like
weaned
bairns
for
a
refuge
against
the
storm
of
god
your
strong
men
shall
be
slain
and
your
virgins
shall
be
led
captive
and
your
little
children
shall
be
dashed
against
a
stone
and
in
the
midst
of
your
ruins
i
even
i
will
raise
a
temple
to
the
god
of
israel
and
nations
that
know
me
not
will
run
unto
me
because
of
the
lord
my
god
i
had
determined
on
my
part
and
played
it
calmly
and
what
will
you
do
with
your
indian
braves
i
asked
sharon
shall
be
a
fold
of
flocks
and
the
valley
of
achor
a
place
to
lie
down
in
for
my
people
that
have
sought
me
he
answered
a
bonny
spectacle
i
said
man
if
you
dare
to
cross
the
border
you
will
be
whipped
at
a
and
clapped
into
bedlam
as
a
crazy
vagabond
blasphemer
he
shrieked
and
ran
at
me
with
the
knife
he
had
used
on
the
panther
it
took
all
my
courage
to
play
my
game
i
stood
motionless
looking
at
him
and
his
head
fell
had
i
moved
he
would
have
struck
but
to
his
mad
eyes
my
calmness
was
terrifying
it
sticks
in
my
mind
i
said
that
there
is
a
commandment
do
no
murder
you
call
yourself
a
follower
of
the
lord
let
me
tell
you
that
you
are
no
more
than
a
savage
a
thousandfold
more
guilty
than
those
poor
creatures
you
are
leading
astray
you
serve
baal
not
god
john
gib
and
the
devil
in
hell
is
banking
his
fires
and
counting
on
your
company
he
gibbered
at
me
like
a
bedlamite
but
i
knew
what
i
was
doing
i
raised
my
voice
and
spoke
loud
and
clear
while
my
eyes
held
his
in
that
yellow
dusk
priest
of
baal
i
cried
lying
prophet
go
down
on
your
knees
and
pray
for
mercy
by
the
living
god
the
flames
of
hell
are
waiting
for
you
the
lightnings
tremble
in
the
clouds
to
scorch
you
up
and
send
your
black
soul
to
its
own
place
his
hands
pawed
at
my
throat
but
the
horror
was
descending
on
him
he
shrieked
like
a
wild
beast
and
cast
fearful
eyes
behind
him
then
he
rushed
into
the
dark
corners
stabbing
with
his
knife
crying
that
the
devils
were
loosed
i
remember
how
horribly
he
frothed
at
the
mouth
avaunt
he
howled
avaunt
mel
and
abaddon
avaunt
and
ha
there
i
had
ye
ye
muckle
goat
the
stink
of
hell
is
on
ye
but
ye
shall
not
take
the
elect
of
the
lord
he
crawled
on
his
belly
stabbing
his
knife
into
the
ground
i
easily
avoided
him
for
his
eyes
saw
nothing
but
his
terrible
phantoms
verily
shalah
had
spoken
truth
when
he
said
that
this
man
had
bodily
converse
with
the
devils
then
i
threw
him
quite
easily
for
his
limbs
were
going
limp
in
the
extremity
of
his
horror
he
lay
gasping
and
foaming
his
eyes
turning
back
in
his
head
while
i
bound
his
arms
to
his
sides
with
my
belt
i
found
some
cords
in
the
tent
and
tied
his
legs
together
he
moaned
miserably
for
a
little
and
then
was
silent
i
think
i
must
have
sat
by
him
for
three
hours
the
world
was
very
still
and
the
moon
set
and
the
only
light
was
the
flickering
lamp
once
or
twice
i
heard
a
rustle
by
the
tent
door
some
indian
guard
was
on
the
watch
but
i
knew
that
no
indian
dared
to
cross
the
forbidden
circle
i
had
no
thoughts
being
oppressed
with
a
great
stupor
of
weariness
i
may
have
dozed
a
little
but
the
pain
of
my
legs
kept
me
from
slumbering
once
or
twice
i
looked
at
him
and
i
noticed
that
the
madness
had
gone
out
of
his
face
and
that
he
was
sleeping
peacefully
i
wiped
the
froth
from
his
lips
and
his
forehead
was
cool
to
my
touch
by
and
by
as
i
held
the
lamp
close
i
observed
that
his
eyes
were
open
it
was
now
time
for
the
gamble
i
had
resolved
on
i
remembered
that
morning
in
the
tolbooth
and
how
the
madness
had
passed
leaving
him
a
simple
soul
i
unstrapped
the
belt
and
cut
the
cords
about
his
legs
do
you
feel
better
now
mr
gib
i
asked
as
if
it
were
the
most
ordinary
question
in
the
world
he
sat
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
was
it
a
dwam
he
inquired
i
get
them
whiles
it
was
a
dwam
but
i
think
it
has
passed
he
still
rubbed
his
eyes
and
peered
about
him
like
a
big
collie
dog
that
has
lost
its
master
who
is
it
that
speirs
he
said
i
ken
the
voice
but
i
havena
heard
it
this
long
time
one
who
is
well
acquaint
with
borrowstoneness
and
the
links
of
forth
said
i
spoke
in
the
accent
of
his
own
and
it
must
have
woke
some
dim
chord
in
his
memory
i
made
haste
to
strike
while
the
iron
was
hot
there
was
a
woman
at
cramond
i
began
he
got
to
his
feet
and
looked
me
in
the
face
ay
there
was
he
said
with
an
odd
note
in
his
voice
what
about
her
i
could
see
that
his
hand
was
shaking
i
think
her
name
was
alison
steel
what
ken
ye
of
alison
steel
he
asked
fiercely
quick
man
what
word
have
ye
frae
alison
you
sent
me
with
a
letter
to
her
not
mind
your
last
days
in
edinburgh
before
they
shipped
you
to
the
plantations
it
comes
back
to
me
he
cried
ay
it
comes
back
to
think
i
should
live
to
hear
of
alison
what
did
she
say
just
this
that
john
gib
was
a
decent
man
if
he
would
resist
the
devil
of
pride
she
charged
me
to
tell
you
that
you
would
never
be
out
of
her
prayers
and
that
she
would
live
to
be
proud
of
you
will
never
shame
his
kin
quoth
she
said
she
so
he
said
musingly
she
was
aye
a
kind
body
we
were
to
be
married
at
martinmas
i
mind
if
the
lord
hadna
called
me
you
need
of
her
prayers
i
said
and
of
the
prayers
of
every
christian
soul
on
earth
i
came
here
yestereen
to
find
you
mouthing
blasphemies
and
howling
like
a
mad
tyke
amid
a
parcel
of
heathen
and
they
tell
me
you
to
lead
your
savages
on
virginia
and
give
that
smiling
land
to
fire
and
sword
think
you
alison
steel
would
not
be
black
ashamed
if
she
heard
the
horrid
tale
was
the
lord
commands
he
said
gloomily
but
there
was
no
conviction
in
his
words
i
changed
my
tone
do
you
dare
to
speak
such
blasphemy
i
cried
the
lord
commands
the
devil
commands
the
devil
of
your
own
sinful
pride
you
are
like
the
false
prophets
that
made
israel
to
sin
what
brings
you
a
white
man
at
the
head
of
murderous
savages
israel
would
not
hearken
so
i
turned
to
the
gentiles
said
he
and
what
are
you
going
to
make
of
your
gentiles
do
you
think
put
much
christianity
into
the
heart
of
the
gentry
that
were
watching
your
antics
last
night
they
have
glimmerings
of
grace
he
said
glimmerings
of
moonshine
they
are
bent
on
murder
and
so
are
you
and
you
call
that
the
lord
commands
you
would
sacrifice
your
own
folk
to
the
heathen
hordes
god
forgive
you
john
gib
for
you
are
no
christian
and
no
scot
and
no
man
virginia
is
an
idolatrous
land
said
he
but
he
could
not
look
up
at
me
and
are
your
indians
not
idolaters
are
you
no
idolater
with
your
burnt
offerings
and
heathen
gibberish
you
worship
a
baal
and
a
moloch
worse
than
any
midianite
for
you
adore
the
devils
of
your
own
rotten
heart
the
big
man
with
all
the
madness
out
of
him
put
his
towsy
head
in
his
hands
and
a
sob
shook
his
great
shoulders
listen
to
me
john
gib
i
am
come
from
your
own
to
save
you
from
a
hellish
wickedness
i
know
the
length
and
breadth
of
virginia
and
the
land
is
full
of
scots
men
of
the
covenant
you
have
forsworn
who
are
living
an
honest
life
on
their
bits
of
farms
and
worshipping
the
god
you
have
forsaken
there
are
women
there
like
alison
steel
and
there
are
men
there
like
yourself
before
you
hearkened
to
the
devil
will
you
bring
death
to
your
own
folk
with
whom
you
once
shared
the
hope
of
salvation
by
the
land
we
both
have
left
and
the
kindly
souls
we
both
have
known
and
the
prayers
you
said
at
your
mother
knee
and
the
love
of
christ
who
died
for
us
i
adjure
you
to
flee
this
great
sin
for
it
is
the
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
and
that
knows
no
forgiveness
the
man
was
fairly
broken
down
what
must
i
do
he
cried
i
all
in
a
creel
i
but
a
pipe
for
the
lord
to
sound
through
take
not
that
name
in
vain
for
the
sounding
is
from
your
own
corrupt
heart
mind
what
alison
steel
said
about
the
devil
of
pride
for
it
was
that
sin
by
which
the
angels
fell
but
i
his
plain
commands
he
wailed
he
hath
bidden
me
cast
down
idolatry
and
bring
the
gentiles
to
his
kingdom
did
he
say
anything
about
virginia
there
plenty
idolatry
elsewhere
in
america
to
keep
you
busy
for
a
lifetime
and
you
can
lead
your
gentiles
elsewhere
than
against
your
own
kin
turn
your
face
westward
john
gib
i
too
can
dream
dreams
and
see
visions
and
it
is
borne
in
on
me
that
your
road
is
plain
before
you
lead
this
great
people
away
from
the
little
shielings
of
virginia
over
the
hills
and
over
the
great
mountains
and
the
plains
beyond
and
on
and
on
till
you
come
to
an
abiding
city
you
will
find
idolaters
enough
to
dispute
your
road
and
you
can
guide
your
flock
as
the
lord
directs
you
then
you
will
be
clear
of
the
murderer
guilt
who
would
stain
his
hands
in
kindly
blood
he
lifted
his
great
head
and
the
marks
of
the
sacrifice
were
still
on
his
brow
d
think
that
would
be
the
lord
will
he
asked
innocently
i
declare
it
unto
you
said
i
i
have
been
sent
by
god
to
save
your
soul
i
give
you
your
marching
orders
for
though
you
are
half
a
madman
you
are
whiles
a
man
there
the
soul
of
a
leader
in
you
and
i
would
keep
you
from
the
shame
of
leading
men
to
hell
morn
you
will
tell
these
folk
that
the
lord
has
revealed
to
you
a
better
way
and
by
noon
you
will
be
across
the
shenandoah
hear
my
word
ay
he
said
we
will
march
in
the
morning
can
you
lead
them
where
you
will
his
back
stiffened
and
the
spirit
of
a
general
looked
out
of
his
eyes
they
will
follow
where
i
bid
there
no
a
man
of
them
dare
cheep
at
what
i
tell
them
my
work
is
done
i
said
i
go
to
whence
i
came
and
some
day
i
shall
go
to
cramond
and
tell
alison
that
john
gib
is
no
disgrace
to
his
kin
would
you
put
up
a
prayer
he
said
timidly
i
would
be
the
better
of
one
then
for
the
first
and
last
time
in
my
life
i
spoke
aloud
to
my
maker
in
another
presence
and
it
was
surely
the
strangest
petition
ever
offered
lord
i
prayed
thou
seest
thy
creature
john
gib
who
by
the
perverseness
of
his
heart
has
come
to
the
edge
of
grievous
sin
take
the
cloud
from
his
spirit
arrange
his
disordered
wits
and
lead
him
to
a
wiser
life
keep
him
in
mind
of
his
own
land
and
of
her
who
prays
for
him
guide
him
over
hills
and
rivers
to
an
enlarged
country
and
make
his
arm
strong
against
his
enemies
so
be
they
are
not
of
his
own
kin
and
if
ever
he
should
hearken
again
to
the
devil
do
thou
blast
his
body
with
thy
fires
so
that
his
soul
may
be
saved
amen
said
he
and
i
went
out
of
the
tent
to
find
the
grey
dawn
beginning
to
steal
up
the
sky
shalah
was
waiting
at
the
entrance
far
inside
the
white
stones
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
seen
him
in
a
state
approaching
fear
what
fortune
brother
he
asked
and
his
teeth
chattered
the
tidewater
is
safe
this
day
they
march
westwards
to
look
for
their
new
country
thy
magic
is
as
the
magic
of
heaven
he
said
reverently
my
heart
all
night
has
been
like
water
for
i
know
no
charm
which
hath
prevailed
against
the
mystery
of
the
panther
was
no
magic
of
mine
said
i
god
spoke
to
him
through
my
lips
in
the
night
watches
we
took
our
way
unchallenged
through
the
sleeping
host
till
we
had
climbed
the
scarp
of
the
hills
what
brought
you
to
the
tent
door
i
asked
i
abode
there
through
the
night
i
heard
the
strife
with
the
devils
and
my
joints
were
loosened
also
i
heard
thy
voice
brother
but
i
knew
not
thy
words
but
what
did
you
mean
to
do
i
asked
again
it
was
in
my
mind
to
do
my
little
best
to
see
that
no
harm
befell
thee
and
if
harm
came
i
had
the
thought
of
trying
my
knife
on
the
ribs
of
yonder
magician
chapter
xxviii
how
three
souls
found
their
heritage
in
that
hour
i
had
none
of
the
exhilaration
of
success
so
strangely
are
we
mortals
made
that
though
i
had
won
safety
for
myself
and
my
people
i
could
not
get
the
savour
of
it
i
had
passed
too
far
beyond
the
limits
of
my
strength
now
that
the
tension
of
peril
was
gone
my
legs
were
like
touchwood
which
a
stroke
would
shatter
and
my
foolish
head
swam
like
a
shalah
arm
was
round
me
and
he
lifted
me
up
the
steep
bits
till
we
came
to
the
crown
of
the
ridge
there
we
halted
and
he
fed
me
with
sops
of
bread
dipped
in
for
he
had
brought
ringan
flask
with
him
the
only
result
was
to
make
me
deadly
sick
i
saw
his
eyes
look
gravely
at
me
and
the
next
i
knew
i
was
on
his
back
i
begged
him
to
set
me
down
and
leave
me
and
i
think
i
must
have
wept
like
a
bairn
all
pride
of
manhood
had
flown
in
that
sharp
revulsion
and
i
had
the
mind
of
a
lost
child
as
the
light
grew
some
strength
came
back
to
me
and
presently
i
was
able
to
hobble
a
little
on
my
rickety
shanks
we
kept
the
very
crest
of
the
range
and
came
by
and
by
to
a
promontory
of
clear
ground
the
same
i
fancy
from
which
i
had
first
seen
the
vale
of
the
shenandoah
there
we
rested
in
a
nook
of
rock
while
the
early
sun
warmed
us
and
the
little
vapours
showed
us
in
glimpses
the
green
depths
and
the
meadows
shalah
nudged
my
shoulder
and
pointed
to
the
south
where
a
glen
debouched
from
the
hills
a
stream
of
mounted
figures
was
pouring
out
of
it
heading
for
the
upper
waters
of
the
river
where
the
valley
broadened
again
for
all
my
sickness
my
eyes
were
sharp
enough
to
perceive
what
manner
of
procession
it
was
all
were
on
horseback
riding
in
clouds
and
companies
without
the
discipline
of
a
march
but
moving
as
swift
as
a
flight
of
wildfowl
at
twilight
before
the
others
rode
a
little
cluster
of
pathfinders
and
among
them
i
thought
i
could
recognize
one
taller
than
the
rest
your
magic
hath
prevailed
brother
shalah
said
in
an
hour
time
they
will
have
crossed
the
shenandoah
and
at
nightfall
they
will
camp
on
the
farther
mountains
that
sight
gave
me
my
first
assurance
of
success
at
any
rate
i
had
fulfilled
my
trust
and
if
i
died
in
the
hills
virginia
would
yet
bless
her
deliverer
and
yet
my
strongest
feeling
was
a
wild
regret
these
folk
were
making
for
the
untravelled
lands
of
the
sunset
you
would
have
said
i
had
got
my
bellyful
of
adventure
and
should
now
have
sought
only
a
quiet
life
but
in
that
moment
of
bodily
weakness
and
mental
confusion
i
was
shaken
with
a
longing
to
follow
them
to
find
what
lay
beyond
the
farthest
mountain
to
cross
the
wide
rivers
and
haply
to
come
to
the
infinite
and
mystic
ocean
of
the
west
would
to
god
i
were
with
them
i
sighed
will
you
come
brother
shalah
whispered
a
strange
light
in
his
eyes
if
we
twain
joined
the
venture
i
think
we
should
not
be
the
last
in
it
shalah
would
make
you
a
king
what
is
your
life
in
the
muddy
tidewater
but
a
thing
of
little
rivalries
and
petty
wrangles
and
moping
over
paper
the
hearth
will
soon
grow
cold
and
the
bright
eyes
of
the
fairest
woman
will
dull
with
age
and
the
years
will
find
you
heavy
and
slow
with
a
coward
shrinking
from
death
what
say
you
brother
while
the
blood
is
strong
in
the
veins
shall
we
ride
westward
on
the
path
of
a
king
his
eyes
were
staring
like
a
hawk
over
the
hills
and
as
i
was
i
caught
the
infection
of
his
ardour
for
remember
i
was
so
low
in
spirit
that
all
my
hopes
and
memories
were
forgotten
and
i
was
in
that
blank
apathy
which
is
mastered
by
another
passion
for
a
little
the
life
of
virginia
seemed
unspeakably
barren
and
i
quickened
at
the
wild
vista
which
shalah
offered
i
might
be
a
king
over
a
proud
people
carving
a
fair
kingdom
out
of
the
wilderness
and
ruling
it
justly
in
the
fear
of
god
these
western
indians
were
the
stuff
of
a
great
nation
i
andrew
garvald
might
yet
find
that
empire
of
which
the
old
adventurers
dreamed
with
shame
i
set
down
my
boyish
folly
it
did
not
last
long
for
to
my
dizzy
brain
there
came
the
air
which
elspeth
had
sung
that
song
of
montrose
which
had
been
as
it
were
the
star
of
all
my
wanderings
for
if
confusion
have
a
part
which
virtuous
souls
abhor
surely
it
was
confusion
that
had
now
overtaken
me
elspeth
clear
voice
her
dark
kind
eyes
her
young
and
joyous
grace
filled
again
my
memory
was
not
such
a
lady
better
than
any
savage
kingdom
was
not
the
service
of
my
own
folk
nobler
than
any
principate
among
strangers
could
the
rivers
of
damascus
vie
with
the
waters
of
israel
nay
shalah
i
said
mine
is
a
quieter
destiny
i
go
back
to
the
tidewater
but
i
shall
not
stay
there
we
have
found
the
road
to
the
hills
and
in
time
i
will
plant
the
flag
of
my
race
on
the
shenandoah
he
bowed
his
head
so
be
it
each
man
to
his
own
path
but
i
would
ours
had
run
together
your
way
is
the
way
of
the
white
man
you
conquer
slowly
but
the
line
of
your
conquest
goes
not
back
slowly
it
eats
its
way
through
the
forest
and
fields
and
manors
appear
in
the
waste
places
and
cattle
graze
in
the
coverts
of
the
deer
listen
brother
shalah
has
had
his
visions
when
his
eyes
were
unsealed
in
the
night
watches
he
has
seen
the
white
man
pressing
up
from
the
sea
and
spreading
over
the
lands
of
his
fathers
he
has
seen
the
glens
of
the
hills
parcelled
out
like
the
meadows
of
henricus
and
a
great
multitude
surging
ever
on
to
the
west
his
race
is
doomed
by
god
to
perish
before
the
stranger
but
not
yet
awhile
for
the
white
man
comes
slowly
it
hath
been
told
that
the
children
of
the
west
wind
must
seek
their
cradle
and
while
there
is
time
he
would
join
them
in
that
quest
the
white
men
follow
upon
their
heels
but
in
his
day
and
in
that
of
his
son
sons
they
will
lead
their
life
according
to
the
ancient
ways
he
hath
seen
the
wisdom
of
the
stranger
and
found
among
them
men
after
his
own
heart
but
the
spirit
of
his
fathers
calls
and
now
he
returns
to
his
own
people
what
will
you
do
there
i
asked
i
know
not
i
am
still
a
prince
among
them
and
will
sway
their
councils
it
may
be
fated
that
i
slay
yonder
magician
and
reign
in
his
stead
he
got
to
his
feet
and
looked
proudly
westward
in
a
little
i
shall
overtake
them
but
i
would
my
brother
had
been
of
my
company
slowly
we
travelled
north
along
the
crests
for
though
my
mind
was
now
saner
i
had
no
strength
in
my
body
the
hill
mists
came
down
on
us
and
the
rain
drove
up
from
the
glens
i
was
happy
now
for
all
my
weakness
for
i
was
lapped
in
a
great
peace
the
raw
weather
which
had
once
been
a
horror
of
darkness
to
me
was
now
something
kindly
and
homelike
the
wet
smells
minded
me
of
my
own
land
and
the
cool
buffets
of
the
squalls
were
a
tonic
to
my
spirit
i
wandered
into
pleasant
dreams
and
scarce
felt
the
roughness
of
the
ground
on
my
bare
feet
and
the
aches
in
every
limb
long
ere
we
got
to
the
gap
i
was
clean
worn
out
i
remember
that
i
fell
constantly
and
could
scarcely
rise
then
i
stumbled
and
the
last
power
went
out
of
will
and
sinew
i
had
a
glimpse
of
shalah
grave
face
as
i
slipped
into
unconsciousness
i
woke
in
a
glow
of
firelight
faces
surrounded
me
dim
figures
still
entangled
in
the
meshes
of
my
dreams
slowly
the
scene
cleared
and
i
recognized
grey
features
drawn
and
constrained
and
yet
welcoming
bertrand
was
weeping
after
his
excitable
fashion
but
there
was
a
face
nearer
to
me
and
with
that
face
in
my
memory
i
went
off
into
pleasant
dreams
somewhere
in
them
mingled
the
words
of
the
old
spaewife
that
i
should
miss
love
and
fortune
in
the
sunshine
and
find
them
in
the
rain
the
strength
of
youth
is
like
a
branch
of
yew
for
if
it
is
bent
it
soon
straightens
by
the
third
day
i
was
on
my
feet
again
with
only
the
stiffness
of
healing
wounds
to
remind
me
of
those
desperate
passages
when
i
could
look
about
me
i
found
that
men
had
arrived
from
the
rappahannock
and
among
them
elspeth
uncle
who
had
girded
on
a
great
claymore
and
looked
for
all
his
worn
face
and
sober
habit
a
mighty
man
of
war
with
them
came
news
of
the
rout
of
the
cherokees
who
had
been
beaten
by
nicholson
militia
in
stafford
county
and
driven
down
the
long
line
of
the
border
paying
toll
to
every
stockade
midway
lawrence
had
fallen
upon
them
and
driven
the
remnants
into
the
hills
above
the
head
waters
of
the
james
it
would
be
many
a
day
i
thought
before
these
gentry
would
bring
war
again
to
the
tidewater
the
rappahannock
men
were
in
high
feather
convinced
that
they
had
borne
the
brunt
of
the
invasion
was
no
business
of
mine
to
enlighten
them
the
more
since
of
the
three
who
knew
the
full
peril
shalah
was
gone
and
ringan
was
dead
my
tale
should
be
for
the
ear
of
lawrence
and
the
governor
and
for
none
else
the
peace
of
mind
of
virginia
should
not
be
broken
by
me
grey
came
to
me
on
the
third
morning
to
say
he
was
going
back
to
the
tidewater
with
some
of
the
borderers
for
to
stay
longer
with
us
had
become
a
torture
to
him
there
was
no
ill
feeling
in
his
proud
soul
and
he
bore
defeat
as
a
gentleman
should
you
have
fairly
won
garvald
he
said
three
nights
ago
i
saw
clearly
revealed
the
inclination
of
the
lady
and
i
am
not
one
to
strive
with
an
unwilling
maid
i
wish
you
joy
of
a
great
prize
you
staked
high
for
it
and
you
deserve
your
fortune
as
for
me
you
have
taught
me
much
for
which
i
owe
you
gratitude
presently
when
my
heart
is
less
sore
i
desire
that
we
should
meet
in
friendship
but
till
then
i
need
a
little
solitude
to
mend
broken
threads
there
was
the
true
gentleman
for
you
and
i
sorrowed
that
i
should
ever
have
misjudged
him
he
shook
my
hand
in
all
brotherliness
and
went
down
the
glen
with
bertrand
who
longed
to
see
his
children
again
elspeth
remained
and
concerning
her
i
fell
into
my
old
doubting
mood
the
return
of
my
strength
had
revived
in
me
the
passion
which
had
dwelt
somewhere
in
my
soul
from
the
hour
she
first
sang
to
me
in
the
rain
she
had
greeted
me
as
girl
greets
her
lover
but
was
that
any
more
than
the
revulsion
from
fear
and
the
pity
of
a
tender
heart
doubts
oppressed
me
the
more
as
she
seemed
constrained
and
uneasy
her
eyes
falling
when
she
met
mine
and
her
voice
full
no
longer
of
its
frank
comradeship
one
afternoon
we
went
to
a
place
in
the
hills
where
the
vale
of
the
shenandoah
could
be
seen
the
rain
had
gone
and
had
left
behind
it
a
taste
of
autumn
the
hill
berries
were
ripening
and
a
touch
of
flame
had
fallen
on
the
thickets
soon
the
great
valley
lay
below
us
running
out
in
a
golden
haze
to
the
far
blue
mountains
ah
she
sighed
like
one
who
comes
from
a
winter
night
into
a
firelit
room
she
was
silent
while
her
eyes
drank
in
its
spacious
comfort
that
is
your
heritage
elspeth
that
is
the
birthday
gift
to
which
old
studd
is
the
key
nay
yours
she
said
for
you
won
it
the
words
died
on
her
lips
for
her
eyes
were
abstracted
my
legs
were
still
feeble
and
i
had
leaned
a
little
on
her
strong
young
arm
as
we
came
up
the
hill
but
now
she
left
me
and
climbed
on
a
rock
where
she
sat
like
a
pixie
the
hardships
of
the
past
had
thinned
her
face
and
deepened
her
eyes
but
her
grace
was
the
more
manifest
fresh
and
dewy
as
morning
yet
with
a
soul
of
steel
and
fire
surely
no
lovelier
nymph
ever
graced
a
woodland
i
felt
how
rough
and
common
was
my
own
clay
in
contrast
with
her
bright
spirit
elspeth
i
said
hoarsely
once
i
told
you
what
was
in
my
heart
her
face
grew
grave
and
have
you
not
seen
what
is
in
mine
she
asked
i
have
seen
and
rejoiced
and
yet
i
doubt
but
why
she
asked
again
my
life
is
yours
for
you
have
preserved
it
i
would
be
graceless
indeed
if
i
did
not
give
my
best
to
you
who
have
given
all
for
me
it
is
not
gratitude
i
want
if
you
are
only
grateful
put
me
out
of
your
thoughts
and
i
will
go
away
and
strive
to
forget
you
there
were
twenty
in
the
tidewater
who
would
have
done
the
like
she
looked
down
on
me
from
the
rock
with
the
old
quizzing
humour
in
her
eyes
if
gratitude
irks
you
sir
what
would
you
have
all
i
cried
and
yet
heaven
knows
i
am
not
worth
it
i
am
no
man
to
capture
a
fair
girl
heart
my
face
is
rude
and
my
speech
harsh
and
i
am
damnably
prosaic
i
have
not
ringan
fancy
or
gallantry
i
am
sober
and
and
uncouth
and
my
mind
runs
terribly
on
facts
and
figures
o
elspeth
i
know
i
am
no
hero
of
romance
but
a
plain
body
whom
fate
has
forced
into
a
month
of
wildness
i
shall
go
back
to
virginia
and
be
set
once
more
at
my
accompts
and
ladings
think
well
my
dear
for
i
will
have
nothing
less
than
all
can
you
endure
to
spend
your
days
with
a
homely
fellow
like
me
what
does
a
woman
desire
she
asked
as
if
from
herself
and
her
voice
was
very
soft
as
she
gazed
over
the
valley
men
think
it
is
a
handsome
face
or
a
brisk
air
or
a
smooth
tongue
and
some
will
have
it
that
it
is
a
deep
purse
or
a
high
station
but
i
think
it
is
the
honest
heart
that
goes
all
the
way
with
a
woman
love
we
are
not
so
blind
as
to
believe
that
the
glitter
is
the
gold
we
love
romance
but
we
seek
it
in
its
true
home
do
you
think
i
would
marry
you
for
gratitude
andrew
no
i
said
or
for
admiration
no
said
i
or
for
love
yes
i
said
with
a
sudden
joy
she
slipped
from
the
rock
her
eyes
soft
and
misty
her
arms
were
about
my
neck
and
i
heard
from
her
the
words
i
had
dreamed
of
and
yet
scarce
hoped
for
the
words
of
the
song
sung
long
ago
to
a
boy
ear
and
spoken
now
with
the
pure
fervour
of
the
heart
my
dear
and
only
love
years
have
flown
since
that
day
on
the
hills
and
much
has
befallen
but
the
prologue
is
the
kernel
of
my
play
and
the
curtain
which
rose
after
that
hour
revealed
things
less
worthy
of
chronicle
why
should
i
tell
of
how
my
trade
prospered
mightily
and
of
the
great
house
we
built
at
middle
plantation
of
my
quarrels
with
nicholson
which
were
many
of
how
we
carved
a
fair
estate
out
of
elspeth
inheritance
and
led
the
tide
of
settlement
to
the
edge
of
the
hills
these
things
would
seem
a
pedestrian
end
to
a
high
beginning
nor
would
i
weary
the
reader
with
my
doings
in
the
assembly
how
i
bearded
more
governors
than
one
and
disputed
stoutly
with
his
majesty
privy
council
in
london
the
historian
of
virginia
now
by
god
grace
a
notable
land
may
perhaps
take
note
of
these
things
but
it
is
well
for
me
to
keep
silent
it
is
of
youth
alone
that
i
am
concerned
to
write
for
it
is
a
comfort
to
my
soul
to
know
that
once
in
my
decorous
progress
through
life
i
could
kick
my
heels
and
forget
to
count
the
cost
and
as
youth
cries
farewell
so
i
end
my
story
and
turn
to
my
accounts
elspeth
and
i
have
twice
voyaged
to
scotland
the
first
time
my
uncle
and
mother
were
still
in
the
land
of
the
living
but
they
died
in
the
same
year
and
on
our
second
journey
i
had
much
ado
in
settling
their
estates
my
riches
being
now
considerable
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
little
house
of
auchencairn
which
i
enlarged
and
beautified
so
that
if
we
have
the
wish
we
may
take
up
our
dwelling
there
we
have
found
in
the
west
a
goodly
heritage
but
there
is
that
in
a
man
birth
place
which
keeps
tight
fingers
on
his
soul
and
i
think
that
we
desire
to
draw
our
last
breath
and
lay
our
bones
in
our
own
grey
so
if
god
grants
us
length
of
days
we
may
haply
return
to
douglasdale
in
the
even
and
instead
of
our
noble
forests
and
rich
meadows
look
upon
the
bleak
mosses
and
the
rainy
uplands
which
were
our
memory
that
is
the
fancy
at
the
back
of
both
our
heads
but
i
am
very
sure
that
our
sons
will
be
virginians
the
end
