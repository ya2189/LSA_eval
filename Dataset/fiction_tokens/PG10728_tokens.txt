chapter
i
runswick
bay
it
was
the
yellow
ragwort
that
did
it
i
have
discovered
the
clue
at
last
all
night
long
i
have
been
dreaming
of
runswick
bay
i
have
been
climbing
the
rocks
talking
to
the
fishermen
picking
my
way
over
the
masses
of
slippery
seaweed
and
breathing
the
fresh
briny
air
and
all
the
morning
i
have
been
saying
to
myself
can
have
made
me
dream
of
runswick
bay
what
can
have
brought
the
events
of
my
short
stay
in
that
quaint
little
place
so
vividly
before
me
yes
i
am
convinced
of
it
it
was
that
bunch
of
yellow
ragwort
on
the
mantelpiece
in
my
bedroom
my
little
ella
gathered
it
in
the
lane
behind
the
house
yesterday
morning
and
brought
it
in
triumphantly
and
seized
the
best
china
vase
in
the
and
filled
it
with
water
at
the
tap
and
thrust
the
great
yellow
bunch
into
it
ella
said
florence
her
elder
sister
ugly
common
flowers
how
could
you
put
them
in
mother
best
vase
that
aunt
alice
gave
her
on
her
birthday
what
a
silly
child
you
are
not
a
silly
child
aid
ella
stoutly
mother
is
sure
to
like
them
i
know
she
will
wo
call
them
common
flowers
she
loves
all
yellow
flowers
she
said
so
when
i
brought
her
the
daffodils
and
these
are
yellower
ever
so
much
yellower
her
mother
came
in
at
this
moment
and
taking
our
little
girl
on
her
knee
she
told
her
that
she
was
quite
right
they
were
very
beautiful
in
her
eyes
and
she
would
put
them
at
once
in
her
own
room
where
she
could
have
them
all
to
herself
and
that
is
how
it
came
about
that
as
i
lay
in
bed
the
last
thing
my
eyes
fell
upon
was
ella
bunch
of
yellow
ragwort
and
what
could
be
more
natural
than
that
i
should
go
to
sleep
and
dream
of
runswick
bay
it
seems
only
yesterday
that
i
was
there
so
clearly
can
i
recall
it
and
yet
it
must
be
twenty
years
ago
i
think
i
must
write
an
account
of
my
visit
to
runswick
bay
and
give
it
to
ella
as
it
was
her
yellow
flowers
which
took
me
back
to
the
picturesque
little
place
if
she
can
not
understand
all
i
tell
her
now
she
will
learn
to
do
so
as
she
grows
older
i
was
a
young
man
then
just
beginning
to
make
my
way
as
an
artist
it
is
slow
work
at
first
until
you
have
made
a
name
every
one
looks
critically
at
your
work
when
once
you
have
been
pronounced
a
rising
artist
every
daub
from
your
brush
has
a
good
market
value
i
had
had
much
uphill
work
but
i
loved
my
profession
for
its
own
sake
and
i
worked
on
patiently
and
at
the
time
my
story
begins
several
of
my
pictures
had
sold
for
fair
prices
and
i
was
not
without
hope
that
i
might
soon
find
a
place
in
the
academy
it
was
an
unusually
hot
summer
and
london
was
emptying
fast
every
one
who
could
afford
it
was
going
either
to
the
moors
or
to
the
sea
and
i
felt
very
much
inclined
to
follow
their
example
my
father
and
mother
had
died
when
i
was
quite
a
child
and
the
maiden
aunt
who
had
brought
me
up
had
just
passed
away
and
i
had
mourned
her
death
very
deeply
for
she
had
been
both
father
and
mother
to
me
i
felt
that
i
needed
change
of
scene
for
i
had
been
up
for
many
nights
with
her
during
her
last
illness
and
i
had
had
my
rest
broken
for
so
long
that
i
found
it
very
difficult
to
sleep
and
in
many
ways
i
was
far
from
well
my
aunt
had
left
all
her
little
property
to
me
so
that
the
means
to
leave
london
and
to
take
a
suitable
holiday
were
not
wanting
the
question
was
where
should
i
go
i
was
anxious
to
combine
if
possible
pleasure
and
business
that
is
to
say
i
wished
to
choose
some
quiet
place
where
i
could
get
bracing
air
and
thorough
change
of
scene
and
where
i
could
also
find
studies
for
my
new
picture
which
was
at
least
so
i
fondly
dreamed
to
find
a
place
in
the
academy
the
following
spring
it
was
whilst
i
was
looking
for
a
suitable
spot
that
tom
bernard
my
great
friend
and
confidant
found
one
for
me
old
fellow
he
said
thrusting
a
torn
newspaper
into
my
hand
that
old
man
the
newspaper
was
doubled
down
tightly
and
a
great
red
cross
of
making
showed
me
the
part
he
wished
me
to
read
runswick
bay
this
charming
seaside
resort
is
not
half
so
well
known
as
it
deserves
to
be
for
the
lover
of
the
beautiful
for
the
man
with
an
artistic
eye
it
possesses
a
charm
which
words
would
fail
to
describe
the
little
bay
is
a
favourite
resort
for
artists
they
at
least
know
how
to
appreciate
its
beauties
it
would
be
well
for
any
who
may
desire
to
visit
this
wonderfully
picturesque
and
enchanting
spot
to
secure
hotel
or
accommodation
as
early
as
possible
for
the
demand
for
rooms
is
in
august
and
september
far
greater
than
the
supply
what
do
you
think
of
it
said
tom
sounds
just
the
thing
i
said
air
and
plenty
to
paint
you
go
i
replied
sooner
the
better
my
bag
was
soon
packed
my
easel
and
painting
materials
were
collected
and
the
very
next
morning
i
was
on
my
way
into
yorkshire
it
was
evening
when
i
reached
the
end
of
my
long
tiring
railway
journey
and
when
hot
and
dusty
i
alighted
at
a
village
which
lay
about
two
miles
from
my
destination
i
saw
no
sign
of
beauty
as
i
walked
from
the
station
the
country
was
slightly
undulating
in
parts
but
as
a
rule
nothing
met
my
gaze
but
a
long
flat
stretch
of
field
after
field
covered
as
the
case
might
be
with
grass
or
corn
harebells
and
pink
campion
grew
on
the
banks
and
the
meadows
were
full
of
daisies
but
i
saw
nothing
besides
that
was
in
the
least
attractive
and
certainly
nothing
of
which
i
could
make
a
picture
a
family
from
york
had
come
by
the
same
train
and
i
had
learnt
from
their
conversation
that
they
had
engaged
lodgings
for
a
month
at
runswick
bay
the
children
two
boys
of
ten
and
twelve
and
a
little
girl
a
year
or
two
younger
were
full
of
excitement
on
their
arrival
where
is
the
sea
they
cried
we
do
want
to
see
the
sea
on
said
their
father
you
will
soon
see
it
so
we
ran
together
for
i
felt
myself
a
child
again
as
i
watched
them
and
if
ever
i
lagged
behind
one
or
other
of
them
would
turn
round
and
cry
on
come
on
we
shall
soon
see
it
then
suddenly
we
came
to
the
edge
of
the
high
cliff
and
the
sea
in
all
its
beauty
and
loveliness
burst
upon
us
the
small
bay
was
shut
in
by
rocks
on
either
side
and
on
the
descent
of
the
steep
cliff
was
built
the
little
fishing
village
i
think
i
have
never
seen
a
prettier
place
the
children
were
already
running
down
the
steep
rocky
path
i
can
not
call
it
a
road
which
led
down
to
the
sea
and
i
followed
more
slowly
behind
them
it
was
the
most
curiously
built
place
the
cottages
were
perched
on
the
rock
wherever
a
ledge
or
standing
place
could
be
found
steep
narrow
paths
or
small
flights
of
steps
led
from
one
to
another
there
was
no
street
in
the
whole
place
there
could
be
none
for
there
were
hardly
two
houses
which
stood
on
the
same
level
to
take
a
walk
through
this
quaint
village
was
to
go
up
and
down
stairs
the
whole
time
at
last
after
a
long
downward
scramble
i
found
myself
on
the
shore
and
then
i
looked
back
at
the
cliff
and
at
the
irregular
little
town
i
did
not
wonder
that
artists
were
to
be
found
there
i
had
counted
four
as
i
came
down
the
hill
perched
on
different
platforms
on
the
rock
and
all
hard
at
work
at
their
easels
yes
it
was
certainly
a
picturesque
place
and
i
was
glad
that
i
had
come
the
colouring
was
charming
there
was
red
rock
in
the
background
here
and
there
covered
with
grass
and
ablaze
with
flowers
wild
roses
and
poppies
and
white
daisies
all
contributed
to
make
the
old
rock
gay
but
the
yellow
ragwort
was
all
over
great
patches
of
it
grew
even
on
the
margin
of
the
sand
and
its
bright
flowers
gave
the
whole
place
a
golden
colouring
there
seemed
to
be
yellow
everywhere
and
the
cottages
and
the
fishermen
in
their
blue
jerseys
and
the
countless
flights
of
steps
all
appeared
to
be
framed
in
the
brightest
gilt
yes
i
felt
sure
i
should
find
something
to
paint
in
runswick
bay
i
was
not
disappointed
in
tom
choice
for
me
illustration
chapter
ii
little
john
after
admiring
the
beauties
of
my
new
surroundings
for
some
little
time
i
felt
that
i
must
begin
to
look
for
quarters
i
was
anxious
if
possible
to
find
a
lodging
in
one
of
the
cottages
and
then
after
a
good
night
rest
i
would
carefully
select
a
good
subject
for
my
picture
i
called
at
several
houses
where
i
noticed
a
card
in
the
window
announcing
to
but
i
met
the
same
answer
everywhere
sir
quite
full
in
one
place
i
was
offered
a
bed
in
the
kitchen
but
the
whole
place
smelt
so
strongly
of
fried
herrings
and
of
fish
oil
that
i
felt
it
would
be
far
more
pleasant
to
sleep
on
the
beach
than
to
attempt
to
do
so
in
that
close
and
unwholesome
atmosphere
after
wandering
up
and
down
for
some
time
i
passed
a
house
close
to
the
village
green
and
saw
the
children
with
whom
i
had
travelled
sitting
at
tea
close
to
the
open
window
they
too
were
eating
herrings
and
the
smell
made
me
hungry
i
began
to
feel
that
it
was
time
i
had
something
to
eat
and
i
thought
my
best
plan
would
be
to
retrace
my
steps
to
the
hotel
which
i
had
passed
on
my
way
and
which
stood
at
the
very
top
of
the
high
cliff
i
turned
a
little
lazy
when
i
thought
of
the
climb
for
i
was
tired
with
my
journey
and
as
i
said
before
i
was
not
very
strong
and
to
drag
my
bag
and
easel
up
the
rugged
ascent
would
require
a
mighty
effort
at
the
best
of
times
i
noticed
that
wooden
benches
had
been
placed
here
and
there
on
the
different
platforms
of
the
rock
for
the
convenience
of
the
fishermen
and
i
determined
to
rest
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
on
one
of
them
before
retracing
my
steps
up
the
steep
hill
to
the
hotel
the
fishermen
were
filling
most
of
the
seats
sitting
side
by
side
row
after
row
of
them
talking
together
and
looking
down
at
the
beach
below
as
i
gazed
up
at
them
they
looked
to
me
like
so
many
blue
birds
perched
on
the
steep
rock
there
was
one
seat
in
a
quiet
corner
which
i
noticed
was
empty
i
went
to
it
and
laying
my
knapsack
and
other
belongings
beside
me
i
sat
down
to
rest
but
i
was
not
long
to
remain
alone
a
minute
afterwards
a
young
fisherman
dressed
like
his
mates
in
blue
jersey
and
oilskin
cap
planted
himself
on
the
other
end
of
the
seat
which
i
had
selected
sir
he
said
do
you
think
of
our
bay
a
pretty
place
very
pretty
i
said
like
it
well
enough
now
but
i
daresay
i
shall
like
it
better
still
still
he
repeated
it
the
better
for
knowing
in
my
opinion
sir
and
i
to
know
if
any
one
should
for
i
lived
my
lifetime
here
i
turned
to
look
at
him
as
he
spoke
and
i
felt
at
once
that
i
had
come
across
one
of
nature
gentlemen
he
was
a
fine
specimen
of
an
honest
english
fisherman
with
dark
eyes
and
hair
and
with
a
sunny
smile
on
his
sunburnt
face
you
had
only
to
look
at
the
man
to
feel
sure
that
you
could
trust
him
and
that
like
nathanael
there
was
no
guile
in
him
wonder
if
you
could
help
me
i
said
want
to
find
a
room
here
if
i
can
but
every
place
seems
so
full
it
is
full
sir
in
august
that
the
main
time
here
let
me
see
there
brown
they
full
and
robinson
and
wilson
and
thomson
all
full
up
there
giles
they
have
a
room
i
believe
but
they
not
over
clean
maybe
you
particular
sir
i
said
do
like
things
clean
i
do
mind
how
rough
they
are
if
they
only
clean
he
said
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
would
care
for
one
pan
to
do
all
the
work
of
the
house
to
boil
the
dirty
clothes
and
the
fish
and
your
bit
of
pudding
for
dinner
and
not
overmuch
cleaning
of
it
in
between
i
said
laughing
should
not
like
that
certainly
give
the
pudding
a
flavour
of
stockings
and
a
sauce
of
fish
oil
he
answered
you
right
sir
i
should
like
it
myself
cleanliness
is
next
to
godliness
that
my
idea
well
then
that
being
as
it
is
i
would
go
to
giles
not
if
them
is
your
sentiments
with
regard
to
pans
sir
i
suppose
there
nothing
for
it
but
to
trudge
up
to
the
hotel
at
the
top
of
the
hill
i
said
with
something
of
a
groan
sir
he
said
hesitating
a
little
and
my
missus
we
have
a
room
as
we
lets
sometimes
but
it
a
poor
place
sir
homely
like
as
ye
may
say
maybe
you
would
put
up
with
it
you
let
me
see
it
i
asked
pleasure
sir
it
rough
but
it
clean
we
could
promise
you
a
clean
pan
sir
my
missus
she
a
good
one
for
cleaning
she
not
one
of
them
slatternly
lasses
there
heaps
of
them
here
sir
idling
away
their
time
she
a
good
girl
is
my
polly
why
if
that
is
little
john
up
the
steps
to
his
daddy
he
jumped
up
as
he
said
this
and
ran
quickly
down
the
steep
flight
of
steps
which
led
down
from
the
height
on
which
the
seat
was
placed
and
soon
returned
with
a
little
lad
about
two
years
old
in
his
arms
the
child
was
as
fair
as
his
father
was
dark
he
was
a
pretty
boy
with
light
hair
and
blue
eyes
and
was
tidily
dressed
in
a
bright
red
cap
and
clean
ready
daddy
said
the
boy
home
with
little
john
you
would
object
to
a
cup
o
tea
sir
said
the
father
turning
to
me
hearten
you
up
a
bit
after
your
journey
and
there
sure
to
be
herrings
we
almost
lives
on
herrings
here
sir
and
then
if
you
so
minded
you
can
look
at
the
room
after
ye
excuse
me
if
i
make
too
bold
sir
he
added
as
he
gently
patted
little
tiny
hand
which
rested
on
his
arm
shall
be
only
too
glad
to
come
i
said
i
am
very
hungry
and
if
polly
room
is
as
nice
as
i
think
it
will
be
it
will
be
just
the
place
for
me
he
walked
in
front
of
me
up
and
down
several
flights
of
steps
until
at
some
little
distance
lower
down
the
hill
he
stopped
before
a
small
cottage
sure
enough
there
were
herrings
frying
and
spluttering
on
the
fire
and
there
too
was
polly
herself
arrayed
in
a
clean
white
apron
and
turning
the
herrings
with
a
fork
the
kitchen
was
very
low
and
the
rafters
seemed
resting
on
my
head
as
i
entered
but
the
window
and
door
were
both
wide
open
and
the
whole
place
struck
me
as
being
wonderfully
sweet
and
clean
a
low
wooden
settle
stood
by
the
fire
one
or
two
plain
deal
chairs
by
the
wall
and
little
john
stool
was
placed
close
to
his
father
a
small
shelf
above
the
fireplace
held
the
family
library
i
noticed
a
bible
a
a
and
several
other
books
all
of
which
had
seen
their
best
days
and
were
doubtless
in
constant
use
on
the
walls
were
prints
in
wooden
frames
and
much
discoloured
by
the
turf
smoke
of
the
fire
upon
a
carved
old
oak
cupboard
which
held
the
clothes
of
the
family
were
arranged
various
rare
shells
and
stones
curious
and
other
treasures
of
the
sea
and
in
the
centre
the
chief
ornament
of
the
house
and
the
pride
of
polly
heart
a
ship
carved
and
rigged
by
duncan
himself
and
preserved
carefully
under
a
glass
shade
polly
gave
me
a
hearty
yorkshire
welcome
and
we
soon
gathered
about
the
small
round
table
duncan
with
little
john
on
his
knee
asked
a
blessing
and
polly
poured
out
the
tea
and
we
all
did
justice
to
the
meal
the
more
i
saw
of
these
honest
people
the
more
i
liked
them
and
felt
inclined
to
trust
them
when
tea
was
over
polly
took
me
to
see
the
in
which
her
husband
had
offered
me
a
bed
it
was
a
low
room
in
the
roof
containing
a
plain
wooden
bedstead
one
chair
a
small
stand
and
a
square
of
hanging
on
the
wall
there
was
no
other
furniture
and
indeed
there
was
room
for
no
other
and
the
room
was
unadorned
except
by
three
or
four
funeral
cards
in
dismal
black
frames
which
were
hanging
at
different
heights
on
the
wall
opposite
the
bed
but
the
square
casement
window
was
thrown
wide
open
and
the
pure
sea
air
filled
the
little
room
and
the
coarse
white
coverings
of
the
bed
were
spotless
and
indeed
the
whole
place
looked
and
felt
both
fresh
and
clean
pardon
me
sir
said
duncan
asking
you
to
look
at
such
a
poor
place
i
like
it
duncan
i
answered
i
like
you
and
i
like
your
wife
and
if
you
will
have
me
as
a
lodger
i
am
willing
and
glad
to
stay
the
terms
were
soon
agreed
upon
to
the
satisfaction
of
both
parties
and
then
all
things
being
settled
polly
went
to
put
little
john
to
bed
whilst
i
went
with
duncan
to
see
his
boat
it
was
an
old
boat
and
it
had
been
his
father
before
him
and
it
had
weathered
many
a
storm
but
it
was
the
dream
of
duncan
life
to
buy
a
new
one
and
he
and
polly
had
nearly
saved
up
money
enough
for
it
why
me
and
the
missus
is
glad
to
get
a
lodger
now
and
again
he
said
all
goes
to
the
boat
every
penny
of
it
we
mean
to
call
her
the
little
john
he
going
in
her
the
very
first
voyage
she
takes
he
is
indeed
sir
for
he
be
her
captain
one
day
please
god
little
john
will
it
was
a
calm
beautiful
evening
the
sea
was
like
a
sheet
of
glass
hardly
a
ripple
was
breaking
on
the
shore
the
sun
was
setting
behind
the
cliff
and
the
fishing
village
would
soon
be
in
darkness
the
fishermen
were
leaving
their
cottages
and
were
making
for
the
shore
already
some
of
the
boats
were
launched
and
the
men
were
throwing
in
their
nets
and
and
were
pulling
out
to
sea
i
enjoyed
watching
my
new
friend
making
his
preparations
his
three
mates
brought
out
the
nets
and
he
gave
his
orders
with
a
tone
of
command
he
was
the
owner
and
the
captain
of
the
mary
ann
and
the
rest
were
accustomed
to
do
his
bidding
when
all
were
on
board
duncan
himself
jumped
in
and
gave
the
word
to
push
from
shore
he
nodded
to
me
and
bid
me
and
when
he
was
a
little
way
from
shore
i
saw
him
stand
up
in
the
boat
and
wave
his
cap
to
some
one
above
me
on
the
cliff
i
looked
up
and
saw
polly
standing
on
the
rock
overhanging
the
shore
with
little
john
in
his
white
nightgown
in
her
arms
he
was
waving
his
red
cap
to
his
father
and
continued
to
do
so
till
the
boat
was
out
of
sight
chapter
iii
strange
music
i
slept
well
in
my
strange
little
bedroom
although
i
was
awakened
early
by
the
sunlight
streaming
in
at
the
window
i
jumped
up
and
looked
out
the
sun
was
rising
over
the
sea
and
a
flood
of
golden
light
was
streaming
across
it
i
dressed
quickly
and
went
out
very
few
people
were
about
for
the
fishermen
had
not
yet
returned
from
their
night
fishing
the
cliff
looked
even
more
beautiful
than
the
night
before
for
every
bit
of
colouring
stood
out
clear
and
distinct
in
the
sunshine
shall
get
my
best
effects
in
the
morning
i
said
to
myself
i
had
better
choose
my
subject
at
once
so
that
after
breakfast
i
may
be
able
to
begin
without
delay
how
many
steps
i
went
up
and
how
many
i
went
down
before
i
came
to
a
decision
it
would
be
impossible
to
tell
but
at
last
i
found
a
place
which
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
very
gem
of
the
whole
village
an
old
disused
boat
stood
in
the
foreground
and
over
this
a
large
fishing
net
covered
with
floats
was
spread
to
dry
behind
rose
the
rocks
covered
with
tufts
of
grass
patches
of
gorse
tall
yellow
mustard
plants
and
golden
ragwort
and
at
the
top
of
a
steep
flight
of
steps
stood
a
white
cottage
with
roof
the
little
garden
in
front
of
it
gay
with
hollyhocks
and
dahlias
a
group
of
barefooted
children
were
standing
by
the
gate
feeding
some
chickens
and
ducks
a
large
dog
was
lying
asleep
at
the
top
of
the
steps
and
a
black
cat
was
basking
in
the
morning
sunshine
on
the
low
garden
wall
it
was
to
my
mind
an
extremely
pretty
scene
and
it
made
me
long
to
be
busy
with
my
brush
i
hurried
back
to
my
lodging
and
found
polly
preparing
my
breakfast
whilst
little
john
looked
on
he
was
sitting
in
his
nightgown
curled
up
in
his
father
armchair
daddy
he
called
out
to
me
as
i
came
in
there
was
a
little
round
table
laid
ready
for
me
and
covered
with
a
spotlessly
clean
cloth
and
on
it
was
a
small
black
teapot
and
a
white
and
gold
cup
and
saucer
upon
which
i
saw
the
golden
announcement
present
from
whitby
whilst
my
plate
was
adorned
with
a
remarkable
picture
of
whitby
abbey
in
a
thunderstorm
there
were
herrings
of
course
and
polly
had
made
some
hot
cakes
the
like
of
which
are
never
seen
outside
yorkshire
these
were
ready
buttered
and
were
lying
wrapped
in
a
clean
cloth
in
front
of
the
fire
polly
made
the
tea
as
soon
as
i
entered
and
then
retired
with
little
john
in
her
arms
into
the
bedroom
whilst
i
sat
down
with
a
good
appetite
to
my
breakfast
i
had
not
quite
finished
my
meal
when
i
heard
a
great
shout
from
the
shore
women
and
children
lads
and
lasses
ran
past
the
open
door
crying
boats
the
boats
polly
came
flying
into
the
kitchen
caught
up
little
john
red
cap
thrust
it
on
his
head
and
ran
down
the
steps
i
left
my
breakfast
unfinished
and
followed
them
it
was
a
pretty
sight
the
were
just
nearing
shore
and
almost
every
one
in
the
place
had
turned
out
to
meet
them
wives
children
and
visitors
were
gathered
on
the
small
landing
place
most
had
dishes
or
plates
in
their
hands
for
the
herrings
could
be
bought
straight
from
the
boats
the
family
from
york
were
there
and
they
greeted
me
as
an
old
friend
when
the
little
village
had
been
abundantly
supplied
with
fish
the
rest
of
the
herrings
were
packed
up
and
sent
off
by
train
to
be
sold
elsewhere
it
was
a
pretty
animated
scene
and
i
wished
i
had
brought
my
sketchbook
with
me
i
thought
the
arrival
of
the
fishing
boats
would
make
a
splendid
subject
for
a
picture
duncan
was
too
busy
even
to
see
me
till
the
fish
were
all
landed
counted
and
disposed
of
but
he
had
time
for
a
word
with
little
john
and
as
i
was
finishing
my
breakfast
he
came
in
with
the
child
perched
on
his
shoulder
morning
sir
he
said
how
do
you
like
our
bay
this
morning
my
answer
fully
satisfied
him
and
whilst
he
sat
down
to
his
morning
meal
i
went
out
to
begin
my
work
it
was
a
lovely
day
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
prospect
before
me
i
found
a
shady
place
just
under
the
wall
of
a
house
where
my
picture
would
be
in
sunlight
and
i
and
my
easel
in
shadow
i
liked
the
spot
i
had
chosen
even
better
than
i
had
done
before
breakfast
and
i
was
soon
hard
at
work
i
had
sketched
in
my
picture
and
was
beginning
to
paint
when
i
became
conscious
of
the
sound
of
voices
just
over
my
head
and
i
soon
became
equally
conscious
that
they
were
talking
about
me
just
like
it
said
one
voice
do
look
there
betty
green
cottage
and
minnie
the
cat
and
the
seat
and
the
old
boat
illustration
me
see
marjorie
said
another
voice
it
the
old
one
with
white
hair
and
a
long
long
beard
it
quite
a
young
one
his
hair
black
and
he
has
got
a
beard
at
all
me
look
yes
i
can
see
him
i
like
him
much
better
than
the
old
one
has
he
got
nice
red
cheeks
he
hear
said
the
other
voice
naughty
boy
i
believe
he
did
hear
i
saw
him
laugh
i
jumped
up
at
this
and
looked
up
but
i
could
see
nothing
but
a
garden
wall
and
a
thick
bushy
tree
which
was
growing
just
inside
it
who
there
i
shouted
but
there
was
dead
silence
and
as
no
one
appeared
and
nothing
more
happened
i
sat
down
and
went
on
with
my
picture
many
people
passed
by
as
i
was
painting
and
tried
to
look
at
what
i
was
doing
some
glanced
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
as
they
walked
on
others
paused
behind
me
and
silently
watched
me
a
few
made
remarks
to
one
another
about
my
picture
one
or
two
offered
suggestions
thought
i
should
have
had
a
better
view
lower
down
the
hill
or
hoped
that
i
would
make
the
colouring
vivid
enough
the
children
with
whom
i
had
travelled
seemed
to
feel
a
kind
of
partnership
in
my
picture
go
and
look
at
artist
bob
would
say
to
harry
picture
is
going
to
be
the
best
of
the
lot
they
were
so
fond
of
watching
me
and
so
much
excited
over
what
i
was
doing
that
as
time
went
on
i
was
often
obliged
to
ask
them
to
move
further
away
so
eager
were
they
to
watch
every
movement
of
my
brush
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
my
morning
work
and
went
back
very
hungry
and
quite
ready
for
the
comfortable
little
dinner
which
polly
had
prepared
for
me
in
the
afternoon
the
light
would
be
all
wrong
for
my
picture
but
i
determined
to
sketch
in
the
foreground
and
prepare
for
my
next
morning
work
i
was
very
busy
upon
this
when
suddenly
i
became
conscious
of
music
if
music
it
could
be
called
it
was
the
most
peculiar
sound
and
at
first
i
could
not
find
out
from
whence
it
came
it
was
evidently
not
caused
by
a
wind
instrument
i
felt
sure
it
was
not
a
concertina
or
an
accordion
this
sound
would
go
on
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
stop
suddenly
only
to
begin
again
more
loudly
a
few
seconds
later
at
times
i
distinguished
a
few
bars
of
a
tune
then
only
disjointed
notes
followed
could
it
be
a
child
strumming
idly
on
a
harmonium
but
no
it
was
not
at
all
like
an
instrument
of
that
kind
it
was
an
annoying
worrying
sound
and
it
went
on
for
so
long
that
i
began
to
be
vexed
with
it
and
stamped
my
foot
impatiently
when
after
a
short
interval
i
heard
it
begin
again
the
sound
seemed
to
come
from
behind
the
wall
of
the
house
near
which
i
was
sitting
and
it
was
repeated
from
time
to
time
during
the
whole
of
the
afternoon
at
length
as
the
afternoon
went
on
i
began
to
distinguish
what
tunes
were
being
attempted
i
made
out
a
bar
or
two
of
the
old
french
republican
air
marseillaise
and
then
i
was
almost
startled
by
what
came
next
for
it
was
a
tune
i
had
known
well
since
i
was
a
very
little
child
it
was
sweet
home
and
that
was
my
favourite
tune
in
fact
i
never
heard
it
without
thinking
of
her
many
and
many
a
time
had
she
sung
me
to
sleep
with
that
tune
i
had
scarlet
fever
when
i
was
five
years
old
and
my
mother
had
nursed
me
through
it
and
when
i
was
weary
and
fretful
she
would
sing
to
me
my
pretty
mother
even
as
i
sat
before
my
easel
i
could
see
her
as
she
sat
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
with
the
sunshine
streaming
upon
her
through
the
window
and
making
her
look
to
my
boyish
imagination
like
a
beautiful
angel
and
i
could
hear
her
voice
still
and
the
sweet
tones
in
which
she
sang
that
very
song
to
me
sweet
home
there
no
place
like
home
i
remembered
one
night
especially
in
which
she
knelt
by
my
bed
and
prayed
that
she
might
meet
her
boy
in
the
bright
city
the
sweet
home
above
the
sky
which
was
the
best
and
brightest
home
of
all
i
wonder
what
she
would
think
of
me
now
i
said
to
myself
and
whether
she
ever
will
see
me
there
i
very
much
doubt
it
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
a
long
way
off
from
home
sweet
home
now
my
mother
had
died
soon
after
that
illness
of
mine
and
i
knew
that
she
had
gone
to
live
in
that
beautiful
home
of
which
she
had
so
often
spoken
to
me
and
i
had
been
left
behind
and
my
aunt
who
had
brought
me
up
had
cared
for
none
of
these
things
and
i
had
learnt
to
look
at
the
world
and
at
life
from
her
worldly
standpoint
and
had
forgotten
to
seek
first
the
kingdom
of
god
oh
if
my
mother
only
knew
my
pretty
beautiful
mother
i
said
to
myself
that
day
and
then
there
came
the
thought
perhaps
she
know
and
the
thought
made
me
very
uncomfortable
i
wished
more
than
ever
that
that
cracked
old
instrument
whatever
it
was
would
stop
but
in
spite
of
all
my
wishes
the
strange
sound
went
on
and
again
and
again
i
had
to
listen
to
sweet
home
and
each
time
that
it
came
it
set
my
memory
going
and
brought
back
to
me
the
words
and
the
looks
which
i
thought
i
had
forgotten
and
it
set
something
else
going
too
the
still
small
voice
within
accusing
me
of
forgetfulness
not
so
much
of
my
mother
as
of
my
mother
god
i
began
to
wish
most
heartily
that
i
had
chosen
some
other
spot
for
my
picture
but
it
was
working
out
so
well
that
i
felt
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
to
change
and
i
hoped
that
the
individual
man
woman
or
child
who
had
been
making
that
horrible
noise
might
find
some
other
employment
and
might
leave
me
in
peace
the
next
day
my
wishes
were
fulfilled
for
i
was
not
disturbed
and
very
little
happened
except
that
my
picture
made
progress
then
came
two
wet
days
on
which
i
had
to
paint
in
my
little
chamber
and
did
not
get
back
to
my
seat
under
the
wall
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
duncan
during
those
wet
days
he
would
come
and
sit
beside
me
as
i
painted
and
would
tell
me
stories
of
storms
and
shipwrecks
and
of
the
different
times
when
the
lifeboat
had
been
sent
out
and
of
the
many
lives
she
had
saved
ye
seen
her
sir
you
must
go
and
have
a
look
at
our
boat
she
lies
in
a
house
down
by
the
shore
as
trim
and
tight
a
little
boat
as
you
could
wish
to
see
anywhere
suppose
you
been
in
many
a
storm
yourself
duncan
i
said
sir
i
very
near
lived
in
them
ever
since
i
was
born
many
and
many
the
time
i
never
expected
to
see
land
again
i
did
care
so
much
when
i
was
a
young
chap
you
see
my
father
and
mother
were
dead
and
if
i
went
to
the
bottom
there
was
nobody
as
you
might
say
to
feel
it
but
it
different
now
sir
you
see
i
said
polly
and
little
john
just
where
it
is
sir
polly
and
little
john
bless
and
all
the
time
the
wind
raging
and
the
waves
is
coming
right
over
the
boat
i
thinking
of
my
poor
lass
at
home
and
how
every
gust
of
wind
will
be
sweeping
right
over
her
heart
and
how
she
be
kneeling
by
little
john
bed
praying
god
to
bring
his
daddy
safe
home
again
and
i
know
sir
as
well
as
i
know
anything
that
when
god
almighty
hears
and
answers
her
prayer
and
brings
me
safe
to
land
polly
and
little
john
will
be
standing
on
yon
rocks
their
eyes
for
the
first
sight
of
the
boats
and
then
down
almost
into
the
water
to
welcome
me
home
again
yes
it
makes
a
sight
o
difference
to
a
married
man
sir
does
it
now
it
is
the
dying
ye
understand
it
the
leaving
behind
as
i
think
of
i
not
afraid
to
die
he
added
humbly
and
reverently
as
he
took
off
his
oilskin
cap
know
whom
i
have
believed
a
plucky
fellow
duncan
i
said
talk
of
not
being
afraid
to
die
i
just
been
at
a
and
you
felt
you
would
like
to
be
there
yourself
duncan
went
on
as
i
stopped
maybe
not
it
comes
to
us
sir
we
born
with
that
feeling
i
often
think
and
we
can
no
more
help
it
than
we
can
help
any
other
thing
we
born
with
but
what
i
mean
to
say
is
i
not
afraid
of
what
comes
death
it
may
be
a
dark
tunnel
sir
but
there
light
at
the
far
end
illustration
chapter
iv
what
are
you
on
saturday
of
that
week
the
sun
shone
brightly
and
i
was
up
betimes
had
an
early
breakfast
and
set
to
work
at
my
picture
as
soon
as
possible
i
had
not
been
painting
long
before
i
again
heard
voices
above
me
the
same
childish
voices
that
i
had
heard
before
give
it
to
him
said
one
voice
marjorie
i
dare
you
take
it
ought
not
to
be
afraid
because
you
a
boy
said
the
first
speaker
says
boys
ought
always
to
be
brave
you
big
marjorie
and
big
people
ought
to
be
braver
than
little
people
there
was
a
long
whispered
conversation
after
this
and
i
could
not
distinguish
the
words
which
were
spoken
but
presently
a
small
piece
of
pink
paper
was
thrown
over
the
wall
and
fluttered
down
upon
my
palette
i
caught
it
up
quickly
to
prevent
it
from
sticking
to
the
paints
and
i
saw
there
was
something
printed
on
it
it
ran
thus
will
be
a
short
service
on
the
shore
on
sunday
morning
at
when
you
are
earnestly
requested
to
be
what
are
you
you
i
said
aloud
sent
me
this
there
was
no
answer
at
first
then
a
little
voice
just
above
me
said
of
us
sir
down
and
talk
to
me
i
said
ca
talk
to
children
whom
i
ca
see
come
out
here
and
look
at
my
picture
they
came
out
presently
hand
in
hand
a
little
girl
of
five
in
a
blue
cap
a
pale
pink
frock
and
a
white
pinafore
and
a
boy
of
three
the
merriest
most
sturdy
little
fellow
i
thought
i
had
ever
seen
his
face
was
as
round
and
rosy
as
an
apple
his
eyes
were
dark
blue
and
had
the
happiest
and
most
roguish
expression
that
it
would
be
possible
for
eyes
to
have
when
the
child
laughed
and
whenever
was
he
not
laughing
every
part
of
his
face
laughed
together
his
eyes
began
it
his
lips
followed
suit
even
his
nose
was
pressed
into
the
service
if
a
sunbeam
could
be
caught
and
dressed
up
like
a
little
boy
i
think
it
would
look
something
like
that
child
i
said
right
i
like
to
see
children
faces
when
i
talk
to
them
tell
me
your
names
to
begin
with
marjorie
sir
said
the
little
girl
he
jack
i
said
name
and
a
nice
name
too
is
it
little
jack
come
and
look
at
my
picture
little
jack
and
see
if
you
think
big
jack
knows
how
to
paint
by
degrees
they
grew
more
at
their
ease
and
chatted
freely
with
me
marjorie
told
me
that
her
father
had
sent
the
paper
father
was
going
to
preach
on
sunday
he
preached
every
sunday
and
numbers
of
people
came
and
jack
was
in
the
choir
what
a
dear
little
chorister
to
be
sure
a
chubby
little
cherub
if
ever
there
was
one
you
come
big
jack
he
said
patting
my
hand
with
his
strong
sturdy
little
fist
do
know
i
said
it
a
fine
day
perhaps
i
shall
want
to
get
on
with
my
picture
sunday
said
the
child
in
a
shocked
voice
on
sunday
father
preaches
and
you
could
paint
on
sunday
could
you
i
see
i
said
i
come
and
hear
you
sing
little
jack
you
big
jack
he
said
with
a
merry
twinkle
in
his
pretty
blue
eyes
is
this
preaching
on
the
shore
duncan
i
asked
it
our
lay
preacher
he
said
a
good
man
and
has
done
a
sight
of
good
in
this
place
you
see
it
too
far
for
folks
here
to
go
to
church
and
so
he
lives
amongst
us
and
has
meetings
in
the
hall
yonder
in
winter
and
in
summer
why
we
have
on
the
shore
and
the
visitors
comes
mostly
there
a
few
wo
come
but
we
get
the
best
of
them
and
we
have
some
fine
singing
real
nice
it
is
i
in
the
choir
myself
sir
he
said
would
think
it
but
i
am
i
got
a
good
strong
voice
too
it
must
be
a
choir
worth
seeing
i
thought
if
it
contained
two
such
strange
contrasts
the
big
burly
fisherman
and
the
tiny
child
who
had
invited
me
to
be
present
i
had
not
quite
made
up
my
mind
to
go
i
had
not
been
to
a
service
for
many
months
i
might
almost
say
years
i
had
slipped
out
of
it
lately
and
i
thought
i
should
feel
myself
a
fish
out
of
water
however
when
the
next
day
came
every
one
seemed
to
take
it
as
a
matter
of
course
that
i
should
be
going
polly
was
up
early
and
had
dressed
little
john
in
his
best
see
him
at
church
sir
she
said
as
she
laid
my
breakfast
always
likes
to
go
to
church
and
he
as
good
as
gold
bless
him
duncan
was
out
before
i
was
up
and
i
had
seen
him
as
i
was
dressing
going
round
to
the
fishermen
sitting
as
usual
on
the
seats
on
the
cliff
with
a
bundle
of
pink
papers
in
his
hand
similar
to
the
one
which
had
been
given
me
and
distributing
them
to
every
group
of
his
mates
which
he
came
across
yes
i
felt
that
i
was
expected
to
go
and
it
would
be
hard
work
to
keep
away
but
if
i
had
still
had
any
doubt
about
the
matter
it
would
have
surely
disappeared
when
at
ten
exactly
a
tiny
couple
came
toiling
hand
in
hand
up
the
steps
leading
to
door
and
announced
to
polly
that
they
had
come
to
call
for
big
jack
to
go
to
church
it
was
marjorie
and
her
little
brother
and
the
small
jack
put
his
little
fat
hand
into
that
of
big
jack
and
led
him
triumphantly
away
it
was
a
pretty
sight
to
see
that
congregation
gathering
on
the
village
green
from
the
fishermen
cottages
there
came
a
stream
of
people
down
to
the
shore
mothers
with
babies
in
their
arms
and
leading
young
children
by
the
hand
groups
of
boys
and
girls
wearing
shoes
and
stockings
who
had
been
barefooted
all
the
week
many
a
sailor
many
a
sunburnt
fisher
lad
many
elderly
people
too
old
men
and
women
in
white
caps
there
were
visitors
too
coming
down
from
the
rocks
and
these
mostly
kept
in
the
background
and
had
at
first
an
air
of
watching
the
movement
rather
than
joining
in
it
my
york
friends
were
however
well
to
the
front
and
the
children
nodded
to
me
and
smiled
at
one
another
as
they
saw
me
led
like
a
lamb
to
the
service
by
my
two
small
guardians
it
was
a
lovely
day
and
the
sandy
ground
was
dry
and
the
congregation
sat
on
the
rough
coarse
grass
or
perched
on
the
sand
hillocks
round
as
for
the
old
boat
it
was
occupied
by
the
choir
and
little
jack
having
seen
me
safely
to
the
spot
climbed
into
it
and
stood
proudly
in
the
stern
he
had
a
in
his
hand
which
i
knew
he
could
not
read
for
he
was
holding
it
upside
down
but
he
looked
at
it
as
long
and
as
earnestly
as
if
he
could
understand
every
word
marjorie
planted
herself
beside
me
i
suppose
to
watch
me
in
case
i
showed
signs
of
running
away
before
the
service
was
over
then
just
before
eleven
and
when
quite
a
large
company
of
people
had
gathered
on
the
green
her
father
arrived
he
was
a
man
of
about
forty
and
his
face
gave
me
the
impression
that
he
had
known
trouble
and
yet
i
fancied
as
i
looked
further
at
him
that
the
trouble
whatever
it
was
had
ended
he
seemed
to
me
like
one
who
has
come
out
of
a
sharp
storm
and
has
anchored
in
a
quiet
haven
for
whilst
i
noticed
in
his
face
the
traces
of
heavy
sorrow
still
at
the
same
time
he
looked
happier
and
more
peaceful
than
any
of
those
who
stood
round
him
in
fact
it
was
the
most
restful
face
i
had
ever
seen
he
was
not
an
educated
man
nor
was
he
what
men
call
a
gentleman
and
yet
there
was
a
refinement
about
him
which
made
one
feel
at
once
that
he
was
no
common
man
and
had
no
common
history
his
face
was
so
interesting
to
me
that
i
am
afraid
i
was
gazing
at
him
instead
of
finding
the
hymn
he
had
given
out
but
i
was
recalled
to
my
duty
by
his
little
daughter
who
seized
the
she
had
given
me
at
the
beginning
of
the
service
found
the
page
for
me
and
pointed
with
her
small
finger
to
the
place
it
was
a
mission
hymn
sung
to
a
wild
irregular
tune
i
daresay
i
should
have
smiled
if
i
had
heard
it
anywhere
else
but
it
was
no
laughing
matter
that
morning
as
i
looked
at
the
brown
fishermen
who
had
taken
off
their
oilskin
caps
as
i
glanced
at
the
earnest
face
of
the
preacher
as
i
noticed
how
even
children
like
little
marjorie
beside
me
were
singing
with
all
their
heart
and
soul
the
simple
plaintive
words
i
felt
strangely
solemnized
then
came
the
prayer
and
i
felt
as
he
prayed
that
one
whom
we
could
not
see
was
standing
amongst
us
it
was
a
very
simple
prayer
but
it
was
the
outpouring
of
his
heart
to
god
and
many
a
low
amen
broke
from
the
lips
of
the
fishermen
as
their
hearts
went
with
his
the
sermon
followed
shall
i
call
it
a
sermon
it
was
more
an
appeal
than
a
sermon
or
even
an
address
there
was
no
attempt
at
style
there
were
no
long
words
or
stilted
sentences
it
was
exactly
what
his
prayer
had
been
words
spoken
out
of
the
abundance
of
his
earnest
heart
the
prayer
had
contained
the
outpouring
of
his
soul
to
his
god
in
heaven
the
words
to
which
we
listened
afterwards
contained
the
outpouring
of
his
soul
to
us
his
brothers
and
sisters
on
earth
there
was
a
great
hush
over
the
congregation
whilst
he
spoke
the
mothers
quieted
their
babes
the
children
sat
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
speaker
even
those
visitors
who
had
been
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
drew
near
to
listen
are
you
dear
friends
he
began
is
our
subject
what
are
you
how
many
different
answers
i
hear

an
artist
with
great
ambition
of
future
success

an
old

who

a
storm
but

now
i
am
too
old
to
fish
too
tired
to
toil
am
a
gentleman
of
no
occupation
idling
comfortably
through
a
busy
world
and
here
he
glanced
at
his
own
little
jack
in
the
stern
of
the
old
boat
am
a
tiny
child
with
an
unknown
life
all
before
me
friends
such
are
some
of
your
answers
to
my
question
can
i
find
do
you
think
one
answer
one
description
which
will
suit
you

fishermen

and
girls
artists

the
old
man
and
the
little
child
yes
i
can
if
i
could
hand
you
each
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
pencil
this
day
there
is
one
description
of
yourself
which
each
of
you
might
write
one
occupation
which
would
include
you
all
the
old
the
young
the
rich
and
the
poor
each
of
you
without
exception
might
write
this
am
a
the
speaker
am
a
servant
you
who
listen
all
of
you
are
servants
i
do
know
how
he
is
going
to
make
that
out
i
said
to
myself
thought
he
was
going
to
say
we
were
all
sinners
and
i
suppose
we
are
but
i
do
not
believe
i
am
servant
servants
he
went
on
not
all
in
the
same
service
as
god
and
the
angels
look
down
upon
this
green
they
see
gathering
together
a
great
company
of
servants
but
they
also
see
that
we
are
not
all
servants
of
the
same
master
they
see
what
we
do
not
see
a
dividing
line
between
us
on
one
side
of
the
line
god
sees
and
the
angels
see
one
company
of
servants
and
in
god
book
he
gives
us
the
name
of
their
master
of
the
other
side
of
the
line
god
sees
and
the
angels
see
another
company
of
servants
of
company
do
you
belong
to
dear
friend
you
fishermen
on
the
bank
there
what
are
you
little
child
what
are
you
a
servant
of
sin
or
a
servant
of
jesus
christ
so
i
tried
to
turn
it
off
from
myself
and
to
forget
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
and
whenever
the
question
came
back
to
me
the
question
which
the
speaker
had
repeated
so
often
are
you
i
answered
it
by
saying
to
myself
am
a
poor
artist
having
a
holiday
in
runswick
bay
and
i
am
not
going
to
trouble
my
head
with
gloomy
thoughts
polly
had
prepared
an
excellent
dinner
in
honour
of
the
day
and
i
did
full
justice
to
it
then
i
determined
to
walk
to
staithes
and
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
in
seeing
the
country
i
had
always
been
accustomed
to
paint
on
sunday
but
only
one
of
the
artists
seemed
to
be
at
work
and
duncan
and
polly
had
been
so
much
shocked
by
seeing
him
that
i
did
not
venture
to
do
the
same
i
enjoyed
the
walk
along
the
cliffs
and
came
back
in
good
spirits
having
completely
shaken
off
as
i
imagined
the
remembrance
of
the
speaker
words
illustration
chapter
v
the
runswick
sports
got
a
big
favour
to
ask
of
you

duncan

next
day

taking
a
liberty
will
you
not

out
of
mischief
when

bound
to
be
after
the

i
said
for
these
young
lads

the
old

for
the
matter
of
that
i
suppose

subscription

i
added
as
i
handed

half
a
sovereign
ye
kindly
sir
i
wo
refuse
it
and
it
very
good
of
you
to

so
largely
but
that
is
what
i
came
to
ask
of

said
doubtfully

bother

quick
sir
and
see
duncan
you
want
the
programme
to
be
illustrated
i
your
man
i
do
it
at
once
i
was
really
only
too
glad
to
oblige
the
dear
honest
fellow
he
was
wonderfully
pleased
at
my
ready
consent
and
went
off
at
once
to
procure
a
board
upon
which
my
programme
might
be
fastened
we
soon
made
out
together
a
list
of
attractions
and
i
had
great
pleasure
in
beautifying
and
illustrating
the
catalogue
of
sports
i
headed
it
thus
oyez
oyez
runswick
athletic
sports
then
from
the
r
of
runswick
i
hung
a
long
fishing
net
covered
with
floats
and
falling
down
over
a
fish
basket
and
some
whilst
on
the
ground
were
lying
a
number
of
fish
which
had
been
emptied
out
of
the
basket
next
followed
a
list
of
patrons
such
as
the
honourable
lord
crabby
lobster
sir
shrimp
etc
then
came
a
list
of
the
various
sports
each
profusely
illustrated
the
tug
of
war
the
jockey
race
the
women
egg
and
spoon
race
the
sack
race
the
greasy
pole
the
long
jump
etc
and
lastly
an
announcement
of
a
grand
concert
to
be
held
in
the
evening
as
a
conclusion
of
the
festivities
of
the
day
duncan
was
more
than
satisfied
he
was
delighted
and
his
gratitude
knew
no
bounds
his
excitement
as
he
carried
the
board
away
to
hang
it
in
a
conspicuous
place
was
like
the
excitement
of
a
child
the
whole
village
seemed
to
be
stirred
as
the
eventful
day
drew
near
you
going
to
see
the
great
tug
big
mr
jack
my
little
friend
called
to
me
over
the
wall
as
i
was
painting
as
for
the
york
boys
harry
and
bob
they
spent
a
great
part
of
every
day
in
admiring
the
programme
and
in
bringing
other
visitors
to
see
and
admire
the
work
of
artist
how
anxiously
duncan
watched
the
sky
the
day
before
the
sports
and
how
triumphantly
polly
announced
when
i
came
down
to
breakfast
fine
day
sir
could
be
finer
could
it
now
those
village
sports
were
really
a
pretty
sight
i
see
it
all
in
my
mind
eye
now
i
often
wonder
i
have
not
made
a
picture
of
it
the
high
cliff
stretching
overhead
and
covered
with
bushes
and
bracken
amongst
which
nestled
the
cottages
then
below
the
cliff
the
level
green
covered
with
strong
hardy
fishermen
and
their
sunburnt
wives
and
surrounding
the
green
on
the
the
visitors
old
and
young
dressed
in
bright
colours
and
holiday
attire
is
it
too
late
to
paint
it
from
memory
i
wonder
i
see
it
all
still
so
distinctly
the
sports
lasted
a
long
time
and
went
off
well
polly
distinguished
herself
by
winning
the
egg
and
spoon
race
much
to
the
joy
of
little
john
who
watched
all
the
proceedings
from
his
father
arms
then
came
the
greatest
event
of
all
the
tug
of
war
a
long
cable
was
brought
out
and
stretched
across
the
green
and
a
was
tied
in
the
centre
of
it
two
stakes
were
then
driven
into
the
ground
and
between
these
a
line
was
chalked
on
the
grass
the
handkerchief
was
then
placed
exactly
over
the
line
after
this
all
the
fishermen
who
entered
the
lists
were
divided
into
two
parties
then
each
side
laid
hold
of
one
end
of
the
rope
and
at
a
given
signal
they
began
to
pull
it
was
a
trial
of
strength
whichever
side
could
draw
the
handkerchief
past
the
two
stakes
and
over
the
line
that
side
would
win
how
tremendously
those
men
pulled
what
force
they
put
into
it
yet
for
a
long
time
the
rope
did
not
move
a
single
inch
all
the
strength
of
those
powerful
fishermen
was
put
out
they
were
lying
on
the
ground
that
their
pull
might
be
all
the
stronger
every
sinew
every
nerve
every
muscle
seemed
to
be
on
the
strain
but
so
evenly
were
the
two
sides
matched
that
the
rope
was
motionless
and
it
seemed
impossible
to
tell
which
party
would
win
little
john
was
eagerly
watching
his
father
daddy
pull
i
heard
him
cry
and
i
think
i
was
nearly
as
pleased
as
he
and
polly
were
when
duncan
and
the
mates
on
his
side
suddenly
made
one
mighty
effort
and
the
handkerchief
was
drawn
across
the
line
there
was
tremendous
cheering
after
this
polly
clapped
her
hands
with
delight
and
little
jack
and
big
jack
nearly
shouted
themselves
hoarse
it
was
an
interesting
sight
and
i
had
reason
to
remember
it
afterwards
as
you
will
see
the
evening
concert
went
off
as
well
as
the
sports
had
done
and
duncan
came
in
at
night
rather
tired
but
well
satisfied
with
the
day
proceedings
i
enjoyed
all
the
sights
at
runswick
bay
but
i
think
i
was
particularly
charmed
with
what
happened
on
the
day
after
the
sports
all
the
village
was
early
astir
and
as
i
was
dressing
it
seemed
to
me
that
every
fisherman
in
the
place
was
hurrying
down
to
the
beach
it
was
not
long
before
i
followed
them
to
see
what
they
were
doing
i
found
that
they
were
about
to
draw
the
up
from
the
shore
to
a
place
where
they
would
be
safe
from
the
winter
storms
it
was
hard
work
but
every
one
was
there
to
give
a
hand
a
long
string
of
men
and
lads
laid
hold
of
the
strong
cable
fastened
to
the
boat
even
the
wives
and
elder
children
caught
hold
of
it
i
myself
went
to
their
help
and
several
of
the
visitors
followed
my
example
then
when
we
were
all
in
position
there
came
a
pause
for
duncan
who
was
directing
the
proceedings
charged
us
not
to
pull
till
the
signal
was
given
then
there
rose
a
peculiar
cry
or
yodel
all
the
fishermen
uttering
it
together
and
as
soon
as
it
ceased
we
gave
our
united
mighty
pull
then
we
paused
to
take
breath
until
once
more
there
came
a
yodel
followed
by
another
pull
and
as
this
was
repeated
again
and
again
it
was
grand
to
see
the
heavy
boat
making
steady
and
regular
progress
across
the
heavy
sand
she
came
up
the
low
bank
over
the
rough
grass
slowly
steadily
surely
she
moved
onward
until
at
length
she
was
placed
in
safety
far
out
of
reach
of
the
highest
tide
and
the
strongest
sea
thus
one
after
another
the
boats
were
drawn
up
and
we
were
fairly
tired
before
our
work
was
done
i
think
it
must
have
been
that
very
day
that
as
i
was
sitting
painting
i
once
more
heard
the
broken
notes
of
the
instrument
which
had
troubled
me
so
much
before
it
was
that
tune
again
my
mother
tune
and
somehow
i
do
not
know
how
it
was
with
the
sound
of
my
tune
there
came
back
to
my
mind
the
remembrance
of
the
sunday
service
ah
my
mother
was
on
the
right
side
of
the
line
i
said
to
myself
she
was
a
servant
of
christ
but
her
son
what
is
he
i
did
not
want
to
follow
out
this
subject
so
i
jumped
up
from
my
and
standing
under
the
wall
i
called
jack
little
jack
the
music
stopped
at
once
and
the
child
came
out
dear
little
merry
fellow
how
fond
i
was
of
him
already
big
jack
he
said
as
he
ran
out
of
the
gate
and
talk
to
me
old
chappie
i
said
i
paint
who
plays
music
in
your
house
do
said
little
jack
do
jack
why
you
are
a
funny
little
fellow
to
play
music
what
do
you
play
on
and
who
taught
you
teached
me
jack
he
said
teached
my
own
self
your
own
self
why
how
did
you
manage
that
i
asked
turned
him
round
and
round
and
round
jack
and
the
music
came
and
i
teached
my
own
self
he
repeated
is
it
jack
i
asked
it
an
old
musical
box
it
an
organ
a
mr
jack
a
you
mean
little
chappie
why
however
in
the
world
did
you
get
hold
of
a
is
it
a
little
toy
one
it
big
ever
so
big
he
said
stretching
out
his
hands
to
show
me
its
size
whoever
gave
you
it
i
asked
is
jack
own
organ
said
the
child
is
it
then
father
father
own
organ
it
seemed
to
me
a
most
extraordinary
thing
for
the
mission
preacher
of
runswick
bay
to
have
in
his
possession
but
i
did
not
like
to
ask
any
more
questions
at
that
time
however
in
the
afternoon
my
little
friend
called
to
me
over
the
wall
jack
come
here
where
my
little
man
inside
and
look
at
father
organ
i
play
it
to
you
mr
jack
will
father
say
if
i
come
in
out
will
mother
say
out
too
i
did
not
much
relish
the
idea
of
entering
a
man
house
in
his
absence
but
such
plaintive
entreaties
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
wall
over
and
over
again
he
pleaded
come
jack
do
come
quick
mr
jack
that
at
last
to
please
the
child
i
left
my
work
for
a
few
minutes
and
went
up
the
steps
which
led
to
the
gate
of
their
garden
it
was
only
a
small
place
but
very
prettily
laid
out
there
was
a
tiny
lawn
well
kept
and
covered
with
short
soft
grass
and
in
the
centre
of
this
a
round
bed
filled
with
geraniums
calceolarias
and
lobelias
round
the
lawn
at
the
edge
of
the
garden
was
a
border
in
which
grew
all
manner
of
gay
and
flowers
there
were
asters
and
mignonette
and
convolvolus
heliotrope
and
fuchsias
then
in
front
of
me
was
the
pretty
cottage
with
two
gables
and
a
roof
the
walls
of
which
were
covered
from
top
to
bottom
with
creeping
plants
ivy
and
jessamine
climbing
roses
and
canariensis
all
helped
to
make
the
little
place
beautiful
a
pretty
home
you
have
little
jack
i
said
he
kept
tight
hold
of
my
hand
lest
i
should
escape
from
him
and
led
me
on
into
a
tiny
entrance
hall
past
one
or
two
doors
down
a
dark
passage
and
into
a
room
at
the
back
this
room
had
a
small
overlooking
the
sea
the
walls
were
covered
with
bookshelves
a
stood
in
the
window
and
in
the
corner
by
the
fireplace
was
the
extraordinary
object
i
had
been
brought
to
see
an
extremely
ancient
and
antiquated
what
a
peculiar
thing
to
come
across
in
a
preacher
study
what
possible
use
could
he
have
for
it
it
was
a
most
dilapidated
old
instrument
almost
falling
to
pieces
with
old
age
the
shape
was
so
that
i
do
not
remember
ever
having
seen
one
like
it
the
silk
which
had
doubtless
once
been
its
adornment
was
torn
into
shreds
and
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
its
original
colour
had
been
the
wood
was
and
decayed
and
the
leg
upon
which
it
had
rested
could
no
longer
support
its
weight
me
hear
you
play
it
jack
i
said
he
sat
down
with
great
pride
to
turn
the
handle
but
i
noticed
that
half
the
notes
were
broken
off
the
barrel
which
accounted
for
only
fragments
of
each
tune
being
heard
whilst
many
bars
of
some
were
wanting
altogether
however
jack
seemed
very
proud
of
his
performance
and
insisted
on
my
staying
till
he
had
gone
through
the
whole
of
the
four
tunes
which
the
poor
old
thing
was
supposed
to
play
he
announced
their
names
one
by
one
as
each
began
is
my
poor
mary
anne
jack
sad
then
when
that
was
finished
is
the
old
hundred
old
after
this
there
was
a
long
turning
of
the
handle
without
any
sound
being
heard
for
the
first
part
of
the
next
tune
was
gone
entirely
ca
say
the
name
of
this
one
jack
he
explained
calls
its
something
like
ma
says
the
marseillaise
i
said
laughing
right
little
man
i
know
that
comes
father
tune
father
like
it
so
listen
home
sweet
home
there
no
place
like
home
there
no
place
like
home
do
like
it
mr
jack
i
do
like
it
jack
i
said
knew
it
when
i
was
a
little
chap
like
you
as
he
played
once
more
it
brought
before
me
my
mother
voice
and
my
mother
words
i
had
not
thought
of
my
mother
for
years
so
much
as
i
had
done
at
runswick
bay
even
the
old
organ
brought
her
back
to
me
for
she
was
always
kind
to
there
was
an
italian
who
used
to
come
round
with
a
when
i
was
a
little
boy
i
can
see
him
now
i
used
to
watch
for
him
from
my
nursery
window
and
as
soon
as
he
came
in
sight
i
flew
down
to
my
mother
for
a
penny
and
then
went
into
the
garden
and
stood
beside
him
whilst
he
played
my
mother
gave
me
a
on
my
birthday
it
was
in
the
shape
of
a
and
had
a
strap
which
i
could
hang
round
my
neck
i
used
to
take
this
box
with
me
and
standing
beside
the
italian
i
imitated
his
every
movement
holding
my
little
organ
just
as
he
held
his
big
one
and
playing
beside
him
as
long
as
he
remained
so
delightful
did
this
man
occupation
seem
to
me
that
i
can
remember
quite
well
when
my
father
asked
me
one
day
what
i
would
like
to
be
when
i
was
a
man
i
answered
without
a
hesitation
of
course
father
those
old
boyish
days
how
long
ago
they
seemed
what
was
the
use
of
recalling
them
it
would
not
bring
back
the
mother
i
had
lost
or
the
father
who
had
cared
for
me
and
it
only
made
me
depressed
to
think
of
them
what
good
i
asked
myself
would
my
holiday
do
me
if
i
spent
it
in
brooding
over
bygone
sorrow
i
must
forget
all
this
kind
of
thing
and
cheer
up
and
get
back
my
spirits
again
little
jack
i
said
jack
must
go
back
to
his
picture
come
and
climb
into
the
old
boat
and
i
see
how
you
would
do
in
the
foreground
of
it
he
looked
such
a
merry
little
rogue
perched
amongst
the
nets
and
fishing
tackle
that
i
felt
i
should
improve
my
picture
by
introducing
him
into
it
and
therefore
from
that
day
he
came
for
a
certain
time
every
morning
to
be
painted
he
was
such
a
good
little
fellow
he
never
moved
a
limb
after
i
told
him
i
was
ready
and
never
spoke
unless
i
spoke
to
him
a
more
lovable
child
i
never
saw
nor
a
more
obedient
one
with
all
his
fun
and
in
spite
of
his
flow
of
spirits
he
was
checked
in
a
moment
by
a
single
word
no
one
could
be
dull
in
his
company
and
as
the
week
passed
on
i
began
to
regain
my
usual
cheerfulness
and
to
lose
the
uncomfortable
impression
left
on
my
mind
by
the
sermon
on
the
shore
and
the
questions
the
preacher
had
asked
us
illustration
chapter
vi
the
tug
of
war
i
had
quite
made
up
my
mind
not
to
attend
the
service
on
the
following
sunday
and
when
a
pink
paper
floated
down
on
my
easel
on
the
saturday
morning
i
caught
it
and
thrust
it
into
my
pocket
without
even
looking
to
see
what
the
subject
was
to
be
you
got
it
mr
jack
said
the
child
voice
above
me
right
little
man
i
answered
all
safe
and
sound
i
made
my
plans
for
sunday
with
great
care
i
asked
for
an
early
breakfast
so
that
i
might
walk
over
to
kettleness
a
place
about
two
miles
off
along
the
coast
and
which
could
only
be
reached
at
low
tide
and
when
i
was
once
there
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
i
determined
to
be
in
no
hurry
to
return
but
to
arrive
at
runswick
too
late
for
the
service
on
the
sands
if
duncan
and
polly
missed
me
they
would
simply
conclude
that
i
had
found
the
walk
longer
than
i
had
expected
but
as
i
was
just
ready
to
set
out
for
kettleness
a
tremendous
shower
came
on
never
set
off
in
this
weather
sir
said
duncan
anxiously
no
of
course
not
i
answered
lightly
i
fancied
that
he
looked
more
concerned
than
the
occasion
warranted
and
i
feared
that
he
suspected
the
real
reason
for
my
early
walk
there
was
now
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
wait
till
the
shower
was
over
and
by
that
time
i
found
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
go
to
kettleness
without
seeming
deliberately
to
avoid
the
service
the
sun
came
out
and
the
sky
was
quite
blue
before
eleven
and
the
fishermen
spread
tarpaulins
on
the
sand
for
the
congregation
to
sit
on
and
i
found
myself
i
must
say
very
much
against
my
will
being
led
to
the
place
by
little
jack
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
listen
i
said
to
myself
will
plan
out
a
new
picture
and
no
one
will
know
where
my
thoughts
are
but
in
spite
of
my
resolution
to
the
contrary
from
the
moment
that
jack
father
began
to
speak
my
attention
was
riveted
and
i
could
not
choose
but
listen
tug
of
war
is
our
subject
dear
friends
he
began
a
very
suitable
subject
i
think
after
what
we
have
witnessed
on
this
green
during
the
past
week
we
have
seen
have
we
not
a
long
pull
a
strong
pull
and
a
pull
all
together
as
yon
heavy
crab
boat
was
dragged
up
from
the
beach
how
well
she
came
what
progress
she
made
with
each
yoddel
we
brought
her
farther
from
the
sea
we
all
of
us
gave
a
helping
hand
fishermen
wives
visitors
friends
all
laid
hold
and
all
pulled
and
the
work
hard
as
it
seemed
was
soon
accomplished
why
because
we
were
all
united
it
was
a
long
pull
a
strong
pull
and
a
pull
all
together
now
let
me
bring
back
to
your
memory
another
event
during
this
past
week
the
place
is
the
same
our
village
green
the
same
rope
is
used
and
those
who
pull
are
the
very
same
men
strong
brawny
powerful
fishermen
yes
you
pulled
your
very
hardest
if
possible
you
put
forth
more
strength
than
when
the
crab
boat
was
drawn
up
and
yet
strange
to
say
there
was
no
result
the
rope
did
not
move
an
inch
what
were
you
pulling
what
was
the
mighty
weight
that
you
had
to
move
what
was
it
that
for
such
a
long
time
baffled
the
strength
of
the
strongest
among
you
the
weight
you
could
not
move
was
not
a
heavy
boat
but
a
light
handkerchief
was
there
this
difference
why
was
the
handkerchief
harder
to
move
than
the
boat
the
answer
to
that
question
was
to
be
found
at
the
other
end
of
the
green
there
were
other
pullers
at
the
rope
that
day
pulling
with
all
their
might
in
an
exactly
opposite
direction
it
was
not
a
united
pull
and
therefore
for
a
long
time
there
was
no
result
and
we
watched
on
until
at
length
one
side
was
proved
the
strongest
and
the
handkerchief
was
drawn
by
them
triumphantly
across
the
line
dear
friends
i
speak
to
you
of
yet
another
tug
of
war
the
place
is
the
same
runswick
bay
and
our
village
green
but
the
weight
to
be
drawn
is
not
a
boat
not
a
handkerchief
the
weight
is
human
it
is
your
soul
my
friend
your
immortal
soul
are
the
one
who
is
being
drawn
who
are
the
pullers
oh
how
many
they
are
i
myself
have
my
hands
on
the
rope
god
only
knows
how
hard
i
am
pulling
striving
with
all
my
might
if
possible
to
draw
you
my
friend
to
christ
but
there
are
other
hands
on
the
rope
besides
mine
your
conscience
pulls
your
good
old
mother
pulls
your
little
child
pulls
your
christian
mate
pulls
each
sermon
you
hear
each
bible
class
you
attend
each
hymn
you
sing
each
prayer
uttered
in
your
presence
each
striving
of
the
spirit
each
yearning
after
better
things
each
storm
you
come
through
each
danger
you
escape
each
sickness
in
your
family
each
death
in
your
home
each
deliverance
granted
you
gives
you
a
pull
oh
my
dear
friend
you
know
as
clearly
as
you
know
that
you
are
sitting
there
that
so
far
christ
pullers
are
drawing
in
vain
you
have
never
yet
you
know
it
crossed
the
line
which
divides
the
saved
from
the
unsaved
why
is
this
why
oh
why
are
you
so
hard
to
move
my
friend
do
you
ask
why
surely
you
know
the
reason
is
it
not
because
there
are
other
hands
on
the
rope
other
pullers
drawing
in
an
exactly
opposite
direction
for
satan
has
many
an
agent
many
a
servant
and
he
sends
forth
a
great
army
of
each
worldly
friend
each
desire
of
your
evil
nature
each
temptation
to
sin
each
longing
after
wealth
each
sinful
suggestion
gives
you
a
pull
and
a
pull
the
wrong
way
away
from
safety
away
from
christ
away
from
god
away
from
heaven
away
from
home
and
towards
what
oh
dear
friend
towards
what
what
are
the
depths
the
fearful
depths
towards
which
you
are
being
drawn
he
said
a
good
deal
more
but
i
did
not
hear
it
that
question
seemed
burnt
in
with
a
iron
into
my
soul
what
are
the
depths
the
fearful
depths
into
which
you
are
being
drawn
i
could
not
shake
it
off
i
wished
i
could
get
away
from
the
green
but
jack
had
brought
me
close
to
the
boat
where
the
choir
stood
and
there
was
no
escape
i
should
have
to
sit
it
out
it
would
soon
be
over
i
said
to
myself
the
service
ended
with
a
hymn
another
of
their
queer
wild
irregular
tunes
i
thought
i
was
not
going
to
sing
it
but
when
jack
saw
that
i
did
not
open
my
book
he
leant
over
the
side
of
the
boat
and
poked
my
head
with
his
big
jack
sing
he
said
aloud
and
then
for
very
shame
i
had
to
find
my
place
and
begin
i
can
still
remember
the
first
verse
of
that
hymn
and
i
think
i
can
recall
the
tune
to
which
they
sang
it
tender
and
sweet
was
the
master
voice
as
he
lovingly
called
to
me
come
over
the
line
it
is
only
a
step
i
am
waiting
my
child
for
thee
over
the
line
hear
the
sweet
refrain
angels
are
chanting
the
heavenly
strain
over
the
line
why
should
i
remain
with
a
step
between
me
and
jesus
i
was
heartily
glad
when
the
service
was
over
and
i
went
on
the
shore
at
once
to
try
to
walk
the
sermon
away
but
i
was
not
so
successful
as
i
had
been
the
sunday
before
that
question
followed
me
the
very
waves
seemed
to
be
repeating
it
what
are
the
depths
the
fearful
depths
to
which
you
are
being
drawn
i
had
not
looked
at
it
in
that
light
before
i
had
been
quite
willing
to
own
that
i
was
not
religious
that
i
was
leading
a
gay
kind
of
life
that
my
sundays
were
spent
in
bed
or
in
novel
reading
or
in
rowing
or
in
some
other
amusement
i
was
well
aware
that
i
looked
at
these
things
very
differently
from
what
my
mother
had
done
and
i
had
even
wondered
sometimes
whether
if
she
had
been
spared
to
me
i
should
have
been
a
better
fellow
than
i
knew
myself
to
be
but
as
for
feeling
any
real
alarm
or
anxiety
with
regard
to
my
condition
such
a
thought
had
never
for
one
moment
crossed
my
mind
yet
if
this
man
was
right
there
was
real
danger
in
my
position
i
was
not
remaining
stationary
as
i
had
thought
but
i
was
being
drawn
by
unseen
forces
towards
something
worse
towards
the
depths
the
fearful
depths
of
which
he
had
spoken
at
times
i
wished
i
had
never
come
to
runswick
bay
to
be
made
so
uncomfortable
at
other
times
i
wondered
if
i
had
been
brought
there
on
purpose
to
hear
those
words
i
went
back
to
dinner
but
i
could
not
enjoy
it
much
to
distress
the
rain
fell
fast
all
the
afternoon
and
as
i
lay
on
my
bed
upstairs
i
heard
polly
washing
up
and
singing
as
she
did
so
the
hymn
we
had
had
at
the
service
over
the
line
to
me
there
seemed
no
chance
of
forgetting
the
words
which
had
made
me
so
uneasy
that
night
i
had
a
strange
dream
i
thought
i
was
once
more
on
the
village
green
it
was
a
wild
stormy
night
the
wind
was
blowing
hard
and
the
rain
was
falling
fast
yet
through
the
darkness
i
could
distinguish
crowds
of
figures
gathered
on
the
green
on
the
side
farther
from
the
sea
there
was
a
bright
light
streaming
through
the
darkness
i
wondered
in
my
dream
what
was
going
on
and
i
found
that
it
was
a
tug
of
war
taking
place
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
i
saw
the
huge
cable
and
gradually
as
i
watched
i
caught
sight
of
those
who
were
pulling
i
walked
to
the
side
from
which
the
light
streamed
and
there
i
saw
a
number
of
holy
and
beautiful
angels
with
their
hands
on
the
rope
and
amongst
them
i
distinctly
caught
sight
of
my
mother
she
seemed
to
be
dragging
with
all
her
might
and
there
was
such
an
earnest
pleading
beseeching
expression
on
her
dear
face
that
it
went
to
my
very
heart
to
look
at
her
i
noticed
that
close
beside
her
was
the
preacher
little
jack
father
and
behind
him
was
duncan
they
were
all
intent
on
their
work
and
took
no
notice
of
me
so
i
walked
to
the
other
end
of
the
green
the
one
nearest
the
sea
that
i
might
see
who
were
there
it
was
very
dark
at
that
end
of
the
rope
but
i
could
dimly
see
evil
faces
and
dark
strange
forms
such
as
i
could
not
describe
those
on
this
side
seemed
to
be
having
it
much
their
own
way
i
thought
for
the
weight
whatever
it
was
was
gradually
drawing
near
to
the
sea
and
lo
and
behold
i
saw
that
they
were
close
upon
a
terrible
place
for
mighty
cliffs
stood
above
the
shore
and
they
were
within
a
very
short
distance
of
a
sheer
and
terrible
precipice
are
you
dragging
i
cried
to
them
and
a
thousand
voices
seemed
to
answer
soul
a
soul
then
as
i
watched
on
i
saw
that
the
precipice
was
nearly
reached
and
that
both
those
who
pulled
and
the
weight
they
were
dragging
were
on
the
point
of
being
hurled
over
and
suddenly
it
flashed
upon
me
in
my
dream
that
it
was
soul
for
which
they
were
struggling
and
i
heard
the
cry
of
the
pullers
from
the
other
side
of
the
green
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
with
one
voice
they
were
calling
out
that
terrible
question
are
the
depths
the
fearful
depths
to
which
you
are
being
drawn
and
through
the
streaming
light
i
saw
my
mother
face
and
a
look
of
anguish
crossed
it
as
suddenly
the
rope
broke
and
those
who
were
drawing
it
on
the
opposite
side
went
over
with
a
crash
dragging
my
soul
over
with
them
i
woke
in
a
terror
and
cried
out
so
loudly
that
duncan
came
running
into
my
room
to
see
what
was
the
matter
duncan
i
said
was
only
dreaming
i
thought
i
had
gone
over
a
precipice
thank
god
you
all
safe
sir
he
said
i
open
your
window
a
bit
maybe
the
room
close
is
it
you
duncan
i
answered
shall
be
all
right
now
i
so
sorry
i
have
waked
you
have
done
that
sir
me
and
polly
have
been
up
all
night
with
the
little
lad
he
sort
of
funny
too
sir
burning
hot
and
yet
he
shivers
like
and
he
clings
to
his
daddy
so
i
been
walking
a
mile
or
two
with
him
up
and
down
our
chamber
floor
and
i
heard
you
skriking
out
and
says
polly
run
and
see
what
ails
him
so
you
disturbed
me
sir
not
one
little
bit
you
have
he
left
me
then
and
i
tried
to
sleep
but
sleep
seemed
far
from
me
i
could
hear
duncan
footsteps
pacing
up
and
down
in
the
next
room
i
could
hear
little
john
fretful
cry
i
could
hear
the
rain
beating
against
the
casement
i
could
hear
the
soughing
and
whistling
of
the
wind
i
could
hear
polly
old
clock
striking
the
hours
and
the
of
that
long
dismal
night
but
through
it
all
and
above
it
all
i
could
hear
the
preacher
question
are
the
depths
the
fearful
depths
to
which
you
are
being
drawn
i
found
it
impossible
to
close
my
eyes
again
so
i
drew
up
the
blind
and
as
morning
began
to
dawn
i
watched
the
pitiless
rain
and
longed
for
day
the
footsteps
in
the
next
room
ceased
as
the
light
came
on
and
i
concluded
that
the
weary
child
was
at
last
asleep
i
wished
that
i
was
asleep
too
i
thought
how
often
my
mother
when
i
was
a
child
must
have
walked
up
and
down
through
long
weary
nights
with
me
i
wondered
whether
as
she
did
so
she
spent
the
slow
tedious
hours
in
praying
for
her
boy
and
then
i
wondered
how
she
would
have
felt
and
how
she
would
have
borne
it
had
she
known
that
the
child
in
her
arms
would
grow
up
to
manhood
living
for
this
world
and
not
for
the
christ
she
loved
i
wondered
if
she
know
this
now
in
the
land
where
she
dwelt
with
god
i
think
i
must
have
dozed
a
little
after
this
for
i
was
suddenly
roused
by
polly
cheery
voice
cheery
in
spite
of
her
bad
night
a
cup
of
tea
sir
it
do
you
good
you
not
slept
over
well
duncan
says
i
put
it
down
by
your
door
i
jumped
out
of
bed
and
brought
it
in
feeling
very
grateful
to
polly
and
i
drank
it
before
i
dressed
that
just
like
a
yorkshire
woman
i
thought
my
mother
came
from
yorkshire
think
it
must
have
been
nightmare
i
had
last
night
polly
i
said
as
i
finished
my
breakfast
and
began
to
put
all
in
order
for
my
work
illustration
chapter
vii
over
the
line
i
was
at
my
painting
early
the
next
morning
for
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
and
the
air
was
wonderfully
clear
my
portrait
of
little
jack
sitting
in
the
boat
promised
to
be
a
great
success
as
i
was
hard
at
work
upon
it
that
day
i
heard
a
voice
behind
me
never
thought
my
little
lad
would
figure
in
the
royal
academy
said
the
voice
it
was
the
voice
of
jack
father
the
voice
which
had
moved
me
so
deeply
the
voice
which
had
made
me
tremble
only
the
day
before
even
as
he
spoke
i
felt
inclined
to
run
away
lest
he
should
ask
me
again
that
terrible
question
which
had
been
ringing
in
my
ears
ever
since
even
as
i
talked
to
him
about
my
picture
and
even
as
he
answered
in
pleasant
and
friendly
tones
through
them
all
and
above
them
all
came
the
words
which
were
burnt
in
upon
my
memory
are
the
depths
the
fearful
depths
to
which
you
are
being
drawn
hope
my
children
are
not
troublesome
to
you
he
said
no
i
answered
love
to
have
them
here
and
jack
and
i
are
great
friends
do
you
know
i
went
on
took
me
into
your
study
the
other
day
i
am
afraid
i
was
taking
a
great
liberty
but
the
little
man
would
hear
of
no
refusal
he
wanted
me
to
see
the
old
my
dear
old
organ
he
answered
jack
is
nearly
as
fond
of
it
as
his
father
is
father
i
replied
for
it
seemed
strange
to
me
that
a
man
of
his
years
should
care
for
what
appeared
to
me
scarcely
better
than
a
broken
toy
organ
has
a
history
he
said
as
he
noticed
my
surprise
you
knew
the
history
you
would
not
wonder
that
i
love
it
i
owe
all
i
am
in
this
world
all
i
hope
to
be
in
the
world
to
come
to
that
poor
old
organ
some
day
when
you
have
time
to
listen
perhaps
you
may
like
to
hear
the
story
of
the
organ
you
i
said
sooner
the
better
come
and
have
supper
with
us
nellie
will
be
very
pleased
to
see
you
and
the
bairns
will
be
in
bed
and
we
shall
have
plenty
of
time
and
quiet
for
i
accepted
his
invitation
gratefully
for
september
had
come
and
the
evenings
were
growing
dark
and
my
time
hung
somewhat
heavily
on
my
hands
polly
i
think
was
not
sorry
when
she
heard
i
was
going
out
for
duncan
was
away
in
the
boat
fishing
and
little
john
was
so
feverish
and
restless
that
she
could
not
put
him
down
even
for
a
moment
the
cottage
looked
very
bright
and
pretty
when
i
arrived
and
they
gave
me
a
most
kind
welcome
a
small
fire
was
burning
in
the
grate
for
the
evenings
were
becoming
chilly
the
bow
window
was
hung
with
curtains
tied
up
with
amber
ribbon
the
walls
were
adorned
with
photographs
framed
in
oak
the
supper
table
was
covered
with
a
snowy
cloth
and
a
dainty
little
meal
was
laid
out
with
the
greatest
taste
and
care
whilst
in
the
centre
was
a
china
bowl
containing
the
leaves
of
the
creeper
which
covered
the
house
interspersed
with
yellow
bracken
and
other
beautiful
leaves
in
every
varied
shade
of
their
autumn
glory
jack
mother
was
evidently
a
woman
of
taste
she
had
a
quiet
gentle
face
almost
sad
at
times
when
it
was
at
rest
but
she
had
jack
eyes
and
jack
bright
smile
which
lighted
up
her
face
as
a
burst
of
brilliant
sunshine
will
stream
suddenly
down
a
dark
valley
and
make
it
a
perfect
avenue
of
light
i
enjoyed
the
company
of
both
husband
and
wife
exceedingly
and
as
we
sat
round
the
table
and
chatted
over
our
supper
all
feeling
of
constraint
passed
away
and
i
no
longer
heard
the
words
of
that
question
which
had
so
troubled
me
all
day
long
he
did
not
mention
the
object
for
which
i
had
come
whilst
the
meal
was
going
on
we
talked
of
runswick
bay
and
its
surroundings
of
the
fishermen
and
their
life
of
danger
we
spoke
of
the
children
and
of
my
picture
of
my
hopes
with
regard
to
the
royal
academy
and
of
many
other
interesting
topics
then
the
cloth
was
removed
and
we
drew
near
the
fire
i
had
just
said
to
him
for
your
story
and
he
was
just
beginning
to
tell
it
when
as
i
sat
down
in
an
which
nellie
had
placed
for
me
by
the
fire
my
eye
fell
upon
a
photograph
which
was
hanging
in
a
frame
close
to
the
fireplace
i
started
from
my
seat
and
looked
at
it
surely
i
could
not
be
mistaken
surely
i
knew
every
feature
of
it
every
fold
of
the
dress
every
tiny
detail
in
the
face
and
figure
it
was
the
counterpart
of
a
picture
which
hung
opposite
my
bed
in
my
london
home
on
earth
did
you
get
that
i
cried
it
my
picture
i
think
i
have
never
felt
more
startled
than
i
did
at
that
moment
after
all
the
thoughts
of
yesterday
after
my
dream
of
last
night
after
all
my
recollection
of
my
mother
words
to
me
and
her
prayers
for
me
after
all
this
to
see
her
dear
eyes
looking
at
me
from
the
wall
of
the
house
of
this
unknown
man
in
this
remote
spot
almost
frightened
me
i
did
not
realize
at
first
that
my
host
was
almost
as
much
startled
as
i
was
mother
he
repeated
mother
surely
not
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
he
said
laying
his
hand
on
my
arm
your
name
is
villiers
course
it
is
i
said
villiers
nellie
he
cried
for
she
had
gone
upstairs
to
the
children
down
at
once
who
do
you
think
this
is
nellie
you
will
never
guess
it
is
jack
villiers
the
little
jack
you
and
i
used
to
know
so
well
why
do
you
know
he
said
own
little
jack
was
named
after
you
he
was
indeed
and
we
have
heard
of
you
for
years
never
since
your
dear
mother
died
i
was
too
much
astonished
at
first
to
ask
him
any
questions
and
he
was
too
much
delighted
to
explain
where
and
how
he
had
known
me
but
after
a
time
when
we
had
recovered
ourselves
a
little
we
drew
our
chairs
round
the
fire
and
he
began
his
story
was
a
poor
little
street
arab
once
he
said
forlorn
boy
with
no
one
to
love
him
or
to
care
for
him
but
i
made
friends
with
an
old
man
in
the
attic
of
the
who
had
a
i
asked
very
same
he
said
he
loved
it
as
if
it
was
a
child
when
he
was
too
ill
to
take
it
out
himself
i
took
it
for
him
and
that
was
how
i
first
saw
your
mother
she
married
then
i
asked
he
said
with
a
smile
was
quite
a
little
girl
about
the
age
of
our
marjorie
she
used
to
run
to
her
nursery
window
as
soon
as
she
heard
me
begin
to
play
i
let
her
turn
the
organ
one
day
and
she
said
she
liked
all
the
tunes
but
she
liked
home
sweet
home
the
best
of
all
she
i
said
i
have
often
heard
her
sing
it
she
sang
me
to
sleep
with
it
many
a
time
i
played
it
he
went
on
would
speak
to
me
of
the
home
sweet
home
above
child
as
she
was
she
knew
the
way
to
that
home
and
she
soon
found
out
that
i
knew
nothing
about
it
you
ca
go
to
heaven
if
you
do
love
jesus
organ
boy
she
said
and
the
tears
ran
down
from
her
dear
little
eyes
as
she
said
it
could
not
forget
those
words
and
i
was
determined
to
find
out
the
way
to
the
home
of
which
she
spoke
old
master
was
dying
he
had
only
another
month
to
live
and
for
his
sake
i
must
learn
quickly
the
way
to
be
saved
i
attended
a
mission
service
and
i
learnt
first
that
no
sin
can
enter
the
gates
of
the
heavenly
city
but
i
learnt
more
i
learnt
that
the
blood
of
jesus
christ
god
son
cleanseth
from
all
sin
mother
taught
me
a
prayer
one
day
when
i
went
to
see
her
i
have
said
that
prayer
morning
and
evening
ever
since
she
gave
me
a
bunch
of
snowdrops
tied
up
with
dark
green
leaves
and
she
told
me
to
say
as
i
looked
at
them
wash
me
and
i
shall
be
whiter
than
snow
he
stopped
for
a
minute
or
two
after
this
and
gazed
into
the
fire
the
memory
of
those
old
days
had
stirred
him
deeply
go
on
i
said
for
i
longed
to
hear
more
came
to
our
attic
after
that
with
her
mother
they
came
to
see
my
old
master
and
she
was
pleased
to
see
the
snowdrops
she
told
me
that
day
that
if
i
would
only
say
her
prayer
i
should
be
sure
to
go
to
home
sweet
home
soon
after
this
my
old
master
died
and
on
the
very
day
that
i
was
following
him
to
the
grave
i
saw
my
poor
little
friend
your
mother
jack
in
a
funeral
coach
following
her
mother
to
the
same
place
then
after
that
she
went
abroad
but
she
did
not
forget
the
poor
organ
boy
she
told
her
father
about
me
and
he
sent
money
for
my
education
and
had
me
trained
to
be
a
city
missionary
in
the
east
of
london
to
work
amongst
the
very
people
amongst
whom
i
had
lived
all
i
am
now
i
owe
to
your
grandfather
did
not
meet
your
mother
after
this
for
many
years
not
until
she
was
married
to
the
clergyman
in
whose
parish
i
worked
to
say
we
met
one
day
in
my
old
attic
the
very
attic
where
my
poor
old
master
had
died
she
had
gone
there
to
visit
a
sick
woman
and
as
i
went
in
she
was
reading
to
her
from
the
very
testament
out
of
which
her
mother
had
read
to
my
old
master
when
she
had
come
to
see
him
in
that
place
fifteen
years
before
after
this
we
were
married
nellie
and
i
and
it
was
your
dear
mother
who
made
our
little
home
bright
and
pretty
for
us
and
who
was
there
to
welcome
us
to
it
how
we
loved
her
then
how
we
love
her
still
you
were
quite
a
tiny
child
she
would
bring
you
to
see
us
and
nellie
used
often
to
say
you
were
the
dearest
prettiest
child
she
had
ever
known
do
remember
it
i
said
you
would
be
too
young
to
remember
it
you
were
only
three
years
old
when
your
father
left
london
for
a
parish
in
the
country
and
soon
after
came
the
news
of
his
death
and
only
a
year
or
so
later
we
heard
your
mother
was
gone
too
it
was
a
sorrowful
day
jack
when
that
news
came
often
wondered
about
you
we
heard
that
you
had
gone
to
live
with
an
aunt
but
we
did
not
even
know
her
name
we
tried
to
find
out
more
but
we
knew
no
one
in
the
place
where
you
lived
and
we
never
heard
what
had
become
of
you
strange
that
i
should
have
been
brought
here
to
meet
you
i
said
not
strange
he
said
reverently
is
the
hand
of
god
and
then
i
could
not
help
it
i
laid
my
head
on
my
arm
as
i
stood
against
the
and
i
sobbed
like
a
child
he
did
not
speak
for
some
minutes
and
then
he
put
his
arm
round
me
as
tenderly
as
my
mother
could
have
done
and
said
is
it
jack
is
it
talking
of
your
mother
that
has
upset
you
so
i
said
is
that
i
love
to
talk
of
her
i
love
to
hear
of
her
everything
she
said
is
precious
to
me
it
is
that
then
he
said
troubles
you
jack
the
thought
that
i
shall
never
see
her
again
i
said
know
i
shall
not
went
one
way
and
am
going
another
not
turn
round
and
go
her
way
jack
he
said
cheerily
i
ca
i
said
no
use
i
ca
turn
there
are
too
many
hands
on
the
wrong
end
of
the
rope
i
been
miserable
ever
since
i
heard
you
talk
of
it
i
could
not
sleep
last
night
for
thinking
of
it
what
are
the
depths
the
fearful
depths
to
which
you
are
being
drawn
those
words
have
never
left
me
night
or
day
since
you
uttered
them
i
have
tried
to
shake
them
off
but
i
ca
attempt
to
shake
them
off
he
said
jack
do
try
to
do
it
for
they
are
the
voice
of
the
spirit
of
god
but
listen
to
the
one
who
is
calling
you
come
over
the
line
it
is
only
a
step
come
over
the
line
to
wish
i
could
i
said
can
do
it
and
you
do
it
jack
he
said
firmly
you
leave
this
room
i
leave
this
room
this
very
instant
he
said
how
can
i
do
it
i
do
know
how
to
cross
i
said
are
no
dead
lifeless
weight
on
the
rope
like
a
boat
or
a
handkerchief
you
have
a
will
of
your
own
and
it
remains
with
you
to
decide
which
way
you
want
to
be
drawn
or
to
the
fearful
depths
of
which
i
spoke
god
is
drawing
you
very
strongly
now
but
he
never
forces
a
man
against
his
will
he
puts
in
your
hands
the
power
to
decide
on
which
side
of
the
line
you
will
be
which
is
it
to
be
jack
i
said
will
think
it
over
many
have
said
and
their
desire
to
cross
the
line
has
cooled
down
and
they
have
been
lost
come
and
have
a
talk
with
you
another
day
later
on
in
the
week
if
we
can
make
it
convenient
felix
said
when
i
have
a
more
convenient
season
i
will
send
for
thee
but
felix
never
did
send
he
never
crossed
the
line
but
he
was
drawn
over
to
the
fearful
depths
suppose
we
say
it
late
now
and
you
tired
i
know
and
says
he
said
if
ye
will
hear
his
voice
harden
not
your
hearts
behold
now
is
the
accepted
time
now
is
the
day
of
salvation
me
i
can
come
i
said
come
over
the
line
to
there
you
have
it
he
answered
lord
calls
you
and
you
have
not
far
to
go
it
is
only
a
step
he
stands
in
this
room
close
to
you
he
holds
out
his
arms
to
you
he
does
not
compel
you
he
does
not
force
you
forward
he
calls
and
he
waits
to
receive
you
jack
will
you
come
i
will
i
said
earnestly
will
come
we
knelt
down
together
and
i
can
not
remember
the
words
he
said
but
i
know
that
whenever
i
read
in
the
gospels
those
words
in
the
first
chapter
of
john
brought
him
to
jesus
i
think
of
that
night
i
do
not
think
that
peter
and
andrew
felt
the
lord
jesus
more
near
them
in
the
booth
by
the
side
of
the
jordan
than
we
felt
him
in
that
little
room
in
runswick
bay
i
know
he
was
there
and
i
know
something
more
i
know
that
i
came
to
him
and
i
know
that
that
night
before
we
rose
from
our
knees
i
crossed
the
line
and
i
was
able
henceforth
to
take
my
place
amongst
the
glad
thankful
people
who
can
say
humbly
and
yet
confidently
know
that
we
have
passed
from
death
unto
life
chapter
viii
a
night
of
storm
it
was
late
when
i
got
back
to
my
lodging
and
i
walked
like
one
in
a
dream
polly
opened
the
door
and
she
seemed
troubled
about
the
child
little
john
was
evidently
in
pain
for
i
heard
him
moaning
as
i
went
upstairs
should
get
a
doctor
polly
i
said
duncan
says
sir
we
shall
have
to
send
for
him
in
the
morning
if
he
no
better
i
slept
calmly
and
peacefully
and
i
woke
up
to
feel
that
i
was
beginning
an
entirely
new
life
henceforth
i
was
not
my
own
i
was
standing
on
the
heavenward
side
of
the
line
and
i
had
taken
my
place
amongst
the
servants
of
christ
i
had
never
felt
so
happy
before
duncan
had
set
off
for
the
doctor
before
i
was
down
that
morning
little
john
was
better
polly
said
but
was
still
very
feverish
and
would
eat
nothing
she
brought
him
down
before
i
went
off
to
my
work
wrapped
in
a
shawl
and
i
thought
he
looked
very
ill
but
i
did
not
like
to
say
so
duncan
came
in
just
at
that
moment
and
the
child
put
out
his
arms
to
his
father
and
he
took
him
on
his
knee
by
the
fire
and
when
i
came
home
to
dinner
he
was
still
lying
there
the
doctor
been
i
asked
sir
he
was
out
when
i
called
this
morning
he
had
gone
to
a
bad
case
they
said
ten
miles
off
but
i
left
a
message
i
hope
he
come
before
i
go
this
evening
i
should
be
more
comfortable
like
if
he
did
however
the
evening
came
and
duncan
mates
were
whistling
for
him
from
the
shore
and
the
doctor
had
not
appeared
the
boy
was
still
in
his
father
arms
and
he
was
walking
up
and
down
the
kitchen
to
soothe
him
hard
to
leave
him
sir
he
said
when
he
heard
the
whistle
he
seems
a
bit
better
i
think
this
afternoon
he
has
cried
so
much
has
he
polly
but
i
saw
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
as
he
gave
the
boy
to
his
mother
walk
with
you
to
the
shore
duncan
i
said
for
i
saw
that
the
poor
fellow
was
very
downcast
you
kindly
sir
he
answered
i
stood
on
the
shore
whilst
the
nets
and
fishing
tackle
were
put
on
board
then
he
said
in
a
low
voice
a
comfort
to
feel
you
will
be
near
my
poor
lass
sir
it
cuts
me
to
the
heart
to
leave
her
if
anything
happens
to
little
john
whatever
would
me
and
my
missus
do
but
the
lord
knows
sir
he
knows
he
repeated
and
he
wiped
away
a
tear
which
fell
on
my
hand
as
he
grasped
it
i
went
back
to
duncan
house
to
find
the
doctor
there
it
was
influenza
and
pneumonia
he
said
and
the
boy
must
be
kept
in
one
room
he
was
a
very
silent
man
and
whether
he
thought
it
was
a
serious
case
or
not
i
could
not
discover
i
determined
not
to
go
to
bed
that
night
but
to
sit
up
in
my
room
in
case
i
should
be
of
any
use
i
was
really
glad
of
the
quiet
time
for
thought
and
prayer
i
am
ashamed
to
confess
that
i
had
brought
no
bible
with
me
to
runswick
bay
i
had
not
opened
a
bible
for
years
but
when
all
was
quiet
in
the
house
i
stole
quietly
downstairs
and
brought
up
duncan
bible
which
was
lying
on
the
top
of
the
oak
cupboard
below
what
a
bible
it
was
i
wondered
if
my
mother
bible
had
been
read
like
that
there
was
his
name
on
the
duncan
from
his
affectionate
father
it
had
evidently
been
given
to
him
when
a
boy
and
underneath
the
name
was
written
this
verse
thou
mine
eyes
that
i
may
behold
wondrous
things
out
of
thy
law
i
said
that
little
prayer
before
i
began
to
read
and
i
have
said
it
ever
since
each
time
that
i
have
opened
my
bible
about
twelve
that
night
the
weather
became
very
stormy
a
sudden
gale
set
in
and
in
a
very
short
time
the
sea
became
lashed
into
a
fury
i
have
never
heard
wind
like
the
wind
that
night
it
literally
shrieked
and
moaned
as
it
blew
and
every
window
and
door
in
the
house
rattled
and
sometimes
i
felt
as
if
the
cottage
itself
would
be
swept
away
a
time
they
must
be
having
out
at
sea
i
said
to
myself
i
went
to
the
window
and
putting
out
my
candle
i
tried
to
see
out
into
the
darkness
but
i
could
distinguish
nothing
whatever
so
black
was
the
sky
and
so
tremendous
was
the
rain
it
must
have
been
about
one
that
i
heard
a
step
on
the
stairs
i
opened
my
door
and
went
out
it
was
polly
is
he
polly
i
asked
bad
sir
very
bad
she
said
does
know
me
now
and
he
wo
take
anything
and
oh
sir
do
you
hear
the
wind
who
could
help
hearing
it
it
was
raging
more
furiously
every
moment
and
the
house
seemed
to
rock
with
the
violence
of
the
storm
me
help
you
polly
i
said
me
come
and
sit
with
you
beside
little
john
sir
if
you
would
just
stay
a
few
minutes
whilst
i
fetch
betty
green
she
said
feel
as
if
i
durs
be
alone
any
longer
getting
that
nervous
what
with
little
john
talking
so
queer
sir
and
the
wind
blowing
so
awful
and
his
father
on
the
sea
and
polly
burst
into
tears
i
said
is
on
the
sea
as
well
as
on
the
land
go
and
fetch
betty
and
i
will
sit
by
the
child
she
went
down
and
opened
the
door
and
the
wind
rushed
into
the
house
and
up
the
stairs
and
i
had
to
shut
the
bedroom
door
hastily
to
keep
it
out
then
i
heard
polly
pulling
and
pulling
at
it
and
vainly
trying
to
shut
it
and
i
had
to
go
down
to
help
her
she
was
some
minutes
away
for
she
had
difficulty
in
rousing
her
neighbour
and
i
sat
beside
the
unconscious
child
he
was
talking
the
whole
time
but
i
could
distinguish
very
little
of
what
he
said
it
seemed
to
be
chiefly
about
going
with
his
daddy
in
his
boat
and
every
now
and
then
he
would
call
out
quite
loudly
daddy
come
daddy
to
little
john
when
polly
returned
with
old
betty
i
had
again
to
go
down
to
help
them
to
close
the
door
do
you
think
of
him
sir
said
polly
i
did
not
like
to
say
what
i
thought
so
i
answered
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
to
get
the
doctor
to
have
another
look
at
him
i
go
for
him
if
you
like
do
believe
you
could
manage
it
sir
said
betty
ca
stand
outside
me
and
polly
has
been
clinging
on
to
the
palings
all
the
way
and
it
will
be
terrible
up
on
the
top
i
try
polly
she
gave
me
a
grateful
look
but
did
not
answer
by
words
but
the
two
women
gave
me
so
long
a
description
of
the
way
to
the
doctor
house
and
interrupted
each
other
so
often
and
at
length
both
talked
together
in
their
eagerness
to
make
it
clear
to
me
that
at
the
end
i
was
more
bewildered
and
hopelessly
puzzled
than
at
the
beginning
and
i
determined
to
go
to
christie
before
i
started
in
order
to
obtain
from
him
full
and
clear
directions
it
took
me
quite
ten
minutes
to
reach
his
house
and
i
felt
as
if
i
had
gone
through
a
battle
when
i
arrived
there
at
length
quite
spent
and
breathless
i
saw
a
light
in
the
lower
room
and
i
found
christie
and
his
wife
and
children
sitting
in
the
room
where
i
had
passed
through
so
much
the
night
before
marjorie
and
little
jack
were
in
their
nightgowns
wrapped
in
a
blanket
and
sitting
in
the
same
my
mother
picture
was
looking
at
me
from
the
wall
and
i
fancied
that
she
smiled
at
me
as
i
came
in
a
terrible
night
said
christie
children
were
so
frightened
by
the
noise
of
the
wind
in
their
attic
that
we
brought
them
down
here
i
told
them
my
errand
and
christie
at
once
offered
to
go
with
me
for
the
doctor
i
shall
never
forget
that
walk
as
long
as
i
live
we
could
not
speak
to
each
other
more
than
a
few
necessary
words
we
were
simply
fighting
with
the
storm
then
to
our
disappointment
when
our
long
walk
was
ended
we
found
that
the
doctor
was
away
and
would
probably
not
return
until
morning
the
walk
home
was
if
possible
worse
than
the
walk
there
for
the
wind
was
dead
against
us
as
we
came
down
the
cliff
it
had
changed
somewhat
the
last
hour
and
was
now
blowing
from
the
will
be
trouble
out
at
sea
christie
said
as
we
stopped
to
take
breath
what
about
the
boats
i
asked
he
said
almost
with
a
groan
about
the
boats
we
could
see
very
little
out
at
sea
though
it
was
beginning
to
grow
light
but
we
determined
to
make
our
way
to
the
shore
to
see
all
that
it
was
possible
to
distinguish
he
went
home
for
a
moment
and
then
followed
me
to
my
lodging
polly
and
her
old
friend
were
still
watching
the
child
think
he
a
little
better
sir
she
said
quieter
oh
christie
i
glad
to
see
you
sir
will
you
pray
sir
i
think
i
shall
hear
the
wind
less
if
you
pray
we
knelt
down
beside
the
child
bed
but
the
noise
of
the
storm
almost
drowned
his
voice
at
the
end
of
the
prayer
the
child
began
once
more
to
cry
for
his
father
so
piteously
so
beseechingly
that
at
last
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
but
ran
downstairs
to
be
out
of
the
sound
of
that
touching
little
voice
christie
soon
followed
me
and
we
went
out
together
in
the
grey
light
of
that
terrible
morning
child
is
dying
jack
he
said
do
say
so
mr
christie
i
answered
before
his
father
comes
back
grant
he
come
back
he
said
at
the
sea
jack
the
sea
was
dashing
wildly
against
the
rocks
and
the
noise
of
the
wind
was
so
great
we
could
hardly
hear
our
own
voices
in
the
dim
uncertain
light
we
could
at
length
distinguish
a
group
of
anxious
watchers
on
the
shore
some
old
fishermen
were
there
trying
to
hold
a
telescope
steady
in
the
gale
that
they
might
look
across
the
water
for
any
sign
of
a
boat
and
mothers
and
wives
and
sweethearts
of
the
absent
fishermen
were
there
also
with
shawls
tied
over
their
heads
and
with
troubled
and
faces
peering
out
into
the
dismal
light
of
that
sorrowful
morning
christie
and
i
stood
near
them
and
he
spoke
from
time
to
time
a
word
of
encouragement
and
hope
to
the
anxious
women
beside
him
as
the
light
increased
the
wind
dropped
somewhat
and
the
gale
seemed
to
have
spent
its
violence
we
were
thankful
to
notice
that
although
the
sea
was
still
very
rough
and
would
be
so
for
hours
the
wind
was
gradually
subsiding
instead
of
howling
and
shrieking
as
it
had
done
the
whole
night
long
it
was
dying
away
with
gentle
moans
like
a
child
weary
with
passion
who
is
crying
himself
to
sleep
but
still
there
was
no
sign
of
the
boats
the
women
on
the
shore
were
wet
through
and
christie
tried
to
persuade
them
to
go
home
their
men
would
want
good
fires
and
hot
tea
on
their
return
he
told
them
and
they
ought
to
make
ready
for
them
i
was
glad
to
notice
that
one
by
one
they
followed
his
advice
and
turned
to
climb
the
hill
towards
their
cottages
then
we
turned
also
and
went
back
to
my
lodging
we
crept
into
the
room
and
found
old
betty
asleep
in
her
chair
and
polly
holding
the
little
hand
in
hers
as
the
child
slept
the
boats
come
sir
she
said
as
we
went
in
yet
polly
but
please
god
they
will
come
soon
we
sat
down
beside
her
for
a
little
time
but
we
presently
heard
a
shout
from
the
shore
god
said
polly
come
the
child
seemed
in
some
strange
way
to
have
heard
that
shout
and
to
have
understood
its
meaning
for
he
opened
his
eyes
and
said
daddy
come
to
little
john
we
hurried
down
to
the
shore
where
a
large
crowd
had
already
collected
the
whole
of
runswick
bay
seemed
to
have
gathered
together
in
that
short
space
of
time
we
could
distinctly
see
the
boats
far
out
at
sea
but
wind
and
tide
were
with
them
and
they
were
coming
rapidly
nearer
what
a
night
they
must
have
had
and
what
a
welcome
they
would
receive
from
the
watchers
on
the
shore
many
boats
went
out
last
night
bob
said
one
man
as
they
drew
nearer
was
eight

he
said
jane

i
felt
that
i
knew
which
it
was
before
they
came
in
sight
it
was
the
mary
ann
illustration
illustration
chapter
ix
ask
what
ye
will
we
had
run
down
the
hill
as
quickly
as
we
possibly
could
but
we
were
in
no
haste
to
return
we
waited
until
the
boats
were
drawn
in
and
the
fishermen
had
come
on
shore
they
knew
nothing
of
the
mary
ann
they
had
lost
sight
of
her
soon
after
the
beginning
of
the
gale
they
told
us
they
had
had
an
awful
night
and
had
thought
they
would
never
reach
home
in
safety
shall
we
tell
polly
i
groaned
but
a
cold
hand
was
laid
on
mine
at
that
instant
and
i
turned
round
to
see
polly
herself
just
behind
me
she
could
wait
no
longer
but
had
run
down
to
the
shore
to
hasten
her
husband
up
the
hill
she
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
and
seemed
ready
to
faint
the
fishermen
crowded
round
her
with
words
of
cheer
and
comfort
be
all
right
my
lass
never
fear
he
put
into
saltburn
or
staithes
maybe
these
gales
they
drive
so
far
he
be
home
all
safe
and
sound
afore
night
but
polly
did
not
seem
to
hear
them
she
stretched
out
her
hands
feebly
to
christie
and
to
me
as
she
said
me
home
i
can
bear
it
better
there
the
fishermen
turned
away
sorrowfully
and
there
were
very
few
dry
eyes
amongst
the
group
which
we
left
on
the
shore
when
we
reached
the
house
again
all
was
quite
still
and
as
we
entered
the
bedroom
i
thought
the
little
soul
had
passed
away
but
i
bent
over
him
to
listen
and
to
my
relief
i
found
he
was
still
breathing
as
i
look
back
i
hardly
know
how
we
lived
through
that
sorrowful
day
the
doctor
came
and
did
nothing
but
shake
his
head
in
the
ominous
way
which
doctors
have
when
they
feel
a
case
is
beyond
their
power
i
think
polly
had
so
little
hope
herself
that
she
did
not
care
to
ask
him
what
his
real
opinion
was
i
went
out
for
a
short
walk
in
the
afternoon
to
get
a
little
fresh
air
to
strengthen
me
for
the
coming
night
when
i
had
determined
to
watch
with
polly
beside
little
john
if
he
was
still
living
my
young
friends
bob
and
harry
joined
me
and
we
were
pacing
up
and
down
together
watching
the
tide
come
in
when
we
thought
we
saw
a
dark
speck
far
out
to
sea
there
were
others
who
saw
it
also
the
coastguard
was
looking
at
it
through
his
telescope
and
before
very
long
the
shore
was
covered
with
fishermen
and
their
wives
all
gazing
in
the
same
direction
whatever
the
object
was
it
was
coming
rapidly
shoreward
wind
and
tide
were
both
with
it
and
it
was
being
borne
swiftly
along
after
a
little
time
we
could
distinguish
even
without
the
help
of
a
telescope
what
it
was
and
i
do
not
think
there
was
anything
which
we
could
have
been
more
aghast
to
see
for
the
floating
object
was
a
boat
bottom
upwards
and
being
driven
rapidly
before
the
tide
a
groan
came
from
the
group
of
fishermen
who
were
watching
and
as
the
capsized
boat
neared
shore
they
ran
into
the
water
to
meet
it
i
do
not
think
it
was
necessary
to
look
at
the
name
upon
it
as
it
was
dragged
out
of
the
water
we
all
did
look
however
and
we
found
there
the
name
which
we
knew
we
should
see
before
we
looked
it
was
the
mary
ann
i
shall
never
forget
the
piercing
shriek
which
came
from
the
wife
of
one
of
duncan
mates
who
was
standing
just
behind
me
when
she
read
the
name
on
the
boat
i
thought
the
shock
and
the
sorrow
had
driven
her
mad
for
she
ran
screaming
up
the
hill
indeed
i
firmly
believe
that
for
the
time
she
was
quite
out
of
her
mind
poor
polly
heard
the
shrieks
of
the
woman
as
she
ran
under
her
window
and
looking
out
she
saw
the
boat
on
the
shore
and
guessed
the
truth
at
once
did
not
scream
nor
cry
but
she
looked
as
if
she
had
been
turned
into
stone
no
word
escaped
her
lips
not
a
tear
was
in
her
eye
but
she
looked
as
if
all
her
youth
had
gone
in
a
moment
and
as
if
she
had
suddenly
become
an
old
and
woman
she
never
looked
up
as
we
went
in
but
bent
over
little
john
moistening
his
lips
from
time
to
time
and
watching
his
every
movement
we
tried
to
say
a
few
words
of
comfort
but
she
did
not
seem
even
to
hear
our
voices
yet
no
moan
no
sigh
from
the
child
was
unheard
by
her
she
seemed
to
be
listening
to
every
breath
he
drew
as
if
it
might
be
his
last
i
thought
that
terrible
day
would
never
have
an
end
christie
stayed
with
us
until
dark
and
then
he
took
me
home
with
him
to
supper
that
i
might
get
a
little
change
and
rest
before
my
night
watch
i
think
they
knew
how
tired
i
was
worn
out
more
by
feeling
than
by
want
of
sleep
and
they
were
very
good
to
me
i
do
not
think
my
own
mother
could
have
been
more
kind
to
me
than
christie
was
that
night
she
told
me
that
she
would
have
had
a
boy
nearly
as
old
as
i
was
if
he
had
lived
but
he
had
died
when
he
was
very
young
and
then
they
had
had
no
children
for
many
years
not
until
marjorie
was
born
mother
was
so
good
to
me
when
my
baby
died
she
said
thought
i
should
never
be
happy
again
but
she
came
and
talked
to
me
and
made
me
look
from
my
sorrow
to
my
little
boy
gain
and
i
think
her
kindness
to
me
and
the
loving
words
she
spoke
made
me
love
her
more
than
ever
i
felt
much
better
for
the
good
supper
and
for
the
kind
words
of
these
dear
people
and
i
went
back
determined
to
do
all
i
could
for
poor
polly
and
her
child
through
that
sorrowful
night
i
felt
so
grateful
to
the
lord
jesus
christ
for
all
he
had
done
for
me
and
i
was
very
glad
to
be
able
to
do
any
little
thing
to
show
my
love
to
him
it
seemed
to
me
then
and
it
seems
to
me
still
that
the
way
in
which
we
can
please
him
best
is
by
showing
kindness
to
his
children
i
remembered
a
verse
about
a
cup
of
cold
water
being
noticed
by
him
if
given
for
his
sake
and
i
thought
to
myself
is
not
in
need
of
cold
water
for
she
is
too
cold
already
but
i
might
make
her
a
cup
of
tea
the
fire
was
out
and
the
little
kitchen
which
was
usually
so
neat
was
all
in
confusion
i
lighted
the
lamp
that
i
might
see
what
i
was
about
and
then
i
tried
to
put
the
little
place
in
order
first
i
found
sticks
and
coal
and
lighted
a
fire
then
whilst
my
fire
was
burning
up
i
cleared
the
table
carried
the
dirty
plates
and
cups
into
the
small
back
kitchen
found
a
tablecloth
and
a
clean
cup
and
saucer
and
filled
the
kettle
as
soon
as
the
fire
was
hot
enough
i
put
the
kettle
on
and
cutting
a
slice
from
the
loaf
i
made
some
nice
crisp
toast
such
as
my
aunt
used
to
like
when
she
was
then
i
heated
a
plate
and
buttered
the
toast
and
set
it
down
by
the
fire
by
this
time
the
kettle
was
boiling
and
i
made
the
tea
and
i
said
in
my
heart
when
all
was
finished
jesus
i
do
this
for
thee
then
i
went
upstairs
to
my
hardest
task
of
all
namely
to
persuade
polly
to
come
down
to
eat
the
little
meal
i
had
prepared
polly
was
as
i
had
expected
most
unwilling
to
leave
the
child
and
at
first
she
firmly
declined
to
move
and
would
not
listen
to
my
pleading
words
yet
i
could
see
that
she
was
almost
fainting
and
i
knew
that
she
would
need
all
the
strength
that
she
could
muster
for
the
night
which
lay
before
us
who
knew
what
that
night
would
bring
i
therefore
spoke
to
her
very
firmly
telling
her
that
i
was
willing
and
anxious
to
help
her
in
her
trouble
but
that
if
i
was
to
be
any
use
to
her
she
must
not
refuse
to
go
downstairs
for
a
few
minutes
at
least
and
i
promised
her
to
watch
little
john
very
carefully
and
to
call
her
at
once
if
i
saw
any
change
in
the
child
she
obeyed
me
at
last
and
i
heard
her
weary
footsteps
descending
the
steep
stairs
when
i
was
left
alone
i
saw
that
polly
bible
was
lying
open
by
the
little
which
stood
on
the
table
upon
which
had
been
placed
the
medicine
and
milk
for
little
john
use
i
went
up
to
it
and
my
eye
fell
upon
these
words
ye
abide
in
me
and
my
words
abide
in
you
ye
shall
ask
ye
and
shall
be
done
unto
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
that
verse
was
god
direct
message
to
me
that
night
i
saw
it
as
clearly
and
distinctly
as
if
the
page
had
been
lighted
with
electric
light
conditions
and
a
promise
i
said
to
myself
only
the
conditions
are
fulfilled
the
promise
is
sure
what
are
the
two
conditions
ye
abide
in
me
i
asked
myself
if
i
was
fulfilling
condition
i
humbly
hoped
i
was
for
oh
i
longed
to
be
in
christ
saved
by
him
more
than
i
longed
for
anything
else
in
this
world
my
words
abide
in
you
was
i
fulfilling
the
second
condition
again
i
humbly
hoped
that
i
was
for
i
felt
that
if
christ
told
me
to
go
to
the
north
pole
or
to
an
african
desert
i
would
obey
gladly
i
would
go
anywhere
i
would
do
anything
to
show
him
how
grateful
i
was
for
his
love
to
me
then
might
i
claim
the
promise
i
believed
that
i
might
i
laid
polly
bible
on
the
bed
i
knelt
down
beside
little
john
i
put
my
finger
on
the
promise
and
i
prayed
as
i
had
never
prayed
before
for
help
in
this
time
of
need
i
felt
very
strongly
that
all
power
was
in
the
hands
of
christ
and
that
he
who
healed
the
sick
on
earth
had
lost
none
of
his
power
now
that
he
was
exalted
to
the
throne
of
god
i
besought
him
to
come
into
that
room
that
very
night
and
to
touch
and
heal
little
john
and
as
i
rose
from
my
knees
i
felt
that
my
prayer
was
heard
polly
had
not
returned
so
i
went
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
listened
and
i
heard
the
sound
of
sobbing
i
was
thankful
to
hear
it
the
tears
had
come
at
last
and
they
would
relieve
the
poor
weary
heart
little
john
was
very
quiet
so
i
crept
downstairs
i
found
to
my
joy
that
polly
had
eaten
most
of
the
toast
and
had
drunk
the
tea
and
now
she
was
sitting
with
her
feet
on
the
fender
and
her
head
in
her
hands
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
what
was
it
that
had
brought
the
tears
she
had
not
cried
when
the
empty
boat
had
come
ashore
she
had
shed
no
tear
when
the
doctor
face
had
told
her
that
he
had
no
hope
for
the
child
what
was
it
that
had
helped
her
to
give
way
to
the
tears
which
were
such
a
relief
to
her
it
was
a
very
simple
thing
she
had
picked
up
from
the
floor
a
little
toy
a
tiny
boat
which
duncan
had
made
for
the
child
and
which
had
been
little
john
greatest
treasure
there
had
come
over
her
such
a
rush
of
memories
of
the
happy
days
of
the
past
gone
as
she
believed
for
ever
of
the
father
whose
fingers
had
so
busily
carved
the
boat
for
his
boy
but
who
would
never
come
back
to
her
again
and
of
the
little
lad
passing
away
from
her
also
and
leaving
his
treasured
toy
behind
him
all
these
sad
but
lovely
memories
came
before
her
as
she
took
up
the
little
boat
and
pressed
it
to
her
lips
they
came
so
strongly
and
with
such
power
that
the
tears
which
had
refused
to
come
before
came
with
them
and
brought
as
i
felt
sure
they
would
wonderful
relief
to
her
heart
i
said
up
do
lose
heart
i
believe
little
john
will
recover
you
sir
thank
you
she
said
as
she
dried
her
eyes
feel
better
now
a
deal
better
i
do
you
been
good
to
me
sir
i
go
up
again
to
him
now
right
polly
i
said
make
up
the
fire
and
then
i
come
and
help
you
he
asleep
now
polly
creep
quietly
up
then
sir
she
said
and
i
saw
as
she
rose
to
go
that
the
stony
look
had
gone
out
of
her
face
and
that
she
was
herself
again
that
sleep
lasted
for
hours
it
was
a
quiet
night
the
wind
had
quite
gone
down
and
everything
seemed
more
still
after
the
tumult
of
the
previous
night
i
was
glad
to
see
that
polly
herself
at
length
fell
asleep
in
her
chair
little
john
hand
lay
in
hers
and
i
knew
she
would
wake
with
his
least
movement
but
i
was
pleased
to
see
it
for
i
felt
sure
that
even
a
light
sleep
would
soothe
and
strengthen
her
i
had
just
looked
at
my
watch
and
had
seen
that
it
was
nearly
two
when
i
thought
i
heard
footsteps
outside
and
a
moment
afterwards
there
came
a
gentle
knock
at
the
door
it
seemed
a
strange
time
for
a
visitor
but
i
thought
probably
it
was
some
neighbour
come
to
offer
to
help
polly
in
her
long
night
watch
or
perhaps
it
was
christie
come
to
see
how
we
were
getting
on
i
crept
softly
downstairs
lest
either
polly
or
the
child
should
wake
and
carefully
unfastening
the
bolts
i
opened
the
door
i
nearly
yelled
with
joy
when
i
saw
who
was
standing
there
never
in
all
my
life
have
i
been
more
glad
to
see
any
man
than
i
was
that
night
to
see
duncan
alive
and
uninjured
whilst
all
day
long
i
had
been
picturing
him
being
driven
backwards
and
forwards
by
the
waves
a
drowned
corpse
at
the
mercy
of
the
relentless
sea
he
grasped
my
hand
and
came
in
to
the
fire
but
at
first
he
could
not
speak
he
said
at
last
in
a
broken
voice
i
too
late
tell
me
the
truth
sir
do
hide
it
over
like
is
little
john
dead
duncan
i
said
still
lives
and
he
is
asleep
and
duncan
i
believe
he
will
be
given
back
to
you
god
he
said
god
for
that
for
just
a
moment
a
doubt
crossed
my
mind
as
to
whether
i
ought
to
give
him
this
hope
and
yet
i
rebuked
myself
for
this
doubt
for
i
was
clinging
to
the
promise
and
the
word
of
the
lord
was
sure
and
i
believed
that
if
what
i
asked
was
good
for
these
poor
souls
it
be
granted
to
me
duncan
had
now
sat
down
in
his
and
by
the
light
of
the
fire
i
could
see
that
he
was
faint
and
exhausted
he
leant
back
wearily
for
some
time
and
seemed
unable
to
speak
i
had
left
the
kettle
on
the
fire
and
i
hastened
to
give
him
a
cup
of
tea
and
something
to
eat
then
i
crept
upstairs
to
see
what
was
going
on
but
finding
polly
and
little
john
were
still
both
fast
asleep
i
came
back
to
him
he
was
better
for
the
tea
and
able
to
talk
to
me
had
an
awful
time
sir
he
said
in
answer
to
my
inquiry
and
many
the
time
since
i
was
a
boy
that
i
been
near
the
dark
valley
but
this
time
why
i
think
i
been
down
it
sir
how
my
poor
lass
sir
cut
up
duncan
i
said
thinks
you
are
dead
your
boat
came
up
with
last
night
tide
polly
poor
lass
he
said
go
to
her
a
little
duncan
i
said
is
asleep
now
and
she
will
bear
the
joy
better
when
she
wakes
my
little
lad
he
asked
too
duncan
so
peacefully
and
quietly
it
hard
not
to
go
up
sir
but
may
be
you
right
he
waited
very
patiently
for
an
hour
and
when
i
crept
up
again
at
the
end
of
that
time
polly
and
the
child
were
both
awake
and
she
was
giving
him
some
milk
little
john
was
quite
conscious
and
looked
more
like
himself
than
he
had
done
since
his
illness
began
he
had
no
sooner
finished
his
milk
however
than
he
began
his
old
weary
cry
daddy
come
to
little
john
polly
burst
into
tears
again
when
she
heard
him
calling
for
the
father
whom
she
believed
to
be
dead
but
i
bent
over
the
child
and
said
little
john
daddy
will
come
to
you
i
believe
polly
fancied
that
i
thought
the
child
was
dying
and
that
i
meant
his
father
spirit
was
coming
to
fetch
him
for
she
only
cried
the
more
bitterly
and
said
little
john
little
john
but
when
i
added
i
fetch
daddy
little
john
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
looked
at
me
wildly
but
without
speaking
a
word
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
say
more
for
she
heard
the
sound
of
a
footstep
on
the
stairs
and
in
another
moment
she
was
in
her
husband
arms
i
felt
then
that
my
work
was
over
and
that
the
best
thing
that
i
could
do
would
be
to
go
to
bed
but
i
glanced
back
from
the
door
as
i
went
out
and
i
saw
the
little
hands
held
out
and
i
heard
duncan
sob
like
a
child
as
he
cried
my
little
lad
my
own
little
john
i
never
thought
to
see
you
again
illustration
chapter
x
we
know
the
next
day
duncan
was
able
to
tell
me
what
he
had
passed
through
during
that
terrible
night
it
seems
he
was
separated
from
the
other
boats
by
the
very
first
outburst
of
the
gale
and
never
saw
them
again
through
the
long
hours
of
that
night
of
storm
for
some
considerable
time
he
and
his
mates
by
straining
every
nerve
were
able
to
keep
the
water
out
of
their
boat
but
as
the
night
went
on
and
the
sea
grew
rougher
and
the
waves
seemed
mountains
high
they
were
compelled
at
last
to
own
that
their
attempt
was
hopeless
that
time
said
duncan
just
trusted
my
soul
again
to
christ
for
i
expected
the
next
wave
would
sweep
us
to
the
bottom
i
frightened
sir
did
you
say
no
i
think
not
i
felt
more
awed
like
if
you
understand
and
in
them
few
moments
all
sorts
of
thoughts
seemed
to
be
running
through
my
head
but
through
them
all
was
the
thought
of
my
poor
lass
of
polly
and
little
john
yes
sir
of
polly
and
little
john
and
i
cried
to
him
as
alone
could
help
me
o
god
i
said
save
me
for
polly
and
little
john
want
me
so
bad
and
he
heard
my
prayer
sir
i
often
thought
how
them
fishermen
cried
to
him
in
the
storm
that
day
master
save
us
we
perish
they
said
and
he
heard
their
cry
did
he
sir
and
he
heard
mine
yes
he
heard
mine
for
when
the
wave
did
come
which
carried
us
over
the
mary
ann
was
driven
right
past
where
we
were
struggling
in
the
water
and
we
caught
hold
on
her
we
clung
on
for
dear
life
sir
but
we
could
have
clung
there
many
minutes
for
the
sea
was
that
cold
and
icy
our
hands
was
frozen
but
god
almighty
knew
how
to
save
us
and
he
sent
a
steamer
to
pick
us
up
in
less
than
ten
minutes
after
we
went
overboard
and
they
good
to
us
sir
for
all
they
were
foreign
folk
aboard
they
warmed
us
and
gave
us
hot
coffee
and
lent
us
dry
clothes
and
they
ran
into
the
hull
docks
in
the
afternoon
and
landed
us
there
well
sir
you
may
be
sure
i
came
home
as
quick
as
ever
i
could
for
i
thought
maybe
i
should
never
see
my
little
lad
again
has
god
been
good
to
us
now
has
he
sir
he
concluded
as
he
gently
patted
his
little
boy
hand
the
doctor
gave
a
much
better
report
of
little
john
that
day
although
he
said
he
was
not
yet
out
of
danger
but
from
that
time
he
improved
slowly
but
steadily
and
before
very
long
he
was
able
to
lie
once
more
in
his
father
arms
and
to
stroke
his
face
with
his
little
thin
hand
it
was
very
touching
to
see
the
love
and
the
gratitude
of
both
duncan
and
polly
they
could
not
say
enough
about
the
help
and
comfort
i
had
given
them
in
their
time
of
trouble
small
though
i
felt
these
to
have
been
if
i
had
been
a
prince
i
think
they
could
not
have
made
more
of
me
and
i
believe
i
should
have
been
altogether
spoiled
if
i
had
stayed
in
runswick
bay
much
longer
i
had
not
touched
my
picture
the
whole
of
that
week
for
whilst
our
anxiety
lasted
i
had
no
heart
or
desire
to
paint
on
saturday
i
saw
marjorie
and
little
jack
giving
out
their
pink
papers
and
i
went
to
meet
them
for
you
big
jack
said
the
merry
little
rogue
as
he
threw
it
up
in
the
air
for
me
to
catch
the
subject
for
the
following
day
i
saw
was
to
be
these
two
words
we
know
i
thought
as
i
put
the
paper
in
my
pocket
how
much
had
passed
since
last
sunday
and
i
thought
also
how
differently
i
felt
with
regard
to
the
service
on
the
shore
from
what
i
had
done
when
i
received
the
last
pink
paper
i
had
certainly
no
wish
to
run
away
to
kettleness
to
be
out
of
the
way
when
it
took
place
sunday
morning
was
bright
and
beautiful
and
little
john
was
so
much
better
that
his
father
was
able
to
leave
him
and
to
take
his
place
in
the
choir
i
stood
close
to
the
old
boat
and
jack
put
his
hand
in
mine
and
let
me
look
at
his
as
he
sang
there
was
a
large
congregation
the
fine
day
had
tempted
them
out
and
i
think
the
danger
of
their
companions
and
their
narrow
escape
from
death
had
stirred
the
hearts
of
the
fishermen
and
had
made
many
of
them
feel
that
is
not
all
of
life
to
live
nor
all
of
death
to
die
mates
are
here
sir
whispered
duncan
as
he
went
forward
to
take
his
place
in
the
boat
the
first
time
i
been
able
to
persuade
them
to
come
they
see
the
good
of
it
now
sir
you
see
never
have
i
heard
any
man
pray
more
earnestly
for
a
blessing
than
christie
did
that
day
but
i
do
not
think
even
he
prayed
more
earnestly
than
i
did
my
whole
heart
went
out
to
god
that
day
for
was
it
not
my
first
sunday
on
the
right
side
of
the
line
and
then
came
the
address
and
i
never
noticed
a
congregation
more
attentive
than
was
that
one
gathered
on
the
shore
that
september
morning
i
can
remember
even
now
a
good
deal
of
the
sermon
know
he
said
are
strong
words
confident
words
it
is
not
or
it
is
not
even
that
would
be
wonderful
but
it
is
something
clearer
and
far
more
distinct
than
that
it
is
we
know
i
were
to
ask
you
fishermen
you
visitors
you
mothers
you
little
children
this
question
do
you
you
are
on
the
shore
now
do
you
you
are
here
do
you
you
are
listening
to
me
what
would
you
answer
me
would
say
christie
it
is
not
a
case
of
imagining
or
thinking
or
hoping
we
we
are
here
we
are
sure
of
it
notice
that
is
the
strong
confident
word
used
in
my
text
the
holy
apostle
john
stands
side
by
side
with
all
of
us
who
have
come
to
christ
and
he
bids
us
join
with
him
in
these
glad
happy
thankful
words
we
know
that
we
have
passed
from
death
unto
life
we
know
we
are
persuaded
we
are
sure
that
we
are
on
the
right
side
of
the
line
we
know
that
we
have
left
the
company
of
the
servants
of
sin
and
are
now
the
servants
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
friends
i
would
now
ask
each
of
you
very
earnestly
can
you
say
that
can
you
take
your
stand
by
the
apostle
john
and
say
that
have
passed
from
death
unto
life
think
i
hear
some
one
answer
in
his
heart
well
that
a
great
deal
for
any
man
to
say
and
i
do
see
that
any
man
can
know
in
this
life
if
he
is
saved
or
not
when
he
gets
to
heaven
he
know
he
is
all
right
but
not
till
then
look
again
at
my
text
it
does
not
say
we
know
it
does
not
say
we
hope
soon
to
know
but
it
speaks
in
the
present
it
runs
thus
we
that
we
have
passed
from
death
unto
life
so
you
see
it
possible
nay
it
is
right
that
you
and
i
should
one
by
one
take
up
the
words
and
say
i
hear
some
one
saying
in
his
heart
i
do
wish
i
could
say
that
i
should
be
a
happier
man
if
i
could
when
i
go
out
in
my
boat
and
the
storm
rages
and
i
do
know
whether
i
shall
ever
see
land
again
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
i
could
look
up
through
the
wind
and
tempest
and
could
say
gladly
i
know
that
i
have
passed
from
death
unto
life
i
thought
i
heard
a
groan
when
he
said
this
and
i
looked
round
and
saw
one
of
duncan
mates
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
i
hear
one
of
you
mothers
say
when
i
lie
awake
at
night
and
the
baby
will
not
let
me
sleep
and
i
get
out
and
look
from
my
window
at
the
stars
shining
down
upon
me
i
would
give
a
great
deal
to
say
as
i
think
of
the
heaven
above
those
stars
know
that
i
have
passed
from
death
unto
life
you
my
friend
when
the
day
comes
as
come
it
will
when
you
lie
on
your
bed
and
you
see
by
the
doctor
face
that
you
will
never
get
out
of
it
again
when
you
say
to
yourself
as
the
neighbours
sit
round
this
is
my
dying
bed
and
they
are
watching
to
see
me
die
oh
what
would
you
not
give
at
that
solemn
time
to
be
able
to
say
i
know
that
i
have
passed
from
death
unto
life
you
want
to
be
able
to
say
it
you
can
not
want
it
more
than
god
wants
to
hear
you
say
it
the
christ
stands
on
the
shore
beside
us
and
he
yearns
with
unutterable
longing
that
each
man
each
woman
each
child
here
present
should
be
able
to
take
up
the
words
of
my
text
and
say
i
know
that
i
have
passed
from
death
unto
life
then
he
went
on
to
tell
us
that
it
was
not
a
long
weary
toilsome
journey
which
we
had
to
travel
to
reach
the
christ
he
was
present
amongst
us
now
he
was
very
near
to
each
one
of
us
his
arms
were
wide
open
he
was
waiting
to
receive
each
one
who
was
willing
to
cross
the
line
one
step
would
be
sufficient
one
step
into
those
open
arms
then
we
ended
by
singing
a
hymn
which
seemed
to
me
a
very
beautiful
one
a
step
to
jesus
believe
and
thou
shalt
live
lovingly
now
he
waiting
and
ready
to
forgive
only
a
step
to
jesus
a
step
from
sin
to
grace
what
has
thy
heart
decided
the
moments
fly
apace
only
a
step
to
jesus
oh
why
not
come
and
say
gladly
to
thee
my
saviour
i
give
myself
away
only
a
step
only
a
step
come
he
waits
for
thee
come
and
thy
sin
confessing
thou
shalt
receive
a
blessing
do
not
reject
the
mercy
he
freely
offers
thee
i
was
glad
to
see
at
the
end
of
the
service
that
duncan
mate
was
still
sitting
under
the
old
boat
with
his
hands
over
his
face
he
had
evidently
felt
the
sermon
very
much
and
when
he
rose
to
go
home
after
the
others
had
dispersed
i
saw
christie
walking
by
his
side
that
was
a
lovely
sunday
evening
the
storm
of
the
week
before
seemed
to
have
cleared
the
air
and
there
was
a
golden
light
over
everything
until
the
sun
went
down
behind
the
hill
i
spent
the
evening
at
christie
for
polly
was
still
fully
occupied
with
the
child
and
was
not
able
to
attend
to
much
of
the
work
downstairs
duncan
did
the
cooking
now
and
the
washing
up
and
the
cleaning
and
i
never
saw
a
more
handy
man
he
waited
on
me
hand
and
foot
as
if
i
was
a
lord
but
i
felt
that
i
was
giving
the
dear
fellow
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
was
glad
therefore
to
accept
christie
invitation
to
have
tea
and
supper
at
their
house
little
jack
welcomed
me
with
the
greatest
joy
he
was
so
delighted
to
have
me
at
tea
and
contemplated
me
with
so
much
delight
and
interest
from
his
high
chair
by
my
side
that
he
quite
forgot
to
eat
his
own
tea
and
had
to
be
recalled
from
his
admiration
of
me
time
after
time
by
his
mother
after
tea
he
told
her
he
had
a
great
secret
to
confide
to
her
he
dragged
her
from
the
room
and
led
her
upstairs
and
then
with
closed
doors
and
in
a
whisper
so
low
that
she
could
scarcely
distinguish
the
words
he
told
her
solemnly
do
love
big
jack
very
much
which
secret
his
faithless
mother
was
treacherous
enough
to
reveal
to
me
after
we
had
been
upstairs
that
evening
to
see
little
jack
in
bed
after
we
came
down
christie
lighted
the
lamp
and
we
were
sitting
cosily
round
the
fire
talking
of
my
mother
when
suddenly
there
came
a
knock
at
the
outer
door
can
it
be
said
christie
hastily
one
must
be
ill
i
think
so
few
people
come
on
sunday
she
was
going
to
the
door
but
her
little
maid
had
already
opened
it
and
coming
into
the
parlour
she
announced
a
gentleman
sir
at
the
door
says
as
how
he
wants
villiers
sir
gentleman
i
repeated
in
astonishment
me
sir
he
says
he
wants
you
very
pertickler
he
does
i
went
quickly
to
the
door
wondering
very
much
who
could
be
there
and
to
my
great
astonishment
i
found
my
friend
tom
bernard
with
a
black
bag
in
his
hand
eagerly
awaiting
my
approach
at
last
old
chap
he
cried
when
he
saw
me
i
been
hunting
for
you
all
over
in
this
of
a
place
till
at
last
some
of
these
told
me
you
were
in
here
what
are
you
doing
here
tom
i
exclaimed
here
why
i
come
to
see
you
of
course
old
fellow
what
else
should
i
have
come
for
i
set
off
early
this
morning
and
i
thought
i
would
give
you
a
bit
of
a
surprise
are
these
your
diggings
i
said
only
spending
the
evening
here
but
i
come
back
with
you
at
once
i
went
in
for
a
moment
to
explain
my
sudden
departure
to
and
christie
and
then
i
went
with
tom
to
my
lodgings
he
looked
vastly
amused
when
he
saw
duncan
house
and
when
i
told
him
that
i
had
been
there
all
the
time
he
seemed
to
think
it
a
capital
joke
no
room
for
me
i
afraid
he
said
as
he
looked
with
an
amused
smile
round
my
bedroom
indeed
tom
i
said
joking
apart
i
would
not
ask
you
to
come
here
if
there
was
room
the
hotel
at
the
top
of
the
hill
will
suit
you
better
polly
was
sitting
beside
little
john
but
i
tapped
at
the
door
and
told
her
a
friend
of
mine
had
just
arrived
from
london
and
asked
her
if
she
thought
it
would
be
possible
to
get
him
some
tea
just
at
this
moment
duncan
came
in
and
the
two
good
souls
did
all
in
their
power
to
do
honour
to
my
guest
the
whitest
tablecloth
was
spread
on
the
round
table
the
very
finest
herrings
were
cooked
round
after
round
of
crisp
brown
toast
was
buttered
and
put
before
the
fire
to
keep
hot
and
all
was
ready
in
so
short
a
time
that
tom
was
astonished
he
did
full
justice
to
the
meal
and
seemed
to
appreciate
my
quarters
better
after
he
had
partaken
of
it
then
he
declared
himself
tired
out
so
i
walked
with
him
up
to
the
hotel
he
was
in
high
spirits
and
was
much
looking
forward
to
the
time
we
were
to
have
there
together
and
to
all
the
walks
we
should
take
to
the
places
round
was
i
glad
that
he
had
come
i
asked
myself
this
question
many
times
that
night
i
was
fond
of
tom
he
had
been
like
a
brother
to
me
and
yet
and
yet
i
wished
he
had
not
come
to
runswick
bay
why
was
this
why
would
i
have
kept
him
away
if
i
could
i
asked
myself
this
question
many
times
as
i
came
slowly
down
the
hill
that
night
was
it
because
it
would
be
a
hindrance
to
my
work
no
for
my
picture
had
made
good
progress
and
i
could
work
it
up
even
better
in
my
studio
at
home
besides
which
tom
was
a
fellow
and
would
sit
smoking
and
chatting
in
the
old
boat
whilst
i
painted
was
it
that
i
wanted
to
be
quiet
and
to
enjoy
my
present
surroundings
without
interruption
no
surely
for
tom
company
had
always
been
pleasant
to
me
and
i
could
not
look
upon
him
as
a
stranger
why
was
it
then
that
i
felt
almost
sorry
that
he
had
followed
me
here
i
had
a
suspicion
of
the
right
answer
to
that
question
but
i
did
not
own
it
even
to
myself
till
i
entered
my
lodging
duncan
was
reading
a
chapter
aloud
to
polly
as
he
always
did
before
going
to
bed
he
stopped
when
he
saw
me
come
in
but
i
said
on
duncan
never
mind
me
i
shall
like
to
listen
and
the
very
first
words
that
duncan
read
seemed
to
me
to
contain
the
answer
to
my
question
that
is
ashamed
of
me
and
of
my
words
of
him
shall
the
son
of
man
be
ashamed
yes
that
was
the
reason
i
was
sorry
that
tom
had
come
because
i
was
ashamed
of
my
master
since
i
had
seen
him
last
i
had
changed
my
service
i
used
to
be
a
servant
of
sin
living
for
self
pleasing
self
in
all
things
now
i
had
crossed
the
line
i
had
joined
the
company
of
christ
servants
and
i
was
afraid
of
tom
finding
it
out
in
london
i
thought
i
should
have
seen
less
of
him
and
it
would
have
dawned
on
him
gradually
but
here
he
would
discover
it
at
once
and
i
dreaded
his
doing
so
yes
i
was
a
downright
coward
ashamed
of
the
one
who
had
died
for
me
this
was
not
a
comfortable
reflection
but
i
was
convinced
that
it
was
the
truth
what
would
be
the
best
thing
to
do
should
i
say
anything
to
tom
about
it
in
the
morning
i
thought
at
first
that
i
would
speak
and
i
made
up
several
sentences
with
which
i
meant
to
begin
but
the
more
i
thought
of
it
so
much
the
more
my
heart
failed
me
and
i
decided
at
length
that
my
best
plan
would
be
to
let
tom
find
it
out
for
himself
chapter
xi
little
jack
and
big
jack
i
think
tom
very
much
enjoyed
that
week
at
runswick
bay
the
more
he
saw
of
the
place
the
more
he
liked
it
he
and
duncan
got
on
famously
together
they
smoked
together
on
a
seat
above
the
house
and
duncan
told
him
stories
of
shipwrecks
and
storms
whilst
i
sat
painting
just
below
them
one
night
he
even
persuaded
duncan
to
let
him
go
out
with
him
fishing
and
duncan
confided
to
me
afterwards
there
friend
of
yours
sir
he
a
real
handy
chap
knows
how
to
use
his
fingers
sir
and
afraid
of
a
drop
of
salt
water
neither
we
came
across
christie
on
the
shore
the
very
first
time
that
we
went
out
together
and
i
introduced
him
as
a
friend
of
my
mother
whom
i
had
been
delighted
to
find
in
this
place
and
tom
talked
very
pleasantly
to
him
and
i
think
liked
him
is
he
doing
here
jack
he
said
does
not
look
like
the
rest
of
them
is
a
i
said
in
the
world
is
a
said
tom
laughing
i
did
not
answer
but
called
his
attention
to
little
jack
who
was
running
along
the
shore
after
his
red
cap
which
had
been
carried
off
by
a
gust
of
wind
his
little
boy
i
said
my
namesake
they
lived
in
my
father
parish
in
london
and
christie
and
his
wife
adored
my
mother
it
was
seeing
her
photograph
on
the
wall
of
their
room
which
made
them
discover
who
i
was
a
splendid
little
fellow
said
tom
as
the
child
came
up
to
us
you
are
jack
are
you
i
little
jack
and
he
big
jack
said
the
boy
roguishly
looking
at
me
i
was
not
surprised
that
tom
made
friends
very
quickly
with
my
little
favourite
for
he
was
wonderfully
fond
of
children
and
many
were
the
games
which
he
and
the
two
children
had
together
whilst
i
was
at
work
every
evening
tom
and
i
walked
together
and
we
explored
all
the
country
for
miles
around
sometimes
we
went
by
train
and
walked
back
by
the
cliffs
the
train
seemed
to
land
us
at
each
station
in
the
midst
of
fresh
beauty
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
yorkshire
was
indeed
what
i
had
always
been
told
by
my
mother
the
most
beautiful
county
in
england
jack
said
tom
on
saturday
morning
have
a
really
good
day
you
wo
want
to
paint
will
you
i
said
hurriedly
do
paint
on
sundays
right
he
said
much
the
best
plan
you
come
fresher
to
it
on
monday
all
work
and
no
play
makes
jack
a
dull
boy
that
old
couplet
must
have
been
made
for
you
jack
well
then
let
see
where
shall
we
go
suppose
we
make
a
long
day
of
it
and
go
to
scarborough
we
must
see
scarborough
before
we
go
home
must
we
not
we
will
go
by
the
early
train
and
come
back
as
late
as
we
can
the
worst
of
it
is
there
are
not
so
many
trains
to
choose
from
on
sunday
but
i
daresay
we
shall
find
one
that
will
suit
and
without
saying
another
word
he
went
off
to
my
lodging
for
a
what
was
i
to
do
a
few
weeks
ago
a
sunday
spent
in
pleasure
would
have
been
just
what
i
should
have
chosen
and
many
a
time
had
tom
and
i
been
up
the
river
on
sunday
together
there
was
hardly
a
place
within
easy
distance
up
the
thames
which
we
had
not
visited
in
this
way
but
now
i
felt
very
differently
about
these
things
sunday
was
my
master
own
day
every
moment
of
it
i
felt
must
be
consecrated
to
him
no
one
had
talked
to
me
about
sunday
observance
but
my
conscience
told
me
very
clearly
what
was
right
in
the
matter
yet
although
i
had
no
doubt
as
to
what
i
ought
to
do
in
the
matter
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
for
some
time
i
hesitated
tom
would
be
so
terribly
disappointed
i
said
to
myself
and
he
had
been
a
good
friend
to
me
and
i
did
not
want
to
vex
him
surely
there
would
be
no
great
harm
in
obliging
him
this
once
besides
when
i
get
to
scarborough
i
may
have
time
to
go
to
church
and
then
after
all
where
is
the
difference
i
argued
with
myself
i
shall
take
a
longer
journey
to
church
that
is
all
and
then
tom
came
back
full
of
his
plans
for
the
day
he
had
already
settled
the
train
we
were
to
catch
and
he
told
me
that
he
looked
forward
to
seeing
scarborough
immensely
as
his
mother
had
stayed
there
a
year
ago
and
she
had
told
him
it
was
the
most
beautiful
she
had
ever
visited
i
tried
to
feel
pleased
with
what
tom
had
arranged
but
in
my
heart
i
was
very
miserable
and
just
at
that
moment
who
should
appear
but
marjorie
and
jack
distributing
the
pink
papers
containing
the
invitation
to
the
service
on
the
shore
i
turned
away
when
i
saw
them
coming
i
looked
towards
the
sea
and
took
my
little
telescope
from
my
pocket
that
i
might
seem
to
be
intent
on
watching
a
distant
steamer
what
would
duncan
say
what
would
christie
say
what
would
my
little
friend
jack
say
when
i
did
not
appear
at
the
shore
service
and
how
shocked
they
would
be
when
they
heard
i
had
gone
off
for
a
pleasure
i
hoped
that
the
children
would
pass
us
by
and
would
go
to
a
large
group
of
fishermen
standing
on
the
shore
just
beyond
us
but
i
was
not
to
escape
thus
marjorie
came
up
to
tom
and
presented
him
with
a
paper
and
she
was
going
to
give
one
to
me
but
my
little
friend
stopped
her
no
marjorie
he
said
in
his
most
fascinating
tones
me
give
one
to
my
own
jack
i
always
give
you
one
my
own
self
do
i
big
jack
i
patted
him
on
the
head
and
took
the
paper
but
i
did
not
answer
and
the
children
passed
on
tom
opened
his
paper
and
read
it
aloud
there
will
be
a
short
service
on
the
shore
next
sunday
morning
oh
indeed
he
said
what
they
after
is
it
distributing
notices
for
some
methodist
meeting
is
that
where
christie
holds
forth
i
said
preaches
every
sunday
christie
he
went
on
wo
have
there
to
hear
you
i
hate
those
canting
meetings
do
you
jack
ah
he
tells
us
his
subject
beforehand
does
he
very
kind
of
him
i
sure
where
are
you
ah
said
tom
soon
answered
i
going
to
scarborough
old
fellow
and
a
jolly
good
day
i
hope
to
have
there
and
he
threw
the
little
pink
paper
into
the
air
and
the
wind
carried
it
far
out
to
sea
illustration
all
this
time
i
had
never
spoken
a
word
a
great
battle
was
going
on
in
my
heart
conscience
was
speaking
very
loudly
and
telling
me
that
i
could
not
possibly
take
my
pleasure
on
my
master
own
day
but
the
tempter
voice
was
arguing
that
the
time
to
speak
had
not
yet
come
and
that
perhaps
for
this
once
it
would
be
better
to
yield
to
tom
wishes
and
that
i
might
talk
to
him
quietly
about
it
and
make
a
fresh
start
after
our
return
to
london
and
so
the
day
wore
away
and
evening
came
and
tom
had
no
idea
whatever
that
i
had
even
hesitated
about
going
with
him
to
scarborough
i
never
spent
a
more
unhappy
day
i
avoided
christie
lest
he
should
say
anything
to
me
about
the
service
on
the
following
day
i
was
not
even
happy
with
duncan
tom
had
gone
off
to
saltburn
leaving
me
as
he
supposed
to
put
some
finishing
touches
to
my
picture
but
i
had
no
heart
for
painting
and
only
got
my
easel
and
painting
materials
out
to
put
them
away
again
directly
polly
was
in
good
spirits
that
day
for
little
john
was
so
much
better
that
he
was
able
to
sit
on
the
floor
and
play
and
as
i
stood
looking
out
of
my
small
casement
window
i
watched
her
washing
up
in
a
tub
standing
on
a
wooden
stool
outside
her
door
and
i
heard
her
singing
to
herself
as
she
did
so
most
of
the
visitors
had
left
runswick
bay
now
for
it
was
late
in
the
season
but
the
shore
was
covered
with
the
village
children
boys
and
girls
without
shoes
and
stockings
wading
in
the
pools
and
running
far
out
into
the
shallow
sea
it
was
a
pretty
sight
the
grey
quiet
water
the
strips
of
yellow
sand
and
the
cliff
covered
with
grass
and
flowers
but
i
could
not
enjoy
the
scene
that
saturday
evening
even
my
artistic
eye
of
which
i
used
sometimes
to
boast
failed
me
then
i
was
feeling
thoroughly
uncomfortable
and
the
most
lovely
view
on
earth
would
have
failed
to
charm
me
at
that
moment
there
is
a
verse
in
the
bible
which
says
little
child
shall
lead
them
and
whenever
i
hear
that
verse
i
think
of
that
evening
in
runswick
bay
for
i
was
still
gazing
out
of
my
window
looking
at
i
knew
not
what
when
i
heard
a
little
voice
just
beneath
me
it
was
jack
he
had
come
down
the
hill
beneath
duncan
cottage
so
that
i
had
not
seen
him
until
he
spoke
to
me
below
the
window
jack
he
said
are
you
doing
up
there
are
you
busy
old
man
i
said
not
busy
come
out
that
a
dear
big
jack
i
do
want
you
so
much
who
could
resist
the
pleading
little
face
and
the
pretty
fascinating
voice
of
that
child
he
would
have
a
hard
heart
who
could
do
so
i
ran
downstairs
and
a
minute
afterwards
i
was
racing
with
jack
on
the
wet
sands
for
the
tide
was
fast
going
out
and
was
helping
him
to
fly
a
small
kite
which
his
father
had
bought
for
him
in
whitby
we
had
a
fine
time
together
on
the
shore
until
at
last
a
towel
was
hung
out
of
the
top
window
in
the
christies
house
as
a
sign
that
it
was
bedtime
though
he
was
wild
with
joy
and
excitement
the
obedient
little
fellow
at
once
stopped
his
play
and
told
me
mother
wanted
him
and
he
must
go
coming
for
you
morning
jack
he
said
morning
jack
for
church
said
the
child
putting
up
his
dear
little
chubby
face
to
be
kissed
go
without
me
will
you
mr
jack
i
not
sure
i
going
little
man
i
said
reluctantly
you
had
better
not
call
for
me
going
to
church
said
jack
in
a
very
shocked
voice
not
mr
jack
going
to
scarborough
for
the
day
with
my
friend
tom
i
said
shall
go
to
church
in
scarborough
jack
i
shall
never
forget
the
expression
of
that
child
face
as
long
as
i
live
it
was
a
mixture
of
surprise
sorrow
and
dismay
jack
do
you
know
it
god
day
was
all
that
he
said
however
and
as
at
this
moment
his
mother
called
him
from
the
bedroom
window
he
ran
off
without
another
word
you
know
it
god
day
i
asked
myself
when
the
little
boy
had
gone
i
do
know
i
answered
aloud
he
is
my
master
and
my
master
day
shall
be
kept
for
him
and
for
his
service
i
walked
to
a
lonely
place
on
the
shore
where
the
sea
had
undermined
the
cliff
and
had
made
strange
holes
and
caves
which
could
only
be
entered
at
low
tide
i
clambered
over
the
rocks
and
crossed
about
half
a
mile
of
slippery
seaweed
until
i
came
to
one
of
these
weird
places
creeping
inside
i
felt
myself
safe
from
any
human
eye
i
was
alone
alone
with
my
master
i
can
not
tell
you
all
that
passed
during
the
that
i
spent
in
that
lonely
cave
but
i
know
this
that
i
came
out
of
it
feeling
that
my
master
had
indeed
given
me
the
strength
for
which
i
had
pleaded
the
strength
to
act
as
his
faithful
and
true
servant
i
was
waiting
outside
the
station
when
tom
train
came
in
from
saltburn
he
had
not
expected
to
see
me
again
that
night
and
seemed
pleased
that
i
had
come
to
meet
him
think
we
shall
have
a
fine
day
old
boy
he
said
a
dew
there
is
my
feet
are
quite
wet
with
it
i
said
came
to
meet
you
because
i
wanted
to
tell
you
something
i
am
sorry
very
sorry
to
disappoint
you
but
i
ca
go
with
you
ever
in
the
world
not
jack
he
said
thought
you
were
so
keen
on
seeing
scarborough
tom
i
said
i
am
still
more
keen
on
something
else
that
he
asked
you
mean
redcar
it
a
stupid
place
jack
nothing
in
the
world
to
see
i
assure
you
tom
i
do
mean
that
i
do
want
to
change
our
plan
i
had
rather
see
scarborough
than
any
other
place
i
give
myself
a
holiday
on
monday
and
go
with
you
gladly
tom
but
i
ca
go
jack
he
said
angrily
go
if
you
like
what
to
hinder
you
if
you
are
willing
to
go
at
all
why
on
earth
ca
you
go
because
is
sunday
tom
if
it
is
sunday
what
of
that
said
my
friend
the
better
the
day
the
better
the
deed
and
it
ridiculous
your
talking
in
this
saintly
way
about
sunday
when
to
my
certain
knowledge
you
spent
every
fine
sunday
boating
on
the
river
for
the
last
two
years
or
more
no
no
my
friend
that
wo
go
down
with
me
i
said
all
quite
true
what
you
say
i
have
i
know
i
have
spent
my
sundays
in
boating
or
in
taking
my
pleasure
in
some
other
way
and
i
am
more
sorry
for
it
tom
than
i
can
tell
you
but
since
i
came
here
you
came
here
tom
interrupted
me
gone
and
turned
ranter
or
methodist
or
something
of
that
sort
and
you
got
your
head
full
of
all
sorts
of
insane
and
ridiculous
ideas
i
came
here
tom
i
said
taking
no
notice
of
his
last
remark
have
seen
what
i
never
saw
before
that
i
am
a
great
sinner
and
i
have
found
what
i
never
found
before
that
jesus
is
a
great
saviour
i
wish
you
had
never
come
to
runswick
bay
if
this
is
the
absurd
way
you
are
going
on
jack
and
after
all
the
good
old
times
we
had
together
too
why
sha
we
have
good
times
together
still
dear
old
tom
i
said
have
entered
the
service
of
a
new
master
that
all
and
tom
i
said
timidly
wish
he
was
your
master
too
tom
made
no
answer
but
swung
his
stick
round
and
round
and
slashed
at
the
thistles
and
the
daisies
which
grew
by
the
roadside
i
tried
to
make
one
or
two
remarks
but
i
saw
he
was
very
much
upset
by
what
i
had
said
and
he
did
not
answer
me
he
was
vexed
with
me
and
perhaps
he
was
a
little
uncomfortable
besides
and
i
felt
it
was
far
wiser
to
say
no
more
he
did
not
speak
again
until
we
reached
the
hotel
and
then
he
simply
said
jack
i
sorry
you
gone
and
made
such
a
fool
of
yourself
and
i
went
down
the
hill
feeling
as
if
i
had
lost
my
friend
and
as
if
the
old
days
and
old
companionship
were
dead
and
buried
for
ever
but
if
i
had
lost
one
friend
i
felt
i
had
gained
another
christie
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
he
proposed
that
we
should
take
a
turn
together
on
the
shore
nellie
was
expecting
me
to
supper
he
said
he
had
told
duncan
i
was
going
there
and
the
moon
was
coming
out
and
a
good
stretch
on
the
sands
would
make
us
enjoy
it
all
the
more
we
had
walked
across
the
bay
and
were
standing
gazing
out
seawards
when
he
suddenly
put
his
arm
in
mine
is
it
jack
he
said
kindly
is
troubling
you
this
evening
you
are
right
i
said
did
you
know
christie
i
am
bothered
a
bit
the
fact
is
i
ashamed
of
myself
i
been
such
a
coward
have
you
been
doing
jack
you
do
mind
telling
me
do
you
at
all
christie
i
would
rather
tell
you
i
said
and
then
i
gave
him
an
account
of
the
last
week
of
my
fear
of
tom
and
how
very
nearly
i
was
ashamed
to
say
it
i
had
yielded
to
him
about
the
outing
then
i
spoke
of
my
friend
and
i
told
him
i
was
afraid
i
had
lost
him
through
my
plain
speaking
mind
jack
he
said
master
must
come
first
and
it
does
happen
very
often
that
when
he
is
put
in
his
right
place
we
have
to
give
up
a
great
deal
he
knew
we
should
have
to
do
it
and
he
spoke
some
very
plain
words
about
it
he
that
loveth
father
or
mother
more
than
me
is
not
worthy
of
me
and
he
that
loveth
son
or
daughter
more
than
me
is
not
worthy
of
me
you
would
like
to
be
worthy
of
him
jack
shall
never
be
that
christie
i
said
he
said
are
right
we
are
all
unworthy
of
him
but
when
we
love
him
we
do
long
to
do
that
which
is
pleasing
in
his
sight
and
remember
there
is
always
the
hundredfold
jack
always
the
reward
for
anything
we
give
up
for
him
in
heaven
i
said
softly
jack
not
in
heaven
but
on
earth
do
you
remember
how
the
words
run
he
shall
receive
an
hundredfold
in
this
and
in
the
world
to
come
life
everlasting
the
hundredfold
is
to
be
enjoyed
the
everlasting
life
never
noticed
that
before
i
said
have
proved
it
true
jack
abundantly
true
i
sometimes
think
i
have
got
beyond
the
hundredfold
and
then
beyond
there
lies
the
life
eternal
mother
is
enjoying
that
i
said
indeed
he
answered
her
boy
will
enjoy
it
too
in
god
good
time
for
does
not
the
master
say
of
all
those
who
belong
to
him
i
give
unto
them
eternal
life
i
am
come
that
they
might
have
life
and
that
they
might
have
it
more
abundantly

chapter
xii
where
are
you
going
i
shall
never
forget
my
last
sunday
in
runswick
bay
it
was
at
the
end
of
september
and
was
one
of
those
gloriously
brilliant
days
which
we
get
in
the
early
autumn
when
the
sky
is
cloudless
when
the
air
is
fresh
and
clear
and
when
the
autumnal
tints
on
trees
hedges
ferns
and
brambles
make
the
landscape
gorgeous
and
extremely
beautiful
and
fascinating
the
high
cliff
above
the
bay
was
a
perfect
study
in
colour
that
morning
i
have
never
seen
more
splendid
colouring
every
varied
shade
of
red
and
gold
and
green
was
to
be
found
there
will
be
off
to
scarborough
i
said
to
myself
as
i
dressed
a
grand
day
he
has
got
but
i
did
not
wish
myself
with
him
no
i
was
both
glad
and
thankful
to
look
forward
to
a
quiet
and
peaceful
sunday
there
were
not
many
visitors
still
at
runswick
most
of
them
had
left
the
week
before
but
the
fishermen
came
in
great
numbers
to
the
service
and
the
green
was
covered
with
them
when
little
jack
and
big
jack
appeared
as
usual
duncan
was
in
the
choir
but
polly
thought
the
wind
rather
cold
for
little
john
so
had
remained
with
him
at
home
a
good
many
women
and
children
were
present
however
and
the
bank
was
covered
with
mothers
and
babies
sitting
at
a
little
distance
lest
the
noise
of
the
children
should
disturb
the
preacher
or
the
listeners
what
was
it
that
made
me
think
of
tom
just
as
the
service
began
was
it
a
shepherd
plaid
cloth
cap
of
the
kind
tom
wears
which
i
saw
on
the
head
of
some
visitor
who
was
sitting
almost
out
of
sight
on
the
seaward
side
of
the
bank
such
small
things
bring
people
and
things
before
us
sometimes
and
my
thoughts
wandered
to
scarborough
for
a
few
minutes
and
i
wondered
what
tom
was
doing
at
that
moment
i
thought
to
myself
how
he
would
smile
if
he
saw
me
sitting
under
the
old
boat
and
listening
attentively
to
an
open
air
preacher
but
my
thoughts
did
not
wander
long
for
when
the
service
began
every
word
of
it
seemed
to
be
for
me
where
are
you
going
i
had
worked
the
subject
out
in
my
mind
before
i
came
to
the
service
and
had
quite
decided
what
line
of
thought
christie
would
take
i
thought
he
would
picture
the
two
roads
the
one
leading
to
life
the
other
to
destruction
and
then
i
imagined
that
he
would
speak
of
the
blessedness
of
being
on
the
narrow
road
and
would
dwell
very
vividly
on
the
awful
consequences
of
continuing
to
walk
on
the
road
leading
to
hell
but
i
found
that
my
idea
of
what
his
sermon
would
be
was
quite
a
mistaken
one
are
you
going
my
question
he
said
addressed
only
to
some
of
you
would
to
god
it
were
addressed
to
you
all
i
speak
to
those
who
have
crossed
the
line
who
have
run
into
the
loving
saviour
arms
who
have
become
servants
of
christ
friends
my
dear
friends
where
are
you
going
what
does
the
master
say
he
calls
to
every
one
of
his
servants
and
he
says
if
any
man
serve
me
let
him
follow
me
and
i
there
shall
also
my
servant
be
of
christ
where
are
you
going
the
master
answers
you
where
i
am
where
is
that
a
little
group
of
men
are
standing
on
the
mount
of
olives
above
them
is
the
deep
blue
sky
and
they
are
gazing
earnestly
upward
for
their
master
is
rising
far
above
them
and
even
as
they
watch
a
cloud
receives
him
out
of
their
sight
yet
still
he
ascends
higher
and
yet
higher
and
as
he
rises
countless
angels
attend
him
he
is
joined
by
company
after
company
of
the
heavenly
host
who
have
come
out
to
meet
their
king
at
length
heaven
gates
are
reached
and
the
cry
goes
forth
lift
up
your
heads
o
ye
gates
even
lift
them
up
ye
everlasting
doors
and
the
king
of
glory
shall
come
in
amidst
most
joyful
music
the
master
passes
within
to
the
heavenly
jerusalem
the
glad
glorious
home
every
care
every
sin
every
sorrow
is
left
outside
within
all
is
sunshine
all
is
joy
and
as
heaven
gates
are
closing
we
hear
the
master
voice
he
leaves
us
a
word
of
hope
where
i
am
shall
also
my
servant
be
fishermen
oh
friends
think
of
that
if
you
are
his
servants
those
gates
will
open
for
you
your
life
may
be
hard
now
some
of
you
have
large
families
and
heavy
work
and
long
cold
comfortless
nights
tossing
on
the
stormy
sea
but
never
mind
home
is
coming
heaven
is
coming
for
where
i
am
there
shall
also
my
servant
be
that
is
not
all
there
is
something
more
wonderful
still
for
where
is
the
master
now
he
is
not
only
inside
the
gates
of
the
city
he
is
not
only
walking
through
the
golden
streets
but
he
is
in
the
midst
of
the
glory
of
god
he
has
sat
down
on
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
of
god
will
you
and
i
dear
friends
ever
dare
to
go
near
that
throne
will
not
the
glory
be
too
dazzling
will
not
the
place
be
holy
ground
too
holy
for
us
to
approach
will
he
allow
us
to
draw
near
to
his
footstool
and
even
there
close
to
his
glory
to
lie
low
before
him
o
servant
of
christ
again
the
master
says
where
i
am
shall
also
my
servant
be
on
the
throne
of
god
yes
even
he
bids
you
come
for
what
does
he
say
to
him
that
overcometh
will
i
grant
to
sit
with
me
in
my
throne
even
as
i
also
overcame
and
am
set
down
with
my
father
in
his
throne
oh
what
a
wonderful
promise
we
could
never
have
thought
of
it
we
could
never
have
believed
it
we
could
never
even
have
dreamt
of
such
a
thing
if
the
master
had
not
told
us
himself
and
then
he
concluded
by
asking
us
to
remember
our
glorious
future
he
said
get
downhearted
full
of
sorrow
and
fear
and
you
say
i
shall
never
hold
on
to
the
end
oh
dear
friends
it
is
worth
an
effort
for
at
the
end
lies
home
at
the
end
stands
the
throne
of
god
with
a
place
waiting
for
you
upon
it
where
i
am
there
shall
also
my
servant
be
if
you
have
to
bear
something
for
the
master
sake
what
if
you
have
to
give
up
friends
or
comforts
for
him
what
if
you
have
to
take
up
your
cross
and
follow
him
it
is
only
for
a
few
days
only
for
a
little
while
and
home
is
coming
where
i
am
there
shall
also
my
servant
be
is
it
not
worth
while
then
as
he
ended
he
spoke
a
few
words
to
all
who
were
there
and
he
begged
those
who
were
not
servants
of
christ
to
consider
what
they
were
losing
this
might
be
yours
he
said
gates
the
heavenly
city
the
seat
on
the
glorious
throne
but
you
are
turning
your
backs
on
it
all
and
you
are
choosing
instead
what
a
few
of
fleeting
pleasures
a
little
of
this
world
passing
enjoyment
oh
dear
friends
think
before
it
is
too
late
what
your
eternal
loss
will
be
he
said
much
more
but
i
can
not
remember
it
now
i
only
know
that
i
came
away
feeling
that
i
had
been
very
near
the
golden
gates
of
which
he
spoke
and
had
heard
the
master
voice
saying
to
me
i
am
there
shall
also
my
servant
be
the
tide
was
coming
in
as
we
left
the
service
and
i
was
standing
on
the
shore
watching
the
waves
rolling
in
over
the
rocks
when
i
felt
an
arm
slipped
in
mine
and
when
i
looked
round
to
my
great
surprise
i
found
that
it
was
tom
tom
i
said
already
how
early
you
have
come
home
jack
he
said
laughing
i
never
been
you
mean
you
have
been
to
scarborough
of
course
not
you
did
think
i
would
go
without
you
old
boy
we
go
of
course
i
thought
we
settled
that
last
night
i
been
thinking
of
you
in
scarborough
all
day
i
said
your
thoughts
have
gone
in
a
wrong
direction
for
once
jack
he
replied
i
been
here
all
the
time
walk
with
you
up
the
hill
i
said
is
quite
i
was
very
pleased
to
see
him
and
to
find
that
he
did
not
appear
to
be
vexed
with
me
we
chatted
for
some
time
and
then
he
said
casually
does
not
speak
badly
that
lay
preacher
of
yours
jack
i
stood
still
in
astonishment
i
said
christie
why
you
surely
were
not
at
the
service
tom
oh
i
know
i
cried
before
he
could
answer
were
behind
the
bank
i
saw
a
black
and
white
cap
and
i
thought
how
much
it
was
like
yours
could
not
be
much
more
like
seeing
that
it
was
the
very
same
said
tom
so
glad
you
heard
him
i
ventured
to
say
he
made
no
answer
so
i
thought
it
was
better
to
say
no
more
but
when
we
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
and
he
was
just
leaving
me
he
said
i
afraid
i
was
a
bit
crusty
last
night
you
must
not
think
any
more
of
it
old
fellow
we
have
a
jolly
day
at
scarborough
and
jack
he
went
on
was
very
much
annoyed
at
the
time
i
own
i
was
but
i
not
sure
after
all
that
you
not
right
he
said
no
more
but
hurried
away
and
it
was
many
years
before
he
referred
to
the
subject
again
but
the
day
came
when
he
did
mention
it
and
when
he
told
me
with
tears
in
his
eyes
that
he
looked
upon
that
sunday
at
runswick
as
the
first
link
in
the
chain
of
god
loving
providence
by
means
of
which
he
had
led
him
to
himself
he
told
me
then
that
he
had
never
forgotten
my
firm
refusal
to
go
with
him
and
he
had
never
forgotten
the
sermon
to
which
he
had
listened
hidden
from
sight
by
the
bank
our
day
at
scarborough
exceeded
all
our
anticipations
the
weather
was
glorious
and
tom
was
in
excellent
spirits
and
we
thoroughly
enjoyed
everything
i
could
not
help
feeling
sorry
when
thursday
came
which
was
to
be
my
last
day
at
runswick
bay
it
had
been
such
a
happy
and
so
eventful
a
time
i
seemed
to
have
passed
through
so
much
and
to
have
learnt
so
much
unknown
to
me
before
that
i
felt
very
reluctant
to
bring
my
holiday
to
a
close
as
for
duncan
and
polly
they
were
quite
melancholy
as
the
time
for
my
departure
drew
near
feel
lost
without
you
sir
said
duncan
know
what
to
do
and
there
were
tears
in
polly
eyes
as
she
said
mournfully
when
she
set
the
herrings
on
the
table
for
my
supper
the
last
herrings
i
shall
fry
you
sir
and
i
feel
as
if
there
was
going
to
be
a
death
in
the
house
up
polly
i
said
knows
perhaps
you
may
have
to
put
up
with
me
next
time
i
get
a
holiday
and
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
want
plenty
of
herrings
then
she
brightened
a
little
at
this
and
little
john
who
was
quite
well
now
and
who
had
become
very
friendly
with
me
since
his
illness
climbed
up
on
my
knee
and
stroked
my
face
with
his
little
thin
hand
as
if
he
were
trying
to
coax
me
to
come
back
to
them
again
there
was
one
thing
which
i
had
a
great
desire
to
do
before
leaving
runswick
i
knew
that
duncan
was
much
troubled
about
the
mary
ann
she
had
been
terribly
knocked
about
in
the
storm
which
was
no
wonder
seeing
that
she
had
drifted
about
bottom
upwards
and
had
been
driven
hither
and
thither
on
the
waves
when
duncan
had
examined
her
the
day
after
his
arrival
he
had
found
that
she
leaked
in
several
places
and
was
altogether
unseaworthy
and
he
had
been
obliged
to
hire
a
boat
until
such
time
as
the
mary
ann
could
be
properly
repaired
then
he
went
over
to
whitby
and
brought
an
experienced
man
back
with
him
and
he
overhauled
her
thoroughly
and
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
it
would
be
a
waste
of
money
to
try
to
patch
her
up
when
duncan
came
in
that
night
i
saw
that
the
poor
fellow
was
terribly
downcast
mary
ann
days
are
numbered
sir
she
never
be
able
to
rough
it
again
he
said
been
a
good
old
boat
to
me
and
my
father
before
me
and
it
will
be
like
parting
from
an
old
friend
to
give
her
up
yon
man
he
says
she
might
be
cobbled
together
a
bit
but
you
would
never
make
a
good
job
of
her
she
do
maybe
well
enough
for
fine
weather
but
you
could
trust
to
her
in
a
storm
i
saw
polly
turn
pale
as
he
said
this
she
said
going
up
to
him
and
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
never
go
in
her
again
promise
me
that
think
of
me
and
little
john
duncan
my
lass
he
said
polly
i
do
think
of
thee
and
little
john
but
the
worst
of
it
is
there
bread
must
be
earnt
for
thee
and
little
john
i
ca
let
thee
starve
wife
about
the
duncan
i
said
he
went
to
the
old
and
brought
it
out
i
was
much
touched
by
his
handing
it
to
me
and
bidding
me
see
how
it
stood
he
was
perfectly
open
with
me
and
spoke
to
me
as
freely
as
if
i
had
been
an
old
and
tried
friend
i
added
up
the
amount
and
read
it
out
to
him
sir
said
getting
on
but
it
a
good
ten
pound
short
yet
we
shall
have
to
hire
brown
boat
a
bit
and
do
as
well
as
we
can
though
it
is
a
very
paying
business
when
one
takes
to
hiring
it
will
be
hard
enough
to
make
two
ends
meet
you
see
sir
let
alone
saving
up
for
the
new
boat
but
i
ca
see
nothing
else
for
it
sir
that
is
if
polly
wo
let
me
risk
it
in
the
mary
ann
she
said
solemnly
thee
went
to
sea
in
the
mary
ann
and
she
went
to
the
bottom
i
could
say
the
will
of
the
lord
be
done
for
i
do
believe
it
be
god
will
for
thee
to
go
in
that
rotten
old
thing
is
right
duncan
i
said
must
never
go
in
the
mary
ann
again
sir
he
said
see
what
you
mean
you
and
polly
too
and
the
lord
will
show
us
what
to
be
done
nothing
more
was
said
about
the
mary
ann
at
that
time
but
i
had
already
made
my
own
plan
about
the
new
boat
my
aunt
had
just
left
me
her
little
property
and
a
very
nice
little
property
it
was
i
felt
myself
a
rich
man
for
in
addition
to
money
invested
in
various
ways
about
of
ready
money
had
been
placed
to
my
account
at
the
bank
what
could
be
more
delightful
i
thought
than
to
spend
the
first
ten
pounds
of
this
in
helping
duncan
to
complete
the
purchase
of
the
new
boat
the
only
difficulty
would
be
to
get
duncan
to
accept
the
money
for
he
had
all
the
honest
independence
of
a
yorkshireman
and
i
knew
would
hesitate
about
receiving
help
from
any
one
but
at
the
same
time
i
knew
that
in
this
instance
his
need
was
great
and
his
kindly
feeling
towards
myself
was
so
strong
that
i
was
not
without
hope
that
i
might
be
able
to
manage
what
i
had
contemplated
without
giving
the
dear
fellow
offence
i
thought
at
one
time
that
i
would
take
christie
into
my
confidence
and
would
consult
with
him
but
on
second
thoughts
i
decided
that
it
would
be
wiser
not
to
do
so
and
felt
that
i
should
be
more
likely
to
succeed
if
no
one
else
was
in
the
secret
so
i
folded
my
in
paper
put
it
into
an
envelope
and
wrote
outside
little
john
love
to
his
daddy
to
help
him
to
buy
another
little
john
this
i
determined
to
slip
into
the
child
hand
when
i
said
that
evening
i
had
supper
with
the
christies
they
were
kindness
itself
and
told
me
what
a
great
pleasure
it
had
been
to
them
to
meet
me
only
because
you
are
your
mother
son
jack
but
for
your
own
sake
as
well
as
hers
said
christie
with
a
smile
i
wanted
to
say
something
in
return
but
the
words
would
not
come
at
least
not
then
but
just
before
i
left
i
went
with
christie
into
his
study
and
he
said
i
thought
perhaps
we
might
have
a
little
prayer
together
before
we
part
and
then
the
words
came
christie
i
said
can
never
never
thank
god
enough
that
i
came
here
us
thank
him
together
jack
he
said
then
we
knelt
down
he
by
the
table
and
i
with
my
arms
resting
on
the
old
organ
and
he
thanked
god
for
his
mercy
in
bringing
me
across
the
line
and
he
committed
me
to
his
care
and
keeping
to
bring
me
safely
along
the
road
which
leads
home
the
next
morning
i
was
up
early
for
our
train
started
at
eight
and
we
had
two
miles
to
walk
i
had
told
polly
i
should
want
nothing
but
a
cup
of
tea
before
i
set
off
but
when
i
came
down
i
found
a
most
tempting
breakfast
prepared
for
me
ham
and
eggs
and
toast
in
abundance
and
fresh
lettuces
from
duncan
small
garden
polly
i
said
are
spoiling
me
to
the
last
can
never
make
enough
of
you
sir
said
polly
and
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
as
she
said
it
i
ran
up
to
pack
my
bag
and
collect
my
things
and
i
determined
to
start
in
good
time
so
that
i
might
allow
myself
a
few
minutes
to
say
to
the
christies
must
be
off
duncan
i
said
he
was
standing
outside
with
little
john
in
his
arms
and
polly
with
her
hat
on
was
standing
beside
him
coming
along
with
you
sir
to
the
station
said
duncan
wo
think
it
a
liberty
will
you
sir
but
me
and
polly
and
little
john
would
like
to
see
the
last
of
you
that
good
of
you
i
said
shall
have
a
grand
escort
up
the
hill
polly
took
the
child
from
his
father
and
duncan
carried
my
bag
and
easel
and
would
not
even
hear
of
my
giving
him
a
hand
with
them
i
ran
into
the
christies
but
could
find
no
one
below
however
i
heard
a
great
running
backwards
and
forwards
overhead
and
presently
christie
called
out
of
the
bedroom
window
one
moment
jack
we
are
all
coming
to
see
you
off
so
my
escort
increased
as
i
proceeded
and
tom
as
he
came
out
of
the
hotel
said
he
thought
the
whole
of
runswick
must
be
going
by
the
early
train
when
he
saw
us
one
after
another
come
toiling
up
the
hill
little
jack
rode
up
the
whole
way
on
my
back
and
his
horse
was
very
hot
when
the
top
was
reached
though
it
is
now
so
many
years
ago
i
can
see
that
little
party
of
friends
standing
together
on
the
platform
as
the
train
moved
out
of
the
station
i
can
feel
again
the
warm
grasp
of
christie
hand
and
can
hear
his
whispered
bless
you
jack
i
can
see
christie
holding
marjorie
by
the
hand
and
waving
her
handkerchief
to
me
and
can
hear
little
jack
crying
out
back
soon
do
big
mr
jack
i
can
see
duncan
bareheaded
with
little
john
in
his
arms
the
child
waving
the
envelope
which
i
had
put
in
his
hand
as
i
stepped
into
the
carriage
and
which
was
still
unopened
i
can
see
polly
wiping
her
eyes
with
her
apron
and
then
holding
it
up
and
waving
it
till
i
was
lost
to
sight
i
can
see
them
all
as
they
appeared
to
me
that
day
kind
hearts
and
true
not
one
of
them
ranking
amongst
the
number
whom
the
world
counts
great
and
yet
all
of
them
well
known
to
him
who
calleth
his
own
sheep
by
name
and
leadeth
them
out
i
must
just
mention
here
that
i
had
a
very
touching
letter
from
duncan
at
the
end
of
that
week
the
spelling
was
most
wonderful
and
the
grammar
was
quite
of
his
own
making
but
it
was
full
from
end
to
end
of
the
most
affection
and
of
the
deepest
gratitude
and
my
missus
and
little
john
can
never
be
thankful
enough
sir
he
said
when
the
other
john
is
afloat
as
please
god
she
soon
will
be
we
hopes
as
how
you
will
come
and
have
a
sail
in
her
so
ended
my
visit
to
runswick
and
when
i
consider
all
that
happened
during
those
few
weeks
i
think
it
is
small
wonder
that
the
little
bay
is
still
fresh
in
my
memory
and
that
ella
yellow
ragwort
made
me
dream
of
it
so
distinctly
for
surely
that
month
was
the
most
important
month
in
my
life
for
was
it
not
the
beginning
of
a
new
life
which
thank
god
has
continued
ever
since
i
can
say
even
as
i
said
then
is
my
master
even
christ
and
i
can
look
forward
humbly
but
hopefully
to
the
time
when
the
golden
gates
will
open
to
me
and
when
the
master
promise
will
be
fulfilled
to
me
i
am
there
shall
also
my
servant
be
o
jesus
christ
my
master
i
come
to
thee
i
ask
thee
to
direct
me
in
all
i
do
or
say
i
want
to
keep
my
promise
to
be
thy
servant
true
i
come
to
thee
for
orders
dear
lord
what
shall
i
do
i
want
a
heart
not
heeding
what
others
think
or
say
i
want
a
humble
spirit
to
listen
and
obey
to
serve
thee
without
ceasing
is
but
a
little
while
my
strength
the
master
promise
my
joy
the
master
smile
