reminiscences

never

i
fail
to
i
do
not
happen
to
be
my
diary
should
not
be
only
regret
is
that
i
did
not
commence
it
when
i
was
a
charles
pooter
chapter
i
we
settle
down
in
our
new
home
and
i
resolve
to
keep
a
diary
tradesmen
trouble
us
a
bit
so
does
the
scraper
the
curate
calls
and
pays
me
a
great
compliment
my
dear
wife
carrie
and
i
have
just
been
a
week
in
our
new
house
laurels
brickfield
terrace
nice
residence
not
counting
basement
with
a
front
we
have
a
little
front
garden
and
there
is
a
flight
of
ten
steps
up
to
the
front
door
which
we
keep
locked
with
the
chain
up
cummings
gowing
and
our
other
intimate
friends
always
come
to
the
little
side
entrance
which
saves
the
servant
the
trouble
of
going
up
to
the
front
door
thereby
taking
her
from
her
work
we
have
a
nice
little
back
garden
which
runs
down
to
the
railway
we
were
rather
afraid
of
the
noise
of
the
trains
at
first
but
the
landlord
said
we
should
not
notice
them
after
a
bit
and
took
off
the
rent
he
was
certainly
right
and
beyond
the
cracking
of
the
garden
wall
at
the
bottom
we
have
suffered
no
inconvenience
after
my
work
in
the
city
i
like
to
be
at
home
the
good
of
a
home
if
you
are
never
in
it
sweet
home
my
motto
i
am
always
in
of
an
evening
our
old
friend
gowing
may
drop
in
without
ceremony
so
may
cummings
who
lives
opposite
my
dear
wife
caroline
and
i
are
pleased
to
see
them
if
they
like
to
drop
in
on
us
but
carrie
and
i
can
manage
to
pass
our
evenings
together
without
friends
there
is
always
something
to
be
done
a
here
a
venetian
blind
to
put
straight
a
fan
to
nail
up
or
part
of
a
carpet
to
nail
of
which
i
can
do
with
my
pipe
in
my
mouth
while
carrie
is
not
above
putting
a
button
on
a
shirt
mending
a
or
practising
the
on
our
new
cottage
piano
on
the
three
system
manufactured
by
bilkson
in
small
letters
from
collard
and
collard
in
very
large
letters
it
is
also
a
great
comfort
to
us
to
know
that
our
boy
willie
is
getting
on
so
well
in
the
bank
at
oldham
we
should
like
to
see
more
of
him
now
for
my
diary
april
called
for
custom
and
i
promised
farmerson
the
ironmonger
to
give
him
a
turn
if
i
wanted
any
nails
or
tools
that
reminds
me
there
is
no
key
to
our
bedroom
door
and
the
bells
must
be
seen
to
the
parlour
bell
is
broken
and
the
front
door
rings
up
in
the
bedroom
which
is
ridiculous
dear
friend
gowing
dropped
in
but
stay
saying
there
was
an
infernal
smell
of
paint
april
tradesmen
still
calling
carrie
being
out
i
arranged
to
deal
with
horwin
who
seemed
a
civil
butcher
with
a
nice
clean
shop
ordered
a
shoulder
of
mutton
for
to
give
him
a
trial
carrie
arranged
with
borset
the
butterman
and
ordered
a
pound
of
fresh
butter
and
a
pound
and
a
half
of
salt
ditto
for
kitchen
and
a
worth
of
eggs
in
the
evening
cummings
unexpectedly
dropped
in
to
show
me
a
meerschaum
pipe
he
had
won
in
a
raffle
in
the
city
and
told
me
to
handle
it
carefully
as
it
would
spoil
the
colouring
if
the
hand
was
moist
he
said
he
stay
as
he
care
much
for
the
smell
of
the
paint
and
fell
over
the
scraper
as
he
went
out
must
get
the
scraper
removed
or
else
i
shall
get
into
a
i
often
make
jokes
april
shoulders
of
mutton
arrived
carrie
having
arranged
with
another
butcher
without
consulting
me
gowing
called
and
fell
over
scraper
coming
in
get
that
scraper
removed
april
for
breakfast
simply
shocking
sent
them
back
to
borset
with
my
compliments
and
he
call
any
more
for
orders
find
umbrella
and
though
it
was
pouring
with
rain
had
to
go
without
it
sarah
said
gowing
must
have
took
it
by
mistake
last
night
as
there
was
a
stick
in
the
that
belong
to
nobody
in
the
evening
hearing
someone
talking
in
a
loud
voice
to
the
servant
in
the
downstairs
hall
i
went
out
to
see
who
it
was
and
was
surprised
to
find
it
was
borset
the
butterman
who
was
both
drunk
and
offensive
borset
on
seeing
me
said
he
would
be
hanged
if
he
would
ever
serve
city
clerks
any
game
worth
the
candle
i
restrained
my
feelings
and
quietly
remarked
that
i
thought
it
was
for
a
city
clerk
to
be
a
he
replied
he
was
very
glad
to
hear
it
and
wanted
to
know
whether
i
had
ever
come
across
one
for
he
left
the
house
slamming
the
door
after
him
which
nearly
broke
the
fanlight
and
i
heard
him
fall
over
the
scraper
which
made
me
feel
glad
i
removed
it
when
he
had
gone
i
thought
of
a
splendid
answer
i
ought
to
have
given
him
however
i
will
keep
it
for
another
occasion
april
saturday
i
looked
forward
to
being
home
early
and
putting
a
few
things
straight
but
two
of
our
principals
at
the
office
were
absent
through
illness
and
i
did
not
get
home
till
seven
found
borset
waiting
he
had
been
three
times
during
the
day
to
apologise
for
his
conduct
last
night
he
said
he
was
unable
to
take
his
bank
holiday
last
monday
and
took
it
last
night
instead
he
begged
me
to
accept
his
apology
and
a
pound
of
fresh
butter
he
seems
after
all
a
decent
sort
of
fellow
so
i
gave
him
an
order
for
some
fresh
eggs
with
a
request
that
on
this
occasion
they
be
fresh
i
am
afraid
we
shall
have
to
get
some
new
after
all
our
old
ones
are
not
quite
wide
enough
to
meet
the
paint
on
either
side
carrie
suggests
that
we
might
ourselves
broaden
the
paint
i
will
see
if
we
can
match
the
colour
dark
chocolate
on
monday
april
church
the
curate
came
back
with
us
i
sent
carrie
in
to
open
front
door
which
we
do
not
use
except
on
special
occasions
she
could
not
get
it
open
and
after
all
my
display
i
had
to
take
the
curate
whose
name
i
did
not
catch
round
the
side
entrance
he
caught
his
foot
in
the
scraper
and
tore
the
bottom
of
his
trousers
most
annoying
as
carrie
could
not
well
offer
to
repair
them
on
a
sunday
after
dinner
went
to
sleep
took
a
walk
round
the
garden
and
discovered
a
beautiful
spot
for
sowing
and
radishes
went
to
church
again
in
the
evening
walked
back
with
the
curate
carrie
noticed
he
had
got
on
the
same
pair
of
trousers
only
repaired
he
wants
me
to
take
round
the
plate
which
i
think
a
great
compliment
chapter
ii
tradesmen
and
the
scraper
still
troublesome
gowing
rather
tiresome
with
his
complaints
of
the
paint
i
make
one
of
the
best
jokes
of
my
life
delights
of
gardening
stillbrook
gowing
cummings
and
i
have
a
little
misunderstanding
sarah
makes
me
look
a
fool
before
cummings
april
the
morning
badly
the
butcher
whom
we
decided
to
arrange
with
called
and
blackguarded
me
in
the
most
manner
he
began
by
abusing
me
and
saying
he
did
not
want
my
custom
i
simply
said
what
are
you
making
all
this
fuss
about
it
for
and
he
shouted
out
at
the
top
of
his
voice
so
that
all
the
neighbours
could
hear
go
along
ugh
i
could
buy
up
like
you
by
the
dozen
i
shut
the
door
and
was
giving
carrie
to
understand
that
this
disgraceful
scene
was
entirely
her
fault
when
there
was
a
violent
kicking
at
the
door
enough
to
break
the
panels
it
was
the
blackguard
butcher
again
who
said
he
had
cut
his
foot
over
the
scraper
and
would
immediately
bring
an
action
against
me
called
at
the
ironmonger
on
my
way
to
town
and
gave
him
the
job
of
moving
the
scraper
and
repairing
the
bells
thinking
it
scarcely
worth
while
to
trouble
the
landlord
with
such
a
trifling
matter
arrived
home
tired
and
worried
putley
a
painter
and
decorator
who
had
sent
in
a
card
said
he
could
not
match
the
colour
on
the
stairs
as
it
contained
indian
carmine
he
said
he
spent
calling
at
warehouses
to
see
if
he
could
get
it
he
suggested
he
should
entirely
repaint
the
stairs
it
would
cost
very
little
more
if
he
tried
to
match
it
he
could
only
make
a
bad
job
of
it
it
would
be
more
satisfactory
to
him
and
to
us
to
have
the
work
done
properly
i
consented
but
felt
i
had
been
talked
over
planted
some
and
radishes
and
went
to
bed
at
nine
april
came
round
to
attend
to
the
scraper
himself
he
seems
a
very
civil
fellow
he
says
he
does
not
usually
conduct
such
small
jobs
personally
but
for
me
he
would
do
so
i
thanked
him
and
went
to
town
it
is
disgraceful
how
late
some
of
the
young
clerks
are
at
arriving
i
told
three
of
them
that
if
perkupp
the
principal
heard
of
it
they
might
be
discharged
pitt
a
monkey
of
seventeen
who
has
only
been
with
us
six
weeks
told
me
keep
my
hair
on
i
informed
him
i
had
had
the
honour
of
being
in
the
firm
twenty
years
to
which
he
insolently
replied
that
i
i
gave
him
an
indignant
look
and
said
demand
from
you
some
respect
he
replied
right
go
on
i
would
not
argue
with
him
any
further
you
can
not
argue
with
people
like
that
in
the
evening
gowing
called
and
repeated
his
complaint
about
the
smell
of
paint
gowing
is
sometimes
very
tedious
with
his
remarks
and
not
always
cautious
and
carrie
once
very
properly
reminded
him
that
she
was
present
april
and
radishes
not
come
up
yet
was
a
day
of
annoyances
i
missed
the
to
the
city
through
having
words
with
the
boy
who
for
the
second
time
had
the
impertinence
to
bring
his
basket
to
the
and
had
left
the
marks
of
his
dirty
boots
on
the
he
said
he
had
knocked
at
the
side
door
with
his
knuckles
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
knew
sarah
our
servant
could
not
hear
this
as
she
was
upstairs
doing
the
bedrooms
so
asked
the
boy
why
he
did
not
ring
the
bell
he
replied
that
he
did
pull
the
bell
but
the
handle
came
off
in
his
hand
i
was
late
at
the
office
a
thing
that
has
never
happened
to
me
before
there
has
recently
been
much
irregularity
in
the
attendance
of
the
clerks
and
perkupp
our
principal
unfortunately
chose
this
very
morning
to
pounce
down
upon
us
early
someone
had
given
the
tip
to
the
others
the
result
was
that
i
was
the
only
one
late
of
the
lot
buckling
one
of
the
senior
clerks
was
a
brick
and
i
was
saved
by
his
intervention
as
i
passed
by
desk
i
heard
him
remark
to
his
neighbour
disgracefully
late
some
of
the
head
clerks
arrive
this
was
of
course
meant
for
me
i
treated
the
observation
with
silence
simply
giving
him
a
look
which
unfortunately
had
the
effect
of
making
both
of
the
clerks
laugh
thought
afterwards
it
would
have
been
more
dignified
if
i
had
pretended
not
to
have
heard
him
at
all
cummings
called
in
the
evening
and
we
played
dominoes
april
and
radishes
not
come
up
yet
left
farmerson
repairing
the
scraper
but
when
i
came
home
found
three
men
working
i
asked
the
meaning
of
it
and
farmerson
said
that
in
making
a
fresh
hole
he
had
penetrated
the
he
said
it
was
a
most
ridiculous
place
to
put
the
and
the
man
who
did
it
evidently
knew
nothing
about
his
business
i
felt
his
excuse
was
no
consolation
for
the
expense
i
shall
be
put
to
in
the
evening
after
tea
gowing
dropped
in
and
we
had
a
smoke
together
in
the
carrie
joined
us
later
but
did
not
stay
long
saying
the
smoke
was
too
much
for
her
it
was
also
rather
too
much
for
me
for
gowing
had
given
me
what
he
called
a
green
cigar
one
that
his
friend
shoemach
had
just
brought
over
from
america
the
cigar
look
green
but
i
fancy
i
must
have
done
so
for
when
i
had
smoked
a
little
more
than
half
i
was
obliged
to
retire
on
the
pretext
of
telling
sarah
to
bring
in
the
glasses
i
took
a
walk
round
the
garden
three
or
four
times
feeling
the
need
of
fresh
air
on
returning
gowing
noticed
i
was
not
smoking
offered
me
another
cigar
which
i
politely
declined
gowing
began
his
usual
sniffing
so
anticipating
him
i
said
not
going
to
complain
of
the
smell
of
paint
again
he
said
not
this
time
but
tell
you
what
i
distinctly
smell
dry
i
often
make
jokes
but
i
replied
talking
a
lot
of
i
could
not
help
roaring
at
this
and
carrie
said
her
sides
quite
ached
with
laughter
i
never
was
so
immensely
tickled
by
anything
i
have
ever
said
before
i
actually
woke
up
twice
during
the
night
and
laughed
till
the
bed
shook
april
extraordinary
coincidence
carrie
had
called
in
a
woman
to
make
some
chintz
covers
for
our
chairs
and
sofa
to
prevent
the
sun
fading
the
green
rep
of
the
furniture
i
saw
the
woman
and
recognised
her
as
a
woman
who
used
to
work
years
ago
for
my
old
aunt
at
clapham
it
only
shows
how
small
the
world
is
april
the
whole
of
the
afternoon
in
the
garden
having
this
morning
picked
up
at
a
bookstall
for
fivepence
a
capital
little
book
in
good
condition
on
i
procured
and
sowed
some
annuals
in
what
i
fancy
will
be
a
warm
sunny
border
i
thought
of
a
joke
and
called
out
carrie
carrie
came
out
rather
testy
i
thought
i
said
have
just
discovered
we
have
got
a
she
replied
do
you
mean
i
said
at
the
carrie
said
that
all
you
wanted
me
for
i
said
other
time
you
would
have
laughed
at
my
little
carrie
said
any
other
but
not
when
i
am
busy
in
the
the
stairs
looked
very
nice
gowing
called
and
said
the
stairs
looked
but
it
made
the
banisters
look
and
suggested
a
coat
of
paint
on
them
also
which
carrie
quite
agreed
with
i
walked
round
to
putley
and
fortunately
he
was
out
so
i
had
a
good
excuse
to
let
the
banisters
slide
that
is
rather
funny
april
three
cummings
and
gowing
called
for
a
good
long
walk
over
hampstead
and
finchley
and
brought
with
them
a
friend
named
stillbrook
we
walked
and
chatted
together
except
stillbrook
who
was
always
a
few
yards
behind
us
staring
at
the
ground
and
cutting
at
the
grass
with
his
stick
as
it
was
getting
on
for
five
we
four
held
a
consultation
and
gowing
suggested
that
we
should
make
for
cow
and
and
get
some
tea
stillbrook
said
was
good
enough
for
i
reminded
them
that
all
were
closed
till
six
stillbrook
said
all
we
arrived
and
as
i
was
trying
to
pass
the
man
in
charge
of
the
gate
said
from
i
replied
he
immediately
put
up
his
arm
and
declined
to
let
me
pass
i
turned
back
for
a
moment
when
i
saw
stillbrook
closely
followed
by
cummings
and
gowing
make
for
the
entrance
i
watched
them
and
thought
i
would
have
a
good
laugh
at
their
expense
i
heard
the
porter
say
from
when
to
my
surprise
in
fact
disgust
stillbrook
replied
and
the
three
were
immediately
admitted
gowing
called
to
me
across
the
gate
and
said
be
a
i
waited
for
them
the
best
part
of
an
hour
when
they
appeared
they
were
all
in
most
excellent
spirits
and
the
only
one
who
made
an
effort
to
apologise
was
stillbrook
who
said
to
me
was
very
rough
on
you
to
be
kept
waiting
but
we
had
another
spin
for
and
i
walked
home
in
silence
i
speak
to
them
i
felt
very
dull
all
the
evening
but
deemed
it
advisable
to
say
anything
to
carrie
about
the
matter
april
business
set
to
work
in
the
garden
when
it
got
dark
i
wrote
to
cummings
and
gowing
who
neither
called
for
a
wonder
perhaps
they
were
ashamed
of
themselves
about
adventure
at
cow
and
afterwards
made
up
my
mind
not
to
write
april
i
would
write
a
kind
little
note
to
gowing
and
cummings
about
last
sunday
and
warning
them
against
stillbrook
afterwards
thinking
the
matter
over
tore
up
the
letters
and
determined
not
to
at
all
but
to
quietly
to
them
dumfounded
at
receiving
a
sharp
letter
from
cummings
saying
that
both
he
and
gowing
had
been
waiting
for
an
explanation
of
mind
you
my
extraordinary
conduct
coming
home
on
sunday
at
last
i
wrote
thought
i
was
the
aggrieved
party
but
as
i
freely
forgive
you
yourself
bestow
forgiveness
on
i
have
copied
this
in
the
diary
because
i
think
it
is
one
of
the
most
perfect
and
thoughtful
sentences
i
have
ever
written
i
posted
the
letter
but
in
my
own
heart
i
felt
i
was
actually
apologising
for
having
been
insulted
april
in
for
a
cold
spent
the
whole
day
at
the
office
sneezing
in
the
evening
the
cold
being
intolerable
sent
sarah
out
for
a
bottle
of
kinahan
fell
asleep
in
the
and
woke
with
the
shivers
was
startled
by
a
loud
knock
at
the
front
door
carrie
awfully
flurried
sarah
still
out
so
went
up
opened
the
door
and
found
it
was
only
cummings
remembered
the
boy
had
again
broken
the
cummings
squeezed
my
hand
and
said
just
seen
gowing
all
right
say
no
more
about
there
is
no
doubt
they
are
both
under
the
impression
i
have
apologised
while
playing
dominoes
with
cummings
in
the
parlour
he
said
do
you
want
any
wine
or
spirits
my
cousin
merton
has
just
set
up
in
the
trade
and
has
a
splendid
whisky
four
years
in
bottle
at
shillings
it
is
worth
your
while
laying
down
a
few
dozen
of
i
told
him
my
cellars
which
were
very
small
were
full
up
to
my
horror
at
that
very
moment
sarah
entered
the
room
and
putting
a
bottle
of
whisky
wrapped
in
a
dirty
piece
of
newspaper
on
the
table
in
front
of
us
said
sir
the
grocer
says
he
got
no
more
kinahan
but
find
this
very
good
at
with
twopence
returned
on
the
bottle
and
please
did
you
want
any
more
sherry
as
he
has
some
at
as
dry
as
a
nut
chapter
iii
a
conversation
with
merton
on
society
and
james
of
sutton
come
up
a
miserable
evening
at
the
tank
theatre
experiments
with
enamel
paint
i
make
another
good
joke
but
gowing
and
cummings
are
unnecessarily
offended
i
paint
the
bath
red
with
unexpected
result
april
called
bringing
with
him
his
friend
merton
who
is
in
the
wine
trade
gowing
also
called
merton
made
himself
at
home
at
once
and
carrie
and
i
were
both
struck
with
him
immediately
and
thoroughly
approved
of
his
sentiments
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
said
must
take
me
as
i
am
and
i
replied
you
must
take
us
as
we
are
homely
people
we
are
not
he
answered
i
can
see
that
and
gowing
roared
with
laughter
but
merton
in
a
most
gentlemanly
manner
said
to
gowing
think
you
quite
understand
me
i
intended
to
convey
that
our
charming
host
and
hostess
were
superior
to
the
follies
of
fashion
and
preferred
leading
a
simple
and
wholesome
life
to
gadding
about
to
afternoons
and
living
above
their
i
was
immensely
pleased
with
these
sensible
remarks
of
and
concluded
that
subject
by
saying
candidly
merton
we
go
into
society
because
we
do
not
care
for
it
and
what
with
the
expense
of
cabs
here
and
cabs
there
and
white
gloves
and
white
ties
it
seem
worth
the
merton
said
in
reference
to
motto
is
and
true
and
by
the
way
i
also
apply
that
to
wine
and
gowing
said
and
sometimes
and
tasty
eh
old
man
merton
still
continuing
said
he
should
treat
me
as
a
friend
and
put
me
down
for
a
dozen
of
his
whisky
and
as
i
was
an
old
friend
of
gowing
i
should
have
it
for
which
was
considerably
under
what
he
paid
for
it
he
booked
his
own
order
and
further
said
that
at
any
time
i
wanted
any
passes
for
the
theatre
i
was
to
let
him
know
as
his
name
stood
good
for
any
theatre
in
london
april
reminded
me
that
as
her
old
school
friend
annie
fullers
now
james
and
her
husband
had
come
up
from
sutton
for
a
few
days
it
would
look
kind
to
take
them
to
the
theatre
and
would
i
drop
a
line
to
merton
asking
him
for
passes
for
four
either
for
the
italian
opera
haymarket
savoy
or
lyceum
i
wrote
merton
to
that
effect
april
a
reply
from
merton
saying
he
was
very
busy
and
just
at
present
manage
passes
for
the
italian
opera
haymarket
savoy
or
lyceum
but
the
best
thing
going
on
in
london
was
the
at
the
tank
theatre
islington
and
enclosed
seats
for
four
also
bill
for
whisky
april
and
james
miss
fullers
that
was
came
to
meat
tea
and
we
left
directly
after
for
the
tank
theatre
we
got
a
that
took
us
to
cross
and
then
changed
into
one
that
took
us
to
the
james
each
time
insisted
on
paying
for
all
saying
that
i
had
paid
for
the
tickets
and
that
was
quite
enough
we
arrived
at
theatre
where
curiously
enough
all
our
except
an
old
woman
with
a
basket
seemed
to
be
going
in
i
walked
ahead
and
presented
the
tickets
the
man
looked
at
them
and
called
out
willowly
do
you
know
anything
about
these
holding
up
my
tickets
the
gentleman
called
to
came
up
and
examined
my
tickets
and
said
gave
you
these
i
said
rather
indignantly
merton
of
he
said
he
i
answered
rather
sharply
ought
to
know
his
good
at
any
theatre
in
he
replied
is
it
well
it
no
good
here
these
tickets
which
are
not
dated
were
issued
under
management
which
has
since
changed
while
i
was
having
some
very
unpleasant
words
with
the
man
james
who
had
gone
upstairs
with
the
ladies
called
out
on
i
went
up
after
them
and
a
very
civil
attendant
said
way
please
box
i
said
to
james
how
on
earth
did
you
manage
it
and
to
my
horror
he
replied
paid
for
it
of
this
was
humiliating
enough
and
i
could
scarcely
follow
the
play
but
i
was
doomed
to
still
further
humiliation
i
was
leaning
out
of
the
box
when
my
little
black
bow
which
fastened
on
to
the
stud
by
means
of
a
new
into
the
pit
below
a
clumsy
man
not
noticing
it
had
his
foot
on
it
for
ever
so
long
before
he
discovered
it
he
then
picked
it
up
and
eventually
flung
it
under
the
next
seat
in
disgust
what
with
the
box
incident
and
the
tie
i
felt
quite
miserable
james
of
sutton
was
very
good
he
said
one
will
notice
it
with
your
beard
that
is
the
only
advantage
of
growing
one
that
i
can
there
was
no
occasion
for
that
remark
for
carrie
is
very
proud
of
my
beard
to
hide
the
absence
of
the
tie
i
had
to
keep
my
chin
down
the
rest
of
the
evening
which
caused
a
pain
at
the
back
of
my
neck
april
scarcely
sleep
a
wink
through
thinking
of
having
brought
up
and
james
from
the
country
to
go
to
the
theatre
last
night
and
his
having
paid
for
a
private
box
because
our
order
was
not
honoured
and
such
a
poor
play
too
i
wrote
a
very
satirical
letter
to
merton
the
wine
merchant
who
gave
us
the
pass
and
said
we
had
to
pay
for
our
seats
we
did
our
best
to
appreciate
the
i
thought
this
line
rather
cutting
and
i
asked
carrie
how
many
there
were
in
appreciate
and
she
said
after
i
sent
off
the
letter
i
looked
at
the
dictionary
and
found
there
were
two
awfully
vexed
at
this
decided
not
to
worry
myself
any
more
about
the
for
as
carrie
wisely
said
make
it
all
right
with
them
by
asking
them
up
from
sutton
one
evening
next
week
to
play
at
april
consequence
of
brickwell
telling
me
his
wife
was
working
wonders
with
the
new
enamel
paint
i
determined
to
try
it
i
bought
two
tins
of
red
on
my
way
home
i
hastened
through
tea
went
into
the
garden
and
painted
some
i
called
out
carrie
who
said
always
got
some
newfangled
craze
but
she
was
obliged
to
admit
that
the
looked
remarkably
well
went
upstairs
into
the
bedroom
and
painted
her
washstand
and
chest
of
drawers
to
my
mind
it
was
an
extraordinary
improvement
but
as
an
example
of
the
ignorance
of
the
lower
classes
in
the
matter
of
taste
our
servant
sarah
on
seeing
them
evinced
no
sign
of
pleasure
but
merely
said
thought
they
looked
very
well
as
they
was
april
some
more
red
enamel
paint
red
to
my
mind
being
the
best
colour
and
painted
the
and
the
backs
of
our
the
binding
of
which
had
almost
worn
out
april
the
bath
red
and
was
delighted
with
the
result
sorry
to
say
carrie
was
not
in
fact
we
had
a
few
words
about
it
she
said
i
ought
to
have
consulted
her
and
she
had
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
as
a
bath
being
painted
red
i
replied
merely
a
matter
of
fortunately
further
argument
on
the
subject
was
stopped
by
a
voice
saying
i
come
in
it
was
only
cummings
who
said
maid
opened
the
door
and
asked
me
to
excuse
her
showing
me
in
as
she
was
wringing
out
some
i
was
delighted
to
see
him
and
suggested
we
should
have
a
game
of
whist
with
a
dummy
and
by
way
of
merriment
said
can
be
the
cummings
i
thought
rather
replied
as
he
said
he
stop
he
only
called
to
leave
me
the
as
he
had
done
with
it
another
ring
at
the
bell
it
was
gowing
who
said
he
apologise
for
coming
so
often
and
that
one
of
these
days
we
must
come
round
to
i
said
very
extraordinary
thing
has
struck
funny
as
usual
said
cummings
i
replied
think
even
you
will
say
so
this
time
concerning
you
both
for
it
seem
odd
that
always
coming
and
always
going
carrie
who
had
evidently
quite
forgotten
about
the
bath
went
into
fits
of
laughter
and
as
for
myself
i
fairly
doubled
up
in
my
chair
till
it
cracked
beneath
me
i
think
this
was
one
of
the
best
jokes
i
have
ever
made
then
imagine
my
astonishment
on
perceiving
both
cummings
and
gowing
perfectly
silent
and
without
a
smile
on
their
faces
after
rather
an
unpleasant
pause
cummings
who
had
opened
a
closed
it
up
again
and
said
think
after
that
i
be
going
and
i
am
sorry
i
fail
to
see
the
fun
of
your
gowing
said
he
mind
a
joke
when
it
rude
but
a
pun
on
a
name
to
his
thinking
was
certainly
a
little
wanting
in
good
taste
cummings
followed
it
up
by
saying
if
it
had
been
said
by
anyone
else
but
myself
he
have
entered
the
house
again
this
rather
unpleasantly
terminated
what
might
have
been
a
cheerful
evening
however
it
was
as
well
they
went
for
the
charwoman
had
finished
up
the
remains
of
the
cold
pork
april
the
office
the
new
and
very
young
clerk
pitt
who
was
very
impudent
to
me
a
week
or
so
ago
was
late
again
i
told
him
it
would
be
my
duty
to
inform
perkupp
the
principal
to
my
surprise
pitt
apologised
most
humbly
and
in
a
most
gentlemanly
fashion
i
was
unfeignedly
pleased
to
notice
this
improvement
in
his
manner
towards
me
and
told
him
i
would
look
over
his
unpunctuality
passing
down
the
room
an
hour
later
i
received
a
smart
smack
in
the
face
from
a
ball
of
hard
foolscap
i
turned
round
sharply
but
all
the
clerks
were
apparently
riveted
to
their
work
i
am
not
a
rich
man
but
i
would
give
to
know
whether
that
was
thrown
by
accident
or
design
went
home
early
and
bought
some
more
enamel
this
spent
the
evening
touching
up
the
fender
and
an
old
pair
of
boots
making
them
look
as
good
as
new
also
painted
which
he
left
behind
and
made
it
look
like
ebony
april
up
with
a
fearful
headache
and
strong
symptoms
of
a
cold
carrie
with
a
perversity
which
is
just
like
her
said
it
was
colic
and
was
the
result
of
my
having
spent
the
last
few
days
with
my
nose
over
a
i
told
her
firmly
that
i
knew
a
great
deal
better
what
was
the
matter
with
me
than
she
did
i
had
got
a
chill
and
decided
to
have
a
bath
as
hot
as
i
could
bear
it
bath
scarcely
bear
it
so
hot
i
persevered
and
got
in
very
hot
but
very
acceptable
i
lay
still
for
some
time
on
moving
my
hand
above
the
surface
of
the
water
i
experienced
the
greatest
fright
i
ever
received
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
for
imagine
my
horror
on
discovering
my
hand
as
i
thought
full
of
blood
my
first
thought
was
that
i
had
ruptured
an
artery
and
was
bleeding
to
death
and
should
be
discovered
later
on
looking
like
a
second
marat
as
i
remember
seeing
him
in
madame
my
second
thought
was
to
ring
the
bell
but
remembered
there
was
no
bell
to
ring
my
third
was
that
there
was
nothing
but
the
enamel
paint
which
had
dissolved
with
boiling
water
i
stepped
out
of
the
bath
perfectly
red
all
over
resembling
the
red
indians
i
have
seen
depicted
at
an
theatre
i
determined
not
to
say
a
word
to
carrie
but
to
tell
farmerson
to
come
on
monday
and
paint
the
bath
white
chapter
iv
the
ball
at
the
mansion
house
april
astounded
at
receiving
an
invitation
for
carrie
and
myself
from
the
lord
and
lady
mayoress
to
the
mansion
house
to
the
representatives
of
trades
and
my
heart
beat
like
that
of
a
carrie
and
i
read
the
invitation
over
two
or
three
times
i
could
scarcely
eat
my
breakfast
i
i
felt
it
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
darling
i
was
a
proud
man
when
i
led
you
down
the
aisle
of
the
church
on
our
that
pride
will
be
equalled
if
not
surpassed
when
i
lead
my
dear
pretty
wife
up
to
the
lord
and
lady
mayoress
at
the
mansion
i
saw
the
tears
in
eyes
and
she
said
dear
it
is
who
have
to
be
proud
of
you
and
i
am
very
very
proud
of
you
you
have
called
me
pretty
and
as
long
as
i
am
pretty
in
your
eyes
i
am
happy
you
dear
old
charlie
are
not
handsome
but
you
are
which
is
far
more
i
gave
her
a
kiss
and
she
said
wonder
if
there
will
be
any
dancing
i
have
not
danced
with
you
for
i
can
not
tell
what
induced
me
to
do
it
but
i
seized
her
round
the
waist
and
we
were
silly
enough
to
be
executing
a
wild
kind
of
polka
when
sarah
entered
grinning
and
said
is
a
man
mum
at
the
door
who
wants
to
know
if
you
want
any
good
most
annoyed
at
this
spent
the
evening
in
answering
and
tearing
up
again
the
reply
to
the
mansion
house
having
left
word
with
sarah
if
gowing
or
cummings
called
we
were
not
at
home
must
consult
perkupp
how
to
answer
the
lord
invitation
may
said
should
like
to
send
mother
the
invitation
to
look
i
consented
as
soon
as
i
had
answered
it
i
told
perkupp
at
the
office
with
a
feeling
of
pride
that
we
had
received
an
invitation
to
the
mansion
house
and
he
said
to
my
astonishment
that
he
himself
gave
in
my
name
to
the
lord
secretary
i
felt
this
rather
discounted
the
value
of
the
invitation
but
i
thanked
him
and
in
reply
to
me
he
described
how
i
was
to
answer
it
i
felt
the
reply
was
too
simple
but
of
course
perkupp
knows
best
may
my
and
trousers
to
the
little
round
the
corner
to
have
the
creases
taken
out
told
gowing
not
to
call
next
monday
as
we
were
going
to
the
mansion
house
sent
similar
note
to
cummings
may
went
to
james
at
sutton
to
consult
about
her
dress
for
next
monday
while
speaking
incidentally
to
spotch
one
of
our
head
clerks
about
the
mansion
house
he
said
asked
but
think
i
shall
when
a
vulgar
man
like
spotch
is
asked
i
feel
my
invitation
is
considerably
discounted
in
the
evening
while
i
was
out
the
little
tailor
brought
round
my
coat
and
trousers
and
because
sarah
had
not
a
shilling
to
pay
for
the
pressing
he
took
them
away
again
may
mother
returned
the
lord
invitation
which
was
sent
to
her
to
look
at
with
apologies
for
having
upset
a
glass
of
port
over
it
i
was
too
angry
to
say
anything
may
a
pair
of
lavender
for
next
monday
and
two
white
ties
in
case
one
got
spoiled
in
the
tying
may
very
dull
sermon
during
which
i
regret
to
say
i
twice
thought
of
the
mansion
house
reception
may
big
day
the
lord
reception
the
whole
house
upset
i
had
to
get
dressed
at
six
as
carrie
wanted
the
room
to
herself
james
had
come
up
from
sutton
to
help
carrie
so
i
could
not
help
thinking
it
unreasonable
that
she
should
require
the
entire
attention
of
sarah
the
servant
as
well
sarah
kept
running
out
of
the
house
to
fetch
for
missis
and
several
times
i
had
in
my
full
to
answer
the
the
last
time
it
was
the
boy
who
not
seeing
it
was
me
for
sarah
had
not
lighted
the
gas
pushed
into
my
hands
two
cabbages
and
i
indignantly
threw
them
on
the
ground
and
felt
so
annoyed
that
i
so
far
forgot
myself
as
to
box
the
ears
he
went
away
crying
and
said
he
should
summons
me
a
thing
i
would
not
have
happen
for
the
world
in
the
dark
i
stepped
on
a
piece
of
the
cabbage
which
brought
me
down
on
the
flags
all
of
a
heap
for
a
moment
i
was
stunned
but
when
i
recovered
i
crawled
upstairs
into
the
and
on
looking
into
the
discovered
that
my
chin
was
bleeding
my
shirt
smeared
with
the
and
my
left
trouser
torn
at
the
knee
however
james
brought
me
down
another
shirt
which
i
changed
in
the
i
put
a
piece
of
on
my
chin
and
sarah
very
neatly
sewed
up
the
tear
at
the
knee
at
nine
carrie
swept
into
the
room
looking
like
a
queen
never
have
i
seen
her
look
so
lovely
or
so
distinguished
she
was
wearing
a
satin
dress
of
favourite
a
piece
of
lace
which
james
lent
her
round
the
shoulders
to
give
a
finish
i
thought
perhaps
the
dress
was
a
little
too
long
behind
and
decidedly
too
short
in
front
but
james
said
it
was
la
james
was
most
kind
and
lent
carrie
a
fan
of
ivory
with
red
feathers
the
value
of
which
she
said
was
priceless
as
the
feathers
belonged
to
the
kachu
bird
now
extinct
i
preferred
the
little
white
fan
which
carrie
bought
for
at
but
both
ladies
sat
on
me
at
once
we
arrived
at
the
mansion
house
too
early
which
was
rather
fortunate
for
i
had
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
his
lordship
who
graciously
condescended
to
talk
with
me
some
minutes
but
i
must
say
i
was
disappointed
to
find
he
did
not
even
know
perkupp
our
principal
i
felt
as
if
we
had
been
invited
to
the
mansion
house
by
one
who
did
not
know
the
lord
mayor
himself
crowds
arrived
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
grand
sight
my
humble
pen
can
never
describe
it
i
was
a
little
annoyed
with
carrie
who
kept
saying
it
a
pity
we
know
anybody
once
she
quite
lost
her
head
i
saw
someone
who
looked
like
franching
from
peckham
and
was
moving
towards
him
when
she
seized
me
by
the
and
said
quite
loudly
leave
me
which
caused
an
elderly
gentleman
in
a
and
a
chain
round
him
and
two
ladies
to
burst
out
laughing
there
was
an
immense
crowd
in
the
and
my
stars
it
was
a
splendid
amount
of
champagne
carrie
made
a
most
hearty
supper
for
which
i
was
pleased
for
i
sometimes
think
she
is
not
strong
there
was
scarcely
a
dish
she
did
not
taste
i
was
so
thirsty
i
could
not
eat
much
receiving
a
sharp
slap
on
the
shoulder
i
turned
and
to
my
amazement
saw
farmerson
our
ironmonger
he
said
in
the
most
familiar
way
is
better
than
brickfield
terrace
eh
i
simply
looked
at
him
and
said
coolly
never
expected
to
see
you
he
said
with
a
loud
coarse
laugh
like
why
not
i
replied
i
wish
i
could
have
thought
of
something
better
to
say
he
said
i
get
your
good
lady
anything
carrie
said
i
thank
you
for
which
i
was
pleased
i
said
by
way
of
reproof
to
him
never
sent
to
paint
the
bath
as
i
farmerson
said
me
pooter
no
shop
when
in
company
before
i
could
think
of
a
reply
one
of
the
sheriffs
in
full
court
costume
slapped
farmerson
on
the
back
and
hailed
him
as
an
old
friend
and
asked
him
to
dine
with
him
at
his
lodge
i
was
astonished
for
full
five
minutes
they
stood
roaring
with
laughter
and
stood
digging
each
other
in
the
ribs
they
kept
telling
each
other
they
look
a
day
older
they
began
embracing
each
other
and
drinking
champagne
to
think
that
a
man
who
mends
our
scraper
should
know
any
member
of
our
aristocracy
i
was
just
moving
with
carrie
when
farmerson
seized
me
rather
roughly
by
the
collar
and
addressing
the
sheriff
said
me
introduce
my
neighbour
he
did
not
even
say
the
sheriff
handed
me
a
glass
of
champagne
i
felt
after
all
it
was
a
great
honour
to
drink
a
glass
of
wine
with
him
and
i
told
him
so
we
stood
chatting
for
some
time
and
at
last
i
said
must
excuse
me
now
if
i
join
when
i
approached
her
she
said
let
me
take
you
away
from
friends
i
am
quite
happy
standing
here
alone
in
a
crowd
knowing
nobody
as
it
takes
two
to
make
a
quarrel
and
as
it
was
neither
the
time
nor
the
place
for
it
i
gave
my
arm
to
carrie
and
said
hope
my
darling
little
wife
will
dance
with
me
if
only
for
the
sake
of
saying
we
had
danced
at
the
mansion
house
as
guests
of
the
lord
finding
the
dancing
after
supper
was
less
formal
and
knowing
how
much
carrie
used
to
admire
my
dancing
in
the
days
gone
by
i
put
my
arm
round
her
waist
and
we
commenced
a
waltz
a
most
unfortunate
accident
occurred
i
had
got
on
a
new
pair
of
boots
foolishly
i
had
omitted
to
take
advice
namely
to
scratch
the
soles
of
them
with
the
points
of
the
scissors
or
to
put
a
little
wet
on
them
i
had
scarcely
started
when
like
lightning
my
left
foot
slipped
away
and
i
came
down
the
side
of
my
head
striking
the
floor
with
such
violence
that
for
a
second
or
two
i
did
not
know
what
had
happened
i
needly
hardly
say
that
carrie
fell
with
me
with
equal
violence
breaking
the
comb
in
her
hair
and
grazing
her
elbow
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
which
was
immediately
checked
when
people
found
that
we
had
really
hurt
ourselves
a
gentleman
assisted
carrie
to
a
seat
and
i
expressed
myself
pretty
strongly
on
the
danger
of
having
a
plain
polished
floor
with
no
carpet
or
drugget
to
prevent
people
slipping
the
gentleman
who
said
his
name
was
darwitts
insisted
on
escorting
carrie
to
have
a
glass
of
wine
an
invitation
which
i
was
pleased
to
allow
carrie
to
accept
i
followed
and
met
farmerson
who
immediately
said
in
his
loud
voice
are
you
the
one
who
went
down
i
answered
with
an
indignant
look
with
execrable
taste
he
said
here
old
man
we
are
too
old
for
this
game
we
must
leave
these
capers
to
the
youngsters
come
and
have
another
glass
that
is
more
in
our
although
i
felt
i
was
buying
his
silence
by
accepting
we
followed
the
others
into
the
neither
carrie
nor
i
after
our
unfortunate
mishap
felt
inclined
to
stay
longer
as
we
were
departing
farmerson
said
you
going
if
so
you
might
give
me
a
i
thought
it
better
to
consent
but
wish
i
had
first
consulted
carrie
chapter
v
after
the
mansion
house
ball
carrie
offended
gowing
also
offended
a
pleasant
party
at
the
franching
of
peckham
visits
us
may
woke
up
with
a
most
terrible
headache
i
could
scarcely
see
and
the
back
of
my
neck
was
as
if
i
had
given
it
a
crick
i
thought
first
of
sending
for
a
doctor
but
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
when
up
i
felt
faint
and
went
to
the
chemist
who
gave
me
a
draught
so
bad
at
the
office
had
to
get
leave
to
come
home
went
to
another
chemist
in
the
city
and
i
got
a
draught
dose
seems
to
have
made
me
worse
have
eaten
nothing
all
day
to
make
matters
worse
carrie
every
time
i
spoke
to
her
answered
me
is
when
she
answered
at
all
in
the
evening
i
felt
very
much
worse
again
and
said
to
her
do
believe
been
poisoned
by
the
lobster
mayonnaise
at
the
mansion
house
last
night
she
simply
replied
without
taking
her
eyes
from
her
sewing
never
did
agree
with
i
felt
irritated
and
said
nonsense
you
talk
i
only
had
a
glass
and
a
half
and
you
know
as
well
as
i
before
i
could
complete
the
sentence
she
bounced
out
of
the
room
i
sat
over
an
hour
waiting
for
her
to
return
but
as
she
did
not
i
determined
i
would
go
to
bed
i
discovered
carrie
had
gone
to
bed
without
even
saying
leaving
me
to
bar
the
scullery
door
and
feed
the
cat
i
shall
certainly
speak
to
her
about
this
in
the
morning
may
a
little
shaky
with
black
specks
the
contains
a
long
list
of
the
guests
at
the
mansion
house
ball
disappointed
to
find
our
names
omitted
though
is
in
plainly
enough
with
after
it
whatever
that
may
mean
more
than
vexed
because
we
had
ordered
a
dozen
copies
to
send
to
our
friends
wrote
to
the
pointing
out
their
omission
carrie
had
commenced
her
breakfast
when
i
entered
the
parlour
i
helped
myself
to
a
cup
of
tea
and
i
said
perfectly
calmly
and
quietly
i
wish
a
little
explanation
of
your
conduct
last
she
replied
and
i
desire
something
more
than
a
little
explanation
of
your
conduct
the
night
i
said
coolly
i
understand
carrie
said
sneeringly
not
you
were
scarcely
in
a
condition
to
understand
i
was
astounded
at
this
insinuation
and
simply
ejaculated
she
said
be
theatrical
it
has
no
effect
on
me
reserve
that
tone
for
your
new
friend
mister
farmerson
the
i
was
about
to
speak
when
carrie
in
a
temper
such
as
i
have
never
seen
her
in
before
told
me
to
hold
my
tongue
she
said
going
to
say
something
after
professing
to
snub
farmerson
you
permit
him
to
snub
in
my
presence
and
then
accept
his
invitation
to
take
a
glass
of
champagne
with
you
and
you
limit
yourself
to
one
glass
you
then
offer
this
vulgar
man
who
made
a
bungle
of
repairing
our
scraper
a
seat
in
our
cab
on
the
way
home
i
say
nothing
about
his
tearing
my
dress
in
getting
in
the
cab
nor
of
treading
on
expensive
fan
which
you
knocked
out
of
my
hand
and
for
which
he
never
even
apologised
but
you
smoked
all
the
way
home
without
having
the
decency
to
ask
my
permission
that
is
not
all
at
the
end
of
the
journey
although
he
did
not
offer
you
a
farthing
towards
his
share
of
the
cab
you
asked
him
in
fortunately
he
was
sober
enough
to
detect
from
my
manner
that
his
company
was
not
goodness
knows
i
felt
humiliated
enough
at
this
but
to
make
matters
worse
gowing
entered
the
room
without
knocking
with
two
hats
on
his
head
and
holding
the
in
his
hand
with
fur
tippet
which
he
had
taken
off
the
downstairs
round
his
neck
and
announced
himself
in
a
loud
coarse
voice
royal
highness
the
lord
mayor
he
marched
twice
round
the
room
like
a
buffoon
and
finding
we
took
no
notice
said
up
quarrel
eh
there
was
a
silence
for
a
moment
so
i
said
quietly
dear
gowing
not
very
well
and
not
quite
in
the
humour
for
joking
especially
when
you
enter
the
room
without
knocking
an
act
which
i
fail
to
see
the
fun
gowing
said
very
sorry
but
i
called
for
my
stick
which
i
thought
you
would
have
sent
i
handed
him
his
stick
which
i
remembered
i
had
painted
black
with
the
enamel
paint
thinking
to
improve
it
he
looked
at
it
for
a
minute
with
a
dazed
expression
and
said
did
this
i
said
did
what
he
said
what
why
destroyed
my
stick
it
belonged
to
my
poor
uncle
and
i
value
it
more
than
anything
i
have
in
the
world
know
who
did
i
said
very
sorry
i
dare
say
it
will
come
off
i
did
it
for
the
gowing
said
all
i
can
say
is
a
confounded
liberty
and
i
add
a
bigger
fool
than
you
look
only
absolutely
may
a
single
copy
of
the
there
was
a
short
list
of
several
names
they
had
omitted
but
the
stupid
people
had
mentioned
our
names
as
and
most
annoying
wrote
again
and
i
took
particular
care
to
write
our
name
in
capital
letters
so
that
there
should
be
no
possible
mistake
this
time
may
disgusted
on
opening
the
of
to
find
the
following
paragraph
have
received
two
letters
from
and
charles
pewter
requesting
us
to
announce
the
important
fact
that
they
were
at
the
mansion
house
i
tore
up
the
paper
and
threw
it
in
the
basket
my
time
is
far
too
valuable
to
bother
about
such
trifles
may
last
week
or
ten
days
terribly
dull
carrie
being
away
at
at
sutton
cummings
also
away
gowing
i
presume
is
still
offended
with
me
for
black
enamelling
his
stick
without
asking
him
may
a
new
stick
mounted
with
silver
which
cost
shall
tell
carrie
five
shillings
and
sent
it
round
with
nice
note
to
gowing
may
strange
note
from
gowing
he
said
not
a
bit
my
thought
you
were
offended
with
me
for
losing
my
temper
besides
i
found
after
all
it
was
not
my
poor
old
stick
you
painted
it
was
only
a
shilling
thing
i
bought
at
a
however
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
handsome
present
all
may
back

she
looks
wonderfully
well
except
that
the
sun
has
caught
her
nose
may
brought
down
some
of
my
shirts
and
advised
me
to
take
them
to
round
the
corner
she
said
fronts
and
cuffs
are
much
i
said
without
a
hesitation
they
lor
how
we
roared
i
thought
we
should
never
stop
laughing
as
i
happened
to
be
sitting
next
the
driver
going
to
town
on
the
i
told
him
my
joke
about
the
shirts
i
thought
he
would
have
rolled
off
his
seat
they
laughed
at
the
office
a
good
bit
too
over
it
may
the
shirts
to
be
repaired
at
i
said
to
him
they
are
he
said
without
a
smile
bound
to
do
that
some
people
seem
to
be
quite
destitute
of
a
sense
of
humour
june
last
week
has
been
like
old
times
carrie
being
back
and
gowing
and
cummings
calling
every
evening
nearly
twice
we
sat
out
in
the
garden
quite
late
this
evening
we
were
like
a
pack
of
children
and
played
it
is
a
good
game
june
again
this
evening
not
quite
so
successful
as
last
night
gowing
having
several
times
overstepped
the
limits
of
good
taste
june
the
evening
carrie
and
i
went
round
to
and
to
spend
a
quiet
evening
with
them
gowing
was
there
also
stillbrook
it
was
quiet
but
pleasant
cummings
sang
five
or
six
songs
sir
and
garden
of
sleep
being
best
in
my
humble
judgment
but
what
pleased
me
most
was
the
duet
she
sang
with
duet
too
i
think
it
is
called
would
that
my
love
it
was
beautiful
if
carrie
had
been
in
better
voice
i
think
professionals
could
have
sung
it
better
after
supper
we
made
them
sing
it
again
i
never
liked
stillbrook
since
the
walk
that
sunday
to
the
and
hedge
but
i
must
say
he
sings
well
his
song
want
the
old
men
now
made
us
shriek
with
laughter
especially
the
verse
referring
to
gladstone
but
there
was
one
verse
i
think
he
might
have
omitted
and
i
said
so
but
gowing
thought
it
was
the
best
of
the
lot
june
brought
round
the
shirts
and
to
my
disgust
his
charge
for
repairing
was
more
than
i
gave
for
them
when
new
i
told
him
so
and
he
impertinently
replied
they
are
better
now
than
when
they
were
i
paid
him
and
said
it
was
a
robbery
he
said
you
wanted
your
made
out
of
such
as
is
used
for
packing
and
bookbinding
why
you
say
so
june
dreadful
annoyance
met
franching
who
lives
at
peckham
and
who
is
a
great
swell
in
his
way
i
ventured
to
ask
him
to
come
home
to
and
take
i
did
not
think
he
would
accept
such
a
humble
invitation
but
he
did
saying
in
a
most
friendly
way
he
would
rather
with
us
than
by
himself
i
said
had
better
get
into
this
blue
he
replied
for
me
i
have
had
enough
of
the
blues
lately
i
lost
a
cool
over
the
copper
scare
step
in
we
drove
up
home
in
style
in
a
and
i
knocked
three
times
at
the
front
door
without
getting
an
answer
i
saw
carrie
through
the
panels
of
with
stars
rushing
upstairs
i
told
franching
to
wait
at
the
door
while
i
went
round
to
the
side
there
i
saw
the
boy
actually
picking
off
the
paint
on
the
door
which
had
formed
into
blisters
no
time
to
reprove
him
so
went
round
and
effected
an
entrance
through
the
kitchen
window
i
let
in
franching
and
showed
him
into
the
i
went
upstairs
to
carrie
who
was
changing
her
dress
and
told
her
i
had
persuaded
franching
to
come
home
she
replied
can
you
do
such
a
thing
you
know
holiday
and
not
a
thing
in
the
house
the
cold
mutton
having
turned
with
the
hot
eventually
carrie
like
a
good
creature
as
she
is
slipped
down
washed
up
the
teacups
and
laid
the
cloth
and
i
gave
franching
our
views
of
japan
to
look
at
while
i
ran
round
to
the
to
get
three
chops
july
miserable
cold
weather
is
either
upsetting
me
or
carrie
or
both
we
seem
to
break
out
into
an
argument
about
absolutely
nothing
and
this
unpleasant
state
of
things
usually
occurs
at
this
morning
for
some
unaccountable
reason
we
were
talking
about
balloons
and
we
were
as
merry
as
possible
but
the
conversation
drifted
into
family
matters
during
which
carrie
without
the
slightest
reason
referred
in
the
most
uncomplimentary
manner
to
my
poor
pecuniary
trouble
i
retorted
by
saying
that
at
all
events
was
a
gentleman
whereupon
carrie
burst
out
crying
i
positively
could
not
eat
any
breakfast
at
the
office
i
was
sent
for
by
perkupp
who
said
he
was
very
sorry
but
i
should
have
to
take
my
annual
holidays
from
next
saturday
franching
called
at
office
and
asked
me
to
dine
at
his
club
fearing
disagreeables
at
home
after
the
this
morning
i
sent
a
telegram
to
carrie
telling
her
i
was
going
out
to
dine
and
she
was
not
to
sit
up
bought
a
little
silver
bangle
for
carrie
july
was
very
pleased
with
the
bangle
which
i
left
with
an
affectionate
note
on
her
last
night
before
going
to
bed
i
told
carrie
we
should
have
to
start
for
our
holiday
next
saturday
she
replied
quite
happily
that
she
did
not
mind
except
that
the
weather
was
so
bad
and
she
feared
that
miss
jibbons
would
not
be
able
to
get
her
a
seaside
dress
in
time
i
told
carrie
that
i
thought
the
drab
one
with
pink
bows
looked
quite
good
enough
and
carrie
said
she
should
not
think
of
wearing
it
i
was
about
to
discuss
the
matter
when
remembering
the
argument
yesterday
resolved
to
hold
my
tongue
i
said
to
carrie
think
we
can
do
better
than
old
carrie
not
only
to
my
astonishment
raised
an
objection
to
broadstairs
for
the
first
time
but
begged
me
not
to
use
the
expression
old
but
to
leave
it
to
stillbrook
and
other
of
his
type
hearing
my
pass
the
window
i
was
obliged
to
rush
out
of
the
house
without
kissing
carrie
as
usual
and
i
shouted
to
her
leave
it
to
you
to
on
returning
in
the
evening
carrie
said
she
thought
as
the
time
was
so
short
she
had
decided
on
broadstairs
and
had
written
to
beck
harbour
view
terrace
for
apartments
august
a
new
pair
of
trousers
at
and
told
them
not
to
cut
them
so
loose
over
the
boot
the
last
pair
being
so
loose
and
also
tight
at
the
knee
looked
like
a
and
i
heard
pitt
that
objectionable
youth
at
the
office
call
out
as
i
passed
his
desk
carrie
has
ordered
of
miss
jibbons
a
pink
garibaldi
and
skirt
which
i
always
think
looks
so
pretty
at
the
seaside
in
the
evening
she
trimmed
herself
a
little
while
i
read
to
her
the
and
we
had
a
good
laugh
over
my
trying
on
the
hat
when
she
had
finished
it
carrie
saying
it
looked
so
funny
with
my
beard
and
how
the
people
would
have
roared
if
i
went
on
the
stage
like
it
august
beck
wrote
to
say
we
could
have
our
usual
rooms
at
broadstairs
off
our
mind
bought
a
coloured
shirt
and
a
pair
of
boots
which
i
see
many
of
the
swell
clerks
wearing
in
the
city
and
hear
are
all
the
august
beautiful
day
looking
forward
to
carrie
bought
a
parasol
about
five
feet
long
i
told
her
it
was
ridiculous
she
said
james
of
sutton
has
one
twice
as
long
so
the
matter
dropped
i
bought
a
capital
hat
for
hot
weather
at
the
seaside
i
know
what
it
is
called
but
it
is
the
shape
of
the
helmet
worn
in
india
only
made
of
straw
got
three
new
ties
two
coloured
handkerchiefs
and
a
pair
of
socks
at
pope
brothers
spent
the
evening
packing
carrie
told
me
not
to
forget
to
borrow
telescope
which
he
always
lends
me
knowing
i
know
how
to
take
care
of
it
sent
sarah
out
for
it
while
everything
was
seeming
so
bright
the
last
post
brought
us
a
letter
from
beck
saying
have
just
let
all
my
house
to
one
party
and
am
sorry
i
must
take
back
my
words
and
am
sorry
you
must
find
other
apartments
but
womming
next
door
will
be
pleased
to
accommodate
you
but
she
can
not
take
you
before
monday
as
her
rooms
are
engaged
bank
holiday
chapter
vi
the
unexpected
arrival
home
of
our
son
willie
lupin
pooter
august
first
post
brought
a
nice
letter
from
our
dear
son
willie
acknowledging
a
trifling
present
which
carrie
sent
him
the
day
before
yesterday
being
his
twentieth
birthday
to
our
utter
amazement
he
turned
up
himself
in
the
afternoon
having
journeyed
all
the
way
from
oldham
he
said
he
had
got
leave
from
the
bank
and
as
monday
was
a
holiday
he
thought
he
would
give
us
a
little
surprise
august
have
not
seen
willie
since
last
christmas
and
are
pleased
to
notice
what
a
fine
young
man
he
has
grown
one
would
scarcely
believe
he
was
son
he
looks
more
like
a
younger
brother
i
rather
disapprove
of
his
wearing
a
check
suit
on
a
sunday
and
i
think
he
ought
to
have
gone
to
church
this
morning
but
he
said
he
was
tired
after
journey
so
i
refrained
from
any
remark
on
the
subject
we
had
a
bottle
of
port
for
dinner
and
drank
dear
health
he
said
did
i
tell
you
cut
my
first
name
and
taken
the
second
name
in
fact
only
known
at
oldham
as
if
you
were
to
me
there
they
know
what
you
of
course
lupin
being
a
purely
family
name
carrie
was
delighted
and
began
by
giving
a
long
history
of
the
lupins
i
ventured
to
say
that
i
thought
william
a
nice
simple
name
and
reminded
him
he
was
christened
after
his
uncle
william
who
was
much
respected
in
the
city
willie
in
a
manner
which
i
did
not
much
care
for
said
sneeringly
i
know
all
about
old
bill
and
helped
himself
to
a
third
glass
of
port
carrie
objected
strongly
to
my
saying
old
but
she
made
no
remark
when
willie
used
the
double
adjective
i
said
nothing
but
looked
at
her
which
meant
more
i
said
dear
willie
i
hope
you
are
happy
with
your
colleagues
at
the
he
replied
if
you
please
and
with
respect
to
the
bank
not
a
clerk
who
is
a
gentleman
and
the
is
a
i
felt
so
shocked
i
could
say
nothing
and
my
instinct
told
me
there
was
something
wrong
august
bank
there
was
no
sign
of
lupin
moving
at
nine
i
knocked
at
his
door
and
said
we
usually
breakfasted
at
eight
and
asked
how
long
would
he
be
lupin
replied
that
he
had
had
a
lively
time
of
it
first
with
the
train
shaking
the
house
all
night
and
then
with
the
sun
streaming
in
through
the
window
in
his
eyes
and
giving
him
a
cracking
headache
carrie
came
up
and
asked
if
he
would
like
some
breakfast
sent
up
and
he
said
he
could
do
with
a
cup
of
tea
and
want
anything
to
eat
lupin
not
having
come
down
i
went
up
again
at
one
and
said
we
dined
at
two
he
said
he
be
he
never
came
down
till
a
quarter
to
three
i
said
have
not
seen
much
of
you
and
you
will
have
to
return
by
the
train
therefore
you
will
have
to
leave
in
an
hour
unless
you
go
by
the
midnight
he
said
here
no
use
beating
about
the
bush
tendered
my
resignation
at
the
for
a
moment
i
could
not
speak
when
my
speech
came
again
i
said
dare
you
sir
how
dare
you
take
such
a
serious
step
without
consulting
me
answer
me
sir
will
sit
down
immediately
and
write
a
note
at
my
dictation
withdrawing
your
resignation
and
amply
apologising
for
your
imagine
my
dismay
when
he
replied
with
a
loud
guffaw
no
use
if
you
want
the
good
old
truth
got
the
chuck
august
perkupp
has
given
me
leave
to
postpone
my
holiday
a
week
as
we
could
not
get
the
room
this
will
give
us
an
opportunity
of
trying
to
find
an
appointment
for
willie
before
we
go
the
ambition
of
my
life
would
be
to
get
him
into
firm
august
it
is
a
serious
matter
having
our
boy
lupin
on
our
hands
still
it
is
satisfactory
to
know
he
was
asked
to
resign
from
the
bank
simply
because
took
no
interest
in
his
work
and
always
arrived
an
hour
sometimes
two
hours
we
can
all
start
off
on
monday
to
broadstairs
with
a
light
heart
this
will
take
my
mind
off
the
worry
of
the
last
few
days
which
have
been
wasted
over
a
useless
correspondence
with
the
manager
of
the
bank
at
oldham
august
at
broadstairs
very
nice
apartments
near
the
station
on
the
cliffs
they
would
have
been
double
the
price
the
landlady
had
a
nice
five
dinner
and
tea
ready
which
we
all
enjoyed
though
lupin
seemed
fastidious
because
there
happened
to
be
a
fly
in
the
butter
it
was
very
wet
in
the
evening
for
which
i
was
thankful
as
it
was
a
good
excuse
for
going
to
bed
early
lupin
said
he
would
sit
up
and
read
a
bit
august
was
a
little
annoyed
to
find
lupin
instead
of
reading
last
night
had
gone
to
a
common
sort
of
entertainment
given
at
the
assembly
rooms
i
expressed
my
opinion
that
such
performances
were
unworthy
of
respectable
patronage
but
he
replied
it
was
only
one
night
i
had
a
fit
of
the
blues
come
on
and
thought
i
would
go
to
see
polly
presswell
particular
i
told
him
i
was
proud
to
say
i
had
never
heard
of
her
carrie
said
let
the
boy
alone
quite
old
enough
to
take
care
of
himself
and
forget
a
gentleman
remember
you
were
young
once
rained
all
day
hard
but
lupin
would
go
out
august
up
a
bit
so
we
all
took
the
train
to
margate
and
the
first
person
we
met
on
the
jetty
was
gowing
i
said
i
thought
you
had
gone
to
barmouth
with
your
birmingham
friends
he
said
but
young
peter
lawrence
was
so
ill
they
postponed
their
visit
so
i
came
down
here
you
know
the
are
here
too
carrie
said
that
will
be
delightful
we
must
have
some
evenings
together
and
have
i
introduced
lupin
saying
will
be
pleased
to
find
we
have
our
dear
boy
at
home
gowing
said
that
you
mean
to
say
left
the
bank
i
changed
the
subject
quickly
and
thereby
avoided
any
of
those
awkward
questions
which
gowing
always
has
a
knack
of
asking
august
positively
refused
to
walk
down
the
parade
with
me
because
i
was
wearing
my
new
straw
helmet
with
my
i
know
what
the
boy
is
coming
to
august
not
falling
in
with
our
views
carrie
and
i
went
for
a
sail
it
was
a
relief
to
be
with
her
alone
for
when
lupin
irritates
me
she
always
sides
with
him
on
our
return
he
said
been
on
the
emetic
have
you
come
to
on
the
i
presume
he
meant
a
tricycle
but
i
affected
not
to
understand
him
august
and
cummings
walked
over
to
arrange
an
evening
at
margate
it
being
wet
gowing
asked
cummings
to
accompany
him
to
the
hotel
and
have
a
game
of
billiards
knowing
i
never
play
and
in
fact
disapprove
of
the
game
cummings
said
he
must
hasten
back
to
margate
whereupon
lupin
to
my
horror
said
give
you
a
game
hundred
up
a
walk
round
the
cloth
will
give
me
an
appetite
for
i
said
mister
gowing
does
not
care
to
play
with
gowing
surprised
me
by
saying
yes
i
do
if
they
play
well
and
they
walked
off
together
august
was
about
to
read
lupin
a
sermon
on
smoking
which
he
indulges
in
violently
and
billiards
but
he
put
on
his
hat
and
walked
out
carrie
then
read
a
long
sermon
on
the
palpable
inadvisability
of
treating
lupin
as
if
he
were
a
mere
child
i
felt
she
was
somewhat
right
so
in
the
evening
i
offered
him
a
cigar
he
seemed
pleased
but
after
a
few
whiffs
said
is
a
good
old
one
of
mine
and
he
handed
me
a
cigar
as
long
as
it
was
strong
which
is
saying
a
good
deal
august
am
glad
our
last
day
at
the
seaside
was
fine
though
clouded
overhead
we
went
over
to
at
margate
in
the
evening
and
as
it
was
cold
we
stayed
in
and
played
games
gowing
as
usual
overstepping
the
mark
he
suggested
we
should
play
a
game
we
never
heard
of
he
sat
on
a
chair
and
asked
carrie
to
sit
on
his
lap
an
invitation
which
dear
carrie
rightly
declined
after
some
species
of
wrangling
i
sat
on
knees
and
carrie
sat
on
the
edge
of
mine
lupin
sat
on
the
edge
of
lap
then
cummings
on
and
cummings
on
her
we
looked
very
ridiculous
and
laughed
a
good
deal
gowing
then
said
you
a
believer
in
the
great
mogul
we
had
to
answer
all
together
yes
three
times
gowing
said
am
i
and
suddenly
got
up
the
result
of
this
stupid
joke
was
that
we
all
fell
on
the
ground
and
poor
carrie
banged
her
head
against
the
corner
of
the
fender
cummings
put
some
vinegar
on
but
through
this
we
missed
the
last
train
and
had
to
drive
back
to
broadstairs
which
cost
me
chapter
vii
home
again
influence
on
carrie
can
get
nothing
for
lupin
neighbours
are
a
little
troublesome
some
one
tampers
with
my
diary
got
a
place
for
lupin
lupin
startles
us
with
an
announcement
august
sweet
home
again
carrie
bought
some
pretty
mats
to
stand
vases
on
fripps
janus
and
write
to
say
they
are
sorry
they
have
no
vacancy
among
their
staff
of
clerks
for
lupin
august
bought
a
pair
of
heads
made
of
and
coloured
brown
they
will
look
just
the
thing
for
our
little
hall
and
give
it
style
the
heads
are
excellent
imitations
poolers
and
smith
are
sorry
they
have
nothing
to
offer
lupin
august
to
please
lupin
and
make
things
cheerful
for
him
as
he
is
a
little
down
carrie
invited
james
to
come
up
from
sutton
and
spend
two
or
three
days
with
us
we
have
not
said
a
word
to
lupin
but
mean
to
keep
it
as
a
surprise
august
james
of
sutton
arrived
in
the
afternoon
bringing
with
her
an
enormous
bunch
of
wild
flowers
the
more
i
see
of
james
the
nicer
i
think
she
is
and
she
is
devoted
to
carrie
she
went
into
room
to
take
off
her
bonnet
and
remained
there
nearly
an
hour
talking
about
dress
lupin
said
he
was
not
a
bit
surprised
at
but
was
surprised
at
august
late
for
church
james
having
talked
considerably
about
what
to
wear
all
the
morning
lupin
does
not
seem
to
get
on
very
well
with
james
i
am
afraid
we
shall
have
some
trouble
with
our
neighbours
who
came
in
last
wednesday
several
of
their
friends
who
drive
up
in
have
already
made
themselves
objectionable
an
evening
or
two
ago
i
had
put
on
a
white
waistcoat
for
coolness
and
while
walking
past
with
my
thumbs
in
my
waistcoat
pockets
a
habit
i
have
one
man
seated
in
the
cart
and
looking
like
an
american
commenced
singing
some
vulgar
nonsense
about
had
thirteen
dollars
in
my
waistcoat
i
fancied
it
was
meant
for
me
and
my
suspicions
were
confirmed
for
while
walking
round
the
garden
in
my
tall
hat
this
afternoon
a
cracker
was
deliberately
aimed
at
my
hat
and
exploded
on
it
like
a
percussion
cap
i
turned
sharply
and
am
positive
i
saw
the
man
who
was
in
the
cart
retreating
from
one
of
the
bedroom
windows
august
and
james
went
off
shopping
and
had
not
returned
when
i
came
back
from
the
office
judging
from
the
subsequent
conversation
i
am
afraid
james
is
filling
head
with
a
lot
of
nonsense
about
dress
i
walked
over
to
and
asked
him
to
drop
in
to
supper
and
make
things
pleasant
carrie
prepared
a
little
extemporised
supper
consisting
of
the
remainder
of
the
cold
joint
a
small
piece
of
salmon
which
i
was
to
refuse
in
case
there
was
not
enough
to
go
round
and
a
and
custards
there
was
also
a
decanter
of
port
and
some
jam
puffs
on
the
sideboard
james
made
us
play
rather
a
good
game
of
cards
called
to
my
surprise
in
fact
disgust
lupin
got
up
in
the
middle
and
in
a
most
sarcastic
tone
said
me
this
sort
of
thing
is
too
fast
for
me
i
shall
go
and
enjoy
a
quiet
game
of
marbles
in
the
things
might
have
become
rather
disagreeable
but
for
gowing
who
seems
to
have
taken
to
lupin
suggesting
they
should
invent
games
lupin
said
play
he
then
led
gowing
all
round
the
room
and
brought
him
in
front
of
the
i
must
confess
i
laughed
heartily
at
this
i
was
a
little
vexed
at
everybody
subsequently
laughing
at
some
joke
which
they
did
not
explain
and
it
was
only
on
going
to
bed
i
discovered
i
must
have
been
walking
about
all
the
evening
with
an
antimacassar
on
one
button
of
my
august
a
large
brick
in
the
middle
bed
of
geraniums
evidently
come
from
next
door
pattles
and
pattles
find
a
place
for
lupin
august
james
is
making
a
positive
fool
of
carrie
carrie
appeared
in
a
new
dress
like
a
she
said
was
all
the
rage
i
replied
it
put
me
in
a
rage
she
also
had
on
a
hat
as
big
as
a
kitchen
and
the
same
shape
james
went
home
and
both
lupin
and
i
were
somewhat
first
time
we
have
agreed
on
a
single
subject
since
his
return
merkins
and
son
write
they
have
no
vacancy
for
lupin
october
should
very
much
like
to
know
who
has
wilfully
torn
the
last
five
or
six
weeks
out
of
my
diary
it
is
perfectly
monstrous
mine
is
a
large
scribbling
diary
with
plenty
of
space
for
the
record
of
my
everyday
events
and
in
keeping
up
that
record
i
take
with
much
pride
a
great
deal
of
pains
i
asked
carrie
if
she
knew
anything
about
it
she
replied
it
was
my
own
fault
for
leaving
the
diary
about
with
a
charwoman
cleaning
and
the
sweeps
in
the
house
i
said
that
was
not
an
answer
to
my
question
this
retort
of
mine
which
i
thought
extremely
smart
would
have
been
more
effective
had
i
not
jogged
my
elbow
against
a
vase
on
a
table
temporarily
placed
in
the
passage
knocked
it
over
and
smashed
it
carrie
was
dreadfully
upset
at
this
disaster
for
it
was
one
of
a
pair
of
vases
which
can
not
be
matched
given
to
us
on
our
by
burtsett
an
old
friend
of
cousins
the
pommertons
late
of
dalston
i
called
to
sarah
and
asked
her
about
the
diary
she
said
she
had
not
been
in
the
at
all
after
the
sweep
had
left
birrell
the
charwoman
had
cleaned
the
room
and
lighted
the
fire
herself
finding
a
burnt
piece
of
paper
in
the
grate
i
examined
it
and
found
it
was
a
piece
of
my
diary
so
it
was
evident
some
one
had
torn
my
diary
to
light
the
fire
i
requested
birrell
to
be
sent
to
me
october
a
letter
from
our
principal
perkupp
saying
that
he
thinks
he
knows
of
a
place
at
last
for
our
dear
boy
lupin
this
in
a
measure
consoles
me
for
the
loss
of
a
portion
of
my
diary
for
i
am
bound
to
confess
the
last
few
weeks
have
been
devoted
to
the
record
of
disappointing
answers
received
from
people
to
whom
i
have
applied
for
appointments
for
lupin
birrell
called
and
in
reply
to
me
said
never
no
book
much
less
take
such
a
liberty
as
i
said
i
was
determined
to
find
out
who
did
it
whereupon
she
said
she
would
do
her
best
to
help
me
but
she
remembered
the
sweep
lighting
the
fire
with
a
bit
of
the
i
requested
the
sweep
to
be
sent
to
me
i
wish
carrie
had
not
given
lupin
a
we
never
seem
to
see
anything
of
him
i
sat
up
till
past
one
for
him
and
then
retired
tired
november
entry
yesterday
about
tired
which
i
did
not
notice
at
the
time
is
rather
funny
if
i
were
not
so
worried
just
now
i
might
have
had
a
little
joke
about
it
the
sweep
called
but
had
the
audacity
to
come
up
to
the
and
lean
his
dirty
bag
of
soot
on
the
he
however
was
so
polite
i
could
not
rebuke
him
he
said
sarah
lighted
the
fire
unfortunately
sarah
heard
this
for
she
was
dusting
the
banisters
and
she
ran
down
and
flew
into
a
temper
with
the
sweep
causing
a
row
on
the
front
which
i
would
not
have
had
happen
for
anything
i
ordered
her
about
her
business
and
told
the
sweep
i
was
sorry
to
have
troubled
him
and
so
i
was
for
the
were
covered
with
soot
in
consequence
of
his
visit
i
would
willingly
give
ten
shillings
to
find
out
who
tore
my
diary
november
spent
the
evening
quietly
with
carrie
of
whose
company
i
never
tire
we
had
a
most
pleasant
chat
about
the
letters
on
marriage
a
failure
it
has
been
no
failure
in
our
case
in
talking
over
our
own
happy
experiences
we
never
noticed
that
it
was
past
midnight
we
were
startled
by
hearing
the
door
slam
violently
lupin
had
come
in
he
made
no
attempt
to
turn
down
the
gas
in
the
passage
or
even
to
look
into
the
room
where
we
were
but
went
straight
up
to
bed
making
a
terrible
noise
i
asked
him
to
come
down
for
a
moment
and
he
begged
to
be
excused
as
he
was
beat
an
observation
that
was
scarcely
consistent
with
the
fact
that
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
he
was
positively
dancing
in
his
room
and
shouting
out
me
dance
the
polka
or
some
such
nonsense
november
news
at
last
perkupp
has
got
an
appointment
for
lupin
and
he
is
to
go
and
see
about
it
on
monday
oh
how
my
mind
is
relieved
i
went
to
room
to
take
the
good
news
to
him
but
he
was
in
bed
very
seedy
so
i
resolved
to
keep
it
over
till
the
evening
he
said
he
had
last
night
been
elected
a
member
of
an
amateur
dramatic
club
called
the
and
though
it
was
a
pleasant
evening
he
had
sat
in
a
draught
and
got
neuralgia
in
the
head
he
declined
to
have
any
breakfast
so
i
left
him
in
the
evening
i
had
up
a
special
bottle
of
port
and
lupin
being
in
for
a
wonder
we
filled
our
glasses
and
i
said
my
boy
i
have
some
good
and
unexpected
news
for
you
perkupp
has
procured
you
an
appointment
lupin
said
biz
and
we
drained
our
glasses
lupin
then
said
up
the
glasses
again
for
i
have
some
good
and
unexpected
news
for
i
had
some
slight
misgivings
and
so
evidently
had
carrie
for
she
said
hope
we
shall
think
it
good
lupin
said
all
right
engaged
to
be
chapter
viii
daisy
mutlar
sole
topic
of
conversation
new
berth
fireworks
at
the
the
sarah
quarrels
with
the
charwoman
interference
am
introduced
to
daisy
mutlar
we
decide
to
give
a
party
in
her
honour
november
and
i
troubled
about
that
mere
boy
lupin
getting
engaged
to
be
married
without
consulting
us
or
anything
after
dinner
he
told
us
all
about
it
he
said
the
name
was
daisy
mutlar
and
she
was
the
nicest
prettiest
and
most
accomplished
girl
he
ever
met
he
loved
her
the
moment
he
saw
her
and
if
he
had
to
wait
fifty
years
he
would
wait
and
he
knew
she
would
wait
for
him
lupin
further
said
with
much
warmth
that
the
world
was
a
different
world
to
him
now
was
a
world
worth
living
in
he
lived
with
an
object
now
and
that
was
to
make
daisy
pooter
and
he
would
guarantee
she
would
not
disgrace
the
family
of
the
pooters
carrie
here
burst
out
crying
and
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
in
doing
so
upset
the
glass
of
port
he
held
in
his
hand
all
over
his
new
light
trousers
i
said
i
had
no
doubt
we
should
like
miss
mutlar
when
we
saw
her
but
carrie
said
she
loved
her
already
i
thought
this
rather
premature
but
held
my
tongue
daisy
mutlar
was
the
sole
topic
of
conversation
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
i
asked
lupin
who
her
people
were
and
he
replied
you
know
mutlar
williams
and
i
did
not
know
but
refrained
from
asking
any
further
questions
at
present
for
fear
of
irritating
lupin
november
went
with
me
to
the
office
and
had
a
long
conversation
with
perkupp
our
principal
the
result
of
which
was
that
he
accepted
a
clerkship
in
the
firm
of
job
cleanands
and
stock
and
share
brokers
lupin
told
me
privately
it
was
an
advertising
firm
and
he
did
not
think
much
of
it
i
replied
should
not
be
choosers
and
i
will
do
lupin
the
justice
to
say
he
looked
rather
ashamed
of
himself
in
the
evening
we
went
round
to
the
to
have
a
few
fireworks
it
began
to
rain
and
i
thought
it
rather
dull
one
of
my
squibs
would
not
go
off
and
gowing
said
it
on
your
boot
boy
it
will
go
off
i
gave
it
a
few
knocks
on
the
end
of
my
boot
and
it
went
off
with
one
loud
explosion
and
burnt
my
fingers
rather
badly
i
gave
the
rest
of
the
squibs
to
the
little
boy
to
let
off
another
unfortunate
thing
happened
which
brought
a
heap
of
abuse
on
my
head
cummings
fastened
a
large
wheel
on
a
stake
in
the
ground
by
way
of
a
grand
finale
he
made
a
great
fuss
about
it
said
it
cost
seven
shillings
there
was
a
little
difficulty
in
getting
it
alight
at
last
it
went
off
but
after
a
couple
of
slow
revolutions
it
stopped
i
had
my
stick
with
me
so
i
gave
it
a
tap
to
send
it
round
and
unfortunately
it
fell
off
the
stake
on
to
the
grass
anybody
would
have
thought
i
had
set
the
house
on
fire
from
the
way
in
which
they
stormed
at
me
i
will
never
join
in
any
more
firework
parties
it
is
a
ridiculous
waste
of
time
and
money
november
asked
carrie
to
call
on
mutlar
but
carrie
said
she
thought
mutlar
ought
to
call
on
her
first
i
agreed
with
carrie
and
this
led
to
an
argument
however
the
matter
was
settled
by
carrie
saying
she
could
not
find
any
visiting
cards
and
we
must
get
some
more
printed
and
when
they
were
finished
would
be
quite
time
enough
to
discuss
the
etiquette
of
calling
november
ordered
some
of
our
cards
at
the
stationers
i
ordered
of
each
which
will
last
us
for
a
good
long
time
in
the
evening
lupin
brought
in
harry
mutlar
miss
brother
he
was
rather
a
gawky
youth
and
lupin
said
he
was
the
most
popular
and
best
amateur
in
the
club
referring
to
the
lupin
whispered
to
us
that
if
we
could
only
harry
a
bit
he
would
make
us
roar
with
laughter
at
supper
young
mutlar
did
several
amusing
things
he
took
up
a
knife
and
with
the
flat
part
of
it
played
a
tune
on
his
cheek
in
a
wonderful
manner
he
also
gave
an
imitation
of
an
old
man
with
no
teeth
smoking
a
big
cigar
the
way
he
kept
dropping
the
cigar
sent
carrie
into
fits
in
the
course
of
conversation
name
cropped
up
and
young
mutlar
said
he
would
bring
his
sister
round
to
us
one
parents
being
rather
and
not
going
out
much
carrie
said
we
would
get
up
a
little
special
party
as
young
mutlar
showed
no
inclination
to
go
and
it
was
approaching
eleven
as
a
hint
i
reminded
lupin
that
he
had
to
be
up
early
instead
of
taking
the
hint
mutlar
began
a
series
of
comic
imitations
he
went
on
for
an
hour
without
cessation
poor
carrie
could
scarcely
keep
her
eyes
open
at
last
she
made
an
excuse
and
said
mutlar
then
left
and
i
heard
him
and
lupin
whispering
in
the
hall
something
about
the
comedians
and
to
my
disgust
although
it
was
past
midnight
lupin
put
on
his
hat
and
coat
and
went
out
with
his
new
companion
november
endeavours
to
discover
who
tore
the
sheets
out
of
my
diary
still
fruitless
lupin
has
daisy
mutlar
on
the
brain
so
we
see
little
of
him
except
that
he
invariably
turns
up
at
meal
times
cummings
dropped
in
november
seems
to
like
his
new
a
comfort
daisy
mutlar
the
sole
topic
of
conversation
during
tea
carrie
almost
as
full
of
it
as
lupin
lupin
informs
me
to
my
disgust
that
he
has
been
persuaded
to
take
part
in
the
forthcoming
performance
of
the
he
says
he
is
to
play
bob
britches
in
the
farce
to
my
frank
mutlar
is
going
to
play
old
musty
i
told
lupin
pretty
plainly
i
was
not
in
the
least
degree
interested
in
the
matter
and
totally
disapproved
of
amateur
theatricals
gowing
came
in
the
evening
november
home
to
find
the
house
in
a
most
disgraceful
uproar
carrie
who
appeared
very
frightened
was
standing
outside
her
bedroom
while
sarah
was
excited
and
crying
birrell
the
charwoman
who
had
evidently
been
drinking
was
shouting
at
the
top
of
her
voice
that
she
was
thief
that
she
was
a
respectable
woman
who
had
to
work
hard
for
her
living
and
she
would
smack
face
who
put
lies
into
her
lupin
whose
back
was
towards
me
did
not
hear
me
come
in
he
was
standing
between
the
two
women
and
i
regret
to
say
in
his
endeavour
to
act
as
peacemaker
he
made
use
of
rather
strong
language
in
the
presence
of
his
mother
and
i
was
just
in
time
to
hear
him
say
all
this
fuss
about
the
loss
of
a
few
pages
from
a
rotten
diary
that
fetch
a
pound
i
said
quietly
me
lupin
that
is
a
matter
of
opinion
and
as
i
am
master
of
this
house
perhaps
you
will
allow
me
to
take
the
i
ascertained
that
the
cause
of
the
row
was
that
sarah
had
accused
birrell
of
tearing
the
pages
out
of
my
diary
to
wrap
up
some
kitchen
fat
and
leavings
which
she
had
taken
out
of
the
house
last
week
birrell
had
slapped
face
and
said
she
had
taken
nothing
out
of
the
place
as
there
was
no
leavings
to
i
ordered
sarah
back
to
her
work
and
requested
birrell
to
go
home
when
i
entered
the
parlour
lupin
was
kicking
his
legs
in
the
air
and
roaring
with
laughter
november
home
from
church
carrie
and
i
met
lupin
daisy
mutlar
and
her
brother
daisy
was
introduced
to
us
and
we
walked
home
together
carrie
walking
on
with
miss
mutlar
we
asked
them
in
for
a
few
minutes
and
i
had
a
good
look
at
my
future
my
heart
quite
sank
she
is
a
big
young
woman
and
i
should
think
at
least
eight
years
older
than
lupin
i
did
not
even
think
her
carrie
asked
her
if
she
could
come
in
on
wednesday
next
with
her
brother
to
meet
a
few
friends
she
replied
that
she
would
only
be
too
pleased
november
sent
out
invitations
to
gowing
the
cummings
to
and
james
of
sutton
and
stillbrook
i
wrote
a
note
to
franching
of
peckham
carrie
said
we
may
as
well
make
it
a
nice
affair
and
why
not
ask
our
principal
perkupp
i
said
i
feared
we
were
not
quite
grand
enough
for
him
carrie
said
there
was
offence
in
asking
i
said
not
and
i
wrote
him
a
letter
carrie
confessed
she
was
a
little
disappointed
with
daisy
appearance
but
thought
she
seemed
a
nice
girl
november
so
far
has
accepted
for
our
quite
grand
little
party
for
perkupp
in
a
nice
letter
which
i
shall
keep
wrote
that
he
was
dining
in
kensington
but
if
he
could
get
away
he
would
come
up
to
holloway
for
an
hour
carrie
was
busy
all
day
making
little
cakes
and
open
jam
puffs
and
jellies
she
said
she
felt
quite
nervous
about
her
responsibilities
evening
we
decided
to
have
some
light
things
on
the
table
such
as
sandwiches
cold
chicken
and
ham
and
some
sweets
and
on
the
sideboard
a
nice
piece
of
cold
beef
and
a
paysandu
the
more
hungry
ones
to
peg
into
if
they
liked
gowing
called
to
know
if
he
was
to
put
on
carrie
said
he
had
better
dress
especially
as
franching
was
coming
and
there
was
a
possibility
of
perkupp
also
putting
in
an
appearance
gowing
said
i
only
wanted
to
know
for
i
have
not
worn
my
for
some
time
and
i
must
send
it
to
have
the
creases
pressed
after
gowing
left
lupin
came
in
and
in
his
anxiety
to
please
daisy
mutlar
carped
at
and
criticised
the
arrangements
and
in
fact
disapproved
of
everything
including
our
having
asked
our
old
friend
cummings
who
he
said
would
look
in
like
a
engaged
to
wait
and
who
must
not
be
surprised
if
daisy
took
him
for
one
i
fairly
lost
my
temper
and
said
allow
me
to
tell
you
miss
daisy
mutlar
is
not
the
queen
of
england
i
gave
you
credit
for
more
wisdom
than
to
allow
yourself
to
be
inveigled
into
an
engagement
with
a
woman
considerably
older
than
yourself
i
advise
you
to
think
of
earning
your
living
before
entangling
yourself
with
a
wife
whom
you
will
have
to
support
and
in
all
probability
her
brother
also
who
appeared
to
be
nothing
but
a
instead
of
receiving
this
advice
in
a
sensible
manner
lupin
jumped
up
and
said
you
insult
the
lady
i
am
engaged
to
you
insult
me
i
will
leave
the
house
and
never
darken
your
doors
he
went
out
of
the
house
slamming
the
but
it
was
all
right
he
came
back
to
supper
and
we
played
bézique
till
nearly
twelve
chapter
ix
our
first
important
party
old
friends
and
new
friends
gowing
is
a
little
annoying
but
his
friend
stillbrook
turns
out
to
be
quite
amusing
inopportune
arrival
of
perkupp
but
he
is
most
kind
and
complimentary
party
a
great
success
november
day
our
first
important
party
since
we
have
been
in
this
house
i
got
home
early
from
the
city
lupin
insisted
on
having
a
hired
waiter
and
stood
a
of
champagne
i
think
this
an
unnecessary
expense
but
lupin
said
he
had
had
a
piece
of
luck
having
made
three
pounds
out
a
private
deal
in
the
city
i
hope
he
gamble
in
his
new
situation
the
looked
so
nice
and
carrie
truly
said
need
not
be
ashamed
of
its
being
seen
by
perkupp
should
he
honour
us
by
i
dressed
early
in
case
people
should
arrive
punctually
at
eight
and
was
much
vexed
to
find
my
new
much
too
short
lupin
who
is
getting
beyond
his
position
found
fault
with
my
wearing
ordinary
boots
instead
of
i
replied
satirically
dear
son
i
have
lived
to
be
above
that
sort
of
lupin
burst
out
laughing
and
said
man
generally
was
above
his
this
may
be
funny
or
it
may
but
i
was
gratified
to
find
he
had
not
discovered
the
coral
had
come
off
one
of
my
studs
carrie
looked
a
picture
wearing
the
dress
she
wore
at
the
mansion
house
the
arrangement
of
the
was
excellent
carrie
had
hung
muslin
curtains
over
the
and
also
over
one
of
the
entrances
for
we
had
removed
the
door
from
its
hinges
peters
the
waiter
arrived
in
good
time
and
i
gave
him
strict
orders
not
to
open
another
bottle
of
champagne
until
the
previous
one
was
empty
carrie
arranged
for
some
sherry
and
port
wine
to
be
placed
on
the
sideboard
with
some
glasses
our
new
enlarged
and
tinted
photographs
look
very
nice
on
the
walls
especially
as
carrie
has
arranged
some
liberty
silk
bows
on
the
four
corners
of
them
the
first
arrival
was
gowing
who
with
his
usual
taste
greeted
me
with
pooter
why
your
trousers
are
too
short
i
simply
said
likely
and
you
will
find
my
temper
he
said
make
your
trousers
longer
juggins
you
should
get
your
missus
to
put
a
flounce
on
i
wonder
i
waste
my
time
entering
his
insulting
observations
in
my
diary
the
next
arrivals
were
and
cummings
the
former
said
you
say
anything
about
dress
i
have
come
he
had
on
a
black
and
white
tie
the
merton
and
stillbrook
arrived
but
lupin
was
restless
and
unbearable
till
his
daisy
mutlar
and
frank
arrived
carrie
and
i
were
rather
startled
at
appearance
she
had
a
dress
on
cut
very
low
in
the
neck
i
do
not
think
such
a
style
modest
she
ought
to
have
taken
a
lesson
from
carrie
and
covered
her
shoulders
with
a
little
lace
nackles
and
his
four
daughters
came
so
did
franching
and
one
or
two
of
new
friends
members
of
the
some
of
these
seemed
rather
theatrical
in
their
manner
especially
one
who
was
posing
all
the
evening
and
leant
on
our
little
round
table
and
cracked
it
lupin
called
him
henry
and
said
he
was
lead
at
the
and
was
quite
as
good
in
that
department
as
harry
mutlar
was
as
the
merchant
all
this
is
greek
to
me
we
had
some
music
and
lupin
who
never
left
side
for
a
moment
raved
over
her
singing
of
a
song
called
it
seemed
a
pretty
song
but
she
made
such
grimaces
and
sang
to
my
mind
so
out
of
tune
i
would
not
have
asked
her
to
sing
again
but
lupin
made
her
sing
four
songs
right
off
one
after
the
other
at
ten
we
went
down
to
supper
and
from
the
way
gowing
and
cummings
ate
you
would
have
thought
they
had
not
had
a
meal
for
a
month
i
told
carrie
to
keep
something
back
in
case
perkupp
should
come
by
mere
chance
gowing
annoyed
me
very
much
by
filling
a
large
tumbler
of
champagne
and
drinking
it
straight
off
he
repeated
this
action
and
made
me
fear
our
of
champagne
would
not
last
out
i
tried
to
keep
a
bottle
back
but
lupin
got
hold
of
it
and
took
it
to
the
with
daisy
and
frank
mutlar
we
went
upstairs
and
the
young
fellows
began
skylarking
carrie
put
a
stop
to
that
at
once
stillbrook
amused
us
with
a
song
have
you
done
with
your
cousin
john
i
did
not
notice
that
lupin
and
frank
had
disappeared
i
asked
watson
one
of
the
holloways
where
they
were
and
he
said
a
case
of
what
a
surprise
we
were
directed
to
form
a
we
did
watson
then
said
have
much
pleasure
in
introducing
the
celebrated
blondin
frank
and
lupin
then
bounded
into
the
room
lupin
had
whitened
his
face
like
a
clown
and
frank
had
tied
round
his
waist
a
large
hearthrug
he
was
supposed
to
be
the
donkey
and
he
looked
it
they
indulged
in
a
very
noisy
pantomime
and
we
were
all
shrieking
with
laughter
i
turned
round
suddenly
and
then
i
saw
perkupp
standing
in
the
door
he
having
arrived
without
our
knowing
it
i
beckoned
to
carrie
and
we
went
up
to
him
at
once
he
would
not
come
right
into
the
room
i
apologised
for
the
foolery
but
perkupp
said
it
seems
i
could
see
he
was
not
a
bit
amused
carrie
and
i
took
him
downstairs
but
the
table
was
a
wreck
there
was
not
a
glass
of
champagne
even
a
sandwich
perkupp
said
he
required
nothing
but
would
like
a
glass
of
seltzer
or
soda
water
the
last
syphon
was
empty
carrie
said
have
plenty
of
port
wine
perkupp
said
with
a
smile
thank
you
i
really
require
nothing
but
i
am
most
pleased
to
see
you
and
your
husband
in
your
own
home
will
excuse
my
very
short
stay
i
i
went
with
him
to
his
carriage
and
he
said
trouble
to
come
to
the
office
till
twelve
i
felt
despondent
as
i
went
back
to
the
house
and
i
told
carrie
i
thought
the
party
was
a
failure
carrie
said
it
was
a
great
success
and
i
was
only
tired
and
insisted
on
my
having
some
port
myself
i
drank
two
glasses
and
felt
much
better
and
we
went
into
the
where
they
had
commenced
dancing
carrie
and
i
had
a
little
dance
which
i
said
reminded
me
of
old
days
she
said
i
was
a
spooney
old
thing
chapter
x
reflections
i
make
another
good
joke
am
annoyed
at
the
constant
of
the
lupin
expresses
his
opinion
of
weddings
lupin
falls
out
with
daisy
mutlar
november
about
twenty
times
during
the
night
with
terrible
thirst
finished
off
all
the
water
in
the
bottle
as
well
as
half
that
in
the
jug
kept
dreaming
also
that
last
party
was
a
failure
and
that
a
lot
of
low
people
came
without
invitation
and
kept
chaffing
and
throwing
things
at
perkupp
till
at
last
i
was
obliged
to
hide
him
in
the
which
we
had
just
discovered
with
a
over
him
it
seems
absurd
now
but
it
was
painfully
real
in
the
dream
i
had
the
same
dream
about
a
dozen
times
carrie
annoyed
me
by
saying
know
champagne
never
agrees
with
i
told
her
i
had
only
a
couple
of
glasses
of
it
having
kept
myself
entirely
to
port
i
added
that
good
champagne
hurt
nobody
and
lupin
told
me
he
had
only
got
it
from
a
traveller
as
a
favour
as
that
particular
brand
had
been
entirely
bought
up
by
a
club
i
think
i
ate
too
heartily
of
the
dishes
as
the
waiter
called
them
i
said
to
carrie
wish
i
had
put
those
i
repeated
this
but
carrie
was
busy
packing
up
the
teaspoons
we
had
borrowed
of
cummings
for
the
party
it
was
just
eleven
and
i
was
starting
for
the
office
when
lupin
appeared
with
a
yellow
complexion
and
said
what
priced
head
have
you
this
morning
i
told
him
he
might
just
as
well
speak
to
me
in
dutch
he
added
i
woke
this
morning
my
head
was
as
big
as
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
i
said
the
cleverest
thing
i
think
i
have
ever
said
viz
that
accounts
for
the
we
roared
november
feel
tired
and
headachy
in
the
evening
gowing
called
and
was
full
of
praise
about
our
party
last
wednesday
he
said
everything
was
done
beautifully
and
he
enjoyed
himself
enormously
gowing
can
be
a
very
nice
fellow
when
he
likes
but
you
never
know
how
long
it
will
last
for
instance
he
stopped
to
supper
and
seeing
some
on
the
table
shouted
out
while
the
servant
was
in
the
room
the
remains
of
wednesday
november
up
quite
fresh
after
a
good
rest
and
feel
quite
myself
again
i
am
satisfied
a
life
of
and
society
is
not
a
life
for
me
we
therefore
declined
the
invitation
which
we
received
this
morning
to
miss
wedding
we
only
met
her
twice
at
and
it
means
a
present
lupin
said
am
with
you
for
once
to
my
mind
a
a
very
poor
play
there
are
only
two
parts
in
bride
and
bridegroom
the
best
man
is
only
a
walking
gentleman
with
the
exception
of
a
crying
father
and
a
snivelling
mother
the
rest
are
who
have
to
dress
well
and
have
to
for
their
insignificant
parts
in
the
shape
of
costly
i
did
not
care
for
the
theatrical
slang
but
thought
it
clever
though
disrespectful
i
told
sarah
not
to
bring
up
the
again
for
breakfast
it
seems
to
have
been
placed
on
our
table
at
every
meal
since
wednesday
cummings
came
round
in
the
evening
and
congratulated
us
on
the
success
of
our
party
he
said
it
was
the
best
party
he
had
been
to
for
many
a
year
but
he
wished
we
had
let
him
know
it
was
full
dress
as
he
would
have
turned
up
in
his
we
sat
down
to
a
quiet
game
of
dominoes
and
were
interrupted
by
the
noisy
entrance
of
lupin
and
frank
mutlar
cummings
and
i
asked
them
to
join
us
lupin
said
he
did
not
care
for
dominoes
and
suggested
a
game
of
on
my
asking
if
it
required
counters
frank
and
lupin
in
measured
time
said
two
three
go
have
you
an
estate
in
greenland
it
was
simply
greek
to
me
but
it
appears
it
is
one
of
the
customs
of
the
to
do
this
when
a
member
displays
ignorance
in
spite
of
my
instructions
that
was
brought
up
again
for
supper
to
make
matters
worse
there
had
been
an
attempt
to
disguise
it
by
placing
it
in
a
glass
dish
with
jam
round
it
carrie
asked
lupin
if
he
would
have
some
and
he
replied
goods
for
me
thank
i
told
carrie
when
we
were
alone
if
that
were
placed
on
the
table
again
i
should
walk
out
of
the
house
november
delightfully
quiet
day
in
the
afternoon
lupin
was
off
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
with
the
mutlars
he
departed
in
the
best
of
spirits
and
carrie
said
one
advantage
of
engagement
with
daisy
is
that
the
boy
seems
happy
all
day
long
that
quite
reconciles
me
to
what
i
must
confess
seems
an
imprudent
carrie
and
i
talked
the
matter
over
during
the
evening
and
agreed
that
it
did
not
always
follow
that
an
early
engagement
meant
an
unhappy
marriage
dear
carrie
reminded
me
that
we
married
early
and
with
the
exception
of
a
few
trivial
misunderstandings
we
had
never
had
a
really
serious
word
i
could
not
help
thinking
as
i
told
her
that
half
the
pleasures
of
life
were
derived
from
the
little
struggles
and
small
privations
that
one
had
to
endure
at
the
beginning
of
married
life
such
struggles
were
generally
occasioned
by
want
of
means
and
often
helped
to
make
loving
couples
stand
together
all
the
firmer
carrie
said
i
had
expressed
myself
wonderfully
well
and
that
i
was
quite
a
philosopher
we
are
all
vain
at
times
and
i
must
confess
i
felt
flattered
by
little
compliment
i
pretend
to
be
able
to
express
myself
in
fine
language
but
i
feel
i
have
the
power
of
expressing
my
thoughts
with
simplicity
and
lucidness
about
nine
to
our
surprise
lupin
entered
with
a
wild
reckless
look
and
in
a
hollow
voice
which
i
must
say
seemed
rather
theatrical
said
you
any
brandy
i
said
but
here
is
some
lupin
drank
off
nearly
a
wineglassful
without
water
to
my
horror
we
all
three
sat
reading
in
silence
till
ten
when
carrie
and
i
rose
to
go
to
bed
carrie
said
to
lupin
hope
daisy
is
well
lupin
with
a
forced
careless
air
that
he
must
have
picked
up
from
the
comedians
replied
daisy
you
mean
miss
mutlar
i
know
whether
she
is
well
or
not
but
please
to
mention
her
name
again
in
my
chapter
xi
we
have
a
dose
of
irving
imitations
make
the
acquaintance
of
a
padge
care
for
him
becomes
a
nuisance
november
seen
nothing
of
lupin
the
whole
day
bought
a
cheap
i
spent
the
evening
copying
in
the
names
and
addresses
of
my
friends
and
acquaintances
left
out
the
mutlars
of
course
november
turned
up
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
evening
he
asked
for
a
drop
of
brandy
with
a
sort
of
careless
look
which
to
my
mind
was
theatrical
and
quite
ineffective
i
said
boy
i
have
none
and
i
think
i
should
give
it
you
if
i
lupin
said
go
where
i
can
get
some
and
walked
out
of
the
house
carrie
took
the
part
and
the
rest
of
the
evening
was
spent
in
a
disagreeable
discussion
in
which
the
words
and
must
have
occurred
a
thousand
times
november
and
cummings
dropped
in
during
the
evening
lupin
also
came
in
bringing
his
friend
of
the
was
at
our
party
the
other
night
and
who
cracked
our
little
round
table
happy
to
say
daisy
mutlar
was
never
referred
to
the
conversation
was
almost
entirely
monopolised
by
the
young
fellow
fosselton
who
not
only
looked
rather
like
irving
but
seemed
to
imagine
that
he
the
celebrated
actor
i
must
say
he
gave
some
capital
imitations
of
him
as
he
showed
no
signs
of
moving
at
supper
time
i
said
you
like
to
stay
fosselton
for
our
usual
he
replied
thanks
but
please
call
me
it
is
a
double
name
there
are
lots
of
fosseltons
but
please
call
me
he
began
doing
the
irving
business
all
through
supper
he
sank
so
low
down
in
his
chair
that
his
chin
was
almost
on
a
level
with
the
table
and
twice
he
kicked
carrie
under
the
table
upset
his
wine
and
flashed
a
knife
uncomfortably
near
face
after
supper
he
kept
stretching
out
his
legs
on
the
fender
indulging
in
scraps
of
quotations
from
plays
which
were
greek
to
me
and
more
than
once
knocked
over
the
making
a
hideous
carrie
already
having
a
bad
headache
when
he
went
he
said
to
our
surprise
will
come
and
bring
my
irving
gowing
and
cummings
said
they
would
like
to
see
it
and
would
come
too
i
could
not
help
thinking
they
might
as
well
give
a
party
at
my
house
while
they
are
about
it
however
as
carrie
sensibly
said
anything
dear
to
make
lupin
forget
the
daisy
mutlar
november
the
evening
cummings
came
early
gowing
came
a
little
later
and
brought
without
asking
permission
a
fat
and
i
think
very
man
named
padge
who
appeared
to
be
all
moustache
gowing
never
attempted
any
apology
to
either
of
us
but
said
padge
wanted
to
see
the
irving
business
to
which
padge
said
right
and
that
is
about
all
he
say
during
the
entire
evening
lupin
came
in
and
seemed
in
much
better
spirits
he
had
prepared
a
bit
of
a
surprise
had
come
in
with
him
but
had
gone
upstairs
to
get
ready
in
lupin
retired
from
the
parlour
and
returning
in
a
few
minutes
announced
henry
i
must
say
we
were
all
astounded
i
never
saw
such
a
resemblance
it
was
astonishing
the
only
person
who
did
not
appear
interested
was
the
man
padge
who
had
got
the
best
and
was
puffing
away
at
a
foul
pipe
into
the
fireplace
after
some
little
time
i
said
do
actors
always
wear
their
hair
so
long
carrie
in
a
moment
said
hare
wear
long
how
we
laughed
except
fosselton
who
said
in
a
rather
patronising
kind
of
way
joke
pooter
is
extremely
appropriate
if
not
altogether
thinking
this
rather
a
snub
i
said
fosselton
i
he
interrupted
me
by
saying
if
you
please
which
made
me
quite
forget
what
i
was
going
to
say
to
him
during
the
supper
again
monopolised
the
conversation
with
his
irving
talk
and
both
carrie
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
one
can
have
even
too
much
imitation
of
irving
after
supper
got
a
little
too
boisterous
over
his
irving
imitation
and
suddenly
seizing
gowing
by
the
collar
of
his
coat
dug
his
accidentally
of
course
into
neck
and
took
a
piece
of
flesh
out
gowing
was
rightly
annoyed
but
that
man
padge
who
having
declined
our
modest
supper
in
order
that
he
should
not
lose
his
comfortable
chair
burst
into
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
laughter
at
the
little
misadventure
i
was
so
annoyed
at
the
conduct
of
padge
i
said
suppose
you
would
have
laughed
if
he
had
poked
eye
out
to
which
padge
replied
right
and
laughed
more
than
ever
i
think
perhaps
the
greatest
surprise
was
when
we
broke
up
for
said
pooter
glad
you
like
the
imitation
bring
other
november
went
to
town
without
a
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
done
this
during
the
last
week
i
must
be
losing
my
memory
had
it
not
been
for
this
daisy
mutlar
business
i
would
have
written
to
and
told
him
i
should
be
out
this
evening
but
i
fancy
he
is
the
sort
of
young
man
who
would
come
all
the
same
dear
old
cummings
came
in
the
evening
but
gowing
sent
round
a
little
note
saying
he
hoped
i
would
excuse
his
not
turning
up
which
rather
amused
me
he
added
that
his
neck
was
still
painful
of
course
came
but
lupin
never
turned
up
and
imagine
my
utter
disgust
when
that
man
padge
actually
came
again
and
not
even
accompanied
by
gowing
i
was
exasperated
and
said
padge
this
is
a
dear
carrie
fearing
unpleasantness
said
i
suppose
padge
has
only
come
to
see
the
other
irving
padge
said
right
and
took
the
best
chair
again
from
which
he
never
moved
the
whole
evening
my
only
consolation
is
he
takes
no
supper
so
he
is
not
an
expensive
guest
but
i
shall
speak
to
gowing
about
the
matter
the
irving
imitations
and
conversations
occupied
the
whole
evening
till
i
was
sick
of
it
once
we
had
a
rather
heated
discussion
which
was
commenced
by
cummings
saying
that
it
appeared
to
him
that
was
not
only
irving
but
was
in
his
judgment
every
way
as
or
even
i
ventured
to
remark
that
after
all
it
was
but
an
imitation
of
an
original
cummings
said
surely
some
imitations
were
better
than
the
originals
i
made
what
i
considered
a
very
clever
remark
an
original
there
can
be
no
said
quite
impertinently
discuss
me
in
my
presence
if
you
please
and
pooter
i
should
advise
you
to
talk
about
what
you
understand
to
which
that
cad
padge
replied
dear
carrie
saved
the
whole
thing
by
suddenly
saying
be
ellen
dear
imitation
a
bit
liked
but
she
was
so
spontaneous
and
so
funny
that
the
disagreeable
discussion
passed
off
when
they
left
i
very
pointedly
said
to
and
padge
that
we
should
be
engaged
evening
november
a
long
letter
from
fosselton
respecting
last
irving
discussion
i
was
very
angry
and
i
wrote
and
said
i
knew
little
or
nothing
about
stage
matters
was
not
in
the
least
interested
in
them
and
positively
declined
to
be
drawn
into
a
discussion
on
the
subject
even
at
the
risk
of
its
leading
to
a
breach
of
friendship
i
never
wrote
a
more
determined
letter
on
returning
home
at
the
usual
hour
on
saturday
afternoon
i
met
near
the
archway
daisy
mutlar
my
heart
gave
a
leap
i
bowed
rather
stiffly
but
she
affected
not
to
have
seen
me
very
much
annoyed
in
the
evening
by
the
laundress
sending
home
an
odd
sock
sarah
said
she
sent
two
pairs
and
the
laundress
declared
only
a
pair
and
a
half
were
sent
i
spoke
to
carrie
about
it
but
she
rather
testily
replied
am
tired
of
speaking
to
her
you
had
better
go
and
speak
to
her
yourself
she
is
i
did
so
but
the
laundress
declared
that
only
an
odd
sock
was
sent
gowing
passed
into
the
passage
at
this
time
and
was
rude
enough
to
listen
to
the
conversation
and
interrupting
said
waste
the
odd
sock
old
man
do
an
act
of
charity
and
give
it
to
some
poor
man
with
only
one
the
laundress
giggled
like
an
idiot
i
was
disgusted
and
walked
upstairs
for
the
purpose
of
pinning
down
my
collar
as
the
button
had
come
off
the
back
of
my
shirt
when
i
returned
to
the
parlour
gowing
was
retailing
his
idiotic
joke
about
the
odd
sock
and
carrie
was
roaring
with
laughter
i
suppose
i
am
losing
my
sense
of
humour
i
spoke
my
mind
pretty
freely
about
padge
gowing
said
he
had
met
him
only
once
before
that
evening
he
had
been
introduced
by
a
friend
and
as
he
padge
had
a
good
dinner
gowing
wished
to
show
him
some
little
return
upon
my
word
coolness
surpasses
all
belief
lupin
came
in
before
i
could
reply
and
gowing
unfortunately
inquired
after
daisy
mutlar
lupin
shouted
your
own
business
sir
and
bounced
out
of
the
room
slamming
the
door
the
remainder
of
the
night
was
daisy
mutlar
oh
dear
november
curate
preached
a
very
good
sermon
good
indeed
his
appearance
is
never
so
impressive
as
our
dear
old
but
i
am
bound
to
say
his
sermons
are
much
more
impressive
a
rather
annoying
incident
occurred
of
which
i
must
make
mention
fernlosse
who
is
quite
a
grand
lady
living
in
one
of
those
large
houses
in
the
camden
road
stopped
to
speak
to
me
after
church
when
we
were
all
coming
out
i
must
say
i
felt
flattered
for
she
is
thought
a
good
deal
of
i
suppose
she
knew
me
through
seeing
me
so
often
take
round
the
plate
especially
as
she
always
occupies
the
corner
seat
of
the
pew
she
is
a
very
influential
lady
and
may
have
had
something
of
the
utmost
importance
to
say
but
unfortunately
as
she
commenced
to
speak
a
strong
gust
of
wind
came
and
blew
my
hat
off
into
the
middle
of
the
road
i
had
to
run
after
it
and
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
recovering
it
when
i
had
succeeded
in
doing
so
i
found
fernlosse
had
walked
on
with
some
swell
friends
and
i
felt
i
could
not
well
approach
her
now
especially
as
my
hat
was
smothered
with
mud
i
can
not
say
how
disappointed
i
felt
in
the
evening
evening
of
all
others
i
found
an
impertinent
note
from
which
ran
as
follows
pooter
your
junior
by
perhaps
some
twenty
or
thirty
is
sufficient
reason
that
you
ought
to
have
a
longer
record
of
the
things
and
ways
in
this
miniature
of
a
feel
it
is
just
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
the
wheels
of
your
life
travel
so
quickly
round
as
those
of
the
humble
writer
of
these
lines
the
dandy
horse
of
past
days
has
been
known
to
overtake
the
i
make
myself
understood
well
then
permit
me
pooter
to
advise
you
to
accept
the
acknowledge
your
defeat
and
take
your
whipping
gracefully
for
remember
you
threw
down
the
glove
and
i
can
not
claim
to
be
either
mentally
or
physically
a
à
nos
lives
run
in
different
grooves
i
live
for
my
stage
your
life
is
devoted
to
commercial
life
among
my
books
are
of
different
metal
your
life
in
the
city
is
honourable
i
admit
how
can
not
even
you
see
the
ocean
between
us
a
channel
that
prevents
the
meeting
of
our
brains
in
harmonious
accord
ah
but
à
son
have
registered
a
vow
to
mount
the
steps
of
fame
i
may
crawl
i
may
slip
i
may
even
falter
we
are
all
weak
but
the
top
rung
of
the
ladder
i
when
there
my
voice
shall
be
heard
for
i
will
shout
to
the
multitudes
below
for
the
present
i
am
only
an
amateur
and
my
work
is
unknown
forsooth
save
to
a
party
of
friends
with
here
and
there
an
enemy
pooter
let
me
ask
you
is
the
difference
between
the
amateur
and
the
professional
yes
there
is
a
difference
one
is
for
doing
what
the
other
does
as
skilfully
for
i
will
be
too
for
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
my
family
and
friends
have
at
last
elected
to
adopt
the
stage
as
profession
and
when
the
craze
is
will
be
will
make
my
power
known
for
i
my
apparent
there
is
no
living
man
who
can
play
the
richard
as
i
and
i
can
will
be
the
first
to
come
round
and
bend
your
head
in
submission
there
are
many
matters
you
may
understand
but
knowledge
of
the
fine
art
of
acting
is
to
you
an
let
this
discussion
cease
with
this
letter
yours
truly
i
was
disgusted
when
lupin
came
in
i
handed
him
this
impertinent
letter
and
said
boy
in
that
letter
you
can
see
the
true
character
of
your
lupin
to
my
surprise
said
yes
he
showed
me
the
letter
before
he
sent
it
i
think
he
is
right
and
you
ought
to
chapter
xii
a
serious
discussion
concerning
the
use
and
value
of
my
diary
opinion
of
unfortunate
engagement
is
on
again
december
i
open
my
scribbling
diary
i
find
the
words
michaelmas
term
why
this
should
induce
me
to
indulge
in
retrospective
i
know
but
it
does
the
last
few
weeks
of
my
diary
are
of
minimum
interest
the
breaking
off
of
the
engagement
between
lupin
and
daisy
mutlar
has
made
him
a
different
being
and
carrie
a
rather
depressing
companion
she
was
a
little
dull
last
saturday
and
i
thought
to
cheer
her
up
by
reading
some
extracts
from
my
diary
but
she
walked
out
of
the
room
in
the
middle
of
the
reading
without
a
word
on
her
return
i
said
my
diary
bore
you
darling
she
replied
to
my
surprise
really
listening
dear
i
was
obliged
to
leave
to
give
instructions
to
the
laundress
in
consequence
of
some
stuff
she
puts
in
the
water
two
more
of
coloured
shirts
have
run
and
he
says
he
wear
i
said
is
lupin
all
lupin
lupin
lupin
there
was
not
a
single
button
on
my
shirt
yesterday
but
made
no
carrie
simply
replied
should
do
as
all
other
men
do
and
wear
studs
in
fact
i
never
saw
anyone
but
you
wear
buttons
on
the
i
said
certainly
wore
none
yesterday
for
there
were
none
another
thought
that
strikes
me
is
that
gowing
seldom
calls
in
the
evening
and
cummings
never
does
i
fear
they
get
on
well
with
lupin
december
i
was
in
a
retrospective
it
is
i
see
nothing
but
clouds
clouds
clouds
lupin
is
perfectly
intolerable
over
the
daisy
mutlar
business
he
say
what
is
the
cause
of
the
breach
he
is
evidently
condemning
her
conduct
and
yet
if
we
venture
to
agree
with
him
says
he
hear
a
word
against
her
so
what
is
one
to
do
another
thing
which
is
disappointing
to
me
is
that
carrie
and
lupin
take
no
interest
whatever
in
my
diary
i
broached
the
subject
at
the
i
said
was
in
hopes
that
if
anything
ever
happened
to
me
the
diary
would
be
an
endless
source
of
pleasure
to
you
both
to
say
nothing
of
the
chance
of
the
remuneration
which
may
accrue
from
its
being
both
carrie
and
lupin
burst
out
laughing
carrie
was
sorry
for
this
i
could
see
for
she
said
did
not
mean
to
be
rude
dear
charlie
but
truly
i
do
not
think
your
diary
would
sufficiently
interest
the
public
to
be
taken
up
by
a
i
replied
am
sure
it
would
prove
quite
as
interesting
as
some
of
the
ridiculous
reminiscences
that
have
been
published
lately
besides
the
diary
that
makes
the
man
where
would
evelyn
and
pepys
have
been
if
it
had
not
been
for
their
diaries
carrie
said
i
was
quite
a
philosopher
but
lupin
in
a
jeering
tone
said
it
had
been
written
on
larger
paper
we
might
get
a
fair
price
from
a
butterman
for
as
i
am
in
the
prospective
vein
i
vow
the
end
of
this
year
will
see
the
end
of
my
diary
december
annual
invitation
came
to
spend
christmas
with
usual
family
festive
gathering
to
which
we
always
look
forward
lupin
declined
to
go
i
was
astounded
and
expressed
my
surprise
and
disgust
lupin
then
obliged
us
with
the
following
radical
speech
hate
a
family
gathering
at
christmas
what
does
it
mean
why
someone
says
we
miss
poor
uncle
james
who
was
here
last
year
and
we
all
begin
to
snivel
someone
else
says
two
years
since
poor
aunt
liz
used
to
sit
in
that
then
we
all
begin
to
snivel
again
then
another
gloomy
relation
says
i
wonder
whose
turn
it
will
be
next
then
we
all
snivel
again
and
proceed
to
eat
and
drink
too
much
and
they
discover
until
get
up
that
we
have
been
seated
thirteen
at
december
to
the
drapers
in
the
strand
who
this
year
have
turned
out
everything
in
the
shop
and
devoted
the
whole
place
to
the
sale
of
christmas
cards
shop
crowded
with
people
who
seemed
to
take
up
the
cards
rather
roughly
and
after
a
hurried
glance
at
them
throw
them
down
again
i
remarked
to
one
of
the
young
persons
serving
that
carelessness
appeared
to
be
a
disease
with
some
purchasers
the
observation
was
scarcely
out
of
my
mouth
when
my
thick
caught
against
a
large
pile
of
expensive
cards
in
boxes
one
on
top
of
the
other
and
threw
them
down
the
manager
came
forward
looking
very
much
annoyed
and
picking
up
several
cards
from
the
ground
said
to
one
of
the
assistants
with
a
palpable
at
me
these
amongst
the
sixpenny
goods
they
be
sold
for
a
shilling
the
result
was
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
buy
some
of
these
damaged
cards
i
had
to
buy
more
and
pay
more
than
intended
unfortunately
i
did
not
examine
them
all
and
when
i
got
home
i
discovered
a
vulgar
card
with
a
picture
of
a
fat
nurse
with
two
babies
one
black
and
the
other
white
and
the
words
wish
pa
a
merry
i
tore
up
the
card
and
threw
it
away
carrie
said
the
great
disadvantage
of
going
out
in
society
and
increasing
the
number
of
our
friends
was
that
we
should
have
to
send
out
nearly
two
dozen
cards
this
year
december
save
the
postman
a
miserable
christmas
we
follow
the
example
of
all
unselfish
people
and
send
out
our
cards
early
most
of
the
cards
had
which
i
did
not
notice
at
night
i
shall
buy
all
future
cards
in
the
daytime
lupin
who
ever
since
he
has
had
the
appointment
with
a
stock
and
share
broker
does
not
seem
in
his
dealings
told
me
never
to
rub
out
the
pencilled
price
on
the
backs
of
the
cards
i
asked
him
why
lupin
said
your
card
is
marked
well
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
pencil
a
a
long
after
of
the
ninepence
and
people
will
think
you
have
given
five
times
the
price
for
in
the
evening
lupin
was
very
and
i
reminded
him
that
behind
the
clouds
the
sun
was
shining
he
said
it
never
shines
on
i
said
lupin
my
boy
you
are
worried
about
daisy
mutlar
think
of
her
any
more
you
ought
to
congratulate
yourself
on
having
got
off
a
very
bad
bargain
her
notions
are
far
too
grand
for
our
simple
he
jumped
up
and
said
allow
one
word
to
be
uttered
against
her
worth
the
whole
bunch
of
your
friends
put
together
that
inflated
of
a
perkupp
i
left
the
room
with
silent
dignity
but
caught
my
foot
in
the
mat
december
exchanged
no
words
with
lupin
in
the
morning
but
as
he
seemed
to
be
in
exuberant
spirits
in
the
evening
i
ventured
to
ask
him
where
he
intended
to
spend
his
christmas
he
replied
most
likely
at
the
in
wonderment
i
said
after
your
engagement
has
been
broken
off
lupin
said
said
it
is
off
i
said
have
given
us
both
to
he
interrupted
me
by
saying
never
mind
what
i
said
is
on
chapter
xiii
i
receive
an
insulting
christmas
card
we
spend
a
pleasant
christmas
at
a
moss
is
rather
too
free
a
boisterous
evening
during
which
i
am
struck
in
the
dark
i
receive
an
extraordinary
letter
from
mutlar
senior
respecting
lupin
we
miss
drinking
out
the
old
year
december
am
a
poor
man
but
i
would
gladly
give
ten
shillings
to
find
out
who
sent
me
the
insulting
christmas
card
i
received
this
morning
i
never
insult
people
why
should
they
insult
me
the
worst
part
of
the
transaction
is
that
i
find
myself
suspecting
all
my
friends
the
handwriting
on
the
envelope
is
evidently
disguised
being
written
sloping
the
wrong
way
i
can
not
think
either
gowing
or
cummings
would
do
such
a
mean
thing
lupin
denied
all
knowledge
of
it
and
i
believe
him
although
i
disapprove
of
his
laughing
and
sympathising
with
the
offender
franching
would
be
above
such
an
act
and
i
think
any
of
the
mutlars
would
descend
to
such
a
course
i
wonder
if
pitt
that
impudent
clerk
at
the
office
did
it
or
birrell
the
charwoman
or
the
writing
is
too
good
for
the
former
christmas
caught
the
train
at
paddington
and
spent
a
pleasant
day
at
the
country
was
quite
nice
and
pleasant
although
the
roads
were
sloppy
we
dined
in
the
middle
of
the
day
just
ten
of
us
and
talked
over
old
times
if
everybody
had
a
nice
such
as
i
have
what
a
deal
of
happiness
there
would
be
in
the
world
being
all
in
good
spirits
i
proposed
her
health
and
i
made
i
think
a
very
good
speech
i
concluded
rather
neatly
by
saying
an
occasion
like
relatives
friends
or
acquaintances
are
all
inspired
with
good
feelings
towards
each
other
we
are
of
one
mind
and
think
only
of
love
and
friendship
those
who
have
quarrelled
with
absent
friends
should
kiss
and
make
it
up
those
who
happily
have
not
fallen
out
can
kiss
all
the
i
saw
the
tears
in
the
eyes
of
both
carrie
and
her
mother
and
must
say
i
felt
very
flattered
by
the
compliment
that
dear
old
reverend
john
panzy
smith
who
married
us
made
a
most
cheerful
and
amusing
speech
and
said
he
should
act
on
my
suggestion
respecting
the
kissing
he
then
walked
round
the
table
and
kissed
all
the
ladies
including
carrie
of
course
one
did
not
object
to
this
but
i
was
more
than
staggered
when
a
young
fellow
named
moss
who
was
a
stranger
to
me
and
who
had
scarcely
spoken
a
word
through
dinner
jumped
up
suddenly
with
a
sprig
of
misletoe
and
exclaimed
i
see
why
i
be
on
in
this
before
one
could
realise
what
he
was
about
to
do
he
kissed
carrie
and
the
rest
of
the
ladies
fortunately
the
matter
was
treated
as
a
joke
and
we
all
laughed
but
it
was
a
dangerous
experiment
and
i
felt
very
uneasy
for
a
moment
as
to
the
result
i
subsequently
referred
to
the
matter
to
carrie
but
she
said
not
much
more
than
a
i
said
that
he
had
a
very
large
moustache
for
a
boy
carrie
replied
say
he
was
not
a
nice
december
did
not
sleep
very
well
last
night
i
never
do
in
a
strange
bed
i
feel
a
little
indigestion
which
one
must
expect
at
this
time
of
the
year
carrie
and
i
returned
to
town
in
the
evening
lupin
came
in
late
he
said
he
enjoyed
his
christmas
and
added
feel
as
fit
as
a
lowther
arcade
fiddle
and
only
require
a
little
more
to
feel
as
fit
as
a
i
have
long
since
given
up
trying
to
understand
slang
or
asking
him
to
explain
it
december
told
lupin
i
was
expecting
gowing
and
cummings
to
drop
in
evening
for
a
quiet
game
i
was
in
hope
the
boy
would
volunteer
to
stay
in
and
help
to
amuse
them
instead
of
which
he
said
you
had
better
put
them
off
as
i
have
asked
daisy
and
frank
mutlar
to
i
said
i
could
not
think
of
doing
such
a
thing
lupin
said
i
will
send
a
wire
and
put
off
i
suggested
that
a
or
letter
would
reach
her
quite
soon
enough
and
would
not
be
so
extravagant
carrie
who
had
listened
to
the
above
conversation
with
apparent
annoyance
directed
a
shaft
at
lupin
she
said
why
do
you
object
to
daisy
meeting
your
friends
is
it
because
they
are
not
good
enough
for
her
or
which
is
equally
possible
is
not
good
enough
for
them
lupin
was
dumbfounded
and
could
make
no
reply
when
he
left
the
room
i
gave
carrie
a
kiss
of
approval
december
on
coming
down
to
breakfast
said
to
his
mother
have
not
put
off
daisy
and
frank
and
should
like
them
to
join
gowing
and
cummings
this
i
felt
very
pleased
with
the
boy
for
this
carrie
said
in
reply
am
glad
you
let
me
know
in
time
as
i
can
turn
over
the
cold
leg
of
mutton
dress
it
with
a
little
parsley
and
no
one
will
know
it
has
been
she
further
said
she
would
make
a
few
custards
and
stew
some
pippins
so
that
they
would
be
cold
by
the
evening
finding
lupin
in
good
spirits
i
asked
him
quietly
if
he
really
had
any
personal
objection
to
either
gowing
or
cummings
he
replied
in
the
least
i
think
cummings
looks
rather
an
ass
but
that
is
partly
due
to
his
patronising
hat
company
and
wearing
a
as
for
that
perpetual
brown
velveteen
jacket
of
he
resembles
an
itinerant
i
said
it
was
not
the
coat
that
made
the
gentleman
whereupon
lupin
with
a
laugh
replied
and
it
much
of
a
gentleman
who
made
their
we
were
rather
jolly
at
supper
and
daisy
made
herself
very
agreeable
especially
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
evening
when
she
sang
at
supper
however
she
said
you
make
with
bread
and
she
commenced
rolling
up
pieces
of
bread
and
twisting
them
round
on
the
table
i
felt
this
to
be
bad
manners
but
of
course
said
nothing
presently
daisy
and
lupin
to
my
disgust
began
throwing
at
each
other
frank
followed
suit
and
so
did
cummings
and
gowing
to
my
astonishment
they
then
commenced
throwing
hard
pieces
of
crust
one
piece
catching
me
on
the
forehead
and
making
me
blink
i
said
please
steady
frank
jumped
up
and
said
tum
then
the
band
i
did
not
know
what
this
meant
but
they
all
roared
and
continued
the
gowing
suddenly
seized
all
the
parsley
off
the
cold
mutton
and
threw
it
full
in
my
face
i
looked
daggers
at
gowing
who
replied
say
no
good
trying
to
look
indignant
with
your
hair
full
of
i
rose
from
the
table
and
insisted
that
a
stop
should
be
put
to
this
foolery
at
once
frank
mutlar
shouted
gentlemen
please
time
and
turned
out
the
gas
leaving
us
in
absolute
darkness
i
was
feeling
my
way
out
of
the
room
when
i
suddenly
received
a
hard
intentional
punch
at
the
back
of
my
head
i
said
loudly
did
that
there
was
no
answer
so
i
repeated
the
question
with
the
same
result
i
struck
a
match
and
lighted
the
gas
they
were
all
talking
and
laughing
so
i
kept
my
own
counsel
but
after
they
had
gone
i
said
to
carrie
person
who
sent
me
that
insulting
at
christmas
was
here
december
had
a
most
vivid
dream
last
night
i
woke
up
and
on
falling
asleep
dreamed
the
same
dream
over
again
precisely
i
dreamt
i
heard
frank
mutlar
telling
his
sister
that
he
had
not
only
sent
me
the
insulting
christmas
card
but
admitted
that
he
was
the
one
who
punched
my
head
last
night
in
the
dark
as
fate
would
have
it
lupin
at
breakfast
was
reading
extracts
from
a
letter
he
had
just
received
from
frank
i
asked
him
to
pass
the
envelope
that
i
might
compare
the
writing
he
did
so
and
i
examined
it
by
the
side
of
the
envelope
containing
the
christmas
card
i
detected
a
similarity
in
the
writing
in
spite
of
the
attempted
disguise
i
passed
them
on
to
carrie
who
began
to
laugh
i
asked
her
what
she
was
laughing
at
and
she
said
the
card
was
never
directed
to
me
at
all
it
was
pooter
not
lupin
asked
to
look
at
the
direction
and
the
card
and
exclaimed
with
a
laugh
yes
meant
for
i
said
you
in
the
habit
of
receiving
insulting
christmas
cards
he
replied
yes
and
of
them
in
the
evening
gowing
called
and
said
he
enjoyed
himself
very
much
last
night
i
took
the
opportunity
to
confide
in
him
as
an
old
friend
about
the
vicious
punch
last
night
he
burst
out
laughing
and
said
it
was
was
it
i
know
i
accidentally
hit
something
but
i
thought
it
was
a
brick
i
told
him
i
felt
hurt
in
both
senses
of
the
expression
december
spent
the
whole
day
with
the
mutlars
he
seemed
rather
cheerful
in
the
evening
so
i
said
glad
to
see
you
so
happy
he
answered
daisy
is
a
splendid
girl
but
i
was
obliged
to
take
her
old
fool
of
a
father
down
a
peg
what
with
his
meanness
over
his
cigars
his
stinginess
over
his
drinks
his
farthing
economy
in
turning
down
the
gas
if
you
only
quit
the
room
for
a
second
writing
to
one
on
of
sticking
the
remnant
of
the
last
cake
of
soap
on
to
the
new
cake
putting
two
bricks
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
and
his
general
i
was
compelled
to
let
him
have
a
bit
of
my
i
said
you
are
not
much
more
than
a
boy
i
hope
you
repent
december
last
day
of
the
old
year
i
received
an
extraordinary
letter
from
mutlar
senior
he
writes
sir
a
long
time
past
i
have
had
considerable
difficulty
deciding
the
important
question
is
the
master
of
my
own
house
myself
or
lupin
believe
me
i
have
no
prejudice
one
way
or
the
other
but
i
have
been
most
reluctantly
compelled
to
give
judgment
to
the
effect
that
i
am
the
master
of
it
under
the
circumstances
it
has
become
my
duty
to
forbid
your
son
to
enter
my
house
again
i
am
sorry
because
it
deprives
me
of
the
society
of
one
of
the
most
modest
unassuming
and
gentlemanly
persons
i
have
ever
had
the
honour
of
being
acquainted
i
did
not
desire
the
last
day
to
wind
up
disagreeably
so
i
said
nothing
to
either
carrie
or
lupin
about
the
letter
a
most
terrible
fog
came
on
and
lupin
would
go
out
in
it
but
promised
to
be
back
to
drink
out
the
old
custom
we
have
always
observed
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
lupin
had
not
returned
and
the
fog
was
fearful
as
time
was
drawing
close
i
got
out
the
spirits
carrie
and
i
deciding
on
whisky
i
opened
a
fresh
bottle
but
carrie
said
it
smelt
like
brandy
as
i
knew
it
to
be
whisky
i
said
there
was
nothing
to
discuss
carrie
evidently
vexed
that
lupin
had
not
come
in
did
discuss
it
all
the
same
and
wanted
me
to
have
a
small
wager
with
her
to
decide
by
the
smell
i
said
i
could
decide
it
by
the
taste
in
a
moment
a
silly
and
unnecessary
argument
followed
the
result
of
which
was
we
suddenly
saw
it
was
a
twelve
and
for
the
first
time
in
our
married
life
we
missed
welcoming
in
the
new
year
lupin
got
home
at
a
two
having
got
lost
in
the
he
said
chapter
xiv
begin
the
year
with
an
unexpected
promotion
at
the
office
i
make
two
good
jokes
i
get
an
enormous
rise
in
my
salary
lupin
speculates
successfully
and
starts
a
have
to
speak
to
sarah
extraordinary
conduct
of
january
had
intended
concluding
my
diary
last
week
but
a
most
important
event
has
happened
so
i
shall
continue
for
a
little
while
longer
on
the
attached
to
the
end
of
my
last
diary
it
had
just
struck
one
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
office
to
have
my
dinner
when
i
received
a
message
that
perkupp
desired
to
see
me
at
once
i
must
confess
that
my
heart
commenced
to
beat
and
i
had
most
serious
misgivings
perkupp
was
in
his
room
writing
and
he
said
a
seat
pooter
i
shall
not
be
a
i
replied
thank
you
sir
i
watched
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
and
i
was
waiting
quite
twenty
minutes
but
it
seemed
hours
perkupp
at
last
got
up
himself
i
said
hope
there
is
nothing
wrong
sir
he
replied
dear
no
quite
the
reverse
i
what
a
weight
off
my
mind
my
breath
seemed
to
come
back
again
in
an
instant
perkupp
said
buckling
is
going
to
retire
and
there
will
be
some
slight
changes
in
the
office
you
have
been
with
us
nearly
years
and
in
consequence
of
your
conduct
during
that
period
we
intend
making
a
special
promotion
in
your
favour
we
have
not
quite
decided
how
you
will
be
placed
but
in
any
case
there
will
be
a
considerable
increase
in
your
salary
which
it
is
quite
unnecessary
for
me
to
say
you
fully
deserve
i
have
an
appointment
at
two
but
you
shall
hear
more
he
then
left
the
room
quickly
and
i
was
not
even
allowed
time
or
thought
to
express
a
single
word
of
grateful
thanks
to
him
i
need
not
say
how
dear
carrie
received
this
joyful
news
with
perfect
simplicity
she
said
last
we
shall
be
able
to
have
a
for
the
back
which
we
always
i
added
and
at
last
you
shall
have
that
little
costume
which
you
saw
at
peter
so
january
was
in
a
great
state
of
suspense
all
day
at
the
office
i
did
not
like
to
worry
perkupp
but
as
he
did
not
send
for
me
and
mentioned
yesterday
that
he
would
see
me
again
i
thought
it
better
perhaps
to
go
to
him
i
knocked
at
his
door
and
on
entering
perkupp
said
you
pooter
do
you
want
to
see
me
i
said
sir
i
thought
you
wanted
to
see
me
he
replied
remember
well
i
am
very
busy
i
will
see
you
january
in
a
state
of
anxiety
and
excitement
which
was
not
alleviated
by
ascertaining
that
perkupp
sent
word
he
should
not
be
at
the
office
in
the
evening
lupin
who
was
busily
engaged
with
a
paper
said
suddenly
to
me
you
know
anything
about
guv
i
said
my
boy
not
that
aware
lupin
said
i
give
you
the
tip
are
as
safe
as
consols
and
pay
six
per
cent
at
i
said
a
rather
neat
thing
viz
may
be
six
per
cent
at
but
your
has
no
money
to
carrie
and
i
both
roared
with
laughter
lupin
did
not
take
the
slightest
notice
of
the
joke
although
i
purposely
repeated
it
for
him
but
continued
give
you
the
tip
i
said
another
funny
thing
you
fall
into
them
lupin
put
on
a
supercilious
smile
and
said
joe
january
perkupp
sent
for
me
and
told
me
that
my
position
would
be
that
of
one
of
the
senior
clerks
i
was
more
than
overjoyed
perkupp
added
he
would
let
me
know
what
the
salary
would
be
this
means
another
anxiety
i
mind
for
it
is
anxiety
of
the
right
sort
that
reminded
me
that
i
had
forgotten
to
speak
to
lupin
about
the
letter
i
received
from
mutlar
senr
i
broached
the
subject
to
lupin
in
the
evening
having
first
consulted
carrie
lupin
was
riveted
to
the
as
if
he
had
been
a
born
capitalist
and
i
said
me
a
moment
lupin
how
is
it
you
have
not
been
to
the
any
day
this
week
lupin
answered
told
you
i
can
not
stand
old
i
said
mutlar
writes
to
me
to
say
pretty
plainly
that
he
can
not
stand
you
lupin
said
i
like
his
cheek
in
writing
to
find
out
if
his
father
is
still
alive
and
i
will
write
a
note
complaining
of
son
and
state
pretty
clearly
that
his
son
is
a
blithering
idiot
i
said
please
moderate
your
expressions
in
the
presence
of
your
lupin
said
very
sorry
but
there
is
no
other
expression
one
can
apply
to
him
however
determined
not
to
enter
his
place
i
said
know
lupin
he
has
forbidden
you
the
lupin
replied
we
split
all
the
same
daisy
is
a
trump
and
will
wait
for
me
ten
years
if
january
can
scarcely
write
the
news
perkupp
told
me
my
salary
would
be
raised
i
stood
gaping
for
a
moment
unable
to
realise
it
i
annually
get
rise
and
i
thought
it
might
be
or
even
but
surpasses
all
belief
carrie
and
i
both
rejoiced
over
our
good
fortune
lupin
came
home
in
the
evening
in
the
utmost
good
spirits
i
sent
sarah
quietly
round
to
the
for
a
bottle
of
champagne
the
same
as
we
had
before
it
was
opened
at
supper
and
i
said
to
lupin
is
to
celebrate
some
good
news
i
have
received
lupin
replied
and
i
have
some
good
news
also
a
double
event
eh
i
said
boy
as
a
result
of
industry
and
strict
attention
to
the
interests
of
my
superiors
in
office
i
have
been
rewarded
with
promotion
and
a
rise
in
salary
of
lupin
gave
three
cheers
and
we
rapped
the
table
furiously
which
brought
in
sarah
to
see
what
the
matter
was
lupin
ordered
us
to
again
and
addressing
us
upstanding
said
been
in
the
firm
of
job
cleanands
stock
and
a
few
weeks
and
not
having
paid
particular
attention
to
the
interests
of
my
superiors
in
office
my
as
a
reward
to
me
allotted
me
worth
of
shares
in
a
really
good
thing
the
result
is
i
have
made
i
said
you
are
the
good
old
truth
job
cleanands
me
on
to
january
am
very
much
concerned
at
lupin
having
started
a
i
said
are
you
justified
in
this
outrageous
extravagance
lupin
replied
one
must
get
to
the
city
somehow
only
hired
it
and
can
give
it
up
any
time
i
i
repeated
my
question
you
justified
in
this
extravagance
he
replied
here
excuse
me
saying
so
but
a
bit
out
of
date
it
does
not
pay
nowadays
fiddling
about
over
small
things
i
mean
anything
personal
my
boss
says
if
i
take
his
tip
and
stick
to
big
things
i
can
make
big
money
i
said
i
thought
the
very
idea
of
speculation
most
horrifying
lupin
said
is
not
speculation
a
dead
i
advised
him
at
all
events
not
to
continue
the
pony
and
cart
but
he
replied
made
in
one
day
now
suppose
i
only
make
in
a
month
or
put
it
at
a
month
which
is
ridiculously
that
is
a
year
a
few
pounds
a
week
for
a
trap
i
did
not
pursue
the
subject
further
beyond
saying
that
i
should
feel
glad
when
the
autumn
came
and
lupin
would
be
of
age
and
responsible
for
his
own
debts
he
answered
dear
i
promise
you
faithfully
that
i
will
never
speculate
with
what
i
have
not
got
i
shall
only
go
on
job
tips
and
as
he
is
in
the
it
is
pretty
safe
i
felt
somewhat
relieved
gowing
called
in
the
evening
and
to
my
surprise
informed
me
that
as
he
had
made
by
one
of
tips
he
intended
asking
us
and
the
cummings
round
next
saturday
carrie
and
i
said
we
should
be
delighted
january
generally
lose
my
temper
with
servants
but
i
had
to
speak
to
sarah
rather
sharply
about
a
careless
habit
she
has
recently
contracted
of
shaking
the
after
removing
the
breakfast
things
in
a
manner
which
causes
all
the
crumbs
to
fall
on
the
carpet
eventually
to
be
trodden
in
sarah
answered
very
rudely
you
are
always
i
replied
i
am
not
i
spoke
to
you
last
week
about
walking
all
over
the
carpet
with
a
piece
of
yellow
soap
on
the
heel
of
your
she
said
always
grumbling
about
your
i
said
i
am
not
but
i
feel
perfectly
justified
in
complaining
that
i
never
can
get
a
egg
the
moment
i
crack
the
shell
it
spurts
all
over
the
plate
and
i
have
spoken
to
you
at
least
fifty
times
about
she
began
to
cry
and
make
a
scene
but
fortunately
my
came
by
so
i
had
a
good
excuse
for
leaving
her
gowing
left
a
message
in
the
evening
that
we
were
not
to
forget
next
saturday
carrie
amusingly
said
he
has
never
asked
any
friends
before
we
are
not
likely
to
forget
january
asked
lupin
to
try
and
change
the
hard
brushes
he
recently
made
me
a
present
of
for
some
softer
ones
as
my
tells
me
i
ought
not
to
brush
my
hair
too
much
just
now
january
new
came
home
for
the
back
carrie
arranged
some
fans
very
prettily
on
the
top
and
on
each
side
it
is
an
immense
improvement
to
the
room
january
had
just
finished
our
tea
when
who
should
come
in
but
cummings
who
has
not
been
here
for
over
three
weeks
i
noticed
that
he
looked
anything
but
well
so
i
said
cummings
how
are
you
you
look
a
little
he
replied
and
i
feel
blue
i
said
the
matter
he
said
nothing
except
that
i
have
been
on
my
back
for
a
couple
of
weeks
all
at
one
time
my
doctor
nearly
gave
me
up
yet
not
a
soul
has
come
near
me
no
one
has
even
taken
the
trouble
to
inquire
whether
i
was
alive
or
i
said
is
the
first
i
have
heard
of
it
i
have
passed
your
house
several
nights
and
presumed
you
had
company
as
the
rooms
were
so
brilliantly
cummings
replied
the
only
company
i
have
had
was
my
wife
the
doctor
and
the
having
turned
out
a
perfect
trump
i
wonder
you
did
not
see
it
in
the
paper
i
know
it
was
mentioned
in
the
i
thought
to
cheer
him
up
and
said
you
are
all
right
now
he
replied
not
the
question
the
question
is
whether
an
illness
does
not
enable
you
to
discover
who
are
your
i
said
such
an
observation
was
unworthy
of
him
to
make
matters
worse
in
came
gowing
who
gave
cummings
a
violent
slap
on
the
back
and
said
have
you
seen
a
ghost
you
look
scared
to
death
like
irving
in
i
said
gowing
the
poor
fellow
has
been
very
gowing
roared
with
laughter
and
said
and
you
look
it
cummings
quietly
said
and
i
feel
it
that
i
suppose
you
an
awkward
silence
followed
gowing
said
mind
cummings
you
and
the
missis
come
round
to
my
place
and
it
will
cheer
you
up
a
bit
for
open
a
bottle
of
january
extraordinary
thing
happened
carrie
and
i
went
round
to
as
arranged
at
seven
we
knocked
and
rang
several
times
without
getting
an
answer
at
last
the
latch
was
drawn
and
the
door
opened
a
little
way
the
chain
still
being
up
a
man
in
put
his
head
through
and
said
is
it
what
do
you
want
i
said
gowing
he
is
expecting
the
man
said
as
well
as
i
could
hear
owing
to
the
yapping
of
a
little
dog
think
he
is
gowing
is
not
at
i
said
will
be
in
with
that
observation
he
slammed
the
door
leaving
carrie
and
me
standing
on
the
steps
with
a
cutting
wind
blowing
round
the
corner
carrie
advised
me
to
knock
again
i
did
so
and
then
discovered
for
the
first
time
that
the
knocker
had
been
newly
painted
and
the
paint
had
come
off
on
my
were
in
consequence
completely
spoiled
i
knocked
at
the
door
with
my
stick
two
or
three
times
the
man
opened
the
door
taking
the
chain
off
this
time
and
began
abusing
me
he
said
do
you
mean
by
scratching
the
paint
with
your
stick
like
that
spoiling
the
varnish
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
i
said
me
gowing
he
interrupted
and
said
care
for
gowing
or
any
of
his
friends
this
is
door
not
there
are
people
here
besides
the
impertinence
of
this
man
was
nothing
i
scarcely
noticed
it
it
was
so
trivial
in
comparison
with
the
scandalous
conduct
of
gowing
at
this
moment
cummings
and
his
wife
arrived
cummings
was
very
lame
and
leaning
on
a
stick
but
got
up
the
steps
and
asked
what
the
matter
was
the
man
said
gowing
said
nothing
about
expecting
anyone
all
he
said
was
he
had
just
received
an
invitation
to
croydon
and
he
should
not
be
back
till
monday
evening
he
took
his
bag
with
with
that
he
slammed
the
door
again
i
was
too
indignant
with
conduct
to
say
anything
cummings
looked
white
with
rage
and
as
he
descended
the
steps
struck
his
stick
violently
on
the
ground
and
said
chapter
xv
gowing
explains
his
conduct
lupin
takes
us
for
a
drive
which
we
enjoy
lupin
introduces
us
to
murray
posh
february
does
seem
hard
i
can
not
get
good
sausages
for
breakfast
they
are
either
full
of
bread
or
spice
or
are
as
red
as
beef
still
anxious
about
the
i
invested
last
week
by
advice
however
cummings
has
done
the
same
february
a
fortnight
has
passed
and
i
have
neither
seen
nor
heard
from
gowing
respecting
his
extraordinary
conduct
in
asking
us
round
to
his
house
and
then
being
out
in
the
evening
carrie
was
engaged
marking
a
new
collars
i
had
purchased
back
marking
against
while
i
was
drying
them
at
the
fire
and
carrie
was
rebuking
me
for
scorching
them
cummings
came
in
he
seemed
quite
well
again
and
chaffed
us
about
marking
the
collars
i
asked
him
if
he
had
heard
from
gowing
and
he
replied
that
he
had
not
i
said
i
should
not
have
believed
that
gowing
could
have
acted
in
such
an
ungentlemanly
manner
cummings
said
are
mild
in
your
description
of
him
i
think
he
has
acted
like
a
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
when
the
door
opened
and
gowing
putting
in
his
head
said
i
come
in
i
said
carrie
said
very
pointedly
you
a
gowing
said
been
on
and
off
to
croydon
during
the
last
i
could
see
cummings
was
boiling
over
and
eventually
he
tackled
gowing
very
strongly
respecting
his
conduct
last
saturday
week
gowing
appeared
surprised
and
said
i
posted
a
letter
to
you
in
the
morning
announcing
that
the
party
was
very
much
i
said
never
got
gowing
turning
to
carrie
said
suppose
letters
sometimes
they
carrie
cummings
sharply
said
is
not
a
time
for
joking
i
had
no
notice
of
the
party
being
put
gowing
replied
told
pooter
in
my
note
to
tell
you
as
i
was
in
a
hurry
however
inquire
at
the
and
we
must
meet
again
at
my
i
added
that
i
hoped
he
would
be
present
at
the
next
meeting
carrie
roared
at
this
and
even
cummings
could
not
help
laughing
february
to
my
wishes
carrie
allowed
lupin
to
persuade
her
to
take
her
for
a
drive
in
the
afternoon
in
his
trap
i
quite
disapprove
of
driving
on
a
sunday
but
i
did
not
like
to
trust
carrie
alone
with
lupin
so
i
offered
to
go
too
lupin
said
that
is
nice
of
you
but
you
mind
sitting
on
the
of
the
cart
lupin
proceeded
to
put
on
a
coat
that
seemed
miles
too
large
for
him
carrie
said
it
wanted
taking
in
considerably
at
the
back
lupin
said
you
seen
a
before
you
drive
in
anything
he
may
wear
what
he
likes
in
the
future
for
i
shall
never
drive
with
him
again
his
conduct
was
shocking
when
we
passed
highgate
archway
he
tried
to
pass
everything
and
everybody
he
shouted
to
respectable
people
who
were
walking
quietly
in
the
road
to
get
out
of
the
way
he
flicked
at
the
horse
of
an
old
man
who
was
riding
causing
it
to
rear
and
as
i
had
to
ride
backwards
i
was
compelled
to
face
a
gang
of
roughs
in
a
whom
lupin
had
chaffed
and
who
turned
and
followed
us
for
nearly
a
mile
bellowing
indulging
in
coarse
jokes
and
laughter
to
say
nothing
of
occasionally
pelting
us
with
the
prince
of
wales
would
have
to
put
up
with
the
same
sort
of
thing
if
he
drove
to
the
of
little
consolation
to
either
carrie
or
myself
frank
mutlar
called
in
the
evening
and
lupin
went
out
with
him
february
a
little
concerned
about
lupin
i
mustered
up
courage
to
speak
to
perkupp
about
him
perkupp
has
always
been
most
kind
to
me
so
i
told
him
everything
including
adventure
perkupp
kindly
replied
is
no
necessity
for
you
to
be
anxious
pooter
it
would
be
impossible
for
a
son
of
such
good
parents
to
turn
out
erroneously
remember
he
is
young
and
will
soon
get
older
i
wish
we
could
find
room
for
him
in
this
the
advice
of
this
good
man
takes
loads
off
my
mind
in
the
evening
lupin
came
in
after
our
little
supper
he
said
dear
parents
i
have
some
news
which
i
fear
will
affect
you
i
felt
a
qualm
come
over
me
and
said
nothing
lupin
then
said
may
distress
fact
sure
it
this
afternoon
i
have
given
up
my
pony
and
trap
for
it
may
seem
absurd
but
i
was
so
pleased
i
immediately
opened
a
bottle
of
port
gowing
dropped
in
just
in
time
bringing
with
him
a
large
sheet
with
a
print
of
a
tailless
donkey
which
he
fastened
against
the
wall
he
then
produced
several
separate
tails
and
we
spent
the
remainder
of
the
evening
trying
blindfolded
to
pin
a
tail
on
in
the
proper
place
my
sides
positively
ached
with
laughter
when
i
went
to
bed
february
the
evening
i
spoke
to
lupin
about
his
engagement
with
daisy
mutlar
i
asked
if
he
had
heard
from
her
he
replied
she
promised
that
old
windbag
of
a
father
of
hers
that
she
would
not
communicate
with
me
i
see
frank
mutlar
of
course
in
fact
he
said
he
might
call
again
this
frank
called
but
said
he
could
not
stop
as
he
had
a
friend
waiting
outside
for
him
named
murray
posh
adding
he
was
quite
a
swell
carrie
asked
frank
to
bring
him
in
he
was
brought
in
gowing
entering
at
the
same
time
murray
posh
was
a
tall
fat
young
man
and
was
evidently
of
a
very
nervous
disposition
as
he
subsequently
confessed
he
would
never
go
in
a
hansom
cab
nor
would
he
enter
a
until
the
driver
had
first
got
on
the
box
with
his
reins
in
his
hands
on
being
introduced
gowing
with
his
usual
want
of
tact
said
relation
to
posh
replied
but
please
understand
i
try
on
hats
myself
i
take
no
part
in
the
i
replied
wish
i
had
a
business
like
posh
seemed
pleased
and
gave
a
long
but
most
interesting
history
of
the
extraordinary
difficulties
in
the
manufacture
of
cheap
hats
murray
posh
evidently
knew
daisy
mutlar
very
intimately
from
the
way
he
was
talking
of
her
and
frank
said
to
lupin
once
laughingly
you
look
out
posh
will
cut
you
out
when
they
had
all
gone
i
referred
to
this
flippant
conversation
and
lupin
said
sarcastically
man
who
is
jealous
has
no
respect
for
himself
a
man
who
would
be
jealous
of
an
elephant
like
murray
posh
could
only
have
a
contempt
for
himself
i
know
daisy
she
wait
ten
years
for
me
as
i
said
before
in
fact
if
necessary
would
wait
twenty
years
for
chapter
xvi
we
lose
money
over
advice
as
to
investment
so
does
cummings
murray
posh
engaged
to
daisy
mutlar
february
has
several
times
recently
called
attention
to
the
thinness
of
my
hair
at
the
top
of
my
head
and
recommended
me
to
get
it
seen
to
i
was
this
morning
trying
to
look
at
it
by
the
aid
of
a
small
when
somehow
my
elbow
caught
against
the
edge
of
the
chest
of
drawers
and
knocked
the
glass
out
of
my
hand
and
smashed
it
carrie
was
in
an
awful
way
about
it
as
she
is
rather
absurdly
superstitious
to
make
matters
worse
my
large
photograph
in
the
fell
during
the
night
and
the
glass
cracked
carrie
said
my
words
charles
some
misfortune
is
about
to
i
said
in
the
evening
lupin
arrived
home
early
and
seemed
a
little
agitated
i
said
up
my
boy
he
hesitated
a
good
deal
and
then
said
know
those
parachikka
chlorates
i
advised
you
to
invest
in
i
replied
they
are
all
right
i
trust
he
replied
no
to
the
surprise
of
everybody
they
have
utterly
my
breath
was
so
completely
taken
away
i
could
say
nothing
carrie
looked
at
me
and
said
did
i
tell
you
lupin
after
a
while
said
you
are
specially
fortunate
i
received
an
early
tip
and
sold
out
yours
immediately
and
was
fortunate
to
get
for
them
so
you
get
something
after
i
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
i
said
was
not
so
sanguine
as
to
suppose
as
you
predicted
that
i
should
get
six
or
eight
times
the
amount
of
my
investment
still
a
profit
of
is
a
good
percentage
for
such
a
short
lupin
said
quite
irritably
understand
i
sold
your
shares
for
you
therefore
lose
on
the
transaction
whereby
cummings
and
gowing
will
lose
the
whole
of
february
before
going
to
town
said
am
very
sorry
about
those
parachikka
chlorates
it
would
not
have
happened
if
the
boss
job
cleanands
had
been
in
town
between
ourselves
you
must
not
be
surprised
if
something
goes
wrong
at
our
office
job
cleanands
has
not
been
seen
the
last
few
days
and
it
strikes
me
several
people
want
to
see
him
very
in
the
evening
lupin
was
just
on
the
point
of
going
out
to
avoid
a
collision
with
gowing
and
cummings
when
the
former
entered
the
room
without
knocking
but
with
his
usual
trick
of
saying
i
come
in
he
entered
and
to
the
surprise
of
lupin
and
myself
seemed
to
be
in
the
very
best
of
spirits
neither
lupin
nor
i
broached
the
subject
to
him
but
he
did
so
of
his
own
accord
he
said
say
those
parachikka
chlorates
have
gone
an
awful
smash
a
nice
one
master
lupin
how
much
do
you
lose
lupin
to
my
utter
astonishment
said
i
had
nothing
in
them
there
was
some
informality
in
my
forgot
to
enclose
the
cheque
or
something
and
i
get
any
the
guv
loses
i
said
quite
understood
you
were
in
it
or
nothing
would
have
induced
me
to
lupin
replied
it
be
helped
you
must
go
double
on
the
next
before
i
could
reply
gowing
said
i
lose
nothing
fortunately
from
what
i
heard
i
did
not
quite
believe
in
them
so
i
persuaded
cummings
to
take
my
worth
as
he
had
more
faith
in
them
than
i
lupin
burst
out
laughing
and
in
the
most
unseemly
manner
said
poor
cummings
lose
at
that
moment
there
was
a
ring
at
the
bell
lupin
said
want
to
meet
if
he
had
gone
out
of
the
door
he
would
have
met
him
in
the
passage
so
as
quickly
as
possible
lupin
opened
the
parlour
window
and
got
out
gowing
jumped
up
suddenly
exclaiming
want
to
see
him
either
and
before
i
could
say
a
word
he
followed
lupin
out
of
the
window
for
my
own
part
i
was
horrified
to
think
my
own
son
and
one
of
my
most
intimate
friends
should
depart
from
the
house
like
a
couple
of
interrupted
burglars
poor
cummings
was
very
upset
and
of
course
was
naturally
very
angry
both
with
lupin
and
gowing
i
pressed
him
to
have
a
little
whisky
and
he
replied
that
he
had
given
up
whisky
but
would
like
a
little
as
he
was
advised
it
was
the
most
healthy
spirit
i
had
none
in
the
house
but
sent
sarah
round
to
for
some
february
first
thing
that
caught
my
eye
on
opening
the
failure
of
stock
and
share
dealers
job
cleanands
absconded
i
handed
it
to
carrie
and
she
replied
perhaps
for
good
i
never
did
think
it
a
suitable
situation
for
i
thought
the
whole
affair
very
shocking
lupin
came
down
to
breakfast
and
seeing
he
looked
painfully
distressed
i
said
know
the
news
my
dear
boy
and
feel
very
sorry
for
lupin
said
did
you
know
who
told
you
i
handed
him
the
he
threw
the
paper
down
and
said
i
care
a
button
for
that
i
expected
that
but
i
did
not
expect
he
then
read
a
letter
from
frank
mutlar
announcing
in
a
cool
manner
that
daisy
mutlar
is
to
be
married
next
month
to
murray
posh
i
exclaimed
posh
is
not
that
the
very
man
frank
had
the
impudence
to
bring
here
last
tuesday
week
lupin
said
the
we
all
then
ate
our
breakfast
in
dead
silence
in
fact
i
could
eat
nothing
i
was
not
only
too
worried
but
i
can
not
and
will
not
eat
cushion
of
bacon
if
i
can
not
get
streaky
bacon
i
will
do
without
anything
when
lupin
rose
to
go
i
noticed
a
malicious
smile
creep
over
his
face
i
asked
him
what
it
meant
he
replied
only
a
little
it
is
a
consolation
i
have
just
remembered
that
by
advice
murray
posh
has
invested
in
parachikka
chlorates
chapter
xvii
marriage
of
daisy
mutlar
and
murray
posh
the
dream
of
my
life
realised
perkupp
takes
lupin
into
the
office
march
being
the
day
on
which
daisy
mutlar
and
murray
posh
are
to
be
married
lupin
has
gone
with
a
friend
to
spend
the
day
at
gravesend
lupin
has
been
much
over
the
affair
although
he
declares
that
he
is
glad
it
is
off
i
wish
he
would
not
go
to
so
many
but
one
dare
not
say
anything
to
him
about
it
at
the
present
moment
he
irritates
me
by
singing
all
over
the
house
some
nonsense
about
the
matter
with
gladstone
all
right
the
matter
with
lupin
all
right
think
either
of
them
is
in
the
evening
gowing
called
and
the
chief
topic
of
conversation
was
marriage
to
murray
posh
i
said
was
glad
the
matter
was
at
an
end
as
daisy
would
only
have
made
a
fool
of
gowing
with
his
usual
good
taste
said
master
lupin
can
make
a
fool
of
himself
without
any
carrie
very
properly
resented
this
and
gowing
had
sufficient
sense
to
say
he
was
sorry
march
i
shall
conclude
my
diary
for
it
is
one
of
the
happiest
days
of
my
life
my
great
dream
of
the
last
few
fact
of
many
been
realised
this
morning
came
a
letter
from
perkupp
asking
me
to
take
lupin
down
to
the
office
with
me
i
went
to
room
poor
fellow
he
seemed
very
pale
and
said
he
had
a
bad
headache
he
had
come
back
yesterday
from
gravesend
where
he
spent
part
of
the
day
in
a
small
boat
on
the
water
having
been
mad
enough
to
neglect
to
take
his
overcoat
with
him
i
showed
him
letter
and
he
got
up
as
quickly
as
possible
i
begged
of
him
not
to
put
on
his
clothes
and
ties
but
to
dress
in
something
black
or
carrie
was
all
of
a
tremble
when
she
read
the
letter
and
all
she
could
keep
on
saying
was
i
hope
it
will
be
all
for
myself
i
could
scarcely
eat
any
breakfast
lupin
came
down
dressed
quietly
and
looking
a
perfect
gentleman
except
that
his
face
was
rather
yellow
carrie
by
way
of
encouragement
said
do
look
nice
lupin
replied
a
good
it
a
he
laughed
rather
ironically
in
the
hall
i
heard
a
great
noise
and
also
lupin
shouting
to
sarah
to
fetch
down
his
old
hat
i
went
into
the
passage
and
found
lupin
in
a
fury
kicking
and
smashing
a
new
tall
hat
i
said
my
boy
what
are
you
doing
how
wicked
of
you
some
poor
fellow
would
be
glad
to
have
lupin
replied
would
not
insult
any
poor
fellow
by
giving
it
to
when
he
had
gone
outside
i
picked
up
the
battered
hat
and
saw
inside
poor
lupin
i
can
forgive
him
it
seemed
hours
before
we
reached
the
office
perkupp
sent
for
lupin
who
was
with
him
nearly
an
hour
he
returned
as
i
thought
crestfallen
in
appearance
i
said
lupin
how
about
perkupp
lupin
commenced
his
song
the
matter
with
perkupp
all
right
i
felt
instinctively
my
boy
was
engaged
i
went
to
perkupp
but
i
could
not
speak
he
said
pooter
what
is
it
i
must
have
looked
a
fool
for
all
i
could
say
was
perkupp
you
are
a
good
he
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
and
said
pooter
are
the
good
man
and
see
if
we
can
not
get
your
son
to
follow
such
an
excellent
i
said
perkupp
may
i
go
home
i
can
not
work
any
more
my
good
master
shook
my
hand
warmly
as
he
nodded
his
head
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
prevent
myself
from
crying
in
the
in
fact
i
should
have
done
so
had
my
thoughts
not
been
interrupted
by
lupin
who
was
having
a
quarrel
with
a
fat
man
in
the
whom
he

round

lay
awake

hours

in
the

office
as
can
go

together
by
the
come

who

in

he
may
take
great
interest
in
our
little

he
may

over

chapter

trouble
with
a
stylographic
pen
we
go
to
a
volunteer
ball
where
i
am
let
in
for
an
expensive
supper
grossly
insulted
by
a
cabman
an
odd
invitation
to
southend
april
events
of
any
importance
except
that
gowing
strongly
recommended
a
new
patent
stylographic
pen
which
cost
me
and
which
was
simply
thrown
in
the
mud
it
has
caused
me
constant
annoyance
and
irritability
of
temper
the
ink
oozes
out
of
the
top
making
a
mess
on
my
hands
and
once
at
the
office
when
i
was
knocking
the
palm
of
my
hand
on
the
desk
to
jerk
the
ink
down
perkupp
who
had
just
entered
called
out
that
knocking
i
suppose
that
is
you
pitt
that
young
monkey
pitt
took
a
malicious
glee
in
responding
quite
loudly
sir
i
beg
pardon
it
is
pooter
with
his
pen
it
has
been
going
on
all
the
to
make
matters
worse
i
saw
lupin
laughing
behind
his
desk
i
thought
it
wiser
to
say
nothing
i
took
the
pen
back
to
the
shop
and
asked
them
if
they
would
take
it
back
as
it
did
not
act
i
did
not
expect
the
full
price
returned
but
was
willing
to
take
half
the
man
said
he
could
not
do
and
selling
were
two
different
things
conduct
during
the
period
he
has
been
in
office
has
been
most
exemplary
my
only
fear
is
it
is
too
good
to
last
april
called
bringing
with
him
an
invitation
for
carrie
and
myself
to
a
ball
given
by
the
east
acton
rifle
brigade
which
he
thought
would
be
a
swell
affair
as
the
member
for
east
acton
sir
william
grime
had
promised
his
patronage
we
accepted
of
his
kindness
and
he
stayed
to
supper
an
occasion
i
thought
suitable
for
trying
a
bottle
of
the
sparkling
algéra
that
james
of
sutton
had
sent
as
a
present
gowing
sipped
the
wine
observing
that
he
had
never
tasted
it
before
and
further
remarked
that
his
policy
was
to
stick
to
more
recognised
brands
i
told
him
it
was
a
present
from
a
dear
friend
and
one
look
a
in
the
mouth
gowing
facetiously
replied
he
like
putting
it
in
the
mouth
i
thought
the
remarks
were
rude
without
being
funny
but
on
tasting
it
myself
came
to
the
conclusion
there
was
some
justification
for
them
the
sparkling
algéra
is
very
like
cider
only
more
sour
i
suggested
that
perhaps
the
thunder
had
turned
it
a
bit
acid
he
merely
replied
i
think
we
had
a
very
pleasant
game
of
cards
though
i
lost
four
shillings
and
carrie
lost
one
and
gowing
said
he
had
lost
about
sixpence
how
he
could
have
lost
considering
that
carrie
and
i
were
the
only
other
players
remains
a
mystery
april
i
presume
to
the
unsettled
weather
i
awoke
with
a
feeling
that
my
skin
was
drawn
over
my
face
as
tight
as
a
drum
walking
round
the
garden
with
and
treane
members
of
our
congregation
who
had
walked
back
with
us
i
was
much
annoyed
to
find
a
large
newspaper
full
of
bones
on
the
evidently
thrown
over
by
those
young
griffin
boys
next
door
who
whenever
we
have
friends
climb
up
the
empty
steps
inside
their
conservatory
tap
at
the
windows
making
faces
whistling
and
imitating
birds
april
my
tongue
most
awfully
with
the
worcester
sauce
through
that
stupid
girl
sarah
shaking
the
bottle
violently
before
putting
it
on
the
table
april
night
of
the
east
acton
volunteer
ball
on
my
advice
carrie
put
on
the
same
dress
that
she
looked
so
beautiful
in
at
the
mansion
house
for
it
had
occurred
to
me
being
a
military
ball
that
perkupp
who
i
believe
is
an
officer
in
the
honorary
artillery
company
would
in
all
probability
be
present
lupin
in
his
usual
incomprehensible
language
remarked
that
he
had
heard
it
was
a
i
ask
him
what
he
meant
though
i
understand
where
he
gets
these
expressions
from
i
know
he
certainly
learn
them
at
home
the
invitation
was
for
eight
so
i
concluded
if
we
arrived
an
hour
later
we
should
be
in
good
time
without
being
as
james
says
it
was
very
difficult
to
cabman
having
to
get
down
several
times
to
inquire
at
different
where
the
drill
hall
was
i
wonder
at
people
living
in
such
places
no
one
seemed
to
know
it
however
after
going
up
and
down
a
good
many
streets
we
arrived
at
our
destination
i
had
no
idea
it
was
so
far
from
holloway
i
gave
the
cabman
five
shillings
who
only
grumbled
saying
it
was
dirt
cheap
at
and
was
impertinent
enough
to
advise
me
the
next
time
i
went
to
a
ball
to
take
a
captain
welcut
received
us
saying
we
were
rather
late
but
that
it
was
better
late
than
never
he
seemed
a
very
gentleman
though
as
carrie
remarked
short
for
an
he
begged
to
be
excused
for
leaving
us
as
he
was
engaged
for
a
dance
and
hoped
we
should
make
ourselves
at
home
carrie
took
my
arm
and
we
walked
round
the
rooms
two
or
three
times
and
watched
the
people
dancing
i
find
a
single
person
i
knew
but
attributed
it
to
most
of
them
being
in
uniform
as
we
were
entering
the
i
received
a
slap
on
the
shoulder
followed
by
a
welcome
shake
of
the
hand
i
said
padge
i
believe
he
replied
i
gave
carrie
a
chair
and
seated
by
her
was
a
lady
who
made
herself
at
home
with
carrie
at
once
there
was
a
very
liberal
repast
on
the
tables
plenty
of
champagne
claret
and
in
fact
everything
seemed
to
be
done
regardless
of
expense
padge
is
a
man
that
i
admit
i
have
no
particular
liking
for
but
i
felt
so
glad
to
come
across
someone
i
knew
that
i
asked
him
to
sit
at
our
table
and
i
must
say
that
for
a
short
fat
man
he
looked
well
in
uniform
although
i
think
his
tunic
was
rather
baggy
in
the
back
it
was
the
only
that
i
have
been
in
that
was
not
in
fact
we
were
the
only
people
there
everybody
being
so
busy
dancing
i
assisted
carrie
and
her
acquaintance
who
said
her
name
was
lupkin
to
some
champagne
also
myself
and
handed
the
bottle
to
padge
to
do
likewise
saying
must
look
after
he
replied
right
and
poured
out
half
a
tumbler
and
drank
health
coupled
as
he
said
her
worthy
lord
and
we
all
had
some
splendid
pigeon
pie
and
ices
to
follow
the
waiters
were
very
attentive
and
asked
if
we
would
like
some
more
wine
i
assisted
carrie
and
her
friend
and
padge
also
some
people
who
had
just
come
from
the
who
were
very
civil
it
occurred
to
me
at
the
time
that
perhaps
some
of
the
gentlemen
knew
me
in
the
city
as
they
were
so
polite
i
made
myself
useful
and
assisted
several
ladies
to
ices
remembering
an
old
saying
that
is
nothing
lost
by
the
band
struck
up
for
the
dance
and
they
all
went
into
the
the
ladies
carrie
and
lupkin
were
anxious
to
see
the
dancing
and
as
i
had
not
quite
finished
my
supper
padge
offered
his
arms
to
them
and
escorted
them
to
the
telling
me
to
follow
i
said
to
padge
is
quite
a
west
end
affair
to
which
remark
padge
replied
when
i
had
quite
finished
my
supper
and
was
leaving
the
waiter
who
had
been
attending
on
us
arrested
my
attention
by
tapping
me
on
the
shoulder
i
thought
it
unusual
for
a
waiter
at
a
private
ball
to
expect
a
tip
but
nevertheless
gave
a
shilling
as
he
had
been
very
attentive
he
smilingly
replied
beg
your
pardon
sir
this
is
no
good
alluding
to
the
shilling
had
four
suppers
at
a
head
five
ices
at
three
bottles
of
champagne
at
a
glass
of
claret
and
a
sixpenny
cigar
for
the
stout
all
i
think
i
was
ever
so
surprised
in
my
life
and
had
only
sufficient
breath
to
inform
him
that
i
had
received
a
private
invitation
to
which
he
answered
that
he
was
perfectly
well
aware
of
that
but
that
the
invitation
include
eatables
and
drinkables
a
gentleman
who
was
standing
at
the
bar
corroborated
the
statement
and
assured
me
it
was
quite
correct
the
waiter
said
he
was
extremely
sorry
if
i
had
been
under
any
misapprehension
but
it
was
not
his
fault
of
course
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
pay
so
after
turning
out
my
pockets
i
just
managed
to
scrape
up
sufficient
all
but
nine
shillings
but
the
manager
on
my
giving
my
card
to
him
said
all
i
think
i
ever
felt
more
humiliated
in
my
life
and
i
determined
to
keep
this
misfortune
from
carrie
for
it
would
entirely
destroy
the
pleasant
evening
she
was
enjoying
i
felt
there
was
no
more
enjoyment
for
me
that
evening
and
it
being
late
i
sought
carrie
and
lupkin
carrie
said
she
was
quite
ready
to
go
and
lupkin
as
we
were
wishing
her
asked
carrie
and
myself
if
we
ever
paid
a
visit
to
southend
on
my
replying
that
i
been
there
for
many
years
she
very
kindly
said
why
you
come
down
and
stay
at
our
place
as
her
invitation
was
so
pressing
and
observing
that
carrie
wished
to
go
we
promised
we
would
visit
her
the
next
saturday
week
and
stay
till
monday
lupkin
said
she
would
write
to
us
giving
us
the
address
and
particulars
of
trains
etc
when
we
got
outside
the
drill
hall
it
was
raining
so
hard
that
the
roads
resembled
canals
and
i
need
hardly
say
we
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
a
cabman
to
take
us
to
holloway
after
waiting
a
bit
a
man
said
he
would
drive
us
anyhow
as
far
as
angel
at
islington
and
we
could
easily
get
another
cab
from
there
it
was
a
tedious
journey
the
rain
was
beating
against
the
windows
and
trickling
down
the
inside
of
the
cab
when
we
arrived
at
the
horse
seemed
tired
out
carrie
got
out
and
ran
into
a
doorway
and
when
i
came
to
pay
to
my
absolute
horror
i
remembered
i
had
no
money
nor
had
carrie
i
explained
to
the
cabman
how
we
were
situated
never
in
my
life
have
i
ever
been
so
insulted
the
cabman
who
was
a
rough
bully
and
to
my
thinking
not
sober
called
me
every
name
he
could
lay
his
tongue
to
and
positively
seized
me
by
the
beard
which
he
pulled
till
the
tears
came
into
my
eyes
i
took
the
number
of
a
policeman
who
witnessed
the
assault
for
not
taking
the
man
in
charge
the
policeman
said
he
interfere
that
he
had
seen
no
assault
and
that
people
should
not
ride
in
cabs
without
money
we
had
to
walk
home
in
the
pouring
rain
nearly
two
miles
and
when
i
got
in
i
put
down
the
conversation
i
had
with
the
cabman
word
for
word
as
i
intend
writing
to
the
for
the
purpose
of
proposing
that
cabs
should
be
driven
only
by
men
under
government
control
to
prevent
civilians
being
subjected
to
the
disgraceful
insult
and
outrage
that
i
had
had
to
endure
april
water
in
our
cistern
again
sent
for
putley
who
said
he
would
soon
remedy
that
the
cistern
being
zinc
april
all
right
again
in
the
cistern
james
of
sutton
called
in
the
afternoon
she
and
carrie
draped
the
mantelpiece
in
the
and
put
little
toy
spiders
frogs
and
beetles
all
over
it
as
james
says
quite
the
fashion
it
was
suggestion
and
of
course
carrie
always
does
what
james
suggests
for
my
part
i
preferred
the
mantelpiece
as
it
was
but
there
a
plain
man
and
pretend
to
be
in
the
fashion
april
neighbour
griffin
called
and
in
a
rather
offensive
tone
accused
me
or
of
boring
a
hole
in
his
cistern
and
letting
out
his
water
to
supply
our
cistern
which
adjoined
his
he
said
he
should
have
his
repaired
and
send
us
in
the
bill
april
called
hobbling
in
with
a
stick
saying
he
had
been
on
his
back
for
a
week
it
appears
he
was
trying
to
shut
his
bedroom
door
which
is
situated
just
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
and
unknown
to
him
a
piece
of
cork
the
dog
had
been
playing
with
had
got
between
the
door
and
prevented
it
shutting
and
in
pulling
the
door
hard
to
give
it
an
extra
slam
the
handle
came
off
in
his
hands
and
he
fell
backwards
downstairs
on
hearing
this
lupin
suddenly
jumped
up
from
the
couch
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
sideways
cummings
looked
very
indignant
and
remarked
it
was
very
poor
fun
a
man
nearly
breaking
his
back
and
though
i
had
my
suspicions
that
lupin
was
laughing
i
assured
cummings
that
he
had
only
run
out
to
open
the
door
to
a
friend
he
expected
cummings
said
this
was
the
second
time
he
had
been
laid
up
and
we
had
never
sent
to
inquire
i
said
i
knew
nothing
about
it
cummings
said
was
mentioned
in
the
april
have
of
late
frequently
noticed
carrie
rubbing
her
nails
a
good
deal
with
an
instrument
and
on
asking
her
what
she
was
doing
she
replied
going
in
for
manicuring
all
the
fashion
i
said
suppose
james
introduced
that
into
your
carrie
laughingly
replied
but
everyone
does
it
i
wish
james
come
to
the
house
whenever
she
does
she
always
introduces
some
rubbish
into
head
one
of
these
days
i
feel
sure
i
shall
tell
her
not
welcome
i
am
sure
it
was
james
who
put
carrie
up
to
writing
on
dark
paper
with
white
ink
nonsense
april
a
letter
from
lupkin
of
southend
telling
us
the
train
to
come
by
on
saturday
and
hoping
we
will
keep
our
promise
to
stay
with
her
the
letter
concluded
must
come
and
stay
at
our
house
we
shall
charge
you
half
what
you
will
have
to
pay
at
the
royal
and
the
view
is
every
bit
as
looking
at
the
address
at
the
top
of
the
i
found
it
was
family
and
commercial
i
wrote
a
note
saying
we
were
compelled
to
her
kind
carrie
thought
this
very
satirical
and
to
the
point
i
will
never
choose
another
cloth
pattern
at
night
i
ordered
a
new
suit
of
dittos
for
the
garden
at
and
chose
the
pattern
by
gaslight
and
they
seemed
to
be
a
quiet
mixture
with
white
stripes
down
they
came
home
this
morning
and
to
my
horror
i
found
it
was
quite
a
suit
there
was
a
lot
of
green
with
bright
stripes
i
tried
on
the
coat
and
was
annoyed
to
find
carrie
giggling
she
said
mixture
did
you
say
you
asked
for
i
said
quiet
pepper
and
carrie
said
it
looks
more
like
mustard

on
dreams
april
a
little
later
than
usual
at
the
office
and
as
i
was
hurrying
along
a
man
stopped
me
saying
a
face
i
i
replied
politely
likely
lots
of
people
know
me
although
i
may
not
know
he
replied
you
know
so
it
was
he
was
at
the
same
school
with
me
i
had
not
seen
him
for
years
and
years
no
wonder
i
did
not
know
him
at
school
he
was
at
least
a
head
taller
than
i
was
now
i
am
at
least
a
head
taller
than
he
is
and
he
has
a
thick
beard
almost
grey
he
insisted
on
my
having
a
glass
of
wine
a
thing
i
never
do
and
told
me
he
lived
at
where
he
was
deputy
town
clerk
a
position
which
was
as
high
as
the
town
clerk
of
fact
higher
he
added
that
he
was
staying
for
a
few
days
in
london
with
his
uncle
edgar
paul
finsworth
of
finsworth
and
pultwell
he
said
he
was
sure
his
uncle
would
be
only
too
pleased
to
see
me
and
he
had
a
nice
house
watney
lodge
only
a
few
walk
from
muswell
hill
station
i
gave
him
our
address
and
we
parted
in
the
evening
to
my
surprise
he
called
with
a
very
nice
letter
from
finsworth
saying
if
we
including
carrie
would
dine
with
them
sunday
at
two
he
would
be
delighted
carrie
did
not
like
to
go
but
teddy
finsworth
pressed
us
so
much
we
consented
carrie
sent
sarah
round
to
the
and
countermanded
our
of
mutton
which
we
had
ordered
for
april
found
watney
lodge
farther
off
than
we
anticipated
and
only
arrived
as
the
clock
struck
two
both
feeling
hot
and
uncomfortable
to
make
matters
worse
a
large
collie
dog
pounced
forward
to
receive
us
he
barked
loudly
and
jumped
up
at
carrie
covering
her
light
skirt
which
she
was
wearing
for
the
first
time
with
mud
teddy
finsworth
came
out
and
drove
the
dog
off
and
apologised
we
were
shown
into
the
which
was
beautifully
decorated
it
was
full
of
and
some
plates
hung
up
on
the
wall
there
were
several
little
wooden
with
paintings
on
them
also
a
white
wooden
banjo
painted
by
one
of
paul
cousin
of
paul
finsworth
seemed
quite
a
elderly
gentleman
and
was
most
gallant
to
carrie
there
were
a
great
many
hanging
on
the
walls
mostly
different
views
of
india
which
were
very
bright
finsworth
said
they
were
painted
by
and
added
that
he
was
no
judge
of
pictures
himself
but
had
been
informed
on
good
authority
that
they
were
worth
some
hundreds
of
pounds
although
he
had
only
paid
a
few
shillings
apiece
for
them
frames
included
at
a
sale
in
the
neighbourhood
there
was
also
a
large
picture
in
a
very
handsome
frame
done
in
coloured
crayons
it
looked
like
a
religious
subject
i
was
very
much
struck
with
the
lace
collar
it
looked
so
real
but
i
unfortunately
made
the
remark
that
there
was
something
about
the
expression
of
the
face
that
was
not
quite
pleasing
it
looked
pinched
finsworth
sorrowfully
replied
the
face
was
done
after
i
felt
terribly
awkward
and
bowed
apologetically
and
in
a
whisper
said
i
hoped
i
had
not
hurt
his
feelings
we
both
stood
looking
at
the
picture
for
a
few
minutes
in
silence
when
finsworth
took
out
a
handkerchief
and
said
was
sitting
in
our
garden
last
summer
and
blew
his
nose
violently
he
seemed
quite
affected
so
i
turned
to
look
at
something
else
and
stood
in
front
of
a
portrait
of
a
gentleman
with
a
red
face
and
straw
hat
i
said
to
finsworth
is
this
gentleman
life
seem
to
trouble
him
finsworth
said
it
is
dead
i
was
absolutely
horrified
at
my
own
awkwardness
fortunately
at
this
moment
carrie
entered
with
finsworth
who
had
taken
her
upstairs
to
take
off
her
bonnet
and
brush
her
skirt
teddy
said
is
late
but
at
that
moment
the
gentleman
referred
to
arrived
and
i
was
introduced
to
him
by
teddy
who
said
you
know
short
i
replied
smiling
that
i
had
not
that
pleasure
but
i
hoped
it
would
not
be
long
before
i
knew
he
evidently
did
not
see
my
little
joke
although
i
repeated
it
twice
with
a
little
laugh
i
suddenly
remembered
it
was
sunday
and
short
was
perhaps
in
this
i
was
mistaken
for
he
was
not
at
all
particular
in
several
of
his
remarks
after
dinner
in
fact
i
was
so
ashamed
of
one
of
his
observations
that
i
took
the
opportunity
to
say
to
finsworth
that
i
feared
she
found
short
occasionally
a
little
embarrassing
to
my
surprise
she
said
he
is
privileged
you
i
did
not
know
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
so
i
bowed
apologetically
i
fail
to
see
why
short
should
be
privileged
another
thing
that
annoyed
me
at
dinner
was
that
the
collie
dog
which
jumped
up
at
carrie
was
allowed
to
remain
under
the
table
it
kept
growling
and
snapping
at
my
boots
every
time
i
moved
my
foot
feeling
nervous
rather
i
spoke
to
finsworth
about
the
animal
and
she
remarked
is
only
his
she
jumped
up
and
let
in
a
frightfully
spaniel
called
bibbs
which
had
been
scratching
at
the
door
this
dog
also
seemed
to
take
a
fancy
to
my
boots
and
i
discovered
afterwards
that
it
had
licked
off
every
bit
of
blacking
from
them
i
was
positively
ashamed
of
being
seen
in
them
finsworth
who
i
must
say
is
not
much
of
a
comforter
said
we
are
used
to
bibbs
doing
that
to
our
finsworth
had
up
some
fine
port
although
i
question
whether
it
is
a
good
thing
to
take
on
the
top
of
beer
it
made
me
feel
a
little
sleepy
while
it
had
the
effect
of
inducing
short
to
become
to
rather
an
alarming
extent
it
being
cold
even
for
april
there
was
a
fire
in
the
we
sat
round
in
and
teddy
and
i
waxed
rather
eloquent
over
the
old
school
days
which
had
the
effect
of
sending
all
the
others
to
sleep
i
was
delighted
as
far
as
short
was
concerned
that
it
did
have
that
effect
on
him
we
stayed
till
four
and
the
walk
home
was
remarkable
only
for
the
fact
that
several
fools
giggled
at
the
unpolished
state
of
my
boots
polished
them
myself
when
i
got
home
went
to
church
in
the
evening
and
could
scarcely
keep
awake
i
will
not
take
port
on
the
top
of
beer
again
april
am
getting
quite
accustomed
to
being
snubbed
by
lupin
and
i
do
not
mind
being
sat
upon
by
carrie
because
i
think
she
has
a
certain
amount
of
right
to
do
so
but
i
do
think
it
hard
to
be
at
once
snubbed
by
wife
son
and
both
my
guests
gowing
and
cummings
had
dropped
in
during
the
evening
and
i
suddenly
remembered
an
extraordinary
dream
i
had
a
few
nights
ago
and
i
thought
i
would
tell
them
about
it
i
dreamt
i
saw
some
huge
blocks
of
ice
in
a
shop
with
a
bright
glare
behind
them
i
walked
into
the
shop
and
the
heat
was
overpowering
i
found
that
the
blocks
of
ice
were
on
fire
the
whole
thing
was
so
real
and
yet
so
supernatural
i
woke
up
in
a
cold
perspiration
lupin
in
a
most
contemptuous
manner
said
utter
before
i
could
reply
gowing
said
there
was
nothing
so
completely
uninteresting
as
other
dreams
i
appealed
to
cummings
but
he
said
he
was
bound
to
agree
with
the
others
and
my
dream
was
especially
nonsensical
i
said
seemed
so
real
to
gowing
replied
to
perhaps
but
not
to
whereupon
they
all
roared
carrie
who
had
hitherto
been
quiet
said
tells
me
his
stupid
dreams
every
morning
i
replied
well
dear
i
promise
you
i
will
never
tell
you
or
anybody
else
another
dream
of
mine
the
longest
day
i
lupin
said
hear
and
helped
himself
to
another
glass
of
beer
the
subject
was
fortunately
changed
and
cummings
read
a
most
interesting
article
on
the
superiority
of
the
bicycle
to
the
horse
chapter
xx
dinner
at
to
meet
hardfur
huttle
may
a
letter
from
franching
of
peckham
asking
us
to
dine
with
him
at
seven
to
meet
hardfur
huttle
a
very
clever
writer
for
the
american
papers
franching
apologised
for
the
short
notice
but
said
he
had
at
the
last
moment
been
disappointed
of
two
of
his
guests
and
regarded
us
as
old
friends
who
would
not
mind
filling
up
the
gap
carrie
rather
demurred
at
the
invitation
but
i
explained
to
her
that
franching
was
very
well
off
and
influential
and
we
could
not
afford
to
offend
him
we
are
sure
to
get
a
good
dinner
and
a
good
glass
of
never
agrees
with
you
carrie
replied
sharply
i
regarded
observation
as
unsaid
franching
asked
us
to
wire
a
reply
as
he
had
said
nothing
about
dress
in
the
letter
i
wired
back
pleasure
is
it
full
dress
and
by
leaving
out
our
name
just
got
the
message
within
the
sixpence
got
back
early
to
give
time
to
dress
which
we
received
a
telegram
instructing
us
to
do
i
wanted
carrie
to
meet
me
at
house
but
she
would
not
do
so
so
i
had
to
go
home
to
fetch
her
what
a
long
journey
it
is
from
holloway
to
peckham
why
do
people
live
such
a
long
way
off
having
to
change
i
allowed
plenty
of
fact
too
much
for
we
arrived
at
twenty
minutes
to
seven
and
franching
so
the
servant
said
had
only
just
gone
up
to
dress
however
he
was
down
as
the
clock
struck
seven
he
must
have
dressed
very
quickly
i
must
say
it
was
quite
a
distinguished
party
and
although
we
did
not
know
anybody
personally
they
all
seemed
to
be
quite
swells
franching
had
got
a
professional
waiter
and
evidently
spared
no
expense
there
were
flowers
on
the
table
round
some
and
the
effect
i
must
say
was
exquisite
the
wine
was
good
and
there
was
plenty
of
champagne
concerning
which
franching
said
he
himself
never
wished
to
taste
better
we
were
ten
in
number
and
a
card
to
each
one
lady
said
she
always
preserved
the
and
got
the
guests
to
write
their
names
on
the
back
we
all
of
us
followed
her
example
except
huttle
who
was
of
course
the
important
guest
the
consisted
of
franching
hardfur
huttle
and
samuel
hillbutter
field
and
purdick
pratt
kent
and
last
but
not
least
and
charles
pooter
franching
said
he
was
sorry
he
had
no
lady
for
me
to
take
in
to
dinner
i
replied
that
i
preferred
it
which
i
afterwards
thought
was
a
very
uncomplimentary
observation
to
make
i
sat
next
to
field
at
dinner
she
seemed
a
lady
but
was
very
deaf
it
did
not
much
matter
for
hardfur
huttle
did
all
the
talking
he
is
a
marvellously
intellectual
man
and
says
things
which
from
other
people
would
seem
quite
alarming
how
i
wish
i
could
remember
even
a
quarter
of
his
brilliant
conversation
i
made
a
few
little
reminding
notes
on
the
card
one
observation
struck
me
as
being
absolutely
not
to
my
way
of
thinking
of
course
purdick
happened
to
say
are
certainly
unorthodox
huttle
with
a
peculiar
expression
i
can
see
it
now
said
in
a
slow
rich
voice
purdick
is
a
grandiloquent
word
implying
if
columbus
and
stephenson
had
been
orthodox
there
would
neither
have
been
the
discovery
of
america
nor
the
there
was
quite
a
silence
it
appeared
to
me
that
such
teaching
was
absolutely
dangerous
and
yet
i
fact
we
must
all
have
was
no
answer
to
the
argument
a
little
later
on
purdick
who
is
sister
and
also
acted
as
hostess
rose
from
the
table
and
huttle
said
ladies
do
you
deprive
us
of
your
company
so
soon
why
not
wait
while
we
have
our
cigars
the
effect
was
electrical
the
ladies
including
carrie
were
in
no
way
inclined
to
be
deprived
of
fascinating
society
and
immediately
resumed
their
seats
amid
much
laughter
and
a
little
chaff
huttle
said
a
real
good
sign
you
shall
not
be
insulted
by
being
called
orthodox
any
purdick
who
seemed
to
be
a
bright
and
rather
sharp
woman
said
huttle
we
will
meet
you
is
till
you
get
through
your
cigar
that
at
all
events
will
be
the
happy
i
shall
never
forget
the
effect
the
words
medium
had
upon
him
he
was
brilliant
and
most
daring
in
his
interpretation
of
the
words
he
positively
alarmed
me
he
said
something
like
the
following
medium
indeed
do
you
know
are
two
words
which
mean
i
say
go
first
class
or
third
marry
a
duchess
or
her
kitchenmaid
the
happy
medium
means
respectability
and
respectability
means
insipidness
does
it
not
pooter
i
was
so
taken
aback
by
being
personally
appealed
to
that
i
could
only
bow
apologetically
and
say
i
feared
i
was
not
competent
to
offer
an
opinion
carrie
was
about
to
say
something
but
she
was
interrupted
for
which
i
was
rather
pleased
for
she
is
not
clever
at
argument
and
one
has
to
be
extra
clever
to
discuss
a
subject
with
a
man
like
huttle
he
continued
with
an
amazing
eloquence
that
made
his
unwelcome
opinions
positively
convincing
happy
medium
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
vulgar
a
man
who
loves
champagne
and
finding
a
pint
too
little
fears
to
face
a
whole
bottle
and
has
recourse
to
an
imperial
pint
will
never
build
a
brooklyn
bridge
or
an
eiffel
tower
no
he
is
he
is
a
fact
a
happy
medium
and
will
spend
the
rest
of
his
days
in
a
suburban
villa
with
a
portico
resembling
a
we
all
laughed
sort
of
thing
continued
huttle
to
a
soft
man
with
a
soft
beard
with
a
soft
head
with
a
made
tie
that
hooks
this
seemed
rather
personal
and
twice
i
caught
myself
looking
in
the
glass
of
the
cheffonière
for
had
on
a
tie
that
hooked
why
not
if
these
remarks
were
not
personal
they
were
rather
careless
and
so
were
some
of
his
subsequent
observations
which
must
have
made
both
franching
and
his
guests
rather
uncomfortable
i
think
huttle
meant
to
be
personal
for
he
added
know
that
class
here
in
this
country
but
we
do
in
america
and
no
use
for
franching
several
times
suggested
that
the
wine
should
be
passed
round
the
table
which
huttle
did
not
heed
but
continued
as
if
he
were
giving
a
lecture
we
want
in
america
is
your
homes
we
live
on
wheels
your
simple
quiet
life
and
home
franching
are
charming
no
display
no
pretension
you
make
no
difference
in
your
dinner
i
dare
say
when
you
sit
down
by
yourself
and
when
you
invite
us
you
have
your
own
personal
hired
waiter
to
breathe
on
the
back
of
your
i
saw
franching
palpably
wince
at
this
huttle
continued
a
small
dinner
with
a
few
good
things
such
as
you
have
this
evening
you
insult
your
guests
by
sending
to
the
grocer
for
champagne
at
six
shillings
a
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
at
fact
said
huttle
man
is
little
less
than
a
murderer
who
does
that
is
the
province
of
the
milksop
who
wastes
his
evening
at
home
playing
dominoes
with
his
wife
heard
of
these
people
we
want
them
at
this
table
our
party
is
well
selected
no
use
for
deaf
old
women
who
can
not
follow
intellectual
all
our
eyes
were
turned
to
field
who
fortunately
being
deaf
did
not
hear
his
remarks
but
continued
smiling
approval
have
no
representative
at
table
said
huttle
the
unenlightened
frivolous
matron
who
goes
to
a
second
class
dance
at
bayswater
and
fancies
she
is
in
society
society
does
not
know
her
it
has
no
use
for
huttle
paused
for
a
moment
and
the
opportunity
was
afforded
for
the
ladies
to
rise
i
asked
franching
quietly
to
excuse
me
as
i
did
not
wish
to
miss
the
last
train
which
we
very
nearly
did
through
carrie
having
mislaid
the
little
cloth
which
she
wears
when
we
go
out
it
was
very
late
when
carrie
and
i
got
home
but
on
entering
the
i
said
what
do
you
think
of
hardfur
huttle
she
simply
answered
like
lupin
the
same
idea
occurred
to
me
in
the
train
the
comparison
kept
me
awake
half
the
night
huttle
was
of
course
an
older
and
more
influential
man
but
he
like
lupin
and
it
made
me
think
how
dangerous
lupin
would
be
if
he
were
older
and
more
influential
i
feel
proud
to
think
lupin
resemble
huttle
in
some
ways
lupin
like
huttle
has
original
and
sometimes
wonderful
ideas
but
it
is
those
ideas
that
are
so
dangerous
they
make
men
extremely
rich
or
extremely
poor
they
make
or
break
men
i
always
feel
people
are
happier
who
live
a
simple
unsophisticated
life
i
believe
am
happy
because
i
am
not
ambitious
somehow
i
feel
that
lupin
since
he
has
been
with
perkupp
has
become
content
to
settle
down
and
follow
the
footsteps
of
his
father
this
is
a
comfort
chapter
xxi
lupin
is
discharged
we
are
in
great
trouble
lupin
gets
engaged
elsewhere
at
a
handsome
salary
may
terrible
misfortune
has
happened
lupin
is
discharged
from
office
and
i
scarcely
know
how
i
am
writing
my
diary
i
was
away
from
office
last
the
first
time
i
have
been
absent
through
illness
for
twenty
years
i
believe
i
was
poisoned
by
some
lobster
perkupp
was
also
absent
as
fate
would
have
it
and
our
most
valued
customer
crowbillon
went
to
the
office
in
a
rage
and
withdrew
his
custom
my
boy
lupin
not
only
had
the
assurance
to
receive
him
but
recommended
him
the
firm
of
gylterson
sons
and
limited
in
my
own
humble
judgment
and
though
i
have
to
say
it
against
my
own
son
this
seems
an
act
of
treachery
this
morning
i
receive
a
letter
from
perkupp
informing
me
that
services
are
no
longer
required
and
an
interview
with
me
is
desired
at
eleven
i
went
down
to
the
office
with
an
aching
heart
dreading
an
interview
with
perkupp
with
whom
i
have
never
had
a
word
i
saw
nothing
of
lupin
in
the
morning
he
had
not
got
up
when
it
was
time
for
me
to
leave
and
carrie
said
i
should
do
no
good
by
disturbing
him
my
mind
wandered
so
at
the
office
that
i
could
not
do
my
work
properly
as
i
expected
i
was
sent
for
by
perkupp
and
the
following
conversation
ensued
as
nearly
as
i
can
remember
it
perkupp
said
pooter
this
is
a
very
serious
business
i
am
not
referring
so
much
to
the
dismissal
of
your
son
for
i
knew
we
should
have
to
part
sooner
or
later
am
the
head
of
this
old
influential
and
firm
and
when
consider
the
time
has
come
to
revolutionise
the
business
will
do
it
i
could
see
my
good
master
was
somewhat
affected
and
i
said
hope
sir
you
do
not
imagine
that
i
have
in
any
way
countenanced
my
unwarrantable
interference
perkupp
rose
from
his
seat
and
took
my
hand
and
said
pooter
i
would
as
soon
suspect
myself
as
suspect
i
was
so
agitated
that
in
the
confusion
to
show
my
gratitude
i
very
nearly
called
him
a
old
fortunately
i
checked
myself
in
time
and
said
he
was
a
old
i
was
so
unaccountable
for
my
actions
that
i
sat
down
leaving
him
standing
of
course
i
at
once
rose
but
perkupp
bade
me
sit
down
which
i
was
very
pleased
to
do
perkupp
resuming
said
will
understand
pooter
that
the
nature
of
our
firm
will
not
admit
of
our
bending
to
anybody
if
crowbillon
chooses
to
put
his
work
into
other
may
add
less
experienced
is
not
for
us
to
bend
and
beg
back
his
not
do
it
sir
i
said
with
indignation
replied
perkupp
shall
do
it
but
i
was
thinking
this
pooter
crowbillon
is
our
most
valued
client
and
i
will
even
i
know
this
will
not
go
beyond
we
can
not
afford
very
well
to
lose
him
especially
in
these
times
which
are
not
of
the
brightest
now
i
fancy
you
can
be
of
i
replied
perkupp
i
will
work
day
and
night
to
serve
you
perkupp
said
know
you
will
now
what
i
should
like
you
to
do
is
this
you
yourself
might
write
to
must
not
of
course
lead
him
to
suppose
i
know
anything
about
your
doing
explain
to
him
that
your
son
was
only
taken
on
as
a
an
inexperienced
one
in
of
the
respect
the
firm
had
for
you
pooter
this
is
of
course
a
fact
i
suggest
that
you
should
speak
in
too
strong
terms
of
your
own
conduct
but
i
may
add
that
had
he
been
a
son
of
mine
i
should
have
condemned
his
interference
with
no
measured
terms
that
i
leave
to
you
i
think
the
result
will
be
that
crowbillon
will
see
the
force
of
the
foolish
step
he
has
taken
and
our
firm
will
neither
suffer
in
dignity
nor
in
i
could
not
help
thinking
what
a
noble
gentleman
perkupp
is
his
manners
and
his
way
of
speaking
seem
to
almost
thrill
one
with
respect
i
said
you
like
to
see
the
letter
before
i
send
it
perkupp
said
no
i
had
better
not
i
am
supposed
to
know
nothing
about
it
and
i
have
every
confidence
in
you
you
must
write
the
letter
carefully
we
are
not
very
busy
you
had
better
take
the
morning
or
the
whole
day
if
you
like
i
shall
be
here
myself
all
day
in
fact
all
the
week
in
case
crowbillon
should
i
went
home
a
little
more
cheerful
but
i
left
word
with
sarah
that
i
could
not
see
either
gowing
or
cummings
nor
in
fact
anybody
if
they
called
in
the
evening
lupin
came
into
the
parlour
for
a
moment
with
a
new
hat
on
and
asked
my
opinion
of
it
i
said
i
was
not
in
the
mood
to
judge
of
hats
and
i
did
not
think
he
was
in
a
position
to
buy
a
new
one
lupin
replied
carelessly
buy
it
it
was
a
i
have
such
terrible
suspicions
of
lupin
now
that
i
scarcely
like
to
ask
him
questions
as
i
dread
the
answers
so
he
however
saved
me
the
trouble
he
said
met
a
friend
an
old
friend
that
i
did
not
quite
think
a
friend
at
the
time
but
all
right
as
he
wisely
said
is
fair
in
love
and
war
and
there
was
no
reason
why
we
should
not
be
friends
still
a
jolly
good
sort
of
fellow
and
a
very
different
stamp
from
that
inflated
fool
of
a
i
said
lupin
do
not
pray
add
insult
to
lupin
said
do
you
mean
by
injury
i
repeat
i
have
done
no
injury
crowbillon
is
simply
tired
of
a
stagnant
firm
and
made
the
change
on
his
own
account
i
simply
recommended
the
new
firm
as
a
matter
of
old
biz
i
said
quietly
understand
your
slang
and
at
my
time
of
life
have
no
desire
to
learn
it
so
lupin
my
boy
let
us
change
the
subject
i
will
if
it
please
you
and
be
interested
in
your
new
hat
lupin
said
nothing
much
about
it
except
i
have
not
once
seen
him
since
his
marriage
and
he
said
he
was
very
pleased
to
see
me
and
hoped
we
should
be
friends
i
stood
a
drink
to
cement
the
friendship
and
he
stood
me
a
new
of
his
i
said
rather
wearily
you
have
not
told
me
your
old
name
lupin
said
with
affected
carelessness
i
well
i
will
it
was
may
came
down
late
and
seeing
me
at
home
all
the
morning
asked
the
reason
of
it
carrie
and
i
both
agreed
it
was
better
to
say
nothing
to
him
about
the
letter
i
was
writing
so
i
evaded
the
question
lupin
went
out
saying
he
was
going
to
lunch
with
murray
posh
in
the
city
i
said
i
hoped
posh
would
provide
him
with
a
berth
lupin
went
out
laughing
saying
mind
hats
but
i
am
not
going
to
poor
boy
i
fear
he
is
perfectly
hopeless
it
took
me
nearly
the
whole
day
to
write
to
crowbillon
once
or
twice
i
asked
carrie
for
suggestions
and
although
it
seems
ungrateful
her
suggestions
were
none
of
them
to
the
point
while
one
or
two
were
absolutely
idiotic
of
course
i
did
not
tell
her
so
i
got
the
letter
off
and
took
it
down
to
the
office
for
perkupp
to
see
but
he
again
repeated
that
he
could
trust
me
gowing
called
in
the
evening
and
i
was
obliged
to
tell
him
about
lupin
and
perkupp
and
to
my
surprise
he
was
quite
inclined
to
side
with
lupin
carrie
joined
in
and
said
she
thought
i
was
taking
much
too
melancholy
a
view
of
it
gowing
produced
a
pint
of
madeira
which
had
been
given
him
which
he
said
would
get
rid
of
the
blues
i
dare
say
it
would
have
done
so
if
there
had
been
more
of
it
but
as
gowing
helped
himself
to
three
glasses
it
did
not
leave
much
for
carrie
and
me
to
get
rid
of
the
blues
with
may
day
of
great
anxiety
for
i
expected
every
moment
a
letter
from
crowbillon
two
letters
came
in
the
for
me
with
printed
in
large
letters
on
the
back
of
the
envelope
the
other
for
lupin
which
i
felt
inclined
to
open
and
read
as
it
had
sons
and
limited
which
was
the
recommended
firm
i
trembled
as
i
opened
letter
i
wrote
him
sixteen
pages
closely
written
he
wrote
me
less
than
sixteen
lines
his
letter
was
totally
disagree
with
you
your
son
in
the
course
of
five
conversation
displayed
more
intelligence
than
your
firm
has
done
during
the
last
five
faithfully
gilbert
gillam
what
am
i
to
do
here
is
a
letter
that
i
dare
not
show
to
perkupp
and
would
not
show
to
lupin
for
anything
the
crisis
had
yet
to
come
for
lupin
arrived
and
opening
his
letter
showed
a
cheque
for
as
a
commission
for
the
recommendation
of
crowbillon
whose
custom
to
perkupp
is
evidently
lost
for
ever
cummings
and
gowing
both
called
and
both
took
part
cummings
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
lupin
would
make
a
name
yet
i
suppose
i
was
melancholy
for
i
could
only
ask
but
what
sort
of
a
name
may
told
perkupp
the
contents
of
the
letter
in
a
modified
form
but
perkupp
said
discuss
the
matter
it
is
at
an
end
your
son
will
bring
his
punishment
upon
i
went
home
in
the
evening
thinking
of
the
hopeless
future
of
lupin
i
found
him
in
most
extravagant
spirits
and
in
evening
dress
he
threw
a
letter
on
the
table
for
me
to
read
to
my
amazement
i
read
that
gylterson
and
sons
had
absolutely
engaged
lupin
at
a
salary
of
a
year
with
other
advantages
i
read
the
letter
through
three
times
and
thought
it
must
have
been
for
me
but
there
it
enough
i
was
silent
lupin
said
price
perkupp
now
you
take
my
tip
with
perkupp
and
freeze
on
to
gylterson
the
firm
of
the
future
firm
the
stagnant
dummies
have
been
standing
still
for
years
and
now
are
moving
back
i
want
to
go
on
in
fact
i
must
go
as
i
am
dining
with
the
murray
poshs
in
the
exuberance
of
his
spirits
he
hit
his
hat
with
his
stick
gave
a
loud
war
jumped
over
a
chair
and
took
the
liberty
of
rumpling
my
hair
all
over
my
forehead
and
bounced
out
of
the
room
giving
me
no
chance
of
reminding
him
of
his
age
and
the
respect
which
was
due
to
his
parent
gowing
and
cummings
came
in
the
evening
and
positively
cheered
me
up
with
congratulations
respecting
lupin
gowing
said
always
said
he
would
get
on
and
take
my
word
he
has
more
in
his
head
than
we
three
put

said

james
james
of
sutton
visits
us
again
and
introduces
may
went
to
sutton
after
dinner
to
have
with
and
james
i
had
no
appetite
having
dined
well
at
two
and
the
entire
evening
was
spoiled
by
little
only
seems
to
me
to
be
an
utterly
spoiled
child
two
or
three
times
he
came
up
to
me
and
deliberately
kicked
my
shins
he
hurt
me
once
so
much
that
the
tears
came
into
my
eyes
i
gently
remonstrated
with
him
and
james
said
scold
him
i
do
not
believe
in
being
too
severe
with
young
children
you
spoil
their
little
percy
set
up
a
deafening
yell
here
and
when
carrie
tried
to
pacify
him
he
slapped
her
face
i
was
so
annoyed
i
said
is
not
my
idea
of
bringing
up
children
james
said
have
different
ideas
of
bringing
up
your
son
lupin
is
not
the
standard
of
a
mezzini
an
italian
i
fancy
here
took
percy
in
his
lap
the
child
wriggled
and
kicked
and
broke
away
from
mezzini
saying
like
got
a
dirty
a
very
nice
gentleman
birks
spooner
took
the
child
by
the
wrist
and
said
here
dear
and
listen
to
he
detached
his
chronometer
from
the
chain
and
made
his
watch
strike
six
to
our
horror
the
child
snatched
it
from
his
hand
and
bounced
it
down
upon
the
ground
like
one
would
a
ball
birks
spooner
was
most
amiable
and
said
he
could
easily
get
a
new
glass
put
in
and
did
not
suppose
the
works
were
damaged
to
show
you
how
opinions
differ
carrie
said
the
child
was
but
it
made
up
for
that
defect
by
its
looks
for
it
her
unquestionably
beautiful
child
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
do
not
think
i
have
seen
a
much
uglier
child
myself
that
is
opinion
may
know
why
it
is
but
i
never
anticipate
with
any
pleasure
the
visits
to
our
house
of
james
of
sutton
she
is
coming
again
to
stay
for
a
few
days
i
said
to
carrie
this
morning
as
i
was
leaving
wish
dear
carrie
i
could
like
james
better
than
i
carrie
said
do
i
dear
but
as
for
years
i
have
had
to
put
up
with
gowing
who
is
vulgar
and
cummings
who
is
kind
but
most
uninteresting
i
am
sure
dear
you
mind
the
occasional
visits
of
james
who
has
more
intellect
in
her
little
finger
than
both
your
friends
have
in
their
entire
i
was
so
entirely
taken
back
by
this
onslaught
on
my
two
dear
old
friends
i
could
say
nothing
and
as
i
heard
the
coming
i
left
with
a
hurried
little
too
hurried
perhaps
for
my
upper
lip
came
in
contact
with
teeth
and
slightly
cut
it
it
was
quite
painful
for
an
hour
afterwards
when
i
came
home
in
the
evening
i
found
carrie
buried
in
a
book
on
spiritualism
called
is
no
by
florence
singleyet
i
need
scarcely
say
the
book
was
sent
her
to
read
by
james
of
sutton
as
she
had
not
a
word
to
say
outside
her
book
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
altering
the
which
are
beginning
to
show
signs
of
wear
at
the
edges
james
arrived
and
as
usual
in
the
evening
took
the
entire
management
of
everything
finding
that
she
and
carrie
were
making
some
preparations
for
i
thought
it
time
really
to
put
my
foot
down
i
have
always
had
the
greatest
contempt
for
such
nonsense
and
put
an
end
to
it
years
ago
when
carrie
at
our
old
house
used
to
have
séances
every
night
with
poor
fussters
who
is
now
dead
if
i
could
see
any
use
in
it
i
would
not
care
as
i
stopped
it
in
the
days
gone
by
i
determined
to
do
so
now
i
said
am
very
sorry
james
but
i
totally
disapprove
of
it
apart
from
the
fact
that
i
receive
my
old
friends
on
this
james
said
you
mean
to
say
you
read
is
no
i
said
and
i
have
no
intention
of
doing
james
seemed
surprised
and
said
the
world
is
going
mad
over
the
i
responded
rather
cleverly
it
there
will
be
one
sane
man
in
it
at
all
james
said
she
thought
it
was
very
unkind
and
if
people
were
all
as
prejudiced
as
i
was
there
would
never
have
been
the
electric
telegraph
or
the
telephone
i
said
that
was
quite
a
different
thing
james
said
sharply
what
way
what
way
i
said
many
james
said
mention
i
replied
quietly
me
james
i
decline
to
discuss
the
matter
i
am
not
interested
in
sarah
at
this
moment
opened
the
door
and
showed
in
cummings
for
which
i
was
thankful
for
i
felt
it
would
put
a
stop
to
this
foolish
but
i
was
entirely
mistaken
for
on
the
subject
being
opened
again
cummings
said
he
was
most
interested
in
spiritualism
although
he
was
bound
to
confess
he
did
not
believe
much
in
it
still
he
was
willing
to
be
convinced
i
firmly
declined
to
take
any
part
in
it
with
the
result
that
my
presence
was
ignored
i
left
the
three
sitting
in
the
parlour
at
a
small
round
table
which
they
had
taken
out
of
the
i
walked
into
the
hall
with
the
ultimate
intention
of
taking
a
little
stroll
as
i
opened
the
door
who
should
come
in
but
gowing
on
hearing
what
was
going
on
he
proposed
that
we
should
join
the
circle
and
he
would
go
into
a
trance
he
added
that
he
a
few
things
about
old
cummings
and
would
a
few
about
james
knowing
how
dangerous
gowing
is
i
declined
to
let
him
take
part
in
any
such
foolish
performance
sarah
asked
me
if
she
could
go
out
for
half
an
hour
and
i
gave
her
permission
thinking
it
would
be
more
comfortable
to
sit
with
gowing
in
the
kitchen
than
in
the
cold
we
talked
a
good
deal
about
lupin
and
and
murray
posh
with
whom
he
is
as
usual
spending
the
evening
gowing
said
say
it
be
a
bad
thing
for
lupin
if
old
posh
kicked
the
my
heart
gave
a
leap
of
horror
and
i
rebuked
gowing
very
sternly
for
joking
on
such
a
subject
i
lay
awake
half
the
night
thinking
of
other
half
was
spent
in
nightmares
on
the
same
subject
may
wrote
a
stern
letter
to
the
laundress
i
was
rather
pleased
with
the
letter
for
i
thought
it
very
satirical
i
said
have
returned
the
handkerchiefs
without
the
colour
perhaps
you
will
return
either
the
colour
or
the
value
of
the
i
shall
be
rather
curious
to
know
what
she
will
have
to
say
more
in
the
evening
carrie
said
last
night
was
in
a
measure
successful
and
they
ought
to
sit
again
cummings
came
in
and
seemed
interested
i
had
the
gas
lighted
in
the
got
the
steps
and
repaired
the
cornice
which
has
been
a
bit
of
an
eyesore
to
me
in
a
fit
of
i
may
use
such
an
expression
gave
the
floor
over
the
parlour
where
the
séance
was
taking
place
two
loud
raps
with
the
hammer
i
felt
sorry
afterwards
for
it
was
the
sort
of
ridiculous
foolhardy
thing
that
gowing
or
lupin
would
have
done
however
they
never
even
referred
to
it
but
carrie
declared
that
a
message
came
through
the
table
to
her
of
a
wonderful
description
concerning
someone
whom
she
and
i
knew
years
ago
and
who
was
quite
unknown
to
the
others
when
we
went
to
bed
carrie
asked
me
as
a
favour
to
sit
night
to
oblige
her
she
said
it
seemed
rather
unkind
and
unsociable
on
my
part
i
promised
i
would
sit
once
june
sat
reluctantly
at
the
table
in
the
evening
and
i
am
bound
to
admit
some
curious
things
happened
i
contend
they
were
coincidences
but
they
were
curious
for
instance
the
table
kept
tilting
towards
me
which
carrie
construed
as
a
desire
that
i
should
ask
the
spirit
a
question
i
obeyed
the
rules
and
i
asked
the
spirit
who
said
her
name
was
lina
if
she
could
tell
me
the
name
of
an
old
aunt
of
whom
i
was
thinking
and
whom
we
used
to
call
aunt
maggie
the
table
spelled
out
c
a
we
could
make
nothing
out
of
it
till
i
suddenly
remembered
that
her
second
name
was
catherine
which
it
was
evidently
trying
to
spell
i
think
even
carrie
knew
this
but
if
she
did
she
would
never
cheat
i
must
admit
it
was
curious
several
other
things
happened
and
i
consented
to
sit
at
another
séance
on
monday
june
laundress
called
and
said
she
was
very
sorry
about
the
handkerchiefs
and
returned
ninepence
i
said
as
the
colour
was
completely
washed
out
and
the
handkerchiefs
quite
spoiled
ninepence
was
not
enough
carrie
replied
that
the
two
handkerchiefs
originally
only
cost
sixpence
for
she
remembered
buying
them
at
a
sale
at
the
holloway
in
that
case
i
insisted
that
threepence
should
be
returned
to
the
laundress
lupin
has
gone
to
stay
with
the
poshs
for
a
few
days
i
must
say
i
feel
very
uncomfortable
about
it
carrie
said
i
was
ridiculous
to
worry
about
it
posh
was
very
fond
of
lupin
who
after
all
was
only
a
mere
boy
in
the
evening
we
had
another
séance
which
in
some
respects
was
very
remarkable
although
the
first
part
of
it
was
a
little
doubtful
gowing
called
as
well
as
cummings
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
join
the
circle
i
wanted
to
object
but
james
who
appears
a
good
medium
that
is
if
there
is
anything
in
it
at
all
thought
there
might
be
a
little
more
spirit
power
if
gowing
joined
so
the
five
of
us
sat
down
the
moment
i
turned
out
the
gas
and
almost
before
i
could
get
my
hands
on
the
table
it
rocked
violently
and
tilted
and
began
moving
quickly
across
the
room
gowing
shouted
out
oh
steady
lad
steady
i
told
gowing
if
he
could
not
behave
himself
i
should
light
the
gas
and
put
an
end
to
the
séance
to
tell
the
truth
i
thought
gowing
was
playing
tricks
and
i
hinted
as
much
but
james
said
she
had
often
seen
the
table
go
right
off
the
ground
the
spirit
lina
came
again
and
said
three
or
four
times
and
declined
to
explain
james
said
was
stubborn
sometimes
she
often
behaved
like
that
and
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
send
her
away
she
then
hit
the
table
sharply
and
said
away
lina
you
are
disagreeable
go
away
i
should
think
we
sat
nearly
of
an
hour
with
nothing
happening
my
hands
felt
quite
cold
and
i
suggested
we
should
stop
the
séance
carrie
and
james
as
well
as
cummings
would
not
agree
to
it
in
about
ten
time
there
was
some
tilting
towards
me
i
gave
the
alphabet
and
it
spelled
out
s
p
o
o
as
i
have
heard
both
gowing
and
lupin
use
the
word
and
as
i
could
hear
gowing
silently
laughing
i
directly
accused
him
of
pushing
the
table
he
denied
it
but
i
regret
to
say
i
did
not
believe
him
gowing
said
it
means
a
i
said
know
it
mean
anything
of
the
gowing
said
very
sorry
i
and
he
rose
from
the
table
no
one
took
any
notice
of
the
stupid
joke
and
james
suggested
he
should
sit
out
for
a
while
gowing
consented
and
sat
in
the
the
table
began
to
move
again
and
we
might
have
had
a
wonderful
séance
but
for
stupid
interruptions
in
answer
to
the
alphabet
from
carrie
the
table
spelt
then
the
three
times
we
could
not
think
what
it
meant
till
cummings
pointed
out
that
was
lupin
spelled
backwards
this
was
quite
exciting
carrie
was
particularly
excited
and
said
she
hoped
nothing
horrible
was
going
to
happen
james
asked
if
was
the
spirit
the
table
replied
firmly
and
the
spirit
would
not
give
his
or
her
name
we
then
had
the
message
will
be
very
carrie
said
she
felt
quite
relieved
but
the
word
was
again
spelt
out
the
table
then
began
to
oscillate
violently
and
in
reply
to
james
who
spoke
very
softly
to
the
table
the
spirit
began
to
spell
its
name
it
first
spelled
gowing
here
said
more
in
my
i
asked
him
to
be
quiet
as
the
name
might
not
be
completed
the
table
then
spelt
gowing
here
interrupted
again
and
said
in
my
line
if
you
like
but
not
carrie
appealed
to
him
to
be
quiet
the
table
then
spelt
and
james
startled
us
by
crying
out
drinkwater
a
very
old
friend
of
my
who
has
been
dead
some
this
was
more
interesting
and
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
after
all
there
must
be
something
in
spiritualism
james
asked
the
spirit
to
interpret
the
meaning
of
the
word
as
applied
to
the
alphabet
was
given
again
and
we
got
the
word
gowing
here
muttered
it
james
said
she
did
not
think
the
spirit
meant
that
as
captain
drinkwater
was
a
perfect
gentleman
and
would
never
have
used
the
word
in
answer
to
a
question
accordingly
the
alphabet
was
given
again
this
time
the
table
spelled
distinctly
we
all
thought
of
murray
posh
and
lupin
carrie
was
getting
a
little
distressed
and
as
it
was
getting
late
we
broke
up
the
circle
we
arranged
to
have
one
more
as
it
will
be
last
night
in
town
we
also
determined
to
have
gowing
present
cummings
before
leaving
said
it
was
certainly
interesting
but
he
wished
the
spirits
would
say
something
about
him
june
looking
forward
to
the
séance
this
evening
was
thinking
of
it
all
the
day
at
the
office
just
as
we
sat
down
at
the
table
we
were
annoyed
by
gowing
entering
without
knocking
he
said
am
not
going
to
stop
but
i
have
brought
with
me
a
sealed
envelope
which
i
know
i
can
trust
with
pooter
in
that
sealed
envelope
is
a
strip
of
paper
on
which
i
have
asked
a
simple
question
if
the
spirits
can
answer
that
question
i
will
believe
in
i
ventured
the
expression
that
it
might
be
impossible
james
said
no
it
is
of
common
occurrence
for
the
spirits
to
answer
questions
under
such
even
for
them
to
write
on
locked
slates
it
is
quite
worth
trying
if
is
in
a
good
temper
she
is
certain
to
do
gowing
said
right
then
i
shall
be
a
firm
believer
i
shall
perhaps
drop
in
about
nine
or
ten
and
hear
the
he
then
left
and
we
sat
a
long
time
cummings
wanted
to
know
something
about
some
undertaking
in
which
he
was
concerned
but
he
could
get
no
answer
of
any
description
which
he
said
he
was
very
disappointed
and
was
afraid
there
was
not
much
in
after
all
i
thought
this
rather
selfish
of
him
the
séance
was
very
similar
to
the
one
last
night
almost
the
same
in
fact
so
we
turned
to
the
letter
took
a
long
time
answering
the
question
but
eventually
spelt
out
lilies
and
there
was
great
rocking
of
the
table
at
this
time
and
james
said
that
is
captain
drinkwater
let
us
ask
him
the
answer
as
well
it
was
the
spirit
of
the
captain
and
most
singular
he
gave
the
same
identical
answer
lilies
and
i
can
not
describe
the
agitation
with
which
carrie
broke
the
seal
or
the
disappointment
we
felt
on
reading
the
question
to
which
the
answer
was
so
inappropriate
the
question
was
old
this
quite
decided
me
as
i
had
put
my
foot
down
on
spiritualism
years
ago
so
i
would
again
i
am
pretty
as
a
rule
but
i
can
be
extremely
firm
when
driven
to
it
i
said
slowly
as
i
turned
up
the
gas
is
the
last
of
this
nonsense
that
shall
ever
take
place
under
my
roof
i
regret
i
permitted
myself
to
be
a
party
to
such
tomfoolery
if
there
is
anything
in
i
is
nothing
of
any
good
and
i
have
it
that
is
james
said
think
pooter
you
are
rather
i
said
madam
i
am
master
of
this
understand
james
made
an
observation
which
i
sincerely
hope
i
was
mistaken
in
i
was
in
such
a
rage
i
could
not
quite
catch
what
she
said
but
if
i
thought
she
said
what
it
sounded
like
she
should
never
enter
the
house
again
chapter
xxiii
lupin
leaves
us
we
dine
at
his
new
apartments
and
hear
some
extraordinary
information
respecting
the
wealth
of
murray
posh
meet
miss
lilian
posh
am
sent
for
by
hardfur
huttle
important
july
find
on
looking
over
my
diary
nothing
of
any
consequence
has
taken
place
during
the
last
month
we
lose
lupin
who
has
taken
furnished
apartments
at
bayswater
near
his
friends
and
murray
posh
at
two
guineas
a
week
i
think
this
is
most
extravagant
of
him
as
it
is
half
his
salary
lupin
says
one
never
loses
by
a
good
address
and
to
use
his
own
expression
brickfield
terrace
is
a
bit
whether
he
means
it
is
i
do
not
know
i
have
long
since
given
up
trying
to
understand
his
curious
expressions
i
said
the
neighbourhood
had
always
been
good
enough
for
his
parents
his
reply
was
is
no
question
of
being
good
or
bad
there
is
no
money
in
it
and
i
am
not
going
to
rot
away
my
life
in
the
we
are
sorry
to
lose
him
but
perhaps
he
will
get
on
better
by
himself
and
there
may
be
some
truth
in
his
remark
that
an
old
and
a
young
horse
pull
together
in
the
same
cart
gowing
called
and
said
that
the
house
seemed
quite
peaceful
and
like
old
times
he
liked
master
lupin
very
well
but
he
occasionally
suffered
from
what
he
could
not
july
called
looked
very
pale
and
said
he
had
been
very
ill
again
and
of
course
not
a
single
friend
had
been
near
him
carrie
said
she
had
never
heard
of
it
whereupon
he
threw
down
a
copy
of
the
on
the
table
with
the
following
paragraph
regret
to
hear
that
that
favourite
old
roadster
cummings
cummings
has
met
with
what
might
have
been
a
serious
accident
in
rye
lane
a
mischievous
boy
threw
a
stick
between
the
spokes
of
one
of
the
back
wheels
and
the
machine
overturned
bringing
our
brother
tricyclist
heavily
to
the
ground
fortunately
he
was
more
frightened
than
hurt
but
we
missed
his
merry
face
at
the
dinner
at
chingford
where
they
turned
up
in
good
numbers
health
was
proposed
by
our
popular
vice
westropp
the
prince
of
bicyclists
who
in
his
happiest
vein
said
it
was
a
case
of
s
the
but
fortunately
there
was
more
than
a
joke
which
created
roars
of
we
all
said
we
were
very
sorry
and
pressed
cummings
to
stay
to
supper
cummings
said
it
was
like
old
times
being
without
lupin
and
he
was
much
better
away
july
the
afternoon
as
i
was
looking
out
of
the
parlour
window
which
was
open
a
grand
trap
driven
by
a
lady
with
a
gentleman
seated
by
the
side
of
her
stopped
at
our
door
not
wishing
to
be
seen
i
withdrew
my
head
very
quickly
knocking
the
back
of
it
violently
against
the
sharp
edge
of
the
i
was
nearly
stunned
there
was
a
loud
at
the
front
door
carrie
rushed
out
of
the
parlour
upstairs
to
her
room
and
i
followed
as
carrie
thought
it
was
perkupp
i
thought
it
was
whispered
to
sarah
over
the
banisters
them
into
the
sarah
said
as
the
shutters
were
not
opened
the
room
would
smell
musty
there
was
another
loud
i
whispered
show
them
into
the
parlour
and
say
pooter
will
be
down
i
changed
my
coat
but
could
not
see
to
do
my
hair
as
carrie
was
occupying
the
glass
sarah
came
up
and
said
it
was
murray
posh
and
lupin
this
was
quite
a
relief
i
went
down
with
carrie
and
lupin
met
me
with
the
remark
say
what
did
you
run
away
from
the
window
for
did
we
frighten
you
i
foolishly
said
window
lupin
said
you
know
shut
it
you
looked
as
if
you
were
playing
at
punch
and
on
carrie
asking
if
she
could
offer
them
anything
lupin
said
i
think
daisy
will
take
on
a
cup
of
tea
i
can
do
with
a
and
i
said
am
afraid
we
have
no
lupin
said
bother
about
that
you
just
trip
out
and
hold
the
horse
i
think
sarah
understands
they
stayed
a
very
short
time
and
as
they
were
leaving
lupin
said
want
you
both
to
come
and
dine
with
me
next
wednesday
and
see
my
new
place
and
murray
posh
miss
posh
sister
are
coming
eight
sharp
no
one
i
said
we
did
not
pretend
to
be
fashionable
people
and
would
like
the
dinner
earlier
as
it
made
it
so
late
before
we
got
home
lupin
said
you
must
get
used
to
it
if
it
comes
to
that
daisy
and
i
can
drive
you
we
promised
to
go
but
i
must
say
in
my
simple
mind
the
familiar
way
in
which
posh
and
lupin
addressed
each
other
is
reprehensible
anybody
would
think
they
had
been
children
together
i
certainly
should
object
to
a
six
acquaintance
calling
wife
and
driving
out
with
her
july
rooms
looked
very
nice
but
the
dinner
was
i
thought
a
little
too
grand
especially
as
he
commenced
with
champagne
straight
off
i
also
think
lupin
might
have
told
us
that
he
and
and
murray
posh
and
miss
posh
were
going
to
put
on
full
evening
dress
knowing
that
the
dinner
was
only
for
us
six
we
never
dreamed
it
would
be
a
full
dress
affair
i
had
no
appetite
it
was
quite
twenty
minutes
past
eight
before
we
sat
down
to
dinner
at
six
i
could
have
eaten
a
hearty
meal
i
had
a
bit
of
at
that
hour
feeling
famished
and
i
expect
that
partly
spoiled
my
appetite
we
were
introduced
to
miss
posh
whom
lupin
called
girl
as
if
he
had
known
her
all
his
life
she
was
very
tall
rather
plain
and
i
thought
she
was
a
little
painted
round
the
eyes
i
hope
i
am
wrong
but
she
had
such
fair
hair
and
yet
her
eyebrows
were
black
she
looked
about
thirty
i
did
not
like
the
way
she
kept
giggling
and
giving
lupin
smacks
and
pinching
him
then
her
laugh
was
a
sort
of
a
scream
that
went
right
through
my
ears
all
the
more
irritating
because
there
was
nothing
to
laugh
at
in
fact
carrie
and
i
were
not
at
all
prepossessed
with
her
they
all
smoked
cigarettes
after
dinner
including
miss
posh
who
startled
carrie
by
saying
you
smoke
dear
i
answered
for
carrie
and
said
charles
pooter
has
not
arrived
at
it
yet
whereupon
miss
posh
gave
one
of
her
piercing
laughs
again
posh
sang
a
dozen
songs
at
least
and
i
can
only
repeat
what
i
have
said
does
sing
in
tune
but
lupin
sat
by
the
side
of
the
piano
gazing
into
her
eyes
the
whole
time
if
i
had
been
posh
i
think
i
should
have
had
something
to
say
about
it
posh
made
himself
very
agreeable
to
us
and
eventually
sent
us
home
in
his
carriage
which
i
thought
most
kind
he
is
evidently
very
rich
for
posh
had
on
some
beautiful
jewellery
she
told
carrie
her
necklace
which
her
husband
gave
her
as
a
birthday
present
alone
cost
posh
said
he
had
a
great
belief
in
lupin
and
thought
he
would
make
rapid
way
in
the
world
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
posh
lost
over
the
through
advice
during
the
evening
i
had
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
lupin
and
expressed
a
hope
that
posh
was
not
living
beyond
his
means
lupin
sneered
and
said
posh
was
worth
thousands
was
a
household
word
in
birmingham
manchester
liverpool
and
all
the
big
towns
throughout
england
lupin
further
informed
me
that
posh
was
opening
branch
establishments
at
new
york
sydney
and
melbourne
and
was
negotiating
for
kimberley
and
johannesburg
i
said
i
was
pleased
to
hear
it
lupin
said
he
has
settled
over
on
daisy
and
the
same
amount
on
if
at
any
time
i
wanted
a
little
capital
he
would
put
up
a
couple
of
at
a
notice
and
could
buy
up
firm
over
his
head
at
any
moment
with
ready
on
the
way
home
in
the
carriage
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
was
inclined
to
indulge
in
the
radical
thought
that
money
was
properly
divided
on
arriving
home
at
a
eleven
we
found
a
hansom
cab
which
had
been
waiting
for
me
for
two
hours
with
a
letter
sarah
said
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
as
we
had
not
left
the
address
where
we
had
gone
i
trembled
as
i
opened
the
letter
fearing
it
was
some
bad
news
about
perkupp
the
note
was
pooter
down
to
the
victoria
hotel
without
delay
important
yours
truly
hardfur
i
asked
the
cabman
if
it
was
too
late
the
cabman
replied
that
it
was
for
his
instructions
were
if
i
happened
to
be
out
he
was
to
wait
till
i
came
home
i
felt
very
tired
and
really
wanted
to
go
to
bed
i
reached
the
hotel
at
a
quarter
before
midnight
i
apologised
for
being
so
late
but
huttle
said
at
all
come
and
have
a
few
i
feel
my
heart
beating
as
i
write
these
words
to
be
brief
huttle
said
he
had
a
rich
american
friend
who
wanted
to
do
something
large
in
our
line
of
business
and
that
franching
had
mentioned
my
name
to
him
we
talked
over
the
matter
if
by
any
happy
chance
the
result
be
successful
i
can
more
than
compensate
my
dear
master
for
the
loss
of
custom
huttle
had
previously
said
glorious
is
a
lucky
day
for
america
and
as
it
has
not
yet
struck
twelve
we
will
celebrate
it
with
a
glass
of
the
best
wine
to
be
had
in
the
place
and
drink
good
luck
to
our
bit
of
i
fervently
hope
it
will
bring
good
luck
to
us
all
it
was
two
when
i
got
home
although
i
was
so
tired
i
could
not
sleep
except
for
short
only
to
dream
i
kept
dreaming
of
perkupp
and
huttle
the
latter
was
in
a
lovely
palace
with
a
crown
on
perkupp
was
waiting
in
the
room
huttle
kept
taking
off
this
crown
and
handing
it
to
me
and
calling
me
he
appeared
to
take
no
notice
of
perkupp
and
i
kept
asking
huttle
to
give
the
crown
to
my
worthy
master
huttle
kept
saying
this
is
the
white
house
of
washington
and
you
must
keep
your
crown
we
all
laughed
long
and
very
loudly
till
i
got
parched
and
then
i
woke
up
i
fell
asleep
only
to
dream
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
chapter
the
last
one
of
the
happiest
days
of
my
life
july
excitement
and
anxiety
through
which
i
have
gone
the
last
few
days
have
been
almost
enough
to
turn
my
hair
grey
it
is
all
but
settled
the
die
will
be
cast
i
have
written
a
long
letter
to
it
my
duty
to
do
so
his
attention
to
posh
for
they
drove
up
to
our
house
again
last
night
july
find
my
eyes
filling
with
tears
as
i
pen
the
note
of
my
interview
this
morning
with
perkupp
addressing
me
he
said
faithful
servant
i
will
not
dwell
on
the
important
service
you
have
done
our
firm
you
can
never
be
sufficiently
thanked
let
us
change
the
subject
do
you
like
your
house
and
are
you
happy
where
you
are
i
replied
sir
i
love
my
house
and
i
love
the
neighbourhood
and
could
not
bear
to
leave
perkupp
to
my
surprise
said
pooter
i
will
purchase
the
freehold
of
that
house
and
present
it
to
the
most
honest
and
most
worthy
man
it
has
ever
been
my
lot
to
he
shook
my
hand
and
said
he
hoped
my
wife
and
i
would
be
spared
many
years
to
enjoy
it
my
heart
was
too
full
to
thank
him
and
seeing
my
embarrassment
the
good
fellow
said
need
say
nothing
pooter
and
left
the
office
i
sent
telegrams
to
carrie
gowing
and
cummings
a
thing
i
have
never
done
before
and
asked
the
two
latter
to
come
round
to
supper
on
arriving
home
i
found
carrie
crying
with
joy
and
i
sent
sarah
round
to
the
to
get
two
bottles
of
my
two
dear
friends
came
in
the
evening
and
the
last
post

letter
from
lupin
in
reply
to
mine

read
it
aloud
to
them

on
the
wrong
tack
