hyacinth
by
george
birmingham
chapter
i
in
the
year
or
thereabouts
religious
and
charitable
society
in
england
was
seized
with
a
desire
to
convert
irish
roman
catholics
to
the
protestant
faith
it
is
clear
to
everyone
with
any
experience
of
missionary
societies
that
the
more
remote
the
field
of
actual
work
the
easier
it
is
to
keep
alive
the
interest
of
subscribers
the
mission
to
roman
catholics
therefore
commenced
in
that
western
portion
of
galway
which
the
modern
tourist
knows
as
connemara
and
the
enthusiasm
was
immense
elderly
ladies
often
with
titles
were
energetic
in
the
cause
of
the
new
reformation
young
ladies
some
of
them
very
attractive
collected
money
from
their
brothers
and
admirers
and
bishops
headed
the
and
influential
committees
earnestly
debated
plans
for
spending
the
money
which
poured
in
faith
in
the
efficacy
of
money
handled
by
influential
committees
is
one
of
the
characteristics
of
the
english
people
and
in
this
particular
case
it
seemed
as
if
their
faith
were
to
be
justified
by
results
most
encouraging
reports
were
sent
to
headquarters
from
connemara
it
appeared
that
converts
were
flocking
in
and
that
the
schools
of
the
missionaries
were
filled
to
overflowing
in
the
matter
of
education
circumstances
favoured
the
new
reformation
the
leonine
john
mchale
the
papal
archbishop
of
tuam
pursued
a
policy
which
drove
the
children
of
his
flock
into
the
mission
schools
the
only
other
kind
of
education
available
was
that
which
some
humorous
english
statesman
had
called
and
it
did
not
seem
to
the
archbishop
desirable
that
an
irish
boy
should
be
beaten
for
speaking
his
own
language
or
rewarded
for
calling
himself
happy
english
he
refused
to
allow
the
building
of
national
schools
in
his
diocese
and
thus
left
the
cleverer
boys
to
drift
into
the
mission
schools
where
they
learnt
carefully
selected
texts
of
scripture
along
with
the
the
best
of
them
were
pushed
on
through
dublin
university
and
crowned
the
hopes
of
their
teachers
by
taking
holy
orders
in
the
church
of
england
there
are
still
to
be
met
with
in
galway
and
mayo
ancient
peasants
and
inhabitants
of
workhouses
who
speak
with
a
certain
pride
of
brother
the
there
are
also
here
and
there
in
english
rectories
elderly
gentlemen
who
have
almost
forgotten
the
thatched
cottages
where
they
ate
their
earliest
potatoes
among
these
cleverer
boys
was
one
æneas
conneally
who
was
something
more
than
clever
he
was
also
religious
in
an
intense
and
enthusiastic
manner
which
puzzled
his
teachers
while
it
pleased
them
his
ancestors
had
lived
for
generations
on
a
seaboard
farm
watered
by
salt
rain
swept
by
misty
storms
the
famine
and
the
fever
that
followed
it
left
him
fatherless
and
brotherless
the
emigration
schemes
robbed
him
and
his
mother
of
their
surviving
relations
the
mission
school
and
the
charity
effected
the
half
conversion
of
the
mother
and
a
acceptance
of
the
new
faith
on
the
part
of
æneas
unlike
most
of
his
fellows
in
the
college
classrooms
he
refused
to
regard
an
english
curacy
as
the
goal
of
his
ambition
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
conversion
ought
not
to
end
in
his
parading
the
streets
of
liverpool
in
a
black
coat
and
a
white
tie
he
wanted
to
return
to
his
people
and
tell
them
in
their
own
tongue
the
gospel
which
he
had
found
so
beautiful
the
london
committee
meditated
on
his
request
and
before
they
arrived
at
a
conclusion
his
mother
died
having
at
the
last
moment
made
a
tardy
submission
to
the
church
she
had
denied
her
apostasy
so
the
missionaries
called
it
confirmed
the
resolution
of
her
son
and
the
committee
at
length
agreed
to
allow
him
to
return
to
his
native
village
as
the
first
rector
of
the
parish
of
carrowkeel
he
was
provided
with
all
that
seemed
necessary
to
insure
the
success
of
his
work
they
built
him
a
gray
house
low
and
strong
for
it
had
to
withstand
the
gales
which
swept
in
from
the
atlantic
they
bought
him
a
field
where
a
cow
could
graze
and
an
acre
of
bog
to
cut
turf
from
a
church
was
built
for
him
gray
and
strong
like
his
house
it
was
fitted
with
comfortable
pews
a
pulpit
a
and
a
movable
table
of
wood
decently
covered
with
a
crimson
cloth
beyond
the
church
stood
the
school
he
had
attended
as
a
boy
whitewashed
without
and
draped
inside
with
maps
and
illuminated
texts
a
salary
not
princely
but
sufficient
was
voted
to
conneally
and
he
was
given
authority
over
a
and
a
schoolmaster
the
whole
group
of
mission
buildings
the
rectory
the
church
and
the
school
stood
like
types
of
the
uncompromising
spirit
of
protestantism
upon
the
bare
hillside
swept
by
every
storm
battered
by
the
atlantic
spray
below
them
carrowkeel
the
village
cowered
in
such
shelter
as
the
sandhills
afforded
eastward
lonely
cottages
faintly
smoking
dots
in
the
landscape
straggled
away
to
the
rugged
bases
of
the
mountains
the
rev
æneas
conneally
entered
upon
his
mission
enthusiastically
and
the
london
committee
awaited
results
there
were
scarcely
any
results
certainly
none
that
could
be
considered
satisfactory
the
day
for
making
conversions
was
past
and
the
tide
had
set
decisively
against
the
new
reformation
a
national
school
started
by
a
clearsighted
priest
in
spite
of
his
archbishop
left
the
mission
school
almost
without
pupils
the
lost
heart
and
took
to
seeking
encouragement
in
the
he
found
it
and
once
when
exalted
he
said
spiritually
paraded
the
streets
cursing
the
virgin
mary
worse
followed
and
the
committee
in
london
dismissed
the
man
a
diminishing
income
forced
on
them
the
necessity
of
economy
and
no
successor
was
appointed
for
a
few
years
conneally
laboured
on
then
a
inspector
from
london
discovered
that
the
schoolmaster
took
very
little
trouble
about
teaching
but
displayed
great
talent
in
prompting
his
children
at
examinations
he
too
was
dismissed
and
the
committee
still
bent
on
economy
appointed
a
mistress
in
his
place
she
was
a
pretty
girl
and
after
she
had
shivered
through
the
stormy
nights
of
two
winters
in
the
lonely
conneally
married
her
afterwards
the
office
of
was
also
left
vacant
the
whitewashed
school
fell
gradually
into
decay
and
the
committee
effected
a
further
saving
after
his
marriage
missionary
enthusiasm
began
to
flag
his
contact
with
womanhood
humanized
him
the
sternness
of
the
reformer
died
in
him
and
his
neighbours
who
never
could
comprehend
his
religion
came
to
understand
the
man
they
learned
to
look
upon
him
as
a
friend
to
seek
his
sympathy
and
help
in
time
they
learnt
to
love
him
two
years
passed
and
a
son
was
born
the
village
people
crowded
upon
him
with
congratulations
and
mothers
of
wide
experience
praised
the
boy
till
heart
swelled
in
her
with
pride
he
was
christened
hyacinth
after
a
great
pioneer
and
leader
of
the
mission
work
the
naming
was
act
of
contrition
for
the
forsaking
of
his
enthusiasm
his
recognition
of
the
value
of
a
zeal
which
had
not
flagged
failing
the
attainment
of
greatness
the
next
best
thing
is
to
dedicate
a
new
life
to
a
patron
saint
who
has
won
the
reward
of
those
who
endure
to
the
end
for
two
years
more
life
in
the
glebe
house
was
rapturously
happy
such
bliss
has
in
it
no
doubt
an
element
of
sin
and
it
is
not
good
that
it
should
endure
this
was
to
be
seen
afterwards
in
calmer
times
though
hardly
at
the
moment
when
the
break
came
there
was
a
hope
of
a
second
child
a
delightful
time
of
expectation
then
an
accident
the
blighting
of
the
hope
and
in
a
few
days
the
death
of
conneally
her
husband
buried
her
digging
the
first
grave
in
the
rocky
ground
that
lay
around
the
little
church
for
a
time
conneally
was
stunned
by
his
sorrow
he
stopped
working
altogether
ceased
to
think
even
to
feel
men
avoided
him
with
instinctive
reverence
at
first
and
afterwards
with
fear
as
he
wandered
muttering
to
himself
among
the
sandhills
and
along
the
beach
after
a
while
the
power
of
thought
and
a
sense
of
the
outward
things
of
life
returned
to
him
he
found
that
an
aged
crone
from
the
village
had
established
herself
in
his
house
and
was
caring
for
hyacinth
he
let
her
stay
and
according
to
her
abilities
she
cooked
and
washed
for
him
and
the
boy
neither
asking
wages
nor
taking
orders
from
him
until
she
died
hyacinth
grew
and
throve
amazingly
from
morning
till
evening
he
was
in
the
village
among
the
boats
beside
the
little
pier
or
in
the
fields
when
the
men
worked
there
everyone
petted
and
loved
him
from
father
moran
the
priest
who
had
started
the
national
school
down
to
old
shamus
the
crippled
singer
of
interminable
irish
songs
and
teller
of
heroic
legends
of
the
past
it
was
when
he
heard
the
boy
repeat
a
story
of
finn
maccool
to
the
old
crone
in
the
kitchen
that
conneally
awoke
to
the
idea
that
he
must
educate
his
son
he
began
naturally
enough
with
irish
for
it
was
irish
and
not
english
that
hyacinth
spoke
fluently
afterwards
the
english
alphabet
followed
though
not
for
the
sake
of
reading
books
for
except
the
bible
and
the
hyacinth
was
taught
to
read
no
english
books
he
learned
latin
after
a
fashion
not
with
nice
attention
to
complexities
of
syntax
but
as
a
language
meant
to
be
used
read
and
even
spoken
now
and
then
to
father
moran
meanwhile
the
passage
of
the
years
brought
changes
to
carrowkeel
the
admiralty
established
a
coastguard
station
near
the
village
and
arranged
for
the
greater
security
of
the
empire
that
men
in
clothes
should
take
it
in
turns
to
look
at
the
atlantic
through
a
telescope
then
the
unquiet
spirit
of
the
congested
districts
board
possessed
the
place
for
a
while
a
young
engineer
designed
a
new
pier
to
shelter
he
galvanized
the
people
into
unwonted
activity
and
though
sceptical
of
good
results
they
earned
a
weekly
wage
by
building
it
boats
came
great
able
boats
which
fought
the
atlantic
and
the
old
curraghs
were
left
to
blister
in
the
sun
far
up
on
the
beach
instructors
from
the
isle
of
man
taught
new
ways
of
catching
mackerel
green
patches
between
the
cottages
and
the
sea
once
the
playground
of
pigs
and
children
or
the
marine
parade
of
solemn
lines
of
geese
were
spread
with
brown
nets
on
may
mornings
if
the
take
was
good
long
lines
of
carts
rattled
down
the
road
carrying
the
fish
to
the
railway
at
clifden
and
the
place
bore
for
a
while
the
appearance
of
vitality
a
vagrant
englishman
discovered
that
lobsters
could
be
had
almost
for
the
asking
in
carrowkeel
the
commercial
instincts
of
his
race
were
aroused
in
him
he
established
a
trade
between
the
villagers
and
the
fishmongers
of
manchester
the
price
of
lobsters
rose
to
the
unprecedented
figure
of
four
shillings
a
dozen
and
it
was
supposed
that
even
so
the
promoter
of
the
scheme
secured
a
profit
to
æneas
conneally
growing
quietly
old
the
changes
meant
very
little
the
coastguards
being
bound
by
one
of
the
articles
of
the
british
constitution
came
to
church
on
sunday
mornings
with
exemplary
regularity
and
each
man
at
fixed
intervals
brought
a
baby
to
be
christened
and
a
woman
to
be
churched
otherwise
they
hardly
affected
life
the
great
officials
who
visited
carrowkeel
to
survey
the
benignant
activities
of
the
congested
districts
board
were
men
whose
magnificent
intellectual
powers
raised
them
above
any
recognised
form
of
christianity
neither
father
ministrations
nor
appealed
to
them
the
london
committee
of
the
mission
to
roman
catholics
made
no
inquiry
about
what
was
going
on
at
carrowkeel
they
asked
for
no
statistics
expected
no
results
but
signed
quarterly
cheques
for
conneally
presuming
one
may
suppose
that
if
he
had
ceased
to
exist
they
would
somehow
have
heard
of
it
by
far
the
most
important
event
for
hyacinth
and
his
father
was
the
death
of
their
old
housekeeper
in
the
changed
state
of
society
in
carrowkeel
it
was
found
impossible
to
secure
the
services
of
another
hyacinth
at
this
time
about
fifteen
years
old
took
to
the
housework
without
feeling
that
he
was
doing
anything
strange
or
unmanly
he
was
familiar
with
the
position
of
who
having
grown
elderly
under
the
care
of
a
mother
preferred
afterwards
the
toil
of
their
own
kitchens
to
the
uncertain
issue
of
marrying
a
girl
to
for
life
under
their
altered
circumstances
was
simplified
it
seemed
unnecessary
to
carry
a
meal
from
the
room
it
was
cooked
in
to
another
for
the
purpose
of
eating
it
so
the
front
rooms
of
the
house
with
their
tattered
furniture
were
left
to
moulder
quietly
in
the
persistent
damp
one
door
was
felt
to
be
sufficient
for
the
ingress
and
egress
of
two
people
from
a
house
the
kitchen
door
being
at
the
back
of
the
house
was
oftenest
the
sheltered
one
so
the
front
door
was
bolted
and
the
grass
grew
up
to
it
one
by
one
as
education
required
the
latin
and
greek
books
were
removed
from
the
forsaken
study
and
took
their
places
among
the
diminishing
array
of
plates
and
cups
on
the
kitchen
dresser
the
spreading
and
removal
of
a
tablecloth
for
every
meal
came
to
be
regarded
as
foolish
toil
when
room
was
required
on
the
table
for
plates
the
books
and
papers
were
swept
on
one
side
a
pile
of
potatoes
and
the
pan
with
bacon
or
a
fish
perhaps
still
frizzling
in
it
was
set
in
the
place
left
vacant
morning
and
evening
æneas
conneally
expected
his
son
to
join
with
him
in
prayer
the
two
knelt
together
on
the
earthen
floor
facing
the
window
while
the
old
man
meditated
aloud
on
divine
things
there
were
breaks
in
his
speech
and
long
silences
so
that
sometimes
it
was
hard
to
tell
when
his
prayer
had
really
ended
these
devotions
formed
a
part
of
his
life
into
which
hyacinth
never
really
entered
at
all
he
neither
rebelled
nor
mocked
he
simply
remained
outside
so
when
his
father
wandered
off
to
solitary
places
on
the
seashore
and
sat
gazing
into
the
sunset
or
a
gathering
storm
hyacinth
neither
followed
nor
questioned
him
sometimes
on
winter
nights
when
the
wind
howled
more
fiercely
than
usual
round
the
house
the
old
man
would
close
the
book
they
read
together
and
repeat
aloud
long
passages
from
the
apocalypse
his
voice
weak
and
wavering
at
first
would
gather
strength
as
he
proceeded
and
the
young
man
listened
stirred
to
vague
emotion
over
the
fall
of
babylon
the
great
for
the
most
part
time
was
his
own
even
the
hours
of
study
were
uncertain
he
read
when
he
liked
and
his
father
seemed
content
with
long
days
of
idleness
followed
by
others
of
application
it
was
indeed
only
owing
to
his
love
of
what
he
read
that
the
boy
learned
at
all
often
while
he
tramped
from
his
home
to
the
village
at
midday
his
heart
was
hot
within
him
with
some
great
thought
which
had
sprung
to
him
from
a
hastily
construed
chorus
of
euripides
sometimes
he
startled
the
fishermen
when
he
went
with
them
at
night
by
chanting
rolling
hexameters
through
the
darkness
while
the
boat
lay
waiting
borne
gunwale
down
to
the
black
water
with
the
drag
of
the
net
that
had
been
shot
there
was
a
tacit
understanding
that
hyacinth
like
his
father
was
to
take
holy
orders
he
matriculated
in
trinity
college
when
he
was
eighteen
and
as
is
often
done
by
poorer
students
remained
at
home
merely
passing
the
required
examinations
until
he
took
his
degree
and
the
time
came
for
his
entering
the
divinity
school
then
it
became
necessary
for
him
to
reside
in
dublin
and
the
first
great
change
in
his
life
took
place
the
night
before
he
left
home
he
and
his
father
sat
together
in
the
kitchen
after
they
had
finished
their
evening
meal
for
a
long
time
neither
of
them
spoke
hyacinth
held
a
book
in
his
hand
but
scarcely
attempted
to
read
it
his
thoughts
wandered
from
hopeful
expectation
of
what
the
future
was
to
bring
him
and
the
new
life
was
to
mean
to
vague
regrets
weighted
with
misgivings
which
would
take
no
certain
shape
there
crowded
upon
him
recollections
of
busy
autumn
days
when
the
grain
harvest
overtook
the
belated
and
men
toiled
till
late
in
the
fields
of
long
nights
in
the
springtime
when
he
tugged
at
the
and
felt
the
mackerel
slipping
and
flapping
past
his
feet
in
the
darkness
of
the
longer
winter
nights
when
he
joined
the
gatherings
of
the
boys
and
girls
to
dance
jigs
and
reels
on
the
earthen
floor
of
some
kitchen
it
seemed
now
that
all
this
was
past
and
over
for
him
holiday
time
would
bring
him
back
to
carrowkeel
but
would
it
be
the
same
would
he
be
the
same
he
looked
at
his
father
half
hoping
for
sympathy
but
the
old
man
sat
gazing
it
seemed
to
hyacinth
stupidly
into
the
fire
he
wondered
if
his
father
had
forgotten
that
this
was
their
last
evening
together
then
suddenly
without
raising
his
eyes
the
old
man
began
to
speak
and
it
appeared
that
he
too
was
thinking
of
the
change
do
not
know
my
son
what
they
will
teach
you
in
their
school
of
divinity
i
have
long
ago
forgotten
all
i
learned
there
and
i
have
not
missed
the
knowledge
it
does
not
seem
to
me
now
that
what
they
taught
me
has
been
of
any
help
in
getting
to
know
he
paused
for
a
long
time
hyacinth
was
familiar
enough
with
his
ways
of
speech
to
know
that
the
emphatic
meant
the
god
whom
he
worshipped
is
i
am
sure
only
one
way
in
which
we
can
become
his
friends
are
they
which
have
come
out
of
great
tribulation
you
remember
that
hyacinth
that
is
the
only
way
you
may
be
taught
truths
about
him
but
they
matter
very
little
you
have
already
great
thoughts
burning
thoughts
but
they
will
not
of
themselves
bring
you
to
him
the
other
way
is
the
only
way
shall
i
wish
it
for
you
my
son
shall
i
give
it
to
you
for
my
blessing
may
great
tribulation
come
upon
you
in
your
life
tribulation
see
how
weak
my
faith
is
even
now
at
the
very
end
i
can
not
give
you
this
blessing
although
i
know
very
well
that
it
is
the
only
way
i
know
this
because
i
have
been
along
this
way
myself
and
it
has
led
me
to
again
he
paused
it
did
not
seem
to
hyacinth
to
be
possible
to
say
anything
he
was
not
sure
in
his
heart
that
the
friendship
of
the
man
of
sorrows
was
so
well
worth
having
that
he
would
be
content
to
pay
for
it
by
accepting
such
a
benediction
from
his
father
shall
do
this
for
you
hyacinth
i
shall
pray
that
when
the
choice
is
given
you
the
great
choice
between
what
is
easy
and
what
is
hard
the
right
decision
may
be
made
for
you
i
do
not
know
in
what
form
it
will
come
perhaps
it
will
be
as
it
was
with
me
he
made
the
choice
for
me
for
indeed
i
could
not
have
chosen
for
myself
he
set
my
feet
upon
the
narrow
way
forced
me
along
it
for
a
while
and
now
at
the
end
i
see
his
hyacinth
had
heard
enough
of
the
brief
bliss
of
his
married
life
to
understand
he
caught
for
the
first
time
a
glimpse
of
the
meaning
of
the
solitary
life
the
long
prayers
and
the
meditations
he
was
profoundly
moved
but
it
did
not
even
then
seem
to
him
desirable
to
choose
such
a
way
or
to
have
such
attainment
thrust
on
him
next
morning
the
autumn
sunlight
chased
the
recollection
of
his
emotion
from
his
mind
the
fishermen
stopped
his
car
as
he
drove
through
the
street
to
shake
hands
with
him
their
wives
shouted
familiar
blessings
from
the
cabin
doors
father
moran
came
to
the
gate
of
his
presbytery
garden
and
waved
a
farewell
chapter
ii
there
is
that
about
the
material
fabric
the
actual
stone
and
mortar
of
trinity
college
dublin
which
makes
a
vivid
appeal
to
the
imagination
of
the
common
man
the
cultured
sentimentalist
will
not
indeed
be
able
to
lave
his
soul
in
tepid
emotion
while
he
walks
through
these
quadrangles
as
he
may
among
the
cloisters
and
chapels
of
the
oxford
colleges
the
amateur
of
the
past
can
not
here
stand
at
gaze
before
any
single
building
as
he
does
before
the
front
of
oriel
tracing
in
imagination
the
footsteps
of
newman
or
arnold
yet
to
the
average
man
and
far
more
to
the
newly
emancipated
schoolboy
trinity
college
dublin
makes
an
appeal
which
can
hardly
be
ignored
in
oxford
and
cambridge
town
and
university
are
mixed
together
shops
jostle
and
elbow
colleges
in
the
streets
in
dublin
a
man
leaves
the
city
behind
him
when
he
enters
the
college
passes
completely
out
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
university
when
he
steps
on
to
the
pavement
the
physical
contrast
is
striking
enough
appealing
to
the
ear
and
the
eye
the
rattle
of
the
traffic
the
jangling
of
cart
bells
the
inarticulate
babel
of
voices
suddenly
cease
when
the
archway
of
the
great
is
passed
an
immense
silence
takes
their
place
there
is
no
longer
any
need
for
watchfulness
nor
risk
of
being
hustled
by
the
hurrying
crowds
instead
of
footway
and
street
crossing
there
are
broad
walks
untrodden
stretches
of
smooth
grass
the
heavy
campanile
is
in
front
and
heights
of
gray
building
frown
down
on
each
side
it
needs
no
education
not
even
any
imagination
to
appreciate
the
change
it
is
not
necessary
to
know
that
great
scholars
inhabited
the
place
to
recall
any
name
or
any
career
the
appeal
is
not
to
a
recollected
impression
of
the
middle
ages
or
indeed
of
any
past
remote
or
near
it
is
the
spirit
of
scholarship
itself
abstract
intangible
which
creates
this
atmosphere
knowledge
a
severe
goddess
awes
while
she
beckons
hyacinth
conneally
had
submitted
himself
to
such
emotions
time
after
time
when
fresh
from
the
wilds
of
connemara
he
made
his
way
to
the
an
outside
student
in
a
borrowed
cap
and
gown
now
when
for
the
first
time
he
entered
into
the
actual
life
of
the
college
could
look
up
at
windows
of
rooms
that
were
his
own
and
reckon
on
his
privilege
of
fingering
tomes
from
the
shelves
of
the
huge
library
the
spirit
of
the
place
awed
him
anew
he
neither
analyzed
nor
attempted
an
expression
of
what
he
felt
but
his
first
night
within
the
walls
was
restless
because
of
the
inspiration
which
filled
him
yet
this
college
does
not
fail
to
make
an
appeal
also
to
the
thinking
mind
only
it
is
a
strange
appeal
tending
to
sadness
the
sudden
silence
after
the
tumult
of
the
streets
has
come
for
some
minds
to
be
the
symbol
of
a
divorce
between
the
knowledge
within
and
the
life
without
and
this
is
not
the
separation
which
must
always
exist
between
thought
and
action
the
gulf
fixed
between
the
student
and
the
merchant
it
is
a
real
divorce
between
the
nation
and
the
university
between
the
two
kinds
of
life
which
ought
like
man
and
woman
to
complete
each
other
through
their
very
diversity
but
here
have
gone
hopelessly
apart
never
once
through
all
the
centuries
of
struggle
to
express
herself
has
the
university
felt
the
throb
of
her
life
it
is
true
that
greatest
patriots
from
swift
to
davis
have
been
her
children
but
she
has
never
understood
their
spirit
never
looked
on
them
as
anything
but
strangers
to
her
family
they
have
been
to
her
stray
robber
wasps
to
be
driven
from
the
hive
while
to
the
others
they
have
seemed
cygnets
among
her
duckling
brood
it
is
very
wonderful
that
the
university
alone
has
been
able
to
resist
the
glamour
of
past
and
has
failed
to
admire
the
persistency
of
her
nationality
there
has
surely
been
enough
in
every
century
that
has
passed
since
the
college
was
founded
to
win
it
over
from
alien
thought
and
the
ideals
of
the
foreigner
all
this
hyacinth
came
to
feel
afterwards
and
learnt
in
bitterness
of
spirit
to
be
angry
at
the
isolation
from
irish
life
at
first
quite
other
thoughts
crowded
upon
his
mind
he
felt
a
rebellion
against
his
estimate
of
what
he
was
to
learn
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
come
into
vital
touch
with
the
greatest
life
of
all
he
was
to
join
the
ranks
of
those
who
besieged
the
ears
of
god
for
knowledge
and
left
behind
them
to
successors
yet
unborn
great
traditions
of
the
enigmas
they
had
guessed
in
entering
upon
the
study
of
theology
he
seemed
to
become
a
soldier
in
the
sacred
band
the
élite
of
the
army
which
won
and
guarded
truth
already
he
was
convinced
that
there
could
be
no
greater
science
than
the
divine
one
no
more
inspiring
moment
in
life
than
this
one
when
he
took
his
first
step
towards
the
knowledge
of
god
he
crossed
the
quadrangle
with
his
mind
full
of
such
thoughts
and
joined
a
group
of
students
round
the
door
of
one
of
the
it
did
not
shock
his
sense
of
fitness
that
some
of
his
in
the
great
science
wore
shabby
clothes
or
that
others
scorned
the
use
of
a
razor
bred
as
he
had
been
at
home
he
felt
no
incongruity
between
dirty
collars
and
the
study
of
divinity
it
was
not
until
he
caught
scraps
of
conversation
that
he
experienced
an
awakening
from
his
dream
one
eager
group
surrounded
a
foreseeing
youth
who
had
written
the
dates
of
the
first
four
general
councils
of
the
church
upon
his
them
out
like
a
good
man
said
one
on
a
minute
said
another
i
see
if
i
have
got
them
right
i
ground
them
up
specially
this
morning
nicæa
no
hang
it
the
number
of
bishops
who
were
present
was
the
date
it
was
the
row
about
at
chalcedon
asked
a
tall
pale
youth
some
monk
or
other
go
for
cyril
of
alexandria
be
stuck
anyhow
tommy
said
a
neat
dapper
little
man
with
a
very
ragged
gown
hyacinth
slipped
past
the
group
and
approached
two
better
dressed
students
who
stood
apart
from
the
others
this
he
asked
the
entrance
examination
to
the
divinity
school
is
to
be
held
for
answer
he
received
a
curt
and
a
stare
apparently
his
suit
of
brown
connemara
homespun
did
not
commend
him
to
these
aristocrats
they
turned
their
backs
on
him
and
resumed
their
conversation
was
walking
up
and
down
the
pier
listening
to
the
band
with
two
of
the
rankest
outsiders
you
ever
set
eyes
on
medicals
out
of
paddy
of
course
i
could
do
nothing
else
but
break
it
you
were
engaged
to
her
then
i
i
was
and
i
anyhow
i
thought
it
better
to
have
a
clear
understanding
she
came
up
to
me
outside
the
door
of
on
sunday
afternoon
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
bob
says
she
seen
you
for
name
said
i
just
like
that
as
cool
as
you
please
i
could
see
she
felt
it
called
you
bob
says
she
very
red
in
the
face
called
me
maimie
ever
since
we
went
to
together
and
not
going
to
begin
calling
you
banks
now
my
so
you
think
it
it
was
a
relief
to
hyacinth
when
he
was
tapped
on
the
arm
by
a
boy
with
a
very
pimply
face
who
thrust
a
paper
into
his
hand
and
distracted
his
attention
from
the
final
discomfiture
of
maimie
which
banks
was
recounting
in
a
clear
voice
as
if
he
wished
everyone
in
the
neighbourhood
to
hear
it
hope
come
said
the
boy
all
in
the
paper
the
held
every
wednesday
morning
at
nine
sharp
special
meeting
hyacinth
was
bewildered
there
was
something
quite
unfamiliar
in
this
prompt
and
advertisement
of
prayer
the
student
with
the
papers
began
to
be
doubtful
of
him
not
high
church
are
you
he
asked
not
we
have
printed
offices
with
verses
and
responds
and
that
sort
of
thing
we
have
extempore
prayer
by
members
of
the
not
high
church
said
hyacinth
least
i
think
not
i
really
know
much
about
these
things
be
very
glad
to
go
to
your
right
said
the
other
are
welcome
there
will
be
special
prayer
for
the
success
of
the
british
arms
i
suppose
you
heard
that
old
kruger
has
sent
an
ultimatum
there
will
be
war
at
there
was
a
sudden
movement
among
the
students
gowns
were
pulled
straight
and
caps
adjusted
he
comes
said
someone
henry
the
divinity
professor
crossed
the
square
rapidly
he
was
a
man
stout
almost
ponderous
in
figure
but
he
held
himself
rigidly
upright
and
walked
fast
across
the
square
the
extreme
neatness
of
his
clothes
contrasted
with
the
prevailing
shabbiness
of
the
students
and
the
assistant
lecturers
who
followed
him
yet
he
did
not
seem
to
be
a
man
who
gave
to
externals
more
than
their
due
share
of
consideration
his
broad
forehead
gave
promise
of
great
intellectual
power
a
promise
half
belied
by
the
narrow
gray
eyes
beneath
it
these
were
eyes
which
might
see
keenly
and
would
certainly
see
things
just
as
they
are
though
they
were
not
likely
to
catch
any
glimpse
of
that
greater
world
where
objects
can
not
be
focussed
sharply
yet
in
them
an
odd
contradiction
there
lurked
a
possibility
of
humorous
twinkling
the
man
was
capable
perhaps
of
the
broad
tolerance
of
the
great
humorist
certainly
of
very
acute
perception
of
minor
incongruities
his
thin
lips
were
habitually
pressed
together
giving
a
suggestion
of
strength
to
the
set
of
his
mouth
a
man
with
such
a
mouth
can
think
and
act
but
not
feel
either
passionately
or
enduringly
he
will
direct
men
because
he
knows
his
own
mind
but
is
not
likely
to
sway
them
because
he
will
always
be
master
of
himself
and
will
not
become
enslaved
to
any
great
enthusiasm
the
students
trooped
into
the
hall
and
the
examination
began
the
assistant
lecturers
helped
in
the
work
each
student
was
called
up
in
turn
asked
a
few
questions
and
given
a
portion
of
the
greek
testament
to
translate
for
the
most
part
their
capacities
were
known
beforehand
there
were
some
who
had
won
honours
in
their
university
course
before
entering
the
divinity
school
for
them
the
examiners
were
all
smiles
and
the
business
of
the
day
was
understood
to
be
perfunctory
others
were
recognised
as
mere
pass
men
whom
it
was
necessary
to
spur
to
some
exertion
a
few
like
hyacinth
were
unknown
these
were
the
poorer
students
who
had
not
been
able
to
afford
to
reside
at
the
university
sooner
than
was
absolutely
necessary
their
knowledge
generally
scanty
was
received
by
the
examiners
with
undisguised
contempt
it
fell
to
lot
to
present
himself
to
henry
he
did
so
tremulously
the
professor
inquired
his
name
and
looked
him
over
coldly
for
me
he
said
handing
him
a
greek
testament
the
passage
marked
was
great
description
of
charity
it
was
very
familiar
to
hyacinth
and
he
read
it
with
a
serious
feeling
for
the
words
henry
who
at
first
had
occupied
himself
with
some
figures
on
a
sheet
of
paper
looked
up
and
listened
attentively
were
you
at
school
he
asked
taught
you
greek
father
taught
me
you
have
got
a
very
peculiar
pronunciation
and
made
an
extraordinary
number
of
mistakes
in
accentuation
and
quantity
but
read
as
if
paul
meant
something
now
have
given
me
he
said
when
hyacinth
had
finished
authorized
version
word
for
word
can
you
do
no
better
than
that
can
do
it
differently
said
hyacinth
you
know
any
greek
outside
of
the
new
testament
hyacinth
repeated
a
few
lines
from
homer
book
of
the
is
not
in
the
college
course
said
henry
did
you
come
to
read
it
hyacinth
had
no
explanation
to
give
he
had
read
the
book
it
seemed
without
being
forced
and
without
hope
of
getting
a
prize
he
recited
it
as
if
he
liked
it
the
remainder
of
the
examination
disclosed
the
fact
that
he
was
lamentably
deficient
in
the
rudiments
of
greek
grammar
and
had
the
very
vaguest
ideas
of
the
history
of
the
church
afterwards
professor
henry
discussed
the
new
class
with
his
assistants
as
they
crossed
the
square
together
usual
lot
said
spenser
a
dozen
scholars
perhaps
one
man
among
them
with
real
brains
the
rest
are
either
idlers
or
what
is
worse
hit
on
one
man
with
brains
said
henry
thompson
i
suppose
i
saw
that
you
took
him
he
did
well
in
his
degree
said
henry
man
i
mean
has
more
brains
than
thompson
a
man
i
never
heard
of
before
his
name
is
conneally
he
looks
as
if
he
came
up
from
the
wilds
somewhere
he
has
hands
like
an
agricultural
labourer
and
a
brogue
that
i
fancy
comes
from
galway
but
a
man
to
keep
an
eye
on
he
may
do
something
if
he
go
off
the
lines
we
must
try
and
lick
him
into
shape
a
hyacinth
conneally
knew
extremely
little
about
the
politics
foreign
or
domestic
of
the
english
nation
his
father
neither
read
newspapers
nor
cared
to
discuss
such
rumours
of
the
doings
of
governments
as
happened
to
reach
carrowkeel
on
the
other
hand
he
knew
a
good
deal
about
the
history
of
ireland
and
the
english
were
still
for
him
the
whom
keating
describes
his
intercourse
with
the
fishermen
and
peasants
of
the
galway
seaboard
had
intensified
his
vague
dislike
of
the
series
of
oscillations
between
bullying
and
bribery
which
make
up
the
story
of
latest
attempts
to
govern
ireland
without
in
the
least
understanding
the
reasons
for
the
war
in
south
africa
he
felt
a
strong
sympathy
with
the
boers
to
him
they
seemed
a
small
people
doomed
if
they
failed
to
defend
themselves
to
something
like
the
treatment
which
ireland
had
received
it
was
therefore
with
surprise
almost
with
horror
that
he
listened
for
the
first
time
to
the
superlative
imperialism
of
the
protestant
unionist
party
when
he
attended
the
to
which
he
had
been
invited
the
room
was
well
filled
with
students
who
joined
heartily
in
the
singing
of
christian
soldiers
a
hymn
selected
as
appropriate
for
the
occasion
an
address
by
the
chairman
a
dublin
clergyman
followed
according
to
this
gentleman
the
boers
were
a
but
hypocritical
nation
addicted
to
england
on
the
other
hand
was
the
pioneer
of
civilization
and
the
of
missionary
enterprise
it
was
therefore
clear
that
all
good
christians
ought
to
pray
for
the
success
of
the
british
arms
the
speech
bewildered
rather
than
irritated
hyacinth
the
mind
gasps
for
a
time
when
immersed
suddenly
in
an
entirely
new
view
of
things
and
requires
time
to
adjust
itself
for
pleasure
or
revolt
just
as
the
body
does
when
plunged
into
cold
water
it
had
never
previously
occurred
to
him
that
an
irishman
could
regard
england
as
anything
but
a
pirate
anger
rapidly
succeeded
his
surprise
while
he
listened
to
the
prayers
which
followed
it
was
apparently
open
to
any
student
present
to
give
utterance
as
occasion
offered
to
his
desires
and
a
large
number
of
young
men
availed
themselves
of
the
opportunity
some
spoke
briefly
and
haltingly
some
laboriously
attempted
to
adapt
the
phraseology
of
the
to
the
sentiment
of
the
moment
a
few
had
the
gift
of
rapid
and
even
eloquent
supplication
these
last
were
the
hardest
to
endure
they
prefaced
their
requests
with
fantastic
eulogies
of
righteousness
designed
apparently
for
the
edification
of
the
audience
present
in
the
flesh
for
they
invariably
began
by
assuring
the
almighty
that
he
was
well
aware
of
the
facts
and
generally
apologized
to
him
for
recapitulating
them
anger
increased
as
he
heard
the
fervent
groans
which
expressed
the
unanimous
conviction
of
the
justice
of
the
petitions
no
one
seemed
to
think
it
possible
that
the
right
could
be
on
the
other
side
when
the
meeting
was
over
the
secretary
whose
name
it
appeared
was
mackenzie
greeted
hyacinth
warmly
to
have
you
with
us
he
said
hope
always
come
i
shall
be
delighted
to
propose
you
as
a
member
of
the
union
subscription
one
shilling
to
defray
necessary
expenses
in
any
case
whether
you
subscribe
or
not
we
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
with
shall
never
come
again
said
hyacinth
mackenzie
drew
back
astonished
not
you
like
the
meeting
i
thought
it
was
capital
so
informal
and
hearty
you
think
it
was
hearty
but
perhaps
you
are
high
church
are
you
hyacinth
remembered
that
this
identical
question
had
been
put
to
him
the
day
before
by
the
boy
who
distributed
leaflets
he
wondered
vaguely
at
the
importance
which
attached
to
the
nickname
am
not
sure
he
said
i
quite
know
what
you
mean
you
see
i
have
only
just
entered
the
divinity
school
and
i
hardly
know
anything
about
theology
what
is
a
high
churchman
it
require
any
theology
to
know
that
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
a
high
churchman
is
well
of
course
a
high
churchman
sings
gregorian
chants
you
know
and
puts
flowers
on
the
altar
more
than
that
of
course
in
fact
a
high
churchman
he
paused
and
then
added
with
an
air
of
victorious
conviction
anyhow
if
you
were
high
church
you
would
be
sure
to
know
well
said
hyacinth
turning
to
leave
the
room
know
anything
about
it
so
i
suppose
not
high
mackenzie
however
was
not
going
to
allow
him
to
escape
so
easily
on
a
minute
if
not
high
church
why
you
come
to
our
meetings
i
join
in
your
prayers
when
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
england
ought
to
lord
said
mackenzie
it
is
possible
to
startle
even
the
secretary
of
a
prayer
union
into
mild
profanity
mean
to
tell
me
you
are
a
and
you
a
divinity
student
it
had
not
hitherto
struck
hyacinth
that
it
was
impossible
to
combine
a
sufficient
orthodoxy
with
a
doubt
about
the
invariable
righteousness
of
quarrels
afterwards
he
came
to
understand
the
matter
better
chapter
iii
mackenzie
was
not
at
heart
an
man
and
he
would
have
repudiated
with
indignation
the
charge
of
being
a
he
felt
after
his
conversation
with
hyacinth
much
as
most
men
would
if
they
discovered
an
unsuspected
case
of
among
their
acquaintances
his
first
duty
was
to
warn
the
society
in
which
he
moved
of
the
existence
of
a
dangerous
man
a
violent
and
wicked
rebel
he
repeated
a
slightly
exaggerated
version
of
what
hyacinth
had
said
to
everyone
he
met
the
pleasurable
sense
of
personal
importance
which
comes
with
having
a
story
to
tell
grew
upon
him
and
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
day
in
seeking
out
fresh
confidants
to
swell
the
chorus
of
his
commination
in
england
at
the
time
public
opinion
was
roused
to
a
fever
heat
of
patriotic
enthusiasm
and
the
irish
protestant
unionists
were
eager
to
outdo
even
the
in
imperialist
sentiment
the
students
of
trinity
college
being
then
as
ever
the
or
boys
of
irish
loyalty
it
is
easy
to
imagine
how
name
was
whispered
shudderingly
in
the
of
the
library
how
his
sentiments
were
anathematized
in
the
at
commons
how
plots
were
hatched
for
the
chastisement
of
his
iniquity
over
the
fire
in
the
evenings
when
pipes
were
lit
and
tea
was
brewed
at
the
end
of
the
week
hyacinth
was
in
an
exceedingly
uncomfortable
position
outside
the
nobody
would
speak
to
him
inside
he
found
himself
the
solitary
occupant
of
the
bench
he
sat
on
a
position
of
comparative
physical
comfort
for
the
other
seats
were
crowded
but
not
otherwise
desirable
a
great
english
poet
had
just
composed
a
poem
which
a
musician
no
doubt
equally
eminent
had
set
to
a
noble
tune
it
embodied
an
appeal
for
funds
for
purposes
not
clearly
specified
and
hazarded
the
experiment
of
rhyming
with
son
which
in
less
fervent
times
might
have
provoked
the
criticism
of
the
captious
it
became
the
fashion
in
college
to
chant
this
martial
ode
whenever
hyacinth
was
seen
approaching
it
was
thundered
out
by
a
choir
who
marched
in
step
up
and
down
his
staircase
bars
of
it
were
softly
hummed
in
his
ear
while
he
tried
to
note
the
important
truths
which
the
lecturers
impressed
upon
their
classes
one
night
five
musicians
relieved
each
other
at
the
task
of
playing
the
tune
on
a
concertina
outside
his
door
they
commenced
briskly
at
eight
in
the
evening
and
the
final
sleepy
version
only
died
away
at
six
the
next
morning
henry
who
either
did
not
know
or
chose
to
ignore
the
state
of
the
feelings
advised
hyacinth
to
become
a
member
of
the
theological
debating
society
the
election
to
membership
he
said
was
a
mere
form
and
nobody
was
ever
excluded
hyacinth
sent
his
name
to
the
secretary
and
was
blackbeaned
by
an
overwhelming
majority
of
the
members
shortly
afterwards
the
paid
a
visit
to
the
college
and
the
students
seized
the
chance
of
displaying
their
loyalty
to
the
throne
and
constitution
they
assembled
outside
the
library
which
the
representative
of
queen
victoria
was
inspecting
under
the
guidance
of
the
provost
and
two
of
the
senior
fellows
it
is
the
nature
of
the
students
of
trinity
college
to
shout
while
they
wait
for
the
development
of
interesting
events
and
on
this
occasion
even
the
library
walls
were
insufficient
to
exclude
the
noise
the
excellent
nobleman
inside
found
himself
obliged
to
cast
round
for
original
remarks
about
the
manuscript
of
the
of
kells
while
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
verses
which
commemorate
the
departure
of
thousand
fighting
to
table
bay
when
at
length
he
emerged
on
the
library
steps
the
tune
changed
as
was
right
and
proper
to
save
the
strangely
enough
hyacinth
had
never
before
heard
the
national
anthem
it
is
not
played
or
sung
often
by
the
natives
of
connemara
and
although
the
ocean
certainly
forms
part
of
the
british
empire
the
atlantic
waves
have
not
yet
learned
to
beat
out
this
particular
melody
so
it
happened
that
hyacinth
without
meaning
to
be
offensive
omitted
the
ceremony
of
removing
his
hat
a
neighbour
joyful
at
the
opportunity
snatched
the
offending
garment
and
skimmed
it
far
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
a
few
hard
kicks
awakened
hyacinth
more
effectually
to
a
sense
of
his
crime
and
it
was
with
a
torn
coat
and
many
bruises
that
he
escaped
in
the
end
to
the
shelter
of
his
rooms
less
inclined
to
be
loyal
than
when
he
left
them
after
a
few
weeks
it
became
clear
that
the
british
armies
in
south
africa
were
not
going
to
reap
that
rich
and
unvarying
crop
of
victories
which
the
valour
of
the
soldiers
and
the
ability
of
the
generals
deserved
the
indomitable
spirit
of
the
great
nation
rose
to
the
occasion
and
the
position
of
those
who
entertained
doubts
about
the
justice
of
the
original
quarrel
became
more
than
ever
unbearable
hyacinth
took
to
wandering
by
himself
through
parts
of
the
city
in
which
he
was
unlikely
to
meet
any
of
his
his
soul
grew
bitter
within
him
the
course
of
petty
persecution
to
which
he
was
subjected
hardened
his
original
sentimental
sympathy
with
the
boer
cause
into
a
clearly
defined
hatred
of
everything
english
when
he
got
clear
of
the
college
and
the
hateful
sound
of
the
son
tune
he
tramped
along
gloating
quietly
over
the
news
of
the
latest
he
was
very
lonely
and
friendless
for
not
even
the
discomfiture
of
his
enemies
can
make
up
to
a
young
man
for
the
want
of
a
friend
to
speak
to
an
inexpressible
longing
for
home
came
over
him
there
was
a
shop
in
a
which
exposed
photographs
of
galway
scenery
in
its
windows
for
a
time
hyacinth
used
to
go
day
by
day
to
gaze
at
them
the
modest
front
of
the
gaelic
league
hyce
was
another
haunt
of
his
he
used
to
stand
debating
his
eyes
on
the
irish
titles
of
the
books
in
the
window
and
repeating
the
words
he
read
aloud
to
himself
until
the
turned
to
look
at
him
once
he
entered
a
dingy
shop
merely
because
the
name
was
posted
over
the
door
in
gaelic
characters
it
was
one
of
those
shops
to
be
found
in
the
back
streets
of
most
large
towns
which
devote
themselves
to
a
composite
business
displaying
newspapers
apples
tobacco
and
sweets
for
sale
the
afternoon
light
already
growing
feeble
in
the
open
air
had
almost
deserted
the
interior
of
the
shop
at
first
hyacinth
saw
nothing
but
an
untidy
girl
reading
in
a
corner
by
the
light
of
a
candle
he
asked
her
for
cigarettes
she
rose
and
laid
her
book
and
the
candle
on
the
counter
it
was
one
of
irish
primers
dirty
and
pencilled
heart
warmed
to
her
at
once
was
she
not
trying
to
learn
the
dear
irish
which
the
barefooted
girls
far
away
at
home
shouted
to
each
other
as
they
dragged
the
seaweed
up
from
the
shore
then
from
the
far
end
of
the
shop
he
heard
a
voice
speaking
irish
it
was
not
the
soft
liquid
tongue
of
the
connaught
peasants
but
a
language
more
regular
and
formal
the
man
spoke
it
as
if
it
were
a
language
he
had
learned
comparatively
slowly
and
with
effort
yet
the
sound
of
it
seemed
to
hyacinth
one
of
the
sweetest
things
he
had
ever
heard
not
even
the
shrinking
which
he
had
been
taught
by
repeated
snubbings
and
protracted
ostracism
could
prevent
him
from
making
himself
known
to
this
stranger
blessing
of
god
upon
ireland
he
said
there
was
not
a
hesitation
on
the
part
of
the
stranger
the
sound
of
the
gaelic
was
enough
for
him
he
stretched
out
both
hands
to
hyacinth
it
that
you
also
are
one
of
us
one
of
the
gaels
he
asked
hyacinth
seized
the
outstretched
hands
and
held
them
tight
the
feeling
of
offered
friendship
and
companionship
warmed
him
with
a
sudden
glow
he
felt
that
his
eyes
were
filling
with
tears
and
that
his
voice
would
break
if
he
tried
to
speak
but
he
did
not
care
at
all
he
poured
out
a
long
gaelic
greeting
scarcely
knowing
what
he
said
perhaps
neither
the
man
whose
hands
he
held
nor
the
owner
of
the
shop
behind
the
counter
fully
understood
him
but
they
guessed
at
his
feelings
it
that
you
are
a
stranger
here
and
lonely
where
is
your
home
what
name
is
there
on
you
i
am
a
stranger
indeed
and
lonely
too
said
hyacinth
are
a
stranger
no
longer
then
we
are
all
of
us
friends
with
each
other
you
speak
our
own
dear
tongue
and
that
is
enough
to
make
us
the
tobacconist
it
appeared
also
spoke
irish
of
a
kind
he
cast
occasional
remarks
into
the
conversation
which
followed
less
it
seemed
to
hyacinth
with
a
view
of
giving
expression
to
any
thought
than
for
the
sake
of
airing
some
phrases
which
he
had
somewhat
inadequately
learned
indeed
it
struck
hyacinth
very
soon
that
his
new
friend
was
getting
rather
out
of
his
depth
in
his
dear
at
last
the
tobacconist
said
with
a
smile
afraid
we
must
ask
conneally
you
say
that
conneally
was
your
name
to
speak
the
beurla
clean
beaten
with
the
gaelic
and
you
go
much
further
yourself
cahal
that
the
truth
small
blame
to
me
said
cahal
in
english
charles
maguire
all
what
am
i
but
a
learner
and
clear
that
conneally
has
spoken
it
since
ever
he
spoke
at
hyacinth
smiled
and
nodded
maguire
went
on
are
you
doing
this
afternoon
what
do
you
say
to
coming
round
with
me
to
see
mary

on
my
way

hyacinth

her
house

said
maguire
cheerfully
allows
me
to
bring
anyone

to
see
her
she
likes
to
know
anyone
who
loves
ireland
and
speaks
gaelic
perhaps
meet
finola
too
often
who
what
we
call
miss
goold
augusta
goold
you
know
we
call
her
finola
because
she
shelters
the
rest
of
us
under
her
wings
when
the
moyle
gets
tempestuous
you
remember
the
story
course
i
do
said
hyacinth
who
had
learnt
the
tale
of
daughter
as
other
children
do
jack
the
who
is
miss
she
writes
verses
surely
you
know
them
hyacinth
shook
his
head
a
pity
we
all
admire
them
immensely
she
has
something
nearly
every
week
in
the
she
has
just
brought
out
a
volume
of
lyrics
her
brother
worked
the
publishing
of
it
in
new
york
he
is
mixed
up
with
literary
people
there
you
must
have
heard
of
him
at
all
events
patrick
one
of
the
few
who
stood
by
when
he
fought
the
priests
he
gave
up
the
parliamentary
people
after
that
no
honest
man
could
do
anything
he
conducted
hyacinth
to
one
of
the
old
squares
on
the
north
side
of
the
city
when
the
tide
of
fashion
set
southwards
spreading
terraces
and
villas
from
leeson
street
to
killiney
it
left
behind
some
of
the
finest
houses
in
dublin
nowadays
for
a
comparatively
low
rent
it
is
possible
to
live
in
a
splendid
house
if
you
do
not
aspire
to
the
glory
of
a
smart
address
miss
house
for
instance
boasted
a
spacious
hall
and
lofty
with
impressive
ceilings
and
handsome
fireplaces
yet
she
paid
for
it
little
more
than
half
the
rent
which
a
cramped
villa
in
clyde
road
would
have
cost
her
even
so
it
was
somewhat
of
a
mystery
to
her
friends
how
miss
managed
to
live
there
a
solicitor
who
had
his
offices
on
the
probably
paid
the
rent
of
the
whole
house
but
the
profits
of
are
small
and
a
poetess
like
meaner
women
requires
food
clothes
and
fire
indeed
miss
no
longer
whose
verses
adorned
the
but
served
an
english
paper
as
irish
correspondent
it
was
a
pity
that
a
pen
certainly
capable
of
better
things
should
have
been
employed
in
describing
the
newest
costume
of
the
lord
wife
at
punchestown
or
the
confection
of
tulle
which
draped
round
chesney
adorned
a
castle
ball
miss
herself
was
heartily
ashamed
of
the
work
but
it
was
or
appeared
to
her
to
be
necessary
to
live
and
even
with
the
aid
of
occasional
remittances
from
patrick
in
new
york
she
could
scarcely
have
afforded
her
friends
a
cup
of
tea
without
the
guineas
earned
by
torturing
the
english
language
in
a
weekly
chronicle
of
irish
clothes
even
with
the
help
of
such
earnings
poverty
was
for
ever
tapping
her
on
the
shoulder
and
no
one
except
mary
herself
and
her
one
knew
how
carefully
fire
and
light
had
to
be
economized
in
the
splendid
rooms
where
an
extinct
aristocracy
had
held
revels
a
century
before
hyacinth
and
his
friend
advanced
past
the
doors
and
up
the
broad
staircase
as
far
as
the
for
a
time
they
got
no
further
than
the
threshold
the
opening
of
the
door
was
greeted
with
a
and
emphatic
from
the
company
within
maguire
laid
his
hand
on
arm
and
the
two
stood
still
looking
into
the
room
what
was
left
of
the
feeble
autumn
twilight
was
almost
excluded
by
curtains
no
lamp
was
lit
and
the
fire
cast
only
fitful
rays
here
and
there
through
the
room
it
was
with
difficulty
that
hyacinth
discerned
figures
in
a
semicircle
and
a
slim
woman
in
a
white
dress
standing
apart
from
the
others
near
the
fire
then
he
heard
a
voice
a
singularly
sweet
voice
as
it
seemed
to
him
reciting
with
steady
emphasis
on
the
syllables
which
marked
the
rhythm
of
the
poem
there
in
the
west
where
the
heavy
gray
clouds
are
insistent
where
the
sky
stoops
to
gather
the
earth
into
mournful
embraces
where
the
country
lies
saturate
sodden
round
saturate
hamlets
there
in
the
sunset
where
rages
and
surges
atlantic
and
the
salt
is
commingled
with
rain
over
desolate
beaches
thy
heart
o
beloved
is
still
beating
fitfully
feebly
beating
ah
not
as
it
beat
in
the
squadrons
of
sarafield
exultantly
joyously
gladly
expectant
of
battle
with
throbs
like
the
notes
of
the
drums
when
men
gather
for
fighting
still
but
ah
not
as
it
beat
in
the
latest
fitzgerald
nobly
devote
to
his
most
noble
tradition
or
in
emmet
or
davis
or
last
on
their
list
in
fitfully
feebly
o
desolate
mother
o
erin
when
shall
the
pulse
of
thy
life
which
but
flutters
in
connaucht
throb
through
thy
meadows
and
boglands
and
mountains
and
cities
a
subdued
murmur
of
applause
greeted
the
close
of
the
recitation
and
praise
more
sincere
than
that
with
which
politeness
generally
greets
the
performances
of
minor
poets
hyacinth
joined
in
neither
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
verses
were
too
beautiful
to
speak
about
so
sacred
that
praise
was
a
kind
of
sacrilege
perhaps
some
excuse
may
be
found
for
his
emotion
in
the
fact
that
for
weeks
he
had
heard
no
poetry
except
the
ode
about
something
off
a
the
violence
of
the
contrast
benumbed
his
critical
faculty
so
a
man
who
was
obliged
to
gaze
for
a
long
time
at
the
new
churches
erected
in
belfast
might
afterwards
catch
himself
in
the
act
of
admiring
the
houses
which
the
congested
districts
board
builds
in
connaught
am
afraid
i
must
have
bored
it
was
miss
who
greeted
him
see
you
and
maguire
come
in
until
i
had
commenced
my
poor
little
poem
i
ought
to
have
given
you
some
tea
before
i
inflicted
it
on
said
hyacinth
was
beautiful
is
it
really
your
own
did
you
write
it
miss
flushed
the
vehement
sincerity
of
his
tone
embarrassed
her
though
she
was
accustomed
to
praise
are
very
kind
she
said
my
friends
here
are
far
too
kind
to
me
but
come
now
i
must
give
you
some
the
tea
was
nearly
stone
cold
and
weak
with
frequent
waterings
the
saucer
and
spoon
possibly
even
the
cup
had
been
used
by
someone
else
before
maguire
secured
for
himself
the
last
remaining
morsel
of
cake
leaving
hyacinth
the
choice
between
a
gingerbread
biscuit
and
a
torn
slice
of
bread
and
butter
none
of
these
things
appeared
to
embarrass
miss
they
did
not
matter
in
the
least
to
hyacinth
you
know
the
west
well
he
asked
i
do
not
always
longed
to
go
and
spend
a
whole
long
summer
there
but
never
had
the
how
did
you
know
it
was
like
that
i
mean
how
did
you
catch
the
spirit
of
it
in
your
poem
i
she
said
am
so
glad
but
i
deserve
any
credit
for
it
i
wrote
those
verses
after
i
had
been
looking
at
one
of
jim
pictures
you
know
them
of
course
no
oh
but
you
must
go
and
see
them
at
once
if
you
love
the
west
and
you
do
you
is
my
home
said
hyacinth
when
he
had
finished
his
tea
she
introduced
him
to
some
of
the
people
who
were
in
the
room
afterwards
he
came
to
know
them
but
the
memories
which
miss
verses
called
up
in
him
made
him
absent
and
preoccupied
he
scarcely
heard
the
names
she
spoke
soon
the
party
broke
up
and
hyacinth
turned
to
look
for
maguire
afraid
maguire
has
gone
said
miss
has
a
lecture
to
attend
this
afternoon
you
must
come
here
again
conneally
come
next
wednesday
every
wednesday
if
you
like
we
can
have
a
talk
about
the
west
i
shall
want
you
to
tell
me
all
sorts
of
things
perhaps
finola
will
be
here
next
week
she
very
often
comes
i
shall
look
forward
to
introducing
you
to
her
you
are
sure
to
admire
her
immensely
we
all
heard
of
her
said
hyacinth
maguire
told
me
who
she
but
he
have
told
you
half
she
is
magnificent
all
the
rest
of
us
are
only
little
children
compared
to
her
now
be
sure
you
come
and
meet
chapter
iv
ever
since
pitt
and
castlereagh
perpetrated
their
act
of
union
two
political
parties
have
struggled
together
in
ireland
both
of
them
have
been
steadily
prominent
so
prominent
that
they
have
sometimes
attracted
the
attention
of
the
english
public
and
drawn
to
their
contest
a
little
quite
unintelligent
interest
the
simplest
and
most
discernible
line
of
division
between
them
is
a
religious
one
the
protestant
party
has
hitherto
been
guided
and
led
by
the
gentry
it
has
been
steadily
loyal
to
england
and
to
the
english
government
it
has
not
been
greatly
concerned
about
ireland
or
welfare
but
has
been
consistently
anxious
to
preserve
its
own
privileges
powers
and
property
it
has
not
come
well
out
of
the
struggle
of
the
nineteenth
century
its
church
has
been
disestablished
its
privileges
and
powers
abolished
and
the
last
remnants
of
its
property
are
being
filched
from
it
it
is
a
curious
piece
of
irony
that
this
party
should
have
hastened
its
own
defeat
by
the
very
policy
adopted
to
secure
victory
no
doubt
the
irish
aristocracy
would
have
suffered
less
if
they
had
been
seditious
instead
of
loyal
the
roman
catholic
party
has
been
led
by
ecclesiastics
and
has
always
included
the
bulk
of
the
people
its
leaders
have
not
cared
for
the
welfare
of
ireland
any
more
than
the
protestant
party
but
they
have
always
pretended
that
they
did
being
in
this
respect
much
wiser
than
their
opponents
they
have
pulled
the
strings
of
a
whole
series
of
political
movements
and
made
puppets
dance
on
and
off
the
stage
as
they
chose
also
they
have
understood
how
to
deal
with
england
unlike
the
protestant
party
they
have
never
been
loyal
because
they
knew
from
the
first
that
england
gives
most
to
those
who
bully
or
worry
her
they
have
kept
one
object
steadily
in
view
an
object
quite
as
selfish
in
reality
as
that
of
the
aristocracy
the
aggrandisement
of
their
church
for
this
they
have
been
prepared
at
any
time
to
sacrifice
the
interests
of
ireland
and
are
content
at
the
present
moment
to
watch
the
country
bleeding
to
death
with
entire
complacency
the
leaders
of
this
party
enter
upon
the
twentieth
century
in
sight
of
their
promised
land
they
possess
all
the
power
and
nearly
all
the
wealth
of
ireland
if
the
bishops
can
secure
the
continuance
of
english
government
for
the
next
ireland
will
have
become
the
property
her
money
will
go
to
propagating
the
faith
her
children
will
supply
the
world
with
a
superfluity
of
priests
and
nuns
outside
both
parties
there
have
always
been
a
few
men
united
by
no
ties
of
policy
or
religion
unless
as
perhaps
we
may
we
call
patriotism
a
kind
of
religion
other
lands
have
been
loved
sincerely
devotedly
passionately
as
mothers
wives
and
mistresses
are
loved
ireland
alone
has
been
loved
religiously
as
men
are
taught
to
love
god
or
the
saints
her
lovers
have
called
themselves
catholic
or
protestant
such
distinctions
have
not
mattered
to
these
men
they
have
scarcely
ever
been
able
to
form
themselves
into
a
party
never
into
a
strong
or
a
wise
party
they
have
been
violent
desperate
frequently
ridiculous
but
always
sincere
and
unselfish
their
great
weakness
has
lain
in
the
fact
that
they
have
had
no
consistent
aim
some
of
their
leaders
have
looked
for
a
return
to
constitution
and
built
upon
the
watchword
of
the
volunteers
king
the
lords
and
the
commons
of
some
have
dreamed
of
a
complete
independence
of
an
irish
republic
shaping
its
own
world
policy
some
have
wholly
distrusted
politics
and
given
their
strength
to
the
intellectual
spiritual
or
material
regeneration
of
the
people
among
these
men
have
been
found
the
sanest
practical
reformers
and
the
wildest
revolutionary
dreamers
on
the
outskirts
of
their
company
have
hung
all
sorts
of
people
parliamentary
politicians
have
leaned
towards
them
and
been
driven
straightway
out
of
public
life
criminals
have
claimed
fellowship
with
them
and
brought
discredit
upon
honourable
men
poets
and
men
of
letters
have
drawn
their
inspiration
from
their
strivings
and
in
return
have
decked
their
patriotism
with
imperishable
splendour
in
the
future
no
doubt
the
struggle
will
lie
between
this
party
and
the
hitherto
victorious
hierarchy
with
england
for
ally
and
the
fight
seems
a
wholly
unequal
one
it
was
into
an
advanced
and
vehement
group
of
patriots
that
mary
introduced
hyacinth
he
became
a
regular
reader
of
the
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
most
of
the
contributors
to
its
pages
he
found
them
clever
enthusiastic
and
agreeable
men
and
women
but
as
he
was
forced
to
admit
to
himself
occasionally
reckless
one
evening
a
discussion
took
place
in
mary
room
which
startled
and
shocked
him
excitement
ran
high
over
the
events
of
the
war
the
sympathies
of
the
irelanders
as
they
called
themselves
fiercely
assertive
even
in
their
name
were
of
course
entirely
with
the
boers
and
they
received
every
report
of
an
english
reverse
with
unmixed
satisfaction
when
hyacinth
entered
the
room
he
found
four
people
there
mary
herself
was
making
tea
at
a
little
table
near
the
fire
augusta
goold
the
famous
finola
was
stretched
in
a
deep
chair
smoking
a
cigarette
she
was
a
remarkable
woman
both
physically
and
intellectually
it
was
her
delight
to
emphasize
her
splendid
figure
by
draping
it
in
brilliant
reds
and
yellows
to
anyone
who
cared
to
speculate
on
such
a
subject
it
seemed
a
mystery
why
her
clothes
remained
on
her
when
she
walked
the
laws
of
gravity
seemed
to
demand
that
they
should
loosen
with
her
movements
become
detached
and
finally
drop
down
nothing
of
the
sort
had
ever
happened
so
it
must
be
presumed
that
she
had
secret
and
unconventional
ways
of
fastening
them
similarly
it
was
not
easy
to
see
why
her
hair
stayed
upon
her
head
it
was
arranged
upon
no
recognised
system
and
suggested
that
she
had
perfected
the
art
known
generally
only
to
heroines
of
romances
of
twisting
her
tresses
with
a
single
movement
into
a
loose
knot
that
she
affected
white
frills
of
immense
complexity
was
frequently
evident
owing
to
the
difficulty
she
experienced
in
confining
her
long
legs
to
feminine
attitudes
her
complexion
put
it
in
the
power
of
her
enemies
to
accuse
her
of
familiarity
with
cosmetics
a
slander
for
she
had
been
observed
to
turn
green
during
an
attack
of
she
had
great
brilliant
eyes
which
were
capable
of
expressing
intensity
of
enthusiasm
or
hatred
but
no
one
had
ever
seen
them
soften
with
any
emotion
like
love
her
attitude
towards
social
conventions
was
symbolized
by
her
clothes
in
the
old
days
when
the
houses
of
had
still
been
open
to
her
she
was
accustomed
to
challenge
criticism
by
fondling
a
pet
monkey
at
since
she
had
lost
caste
by
taking
up
the
cause
of
the
ape
had
been
discarded
and
the
same
result
achieved
by
occasional
bickerings
with
the
police
she
was
an
able
public
speaker
and
could
convince
her
audiences
for
a
time
of
the
reasonableness
of
opinions
which
next
morning
appeared
to
be
the
outcome
of
delirium
she
wrote
not
like
mary
verse
in
which
any
sentiment
may
be
excused
but
incisive
and
vigorous
prose
occasionally
even
the
castle
officials
got
glimmerings
of
the
meaning
of
one
of
her
articles
and
suppressed
the
whole
issue
of
the
in
which
it
appeared
near
her
sat
a
much
less
remarkable
person
thomas
grealy
historian
and
archaeologist
he
had
been
engaged
for
many
years
on
a
history
of
ireland
but
no
volume
of
it
had
as
yet
appeared
his
friends
suspected
that
he
had
got
permanently
stuck
somewhere
about
the
period
of
the
introduction
of
christianity
into
the
island
his
essays
published
in
the
dwelt
with
passionate
regret
on
the
departed
glories
of
tara
he
held
strong
views
about
the
historical
reality
of
the
and
got
irritated
at
the
most
casual
mention
of
theory
of
the
round
towers
he
had
proved
that
king
arthur
was
an
irishman
with
whose
reputation
malory
and
tennyson
had
taken
unwarrantable
liberties
the
name
of
dante
brought
a
smile
of
contempt
to
his
lips
for
he
knew
that
the
was
stolen
shamelessly
from
the
works
of
a
monk
of
cong
he
nourished
a
secret
passion
for
finola
he
never
ventured
to
declare
it
but
his
imagination
endowed
every
heroine
from
queen
maev
down
to
the
foster
daughter
of
the
leinster
farmer
who
married
king
cormac
with
miss
figure
eyes
and
hair
it
was
perhaps
the
burning
of
this
passion
which
rendered
him
so
cadaverous
that
his
clothes
in
other
respects
also
they
looked
as
if
they
had
been
bought
in
happier
days
hung
round
him
like
the
covering
of
a
umbrella
the
fourth
person
present
was
timothy
halloran
who
hovered
about
mary
he
was
what
the
country
people
call
a
destined
by
simple
and
pious
parents
to
take
holy
orders
he
got
as
far
as
the
inside
of
maynooth
college
while
there
he
had
kicked
a
down
the
whole
length
of
a
long
corridor
for
telling
tales
to
the
authorities
a
committee
of
ecclesiastics
considered
the
case
and
having
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
lacked
vocation
for
the
priesthood
sent
him
home
timothy
was
accustomed
to
say
that
his
violence
might
have
been
passed
over
but
that
his
failure
to
appreciate
the
devotion
to
duty
which
inspired
the
marked
him
decisively
as
unfit
for
ordination
he
never
regretted
his
expulsion
although
he
complained
bitterly
that
he
had
been
nearly
choked
before
they
cast
him
out
he
meant
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
the
effort
to
instil
a
proper
reverence
for
dogma
had
almost
destroyed
his
capacity
for
thought
not
that
the
fingers
of
the
reverend
professors
had
actually
closed
around
his
windpipe
his
subsequent
experiences
had
included
a
period
of
teaching
in
an
english
board
school
a
brief
but
not
wholly
unsatisfactory
career
as
a
political
organizer
in
new
york
and
a
return
to
ireland
where
he
earned
a
precarious
living
as
a
journalist
all
four
greeted
hyacinth
warmly
as
he
entered
the
room
were
just
discussing
said
mary
failure
of
our
attempt
to
organize
a
field
hospital
and
a
staff
of
nurses
for
the
boers
it
is
a
shame
to
have
to
admit
that
the
english
garrison
in
ireland
can
raise
thousands
of
pounds
for
their
war
funds
and
the
irish
be
got
to
subscribe
a
few
wealth
of
the
country
said
grealy
in
the
hands
of
a
minority
the
said
finola
sharply
you
ever
gave
a
thought
to
anything
more
recent
than
the
court
at
tara
you
would
know
that
the
landlords
are
not
the
wealthy
part
of
the
community
any
longer
many
a
provincial
publican
calling
himself
a
nationalist
who
could
buy
up
the
nearest
landlord
and
every
protestant
in
the
parish
along
with
him
a
protestant
myself
born
and
bred
among
the
class
you
speak
of
and
i
quite
right
miss
goold
said
tim
people
could
have
given
the
money
if
they
liked
i
attribute
the
failure
of
the
fund
to
the
apathy
or
treachery
of
the
priests
call
it
which
you
like
there
a
protestant
church
in
the
country
where
the
parsons
preach
give
to
their
people
sunday
after
sunday
and
the
result
why
they
have
raised
thousands
of
the
poem
you
published
in
last
said
hyacinth
to
mary
made
sure
the
subscriptions
would
have
come
in
your
appeal
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
things
i
ever
read
it
would
have
touched
the
heart
of
a
is
all
well
enough
said
tim
admire
your
verses
mary
as
much
as
anyone
but
we
want
a
collection
at
every
church
door
after
mass
what
we
ought
to
have
but
exactly
what
we
get
because
the
priests
are
west
britons
at
heart
they
would
pray
for
the
queen
and
the
army
like
cardinal
vaughan
if
they
believe
said
finola
we
went
the
wrong
way
about
the
thing
altogether
we
asked
for
a
hospital
and
we
appealed
to
the
pity
for
the
wounded
boers
nobody
in
ireland
cares
a
pin
about
the
boers
why
on
earth
should
we
from
all
i
can
hear
they
are
a
intolerant
set
of
hypocrites
just
as
soon
read
the
stuff
some
fool
of
an
english
newspaper
man
wrote
about
brother
the
as
listen
to
the
maudlin
sentiment
our
people
talk
we
want
to
help
the
boers
we
want
to
hurt
the
you
think
said
grealy
think
went
on
finola
we
ought
to
have
asked
for
volunteers
to
go
out
and
fight
instead
of
nurses
to
cocker
up
the
men
who
are
fools
enough
to
get
themselves
shot
have
got
would
not
said
tim
clergy
would
have
been
dead
against
you
they
would
have
nipped
the
whole
project
in
the
bud
without
so
much
as
making
a
noise
in
doing
true
said
grealy
miss
goold
it
was
the
priests
who
cursed
tara
and
the
monks
who
broke
the
power
of
the
irish
kings
i
worked
the
thing
out
yet
but
i
mean
to
show
finola
interrupted
the
poor
man
ruthlessly
try
it
anyway
preach
a
the
least
bit
of
good
said
tim
blackguard
in
the
country
is
enlisted
already
in
the
connaught
bangers
or
the
dublin
fusiliers
or
some
confounded
militia
regiment
nobody
left
but
the
nice
respectable
boys
who
leave
their
mothers
or
miss
going
to
confession
if
you
went
down
on
your
knees
to
then
the
irish
troops
ought
to
shoot
their
officers
and
walk
over
to
the
boer
camp
said
finola
savagely
hyacinth
half
smiled
at
what
seemed
to
him
a
monstrous
jest
then
when
he
perceived
that
she
was
actually
in
earnest
the
smile
froze
into
a
kind
of
grin
his
hands
trembled
with
the
violence
of
his
indignation
would
be
devilish
treachery
he
blurted
out
name
of
irishman
will
never
be
disgraced
by
such
an
augusta
goold
flung
her
cigarette
into
the
grate
and
rose
from
her
chair
she
stood
over
hyacinth
her
hands
clenched
and
her
bosom
heaving
rapidly
her
eyes
blazed
down
into
his
until
their
scorn
cowed
him
is
no
treachery
possible
for
an
irishman
she
said
the
one
of
fighting
for
england
any
deed
against
england
yes
deed
is
glorious
and
not
hyacinth
was
utterly
quelled
he
ventured
upon
no
reply
indeed
not
only
did
her
violence
render
argument
undesirable
and
it
seemed
for
the
moment
that
he
would
find
himself
in
actual
grips
with
a
furious
amazon
but
her
words
carried
with
them
a
certain
conviction
it
actually
seemed
to
him
while
she
spoke
as
if
a
good
defence
might
be
made
for
irish
soldiers
who
murdered
their
officers
and
deserted
to
an
enemy
in
the
field
it
was
not
until
hours
afterwards
when
the
vivid
impression
of
face
had
faded
from
his
recollection
when
he
had
begun
to
forget
the
flash
of
her
eyes
the
poise
of
her
figure
and
the
glow
of
her
draperies
that
his
moral
sense
was
able
to
reassert
itself
then
he
knew
that
she
had
spoken
wickedly
it
might
be
right
for
an
irishman
to
fight
against
england
when
he
could
it
might
be
justifiable
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
embarrassment
to
make
a
bid
for
freedom
by
striking
a
blow
at
the
empire
so
far
his
conscience
went
willingly
but
that
treachery
and
murder
could
ever
be
anything
but
horrible
he
refused
altogether
to
believe
another
conversation
in
which
he
took
part
about
this
time
helped
hyacinth
still
further
to
understand
the
position
of
his
new
friends
tim
halloran
and
he
were
smoking
and
chatting
together
over
the
fire
when
maguire
joined
them
the
matter
with
you
asked
halloran
look
as
if
been
at
your
not
so
far
out
in
your
guess
said
maguire
grimly
spent
the
morning
at
my
wedding
would
you
like
a
bit
of
the
cake
he
produced
from
his
pocket
a
paper
containing
crushed
fragments
of
white
sugar
and
a
shapeless
mass
of
citron
and
currants
the
compliments
of
the
reverend
mother
he
said
a
on
earth
do
you
mean
said
hyacinth
i
assure
you
the
sisters
of
pity
do
these
things
in
style
said
maguire
a
pretty
fancy
that
of
the
it
but
a
protestant
conneally
you
understand
this
delicate
playfulness
i
was
present
at
the
reception
of
my
only
sister
into
the
institute
of
the
catholic
sisters
of
pity
founded
by
honoria
kavanagh
lost
birdie
maguire
all
the
little
girl
that
used
to
climb
on
to
my
knee
and
kiss
me
and
instead
of
her
a
sister
monica
mary
who
will
no
doubt
pray
for
my
soul
when
was
the
figure
in
her
case
asked
tim
in
a
perfectly
tone
hundred
pounds
said
maguire
must
have
put
the
old
man
to
the
pin
of
his
collar
to
pay
it
the
only
time
he
ever
talked
to
me
about
his
affairs
he
told
me
he
had
got
four
hundred
pounds
put
by
for
fortune
and
that
i
was
to
have
my
medical
course
and
whatever
the
old
shop
would
fetch
when
he
was
gone
they
must
have
put
the
screw
on
pretty
tight
to
make
him
spring
the
extra
two
hundred
i
dare
say
i
shall
suffer
for
it
in
the
end
he
must
have
borrowed
the
hyacinth
felt
intensely
curious
about
this
young
nun
like
most
protestants
he
had
grown
up
to
regard
monasticism
in
all
its
forms
as
something
remote
partly
horrible
wholly
unintelligible
did
she
do
it
he
asked
sort
of
a
girl
was
she
do
you
mind
telling
me
in
the
least
said
maguire
not
sure
that
i
know
three
years
ago
that
is
when
i
left
home
she
was
the
last
sort
of
girl
you
could
imagine
going
into
a
convent
she
was
pretty
fond
of
nice
clothes
and
admiration
as
keen
as
every
girl
ought
to
be
on
a
dance
i
never
supposed
she
had
a
thought
of
religion
in
her
head
i
mean
beyond
the
usual
confessions
and
attendances
at
suppose
said
hyacinth
people
wanted
think
so
said
maguire
my
mother
did
i
see
conneally
said
tim
halloran
is
a
sort
of
of
respectability
among
people
like
to
have
a
girl
in
a
good
convent
a
little
lower
down
in
the
social
scale
in
the
class
i
come
from
the
boys
are
made
priests
a
doctor
is
a
more
expensive
article
to
manufacture
so
father
selected
that
line
of
life
for
him
not
that
they
could
have
made
a
priest
of
you
maguire
in
any
case
have
disgraced
maynooth
as
i
understand
said
hyacinth
thought
a
vocation
for
the
life
was
so
it
is
said
tim
halloran
you
see
the
period
of
the
novitiate
given
a
girl
at
an
impressionable
age
the
proper
convent
atmosphere
and
a
prize
of
six
hundred
pounds
for
the
order
and
it
will
go
hard
with
the
reverend
mother
if
she
work
the
girl
up
to
a
vocation
it
takes
a
man
a
lifetime
to
make
six
hundred
pounds
in
a
country
shop
but
many
a
one
who
does
it
by
hard
work
and
then
down
come
the
nuns
and
sweep
it
away
and
wasted
it
ought
to
be
invested
in
a
local
factory
or
in
waterworks
or
or
fifty
other
things
that
would
benefit
the
town
made
in
it
ought
to
be
fructifying
and
bearing
interest
instead
of
which
off
it
goes
to
munich
for
stained
glass
or
to
italy
for
a
marble
altar
is
it
any
wonder
ireland
is
crying
out
with
poverty
said
maguire
not
the
worst
of
it
be
content
to
let
them
take
the
damned
money
and
deck
their
churches
with
it
but
the
girls
there
are
hundreds
of
them
caught
every
year
for
nuns
and
swept
out
of
life
it
the
irish
convents
alone
that
get
them
american
nuns
come
over
and
australian
nuns
and
they
go
round
and
round
the
country
picking
up
girls
here
and
there
and
carry
them
off
there
i
want
to
talk
too
much
about
it
the
money
is
nothing
but
the
girls
and
boys
seems
strange
to
me
said
hyacinth
when
you
think
that
way
you
should
go
on
belonging
to
your
the
church
said
maguire
never
do
that
how
could
we
live
without
religion
and
what
other
religion
is
there
i
grant
you
that
your
priests
rob
us
but
but
think
of
the
cold
of
it
you
realize
it
conneally
but
think
what
it
would
mean
to
a
catholic
a
religion
without
saints
without
absolution
without
sacrifice
besides
what
we
complain
of
is
not
catholicism
a
parasitic
growth
destroying
the
true
faith
defiling
the
said
tim
halloran
even
from
my
point
of
view
how
should
we
be
the
better
of
a
change
your
church
is
ruled
by
old
women
who
think
the
name
of
englishman
the
most
glorious
in
the
world
you
preach
loyalty
and
i
believe
you
pray
for
the
queen
in
your
services
a
nice
fool
i
would
feel
praying
that
the
queen
should
have
victory
over
her
for
a
long
time
afterwards
this
conversation
dwelt
in
mind
tim
halloran
he
knew
to
be
practically
a
freethinker
but
maguire
regularly
heard
mass
on
sundays
and
often
went
to
confession
it
was
a
puzzle
how
he
could
do
so
feeling
as
he
did
about
the
religious
orders
so
insistent
did
the
problem
become
to
his
mind
that
he
found
himself
continually
leading
the
conversation
round
to
it
from
one
side
or
another
mary
told
him
that
she
also
had
a
sister
in
a
nunnery
teaches
girls
to
make
lace
and
wonderful
work
they
do
she
is
perfectly
happy
i
think
her
face
is
the
sweetest
and
most
beautiful
thing
i
have
ever
seen
there
is
not
a
line
on
it
of
care
or
of
fretfulness
it
seems
to
me
as
if
her
whole
life
might
be
described
as
a
quiet
smile
i
always
feel
better
by
the
mere
recollection
of
her
face
for
a
long
time
after
i
have
visited
her
oh
i
know
it
do
for
me
i
stand
it
for
a
week
i
should
go
mad
with
the
quiet
restraint
of
it
all
but
my
sister
is
happy
i
forget
that
i
suppose
she
has
a
said
hyacinth
thoughtfully
i
can
understand
how
that
would
make
all
the
difference
but
how
many
of
them
have
the
vocation
you
think
vocation
might
be
learnt
i
mean
one
grow
into
it
if
one
wished
to
very
much
and
if
the
life
was
constantly
before
eyes
beautiful
and
calm
it
was
almost
the
same
thought
which
timothy
halloran
had
suggested
mary
spoke
of
growing
into
vocation
tim
of
the
working
of
it
up
was
there
any
difference
except
a
verbal
one
on
another
occasion
he
spoke
to
henry
about
the
position
of
the
church
of
ireland
in
the
country
have
proved
said
the
professor
the
roman
claims
have
no
support
in
scripture
history
or
reason
our
books
remain
unanswered
because
they
are
unanswerable
we
can
do
no
might
offer
the
irish
people
a
church
which
they
could
join
said
hyacinth
do
we
offer
them
the
church
of
patrick
the
ancient
historic
church
of
ireland
we
offer
them
the
two
sacraments
of
the
gospel
administered
by
priests
duly
ordained
at
the
hands
of
an
episcopate
which
goes
back
in
an
unbroken
line
to
the
apostles
we
present
them
the
three
great
creeds
for
their
assent
we
use
a
liturgy
that
is
at
once
ancient
and
pure
the
church
of
ireland
has
all
this
is
beyond
dispute
a
branch
of
the
great
catholic
church
of
may
be
all
you
say
said
hyacinth
it
is
not
national
in
sentiment
and
sympathy
it
is
english
and
not
know
what
you
mean
said
henry
think
i
understand
how
you
feel
but
i
can
not
consent
to
the
conclusion
you
want
to
draw
there
is
no
real
meaning
in
the
cry
for
nationality
it
is
a
sentiment
a
fashion
and
will
pass
even
if
it
were
genuine
and
enduring
i
hold
it
to
be
better
for
ireland
to
be
an
integral
part
of
a
great
empire
than
a
contemptible
and
helpless
item
among
the
nations
of
the
world
a
prey
to
the
intrigues
of
ambitious
foreign
hyacinth
sighed
and
turned
to
go
but
henry
laid
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
detained
him
he
said
kindly
me
give
you
a
word
of
advice
mix
yourself
up
with
your
new
friends
too
much
you
will
ruin
your
own
prospects
in
life
if
you
do
there
is
nothing
more
fatal
to
a
man
among
the
people
with
whom
you
and
i
are
to
live
and
work
than
the
suspicion
of
being
tainted
with
nationalist
ideas
you
be
both
a
rebel
and
a
clergyman
you
see
he
added
with
a
smile
take
enough
interest
in
you
to
know
who
your
friends
are
and
what
you
are

to
help
the
boers
was
duly
set
forth
in
the
next
issue
of
the
it
included
two
appeals
one
for
money
and
one
for
men
the
details
were
worked
out
with
the
frank
contempt
for
possibility
which
characterizes
some
of
the
famous
suggestions
of
dean
swift
she
had
the
same
faculty
that
he
had
for
bringing
absurdities
within
the
range
of
the
commonplace
but
there
was
this
difference
between
them
miss
goold
quite
believed
in
her
own
plans
while
the
great
dean
no
doubt
grinned
over
the
of
his
it
happened
most
unfortunately
that
the
appeal
synchronized
with
another
also
for
funds
which
was
issued
by
the
leader
of
the
parliamentary
party
since
the
death
of
john
the
purse
of
the
party
had
been
getting
lean
the
old
tactics
which
used
to
draw
plaudits
and
dollars
from
the
united
states
as
well
as
a
tribute
from
every
parish
in
ireland
had
lately
been
unsuccessful
there
were
still
violent
scenes
in
the
house
of
commons
but
they
no
longer
produced
anything
except
contemptuous
smiles
members
of
parliament
still
succeeded
occasionally
in
getting
the
chief
secretary
to
imprison
them
but
the
glory
of
martyrdom
was
harder
to
win
than
in
the
old
days
latterly
things
had
come
to
such
a
pass
that
even
the
reduced
stipends
offered
to
the
members
fell
into
arrear
the
attendance
at
westminster
dropped
away
the
government
could
afford
to
smile
at
efforts
to
make
himself
disagreeable
and
the
opposition
were
frankly
contemptuous
of
a
people
who
could
not
profit
them
by
more
than
a
dozen
votes
in
a
critical
division
it
became
impossible
to
wring
even
a
modest
land
bill
from
the
prime
minister
and
chesney
now
much
at
ease
in
the
office
in
the
castle
scarcely
felt
it
necessary
to
be
civil
to
deputations
which
wanted
railways
it
was
clear
that
something
must
be
done
or
business
would
disappear
he
decided
to
appeal
for
funds
et
the
world
in
this
case
north
america
was
to
be
visited
exhorted
and
it
was
hoped
taxed
by
some
of
his
most
eloquent
lieutenants
even
canada
with
its
leaven
of
orangemen
was
to
be
honoured
with
the
speeches
of
an
orator
of
powers
the
city
dublin
of
course
was
the
chosen
scene
of
the
personal
exertions
since
his
revolt
against
john
had
been
a
little
shy
of
dublin
audiences
but
the
pressing
nature
of
the
present
crisis
almost
forced
him
to
pay
his
court
to
the
capital
he
found
some
comfort
in
the
recollection
that
during
the
five
years
that
had
elapsed
since
death
he
had
missed
no
public
opportunity
of
shedding
tears
beside
his
tomb
he
remembered
too
that
he
had
put
his
name
down
for
a
large
subscription
towards
the
erection
of
a
statue
to
the
dead
leader
a
work
of
art
which
the
existing
generation
seemed
unlikely
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
thus
it
happened
that
on
the
very
day
of
the
publication
of
miss
scheme
announced
his
intention
of
addressing
an
appeal
for
funds
to
a
public
meeting
in
the
rotunda
miss
goold
was
disconcerted
and
irritated
she
was
well
aware
that
appeal
would
give
the
respectable
nationalists
an
excellent
excuse
for
ignoring
hers
and
unfortunately
the
respectable
people
are
just
the
ones
who
have
most
money
she
was
confident
that
she
could
rely
on
the
extreme
section
of
the
nationalists
and
on
that
element
in
the
city
population
which
loves
and
makes
a
row
but
she
could
not
count
on
the
moneyed
classes
they
were
so
far
as
their
words
went
very
enthusiastic
for
the
boer
cause
but
when
it
came
to
writing
cheques
it
was
likely
that
the
of
the
parliamentary
fund
would
prove
too
strong
since
it
seemed
that
would
certainly
spoil
her
collection
the
obvious
thing
to
do
was
to
try
to
spoil
his
if
he
afforded
people
an
excuse
for
not
paying
the
travelling
expenses
of
her
volunteers
to
lorenzo
marques
she
would
if
possible
suggest
a
way
of
escape
from
paying
for
his
journeys
to
london
after
all
no
one
really
wanted
to
subscribe
to
either
fund
and
it
might
be
supposed
that
the
public
would
very
gladly
keep
their
purses
shut
altogether
for
an
irishman
it
is
quite
possible
to
be
genuinely
enthusiastic
and
at
the
same
time
able
to
see
the
humorous
side
of
his
own
enthusiasm
this
is
a
reason
why
an
irishman
is
never
a
bore
unless
to
gain
his
private
ends
he
wants
to
be
even
an
irish
advocate
of
total
abstinence
or
an
irish
antivaccinationist
if
such
a
thing
exists
is
not
a
bore
because
he
will
always
trot
out
his
conscientious
objections
with
a
smile
this
same
capacity
for
avoiding
the
slavery
of
serious
fanaticism
enables
an
irishman
to
cease
quite
joyfully
from
the
pursuit
of
his
own
particular
fad
in
order
to
corner
an
obnoxious
opponent
thus
augusta
goold
and
her
friends
were
genuinely
desirous
of
striking
a
blow
at
england
and
really
believed
that
their
volunteers
might
do
it
but
this
did
not
prevent
them
from
finding
infinite
relish
in
the
prospect
of
watching
squirming
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
they
took
counsel
together
and
the
result
of
their
deliberations
was
peculiar
they
proposed
to
invite
to
join
his
appeal
to
theirs
to
pool
the
money
which
came
in
and
to
divide
it
evenly
between
the
volunteers
and
the
members
of
parliament
it
was
tim
halloran
who
hit
upon
the
brilliant
idea
augusta
goold
chuckled
over
it
as
she
grasped
its
consequences
tim
argued
would
be
unwilling
to
accept
the
proposal
because
he
wanted
all
the
money
he
could
get
more
than
was
at
all
likely
to
be
collected
he
would
be
equally
unwilling
to
reject
it
because
he
could
then
be
represented
as
indifferent
to
the
heroic
struggle
of
the
boers
in
the
existing
state
of
irish
and
american
opinion
a
suspicion
of
such
indifference
would
be
quite
sufficient
to
wreck
his
chances
of
getting
any
money
at
all
of
course
the
obvious
way
of
making
such
a
proposal
would
have
been
by
letter
to
afterwards
the
correspondence
he
must
make
a
reply
of
some
sort
could
be
sent
to
the
press
and
sufficient
publicity
would
be
given
to
the
matter
this
was
what
tim
halloran
wanted
to
do
but
such
a
course
did
not
commend
itself
to
augusta
goold
it
lacked
dramatic
possibilities
and
there
was
always
the
chance
that
the
leading
papers
might
refuse
to
take
any
notice
of
the
matter
or
relegate
the
letters
to
a
back
page
and
small
print
besides
a
mere
newspaper
controversy
would
not
make
a
strong
appeal
to
the
section
of
the
dublin
populace
on
whose
support
she
chiefly
relied
a
much
more
attractive
plan
suggested
itself
augusta
goold
with
a
few
friends
to
act
as
would
present
herself
to
at
his
rotunda
meeting
and
put
the
proposal
to
him
then
and
there
in
the
presence
of
the
audience
in
the
meantime
the
few
days
before
the
meeting
were
occupied
in
scattering
suggestive
seed
over
the
hoardings
and
blank
walls
of
the
city
one
morning
people
were
startled
by
the
sight
of
an
immense
placard
which
asked
in
violent
red
letters
is
ireland
going
to
do
public
opinion
was
divided
about
the
ultimate
purpose
of
the
poster
the
majority
expected
the
announcement
of
a
new
play
or
novel
a
few
held
that
a
pill
or
a
cocoa
would
be
recommended
next
morning
the
question
became
more
explicit
and
the
hypothesis
of
the
play
and
the
pill
were
excluded
the
new
poster
ran
ireland
going
to
do
for
the
boers
the
public
were
not
intensely
anxious
to
find
an
answer
to
the
conundrum
thrust
thus
forcibly
on
their
attention
but
they
became
curious
to
know
who
the
advertisers
were
who
hungered
for
the
information
men
blessed
by
providence
with
faces
made
the
most
of
their
opportunity
and
informed
their
friends
that
the
thing
was
a
new
dodge
of
to
get
money
their
reputation
suffered
when
the
next
placard
appeared
the
advertisers
had
apparently
changed
their
minds
for
what
they
now
wanted
to
know
was
are
the
irish
going
to
do
for
the
boers
clearly
could
have
nothing
to
gain
by
insisting
on
an
answer
to
such
a
question
the
public
were
puzzled
but
pleased
the
of
the
city
foresaw
the
possibility
of
realizing
a
competence
for
the
next
morning
the
satisfied
inquirers
published
the
result
of
their
investigations
em
pees
it
was
thus
that
they
now
referred
to
the
honourable
members
of
parliament
supporting
the
infamies
of
it
was
at
this
point
that
the
eye
of
a
castle
official
was
caught
by
one
of
the
placards
as
he
made
his
way
to
the
kildare
street
club
for
luncheon
he
discussed
the
matter
with
a
colleague
and
it
occurred
to
them
that
since
they
were
paid
for
governing
ireland
they
ought
to
give
the
public
some
value
for
their
money
and
seize
the
opportunity
of
doing
something
they
sent
a
series
of
telegrams
to
london
house
which
were
forwarded
by
his
private
secretary
to
the
riviera
the
replies
which
followed
kept
the
castle
officials
in
a
state
of
pleasurable
excitement
until
quite
late
in
the
evening
at
about
eight
large
numbers
of
metropolitan
police
sallied
out
of
their
barracks
and
tore
down
the
last
batch
of
placards
next
morning
fresh
ones
were
posted
up
each
of
which
bore
the
single
word
the
were
highly
pleased
and
many
of
them
were
arrested
for
drunkenness
was
much
less
pleased
for
he
began
to
guess
what
the
answer
was
likely
to
be
and
how
it
would
affect
his
chances
of
securing
a
satisfactory
collection
the
officials
were
perplexed
they
suspected
the
of
containing
within
its
three
letters
some
hideous
sedition
but
it
was
not
possible
to
deal
vigorously
with
what
might
after
all
be
only
the
cunning
novelty
of
some
advertising
manufacturer
more
telegrams
harried
chesney
but
before
any
definite
course
of
action
had
been
decided
on
the
morning
of
the
rotunda
meeting
arrived
and
with
it
an
answer
to
the
multifarious
because
wants
all
the
money
to
spend
in
the
london
there
was
a
great
deal
of
laughter
and
many
people
quite
uninterested
in
politics
determined
to
go
to
the
meeting
in
hopes
of
more
amusement
when
took
the
chair
the
hall
was
crowded
to
its
utmost
capacity
under
ordinary
circumstances
this
would
have
augured
well
for
the
success
of
his
appeal
for
it
showed
that
the
public
were
at
all
events
not
apathetic
on
this
particular
occasion
however
would
have
been
better
pleased
with
a
smaller
audience
the
placards
had
shown
him
that
something
unpleasant
was
likely
to
occur
though
they
afforded
no
hint
of
the
form
which
the
unpleasantness
would
take
when
he
rose
to
his
feet
he
was
greeted
with
the
usual
volley
of
cheers
and
although
some
rude
remarks
about
the
boers
were
made
in
the
corners
of
the
hall
they
did
not
amount
to
anything
like
an
organized
attempt
at
interruption
he
began
his
speech
cautiously
feeling
the
pulse
of
his
audience
and
plying
them
with
the
platitudes
of
the
nationalist
platform
when
these
evoked
the
usual
enthusiasm
he
waxed
bolder
and
shot
out
some
almost
original
epigrams
directed
against
the
government
working
up
to
a
really
new
gibe
about
officials
who
sat
like
spiders
spinning
murderous
webs
in
dublin
castle
the
audience
were
delighted
with
this
but
their
joy
reached
its
height
when
someone
shouted
might
speak
better
of
the
men
who
tore
down
the
placard
on
ignored
the
suggestion
and
passed
on
to
sharpen
his
wit
upon
the
landlords
he
described
them
as
who
suck
the
of
the
country
and
refuse
to
disgorge
a
penny
of
it
for
any
useful
was
not
a
man
who
shrank
from
a
mixed
metaphor
or
paused
to
consider
such
trifles
as
the
unpleasantness
which
would
ensue
if
anyone
who
had
been
sucking
blood
were
to
repent
and
disgorge
it
he
went
on
to
ask
they
spend
their
immense
revenues
is
it
in
ireland
here
he
made
one
of
those
dramatic
pauses
for
which
his
oratory
was
famous
the
audience
waited
breathlessly
for
the
denunciation
which
was
to
follow
they
were
treated
unexpectedly
to
a
anticlimax
a
voice
spoke
softly
but
quite
clearly
from
the
back
of
the
hall
and
i
wonder
if
it
was
in
the
london
a
roar
of
laughter
followed
the
orator
might
no
doubt
have
made
an
effective
reply
but
every
time
he
opened
his
mouth
minor
wits
rending
like
wolves
the
carcase
of
the
original
joke
yelled
at
him
or
and
he
got
angry
and
consequently
flurried
he
tried
to
quell
the
tumult
by
thundering
out
the
denunciation
which
he
had
prepared
but
the
delight
which
the
audience
took
in
shrieking
the
items
of
their
imaginary
bill
of
fare
was
too
much
for
him
he
forgot
what
he
had
meant
to
say
floundered
attempted
to
pull
himself
together
and
brought
out
the
stale
jest
about
providing
each
landlord
with
a
single
ticket
to
holyhead
that
same
said
his
original
tormentor
be
cheaper
than
giving
you
a
return
ticket
to
the
audience
was
immensely
tickled
so
far
the
entertainment
if
not
precisely
novel
was
better
than
anything
they
had
hoped
for
and
everyone
had
an
agreeable
conviction
that
there
was
still
something
in
the
way
of
a
sensation
in
store
perhaps
it
was
eagerness
for
the
expected
climax
which
induced
them
to
keep
tolerably
quiet
during
the
remainder
of
speech
he
set
forth
at
some
length
the
glorious
achievements
of
his
party
in
the
past
and
explained
the
opportunities
of
future
usefulness
which
lay
to
be
grasped
if
only
the
necessary
funds
were
provided
he
sat
down
to
make
way
as
he
assured
the
audience
for
certain
tried
and
trusty
soldiers
of
the
cause
who
were
waiting
to
propose
important
resolutions
so
far
as
these
warriors
were
concerned
he
might
as
well
have
remained
standing
their
resolutions
are
to
this
day
unproposed
and
uncommended
a
secret
joy
no
doubt
to
those
who
framed
them
but
not
endorsed
by
any
popular
approval
hyacinth
conneally
was
not
admitted
to
the
secret
councils
of
augusta
goold
and
her
friends
he
knew
no
more
than
the
general
public
what
kind
of
a
coup
was
meditated
but
he
gathered
from
miss
nervous
excitement
and
tim
air
of
immense
and
mysterious
importance
that
something
quite
out
of
the
common
was
likely
to
occur
by
arriving
an
hour
and
a
half
before
the
opening
of
the
meeting
he
secured
a
seat
near
the
platform
he
enjoyed
the
discomfiture
of
whom
he
had
learnt
from
the
pages
of
the
to
despise
as
a
mere
windbag
and
to
hate
as
the
betrayer
of
a
sudden
thrill
of
excitement
went
through
him
when
sat
down
the
whole
audience
turned
their
faces
from
the
platform
towards
the
door
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
and
hyacinth
without
knowing
exactly
what
he
expected
turned
too
there
was
a
swaying
visible
among
the
crowd
near
the
door
and
almost
immediately
it
became
clear
that
someone
was
trying
to
force
a
way
through
the
people
curses
were
to
be
heard
and
even
cries
from
those
who
were
being
trodden
on
at
last
a
way
was
made
augusta
goold
followed
by
grealy
halloran
and
mary
came
slowly
up
the
hall
towards
the
platform
those
of
the
audience
whose
limbs
had
not
been
crushed
or
their
feet
mangled
in
preparation
for
her
progress
cheered
her
wildly
indeed
she
made
a
regal
appeal
to
them
even
amidst
a
crowd
of
men
her
height
made
her
conspicuous
and
she
had
arrayed
herself
for
the
occasion
in
a
magnificent
violet
robe
it
flowed
from
her
shoulders
in
spacious
folds
and
swept
behind
her
splendidly
contemptuous
of
the
part
it
played
as
scavenger
amid
the
accumulated
filth
of
the
floor
her
bare
arms
shone
out
of
the
wide
sleeves
which
hung
around
them
her
neck
rose
strong
and
stately
over
the
silver
clasp
of
a
cloak
which
she
had
thrown
back
from
her
shoulders
she
wore
a
hat
which
seemed
to
hold
her
hair
captive
from
falling
loose
around
her
one
great
tress
alone
escaped
from
it
and
by
some
cunning
manipulation
was
made
to
stand
straight
out
as
if
blown
by
the
wind
from
its
fastenings
in
comparison
her
suite
looked
commonplace
and
mean
poor
miss
was
arrayed
she
would
have
said
herself
in
reporting
the
scene
in
vesture
not
wanting
in
splendour
but
which
beside
miss
could
not
catch
the
eye
thomas
grealy
awkward
and
stooped
peered
through
his
glasses
at
the
crowd
tim
halloran
walked
jauntily
but
his
eyes
glanced
nervously
from
side
to
side
he
was
certainly
ill
at
ease
possibly
frightened
at
the
position
in
which
he
found
himself
a
hurried
consultation
took
place
among
the
gentlemen
on
the
platform
which
ended
in
stepping
forward
with
a
smile
and
an
outstretched
hand
to
welcome
augusta
goold
as
she
ascended
the
steps
the
expression
of
his
face
belied
the
smile
which
he
had
impressed
upon
his
lips
his
eyes
had
the
same
look
of
furtive
malice
as
a
which
wants
to
bite
but
fears
the
stick
augusta
goold
waved
aside
the
proffered
hand
and
stepped
unaided
on
to
the
platform
placed
a
chair
for
her
but
she
ignored
it
and
stood
with
her
followers
behind
her
facing
the
audience
and
two
of
his
tried
and
trusty
members
of
parliament
approached
her
they
stood
between
her
and
the
audience
and
talked
to
her
for
some
time
apparently
very
earnestly
augusta
goold
looked
past
them
over
them
sometimes
it
seemed
through
them
while
they
spoke
but
made
them
no
answer
whatever
at
last
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
withdrew
to
his
chair
with
a
sulky
scowl
wish
said
augusta
goold
ask
a
simple
question
of
your
rose
meeting
he
said
convened
for
the
purpose
of
raising
funds
for
the
carrying
on
of
the
national
business
in
the
house
of
commons
if
miss
question
relates
to
the
business
in
hand
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
answer
it
if
not
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
allow
it
to
be
asked
here
at
another
time
and
in
another
place
i
shall
be
prepared
to
listen
to
what
miss
goold
has
to
say
and
in
the
meantime
if
she
will
take
her
seat
on
the
platform
she
will
be
heartily
question
said
augusta
goold
intimately
connected
with
the
business
of
the
meeting
it
is
simply
this
are
you
prepared
to
give
any
portion
of
the
money
entrusted
to
you
by
the
irish
people
to
assist
the
boers
in
their
struggle
for
freedom
it
was
manifestly
absurd
to
ask
such
a
question
at
all
had
no
intention
of
collecting
money
for
the
boers
who
seemed
to
have
plenty
of
their
own
and
he
could
not
without
breach
of
trust
have
applied
funds
subscribed
to
feed
and
clothe
members
of
parliament
to
arming
volunteers
nevertheless
it
was
an
awkward
question
to
answer
in
the
presence
of
an
audience
excited
by
augusta
beauty
and
splendid
audacity
a
really
strong
man
like
for
instance
predecessor
john
might
have
faced
the
situation
and
won
if
not
the
immediate
cheers
at
least
the
respect
of
the
irish
people
but
was
not
a
strong
man
and
besides
he
was
out
of
temper
and
had
lost
his
nerve
he
took
perhaps
the
worst
course
open
to
him
he
made
a
speech
he
appealed
to
his
past
record
as
a
nationalist
and
to
his
publicly
reiterated
expressions
of
sympathy
with
the
boer
cause
he
asked
the
audience
to
trust
him
to
do
what
was
right
but
he
neither
said
yes
nor
no
to
the
question
he
was
asked
augusta
goold
stood
calm
and
impassive
while
he
spoke
a
sneer
gathered
on
her
lips
and
indrawn
nostrils
as
he
made
his
appeal
for
the
confidence
when
he
had
finished
she
said
very
slowly
and
with
that
extreme
distinctness
of
articulation
which
women
speakers
seem
to
learn
so
much
more
easily
than
men
you
prepared
to
give
any
portion
of
the
money
entrusted
to
you
by
the
irish
people
to
assist
the
boers
in
their
struggle
for
freedom
was
goaded
into
attempting
another
speech
but
the
audience
was
in
no
mood
to
listen
to
him
he
was
interrupted
again
and
again
with
shouts
of
or
no
the
question
the
bantering
tone
with
which
they
had
plied
him
earlier
in
the
evening
with
suggestions
for
a
menu
had
changed
now
into
angry
insistence
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
with
a
gesture
of
despair
and
sat
down
at
once
the
tumult
ceased
and
the
people
waited
breathless
for
augusta
goold
to
speak
again
you
she
seemed
to
have
learnt
her
question
off
by
heart
give
any
portion
of
the
money
entrusted
to
you
by
the
irish
people
to
assist
the
boers
in
their
struggle
for
freedom
shea
a
member
of
parliament
from
co
limerick
being
himself
one
of
those
most
deeply
interested
in
the
contents
of
the
purse
sprang
to
his
feet
it
was
clear
that
he
was
in
a
condition
of
almost
dangerous
excitement
for
he
stammered
as
he
shouted
to
the
chairman
is
this
this
this
woman
to
be
allowed
to
interrupt
the
meeting
i
demand
her
immediate
augusta
goold
smiled
at
him
it
was
really
a
very
gracious
almost
a
tender
smile
one
might
imagine
the
divine
theodora
in
her
earlier
days
smiling
with
just
such
an
expression
on
a
plebeian
lover
whose
passion
she
regarded
as
creditable
to
him
but
hopeless
assure
you
shea
that
i
shall
not
interrupt
the
business
for
more
than
a
minute
has
only
got
to
say
one
word
either
yes
or
no
are
you
prepared
to
give
any
portion
of
the
funds
entrusted
to
you
by
the
irish
people
to
assist
the
boers
in
their
struggle
for
freedom
shea
was
not
at
all
mollified
either
by
the
smile
or
the
politeness
of
her
tone
shall
not
permit
the
meeting
to
be
interrupted
any
more
he
shouted
you
will
withdraw
at
once
or
we
shall
have
you
removed
by
she
smiled
at
him
again
a
pitying
smile
as
if
she
regretted
the
petulance
of
his
manner
and
turned
to
the
chairman
you
prepared
to
give
then
feelings
became
too
strong
for
his
he
sprang
forward
apparently
with
the
intention
of
laying
violent
hands
upon
augusta
groold
hyacinth
conneally
started
up
to
protect
her
and
the
same
impulse
moved
a
large
part
of
the
audience
there
was
a
rush
for
the
platform
and
a
fierce
threatening
yell
shea
hung
back
frightened
augusta
goold
held
up
her
hand
and
immediately
the
rush
stopped
and
the
people
were
silent
she
went
on
with
her
question
taking
it
up
at
the
exact
word
which
shea
had
interrupted
in
the
same
level
and
exquisitely
irritating
tone
any
of
the
money
entrusted
to
you
by
the
irish
people
to
assist
the
boers
in
their
struggle
for
freedom
had
sat
scowling
silently
since
the
failure
of
his
last
attempt
to
explain
himself
this
final
disjointed
repetition
of
the
galling
question
roused
him
to
the
necessity
of
doing
something
he
was
a
pitiful
sight
as
he
rose
and
confronted
augusta
goold
there
were
blotches
of
purple
red
and
spaces
of
pallor
on
his
face
his
hands
twisted
together
a
sweat
had
broken
out
from
his
neck
and
made
his
collar
limp
his
words
were
a
stammering
mixture
of
bluster
and
appeal
interrupt
the
meeting
so
far
he
tried
to
assert
himself
then
with
a
glance
at
the
contemptuous
face
of
the
woman
before
him
he
relapsed
into
the
tone
of
a
schoolboy
who
begs
off
the
last
strokes
of
a
caning
this
nice
conduct
is
it
ladylike
to
come
here
and
attack
us
like
this
miss
goold
ashamed
of
am
glad
to
hear
said
augusta
goold
departing
for
the
first
time
from
her
question
there
is
anything
left
in
the
world
that
is
ashamed
of
i
think
there
it
was
shea
and
not
his
leader
who
resented
this
last
insult
his
lips
drew
apart
leaving
his
teeth
bare
in
a
ghastly
grin
he
clenched
his
fists
and
stood
for
a
moment
trembling
from
head
to
foot
then
he
leaped
forward
towards
augusta
goold
the
man
who
stood
next
hyacinth
lurched
suddenly
forward
wrenched
his
right
hand
free
of
the
crowd
round
him
and
flung
it
back
behind
his
head
hyacinth
saw
that
he
held
a
large
stone
in
it
are
a
cowardly
blackguard
shea
he
yelled
damned
cowardly
blackguard
would
you
strike
a
woman
shea
turned
on
the
instant
saw
the
hand
stretched
back
to
fling
the
stone
he
seized
the
chair
behind
him
the
very
chair
which
while
an
appearance
of
politeness
was
still
possible
had
offered
to
augusta
goold
and
flung
it
with
all
his
force
at
the
man
with
the
stone
one
of
the
legs
grazed
cheek
scraping
the
skin
off
the
corner
of
the
seat
struck
the
man
beside
him
full
across
the
forehead
just
above
his
eyes
the
blood
poured
out
blinding
and
then
as
he
gasped
choking
him
he
reeled
and
huddled
together
helplessly
he
could
not
fall
for
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
round
him
held
him
up
hyacinth
felt
his
hands
groping
wildly
as
if
for
support
and
reached
out
his
own
to
grasp
him
but
the
man
wanted
no
help
for
himself
as
soon
as
he
felt
another
hand
touch
his
he
pressed
the
stone
into
it
see
he
whispered
hoarsely
it
you
and
kill
him
kill
him
kill
him
smash
his
skull
hyacinth
took
the
stone
the
feel
of
the
blood
warm
on
it
and
the
fierce
yelling
and
stamping
of
the
crowd
filled
him
with
a
mad
lust
of
hate
against
shea
who
stood
as
if
suddenly
paralyzed
within
a
few
feet
of
him
he
wrenched
his
hand
free
and
with
a
mighty
effort
flung
the
stone
he
saw
it
strike
shea
fair
on
the
forehead
in
spite
of
the
tumult
around
him
he
fancied
he
heard
the
dull
thud
of
its
impact
he
saw
shea
fling
up
his
hands
and
pitch
forward
he
saw
augusta
goold
gather
her
skirts
in
her
hand
and
sweep
them
swiftly
aside
lest
the
man
should
fall
on
them
then
the
crowd
pressing
towards
the
platform
swept
him
off
his
feet
and
he
was
tossed
helplessly
forward
a
giddy
sickness
seized
him
the
pressure
slackened
for
an
instant
and
he
fell
boot
struck
him
on
the
head
he
felt
without
any
keen
regret
that
he
was
likely
to
be
trampled
to
death
then
he
lost
consciousness
chapter
vi
next
morning
the
dublin
daily
papers
laid
themselves
out
to
make
the
most
of
the
sensational
fight
at
the
rotunda
even
the
habitually
cautious
felt
that
the
occasion
justified
the
expression
of
an
opinion
and
that
there
would
be
no
serious
risk
of
alienating
the
sympathies
of
subscribers
and
advertisers
by
condemning
the
bloodshed
it
published
an
exceedingly
dignified
and
stodgy
leading
article
drawing
the
largest
and
finest
words
from
the
dictionary
and
weaving
them
with
extraordinary
art
into
sentences
which
would
have
been
creditable
to
anyone
bent
upon
imitating
the
style
of
samuel
johnson
the
british
empire
and
the
whole
of
civilized
europe
were
called
upon
to
witness
the
unspeakably
deplorable
consequences
which
invariably
followed
the
habitual
neglect
of
the
cultivation
of
the
elementary
decencies
of
public
life
the
paper
disclaimed
any
sympathy
with
either
of
the
belligerent
parties
and
pointed
out
with
sorrowful
solemnity
that
if
the
principles
sedulously
inculcated
upon
its
readers
in
its
own
columns
were
persistently
flouted
and
contemned
by
those
who
claimed
the
position
of
national
representatives
little
else
except
a
repetition
at
frequent
intervals
of
the
painful
and
humiliating
scenes
of
the
night
before
could
possibly
be
anticipated
by
reasonable
observers
of
the
general
trend
of
democratic
institutions
the
openly
exulted
over
the
rioters
its
leading
article
the
staff
may
have
danced
in
a
ring
round
the
office
table
while
composing
it
declared
that
now
at
length
the
irish
had
proved
to
the
world
that
they
were
all
without
a
solitary
exception
irredeemably
vicious
miss
augusta
goold
was
warmly
praised
for
having
demonstrated
once
for
all
that
ought
to
be
written
deep
regret
was
expressed
that
those
who
attended
the
meeting
had
not
been
armed
with
revolvers
instead
of
stones
and
that
the
platform
had
not
been
defended
with
maxim
guns
instead
of
comparatively
innocuous
wooden
chairs
had
modern
weapons
of
precision
been
used
the
would
have
been
able
to
congratulate
mankind
on
getting
rid
of
quite
a
considerable
number
of
irishmen
the
and
the
were
awkwardly
situated
their
sympathies
were
entirely
with
and
they
were
exceedingly
angry
with
miss
goold
for
interfering
with
the
collection
of
funds
for
the
parliamentary
party
at
the
same
time
they
felt
a
difficulty
in
denouncing
her
not
for
want
of
suitable
language
the
irish
nationalist
press
has
a
superb
command
of
words
which
a
dictionary
would
hesitate
to
recognise
but
because
they
felt
that
push
of
the
horns
of
the
dilemma
on
which
had
been
impaled
and
they
were
obliged
to
sand
their
denunciations
between
layers
of
stoutest
sentiment
all
four
papers
contained
reports
of
the
proceedings
which
were
practically
identical
up
to
a
certain
point
it
was
about
the
commencement
of
the
actual
bloodshed
that
they
differed
the
reporter
believed
that
shea
had
begun
the
fray
by
striking
augusta
goold
behind
the
ear
with
his
clenched
fist
the
man
claimed
to
have
overheard
urging
his
friends
to
brain
a
member
of
the
audience
with
a
chair
the
held
that
augusta
supporters
had
come
into
the
hall
supplied
with
huge
stones
which
at
a
given
signal
they
had
flung
at
the
inoffensive
members
of
parliament
who
occupied
the
platform
adding
as
a
corroborative
detail
that
the
lady
who
accompanied
augusta
goold
had
twice
kicked
the
prostrate
shea
in
the
stomach
the
advanced
the
ingenious
theory
that
the
contest
had
been
precipitated
by
a
malevolent
student
of
trinity
college
who
had
flung
an
apple
of
discord
on
this
occasion
a
jagged
of
unusual
size
into
the
midst
of
a
group
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
were
peacefully
discussing
a
slight
difference
of
opinion
among
themselves
beyond
this
point
none
of
the
papers
gave
any
account
of
the
proceedings
all
four
reporters
having
recognised
that
not
being
retained
as
war
correspondents
they
were
not
called
upon
to
risk
their
lives
on
the
battlefield
the
accounts
all
closed
with
the
information
that
the
wounded
had
been
carried
to
jervis
street
hospital
and
were
under
treatment
suitable
to
their
injuries
hyacinth
had
suffered
a
slight
concussion
of
the
brain
and
a
flesh
wound
other
sufferers
were
in
the
same
ward
shea
himself
occupying
a
bed
so
that
hyacinth
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
stretched
out
a
melancholy
figure
with
a
bandage
concealing
most
of
his
red
hair
after
the
surgeon
had
finished
his
rounds
for
the
morning
a
police
official
visited
the
sufferers
and
made
a
careful
note
of
their
names
and
addresses
he
inquired
in
a
perfunctory
manner
whether
any
of
them
wished
to
swear
an
information
no
one
except
shea
was
sufficiently
satisfied
with
his
own
share
of
the
meeting
to
wish
for
more
fame
than
was
unavoidable
as
no
further
use
was
ever
made
of
narrative
it
may
be
presumed
that
the
authorities
regarded
it
as
wanting
in
accuracy
no
blame
however
ought
to
be
attached
to
the
author
for
any
petty
deviation
from
the
truth
of
which
he
may
have
been
guilty
no
mind
is
perfectly
clear
on
the
morning
after
he
has
been
struck
on
the
head
with
a
stone
and
perhaps
afterwards
kicked
twice
in
the
stomach
by
a
lady
journalist
besides
all
members
of
parliament
are
in
virtue
of
their
office
an
excited
and
sympathetic
nurse
provided
hyacinth
with
copies
of
the
four
morning
papers
which
he
read
with
interest
and
a
good
deal
of
amusement
only
the
account
in
the
caused
him
any
uneasiness
no
doubt
as
he
fully
recognised
the
suggestion
about
the
trinity
student
was
nothing
but
a
wild
guess
on
the
part
of
the
reporter
it
was
highly
unlikely
that
anyone
would
seriously
consider
a
theory
so
intrinsically
improbable
still
if
the
faintest
suspicion
of
the
part
he
had
played
reached
the
ears
of
the
college
authorities
he
felt
that
his
career
as
a
divinity
student
was
likely
to
be
an
extremely
brief
one
his
chief
fear
was
that
a
prolonged
absence
from
college
would
give
rise
to
inquiry
and
that
his
bandages
would
excite
suspicion
when
he
reappeared
fortunately
the
house
surgeon
decided
that
he
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
be
allowed
to
leave
the
hospital
early
in
the
afternoon
the
boot
which
had
put
an
end
to
his
share
in
the
riot
had
raised
its
bruise
under
his
hair
so
he
was
able
to
remove
the
bandages
from
his
head
as
soon
as
he
got
into
the
street
there
still
remained
a
long
strip
of
plaster
meant
to
keep
a
dressing
of
iodoform
in
its
place
over
the
cut
on
his
cheek
which
had
inflicted
this
he
could
not
get
off
and
thinking
it
wiser
to
make
his
entry
into
college
after
nightfall
he
sought
a
refuge
in
mary
rooms
he
found
the
poetess
laid
on
a
sofa
and
clad
in
a
blue
she
stretched
a
hand
of
welcome
to
hyacinth
and
then
before
he
had
time
to
take
it
began
to
laugh
immoderately
the
laughing
fit
ended
in
sobs
and
then
tears
flowed
from
her
eyes
which
she
mopped
convulsively
with
an
already
damp
before
she
had
recovered
sufficient
to
speak
she
signed
to
hyacinth
to
fetch
a
bottle
of
from
the
he
hastened
to
obey
and
found
himself
kneeling
beside
the
sofa
holding
the
bottle
to
her
nose
after
a
while
she
recovered
sufficiently
to
tell
him
that
she
had
not
slept
at
all
during
the
night
and
felt
extremely
unwell
and
quite
unstrung
in
consequence
another
fit
of
immoderate
and
tearful
laughter
followed
and
hyacinth
embarrassed
and
alarmed
fetched
a
tumbler
of
from
the
syphon
on
the
sideboard
the
lady
refused
to
swallow
any
and
just
as
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
risk
an
external
application
recovered
again
during
the
lucid
interval
which
followed
she
informed
him
that
his
own
conduct
had
been
superb
and
heroic
what
seemed
to
be
an
effort
to
celebrate
his
achievements
in
extemporary
verse
brought
on
another
fit
hyacinth
determined
to
risk
an
appearance
in
the
college
square
in
broad
daylight
rather
than
continue
his
ministrations
while
he
was
searching
for
his
hat
miss
became
suddenly
quite
calm
and
began
to
explain
to
him
how
immensely
the
cause
of
independence
had
benefited
by
the
demonstration
in
the
rotunda
hyacinth
listened
anxiously
waiting
for
the
next
explosion
and
experienced
very
great
relief
when
the
door
opened
and
augusta
goold
walked
in
unlike
mary
she
was
entirely
mistress
of
herself
her
cheeks
were
not
a
shade
paler
than
usual
nor
her
hand
at
all
less
cool
and
firm
she
stretched
herself
after
her
usual
fashion
in
the
largest
available
chair
and
lit
a
cigarette
look
excited
my
dear
mary
she
said
little
overexcited
perhaps
have
you
had
tea
no
perhaps
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
ring
the
bell
mary
repeated
the
information
she
had
given
hyacinth
about
her
sleepless
night
and
complimented
augusta
goold
on
her
nerve
for
poor
little
me
she
went
on
like
a
like
a
you
remember
the
kind
of
thing
you
like
a
not
sure
if
i
know
the
name
of
the
thing
she
relapsed
into
a
weak
giggle
and
hyacinth
stooped
for
the
bottle
of
which
had
rolled
under
the
sofa
augusta
goold
was
much
less
sympathetic
she
fixed
her
with
a
strong
stare
of
amazement
and
disgust
apparently
this
treatment
was
the
right
one
for
the
giggling
stopped
almost
immediately
see
you
have
got
some
on
your
face
conneally
she
said
when
mary
had
quieted
down
said
hyacinth
a
bump
behind
my
suppose
this
business
will
be
very
awkward
for
you
in
college
will
they
turn
you
out
sure
they
will
if
they
find
out
that
i
threw
that
stone
at
made
a
very
good
shot
said
augusta
smiling
at
the
recollection
how
on
earth
did
you
come
to
have
a
stone
that
size
in
the
hall
with
you
hyacinth
told
the
story
of
the
man
who
had
been
felled
by
the
chair
and
his
murderous
bequest
the
proper
spirit
said
augusta
admire
that
man
and
he
have
passed
his
stone
on
to
better
hands
than
yours
shea
went
down
as
if
he
had
been
shot
i
was
afraid
of
my
life
he
would
clutch
at
my
skirts
as
he
fell
or
squirm
up
against
me
after
he
was
down
but
he
lay
quite
still
by
the
way
mary
i
suppose
your
dress
was
ruined
mary
was
quite
subdued
was
torn
she
said
meekly
enough
you
another
one
course
i
have
three
others
besides
some
old
then
better
go
and
put
on
one
of
them
an
old
one
will
do
disgusting
to
see
a
woman
slopping
about
in
a
at
this
time
of
day
have
tea
ready
when
you
come
miss
obeyed
sulkily
she
wished
very
much
that
augusta
goold
had
stopped
at
home
it
would
have
been
a
great
deal
pleasanter
to
have
gone
on
practising
hysterics
with
hyacinth
as
a
sympathetic
spectator
when
the
door
was
shut
augusta
goold
turned
to
hyacinth
again
the
worst
of
apparently
she
did
not
consider
herself
as
one
of
the
sex
are
all
right
at
the
time
nothing
could
have
been
better
than
behaviour
at
the
meeting
but
they
collapse
afterwards
in
such
idiotic
ways
but
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
yourself
i
owe
you
a
good
turn
for
what
you
did
last
night
only
for
you
i
think
shea
would
have
dared
to
touch
me
and
then
very
likely
i
should
have
killed
him
and
there
might
have
been
trouble
she
spoke
quite
calmly
but
hyacinth
had
very
little
doubt
that
she
meant
exactly
what
she
said
of
course
was
useless
one
might
have
expected
him
to
give
utterance
to
an
ancient
tribal
but
he
even
do
that
tim
halloran
got
frightened
when
the
row
began
i
noticed
him
dodging
about
behind
mary
and
me
and
i
mean
to
let
him
know
what
i
think
about
him
you
i
have
to
thank
and
i
forget
it
if
you
get
into
trouble
over
this
business
in
college
come
to
me
and
i
will
see
you
straight
in
fact
if
you
like
to
give
up
the
divinity
student
business
at
once
i
dare
say
i
can
put
you
in
the
way
of
earning
an
honester
hyacinth
was
gratified
at
the
way
augusta
goold
spoke
to
him
since
the
evening
on
which
he
had
given
his
opinion
about
the
morality
of
desertion
and
murder
he
had
been
conscious
of
a
coolness
in
her
manner
now
he
had
apparently
reinstated
himself
in
her
good
graces
praise
even
for
an
act
he
was
secretly
ashamed
of
and
gratitude
though
he
by
no
means
recognised
that
he
deserved
it
were
pleasant
to
him
he
promised
to
remember
the
offer
of
help
but
declined
for
the
present
to
commit
his
future
to
the
keeping
of
so
bloodthirsty
a
patroness
curiously
enough
reception
in
college
was
a
great
deal
more
cordial
after
the
rotunda
meeting
than
it
had
ever
been
before
for
a
while
the
battle
which
had
been
fought
at
their
doors
superseded
the
remoter
south
african
warfare
as
a
topic
of
conversation
among
the
students
their
sympathies
were
with
augusta
goold
even
members
of
the
divinity
classes
suffered
themselves
to
be
lured
from
their
habitual
worship
of
respectability
so
far
as
to
express
admiration
for
the
dramatic
picturesqueness
of
the
part
she
played
it
is
true
that
the
lady
herself
was
called
by
names
universally
resented
by
women
and
that
the
broadest
slanders
were
circulated
about
her
character
still
a
halo
of
glory
hung
round
her
it
was
felt
that
she
had
done
a
surprisingly
courageous
thing
when
she
faced
on
his
own
platform
also
she
had
behaved
with
a
certain
dignity
neither
throwing
chairs
nor
stones
at
her
opponents
then
she
was
an
undeniably
beautiful
woman
a
fact
which
made
its
inevitable
appeal
to
the
young
men
the
mere
expression
of
sympathy
with
this
flamboyant
and
heroine
brought
with
it
a
delightful
flavour
of
gay
and
worldly
vice
it
was
pretty
well
known
that
hyacinth
was
a
friend
of
miss
and
it
was
rumoured
that
he
had
earned
his
piece
of
in
her
defence
no
one
knew
exactly
what
he
had
done
or
how
much
he
had
suffered
but
a
great
many
men
were
anxious
to
know
very
much
to
his
own
surprise
he
received
a
number
of
visitors
in
his
rooms
men
who
had
been
the
foremost
of
his
tormentors
came
ostensibly
to
inquire
for
his
health
in
reality
to
glean
details
of
the
fight
at
the
rotunda
certain
medical
students
of
the
kind
which
glory
in
any
kind
of
row
openly
congratulated
him
on
his
luck
in
being
present
on
such
an
occasion
men
who
claimed
to
be
fast
and
tried
to
impress
their
acquaintances
with
the
belief
that
they
indulged
habitually
in
wild
scenes
of
revelry
courted
hyacinth
and
boasted
afterwards
of
their
acquaintance
with
miss
goold
it
became
the
fashion
to
be
seen
with
him
in
the
quadrangle
and
to
inquire
from
him
in
public
for
this
new
popularity
by
no
means
pleased
hyacinth
he
was
not
at
all
proud
of
his
share
in
the
rotunda
meeting
and
lived
in
daily
dread
of
being
recognised
as
the
assailant
of
shea
he
knew
too
that
he
was
making
no
way
with
the
better
class
of
students
the
men
whose
faces
he
liked
were
more
than
ever
shy
of
making
his
acquaintance
the
and
minor
professors
in
the
divinity
school
were
coldly
contemptuous
in
their
manner
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
even
henry
was
less
friendly
he
became
desperately
anxious
to
get
out
of
a
position
which
he
found
more
intolerable
than
the
original
isolation
he
applied
himself
with
extreme
diligence
to
his
studies
even
affecting
an
interest
unnatural
for
the
most
pious
in
the
expositions
given
by
learned
doctors
of
the
articles
at
lectures
on
church
history
he
made
notes
about
the
vagaries
of
heretics
so
assiduously
that
the
professor
began
to
hope
that
there
existed
one
student
at
least
who
took
an
interest
in
the
christological
controversies
of
the
sixth
century
he
never
ventured
back
again
to
the
wednesday
but
he
performed
many
attendances
beyond
the
required
minimum
at
the
college
chapel
morning
after
morning
he
dragged
himself
from
his
bed
and
hurried
across
the
dusky
quadrangle
to
take
his
part
in
the
mutilated
matins
with
which
the
college
authorities
see
fit
to
usher
in
the
day
he
even
went
to
hear
the
sermons
delivered
on
friday
afternoons
homilies
so
painful
that
the
preachers
themselves
recognise
an
extraordinary
merit
in
enduring
them
and
allow
that
submission
of
the
ears
to
one
of
them
is
to
be
reckoned
as
equal
to
two
ordinary
acts
of
devotion
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
hyacinth
derived
some
remote
benefit
from
the
discipline
to
which
he
subjected
himself
for
the
immediate
results
were
not
satisfactory
he
seemed
no
nearer
winning
the
respect
of
the
more
serious
students
and
manner
showed
no
signs
of
softening
into
friendliness
his
surfeit
of
theology
bred
in
him
a
dislike
of
the
subject
the
solemn
platitudes
which
were
posed
as
expositions
of
the
creeds
affected
his
mind
much
as
the
expurgated
life
histories
of
maiden
aunts
do
the
the
relentless
closing
in
of
argument
upon
a
single
previously
settled
doctrine
woke
in
him
a
desire
to
break
through
at
some
point
and
breathe
again
in
the
open
he
began
to
fear
that
he
was
becoming
hopelessly
irreligious
his
morning
devotions
in
the
foggy
atmosphere
of
the
chapel
did
not
touch
the
capacity
for
enthusiasm
within
him
the
vague
splendour
of
his
meditations
had
left
him
outside
indeed
but
sure
that
within
there
lay
a
great
reality
but
now
religion
had
come
to
seem
an
altogether
narrower
thing
a
fenced
off
garden
in
which
useful
vegetables
might
be
cultivated
but
very
little
inspiring
to
the
soul
the
unwelcome
attention
of
the
students
whose
friendship
he
did
not
desire
and
his
increasing
dislike
for
the
work
he
was
expected
to
do
led
him
to
spend
more
and
more
of
his
time
with
augusta
goold
and
her
friends
he
found
in
their
society
that
note
of
enthusiasm
which
he
missed
in
the
religion
of
the
college
he
responded
warmly
to
their
passionate
devotion
to
the
dream
of
an
independent
irish
republic
he
felt
less
conscious
of
his
want
of
religion
in
their
company
with
the
exception
of
augusta
goold
herself
the
members
of
the
coterie
were
professedly
roman
catholics
but
this
made
little
or
no
difference
in
their
intercourse
with
him
what
he
found
in
their
ideals
was
a
substitute
for
religion
a
space
where
his
enthusiasm
might
extend
itself
he
became
as
he
realized
his
own
position
clearly
very
doubtful
whether
he
ought
to
continue
his
college
course
it
did
not
seem
likely
that
he
would
in
the
end
be
able
to
take
holy
orders
and
to
remain
in
the
divinity
school
without
that
intention
was
clearly
foolish
on
the
other
hand
he
shrank
from
inflicting
what
he
knew
would
be
a
painful
disappointment
on
his
father
it
happened
that
before
the
term
ended
his
connection
with
the
divinity
school
was
cut
in
a
way
that
saved
him
from
the
responsibility
of
forming
a
decision
he
was
a
regular
attendant
at
the
lectures
of
spenser
who
had
never
from
the
first
disguised
his
dislike
and
contempt
for
hyacinth
this
gentleman
was
one
day
explaining
to
his
class
the
difference
between
evidence
which
leads
to
a
high
degree
of
probability
and
a
demonstration
which
produces
absolute
certainty
the
subject
was
a
dry
one
and
quite
unsuited
to
spenser
whose
heart
was
set
on
maintaining
a
reputation
for
caustic
wit
he
cast
about
for
an
illustration
which
would
at
once
make
clear
the
distinction
and
enliven
his
lecture
his
eye
lit
upon
hyacinth
upon
whose
cheek
there
still
burned
a
long
red
scar
face
brightened
instance
gentlemen
he
said
i
should
reason
from
the
fact
that
our
friend
conneally
affects
the
society
of
certain
charming
ladies
of
doubtful
reputation
like
miss
goold
to
the
conclusion
that
conneally
is
himself
a
nationalist
i
should
only
have
arrived
at
a
probable
conclusion
the
degree
of
probability
might
be
very
high
still
i
should
have
no
right
to
regard
my
conclusion
as
absolutely
the
class
tittered
delightedly
spenser
proceeded
without
heeding
a
deep
flush
on
face
which
might
have
warned
a
wiser
man
that
an
explosion
was
coming
i
should
then
proceed
to
reason
thus
all
nationalists
are
rebels
and
potential
murderers
conneally
is
a
nationalist
therefore
conneally
is
a
rebel
and
potential
murderer
i
should
assuming
the
truth
of
my
minor
premise
have
arrived
at
a
the
syllogism
was
greeted
with
loud
applause
hyacinth
started
to
his
feet
for
a
time
he
could
only
gasp
for
breath
to
utter
a
reply
and
spenser
secure
in
the
conviction
of
his
own
intellectual
and
social
superiority
to
the
son
of
a
parson
from
connemara
determined
to
pursue
his
prey
conneally
he
asked
with
a
simper
to
impugn
the
accuracy
of
my
induction
or
the
logic
of
my
deduction
the
simper
and
the
number
of
beautiful
long
words
which
spenser
had
succeeded
in
collecting
together
into
one
sentence
provoked
a
sustained
clapping
of
hands
and
stamping
of
feet
from
the
class
hyacinth
rapidly
regained
his
and
was
surprised
at
his
own
coolness
when
he
replied
should
say
sir
that
a
man
who
makes
an
induction
holding
up
a
lady
to
ridicule
is
probably
a
cad
and
that
the
cad
who
makes
a
deduction
confusing
patriotism
with
murder
is
certainly
a
a
report
of
speech
was
handed
to
henry
with
a
suggestion
that
expulsion
from
the
divinity
school
was
the
only
suitable
punishment
hyacinth
did
not
look
forward
with
any
pleasure
to
the
interview
to
which
he
was
summoned
he
was
agreeably
surprised
when
he
entered
the
room
henry
offered
him
a
chair
hear
he
said
his
tone
was
severe
but
a
barely
perceptible
gleam
of
humorous
appreciation
flashed
across
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
you
have
been
exceedingly
insolent
to
know
sir
whether
you
heard
the
whole
story
but
if
you
did
you
will
surely
recognise
that
spenser
was
gratuitously
insulting
to
so
said
henry
recognise
that
but
the
question
is
what
am
i
to
do
with
you
now
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
in
my
place
i
should
like
to
know
your
views
of
the
best
way
out
of
the
hyacinth
was
silent
see
henry
went
on
have
our
divinity
lecturers
called
fools
and
cads
before
their
classes
i
should
be
afraid
myself
to
deliver
a
lecture
in
your
presence
if
i
thought
i
was
liable
to
that
kind
of
think
sir
said
hyacinth
the
best
thing
will
be
for
me
to
leave
the
divinity
think
so
too
but
leaving
our
divinity
school
need
not
mean
that
you
give
up
the
idea
of
taking
holy
orders
i
have
a
very
high
opinion
of
your
abilities
conneally
so
high
that
i
should
not
like
the
church
to
lose
your
services
at
the
same
time
you
are
not
at
present
the
kind
of
man
whom
i
could
possibly
recommend
to
any
irish
bishop
your
nationalist
principles
are
an
absolute
bar
to
your
working
in
the
church
of
wonder
sir
how
you
can
call
our
church
the
church
of
ireland
and
in
the
same
breath
say
that
there
is
no
room
for
a
nationalist
in
her
the
two
things
contradict
each
eyes
twinkled
again
there
spread
over
his
mouth
a
smile
of
tolerant
amusement
dear
boy
not
going
to
let
you
trap
me
into
a
discussion
of
that
question
theoretically
i
have
no
doubt
you
would
make
out
an
excellent
case
national
church
national
spirit
national
politics
irish
church
irish
nation
irish
ideas
they
all
go
excellently
together
they
and
yet
the
facts
are
as
i
state
them
a
nationalist
clergyman
in
the
church
of
ireland
would
be
just
as
impossible
as
an
english
nonconformist
in
the
court
of
louis
quatorze
after
all
in
this
life
one
has
got
to
steer
course
among
facts
and
sharp
things
which
knock
holes
in
the
man
who
disregards
them
now
what
i
propose
to
you
is
this
put
off
your
ordination
for
three
years
or
so
take
up
schoolmastaring
i
will
undertake
to
get
you
a
post
in
an
english
school
your
politics
matter
over
there
because
no
one
will
in
the
least
understand
what
you
mean
work
hard
think
hard
read
hard
mix
with
the
bigger
world
across
the
channel
see
england
and
realize
what
england
is
and
what
her
empire
means
be
angry
with
me
for
saying
that
long
before
the
three
years
are
over
have
come
to
see
that
what
you
call
patriotism
is
nothing
else
than
parochialism
of
a
particularly
narrow
and
uninstructed
kind
then
come
back
here
to
me
and
arrange
for
your
ordination
do
the
best
of
good
work
when
grown
up
a
bit
and
see
you
a
bishop
before
i
shall
always
be
grateful
to
you
said
hyacinth
shall
never
forget
your
kindness
and
the
way
treated
me
but
i
do
what
you
not
going
to
take
no
for
an
answer
said
henry
home
to
the
west
and
think
it
over
talk
to
your
father
about
your
future
write
to
me
if
you
like
about
your
plans
and
remember
my
offer
is
open
six
months
or
a
year
hence
be
the
same
man
then
that
you
are
now
i
mean
in
character
not
afraid
of
your
turning
out
badly
you
may
think
but
sure
not
act
chapter
vii
the
december
afternoon
was
growing
dark
when
the
weary
surmounted
the
last
hill
on
the
road
from
clifden
and
broke
into
a
shambling
trot
down
the
long
straight
stretch
into
carrowkeel
soon
as
the
distance
dwindled
the
lights
which
twinkled
here
and
there
in
the
village
became
distinguishable
this
hyacinth
recognised
it
was
the
great
hanging
lamp
in
the
window
of
shop
that
a
softer
glow
came
from
the
forge
of
killeen
the
smith
that
and
that
fainter
and
more
uncertain
lights
were
from
fires
seen
through
the
open
upper
section
of
cottage
doors
he
could
almost
tell
whose
the
cabins
were
where
they
shone
the
scene
inside
rose
to
the
imagination
a
man
with
ragged
clothes
and
a
pipe
is
squeezed
into
the
stone
nook
beside
the
blazing
turf
the
kettle
hanging
from
its
hook
swings
steaming
beside
him
the
woman
of
the
house
barefooted
sluttish
in
torn
crimson
petticoat
and
gray
bodice
pinned
across
her
breast
moves
the
red
cinders
from
the
lid
of
the
and
peers
at
the
browning
cake
within
babies
toddle
or
crawl
over
the
greasy
floor
the
car
rattled
into
the
village
street
men
whom
he
knew
stopped
it
to
speak
to
him
children
playing
the
last
of
their
games
in
the
fading
light
paused
to
stare
at
him
father
moran
returning
to
his
presbytery
waved
his
hand
and
shouted
a
greeting
he
passed
the
last
house
of
the
village
and
could
see
the
dim
and
riding
at
their
anchors
in
the
bay
out
beyond
them
grim
and
terrible
in
the
twilight
lay
the
hulk
where
the
ice
for
was
stored
the
thick
stump
of
her
one
remaining
mast
made
a
blacker
bar
against
the
black
sky
the
pier
was
deserted
but
he
could
see
the
bulky
stacks
of
piled
on
it
and
hear
the
water
lapping
against
it
along
its
utmost
edge
lay
a
belt
of
gray
white
where
the
waves
broke
as
they
surged
round
it
he
passed
the
pier
and
there
lay
before
him
the
long
hill
that
led
home
the
church
and
the
ruined
school
stood
out
clearly
on
the
skyline
below
them
less
clearly
seen
was
the
rectory
and
hyacinth
noted
that
the
lamp
in
the
kitchen
was
lit
then
the
door
was
opened
and
he
saw
plain
against
the
light
a
figure
his
no
doubt
the
old
man
was
watching
and
listening
perhaps
the
sound
of
the
wheels
reached
him
through
the
evening
air
for
in
a
few
minutes
he
came
out
and
walked
down
the
drive
hyacinth
saw
him
fumble
with
the
fastening
of
the
rickety
gate
and
at
last
open
it
slowly
and
with
difficulty
the
car
reached
a
gap
in
the
loose
stone
wall
a
familiar
gap
for
across
it
lay
a
short
cut
up
a
steeper
part
of
the
hill
which
the
road
went
round
hyacinth
jumped
down
and
ran
up
the
path
in
another
minute
the
greeting
of
father
and
son
was
accomplished
and
the
two
were
walking
towards
the
house
hyacinth
noticed
that
his
father
trembled
and
that
his
feet
stumbled
uncertainly
among
the
loose
stones
and
stiff
weeds
when
they
entered
the
lighted
room
he
saw
that
his
father
seemed
older
many
years
older
than
when
he
had
said
to
him
two
months
before
his
skin
was
very
transparent
his
lips
were
tremulous
his
eyes
after
the
first
long
look
at
his
son
shifted
feebly
to
the
fire
the
table
and
the
floor
dear
son
he
said
thank
god
that
i
have
got
you
safe
home
again
indeed
it
is
good
to
see
you
again
hyacinth
for
it
has
been
very
lonely
while
you
were
away
i
have
not
been
able
to
do
very
much
lately
or
to
go
out
to
the
seashore
as
i
used
to
perhaps
it
is
only
that
i
have
not
cared
to
but
i
have
tried
hard
to
get
everything
ready
for
your
he
looked
round
the
room
with
evident
pride
as
he
spoke
hyacinth
followed
his
gaze
and
it
was
with
a
sense
of
deep
shame
that
he
found
himself
noticing
the
squalor
of
his
home
the
table
was
stained
and
the
books
which
littered
half
of
it
were
thick
with
dust
and
the
earthen
floor
was
damp
and
pitted
here
and
there
so
that
the
chairs
stood
perilously
among
its
inequalities
the
fine
white
powder
of
turf
ashes
lay
thick
upon
the
dresser
the
whitewash
above
the
fireplace
was
blackened
by
the
track
of
the
smoke
that
had
blown
out
of
the
chimney
and
climbed
up
to
the
still
blacker
rafters
of
the
roof
hyacinth
remembered
how
he
and
not
his
father
had
been
accustomed
to
clean
the
room
and
wash
the
cups
and
plates
he
wondered
how
such
matters
had
been
managed
in
his
absence
and
a
great
sense
of
compassion
filled
his
eyes
with
tears
as
he
thought
of
the
painful
struggle
which
the
details
of
life
must
have
brought
upon
his
father
he
noted
the
evident
preparations
for
his
coming
there
were
two
eggs
lying
in
a
saucer
ready
to
be
boiled
a
fresh
loaf
and
this
was
not
the
day
they
got
their
bread
and
a
small
tin
of
cocoa
beside
his
cup
the
hearth
was
piled
with
glowing
turf
and
the
iron
tripod
with
a
saucepan
on
it
stood
surrounded
with
red
coals
some
sense
of
what
hyacinth
was
feeling
passed
into
his
mind
it
all
right
my
son
i
tried
to
make
it
very
nice
for
you
i
wanted
to
get
maggie
cassidy
up
from
the
village
for
the
day
but
her
baby
had
the
and
she
he
took
hand
and
held
it
while
he
spoke
it
looks
poor
to
you
he
went
on
your
college
rooms
and
the
houses
your
friends
live
in
but
your
own
home
son
it
hyacinth
made
a
gulp
at
the
emotion
which
had
brought
him
near
to
tears
splendid
father
simply
splendid
and
now
going
to
boil
those
two
eggs
and
make
the
cocoa
and
have
a
feast
hallo
got
some
jam
jam
and
butter
and
eggs
and
this
is
the
month
of
december
when
hardly
a
hen
laying
or
a
cow
milking
in
the
whole
parish
he
held
up
the
as
he
spoke
it
was
wrapped
in
dingy
red
paper
and
had
a
mouldy
damp
stain
on
one
side
hyacinth
recognised
the
mark
and
remembered
that
he
had
seen
the
identical
pot
on
the
upper
shelf
of
shop
for
years
its
label
bore
an
inscription
only
vaguely
prophetic
of
the
contents
household
right
father
you
are
supporting
home
manufacture
i
declare
i
have
tasted
it
if
it
had
come
from
england
you
see
a
greater
patriot
than
old
conneally
smiled
in
a
feeble
wavering
way
he
seemed
scarcely
to
understand
what
was
being
said
to
him
but
he
found
a
quiet
pleasure
in
the
sound
of
his
voice
he
settled
himself
in
a
chair
by
the
fireside
and
watched
contentedly
while
hyacinth
put
the
eggs
into
the
saucepan
hung
the
kettle
on
its
hook
and
cut
slices
of
bread
then
the
meal
was
eaten
hyacinth
after
his
long
drive
finding
a
relish
even
in
the
household
jam
he
plied
his
father
with
questions
and
heard
what
the
old
man
knew
of
the
gossip
of
the
village
how
thady
durkan
had
broken
his
arm
and
talked
of
giving
up
the
fishing
how
the
police
from
had
found
or
said
they
found
a
behind
the
old
castle
how
a
gaelic
league
organizer
had
come
round
persuading
the
people
to
sing
and
dance
at
the
galway
féis
after
supper
hyacinth
nerved
himself
to
tell
the
story
of
his
term
in
college
and
his
determination
to
leave
the
divinity
school
more
than
once
he
made
an
effort
to
begin
but
the
old
man
who
brightened
a
little
during
their
meal
relapsed
again
into
dreaminess
and
did
not
seem
to
be
listening
to
him
they
pulled
their
chairs
near
to
the
fire
and
conneally
sat
holding
his
hand
fast
sometimes
he
stroked
or
patted
it
gently
but
otherwise
he
seemed
scarcely
to
recognise
that
he
was
not
alone
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
fire
but
they
stared
strangely
as
if
they
saw
something
afar
off
something
not
in
the
room
at
all
there
was
no
response
in
them
when
hyacinth
spoke
and
no
intelligence
from
time
to
time
his
lips
moved
slightly
as
if
they
were
forming
words
but
he
said
nothing
after
awhile
hyacinth
gave
up
the
attempt
to
tell
his
story
and
sat
silent
for
so
long
that
in
the
end
he
was
startled
when
his
father
spoke
my
son
i
have
somewhat
to
say
unto
before
hyacinth
could
reply
to
him
he
continued
the
young
man
answered
and
said
unto
him
and
the
old
man
lifted
up
his
voice
and
said
unto
his
son
that
hath
ears
to
hear
let
him
he
spoke
as
if
he
were
reading
out
of
a
book
some
narrative
from
the
bible
hyacinth
realized
suddenly
that
the
communication
which
was
to
be
made
to
him
had
been
rehearsed
by
his
father
alone
again
and
again
that
statement
question
and
reply
would
follow
each
other
in
due
sequence
from
the
same
lips
he
felt
that
his
father
was
still
rehearsing
and
had
forgotten
the
real
presence
of
his
son
he
grasped
the
hand
that
held
him
and
shook
it
saying
sharply
father
i
am
here
you
know
me
yes
my
son
surely
i
know
you
there
is
something
i
want
to
tell
you
i
have
wanted
to
tell
it
to
you
for
many
days
i
am
glad
that
you
are
here
now
to
listen
to
he
paused
and
hyacinth
feared
that
he
would
relapse
again
into
dreamy
insensibility
but
he
did
not
think
he
said
i
should
like
to
pray
before
i
speak
to
he
knelt
down
as
hyacinth
had
seen
him
kneel
a
thousand
times
before
facing
the
window
now
a
black
uncurtained
square
in
the
whitewashed
wall
what
he
said
was
almost
unintelligible
there
was
no
petition
nor
even
any
sequence
of
ideas
which
could
be
traced
he
poured
forth
a
series
of
ejaculations
expressive
of
intense
and
rapturous
delight
very
strange
to
listen
to
in
such
a
place
and
from
an
old
lips
then
the
language
he
spoke
changed
from
english
into
gaelic
and
there
came
a
kind
of
hymn
of
adoration
his
sentences
followed
each
other
in
metrical
balance
like
the
latin
of
the
old
liturgies
and
suited
themselves
naturally
to
a
subdued
melody
half
chant
half
cry
like
the
mourning
of
the
keeners
round
a
grave
at
last
rising
from
his
knees
he
spoke
and
his
voice
became
wholly
unemotional
devoid
of
fervour
or
excitement
he
told
his
story
as
a
man
might
relate
some
quite
commonplace
incident
of
daily
life
evening
i
was
sitting
here
by
the
fire
just
as
i
always
sit
i
remember
that
the
lamp
was
not
lit
and
that
the
fire
was
low
so
that
there
was
not
much
light
in
the
room
it
came
into
my
mind
that
it
was
just
out
of
such
gloom
that
the
lord
called
samuel
and
i
wished
that
i
was
like
samuel
so
innocent
that
i
could
hear
the
voice
of
the
lord
i
do
not
remember
what
i
thought
of
after
that
perhaps
for
a
time
i
did
not
think
at
all
then
i
felt
that
there
were
arms
about
my
neck
but
not
like
your
arms
hyacinth
when
you
were
a
child
and
clung
to
me
these
were
arms
which
held
me
lovingly
strongly
protectingly
like
do
you
remember
hyacinth
right
hand
is
under
my
head
his
left
hand
doth
embrace
i
sat
quite
still
and
did
not
move
or
speak
or
even
breathe
lest
he
should
go
away
from
me
then
after
a
long
time
i
knew
afterwards
that
the
time
was
long
though
then
it
seemed
only
a
minute
for
the
joy
that
i
had
in
it
he
told
me
i
do
not
mean
that
i
heard
a
voice
or
any
words
i
did
not
hear
i
him
tell
me
the
things
that
are
to
be
the
last
great
fight
the
armageddon
draweth
very
near
all
that
is
good
is
on
one
side
in
the
fight
and
the
captain
over
all
what
is
bad
is
on
the
other
side
all
kinds
of
tyranny
and
greed
and
lust
i
did
not
hear
these
words
but
i
felt
the
things
only
without
any
fear
for
round
me
were
the
everlasting
arms
and
the
battlefield
is
ireland
our
dear
ireland
which
we
love
all
these
centuries
since
the
great
saints
died
he
has
kept
ireland
to
be
his
battlefield
i
understood
then
how
our
people
have
been
saved
from
riches
and
from
power
and
from
the
opportunities
of
lust
that
our
soil
out
of
all
the
world
might
be
fit
for
the
feet
of
the
great
captain
for
the
marching
of
his
horsemen
and
his
chariots
not
even
when
i
knew
all
this
did
i
desire
to
share
in
the
conflict
i
am
old
and
feeble
but
that
is
not
the
reason
why
there
was
no
desire
on
me
for
strength
is
in
his
power
to
give
to
whom
he
wills
i
did
not
desire
it
because
i
was
quite
happy
being
safe
with
for
a
long
time
after
he
ceased
speaking
there
was
silence
for
hyacinth
had
no
comment
to
offer
at
last
the
old
man
spoke
again
is
all
i
have
no
other
word
of
revelation
but
i
have
wondered
since
how
men
are
to
be
disentangled
from
their
parties
and
their
churches
and
their
nations
and
gathered
simply
into
good
and
bad
will
all
men
who
are
good
just
know
the
captain
when
they
see
him
and
range
themselves
with
him
but
why
should
we
think
about
such
things
as
these
doubtless
he
can
order
them
but
you
hyacinth
will
you
be
sure
to
know
the
good
side
from
the
bad
the
captain
from
the
enemy
for
a
long
time
after
he
had
gone
to
bed
hyacinth
lay
awake
haunted
by
his
prophecy
of
an
armageddon
there
was
that
in
his
nature
which
responded
eagerly
to
such
a
call
to
battle
in
the
presence
of
enthusiasm
like
his
or
like
augusta
hyacinth
caught
fire
his
mind
flamed
with
the
idea
of
an
independent
ireland
resplendent
with
her
ancient
glories
he
embraced
no
less
eagerly
the
thought
of
his
battle
and
his
own
part
in
it
groping
for
points
of
contact
between
the
two
enthusiasms
he
caught
at
the
conception
of
the
roman
church
as
the
antichrist
and
her
power
in
ireland
as
the
point
round
which
the
fight
must
rage
then
with
a
sudden
flash
he
saw
not
rome
but
the
british
empire
as
the
embodiment
of
the
power
of
darkness
he
had
learned
to
think
of
it
as
a
force
greedy
materialistic
tyrannous
grossly
hypocritical
what
more
was
required
to
satisfy
the
conception
of
evil
that
he
sought
for
he
remembered
all
that
he
had
ever
heard
from
augusta
goold
and
her
friends
about
the
shameless
trickery
of
english
statesmen
about
the
insatiable
greed
of
the
merchants
about
the
degraded
sensuality
of
the
workers
he
recalled
the
blatant
boastfulness
with
which
english
demagogues
claimed
to
be
the
sole
possessors
of
enlightened
consciences
and
the
tales
of
native
races
exploited
and
annihilated
by
pioneers
of
civilization
advancing
with
bibles
in
their
hands
but
with
all
his
capacity
for
enthusiasm
there
was
a
strain
of
weakness
in
hyacinth
more
than
once
after
the
glories
of
an
independent
ireland
had
been
preached
to
him
he
had
found
himself
growing
suddenly
cold
and
dejected
smitten
by
an
east
wind
of
at
the
time
when
he
first
recognised
the
loftiness
of
his
religion
he
had
revolted
against
being
called
upon
to
adopt
so
fantastic
a
creed
so
now
when
his
mind
grew
weary
with
the
endeavour
to
set
an
armageddon
in
array
he
began
to
wish
for
a
life
of
peaceful
monotony
a
place
to
be
quiet
in
where
no
high
calls
or
imperious
demands
would
come
to
threaten
him
he
ceased
to
toss
to
and
fro
and
gradually
sank
into
a
sleep
it
seemed
to
him
at
the
time
that
he
was
still
awake
held
back
from
slumber
by
the
great
stillness
of
the
country
that
silence
which
disturbs
ears
long
accustomed
to
the
continuous
roar
of
towns
suddenly
he
started
into
perfect
wakefulness
and
felt
that
he
was
in
possession
of
all
his
faculties
the
room
where
he
lay
was
quite
dark
but
he
strained
his
eyes
to
see
something
in
it
he
listened
intently
although
no
sound
whatever
met
his
ears
a
great
overmastering
fear
laid
hold
on
him
he
tried
to
reason
with
himself
insisting
that
there
was
nothing
and
could
be
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
still
the
fear
remained
his
lips
grew
stiff
and
painfully
hot
and
when
he
tried
to
moisten
them
his
tongue
was
dry
and
moved
across
them
raspingly
he
struggled
with
the
terror
that
paralyzed
him
and
by
a
great
effort
raised
his
hand
to
his
forehead
it
was
damp
and
cold
and
the
hair
above
it
was
damp
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
how
much
of
the
night
had
passed
or
even
how
long
he
lay
rigid
unable
to
breathe
without
a
kind
of
pain
but
suddenly
as
it
had
come
the
terror
left
him
left
him
without
any
effort
on
his
part
or
any
reason
that
he
recognised
then
the
window
of
his
room
shook
and
he
heard
outside
the
low
moan
of
the
rising
wind
some
heavy
drops
of
rain
struck
audibly
on
the
roof
and
the
first
gust
of
the
storm
carried
to
his
ears
the
sound
of
waves
beating
on
the
rocks
his
senses
strained
no
more
his
eyes
closed
and
he
sank
quietly
into
a
long
dreamless
sleep
it
was
late
when
he
woke
so
late
that
the
winter
sky
was
fully
lit
the
wind
whose
first
gusts
had
lulled
him
to
sleep
had
risen
to
a
gale
and
the
rain
mixed
with
salt
spray
beat
fiercely
against
his
window
and
on
the
roof
he
listened
expecting
to
hear
his
father
moving
in
the
room
below
but
within
the
house
there
was
no
sound
he
rose
vaguely
anxious
and
without
waiting
to
dress
went
into
the
kitchen
everything
lay
untouched
just
as
he
had
left
it
the
night
before
the
lamp
and
the
remnants
of
the
meal
were
on
the
table
the
two
chairs
stood
side
by
side
before
the
hearth
where
the
fire
which
he
had
covered
up
smouldered
feebly
he
turned
and
went
to
his
room
he
could
not
have
explained
how
it
was
but
when
he
opened
the
door
he
was
not
surprised
to
see
the
old
man
lying
quite
still
dead
upon
the
bed
his
face
was
turned
upwards
and
on
it
was
that
strange
look
of
emotionless
peace
which
rests
very
often
on
the
faces
of
the
dead
it
seemed
to
hyacinth
quite
natural
that
the
soul
as
it
departed
into
unknown
beatitude
should
have
printed
this
for
the
last
expression
on
the
earthly
habitation
which
it
left
behind
he
neither
wondered
nor
at
first
sorrowed
very
much
to
see
his
father
dead
his
sight
was
undimmed
and
his
hands
steady
when
he
closed
the
eyes
and
composed
the
limbs
of
the
body
on
the
bed
afterwards
it
seemed
strange
to
him
that
he
should
have
dressed
quietly
arranged
the
furniture
in
the
kitchen
and
blown
the
fire
into
a
blaze
before
he
went
down
into
the
village
to
tell
his
news
and
seek
for
help
they
buried
æneas
conneally
beside
his
wife
in
the
churchyard
the
fishermen
carried
his
coffin
into
the
church
and
out
again
to
the
grave
father
moran
himself
stood
by
bareheaded
while
the
clergyman
from
clifden
read
the
prayers
and
sprinkled
the
with
the
clay
which
symbolized
the
return
of
earth
to
earth
and
dust
to
dust
in
the
presence
of
death
and
with
the
recollection
of
the
simple
goodness
of
the
man
who
was
gone
priest
and
people
alike
forgot
for
an
hour
the
endless
strife
between
his
creed
and
theirs
chapter
viii
in
connaught
the
upper
middle
classes
clergy
doctors
lawyers
police
officers
bank
officials
and
so
forth
are
all
strangers
in
the
land
each
of
them
looks
forward
to
a
promotion
which
will
enable
him
to
move
to
some
more
congenial
part
of
ireland
a
dublin
suburb
is
the
ideal
residence
failing
that
the
next
best
thing
is
a
country
town
within
easy
reach
of
the
metropolis
most
of
them
sooner
or
later
achieve
a
promotion
but
some
of
them
are
so
unfortunate
as
to
die
in
their
exile
in
either
case
their
furniture
and
effects
are
auctioned
no
one
ever
removes
his
goods
from
connaught
because
the
cost
of
getting
things
to
any
other
part
of
ireland
is
exorbitant
and
also
because
tables
and
chairs
fetch
very
high
prices
at
auctions
thus
it
happens
that
a
certain
historic
interest
attaches
to
the
furniture
of
most
houses
west
of
the
shannon
the
dispensary
doctor
dines
off
a
table
which
once
graced
the
parlour
of
a
parish
priest
the
inspector
of
police
boasts
of
the
price
he
paid
for
his
recently
upholstered
at
the
auction
of
a
departing
bank
manager
the
same
mahogany
frame
having
once
supported
the
portly
person
of
an
protestant
archdeacon
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
the
furniture
originally
imported
no
one
knows
how
into
connaught
must
have
been
of
superlative
quality
articles
whose
pedigree
so
to
speak
can
be
traced
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
are
still
in
daily
use
unimpaired
by
changes
of
scene
and
ownership
an
auction
of
any
importance
is
a
public
holiday
clergy
doctors
lawyers
and
police
officers
gather
to
the
scene
not
unlike
those
beasts
of
prey
of
whom
we
read
that
they
readily
devour
the
remains
of
a
fallen
member
of
their
own
pack
the
natives
also
collect
together
publicans
and
shopkeepers
in
search
of
bargains
in
china
glass
and
farmers
bent
on
purchasing
such
outdoor
property
as
wheelbarrows
scythes
or
harness
when
hyacinth
to
use
the
local
expression
an
shortly
after
his
death
he
was
favoured
with
quite
the
usual
crowd
of
buyers
almost
everyone
with
either
money
or
credit
within
a
radius
of
twenty
miles
came
into
carrowkeel
for
the
occasion
the
presiding
auctioneer
had
done
his
duty
beforehand
by
advertising
old
mouldy
furniture
as
suites
and
his
battered
editions
of
the
classics
as
valuable
library
of
handsomely
bound
it
is
not
likely
that
anyone
was
really
deceived
by
these
announcements
or
expected
to
find
in
the
little
rectory
anything
sumptuous
or
splendid
the
people
assembled
mainly
because
they
were
exceedingly
curious
to
see
the
inside
of
a
house
whose
doors
had
never
been
open
to
them
during
the
lifetime
of
the
owner
it
was
always
possible
besides
that
though
the
upholstered
existed
only
in
the
imagination
treasures
of
silver
spoons
or
candlesticks
plated
upon
copper
might
be
discovered
among
the
effects
of
a
man
who
lived
as
queer
a
life
as
conneally
when
men
and
women
put
themselves
to
a
great
deal
of
inconvenience
to
attend
an
auction
they
do
not
like
to
return
a
day
is
more
obviously
wasted
if
one
goes
home
with
nothing
to
show
than
if
one
brings
a
table
or
a
bedstead
purchased
at
twice
its
proper
value
thus
the
bidding
at
auction
was
brisk
and
the
prices
such
as
gave
sincere
satisfaction
to
the
auctioneer
everything
was
sold
except
valuable
it
was
in
vain
that
the
auctioneer
made
personal
appeals
to
father
moran
and
the
rector
of
clifden
as
presumably
the
two
most
learned
gentlemen
present
neither
of
them
wanted
the
venerable
classics
in
fact
neither
of
them
could
have
read
a
line
of
the
crooked
greek
type
or
construed
a
page
of
the
latin
authors
even
the
irish
books
in
spite
of
the
gaelic
revival
found
no
purchasers
when
all
was
over
hyacinth
wheeled
them
away
in
barrowfuls
wondering
greatly
what
he
was
to
do
with
them
indeed
the
disposal
of
his
library
was
not
the
chief
of
his
perplexities
he
wondered
also
what
he
was
to
do
with
himself
when
the
auctioneer
sent
in
his
cheque
and
the
london
committee
of
the
mission
had
paid
over
certain
arrears
of
salary
hyacinth
found
himself
the
possessor
of
nearly
two
hundred
pounds
it
seemed
to
him
quite
a
large
fortune
amply
sufficient
to
start
life
with
if
only
some
suitable
way
of
employing
brains
energy
and
money
would
suggest
itself
in
order
to
consider
the
important
topic
at
his
leisure
he
hired
the
only
lodging
in
carrowkeel
the
apartment
it
was
both
bed
and
sitting
room
over
the
furniture
had
suffered
during
the
tenancy
of
a
series
of
congested
districts
board
officials
an
engineer
who
went
to
sleep
in
the
evenings
over
the
fire
had
burnt
a
round
hole
in
the
hearthrug
an
instructor
in
a
hilarious
young
man
had
cracked
the
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
and
broken
many
ornaments
including
the
fellow
of
the
large
china
dog
which
now
mourned
its
mate
on
the
sideboard
other
gentlemen
had
been
responsible
for
dislocating
the
legs
of
two
chairs
and
a
disorganization
of
the
handle
which
made
it
impossible
to
shut
the
door
from
the
inside
the
chief
glory
of
the
apartment
however
still
remained
a
document
signed
by
earl
spencer
then
lord
lieutenant
ordering
the
arrest
of
the
present
father
as
a
person
dangerous
to
the
commonwealth
the
first
thing
which
brought
meditations
to
a
definite
point
was
a
letter
he
received
from
henry
do
not
know
the
professor
wrote
of
course
i
do
not
wish
to
inquire
how
you
are
situated
financially
but
if
as
i
suppose
is
likely
you
are
obliged
in
the
near
future
to
earn
your
living
i
may
perhaps
be
of
some
help
to
you
you
have
taken
your
degree
and
are
so
far
qualified
either
to
accept
a
post
as
a
schoolmaster
in
an
english
preparatory
school
or
to
seek
ordination
from
some
bishop
as
you
are
probably
aware
none
of
our
irish
bishops
will
accept
a
man
who
has
not
completed
his
divinity
course
several
english
bishops
however
especially
in
the
northern
province
are
willing
to
ordain
men
who
have
nothing
more
than
a
university
degree
always
supposing
that
they
pass
the
required
examination
i
shall
be
quite
willing
to
give
you
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
one
of
these
bishops
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
a
curacy
could
be
found
for
you
in
one
of
the
northern
manufacturing
towns
where
you
would
have
an
ample
sphere
for
useful
the
letter
went
on
to
urge
the
advisability
of
suppressing
disguising
or
modifying
his
political
opinions
which
stated
nakedly
were
likely
to
beget
a
certain
prejudice
in
the
episcopal
mind
and
in
any
case
would
be
quite
out
of
place
among
the
operatives
of
yorkshire
or
lancashire
hyacinth
recognised
and
appreciated
kindness
he
even
tried
to
bring
himself
to
consider
the
offer
seriously
and
carefully
but
it
was
no
use
he
could
not
conceive
himself
as
likely
to
be
either
useful
or
happy
amid
the
hustling
commercialism
of
the
manchester
streets
or
the
staid
proprieties
of
an
anglican
vicarage
after
he
had
spent
about
a
week
in
his
new
lodging
father
moran
called
on
him
the
priest
sat
beside
the
fire
for
more
than
an
hour
chatting
in
a
desultory
manner
he
drank
tea
and
smoked
and
it
was
not
until
he
rose
to
go
that
the
real
object
of
his
visit
appeared
know
what
thinking
of
doing
conneally
and
maybe
no
right
to
have
the
least
objection
to
telling
you
said
hyacinth
i
knew
myself
but
i
my
mind
made
the
priest
put
down
his
hat
again
and
settled
himself
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
hyacinth
sat
down
and
during
the
pause
which
followed
contemplated
the
wonderful
number
and
variety
of
the
stains
on
the
black
waistcoat
in
front
of
him
given
up
the
idea
of
finishing
your
divinity
course
said
the
priest
not
blaming
you
in
the
least
men
that
studying
suits
and
men
that
it
i
never
was
much
of
a
one
for
books
he
sighed
heavily
perhaps
at
the
recollection
of
his
own
struggles
with
the
mysteries
of
theology
in
his
maynooth
student
days
then
he
walked
over
and
closed
the
door
returned
drew
a
chair
close
to
hyacinth
and
spoke
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
imparts
an
important
secret
you
hear
that
thady
giving
up
the
fishing
since
he
broke
his
arm
he
declares
never
step
aboard
the
boat
again
you
know
the
bridget
not
one
of
the
biggest
boats
but
a
very
lucky
one
she
made
over
five
hundred
pounds
last
year
besides
the
share
the
board
took
she
was
built
at
baltimore
and
the
board
spent
over
two
hundred
pounds
on
her
nets
and
gear
and
all
only
one
year
more
of
instalments
to
pay
off
the
price
of
her
and
thady
has
the
rest
of
the
men
bought
out
nobody
owns
a
stick
or
a
net
or
a
sail
of
her
except
himself
barring
of
course
due
to
the
hyacinth
was
sufficiently
acquainted
with
the
system
on
which
the
congested
districts
board
provides
the
connaught
fishermen
with
boats
and
nets
to
understand
father
rather
involved
statement
of
financial
position
he
did
not
yet
grasp
why
all
this
information
should
have
been
conveyed
to
him
in
such
a
solemn
and
mysterious
tone
might
have
the
said
the
priest
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
he
paused
to
let
the
full
glory
of
the
situation
lay
hold
upon
hyacinth
perhaps
he
expected
an
outburst
of
delight
and
surprise
but
none
came
you
he
said
others
looking
for
her
the
men
that
worked
with
thady
are
thinking
of
making
him
an
offer
and
i
dare
say
the
board
would
be
glad
enough
to
have
the
boat
owned
among
them
but
i
can
put
in
a
word
myself
both
with
thady
and
the
inspector
faith
the
times
is
changed
since
i
was
a
young
man
i
can
remember
when
a
priest
was
no
more
thought
of
than
a
barefooted
gossure
out
of
a
bog
and
now
there
a
spalpeen
of
a
government
inspector
but
lifts
his
hat
to
me
in
the
street
oh
a
note
from
me
will
go
a
good
way
with
the
board
and
not
miss
the
chance
for
want
of
my
good
word
i
promise
you
you
said
hyacinth
you
a
good
thing
to
be
made
out
of
her
but
sure
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
do
myself
and
maybe
better
what
do
you
say
now
think
it
over
said
hyacinth
whatever
comes
of
it
be
greatly
obliged
to
be
delaying
too
long
and
look
you
his
voice
sank
almost
to
a
whisper
be
talking
about
what
said
to
you
people
are
queer
and
if
father
joyce
down
in
clifden
came
to
hear
that
i
was
working
for
a
protestant
be
sure
to
go
talking
to
the
archbishop
and
never
get
to
the
end
of
the
fuss
that
would
be
very
good
of
you
especially
considering
who
i
am
i
mean
my
father
being
a
convert
and
no
more
said
the
priest
no
more
your
father
was
a
good
man
catholic
or
protestant
not
one
of
these
bitter
kind
of
priests
conneally
i
can
be
a
good
catholic
without
hating
my
neighbours
i
hold
with
all
this
bullyragging
in
newspapers
about
and
maybe
the
reason
that
stuck
down
here
at
the
other
end
of
nowhere
all
my
life
and
never
got
promotion
or
praise
but
what
do
i
care
as
long
as
they
let
me
alone
to
do
my
work
for
the
people
not
afraid
to
say
it
to
you
conneally
for
you
want
to
get
me
into
trouble
but
my
belief
that
many
of
our
priests
would
rather
have
grand
churches
than
contented
people
fonder
of
rome
than
they
are
of
father
moran
said
hyacinth
smiling
you
go
on
like
this
i
shall
expect
to
hear
of
your
turning
forbid
conneally
i
wish
you
well
i
wish
you
to
be
here
among
us
and
to
be
prosperous
but
the
dearest
wish
of
my
heart
for
you
is
that
i
might
see
you
back
in
the
catholic
church
believing
the
creed
of
your
the
suggestion
attracted
hyacinth
a
great
deal
more
than
he
liked
the
sea
and
the
fishing
and
he
loved
the
simple
people
among
whom
he
had
been
brought
up
his
experiences
in
dublin
had
not
encouraged
him
to
be
ambitious
life
in
the
great
world
it
was
thus
that
he
thought
of
the
bickerings
of
the
dublin
nationalists
and
the
schoolboy
enthusiasms
of
college
students
was
not
a
very
simple
thing
there
was
a
complexity
and
a
confusion
in
affairs
which
made
it
difficult
to
hold
to
any
cause
devotedly
it
seemed
to
him
looking
back
that
miss
ideals
and
she
had
ideals
as
he
knew
were
somehow
vulgarized
in
their
contact
with
the
actual
he
had
seen
something
of
the
joy
she
found
in
her
conflict
with
and
it
did
not
seem
to
him
to
be
pure
or
ennobling
at
one
time
he
was
on
the
verge
of
deciding
to
do
what
the
priest
wished
walking
day
by
day
along
the
shore
or
through
the
fields
he
came
to
think
that
life
might
very
well
be
spent
without
ambitious
or
extended
hopes
in
quiet
toil
and
unexciting
pleasures
what
held
him
back
was
the
recollection
which
never
ceased
to
haunt
him
of
his
prophecy
the
thought
of
the
great
fight
declared
to
be
imminent
stirred
in
him
an
emotion
so
strong
that
the
peace
and
monotony
he
half
desired
became
impossible
he
never
made
it
clear
to
himself
that
he
either
believed
or
disbelieved
the
prediction
he
certainly
did
not
expect
to
see
an
actual
gathering
of
armed
men
or
that
ireland
was
to
be
the
scene
of
a
battle
like
those
in
south
africa
but
there
was
in
him
a
conviction
that
ireland
was
awakening
out
of
a
long
sleep
was
stretching
her
limbs
in
preparation
for
activity
he
felt
the
quiver
of
a
national
strenuousness
which
was
already
shaking
loose
the
knots
of
the
old
of
prejudice
and
cowardice
it
seemed
to
him
that
bone
was
coming
to
dry
bone
and
that
sooner
or
later
very
soon
it
was
likely
one
would
breathe
on
these
and
they
would
live
that
contest
should
come
out
of
such
a
renaissance
was
inevitable
but
what
contest
against
whom
was
the
new
ireland
to
fight
and
who
was
truly
on
her
side
here
was
the
puzzle
insoluble
but
insistent
it
would
not
let
him
rest
recurring
to
his
mind
with
each
fresh
recollection
of
his
prophecy
it
was
while
he
was
wearying
himself
with
this
perplexity
that
he
got
a
letter
from
augusta
goold
it
was
characteristic
of
her
that
she
had
written
no
word
of
sympathy
when
she
heard
of
his
death
and
now
when
a
letter
did
come
it
contained
no
allusion
to
affairs
she
told
him
with
evident
delight
that
she
had
enlisted
no
less
than
ten
recruits
for
the
boer
army
she
had
collected
sufficient
money
to
equip
them
and
pay
their
travelling
expenses
it
was
arranged
that
they
were
to
proceed
to
paris
and
there
join
a
body
of
volunteers
organized
by
a
french
officer
a
certain
pierre
de
villeneuve
about
whom
miss
goold
was
enthusiastic
she
was
in
communication
with
an
irishman
who
seemed
likely
to
be
a
suitable
captain
for
her
little
band
and
she
wanted
hyacinth
back
in
dublin
to
help
her
know
she
wrote
people
i
have
round
me
here
poor
old
grealy
is
quite
impracticable
though
he
means
well
he
talks
about
nothing
but
the
fianna
and
finn
mccool
and
see
that
my
fellows
must
have
riding
lessons
and
must
be
got
somehow
to
understand
the
mechanism
of
a
rifle
tim
halloran
has
been
in
a
sulk
ever
since
i
told
him
what
i
thought
of
his
conduct
at
the
rotunda
he
never
comes
near
me
and
mary
told
me
the
other
day
that
he
called
my
volunteers
a
of
i
dare
say
perfectly
true
but
a
finer
kind
of
blackguard
than
the
sodden
loafers
the
english
recruit
for
their
miserable
she
went
on
to
describe
the
series
of
boer
victories
which
had
come
one
after
another
just
at
she
was
confident
that
the
cause
of
freedom
and
nationality
would
ultimately
triumph
and
she
foresaw
the
intervention
of
some
continental
power
a
great
blow
would
be
struck
at
the
already
tottering
british
empire
and
then
the
freedom
of
ireland
hyacinth
felt
strangely
excited
as
he
read
her
news
the
letter
seemed
the
first
clear
note
of
the
trumpet
summoning
him
to
his
armageddon
politics
and
squabbling
at
home
might
be
inglorious
and
degrading
but
the
actual
war
which
was
being
waged
in
south
africa
the
struggle
of
a
people
for
existence
and
liberty
could
be
nothing
but
noble
he
saw
quite
clearly
what
his
own
next
step
was
to
be
and
there
was
no
temptation
to
hesitate
about
it
he
would
place
his
money
at
miss
disposal
and
go
himself
with
her
ten
volunteers
to
join
the
brigade
of
the
heroic
de
villeneuve
chapter
ix
the
prospect
of
joining
augusta
band
of
volunteers
and
going
to
south
africa
to
fight
afforded
hyacinth
great
satisfaction
for
two
days
he
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
and
delightful
anticipations
he
had
no
knowledge
whatever
of
the
actual
conditions
of
modern
warfare
he
understood
vaguely
that
he
would
be
called
upon
to
endure
great
hardships
he
liked
to
think
of
these
picturing
himself
bravely
cheerful
through
long
periods
of
hunger
heat
or
cold
he
had
visions
of
night
watches
of
sudden
alarms
of
skirmishes
of
scouting
work
and
stealthy
approaches
to
the
lines
he
thought
out
the
details
of
critical
interviews
with
commanding
officers
in
which
he
with
some
chosen
comrade
volunteered
for
incredibly
dangerous
enterprises
he
conceived
of
himself
as
wounded
though
not
fatally
and
carried
to
the
rear
out
of
some
he
was
just
years
of
age
adventure
had
its
fascination
and
the
world
was
still
a
place
full
of
splendid
possibilities
at
the
end
of
his
two
days
of
dreaming
he
returned
flushed
with
his
great
purposes
to
the
realities
of
life
he
went
to
father
moran
to
tell
him
that
he
would
not
buy
boat
he
laughed
to
himself
at
the
thought
of
doing
such
a
thing
was
he
to
spend
his
life
fishing
mackerel
round
the
rocky
islands
of
connemara
when
he
might
be
fighting
like
one
of
the
ancient
heroes
giving
his
strength
perhaps
his
life
for
a
great
cause
the
priest
met
him
at
the
presbytery
door
in
conneally
come
in
and
sit
down
i
was
expecting
you
these
two
days
what
were
you
doing
at
all
walking
away
there
along
the
rocks
by
yourself
the
people
were
beginning
to
say
that
you
were
getting
to
be
like
your
poor
father
and
that
ever
get
any
good
out
of
you
but
i
knew
come
back
to
me
here
i
hope
now
to
tell
me
that
buy
the
boat
they
entered
the
house
and
the
priest
opened
the
door
of
the
little
hyacinth
knew
it
well
there
was
the
dark
mahogany
table
with
the
marks
burnt
into
it
where
hot
dishes
were
set
down
the
shabby
the
worn
on
the
floor
the
dozen
or
so
books
in
the
hanging
shelf
the
tawdry
sacred
pictures
round
the
wall
he
had
known
it
all
and
it
all
seemed
unchanged
since
he
was
a
child
you
down
sit
you
down
said
the
priest
now
about
the
not
going
in
for
her
said
hyacinth
as
thankful
to
you
for
suggesting
it
as
if
i
did
buy
her
i
hope
understand
that
but
not
going
to
buy
he
found
it
difficult
to
speak
of
his
new
plan
to
father
moran
you
tell
me
that
now
sorry
for
it
and
why
you
buy
her
there
to
hinder
you
hyacinth
hesitated
now
said
the
priest
can
guess
i
thought
the
auction
turned
out
well
for
you
but
i
never
heard
for
certain
and
maybe
you
got
the
money
for
the
boat
whisht
now
my
son
and
let
me
speak
thinking
the
thing
might
be
father
moran
now
will
you
be
quiet
when
i
bid
you
i
the
money
myself
never
a
penny
have
i
been
able
to
save
all
my
life
with
the
calls
there
are
on
me
in
a
parish
like
this
sure
you
know
yourself
how
it
is
one
will
have
a
cow
that
has
died
on
him
and
another
will
be
wanting
a
lock
of
potatoes
for
seed
in
the
springtime
and
if
it
that
be
something
else
and
who
would
the
creatures
go
to
in
their
trouble
but
the
old
priest
that
christened
and
married
the
most
of
them
but
indeed
thanks
be
to
god
things
is
improving
the
fishing
brings
in
a
lot
of
money
to
the
men
and
a
better
breed
of
cattle
in
the
country
now
and
the
pigs
fetch
a
good
price
since
we
had
the
railway
to
clifden
and
maybe
the
last
few
years
i
might
have
saved
a
little
but
i
indeed
i
know
where
it
is
the
money
goes
at
all
but
someway
never
at
rest
in
my
breeches
pockets
till
up
and
off
somewhere
god
forgive
us
more
careful
we
ought
to
father
moran
i
then
will
you
cease
your
talking
for
one
minute
and
let
me
get
a
word
in
edgeways
for
your
own
good
what
was
i
saying
oh
i
was
just
after
telling
you
i
got
the
money
to
help
you
but
maybe
i
might
manage
to
get
it
the
man
in
the
bank
in
clifden
knows
me
i
borrowed
a
few
pounds
off
him
two
years
ago
when
the
house
and
three
more
beside
it
got
blown
away
in
the
big
wind
father
joyce
put
his
name
on
the
back
of
the
bill
along
with
my
own
and
trouble
enough
i
had
to
get
him
to
do
it
for
he
said
i
ought
to
put
an
appeal
in
the
newspapers
and
get
the
money
given
to
me
but
i
never
was
one
to
go
begging
round
the
country
i
said
rather
borrow
the
money
and
pay
it
back
like
a
decent
man
and
so
i
did
every
penny
of
it
and
i
think
the
bank
will
trust
me
now
with
just
your
name
and
mine
more
especially
as
to
buy
a
boat
we
want
the
money
what
do
you
say
to
that
now
he
looked
at
hyacinth
triumphantly
moran
too
good
to
me
too
good
altogether
what
did
ever
i
do
to
deserve
such
kindness
from
you
but
all
wrong
got
plenty
of
why
in
the
name
of
all
holy
you
tell
me
so
at
once
and
not
keep
me
standing
here
twisting
my
brains
into
hard
knots
with
thinking
out
ways
of
getting
what
you
want
if
got
the
money
buy
the
boat
what
better
could
you
do
with
it
i
want
to
buy
the
boat
i
want
to
live
here
always
going
away
out
into
the
world
i
want
to
see
things
and
do
into
the
world
will
you
listen
to
the
boy
is
it
america
thinking
of
ah
now
enough
gone
out
and
left
us
lonely
here
the
best
of
all
the
boys
and
girls
going
to
work
for
the
strangers
in
the
strange
land
and
why
would
you
be
going
after
them
not
going
to
america
going
to
south
africa
going
to
join
some
young
irishmen
to
fight
for
the
boers
and
for
going
out
to
fight
to
fight
for
the
boers
what
is
it
in
your
head
at
all
hyacinth
conneally
tell
me
again
hyacinth
hesitated
was
it
possible
to
give
utterance
to
the
thoughts
and
hopes
which
filled
his
mind
could
he
tell
anyone
about
the
furious
fancies
of
the
last
few
days
or
of
that
weird
vision
of
his
which
lay
at
the
back
of
what
he
felt
and
dreamed
could
he
even
speak
of
the
enthusiasm
which
moved
him
to
devote
himself
to
the
cause
of
freedom
and
a
threatened
nationality
in
the
presence
of
a
man
of
the
world
the
very
effort
to
express
himself
would
have
acted
as
some
corrosive
acid
and
stained
with
patches
of
absurdity
the
whole
fabric
of
his
dreams
he
looked
at
father
moran
and
saw
the
eyes
lit
with
sympathy
he
knew
that
he
had
a
listener
who
would
not
scoff
who
might
perhaps
even
understand
he
began
to
speak
slowly
and
haltingly
at
first
then
more
rapidly
at
last
he
poured
out
with
breathless
incoherent
speed
the
strange
story
of
the
armageddon
vision
the
hopes
that
were
in
him
the
fierce
enthusiasm
the
passionate
love
for
ireland
which
burnt
in
his
soul
he
was
not
conscious
of
the
gaping
inconsequences
of
his
train
of
emotion
he
did
not
recognise
how
ridiculous
it
was
to
connect
the
boer
war
with
the
apocalyptic
battle
of
the
saints
or
the
utter
impossibility
of
getting
either
one
or
the
other
into
any
sort
of
relation
with
the
existing
condition
of
ireland
a
casual
observer
might
have
supposed
that
hyacinth
had
made
a
mistake
in
telling
his
story
to
father
moran
a
smile
threatening
actual
laughter
hovered
visibly
round
the
mouth
his
eyes
had
a
shrewd
searching
expression
difficult
to
interpret
still
he
listened
to
the
rhapsody
without
interrupting
it
till
hyacinth
stopped
abruptly
smitten
with
sudden
terrified
of
imminent
ridicule
nor
were
the
first
words
reassuring
say
now
hyacinth
conneally
but
there
might
be
the
makings
of
a
fine
man
in
you
might
have
known
said
hyacinth
angrily
laugh
at
me
i
was
a
fool
to
tell
you
at
all
but
in
earnest
about
what
going
to
do
whatever
you
may
think
about
the
rest
no
laughing
at
just
wrong
then
for
i
laughing
nor
meaning
to
laugh
at
all
god
forbid
that
i
should
laugh
at
you
and
i
meant
it
when
i
said
that
there
was
the
makings
of
a
fine
man
in
you
laugh
at
you
little
you
know
me
listen
now
till
i
tell
you
something
but
you
be
repeating
it
this
must
be
between
you
and
me
and
go
no
further
i
was
very
much
of
your
way
of
thinking
myself
hyacinth
gazed
at
him
in
astonishment
the
thought
of
father
moran
elderly
rotund
kindly
of
father
moran
with
in
his
pocket
for
the
and
a
quaint
jest
on
his
lips
for
their
mothers
of
father
moran
in
his
ruffled
silk
hat
and
shabby
black
coat
and
baggy
trousers
of
this
father
moran
mounted
and
armed
facing
the
british
infantry
in
south
africa
was
wholly
grotesque
he
laughed
aloud
yourself
that
has
the
bad
manners
to
be
laughing
now
said
the
priest
small
blame
to
you
if
it
was
out
to
the
boers
i
was
thinking
of
going
the
gray
goose
out
there
on
the
road
might
laugh
and
the
solemnest
mortal
i
know
at
the
notion
of
me
charging
along
with
maybe
a
pike
in
my
hand
and
the
few
gray
hairs
left
on
the
sides
of
my
head
blowing
about
in
the
breeze
make
as
i
went
prancing
to
and
fro
but
not
what
i
meant
when
i
said
that
once
upon
a
time
i
was
something
of
your
way
of
thinking
and
sure
enough
i
was
but
a
long
time
ago
he
sighed
and
for
a
minute
or
two
he
said
no
more
hyacinth
began
to
wonder
what
he
meant
and
whether
the
promised
confidence
would
be
forthcoming
at
all
then
the
priest
went
on
i
was
a
young
man
and
hard
for
you
to
think
it
but
i
was
a
fine
young
man
never
a
better
lad
at
the
hurling
than
i
was
me
a
doddering
old
soggarth
now
when
i
was
a
boy
as
telling
you
there
was
a
deal
of
going
to
and
fro
in
the
country
and
meetings
at
night
and
drillings
too
and
plenty
of
talk
of
a
rising
no
less
little
good
came
of
it
that
ever
i
saw
but
not
blaming
the
men
that
was
in
it
they
were
good
men
hyacinth
conneally
men
that
would
have
given
the
souls
out
of
their
bodies
for
the
sake
of
ireland
they
would
sure
for
they
loved
ireland
well
but
i
had
my
own
share
in
the
doings
of
course
it
was
before
ever
there
was
a
word
of
my
being
a
priest
that
came
after
thanks
be
to
god
for
his
the
old
man
crossed
himself
reverently
kept
me
from
harm
and
the
sin
that
might
have
been
laid
on
me
but
in
those
days
there
were
great
thoughts
in
me
just
as
there
are
in
you
faith
of
opinion
that
my
thoughts
were
greater
than
yours
for
i
was
all
for
fighting
here
in
ireland
for
the
poor
old
woman
herself
and
out
to
some
foreign
war
be
going
to
fight
for
people
not
friends
of
yours
by
so
much
as
one
drop
still
the
feeling
in
you
is
the
same
as
the
feeling
that
was
in
me
not
a
doubt
of
it
but
indeed
so
far
as
concerned
over
and
gone
i
spoken
to
a
mortal
soul
about
such
things
these
thirty
years
and
i
be
doing
it
now
only
just
to
show
you
that
the
last
man
in
ireland
that
would
laugh
at
you
for
what
told
glad
i
told
you
in
my
heart
said
hyacinth
like
to
think
i
had
your
blessing
with
me
when
i
you
get
it
said
father
moran
i
tell
you
straight
give
you
no
blessing
when
going
away
out
of
the
country
just
when
need
of
every
man
in
it
i
tell
you
this
and
remember
that
i
know
what
talking
about
not
men
that
fight
who
will
help
ireland
but
men
that
will
said
hyacinth
what
work
is
there
for
a
man
like
me
to
do
in
ireland
i
offer
you
the
chance
of
buying
thady
boat
there
work
enough
for
any
man
in
her
not
the
sort
of
work
i
ought
to
be
doing
what
good
would
it
be
to
anyone
but
myself
what
good
would
it
be
to
ireland
if
i
caught
boatloads
of
mackerel
be
making
light
of
the
mackerel
now
a
good
fish
if
you
get
him
fresh
and
split
him
down
and
fry
him
with
a
lump
of
butter
in
the
pan
worse
fish
than
the
mackerel
as
discover
if
you
go
to
south
africa
and
find
yourself
living
on
a
bit
of
some
ancient
tough
beast
of
an
ostrich
or
whatever
it
may
happen
to
be
that
they
eat
out
in
his
exalted
mood
hyacinth
felt
insulted
at
the
praise
of
the
mackerel
and
the
laughter
in
the
eyes
when
he
suggested
a
dinner
off
ostrich
he
held
out
his
hand
and
said
now
wait
said
the
priest
be
in
such
a
tearing
hurry
talk
as
serious
as
you
like
and
not
hurt
your
feelings
if
stay
for
a
minute
or
two
listen
now
the
language
dying
on
the
lips
talking
the
english
more
and
more
of
them
every
day
and
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
when
they
lose
their
irish
lose
half
the
good
in
them
what
sort
will
the
next
generation
of
our
people
be
with
their
own
language
gone
from
them
and
their
irish
ways
forgotten
and
all
the
old
tales
and
songs
and
tunes
perished
away
like
the
froth
of
the
waves
that
the
storm
blew
up
across
the
fields
the
night
your
father
died
tell
you
what
be
just
sham
englishmen
and
the
lord
knows
the
real
thing
is
not
the
best
kind
of
man
in
the
world
but
the
copy
of
an
englishman
sure
the
poorest
creature
to
be
found
anywhere
on
the
face
of
good
earth
and
what
be
when
the
irish
is
gone
from
us
there
be
work
enough
for
you
to
do
now
if
you
were
to
buy
thady
boat
and
stay
here
and
help
to
keep
the
people
to
the
old
tongue
and
the
old
ways
hyacinth
shook
his
head
his
mood
was
altogether
too
heroic
to
allow
him
to
think
highly
of
what
the
priest
said
to
him
he
loved
the
irish
language
as
his
native
speech
loved
it
too
as
a
symbol
and
something
more
perhaps
as
an
expression
of
the
nationality
of
ireland
but
it
did
not
seem
to
him
to
be
a
very
essential
thing
and
to
spend
his
life
talking
it
and
persuading
other
people
to
talk
it
was
an
obscure
kind
of
patriotism
which
made
no
strong
appeal
to
him
which
indeed
could
not
stand
compared
to
the
glory
of
drawing
the
sword
listened
to
what
told
you
father
moran
and
you
say
that
you
understand
what
i
feel
but
i
think
you
really
do
or
else
you
fancy
that
i
could
be
satisfied
to
stay
here
what
is
it
you
ask
of
me
to
spend
my
time
fishing
and
talking
irish
and
dancing
jigs
ah
well
enough
like
to
do
it
think
that
such
a
life
be
pleasant
to
me
it
would
be
too
pleasant
the
matter
with
it
a
temptation
and
not
a
duty
that
setting
before
it
is
now
maybe
it
is
and
if
that
way
you
think
of
it
right
enough
to
say
no
to
me
but
for
all
that
i
understand
you
well
enough
this
now
coming
up
to
the
house
to
see
me
he
went
over
to
the
window
and
looked
out
it
a
queer
life
a
priest
lives
in
a
place
like
this
with
never
a
minute
of
quiet
peace
from
morning
to
night
but
somebody
will
be
coming
interrupting
and
destroying
it
first
you
hyacinth
conneally
not
that
i
grudge
the
time
to
you
when
going
off
so
soon
and
now
michael
kavanagh
indeed
a
decent
man
too
like
yourself
come
in
michael
come
in
be
standing
there
pulling
at
the
old
you
know
as
well
as
myself
broken
these
two
years
heartbroken
the
thing
is
ever
since
that
congested
engineer
put
up
the
electric
bell
for
me
and
little
use
that
was
seeing
that
biddy
my
housekeeper
conneally
you
remember
her
poured
a
jug
of
hot
water
into
its
inside
the
way
it
annoy
her
with
ringing
so
loud
and
why
the
noise
of
it
vexed
her
i
say
for
as
deaf
as
a
post
every
time
i
speak
to
her
ah
there
michael
are
you
now
what
do
you
want
a
young
farmer
tall
and
straight
stood
in
the
doorway
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
he
had
brought
a
paper
for
father
signature
it
related
to
a
bull
which
the
congested
districts
board
proposed
to
lend
to
the
parish
and
of
which
kavanagh
had
been
chosen
to
be
custodian
a
long
conversation
followed
conducted
in
irish
the
habitation
for
the
animal
was
discussed
then
the
best
method
of
bringing
him
home
from
clifden
station
then
the
kind
of
beast
he
was
likely
to
turn
out
to
be
and
the
suitability
of
particular
breeds
of
cattle
to
the
coarse
land
of
carrowkeel
kavanagh
related
a
fearful
tale
of
a
lot
of
fowls
which
had
been
planted
in
the
neighbourhood
by
the
board
they
were
particularly
nice
to
look
at
and
settings
of
their
eggs
were
eagerly
booked
long
beforehand
then
one
by
one
they
sickened
and
died
some
people
thought
they
died
out
of
spite
being
angered
at
the
way
they
had
been
treated
in
the
train
kavanagh
himself
did
not
think
so
badly
of
them
he
was
of
opinion
that
their
spirits
were
desolated
in
them
with
the
way
the
rain
came
through
the
roof
of
their
house
and
that
their
feet
got
sore
with
walking
on
the
unaccustomed
however
their
death
was
to
be
explained
he
hoped
that
the
bull
would
turn
out
to
be
hardier
father
moran
on
his
part
hoped
that
the
roof
of
the
house
would
turn
out
to
be
sounder
in
the
end
the
paper
was
signed
and
kavanagh
departed
there
said
the
priest
a
fine
young
man
only
for
him
i
know
how
get
on
in
the
parish
at
all
got
a
head
on
his
shoulders
and
a
notion
of
improving
himself
and
his
neighbours
and
it
would
do
you
good
to
see
him
dance
a
jig
but
why
need
i
tell
you
that
when
seen
him
yourself
he
is
to
be
the
secretary
of
the
gaelic
league
when
we
get
a
branch
of
it
started
in
carrowkeel
and
a
good
secretary
make
for
his
heart
will
be
in
the
work
i
dare
say
now
heard
of
the
league
when
you
were
up
in
dublin
well
hear
more
of
it
by
the
time
back
here
again
now
be
saying
that
not
come
back
give
you
a
year
to
get
sick
of
fighting
for
the
boers
and
then
be
a
hunger
on
you
for
the
old
place
that
will
bring
you
back
to
it
in
spite
of
father
moran
whatever
happens
to
me
not
forget
carrowkeel
nor
you
either
been
good
to
me
and
if
i
take
your
advice
and
stay
where
i
am
not
through
want
of
the
priest
wrung
his
hand
come
back
it
may
be
after
dead
and
gone
but
back
come
here
or
somewhere
else
in
the
old
country
spend
your
days
working
for
ireland
because
have
learnt
that
working
is
better
than
chapter
x
when
hyacinth
got
back
to
dublin
about
the
middle
of
february
the
streets
were
gay
with
amateur
warriors
the
fever
for
volunteering
which
laid
hold
on
the
middle
classes
after
the
series
of
regrettable
incidents
of
the
winter
raged
violently
among
the
irish
loyalists
nowhere
were
the
recruiting
officers
more
fervently
besieged
than
in
dublin
youthful
squireens
who
boasted
of
being
admirable
snipe
shots
and
possessed
a
knowledge
of
all
that
pertained
to
horses
struggled
with
prim
youths
out
of
banks
for
the
privilege
of
serving
as
troopers
the
sons
of
plump
graziers
in
the
west
made
up
parties
with
footmen
out
of
their
mansions
and
arrived
in
dublin
hopeful
of
enlistment
undergraduates
of
trinity
assistants
of
dubious
character
and
the
crowd
of
nondescripts
whose
time
is
spent
in
preparing
for
examinations
which
they
fail
to
pass
leaped
at
the
opportunity
of
winning
glory
and
perhaps
wealth
in
south
africa
those
who
were
fortunate
enough
to
be
selected
were
sent
to
the
curragh
to
be
broken
in
to
their
new
profession
they
were
clothed
to
their
own
intense
delight
in
that
peculiar
shade
of
yellow
which
is
supposed
to
be
a
help
to
the
soldier
in
his
efforts
not
to
be
shot
their
legs
were
screwed
into
putties
and
breeches
incredibly
tight
round
the
knees
which
expanded
rapidly
higher
up
and
hung
round
their
hips
in
voluminous
folds
their
jackets
were
covered
with
a
multiplicity
of
quaint
little
pockets
sewed
on
in
unexpected
places
and
each
provided
with
a
flap
which
buttoned
over
it
the
name
of
the
artist
who
designed
this
costume
has
perished
nor
does
there
remain
any
written
record
of
the
use
which
these
were
supposed
to
serve
augusta
goold
suggested
that
perhaps
they
were
meant
to
prevent
the
money
from
falling
out
in
the
event
of
any
commanding
officer
ordering
his
men
to
receive
the
enemy
standing
on
their
heads
the
light
of
the
intelligence
displayed
by
the
english
generals
up
to
the
present
she
said
war
office
is
quite
right
to
be
prepared
for
such
a
thing
it
seemed
possible
to
procure
almost
any
amount
of
leave
from
the
curragh
and
the
yeomen
delighted
to
spend
it
in
promenading
the
fashionable
streets
of
the
metropolis
the
reaped
a
rich
harvest
from
the
regal
way
in
which
they
treated
their
female
relatives
and
friends
indeed
their
presence
must
have
seriously
disorganized
the
occupations
by
which
young
women
earn
their
living
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
that
the
sick
in
the
hospitals
could
have
been
properly
looked
after
or
the
letters
of
solicitors
typewritten
so
great
was
the
number
of
damsels
who
attached
themselves
to
these
attractive
heroes
the
philosophic
observer
found
another
curious
subject
for
speculation
in
the
fact
that
this
parade
of
military
splendour
took
place
in
a
city
whose
population
sympathized
intensely
with
the
boer
cause
and
was
accustomed
to
receive
the
news
of
a
british
defeat
with
delight
the
dublin
artisan
viewed
the
yeomen
much
as
the
french
in
paris
must
have
looked
upon
the
allied
troops
who
entered
their
city
after
waterloo
the
very
name
by
which
they
were
called
had
an
sound
and
suggested
the
performance
of
other
amateur
in
wexford
a
century
earlier
the
little
band
whose
writings
filled
the
pages
of
the
were
more
than
anyone
else
enraged
at
the
flaunting
of
imperialism
in
their
streets
they
had
rejoiced
quite
openly
after
christmas
and
called
attention
every
week
in
prose
and
poetry
to
the
moribund
condition
of
the
british
empire
even
boasting
as
if
they
themselves
had
borne
a
part
in
its
humiliation
they
were
still
in
a
position
to
assert
that
the
boers
were
victorious
and
that
the
volunteers
were
likely
to
do
no
more
than
exhaust
the
prison
accommodation
at
pretoria
they
could
and
did
compose
biting
jests
but
their
very
bitterness
witnessed
to
a
deep
disappointment
it
was
not
possible
to
deny
that
the
despised
english
garrison
in
ireland
was
displaying
a
wholly
spirit
no
one
could
have
expected
that
west
britons
and
would
have
wanted
to
fight
very
likely
when
the
time
came
they
would
run
away
but
in
the
meanwhile
here
they
were
swaggering
through
the
streets
of
dublin
outward
and
visible
signs
of
a
force
in
the
country
hostile
to
the
hopes
of
the
a
force
that
some
day
republican
ireland
would
have
to
reckon
with
augusta
goold
herself
was
more
tolerant
and
more
philosophic
than
her
friends
she
looked
at
the
yeomen
with
a
certain
admiration
their
exuberant
youthfulness
their
strutting
and
their
obvious
belief
in
themselves
made
a
strong
appeal
to
her
imagination
at
that
young
man
she
said
to
hyacinth
pointing
out
a
volunteer
who
passed
them
in
the
street
happen
to
know
who
he
is
in
fact
i
knew
his
people
very
well
indeed
at
one
time
and
spent
a
fortnight
with
them
once
when
that
young
man
was
a
toddler
and
sometimes
sat
on
my
knee
at
least
he
may
have
sat
on
my
knee
there
were
a
good
many
children
and
at
this
distance
of
time
i
be
certain
which
of
them
it
was
that
used
to
worry
me
most
during
the
hour
before
dinner
the
father
is
a
landlord
in
the
north
and
comes
of
a
fine
old
family
a
strong
protestant
and
english
of
course
in
all
his
sympathies
well
a
hundred
years
or
so
ago
that
was
swaggering
about
these
same
streets
in
a
uniform
just
as
his
descendant
is
doing
now
he
helped
to
drag
a
cannon
into
the
phoenix
park
one
day
with
a
large
placard
tied
over
its
muzzle
rights
or
who
do
you
think
he
was
threatening
just
the
same
england
that
this
boy
is
so
keen
to
fight
for
said
hyacinth
are
thinking
of
the
volunteer
movement
of
she
went
on
was
one
of
the
incorruptibles
see
his
name
on
jonah
red
list
he
stood
out
to
the
last
against
the
union
be
bribed
and
fought
two
duels
with
bravoes
the
curious
thing
is
that
the
present
man
is
quite
proud
of
that
ancestor
in
a
queer
inconsistent
sort
of
way
says
the
only
mark
of
distinction
his
family
can
boast
of
is
that
they
get
a
union
peerage
strange
it
is
strange
said
hyacinth
irish
gentry
of
were
men
to
be
proud
of
yet
look
at
their
descendants
is
very
sad
do
you
know
i
sometimes
think
that
ireland
will
never
get
her
freedom
till
those
men
take
it
for
her
almost
every
struggle
that
ireland
ever
made
was
captained
by
her
aristocracy
think
of
the
geraldines
and
the
think
of
sarsfield
and
the
wild
geese
think
of
the
men
who
wrenched
a
measure
of
independence
from
england
in
think
of
lord
edward
and
smith
no
we
may
talk
and
write
and
agitate
but
nothing
till
we
get
the
old
families
with
hyacinth
laughed
it
seemed
to
him
that
miss
goold
was
deliberately
talking
nonsense
rejoicing
in
a
paradox
are
likely
to
wait
if
we
wait
for
them
look
at
he
waved
his
hand
towards
a
group
of
yeomen
who
were
chatting
at
the
street
corner
are
going
to
stamp
out
a
nation
in
south
africa
is
it
likely
that
they
will
create
one
here
is
not
she
sighed
as
she
spoke
stranger
things
than
that
have
happened
have
you
ever
considered
what
the
present
english
policy
in
ireland
really
is
do
you
understand
that
they
are
trying
to
keep
us
quiet
by
bribing
the
priests
they
think
that
the
protestants
are
powerless
or
that
they
will
be
loyal
no
matter
what
happens
but
think
these
protestants
have
been
accustomed
for
generations
to
regard
themselves
as
a
superior
race
they
conceive
themselves
to
have
a
natural
right
to
govern
now
they
are
being
snubbed
and
insulted
there
an
english
official
from
their
lord
lieutenant
down
but
thinks
he
is
quite
safe
in
ignoring
the
protestants
and
is
only
anxious
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
the
priests
the
beginning
very
soon
be
bullied
as
well
as
snubbed
they
will
stand
a
good
deal
of
it
because
like
most
strong
people
they
are
very
stupid
and
slow
at
understanding
but
do
you
suppose
they
will
always
stand
it
english
and
not
irish
said
hyacinth
suppose
they
like
what
their
own
people
a
lie
they
are
not
english
though
they
say
it
themselves
in
the
end
they
will
find
out
that
they
are
irish
some
day
a
last
insult
a
particularly
barefaced
robbery
or
an
intolerable
oppression
will
awake
them
then
turn
on
the
people
that
betrayed
them
they
will
discover
that
ireland
their
ireland
meant
to
be
a
for
manchester
nor
yet
a
for
sucking
priests
ah
it
will
be
good
to
be
alive
when
they
find
themselves
we
shall
be
within
reach
of
the
freedom
of
ireland
hyacinth
was
amazed
at
her
vehement
admiration
for
the
class
she
was
accustomed
to
anathematize
he
turned
her
words
over
and
over
in
his
mind
they
recalled
as
so
many
different
things
seemed
to
do
his
vision
of
an
armageddon
amid
the
confusion
of
irish
politics
this
thought
of
a
protestant
and
aristocratic
revolt
was
strangely
attractive
only
it
seemed
to
be
wholly
impossible
he
bewildered
himself
in
the
effort
to
arrange
the
pieces
of
the
game
into
some
reasonable
order
what
was
to
be
thought
of
a
priesthood
who
contrary
to
all
the
traditions
of
their
church
had
nursed
a
revolution
against
the
rights
of
property
or
of
a
people
amazingly
quick
of
apprehension
idealistic
of
temperament
who
time
after
time
submitted
themselves
blindfold
to
the
tyranny
of
a
single
leader
worshipped
a
man
and
asked
no
questions
about
his
policy
how
was
he
to
place
an
aristocracy
who
refused
to
lead
and
persisted
in
whining
about
their
wrongs
to
the
inattentive
shopkeepers
of
english
towns
gentlemen
not
wanting
in
honour
and
spirit
courting
a
contemptuous
bourgeoisie
with
ridiculous
flatteries
in
what
reasonable
scheme
of
things
was
it
possible
to
place
protestants
blatant
in
their
boasts
about
liberty
who
hugged
subjection
to
a
power
which
deliberately
fostered
the
growth
of
an
ecclesiastical
tyranny
where
amid
this
crazy
dance
of
fanatics
and
fools
was
a
sane
man
to
find
a
place
on
which
to
stand
how
above
all
was
ireland
a
nation
to
evolve
itself
he
turned
with
relief
from
these
perplexities
to
the
work
that
lay
before
him
however
a
man
might
worry
and
befog
himself
over
the
confused
issues
of
politics
it
was
at
all
events
a
straightforward
and
simple
matter
to
fight
and
hyacinth
was
going
to
the
front
as
the
eleventh
irish
volunteer
to
do
miss
goold
justice
she
had
been
extremely
unwilling
to
enrol
him
and
had
refused
to
take
a
penny
of
his
money
her
conscience
such
as
it
was
after
years
of
patriotic
endeavour
rebelled
against
committing
a
young
man
whom
she
really
liked
to
the
companionship
of
the
men
she
had
enlisted
and
the
care
of
their
commander
captain
albert
quinn
this
gentleman
whom
she
daily
expected
in
dublin
belonged
to
county
mayo
he
represented
himself
as
a
member
of
an
ancient
but
impoverished
family
boasted
of
his
military
experience
and
professed
to
be
profoundly
skilled
in
all
matters
relating
to
horses
miss
inquiries
elicited
the
fact
that
he
held
an
undefined
position
under
his
brother
a
respectable
manufacturer
of
woollen
goods
his
military
experience
had
been
gathered
during
the
few
months
he
held
a
commission
in
the
militia
battalion
of
the
connaught
rangers
an
honourable
position
which
he
had
resigned
because
his
brother
officers
persistently
misunderstood
his
methods
of
winning
money
at
cards
no
one
however
was
found
to
deny
that
he
really
did
possess
a
wonderful
knowledge
of
horses
the
worst
that
miss
correspondents
could
suggest
with
regard
to
this
third
qualification
was
that
he
knew
too
much
none
of
these
drawbacks
to
the
captain
he
had
assumed
the
title
when
he
accepted
the
command
of
the
volunteers
weighed
with
miss
goold
indeed
she
admitted
to
mary
in
a
moment
of
frankness
that
if
her
men
more
or
less
blackguards
she
expect
them
to
go
out
to
south
africa
she
did
not
speak
equally
plainly
to
hyacinth
she
recollected
that
he
had
displayed
a
very
inconvenient
kind
of
morality
when
she
first
knew
him
and
she
believed
him
quite
capable
of
breaking
away
from
her
influence
altogether
if
he
discovered
the
kind
of
men
she
was
willing
to
work
with
she
did
her
best
to
persuade
him
to
give
up
the
idea
of
joining
the
force
by
pointing
out
to
him
that
he
was
quite
unfitted
for
the
work
that
would
have
to
be
done
know
nothing
about
horses
she
said
suppose
ever
been
on
the
back
of
hyacinth
admitted
that
this
was
true
the
inhabitants
of
carrowkeel
rarely
ride
their
shaggy
ponies
and
when
they
do
it
is
sitting
sideways
just
above
the
tails
with
two
creels
for
turf
or
seaweed
in
the
place
where
the
saddle
ought
to
be
i
suppose
you
know
much
about
shooting
hyacinth
was
depressed
for
he
had
never
pulled
a
trigger
in
his
life
in
the
west
of
ireland
a
man
is
not
allowed
to
possess
a
gun
unless
a
resident
magistrate
will
certify
to
his
loyalty
and
harmlessness
therefore
the
inhabitants
of
villages
like
carrowkeel
are
debarred
from
shooting
either
snipe
or
seals
and
the
british
empire
stands
secure
the
difficulty
about
his
horsemanship
hyacinth
endeavoured
to
get
over
he
arranged
with
a
of
his
acquaintance
to
teach
him
to
groom
and
harness
his
horses
the
man
possessed
two
quadrupeds
which
he
described
as
yellow
and
little
hyacinth
began
with
the
yellow
pony
the
oldest
and
staidest
of
the
two
the
little
mare
who
had
a
temper
of
her
own
gave
him
more
trouble
she
disliked
his
way
of
putting
the
crupper
under
her
tail
and
one
day
to
her
great
delight
the
divil
on
when
her
new
groom
got
the
shaft
of
the
car
stuck
through
her
collar
the
want
of
experience
in
shooting
was
more
difficult
to
get
over
grealy
owned
an
antiquated
army
rifle
which
he
lent
to
hyacinth
it
was
of
course
entirely
different
from
the
mauser
and
it
was
impossible
to
get
an
opportunity
for
firing
it
off
however
there
was
some
comfort
to
be
found
in
handling
the
thing
and
taking
long
and
careful
aim
at
a
distant
church
spire
through
a
window
in
the
face
of
such
enthusiasm
miss
goold
could
not
refuse
her
recruit
she
talked
to
him
freely
about
her
plans
and
was
eloquent
about
the
spirit
and
abilities
of
de
villeneuve
who
was
to
take
charge
of
her
soldiers
after
they
joined
him
in
paris
on
the
subject
of
captain
quinn
she
was
much
more
reticent
and
she
refused
altogether
to
introduce
hyacinth
to
his
ten
fellow
troopers
not
the
least
necessity
she
said
you
to
meet
them
until
the
time
for
starting
comes
in
fact
i
may
say
it
is
safer
for
none
of
you
to
know
each
hyacinth
experienced
a
thrill
of
agreeable
excitement
he
felt
that
he
was
engaged
in
a
real
conspiracy
fear
of
informers
he
asked
one
never
can
be
quite
sure
of
anyone
of
course
they
can
every
one
of
them
give
information
against
me
you
can
yourself
if
you
like
but
no
one
can
betray
anyone
else
and
as
long
as
the
men
are
safe
it
matter
what
happens
to
it
was
one
of
miss
weaknesses
that
she
imagined
herself
to
be
an
object
of
hatred
and
dread
to
the
government
and
nothing
irritated
her
more
than
a
suspicion
that
she
was
not
being
taken
seriously
the
first
glimpse
that
hyacinth
got
of
the
character
of
the
men
among
whom
he
was
to
serve
came
to
him
through
tim
halloran
tim
was
still
sore
from
the
scolding
he
had
been
given
for
his
conduct
at
the
rotunda
meeting
and
missed
no
opportunity
of
scoffing
not
of
course
publicly
but
among
his
friends
at
miss
goold
and
her
volunteers
hyacinth
avoided
him
as
much
as
possible
but
one
evening
he
walked
up
against
him
on
the
narrow
footway
at
the
corner
of
street
halloran
was
delighted
and
seized
him
by
the
arm
the
very
man
i
wanted
to
see
he
said
you
heard
about
doherty
hyacinth
knew
no
one
called
doherty
he
said
so
and
tried
to
escape
but
halloran
held
him
fast
know
doherty
that
i
thought
you
were
in
all
dear
secrets
faith
i
heard
you
were
going
out
to
fight
for
the
boers
yourself
i
believe
it
of
course
you
be
such
a
fool
but
i
thought
know
that
doherty
is
one
of
the
ten
precious
recruits
or
rather
one
of
he
laughed
loudly
fight
on
the
other
side
now
if
he
fights
at
do
you
mean
asked
hyacinth
uneasily
he
was
not
at
all
sure
what
view
the
authorities
in
dublin
castle
might
take
of
recruiting
for
the
boer
service
and
miss
hints
about
informers
recurred
to
his
mind
alarmingly
perhaps
this
doherty
was
an
informer
said
halloran
was
in
one
of
the
this
morning
doing
my
work
for
the
you
know
i
report
the
police
news
for
that
rag
you
well
i
do
my
column
is
called
doom
of
the
rather
a
good
title
that
for
a
column
of
the
kind
there
appear
to
be
anything
particular
on
just
a
few
ordinary
drunks
until
this
fellow
doherty
was
brought
in
i
thought
i
recognised
him
and
when
i
heard
his
name
i
was
certain
of
my
man
he
done
anything
very
bad
assaulted
a
or
some
such
trifle
and
would
have
got
off
with
a
fine
however
a
military
man
turned
up
and
claimed
him
as
a
deserter
his
real
name
it
appears
is
johnston
he
deserted
six
weeks
ago
from
the
dublin
on
earth
did
he
impose
on
miss
goold
asked
hyacinth
halloran
looked
at
him
curiously
i
say
he
exactly
imposed
upon
finola
not
precisely
a
fool
you
know
and
she
has
pretty
accurate
information
about
most
of
the
people
she
deals
surely
halloran
shrugged
his
shoulders
dear
fellow
i
want
to
shatter
your
ideal
but
the
beautiful
finola
wants
to
work
a
revolution
and
you
do
that
sort
of
thing
without
soiling
your
hands
however
whether
he
imposed
on
her
or
not
no
doubt
about
it
that
he
was
a
deserter
why
it
appeared
that
the
fool
was
tattooed
all
over
the
arms
and
chest
and
the
military
people
had
a
list
of
the
designs
they
had
a
perfectly
plain
case
and
indeed
doherty
made
no
will
they
do
with
him
said
hyacinth
still
uneasy
about
the
possibility
of
volunteering
information
know
said
halloran
should
think
the
best
punishment
would
be
to
send
him
out
to
ladysmith
i
dare
say
the
boers
would
pass
him
in
if
the
circumstances
were
explained
to
them
by
the
way
it
would
be
rather
funny
if
he
met
the
other
nine
out
there
on
a
kopje
it
he
might
take
them
prisoners
or
they
might
capture
him
either
way
the
situation
would
have
its
comic
chapter
xi
miss
goold
lived
that
part
of
her
life
which
was
not
spent
at
political
meetings
or
in
the
office
of
the
in
a
villa
at
killiney
a
house
agent
would
have
described
it
as
a
most
desirable
residence
standing
in
its
own
grounds
overlooking
the
sea
its
windows
opened
upon
one
of
the
best
of
the
many
beautiful
views
of
dublin
bay
its
of
pleasure
ground
attended
to
by
a
jobbing
gardener
once
a
week
was
trim
and
flowery
its
brown
gate
shone
with
frequently
renewed
paint
and
the
drive
up
to
the
door
was
neatly
raked
inside
miss
wants
were
ministered
to
by
an
eminently
respectable
his
wife
who
cooked
and
a
maid
the
married
couple
were
fixtures
and
had
been
with
miss
goold
since
she
started
housekeeping
the
maids
varied
they
never
quarrelled
with
their
mistress
but
they
found
it
impossible
to
live
with
their
and
ginty
were
north
of
ireland
protestants
of
the
severest
type
ginty
himself
was
a
strong
orangeman
and
his
wife
professed
and
enforced
a
strict
code
of
morals
it
did
not
in
the
least
vex
miss
goold
to
know
that
her
quarters
were
decorated
with
portraits
of
the
reigning
family
in
gilt
frames
or
that
king
william
iii
pranced
on
a
white
charger
above
the
kitchen
range
nor
had
she
any
objection
to
her
butler
invoking
a
nightly
malediction
on
the
pope
over
his
tumbler
of
unfortunately
her
maids
the
first
three
were
roman
catholics
found
that
their
religious
convictions
were
outraged
and
left
after
stormy
scenes
the
protestant
from
the
north
who
followed
them
was
indifferent
to
the
eternal
destiny
of
leo
but
declined
to
be
dictated
to
by
ginty
about
the
conduct
of
her
love
affairs
miss
goold
to
whom
the
quarrel
was
referred
pleaded
the
cause
and
suggested
privately
that
not
even
a
policeman
she
had
a
low
opinion
of
the
force
could
be
swept
away
from
the
path
of
respectability
by
a
passion
for
so
ugly
a
girl
ginty
pointed
out
in
reply
that
red
hair
and
freckles
were
no
safeguard
when
a
flirtation
is
carried
on
after
dark
there
seemed
no
answer
to
this
and
the
maid
returned
indignantly
to
ballymena
she
was
succeeded
by
an
anaemic
and
wholly
incompetent
niece
of
who
lived
in
such
terror
of
her
aunt
that
peace
settled
upon
the
household
miss
goold
suspected
that
this
girl
did
little
or
no
work
was
in
fact
wholly
unfit
for
her
position
but
so
long
as
she
herself
was
made
comfortable
it
did
not
seem
to
matter
who
tidied
away
her
clothes
or
dusted
her
bedroom
miss
goold
in
fact
had
so
far
mastered
the
philosophy
of
life
as
to
understand
that
the
only
real
use
of
money
is
to
purchase
comfort
and
freedom
from
minor
worries
she
had
deliberately
cut
herself
adrift
from
the
social
set
to
which
she
belonged
by
birth
and
education
and
so
had
little
temptation
to
spend
her
substance
either
in
giving
parties
or
enjoying
them
the
ladies
who
flutter
round
the
lord
hospitable
court
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
calling
on
a
danseuse
as
on
miss
goold
their
husbands
brothers
and
sons
took
liberties
with
her
reputation
in
the
of
the
kildare
street
club
and
professed
to
be
in
possession
of
private
information
about
her
life
which
placed
her
outside
the
charity
of
even
their
tolerant
morality
the
little
circle
of
revolutionary
politicians
who
gathered
round
the
were
not
the
sort
of
people
who
gave
and
there
is
in
spite
of
the
gospel
precept
a
certain
awkwardness
nowadays
in
continually
asking
people
to
dinner
who
can
not
afford
a
retributive
invitation
occasionally
however
miss
goold
did
entertain
a
few
of
her
friends
and
it
was
generally
admitted
among
them
that
she
not
only
provided
food
and
drink
of
great
excellence
but
arranged
the
appointments
of
her
feasts
luxuriously
on
the
very
day
after
his
interview
with
tim
halloran
hyacinth
received
an
invitation
to
dinner
at
the
killiney
villa
captain
quinn
the
note
informed
him
had
arrived
in
dublin
and
was
anxious
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
his
future
it
seemed
to
hyacinth
thinking
over
the
story
of
doherty
unlikely
that
the
whole
corps
would
be
asked
to
meet
their
captain
round
a
but
he
hoped
that
some
of
them
would
be
there
their
presence
would
reconcile
him
to
the
awkwardness
of
not
possessing
a
grealy
who
had
occasionally
dined
at
the
villa
warned
him
that
a
white
and
black
trousers
would
certainly
be
expected
of
him
and
hyacinth
made
an
unsuccessful
effort
to
hire
garments
for
the
night
which
would
fit
him
in
the
end
since
it
seemed
absurd
to
purchase
even
a
suit
for
a
single
evening
he
brushed
his
sunday
clothes
and
bought
a
pair
of
shoes
he
arrived
at
the
platform
of
westland
row
station
in
good
time
for
the
train
he
meant
to
catch
he
was
soon
joined
by
miss
who
appeared
with
her
head
and
neck
swathed
in
a
fluffy
shawl
and
the
train
of
a
silk
skirt
gathered
in
her
hand
the
view
of
several
flounces
of
nebulous
white
petticoat
confirmed
hyacinth
in
his
conjecture
that
she
was
bound
for
miss
party
no
one
who
could
be
supposed
to
be
a
member
of
captain
corps
appeared
on
the
platform
and
hyacinth
became
painfully
conscious
of
the
shortcomings
of
his
costume
he
thought
that
even
miss
glanced
at
it
with
some
contempt
he
wished
that
failing
a
he
could
have
imitated
the
imperial
yeomen
who
paraded
the
streets
and
donned
some
kind
of
uniform
his
discomfort
reached
a
climax
when
ginty
received
them
at
the
door
passed
miss
on
to
the
incompetent
niece
and
solemnly
extracted
the
new
shoes
from
their
parcel
miss
goold
stood
chatting
to
captain
quinn
when
hyacinth
entered
the
she
moved
forward
to
meet
him
radiant
and
splendid
he
thought
beyond
imagination
the
rustle
of
her
draperies
the
faint
scent
that
hung
around
her
and
the
glitter
of
the
stones
on
her
throat
bewildered
him
it
was
not
till
after
he
had
been
presented
to
his
commander
that
he
was
able
to
take
his
eyes
off
her
then
in
spite
of
his
embarrassment
he
experienced
surprise
and
disappointment
he
had
formed
no
clear
idea
of
what
he
expected
captain
quinn
to
be
like
but
he
had
a
vague
mental
picture
of
a
swashbuckler
a
man
of
immense
power
and
hirsute
hands
instead
there
stood
before
him
a
slim
small
man
clean
shaved
with
shiny
black
hair
smoothly
brushed
his
clothes
were
so
well
cut
and
his
linen
so
glossy
that
he
seemed
fittingly
placed
even
beside
the
magnificent
finola
his
hand
when
hyacinth
shook
it
seemed
absurdly
small
and
his
feet
in
their
neat
pumps
were
more
like
a
than
a
then
when
he
turned
to
resume
his
conversation
with
his
hostess
hyacinth
was
able
to
watch
his
face
he
noticed
the
eyes
they
were
small
and
quick
like
a
and
shifted
rapidly
never
resting
long
on
any
object
his
mouth
was
seldom
closed
and
the
lips
like
the
eyes
moved
incessantly
though
very
slightly
there
were
strange
lines
about
the
cheeks
and
jaws
which
somehow
suggested
that
the
man
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
the
evil
of
the
world
and
not
altogether
unwillingly
his
voice
was
wonderfully
soft
and
clear
and
he
spoke
without
a
trace
of
any
provincial
accent
during
dinner
captain
quinn
took
the
largest
share
in
the
conversation
it
appeared
that
he
was
a
man
of
considerable
knowledge
of
the
world
he
had
been
a
sailor
in
his
time
and
had
made
two
voyages
to
melbourne
as
apprentice
in
a
large
his
stories
were
interesting
and
humorously
told
though
they
all
dealt
with
experiences
of
his
own
he
never
allowed
himself
to
figure
as
anything
of
a
hero
he
recounted
for
instance
how
one
night
in
melbourne
docks
he
had
run
from
a
swede
armed
with
a
knife
and
had
spent
hours
dodging
round
the
deck
of
a
ship
and
calling
for
help
before
he
could
get
his
assailant
arrested
his
career
as
an
officer
in
the
mercantile
navy
was
cut
short
by
a
period
of
imprisonment
in
a
small
town
in
madagascar
he
did
not
specify
his
offence
but
gave
a
vivid
account
of
life
in
the
gaol
were
twenty
of
us
altogether
he
said
niggers
and
myself
there
was
no
nonsense
about
discipline
or
work
we
just
sat
about
all
day
in
an
open
courtyard
with
nothing
but
a
big
iron
gate
between
us
and
liberty
all
the
same
there
was
very
little
chance
of
escape
there
were
always
four
black
soldiers
on
guard
truculent
scoundrels
with
curly
swords
a
sort
of
missionary
man
got
wind
of
my
being
there
and
used
to
come
and
visit
me
one
day
he
gave
me
a
tract
called
i
read
the
thing
because
i
had
absolutely
nothing
else
to
read
in
the
end
it
turned
out
an
extremely
useful
tract
for
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
old
plan
for
defeating
the
midianites
might
work
with
the
four
black
soldiers
i
organized
the
other
prisoners
and
divided
them
into
three
bands
we
raked
up
a
pretty
fair
substitute
for
pitchers
and
lamps
then
one
night
we
played
off
the
stratagem
and
flurried
the
sentries
to
such
an
extent
that
i
got
clear
away
i
rather
fancy
one
or
two
others
got
off
too
but
i
know
i
got
into
a
rather
disagreeable
tramp
steamer
and
volunteered
as
stoker
so
difficult
to
get
stokers
in
the
tropics
that
the
captain
took
his
risks
and
kept
me
i
must
say
i
was
sorry
afterwards
that
i
stayed
in
the
the
story
was
properly
appreciated
by
the
audience
and
hyacinth
began
to
feel
a
liking
for
the
captain
you
know
said
miss
goold
when
their
laughter
had
subsided
believe
i
know
that
identical
tract
i
once
had
an
evangelical
aunt
a
dear
old
lady
who
went
about
her
house
with
a
bunch
of
keys
in
a
small
basket
she
used
to
give
me
religious
literature
i
never
was
reduced
to
reading
it
but
i
distinctly
remember
a
picture
of
gideon
with
his
mouth
open
waving
a
torch
on
the
front
page
could
it
have
been
the
same
must
have
been
said
the
captain
had
that
picture
too
gideon
had
nothing
on
but
a
sort
of
nightshirt
with
a
belt
to
it
and
only
one
sleeve
by
the
way
if
you
are
up
in
tracts
perhaps
you
know
one
called
rock
of
horeb
miss
goold
shook
her
head
well
said
the
captain
after
appealing
to
mary
and
hyacinth
be
helped
but
i
must
say
i
should
like
to
meet
someone
who
had
read
rock
of
i
once
sailed
from
peru
in
an
exceedingly
little
barque
loaded
with
guano
we
had
a
very
dull
time
going
through
the
tropics
and
absolutely
the
only
thing
to
read
on
board
was
the
first
half
of
rock
of
there
were
at
least
two
pages
missing
i
read
it
until
i
nearly
knew
it
off
by
heart
and
ever
since
been
trying
to
get
a
complete
copy
to
see
how
it
some
of
his
stories
dealt
with
more
civilized
life
he
delighted
miss
goold
with
an
account
not
at
all
unfriendly
of
the
humours
of
the
third
battalion
of
the
connaught
rangers
he
quoted
one
of
mary
poems
to
her
and
pleased
hyacinth
by
his
enthusiastic
admiration
of
the
connemara
scenery
good
food
good
wine
and
a
companion
like
captain
quinn
gladden
the
heart
and
the
little
party
was
very
merry
when
ginty
deposited
coffee
and
cigarettes
and
finally
departed
in
miss
house
it
was
not
the
custom
for
the
ladies
to
desert
the
by
themselves
very
often
the
hostess
was
the
only
lady
present
and
she
had
the
greatest
dislike
to
leaving
a
conversation
just
when
it
was
likely
to
become
really
interesting
moreover
miss
goold
smoked
not
because
it
was
a
smart
or
emancipated
thing
to
do
but
because
she
liked
it
and
a
curious
note
of
femininity
about
her
she
objected
to
her
smelling
of
tobacco
when
ginty
had
disappeared
and
the
serious
business
of
enjoying
the
food
was
completed
the
talk
of
the
party
turned
on
the
south
african
campaign
and
the
prospects
of
the
irish
volunteers
captain
quinn
displayed
a
considerable
knowledge
of
the
operations
both
of
the
boers
and
the
british
generals
for
the
latter
he
expressed
what
appeared
to
hyacinth
to
be
an
exaggerated
contempt
but
the
two
ladies
listened
to
it
with
evident
enjoyment
he
delighted
miss
goold
by
his
extreme
eagerness
to
be
off
see
he
said
we
start
afraid
out
of
the
question
said
augusta
goold
de
villeneuve
arranged
to
send
me
a
wire
when
he
was
ready
for
our
men
and
i
well
send
them
said
the
captain
it
seems
to
me
the
frenchman
is
inclined
to
dawdle
you
think
that
if
we
went
over
it
might
hurry
him
up
a
bit
she
agreed
that
this
was
possible
but
represented
the
difficulty
of
keeping
the
men
suitably
employed
in
paris
for
perhaps
three
weeks
or
a
month
see
she
said
are
all
right
here
in
dublin
where
i
can
keep
an
eye
on
them
besides
they
have
all
got
some
sort
of
employment
here
and
i
have
to
pay
them
i
got
money
enough
to
keep
them
in
paris
and
they
get
anything
from
leyds
until
you
have
them
on
board
the
captain
quinn
seemed
satisfied
but
later
on
in
the
evening
he
returned
to
the
subject
help
feeling
that
it
would
be
better
for
me
at
all
events
to
go
over
to
paris
at
once
i
ask
to
draw
any
pay
at
present
i
have
enough
by
me
to
keep
me
going
for
a
few
what
about
the
men
will
you
come
back
for
them
i
think
that
would
be
foolish
and
unnecessary
there
is
no
use
in
attracting
attention
to
our
movements
we
have
a
public
with
cheers
and
that
sort
of
thing
in
any
case
or
march
through
the
streets
like
those
ridiculous
yeomen
our
fellows
have
got
to
slip
away
quietly
in
twos
and
threes
we
tell
whether
not
being
watched
this
there
was
a
note
of
sincerity
in
the
voice
which
convinced
hyacinth
that
he
was
genuinely
frightened
at
the
thought
of
having
a
policeman
on
his
track
miss
goold
too
looked
appropriately
solemn
at
the
suggestion
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
authorities
in
dublin
castle
did
occasionally
send
a
detective
in
plain
clothes
to
walk
after
her
it
is
not
conceivable
that
they
suspected
her
of
wanting
to
blow
up
pillar
or
assassinate
a
judge
probably
they
merely
wished
to
exercise
the
members
of
the
force
and
in
the
absence
of
any
actual
crime
in
the
country
felt
that
no
harm
could
come
to
anyone
through
the
of
miss
goold
the
plan
though
the
authorities
probably
did
not
consider
this
had
the
incidental
advantage
of
gratifying
the
lady
herself
she
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
most
of
the
officers
who
were
put
on
her
track
and
was
always
in
good
spirits
when
she
recognised
one
of
them
waiting
for
her
in
westland
row
station
captain
quinn
kept
a
watch
on
her
face
with
his
sharp
shifting
eyes
while
he
spoke
and
he
was
quick
to
realize
that
he
had
hit
on
a
way
of
flattering
her
are
a
person
miss
goold
of
whose
actions
the
government
is
bound
to
take
cognisance
i
dare
say
they
have
their
suspicions
of
me
and
if
you
and
i
are
seen
together
in
dublin
during
the
next
week
or
two
there
will
certainly
be
inquiries
whereas
if
i
go
over
to
paris
at
once
there
will
be
no
reason
to
watch
you
or
anybody
augusta
goold
hesitated
do
you
say
conneally
she
asked
hyacinth
was
puzzled
at
this
extreme
eagerness
to
be
off
a
suspicion
crossed
his
mind
that
the
captain
meditated
some
kind
of
treachery
he
made
what
appeared
to
him
to
be
a
brilliant
suggestion
me
go
with
captain
quinn
i
can
start
if
necessary
i
should
like
to
see
something
of
paris
and
you
know
miss
goold
plenty
of
he
thought
it
likely
that
the
captain
would
object
to
this
plan
if
he
meditated
any
kind
of
crooked
dealing
when
he
got
to
paris
though
hyacinth
failed
to
see
any
motive
for
treachery
he
would
not
want
to
be
saddled
with
a
companion
the
answer
he
received
surprised
him
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
a
friend
with
me
in
the
intervals
of
military
preparation
we
can
have
a
gay
time
not
too
gay
of
course
miss
goold
i
shall
keep
conneally
out
of
serious
mischief
when
we
have
a
little
spare
cash
we
may
as
well
enjoy
ourselves
we
want
to
carry
money
about
with
us
in
the
transvaal
we
mean
to
live
at
the
expense
of
the
english
out
augusta
goold
smiled
almost
maternally
at
hyacinth
dear
boy
she
said
seems
plenty
of
money
to
you
go
very
far
in
paris
what
is
it
let
me
see
you
said
two
hundred
pounds
and
you
want
to
buy
your
outfit
out
of
that
keep
a
little
by
you
in
case
of
said
the
captain
settled
and
if
we
are
really
to
start
we
ought
to
get
home
conneally
may
be
ready
to
start
at
a
notice
but
he
must
at
least
pack
up
his
may
we
see
you
safe
back
to
town
miss
remember
we
shall
expect
a
valedictory
ode
in
the
next
number
of
the
write
us
something
that
will
go
to
a
tune
something
with
a
swing
in
it
and
sing
it
beside
the
camp
fires
on
the
veldt
miss
he
held
out
his
hand
as
he
spoke
a
plain
he
did
not
look
in
the
least
as
if
he
thought
so
led
too
rough
a
life
to
be
any
good
at
making
pretty
speeches
but
glad
seen
you
and
talked
to
you
if
knocked
on
the
head
out
there
i
shall
go
under
satisfied
for
met
a
woman
fit
to
be
a
queen
a
woman
who
is
a
queen
the
queen
of
the
heart
of
it
is
likely
that
augusta
goold
though
she
was
certainly
not
a
fool
was
a
little
excited
by
the
homage
for
she
refused
to
say
declaring
that
she
would
see
the
boat
off
next
morning
it
was
a
promise
which
would
cost
her
something
to
keep
for
the
mail
steamer
leaves
at
and
miss
goold
was
a
lady
who
appreciated
the
warmth
of
her
bed
in
the
mornings
especially
during
the
early
days
of
march
when
the
wind
is
likely
to
be
in
the
east
chapter
xii
captain
quinn
made
himself
very
agreeable
to
mary
during
the
short
journey
back
to
dublin
at
westland
row
he
saw
her
into
a
cab
which
he
paid
for
his
last
words
were
a
reminder
that
he
would
expect
to
have
her
music
and
all
sent
after
him
to
paris
then
he
turned
to
hyacinth
all
right
done
with
her
it
was
better
to
pay
the
cab
for
her
else
she
might
have
scrupled
about
taking
one
and
we
should
have
been
obliged
to
go
home
with
her
in
a
beastly
tram
come
along
staying
at
the
gresham
always
as
well
to
go
to
a
decent
place
if
you
have
any
money
you
come
with
me
and
have
a
drink
and
a
there
were
two
priests
and
a
bishop
in
earnest
conference
round
the
fire
in
the
hall
of
the
hotel
when
they
entered
when
he
discovered
that
their
talk
was
of
the
iniquities
of
the
national
board
of
education
and
therefore
likely
to
last
beyond
midnight
captain
quinn
led
the
way
into
the
which
was
unoccupied
a
sufficient
supply
of
whisky
and
a
syphon
of
were
set
before
them
the
captain
stretched
himself
in
a
comfortable
chair
and
lit
his
pipe
fine
woman
miss
goold
he
said
meditatively
hyacinth
murmured
an
assent
very
fine
woman
and
apparently
pretty
comfortably
off
i
wonder
why
on
earth
she
does
he
looked
at
hyacinth
as
if
he
expected
some
sort
of
explanation
to
be
forthcoming
what
asked
hyacinth
at
length
all
this
revolutionary
business
the
seditious
speeches
and
now
this
rot
about
helping
the
boers
what
does
she
stand
to
gain
by
it
i
suppose
any
money
in
the
business
and
a
woman
like
that
might
get
all
the
notoriety
she
wants
in
her
own
proper
set
without
stumping
the
country
and
talking
this
way
of
looking
at
augusta
patriotism
was
new
to
hyacinth
and
he
resented
it
suppose
she
believes
in
the
principles
she
professes
he
said
the
captain
looked
at
him
curiously
and
then
took
a
drink
of
his
he
said
suppose
she
does
after
all
her
motives
are
nothing
to
us
and
a
damned
fine
woman
whatever
she
does
it
he
drank
again
would
have
been
very
pleasant
now
if
she
would
have
spent
the
next
few
weeks
with
me
in
paris
you
mind
my
saying
that
rather
have
had
her
than
you
conneally
as
a
companion
in
a
little
burst
however
i
saw
at
once
that
it
do
anyone
with
an
eye
in
his
head
could
tell
at
a
glance
that
she
that
he
sighed
hyacinth
was
not
quite
sure
that
he
understood
the
suggestion
was
so
calmly
made
and
reasoned
on
that
it
seemed
impossible
that
it
could
be
as
iniquitous
as
it
appeared
no
one
such
an
utter
fool
about
women
went
on
the
captain
your
respectable
married
man
who
never
does
anything
wrong
himself
heard
of
miss
goold
as
everybody
has
and
listened
to
discussions
about
her
character
you
know
just
as
well
as
i
do
the
sort
of
things
they
say
about
hyacinth
did
know
very
well
and
flared
up
in
defence
of
his
patroness
are
vile
just
what
saying
those
respectable
people
who
tell
the
lies
are
such
fools
they
think
that
every
woman
who
mew
about
at
afternoon
parties
must
be
a
bad
one
now
anyone
with
a
little
experience
would
know
at
once
that
miss
goold
this
the
other
one
called
her
oh
yes
finola
that
finola
may
be
a
fool
but
not
he
pulled
himself
together
as
he
spoke
evidently
he
plumed
himself
on
his
experience
and
the
faculty
for
judging
it
had
brought
him
just
as
soon
have
asked
my
to
come
to
paris
with
me
for
a
fortnight
as
finola
you
know
james
quinn
i
think
a
pity
the
most
domesticated
and
virtuous
in
the
he
paused
and
then
asked
hyacinth
are
you
doing
it
again
hyacinth
was
reduced
by
sheer
surprise
to
a
futility
what
going
out
to
fight
for
the
boers
now
like
a
good
fellow
say
acting
on
principle
all
well
enough
to
give
finola
credit
for
that
kind
of
thing
she
is
as
we
agreed
a
splendid
woman
but
you
ask
me
to
believe
in
the
whole
corps
in
the
same
hyacinth
meditated
a
reply
it
was
clearly
impossible
to
assert
that
he
wanted
to
fight
for
liberty
to
give
his
life
to
the
cause
of
an
oppressed
nationality
it
would
be
utterly
absurd
to
tell
the
story
of
his
vision
and
say
that
he
looked
on
the
south
african
war
as
a
skirmish
preliminary
to
the
armageddon
sitting
opposite
to
this
cynical
man
of
the
world
and
listening
to
his
talk
hyacinth
came
himself
to
disbelieve
in
principle
he
felt
that
there
must
be
some
baser
motive
at
the
bottom
of
his
desire
to
fight
only
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
remember
what
it
was
he
could
not
even
imagine
a
good
reason
good
in
the
estimation
of
his
companion
why
anyone
should
do
so
foolish
a
thing
as
go
out
to
the
transvaal
the
captain
was
not
at
all
impatient
he
sat
smoking
quietly
until
there
seemed
no
prospect
of
hyacinth
answering
then
he
said
if
you
want
to
tell
me
i
mind
only
i
think
foolish
you
see
little
accidents
happen
in
these
affairs
there
are
such
things
as
bullets
and
one
of
them
might
hit
you
somewhere
that
would
matter
then
it
would
be
my
duty
to
send
home
your
last
words
to
your
sorrowing
relatives
and
it
would
be
easier
to
do
that
if
i
knew
exactly
what
you
had
done
the
repentance
of
the
prodigal
is
always
most
consoling
to
the
elder
brother
much
more
consoling
in
fact
than
the
return
now
how
the
deuce
am
i
to
make
up
a
plausible
repentance
for
you
if
i
know
what
done
not
done
anything
said
hyacinth
ineffectively
the
captain
ignored
him
now
it
be
anything
very
bad
at
your
age
have
you
got
into
a
mess
with
a
girl
he
brightened
up
at
the
guess
you
hopelessly
enamoured
of
the
beautiful
finola
that
would
be
most
suitable
the
bold
bad
woman
sends
the
minstrel
boy
to
his
death
with
his
wild
harp
slung
behind
him
i
could
draw
tears
from
the
elder
brother
over
if
he
could
have
thought
of
a
crime
at
the
moment
hyacinth
would
probably
have
confessed
it
but
he
was
bewildered
and
could
hit
on
nothing
better
than
have
no
elder
brother
in
fact
no
relation
of
any
man
now
i
have
a
perfect
specimen
of
a
brother
james
quinn
esquire
of
ballymoy
a
churchwarden
think
of
that
if
it
should
be
your
melancholy
duty
to
send
the
message
home
to
him
in
case
that
bullet
hits
me
i
mean
tell
him
oh
no
false
pride
about
me
fill
your
glass
again
i
in
the
least
mind
your
knowing
that
i
go
a
step
to
fight
for
boer
or
briton
either
if
it
for
a
little
affair
connected
with
some
horses
and
a
cheque
you
see
the
war
office
people
sent
down
a
perfect
idiot
to
buy
remounts
for
the
cavalry
in
galway
and
mayo
he
was
the
sort
of
idiot
that
would
tempt
an
archbishop
to
swindle
him
i
rather
overdid
it
afraid
and
now
the
matter
is
likely
to
come
for
all
his
boasted
powers
of
observation
captain
quinn
failed
to
notice
the
disgust
and
alarm
on
face
stuck
the
fool
he
went
on
every
old
screw
in
the
country
i
got
mares
from
the
ploughs
i
collected
a
regular
hospital
of
spavined
beasts
and
he
took
them
from
me
without
a
word
at
thirty
pounds
apiece
it
would
have
been
all
right
if
i
had
gone
no
further
but
hang
it
all
i
got
to
the
end
of
my
tether
i
declare
to
you
i
believe
there
was
another
screw
left
in
the
whole
county
of
mayo
and
unless
i
took
to
selling
him
the
asses
i
go
on
then
i
heard
of
this
plan
of
your
friend
and
i
determined
to
make
a
little
coup
and
clear
i
altered
a
cheque
the
idiot
was
on
his
way
to
an
corner
of
connemara
looking
for
mounted
infantry
cobs
i
knew
he
see
his
for
at
least
a
week
so
i
chanced
it
the
reason
why
i
am
so
uncommonly
anxious
to
get
clear
at
once
if
i
once
get
off
it
will
be
next
door
to
impossible
to
get
me
back
again
general
joubert
will
hardly
give
me
up
not
the
least
afraid
of
those
ridiculous
policemen
who
walk
about
after
finola
but
i
am
very
much
afraid
of
being
tapped
on
the
shoulder
for
reasons
quite
i
can
tell
you
been
on
the
jump
ever
since
yesterday
when
i
cashed
the
cheque
and
i
feel
easy
till
left
france
behind
me
i
fancy
safe
for
the
present
the
idiot
is
sure
to
try
fifty
ways
of
getting
his
accounts
straight
before
he
lights
on
my
little
cheque
and
when
he
does
covered
my
tracks
pretty
well
my
dear
brother
the
slightest
notion
become
of
me
i
dare
say
stop
making
inquiries
as
soon
as
the
police
begin
poor
old
chap
feel
it
about
the
family
name
and
so
he
smiled
at
his
own
reflection
in
the
mirror
over
the
chimneypiece
he
was
evidently
well
satisfied
with
the
performance
he
had
narrated
then
at
last
hyacinth
found
himself
able
to
speak
again
as
when
he
had
defeated
spenser
in
the
college
his
own
coolness
surprised
him
an
infernal
blackguard
he
said
captain
quinn
looked
at
him
with
a
surprise
that
was
perfectly
genuine
he
doubted
if
he
could
have
heard
correctly
did
you
say
said
repeated
hyacinth
are
an
infernal
blackguard
you
really
suppose
that
i
would
be
going
on
this
fool
of
an
expedition
if
i
shall
tell
miss
goold
the
story
you
have
just
told
me
i
shall
tell
her
morning
before
the
boat
well
said
the
captain
suppose
for
a
moment
that
shock
finola
she
know
this
particular
story
about
me
but
i
expect
she
knows
another
every
bit
as
bad
and
i
dare
say
she
will
regard
the
whole
thing
as
a
justifiable
spoiling
of
the
egyptians
by
the
way
there
was
a
note
of
anxiety
in
his
voice
hope
you
find
it
necessary
to
repeat
anything
said
about
the
lady
herself
might
irritate
it
likely
said
hyacinth
i
would
repeat
that
kind
of
talk
to
any
woman
so
i
admire
your
attitude
such
things
are
entirely
unfit
for
repetition
but
seriously
now
what
on
earth
do
you
expect
to
happen
when
you
tell
her
perfectly
certain
that
every
single
volunteer
got
is
just
as
great
a
blackguard
your
word
my
dear
fellow
as
i
am
and
finola
knows
it
perfectly
hyacinth
hesitated
the
phrase
in
miss
letter
in
which
she
had
originally
described
her
men
as
blackguards
recurred
to
his
mind
he
remembered
the
story
of
doherty
his
anger
began
to
give
way
to
a
sick
feeling
of
disgust
now
said
the
captain
it
likely
that
you
could
enlist
a
corps
of
teachers
for
this
kind
of
work
give
you
credit
for
the
highest
motives
though
blest
if
i
understand
them
but
how
can
you
suppose
that
there
is
anyone
else
in
the
whole
world
that
feels
the
way
you
feel
or
wants
to
act
as
you
are
doing
dare
say
you
are
right
said
hyacinth
feebly
course
right
perfectly
hyacinth
tried
to
lift
his
glass
of
to
his
lips
but
his
hand
trembled
and
he
was
obliged
to
put
it
down
captain
quinn
watched
him
wipe
the
spilt
liquid
off
his
hand
and
then
settle
down
in
his
chair
with
his
head
bowed
and
his
eyes
half
shut
up
man
he
said
all
right
done
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
at
all
events
but
look
here
you
ought
not
to
come
with
us
at
all
no
job
for
a
man
like
you
you
back
out
of
it
turn
up
morning
explain
to
finola
if
there
and
if
not
write
her
a
letter
that
will
set
you
straight
with
her
really
sorry
for
you
hyacinth
looked
up
at
him
sorry
i
called
you
a
blackguard
he
said
not
any
worse
than
everyone
else
in
the
said
captain
quinn
take
it
like
that
from
your
point
of
view
you
were
quite
right
to
call
me
a
blackguard
and
mind
you
there
are
plenty
of
people
in
the
world
who
blackguards
my
brother
for
instance
a
bit
of
a
prig
in
fact
as
priggish
as
he
well
can
be
but
never
done
anything
but
run
straight
i
suppose
he
could
go
crooked
if
he
hyacinth
got
up
he
said
i
go
with
a
minute
said
captain
quinn
think
done
you
one
good
turn
in
stopping
you
going
to
south
africa
now
do
you
another
and
one
at
the
same
time
to
that
brother
of
mine
i
left
him
in
a
hurry
i
told
you
that
but
i
think
i
mentioned
that
i
was
in
his
employment
he
runs
a
woollen
factory
down
in
mayo
i
owned
a
share
in
the
business
once
but
that
went
long
ago
and
the
whole
thing
belongs
to
james
now
i
was
a
sort
of
clerk
and
general
agent
i
really
the
least
use
for
i
never
did
any
work
james
was
for
ever
complaining
but
bound
to
say
he
stuck
to
me
give
you
a
letter
to
him
and
i
dare
say
you
may
get
the
job
that
chucked
not
much
of
a
thing
but
it
may
suit
you
for
a
while
sit
down
till
i
write
my
hyacinth
obeyed
since
his
anger
evaporated
a
sort
of
numbness
had
crept
over
his
mind
he
scarcely
understood
what
was
said
to
him
he
had
a
vague
feeling
of
gratitude
towards
captain
quinn
and
at
the
same
time
a
great
desire
to
get
away
and
be
alone
he
felt
that
he
required
to
adjust
his
mind
to
the
new
thoughts
which
had
been
crowded
into
it
when
he
received
the
letter
he
put
it
into
his
pocket
and
rose
again
to
go
the
captain
saw
him
to
the
door
hyacinth
heard
him
but
his
voice
seemed
far
off
and
his
words
meaningless
my
advice
and
run
down
to
ballymoy
at
once
hang
about
finola
any
more
a
splendid
woman
but
not
for
you
if
you
married
her
be
perfectly
miserable
not
that
i
think
ever
marry
you
still
she
might
women
do
such
odd
things
if
by
any
chance
she
does
have
to
be
very
careful
give
her
her
head
and
take
her
easy
up
to
the
jumps
try
to
hustle
her
and
for
sake
begin
sawing
at
her
mouth
very
much
like
to
be
here
to
see
you
in
the
character
of
augusta
he
sighed
of
course
i
the
british
isles
will
be
too
hot
for
me
for
a
while
however
who
can
tell
what
might
happen
if
i
win
a
good
medal
from
old
kruger
and
capture
a
few
british
generals
i
might
act
best
man
for
you
yet
if
wait
a
year
or
when
hyacinth
got
home
to
his
lodgings
the
first
object
that
met
his
eye
was
ancient
rifle
he
tied
a
label
round
its
barrel
addressed
to
the
owner
then
he
packed
his
few
belongings
carefully
and
strapped
his
bag
so
far
he
was
sure
of
himself
he
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
he
must
leave
dublin
at
once
he
felt
that
he
could
not
endure
an
interview
with
augusta
goold
she
might
blame
him
or
might
pity
him
either
would
be
intolerable
she
might
even
justify
herself
to
him
might
beat
him
into
submission
by
sheer
force
of
her
beauty
and
her
passion
as
she
had
done
once
before
he
would
run
no
such
risk
he
felt
that
he
could
not
sacrifice
his
sense
of
right
and
wrong
could
not
allow
himself
to
be
dragged
into
the
moral
chaos
in
which
it
seemed
to
him
now
miss
goold
lived
he
was
unconscious
of
any
divine
leading
or
even
of
any
direct
reliance
on
the
obligations
of
honour
he
could
not
himself
have
told
why
he
clung
with
such
desperate
terror
to
his
plan
of
escaping
from
his
surroundings
simply
he
could
not
do
certain
things
or
associate
as
a
friend
with
people
who
did
them
to
get
away
from
dublin
was
the
first
necessity
for
a
moment
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
go
to
henry
tell
him
the
whole
story
and
ask
for
advice
and
help
but
that
was
impossible
how
could
he
confess
the
degradation
of
his
ideal
how
could
he
resist
the
inevitable
reminder
that
he
had
been
warned
beforehand
besides
not
even
now
after
all
that
he
had
seen
could
he
accept
point
of
view
he
still
believed
in
ireland
still
hoped
to
serve
her
still
looked
for
the
coming
of
his
captain
to
lead
the
saints
to
the
final
victory
miss
goold
had
failed
him
but
he
was
not
yet
ready
to
enrol
himself
a
citizen
of
england
no
he
must
leave
dublin
but
where
to
go
his
lamp
burnt
dim
and
expired
as
he
sat
thinking
his
fire
had
long
ago
gone
out
he
shivered
with
cold
and
misery
while
the
faint
light
of
the
dawn
stole
into
his
room
he
heard
the
first
twitter
of
the
birds
in
the
convent
garden
behind
his
lodging
then
came
the
noise
of
the
earliest
traffic
the
unnaturally
loud
rattle
of
the
on
their
rounds
a
steamer
hooted
far
away
down
the
river
and
an
early
bell
rang
the
neighbouring
nuns
to
prayer
hyacinth
grew
desperate
could
he
go
home
back
to
the
and
simple
people
of
carrowkeel
a
great
desire
for
the
old
scenes
seized
upon
him
he
fought
against
it
with
all
his
might
he
had
rejected
the
offer
of
the
home
life
once
now
no
doubt
it
would
be
closed
against
him
the
boat
that
might
have
been
his
was
sold
long
ago
he
would
not
go
back
to
confess
himself
a
fool
and
a
failure
gradually
his
mind
worked
back
over
the
conversation
in
the
hotel
with
captain
quinn
the
recollection
of
the
latter
part
of
it
which
had
meant
nothing
at
the
time
grew
clear
he
felt
for
the
letter
in
his
pocket
and
drew
it
out
after
all
why
should
he
not
offer
himself
to
james
quinn
ballymoy
was
remote
enough
to
be
a
it
was
in
county
mayo
the
captain
had
said
he
had
never
heard
of
the
place
and
it
seemed
likely
that
no
one
else
except
its
inhabitants
knew
of
it
either
at
least
there
was
no
reason
that
he
could
see
why
he
should
not
go
there
his
brain
refused
to
work
any
longer
either
at
planning
or
remembering
his
lips
formed
the
word
ballymoy
he
repeated
it
again
and
again
he
seemed
to
go
on
repeating
it
in
the
troubled
sleep
which
came
to
him
chapter
xiii
the
irish
get
credit
even
from
their
enemies
for
being
a
imaginative
and
artistic
people
yet
they
display
astonishingly
little
taste
or
originality
in
their
domestic
architecture
in
connaught
where
the
celtic
genius
may
be
supposed
to
have
the
freest
opportunity
for
expressing
itself
the
towns
are
all
exactly
alike
and
their
resemblance
consists
in
the
absence
of
any
beauty
which
can
please
the
eye
an
english
country
town
although
the
english
bucolic
is
notoriously
as
stupid
as
an
ox
has
certain
features
of
its
own
so
has
a
swiss
cottage
or
a
french
village
it
is
possible
to
represent
these
upon
christmas
cards
or
the
lids
of
without
labelling
them
english
swiss
or
french
any
moderately
well
educated
young
lady
will
recognise
them
at
once
and
exclaim
without
hesitation
truly
english
or
sweetly
swiss
but
no
one
can
depict
an
irish
town
with
any
hope
of
having
it
recognised
unless
he
idealizes
boldly
introducing
a
pig
or
a
man
in
kissing
a
colleen
and
then
after
all
he
might
as
well
have
labelled
it
irish
at
once
in
good
plain
print
and
saved
himself
the
trouble
of
drawing
the
symbolic
figures
to
describe
ballymoy
therefore
mountains
rivers
and
such
like
natural
eccentricities
being
left
out
of
the
count
is
to
describe
fifty
other
west
of
ireland
towns
there
is
a
bleak
gray
and
windswept
situated
for
the
benefit
of
local
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
town
and
the
road
which
connects
the
two
is
execrable
there
is
a
workhouse
in
ballymoy
as
everywhere
else
in
this
lost
land
the
most
prominent
building
there
is
a
convent
immense
and
wonderfully
white
with
rows
and
rows
of
staring
windows
and
a
figure
of
the
blessed
virgin
poised
in
a
niche
above
the
main
door
there
is
a
roman
catholic
church
and
unspeakably
hideous
but
large
and
like
the
workhouse
and
the
convent
obtruding
itself
upon
the
eye
it
seems
as
if
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
must
all
of
them
be
forced
and
that
at
no
distant
date
either
into
religion
or
pauperism
just
as
small
bodies
floating
in
a
pond
are
sucked
into
connection
with
one
or
other
of
the
logs
which
lie
among
them
the
shops
in
the
one
tortuous
street
block
the
footpaths
in
front
of
their
doors
with
piles
of
empty
the
passenger
is
saluted
here
by
a
buffet
in
the
face
from
a
waterproof
coat
suspended
outside
a
there
by
a
hot
breath
of
air
two
shops
out
of
every
three
are
these
occupy
a
very
beautiful
position
in
the
economic
life
of
the
town
their
profits
go
to
build
the
church
to
pay
the
priests
and
to
fill
the
coffers
of
the
nuns
the
making
of
the
profits
fills
the
workhouse
a
little
aloof
stands
the
protestant
church
austere
to
look
upon
expressing
in
all
its
lines
a
grim
reproach
of
the
life
beyond
it
among
scanty
stooped
trees
is
the
rectory
gray
as
everything
else
is
wearing
like
a
decayed
lady
the
air
of
having
lived
through
better
days
such
save
for
one
feature
is
ballymoy
as
the
traveller
sees
it
as
hyacinth
conneally
saw
it
when
he
arrived
there
one
gusty
afternoon
the
one
unusual
feature
is
james
woollen
mill
it
stands
a
gaunt
and
indeed
somewhat
dilapidated
building
at
the
bottom
of
the
street
in
the
angle
where
the
river
turns
sharply
to
flow
under
the
bridge
the
water
just
above
the
bridge
is
swept
into
a
channel
and
forced
to
turn
the
wheel
which
works
some
primitive
machinery
within
in
the
centre
of
the
front
is
an
archway
through
which
carts
pass
into
the
paved
square
behind
here
is
the
weighbridge
and
here
great
bundles
of
fleeces
are
unloaded
off
the
square
is
the
office
where
quinn
sits
pays
for
the
wool
and
enters
the
weight
of
it
in
damp
ledgers
here
on
saturdays
two
or
three
men
and
a
score
of
girls
receive
their
wages
the
business
is
a
peculiar
one
you
may
bring
your
wool
to
quinn
in
fleeces
just
as
you
sheer
it
off
the
back
he
will
pay
you
for
it
more
or
less
according
to
the
amount
of
trouble
you
have
taken
with
your
sheep
this
is
the
way
the
younger
generation
likes
to
treat
its
wool
if
you
are
older
and
are
blessed
with
a
wife
able
to
card
and
spin
you
deal
differently
with
quinn
for
many
evenings
after
the
shearing
your
wife
sits
by
the
fireside
with
two
in
her
hands
and
wipes
off
them
wonderfully
soft
rolls
of
wool
afterwards
she
fetches
the
great
wheel
from
its
nook
and
you
watch
her
pulling
out
an
endless
gray
thread
while
she
steps
back
and
forwards
across
the
floor
the
girls
watch
her
too
but
not
as
you
do
with
sleepy
admiration
their
emotion
is
amused
contempt
nevertheless
your
kitchen
wall
is
gradually
decorated
with
bunches
of
great
gray
balls
when
these
have
accumulated
sufficiently
you
take
them
to
quinn
a
certain
number
of
them
become
his
property
out
of
the
rest
he
will
weave
what
you
like
coarse
yellow
flannel
good
for
bawneens
and
when
it
is
dyed
crimson
for
petticoats
or
blankets
not
fluffy
like
the
blankets
that
are
bought
in
shops
but
warm
to
sleep
under
when
the
winter
comes
or
perhaps
frieze
very
thick
and
rough
the
one
fabric
that
will
resist
the
winter
rain
this
portion
of
his
business
quinn
finds
to
be
decreasing
year
by
year
fewer
and
fewer
women
care
to
card
and
spin
the
wool
the
younger
men
find
it
more
profitable
to
sell
it
at
once
and
to
wear
instead
of
the
old
bawneens
shirts
called
flannel
which
are
brought
over
from
lancashire
and
sold
in
the
shops
the
younger
women
think
that
they
look
prettier
in
gowns
made
artfully
by
the
local
dressmaker
out
of
feeble
materials
got
up
to
catch
the
eye
if
now
and
then
for
the
sake
of
real
warmth
one
of
them
makes
a
petticoat
of
the
old
crimson
flannel
it
is
kept
so
short
that
save
in
very
heavy
rain
it
can
be
concealed
unfortunately
while
these
profits
are
vanishing
quinn
finds
it
very
hard
to
increase
the
other
branch
of
his
business
the
fabrics
which
he
makes
are
good
so
good
that
he
finds
it
difficult
to
sell
them
in
the
teeth
of
competition
the
country
shops
are
flooded
with
what
he
calls
an
army
of
eager
commercial
travellers
pushes
showy
goods
on
the
shopkeepers
and
the
public
at
half
his
price
even
the
farmers
in
remote
districts
are
beginning
to
acquire
a
taste
for
smartness
some
things
in
which
he
used
to
do
a
useful
trade
are
now
scarcely
worth
making
there
is
hardly
any
demand
for
the
checked
the
women
prefer
hats
and
bonnets
decked
with
cheap
ribbons
or
artificial
flowers
and
these
bring
no
trade
to
mill
still
he
manages
to
hold
on
the
lancashire
people
though
they
have
invented
flannelette
can
not
as
yet
make
a
passable
imitation
of
frieze
and
there
is
a
dublin
house
which
buys
annually
all
the
blankets
he
can
turn
out
it
is
true
that
even
there
and
for
the
best
class
of
customers
prices
have
to
be
cut
so
as
to
leave
a
bare
margin
of
profit
yet
since
there
is
a
margin
quinn
holds
on
though
not
very
hopefully
hyacinth
left
the
bulk
of
his
luggage
a
containing
the
books
which
the
auctioneer
had
failed
to
dispose
of
in
carrowkeel
at
the
station
and
walked
into
ballymoy
carrying
his
bag
he
had
little
difficulty
in
making
his
way
to
the
mill
and
found
the
owner
of
it
in
his
office
it
was
difficult
at
first
to
believe
that
james
quinn
could
be
any
relation
to
captain
albert
the
traveller
soldier
and
thief
this
man
was
tall
though
he
stooped
when
he
stood
to
receive
his
visitor
his
movements
were
slow
his
fair
hair
lay
thin
across
his
forehead
and
was
touched
above
the
ears
with
gray
his
blue
eyes
were
very
gentle
and
had
a
way
of
looking
long
and
steadily
at
what
they
saw
a
glance
at
his
face
left
the
impression
that
life
perhaps
by
no
very
gentle
means
had
taught
him
patience
letter
will
introduce
me
said
hyacinth
is
from
your
brother
captain
or
albert
james
quinn
took
the
letter
and
turned
it
over
slowly
then
without
opening
it
he
laid
it
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
his
eyes
travelled
from
it
to
face
and
rested
there
it
was
some
time
before
he
spoke
and
then
it
was
to
correct
hyacinth
upon
a
trivial
point
he
said
father
married
twice
and
albert
is
the
son
of
his
second
wife
you
may
have
noticed
that
he
is
a
great
deal
younger
than
i
looks
younger
certainly
said
hyacinth
for
the
other
was
waiting
for
a
reply
twenty
years
younger
albert
is
only
just
the
exact
age
of
the
captain
was
uninteresting
and
seemed
to
be
beside
the
purpose
of
the
visit
hyacinth
shifted
his
chair
and
fidgeted
uncertain
what
to
do
or
say
next
gave
you
this
letter
to
me
is
he
a
friend
of
yours
james
quinn
looked
at
him
again
steadily
it
seemed
but
this
may
have
been
fancy
that
there
was
a
kindlier
expression
in
his
eyes
after
the
emphatic
repudiation
of
friendship
with
albert
at
length
he
took
up
the
letter
and
read
it
through
slowly
did
my
brother
give
you
this
letter
the
question
was
a
puzzling
one
hyacinth
had
never
thought
of
trying
to
understand
the
motives
then
the
conversation
in
the
hotel
recurred
to
him
said
that
he
wanted
to
do
a
good
turn
to
me
and
to
you
had
you
done
for
him
apparently
james
quinn
was
not
in
the
least
vexed
at
the
brevity
of
the
answers
he
received
or
disturbed
because
his
was
obviously
disagreeable
to
hyacinth
this
letter
he
went
on
referring
to
the
document
as
he
spoke
describes
you
as
a
young
man
who
is
honest
probably
religious
and
possibly
i
presume
you
know
my
brother
and
if
you
do
you
may
be
surprised
to
hear
that
i
am
quite
prepared
to
take
his
word
for
all
this
i
have
very
seldom
known
albert
to
tell
me
lies
and
i
know
why
he
should
want
to
deceive
me
in
this
case
still
i
am
a
little
puzzled
to
account
for
his
giving
you
the
letter
can
you
add
nothing
in
the
way
of
explanation
to
what
you
have
said
know
that
i
can
said
hyacinth
you
tell
me
how
you
met
my
brother
and
what
he
is
doing
now
or
where
he
is
do
not
think
i
should
be
justified
in
doing
well
i
can
understand
that
in
certain
circumstances
albert
would
be
very
grateful
to
a
man
who
would
hold
his
tongue
he
might
be
quite
willing
to
do
you
a
good
turn
if
you
undertook
to
answer
no
questions
about
he
smiled
as
he
spoke
a
little
grimly
but
there
was
laughter
lurking
in
the
corners
of
his
eyes
a
puritan
will
sometimes
smile
in
such
a
way
at
the
thought
of
a
sinful
situation
too
solemn
to
be
laughed
at
openly
but
appealing
to
a
not
entirely
atrophied
sense
of
humour
hyacinth
felt
reassured
he
said
made
no
promise
of
silence
it
is
only
that
well
i
think
james
quinn
waited
patiently
for
the
conclusion
of
the
sentence
but
hyacinth
never
arrived
at
it
this
letter
he
said
at
last
brother
asks
me
to
give
you
the
place
he
lately
held
in
my
business
now
i
want
to
press
you
to
say
anything
you
want
to
but
before
we
go
further
i
must
ask
you
this
were
you
implicated
in
the
affair
yourself
beg
your
pardon
i
quite
understand
what
you
i
suppose
that
since
my
brother
is
anxious
that
you
should
hold
your
tongue
he
has
done
something
that
bear
talking
about
were
you
implicated
in
in
whatever
the
trouble
was
not
said
hyacinth
fact
it
was
on
account
of
what
you
speak
of
as
that
i
declined
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
your
is
probably
very
much
to
your
credit
and
in
the
light
of
my
estimate
of
your
character
i
may
say
that
i
entirely
believe
what
you
say
am
i
to
understand
that
you
are
an
applicant
for
the
post
in
my
business
which
albert
held
and
which
this
letter
tells
me
i
may
consider
vacant
is
what
brought
me
down
here
said
hyacinth
you
any
other
recommendations
or
testimonials
as
to
character
to
show
me
but
there
are
several
people
who
would
answer
questions
about
me
if
you
wrote
to
them
henry
of
trinity
college
would
or
miss
augusta
goold
or
father
moran
of
carrowkeel
in
county
have
given
me
the
most
remarkable
list
of
references
i
ever
came
across
in
my
life
i
suppose
anyone
ever
before
was
recommended
for
a
post
by
a
protestant
divinity
professor
a
notoriously
violent
political
agitator
a
roman
catholic
priest
and
a
well
we
describe
my
brother
how
do
you
come
to
be
mixed
up
with
all
these
people
who
are
you
am
the
son
of
æneas
conneally
rector
of
carrowkeel
who
died
last
said
james
quinn
suppose
if
all
these
people
are
prepared
to
recommend
you
your
character
must
be
all
right
now
tell
me
do
you
know
what
the
post
is
you
are
applying
for
said
hyacinth
i
may
as
well
say
that
i
have
had
no
experience
or
business
training
i
should
suppose
from
the
way
you
have
come
to
me
well
my
brother
was
clerk
and
traveller
for
my
business
he
was
supposed
to
help
me
to
keep
accounts
and
to
push
the
sale
of
my
goods
among
the
shopkeepers
in
connaught
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
never
did
either
the
one
or
the
other
when
he
was
at
home
he
did
nothing
when
he
was
on
the
road
he
bought
and
sold
horses
i
paid
him
eighty
pounds
a
year
and
his
travelling
expenses
i
also
promised
him
a
percentage
on
the
profits
of
the
sales
he
effected
now
do
you
think
this
work
would
suit
you
might
not
be
able
to
do
it
said
hyacinth
i
should
very
much
like
to
be
allowed
to
try
i
can
understand
that
i
shall
be
very
little
use
at
first
and
i
am
willing
to
work
without
any
salary
for
a
time
perhaps
six
months
until
i
have
learned
something
about
your
now
a
offer
give
you
a
trial
if
it
was
only
for
the
sake
of
your
list
of
references
i
keep
you
six
months
without
paying
you
if
you
turn
out
to
be
any
good
at
all
and
i
think
there
must
be
something
in
you
for
gone
about
getting
this
job
in
the
queerest
way
i
ever
heard
of
would
you
like
any
time
to
make
up
your
mind
finally
before
accepting
the
post
said
hyacinth
accept
at
they
walked
together
through
the
mill
and
looked
at
the
machines
and
the
workers
the
girls
smiled
when
quinn
stopped
to
speak
to
them
and
looked
with
frank
curiosity
at
hyacinth
the
three
or
four
men
who
did
the
heavier
work
stopped
and
chatted
for
a
few
minutes
when
they
came
to
them
evidently
there
was
no
soreness
or
distrust
here
between
the
employer
and
the
employed
when
they
had
gone
through
the
rooms
where
the
work
was
going
on
they
climbed
a
staircase
like
a
ladder
and
came
to
the
loft
where
the
wool
was
stored
hyacinth
handled
it
as
he
was
directed
and
endeavoured
to
appreciate
the
difference
between
the
good
and
the
inferior
qualities
they
passed
by
an
unglazed
window
at
the
back
of
the
mill
and
quinn
pointed
out
his
own
house
it
stood
among
trees
and
shrubs
now
for
the
most
part
bare
but
giving
promise
of
shady
privacy
in
summertime
long
windows
opened
out
on
to
a
lawn
stretching
down
to
the
watercourse
which
fed
the
millwheel
a
gravel
path
skirted
one
side
of
the
house
leading
to
a
bridge
and
thence
to
a
doorway
in
a
high
wall
beyond
which
lay
the
road
as
they
looked
the
door
opened
and
a
woman
with
two
little
girls
came
through
they
crossed
the
bridge
and
walked
up
to
the
house
is
my
wife
said
quinn
my
two
little
he
stretched
out
between
the
bars
of
the
window
and
shouted
to
them
all
three
looked
back
quinn
waved
her
hand
and
the
two
children
shouted
in
reply
then
a
light
appeared
in
one
of
the
windows
and
hyacinth
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
trim
pulling
the
curtains
across
it
shall
be
having
tea
at
six
said
quinn
you
come
and
join
us
by
the
way
where
are
you
staying
hyacinth
accepted
the
invitation
and
confessed
that
he
had
not
as
yet
looked
for
any
place
to
lay
his
head
better
go
to
the
hotel
for
not
much
of
a
place
but
you
will
have
to
learn
to
put
up
with
that
sort
of
accommodation
tomorrow
try
and
find
you
some
decent
the
hotel
struck
even
hyacinth
as
of
inferior
quality
though
it
boasted
great
things
in
the
timetable
advertisements
and
called
itself
in
large
gold
letters
above
its
door
a
smell
of
whisky
and
tobacco
greeted
him
as
he
entered
and
a
waiter
with
a
greasy
coat
in
answer
to
inquiries
about
a
bed
sent
him
down
a
dark
passage
to
seek
a
lady
called
miss
sweeney
at
the
bar
large
leather
cases
with
broad
straps
and
baskets
blocked
the
passage
and
hyacinth
stumbled
among
them
for
some
time
before
he
discovered
miss
sweeney
reading
a
periodical
called
among
her
she
was
a
young
woman
of
fashionable
appearance
and
acted
apparently
in
the
double
capacity
of
barmaid
and
clerk
on
hearing
that
hyacinth
required
not
whisky
but
a
bedroom
she
requested
him
to
go
forward
to
the
office
indicating
a
glass
case
at
the
far
end
of
the
bar
counter
here
he
repeated
his
request
to
her
through
a
small
opening
in
the
glass
and
received
her
assurance
given
with
great
condescension
that
no
was
vacant
and
further
that
there
was
a
fire
in
the
commercial
room
a
boy
whom
she
summoned
carried
bag
to
an
extremely
dirty
and
bedroom
and
afterwards
conducted
him
to
the
promised
fire
two
other
guests
were
seated
at
it
when
he
entered
who
after
a
long
stare
made
room
for
him
apparently
there
was
no
one
else
stopping
in
the
hotel
and
the
whole
mass
of
cumbrous
baggage
which
blocked
the
passage
to
the
bar
must
belong
to
them
hyacinth
realized
with
a
feeling
of
disgust
which
he
could
not
account
for
that
these
were
two
members
of
his
new
profession
in
the
voyages
of
commerce
he
gathered
for
they
talked
loudly
without
regarding
his
presence
that
they
represented
two
manchester
firms
which
were
rivals
in
the
wholesale
drapery
business
very
much
of
what
they
said
was
unintelligible
to
him
though
the
words
were
familiar
he
knew
that
could
be
but
not
apparently
in
the
same
sense
in
which
they
discussed
these
operations
and
it
puzzled
him
to
hear
of
muslins
being
at
one
and
he
sat
for
a
time
wondering
at
the
waste
of
money
and
energy
involved
in
sending
these
men
to
remote
corners
of
ireland
to
search
for
customers
then
he
left
them
and
made
his
way
down
the
muddy
street
to
house
the
room
into
which
he
was
shown
was
different
from
any
he
had
ever
seen
it
was
lit
by
a
single
lamp
with
a
dull
glass
globe
and
a
turf
fire
which
burnt
brightly
two
chairs
stood
one
on
either
side
of
the
tiled
hearth
near
one
stood
a
little
table
covered
with
books
and
rising
from
among
them
a
as
yet
unlit
beyond
the
other
was
a
strewed
with
reels
and
scissors
on
which
lay
a
frock
and
some
stockings
the
table
was
laid
for
tea
on
it
were
plates
piled
up
with
floury
scones
delicate
beleek
saucers
full
of
butter
patted
thin
into
the
shapes
of
shells
and
jam
in
coloured
glass
dishes
cased
in
silver
filigree
a
large
loaf
of
soda
bread
on
a
wooden
platter
stood
at
one
end
of
the
table
and
near
it
a
at
the
other
end
was
an
array
of
cups
and
saucers
with
silver
spoons
that
glittered
a
jug
of
cream
and
one
of
milk
two
of
the
cups
were
larger
than
the
others
and
had
those
curious
bars
across
them
which
are
designed
to
save
men
from
wetting
their
moustaches
when
they
drink
no
room
and
no
preparation
for
a
meal
could
have
offered
a
more
striking
contrast
to
augusta
her
groups
of
wineglasses
multiplicity
of
knives
and
forks
and
her
candles
shrouded
in
silk
nor
was
the
dainty
neatness
less
remote
from
the
cracked
delf
and
huddled
sordidness
of
his
old
home
long
before
hyacinth
had
realized
an
impression
of
the
scene
before
him
quinn
greeted
him
and
led
him
to
the
fire
her
two
little
girls
who
lay
on
the
hearthrug
with
a
between
them
were
bidden
to
make
room
for
him
when
her
husband
appeared
she
bustled
off
and
in
a
minute
or
two
she
and
the
maid
came
in
bringing
toast
and
tea
and
hot
water
hissing
in
a
silver
urn
as
the
evening
passed
hyacinth
began
to
realize
that
he
had
entered
into
a
home
of
peace
he
felt
that
these
people
were
neither
greatly
anxious
to
be
rich
nor
much
afraid
of
being
poor
they
seemed
in
no
way
fretted
that
there
were
others
higher
in
the
social
scale
cleverer
or
more
brilliant
than
they
were
he
understood
that
they
were
both
of
them
religious
in
a
way
quite
different
from
any
he
had
known
they
neither
spoke
of
mysteries
like
his
father
nor
were
eager
about
disputings
like
the
men
who
had
been
his
they
were
living
a
very
simple
life
of
which
faith
and
a
wide
charity
formed
a
part
as
natural
as
eating
or
sleeping
when
the
bedtime
came
it
seemed
to
him
a
very
wonderful
thing
that
they
should
kneel
in
turns
beside
their
knee
and
say
their
prayers
aloud
when
he
a
stranger
was
in
the
room
it
seemed
to
him
less
strange
because
then
he
had
been
two
hours
longer
in
the
company
of
the
quinns
that
before
leaving
he
too
should
kneel
beside
his
hostess
and
listen
while
his
new
employer
repeated
the
familiar
words
of
some
of
the
old
collects
he
had
heard
his
father
read
in
church
chapter
xiv
on
sunday
the
third
day
after
his
arrival
in
ballymoy
hyacinth
went
to
church
he
could
hardly
have
avoided
doing
so
even
if
he
had
wanted
to
for
quinn
invited
him
to
share
her
pew
there
was
no
real
necessity
for
such
hospitality
for
the
church
was
never
even
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
more
than
half
full
the
four
front
seats
were
reserved
for
a
stack
on
whose
property
the
town
of
ballymoy
stood
but
this
gentleman
preferred
to
live
in
surrey
and
even
when
he
came
over
to
ireland
for
the
shooting
rarely
honoured
the
church
with
his
presence
a
stone
tablet
bearing
the
name
of
this
father
a
cork
pawnbroker
who
had
purchased
the
property
for
a
small
sum
under
the
encumbered
estates
court
act
adorned
the
wall
beside
the
pulpit
the
management
of
the
property
was
in
the
hands
of
a
dublin
firm
so
the
parish
was
deprived
of
the
privilege
of
a
resident
land
agent
the
doctor
recently
appointed
to
the
district
was
a
roman
catholic
of
plebeian
antecedents
which
reduced
the
resident
gentry
of
ballymoy
to
the
quinns
a
bank
manager
and
the
rector
canon
beecher
a
few
farmers
gamekeeper
and
the
landlady
of
the
imperial
hotel
made
up
the
rest
of
the
congregation
the
service
was
not
of
a
very
attractive
or
inspiriting
kind
canon
beecher
his
title
was
a
purely
honorary
one
not
even
involving
the
duty
of
preaching
in
the
unpretending
building
which
in
virtue
of
some
forgotten
history
was
dignified
with
the
name
of
killinacoff
cathedral
read
slowly
with
somewhat
ponderous
emphasis
his
thirty
years
in
holy
orders
had
slightly
hardened
an
originally
luscious
dublin
brogue
but
there
remained
a
certain
gentle
aspiration
of
the
and
and
a
tendency
to
omit
the
labial
consonants
altogether
he
read
an
immense
number
of
prayers
gathering
as
it
seemed
to
hyacinth
the
longest
ones
from
the
four
corners
of
the
at
intervals
he
allowed
himself
to
be
interrupted
with
a
hymn
but
resumed
afterwards
the
steady
flow
of
supplication
the
eldest
miss
beecher
the
canon
had
altogether
two
daughters
and
three
sons
played
a
harmonium
the
other
girl
and
the
three
boys
with
the
assistance
of
an
uncertain
bass
from
quinn
gave
utterance
to
the
praise
hyacinth
tried
to
join
in
the
first
hymn
which
happened
to
be
familiar
to
him
but
quavered
into
silence
towards
the
end
of
the
second
verse
discovering
that
the
eyes
of
beecher
from
her
pew
of
the
canon
from
the
of
the
vocal
miss
beecher
and
her
brothers
were
fixed
upon
him
the
sermon
proved
to
be
long
and
uninteresting
it
was
about
melchizedek
and
was
so
far
appropriate
to
the
priest
and
king
that
it
had
no
recognisable
beginning
and
need
not
apparently
have
ever
had
an
end
perhaps
no
one
unless
he
were
specially
trained
for
the
purpose
could
have
followed
right
through
the
quiet
meanderings
of
the
thought
this
kind
of
sermon
however
has
the
one
advantage
that
the
listener
can
take
it
up
and
drop
it
again
at
any
point
without
inconvenience
and
hyacinth
was
able
to
give
his
attention
to
some
sections
of
it
there
was
no
attempt
at
eloquence
or
any
kind
of
learning
displayed
but
he
understood
as
he
listened
where
the
quinns
got
their
religion
or
at
least
how
their
religion
was
kept
alive
certain
very
simple
things
were
reiterated
with
a
quiet
earnestness
which
left
no
doubt
that
the
preacher
believed
exactly
what
he
said
and
lived
by
the
light
of
his
faith
one
evening
shortly
afterwards
canon
beecher
called
upon
hyacinth
the
conversation
during
the
visit
resolved
itself
into
a
kind
of
catechism
which
curiously
enough
was
quite
inoffensive
the
canon
learnt
by
degrees
something
of
past
life
and
his
career
in
trinity
college
he
shook
his
head
gravely
over
the
friendship
with
augusta
goold
whom
he
evidently
regarded
as
almost
beyond
the
reach
of
the
grace
of
god
hyacinth
was
forced
to
admit
with
an
increasing
sense
of
shame
that
he
had
never
signed
a
temperance
pledge
did
not
read
the
organ
of
the
church
missionary
society
was
not
a
member
of
a
young
christian
association
or
even
of
a
union
he
felt
as
he
made
each
confession
sorrowfully
that
he
was
losing
all
hope
of
the
friendship
and
was
most
agreeably
surprised
when
the
interview
closed
with
a
warm
invitation
to
a
dinner
at
the
rectory
on
the
following
sunday
quinn
who
took
a
sort
of
elder
interest
in
his
goings
out
and
comings
in
was
delighted
when
she
heard
that
he
was
going
to
the
rectory
and
assured
him
that
he
would
like
both
beecher
and
the
girls
she
confided
afterwards
to
her
husband
that
the
influence
of
a
christian
home
was
likely
to
be
most
beneficial
to
the
the
rectory
displayed
none
of
the
signs
of
easy
comfort
which
had
charmed
hyacinth
in
the
house
the
floor
of
the
square
hall
was
covered
with
a
cheap
oilcloth
its
walls
were
and
the
only
furniture
consisted
of
a
wooden
chair
and
a
somewhat
rickety
table
in
the
middle
of
the
wall
hung
a
large
card
with
silver
lettering
is
the
unseen
guest
in
this
house
hyacinth
read
sharer
in
every
pleasure
the
listener
to
every
a
fortnight
before
he
would
have
turned
with
disgust
from
such
an
advertisement
but
now
since
he
had
known
the
quinns
and
listened
to
the
wandering
sermons
he
looked
at
it
with
different
eyes
he
felt
that
the
words
might
actually
express
a
fact
and
that
a
family
might
live
together
as
if
they
believed
them
to
be
true
said
the
canon
who
had
come
in
with
him
and
saw
him
gaze
at
it
are
very
nice
i
bought
several
of
them
last
time
i
was
in
dublin
and
i
think
i
have
a
spare
one
left
which
i
can
give
you
if
you
like
it
has
silver
letters
like
that
one
but
printed
on
a
crimson
evidently
the
design
and
the
colouring
were
what
struck
him
as
noticeable
the
motto
itself
was
a
commonplace
of
christian
living
the
expression
of
a
basal
fact
quite
naturally
hung
where
it
would
catch
the
eye
of
chance
visitors
in
the
beecher
and
her
two
daughters
still
in
their
hats
and
gloves
stood
round
a
turf
fire
they
made
a
place
at
once
for
hyacinth
and
one
of
the
girls
drew
forward
a
rickety
chair
covered
with
faded
cretonne
he
was
formally
introduced
to
them
miss
beecher
and
miss
elsie
beecher
had
both
the
latter
very
recently
reached
the
dignity
of
young
womanhood
and
wore
long
dresses
the
three
boys
who
were
younger
were
made
known
afterwards
when
they
went
into
the
the
canon
selected
the
soundest
of
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
chairs
for
hyacinth
and
seated
him
beside
beecher
then
the
elder
girl
miss
name
he
learnt
was
marion
entered
in
a
long
apron
carrying
a
boiled
leg
of
mutton
followed
by
her
sister
with
dishes
of
potatoes
and
mashed
parsnips
see
said
beecher
and
there
was
no
note
of
apology
in
her
voice
as
she
made
the
explanation
girls
are
accustomed
to
do
a
good
deal
of
the
we
have
only
one
servant
and
she
is
not
very
presentable
when
she
has
just
cooked
the
hyacinth
glanced
at
marion
beecher
who
smiled
at
him
with
frank
friendliness
as
she
took
her
seat
beside
her
father
he
saw
suddenly
that
the
girl
was
beautiful
he
had
not
noticed
this
in
church
there
he
had
no
opportunity
of
observing
the
subtle
grace
with
which
she
moved
and
the
left
unrevealed
the
lustrous
purity
of
her
complexion
the
radiant
red
and
white
which
only
the
warm
damp
of
the
western
seaboard
can
give
or
preserve
her
eyes
he
had
seen
even
in
the
church
but
now
first
he
realized
what
unfathomable
gentleness
and
what
a
wonder
of
frank
innocence
were
in
them
the
canon
looked
round
the
table
at
his
children
and
there
was
a
humorous
twinkle
in
his
eye
when
he
turned
to
hyacinth
and
quoted
sons
shall
grow
up
as
young
plants
and
your
daughters
shall
be
as
the
polished
corners
of
the
perhaps
of
civilized
mankind
would
regard
five
children
as
five
misfortunes
under
any
circumstances
as
quite
overwhelming
when
they
have
been
showered
on
a
man
with
a
very
small
income
who
is
obliged
to
live
in
a
remote
corner
of
ireland
apparently
the
canon
did
not
look
upon
himself
as
an
afflicted
man
at
all
there
was
an
unmistakable
sincerity
about
the
way
in
which
he
completed
his
quotation
thus
shall
the
man
be
blessed
that
feareth
the
it
dawned
on
hyacinth
that
quite
possibly
the
view
of
the
situation
might
be
the
right
one
it
was
certainly
wonderfully
pleasant
to
see
the
girls
move
through
the
room
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
actually
realized
the
almost
forgotten
ideal
of
serviceable
womanhood
the
talk
at
dinner
turned
first
on
the
ailments
of
an
old
woman
who
was
accustomed
to
clean
the
church
but
was
now
suspected
of
being
past
her
work
then
by
an
abrupt
transition
on
the
new
hat
which
the
wife
had
brought
home
from
dublin
and
finally
the
connection
of
thought
being
again
far
from
obvious
on
the
hymns
which
had
been
sung
that
morning
it
was
at
this
point
that
hyacinth
was
included
in
the
conversation
marion
beecher
announced
that
one
of
the
hymns
was
a
special
favourite
of
hers
because
she
remembered
her
mother
singing
the
younger
children
to
sleep
with
it
when
they
were
babies
she
caught
hyacinth
looking
at
her
while
she
spoke
and
said
to
him
you
sing
conneally
do
a
then
you
must
come
and
help
us
in
the
seemed
a
grandiose
name
for
the
four
beechers
and
quinn
but
marion
who
had
little
experience
of
anything
better
had
no
misgivings
hope
you
sing
tenor
i
always
long
to
have
a
tenor
in
my
choir
why
we
might
have
one
of
anthems
at
easter
and
we
been
able
to
sing
one
since
nash
left
the
hyacinth
had
never
sung
a
part
in
his
life
and
could
not
read
music
but
he
grew
bold
and
professing
to
have
an
excellent
ear
said
he
was
willing
to
learn
the
prospect
of
a
long
series
of
choir
practices
conducted
by
marion
beecher
seemed
to
him
just
then
an
extremely
pleasant
one
after
dinner
while
the
two
girls
cleared
away
the
plates
and
dishes
canon
beecher
invited
hyacinth
to
smoke
never
learnt
the
habit
myself
he
said
so
much
the
fashion
in
my
young
days
as
it
is
now
but
i
have
no
objection
whatever
to
the
hyacinth
lit
a
cigarette
apologetically
it
seemed
to
him
almost
a
wicked
thing
to
do
but
his
host
evidently
wished
him
to
be
comfortable
their
talk
after
the
girls
had
left
the
room
turned
on
politics
confession
of
his
friendship
with
augusta
goold
had
impressed
the
canon
and
he
delivered
himself
of
a
very
kindly
little
lecture
on
the
duty
of
loyalty
and
the
sinfulness
of
contention
with
the
powers
that
be
his
way
of
putting
the
matter
neither
irritated
hyacinth
like
the
flamboyant
imperialism
of
the
trinity
students
nor
drove
him
into
like
contemptuous
reasonableness
still
he
felt
bound
to
make
some
sort
of
defence
of
the
opinions
which
were
still
his
own
he
said
must
be
some
limit
to
the
duty
of
loyalty
if
a
government
has
no
constitutional
right
to
rule
is
a
man
bound
to
be
loyal
to
it
think
said
the
canon
the
question
is
decided
for
us
is
it
not
conneally
unto
you
remember
the
verse
even
if
the
government
were
as
unconstitutional
as
you
appear
to
think
it
would
not
be
more
so
than
the
roman
government
of
judaea
when
these
words
were
hyacinth
pondered
this
answer
it
opened
up
to
him
an
entirely
new
way
of
looking
at
the
subject
and
he
could
see
that
it
might
be
necessary
for
a
christian
to
acquiesce
without
an
attempt
at
resistance
in
any
government
which
happened
to
exist
he
remembered
other
verses
in
the
new
testament
which
could
be
quoted
even
more
conclusively
in
favour
of
this
passive
obedience
yet
he
felt
that
there
must
be
a
fallacy
lurking
somewhere
it
was
on
the
face
of
it
an
obvious
absurdity
to
think
that
a
man
because
he
happened
to
be
a
christian
was
therefore
bound
to
submit
to
any
form
of
tyranny
or
oppression
he
said
only
say
suppose
that
a
government
did
immoral
things
that
it
robbed
or
allowed
people
to
rob
would
it
still
be
right
to
be
loyal
think
so
said
the
canon
quietly
hyacinth
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
you
mean
to
say
that
you
yourself
would
be
loyal
under
such
circumstances
prefer
not
to
discuss
the
question
in
that
personal
way
but
the
church
to
which
you
and
i
belong
is
loyal
still
although
the
government
has
robbed
us
of
our
property
and
our
position
and
although
it
is
now
allowing
our
people
to
be
robbed
still
mean
by
the
disestablishment
and
the
land
acts
i
think
it
is
our
great
glory
that
our
loyalty
is
imperishable
that
it
survives
even
such
treatment
as
we
have
received
and
are
is
very
beautiful
said
hyacinth
slowly
see
that
there
is
a
great
nobility
in
such
loyalty
although
i
do
not
even
wish
to
share
it
myself
you
see
i
am
an
irishman
and
i
want
to
see
my
country
great
and
suppose
said
the
canon
it
is
very
natural
that
we
should
love
the
spot
on
earth
in
which
we
live
i
think
that
i
love
ireland
too
but
we
must
remember
that
our
citizenship
is
in
heaven
and
it
seems
to
me
that
any
departure
from
the
laws
of
the
king
of
that
country
dishonours
us
and
even
dishonours
the
earthly
country
which
we
call
our
hyacinth
said
nothing
there
flashed
across
him
a
recollection
of
augusta
hope
that
some
final
insult
would
one
day
goad
the
irish
protestants
into
disloyalty
clearly
if
canon
beecher
was
to
be
regarded
as
a
type
she
had
no
conception
of
the
religious
spirit
of
the
church
of
ireland
but
was
there
anyone
else
like
this
clergyman
he
did
not
know
but
he
guessed
that
his
friends
the
quinns
would
think
of
the
matter
in
somewhat
the
same
way
it
seemed
to
him
quite
possible
that
in
scattered
and
remote
parishes
this
strangely
unreasonable
conception
of
christianity
might
survive
after
a
pause
the
canon
went
on
must
not
think
that
i
do
not
love
ireland
too
i
look
forward
to
seeing
her
free
some
day
but
with
the
freedom
of
the
gospel
it
will
not
be
in
my
time
i
know
but
surely
it
will
come
to
pass
our
people
have
still
the
simple
faith
of
the
early
ages
and
they
have
many
very
beautiful
virtues
they
only
want
the
dawn
of
the
dayspring
from
on
high
to
shine
on
them
and
then
ireland
will
be
once
more
the
island
of
saints
he
dwelt
tenderly
on
the
two
words
do
not
think
it
will
matter
much
then
what
earthly
government
bears
rule
over
us
but
come
i
see
that
you
have
finished
your
smoke
and
i
must
go
to
my
study
to
think
over
my
when
hyacinth
entered
the
the
girls
surrounded
him
asking
him
for
answers
to
a
printed
list
of
questions
it
appeared
that
the
committee
of
a
bazaar
for
some
charity
in
which
it
was
right
to
be
interested
had
issued
a
sort
of
and
promised
a
prize
to
the
best
answerer
the
questions
were
all
of
one
kind
is
the
modern
athens
the
eternal
city
the
city
of
the
tribes
who
was
the
wizard
of
the
north
the
bulwark
of
the
protestant
faith
the
earlier
names
on
the
list
presented
little
difficulty
to
hyacinth
marion
took
down
his
answers
whilst
elsie
murmured
a
pleasant
chorus
of
astonishment
at
his
cleverness
suddenly
he
came
to
a
dead
stop
was
the
martyr
of
melanesia
have
never
heard
of
him
said
hyacinth
heard
of
the
martyr
of
melanesia
said
elsie
we
knew
that
at
said
marion
was
an
article
on
him
in
last
surely
you
read
the
conneally
hyacinth
felt
eyes
fixed
on
him
with
something
of
a
reproach
in
them
he
wrestled
with
a
vague
recollection
of
having
somewhere
heard
the
name
of
the
periodical
for
a
moment
he
thought
of
risking
and
saying
that
he
had
only
missed
the
last
number
then
he
suddenly
remembered
the
card
with
silver
lettering
which
hung
above
his
coat
in
the
hall
and
told
the
truth
with
even
a
quite
unnecessary
aggravation
i
never
remember
seeing
a
copy
of
it
in
my
life
i
even
know
what
it
is
said
the
girls
with
horror
think
and
we
all
have
is
a
missionary
periodical
said
marion
has
news
in
it
from
every
corner
of
the
and
every
month
a
list
of
the
stations
that
specially
need
our
hyacinth
left
the
rectory
that
night
with
three
numbers
of
the
in
his
pocket
afterwards
he
had
many
talks
with
canon
beecher
and
the
quinns
about
the
work
of
the
missionary
societies
he
learnt
to
his
surprise
that
really
immense
sums
of
money
were
subscribed
every
year
by
members
of
the
church
of
ireland
for
the
conversion
of
the
heathen
in
very
remote
parts
of
the
world
it
could
not
be
denied
that
these
contributions
represented
genuine
young
men
went
without
a
sufficiency
of
tobacco
and
refrained
from
buying
new
ladies
with
the
smallest
means
at
their
command
reared
marketable
chickens
and
sold
their
own
marmalade
and
cakes
in
such
ways
and
not
from
the
superfluity
of
the
rich
many
thousands
of
pounds
were
gathered
annually
it
was
still
more
wonderful
to
him
to
discover
that
large
numbers
of
young
men
and
women
and
these
the
most
able
and
energetic
devoted
themselves
to
this
foreign
service
and
that
their
brothers
and
sisters
at
home
were
banded
together
in
unions
to
watch
their
doings
and
to
pray
for
them
he
found
himself
entirely
untouched
by
this
enthusiasm
in
spite
of
the
beautiful
expression
it
found
in
the
lives
of
his
new
friends
but
it
astonished
him
greatly
that
there
should
be
this
potent
energy
in
the
irish
church
the
utter
helplessness
of
its
bishops
and
clergy
in
irish
affairs
the
total
indifference
of
its
people
to
every
effort
at
national
regeneration
had
led
him
to
believe
that
the
church
itself
was
moribund
now
he
discovered
that
there
was
in
it
an
amazing
vitality
a
capacity
of
giving
birth
to
enthusiastic
souls
the
knowledge
brought
with
it
first
of
all
a
feeling
of
intense
irritation
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
religions
were
in
league
against
ireland
the
roman
church
seized
the
scanty
savings
of
one
section
of
the
people
and
squandered
them
in
buying
german
glass
and
italian
marble
were
the
protestants
any
better
when
they
spent
a
year
on
chinamen
and
negroes
the
roman
catholics
took
the
best
of
their
boys
and
girls
to
make
priests
and
nuns
of
them
the
protestants
were
doing
the
same
thing
when
they
shipped
off
their
young
men
and
young
women
to
spend
their
strength
among
savages
both
were
robbing
ireland
of
what
ireland
needed
most
money
and
vitality
he
would
not
say
even
to
himself
that
all
this
religious
enthusiasm
was
so
much
ardour
wasted
no
doubt
the
roman
priest
did
good
work
in
chicago
as
the
protestant
missionary
did
in
uganda
only
it
seemed
to
him
that
of
all
lands
ireland
needed
most
the
service
and
the
prayers
of
those
of
her
children
who
had
the
capacity
of
afterwards
when
he
thought
more
deeply
he
found
a
great
hope
in
the
very
existence
of
all
this
altruistic
enthusiasm
he
had
a
vision
of
all
that
might
be
done
for
ireland
if
only
the
splendid
energy
of
her
own
children
could
be
used
in
her
service
he
tried
more
than
once
to
explain
his
point
of
view
quinn
met
him
with
blank
disbelief
in
any
possible
future
for
ireland
country
is
doomed
he
said
people
are
lazy
thriftless
and
the
best
of
them
are
flying
to
america
and
those
that
remain
are
dying
away
drifting
into
lunatic
asylums
hospitals
and
workhouses
there
is
a
curse
upon
us
in
another
twenty
years
there
will
be
no
irish
people
at
least
none
in
ireland
then
the
english
and
scotch
will
come
and
make
something
of
the
from
canon
beecher
he
met
with
scarcely
more
sympathy
or
understanding
he
admitted
doubt
we
ought
to
make
more
efforts
than
we
do
to
convert
our
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
how
we
are
to
go
to
work
there
is
one
society
which
exists
for
this
purpose
its
friends
are
full
of
the
very
kind
of
enthusiasm
which
you
describe
i
could
point
you
out
plenty
of
its
agents
whose
whole
souls
are
in
their
work
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
how
completely
they
are
said
hyacinth
do
not
in
the
least
mean
that
we
should
start
more
missions
to
roman
catholics
it
does
not
seem
to
me
to
matter
much
what
kind
of
religion
a
man
professes
and
i
should
be
most
unwilling
to
uproot
belief
what
we
ought
to
do
is
throw
our
whole
force
and
energy
into
the
work
of
regenerating
ireland
it
is
possible
for
us
to
do
this
and
we
ought
to
well
said
the
canon
must
not
let
you
make
me
argue
with
you
conneally
but
i
hope
you
preach
these
doctrines
of
yours
to
my
daughters
i
think
it
is
better
for
them
to
drop
their
pennies
into
missionary
and
leave
the
tangled
problems
of
irish
politics
to
those
better
able

chapter

there
are
certain
professions
in
themselves
honest
useful
and
even
estimable
for
which
society
has
agreed
to
entertain
a
feeling
of
contempt
it
is
for
instance
very
difficult
to
think
of
a
curate
as
anything
except
a
butt
for
satirists
or
to
be
respectful
to
the
profession
of
tailoring
although
many
a
man
for
private
pecuniary
reasons
is
meek
before
the
particular
individual
who
makes
his
clothes
yet
the
novelist
and
the
playwright
who
hold
the
mirror
up
to
modern
humanity
are
occasionally
kind
even
to
curates
and
tailors
there
is
a
youthful
athlete
in
holy
orders
who
thrashes
to
our
immense
admiration
the
village
bully
bewildering
his
victim
and
his
admirers
with
his
mastery
of
what
is
described
a
little
vaguely
as
the
oxford
once
at
least
a
glamour
of
romance
has
been
shed
over
the
son
of
a
tailor
and
it
becomes
imaginable
that
even
the
chalker
of
unfinished
coats
may
in
the
future
be
posed
as
heroic
there
is
still
however
a
profession
which
no
eccentric
novelist
has
ever
ventured
to
represent
as
other
than
entirely
contemptible
the
commercial
traveller
is
beneath
satire
and
outside
the
region
of
sympathy
if
he
appears
at
all
in
fiction
or
on
the
stage
he
is
irredeemably
vulgar
he
is
never
heroic
never
even
a
villain
rarely
comic
always
poor
man
objectionable
this
is
a
peculiar
thing
in
the
literature
of
a
people
like
the
english
who
are
not
ashamed
to
glory
in
their
commercial
success
and
are
always
ready
to
cheer
a
politician
who
professes
to
have
the
interests
of
trade
at
heart
amid
the
current
eulogies
of
the
working
man
and
the
apotheosis
of
the
beings
called
of
industry
the
bagman
surely
ought
to
find
at
least
an
apologist
without
him
it
seems
likely
that
many
articles
would
fail
to
find
a
place
in
the
windows
of
the
provincial
shopkeepers
without
him
large
sections
of
the
public
would
probably
remain
ignorant
for
years
of
new
brands
of
cigarettes
and
dyspeptic
people
might
never
come
across
the
foods
which
americans
prepare
for
their
use
also
the
individual
bagman
is
often
not
without
his
charm
he
knows
if
not
courts
and
princes
at
least
hotels
and
railway
companies
he
is
on
terms
of
easy
familiarity
with
every
in
several
counties
he
can
calculate
to
a
nicety
how
long
a
train
is
likely
to
be
delayed
by
a
fair
along
the
he
is
also
full
of
information
about
local
politics
in
connaught
for
instance
an
experienced
member
of
the
profession
will
gauge
for
you
the
exact
strength
of
the
existing
league
in
any
district
he
knows
what
publicans
may
be
regarded
as
men
and
who
have
leanings
towards
independence
his
knowledge
is
frequently
minute
and
he
can
prophesy
the
result
of
a
district
council
election
by
reckoning
up
the
number
of
leading
men
who
read
the
and
weighing
them
against
those
who
delight
in
the
pages
of
the
the
men
who
can
do
these
things
are
themselves
local
they
reside
in
their
district
and
as
a
rule
push
the
sales
and
collect
the
debts
of
local
brewers
and
the
representatives
of
the
larger
english
firms
only
make
their
rounds
twice
or
three
times
a
year
and
are
less
interesting
they
pay
the
penalty
of
being
cosmopolitan
and
tend
to
become
superficial
in
their
judgment
of
men
and
things
hyacinth
like
most
members
of
the
public
was
ignorant
of
the
greatness
and
interest
of
his
new
profession
he
entered
upon
it
with
some
misgiving
and
viewed
his
trunk
of
sample
blankets
and
shawls
with
disgust
even
a
new
overcoat
though
warm
and
weatherproof
afforded
him
little
joy
being
itself
a
sample
of
frieze
one
thought
alone
cheered
him
and
even
generated
a
little
enthusiasm
for
his
work
it
occurred
to
him
that
in
selling
the
produce
of
the
ballymoy
mill
he
was
advancing
the
industrial
revival
of
ireland
he
knew
that
other
people
quite
heroic
figures
were
working
for
the
same
end
a
government
board
found
joyous
scope
for
the
energies
of
its
officials
in
giving
advice
to
people
who
wanted
to
cure
fish
or
make
lace
it
earned
the
blessing
which
is
to
rest
upon
those
who
are
reviled
and
evil
spoken
of
for
no
one
except
literary
people
who
write
for
english
magazines
ever
had
a
good
word
for
it
there
were
also
those
their
activity
took
the
form
of
letters
to
the
newspapers
who
desired
to
utilize
the
artistic
capacity
of
the
celt
and
to
enrich
the
world
with
beautiful
fabrics
and
carpentry
they
too
were
workers
in
the
cause
of
the
revival
then
there
were
great
ladies
the
very
cream
of
the
aristocracy
who
petted
tweeds
and
stockings
and
offered
magnificent
prizes
to
industrious
cottagers
they
earned
quite
large
sums
of
money
for
their
protégés
by
holding
sales
in
places
like
belfast
and
manchester
where
titles
can
be
judiciously
cheapened
to
a
wealthy
bourgeoisie
and
the
wives
of
and
will
spend
cheerfully
in
return
for
the
privilege
of
shaking
hands
with
a
countess
a
crowd
of
minor
enthusiasts
fostered
such
industries
as
sprigging
and
there
was
one
man
who
believed
that
the
future
prosperity
of
ireland
might
be
secured
by
teaching
people
to
make
dolls
it
was
altogether
a
noble
army
and
even
a
commercial
traveller
might
hold
his
head
high
in
the
world
if
he
counted
himself
one
of
its
soldiers
hitherto
results
have
not
been
at
all
commensurate
with
the
amount
of
ink
expended
in
magazine
articles
and
advertisements
yet
something
has
been
accomplished
nunneries
here
and
there
have
been
induced
to
accept
presents
of
and
people
have
begun
to
regard
as
somehow
sacred
the
words
the
national
board
of
education
has
also
spent
a
large
sum
of
money
in
reviving
among
its
teachers
the
almost
forgotten
art
of
making
paper
boats
hyacinth
very
soon
discovered
that
his
patriotic
view
of
this
work
did
not
commend
itself
to
his
brother
travellers
he
found
that
they
had
no
feeling
but
one
of
contempt
for
people
whom
they
regarded
as
meddling
amateurs
occasionally
when
some
convent
under
a
bustling
mother
superior
advanced
from
the
region
of
sales
at
exhibitions
into
the
competition
of
the
open
market
contempt
became
dislike
and
wishes
were
expressed
in
quite
unsuitable
language
that
the
good
ladies
would
mind
their
own
proper
business
until
hyacinth
learnt
to
conceal
his
hopes
of
future
as
a
manufacturing
country
he
was
regarded
with
suspicion
no
one
of
course
objected
to
his
making
what
use
he
could
of
patriotism
as
an
advertisement
but
he
was
given
to
understand
that
like
other
advertisements
it
could
not
be
quoted
among
the
initiated
without
a
serious
breach
of
good
manners
even
as
an
advertisement
it
was
not
rated
highly
there
was
an
elderly
gentleman
stout
and
somewhat
bibulous
who
superintended
the
consumption
of
certain
brands
of
american
cigarettes
in
the
province
of
connaught
hyacinth
met
him
in
the
exceedingly
dirty
railway
hotel
at
knock
since
there
were
no
other
guests
and
the
evening
was
wet
the
two
were
thrown
upon
each
society
in
the
think
said
hollywell
in
reply
to
a
remark
of
the
least
use
trying
to
drag
patriotic
sentiment
into
business
of
course
since
you
represent
an
irish
house
woollen
goods
i
think
you
said
quite
right
to
run
the
fact
for
all
worth
i
in
the
least
blame
you
only
i
think
find
it
he
sipped
his
it
was
still
early
and
he
had
only
arrived
at
his
third
glass
and
then
proceeded
to
give
his
personal
experience
i
work
for
an
american
firm
if
there
was
any
force
in
the
patriotic
idea
i
sell
a
single
cigarette
my
people
are
in
the
big
tobacco
combine
you
must
have
read
the
sort
of
things
the
newspapers
wrote
about
us
when
we
started
from
any
point
of
view
british
imperial
or
irish
national
we
should
have
been
boycotted
long
ago
if
patriotism
had
anything
to
do
with
trade
but
look
at
the
facts
our
chief
rivals
in
this
district
are
two
irish
firms
they
advertise
in
gaelic
which
is
a
mistake
to
start
with
because
nobody
can
read
it
they
get
the
newspaper
people
to
write
articles
recommending
a
home
to
public
support
they
get
local
branches
of
all
the
different
leagues
to
pass
resolutions
pledging
their
members
to
smoke
only
irish
tobacco
but
until
quite
lately
they
simply
have
a
look
asked
hyacinth
your
things
cheaper
or
better
said
the
other
think
they
were
either
you
see
prices
are
bound
to
come
out
pretty
even
in
the
long
run
and
i
should
say
that
if
anything
they
sold
a
slightly
better
article
hard
to
say
exactly
why
we
beat
them
when
competition
is
really
keen
a
lot
of
little
things
that
you
would
hardly
notice
make
all
the
difference
for
one
thing
i
get
a
free
hand
in
the
matter
of
subscribing
to
local
bazaars
and
often
taken
as
much
as
a
worth
of
tickets
for
a
note
that
some
priest
was
raffling
in
aid
of
a
new
chapel
wonderful
the
orders
you
can
get
from
shopkeepers
in
that
kind
of
way
then
we
get
our
things
up
better
look
at
he
handed
hyacinth
a
packet
with
a
picture
of
a
handsome
brown
dog
on
it
it
said
hollywell
give
away
twenty
or
thirty
of
those
packets
every
week
now
look
inside
what
have
you
oh
one
of
a
series
of
photos
of
first
line
of
lots
of
people
go
on
buying
those
cigarettes
just
to
get
a
complete
collection
of
the
photos
we
supply
an
album
to
keep
them
in
for
one
and
sixpence
another
of
our
makes
which
has
pictures
of
actresses
and
pretty
women
they
are
extraordinarily
popular
perfectly
all
right
of
course
from
the
moral
point
of
view
but
one
in
every
ten
is
in
tights
or
sitting
with
her
legs
very
much
crossed
just
to
keep
up
the
expectation
very
queer
the
people
who
go
for
those
photos
expect
it
to
be
young
men
but
it
the
subject
was
not
particularly
interesting
to
hyacinth
but
since
his
companion
was
evidently
anxious
to
go
on
talking
he
asked
the
expected
question
women
said
hollywell
found
it
out
quite
by
accident
i
got
a
lot
of
complaints
from
one
particular
town
that
our
cigarettes
had
no
photos
with
them
i
discovered
after
a
while
that
a
girl
in
one
of
the
principal
shops
had
hit
on
a
dodge
for
getting
out
the
photos
without
apparently
injuring
the
packets
the
funny
thing
was
that
she
never
touched
the
ironclads
or
the
of
the
soldiers
of
all
nations
which
you
might
have
thought
would
interest
her
but
she
collared
every
single
actress
and
had
duplicates
of
most
of
them
and
she
an
exception
most
girls
goad
their
young
men
to
buy
these
cigarettes
and
make
collections
of
the
photos
queer
it
i
imagine
why
they
do
said
just
now
said
hyacinth
latterly
you
done
quite
so
well
did
you
run
out
of
actresses
and
battleships
but
one
of
the
irish
firms
took
to
offering
prizes
and
enclosing
coupons
you
collected
twenty
coupons
and
you
got
a
girls
again
you
see
or
two
thousand
coupons
and
you
got
a
new
bicycle
an
old
dodge
of
course
but
somehow
it
always
seems
to
pay
however
all
this
matter
to
you
all
i
wanted
was
to
show
you
that
there
is
no
use
relying
on
patriotism
the
thing
to
go
in
for
in
any
business
is
attractive
novelties
cheap
lines
and
in
the
country
shops
long
it
was
not
very
long
before
hyacinth
began
to
realize
the
soundness
of
contempt
for
patriotism
in
the
town
of
clogher
he
found
the
walls
placarded
with
the
advertisements
of
an
draper
annseo
he
read
irish
house
support
home
another
placard
was
even
more
vehement
in
its
appeal
curse
england
it
asked
support
her
manufacturers
try
the
the
sentiments
were
so
admirable
that
hyacinth
followed
the
advice
and
tried
the
shop
was
crowded
when
he
entered
for
it
was
market
day
in
clogher
the
irish
whose
manners
otherwise
are
the
best
in
the
world
have
one
really
objectionable
habit
in
the
street
or
in
a
crowded
building
they
push
their
way
to
the
spot
they
want
to
reach
without
the
smallest
regard
for
the
feelings
of
anyone
who
happens
to
be
in
the
way
sturdy
carrying
baskets
which
doubled
the
passage
room
they
required
hustled
hyacinth
into
a
corner
and
for
a
time
defeated
his
efforts
to
emerge
getting
his
case
of
samples
safely
between
his
legs
he
amused
himself
watching
the
patriot
shopkeeper
and
his
assistants
conducting
their
business
it
was
perfectly
obvious
that
in
one
respect
the
announcements
of
the
attractive
placard
departed
from
the
truth
was
not
a
man
he
charged
for
every
article
what
he
thought
his
customers
were
likely
to
pay
the
result
was
that
every
sale
involved
prolonged
bargaining
and
heated
argument
in
most
cases
no
harm
was
done
the
were
keenly
alive
to
the
value
of
their
money
and
evidently
enjoyed
the
process
of
beating
down
the
price
by
halfpennies
until
the
real
value
of
the
article
was
reached
then
and
his
assistants
were
accustomed
to
close
the
haggle
with
a
beautiful
formula
they
said
with
confidential
smiles
and
flattering
emphasis
on
the
pronoun
the
price
will
be
one
and
a
penny
but
really
there
will
be
no
profit
on
the
occasionally
with
timid
and
inexperienced
customers
method
proved
its
value
hyacinth
saw
him
sell
a
of
serge
to
a
young
woman
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
for
a
penny
a
yard
more
than
he
had
charged
a
moment
before
for
the
same
material
another
thing
which
struck
him
as
he
watched
was
the
small
amount
of
actual
cash
which
was
paid
across
the
counter
most
of
the
women
even
those
who
seemed
quite
poor
had
accounts
in
the
shop
and
did
not
shrink
from
increasing
them
once
or
twice
a
stranger
presented
some
sort
of
a
letter
of
introduction
and
was
at
once
accommodated
with
apparently
unlimited
credit
at
length
there
was
a
lull
in
the
business
and
hyacinth
succeeded
in
spreading
his
goods
on
a
vacant
counter
and
attracting
the
attention
of
he
began
with
shawls
hope
he
said
you
will
give
me
a
good
order
for
these
fingered
them
knowingly
he
said
hyacinth
mentioned
a
sum
which
left
a
fair
margin
of
profit
for
quinn
shook
his
head
and
laughed
do
hyacinth
reduced
his
price
at
once
as
far
as
possible
use
said
compared
with
the
suave
oratory
to
which
he
treated
his
customers
this
extreme
economy
of
words
was
striking
here
he
said
producing
a
bundle
of
shawls
from
a
shelf
beside
him
get
these
for
shillings
a
dozen
less
from
thompson
and
taylor
of
hyacinth
looked
at
them
curiously
each
bore
a
prominent
label
setting
forth
a
name
for
the
garment
in
large
letters
surrounded
with
wreaths
of
shamrocks
colleen
bawn
he
read
own
kathleen
mavourneen
cruiskeen
the
appropriateness
of
this
last
title
was
not
obvious
to
the
mere
irishman
but
the
colour
of
the
garment
was
green
so
perhaps
there
was
a
connection
of
thought
in
the
mind
between
that
and
he
may
have
taken
for
the
name
of
a
place
these
asked
hyacinth
you
advertise
as
irish
goods
cleared
his
throat
twice
before
he
replied
are
got
up
specially
for
the
irish
in
the
interests
of
his
employer
hyacinth
kept
his
temper
but
the
effort
was
a
severe
one
he
said
half
cotton
mine
are
pure
wool
they
are
really
far
better
value
even
if
they
were
double
the
shrugged
his
shoulders
say
not
but
i
should
not
sell
one
of
yours
for
every
dozen
of
the
said
hyacinth
them
a
fair
chance
tell
the
people
that
they
will
last
twice
as
long
tell
them
that
they
are
made
in
would
not
be
the
slightest
use
they
would
simply
laugh
in
my
face
my
customers
care
a
pin
where
the
goods
are
made
i
have
never
in
my
life
been
asked
for
irish
why
on
earth
do
you
stick
up
those
advertisements
said
hyacinth
pointing
to
the
which
appeared
on
a
hoarding
across
the
street
was
perfectly
frank
and
unashamed
other
drapery
house
in
the
town
is
owned
by
a
scotchman
and
of
course
it
pays
more
or
less
to
keep
on
saying
that
i
am
irish
besides
i
mean
to
stand
for
the
urban
council
in
march
and
those
sort
of
ads
are
useful
at
an
election
even
if
they
are
no
good
for
tell
you
what
do
said
hyacinth
shirking
a
discussion
on
the
morality
of
advertising
let
you
have
a
dozen
shawls
at
cost
price
and
take
back
what
you
sell
if
you
give
me
your
word
to
do
your
best
for
similar
discussions
followed
the
display
of
serges
and
blankets
it
appeared
that
goods
could
be
sent
over
from
england
at
lower
prices
it
was
vain
for
hyacinth
to
press
the
fact
that
his
things
were
better
admitted
as
much
what
am
i
to
do
the
people
want
what
is
good
they
want
a
cheap
article
which
looks
well
and
they
care
a
pin
whether
the
thing
is
made
in
england
ireland
or
america
take
my
advice
he
added
as
hyacinth
left
the
shop
your
boss
to
do
inferior
lines
cheap
cheap
and
so
far
opinions
were
entirely
justified
the
appeal
of
the
patriotic
press
to
the
public
and
the
shopkeepers
on
behalf
of
the
industrial
revival
of
ireland
had
certainly
not
affected
the
town
of
clogher
hyacinth
was
bitterly
disappointed
but
hope
when
it
is
born
of
enthusiasm
dies
hard
and
he
was
greatly
interested
in
a
speech
which
he
read
one
day
in
the
it
had
been
made
at
a
meeting
of
the
league
by
an
ardnaree
shopkeeper
called
dowling
a
trade
rival
the
fact
of
the
rivalry
was
not
emphasized
had
advertised
in
a
scotch
paper
for
a
milliner
dowling
was
exceedingly
indignant
he
quoted
emigration
statistics
showing
the
number
of
girls
who
left
mayo
every
year
for
the
united
states
he
pointed
out
that
all
of
them
might
be
employed
at
home
as
milliners
or
otherwise
if
only
the
public
would
boycott
shops
which
sold
english
goods
or
employed
scotch
milliners
he
more
than
suspected
that
the
obnoxious
advertisement
was
part
of
an
organized
attempt
to
effect
a
new
plantation
of
connaught
than
the
fact
that
connaught
was
the
only
part
of
ireland
which
cromwell
did
not
propose
to
plant
escaped
the
notice
of
both
dowling
and
his
audience
the
speech
concluded
with
a
passionate
peroration
and
a
verse
no
doubt
declaimed
soundingly
of
hyacinth
made
an
expedition
to
ardnaree
and
called
hopefully
on
the
orator
his
reception
was
depressing
in
the
extreme
the
shop
which
was
large
and
imposing
was
stocked
with
goods
which
were
obviously
english
and
dowling
curtly
refused
even
to
look
at
the
samples
of
manufactures
hyacinth
quoted
his
own
speech
to
the
man
and
was
amazed
at
the
cynical
indifference
with
which
he
ignored
the
dilemma
is
one
thing
he
said
politics
is
something
entirely
hyacinth
lost
his
temper
completely
shall
write
to
the
papers
he
said
expose
you
i
shall
have
your
speech
reprinted
and
along
with
it
an
account
of
the
way
you
conduct
your
a
mean
hard
smile
crossed
mouth
before
he
answered
you
know
that
my
wife
is
the
niece
hyacinth
stared
at
him
for
a
minute
or
two
he
entirely
failed
to
understand
what
relationship
to
a
great
ecclesiastic
had
to
do
with
the
question
at
last
a
light
broke
on
him
mean
that
an
editor
print
my
letter
because
he
would
be
afraid
of
offending
a
roman
catholic
archbishop
the
expression
caught
attention
you
a
protestant
he
asked
are
a
dirty
protestant
and
you
dare
to
come
here
into
my
own
house
and
insult
me
and
trample
on
my
religious
convictions
a
catholic
and
a
member
of
the
league
what
do
you
mean
you
souper
you
by
talking
to
me
about
irish
manufactures
get
out
of
this
house
and
go
to
the
hell
waiting
for
you
as
hyacinth
turned
to
go
there
flashed
across
his
mind
the
recollection
of
miss
goold
and
her
friends
who
wrote
for
the
one
paper
in
ireland
anyhow
he
said
is
not
afraid
of
your
wife
nor
your
archbishop
write
to
the
and
see
if
they
publish
the
dowling
grinned
care
if
they
do
he
said
priests
are
dead
against
the
and
hardly
a
man
in
the
town
reads
it
go
up
there
now
to
and
try
if
you
can
buy
a
copy
i
tell
you
it
on
sale
here
at
all
and
whatever
they
publish
will
do
me
no
when
hyacinth
returned
to
the
hotel
he
found
holywell
seated
with
the
inevitable
beside
him
in
the
conneally
he
said
how
is
patriotism
paying
you
find
people
ready
to
buy
irish
hyacinth
boiling
over
with
indignation
related
his
experience
with
dowling
did
i
tell
you
said
hollywell
anyhow
just
as
well
out
of
a
deal
with
that
fellow
i
care
to
do
business
with
him
myself
i
happen
to
know
and
you
may
take
my
word
for
his
voice
sunk
to
a
confidential
whisper
very
deep
in
the
books
of
two
english
firms
and
that
he
simply
place
an
order
with
anyone
else
have
him
in
the
bankruptcy
court
if
he
did
i
feel
easy
with
cheque
for
an
account
until
i
saw
how
the
clerk
took
it
across
the
bank
counter
you
mark
my
words
be
a
fire
in
that
establishment
before
the
the
prophecy
was
fulfilled
as
hyacinth
learnt
from
the
and
whole
stock
of
goods
was
consumed
there
were
rumours
that
a
sceptical
insurance
company
made
difficulties
about
paying
the
compensation
demanded
but
the
inhabitants
of
ardnaree
marked
their
confidence
in
the
husband
of
an
niece
by
presenting
him
with
an
address
of
sympathy
and
a
purse
containing
ten
sovereigns
most
of
business
was
done
with
small
shopkeepers
in
remote
districts
the
who
lived
out
of
reach
of
such
centres
of
fashion
as
ardnaree
and
clogher
were
sufficiently
unsophisticated
to
prefer
things
which
were
really
good
hats
and
bonnets
were
not
quite
universal
among
the
women
in
the
mountain
districts
far
back
where
they
spoke
irish
and
were
still
in
request
even
the
younger
women
wanted
garments
which
would
keep
them
warm
and
dry
and
hyacinth
often
returned
well
satisfied
from
a
tour
of
the
country
shops
sometimes
he
doubted
whether
he
ought
to
trust
the
people
with
more
than
a
few
worth
of
goods
but
he
gradually
learnt
that
unlike
the
patriotic
dowling
they
were
universally
honest
he
discovered
too
that
these
people
with
their
imperfect
english
and
little
knowledge
of
the
world
were
exceedingly
shrewd
they
had
very
little
real
confidence
in
oratorical
politicians
and
their
interest
in
public
affairs
went
no
further
than
voting
consistently
for
the
man
their
priest
recommended
but
they
quickly
understood
arguments
when
he
told
them
that
the
support
of
irish
manufactures
would
help
to
save
their
sons
and
daughters
from
the
curse
of
emigration
sir
said
a
shopkeeper
who
kept
a
few
blankets
and
tweeds
among
his
and
you
were
talking
to
the
boys
last
month
i
induce
one
of
them
to
take
the
foreign
stuff
if
i
was
to
offer
him
a
shilling
along
with
chapter
xvi
when
he
returned
to
ballymoy
after
his
interview
with
dowling
hyacinth
set
himself
to
fulfil
his
threat
of
writing
to
the
he
spent
saturday
afternoon
and
evening
in
his
lodgings
with
the
paper
containing
the
blatant
speech
spread
out
before
him
he
blew
his
anger
to
a
white
heat
by
going
over
the
evidence
of
the
grotesque
hypocrisy
he
wrote
and
rewrote
his
article
it
was
his
first
attempt
at
expressing
thought
on
paper
since
the
days
when
he
sought
to
satisfy
examiners
with
disquisitions
on
dramatic
talent
and
other
topics
suited
to
the
undergraduate
mind
this
was
a
different
business
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
filling
a
sheet
of
foolscap
with
grammatical
sentences
discovering
synonyms
for
words
hard
to
spell
now
thoughts
were
hot
in
him
and
the
art
lay
in
finding
words
which
would
blister
and
scorch
time
after
time
he
tore
up
a
page
of
bombast
or
erased
ridiculous
flamboyancies
late
at
night
with
a
burning
head
and
feet
he
made
his
last
copy
folded
it
up
and
distrusting
the
cooler
criticism
of
the
morning
went
out
and
posted
it
to
the
a
letter
from
miss
goold
overtook
him
the
following
thursday
in
the
hotel
at
clogher
was
delighted
to
hear
from
you
again
she
wrote
was
afraid
you
had
cut
me
altogether
gone
over
to
the
respectable
people
and
forgotten
poor
ireland
captain
quinn
told
me
that
you
and
he
had
quarrelled
and
i
gathered
that
you
rather
disapproved
of
him
well
he
was
a
bit
of
a
blackguard
but
after
all
one
expect
a
man
who
takes
on
a
job
of
that
kind
to
be
anything
else
i
never
thought
it
would
suit
you
and
you
will
do
me
the
justice
of
remembering
that
i
never
wanted
you
to
volunteer
now
about
your
article
it
was
admirable
these
it
was
thus
the
article
was
headed
just
the
creatures
we
want
to
scarify
dowling
and
his
kind
are
the
worst
enemies
ireland
has
publish
anything
of
that
kind
you
send
us
and
remember
not
the
least
afraid
of
anybody
a
grand
thing
for
a
paper
to
be
as
impecunious
as
the
no
man
but
a
fool
would
take
a
libel
action
against
us
with
any
hope
of
getting
damages
a
jury
might
value
character
at
any
fantastic
sum
they
chose
but
it
would
be
a
poor
penny
the
would
pay
still
not
so
hard
up
that
we
give
our
contributors
something
and
next
week
get
a
small
cheque
from
the
office
i
hope
it
may
encourage
you
to
send
us
more
be
afraid
to
speak
out
if
anything
peculiarly
seditious
occurs
to
you
write
it
in
irish
i
know
all
the
same
to
you
which
language
you
write
in
do
us
half
a
column
every
fortnight
or
so
on
western
life
and
hyacinth
was
absurdly
elated
by
miss
praise
he
made
up
his
mind
to
contribute
regularly
to
the
and
had
visions
of
a
great
future
as
a
journalist
or
perhaps
a
literary
exponent
of
the
ideas
of
independent
ireland
meanwhile
he
became
very
intimate
both
with
the
quinns
and
with
canon
family
quinn
was
an
enthusiastic
gardener
and
early
in
the
spring
hyacinth
helped
her
with
her
flowerbeds
he
learnt
to
plait
the
foliage
of
faded
crocuses
and
pin
them
tidily
to
the
ground
with
little
wooden
forks
he
gathered
suitable
earth
for
the
boxes
in
which
begonias
made
their
earliest
sproutings
and
learned
to
know
the
daffodils
and
tulips
by
their
names
later
on
he
helped
quinn
to
mow
the
grass
and
mix
a
potent
for
the
gravel
walks
there
came
to
be
an
understanding
that
whenever
he
was
not
absent
on
a
journey
he
spent
the
latter
part
of
the
afternoon
and
the
evening
with
the
quinns
as
the
days
lengthened
the
family
tea
was
pushed
back
to
later
and
later
hours
to
give
more
time
out
of
doors
there
is
something
about
the
very
occupation
of
gardening
which
is
deadening
to
enthusiasm
perhaps
a
man
learns
patience
by
familiarity
with
growing
plants
nature
is
never
in
a
hurry
in
a
garden
and
there
is
no
use
in
trying
to
hustle
a
flower
whereas
a
great
impatience
is
the
very
of
enthusiastic
patriotism
there
has
probably
never
been
a
revolutionary
gardener
or
even
a
strong
radical
who
worked
with
flowers
of
course
in
greenhouses
things
can
be
forced
and
the
spirit
of
the
ardent
reformer
may
find
expression
in
the
nurture
of
premature
blooms
perhaps
also
the
constant
stooping
which
gardening
necessitates
especially
in
the
early
spring
when
the
weeds
grow
plentifully
tends
to
destroy
the
stiff
mental
independence
which
must
be
the
attitude
of
the
militant
patriot
it
is
very
difficult
for
a
man
who
has
stooped
long
enough
to
have
conquered
his
early
cramps
and
aches
to
face
the
problems
of
politics
with
uncompromising
rigidity
hyacinth
recognised
with
a
curious
qualm
of
disgust
that
his
thoughts
turned
less
and
less
to
wrongs
and
future
as
he
learnt
to
care
for
the
flowers
and
the
grass
no
doubt
too
the
atmosphere
of
the
family
life
was
not
congenial
to
the
spirit
of
the
irish
politician
quinn
was
totally
uninterested
in
politics
and
except
a
prejudice
in
favour
of
what
she
called
loyalty
had
absolutely
no
views
on
any
question
which
did
not
directly
affect
her
home
and
her
children
quinn
had
a
political
and
economic
creed
which
acted
on
the
luxuriant
fancies
of
enthusiasm
as
his
did
on
the
tender
green
of
the
paths
he
declined
altogether
to
see
any
good
in
supporting
irish
manufactures
simply
because
they
were
irish
the
story
of
attitude
towards
his
shawls
moved
him
to
no
indignation
think
perfectly
right
he
said
a
man
can
buy
cheap
shawls
in
england
he
would
be
a
fool
to
pay
more
for
irish
ones
business
be
run
on
those
lines
not
an
object
of
charity
and
if
i
meet
fair
competition
i
must
go
under
and
right
that
i
should
go
hyacinth
had
no
answer
to
give
he
shirked
the
point
at
issue
and
attacked
quinn
along
another
line
in
the
hope
of
arousing
his
indignation
it
is
not
fair
competition
that
you
are
called
upon
to
face
do
you
call
it
fair
competition
when
the
government
subsidizes
a
woollen
factory
in
a
convent
said
quinn
are
thinking
of
the
four
thousand
pounds
the
congested
districts
board
gave
to
the
convent
at
bobeen
but
it
is
hardly
fair
to
hold
the
government
responsible
for
the
way
that
body
wastes
eighty
thousand
pounds
a
government
is
ultimately
responsible
and
you
must
admit
that
after
such
a
gift
and
in
view
of
the
others
which
will
certainly
follow
you
are
called
upon
to
meet
most
unfair
i
admit
that
but
that
exactly
what
you
want
to
make
general
there
seem
to
me
any
difference
between
giving
a
bounty
to
one
industry
and
imposing
a
protective
tariff
in
favour
of
another
and
if
your
preference
for
irish
manufactures
means
anything
it
means
a
sort
of
voluntary
protection
for
every
business
in
the
country
if
you
object
to
the
robeen
business
being
subsidized
you
logically
try
to
insist
on
mine
being
it
was
puzzling
to
have
the
tables
turned
on
him
so
adroitly
hyacinth
was
reduced
to
feeble
threat
wait
a
while
till
the
nuns
get
another
four
thousand
pounds
and
perhaps
four
thousand
pounds
more
after
that
and
see
how
it
will
affect
quinn
smiled
not
much
afraid
of
nuns
as
trade
competitors
or
for
the
matter
of
that
of
the
congested
districts
board
either
if
the
yorkshire
people
would
only
import
a
few
mother
superiors
to
manage
their
factories
and
take
the
advice
of
members
of
our
board
in
their
affairs
i
would
cheerfully
make
them
a
present
of
any
reasonable
subsidy
and
beat
them
out
of
the
market
there
was
another
influence
at
work
on
mind
which
had
as
much
to
do
with
the
decay
of
his
patriotism
as
either
the
gardening
or
logic
marion
beecher
and
her
sister
were
very
frequently
at
the
mill
house
during
the
spring
and
summer
there
was
one
long
afternoon
which
was
spent
in
the
marking
out
of
the
quinn
had
theories
involving
calculations
with
a
pencil
and
pieces
of
paper
about
the
surest
method
of
securing
right
angles
at
the
corners
and
parallel
lines
down
the
sides
of
the
court
hyacinth
and
marion
worked
obediently
with
a
tape
measure
and
the
garden
line
one
of
the
boys
messed
cheerfully
with
a
pail
of
liquid
whitening
afterwards
the
gardening
was
somewhat
deserted
and
hyacinth
was
instructed
in
the
game
it
took
him
a
long
time
to
learn
and
for
many
afternoons
he
and
marion
were
regularly
beaten
but
she
would
not
give
up
hope
of
him
often
the
excuse
of
her
coming
to
the
quinns
was
the
necessity
of
practising
some
new
hymn
or
chant
for
sunday
hyacinth
worked
as
hard
at
the
music
as
at
the
tennis
under
her
tuition
and
there
came
a
time
when
he
could
sing
an
easy
tenor
part
with
fair
accuracy
then
in
the
early
summer
when
the
evenings
were
warm
hymns
were
sung
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
there
seemed
no
incongruity
in
marion
company
in
passing
without
a
break
from
to
and
quinn
was
always
ready
to
do
his
best
at
the
bass
with
a
serious
simplicity
as
if
it
were
a
perfectly
natural
and
usual
thing
to
close
an
amusement
with
of
hyacinth
was
not
conscious
of
any
definite
change
in
his
attitude
towards
religion
he
still
believed
himself
to
be
somehow
outside
the
inner
shrine
of
the
life
which
the
beechers
and
the
quinns
lived
just
as
he
had
been
outside
his
prayers
but
he
found
it
increasingly
difficult
after
an
hour
or
two
of
companionship
with
marion
beecher
to
get
back
to
the
emotions
which
had
swayed
him
during
the
weeks
of
his
intimacy
with
miss
goold
to
write
for
the
after
sitting
beside
marion
in
church
on
sunday
evenings
was
like
passing
suddenly
from
a
quiet
wood
into
a
heated
saloon
where
people
wrangled
a
wave
of
the
old
passionate
feeling
when
it
returned
affected
him
as
raw
spirit
would
the
palate
of
a
boy
one
day
early
in
summer
the
short
summer
of
connaught
which
is
glorious
in
june
and
dissolves
into
windy
mist
and
warm
rain
in
the
middle
of
july
hyacinth
was
invited
by
canon
beecher
to
join
a
boating
party
on
the
lake
the
river
whose
one
useful
function
was
the
turning
of
millwheel
wound
away
afterwards
through
marshy
fields
and
groves
of
into
the
great
lake
at
its
mouth
the
beechers
kept
their
boat
a
cumbrous
craft
very
heavy
to
row
but
safe
and
suited
to
carry
a
family
in
comfort
the
party
started
early
canon
beecher
hyacinth
and
one
of
the
boys
very
early
for
they
had
to
walk
the
two
miles
which
separated
ballymoy
from
the
lake
shore
beecher
the
girls
the
two
other
boys
and
the
baskets
of
provisions
followed
a
little
later
on
the
rectory
car
packed
beyond
all
possibility
of
comfort
the
canon
himself
pulled
an
oar
untiringly
but
without
the
faintest
semblance
of
style
and
the
party
rippled
with
joy
when
they
discovered
that
hyacinth
also
could
row
said
elsie
can
go
anywhere
we
can
go
on
rowing
and
rowing
all
day
and
see
places
never
seen
dear
girl
said
her
mother
that
conneally
and
your
father
machines
you
expect
them
to
go
too
but
said
elsie
says
he
never
gets
tired
if
he
has
only
one
oar
to
the
canon
was
preparing
for
his
toil
the
old
coat
in
colour
now
almost
olive
green
was
folded
and
used
as
a
cushion
by
marion
in
the
bow
his
white
cuffs
stowed
inside
his
hat
were
committed
to
the
care
of
beecher
he
rolled
his
gray
shirtsleeves
up
to
the
elbow
and
unbuttoned
his
waistcoat
he
said
ready
if
not
hurried
pull
along
all
day
but
what
about
you
conneally
not
accustomed
to
this
sort
of
thing
but
hyacinth
for
once
was
he
might
be
a
poor
singer
and
a
contemptible
tennis
player
but
he
knew
that
nothing
which
had
to
do
with
boats
could
come
amiss
to
him
he
looked
across
the
sparkling
water
of
the
lake
go
on
as
long
as
you
like
you
tire
me
when
no
tide
and
no
waves
this
is
a
very
different
business
from
getting
out
the
sweeps
to
pull
a
nobby
five
miles
against
the
strength
of
the
ebb
with
a
heavy
ground
swell
about
eleven
they
landed
on
an
island
and
ate
biscuits
the
canon
told
hyacinth
the
story
of
the
ruin
under
whose
walls
they
sat
belonged
to
the
lynotts
the
welshmen
of
tyrawley
they
were
at
feud
with
the
burkes
and
one
night
in
winter
the
girls
wandered
away
carrying
their
biscuits
with
them
it
is
likely
that
they
had
heard
the
story
every
summer
as
long
as
they
could
remember
beecher
alone
still
maintained
an
attitude
of
admiration
for
her
antiquarian
knowledge
the
more
creditable
because
she
must
have
been
familiar
with
the
onset
of
the
macwilliam
burkes
before
even
marion
was
old
enough
to
listen
to
hyacinth
the
story
was
both
new
and
interesting
it
stirred
him
to
think
of
the
lynotts
fighting
hopelessly
or
begging
mercy
in
the
darkness
and
the
cold
just
where
he
sat
now
saturate
with
sunlight
and
with
life
he
gazed
across
the
mile
of
shining
water
which
separated
the
castle
from
the
land
and
tried
to
realize
how
the
irish
swam
from
the
island
with
an
infant
lynott
on
her
back
and
saved
the
name
from
perishing
how
the
snow
must
have
beaten
in
her
face
and
the
choked
her
breath
it
was
a
great
story
but
the
girls
shouting
from
the
edge
reminded
him
that
he
was
out
to
pull
an
oar
and
not
to
sentimentalize
he
and
the
canon
rose
half
smiling
half
sighing
and
took
their
places
in
the
boat
they
penetrated
before
luncheon
time
to
a
bay
hitherto
unknown
to
the
beechers
a
chorus
of
delight
greeted
its
discovery
the
water
shone
bright
green
and
very
clear
above
the
slabs
of
white
limestone
the
shore
far
inland
was
almost
broad
flat
rocks
lay
baking
in
the
sunshine
and
only
the
scantiest
grass
struggled
up
between
their
edges
sometimes
they
overlapped
each
other
and
rose
like
an
immense
staircase
fifty
yards
or
so
from
the
land
was
a
tiny
island
entirely
overgrown
with
stunted
bushes
the
boat
was
pushed
up
to
it
and
a
sought
but
the
shrubs
were
too
thick
and
it
was
decided
to
picnic
among
the
rocks
on
the
land
then
marion
in
the
bow
made
a
discovery
a
causeway
about
a
foot
under
water
led
from
the
island
to
the
shore
the
whole
party
leaned
over
to
examine
it
every
stone
was
visible
in
the
clear
water
and
it
was
obvious
that
it
had
been
planned
and
built
and
was
no
merely
accidental
formation
of
the
rocks
the
canon
had
heard
of
a
similar
device
resorted
to
by
an
island
hermit
to
insure
the
privacy
of
his
cell
hyacinth
spoke
vaguely
of
the
settlements
of
primitive
communities
of
the
three
boys
planned
an
expedition
across
the
causeway
after
luncheon
carry
our
shoes
and
stockings
with
us
they
said
then
explore
the
island
perhaps
there
is
a
hermit
there
still
or
a
primitive
what
is
a
primitive
conneally
hyacinth
was
uncertain
but
hazarded
a
suggestion
that
the
were
the
people
who
buried
each
other
in
raths
the
canon
whose
archaeology
did
not
go
back
beyond
patrick
offered
no
correction
tea
was
made
later
on
in
yet
another
bay
this
time
on
the
eastern
shore
of
the
lake
an
oak
wood
grew
down
almost
to
the
edge
and
the
branches
overhung
a
sandy
beach
more
golden
than
any
the
whole
party
collected
dead
wood
and
broken
twigs
for
the
fire
then
while
the
girls
unpacked
the
baskets
and
secured
the
kettle
amidst
the
smoke
hyacinth
lay
back
luxuriously
and
watched
the
sun
set
behind
the
mountain
opposite
the
long
steep
slope
shone
bright
green
while
the
sun
still
rested
in
view
above
the
summit
then
suddenly
when
the
topmost
rim
of
it
had
dipped
out
of
sight
the
whole
mountainside
turned
purple
and
a
glory
of
gold
and
crimson
hung
above
it
on
the
motionless
streaks
of
cloud
slowly
the
splendour
faded
the
purple
turned
gray
and
a
faint
breeze
fluttered
across
the
lake
the
day
was
the
first
of
many
which
hyacinth
gave
to
such
expeditions
the
work
of
office
was
not
so
pressing
as
to
necessitate
his
spending
every
day
there
when
he
was
in
ballymoy
and
a
holiday
was
always
obtainable
the
lake
scenery
remained
vivid
in
his
memory
in
and
had
its
influence
upon
him
even
while
he
enjoyed
it
unconscious
of
anything
except
the
present
pleasure
there
was
something
besides
the
innocent
gaiety
of
the
girls
and
the
simple
sincerity
of
the
platitudes
something
about
the
lake
itself
which
removed
him
to
a
spiritual
region
utterly
remote
from
the
fiery
atmosphere
of
miss
patriotism
many
things
which
once
loomed
very
large
before
him
sank
to
insignificance
as
he
drank
to
the
full
of
the
desolation
around
him
the
past
in
which
no
doubt
men
strove
and
hoped
hated
and
loved
and
feared
had
left
the
just
recognisable
ruins
of
some
castles
and
the
causeway
built
by
an
unknown
hermit
or
the
prehistoric
a
few
thatched
cabins
faintly
smoking
and
here
and
there
a
cairn
of
stones
gathered
laboriously
off
the
wretched
fields
were
the
evidences
of
present
activity
now
and
then
a
man
hooted
to
his
dog
as
it
barked
at
the
sheep
on
the
hillside
or
a
girl
drove
a
donkey
inland
from
the
boggy
shore
otherwise
there
were
no
signs
of
human
life
a
deep
sense
of
monotony
and
inevitableness
settled
down
upon
hyacinth
he
came
for
the
first
time
under
the
great
enchantment
which
paralyzes
the
spirit
and
energy
of
the
celt
he
knew
himself
to
be
as
his
people
were
capable
of
spasms
of
enthusiasm
the
victim
of
transitory
burnings
of
soul
but
the
curse
was
upon
him
the
inevitable
curse
of
feeling
too
keenly
and
seeing
too
clearly
to
be
strenuous
and
constant
the
flame
would
die
down
the
enthusiasm
would
vanish
it
was
vanishing
from
him
as
he
knew
well
and
leave
him
not
indeed
content
with
common
life
but
patient
of
it
and
to
the
very
end
sad
with
the
sense
of
possibilities
unrealized
yet
it
was
not
without
many
struggles
and
periods
of
return
to
the
older
emotions
that
hyacinth
surrendered
his
enthusiasm
there
still
recurred
to
him
memories
of
his
vision
of
an
armageddon
and
the
conception
of
his
own
part
in
it
sometimes
waking
very
early
in
the
morning
he
became
vividly
conscious
of
his
own
feebleness
of
will
and
his
falling
away
from
great
purposes
the
conviction
that
he
was
called
to
struggle
for
welfare
to
sacrifice
if
necessary
his
life
and
happiness
for
ireland
was
strong
in
him
still
he
felt
himself
affected
profoundly
by
the
influences
which
surrounded
him
but
he
had
not
ceased
to
believe
that
the
idea
of
labour
was
for
him
a
high
vocation
he
writhed
his
limbs
twisting
involuntarily
when
these
thoughts
beset
him
and
often
he
was
surprised
to
discover
that
he
was
actually
uttering
aloud
words
of
then
he
would
write
fiercely
brutally
catch
at
the
excuse
of
some
hypocrisy
or
corruption
or
else
denounce
selfishness
and
patriotic
sentiment
finding
subject
for
his
satire
in
himself
his
articles
brought
him
letters
of
praise
from
miss
goold
have
it
she
wrote
once
thing
we
all
seek
for
the
power
of
beating
thought
into
write
more
like
the
but
the
praise
always
came
late
the
violent
mood
the
the
bitterness
were
past
his
life
was
wrapt
round
again
with
softer
influences
and
he
read
his
own
words
with
shame
when
they
reached
him
in
print
afterwards
for
a
while
if
he
wrote
at
all
it
was
of
the
peasant
life
of
quaint
customs
legends
and
folklore
these
articles
appeared
too
but
brought
no
praise
from
miss
goold
once
she
reproached
him
when
he
lapsed
into
gentleness
for
many
consecutive
weeks
to
waste
yourself
there
are
fifty
men
and
women
can
do
the
sort
of
thing
doing
now
we
want
you
to
take
it
up
fighting
men
we
need
not
maundering
chapter
xvii
it
was
during
the
second
year
of
residence
in
ballymoy
that
the
at
clogher
died
the
poor
man
caught
a
cold
one
february
night
while
waiting
for
a
train
which
had
broken
down
three
miles
outside
his
station
from
the
cold
came
first
pneumonia
and
then
the
end
now
far
to
the
east
of
clogher
on
a
different
branch
of
the
is
a
town
with
which
the
people
of
mayo
have
no
connection
whatever
in
it
is
a
very
flourishing
masonic
lodge
almost
every
male
protestant
in
the
town
and
the
neighbourhood
belongs
to
it
and
the
rector
of
the
parish
is
its
chaplain
among
its
members
at
that
time
was
an
intelligent
young
man
who
occupied
the
position
of
goods
clerk
on
the
railway
the
masonic
brethren
as
in
duty
bound
used
their
influence
to
secure
his
promotion
and
brought
considerable
pressure
to
bear
on
the
directors
of
the
company
to
have
him
made
at
clogher
it
is
said
with
some
appearance
of
truth
that
no
appointment
in
ireland
is
ever
made
on
account
of
the
fitness
of
the
candidate
for
the
post
to
be
filled
whether
the
lord
lieutenant
has
to
nominate
a
local
government
board
inspector
or
an
urban
council
has
to
select
a
street
scavenger
the
principle
acted
on
is
the
same
no
investigation
is
made
about
the
ability
or
character
of
a
candidate
questions
may
be
asked
about
his
political
opinions
his
religious
creed
and
sometimes
about
the
social
position
of
his
wife
but
no
one
cares
in
the
least
about
his
ability
the
matter
really
turns
upon
the
amount
of
influence
which
he
can
bring
to
bear
so
it
happened
that
john
crawford
freemason
and
protestant
was
appointed
at
clogher
of
course
nobody
really
cared
who
got
the
post
except
a
few
seniors
of
john
who
wanted
it
for
themselves
probably
even
they
would
have
stopped
grumbling
after
a
month
or
two
if
it
had
not
happened
that
a
leading
weekly
newspaper
then
at
the
height
of
its
popularity
and
influence
was
just
inaugurating
a
crusade
against
protestants
and
freemasons
the
case
of
john
crawford
became
the
subject
of
a
series
of
bitter
and
vehement
articles
it
was
pointed
out
that
although
roman
catholics
were
beyond
all
question
more
intelligent
better
educated
and
more
upright
than
protestants
they
were
condemned
by
the
intolerance
of
officials
to
remain
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
it
was
shown
by
figures
which
admitted
of
no
controversy
that
irish
railways
banks
and
trading
companies
were
without
exception
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
entirely
owing
to
the
apathy
of
shareholders
who
allowed
their
interests
to
be
sacrificed
to
the
bigotry
of
directors
it
was
urged
that
a
public
meeting
should
be
held
at
clogher
to
protest
against
the
new
appointment
the
meeting
was
convened
and
father
fahey
consented
to
occupy
the
chair
he
was
supported
by
a
dispensary
doctor
anxious
to
propitiate
the
board
of
guardians
with
a
view
to
obtaining
a
summer
holiday
a
leading
publican
who
had
a
son
at
maynooth
a
grazier
who
dreaded
the
possible
partition
of
his
ranch
by
the
congested
districts
board
and
who
saw
a
hope
of
drawing
custom
from
the
counter
of
his
rival
draper
the
scotchman
father
fahey
opened
the
proceedings
with
a
speech
he
assured
his
audience
that
he
was
not
actuated
by
any
spirit
of
religious
bigotry
or
intolerance
he
wished
well
to
his
protestant
and
hoped
that
in
the
bright
future
which
lay
before
ireland
men
of
all
creeds
would
be
united
in
working
for
the
common
good
of
their
country
these
sentiments
were
not
received
with
vociferous
applause
the
audience
was
perfectly
well
aware
that
something
much
more
to
the
point
was
coming
and
reserved
their
cheers
father
fahey
did
not
disappoint
them
he
proceeded
to
show
that
the
appointment
of
the
new
was
a
deliberate
insult
to
the
faith
of
the
inhabitants
of
clogher
we
he
asked
submit
tamely
to
having
the
worst
evils
of
the
old
ascendancy
revived
in
our
midst
he
was
followed
by
the
dispensary
doctor
who
also
began
by
declaring
his
freedom
from
bigotry
he
confused
the
issue
slightly
by
complaining
that
the
new
was
entirely
ignorant
of
the
irish
language
it
was
perfectly
well
known
that
in
private
life
the
doctor
was
in
the
habit
of
expressing
the
greatest
contempt
for
the
gaelic
league
and
that
he
could
not
if
his
life
depended
on
it
have
translated
even
advertisements
but
his
speech
was
greeted
with
tumultuous
cheers
he
proceeded
to
harrow
the
feelings
of
his
audience
by
describing
what
he
had
heard
at
the
one
evening
while
waiting
for
the
train
as
he
paced
the
platform
his
attention
was
attracted
by
the
sound
of
a
piano
in
the
house
he
listened
and
to
his
amazement
and
disgust
heard
the
tune
of
a
popular
song
he
brought
down
his
fist
on
the
table
as
he
uttered
the
awful
indictment
from
ask
he
went
on
ask
our
venerated
and
beloved
parish
priest
i
ask
you
fathers
of
innocent
families
i
ask
every
patriot
in
this
room
are
our
ears
to
be
insulted
our
morals
corrupted
our
intellects
depraved
by
sounds
like
these
he
closed
his
speech
by
proposing
a
resolution
requiring
the
railway
company
to
withdraw
the
obnoxious
official
from
their
midst
the
oratory
of
the
grazier
who
seconded
the
resolution
was
not
inferior
it
filled
his
heart
with
a
sense
of
shame
so
he
said
to
think
of
his
cattle
poor
innocent
beasts
of
the
field
being
handled
by
a
protestant
they
had
been
bred
these
bullocks
of
his
by
catholics
fed
by
catholics
were
owned
by
a
catholic
bought
with
catholic
money
at
the
fairs
and
yet
they
were
told
that
in
all
ireland
no
catholic
could
be
discovered
fit
to
put
them
into
a
train
neither
the
resolution
itself
nor
the
appeal
of
the
grazier
produced
the
slightest
effect
on
the
railway
company
john
crawford
continued
to
sell
tickets
even
to
father
fahey
himself
and
appeared
entirely
unconcerned
by
the
fuss
about
a
fortnight
after
the
meeting
hyacinth
spent
a
night
in
clogher
holywell
the
cigarette
man
happened
to
be
in
the
hotel
and
as
usual
got
through
a
good
deal
of
desultory
conversation
while
he
drank
his
quite
unexpectedly
and
apropos
of
nothing
that
had
been
said
he
plumped
out
the
question
religion
are
you
conneally
the
inquiry
was
such
an
unusual
one
and
came
so
strangely
from
holywell
who
had
always
seemed
a
gallio
in
matters
spiritual
that
hyacinth
hesitated
a
baptist
myself
he
went
on
apparently
with
a
view
to
palliating
his
inquisitiveness
by
a
show
of
candour
find
it
a
very
convenient
sort
of
religion
in
connaught
there
a
single
place
of
worship
belonging
to
my
denomination
in
the
whole
province
so
always
able
to
get
my
sundays
to
myself
i
want
to
convert
you
to
anything
or
to
argue
with
you
but
i
have
a
fancy
that
you
are
a
church
of
ireland
hyacinth
admitted
the
correctness
of
the
guess
and
wondered
what
was
coming
next
spend
a
sunday
here
said
hyacinth
always
get
back
home
for
the
end
of
the
week
if
i
well
do
you
know
if
i
were
you
i
should
spend
next
sunday
here
and
go
to
shall
not
do
anything
of
the
your
own
affair
of
course
only
i
just
think
i
should
do
it
if
i
were
you
a
minute
said
hyacinth
want
to
know
what
you
holywell
sat
down
again
heavily
round
your
customers
here
lately
i
only
arrived
this
evening
and
have
done
nothing
yet
i
mean
to
go
round
them
may
just
as
well
go
home
by
the
early
train
for
all
the
good
hyacinth
restrained
himself
with
an
effort
he
reflected
that
he
was
more
likely
to
get
at
the
meaning
of
these
mysterious
warnings
if
he
refrained
from
direct
questioning
after
a
minute
of
two
of
silence
hollywell
went
on
had
a
meeting
here
a
little
while
ago
about
the
appointment
of
a
protestant
they
take
much
by
it
so
far
as
the
railway
company
is
concerned
but
i
happen
to
know
that
word
has
gone
round
that
every
shopkeeper
in
the
town
is
to
order
his
goods
as
far
as
possible
from
catholics
now
everybody
knows
your
boss
is
a
protestant
but
the
people
are
a
little
uncertain
about
you
never
seen
you
at
mass
which
is
suspicious
but
on
the
other
hand
the
way
you
gas
on
about
irish
manufactures
makes
them
think
you
be
a
protestant
the
proper
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
lie
low
till
put
in
an
appearance
at
mass
and
then
go
round
and
try
for
the
kind
of
thing
said
hyacinth
i
do
if
i
had
no
religion
at
all
but
it
happens
that
i
have
convictions
of
a
sort
and
i
mean
to
go
against
well
as
i
said
before
your
own
affair
only
better
protestants
than
you
have
done
as
much
why
i
do
it
myself
constantly
and
everyone
knows
that
a
baptist
is
the
strongest
kind
of
protestant
there
this
reasoning
curiously
enough
proved
unconvincing
believe
said
hyacinth
a
religious
boycott
of
the
kind
is
possible
people
be
such
fools
as
to
act
clean
against
their
own
interests
considering
that
of
the
drapery
goods
in
the
country
come
from
england
and
are
sold
by
protestant
travellers
i
see
how
the
shopkeepers
could
act
as
you
of
course
they
act
against
their
own
interests
never
come
across
a
religion
yet
that
made
men
do
that
they
attempt
to
boycott
the
english
firms
because
as
you
say
they
but
they
can
boycott
you
everything
your
boss
makes
is
turned
out
just
as
well
and
just
as
cheap
or
cheaper
by
the
nuns
at
robeen
perhaps
you
know
that
these
holy
ladies
have
hired
a
traveller
well
they
have
and
a
middling
smart
man
too
quite
smart
enough
to
play
the
trumps
that
are
put
into
his
hand
and
got
a
fine
flush
of
them
now
what
with
the
way
that
wretched
rag
of
a
paper
which
started
all
the
fuss
goes
on
rampaging
and
the
amount
of
feeling
got
up
over
the
the
peaceablest
people
in
the
place
would
be
afraid
to
deal
with
a
protestant
at
the
present
moment
the
robeen
man
has
the
game
in
his
own
hands
and
bound
to
say
be
a
fool
if
he
play
it
for
all
worth
do
it
myself
if
i
was
in
his
hyacinth
discovered
next
day
that
holywell
had
summed
up
the
situation
very
accurately
no
questions
were
asked
about
his
religion
but
he
could
by
no
means
persuade
his
customers
to
give
him
even
a
small
order
every
was
filled
with
goods
placarded
ostentatiously
as
in
every
counter
had
tweeds
blankets
and
flannels
from
the
same
factory
no
one
was
in
the
least
uncivil
to
him
and
no
one
assigned
any
plausible
reason
for
refusing
to
deal
with
him
he
was
simply
bowed
out
as
quickly
as
possible
from
every
shop
he
entered
he
returned
home
disgusted
and
irritated
and
told
his
tale
to
his
employer
quinn
recognised
the
danger
that
threatened
him
for
the
first
time
he
admitted
that
his
business
was
being
seriously
injured
by
the
competition
of
robeen
he
took
hyacinth
into
his
confidence
more
fully
than
he
had
ever
done
before
and
explained
what
seemed
to
be
a
hopeful
plan
may
tell
you
conneally
that
i
have
very
little
capital
to
fall
back
upon
in
my
business
years
ago
when
things
were
better
than
they
are
now
i
had
a
few
thousands
put
by
but
most
of
it
went
on
buying
my
brother
share
of
the
mill
lately
i
have
not
been
able
to
save
and
at
the
present
moment
i
can
lay
hands
on
very
little
money
still
i
have
something
and
what
i
mean
to
do
is
this
i
shall
give
up
all
idea
of
making
a
profit
for
the
present
i
shall
even
sell
my
goods
at
a
slight
loss
and
try
to
beat
the
nunnery
out
of
the
market
i
think
this
religious
animosity
will
weaken
after
a
while
and
if
we
offer
the
cheapest
goods
we
must
in
the
end
get
back
our
hyacinth
was
not
so
sanguine
forget
he
said
these
people
have
government
money
at
their
backs
and
are
likely
to
get
more
of
it
if
you
sell
at
a
loss
they
will
do
so
too
and
ask
for
a
new
grant
from
the
congested
districts
board
to
make
good
their
quinn
sighed
is
quite
possible
he
said
what
can
i
do
i
must
make
a
fight
for
my
hyacinth
hesitated
i
have
no
right
to
make
the
suggestion
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
bound
to
be
beaten
would
it
not
be
better
to
give
in
at
once
risk
the
money
you
have
safe
keep
it
and
try
to
sell
the
mill
and
the
shall
hold
on
said
quinn
you
not
to
think
of
your
wife
remember
what
it
will
mean
to
her
if
you
are
beaten
in
the
end
when
your
savings
are
gone
and
your
business
for
a
moment
there
were
signs
of
wavering
in
face
the
fingers
of
his
hands
twisted
in
and
out
of
each
other
and
a
pitiable
look
of
great
distress
came
into
his
eyes
then
he
unclasped
his
hands
and
placed
them
flat
on
the
table
before
him
shall
hold
on
he
said
shall
not
close
my
mill
while
i
have
a
shilling
left
to
pay
my
workers
said
hyacinth
is
for
you
to
decide
at
least
you
can
count
on
my
doing
my
best
my
very
chapter
xviii
quinn
carried
on
his
struggle
for
nearly
a
year
although
from
the
very
first
he
might
have
recognised
its
hopelessness
time
after
time
hyacinth
made
his
tour
and
visited
the
shopkeepers
who
had
once
been
his
customers
occasionally
he
succeeded
in
obtaining
orders
and
a
faint
gleam
of
hope
encouraged
him
but
he
had
no
steady
success
original
estimate
of
the
situation
was
so
far
justified
that
after
a
while
the
religious
animosity
died
out
shopkeepers
even
explained
apologetically
that
they
gave
their
orders
to
the
robeen
convent
for
purely
commercial
reasons
goods
are
cheaper
than
yours
and
the
truth
hyacinth
recognised
that
quinn
was
being
beaten
at
his
own
game
he
had
attempted
to
drive
the
nuns
out
of
the
market
by
underselling
them
and
now
it
appeared
that
they
too
were
prepared
to
face
a
loss
it
was
obvious
that
their
losses
must
be
great
much
greater
than
rumours
were
rife
of
large
loans
raised
by
the
mother
superior
of
mortgages
on
the
factory
buildings
and
the
machinery
these
stories
brought
very
little
consolation
for
as
hyacinth
knew
quinn
was
very
nearly
at
the
end
of
his
resources
he
refused
to
borrow
i
am
forced
to
close
up
he
said
shall
do
so
with
a
clear
i
have
no
wish
for
should
like
said
hyacinth
vindictively
see
the
reverend
mother
reduced
to
paying
a
shilling
in
the
am
afraid
said
quinn
see
that
the
convent
is
a
branch
of
an
immense
organization
no
doubt
if
it
comes
to
a
pinch
funds
will
be
and
they
draw
on
their
own
purse
till
they
have
got
all
they
can
out
of
the
congested
districts
board
i
have
no
doubt
they
are
counting
on
another
four
thousand
pounds
to
start
them
clear
when
they
have
beaten
one
day
quite
accidentally
hyacinth
came
by
a
piece
of
information
about
the
working
of
the
robeen
factory
which
startled
him
he
was
travelling
home
by
rail
it
happened
to
be
friday
and
as
usual
in
the
early
summer
the
train
was
crowded
with
emigrants
on
their
way
to
queenstown
the
familiar
melancholy
crowd
waited
on
every
platform
old
women
weeping
openly
and
men
with
faces
ridiculously
screwed
and
puckered
in
the
effort
to
restrain
the
rising
tears
clung
to
their
sons
and
daughters
pitiful
little
boxes
and
carpet
bags
were
piled
on
the
platform
friends
clung
to
hands
outstretched
through
the
while
the
train
moved
slowly
out
then
came
the
long
mournful
wail
from
those
left
behind
and
the
last
wavings
of
farewell
at
the
robeen
station
the
crowd
was
no
less
than
elsewhere
the
carriages
set
apart
for
the
emigrants
were
full
and
at
the
last
minute
two
girls
were
hustled
into
the
compartment
where
hyacinth
sat
a
woman
their
mother
mumbled
and
slobbered
over
their
hands
an
old
man
too
old
to
be
their
father
shouted
broken
benedictions
to
them
two
young
men
lovers
perhaps
or
brothers
stood
desolate
and
helpless
without
speaking
after
the
train
had
started
hyacinth
looked
at
the
girls
one
of
them
a
pretty
creature
of
perhaps
eighteen
years
old
wept
quietly
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
beside
her
lay
her
carpet
bag
and
a
brown
shawl
on
her
lap
was
an
orange
and
she
held
a
crumpled
paper
bag
of
biscuits
in
her
hand
there
was
nothing
unusual
about
her
she
was
just
one
instance
of
heartbreak
the
of
a
whole
nation
which
loves
home
as
no
other
people
have
ever
loved
it
and
yet
are
doomed
as
it
seems
inevitably
to
leave
it
she
was
just
one
more
waif
thrown
into
the
whirlpool
of
the
great
world
to
toil
and
struggle
succeed
barrenly
or
pitifully
fail
but
through
it
all
through
even
the
possible
loss
of
faith
and
ultimate
degradation
fated
to
cling
to
a
love
for
the
gray
desolate
fatherland
the
other
girl
was
different
hyacinth
looked
at
her
with
intense
interest
she
was
the
older
of
the
two
and
not
so
pretty
as
her
sister
her
face
was
thin
and
pale
and
a
broad
scar
under
one
ear
showed
where
a
knife
had
cut
she
sat
with
her
hands
folded
on
her
lap
gazing
out
of
the
window
beside
her
there
was
no
sign
of
sorrow
on
her
face
nothing
but
a
kind
of
sulky
defiance
after
a
while
she
took
the
paper
bag
out
of
her
hand
opened
it
and
began
to
eat
the
gingerbread
biscuits
it
contained
hyacinth
spoke
to
her
but
she
turned
her
head
away
and
would
not
answer
him
his
voice
seemed
to
rouse
the
younger
sister
who
stopped
crying
and
looked
at
him
curiously
he
tried
again
and
this
time
he
spoke
in
irish
at
once
the
younger
girl
brightened
and
answered
him
apparently
she
had
no
fear
that
malice
could
lurk
in
the
heart
of
a
man
who
spoke
her
own
language
in
a
few
minutes
she
was
chatting
to
him
as
if
he
were
an
old
friend
he
learnt
that
the
two
girls
were
on
their
way
to
new
york
they
had
a
sister
there
who
had
sent
them
the
price
of
their
tickets
yes
the
sister
was
in
a
situation
was
getting
good
wages
and
had
clothes
grand
as
a
she
had
sent
home
a
photograph
at
which
their
mother
had
shown
all
round
the
parish
these
two
were
to
get
situations
also
as
soon
as
they
arrived
oh
yes
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
bridgy
had
promised
there
were
four
of
them
left
at
home
three
boys
and
a
girl
no
doubt
in
time
they
would
all
follow
bridgy
to
america
all
but
seumas
he
was
to
have
the
farm
no
the
girls
could
not
get
married
because
their
father
was
too
poor
to
give
them
fortunes
there
was
nothing
for
them
but
to
go
to
america
but
their
mother
had
not
wanted
them
to
go
the
clergy
and
the
nuns
were
against
the
girls
going
indeed
they
nearly
had
them
persuaded
to
send
money
back
onny
was
set
on
she
glanced
at
her
sister
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
hyacinth
turned
to
her
do
you
want
to
leave
ireland
but
onny
remained
silent
sulky
at
it
seemed
it
was
the
younger
girl
who
answered
him
say
a
fine
life
they
have
out
there
good
money
to
be
earned
and
we
be
coming
home
some
day
with
a
fortune
you
sorry
to
leave
ireland
again
he
looked
at
the
elder
girl
and
this
time
was
rewarded
with
a
flash
of
defiant
bitterness
from
her
eyes
is
it
no
but
glad
always
saying
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
earned
in
the
factory
and
she
got
more
than
the
rest
of
us
she
the
first
girl
that
sister
mary
aloysius
picked
out
of
the
school
when
the
young
lady
from
england
came
over
to
teach
us
she
was
the
best
worker
they
true
what
she
says
said
onny
was
the
best
worker
they
had
i
worked
for
them
for
three
years
and
all
i
was
getting
at
the
end
of
it
was
six
shillings
a
week
why
would
i
be
working
for
that
when
i
might
be
getting
wages
like
in
america
what
sense
would
there
be
in
it
why
did
you
work
for
such
wages
now
said
the
younger
girl
could
we
be
refusing
the
reverend
mother
when
she
came
round
the
town
herself
and
gave
warning
that
all
be
wanted
few
continued
onny
without
noticing
her
sister
earned
as
much
as
i
did
many
a
girl
works
there
and
has
no
more
than
one
and
ninepence
to
take
home
at
the
end
of
the
hyacinth
began
to
understand
how
it
was
that
quinn
was
being
hopelessly
beaten
this
was
no
struggle
between
two
trade
rivals
to
be
won
by
the
side
with
the
longer
purse
nor
was
it
simply
a
fight
between
an
independent
manufacturer
and
a
firm
fed
with
government
bounties
rival
could
count
on
an
unlimited
supply
of
labour
at
starvation
wages
while
he
had
to
hire
men
and
women
at
the
market
value
of
their
services
he
had
been
sorry
for
the
two
girls
when
they
got
into
the
train
now
he
felt
almost
glad
that
they
were
leaving
ireland
it
appeared
that
they
had
certainly
chosen
the
wiser
part
he
arrived
at
home
dejected
and
sat
down
beside
the
fire
in
his
room
to
give
himself
up
to
complete
despair
he
found
no
hope
anywhere
irish
patriotism
so
he
saw
it
was
a
matter
of
words
and
fine
phrases
no
one
really
believed
in
it
or
would
venture
anything
for
it
politics
was
a
game
at
which
sharpers
cheated
each
other
and
the
people
the
leaders
were
bold
only
in
sordid
personal
quarrels
the
mass
of
the
people
were
utterly
untouched
by
the
idea
of
nationality
in
earnest
about
nothing
but
huckstering
and
petty
gains
over
all
was
the
grip
of
a
foreign
bureaucracy
and
a
selfish
church
tightening
slowly
squeezing
out
the
life
grasping
and
holding
fast
its
wealth
no
man
any
longer
made
any
demand
except
to
be
allowed
to
earn
what
would
buy
whisky
enough
to
fuddle
him
into
temporary
forgetfulness
of
the
present
misery
and
the
imminent
tyranny
the
slatternly
who
brought
him
his
meals
and
made
his
bed
tapped
at
the
door
sir
jimmy
after
coming
with
a
letter
from
quinn
and
waiting
to
know
if
hyacinth
read
the
note
which
asked
him
to
call
on
his
employer
that
afternoon
him
be
you
have
your
dinner
before
you
go
the
chops
is
in
the
pan
below
or
will
i
keep
them
till
you
come
back
time
enough
bring
them
as
soon
as
cooked
and
for
sake
see
that
the
potatoes
are
properly
he
took
up
a
great
english
weekly
paper
with
copies
of
which
canon
beecher
supplied
him
at
irregular
intervals
and
propped
it
against
the
while
he
ate
the
article
which
caught
his
attention
was
headed
in
it
contained
an
idealized
account
of
the
work
of
the
robeen
nuns
from
whose
shoulders
it
seemed
to
the
writer
likely
that
wings
would
soon
sprout
there
was
a
description
of
the
once
miserable
cabins
now
transformed
into
homesteads
so
comfortable
that
english
labourers
would
not
disdain
them
the
people
shared
in
the
elevation
of
their
surroundings
men
and
women
lately
savages
starved
and
ignorant
had
risen
in
the
scale
of
civilization
and
intelligence
to
a
level
which
almost
equalled
that
of
a
hampshire
villager
the
double
stream
of
emigration
to
the
united
states
and
migration
to
the
english
was
stopped
an
earthly
paradise
had
been
created
in
a
howling
wilderness
by
the
labours
of
the
holy
ladies
aided
by
the
statesmanlike
liberality
of
the
congested
districts
board
there
was
another
page
of
the
article
but
hyacinth
could
stand
no
more
he
stood
up
and
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
already
nearly
five
he
pushed
his
way
down
the
street
where
the
having
completed
their
marketing
were
loading
donkeys
on
the
footpath
or
carts
pushed
backwards
against
the
kerbstone
women
dragged
their
husbands
from
the
and
girls
damp
and
bedraggled
stood
in
groups
waiting
for
their
parents
he
turned
into
the
gloomy
archway
of
the
mill
unlocked
the
iron
gate
and
crossed
the
yard
into
the
garden
the
lamp
burned
brightly
in
the
and
he
could
see
mrs
quinn
in
her
chair
by
the
fireside
sewing
her
children
sat
on
the
rug
at
her
feet
he
saw
their
faces
turned
up
to
hers
gravely
intent
no
doubt
she
was
telling
them
some
story
he
stood
for
a
minute
and
watched
them
while
the
peaceful
joy
of
the
scene
entered
into
his
heart
this
no
doubt
a
home
full
of
such
love
and
peace
was
the
best
thing
life
had
got
to
give
it
was
most
precious
benediction
thus
shall
a
man
be
blessed
who
feareth
the
he
turned
and
passed
on
to
the
door
the
servant
showed
him
in
not
as
he
expected
to
the
he
had
just
gazed
at
but
to
study
it
was
a
desolate
chamber
a
plain
wooden
desk
like
a
stood
in
one
corner
and
upon
it
a
feeble
lamp
a
bookcase
surmounted
a
row
of
cupboards
along
one
wall
its
contents
hyacinth
had
often
looked
over
them
were
a
encyclopaedia
of
england
of
martyrs
a
series
entitled
of
the
reformation
and
some
bound
volumes
of
a
trade
journal
above
the
chimneypiece
hung
two
a
and
an
old
gun
the
grate
was
fireless
it
was
a
room
obviously
not
loved
by
its
owner
neither
pleasure
nor
comfort
was
looked
for
in
it
it
was
simply
a
place
of
escape
from
the
attractions
of
quiet
ease
when
business
overflowed
the
proper
office
hours
quinn
rose
from
his
desk
when
hyacinth
entered
am
very
glad
to
see
you
he
said
want
to
have
a
talk
with
hyacinth
waited
while
he
arranged
and
rearranged
some
papers
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him
quinn
although
he
had
specially
sent
for
hyacinth
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
get
to
the
subject
of
the
interview
when
he
did
speak
it
was
evident
from
his
tone
that
the
important
topic
was
still
postponed
did
you
get
on
this
week
hyacinth
had
nothing
good
to
report
he
took
from
his
pocket
the
in
which
he
entered
his
orders
and
went
over
it
it
contained
an
attenuated
list
moreover
the
harvest
had
been
bad
and
old
debts
very
difficult
to
collect
quinn
listened
apparently
not
very
attentively
and
when
the
reading
was
over
said
you
report
this
week
is
simply
a
repetition
of
the
story
of
the
last
six
months
i
did
not
expect
it
to
be
different
it
makes
the
decision
i
have
to
make
a
little
more
inevitable
that
is
all
conneally
we
have
been
very
good
friends
and
since
you
have
been
in
my
employment
i
have
been
satisfied
with
you
in
every
way
now
i
am
unable
to
employ
you
any
longer
i
am
giving
up
my
hyacinth
made
an
effort
to
speak
but
quinn
held
up
his
hand
and
silenced
him
week
he
continued
received
news
which
settled
the
matter
for
me
jameson
and
thorpe
the
big
drapers
in
dublin
were
my
best
customers
for
certain
goods
last
monday
they
wrote
that
they
had
an
offer
of
blankets
at
a
figure
a
long
way
below
mine
i
believe
that
articles
equal
in
quality
to
mine
could
be
produced
at
the
price
and
wrote
a
hint
to
that
effect
i
received
nothing
could
have
been
more
courteous
a
sample
of
the
blankets
offered
well
i
admit
that
it
was
at
least
equal
to
what
i
could
supply
in
every
way
i
wrote
again
asking
as
a
favour
to
be
supplied
with
the
name
of
the
competing
firm
i
got
the
answer
thorpe
wrote
himself
the
robeen
convent
has
undersold
hyacinth
made
another
attempt
to
speak
me
finish
said
quinn
had
foreseen
of
course
that
this
was
coming
i
have
no
more
capital
to
fall
back
upon
i
do
not
mean
to
run
into
debt
there
is
nothing
for
me
but
to
dismiss
my
employées
and
shut
said
hyacinth
then
he
knew
he
had
no
right
to
ask
a
question
about
the
future
but
the
thought
of
quinn
and
her
children
as
he
had
seen
them
in
the
almost
forced
him
to
inquire
what
was
to
happen
to
them
a
spasm
of
extreme
pain
crossed
face
are
thinking
of
my
wife
it
will
be
hard
yes
very
hard
she
loved
this
place
her
friends
here
her
garden
and
all
the
quiet
peaceful
life
we
have
lived
well
there
is
to
be
an
end
of
it
but
look
so
he
forced
himself
to
smile
as
he
spoke
shall
not
starve
or
go
to
the
workhouse
i
have
a
knowledge
of
woollen
goods
if
i
have
nothing
else
and
i
dare
say
i
can
get
an
appointment
as
foreman
or
traveller
for
some
big
drapery
house
but
i
may
not
be
reduced
to
that
there
is
a
secretary
wanted
just
now
in
the
office
of
one
of
the
dublin
charitable
societies
i
mean
to
apply
for
the
post
canon
beecher
and
our
bishop
are
both
members
of
the
committee
and
i
am
sure
will
do
their
best
for
me
the
salary
is
not
princely
a
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
a
year
i
think
but
there
i
ought
not
to
be
talking
all
this
time
about
myself
i
must
try
and
do
something
for
mind
me
said
hyacinth
shall
be
all
right
but
i
bear
to
think
of
you
and
quinn
poverty
like
that
in
dublin
have
you
thought
what
it
means
a
shabby
little
house
in
a
crowded
street
off
at
the
back
of
somewhere
dirt
and
stuffiness
and
vulgarity
all
around
you
she
be
expected
to
stand
it
or
you
dear
boy
said
quinn
wife
and
i
have
been
trying
all
our
lives
to
be
christians
shall
we
receive
good
at
the
hand
and
not
evil
also
however
it
may
be
with
me
i
know
that
she
will
not
fail
in
the
his
face
lit
up
as
he
spoke
and
the
smile
on
it
was
no
longer
forced
but
clear
and
brave
hyacinth
knew
that
he
was
once
again
in
the
presence
of
that
mysterious
power
which
enables
men
and
women
to
meet
and
conquer
loss
and
pain
against
which
every
kind
of
misfortune
beats
in
vain
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
he
took
hand
and
bade
him
chapter
xix
hyacinth
had
three
work
to
do
before
he
actually
left
employment
he
knew
that
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
would
be
left
absolutely
without
income
and
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
look
out
for
some
other
situation
he
reckoned
up
the
remains
of
his
original
capital
and
found
himself
with
little
more
than
a
hundred
pounds
to
fall
back
upon
yet
he
did
nothing
from
time
to
time
he
bestirred
himself
pondered
the
newspaper
advertisements
of
vacant
situations
and
mentally
resolved
to
commence
his
search
at
once
always
some
excuse
offered
itself
to
justify
putting
the
unpleasant
business
off
and
he
allowed
himself
to
slip
back
into
the
quiet
routine
of
life
as
if
no
catastrophe
threatened
him
he
was
indeed
far
more
troubled
about
the
future
than
his
own
and
when
at
the
end
of
april
canon
beecher
returned
from
dublin
with
the
news
that
he
had
secured
the
secretaryship
of
the
church
of
ireland
scriptural
schools
society
for
quinn
hyacinth
felt
that
his
mind
was
relieved
of
a
great
anxiety
that
no
such
post
had
been
discovered
for
him
did
not
cost
him
a
thought
in
spite
of
his
spasmodic
efforts
to
goad
himself
into
a
condition
of
reasonable
anxiety
for
his
future
there
remained
half
consciously
present
in
his
mind
a
conviction
that
somehow
a
way
of
getting
sufficient
food
and
clothes
would
offer
itself
in
due
time
the
conviction
was
justified
by
the
event
it
was
on
saturday
evening
that
the
canon
returned
with
his
good
news
and
on
sunday
morning
hyacinth
received
a
letter
from
miss
goold
have
no
doubt
heard
she
wrote
we
have
got
a
new
editor
for
the
croppy
patrick
brother
of
course
you
remember
mary
and
her
unpoetical
hysterics
the
morning
after
the
rotunda
meeting
the
new
editor
is
a
splendid
man
he
has
been
on
the
staff
of
a
new
york
paper
for
the
last
five
years
and
thoroughly
understands
the
whole
business
but
not
the
best
of
him
he
hates
england
worse
than
i
do
only
a
child
beside
him
bursting
out
into
fits
of
temper
now
and
then
and
cooling
off
again
he
hates
steadily
quietly
and
intensely
but
even
that
is
not
all
that
is
to
be
said
he
has
got
brains
brains
enough
my
dear
hyacinth
to
make
fools
of
you
and
me
every
day
and
all
day
long
he
has
devised
a
new
policy
for
ireland
the
plan
is
simplicity
itself
like
all
really
great
plans
and
it
succeed
i
go
into
it
now
because
i
want
you
to
come
up
to
dublin
and
see
he
tells
me
that
he
needs
somebody
else
besides
himself
on
the
staff
of
the
which
by
the
way
is
to
be
enlarged
and
improved
he
wants
a
man
who
can
write
a
column
a
week
in
irish
as
well
as
an
article
now
and
then
in
good
strong
plain
english
i
suggested
your
name
to
him
and
showed
him
some
of
the
articles
you
had
written
he
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
one
about
cheap
patriotism
and
liked
one
or
two
of
the
others
he
just
asked
one
question
about
you
conneally
hate
england
and
the
empire
and
everything
english
from
the
parliament
to
the
police
barrack
it
is
this
hatred
which
must
animate
the
i
said
i
thought
you
did
i
told
him
how
you
had
volunteered
to
fight
for
the
boers
and
about
the
day
you
nearly
killed
that
blackguard
shea
he
seemed
to
think
that
was
good
enough
and
asked
me
to
write
to
you
on
the
subject
we
offer
you
a
big
salary
the
editor
himself
is
only
to
get
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
for
the
present
and
i
am
guaranteeing
another
hundred
for
you
i
am
confident
that
i
have
to
pay
it
for
more
than
six
months
the
paper
is
sure
to
go
as
it
never
went
before
and
in
a
few
years
we
shall
be
able
to
treble
salary
and
double
yours
nothing
like
such
a
chance
has
ever
offered
itself
in
irish
history
before
everything
goes
to
show
that
this
is
our
opportunity
england
is
weaker
than
she
has
been
for
centuries
is
clinging
desperately
to
the
last
tatters
of
her
old
prestige
she
a
single
statesman
capable
of
thinking
or
acting
vigorously
her
parliament
is
the
laughingstock
of
europe
her
irish
policy
may
be
summed
up
in
four
words
intrigue
with
the
vatican
in
ireland
the
power
of
the
faithful
garrison
is
gone
the
protestants
in
the
north
are
sick
of
being
fooled
by
one
english
party
after
another
the
landlords
or
left
of
them
are
beginning
to
discover
that
they
have
been
bought
and
sold
the
bishops
last
line
of
defence
are
overreaching
themselves
and
we
are
within
measurable
distance
of
the
day
when
the
church
will
be
put
into
her
proper
place
there
is
not
so
much
as
a
shoneen
publican
in
a
country
town
left
who
believes
in
the
ranting
of
and
his
litter
of
blind
whelps
ireland
is
simply
crying
out
for
light
and
leading
and
the
is
going
to
give
both
you
always
wanted
to
serve
ireland
now
i
am
offering
you
the
chance
i
say
you
ought
to
thank
me
though
you
will
thank
me
to
the
day
of
your
death
i
say
that
you
have
an
opportunity
of
becoming
a
great
man
i
know
you
and
i
know
a
better
way
of
making
sure
of
you
than
that
i
say
to
you
hyacinth
conneally
that
we
want
you
just
and
nobody
else
ireland
wants
the
letter
especially
the
last
part
of
it
was
sufficiently
ridiculous
to
have
moved
hyacinth
to
a
smile
but
it
did
no
such
thing
on
the
contrary
its
rhetoric
excited
and
touched
him
the
flattery
of
the
final
sentences
elated
him
the
absurdity
of
the
idea
that
ireland
needed
him
a
office
clerk
an
commercial
traveller
who
had
failed
to
sell
blankets
and
flannels
did
not
strike
him
at
all
the
figure
of
augusta
goold
rose
to
his
mind
she
flashed
before
him
an
apocalyptic
angel
splended
and
terrible
him
to
the
last
great
fight
he
forgot
in
an
instant
the
quinns
and
their
trouble
the
years
of
quietness
in
ballymoy
the
daily
intercourse
with
gentle
people
the
atmosphere
of
the
religion
in
which
he
had
lived
fell
away
from
him
suddenly
he
sat
absorbed
in
an
ecstasy
of
joyful
excitement
until
the
jangling
of
canon
church
bell
recalled
him
to
common
life
again
it
speaks
for
the
strength
of
the
habits
he
had
formed
in
ballymoy
that
he
rose
without
hesitation
and
went
to
take
his
part
in
the
morning
service
he
sat
down
as
usual
beside
marion
beecher
and
her
harmonium
he
listened
to
her
playing
until
her
father
entered
he
found
himself
gazing
at
her
when
she
stood
up
for
the
opening
words
of
the
service
he
felt
himself
strangely
affected
by
the
gentleness
of
her
face
and
the
slender
beauty
of
her
form
when
she
knelt
down
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
her
there
came
over
him
an
inexplicable
softening
a
relaxation
of
the
tense
excitement
of
the
morning
he
thought
of
her
kneeling
there
in
the
faded
shabby
church
sunday
after
sunday
for
years
and
years
when
he
was
working
at
hot
pressure
far
away
he
knew
just
how
her
eyes
would
look
calmly
trustfully
up
to
the
god
she
spoke
to
how
her
soul
would
grow
in
gentleness
how
love
would
be
the
very
atmosphere
around
her
and
all
the
while
he
would
struggle
and
fight
with
no
inspiration
except
a
bitter
hate
suddenly
there
came
on
him
a
feeling
that
he
could
not
leave
her
the
very
thought
of
separation
was
a
fierce
pain
a
desire
of
her
seized
on
him
like
uncontrollable
physical
hunger
wherever
he
might
be
whatever
life
might
have
in
store
for
him
he
knew
that
his
heart
would
go
back
to
her
restlessly
and
remain
unsatisfied
without
her
he
understood
that
he
loved
her
canon
voice
came
to
him
as
if
from
an
immense
distance
god
make
speed
to
save
then
he
heard
very
clearly
sweet
voice
replying
lord
make
haste
to
help
there
was
a
faint
shuffling
and
the
congregation
rose
to
their
feet
his
eyes
were
still
on
marion
and
now
his
whole
body
quivered
with
the
force
of
his
love
she
half
turned
and
looked
at
him
for
one
instant
their
eyes
met
and
he
saw
in
hers
a
flash
of
recognition
then
a
strange
look
of
fear
and
she
turned
away
from
him
flushed
and
trembling
he
saw
that
she
had
read
his
heart
and
knew
his
love
be
to
the
father
and
to
the
son
and
to
the
holy
ghost
read
the
canon
heavily
heart
swelled
in
him
his
whole
being
seemed
to
throb
with
exultation
and
he
responded
in
a
voice
he
could
not
recognise
for
his
it
was
in
the
beginning
is
now
and
ever
shall
be
world
without
end
marion
stood
silent
her
head
was
bowed
down
and
her
hands
clasped
tight
together
of
the
remainder
of
the
service
hyacinth
could
never
afterwards
remember
anything
no
doubt
canon
beecher
read
the
psalms
and
lessons
and
prayers
no
doubt
he
preached
probably
also
hymns
were
sung
and
marion
played
them
but
he
could
not
imagine
how
it
seemed
quite
impossible
that
she
could
have
touched
the
keys
with
her
fingers
or
that
she
could
have
uttered
any
sound
yet
no
one
had
remarked
the
absence
of
hymns
or
even
noticed
any
peculiarity
in
their
performance
not
till
after
the
service
was
over
did
he
regain
full
consciousness
of
himself
and
his
surroundings
then
he
became
exceedingly
alert
he
watched
the
canon
disappear
into
the
vestry
heard
the
congregation
trample
down
the
aisle
listened
to
marion
playing
a
final
voluntary
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
sat
there
waiting
for
her
to
stop
that
she
played
much
longer
than
usual
he
could
hear
beecher
and
quinn
talking
in
the
porch
and
every
moment
he
expected
the
canon
to
appear
at
last
the
music
ceased
and
the
lid
of
the
harmonium
was
closed
and
locked
he
stepped
forward
and
took
hands
in
his
he
said
love
you
it
was
only
this
morning
that
i
found
it
out
but
i
know
oh
i
know
that
i
love
you
far
far
more
than
i
can
tell
the
hand
which
lay
in
his
grew
cold
and
the
head
was
bowed
so
that
he
could
not
see
her
face
he
felt
her
tremble
marion
i
love
you
love
you
love
you
then
very
slowly
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
him
he
stooped
to
kiss
her
lips
and
felt
her
face
flush
and
glow
when
he
touched
it
then
she
drew
her
hands
from
his
and
fled
down
the
church
to
her
mother
hyacinth
stood
agape
with
wonder
at
the
words
which
he
had
spoken
the
knowledge
of
his
love
had
come
on
him
like
a
sudden
gust
and
he
only
half
realized
what
he
had
done
he
walked
back
to
his
lodgings
going
over
and
over
the
amazing
words
recalling
with
flushed
astonishment
the
kiss
then
a
chilling
doubt
beset
him
suddenly
did
marion
know
how
poor
he
was
never
in
his
life
had
the
fear
of
poverty
or
the
desire
of
gain
determined
plans
he
knew
very
well
that
no
such
considerations
would
have
in
any
way
affected
his
conduct
towards
marion
once
he
realized
that
he
loved
her
the
confession
of
his
love
was
quite
inevitable
yet
he
felt
vaguely
that
he
might
be
judged
blameworthy
he
had
read
a
few
novels
and
he
knew
that
even
the
writers
whose
chief
business
it
is
to
glorify
the
passion
of
love
do
not
dare
to
represent
it
as
independent
of
money
he
knew
too
that
many
penniless
heroes
won
admiration
he
did
not
in
the
least
understand
why
they
should
by
silently
deserting
affectionate
women
he
knew
that
kisses
were
immoral
except
for
those
who
possessed
a
modest
competence
these
authorized
ethics
of
marriage
engagements
were
wholly
incomprehensible
to
him
and
it
in
no
way
disquieted
his
conscience
that
he
had
bound
marion
to
him
with
his
kiss
yet
he
felt
that
she
had
a
right
to
know
what
income
he
hoped
to
earn
and
what
kind
of
home
he
would
have
to
offer
her
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
might
be
deemed
insufficient
and
he
knew
that
not
being
either
a
raven
or
a
lily
he
could
not
count
on
finding
food
and
clothes
ready
when
he
wanted
them
the
daughters
of
the
irish
church
clergy
even
of
the
dignitaries
are
not
brought
up
in
luxury
still
they
are
most
of
them
accustomed
to
a
daily
supply
of
food
plain
perhaps
but
sufficient
and
will
look
for
as
much
in
the
homes
of
their
husbands
a
girl
like
marion
beecher
does
not
expect
to
secure
a
position
which
will
enable
her
to
send
her
own
clothes
to
a
laundress
or
hire
a
cook
who
can
make
pastry
but
it
is
not
fair
to
ask
her
to
wash
the
blankets
or
to
boil
potatoes
for
a
pig
probably
her
friends
would
think
her
lucky
in
marrying
a
curate
or
a
dispensary
doctor
with
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
and
the
prospect
of
as
much
again
after
a
while
but
hyacinth
remembered
that
he
was
poorer
than
any
curate
he
determined
to
put
the
matter
plainly
before
marion
without
delay
the
rectory
door
was
opened
for
him
by
elsie
beecher
and
in
spite
of
her
wondering
protests
hyacinth
walked
into
the
and
asked
that
marion
should
be
sent
to
him
the
room
was
empty
as
he
expected
he
stood
and
waited
for
her
deriving
faint
comfort
and
courage
from
the
threadbare
carpet
patched
tablecloth
and
poor
crazy
chairs
they
were
strange
properties
for
a
scene
with
possibilities
of
deep
romance
in
it
but
they
made
his
confession
of
poverty
easier
marion
entered
at
last
and
stood
beside
him
he
neither
took
her
hand
nor
looked
at
her
i
told
you
that
i
loved
you
he
said
ought
to
have
told
you
that
i
am
very
know
it
she
said
i
am
poorer
even
than
you
know
i
am
not
in
employment
any
more
i
have
no
settled
income
and
only
a
prospect
of
earning
a
very
small
he
paused
shall
have
to
go
away
from
ballymoy
i
must
live
in
dublin
i
do
not
think
it
is
fair
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
i
shall
have
no
more
to
live
upon
than
she
moved
a
step
nearer
to
him
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
at
me
she
said
he
raised
his
eyes
to
her
face
and
saw
again
there
as
he
had
seen
in
church
the
wonderful
shining
of
love
which
is
stronger
than
all
things
and
holds
poverty
and
hardship
cheap
looking
at
me
still
she
said
tell
me
do
you
really
think
it
matters
that
you
are
poor
do
you
think
i
care
whether
you
have
much
or
little
tell
he
could
not
answer
her
although
he
knew
that
there
was
only
one
answer
to
her
question
you
think
that
i
love
money
do
you
doubt
that
i
love
you
her
voice
sunk
almost
to
a
whisper
as
she
spoke
and
her
eyes
fell
from
looking
into
his
just
as
when
he
kissed
her
in
the
church
she
flushed
suddenly
but
this
time
she
did
not
try
to
escape
from
him
instead
she
clung
to
his
arm
and
hid
her
face
against
his
shoulder
he
put
his
arms
round
her
and
held
her
close
know
he
said
was
a
fool
to
come
here
thinking
that
my
being
poor
would
matter
i
might
have
known
indeed
i
think
i
did
know
even
before
i
spoke
to
she
had
no
answer
except
a
long
soft
laugh
which
was
half
smothered
in
his
arms
chapter
xx
on
saturday
evenings
and
sunday
afternoons
canon
beecher
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
a
fire
in
his
study
he
was
supposed
to
be
engaged
at
these
seasons
in
the
preparation
of
his
sermons
a
serious
and
exacting
work
which
demanded
solitude
and
profound
quiet
in
earlier
years
he
really
had
prepared
his
sermons
painfully
but
long
practice
brings
to
the
preacher
a
certain
fatal
facility
old
ideas
are
not
improved
by
being
clothed
in
new
phrases
and
of
new
ideas
a
new
idea
will
occasionally
obtrude
itself
even
on
the
christian
preacher
the
canon
was
exceedingly
mistrustful
the
study
was
an
unexciting
and
comparatively
comfortable
room
the
firelight
on
winter
afternoons
played
pleasantly
on
the
dim
gold
backs
of
the
works
of
augustine
a
fine
folio
edition
bequeathed
to
beecher
by
a
scholarly
uncle
which
reposed
undisturbed
along
a
lower
shelf
adventurous
rays
occasionally
explored
a
faded
print
of
the
good
shepherd
which
hung
above
the
books
and
gleamed
upon
the
handle
of
the
safe
where
the
parish
registers
and
church
plate
were
stored
the
quiet
and
the
process
of
digesting
his
dinner
frequently
tempted
the
canon
to
indulge
in
a
series
of
pleasant
naps
on
sunday
afternoons
when
hyacinth
tapped
at
the
study
door
and
entered
the
room
was
almost
dark
and
the
sermon
preparation
if
proceeding
at
all
can
have
got
no
further
than
the
preliminary
concatenation
of
ideas
the
canon
however
was
aggressively
perhaps
suspiciously
wide
awake
is
that
he
asked
conneally
it
is
you
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
curiously
enough
i
thought
of
going
down
to
call
on
you
this
afternoon
i
wanted
to
have
a
talk
with
you
i
dare
say
you
have
come
up
to
consult
hyacinth
was
astonished
how
could
anyone
have
guessed
what
he
came
about
had
marion
told
her
father
already
is
a
sad
business
the
canon
went
on
very
distressing
and
perplexing
indeed
but
so
far
as
you
personally
are
concerned
conneally
i
can
not
regard
it
as
an
unmixed
misfortune
you
were
meant
for
something
better
if
i
may
say
so
than
selling
blankets
now
i
have
a
plan
for
your
future
which
i
talked
over
last
week
with
an
old
friend
of
yours
now
that
something
has
been
settled
about
the
quinns
we
must
all
give
our
minds
to
your
then
hyacinth
understood
that
canon
beecher
expected
to
be
consulted
about
his
future
plans
and
even
had
some
scheme
of
his
own
in
mind
he
replied
shall
be
very
glad
of
your
help
and
advice
although
i
think
i
have
decided
about
what
i
am
going
to
do
it
was
not
on
that
subject
i
came
to
speak
to
you
but
on
another
more
important
i
think
for
you
and
for
me
and
for
marion
ought
to
tell
you
at
once
that
i
love
your
daughter
marion
and
i
am
sure
that
she
loves
me
i
want
to
marry
dear
boy
i
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
this
it
is
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
things
or
perhaps
extraordinary
is
not
exactly
the
proper
word
one
of
the
most
surprising
things
i
the
canon
stopped
abruptly
and
sat
stroking
his
chin
with
his
forefinger
in
the
effort
to
adjust
his
mind
to
the
new
situation
presented
to
it
it
was
characteristic
of
the
man
that
the
thought
of
poverty
was
not
the
first
which
presented
itself
indeed
canon
beecher
was
one
of
those
unreasonable
christians
who
are
actually
convinced
of
the
truth
of
certain
paradoxical
sayings
in
the
gospel
about
wealth
and
poverty
he
believed
that
there
were
things
of
more
importance
in
life
than
the
possession
of
money
fortunately
such
christians
are
rare
for
their
absurd
creed
forms
a
standing
menace
to
the
existence
of
church
and
sect
alike
fortunately
also
ecclesiastical
authorities
have
sufficient
wisdom
to
keep
these
eccentrics
in
the
background
confining
them
as
far
as
possible
to
remote
and
obscure
places
if
ever
a
few
of
them
escape
into
the
open
and
find
means
of
expressing
themselves
the
whole
machinery
of
modern
religion
will
become
dislocated
and
the
church
will
very
likely
relapse
into
the
barbarity
of
the
apostolic
age
believe
conneally
said
the
canon
at
last
you
are
a
good
man
i
do
not
merely
mean
that
you
are
moral
and
upright
but
that
you
sincerely
desire
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
the
he
looked
as
if
he
wanted
some
kind
of
answer
at
least
a
confirmation
of
his
belief
fresh
from
his
interview
with
marion
and
having
the
eyes
upon
him
it
did
not
seem
impossible
to
hyacinth
to
answer
yes
even
the
thought
of
the
work
he
was
to
engage
in
with
miss
goold
and
patrick
seemed
to
offer
no
ground
for
hesitation
was
he
not
enlisting
with
them
to
take
part
in
the
great
battle
he
had
never
ceased
to
believe
his
words
the
battlefield
is
ireland
our
dear
ireland
which
we
love
he
felt
for
the
moment
that
he
was
altogether
prepared
to
make
the
confession
of
faith
the
canon
required
he
said
am
on
his
you
love
marion
are
you
quite
sure
of
that
are
you
certain
that
this
is
not
a
passing
fancy
this
time
hyacinth
had
no
doubt
whatever
about
his
answer
am
as
certain
of
my
love
as
i
am
of
anything
in
the
am
glad
i
am
very
glad
that
this
has
happened
for
your
sake
because
i
have
always
liked
you
also
for
sake
i
shall
see
you
happy
because
you
love
one
another
and
because
you
both
love
the
lord
i
ask
no
more
than
those
two
things
but
i
must
go
and
tell
my
wife
at
once
she
will
be
glad
he
rose
and
went
to
the
door
with
his
hand
stretched
out
to
open
it
he
stopped
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
the
way
i
ought
to
ask
you
if
you
mean
to
be
married
have
you
any
i
mean
it
is
necessary
i
hope
you
think
i
am
laying
undue
stress
upon
such
matters
but
i
really
i
mean
we
really
ought
to
consider
what
you
are
to
live
it
was
the
prospect
of
imparting
the
news
to
his
wife
which
forced
this
speech
from
him
beecher
was
indeed
the
least
worldly
of
women
did
she
not
marry
the
canon
then
a
mere
curate
on
the
slenderest
income
and
bear
him
successively
five
babies
in
defiance
of
common
prudence
but
it
had
fallen
to
her
lot
to
order
the
affairs
of
the
household
and
she
had
learnt
that
the
people
who
give
you
bread
and
beef
demand
after
an
interval
more
or
less
money
in
exchange
it
was
likely
that
after
her
first
rapture
had
subsided
she
would
make
some
inquiry
about
income
and
prospects
the
canon
felt
he
ought
to
be
prepared
course
i
have
lost
my
position
with
quinn
you
know
that
but
i
have
an
offer
of
work
which
i
hope
will
lead
on
to
something
better
and
will
enable
me
in
a
short
time
to
earn
enough
money
to
marry
on
you
know
or
perhaps
you
for
i
am
afraid
i
never
told
he
remembered
that
he
had
carefully
concealed
his
connection
with
the
from
his
friends
at
ballymoy
and
paused
have
done
some
little
writing
oh
nothing
very
much
not
a
book
or
anything
like
that
only
a
few
articles
for
the
press
well
a
friend
of
mine
has
got
me
the
offer
of
a
post
in
connection
with
a
weekly
paper
it
is
not
a
very
great
thing
in
itself
just
now
but
it
may
improve
and
there
is
always
the
prospect
of
picking
up
other
work
of
the
same
the
canon
who
had
never
seen
even
an
abstract
of
one
of
his
own
sermons
in
print
had
a
proper
reverence
for
the
men
who
guide
the
thought
through
the
press
is
very
good
conneally
very
satisfactory
indeed
i
always
knew
you
had
brains
but
why
did
you
never
tell
me
what
you
were
doing
i
should
have
been
deeply
interested
in
anything
you
conscience
smote
him
truth
is
that
i
was
sure
you
approve
of
the
paper
i
wrote
for
it
is
the
the
organ
of
the
extreme
left
wing
of
the
nationalist
party
it
is
miss
goold
augusta
goold
who
now
offers
me
work
on
that
paper
she
says
but
you
had
better
read
what
she
says
for
yourself
then
you
will
know
the
worst
of
he
took
the
letter
from
his
pocket
the
canon
lit
a
candle
and
read
it
through
slowly
and
attentively
when
he
had
finished
he
laid
it
upon
the
table
and
sat
down
hyacinth
waited
in
extreme
anxiety
for
what
was
to
come
do
not
like
the
cause
you
mean
to
work
for
or
the
people
you
call
your
friends
i
would
rather
see
my
husband
doing
almost
anything
else
in
the
world
i
would
be
happier
if
you
proposed
to
break
stones
upon
the
roadside
you
know
what
my
political
opinions
are
i
regard
the
as
a
disloyal
and
seditious
paper
bent
upon
fostering
a
dangerous
hyacinth
listened
patiently
he
had
steeled
himself
against
the
hearing
of
some
such
words
and
was
determined
not
to
be
moved
to
argument
or
except
as
a
last
resort
hope
he
said
you
will
at
least
give
me
credit
for
honestly
acting
in
accordance
with
my
am
sure
quite
sure
that
you
are
honest
and
believe
that
your
cause
is
the
right
one
i
recognise
too
though
this
is
a
very
difficult
thing
to
do
that
you
have
every
right
to
form
and
hold
your
own
political
opinions
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
very
wrong
and
very
mischievous
but
it
is
quite
possible
that
i
am
mistaken
and
prejudiced
in
any
case
i
am
not
called
upon
to
refuse
you
my
affection
or
to
separate
you
from
my
daughter
because
we
differ
about
hyacinth
breathed
a
great
sigh
of
relief
he
looked
at
the
canon
in
wonder
and
admiration
it
had
been
beyond
hope
that
a
man
grown
gray
in
a
narrow
faith
a
faith
in
which
for
centuries
religion
and
politics
had
been
inextricably
blended
could
have
risen
in
one
clear
flight
above
the
mire
of
prejudice
it
seemed
even
after
he
had
spoken
impossible
that
in
ireland
where
political
opponents
believe
each
other
to
be
thieves
and
murderers
there
could
be
found
even
one
man
and
he
from
the
least
emancipated
class
of
all
who
could
understand
and
practise
tolerance
say
went
on
the
canon
speaking
very
slowly
and
with
evident
difficulty
i
have
no
right
to
put
you
away
from
me
because
of
your
political
opinions
but
there
is
something
here
he
touched
miss
letter
from
which
i
must
by
all
means
try
to
save
you
will
you
let
me
speak
to
you
not
as
father
not
even
as
your
friend
but
as
ambassador
set
here
to
watch
for
your
soul
but
i
need
not
excuse
myself
for
what
i
am
about
to
say
you
will
at
least
listen
to
me
he
took
up
miss
letter
and
searched
through
it
for
a
short
time
then
he
read
aloud
just
asked
one
question
about
you
does
conneally
hate
england
and
the
empire
and
everything
english
from
the
parliament
to
the
police
barrack
for
it
is
this
hatred
which
must
animate
our
work
i
said
i
thought
you
now
consider
what
those
words
mean
you
are
to
dedicate
your
powers
the
talents
god
has
given
you
to
preaching
a
gospel
of
hate
this
is
not
a
question
of
politics
i
am
ready
to
believe
that
in
the
contest
of
which
our
unhappy
country
is
the
a
man
may
be
either
on
your
side
or
mine
and
yet
be
a
follower
of
christ
it
is
impossible
to
think
that
anyone
can
deliberately
with
his
eyes
open
accept
hatred
for
the
inspiration
of
his
life
and
still
be
true
to
hyacinth
was
greatly
moved
by
the
solemnity
with
which
the
canon
spoke
there
was
that
in
him
which
witnessed
to
the
truth
of
what
he
heard
yet
he
refused
to
be
convinced
when
he
spoke
it
was
clear
that
he
was
not
addressing
his
companion
for
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
picture
of
the
good
shepherd
faintly
illuminated
by
the
candle
light
he
desired
to
order
his
own
thought
on
the
dilemma
to
justify
if
he
could
his
own
position
to
himself
is
true
that
the
gospel
of
christ
is
a
gospel
of
love
yet
there
are
circumstances
in
which
it
is
wrong
to
follow
it
is
it
possible
to
rouse
our
people
out
of
their
sordid
apathy
to
save
ireland
for
a
place
among
the
nations
except
by
preaching
a
mighty
indignation
against
the
tyranny
which
has
crushed
us
to
the
dust
he
felt
that
canon
eyes
never
left
him
for
a
moment
while
he
spoke
he
looked
up
and
saw
in
them
an
intense
pleading
there
stole
over
him
a
desire
to
yield
to
submit
himself
to
this
appealing
tenderness
he
defended
himself
desperately
against
his
weakness
am
not
choosing
the
pleasanter
way
it
would
be
easier
for
me
to
give
up
the
fight
for
ireland
to
desert
the
beaten
side
to
forget
the
lost
he
turned
to
canon
beecher
speaking
almost
fiercely
you
think
it
is
a
small
thing
for
me
to
surrender
your
friendship
and
perhaps
perhaps
to
lose
marion
is
there
not
of
the
nobility
of
sacrifice
in
refusing
to
listen
to
you
can
not
argue
with
you
no
doubt
you
are
cleverer
than
i
am
but
i
this
god
is
love
and
only
he
who
dwelleth
in
love
dwelleth
in
i
do
love
i
love
yes
but
he
says
your
said
hyacinth
will
not
have
him
for
my
hardly
had
he
spoken
than
he
started
and
grew
suddenly
cold
it
was
no
doubt
some
trick
of
memory
but
he
believed
that
he
heard
very
faintly
from
far
off
a
remembered
voice
you
be
sure
to
know
the
good
side
from
the
bad
the
captain
from
the
they
were
the
last
words
his
father
had
said
to
him
they
had
passed
unregarded
when
they
were
spoken
but
lingered
unthought
of
in
some
recess
of
his
memory
now
they
came
on
him
full
of
meaning
insistent
for
an
answer
have
chosen
said
the
canon
he
had
chosen
could
he
be
sure
that
he
had
chosen
right
that
he
knew
the
good
side
from
the
bad
have
chosen
and
i
have
no
more
to
say
only
before
it
becomes
impossible
for
you
and
me
to
kneel
together
i
ask
you
to
let
me
pray
with
you
once
more
you
can
do
this
because
you
still
believe
he
hears
us
although
you
have
decided
to
walk
no
more
with
they
knelt
together
and
hyacinth
numbly
indifferent
felt
his
hand
grasped
and
held
christ
said
canon
beecher
child
of
thine
has
chosen
to
live
by
hatred
rather
than
by
love
do
thou
therefore
remove
love
from
him
lest
it
prove
a
hindrance
to
him
on
the
way
on
which
he
goes
let
the
memory
of
the
cross
be
blotted
out
from
his
mind
so
that
he
may
do
successfully
that
which
he
hyacinth
wrenched
his
hand
free
from
the
grasp
which
held
it
and
flung
himself
forward
across
the
table
at
which
they
knelt
except
for
his
sobs
and
his
choking
efforts
to
subdue
them
there
was
silence
in
the
room
canon
beecher
rose
from
his
knees
and
stood
watching
him
his
lips
moving
with
unspoken
supplication
at
last
hyacinth
also
rose
and
stood
calm
suddenly
have
conquered
me
he
said
son
my
son
this
is
joy
indeed
all
along
i
knew
he
could
not
fail
you
but
i
have
not
conquered
you
the
lord
jesus
has
saved
do
not
know
said
hyacinth
slowly
i
have
been
saved
or
lost
i
am
not
sure
even
now
that
i
know
the
good
side
from
the
bad
but
i
do
know
that
i
can
not
live
without
the
hope
of
being
loved
by
him
whether
it
is
the
better
part
to
which
i
resign
myself
i
can
not
tell
no
doubt
he
knows
as
for
me
if
i
have
been
forced
to
make
a
great
betrayal
if
i
am
to
live
hereafter
very
basely
and
i
think
i
am
at
least
i
have
not
cut
myself
off
from
the
opportunity
of
loving
chapter
xxi
canon
beecher
took
no
notice
of
last
speech
he
had
returned
with
amazing
swiftness
and
ease
from
the
region
of
high
emotion
to
the
commonplace
excursions
to
the
shining
peaks
of
mystical
experience
are
for
most
men
so
rare
that
the
glory
leaves
them
with
dazzled
eyes
and
they
walk
stumblingly
for
a
while
along
the
dull
roads
of
the
world
but
canon
beecher
in
the
course
of
his
pleading
with
hyacinth
had
been
only
in
places
very
well
known
to
him
the
presence
chamber
of
the
king
was
to
him
also
the
room
of
a
familiar
friend
it
was
no
breathless
descent
from
the
green
hill
of
the
cross
to
the
thoroughfare
of
common
life
my
dear
boy
he
said
really
must
go
and
talk
to
my
wife
and
marion
besides
i
must
tell
you
the
plan
i
have
made
for
you
the
plan
i
was
just
going
to
speak
about
when
you
put
it
out
of
my
head
with
the
news
of
your
for
hyacinth
a
great
effort
was
necessary
before
he
could
get
back
to
his
normal
state
his
hands
were
trembling
violently
his
forehead
and
hair
were
damp
with
sweat
his
whole
body
was
intensely
cold
his
mind
was
confused
and
he
listened
to
what
was
said
to
him
with
only
the
vaguest
apprehension
of
its
meaning
the
canon
laid
a
firm
hand
upon
his
arm
and
led
him
away
from
the
study
in
the
passage
he
stopped
and
asked
hyacinth
to
go
back
and
blow
out
the
candle
which
still
burned
on
the
study
table
just
put
some
turf
on
the
fire
he
added
want
it
to
go
the
pause
enabled
hyacinth
to
regain
his
and
the
performance
of
the
perfectly
ordinary
acts
required
of
him
helped
to
bring
him
back
again
to
common
life
when
they
entered
the
it
was
evident
that
beecher
had
already
heard
the
news
and
was
in
fact
discussing
the
matter
eagerly
with
marion
she
sprang
up
and
hastened
across
the
room
to
meet
them
am
so
glad
she
said
delighted
i
am
sure
you
and
marion
will
be
happy
she
took
hands
in
hers
and
held
them
while
she
spoke
then
drew
nearer
to
him
and
looked
up
in
his
face
expectantly
a
fearful
suspicion
seized
him
that
on
an
occasion
of
the
kind
she
might
consider
it
right
to
kiss
him
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
he
suppressed
a
wholly
unreasonable
impulse
to
laugh
aloud
apparently
the
need
of
such
affectionate
stimulant
was
strong
in
beecher
when
hyacinth
hung
back
she
left
him
for
her
husband
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
heartily
on
both
cheeks
it
fortunate
she
said
you
saw
henry
last
week
while
you
were
in
dublin
you
little
thought
how
important
that
talk
with
him
was
going
to
turn
out
i
mean
of
course
important
for
us
it
always
was
important
for
i
mean
for
the
canon
seemed
a
little
embarrassed
he
cleared
his
throat
somewhat
unnecessarily
and
then
said
mentioned
that
matter
mentioned
offer
then
what
have
you
been
talking
about
all
this
time
it
did
not
seem
necessary
to
tell
beecher
all
that
had
been
said
or
to
repeat
the
scene
in
the
study
for
her
benefit
the
canon
cleared
his
throat
again
was
in
dublin
last
week
attending
a
meeting
of
the
scriptural
schools
society
and
i
met
henry
we
were
talking
about
the
quinns
i
told
you
that
quinn
is
to
be
the
new
secretary
of
the
society
i
henry
knows
quinn
slightly
and
was
greatly
interested
in
him
your
name
naturally
was
mentioned
henry
seems
to
have
taken
a
warm
interest
in
you
when
you
were
in
college
and
to
have
a
very
high
opinion
of
your
abilities
he
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
you
and
was
very
pleased
to
hear
that
you
were
a
friend
of
hyacinth
knew
at
once
what
was
coming
knew
what
canon
plan
for
his
future
was
and
why
he
was
pleased
with
it
understood
how
beecher
came
to
describe
this
conversation
with
henry
as
fortunate
he
waited
for
the
rest
of
the
recital
vaguely
surprised
at
his
own
want
of
feeling
told
him
the
canon
went
on
eying
hyacinth
doubtfully
you
had
lost
your
employment
here
i
hope
you
object
to
my
having
mentioned
that
i
am
sure
you
if
you
had
heard
how
sympathetically
he
spoke
of
you
he
assured
me
that
he
was
most
anxious
to
help
you
in
any
way
in
his
power
he
just
asked
one
question
about
hyacinth
started
where
had
he
heard
those
identical
words
before
oh
yes
they
were
in
miss
letter
patrick
also
had
just
asked
one
question
about
him
he
smiled
faintly
as
the
canon
went
on
he
fit
spiritually
fit
to
be
ordained
for
it
is
the
desire
to
serve
god
which
must
animate
our
i
said
i
thought
you
were
i
told
him
how
you
sang
in
our
choir
here
and
how
fond
you
seemed
of
our
quiet
life
and
what
a
good
fellow
you
are
you
see
i
did
not
know
then
that
i
was
praising
the
man
who
is
to
be
my
he
asked
me
to
remind
you
of
a
promise
he
had
once
made
and
to
say
that
he
was
ready
to
fufil
it
i
understood
him
to
mean
that
he
would
recommend
you
to
any
bishop
you
like
for
hyacinth
remained
silent
he
felt
that
in
surrendering
his
work
for
the
he
surrendered
also
his
right
to
make
any
choice
he
was
ready
to
be
shepherded
into
any
position
like
a
sheep
into
a
pen
and
he
had
no
particular
wish
to
resist
he
saw
a
simple
satisfaction
in
face
and
a
beautiful
joy
in
eyes
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
disappoint
them
he
smiled
a
response
to
kindly
triumph
that
splendid
now
you
and
marion
will
be
able
to
be
married
quite
soon
and
i
do
dislike
long
engagements
of
course
you
will
be
very
poor
at
first
but
no
poorer
than
we
were
and
marion
is
not
afraid
of
being
poor
are
you
dear
is
just
what
i
have
been
saying
to
him
said
marion
it
hyacinth
of
course
i
am
not
afraid
i
have
always
said
that
if
i
ever
married
i
should
like
to
marry
a
clergyman
and
if
one
does
that
one
is
sure
to
be
evidently
there
was
no
doubt
in
either
of
their
minds
that
hyacinth
would
accept
offer
nor
had
he
any
doubt
himself
the
thing
seemed
too
inevitable
to
be
anything
but
right
only
on
canon
face
there
lingered
a
shadow
of
uncertainty
hyacinth
saw
it
and
relieved
his
mind
at
once
shall
write
to
henry
and
thank
him
i
shall
ask
him
to
try
and
get
me
a
curacy
as
soon
as
you
said
the
canon
think
added
hyacinth
i
should
prefer
getting
work
in
why
said
beecher
it
be
better
to
stay
in
ireland
and
then
we
might
have
marion
somewhere
within
dear
said
the
canon
must
let
hyacinth
decide
for
himself
i
am
sure
he
knows
what
is
wisest
for
him
to
hyacinth
was
not
at
all
sure
that
he
knew
what
was
wisest
and
he
was
quite
certain
that
he
had
not
decided
for
himself
in
any
matter
of
the
slightest
importance
he
had
suggested
an
english
curacy
in
the
vague
hope
that
it
might
be
easier
there
to
forget
his
hopes
and
dreams
for
ireland
it
seemed
to
him
too
that
a
voluntary
exile
of
which
he
could
not
think
without
pain
might
be
a
kind
of
atonement
for
the
betrayal
of
his
old
enthusiasm
the
canon
followed
him
to
the
door
when
he
left
dear
there
was
a
break
in
his
voice
as
he
spoke
my
dear
boy
you
have
made
me
very
happy
i
am
sure
that
you
will
not
enter
upon
the
work
of
the
ministry
from
any
unworthy
motive
the
call
will
become
clearer
to
you
by
degrees
i
mean
the
inward
call
the
outward
call
the
leading
of
circumstance
has
already
made
abundantly
plain
the
way
you
ought
to
walk
in
the
other
will
come
the
voice
which
brings
assurance
and
peace
when
it
hyacinth
looked
at
him
wistfully
there
seemed
very
little
possibility
of
anything
like
assurance
for
him
and
only
such
peace
as
might
be
gained
by
smothering
the
cries
with
which
his
heart
assailed
him
the
canon
held
his
hand
and
wrung
it
can
understand
why
you
want
to
go
to
england
your
political
opinions
will
interfere
very
little
with
your
work
there
here
of
course
it
would
be
different
yes
your
choice
is
certainly
wise
for
nothing
must
be
allowed
to
hinder
your
work
aside
every
weight
you
remember
us
run
the
yes
i
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
hyacinth
that
the
canon
did
not
understand
in
the
least
it
was
not
likely
that
anyone
ever
would
understand
gradually
his
despondency
gave
way
before
the
crowding
in
of
thoughts
of
satisfaction
he
was
to
have
marion
to
live
with
her
to
love
her
and
be
loved
by
her
as
long
as
they
both
lived
he
saw
life
stretching
out
before
him
a
sunlit
pleasant
journey
in
company
it
did
not
seem
to
him
that
any
trouble
could
be
really
bad
any
disappointment
intolerable
any
toil
oppressive
with
her
love
for
an
atmosphere
round
him
he
believed
too
that
the
work
he
was
undertaking
was
a
good
work
perhaps
the
highest
and
noblest
kind
of
work
there
is
to
be
done
in
the
world
from
this
conviction
also
came
a
glow
of
happiness
yet
there
kept
recurring
chill
shudderings
of
something
within
him
kept
whispering
that
he
had
bartered
his
soul
for
happiness
have
chosen
the
easier
and
therefore
the
baser
way
he
said
have
shrunk
from
toil
and
pain
i
have
refused
to
make
the
sacrifice
demanded
of
he
went
back
again
to
the
story
of
his
vision
for
a
moment
it
seemed
quite
clear
that
he
had
deliberately
refused
the
call
to
the
great
fight
that
he
had
judged
himself
unworthy
being
cowardly
and
selfish
in
his
heart
then
he
remembered
that
the
captain
of
whom
his
father
had
told
him
was
no
one
else
but
christ
the
same
christ
of
whom
canon
beecher
spoke
the
good
shepherd
whose
love
he
had
discovered
to
be
the
greatest
need
of
all
must
have
him
he
said
must
have
him
and
again
with
the
renewed
decision
came
a
glow
of
happiness
and
a
sense
of
rest
until
there
rose
as
if
to
smite
him
the
thought
of
ireland
of
ireland
poor
derided
of
strangers
deserted
by
her
sons
roped
in
as
a
where
selfish
men
struggle
ignobly
for
sordid
gains
the
children
of
the
land
fled
from
it
sick
with
despair
its
deserted
houses
were
full
of
all
doleful
things
cormorants
and
the
daughters
of
the
owl
lodged
in
the
lintels
of
them
sullen
desolation
was
on
the
threshold
while
satyrs
cried
to
their
fellows
across
tracts
of
brown
land
aliens
came
to
hiss
and
passed
by
wagging
their
hands
over
all
was
the
monotony
of
the
gray
sky
descending
and
still
descending
with
clouds
that
came
upon
the
land
mistily
folding
it
in
close
embraces
of
death
voices
sounded
far
off
and
unreal
through
the
gloom
the
final
convulsive
struggles
of
the
life
grew
feebler
and
fewer
of
all
causes
seemed
the
most
hopelessly
lost
was
he
too
going
to
forsake
her
he
felt
that
in
spite
of
all
the
good
promised
him
there
would
always
hang
over
his
life
a
gloom
that
even
love
would
not
disperse
the
heavy
shadow
of
calvary
for
marion
there
would
be
no
such
darkness
nor
would
marion
understand
it
but
surely
christ
understood
words
of
his
crowded
to
the
memory
he
beheld
the
city
he
wept
over
it
saying
oh
jerusalem
jerusalem
most
certainly
he
understood
this
as
he
understood
all
human
emotion
he
too
had
yearned
over
a
fall
had
felt
the
heartbreak
of
the
patriot
have
chosen
him
he
said
at
last
having
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
i
could
not
do
without
him
he
understands
it
all
and
he
has
given
me
chapter
xxii
it
was
a
brilliant
july
day
and
the
convent
at
robeen
was
decked
for
a
festival
the
occasion
was
a
very
great
one
cloth
of
gold
hung
in
the
chapel
the
was
splendid
with
flowers
and
the
whole
white
front
of
the
buildings
had
put
on
signs
of
holiday
indeed
this
festival
was
unique
the
very
greatest
day
in
the
history
of
the
sisterhood
easter
christmas
and
the
days
recurred
annually
in
their
proper
order
and
the
emotions
they
brought
with
them
were
no
doubt
familiar
to
holy
ladies
whose
business
it
was
to
live
in
close
touch
with
the
other
world
but
on
this
day
the
great
of
the
earth
beings
much
more
unapproachable
as
a
rule
than
the
saints
were
to
visit
the
convent
honour
was
to
be
paid
to
ladies
whose
magnificence
was
guaranteed
by
worldly
titles
to
the
proconsuls
of
the
imperial
power
holders
of
the
of
the
richest
nation
upon
earth
to
judges
accustomed
to
sit
in
splendid
robes
and
awful
pronouncing
the
doom
of
malefactors
to
a
member
of
the
cabinet
a
very
mighty
man
though
untitled
and
quite
possibly
a
glittering
hope
to
the
lord
lieutenant
himself
it
was
therefore
no
wonder
that
the
nuns
had
decked
their
convent
with
all
possible
splendour
on
each
side
of
the
iron
gateway
was
a
from
the
top
of
one
fluttered
the
green
banner
of
ireland
with
its
gold
harp
and
a
great
crown
over
it
from
the
other
hung
the
union
jack
emblem
of
that
marriage
of
nationalities
for
whose
consummation
eight
centuries
have
not
sufficed
it
was
hoisted
upside
down
not
with
intentional
disrespect
but
because
sister
gertrude
who
superintended
this
part
of
the
decorations
had
long
ago
renounced
the
world
and
did
not
remember
that
the
tangled
crosses
had
a
top
or
a
bottom
to
them
between
the
posts
hung
a
festoon
of
signalling
flags
long
pointed
strips
of
bunting
with
red
balls
or
blue
on
them
the
central
streamer
just
tipped
as
it
fluttered
the
top
of
the
iron
cross
which
marked
the
religious
nature
of
the
gateway
the
straight
gravel
walk
inside
was
covered
with
red
baize
and
on
each
side
of
it
were
planted
tapering
poles
round
which
crimson
and
white
muslin
circled
in
alternate
stripes
giving
them
the
appearance
of
huge
these
added
to
the
gaiety
of
the
scene
though
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
they
were
of
any
actual
use
the
most
bewildered
visitor
was
hardly
likely
to
stray
off
the
red
baize
or
miss
his
way
to
the
door
in
front
of
him
within
the
great

palms
and
flowering
shrubs
in
pots
or
tubs
the
mosaic
flooring
imported
from
italy
and
a
source
of
pride
to
all
the
sisters
shone
with
much
washing
and
polishing
the
madonna
with
the
blue
eyes
and
the
golden
crown
before
which
even
bishops
crossed
themselves
was
less
in
evidence
than
usual
for
the
expected
guests
were
mostly
heretics
she
stood
retired
behind
the
and
veiled
her
benignity
with
the
leaves
of
palms
right
and
left
of
the
hall
stretched
corridors
whose
shining
parquet
invited
the
curious
to
explore

which
lay

open
and
offered
a
vision
of
simpering
angels
crowding

canvas
of

specimen
of
german
religious
art

it
dimly
seen
two
nuns

of
conventual
piety
absorbed
in
spiritual
contemplation
amid
the
tumult
of
the
invasion
of
their
sanctuary

to
the
garden
here
a
fountain
played
into
a
great
stone

neat
gravel
walks
intersected

sharp
angles
among

lay
around

maze

sacred
as
a
rule
even
from

list
slippers
of
the
nuns
but
booths
stood
on
it
like
stalls
at
a
charity
bazaar
hung
with
tweeds

and
stockings

tall
calvary

incongruously
over

the

which
was
drawing
the
great
of

to
the
nunnery
here
were
the
workers
all
of
them
bright
young
women
smiling
pleasantly
and
well
washed
for
the
occasion
they
were
dressed
in
neat
violet
petticoats
and
white
blouses
with
shawls
thrown
back
from
their
heads
a
glorified
presentment
of

in
bare

not
of
course

or

as
bare
feet
are
apt
to
be
in

but
clean
the
careful
observer
of
detail
might
have
been
led
to
suppose
that
the
sisters
improved
upon
the
practice
of
the
holy
father
himself
and
daily
washed
the
feet
of
the
poor
everywhere
nuns
flitted
silently
about
the
brass
crosses
pendent
over
their
breasts
relieved
with
a
single
glitter
the
sombre
folds
of
their
robes
snowy
coifs
which
had
cost
the
industrial
schoolgirls
of
a
sister
house
hours
of
labour
and
many
tears
shone
glazed
and
unwrinkled
round
their
heads
even
the
youngest
of
them
had
acquired
the
difficult
art
of
walking
gracefully
with
her
hands
folded
in
front
of
her
at
about
two
the
visitors
began
to
arrive
although
the
train
from
dublin
which
was
to
bring
the
very
elect
was
not
due
for
another
lady
geoghegan
grown
pleasantly
stout
and
cheerfully
benignant
came
by
a
local
train
and
rejoiced
the
eyes
of
beholders
with
a
dress
made
of
one
of
the
convent
tweeds
sir
gerald
followed
her
awkward
and
unwilling
he
had
been
dragged
with
difficulty
from
his
books
and
the
society
of
his
children
and
was
doubtful
whether
a
cigar
in
a
nunnery
garden
might
not
be
counted
sacrilege
with
them
was
a
wonderful
person
an
english
priest
it
was
thus
he
described
himself
whom
lady
geoghegan
had
met
in
yorkshire
his
charming
manners
and
good
church
principles
had
won
her
favour
and
earned
him
the
holiday
he
was
enjoying
at
clogher
house
he
was
arrayed
in
a
pair
of
gray
trousers
a
white
shirt
and
a
blazer
with
the
arms
of
brazenose
college
embroidered
on
the
pocket
his
sacerdotal
character
being
marked
only
by
his
collar
he
leaped
gaily
from
the
car
which
brought
them
from
the
station
and
as
he
assisted
his
hostess
to
alight
amazed
the
little
crowd
around
the
gate
by
chaffing
the
driver
in
an
entirely
unknown
tongue
the
good
man
had
an
ear
for
music
and
plumed
himself
on
his
ability
to
pick
up
any
dialect
he
heard
scotch
yorkshire
or
irish
brogue
the
driver
was
bewildered
but
smiled
pleasantly
he
realized
that
the
gentleman
was
a
foreigner
and
since
the
meaning
of
his
speech
was
not
clear
it
was
quite
likely
that
he
might
be
hazy
about
the
value
of
money
and
the
rates
of
car
hire
the
duchess
of
drummin
came
in
her
landau
like
lady
geoghegan
she
marked
the
national
and
industrial
nature
of
the
occasion
in
her
attire
at
much
personal
inconvenience
for
the
day
was
warm
she
wore
a
long
cloak
of
rich
brown
tweed
adorned
with
rows
of
large
buttons
lady
josephine
maguire
fluttered
after
her
she
had
bidden
her
maid
disguise
a
dress
neither
irish
nor
homespun
with
as
much
carrickmacross
lace
as
could
be
attached
to
it
lord
eustace
who
represented
his
father
appeared
in
all
the
glory
of
a
silk
hat
and
a
he
eyed
sir
baggy
trousers
and
shabby
wideawake
with
contempt
and
turned
away
his
eyes
from
beholding
the
vanity
of
obviously
bad
form
when
he
came
face
to
face
with
the
english
priest
in
his
blazer
a
smiling
nun
took
charge
of
each
party
as
it
arrived
lady
geoghegan
plied
hers
with
questions
and
received
a
series
of
quite
uninforming
answers
her
husband
followed
her
bent
principally
upon
escaping
from
the
precincts
if
he
could
already
he
was
bored
and
he
knew
that
speeches
from
great
men
were
in
store
for
him
if
he
were
forced
to
linger
the
duchess
of
drummin
eyed
each
object
presented
to
her
notice
gravely
through
glasses
but
gave
her
attendant
nun
very
little
conversational
help
lady
josephine
made
every
effort
to
be
intelligent
and
inquired
in
a
dormitory
where
the
were
she
was
amazed
to
hear
that
the
nuns
did
or
failed
to
do
their
hair
the
concealed
the
result
of
their
efforts
without
mirrors
lord
eustace
was
preoccupied
amid
his
unaccustomed
surroundings
he
walked
uncertain
whether
to
keep
his
hat
on
his
head
or
hold
it
in
his
hands
the
english
priest
whose
name
was
austin
got
detached
from
lady
geoghegan
and
picked
up
a
stray
nun
for
himself
she
took
him
by
his
own
request
straight
to
the
chapel
he
crossed
himself
with
elaborate
care
on
entering
and
knelt
for
a
moment
before
the
altar
the
nun
was
delighted
you
too
are
a
catholic
he
replied
briskly
english
many
of
our
priests
go
to
england
perhaps
you
have
met
father
he
is
on
a
london
said
austin
do
not
happen
to
have
met
him
my
church
is
in
the
nun
gazed
at
him
in
amazement
church
then
you
are
he
said
am
a
her
eyes
slowly
travelled
over
him
they
began
at
the
gray
trousers
passed
to
the
blazer
resting
a
moment
on
the
college
arms
which
certainly
suggested
the
ecclesiastical
and
remained
fixed
on
his
collar
after
all
why
should
she
a
humble
nun
doubt
his
word
when
he
said
he
was
a
priest
perhaps
he
might
belong
to
some
order
of
which
she
had
never
heard
eccentricities
of
costume
might
be
forced
on
the
english
clergy
by
protestant
intolerance
she
smothered
her
uncertainty
and
took
him
at
his
word
they
went
together
into
the
garden
austin
took
off
his
hat
before
the
tarnished
madonna
and
crossed
himself
again
the
doubts
vanished
think
he
said
i
should
like
to
buy
some
of
this
tweed
is
it
for
sale
certainly
sister
aloysia
will
sell
it
to
you
we
are
so
glad
so
very
glad
when
anyone
will
buy
what
our
poor
workers
make
it
is
all
a
help
to
the
good
this
said
austin
fingering
a
cloth
make
a
nice
dress
you
think
so
the
nun
cast
down
her
eyes
do
not
know
father
about
dresses
sister
aloysia
the
reverend
father
wants
to
buy
tweed
to
make
a
dress
for
she
hesitated
perhaps
it
was
his
niece
but
he
looked
young
to
have
a
niece
his
sister
aloysia
looked
round
her
puzzled
she
saw
no
reverend
father
said
the
other
father
father
he
helped
her
out
austin
added
the
nun
you
wish
said
sister
aloysia
buy
a
dress
for
your
sister
for
my
sister
said
austin
my
both
nuns
started
back
as
if
he
had
tried
to
strike
them
wife
your
wife
then
you
are
a
not
he
said
detest
all
protestants
i
am
a
catholic
an
neither
of
the
nuns
had
ever
heard
of
an
before
what
manner
of
religion
such
people
might
profess
was
doubtful
and
unimportant
one
thing
was
clear
this
was
not
a
priest
in
any
sense
of
the
word
which
they
could
recognise
they
distrusted
him
as
a
wolf
not
certainly
in
the
clothing
but
using
the
language
of
a
sheep
the
situation
became
embarrassing
austin
prepared
to
bow
himself
away
think
he
said
shall
ask
lady
he
rolled
the
title
out
emphatically
it
formed
a
salve
to
his
wounded
dignity
shall
ask
lady
geoghegan
to
purchase
the
tweed
for
me
i
must
be
on
the
for
a
friend
who
promised
to
meet
me
here
this
afternoon
a
young
man
whom
i
contemplate
engaging
as
my
curate
i
am
most
particular
in
the
choice
of
a
curate
and
should
of
course
prefer
a
public
school
and
man
i
need
scarcely
say
that
i
refer
only
to
oxford
and
cambridge
as
the
universities
as
a
rule
i
do
not
care
for
irishmen
but
on
the
recommendation
of
my
friend
henry
i
am
willing
to
consider
this
it
seemed
to
austin
that
a
preference
for
the
english
universities
the
friendship
of
a
distinguished
professor
a
contempt
for
the
mere
irishman
and
a
titled
hostess
ought
to
restore
the
respect
he
had
forfeited
by
the
mention
of
his
wife
curiously
enough
and
this
shows
the
disadvantage
of
a
monastic
seclusion
from
the
world
the
nuns
remained
unimpressed
the
conception
of
a
married
priest
was
too
much
for
them
as
he
walked
away
austin
heard
sister
aloysia
murmur
very
indecent
meanwhile
the
train
from
dublin
had
arrived
and
austin
when
he
returned
after
his
interview
with
hyacinth
found
that
even
the
two
nuns
he
had
victimized
had
forgotten
him
in
the
excitement
of
gazing
at
more
important
visitors
justice
saunders
a
tall
stout
man
with
a
florid
face
made
a
tour
of
the
factory
under
the
charge
of
one
of
the
senior
sisters
he
took
little
notice
of
what
he
was
shown
being
mainly
bent
on
explaining
to
his
escort
how
he
came
to
be
known
in
legal
circles
as
afterwards
he
added
a
tale
of
how
he
had
once
bluffed
a
crowd
in
an
country
town
into
giving
three
cheers
for
the
queen
all
loyal
here
he
said
saw
the
union
jack
flying
over
the
gate
as
i
came
the
nun
smiled
a
slow
enigmatic
smile
and
the
judge
watching
her
was
struck
by
her
innocence
and
simplicity
she
said
church
must
always
be
not
so
sure
of
that
met
a
few
firebrands
of
priests
in
my
those
she
said
with
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
must
not
think
of
them
it
will
always
be
easy
to
keep
them
in
order
when
the
time
comes
they
spring
from
the
cabins
what
can
you
expect
of
them
but
the
church
can
the
church
fail
of
respect
for
the
sovereign
clifford
and
davis
followed
judge
saunders
they
were
members
of
the
congested
districts
board
and
it
was
clear
from
the
manner
of
the
nun
who
escorted
them
that
they
were
guests
of
very
considerable
importance
in
her
estimation
clifford
was
an
englishman
who
had
been
imported
to
assist
in
governing
ireland
because
he
was
married
to
the
sister
of
the
chief
wife
he
was
otherwise
qualified
for
the
task
by
possessing
a
fair
knowledge
of
the
points
of
a
horse
he
believed
that
he
knew
ireland
and
the
irish
people
thoroughly
his
colleague
davis
was
a
man
of
quite
a
different
stamp
the
son
of
a
presbyterian
farmer
in
county
tyrone
he
had
joined
the
irish
parliamentary
party
and
made
himself
particularly
objectionable
in
westminster
he
had
devoted
his
talents
to
discovering
and
publishing
the
principles
upon
which
appointments
to
lucrative
posts
are
made
by
the
officials
in
dublin
castle
it
was
found
convenient
at
last
to
provide
him
with
a
salary
and
a
seat
on
the
congested
districts
board
thus
he
found
himself
engaged
in
ameliorating
the
lot
of
the
connaught
peasants
clifford
used
to
describe
him
as
bit
of
a
bounder
in
fact
a
complete
outsider
but
no
his
estimate
of
clifford
was
perhaps
less
complimentary
business
he
used
to
say
have
at
least
one
gentleman
in
it
to
do
the
entertaining
and
the
dining
out
we
have
clifford
a
man
at
one
of
the
lord
a
professor
from
trinity
college
was
one
of
the
two
guests
conducted
by
the
reverend
mother
herself
nominally
this
learned
gentleman
existed
for
the
purpose
of
impressing
upon
the
world
the
beauties
of
latin
poetry
but
he
was
best
known
to
fame
as
an
orator
on
the
platforms
of
the
primrose
league
and
a
writer
of
magazine
articles
on
irish
questions
he
was
a
man
who
owed
his
success
in
life
largely
to
his
faculty
for
always
keeping
beside
the
most
important
person
present
the
lord
lieutenant
being
slightly
indisposed
had
been
unable
to
make
an
early
start
so
the
most
honourable
stranger
was
chesney
the
chief
secretary
to
him
professor
cairns
attached
himself
and
received
a
share
of
the
reverend
blandishments
chesney
himself
was
dapper
and
smiling
as
usual
even
the
early
hour
at
which
he
had
been
obliged
to
leave
home
had
neither
ruffled
his
temper
nor
withered
the
flower
in
his
buttonhole
he
spent
his
money
generously
at
the
various
stalls
in
the
garden
addressed
friendly
remarks
to
the
women
in
the
factory
and
asked
the
questions
with
which
davis
had
primed
him
in
the
train
quite
a
crowd
of
minor
people
followed
the
great
statesman
there
were
barristers
who
hoped
to
become
county
court
judges
and
ladies
who
enjoyed
a
novel
kind
of
occasion
for
displaying
their
clothes
hoping
to
see
their
names
afterwards
in
the
newspaper
accounts
of
the
proceedings
there
were
a
few
foremen
from
leading
dublin
shops
who
foresaw
the
possibility
of
a
fashionable
boom
in
robeen
tweeds
and
flannels
there
were
also
reporters
from
the
dublin
papers
and
a
representative
miss
of
a
syndicate
which
supplied
journals
with
accounts
of
the
clothes
worn
at
fashionable
functions
the
supreme
moment
of
the
day
arrived
when
the
company
assembled
to
listen
to
words
of
wisdom
from
the
orators
selected
to
address
them
seats
had
been
provided
by
carting
in
forms
from
the
neighbouring
national
schools
a
chair
of
ecclesiastical
design
awaited
chesney
he
opened
his
speech
by
assuring
his
audience
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
him
to
address
them
at
all
a
truth
which
struck
home
to
the
heart
of
sir
gerald
who
was
trying
to
arrange
himself
comfortably
at
a
desk
designed
for
a
class
of
infants
chesney
explained
himself
more
eloquent
than
words
you
have
seen
what
i
could
never
have
described
to
you
the
contented
workers
in
this
factory
and
the
artistic
designs
of
the
fabrics
they
weave
many
of
you
remember
what
robeen
was
a
few
years
ago
a
howling
wilderness
we
are
told
on
high
authority
that
even
the
wilderness
shall
blossom
as
a
he
bowed
in
the
direction
of
the
reverend
mother
possibly
with
a
feeling
that
it
was
suitable
to
acknowledge
her
presence
when
quoting
holy
writ
possibly
with
a
vague
idea
that
she
might
consider
herself
a
spiritual
descendant
of
the
prophet
isaiah
see
it
now
a
hive
of
happy
he
observed
with
pleasure
that
the
reporters
were
busy
with
their
and
he
knew
that
these
editors
of
public
utterance
might
be
relied
on
to
unravel
a
tangled
metaphor
before
publishing
a
speech
he
went
on
confident
that
in
the
next
papers
his
wilderness
would
blossom
into
something
else
and
that
the
hive
if
it
appeared
at
all
would
be
arrived
at
by
some
other
process
than
blossoming
the
habit
of
rolling
out
agreeable
platitudes
to
audiences
forced
to
listen
is
one
which
grows
on
public
men
as
does
on
the
common
herd
chesney
was
evidently
enjoying
himself
and
there
seemed
no
reason
why
he
should
ever
stop
he
could
and
perhaps
would
have
gone
on
for
hours
but
for
the
offensive
way
in
which
judge
saunders
snapped
the
case
of
his
watch
at
the
end
of
every
period
there
was
really
no
hurry
for
the
special
train
which
was
to
bring
them
back
to
dublin
would
certainly
wait
until
they
were
ready
for
it
chesney
felt
aggrieved
at
the
repeated
interruption
and
closed
his
speech
without
giving
the
audience
the
benefit
of
his
peroration
the
judge
came
next
and
began
with
reminding
his
hearers
that
he
was
known
as
an
account
of
the
origin
of
the
name
followed
and
was
enjoyed
even
by
those
who
had
listened
to
the
oratory
before
and
therefore
knew
the
story
there
was
something
piquant
almost
in
the
constant
repetition
of
a
really
wicked
word
like
in
the
halls
of
a
nunnery
the
audience
laughed
reassuringly
and
the
judge
went
on
to
supply
fresh
pabulum
for
mirth
by
suggesting
that
the
reverend
mother
should
clothe
her
nuns
in
their
own
tweeds
he
was
probably
right
in
supposing
that
the
new
costumes
would
add
a
gaiety
to
the
religious
life
other
jests
followed
and
he
sat
down
amid
a
flutter
of
applause
after
promising
that
when
he
next
presided
over
the
winter
assizes
in
a
draughty
he
would
send
for
a
robeen
blanket
and
wrap
his
legs
in
it
clifford
who
followed
the
judge
began
by
wondering
whether
anyone
present
had
ever
been
in
lancashire
after
a
pause
during
which
no
one
owned
to
having
crossed
the
channel
he
said
that
lancashire
was
the
home
of
the
modern
factory
there
every
man
and
woman
earned
good
wages
wore
excellent
clothes
and
lived
in
a
house
fitted
with
hot
and
cold
water
taps
and
a
it
was
his
hope
to
see
mayo
turned
into
another
lancashire
when
ladies
of
undoubted
commercial
ability
like
the
lady
abbess
who
presided
over
the
robeen
convent
lady
abbess
sounded
well
and
clifford
was
not
strong
on
ecclesiastical
titles
took
the
matter
up
success
was
assured
all
that
was
required
for
the
development
of
the
factory
system
in
mayo
was
capital
and
that
the
congested
districts
board
are
in
a
position
to
with
the
help
of
some
prompting
from
davis
he
proceeded
to
lay
before
the
audience
a
few
figures
purporting
to
explain
the
expenditure
professor
cairns
was
evidently
anxious
to
follow
clifford
if
only
in
the
humble
capacity
of
the
proposer
of
a
vote
of
thanks
but
his
name
was
not
on
the
programme
and
chesney
was
already
engaged
in
a
whispered
conversation
with
the
reverend
mother
ignoring
the
professor
almost
rudely
he
announced
that
the
company
in
general
was
invited
to
tea
in
the
the
refreshments
provided
if
not
substantial
were
admirable
in
quality
there
happened
just
then
to
be
a
young
lady
engaged
at
the
expense
of
the
county
council
in
teaching
cookery
in
a
neighbouring
convent
she
was
sent
over
to
robeen
for
the
occasion
and
made
a
number
of
delightful
cakes
at
extremely
small
expense
the
workers
in
the
factory
had
given
the
butter
she
required
as
a
and
the
necessary
eggs
came
from
another
convent
where
the
nuns
with
financial
assistance
from
the
congested
districts
board
kept

the
reverend
mother
dispensed
her
hospitality
with
the
same
air
of
generosity
with
which
clifford
had
spoken
of
providing
capital
for
the
future
ecclesiastical
factories
chapter
xxiii
the
reverend
mother
bowed
out
the
last
of
her
guests
and
retired
to
her
own
room
well
satisfied
she
was
assured
of
further
support
from
the
congested
districts
board
and
certain
debts
which
had
grown
uncomfortably
during
her
struggle
with
quinn
need
trouble
her
no
longer
her
goods
would
be
extensively
advertised
next
morning
in
the
daily
press
her
house
would
obtain
a
celebrity
likely
to
attract
the
most
eligible
novices
those
that
is
to
say
who
would
bring
the
largest
sums
of
money
as
their
dowries
there
arose
before
her
mind
a
vision
of
almost
unbounded
wealth
and
all
that
might
be
done
with
it
what
statues
of
saints
might
not
italy
supply
french
painters
and
german
would
compete
for
the
privilege
of
furnishing
the
chapel
of
her
house
already
she
foresaw
pavements
of
gorgeous
mosaic
windows
radiant
with
munich
glass
and
store
of
vestments
to
make
her
sacristy
famous
grandiose
plans
suggested
themselves
of
founding
daughter
houses
in
melbourne
in
auckland
in
capetown
in
natal
all
things
were
possible
to
a
purse
she
saw
how
her
order
might
open
schools
in
english
towns
where
girls
could
be
taught
french
italian
latin
music
all
the
accomplishments
dear
to
parents
at
ridiculously
low
fees
or
without
fees
at
all
she
stirred
involuntarily
at
the
splendour
of
her
visions
the
weariness
dropped
off
from
her
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
went
into
the
chapel
she
prostrated
herself
before
the
altar
and
lay
passive
in
a
glow
of
warm
emotion
for
god
for
the
mother
of
god
for
the
catholic
church
she
had
laboured
and
suffered
and
dared
now
she
was
well
within
sight
of
the
end
the
golden
reward
the
fulfilment
of
hopes
that
had
never
been
altogether
selfish
her
thoughts
sanctified
now
by
the
presence
on
the
altar
drifted
out
again
on
to
the
shining
sea
of
the
future
what
she
a
humble
nun
had
done
others
would
do
a
countless
army
of
missionary
men
and
women
marching
from
the
irish
shore
would
conquer

conquerors

for
the
church
the
race
once
in
the
far
past
irish
men
and
women
had
christianized
europe
and
ireland
had
won
her
glorious
title
of
now
the
great
day
was
to
dawn
again
the
great
race
to
be
reborn
for
this
end
had
ireland
been
kept
faithful
and
pure
for
centuries
just
that
she
might
be
at
last
the
witness
to
the
spiritual
in
a
materialized
world
for
this
end
had
the
church
in
ireland
gone
through
the
storm
of
persecution
suffered
the
blight
of
the
contempt
that
she
might
emerge
in
the
end
entirely
fitted
for
the
bloodless
warfare

am
one
of

wholly
unlike
the
satisfaction
which
had
flooded
her
in
her
own
room
or
during
the
earlier
ecstasy
before
the
altar
she
raised
her
eyes
slowly
till
they
rested
on
the
shrine
where
the
body
of
the
sacrifice
reposed
viderunt

at
last
she
rose
the
lines
of
care
and
age
gathered
again
upon
her
face
her
eyes
gleamed
with
keen
intelligence
she
braced
herself
with
the
thought
of
all
that
might
still
lie
before
her

of

xxiv
the
reverend
mother
was
not
the
only
person
well
satisfied
with
the
day
the
right
hon
chesney
leant
back
in
his
and
puffed
contentedly
at
his
cigar
it
might
be
his
part
occasionally
indeed
frequently
to
talk
like
a
fool
but
the
man
was
shrewd
enough
it
really
seemed
that
he
had
hit
on
the
true
method
of
governing
ireland
nationalist
members
of
parliament
could
be
muzzled
not
by
the
foolish
old
methods
of
coercion
but
by
winning
the
goodwill
of
the
bishops
no
irish
member
dared
open
his
mouth
when
a
priest
bid
him
keep
it
shut
or
give
a
vote
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
the
hierarchy
and
the
bishops
were
reasonable
men
they
looked
at
things
from
a
point
of
view
intelligible
to
englishmen
there
was
no
ridiculous
sentimentality
about
their
demands
for
so
much
money
they
would
silence
the
clamour
of
the
parliamentary
party
for
so
much
more
they
would
preach
a
modified
loyalty
would
assert
before
the
world
that
the
irish
people
were
faithful
servants
of
the
sovereign
for
a
good
lump
sum
down
they
would
undertake
to
play
save
the
or
on
the
organ
at
maynooth
of
course
the
money
must
be
paid
chesney
was
beginning
to
understand
that
and
felt
the
drawback
it
would
have
been
much
pleasanter
and
simpler
if
the
bishops
would
have
been
content
with
promises
there
was
a
certain
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
necessary
funds
without
announcing
precisely
what
they
were
for
but
after
all
a
man
can
not
be
called
a
great
statesman
without
doing
something
to
deserve
the
title
and
british
statesmanship
is
the
art
of
hoodwinking
the
taxpayer
that
is
all
not
too
difficult
a
task
for
a
clever
man
chesney
reckoned
on
no
power
in
ireland
likely
to
be
seriously
troublesome
the
upper
classes
were
either
helpless
and
sulking
or
helpless
and
smiling
artificially
they
might
grumble
in
private
or
try
to
make
themselves
popular
by
joining
the
chorus
of
the
flatterers
either
way
their
influence
was
inconsiderable
was
there
anyone
else
worth
considering
the
orangemen
were
still
a
noisy
faction
but
their
organization
appeared
to
be
breaking
up
they
were
more
bent
on
devouring
their
own
leaders
than
interfering
with
him
there
were
a
number
of
people
anxious
to
revive
the
irish
language
who
at
one
time
had
caused
him
some
little
uneasiness
he
had
found
it
quite
impossible
to
understand
the
gaelic
league
and
being
an
englishman
arrived
gradually
at
the
comfortable
conclusion
that
what
he
could
not
understand
must
be
foolish
now
he
had
great
hopes
that
the
bishops
might
capture
the
movement
if
once
it
was
safely
under
the
patronage
of
the
church
he
had
nothing
more
to
fear
from
it
no
doubt
resolutions
would
be
passed
but
resolutions
chesney
smiled
there
were
of
course
the
impossible
people
connected
with
the
chesney
did
not
like
them
and
in
the
bottom
of
his
heart
was
a
little
nervous
about
them
they
seemed
to
be
very
little
afraid
of
the
authority
of
the
church
and
he
doubted
if
the
authority
of
the
state
would
frighten
them
at
all
still
there
were
very
few
of
them
and
their
abominable
spirit
of
independence
was
spreading
slowly
if
at
all
he
said
to
himself
of
any
importance
for
some
years
to
come
at
all
events
and
five
years
hence
in
five
years
chesney
hoped
to
be
prime
minister
or
perhaps
to
have
migrated
to
the
house
of
lords
at
least
he
expected
to
be
out
of
ireland
meanwhile
he
lighted
a
fresh
cigar
the
condition
of
the
country
was
extremely
satisfactory
and
his
policy
was
working
out
better
than
he
had
hoped
the
other
travellers
by
the
special
train
were
equally
well
pleased
ireland
so
they
understood
chesney
was
to
be
made
happy
and
contented
peaceful
and
prosperous
it
followed
that
there
must
be
boards
under
the
control
of
dublin
castle
more
and
more
boards
an
endless
procession
of
them
there
is
no
way
devised
by
the
wit
of
man
for
securing
prosperity
and
contentment
except
the
creation
of
boards
if
boards
then
necessarily
officials
officials
with
salaries
and
travelling
allowances
nice
gentlemanly
men
with
villas
at
dalkey
and
killiney
would
perform
duties
not
too
arduous
in
connection
with
the
boards
and
carry
out
the
benevolent
policy
of
the
government
there
was
not
a
man
in
the
train
except
the
newspaper
reporters
who
did
not
believe
in
the
regeneration
of
ireland
by
boards
and
everyone
hoped
to
take
a
share
in
the
good
work
with
the
prospect
of
a
retiring
pension
afterwards
the
local
magnates
with
the
exception
of
sir
gerald
geoghegan
whose
temper
had
been
bad
from
the
first
also
went
home
content
the
minds
of
great
ladies
work
somewhat
confusedly
for
providence
no
doubt
wisely
has
denied
to
most
of
them
the
faculty
of
reason
it
was
enough
for
them
to
feel
that
the
nuns
were
women
and
that
in
some
way
not
very
clear
chesney
was
getting
the
better
of
wretched
only
one
of
all
whom
the
special
train
had
brought
down
failed
to
return
in
it
mary
slipped
out
of
the
convent
before
the
speeches
began
and
wandered
away
towards
the
desolate
stony
hill
where
the
stream
which
turns
the
factory
mill
took
its
rise
it
grieved
her
to
miss
the
cup
of
tea
which
a
friendly
nun
had
led
her
to
expect
but
even
tea
might
be
too
dearly
purchased
and
miss
had
a
strong
dislike
to
listening
to
what
augusta
goold
described
as
the
hypocrisies
of
professional
besides
she
had
her
in
her
pocket
and
a
smoke
unattainable
for
her
in
the
convent
or
the
train
was
much
to
be
desired
she
left
the
road
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
picked
her
way
along
the
rough
bohireen
which
led
upwards
along
the
course
of
the
stream
after
awhile
even
this
track
disappeared
the
stream
tumbled
noisily
over
rocks
and
stones
the
water
glowing
in
the
sunlight
the
ling
and
heather
were
springy
under
her
feet
and
the
air
was
sweet
with
the
scent
of
the
she
spied
round
her
for
a
rock
which
cast
a
shade
upon
the
kind
of
heathery
bed
she
had
set
her
heart
to
find
her
eyes
lit
upon
a
little
party
a
young
man
and
two
girls
encamped
with
a
kettle
a
and
a
store
of
her
renunciation
of
the
convent
tea
had
not
been
made
without
a
pang
she
looked
longingly
at
the
steam
which
already
spouted
from
the
kettle
the
young
man
said
a
few
words
to
the
girls
then
stood
up
raised
his
hat
to
her
and
beckoned
she
approached
him
wondering
it
be
i
really
believe
it
is
miss
it
really
is
myself
hyacinth
dear
boy
you
are
the
last
person
i
expected
to
meet
though
of
course
i
knew
you
were
somewhere
down
in
these
and
have
some
tea
said
hyacinth
let
me
introduce
you
to
miss
beecher
and
miss
elsie
miss
took
stock
of
the
two
girls
make
their
own
clothes
she
thought
apparently
only
see
last
the
eldest
how
is
it
all
west
of
ireland
girls
have
such
glorious
complexions
her
figure
be
bad
if
her
mother
bought
her
a
decent
pair
of
stays
i
wonder
who
they
are
and
what
they
are
doing
here
with
hyacinth
they
be
his
while
they
drank
their
tea
certain
glances
and
smiles
gave
her
an
inkling
of
the
truth
suppose
hyacinth
is
engaged
to
the
elder
one
she
concluded
kind
of
girl
dare
to
make
eyes
at
a
man
unless
she
had
some
kind
of
right
to
after
tea
she
produced
her
hope
you
mind
she
said
to
marion
know
very
shocking
but
had
a
tiring
day
and
an
excellent
tea
and
oh
this
heather
is
delicious
to
lie
on
she
stretched
herself
at
full
length
as
she
spoke
really
must
smoke
just
to
arrive
at
perfect
felicity
for
once
in
my
life
how
happy
you
people
ought
to
be
who
always
have
in
a
place
like
this
said
marion
sometimes
rains
you
and
then
these
sweet
spots
get
boggy
i
suppose
and
you
have
to
wear
thick
clumping
her
own
were
very
neat
and
small
and
she
knew
that
they
must
obtrude
themselves
on
the
eye
while
she
lay
prone
elsie
whose
shoes
were
patched
as
well
as
made
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
cover
them
with
her
skirt
said
hyacinth
us
what
you
are
doing
down
here
they
made
you
an
inspectress
of
workhouse
children
have
they
or
sent
you
down
to
improve
the
breed
of
hens
said
miss
have
spent
the
afternoon
helping
to
govern
marion
and
elsie
gazed
at
her
in
wonder
a
lady
who
smoked
cigarettes
and
bore
the
cares
of
state
upon
her
shoulders
was
a
novelty
to
them
have
sat
in
the
seats
of
the
mighty
she
said
have
breathed
the
same
air
as
chesney
and
two
members
of
the
think
of
that
moreover
i
might
if
i
liked
have
drunk
tea
with
a
said
hyacinth
were
at
the
convent
function
i
suppose
i
wonder
i
see
on
earth
were
doing
there
i
thought
you
hated
the
nuns
and
all
their
on
about
yourself
said
hyacinth
are
not
employed
by
the
government
to
inspect
infant
industries
are
you
no
i
was
one
of
the
representatives
of
the
press
i
have
notes
here
of
all
the
beautiful
clothes
worn
by
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
west
british
aristocracy
listen
to
this
geoghegan
was
gowned
in
an
important
creation
of
saffron
tweed
the
product
of
the
convent
looms
we
are
much
mistaken
if
this
fabric
in
just
this
shade
is
not
destined
to
play
a
part
in
robing
the
who
will
shed
a
lustre
on
our
during
the
and
this
you
must
just
listen
to
said
hyacinth
can
if
you
like
marion
shut
my
well
said
miss
talk
seriously
when
are
you
coming
up
to
dublin
you
know
my
brother
has
taken
over
the
editorship
of
the
we
are
going
to
make
it
a
great
power
in
the
country
we
are
coming
out
with
a
policy
which
will
sweep
the
old
set
of
political
talkers
out
of
existence
and
clear
the
country
of
chesney
and
the
likes
of
she
waved
her
hand
towards
the
convent
it
is
going
to
be
great
it
is
great
already
why
you
come
and
help
us
hyacinth
looked
at
her
she
had
half
risen
and
leaned
upon
her
elbow
her
face
was
flushed
and
her
eyes
sparkled
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
genuineness
of
her
enthusiasm
the
words
of
her
poem
long
since
he
supposed
blotted
from
his
memory
suddenly
returned
to
him
desolate
mother
o
erin
when
shall
the
pulse
of
thy
life
which
but
flutters
in
connacht
throb
through
thy
meadows
and
boglands
and
mountains
and
cities
had
it
come
at
last
this
revival
of
the
vitality
had
it
come
just
too
late
for
him
to
share
it
shall
not
help
you
he
said
sadly
do
not
suppose
that
i
ever
could
have
helped
you
much
but
now
i
shall
not
even
she
looked
at
him
quickly
with
a
startled
expression
in
her
eyes
then
she
turned
to
marion
you
preventing
him
she
said
said
hyacinth
is
not
marion
but
i
am
going
away
going
to
england
i
am
going
to
be
ordained
to
become
an
english
curate
do
you
understand
i
came
here
to
see
the
man
who
is
to
be
my
rector
and
to
make
final
arrangements
with
hyacinth
for
some
minutes
she
said
no
more
he
saw
in
her
face
a
wondering
sorrow
a
pathetic
submissiveness
to
an
unexpected
disappointment
like
the
look
in
the
face
of
a
dog
struck
suddenly
by
the
hand
of
a
friend
he
felt
that
he
could
have
borne
her
anger
better
no
doubt
if
he
had
made
his
confession
to
augusta
goold
he
would
have
been
overwhelmed
with
passionate
wrath
or
withered
by
a
superb
contemptuous
stare
then
he
could
have
worked
himself
to
anger
in
return
but
this
will
never
speak
to
any
of
us
again
she
went
on
you
will
be
ashamed
even
to
read
the
you
will
wear
a
long
black
coat
and
gray
gloves
you
will
learn
to
talk
about
the
and
the
inestimable
advantages
of
belonging
to
a
empire
and
about
the
great
heart
of
the
english
people
i
see
it
all
all
that
will
happen
to
you
your
hair
will
get
quite
smooth
and
sleek
then
you
will
become
a
vicar
of
a
parish
you
will
live
in
a
beautiful
house
with
virginia
creeper
growing
over
it
and
in
the
garden
you
will
have
a
nice
clean
village
for
a
parish
with
old
women
who
drop
curtsies
to
you
and
men
such
men
stupid
as
bullocks
i
know
it
all
and
you
will
be
ashamed
to
call
yourself
an
irishman
oh
hyacinth
miss
catalogue
of
catastrophes
was
curiously
mixed
perhaps
the
comedy
in
it
tended
to
obscure
the
utter
degradation
of
the
ruin
she
described
but
the
freakish
incongruity
of
the
speech
did
not
strike
hyacinth
he
found
in
it
only
two
notes
pity
that
such
a
fate
awaited
him
and
contempt
for
the
man
who
submitted
to
it
can
not
help
myself
will
you
not
make
an
effort
to
understand
i
am
trying
to
do
what
is
she
shook
her
head
he
said
know
it
is
no
use
you
could
not
understand
even
if
i
told
you
all
i
her
eyes
filled
suddenly
with
tears
he
heard
her
sob
then
she
turned
without
a
word
and
left
them
he
stood
watching
her
till
she
reached
the
road
and
started
on
her
walk
to
the
then
he
took
two
hands
in
his
and
held
them
fast
understand
he
asked
her
she
looked
up
at
him
her
face
was
all
tenderness
love
shone
on
him
trusting
unquestioning
adoring
love
love
that
would
be
loyal
to
the
uttermost
but
her
eyes
were
full
of
a
dumb
wonder

one
morning
near
the
end
of
september
the
published
a
list
of
irish
graduates
ordained
in

on
the

sunday
among

across
the
low

curragh
from
the

drifting
driving
sweeps
the
rain
where
the

bent
brown
rushes
grow
for
me
barren

instead
of

across
the
sad
soaked
curragh
towards
the

striding
striving
go
the
men
with
their
spades
and
forks
and
barrows
toil
for
me
that
my
corn
may
grow
again

safe
from

hyacinth
read
the
verses
cut
them
out
of
the
and
locked
them
in
the
box
in
which
he
stored
the
few
papers
of
interest
he
possessed
the
sorrowful
judgment
pronounced
on
his
conduct
affected
him
but
only
in
a
dull
way
like
an
additional
blow
upon
a
limb
already
bruised
to
numbness
he
accepted
his
new
duties
and
performed
them
without
any
feeling
of
enthusiasm
and
after
a
little
while
without
any
definite
hope
of
doing
any
good
he
got
no
further
in
understanding
the
people
he
had
to
deal
with
and
he
was
aware
that
even
those
of
them
who
came
most
frequently
into
contact
with
him
regarded
him
as
a
stranger
a
young
doctor
whose
wife
took
a
fancy
to
marion
tried
to
make
friends
with
him
the
result
was
unsatisfactory
owing
to
irresponsiveness
he
could
not
without
yawning
piteously
spend
an
evening
discussing
the
performances
of
the
local
cricket
club
nor
did
his
conduct
improve
when
the
two
ladies
suspended
their
talk
and
sacrificed
an
hour
to
playing
halma
with
their
husbands
an
unmarried
solicitor
attracted
by
beauty
and
friendliness
adopted
the
habit
of
calling
at
little
house
about
nine
or
ten
in
the
evening
he
was
a
man
full
of
anecdote
and
simple
mirth
and
he
often
stayed
quite
happily
till
midnight
every
week
he
brought
an
illustrated
paper
as
an
offering
to
marion
and
recommended
the
short
stories
in
it
to
her
notice
he
often
asked
advice
and
help
in
solving
the
conundrums
set
by
the
prize
editor
he
took
a
mild
interest
in
politics
and
retailed
gossip
picked
up
at
the
conservative
club
after
a
while
he
gave
up
coming
to
the
house
hyacinth
blamed
himself
for
being
cold
and
unfriendly
to
the
man
austin
treated
hyacinth
with
kindness
and
some
consideration
much
as
a
wise
master
treats
an
upper
servant
he
was
anxious
that
his
curate
should
perform
many
and
complicated
ceremonies
in
church
was
seriously
intent
on
the
wearing
of
stoles
and
as
he
expressed
it
himself
a
very
large
number
of
different
organizations
of
each
of
which
the
objective
appeared
to
be
a
in
the
parochial
hall
hyacinth
accepted
his
tuition
bowed
low
at
the
times
when
austin
liked
to
bow
watched
for
the
seasons
when
stoles
bloomed
white
and
gold
changed
to
green
or
faded
down
to
violet
he
tried
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
the
and
the
rest
when
they
assembled
for
austin
asserted
that
these
were
the
methods
by
which
the
english
people
were
being
taught
the
catholic
faith
hyacinth
did
not
doubt
it
nor
did
he
permit
himself
to
wonder
whether
it
was
worth
while
teaching
them
to
marion
the
new
life
was
full
of
many
delights
the
surpliced
gratified
her
aesthetic
sense
and
she
entered
herself
as
one
of
a
band
of
volunteers
who
scrubbed
the
chancel
tiles
and
polished
a
brass
cross
she
smiled
kissed
and
petted
hyacinth
out
of
the
fits
of
depression
which
came
on
him
managed
his
small
income
with
wonderful
skill
and
wrote
immensely
long
letters
home
to
ballymoy
chapter
xxvi
it
is
very
hard
for
a
poor
man
to
travel
from
one
side
of
england
to
the
other
side
of
ireland
because
railway
companies
even
when
to
allure
the
public
they
advertise
extraordinary
excursions
charge
a
great
deal
for
their
tickets
the
journey
becomes
still
more
difficult
of
accomplishment
when
the
poor
man
is
married
then
there
are
two
tickets
to
be
bought
and
very
likely
most
of
the
money
which
might
have
bought
them
has
been
spent
securing
the
safe
arrival
of
a
baby
a
third
person
who
in
due
time
will
also
require
a
this
was
case
for
two
summers
he
had
no
holiday
at
all
and
it
was
only
by
the
most
fortunate
of
chances
that
he
found
himself
during
the
third
summer
in
a
position
to
go
to
ballymoy
he
sublet
his
house
to
a
supervisor
of
inland
revenue
who
wanted
six
weeks
to
look
about
for
a
suitable
residence
with
the
nine
pounds
paid
in
advance
by
this
gentleman
hyacinth
and
marion
having
with
them
their
baby
a
perambulator
and
much
other
luggage
set
off
for
ballymoy
the
journey
is
not
a
very
pleasant
one
because
it
is
made
over
the
lines
of
three
english
railway
companies
whose
trains
refuse
to
connect
with
each
other
at
junctions
and
because
channel
is
generally
rough
the
discomfort
of
carriages
is
more
acutely
felt
when
the
irish
shore
is
reached
but
the
misery
of
having
to
feed
and
tend
a
child
lasts
the
whole
journey
through
therefore
marion
arrived
in
dublin
dishevelled
weary
and
for
all
her
natural
placidness
inclined
to
be
cross
the
steamer
came
to
port
at
an
hour
which
left
them
just
the
faint
hope
of
catching
the
earliest
train
to
ballymoy
disappointment
followed
the
nervous
strain
of
a
rush
across
dublin
two
long
hours
intervened
before
the
next
train
started
and
the
people
who
keep
the
in
broadstone
station
are
not
early
risers
marion
without
tea
or
courage
settled
herself
and
the
baby
in
the
draughty
hyacinth
was
also
dishevelled
dirty
and
tired
having
borne
his
full
share
of
strife
with
the
worst
moods
but
the
sight
of
ireland
from
the
deck
filled
him
with
a
strange
sense
of
exultation
he
wished
to
shout
with
gladness
when
the
gray
dome
of
the
custom
house
rose
to
view
immense
above
the
low
blanket
of
mist
even
the
incredibly
hideous
iron
grating
of
the
railway
viaduct
set
his
pulse
beating
joyfully
he
drew
deep
breaths
inhaling
various
abominable
smells
delightedly
the
voices
of
the
sleepy
porters
on
the
quay
roused
in
him
a
craving
for
the
gentle
slovenliness
of
irish
speech
he
fussed
and
hustled
marion
beyond
the
limits
of
her
endurance
pretending
eagerness
to
catch
the
early
train
caring
in
reality
not
at
all
whether
any
train
were
caught
or
missed
filled
only
with
a
kind
of
frenzy
to
keep
moving
somehow
further
into
ireland
in
the
cab
he
gave
utterance
to
ridiculous
pleasantries
he
seized
the
child
from
marion
and
held
him
wailing
piteously
half
out
of
the
window
that
his
eyes
might
rest
on
the
great
gilt
characters
which
adorn
the
offices
of
the
gaelic
league
it
was
with
rapture
that
he
read
irish
names
written
and
spelt
in
irish
above
the
shops
and
saw
a
banner
proclaiming
the
annual
festival
of
irish
ireland
hanging
over
the
door
of
the
rotunda
the
city
had
grown
more
irish
since
he
left
it
there
was
no
possibility
now
even
in
the
early
morning
with
few
people
but
scavengers
and
milkmen
in
the
streets
of
mistaking
for
an
english
town
while
marion
sat
torpid
in
the
he
paced
the
platform
eagerly
from
end
to
end
he
saw
the
train
pushed
slowly
into
position
beside
the
platform
watched
porters
sweep
the
accumulated
débris
of
traffic
from
the
floors
of
the
carriages
and
rub
with
filthy
rags
the
brass
doorhandles
little
groups
of
passengers
began
to
arrive
first
a
company
of
four
of
them
men
with
keen
crafty
eyes
bound
for
some
western
fair
then
a
laughing
party
of
tourists
women
in
short
skirts
and
exaggeratedly
protective
veils
men
with
fierce
tweed
knickerbockers
dragging
stuffed
and
yellow
bags
these
were
evidently
english
their
clear
voices
proclaimed
contempt
for
their
surroundings
and
left
no
doubt
of
their
nationality
one
of
them
addressed
a
bewildered
porter
in
cheerful
song
you
right
there
michael
are
you
right
have
you
got
the
parcel
there
for
white
he
felt
and
his
companions
sympathized
that
he
was
entering
into
the
spirit
of
irish
life
then
heralded
by
an
obsequious
guard
came
a
great
man
proconsular
in
mien
and
gait
bags
and
rugs
were
wheeled
beside
him
in
his
hand
was
a
bearing
the
tremendous
initials
of
the
local
government
board
he
took
complete
possession
of
a
smoking
carriage
scribbled
a
telegram
perhaps
of
international
importance
handed
it
to
the
guard
for
instant
despatch
and
lit
a
cigar
hyacinth
humbled
by
the
mere
view
of
this
incarnation
of
the
imperial
spirit
went
meekly
to
the
to
fetch
marion
and
his
child
he
led
them
across
the
now
crowded
platform
towards
a
carriage
will
not
go
with
you
in
your
carriage
father
lavelle
so
flat
nor
i
split
the
difference
and
go
second
either
if
what
going
to
propose
to
me
is
it
spend
what
would
keep
the
family
of
a
poor
man
in
bread
and
tea
for
a
week
for
the
sake
of
easing
my
back
with
a
cushion
get
away
with
you
the
plain
deal
good
enough
for
me
and
moreover
i
doubt
very
much
if
the
money
to
do
it
if
i
were
ever
so
willing
afraid
to
look
into
my
purse
to
count
the
few
coppers
left
in
it
after
paying
that
murdering
bill
in
the
hotel
you
took
me
to
gresham
indeed
a
place
where
not
ashamed
to
charge
a
poor
old
priest
three
and
sixpence
for
his
breakfast
and
me
not
able
to
eat
the
half
of
what
they
put
before
hyacinth
turned
quickly
two
priests
stood
together
near
the
bookstall
the
one
a
young
man
handsome
and
he
did
not
know
the
other
he
recognised
at
once
it
seemed
to
be
the
same
familiarly
shabby
black
coat
which
he
wore
the
same
waistcoat
the
identical
silk
hat
ruffled
and
the
same
pads
of
flesh
hung
flaccid
from
his
jaws
the
red
cracked
knuckles
of
his
hands
well
remembered
were
enormous
still
only
the
furrows
on
the
face
seemed
to
be
ploughed
deeper
and
wider
and
a
few
more
stiff
hairs
curled
over
the
general
bushiness
of
the
grizzled
eyebrows
moran
cried
hyacinth
am
father
moran
right
there
but
who
are
or
how
you
come
to
know
me
is
more
than
i
can
tell
but
wait
a
minute
a
sort
of
recollection
of
your
voice
will
you
speak
to
me
again
and
maybe
be
able
to
put
a
name
on
hyacinth
said
a
few
words
rapidly
in
irish
have
you
now
said
the
priest
hyacinth
conneally
the
boy
that
went
out
to
fight
for
the
boers
father
lavelle
this
is
a
friend
of
mine
that
known
ever
since
he
was
born
and
i
laid
eyes
on
him
these
six
years
or
more
going
west
conneally
but
of
course
you
are
where
else
would
you
be
going
travel
together
and
talk
if
going
father
lavelle
will
have
to
lend
me
the
money
to
pay
the
extra
on
my
ticket
so
as
i
can
go
with
you
seemingly
a
protestant
minister
grown
into
well
now
have
thought
it
and
you
so
set
on
fighting
the
battle
of
armageddon
and
all
a
for
you
so
it
is
but
never
mind
you
might
have
got
yourself
killed
in
it
many
a
one
killed
or
maimed
for
life
in
smaller
fights
than
it
better
to
be
a
minister
any
day
than
a
corpse
or
a
cripple
and
as
you
are
a
minister
likely
to
be
travelling
times
are
changed
since
i
was
young
it
was
the
priests
travelled
then
if
they
travelled
at
all
and
the
ministers
were
cocked
up
on
the
cushions
looking
down
on
the
likes
of
us
out
of
the
windows
with
the
little
red
curtains
across
them
now
be
father
lavelle
there
with
his
grand
new
coat
that
he
says
is
irish
manufacture
but
i
believe
him
be
doing
the
gentleman
but
come
along
conneally
come
along
and
tell
me
all
the
battles
you
fought
and
the
generals
you
made
prisoners
of
and
how
it
was
you
took
to
preaching
hyacinth
somewhat
shyly
introduced
the
priest
to
marion
then
a
drove
them
into
their
carriage
and
locked
the
door
father
moran
began
to
catechize
hyacinth
before
the
train
started
and
drew
from
him
as
they
went
westwards
the
story
of
his
disappointments
doubts
hopes
veerings
and
final
despair
hyacinth
spoke
unwillingly
at
first
giving
no
more
than
necessary
answers
to
the
questions
then
because
he
found
that
reticence
called
down
on
him
fresh
and
more
detailed
inquiries
and
also
because
the
evident
and
sympathetic
interest
redeemed
a
prying
curiosity
from
offensiveness
he
told
his
tale
more
freely
very
soon
there
was
no
more
need
of
questioning
and
father
share
in
the
talk
took
the
form
of
comments
interrupting
a
narrative
of
captain
albert
quinn
he
said
heard
of
him
and
a
nice
kind
of
a
boy
he
seems
to
have
been
i
suppose
he
fought
when
he
got
there
just
the
sort
that
would
be
splendid
at
the
fighting
well
god
is
good
and
i
suppose
to
do
the
fighting
for
the
rest
of
us
that
he
makes
the
likes
of
captain
quinn
did
you
hear
that
they
wanted
to
make
him
a
member
of
parliament
well
they
did
nothing
less
would
please
them
but
what
good
would
that
be
when
he
set
foot
in
the
country
for
fear
of
being
arrested
later
on
he
was
moved
to
laughter
think
of
your
going
on
the
road
with
a
bag
full
of
blankets
and
shawls
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
and
all
the
grand
notions
your
head
was
full
of
why
you
come
my
way
have
made
rafferty
give
you
an
order
have
bought
the
makings
of
a
frieze
coat
from
you
myself
i
would
afterwards
he
became
grave
again
let
you
say
the
hard
word
about
the
nuns
conneally
do
it
now
plenty
of
good
convents
up
and
down
through
the
country
more
than
ever
know
of
being
the
black
protestant
you
are
and
the
ones
that
ruined
your
business
supposing
they
did
ruin
it
and
only
your
word
for
that
what
right
have
you
to
be
blaming
them
they
were
trying
to
turn
an
honest
penny
by
an
honest
trade
and
just
what
you
and
your
friend
quinn
were
doing
hyacinth
conscious
of
a
failure
in
good
taste
shifted
his
ground
only
to
be
interrupted
again
you
may
abuse
the
congested
districts
board
to
your
content
i
never
could
see
what
the
government
made
all
the
boards
for
unless
it
was
to
keep
the
people
out
of
mischief
as
long
as
there
is
a
board
of
any
kind
about
the
country
every
blackguard
will
be
so
busy
throwing
stones
at
it
that
he
have
time
nor
inclination
left
to
annoy
decent
people
and
say
this
for
the
congested
districts
board
they
mean
well
indeed
they
do
not
a
doubt
of
it
one
good
thing
they
did
anyway
if
there
another
and
when
they
came
to
carrowkeel
and
bought
the
big
curragh
farm
that
never
supported
a
christian
but
two
herds
and
some
bullocks
ever
since
the
famine
clearances
they
fetched
the
people
down
off
the
mountains
and
put
them
on
it
that
a
good
thing
now
sure
all
government
boards
do
more
wrong
than
right
the
nature
of
that
sort
of
confederation
but
all
the
more
thankful
we
ought
to
be
when
once
in
a
while
they
do
something
hyacinth
came
to
tell
of
the
choice
which
canon
beecher
offered
him
and
dwelt
with
tragic
emphasis
on
his
own
decision
the
priest
listened
a
smile
on
his
lips
a
look
of
pity
which
belied
the
smile
in
his
eyes
you
thought
ireland
would
be
lost
altogether
unless
you
wrote
articles
for
miss
goold
in
the
no
small
opinion
you
have
of
yourself
hyacinth
conneally
and
you
thought
save
your
soul
by
going
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
english
people
was
that
it
now
was
not
said
hyacinth
you
know
it
course
it
what
was
i
thinking
of
to
forget
the
young
lady
that
was
in
it
a
fine
wife
got
any
way
god
bless
her
and
make
you
a
good
husband
to
her
by
the
looks
of
her
better
than
you
deserve
i
suppose
it
was
to
get
money
you
went
to
england
so
as
to
buy
her
pretty
dresses
and
a
beautiful
house
to
live
in
did
you
think
grow
rich
over
there
i
did
not
said
hyacinth
bitterly
knew
never
be
then
you
as
well
have
been
poor
in
ireland
and
better
for
poor
here
but
there
i
know
well
enough
it
money
you
were
after
be
getting
angry
with
me
now
it
for
the
sake
of
saving
your
soul
you
went
nor
to
get
your
nice
wife
though
a
man
might
go
a
long
way
for
the
likes
of
her
i
know
why
you
went
and
my
belief
you
know
yourself
but
you
made
a
mistake
whatever
you
did
it
for
going
off
on
that
english
mission
is
it
a
mission
you
call
it
when
a
protestant
i
think
it
is
but
it
matter
you
made
a
mistake
why
you
come
back
again
knows
i
would
if
i
could
hungry
i
am
to
get
back
just
sick
with
hunger
and
the
great
desire
that
is
on
me
to
be

desolate
to
them

went
scouring
and
scraping
round
the
four

him

doubtfully
at

quiet
in
