hodgson
people
may
say
thou
art
no
longer
young
and
yet
to
me
thy
youth
was
yesterday
a
yesterday
that
seems
still
mingled
with
my
dreams
ah
how
the
years
have
thee
flung
their
soft
mantilla
grey
and
to
them
thou
art
not
over
old
how
thou
be
thy
hair
hast
scarcely
lost
its
deep
old
glorious
dark
thy
face
is
scarcely
lined
no
mark
destroys
its
calm
serenity
like
gold
of
evening
light
when
winds
scarce
stir
the
of
thy
face
is
pure
as
prayer
i
the
land
of
lonesomeness
now
we
had
been
five
days
in
the
boats
and
in
all
this
time
made
no
discovering
of
land
then
upon
the
morning
of
the
sixth
day
came
there
a
cry
from
the
who
had
the
command
of
the
lifeboat
that
there
was
something
which
might
be
land
afar
upon
our
larboard
bow
but
it
was
very
low
lying
and
none
could
tell
whether
it
was
land
or
but
a
morning
cloud
yet
because
there
was
the
beginning
of
hope
within
our
hearts
we
pulled
wearily
towards
it
and
thus
in
about
an
hour
discovered
it
to
be
indeed
the
coast
of
some
flat
country
then
it
might
be
a
little
after
the
hour
of
midday
we
had
come
so
close
to
it
that
we
could
distinguish
with
ease
what
manner
of
land
lay
beyond
the
shore
and
thus
we
found
it
to
be
of
an
abominable
flatness
desolate
beyond
all
that
i
could
have
imagined
here
and
there
it
appeared
to
be
covered
with
clumps
of
queer
vegetation
though
whether
they
were
small
trees
or
great
bushes
i
had
no
means
of
telling
but
this
i
know
that
they
were
like
unto
nothing
which
ever
i
had
set
eyes
upon
before
so
much
as
this
i
gathered
as
we
pulled
slowly
along
the
coast
seeking
an
opening
whereby
we
could
pass
inward
to
the
land
but
a
weary
time
passed
or
ere
we
came
upon
that
which
we
sought
yet
in
the
end
we
found
it
a
creek
which
proved
to
be
the
estuary
of
a
great
river
though
we
spoke
of
it
always
as
a
creek
into
this
we
entered
and
proceeded
at
no
great
pace
upwards
along
its
winding
course
and
as
we
made
forward
we
scanned
the
low
banks
upon
each
side
perchance
there
might
be
some
spot
where
we
could
make
to
land
but
we
found
none
the
banks
being
composed
of
a
vile
mud
which
gave
us
no
encouragement
to
venture
rashly
upon
them
now
having
taken
the
boat
something
over
a
mile
up
the
great
creek
we
came
upon
the
first
of
that
vegetation
which
i
had
chanced
to
notice
from
the
sea
and
here
being
within
some
score
yards
of
it
we
were
the
better
able
to
study
it
thus
i
found
that
it
was
indeed
composed
largely
of
a
sort
of
tree
very
low
and
stunted
and
having
what
might
be
described
as
an
unwholesome
look
about
it
the
branches
of
this
tree
i
perceived
to
be
the
cause
of
my
inability
to
recognize
it
from
a
bush
until
i
had
come
close
upon
it
for
they
grew
thin
and
smooth
through
all
their
length
and
hung
towards
the
earth
being
weighted
thereto
by
a
single
large
plant
which
seemed
to
sprout
from
the
extreme
tip
of
each
presently
having
passed
beyond
this
clump
of
the
vegetation
and
the
banks
of
the
river
remaining
very
low
i
stood
me
upon
a
thwart
by
which
means
i
was
enabled
to
scan
the
surrounding
country
this
i
discovered
so
far
as
my
sight
could
penetrate
to
be
pierced
in
all
directions
with
innumerable
creeks
and
pools
some
of
these
latter
being
very
great
of
extent
and
as
i
have
before
made
mention
everywhere
the
country
was
low
set
as
it
might
be
a
great
plain
of
mud
so
that
it
gave
me
a
sense
of
dreariness
to
look
out
upon
it
it
may
be
all
unconsciously
that
my
spirit
was
put
in
awe
by
the
extreme
silence
of
all
the
country
around
for
in
all
that
waste
i
could
see
no
living
thing
neither
bird
nor
vegetable
save
it
be
the
stunted
trees
which
indeed
grew
in
clumps
here
and
there
over
all
the
land
so
much
as
i
could
see
this
silence
when
i
grew
fully
aware
of
it
was
the
more
uncanny
for
my
memory
told
me
that
never
before
had
i
come
upon
a
country
which
contained
so
much
quietness
nothing
moved
across
my
vision
not
even
a
lone
bird
soared
up
against
the
dull
sky
and
for
my
hearing
not
so
much
as
the
cry
of
a
came
to
me
no
nor
the
croak
of
a
frog
nor
the
plash
of
a
fish
it
was
as
though
we
had
come
upon
the
country
of
silence
which
some
have
called
the
land
of
lonesomeness
now
three
hours
had
passed
whilst
we
ceased
not
to
labor
at
the
oars
and
we
could
no
more
see
the
sea
yet
no
place
fit
for
our
feet
had
come
to
view
for
everywhere
the
mud
grey
and
black
surrounded
us
encompassing
us
veritably
by
a
slimy
wilderness
and
so
we
were
fain
to
pull
on
in
the
hope
that
we
might
come
ultimately
to
firm
ground
then
a
little
before
sundown
we
halted
upon
our
oars
and
made
a
scant
meal
from
a
portion
of
our
remaining
provisions
and
as
we
ate
i
could
see
the
sun
sinking
away
over
the
wastes
and
i
had
some
slight
diversion
in
watching
the
grotesque
shadows
which
it
cast
from
the
trees
into
the
water
upon
our
larboard
side
for
we
had
come
to
a
pause
opposite
a
clump
of
the
vegetation
it
was
at
this
time
as
i
remember
that
it
was
borne
in
upon
me
afresh
how
very
silent
was
the
land
and
that
this
was
not
due
to
my
imagination
i
remarked
that
the
men
both
in
our
own
and
in
the
boat
seemed
uneasy
because
of
it
for
none
spoke
save
in
undertones
as
though
they
had
fear
of
breaking
it
and
it
was
at
this
time
when
i
was
awed
by
so
much
solitude
that
there
came
the
first
telling
of
life
in
all
that
wilderness
i
heard
it
first
in
the
far
distance
away
inland
a
curious
low
sobbing
note
it
was
and
the
rise
and
the
fall
of
it
was
like
to
the
sobbing
of
a
lonesome
wind
through
a
great
forest
yet
was
there
no
wind
then
in
a
moment
it
had
died
and
the
silence
of
the
land
was
awesome
by
reason
of
the
contrast
and
i
looked
about
me
at
the
men
both
in
the
boat
in
which
i
was
and
that
which
the
commanded
and
not
one
was
there
but
held
himself
in
a
posture
of
listening
in
this
wise
a
minute
of
quietness
passed
and
then
one
of
the
men
gave
out
a
laugh
born
of
the
nervousness
which
had
taken
him
the
muttered
to
him
to
hush
and
in
the
same
moment
there
came
again
the
plaint
of
that
wild
sobbing
and
abruptly
it
sounded
away
on
our
right
and
immediately
was
caught
up
as
it
were
and
echoed
back
from
some
place
beyond
us
afar
up
the
creek
at
that
i
got
me
upon
a
thwart
intending
to
take
another
look
over
the
country
about
us
but
the
banks
of
the
creek
had
become
higher
moreover
the
vegetation
acted
as
a
screen
even
had
my
stature
and
elevation
enabled
me
to
overlook
the
banks
and
so
after
a
little
while
the
crying
died
away
and
there
was
another
silence
then
as
we
sat
each
one
harking
for
what
might
next
befall
george
the
youngest
boy
who
had
his
seat
beside
me
plucked
me
by
the
sleeve
inquiring
in
a
troubled
voice
whether
i
had
any
knowledge
of
that
which
the
crying
might
portend
but
i
shook
my
head
telling
him
that
i
had
no
knowing
beyond
his
own
though
for
his
comfort
i
said
that
it
might
be
the
wind
yet
at
that
he
shook
his
head
for
indeed
it
was
plain
that
it
could
not
be
by
such
agency
for
there
was
a
stark
calm
now
i
had
scarce
made
an
end
of
my
remark
when
again
the
sad
crying
was
upon
us
it
appeared
to
come
from
far
up
the
creek
and
from
far
down
the
creek
and
from
inland
and
the
land
between
us
and
the
sea
it
filled
the
evening
air
with
its
doleful
wailing
and
i
remarked
that
there
was
in
it
a
curious
sobbing
most
human
in
its
despairful
crying
and
so
awesome
was
the
thing
that
no
man
of
us
spoke
for
it
seemed
that
we
harked
to
the
weeping
of
lost
souls
and
then
as
we
waited
fearfully
the
sun
sank
below
the
edge
of
the
world
and
the
dusk
was
upon
us
and
now
a
more
extraordinary
thing
happened
for
as
the
night
fell
with
swift
gloom
the
strange
wailing
and
crying
was
hushed
and
another
sound
stole
out
upon
the
land
a
far
sullen
growling
at
the
first
like
the
crying
it
came
from
far
inland
but
was
caught
up
speedily
on
all
sides
of
us
and
presently
the
dark
was
full
of
it
and
it
increased
in
volume
and
strange
trumpetings
fled
across
it
then
though
with
slowness
it
fell
away
to
a
low
continuous
growling
and
in
it
there
was
that
which
i
can
only
describe
as
an
insistent
hungry
snarl
aye
no
other
word
of
which
i
have
knowledge
so
well
describes
it
as
that
a
note
of
most
awesome
to
the
ear
and
this
more
than
all
the
rest
of
those
incredible
voicings
brought
terror
into
my
heart
now
as
i
sat
listening
george
gripped
me
suddenly
by
the
arm
declaring
in
a
shrill
whisper
that
something
had
come
among
the
clump
of
trees
upon
the
bank
of
the
truth
of
this
i
had
immediately
a
proof
for
i
caught
the
sound
of
a
continuous
rustling
among
them
and
then
a
nearer
note
of
growling
as
though
a
wild
beast
purred
at
my
elbow
immediately
upon
this
i
caught
the
voice
calling
in
a
low
tone
to
josh
the
eldest
who
had
the
charge
of
our
boat
to
come
alongside
of
him
for
he
would
have
the
boats
together
then
got
we
out
the
oars
and
laid
the
boats
together
in
the
midst
of
the
creek
and
so
we
watched
through
the
night
being
full
of
fear
so
that
we
kept
our
speech
low
that
is
so
low
as
would
carry
our
thoughts
one
to
the
other
through
the
noise
of
the
growling
and
so
the
hours
passed
and
naught
happened
more
than
i
have
told
save
that
once
a
little
after
midnight
the
trees
opposite
to
us
seemed
to
be
stirred
again
as
though
some
creature
or
creatures
lurked
among
them
and
there
came
a
little
after
that
a
sound
as
of
something
stirring
the
water
up
against
the
bank
but
it
ceased
in
a
while
and
the
silence
fell
once
more
thus
after
a
weariful
time
away
eastwards
the
sky
began
to
tell
of
the
coming
of
the
day
and
as
the
light
grew
and
strengthened
so
did
that
insatiable
growling
pass
hence
with
the
dark
and
the
shadows
and
so
at
last
came
the
day
and
once
more
there
was
borne
to
us
the
sad
wailing
that
had
preceded
the
night
for
a
certain
while
it
lasted
rising
and
falling
most
mournfully
over
the
vastness
of
the
surrounding
wastes
until
the
sun
was
risen
some
degrees
above
the
horizon
after
which
it
began
to
fail
dying
away
in
lingering
echoes
most
solemn
to
our
ears
and
so
it
passed
and
there
came
again
the
silence
that
had
been
with
us
in
all
the
daylight
hours
now
it
being
day
the
bade
us
make
such
sparse
breakfast
as
our
provender
allowed
after
which
having
first
scanned
the
banks
to
discern
if
any
fearful
thing
were
visible
we
took
again
to
our
oars
and
proceeded
on
our
upward
journey
for
we
hoped
presently
to
come
upon
a
country
where
life
had
not
become
extinct
and
where
we
could
put
foot
to
honest
earth
yet
as
i
have
made
mention
earlier
the
vegetation
where
it
grew
did
flourish
most
luxuriantly
so
that
i
am
scarce
correct
when
i
speak
of
life
as
being
extinct
in
that
land
for
indeed
now
i
think
of
it
i
can
remember
that
the
very
mud
from
which
it
sprang
seemed
veritably
to
have
a
fat
sluggish
life
of
its
own
so
rich
and
viscid
was
it
presently
it
was
midday
yet
was
there
but
little
change
in
the
nature
of
the
surrounding
wastes
though
it
may
be
that
the
vegetation
was
something
thicker
and
more
continuous
along
the
banks
but
the
banks
were
still
of
the
same
thick
clinging
mud
so
that
nowhere
could
we
effect
a
landing
though
had
we
the
rest
of
the
country
beyond
the
banks
seemed
no
better
and
all
the
while
as
we
pulled
we
glanced
continuously
from
bank
to
bank
and
those
who
worked
not
at
the
oars
were
fain
to
rest
a
hand
by
their
for
the
happenings
of
the
past
night
were
continually
in
our
minds
and
we
were
in
great
fear
so
that
we
had
turned
back
to
the
sea
but
that
we
had
come
so
nigh
to
the
end
of
our
provisions
ii
the
ship
in
the
creek
then
it
was
nigh
on
to
evening
we
came
upon
a
creek
opening
into
the
greater
one
through
the
bank
upon
our
left
we
had
been
like
to
pass
it
as
indeed
we
had
passed
many
throughout
the
day
but
that
the
whose
boat
had
the
lead
cried
out
that
there
was
some
craft
a
little
beyond
the
first
bend
and
indeed
so
it
seemed
for
one
of
the
masts
of
her
all
jagged
where
it
had
carried
away
stuck
up
plain
to
our
view
now
having
grown
sick
with
so
much
lonesomeness
and
being
in
fear
of
the
approaching
night
we
gave
out
something
near
to
a
cheer
which
however
the
silenced
having
no
knowledge
of
those
who
might
occupy
the
stranger
and
so
in
silence
the
turned
his
craft
toward
the
creek
whereat
we
followed
taking
heed
to
keep
quietness
and
working
the
oars
warily
so
in
a
little
we
came
to
the
shoulder
of
the
bend
and
had
plain
sight
of
the
vessel
some
little
way
beyond
us
from
the
distance
she
had
no
appearance
of
being
inhabited
so
that
after
some
small
hesitation
we
pulled
towards
her
though
still
being
at
pains
to
keep
silence
the
strange
vessel
lay
against
that
bank
of
the
creek
which
was
upon
our
right
and
over
above
her
was
a
thick
clump
of
the
stunted
trees
for
the
rest
she
appeared
to
be
firmly
imbedded
in
the
heavy
mud
and
there
was
a
certain
look
of
age
about
her
which
carried
to
me
a
doleful
suggestion
that
we
should
find
naught
aboard
of
her
fit
for
an
honest
stomach
we
had
come
to
a
distance
of
maybe
some
ten
fathoms
from
her
starboard
bow
for
she
lay
with
her
head
down
towards
the
mouth
of
the
little
creek
when
the
bade
his
men
to
back
water
the
which
josh
did
regarding
our
own
boat
then
being
ready
to
fly
if
we
had
been
in
danger
the
hailed
the
stranger
but
got
no
reply
save
that
some
echo
of
his
shout
seemed
to
come
back
at
us
and
so
he
sung
out
again
to
her
chance
there
might
be
some
below
decks
who
had
not
caught
his
first
hail
but
for
the
second
time
no
answer
came
to
us
save
the
low
echo
naught
but
that
the
silent
trees
took
on
a
little
quivering
as
though
his
voice
had
shaken
them
at
that
being
confident
now
within
our
minds
we
laid
alongside
and
in
a
minute
had
shinned
up
the
oars
and
so
gained
her
decks
here
save
that
the
glass
of
the
skylight
of
the
main
cabin
had
been
broken
and
some
portion
of
the
framework
shattered
there
was
no
extraordinary
litter
so
that
it
appeared
to
us
as
though
she
had
been
no
great
while
abandoned
so
soon
as
the
had
made
his
way
up
from
the
boat
he
turned
aft
toward
the
scuttle
the
rest
of
us
following
we
found
the
leaf
of
the
scuttle
pulled
forward
to
within
an
inch
of
closing
and
so
much
effort
did
it
require
of
us
to
push
it
back
that
we
had
immediate
evidence
of
a
considerable
time
since
any
had
gone
down
that
way
however
it
was
no
great
while
before
we
were
below
and
here
we
found
the
main
cabin
to
be
empty
save
for
the
bare
furnishings
from
it
there
opened
off
two
at
the
forrard
end
and
the
captain
cabin
in
the
after
part
and
in
all
of
these
we
found
matters
of
clothing
and
sundries
such
as
proved
that
the
vessel
had
been
deserted
apparently
in
haste
in
further
proof
of
this
we
found
in
a
drawer
in
the
room
a
considerable
quantity
of
loose
gold
the
which
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
would
have
been
left
by
the
of
the
owner
of
the
staterooms
the
one
upon
the
starboard
side
gave
evidence
that
it
had
been
occupied
by
a
woman
no
doubt
a
passenger
the
other
in
which
there
were
two
bunks
had
been
shared
so
far
as
we
could
have
any
certainty
by
a
couple
of
young
men
and
this
we
gathered
by
observation
of
various
garments
which
were
scattered
carelessly
about
yet
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
we
spent
any
great
time
in
the
cabins
for
we
were
pressed
for
food
and
made
haste
under
the
directing
of
the
to
discover
if
the
hulk
held
victuals
whereby
we
might
be
kept
alive
to
this
end
we
removed
the
hatch
which
led
down
to
the
lazarette
and
lighting
two
lamps
which
we
had
with
us
in
the
boats
went
down
to
make
a
search
and
so
in
a
little
while
we
came
upon
two
casks
which
the
broke
open
with
a
hatchet
these
casks
were
sound
and
tight
and
in
them
was
ship
biscuit
very
good
and
fit
for
food
at
this
as
may
be
imagined
we
felt
eased
in
our
minds
knowing
that
there
was
no
immediate
fear
of
starvation
following
this
we
found
a
barrel
of
molasses
a
cask
of
rum
some
cases
of
dried
fruit
these
were
mouldy
and
scarce
fit
to
be
eaten
a
cask
of
salt
beef
another
of
pork
a
small
barrel
of
vinegar
a
case
of
brandy
two
barrels
of
flour
one
of
which
proved
to
be
and
a
bunch
of
tallow
dips
in
a
little
while
we
had
all
these
things
up
in
the
big
cabin
so
that
we
might
come
at
them
the
better
to
make
choice
of
that
which
was
fit
for
our
stomachs
and
that
which
was
otherwise
meantime
whilst
the
overhauled
these
matters
josh
called
a
couple
of
the
men
and
went
on
deck
to
bring
up
the
gear
from
the
boats
for
it
had
been
decided
that
we
should
pass
the
night
aboard
the
hulk
when
this
was
accomplished
josh
took
a
walk
forward
to
the
but
found
nothing
beyond
two
seamen
chests
a
and
some
odd
gear
there
were
indeed
no
more
than
ten
bunks
in
the
place
for
she
was
but
a
small
brig
and
had
no
call
for
a
great
crowd
yet
josh
was
more
than
a
little
puzzled
to
know
what
had
come
to
the
odd
chests
for
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
there
had
been
no
more
than
two
and
a
among
ten
men
but
to
this
at
that
time
he
had
no
answer
and
so
being
sharp
for
supper
made
a
return
to
the
deck
and
thence
to
the
main
cabin
now
while
he
had
been
gone
the
had
set
the
men
to
clearing
out
the
main
cabin
after
which
he
had
served
out
two
biscuits
apiece
all
round
and
a
tot
of
rum
to
josh
when
he
appeared
he
gave
the
same
and
in
a
little
we
called
a
sort
of
council
being
sufficiently
stayed
by
the
food
to
talk
yet
before
we
came
to
speech
we
made
shift
to
light
our
pipes
for
the
had
discovered
a
case
of
tobacco
in
the
captain
cabin
and
after
this
we
came
to
the
consideration
of
our
position
we
had
provender
so
the
calculated
to
last
us
for
the
better
part
of
two
months
and
this
without
any
great
stint
but
we
had
yet
to
prove
if
the
brig
held
water
in
her
casks
for
that
in
the
creek
was
brackish
even
so
far
as
we
had
penetrated
from
the
sea
else
we
had
not
been
in
need
to
the
charge
of
this
the
set
josh
along
with
two
of
the
men
another
he
told
to
take
charge
of
the
galley
so
long
as
we
were
in
the
hulk
but
for
that
night
he
said
we
had
no
need
to
do
aught
for
we
had
sufficient
of
water
in
the
boats
breakers
to
last
us
till
the
morrow
and
so
in
a
little
the
dusk
began
to
fill
the
cabin
but
we
talked
on
being
greatly
content
with
our
present
ease
and
the
good
tobacco
which
we
enjoyed
in
a
little
while
one
of
the
men
cried
out
suddenly
to
us
to
be
silent
and
in
that
minute
all
heard
it
a
far
wailing
the
same
which
had
come
to
us
in
the
evening
of
the
first
day
at
that
we
looked
at
one
another
through
the
smoke
and
the
growing
dark
and
even
as
we
looked
it
became
plainer
heard
until
in
a
while
it
was
all
about
us
aye
it
seemed
to
come
floating
down
through
the
broken
framework
of
the
skylight
as
though
some
weariful
unseen
thing
stood
and
cried
upon
the
decks
above
our
heads
now
through
all
that
crying
none
moved
none
that
is
save
josh
and
the
and
they
went
up
into
the
scuttle
to
see
whether
anything
was
in
sight
but
they
found
nothing
and
so
came
down
to
us
for
there
was
no
wisdom
in
exposing
ourselves
unarmed
as
we
were
save
for
our
and
so
in
a
little
the
night
crept
down
upon
the
world
and
still
we
sat
within
the
dark
cabin
none
speaking
and
knowing
of
the
rest
only
by
the
glows
of
their
pipes
all
at
once
there
came
a
low
muttered
growl
stealing
across
the
land
and
immediately
the
crying
was
quenched
in
its
sullen
thunder
it
died
away
and
there
was
a
full
minute
of
silence
then
once
more
it
came
and
it
was
nearer
and
more
plain
to
the
ear
i
took
my
pipe
from
my
mouth
for
i
had
come
again
upon
the
great
fear
and
uneasiness
which
the
happenings
of
the
first
night
had
bred
in
me
and
the
taste
of
the
smoke
brought
me
no
more
pleasure
the
muttered
growl
swept
over
our
heads
and
died
away
into
the
distance
and
there
was
a
sudden
silence
then
in
that
quietness
came
the
voice
he
was
bidding
us
haste
every
one
into
the
captain
cabin
as
we
moved
to
obey
him
he
ran
to
draw
over
the
lid
of
the
scuttle
and
josh
went
with
him
and
together
they
had
it
across
though
with
difficulty
when
we
had
come
into
the
captain
cabin
we
closed
and
barred
the
door
piling
two
great
sea
chests
up
against
it
and
so
we
felt
near
safe
for
we
knew
that
no
thing
man
nor
beast
could
come
at
us
there
yet
as
may
be
supposed
we
felt
not
altogether
secure
for
there
was
that
in
the
growling
which
now
filled
the
darkness
that
seemed
demoniac
and
we
knew
not
what
horrid
powers
were
abroad
and
so
through
the
night
the
growling
continued
seeming
to
be
mighty
near
unto
us
aye
almost
over
our
heads
and
of
a
loudness
far
surpassing
all
that
had
come
to
us
on
the
previous
night
so
that
i
thanked
the
almighty
that
we
had
come
into
shelter
in
the
midst
of
so
much
fear
iii
the
thing
that
made
search
now
at
times
i
fell
upon
sleep
as
did
most
of
the
others
but
for
the
most
part
i
lay
half
sleeping
and
half
waking
being
unable
to
attain
to
true
sleep
by
reason
of
the
everlasting
growling
above
us
in
the
night
and
the
fear
which
it
bred
in
me
thus
it
chanced
that
just
after
midnight
i
caught
a
sound
in
the
main
cabin
beyond
the
door
and
immediately
i
was
fully
waked
i
sat
me
up
and
listened
and
so
became
aware
that
something
was
fumbling
about
the
deck
of
the
main
cabin
at
that
i
got
to
my
feet
and
made
my
way
to
where
the
lay
meaning
to
waken
him
if
he
slept
but
he
caught
me
by
the
ankle
as
i
stooped
to
shake
him
and
whispered
to
me
to
keep
silence
for
he
too
had
been
aware
of
that
strange
noise
of
something
fumbling
beyond
in
the
big
cabin
in
a
little
we
crept
both
of
us
so
close
to
the
door
as
the
chests
would
allow
and
there
we
crouched
listening
but
could
not
tell
what
manner
of
thing
it
might
be
which
produced
so
strange
a
noise
for
it
was
neither
shuffling
nor
treading
of
any
kind
nor
yet
was
it
the
whirr
of
a
bat
wings
the
which
had
first
occurred
to
me
knowing
how
vampires
are
said
to
inhabit
the
nights
in
dismal
places
nor
yet
was
it
the
slurr
of
a
snake
but
rather
it
seemed
to
us
to
be
as
though
a
great
wet
cloth
were
being
rubbed
everywhere
across
the
floor
and
bulkheads
we
were
the
better
able
to
be
certain
of
the
truth
of
this
likeness
when
suddenly
it
passed
across
the
further
side
of
the
door
behind
which
we
listened
at
which
you
may
be
sure
we
drew
backwards
both
of
us
in
fright
though
the
door
and
the
chests
stood
between
us
and
that
which
rubbed
against
it
presently
the
sound
ceased
and
listen
as
we
might
we
could
no
longer
distinguish
it
yet
until
the
morning
we
dozed
no
more
being
troubled
in
mind
as
to
what
manner
of
thing
it
was
which
had
made
search
in
the
big
cabin
then
in
time
the
day
came
and
the
growling
ceased
for
a
mournful
while
the
sad
crying
filled
our
ears
and
then
at
last
the
eternal
silence
that
fills
the
day
hours
of
that
dismal
land
fell
upon
us
so
being
at
last
in
quietness
we
slept
being
greatly
awearied
about
seven
in
the
morning
the
waked
me
and
i
found
that
they
had
opened
the
door
into
the
big
cabin
but
though
the
and
i
made
careful
search
we
could
nowhere
come
upon
anything
to
tell
us
aught
concerning
the
thing
which
had
put
us
so
in
fright
yet
i
know
not
if
i
am
right
in
saying
that
we
came
upon
nothing
for
in
several
places
the
bulkheads
had
a
look
but
whether
this
had
been
there
before
that
night
we
had
no
means
of
telling
of
that
which
we
had
heard
the
bade
me
make
no
mention
for
he
would
not
have
the
men
put
more
in
fear
than
need
be
this
i
conceived
to
be
wisdom
and
so
held
my
peace
yet
i
was
much
troubled
in
my
mind
to
know
what
manner
of
thing
it
was
which
we
had
need
to
fear
and
more
i
desired
greatly
to
know
whether
we
should
be
free
of
it
in
the
daylight
hours
for
there
was
always
with
me
as
i
went
hither
and
thither
the
thought
that
it
for
that
is
how
i
designated
it
in
my
mind
might
come
upon
us
to
our
destruction
now
after
breakfast
at
which
we
had
each
a
portion
of
salt
pork
besides
rum
and
biscuit
for
by
now
the
fire
in
the
caboose
had
been
set
going
we
at
various
matters
under
the
directing
of
the
josh
and
two
of
the
men
made
examination
of
the
water
casks
and
the
rest
of
us
lifted
the
main
to
make
inspection
of
her
cargo
but
lo
we
found
nothing
save
some
three
feet
of
water
in
her
hold
by
this
time
josh
had
drawn
some
water
off
from
the
casks
but
it
was
most
unsuitable
for
drinking
being
vile
of
smell
and
taste
yet
the
bade
him
draw
some
into
buckets
so
that
the
air
might
haply
purify
it
but
though
this
was
done
and
the
water
allowed
to
stand
through
the
morning
it
was
but
little
better
at
this
as
might
be
imagined
we
were
exercised
in
our
minds
as
to
the
manner
in
which
we
should
come
upon
suitable
water
for
by
now
we
were
beginning
to
be
in
need
of
it
yet
though
one
said
one
thing
and
another
said
another
no
one
had
wit
enough
to
call
to
mind
any
method
by
which
our
need
should
be
satisfied
then
when
we
had
made
an
end
of
dining
the
sent
josh
with
four
of
the
men
up
stream
perchance
after
a
mile
or
two
the
water
should
prove
of
sufficient
freshness
to
meet
our
purpose
yet
they
returned
a
little
before
sundown
having
no
water
for
everywhere
it
was
salt
now
the
foreseeing
that
it
might
be
impossible
to
come
upon
water
had
set
the
man
whom
he
had
ordained
to
be
our
cook
to
boiling
the
creek
water
in
three
great
kettles
this
he
had
ordered
to
be
done
soon
after
the
boat
left
and
over
the
spout
of
each
he
had
hung
a
great
pot
of
iron
filled
with
cold
water
from
the
hold
this
being
cooler
than
that
from
the
creek
so
that
the
steam
from
each
kettle
impinged
upon
the
cold
surface
of
the
iron
pots
and
being
by
this
means
condensed
was
caught
in
three
buckets
placed
beneath
them
upon
the
floor
of
the
caboose
in
this
way
enough
water
was
collected
to
supply
us
for
the
evening
and
the
following
morning
yet
it
was
but
a
slow
method
and
we
had
sore
need
of
a
speedier
were
we
to
leave
the
hulk
so
soon
as
i
for
one
desired
we
made
our
supper
before
sunset
so
as
to
be
free
of
the
crying
which
we
had
reason
to
expect
after
that
the
shut
the
scuttle
and
we
went
every
one
of
us
into
the
captain
cabin
after
which
we
barred
the
door
as
on
the
previous
night
and
well
was
it
for
us
that
we
acted
with
this
prudence
by
the
time
that
we
had
come
into
the
captain
cabin
and
secured
the
door
it
was
upon
sunsetting
and
as
the
dusk
came
on
so
did
the
melancholy
wailing
pass
over
the
land
yet
being
by
now
somewhat
inured
to
so
much
strangeness
we
lit
our
pipes
and
smoked
though
i
observed
that
none
talked
for
the
crying
without
was
not
to
be
forgotten
now
as
i
have
said
we
kept
silence
but
this
was
only
for
a
time
and
our
reason
for
breaking
it
was
a
discovery
made
by
george
the
younger
apprentice
this
lad
being
no
smoker
was
fain
to
do
something
to
while
away
the
time
and
with
this
intent
he
had
raked
out
the
contents
of
a
small
box
which
had
lain
upon
the
deck
at
the
side
of
the
forrard
bulkhead
the
box
had
appeared
filled
with
odd
small
lumber
of
which
a
part
was
a
dozen
or
so
grey
paper
wrappers
such
as
are
used
i
believe
for
carrying
samples
of
corn
though
i
have
seen
them
put
to
other
purposes
as
indeed
was
now
the
case
at
first
george
had
tossed
these
aside
but
it
growing
darker
the
lit
one
of
the
candles
which
we
had
found
in
the
lazarette
thus
george
who
was
proceeding
to
tidy
back
the
rubbish
which
was
cumbering
the
place
discovered
something
which
caused
him
to
cry
out
to
us
his
astonishment
now
upon
hearing
george
call
out
the
bade
him
keep
silence
thinking
it
was
but
a
piece
of
boyish
restlessness
but
george
drew
the
candle
to
him
and
bade
us
to
listen
for
the
wrappers
were
covered
with
fine
handwriting
after
the
fashion
of
a
woman
even
as
george
told
us
of
that
which
he
had
found
we
became
aware
that
the
night
was
upon
us
for
suddenly
the
crying
ceased
and
in
place
thereof
there
came
out
of
the
far
distance
the
low
thunder
of
the
that
had
tormented
us
through
the
past
two
nights
for
a
space
we
ceased
to
smoke
and
sat
listening
for
it
was
a
very
fearsome
sound
in
a
very
little
while
it
seemed
to
surround
the
ship
as
on
the
previous
nights
but
at
length
using
ourselves
to
it
we
resumed
our
smoking
and
bade
george
to
read
out
to
us
from
the
writing
upon
the
paper
wrappers
then
george
though
shaking
somewhat
in
his
voice
began
to
decipher
that
which
was
upon
the
wrappers
and
a
strange
and
awesome
story
it
was
and
bearing
much
upon
our
own
concerns
now
when
they
discovered
the
spring
among
the
trees
that
crown
the
bank
there
was
much
rejoicing
for
we
had
come
to
have
much
need
of
water
and
some
being
in
fear
of
the
ship
declaring
because
of
all
our
misfortune
and
the
strange
disappearances
of
their
messmates
and
the
brother
of
my
lover
that
she
was
haunted
by
a
devil
declared
their
intention
of
taking
their
gear
up
to
the
spring
and
there
making
a
camp
this
they
conceived
and
carried
out
in
the
space
of
one
afternoon
though
our
captain
a
good
and
true
man
begged
of
them
as
they
valued
life
to
stay
within
the
shelter
of
their
yet
as
i
have
remarked
they
would
none
of
them
hark
to
his
counseling
and
because
the
mate
and
the
were
gone
he
had
no
means
of
compelling
them
to
wisdom
at
this
point
george
ceased
to
read
and
began
to
rustle
among
the
wrappers
as
though
in
search
for
the
continuation
of
the
story
presently
he
cried
out
that
he
could
not
find
it
and
dismay
was
upon
his
face
but
the
told
him
to
read
on
from
such
sheets
as
were
left
for
as
he
observed
we
had
no
knowledge
if
more
existed
and
we
were
fain
to
know
further
of
that
spring
which
from
the
story
appeared
to
be
over
the
bank
near
to
the
vessel
george
being
thus
adjured
picked
up
the
topmost
sheet
for
they
were
as
i
heard
him
explain
to
the
all
oddly
numbered
and
having
but
little
reference
one
to
the
other
yet
we
were
mightily
keen
to
know
even
so
much
as
such
odd
scraps
might
tell
unto
us
whereupon
george
read
from
the
next
wrapper
which
ran
thus
now
suddenly
i
heard
the
captain
cry
out
that
there
was
something
in
the
main
cabin
and
immediately
my
lover
voice
calling
to
me
to
lock
my
door
and
on
no
condition
to
open
it
then
the
door
of
the
cabin
slammed
and
there
came
a
silence
and
the
silence
was
broken
by
a
now
this
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
heard
the
thing
make
search
through
the
big
cabin
but
afterwards
my
lover
told
me
it
had
happened
aforetime
and
they
had
told
me
naught
fearing
to
frighten
me
needlessly
though
now
i
understood
why
my
lover
had
bidden
me
never
to
leave
my
stateroom
door
unbolted
in
the
nighttime
i
remember
also
wondering
if
the
noise
of
breaking
glass
that
had
waked
me
somewhat
from
my
dreams
a
night
or
two
previously
had
been
the
work
of
this
indescribable
thing
for
on
the
morning
following
that
night
the
glass
in
the
skylight
had
been
smashed
thus
it
was
that
my
thoughts
wandered
out
to
trifles
while
yet
my
soul
seemed
ready
to
leap
out
from
my
bosom
with
fright
i
had
by
reason
of
usage
come
to
ability
to
sleep
despite
of
the
fearsome
growling
for
i
had
conceived
its
cause
to
be
the
mutter
of
spirits
in
the
night
and
had
not
allowed
myself
to
be
unnecessarily
frightened
with
doleful
thoughts
for
my
lover
had
assured
me
of
our
safety
and
that
we
should
yet
come
to
our
home
and
now
beyond
my
door
i
could
hear
that
fearsome
sound
of
the
thing
searching
george
came
to
a
sudden
pause
for
the
had
risen
and
put
a
great
hand
upon
his
shoulder
the
lad
made
to
speak
but
the
beckoned
to
him
to
say
no
word
and
at
that
we
who
had
grown
to
nervousness
through
the
happenings
in
the
story
began
every
one
to
listen
thus
we
heard
a
sound
which
had
escaped
us
in
the
noise
of
the
growling
without
the
vessel
and
the
interest
of
the
reading
for
a
space
we
kept
very
silent
no
man
doing
more
than
let
the
breath
go
in
and
out
of
his
body
and
so
each
one
of
us
knew
that
something
moved
without
in
the
big
cabin
in
a
little
something
touched
upon
our
door
and
it
was
as
i
have
mentioned
earlier
as
though
a
great
swab
rubbed
and
scrubbed
at
the
woodwork
at
this
the
men
nearest
unto
the
door
came
backwards
in
a
surge
being
put
in
sudden
fear
by
reason
of
the
thing
being
so
near
but
the
held
up
a
hand
bidding
them
in
a
low
voice
to
make
no
unneedful
noise
yet
as
though
the
sounds
of
their
moving
had
been
heard
the
door
was
shaken
with
such
violence
that
we
waited
everyone
expecting
to
see
it
torn
from
its
hinges
but
it
stood
and
we
hasted
to
brace
it
by
means
of
the
bunk
boards
which
we
placed
between
it
and
the
two
great
chests
and
upon
these
we
set
a
third
chest
so
that
the
door
was
quite
hid
now
i
have
no
remembrance
whether
i
have
put
down
that
when
we
came
first
to
the
ship
we
had
found
the
stern
window
upon
the
larboard
side
to
be
shattered
but
so
it
was
and
the
had
closed
it
by
means
of
a
cover
which
was
made
to
go
over
it
in
stormy
weather
with
stout
battens
across
which
were
set
tight
with
wedges
this
he
had
done
upon
the
first
night
having
fear
that
some
evil
thing
might
come
upon
us
through
the
opening
and
very
prudent
was
this
same
action
of
his
as
shall
be
seen
then
george
cried
out
that
something
was
at
the
cover
of
the
larboard
window
and
we
stood
back
growing
ever
more
fearful
because
that
some
evil
creature
was
so
eager
to
come
at
us
but
the
who
was
a
very
courageous
man
and
calm
withal
walked
over
to
the
closed
window
and
saw
to
it
that
the
battens
were
secure
for
he
had
knowledge
sufficient
to
be
sure
if
this
were
so
that
no
creature
with
strength
less
than
that
of
a
whale
could
break
it
down
and
in
such
case
its
bulk
would
assure
us
from
being
molested
then
even
as
he
made
sure
of
the
fastenings
there
came
a
cry
of
fear
from
some
of
the
men
for
there
had
come
at
the
glass
of
the
unbroken
window
a
reddish
mass
which
plunged
up
against
it
sucking
upon
it
as
it
were
then
josh
who
was
nearest
to
the
table
caught
up
the
candle
and
held
it
towards
the
thing
thus
i
saw
that
it
had
the
appearance
of
a
thing
shaped
as
it
might
be
out
of
raw
beef
it
was
at
this
we
stared
everyone
being
too
bemused
with
terror
to
do
aught
to
protect
ourselves
even
had
we
been
possessed
of
weapons
and
as
we
remained
thus
an
instant
like
silly
sheep
awaiting
the
butcher
i
heard
the
framework
creak
and
crack
and
there
ran
splits
all
across
the
glass
in
another
moment
the
whole
thing
would
have
been
torn
away
and
the
cabin
undefended
but
that
the
with
a
great
curse
at
us
for
our
landlubberly
lack
of
use
seized
the
other
cover
and
clapped
it
over
the
window
at
that
there
was
more
help
than
could
be
made
to
avail
and
the
battens
and
wedges
were
in
place
in
a
trice
that
this
was
no
sooner
accomplished
than
need
be
we
had
immediate
proof
for
there
came
a
rending
of
wood
and
a
splintering
of
glass
and
after
that
a
strange
yowling
out
in
the
dark
and
the
yowling
rose
above
and
drowned
the
continuous
growling
that
filled
the
night
in
a
little
it
died
away
and
in
the
brief
silence
that
seemed
to
ensue
we
heard
a
slobby
fumbling
at
the
teak
cover
but
it
was
well
secured
and
we
had
no
immediate
cause
for
fear
iv
the
two
faces
of
the
remainder
of
that
night
i
have
but
a
confused
memory
at
times
we
heard
the
door
shaken
behind
the
great
chests
but
no
harm
came
to
it
and
odd
whiles
there
was
a
soft
thudding
and
rubbing
upon
the
decks
over
our
heads
and
once
as
i
recollect
the
thing
made
a
final
try
at
the
teak
covers
across
the
windows
but
the
day
came
at
last
and
found
me
sleeping
indeed
we
had
slept
beyond
the
noon
but
that
the
mindful
of
our
needs
waked
us
and
we
removed
the
chests
yet
for
perhaps
the
space
of
a
minute
none
durst
open
the
door
until
the
bid
us
stand
to
one
side
we
faced
about
at
him
then
and
saw
that
he
held
a
great
cutlass
in
his
right
hand
he
called
to
us
that
there
were
four
more
of
the
weapons
and
made
a
backward
motion
with
his
left
hand
towards
an
open
locker
at
that
as
might
be
supposed
we
made
some
haste
to
the
place
to
which
he
pointed
and
found
that
among
some
other
gear
there
were
three
more
weapons
such
as
he
held
but
the
fourth
was
a
straight
and
this
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
secure
being
now
armed
we
ran
to
join
the
for
by
this
he
had
the
door
open
and
was
scanning
the
main
cabin
i
would
remark
here
how
a
good
weapon
doth
seem
to
put
heart
into
a
man
for
i
who
but
a
few
short
hours
since
had
feared
for
my
life
was
now
right
full
of
lustiness
and
fight
which
mayhap
was
no
matter
for
regret
from
the
main
cabin
the
led
up
on
to
the
deck
and
i
remember
some
surprise
at
finding
the
lid
of
the
scuttle
even
as
we
had
left
it
the
previous
night
but
then
i
recollected
that
the
skylight
was
broken
and
there
was
access
to
the
big
cabin
that
way
yet
i
questioned
within
myself
as
to
what
manner
of
thing
it
could
be
which
ignored
the
convenience
of
the
scuttle
and
descended
by
way
of
the
broken
skylight
we
made
a
search
of
the
decks
and
but
found
nothing
and
after
that
the
stationed
two
of
us
on
guard
whilst
the
rest
went
about
such
duties
as
were
needful
in
a
little
we
came
to
breakfast
and
after
that
we
prepared
to
test
the
story
upon
the
sample
wrappers
and
see
perchance
whether
there
was
indeed
a
spring
of
fresh
water
among
the
trees
now
between
the
vessel
and
the
trees
lay
a
slope
of
the
thick
mud
against
which
the
vessel
rested
to
have
scrambled
up
this
bank
had
been
next
to
impossible
by
reason
of
its
fat
richness
for
indeed
it
looked
fit
to
crawl
but
that
josh
called
out
to
the
that
he
had
come
upon
a
ladder
lashed
across
the
head
this
was
brought
also
several
hatch
covers
the
latter
were
placed
first
upon
the
mud
and
the
ladder
laid
upon
them
by
which
means
we
were
enabled
to
pass
up
to
the
top
of
the
bank
without
contact
with
the
mud
here
we
entered
at
once
among
the
trees
for
they
grew
right
up
to
the
edge
but
we
had
no
trouble
in
making
a
way
for
they
were
nowhere
close
together
but
standing
rather
each
one
in
a
little
open
space
by
itself
we
had
gone
a
little
way
among
the
trees
when
suddenly
one
who
was
with
us
cried
out
that
he
could
see
something
away
on
our
right
and
we
clutched
everyone
his
weapon
the
more
determinedly
and
went
towards
it
yet
it
proved
to
be
but
a
seaman
chest
and
a
space
further
off
we
discovered
another
and
so
after
a
little
walking
we
found
the
camp
but
there
was
small
semblance
of
a
camp
about
it
for
the
sail
of
which
the
tent
had
been
formed
was
all
torn
and
stained
and
lay
muddy
upon
the
ground
yet
the
spring
was
all
we
had
wished
clear
and
sweet
and
so
we
knew
we
might
dream
of
deliverance
now
upon
our
discovery
of
the
spring
it
might
be
thought
that
we
should
set
up
a
shout
to
those
upon
the
vessel
but
this
was
not
so
for
there
was
something
in
the
air
of
the
place
which
cast
a
gloom
upon
our
spirits
and
we
had
no
disinclination
to
return
unto
the
vessel
upon
coming
to
the
brig
the
called
to
four
of
the
men
to
go
down
into
the
boats
and
pass
up
the
breakers
also
he
collected
all
the
buckets
belonging
to
the
brig
and
forthwith
each
of
us
was
set
to
our
work
some
those
with
the
weapons
entered
into
the
wood
and
gave
down
the
water
to
those
stationed
upon
the
bank
and
these
in
turn
passed
it
to
those
in
the
vessel
to
the
man
in
the
galley
the
gave
command
to
fill
a
boiler
with
some
of
the
most
select
pieces
of
the
pork
and
beef
from
the
casks
and
get
them
cooked
so
soon
as
might
be
and
so
we
were
kept
at
it
for
it
had
been
determined
now
that
we
had
come
upon
water
that
we
should
stay
not
an
hour
longer
in
that
craft
and
we
were
all
agog
to
get
the
boats
revictualled
and
put
back
to
the
sea
from
which
we
had
too
gladly
escaped
so
we
worked
through
all
that
remainder
of
the
morning
and
right
on
into
the
afternoon
for
we
were
in
mortal
fear
of
the
coming
dark
towards
four
the
sent
the
man
who
had
been
set
to
do
our
cooking
up
to
us
with
slices
of
salt
meat
upon
biscuits
and
we
ate
as
we
worked
washing
our
throats
with
water
from
the
spring
and
so
before
the
evening
we
had
filled
our
breakers
and
near
every
vessel
which
was
convenient
for
us
to
take
in
the
boats
more
some
of
us
snatched
the
chance
to
wash
our
bodies
for
we
were
sore
with
brine
having
dipped
in
the
sea
to
keep
down
thirst
as
much
as
might
be
now
though
it
had
not
taken
us
so
great
a
while
to
make
a
finish
of
our
if
matters
had
been
more
convenient
yet
because
of
the
softness
of
the
ground
under
our
feet
and
the
care
with
which
we
had
to
pick
our
steps
and
some
little
distance
between
us
and
the
brig
it
had
grown
later
than
we
desired
before
we
had
made
an
end
therefore
when
the
sent
word
that
we
should
come
aboard
and
bring
our
gear
we
made
all
haste
thus
as
it
chanced
i
found
that
i
had
left
my
sword
beside
the
spring
having
placed
it
there
to
have
two
hands
for
the
carrying
of
one
of
the
breakers
at
my
remarking
my
loss
george
who
stood
near
cried
out
that
he
would
run
for
it
and
was
gone
in
a
moment
being
greatly
curious
to
see
the
spring
now
at
this
moment
the
came
up
and
called
for
george
but
i
informed
him
that
he
had
run
to
the
spring
to
bring
me
my
sword
at
this
the
stamped
his
foot
and
swore
a
great
oath
declaring
that
he
had
kept
the
lad
by
him
all
the
day
having
a
wish
to
keep
him
from
any
danger
which
the
wood
might
hold
and
knowing
the
lad
desire
to
adventure
there
at
this
a
matter
which
i
should
have
known
i
reproached
myself
for
so
gross
a
piece
of
stupidity
and
hastened
after
the
who
had
disappeared
over
the
top
of
the
bank
i
saw
his
back
as
he
passed
into
the
wood
and
ran
until
i
was
up
with
him
for
suddenly
as
it
were
i
found
that
a
sense
of
chilly
dampness
had
come
among
the
trees
though
a
while
before
the
place
had
been
full
of
the
warmth
of
the
sun
this
i
put
to
the
account
of
evening
which
was
drawing
on
apace
and
also
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
there
were
but
the
two
of
us
we
came
to
the
spring
but
george
was
not
to
be
seen
and
i
saw
no
sign
of
my
sword
at
this
the
raised
his
voice
and
cried
out
the
lad
name
once
he
called
and
again
then
at
the
second
shout
we
heard
the
boy
shrill
halloo
from
some
distance
ahead
among
the
trees
at
that
we
ran
towards
the
sound
plunging
heavily
across
the
ground
which
was
covered
with
a
thick
scum
that
clogged
the
feet
in
walking
as
we
ran
we
hallooed
and
so
came
upon
the
boy
and
i
saw
that
he
had
my
sword
the
ran
towards
him
and
caught
him
by
the
arm
speaking
with
anger
and
commanding
him
to
return
with
us
immediately
to
the
vessel
but
the
lad
for
reply
pointed
with
my
sword
and
we
saw
that
he
pointed
at
what
appeared
to
be
a
bird
against
the
trunk
of
one
of
the
trees
this
as
i
moved
closer
i
perceived
to
be
a
part
of
the
tree
and
no
bird
but
it
had
a
very
wondrous
likeness
to
a
bird
so
much
so
that
i
went
up
to
it
to
see
if
my
eyes
had
deceived
me
yet
it
seemed
no
more
than
a
freak
of
nature
though
most
wondrous
in
its
fidelity
being
but
an
excrescence
upon
the
trunk
with
a
sudden
thought
that
it
would
make
me
a
curio
i
reached
up
to
see
whether
i
could
break
it
away
from
the
tree
but
it
was
above
my
reach
so
that
i
had
to
leave
it
yet
one
thing
i
discovered
for
in
stretching
towards
the
protuberance
i
had
placed
a
hand
upon
the
tree
and
its
trunk
was
soft
as
pulp
under
my
fingers
much
after
the
fashion
of
a
mushroom
as
we
turned
to
go
the
inquired
of
george
his
reason
for
going
beyond
the
spring
and
george
told
him
that
he
had
seemed
to
hear
someone
calling
to
him
among
the
trees
and
there
had
been
so
much
pain
in
the
voice
that
he
had
run
towards
it
but
been
unable
to
discover
the
owner
immediately
afterwards
he
had
seen
the
curious
excrescence
upon
a
tree
nearby
then
we
had
called
and
of
the
rest
we
had
knowledge
we
had
come
nigh
to
the
spring
on
our
return
journey
when
a
sudden
low
whine
seemed
to
run
among
the
trees
i
glanced
towards
the
sky
and
realized
that
the
evening
was
upon
us
i
was
about
to
remark
upon
this
to
the
when
abruptly
he
came
to
a
stand
and
bent
forward
to
stare
into
the
shadows
to
our
right
at
that
george
and
i
turned
ourselves
about
to
perceive
what
matter
it
was
which
had
attracted
the
attention
of
the
thus
we
made
out
a
tree
some
twenty
yards
away
which
had
all
its
branches
wrapped
about
its
trunk
much
as
the
lash
of
a
whip
is
wound
about
its
stock
now
this
seemed
to
us
a
very
strange
sight
and
we
made
all
of
us
toward
it
to
learn
the
reason
of
so
extraordinary
a
happening
yet
when
we
had
come
close
upon
it
we
had
no
means
of
arriving
at
a
knowledge
of
that
which
it
portended
but
walked
each
of
us
around
the
tree
and
were
more
astonished
after
our
circumnavigation
of
the
great
vegetable
than
before
now
suddenly
and
in
the
distance
i
caught
the
far
wailing
that
came
before
the
night
and
abruptly
as
it
seemed
to
me
the
tree
wailed
at
us
at
that
i
was
vastly
astonished
and
frightened
yet
though
i
retreated
i
could
not
withdraw
my
gaze
from
the
tree
but
scanned
it
the
more
intently
and
suddenly
i
saw
a
brown
human
face
peering
at
us
from
between
the
wrapped
branches
at
this
i
stood
very
still
being
seized
with
that
fear
which
renders
one
shortly
incapable
of
movement
then
before
i
had
possession
of
myself
i
saw
that
it
was
of
a
part
with
the
trunk
of
the
tree
for
i
could
not
tell
where
it
ended
and
the
tree
began
then
i
caught
the
by
the
arm
and
pointed
for
whether
it
was
a
part
of
the
tree
or
not
it
was
a
work
of
the
devil
but
the
on
seeing
it
ran
straightway
so
close
to
the
tree
that
he
might
have
touched
it
with
his
hand
and
i
found
myself
beside
him
now
george
who
was
on
the
other
side
whispered
that
there
was
another
face
not
unlike
to
a
woman
and
indeed
so
soon
as
i
perceived
it
i
saw
that
the
tree
had
a
second
excrescence
most
strangely
after
the
face
of
a
woman
then
the
cried
out
with
an
oath
at
the
strangeness
of
the
thing
and
i
felt
the
arm
which
i
held
shake
somewhat
as
it
might
be
with
a
deep
emotion
then
far
away
i
heard
again
the
sound
of
the
wailing
and
immediately
from
among
the
trees
about
us
there
came
answering
wails
and
a
great
sighing
and
before
i
had
time
to
be
more
than
aware
of
these
things
the
tree
wailed
again
at
us
and
at
that
the
cried
out
suddenly
that
he
knew
though
of
what
it
was
that
he
i
had
at
that
time
no
knowledge
and
immediately
he
began
with
his
cutlass
to
strike
at
the
tree
before
us
and
to
cry
upon
god
to
blast
it
and
lo
at
his
smiting
a
very
fearsome
thing
happened
for
the
tree
did
bleed
like
any
live
creature
thereafter
a
great
yowling
came
from
it
and
it
began
to
writhe
and
suddenly
i
became
aware
that
all
about
us
the
trees
were
then
george
cried
out
and
ran
round
upon
my
side
of
the
and
i
saw
that
one
of
the
great
things
pursued
him
upon
its
stem
even
as
an
evil
serpent
and
very
dreadful
it
was
for
it
had
become
blood
red
in
color
but
i
smote
it
with
the
sword
which
i
had
taken
from
the
lad
and
it
fell
to
the
ground
now
from
the
brig
i
heard
them
hallooing
and
the
trees
had
become
like
live
things
and
there
was
a
vast
growling
in
the
air
and
hideous
trumpetings
then
i
caught
the
again
by
the
arm
and
shouted
to
him
that
we
must
run
for
our
lives
and
this
we
did
smiting
with
our
swords
as
we
ran
for
there
came
things
at
us
out
from
the
growing
dusk
thus
we
made
the
brig
and
the
boats
being
ready
i
scrambled
after
the
into
his
and
we
put
straightway
into
the
creek
all
of
us
pulling
with
so
much
haste
as
our
loads
would
allow
as
we
went
i
looked
back
at
the
brig
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
multitude
of
things
hung
over
the
bank
above
her
and
there
seemed
a
flicker
of
things
moving
hither
and
thither
aboard
of
her
and
then
we
were
in
the
great
creek
up
which
we
had
come
and
so
in
a
little
it
was
night
all
that
night
we
rowed
keeping
very
strictly
to
the
center
of
the
big
creek
and
all
about
us
bellowed
the
vast
growling
being
more
fearsome
than
ever
i
had
heard
it
until
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
had
waked
all
that
land
of
terror
to
a
knowledge
of
our
presence
but
when
the
morning
came
so
good
a
speed
had
we
made
what
with
our
fear
and
the
current
being
with
us
that
we
were
nigh
upon
the
open
sea
whereat
each
one
of
us
raised
a
shout
feeling
like
freed
prisoners
and
so
full
of
thankfulness
to
the
almighty
we
rowed
outward
to
the
sea
v
the
great
storm
now
as
i
have
said
we
came
at
last
in
safety
to
the
open
sea
and
so
for
a
time
had
some
degree
of
peace
though
it
was
long
ere
we
threw
off
all
of
the
terror
which
the
land
of
lonesomeness
had
cast
over
our
hearts
and
one
more
matter
there
is
regarding
that
land
which
my
memory
recalls
it
will
be
remembered
that
george
found
certain
wrappers
upon
which
there
was
writing
now
in
the
haste
of
our
leaving
he
had
given
no
thought
to
take
them
with
him
yet
a
portion
of
one
he
found
within
the
side
pocket
of
his
jacket
and
it
ran
somewhat
thus
but
i
hear
my
lover
voice
wailing
in
the
night
and
i
go
to
find
him
for
my
loneliness
is
not
to
be
borne
may
god
have
mercy
upon
me
and
that
was
all
for
a
day
and
a
night
we
stood
out
from
the
land
towards
the
north
having
a
steady
breeze
to
which
we
set
our
lug
sails
and
so
made
very
good
way
the
sea
being
quiet
though
with
a
slow
lumbering
swell
from
the
southward
it
was
on
the
morning
of
the
second
day
of
our
escape
that
we
met
with
the
beginnings
of
our
adventure
into
the
silent
sea
the
which
i
am
about
to
make
as
clear
as
i
am
able
the
night
had
been
quiet
and
the
breeze
steady
until
near
on
to
the
dawn
when
the
wind
slacked
away
to
nothing
and
we
lay
there
waiting
perchance
the
sun
should
bring
the
breeze
with
it
and
this
it
did
but
no
such
wind
as
we
did
desire
for
when
the
morning
came
upon
us
we
discovered
all
that
part
of
the
sky
to
be
full
of
a
fiery
redness
which
presently
spread
away
down
to
the
south
so
that
an
entire
quarter
of
the
heavens
was
as
it
seemed
to
us
a
mighty
arc
of
fire
now
at
the
sight
of
these
omens
the
gave
orders
to
prepare
the
boats
for
the
storm
which
we
had
reason
to
expect
looking
for
it
in
the
south
for
it
was
from
that
direction
that
the
swell
came
rolling
upon
us
with
this
intent
we
roused
out
so
much
heavy
canvas
as
the
boats
contained
for
we
had
gotten
a
bolt
and
a
half
from
the
hulk
in
the
creek
also
the
boat
covers
which
we
could
lash
down
to
the
brass
studs
under
the
gunnels
of
the
boats
then
in
each
boat
we
mounted
the
whaleback
which
had
been
stowed
along
the
tops
of
the
thwarts
also
its
supports
lashing
the
same
to
the
thwarts
below
the
knees
then
we
laid
two
lengths
of
the
stout
canvas
the
full
length
of
the
boat
over
the
whaleback
overlapping
and
nailing
them
to
the
same
so
that
they
sloped
away
down
over
the
gunnels
upon
each
side
as
though
they
had
formed
a
roof
to
us
here
whilst
some
stretched
the
canvas
nailing
its
lower
edges
to
the
gunnels
others
were
employed
in
lashing
together
the
oars
and
the
mast
and
to
this
bundle
they
secured
a
considerable
length
of
new
hemp
rope
which
we
had
brought
away
from
the
hulk
along
with
the
canvas
this
rope
was
then
passed
over
the
bows
and
in
through
the
painter
ring
and
thence
to
the
forrard
thwarts
where
it
was
made
fast
and
we
gave
attention
to
parcel
it
with
odd
strips
of
canvas
against
danger
of
chafe
and
the
same
was
done
in
both
of
the
boats
for
we
could
not
put
our
trust
in
the
painters
besides
which
they
had
not
sufficient
length
to
secure
safe
and
easy
riding
now
by
this
time
we
had
the
canvas
nailed
down
to
the
gunnels
around
our
boat
after
which
we
spread
the
over
it
lacing
it
down
to
the
brass
studs
beneath
the
gunnel
and
so
we
had
all
the
boat
covered
in
save
a
place
in
the
stern
where
a
man
might
stand
to
wield
the
steering
oar
for
the
boats
were
double
bowed
and
in
each
boat
we
made
the
same
preparation
lashing
all
movable
articles
and
preparing
to
meet
so
great
a
storm
as
might
well
fill
the
heart
with
terror
for
the
sky
cried
out
to
us
that
it
would
be
no
light
wind
and
further
the
great
swell
from
the
south
grew
more
huge
with
every
hour
that
passed
though
as
yet
it
was
without
virulence
being
slow
and
oily
and
black
against
the
redness
of
the
sky
presently
we
were
ready
and
had
cast
over
the
bundle
of
oars
and
the
mast
which
was
to
serve
as
our
sea
anchor
and
so
we
lay
waiting
it
was
at
this
time
that
the
called
over
to
josh
certain
advice
with
regard
to
that
which
lay
before
us
and
after
that
the
two
of
them
sculled
the
boats
a
little
apart
for
there
might
be
a
danger
of
their
being
dashed
together
by
the
first
violence
of
the
storm
and
so
came
a
time
of
waiting
with
josh
and
the
each
of
them
at
the
steering
oars
and
the
rest
of
us
stowed
away
under
the
coverings
from
where
i
crouched
near
the
i
had
sight
of
josh
away
upon
our
port
side
he
was
standing
up
black
as
a
shape
of
night
against
the
mighty
redness
when
the
boat
came
to
the
foamless
crowns
of
the
swells
and
then
gone
from
sight
in
the
hollows
between
now
midday
had
come
and
gone
and
we
had
made
shift
to
eat
so
good
a
meal
as
our
appetites
would
allow
for
we
had
no
knowledge
how
long
it
might
be
ere
we
should
have
chance
of
another
if
indeed
we
had
ever
need
to
think
more
of
such
and
then
in
the
middle
part
of
the
afternoon
we
heard
the
first
cryings
of
the
storm
a
moaning
rising
and
falling
most
solemnly
presently
all
the
southern
part
of
the
horizon
so
high
up
maybe
as
some
seven
to
ten
degrees
was
blotted
out
by
a
great
black
wall
of
cloud
over
which
the
red
glare
came
down
upon
the
great
swells
as
though
from
the
light
of
some
vast
and
unseen
fire
it
was
about
this
time
i
observed
that
the
sun
had
the
appearance
of
a
great
full
moon
being
pale
and
clearly
defined
and
seeming
to
have
no
warmth
nor
brilliancy
and
this
as
may
be
imagined
seemed
most
strange
to
us
the
more
so
because
of
the
redness
in
the
south
and
east
and
all
this
while
the
swells
increased
most
prodigiously
though
without
making
broken
water
yet
they
informed
us
that
we
had
done
well
to
take
so
much
precaution
for
surely
they
were
raised
by
a
very
great
storm
a
little
before
evening
the
moaning
came
again
and
then
a
space
of
silence
after
which
there
rose
a
very
sudden
bellowing
as
of
wild
beasts
and
then
once
more
the
silence
about
this
time
the
making
no
objection
i
raised
my
head
above
the
cover
until
i
was
in
a
standing
position
for
until
now
i
had
taken
no
more
than
occasional
peeps
and
i
was
very
glad
of
the
chance
to
stretch
my
limbs
for
i
had
grown
mightily
cramped
having
stirred
the
sluggishness
of
my
blood
i
sat
me
down
again
but
in
such
position
that
i
could
see
every
part
of
the
horizon
without
difficulty
ahead
of
us
that
is
to
the
south
i
saw
now
that
the
great
wall
of
cloud
had
risen
some
further
degrees
and
there
was
something
less
of
the
redness
though
indeed
what
there
was
left
of
it
was
sufficiently
terrifying
for
it
appeared
to
crest
the
black
cloud
like
red
foam
seeming
it
might
be
as
though
a
mighty
sea
made
ready
to
break
over
the
world
towards
the
west
the
sun
was
sinking
behind
a
curious
haze
which
gave
it
the
appearance
of
a
dull
red
disk
to
the
north
seeming
very
high
in
the
sky
were
some
flecks
of
cloud
lying
motionless
and
of
a
very
pretty
rose
color
and
here
i
may
remark
that
all
the
sea
to
the
north
of
us
appeared
as
a
very
ocean
of
dull
red
fire
though
as
might
be
expected
the
swells
coming
up
from
the
south
against
the
light
were
so
many
exceeding
great
hills
of
blackness
it
was
just
after
i
had
made
these
observations
that
we
heard
again
the
distant
roaring
of
the
storm
and
i
know
not
how
to
convey
the
exceeding
terror
of
that
sound
it
was
as
though
some
mighty
beast
growled
far
down
towards
the
south
and
it
seemed
to
make
very
clear
to
me
that
we
were
but
two
small
craft
in
a
very
lonesome
place
then
even
while
the
roaring
lasted
i
saw
a
sudden
light
flare
up
as
it
were
from
the
edge
of
the
southern
horizon
it
had
somewhat
the
appearance
of
lightning
yet
vanished
not
immediately
as
is
the
wont
of
lightning
and
more
it
had
not
been
my
experience
to
witness
such
spring
up
from
out
of
the
sea
but
rather
down
from
the
heavens
yet
i
have
little
doubt
but
that
it
was
a
form
of
lightning
for
it
came
many
times
after
this
so
that
i
had
chance
to
observe
it
minutely
and
frequently
as
i
watched
the
storm
would
shout
at
us
in
a
most
fearsome
manner
then
when
the
sun
was
low
upon
the
horizon
there
came
to
our
ears
a
very
shrill
screaming
noise
most
penetrating
and
distressing
and
immediately
afterwards
the
shouted
out
something
in
a
hoarse
voice
and
commenced
to
sway
furiously
upon
the
steering
oar
i
saw
his
stare
fixed
upon
a
point
a
little
on
our
larboard
bow
and
perceived
that
in
that
direction
the
sea
was
all
blown
up
into
vast
clouds
of
froth
and
i
knew
that
the
storm
was
upon
us
immediately
afterwards
a
cold
blast
struck
us
but
we
suffered
no
harm
for
the
had
gotten
the
boat
by
this
the
wind
passed
us
and
there
was
an
instant
of
calm
and
now
all
the
air
above
us
was
full
of
a
continuous
roaring
so
very
loud
and
intense
that
i
was
like
to
be
deafened
to
windward
i
perceived
an
enormous
wall
of
spray
bearing
down
upon
us
and
i
heard
again
the
shrill
screaming
pierce
through
the
roaring
then
the
whipped
in
his
oar
under
the
cover
and
reaching
forward
drew
the
canvas
aft
so
that
it
covered
the
entire
boat
and
he
held
it
down
against
the
gunnel
upon
the
starboard
side
shouting
in
my
ear
to
do
likewise
upon
the
larboard
now
had
it
not
been
for
this
forethought
on
the
part
of
the
we
had
been
all
dead
men
and
this
may
be
the
better
believed
when
i
explain
that
we
felt
the
water
falling
upon
the
stout
canvas
overhead
tons
and
tons
though
so
beaten
to
froth
as
to
lack
solidity
to
sink
or
crush
us
i
have
said
felt
for
i
would
make
it
so
clear
as
may
be
here
once
and
for
all
that
so
intense
was
the
roaring
and
screaming
of
the
elements
there
could
no
sound
have
penetrated
to
us
no
not
the
pealing
of
mighty
thunders
and
so
for
the
space
of
maybe
a
full
minute
the
boat
quivered
and
shook
most
vilely
so
that
she
seemed
like
to
have
been
shaken
in
pieces
and
from
a
dozen
places
between
the
gunnel
and
the
covering
canvas
the
water
spurted
in
upon
us
and
here
one
other
thing
i
would
make
mention
of
during
that
minute
the
boat
had
ceased
to
rise
and
fall
upon
the
great
swell
and
whether
this
was
because
the
sea
was
flattened
by
the
first
rush
of
the
wind
or
that
the
excess
of
the
storm
held
her
steady
i
am
unable
to
tell
and
can
put
down
only
that
which
we
felt
now
in
a
little
the
first
fury
of
the
blast
being
spent
the
boat
began
to
sway
from
side
to
side
as
though
the
wind
blew
now
upon
the
one
beam
and
now
upon
the
other
and
several
times
we
were
stricken
heavily
with
the
blows
of
solid
water
but
presently
this
ceased
and
we
returned
once
again
to
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
swell
only
that
now
we
received
a
cruel
jerk
every
time
that
the
boat
came
upon
the
top
of
a
sea
and
so
a
while
passed
towards
midnight
as
i
should
judge
there
came
some
mighty
flames
of
lightning
so
bright
that
they
lit
up
the
boat
through
the
double
covering
of
canvas
yet
no
man
of
us
heard
aught
of
the
thunder
for
the
roaring
of
the
storm
made
all
else
a
silence
and
so
to
the
dawn
after
which
finding
that
we
were
still
by
the
mercy
of
god
possessed
of
our
lives
we
made
shift
to
eat
and
drink
after
which
we
slept
now
being
extremely
wearied
by
the
stress
of
the
past
night
i
slumbered
through
many
hours
of
the
storm
waking
at
some
time
between
noon
and
evening
overhead
as
i
lay
looking
upwards
the
canvas
showed
of
a
dull
leadenish
color
blackened
completely
at
whiles
by
the
dash
of
spray
and
water
and
so
presently
having
eaten
again
and
feeling
that
all
things
lay
in
the
hands
of
the
almighty
i
came
once
more
upon
sleep
twice
through
the
following
night
was
i
wakened
by
the
boat
being
hurled
upon
her
by
the
blows
of
the
seas
but
she
righted
easily
and
took
scarce
any
water
the
canvas
proving
a
very
roof
of
safety
and
so
the
morning
came
again
being
now
rested
i
crawled
after
to
where
the
lay
and
the
noise
of
the
storm
lulling
odd
instants
shouted
in
his
ear
to
know
whether
the
wind
was
easing
at
whiles
to
this
he
nodded
whereat
i
felt
a
most
joyful
sense
of
hope
pulse
through
me
and
ate
such
food
as
could
be
gotten
with
a
very
good
relish
in
the
afternoon
the
sun
broke
out
suddenly
lighting
up
the
boat
most
gloomily
through
the
wet
canvas
yet
a
very
welcome
light
it
was
and
bred
in
us
a
hope
that
the
storm
was
near
to
breaking
in
a
little
the
sun
disappeared
but
presently
it
coming
again
the
beckoned
to
me
to
assist
him
and
we
removed
such
temporary
nails
as
we
had
used
to
fasten
down
the
after
part
of
the
canvas
and
pushed
back
the
covering
a
space
sufficient
to
allow
our
heads
to
go
through
into
the
daylight
on
looking
out
i
discovered
the
air
to
be
full
of
spray
beaten
as
fine
as
dust
and
then
before
i
could
note
aught
else
a
little
gout
of
water
took
me
in
the
face
with
such
force
as
to
deprive
me
of
breath
so
that
i
had
to
descend
beneath
the
canvas
for
a
little
while
so
soon
as
i
was
recovered
i
thrust
forth
my
head
again
and
now
i
had
some
sight
of
the
terrors
around
us
as
each
huge
sea
came
towards
us
the
boat
shot
up
to
meet
it
right
up
to
its
very
crest
and
there
for
the
space
of
some
instants
we
would
seem
to
be
swamped
in
a
very
ocean
of
foam
boiling
up
on
each
side
of
the
boat
to
the
height
of
many
feet
then
the
sea
passing
from
under
us
we
would
go
swooping
dizzily
down
the
great
black
back
of
the
wave
until
the
oncoming
sea
caught
us
up
most
mightily
odd
whiles
the
crest
of
a
sea
would
hurl
forward
before
we
had
reached
the
top
and
though
the
boat
shot
upward
like
a
veritable
feather
yet
the
water
would
swirl
right
over
us
and
we
would
have
to
draw
in
our
heads
most
suddenly
in
such
cases
the
wind
flapping
the
cover
down
so
soon
as
our
hands
were
removed
and
apart
from
the
way
in
which
the
boat
met
the
seas
there
was
a
very
sense
of
terror
in
the
air
the
continuous
roaring
and
howling
of
the
storm
the
of
the
foam
as
the
frothy
summits
of
the
briny
mountains
hurled
past
us
and
the
wind
that
tore
the
breath
out
of
our
weak
human
throats
are
things
scarce
to
be
conceived
presently
we
drew
in
our
heads
the
sun
having
vanished
again
and
nailed
down
the
canvas
once
more
and
so
prepared
for
the
night
from
here
on
until
the
morning
i
have
very
little
knowledge
of
any
happenings
for
i
slept
much
of
the
time
and
for
the
rest
there
was
little
to
know
cooped
up
beneath
the
cover
nothing
save
the
interminable
thundering
swoop
of
the
boat
downwards
and
then
the
halt
and
upward
hurl
and
the
occasional
plunges
and
surges
to
larboard
or
starboard
occasioned
i
can
only
suppose
by
the
indiscriminate
might
of
the
seas
i
would
make
mention
here
how
that
i
had
little
thought
all
this
while
for
the
peril
of
the
other
boat
and
indeed
i
was
so
very
full
of
our
own
that
it
is
no
matter
at
which
to
wonder
however
as
it
proved
and
as
this
is
a
most
suitable
place
in
which
to
tell
it
the
boat
that
held
josh
and
the
rest
of
the
crew
came
through
the
storm
with
safety
though
it
was
not
until
many
years
afterwards
that
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
hear
from
josh
himself
how
that
after
the
storm
they
were
picked
up
by
a
vessel
and
landed
in
the
port
of
london
and
now
to
our
own
happenings
vi
the
sea
it
was
some
little
while
before
midday
that
we
grew
conscious
that
the
sea
had
become
very
much
less
violent
and
this
despite
the
wind
roaring
with
scarce
abated
noise
and
presently
everything
about
the
boat
saving
the
wind
having
grown
indubitably
calmer
and
no
great
water
breaking
over
the
canvas
the
beckoned
me
again
to
assist
him
lift
the
after
part
of
the
cover
this
we
did
and
put
forth
our
heads
to
inquire
the
reason
of
the
unexpected
quietness
of
the
sea
not
knowing
but
that
we
had
come
suddenly
under
the
lee
of
some
unknown
land
yet
for
a
space
we
could
see
nothing
beyond
the
surrounding
billows
for
the
sea
was
still
very
furious
though
no
matter
to
cause
us
concern
after
that
through
which
we
had
come
presently
however
the
raising
himself
saw
something
and
bending
cried
in
my
ear
that
there
was
a
low
bank
which
broke
the
force
of
the
sea
but
he
was
full
of
wonder
to
know
how
that
we
had
passed
it
without
shipwreck
and
whilst
he
was
still
pondering
the
matter
i
raised
myself
and
took
a
look
on
all
sides
of
us
and
so
i
discovered
that
there
lay
another
great
bank
upon
our
larboard
side
and
this
i
pointed
out
to
him
immediately
afterwards
we
came
upon
a
great
mass
of
seaweed
swung
up
on
the
crest
of
a
sea
and
presently
another
and
so
we
drifted
on
and
the
seas
grew
less
with
astonishing
rapidity
so
that
in
a
little
we
stripped
off
the
cover
so
far
as
the
midship
thwart
for
the
rest
of
the
men
were
sorely
in
need
of
the
fresh
air
after
so
long
a
time
below
the
canvas
covering
it
was
after
we
had
eaten
that
one
of
them
made
out
that
there
was
another
low
bank
astern
upon
which
we
were
drifting
at
that
the
stood
up
and
made
an
examination
of
it
being
much
exercised
in
his
mind
to
know
how
we
might
come
clear
of
it
with
safety
presently
however
we
had
come
so
near
to
it
that
we
discovered
it
to
be
composed
of
seaweed
and
so
we
let
the
boat
drive
upon
it
making
no
doubt
but
that
the
other
banks
which
we
had
seen
were
of
a
similar
nature
in
a
little
we
had
driven
in
among
the
weed
yet
though
our
speed
was
greatly
slowed
we
made
some
progress
and
so
in
time
came
out
upon
the
other
side
and
now
we
found
the
sea
to
be
near
quiet
so
that
we
hauled
in
our
sea
anchor
which
had
collected
a
great
mass
of
weed
about
it
and
removed
the
whaleback
and
canvas
coverings
after
which
we
stepped
the
mast
and
set
a
tiny
upon
the
boat
for
we
wished
to
have
her
under
control
and
could
set
no
more
than
this
because
of
the
violence
of
the
breeze
thus
we
drove
on
before
the
wind
the
steering
and
avoiding
all
such
banks
as
showed
ahead
and
ever
the
sea
grew
calmer
then
when
it
was
near
on
to
evening
we
discovered
a
huge
stretch
of
the
weed
that
seemed
to
block
all
the
sea
ahead
and
at
that
we
hauled
down
the
foresail
and
took
to
our
oars
and
began
to
pull
broadside
on
to
it
towards
the
west
yet
so
strong
was
the
breeze
that
we
were
being
driven
down
rapidly
upon
it
and
then
just
before
sunset
we
opened
out
the
end
of
it
and
drew
in
our
oars
very
thankful
to
set
the
little
foresail
and
run
off
again
before
the
wind
and
so
presently
the
night
came
down
upon
us
and
the
made
us
take
turn
and
turn
about
to
keep
a
for
the
boat
was
going
some
knots
through
the
water
and
we
were
among
strange
seas
but
took
no
sleep
all
that
night
keeping
always
to
the
steering
oar
i
have
memory
during
my
time
of
watching
of
passing
odd
floating
masses
which
i
make
no
doubt
were
weed
and
once
we
drove
right
atop
of
one
but
drew
clear
without
much
trouble
and
all
the
while
through
the
dark
to
starboard
i
could
make
out
the
dim
outline
of
that
enormous
weed
extent
lying
low
upon
the
sea
and
seeming
without
end
and
so
presently
my
time
to
watch
being
at
an
end
i
returned
to
my
slumber
and
when
next
i
waked
it
was
morning
now
the
morning
discovered
to
me
that
there
was
no
end
to
the
weed
upon
our
starboard
side
for
it
stretched
away
into
the
distance
ahead
of
us
so
far
as
we
could
see
while
all
about
us
the
sea
was
full
of
floating
masses
of
the
stuff
and
then
suddenly
one
of
the
men
cried
out
that
there
was
a
vessel
in
among
the
weed
at
that
as
may
be
imagined
we
were
very
greatly
excited
and
stood
upon
the
thwarts
that
we
might
get
better
view
of
her
thus
i
saw
her
a
great
way
in
from
the
edge
of
the
weed
and
i
noted
that
her
foremast
was
gone
near
to
the
deck
and
she
had
no
main
topmast
though
strangely
enough
her
mizzen
stood
unharmed
and
beyond
this
i
could
make
out
but
little
because
of
the
distance
though
the
sun
which
was
upon
our
larboard
side
gave
me
some
sight
of
her
hull
but
not
much
because
of
the
weed
in
which
she
was
deeply
embedded
yet
it
seemed
to
me
that
her
sides
were
very
and
in
one
place
some
glistening
brown
object
which
may
have
been
a
fungus
caught
the
rays
of
the
sun
sending
off
a
wet
sheen
there
we
stood
all
of
us
upon
the
thwarts
staring
and
exchanging
opinions
and
were
like
to
have
overset
the
boat
but
that
the
ordered
us
down
and
after
this
we
made
our
breakfast
and
had
much
discussion
regarding
the
stranger
as
we
ate
later
towards
midday
we
were
able
to
set
our
mizzen
for
the
storm
had
greatly
modified
and
so
presently
we
hauled
away
to
the
west
to
escape
a
great
bank
of
the
weed
which
ran
out
from
the
main
body
upon
rounding
this
we
let
the
boat
off
again
and
set
the
main
lug
and
thus
made
very
good
speed
before
the
wind
yet
though
we
ran
all
that
afternoon
parallel
with
the
weed
to
starboard
we
came
not
to
its
end
and
three
separate
times
we
saw
the
hulks
of
rotting
vessels
some
of
them
having
the
appearance
of
a
previous
age
so
ancient
did
they
seem
now
towards
evening
the
wind
dropped
to
a
very
little
breeze
so
that
we
made
but
slow
way
and
thus
we
had
better
chance
to
study
the
weed
and
now
we
saw
that
it
was
full
of
crabs
though
for
the
most
part
so
very
minute
as
to
escape
the
casual
glance
yet
they
were
not
all
small
for
in
a
while
i
discovered
a
swaying
among
the
weed
a
little
way
in
from
the
edge
and
immediately
i
saw
the
mandible
of
a
very
great
crab
stir
amid
the
weed
at
that
hoping
to
obtain
it
for
food
i
pointed
it
out
to
the
suggesting
that
we
should
try
and
capture
it
and
so
there
being
by
now
scarce
any
wind
he
bade
us
get
out
a
couple
of
the
oars
and
back
the
boat
up
to
the
weed
this
we
did
after
which
he
made
fast
a
piece
of
salt
meat
to
a
bit
of
spun
yarn
and
bent
this
on
to
the
boat
hook
then
he
made
a
running
bowline
and
slipped
the
loop
on
to
the
shaft
of
the
boat
hook
after
which
he
held
out
the
boat
hook
after
the
fashion
of
a
fishing
rod
over
the
place
where
i
had
seen
the
crab
almost
immediately
there
swept
up
an
enormous
claw
and
grasped
the
meat
and
at
that
the
cried
out
to
me
to
take
an
oar
and
slide
the
bowline
along
the
so
that
it
should
fall
over
the
claw
and
this
i
did
and
immediately
some
of
us
hauled
upon
the
line
taughtening
it
about
the
great
claw
then
the
sung
out
to
us
to
haul
the
crab
aboard
that
we
had
it
most
securely
yet
on
the
instant
we
had
reason
to
wish
that
we
had
been
less
successful
for
the
creature
feeling
the
tug
of
our
pull
upon
it
tossed
the
weed
in
all
directions
and
thus
we
had
full
sight
of
it
and
discovered
it
to
be
so
great
a
crab
as
is
scarce
conceivable
a
very
monster
and
further
it
was
apparent
to
us
that
the
brute
had
no
fear
of
us
nor
intention
to
escape
but
rather
made
to
come
at
us
whereat
the
perceiving
our
danger
cut
the
line
and
bade
us
put
weight
upon
the
oars
and
so
in
a
moment
we
were
in
safety
and
very
determined
to
have
no
more
meddlings
with
such
creatures
presently
the
night
came
upon
us
and
the
wind
remaining
low
there
was
everywhere
about
us
a
great
stillness
most
solemn
after
the
continuous
roaring
of
the
storm
which
had
beset
us
in
the
previous
days
yet
now
and
again
a
little
wind
would
rise
and
blow
across
the
sea
and
where
it
met
the
weed
there
would
come
a
low
damp
rustling
so
that
i
could
hear
the
passage
of
it
for
no
little
time
after
the
calm
had
come
once
more
all
about
us
now
it
is
a
strange
thing
that
i
who
had
slept
amid
the
noise
of
the
past
days
should
find
sleeplessness
amid
so
much
calm
yet
so
it
was
and
presently
i
took
the
steering
oar
proposing
that
the
rest
should
sleep
and
to
this
the
agreed
first
warning
me
however
most
particularly
to
have
care
that
i
kept
the
boat
off
the
weed
for
we
had
still
a
little
way
on
us
and
further
to
call
him
should
anything
unforeseen
occur
and
after
that
almost
immediately
he
fell
asleep
as
indeed
did
the
most
of
the
men
from
the
time
that
i
relieved
the
until
midnight
i
sat
upon
the
gunnel
of
the
boat
with
the
steering
oar
under
my
arm
and
watched
and
listened
most
full
of
a
sense
of
the
strangeness
of
the
seas
into
which
we
had
come
it
is
true
that
i
had
heard
tell
of
seas
choked
up
with
weed
seas
that
were
full
of
stagnation
having
no
tides
but
i
had
not
thought
to
come
upon
such
an
one
in
my
wanderings
having
indeed
set
down
such
tales
as
being
bred
of
imagination
and
without
reality
in
fact
then
a
little
before
the
dawn
and
when
the
sea
was
yet
full
of
darkness
i
was
greatly
startled
to
hear
a
prodigious
splash
amid
the
weed
mayhaps
at
a
distance
of
some
hundred
yards
from
the
boat
then
as
i
stood
full
of
alertness
and
knowing
not
what
the
next
moment
might
bring
forth
there
came
to
me
across
the
immense
waste
of
weed
a
long
mournful
cry
and
then
again
the
silence
yet
though
i
kept
very
quiet
there
came
no
further
sound
and
i
was
about
to
myself
when
afar
off
in
that
strange
wilderness
there
flashed
out
a
sudden
flame
of
fire
now
upon
seeing
fire
in
the
midst
of
so
much
lonesomeness
i
was
as
one
amazed
and
could
do
naught
but
stare
then
my
judgment
returning
to
me
i
stooped
and
waked
the
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
was
a
matter
for
his
attention
he
after
staring
at
it
awhile
declared
that
he
could
see
the
shape
of
a
vessel
hull
beyond
the
flame
but
immediately
he
was
in
doubt
as
indeed
i
had
been
all
the
while
and
then
even
as
we
peered
the
light
vanished
and
though
we
waited
for
the
space
of
some
minutes
watching
steadfastly
there
came
no
further
sight
of
that
strange
illumination
from
now
until
the
dawn
the
remained
awake
with
me
and
we
talked
much
upon
that
which
we
had
seen
yet
could
come
to
no
satisfactory
conclusion
for
it
seemed
impossible
to
us
that
a
place
of
so
much
desolation
could
contain
any
living
being
and
then
just
as
the
dawn
was
upon
us
there
loomed
up
a
fresh
wonder
the
hull
of
a
great
vessel
maybe
a
couple
or
three
score
fathoms
in
from
the
edge
of
the
weed
now
the
wind
was
still
very
light
being
no
more
than
an
occasional
breath
so
that
we
went
past
her
at
a
drift
thus
the
dawn
had
strengthened
sufficiently
to
give
to
us
a
clear
sight
of
the
stranger
before
we
had
gone
more
than
a
little
past
her
and
now
i
perceived
that
she
lay
full
broadside
on
to
us
and
that
her
three
masts
were
gone
close
down
to
the
deck
her
side
was
streaked
in
places
with
rust
and
in
others
a
green
scum
overspread
her
but
it
was
no
more
than
a
glance
that
i
gave
at
any
of
those
matters
for
i
had
spied
something
which
drew
all
my
attention
great
leathery
arms
splayed
all
across
her
side
some
of
them
crooked
inboard
over
the
rail
and
then
low
down
seen
just
above
the
weed
the
huge
brown
glistening
bulk
of
so
great
a
monster
as
ever
i
had
conceived
the
saw
it
in
the
same
instant
and
cried
out
in
a
hoarse
whisper
that
it
was
a
mighty
devilfish
and
then
even
as
he
spoke
two
of
the
arms
flickered
up
into
the
cold
light
of
the
dawn
as
though
the
creature
had
been
asleep
and
we
had
waked
it
at
that
the
seized
an
oar
and
i
did
likewise
and
so
swiftly
as
we
dared
for
fear
of
making
any
unneedful
noise
we
pulled
the
boat
to
a
safer
distance
from
there
and
until
the
vessel
had
become
indistinct
by
reason
of
the
space
we
put
between
us
we
watched
that
great
creature
clutched
to
the
old
hull
as
it
might
be
a
limpet
to
a
rock
presently
when
it
was
broad
day
some
of
the
men
began
to
rouse
up
and
in
a
little
we
broke
our
fast
which
was
not
displeasing
to
me
who
had
spent
the
night
watching
and
so
through
the
day
we
sailed
with
a
very
light
wind
upon
our
larboard
quarter
and
all
the
while
we
kept
the
great
waste
of
weed
upon
our
starboard
side
and
apart
from
the
mainland
of
the
weed
as
it
were
there
were
scattered
about
an
uncountable
number
of
weed
islets
and
banks
and
there
were
thin
patches
of
it
that
appeared
scarce
above
the
water
and
through
these
later
we
let
the
boat
sail
for
they
had
not
sufficient
density
to
impede
our
progress
more
than
a
little
and
then
when
the
day
was
far
spent
we
came
in
sight
of
another
wreck
amid
the
weeds
she
lay
in
from
the
edge
perhaps
so
much
as
the
half
of
a
mile
and
she
had
all
three
of
her
lower
masts
in
and
her
lower
yards
squared
but
what
took
our
eyes
more
than
aught
else
was
a
great
superstructure
which
had
been
built
upward
from
her
rails
almost
to
her
main
tops
and
this
as
we
were
able
to
perceive
was
supported
by
ropes
let
down
from
the
yards
but
of
what
material
the
superstructure
was
composed
i
have
no
knowledge
for
it
was
so
with
some
form
of
green
stuff
as
was
so
much
of
the
hull
as
showed
above
the
weed
as
to
defy
our
guesses
and
because
of
this
growth
it
was
borne
upon
us
that
the
ship
must
have
been
lost
to
the
world
a
very
great
age
ago
at
this
suggestion
i
grew
full
of
solemn
thought
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
had
come
upon
the
cemetery
of
the
oceans
now
in
a
little
while
after
we
had
passed
this
ancient
craft
the
night
came
down
upon
us
and
we
prepared
for
sleep
and
because
the
boat
was
making
some
little
way
through
the
water
the
gave
out
that
each
of
us
should
stand
our
turn
at
the
and
that
he
was
to
be
called
should
any
fresh
matter
transpire
and
so
we
settled
down
for
the
night
and
owing
to
my
previous
sleeplessness
i
was
full
weary
so
that
i
knew
nothing
until
the
one
whom
i
was
to
relieve
shook
me
into
wakefulness
so
soon
as
i
was
fully
waked
i
perceived
that
a
low
moon
hung
above
the
horizon
and
shed
a
very
ghostly
light
across
the
great
weed
world
to
starboard
for
the
rest
the
night
was
exceeding
quiet
so
that
no
sound
came
to
me
in
all
that
ocean
save
the
rippling
of
the
water
upon
our
bends
as
the
boat
forged
slowly
along
and
so
i
settled
down
to
pass
the
time
ere
i
should
be
allowed
to
sleep
but
first
i
asked
the
man
whom
i
had
relieved
how
long
a
time
had
passed
since
to
which
he
replied
that
it
was
no
more
than
the
half
of
an
hour
and
after
that
i
questioned
whether
he
had
seen
aught
strange
amid
the
weed
during
his
time
at
the
oar
but
he
had
seen
nothing
except
that
once
he
had
fancied
a
light
had
shown
in
the
midst
of
the
waste
yet
it
could
have
been
naught
save
a
humor
of
the
imagination
though
apart
from
this
he
had
heard
a
strange
crying
a
little
after
midnight
and
twice
there
had
been
great
splashes
among
the
weed
and
after
that
he
fell
asleep
being
impatient
at
my
questioning
now
it
so
chanced
that
my
watch
had
come
just
before
the
dawn
for
which
i
was
full
of
thankfulness
being
in
that
frame
of
mind
when
the
dark
breeds
strange
and
unwholesome
fancies
yet
though
i
was
so
near
to
the
dawn
i
was
not
to
escape
free
of
the
eerie
influence
of
that
place
for
as
i
sat
running
my
gaze
to
and
fro
over
its
grey
immensity
it
came
to
me
that
there
were
strange
movements
among
the
weed
and
i
seemed
to
see
vaguely
as
one
may
see
things
in
dreams
dim
white
faces
peer
out
at
me
here
and
there
yet
my
common
sense
assured
me
that
i
was
but
deceived
by
the
uncertain
light
and
the
sleep
in
my
eyes
yet
for
all
that
it
put
my
nerves
on
the
quiver
a
little
later
there
came
to
my
ears
the
noise
of
a
very
great
splash
amid
the
weed
but
though
i
stared
with
intentness
i
could
nowhere
discern
aught
as
likely
to
be
the
cause
thereof
and
then
suddenly
between
me
and
the
moon
there
drove
up
from
out
of
that
great
waste
a
vast
bulk
flinging
huge
masses
of
weed
in
all
directions
it
seemed
to
be
no
more
than
a
hundred
fathoms
distant
and
against
the
moon
i
saw
the
outline
of
it
most
clearly
a
mighty
devilfish
then
it
had
fallen
back
once
more
with
a
prodigious
splash
and
so
the
quiet
fell
again
finding
me
sore
afraid
and
no
little
bewildered
that
so
monstrous
a
creature
could
leap
with
such
agility
and
then
in
my
fright
i
had
let
the
boat
come
near
to
the
edge
of
the
weed
there
came
a
subtle
stir
opposite
to
our
starboard
bow
and
something
slid
down
into
the
water
i
swayed
upon
the
oar
to
turn
the
boat
head
outward
and
with
the
same
movement
leant
forward
and
sideways
to
peer
bringing
my
face
near
to
the
boat
rail
in
the
same
instant
i
found
myself
looking
down
into
a
white
demoniac
face
human
save
that
the
mouth
and
nose
had
greatly
the
appearance
of
a
beak
the
thing
was
gripping
at
the
side
of
the
boat
with
two
flickering
hands
gripping
the
bare
smooth
outer
surface
in
a
way
that
woke
in
my
mind
a
sudden
memory
of
the
great
devilfish
which
had
clung
to
the
side
of
the
wreck
we
had
passed
in
the
previous
dawn
i
saw
the
face
come
up
towards
me
and
one
misshapen
hand
fluttered
almost
to
my
throat
and
there
came
a
sudden
hateful
reek
in
my
nostrils
foul
and
abominable
then
i
came
into
possession
of
my
faculties
and
drew
back
with
great
haste
and
a
wild
cry
of
fear
and
then
i
had
the
by
the
middle
and
was
smiting
downward
with
the
loom
over
the
side
of
the
boat
but
the
thing
was
gone
from
my
sight
i
remember
shouting
out
to
the
and
to
the
men
to
awake
and
then
the
had
me
by
the
shoulder
was
calling
in
my
ear
to
know
what
dire
thing
had
come
about
at
that
i
cried
out
that
i
did
not
know
and
presently
being
somewhat
calmer
i
told
them
of
the
thing
that
i
had
seen
but
even
as
i
told
of
it
there
seemed
to
be
no
truth
in
it
so
that
they
were
all
at
a
loss
to
know
whether
i
had
fallen
asleep
or
that
i
had
indeed
seen
a
devil
and
presently
the
dawn
was
upon
us
vii
the
island
in
the
weed
it
was
as
we
were
all
discussing
the
matter
of
the
devil
face
that
had
peered
up
at
me
out
of
the
water
that
job
the
ordinary
seaman
discovered
the
island
in
the
light
of
the
growing
dawn
and
seeing
it
sprang
to
his
feet
with
so
loud
a
cry
that
we
were
like
for
the
moment
to
have
thought
he
had
seen
a
second
demon
yet
when
we
made
discovery
of
that
which
he
had
already
perceived
we
checked
our
blame
at
his
sudden
shout
for
the
sight
of
land
after
so
much
desolation
made
us
very
warm
in
our
hearts
now
at
first
the
island
seemed
but
a
very
small
matter
for
we
did
not
know
at
that
time
that
we
viewed
it
from
its
end
yet
despite
this
we
took
to
our
oars
and
rowed
with
all
haste
towards
it
and
so
coming
nearer
were
able
to
see
that
it
had
a
greater
size
than
we
had
imagined
presently
having
cleared
the
end
of
it
and
keeping
to
that
side
which
was
further
from
the
great
mass
of
the
we
opened
out
a
bay
that
curved
inward
to
a
sandy
beach
most
seductive
to
our
tired
eyes
here
for
the
space
of
a
minute
we
paused
to
survey
the
prospect
and
i
saw
that
the
island
was
of
a
very
strange
shape
having
a
great
hump
of
black
rock
at
either
end
and
dipping
down
into
a
steep
valley
between
them
in
this
valley
there
seemed
to
be
a
deal
of
a
strange
vegetation
that
had
the
appearance
of
mighty
toadstools
and
down
nearer
the
beach
there
was
a
thick
grove
of
a
kind
of
very
tall
reed
and
these
we
discovered
afterwards
to
be
exceeding
tough
and
light
having
something
of
the
qualities
of
the
bamboo
regarding
the
beach
it
might
have
been
most
reasonably
supposed
that
it
would
be
very
thick
with
the
driftweed
but
this
was
not
so
at
least
not
at
that
time
though
a
projecting
horn
of
the
black
rock
which
ran
out
into
the
sea
from
the
upper
end
of
the
island
was
thick
with
it
and
now
the
having
assured
himself
that
there
was
no
appearance
of
any
danger
we
bent
to
our
oars
and
presently
had
the
boat
aground
upon
the
beach
and
here
finding
it
convenient
we
made
our
breakfast
during
this
meal
the
discussed
with
us
the
most
proper
thing
to
do
and
it
was
decided
to
push
the
boat
off
from
the
shore
leaving
job
in
her
whilst
the
remainder
of
us
made
some
exploration
of
the
island
and
so
having
made
an
end
of
eating
we
proceeded
as
we
had
determined
leaving
job
in
the
boat
ready
to
scull
ashore
for
us
if
we
were
pursued
by
any
savage
creature
while
the
rest
of
us
made
our
way
towards
the
nearer
hump
from
which
as
it
stood
some
hundred
feet
above
the
sea
we
hoped
to
get
a
very
good
idea
of
the
remainder
of
the
island
first
however
the
handed
out
to
us
the
two
cutlasses
and
the
the
other
two
cutlasses
being
in
josh
boat
and
taking
one
himself
he
passed
me
the
and
gave
the
other
cutlass
to
the
biggest
of
the
men
then
he
bade
the
others
keep
their
sheath
knives
handy
and
was
proceeding
to
lead
the
way
when
one
of
them
called
out
to
us
to
wait
a
moment
and
with
that
ran
quickly
to
the
clump
of
reeds
here
he
took
one
with
both
his
hands
and
bent
upon
it
but
it
would
not
break
so
that
he
had
to
notch
it
about
with
his
knife
and
thus
in
a
little
he
had
it
clear
after
this
he
cut
off
the
upper
part
which
was
too
thin
and
lissome
for
his
purpose
and
then
thrust
the
handle
of
his
knife
into
the
end
of
the
portion
which
he
had
retained
and
in
this
wise
he
had
a
most
serviceable
lance
or
spear
for
the
reeds
were
very
strong
and
hollow
after
the
fashion
of
bamboo
and
when
he
had
bound
some
yarn
about
the
end
into
which
he
had
thrust
his
knife
so
as
to
prevent
it
splitting
it
was
a
fit
enough
weapon
for
any
man
now
the
perceiving
the
happiness
of
the
fellow
idea
bade
the
rest
make
to
themselves
similar
weapons
and
whilst
they
were
busy
thus
he
commended
the
man
very
warmly
and
so
in
a
little
being
now
most
comfortably
armed
we
made
inland
towards
the
nearer
black
hill
in
very
good
spirits
presently
we
were
come
to
the
rock
which
formed
the
hill
and
found
that
it
came
up
out
of
the
sand
with
great
abruptness
so
that
we
could
not
climb
it
on
the
seaward
side
at
that
the
led
us
round
a
space
towards
that
side
where
lay
the
valley
and
here
there
was
neither
sand
nor
rock
but
ground
of
strange
and
spongy
texture
and
then
suddenly
rounding
a
jutting
spur
of
the
rock
we
came
upon
the
first
of
the
vegetation
an
incredible
mushroom
nay
i
should
say
toadstool
for
it
had
no
healthy
look
about
it
and
gave
out
a
heavy
mouldy
odor
and
now
we
perceived
that
the
valley
was
filled
with
them
all
that
is
save
a
great
circular
patch
where
nothing
appeared
to
be
growing
though
we
were
not
yet
at
a
sufficient
height
to
ascertain
the
reason
of
this
presently
we
came
to
a
place
where
the
rock
was
split
by
a
great
fissure
running
up
to
the
top
and
showing
many
ledges
and
convenient
shelves
upon
which
we
might
obtain
hold
and
footing
and
so
we
about
climbing
helping
one
another
so
far
as
we
had
ability
until
in
about
the
space
of
some
ten
minutes
we
reached
the
top
and
from
thence
had
a
very
fine
view
we
perceived
now
that
there
was
a
beach
upon
that
side
of
the
island
which
was
opposed
to
the
weed
though
unlike
that
upon
which
we
had
landed
it
was
greatly
choked
with
weed
which
had
drifted
ashore
after
that
i
gave
notice
to
see
what
space
of
water
lay
between
the
island
and
the
edge
of
the
great
and
guessed
it
to
be
no
more
than
maybe
some
ninety
yards
at
which
i
fell
to
wishing
that
it
had
been
greater
for
i
was
grown
much
in
awe
of
the
weed
and
the
strange
things
which
i
conceived
it
to
contain
abruptly
the
clapped
me
upon
the
shoulder
and
pointed
to
some
object
that
lay
out
in
the
weed
at
a
distance
of
not
much
less
than
the
half
of
a
mile
from
where
we
stood
now
at
first
i
could
not
conceive
what
manner
of
thing
it
was
at
which
i
stared
until
the
remarking
my
bewilderment
informed
me
that
it
was
a
vessel
all
covered
in
no
doubt
as
a
protection
against
the
and
other
strange
creatures
in
the
weed
and
now
i
began
to
trace
the
hull
of
her
amid
all
that
hideous
growth
but
of
her
masts
i
could
discern
nothing
and
i
doubted
not
but
that
they
had
been
carried
away
by
some
storm
ere
she
was
caught
by
the
weed
and
then
the
thought
came
to
me
of
the
end
of
those
who
had
built
up
that
protection
against
the
horrors
which
the
held
hidden
amid
its
slime
presently
i
turned
my
gaze
once
more
upon
the
island
which
was
very
plain
to
see
from
where
we
stood
i
conceived
now
that
i
could
see
so
much
of
it
that
its
length
would
be
near
to
half
a
mile
though
its
breadth
was
something
under
four
hundred
yards
thus
it
was
very
long
in
proportion
to
its
width
in
the
middle
part
it
had
less
breadth
than
at
the
ends
being
perhaps
three
hundred
yards
at
its
narrowest
and
a
hundred
yards
wider
at
its
broadest
upon
both
sides
of
the
island
as
i
have
made
already
a
mention
there
was
a
beach
though
this
extended
no
great
distance
along
the
shore
the
remainder
being
composed
of
the
black
rock
of
which
the
hills
were
formed
and
now
having
a
closer
regard
to
the
beach
upon
the
of
the
island
i
discovered
amid
the
wrack
that
had
been
cast
ashore
a
portion
of
the
lower
mast
and
topmast
of
some
great
ship
with
rigging
attached
but
the
yards
were
all
gone
this
find
i
pointed
out
to
the
remarking
that
it
might
prove
of
use
for
firing
but
he
smiled
at
me
telling
me
that
the
dried
weed
would
make
a
very
abundant
fire
and
this
without
going
to
the
labor
of
cutting
the
mast
into
suitable
logs
and
now
he
in
turn
called
my
attention
to
the
place
where
the
huge
fungi
had
come
to
a
stop
in
their
growing
and
i
saw
that
in
the
center
of
the
valley
there
was
a
great
circular
opening
in
the
earth
like
to
the
mouth
of
a
prodigious
pit
and
it
appeared
to
be
filled
to
within
a
few
feet
of
the
mouth
with
water
over
which
spread
a
brown
and
horrid
scum
now
as
may
be
supposed
i
stared
with
some
intentness
at
this
for
it
had
the
look
of
having
been
made
with
labor
being
very
symmetrical
yet
i
could
not
conceive
but
that
i
was
deluded
by
the
distance
and
that
it
would
have
a
rougher
appearance
when
viewed
from
a
nearer
standpoint
from
contemplating
this
i
looked
down
upon
the
little
bay
in
which
our
boat
floated
job
was
sitting
in
the
stern
sculling
gently
with
the
steering
oar
and
watching
us
at
that
i
waved
my
hand
to
him
in
friendly
fashion
and
he
waved
back
and
then
even
as
i
looked
i
saw
something
in
the
water
under
the
boat
something
dark
colored
that
was
all
of
the
boat
appeared
to
be
floating
over
it
as
over
a
mass
of
sunk
weed
and
then
i
saw
that
whatever
it
was
it
was
rising
to
the
surface
at
this
a
sudden
horror
came
over
me
and
i
clutched
the
by
the
arm
and
pointed
crying
out
that
there
was
something
under
the
boat
now
the
so
soon
as
he
saw
the
thing
ran
forward
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
placing
his
hands
to
his
mouth
after
the
fashion
of
a
trumpet
sang
out
to
the
boy
to
bring
the
boat
to
the
shore
and
make
fast
the
painter
to
a
large
piece
of
rock
at
the
hail
the
lad
called
out
i
i
and
standing
up
gave
a
sweep
with
his
oar
that
brought
the
boat
head
round
towards
the
beach
fortunately
for
him
he
was
no
more
than
some
thirty
yards
from
the
shore
at
this
time
else
he
had
never
come
to
it
in
this
life
for
the
next
moment
the
moving
brown
mass
beneath
the
boat
shot
out
a
great
tentacle
and
the
oar
was
torn
out
of
job
hands
with
such
power
as
to
throw
him
right
over
on
to
the
starboard
gunnel
of
the
boat
the
oar
itself
was
drawn
down
out
of
sight
and
for
the
minute
the
boat
was
left
untouched
now
the
cried
out
to
the
boy
to
take
another
oar
and
get
ashore
while
still
he
had
chance
and
at
that
we
all
called
out
various
things
one
advising
one
thing
and
another
recommending
some
other
yet
our
advice
was
vain
for
the
boy
moved
not
at
which
some
cried
out
that
he
was
stunned
i
looked
now
to
where
the
brown
thing
had
been
for
the
boat
had
moved
a
few
fathoms
from
the
spot
having
got
some
way
upon
her
before
the
oar
was
snatched
and
thus
i
discovered
that
the
monster
had
disappeared
having
i
conceived
sunk
again
into
the
depths
from
which
it
had
risen
yet
it
might
at
any
moment
and
in
that
case
the
boy
would
be
taken
before
our
eyes
at
this
juncture
the
called
to
us
to
follow
him
and
led
the
way
to
the
great
fissure
up
which
we
had
climbed
and
so
in
a
minute
we
were
each
of
us
scrambling
down
with
what
haste
we
could
make
towards
the
valley
and
all
the
while
as
i
dropped
from
ledge
to
ledge
i
was
full
of
torment
to
know
whether
the
monster
had
returned
the
was
the
first
man
to
reach
the
bottom
of
the
cleft
and
he
set
off
immediately
round
the
base
of
the
rock
to
the
beach
the
rest
of
us
following
him
as
we
made
safe
our
footing
in
the
valley
i
was
the
third
man
down
but
being
light
and
fleet
of
foot
i
passed
the
second
man
and
caught
up
with
the
just
as
he
came
upon
the
sand
here
i
found
that
the
boat
was
within
some
five
fathoms
of
the
beach
and
i
could
see
job
still
lying
insensible
but
of
the
monster
there
was
no
sign
and
so
matters
were
the
boat
nearly
a
dozen
yards
from
the
shore
and
job
lying
insensible
in
her
with
somewhere
near
under
her
keel
for
all
that
we
knew
a
great
monster
and
we
helpless
upon
the
beach
now
i
could
not
imagine
how
to
save
the
lad
and
indeed
i
fear
he
had
been
left
to
destruction
for
i
had
deemed
it
madness
to
try
to
reach
the
boat
by
swimming
but
for
the
extraordinary
bravery
of
the
who
without
hesitating
dashed
into
the
water
and
swam
boldly
out
to
the
boat
which
by
the
grace
of
god
he
reached
without
mishap
and
climbed
in
over
the
bows
immediately
he
took
the
painter
and
hove
it
to
us
bidding
us
tail
on
to
it
and
bring
the
boat
to
shore
without
delay
and
by
this
method
of
gaining
the
beach
he
showed
wisdom
for
in
this
wise
he
escaped
attracting
the
attention
of
the
monster
by
unneedful
stirring
of
the
water
as
he
would
surely
have
done
had
he
made
use
of
an
oar
yet
despite
his
care
we
had
not
finished
with
the
creature
for
just
as
the
boat
grounded
i
saw
the
lost
steering
oar
shoot
up
half
its
length
out
of
the
sea
and
immediately
there
was
a
mighty
splather
in
the
water
astern
and
the
next
instant
the
air
seemed
full
of
huge
whirling
arms
at
that
the
gave
one
look
behind
and
seeing
the
thing
upon
him
snatched
the
boy
into
his
arms
and
sprang
over
the
bows
on
to
the
sand
now
at
sight
of
the
we
had
all
made
for
the
back
of
the
beach
at
a
run
none
troubling
even
to
retain
the
painter
and
because
of
this
we
were
like
to
have
lost
the
boat
for
the
great
cuttlefish
had
its
arms
all
splayed
about
it
seeming
to
have
a
mind
to
drag
it
down
into
the
deep
water
from
whence
it
had
risen
and
it
had
possibly
succeeded
but
that
the
brought
us
all
to
our
senses
for
having
laid
job
out
of
harm
way
he
was
the
first
to
seize
the
painter
which
lay
trailed
upon
the
sand
and
at
that
we
got
back
our
courage
and
ran
to
assist
him
now
there
happened
to
be
convenient
a
great
spike
of
rock
the
same
indeed
to
which
the
had
bidden
job
tie
the
boat
and
to
this
we
ran
the
painter
taking
a
couple
of
turns
about
it
and
two
and
now
unless
the
rope
carried
away
we
had
no
reason
to
fear
the
loss
of
the
boat
though
there
seemed
to
us
to
be
a
danger
of
the
crushing
it
because
of
this
and
because
of
a
feeling
of
natural
anger
against
the
thing
the
took
up
from
the
sand
one
of
the
spears
which
had
been
cast
down
when
we
hauled
the
boat
ashore
with
this
he
went
down
so
far
as
seemed
safe
and
prodded
the
creature
in
one
of
its
tentacles
the
weapon
entering
easily
at
which
i
was
surprised
for
i
had
understood
that
these
monsters
were
near
to
invulnerable
in
all
parts
save
their
eyes
at
receiving
this
stab
the
great
fish
appeared
to
feel
no
hurt
for
it
showed
no
signs
of
pain
and
at
that
the
was
further
emboldened
to
go
nearer
so
that
he
might
deliver
a
more
deadly
wound
yet
scarce
had
he
taken
two
steps
before
the
hideous
thing
was
upon
him
and
but
for
an
agility
wonderful
in
so
great
a
man
he
had
been
destroyed
yet
spite
of
so
narrow
an
escape
from
death
he
was
not
the
less
determined
to
wound
or
destroy
the
creature
and
to
this
end
he
dispatched
some
of
us
to
the
grove
of
reeds
to
get
half
a
dozen
of
the
strongest
and
when
we
returned
with
these
he
bade
two
of
the
men
lash
their
spears
securely
to
them
and
by
this
means
they
had
now
spears
of
a
length
of
between
thirty
and
forty
feet
with
these
it
was
possible
to
attack
the
devilfish
without
coming
within
reach
of
its
tentacles
and
now
being
ready
he
took
one
of
the
spears
telling
the
biggest
of
the
men
to
take
the
other
then
he
directed
him
to
aim
for
the
right
eye
of
the
huge
fish
whilst
he
would
attack
the
left
now
since
the
creature
had
so
nearly
captured
the
it
had
ceased
to
tug
at
the
boat
and
lay
silent
with
its
tentacles
spread
all
about
it
and
its
great
eyes
appearing
just
over
the
stern
so
that
it
presented
an
appearance
of
watching
our
movements
though
i
doubt
if
it
saw
us
with
any
clearness
for
it
must
have
been
dazed
with
the
brightness
of
the
sunshine
and
now
the
gave
the
signal
to
attack
at
which
he
and
the
man
ran
down
upon
the
creature
with
their
lances
as
it
were
in
rest
the
spear
took
the
monster
truly
in
its
left
eye
but
the
one
wielded
by
the
man
was
too
bendable
and
sagged
so
much
that
it
struck
the
of
the
boat
the
knife
blade
snapping
off
short
yet
it
mattered
not
for
the
wound
inflicted
by
the
weapon
was
so
frightful
that
the
giant
cuttlefish
released
the
boat
and
slid
back
into
deep
water
churning
it
into
foam
and
gouting
blood
for
some
minutes
we
waited
to
make
sure
that
the
monster
had
indeed
gone
and
after
that
we
hastened
to
the
boat
and
drew
her
up
so
far
as
we
were
able
after
which
we
unloaded
the
heaviest
of
her
contents
and
so
were
able
to
get
her
right
clear
of
the
water
and
for
an
hour
afterwards
the
sea
all
about
the
little
beach
was
stained
black
and
in
places
red
viii
the
noises
in
the
valley
now
so
soon
as
we
had
gotten
the
boat
into
safety
the
which
we
did
with
a
most
feverish
haste
the
gave
his
attention
to
job
for
the
boy
had
not
yet
recovered
from
the
blow
which
the
loom
of
the
oar
had
dealt
him
beneath
the
chin
when
the
monster
snatched
at
it
for
awhile
his
attentions
produced
no
effect
but
presently
having
bathed
the
face
with
water
from
the
sea
and
rubbed
rum
into
his
chest
over
the
heart
the
youth
began
to
show
signs
of
life
and
soon
opened
his
eyes
whereupon
the
gave
him
a
stiff
jorum
of
the
rum
after
which
he
asked
him
how
he
seemed
in
himself
to
this
job
replied
in
a
weak
voice
that
he
was
dizzy
and
his
head
and
neck
ached
badly
on
hearing
which
the
bade
him
keep
lying
until
he
had
come
more
to
himself
and
so
we
left
him
in
quietness
under
a
little
shade
of
canvas
and
reeds
for
the
air
was
warm
and
the
sand
dry
and
he
was
not
like
to
come
to
any
harm
there
at
a
little
distance
under
the
directing
of
the
we
made
to
prepare
dinner
for
we
were
now
very
hungry
it
seeming
a
great
while
since
we
had
broken
our
fast
to
this
end
the
sent
two
of
the
men
across
the
island
to
gather
some
of
the
dry
seaweed
for
we
intended
to
cook
some
of
the
salt
meat
this
being
the
first
cooked
meal
since
ending
the
meat
which
we
had
boiled
before
leaving
the
ship
in
the
creek
in
the
meanwhile
and
until
the
return
of
the
men
with
the
fuel
the
kept
us
busied
in
various
ways
two
he
sent
to
cut
a
bundle
of
the
reeds
and
another
couple
to
bring
the
meat
and
the
iron
boiler
the
latter
being
one
that
we
had
taken
from
the
old
brig
presently
the
men
returned
with
the
dried
seaweed
and
very
curious
stuff
it
seemed
some
of
it
being
in
chunks
near
as
thick
as
a
body
but
exceeding
brittle
by
reason
of
its
dryness
and
so
in
a
little
we
had
a
very
good
fire
going
which
we
fed
with
the
seaweed
and
pieces
of
the
reeds
though
we
found
the
latter
to
be
but
indifferent
fuel
having
too
much
sap
and
being
troublesome
to
break
into
convenient
size
now
when
the
fire
had
grown
red
and
hot
the
half
filled
the
boiler
with
sea
water
in
which
he
placed
the
meat
and
the
pan
having
a
stout
lid
he
did
not
scruple
to
place
it
in
the
very
heart
of
the
fire
so
that
soon
we
had
the
contents
boiling
merrily
having
gotten
the
dinner
under
way
the
set
about
preparing
our
camp
for
the
night
which
we
did
by
making
a
rough
framework
with
the
reeds
over
which
we
spread
the
boat
sails
and
the
cover
pegging
the
canvas
down
with
tough
splinters
of
the
reed
when
this
was
completed
we
and
carried
there
all
our
stores
after
which
the
took
us
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
island
to
gather
fuel
for
the
night
which
we
did
each
man
bearing
a
great
double
armful
now
by
the
time
that
we
had
brought
over
each
of
us
two
loads
of
the
fuel
we
found
the
meat
to
be
cooked
and
so
without
more
set
ourselves
down
and
made
a
very
good
meal
off
it
and
some
biscuits
after
which
we
had
each
of
us
a
sound
tot
of
the
rum
having
made
an
end
of
eating
and
drinking
the
went
over
to
where
job
lay
to
inquire
how
he
felt
and
found
him
lying
very
quiet
though
his
breathing
had
a
heavy
touch
about
it
however
we
could
conceive
of
nothing
by
which
he
might
be
bettered
and
so
left
him
being
more
hopeful
that
nature
would
bring
him
to
health
than
any
skill
of
which
we
were
possessed
by
this
time
it
was
late
afternoon
so
that
the
declared
we
might
please
ourselves
until
sunset
deeming
that
we
had
earned
a
very
good
right
to
rest
but
that
from
sunset
till
the
dawn
we
should
he
told
us
have
each
of
us
to
take
turn
and
turn
about
to
watch
for
though
we
were
no
longer
upon
the
water
none
might
say
whether
we
were
out
of
danger
or
not
as
witness
the
happening
of
the
morning
though
certainly
he
apprehended
no
danger
from
the
so
long
as
we
kept
well
away
from
the
water
edge
and
so
from
now
until
dark
most
of
the
men
slept
but
the
spent
much
of
that
time
in
overhauling
the
boat
to
see
how
it
might
chance
to
have
suffered
during
the
storm
and
also
whether
the
struggles
of
the
had
strained
it
in
any
way
and
indeed
it
was
speedily
evident
that
the
boat
would
need
some
attention
for
the
plank
in
her
bottom
next
but
one
to
the
keel
upon
the
starboard
side
had
been
burst
inwards
this
having
been
done
it
would
seem
by
some
rock
in
the
beach
hidden
just
beneath
the
water
edge
the
having
no
doubt
ground
the
boat
down
upon
it
happily
the
damage
was
not
great
though
it
would
most
certainly
have
to
be
carefully
repaired
before
the
boat
would
be
again
seaworthy
for
the
rest
there
seemed
to
be
no
other
part
needing
attention
now
i
had
not
felt
any
call
to
sleep
and
so
had
followed
the
to
the
boat
giving
him
a
hand
to
remove
the
and
finally
to
slue
her
bottom
a
little
upwards
so
that
he
might
examine
the
leak
more
closely
when
he
had
made
an
end
with
the
boat
he
went
over
to
the
stores
and
looked
closely
into
their
condition
and
also
to
see
how
they
were
lasting
and
after
that
he
sounded
all
the
having
done
which
he
remarked
that
it
would
be
well
for
us
if
we
could
discover
any
fresh
water
upon
the
island
by
this
time
it
was
getting
on
towards
evening
and
the
went
across
to
look
at
job
finding
him
much
as
he
had
been
when
we
visited
him
after
dinner
at
that
the
asked
me
to
bring
across
one
of
the
longer
of
the
which
i
did
and
we
made
use
of
it
as
a
stretcher
to
carry
the
lad
into
the
tent
and
afterwards
we
carried
all
the
loose
woodwork
of
the
boat
into
the
tent
emptying
the
lockers
of
their
contents
which
included
some
oakum
a
small
boat
hatchet
a
coil
of
hemp
line
a
good
saw
an
empty
tin
a
bag
of
copper
nails
some
bolts
and
washers
two
three
spare
tholes
a
grain
without
the
shaft
two
balls
of
spun
yarn
three
hanks
of
a
piece
of
canvas
with
four
stuck
in
it
the
boat
lamp
a
spare
plug
and
a
roll
of
light
duck
for
making
boat
sails
and
so
presently
the
dark
came
down
upon
the
island
at
which
the
waked
the
men
and
bade
them
throw
more
fuel
on
to
the
fire
which
had
burned
down
to
a
mound
of
glowing
embers
much
shrouded
in
ash
after
that
one
of
them
part
filled
the
boiler
with
fresh
water
and
soon
we
were
occupied
most
pleasantly
upon
a
supper
of
cold
boiled
hard
biscuits
and
rum
mixed
with
hot
water
during
supper
the
made
clear
to
the
men
regarding
the
watches
arranging
how
they
should
follow
so
that
i
found
i
was
set
down
to
take
my
turn
from
midnight
until
one
of
the
clock
then
he
explained
to
them
about
the
burst
plank
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
how
that
it
would
have
to
be
put
right
before
we
could
hope
to
leave
the
island
and
that
after
that
night
we
should
have
to
go
most
strictly
with
the
victuals
for
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
upon
the
island
that
we
had
up
till
then
discovered
fit
to
satisfy
our
bellies
more
than
this
if
we
could
find
no
fresh
water
he
should
have
to
distil
some
to
make
up
for
that
which
we
had
drunk
and
this
must
be
done
before
leaving
the
island
now
by
the
time
that
the
had
made
an
end
of
explaining
these
matters
we
had
ceased
from
eating
and
soon
after
this
we
made
each
one
of
us
a
comfortable
place
in
the
sand
within
the
tent
and
lay
down
to
sleep
for
a
while
i
found
myself
very
wakeful
which
may
have
been
because
of
the
warmth
of
the
night
and
indeed
at
last
i
got
up
and
went
out
of
the
tent
conceiving
that
i
might
the
better
find
sleep
in
the
open
air
and
so
it
proved
for
having
lain
down
at
the
side
of
the
tent
a
little
way
from
the
fire
i
fell
soon
into
a
deep
slumber
which
at
first
was
dreamless
presently
however
i
came
upon
a
very
strange
and
unsettling
dream
for
i
dreamed
that
i
had
been
left
alone
on
the
island
and
was
sitting
very
desolate
upon
the
edge
of
the
pit
then
i
was
aware
suddenly
that
it
was
very
dark
and
very
silent
and
i
began
to
shiver
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
something
which
repulsed
my
whole
being
had
come
quietly
behind
me
at
that
i
tried
mightily
to
turn
and
look
into
the
shadows
among
the
great
fungi
that
stood
all
about
me
but
i
had
no
power
to
turn
and
the
thing
was
coming
nearer
though
never
a
sound
came
to
me
and
i
gave
out
a
scream
or
tried
to
but
my
voice
made
no
stir
in
the
rounding
quiet
and
then
something
wet
and
cold
touched
my
face
and
slithered
down
and
covered
my
mouth
and
paused
there
for
a
vile
breathless
moment
it
passed
onward
and
fell
to
my
throat
and
stayed
there
some
one
stumbled
and
felt
over
my
feet
and
at
that
i
was
suddenly
awake
it
was
the
man
on
watch
making
a
walk
round
the
back
of
the
tent
and
he
had
not
known
of
my
presence
till
he
fell
over
my
boots
he
was
somewhat
shaken
and
startled
as
might
be
supposed
but
steadied
himself
on
learning
that
it
was
no
wild
creature
crouched
there
in
the
shadow
and
all
the
time
as
i
answered
his
inquiries
i
was
full
of
a
strange
horrid
feeling
that
something
had
left
me
at
the
moment
of
my
awakening
there
was
a
slight
hateful
odor
in
my
nostrils
that
was
not
altogether
unfamiliar
and
then
suddenly
i
was
aware
that
my
face
was
damp
and
that
there
was
a
curious
sense
of
tingling
at
my
throat
i
put
up
my
hand
and
felt
my
face
and
the
hand
when
i
brought
it
away
was
slippery
with
slime
and
at
that
i
put
up
my
other
hand
and
touched
my
throat
and
there
it
was
the
same
only
in
addition
there
was
a
slight
swelled
place
a
little
to
one
side
of
the
the
sort
of
place
that
the
bite
of
a
mosquito
will
make
but
i
had
no
thought
to
blame
any
mosquito
now
the
stumbling
of
the
man
over
me
my
awakening
and
the
discovery
that
my
face
and
throat
were
were
but
the
happenings
of
some
few
short
instants
and
then
i
was
upon
my
feet
and
following
him
round
to
the
fire
for
i
had
a
sense
of
chilliness
and
a
great
desire
not
to
be
alone
now
having
come
to
the
fire
i
took
some
of
the
water
that
had
been
left
in
the
boiler
and
washed
my
face
and
neck
after
which
i
felt
more
my
own
man
then
i
asked
the
man
to
look
at
my
throat
so
that
he
might
give
me
some
idea
of
what
manner
of
place
the
swelling
seemed
and
he
lighting
a
piece
of
the
dry
seaweed
to
act
as
a
torch
made
examination
of
my
neck
but
could
see
little
save
a
number
of
small
marks
red
inwardly
and
white
at
the
edges
and
one
of
them
was
bleeding
slightly
after
that
i
asked
him
whether
he
had
seen
anything
moving
round
the
tent
but
he
had
seen
nothing
during
all
the
time
that
he
had
been
on
watch
though
it
was
true
that
he
had
heard
odd
noises
but
nothing
very
near
at
hand
of
the
places
on
my
throat
he
seemed
to
think
but
little
suggesting
that
i
had
been
bitten
by
some
sort
of
but
at
that
i
shook
my
head
and
told
him
of
my
dream
and
after
that
he
was
as
anxious
to
keep
near
me
as
i
to
him
and
so
the
night
passed
onward
until
my
turn
came
to
watch
for
a
little
while
the
man
whom
i
had
relieved
sat
beside
me
having
i
conceived
the
kindly
intent
of
keeping
me
company
but
so
soon
as
i
perceived
this
i
entreated
him
to
go
and
get
his
sleep
assuring
him
that
i
had
no
longer
any
feelings
of
fear
such
as
had
been
mine
upon
awakening
and
discovering
the
state
of
my
face
and
throat
and
upon
this
he
consented
to
leave
me
and
so
in
a
little
i
sat
alone
beside
the
fire
for
a
certain
space
i
kept
very
quiet
listening
but
no
sound
came
to
me
out
of
the
surrounding
darkness
and
so
as
though
it
were
a
fresh
thing
it
was
borne
in
upon
me
how
that
we
were
in
a
very
abominable
place
of
lonesomeness
and
desolation
and
i
grew
very
solemn
thus
as
i
sat
the
fire
which
had
not
been
replenished
for
a
while
dwindled
steadily
until
it
gave
but
a
dullish
glow
around
and
then
in
the
direction
of
the
valley
i
heard
suddenly
the
sound
of
a
dull
thud
the
noise
coming
to
me
through
the
stillness
with
a
very
startling
clearness
at
that
i
perceived
that
i
was
not
doing
my
duty
to
the
rest
nor
to
myself
by
sitting
and
allowing
the
fire
to
cease
from
flaming
and
immediately
reproaching
myself
i
seized
and
cast
a
mass
of
the
dry
weed
upon
the
fire
so
that
a
great
blaze
shot
up
into
the
night
and
afterwards
i
glanced
quickly
to
right
and
to
left
holding
my
very
readily
and
most
thankful
to
the
almighty
that
i
had
brought
no
harm
to
any
by
reason
of
my
carelessness
which
i
incline
me
to
believe
was
that
strange
inertia
which
is
bred
by
fear
and
then
even
as
i
looked
about
me
there
came
to
me
across
the
silence
of
the
beach
a
fresh
noise
a
continual
soft
slithering
to
and
fro
in
the
bottom
of
the
valley
as
though
a
multitude
of
creatures
moved
stealthily
at
this
i
threw
yet
more
fuel
upon
the
fire
and
after
that
i
fixed
my
gaze
in
the
direction
of
the
valley
thus
in
the
following
instant
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
saw
a
certain
thing
as
it
might
be
a
shadow
move
on
the
outer
borders
of
the
firelight
now
the
man
who
had
kept
watch
before
me
had
left
his
spear
stuck
upright
in
the
sand
convenient
to
my
grasp
and
seeing
something
moving
i
seized
the
weapon
and
hurled
it
with
all
my
strength
in
its
direction
but
there
came
no
answering
cry
to
tell
that
i
had
struck
anything
living
and
immediately
afterwards
there
fell
once
more
a
great
silence
upon
the
island
being
broken
only
by
a
far
splash
out
upon
the
weed
it
may
be
conceived
with
truth
that
the
above
happenings
had
put
a
very
considerable
strain
upon
my
nerves
so
that
i
looked
to
and
fro
continually
with
ever
and
anon
a
quick
glance
behind
me
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
might
expect
some
demoniac
creature
to
rush
upon
me
at
any
moment
yet
for
the
space
of
many
minutes
there
came
to
me
neither
any
sight
nor
sound
of
living
creature
so
that
i
knew
not
what
to
think
being
near
to
doubting
if
i
had
heard
aught
beyond
the
common
and
then
even
as
i
made
halt
upon
the
threshold
of
doubt
i
was
assured
that
i
had
not
been
mistaken
for
abruptly
i
was
aware
that
all
the
valley
was
full
of
a
rustling
scampering
sort
of
noise
through
which
there
came
to
me
occasional
soft
thuds
and
anon
the
former
slithering
sounds
and
at
that
thinking
a
host
of
evil
things
to
be
upon
us
i
cried
out
to
the
and
the
men
to
awake
immediately
upon
my
shout
the
rushed
out
from
the
tent
the
men
following
and
every
one
with
his
weapon
save
the
man
who
had
left
his
spear
in
the
sand
and
that
lay
now
somewhere
beyond
the
light
of
the
fire
then
the
shouted
to
know
what
thing
had
caused
me
to
cry
out
but
i
replied
nothing
only
held
up
my
hand
for
quietness
yet
when
this
was
granted
the
noises
in
the
valley
had
ceased
so
that
the
turned
to
me
being
in
need
of
some
explanation
but
i
begged
him
to
hark
a
little
longer
which
he
did
and
the
sounds
almost
immediately
he
heard
sufficient
to
know
that
i
had
not
waked
them
all
without
due
cause
and
then
as
we
stood
each
one
of
us
staring
into
the
darkness
where
lay
the
valley
i
seemed
to
see
again
some
shadowy
thing
upon
the
boundary
of
the
firelight
and
in
the
same
instant
one
of
the
men
cried
out
and
cast
his
spear
into
the
darkness
but
the
turned
upon
him
with
a
very
great
anger
for
in
throwing
his
weapon
the
man
had
left
himself
without
and
thus
brought
danger
to
the
whole
yet
as
will
be
remembered
i
had
done
likewise
but
a
little
since
presently
there
coming
again
a
quietness
within
the
valley
and
none
knowing
what
might
be
toward
the
caught
up
a
mass
of
the
dry
weed
and
lighting
it
at
the
fire
ran
with
it
towards
that
portion
of
the
beach
which
lay
between
us
and
the
valley
here
he
cast
it
upon
the
sand
singing
out
to
some
of
the
men
to
bring
more
of
the
weed
so
that
we
might
have
a
fire
there
and
thus
be
able
to
see
if
anything
made
to
come
at
us
out
of
the
deepness
of
the
hollow
presently
we
had
a
very
good
fire
and
by
the
light
of
this
the
two
spears
were
discovered
both
of
them
stuck
in
the
sand
and
no
more
than
a
yard
one
from
the
other
which
seemed
to
me
a
very
strange
thing
now
for
a
while
after
the
lighting
of
the
second
fire
there
came
no
further
sounds
from
the
direction
of
the
valley
nothing
indeed
to
break
the
quietness
of
the
island
save
the
occasional
lonely
splashes
that
sounded
from
time
to
time
out
in
the
vastness
of
the
then
about
an
hour
after
i
had
waked
the
one
of
the
men
who
had
been
tending
the
fires
came
up
to
him
to
say
that
we
had
come
to
the
end
of
our
supply
of
at
that
the
looked
very
blank
the
which
did
the
rest
of
us
as
well
we
might
yet
there
was
no
help
for
it
until
one
of
the
men
bethought
him
of
the
remainder
of
the
bundle
of
reeds
which
we
had
cut
and
which
burning
but
poorly
we
had
discarded
for
the
weed
this
was
discovered
at
the
back
of
the
tent
and
with
it
we
fed
the
fire
that
burned
between
us
and
the
valley
but
the
other
we
suffered
to
die
out
for
the
reeds
were
not
sufficient
to
support
even
the
one
until
the
dawn
at
last
and
whilst
it
was
still
dark
we
came
to
the
end
of
our
fuel
and
as
the
fire
died
down
so
did
the
noises
in
the
valley
recommence
and
there
we
stood
in
the
growing
dark
each
one
keeping
a
very
ready
weapon
and
a
more
ready
glance
and
at
times
the
island
would
be
mightily
quiet
and
then
again
the
sounds
of
things
crawling
in
the
valley
yet
i
think
the
silences
tried
us
the
more
and
so
at
last
came
the
dawn
ix
what
happened
in
the
dusk
now
with
the
coming
of
the
dawn
a
lasting
silence
stole
across
the
island
and
into
the
valley
and
conceiving
that
we
had
nothing
more
to
fear
the
bade
us
get
some
rest
whilst
he
kept
watch
and
so
i
got
at
last
a
very
substantial
little
spell
of
sleep
which
made
me
fit
enough
for
the
day
work
presently
after
some
hours
had
passed
the
roused
us
to
go
with
him
to
the
further
side
of
the
island
to
gather
fuel
and
soon
we
were
back
with
each
a
load
so
that
in
a
little
we
had
the
fire
going
right
merrily
now
for
breakfast
we
had
a
hash
of
broken
biscuit
salt
meat
and
some
which
the
had
picked
up
from
the
beach
at
the
foot
of
the
further
hill
the
whole
being
right
liberally
flavored
with
some
of
the
vinegar
which
the
said
would
help
keep
down
any
scurvy
that
might
be
threatening
us
and
at
the
end
of
the
meal
he
served
out
to
us
each
a
little
of
the
molasses
which
we
mixed
with
hot
water
and
drank
the
meal
being
ended
he
went
into
the
tent
to
take
a
look
at
job
the
which
he
had
done
already
in
the
early
morning
for
the
condition
of
the
lad
preyed
somewhat
upon
him
he
being
for
all
his
size
and
a
man
of
surprisingly
tender
heart
yet
the
boy
remained
much
as
on
the
previous
evening
so
that
we
knew
not
what
to
do
with
him
to
bring
him
into
better
health
one
thing
we
tried
knowing
that
no
food
had
passed
his
lips
since
the
previous
morning
and
that
was
to
get
some
little
quantity
of
hot
water
rum
and
molasses
down
his
throat
for
it
seemed
to
us
he
might
die
from
very
lack
of
food
but
though
we
worked
with
him
for
more
than
the
half
of
an
hour
we
could
not
get
him
to
sufficiently
to
take
anything
and
without
that
we
had
fear
of
suffocating
him
and
so
presently
we
had
perforce
to
leave
him
within
the
tent
and
go
about
our
business
for
there
was
very
much
to
be
done
yet
before
we
did
aught
else
the
led
us
all
into
the
valley
being
determined
to
make
a
very
thorough
exploration
of
it
perchance
there
might
be
any
lurking
beast
or
waiting
to
rush
out
and
destroy
us
as
we
worked
and
more
he
would
make
search
that
he
might
discover
what
manner
of
creatures
had
disturbed
our
night
now
in
the
early
morning
when
we
had
gone
for
the
fuel
we
had
kept
to
the
upper
skirt
of
the
valley
where
the
rock
of
the
nearer
hill
came
down
into
the
spongy
ground
but
now
we
struck
right
down
into
the
middle
part
of
the
vale
making
a
way
amid
the
mighty
fungi
to
the
opening
that
filled
the
bottom
of
the
valley
now
though
the
ground
was
very
soft
there
was
in
it
so
much
of
springiness
that
it
left
no
trace
of
our
steps
after
we
had
gone
on
a
little
way
none
that
is
save
that
in
odd
places
a
wet
patch
followed
upon
our
treading
then
when
we
got
ourselves
near
to
the
pit
the
ground
became
softer
so
that
our
feet
sank
into
it
and
left
very
real
impressions
and
here
we
found
tracks
most
curious
and
bewildering
for
amid
the
slush
that
edged
the
pit
which
i
would
mention
here
had
less
the
look
of
a
pit
now
that
i
had
come
near
to
it
were
multitudes
of
markings
which
i
can
liken
to
nothing
so
much
as
the
tracks
of
mighty
slugs
amid
the
mud
only
that
they
were
not
altogether
like
to
that
of
slugs
for
there
were
other
markings
such
as
might
have
been
made
by
bunches
of
eels
cast
down
and
picked
up
continually
at
least
this
is
what
they
suggested
to
me
and
i
do
but
put
it
down
as
such
apart
from
the
markings
which
i
have
mentioned
there
was
everywhere
a
deal
of
slime
and
this
we
traced
all
over
the
valley
among
the
great
toadstool
plants
but
beyond
that
which
i
have
already
remarked
we
found
nothing
nay
but
i
was
near
to
forgetting
we
found
a
quantity
of
this
thin
slime
upon
those
fungi
which
filled
the
end
of
the
little
valley
nearest
to
our
encampment
and
here
also
we
discovered
many
of
them
fresh
broken
or
uprooted
and
there
was
the
same
mark
of
the
beast
upon
them
all
and
now
i
remember
the
dull
thuds
that
i
had
heard
in
the
night
and
made
little
doubt
but
that
the
creatures
had
climbed
the
great
toadstools
so
that
they
might
spy
us
out
and
it
may
be
that
many
climbed
upon
one
so
that
their
weight
broke
the
fungi
or
uprooted
them
at
least
so
the
thought
came
to
me
and
so
we
made
an
end
of
our
search
and
after
that
the
set
each
one
of
us
to
work
but
first
he
had
us
all
back
to
the
beach
to
give
a
hand
to
turn
over
the
boat
so
that
he
might
get
to
the
damaged
part
now
having
the
bottom
of
the
boat
full
to
his
view
he
made
discovery
that
there
was
other
damage
beside
that
of
the
burst
plank
for
the
bottom
plank
of
all
had
come
away
from
the
keel
which
seemed
to
us
a
very
serious
matter
though
it
did
not
show
when
the
boat
was
upon
her
bilges
yet
the
assured
us
that
he
had
no
doubts
but
that
she
could
be
made
seaworthy
though
it
would
take
a
greater
while
than
hitherto
he
had
thought
needful
having
concluded
his
examination
of
the
boat
the
sent
one
of
the
men
to
bring
the
out
of
the
tent
for
he
needed
some
planking
for
the
repair
of
the
damage
yet
when
the
boards
had
been
brought
he
needed
still
something
which
they
could
not
supply
and
this
was
a
length
of
very
sound
wood
of
some
three
inches
in
breadth
each
way
which
he
intended
to
bolt
against
the
starboard
side
of
the
keel
after
he
had
gotten
the
planking
replaced
so
far
as
was
possible
he
had
hopes
that
by
means
of
this
device
he
would
be
able
to
nail
the
bottom
plank
to
this
and
then
caulk
it
with
oakum
so
making
the
boat
almost
so
sound
as
ever
now
hearing
him
express
his
need
for
such
a
piece
of
timber
we
were
all
adrift
to
know
from
whence
such
a
thing
could
be
gotten
until
there
came
suddenly
to
me
a
memory
of
the
mast
and
topmast
upon
the
other
side
of
the
island
and
at
once
i
made
mention
of
them
at
that
the
nodded
saying
that
we
might
get
the
timber
out
of
it
though
it
would
be
a
work
requiring
some
considerable
labor
in
that
we
had
only
a
and
a
small
hatchet
then
he
sent
us
across
to
be
getting
it
clear
of
the
weed
promising
to
follow
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
trying
to
get
the
two
displaced
planks
back
into
position
having
reached
the
spars
we
with
a
very
good
will
to
shift
away
the
weed
and
wrack
that
was
piled
over
them
and
very
much
entangled
with
the
rigging
presently
we
had
laid
them
bare
and
so
we
discovered
them
to
be
in
remarkably
sound
condition
the
especially
being
a
fine
piece
of
timber
all
the
lower
and
topmast
standing
rigging
was
still
attached
though
in
places
the
lower
rigging
was
stranded
so
far
as
up
the
shrouds
yet
there
remained
much
that
was
good
and
all
of
it
quite
free
from
rot
and
of
the
very
finest
quality
of
white
hemp
such
as
is
to
be
seen
only
in
the
best
found
vessels
about
the
time
that
we
had
finished
clearing
the
weed
the
came
over
to
us
bringing
with
him
the
saw
and
the
hatchet
under
his
directions
we
cut
the
lanyards
of
the
topmast
rigging
and
after
that
sawed
through
the
topmast
just
above
the
cap
now
this
was
a
very
tough
piece
of
work
and
employed
us
a
great
part
of
the
morning
even
though
we
took
turn
and
turn
at
the
saw
and
when
it
was
done
we
were
mightily
glad
that
the
bade
one
of
the
men
go
over
with
some
weed
and
make
up
the
fire
for
dinner
after
which
he
was
to
put
on
a
piece
of
the
salt
meat
to
boil
in
the
meanwhile
the
had
started
to
cut
through
the
topmast
about
fifteen
feet
beyond
the
first
cut
for
that
was
the
length
of
the
batten
he
required
yet
so
wearisome
was
the
work
that
we
had
not
gotten
more
than
half
through
with
it
before
the
man
whom
the
had
sent
returned
to
say
that
the
dinner
was
ready
when
this
was
dispatched
and
we
had
rested
a
little
over
our
pipes
the
rose
and
led
us
back
for
he
was
determined
to
get
through
with
the
topmast
before
dark
presently
relieving
each
other
frequently
we
completed
the
second
cut
and
after
that
the
set
us
to
saw
a
block
about
twelve
inches
deep
from
the
remaining
portion
of
the
topmast
from
this
when
we
had
cut
it
he
proceeded
to
hew
wedges
with
the
hatchet
then
he
notched
the
end
of
the
log
and
into
the
notch
he
drove
the
wedges
and
so
towards
evening
as
much
maybe
by
good
luck
as
good
management
he
had
divided
the
log
into
two
halves
the
split
running
very
fairly
down
the
center
now
perceiving
how
that
it
drew
near
to
sundown
he
bade
the
men
haste
and
gather
weed
and
carry
it
across
to
our
camp
but
one
he
sent
along
the
shore
to
make
a
search
for
among
the
weed
yet
he
himself
ceased
not
to
work
at
the
divided
log
and
kept
me
with
him
as
helper
thus
within
the
next
hour
we
had
a
length
maybe
some
four
inches
in
diameter
split
off
the
whole
length
of
one
of
the
halves
and
with
this
he
was
very
well
content
though
it
seemed
but
a
very
little
result
for
so
much
labor
by
this
time
the
dusk
was
upon
us
and
the
men
having
made
an
end
of
weed
carrying
were
returned
to
us
and
stood
about
waiting
for
the
to
go
into
camp
at
this
moment
the
man
the
had
sent
to
gather
shellfish
returned
and
he
had
a
great
crab
upon
his
spear
which
he
had
spitted
through
the
belly
this
creature
could
not
have
been
less
than
a
foot
across
the
back
and
had
a
very
formidable
appearance
yet
it
proved
to
be
a
most
tasty
matter
for
our
supper
when
it
had
been
placed
for
a
while
in
boiling
water
now
so
soon
as
this
man
was
returned
we
made
at
once
for
the
camp
carrying
with
us
the
piece
of
timber
which
we
had
hewn
from
the
topmast
by
this
time
it
was
quite
dusk
and
very
strange
amid
the
great
fungi
as
we
struck
across
the
upper
edge
of
the
valley
to
the
opposite
beach
particularly
i
noticed
that
the
hateful
mouldy
odor
of
these
monstrous
vegetables
was
more
offensive
than
i
had
found
it
to
be
in
the
daytime
though
this
may
be
because
i
used
my
nose
the
more
in
that
i
could
not
use
my
eyes
to
any
great
extent
we
had
gotten
halfway
across
the
top
of
the
valley
and
the
gloom
was
deepening
steadily
when
there
stole
to
me
upon
the
calmness
of
the
evening
air
a
faint
smell
something
quite
different
from
that
of
the
surrounding
fungi
a
moment
later
i
got
a
great
whiff
of
it
and
was
near
sickened
with
the
abomination
of
it
but
the
memory
of
that
foul
thing
which
had
come
to
the
side
of
the
boat
in
the
before
we
discovered
the
island
roused
me
to
a
terror
beyond
that
of
the
sickness
of
my
stomach
for
suddenly
i
knew
what
manner
of
thing
it
was
that
had
beslimed
my
face
and
throat
upon
the
previous
night
and
left
its
hideous
stench
lingering
in
my
nostrils
and
with
the
knowledge
i
cried
out
to
the
to
make
haste
for
there
were
demons
with
us
in
the
valley
and
at
that
some
of
the
men
made
to
run
but
he
bade
them
in
a
very
grim
voice
stay
where
they
were
and
keep
well
together
else
would
they
be
attacked
and
overcome
straggled
all
among
the
fungi
in
the
dark
and
this
being
i
doubt
not
as
much
in
fear
of
the
rounding
dark
as
of
the
they
did
and
so
we
came
safely
out
of
the
valley
though
there
seemed
to
follow
us
a
little
lower
down
the
slope
an
uncanny
slithering
now
so
soon
as
we
reached
the
camp
the
ordered
four
fires
to
be
lit
one
on
each
side
of
the
tent
and
this
we
did
lighting
them
at
the
embers
of
our
old
fire
which
we
had
most
foolishly
allowed
to
die
down
when
the
fires
had
been
got
going
we
put
on
the
boiler
and
treated
the
great
crab
as
i
have
already
mentioned
and
so
upon
a
very
hearty
supper
but
as
we
ate
each
man
had
his
weapon
stuck
in
the
sand
beside
him
for
we
had
knowledge
that
the
valley
held
some
devilish
thing
or
maybe
many
though
the
knowing
did
not
spoil
our
appetites
and
so
presently
we
came
to
an
end
of
eating
whereat
each
man
pulled
out
his
pipe
intending
to
smoke
but
the
told
one
of
the
men
to
get
him
upon
his
feet
and
keep
watch
else
might
we
be
in
danger
of
surprise
with
every
man
lolling
upon
the
sand
and
this
seemed
to
me
very
good
sense
for
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
men
too
readily
deemed
themselves
secure
by
reason
of
the
brightness
of
the
fires
about
them
now
whilst
the
men
were
taking
their
ease
within
the
circle
of
the
fires
the
lit
one
of
the
dips
which
we
had
out
of
the
ship
in
the
creek
and
went
in
to
see
how
job
was
after
the
day
rest
at
that
i
rose
up
reproaching
myself
for
having
forgotten
the
poor
lad
and
followed
the
into
the
tent
yet
i
had
but
reached
the
opening
when
he
gave
out
a
loud
cry
and
held
the
candle
low
down
to
the
sand
at
that
i
saw
the
reason
for
his
agitation
for
in
the
place
where
we
had
left
job
there
was
nothing
i
stepped
into
the
tent
and
in
the
same
instant
there
came
to
my
nostrils
the
faint
odor
of
the
horrible
stench
which
had
come
to
me
in
the
valley
and
before
then
from
the
thing
that
came
to
the
side
of
the
boat
and
suddenly
i
knew
that
job
had
fallen
prey
of
those
foul
things
and
knowing
this
i
called
out
to
the
that
had
taken
the
boy
and
then
my
eyes
caught
the
smear
of
slime
upon
the
sand
and
i
had
proof
that
i
was
not
mistaken
now
so
soon
as
the
knew
all
that
was
in
my
mind
though
indeed
it
did
but
corroborate
that
which
had
come
to
his
own
he
came
swiftly
out
from
the
tent
bidding
the
men
to
stand
back
for
they
had
come
all
about
the
entrance
being
very
much
discomposed
at
that
which
the
had
discovered
then
the
took
from
a
bundle
of
the
reeds
which
they
had
cut
at
the
time
when
he
had
bidden
them
gather
fuel
several
of
the
thickest
and
to
one
of
these
he
bound
a
great
mass
of
the
dry
weed
whereupon
the
men
divining
his
intention
did
likewise
with
the
others
and
so
we
had
each
of
us
the
wherewithal
for
a
mighty
torch
so
soon
as
we
had
completed
our
preparations
we
took
each
man
his
weapon
and
plunging
our
torches
into
the
fires
set
off
along
the
track
which
had
been
made
by
the
and
the
body
of
poor
job
for
now
that
we
had
suspicion
that
harm
had
come
to
him
the
marks
in
the
sand
and
the
slime
were
very
plain
to
be
seen
so
that
it
was
a
wonder
that
we
had
not
discovered
them
earlier
now
the
led
the
way
and
finding
the
marks
led
direct
to
the
valley
he
broke
into
a
run
holding
his
torch
well
above
his
head
at
that
each
of
us
did
likewise
for
we
had
a
great
desire
to
be
together
and
further
than
this
i
think
with
truth
i
may
say
we
were
all
fierce
to
avenge
job
so
that
we
had
less
of
fear
in
our
hearts
than
otherwise
had
been
the
case
in
less
than
the
half
of
a
minute
we
had
reached
the
end
of
the
valley
but
here
the
ground
being
of
a
nature
not
happy
in
the
revealing
of
tracks
we
were
at
fault
to
know
in
which
direction
to
continue
at
that
the
set
up
a
loud
shout
to
job
perchance
he
might
be
yet
alive
but
there
came
no
answer
to
us
save
a
low
and
uncomfortable
echo
then
the
desiring
to
waste
no
more
time
ran
straight
down
towards
the
center
of
the
valley
and
we
followed
and
kept
our
eyes
very
open
about
us
we
had
gotten
perhaps
halfway
when
one
of
the
men
shouted
that
he
saw
something
ahead
but
the
had
seen
it
earlier
for
he
was
running
straight
down
upon
it
holding
his
torch
high
and
swinging
his
great
cutlass
then
instead
of
smiting
he
fell
upon
his
knees
beside
it
and
the
following
instant
we
were
up
with
him
and
in
that
same
moment
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
saw
a
number
of
white
shapes
melt
swiftly
into
the
shadows
further
ahead
but
i
had
no
thought
for
these
when
i
perceived
that
by
which
the
knelt
for
it
was
the
stark
body
of
job
and
no
inch
of
it
but
was
covered
with
the
little
ringed
marks
that
i
had
discovered
upon
my
throat
and
from
every
place
there
ran
a
trickle
of
blood
so
that
he
was
a
most
horrid
and
fearsome
sight
at
the
sight
of
job
so
mangled
and
there
came
over
us
the
sudden
quiet
of
a
mortal
terror
and
in
that
space
of
silence
the
placed
his
hand
over
the
poor
lad
heart
but
there
was
no
movement
though
the
body
was
still
warm
immediately
upon
that
he
rose
to
his
feet
a
look
of
vast
wrath
upon
his
great
face
he
plucked
his
torch
from
the
ground
into
which
he
had
plunged
the
haft
and
stared
round
into
the
silence
of
the
valley
but
there
was
no
living
thing
in
sight
nothing
save
the
giant
fungi
and
the
strange
shadows
cast
by
our
great
torches
and
the
loneliness
at
this
moment
one
of
the
men
torches
having
burnt
near
out
fell
all
to
pieces
so
that
he
held
nothing
but
the
charred
support
and
immediately
two
more
came
to
a
like
end
upon
this
we
became
afraid
that
they
would
not
last
us
back
to
the
camp
and
we
looked
to
the
to
know
his
wish
but
the
man
was
very
silent
and
peering
everywhere
into
the
shadows
then
a
fourth
torch
fell
to
the
ground
in
a
shower
of
embers
and
i
turned
to
look
in
the
same
instant
there
came
a
great
flare
of
light
behind
me
accompanied
by
the
dull
thud
of
a
dry
matter
set
suddenly
alight
i
glanced
swiftly
back
to
the
and
he
was
staring
up
at
one
of
the
giant
toadstools
which
was
in
flames
all
along
its
nearer
edge
and
burning
with
an
incredible
fury
sending
out
spirits
of
flame
and
anon
giving
out
sharp
reports
and
at
each
report
a
fine
powder
was
belched
in
thin
streams
which
getting
into
our
throats
and
nostrils
set
us
sneezing
and
coughing
most
lamentably
so
that
i
am
convinced
had
any
enemy
come
upon
us
at
that
moment
we
had
been
undone
by
reason
of
our
uncouth
helplessness
now
whether
it
had
come
to
the
to
set
alight
this
first
of
the
fungi
i
know
not
for
it
may
be
that
his
torch
coming
by
chance
against
it
set
it
afire
however
it
chanced
the
took
it
as
a
veritable
hint
from
providence
and
was
already
setting
his
torch
to
one
a
little
further
off
whilst
the
rest
of
us
were
near
to
choking
with
our
coughings
and
sneezings
yet
that
we
were
so
suddenly
overcome
by
the
potency
of
the
powder
i
doubt
if
a
full
minute
passed
before
we
were
each
one
busied
after
the
manner
of
the
and
those
whose
torches
had
burned
out
knocked
flaming
pieces
from
the
burning
fungus
and
with
these
impaled
upon
their
did
so
much
execution
as
any
and
thus
it
happened
that
within
five
minutes
of
this
discovery
of
body
the
whole
of
that
hideous
valley
sent
up
to
heaven
the
reek
of
its
burning
whilst
we
filled
with
murderous
desires
ran
hither
and
thither
with
our
weapons
seeking
to
destroy
the
vile
creatures
that
had
brought
the
poor
lad
to
so
unholy
a
death
yet
nowhere
could
we
discover
any
brute
or
creature
upon
which
to
ease
our
vengeance
and
so
presently
the
valley
becoming
impassable
by
reason
of
the
heat
the
flying
sparks
and
the
abundance
of
the
acrid
dust
we
made
back
to
the
body
of
the
boy
and
bore
him
thence
to
the
shore
and
during
all
that
night
no
man
of
us
slept
and
the
burning
of
the
fungi
sent
up
a
mighty
pillar
of
flame
out
of
the
valley
as
out
of
the
mouth
of
a
monstrous
pit
and
when
the
morning
came
it
still
burned
then
when
it
was
daylight
some
of
us
slept
being
greatly
awearied
but
some
kept
watch
and
when
we
waked
there
was
a
great
wind
and
rain
upon
the
island
x
the
light
in
the
weed
now
the
wind
was
very
violent
from
the
sea
and
threatened
to
blow
down
our
tent
the
which
indeed
it
achieved
at
last
as
we
made
an
end
of
a
cheerless
breakfast
yet
the
bade
us
not
trouble
to
put
it
up
again
but
spread
it
out
with
the
edges
raised
upon
props
made
from
the
reeds
so
that
we
might
catch
some
of
the
rainwater
for
it
was
become
imperative
that
we
should
renew
our
supply
before
putting
out
again
to
sea
and
whilst
some
of
us
were
busied
about
this
he
took
the
others
and
set
up
a
small
tent
made
of
the
spare
canvas
and
under
this
he
sheltered
all
of
our
matters
like
to
be
harmed
by
the
rain
in
a
little
the
rain
continuing
very
violent
we
had
near
a
of
water
collected
in
the
canvas
and
were
about
to
run
it
off
into
one
of
the
breakers
when
the
cried
out
to
us
to
hold
and
first
taste
the
water
before
we
mixed
it
with
that
which
we
had
already
at
that
we
put
down
our
hands
and
scooped
up
some
of
the
water
to
taste
and
thus
we
discovered
it
to
be
brackish
and
quite
undrinkable
at
which
i
was
amazed
until
the
reminded
us
that
the
canvas
had
been
saturated
for
many
days
with
salt
water
so
that
it
would
take
a
great
quantity
of
fresh
before
all
the
salt
was
washed
out
then
he
told
us
to
lay
it
flat
upon
the
beach
and
scour
it
well
on
both
sides
with
the
sand
which
we
did
and
afterwards
let
the
rain
rinse
it
well
whereupon
the
next
water
that
we
caught
we
found
to
be
near
fresh
though
not
sufficiently
so
for
our
purpose
yet
when
we
had
rinsed
it
once
more
it
became
clear
of
the
salt
so
that
we
were
able
to
keep
all
that
we
caught
further
and
then
something
before
noon
the
rain
ceased
to
fall
though
coming
again
at
odd
times
in
short
squalls
yet
the
wind
died
not
but
blew
steadily
and
continued
so
from
that
quarter
during
the
remainder
of
the
time
that
we
were
upon
the
island
upon
the
ceasing
of
the
rain
the
called
us
all
together
that
we
might
make
a
decent
burial
of
the
unfortunate
lad
whose
remains
had
lain
during
the
night
upon
one
of
the
of
the
boat
after
a
little
discussion
it
was
decided
to
bury
him
in
the
beach
for
the
only
part
where
there
was
soft
earth
was
in
the
valley
and
none
of
us
had
a
stomach
for
that
place
moreover
the
sand
was
soft
and
easy
to
dig
and
as
we
had
no
proper
tools
this
was
a
great
consideration
presently
using
the
and
the
oars
and
the
hatchet
we
had
a
place
large
and
deep
enough
to
hold
the
boy
and
into
this
we
placed
him
we
made
no
prayer
over
him
but
stood
about
the
grave
for
a
little
space
in
silence
then
the
signed
to
us
to
fill
in
the
sand
and
therewith
we
covered
up
the
poor
lad
and
left
him
to
his
sleep
and
presently
we
made
our
dinner
after
which
the
served
out
to
each
one
of
us
a
very
sound
tot
of
the
rum
for
he
was
minded
to
bring
us
back
again
to
a
cheerful
state
of
mind
after
we
had
sat
awhile
smoking
the
divided
us
into
two
parties
to
make
a
search
through
the
island
among
the
rocks
perchance
we
should
find
water
collected
from
the
rain
among
the
hollows
and
crevasses
for
though
we
had
gotten
some
through
our
device
with
the
sail
yet
we
had
by
no
means
caught
sufficient
for
our
needs
he
was
especially
anxious
for
haste
in
that
the
sun
had
come
out
again
for
he
was
feared
that
such
small
pools
as
we
should
find
would
be
speedily
dried
up
by
its
heat
now
the
headed
one
party
and
set
the
big
seaman
over
the
other
bidding
all
to
keep
their
weapons
very
handy
then
he
set
out
to
the
rocks
about
the
base
of
the
nearer
hill
sending
the
others
to
the
farther
and
greater
one
and
in
each
party
we
carried
an
empty
breaker
slung
from
a
couple
of
the
stout
reeds
so
that
we
might
put
all
such
driblets
as
we
should
find
straight
away
into
it
before
they
had
time
to
vanish
into
the
hot
air
and
for
the
purpose
of
bailing
up
the
water
we
had
brought
with
us
our
tin
pannikins
and
one
of
the
boat
bailers
in
a
while
and
after
much
scrambling
amid
the
rocks
we
came
upon
a
little
pool
of
water
that
was
remarkably
sweet
and
fresh
and
from
this
we
removed
near
three
gallons
before
it
became
dry
and
after
that
we
came
across
maybe
five
or
six
others
but
not
one
of
them
near
so
big
as
the
first
yet
we
were
not
displeased
for
we
had
near
three
parts
filled
the
breaker
and
so
we
made
back
to
the
camp
having
some
wonder
as
to
the
luck
of
the
other
party
when
we
came
near
the
camp
we
found
the
others
returned
before
us
and
seeming
in
a
very
high
content
with
themselves
so
that
we
had
no
need
to
call
to
them
as
to
whether
they
had
filled
their
breaker
when
they
saw
us
they
set
out
to
us
at
a
run
to
tell
us
that
they
had
come
upon
a
great
basin
of
fresh
water
in
a
deep
hollow
a
third
of
the
distance
up
the
side
of
the
far
hill
and
at
this
the
bade
us
put
down
our
breaker
and
make
all
of
us
to
the
hill
so
that
he
might
examine
for
himself
whether
their
news
was
so
good
as
it
seemed
presently
being
guided
by
the
other
party
we
passed
around
to
the
back
of
the
far
hill
and
discovered
it
to
go
upward
to
the
top
at
an
easy
slope
with
many
ledges
and
broken
places
so
that
it
was
scarce
more
difficult
than
a
stair
to
climb
and
so
having
climbed
perhaps
ninety
or
a
hundred
feet
we
came
suddenly
upon
the
place
which
held
the
water
and
found
that
they
had
not
made
too
much
of
their
discovery
for
the
pool
was
near
twenty
feet
long
by
twelve
broad
and
so
clear
as
though
it
had
come
from
a
fountain
yet
it
had
considerable
depth
as
we
discovered
by
thrusting
a
spear
shaft
down
into
it
now
the
having
seen
for
himself
how
good
a
supply
of
water
there
was
for
our
needs
seemed
very
much
relieved
in
his
mind
and
declared
that
within
three
days
at
the
most
we
might
leave
the
island
at
which
we
felt
none
of
us
any
regret
indeed
had
the
boat
escaped
harm
we
had
been
able
to
leave
that
same
day
but
this
could
not
be
for
there
was
much
to
be
done
before
we
had
her
seaworthy
again
having
waited
until
the
had
made
complete
his
examination
we
turned
to
descend
thinking
that
this
would
be
the
intention
but
he
called
to
us
to
stay
and
looking
back
we
saw
that
he
made
to
finish
the
ascent
of
the
hill
at
that
we
hastened
to
follow
him
though
we
had
no
notion
of
his
reason
for
going
higher
presently
we
were
come
to
the
top
and
here
we
found
a
very
spacious
place
nicely
level
save
that
in
one
or
two
parts
it
was
crossed
by
deepish
cracks
maybe
half
a
foot
to
a
foot
wide
and
perhaps
three
to
six
fathoms
long
but
apart
from
these
and
some
great
boulders
it
was
as
i
have
mentioned
a
spacious
place
moreover
it
was
bone
dry
and
pleasantly
firm
under
feet
after
so
long
upon
the
sand
i
think
even
thus
early
i
had
some
notion
of
the
design
for
i
went
to
the
edge
that
overlooked
the
valley
and
peered
down
and
finding
it
nigh
a
sheer
precipice
found
myself
nodding
my
head
as
though
it
were
in
accordance
with
some
part
formed
wish
presently
looking
about
me
i
discovered
the
to
be
surveying
that
part
which
looked
over
towards
the
weed
and
i
made
across
to
join
him
here
again
i
saw
that
the
hill
fell
away
very
sheer
and
after
that
we
went
across
to
the
seaward
edge
and
there
it
was
near
as
abrupt
as
on
the
weed
side
then
having
by
this
time
thought
a
little
upon
the
matter
i
put
it
straight
to
the
that
here
would
make
indeed
a
very
secure
camping
place
with
nothing
to
come
at
us
upon
our
sides
or
back
and
our
front
where
was
the
slope
could
be
watched
with
ease
and
this
i
put
to
him
with
great
warmth
for
i
was
mortally
in
dread
of
the
coming
night
now
when
i
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
the
disclosed
to
me
that
this
was
as
i
had
suspicion
his
intent
and
immediately
he
called
to
the
men
that
we
should
haste
down
and
ship
our
camp
to
the
top
of
the
hill
at
that
the
men
expressed
their
approbation
and
we
made
haste
every
one
of
us
to
the
camp
and
began
straightway
to
move
our
gear
to
the
hilltop
in
the
meanwhile
the
taking
me
to
assist
him
again
upon
the
boat
being
intent
to
get
his
batten
nicely
shaped
and
fit
to
the
side
of
the
keel
so
that
it
would
bed
well
to
the
keel
but
more
particularly
to
the
plank
which
had
sprung
outward
from
its
place
and
at
this
he
labored
the
greater
part
of
that
afternoon
using
the
little
hatchet
to
shape
the
wood
which
he
did
with
surprising
skill
yet
when
the
evening
was
come
he
had
not
brought
it
to
his
liking
but
it
must
not
be
thought
that
he
did
naught
but
work
at
the
boat
for
he
had
the
men
to
direct
and
once
he
had
to
make
his
way
to
the
top
of
the
hill
to
fix
the
place
for
the
tent
and
after
the
tent
was
up
he
set
them
to
carry
the
dry
weed
to
the
new
camp
and
at
this
he
kept
them
until
near
dusk
for
he
had
vowed
never
again
to
be
without
a
sufficiency
of
fuel
but
two
of
the
men
he
sent
to
collect
putting
two
of
them
to
the
task
because
he
would
not
have
one
alone
upon
the
island
not
knowing
but
that
there
might
be
danger
even
though
it
were
bright
day
and
a
most
happy
ruling
it
proved
for
a
little
past
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
we
heard
them
shouting
at
the
other
end
of
the
valley
and
not
knowing
but
that
they
were
in
need
of
assistance
we
ran
with
all
haste
to
discover
the
reason
of
their
calling
passing
along
the
side
of
the
blackened
and
sodden
vale
upon
reaching
the
further
beach
we
saw
a
most
incredible
sight
for
the
two
men
were
running
towards
us
through
the
thick
masses
of
the
weed
while
no
more
than
four
or
five
fathoms
behind
they
were
pursued
by
an
enormous
crab
now
i
had
thought
the
crab
we
had
tried
to
capture
before
coming
to
the
island
a
prodigy
unsurpassed
but
this
creature
was
more
than
treble
its
size
seeming
as
though
a
prodigious
table
were
of
them
and
moreover
spite
of
its
monstrous
bulk
it
made
better
way
over
the
weed
than
i
should
have
conceived
to
be
possible
running
almost
sideways
and
with
one
enormous
claw
raised
near
a
dozen
feet
into
the
air
now
whether
omitting
accidents
the
men
would
have
made
good
their
escape
to
the
firmer
ground
of
the
valley
where
they
could
have
attained
to
a
greater
speed
i
do
not
know
but
suddenly
one
of
them
tripped
over
a
loop
of
the
weed
and
the
next
instant
lay
helpless
upon
his
face
he
had
been
dead
the
following
moment
but
for
the
pluck
of
his
companion
who
faced
round
manfully
upon
the
monster
and
ran
at
it
with
his
spear
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
spear
took
it
about
a
foot
below
the
overhanging
armor
of
the
great
back
shell
and
i
could
see
that
it
penetrated
some
distance
into
the
creature
the
man
having
by
the
aid
of
providence
stricken
it
in
a
vulnerable
part
upon
receiving
this
thrust
the
mighty
crab
ceased
at
once
its
pursuit
and
clipped
at
the
haft
of
the
spear
with
its
great
mandible
snapping
the
weapon
more
easily
than
i
had
done
the
same
thing
to
a
straw
by
the
time
we
had
raced
up
to
the
men
the
one
who
had
stumbled
was
again
upon
his
feet
and
turning
to
assist
his
comrade
but
the
snatched
his
spear
from
him
and
leapt
forward
himself
for
the
crab
was
making
now
at
the
other
man
now
the
did
not
attempt
to
thrust
the
spear
into
the
monster
but
instead
he
made
two
swift
blows
at
the
great
protruding
eyes
and
in
a
moment
the
creature
had
curled
itself
up
helpless
save
that
the
huge
claw
waved
about
aimlessly
at
that
the
drew
us
off
though
the
man
who
had
attacked
the
crab
desired
to
make
an
end
of
it
averring
that
we
should
get
some
very
good
eating
out
of
it
but
to
this
the
would
not
listen
telling
him
that
it
was
yet
capable
of
very
deadly
mischief
did
any
but
come
within
reach
of
its
prodigious
mandible
and
after
this
he
bade
them
look
no
more
for
shellfish
but
take
out
the
two
which
we
had
and
see
if
they
could
catch
aught
from
some
safe
ledge
on
the
further
side
of
the
hill
upon
which
we
had
made
our
camp
then
he
returned
to
his
mending
of
the
boat
it
was
a
little
before
the
evening
came
down
upon
the
island
that
the
ceased
work
and
after
that
he
called
to
the
men
who
having
made
an
end
of
their
fuel
carrying
were
standing
near
to
place
the
full
breakers
which
we
had
not
thought
needful
to
carry
to
the
new
camp
on
account
of
their
weight
under
the
upturned
boat
some
holding
up
the
gunnel
whilst
the
others
pushed
them
under
then
the
laid
the
unfinished
batten
along
with
them
and
we
lowered
the
boat
again
over
all
trusting
to
its
weight
to
prevent
any
creature
from
meddling
with
aught
after
that
we
made
at
once
to
the
camp
being
wearifully
tired
and
with
a
hearty
anticipation
of
supper
upon
reaching
the
hilltop
the
men
whom
the
had
sent
with
the
lines
came
to
show
him
a
very
fine
fish
something
like
to
a
huge
which
they
had
caught
a
few
minutes
earlier
this
the
after
examining
did
not
hesitate
to
pronounce
fit
for
food
whereupon
they
and
opened
and
cleaned
it
now
as
i
have
said
it
was
not
unlike
a
great
and
like
it
had
a
mouth
full
of
very
formidable
teeth
the
use
of
which
i
understood
the
better
when
i
saw
the
contents
of
its
stomach
which
seemed
to
consist
of
nothing
but
the
coiled
tentacles
of
squid
or
cuttlefish
with
which
as
i
have
shown
the
swarmed
when
these
were
upset
upon
the
rock
i
was
confounded
to
perceive
the
length
and
thickness
of
some
of
them
and
could
only
conceive
that
this
particular
fish
must
be
a
very
desperate
enemy
to
them
and
able
successfully
to
attack
monsters
of
a
bulk
infinitely
greater
than
its
own
after
this
and
whilst
the
supper
was
preparing
the
called
to
some
of
the
men
to
put
up
a
piece
of
the
spare
canvas
upon
a
couple
of
the
reeds
so
as
to
make
a
screen
against
the
wind
which
up
there
was
so
fresh
that
it
came
near
at
times
to
scattering
the
fire
abroad
this
they
found
not
difficult
for
a
little
on
the
windward
side
of
the
fire
there
ran
one
of
the
cracks
of
which
i
have
made
previous
mention
and
into
this
they
jammed
the
supports
and
so
in
a
very
little
time
had
the
fire
screened
presently
the
supper
was
ready
and
i
found
the
fish
to
be
very
fair
eating
though
somewhat
coarse
but
this
was
no
great
matter
for
concern
with
so
empty
a
stomach
as
i
contained
and
here
i
would
remark
that
we
made
our
fishing
save
our
provisions
through
all
our
stay
on
the
island
then
after
we
had
come
to
an
end
of
our
eating
we
lay
down
to
a
most
comfortable
smoke
for
we
had
no
fear
of
attack
at
that
height
and
with
precipices
upon
all
sides
save
that
which
lay
in
front
yet
so
soon
as
we
had
rested
and
smoked
a
while
the
set
the
watches
for
he
would
run
no
risk
through
carelessness
by
this
time
the
night
was
drawing
on
apace
yet
it
was
not
so
dark
but
that
one
could
perceive
matters
at
a
very
reasonable
distance
presently
being
in
a
mood
that
tended
to
thoughtfulness
and
feeling
a
desire
to
be
alone
for
a
little
i
strolled
away
from
the
fire
to
the
leeward
edge
of
the
hilltop
here
i
paced
up
and
down
awhile
smoking
and
meditating
anon
i
would
stare
out
across
the
immensity
of
the
vast
continent
of
weed
and
slime
that
stretched
its
incredible
desolation
out
beyond
the
darkening
horizon
and
there
would
come
the
thought
to
me
of
the
terror
of
men
whose
vessels
had
been
entangled
among
its
strange
growths
and
so
my
thoughts
came
to
the
lone
derelict
that
lay
out
there
in
the
dusk
and
i
fell
to
wondering
what
had
been
the
end
of
her
people
and
at
that
i
grew
yet
more
solemn
in
my
heart
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
must
have
died
at
last
by
starvation
and
if
not
by
that
then
by
the
act
of
some
one
of
the
which
inhabited
that
lonely
and
then
even
as
i
fell
upon
this
thought
the
clapped
me
upon
the
shoulder
and
told
me
in
a
very
hearty
way
to
come
to
the
light
of
the
fire
and
banish
all
melancholy
thoughts
for
he
had
a
very
penetrating
discernment
and
had
followed
me
quietly
from
the
camping
place
having
had
reason
once
or
twice
before
to
chide
me
for
gloomy
meditations
and
for
this
and
many
other
matters
i
had
grown
to
like
the
man
the
which
i
could
almost
believe
at
times
was
his
regarding
of
me
but
his
words
were
too
few
for
me
to
gather
his
feelings
though
i
had
hope
that
they
were
as
i
surmised
and
so
i
came
back
to
the
fire
and
presently
it
not
being
my
time
to
watch
until
after
midnight
i
turned
into
the
tent
for
a
spell
of
sleep
having
first
arranged
a
comfortable
spread
of
some
of
the
softer
portions
of
the
dry
weed
to
make
me
a
bed
now
i
was
very
full
of
sleep
so
that
i
slept
heavily
and
in
this
wise
heard
not
the
man
on
watch
call
the
yet
the
rousing
of
the
others
waked
me
and
so
i
came
to
myself
and
found
the
tent
empty
at
which
i
ran
very
hurriedly
to
the
doorway
and
so
discovered
that
there
was
a
clear
moon
in
the
sky
the
which
by
reason
of
the
cloudiness
that
had
prevailed
we
had
been
without
for
the
past
two
nights
moreover
the
sultriness
had
gone
the
wind
having
blown
it
away
with
the
clouds
yet
though
maybe
i
appreciated
this
it
was
but
in
a
manner
for
i
was
put
about
to
discover
the
whereabouts
of
the
men
and
the
reason
of
their
leaving
the
tent
with
this
purpose
i
stepped
out
from
the
entrance
and
the
following
instant
discovered
them
all
in
a
clump
beside
the
leeward
edge
of
the
hilltop
at
that
i
held
my
tongue
for
i
knew
not
but
that
silence
might
be
their
desire
but
i
ran
hastily
over
to
them
and
inquired
of
the
what
manner
of
thing
it
was
which
called
them
from
their
sleep
and
he
for
answer
pointed
out
into
the
greatness
of
the
at
that
i
stared
out
over
the
breadth
of
the
weed
showing
very
ghostly
in
the
moonlight
but
for
the
moment
i
saw
not
the
thing
to
which
he
purposed
to
draw
my
attention
then
suddenly
it
fell
within
the
circle
of
my
gaze
a
little
light
out
in
the
lonesomeness
for
the
space
of
some
moments
i
stared
with
bewildered
eyes
then
it
came
to
me
with
abruptness
that
the
light
shone
from
the
lone
derelict
lying
out
in
the
weed
the
same
that
upon
that
very
evening
i
had
looked
with
sorrow
and
awe
because
of
the
end
of
those
who
had
been
in
her
and
now
behold
a
light
burning
seemingly
within
one
of
her
after
cabins
though
the
moon
was
scarce
powerful
enough
to
enable
the
outline
of
the
hulk
to
be
seen
clear
of
the
rounding
wilderness
and
from
this
time
until
the
day
we
had
no
more
sleep
but
made
up
the
fire
and
sat
round
it
full
of
excitement
and
wonder
and
getting
up
continually
to
discover
if
the
light
still
burned
this
it
ceased
to
do
about
an
hour
after
i
had
first
seen
it
but
it
was
the
more
proof
that
some
of
our
kind
were
no
more
than
the
half
of
a
mile
from
our
camp
and
at
last
the
day
came
xi
the
signals
from
the
ship
now
so
soon
as
it
was
clearly
light
we
went
all
of
us
to
the
leeward
brow
of
the
hill
to
stare
upon
the
derelict
which
now
we
had
cause
to
believe
no
derelict
but
an
inhabited
vessel
yet
though
we
watched
her
for
upwards
of
two
hours
we
could
discover
no
sign
of
any
living
creature
the
which
indeed
had
we
been
in
cooler
minds
we
had
not
thought
strange
seeing
that
she
was
all
so
shut
in
by
the
great
superstructure
but
we
were
hot
to
see
a
fellow
creature
after
so
much
lonesomeness
and
terror
in
strange
lands
and
seas
and
so
could
not
by
any
means
contain
ourselves
in
patience
until
those
aboard
the
hulk
should
choose
to
discover
themselves
to
us
and
so
at
last
being
wearied
with
watching
we
made
it
up
together
to
shout
when
the
should
give
us
the
signal
by
this
means
making
a
good
volume
of
sound
which
we
conceived
the
wind
might
carry
down
to
the
vessel
yet
though
we
raised
many
shouts
making
as
it
seemed
to
us
a
very
great
noise
there
came
no
response
from
the
ship
and
at
last
we
were
fain
to
cease
from
our
calling
and
ponder
some
other
way
of
bringing
ourselves
to
the
notice
of
those
within
the
hulk
for
a
while
we
talked
some
proposing
one
thing
and
some
another
but
none
of
them
seeming
like
to
achieve
our
purpose
and
after
that
we
fell
to
marveling
that
the
fire
which
we
had
lit
in
the
valley
had
not
awakened
them
to
the
fact
that
some
of
their
fellow
creatures
were
upon
the
island
for
had
it
we
could
not
suppose
but
that
they
would
have
kept
a
perpetual
watch
upon
the
island
until
such
time
as
they
should
have
been
able
to
attract
our
notice
nay
more
than
this
it
was
scarce
credible
that
they
should
not
have
made
an
answering
fire
or
set
some
of
their
bunting
above
the
superstructure
so
that
our
gaze
should
be
arrested
upon
the
instant
we
chanced
to
glance
towards
the
hulk
but
so
far
from
this
there
appeared
even
a
purpose
to
shun
our
attention
for
that
light
which
we
had
viewed
in
the
past
night
was
more
in
the
way
of
an
accident
than
of
the
nature
of
a
purposeful
exhibition
and
so
presently
we
went
to
breakfast
eating
heartily
our
night
of
wakefulness
having
given
us
mighty
appetites
but
for
all
that
we
were
so
engrossed
by
the
mystery
of
the
lonesome
craft
that
i
doubt
if
any
of
us
knew
what
manner
of
food
it
was
with
which
we
filled
our
bellies
for
first
one
view
of
the
matter
would
be
raised
and
when
this
had
been
combated
another
would
be
broached
and
in
this
wise
it
came
up
finally
that
some
of
the
men
were
falling
in
doubt
whether
the
ship
was
inhabited
by
anything
human
saying
rather
that
it
might
be
held
by
some
demoniac
creature
of
the
great
at
this
proposition
there
came
among
us
a
very
uncomfortable
silence
for
not
only
did
it
chill
the
warmth
of
our
hopes
but
seemed
like
to
provide
us
with
a
fresh
terror
who
were
already
acquainted
with
too
much
then
the
spoke
laughing
with
a
hearty
contempt
at
our
sudden
fears
and
pointed
out
that
it
was
just
as
like
that
they
aboard
the
ship
had
been
put
in
fear
by
the
great
blaze
from
the
valley
as
that
they
should
take
it
for
a
sign
that
fellow
creatures
and
friends
were
at
hand
for
as
he
put
it
to
us
who
of
us
could
say
what
fell
brutes
and
demons
the
did
hold
and
if
we
had
reason
to
know
that
there
were
very
dread
things
among
the
weed
how
much
the
more
must
they
who
had
for
all
that
we
knew
been
many
years
beset
around
by
such
and
so
as
he
went
on
to
make
clear
we
might
suppose
that
they
were
very
well
aware
there
had
come
some
creatures
to
the
island
yet
maybe
they
desired
not
to
make
themselves
known
until
they
had
been
given
sight
of
them
and
because
of
this
we
must
wait
until
they
chose
to
discover
themselves
to
us
now
when
the
had
made
an
end
we
felt
each
one
of
us
greatly
cheered
for
his
discourse
seemed
very
reasonable
yet
still
there
were
many
matters
that
troubled
our
company
for
as
one
put
it
was
it
not
mightily
strange
that
we
had
not
had
previous
sight
of
their
light
or
in
the
day
of
the
smoke
from
their
galley
fire
but
to
this
the
replied
that
our
camp
hitherto
had
lain
in
a
place
where
we
had
not
sight
even
of
the
great
world
of
weed
leaving
alone
any
view
of
the
derelict
and
more
that
at
such
times
as
we
had
crossed
to
the
opposite
beach
we
had
been
occupied
too
sincerely
to
have
much
thought
to
watch
the
hulk
which
indeed
from
that
position
showed
only
her
great
superstructure
further
that
until
the
preceding
day
we
had
but
once
climbed
to
any
height
and
that
from
our
present
camp
the
derelict
could
not
be
viewed
and
to
do
so
we
had
to
go
near
to
the
leeward
edge
of
the
and
so
breakfast
being
ended
we
went
all
of
us
to
see
if
there
were
yet
any
signs
of
life
in
the
hulk
but
when
an
hour
had
gone
we
were
no
wiser
therefore
it
being
folly
to
waste
further
time
the
left
one
man
to
watch
from
the
brow
of
the
hill
charging
him
very
strictly
to
keep
in
such
position
that
he
could
be
seen
by
any
aboard
the
silent
craft
and
so
took
the
rest
down
to
assist
him
in
the
repairing
of
the
boat
and
from
thence
on
during
the
day
he
gave
the
men
a
turn
each
at
watching
telling
them
to
wave
to
him
should
there
come
any
sign
from
the
hulk
yet
excepting
the
watch
he
kept
every
man
so
busy
as
might
be
some
bringing
weed
to
keep
up
a
fire
which
he
had
lit
near
the
boat
one
to
help
him
turn
and
hold
the
batten
upon
which
he
labored
and
two
he
sent
across
to
the
wreck
of
the
mast
to
detach
one
of
the
futtock
shrouds
which
as
is
most
rare
were
made
of
iron
rods
this
when
they
brought
it
he
bade
me
heat
in
the
fire
and
afterwards
beat
out
straight
at
one
end
and
when
this
was
done
he
set
me
to
burn
holes
with
it
through
the
keel
of
the
boat
at
such
places
as
he
had
marked
these
being
for
the
bolts
with
which
he
had
determined
to
fasten
on
the
batten
in
the
meanwhile
he
continued
to
shape
the
batten
until
it
was
a
very
good
and
true
fit
according
to
his
liking
and
all
the
while
he
cried
out
to
this
man
and
to
that
one
to
do
this
or
that
and
so
i
perceived
that
apart
from
the
necessity
of
getting
the
boat
into
a
seaworthy
condition
he
was
desirous
to
keep
the
men
busied
for
they
were
become
so
excited
at
the
thought
of
fellow
creatures
almost
within
hail
that
he
could
not
hope
to
keep
them
sufficiently
in
hand
without
some
matter
upon
which
to
employ
them
now
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
had
no
share
of
our
excitement
for
i
noticed
that
he
gave
ever
and
anon
a
glance
to
the
crown
of
the
far
hill
perchance
the
watchman
had
some
news
for
us
yet
the
morning
went
by
and
no
signal
came
to
tell
us
that
the
people
in
the
ship
had
design
to
show
themselves
to
the
man
upon
watch
and
so
we
came
to
dinner
at
this
meal
as
might
be
supposed
we
had
a
second
discussion
upon
the
strangeness
of
the
behavior
of
those
aboard
the
hulk
yet
none
could
give
any
more
reasonable
explanation
than
the
had
given
in
the
morning
and
so
we
left
it
at
that
presently
when
we
had
smoked
and
rested
very
comfortably
for
the
was
no
tyrant
we
rose
at
his
bidding
to
descend
once
more
to
the
beach
but
at
this
moment
one
of
the
men
having
run
to
the
edge
of
the
hill
to
take
a
short
look
at
the
hulk
cried
out
that
a
part
of
the
great
superstructure
over
the
quarter
had
been
removed
or
pushed
back
and
that
there
was
a
figure
there
seeming
so
far
as
his
unaided
sight
could
tell
to
be
looking
through
a
at
the
island
now
it
would
be
difficult
to
tell
of
all
our
excitement
at
this
news
and
we
ran
eagerly
to
see
for
ourselves
if
it
could
be
as
he
informed
us
and
so
it
was
for
we
could
see
the
person
very
clearly
though
remote
and
small
because
of
the
distance
that
he
had
seen
us
we
discovered
in
a
moment
for
he
began
suddenly
to
wave
something
which
i
judged
to
be
the
in
a
very
wild
manner
seeming
also
to
be
jumping
up
and
down
yet
i
doubt
not
but
that
we
were
as
much
excited
for
suddenly
i
discovered
myself
to
be
shouting
with
the
rest
in
a
most
insane
fashion
and
i
was
waving
my
hands
and
running
to
and
fro
upon
the
brow
of
the
hill
then
i
observed
that
the
figure
on
the
hulk
had
disappeared
but
it
was
for
no
more
than
a
moment
and
then
it
was
back
and
there
were
near
a
dozen
with
it
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
some
of
them
were
females
but
the
distance
was
over
great
for
surety
now
these
all
of
them
seeing
us
upon
the
brow
of
the
hill
where
we
must
have
shown
up
plain
against
the
sky
began
at
once
to
wave
in
a
very
frantic
way
and
we
replying
in
like
manner
shouted
ourselves
hoarse
with
vain
greetings
but
soon
we
grew
wearied
of
the
unsatisfactoriness
of
this
method
of
showing
our
excitement
and
one
took
a
piece
of
the
square
canvas
and
let
it
stream
out
into
the
wind
waving
it
to
them
and
another
took
a
second
piece
and
did
likewise
while
a
third
man
rolled
up
a
short
bit
into
a
cone
and
made
use
of
it
as
a
speaking
trumpet
though
i
doubt
if
his
voice
carried
any
the
further
because
of
it
for
my
part
i
had
seized
one
of
the
long
reeds
which
were
lying
about
near
the
fire
and
with
this
i
was
making
a
very
brave
show
and
so
it
may
be
seen
how
very
great
and
genuine
was
our
exaltation
upon
our
discovery
of
these
poor
people
shut
off
from
the
world
within
that
lonesome
craft
then
suddenly
it
seemed
to
come
to
us
to
realize
that
were
among
the
weed
and
upon
the
hilltop
and
that
we
had
no
means
of
bridging
that
which
lay
between
and
at
this
we
faced
one
another
to
discuss
what
we
should
do
to
effect
the
rescue
of
those
within
the
hulk
yet
it
was
little
that
we
could
even
suggest
for
though
one
spoke
of
how
he
had
seen
a
rope
cast
by
means
of
a
mortar
to
a
ship
that
lay
off
shore
yet
this
helped
us
not
for
we
had
no
mortar
but
here
the
same
man
cried
out
that
they
in
the
ship
might
have
such
a
thing
so
that
they
would
be
able
to
shoot
the
rope
to
us
and
at
this
we
thought
more
upon
his
saying
for
if
they
had
such
a
weapon
then
might
our
difficulties
be
solved
yet
we
were
greatly
at
a
loss
to
know
how
we
should
discover
whether
they
were
possessed
of
one
and
further
to
explain
our
design
to
them
but
here
the
came
to
our
help
and
bade
one
man
go
quickly
and
char
some
of
the
reeds
in
the
fire
and
whilst
this
was
doing
he
spread
out
upon
the
rock
one
of
the
spare
lengths
of
canvas
then
he
sung
out
to
the
man
to
bring
him
one
of
the
pieces
of
charred
reed
and
with
this
he
wrote
our
question
upon
the
canvas
calling
for
fresh
charcoal
as
he
required
it
then
having
made
an
end
of
writing
he
bade
two
of
the
men
take
hold
of
the
canvas
by
the
ends
and
expose
it
to
the
view
of
those
in
the
ship
and
in
this
manner
we
got
them
to
understand
our
desires
for
presently
some
of
them
went
away
and
came
back
after
a
little
and
held
up
for
us
to
see
a
very
great
square
of
white
and
upon
it
a
great
no
and
at
this
were
we
again
at
our
wits
ends
to
know
how
it
would
be
possible
to
rescue
those
within
the
ship
for
suddenly
our
whole
desire
to
leave
the
island
was
changed
into
a
determination
to
rescue
the
people
in
the
hulk
and
indeed
had
our
intentions
not
been
such
we
had
been
veritable
curs
though
i
am
happy
to
tell
that
we
had
no
thought
at
this
juncture
but
for
those
who
were
now
looking
to
us
to
restore
them
once
more
to
the
world
to
which
they
had
been
so
long
strangers
now
as
i
have
said
we
were
again
at
our
wits
ends
to
know
how
to
come
at
those
within
the
hulk
and
there
we
stood
all
of
us
talking
together
perchance
we
should
hit
upon
some
plan
and
anon
we
would
turn
and
wave
to
those
who
watched
us
so
anxiously
yet
a
while
passed
and
we
had
come
no
nearer
to
a
method
of
rescue
then
a
thought
came
to
me
waked
perchance
by
the
mention
of
shooting
the
rope
over
to
the
hulk
by
means
of
a
mortar
how
that
i
had
read
once
in
a
book
of
a
fair
maid
whose
lover
effected
her
escape
from
a
castle
by
a
similar
artifice
only
that
in
his
case
he
made
use
of
a
bow
in
place
of
a
mortar
and
a
cord
instead
of
a
rope
his
sweetheart
hauling
up
the
rope
by
means
of
the
cord
now
it
seemed
to
me
a
possible
thing
to
substitute
a
bow
for
the
mortar
if
only
we
could
find
the
material
with
which
to
make
such
a
weapon
and
with
this
in
view
i
took
up
one
of
the
lengths
of
the
reed
and
tried
the
spring
of
it
which
i
found
to
be
very
good
for
this
curious
growth
of
which
i
have
spoken
hitherto
as
a
reed
had
no
resemblance
to
that
plant
beyond
its
appearance
it
being
extraordinarily
tough
and
woody
and
having
considerably
more
nature
than
a
bamboo
now
having
tried
the
spring
of
it
i
went
over
to
the
tent
and
cut
a
piece
of
sampsonline
which
i
found
among
the
gear
and
with
this
and
the
reed
i
contrived
a
rough
bow
then
i
looked
about
until
i
came
upon
a
very
young
and
slender
reed
which
had
been
cut
with
the
rest
and
from
this
i
fashioned
some
sort
of
an
arrow
feathering
it
with
a
piece
of
one
of
the
broad
stiff
leaves
which
grew
upon
the
plant
and
after
that
i
went
forth
to
the
crowd
about
the
leeward
edge
of
the
hill
now
when
they
saw
me
thus
armed
they
seemed
to
think
that
i
intended
a
jest
and
some
of
them
laughed
conceiving
that
it
was
a
very
odd
action
on
my
part
but
when
i
explained
that
which
was
in
my
mind
they
ceased
from
laughter
and
shook
their
heads
making
that
i
did
but
waste
time
for
as
they
said
nothing
save
gunpowder
could
cover
so
great
a
distance
and
after
that
they
turned
again
to
the
with
whom
some
of
them
seemed
to
be
in
argument
and
so
for
a
little
space
i
held
my
peace
and
listened
thus
i
discovered
that
certain
of
the
men
advocated
the
taking
of
the
boat
so
soon
as
it
was
sufficiently
repaired
and
making
a
passage
through
the
weed
to
the
ship
which
they
proposed
to
do
by
cutting
a
narrow
canal
but
the
shook
his
head
and
reminded
them
of
the
great
and
crabs
and
the
worse
things
which
the
weed
concealed
saying
that
those
in
the
ship
would
have
done
it
long
since
had
it
been
possible
and
at
that
the
men
were
silenced
being
robbed
of
their
unreasoning
ardor
by
his
warnings
now
just
at
this
point
there
happened
a
thing
which
proved
the
wisdom
of
that
which
the
contended
for
suddenly
one
of
the
men
cried
out
to
us
to
look
and
at
that
we
turned
quickly
and
saw
that
there
was
a
great
commotion
among
those
who
were
in
the
open
place
in
the
superstructure
for
they
were
running
this
way
and
that
and
some
were
pushing
to
the
slide
which
filled
the
opening
and
then
immediately
we
saw
the
reason
for
their
agitation
and
haste
for
there
was
a
stir
in
the
weed
near
to
the
stem
of
the
ship
and
the
next
instant
monstrous
tentacles
were
reached
up
to
the
place
where
had
been
the
opening
but
the
door
was
shut
and
those
aboard
the
hulk
in
safety
at
this
manifestation
the
men
about
me
who
had
proposed
to
make
use
of
the
boat
and
the
others
also
cried
out
their
horror
of
the
vast
creature
and
i
am
convinced
had
the
rescue
depended
upon
their
use
of
the
boat
then
had
those
in
the
hulk
been
forever
doomed
now
conceiving
that
this
was
a
good
point
at
which
to
renew
my
importunities
i
began
once
again
to
explain
the
probabilities
of
my
plan
succeeding
addressing
myself
more
particularly
to
the
i
told
how
that
i
had
read
that
the
ancients
made
mighty
weapons
some
of
which
could
throw
a
great
stone
so
heavy
as
two
men
over
a
distance
surpassing
a
quarter
of
a
mile
moreover
that
they
compassed
huge
catapults
which
threw
a
lance
or
great
arrow
even
further
on
this
he
expressed
much
surprise
never
having
heard
of
the
like
but
doubted
greatly
that
we
should
be
able
to
construct
such
a
weapon
yet
i
told
him
that
i
was
prepared
for
i
had
the
plan
of
one
clearly
in
my
mind
and
further
i
pointed
out
to
him
that
we
had
the
wind
in
our
favor
and
that
we
were
a
great
height
up
which
would
allow
the
arrow
to
travel
the
farther
before
it
came
so
low
as
the
weed
then
i
stepped
to
the
edge
of
the
hill
and
bidding
him
watch
fitted
my
arrow
to
the
string
and
having
bent
the
bow
loosed
it
whereupon
being
aided
by
the
wind
and
the
height
on
which
i
stood
the
arrow
plunged
into
the
weed
at
a
distance
of
near
two
hundred
yards
from
where
we
stood
that
being
about
a
quarter
of
the
distance
on
the
road
to
the
derelict
at
that
the
was
won
over
to
my
idea
though
as
he
remarked
the
arrow
had
fallen
nearer
had
it
been
drawing
a
length
of
yarn
after
it
and
to
this
i
assented
but
pointed
out
that
my
bow
and
arrow
was
but
a
rough
affair
and
more
that
i
was
no
archer
yet
i
promised
him
with
the
bow
that
i
should
make
to
cast
a
shaft
clean
over
the
hulk
did
he
but
give
me
his
assistance
and
bid
the
men
to
help
now
as
i
have
come
to
regard
it
in
the
light
of
greater
knowledge
my
promise
was
exceeding
rash
but
i
had
faith
in
my
conception
and
was
very
eager
to
put
it
to
the
test
the
which
after
much
discussion
at
supper
it
was
decided
i
should
be
allowed
to
do
xii
the
making
of
the
great
bow
the
fourth
night
upon
the
island
was
the
first
to
pass
without
incident
it
is
true
that
a
light
showed
from
the
hulk
out
in
the
weed
but
now
that
we
had
made
some
acquaintance
with
her
inmates
it
was
no
longer
a
cause
for
excitement
so
much
as
contemplation
as
for
the
valley
where
the
vile
things
had
made
an
end
of
job
it
was
very
silent
and
desolate
under
the
moonlight
for
i
made
a
point
to
go
and
view
it
during
my
time
on
watch
yet
for
all
that
it
lay
empty
it
was
very
eerie
and
a
place
to
conjure
up
uncomfortable
thoughts
so
that
i
spent
no
great
time
pondering
it
this
was
the
second
night
on
which
we
had
been
free
from
the
terror
of
the
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
great
fire
had
put
them
in
fear
of
us
and
driven
them
away
but
of
the
truth
or
error
of
this
idea
i
was
to
learn
later
now
it
must
be
admitted
that
apart
from
a
short
look
into
the
valley
and
occasional
starings
at
the
light
out
in
the
weed
i
gave
little
attention
to
aught
but
my
plans
for
the
great
bow
and
to
such
use
did
i
put
my
time
that
when
i
was
relieved
i
had
each
particular
and
detail
worked
out
so
that
i
knew
very
well
just
what
to
set
the
men
doing
so
soon
as
we
should
make
a
start
in
the
morning
presently
when
the
morning
had
come
and
we
had
made
an
end
of
breakfast
we
upon
the
great
bow
the
directing
the
men
under
my
supervision
now
the
first
matter
to
which
i
bent
attention
was
the
raising
to
the
top
of
the
hill
of
the
remaining
half
of
that
portion
of
the
topmast
which
the
had
split
in
twain
to
procure
the
batten
for
the
boat
to
this
end
we
went
down
all
of
us
to
the
beach
where
lay
the
wreckage
and
getting
about
the
portion
which
i
intended
to
use
carried
it
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
then
we
sent
a
man
to
the
top
to
let
down
the
rope
by
which
we
had
moored
the
boat
to
the
sea
anchor
and
when
we
had
bent
this
on
securely
to
the
piece
of
timber
we
returned
to
the
and
tailed
on
to
the
rope
and
so
presently
after
much
weariful
pulling
had
it
up
the
next
thing
i
desired
was
that
the
split
face
of
the
timber
should
be
rubbed
straight
and
this
the
understood
to
do
and
whilst
he
was
about
it
i
went
with
some
of
the
men
to
the
grove
of
reeds
and
here
with
great
care
i
made
a
selection
of
some
of
the
finest
these
being
for
the
bow
and
after
that
i
cut
some
which
were
very
clean
and
straight
intending
them
for
the
great
arrows
with
these
we
returned
once
more
to
the
camp
and
there
i
and
trimmed
them
of
their
leaves
keeping
these
latter
for
i
had
a
use
for
them
then
i
took
a
dozen
reeds
and
cut
them
each
to
a
length
of
feet
and
afterwards
notched
them
for
the
strings
in
the
meanwhile
i
had
sent
two
men
down
to
the
wreckage
of
the
masts
to
cut
away
a
couple
of
the
hempen
shrouds
and
bring
them
to
the
camp
and
they
appearing
about
this
time
i
set
to
work
to
unlay
the
shrouds
so
that
they
might
get
out
the
fine
white
yarns
which
lay
beneath
the
outer
covering
of
tar
and
blacking
these
when
they
had
come
at
them
we
found
to
be
very
good
and
sound
and
this
being
so
i
bid
them
make
sennit
meaning
it
for
the
strings
of
the
bows
now
it
will
be
observed
that
i
have
said
bows
and
this
i
will
explain
it
had
been
my
original
intention
to
make
one
great
bow
lashing
a
dozen
of
the
reeds
together
for
the
purpose
but
this
upon
pondering
it
i
conceived
to
be
but
a
poor
plan
for
there
would
be
much
life
and
power
lost
in
the
rendering
of
each
piece
through
the
lashings
when
the
bow
was
released
to
obviate
this
and
further
to
compass
the
bending
of
the
bow
the
which
had
at
first
been
a
source
of
puzzlement
to
me
as
to
how
it
was
to
be
accomplished
i
had
determined
to
make
twelve
separate
bows
and
these
i
intended
to
fasten
at
the
end
of
the
stock
one
above
the
other
so
that
they
were
all
in
one
plane
vertically
and
because
of
this
conception
i
should
be
able
to
bend
the
bows
one
at
a
time
and
slip
each
string
over
the
and
afterwards
frap
the
twelve
strings
together
in
the
middle
part
so
that
they
would
be
but
one
string
to
the
butt
of
the
arrow
all
this
i
explained
to
the
who
indeed
had
been
exercised
in
his
own
mind
as
to
how
we
should
be
able
to
bend
such
a
bow
as
i
intended
to
make
and
he
was
mightily
pleased
with
my
method
of
evading
this
difficulty
and
also
one
other
which
else
had
been
greater
than
the
bending
and
that
was
the
of
the
bow
which
would
have
proved
a
very
awkward
work
presently
the
called
out
to
me
that
he
had
got
the
surface
of
the
stock
sufficiently
smooth
and
nice
and
at
that
i
went
over
to
him
for
now
i
wished
him
to
burn
a
slight
groove
down
the
center
running
from
end
to
end
and
this
i
desired
to
be
done
very
exactly
for
upon
it
depended
much
of
the
true
flight
of
the
arrow
then
i
went
back
to
my
own
work
for
i
had
not
yet
finished
notching
the
bows
presently
when
i
had
made
an
end
of
this
i
called
for
a
length
of
the
sennit
and
with
the
aid
of
another
man
contrived
to
string
one
of
the
bows
this
when
i
had
finished
i
found
to
be
very
springy
and
so
stiff
to
bend
that
i
had
all
that
i
could
manage
to
do
so
and
at
this
i
felt
very
satisfied
presently
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
should
do
well
to
set
some
of
the
men
to
work
upon
the
line
which
the
arrow
was
to
carry
for
i
had
determined
that
this
should
be
made
also
from
the
white
hemp
yarns
and
for
the
sake
of
lightness
i
conceived
that
one
thickness
of
yarn
would
be
sufficient
but
so
that
it
might
compass
enough
of
strength
i
bid
them
split
the
yarns
and
lay
the
two
halves
up
together
and
in
this
manner
they
made
me
a
very
light
and
sound
line
though
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
it
was
finished
at
once
for
i
needed
over
half
a
mile
of
it
and
thus
it
was
later
finished
than
the
bow
itself
having
now
gotten
all
things
in
train
i
set
me
down
to
work
upon
one
of
the
arrows
for
i
was
anxious
to
see
what
sort
of
a
fist
i
should
make
of
them
knowing
how
much
would
depend
upon
the
balance
and
truth
of
the
missile
in
the
end
i
made
a
very
fair
one
feathering
it
with
its
own
leaves
and
truing
and
smoothing
it
with
my
knife
after
which
i
inserted
a
small
bolt
in
the
forrard
end
to
act
as
a
head
and
as
i
conceived
give
it
balance
though
whether
i
was
right
in
this
latter
i
am
unable
to
say
yet
before
i
had
finished
my
arrow
the
had
made
the
groove
and
called
me
over
to
him
that
i
might
admire
it
the
which
i
did
for
it
was
done
with
a
wonderful
neatness
now
i
have
been
so
busy
with
my
description
of
how
we
made
the
great
bow
that
i
have
omitted
to
tell
of
the
flight
of
time
and
how
we
had
eaten
our
dinner
this
long
while
since
and
how
that
the
people
in
the
hulk
had
waved
to
us
and
we
had
returned
their
signals
and
then
written
upon
a
length
of
the
canvas
the
one
word
wait
and
besides
all
this
some
had
gathered
our
fuel
for
the
coming
night
and
so
presently
the
evening
came
upon
us
but
we
ceased
not
to
work
for
the
bade
the
men
to
light
a
second
great
fire
beside
our
former
one
and
by
the
light
of
this
we
worked
another
long
spell
though
it
seemed
short
enough
by
reason
of
the
interest
of
the
work
yet
at
last
the
bade
us
to
stop
and
make
supper
which
we
did
and
after
that
he
set
the
watches
and
the
rest
of
us
turned
in
for
we
were
very
weary
in
spite
of
my
previous
weariness
when
the
man
whom
i
relieved
called
me
to
take
my
watch
i
felt
very
fresh
and
wide
awake
and
spent
a
great
part
of
the
time
as
on
the
preceding
night
in
studying
over
my
plans
for
completing
the
great
bow
and
it
was
then
that
i
decided
finally
in
what
manner
i
would
secure
the
bows
athwart
the
end
of
the
stock
for
until
then
i
had
been
in
some
little
doubt
being
divided
between
several
methods
now
however
i
concluded
to
make
twelve
grooves
across
the
sawn
end
of
the
stock
and
fit
the
middles
of
the
bows
into
these
one
above
the
other
as
i
have
already
mentioned
and
then
to
lash
them
at
each
side
to
bolts
driven
into
the
sides
of
the
stock
and
with
this
idea
i
was
very
well
pleased
for
it
promised
to
make
them
secure
and
this
without
any
great
amount
of
work
now
though
i
spent
much
of
my
watch
in
thinking
over
the
details
of
my
prodigious
weapon
yet
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
i
neglected
to
perform
my
duty
as
watchman
for
i
walked
continually
about
the
top
of
the
hill
keeping
my
ready
for
any
sudden
emergency
yet
my
time
passed
off
quietly
enough
though
it
is
true
that
i
witnessed
one
thing
which
brought
me
a
short
spell
of
disquiet
thought
it
was
in
this
wise
i
had
come
to
that
part
of
the
which
overhung
the
valley
and
it
came
to
me
abruptly
to
go
near
to
the
edge
and
look
over
thus
the
moon
being
very
bright
and
the
desolation
of
the
valley
reasonably
clear
to
the
eye
it
appeared
to
me
as
i
looked
that
i
saw
a
movement
among
certain
of
the
fungi
which
had
not
burnt
but
stood
up
shriveled
and
blackened
in
the
valley
yet
by
no
means
could
i
be
sure
that
it
was
not
a
sudden
fancy
born
of
the
eeriness
of
that
desolate
looking
vale
the
more
so
as
i
was
like
to
be
deceived
because
of
the
uncertainty
which
the
light
of
the
moon
gives
yet
to
prove
my
doubts
i
went
back
until
i
had
found
a
piece
of
rock
easy
to
throw
and
this
taking
a
short
run
i
cast
into
the
valley
aiming
at
the
spot
where
it
had
seemed
to
me
that
there
had
been
a
movement
immediately
upon
this
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
some
moving
thing
and
then
more
to
my
right
something
else
stirred
and
at
this
i
looked
towards
it
but
could
discover
nothing
then
looking
back
at
the
clump
at
which
i
had
aimed
my
missile
i
saw
that
the
slime
covered
pool
which
lay
near
was
all
or
so
it
seemed
yet
the
next
instant
i
was
just
as
full
of
doubt
for
even
as
i
watched
it
i
perceived
that
it
was
quite
still
and
after
that
for
some
time
i
kept
a
very
strict
gaze
into
the
valley
yet
could
nowhere
discover
aught
to
prove
my
suspicions
and
at
last
i
ceased
from
watching
it
for
i
feared
to
grow
fanciful
and
so
wandered
to
that
part
of
the
hill
which
overlooked
the
weed
presently
when
i
had
been
relieved
i
returned
to
sleep
and
so
till
the
morning
then
when
we
had
made
each
of
us
a
hasty
breakfast
for
all
were
grown
mightily
keen
to
see
the
great
bow
completed
we
upon
it
each
at
our
appointed
task
thus
the
and
i
made
it
our
work
to
make
the
twelve
grooves
athwart
the
flat
end
of
the
stock
into
which
i
proposed
to
fit
and
lash
the
bows
and
this
we
accomplished
by
means
of
the
iron
which
we
heated
in
its
middle
part
and
then
each
taking
an
end
protecting
our
hands
with
canvas
we
went
one
on
each
side
and
applied
the
iron
until
at
length
we
had
the
grooves
burnt
out
very
nicely
and
accurately
this
work
occupied
us
all
the
morning
for
the
grooves
had
to
be
deeply
burnt
and
in
the
meantime
the
men
had
completed
near
enough
sennit
for
the
stringing
of
the
bows
yet
those
who
were
at
work
on
the
line
which
the
arrow
was
to
carry
had
scarce
made
more
than
half
so
that
i
called
off
one
man
from
the
sennit
to
and
give
them
a
hand
with
the
making
of
the
line
when
dinner
was
ended
the
and
i
about
fitting
the
bows
into
their
places
which
we
did
and
lashed
them
to
bolts
twelve
a
side
driven
into
the
timber
of
the
stock
about
twelve
inches
in
from
the
end
after
this
we
bent
and
strung
the
bows
taking
very
great
care
to
have
each
bent
exactly
as
the
one
below
it
for
we
started
at
the
bottom
and
so
before
sunset
we
had
that
part
of
our
work
ended
now
because
the
two
fires
which
we
had
lit
on
the
previous
night
had
exhausted
our
fuel
the
deemed
it
prudent
to
cease
work
and
go
down
all
of
us
to
bring
up
a
fresh
supply
of
the
dry
seaweed
and
some
bundles
of
the
reeds
this
we
did
making
an
end
of
our
journeyings
just
as
the
dusk
came
over
the
island
then
having
made
a
second
fire
as
on
the
preceding
night
we
had
first
our
supper
and
after
that
another
spell
of
work
all
the
men
turning
to
upon
the
line
which
the
arrow
was
to
carry
whilst
the
and
i
each
of
us
upon
the
making
of
a
fresh
arrow
for
i
had
realized
that
we
should
have
to
make
one
or
two
flights
before
we
could
hope
to
find
our
range
and
make
true
our
aim
later
maybe
about
nine
of
the
night
the
bade
us
all
to
put
away
our
work
and
then
he
set
the
watches
after
which
the
rest
of
us
went
into
the
tent
to
sleep
for
the
strength
of
the
wind
made
the
shelter
a
very
pleasant
thing
that
night
when
it
came
my
turn
to
watch
i
minded
me
to
take
a
look
into
the
valley
but
though
i
watched
at
intervals
through
the
half
of
an
hour
i
saw
nothing
to
lead
me
to
imagine
that
i
had
indeed
seen
aught
on
the
previous
night
and
so
i
felt
more
confident
in
my
mind
that
we
should
be
troubled
no
further
by
the
which
had
destroyed
poor
job
yet
i
must
record
one
thing
which
i
saw
during
my
watch
though
this
was
from
the
edge
of
the
hilltop
which
overlooked
the
and
was
not
in
the
valley
but
in
the
stretch
of
clear
water
which
lay
between
the
island
and
the
weed
as
i
saw
it
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
number
of
great
fish
were
swimming
across
from
the
island
diagonally
towards
the
great
continent
of
weed
they
were
swimming
in
one
wake
and
keeping
a
very
regular
line
but
not
breaking
the
water
after
the
manner
of
porpoises
or
black
fish
yet
though
i
have
mentioned
this
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
i
saw
any
very
strange
thing
in
such
a
sight
and
indeed
i
thought
nothing
more
of
it
than
to
wonder
what
sort
of
fish
they
might
be
for
as
i
saw
them
indistinctly
in
the
moonlight
they
made
a
queer
appearance
seeming
each
of
them
to
be
possessed
of
two
tails
and
further
i
could
have
thought
i
perceived
a
flicker
as
of
tentacles
just
beneath
the
surface
but
of
this
i
was
by
no
means
sure
upon
the
following
morning
having
hurried
our
breakfast
each
of
us
again
upon
our
tasks
for
we
were
in
hopes
to
have
the
great
bow
at
work
before
dinner
soon
the
had
finished
his
arrow
and
mine
was
completed
very
shortly
after
so
that
there
lacked
nothing
now
to
the
completion
of
our
work
save
the
finishing
of
the
line
and
the
getting
of
the
bow
into
position
this
latter
assisted
by
the
men
we
proceeded
now
to
effect
making
a
level
bed
of
rocks
near
the
edge
of
the
hill
which
overlooked
the
weed
upon
this
we
placed
the
great
bow
and
then
having
sent
the
men
back
to
their
work
at
the
line
we
proceeded
to
the
aiming
of
the
huge
weapon
now
when
we
had
gotten
the
instrument
pointed
as
we
conceived
straight
over
the
hulk
the
which
we
accomplished
by
squinting
along
the
groove
which
the
had
burnt
down
the
center
of
the
stock
we
upon
the
arranging
of
the
notch
and
trigger
the
notch
being
to
hold
the
strings
when
the
weapon
was
set
and
the
trigger
a
board
bolted
on
loosely
at
the
side
just
below
the
notch
to
push
them
upwards
out
of
this
place
when
we
desired
to
discharge
the
bow
this
part
of
the
work
took
up
no
great
portion
of
our
time
and
soon
we
had
all
ready
for
our
first
flight
then
we
commenced
to
set
the
bows
bending
the
bottom
one
first
and
then
those
above
in
turn
until
all
were
set
and
after
that
we
laid
the
arrow
very
carefully
in
the
groove
then
i
took
two
pieces
of
spun
yarn
and
frapped
the
strings
together
at
each
end
of
the
notch
and
by
this
means
i
was
assured
that
all
the
strings
would
act
in
unison
when
striking
the
butt
of
the
arrow
and
so
we
had
all
things
ready
for
the
discharge
whereupon
i
placed
my
foot
upon
the
trigger
and
bidding
the
watch
carefully
the
flight
of
the
arrow
pushed
downwards
the
next
instant
with
a
mighty
twang
and
a
quiver
that
made
the
great
stock
stir
on
its
bed
of
rocks
the
bow
sprang
to
its
lesser
tension
hurling
the
arrow
outwards
and
upwards
in
a
vast
arc
now
it
may
be
conceived
with
what
mortal
interest
we
watched
its
flight
and
so
in
a
minute
discovered
that
we
had
aimed
too
much
to
the
right
for
the
arrow
struck
the
weed
ahead
of
the
hulk
but
it
at
that
i
was
filled
near
to
bursting
with
pride
and
joy
and
the
men
who
had
come
forward
to
witness
the
trial
shouted
to
acclaim
my
success
whilst
the
clapped
me
twice
upon
the
shoulder
to
signify
his
regard
and
shouted
as
loud
as
any
and
now
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
had
but
to
get
the
true
aim
and
the
rescue
of
those
in
the
hulk
would
be
but
a
matter
of
another
day
or
two
for
having
once
gotten
a
line
to
the
hulk
we
should
haul
across
a
thin
rope
by
its
means
and
with
this
a
thicker
one
after
which
we
should
set
this
up
so
taut
as
possible
and
then
bring
the
people
in
the
hulk
to
the
island
by
means
of
a
seat
and
block
which
we
should
haul
to
and
fro
along
the
supporting
line
now
having
realized
that
the
bow
would
indeed
carry
so
far
as
the
wreck
we
made
haste
to
try
our
second
arrow
and
at
the
same
time
we
bade
the
men
go
back
to
their
work
upon
the
line
for
we
should
have
need
of
it
in
a
very
little
while
presently
having
pointed
the
bow
more
to
the
left
i
took
the
frappings
off
the
strings
so
that
we
could
bend
the
bows
singly
and
after
that
we
set
the
great
weapon
again
then
seeing
that
the
arrow
was
straight
in
the
groove
i
replaced
the
frappings
and
immediately
discharged
it
this
time
to
my
very
great
pleasure
and
pride
the
arrow
went
with
a
wonderful
straightness
towards
the
ship
and
clearing
the
superstructure
passed
out
of
our
sight
as
it
fell
behind
it
at
this
i
was
all
impatience
to
try
to
get
the
line
to
the
hulk
before
we
made
our
dinner
but
the
men
had
not
yet
sufficient
there
being
then
only
four
hundred
and
fifty
fathoms
which
the
measured
off
by
stretching
it
along
his
arms
and
across
his
chest
this
being
so
we
went
to
dinner
and
made
very
great
haste
through
it
and
after
that
every
one
of
us
worked
at
the
line
and
so
in
about
an
hour
we
had
sufficient
for
i
had
estimated
that
it
would
not
be
wise
to
make
the
attempt
with
a
less
length
than
five
hundred
fathoms
having
now
completed
a
sufficiency
of
the
line
the
set
one
of
the
men
to
flake
it
down
very
carefully
upon
the
rock
beside
the
bow
whilst
he
himself
tested
it
at
all
such
parts
as
he
thought
in
any
way
doubtful
and
so
presently
all
was
ready
then
i
bent
it
on
to
the
arrow
and
having
set
the
bow
whilst
the
men
were
flaking
down
the
line
i
was
prepared
immediately
to
discharge
the
weapon
now
all
the
morning
a
man
upon
the
hulk
had
observed
us
through
a
from
a
position
that
brought
his
head
just
above
the
edge
of
the
superstructure
and
being
aware
of
our
intentions
having
watched
the
previous
flights
he
understood
the
when
he
beckoned
to
him
that
we
had
made
ready
for
a
third
shot
and
so
with
an
answering
wave
of
his
he
disappeared
from
our
sight
at
that
having
first
turned
to
see
that
all
were
clear
of
the
line
i
pressed
down
the
trigger
my
heart
beating
very
fast
and
thick
and
so
in
a
moment
the
arrow
was
sped
but
now
doubtless
because
of
the
weight
of
the
line
it
made
nowhere
near
so
good
a
flight
as
on
the
previous
occasion
the
arrow
striking
the
weed
some
two
hundred
yards
short
of
the
hulk
and
at
this
i
could
near
have
wept
with
vexation
and
disappointment
immediately
upon
the
failure
of
my
shot
the
called
to
the
men
to
haul
in
the
line
very
carefully
so
that
it
should
not
be
parted
through
the
arrow
catching
in
the
weed
then
he
came
over
to
me
and
proposed
that
we
should
at
once
to
make
a
heavier
arrow
suggesting
that
it
had
been
lack
of
weight
in
the
missile
which
had
caused
it
to
fall
short
at
that
i
felt
once
more
hopeful
and
at
once
to
prepare
a
new
arrow
the
doing
likewise
though
in
his
case
he
intended
to
make
a
lighter
one
than
that
which
had
failed
for
as
he
put
it
though
the
heavier
one
fell
short
yet
might
the
lighter
succeed
and
if
neither
then
we
could
only
suppose
that
the
bow
lacked
power
to
carry
the
line
and
in
that
case
we
should
have
to
try
some
other
method
now
in
about
two
hours
i
had
made
my
arrow
the
having
finished
his
a
little
earlier
and
so
the
men
having
hauled
in
all
the
line
and
flaked
it
down
ready
we
prepared
to
make
another
attempt
to
cast
it
over
the
hulk
yet
a
second
time
we
failed
and
by
so
much
that
it
seemed
hopeless
to
think
of
success
but
for
all
that
it
appeared
useless
the
insisted
on
making
a
last
try
with
the
light
arrow
and
presently
when
we
had
gotten
the
line
ready
again
we
loosed
upon
the
wreck
but
in
this
case
so
lamentable
was
our
failure
that
i
cried
out
to
the
to
set
the
useless
thing
upon
the
fire
and
burn
it
for
i
was
sorely
irked
by
its
failure
and
could
scarce
abide
to
speak
civilly
of
it
now
the
perceiving
how
i
felt
sung
out
that
we
would
cease
troubling
about
the
hulk
for
the
present
and
go
down
all
of
us
to
gather
reeds
and
weed
for
the
fire
for
it
was
drawing
nigh
to
evening
and
this
we
did
though
all
in
a
disconsolate
condition
of
mind
for
we
had
seemed
so
near
to
success
and
now
it
appeared
to
be
further
than
ever
from
us
and
so
in
a
while
having
brought
up
a
sufficiency
of
fuel
the
sent
two
of
the
men
down
to
one
of
the
ledges
which
overhung
the
sea
and
bade
them
see
whether
they
could
not
secure
a
fish
for
our
supper
then
taking
our
places
about
the
fire
we
upon
a
discussion
as
to
how
we
should
come
at
the
people
in
the
hulk
now
for
a
while
there
came
no
suggestion
worthy
of
notice
until
at
last
there
occurred
to
me
a
notable
idea
and
i
called
out
suddenly
that
we
should
make
a
small
fire
balloon
and
float
off
the
line
to
them
by
such
means
at
that
the
men
about
the
fire
were
silent
a
moment
for
the
idea
was
new
to
them
and
moreover
they
needed
to
comprehend
just
what
i
meant
then
when
they
had
come
fully
at
it
the
one
who
had
proposed
that
they
should
make
spears
of
their
knives
cried
out
to
know
why
a
kite
would
not
do
and
at
that
i
was
confounded
in
that
so
simple
an
expedient
had
not
occurred
to
any
before
for
surely
it
would
be
but
a
little
matter
to
float
a
line
to
them
by
means
of
a
kite
and
further
such
a
thing
would
take
no
great
making
and
so
after
a
space
of
talk
it
was
decided
that
upon
the
morrow
we
should
build
some
sort
of
kite
and
with
it
fly
a
line
over
the
hulk
the
which
should
be
a
task
of
no
great
difficulty
with
so
good
a
breeze
as
we
had
continually
with
us
and
presently
having
made
our
supper
off
a
very
fine
fish
which
the
two
fishermen
had
caught
whilst
we
talked
the
set
the
watches
and
the
rest
xiii
the
weed
men
now
on
that
night
when
i
came
to
my
watch
i
discovered
that
there
was
no
moon
and
save
for
such
light
as
the
fire
threw
the
was
in
darkness
yet
this
was
no
great
matter
to
trouble
me
for
we
had
been
unmolested
since
the
burning
of
the
fungi
in
the
valley
and
thus
i
had
lost
much
of
the
haunting
fear
which
had
beset
me
upon
the
death
of
job
yet
though
i
was
not
so
much
afraid
as
i
had
been
i
took
all
precautions
that
suggested
themselves
to
me
and
built
up
the
fire
to
a
goodly
height
after
which
i
took
my
and
made
the
round
of
the
camping
place
at
the
edges
of
the
cliffs
which
protected
us
on
three
sides
i
made
some
pause
staring
down
into
the
darkness
and
listening
though
this
latter
was
of
but
small
use
because
of
the
strength
of
the
wind
which
roared
continually
in
my
ears
yet
though
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
i
was
presently
possessed
of
a
strange
uneasiness
which
made
me
return
twice
or
thrice
to
the
edge
of
the
cliffs
but
always
without
seeing
or
hearing
anything
to
justify
my
superstitions
and
so
presently
being
determined
to
give
way
to
no
fancifulness
i
avoided
the
boundary
of
cliffs
and
kept
more
to
that
part
which
commanded
the
slope
up
and
down
which
we
made
our
journeys
to
and
from
the
island
below
then
it
would
be
near
halfway
through
my
time
of
watching
there
came
to
me
out
of
the
immensity
of
weed
that
lay
to
leeward
a
far
distant
sound
that
grew
upon
my
ear
rising
and
rising
into
a
fearsome
screaming
and
shrieking
and
then
dying
away
into
the
distance
in
queer
sobs
and
so
at
last
to
a
note
below
that
of
the
wind
at
this
as
might
be
supposed
i
was
somewhat
shaken
in
myself
to
hear
so
dread
a
noise
coming
out
of
all
that
desolation
and
then
suddenly
the
thought
came
to
me
that
the
screaming
was
from
the
ship
to
leeward
of
us
and
i
ran
immediately
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
overlooking
the
weed
and
stared
into
the
darkness
but
now
i
perceived
by
a
light
which
burned
in
the
hulk
that
the
screaming
had
come
from
some
place
a
great
distance
to
the
right
of
her
and
more
as
my
sense
assured
me
it
could
by
no
means
have
been
possible
for
those
in
her
to
have
sent
their
voices
to
me
against
such
a
breeze
as
blew
at
that
time
and
so
for
a
space
i
stood
nervously
pondering
and
peering
away
into
the
blackness
of
the
night
thus
in
a
little
i
perceived
a
dull
glow
upon
the
horizon
and
presently
there
rose
into
view
the
upper
edge
of
the
moon
and
a
very
welcome
sight
it
was
to
me
for
i
had
been
upon
the
point
of
calling
the
to
inform
him
regarding
the
sound
which
i
had
heard
but
i
had
hesitated
being
afraid
to
seem
foolish
if
nothing
should
befall
then
even
as
i
stood
watching
the
moon
rise
into
view
there
came
again
to
me
the
beginning
of
that
screaming
somewhat
like
to
the
sound
of
a
woman
sobbing
with
a
giant
voice
and
it
grew
and
strengthened
until
it
pierced
through
the
roar
of
the
wind
with
an
amazing
clearness
and
then
slowly
and
seeming
to
echo
and
echo
it
sank
away
into
the
distance
and
there
was
again
in
my
ears
no
sound
beyond
that
of
the
wind
at
this
having
looked
fixedly
in
the
direction
from
which
the
sound
had
proceeded
i
ran
straightway
to
the
tent
and
roused
the
for
i
had
no
knowledge
of
what
the
noise
might
portend
and
this
second
cry
had
shaken
from
me
all
my
bashfulness
now
the
was
upon
his
feet
almost
before
i
had
made
an
end
of
shaking
him
and
catching
up
his
great
cutlass
which
he
kept
always
by
his
side
he
followed
me
swiftly
out
on
to
the
here
i
explained
to
him
that
i
had
heard
a
very
fearsome
sound
which
had
appeared
to
proceed
out
of
the
vastness
of
the
and
that
upon
a
repetition
of
the
noise
i
had
decided
to
call
him
for
i
knew
not
but
that
it
might
signal
to
us
of
some
coming
danger
at
that
the
commended
me
though
chiding
me
in
that
i
had
hesitated
to
call
him
at
the
first
occurrence
of
the
crying
and
then
following
me
to
the
edge
of
the
leeward
cliff
he
stood
there
with
me
waiting
and
listening
perchance
there
might
come
again
a
recurrence
of
the
noise
for
perhaps
something
over
an
hour
we
stood
there
very
silent
and
listening
but
there
came
to
us
no
sound
beyond
the
continuous
noise
of
the
wind
and
so
by
that
time
having
grown
somewhat
impatient
of
waiting
and
the
moon
being
well
risen
the
beckoned
to
me
to
make
the
round
of
the
camp
with
him
now
just
as
i
turned
away
chancing
to
look
downward
at
the
clear
water
directly
below
i
was
amazed
to
see
that
an
innumerable
multitude
of
great
fish
like
unto
those
which
i
had
seen
on
the
previous
night
were
swimming
from
the
towards
the
island
at
that
i
stepped
nearer
the
edge
for
they
came
so
directly
towards
the
island
that
i
expected
to
see
them
close
inshore
yet
i
could
not
perceive
one
for
they
seemed
all
of
them
to
vanish
at
a
point
some
thirty
yards
distant
from
the
beach
and
at
that
being
amazed
both
by
the
numbers
of
the
fish
and
their
strangeness
and
the
way
in
which
they
came
on
continually
yet
never
reached
the
shore
i
called
to
the
to
come
and
see
for
he
had
gone
on
a
few
paces
upon
hearing
my
call
he
came
running
back
whereat
i
pointed
into
the
sea
below
at
that
he
stooped
forward
and
peered
very
intently
and
i
with
him
yet
neither
one
of
us
could
discover
the
meaning
of
so
curious
an
exhibition
and
so
for
a
while
we
watched
the
being
quite
so
much
interested
as
i
presently
however
he
turned
away
saying
that
we
did
foolishly
to
stand
here
peering
at
every
curious
sight
when
we
should
be
looking
to
the
welfare
of
the
camp
and
so
we
began
to
go
the
round
of
the
now
whilst
we
had
been
watching
and
listening
we
had
suffered
the
fire
to
die
down
to
a
most
unwise
lowness
and
consequently
though
the
moon
was
rising
there
was
by
no
means
the
same
brightness
that
should
have
made
the
camp
light
on
perceiving
this
i
went
forward
to
throw
some
fuel
on
to
the
fire
and
then
even
as
i
moved
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
saw
something
stir
in
the
shadow
of
the
tent
and
at
that
i
ran
towards
the
place
uttering
a
shout
and
waving
my
yet
i
found
nothing
and
so
feeling
somewhat
foolish
i
turned
to
make
up
the
fire
as
had
been
my
intention
and
whilst
i
was
thus
busied
the
came
running
over
to
me
to
know
what
i
had
seen
and
in
the
same
instant
there
ran
three
of
the
men
out
of
the
tent
all
of
them
waked
by
my
sudden
cry
but
i
had
naught
to
tell
them
save
that
my
fancy
had
played
me
a
trick
and
had
shown
me
something
where
my
eyes
could
find
nothing
and
at
that
two
of
the
men
went
back
to
resume
their
sleep
but
the
third
the
big
fellow
to
whom
the
had
given
the
other
cutlass
came
with
us
bringing
his
weapon
and
though
he
kept
silent
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
had
gathered
something
of
our
uneasiness
and
for
my
part
i
was
not
sorry
to
have
his
company
presently
we
came
to
that
portion
of
the
hill
which
overhung
the
valley
and
i
went
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
intending
to
peer
over
for
the
valley
had
a
very
unholy
fascination
for
me
yet
no
sooner
had
i
glanced
down
than
i
started
and
ran
back
to
the
and
plucked
him
by
the
sleeve
and
at
that
perceiving
my
agitation
he
came
with
me
in
silence
to
see
what
matter
had
caused
me
so
much
quiet
excitement
now
when
he
looked
over
he
also
was
astounded
and
drew
back
instantly
then
using
great
caution
he
bent
forward
once
more
and
stared
down
and
at
that
the
big
seaman
came
up
behind
walking
upon
his
toes
and
stooped
to
see
what
manner
of
thing
we
had
discovered
thus
we
each
of
us
stared
down
upon
a
most
unearthly
sight
for
the
valley
all
beneath
us
was
with
moving
creatures
white
and
unwholesome
in
the
moonlight
and
their
movements
were
somewhat
like
the
movements
of
monstrous
slugs
though
the
things
themselves
had
no
resemblance
to
such
in
their
contours
but
minded
me
of
naked
humans
very
fleshy
and
crawling
upon
their
stomachs
yet
their
movements
lacked
not
a
surprising
rapidity
and
now
looking
a
little
over
the
shoulder
i
discovered
that
these
hideous
things
were
coming
up
out
from
the
pool
in
the
bottom
of
the
valley
and
suddenly
i
was
minded
of
the
multitudes
of
strange
fish
which
we
had
seen
swimming
towards
the
island
but
which
had
all
disappeared
before
reaching
the
shore
and
i
had
no
doubt
but
that
they
entered
the
pit
through
some
natural
passage
known
to
them
beneath
the
water
and
now
i
was
made
to
understand
my
thought
of
the
previous
night
that
i
had
seen
the
flicker
of
tentacles
for
these
things
below
us
had
each
two
short
and
stumpy
arms
but
the
ends
appeared
divided
into
hateful
and
wriggling
masses
of
small
tentacles
which
slid
hither
and
thither
as
the
creatures
moved
about
the
bottom
of
the
valley
and
at
their
hinder
ends
where
they
should
have
grown
feet
there
seemed
other
flickering
bunches
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
we
saw
these
things
clearly
now
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
convey
the
extraordinary
disgust
which
the
sight
of
these
human
slugs
bred
in
me
nor
could
i
do
i
think
i
would
for
were
i
successful
then
would
others
be
like
to
retch
even
as
i
did
the
spasm
coming
on
without
premonition
and
born
of
very
horror
and
then
suddenly
even
as
i
stared
sick
with
loathing
and
apprehension
there
came
into
view
not
a
fathom
below
my
feet
a
face
like
to
the
face
which
had
peered
up
into
my
own
on
that
night
as
we
drifted
beside
the
at
that
i
could
have
screamed
had
i
been
in
less
terror
for
the
great
eyes
so
big
as
crown
pieces
the
bill
like
to
an
inverted
parrot
and
the
undulating
of
its
white
and
slimy
body
bred
in
me
the
dumbness
of
one
mortally
stricken
and
even
as
i
stayed
there
my
helpless
body
bent
and
rigid
the
spat
a
mighty
curse
into
my
ear
and
leaning
forward
smote
at
the
thing
with
his
cutlass
for
in
the
instant
that
i
had
seen
it
it
had
advanced
upward
by
so
much
as
a
yard
now
at
this
action
of
the
i
came
suddenly
into
possession
of
myself
and
thrust
downward
with
so
much
vigor
that
i
was
like
to
have
followed
the
brute
carcass
for
i
overbalanced
and
danced
giddily
for
a
moment
upon
the
edge
of
eternity
and
then
the
had
me
by
the
waistband
and
i
was
back
in
safety
but
in
that
instant
through
which
i
had
struggled
for
my
balance
i
had
discovered
that
the
face
of
the
cliff
was
near
hid
with
the
number
of
the
things
which
were
making
up
to
us
and
i
turned
to
the
crying
out
to
him
that
there
were
thousands
of
them
swarming
up
to
us
yet
he
was
gone
already
from
me
running
towards
the
fire
and
shouting
to
the
men
in
the
tent
to
haste
to
our
help
for
their
very
lives
and
then
he
came
racing
back
with
a
great
armful
of
the
weed
and
after
him
came
the
big
seaman
carrying
a
burning
tuft
from
the
camp
fire
and
so
in
a
few
moments
we
had
a
blaze
and
the
men
were
bringing
more
weed
for
we
had
a
very
good
stock
upon
the
for
which
the
almighty
be
thanked
now
scarce
had
we
lit
one
fire
when
the
cried
out
to
the
big
seaman
to
make
another
further
along
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
in
the
same
instant
i
shouted
and
ran
over
to
that
part
of
the
hill
which
lay
towards
the
open
sea
for
i
had
seen
a
number
of
moving
things
about
the
edge
of
the
seaward
cliff
now
here
there
was
a
deal
of
shadow
for
there
were
scattered
certain
large
masses
of
rock
about
this
part
of
the
hill
and
these
held
off
both
the
light
of
the
moon
and
that
from
the
fires
here
i
came
abruptly
upon
three
great
shapes
moving
with
stealthiness
towards
the
camp
and
behind
these
i
saw
dimly
that
there
were
others
then
with
a
loud
cry
for
help
i
made
at
the
three
and
as
i
charged
they
rose
up
on
end
at
me
and
i
found
that
they
overtopped
me
and
their
vile
tentacles
were
reached
out
at
me
then
i
was
smiting
and
gasping
sick
with
a
sudden
stench
the
stench
of
the
creatures
which
i
had
come
already
to
know
and
then
something
clutched
at
me
something
slimy
and
vile
and
great
mandibles
champed
in
my
face
but
i
stabbed
upward
and
the
thing
fell
from
me
leaving
me
dazed
and
sick
and
smiting
weakly
then
there
came
a
rush
of
feet
behind
and
a
sudden
blaze
and
the
crying
out
encouragement
and
directly
he
and
the
big
seaman
thrust
themselves
in
front
of
me
hurling
from
them
great
masses
of
burning
weed
which
they
had
borne
each
of
them
up
a
long
reed
and
immediately
the
things
were
gone
slithering
hastily
down
over
the
cliff
edge
and
so
presently
i
was
more
my
own
man
and
made
to
wipe
from
my
throat
the
slime
left
by
the
clutch
of
the
monster
and
afterwards
i
ran
from
fire
to
fire
with
weed
feeding
them
and
so
a
space
passed
during
which
we
had
safety
for
by
that
time
we
had
fires
all
about
the
top
of
the
hill
and
the
monsters
were
in
mortal
dread
of
fire
else
had
we
been
dead
all
of
us
that
night
now
a
while
before
the
dawn
we
discovered
for
the
second
time
since
we
had
been
upon
the
island
that
our
fuel
could
not
last
us
the
night
at
the
rate
at
which
we
were
compelled
to
burn
it
and
so
the
told
the
men
to
let
out
every
second
fire
and
thus
we
staved
off
for
a
while
the
time
when
we
should
have
to
face
a
spell
of
darkness
and
the
things
which
at
present
the
fires
held
off
from
us
and
so
at
last
we
came
to
the
end
of
the
weed
and
the
reeds
and
the
called
out
to
us
to
watch
the
cliff
edges
very
carefully
and
smite
on
the
instant
that
any
thing
showed
but
that
should
he
call
all
were
to
gather
by
the
central
fire
for
a
last
stand
and
after
that
he
blasted
the
moon
which
had
passed
behind
a
great
bank
of
cloud
and
thus
matters
were
and
the
gloom
deepened
as
the
fires
sank
lower
and
lower
then
i
heard
a
man
curse
on
that
part
of
the
hill
which
lay
towards
the
his
cry
coming
up
to
me
against
the
wind
and
the
shouted
to
us
to
all
have
a
care
and
directly
afterwards
i
smote
at
something
that
rose
silently
above
the
edge
of
the
cliff
opposite
to
where
i
watched
perhaps
a
minute
passed
and
then
there
came
shouts
from
all
parts
of
the
hilltop
and
i
knew
that
the
weed
men
were
upon
us
and
in
the
same
instant
there
came
two
above
the
edge
near
me
rising
with
a
ghostly
quietness
yet
moving
lithely
now
the
first
i
pierced
somewhere
in
the
throat
and
it
fell
backward
but
the
second
though
i
thrust
it
through
caught
my
blade
with
a
bunch
of
its
tentacles
and
was
like
to
have
snatched
it
from
me
but
that
i
kicked
it
in
the
face
and
at
that
being
i
believe
more
astonished
than
hurt
it
loosed
my
sword
and
immediately
fell
away
out
of
sight
now
this
had
taken
in
all
no
more
than
some
ten
seconds
yet
already
i
perceived
so
many
as
four
others
coming
into
view
a
little
to
my
right
and
at
that
it
seemed
to
me
that
our
deaths
must
be
very
near
for
i
knew
not
how
we
were
to
cope
with
the
creatures
coming
as
they
were
so
boldly
and
with
such
rapidity
yet
i
hesitated
not
but
ran
at
them
and
now
i
thrust
not
but
cut
at
their
faces
and
found
this
to
be
very
effectual
for
in
this
wise
disposed
i
of
three
in
as
many
strokes
but
the
fourth
had
come
right
over
the
cliff
edge
and
rose
up
at
me
upon
its
hinder
parts
as
had
done
those
others
when
the
had
succored
me
at
that
i
gave
way
having
a
very
lively
dread
but
hearing
all
about
me
the
cries
of
conflict
and
knowing
that
i
could
expect
no
help
i
made
at
the
brute
then
as
it
stooped
and
reached
out
one
of
its
bunches
of
tentacles
i
sprang
back
and
slashed
at
them
and
immediately
i
followed
this
up
by
a
thrust
in
the
stomach
and
at
that
it
collapsed
into
a
writhing
white
ball
that
rolled
this
way
and
that
and
so
in
its
agony
coming
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
it
fell
over
and
i
was
left
sick
and
near
helpless
with
the
hateful
stench
of
the
brutes
now
by
this
time
all
the
fires
about
the
edges
of
the
hill
were
sunken
into
dull
glowing
mounds
of
embers
though
that
which
burnt
near
to
the
entrance
of
the
tent
was
still
of
a
good
brightness
yet
this
helped
us
but
little
for
we
fought
too
far
beyond
the
immediate
circle
of
its
beams
to
have
benefit
of
it
and
still
the
moon
at
which
now
i
threw
a
despairing
glance
was
no
more
than
a
ghostly
shape
behind
the
great
bank
of
cloud
which
was
passing
over
it
then
even
as
i
looked
upward
glancing
as
it
might
be
over
my
left
shoulder
i
saw
with
a
sudden
horror
that
something
had
come
anigh
me
and
upon
the
instant
i
caught
the
reek
of
the
thing
and
leapt
fearfully
to
one
side
turning
as
i
sprang
thus
was
i
saved
in
the
very
moment
of
my
destruction
for
the
creature
tentacles
smeared
the
back
of
my
neck
as
i
leapt
and
then
i
had
smitten
once
and
again
and
conquered
immediately
after
this
i
discovered
something
to
be
crossing
the
dark
space
that
lay
between
the
dull
mound
of
the
nearest
fire
and
that
which
lay
further
along
the
and
so
wasting
no
moment
of
time
i
ran
towards
the
thing
and
cut
it
twice
across
the
head
before
ever
it
could
get
upon
its
hind
parts
in
which
position
i
had
learned
greatly
to
dread
them
yet
no
sooner
had
i
slain
this
one
than
there
came
a
rush
of
maybe
a
dozen
upon
me
these
having
climbed
silently
over
the
cliff
edge
in
the
meanwhile
at
this
i
dodged
and
ran
madly
towards
the
glowing
mound
of
the
nearest
fire
the
brutes
following
me
almost
so
quick
as
i
could
run
but
i
came
to
the
fire
the
first
and
then
a
sudden
thought
coming
to
me
i
thrust
the
point
of
my
among
the
embers
and
switched
a
great
shower
of
them
at
the
creatures
and
at
that
i
had
a
momentary
clear
vision
of
many
white
hideous
faces
stretched
out
towards
me
and
brown
champing
mandibles
which
had
the
upper
beak
shutting
into
the
lower
and
the
clumped
wriggling
tentacles
were
all
then
the
gloom
came
again
but
immediately
i
switched
another
and
yet
another
shower
of
the
burning
embers
towards
them
and
so
directly
i
saw
them
give
back
and
then
they
were
gone
at
this
all
about
the
edges
of
the
hilltop
i
saw
the
fires
being
scattered
in
like
manner
for
others
had
adopted
this
device
to
help
them
in
their
sore
straits
for
a
little
after
this
i
had
a
short
breathing
space
the
brutes
seeming
to
have
taken
fright
yet
i
was
full
of
trembling
and
i
glanced
hither
and
thither
not
knowing
when
some
one
or
more
of
them
would
come
upon
me
and
ever
i
glanced
towards
the
moon
and
prayed
the
almighty
that
the
clouds
would
pass
quickly
else
should
we
be
all
dead
men
and
then
as
i
prayed
there
rose
a
sudden
very
terrible
scream
from
one
of
the
men
and
in
the
same
moment
there
came
something
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
fronting
me
but
i
cleft
it
or
ever
it
could
rise
higher
and
in
my
ears
there
echoed
still
the
sudden
scream
which
had
come
from
that
part
of
the
hill
which
lay
to
the
left
of
me
yet
i
dared
not
to
leave
my
station
for
to
have
done
so
would
have
been
to
have
risked
all
and
so
i
stayed
tortured
by
the
strain
of
ignorance
and
my
own
terror
again
i
had
a
little
spell
in
which
i
was
free
from
molestation
nothing
coming
into
sight
so
far
as
i
could
see
to
right
or
left
of
me
though
others
were
less
fortunate
as
the
curses
and
sounds
of
blows
told
to
me
and
then
abruptly
there
came
another
cry
of
pain
and
i
looked
up
again
to
the
moon
and
prayed
aloud
that
it
might
come
out
to
show
some
light
before
we
were
all
destroyed
but
it
remained
hid
then
a
sudden
thought
came
into
my
brain
and
i
shouted
at
the
top
of
my
voice
to
the
to
set
the
great
upon
the
central
fire
for
thus
we
should
have
a
big
blaze
the
wood
being
very
nice
and
dry
twice
i
shouted
to
him
saying
burn
the
bow
burn
the
bow
and
immediately
he
replied
shouting
to
all
the
men
to
run
to
him
and
carry
it
to
the
fire
and
this
we
did
and
bore
it
to
the
center
fire
and
then
ran
back
with
all
speed
to
our
places
thus
in
a
minute
we
had
some
light
and
the
light
grew
as
the
fire
took
hold
of
the
great
log
the
wind
fanning
it
to
a
blaze
and
so
i
faced
outwards
looking
to
see
if
any
vile
face
showed
above
the
edge
before
me
or
to
my
right
or
left
yet
i
saw
nothing
save
as
it
seemed
to
me
once
a
fluttering
tentacle
came
up
a
little
to
my
right
but
nothing
else
for
a
space
perhaps
it
was
near
five
minutes
later
that
there
came
another
attack
and
in
this
i
came
near
to
losing
my
life
through
my
folly
in
venturing
too
near
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
for
suddenly
there
shot
up
out
from
the
darkness
below
a
clump
of
tentacles
and
caught
me
about
the
left
ankle
and
immediately
i
was
pulled
to
a
sitting
posture
so
that
both
my
feet
were
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
and
it
was
only
by
the
mercy
of
god
that
i
had
not
plunged
head
foremost
into
the
valley
yet
as
it
was
i
suffered
a
mighty
peril
for
the
brute
that
had
my
foot
put
a
vast
strain
upon
it
trying
to
pull
me
down
but
i
resisted
using
my
hands
and
seat
to
sustain
me
and
so
discovering
that
it
could
not
compass
my
end
in
this
wise
it
slacked
somewhat
of
the
stress
and
bit
at
my
boot
shearing
through
the
hard
leather
and
nigh
destroying
my
small
toe
but
now
being
no
longer
compelled
to
use
both
hands
to
retain
my
position
i
slashed
down
with
great
fury
being
maddened
by
the
pain
and
the
mortal
fear
which
the
creature
had
put
upon
me
yet
i
was
not
immediately
free
of
the
brute
for
it
caught
my
sword
blade
but
i
snatched
it
away
before
it
could
take
a
proper
hold
mayhaps
cutting
its
feelers
somewhat
thereby
though
of
this
i
can
not
be
sure
for
they
seemed
not
to
grip
around
a
thing
but
to
to
it
then
in
a
moment
by
a
lucky
blow
i
maimed
it
so
that
it
loosed
me
and
i
was
able
to
get
back
into
some
condition
of
security
and
from
this
onwards
we
were
free
from
molestation
though
we
had
no
knowledge
but
that
the
quietness
of
the
weed
men
did
but
portend
a
fresh
attack
and
so
at
last
it
came
to
the
dawn
and
in
all
this
time
the
moon
came
not
to
our
help
being
quite
hid
by
the
clouds
which
now
covered
the
whole
arc
of
the
sky
making
the
dawn
of
a
very
desolate
aspect
and
so
soon
as
there
was
a
sufficiency
of
light
we
examined
the
valley
but
there
were
nowhere
any
of
the
weed
men
no
nor
even
any
of
their
dead
for
it
seemed
that
they
had
carried
off
all
such
and
their
wounded
and
so
we
had
no
opportunity
to
make
an
examination
of
the
monsters
by
daylight
yet
though
we
could
not
come
upon
their
dead
all
about
the
edges
of
the
cliffs
was
blood
and
slime
and
from
the
latter
there
came
ever
the
hideous
stench
which
marked
the
brutes
but
from
this
we
suffered
little
the
wind
carrying
it
far
away
to
leeward
and
filling
our
lungs
with
sweet
and
wholesome
air
presently
seeing
that
the
danger
was
past
the
called
us
to
the
center
fire
on
which
burnt
still
the
remnants
of
the
great
bow
and
here
we
discovered
for
the
first
time
that
one
of
the
men
was
gone
from
us
at
that
we
made
search
about
the
hilltop
and
afterwards
in
the
valley
and
about
the
island
but
found
him
not
xiv
in
communication
now
of
the
search
which
we
made
through
the
valley
for
the
body
of
tompkins
that
being
the
name
of
the
lost
man
i
have
some
doleful
memories
but
first
before
we
left
the
camp
the
gave
us
all
a
very
sound
tot
of
the
rum
and
also
a
biscuit
apiece
and
thereafter
we
hasted
down
each
man
holding
his
weapon
readily
presently
when
we
were
come
to
the
beach
which
ended
the
valley
upon
the
seaward
side
the
led
us
along
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
where
the
precipices
came
down
into
the
softer
stuff
which
covered
the
valley
and
here
we
made
a
careful
search
perchance
he
had
fallen
over
and
lay
dead
or
wounded
near
to
our
hands
but
it
was
not
so
and
after
that
we
went
down
to
the
mouth
of
the
great
pit
and
here
we
discovered
the
mud
all
about
it
to
be
covered
with
multitudes
of
tracks
and
in
addition
to
these
and
the
slime
we
found
many
traces
of
blood
but
nowhere
any
signs
of
tompkins
and
so
having
searched
all
the
valley
we
came
out
upon
the
weed
which
strewed
the
shore
nearer
to
the
great
but
discovered
nothing
until
we
had
made
up
towards
the
foot
of
the
hill
where
it
came
down
sheer
into
the
sea
here
i
climbed
on
to
a
ledge
the
same
from
which
the
men
had
caught
their
fish
thinking
that
if
tompkins
had
fallen
from
above
he
might
lie
in
the
water
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
which
was
here
maybe
some
ten
to
twenty
feet
deep
but
for
a
little
space
i
saw
nothing
then
suddenly
i
discovered
that
there
was
something
white
down
in
the
sea
away
to
my
left
and
at
that
i
climbed
farther
out
along
the
ledge
in
this
wise
i
perceived
that
the
thing
which
had
attracted
my
notice
was
the
dead
body
of
one
of
the
weed
men
i
could
see
it
but
dimly
catching
odd
glimpses
of
it
as
the
surface
of
the
water
smoothed
at
whiles
it
appeared
to
me
to
be
lying
curled
up
and
somewhat
upon
its
right
side
and
in
proof
that
it
was
dead
i
saw
a
mighty
wound
that
had
come
near
to
shearing
away
the
head
and
so
after
a
further
glance
i
came
in
and
told
what
i
had
seen
at
that
being
convinced
by
this
time
that
tompkins
was
indeed
done
to
death
we
ceased
our
search
but
first
before
we
left
the
spot
the
climbed
out
to
get
a
sight
of
the
dead
weed
man
and
after
him
the
rest
of
the
men
for
they
were
greatly
curious
to
see
clearly
what
manner
of
creature
it
was
that
had
attacked
us
in
the
night
presently
having
seen
so
much
of
the
brute
as
the
water
would
allow
they
came
in
again
to
the
beach
and
afterwards
were
returned
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
island
and
so
being
there
we
crossed
over
to
the
boat
to
see
whether
it
had
been
harmed
but
found
it
to
be
untouched
yet
that
the
creatures
had
been
all
about
it
we
could
perceive
by
the
marks
of
slime
upon
the
sand
and
also
by
the
strange
trail
which
they
had
left
in
the
soft
surface
then
one
of
the
men
called
out
that
there
had
been
something
at
job
grave
which
as
will
be
remembered
had
been
made
in
the
sand
some
little
distance
from
the
place
of
our
first
camp
at
that
we
looked
all
of
us
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
it
had
been
disturbed
and
so
we
ran
hastily
to
it
knowing
not
what
to
fear
thus
we
found
it
to
be
empty
for
the
monsters
had
digged
down
to
the
poor
lad
body
and
of
it
we
could
discover
no
sign
upon
this
we
came
to
a
greater
horror
of
the
weed
men
than
ever
for
we
knew
them
now
to
be
foul
ghouls
who
could
not
let
even
the
dead
body
rest
in
the
grave
now
after
this
the
led
us
all
back
to
the
and
there
he
looked
to
our
hurts
for
one
man
had
lost
two
fingers
in
the
fray
another
had
been
bitten
savagely
in
the
left
arm
whilst
a
third
had
all
the
skin
of
his
face
raised
in
wheals
where
one
of
the
brutes
had
fixed
its
tentacles
and
all
of
these
had
received
but
scant
attention
because
of
the
stress
of
the
fight
and
after
that
through
the
discovery
that
tompkins
was
missing
now
however
the
upon
them
washing
and
binding
them
up
and
for
dressings
he
made
use
of
some
of
the
oakum
which
we
had
with
us
binding
this
on
with
strips
torn
from
the
roll
of
spare
duck
which
had
been
in
the
locker
of
the
boat
for
my
part
seizing
this
chance
to
make
some
examination
of
my
wounded
toe
the
which
indeed
was
causing
me
to
limp
i
found
that
i
had
endured
less
harm
than
seemed
to
me
for
the
bone
of
the
toe
was
untouched
though
showing
bare
yet
when
it
was
cleansed
i
had
not
overmuch
pain
with
it
though
i
could
not
suffer
to
have
the
boot
on
and
so
bound
some
canvas
about
my
foot
until
such
time
as
it
should
be
healed
presently
when
our
wounds
were
all
attended
to
the
which
had
taken
time
for
there
was
none
of
us
altogether
untouched
the
bade
the
man
whose
fingers
were
damaged
to
lie
down
in
the
tent
and
the
same
order
he
gave
also
to
him
that
was
bitten
in
the
arm
then
the
rest
of
us
he
directed
to
go
down
with
him
and
carry
up
fuel
for
that
the
night
had
shown
him
how
our
very
lives
depended
upon
a
sufficiency
of
this
and
so
all
that
morning
we
brought
fuel
to
the
both
weed
and
reeds
resting
not
until
midday
when
he
gave
us
a
further
tot
of
the
rum
and
after
that
set
one
of
the
men
upon
the
dinner
then
he
bade
the
man
jessop
by
name
who
had
proposed
to
fly
a
kite
over
the
vessel
in
the
weed
to
say
whether
he
had
any
craft
in
the
making
of
such
a
matter
at
that
the
fellow
laughed
and
told
the
that
he
would
make
him
a
kite
that
would
fly
very
steadily
and
strongly
and
this
without
the
aid
of
a
tail
and
so
the
bade
him
without
delay
for
that
we
should
do
well
to
deliver
the
people
in
the
hulk
and
afterwards
make
all
haste
from
the
island
which
was
no
better
than
a
nesting
place
of
ghouls
now
hearing
the
man
say
that
his
kite
would
fly
without
a
tail
i
was
mightily
curious
to
see
what
manner
of
thing
he
would
make
for
i
had
never
seen
the
like
nor
heard
that
such
was
possible
yet
he
spoke
of
no
more
than
he
could
accomplish
for
he
took
two
of
the
reeds
and
cut
them
to
a
length
of
about
six
feet
then
he
bound
them
together
in
the
middle
so
that
they
formed
a
saint
andrew
cross
and
after
that
he
made
two
more
such
crosses
and
when
these
were
completed
he
took
four
reeds
maybe
a
dozen
feet
long
and
bade
us
stand
them
upright
in
the
shape
of
a
square
so
that
they
formed
the
four
corners
and
after
that
he
took
one
of
the
crosses
and
laid
it
in
the
square
so
that
its
four
ends
touched
the
four
uprights
and
in
this
position
he
lashed
it
then
he
took
the
second
cross
and
lashed
it
midway
between
the
top
and
bottom
of
the
uprights
and
after
that
he
lashed
the
third
at
the
top
so
that
the
three
of
them
acted
as
spreaders
to
keep
the
four
longer
reeds
in
their
places
as
though
they
were
for
the
uprights
of
a
little
square
tower
now
when
he
had
gotten
so
far
as
that
the
called
out
to
us
to
make
our
dinners
and
this
we
did
and
afterwards
had
a
short
time
in
which
to
smoke
and
whilst
we
were
thus
at
our
ease
the
sun
came
out
the
which
it
had
not
done
all
the
day
and
at
that
we
felt
vastly
brighter
for
the
day
had
been
very
gloomy
with
clouds
until
that
time
and
what
with
the
loss
of
tompkins
and
our
own
fears
and
hurts
we
had
been
exceeding
doleful
but
now
as
i
have
said
we
became
more
cheerful
and
went
very
alertly
to
the
finishing
of
the
kite
at
this
point
it
came
suddenly
to
the
that
we
had
made
no
provision
of
cord
for
the
flying
of
the
kite
and
he
called
out
to
the
man
to
know
what
strength
the
kite
would
require
at
which
jessop
answered
him
that
maybe
sennit
would
do
and
this
being
so
the
led
three
of
us
down
to
the
wrecked
mast
upon
the
further
beach
and
from
this
we
stripped
all
that
was
left
of
the
shrouds
and
carried
them
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
so
presently
having
unlaid
them
we
upon
the
sennit
using
ten
yarns
but
plaiting
two
as
one
by
which
means
we
progressed
with
more
speed
than
if
we
had
taken
them
singly
now
as
we
worked
i
glanced
occasionally
towards
jessop
and
saw
that
he
stitched
a
band
of
the
light
duck
around
each
end
of
the
framework
which
he
had
made
and
these
bands
i
judged
to
be
about
four
feet
wide
in
this
wise
leaving
an
open
space
between
the
two
so
that
now
the
thing
looked
something
like
to
a
punchinello
show
only
that
the
opening
was
in
the
wrong
place
and
there
was
too
much
of
it
after
that
he
bent
on
a
bridle
to
two
of
the
uprights
making
this
of
a
piece
of
good
hemp
rope
which
he
found
in
the
tent
and
then
he
called
out
to
the
that
the
kite
was
finished
at
that
the
went
over
to
examine
it
the
which
did
all
of
us
for
none
of
us
had
seen
the
like
of
such
a
thing
and
if
i
misdoubt
not
few
of
us
had
much
faith
that
it
would
fly
for
it
seemed
so
big
and
unwieldy
now
i
think
that
jessop
gathered
something
of
our
thoughts
for
calling
to
one
of
us
to
hold
the
kite
lest
it
should
blow
away
he
went
into
the
tent
and
brought
out
the
remainder
of
the
hemp
line
the
same
from
which
he
had
cut
the
bridle
this
he
bent
on
to
it
and
giving
the
end
into
our
hands
bade
us
go
back
with
it
until
all
the
slack
was
taken
up
he
in
the
meanwhile
steadying
the
kite
then
when
we
had
gone
back
to
the
extent
of
the
line
he
shouted
to
us
to
take
a
very
particular
hold
upon
it
and
then
stooping
caught
the
kite
by
the
bottom
and
threw
it
into
the
air
whereupon
to
our
amazement
having
swooped
somewhat
to
one
side
it
steadied
and
mounted
upwards
into
the
sky
like
a
very
bird
now
at
this
as
i
have
made
mention
we
were
astonished
for
it
appeared
like
a
miracle
to
us
to
see
so
cumbrous
a
thing
fly
with
so
much
grace
and
persistence
and
further
we
were
mightily
surprised
at
the
manner
in
which
it
pulled
upon
the
rope
tugging
with
such
heartiness
that
we
were
like
to
have
loosed
it
in
our
first
astonishment
had
it
not
been
for
the
warning
which
jessop
called
to
us
and
now
being
well
assured
of
the
properness
of
the
kite
the
bade
us
to
draw
it
in
the
which
we
did
only
with
difficulty
because
of
its
bigness
and
the
strength
of
the
breeze
and
when
we
had
it
back
again
upon
the
hilltop
jessop
moored
it
very
securely
to
a
great
piece
of
rock
and
after
that
having
received
our
approbation
he
with
us
upon
the
making
of
the
sennit
presently
the
evening
drawing
near
the
set
us
to
the
building
of
fires
about
the
and
after
that
having
waved
our
goodnights
to
the
people
in
the
hulk
we
made
our
suppers
and
lay
down
to
smoke
after
which
we
again
at
our
plaiting
of
the
sennit
the
which
we
were
in
very
great
haste
to
have
done
and
so
later
the
dark
having
come
down
upon
the
island
the
bade
us
take
burning
weed
from
the
center
fire
and
set
light
to
the
heaps
of
weed
that
we
had
stacked
round
the
edges
of
the
hill
for
that
purpose
and
so
in
a
few
minutes
the
whole
of
the
was
very
light
and
cheerful
and
afterwards
having
put
two
of
the
men
to
keep
watch
and
attend
to
the
fires
he
sent
the
rest
of
us
back
to
our
sennit
making
keeping
us
at
it
until
maybe
about
ten
of
the
clock
after
which
he
arranged
that
two
men
at
a
time
should
be
on
watch
throughout
the
night
and
then
he
bade
the
rest
of
us
so
soon
as
he
had
looked
to
our
various
hurts
now
when
it
came
to
my
turn
to
watch
i
discovered
that
i
had
been
chosen
to
accompany
the
big
seaman
at
which
i
was
by
no
means
displeased
for
he
was
a
most
excellent
fellow
and
moreover
a
very
lusty
man
to
have
near
should
anything
come
upon
one
unawares
yet
we
were
happy
in
that
the
night
passed
off
without
trouble
of
any
sort
and
so
at
last
came
the
morning
so
soon
as
we
had
made
our
breakfast
the
took
us
all
down
to
the
carrying
of
fuel
for
he
saw
very
clearly
that
upon
a
good
supply
of
this
depended
our
immunity
from
attack
and
so
for
the
half
of
the
morning
we
worked
at
the
gathering
of
weed
and
reeds
for
our
fires
then
when
we
had
obtained
a
sufficiency
for
the
coming
night
he
set
us
all
to
work
again
upon
the
sennit
and
so
until
dinner
after
which
we
once
more
upon
our
plaiting
yet
it
was
plain
that
it
would
take
several
days
to
make
a
sufficient
line
for
our
purpose
and
because
of
this
the
cast
about
in
his
mind
for
some
way
in
which
he
could
quicken
its
production
presently
as
a
result
of
some
little
thought
he
brought
out
from
the
tent
the
long
piece
of
hemp
rope
with
which
we
had
moored
the
boat
to
the
sea
anchor
and
proceeded
to
unlay
it
until
he
had
all
three
strands
separate
then
he
bent
the
three
together
and
so
had
a
very
rough
line
of
maybe
some
hundred
and
eighty
fathoms
in
length
yet
though
so
rough
he
judged
it
strong
enough
and
thus
we
had
this
much
the
less
sennit
to
make
now
presently
we
made
our
dinner
and
after
that
for
the
rest
of
the
day
we
kept
very
steadily
to
our
plaiting
and
so
with
the
previous
day
work
had
near
two
hundred
fathoms
completed
by
the
time
that
the
called
us
to
cease
and
come
to
supper
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
counting
all
including
the
piece
of
hemp
line
from
which
the
bridle
had
been
made
we
may
be
said
to
have
had
at
this
time
about
four
hundred
fathoms
towards
the
length
which
we
needed
for
our
purpose
this
having
been
reckoned
at
five
hundred
fathoms
after
supper
having
lit
all
the
fires
we
continued
to
work
at
the
plaiting
and
so
until
the
set
the
watches
after
which
we
settled
down
for
the
night
first
however
letting
the
see
to
our
hurts
now
this
night
like
to
the
previous
brought
us
no
trouble
and
when
the
day
came
we
had
first
our
breakfast
and
then
upon
our
collecting
of
fuel
after
which
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
at
the
sennit
having
manufactured
a
sufficiency
by
the
evening
the
which
the
celebrated
by
a
very
rousing
tot
of
the
rum
then
having
made
our
supper
we
lit
the
fires
and
had
a
very
comfortable
evening
after
which
as
on
the
preceding
nights
having
let
the
attend
our
wounds
we
settled
for
the
night
and
on
this
occasion
the
let
the
man
who
had
lost
his
fingers
and
the
one
who
had
been
bitten
so
badly
in
the
arm
take
their
first
turn
at
the
watching
since
the
night
of
the
attack
now
when
the
morning
came
we
were
all
of
us
very
eager
to
come
to
the
flying
of
the
kite
for
it
seemed
possible
to
us
that
we
might
effect
the
rescue
of
the
people
in
the
hulk
before
the
evening
and
at
the
thought
of
this
we
experienced
a
very
pleasurable
sense
of
excitement
yet
before
the
would
let
us
touch
the
kite
he
insisted
that
we
should
gather
our
usual
supply
of
fuel
the
which
order
though
full
of
wisdom
irked
us
exceedingly
because
of
our
eagerness
to
set
about
the
rescue
but
at
last
this
was
accomplished
and
we
made
to
get
the
line
ready
testing
the
knots
and
seeing
that
it
was
all
clear
for
running
yet
before
setting
the
kite
off
the
took
us
down
to
the
further
beach
to
bring
up
the
foot
of
the
royal
and
mast
which
remained
fast
to
the
topmast
and
when
we
had
this
upon
the
he
set
its
ends
upon
two
rocks
after
which
he
piled
a
heap
of
great
pieces
around
them
leaving
the
middle
part
clear
round
this
he
passed
the
kite
line
a
couple
or
three
times
and
then
gave
the
end
to
jessop
to
bend
on
to
the
bridle
of
the
kite
and
so
he
had
all
ready
for
paying
out
to
the
wreck
and
now
having
nothing
to
do
we
gathered
round
to
watch
and
immediately
the
giving
the
signal
jessop
cast
the
kite
into
the
air
and
the
wind
catching
it
lifted
it
strongly
and
well
so
that
the
could
scarce
pay
out
fast
enough
now
before
the
kite
had
been
let
go
jessop
had
bent
to
the
forward
end
of
it
a
great
length
of
the
spun
yarn
so
that
those
in
the
wreck
could
catch
it
as
it
trailed
over
them
and
being
eager
to
witness
whether
they
would
secure
it
without
trouble
we
ran
all
of
us
to
the
edge
of
the
hill
to
watch
thus
within
five
minutes
from
the
time
of
the
loosing
of
the
kite
we
saw
the
people
in
the
ship
wave
to
us
to
cease
veering
and
immediately
afterwards
the
kite
came
swiftly
downwards
by
which
we
knew
that
they
had
the
and
were
hauling
upon
it
and
at
that
we
gave
out
a
great
cheer
and
afterwards
we
sat
about
and
smoked
waiting
until
they
had
read
our
instructions
which
we
had
written
upon
the
covering
of
the
kite
presently
maybe
the
half
of
an
hour
afterwards
they
signaled
to
us
to
haul
upon
our
line
which
we
proceeded
to
do
without
delay
and
so
after
a
great
space
we
had
hauled
in
all
of
our
rough
line
and
come
upon
the
end
of
theirs
which
proved
to
be
a
fine
piece
of
hemp
new
and
very
good
yet
we
could
not
conceive
that
this
would
stand
the
stress
necessary
to
lift
so
great
a
length
clear
of
the
weed
as
would
be
needful
or
ever
we
could
hope
to
bring
the
people
of
the
ship
over
it
in
safety
and
so
we
waited
some
little
while
and
presently
they
signaled
again
to
us
to
haul
which
we
did
and
found
that
they
had
bent
on
a
much
greater
rope
to
the
bight
of
the
hemp
having
merely
intended
the
latter
for
a
by
which
to
get
the
heavier
rope
across
the
weed
to
the
island
thus
after
a
weariful
time
of
pulling
we
got
the
end
of
the
bigger
rope
up
to
the
and
discovered
it
to
be
an
extraordinarily
sound
rope
of
some
four
inches
diameter
and
smoothly
laid
of
fine
yarns
round
and
very
true
and
well
spun
and
with
this
we
had
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
now
to
the
end
of
the
big
rope
they
had
tied
a
letter
in
a
bag
of
oilskin
and
in
it
they
said
some
very
warm
and
grateful
things
to
us
after
which
they
set
out
a
short
code
of
signals
by
which
we
should
be
able
to
understand
one
another
on
certain
general
matters
and
at
the
end
they
asked
if
they
should
send
us
any
provision
ashore
for
as
they
explained
it
would
take
some
little
while
to
get
the
rope
set
taut
enough
for
our
purpose
and
the
carrier
fixed
and
in
working
order
now
upon
reading
this
letter
we
called
out
to
the
that
he
should
ask
them
if
they
would
send
us
some
soft
bread
the
which
he
added
thereto
a
request
for
lint
and
bandages
and
ointment
for
our
hurts
and
this
he
bade
me
write
upon
one
of
the
great
leaves
from
off
the
reeds
and
at
the
end
he
told
me
to
ask
if
they
desired
us
to
send
them
any
fresh
water
and
all
of
this
i
wrote
with
a
sharpened
splinter
of
reed
cutting
the
words
into
the
surface
of
the
leaf
then
when
i
had
made
an
end
of
writing
i
gave
the
leaf
to
the
and
he
enclosed
it
in
the
oilskin
bag
after
which
he
gave
the
signal
for
those
in
the
hulk
to
haul
on
the
smaller
line
and
this
they
did
presently
they
signed
to
us
to
pull
in
again
the
which
we
did
and
so
when
we
had
hauled
in
a
great
length
of
their
line
we
came
to
the
little
oilskin
bag
in
which
we
found
lint
and
bandages
and
ointment
and
a
further
letter
which
set
out
that
they
were
baking
bread
and
would
send
us
some
so
soon
as
it
was
out
from
the
oven
now
in
addition
to
the
matters
for
the
healing
of
our
wounds
and
the
letter
they
had
included
a
bundle
of
paper
in
loose
sheets
some
quills
and
an
inkhorn
and
at
the
end
of
their
epistle
they
begged
very
earnestly
of
us
to
send
them
some
news
of
the
outer
world
for
they
had
been
shut
up
in
that
strange
continent
of
weed
for
something
over
seven
years
they
told
us
then
that
there
were
twelve
of
them
in
the
hulk
three
of
them
being
women
one
of
whom
had
been
the
captain
wife
but
he
had
died
soon
after
the
vessel
became
entangled
in
the
weed
and
along
with
him
more
than
half
of
the
ship
company
having
been
attacked
by
giant
as
they
were
attempting
to
free
the
vessel
from
the
weed
and
afterwards
they
who
were
left
had
built
the
superstructure
as
a
protection
against
the
and
the
as
they
termed
them
for
until
it
had
been
built
there
had
been
no
safety
about
the
decks
neither
day
nor
night
to
our
question
as
to
whether
they
were
in
need
of
water
the
people
in
the
ship
replied
that
they
had
a
sufficiency
and
further
that
they
were
very
well
supplied
with
provisions
for
the
ship
had
sailed
from
london
with
a
general
cargo
among
which
there
was
a
vast
quantity
of
food
in
various
shapes
and
forms
at
this
news
we
were
greatly
pleased
seeing
that
we
need
have
no
more
anxiety
regarding
a
lack
of
victuals
and
so
in
the
letter
which
i
went
into
the
tent
to
write
i
put
down
that
we
were
in
no
great
plentitude
of
provisions
at
which
hint
i
guessed
they
would
add
somewhat
to
the
bread
when
it
should
be
ready
and
after
that
i
wrote
down
such
chief
events
as
my
memory
recalled
as
having
occurred
in
the
course
of
the
past
seven
years
and
then
a
short
account
of
our
own
adventures
up
to
that
time
telling
them
of
the
attack
which
we
had
suffered
from
the
weed
men
and
asking
such
questions
as
my
curiosity
and
wonder
prompted
now
whilst
i
had
been
writing
sitting
in
the
mouth
of
the
tent
i
had
observed
from
time
to
time
how
that
the
was
busied
with
the
men
in
passing
the
end
of
the
big
rope
round
a
mighty
boulder
which
lay
about
ten
fathoms
in
from
the
edge
of
the
cliff
which
overlooked
the
hulk
this
he
did
parceling
the
rope
where
the
rock
was
in
any
way
sharp
so
as
to
protect
it
from
being
cut
for
which
purpose
he
made
use
of
some
of
the
canvas
and
by
the
time
that
i
had
the
letter
completed
the
rope
was
made
very
secure
to
the
great
piece
of
rock
and
further
they
had
put
a
large
piece
of
chafing
gear
under
that
part
of
the
rope
where
it
took
the
edge
of
the
cliff
now
having
as
i
have
said
completed
the
letter
i
went
out
with
it
to
the
but
before
placing
it
in
the
oilskin
bag
he
bade
me
add
a
note
at
the
bottom
to
say
that
the
big
rope
was
all
fast
and
that
they
could
heave
on
it
so
soon
as
it
pleased
them
and
after
that
we
dispatched
the
letter
by
means
of
the
small
line
the
men
in
the
hulk
hauling
it
off
to
them
so
soon
as
they
perceived
our
signals
by
this
it
had
come
well
on
to
the
latter
part
of
the
afternoon
and
the
called
us
to
make
some
sort
of
a
meal
leaving
one
man
to
watch
the
hulk
perchance
they
should
signal
to
us
for
we
had
missed
our
dinner
in
the
excitement
of
the
day
work
and
were
come
now
to
feel
the
lack
of
it
then
in
the
midst
of
it
the
man
upon
the
lookout
cried
out
that
they
were
signaling
to
us
from
the
ship
and
at
that
we
ran
all
of
us
to
see
what
they
desired
and
so
by
the
code
which
we
had
arranged
between
us
we
found
that
they
waited
for
us
to
haul
upon
the
small
line
this
did
we
and
made
out
presently
that
we
were
hauling
something
across
the
weed
of
a
very
fair
bulk
at
which
we
warmed
to
our
work
guessing
that
it
was
the
bread
which
they
had
promised
us
and
so
it
proved
and
done
up
with
great
neatness
in
a
long
roll
of
tarpaulin
which
had
been
wrapped
around
both
the
loaves
and
the
rope
and
lashed
very
securely
at
the
ends
thus
producing
a
taper
shape
convenient
for
passing
over
the
weed
without
catching
now
when
we
came
to
open
this
parcel
we
discovered
that
my
hint
had
taken
very
sound
effect
for
there
were
in
the
parcel
besides
the
loaves
a
boiled
ham
a
dutch
cheese
two
bottles
of
port
well
padded
from
breakage
and
four
pounds
of
tobacco
in
plugs
and
at
this
coming
of
good
things
we
stood
all
of
us
upon
the
edge
of
the
hill
and
waved
our
thanks
to
those
in
the
ship
they
waving
back
in
all
good
will
and
after
that
we
went
back
to
our
meal
at
which
we
sampled
the
new
victuals
with
very
lusty
appetites
there
was
in
the
parcel
one
other
matter
a
letter
most
neatly
indited
as
had
been
the
former
epistles
in
a
feminine
handwriting
so
that
i
guessed
they
had
one
of
the
women
to
be
their
scribe
this
epistle
answered
some
of
my
queries
and
in
particular
i
remember
that
it
informed
me
as
to
the
probable
cause
of
the
strange
crying
which
preceded
the
attack
by
the
weed
men
saying
that
on
each
occasion
when
they
in
the
ship
had
suffered
their
attacks
there
had
been
always
this
same
crying
being
evidently
a
summoning
call
or
signal
to
the
attack
though
how
given
the
writer
had
not
discovered
for
the
weed
this
being
how
they
in
the
ship
spoke
always
of
them
made
never
a
sound
when
attacking
not
even
when
wounded
to
the
death
and
indeed
i
may
say
here
that
we
never
learnt
the
way
in
which
that
lonesome
sobbing
was
produced
nor
indeed
did
they
or
we
discover
more
than
the
merest
tithe
of
the
mysteries
which
that
great
continent
of
weed
holds
in
its
silence
another
matter
to
which
i
had
referred
was
the
consistent
blowing
of
the
wind
from
one
quarter
and
this
the
writer
told
me
happened
for
as
much
as
six
months
in
the
year
keeping
up
a
very
steady
strength
a
further
thing
there
was
which
gave
me
much
interest
it
was
that
the
ship
had
not
been
always
where
we
had
discovered
her
for
at
one
time
they
had
been
so
far
within
the
weed
that
they
could
scarce
discern
the
open
sea
upon
the
far
horizon
but
that
at
times
the
weed
opened
in
great
gulfs
that
went
yawning
through
the
continent
for
scores
of
miles
and
in
this
way
the
shape
and
coasts
of
the
weed
were
being
constantly
altered
these
happenings
being
for
the
most
part
at
the
change
of
the
wind
and
much
more
there
was
that
they
told
us
then
and
afterwards
how
that
they
dried
weed
for
their
fuel
and
how
the
rains
which
fell
with
great
heaviness
at
certain
periods
supplied
them
with
fresh
water
though
at
times
running
short
they
had
learnt
to
distil
sufficient
for
their
needs
until
the
next
rains
now
near
to
the
end
of
the
epistle
there
came
some
news
of
their
present
actions
and
thus
we
learnt
that
they
in
the
ship
were
busy
at
staying
the
stump
of
the
this
being
the
one
to
which
they
proposed
to
attach
the
big
rope
taking
it
through
a
great
secured
to
the
head
of
the
stump
and
then
down
to
the
by
which
and
a
strong
tackle
they
would
be
able
to
heave
the
line
so
taut
as
was
needful
now
having
finished
our
meal
the
took
out
the
lint
bandages
and
ointment
which
they
had
sent
us
from
the
hulk
and
proceeded
to
dress
our
hurts
beginning
with
him
who
had
lost
his
fingers
which
happily
were
making
a
very
healthy
heal
and
afterwards
we
went
all
of
us
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
sent
back
the
to
fill
such
crevices
in
his
stomach
as
remained
yet
empty
for
we
had
passed
him
already
some
sound
hunks
of
the
bread
and
ham
and
cheese
to
eat
whilst
he
kept
watch
and
so
he
had
suffered
no
great
harm
it
may
have
been
near
an
hour
after
this
that
the
pointed
out
to
me
that
they
in
the
ship
had
commenced
to
heave
upon
the
great
rope
and
so
i
perceived
and
stood
watching
it
for
i
knew
that
the
had
some
anxiety
as
to
whether
it
would
sufficiently
clear
of
the
weed
to
allow
those
in
the
ship
to
be
hauled
along
it
free
from
molestation
by
the
great
presently
as
the
evening
began
to
draw
on
the
bade
us
go
and
build
our
fires
about
the
hilltop
and
this
we
did
after
which
we
returned
to
learn
how
the
rope
was
lifting
and
now
we
perceived
that
it
had
come
clear
of
the
weed
at
which
we
felt
mightily
rejoiced
and
waved
encouragement
chance
there
might
be
any
who
watched
us
from
the
hulk
yet
though
the
rope
was
up
clear
of
the
weed
the
bight
of
it
had
to
rise
to
a
much
greater
height
or
ever
it
would
do
for
the
purpose
for
which
we
intended
it
and
already
it
suffered
a
vast
strain
as
i
discovered
by
placing
my
hand
upon
it
for
even
to
lift
the
slack
of
so
great
a
length
of
line
meant
the
stress
of
some
tons
and
later
i
saw
that
the
was
growing
anxious
for
he
went
over
to
the
rock
around
which
he
had
made
fast
the
rope
and
examined
the
knots
and
those
places
where
he
had
parceled
it
and
after
that
he
walked
to
the
place
where
it
went
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
here
he
made
a
further
scrutiny
but
came
back
presently
seeming
not
dissatisfied
then
in
a
while
the
darkness
came
down
upon
us
and
we
lighted
our
fires
and
prepared
for
the
night
having
the
watches
arranged
as
on
the
preceding
nights
xv
aboard
the
hulk
now
when
it
came
to
my
watch
the
which
i
took
in
company
with
the
big
seaman
the
moon
had
not
yet
risen
and
all
the
island
was
vastly
dark
save
the
from
which
the
fires
blazed
in
a
score
of
places
and
very
busy
they
kept
us
supplying
them
with
fuel
then
when
maybe
the
half
of
our
watch
had
passed
the
big
seaman
who
had
been
to
feed
the
fires
upon
the
weed
side
of
the
came
across
to
me
and
bade
me
come
and
put
my
hand
upon
the
lesser
rope
for
that
he
thought
they
in
the
ship
were
anxious
to
haul
it
in
so
that
they
might
send
some
message
across
to
us
at
his
words
i
asked
him
very
anxiously
whether
he
had
perceived
them
waving
a
light
the
which
we
had
arranged
to
be
our
method
of
signaling
in
the
night
in
the
event
of
such
being
needful
but
to
this
he
said
that
he
had
seen
naught
and
by
now
having
come
near
the
edge
of
the
cliff
i
could
see
for
myself
and
so
perceived
that
there
was
none
signaling
to
us
from
the
hulk
yet
to
please
the
fellow
i
put
my
hand
upon
the
line
which
we
had
made
fast
in
the
evening
to
a
large
piece
of
rock
and
so
immediately
i
discovered
that
something
was
pulling
upon
it
hauling
and
then
slackening
so
that
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
people
in
the
vessel
might
be
indeed
wishful
to
send
us
some
message
and
at
that
to
make
sure
i
ran
to
the
nearest
fire
and
lighting
a
tuft
of
weed
waved
it
thrice
but
there
came
not
any
answering
signal
from
those
in
the
ship
and
at
that
i
went
back
to
feel
at
the
rope
to
assure
myself
that
it
had
not
been
the
pluck
of
the
wind
upon
it
but
i
found
that
it
was
something
very
different
from
the
wind
something
that
plucked
with
all
the
sharpness
of
a
hooked
fish
only
that
it
had
been
a
mighty
great
fish
to
have
given
such
tugs
and
so
i
knew
that
some
vile
thing
out
in
the
darkness
of
the
weed
was
fast
to
the
rope
and
at
this
there
came
the
fear
that
it
might
break
it
and
then
a
second
thought
that
something
might
be
climbing
up
to
us
along
the
rope
and
so
i
bade
the
big
seaman
stand
ready
with
his
great
cutlass
whilst
i
ran
and
waked
the
and
this
i
did
and
explained
to
him
how
that
something
meddled
with
the
lesser
rope
so
that
he
came
immediately
to
see
for
himself
how
this
might
be
and
when
he
had
put
his
hand
upon
it
he
bade
me
go
and
call
the
rest
of
the
men
and
let
them
stand
round
by
the
fires
for
that
there
was
something
abroad
in
the
night
and
we
might
be
in
danger
of
attack
but
he
and
the
big
seaman
stayed
by
the
end
of
the
rope
watching
so
far
as
the
darkness
would
allow
and
ever
and
anon
feeling
the
tension
upon
it
then
suddenly
it
came
to
the
to
look
to
the
second
line
and
he
ran
cursing
himself
for
his
thoughtlessness
but
because
of
its
greater
weight
and
tension
he
could
not
discover
for
certain
whether
anything
meddled
with
it
or
not
yet
he
stayed
by
it
arguing
that
if
aught
touched
the
smaller
rope
then
might
something
do
likewise
with
the
greater
only
that
the
small
line
lay
along
the
weed
whilst
the
greater
one
had
been
some
feet
above
it
when
the
darkness
had
fallen
over
us
and
so
might
be
free
from
any
prowling
creatures
and
thus
maybe
an
hour
passed
and
we
kept
watch
and
tended
the
fires
going
from
one
to
another
and
presently
coming
to
that
one
which
was
nearest
to
the
i
went
over
to
him
intending
to
pass
a
few
minutes
in
talk
but
as
i
drew
nigh
to
him
i
chanced
to
place
my
hand
upon
the
big
rope
and
at
that
i
exclaimed
in
surprise
for
it
had
become
much
slacker
than
when
last
i
had
felt
it
in
the
evening
and
i
asked
the
whether
he
had
noticed
it
whereat
he
felt
the
rope
and
was
almost
more
amazed
than
i
had
been
for
when
last
he
had
touched
it
it
had
been
taut
and
humming
in
the
wind
now
upon
this
discovery
he
was
in
much
fear
that
something
had
bitten
through
it
and
called
to
the
men
to
come
all
of
them
and
pull
upon
the
rope
so
that
he
might
discover
whether
it
was
indeed
parted
but
when
they
came
and
hauled
upon
it
they
were
unable
to
gather
in
any
of
it
whereat
we
felt
all
of
us
mightily
relieved
in
our
minds
though
still
unable
to
come
at
the
cause
of
its
sudden
slackness
and
so
a
while
later
there
rose
the
moon
and
we
were
able
to
examine
the
island
and
the
water
between
it
and
the
to
see
whether
there
was
anything
stirring
yet
neither
in
the
valley
nor
on
the
faces
of
the
cliffs
nor
in
the
open
water
could
we
perceive
aught
living
and
as
for
anything
among
the
weed
it
was
small
use
trying
to
discover
it
among
all
that
shaggy
blackness
and
now
being
assured
that
nothing
was
coming
at
us
and
that
so
far
as
our
eyes
could
pierce
there
climbed
nothing
upon
the
ropes
the
bade
us
get
all
except
those
whose
time
it
was
to
watch
yet
before
i
went
into
the
tent
i
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
big
rope
the
which
did
also
the
but
could
perceive
no
cause
for
its
slackness
though
this
was
quite
apparent
in
the
moonlight
the
rope
going
down
with
greater
abruptness
than
it
had
done
in
the
evening
and
so
we
could
but
conceive
that
they
in
the
hulk
had
slacked
it
for
some
reason
and
after
that
we
went
to
the
tent
and
a
further
spell
of
sleep
in
the
early
morning
we
were
waked
by
one
of
the
watchmen
coming
into
the
tent
to
call
the
for
it
appeared
that
the
hulk
had
moved
in
the
night
so
that
its
stern
was
now
pointed
somewhat
towards
the
island
at
this
news
we
ran
all
of
us
from
the
tent
to
the
edge
of
the
hill
and
found
it
to
be
indeed
as
the
man
had
said
and
now
i
understood
the
reason
of
that
sudden
slackening
of
the
rope
for
after
withstanding
the
stress
upon
it
for
some
hours
the
vessel
had
at
last
yielded
and
slewed
its
stern
towards
us
moving
also
to
some
extent
bodily
in
our
direction
and
now
we
discovered
that
a
man
in
the
place
in
the
top
of
the
structure
was
waving
a
welcome
to
us
at
which
we
waved
back
and
then
the
bade
me
haste
and
write
a
note
to
know
whether
it
seemed
to
them
likely
that
they
might
be
able
to
heave
the
ship
clear
of
the
weed
and
this
i
did
greatly
excited
within
myself
at
this
new
thought
as
indeed
was
the
himself
and
the
rest
of
the
men
for
could
they
do
this
then
how
easily
solved
were
every
problem
of
coming
to
our
own
country
but
it
seemed
too
good
a
thing
to
have
come
true
and
yet
i
could
but
hope
and
so
when
my
letter
was
completed
we
put
it
up
in
the
little
oilskin
bag
and
signaled
to
those
in
the
ship
to
haul
in
upon
the
line
yet
when
they
went
to
haul
there
came
a
mighty
splather
amid
the
weed
and
they
seemed
unable
to
gather
in
any
of
the
slack
and
then
after
a
certain
pause
i
saw
the
man
in
the
point
something
and
immediately
afterwards
there
belched
out
in
front
of
him
a
little
puff
of
smoke
and
presently
i
caught
the
report
of
a
musket
so
that
i
knew
that
he
was
firing
at
something
in
the
weed
he
fired
again
and
yet
once
more
and
after
that
they
were
able
to
haul
in
upon
the
line
and
so
i
perceived
that
his
fire
had
proved
effectual
yet
we
had
no
knowledge
of
the
thing
at
which
he
had
discharged
his
weapon
now
presently
they
signaled
to
us
to
draw
back
the
line
the
which
we
could
do
only
with
great
difficulty
and
then
the
man
in
the
top
of
the
signed
to
us
to
vast
hauling
which
we
did
whereupon
he
began
to
fire
again
into
the
weed
though
with
what
effect
we
could
not
perceive
then
in
a
while
he
signaled
to
us
to
haul
again
and
now
the
rope
came
more
easily
yet
still
with
much
labor
and
a
commotion
in
the
weed
over
which
it
lay
and
in
places
sank
and
so
at
last
as
it
cleared
the
weed
because
of
the
lift
of
the
cliff
we
saw
that
a
great
crab
had
clutched
it
and
that
we
hauled
it
towards
us
for
the
creature
had
too
much
obstinacy
to
let
go
perceiving
this
and
fearing
that
the
great
claws
of
the
crab
might
divide
the
rope
the
caught
up
one
of
the
men
lances
and
ran
to
the
cliff
edge
calling
to
us
to
pull
in
gently
and
put
no
more
strain
upon
the
line
than
need
be
and
so
hauling
with
great
steadiness
we
brought
the
monster
near
to
the
edge
of
the
hill
and
there
at
a
wave
from
the
stayed
our
pulling
then
he
raised
the
spear
and
smote
at
the
creature
eyes
as
he
had
done
on
a
previous
occasion
and
immediately
it
loosed
its
hold
and
fell
with
a
mighty
splash
into
the
water
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
then
the
bade
us
haul
in
the
rest
of
the
rope
until
we
should
come
to
the
packet
and
in
the
meantime
he
examined
the
line
to
see
whether
it
had
suffered
harm
through
the
mandibles
of
the
crab
yet
beyond
a
little
chafe
it
was
quite
sound
and
so
we
came
to
the
letter
which
i
opened
and
read
finding
it
to
be
written
in
the
same
feminine
hand
which
had
indited
the
others
from
it
we
gathered
that
the
ship
had
burst
through
a
very
thick
mass
of
the
weed
which
had
compacted
itself
about
her
and
that
the
second
mate
who
was
the
only
officer
remaining
to
them
thought
there
might
be
good
chance
to
heave
the
vessel
out
though
it
would
have
to
be
done
with
great
slowness
so
as
to
allow
the
weed
to
part
gradually
otherwise
the
ship
would
but
act
as
a
gigantic
rake
to
gather
up
weed
before
it
and
so
form
its
own
barrier
to
clear
water
and
after
this
there
were
kind
wishes
and
hopes
that
we
had
spent
a
good
night
the
which
i
took
to
be
prompted
by
the
feminine
heart
of
the
writer
and
after
that
i
fell
to
wondering
whether
it
was
the
captain
wife
who
acted
as
scribe
then
i
was
waked
from
my
pondering
by
one
of
the
men
crying
out
that
they
in
the
ship
had
commenced
to
heave
again
upon
the
big
rope
and
for
a
time
i
stood
and
watched
it
rise
slowly
as
it
came
to
tautness
i
had
stood
there
awhile
watching
the
rope
when
suddenly
there
came
a
commotion
amid
the
weed
about
of
the
way
to
the
ship
and
now
i
saw
that
the
rope
had
freed
itself
from
the
weed
and
clutching
it
were
maybe
a
score
of
giant
crabs
at
this
sight
some
of
the
men
cried
out
their
astonishment
and
then
we
saw
that
there
had
come
a
number
of
men
into
the
place
in
the
top
of
the
superstructure
and
immediately
they
opened
a
very
brisk
fire
upon
the
creatures
and
so
by
ones
and
twos
they
fell
back
into
the
weed
and
after
that
the
men
in
the
hulk
resumed
their
heaving
and
so
in
a
while
had
the
rope
some
feet
clear
of
the
surface
now
having
tautened
the
rope
so
much
as
they
thought
proper
they
left
it
to
have
its
due
effect
upon
the
ship
and
proceeded
to
attach
a
great
block
to
it
then
they
signaled
to
us
to
slack
away
on
the
little
rope
until
they
had
the
middle
part
of
it
and
this
they
hitched
around
the
neck
of
the
block
and
to
the
eye
in
the
strop
of
the
block
they
attached
a
chair
and
so
they
had
ready
a
carrier
and
by
this
means
we
were
able
to
haul
stuff
to
and
from
the
hulk
without
having
to
drag
it
across
the
surface
of
the
weed
being
indeed
the
fashion
in
which
we
had
intended
to
haul
ashore
the
people
in
the
ship
but
now
we
had
the
bigger
project
of
salvaging
the
ship
herself
and
further
the
big
rope
which
acted
as
support
for
the
carrier
was
not
yet
of
a
sufficient
height
above
the
for
it
to
be
safe
to
attempt
to
bring
any
ashore
by
such
means
and
now
that
we
had
hopes
of
saving
the
ship
we
did
not
intend
to
risk
parting
the
big
rope
by
trying
to
attain
such
a
degree
of
tautness
as
would
have
been
necessary
at
this
time
to
have
raised
its
bight
to
the
desired
height
now
presently
the
called
out
to
one
of
the
men
to
make
breakfast
and
when
it
was
ready
we
came
to
it
leaving
the
man
with
the
wounded
arm
to
keep
watch
then
when
we
had
made
an
end
he
sent
him
that
had
lost
his
fingers
to
keep
a
whilst
the
other
came
to
the
fire
and
ate
his
breakfast
and
in
the
meanwhile
the
took
us
down
to
collect
weed
and
reeds
for
the
night
and
so
we
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
morning
and
when
we
had
made
an
end
of
this
we
returned
to
the
top
of
the
hill
to
discover
how
matters
were
going
forward
thus
we
found
from
the
one
at
the
that
they
in
the
hulk
had
been
obliged
to
heave
twice
upon
the
big
rope
to
keep
it
off
the
weed
and
by
this
we
knew
that
the
ship
was
indeed
making
a
slow
sternway
towards
the
island
slipping
steadily
through
the
weed
and
as
we
looked
at
her
it
seemed
almost
that
we
could
perceive
that
she
was
nearer
but
this
was
no
more
than
imagination
for
at
most
she
could
not
have
moved
more
than
some
odd
fathoms
yet
it
cheered
us
greatly
so
that
we
waved
our
congratulations
to
the
man
who
stood
in
the
lookout
in
the
superstructure
and
he
waved
back
later
we
made
dinner
and
afterwards
had
a
very
comfortable
smoke
and
then
the
attended
to
our
various
hurts
and
so
through
the
afternoon
we
sat
about
upon
the
crest
of
the
hill
overlooking
the
hulk
and
thrice
had
they
in
the
ship
to
heave
upon
the
big
rope
and
by
evening
they
had
made
near
thirty
fathoms
towards
the
island
the
which
they
told
us
in
reply
to
a
query
which
the
desired
me
to
send
them
several
messages
having
passed
between
us
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
so
that
we
had
the
carrier
upon
our
side
further
than
this
they
explained
that
they
would
tend
the
rope
during
the
night
so
that
the
strain
would
be
kept
up
and
more
this
would
keep
the
ropes
off
the
weed
and
so
the
night
coming
down
upon
us
the
bade
us
light
the
fires
about
the
top
of
the
hill
the
same
having
been
laid
earlier
in
the
day
and
thus
our
supper
having
been
dispatched
we
prepared
for
the
night
and
all
through
it
there
burned
lights
aboard
the
hulk
the
which
proved
very
companionable
to
us
in
our
times
of
watching
and
so
at
last
came
the
morning
the
darkness
having
passed
without
event
and
now
to
our
huge
pleasure
we
discovered
that
the
ship
had
made
great
progress
in
the
night
being
now
so
much
nearer
that
none
could
suppose
it
a
matter
of
imagination
for
she
must
have
moved
nigh
sixty
fathoms
nearer
to
the
island
so
that
now
we
seemed
able
almost
to
recognize
the
face
of
the
man
in
the
and
many
things
about
the
hulk
we
saw
with
greater
clearness
so
that
we
scanned
her
with
a
fresh
interest
then
the
man
in
the
waved
a
morning
greeting
to
us
the
which
we
returned
very
heartily
and
even
as
we
did
so
there
came
a
second
figure
beside
the
man
and
waved
some
white
matter
perchance
a
handkerchief
which
is
like
enough
seeing
that
it
was
a
woman
and
at
that
we
took
off
our
head
coverings
all
of
us
and
shook
them
at
her
and
after
this
we
went
to
our
breakfast
having
finished
which
the
dressed
our
hurts
and
then
setting
the
man
who
had
lost
his
fingers
to
watch
he
took
the
rest
of
us
excepting
him
that
was
bitten
in
the
arm
down
to
collect
fuel
and
so
the
time
passed
until
near
dinner
when
we
returned
to
the
the
man
upon
the
told
us
that
they
in
the
ship
had
heaved
not
less
than
four
separate
times
upon
the
big
rope
the
which
indeed
they
were
doing
at
that
present
minute
and
it
was
very
plain
to
see
that
the
ship
had
come
nearer
even
during
the
short
space
of
the
morning
now
when
they
had
made
an
end
of
tautening
the
rope
i
perceived
that
it
was
at
last
well
clear
of
the
weed
through
all
its
length
being
at
its
lowest
part
nigh
twenty
feet
above
the
surface
and
at
that
a
sudden
thought
came
to
me
which
sent
me
hastily
to
the
for
it
had
occurred
to
me
that
there
existed
no
reason
why
we
should
not
pay
a
visit
to
those
aboard
the
hulk
but
when
i
put
the
matter
to
him
he
shook
his
head
and
for
awhile
stood
out
against
my
desire
but
presently
having
examined
the
rope
and
considering
that
i
was
the
lightest
of
any
in
the
island
he
consented
and
at
that
i
ran
to
the
carrier
which
had
been
hauled
across
to
our
side
and
got
me
into
the
chair
now
the
men
so
soon
as
they
perceived
my
intention
applauded
me
very
heartily
desiring
to
follow
but
the
bade
them
be
silent
and
after
that
he
lashed
me
into
the
chair
with
his
own
hands
and
then
signaled
to
those
in
the
ship
to
haul
upon
the
small
rope
he
in
the
meanwhile
checking
my
descent
towards
the
weeds
by
means
of
our
end
of
the
and
so
presently
i
had
come
to
the
lowest
part
where
the
bight
of
the
rope
dipped
downward
in
a
bow
towards
the
weed
and
rose
again
to
the
mizzenmast
of
the
hulk
here
i
looked
downward
with
somewhat
fearful
eyes
for
my
weight
on
the
rope
made
it
sag
somewhat
lower
than
seemed
to
me
comfortable
and
i
had
a
very
lively
recollection
of
some
of
the
horrors
which
that
quiet
surface
hid
yet
i
was
not
long
in
this
place
for
they
in
the
ship
perceiving
how
the
rope
let
me
nearer
to
the
weed
than
was
safe
pulled
very
heartily
upon
the
and
so
i
came
quickly
to
the
hulk
now
as
i
drew
nigh
to
the
ship
the
men
crowded
upon
a
little
platform
which
they
had
built
in
the
superstructure
somewhat
below
the
broken
head
of
the
mizzen
and
here
they
received
me
with
loud
cheers
and
very
open
arms
and
were
so
eager
to
get
me
out
of
the
chair
that
they
cut
the
lashings
being
too
impatient
to
cast
them
loose
then
they
led
me
down
to
the
deck
and
here
before
i
had
knowledge
of
aught
else
a
very
buxom
woman
took
me
into
her
arms
kissing
me
right
heartily
at
which
i
was
greatly
taken
aback
but
the
men
about
me
did
naught
but
laugh
and
so
in
a
minute
she
loosed
me
and
there
i
stood
not
knowing
whether
to
feel
like
a
fool
or
a
hero
but
inclining
rather
to
the
latter
then
at
this
minute
there
came
a
second
woman
who
bowed
to
me
in
a
manner
most
formal
so
that
we
might
have
been
met
in
some
fashionable
gathering
rather
than
in
a
hulk
in
the
lonesomeness
and
terror
of
that
sea
and
at
her
coming
all
the
mirth
of
the
men
died
out
of
them
and
they
became
very
sober
whilst
the
buxom
woman
went
backward
for
a
piece
and
seemed
somewhat
abashed
now
at
all
this
i
was
greatly
puzzled
and
looked
from
one
to
another
to
learn
what
it
might
mean
but
in
the
same
moment
the
woman
bowed
again
and
said
something
in
a
low
voice
touching
the
weather
and
after
that
she
raised
her
glance
to
my
face
so
that
i
saw
her
eyes
and
they
were
so
strange
and
full
of
melancholy
that
i
knew
on
the
instant
why
she
spoke
and
acted
in
so
unmeaning
a
way
for
the
poor
creature
was
out
of
her
mind
and
when
i
learnt
afterwards
that
she
was
the
wife
and
had
seen
him
die
in
the
arms
of
a
mighty
i
grew
to
understand
how
she
had
come
to
such
a
pass
now
for
a
minute
after
i
had
discovered
the
woman
madness
i
was
so
taken
aback
as
to
be
unable
to
answer
her
remark
but
for
this
there
appeared
no
necessity
for
she
turned
away
and
went
aft
towards
the
saloon
stairway
which
stood
open
and
here
she
was
met
by
a
maid
very
bonny
and
fair
who
led
her
tenderly
down
from
my
sight
yet
in
a
minute
this
same
maid
appeared
and
ran
along
the
decks
to
me
and
caught
my
two
hands
and
shook
them
and
looked
up
at
me
with
such
roguish
playful
eyes
that
she
warmed
my
heart
which
had
been
strangely
chilled
by
the
greeting
of
the
poor
mad
woman
and
she
said
many
hearty
things
regarding
my
courage
to
which
i
knew
in
my
heart
i
had
no
claim
but
i
let
her
run
on
and
so
presently
coming
more
to
possession
of
herself
she
discovered
that
she
was
still
holding
my
hands
the
which
indeed
i
had
been
conscious
of
the
while
with
a
very
great
pleasure
but
at
her
discovery
she
dropped
them
with
haste
and
stood
back
from
me
a
space
and
so
there
came
a
little
coolness
into
her
talk
yet
this
lasted
not
long
for
we
were
both
of
us
young
and
i
think
even
thus
early
we
attracted
one
the
other
though
apart
from
this
there
was
so
much
that
we
desired
each
to
learn
that
we
could
not
but
talk
freely
asking
question
for
question
and
giving
answer
for
answer
and
thus
a
time
passed
in
which
the
men
left
us
alone
and
went
presently
to
the
capstan
about
which
they
had
taken
the
big
rope
and
at
this
they
toiled
awhile
for
already
the
ship
had
moved
sufficiently
to
let
the
line
fall
slack
presently
the
maid
whom
i
had
learnt
was
niece
to
the
captain
wife
and
named
mary
madison
proposed
to
take
me
the
round
of
the
ship
to
which
proposal
i
agreed
very
willingly
but
first
i
stopped
to
examine
the
mizzen
stump
and
the
manner
in
which
the
people
of
the
ship
had
stayed
it
the
which
they
had
done
very
cunningly
and
i
noted
how
that
they
had
removed
some
of
the
superstructure
from
about
the
head
of
the
mast
so
as
to
allow
passage
for
the
rope
without
putting
a
strain
upon
the
superstructure
itself
then
when
i
had
made
an
end
upon
the
poop
she
led
me
down
on
to
the
and
here
i
was
very
greatly
impressed
by
the
prodigious
size
of
the
structure
which
they
had
built
about
the
hulk
and
the
skill
with
which
it
had
been
carried
out
the
supports
crossing
from
side
to
side
and
to
the
decks
in
a
manner
calculated
to
give
great
solidity
to
that
which
they
upheld
yet
i
was
very
greatly
puzzled
to
know
where
they
had
gotten
a
sufficiency
of
timber
to
make
so
large
a
matter
but
upon
this
point
she
satisfied
me
by
explaining
that
they
had
taken
up
the
decks
and
used
all
such
bulkheads
as
they
could
spare
and
further
that
there
had
been
a
good
deal
among
the
dunnage
which
had
proved
usable
and
so
we
came
at
last
to
the
galley
and
here
i
discovered
the
buxom
woman
to
be
installed
as
cook
and
there
were
in
with
her
a
couple
of
fine
children
one
of
whom
i
guessed
to
be
a
boy
of
maybe
some
five
years
and
the
second
a
girl
scarce
able
to
do
more
than
toddle
at
this
i
turned
and
asked
mistress
madison
whether
these
were
her
cousins
but
in
the
next
moment
i
remembered
that
they
could
not
be
for
as
i
knew
the
captain
had
been
dead
some
seven
years
yet
it
was
the
woman
in
the
galley
who
answered
my
question
for
she
turned
and
with
something
of
a
red
face
informed
me
that
they
were
hers
at
which
i
felt
some
surprise
but
supposed
that
she
had
taken
passage
in
the
ship
with
her
husband
yet
in
this
i
was
not
correct
for
she
proceeded
to
explain
that
thinking
they
were
cut
off
from
the
world
for
the
rest
of
this
life
and
falling
very
fond
of
the
carpenter
they
had
made
it
up
together
to
make
a
sort
of
marriage
and
had
gotten
the
second
mate
to
read
the
service
over
them
she
told
me
then
how
that
she
had
taken
passage
with
her
mistress
the
captain
wife
to
help
her
with
her
niece
who
had
been
but
a
child
when
the
ship
sailed
for
she
had
been
very
attached
to
them
both
and
they
to
her
and
so
she
came
to
an
end
of
her
story
expressing
a
hope
that
she
had
done
no
wrong
by
her
marriage
as
none
had
been
intended
and
to
this
i
made
answer
assuring
her
that
no
man
could
think
the
worse
of
her
but
that
i
for
my
part
thought
rather
the
better
seeing
that
i
liked
the
pluck
which
she
had
shown
at
that
she
cast
down
the
soup
ladle
which
she
had
in
her
fist
and
came
towards
me
wiping
her
hands
but
i
gave
back
for
i
shamed
to
be
hugged
again
and
before
mistress
mary
madison
and
at
that
she
came
to
a
stop
and
laughed
very
heartily
but
all
the
same
called
down
a
very
warm
blessing
upon
my
head
for
which
i
had
no
cause
to
feel
the
worse
and
so
i
passed
on
with
the
captain
niece
presently
having
made
the
round
of
the
hulk
we
came
aft
again
to
the
poop
and
discovered
that
they
were
heaving
once
more
upon
the
big
rope
the
which
was
very
heartening
proving
as
it
did
that
the
ship
was
still
and
so
a
little
later
the
girl
left
me
having
to
attend
to
her
aunt
now
whilst
she
was
gone
the
men
came
all
about
me
desiring
news
of
the
world
beyond
the
and
so
for
the
next
hour
i
was
kept
very
busy
answering
their
questions
then
the
second
mate
called
out
to
them
to
take
another
heave
upon
the
rope
and
at
that
they
turned
to
the
capstan
and
i
with
them
and
so
we
hove
it
taut
again
after
which
they
got
about
me
once
more
questioning
for
so
much
seemed
to
have
happened
in
the
seven
years
in
which
they
had
been
imprisoned
and
then
after
a
while
i
and
questioned
them
on
such
points
as
i
had
neglected
to
ask
mistress
madison
and
they
discovered
to
me
their
terror
and
sickness
of
the
its
desolation
and
horror
and
the
dread
which
had
beset
them
at
the
thought
that
they
should
all
of
them
come
to
their
ends
without
sight
of
their
homes
and
countrymen
now
about
this
time
i
became
conscious
that
i
had
grown
very
empty
for
i
had
come
off
to
the
hulk
before
we
had
made
our
dinner
and
had
been
in
such
interest
since
that
the
thought
of
food
had
escaped
me
for
i
had
seen
none
eating
in
the
hulk
they
without
doubt
having
dined
earlier
than
my
coming
but
now
being
made
aware
of
my
state
by
the
grumbling
of
my
stomach
i
inquired
whether
there
was
any
food
to
be
had
at
such
a
time
and
at
that
one
of
the
men
ran
to
tell
the
woman
in
the
galley
that
i
had
missed
my
dinner
at
which
she
made
much
ado
and
and
prepared
me
a
very
good
meal
which
she
carried
aft
and
set
out
for
me
in
the
saloon
and
after
that
she
sent
me
down
to
it
presently
when
i
had
come
near
to
being
comfortable
there
chanced
a
lightsome
step
upon
the
floor
behind
me
and
turning
i
discovered
that
mistress
madison
was
surveying
me
with
a
roguish
and
somewhat
amused
air
at
that
i
got
hastily
to
my
feet
but
she
bade
me
sit
down
and
therewith
she
took
a
seat
opposite
and
so
bantered
me
with
a
gentle
playfulness
that
was
not
displeasing
to
me
and
at
which
i
played
so
good
a
second
as
i
had
ability
later
i
fell
to
questioning
her
and
among
other
matters
discovered
that
it
was
she
who
acted
as
scribe
for
the
people
in
the
hulk
at
which
i
told
her
that
i
had
done
likewise
for
those
on
the
island
after
that
our
talk
became
somewhat
personal
and
i
learnt
that
she
was
near
on
to
nineteen
years
of
age
whereat
i
told
her
that
i
had
passed
my
and
so
we
chatted
on
until
presently
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
better
be
preparing
to
return
to
the
island
and
i
rose
to
my
feet
with
this
intention
yet
feeling
that
i
had
been
very
much
happier
to
have
stayed
the
which
i
thought
for
a
moment
had
not
been
displeasing
to
her
and
this
i
imagined
noting
somewhat
in
her
eyes
when
i
made
mention
that
i
must
be
gone
yet
it
may
be
that
i
flattered
myself
now
when
i
came
out
on
deck
they
were
busied
again
in
heaving
taut
the
rope
and
until
they
had
made
an
end
mistress
madison
and
i
filled
the
time
with
such
chatter
as
is
wholesome
between
a
man
and
maid
who
have
not
long
met
yet
find
one
another
pleasing
company
then
when
at
last
the
rope
was
taut
i
went
up
to
the
mizzen
staging
and
climbed
into
the
chair
after
which
some
of
the
men
lashed
me
in
very
securely
yet
when
they
gave
the
signal
to
haul
me
to
the
island
there
came
for
awhile
no
response
and
then
signs
that
we
could
not
understand
but
no
movement
to
haul
me
across
the
weed
at
that
they
unlashed
me
from
the
chair
bidding
me
get
out
whilst
they
sent
a
message
to
discover
what
might
be
wrong
and
this
they
did
and
presently
there
came
back
word
that
the
big
rope
had
stranded
upon
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
that
they
must
slacken
it
somewhat
at
once
the
which
they
did
with
many
expressions
of
dismay
and
so
maybe
an
hour
passed
during
which
we
watched
the
men
working
at
the
rope
just
where
it
came
down
over
the
edge
of
the
hill
and
mistress
madison
stood
with
us
and
watched
for
it
was
very
terrible
this
sudden
thought
of
failure
though
it
were
but
temporary
when
they
were
so
near
to
success
yet
at
last
there
came
a
signal
from
the
island
for
us
to
loose
the
the
which
we
did
allowing
them
to
haul
across
the
carrier
and
so
in
a
little
while
they
signaled
back
to
us
to
pull
in
which
having
done
we
found
a
letter
in
the
bag
lashed
to
the
carrier
in
which
the
made
it
plain
that
he
had
strengthened
the
rope
and
placed
fresh
chafing
gear
about
it
so
that
he
thought
it
would
be
so
safe
as
ever
to
heave
upon
but
to
put
it
to
a
less
strain
yet
he
refused
to
allow
me
to
venture
across
upon
it
saying
that
i
must
stay
in
the
ship
until
we
were
clear
of
the
weed
for
if
the
rope
had
stranded
in
one
place
then
had
it
been
so
cruelly
tested
that
there
might
be
some
other
points
at
which
it
was
ready
to
give
and
this
final
note
of
the
made
us
all
very
serious
for
indeed
it
seemed
possible
that
it
was
as
he
suggested
yet
they
reassured
themselves
by
pointing
out
that
like
enough
it
had
been
the
chafe
upon
the
cliff
edge
which
had
frayed
the
strand
so
that
it
had
been
weakened
before
it
parted
but
i
remembering
the
chafing
gear
which
the
had
put
about
it
in
the
first
instance
felt
not
so
sure
yet
i
would
not
add
to
their
anxieties
and
so
it
came
about
that
i
was
compelled
to
spend
the
night
in
the
hulk
but
as
i
followed
mistress
madison
into
the
big
saloon
i
felt
no
regret
and
had
near
forgotten
already
my
anxiety
regarding
the
rope
and
out
on
deck
there
sounded
most
cheerily
the
clack
of
the
capstan
xvi
freed
now
when
mistress
madison
had
seated
herself
she
invited
me
to
do
likewise
after
which
we
fell
into
talk
first
touching
upon
the
matter
of
the
stranding
of
the
rope
about
which
i
hastened
to
assure
her
and
later
to
other
things
and
so
as
is
natural
enough
with
a
man
and
maid
to
ourselves
and
here
we
were
very
content
to
let
it
remain
presently
the
second
mate
came
in
with
a
note
from
the
which
he
laid
upon
the
table
for
the
girl
to
read
the
which
she
beckoned
me
to
do
also
and
so
i
discovered
that
it
was
a
suggestion
written
very
rudely
and
that
they
should
send
us
a
quantity
of
reeds
from
the
island
with
which
we
might
be
able
to
ease
the
weed
somewhat
from
around
the
stern
of
the
hulk
thus
aiding
her
progress
and
to
this
the
second
mate
desired
the
girl
to
write
a
reply
saying
that
we
should
be
very
happy
for
the
reeds
and
would
endeavor
to
act
upon
his
hint
and
this
mistress
madison
did
after
which
she
passed
the
letter
to
me
perchance
i
desired
to
send
any
message
yet
i
had
naught
that
i
wished
to
say
and
so
handed
it
back
with
a
word
of
thanks
and
at
once
she
gave
it
to
the
second
mate
who
went
forthwith
and
dispatched
it
later
the
stout
woman
from
the
galley
came
aft
to
set
out
the
table
which
occupied
the
center
of
the
saloon
and
whilst
she
was
at
this
she
asked
for
information
on
many
things
being
very
free
and
unaffected
in
her
speech
and
seeming
with
less
of
deference
to
my
companion
than
a
certain
motherliness
for
it
was
very
plain
that
she
loved
mistress
madison
and
in
this
my
heart
did
not
blame
her
further
it
was
plain
to
me
that
the
girl
had
a
very
warm
affection
for
her
old
nurse
which
was
but
natural
seeing
that
the
old
woman
had
cared
for
her
through
all
the
past
years
besides
being
companion
to
her
and
a
good
and
cheerful
one
as
i
could
guess
now
awhile
i
passed
in
answering
the
buxom
woman
questions
and
odd
times
such
occasional
ones
as
were
slipped
in
by
mistress
madison
and
then
suddenly
there
came
the
clatter
of
men
feet
overhead
and
later
the
thud
of
something
being
cast
down
upon
the
deck
and
so
we
knew
that
the
reeds
had
come
at
that
mistress
madison
cried
out
that
we
should
go
and
watch
the
men
try
them
upon
the
weed
for
that
if
they
proved
of
use
in
easing
that
which
lay
in
our
path
then
should
we
come
the
more
speedily
to
the
clear
water
and
this
without
the
need
of
putting
so
great
a
strain
upon
the
hawser
as
had
been
the
case
hitherto
when
we
came
to
the
poop
we
found
the
men
removing
a
portion
of
the
superstructure
over
the
stern
and
after
that
they
took
some
of
the
stronger
reeds
and
proceeded
to
work
at
the
weed
that
stretched
away
in
a
line
with
our
taffrail
yet
that
they
anticipated
danger
i
perceived
for
there
stood
by
them
two
of
the
men
and
the
second
mate
all
armed
with
muskets
and
these
three
kept
a
very
strict
watch
upon
the
weed
knowing
through
much
experience
of
its
terrors
how
that
there
might
be
a
need
for
their
weapons
at
any
moment
and
so
a
while
passed
and
it
was
plain
that
the
men
work
upon
the
weed
was
having
effect
for
the
rope
grew
slack
visibly
and
those
at
the
capstan
had
all
that
they
could
do
taking
fleet
and
fleet
with
the
tackle
to
keep
it
anywhere
near
to
tautness
and
so
perceiving
that
they
were
kept
so
hard
at
it
i
ran
to
give
a
hand
the
which
did
mistress
madison
pushing
upon
the
right
merrily
and
with
heartiness
and
thus
a
while
passed
and
the
evening
began
to
come
down
upon
the
lonesomeness
of
the
then
there
appeared
the
buxom
woman
and
bade
us
come
to
our
suppers
and
her
manner
of
addressing
the
two
of
us
was
the
manner
of
one
who
might
have
mothered
us
but
mistress
madison
cried
out
to
her
to
wait
that
we
had
found
work
to
do
and
at
that
the
big
woman
laughed
and
came
towards
us
threateningly
as
though
intending
to
remove
us
hence
by
force
and
now
at
this
moment
there
came
a
sudden
interruption
which
checked
our
merriment
for
abruptly
there
sounded
the
report
of
a
musket
in
the
stern
and
then
came
shouts
and
the
noise
of
the
two
other
weapons
seeming
like
thunder
being
pent
by
the
superstructure
and
directly
the
men
about
the
taffrail
gave
back
running
here
and
there
and
so
i
saw
that
great
arms
had
come
all
about
the
opening
which
they
had
made
in
the
superstructure
and
two
of
these
flickered
searching
hither
and
thither
but
the
stout
woman
took
a
man
near
to
her
and
thrust
him
out
of
danger
and
after
that
she
caught
mistress
madison
up
in
her
big
arms
and
ran
down
on
to
the
with
her
and
all
this
before
i
had
come
to
a
full
knowledge
of
our
danger
but
now
i
perceived
that
i
should
do
well
to
get
further
back
from
the
stern
the
which
i
did
with
haste
and
coming
to
a
safe
position
i
stood
and
stared
at
the
huge
creature
its
great
arms
vague
in
the
growing
dusk
writhing
about
in
vain
search
for
a
victim
then
returned
the
second
mate
having
been
for
more
weapons
and
now
i
observed
that
he
armed
all
the
men
and
had
brought
up
a
spare
musket
for
my
use
and
so
we
commenced
all
of
us
to
fire
at
the
monster
whereat
it
began
to
lash
about
most
furiously
and
so
after
some
minutes
it
slipped
away
from
the
opening
and
slid
down
into
the
weed
upon
that
several
of
the
men
rushed
to
replace
those
parts
of
the
superstructure
which
had
been
removed
and
i
with
them
yet
there
were
sufficient
for
the
job
so
that
i
had
no
need
to
do
aught
thus
before
they
had
made
up
the
opening
i
had
been
given
chance
to
look
out
upon
the
weed
and
so
discovered
that
all
the
surface
which
lay
between
our
stern
and
the
island
was
moving
in
vast
ripples
as
though
mighty
fish
were
swimming
beneath
it
and
then
just
before
the
men
put
back
the
last
of
the
great
panels
i
saw
the
weed
all
tossed
up
like
to
a
vast
pot
and
then
a
vague
glimpse
of
thousands
of
monstrous
arms
that
filled
the
air
and
came
towards
the
ship
and
then
the
men
had
the
panel
back
in
its
place
and
were
hasting
to
drive
the
supporting
struts
into
their
positions
and
when
this
was
done
we
stood
awhile
and
listened
but
there
came
no
sound
above
that
of
the
wail
of
the
wind
across
the
extent
of
the
and
at
that
i
turned
to
the
men
asking
how
it
was
that
i
could
hear
no
sounds
of
the
creatures
attacking
us
and
so
they
took
me
up
into
the
place
and
from
there
i
stared
down
at
the
weed
but
it
was
without
movement
save
for
the
stirring
of
the
wind
and
there
was
nowhere
any
sign
of
the
then
seeing
me
amazed
they
told
me
how
that
anything
which
moved
the
weed
seemed
to
draw
them
from
all
parts
but
that
they
seldom
touched
the
hulk
unless
there
was
something
visible
to
them
which
had
movement
yet
as
they
went
on
to
explain
there
would
be
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
them
lying
all
about
the
ship
hiding
in
the
weed
but
that
if
we
took
care
not
to
show
ourselves
within
their
reach
they
would
have
gone
most
of
them
by
the
morning
and
this
the
men
told
me
in
a
very
way
for
they
had
become
inured
to
such
happenings
presently
i
heard
mistress
madison
calling
to
me
by
name
and
so
descended
out
of
the
growing
darkness
to
the
interior
of
the
superstructure
and
here
they
had
lit
a
number
of
rude
the
oil
for
which
as
i
learned
later
they
obtained
from
a
certain
fish
which
haunted
the
sea
beneath
the
weed
in
very
large
schools
and
took
near
any
sort
of
bait
with
great
readiness
and
so
when
i
had
climbed
down
into
the
light
i
found
the
girl
waiting
for
me
to
come
to
supper
for
which
i
discovered
myself
to
be
in
a
mightily
agreeable
humor
presently
having
made
an
end
of
eating
she
leaned
back
in
her
seat
and
commenced
once
more
to
bait
me
in
her
playful
manner
the
which
appeared
to
afford
her
much
pleasure
and
in
which
i
joined
with
no
less
and
so
we
fell
presently
to
more
earnest
talk
and
in
this
wise
we
passed
a
great
space
of
the
evening
then
there
came
to
her
a
sudden
idea
and
what
must
she
do
but
propose
that
we
should
climb
to
the
lookout
and
to
this
i
agreed
with
a
very
happy
willingness
and
to
the
lookout
we
went
now
when
we
had
come
there
i
perceived
her
reason
for
this
freak
for
away
in
the
night
astern
the
hulk
there
blazed
between
the
heaven
and
the
sea
a
mighty
glow
and
suddenly
as
i
stared
being
dumb
with
admiration
and
surprise
i
knew
that
it
was
the
blaze
of
our
fires
upon
the
crown
of
the
bigger
hill
for
all
the
hill
being
in
shadow
and
hidden
by
the
darkness
there
showed
only
the
glow
of
the
fires
hung
as
it
were
in
the
void
and
a
very
striking
and
beautiful
spectacle
it
was
then
as
i
watched
there
came
abruptly
a
figure
into
view
upon
the
edge
of
the
glow
showing
black
and
minute
and
this
i
knew
to
be
one
of
the
men
come
to
the
edge
of
the
hill
to
take
a
look
at
the
hulk
or
test
the
strain
on
the
hawser
now
upon
my
expressing
admiration
of
the
sight
to
mistress
madison
she
seemed
greatly
pleased
and
told
me
that
she
had
been
up
many
times
in
the
darkness
to
view
it
and
after
that
we
went
down
again
into
the
interior
of
the
superstructure
and
here
the
men
were
taking
a
further
heave
upon
the
big
rope
before
settling
the
watches
for
the
night
the
which
they
managed
by
having
one
man
at
a
time
to
keep
awake
and
call
the
rest
whenever
the
hawser
grew
slack
later
mistress
madison
showed
me
where
i
was
to
sleep
and
so
having
bid
one
another
a
very
warm
we
parted
she
going
to
see
that
her
aunt
was
comfortable
and
i
out
on
to
the
to
have
a
chat
with
the
man
on
watch
in
this
way
i
passed
the
time
until
midnight
and
in
that
while
we
had
been
forced
to
call
the
men
thrice
to
heave
upon
the
hawser
so
quickly
had
the
ship
begun
to
make
way
through
the
weed
then
having
grown
sleepy
i
said
goodnight
and
went
to
my
berth
and
so
had
my
first
sleep
upon
a
mattress
for
some
weeks
now
when
the
morning
was
come
i
waked
hearing
mistress
madison
calling
upon
me
from
the
other
side
of
my
door
and
rating
me
very
saucily
for
a
and
at
that
i
made
good
speed
at
dressing
and
came
quickly
into
the
saloon
where
she
had
ready
a
breakfast
that
made
me
glad
i
had
waked
but
first
before
she
would
do
aught
else
she
had
me
out
to
the
lookout
place
running
up
before
me
most
merrily
and
singing
in
the
fullness
of
her
glee
and
so
when
i
had
come
to
the
top
of
the
superstructure
i
perceived
that
she
had
very
good
reason
for
so
much
merriment
and
the
sight
which
came
to
my
eyes
gladdened
me
most
mightily
yet
at
the
same
time
filling
me
with
a
great
amazement
for
behold
in
the
course
of
that
one
night
we
had
made
near
unto
two
hundred
fathoms
across
the
weed
being
now
with
what
we
had
made
previously
no
more
than
some
thirty
fathoms
in
from
the
edge
of
the
weed
and
there
stood
mistress
madison
beside
me
doing
somewhat
of
a
dainty
upon
the
flooring
of
the
and
singing
a
quaint
old
lilt
that
i
had
not
heard
that
dozen
years
and
this
little
thing
i
think
brought
back
more
clearly
to
me
than
aught
else
how
that
this
winsome
maid
had
been
lost
to
the
world
for
so
many
years
having
been
scarce
of
the
age
of
twelve
when
the
ship
had
been
lost
in
the
then
as
i
turned
to
make
some
remark
being
filled
with
many
feelings
there
came
a
hail
from
far
above
in
the
air
as
it
might
be
and
looking
up
i
discovered
the
man
upon
the
hill
to
be
standing
along
the
edge
and
waving
to
us
and
now
i
perceived
how
that
the
hill
towered
a
very
great
way
above
us
seeming
as
it
were
to
overhang
the
hulk
though
we
were
yet
some
seventy
fathoms
distant
from
the
sheer
sweep
of
its
nearer
precipice
and
so
having
waved
back
our
greeting
we
made
down
to
breakfast
and
having
come
to
the
saloon
upon
the
good
victuals
and
did
very
sound
justice
thereto
presently
having
made
an
end
of
eating
and
hearing
the
clack
of
the
we
hurried
out
on
deck
and
put
our
hands
upon
the
bars
intending
to
join
in
that
last
heave
which
should
bring
the
ship
free
out
of
her
long
captivity
and
so
for
a
time
we
moved
round
about
the
capstan
and
i
glanced
at
the
girl
beside
me
for
she
had
become
very
solemn
and
indeed
it
was
a
strange
and
solemn
time
for
her
for
she
who
had
dreamed
of
the
world
as
her
childish
eyes
had
seen
it
was
now
after
many
hopeless
years
to
go
forth
once
more
to
it
to
live
in
it
and
to
learn
how
much
had
been
dreams
and
how
much
real
and
with
all
these
thoughts
i
credited
her
for
they
seemed
such
as
would
have
come
to
me
at
such
a
time
and
presently
i
made
some
blundering
effort
to
show
to
her
that
i
had
understanding
of
the
tumult
which
possessed
her
and
at
that
she
smiled
up
at
me
with
a
sudden
queer
flash
of
sadness
and
merriment
and
our
glances
met
and
i
saw
something
in
hers
which
was
but
newborn
and
though
i
was
but
a
young
man
my
heart
interpreted
it
for
me
and
i
was
all
hot
suddenly
with
the
pain
and
sweet
delight
of
this
new
thing
for
i
had
not
dared
to
think
upon
that
which
already
my
heart
had
made
bold
to
whisper
to
me
so
that
even
thus
soon
i
was
miserable
out
of
her
presence
then
she
looked
downward
at
her
hands
upon
the
bar
and
in
the
same
instant
there
came
a
loud
abrupt
cry
from
the
second
mate
to
vast
heaving
and
at
that
all
the
men
pulled
out
their
bars
and
cast
them
upon
the
deck
and
ran
shouting
to
the
ladder
that
led
to
the
and
we
followed
and
so
came
to
the
top
and
discovered
that
at
last
the
ship
was
clear
of
the
weed
and
floating
in
the
open
water
between
it
and
the
island
now
at
the
discovery
that
the
hulk
was
free
the
men
commenced
to
cheer
and
shout
in
a
very
wild
fashion
as
indeed
is
no
cause
for
wonder
and
we
cheered
with
them
then
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
our
shouting
mistress
madison
plucked
me
by
the
sleeve
and
pointed
to
the
end
of
the
island
where
the
foot
of
the
bigger
hill
jutted
out
in
a
great
spur
and
now
i
perceived
a
boat
coming
round
into
view
and
in
another
moment
i
saw
that
the
stood
in
the
stern
steering
thus
i
knew
that
he
must
have
finished
repairing
her
whilst
i
had
been
on
the
hulk
by
this
the
men
about
us
had
discovered
the
nearness
of
the
boat
and
commenced
shouting
afresh
and
they
ran
down
and
to
the
bows
of
the
vessel
and
got
ready
a
rope
to
cast
now
when
the
boat
came
near
the
men
in
her
scanned
us
very
curiously
but
the
took
off
his
with
a
clumsy
grace
that
well
became
him
at
which
mistress
madison
smiled
very
kindly
upon
him
and
after
that
she
told
me
with
great
frankness
that
he
pleased
her
and
more
that
she
had
never
seen
so
great
a
man
which
was
not
strange
seeing
that
she
had
seen
but
few
since
she
had
come
to
years
when
men
become
of
interest
to
a
maid
after
saluting
us
the
called
out
to
the
second
mate
that
he
would
tow
us
round
to
the
far
side
of
the
island
and
to
this
the
officer
agreed
being
i
surmised
by
no
means
sorry
to
put
some
solid
matter
between
himself
and
the
desolation
of
the
great
and
so
having
loosed
the
hawser
which
fell
from
the
with
a
prodigious
splash
we
had
the
boat
head
towing
in
this
wise
we
opened
out
presently
the
end
of
the
hill
but
feeling
now
the
force
of
the
breeze
we
bent
a
kedge
to
the
hawser
and
the
carrying
it
seawards
we
warped
ourselves
to
windward
of
the
island
and
here
in
forty
fathoms
we
vast
heaving
and
rode
to
the
kedge
now
when
this
was
accomplished
they
called
to
our
men
to
come
aboard
and
this
they
did
and
spent
all
of
that
day
in
talk
and
eating
for
those
in
the
ship
could
scarce
make
enough
of
our
fellows
and
then
when
it
had
come
to
night
they
replaced
that
part
of
the
superstructure
which
they
had
removed
from
about
the
head
of
the
and
so
all
being
secure
each
one
and
had
a
full
night
rest
of
the
which
indeed
many
of
them
stood
in
sore
need
the
following
morning
the
second
mate
had
a
consultation
with
the
after
which
he
gave
the
order
to
commence
upon
the
removal
of
the
great
superstructure
and
to
this
each
one
of
us
set
himself
with
vigor
yet
it
was
a
work
requiring
some
time
and
near
five
days
had
passed
before
we
had
the
ship
stripped
clear
when
this
had
been
accomplished
there
came
a
busy
time
of
routing
out
various
matter
of
which
we
should
have
need
in
jury
rigging
her
for
they
had
been
so
long
in
disuse
that
none
remembered
where
to
look
for
them
at
this
a
day
and
a
half
was
spent
and
after
that
we
about
fitting
her
with
such
as
we
could
manage
from
our
material
now
after
the
ship
had
been
dismasted
all
those
seven
years
gone
the
crew
had
been
able
to
save
many
of
her
spars
these
having
remained
attached
to
her
through
their
inability
to
cut
away
all
of
the
gear
and
though
this
had
put
them
in
sore
peril
at
the
time
of
being
sent
to
the
bottom
with
a
hole
in
their
side
yet
now
had
they
every
reason
to
be
thankful
for
by
this
accident
we
had
now
a
foreyard
a
a
main
and
the
they
had
saved
more
than
these
but
had
made
use
of
the
smaller
spars
to
shore
up
the
superstructure
sawing
them
into
lengths
for
that
purpose
apart
from
such
spars
as
they
had
managed
to
secure
they
had
a
spare
topmast
lashed
along
under
the
larboard
bulwarks
and
a
spare
and
royal
mast
lying
along
the
starboard
side
now
the
second
mate
and
the
set
the
carpenter
to
work
upon
the
spare
topmast
bidding
him
make
for
it
some
and
bolsters
upon
which
to
lay
the
eyes
of
the
rigging
but
they
did
not
trouble
him
to
shape
it
further
they
ordered
the
same
to
be
fitted
to
the
foretopmast
and
the
spare
and
royal
mast
and
in
the
meanwhile
the
rigging
was
prepared
and
when
this
was
finished
they
made
ready
the
shears
to
hoist
the
spare
topmast
intending
this
to
take
the
place
of
the
main
then
when
the
carpenter
had
carried
out
their
orders
he
was
set
to
make
three
partners
with
a
step
cut
in
each
these
being
intended
to
take
the
heels
of
the
three
masts
and
when
these
were
completed
they
bolted
them
securely
to
the
decks
at
the
fore
part
of
each
one
of
the
stumps
of
the
three
and
so
having
all
ready
we
hove
the
mainmast
into
position
after
which
we
proceeded
to
rig
it
now
when
we
had
made
an
end
of
this
we
upon
the
foremast
using
for
this
the
foretopmast
which
they
had
saved
and
after
that
we
hove
the
mizzenmast
into
place
having
for
this
the
spare
and
royal
mast
now
the
manner
in
which
we
secured
the
masts
before
ever
we
came
to
the
rigging
of
them
was
by
lashing
them
to
the
stumps
of
the
and
after
we
had
lashed
them
we
drove
dunnage
and
wedges
between
the
masts
and
the
lashings
thus
making
them
very
secure
and
so
when
we
had
set
up
the
rigging
we
had
confidence
that
they
would
stand
all
such
sail
as
we
should
be
able
to
set
upon
them
yet
further
than
this
the
bade
the
carpenter
make
wooden
caps
of
six
inch
oak
these
caps
to
fit
over
the
heads
of
the
stumps
and
having
a
hole
each
of
them
to
embrace
the
and
by
making
these
caps
in
two
halves
they
were
able
to
bolt
them
on
after
the
masts
had
been
hove
into
position
and
so
having
gotten
in
our
three
jury
we
hoisted
up
the
foreyard
to
the
main
to
act
as
our
mainyard
and
did
likewise
with
the
to
the
fore
and
after
that
we
sent
up
the
to
the
mizzen
thus
we
had
her
sparred
all
but
a
bowsprit
and
jibboom
yet
this
we
managed
by
making
a
stumpy
spike
bowsprit
from
one
of
the
smaller
spars
which
they
had
used
to
shore
up
the
superstructure
and
because
we
feared
that
it
lacked
strength
to
bear
the
strain
of
our
fore
and
aft
stays
we
took
down
two
hawsers
from
the
fore
passing
them
in
through
the
and
setting
them
up
there
and
so
we
had
her
rigged
and
after
that
we
bent
such
sail
as
our
gear
abled
us
to
carry
and
in
this
wise
had
the
hulk
ready
for
sea
now
the
time
that
it
took
us
to
rig
the
ship
and
fit
her
out
was
seven
weeks
saving
one
day
and
in
all
this
time
we
suffered
no
molestation
from
any
of
the
strange
habitants
of
the
though
this
may
have
been
because
we
kept
fires
of
dried
weed
going
all
the
night
about
the
decks
these
fires
being
lit
on
big
flat
pieces
of
rock
which
we
had
gotten
from
the
island
yet
for
all
that
we
had
not
been
troubled
we
had
more
than
once
discovered
strange
things
in
the
water
swimming
near
to
the
vessel
but
a
flare
of
weed
hung
over
the
side
on
the
end
of
a
reed
had
sufficed
always
to
scare
away
such
unholy
visitants
and
so
at
last
we
came
to
the
day
on
which
we
were
in
so
good
a
condition
that
the
and
the
second
mate
considered
the
ship
to
be
in
a
fit
state
to
put
to
sea
the
carpenter
having
gone
over
so
much
of
her
hull
as
he
could
get
at
and
found
her
everywhere
very
sound
though
her
lower
parts
were
hideously
overgrown
with
weed
barnacles
and
other
matters
yet
this
we
could
not
help
and
it
was
not
wise
to
attempt
to
scrape
her
having
consideration
to
the
creatures
which
we
knew
to
abound
in
those
waters
now
in
those
seven
weeks
mistress
madison
and
i
had
come
very
close
to
one
another
so
that
i
had
ceased
to
call
her
by
any
name
save
mary
unless
it
were
a
dearer
one
than
that
though
this
would
be
one
of
my
own
invention
and
would
leave
my
heart
too
naked
did
i
put
it
down
here
of
our
love
one
for
the
other
i
think
yet
and
ponder
how
that
mighty
man
the
came
so
quickly
to
a
knowledge
of
the
state
of
our
hearts
for
he
gave
me
a
very
sly
hint
one
day
that
he
had
a
sound
idea
of
the
way
in
which
the
wind
blew
and
yet
though
he
said
it
with
a
methought
there
was
something
wistful
in
his
voice
as
he
spoke
and
at
that
i
just
clapped
my
hand
in
his
and
he
gave
it
a
very
huge
grip
and
after
that
he
ceased
from
the
subject
xvii
how
we
came
to
our
own
country
now
when
the
day
came
on
which
we
made
to
leave
the
nearness
of
the
island
and
the
waters
of
that
strange
sea
there
was
great
lightness
of
heart
among
us
and
we
went
very
merrily
about
such
tasks
as
were
needful
and
so
in
a
little
we
had
the
kedge
tripped
and
had
cast
the
ship
head
to
starboard
and
presently
had
her
braced
up
upon
the
larboard
tack
the
which
we
managed
very
well
though
our
gear
worked
heavily
as
might
be
expected
and
after
that
we
had
gotten
under
way
we
went
to
the
lee
side
to
witness
the
last
of
that
lonesome
island
and
with
us
came
the
men
of
the
ship
and
so
for
a
space
there
was
a
silence
among
us
for
they
were
very
quiet
looking
astern
and
saying
naught
but
we
had
sympathy
with
them
knowing
somewhat
of
those
past
years
and
now
the
came
to
the
break
of
the
poop
and
called
down
to
the
men
to
muster
aft
the
which
they
did
and
i
with
them
for
i
had
come
to
regard
them
as
my
very
good
comrades
and
rum
was
served
out
to
each
of
them
and
to
me
along
with
the
rest
and
it
was
mistress
madison
herself
who
dipped
it
out
to
us
from
the
wooden
bucket
though
it
was
the
buxom
woman
who
had
brought
it
up
from
the
lazarette
now
after
the
rum
the
bade
the
crew
to
clear
up
the
gear
about
the
decks
and
get
matters
secured
and
at
that
i
turned
to
go
with
the
men
having
become
so
used
to
work
with
them
but
he
called
to
me
to
come
up
to
him
upon
the
poop
the
which
i
did
and
there
he
spoke
respectfully
remonstrating
with
me
and
reminding
me
that
now
there
was
need
no
longer
for
me
to
toil
for
that
i
was
come
back
to
my
old
position
of
passenger
such
as
i
had
been
in
the
ere
she
foundered
but
to
this
talk
of
his
i
made
reply
that
i
had
as
good
a
right
to
work
my
passage
home
as
any
other
among
us
for
though
i
had
paid
for
a
passage
in
the
i
had
done
no
such
thing
regarding
the
this
being
the
name
of
the
hulk
and
to
this
my
reply
the
said
little
but
i
perceived
that
he
liked
my
spirit
and
so
from
thence
until
we
reached
the
port
of
london
i
took
my
turn
and
part
in
all
seafaring
matters
having
become
by
this
quite
proficient
in
the
calling
yet
in
one
matter
i
availed
myself
of
my
former
position
for
i
chose
to
live
aft
and
by
this
was
abled
to
see
much
of
my
sweetheart
mistress
madison
now
after
dinner
upon
the
day
on
which
we
left
the
island
the
and
the
second
mate
picked
the
watches
and
thus
i
found
myself
chosen
to
be
in
the
at
which
i
was
mightly
pleased
and
when
the
watches
had
been
picked
they
had
all
hands
to
ship
the
which
to
the
pleasure
of
all
she
accomplished
for
under
such
gear
and
with
so
much
growth
upon
her
bottom
they
had
feared
that
we
should
have
to
veer
and
by
this
we
should
have
lost
much
distance
to
leeward
whereas
we
desired
to
edge
so
much
to
windward
as
we
could
being
anxious
to
put
space
between
us
and
the
and
twice
more
that
day
we
put
the
ship
about
though
the
second
time
it
was
to
avoid
a
great
bank
of
weed
that
lay
floating
athwart
our
bows
for
all
the
sea
to
windward
of
the
island
so
far
as
we
had
been
able
to
see
from
the
top
of
the
higher
hill
was
studded
with
floating
masses
of
the
weed
like
unto
thousands
of
islets
and
in
places
like
to
reefs
and
because
of
these
the
sea
all
about
the
island
remained
very
quiet
and
unbroken
so
that
there
was
never
any
surf
no
nor
scarce
a
broken
wave
upon
its
shore
and
this
for
all
that
the
wind
had
been
fresh
for
many
days
when
the
evening
came
we
were
again
upon
the
larboard
tack
making
perhaps
some
four
knots
in
the
hour
though
had
we
been
in
proper
rig
and
with
a
clean
bottom
we
had
been
making
eight
or
nine
with
so
good
a
breeze
and
so
calm
a
sea
yet
so
far
our
progress
had
been
very
reasonable
for
the
island
lay
maybe
some
five
miles
to
leeward
and
about
fifteen
astern
and
so
we
prepared
for
the
night
yet
a
little
before
dark
we
discovered
that
the
trended
out
towards
us
so
that
we
should
pass
it
maybe
at
a
distance
of
something
like
half
a
mile
and
at
that
there
was
talk
between
the
second
mate
and
the
as
to
whether
it
was
better
to
put
the
ship
about
and
gain
a
greater
before
attempting
to
pass
this
promontory
of
weed
but
at
last
they
decided
that
we
had
naught
to
fear
for
we
had
fair
way
through
the
water
and
further
it
did
not
seem
reasonable
to
suppose
that
we
should
have
aught
to
fear
from
the
habitants
of
the
at
so
great
a
distance
as
the
half
of
a
mile
and
so
we
stood
on
for
once
past
the
point
there
was
much
likelihood
of
the
weed
trending
away
to
the
eastward
and
if
this
were
so
we
could
immediately
and
get
the
wind
upon
our
quarter
and
so
make
better
way
now
it
was
the
watch
from
eight
of
the
evening
until
midnight
and
i
with
another
man
had
the
lookout
until
four
bells
thus
it
chanced
that
coming
abreast
of
the
point
during
our
time
of
watching
we
peered
very
earnestly
to
leeward
for
the
night
was
dark
having
no
moon
until
nearer
the
morning
and
we
were
full
of
unease
in
that
we
had
come
so
near
again
to
the
desolation
of
that
strange
continent
and
then
suddenly
the
man
with
me
clutched
my
shoulder
and
pointed
into
the
darkness
upon
our
bow
and
thus
i
discovered
that
we
had
come
nearer
to
the
weed
than
the
and
the
second
mate
had
intended
they
without
doubt
having
miscalculated
our
leeway
at
this
i
turned
and
sang
out
to
the
that
we
were
near
to
running
upon
the
weed
and
in
the
same
moment
he
shouted
to
the
helmsman
to
luff
and
directly
afterwards
our
starboard
side
was
brushing
against
the
great
outlying
tufts
of
the
point
and
so
for
a
breathless
minute
we
waited
yet
the
ship
drew
clear
and
so
into
the
open
water
beyond
the
point
but
i
had
seen
something
as
we
scraped
against
the
weed
a
sudden
glimpse
of
white
gliding
among
the
growth
and
then
i
saw
others
and
in
a
moment
i
was
down
on
the
and
running
aft
to
the
yet
midway
along
the
deck
a
horrid
shape
came
above
the
starboard
rail
and
i
gave
out
a
loud
cry
of
warning
then
i
had
a
from
the
rack
near
and
smote
with
it
at
the
thing
crying
all
the
while
for
help
and
at
my
blow
the
thing
went
from
my
sight
and
the
was
with
me
and
some
of
the
men
now
the
had
seen
my
stroke
and
so
sprang
upon
the
rail
and
peered
over
but
gave
back
on
the
instant
shouting
to
me
to
run
and
call
the
other
watch
for
that
the
sea
was
full
of
the
monsters
swimming
off
to
the
ship
and
at
that
i
was
away
at
a
run
and
when
i
had
waked
the
men
i
raced
aft
to
the
cabin
and
did
likewise
with
the
second
mate
and
so
returned
in
a
minute
bearing
the
cutlass
my
own
and
the
lantern
that
hung
always
in
the
saloon
now
when
i
had
gotten
back
i
found
all
things
in
a
mighty
scurry
men
running
about
in
their
shirts
and
drawers
some
in
the
galley
bringing
fire
from
the
stove
and
others
lighting
a
fire
of
dry
weed
to
leeward
of
the
galley
and
along
the
starboard
rail
there
was
already
a
fierce
fight
the
men
using
even
as
i
had
done
then
i
thrust
the
cutlass
into
his
hand
and
at
that
he
gave
a
great
shout
part
of
joy
and
part
of
approbation
and
after
that
he
snatched
the
lantern
from
me
and
had
run
to
the
larboard
side
of
the
deck
before
i
was
well
aware
that
he
had
taken
the
light
but
now
i
followed
him
and
happy
it
was
for
all
of
us
in
the
ship
that
he
had
thought
to
go
at
that
moment
for
the
light
of
the
lantern
showed
me
the
vile
faces
of
three
of
the
weed
men
climbing
over
the
larboard
rail
yet
the
had
cleft
them
or
ever
i
could
come
near
but
in
a
moment
i
was
full
busy
for
there
came
nigh
a
dozen
heads
above
the
rail
a
little
aft
of
where
i
was
and
at
that
i
ran
at
them
and
did
good
execution
but
some
had
been
aboard
if
the
had
not
come
to
my
help
and
now
the
decks
were
full
of
light
several
fires
having
been
lit
and
the
second
mate
having
brought
out
fresh
lanterns
and
now
the
men
had
gotten
their
cutlasses
the
which
were
more
handy
than
the
and
so
the
fight
went
forward
some
having
come
over
to
our
side
to
help
us
and
a
very
wild
sight
it
must
have
seemed
to
any
onlooker
for
all
about
the
decks
burned
the
fires
and
the
lanterns
and
along
the
rails
ran
the
men
smiting
at
hideous
faces
that
rose
in
dozens
into
the
wild
glare
of
our
fighting
lights
and
everywhere
drifted
the
stench
of
the
brutes
and
up
on
the
poop
the
fight
was
as
brisk
as
elsewhere
and
here
having
been
drawn
by
a
cry
for
help
i
discovered
the
buxom
woman
smiting
with
a
gory
at
a
vile
thing
which
had
gotten
a
clump
of
its
tentacles
upon
her
dress
but
she
had
dispatched
it
or
ever
my
sword
could
help
her
and
then
to
my
astonishment
even
at
that
time
of
peril
i
discovered
the
wife
wielding
a
small
sword
and
the
face
of
her
was
like
to
the
face
of
a
tiger
for
her
mouth
was
drawn
and
showed
her
teeth
clenched
but
she
uttered
no
word
nor
cry
and
i
doubt
not
but
that
she
had
some
vague
idea
that
she
worked
her
husband
vengeance
then
for
a
space
i
was
as
busy
as
any
and
afterwards
i
ran
to
the
buxom
woman
to
demand
the
whereabouts
of
mistress
madison
and
she
in
a
very
breathless
voice
informed
me
that
she
had
locked
her
in
her
room
out
of
harm
way
and
at
that
i
could
have
embraced
the
woman
for
i
had
been
sorely
anxious
to
know
that
my
sweetheart
was
safe
and
presently
the
fight
diminished
and
so
at
last
came
to
an
end
the
ship
having
drawn
well
away
from
the
point
and
being
now
in
the
open
and
after
that
i
ran
down
to
my
sweetheart
and
opened
her
door
and
thus
for
a
space
she
wept
having
her
arms
about
my
neck
for
she
had
been
in
sore
terror
for
me
and
for
all
the
ship
company
but
soon
drying
her
tears
she
grew
very
indignant
with
her
nurse
for
having
locked
her
into
her
room
and
refused
to
speak
to
that
good
woman
for
near
an
hour
yet
i
pointed
out
to
her
that
she
could
be
of
very
great
use
in
dressing
such
wounds
as
had
been
received
and
so
she
came
back
to
her
usual
brightness
and
brought
out
bandages
and
lint
and
ointment
and
thread
and
was
presently
very
busy
now
it
was
later
that
there
rose
a
fresh
commotion
in
the
ship
for
it
had
been
discovered
that
the
captain
wife
was
at
this
the
and
the
second
mate
instituted
a
search
but
she
was
nowhere
to
be
found
and
indeed
none
in
the
ship
ever
saw
her
again
at
which
it
was
presumed
that
she
had
been
dragged
over
by
some
of
the
weed
men
and
so
come
upon
her
death
and
at
this
there
came
a
great
prostration
to
my
sweetheart
so
that
she
would
not
be
comforted
for
the
space
of
nigh
three
days
by
which
time
the
ship
had
come
clear
of
those
strange
seas
having
left
the
incredible
desolation
of
the
far
under
our
starboard
counter
and
so
after
a
voyage
which
lasted
for
nine
and
seventy
days
since
getting
under
weigh
we
came
to
the
port
of
london
having
refused
all
offers
of
assistance
on
the
way
now
here
i
had
to
say
farewell
to
my
comrades
of
so
many
months
and
perilous
adventures
yet
being
a
man
not
entirely
without
means
i
took
care
that
each
of
them
should
have
a
certain
gift
by
which
to
remember
me
and
i
placed
monies
in
the
hands
of
the
buxom
woman
so
that
she
could
have
no
reason
to
stint
my
sweetheart
and
she
having
for
the
comfort
of
her
conscience
taken
her
good
man
to
the
church
set
up
a
little
house
upon
the
borders
of
my
estate
but
this
was
not
until
mistress
madison
had
come
to
take
her
place
at
the
head
of
my
hall
in
the
county
of
essex
now
one
further
thing
there
is
of
which
i
must
tell
should
any
chancing
to
trespass
upon
my
estate
come
upon
a
man
of
very
mighty
proportions
albeit
somewhat
bent
by
age
seated
comfortably
at
the
door
of
his
little
cottage
then
shall
they
know
him
for
my
friend
the
for
to
this
day
do
he
and
i
and
let
our
talk
drift
to
the
desolate
places
of
this
earth
pondering
upon
that
which
we
have
seen
the
where
reigns
desolation
and
the
terror
of
its
strange
habitants
and
after
that
we
talk
softly
of
the
land
where
god
hath
made
monsters
after
the
fashion
of
trees
then
maybe
my
children
come
about
me
and
so
we
change
to
other
matters
for
the
little
ones
love
not
terror
