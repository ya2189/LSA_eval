old
lady
mary
a
story
of
the
seen
and
the
unseen
by
margaret
o
wilson
oliphant
i
she
was
very
old
and
therefore
it
was
very
hard
for
her
to
make
up
her
mind
to
die
i
am
aware
that
this
is
not
at
all
the
general
view
but
that
it
is
believed
as
old
age
must
be
near
death
that
it
prepares
the
soul
for
that
inevitable
event
it
is
not
so
however
in
many
cases
in
youth
we
are
still
so
near
the
unseen
out
of
which
we
came
that
death
is
rather
pathetic
than
tragic
a
thing
that
touches
all
hearts
but
to
which
in
many
cases
the
young
hero
accommodates
himself
sweetly
and
courageously
and
amid
the
storms
and
burdens
of
middle
life
there
are
many
times
when
we
would
fain
push
open
the
door
that
stands
ajar
and
behind
which
there
is
ease
for
all
our
pains
or
at
least
rest
if
nothing
more
but
age
which
has
gone
through
both
these
phases
is
apt
out
of
long
custom
and
habit
to
regard
the
matter
from
a
different
view
all
things
that
are
violent
have
passed
out
of
its
life
no
more
strong
emotions
such
as
rend
the
heart
no
great
labors
bringing
after
them
the
weariness
which
is
unto
death
but
the
calm
of
an
existence
which
is
enough
for
its
needs
which
affords
the
moderate
amount
of
comfort
and
pleasure
for
which
its
being
is
now
adapted
and
of
which
there
seems
no
reason
that
there
should
ever
be
any
end
to
passion
to
joy
to
anguish
an
end
must
come
but
mere
gentle
living
determined
by
a
framework
of
gentle
rules
and
habits
why
should
that
ever
be
ended
when
a
soul
has
got
to
this
retirement
and
is
content
in
it
it
becomes
very
hard
to
die
hard
to
accept
the
necessity
of
dying
and
to
accustom
one
self
to
the
idea
and
still
harder
to
consent
to
carry
it
out
the
woman
who
is
the
subject
of
the
following
narrative
was
in
this
position
she
had
lived
through
almost
everything
that
is
to
be
found
in
life
she
had
been
beautiful
in
her
youth
and
had
enjoyed
all
the
triumphs
of
beauty
had
been
intoxicated
with
flattery
and
triumphant
in
conquest
and
mad
with
jealousy
and
the
bitterness
of
defeat
when
it
became
evident
that
her
day
was
over
she
had
never
been
a
bad
woman
or
false
or
unkind
but
she
had
thrown
herself
with
all
her
heart
into
those
different
stages
of
being
and
had
suffered
as
much
as
she
enjoyed
according
to
the
unfailing
usage
of
life
many
a
day
during
these
storms
and
victories
when
things
went
against
her
when
delights
did
not
satisfy
her
she
had
thrown
out
a
cry
into
the
wide
air
of
the
universe
and
wished
to
die
and
then
she
had
come
to
the
higher
of
life
and
had
borne
all
the
spites
of
fortune
had
been
poor
and
rich
and
happy
and
sorrowful
had
lost
and
won
a
hundred
times
over
had
sat
at
feasts
and
kneeled
by
deathbeds
and
followed
her
to
the
grave
often
often
crying
out
to
god
above
to
liberate
her
to
make
an
end
of
her
anguish
for
that
her
strength
was
exhausted
and
she
could
bear
no
more
but
she
had
borne
it
and
lived
through
all
and
now
had
arrived
at
a
time
when
all
strong
sensations
are
over
when
the
soul
is
no
longer
either
triumphant
or
miserable
and
when
life
itself
and
comfort
and
ease
and
the
warmth
of
the
sun
and
of
the
fireside
and
the
mild
beauty
of
home
were
enough
for
her
and
she
required
no
more
that
is
she
required
very
little
more
a
useful
routine
of
hours
and
rules
a
play
of
reflected
emotion
a
pleasant
exercise
of
faculty
making
her
feel
herself
still
capable
of
the
best
things
in
life
of
interest
in
her
kindness
to
them
and
a
little
gentle
intellectual
occupation
with
books
and
men
around
she
had
not
forgotten
anything
in
her
life
not
the
excitements
and
delights
of
her
beauty
nor
love
nor
grief
nor
the
higher
levels
she
had
touched
in
her
day
she
did
not
forget
the
dark
day
when
her
was
laid
in
the
grave
nor
that
triumphant
and
brilliant
climax
of
her
life
when
every
one
pointed
to
her
as
the
mother
of
a
hero
all
these
things
were
like
pictures
hung
in
the
secret
chambers
of
her
mind
to
which
she
could
go
back
in
silent
moments
in
the
twilight
seated
by
the
fire
or
in
the
balmy
afternoon
when
languor
and
sweet
thoughts
are
over
the
world
sometimes
at
such
moments
there
would
be
heard
from
her
a
faint
sob
called
forth
it
was
quite
as
likely
by
the
recollection
of
the
triumph
as
by
that
of
the
deathbed
with
these
pictures
to
go
back
upon
at
her
will
she
was
never
dull
but
saw
herself
moving
through
the
various
scenes
of
her
life
with
a
continual
sympathy
feeling
for
herself
in
all
her
troubles
sometimes
approving
sometimes
judging
that
woman
who
had
been
so
pretty
so
happy
so
miserable
and
had
gone
through
everything
that
life
can
go
through
how
much
that
is
looking
back
upon
it
passages
so
hard
that
the
wonder
was
how
she
could
survive
them
pangs
so
terrible
that
the
heart
would
seem
at
its
last
gasp
but
yet
would
revive
and
go
on
besides
these
however
she
had
many
mild
pleasures
she
had
a
pretty
house
full
of
things
which
formed
a
graceful
suitable
as
she
felt
for
such
a
woman
as
she
was
and
in
which
she
took
pleasure
for
their
own
beauty
soft
chairs
and
couches
a
fireplace
and
lights
which
were
the
perfection
of
tempered
warmth
and
illumination
she
had
a
carriage
very
comfortable
and
easy
in
which
when
the
weather
was
suitable
she
went
out
and
a
pretty
garden
and
lawns
in
which
when
she
preferred
staying
at
home
she
could
have
her
little
walk
or
sit
out
under
the
trees
she
had
books
in
plenty
and
all
the
newspapers
and
everything
that
was
needful
to
keep
her
within
the
reflection
of
the
busy
life
which
she
no
longer
cared
to
encounter
in
her
own
person
the
post
rarely
brought
her
painful
letters
for
all
those
impassioned
interests
which
bring
pain
had
died
out
and
the
sorrows
of
others
when
they
were
communicated
to
her
gave
her
a
luxurious
sense
of
sympathy
yet
exemption
she
was
sorry
for
them
but
such
catastrophes
could
touch
her
no
more
and
often
she
had
pleasant
letters
which
afforded
her
something
to
talk
and
think
about
and
discuss
as
if
it
concerned
her
and
yet
did
not
concern
her
business
which
could
not
hurt
her
if
it
failed
which
would
please
her
if
it
succeeded
her
letters
her
papers
her
books
each
coming
at
its
appointed
hour
were
all
instruments
of
pleasure
she
came
at
a
certain
hour
which
she
kept
to
as
if
it
had
been
of
the
utmost
importance
although
it
was
of
no
importance
at
all
she
took
just
so
much
good
wine
so
many
cups
of
tea
her
repasts
were
as
regular
as
clockwork
never
too
late
never
too
early
her
whole
life
went
on
velvet
rolling
smoothly
along
without
jar
or
interruption
blameless
pleasant
kind
people
talked
of
her
old
age
as
a
model
of
old
age
with
no
bitterness
or
sourness
in
it
and
indeed
why
should
she
have
been
sour
or
bitter
it
suited
her
far
better
to
be
kind
she
was
in
reality
kind
to
everybody
liking
to
see
pleasant
faces
about
her
the
poor
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
her
her
servants
were
very
comfortable
and
the
one
person
in
her
house
who
was
nearer
to
her
own
level
who
was
her
companion
and
most
important
minister
was
very
comfortable
too
this
was
a
young
woman
about
twenty
a
very
distant
relation
with
no
claim
everybody
said
upon
her
kind
mistress
and
friend
the
daughter
of
a
distant
cousin
how
very
few
think
anything
at
all
of
such
a
tie
but
lady
mary
had
taken
her
young
namesake
when
she
was
a
child
and
she
had
grown
up
as
it
were
at
her
footstool
in
the
conviction
that
the
measured
existence
of
the
old
was
the
rule
of
life
and
that
her
own
trifling
personality
counted
for
nothing
or
next
to
nothing
in
its
steady
progress
her
name
was
mary
too
always
called
little
mary
as
having
once
been
little
and
not
yet
very
much
in
the
matter
of
size
she
was
one
of
the
pleasantest
things
to
look
at
of
all
the
pretty
things
in
lady
mary
rooms
and
she
had
the
most
sheltered
peaceful
and
pleasant
life
that
could
be
conceived
the
only
little
thorn
in
her
pillow
was
that
whereas
in
the
novels
of
which
she
read
a
great
many
the
heroines
all
go
and
pay
visits
and
have
adventures
she
had
none
but
lived
constantly
at
home
there
was
something
much
more
serious
in
her
life
had
she
known
which
was
that
she
had
nothing
and
no
power
of
doing
anything
for
herself
that
she
had
all
her
life
been
accustomed
to
a
modest
luxury
which
would
make
poverty
very
hard
to
her
and
that
lady
mary
was
over
eighty
and
had
made
no
will
if
she
did
not
make
any
will
her
property
would
all
go
to
her
grandson
who
was
so
rich
already
that
her
fortune
would
be
but
as
a
drop
in
the
ocean
to
him
or
to
some
of
whom
she
knew
very
little
the
descendants
of
a
daughter
long
ago
dead
who
had
married
an
austrian
and
who
were
therefore
foreigners
both
in
birth
and
name
that
she
should
provide
for
little
mary
was
therefore
a
thing
which
nature
demanded
and
which
would
hurt
nobody
she
had
said
so
often
but
she
deferred
the
doing
of
it
as
a
thing
for
which
there
was
no
hurry
for
why
should
she
die
there
seemed
no
reason
or
need
for
it
so
long
as
she
lived
nothing
could
be
more
sure
more
happy
and
serene
than
little
mary
life
and
why
should
she
die
she
did
not
perhaps
put
this
into
words
but
the
meaning
of
her
smile
and
the
manner
in
which
she
put
aside
every
suggestion
about
the
chances
of
the
hereafter
away
from
her
said
it
more
clearly
than
words
it
was
not
that
she
had
any
superstitious
fear
about
the
making
of
a
will
when
the
doctor
or
the
vicar
or
her
man
of
business
the
only
persons
who
ever
talked
to
her
on
the
subject
ventured
periodically
to
refer
to
it
she
assented
pleasantly
yes
certainly
she
must
do
it
some
time
or
other
it
is
a
very
simple
thing
to
do
the
lawyer
said
i
will
save
you
all
trouble
nothing
but
your
signature
will
be
wanted
and
that
you
give
every
day
oh
i
should
think
nothing
of
the
trouble
she
said
and
it
would
liberate
your
mind
from
all
care
and
leave
you
free
to
think
of
things
more
important
still
said
the
clergyman
i
think
i
am
very
free
of
care
she
replied
then
the
doctor
added
bluntly
and
you
will
not
die
an
hour
the
sooner
for
having
made
your
will
die
said
lady
mary
surprised
and
then
she
added
with
a
smile
i
hope
you
do
think
so
little
of
me
as
to
believe
i
would
be
kept
back
by
that
these
gentlemen
all
consulted
together
in
despair
and
asked
each
other
what
should
be
done
they
thought
her
an
egotist
a
old
woman
holding
at
arm
length
any
idea
of
the
inevitable
and
so
she
did
but
not
because
she
was
because
she
was
so
accustomed
to
living
and
had
survived
so
many
calamities
and
gone
on
so
long
so
long
and
because
everything
was
so
comfortably
arranged
about
her
all
her
little
habits
so
firmly
established
as
if
nothing
could
interfere
with
them
to
think
of
the
day
arriving
which
should
begin
with
some
other
formula
than
that
of
her
maid
entrance
drawing
aside
the
curtains
lighting
the
cheerful
fire
bringing
her
a
report
of
the
weather
and
then
the
little
tray
resplendent
with
snowy
linen
and
shining
silver
and
china
with
its
bouquet
of
violets
or
a
rose
in
the
season
the
newspaper
carefully
dried
and
cut
the
letters
every
detail
was
so
perfect
so
unchanging
regular
as
the
morning
it
seemed
impossible
that
it
should
come
to
an
end
and
then
when
she
came
downstairs
there
were
all
the
little
articles
upon
her
table
always
ready
to
her
hand
a
certain
number
of
things
to
do
each
at
the
appointed
hour
the
slender
refreshments
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
take
in
which
there
was
a
little
exquisite
variety
but
never
any
change
in
the
fact
that
at
eleven
and
at
three
and
so
forth
something
had
to
be
taken
had
a
woman
wanted
to
abandon
the
peaceful
life
which
was
thus
supported
and
carried
on
the
very
framework
itself
would
have
resisted
it
was
impossible
almost
to
contemplate
the
idea
that
at
a
given
moment
the
whole
machinery
must
stop
she
was
neither
without
heart
nor
without
religion
but
on
the
contrary
a
good
woman
to
whom
many
gentle
thoughts
had
been
given
at
various
portions
of
her
career
but
the
occasion
seemed
to
have
passed
for
that
as
well
as
other
kinds
of
emotion
the
mere
fact
of
living
was
enough
for
her
the
little
exertion
which
it
was
well
she
was
required
to
make
produced
a
pleasant
weariness
it
was
a
duty
much
enforced
upon
her
by
all
around
her
that
she
should
do
nothing
which
would
exhaust
or
fatigue
i
do
want
you
to
think
even
the
doctor
would
say
you
have
done
enough
of
thinking
in
your
time
and
this
she
accepted
with
great
composure
of
spirit
she
had
thought
and
felt
and
done
much
in
her
day
but
now
everything
of
the
kind
was
over
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
fatigue
herself
and
day
followed
day
all
warm
and
sheltered
and
pleasant
people
died
it
is
true
now
and
then
out
of
doors
but
they
were
mostly
young
people
whose
death
might
have
been
prevented
had
proper
care
been
taken
who
were
seized
with
violent
maladies
or
caught
sudden
infections
or
were
cut
down
by
accident
all
which
things
seemed
natural
her
own
contemporaries
were
very
few
and
they
were
like
herself
living
on
in
something
of
the
same
way
at
all
people
under
seventy
are
young
and
one
contemporaries
are
very
very
few
nevertheless
these
men
did
disturb
her
a
little
about
her
will
she
had
made
more
than
one
will
in
the
former
days
during
her
active
life
but
all
those
to
whom
she
had
bequeathed
her
possessions
were
dead
she
had
survived
them
all
and
inherited
from
many
of
them
which
had
been
a
hard
thing
in
its
time
one
day
the
lawyer
had
been
more
than
ordinarily
pressing
he
had
told
her
stories
of
men
who
had
died
intestate
and
left
trouble
and
penury
behind
them
to
those
whom
they
would
have
most
wished
to
preserve
from
all
trouble
it
would
not
have
become
furnival
to
say
brutally
to
lady
mary
this
is
how
you
will
leave
your
godchild
when
you
die
but
he
told
her
story
after
story
many
of
them
piteous
enough
people
think
it
is
so
troublesome
a
business
he
said
when
it
is
nothing
at
all
the
most
easy
matter
in
the
world
we
are
getting
so
much
less
particular
nowadays
about
formalities
so
long
as
the
testator
intentions
are
made
quite
apparent
that
is
the
chief
matter
and
a
very
bad
thing
for
us
lawyers
i
dare
say
said
lady
mary
it
is
unpleasant
for
a
man
to
think
of
himself
as
testator
it
is
a
very
abstract
title
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
pooh
said
furnival
who
had
no
sense
of
humor
but
if
this
great
business
is
so
very
simple
she
went
on
one
could
do
it
no
doubt
for
one
self
many
people
do
but
it
is
never
advisable
said
the
lawyer
you
will
say
it
is
natural
for
me
to
tell
you
that
when
they
do
it
should
be
as
simple
as
possible
i
give
all
my
real
property
or
my
personal
property
or
my
share
in
or
my
jewels
or
so
forth
to
whoever
it
may
be
the
fewer
words
the
better
so
that
nobody
may
be
able
to
read
between
the
lines
you
know
and
the
signature
attested
by
two
witnesses
but
they
must
not
be
witnesses
that
have
any
interest
that
is
that
have
anything
left
to
them
by
the
document
they
witness
lady
mary
put
up
her
hand
defensively
with
a
laugh
it
was
still
a
most
delicate
hand
like
ivory
a
little
yellowed
with
age
but
fine
the
veins
standing
out
a
little
upon
it
the
still
pink
you
speak
she
said
as
if
you
expected
me
to
take
the
law
in
my
own
hands
no
no
my
old
friend
never
fear
you
shall
have
the
doing
of
it
whenever
you
please
my
dear
lady
whenever
you
please
such
a
thing
can
not
be
done
an
hour
too
soon
shall
i
take
your
instructions
now
lady
mary
laughed
and
said
you
were
always
a
very
keen
man
for
business
i
remember
your
father
used
to
say
robert
would
never
neglect
an
opening
no
he
said
with
a
peculiar
look
i
have
always
looked
after
my
and
in
that
case
it
is
true
the
pounds
take
care
of
themselves
very
good
care
said
lady
mary
and
then
she
bade
her
young
companion
bring
that
book
she
had
been
reading
where
there
was
something
she
wanted
to
show
furnival
it
is
only
a
case
in
a
novel
but
i
am
sure
it
is
bad
law
give
me
your
opinion
she
said
he
was
obliged
to
be
civil
very
civil
nobody
is
rude
to
the
lady
marys
of
life
and
besides
she
was
old
enough
to
have
an
additional
right
to
every
courtesy
but
while
he
sat
over
the
novel
and
tried
with
unnecessary
vehemence
to
make
her
see
what
very
bad
law
it
was
and
glanced
from
her
smiling
attention
to
the
innocent
sweetness
of
the
girl
beside
her
who
was
her
loving
attendant
the
good
man
heart
was
sore
he
said
many
hard
things
of
her
in
his
own
mind
as
he
went
away
she
will
die
he
said
bitterly
she
will
go
off
in
a
moment
when
nobody
is
looking
for
it
and
that
poor
child
will
be
left
destitute
it
was
all
he
could
do
not
to
go
back
and
take
her
by
her
fragile
old
shoulders
and
force
her
to
sign
and
seal
at
once
but
then
he
knew
very
well
that
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
in
her
presence
he
would
of
necessity
be
obliged
to
subdue
his
impatience
and
be
once
more
civil
very
civil
and
try
to
suggest
and
insinuate
the
duty
which
he
dared
not
force
upon
her
and
it
was
very
clear
that
till
she
pleased
she
would
take
no
hint
he
supposed
it
must
be
that
strange
reluctance
to
part
with
their
power
which
is
said
to
be
common
to
old
people
or
else
that
horror
of
death
and
determination
to
keep
it
at
arm
length
which
is
also
common
thus
he
did
as
spectators
are
so
apt
to
do
he
forced
a
meaning
and
motive
into
what
had
no
motive
at
all
and
imagined
lady
mary
the
kindest
of
women
to
be
of
purpose
and
intention
risking
the
future
of
the
girl
whom
she
had
brought
up
and
whom
she
loved
not
with
passion
indeed
or
anxiety
but
with
tender
benevolence
a
theory
which
was
as
false
as
anything
could
be
that
evening
in
her
room
lady
mary
in
a
very
cheerful
mood
sat
by
a
little
bright
unnecessary
fire
with
her
before
her
waiting
till
she
should
be
sleepy
it
was
the
only
point
in
which
she
was
a
little
hard
upon
her
maid
who
in
every
other
respect
was
the
of
servants
lady
mary
as
it
happened
had
often
no
inclination
for
bed
till
the
night
was
far
advanced
she
slept
little
as
is
common
enough
at
her
age
she
was
in
her
warm
wadded
an
article
in
which
she
still
showed
certain
traces
which
were
indeed
visible
in
all
she
wore
of
her
ancient
beauty
with
her
white
hair
becomingly
arranged
under
a
cap
of
cambric
and
lace
at
the
last
moment
when
she
had
been
ready
to
step
into
bed
she
had
changed
her
mind
and
told
jervis
that
she
would
write
a
letter
or
two
first
and
she
had
written
her
letters
but
still
felt
no
inclination
to
sleep
then
there
fluttered
across
her
memory
somehow
the
conversation
she
had
held
with
furnival
in
the
morning
it
would
be
amusing
she
thought
to
cheat
him
out
of
some
of
those
he
pretended
to
think
so
much
of
it
would
be
still
more
amusing
next
time
the
subject
of
her
will
was
recurred
to
to
give
his
arm
a
little
tap
with
her
fan
and
say
oh
that
is
all
settled
months
ago
she
laughed
to
herself
at
this
and
took
out
a
fresh
sheet
of
paper
it
was
a
little
jest
that
pleased
her
do
you
think
there
is
any
one
up
yet
jervis
except
you
and
me
she
said
to
the
maid
jervis
hesitated
a
little
and
then
said
that
she
believed
brown
had
not
gone
to
bed
yet
for
he
had
been
going
over
the
cellar
and
was
making
up
his
accounts
jervis
was
so
explanatory
that
her
mistress
divined
what
was
meant
i
suppose
i
have
been
spoiling
sport
keeping
you
here
she
said
for
it
was
well
known
that
miss
jervis
and
brown
were
engaged
and
that
they
were
only
waiting
everybody
knew
but
lady
mary
who
never
suspected
it
the
death
of
their
mistress
to
set
up
a
in
jermyn
street
where
they
fully
intended
to
make
their
fortune
then
go
lady
mary
said
and
call
brown
i
have
a
little
business
paper
to
write
and
you
must
both
witness
my
signature
she
laughed
to
herself
a
little
as
she
said
this
thinking
how
she
would
steel
a
march
on
furnival
i
give
and
bequeath
she
said
to
herself
playfully
after
jervis
had
hurried
away
she
fully
intended
to
leave
both
of
these
good
servants
something
but
then
she
recollected
that
people
who
are
interested
in
a
will
can
not
sign
as
witnesses
what
does
it
matter
she
said
to
herself
gayly
if
it
ever
should
be
wanted
mary
would
see
to
that
accordingly
she
dashed
off
in
her
pretty
handwriting
which
was
very
angular
and
pointed
as
was
the
fashion
in
her
day
and
still
very
clear
though
slightly
tremulous
a
few
lines
in
which
remembering
playfully
furnival
recommendation
of
few
words
she
left
to
little
mary
all
she
possessed
adding
by
the
prompting
of
that
recollection
about
the
witnesses
she
will
take
care
of
the
servants
it
filled
one
side
only
of
the
large
sheet
of
notepaper
which
was
what
lady
mary
habitually
used
brown
introduced
timidly
by
jervis
and
a
little
overawed
by
the
solemnity
of
the
bedchamber
came
in
and
painted
solidly
his
large
signature
after
the
spidery
lines
of
his
mistress
she
had
folded
down
the
paper
so
that
neither
saw
what
it
was
now
i
will
go
to
bed
lady
mary
said
when
brown
had
left
the
room
and
jervis
you
must
go
to
bed
too
yes
my
lady
said
jervis
i
do
approve
of
courtship
at
this
hour
no
my
lady
jervis
replied
deprecating
and
disappointed
why
can
not
he
tell
his
tale
in
daylight
oh
my
lady
there
no
tale
to
tell
cried
the
maid
we
are
not
of
the
gossiping
sort
my
lady
neither
me
nor
mr
brown
lady
mary
laughed
and
watched
while
the
candles
were
put
out
the
fire
made
a
pleasant
flicker
in
the
room
it
was
autumn
and
still
warm
and
it
was
for
company
and
cheerfulness
that
the
little
fire
was
lit
she
liked
to
see
it
dancing
and
flickering
upon
the
walls
and
then
closed
her
eyes
amid
an
exquisite
softness
of
comfort
and
luxury
life
itself
bearing
her
up
as
softly
filling
up
all
the
crevices
as
warmly
as
the
downy
pillow
upon
which
she
rested
her
still
beautiful
old
head
if
she
had
died
that
night
the
little
sheet
of
paper
that
meant
so
much
lay
openly
innocently
in
her
along
with
the
letters
she
had
written
and
looking
of
as
little
importance
as
they
there
was
nobody
in
the
world
who
grudged
old
lady
mary
one
of
those
pretty
placid
days
of
hers
brown
and
jervis
if
they
were
sometimes
a
little
impatient
consoled
each
other
that
they
were
both
sure
of
something
in
her
will
and
that
in
the
mean
time
it
was
a
very
good
place
and
all
the
rest
would
have
been
very
well
content
that
lady
mary
should
live
forever
but
how
wonderfully
it
would
have
simplified
everything
and
how
much
trouble
and
pain
it
would
have
saved
to
everybody
herself
included
could
she
have
died
that
night
but
naturally
there
was
no
question
of
dying
on
that
night
when
she
was
about
to
go
downstairs
next
day
lady
mary
giving
her
letters
to
be
posted
saw
the
paper
she
had
forgotten
lying
beside
them
she
had
forgotten
all
about
it
but
the
sight
of
it
made
her
smile
she
folded
it
up
and
put
it
in
an
envelope
while
jervis
went
with
the
letters
and
then
to
carry
out
her
joke
she
looked
round
her
to
see
where
she
would
put
it
there
was
an
old
italian
cabinet
in
the
room
with
a
secret
drawer
which
it
was
a
little
difficult
to
open
almost
impossible
for
any
one
who
did
not
know
the
secret
lady
mary
looked
round
her
smiled
hesitated
a
little
and
then
walked
across
the
room
and
put
the
envelope
in
the
secret
drawer
she
was
still
fumbling
with
it
when
jervis
came
back
but
there
was
no
connection
in
jervis
mind
then
or
ever
after
between
the
paper
she
had
signed
and
this
old
cabinet
which
was
one
of
the
old
lady
toys
she
arranged
lady
mary
shawl
which
had
dropped
off
her
shoulders
a
little
in
her
unusual
activity
and
took
up
her
book
and
her
favorite
cushion
and
all
the
little
paraphernalia
that
moved
with
her
and
gave
her
lady
her
arm
to
go
where
little
mary
had
placed
her
chair
just
at
the
right
angle
and
arranged
the
little
table
on
which
there
were
so
many
little
necessaries
and
conveniences
and
was
standing
smiling
the
prettiest
object
of
all
the
climax
of
the
gentle
luxury
and
pleasantness
to
receive
her
godmother
who
had
been
her
providence
all
her
life
but
what
a
pity
oh
what
a
pity
that
she
had
not
died
that
night
ii
life
went
on
after
this
without
any
change
there
was
never
any
change
in
that
delightful
house
and
if
it
was
years
or
months
or
even
days
the
youngest
of
its
inhabitants
could
scarcely
tell
and
lady
mary
could
not
tell
at
all
this
was
one
of
her
little
imperfections
a
little
mist
which
hung
like
the
lace
about
her
head
over
her
memory
she
could
not
remember
how
time
went
or
that
there
was
any
difference
between
one
day
and
another
there
were
sundays
it
was
true
which
made
a
kind
of
gentle
measure
of
the
progress
of
time
but
she
said
with
a
smile
that
she
thought
it
was
always
sunday
they
came
so
close
upon
each
other
and
time
flew
on
gentle
wings
that
made
no
sound
and
left
no
reminders
she
had
her
little
ailments
like
anybody
but
in
reality
less
than
anybody
seeing
there
was
nothing
to
fret
her
nothing
to
disturb
the
even
tenor
of
her
days
still
there
were
times
when
she
took
a
little
cold
or
got
a
chill
in
spite
of
all
precautions
as
she
went
from
one
room
to
another
she
came
to
be
one
of
the
marvels
of
the
time
an
old
lady
who
had
seen
everybody
worth
seeing
for
generations
back
who
remembered
as
distinctly
as
if
they
had
happened
yesterday
great
events
that
had
taken
place
before
the
present
age
began
at
all
before
the
great
statesmen
of
our
time
were
born
and
in
full
possession
of
all
her
faculties
as
everybody
said
her
mind
as
clear
as
ever
her
intelligence
as
active
reading
everything
interested
in
everything
and
still
beautiful
in
extreme
old
age
everybody
about
her
and
in
particular
all
the
people
who
helped
to
keep
the
thorns
from
her
path
and
felt
themselves
to
have
a
hand
in
her
preservation
were
proud
of
lady
mary
and
she
was
perhaps
a
little
a
very
little
delightfully
charmingly
proud
of
herself
the
doctor
beguiled
by
professional
vanity
feeling
what
a
feather
she
was
in
his
cap
quite
confident
that
she
would
reach
her
hundredth
birthday
and
with
an
ecstatic
hope
that
even
by
grace
of
his
admirable
treatment
and
her
own
beautiful
constitution
she
might
almost
solve
the
problem
and
live
forever
gave
up
troubling
about
the
will
which
at
a
former
period
he
had
taken
so
much
interest
in
what
is
the
use
he
said
she
will
see
us
all
out
and
the
vicar
though
he
did
not
give
in
to
this
was
overawed
by
the
old
lady
who
knew
everything
that
could
be
taught
her
and
to
whom
it
seemed
an
impertinence
to
utter
commonplaces
about
duty
or
even
to
suggest
subjects
of
thought
furnival
was
the
only
man
who
did
not
cease
his
representations
and
whose
anxiety
about
the
young
mary
who
was
so
blooming
and
sweet
in
the
shadow
of
the
old
did
not
decrease
but
the
recollection
of
the
bit
of
paper
in
the
secret
drawer
of
the
cabinet
fortified
his
old
client
against
all
his
attacks
she
had
intended
it
only
as
a
jest
with
which
some
day
or
other
to
confound
him
and
show
how
much
wiser
she
was
than
he
supposed
it
became
quite
a
pleasant
subject
of
thought
to
her
at
which
she
laughed
to
herself
some
day
when
she
had
a
suitable
moment
she
would
order
him
to
come
with
all
his
formalities
and
then
produce
her
bit
of
paper
and
turn
the
laugh
against
him
but
oddly
the
very
existence
of
that
little
document
kept
her
indifferent
even
to
the
laugh
it
was
too
much
trouble
she
only
smiled
at
him
and
took
no
more
notice
amused
to
think
how
astonished
he
would
be
when
if
ever
he
found
it
out
it
happened
however
that
one
day
in
the
early
winter
the
wind
changed
when
lady
mary
was
out
for
her
drive
at
least
they
all
vowed
the
wind
changed
it
was
in
the
south
that
genial
quarter
when
she
set
out
but
turned
about
in
some
uncomfortable
way
and
was
a
keen
northeaster
when
she
came
back
and
in
the
moment
of
stepping
from
the
carriage
she
caught
a
chill
it
was
the
coachman
fault
jervis
said
who
allowed
the
horses
to
make
a
step
forward
when
lady
mary
was
getting
out
and
kept
her
exposed
standing
on
the
step
of
the
carriage
while
he
pulled
them
up
and
it
was
jervis
fault
the
footman
said
who
was
not
clever
enough
to
get
her
lady
out
or
even
to
throw
a
shawl
round
her
when
she
perceived
how
the
weather
had
changed
it
is
always
some
one
fault
or
some
unforeseen
unprecedented
change
that
does
it
at
the
last
lady
mary
was
not
accustomed
to
be
ill
and
did
not
bear
it
with
her
usual
grace
she
was
a
little
impatient
at
first
and
thought
they
were
making
an
unnecessary
fuss
but
then
there
passed
a
few
uncomfortable
feverish
days
when
she
began
to
look
forward
to
the
doctor
visit
as
the
only
thing
there
was
any
comfort
in
afterwards
she
passed
a
night
of
a
very
agitating
kind
she
dozed
and
dreamed
and
awoke
and
dreamed
again
her
life
seemed
all
to
run
into
dreams
a
strange
confusion
was
about
her
through
which
she
could
define
nothing
once
waking
up
as
she
supposed
she
saw
a
group
round
her
bed
the
doctor
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
how
should
the
doctor
be
there
in
the
middle
of
the
night
holding
her
hand
or
feeling
her
pulse
little
mary
at
one
side
crying
why
should
the
child
cry
and
jervis
very
anxious
pouring
something
into
a
glass
there
were
other
faces
there
which
she
was
sure
must
have
come
out
of
a
dream
so
unlikely
was
it
that
they
should
be
collected
in
her
bedchamber
and
all
with
a
sort
of
halo
of
feverish
light
about
them
a
magnified
and
mysterious
importance
this
strange
scene
which
she
did
not
understand
seemed
to
make
itself
visible
all
in
a
moment
out
of
the
darkness
and
then
disappeared
again
as
suddenly
as
it
came
iii
when
she
woke
again
it
was
morning
and
her
first
waking
consciousness
was
that
she
must
be
much
better
the
choking
sensation
in
her
throat
was
altogether
gone
she
had
no
desire
to
cough
no
difficulty
in
breathing
she
had
a
fancy
however
that
she
must
be
still
dreaming
for
she
felt
sure
that
some
one
had
called
her
by
her
name
mary
now
all
who
could
call
her
by
her
christian
name
were
dead
years
ago
therefore
it
must
be
a
dream
however
in
a
short
time
it
was
repeated
mary
mary
get
up
there
is
a
great
deal
to
do
this
voice
confused
her
greatly
was
it
possible
that
all
that
was
past
had
been
mere
fancy
that
she
had
but
dreamed
those
long
long
years
maturity
and
motherhood
and
trouble
and
triumph
and
old
age
at
the
end
of
all
it
seemed
to
her
possible
that
she
might
have
dreamed
the
rest
for
she
had
been
a
girl
much
given
to
visions
but
she
said
to
herself
that
she
never
could
have
dreamed
old
age
and
then
with
a
smile
she
mused
and
thought
that
it
must
be
the
voice
that
was
a
dream
for
how
could
she
get
up
without
jervis
who
had
never
appeared
yet
to
draw
the
curtains
or
make
the
fire
jervis
perhaps
had
sat
up
late
she
remembered
now
to
have
seen
her
that
time
in
the
middle
of
the
night
by
her
bedside
so
that
it
was
natural
enough
poor
thing
that
she
should
be
late
get
up
who
was
it
that
was
calling
to
her
so
she
had
not
been
so
called
to
she
who
had
always
been
a
great
lady
since
she
was
a
girl
by
her
mother
side
mary
mary
it
was
a
very
curious
dream
and
what
was
more
curious
still
was
that
she
could
not
keep
still
any
longer
but
got
up
without
thinking
any
more
of
jervis
and
going
out
of
her
room
came
all
at
once
into
the
midst
of
a
company
of
people
all
very
busy
whom
she
was
much
surprised
to
find
at
first
but
whom
she
soon
accustomed
herself
to
finding
the
greatest
interest
in
their
proceedings
and
curious
to
know
what
they
were
doing
they
for
their
part
did
not
seem
at
all
surprised
by
her
appearance
nor
did
any
one
stop
to
explain
as
would
have
been
natural
but
she
took
this
with
great
composure
somewhat
astonished
perhaps
being
used
wherever
she
went
to
a
great
many
observances
and
much
respect
but
soon
very
soon
becoming
used
to
it
then
some
one
repeated
what
she
had
heard
before
it
is
time
you
got
up
for
there
is
a
great
deal
to
do
to
do
she
said
for
me
and
then
she
looked
round
upon
them
with
that
charming
smile
which
had
subjugated
so
many
i
am
afraid
she
said
you
will
find
me
of
very
little
use
i
am
too
old
now
if
ever
i
could
have
done
much
for
work
oh
no
you
are
not
old
you
will
do
very
well
some
one
said
not
old
lady
mary
felt
a
little
offended
in
spite
of
herself
perhaps
i
like
flattery
as
well
as
my
neighbors
she
said
with
dignity
but
then
it
must
be
reasonable
to
say
i
am
anything
but
a
very
old
woman
here
she
paused
a
little
perceiving
for
the
first
time
with
surprise
that
she
was
standing
and
walking
without
her
stick
or
the
help
of
any
one
arm
quite
freely
and
at
her
ease
and
that
the
place
in
which
she
was
had
expanded
into
a
great
place
like
a
gallery
in
a
palace
instead
of
the
room
next
her
own
into
which
she
had
walked
a
few
minutes
ago
but
this
discovery
did
not
at
all
affect
her
mind
or
occupy
her
except
with
the
most
passing
momentary
surprise
the
fact
is
i
feel
a
great
deal
better
and
stronger
she
said
quite
well
mary
and
stronger
than
ever
you
were
before
who
is
it
that
calls
me
mary
i
have
had
nobody
for
a
long
time
to
call
me
mary
the
friends
of
my
youth
are
all
dead
i
think
that
you
must
be
right
although
the
doctor
i
feel
sure
thought
me
very
bad
last
night
i
should
have
got
alarmed
if
i
had
not
fallen
asleep
again
and
then
woke
up
well
quite
well
it
is
wonderful
but
quite
true
you
seem
to
know
a
great
deal
about
me
i
know
everything
about
you
you
have
had
a
very
pleasant
life
and
do
you
think
you
have
made
the
best
of
it
your
old
age
has
been
very
pleasant
ah
you
acknowledge
that
i
am
old
then
cried
lady
mary
with
a
smile
you
are
old
no
longer
and
you
are
a
great
lady
no
longer
do
you
see
that
something
has
happened
to
you
it
is
seldom
that
such
a
great
change
happens
without
being
found
out
yes
it
is
true
i
have
got
better
all
at
once
i
feel
an
extraordinary
renewal
of
strength
i
seem
to
have
left
home
without
knowing
it
none
of
my
people
seem
near
me
i
feel
very
much
as
if
i
had
just
awakened
from
a
long
dream
is
it
possible
she
said
with
a
wondering
look
that
i
have
dreamed
all
my
life
and
after
all
am
just
a
girl
at
home
the
idea
was
ludicrous
and
she
laughed
you
see
i
am
very
much
improved
indeed
she
said
she
was
still
so
far
from
perceiving
the
real
situation
that
some
one
came
towards
her
out
of
the
group
of
people
about
some
one
whom
she
recognized
with
the
evident
intention
of
explaining
to
her
how
it
was
she
started
a
little
at
the
sight
of
him
and
held
out
her
hand
and
cried
you
here
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
doubly
glad
since
i
was
told
a
few
days
ago
that
you
had
died
there
was
something
in
this
word
as
she
herself
pronounced
it
that
troubled
her
a
little
she
had
never
been
one
of
those
who
are
afraid
of
death
on
the
contrary
she
had
always
taken
a
great
interest
in
it
and
liked
to
hear
everything
that
could
be
told
her
on
the
subject
it
gave
her
now
however
a
curious
little
thrill
of
sensation
which
she
did
not
understand
she
hoped
it
was
not
superstition
you
have
guessed
rightly
he
said
quite
right
that
is
one
of
the
words
with
a
false
meaning
which
is
to
us
a
mere
symbol
of
something
we
can
not
understand
but
you
see
what
it
means
now
it
was
a
great
shock
it
need
not
be
concealed
otherwise
she
had
been
quite
pleasantly
occupied
with
the
interest
of
something
new
into
which
she
had
walked
so
easily
out
of
her
own
bedchamber
without
any
trouble
and
with
the
delightful
new
sensation
of
health
and
strength
but
when
it
flashed
upon
her
that
she
was
not
to
go
back
to
her
bedroom
again
nor
have
any
of
those
cares
and
attentions
which
had
seemed
necessary
to
existence
she
was
very
much
startled
and
shaken
died
was
it
possible
that
she
personally
had
died
she
had
known
it
was
a
thing
that
happened
to
everybody
but
yet
and
it
was
a
solemn
matter
to
be
prepared
for
and
looked
forward
to
whereas
if
you
mean
that
i
too
she
said
faltering
a
little
and
then
she
added
it
is
very
surprising
with
a
trouble
in
her
mind
which
yet
was
not
all
trouble
if
that
is
so
it
is
a
thing
well
over
and
it
is
very
wonderful
how
much
disturbance
people
give
themselves
about
it
if
this
is
all
this
is
not
all
however
her
friend
said
you
have
an
ordeal
before
you
which
you
will
not
find
pleasant
you
are
going
to
think
about
your
life
and
all
that
was
imperfect
in
it
and
which
might
have
been
done
better
we
are
none
of
us
perfect
said
lady
mary
with
a
little
of
that
natural
resentment
with
which
one
hears
one
self
accused
however
ready
one
may
be
to
accuse
one
self
permit
me
said
he
and
took
her
hand
and
led
her
away
without
further
explanation
the
people
about
were
so
busy
with
their
own
occupations
that
they
took
very
little
notice
neither
did
she
pay
much
attention
to
the
manner
in
which
they
were
engaged
their
looks
were
friendly
when
they
met
her
eye
and
she
too
felt
friendly
with
a
sense
of
brotherhood
but
she
had
always
been
a
kind
woman
she
wanted
to
step
aside
and
help
on
more
than
one
occasion
when
it
seemed
to
her
that
some
people
in
her
way
had
a
task
above
their
powers
but
this
her
conductor
would
not
permit
and
she
endeavored
to
put
some
questions
to
him
as
they
went
along
with
still
less
success
the
change
is
very
confusing
she
said
one
has
no
standard
to
judge
by
i
should
like
to
know
something
about
the
kind
of
people
and
the
manner
of
life
for
a
time
he
said
you
will
have
enough
to
do
without
troubling
yourself
about
that
this
naturally
produced
an
uneasy
sensation
in
her
mind
i
suppose
she
said
rather
timidly
that
we
are
not
in
what
we
have
been
accustomed
to
call
heaven
that
is
a
word
he
said
which
expresses
rather
a
condition
than
a
place
but
there
must
be
a
place
in
which
that
condition
can
exist
she
had
always
been
fond
of
discussions
of
this
kind
and
felt
encouraged
to
find
that
they
were
still
practicable
it
can
not
be
the
inferno
that
is
clear
at
least
she
added
with
the
sprightliness
which
was
one
of
her
characteristics
perhaps
purgatory
since
you
infer
i
have
something
to
endure
words
are
interchangeable
he
said
that
means
one
thing
to
one
of
us
which
to
another
has
a
totally
different
signification
there
was
something
so
like
his
old
self
in
this
that
she
laughed
with
an
irresistible
sense
of
amusement
you
were
always
fond
of
the
oracular
she
said
she
was
conscious
that
on
former
occasions
if
he
made
such
a
speech
to
her
though
she
would
have
felt
the
same
amusement
she
would
not
have
expressed
it
so
frankly
but
he
did
not
take
it
at
all
amiss
and
her
thoughts
went
on
in
other
directions
she
felt
herself
saying
over
to
herself
the
words
of
the
old
dirge
which
came
to
her
recollection
she
knew
not
how
if
hosen
and
shoon
thou
gavest
nane
the
whins
shall
prick
thee
intil
the
bane
when
she
saw
that
her
companion
heard
her
she
asked
is
that
true
he
shook
his
head
a
little
it
is
too
matter
of
fact
he
said
as
i
need
hardly
tell
you
hosen
and
shoon
are
good
but
they
do
not
always
sufficiently
indicate
the
state
of
the
heart
lady
mary
had
a
consciousness
which
was
pleasant
to
her
that
so
far
as
the
hosen
and
shoon
went
she
had
abundant
means
of
preparing
herself
for
the
pricks
of
any
road
however
rough
but
she
had
no
time
to
indulge
this
pleasing
reflection
for
she
was
shortly
introduced
into
a
great
building
full
of
innumerable
rooms
in
one
of
which
her
companion
left
her
iv
the
door
opened
and
she
felt
herself
free
to
come
out
how
long
she
had
been
there
or
what
passed
there
is
not
for
any
one
to
say
she
came
out
tingling
and
smarting
if
such
words
can
be
used
with
an
intolerable
recollection
of
the
last
act
of
her
life
so
intolerable
was
it
that
all
that
had
gone
before
and
all
the
risings
up
of
old
errors
and
visions
long
dead
were
forgotten
in
the
sharp
and
keen
prick
of
this
which
was
not
over
and
done
like
the
rest
no
one
had
accused
her
or
brought
before
her
judge
the
things
that
were
against
her
she
it
was
who
had
done
it
all
she
whose
memory
did
not
spare
her
one
fault
who
remembered
everything
but
when
she
came
to
that
last
frivolity
of
her
old
age
and
saw
for
the
first
time
how
she
had
played
with
the
future
of
the
child
whom
she
had
brought
up
and
abandoned
to
the
hardest
fate
for
nothing
for
folly
for
a
jest
the
horror
and
bitterness
of
the
thought
filled
her
mind
to
overflowing
in
the
first
anguish
of
that
recollection
she
had
to
go
forth
receiving
no
word
of
comfort
in
respect
to
it
meeting
only
with
a
look
of
sadness
and
compassion
which
went
to
her
very
heart
she
came
forth
as
if
she
had
been
driven
away
but
not
by
any
outward
influence
by
the
force
of
her
own
miserable
sensations
i
will
write
she
said
to
herself
and
tell
them
i
will
go
and
then
she
stopped
short
remembering
that
she
could
neither
go
nor
write
that
all
communication
with
the
world
she
had
left
was
closed
was
it
all
closed
was
there
no
way
in
which
a
message
could
reach
those
who
remained
behind
she
caught
the
first
whom
she
passed
and
addressed
him
piteously
oh
tell
me
you
have
been
longer
here
than
i
can
not
one
send
a
letter
a
message
if
it
were
only
a
single
word
where
he
said
stopping
and
listening
so
that
it
began
to
seem
possible
to
her
that
some
such
expedient
might
still
be
within
her
reach
it
is
to
england
she
said
thinking
he
meant
to
ask
as
to
which
quarter
of
the
world
ah
he
said
shaking
his
head
i
fear
that
it
is
impossible
but
it
is
to
set
something
right
which
out
of
mere
inadvertence
with
no
ill
meaning
no
no
she
repeated
to
herself
no
none
oh
sir
for
charity
tell
me
how
i
can
find
a
way
there
must
there
must
be
some
way
he
was
greatly
moved
by
the
sight
of
her
distress
i
am
but
a
stranger
here
he
said
i
may
be
wrong
there
are
others
who
can
tell
you
better
but
and
he
shook
his
head
sadly
most
of
us
would
be
so
thankful
if
we
could
to
send
a
word
if
it
were
only
a
single
word
to
those
we
have
left
behind
that
i
fear
i
fear
ah
cried
lady
mary
but
that
would
be
only
for
the
tenderness
whereas
this
is
for
justice
and
for
pity
and
to
do
away
with
a
great
wrong
which
i
did
before
i
came
here
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
he
said
but
shook
his
head
once
more
as
he
went
away
she
was
more
careful
next
time
and
chose
one
who
had
the
look
of
much
experience
and
knowledge
of
the
place
he
listened
to
her
very
gravely
and
answered
yes
that
he
was
one
of
the
officers
and
could
tell
her
whatever
she
wanted
to
know
but
when
she
told
him
what
she
wanted
he
too
shook
his
head
i
do
not
say
it
can
not
be
done
he
said
there
are
some
cases
in
which
it
has
been
successful
but
very
few
it
has
often
been
attempted
there
is
no
law
against
it
those
who
do
it
do
it
at
their
own
risk
they
suffer
much
and
almost
always
they
fail
no
oh
no
you
said
there
were
some
who
succeeded
no
one
can
be
more
anxious
than
i
will
give
anything
everything
i
have
in
the
world
he
gave
her
a
smile
which
was
very
grave
nevertheless
and
full
of
pity
you
forget
he
said
that
you
have
nothing
to
give
and
if
you
had
that
there
is
no
one
here
to
whom
it
would
be
of
any
value
though
she
was
no
longer
old
and
weak
yet
she
was
still
a
woman
and
she
began
to
weep
in
the
terrible
failure
and
contrariety
of
all
things
but
yet
she
would
not
yield
she
cried
there
must
be
some
one
here
who
would
do
it
for
love
i
have
had
people
who
loved
me
in
my
time
i
must
have
some
here
who
have
not
forgotten
me
ah
i
know
what
you
would
say
i
lived
so
long
i
forgot
them
all
and
why
should
they
remember
me
here
she
was
touched
on
the
arm
and
looking
round
saw
close
to
her
the
face
of
one
whom
it
was
very
true
she
had
forgotten
she
remembered
him
but
dimly
after
she
had
looked
long
at
him
a
little
group
had
gathered
about
her
with
grieved
looks
to
see
her
distress
he
who
had
touched
her
was
the
spokesman
of
them
all
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
he
said
for
you
and
for
love
and
then
they
all
sighed
surrounding
her
and
added
but
it
is
impossible
impossible
she
stood
and
gazed
at
them
recognizing
by
degrees
faces
that
she
knew
and
seeing
in
all
that
look
of
grief
and
sympathy
which
makes
all
human
souls
brothers
impossible
was
not
a
word
that
had
been
often
said
to
be
in
her
life
and
to
come
out
of
a
world
in
which
everything
could
be
changed
everything
communicated
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
find
a
dead
blank
before
her
and
around
her
through
which
not
a
word
could
go
was
more
terrible
than
can
be
said
in
words
she
looked
piteously
upon
them
with
that
anguish
of
helplessness
which
goes
to
every
heart
and
cried
what
is
impossible
to
send
a
word
only
a
word
to
set
right
what
is
wrong
oh
i
understand
she
said
lifting
up
her
hands
i
understand
that
to
send
messages
of
comfort
must
not
be
that
the
people
who
love
you
must
bear
it
as
we
all
have
done
in
our
time
and
trust
to
god
for
consolation
but
i
have
done
a
wrong
oh
listen
listen
to
me
my
friends
i
have
left
a
child
a
young
creature
unprovided
for
without
any
one
to
help
her
and
must
that
be
must
she
bear
it
and
i
bear
it
forever
and
no
means
no
way
of
setting
it
right
listen
to
me
i
was
there
last
night
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
was
still
there
and
here
this
morning
so
it
must
be
easy
to
come
only
a
short
way
and
two
words
would
be
enough
only
two
words
they
gathered
closer
and
closer
round
her
full
of
compassion
it
is
easy
to
come
they
said
but
not
to
go
and
one
added
it
will
not
be
forever
comfort
yourself
when
she
comes
here
or
to
a
better
place
that
will
seem
to
you
only
as
a
day
but
to
her
cried
lady
mary
to
her
it
will
be
long
years
it
will
be
trouble
and
sorrow
and
she
will
think
i
took
no
thought
for
her
and
she
will
be
right
the
penitent
said
with
a
great
and
bitter
cry
it
was
so
terrible
that
they
were
all
silent
and
said
not
a
word
except
the
man
who
had
loved
her
who
put
his
hand
upon
her
arm
and
said
we
are
here
for
that
this
is
the
fire
that
purges
us
to
see
at
last
what
we
have
done
and
the
true
aspect
of
it
and
to
know
the
cruel
wrong
yet
never
be
able
to
make
amends
she
remembered
then
that
this
was
a
man
who
had
neglected
all
lawful
affections
and
broken
the
hearts
of
those
who
trusted
him
for
her
sake
and
for
a
moment
she
forgot
her
own
burden
in
sorrow
for
his
it
was
now
that
he
who
had
called
himself
one
of
the
officers
came
forward
again
for
the
little
crowd
had
gathered
round
her
so
closely
that
he
had
been
shut
out
he
said
no
one
can
carry
your
message
for
you
that
is
not
permitted
but
there
is
still
a
possibility
you
may
have
permission
to
go
yourself
such
things
have
been
done
though
they
have
not
often
been
successful
but
if
you
will
she
shivered
when
she
heard
him
and
it
became
apparent
to
her
why
no
one
could
be
found
to
go
for
all
her
nature
revolted
from
that
step
which
it
was
evident
must
be
the
most
terrible
which
could
be
thought
of
she
looked
at
him
with
troubled
beseeching
eyes
and
the
rest
all
looked
at
her
pitying
and
trying
to
soothe
her
permission
will
not
be
refused
he
said
for
a
worthy
cause
upon
which
the
others
all
spoke
together
entreating
her
already
they
cried
they
have
forgotten
you
living
you
are
to
them
one
who
is
dead
they
will
be
afraid
of
you
if
they
can
see
you
oh
go
not
back
be
content
to
wait
to
wait
it
is
only
a
little
while
the
life
of
man
is
nothing
it
appears
for
a
little
time
and
then
it
vanishes
away
and
when
she
comes
here
she
will
know
or
in
a
better
place
they
sighed
as
they
named
the
better
place
though
some
smiled
too
feeling
perhaps
more
near
to
it
lady
mary
listened
to
them
all
but
she
kept
her
eyes
upon
the
face
of
him
who
offered
her
this
possibility
there
passed
through
her
mind
a
hundred
stories
she
had
heard
of
those
who
had
but
not
one
that
spoke
of
them
as
welcome
as
received
with
joy
as
comforting
those
they
loved
ah
no
was
it
not
rather
a
curse
upon
the
house
to
which
they
came
the
rooms
were
shut
up
the
houses
abandoned
where
they
were
supposed
to
appear
those
whom
they
had
loved
best
feared
and
fled
them
they
were
a
vulgar
wonder
a
thing
that
the
poorest
laughed
at
yet
feared
poor
banished
souls
it
was
because
no
one
would
listen
to
them
that
they
had
to
linger
and
wait
and
come
and
go
she
shivered
and
in
spite
of
her
longing
and
her
repentance
a
cold
dread
and
horror
took
possession
of
her
she
looked
round
upon
her
companions
for
comfort
and
found
none
do
not
go
they
said
do
not
go
we
have
endured
like
you
we
wait
till
all
things
are
made
clear
and
another
said
all
will
be
made
clear
it
is
but
for
a
time
she
turned
from
one
to
another
and
back
again
to
the
first
speaker
he
who
had
authority
he
said
it
is
very
rarely
successful
it
retards
the
course
of
your
penitence
it
is
an
indulgence
and
it
may
bring
harm
and
not
good
but
if
the
meaning
is
generous
and
just
permission
will
be
given
and
you
may
go
then
all
the
strength
of
her
nature
rose
in
her
she
thought
of
the
child
forsaken
and
of
the
dark
world
round
her
where
she
would
find
so
few
friends
and
of
the
home
shut
up
in
which
she
had
lived
her
young
and
pleasant
life
and
of
the
thoughts
that
must
rise
in
her
heart
as
though
she
were
forsaken
and
abandoned
of
god
and
man
then
lady
mary
turned
to
the
man
who
had
authority
she
said
if
he
whom
i
saw
will
give
me
his
blessing
i
will
go
and
they
all
pressed
round
her
weeping
and
kissing
her
hands
he
will
not
refuse
his
blessing
they
said
but
the
way
is
terrible
and
you
are
still
weak
how
can
you
encounter
all
the
misery
of
it
he
commands
no
one
to
try
that
dark
and
dreadful
way
i
will
try
lady
mary
said
the
night
which
lady
mary
had
been
conscious
of
in
a
momentary
glimpse
full
of
the
exaggeration
of
fever
had
not
indeed
been
so
expeditious
as
she
believed
the
doctor
it
is
true
had
been
pronouncing
her
when
she
saw
him
holding
her
wrist
and
wondered
what
he
did
there
in
the
middle
of
the
night
but
she
had
been
very
ill
before
this
and
the
conclusion
of
her
life
had
been
watched
with
many
tears
then
there
had
risen
up
a
wonderful
commotion
in
the
house
of
which
little
mary
her
godchild
was
very
little
sensible
had
she
left
any
will
any
instructions
the
slightest
indication
of
what
she
wished
to
be
done
after
her
death
furnival
who
had
been
very
anxious
to
be
allowed
to
see
her
even
in
the
last
days
of
her
illness
said
emphatically
no
she
had
never
executed
any
will
never
made
any
disposition
of
her
affairs
he
said
almost
with
bitterness
in
the
tone
of
one
who
is
ready
to
weep
with
vexation
and
distress
the
vicar
took
a
more
hopeful
view
he
said
it
was
impossible
that
so
considerate
a
person
could
have
done
this
and
that
there
must
he
was
sure
be
found
somewhere
if
close
examination
was
made
a
memorandum
a
letter
something
which
should
show
what
she
wished
for
she
must
have
known
very
well
notwithstanding
all
flatteries
and
compliments
upon
her
good
looks
that
from
day
to
day
her
existence
was
never
to
be
calculated
upon
the
doctor
did
not
share
this
last
opinion
he
said
that
there
was
no
fathoming
the
extraordinary
views
that
people
took
of
their
own
case
and
that
it
was
quite
possible
though
it
seemed
incredible
that
lady
mary
might
really
be
as
little
expectant
of
death
on
the
way
to
ninety
as
a
girl
of
seventeen
but
still
he
was
of
opinion
that
she
might
have
left
a
memorandum
somewhere
these
three
gentlemen
were
in
the
foreground
of
affairs
because
she
had
no
relations
to
step
in
and
take
the
management
the
earl
her
grandson
was
abroad
and
there
were
only
his
solicitors
to
interfere
on
his
behalf
men
to
whom
lady
mary
fortune
was
quite
unimportant
although
it
was
against
their
principles
to
let
anything
slip
out
of
their
hands
that
could
aggrandize
their
client
but
who
knew
nothing
about
the
circumstances
about
little
mary
about
the
old
lady
peculiarities
in
any
way
therefore
the
persons
who
had
surrounded
her
in
her
life
and
furnival
her
man
of
business
were
the
persons
who
really
had
the
management
of
everything
their
wives
interfered
a
little
too
or
rather
the
one
wife
who
only
could
do
so
the
wife
of
the
vicar
who
came
in
beneficently
at
once
and
took
poor
little
mary
in
her
first
desolation
out
of
the
melancholy
house
vicar
did
this
without
any
hesitation
knowing
very
well
that
in
all
probability
lady
mary
had
made
no
will
and
consequently
that
the
poor
girl
was
destitute
a
great
deal
is
said
about
the
hardness
of
the
world
and
the
small
consideration
that
is
shown
for
a
destitute
dependent
in
such
circumstances
but
this
is
not
true
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
never
or
very
rarely
such
profound
need
in
the
world
without
a
great
deal
of
kindness
and
much
pity
the
three
gentlemen
all
along
had
been
entirely
in
mary
interest
they
had
not
expected
legacies
from
the
old
lady
or
any
advantage
to
themselves
it
was
of
the
girl
that
they
had
thought
and
when
now
they
examined
everything
and
inquired
into
all
her
ways
and
what
she
had
done
it
was
of
mary
they
were
thinking
but
furnival
was
very
certain
of
his
point
he
knew
that
lady
mary
had
made
no
will
time
after
time
he
had
pressed
it
upon
her
he
was
very
sure
even
while
he
examined
her
and
turned
out
all
the
drawers
that
nothing
would
be
found
the
little
italian
cabinet
had
in
its
drawers
fragments
of
old
lace
pieces
of
ribbon
little
nothings
of
all
sorts
nobody
thought
of
the
secret
drawer
and
if
they
had
thought
of
it
where
could
a
place
have
been
found
less
likely
if
she
had
ever
made
a
will
she
could
have
had
no
reason
for
concealing
it
to
be
sure
they
did
not
reason
in
this
way
being
simply
unaware
of
any
place
of
concealment
at
all
and
mary
knew
nothing
about
this
search
they
were
making
she
did
not
know
how
she
was
herself
left
when
the
first
misery
of
grief
was
exhausted
she
began
indeed
to
have
troubled
thoughts
in
her
own
mind
to
expect
that
the
vicar
would
speak
to
her
or
furnival
send
for
her
and
tell
her
what
she
was
to
do
but
nothing
was
said
to
her
the
vicar
wife
had
asked
her
to
come
for
a
long
visit
and
the
anxious
people
who
were
forever
talking
over
this
subject
and
consulting
what
was
best
for
her
had
come
to
no
decision
as
yet
as
to
what
must
be
said
to
the
person
chiefly
concerned
it
was
too
to
have
to
put
the
real
state
of
affairs
before
her
the
doctor
had
no
wife
but
he
had
an
anxious
mother
who
though
she
would
not
for
the
world
have
been
unkind
to
the
poor
girl
yet
was
very
anxious
that
she
should
be
disposed
of
and
out
of
her
son
way
it
is
true
that
the
doctor
was
forty
and
mary
only
eighteen
but
what
then
matches
of
that
kind
were
seen
every
day
and
his
heart
was
so
soft
to
the
child
that
his
mother
never
knew
from
one
day
to
another
what
might
happen
she
had
naturally
no
doubt
at
all
that
mary
would
seize
the
first
hand
held
out
to
her
and
as
time
went
on
held
many
an
anxious
consultation
with
the
vicar
wife
on
the
subject
you
can
not
have
her
with
you
forever
she
said
she
must
know
one
time
or
another
how
she
is
left
and
that
she
must
learn
to
do
something
for
herself
oh
said
the
vicar
wife
how
is
she
to
be
told
it
is
to
look
at
her
and
to
think
nothing
but
luxury
all
her
life
and
now
in
a
moment
destitution
i
am
very
glad
to
have
her
with
me
she
is
a
dear
little
thing
and
so
nice
with
the
children
and
if
some
good
man
would
only
step
in
the
doctor
mother
trembled
for
that
a
good
man
should
step
in
was
exactly
what
she
feared
that
is
a
thing
that
can
never
be
depended
upon
she
said
and
marriages
made
out
of
compassion
are
just
as
bad
as
mercenary
marriages
oh
no
my
dear
bowyer
mary
has
a
great
deal
of
character
you
should
put
more
confidence
in
her
than
that
no
doubt
she
will
be
much
cast
down
at
first
but
when
she
knows
she
will
rise
to
the
occasion
and
show
what
is
in
her
poor
little
thing
what
is
in
a
girl
of
eighteen
and
one
that
has
lain
on
the
roses
and
fed
on
the
lilies
all
her
life
oh
i
could
find
it
in
my
heart
to
say
a
great
deal
about
old
lady
mary
that
would
not
be
pleasant
why
did
she
bring
her
up
so
if
she
did
not
mean
to
provide
for
her
i
think
she
must
have
been
at
heart
a
wicked
old
woman
oh
no
we
must
not
say
that
i
dare
say
as
my
son
says
she
always
meant
to
do
it
sometime
how
long
did
she
expect
to
live
i
wonder
well
said
the
doctor
mother
it
is
wonderful
how
little
old
one
feels
sometimes
within
one
self
even
when
one
is
well
up
in
years
she
was
of
the
faction
of
the
old
instead
of
being
like
bowyer
who
was
not
much
over
thirty
of
the
faction
of
the
young
she
could
make
excuses
for
lady
mary
but
she
thought
that
it
was
unkind
to
bring
the
poor
little
girl
here
in
ignorance
of
her
real
position
and
in
the
way
of
men
who
though
old
enough
to
know
better
were
still
capable
of
folly
as
what
man
is
not
when
a
girl
of
eighteen
is
concerned
i
hope
she
added
that
the
earl
will
do
something
for
her
certainly
he
ought
to
when
he
knows
all
that
his
grandmother
did
and
what
her
intentions
must
have
been
he
ought
to
make
her
a
little
allowance
that
is
the
least
he
can
do
not
to
be
sure
such
a
provision
as
we
all
hoped
lady
mary
was
going
to
make
for
her
but
enough
to
live
upon
furnival
i
believe
has
written
to
him
to
that
effect
hush
cried
the
vicar
wife
indeed
she
had
been
making
signs
to
the
other
lady
who
stood
with
her
back
to
the
door
for
some
moments
mary
had
come
in
while
this
conversation
was
going
on
she
had
not
paid
any
attention
to
it
and
yet
her
ear
had
been
caught
by
the
names
of
lady
mary
and
the
earl
and
furnival
for
whom
was
it
that
the
earl
should
make
an
allowance
enough
to
live
upon
whom
lady
mary
had
not
provided
for
and
whom
furnival
had
written
about
when
she
sat
down
to
the
in
which
she
was
helping
vicar
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
she
should
not
ponder
these
words
for
some
time
very
vaguely
not
perceiving
the
meaning
of
them
and
then
with
a
start
she
woke
up
to
perceive
that
there
must
be
something
meant
some
one
even
some
one
she
knew
and
then
the
needle
dropped
out
of
the
girl
hand
and
the
pinafore
she
was
making
fell
on
the
floor
some
one
it
must
be
herself
they
meant
who
but
she
could
be
the
subject
of
that
earnest
conversation
she
began
to
remember
a
great
many
conversations
as
earnest
which
had
been
stopped
when
she
came
into
the
room
and
the
looks
of
pity
which
had
been
bent
upon
her
she
had
thought
in
her
innocence
that
this
was
because
she
had
lost
her
godmother
her
protectress
and
had
been
very
grateful
for
the
kindness
of
her
friends
but
now
another
meaning
came
into
everything
bowyer
had
accompanied
her
visitor
to
the
door
still
talking
and
when
she
returned
her
face
was
very
grave
but
she
smiled
when
she
met
mary
look
and
said
cheerfully
how
kind
of
you
my
dear
to
make
all
those
pinafores
for
me
the
little
ones
will
not
know
themselves
they
never
were
so
fine
before
oh
bowyer
cried
the
girl
i
have
guessed
something
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me
are
you
keeping
me
for
charity
and
is
it
i
that
am
left
without
any
provision
and
that
furnival
has
written
she
could
not
finish
her
sentence
for
it
was
very
bitter
to
her
as
may
be
supposed
i
do
know
what
you
mean
my
dear
cried
the
vicar
wife
charity
well
i
suppose
that
is
the
same
as
love
at
least
it
is
so
in
the
chapter
of
corinthians
you
are
staying
with
us
i
hope
for
love
if
that
is
what
you
mean
upon
which
she
took
the
girl
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
and
cried
as
women
must
my
dearest
she
said
as
you
have
guessed
the
worst
it
is
better
to
tell
you
lady
mary
i
do
know
why
oh
i
do
wish
to
blame
her
has
left
no
will
and
my
dear
my
dear
you
who
have
been
brought
up
in
luxury
you
have
not
a
penny
here
the
vicar
wife
gave
mary
a
closer
hug
and
kissed
her
once
more
we
love
you
all
the
better
if
that
was
possible
she
said
how
many
thoughts
will
fly
through
a
girl
mind
while
her
head
rests
on
some
kind
shoulder
and
she
is
being
consoled
for
the
first
calamity
that
has
touched
her
life
she
was
neither
ungrateful
nor
unresponsive
but
as
bowyer
pressed
her
close
to
her
kind
breast
and
cried
over
her
mary
did
not
cry
but
thought
seeing
in
a
moment
a
succession
of
scenes
and
realizing
in
a
moment
so
complete
a
new
world
that
all
her
pain
was
quelled
by
the
hurry
and
rush
in
her
brain
as
her
forces
rallied
to
sustain
her
she
withdrew
from
her
kind
support
after
a
moment
with
eyes
tearless
and
shining
the
color
mounting
to
her
face
and
not
a
sign
of
discouragement
in
her
nor
yet
of
sentiment
though
she
grasped
her
kind
friend
hands
with
a
pressure
which
her
innocent
small
fingers
seemed
incapable
of
giving
one
has
read
of
such
things
in
books
she
said
with
a
faint
courageous
smile
and
i
suppose
they
happen
in
life
oh
my
dear
too
often
in
life
though
how
people
can
be
so
cruel
so
indifferent
so
careless
of
the
happiness
of
those
they
love
here
mary
pressed
her
friend
hands
till
they
hurt
and
cried
not
cruel
not
indifferent
i
can
not
hear
a
word
well
dear
it
is
like
you
to
feel
so
i
knew
you
would
and
i
will
not
say
a
word
oh
mary
if
she
ever
thinks
of
such
things
now
i
hope
she
will
not
i
hope
she
can
not
cried
the
girl
with
once
more
a
vehement
pressure
of
her
friend
hands
what
is
that
bowyer
said
looking
round
it
is
somebody
in
the
next
room
i
suppose
no
dear
i
hope
so
too
for
she
would
not
be
happy
if
she
remembered
mary
dry
your
eyes
my
dear
try
not
to
think
of
this
i
am
sure
there
is
some
one
in
the
next
room
and
you
must
try
not
to
look
wretched
for
all
our
sakes
wretched
cried
mary
springing
up
i
am
not
wretched
and
she
turned
with
a
countenance
glowing
and
full
of
courage
to
the
door
but
there
was
no
one
there
no
visitor
lingering
in
the
smaller
room
as
sometimes
happened
i
thought
i
heard
some
one
come
in
said
the
vicar
wife
did
you
hear
something
mary
i
suppose
it
is
because
i
am
so
agitated
with
all
this
but
i
could
have
sworn
i
heard
some
one
come
in
there
is
nobody
said
mary
who
in
the
shock
of
the
calamity
which
had
so
suddenly
changed
the
world
to
her
was
perfectly
calm
she
did
not
feel
at
all
disposed
to
cry
or
give
way
it
went
to
her
head
with
a
thrill
of
pain
which
was
excitement
as
well
like
a
strong
stimulant
suddenly
applied
and
she
added
i
should
like
to
go
out
a
little
if
you
do
mind
just
to
get
used
to
the
idea
my
dear
i
will
get
my
hat
in
a
moment
no
please
it
is
not
unkindness
but
i
must
think
it
over
by
myself
by
myself
mary
cried
she
hurried
away
while
bowyer
took
another
survey
of
the
outer
room
and
called
the
servant
to
know
who
had
been
calling
nobody
had
been
calling
the
maid
said
but
her
mistress
still
shook
her
head
it
must
have
been
some
one
who
does
not
ring
who
just
opens
the
door
she
said
to
herself
that
is
the
worst
of
the
country
it
might
be
blunt
or
sophia
blackburn
or
the
curate
or
people
and
they
have
just
gone
away
when
they
heard
me
crying
how
could
i
help
crying
but
i
wonder
how
much
they
heard
whoever
it
was
vi
it
was
winter
and
snow
was
on
the
ground
lady
mary
found
herself
on
the
road
that
led
through
her
own
village
going
home
it
was
like
a
picture
of
a
wintry
night
like
one
of
those
pictures
that
please
the
children
at
christmas
a
little
snow
sprinkled
on
the
roofs
just
enough
to
define
them
and
on
the
edges
of
the
roads
every
cottage
window
showing
a
ruddy
glimmer
in
the
twilight
the
men
coming
home
from
their
work
the
children
tied
up
in
comforters
and
caps
stealing
in
from
the
slides
and
from
the
pond
where
they
were
forbidden
to
go
and
in
the
distance
the
trees
of
the
great
house
standing
up
dark
turning
the
twilight
into
night
she
had
a
curious
enjoyment
in
it
simple
like
that
of
a
child
and
a
wish
to
talk
to
some
one
out
of
the
fullness
of
her
heart
she
overtook
her
step
being
far
lighter
than
his
one
of
the
men
going
home
from
his
work
and
spoke
to
him
telling
him
with
a
smile
not
to
be
afraid
but
he
never
so
much
as
raised
his
head
and
went
plodding
on
with
his
heavy
step
not
knowing
that
she
had
spoken
to
him
she
was
startled
by
this
but
said
to
herself
that
the
men
were
dull
that
their
perceptions
were
confused
and
that
it
was
getting
dark
and
went
on
passing
him
quickly
his
breath
made
a
cloud
in
the
air
as
he
walked
and
his
heavy
plodding
steps
sounded
into
the
frosty
night
she
perceived
that
her
own
were
invisible
and
inaudible
with
a
curious
momentary
sensation
half
of
pleasure
half
of
pain
she
felt
no
cold
and
she
saw
through
the
twilight
as
clearly
as
if
it
had
been
day
there
was
no
fatigue
or
sense
of
weakness
in
her
but
she
had
the
strange
wistful
feeling
of
an
exile
returning
after
long
years
not
knowing
how
he
may
find
those
he
had
left
at
one
of
the
first
houses
in
the
village
there
was
a
woman
standing
at
her
door
looking
out
for
her
children
one
who
knew
lady
mary
well
she
stopped
quite
cheerfully
to
bid
her
good
evening
as
she
had
done
in
her
vigorous
days
before
she
grew
old
it
was
a
little
experiment
too
she
thought
it
possible
that
catherine
would
scream
out
and
perhaps
fly
from
her
but
surely
would
be
easily
reassured
when
she
heard
the
voice
she
knew
and
saw
by
her
one
who
was
no
ghost
but
her
own
kind
mistress
but
catherine
took
no
notice
when
she
spoke
she
did
not
so
much
as
turn
her
head
lady
mary
stood
by
her
patiently
with
more
and
more
of
that
wistful
desire
to
be
recognized
she
put
her
hand
timidly
upon
the
woman
arm
who
was
thinking
of
nothing
but
her
boys
and
calling
to
them
straining
her
eyes
in
the
fading
light
do
be
afraid
they
are
coming
they
are
safe
she
said
pressing
catherine
arm
but
the
woman
never
moved
she
took
no
notice
she
called
to
a
neighbor
who
was
passing
to
ask
if
she
had
seen
the
children
and
the
two
stood
and
talked
in
the
dim
air
not
conscious
of
the
third
who
stood
between
them
looking
from
one
to
another
astonished
paralyzed
lady
mary
had
not
been
prepared
for
this
she
could
not
believe
it
even
now
she
repeated
their
names
more
and
more
anxiously
and
even
plucked
at
their
sleeves
to
call
their
attention
she
stood
as
a
poor
dependent
sometimes
stands
wistful
civil
trying
to
say
something
that
will
please
while
they
talked
and
took
no
notice
and
then
the
neighbor
passed
on
and
catherine
went
into
her
house
it
is
hard
to
be
left
out
in
the
cold
when
others
go
into
their
cheerful
houses
but
to
be
thus
left
outside
of
life
to
speak
and
not
be
heard
to
stand
unseen
astounded
unable
to
secure
any
attention
she
had
thought
they
would
be
frightened
but
it
was
not
they
who
were
frightened
a
great
panic
seized
the
woman
who
was
no
more
of
this
world
she
had
almost
rejoiced
to
find
herself
back
walking
so
lightly
so
strongly
finding
everything
easy
that
had
been
so
hard
and
yet
but
a
few
minutes
had
passed
and
she
knew
never
more
to
be
deceived
that
she
was
no
longer
of
this
world
what
if
she
should
be
condemned
to
wander
forever
among
familiar
places
that
knew
her
no
more
appealing
for
a
look
a
word
to
those
who
could
no
longer
see
her
or
hear
her
cry
or
know
of
her
presence
terror
seized
upon
her
a
chill
and
pang
of
fear
beyond
description
she
felt
an
impulse
to
fly
wildly
into
the
dark
into
the
night
like
a
lost
creature
to
find
again
somehow
she
could
not
tell
how
the
door
out
of
which
she
had
come
and
beat
upon
it
wildly
with
her
hands
and
implore
to
be
taken
home
for
a
moment
she
stood
looking
round
her
lost
and
alone
in
the
wide
universe
no
one
to
speak
to
her
no
one
to
comfort
her
outside
of
life
altogether
other
rustic
figures
leisurely
at
their
ease
went
and
came
one
at
a
time
but
in
this
place
where
every
stranger
was
an
object
of
curiosity
no
one
cast
a
glance
at
her
she
was
as
if
she
had
never
been
presently
she
found
herself
entering
her
own
house
it
was
all
shut
and
silent
not
a
window
lighted
along
the
whole
front
of
the
house
which
used
to
twinkle
and
glitter
with
lights
it
soothed
her
somewhat
to
see
this
as
if
in
evidence
that
the
place
had
changed
with
her
she
went
in
silently
and
the
darkness
was
as
day
to
her
her
own
rooms
were
all
shut
up
yet
were
open
to
her
steps
which
no
external
obstacle
could
limit
there
was
still
the
sound
of
life
below
stairs
and
in
the
room
a
cheerful
party
gathered
round
the
fire
it
was
then
that
she
turned
first
with
some
wistful
human
attraction
towards
the
warmth
and
light
rather
than
to
the
still
places
in
which
her
own
life
had
been
passed
prentiss
the
housekeeper
had
her
daughter
with
her
on
a
visit
and
the
daughter
baby
lay
asleep
in
a
cradle
placed
upon
two
chairs
outside
the
little
circle
of
women
round
the
table
one
of
whom
was
jervis
lady
mary
maid
jervis
sat
and
worked
and
cried
and
mixed
her
words
with
little
sobs
i
never
thought
as
i
should
have
had
to
take
another
place
she
said
brown
and
me
we
made
sure
of
a
little
something
to
start
upon
he
been
here
for
twenty
years
and
so
have
you
prentiss
and
me
as
nobody
can
say
i
was
faithful
night
and
day
i
never
had
that
confidence
in
my
lady
to
expect
anything
prentiss
said
oh
mother
do
say
that
many
and
many
a
day
you
said
my
lady
dies
and
we
all
said
it
said
jervis
i
ca
think
how
she
did
it
nor
why
she
did
it
for
she
was
a
kind
lady
though
appearances
is
against
her
she
was
one
of
them
and
i
known
a
many
as
could
not
abide
to
see
a
gloomy
face
said
the
housekeeper
she
kept
us
all
comfortable
for
the
sake
of
being
comfortable
herself
but
no
more
oh
you
are
hard
upon
my
lady
cried
jervis
and
i
ca
bear
to
hear
a
word
against
her
though
it
been
an
awful
disappointment
to
me
what
you
or
me
or
any
one
cried
prentiss
in
comparison
of
that
poor
little
thing
that
ca
work
for
her
living
like
we
can
that
is
left
on
the
charity
of
folks
she
do
belong
to
i
have
forgiven
my
lady
anything
if
she
done
what
was
right
by
miss
mary
you
get
a
place
and
a
good
place
and
me
they
leave
me
here
when
the
new
folks
come
as
have
taken
the
house
but
what
will
become
of
her
the
darling
and
not
a
penny
nor
a
friend
nor
one
to
look
to
her
oh
you
selfish
old
woman
oh
you
heart
of
stone
i
just
hope
you
are
feeling
it
where
you
gone
the
housekeeper
cried
but
as
she
said
this
the
woman
did
not
know
who
was
looking
at
her
with
wide
wistful
eyes
holding
out
her
hands
in
appeal
receiving
every
word
as
if
it
had
been
a
blow
though
she
knew
it
was
useless
lady
mary
could
not
help
it
she
cried
out
to
them
have
pity
upon
me
have
pity
upon
me
i
am
not
cruel
as
you
think
with
a
keen
anguish
in
her
voice
which
seemed
to
be
sharp
enough
to
pierce
the
very
air
and
go
up
to
the
skies
and
so
perhaps
it
did
but
never
touched
the
human
atmosphere
in
which
she
stood
a
stranger
jervis
was
threading
her
needle
when
her
mistress
uttered
that
cry
but
her
hand
did
not
tremble
nor
did
the
thread
deflect
a
from
the
straight
line
the
young
mother
alone
seemed
to
be
moved
by
some
faint
disturbance
hush
she
said
is
he
waking
looking
towards
the
cradle
but
as
the
baby
made
no
further
sound
she
too
returned
to
her
sewing
and
they
sat
bending
their
heads
over
their
work
round
the
table
and
continued
their
talk
the
room
was
very
comfortable
bright
and
warm
as
lady
mary
had
liked
all
her
rooms
to
be
the
warm
firelight
danced
upon
the
walls
the
women
talked
in
cheerful
tones
she
stood
outside
their
circle
and
looked
at
them
with
a
wistful
face
their
notice
would
have
been
more
sweet
to
her
as
she
stood
in
that
great
humiliation
than
in
other
times
the
look
of
a
queen
but
what
is
the
matter
with
baby
the
mother
said
rising
hastily
it
was
with
no
servile
intention
of
securing
a
look
from
that
little
prince
of
life
that
she
who
was
not
of
this
world
had
stepped
aside
forlorn
and
looked
at
him
in
his
cradle
though
she
was
not
of
this
world
she
was
still
a
woman
and
had
nursed
her
children
in
her
arms
she
bent
over
the
infant
by
the
soft
impulse
of
nature
tenderly
with
no
interested
thought
but
the
child
saw
her
was
it
possible
he
turned
his
head
towards
her
and
flickered
his
baby
hands
and
cooed
with
that
indescribable
voice
that
goes
to
every
woman
heart
lady
mary
felt
such
a
thrill
of
pleasure
go
through
her
as
no
incident
had
given
her
for
long
years
she
put
out
her
arms
to
him
as
his
mother
snatched
him
from
his
little
bed
and
he
which
was
more
wonderful
stretched
towards
her
in
his
innocence
turning
away
from
them
all
he
wants
to
go
to
some
one
cried
the
mother
oh
look
look
for
sake
who
is
there
that
the
child
sees
there
no
one
there
not
a
soul
now
dearie
dearie
be
reasonable
you
can
see
for
yourself
there
not
a
creature
said
the
grandmother
oh
my
baby
my
baby
he
sees
something
we
ca
see
the
young
woman
cried
something
has
happened
to
his
father
or
he
going
to
be
taken
from
me
she
said
holding
the
child
to
her
in
a
sudden
passion
the
other
women
rushed
to
her
to
console
her
the
mother
with
reason
and
jervis
with
poetry
it
the
angels
whispering
like
the
song
says
oh
the
pang
that
was
in
the
heart
of
the
other
whom
they
could
not
hear
she
stood
wondering
how
it
could
be
wondering
with
an
amazement
beyond
words
how
all
that
was
in
her
heart
the
love
and
the
pain
and
the
sweetness
and
bitterness
could
all
be
hidden
all
hidden
by
that
air
in
which
the
women
stood
so
clear
she
held
out
her
hands
she
spoke
to
them
telling
who
she
was
but
no
one
paid
any
attention
only
the
little
dog
fido
who
had
been
basking
by
the
fire
sprang
up
looked
at
her
and
retreating
slowly
backwards
till
he
reached
the
wall
sat
down
there
and
looked
at
her
again
with
now
and
then
a
little
bark
of
inquiry
the
dog
saw
her
this
gave
her
a
curious
pang
of
humiliation
yet
pleasure
she
went
away
out
of
that
little
centre
of
human
life
in
a
great
excitement
and
thrill
of
her
whole
being
the
child
had
seen
her
and
the
dog
but
oh
heavens
how
was
she
to
work
out
her
purpose
by
such
auxiliaries
as
these
she
went
up
to
her
old
bedchamber
with
unshed
tears
heavy
about
her
eyes
and
a
pathetic
smile
quivering
on
her
mouth
it
touched
her
beyond
measure
that
the
child
should
have
that
confidence
in
her
then
god
is
still
with
me
she
said
to
herself
her
room
which
had
been
so
warm
and
bright
lay
desolate
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
but
she
wanted
no
light
for
the
darkness
was
no
darkness
to
her
she
looked
round
her
for
a
little
wondering
to
think
how
far
away
from
her
now
was
this
scene
of
her
old
life
but
feeling
no
pain
in
the
sight
of
it
only
a
kind
indulgence
for
the
foolish
simplicity
which
had
taken
so
much
pride
in
all
these
infantile
elements
of
living
she
went
to
the
little
italian
cabinet
which
stood
against
the
wall
feeling
now
at
least
that
she
could
do
as
she
would
that
here
there
was
no
blank
of
human
unconsciousness
to
stand
in
her
way
but
she
was
met
by
something
that
baffled
and
vexed
her
once
more
she
felt
the
polished
surface
of
the
wood
under
her
hand
and
saw
all
the
pretty
ornamentation
the
the
delicate
carvings
which
she
knew
so
well
they
swam
in
her
eyes
a
little
as
if
they
were
part
of
some
phantasmagoria
about
her
existing
only
in
her
vision
yet
the
smooth
surface
resisted
her
touch
and
when
she
withdrew
a
step
from
it
it
stood
before
her
solidly
and
square
as
it
had
stood
always
a
glory
to
the
place
she
put
forth
her
hands
upon
it
and
could
have
traced
the
waving
lines
of
the
exquisite
work
in
which
some
artist
soul
had
worked
itself
out
in
the
old
times
but
though
she
thus
saw
it
and
felt
she
could
not
with
all
her
endeavors
find
the
handle
of
the
drawer
the
knob
of
ivory
the
little
door
that
opened
into
the
secret
place
how
long
she
stood
by
it
attempting
again
and
again
to
find
what
was
as
familiar
to
her
as
her
own
hand
what
was
before
her
visible
in
every
line
what
she
felt
with
fingers
which
began
to
tremble
she
could
not
tell
time
did
not
count
with
her
as
with
common
men
she
did
not
grow
weary
or
require
refreshment
or
rest
like
those
who
were
still
of
this
world
put
at
length
her
head
grew
giddy
and
her
heart
failed
a
cold
despair
took
possession
of
her
soul
she
could
do
nothing
then
nothing
neither
by
help
of
man
neither
by
use
of
her
own
faculties
which
were
greater
and
clearer
than
ever
before
she
sank
down
upon
the
floor
at
the
foot
of
that
old
toy
which
had
pleased
her
in
the
softness
of
her
old
age
to
which
she
had
trusted
the
fortunes
of
another
by
which
in
wantonness
and
folly
she
had
sinned
she
had
sinned
and
she
thought
she
saw
standing
round
her
companions
in
the
land
she
had
left
saying
it
is
impossible
impossible
with
infinite
pity
in
their
eyes
and
the
face
of
him
who
had
given
her
permission
to
come
yet
who
had
said
no
word
to
her
to
encourage
her
in
what
was
against
nature
and
there
came
into
her
heart
a
longing
to
fly
to
get
home
to
be
back
in
the
land
where
her
fellows
were
and
her
appointed
place
a
child
lost
how
pitiful
that
is
without
power
to
reason
and
divine
how
help
will
come
but
a
soul
lost
outside
of
one
method
of
existence
withdrawn
from
the
other
knowing
no
way
to
retrace
its
steps
nor
how
help
can
come
there
had
been
no
bitterness
in
passing
from
earth
to
the
land
where
she
had
gone
but
now
there
came
upon
her
soul
in
all
the
power
of
her
new
faculties
the
bitterness
of
death
the
place
which
was
hers
she
had
forsaken
and
left
and
the
place
that
had
been
hers
knew
her
no
more
vii
mary
when
she
left
her
kind
friend
in
the
vicarage
went
out
and
took
a
long
walk
she
had
received
a
shock
so
great
that
it
took
all
sensation
from
her
and
threw
her
into
the
seething
and
surging
of
an
excitement
altogether
beyond
her
control
she
could
not
think
until
she
had
got
familiar
with
the
idea
which
indeed
had
been
vaguely
shaping
itself
in
her
mind
ever
since
she
had
emerged
from
the
first
profound
gloom
and
prostration
of
the
shadow
of
death
she
had
never
definitely
thought
of
her
position
before
never
even
asked
herself
what
was
to
become
of
her
when
lady
mary
died
she
did
not
see
any
more
than
lady
mary
did
why
she
should
ever
die
and
girls
who
have
never
wanted
anything
in
their
lives
who
have
had
no
sharp
experience
to
enlighten
them
are
slow
to
think
upon
such
subjects
she
had
not
expected
anything
her
mind
had
not
formed
any
idea
of
inheritance
and
it
had
not
surprised
her
to
hear
of
the
earl
who
was
lady
mary
natural
heir
nor
to
feel
herself
separated
from
the
house
in
which
all
her
previous
life
had
been
passed
but
there
had
been
gradually
dawning
upon
her
a
sense
that
she
had
come
to
a
crisis
in
her
life
and
that
she
must
soon
be
told
what
was
to
become
of
her
it
was
not
so
urgent
as
that
she
should
ask
any
questions
but
it
began
to
appear
very
clearly
in
her
mind
that
things
were
not
to
be
with
her
as
they
had
been
she
had
heard
the
complaints
and
astonishment
of
the
servants
to
whom
lady
mary
had
left
nothing
with
resentment
jervis
who
could
not
marry
and
take
her
but
must
wait
until
she
had
saved
more
money
and
wept
to
think
after
all
her
devotion
of
having
to
take
another
place
and
prentiss
the
housekeeper
who
was
cynical
and
expounded
lady
mary
kindness
to
her
servants
to
be
the
issue
of
a
refined
selfishness
and
brown
who
had
sworn
subdued
oaths
and
had
taken
the
liberty
of
representing
himself
to
mary
as
in
the
same
box
with
herself
mary
had
been
angry
very
angry
at
all
this
and
she
had
not
by
word
or
look
given
any
one
to
understand
that
she
felt
herself
in
the
same
box
but
yet
she
had
been
vaguely
anxious
curious
desiring
to
know
and
she
had
not
even
begun
to
think
what
she
should
do
that
seemed
a
sort
of
affront
to
her
godmother
memory
at
all
events
until
some
one
had
made
it
clear
to
her
but
now
in
a
moment
with
her
first
consciousness
of
the
importance
of
this
matter
in
the
sight
of
others
a
consciousness
of
what
it
was
to
herself
came
into
her
mind
a
change
of
everything
a
new
life
a
new
world
and
not
only
so
but
a
severance
from
the
old
world
a
giving
up
of
everything
that
had
been
most
near
and
pleasant
to
her
these
thoughts
were
driven
through
her
mind
like
the
snowflakes
in
a
storm
the
year
had
slid
on
since
lady
mary
death
winter
was
beginning
to
yield
to
spring
the
snow
was
over
and
the
great
cold
and
other
changes
had
taken
place
the
great
house
had
been
let
and
the
family
who
had
taken
it
had
been
about
a
week
in
possession
their
coming
had
inflicted
a
wound
upon
mary
heart
but
everybody
had
urged
upon
her
the
idea
that
it
was
much
better
the
house
should
be
let
for
a
time
till
everything
was
settled
when
all
was
settled
things
would
be
different
vicar
did
not
say
you
can
then
do
what
you
please
but
she
did
convey
to
mary
mind
somehow
a
sort
of
inference
that
she
would
have
something
to
do
it
with
and
when
mary
had
protested
it
shall
never
be
let
again
with
my
will
the
kind
woman
had
said
tremulously
well
my
dear
and
had
changed
the
subject
all
these
things
now
came
to
mind
they
had
been
afraid
to
tell
her
they
had
thought
it
would
be
so
much
to
her
so
important
such
a
crushing
blow
to
have
nothing
to
be
destitute
to
be
written
about
by
furnival
to
the
earl
to
have
her
case
represented
mary
felt
herself
stung
by
such
unendurable
suggestions
into
an
energy
a
determination
of
which
her
soft
young
life
had
known
nothing
no
one
should
write
about
her
or
ask
charity
for
her
she
said
to
herself
she
had
gone
through
the
woods
and
round
the
park
which
was
not
large
and
now
she
could
not
leave
these
beloved
precincts
without
going
to
look
at
the
house
up
to
this
time
she
had
not
had
the
courage
to
go
near
the
house
but
to
the
commotion
and
fever
of
her
mind
every
violent
sensation
was
congenial
and
she
went
up
the
avenue
now
almost
gladly
with
a
little
demonstration
to
herself
of
energy
and
courage
why
not
that
as
well
as
all
the
rest
it
was
once
more
twilight
and
the
dimness
favored
her
design
she
wanted
to
go
there
unseen
to
look
up
at
the
windows
with
their
alien
lights
and
to
think
of
the
time
when
lady
mary
sat
behind
the
curtains
and
there
was
nothing
but
tenderness
and
peace
throughout
the
house
there
was
a
light
in
every
window
along
the
entire
front
a
lavishness
of
firelight
and
lamplight
which
told
of
a
household
in
which
there
were
many
inhabitants
mary
mind
was
so
deeply
absorbed
and
perhaps
her
eyes
so
dim
with
tears
that
she
could
scarcely
see
what
was
before
her
when
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
a
lady
came
out
i
will
go
myself
she
said
in
an
agitated
tone
to
some
one
behind
her
do
get
yourself
laughed
at
said
a
voice
from
within
the
sound
of
the
voices
roused
the
young
spectator
she
looked
with
a
little
curiosity
mixed
with
anxiety
at
the
lady
who
had
come
out
of
the
house
and
who
started
too
with
a
gesture
of
alarm
when
she
saw
mary
move
in
the
dark
who
are
you
she
cried
out
in
a
trembling
voice
and
what
do
you
want
here
then
mary
made
a
step
or
two
forward
and
said
i
must
ask
your
pardon
if
i
am
trespassing
i
did
not
know
there
was
any
objection
this
stranger
to
make
an
objection
it
brought
something
like
a
tremulous
laugh
to
mary
lips
oh
there
is
no
objection
said
the
lady
only
we
have
been
a
little
put
out
i
see
now
you
are
the
young
lady
who
you
are
the
young
lady
that
you
are
the
one
that
suffered
most
i
am
lady
mary
goddaughter
said
the
girl
i
have
lived
here
all
my
life
oh
my
dear
i
have
heard
all
about
you
the
lady
cried
the
people
who
had
taken
the
house
were
merely
rich
people
they
had
no
other
characteristic
and
in
the
vicarage
as
well
as
in
the
other
houses
about
it
was
said
when
they
were
spoken
of
that
it
was
a
good
thing
they
were
not
people
to
be
visited
since
nobody
could
have
had
the
heart
to
visit
strangers
in
lady
mary
house
and
mary
could
not
but
feel
a
keen
resentment
to
think
that
her
story
such
as
it
was
the
story
which
she
had
only
now
heard
in
her
own
person
should
be
discussed
by
such
people
but
the
speaker
had
a
look
of
kindness
and
so
far
as
could
be
seen
of
perplexity
and
fretted
anxiety
in
her
face
and
had
been
in
a
hurry
but
stopped
herself
in
order
to
show
her
interest
i
wonder
she
said
impulsively
that
you
can
come
here
and
look
at
the
place
again
after
all
that
has
passed
i
never
thought
said
mary
that
there
could
be
any
objection
oh
how
can
you
think
i
mean
that
how
can
you
pretend
to
think
so
cried
the
other
impatiently
but
after
you
have
been
treated
so
heartlessly
so
unkindly
and
left
poor
thing
they
tell
me
without
a
penny
without
any
provision
i
do
know
you
cried
mary
breathless
with
quick
rising
passion
i
do
know
what
right
you
can
have
to
meddle
with
my
affairs
the
lady
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
without
speaking
and
then
she
said
all
at
once
that
is
quite
true
but
it
is
rude
as
well
for
though
i
have
no
right
to
meddle
with
your
affairs
i
did
it
in
kindness
because
i
took
an
interest
in
you
from
all
i
have
heard
mary
was
very
accessible
to
such
a
reproach
and
argument
her
face
flushed
with
a
sense
of
her
own
churlishness
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
i
am
sure
you
mean
to
be
kind
well
said
the
stranger
that
is
perhaps
going
too
far
on
the
other
side
for
you
ca
even
see
my
face
to
know
what
i
mean
but
i
do
mean
to
be
kind
and
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
and
though
i
think
you
been
treated
abominably
all
the
same
i
like
you
better
for
not
allowing
any
one
to
say
so
and
now
do
you
know
where
i
was
going
i
was
going
to
the
vicarage
where
you
are
living
i
believe
to
see
if
the
vicar
or
his
wife
or
you
or
all
of
you
together
could
do
a
thing
for
me
oh
i
am
sure
bowyer
said
mary
with
a
voice
much
less
assured
than
her
words
you
must
not
be
too
sure
my
dear
i
know
she
does
mean
to
call
upon
me
because
my
husband
is
a
city
man
that
is
just
as
she
pleases
i
am
not
very
fond
of
city
men
myself
but
there
no
reason
why
i
should
stand
on
ceremony
when
i
want
something
is
there
now
my
dear
i
want
to
know
do
laugh
at
me
i
am
not
superstitious
so
far
as
i
am
aware
but
tell
me
in
your
time
was
there
ever
any
disturbance
any
appearance
you
could
understand
any
well
i
do
like
the
word
ghost
disrespectful
if
there
anything
of
the
sort
and
it
vulgar
if
there
is
but
you
know
what
i
mean
was
there
anything
of
that
sort
in
your
time
in
your
time
poor
mary
had
scarcely
realized
yet
that
her
time
was
over
her
heart
refused
to
allow
it
when
it
was
thus
so
abruptly
brought
before
her
but
she
obliged
herself
to
subdue
these
rising
rebellions
and
to
answer
though
with
some
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
that
i
ever
heard
of
there
is
no
superstition
or
ghost
in
our
house
she
thought
it
was
the
vulgar
desire
of
new
people
to
find
a
conventional
mystery
and
it
seemed
to
mary
that
this
was
a
desecration
of
her
home
turner
however
for
that
was
her
name
did
not
receive
the
intimation
as
the
girl
expected
but
looked
at
her
very
gravely
and
said
that
makes
it
a
great
deal
more
serious
as
if
to
herself
she
paused
and
then
added
you
see
the
case
is
this
i
have
a
little
girl
who
is
our
youngest
who
is
just
my
husband
idol
she
is
a
sweet
little
thing
though
perhaps
i
should
not
say
it
are
you
fond
of
children
then
i
almost
feel
sure
you
would
think
so
too
not
a
moping
child
at
all
or
too
clever
or
anything
to
alarm
one
well
you
know
little
connie
since
ever
we
came
in
has
seen
an
old
lady
walking
about
the
house
an
old
lady
said
mary
with
an
involuntary
smile
oh
yes
i
laughed
too
the
first
time
i
said
it
would
be
old
prentiss
or
perhaps
the
or
some
old
lady
from
the
village
that
had
been
in
the
habit
of
coming
in
the
former
people
time
but
the
child
got
very
angry
she
said
it
was
a
real
lady
she
would
not
allow
me
to
speak
then
we
thought
perhaps
it
was
some
one
who
did
not
know
the
house
was
let
and
had
walked
in
to
look
at
it
but
nobody
would
go
on
coming
like
that
with
all
the
signs
of
a
large
family
in
the
house
and
now
the
doctor
says
the
child
must
be
low
that
the
place
perhaps
agree
with
her
and
that
we
must
send
her
away
now
i
ask
you
how
could
i
send
little
connie
away
the
apple
of
her
father
eye
i
should
have
to
go
with
her
of
course
and
how
could
the
house
get
on
without
me
naturally
we
are
very
anxious
and
this
afternoon
she
has
seen
her
again
and
sits
there
crying
because
she
says
the
dear
old
lady
looks
so
sad
i
just
seized
my
hat
and
walked
out
to
come
to
you
and
your
friends
at
the
vicarage
to
see
if
you
could
help
me
bowyer
may
look
down
upon
a
city
person
i
do
mind
that
but
she
is
a
mother
and
surely
she
would
feel
for
a
mother
cried
the
poor
lady
vehemently
putting
up
her
hands
to
her
wet
eyes
oh
indeed
indeed
she
would
i
am
sure
now
that
she
will
call
directly
we
did
not
know
what
a
mary
stopped
herself
in
saying
what
a
nice
woman
you
are
which
she
thought
would
be
rude
though
poor
turner
would
have
liked
it
but
then
she
shook
her
head
and
added
what
could
any
of
us
do
to
help
you
i
have
never
heard
of
any
old
lady
there
never
was
anything
i
know
all
about
the
house
everything
that
has
ever
happened
and
prentiss
will
tell
you
there
is
nothing
of
that
kind
indeed
there
is
nothing
you
must
have
but
here
mary
stopped
again
for
to
suggest
that
a
new
family
a
city
family
should
have
brought
an
apparition
of
their
own
with
them
was
too
ridiculous
an
idea
to
be
entertained
miss
vivian
said
turner
will
you
come
back
with
me
and
speak
to
the
child
at
this
mary
faltered
a
little
i
have
never
been
there
since
the
funeral
she
said
the
good
woman
laid
a
kind
hand
upon
her
shoulder
caressing
and
soothing
you
were
very
fond
of
her
in
spite
of
the
way
she
has
used
you
oh
how
dare
you
or
any
one
to
speak
of
her
so
she
used
me
as
if
i
had
been
her
dearest
child
she
was
more
kind
to
me
than
a
mother
there
is
no
one
in
the
world
like
her
mary
cried
and
yet
she
left
you
without
a
penny
oh
you
must
be
a
good
girl
to
feel
for
her
like
that
she
left
you
without
what
are
you
going
to
do
my
dear
i
feel
like
a
friend
i
feel
like
a
mother
to
you
though
you
do
know
me
you
must
think
it
is
only
curiosity
you
ca
stay
with
your
friends
for
ever
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
there
are
some
cases
in
which
it
is
more
easy
to
speak
to
a
stranger
than
to
one
dearest
and
oldest
friend
mary
had
felt
this
when
she
rushed
out
not
knowing
how
to
tell
the
vicar
wife
that
she
must
leave
her
and
find
some
independence
for
herself
it
was
however
strange
to
rush
into
such
a
discussion
with
so
little
warning
and
mary
pride
was
very
sensitive
she
said
i
am
not
going
to
burden
my
friends
with
a
little
indignation
but
then
she
remembered
how
forlorn
she
was
and
her
voice
softened
i
must
do
something
but
i
do
know
what
i
am
good
for
she
said
trembling
and
on
the
verge
of
tears
my
dear
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
you
said
the
stranger
it
is
not
rash
though
it
may
look
so
come
back
with
me
directly
and
see
connie
she
is
a
very
interesting
little
thing
though
i
say
it
it
is
wonderful
sometimes
to
hear
her
talk
you
shall
be
her
governess
my
dear
oh
you
need
not
teach
her
anything
that
is
not
what
i
mean
i
think
i
am
sure
you
will
be
the
saving
of
her
miss
vivian
and
such
a
lady
as
you
are
it
will
be
everything
for
the
other
girls
to
live
with
you
do
stop
to
think
but
just
come
with
me
you
shall
have
whatever
you
please
and
always
be
treated
like
a
lady
oh
my
dear
consider
my
feelings
as
a
mother
and
come
oh
come
to
connie
i
know
you
will
save
her
it
is
an
inspiration
come
back
come
back
with
me
it
seemed
to
mary
too
like
an
inspiration
what
it
cost
her
to
cross
that
threshold
and
walk
in
a
stranger
to
the
house
which
had
been
all
her
life
as
her
own
she
never
said
to
any
one
but
it
was
independence
it
was
deliverance
from
entreaties
and
remonstrances
without
end
it
was
a
kind
of
setting
right
so
far
as
could
be
of
the
balance
which
had
got
so
terribly
wrong
no
writing
to
the
earl
now
no
appeal
to
friends
anything
in
all
the
world
much
more
honest
service
and
kindness
must
be
better
than
that
viii
tell
the
young
lady
all
about
it
connie
said
her
mother
but
connie
was
very
reluctant
to
tell
she
was
very
shy
and
clung
to
her
mother
and
hid
her
face
in
her
ample
dress
and
though
presently
she
was
beguiled
by
mary
voice
and
in
a
short
time
came
to
her
side
and
clung
to
her
as
she
had
clung
to
turner
she
still
kept
her
secret
to
herself
they
were
all
very
kind
to
mary
the
elder
girls
standing
round
in
a
respectful
circle
looking
at
her
while
their
mother
exhorted
them
to
take
a
pattern
by
miss
vivian
the
novelty
the
awe
which
she
inspired
the
real
kindness
about
her
ended
in
overcoming
in
young
mind
the
first
miserable
impression
of
such
a
return
to
her
home
it
gave
her
a
kind
of
pleasure
to
write
to
bowyer
that
she
had
found
employment
and
had
thought
it
better
to
accept
it
at
once
do
be
angry
with
me
and
i
think
you
will
understand
me
she
said
and
then
she
gave
herself
up
to
the
strange
new
scene
the
ways
of
the
large
family
homely
yet
kindly
so
transformed
lady
mary
graceful
old
rooms
that
they
no
longer
looked
the
same
place
and
when
mary
sat
down
with
them
at
the
big
table
surrounded
with
the
hum
of
so
large
a
party
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
believe
that
everything
was
not
new
about
her
in
no
way
could
the
saddening
recollections
of
a
home
from
which
the
chief
figure
had
disappeared
have
been
more
completely
broken
up
afterwards
turner
took
her
aside
and
begged
to
know
which
was
mary
old
room
for
i
should
like
to
put
you
there
as
if
nothing
had
happened
oh
do
not
put
me
there
mary
cried
so
much
has
happened
but
this
seemed
a
refinement
to
the
kind
woman
which
it
was
far
better
for
her
young
guest
not
to
yield
to
the
room
mary
had
occupied
had
been
next
to
her
godmother
with
a
door
between
and
when
it
turned
out
that
connie
with
an
elder
sister
was
in
lady
mary
room
everything
seemed
perfectly
arranged
in
turner
eyes
she
thought
it
was
providential
with
a
simple
belief
in
mary
powers
that
in
other
circumstances
would
have
been
amusing
but
there
was
no
amusement
in
mary
mind
when
she
took
possession
of
the
old
room
as
if
nothing
had
happened
she
sat
by
the
fire
for
half
the
night
in
an
agony
of
silent
recollection
and
thought
going
over
the
last
days
of
her
godmother
life
calling
up
everything
before
her
and
realizing
as
she
had
never
realized
till
now
the
lonely
career
on
which
she
was
setting
out
the
subjection
to
the
will
and
convenience
of
strangers
in
which
henceforth
her
life
must
be
passed
this
was
a
kind
woman
who
had
opened
her
doors
to
the
destitute
girl
but
notwithstanding
however
great
the
torture
to
mary
there
was
no
escaping
this
room
which
was
haunted
by
the
saddest
recollections
of
her
life
of
such
things
she
must
no
longer
complain
nay
she
must
think
of
nothing
but
thanking
the
mistress
of
the
house
for
her
thoughtfulness
for
the
wish
to
be
kind
which
so
often
exceeds
the
performance
the
room
was
warm
and
well
lighted
the
night
was
very
calm
and
sweet
outside
nothing
had
been
touched
or
changed
of
all
her
little
decorations
the
ornaments
which
had
been
so
delightful
to
her
girlhood
a
large
photograph
of
lady
mary
held
the
chief
place
over
the
representing
her
in
the
fullness
of
her
beauty
a
photograph
which
had
been
taken
from
the
picture
painted
ages
ago
by
a
royal
academician
it
fortunately
was
so
little
like
lady
mary
in
her
old
age
that
save
as
a
thing
which
had
always
hung
there
and
belonged
to
her
happier
life
it
did
not
affect
the
girl
but
no
picture
was
necessary
to
bring
before
her
the
figure
she
could
not
realize
that
the
little
movements
she
heard
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
were
any
other
than
those
of
her
mistress
her
friend
her
mother
for
all
these
names
mary
lavished
upon
her
in
the
fullness
of
her
heart
the
blame
that
was
being
cast
upon
lady
mary
from
all
sides
made
this
child
of
her
bounty
but
more
deeply
her
partisan
more
warm
in
her
adoration
she
would
not
for
all
the
inheritances
of
the
world
have
acknowledged
even
to
herself
that
lady
mary
was
in
fault
mary
felt
that
she
would
rather
a
thousand
times
be
poor
and
have
to
gain
her
daily
bread
than
that
she
who
had
nourished
and
cherished
her
should
have
been
forced
in
her
cheerful
old
age
to
think
before
she
chose
to
do
so
of
parting
and
farewell
and
the
inevitable
end
she
thought
like
every
young
creature
in
strange
and
painful
circumstances
that
she
would
be
unable
to
sleep
and
did
indeed
lie
awake
and
weep
for
an
hour
or
more
thinking
of
all
the
changes
that
had
happened
but
sleep
overtook
her
before
she
knew
while
her
mind
was
still
full
of
these
thoughts
and
her
dreams
were
endless
confused
full
of
misery
and
longing
she
dreamed
a
dozen
times
over
that
she
heard
lady
mary
soft
call
through
the
open
door
which
was
not
open
but
shut
closely
and
locked
by
the
sisters
who
now
inhabited
the
next
room
and
once
she
dreamed
that
lady
mary
came
to
her
bedside
and
stood
there
looking
at
her
earnestly
with
the
tears
flowing
from
her
eyes
mary
struggled
in
her
sleep
to
tell
her
benefactress
how
she
loved
her
and
approved
of
all
she
had
done
and
wanted
nothing
but
felt
herself
bound
as
by
a
nightmare
so
that
she
could
not
move
or
speak
or
even
put
out
a
hand
to
dry
those
tears
which
it
was
intolerable
to
her
to
see
and
woke
with
the
struggle
and
the
miserable
sensation
of
seeing
her
dearest
friend
weep
and
being
unable
to
comfort
her
the
moon
was
shining
into
the
room
throwing
part
of
it
into
a
cold
full
light
while
blackness
lay
in
all
corners
the
impression
of
her
dream
was
so
strong
that
mary
eyes
turned
instantly
to
the
spot
where
in
her
dream
her
godmother
had
stood
to
be
sure
there
was
nobody
there
but
as
her
consciousness
returned
and
with
it
the
sweep
of
painful
recollection
the
sense
of
change
the
miserable
contrast
between
the
present
and
the
past
sleep
fled
from
her
eyes
she
fell
into
the
vividly
awake
condition
which
is
the
alternative
of
broken
sleep
and
gradually
as
she
lay
there
came
upon
her
that
mysterious
sense
of
another
presence
in
the
room
which
is
so
subtle
and
indescribable
she
neither
saw
anything
nor
heard
anything
and
yet
she
felt
that
some
one
was
there
she
lay
still
for
some
time
and
held
her
breath
listening
for
a
movement
even
for
the
sound
of
breathing
scarcely
alarmed
yet
sure
that
she
was
not
alone
after
a
while
she
raised
herself
on
her
pillow
and
in
a
low
voice
asked
who
is
there
is
any
one
there
there
was
no
reply
no
sound
of
any
description
and
yet
the
conviction
grew
upon
her
her
heart
began
to
beat
and
the
blood
to
mount
to
her
head
her
own
being
made
so
much
sound
so
much
commotion
that
it
seemed
to
her
she
could
not
hear
anything
save
those
beatings
and
pulsings
yet
she
was
not
afraid
after
a
time
however
the
oppression
became
more
than
she
could
bear
she
got
up
and
lit
her
candle
and
searched
through
the
familiar
room
but
she
found
no
trace
that
any
one
had
been
there
the
furniture
was
all
in
its
usual
order
there
was
no
where
any
human
thing
could
find
refuge
when
she
had
satisfied
herself
and
was
about
to
return
to
bed
suppressing
a
sensation
which
must
she
said
to
herself
be
altogether
fantastic
she
was
startled
by
a
low
knocking
at
the
door
of
communication
then
she
heard
the
voice
of
the
elder
girl
oh
miss
vivian
what
is
it
have
you
seen
anything
a
new
sense
of
anger
disdain
humiliation
swept
through
mary
mind
and
if
she
had
seen
anything
she
said
to
herself
what
was
that
to
those
strangers
she
replied
no
nothing
what
should
i
see
in
a
tone
which
was
almost
haughty
in
spite
of
herself
i
thought
it
might
be
the
ghost
oh
please
do
be
angry
i
thought
i
heard
this
door
open
but
it
is
locked
oh
perhaps
it
is
very
silly
but
i
am
so
frightened
miss
vivian
go
back
to
bed
said
mary
there
is
no
ghost
i
am
going
to
sit
up
and
write
some
letters
you
will
see
my
light
under
the
door
oh
thank
you
cried
the
girl
mary
remembered
what
a
consolation
and
strength
in
all
wakefulness
had
been
the
glimmer
of
the
light
under
her
godmother
door
she
smiled
to
think
that
she
herself
so
desolate
as
she
was
was
able
to
afford
this
innocent
comfort
to
another
girl
and
then
sat
down
and
wept
quietly
feeling
her
solitude
and
the
chill
about
her
and
the
dark
and
the
silence
the
moon
had
gone
behind
a
cloud
there
seemed
no
light
but
her
small
miserable
candle
in
earth
and
heaven
and
yet
that
poor
little
speck
of
light
kept
up
the
heart
of
another
which
made
her
smile
again
in
the
middle
of
her
tears
and
the
commotion
in
her
head
and
heart
calmed
down
and
she
too
fell
asleep
next
day
she
heard
all
the
floating
legends
that
were
beginning
to
rise
in
the
house
they
all
arose
from
connie
questions
about
the
old
lady
whom
she
had
seen
going
before
her
the
first
evening
after
the
new
family
arrival
it
was
in
the
presence
of
the
doctor
who
had
come
to
see
the
child
and
whose
surprise
at
finding
mary
there
was
almost
ludicrous
that
she
heard
the
story
though
much
against
his
will
there
can
be
no
need
for
troubling
miss
vivian
about
it
he
said
in
a
tone
which
was
almost
rude
but
turner
was
not
sensitive
when
miss
vivian
has
just
come
like
a
dear
to
help
us
with
connie
the
good
woman
cried
of
course
she
must
hear
it
doctor
for
otherwise
how
could
she
know
what
to
do
is
it
true
that
you
have
come
here
to
help
good
heavens
miss
mary
why
not
here
mary
said
smiling
as
but
she
could
i
am
governess
doctor
he
burst
out
into
that
suppressed
roar
which
serves
a
man
instead
of
tears
and
jumped
up
from
his
seat
clenching
his
fist
the
clenched
fist
was
to
the
intention
of
the
dead
woman
whose
fault
this
was
and
if
it
had
ever
entered
the
doctor
mind
as
his
mother
supposed
to
marry
this
forlorn
child
and
thus
bestow
a
home
upon
her
whether
she
would
or
no
no
doubt
he
would
now
have
attempted
to
carry
out
that
plan
but
as
no
such
thing
had
occurred
to
him
the
doctor
only
showed
his
sense
of
the
intolerable
by
look
and
gesture
i
must
speak
to
the
vicar
i
must
see
furnival
it
ca
be
permitted
he
cried
do
you
think
i
shall
not
be
kind
to
her
doctor
cried
turner
oh
ask
her
she
is
one
that
understands
she
knows
far
better
than
that
we
not
fine
people
doctor
but
we
kind
people
i
can
say
that
for
myself
there
is
nobody
in
this
house
but
will
be
good
to
her
and
admire
her
and
take
an
example
by
her
to
have
a
real
lady
with
the
girls
that
is
what
i
would
give
anything
for
and
as
she
wants
taking
care
of
poor
dear
and
petting
and
an
mary
who
would
not
hear
any
more
got
up
hastily
and
took
the
hand
of
her
new
protectress
and
kissed
her
partly
out
of
gratitude
and
kindness
partly
to
stop
her
mouth
and
prevent
the
saying
of
something
which
it
might
have
been
still
more
difficult
to
support
you
are
a
real
lady
yourself
dear
turner
she
cried
and
this
notwithstanding
the
one
deficient
letter
but
many
people
who
are
much
more
dignified
than
turner
people
who
behave
themselves
very
well
in
every
other
respect
say
oh
my
dear
i
do
make
any
pretensions
the
good
woman
cried
but
with
a
little
shock
of
pleasure
which
brought
the
tears
to
her
eyes
and
then
the
story
was
told
connie
had
seen
the
lady
walk
and
had
thought
no
harm
the
child
supposed
it
was
some
one
belonging
to
the
house
she
had
gone
into
the
room
which
was
now
connie
room
but
as
that
had
a
second
door
there
was
no
suspicion
caused
by
the
fact
that
she
was
not
found
there
a
little
time
after
when
the
child
told
her
mother
what
she
had
seen
after
this
connie
had
seen
the
same
lady
several
times
and
once
had
met
her
face
to
face
the
child
declared
that
she
was
not
at
all
afraid
she
was
a
pretty
old
lady
with
white
hair
and
dark
eyes
she
looked
a
little
sad
but
smiled
when
connie
stopped
and
stared
at
her
not
angry
at
all
but
rather
pleased
and
looked
for
a
moment
as
if
she
would
speak
that
was
all
not
a
word
about
a
ghost
was
said
in
connie
hearing
she
had
already
told
it
all
to
the
doctor
and
he
had
pretended
to
consider
which
of
the
old
ladies
in
the
neighborhood
this
could
be
in
mary
mind
occupied
as
it
was
by
so
many
important
matters
there
had
been
up
to
this
time
no
great
question
about
apparition
now
she
began
to
listen
closely
not
so
much
from
real
interest
as
from
a
perception
that
the
doctor
who
was
her
friend
did
not
want
her
to
hear
this
naturally
aroused
her
attention
at
once
she
listened
to
the
child
description
with
growing
eagerness
all
the
more
because
the
doctor
opposed
now
that
will
do
miss
connie
he
said
it
is
one
of
the
old
miss
murchisons
who
are
always
so
fond
of
finding
out
about
their
neighbors
i
have
no
doubt
at
all
on
that
subject
she
wants
to
find
you
out
in
your
pet
naughtiness
whatever
it
is
and
tell
me
i
am
sure
it
is
not
for
that
cried
connie
oh
how
can
you
be
so
disagreeable
i
know
she
is
not
a
lady
who
would
tell
besides
she
is
not
thinking
at
all
about
me
she
was
either
looking
for
something
she
had
lost
or
oh
i
do
know
what
it
was
and
when
she
saw
me
she
just
smiled
she
is
not
dressed
like
any
of
the
people
here
she
had
got
no
cloak
on
or
bonnet
or
anything
that
is
common
but
a
beautiful
white
shawl
and
a
long
dress
and
it
gives
a
little
sweep
when
she
walks
oh
no
not
like
your
rustling
mamma
but
all
soft
like
water
and
it
looks
like
lace
upon
her
head
tied
here
said
connie
putting
her
hands
to
her
chin
in
such
a
pretty
large
soft
knot
mary
had
gradually
risen
as
this
description
went
on
starting
a
little
at
first
looking
up
getting
upon
her
feet
the
color
went
altogether
out
of
her
face
her
eyes
grew
to
twice
their
natural
size
the
doctor
put
out
his
hand
without
looking
at
her
and
laid
it
on
her
arm
with
a
strong
emphatic
pressure
just
like
some
one
you
have
seen
a
picture
of
he
said
oh
no
i
never
saw
a
picture
that
was
so
pretty
said
the
child
doctor
why
do
you
ask
her
any
more
do
you
see
do
you
see
the
child
has
seen
miss
mary
for
god
sake
hold
your
tongue
it
is
folly
you
know
now
my
little
girl
tell
me
i
know
this
old
lady
is
the
very
image
of
that
pretty
old
lady
with
the
toys
for
good
children
who
was
in
the
last
christmas
number
oh
said
connie
pausing
a
little
yes
i
remember
it
was
a
very
pretty
picture
mamma
put
it
up
in
the
nursery
no
she
is
not
like
that
not
at
all
much
prettier
and
then
lady
is
sorry
about
something
except
when
she
smiles
at
me
she
has
her
hair
put
up
like
this
and
this
the
child
went
on
twisting
her
own
bright
locks
doctor
i
ca
bear
any
more
my
dear
you
are
mistaken
it
is
all
a
delusion
she
has
seen
a
picture
i
think
now
turner
that
my
little
patient
had
better
run
away
and
play
take
a
good
run
through
the
woods
miss
connie
with
your
brother
and
i
will
send
you
some
physic
which
will
not
be
at
all
nasty
and
we
shall
hear
no
more
of
your
old
lady
my
dear
miss
vivian
if
you
will
but
hear
reason
i
have
known
such
cases
a
hundred
times
the
child
has
seen
a
picture
and
it
has
taken
possession
of
her
imagination
she
is
a
little
below
par
and
she
has
a
lively
imagination
and
she
has
learned
something
from
prentiss
though
probably
she
does
not
remember
that
and
there
it
is
a
few
doses
of
quinine
and
she
will
see
visions
no
more
doctor
cried
mary
how
can
you
speak
so
to
me
you
dare
not
look
me
in
the
face
you
know
you
dare
not
as
if
you
did
not
know
as
well
as
i
do
oh
why
does
that
child
see
her
and
not
me
there
it
is
he
said
with
a
broken
laugh
could
anything
show
better
that
it
is
a
mere
delusion
why
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
reasonable
should
this
stranger
child
see
her
if
it
was
anything
and
not
you
turner
looked
from
one
to
another
with
wondering
eyes
you
know
what
it
is
she
said
oh
you
know
what
it
is
doctor
doctor
is
it
because
my
connie
is
so
delicate
is
it
a
warning
is
it
oh
for
heaven
sake
you
will
drive
me
mad
you
ladies
is
it
this
and
is
it
that
it
is
nothing
i
tell
you
the
child
is
out
of
sorts
and
she
has
seen
some
picture
that
has
caught
her
fancy
and
she
thinks
she
sees
i
send
her
a
bottle
he
cried
jumping
up
that
will
put
an
end
to
all
that
doctor
do
go
away
tell
me
rather
what
i
must
do
if
she
is
looking
for
something
oh
doctor
think
if
she
were
unhappy
if
she
were
kept
out
of
her
sweet
rest
miss
mary
for
god
sake
be
reasonable
you
ought
never
to
have
heard
a
word
doctor
think
if
it
should
be
anything
we
can
do
oh
tell
me
tell
me
do
go
away
and
leave
me
perhaps
we
can
find
out
what
it
is
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
your
findings
out
it
is
mere
delusion
put
them
both
to
bed
turner
put
them
all
to
bed
as
if
there
was
not
trouble
enough
what
is
it
cried
connie
mother
is
it
a
warning
oh
for
the
love
of
god
tell
me
is
that
what
comes
before
a
death
when
they
were
all
in
this
state
of
agitation
the
vicar
and
his
wife
were
suddenly
shown
into
the
room
bowyer
eyes
flew
to
mary
but
she
was
too
well
bred
a
woman
not
to
pay
her
respects
first
to
the
lady
of
the
house
and
there
were
a
number
of
politenesses
exchanged
very
breathlessly
on
turner
part
before
the
were
free
to
show
the
real
occasion
of
their
visit
oh
mary
what
did
you
mean
by
taking
such
a
step
all
in
a
moment
how
could
you
come
here
of
all
places
in
the
world
and
how
could
you
leave
me
without
a
word
the
vicar
wife
said
with
her
lips
against
mary
cheek
she
had
already
perceived
without
dwelling
upon
it
the
excitement
in
which
all
the
party
were
this
was
said
while
the
vicar
was
still
making
his
bow
to
his
new
parishioner
who
knew
very
well
that
her
visitors
had
not
intended
to
call
for
the
turners
were
dissenters
to
crown
all
their
misdemeanors
beside
being
city
people
and
do
ask
me
any
questions
just
now
said
mary
clasping
almost
hysterically
her
friend
hand
it
was
providential
come
and
hear
what
the
child
has
seen
turner
though
she
was
so
anxious
was
too
polite
not
to
make
a
fuss
about
getting
chairs
for
all
her
visitors
she
postponed
her
own
trouble
to
this
necessity
and
trembling
sought
the
most
comfortable
seat
for
bowyer
the
largest
and
most
imposing
for
the
vicar
himself
when
she
had
established
them
in
a
little
circle
and
done
her
best
to
draw
mary
too
into
a
chair
she
sat
down
quietly
her
mind
divided
between
the
cares
of
courtesy
and
the
alarms
of
an
anxious
mother
mary
stood
at
the
table
and
waited
till
the
commotion
was
over
the
thought
she
was
going
to
explain
her
conduct
in
leaving
them
and
bowyer
at
least
who
was
critical
in
point
of
manners
shivered
a
little
wondering
if
perhaps
though
she
could
not
find
it
in
her
heart
to
blame
mary
her
proceedings
were
in
perfect
taste
the
little
girl
mary
said
beginning
abruptly
she
had
been
standing
by
the
table
her
lips
apart
her
countenance
utterly
pale
her
mind
evidently
too
much
absorbed
to
notice
anything
the
little
girl
has
seen
several
times
a
lady
going
once
she
met
her
and
saw
her
face
and
the
lady
smiled
at
her
but
her
face
was
sorrowful
and
the
child
thought
she
was
looking
for
something
the
lady
was
old
with
white
hair
done
up
upon
her
forehead
and
lace
upon
her
head
she
was
dressed
here
mary
voice
began
to
be
interrupted
from
time
to
time
by
a
brief
sob
in
a
long
dress
that
made
a
soft
sound
when
she
walked
and
a
white
shawl
and
the
lace
tied
under
her
chin
in
a
large
soft
knot
mary
mary
bowyer
had
risen
and
stood
behind
the
girl
in
whose
slender
throat
the
climbing
sorrow
was
almost
visible
supporting
her
trying
to
stop
her
mary
mary
she
cried
oh
my
darling
what
are
you
thinking
of
francis
doctor
make
her
stop
make
her
stop
why
should
she
stop
said
turner
rising
too
in
her
agitation
oh
is
it
a
warning
is
it
a
warning
for
my
child
has
seen
it
connie
has
seen
it
listen
to
me
all
of
you
said
mary
with
an
effort
you
all
know
who
that
is
and
she
has
seen
her
the
little
girl
now
the
others
looked
at
each
other
exchanging
a
startled
look
my
dear
people
cried
the
doctor
the
case
is
not
the
least
unusual
no
no
turner
it
is
no
warning
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort
look
here
bowyer
you
believe
me
the
child
is
very
nervous
and
sensitive
she
has
evidently
seen
a
picture
somewhere
of
our
dear
old
friend
she
has
heard
the
story
somehow
oh
perhaps
in
some
garbled
version
from
prentiss
or
of
course
they
all
been
talking
of
it
and
the
child
is
one
of
those
creatures
with
its
nerves
all
on
the
surface
and
a
little
below
par
in
health
in
need
of
iron
and
quinine
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
seen
a
hundred
such
cases
cried
the
doctor
a
thousand
such
but
now
of
course
we
have
a
fine
story
made
of
it
now
that
it
come
into
the
ladies
hands
he
was
much
excited
with
this
long
speech
but
it
can
not
be
said
that
any
one
paid
much
attention
to
him
bowyer
was
holding
mary
in
her
arms
uttering
little
cries
and
sobs
over
her
and
looking
anxiously
at
her
husband
the
vicar
sat
down
suddenly
in
his
chair
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
judgment
to
deliver
without
the
least
idea
what
to
say
while
mary
freeing
herself
unconsciously
from
her
friend
restraining
embrace
stood
facing
them
all
with
a
sort
of
trembling
defiance
and
turner
kept
on
explaining
nervously
that
no
no
her
connie
was
not
excitable
was
not
oversensitive
had
never
known
what
a
delusion
was
this
is
very
strange
the
vicar
said
oh
bowyer
cried
mary
tell
me
what
i
am
to
do
think
if
she
can
not
rest
if
she
is
not
happy
she
that
was
so
good
to
everybody
that
never
could
bear
to
see
any
one
in
trouble
oh
tell
me
tell
me
what
i
am
to
do
it
is
you
that
have
disturbed
her
with
all
you
have
been
saying
oh
what
can
i
do
what
can
i
do
to
give
her
rest
my
dear
mary
my
dear
mary
they
all
cried
in
different
tones
of
consternation
and
for
a
few
minutes
no
one
could
speak
bowyer
as
was
natural
said
something
being
unable
to
endure
the
silence
but
neither
she
nor
any
of
the
others
knew
what
it
was
she
said
when
it
was
evident
that
the
vicar
must
speak
all
were
silent
waiting
for
him
and
though
it
now
became
imperative
that
something
in
the
shape
of
a
judgment
must
be
delivered
yet
he
was
as
far
as
ever
from
knowing
what
to
say
mary
he
said
with
a
little
tremulousness
of
voice
it
is
quite
natural
that
you
should
ask
me
but
my
dear
i
am
not
at
all
prepared
to
answer
i
think
you
know
that
the
doctor
who
ought
to
know
best
about
such
matters
nay
not
i
only
know
about
the
physical
the
other
if
there
is
another
that
your
concern
who
ought
to
know
best
repeated
bowyer
for
every
body
will
tell
you
my
dear
that
the
mind
is
so
dependent
upon
the
body
i
suppose
he
must
be
right
i
suppose
it
is
just
the
imagination
of
a
nervous
child
working
upon
the
data
which
have
been
given
the
picture
and
then
as
you
justly
remind
me
all
we
have
been
saying
how
could
the
child
know
what
we
have
been
saying
francis
connie
has
heard
nothing
that
any
one
has
been
saying
and
there
is
no
picture
my
dear
lady
you
hear
what
the
doctor
says
if
there
is
no
picture
and
she
has
heard
nothing
i
suppose
then
your
premises
are
gone
and
the
conclusion
falls
to
the
ground
what
does
it
matter
about
premises
cried
the
vicar
wife
here
is
something
dreadful
that
has
happened
oh
what
nonsense
that
is
about
imagination
children
have
no
imagination
a
dreadful
thing
has
happened
in
heaven
name
francis
tell
this
poor
child
what
she
is
to
do
my
dear
said
the
vicar
again
you
are
asking
me
to
believe
in
purgatory
nothing
less
you
are
asking
me
to
contradict
the
teaching
mary
you
must
compose
yourself
you
must
wait
till
this
excitement
has
passed
away
i
can
see
by
her
eyes
that
she
did
not
sleep
last
night
the
doctor
said
relieved
we
shall
have
her
seeing
visions
too
if
we
do
take
care
and
my
dear
mary
said
the
vicar
if
you
will
think
of
it
it
is
derogatory
to
the
dignity
of
of
our
dear
friends
who
have
passed
away
how
can
we
suppose
that
one
of
the
blessed
would
come
down
from
heaven
and
walk
about
her
own
house
which
she
had
just
left
and
show
herself
to
a
to
a
little
child
who
had
never
seen
her
before
impossible
said
the
doctor
i
told
you
so
a
stranger
that
had
no
connection
with
her
knew
nothing
about
her
instead
of
said
the
vicar
with
a
slight
tremor
making
herself
known
if
that
was
permitted
to
to
me
for
example
or
our
friend
here
that
sounds
reasonable
mary
said
bowyer
do
you
think
so
my
dear
if
she
had
come
to
one
of
us
or
to
yourself
my
darling
i
should
never
have
wondered
after
all
that
has
happened
but
to
this
little
child
whereas
there
is
nothing
more
likely
more
consonant
with
all
the
teachings
of
science
than
that
the
little
thing
should
have
this
hallucination
of
which
you
ought
never
to
have
heard
a
word
you
are
the
very
last
person
that
is
true
said
the
vicar
and
all
the
associations
of
the
place
must
be
overwhelming
my
dear
we
must
take
her
away
with
us
turner
i
am
sure
is
very
kind
but
it
can
not
be
good
for
mary
to
be
here
no
no
i
never
thought
so
said
bowyer
i
never
intended
dear
turner
we
all
appreciate
your
motives
i
hope
you
will
let
us
see
much
of
you
and
that
we
may
become
very
good
friends
but
mary
it
is
her
first
grief
do
you
know
said
the
vicar
wife
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
she
has
always
been
so
much
cared
for
so
much
thought
of
all
her
life
and
then
all
at
once
you
will
not
think
that
we
misunderstand
your
kind
motives
but
it
is
more
than
she
can
bear
she
made
up
her
mind
in
a
hurry
without
thinking
you
must
not
be
annoyed
if
we
take
her
away
turner
had
been
looking
from
one
to
another
while
this
dialogue
went
on
she
said
now
a
little
wounded
i
wished
only
to
do
what
was
kind
but
perhaps
i
was
thinking
most
of
my
own
child
miss
vivian
must
do
what
she
thinks
best
you
are
all
kind
too
kind
mary
cried
but
no
one
must
say
another
word
please
unless
turner
should
send
me
away
until
i
know
what
this
all
means
it
is
my
place
to
stay
here
ix
it
was
lady
mary
who
had
come
into
the
vicarage
that
afternoon
when
bowyer
supposed
some
one
had
called
she
wandered
about
to
a
great
many
places
in
these
days
but
always
returned
to
the
scenes
in
which
her
life
had
been
passed
and
where
alone
her
work
could
be
done
if
it
could
be
done
at
all
she
came
in
and
listened
while
the
tale
of
her
own
carelessness
and
heedlessness
was
told
and
stood
by
while
her
favorite
was
taken
to
another
woman
bosom
for
comfort
and
heard
everything
and
saw
everything
she
was
used
to
it
by
this
time
but
to
be
nothing
is
hard
even
when
you
are
accustomed
to
it
and
though
she
knew
that
they
would
not
hear
her
what
could
she
do
but
cry
out
to
them
as
she
stood
there
unregarded
oh
have
pity
upon
me
lady
mary
said
and
the
pang
in
her
heart
was
so
great
that
the
very
atmosphere
was
stirred
and
the
air
could
scarcely
contain
her
and
the
passion
of
her
endeavor
to
make
herself
known
but
thrilled
like
a
to
her
cry
bowyer
heard
the
jar
and
tingle
in
the
inanimate
world
but
she
thought
only
that
it
was
some
charitable
visitor
who
had
come
in
and
gone
softly
away
again
at
the
sound
of
tears
and
if
lady
mary
could
not
make
herself
known
to
the
poor
cottagers
who
had
loved
her
or
to
the
women
who
wept
for
her
loss
while
they
blamed
her
how
was
she
to
reveal
herself
and
her
secret
to
the
men
who
if
they
had
seen
her
would
have
thought
her
an
hallucination
yes
she
tried
all
and
even
went
a
long
journey
over
land
and
sea
to
visit
the
earl
who
was
her
heir
and
awake
in
him
an
interest
in
her
child
and
she
lingered
about
all
these
people
in
the
silence
of
the
night
and
tried
to
move
them
in
dreams
since
she
could
not
move
them
waking
it
is
more
easy
for
one
who
is
no
more
of
this
world
to
be
seen
and
heard
in
sleep
for
then
those
who
are
still
in
the
flesh
stand
on
the
borders
of
the
unseen
and
see
and
hear
things
which
waking
they
do
not
understand
but
alas
when
they
woke
this
poor
wanderer
discovered
that
her
friends
remembered
no
more
what
she
had
said
to
them
in
their
dreams
presently
however
when
she
found
mary
established
in
her
old
home
in
her
old
room
there
came
to
her
a
new
hope
for
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
so
hard
to
believe
or
to
be
convinced
of
as
that
no
effort
no
device
will
ever
make
you
known
and
visible
to
those
you
love
lady
mary
being
little
altered
in
her
character
though
so
much
in
her
being
still
believed
that
if
she
could
but
find
the
way
in
a
moment
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
all
would
be
revealed
and
understood
she
went
to
mary
room
with
this
new
hope
strong
in
her
heart
when
they
were
alone
together
in
that
nest
of
comfort
which
she
had
herself
made
beautiful
for
her
child
two
hearts
so
full
of
thought
for
each
other
what
was
there
in
earthly
bonds
which
could
prevent
them
from
meeting
she
went
into
the
silent
room
which
was
so
familiar
and
dear
and
waited
like
a
mother
long
separated
from
her
child
with
a
faint
doubt
trembling
on
the
surface
of
her
mind
yet
a
quaint
joyful
confidence
underneath
in
the
force
of
nature
a
few
words
would
be
enough
a
moment
and
all
would
be
right
and
then
she
pleased
herself
with
fancies
of
how
when
that
was
done
she
would
whisper
to
her
darling
what
has
never
been
told
to
flesh
and
blood
and
so
go
home
proud
and
satisfied
and
happy
in
the
accomplishment
of
all
she
had
hoped
mary
came
in
with
her
candle
in
her
hand
and
closed
the
door
between
her
and
all
external
things
she
looked
round
wistful
with
that
strange
consciousness
which
she
had
already
experienced
that
some
one
was
there
the
other
stood
so
close
to
her
that
the
girl
could
not
move
without
touching
her
she
held
up
her
hands
imploring
to
the
child
of
her
love
she
called
to
her
mary
mary
putting
her
hands
upon
her
and
gazed
into
her
face
with
an
intensity
and
anguish
of
eagerness
which
might
have
drawn
the
stars
out
of
the
sky
and
a
strange
tumult
was
in
mary
bosom
she
stood
looking
blankly
round
her
like
one
who
is
blind
with
open
eyes
and
saw
nothing
and
strained
her
ears
like
a
deaf
man
but
heard
nothing
all
was
silence
vacancy
an
empty
world
about
her
she
sat
down
at
her
little
table
with
a
heavy
sigh
the
child
can
see
her
but
she
will
not
come
to
me
mary
said
and
wept
then
lady
mary
turned
away
with
a
heart
full
of
despair
she
went
quickly
from
the
house
out
into
the
night
the
pang
of
her
disappointment
was
so
keen
that
she
could
not
endure
it
she
remembered
what
had
been
said
to
her
in
the
place
from
whence
she
came
and
how
she
had
been
entreated
to
be
patient
and
wait
oh
had
she
but
waited
and
been
patient
she
sat
down
upon
the
ground
a
soul
forlorn
outside
of
life
outside
of
all
things
lost
in
a
world
which
had
no
place
for
her
the
moon
shone
but
she
made
no
shadow
in
it
the
rain
fell
upon
her
but
did
not
hurt
her
the
little
night
breeze
blew
without
finding
any
resistance
in
her
she
said
to
herself
i
have
failed
what
am
i
that
i
should
do
what
they
all
said
was
impossible
it
was
my
pride
because
i
have
had
my
own
way
all
my
life
but
now
i
have
no
way
and
no
place
on
earth
and
what
i
have
to
tell
them
will
never
never
be
known
oh
my
little
mary
a
servant
in
her
own
house
and
a
word
would
make
it
right
but
never
never
can
she
hear
that
word
i
am
wrong
to
say
never
she
will
know
when
she
is
in
heaven
she
will
not
live
to
be
old
and
foolish
like
me
she
will
go
up
there
early
and
then
she
will
know
but
i
what
will
become
of
me
for
i
am
nothing
here
i
can
not
go
back
to
my
own
place
a
little
moaning
wind
rose
up
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
the
dark
night
and
carried
a
faint
wail
like
the
voice
of
some
one
lost
to
the
windows
of
the
great
house
it
woke
the
children
and
mary
who
opened
her
eyes
quickly
in
the
dark
wondering
if
perhaps
now
the
vision
might
come
to
her
but
the
vision
had
come
when
she
could
not
see
it
and
now
returned
no
more
x
on
the
other
side
however
visions
which
had
nothing
sacred
in
them
began
to
be
heard
of
and
connie
ghost
as
it
was
called
in
the
house
had
various
vulgar
effects
a
housemaid
became
hysterical
and
announced
that
she
too
had
seen
the
lady
of
whom
she
gave
a
description
exaggerated
from
connie
which
all
the
household
were
ready
to
swear
she
had
never
heard
the
lady
whom
connie
had
only
seen
passing
went
to
betsey
room
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
told
her
in
a
hollow
and
terrible
voice
that
she
could
not
rest
opening
a
series
of
communications
by
which
it
was
evident
all
the
secrets
of
the
unseen
world
would
soon
be
disclosed
and
following
upon
this
there
came
a
sort
of
panic
in
the
house
noises
were
heard
in
various
places
sounds
of
footsteps
pacing
and
of
a
long
robe
sweeping
about
the
passages
and
lady
mary
costumes
and
the
which
was
so
peculiar
which
all
her
friends
had
recognized
in
connie
description
grew
into
something
portentous
under
the
heavier
hand
of
the
and
the
prentiss
who
had
remained
as
a
special
favor
to
the
new
people
was
deeply
indignant
and
outraged
by
this
treatment
of
her
mistress
she
appealed
to
mary
with
mingled
anger
and
tears
i
would
have
sent
the
hussy
away
at
an
hour
notice
if
i
had
the
power
in
my
hands
she
cried
but
miss
mary
it
easily
seen
who
is
a
real
lady
and
who
is
not
turner
interferes
herself
in
everything
though
she
likes
it
to
be
supposed
that
she
has
a
housekeeper
dear
prentiss
you
must
not
say
turner
is
not
a
lady
she
has
far
more
delicacy
of
feeling
than
many
ladies
cried
mary
yes
miss
mary
dear
i
allow
that
she
is
very
nice
to
you
but
who
could
help
that
and
to
hear
my
lady
name
that
might
have
her
faults
but
who
was
far
above
anything
of
the
sort
in
every
mouth
and
her
costume
that
they
do
know
how
to
describe
and
to
think
that
would
go
and
talk
to
the
like
of
betsy
barnes
about
what
is
on
her
mind
i
think
sometimes
i
shall
break
my
heart
or
else
throw
up
my
place
miss
mary
prentiss
said
with
tears
oh
do
do
that
oh
do
leave
me
prentiss
mary
said
with
an
involuntary
cry
of
dismay
not
if
you
mind
not
if
you
mind
dear
the
housekeeper
cried
and
then
she
drew
close
to
the
young
lady
with
an
anxious
look
you
have
seen
anything
she
said
that
would
be
only
natural
miss
mary
i
could
well
understand
she
could
rest
in
her
grave
if
she
came
and
told
it
all
to
you
prentiss
be
silent
cried
mary
that
ends
everything
between
you
and
me
if
you
say
such
a
word
there
has
been
too
much
said
already
oh
far
too
much
as
if
i
only
loved
her
for
what
she
was
to
leave
me
i
did
not
mean
that
dear
said
prentiss
but
there
is
no
but
and
everything
she
did
was
right
the
girl
cried
with
vehemence
she
shed
hot
and
bitter
tears
over
this
wrong
which
all
her
friends
did
to
lady
mary
memory
i
am
glad
it
was
so
she
said
to
herself
when
she
was
alone
with
youthful
extravagance
i
am
glad
it
was
so
for
now
no
one
can
think
that
i
loved
her
for
anything
but
herself
the
household
however
was
agitated
by
all
these
rumors
and

connie
elder
sister
declined
to
sleep
any
longer
in
that
which
began
to
be
called
the
haunted
room
she
too
began
to
think
she
saw
something
she
could
not
tell
what
gliding
out
of
the
room
as
it
began
to
get
dark
and
to
hear
sighs
and
moans
in
the
corridors
the
servants
who
all
wanted
to
leave
and
the
villagers
who
avoided
the
grounds
after
nightfall
spread
the
rumor
far
and
near
that
the
house
was
haunted
xi
in
the
meantime
connie
herself
was
silent
and
saw
no
more
of
the
lady
her
attachment
to
mary
grew
into
one
of
those
visionary
passions
which
little
girls
so
often
form
for
young
women
she
followed
her
governess
wherever
she
went
hanging
upon
her
arm
when
she
could
holding
her
dress
when
no
other
hold
was
possible
following
her
everywhere
like
her
shadow
the
vicarage
jealous
and
annoyed
at
first
and
all
the
neighbors
indignant
too
to
see
mary
transformed
into
a
dependent
of
the
city
family
held
out
as
long
as
possible
against
the
of
turner
and
were
revolted
by
the
spectacle
of
this
child
claiming
poor
mary
attention
wherever
she
moved
but
all
these
strong
sentiments
softened
as
was
natural
the
only
real
drawback
was
that
amid
all
these
agitations
mary
lost
her
bloom
she
began
to
droop
and
grow
pale
under
the
observation
of
the
watchful
doctor
who
had
never
been
otherwise
than
dissatisfied
with
the
new
position
of
affairs
and
betook
himself
to
bowyer
for
sympathy
and
information
did
you
ever
see
a
girl
so
fallen
off
he
said
fallen
off
doctor
i
think
she
is
prettier
and
prettier
every
day
oh
the
poor
man
cried
with
a
strong
breathing
of
impatience
you
ladies
think
of
nothing
but
prettiness
was
i
talking
of
prettiness
she
must
have
lost
a
stone
since
she
went
back
there
it
is
all
very
well
to
laugh
the
doctor
added
growing
red
with
suppressed
anger
but
i
can
tell
you
that
is
the
true
test
that
little
connie
turner
is
as
well
as
possible
she
has
handed
over
her
nerves
to
mary
vivian
i
wonder
now
if
she
ever
talks
to
you
on
that
subject
who
little
connie
of
course
i
mean
miss
vivian
bowyer
do
you
know
the
village
is
all
in
a
tremble
about
the
ghost
at
the
great
house
oh
yes
i
know
and
it
is
very
strange
i
ca
help
thinking
doctor
we
had
better
not
discuss
that
subject
of
course
i
do
put
a
faith
in
any
such
nonsense
but
girls
are
full
of
fancies
i
want
you
to
find
out
for
me
whether
she
has
begun
to
think
she
sees
anything
she
looks
like
it
and
if
something
is
done
she
will
soon
do
so
if
not
now
then
you
do
think
there
is
something
to
see
said
bowyer
clasping
her
hands
that
has
always
been
my
opinion
what
so
natural
as
that
lady
mary
the
greatest
old
aristocrat
in
the
world
should
come
and
make
private
revelations
to
betsey
barnes
the
under
housemaid
said
the
doctor
with
a
sardonic
grin
i
do
mean
that
doctor
but
if
she
could
not
rest
in
her
grave
poor
old
lady
you
think
then
my
dear
said
the
vicar
that
lady
mary
an
old
friend
who
was
as
young
in
her
mind
as
any
of
us
lies
body
and
soul
in
that
old
dark
hole
of
a
vault
how
you
talk
francis
what
can
a
woman
say
between
you
horrid
men
i
say
if
she
could
rest
wherever
she
is
because
of
leaving
mary
destitute
it
would
be
only
natural
and
i
should
think
the
more
of
her
for
it
bowyer
cried
the
vicar
had
a
gentle
professional
laugh
over
the
confusion
of
his
wife
mind
but
the
doctor
took
the
matter
more
seriously
lady
mary
is
safely
buried
and
done
with
i
am
not
thinking
of
her
he
said
but
i
am
thinking
of
mary
vivian
senses
which
will
not
stand
this
much
longer
try
and
find
out
from
her
if
she
sees
anything
if
she
has
come
to
that
whatever
she
says
we
must
have
her
out
of
there
but
bowyer
had
nothing
to
report
when
this
conclave
of
friends
met
again
mary
would
not
allow
that
she
had
seen
anything
she
grew
paler
every
day
her
eyes
grew
larger
but
she
made
no
confession
and
connie
bloomed
and
grew
and
met
no
more
old
ladies
upon
the
stairs
xii
the
days
passed
on
and
no
new
event
occurred
in
this
little
history
it
came
to
be
summer
balmy
and
green
and
everything
around
the
old
house
was
delightful
and
its
beautiful
rooms
became
more
pleasant
than
ever
in
the
long
days
and
soft
brief
nights
fears
of
the
earl
return
and
of
the
possible
end
of
the
turners
tenancy
began
to
disturb
the
household
but
no
one
so
much
as
mary
who
felt
herself
to
cling
as
she
had
never
done
before
to
the
old
house
she
had
never
got
over
the
impression
that
a
secret
presence
revealed
to
no
one
else
was
continually
near
her
though
she
saw
no
one
and
her
health
was
greatly
affected
by
this
visionary
double
life
this
was
the
state
of
affairs
on
a
certain
soft
wet
day
when
the
family
were
all
within
doors
connie
had
exhausted
all
her
means
of
amusement
in
the
morning
when
the
afternoon
came
with
its
long
dull
uneventful
hours
she
had
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
fling
herself
upon
miss
vivian
upon
whom
she
had
a
special
claim
she
came
to
mary
room
disturbing
the
strange
quietude
of
that
place
and
amused
herself
looking
over
all
the
trinkets
and
ornaments
that
were
to
be
found
there
all
of
which
were
associated
to
mary
with
her
godmother
connie
tried
on
the
bracelets
and
brooches
which
mary
in
her
deep
mourning
had
not
worn
and
asked
a
hundred
questions
the
answer
which
had
to
be
so
often
repeated
that
was
given
to
me
by
my
godmother
at
last
called
forth
the
remark
how
fond
your
godmother
must
have
been
of
you
miss
vivian
she
seems
to
have
given
you
everything
everything
cried
mary
with
a
full
heart
and
yet
they
all
say
she
was
not
kind
enough
said
little
connie
what
do
they
mean
by
that
for
you
seem
to
love
her
very
much
still
though
she
is
dead
can
one
go
on
loving
people
when
they
are
dead
oh
yes
and
better
than
ever
said
mary
for
often
you
do
not
know
how
you
loved
them
or
what
they
were
to
you
till
they
are
gone
away
connie
gave
her
governess
a
hug
and
said
why
did
not
she
leave
you
all
her
money
miss
vivian
everybody
says
she
was
wicked
and
unkind
to
die
without
my
dear
cried
mary
do
not
repeat
what
ignorant
people
say
because
it
is
not
true
but
mamma
said
it
miss
vivian
she
does
not
know
connie
you
must
not
say
it
i
will
tell
your
mamma
she
must
not
say
it
for
nobody
can
know
so
well
as
i
do
and
it
is
not
true
but
they
say
cried
connie
that
that
is
why
she
ca
rest
in
her
grave
you
must
have
heard
poor
old
lady
they
say
she
can
not
rest
in
her
grave
because
mary
seized
the
child
in
her
arms
with
a
pressure
that
hurt
connie
you
must
not
you
must
not
she
cried
in
a
sort
of
panic
was
she
afraid
that
some
one
might
hear
she
gave
connie
a
hurried
kiss
and
turned
her
face
away
looking
out
into
the
vacant
room
it
is
not
true
it
is
not
true
she
cried
with
a
great
excitement
and
horror
as
if
to
stay
a
wound
she
was
always
good
and
like
an
angel
to
me
she
is
with
the
angels
she
is
with
god
she
can
not
be
disturbed
by
anything
anything
oh
let
us
never
say
or
think
or
imagine
mary
cried
her
cheeks
burned
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
it
seemed
to
her
that
something
of
wonder
and
anguish
and
dismay
was
in
the
room
round
her
as
if
some
one
unseen
had
heard
a
bitter
reproach
an
accusation
undeserved
which
must
wound
to
the
very
heart
connie
struggled
a
little
in
that
too
tight
hold
are
you
frightened
miss
vivian
what
are
you
frightened
for
no
one
can
hear
and
if
you
mind
it
so
much
i
will
never
say
it
again
you
must
never
never
say
it
again
there
is
nothing
i
mind
so
much
mary
said
oh
said
connie
with
mild
surprise
then
as
mary
hold
relaxed
she
put
her
arms
round
her
beloved
companion
neck
i
will
tell
them
all
you
do
like
it
i
will
tell
them
they
must
not
oh
cried
connie
again
in
a
quick
astonished
voice
she
clutched
mary
round
the
neck
returning
the
violence
of
the
grasp
which
had
hurt
her
and
with
the
other
hand
pointed
to
the
door
the
lady
the
lady
oh
come
and
see
where
she
is
going
connie
cried
mary
felt
as
if
the
child
in
her
vehemence
lifted
her
from
her
seat
she
had
no
sense
that
her
own
limbs
or
her
own
will
carried
her
in
the
impetuous
rush
with
which
connie
flew
the
blood
mounted
to
her
head
she
felt
a
heat
and
throbbing
as
if
her
spine
were
on
fire
connie
holding
by
her
skirts
pushing
her
on
went
along
the
corridor
to
the
other
door
now
deserted
of
lady
mary
room
there
there
do
you
see
her
she
is
going
in
the
child
cried
and
rushed
on
clinging
to
mary
dragging
her
on
her
light
hair
streaming
her
little
white
dress
waving
lady
mary
room
was
unoccupied
and
cold
cold
though
it
was
summer
with
the
chill
that
rests
in
uninhabited
apartments
the
blinds
were
drawn
down
over
the
windows
a
sort
of
blank
whiteness
greyness
was
in
the
place
which
no
one
ever
entered
the
child
rushed
on
with
eager
gestures
crying
look
look
turning
her
lively
head
from
side
to
side
mary
in
a
still
and
passive
expectation
seeing
nothing
looking
mechanically
to
where
connie
told
her
to
look
moving
like
a
creature
in
a
dream
against
her
will
followed
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
the
blank
the
vacancy
went
to
her
heart
she
no
longer
thought
of
connie
or
her
vision
she
felt
the
emptiness
with
a
desolation
such
as
she
had
never
felt
before
she
loosed
her
arm
with
something
like
impatience
from
the
child
close
clasp
for
months
she
had
not
entered
the
room
which
was
associated
with
so
much
of
her
life
connie
and
her
cries
and
warnings
passed
from
her
mind
like
the
stir
of
a
bird
or
a
fly
mary
felt
herself
alone
with
her
dead
alone
with
her
life
with
all
that
had
been
and
that
never
could
be
again
slowly
without
knowing
what
she
did
she
sank
upon
her
knees
she
raised
her
face
in
the
blank
of
desolation
about
her
to
the
unseen
heaven
unseen
unseen
whatever
we
may
do
god
above
us
and
those
who
have
gone
from
us
and
he
who
has
taken
them
who
has
redeemed
them
who
is
ours
and
theirs
our
only
hope
but
all
unseen
unseen
concealed
as
much
by
the
blue
skies
as
by
the
dull
blank
of
that
roof
her
heart
ached
and
cried
into
the
unknown
o
god
she
cried
i
do
not
know
where
she
is
but
thou
art
everywhere
o
god
let
her
know
that
i
have
never
blamed
her
never
wished
it
otherwise
never
ceased
to
love
her
and
thank
her
and
bless
her
god
god
cried
mary
with
a
great
and
urgent
cry
as
if
it
were
a
man
name
she
knelt
there
for
a
moment
before
her
senses
failed
her
her
eyes
shining
as
if
they
would
burst
from
their
sockets
her
lips
dropping
apart
her
countenance
like
marble
xiii
and
was
standing
there
all
the
time
said
connie
crying
and
telling
her
little
tale
after
mary
had
been
carried
away
standing
with
her
hand
upon
that
cabinet
looking
and
looking
oh
as
if
she
wanted
to
say
something
and
could
why
could
she
mamma
oh
bowyer
why
could
she
if
she
wanted
so
much
why
would
god
let
her
speak
xiv
mary
had
a
long
illness
and
hovered
on
the
verge
of
death
she
said
a
great
deal
in
her
wanderings
about
some
one
who
had
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
a
moment
she
would
cry
only
a
moment
and
i
had
so
much
to
say
but
as
she
got
better
nothing
was
said
to
her
about
this
face
she
had
seen
and
perhaps
it
was
only
the
suggestion
of
some
feverish
dream
she
was
taken
away
and
was
a
long
time
getting
up
her
strength
and
in
the
meantime
the
turners
insisted
that
the
chains
should
be
thoroughly
seen
to
which
were
not
all
in
a
perfect
state
and
the
earl
coming
to
see
the
place
took
a
fancy
to
it
and
determined
to
keep
it
in
his
own
hands
he
was
a
friendly
person
and
his
ideas
of
decoration
were
quite
different
from
those
of
his
grandmother
he
gave
away
a
great
deal
of
her
old
furniture
and
sold
the
rest
among
the
articles
given
away
was
the
italian
cabinet
which
the
vicar
had
always
had
a
fancy
for
and
naturally
it
had
not
been
in
the
vicarage
a
day
before
the
boys
insisted
on
finding
out
the
way
of
opening
the
secret
drawer
and
there
the
paper
was
found
in
the
most
natural
way
without
any
trouble
or
mystery
at
all
xv
they
all
gathered
to
see
the
wanderer
coming
back
she
was
not
as
she
had
been
when
she
went
away
her
face
which
had
been
so
easy
was
worn
with
trouble
her
eyes
were
deep
with
things
unspeakable
pity
and
knowledge
were
in
the
lines
which
time
had
not
made
it
was
a
great
event
in
that
place
to
see
one
come
back
who
did
not
come
by
the
common
way
she
was
received
by
the
great
officer
who
had
given
her
permission
to
go
and
her
companions
who
had
received
her
at
the
first
all
came
forward
wondering
to
hear
what
she
had
to
say
because
it
only
occurs
to
those
wanderers
who
have
gone
back
to
earth
of
their
own
will
to
return
when
they
have
accomplished
what
they
wished
or
it
is
judged
above
that
there
is
nothing
possible
more
accordingly
the
question
was
on
all
their
lips
you
have
set
the
wrong
right
you
have
done
what
you
desired
oh
she
said
stretching
out
her
hands
how
well
one
is
in
one
own
place
how
blessed
to
be
at
home
i
have
seen
the
trouble
and
sorrow
in
the
earth
till
my
heart
is
sore
and
sometimes
i
have
been
near
to
die
but
that
is
impossible
said
the
man
who
had
loved
her
if
it
had
not
been
impossible
i
should
have
died
she
said
i
have
stood
among
people
who
loved
me
and
they
have
not
seen
me
nor
known
me
nor
heard
my
cry
i
have
been
outcast
from
all
life
for
i
belonged
to
none
i
have
longed
for
you
all
and
my
heart
has
failed
me
oh
how
lonely
it
is
in
the
world
when
you
are
a
wanderer
and
can
be
known
of
none
you
were
warned
said
he
who
was
in
authority
that
it
was
more
bitter
than
death
what
is
death
she
said
and
no
one
made
any
reply
neither
did
any
one
venture
to
ask
her
again
whether
she
had
been
successful
in
her
mission
but
at
last
when
the
warmth
of
her
appointed
home
had
melted
the
ice
about
her
heart
she
smiled
once
more
and
spoke
the
little
children
knew
me
they
were
not
afraid
of
me
they
held
out
their
arms
and
god
dear
and
innocent
creatures
she
wept
a
few
tears
which
were
sweet
after
the
ice
tears
she
had
shed
upon
the
earth
and
then
some
one
more
bold
than
the
rest
asked
again
and
did
you
accomplish
what
you
wished
she
had
come
to
herself
by
this
time
and
the
dark
lines
were
melting
from
her
face
i
am
forgiven
she
said
with
a
low
cry
of
happiness
she
whom
i
wronged
loves
me
and
blessed
me
and
we
saw
each
other
face
to
face
i
know
nothing
more
there
is
no
more
said
all
together
for
everything
is
included
in
pardon
and
love
