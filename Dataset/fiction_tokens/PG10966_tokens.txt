the

the
first

on
the
this
the
third
completes
what
perhaps
may
be
termed
a
trilogy
for
though
very
different
in
scope
each
of
the
three
books
deals
with
certain
conceptions
that
have
an
elemental
kinship
with
this
book
the
author
believes
that
he
closes
the
door
so
far
as
he
is
concerned

and
away
we
blow
i
figure
out
of
the
he
began
without
any
circumlocution
i
joined
the
in
i
heard
before
i
signed
on
that
there
were
some
funny
yarns
floating
round
about
her
but
i
was
pretty
nearly
on
the
beach
and
too
jolly
anxious
to
get
away
to
worry
about
trifles
besides
by
all
accounts
she
was
right
enough
so
far
as
grub
and
treatment
went
when
i
asked
fellows
to
give
it
a
name
they
generally
could
not
all
they
could
tell
me
was
that
she
was
unlucky
and
made
thundering
long
passages
and
had
no
more
than
a
fair
share
of
dirty
weather
also
that
she
had
twice
had
the
sticks
blown
out
of
her
and
her
cargo
shifted
besides
all
these
a
heap
of
other
things
that
might
happen
to
any
packet
and
would
not
be
comfortable
to
run
into
still
they
were
the
ordinary
things
and
i
was
willing
enough
to
risk
them
to
get
home
all
the
same
if
i
had
been
given
the
chance
i
should
have
shipped
in
some
other
vessel
as
a
matter
of
preference
when
i
took
my
bag
down
i
found
that
they
had
signed
on
the
rest
of
the
crowd
you
see
the
home
lot
cleared
out
when
they
got
into
that
is
all
except
one
young
fellow
a
cockney
who
had
stuck
by
the
ship
in
port
he
told
me
afterwards
when
i
got
to
know
him
that
he
intended
to
draw
a
out
of
her
whether
any
one
else
did
or
not
the
first
night
i
was
in
her
i
found
that
it
was
common
talk
among
the
other
fellows
that
there
was
something
queer
about
the
ship
they
spoke
of
her
as
if
it
were
an
accepted
fact
that
she
was
haunted
yet
they
all
treated
the
matter
as
a
joke
all
that
is
except
the
young
cockney
williams
who
instead
of
laughing
at
their
jests
on
the
subject
seemed
to
take
the
whole
matter
seriously
this
made
me
rather
curious
i
began
to
wonder
whether
there
was
after
all
some
truth
underlying
the
vague
stories
i
had
heard
and
i
took
the
first
opportunity
to
ask
him
whether
he
had
any
reasons
for
believing
that
there
was
anything
in
the
yarns
about
the
ship
at
first
he
was
inclined
to
be
a
bit
offish
but
presently
he
came
round
and
told
me
that
he
did
not
know
of
any
particular
incident
which
could
be
called
unusual
in
the
sense
in
which
i
meant
yet
that
at
the
same
time
there
were
lots
of
little
things
which
if
you
put
them
together
made
you
think
a
bit
for
instance
she
always
made
such
long
passages
and
had
so
much
dirty
weather
nothing
but
that
and
calms
and
head
winds
then
other
things
happened
sails
that
he
knew
himself
had
been
properly
stowed
were
always
blowing
adrift
and
then
he
said
a
thing
that
surprised
me
there
too
many
bloomin
shadders
about
this
packet
they
gets
onter
yer
nerves
like
nothin
as
ever
i
seen
before
in
me
he
blurted
it
all
out
in
a
heap
and
i
turned
round
and
looked
at
him
too
many
shadows
i
said
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
but
he
refused
to
explain
himself
or
tell
me
anything
further
just
shook
his
head
stupidly
when
i
questioned
him
he
seemed
to
have
taken
a
sudden
sulky
fit
i
felt
certain
that
he
was
acting
dense
purposely
i
believe
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
he
was
in
a
way
ashamed
of
having
let
himself
go
like
he
had
in
speaking
out
his
thoughts
about
shadders
that
type
of
man
may
think
things
at
times
but
he
does
often
put
them
into
words
anyhow
i
saw
it
was
no
use
asking
any
further
questions
so
i
let
the
matter
drop
there
yet
for
several
days
afterwards
i
caught
myself
wondering
at
times
what
the
fellow
had
meant
by
shadders
we
left
next
day
with
a
fine
fair
wind
that
seemed
a
bit
like
putting
the
stopper
on
the
yarns
i
had
heard
about
the
ship
ill
luck
and
yet
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
went
on
again
for
the
first
couple
of
weeks
out
nothing
unusual
happened
and
the
wind
still
held
fair
i
began
to
feel
that
i
had
been
rather
lucky
after
all
in
the
packet
into
which
i
had
been
shunted
most
of
the
other
fellows
gave
her
a
good
name
and
there
was
a
pretty
general
opinion
growing
among
the
crowd
that
it
was
all
a
silly
yarn
about
her
being
haunted
and
then
just
when
i
was
settling
down
to
things
something
happened
that
opened
my
eyes
no
end
it
was
in
the
eight
to
twelve
watch
and
i
was
sitting
on
the
steps
on
the
starboard
side
leading
up
to
the
head
the
night
was
fine
and
there
was
a
splendid
moon
away
aft
i
heard
the
timekeeper
strike
four
bells
and
the
an
old
fellow
named
jaskett
answered
him
as
he
let
go
the
bell
lanyard
he
caught
sight
of
me
where
i
sat
quietly
smoking
he
leant
over
the
rail
and
looked
down
at
me
that
you
jessop
he
asked
i
believe
it
is
i
replied
we
our
an
all
the
rest
of
our
petticoated
comin
to
sea
if
always
like
this
he
remarked
reflectively
indicating
with
a
sweep
of
his
pipe
and
hand
the
calmness
of
the
sea
and
sky
i
saw
no
reason
for
denying
that
and
he
continued
if
this
ole
packet
is
as
some
on
seems
to
think
well
all
as
i
can
say
is
let
me
the
luck
to
tumble
across
another
of
the
same
sort
good
grub
an
duff
fer
sundays
an
a
decent
crowd
of
aft
an
everythin
comfertable
like
so
as
yer
can
feel
yer
knows
where
yer
are
as
fer
bein
that
all
nonsense
comed
lots
of
before
as
was
said
to
be
an
so
some
on
was
but
was
with
ghostesses
one
packet
i
was
in
they
was
that
bad
yer
could
sleep
a
wink
in
yer
watch
below
until
yer
every
stitch
out
yer
bunk
an
a
sometimes
at
that
moment
the
relief
one
of
the
ordinary
seamen
went
up
the
other
ladder
on
to
the
head
and
the
old
chap
turned
to
ask
him
why
the
he
not
relieved
him
a
bit
smarter
the
ordinary
made
some
reply
but
what
it
was
i
did
not
catch
for
abruptly
away
aft
my
rather
sleepy
gaze
had
lighted
on
something
altogether
extraordinary
and
outrageous
it
was
nothing
less
than
the
form
of
a
man
stepping
inboard
over
the
starboard
rail
a
little
abaft
the
main
rigging
i
stood
up
and
caught
at
the
handrail
and
stared
behind
me
someone
spoke
it
was
the
who
had
come
down
off
the
head
on
his
way
aft
to
report
the
name
of
his
relief
to
the
second
mate
what
is
it
mate
he
asked
curiously
seeing
my
intent
attitude
the
thing
whatever
it
was
had
disappeared
into
the
shadows
on
the
lee
side
of
the
deck
nothing
i
replied
shortly
for
i
was
too
bewildered
then
at
what
my
eyes
had
just
shown
me
to
say
any
more
i
wanted
to
think
the
old
shellback
glanced
at
me
but
only
muttered
something
and
went
on
his
way
aft
for
a
minute
perhaps
i
stood
there
watching
but
could
see
nothing
then
i
walked
slowly
aft
as
far
as
the
after
end
of
the
deck
house
from
there
i
could
see
most
of
the
main
deck
but
nothing
showed
except
of
course
the
moving
shadows
of
the
ropes
and
spars
and
sails
as
they
swung
to
and
fro
in
the
moonlight
the
old
chap
who
had
just
come
off
the
had
returned
forrard
again
and
i
was
alone
on
that
part
of
the
deck
and
then
all
at
once
as
i
stood
peering
into
the
shadows
to
leeward
i
remembered
what
williams
had
said
about
there
being
too
many
shadders
i
had
been
puzzled
to
understand
his
real
meaning
then
i
had
no
difficulty
there
too
many
shadows
yet
shadows
or
no
shadows
i
realised
that
for
my
own
peace
of
mind
i
must
settle
once
and
for
all
whether
the
thing
i
had
seemed
to
see
stepping
aboard
out
of
the
ocean
had
been
a
reality
or
simply
a
phantom
as
you
might
say
of
my
imagination
my
reason
said
it
was
nothing
more
than
imagination
a
rapid
dream
i
must
have
dozed
but
something
deeper
than
reason
told
me
that
this
was
not
so
i
put
it
to
the
test
and
went
straight
in
amongst
the
shadows
there
was
nothing
i
grew
bolder
my
common
sense
told
me
i
must
have
fancied
it
all
i
walked
over
to
the
mainmast
and
looked
behind
the
pinrail
that
partly
surrounded
it
and
down
into
the
shadow
of
the
pumps
but
here
again
was
nothing
then
i
went
in
under
the
break
of
the
poop
it
was
darker
under
there
than
out
on
deck
i
looked
up
both
sides
of
the
deck
and
saw
that
they
were
bare
of
anything
such
as
i
looked
for
the
assurance
was
comforting
i
glanced
at
the
poop
ladders
and
remembered
that
nothing
could
have
gone
up
there
without
the
second
mate
or
the
seeing
it
then
i
leant
my
back
up
against
the
bulkshead
and
thought
the
whole
matter
over
rapidly
sucking
at
my
pipe
and
keeping
my
glance
about
the
deck
i
concluded
my
think
and
said
no
out
loud
then
something
occurred
to
me
and
i
said
unless
and
went
over
to
the
starboard
bulwarks
and
looked
over
and
down
into
the
sea
but
there
was
nothing
but
sea
and
so
i
turned
and
made
my
way
forrard
my
common
sense
had
triumphed
and
i
was
convinced
that
my
imagination
had
been
playing
tricks
with
me
i
reached
the
door
on
the
portside
leading
into
the
and
was
about
to
enter
when
something
made
me
look
behind
as
i
did
so
i
had
a
shaker
away
aft
a
dim
shadowy
form
stood
in
the
wake
of
a
swaying
belt
of
moonlight
that
swept
the
deck
a
bit
abaft
the
it
was
the
same
figure
that
i
had
just
been
attributing
to
my
fancy
i
will
admit
that
i
felt
more
than
startled
i
was
quite
a
bit
frightened
i
was
convinced
now
that
it
was
no
mere
imaginary
thing
it
was
a
human
figure
and
yet
with
the
flicker
of
the
moonlight
and
the
shadows
chasing
over
it
i
was
unable
to
say
more
than
that
then
as
i
stood
there
irresolute
and
funky
i
got
the
thought
that
someone
was
acting
the
goat
though
for
what
reason
or
purpose
i
never
stopped
to
consider
i
was
glad
of
any
suggestion
that
my
common
sense
assured
me
was
not
impossible
and
for
the
moment
i
felt
quite
relieved
that
side
to
the
question
had
not
presented
itself
to
me
before
i
began
to
pluck
up
courage
i
accused
myself
of
getting
fanciful
otherwise
i
should
have
tumbled
to
it
earlier
and
then
funnily
enough
in
spite
of
all
my
reasoning
i
was
still
afraid
of
going
aft
to
discover
who
that
was
standing
on
the
lee
side
of
the
maindeck
yet
i
felt
that
if
i
shirked
it
i
was
only
fit
to
be
dumped
overboard
and
so
i
went
though
not
with
any
great
speed
as
you
can
imagine
i
had
gone
half
the
distance
and
still
the
figure
remained
there
motionless
and
silent
the
moonlight
and
the
shadows
playing
over
it
with
each
roll
of
the
ship
i
think
i
tried
to
be
surprised
if
it
were
one
of
the
fellows
playing
the
fool
he
must
have
heard
me
coming
and
why
did
he
scoot
while
he
had
the
chance
and
where
could
he
have
hidden
himself
before
all
these
things
i
asked
myself
in
a
rush
with
a
queer
mixture
of
doubt
and
belief
and
you
know
in
the
meantime
i
was
drawing
nearer
i
had
passed
the
house
and
was
not
twelve
paces
distant
when
abruptly
the
silent
figure
made
three
quick
strides
to
the
port
rail
and
over
it
into
the
i
rushed
to
the
side
and
stared
over
but
nothing
met
my
gaze
except
the
shadow
of
the
ship
sweeping
over
the
moonlit
sea
how
long
i
stared
down
blankly
into
the
water
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
certainly
for
a
good
minute
i
felt
blank
just
horribly
blank
it
was
such
a
beastly
confirmation
of
the
of
the
thing
i
had
concluded
to
be
only
a
sort
of
brain
fancy
i
seemed
for
that
little
time
deprived
you
know
of
the
power
of
coherent
thought
i
suppose
i
was
dazed
mentally
stunned
in
a
way
as
i
have
said
a
minute
or
so
must
have
gone
while
i
had
been
staring
into
the
dark
of
the
water
under
the
ship
side
then
i
came
suddenly
to
my
ordinary
self
the
second
mate
was
singing
out
lee
fore
brace
i
went
to
the
braces
like
a
chap
in
a
dream
ii
what
tammy
the
saw
the
next
morning
in
my
watch
below
i
had
a
look
at
the
places
where
that
strange
thing
had
come
aboard
and
left
the
ship
but
i
found
nothing
unusual
and
no
clue
to
help
me
to
understand
the
mystery
of
the
strange
man
for
several
days
after
that
all
went
quietly
though
i
prowled
about
the
decks
at
night
trying
to
discover
anything
fresh
that
might
tend
to
throw
some
light
on
the
matter
i
was
careful
to
say
nothing
to
any
one
about
the
thing
i
had
seen
in
any
case
i
felt
sure
i
should
only
have
been
laughed
at
several
nights
passed
away
in
this
manner
and
i
was
no
nearer
to
an
understanding
of
the
affair
and
then
in
the
middle
watch
something
happened
it
was
my
wheel
tammy
one
of
the
first
voyage
was
keeping
time
walking
up
and
down
the
lee
side
of
the
poop
the
second
mate
was
forrard
leaning
over
the
break
of
the
poop
smoking
the
weather
still
continued
fine
and
the
moon
though
declining
was
sufficiently
powerful
to
make
every
detail
about
the
poop
stand
out
distinctly
three
bells
had
gone
and
i
admit
i
was
feeling
sleepy
indeed
i
believe
i
must
have
dozed
for
the
old
packet
steered
very
easily
and
there
was
precious
little
to
do
beyond
giving
her
an
odd
spoke
now
and
again
and
then
all
at
once
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
heard
someone
calling
my
name
softly
i
could
not
be
certain
and
first
i
glanced
forrard
to
where
the
second
stood
smoking
and
from
him
i
looked
into
the
binnacle
the
ship
head
was
right
on
her
course
and
i
felt
easier
then
suddenly
i
heard
it
again
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
this
time
and
i
glanced
to
leeward
there
i
saw
tammy
reaching
over
the
steering
gear
his
hand
out
in
the
act
of
trying
to
touch
my
arm
i
was
about
to
ask
him
what
the
devil
he
wanted
when
he
held
up
his
finger
for
silence
and
pointed
forrard
along
the
lee
side
of
the
poop
in
the
dim
light
his
face
showed
palely
and
he
seemed
much
agitated
for
a
few
seconds
i
stared
in
the
direction
he
indicated
but
could
see
nothing
what
is
it
i
asked
in
an
undertone
after
a
couple
of
further
ineffectual
peering
i
ca
see
anything
he
muttered
hoarsely
without
looking
in
my
direction
then
all
at
once
with
a
quick
little
gasp
he
sprang
across
the
and
stood
beside
me
trembling
his
gaze
appeared
to
follow
the
movements
of
something
i
could
not
see
i
must
say
that
i
was
startled
his
movement
had
shown
such
terror
and
the
way
he
stared
to
leeward
made
me
think
he
saw
something
uncanny
what
the
deuce
is
up
with
you
i
asked
sharply
and
then
i
remembered
the
second
mate
i
glanced
forrard
to
where
he
lounged
his
back
was
still
towards
us
and
he
had
not
seen
tammy
then
i
turned
to
the
boy
for
goodness
sake
get
to
looard
before
the
second
sees
you
i
said
if
you
want
to
say
anything
say
it
across
the
you
been
dreaming
even
as
i
spoke
the
little
beggar
caught
at
my
sleeve
with
one
hand
and
pointing
across
to
the
with
the
other
screamed
coming
he
coming
at
this
instant
the
second
mate
came
running
aft
singing
out
to
know
what
was
the
matter
then
suddenly
crouching
under
the
rail
near
the
i
saw
something
that
looked
like
a
man
but
so
hazy
and
unreal
that
i
could
scarcely
say
i
saw
anything
yet
like
a
flash
my
thoughts
ripped
back
to
the
silent
figure
i
had
seen
in
the
flicker
of
the
moonlight
a
week
earlier
the
second
mate
reached
me
and
i
pointed
dumbly
and
yet
as
i
did
so
it
was
with
the
knowledge
that
would
not
be
able
to
see
what
i
saw
queer
was
it
and
then
almost
in
a
breath
i
lost
sight
of
the
thing
and
became
aware
that
tammy
was
hugging
my
knees
the
second
continued
to
stare
at
the
for
a
brief
instant
then
he
turned
to
me
with
a
sneer
been
asleep
the
pair
of
you
i
suppose
then
without
waiting
for
my
denial
he
told
tammy
to
go
to
hell
out
of
it
and
stop
his
noise
or
he
boot
him
off
the
poop
after
that
he
walked
forward
to
the
break
of
the
poop
and
lit
his
pipe
again
walking
forward
and
aft
every
few
minutes
and
eyeing
me
at
times
i
thought
with
a
strange
look
later
as
soon
as
i
was
relieved
i
hurried
down
to
the
berth
i
was
anxious
to
speak
to
tammy
there
were
a
dozen
questions
that
worried
me
and
i
was
in
doubt
what
i
ought
to
do
i
found
him
crouched
on
a
his
knees
up
to
his
chin
and
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
doorway
with
a
frightened
stare
i
put
my
head
into
the
berth
and
he
gave
a
gasp
then
he
saw
who
it
was
and
his
face
relaxed
something
of
its
strained
expression
he
said
come
in
in
a
low
voice
which
he
tried
to
steady
and
i
stepped
over
the
and
sat
down
on
a
chest
facing
him
what
was
he
asked
putting
his
feet
down
on
to
the
deck
and
leaning
forward
for
god
sake
tell
me
what
it
was
his
voice
had
risen
and
i
put
up
my
hand
to
warn
him
i
said
you
wake
the
other
fellows
he
repeated
his
question
but
in
a
lower
tone
i
hesitated
before
answering
him
i
felt
all
at
once
that
it
might
be
better
to
deny
all
knowledge
to
say
i
had
seen
anything
unusual
i
thought
quickly
and
made
answer
on
the
turn
of
the
moment
what
was
i
said
that
just
the
thing
i
come
to
ask
you
a
pretty
pair
of
fools
you
made
of
the
two
of
us
up
on
the
poop
just
now
with
your
hysterical
tomfoolery
i
concluded
my
remark
in
a
tone
of
anger
i
did
he
answered
in
a
passionate
whisper
you
know
i
did
you
know
saw
it
yourself
you
pointed
it
out
to
the
second
mate
i
saw
you
the
little
beggar
was
nearly
crying
between
fear
and
vexation
at
my
assumed
unbelief
rot
i
replied
you
know
jolly
well
you
were
sleeping
in
your
you
dreamed
something
and
woke
up
suddenly
you
were
off
your
chump
i
was
determined
to
reassure
him
if
possible
though
goodness
i
wanted
assurance
myself
if
he
had
known
of
that
other
thing
i
had
seen
down
on
the
maindeck
what
then
i
was
asleep
any
more
than
you
were
he
said
bitterly
and
you
know
it
you
just
fooling
me
the
ship
haunted
what
i
said
sharply
she
haunted
he
said
again
she
haunted
who
says
so
i
inquired
in
a
tone
of
unbelief
i
do
and
you
it
everybody
knows
it
but
they
do
more
than
half
believe
it
i
did
until
tonight
damned
rot
i
answered
that
all
a
blooming
old
shellback
yarn
she
no
more
haunted
than
i
am
it
not
damned
rot
he
replied
totally
unconvinced
and
it
not
an
old
shellback
yarn
why
wo
you
say
you
saw
it
he
cried
growing
almost
tearfully
excited
and
raising
his
voice
again
i
warned
him
not
to
wake
the
sleepers
why
wo
you
say
that
you
saw
it
he
repeated
i
got
up
from
the
chest
and
went
towards
the
door
you
a
young
idiot
i
said
and
i
should
advise
you
not
to
go
gassing
about
like
this
round
the
decks
take
my
tip
and
and
get
a
sleep
you
talking
dotty
tomorrow
you
perhaps
feel
what
an
unholy
ass
you
made
of
yourself
i
stepped
over
the
washboard
and
left
him
i
believe
he
followed
me
to
the
door
to
say
something
further
but
i
was
forward
by
then
for
the
next
couple
of
days
i
avoided
him
as
much
as
possible
taking
care
never
to
let
him
catch
me
alone
i
was
determined
if
possible
to
convince
him
that
he
had
been
mistaken
in
supposing
that
he
had
seen
anything
that
night
yet
after
all
it
was
little
enough
use
as
you
will
soon
see
for
on
the
night
of
the
second
day
there
was
a
further
extraordinary
development
that
made
denial
on
my
part
useless
iii
the
man
up
the
main
it
occurred
in
the
first
watch
just
after
six
bells
i
was
forward
sitting
on
the
no
one
was
about
the
maindeck
the
night
was
exceedingly
fine
and
the
wind
had
dropped
away
almost
to
nothing
so
that
the
ship
was
very
quiet
suddenly
i
heard
the
second
mate
voice
in
the
there
who
that
going
aloft
i
sat
up
on
the
hatch
and
listened
there
succeeded
an
intense
silence
then
the
second
voice
came
again
he
was
evidently
getting
wild
do
you
damn
well
hear
me
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
up
there
come
down
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
walked
up
to
from
there
i
could
see
the
break
of
the
poop
the
second
mate
was
standing
by
the
starboard
ladder
he
appeared
to
be
looking
up
at
something
that
was
hidden
from
me
by
the
topsails
as
i
stared
he
broke
out
again
hell
and
damnation
you
blasted
sojer
come
down
when
i
tell
you
he
stamped
on
the
poop
and
repeated
his
order
savagely
but
there
was
no
answer
i
started
to
walk
aft
what
had
happened
who
had
gone
aloft
who
would
be
fool
enough
to
go
without
being
told
and
then
all
at
once
a
thought
came
to
me
the
figure
tammy
and
i
had
seen
had
the
second
mate
seen
something
someone
i
hurried
on
and
then
stopped
suddenly
in
the
same
moment
there
came
the
shrill
blast
of
the
whistle
he
was
whistling
for
the
watch
and
i
turned
and
ran
to
the
to
rouse
them
out
another
minute
and
i
was
hurrying
aft
with
them
to
see
what
was
wanted
his
voice
met
us
up
the
main
some
of
you
smartly
now
and
find
out
who
that
damned
fool
is
up
there
see
what
mischief
he
up
to
i
i
sir
several
of
the
men
sung
out
and
a
couple
jumped
into
the
weather
rigging
i
joined
them
and
the
rest
were
proceeding
to
follow
but
the
second
shouted
for
some
to
go
up
to
leeward
in
case
the
fellow
tried
to
get
down
that
side
as
i
followed
the
other
two
aloft
i
heard
the
second
mate
tell
tammy
whose
it
was
to
get
down
on
to
the
maindeck
with
the
other
and
keep
an
eye
on
the
fore
and
aft
stays
he
may
try
down
one
of
them
if
he
cornered
i
heard
him
explain
if
you
see
anything
just
sing
out
for
me
right
away
tammy
hesitated
well
said
the
second
mate
sharply
nothing
sir
said
tammy
and
went
down
on
to
the
maindeck
the
first
man
to
had
reached
the
futtock
shrouds
his
head
was
above
the
top
and
he
was
taking
a
preliminary
look
before
venturing
higher
see
anythin
jock
asked
plummer
the
man
next
above
me
na
said
jock
tersely
and
climbed
over
the
top
and
so
disappeared
from
my
sight
the
fellow
ahead
of
me
followed
he
reached
the
futtock
rigging
and
stopped
to
expectorate
i
was
close
at
his
heels
and
he
looked
down
to
me
what
up
anyway
he
said
what
seen
we
chasin
after
i
said
i
did
know
and
he
swung
up
into
the
topmast
rigging
i
followed
on
the
chaps
on
the
lee
side
were
about
level
with
us
under
the
foot
of
the
topsail
i
could
see
tammy
and
the
other
down
on
the
maindeck
looking
upwards
the
fellows
were
a
bit
excited
in
a
sort
of
subdued
way
though
i
am
inclined
to
think
there
was
far
more
curiosity
and
perhaps
a
certain
consciousness
of
the
strangeness
of
it
all
i
know
that
looking
to
leeward
there
was
a
tendancy
to
keep
well
together
in
which
i
sympathised
must
be
a
bloomin
stowaway
one
of
the
men
suggested
i
grabbed
at
the
idea
instantly
perhaps
and
then
in
a
moment
i
dismissed
it
i
remembered
how
that
first
thing
had
stepped
over
the
rail
the
sea
matter
could
not
be
explained
in
such
a
manner
with
regard
to
this
i
was
curious
and
anxious
i
had
seen
nothing
this
time
what
could
the
second
mate
have
seen
i
wondered
were
we
chasing
fancies
or
was
there
really
someone
something
real
among
the
shadows
above
us
my
thoughts
returned
to
that
thing
tammy
and
i
had
seen
near
the
i
remembered
how
incapable
the
second
mate
had
been
of
seeing
anything
then
i
remembered
how
natural
it
had
seemed
that
he
should
not
be
able
to
see
i
caught
the
word
stowaway
again
after
all
that
might
explain
away
affair
it
would
my
train
of
thought
was
broken
suddenly
one
of
the
men
was
shouting
and
gesticulating
i
sees
i
sees
he
was
pointing
upwards
over
our
heads
where
said
the
man
above
me
where
i
was
looking
up
for
all
that
i
was
worth
i
was
conscious
of
a
certain
sense
of
relief
it
is
then
i
said
to
myself
i
screwed
my
head
round
and
looked
along
the
yards
above
us
yet
still
i
could
see
nothing
nothing
except
shadows
and
patches
of
light
down
on
deck
i
caught
the
second
mate
voice
have
you
got
him
he
was
shouting
not
yet
zur
sung
out
the
lowest
man
on
the
lee
side
we
sees
sir
added
quoin
i
do
i
said
there
is
agen
he
said
we
had
reached
the
rigging
and
he
was
pointing
up
to
the
royal
yard
ye
a
fule
quoin
that
what
ye
are
the
voice
came
from
above
it
was
jock
and
there
was
a
burst
of
laughter
at
quoin
expense
i
could
see
jock
now
he
was
standing
in
the
rigging
just
below
the
yard
he
had
gone
straight
away
up
while
the
rest
of
us
were
mooning
over
the
top
ye
a
fule
quoin
he
said
again
and
i
thinking
the
juist
as
saft
he
began
to
descend
then
there
no
one
i
asked
na
he
said
briefly
as
we
reached
the
deck
the
second
mate
ran
down
off
the
poop
he
came
towards
us
with
an
expectant
air
you
got
him
he
asked
confidently
there
was
anyone
i
said
what
he
nearly
shouted
you
hiding
something
he
continued
angrily
and
glancing
from
one
to
another
out
with
it
who
was
it
we
hiding
nothing
i
replied
speaking
for
the
lot
there
no
one
up
there
the
second
looked
round
upon
us
am
i
a
fool
he
asked
contemptuously
there
was
an
assenting
silence
i
saw
him
myself
he
continued
tammy
here
saw
him
he
was
over
the
top
when
i
first
spotted
him
there
no
mistake
about
it
it
all
damned
rot
saying
he
not
there
well
he
not
sir
i
answered
jock
went
right
up
to
the
royal
yard
the
second
mate
said
nothing
in
immediate
reply
but
went
aft
a
few
steps
and
looked
up
the
main
then
he
turned
to
the
two
sure
you
two
boys
did
see
anyone
coming
down
from
the
main
he
inquired
suspiciously
yes
sir
they
answered
together
anyway
i
heard
him
mutter
to
himself
i
have
spotted
him
myself
if
he
had
have
you
any
idea
sir
who
it
was
you
saw
i
asked
at
this
juncture
he
looked
at
me
keenly
no
he
said
he
thought
for
a
few
moments
while
we
all
stood
about
in
silence
waiting
for
him
to
let
us
go
by
the
holy
poker
he
exclaimed
suddenly
but
i
ought
to
have
thought
of
that
before
he
turned
and
eyed
us
individually
you
all
here
he
asked
yes
sir
we
said
in
a
chorus
i
could
see
that
he
was
counting
us
then
he
spoke
again
all
of
you
men
stay
here
where
you
are
tammy
you
go
into
place
and
see
if
the
other
fellows
are
in
their
bunks
then
come
and
tell
me
smartly
now
the
boy
went
and
he
turned
to
the
other
you
get
along
forrard
to
the
he
said
count
the
other
watch
then
come
aft
and
report
to
me
as
the
youngster
disappeared
along
the
deck
to
the
tammy
returned
from
his
visit
to
the
glory
hole
to
tell
the
second
mate
that
the
other
two
were
sound
asleep
in
their
bunks
whereupon
the
second
bundled
him
off
to
the
carpenter
and
sailmaker
berth
to
see
whether
they
were
while
he
was
gone
the
other
boy
came
aft
and
reported
that
all
the
men
were
in
their
bunks
and
asleep
sure
the
second
asked
him
quite
sir
he
answered
the
second
mate
made
a
quick
gesture
go
and
see
if
the
steward
is
in
his
berth
he
said
abruptly
it
was
plain
to
me
that
he
was
tremendously
puzzled
you
something
to
learn
yet
second
mate
i
thought
to
myself
then
i
fell
to
wondering
to
what
conclusions
he
would
come
a
few
seconds
later
tammy
returned
to
say
that
the
carpenter
sailmaker
and
doctor
were
all
the
second
mate
muttered
something
and
told
him
to
go
down
into
the
saloon
to
see
whether
the
first
and
third
mates
by
any
chance
were
not
in
their
berths
tammy
started
off
then
halted
shall
i
have
a
look
into
the
old
man
place
sir
while
i
down
there
he
inquired
no
said
the
second
mate
do
what
i
told
you
and
then
come
and
tell
me
if
anyone
to
go
into
the
captain
cabin
it
got
to
be
me
tammy
said
i
i
sir
and
skipped
away
up
on
to
the
poop
while
he
was
gone
the
other
came
up
to
say
that
the
steward
was
in
his
berth
and
that
he
wanted
to
know
what
the
hell
he
was
fooling
round
his
part
of
the
ship
for
the
second
mate
said
nothing
for
nearly
a
minute
then
he
turned
to
us
and
told
us
we
might
go
forrard
as
we
moved
off
in
a
body
and
talking
in
undertones
tammy
came
down
from
the
poop
and
went
up
to
the
second
mate
i
heard
him
say
that
the
two
mates
were
in
their
berths
asleep
then
he
added
as
if
it
were
an
afterthought
so
the
old
man
i
thought
i
told
you
the
second
mate
began
i
did
sir
tammy
said
his
cabin
door
was
open
the
second
mate
started
to
go
aft
i
caught
a
fragment
of
a
remark
he
was
making
to
accounted
for
the
whole
crew
i
he
went
up
on
to
the
poop
i
did
not
catch
the
rest
i
had
loitered
a
moment
now
however
i
hurried
after
the
others
as
we
neared
the
one
bell
went
and
we
roused
out
the
other
watch
and
told
them
what
jinks
we
had
been
up
to
i
must
be
rocky
one
of
the
men
remarked
not
said
another
bin
forty
winks
on
the
break
dreemed
come
on
visit
friendly
like
there
was
some
laughter
at
this
suggestion
and
i
caught
myself
smiling
along
with
the
rest
though
i
had
no
reason
for
sharing
their
belief
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
all
might
been
a
stowaway
yer
know
i
heard
quoin
the
one
who
had
suggested
it
before
remark
to
one
of
the
named
stubbins
a
short
rather
chap
might
have
been
hell
returned
stubbins
stowaways
hai
such
fools
as
all
that
i
dunno
said
the
first
i
wish
i
arsked
the
second
what
thought
about
it
i
do
think
it
was
a
stowaway
somehow
i
said
chipping
in
what
would
a
stowaway
want
aloft
i
guess
he
be
trying
more
for
the
steward
pantry
you
bet
he
would
hevry
time
said
stubbins
he
lit
his
pipe
and
sucked
at
it
slowly
i
do
hunderstand
it
all
ther
same
he
remarked
after
a
silence
neither
do
i
i
said
and
after
that
i
was
quiet
for
a
while
listening
to
the
run
of
conversation
on
the
subject
presently
my
glance
fell
upon
williams
the
man
who
had
spoken
to
me
about
shadders
he
was
sitting
in
his
bunk
smoking
and
making
no
effort
to
join
in
the
talk
i
went
across
to
him
what
do
you
think
of
it
williams
i
asked
do
think
the
second
mate
really
saw
anything
he
looked
at
me
with
a
sort
of
gloomy
suspicion
but
said
nothing
i
felt
a
trifle
annoyed
by
his
silence
but
took
care
not
to
show
it
after
a
few
moments
i
went
on
do
you
know
williams
i
beginning
to
understand
what
you
meant
that
night
when
you
said
there
were
too
many
shadows
wot
yer
mean
he
said
pulling
his
pipe
from
out
of
his
mouth
and
fairly
surprised
into
answering
what
i
say
of
course
i
said
there
too
many
shadows
he
sat
up
and
leant
forward
out
from
his
bunk
extending
his
hand
and
pipe
his
eyes
plainly
showed
his
excitement
yer
seen
he
hesitated
and
looked
at
me
struggling
inwardly
to
express
himself
well
i
prompted
for
perhaps
a
minute
he
tried
to
say
something
then
his
expression
altered
suddenly
from
doubt
and
something
else
more
indefinite
to
a
pretty
grim
look
of
determination
he
spoke
i
blimed
he
said
ef
i
do
tike
er
out
of
shadders
or
no
shadders
i
looked
at
him
with
astonishment
what
it
got
to
do
with
your
getting
a
out
of
her
i
asked
he
nodded
his
head
with
a
sort
of
stolid
resolution
look
he
said
i
waited
ther
crowd
cleared
he
indicated
with
his
hand
and
pipe
towards
the
stern
you
mean
in
i
said
yus
he
replied
withart
er
cent
of
ther
piy
i
styied
i
comprehended
him
suddenly
you
think
they
saw
i
hesitated
then
i
said
shadows
he
nodded
but
said
nothing
and
so
they
all
bunked
he
nodded
again
and
began
tapping
out
his
pipe
on
the
edge
of
his
and
the
officers
and
the
skipper
i
asked
fresh
uns
he
said
and
got
out
of
his
bunk
for
eight
bells
was
striking
iv
fooling
with
the
it
was
on
the
friday
night
that
the
second
mate
had
the
watch
aloft
looking
for
the
man
up
the
main
and
for
the
next
five
days
little
else
was
talked
about
though
with
the
exception
of
williams
tammy
and
myself
no
one
seemed
to
think
of
treating
the
matter
seriously
perhaps
i
should
not
exclude
quoin
who
still
persisted
on
every
occasion
that
there
was
a
stowaway
aboard
as
for
the
second
mate
i
have
very
little
doubt
but
that
he
was
beginning
to
realise
there
was
something
deeper
and
less
understandable
than
he
had
at
first
dreamed
of
yet
all
the
same
i
know
he
had
to
keep
his
guesses
and
opinions
pretty
well
to
himself
for
the
old
man
and
the
first
mate
chaffed
him
unmercifully
about
his
bogy
this
i
got
from
tammy
who
had
heard
them
both
ragging
him
during
the
second
the
following
day
there
was
another
thing
tammy
told
me
that
showed
how
the
second
mate
bothered
about
his
inability
to
understand
the
mysterious
appearance
and
disappearance
of
the
man
he
had
seen
go
aloft
he
had
made
tammy
give
him
every
detail
he
could
remember
about
the
figure
we
had
seen
by
the
what
is
more
the
second
had
not
even
affected
to
treat
the
matter
lightly
nor
as
a
thing
to
be
sneered
at
but
had
listened
seriously
and
asked
a
great
many
questions
it
is
very
evident
to
me
that
he
was
reaching
out
towards
the
only
possible
conclusion
though
goodness
knows
it
was
one
that
was
impossible
and
improbable
enough
it
was
on
the
wednesday
night
after
the
five
days
of
talk
i
have
mentioned
that
there
came
to
me
and
to
those
who
another
element
of
fear
and
yet
i
can
quite
understand
that
at
time
those
who
had
seen
nothing
would
find
little
to
be
afraid
of
in
all
that
i
am
going
to
tell
you
still
even
they
were
much
puzzled
and
astonished
and
perhaps
after
all
a
little
awed
there
was
so
much
in
the
affair
that
was
inexplicable
and
yet
again
such
a
lot
that
was
natural
and
commonplace
for
when
all
is
said
and
done
it
was
nothing
more
than
the
blowing
adrift
of
one
of
the
sails
yet
accompanied
by
what
were
really
significant
details
significant
that
is
in
the
light
of
that
which
tammy
and
i
and
the
second
mate
knew
seven
bells
and
then
one
had
gone
in
the
first
watch
and
our
side
was
being
roused
out
to
relieve
the
mate
most
of
the
men
were
already
out
of
their
bunks
and
sitting
about
on
their
getting
into
their
togs
suddenly
one
of
the
in
the
other
watch
put
his
head
in
through
the
doorway
on
the
port
side
the
mate
wants
to
know
he
said
which
of
you
chaps
made
fast
the
fore
royal
last
watch
wot
want
to
know
that
for
inquired
one
of
the
men
the
lee
side
blowing
adrift
said
the
and
he
says
that
the
chap
who
made
it
fast
is
to
go
up
and
see
to
it
as
soon
as
the
watch
is
relieved
oh
does
well
was
me
replied
the
man
you
better
arsk
sum
of
ask
what
inquired
plummer
getting
out
of
his
bunk
sleepily
the
repeated
his
message
the
man
yawned
and
stretched
himself
let
me
see
he
muttered
and
scratched
his
head
with
one
hand
while
he
fumbled
for
his
trousers
with
the
other
made
ther
fore
fast
he
got
into
his
trousers
and
stood
up
why
ther
er
course
else
do
yer
suppose
that
all
i
wanted
to
know
said
the
and
went
away
hi
tom
stubbins
sung
out
to
the
ordinary
wake
up
you
lazy
young
devil
ther
mate
just
sent
to
hinquire
who
it
was
made
the
fore
royal
fast
it
all
blowin
adrift
and
he
says
you
to
get
along
up
as
soon
as
eight
bells
goes
and
make
it
fast
again
tom
jumped
out
of
his
bunk
and
began
to
dress
quickly
blowin
adrift
he
said
there
ai
all
that
much
wind
and
i
tucked
the
ends
of
the
gaskets
well
in
under
the
other
turns
one
of
ther
gaskets
is
rotten
and
given
way
suggested
stubbins
anyway
you
better
hurry
up
it
just
on
eight
bells
a
minute
later
eight
bells
went
and
we
trooped
away
aft
for
as
soon
as
the
names
were
called
over
i
saw
the
mate
lean
towards
the
second
and
say
something
then
the
second
mate
sung
out
tom
sir
answered
tom
was
it
you
made
fast
that
fore
royal
last
watch
yes
sir
how
that
it
broken
adrift
car
say
sir
well
it
has
and
you
better
jump
aloft
and
shove
the
gasket
round
it
again
and
mind
you
make
a
better
job
of
it
this
time
i
i
sir
said
tom
and
followed
the
rest
of
us
forrard
reaching
the
fore
rigging
he
climbed
into
it
and
began
to
make
his
way
leisurely
aloft
i
could
see
him
with
a
fair
amount
of
distinctness
as
the
moon
was
very
clear
and
bright
though
getting
old
i
went
over
to
the
weather
and
leaned
up
against
it
watching
him
while
i
filled
my
pipe
the
other
men
both
the
watch
on
deck
and
the
watch
below
had
gone
into
the
so
that
i
imagined
i
was
the
only
one
about
the
maindeck
yet
a
minute
later
i
discovered
that
i
was
mistaken
for
as
i
proceeded
to
light
up
i
saw
williams
the
young
cockney
come
out
from
under
the
lee
of
the
house
and
turn
and
look
up
at
the
ordinary
as
he
went
steadily
upwards
i
was
a
little
surprised
as
i
knew
he
and
three
of
the
others
had
a
poker
fight
on
and
he
won
over
sixty
pounds
of
tobacco
i
believe
i
opened
my
mouth
to
sing
out
to
him
to
know
why
he
was
playing
and
then
all
at
once
there
came
into
my
mind
the
memory
of
my
first
conversation
with
him
i
remembered
that
he
had
said
sails
were
always
blowing
adrift
i
remembered
the
then
unaccountable
emphasis
he
had
laid
on
those
two
words
and
remembering
that
i
felt
suddenly
afraid
for
all
at
once
the
absurdity
had
struck
me
of
a
sail
even
a
badly
stowed
one
blowing
adrift
in
such
fine
and
calm
weather
as
we
were
then
having
i
wondered
i
had
not
seen
before
that
there
was
something
queer
and
unlikely
about
the
affair
sails
do
blow
adrift
in
fine
weather
with
the
sea
calm
and
the
ship
as
steady
as
a
rock
i
moved
away
from
the
rail
and
went
towards
williams
he
knew
something
or
at
least
he
guessed
at
something
that
was
very
much
a
blankness
to
me
at
that
time
up
above
the
boy
was
climbing
up
to
what
that
was
the
thing
that
made
me
feel
so
frightened
ought
i
to
tell
all
i
knew
and
guessed
and
then
who
should
i
tell
i
should
only
be
laughed
at
i
williams
turned
towards
me
and
spoke
gawd
he
said
it
started
agen
what
i
said
though
i
knew
what
he
meant
them
syles
he
answered
and
made
a
gesture
towards
the
fore
royal
i
glanced
up
briefly
all
the
lee
side
of
the
sail
was
adrift
from
the
bunt
gasket
outwards
lower
i
saw
tom
he
was
just
hoisting
himself
into
the
rigging
williams
spoke
again
we
lost
two
on
just
sime
way
comin
art
two
of
the
men
i
exclaimed
yus
he
said
tersely
i
ca
understand
i
went
on
i
never
heard
anything
about
it
who
yer
got
ter
tell
yer
abart
it
he
asked
i
made
no
reply
to
his
question
indeed
i
had
scarcely
comprehended
it
for
the
problem
of
what
i
ought
to
do
in
the
matter
had
risen
again
in
my
mind
i
a
good
mind
to
go
aft
and
tell
the
second
mate
all
i
know
i
said
he
seen
something
himself
that
he
ca
explain
away
and
and
anyway
i
ca
stand
this
state
of
things
if
the
second
mate
knew
all
garn
he
cut
in
interrupting
me
an
be
told
yer
a
blastid
hidiot
not
yer
yer
sty
were
yer
are
i
stood
irresolute
what
he
had
said
was
perfectly
correct
and
i
was
positively
stumped
what
to
do
for
the
best
that
there
was
danger
aloft
i
was
convinced
though
if
i
had
been
asked
my
reasons
for
supposing
this
they
would
have
been
hard
to
find
yet
of
its
existence
i
was
as
certain
as
though
my
eyes
already
saw
it
i
wondered
whether
being
so
ignorant
of
the
form
it
would
assume
i
could
stop
it
by
joining
tom
on
the
yard
this
thought
came
as
i
stared
up
at
the
royal
tom
had
reached
the
sail
and
was
standing
on
the
close
in
to
the
bunt
he
was
bending
over
the
yard
and
reaching
down
for
the
slack
of
the
sail
and
then
as
i
looked
i
saw
the
belly
of
the
royal
tossed
up
and
down
abruptly
as
though
a
sudden
heavy
gust
of
wind
had
caught
it
i
blimed
williams
began
with
a
sort
of
excited
expectation
and
then
he
stopped
as
abruptly
as
he
had
begun
for
in
a
moment
the
sail
had
thrashed
right
over
the
after
side
of
the
yard
apparently
knocking
tom
clean
from
off
the
my
god
i
shouted
out
loud
he
gone
for
an
instant
there
was
a
blur
over
my
eyes
and
williams
was
singing
out
something
that
i
could
not
catch
then
just
as
quickly
it
went
and
i
could
see
again
clearly
williams
was
pointing
and
i
saw
something
black
swinging
below
the
yard
williams
called
out
something
fresh
and
made
a
run
for
the
fore
rigging
i
caught
the
last
part
ther
garskit
straightway
i
knew
that
tom
had
managed
to
grab
the
gasket
as
he
fell
and
i
bolted
after
williams
to
give
him
a
hand
in
getting
the
youngster
into
safety
down
on
deck
i
caught
the
sound
of
running
feet
and
then
the
second
mate
voice
he
was
asking
what
the
devil
was
up
but
i
did
not
trouble
to
answer
him
then
i
wanted
all
my
breath
to
help
me
aloft
i
knew
very
well
that
some
of
the
gaskets
were
little
better
than
old
shakins
and
unless
tom
got
hold
of
something
on
the
yard
below
him
he
might
come
down
with
a
run
any
moment
i
reached
the
top
and
lifted
myself
over
it
in
quick
time
williams
was
some
distance
above
me
in
less
than
half
a
minute
i
reached
the
yard
williams
had
gone
up
on
to
the
royal
i
slid
out
on
to
the
until
i
was
just
below
tom
then
i
sung
out
to
him
to
let
himself
down
to
me
and
i
would
catch
him
he
made
no
answer
and
i
saw
that
he
was
hanging
in
a
curiously
limp
fashion
and
by
one
hand
williams
voice
came
down
to
me
from
the
royal
yard
he
was
singing
out
to
me
to
go
up
and
give
him
a
hand
to
pull
tom
up
on
to
the
yard
when
i
reached
him
he
told
me
that
the
gasket
had
hitched
itself
round
the
lad
wrist
i
bent
beside
the
yard
and
peered
down
it
was
as
williams
had
said
and
i
realised
how
near
a
thing
it
had
been
strangely
enough
even
at
that
moment
the
thought
came
to
me
how
little
wind
there
was
i
remembered
the
wild
way
in
which
the
sail
had
lashed
at
the
boy
all
this
time
i
was
busily
working
unreeving
the
port
buntline
i
took
the
end
made
a
running
bowline
with
it
round
the
gasket
and
let
the
loop
slide
down
over
the
boy
head
and
shoulders
then
i
took
a
strain
on
it
and
tightened
it
under
his
arms
a
minute
later
we
had
him
safely
on
the
yard
between
us
in
the
uncertain
moonlight
i
could
just
make
out
the
mark
of
a
great
lump
on
his
forehead
where
the
foot
of
the
sail
must
have
caught
him
when
it
knocked
him
over
as
we
stood
there
a
moment
taking
our
breath
i
caught
the
sound
of
the
second
mate
voice
close
beneath
us
williams
glanced
down
then
he
looked
up
at
me
and
gave
a
short
grunting
laugh
crikey
he
said
what
up
i
asked
quickly
he
jerked
his
head
backwards
and
downwards
i
screwed
round
a
bit
holding
the
jackstay
with
one
hand
and
steadying
the
insensible
ordinary
with
the
other
in
this
way
i
could
look
below
at
first
i
could
see
nothing
then
the
second
mate
voice
came
up
to
me
again
who
the
hell
are
you
what
are
you
doing
i
saw
him
now
he
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
weather
rigging
his
face
was
turned
upwards
peering
round
the
after
side
of
the
mast
it
showed
to
me
only
as
a
blurred
oval
in
the
moonlight
he
repeated
his
question
it
williams
and
i
sir
i
said
tom
here
has
had
an
accident
i
stopped
he
began
to
come
up
higher
towards
us
from
the
rigging
to
leeward
there
came
suddenly
a
buzz
of
men
talking
the
second
mate
reached
us
well
what
up
anyway
he
inquired
suspiciously
what
happened
he
had
bent
forward
and
was
peering
at
tom
i
started
to
explain
but
he
cut
me
short
with
is
he
dead
no
sir
i
said
i
do
think
so
but
the
poor
beggar
had
a
bad
fall
he
was
hanging
by
the
gasket
when
we
got
to
him
the
sail
knocked
him
off
the
yard
what
he
said
sharply
the
wind
caught
the
sail
and
it
lashed
back
over
the
yard
what
wind
he
interrupted
there
no
wind
scarcely
he
shifted
his
weight
on
to
the
other
foot
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
what
i
say
sir
the
wind
brought
the
foot
of
the
sail
over
the
top
of
the
yard
and
knocked
tom
clean
off
the
williams
and
i
both
saw
it
happen
but
there
no
wind
to
do
such
a
thing
you
talking
nonsense
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
as
much
of
bewilderment
as
anything
else
in
his
voice
yet
i
could
tell
that
he
was
suspicious
though
of
what
i
doubted
whether
he
himself
could
have
told
he
glanced
at
williams
and
seemed
about
to
say
something
then
seeming
to
change
his
mind
he
turned
and
sung
out
to
one
of
the
men
who
had
followed
him
aloft
to
go
down
and
pass
out
a
coil
of
new
manilla
and
a
tailblock
smartly
now
he
concluded
i
i
sir
said
the
man
and
went
down
swiftly
the
second
mate
turned
to
me
when
you
got
tom
below
i
shall
want
a
better
explanation
of
all
this
than
the
one
you
given
me
it
wo
very
well
sir
i
answered
but
you
wo
get
any
other
what
do
you
mean
he
shouted
at
me
i
let
you
know
i
have
no
impertinence
from
you
or
any
one
else
i
do
mean
any
impertinence
sir
i
mean
that
it
the
only
explanation
there
is
to
give
i
tell
you
it
wo
wash
he
repeated
there
something
too
damned
funny
about
it
all
i
shall
have
to
report
the
matter
to
the
captain
i
ca
tell
him
that
yarn
he
broke
off
abruptly
it
not
the
only
damned
funny
thing
that
happened
aboard
this
old
hooker
i
answered
you
ought
to
know
that
sir
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
quickly
well
sir
i
said
to
be
straight
what
about
that
chap
you
sent
us
hunting
after
up
the
main
the
other
night
that
was
a
funny
enough
affair
was
it
this
one
is
half
so
funny
that
will
do
jessop
he
said
angrily
i
wo
have
any
back
talk
yet
there
was
something
about
his
tone
that
told
me
i
had
got
one
in
on
my
own
he
seemed
all
at
once
less
able
to
appear
confident
that
i
was
telling
him
a
fairy
tale
after
that
for
perhaps
half
a
minute
he
said
nothing
i
guessed
he
was
doing
some
hard
thinking
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
on
the
matter
of
getting
the
ordinary
down
on
deck
one
of
you
have
to
go
down
the
lee
side
and
steady
him
down
he
concluded
he
turned
and
looked
downwards
are
you
bringing
that
gantline
he
sang
out
yes
sir
i
heard
one
of
the
men
answer
a
moment
later
i
saw
the
man
head
appear
over
the
top
he
had
the
slung
round
his
neck
and
the
end
of
the
gantline
over
his
shoulder
very
soon
we
had
the
gantline
rigged
and
tom
down
on
deck
then
we
took
him
into
the
and
put
him
in
his
bunk
the
second
mate
had
sent
for
some
brandy
and
now
he
started
to
dose
him
well
with
it
at
the
same
time
a
couple
of
the
men
chafed
his
hands
and
feet
in
a
little
he
began
to
show
signs
of
coming
round
presently
after
a
sudden
fit
of
coughing
he
opened
his
eyes
with
a
surprised
bewildered
stare
then
he
caught
at
the
edge
of
his
and
sat
up
giddily
one
of
the
men
steadied
him
while
the
second
mate
stood
back
and
eyed
him
critically
the
boy
rocked
as
he
sat
and
put
up
his
hand
to
his
head
here
said
the
second
mate
take
another
drink
tom
caught
his
breath
and
choked
a
little
then
he
spoke
by
gum
he
said
my
head
does
ache
he
put
up
his
hand
again
and
felt
at
the
lump
on
his
forehead
then
he
bent
forward
and
stared
round
at
the
men
grouped
about
his
bunk
what
up
he
inquired
in
a
confused
sort
of
way
and
seeming
as
if
he
could
not
see
us
clearly
what
up
he
asked
again
that
just
what
i
want
to
know
said
the
second
mate
speaking
for
the
first
time
with
some
sternness
i
ai
been
snoozin
while
there
been
a
job
on
tom
inquired
anxiously
he
looked
round
at
the
men
appealingly
it
knocked
dotty
strikes
me
said
one
of
the
men
audibly
no
i
said
answering
tom
question
you
had
shut
that
jessop
said
the
second
mate
quickly
interrupting
me
i
want
to
hear
what
the
boy
got
to
say
for
himself
he
turned
again
to
tom
you
were
up
at
the
fore
royal
he
prompted
i
car
say
i
was
sir
said
tom
doubtfully
i
could
see
that
he
had
not
gripped
the
second
mate
meaning
but
you
were
said
the
second
with
some
impatience
it
was
blowing
adrift
and
i
sent
you
up
to
shove
a
gasket
round
it
blowin
adrift
sir
said
tom
dully
yes
blowing
adrift
do
i
speak
plainly
the
dullness
went
from
tom
face
suddenly
so
it
was
sir
he
said
his
memory
returning
the
bloomin
sail
got
chock
full
of
wind
it
caught
me
bang
in
the
face
he
paused
a
moment
i
believe
he
began
and
then
stopped
once
more
go
on
said
the
second
mate
spit
it
out
i
do
know
sir
tom
said
i
do
understand
he
hesitated
again
that
all
i
can
remember
he
muttered
and
put
his
hand
up
to
the
bruise
on
his
forehead
as
though
trying
to
remember
something
in
the
momentary
silence
that
succeeded
i
caught
the
voice
of
stubbins
there
hai
hardly
no
wind
he
was
saying
in
a
puzzled
tone
there
was
a
low
murmur
of
assent
from
the
surrounding
men
the
second
mate
said
nothing
and
i
glanced
at
him
curiously
was
he
beginning
to
see
i
wondered
how
useless
it
was
to
try
to
find
any
sensible
explanation
of
the
affair
had
he
begun
at
last
to
couple
it
with
that
peculiar
business
of
the
man
up
the
main
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
this
was
so
for
after
staring
a
few
moments
at
tom
in
a
doubtful
sort
of
way
he
went
out
of
the
saying
that
he
would
inquire
further
into
the
matter
in
the
morning
yet
when
the
morning
came
he
did
no
such
thing
as
for
his
reporting
the
affair
to
the
skipper
i
much
doubt
it
even
did
he
it
must
have
been
in
a
very
casual
way
for
we
heard
nothing
more
about
it
though
of
course
we
talked
it
over
pretty
thoroughly
among
ourselves
with
regard
to
the
second
mate
even
now
i
am
rather
puzzled
by
his
attitude
to
us
aloft
sometimes
i
have
thought
that
he
must
have
suspected
us
of
trying
to
play
off
some
trick
on
him
perhaps
at
the
time
he
still
half
suspected
one
of
us
of
being
in
some
way
connected
with
the
other
business
or
again
he
may
have
been
trying
to
fight
against
the
conviction
that
was
being
forced
upon
him
that
there
was
really
something
impossible
and
beastly
about
the
old
packet
of
course
these
are
only
suppositions
and
then
close
upon
this
there
were
further
developments
v
end
of
as
i
have
said
there
was
a
lot
of
talk
among
the
crowd
of
us
forrard
about
tom
strange
accident
none
of
the
men
knew
that
williams
and
i
had
seen
it
stubbins
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
tom
had
been
sleepy
and
missed
the
tom
of
course
would
not
have
this
by
any
means
yet
he
had
no
one
to
appeal
to
for
at
that
time
he
was
just
as
ignorant
as
the
rest
that
we
had
seen
the
sail
flap
up
over
the
yard
stubbins
insisted
that
it
stood
to
reason
it
could
be
the
wind
there
was
any
he
said
and
the
rest
of
the
men
agreed
with
him
well
i
said
i
do
know
about
all
that
i
a
bit
inclined
to
think
tom
yarn
is
the
truth
how
do
you
make
that
hout
stubbins
asked
unbelievingly
there
haint
nothin
like
enough
wind
what
about
the
place
on
his
forehead
i
inquired
in
turn
how
are
you
going
to
explain
that
i
he
knocked
himself
there
when
he
slipped
he
answered
likely
agreed
old
jaskett
who
was
sitting
smoking
on
a
chest
near
by
well
you
both
a
damn
long
way
out
of
it
tom
chipped
in
pretty
warm
i
was
asleep
an
the
sail
did
bloomin
well
hit
me
do
you
be
impertinent
young
feller
said
jaskett
i
joined
in
again
there
another
thing
stubbins
i
said
the
gasket
tom
was
hanging
by
was
on
the
after
side
of
the
yard
that
looks
as
if
the
sail
might
have
flapped
it
over
if
there
were
wind
enough
to
do
the
one
it
seems
to
me
that
it
might
have
done
the
other
do
you
mean
that
it
was
hunder
ther
yard
or
hover
ther
top
he
asked
over
the
top
of
course
what
more
the
foot
of
the
sail
was
hanging
over
the
after
part
of
the
yard
in
a
bight
stubbins
was
plainly
surprised
at
that
and
before
he
was
ready
with
his
next
objection
plummer
spoke
saw
it
he
asked
i
saw
it
i
said
a
bit
sharply
so
did
williams
so
for
that
matter
did
the
second
mate
plummer
relapsed
into
silence
and
smoked
and
stubbins
broke
out
afresh
i
reckon
tom
must
have
had
a
hold
of
the
foot
and
the
gasket
and
pulled
hover
the
yard
when
he
tumbled
no
interrupted
tom
the
gasket
was
under
the
sail
i
could
even
see
it
an
i
had
time
to
get
hold
of
the
foot
of
the
sail
before
it
up
and
caught
me
smack
in
the
face
did
yer
get
er
ther
gasket
when
yer
fell
then
asked
plummer
he
did
get
hold
of
it
i
answered
for
tom
it
had
taken
a
turn
round
his
wrist
and
that
how
we
found
him
hanging
do
you
mean
to
say
as
got
of
ther
garsket
quoin
inquired
pausing
in
the
lighting
of
his
pipe
of
course
i
do
i
said
a
chap
does
go
hanging
on
to
a
rope
when
he
jolly
well
been
knocked
senseless
ye
richt
assented
jock
ye
quite
richt
there
jessop
quoin
concluded
the
lighting
of
his
pipe
i
dunno
he
said
i
went
on
without
noticing
him
anyway
when
williams
and
i
found
him
he
was
hanging
by
the
gasket
and
it
had
a
couple
of
turns
round
his
wrist
and
besides
that
as
i
said
before
the
foot
of
the
sail
was
hanging
over
the
after
side
of
the
yard
and
tom
weight
on
the
gasket
was
holding
it
there
it
damned
queer
said
stubbins
in
a
puzzled
voice
there
seem
to
be
no
way
of
gettin
a
proper
hexplanation
to
it
i
glanced
at
williams
to
suggest
that
i
should
tell
all
that
we
had
seen
but
he
shook
his
head
and
after
a
moment
thought
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
so
doing
we
had
no
very
clear
idea
of
the
thing
that
had
happened
and
our
half
facts
and
guesses
would
only
have
tended
to
make
the
matter
appear
more
grotesque
and
unlikely
the
only
thing
to
be
done
was
to
wait
and
watch
if
we
could
only
get
hold
of
something
tangible
then
we
might
hope
to
tell
all
that
we
knew
without
being
made
into
i
came
out
from
my
think
abruptly
stubbins
was
speaking
again
he
was
arguing
the
matter
with
one
of
the
other
men
you
see
with
there
bein
no
wind
scarcely
ther
thing
himpossible
an
yet
the
other
man
interrupted
with
some
remark
i
did
not
catch
no
i
heard
stubbins
say
i
hout
of
my
reckonin
i
do
savvy
it
one
bit
it
too
much
like
a
damned
fairy
tale
look
at
his
wrist
i
said
tom
held
out
his
right
hand
and
arm
for
inspection
it
was
considerably
swollen
where
the
rope
had
been
round
it
yes
admitted
stubbins
that
right
enough
but
it
do
tell
you
nothin
i
made
no
reply
as
stubbins
said
it
told
you
nothin
and
there
i
let
it
drop
yet
i
have
told
you
this
as
showing
how
the
matter
was
regarded
in
the
still
it
did
not
occupy
our
minds
very
long
for
as
i
have
said
there
were
further
developments
the
three
following
nights
passed
quietly
and
then
on
the
fourth
all
those
curious
signs
and
hints
culminated
suddenly
in
something
extraordinarily
grim
yet
everything
had
been
so
subtle
and
intangible
and
indeed
so
was
the
affair
itself
that
only
those
who
had
actually
come
in
touch
with
the
invading
fear
seemed
really
capable
of
comprehending
the
terror
of
the
thing
the
men
for
the
most
part
began
to
say
the
ship
was
unlucky
and
of
course
as
usual
there
was
some
talk
of
there
being
a
jonah
in
the
ship
still
i
can
not
say
that
none
of
the
men
realised
there
was
anything
horrible
and
frightening
in
it
all
for
i
am
sure
that
some
did
a
little
and
i
think
stubbins
was
certainly
one
of
them
though
i
feel
certain
that
he
did
not
at
that
time
you
know
grasp
a
quarter
of
the
real
significance
that
underlay
the
several
queer
matters
that
had
disturbed
our
nights
he
seemed
to
fail
somehow
to
grasp
the
element
of
personal
danger
that
to
me
was
already
plain
he
lacked
sufficient
imagination
i
suppose
to
piece
the
things
together
to
trace
the
natural
sequence
of
the
events
and
their
development
yet
i
must
not
forget
of
course
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
those
two
first
incidents
if
he
had
perhaps
he
might
have
stood
where
i
did
as
it
was
he
had
not
seemed
to
reach
out
at
all
you
know
not
even
in
the
matter
of
tom
and
the
fore
royal
now
however
after
the
thing
i
am
about
to
tell
you
he
seemed
to
see
a
little
way
into
the
darkness
and
realise
possibilities
i
remember
the
fourth
night
well
it
was
a
clear
moonless
sort
of
night
at
least
i
think
there
was
no
moon
or
at
any
rate
the
moon
could
have
been
little
more
than
a
thin
crescent
for
it
was
near
the
dark
time
the
wind
had
breezed
up
a
bit
but
still
remained
steady
we
were
slipping
along
at
about
six
or
seven
knots
an
hour
it
was
our
middle
watch
on
deck
and
the
ship
was
full
of
the
blow
and
hum
of
the
wind
aloft
williams
and
i
were
the
only
ones
about
the
maindeck
he
was
leaning
over
the
weather
smoking
while
i
was
pacing
up
and
down
between
him
and
the
fore
hatch
stubbins
was
on
the
two
bells
had
gone
some
minutes
and
i
was
wishing
to
goodness
that
it
was
eight
and
time
to
suddenly
overhead
there
sounded
a
sharp
crack
like
the
report
of
a
rifle
shot
it
was
followed
instantly
by
the
rattle
and
crash
of
sailcloth
thrashing
in
the
wind
williams
jumped
away
from
the
rail
and
ran
aft
a
few
steps
i
followed
him
and
together
we
stared
upwards
to
see
what
had
gone
indistinctly
i
made
out
that
the
weather
sheet
of
the
fore
had
carried
away
and
the
clew
of
the
sail
was
whirling
and
banging
about
in
the
air
and
every
few
moments
hitting
the
steel
yard
a
blow
like
the
thump
of
a
great
sledge
hammer
it
the
shackle
or
one
of
the
links
that
gone
i
think
i
shouted
to
williams
above
the
noise
of
the
sail
that
the
spectacle
hitting
the
yard
yus
he
shouted
back
and
went
to
get
hold
of
the
clewline
i
ran
to
give
him
a
hand
at
the
same
moment
i
caught
the
second
mate
voice
away
aft
shouting
then
came
the
noise
of
running
feet
and
the
rest
of
the
watch
and
the
second
mate
were
with
us
almost
at
the
same
moment
in
a
few
minutes
we
had
the
yard
lowered
and
the
sail
clewed
up
then
williams
and
i
went
aloft
to
see
where
the
sheet
had
gone
it
was
much
as
i
had
supposed
the
spectacle
was
all
right
but
the
pin
had
gone
out
of
the
shackle
and
the
shackle
itself
was
jammed
into
the
sheavehole
in
the
yard
arm
williams
sent
me
down
for
another
pin
while
he
unbent
the
clewline
and
overhauled
it
down
to
the
sheet
when
i
returned
with
the
fresh
pin
i
screwed
it
into
the
shackle
clipped
on
the
clewline
and
sung
out
to
the
men
to
take
a
pull
on
the
rope
this
they
did
and
at
the
second
heave
the
shackle
came
away
when
it
was
high
enough
i
went
up
on
to
the
yard
and
held
the
chain
while
williams
shackled
it
into
the
spectacle
then
he
bent
on
the
clewline
afresh
and
sung
out
to
the
second
mate
that
we
were
ready
to
hoist
away
yer
better
go
down
an
give
a
he
said
i
sty
an
light
up
ther
syle
right
ho
williams
i
said
getting
into
the
rigging
do
let
the
ship
bogy
run
away
with
you
this
remark
i
made
in
a
moment
of
such
as
will
come
to
anyone
aloft
at
times
i
was
exhilarated
for
the
time
being
and
quite
free
from
the
sense
of
fear
that
had
been
with
me
so
much
of
late
i
suppose
this
was
due
to
the
freshness
of
the
wind
there
more
one
he
said
in
that
curiously
short
way
of
his
what
i
asked
he
repeated
his
remark
i
was
suddenly
serious
the
of
all
the
impossible
details
of
the
past
weeks
came
back
to
me
vivid
and
beastly
what
do
you
mean
williams
i
asked
him
but
he
had
shut
up
and
would
say
nothing
what
do
you
know
how
much
do
you
know
i
went
on
quickly
why
did
you
never
tell
me
that
you
the
second
mate
voice
interrupted
me
abruptly
now
then
up
there
are
you
going
to
keep
us
waiting
all
night
one
of
you
come
down
and
give
us
a
pull
with
the
the
other
stay
up
and
light
up
the
gear
i
i
sir
i
shouted
back
then
i
turned
to
williams
hurriedly
look
here
williams
i
said
if
you
think
there
is
a
danger
in
your
being
alone
up
here
i
hesitated
for
words
to
express
what
i
meant
then
i
went
on
well
i
jolly
well
stay
up
with
you
the
second
mate
voice
came
again
come
on
now
one
of
you
make
a
move
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
coming
sir
i
sung
out
shall
i
stay
i
asked
definitely
garn
he
said
do
yer
fret
yerself
i
tike
er
bloomin
out
of
blarst
i
ai
funky
of
i
went
that
was
the
last
word
williams
spoke
to
anyone
living
i
reached
the
decks
and
tailed
on
to
the
haulyards
we
had
nearly
the
yard
and
the
second
mate
was
looking
up
at
the
dark
outline
of
the
sail
ready
to
sing
out
belay
when
all
at
once
there
came
a
queer
sort
of
muffled
shout
from
williams
vast
hauling
you
men
shouted
the
second
mate
we
stood
silent
and
listened
what
that
williams
he
sung
out
are
you
all
clear
for
nearly
half
a
minute
we
stood
listening
but
there
came
no
reply
some
of
the
men
said
afterwards
that
they
had
noticed
a
curious
rattling
and
vibrating
noise
aloft
that
sounded
faintly
above
the
hum
and
swirl
of
the
wind
like
the
sound
of
loose
ropes
being
shaken
and
slatted
together
you
know
whether
this
noise
was
really
heard
or
whether
it
was
something
that
had
no
existence
outside
of
their
imaginations
i
can
not
say
i
heard
nothing
of
it
but
then
i
was
at
the
tail
end
of
the
rope
and
furthest
from
the
fore
rigging
while
those
who
heard
it
were
on
the
fore
part
of
the
haulyards
and
close
up
to
the
shrouds
the
second
mate
put
his
hands
to
his
mouth
are
you
all
clear
there
he
shouted
again
the
answer
came
unintelligible
and
unexpected
it
ran
like
this
blarst
yer
i
styed
did
yer
think
drive
bl
y
and
then
there
was
a
sudden
silence
i
stared
up
at
the
dim
sail
astonished
he
dotty
said
stubbins
who
had
been
told
to
come
off
the
and
give
us
a
pull
as
mad
as
a
bloomin
said
quoin
who
was
standing
foreside
of
me
been
queer
all
along
silence
there
shouted
the
second
mate
then
williams
no
answer
williams
more
loudly
still
no
answer
then
damn
you
you
cockney
crocodile
ca
you
hear
are
you
deaf
there
was
no
answer
and
the
second
mate
turned
to
me
jump
aloft
smartly
now
jessop
and
see
what
wrong
i
i
sir
i
said
and
made
a
run
for
the
rigging
i
felt
a
bit
queer
had
williams
gone
mad
he
certainly
always
had
been
a
bit
funny
or
and
the
thought
came
with
a
jump
had
he
seen
i
did
not
finish
suddenly
up
aloft
there
sounded
a
frightful
scream
i
stopped
with
my
hand
on
the
sheerpole
the
next
instant
something
fell
out
of
the
darkness
a
heavy
body
that
struck
the
deck
near
the
waiting
men
with
a
tremendous
crash
and
a
loud
ringing
wheezy
sound
that
sickened
me
several
of
the
men
shouted
out
loud
in
their
fright
and
let
go
of
the
haulyards
but
luckily
the
stopper
held
it
and
the
yard
did
not
come
down
then
for
the
space
of
several
seconds
there
was
a
dead
silence
among
the
crowd
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
wind
had
in
it
a
strange
moaning
note
the
second
mate
was
the
first
to
speak
his
voice
came
so
abruptly
that
it
startled
me
get
a
light
one
of
you
quick
now
there
was
a
moment
hesitation
fetch
one
of
the
binnacle
lamps
you
tammy
i
i
sir
the
youngster
said
in
a
quavering
voice
and
ran
aft
in
less
than
a
minute
i
saw
the
light
coming
towards
us
along
the
deck
the
boy
was
running
he
reached
us
and
handed
the
lamp
to
the
second
mate
who
took
it
and
went
towards
the
dark
huddled
heap
on
the
deck
he
held
the
light
out
before
him
and
peered
at
the
thing
my
god
he
said
it
williams
he
stooped
lower
with
the
light
and
i
saw
details
it
was
williams
right
enough
the
second
mate
told
a
couple
of
the
men
to
lift
him
and
straighten
him
out
on
the
hatch
then
he
went
aft
to
call
the
skipper
he
returned
in
a
couple
of
minutes
with
an
old
ensign
which
he
spread
over
the
poor
beggar
almost
directly
the
captain
came
hurrying
forward
along
the
decks
he
pulled
back
one
end
of
the
ensign
and
looked
then
he
put
it
back
quietly
and
the
second
mate
explained
all
that
we
knew
in
a
few
words
would
you
leave
him
where
he
is
sir
he
asked
after
he
had
told
everything
the
night
fine
said
the
captain
you
may
as
well
leave
the
poor
devil
there
he
turned
and
went
aft
slowly
the
man
who
was
holding
the
light
swept
it
round
so
that
it
showed
the
place
where
williams
had
struck
the
deck
the
second
mate
spoke
abruptly
get
a
broom
and
a
couple
of
buckets
some
of
you
he
turned
sharply
and
ordered
tammy
on
to
the
poop
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
the
yard
and
the
ropes
cleared
up
he
followed
tammy
he
knew
well
enough
that
it
would
not
do
for
the
youngster
to
let
his
mind
dwell
too
much
on
the
poor
chap
on
the
hatch
and
i
found
out
a
little
later
that
he
gave
the
boy
something
to
occupy
his
thoughts
after
they
had
gone
aft
we
went
into
the
every
one
was
moody
and
frightened
for
a
little
while
we
sat
about
in
our
bunks
and
on
the
chests
and
no
one
said
a
word
the
watch
below
were
all
asleep
and
not
one
of
them
knew
what
had
happened
all
at
once
plummer
whose
wheel
it
was
stepped
over
the
starboard
washboard
into
the
what
up
anyway
he
asked
is
williams
much
sh
i
said
you
wake
the
others
who
taken
your
wheel
tammy
ther
second
sent
said
i
could
go
forrard
an
er
smoke
said
williams
er
fall
he
broke
off
and
looked
across
the
where
is
he
inquired
in
a
puzzled
voice
i
glanced
at
the
others
but
no
one
seemed
inclined
to
start
yarning
about
it
he
fell
from
the
rigging
i
said
where
is
he
repeated
smashed
up
i
said
he
lying
on
the
hatch
dead
he
asked
i
nodded
i
guessed
somethin
pretty
bad
when
i
saw
the
old
man
come
forrard
did
it
he
looked
round
at
the
lot
of
us
sitting
there
silent
and
smoking
no
one
knows
i
said
and
glanced
at
stubbins
i
caught
him
eyeing
me
doubtfully
after
a
moment
silence
plummer
spoke
again
i
screech
when
i
was
at
ther
wheel
must
got
up
aloft
stubbins
struck
a
match
and
proceeded
to
relight
his
pipe
how
mean
he
asked
speaking
for
the
first
time
do
i
mean
well
i
ca
say
maybe
jammed
fingers
between
ther
parrel
an
ther
mast
what
about
swearin
at
ther
second
mate
was
that
jammed
fingers
put
in
quoin
i
never
about
that
said
plummer
i
should
think
heverybody
in
ther
bloomin
ship
heard
him
stubbins
answered
all
ther
same
i
hai
sure
he
swearin
at
ther
second
mate
i
thought
at
first
he
gone
dotty
an
was
cussin
him
but
somehow
it
do
seem
likely
now
i
come
to
think
it
do
stand
to
reason
he
should
go
to
cuss
ther
man
there
was
nothin
to
go
about
what
more
he
did
seem
ter
be
talkin
down
to
us
on
deck
what
i
could
make
hout
what
would
he
want
ter
go
talkin
to
ther
second
about
his
he
looked
across
to
where
i
was
sitting
jock
who
was
smoking
quietly
on
the
chest
next
to
me
took
his
pipe
slowly
out
from
between
his
teeth
ye
no
far
oot
stubbins
i
thinkin
ye
no
far
oot
he
said
nodding
his
head
stubbins
still
continued
to
gaze
at
me
what
your
idee
he
said
abruptly
it
may
have
been
my
fancy
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
something
deeper
than
the
mere
sense
the
question
conveyed
i
glanced
at
him
i
could
have
said
myself
just
what
my
idea
was
i
do
know
i
answered
a
little
adrift
he
did
strike
me
as
cursing
at
the
second
mate
that
is
i
should
say
after
the
first
minute
just
what
i
say
he
replied
another
thing
do
it
strike
you
as
bein
bloomin
queer
about
tom
nearly
comin
down
by
ther
run
an
then
i
nodded
it
would
have
been
all
hup
with
tom
if
it
had
been
for
ther
gasket
he
paused
after
a
moment
he
went
on
again
that
was
honly
three
or
four
nights
ago
well
said
plummer
what
are
yer
drivin
at
nothin
answered
stubbins
honly
it
damned
queer
looks
as
though
ther
ship
might
be
unlucky
after
all
well
agreed
plummer
things

a
bit
funny
lately
and
then
there
what
i
shall
on
pretty
tight
ther
next
time
i
go
aloft
old
jaskett
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
sighed
things
is
going
wrong
every
night
he
said
almost
pathetically
it
as
as
chalk
cheese
ter
what
it
were
we
started
this
trip
i
thought
it
were
all
rot
about
but
it
not
he
stopped
and
expectorated
she
hai
haunted
said
stubbins
leastways
not
like
you
mean
he
paused
as
though
trying
to
grasp
some
elusive
thought
eh
said
jaskett
in
the
interval
stubbins
continued
without
noticing
the
query
he
appeared
to
be
answering
some
thought
in
his
own
brain
rather
than
jaskett
things
is
queer
an
it
been
a
bad
job
tonight
i
do
savvy
one
bit
what
williams
was
sayin
of
hup
aloft
i
thought
sometimes
somethin
on
mind
then
after
a
pause
of
about
half
a
minute
he
said
this
was
he
sayin
that
to
eh
said
jaskett
again
with
a
puzzled
expression
i
was
thinkin
said
stubbins
knocking
out
his
pipe
on
the
edge
of
the
chest
you
right
hafter
all
vi
man
to
the
the
conversation
had
slacked
off
we
were
all
moody
and
shaken
and
i
know
i
for
one
was
thinking
some
rather
troublesome
thoughts
suddenly
i
heard
the
sound
of
the
second
whistle
then
his
voice
came
along
the
deck
another
man
to
the
wheel
singin
out
for
some
one
to
go
aft
an
relieve
ther
wheel
said
quoin
who
had
gone
to
the
door
to
listen
yer
better
up
plummer
what
ther
time
asked
plummer
standing
up
and
knocking
out
his
pipe
must
be
close
on
ter
four
bells
next
wheel
is
it
it
all
right
plummer
i
said
getting
up
from
the
chest
on
which
i
had
been
sitting
i
go
along
it
my
wheel
and
it
only
wants
a
couple
of
minutes
to
four
bells
plummer
sat
down
again
and
i
went
out
of
the
reaching
the
poop
i
met
tammy
on
the
lee
side
pacing
up
and
down
who
at
the
wheel
i
asked
him
in
astonishment
the
second
mate
he
said
in
a
shaky
sort
of
voice
he
waiting
to
be
relieved
i
tell
you
all
about
it
as
soon
as
i
get
a
chance
i
went
on
aft
to
the
wheel
who
that
the
second
inquired
it
jessop
sir
i
answered
he
gave
me
the
course
and
then
without
another
word
went
forrard
along
the
poop
on
the
break
i
heard
him
call
tammy
name
and
then
for
some
minutes
he
was
talking
to
him
though
what
he
was
saying
i
could
not
possibly
hear
for
my
part
i
was
tremendously
curious
to
know
why
the
second
mate
had
taken
the
wheel
i
knew
that
if
it
were
just
a
matter
of
bad
steering
on
tammy
part
he
would
not
have
dreamt
of
doing
such
a
thing
there
had
been
something
queer
happening
about
which
i
had
yet
to
learn
of
this
i
felt
sure
presently
the
second
mate
left
tammy
and
commenced
to
walk
the
weather
side
of
the
deck
once
he
came
right
aft
and
stooping
down
peered
under
the
but
never
addressed
a
word
to
me
sometime
later
he
went
down
the
weather
ladder
on
to
the
directly
afterwards
tammy
came
running
up
to
the
lee
side
of
the
i
seen
it
again
he
said
gasping
with
sheer
nervousness
what
i
said
that
he
answered
then
he
leant
across
the
and
lowered
his
voice
it
came
over
the
lee
rail
out
of
the
he
added
with
an
air
of
telling
something
unbelievable
i
turned
more
towards
him
but
it
was
too
dark
to
see
his
face
with
any
distinctness
i
felt
suddenly
husky
my
god
i
thought
and
then
i
made
a
silly
effort
to
protest
but
he
cut
me
short
with
a
certain
impatient
hopelessness
for
god
sake
jessop
he
said
do
stow
all
that
it
no
good
i
must
have
someone
to
talk
to
or
i
shall
go
dotty
i
saw
how
useless
it
was
to
pretend
any
sort
of
ignorance
indeed
really
i
had
known
it
all
along
and
avoided
the
youngster
on
that
very
account
as
you
know
go
on
i
said
i
listen
but
you
better
keep
an
eye
for
the
second
mate
he
may
pop
up
any
minute
for
a
moment
he
said
nothing
and
i
saw
him
peering
stealthily
about
the
poop
go
on
i
said
you
better
make
haste
or
he
be
up
before
through
what
was
he
doing
at
the
wheel
when
i
came
up
to
relieve
it
why
did
he
send
you
away
from
it
he
did
tammy
replied
turning
his
face
towards
me
i
bunked
away
from
it
what
for
i
asked
wait
a
minute
he
answered
and
i
tell
you
the
whole
business
you
know
the
second
mate
sent
me
to
the
wheel
after
he
nodded
his
head
forrard
yes
i
said
well
i
been
here
about
ten
minutes
or
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
i
was
feeling
rotten
about
williams
and
trying
to
forget
it
all
and
keep
the
ship
on
her
course
and
all
that
when
all
at
once
i
happened
to
glance
to
and
there
i
saw
it
climbing
over
the
rail
my
god
i
did
know
what
to
do
the
second
mate
was
standing
forrard
on
the
break
of
the
poop
and
i
was
here
all
by
myself
i
felt
as
if
i
were
frozen
stiff
when
it
came
towards
me
i
let
go
of
the
wheel
and
yelled
and
bunked
forrard
to
the
second
mate
he
caught
hold
of
me
and
shook
me
but
i
was
so
jolly
frightened
i
could
say
a
word
i
could
only
keep
on
pointing
the
second
kept
asking
me
and
then
all
at
once
i
found
i
could
see
the
thing
i
do
know
whether
he
saw
it
i
not
at
all
certain
he
did
he
just
told
me
to
damn
well
get
back
to
the
wheel
and
stop
making
a
damned
fool
of
myself
i
said
out
straight
i
would
go
so
he
blew
his
whistle
and
sung
out
for
someone
to
come
aft
and
take
it
then
he
ran
and
got
hold
of
the
wheel
himself
you
know
the
rest
you
quite
sure
it
was
thinking
about
williams
made
you
imagine
you
saw
something
i
said
more
to
gain
a
moment
to
think
than
because
i
believed
that
it
was
the
case
i
thought
you
were
going
to
listen
to
me
seriously
he
said
bitterly
if
you
wo
believe
me
what
about
the
chap
the
second
mate
saw
what
about
tom
what
about
williams
for
goodness
sake
do
try
to
put
me
off
like
you
did
last
time
i
nearly
went
cracked
with
wanting
to
tell
someone
who
would
listen
to
me
and
would
laugh
i
could
stand
anything
but
this
being
alone
there
a
good
chap
do
pretend
you
do
understand
tell
me
what
it
all
means
what
is
this
horrible
man
that
i
twice
seen
you
know
you
know
something
and
i
believe
you
afraid
to
tell
anyone
for
fear
of
being
laughed
at
why
you
tell
me
you
need
be
afraid
of
my
laughing
he
stopped
suddenly
for
the
moment
i
said
nothing
in
reply
do
treat
me
like
a
kid
jessop
he
exclaimed
quite
passionately
i
wo
i
said
with
a
sudden
resolve
to
tell
him
everything
i
need
someone
to
talk
to
just
as
badly
as
you
do
what
does
it
all
mean
then
he
burst
out
are
they
real
i
always
used
to
think
it
was
all
a
yarn
about
such
things
i
sure
i
do
know
what
it
all
means
tammy
i
answered
i
just
as
much
in
the
dark
there
as
you
are
and
i
do
know
whether
real
that
is
not
as
we
consider
things
real
you
do
know
that
i
saw
a
queer
figure
down
on
the
maindeck
several
nights
before
you
saw
that
thing
up
here
did
you
see
this
one
he
cut
in
quickly
yes
i
answered
then
why
did
you
pretend
not
to
have
he
said
in
a
reproachful
voice
you
do
know
what
a
state
you
put
me
into
what
with
my
being
certain
that
i
had
seen
it
and
then
you
being
so
jolly
positive
that
there
had
been
nothing
at
one
time
i
thought
i
was
going
clean
off
my
dot
until
the
second
mate
saw
that
man
go
up
the
main
then
i
knew
that
there
must
be
something
in
the
thing
i
was
certain
i
seen
i
thought
perhaps
that
if
i
told
you
i
had
seen
it
you
would
think
you
been
mistaken
i
said
i
wanted
you
to
think
it
was
imagination
or
a
dream
or
something
of
that
sort
and
all
the
time
you
knew
about
that
other
thing
you
seen
he
asked
yes
i
replied
it
was
thundering
decent
of
you
he
said
but
it
was
any
good
he
paused
a
moment
then
he
went
on
it
terrible
about
williams
do
you
think
he
saw
something
up
aloft
i
do
know
tammy
i
said
it
impossible
to
say
it
have
been
only
an
accident
i
hesitated
to
tell
him
what
i
really
thought
what
was
he
saying
about
his
who
was
he
saying
it
to
i
do
know
i
said
again
he
was
always
cracked
about
taking
a
out
of
her
you
know
he
stayed
in
her
on
purpose
when
all
the
others
left
he
told
me
that
he
was
going
to
be
done
out
of
it
for
anyone
what
did
the
other
lot
leave
for
he
asked
then
as
the
idea
seemed
to
strike
him
jove
do
you
think
they
saw
something
and
got
scared
it
quite
possible
you
know
we
only
joined
her
in
she
had
no
on
the
passage
out
our
ship
was
sold
so
they
sent
us
aboard
here
to
come
home
they
may
have
i
said
indeed
from
things
i
heard
williams
say
i
pretty
certain
he
for
one
guessed
or
knew
a
jolly
sight
more
than
we
any
idea
of
and
now
he
dead
said
tammy
solemnly
we
never
be
able
to
find
out
from
him
now
for
a
few
moments
he
was
silent
then
he
went
off
on
another
track
does
anything
ever
happen
in
the
mate
watch
yes
i
answered
there
several
things
happened
lately
that
seem
pretty
queer
some
of
his
side
have
been
talking
about
them
but
too
jolly
to
see
anything
he
just
curses
his
chaps
and
puts
it
all
down
to
them
still
he
persisted
things
seem
to
happen
more
in
our
watch
than
in
his
i
mean
bigger
things
look
at
tonight
we
no
proof
you
know
i
said
he
shook
his
head
doubtfully
i
shall
always
funk
going
aloft
now
nonsense
i
told
him
it
may
only
have
been
an
accident
do
he
said
you
know
you
do
think
so
really
i
answered
nothing
just
then
for
i
knew
very
well
that
he
was
right
we
were
silent
for
a
couple
of
moments
then
he
spoke
again
is
the
ship
haunted
for
an
instant
i
hesitated
no
i
said
at
length
i
do
think
she
is
i
mean
not
in
that
way
what
way
then
well
i
formed
a
bit
of
a
theory
that
seems
wise
one
minute
and
cracked
the
next
of
course
it
as
likely
to
be
all
wrong
but
the
only
thing
that
seems
to
me
to
fit
in
with
all
the
beastly
things
we
had
lately
go
on
he
said
with
an
impatient
nervous
movement
well
i
an
idea
that
it
nothing
the
ship
that
likely
to
hurt
us
i
scarcely
know
how
to
put
it
but
if
i
right
in
what
i
think
it
the
ship
herself
that
the
cause
of
everything
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
in
a
puzzled
voice
do
you
mean
that
the
ship
haunted
after
all
no
i
answered
i
just
told
you
i
did
wait
until
i
finished
what
i
was
going
to
say
all
right
he
said
about
that
thing
you
saw
tonight
i
went
on
you
say
it
came
over
the
lee
rail
up
on
to
the
poop
yes
he
answered
well
the
thing
i
saw
up
out
of
the
sea
and
went
back
into
the
jove
he
said
and
then
yes
go
on
my
idea
is
that
this
ship
is
open
to
be
boarded
by
those
things
i
explained
what
they
are
of
course
i
do
know
they
look
like
men
in
lots
of
ways
but
well
the
lord
knows
what
in
the
sea
though
we
do
want
to
go
imagining
silly
things
of
course
and
then
again
you
know
it
seems
calling
anything
silly
that
how
i
keep
going
in
a
sort
of
blessed
circle
i
do
know
a
bit
whether
flesh
and
blood
or
whether
they
what
we
should
call
ghosts
or
spirits
they
ca
be
flesh
and
blood
tammy
interrupted
where
would
they
live
besides
that
first
one
i
saw
i
thought
i
could
see
through
it
and
this
last
one
the
second
mate
would
have
seen
it
and
they
would
drown
not
necessarily
i
said
oh
but
i
sure
they
not
he
insisted
it
impossible
so
are
ghosts
when
you
feeling
sensible
i
answered
but
i
not
saying
they
flesh
and
blood
though
at
the
same
time
i
not
going
to
say
straight
out
they
ghosts
not
yet
at
any
rate
where
do
they
come
from
he
asked
stupidly
enough
out
of
the
sea
i
told
him
you
saw
for
yourself
then
why
do
other
vessels
have
them
coming
aboard
he
said
how
do
you
account
for
that
in
a
way
though
sometimes
it
seems
cracky
i
think
i
can
according
to
my
idea
i
answered
how
he
inquired
again
why
i
believe
that
this
ship
is
open
as
i
told
you
exposed
unprotected
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
i
should
say
reasonable
to
think
that
all
the
things
of
the
material
world
are
barred
as
it
were
from
the
immaterial
but
that
in
some
cases
the
barrier
may
be
broken
down
that
what
may
have
happened
to
this
ship
and
if
it
has
she
may
be
naked
to
the
attacks
of
beings
belonging
to
some
other
state
of
existence
what
made
her
like
that
he
asked
in
a
really
awed
sort
of
tone
the
lord
knows
i
answered
perhaps
something
to
do
with
magnetic
stresses
but
you
not
understand
and
i
do
really
and
i
suppose
inside
of
me
i
do
believe
it
anything
of
the
kind
for
a
minute
i
not
built
that
way
and
yet
i
do
know
perhaps
there
may
have
been
some
rotten
thing
done
aboard
of
her
or
again
it
a
heap
more
likely
to
be
something
quite
outside
of
anything
i
know
if
they
immaterial
then
they
spirits
he
questioned
i
do
know
i
said
it
so
hard
to
say
what
i
really
think
you
know
i
got
a
queer
idea
that
my
likes
to
think
good
but
i
do
believe
my
tummy
believes
it
go
on
he
said
well
i
said
suppose
the
earth
were
inhabited
by
two
kinds
of
life
we
one
and
the
other
go
on
he
said
well
i
said
do
you
see
in
a
normal
state
we
may
not
be
capable
of
appreciating
the
of
the
other
but
they
may
be
just
as
and
material
to
as
are
to
do
you
see
yes
he
said
go
on
well
i
said
the
earth
may
be
just
as
to
them
as
to
us
i
mean
that
it
may
have
qualities
as
material
to
them
as
it
has
to
us
but
neither
of
us
could
appreciate
the
other
realness
or
the
quality
of
realness
in
the
earth
which
was
real
to
the
other
it
so
difficult
to
explain
do
you
understand
yes
he
said
go
on
well
if
we
were
in
what
i
might
call
a
healthy
atmosphere
they
would
be
quite
beyond
our
power
to
see
or
feel
or
anything
and
the
same
with
them
but
the
more
we
like
the
more
and
actual
they
could
grow
see
that
is
the
more
we
should
become
able
to
appreciate
their
form
of
materialness
that
all
i
ca
make
it
any
clearer
then
after
all
you
think
they
ghosts
or
something
of
that
sort
tammy
said
i
suppose
it
does
come
to
that
i
answered
i
mean
that
anyway
i
do
think
they
our
ideas
of
flesh
and
blood
but
of
course
silly
to
say
much
and
after
all
you
must
remember
that
i
may
be
all
wrong
i
think
you
ought
to
tell
the
second
mate
all
this
he
said
if
really
as
you
say
the
ship
ought
to
be
put
into
the
nearest
port
and
jolly
well
burnt
the
second
mate
could
do
anything
i
replied
even
if
he
believed
it
all
which
we
not
certain
he
would
perhaps
not
tammy
answered
but
if
you
could
get
him
to
believe
it
he
might
explain
the
whole
business
to
the
skipper
and
then
something
might
be
done
it
not
safe
as
it
is
he
only
get
jeered
at
again
i
said
rather
hopelessly
no
said
tammy
not
after
what
happened
tonight
perhaps
not
i
replied
doubtfully
and
just
then
the
second
mate
came
back
on
to
the
poop
and
tammy
cleared
away
from
the
leaving
me
with
a
worrying
feeling
that
i
ought
to
do
something
vii
coming
of
the
mist
and
that
which
it
we
buried
williams
at
midday
poor
beggar
it
had
been
so
sudden
all
day
the
men
were
awed
and
gloomy
and
there
was
a
lot
of
talk
about
there
being
a
jonah
aboard
if
they
only
known
what
tammy
and
i
and
perhaps
the
second
mate
knew
and
then
the
next
thing
came
the
mist
i
can
not
remember
now
whether
it
was
on
the
day
we
buried
williams
that
we
first
saw
it
or
the
day
after
when
first
i
noticed
it
like
everybody
else
aboard
i
took
it
to
be
some
form
of
haze
due
to
the
heat
of
the
sun
for
it
was
broad
daylight
when
the
thing
came
the
wind
had
died
away
to
a
light
breeze
and
i
was
working
at
the
main
rigging
along
with
plummer
putting
on
seizings
looks
as
if
middlin
he
remarked
yes
i
said
and
for
the
time
took
no
further
notice
presently
he
spoke
again
it
gettin
quite
and
his
tone
showed
he
was
surprised
i
glanced
up
quickly
at
first
i
could
see
nothing
then
i
saw
what
he
meant
the
air
had
a
wavy
strange
unnatural
appearance
something
like
the
heated
air
over
the
top
of
an
engine
funnel
that
you
can
often
see
when
no
smoke
is
coming
out
must
be
the
heat
i
said
though
i
do
remember
ever
seeing
anything
just
like
it
before
nor
me
plummer
agreed
it
could
not
have
been
a
minute
later
when
i
looked
up
again
and
was
astonished
to
find
that
the
whole
ship
was
surrounded
by
a
thinnish
haze
that
quite
hid
the
horizon
by
jove
plummer
i
said
how
queer
yes
he
said
looking
round
i
never
seen
anythin
like
it
before
not
in
these
parts
heat
would
do
that
i
said
n
no
he
said
doubtfully
we
went
on
with
our
work
again
occasionally
exchanging
an
odd
word
or
two
presently
after
a
little
time
of
silence
i
bent
forward
and
asked
him
to
pass
me
up
the
spike
he
stooped
and
picked
it
up
from
the
deck
where
it
had
tumbled
as
he
held
it
out
to
me
i
saw
the
stolid
expression
on
his
face
change
suddenly
to
a
look
of
complete
surprise
he
opened
his
mouth
by
gum
he
said
it
gone
i
turned
quickly
and
looked
and
so
it
had
the
whole
sea
showing
clear
and
bright
right
away
to
the
horizon
i
stared
at
plummer
and
he
stared
at
me
well
i
blowed
he
exclaimed
i
do
not
think
i
made
any
reply
for
i
had
a
sudden
queer
feeling
that
the
thing
was
not
right
and
then
in
a
minute
i
called
myself
an
ass
but
i
could
not
really
shake
off
the
feeling
i
had
another
good
look
at
the
sea
i
had
a
vague
idea
that
something
was
different
the
sea
looked
brighter
somehow
and
the
air
clearer
i
thought
and
i
missed
something
but
not
much
you
know
and
it
was
not
until
a
couple
of
days
later
that
i
knew
that
it
was
several
vessels
on
the
horizon
which
had
been
quite
in
sight
before
the
mist
and
now
were
gone
during
the
rest
of
the
watch
and
indeed
all
day
there
was
no
further
sign
of
anything
unusual
only
when
the
evening
came
in
the
second
it
was
i
saw
the
mist
rise
faintly
the
setting
sun
shining
through
it
dim
and
unreal
i
knew
then
as
a
certainty
that
it
was
not
caused
by
heat
and
that
was
the
beginning
of
it
the
next
day
i
kept
a
pretty
close
watch
during
all
my
time
on
deck
but
the
atmosphere
remained
clear
yet
i
heard
from
one
of
the
chaps
in
the
mate
watch
that
it
had
been
hazy
during
part
of
the
time
he
was
at
the
wheel
comin
an
goin
like
he
described
it
to
me
when
i
questioned
him
about
it
he
thought
it
might
be
heat
but
though
i
knew
otherwise
i
did
not
contradict
him
at
that
time
no
one
not
even
plummer
seemed
to
think
very
much
of
the
matter
and
when
i
mentioned
it
to
tammy
and
asked
him
whether
he
noticed
it
he
only
remarked
that
it
must
have
been
heat
or
else
the
sun
drawing
up
water
i
let
it
stay
at
that
for
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
suggesting
that
the
thing
had
more
to
it
then
on
the
following
day
something
happened
that
set
me
wondering
more
than
ever
and
showed
me
how
right
i
had
been
in
feeling
the
mist
to
be
something
unnatural
it
was
in
this
way
five
bells
in
the
eight
to
twelve
morning
watch
had
gone
i
was
at
the
wheel
the
sky
was
perfectly
clear
not
a
cloud
to
be
seen
even
on
the
horizon
it
was
hot
standing
at
the
wheel
for
there
was
scarcely
any
wind
and
i
was
feeling
drowsy
the
second
mate
was
down
on
the
maindeck
with
the
men
seeing
about
some
job
he
wanted
done
so
that
i
was
on
the
poop
alone
presently
with
the
heat
and
the
sun
beating
right
down
on
to
me
i
grew
thirsty
and
for
want
of
something
better
i
pulled
out
a
bit
of
plug
i
had
on
me
and
bit
off
a
chew
though
as
a
rule
it
is
not
a
habit
of
mine
after
a
little
naturally
enough
i
glanced
round
for
the
spittoon
but
discovered
that
it
was
not
there
probably
it
had
been
taken
forrard
when
the
decks
were
washed
to
give
it
a
scrub
so
as
there
was
no
one
on
the
poop
i
left
the
wheel
and
stepped
aft
to
the
taffrail
it
was
thus
that
i
came
to
see
something
altogether
unthought
of
a
ship
on
the
port
tack
a
few
hundred
yards
on
our
starboard
quarter
her
sails
were
scarcely
filled
by
the
light
breeze
and
flapped
as
she
lifted
to
the
swell
of
the
sea
she
appeared
to
have
very
little
way
through
the
water
certainly
not
more
than
a
knot
an
hour
away
aft
hanging
from
the
was
a
string
of
flags
evidently
she
was
signalling
to
us
all
this
i
saw
in
a
flash
and
i
just
stood
and
stared
astonished
i
was
astonished
because
i
had
not
seen
her
earlier
in
that
light
breeze
i
knew
that
she
must
have
been
in
sight
for
at
least
a
couple
of
hours
yet
i
could
think
of
nothing
rational
to
satisfy
my
wonder
there
she
was
of
that
much
i
was
certain
and
yet
how
had
she
come
there
without
my
seeing
her
before
all
at
once
as
i
stood
staring
i
heard
the
wheel
behind
me
spin
rapidly
instinctively
i
jumped
to
get
hold
of
the
spokes
for
i
did
not
want
the
steering
gear
jammed
then
i
turned
again
to
have
another
look
at
the
other
ship
but
to
my
utter
bewilderment
was
no
sign
of
nothing
but
the
calm
ocean
spreading
away
to
the
distant
horizon
i
blinked
my
eyelids
a
bit
and
pushed
the
hair
off
my
forehead
then
i
stared
again
but
there
was
no
vestige
of
her
nothing
you
know
and
absolutely
nothing
unusual
except
a
faint
tremulous
quiver
in
the
air
and
the
blank
surface
of
the
sea
reaching
everywhere
to
the
empty
horizon
had
she
foundered
i
asked
myself
naturally
enough
and
for
the
moment
i
really
wondered
i
searched
round
the
sea
for
wreckage
but
there
was
nothing
not
even
an
odd
or
a
piece
of
deck
furniture
and
so
i
threw
away
that
idea
as
impossible
then
as
i
stood
i
got
another
thought
or
perhaps
an
intuition
and
i
asked
myself
seriously
whether
this
disappearing
ship
might
not
be
in
some
way
connected
with
the
other
queer
things
it
occurred
to
me
then
that
the
vessel
i
had
seen
was
nothing
real
and
perhaps
did
not
exist
outside
of
my
own
brain
i
considered
the
idea
gravely
it
helped
to
explain
the
thing
and
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
that
would
had
she
been
real
i
felt
sure
that
others
aboard
us
would
have
been
bound
to
have
seen
her
long
before
i
had
i
got
a
bit
muddled
there
with
trying
to
think
it
out
and
then
abruptly
the
reality
of
the
other
ship
came
back
to
me
every
rope
and
sail
and
spar
you
know
and
i
remembered
how
she
had
lifted
to
the
heave
of
the
sea
and
how
the
sails
had
flapped
in
the
light
breeze
and
the
string
of
flags
she
had
been
signalling
at
that
last
i
found
it
just
as
impossible
to
believe
that
she
had
not
been
real
i
had
reached
to
this
point
of
irresolution
and
was
standing
with
my
back
partly
turned
to
the
wheel
i
was
holding
it
steady
with
my
left
hand
while
i
looked
over
the
sea
to
try
to
find
something
to
help
me
to
understand
all
at
once
as
i
stared
i
seemed
to
see
the
ship
again
she
was
more
on
the
beam
now
than
on
the
quarter
but
i
thought
little
of
that
in
the
astonishment
of
seeing
her
once
more
it
was
only
a
glimpse
i
caught
of
her
dim
and
wavering
as
though
i
looked
at
her
through
the
convolutions
of
heated
air
then
she
grew
indistinct
and
vanished
again
but
i
was
convinced
now
that
she
was
real
and
had
been
in
sight
all
the
time
if
i
could
have
seen
her
that
curious
dim
wavering
appearance
had
suggested
something
to
me
i
remembered
the
strange
wavy
look
of
the
air
a
few
days
previously
just
before
the
mist
had
surrounded
the
ship
and
in
my
mind
i
connected
the
two
it
was
nothing
about
the
other
packet
that
was
strange
the
strangeness
was
with
us
it
was
something
that
was
about
or
invested
our
ship
that
prevented
me
or
indeed
any
one
else
aboard
from
seeing
that
other
it
was
evident
that
she
had
been
able
to
see
us
as
was
proved
by
her
signalling
in
an
irrelevant
sort
of
way
i
wondered
what
the
people
aboard
of
her
thought
of
our
apparently
intentional
disregard
of
their
signals
after
that
i
thought
of
the
strangeness
of
it
all
even
at
that
minute
they
could
see
us
plainly
and
yet
so
far
as
we
were
concerned
the
whole
ocean
seemed
empty
it
appeared
to
me
at
that
time
to
be
the
weirdest
thing
that
could
happen
to
us
and
then
a
fresh
thought
came
to
me
how
long
had
we
been
like
that
i
puzzled
for
a
few
moments
it
was
now
that
i
recollected
that
we
had
sighted
several
vessels
on
the
morning
of
the
day
when
the
mist
appeared
and
since
then
we
had
seen
nothing
this
to
say
the
least
should
have
struck
me
as
queer
for
some
of
the
other
packets
were
homeward
bound
along
with
us
and
steering
the
same
course
consequently
with
the
weather
being
fine
and
the
wind
next
to
nothing
they
should
have
been
in
sight
all
the
time
this
reasoning
seemed
to
me
to
show
unmistakably
some
connection
between
the
coming
of
the
mist
and
our
inability
to
so
that
it
is
possible
we
had
been
in
that
extraordinary
state
of
blindness
for
nearly
three
days
in
my
mind
the
last
glimpse
of
that
ship
on
the
quarter
came
back
to
me
and
i
remember
a
curious
thought
got
me
that
i
had
looked
at
her
from
out
of
some
other
dimension
for
a
while
you
know
i
really
believed
the
mystery
of
the
idea
and
that
it
might
be
the
actual
truth
took
me
instead
of
my
realising
just
all
that
it
might
mean
it
seemed
so
exactly
to
express
all
the
thoughts
that
had
come
since
seeing
that
other
packet
on
the
quarter
suddenly
behind
me
there
came
a
rustle
and
rattle
of
the
sails
and
in
the
same
instant
i
heard
the
skipper
saying
where
the
devil
have
you
got
her
to
jessop
i
whirled
round
to
the
wheel
i
do
know
sir
i
faltered
i
had
forgotten
even
that
i
was
at
the
wheel
do
know
he
shouted
i
should
damned
well
think
you
do
starboard
your
helm
you
fool
you
have
us
all
aback
i
i
sir
i
answered
and
hove
the
wheel
over
i
did
it
almost
mechanically
for
i
was
still
dazed
and
had
not
yet
had
time
to
collect
my
senses
during
the
following
i
was
only
conscious
in
a
confused
sort
of
way
that
the
old
man
was
ranting
at
me
this
feeling
of
bewilderment
passed
off
and
i
found
that
i
was
peering
blankly
into
the
binnacle
at
the
yet
until
then
entirely
without
being
aware
of
the
fact
now
however
i
saw
that
the
ship
was
coming
back
on
to
her
course
goodness
knows
how
much
she
had
been
off
with
the
realisation
that
i
had
let
the
ship
get
almost
aback
there
came
a
sudden
memory
of
the
alteration
in
the
position
of
the
other
vessel
she
had
appeared
last
on
the
beam
instead
of
on
the
quarter
now
however
as
my
brain
began
to
work
i
saw
the
cause
of
this
apparent
and
until
then
inexplicable
change
it
was
due
of
course
to
our
having
come
up
until
we
had
brought
the
other
packet
on
to
the
beam
it
is
curious
how
all
this
flashed
through
my
mind
and
held
my
attention
although
only
momentarily
in
the
face
of
the
storming
i
think
i
had
hardly
realised
he
was
still
singing
out
at
me
anyhow
the
next
thing
i
remember
he
was
shaking
my
arm
what
the
matter
with
you
man
he
was
shouting
and
i
just
stared
into
his
face
like
an
ass
without
saying
a
word
i
seemed
still
incapable
you
know
of
actual
reasoning
speech
are
you
damned
well
off
your
head
he
went
on
shouting
are
you
a
lunatic
have
you
had
sunstroke
speak
you
gaping
idiot
i
tried
to
say
something
but
the
words
would
not
come
clearly
i
i
i
i
said
and
stopped
stupidly
i
was
all
right
really
but
i
was
so
bewildered
with
the
thing
i
had
found
out
and
in
a
way
i
seemed
almost
to
have
come
back
out
of
a
distance
you
know
you
a
lunatic
he
said
again
he
repeated
the
statement
several
times
as
if
it
were
the
only
thing
that
sufficiently
expressed
his
opinion
of
me
then
he
let
go
of
my
arm
and
stepped
back
a
couple
of
paces
i
not
a
lunatic
i
said
with
a
sudden
gasp
i
not
a
lunatic
sir
any
more
than
you
are
why
the
devil
do
you
answer
my
questions
then
he
shouted
angrily
what
the
matter
with
you
what
have
you
been
doing
with
the
ship
answer
me
now
i
was
looking
at
that
ship
away
on
the
starboard
quarter
sir
i
blurted
out
she
been
signalling
what
he
cut
me
short
with
disbelief
what
ship
he
turned
quickly
and
looked
over
the
quarter
then
he
wheeled
round
to
me
again
there
no
ship
what
do
you
mean
by
trying
to
spin
up
a
cuffer
like
that
there
is
sir
i
answered
it
out
there
i
pointed
hold
your
tongue
he
said
do
talk
rubbish
to
me
do
you
think
blind
i
saw
it
sir
i
persisted
do
you
talk
back
to
me
he
snapped
with
a
quick
burst
of
temper
i
wo
have
it
then
just
as
suddenly
he
was
silent
he
came
a
step
towards
me
and
stared
into
my
face
i
believe
the
old
ass
thought
i
was
a
bit
mad
anyway
without
another
word
he
went
to
the
break
of
the
poop
tulipson
he
sung
out
yes
sir
i
heard
the
second
mate
reply
send
another
man
to
the
wheel
very
good
sir
the
second
answered
a
couple
of
minutes
later
old
jaskett
came
up
to
relieve
me
i
gave
him
the
course
and
he
repeated
it
what
up
mate
he
asked
me
as
i
stepped
off
the
grating
nothing
much
i
said
and
went
forrard
to
where
the
skipper
was
standing
on
the
break
of
the
poop
i
gave
him
the
course
but
the
crabby
old
devil
took
no
notice
of
me
whatever
when
i
got
down
on
to
the
maindeck
i
went
up
to
the
second
and
gave
it
to
him
he
answered
me
civilly
enough
and
then
asked
me
what
i
had
been
doing
to
put
the
old
man
back
up
i
told
him
there
a
ship
on
the
starboard
quarter
signalling
us
i
said
there
no
ship
out
there
jessop
the
second
mate
replied
looking
at
me
with
a
queer
inscrutable
expression
there
is
sir
i
began
i
that
will
do
jessop
he
said
go
forrard
and
have
a
smoke
i
shall
want
you
then
to
give
a
hand
with
these
you
better
bring
a
aft
with
you
when
you
come
i
hesitated
a
moment
partly
in
anger
but
more
i
think
in
doubt
i
i
sir
i
muttered
at
length
and
went
forrard
viii
the
coming
of
the
after
the
coming
of
the
mist
things
seemed
to
develop
pretty
quickly
in
the
following
two
or
three
days
a
good
deal
happened
on
the
night
of
the
day
on
which
the
skipper
had
sent
me
away
from
the
wheel
it
was
our
watch
on
deck
from
eight
o
clock
to
twelve
and
my
from
ten
to
twelve
as
i
paced
slowly
to
and
fro
across
the
head
i
was
thinking
about
the
affair
of
the
morning
at
first
my
thoughts
were
about
the
old
man
i
cursed
him
thoroughly
to
myself
for
being
a
old
fool
until
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
i
had
been
in
his
place
and
come
on
deck
to
find
the
ship
almost
aback
and
the
fellow
at
the
wheel
staring
out
across
the
sea
instead
of
attending
to
his
business
i
should
most
certainly
have
kicked
up
a
thundering
row
and
then
i
had
been
an
ass
to
tell
him
about
the
ship
i
should
never
have
done
such
a
thing
if
i
had
not
been
a
bit
adrift
most
likely
the
old
chap
thought
i
was
cracked
i
ceased
to
bother
my
head
about
him
and
fell
to
wondering
why
the
second
mate
had
looked
at
me
so
queerly
in
the
morning
did
he
guess
more
of
the
truth
than
i
supposed
and
if
that
were
the
case
why
had
he
refused
to
listen
to
me
after
that
i
went
to
puzzling
about
the
mist
i
had
thought
a
great
deal
about
it
during
the
day
one
idea
appealed
to
me
very
strongly
it
was
that
the
actual
visible
mist
was
a
materialised
expression
of
an
extraordinarily
subtle
atmosphere
in
which
we
were
moving
abruptly
as
i
walked
backwards
and
forwards
taking
occasional
glances
over
the
sea
which
was
almost
calm
my
eye
caught
the
glow
of
a
light
out
in
the
darkness
i
stood
still
and
stared
i
wondered
whether
it
was
the
light
of
a
vessel
in
that
case
we
were
no
longer
enveloped
in
that
extraordinary
atmosphere
i
bent
forward
and
gave
the
thing
my
more
immediate
attention
i
saw
then
that
it
was
undoubtedly
the
green
light
of
a
vessel
on
our
port
bow
it
was
plain
that
she
was
bent
on
crossing
our
bows
what
was
more
she
was
dangerously
near
the
size
and
brightness
of
her
light
showed
that
she
would
be
while
we
were
going
free
so
that
of
course
it
was
our
place
to
get
out
of
her
way
instantly
i
turned
and
putting
my
hands
up
to
my
mouth
hailed
the
second
mate
light
on
the
port
bow
sir
the
next
moment
his
hail
came
back
whereabouts
he
must
be
blind
i
said
to
myself
about
two
points
on
the
bow
sir
i
sung
out
then
i
turned
to
see
whether
she
had
shifted
her
position
at
all
yet
when
i
came
to
look
there
was
no
light
visible
i
ran
forrard
to
the
bows
and
leant
over
the
rail
and
stared
but
there
was
nothing
absolutely
nothing
except
the
darkness
all
about
us
for
perhaps
a
few
seconds
i
stood
thus
and
a
suspicion
swept
across
me
that
the
whole
business
was
practically
a
repetition
of
the
affair
of
the
morning
evidently
the
impalpable
something
that
invested
the
ship
had
thinned
for
an
instant
thus
allowing
me
to
see
the
light
ahead
now
it
had
closed
again
yet
whether
i
could
see
or
not
i
did
not
doubt
the
fact
that
there
was
a
vessel
ahead
and
very
close
ahead
too
we
might
run
on
top
of
her
any
minute
my
only
hope
was
that
seeing
we
were
not
getting
out
of
her
way
she
had
put
her
helm
up
so
as
to
let
us
pass
with
the
intention
of
then
crossing
under
our
stern
i
waited
pretty
anxiously
watching
and
listening
then
all
at
once
i
heard
steps
coming
along
the
deck
forrard
and
the
whose
it
was
came
up
on
to
the
head
the
second
mate
says
he
ca
see
any
light
jessop
he
said
coming
over
to
where
i
stood
whereabouts
is
it
i
do
know
i
answered
i
lost
sight
of
it
myself
it
was
a
green
light
about
a
couple
of
points
on
the
port
bow
it
seemed
fairly
close
perhaps
their
lamp
gone
out
he
suggested
after
peering
out
pretty
hard
into
the
night
for
a
minute
or
so
perhaps
i
said
i
did
not
tell
him
that
the
light
had
been
so
close
that
even
in
the
darkness
we
should
have
been
able
to
see
the
ship
herself
you
quite
sure
it
was
a
light
and
not
a
star
he
asked
doubtfully
after
another
long
stare
oh
no
i
said
it
may
have
been
the
moon
now
i
come
to
think
about
it
do
rot
he
replied
it
easy
enough
to
make
a
mistake
what
shall
i
say
to
the
second
mate
tell
him
it
disappeared
of
course
where
to
he
asked
how
the
devil
should
i
know
i
told
him
do
ask
silly
questions
all
right
keep
your
rag
in
he
said
and
went
aft
to
report
to
the
second
mate
five
minutes
later
it
might
have
been
i
saw
the
light
again
it
was
broad
on
the
bow
and
told
me
plainly
enough
that
she
had
up
with
her
helm
to
escape
being
run
down
i
did
not
wait
a
moment
but
sung
out
to
the
second
mate
that
there
was
a
green
light
about
four
points
on
the
port
bow
by
jove
it
must
have
been
a
close
shave
the
light
did
not
to
be
more
than
about
a
hundred
yards
away
it
was
fortunate
that
we
had
not
much
way
through
the
water
now
i
thought
to
myself
the
second
will
see
the
thing
and
perhaps
blooming
will
be
able
to
give
the
star
its
proper
name
even
as
the
thought
came
into
my
head
the
light
faded
and
vanished
and
i
caught
the
second
mate
voice
whereaway
he
was
singing
out
it
gone
again
sir
i
answered
a
minute
later
i
heard
him
coming
along
the
deck
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
starboard
ladder
where
are
you
jessop
he
inquired
here
sir
i
said
and
went
to
the
top
of
the
weather
ladder
he
came
up
slowly
on
to
the
head
what
this
you
been
singing
out
about
a
light
he
asked
just
point
out
exactly
where
it
was
you
last
saw
it
this
i
did
and
he
went
over
to
the
port
rail
and
stared
away
into
the
night
but
without
seeing
anything
it
gone
sir
i
ventured
to
remind
him
though
i
seen
it
twice
now
once
about
a
couple
of
points
on
the
bow
and
this
last
time
broad
away
on
the
bow
but
it
disappeared
both
times
almost
at
once
i
do
understand
it
at
all
jessop
he
said
in
a
puzzled
voice
are
you
sure
it
was
a
ship
light
yes
sir
a
green
light
it
was
quite
close
i
do
understand
he
said
again
run
aft
and
ask
the
to
pass
you
down
my
night
glasses
be
as
smart
as
you
can
i
i
sir
i
replied
and
ran
aft
in
less
than
a
minute
i
was
back
with
his
binoculars
and
with
them
he
stared
for
some
time
at
the
sea
to
leeward
all
at
once
he
dropped
them
to
his
side
and
faced
round
on
me
with
a
sudden
question
where
she
gone
to
if
she
shifted
her
bearing
as
quickly
as
all
that
she
must
be
precious
close
we
should
be
able
to
see
her
spars
and
sails
or
her
cabin
light
or
her
binnacle
light
or
something
it
queer
sir
i
assented
damned
queer
he
said
so
damned
queer
that
i
inclined
to
think
you
made
a
mistake
no
sir
i
certain
it
was
a
light
where
the
ship
then
he
asked
i
ca
say
sir
that
just
what
been
puzzling
me
the
second
said
nothing
in
reply
but
took
a
couple
of
quick
turns
across
the
head
stopping
at
the
port
rail
and
taking
another
look
to
leeward
through
his
night
glasses
perhaps
a
minute
he
stood
there
then
without
a
word
he
went
down
the
lee
ladder
and
away
aft
along
the
main
deck
to
the
poop
he
jolly
well
puzzled
i
thought
to
myself
or
else
he
thinks
been
imagining
things
either
way
i
guessed
he
think
that
in
a
little
i
began
to
wonder
whether
after
all
he
had
any
idea
of
what
might
be
the
truth
one
minute
i
would
feel
certain
he
had
and
the
next
i
was
just
as
sure
that
he
guessed
nothing
i
got
one
of
my
fits
of
asking
myself
whether
it
would
not
have
been
better
to
have
told
him
everything
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
must
have
seen
sufficient
to
make
him
inclined
to
listen
to
me
and
yet
i
could
not
by
any
means
be
certain
i
might
only
have
been
making
an
ass
of
myself
in
his
eyes
or
set
him
thinking
i
was
dotty
i
was
walking
about
the
head
feeling
like
this
when
i
saw
the
light
for
the
third
time
it
was
very
bright
and
big
and
i
could
see
it
move
as
i
watched
this
again
showed
me
that
it
must
be
very
close
surely
i
thought
the
second
mate
must
see
it
now
for
himself
i
did
not
sing
out
this
time
right
away
i
thought
i
would
let
the
second
see
for
himself
that
i
had
not
been
mistaken
besides
i
was
not
going
to
risk
its
vanishing
again
the
instant
i
had
spoken
for
quite
half
a
minute
i
watched
it
and
there
was
no
sign
of
its
disappearing
every
moment
i
expected
to
hear
the
second
mate
hail
showing
that
he
had
spotted
it
at
last
but
none
came
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
i
ran
to
the
rail
on
the
after
part
of
the
head
green
light
a
little
abaft
the
beam
sir
i
sung
out
at
the
top
of
my
voice
but
i
had
waited
too
long
even
as
i
shouted
the
light
blurred
and
vanished
i
stamped
my
foot
and
swore
the
thing
was
making
a
fool
of
me
yet
i
had
a
faint
hope
that
those
aft
had
seen
it
just
before
it
disappeared
but
this
i
knew
was
vain
directly
i
heard
the
second
voice
light
be
damned
he
shouted
then
he
blew
his
whistle
and
one
of
the
men
ran
aft
out
of
the
to
see
what
it
was
he
wanted
whose
next
is
it
i
heard
him
ask
jaskett
sir
then
tell
jaskett
to
relieve
jessop
at
once
do
you
hear
yes
sir
said
the
man
and
came
forrard
in
a
minute
jaskett
stumbled
up
onto
the
head
what
up
mate
he
asked
sleepily
it
that
fool
of
a
second
mate
i
said
savagely
i
reported
a
light
to
him
three
times
and
because
the
blind
fool
ca
see
it
sent
you
up
to
relieve
me
where
is
it
mate
he
inquired
he
looked
round
at
the
dark
sea
i
do
see
no
light
he
remarked
after
a
few
moments
no
i
said
it
gone
eh
he
inquired
it
gone
i
repeated
irritably
he
turned
and
regarded
me
silently
through
the
dark
i
go
an
a
sleep
mate
he
said
at
length
i
been
that
way
meself
ther
nothin
like
a
snooze
yer
gets
like
that
what
i
said
like
what
it
all
right
mate
yer
be
all
right
in
ther
mornin
do
yer
worry
me
his
tone
was
sympathetic
hell
was
all
i
said
and
walked
down
off
the
head
i
wondered
whether
the
old
fellow
thought
i
was
going
silly
have
a
sleep
by
jove
i
muttered
to
myself
i
wonder
who
feel
like
having
a
sleep
after
what
i
seen
and
stood
today
i
felt
rotten
with
no
one
understanding
what
was
really
the
matter
i
seemed
to
be
all
alone
through
the
things
i
had
learnt
then
the
thought
came
to
me
to
go
aft
and
talk
the
matter
over
with
tammy
i
knew
he
would
be
able
to
understand
of
course
and
it
would
be
such
a
relief
on
the
impulse
i
turned
and
went
aft
along
the
deck
to
the
berth
as
i
neared
the
break
of
the
poop
i
looked
up
and
saw
the
dark
shape
of
the
second
mate
leaning
over
the
rail
above
me
who
that
he
asked
it
jessop
sir
i
said
what
do
you
want
in
this
part
of
the
ship
he
inquired
i
come
aft
to
speak
to
tammy
sir
i
replied
you
go
along
forrard
and
he
said
not
altogether
unkindly
a
sleep
will
do
you
more
good
than
yarning
about
you
know
you
getting
to
fancy
things
too
much
i
sure
i
not
sir
i
perfectly
well
i
that
will
do
he
interrupted
sharply
you
go
and
have
a
sleep
i
gave
a
short
curse
under
my
breath
and
went
slowly
forrard
i
was
getting
maddened
with
being
treated
as
if
i
were
not
quite
sane
by
god
i
said
to
myself
wait
till
the
fools
know
what
i
know
just
wait
i
entered
the
through
the
port
doorway
and
went
across
to
my
chest
and
sat
down
i
felt
angry
and
tired
and
miserable
quoin
and
plummer
were
sitting
close
by
playing
cards
and
smoking
stubbins
lay
in
his
bunk
watching
them
and
also
smoking
as
i
sat
down
he
put
his
head
forward
over
the
and
regarded
me
in
a
curious
meditative
way
what
hup
with
ther
second
hoffìcer
he
asked
after
a
short
stare
i
looked
at
him
and
the
other
two
men
looked
up
at
me
i
felt
i
should
go
off
with
a
bang
if
i
did
not
say
something
and
i
let
out
pretty
stiffly
telling
them
the
whole
business
yet
i
had
seen
enough
to
know
that
it
was
no
good
trying
to
explain
things
so
i
just
told
them
the
plain
bold
facts
and
left
explanations
as
much
alone
as
possible
three
times
you
say
said
stubbins
when
i
had
finished
yes
i
assented
an
ther
old
man
sent
yer
from
ther
wheel
this
mornin
yer
ter
see
a
ship
could
plummer
added
in
a
reflective
tone
yes
i
said
again
i
thought
i
saw
him
look
at
quoin
significantly
but
stubbins
i
noticed
looked
only
at
me
i
reckon
ther
second
thinks
you
a
bit
hoff
colour
he
remarked
after
a
short
pause
the
second
mate
a
fool
i
said
with
some
bitterness
a
confounded
fool
i
hai
so
sure
about
that
he
replied
it
bound
ter
seem
queer
ter
him
i
do
understand
it
myself
he
lapsed
into
silence
and
smoked
i
car
understand
it
is
ther
second
mate
did
to
spot
it
quoin
said
in
a
puzzled
voice
it
seemed
to
me
that
plummer
nudged
him
to
be
quiet
it
looked
as
if
plummer
shared
the
second
mate
opinion
and
the
idea
made
me
savage
but
stubbins
next
remark
drew
my
attention
i
do
hunderstand
it
he
said
again
speaking
with
deliberation
all
ther
same
ther
second
should
have
savvied
enough
not
to
have
slung
you
hoff
ther
he
nodded
his
head
slowly
keeping
his
gaze
fixed
on
my
face
how
do
you
mean
i
asked

with
a
vague
sense

the
man
understood
more
perhaps
than
i
had
hitherto

ther
second
so
blessed
cocksure
about

took
a
draw

over

asked

replied

told

was
getting
to
imagining
things
too
much
he
said

and
get
a
sleep
an
what

say
nothing
i
came

bloomin
well
harsk
him
if

ther
main
hafter
that
bogyman
of
his
i
never
thought
of
it
i
told
him
well

ought
ter
have
he
paused
and
sat
up
in
his
bunk
and
asked
for
a
match
as
i
passed
him
my
box
quoin
looked
up
from
his
game
it
might
been
a
stowaway
yer
know
yer
car
say
as
it
ever
been
proved
as
it
was
stubbins
passed
the
box
back
to
me
and
went
on
without
noticing
remark

go
an
have
a
snooze
did
he
i
do

nodded
his
head
sagely
it
my
hidea
he
knows

saw
that
light
just
as
bloomin
well
as
i
do
plummer
looked
up
from
his
game
at
this
speech
but
said
nothing
then
do
doubt
that
i
really
saw
it
i
asked
with
a
certain
surprise
not
me
he
remarked
with
assurance
you
hai
likely
ter
make
that
kind
of
mistake
three
times
runnin
no
i
said
i
i
saw
the
light
right
enough
but
i
hesitated
a
moment
it
blessed
queer
it
blessed
queer
he
agreed
it
damned
queer
an
there
a
lot
of
other
damn
queer
things
happenin
aboard
this
packet
lately
he
was
silent
for
a
few
seconds
then
he
spoke
suddenly
it
not
i
damned
sure
of
that
much
he
took
a
couple
of
draws
at
his
pipe
and
in
the
momentary
silence
i
caught
jaskett
voice
above
us
he
was
hailing
the
poop
red
light
on
the
starboard
quarter
sir
i
heard
him
sing
out
there
you
are
i
said
with
a
jerk
of
my
head
that
about
where
that
packet
i
spotted
ought
to
be
by
now
she
could
cross
our
bows
so
she
up
helm
and
let
us
pass
and
now
she
hauled
up
again
and
gone
under
our
stern
i
got
up
from
the
chest
and
went
to
the
door
the
other
three
following
as
we
stepped
out
on
deck
i
heard
the
second
mate
shouting
out
away
aft
to
know
the
whereabouts
of
the
light
by
jove
stubbins
i
said
i
believe
the
blessed
thing
gone
again
we
ran
to
the
starboard
side
in
a
body
and
looked
over
but
there
was
no
sign
of
a
light
in
the
darkness
astern
i
car
say
as
see
any
light
said
quoin
plummer
said
nothing
i
looked
up
at
the
head
there
i
could
faintly
distinguish
the
outlines
of
jaskett
he
was
standing
by
the
starboard
rail
with
his
hands
up
shading
his
eyes
evidently
staring
towards
the
place
where
he
had
last
seen
the
light
where
she
got
to
jaskett
i
called
out
i
ca
say
mate
he
answered
it
the
most
funny
thing
i
ever
comed
across
she
were
there
as
plain
as
me
one
minnit
an
ther
next
she
were
gone
clean
gone
i
turned
to
plummer
what
do
you
think
about
it
i
asked
him
well
he
said
i
admit
i
thought
at
first
somethin
nothin
i
thought
yer
was
mistaken
but
it
seems
yer
did
see
somethin
away
aft
we
heard
the
sound
of
steps
along
the
deck
ther
second
comin
forrard
for
a
hexplanation
jaskett
stubbins
sung
out
you
better
go
down
an
change
yer
breeks
the
second
mate
passed
us
and
went
up
the
starboard
ladder
what
up
now
jaskett
he
said
quickly
where
is
this
light
neither
the
nor
i
can
see
it
ther
damn
thing
clean
gone
sir
jaskett
replied
gone
the
second
mate
said
gone
what
do
you
mean

were
there
one
minnit
sir
as
plain
as
me
an
ther
next
she
gone
that
a
damn
silly
yarn
to
tell
me
the
second
replied
you
expect
me
to
believe
it
do
you
it
gospel
trewth
sir
jaskett
answered
an
jessop
seen
it
just
ther
same
he
seemed
to
have
added
that
last
part
as
an
afterthought
evidently
the
old
beggar
had
changed
his
opinion
as
to
my
need
for
sleep
you
an
old
fool
jaskett
the
second
said
sharply
and
that
idiot
jessop
has
been
putting
things
into
your
silly
old
head
he
paused
an
instant
then
he
continued
what
the
devil
the
matter
with
you
all
that
you
taken
to
this
sort
of
game
you
know
very
well
that
you
saw
no
light
i
sent
jessop
off
the
and
then
you
must
go
and
start
the
same
game
we
jaskett
started
to
say
but
the
second
silenced
him
stow
it
he
said
and
turned
and
went
down
the
ladder
passing
us
quickly
without
a
word
does
look
to
stubbins
i
said
as
though
the
second
did
believe
we
seen
the
light
i
hai
so
sure
he
answered
he
a
puzzler
the
rest
of
the
watch
passed
away
quietly
and
at
eight
bells
i
made
haste
to
for
i
was
tremendously
tired
when
we
were
called
again
for
the
four
to
eight
watch
on
deck
i
learnt
that
one
of
the
men
in
the
mate
watch
had
seen
a
light
soon
after
we
had
gone
below
and
had
reported
it
only
for
it
to
disappear
immediately
this
i
found
had
happened
twice
and
the
mate
had
got
so
wild
being
under
the
impression
that
the
man
was
playing
the
fool
that
he
had
nearly
came
to
blows
with
him
finally
ordering
him
off
the
and
sending
another
man
up
in
his
place
if
this
last
man
saw
the
light
he
took
good
care
not
to
let
the
mate
know
so
that
the
matter
had
ended
there
and
then
on
the
following
night
before
we
had
ceased
to
talk
about
the
matter
of
the
vanishing
lights
something
else
occurred
that
temporarily
drove
from
my
mind
all
memory
of
the
mist
and
the
extraordinary
blind
atmosphere
it
had
seemed
to
usher
ix
man
who
cried
for
it
was
as
i
have
said
on
the
following
night
that
something
further
happened
and
it
brought
home
pretty
vividly
to
me
if
not
to
any
of
the
others
the
sense
of
a
personal
danger
aboard
we
had
gone
below
for
the
eight
to
twelve
watch
and
my
last
impression
of
the
weather
at
eight
was
that
the
wind
was
freshening
there
had
been
a
great
bank
of
cloud
rising
astern
which
had
looked
as
if
it
were
going
to
breeze
up
still
more
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
when
we
were
called
for
our
twelve
to
four
watch
on
deck
i
could
tell
at
once
by
the
sound
that
there
was
a
fresh
breeze
blowing
at
the
same
time
i
heard
the
voices
of
the
men
on
the
other
watch
singing
out
as
they
hauled
on
the
ropes
i
caught
the
rattle
of
canvas
in
the
wind
and
guessed
that
they
were
taking
the
royals
off
her
i
looked
at
my
watch
which
i
always
kept
hanging
in
my
bunk
it
showed
the
time
to
be
just
after
the
quarter
so
that
with
luck
we
should
escape
having
to
go
up
to
the
sails
i
dressed
quickly
and
then
went
to
the
door
to
look
at
the
weather
i
found
that
the
wind
had
shifted
from
the
starboard
quarter
to
right
aft
and
by
the
look
of
the
sky
there
seemed
to
be
a
promise
of
more
before
long
up
aloft
i
could
make
out
faintly
the
fore
and
mizzen
royals
flapping
in
the
wind
the
main
had
been
left
for
a
while
longer
in
the
fore
riggings
jacobs
the
ordinary
seaman
in
the
mate
watch
was
following
another
of
the
men
aloft
to
the
sail
the
mate
two
were
already
up
at
the
mizzen
down
on
deck
the
rest
of
the
men
were
busy
clearing
up
the
ropes
i
went
back
to
my
bunk
and
looked
at
my
watch
the
time
was
only
a
few
minutes
off
eight
bells
so
i
got
my
oilskins
ready
for
it
looked
like
rain
outside
as
i
was
doing
this
jock
went
to
the
door
for
a
look
what
it
doin
jock
tom
asked
getting
out
of
his
bunk
hurriedly
i
thinkin
maybe
it
goin
to
blow
a
wee
and
ye
be
needin
oilskins
jock
answered
when
eight
bells
went
and
we
mustered
aft
for
there
was
a
considerable
delay
owing
to
the
mate
refusing
to
call
the
roll
until
tom
who
as
usual
had
only
turned
out
of
his
bunk
at
the
last
minute
came
aft
to
answer
his
name
when
at
last
he
did
come
the
second
and
the
mate
joined
in
giving
him
a
good
dressing
down
for
a
lazy
sojer
so
that
several
minutes
passed
before
we
were
on
our
way
forrard
again
this
was
a
small
enough
matter
in
itself
and
yet
really
terrible
in
its
consequence
to
one
of
our
number
for
just
as
we
reached
the
fore
rigging
there
was
a
shout
aloft
loud
above
the
noise
of
the
wind
and
the
next
moment
something
crashed
down
into
our
midst
with
a
great
slogging
thud
something
bulky
and
weighty
that
struck
full
upon
jock
so
that
he
went
down
with
a
loud
horrible
ringing
ugg
and
never
said
a
word
from
the
whole
crowd
of
us
there
went
up
a
yell
of
fear
and
then
with
one
accord
there
was
a
run
for
the
lighted
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
i
ran
with
the
rest
a
blind
unreasoning
fright
had
seized
me
and
i
did
not
stop
to
think
once
in
the
and
the
light
there
was
a
reaction
we
all
stood
and
looked
blankly
at
one
another
for
a
few
moments
then
someone
asked
a
question
and
there
was
a
general
murmur
of
denial
we
all
felt
ashamed
and
someone
reached
up
and
unhooked
the
lantern
on
the
port
side
i
did
the
same
with
the
starboard
one
and
there
was
a
quick
movement
towards
the
doors
as
we
streamed
out
on
deck
i
caught
the
sound
of
the
mates
voices
they
had
evidently
come
down
from
off
the
poop
to
find
out
what
had
happened
but
it
was
too
dark
to
see
their
whereabouts
where
the
hell
have
you
all
got
to
i
heard
the
mate
shout
the
next
instant
they
must
have
seen
the
light
from
our
lanterns
for
i
heard
their
footsteps
coming
along
the
deck
at
a
run
they
came
the
starboard
side
and
just
abaft
the
fore
rigging
one
of
them
stumbled
and
fell
over
something
it
was
the
first
mate
who
had
tripped
i
knew
this
by
the
cursing
that
came
directly
afterwards
he
picked
himself
up
and
apparently
without
stopping
to
see
what
manner
of
thing
it
was
that
he
had
fallen
over
made
a
rush
to
the
the
second
mate
ran
into
the
circle
of
light
thrown
by
our
lanterns
and
stopped
dead
eyeing
us
doubtfully
i
am
not
surprised
at
this
nor
at
the
behaviour
of
the
mate
the
following
instant
but
at
that
time
i
must
say
i
could
not
conceive
what
had
come
to
them
particularly
the
first
mate
he
came
out
at
us
from
the
darkness
with
a
rush
and
a
roar
like
a
bull
and
brandishing
a
i
had
failed
to
take
into
account
the
scene
which
his
eyes
must
have
shown
him
the
whole
crowd
of
men
in
the
both
watches
pouring
out
on
to
the
deck
in
utter
confusion
and
greatly
excited
with
a
couple
of
fellows
at
their
head
carrying
lanterns
and
before
this
there
had
been
the
cry
aloft
and
the
crash
down
on
deck
followed
by
the
shouts
of
the
frightened
crew
and
the
sounds
of
many
feet
running
he
may
well
have
taken
the
cry
for
a
signal
and
our
actions
for
something
not
far
short
of
mutiny
indeed
his
words
told
us
that
this
was
his
very
thought
i
knock
the
face
off
the
first
man
that
comes
a
step
further
aft
he
shouted
shaking
the
pin
in
my
face
i
show
yer
who
master
here
what
the
hell
do
yer
mean
by
this
get
forrard
into
yer
kennel
there
was
a
low
growl
from
the
men
at
the
last
remark
and
the
old
bully
stepped
back
a
couple
of
paces
hold
on
you
fellows
i
sung
out
shut
up
a
minute
mr
tulipson
i
called
out
to
the
second
who
had
not
been
able
to
get
a
word
in
edgeways
i
do
know
what
the
devil
the
matter
with
the
first
mate
but
he
not
find
it
pay
to
talk
to
a
crowd
like
ours
in
that
sort
of
fashion
or
there
be
ructions
aboard
come
come
jessop
this
wo
do
i
ca
have
you
talking
like
that
about
the
mate
he
said
sharply
let
me
know
what
and
then
go
forrard
again
the
lot
of
you
we
have
told
you
at
first
sir
i
said
only
the
mate
would
give
any
of
us
a
chance
to
speak
there
been
an
awful
accident
sir
something
fallen
from
aloft
right
on
to
jock
i
stopped
suddenly
for
there
was
a
loud
crying
aloft
help
help
help
someone
was
shouting
and
then
it
rose
from
a
shout
into
a
scream
my
god
sir
i
shouted
that
one
of
the
men
up
at
the
fore
royal
listen
ordered
the
second
mate
listen
even
as
he
spoke
it
came
again
broken
and
as
it
were
in
gasps
help
oh
god
oh
help
abruptly
stubbins
voice
struck
in
hup
with
us
lads
by
god
hup
with
us
and
he
made
a
spring
into
the
fore
rigging
i
shoved
the
handle
of
the
lantern
between
my
teeth
and
followed
plummer
was
coming
but
the
second
mate
pulled
him
back
that
sufficient
he
said
i
going
and
he
came
up
after
me
we
went
over
the
foretop
racing
like
fiends
the
light
from
the
lantern
prevented
me
from
seeing
to
any
distance
in
the
darkness
but
at
the
crosstrees
stubbins
who
was
some
ratlines
ahead
shouted
out
all
at
once
and
in
gasps
they
fightin
like
hell
what
called
the
second
mate
breathlessly
apparently
stubbins
did
not
hear
him
for
he
made
no
reply
we
cleared
the
crosstrees
and
climbed
into
the
rigging
the
wind
was
fairly
fresh
up
there
and
overhead
there
sounded
the
flap
flap
of
sailcloth
flying
in
the
wind
but
since
we
had
left
the
deck
there
had
been
no
other
sound
from
above
now
abruptly
there
came
again
a
wild
crying
from
the
darkness
over
us
a
strange
wild
medley
it
was
of
screams
for
help
mixed
up
with
violent
breathless
curses
beneath
the
royal
yard
stubbins
halted
and
looked
down
to
me
hurry
hup
with
ther
lantern
jessop
he
shouted
catching
his
breath
between
the
words
there
be
murder
done
hin
a
minute
i
reached
him
and
held
the
light
up
for
him
to
catch
he
stooped
and
took
it
from
me
then
holding
it
above
his
head
he
went
a
few
ratlines
higher
in
this
manner
he
reached
to
a
level
with
the
royal
yard
from
my
position
a
little
below
him
the
lantern
seemed
but
to
throw
a
few
straggling
flickering
rays
along
the
spar
yet
they
showed
me
something
my
first
glance
had
been
to
and
i
had
seen
at
once
that
there
was
nothing
on
the
weather
yard
arm
from
there
my
gaze
went
to
leeward
indistinctly
i
saw
something
upon
the
yard
that
clung
struggling
stubbins
bent
towards
it
with
the
light
thus
i
saw
it
more
clearly
it
was
jacobs
the
ordinary
seaman
he
had
his
right
arm
tightly
round
the
yard
with
the
other
he
appeared
to
be
fending
himself
from
something
on
the
other
side
of
him
and
further
out
upon
the
yard
at
times
moans
and
gasps
came
from
him
and
sometimes
curses
once
as
he
appeared
to
be
dragged
partly
from
his
hold
he
screamed
like
a
woman
his
whole
attitude
suggested
stubborn
despair
i
can
scarcely
tell
you
how
this
extraordinary
sight
affected
me
i
seemed
to
stare
at
it
without
realising
that
the
affair
was
a
real
happening
during
the
few
seconds
which
i
had
spent
staring
and
breathless
stubbins
had
climbed
round
the
after
side
of
the
mast
and
now
i
began
again
to
follow
him
from
his
position
below
me
the
second
had
not
been
able
to
see
the
thing
that
was
occurring
on
the
yard
and
he
sung
out
to
me
to
know
what
was
happening
it
jacobs
sir
i
called
back
he
seems
to
be
fighting
with
someone
to
looard
of
him
i
ca
see
very
plainly
yet
stubbins
had
got
round
on
to
the
lee
and
now
he
held
the
lantern
up
peering
and
i
made
my
way
quickly
alongside
of
him
the
second
mate
followed
but
instead
of
getting
down
on
to
the
he
got
on
the
yard
and
stood
there
holding
on
to
the
tie
he
sung
out
for
one
of
us
to
pass
him
up
the
lantern
which
i
did
stubbins
handing
it
to
me
the
second
held
it
out
at
arm
length
so
that
it
lit
up
the
lee
part
of
the
yard
the
light
showed
through
the
darkness
as
far
as
to
where
jacobs
struggled
so
weirdly
beyond
him
nothing
was
distinct
there
had
been
a
moment
delay
while
we
were
passing
the
lantern
up
to
the
second
mate
now
however
stubbins
and
i
moved
out
slowly
along
the
we
went
slowly
but
we
did
well
to
go
at
all
with
any
show
of
boldness
for
the
whole
business
was
so
abominably
uncanny
it
seems
impossible
to
convey
truly
to
you
the
strange
scene
on
the
royal
yard
you
may
be
able
to
picture
it
yourselves
the
second
mate
standing
upon
the
spar
holding
the
lantern
his
body
swaying
with
each
roll
of
the
ship
and
his
head
craned
forward
as
he
peered
along
the
yard
on
our
left
jacobs
mad
fighting
cursing
praying
gasping
and
outside
of
him
shadows
and
the
night
the
second
mate
spoke
abruptly
hold
on
a
moment
he
said
then
jacobs
he
shouted
jacobs
do
you
hear
me
there
was
no
reply
only
the
continual
gasping
and
cursing
go
on
the
second
mate
said
to
us
but
be
careful
keep
a
tight
hold
he
held
the
lantern
higher
and
we
went
out
cautiously
stubbins
reached
the
ordinary
and
put
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
with
a
soothing
gesture
steady
hon
now
jacobs
he
said
steady
hon
at
his
touch
as
though
by
magic
the
young
fellow
calmed
down
and
stubbins
reaching
round
him
grasped
the
jackstay
on
the
other
side
get
a
hold
of
him
your
side
jessop
he
sung
out
i
get
this
side
this
i
did
and
stubbins
climbed
round
him
there
hai
no
one
here
stubbins
called
to
me
but
his
voice
expressed
no
surprise
what
sung
out
the
second
mate
no
one
there
where
svensen
then
i
did
not
catch
stubbins
reply
for
suddenly
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
saw
something
shadowy
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
yard
out
by
the
lift
i
stared
it
rose
up
on
the
yard
and
i
saw
that
it
was
the
figure
of
a
man
it
grasped
at
the
lift
and
commenced
to
swarm
up
quickly
it
passed
diagonally
above
stubbins
head
and
reached
down
a
vague
hand
and
arm
look
out
stubbins
i
shouted
look
out
what
up
now
he
called
in
a
startled
voice
at
the
same
instant
his
cap
went
whirling
away
to
leeward
damn
the
wind
he
burst
out
then
all
at
once
jacobs
who
had
only
been
giving
an
occasional
moan
commenced
to
shriek
and
struggle
hold
fast
onto
him
stubbins
yelled
he
be
throwin
himself
off
the
yard
i
put
my
left
arm
round
the
ordinary
body
getting
hold
of
the
jackstay
on
the
other
side
then
i
looked
up
above
us
i
seemed
to
see
something
dark
and
indistinct
that
moved
rapidly
up
the
lift
keep
tight
hold
of
him
while
i
get
a
gasket
i
heard
the
second
mate
sing
out
a
moment
later
there
was
a
crash
and
the
light
disappeared
damn
and
set
fire
to
the
sail
shouted
the
second
mate
i
twisted
round
somewhat
and
looked
in
his
direction
i
could
dimly
make
him
out
on
the
yard
he
had
evidently
been
in
the
act
of
getting
down
on
to
the
when
the
lantern
was
smashed
from
him
my
gaze
jumped
to
the
lee
rigging
it
seemed
that
i
made
out
some
shadowy
thing
stealing
down
through
the
darkness
but
i
could
not
be
sure
and
then
in
a
breath
it
had
gone
anything
wrong
sir
i
called
out
yes
he
answered
i
dropped
the
lantern
the
blessed
sail
knocked
it
out
of
my
hand
we
be
all
right
sir
i
replied
i
think
we
can
manage
without
it
jacobs
seems
to
be
quieter
now
well
be
careful
as
you
come
in
he
warned
us
come
on
jacobs
i
said
come
on
we
go
down
on
deck
go
along
young
feller
stubbins
put
in
you
right
now
we
take
care
of
you
and
we
started
to
guide
him
along
the
yard
he
went
willingly
enough
though
without
saying
a
word
he
seemed
like
a
child
once
or
twice
he
shivered
but
said
nothing
we
got
him
in
to
the
lee
rigging
then
one
going
beside
him
and
the
other
keeping
below
we
made
our
way
slowly
down
on
deck
we
went
very
slowly
so
slowly
in
fact
that
the
second
mate
who
had
stayed
a
minute
to
shove
the
gasket
round
the
lee
side
of
the
sail
was
almost
as
soon
down
take
jacobs
forrard
to
his
bunk
he
said
and
went
away
aft
to
where
a
crowd
of
the
men
one
with
a
lantern
stood
round
the
door
of
an
empty
berth
under
the
break
of
the
poop
on
the
starboard
side
we
hurried
forrard
to
the
there
we
found
all
in
darkness
they
haft
with
jock
and
svenson
stubbins
had
hesitated
an
instant
before
saying
the
name
yes
i
replied
that
what
it
must
have
been
right
enough
i
kind
of
knew
it
all
ther
time
he
said
i
stepped
in
through
the
doorway
and
struck
a
match
stubbins
followed
guiding
jacobs
before
him
and
together
we
got
him
into
his
bunk
we
covered
him
up
with
his
blankets
for
he
was
pretty
shivery
then
we
came
out
during
the
whole
time
he
had
not
spoken
a
word
as
we
went
aft
stubbins
remarked
that
he
thought
the
business
must
have
made
him
a
bit
dotty
it
driven
him
clean
barmy
he
went
on
he
do
hunderstand
a
word
that
said
ter
him
he
may
be
different
in
the
morning
i
answered
as
we
neared
the
poop
and
the
crowd
of
waiting
men
he
spoke
again
they
put
hinter
ther
second
hempty
berth
yes
i
said
poor
beggars
we
reached
the
other
men
and
they
opened
out
and
allowed
us
to
get
near
the
door
several
of
them
asked
in
low
tones
whether
jacobs
was
all
right
and
i
told
them
yes
not
saying
anything
then
about
his
condition
i
got
close
up
to
the
doorway
and
looked
into
the
berth
the
lamp
was
lit
and
i
could
see
plainly
there
were
two
bunks
in
the
place
and
a
man
had
been
laid
in
each
the
skipper
was
there
leaning
up
against
a
bulkshead
he
looked
worried
but
was
silent
seeming
to
be
mooding
in
his
own
thoughts
the
second
mate
was
busy
with
a
couple
of
flags
which
he
was
spreading
over
the
bodies
the
first
mate
was
talking
evidently
telling
him
something
but
his
tone
was
so
low
that
i
caught
his
words
only
with
difficulty
it
struck
me
that
he
seemed
pretty
subdued
i
got
parts
of
his
sentences
in
patches
as
it
were
broken
i
heard
him
say
and
the
dutchman
i
seen
him
the
second
mate
said
shortly
two
straight
off
the
reel
said
the
mate
three
in
the
second
made
no
reply
of
course
yer
know
accident
the
first
mate
went
on
is
it
the
second
said
in
a
queer
voice
i
saw
the
mate
glance
at
him
in
a
doubtful
sort
of
way
but
the
second
was
covering
poor
old
jock
dead
face
and
did
not
appear
to
notice
his
look
it
it
the
mate
said
and
stopped
after
a
moment
hesitation
he
said
something
further
that
i
could
not
catch
but
there
seemed
a
lot
of
funk
in
his
voice
the
second
mate
appeared
not
to
have
heard
him
at
any
rate
he
made
no
reply
but
bent
and
straightened
out
a
corner
of
the
flag
over
the
rigid
figure
in
the
lower
bunk
there
was
a
certain
niceness
in
his
action
which
made
me
warm
towards
him
he
white
i
thought
to
myself
out
loud
i
said
we
put
jacobs
into
his
bunk
sir
the
mate
jumped
then
whizzed
round
and
stared
at
me
as
though
i
had
been
a
ghost
the
second
mate
turned
also
but
before
he
could
speak
the
skipper
took
a
step
towards
me
is
he
all
right
he
asked
well
sir
i
said
he
a
bit
queer
but
i
think
it
possible
he
may
be
better
after
a
sleep
i
hope
so
too
he
replied
and
stepped
out
on
deck
he
went
towards
the
starboard
poop
ladder
walking
slowly
the
second
went
and
stood
by
the
lamp
and
the
mate
after
a
quick
glance
at
him
came
out
and
followed
the
skipper
up
on
to
the
poop
it
occurred
to
me
then
like
a
flash
that
the
man
had
stumbled
upon
a
portion
of
the
this
accident
coming
so
soon
after
that
other
it
was
evident
that
in
his
mind
he
had
connected
them
i
recollected
the
fragments
of
his
remarks
to
the
second
mate
then
those
many
minor
happenings
that
had
cropped
up
at
different
times
and
at
which
he
had
sneered
i
wondered
whether
he
would
begin
to
comprehend
their
significance
their
beastly
sinister
significance
ah
i
thought
to
myself
you
in
for
a
bad
time
if
you
begun
to
understand
abruptly
my
thoughts
jumped
to
the
vague
future
before
us
god
help
us
i
muttered
the
second
mate
after
a
look
round
turned
down
the
wick
of
the
lamp
and
came
out
closing
the
door
after
him
now
you
men
he
said
to
the
mate
watch
get
forrard
we
ca
do
anything
more
you
better
go
and
get
some
sleep
i
i
sir
they
said
in
a
chorus
then
as
we
all
turned
to
go
forrard
he
asked
if
anyone
had
relieved
the
no
sir
answered
quoin
is
it
yours
the
second
asked
yes
sir
he
replied
hurry
up
and
relieve
him
then
the
second
said
i
i
sir
the
man
answered
and
went
forrard
with
the
rest
of
us
as
we
went
i
asked
plummer
who
was
at
the
wheel
tom
he
said
as
he
spoke
several
spots
of
rain
fell
and
i
glanced
up
at
the
sky
it
had
become
thickly
clouded
looks
as
if
it
were
going
to
breeze
up
i
said
yes
he
replied
we
be
shortenin
down
long
may
be
an
job
i
remarked
yes
he
answered
again
be
no
use
their
turnin
in
if
it
is
the
man
who
was
carrying
the
lantern
went
into
the
and
we
followed
where
ther
one
belongin
to
our
side
plummer
asked
got
smashed
hupstairs
answered
stubbins
were
that
plummer
inquired
stubbins
hesitated
the
second
mate
dropped
it
i
replied
the
sail
hit
it
or
something
the
men
in
the
other
watch
seemed
to
have
no
immediate
intention
of
but
sat
in
their
bunks
and
around
on
the
chests
there
was
a
general
lighting
of
pipes
in
the
midst
of
which
there
came
a
sudden
moan
from
one
of
the
bunks
in
the
forepart
of
the
a
part
that
was
always
a
bit
gloomy
and
was
more
so
now
on
account
of
our
having
only
one
lamp
wot
that
asked
one
of
the
men
belonging
to
the
other
side
s
sh
said
stubbins
it
him
inquired
plummer
jacobs
yes
i
replied
poor
devil
wot
were
yer
got
hup
asked
the
man
on
the
other
side
indicating
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
the
fore
royal
before
i
could
reply
stubbins
jumped
up
from
his
ther
second
mate
whistlin
he
said
come
hon
and
he
ran
out
on
deck
plummer
jaskett
and
i
followed
quickly
outside
it
had
started
to
rain
pretty
heavily
as
we
went
the
second
mate
voice
came
to
us
through
the
darkness
stand
by
the
main
royal
clewlines
and
buntlines
i
heard
him
shout
and
the
next
instant
came
the
hollow
thutter
of
the
sail
as
he
started
to
lower
away
in
a
few
minutes
we
had
it
hauled
up
up
and
furl
it
a
couple
of
you
he
sung
out
i
went
towards
the
starboard
rigging
then
i
hesitated
no
one
else
had
moved
the
second
mate
came
among
us
come
on
now
lads
he
said
make
a
move
it
got
to
be
done
i
go
i
said
if
someone
else
will
come
still
no
one
stirred
and
no
one
answered
tammy
came
across
to
me
i
come
he
volunteered
in
a
nervous
voice
no
by
god
no
said
the
second
mate
abruptly
he
jumped
into
the
main
rigging
himself
come
along
jessop
he
shouted
i
followed
him
but
i
was
astonished
i
had
fully
expected
him
to
get
on
to
the
other
fellows
tracks
like
a
ton
of
bricks
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
that
he
was
making
allowances
i
was
simply
puzzled
then
but
afterwards
it
dawned
upon
me
no
sooner
had
i
followed
the
second
mate
than
straightway
stubbins
plummer
and
jaskett
came
up
after
us
at
a
run
about
to
the
maintop
the
second
mate
stopped
and
looked
down
who
that
coming
up
below
you
jessop
he
asked
before
i
could
speak
stubbins
answered
it
me
sir
an
plummer
an
jaskett
who
the
devil
told
you
to
come
go
straight
down
the
lot
of
you
we
comin
hup
ter
keep
you
company
sir
was
his
reply
at
that
i
was
confident
of
a
burst
of
temper
from
the
second
and
yet
for
the
second
time
within
a
couple
of
minutes
i
was
wrong
instead
of
cursing
stubbins
he
after
a
moment
pause
went
on
up
the
rigging
without
another
word
and
the
rest
of
us
followed
we
reached
the
royal
and
made
short
work
of
it
indeed
there
were
sufficient
of
us
to
have
eaten
it
when
we
had
finished
i
noticed
that
the
second
mate
remained
on
the
yard
until
we
were
all
in
the
rigging
evidently
he
had
determined
to
take
a
full
share
of
any
risk
there
might
be
but
i
took
care
to
keep
pretty
close
to
him
so
as
to
be
on
hand
if
anything
happened
yet
we
reached
the
deck
again
without
anything
having
occurred
i
have
said
without
anything
having
occurred
but
i
am
not
really
correct
in
this
for
as
the
second
mate
came
down
over
the
crosstrees
he
gave
a
short
abrupt
cry
anything
wrong
sir
i
asked
no
o
he
said
nothing
i
banged
my
knee
and
yet
i
believe
he
was
lying
for
that
same
watch
i
was
to
hear
men
giving
just
such
cries
but
god
knows
they
had
reason
enough
x
that
directly
we
reached
the
deck
the
second
mate
gave
the
order
mizzen
clewlines
and
buntlines
and
led
the
way
up
on
to
the
poop
he
went
and
stood
by
the
haulyards
ready
to
lower
away
as
i
walked
across
to
the
starboard
clewline
i
saw
that
the
old
man
was
on
deck
and
as
i
took
hold
of
the
rope
i
heard
him
sing
out
to
the

i

in
through

doorway
and

of
the
men
beginning
to
it

whole
blooming

wot
he

i
said

we
just
made
a
mouthful
apiece
of
it
and
came
down
again
all
the
same
remarked
the
second
man
i
do
fancy

i
replied
it

matter
of
fancy

or

a
mess
one
of

the
glass

falling
come
erlong
boys
we
got
ter
du
it
said
one
of
the
older
men
rising
from
a
chest
at
this
point
what
it
duin
outside
mate
raining
i
said
you
want
your
oilskins
i
hesitated
a
moment
before
going
on
deck
again
from
the
bunk
forrard
among
the
shadows
i
had
seemed
to
hear
a
faint
moan
poor
beggar
i
thought
to
myself
then
the
old
chap
who
had
last
spoken
broke
in
upon
my
attention
it
awl
right
mate
he
said
rather
testily
yer
need
wait
we
be
out
in
er
minit
that
all
right
i
was
thinking
about
you
lot
i
replied
and
walked
forrard
to
jacobs
bunk
some
time
before
he
had
rigged
up
a
pair
of
curtains
cut
out
of
an
old
sack
to
keep
off
the
draught
these
some
one
had
drawn
so
that
i
had
to
pull
them
aside
to
see
him
he
was
lying
on
his
back
breathing
in
a
queer
jerky
fashion
i
could
not
see
his
face
plainly
but
it
seemed
rather
pale
in
the
jacobs
i
said
jacobs
how
do
you
feel
now
but
he
made
no
sign
to
show
that
he
had
heard
me
and
so
after
a
few
moments
i
drew
the
curtains
to
again
and
left
him
what
like
does
seem
asked
one
of
the
fellows
as
i
went
towards
the
door
bad
i
said
damn
bad
i
think
the
steward
ought
to
be
told
to
come
and
have
a
look
at
him
i
mention
it
to
the
second
when
i
get
a
chance
i
stepped
out
on
deck
and
ran
aft
again
to
give
them
a
hand
with
the
sail
we
got
it
hauled
up
and
then
went
forrard
to
the
fore
and
a
minute
later
the
other
watch
were
out
and
with
the
mate
were
busy
at
the
main
by
the
time
the
main
was
ready
for
making
fast
we
had
the
fore
hauled
up
so
that
now
all
three
were
in
the
ropes
and
ready
for
stowing
then
came
the
order
up
aloft
and
furl
up
with
you
lads
the
second
mate
said
do
let
have
any
hanging
back
this
time
away
aft
by
the
main
the
men
in
the
mate
watch
seemed
to
be
standing
in
a
clump
by
the
mast
but
it
was
too
dark
to
see
clearly
i
heard
the
mate
start
to
curse
then
there
came
a
growl
and
he
shut
up
be
handy
men
be
handy
the
second
mate
sung
out
at
that
stubbins
jumped
into
the
rigging
come
hon
he
shouted
we
have
ther
bloomin
sail
fast
an
down
hon
deck
again
before
they
started
plummer
followed
then
jaskett
i
and
quoin
who
had
been
called
down
off
the
to
give
a
hand
that
the
style
lads
the
second
sung
out
encouragingly
then
he
ran
aft
to
the
mate
crowd
i
heard
him
and
the
mate
talking
to
the
men
and
presently
when
we
were
going
over
the
foretop
i
made
out
that
they
were
beginning
to
get
into
the
rigging
i
found
out
afterwards
that
as
soon
as
the
second
mate
had
seen
them
off
the
deck
he
went
up
to
the
mizzen
along
with
the
four
on
our
part
we
made
our
way
slowly
aloft
keeping
one
hand
for
ourselves
and
the
other
for
the
ship
as
you
can
fancy
in
this
manner
we
had
gone
as
far
as
the
crosstrees
at
least
stubbins
who
was
first
had
when
all
at
once
he
gave
out
just
another
such
cry
as
had
the
second
mate
a
little
earlier
only
that
in
his
case
he
followed
it
by
turning
round
and
blasting
plummer
you
might
have
blarsted
well
sent
me
flyin
down
hon
deck
he
shouted
if
you
bl
dy
well
think
it
a
joke
try
it
hon
some
one
else
it
was
me
interrupted
plummer
i
touched
yer
the
are
yer
swearin
at
at
you
i
heard
him
reply
but
what
more
he
may
have
said
was
lost
in
a
loud
shout
from
plummer
what
up
plummer
i
sung
out
for
god
sake
you
two
do
get
fighting
up
aloft
but
a
loud
frightened
curse
was
all
the
answer
he
gave
then
straightway
he
began
to
shout
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
in
the
lulls
of
his
noise
i
caught
the
voice
of
stubbins
cursing
savagely
they
come
down
with
a
run
i
shouted
helplessly
they
come
down
as
sure
as
nuts
i
caught
jaskett
by
the
boot
what
are
they
doing
what
are
they
doing
i
sung
out
ca
you
see
i
shook
his
leg
as
i
spoke
but
at
my
touch
the
old
idiot
as
i
thought
him
at
the
moment
began
to
shout
in
a
frightened
voice
oh
oh
help
hel
shut
up
i
bellowed
shut
up
you
old
fool
if
you
wo
do
anything
let
me
get
past
you
yet
he
only
cried
out
the
more
and
then
abruptly
i
caught
the
sound
of
a
frightened
clamour
of
men
voices
away
down
somewhere
about
the
maintop
curses
cries
of
fear
even
shrieks
and
above
it
all
someone
shouting
to
go
down
on
deck
get
down
get
down
down
down
blarst
the
rest
was
drowned
in
a
fresh
outburst
of
hoarse
crying
in
the
night
i
tried
to
get
past
old
jaskett
but
he
was
clinging
to
the
rigging
sprawled
on
to
it
is
the
best
way
to
describe
his
attitude
so
much
of
it
as
i
could
see
in
the
darkness
up
above
him
stubbins
and
plummer
still
shouted
and
cursed
and
the
shrouds
quivered
and
shook
as
though
the
two
were
fighting
desperately
stubbins
seemed
to
be
shouting
something
definite
but
whatever
it
was
i
could
not
catch
at
my
helplessness
i
grew
angry
and
shook
and
prodded
jaskett
to
make
him
move
damn
you
jaskett
i
roared
damn
you
for
a
funky
old
fool
let
me
get
past
let
me
get
past
will
you
but
instead
of
letting
me
pass
i
found
that
he
was
beginning
to
make
his
way
down
at
that
i
caught
him
by
the
slack
of
his
trousers
near
the
stern
with
my
right
hand
and
with
the
other
i
got
hold
of
the
after
shroud
somewhere
above
his
left
hip
by
these
means
i
fairly
hoisted
myself
up
on
to
the
old
fellow
back
then
with
my
right
i
could
reach
to
the
forrard
shroud
over
his
right
shoulder
and
having
got
a
grip
i
shifted
my
left
to
a
level
with
it
at
the
same
moment
i
was
able
to
get
my
foot
on
to
the
splice
of
a
ratline
and
so
give
myself
a
further
lift
then
i
paused
an
instant
and
glanced
up
stubbins
stubbins
i
shouted
plummer
plummer
and
even
as
i
called
plummer
foot
reaching
down
through
the
gloom
alighted
full
on
my
upturned
face
i
let
go
from
the
rigging
with
my
right
hand
and
struck
furiously
at
his
leg
cursing
him
for
his
clumsiness
he
lifted
his
foot
and
in
the
same
instant
a
sentence
from
stubbins
floated
down
to
me
with
a
strange
distinctness
god
sake
tell
to
get
down
hon
deck
he
was
shouting
even
as
the
words
came
to
me
something
in
the
darkness
gripped
my
waist
i
made
a
desperate
clutch
at
the
rigging
with
my
disengaged
right
hand
and
it
was
well
for
me
that
i
secured
the
hold
so
quickly
for
the
same
instant
i
was
wrenched
at
with
a
brutal
ferocity
that
appalled
me
i
said
nothing
but
lashed
out
into
the
night
with
my
left
foot
it
is
queer
but
i
can
not
say
with
certainty
that
i
struck
anything
i
was
too
downright
desperate
with
funk
to
be
sure
and
yet
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
foot
encountered
something
soft
that
gave
under
the
blow
it
may
have
been
nothing
more
than
an
imagined
sensation
yet
i
am
inclined
to
think
otherwise
for
instantly
the
hold
about
my
waist
was
released
and
i
commenced
to
scramble
down
clutching
the
shrouds
pretty
desperately
i
have
only
a
very
uncertain
remembrance
of
that
which
followed
whether
i
slid
over
jaskett
or
whether
he
gave
way
to
me
i
can
not
tell
i
know
only
that
i
reached
the
deck
in
a
blind
whirl
of
fear
and
excitement
and
the
next
thing
i
remember
i
was
among
a
crowd
of
shouting
xi
search
for
in
a
confused
way
i
was
conscious
that
the
skipper
and
the
mates
were
down
among
us
trying
to
get
us
into
some
state
of
calmness
eventually
they
succeeded
and
we
were
told
to
go
aft
to
the
saloon
door
which
we
did
in
a
body
here
the
skipper
himself
served
out
a
large
tot
of
rum
to
each
of
us
then
at
his
orders
the
second
mate
called
the
roll
he
called
over
the
mate
watch
first
and
everyone
answered
then
he
came
to
ours
and
he
must
have
been
much
agitated
for
the
first
name
he
sung
out
was
jock
among
us
there
came
a
moment
of
dead
silence
and
i
noticed
the
wail
and
moan
of
the
wind
aloft
and
the
flap
flap
of
the
three
unfurled
the
second
mate
called
the
next
name
hurriedly
jaskett
he
sung
out
sir
jaskett
answered
quoin
yes
sir
jessop
sir
i
replied
stubbins
there
was
no
answer
stubbins
again
called
the
second
mate
again
there
was
no
reply
is
stubbins
here
anyone
the
second
voice
sounded
sharp
and
anxious
there
was
a
moment
pause
then
one
of
the
men
spoke
he
not
here
sir
who
saw
him
last
the
second
asked
plummer
stepped
forward
into
the
light
that
streamed
through
the
saloon
doorway
he
had
on
neither
coat
nor
cap
and
his
shirt
seemed
to
be
hanging
about
him
in
tatters
it
were
me
sir
he
said
the
old
man
who
was
standing
next
to
the
second
mate
took
a
pace
towards
him
and
stopped
and
stared
but
it
was
the
second
who
spoke
where
he
asked
were
just
above
me
in
ther
crosstrees
when
when
the
man
broke
off
short
yes
yes
the
second
mate
replied
then
he
turned
to
the
skipper
someone
will
have
to
go
up
sir
and
see
he
hesitated
but
said
the
old
man
and
stopped
the
second
mate
cut
in
i
shall
go
up
for
one
sir
he
said
quietly
then
he
turned
back
to
the
crowd
of
us
tammy
he
sung
out
get
a
couple
of
lamps
out
of
the
i
i
sir
tammy
replied
and
ran
off
now
said
the
second
mate
addressing
us
i
want
a
couple
of
men
to
jump
aloft
along
with
me
and
take
a
look
for
stubbins
not
a
man
replied
i
would
have
liked
to
step
out
and
offer
but
the
memory
of
that
horrible
clutch
was
with
me
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
summon
up
the
courage
come
come
men
he
said
we
ca
leave
him
up
there
we
shall
take
lanterns
who
come
now
i
walked
out
to
the
front
i
was
in
a
horrible
funk
but
for
very
shame
i
could
not
stand
back
any
longer
i
come
with
you
sir
i
said
not
very
loud
and
feeling
fairly
twisted
up
with
nervousness
that
more
the
tune
jessop
he
replied
in
a
tone
that
made
me
glad
i
had
stood
out
at
this
point
tammy
came
up
with
the
lights
he
brought
them
to
the
second
who
took
one
and
told
him
to
give
the
other
to
me
the
second
mate
held
his
light
above
his
head
and
looked
round
at
the
hesitating
men
now
men
he
sung
out
you
not
going
to
let
jessop
and
me
go
up
alone
come
along
another
one
or
two
of
you
do
act
like
a
damned
lot
of
cowards
quoin
stood
out
and
spoke
for
the
crowd
i
dunno
as
we
actin
like
cowyards
sir
but
just
look
at
and
he
pointed
at
plummer
who
still
stood
full
in
the
light
from
the
saloon
doorway
what
sort
of
a
thing
is
it
done
that
sir
he
went
on
an
then
yer
arsks
us
ter
go
up
agen
it
are
likely
as
we
in
a
the
second
mate
looked
at
plummer
and
surely
as
i
have
before
mentioned
the
poor
beggar
was
in
a
state
his
shirt
was
fairly
flapping
in
the
breeze
that
came
through
the
doorway
the
second
looked
yet
he
said
nothing
it
was
as
though
the
realisation
of
plummer
condition
had
left
him
without
a
word
more
to
say
it
was
plummer
himself
who
finally
broke
the
silence
i
come
with
yer
sir
he
said
only
yer
ought
ter
more
light
than
them
two
lanterns
be
no
use
unless
we
plenty
er
light
the
man
had
grit
and
i
was
astonished
at
his
offering
to
go
after
what
he
must
have
gone
through
yet
i
was
to
have
even
a
greater
astonishment
for
abruptly
the
skipper
who
all
this
time
had
scarcely
spoken
stepped
forward
a
pace
and
put
his
hand
on
the
second
shoulder
i
come
with
you
tulipson
he
said
the
second
mate
twisted
his
head
round
and
stared
at
him
a
moment
in
astonishment
then
he
opened
his
mouth
no
sir
i
do
think
he
began
that
sufficient
tulipson
the
old
man
interrupted
i
made
up
my
mind
he
turned
to
the
first
mate
who
had
stood
by
without
a
word
grainge
he
said
take
a
couple
of
the
down
with
you
and
pass
out
a
box
of
and
some
the
mate
answered
something
and
hurried
away
into
the
saloon
with
the
two
in
his
watch
then
the
old
man
spoke
to
the
men
now
men
he
began
this
is
no
time
for
the
second
mate
and
i
will
go
aloft
and
i
want
about
half
a
dozen
of
you
to
come
along
with
us
and
carry
lights
plummer
and
jessop
here
have
volunteered
i
want
four
or
five
more
of
you
step
out
now
some
of
you
there
was
no
hesitation
whatever
now
and
the
first
man
to
come
forward
was
quoin
after
him
followed
three
of
the
mate
crowd
and
then
old
jaskett
that
will
do
that
will
do
said
the
old
man
he
turned
to
the
second
mate
has
grainge
come
with
those
lights
yet
he
asked
with
a
certain
irritability
here
sir
said
the
first
mate
voice
behind
him
in
the
saloon
doorway
he
had
the
box
of
in
his
hands
and
behind
him
came
the
two
boys
carrying
the
flares
the
skipper
took
the
box
from
him
with
a
quick
gesture
and
opened
it
now
one
of
you
men
come
here
he
ordered
one
of
the
men
in
the
mate
watch
ran
to
him
he
took
several
of
the
lights
from
the
box
and
handed
them
to
the
man
see
here
he
said
when
we
go
aloft
you
get
into
the
foretop
and
keep
one
of
these
going
all
the
time
do
you
hear
yes
sir
replied
the
man
you
know
how
to
strike
them
the
skipper
asked
abruptly
yes
sir
he
answered
the
skipper
sung
out
to
the
second
mate
where
that
boy
of
yours
tammy
mr
tulipson
here
sir
said
tammy
answering
for
himself
the
old
man
took
another
light
from
the
box
listen
to
me
boy
he
said
take
this
and
on
the
forrard
deck
house
when
we
go
aloft
you
must
give
us
a
light
until
the
man
gets
his
going
in
the
top
you
understand
yes
sir
answered
tammy
and
took
the
light
one
minute
said
the
old
man
and
stooped
and
took
a
second
light
from
the
box
your
first
light
may
go
out
before
we
ready
you
better
have
another
in
case
it
does
tammy
took
the
second
light
and
moved
away
those
flares
all
ready
for
lighting
there
mr
grainge
the
captain
asked
all
ready
sir
replied
the
mate
the
old
man
pushed
one
of
the
into
his
coat
pocket
and
stood
upright
very
well
he
said
give
each
of
the
men
one
apiece
and
just
see
that
they
all
have
matches
he
spoke
to
the
men
particularly
as
soon
as
we
are
ready
the
other
two
men
in
the
mate
watch
will
get
up
into
the
cranelines
and
keep
their
flares
going
there
take
your
paraffin
tins
with
you
when
we
reach
the
upper
topsail
quoin
and
jaskett
will
get
out
on
the
and
show
their
flares
there
be
careful
to
keep
your
lights
away
from
the
sails
plummer
and
jessop
will
come
up
with
the
second
mate
and
myself
does
every
man
clearly
understand
yes
sir
said
the
men
in
a
chorus
a
sudden
idea
seemed
to
occur
to
the
skipper
and
he
turned
and
went
through
the
doorway
into
the
saloon
in
about
a
minute
he
came
back
and
handed
something
to
the
second
mate
that
shone
in
the
light
from
the
lanterns
i
saw
that
it
was
a
revolver
and
he
held
another
in
his
other
hand
and
this
i
saw
him
put
into
his
side
pocket
the
second
mate
held
the
pistol
a
moment
looking
a
bit
doubtful
i
do
think
sir
he
began
but
the
skipper
cut
him
short
you
do
know
he
said
put
it
in
your
pocket
then
he
turned
to
the
first
mate
you
will
take
charge
of
the
deck
grainge
while
we
aloft
he
said
i
i
sir
the
mate
answered
and
sung
out
to
one
of
his
to
take
the
box
back
into
the
cabin
the
old
man
turned
and
led
the
way
forrard
as
we
went
the
light
from
the
two
lanterns
shone
upon
the
decks
showing
the
litter
of
the
gear
the
ropes
were
foul
of
one
another
in
a
regular
bunch
o
buffers
this
had
been
caused
i
suppose
by
the
crowd
trampling
over
them
in
their
excitement
when
they
reached
the
deck
and
then
suddenly
as
though
the
sight
had
waked
me
up
to
a
more
vivid
comprehension
you
know
it
came
to
me
new
and
fresh
how
damned
strange
was
the
whole
business
i
got
a
little
touch
of
despair
and
asked
myself
what
was
going
to
be
the
end
of
all
these
beastly
happenings
you
can
understand
footnote
modified
from
the
original
abruptly
i
heard
the
skipper
shouting
away
forward
he
was
singing
out
to
tammy
to
get
up
on
to
the
house
with
his
we
reached
the
fore
rigging
and
the
same
instant
the
strange
ghastly
flare
of
tammy
burst
out
into
the
night
causing
every
rope
sail
and
spar
to
jump
out
weirdly
i
saw
now
that
the
second
mate
was
already
in
the
starboard
rigging
with
his
lantern
he
was
shouting
to
tammy
to
keep
the
drip
from
his
light
clear
of
the
staysail
which
was
stowed
upon
the
house
then
from
somewhere
on
the
port
side
i
heard
the
skipper
shout
to
us
to
hurry
smartly
now
you
men
he
was
saying
smartly
now
the
man
who
had
been
told
to
take
up
a
station
in
the
was
just
behind
the
second
mate
plummer
was
a
couple
of
ratlines
lower
i
caught
the
old
man
voice
again
where
jessop
with
that
other
lantern
i
heard
him
shout
here
sir
i
sung
out
bring
it
over
this
side
he
ordered
you
do
want
the
two
lanterns
on
one
side
i
ran
round
the
fore
side
of
the
house
then
i
saw
him
he
was
in
the
rigging
and
making
his
way
smartly
aloft
one
of
the
mate
watch
and
quoin
were
with
him
this
i
saw
as
i
came
round
the
house
then
i
made
a
jump
gripped
the
sheerpole
and
swung
myself
up
on
to
the
rail
and
then
all
at
once
tammy
went
out
and
there
came
what
seemed
by
contrast
pitchy
darkness
i
stood
where
i
was
one
foot
on
the
rail
and
my
knee
upon
the
sheerpole
the
light
from
my
lantern
seemed
no
more
than
a
sickly
yellow
glow
against
the
gloom
and
higher
some
forty
or
fifty
feet
and
a
few
ratlines
below
the
futtock
rigging
on
the
starboard
side
there
was
another
glow
of
yellowness
in
the
night
apart
from
these
all
was
blackness
and
then
from
above
high
above
there
wailed
down
through
the
darkness
a
weird
sobbing
cry
what
it
was
i
do
not
know
but
it
sounded
horrible
the
skipper
voice
came
down
jerkily
smartly
with
that
light
boy
he
shouted
and
the
blue
glare
blazed
out
again
almost
before
he
had
finished
speaking
i
stared
up
at
the
skipper
he
was
standing
where
i
had
seen
him
before
the
light
went
out
and
so
were
the
two
men
as
i
looked
he
commenced
to
climb
again
i
glanced
across
to
starboard
jaskett
and
the
other
man
in
the
mate
watch
were
about
midway
between
the
deck
of
the
house
and
the
foretop
their
faces
showed
extraordinary
pale
in
the
dead
glare
of
the
higher
i
saw
the
second
mate
in
the
futtock
rigging
holding
his
light
up
over
the
edge
of
the
top
then
he
went
further
and
disappeared
the
man
with
the
followed
and
also
vanished
from
view
on
the
port
side
and
more
directly
above
me
the
feet
were
just
stepping
out
of
the
futtock
shrouds
at
that
i
made
haste
to
follow
then
suddenly
when
i
was
close
under
the
top
there
came
from
above
me
the
sharp
flare
of
a
and
almost
in
the
same
instant
went
out
i
glanced
down
at
the
decks
they
were
filled
with
flickering
grotesque
shadows
cast
by
the
dripping
light
above
a
group
of
the
men
stood
by
the
port
galley
door
their
faces
upturned
and
pale
and
unreal
under
the
gleam
of
the
light
then
i
was
in
the
futtock
rigging
and
a
moment
afterwards
standing
in
the
top
beside
the
old
man
he
was
shouting
to
the
men
who
had
gone
out
on
the
craneline
it
seemed
that
the
man
on
the
port
side
was
bungling
but
at
last
nearly
a
minute
after
the
other
man
had
lit
his
flare
he
got
going
in
that
time
the
man
in
the
top
had
lit
his
second
and
we
were
ready
to
get
into
the
topmast
rigging
first
however
the
skipper
leant
over
the
afterside
of
the
top
and
sung
out
to
the
first
mate
to
send
a
man
up
on
to
the
head
with
a
flare
the
mate
replied
and
then
we
started
again
the
old
man
leading
fortunately
the
rain
had
ceased
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
increase
in
the
wind
indeed
if
anything
there
appeared
to
be
rather
less
yet
what
there
was
drove
the
flames
of
the
out
into
occasional
twisting
serpents
of
fire
at
least
a
yard
long
about
up
the
topmast
rigging
the
second
mate
sung
out
to
the
skipper
to
know
whether
plummer
should
light
his
flare
but
the
old
man
said
he
had
better
wait
until
we
reached
the
crosstrees
as
then
he
could
get
out
away
from
the
gear
to
where
there
would
be
less
danger
of
setting
fire
to
anything
we
neared
the
crosstrees
and
the
old
man
stopped
and
sung
out
to
me
to
pass
him
the
lantern
by
quoin
a
few
ratlines
more
and
both
he
and
the
second
mate
stopped
almost
simultaneously
holding
their
lanterns
as
high
as
possible
and
peered
up
into
the
darkness
see
any
signs
of
him
mr
tulipson
the
old
man
asked
no
sir
replied
the
second
not
a
sign
he
raised
his
voice
stubbins
he
sung
out
stubbins
are
you
there
we
listened
but
nothing
came
to
us
beyond
the
blowing
moan
of
the
wind
and
the
flap
flap
of
the
bellying
above
the
second
mate
climbed
over
the
crosstrees
and
plummer
followed
the
man
got
out
by
the
royal
backstay
and
lit
his
flare
by
its
light
we
could
see
plainly
but
there
was
no
vestige
of
stubbins
so
far
as
the
light
went
get
out
on
to
the
with
those
flares
you
two
men
shouted
the
skipper
be
smart
now
keep
them
away
from
the
sail
the
men
got
on
to
the
quoin
on
the
port
and
jaskett
on
the
starboard
side
by
the
light
from
plummer
flare
i
could
see
them
clearly
as
they
lay
out
upon
the
yard
it
occurred
to
me
that
they
went
gingerly
which
is
no
surprising
thing
and
then
as
they
drew
near
to
the
they
passed
beyond
the
brilliance
of
the
light
so
that
i
could
not
see
them
clearly
a
few
seconds
passed
and
then
the
light
from
quoin
flare
streamed
out
upon
the
wind
yet
nearly
a
minute
went
by
and
there
was
no
sign
of
jaskett
then
out
from
the
at
the
starboard
there
came
a
curse
from
jaskett
followed
almost
immediately
by
a
noise
of
something
vibrating
what
up
shouted
the
second
mate
what
up
jaskett
it
ther
he
drew
out
the
last
word
into
a
sort
of
gasp
the
second
mate
bent
quickly
with
the
lantern
i
craned
round
the
after
side
of
the
and
looked
what
is
the
matter
mr
tulipson
i
heard
the
old
man
singing
out
out
on
the
jaskett
began
to
shout
for
help
and
then
all
at
once
in
the
light
from
the
second
mate
lantern
i
saw
that
the
starboard
on
the
upper
topsail
yard
was
being
violently
shaken
savagely
shaken
is
perhaps
a
better
word
and
then
almost
in
the
same
instant
the
second
mate
shifted
the
lantern
from
his
right
to
his
left
hand
he
put
the
right
into
his
pocket
and
brought
out
his
gun
with
a
jerk
he
extended
his
hand
and
arm
as
though
pointing
at
something
a
little
below
the
yard
then
a
quick
flash
spat
out
across
the
shadows
followed
immediately
by
a
sharp
ringing
crack
in
the
same
moment
i
saw
that
the
ceased
to
shake
light
your
flare
light
your
flare
jaskett
the
second
shouted
be
smart
now
out
at
the
there
came
a
splutter
of
a
match
and
then
straightaway
a
great
spurt
of
fire
as
the
flare
took
light
that
better
jaskett
you
all
right
now
the
second
mate
called
out
to
him
what
was
it
mr
tulipson
i
heard
the
skipper
ask
i
looked
up
and
saw
that
he
had
sprung
across
to
where
the
second
mate
was
standing
the
second
mate
explained
to
him
but
he
did
not
speak
loud
enough
for
me
to
catch
what
he
said
i
had
been
struck
by
jaskett
attitude
when
the
light
of
his
flare
had
first
revealed
him
he
had
been
crouched
with
his
right
knee
cocked
over
the
yard
and
his
left
leg
down
between
it
and
the
while
his
elbows
had
been
crooked
over
the
yard
for
support
as
he
was
lighting
the
flare
now
however
he
had
slid
both
feet
back
on
to
the
and
was
lying
on
his
belly
over
the
yard
with
the
flare
held
a
little
below
the
head
of
the
sail
it
was
thus
with
the
light
being
on
the
foreside
of
the
sail
that
i
saw
a
small
hole
a
little
below
the
through
which
a
ray
of
the
light
shone
it
was
undoubtedly
the
hole
which
the
bullet
from
the
second
mate
revolver
had
made
in
the
sail
then
i
heard
the
old
man
shouting
to
jaskett
be
careful
with
that
flare
there
he
sung
out
you
be
having
that
sail
scorched
he
left
the
second
mate
and
came
back
on
to
the
port
side
of
the
mast
to
my
right
plummer
flares
seemed
to
be
dwindling
i
glanced
up
at
his
face
through
the
smoke
he
was
paying
no
attention
to
it
instead
he
was
staring
up
above
his
head
shove
some
paraffin
on
to
it
plummer
i
called
to
him
it
be
out
in
a
minute
he
looked
down
quickly
to
the
light
and
did
as
i
suggested
then
he
held
it
out
at
arm
length
and
peered
up
again
into
the
darkness
see
anything
asked
the
old
man
suddenly
observing
his
attitude
plummer
glanced
at
him
with
a
start
it
ther
sir
he
explained
it
all
adrift
what
said
the
old
man
he
was
standing
a
few
ratlines
up
the
rigging
and
he
bent
his
body
outwards
to
get
a
better
look
mr
tulipson
he
shouted
do
you
know
that
the
royal
all
adrift
no
sir
answered
the
second
mate
if
it
is
it
more
of
this
devilish
work
it
adrift
right
enough
said
the
skipper
and
he
and
the
second
went
a
few
ratlines
higher
keeping
level
with
one
another
i
had
now
got
above
the
crosstrees
and
was
just
at
the
old
man
heels
suddenly
he
shouted
out
there
he
is
stubbins
stubbins
where
sir
asked
the
second
eagerly
i
ca
see
him
there
there
replied
the
skipper
pointing
i
leant
out
from
the
rigging
and
looked
up
along
his
back
in
the
direction
his
finger
indicated
at
first
i
could
see
nothing
then
slowly
you
know
there
grew
upon
my
sight
a
dim
figure
crouching
upon
the
bunt
of
the
royal
and
partly
hidden
by
the
mast
i
stared
and
gradually
it
came
to
me
that
there
was
a
couple
of
them
and
further
out
upon
the
yard
a
hump
that
might
have
been
anything
and
was
only
visible
indistinctly
amid
the
flutter
of
the
canvas
stubbins
the
skipper
sung
out
stubbins
come
down
out
of
that
do
you
hear
me
but
no
one
came
and
there
was
no
answer
there
two
i
began
but
he
was
shouting
again
come
down
out
of
that
do
you
damned
well
hear
me
still
there
was
no
reply
i
hanged
if
i
can
see
him
at
all
sir
the
second
mate
called
out
from
his
side
of
the
mast
ca
see
him
said
the
old
man
now
thoroughly
angry
i
soon
let
you
see
him
he
bent
down
to
me
with
the
lantern
catch
hold
jessop
he
said
which
i
did
then
he
pulled
the
blue
light
from
his
pocket
and
as
he
was
doing
so
i
saw
the
second
peek
round
the
back
side
of
the
mast
at
him
evidently
in
the
uncertain
light
he
must
have
mistaken
the
skipper
action
for
all
at
once
he
shouted
out
in
a
frightened
voice
do
shoot
sir
for
god
sake
do
shoot
shoot
be
damned
exclaimed
the
old
man
watch
he
pulled
off
the
cap
of
the
light
there
two
of
them
sir
i
called
again
to
him
what
he
said
in
a
loud
voice
and
at
the
same
instant
he
rubbed
the
end
of
the
light
across
the
cap
and
it
burst
into
fire
he
held
it
up
so
that
it
lit
the
royal
yard
like
day
and
straightway
a
couple
of
shapes
dropped
silently
from
the
royal
on
to
the
yard
at
the
same
moment
the
humped
something
midway
out
upon
the
yard
rose
up
it
ran
in
to
the
mast
and
i
lost
sight
of
it
god
i
heard
the
skipper
gasp
and
he
fumbled
in
his
side
pocket
i
saw
the
two
figures
which
had
dropped
on
to
the
run
swiftly
along
the
yard
one
to
the
starboard
and
the
other
to
the
port
on
the
other
side
of
the
mast
the
second
mate
pistol
cracked
out
twice
sharply
then
from
over
my
head
the
skipper
fired
twice
and
then
again
but
with
what
effect
i
could
not
tell
abruptly
as
he
fired
his
last
shot
i
was
aware
of
an
indistinct
something
gliding
down
the
starboard
royal
backstay
it
was
descending
full
upon
plummer
who
all
unconscious
of
the
thing
was
staring
towards
the
yard
look
out
above
you
plummer
i
almost
shrieked
what
where
he
called
and
grabbed
at
the
stay
and
waved
his
flare
excitedly
down
on
the
upper
topsail
yard
quoin
and
jaskett
voices
rose
simultaneously
and
in
the
identical
instant
their
flares
went
out
then
plummer
shouted
and
his
light
went
utterly
there
were
left
only
the
two
lanterns
and
the
held
by
the
skipper
and
that
a
few
seconds
afterwards
finished
and
died
out
the
skipper
and
the
second
mate
were
shouting
to
the
men
upon
the
yard
and
i
heard
them
answer
in
shaky
voices
out
on
the
crosstrees
i
could
see
by
the
light
from
my
lantern
that
plummer
was
holding
in
a
dazed
fashion
to
the
backstay
are
you
all
right
plummer
i
called
yes
he
said
after
a
little
pause
and
then
he
swore
come
in
off
that
yard
you
men
the
skipper
was
singing
out
come
in
come
in
down
on
deck
i
heard
someone
calling
but
could
not
distinguish
the
words
above
me
pistol
in
hand
the
skipper
was
glancing
about
uneasily
hold
up
that
light
jessop
he
said
i
ca
see
below
us
the
men
got
off
the
yard
into
the
rigging
down
on
deck
with
you
ordered
the
old
man
as
smartly
as
you
can
come
in
off
there
plummer
sung
out
the
second
mate
get
down
with
the
others
down
with
you
jessop
said
the
skipper
speaking
rapidly
down
with
you
i
got
over
the
crosstrees
and
he
followed
on
the
other
side
the
second
mate
was
level
with
us
he
had
passed
his
lantern
to
plummer
and
i
caught
the
glint
of
his
revolver
in
his
right
hand
in
this
fashion
we
reached
the
top
the
man
who
had
been
stationed
there
with
the
had
gone
afterwards
i
found
that
he
went
down
on
deck
as
soon
as
they
were
finished
there
was
no
sign
of
the
man
with
the
flare
on
the
starboard
craneline
he
also
i
learnt
later
had
slid
down
one
of
the
backstays
on
to
the
deck
only
a
very
short
while
before
we
reached
the
top
he
swore
that
a
great
black
shadow
of
a
man
had
come
suddenly
upon
him
from
aloft
when
i
heard
that
i
remembered
the
thing
i
had
seen
descending
upon
plummer
yet
the
man
who
had
gone
out
upon
the
port
craneline
the
one
who
had
bungled
with
the
lighting
of
his
flare
was
still
where
we
had
left
him
though
his
light
was
burning
now
but
dimly
come
in
out
of
that
the
old
man
sung
out
smartly
now
and
get
down
on
deck
i
i
sir
the
man
replied
and
started
to
make
his
way
in
the
skipper
waited
until
he
had
got
into
the
main
rigging
and
then
he
told
me
to
get
down
out
of
the
top
he
was
in
the
act
of
following
when
all
at
once
there
rose
a
loud
outcry
on
deck
and
then
came
the
sound
of
a
man
screaming
get
out
of
my
way
jessop
the
skipper
roared
and
swung
himself
down
alongside
of
me
i
heard
the
second
mate
shout
something
from
the
starboard
rigging
then
we
were
all
racing
down
as
hard
as
we
could
go
i
had
caught
a
momentary
glimpse
of
a
man
running
from
the
doorway
on
the
port
side
of
the
in
less
than
half
a
minute
we
were
upon
the
deck
and
among
a
crowd
of
the
men
who
were
grouped
round
something
yet
strangely
enough
they
were
not
looking
at
the
thing
among
them
but
away
aft
at
something
in
the
darkness
it
on
the
rail
cried
several
voices
overboard
called
somebody
in
an
excited
voice
it
jumped
over
the
side
ther
nothin
said
a
man
in
the
crowd
silence
shouted
the
old
man
where
the
mate
what
happened
here
sir
called
the
first
mate
shakily
from
near
the
centre
of
the
group
it
jacobs
sir
he
he
what
said
the
skipper
what
he
he
he
dead
i
think
said
the
first
mate
in
jerks
let
me
see
said
the
old
man
in
a
quieter
tone
the
men
had
stood
to
one
side
to
give
him
room
and
he
knelt
beside
the
man
upon
the
deck
pass
the
lantern
here
jessop
he
said
i
stood
by
him
and
held
the
light
the
man
was
lying
face
downwards
on
the
deck
under
the
light
from
the
lantern
the
skipper
turned
him
over
and
looked
at
him
yes
he
said
after
a
short
examination
he
dead
he
stood
up
and
regarded
the
body
a
moment
in
silence
then
he
turned
to
the
second
mate
who
had
been
standing
by
during
the
last
couple
of
minutes
three
he
said
in
a
grim
undertone
the
second
mate
nodded
and
cleared
his
voice
he
seemed
on
the
point
of
saying
something
then
he
turned
and
looked
at
jacobs
and
said
nothing
three
repeated
the
old
man
since
eight
bells
he
stooped
and
looked
again
at
jacobs
poor
devil
poor
devil
he
muttered
the
second
mate
grunted
some
of
the
huskiness
out
of
his
throat
and
spoke
where
must
we
take
him
he
asked
quietly
the
two
bunks
are
full
you
have
to
put
him
down
on
the
deck
by
the
lower
bunk
replied
the
skipper
as
they
carried
him
away
i
heard
the
old
man
make
a
sound
that
was
almost
a
groan
the
rest
of
the
men
had
gone
forrard
and
i
do
not
think
he
realised
that
i
was
standing
by
him
my
god
o
my
god
he
muttered
and
began
to
walk
slowly
aft
he
had
cause
enough
for
groaning
there
were
three
dead
and
stubbins
had
gone
utterly
and
completely
we
never
saw
him
again
xii
a
few
minutes
later
the
second
mate
came
forrard
again
i
was
still
standing
near
the
rigging
holding
the
lantern
in
an
aimless
sort
of
way
that
you
plummer
he
asked
no
sir
i
said
it
jessop
where
plummer
then
he
inquired
i
do
know
sir
i
answered
i
expect
he
gone
forrard
shall
i
go
and
tell
him
you
want
him
no
there
no
need
he
said
tie
your
lamp
up
in
the
rigging
on
the
sheerpole
there
then
go
and
get
his
and
shove
it
up
on
the
starboard
side
after
that
you
better
go
aft
and
give
the
two
a
hand
in
the
lamp
locker
i
i
sir
i
replied
and
proceeded
to
do
as
he
directed
after
i
had
got
the
light
from
plummer
and
lashed
it
up
to
the
starboard
sherpole
i
hurried
aft
i
found
tammy
and
the
other
in
our
watch
busy
in
the
locker
lighting
lamps
what
are
we
doing
i
asked
the
old
man
given
orders
to
lash
all
the
spare
lamps
we
can
find
in
the
rigging
so
as
to
have
the
decks
light
said
tammy
and
a
damned
good
job
too
he
handed
me
a
couple
of
the
lamps
and
took
two
himself
come
on
he
said
and
stepped
out
on
deck
we
fix
these
in
the
main
rigging
and
then
i
want
to
talk
to
you
what
about
the
mizzen
i
inquired
oh
he
replied
he
meaning
the
other
will
see
to
that
anyway
it
be
daylight
directly
we
shoved
the
lamps
up
on
the
sherpoles
two
on
each
side
then
he
came
across
to
me
look
here
jessop
he
said
without
any
hesitation
you
have
to
jolly
well
tell
the
skipper
and
the
second
mate
all
you
know
about
all
this
how
do
you
mean
i
asked
why
that
it
something
about
the
ship
herself
that
the
cause
of
what
happened
he
replied
if
you
only
explained
to
the
second
mate
when
i
told
you
to
this
might
never
have
been
but
i
do
i
said
i
may
be
all
wrong
it
only
an
idea
of
mine
i
no
proofs
proofs
he
cut
in
with
proofs
what
about
tonight
we
had
all
the
proofs
ever
i
want
i
hesitated
before
answering
him
so
have
i
for
that
matter
i
said
at
length
what
i
mean
is
nothing
that
the
skipper
and
the
second
mate
would
consider
as
proofs
they
never
listen
seriously
to
me
they
listen
fast
enough
he
replied
after
what
happened
this
watch
they
listen
to
anything
anyway
it
jolly
well
your
duty
to
tell
them
what
could
they
do
anyway
i
said
despondently
as
things
are
going
we
all
be
dead
before
another
week
is
over
at
this
rate
you
tell
them
he
answered
that
what
you
got
to
do
if
you
can
only
get
them
to
realise
that
you
right
they
be
glad
to
put
into
the
nearest
port
and
send
us
all
ashore
i
shook
my
head
well
anyway
they
have
to
do
something
he
replied
in
answer
to
my
gesture
we
ca
go
round
the
horn
with
the
number
of
men
lost
we
have
enough
to
handle
her
if
it
comes
on
to
blow
you
forgotten
tammy
i
said
even
if
i
could
get
the
old
man
to
believe
i
got
at
the
truth
of
the
matter
he
could
do
anything
do
you
see
if
i
right
we
could
even
see
the
land
if
we
made
it
we
like
blind
men
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
he
interrupted
how
do
you
make
out
like
blind
men
of
course
we
could
see
the
land
wait
a
minute
wait
a
minute
i
said
you
do
understand
did
i
tell
you
tell
what
he
asked
about
the
ship
i
spotted
i
said
i
thought
you
knew
no
he
said
when
why
i
replied
you
know
when
the
old
man
sent
me
away
from
the
wheel
yes
he
answered
you
mean
in
the
morning
watch
day
before
yesterday
yes
i
said
well
do
you
know
what
was
the
matter
no
he
replied
that
is
i
heard
you
were
snoozing
at
the
wheel
and
the
old
man
came
up
and
caught
you
that
all
a
darned
silly
yarn
i
said
and
then
i
told
him
the
whole
truth
of
the
affair
after
i
had
done
that
i
explained
my
idea
about
it
to
him
now
you
see
what
i
mean
i
asked
you
mean
that
this
strange
atmosphere
or
whatever
it
is
we
in
would
not
allow
us
to
see
another
ship
he
asked
a
bit
awestruck
yes
i
said
but
the
point
i
wanted
you
to
see
is
that
if
we
see
another
vessel
even
when
she
quite
close
then
in
the
same
way
we
should
be
able
to
see
land
to
all
intents
and
purposes
blind
just
you
think
of
it
we
out
in
the
middle
of
the
briny
doing
a
sort
of
eternal
blind
man
hop
the
old
man
could
put
into
port
even
if
he
wanted
to
he
run
us
bang
on
shore
without
our
ever
seeing
it
what
are
we
going
to
do
then
he
asked
in
a
despairing
sort
of
way
do
you
mean
to
say
we
ca
do
anything
surely
something
can
be
done
it
terrible
for
perhaps
a
minute
we
walked
up
and
down
in
the
light
from
the
different
lanterns
then
he
spoke
again
we
might
be
run
down
then
he
said
and
never
even
see
the
other
vessel
it
possible
i
replied
though
from
what
i
saw
it
evident
that
quite
visible
so
that
it
would
be
easy
for
them
to
see
us
and
steer
clear
of
us
even
though
we
could
see
them
and
we
might
run
into
something
and
never
see
it
he
asked
me
following
up
the
train
of
thought
yes
i
said
only
there
nothing
to
stop
the
other
ship
from
getting
out
of
our
way
but
if
it
was
a
vessel
he
persisted
it
might
be
an
iceberg
or
a
rock
or
even
a
derelict
in
that
case
i
said
putting
it
a
bit
flippantly
naturally
probably
damage
it
he
made
no
answer
to
this
and
for
a
few
moments
we
were
quiet
then
he
spoke
abruptly
as
though
the
idea
had
come
suddenly
to
him
those
lights
the
other
night
he
said
were
they
a
ship
lights
yes
i
replied
why
why
he
answered
do
you
see
if
they
were
really
lights
we
see
them
well
i
should
think
i
ought
to
know
that
i
replied
you
seem
to
forget
that
the
second
mate
slung
me
off
the
for
daring
to
do
that
very
thing
i
do
mean
that
he
said
do
you
see
that
if
we
could
see
them
at
all
it
showed
that
the
was
round
us
then
not
necessarily
i
answered
it
may
have
been
nothing
more
than
a
rift
in
it
though
of
course
i
may
be
all
wrong
but
anyway
the
fact
that
the
lights
disappeared
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
seen
shows
that
it
was
very
much
round
the
ship
that
made
him
feel
a
bit
the
way
i
did
and
when
next
he
spoke
his
tone
had
lost
its
hopefulness
then
you
think
it
be
no
use
telling
the
second
mate
and
the
skipper
anything
he
asked
i
do
know
i
replied
i
been
thinking
about
it
and
it
ca
do
any
harm
i
a
very
good
mind
to
i
should
he
said
you
need
be
afraid
of
anybody
laughing
at
you
now
it
might
do
some
good
you
seen
more
than
anyone
else
he
stopped
in
his
walk
and
looked
round
wait
a
minute
he
said
and
ran
aft
a
few
steps
i
saw
him
look
up
at
the
break
of
the
poop
then
he
came
back
come
along
now
he
said
the
old
man
up
on
the
poop
talking
to
the
second
mate
you
never
get
a
better
chance
still
i
hesitated
but
he
caught
me
by
the
sleeve
and
almost
dragged
me
to
the
lee
ladder
all
right
i
said
when
i
got
there
all
right
i
come
only
hanged
if
i
know
what
to
say
when
i
get
there
just
tell
them
you
want
to
speak
to
them
he
said
they
ask
what
you
want
and
then
you
spit
out
all
you
know
they
find
it
interesting
enough
you
better
come
too
i
suggested
you
be
able
to
back
me
up
in
lots
of
things
i
come
fast
enough
he
replied
you
go
up
i
went
up
the
ladder
and
walked
across
to
where
the
skipper
and
the
second
mate
stood
talking
earnestly
by
the
rail
tammy
kept
behind
as
i
came
near
to
them
i
caught
two
or
three
words
though
i
attached
no
meaning
then
to
them
they
were
send
for
him
then
the
two
of
them
turned
and
looked
at
me
and
the
second
mate
asked
what
i
wanted
i
want
to
speak
to
you
and
the
old
m
captain
sir
i
answered
what
is
it
jessop
the
skipper
inquired
i
scarcely
know
how
to
put
it
sir
i
said
it
it
about
these
these
things
what
things
speak
out
man
he
said
well
sir
i
blurted
out
there
some
dreadful
thing
or
things
come
aboard
this
ship
since
we
left
port
i
saw
him
give
one
quick
glance
at
the
second
mate
and
the
second
looked
back
then
the
skipper
replied
how
do
you
mean
come
aboard
he
asked
out
of
the
sea
sir
i
said
i
seen
them
so
tammy
here
ah
he
exclaimed
and
it
seemed
to
me
from
his
face
that
he
was
understanding
something
better
out
of
the
sea
again
he
looked
at
the
second
mate
but
the
second
was
staring
at
me
yes
sir
i
said
it
the
she
not
safe
i
watched
i
think
i
understand
a
bit
but
there
a
lot
i
do
i
stopped
the
skipper
had
turned
to
the
second
mate
the
second
nodded
gravely
then
i
heard
him
mutter
in
a
low
voice
and
the
old
man
replied
after
which
he
turned
to
me
again
look
here
jessop
he
said
i
going
to
talk
straight
to
you
you
strike
me
as
being
a
cut
above
the
ordinary
shellback
and
i
think
you
sense
enough
to
hold
your
tongue
i
got
my
mate
ticket
sir
i
said
simply
behind
me
i
heard
tammy
give
a
little
start
he
had
not
known
about
it
until
then
the
skipper
nodded
so
much
the
better
he
answered
i
may
have
to
speak
to
you
about
that
later
on
he
paused
and
the
second
mate
said
something
to
him
in
an
undertone
yes
he
said
as
though
in
reply
to
what
the
second
had
been
saying
then
he
spoke
to
me
again
you
seen
things
come
out
of
the
sea
you
say
he
questioned
now
just
tell
me
all
you
can
remember
from
the
very
beginning
i
set
to
and
told
him
everything
in
detail
commencing
with
the
strange
figure
that
had
stepped
aboard
out
of
the
sea
and
continuing
my
yarn
up
to
the
things
that
had
happened
in
that
very
watch
i
stuck
well
to
solid
facts
and
now
and
then
he
and
the
second
mate
would
look
at
one
another
and
nod
at
the
end
he
turned
to
me
with
an
abrupt
gesture
you
still
hold
then
that
you
saw
a
ship
the
other
morning
when
i
sent
you
from
the
wheel
he
asked
yes
sir
i
said
i
most
certainly
do
but
you
knew
there
was
any
he
said
yes
sir
i
replied
in
an
apologetic
tone
there
was
and
if
you
will
let
me
i
believe
that
i
can
explain
it
a
bit
well
he
said
go
on
now
that
i
knew
he
was
willing
to
listen
to
me
in
a
serious
manner
all
my
funk
of
telling
him
had
gone
and
i
went
ahead
and
told
him
my
ideas
about
the
mist
and
the
thing
it
seemed
to
have
ushered
you
know
i
finished
up
by
telling
him
how
tammy
had
worried
me
to
come
and
tell
what
i
knew
he
thought
then
sir
i
went
on
that
you
might
wish
to
put
into
the
nearest
port
but
i
told
him
that
i
did
think
you
could
even
if
you
wanted
to
how
that
he
asked
profoundly
interested
well
sir
i
replied
if
we
unable
to
see
other
vessels
we
should
be
able
to
see
the
land
you
be
piling
the
ship
up
without
ever
seeing
where
you
were
putting
her
this
view
of
the
matter
affected
the
old
man
in
an
extraordinary
manner
as
it
did
i
believe
the
second
mate
and
neither
spoke
for
a
moment
then
the
skipper
burst
out
by
gad
jessop
he
said
if
you
right
the
lord
have
mercy
on
us
he
thought
for
a
couple
of
seconds
then
he
spoke
again
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
pretty
well
twisted
up
my
god
if
you
right
the
second
mate
spoke
the
men
must
know
sir
he
warned
him
it
be
a
mess
if
they
did
yes
said
the
old
man
he
spoke
to
me
remember
that
jessop
he
said
whatever
you
do
do
go
yarning
about
this
forrard
no
sir
i
replied
and
you
too
boy
said
the
skipper
keep
your
tongue
between
your
teeth
we
in
a
bad
enough
mess
without
your
making
it
worse
do
you
hear
yes
sir
answered
tammy
the
old
man
turned
to
me
again
these
things
or
creatures
that
you
say
come
out
of
the
sea
he
said
you
never
seen
them
except
after
nightfall
he
asked
no
sir
i
replied
never
he
turned
to
the
second
mate
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
tulipson
he
remarked
the
danger
seems
to
be
only
at
night
it
always
been
at
night
sir
the
second
answered
the
old
man
nodded
have
you
anything
to
propose
mr
tulipson
he
asked
well
sir
replied
the
second
mate
i
think
you
ought
to
have
her
snugged
down
every
night
before
dark
he
spoke
with
considerable
emphasis
then
he
glanced
aloft
and
jerked
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
unfurled
it
a
damned
good
thing
sir
he
said
that
it
did
come
on
to
blow
any
harder
the
old
man
nodded
again
yes
he
remarked
we
shall
have
to
do
it
but
god
knows
when
get
home
better
late
than
not
at
all
i
heard
the
second
mutter
under
his
breath
out
loud
he
said
and
the
lights
sir
yes
said
the
old
man
i
will
have
lamps
in
the
rigging
every
night
after
dark
very
good
sir
assented
the
second
then
he
turned
to
us
it
getting
daylight
jessop
he
remarked
with
a
glance
at
the
sky
you
better
take
tammy
with
you
and
shove
those
lamps
back
again
into
the
locker
i
i
sir
i
said
and
went
down
off
the
poop
with
tammy
xiii
shadow
in
the
when
eight
bells
went
at
four
and
the
other
watch
came
on
deck
to
relieve
us
it
had
been
broad
daylight
for
some
time
before
we
went
below
the
second
mate
had
the
three
set
and
now
that
it
was
light
we
were
pretty
curious
to
have
a
look
aloft
especially
up
the
fore
and
tom
who
had
been
up
to
overhaul
the
gear
was
questioned
a
lot
when
he
came
down
as
to
whether
there
were
any
signs
of
anything
queer
up
there
but
he
told
us
there
was
nothing
unusual
to
be
seen
at
eight
when
we
came
on
deck
for
the
eight
to
twelve
watch
i
saw
the
sailmaker
coming
forrard
along
the
deck
from
the
second
old
berth
he
had
his
rule
in
his
hand
and
i
knew
he
had
been
measuring
the
poor
beggars
in
there
for
their
burial
outfit
from
breakfast
time
until
near
noon
he
worked
shaping
out
three
canvas
wrappers
from
some
old
sailcloth
then
with
the
aid
of
the
second
mate
and
one
of
the
hands
he
brought
out
the
three
dead
chaps
on
to
the
after
hatch
and
there
sewed
them
up
with
a
few
lumps
of
holy
stone
at
their
feet
he
was
just
finishing
when
eight
bells
went
and
i
heard
the
old
man
tell
the
second
mate
to
call
all
hands
aft
for
the
burial
this
was
done
and
one
of
the
gangways
unshipped
we
had
no
decent
grating
big
enough
so
they
had
to
get
off
one
of
the
hatches
and
use
it
instead
the
wind
had
died
away
during
the
morning
and
the
sea
was
almost
a
calm
the
ship
lifting
ever
so
slightly
to
an
occasional
glassy
heave
the
only
sounds
that
struck
on
the
ear
were
the
soft
slow
rustle
and
occasional
shiver
of
the
sails
and
the
continuous
and
monotonous
creak
creak
of
the
spars
and
gear
at
the
gentle
movements
of
the
vessel
and
it
was
in
this
solemn
that
the
skipper
read
the
burial
service
they
had
put
the
dutchman
first
upon
the
hatch
i
could
tell
him
by
his
stumpiness
and
when
at
last
the
old
man
gave
the
signal
the
second
mate
tilted
his
end
and
he
slid
off
and
down
into
the
dark
poor
old
dutchie
i
heard
one
of
the
men
say
and
i
fancy
we
all
felt
a
bit
like
that
then
they
lifted
jacobs
on
to
the
hatch
and
when
he
had
gone
jock
when
jock
was
lifted
a
sort
of
sudden
shiver
ran
through
the
crowd
he
had
been
a
favourite
in
a
quiet
way
and
i
know
i
felt
all
at
once
just
a
bit
queer
i
was
standing
by
the
rail
upon
the
after
bollard
and
tammy
was
next
to
me
while
plummer
stood
a
little
behind
as
the
second
mate
tilted
the
hatch
for
the
last
time
a
little
hoarse
chorus
broke
from
the
men
jock
so
long
jock
and
then
at
the
sudden
plunge
they
rushed
to
the
side
to
see
the
last
of
him
as
he
went
downwards
even
the
second
mate
was
not
able
to
resist
this
universal
feeling
and
he
too
peered
over
from
where
i
had
been
standing
i
had
been
able
to
see
the
body
take
the
water
and
now
for
a
brief
couple
of
seconds
i
saw
the
white
of
the
canvas
blurred
by
the
blue
of
the
water
dwindle
and
dwindle
in
the
extreme
depth
abruptly
as
i
stared
it
disappeared
too
abruptly
it
seemed
to
me
gone
i
heard
several
voices
say
and
then
our
watch
began
to
go
slowly
forrard
while
one
or
two
of
the
other
started
to
replace
the
hatch
tammy
pointed
and
nudged
me
see
jessop
he
said
what
is
it
what
i
asked
that
queer
shadow
he
replied
look
and
then
i
saw
what
he
meant
it
was
something
big
and
shadowy
that
appeared
to
be
growing
clearer
it
occupied
the
exact
place
so
it
seemed
to
me
in
which
jock
had
disappeared
look
at
it
said
tammy
again
it
getting
bigger
he
was
pretty
excited
and
so
was
i
was
peering
down
the
thing
seemed
to
be
rising
out
of
the
depths
it
was
taking
shape
as
i
realised
what
the
shape
was
a
queer
cold
funk
took
me
see
said
tammy
it
just
like
the
shadow
of
a
ship
and
it
was
the
shadow
of
a
ship
rising
out
of
the
unexplored
immensity
beneath
our
keel
plummer
who
had
not
yet
gone
forrard
caught
last
remark
and
glanced
over
what
mean
he
asked
that
replied
tammy
and
pointed
i
jabbed
my
elbow
into
his
ribs
but
it
was
too
late
plummer
had
seen
curiously
enough
though
he
seemed
to
think
nothing
of
it
that
ai
nothin
ther
shadder
er
ther
ship
he
said
tammy
after
my
hint
let
it
go
at
that
but
when
plummer
had
gone
forrard
with
the
others
i
told
him
not
to
go
telling
everything
round
the
decks
like
that
we
got
to
be
thundering
careful
i
remarked
you
know
what
the
old
man
said
last
watch
yes
said
tammy
i
was
thinking
i
be
careful
next
time
a
little
way
from
me
the
second
mate
was
still
staring
down
into
the
water
i
turned
and
spoke
to
him
what
do
you
make
it
out
to
be
sir
i
asked
god
knows
he
said
with
a
quick
glance
round
to
see
whether
any
of
the
men
were
about
he
got
down
from
the
rail
and
turned
to
go
up
on
to
the
poop
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
he
leant
over
the
break
you
may
as
well
ship
that
gangway
you
two
he
told
us
and
mind
jessop
keep
your
mouth
shut
about
this
i
i
sir
i
answered
and
you
too
youngster
he
added
and
went
aft
along
the
poop
tammy
and
i
were
busy
with
the
gangway
when
the
second
came
back
he
had
brought
the
skipper
right
under
the
gangway
sir
i
heard
the
second
say
and
he
pointed
down
into
the
water
for
a
little
while
the
old
man
stared
then
i
heard
him
speak
i
do
see
anything
he
said
at
that
the
second
mate
bent
more
forward
and
peered
down
so
did
i
but
the
thing
whatever
it
was
had
gone
completely
it
gone
sir
said
the
second
it
was
there
right
enough
when
i
came
for
you
about
a
minute
later
having
finished
shipping
the
gangway
i
was
going
forrard
when
the
second
voice
called
me
back
tell
the
captain
what
it
was
you
saw
just
now
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
ca
say
exactly
sir
i
replied
but
it
seemed
to
me
like
the
shadow
of
a
ship
rising
up
through
the
water
there
sir
remarked
the
second
mate
to
the
old
man
just
what
i
told
you
the
skipper
stared
at
me
you
quite
sure
he
asked
yes
sir
i
answered
tammy
saw
it
too
i
waited
a
minute
then
they
turned
to
go
aft
the
second
was
saying
something
can
i
go
sir
i
asked
yes
that
will
do
jessop
he
said
over
his
shoulder
but
the
old
man
came
back
to
the
break
and
spoke
to
me
remember
not
a
word
of
this
forrard
he
said
no
sir
i
replied
and
he
went
back
to
the
second
mate
while
i
walked
forrard
to
the
to
get
something
to
eat
your
whack
in
the
kettle
jessop
said
tom
as
i
stepped
in
over
the
washboard
an
i
got
your
in
a
pannikin
thanks
i
said
and
sat
down
as
i
stowed
away
my
grub
i
took
no
notice
of
the
chatter
of
the
others
i
was
too
stuffed
with
my
own
thoughts
that
shadow
of
a
vessel
rising
you
know
out
of
the
profound
deeps
had
impressed
me
tremendously
it
had
not
been
imagination
three
of
us
had
seen
it
really
four
for
plummer
distinctly
saw
it
though
he
failed
to
recognise
it
as
anything
extraordinary
as
you
can
understand
i
thought
a
lot
about
this
shadow
of
a
vessel
but
i
am
sure
for
a
time
my
ideas
must
just
have
gone
in
an
everlasting
blind
circle
and
then
i
got
another
thought
for
i
got
thinking
of
the
figures
i
had
seen
aloft
in
the
early
morning
and
i
began
to
imagine
fresh
things
you
see
that
first
thing
that
had
come
up
over
the
side
had
come
of
the
and
it
had
gone
back
and
now
there
was
this
shadow
i
called
it
it
was
a
damned
good
name
too
and
the
dark
noiseless
men
i
thought
a
lot
on
these
lines
unconsciously
i
put
a
question
to
myself
aloud
were
they
the
crew
eh
said
jaskett
who
was
on
the
next
chest
i
took
hold
of
myself
as
it
were
and
glanced
at
him
in
an
apparently
careless
manner
did
i
speak
i
asked
yes
mate
he
replied
eyeing
me
curiously
yer
said
sumthin
about
a
crew
i
must
have
been
dreaming
i
said
and
rose
up
to
put
away
my
plate
xiv
ghost
at
four
when
again
we
went
on
deck
the
second
mate
told
me
to
go
on
with
a
paunch
mat
i
was
making
while
tammy
he
sent
to
get
out
his
sinnet
i
had
the
mat
slug
on
the
fore
side
of
the
mainmast
between
it
and
the
after
end
of
the
house
and
in
a
few
minutes
tammy
brought
his
sinnet
and
yarns
to
the
mast
and
made
fast
to
one
of
the
pins
what
do
you
think
it
was
jessop
he
asked
abruptly
after
a
short
silence
i
looked
at
him
what
do
you
think
i
replied
i
do
know
what
to
think
he
said
but
i
a
feeling
that
something
to
do
with
all
the
rest
and
he
indicated
aloft
with
his
head
i
been
thinking
too
i
remarked
that
it
is
he
inquired
yes
i
answered
and
told
him
how
the
idea
had
come
to
me
at
my
dinner
that
the
strange
which
came
aboard
might
come
from
that
indistinct
vessel
we
had
seen
down
in
the
sea
good
lord
he
exclaimed
as
he
got
my
meaning
and
then
for
a
little
he
stood
and
thought
that
where
they
live
you
mean
he
said
at
last
and
paused
again
well
i
replied
it
ca
be
the
sort
of
existence
should
call
life
he
nodded
doubtfully
no
he
said
and
was
silent
again
presently
he
put
out
an
idea
that
had
come
to
him
you
then
that
that
vessel
has
been
with
us
for
some
time
if
we
only
known
he
asked
all
along
i
replied
i
mean
ever
since
these
things
started
supposing
there
are
others
he
said
suddenly
i
looked
at
him
if
there
are
i
said
you
can
pray
to
god
that
they
wo
stumble
across
us
it
strikes
me
that
whether
they
ghosts
or
not
ghosts
they
pirates
it
seems
horrible
he
said
solemnly
to
be
talking
seriously
like
this
about
you
know
about
such
things
i
tried
to
stop
thinking
that
way
i
told
him
i
felt
i
should
go
cracked
if
i
did
there
damned
queer
things
happen
at
sea
i
know
but
this
is
one
of
them
it
seems
so
strange
and
unreal
one
moment
does
it
he
said
and
the
next
you
it
really
true
and
you
ca
understand
why
you
did
always
know
and
yet
they
never
believe
if
you
told
them
ashore
about
it
they
believe
if
they
been
in
this
packet
in
the
middle
watch
this
morning
i
said
besides
i
went
on
they
do
understand
we
did
i
shall
always
feel
different
now
when
i
read
that
some
packet
has
been
heard
of
tammy
stared
at
me
i
heard
some
of
the
old
shellbacks
talking
about
things
he
said
but
i
never
took
them
really
seriously
well
i
said
i
guess
we
have
to
take
this
seriously
i
wish
to
god
we
were
home
my
god
so
do
i
he
said
for
a
good
while
after
that
we
both
worked
on
in
silence
but
presently
he
went
off
on
another
tack
do
you
think
we
really
shorten
her
down
every
night
before
it
gets
dark
he
asked
certainly
i
replied
they
never
get
the
men
to
go
aloft
at
night
after
what
happened
but
but
supposing
they
us
aloft
he
began
would
you
go
i
interrupted
no
he
said
emphatically
i
jolly
well
be
put
in
irons
first
that
settles
it
then
i
replied
you
would
go
nor
would
any
one
else
at
this
moment
the
second
mate
came
along
shove
that
mat
and
that
sinnet
away
you
two
he
said
then
get
your
brooms
and
clear
up
i
i
sir
we
said
and
he
went
on
forrard
jump
on
the
house
tammy
i
said
and
let
go
the
other
end
of
this
rope
will
you
right
he
said
and
did
as
i
had
asked
him
when
he
came
back
i
got
him
to
give
me
a
hand
to
roll
up
the
mat
which
was
a
very
large
one
i
finish
stopping
it
i
said
you
go
and
put
your
sinnet
away
wait
a
minute
he
replied
and
gathered
up
a
double
handful
of
shakins
from
the
deck
under
where
i
had
been
working
then
he
ran
to
the
side
here
i
said
do
go
dumping
those
they
only
float
and
the
second
mate
or
the
skipper
will
be
sure
to
spot
them
come
here
jessop
he
interrupted
in
a
low
voice
and
taking
no
notice
of
what
i
had
been
saying
i
got
up
off
the
hatch
where
i
was
kneeling
he
was
staring
over
the
side
what
up
i
asked
for
god
sake
hurry
he
said
and
i
ran
and
jumped
on
to
the
spar
alongside
of
him
look
he
said
and
pointed
with
a
handful
of
shakins
right
down
directly
beneath
us
some
of
the
shakins
dropped
from
his
hand
and
blurred
the
water
momentarily
so
that
i
could
not
see
then
as
the
ripples
cleared
away
i
saw
what
he
meant
two
of
them
he
said
in
a
voice
that
was
scarcely
above
a
whisper
and
there
another
out
there
and
he
pointed
again
with
the
handful
of
shakins
there
another
a
little
further
aft
i
muttered
where
where
he
asked
there
i
said
and
pointed
that
four
he
whispered
four
of
them
i
said
nothing
but
continued
to
stare
they
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
great
way
down
in
the
sea
and
quite
motionless
yet
though
their
outlines
were
somewhat
blurred
and
indistinct
there
was
no
mistaking
that
they
were
very
like
exact
though
shadowy
representations
of
vessels
for
some
minutes
we
watched
them
without
speaking
at
last
tammy
spoke
they
real
right
enough
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
do
know
i
answered
i
mean
we
were
mistaken
this
morning
he
said
no
i
replied
i
never
thought
we
were
away
forrard
i
heard
the
second
mate
returning
aft
he
came
nearer
and
saw
us
what
up
now
you
two
he
called
sharply
this
is
clearing
up
i
put
out
my
hand
to
warn
him
not
to
shout
and
draw
the
attention
of
the
rest
of
the
men
he
took
several
steps
towards
me
what
is
it
what
is
it
he
said
with
a
certain
irritability
but
in
a
lower
voice
you
better
take
a
look
over
the
side
sir
i
replied
my
tone
must
have
given
him
an
inkling
that
we
had
discovered
something
fresh
for
at
my
words
he
made
one
spring
and
stood
on
the
spar
alongside
of
me
look
sir
said
tammy
there
four
of
them
the
second
mate
glanced
down
saw
something
and
bent
sharply
forward
my
god
i
heard
him
mutter
under
his
breath
after
that
for
some
he
stared
without
a
word
there
are
two
more
out
there
sir
i
told
him
and
indicated
the
place
with
my
finger
it
was
a
little
time
before
he
managed
to
locate
these
and
when
he
did
he
gave
them
only
a
short
glance
then
he
got
down
off
the
spar
and
spoke
to
us
come
down
off
there
he
said
quickly
get
your
brooms
and
clear
up
do
say
a
word
it
may
be
nothing
he
appeared
to
add
that
last
bit
as
an
afterthought
and
we
both
knew
it
meant
nothing
then
he
turned
and
went
swiftly
aft
i
expect
he
gone
to
tell
the
old
man
tammy
remarked
as
we
went
forrard
carrying
the
mat
and
his
sinnet
h
i
said
scarcely
noticing
what
he
was
saying
for
i
was
full
of
the
thought
of
those
four
shadowy
craft
waiting
quietly
down
there
we
got
our
brooms
and
went
aft
on
the
way
the
second
mate
and
the
skipper
passed
us
they
went
forrard
too
by
the
fore
brace
and
got
up
on
the
spar
i
saw
the
second
point
up
at
the
brace
and
he
appeared
to
be
saying
something
about
the
gear
i
guessed
that
this
was
done
purposely
to
act
as
a
blind
should
any
of
the
other
men
be
looking
then
the
old
man
glanced
down
over
the
side
in
a
casual
sort
of
manner
so
did
the
second
mate
a
minute
or
two
later
they
came
aft
and
went
back
up
on
to
the
poop
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
skipper
face
as
he
passed
me
on
his
return
he
struck
me
as
looking
worried
bewildered
perhaps
would
be
a
better
word
both
tammy
and
i
were
tremendously
keen
to
have
another
look
but
when
at
last
we
got
a
chance
the
sky
reflected
so
much
on
the
water
we
could
see
nothing
below
we
had
just
finished
sweeping
up
when
four
bells
went
and
we
cleared
below
for
tea
some
of
the
men
got
chatting
while
they
were
grubbing
i
remarked
quoin
as
we
goin
ter
shorten
down
afore
dark
eh
said
old
jaskett
over
his
pannikin
of
tea
quoin

his
remark

so
inquired
plummer

it
from
ther
doc
answered
quoin
got
it
from
ther
stooard

asked
plummer
i
dunno
said
quoin
i
talkin
it
arft
plummer
turned
to
me
you
anythin
jessop
he
inquired
what
about
shortening
down
i
replied
yes
he
said
were
ther
old
man
talkin
ter
yer
up
on
ther
poop
this
mornin
yes
i
answered
he
said
something
to
the
second
mate
about
shortening
down
but
it
was
to
me
they
are
said
quoin
i
just
said
so
at
that
instant
one
of
the
chaps
in
the
other
watch
poked
his
head
in
through
the
starboard
doorway
all
hands
shorten
sail
he
sung
out
at
the
same
moment
the
whistle
came
sharp
along
the
decks
plummer
stood
up
and
reached
for
his
cap
well
he
said
it
evydent
they
ai
goin
ter
lose
no
more
of
us
then
we
went
out
on
deck
it
was
a
dead
calm
but
all
the
same
we
furled
the
three
royals
and
then
the
three
after
that
we
hauled
up
the
main
and
foresail
and
stowed
them
the
crossjack
of
course
had
been
furled
some
time
with
the
wind
being
plumb
aft
it
was
while
we
were
up
at
the
foresail
that
the
sun
went
over
the
edge
of
the
horizon
we
had
finished
stowing
the
sail
out
upon
the
yard
and
i
was
waiting
for
the
others
to
clear
in
and
let
me
get
off
the
thus
it
happened
that
having
nothing
to
do
for
nearly
a
minute
i
stood
watching
the
sun
set
and
so
saw
something
that
otherwise
i
should
most
probably
have
missed
the
sun
had
dipped
nearly
below
the
horizon
and
was
showing
like
a
great
red
dome
of
dull
fire
abruptly
far
away
on
the
starboard
bow
a
faint
mist
drove
up
out
of
the
sea
it
spread
across
the
face
of
the
sun
so
that
its
light
shone
now
as
though
it
came
through
a
dim
haze
of
smoke
quickly
this
mist
or
haze
grew
thicker
but
at
the
same
time
separating
and
taking
strange
shapes
so
that
the
red
of
the
sun
struck
through
ruddily
between
them
then
as
i
watched
the
weird
mistiness
collected
and
shaped
and
rose
into
three
towers
these
became
more
definite
and
there
was
something
elongated
beneath
them
the
shaping
and
forming
continued
and
almost
suddenly
i
saw
that
the
thing
had
taken
on
the
shape
of
a
great
ship
directly
afterwards
i
saw
that
it
was
moving
it
had
been
broadside
on
to
the
sun
now
it
was
swinging
the
bows
came
round
with
a
stately
movement
until
the
three
masts
bore
in
a
line
it
was
heading
directly
towards
us
it
grew
larger
but
yet
less
distinct
astern
of
it
i
saw
now
that
the
sun
had
sunk
to
a
mere
line
of
light
then
in
the
gathering
dusk
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
ship
was
sinking
back
into
the
ocean
the
sun
went
beneath
the
sea
and
the
thing
i
had
seen
became
merged
as
it
were
into
the
monotonous
greyness
of
the
coming
night
a
voice
came
to
me
from
the
rigging
it
was
the
second
mate
he
had
been
up
to
give
us
a
hand
now
then
jessop
he
was
saying
come
along
come
along
i
turned
quickly
and
realised
that
the
fellows
were
nearly
all
off
the
yard
i
i
sir
i
muttered
and
slid
in
along
the
and
went
down
on
deck
i
felt
fresh
dazed
and
frightened
a
little
later
eight
bells
went
and
after
roll
call
i
cleared
up
on
to
the
poop
to
relieve
the
wheel
for
a
while
as
i
stood
at
the
wheel
my
mind
seemed
blank
and
incapable
of
receiving
impressions
this
sensation
went
after
a
time
and
i
realised
that
there
was
a
great
stillness
over
the
sea
there
was
absolutely
no
wind
and
even
the
everlasting
creak
creak
of
the
gear
seemed
to
ease
off
at
times
at
the
wheel
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
do
i
might
just
as
well
have
been
forrard
smoking
in
the
down
on
the
i
could
see
the
loom
of
the
lanterns
that
had
been
lashed
up
to
the
sherpoles
in
the
fore
and
main
rigging
yet
they
showed
less
than
they
might
owing
to
the
fact
that
they
had
been
shaded
on
their
after
sides
so
as
not
to
blind
the
officer
of
the
watch
more
than
need
be
the
night
had
come
down
strangely
dark
and
yet
of
the
dark
and
the
stillness
and
the
lanterns
i
was
only
conscious
in
occasional
flashes
of
comprehension
for
now
that
my
mind
was
working
i
was
thinking
chiefly
of
that
queer
vast
phantom
of
mist
i
had
seen
rise
from
the
sea
and
take
shape
i
kept
staring
into
the
night
towards
the
west
and
then
all
round
me
for
naturally
the
memory
predominated
that
she
had
been
coming
towards
us
when
the
darkness
came
and
it
was
a
pretty
disquieting
sort
of
thing
to
think
about
i
had
such
a
horrible
feeling
that
something
beastly
was
going
to
happen
any
minute
yet
two
bells
came
and
went
and
still
all
was
quiet
strangely
quiet
it
seemed
to
me
and
of
course
besides
the
queer
misty
vessel
i
had
seen
in
the
west
i
was
all
the
time
remembering
the
four
shadowy
craft
lying
down
in
the
sea
under
our
port
side
every
time
i
remembered
them
i
felt
thankful
for
the
lanterns
round
the
maindeck
and
i
wondered
why
none
had
been
put
in
the
mizzen
rigging
i
wished
to
goodness
that
they
had
and
made
up
my
mind
i
would
speak
to
the
second
mate
about
it
next
time
he
came
aft
at
the
time
he
was
leaning
over
the
rail
across
the
break
of
the
poop
he
was
not
smoking
as
i
could
tell
for
had
he
been
i
should
have
seen
the
glow
of
his
pipe
now
and
then
it
was
plain
to
me
that
he
was
uneasy
three
times
already
he
had
been
down
on
to
the
maindeck
prowling
about
i
guessed
that
he
had
been
to
look
down
into
the
sea
for
any
signs
of
those
four
grim
craft
i
wondered
whether
they
would
be
visible
at
night
suddenly
the
struck
three
bells
and
the
deeper
notes
of
the
bell
forrard
answered
them
i
gave
a
start
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
had
been
struck
close
to
my
elbow
there
was
something
unaccountably
strange
in
the
air
that
night
then
even
as
the
second
mate
answered
the
all
well
there
came
the
sharp
whir
and
rattle
of
running
gear
on
the
port
side
of
the
mainmast
simultaneously
there
was
the
shrieking
of
a
parrel
up
the
main
and
i
knew
that
someone
or
something
had
let
go
the
from
aloft
there
came
the
sound
of
something
parting
then
the
crash
of
the
yard
as
it
ceased
falling
the
second
mate
shouted
out
something
unintelligible
and
jumped
for
the
ladder
from
the
maindeck
there
came
the
sound
of
running
feet
and
the
voices
of
the
watch
shouting
then
i
caught
the
skipper
voice
he
must
have
run
out
on
deck
through
the
saloon
doorway
get
some
more
lamps
get
some
more
lamps
he
was
singing
out
then
he
swore
he
sung
out
something
further
i
caught
the
last
two
words
carried
away
they
sounded
like
no
sir
shouted
the
second
mate
i
do
think
so
a
minute
of
some
confusion
followed
and
then
came
the
click
of
pawls
i
could
tell
that
they
had
taken
the
haulyards
to
the
after
capstan
odd
words
floated
up
to
me
all
this
water
i
heard
in
the
old
man
voice
he
appeared
to
be
asking
a
question
ca
say
sir
came
the
second
mate
there
was
a
period
of
time
filled
only
by
the
clicking
of
the
pawls
and
the
sounds
of
the
creaking
parrel
and
the
running
gear
then
the
second
mate
voice
came
again
seems
all
right
sir
i
heard
him
say
i
never
heard
the
old
man
reply
for
in
the
same
moment
there
came
to
me
a
chill
of
cold
breath
at
my
back
i
turned
sharply
and
saw
something
peering
over
the
taffrail
it
had
eyes
that
reflected
the
binnacle
light
weirdly
with
a
frightful
tigerish
gleam
but
beyond
that
i
could
see
nothing
with
any
distinctness
for
the
moment
i
just
stared
i
seemed
frozen
it
was
so
close
then
movement
came
to
me
and
i
jumped
to
the
binnacle
and
snatched
out
the
lamp
i
twitched
round
and
shone
the
light
towards
it
the
thing
whatever
it
was
had
come
more
forward
over
the
rail
but
now
before
the
light
it
recoiled
with
a
queer
horrible
litheness
it
slid
back
and
down
and
so
out
of
sight
i
have
only
a
confused
notion
of
a
wet
glistening
something
and
two
vile
eyes
then
i
was
running
crazy
towards
the
break
of
the
poop
i
sprang
down
the
ladder
and
missed
my
footing
and
landed
on
my
stern
at
the
bottom
in
my
left
hand
i
held
the
still
burning
binnacle
lamp
the
men
were
putting
away
the
but
at
my
abrupt
appearance
and
the
yell
i
gave
out
at
falling
one
or
two
of
them
fairly
ran
backwards
a
short
distance
in
sheer
funk
before
they
realised
what
it
was
from
somewhere
further
forrard
the
old
man
and
the
second
mate
came
running
aft
what
the
devil
up
now
sung
out
the
second
stopping
and
bending
to
stare
at
me
what
to
do
that
you
away
from
the
wheel
i
stood
up
and
tried
to
answer
him
but
i
was
so
shaken
that
i
could
only
stammer
i
i
there
i
stuttered
damnation
shouted
the
second
mate
angrily
get
back
to
the
wheel
i
hesitated
and
tried
to
explain
do
you
damned
well
hear
me
he
sung
out
yes
sir
but
i
began
get
up
on
to
the
poop
jessop
he
said
i
went
i
meant
to
explain
when
he
came
up
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
i
stopped
i
was
not
going
back
alone
to
that
wheel
down
below
i
heard
the
old
man
speaking
what
on
earth
is
it
now
mr
tulipson
he
was
saying
the
second
mate
made
no
immediate
reply
but
turned
to
the
men
who
were
evidently
crowding
near
that
will
do
men
he
said
somewhat
sharply
i
heard
the
watch
start
to
go
forrard
there
came
a
mutter
of
talk
from
them
then
the
second
mate
answered
the
old
man
he
could
not
have
known
that
i
was
near
enough
to
overhear
him
it
jessop
sir
he
must
have
seen
something
but
we
must
frighten
the
crowd
more
than
need
be
no
said
the
skipper
voice
they
turned
and
came
up
the
ladder
and
i
ran
back
a
few
steps
as
far
as
the
skylight
i
heard
the
old
man
speak
as
they
came
up
how
is
it
there
are
no
lamps
mr
tulipson
he
said
in
a
surprised
tone
i
thought
there
would
be
no
need
up
here
sir
the
second
mate
replied
then
he
added
something
about
saving
oil
better
have
them
i
think
i
heard
the
skipper
say
very
good
sir
answered
the
second
and
sung
out
to
the
to
bring
up
a
couple
of
lamps
then
the
two
of
them
walked
aft
to
where
i
stood
by
the
skylight
what
are
you
doing
away
from
the
wheel
asked
the
old
man
in
a
stern
voice
i
had
collected
my
wits
somewhat
by
now
i
wo
go
sir
till
there
a
light
i
said
the
skipper
stamped
his
foot
angrily
but
the
second
mate
stepped
forward
come
come
jessop
he
exclaimed
this
wo
do
you
know
better
get
back
to
the
wheel
without
further
bother
wait
a
minute
said
the
skipper
at
this
juncture
what
objection
have
you
to
going
back
to
the
wheel
he
asked
i
saw
something
i
said
it
was
climbing
over
the
taffrail
sir
ah
he
said
interrupting
me
with
a
quick
gesture
then
abruptly
sit
down
sit
down
you
all
in
a
shake
man
i
flopped
down
on
to
the
skylight
seat
i
was
as
he
had
said
all
in
a
shake
and
the
binnacle
lamp
was
wobbling
in
my
hand
so
that
the
light
from
it
went
dancing
here
and
there
across
the
deck
now
he
went
on
just
tell
us
what
you
saw
i
told
them
at
length
and
while
i
was
doing
so
the
brought
up
the
lights
and
lashed
one
up
on
the
sheerpole
in
each
rigging
shove
one
under
the
spanker
boom
the
old
man
sung
out
as
the
boy
finished
lashing
up
the
other
two
be
smart
now
i
i
sir
said
the
and
hurried
off
now
then
remarked
the
skipper
when
this
had
been
done
you
need
be
afraid
to
go
back
to
the
wheel
there
a
light
over
the
stern
and
the
second
mate
or
myself
will
be
up
here
all
the
time
i
stood
up
thank
you
sir
i
said
and
went
aft
i
replaced
my
lamp
in
the
binnacle
and
took
hold
of
the
wheel
yet
time
and
again
i
glanced
behind
and
i
was
very
thankful
when
a
few
minutes
later
four
bells
went
and
i
was
relieved
though
the
rest
of
the
chaps
were
forrard
in
the
i
did
not
go
there
i
shirked
being
questioned
about
my
sudden
appearance
at
the
foot
of
the
poop
ladder
and
so
i
lit
my
pipe
and
wandered
about
the
maindeck
i
did
not
feel
particularly
nervous
as
there
were
now
two
lanterns
in
each
rigging
and
a
couple
standing
upon
each
of
the
spare
under
the
bulwarks
yet
a
little
after
five
bells
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
saw
a
shadowy
face
peer
over
the
rail
a
little
abaft
the
fore
lanyards
i
snatched
up
one
of
the
lanterns
from
off
the
spar
and
flashed
the
light
towards
it
whereupon
there
was
nothing
only
on
my
mind
more
than
my
sight
i
fancy
a
queer
knowledge
remained
of
wet
peery
eyes
afterwards
when
i
thought
about
them
i
felt
extra
beastly
i
knew
then
how
brutal
they
had
been
inscrutable
you
know
once
more
in
that
same
watch
i
had
a
somewhat
similar
experience
only
in
this
instance
it
had
vanished
even
before
i
had
time
to
reach
a
light
and
then
came
eight
bells
and
our
watch
below
xv
great
ghost
when
we
were
called
again
at
a
quarter
to
four
the
man
who
roused
us
out
had
some
queer
information
toppin
gone
clean
vanished
he
told
us
as
we
began
to
turn
out
i
never
was
in
such
a
damned
hooker
as
this
here
it
safe
to
go
about
the
bloomin
decks
gone
asked
plummer
sitting
up
suddenly
and
throwing
his
legs
over
his
toppin
one
of
the
replied
the
man
we
been
all
over
the
bloomin
show
we
still
at
it
but
we
never
find
him
he
ended
with
a
sort
of
gloomy
assurance
oh
i
dunno
said
quoin
snoozin
somewheres
not
him
replied
the
man
i
tell
you
we
turned
everythin
upside
down
he
not
aboard
the
bloomin
ship
where
was
he
when
they
last
saw
him
i
asked
someone
must
know
something
you
know
keepin
time
up
on
the
poop
he
replied
the
old
man
nearly
shook
the
life
out
of
the
mate
and
the
chap
at
the
wheel
and
they
say
they
do
know
nothin
how
do
you
mean
i
inquired
how
do
you
mean
nothing
well
he
answered
the
youngster
was
there
one
minute
and
then
the
next
thing
they
knew
he
gone
they
both
sworn
black
an
blue
that
there
was
a
whisper
he
just
disappeared
off
of
the
face
of
the
bloomin
earth
i
got
down
on
to
my
chest
and
reached
for
my
boots
before
i
could
speak
again
the
man
was
saying
something
fresh
see
here
mates
he
went
on
if
things
is
goin
on
like
this
like
to
know
where
you
an
me
be
befor
long
we
be
in
said
plummer
i
dunno
as
i
like
to
think
it
said
quoin
we
have
to
think
about
it
replied
the
man
we
got
to
think
a
bloomin
lot
about
it
i
talked
to
our
side
an
they
game
game
for
what
i
asked
to
go
an
talk
straight
to
the
bloomin
capting
he
said
wagging
his
finger
at
me
it
make
tracks
for
the
nearest
bloomin
port
an
you
make
no
bloomin
mistake
i
opened
my
mouth
to
tell
him
that
the
probability
was
we
should
not
be
able
to
make
it
even
if
he
could
get
the
old
man
to
see
the
matter
from
his
point
of
view
then
i
remembered
that
the
chap
had
no
idea
of
the
things
i
had
seen
and
so
instead
i
said
supposing
he
wo
then
we
have
to
bloomin
well
make
him
he
replied
and
when
you
got
there
i
said
what
then
you
be
jolly
well
locked
up
for
mutiny
i
sooner
be
locked
up
he
said
it
do
kill
you
there
was
a
murmur
of
agreement
from
the
others
and
then
a
moment
of
silence
in
which
i
know
the
men
were
thinking
jaskett
voice
broke
into
it
i
never
thought
at
first
as
she
was
he
commenced
but
plummer
cut
in
across
his
speech
we
must
any
one
yer
know
he
said
that
mean
they
ai
been
er
bad
crowd
no
assented
everyone
including
the
chap
who
had
come
to
call
us
all
the
same
he
added
it
got
to
be
up
hellum
an
shove
her
into
the
nearest
bloomin
port
yes
said
everyone
and
then
eight
bells
went
and
we
cleared
out
on
deck
presently
after
in
which
there
had
come
a
queer
awkward
little
pause
at
toppin
name
tammy
came
over
to
me
the
rest
of
the
men
had
gone
forrard
and
i
guessed
they
were
talking
over
mad
plans
for
forcing
the
skipper
hand
and
making
him
put
into
port
poor
beggars
i
was
leaning
over
the
port
rail
by
the
fore
staring
down
into
the
sea
when
tammy
came
to
me
for
perhaps
a
minute
he
said
nothing
when
at
last
he
spoke
it
was
to
say
that
the
shadow
vessels
had
not
been
there
since
daylight
what
i
said
in
some
surprise
how
do
you
know
i
woke
up
when
they
were
searching
for
toppin
he
replied
i
not
been
asleep
since
i
came
here
right
away
he
began
to
say
something
further
but
stopped
short
yes
i
said
encouragingly
i
did
know
he
began
and
broke
off
he
caught
my
arm
oh
jessop
he
exclaimed
what
going
to
be
the
end
of
it
all
surely
something
can
be
done
i
said
nothing
i
had
a
desperate
feeling
that
there
was
very
little
we
could
do
to
help
ourselves
ca
we
do
something
he
asked
and
shook
my
arm
anything
better
than
we
being
still
i
said
nothing
but
stared
moodily
down
into
the
water
i
could
plan
nothing
though
i
would
get
mad
feverish
fits
of
thinking
do
you
hear
he
said
he
was
almost
crying
yes
tammy
i
replied
but
i
do
know
i
know
you
do
know
he
exclaimed
you
do
know
do
you
mean
we
just
to
give
in
and
be
murdered
one
after
another
we
done
all
we
can
i
replied
i
do
know
what
else
we
can
do
unless
we
go
below
and
lock
ourselves
in
every
night
that
would
be
better
than
this
he
said
there
be
no
one
to
go
below
or
anything
else
soon
but
what
if
it
came
on
to
blow
i
asked
we
be
having
the
sticks
blown
out
of
her
what
if
it
came
on
to
blow
he
returned
no
one
would
go
aloft
if
it
were
dark
you
said
yourself
besides
we
could
shorten
her
down
first
i
tell
you
in
a
few
days
there
wo
be
a
chap
alive
aboard
this
packet
unless
they
jolly
well
do
something
do
shout
i
warned
him
you
have
the
old
man
hearing
you
but
the
young
beggar
was
wound
up
and
would
take
no
notice
i
will
shout
he
replied
i
want
the
old
man
to
hear
i
a
good
mind
to
go
up
and
tell
him
he
started
on
a
fresh
tack
why
do
the
men
do
something
he
began
they
ought
to
damn
well
make
the
old
man
put
us
into
port
they
ought
for
goodness
sake
shut
up
you
little
fool
i
said
what
the
good
of
talking
a
lot
of
damned
rot
like
that
you
be
getting
yourself
into
trouble
i
do
care
he
replied
i
not
going
to
be
murdered
look
here
i
said
i
told
you
before
that
we
should
be
able
to
see
the
land
even
if
we
made
it
you
no
proof
he
answered
it
only
your
idea
well
i
replied
proof
or
no
proof
the
skipper
would
only
pile
her
up
if
he
tried
to
make
the
land
with
things
as
they
are
now
let
him
pile
her
up
he
answered
let
him
jolly
well
pile
her
up
that
would
be
better
than
staying
out
here
to
be
pulled
overboard
or
chucked
down
from
aloft
look
here
tammy
i
began
but
just
then
the
second
mate
sung
out
for
him
and
he
had
to
go
when
he
came
back
i
had
started
to
walk
to
and
from
across
the
fore
side
of
the
mainmast
he
joined
me
and
after
a
minute
he
started
his
wild
talk
again
look
here
tammy
i
said
once
more
it
no
use
your
talking
like
you
been
doing
things
are
as
they
are
and
it
no
one
fault
and
nobody
can
help
it
if
you
want
to
talk
sensibly
i
listen
if
not
then
go
and
gas
to
someone
else
with
that
i
returned
to
the
port
side
and
got
up
on
the
spar
again
intending
to
sit
on
the
pinrail
and
have
a
bit
of
a
talk
with
him
before
sitting
down
i
glanced
over
into
the
sea
the
action
had
been
almost
mechanical
yet
after
a
few
instants
i
was
in
a
state
of
the
most
intense
excitement
and
without
withdrawing
my
gaze
i
reached
out
and
caught
tammy
arm
to
attract
his
attention
my
god
i
muttered
look
what
is
it
he
asked
and
bent
over
the
rail
beside
me
and
this
is
what
we
saw
a
little
distance
below
the
surface
there
lay
a
disc
it
seemed
only
a
few
feet
down
below
it
we
saw
quite
clearly
after
a
few
moment
staring
the
shadow
of
a
and
deeper
the
gear
and
of
a
great
mast
far
down
among
the
shadows
i
thought
presently
that
i
could
make
out
the
immense
indefinite
stretch
of
vast
decks
my
god
whispered
tammy
and
shut
up
but
presently
he
gave
out
a
short
exclamation
as
though
an
idea
had
come
to
him
and
got
down
off
the
spar
and
ran
forrard
on
to
the
head
he
came
running
back
after
a
short
look
into
the
sea
to
tell
me
that
there
was
the
truck
of
another
great
mast
coming
up
there
a
bit
off
the
bow
to
within
a
few
feet
of
the
surface
of
the
sea
in
the
meantime
you
know
i
had
been
staring
like
mad
down
through
the
water
at
the
huge
shadowy
mast
just
below
me
i
had
traced
out
bit
by
bit
until
now
i
could
clearly
see
the
jackstay
running
along
the
top
of
the
royal
mast
and
you
know
the
royal
itself
was
but
you
know
what
was
getting
at
me
more
than
anything
was
a
feeling
that
there
was
movement
down
in
the
water
there
among
the
rigging
i
i
could
actually
see
at
times
things
moving
and
glinting
faintly
and
rapidly
to
and
fro
in
the
gear
and
once
i
was
practically
certain
that
something
was
on
the
moving
in
to
the
mast
as
though
you
know
it
might
have
come
up
the
leech
of
the
sail
and
this
way
i
got
a
beastly
feeling
that
there
were
things
swarming
down
there
unconsciously
i
must
have
leant
further
and
further
out
over
the
side
staring
and
suddenly
good
lord
how
i
yelled
i
overbalanced
i
made
a
sweeping
grab
and
caught
the
fore
brace
and
with
that
i
was
back
in
a
moment
upon
the
spar
in
the
same
second
almost
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
surface
of
the
water
above
the
submerged
truck
was
broken
and
i
am
sure
i
saw
something
a
moment
in
the
air
against
the
ship
side
a
sort
of
shadow
in
the
air
though
i
did
not
realise
it
at
the
time
anyway
the
next
instant
tammy
gave
out
an
awful
scream
and
was
head
downwards
over
the
rail
in
a
second
i
had
an
idea
that
he
was
jumping
overboard
i
collared
him
by
the
waist
of
his
britchers
and
one
knee
and
then
i
had
him
down
on
the
deck
and
sat
plump
on
him
for
he
was
struggling
and
shouting
all
the
time
and
i
was
so
breathless
and
shaken
and
gone
to
mush
i
could
not
have
trusted
my
hands
to
hold
him
you
see
i
never
thought
it
was
anything
but
some
influence
at
work
on
him
and
that
he
was
trying
to
get
loose
to
go
over
the
side
but
i
know
that
i
saw
the
that
had
him
only
at
the
time
i
was
so
mixed
up
and
with
the
one
idea
in
my
head
i
was
not
really
able
to
notice
anything
properly
but
afterwards
i
comprehended
a
bit
you
can
understand
ca
you
what
i
had
seen
at
the
time
without
taking
in
and
even
now
looking
back
i
know
that
the
shadow
was
only
like
a
greyness
in
the
daylight
against
the
whiteness
of
the
decks
clinging
against
tammy
and
there
was
i
all
breathless
and
sweating
and
quivery
with
my
own
tumble
sitting
on
the
little
screeching
beggar
and
he
fighting
like
a
mad
thing
so
that
i
thought
i
should
never
hold
him
and
then
i
heard
the
second
mate
shouting
and
there
came
running
feet
along
the
deck
then
many
hands
were
pulling
and
hauling
to
get
me
off
him
bl
y
cowyard
sung
out
someone
hold
him
hold
him
i
shouted
he
be
overboard
at
that
they
seemed
to
understand
that
i
was
not
the
youngster
for
they
stopped
manhandling
me
and
allowed
me
to
rise
while
two
of
them
took
hold
of
tammy
and
kept
him
safe
what
the
matter
with
him
the
second
mate
was
singing
out
happened
he
gone
off
his
head
i
think
i
said
what
asked
the
second
mate
but
before
i
could
answer
him
tammy
ceased
suddenly
to
struggle
and
flopped
down
upon
the
deck
fainted
said
plummer
with
some
sympathy
he
looked
at
me
with
a
puzzled
suspicious
air
what
what
been
doin
take
him
aft
into
the
berth
ordered
the
second
mate
a
bit
abruptly
it
struck
me
that
he
wished
to
prevent
questions
he
must
have
tumbled
to
the
fact
that
we
had
seen
something
about
which
it
would
be
better
not
to
tell
the
crowd
plummer
stooped
to
lift
the
boy
no
said
the
second
mate
not
you
plummer
jessop
you
take
him
he
turned
to
the
rest
of
the
men
that
will
do
he
told
them
and
they
went
forrard
muttering
a
little
i
lifted
the
boy
and
carried
him
aft
no
need
to
take
him
into
the
berth
said
the
second
mate
put
him
down
on
the
after
hatch
i
sent
the
other
lad
for
some
brandy
then
the
brandy
came
we
dosed
tammy
and
soon
brought
him
round
he
sat
up
with
a
somewhat
dazed
air
otherwise
he
seemed
quiet
and
sane
enough
what
up
he
asked
he
caught
sight
of
the
second
mate
have
i
been
ill
sir
he
exclaimed
you
right
enough
now
youngster
said
the
second
mate
you
been
a
bit
off
you
better
go
and
lie
down
for
a
bit
i
all
right
now
sir
replied
tammy
i
do
think
you
do
as
you
told
interrupted
the
second
do
always
have
to
be
told
twice
if
i
want
you
i
send
for
you
tammy
stood
up
and
made
his
way
in
rather
an
unsteady
fashion
into
the
berth
i
fancy
he
was
glad
enough
to
lie
down
now
then
jessop
exclaimed
the
second
mate
turning
to
me
been
the
cause
of
all
this
out
with
it
now
smart
i
commenced
to
tell
him
but
almost
directly
he
put
up
his
hand
hold
on
a
minute
he
said
there
the
breeze
he
jumped
up
the
port
ladder
and
sung
out
to
the
chap
at
the
wheel
then
down
again
starboard
fore
brace
he
sung
out
he
turned
to
me
you
have
to
finish
telling
me
afterwards
he
said
i
i
sir
i
replied
and
went
to
join
the
other
chaps
at
the
braces
as
soon
as
we
were
braced
sharp
up
on
the
port
tack
he
sent
some
of
the
watch
up
to
loose
the
sails
then
he
sung
out
for
me
go
on
with
your
yarn
now
jessop
he
said
i
told
him
about
the
great
shadow
vessel
and
i
said
something
about
tammy
i
mean
about
my
not
being
sure
whether
he
tried
to
jump
overboard
because
you
see
i
began
to
realise
that
i
had
seen
the
shadow
and
i
remembered
the
stirring
of
the
water
above
the
submerged
truck
but
the
second
did
not
wait
of
course
for
any
theories
but
was
away
like
a
shot
to
see
for
himself
he
ran
to
the
side
and
looked
down
i
followed
and
stood
beside
him
yet
now
that
the
surface
of
the
water
was
blurred
by
the
wind
we
could
see
nothing
it
no
good
he
remarked
after
a
minute
you
better
get
away
from
the
rail
before
any
of
the
others
see
you
just
be
taking
those
halyards
aft
to
the
capstan
from
then
until
eight
bells
we
were
hard
at
work
getting
the
sail
upon
her
and
when
at
last
eight
bells
went
i
made
haste
to
swallow
my
breakfast
and
get
a
sleep
at
midday
when
we
went
on
deck
for
the
afternoon
watch
i
ran
to
the
side
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
great
shadow
ship
all
that
watch
the
second
mate
kept
me
working
at
my
paunch
mat
and
tammy
he
put
on
to
his
sinnet
telling
me
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
youngster
but
the
boy
was
right
enough
as
i
scarcely
doubted
now
you
know
though
a
most
unusual
thing
he
hardly
opened
his
lips
the
whole
afternoon
then
at
four
we
went
below
for
tea
at
four
bells
when
we
came
on
deck
again
i
found
that
the
light
breeze
which
had
kept
us
going
during
the
day
had
dropped
and
we
were
only
just
moving
the
sun
was
low
down
and
the
sky
clear
once
or
twice
as
i
glanced
across
to
the
horizon
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
caught
again
that
odd
quiver
in
the
air
that
had
preceded
the
coming
of
the
mist
and
indeed
on
two
separate
occasions
i
saw
a
thin
whisp
of
haze
drive
up
apparently
out
of
the
sea
this
was
at
some
little
distance
on
our
port
beam
otherwise
all
was
quiet
and
peaceful
and
though
i
stared
into
the
water
i
could
make
out
no
vestige
of
that
great
shadow
ship
down
in
the
sea
it
was
some
little
time
after
six
bells
that
the
order
came
for
all
hands
to
shorten
sail
for
the
night
we
took
in
the
royals
and
and
then
the
three
courses
it
was
shortly
after
this
that
a
rumour
went
round
the
ship
that
there
was
to
be
no
that
night
after
eight
this
naturally
created
a
good
deal
of
talk
among
the
men
especially
as
the
yarn
went
that
the
doors
were
to
be
shut
and
fastened
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
and
that
no
one
was
to
be
allowed
on
deck
goin
ter
take
ther
wheel
i
heard
plummer
ask
i
they
us
take
as
usual
replied
one
of
the
men
one
of
ther
officers
is
bound
ter
be
on
ther
poop
so
we
company
apart
from
these
remarks
there
was
a
general
opinion
that
if
it
were
true
it
was
a
sensible
act
on
the
part
of
the
skipper
as
one
of
the
men
said
it
ai
likely
that
there
be
any
of
us
missin
in
ther
mornin
if
we
stays
in
our
bunks
all
ther
blessed
night
and
soon
after
this
eight
bells
went
xvi
ghost
at
the
moment
when
eight
bells
actually
went
i
was
in
the
talking
to
four
of
the
other
watch
suddenly
away
aft
i
heard
shouting
and
then
on
the
deck
overhead
came
the
loud
thudding
of
someone
pomping
with
a
straightway
i
turned
and
made
a
run
for
the
port
doorway
along
with
the
four
other
men
we
rushed
out
through
the
doorway
on
to
the
deck
it
was
getting
dusk
but
that
did
not
hide
from
me
a
terrible
and
extraordinary
sight
all
along
the
port
rail
there
was
a
queer
undulating
greyness
that
moved
downwards
inboard
and
spread
over
the
decks
as
i
looked
i
found
that
i
saw
more
clearly
in
a
most
extraordinary
way
and
suddenly
all
the
moving
greyness
resolved
into
hundreds
of
strange
men
in
the
they
looked
unreal
and
impossible
as
though
there
had
come
upon
us
the
inhabitants
of
some
fantastic
my
god
i
thought
i
was
mad
they
swarmed
in
upon
us
in
a
great
wave
of
murderous
living
shadows
from
some
of
the
men
who
must
have
been
going
aft
for
there
rose
into
the
evening
air
a
loud
awful
shouting
aloft
yelled
someone
but
as
i
looked
aloft
i
saw
that
the
horrible
things
were
swarming
there
in
scores
and
scores
jesus
christ
shrieked
a
man
voice
cut
short
and
my
glance
dropped
from
aloft
to
find
two
of
the
men
who
had
come
out
from
the
with
me
rolling
upon
the
deck
they
were
two
indistinguishable
masses
that
writhed
here
and
there
across
the
planks
the
brutes
fairly
covered
them
from
them
came
muffled
little
shrieks
and
gasps
and
there
i
stood
and
with
me
were
the
other
two
men
a
man
darted
past
us
into
the
with
two
grey
men
on
his
back
and
i
heard
them
kill
him
the
two
men
by
me
ran
suddenly
across
the
fore
hatch
and
up
the
starboard
ladder
on
to
the
head
yet
almost
in
the
same
instant
i
saw
several
of
the
grey
men
disappear
up
the
other
ladder
from
the
head
above
i
heard
the
two
men
commence
to
shout
and
this
died
away
into
a
loud
scuffling
at
that
i
turned
to
see
whether
i
could
get
away
i
stared
round
hopelessly
and
then
with
two
jumps
i
was
on
the
pigsty
and
from
there
upon
the
top
of
the
deckhouse
i
threw
myself
flat
and
waited
breathlessly
all
at
once
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
darker
than
it
had
been
the
previous
moment
and
i
raised
my
head
very
cautiously
i
saw
that
the
ship
was
enveloped
in
great
billows
of
mist
and
then
not
six
feet
from
me
i
made
out
someone
lying
face
downwards
it
was
tammy
i
felt
safer
now
that
we
were
hidden
by
the
mist
and
i
crawled
to
him
he
gave
a
quick
gasp
of
terror
when
i
touched
him
but
when
he
saw
who
it
was
he
started
to
sob
like
a
little
kid
hush
i
said
for
god
sake
be
quiet
but
i
need
not
have
troubled
for
the
shrieks
of
the
men
being
killed
down
on
the
decks
all
around
us
drowned
every
other
sound
i
knelt
up
and
glanced
round
and
then
aloft
overhead
i
could
make
out
dimly
the
spars
and
sails
and
now
as
i
looked
i
saw
that
the
and
royals
had
been
unloosed
and
were
hanging
in
the
buntlines
almost
in
the
same
moment
the
terrible
crying
of
the
poor
beggars
about
the
decks
ceased
and
there
succeeded
an
awful
silence
in
which
i
could
distinctly
hear
tammy
sobbing
i
reached
out
and
shook
him
be
quiet
be
quiet
i
whispered
intensely
they
hear
us
at
my
touch
and
whisper
he
struggled
to
become
silent
and
then
overhead
i
saw
the
six
yards
being
swiftly
scarcely
were
the
sails
set
when
i
heard
the
swish
and
flick
of
gaskets
being
cast
adrift
on
the
lower
yards
and
realised
that
ghostly
things
were
at
work
there
for
a
moment
or
so
there
was
silence
and
i
made
my
way
cautiously
to
the
after
end
of
the
house
and
peered
over
yet
because
of
the
mist
i
could
see
nothing
then
abruptly
from
behind
me
came
a
single
wail
of
sudden
pain
and
terror
from
tammy
it
ended
instantly
in
a
sort
of
choke
i
stood
up
in
the
mist
and
ran
back
to
where
i
had
left
the
kid
but
he
had
gone
i
stood
dazed
i
felt
like
shrieking
out
loud
above
me
i
heard
the
flaps
of
the
course
being
tumbled
off
the
yards
down
upon
the
decks
there
were
the
noises
of
a
multitude
working
in
a
weird
inhuman
silence
then
came
the
squeal
and
rattle
of
blocks
and
braces
aloft
they
were
squaring
the
yards
i
remained
standing
i
watched
the
yards
squared
and
then
i
saw
the
sails
fill
suddenly
an
instant
later
the
deck
of
the
house
upon
which
i
stood
became
canted
forrard
the
slope
increased
so
that
i
could
scarcely
stand
and
i
grabbed
at
one
of
the
i
wondered
in
a
stunned
sort
of
way
what
was
happening
almost
directly
afterwards
from
the
deck
on
the
port
side
of
the
house
there
came
a
sudden
loud
human
scream
and
immediately
from
different
parts
of
the
decks
there
rose
afresh
some
most
horrible
shouts
of
agony
from
odd
men
this
grew
into
an
intense
screaming
that
shook
my
heart
up
and
there
came
again
a
noise
of
desperate
brief
fighting
then
a
breath
of
cold
wind
seemed
to
play
in
the
mist
and
i
could
see
down
the
slope
of
the
deck
i
looked
below
me
towards
the
bows
the
jibboom
was
plunged
right
into
the
water
and
as
i
stared
the
bows
disappeared
into
the
sea
the
deck
of
the
house
became
a
wall
to
me
and
i
was
swinging
from
the
winch
which
was
now
above
my
head
i
watched
the
ocean
lap
over
the
edge
of
the
head
and
rush
down
on
to
the
maindeck
roaring
into
the
empty
and
still
all
around
me
came
crying
of
the
lost
i
heard
something
strike
the
corner
of
the
house
above
me
with
a
dull
thud
and
then
i
saw
plummer
plunge
down
into
the
flood
beneath
i
remembered
that
he
had
been
at
the
wheel
the
next
instant
the
water
had
leapt
to
my
feet
there
came
a
drear
chorus
of
bubbling
screams
a
roar
of
waters
and
i
was
going
swiftly
down
into
the
darkness
i
let
go
of
the
winch
and
struck
out
madly
trying
to
hold
my
breath
there
was
a
loud
singing
in
my
ears
it
grew
louder
i
opened
my
mouth
i
felt
i
was
dying
and
then
thank
god
i
was
at
the
surface
breathing
for
the
moment
i
was
blinded
with
the
water
and
my
agony
of
breathlessness
then
growing
easier
i
brushed
the
water
from
my
eyes
and
so
not
three
hundred
yards
away
i
made
out
a
large
ship
floating
almost
motionless
at
first
i
could
scarcely
believe
i
saw
aright
then
as
i
realised
that
indeed
there
was
yet
a
chance
of
living
i
started
to
swim
towards
you
you
know
the
rest
and
you
think
said
the
captain
interrogatively
and
stopped
short
no
replied
jessop
i
do
think
i
none
of
us
a
gospel
fact
people
about
queer
things
happening
at
sea
but
this
is
one
of
them
this
is
one
of
the
things
you
all
seen
queer
things
perhaps
more
than
i
have
it
depends
but
they
go
down
in
the
log
these
kinds
of
things
never
do
this
one
wo
at
least
not
as
it
really
happened
he
nodded
his
head
slowly
and
went
on
addressing
the
captain
more
particularly
i
bet
he
said
deliberately
that
you
enter
it
in
the
something
like
this
s
w
light
winds
from
the
south
and
east
sighted
a
ship
on
the
starboard
bow
overhauled
her
in
the
first
signalled
her
but
received
no
response
during
the
second
she
steadily
refused
to
communicate
about
eight
bells
it
was
observed
that
she
seemed
to
be
settling
by
the
head
and
a
minute
later
she
foundered
suddenly
bows
foremost
with
all
her
crew
put
out
a
boat
and
picked
up
one
of
the
men
an
by
the
name
of
jessop
he
was
quite
unable
to
give
any
explanation
of
the
catastrophe
and
you
two
he
made
a
gesture
at
the
first
and
second
mates
will
probably
sign
your
names
to
it
and
so
will
i
and
perhaps
one
of
your
then
when
we
get
home
they
print
a
report
of
it
in
the
newspapers
and
people
will
talk
about
the
unseaworthy
ships
maybe
some
of
the
experts
will
talk
rot
about
rivets
and
defective
plates
and
so
forth
he
laughed
cynically
then
he
went
on
and
you
know
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
there
no
one
except
our
own
selves
will
ever
know
how
it
happened
really
the
shellbacks
count
they
only
drunken
brutes
of
poor
devils
no
one
would
think
of
taking
anything
they
said
as
anything
more
than
a
damned
cuffer
besides
the
beggars
only
tell
these
things
when
they
they
would
then
for
fear
of
being
laughed
at
only
they
not
responsible
he
broke
off
and
looked
round
at
us
the
skipper
and
the
two
mates
nodded
their
heads
in
silent
assent
appendix
silent
i
the
third
mate
of
the
the
vessel
that
picked
up
jessop
you
know
and
he
asked
us
to
write
a
short
note
of
what
we
saw
from
our
side
and
sign
it
the
old
man
set
me
on
the
job
as
he
says
i
can
put
it
better
than
he
can
well
it
was
in
the
first
that
we
came
up
with
her
the
i
mean
but
it
was
in
the
second
that
it
happened
the
mate
and
i
were
on
the
poop
watching
her
you
see
signalled
her
and
she
not
taken
any
notice
and
that
seemed
queer
as
we
could
have
been
more
than
three
or
four
hundred
yards
off
her
port
beam
and
it
was
a
fine
evening
so
that
we
could
almost
have
had
a
if
they
seemed
a
pleasant
crowd
as
it
was
we
called
them
a
set
of
sulky
swine
and
left
it
at
that
though
we
still
kept
our
hoist
up
all
the
same
you
know
we
watched
her
a
lot
and
i
remember
even
then
i
thought
it
queer
how
quiet
she
was
we
could
even
hear
her
bell
go
and
i
spoke
to
the
mate
about
it
and
he
said
he
been
noticing
the
same
thing
then
about
six
bells
they
shortened
her
right
down
to
and
i
can
tell
you
that
made
us
stare
more
than
ever
as
anyone
can
imagine
and
i
remember
we
noticed
then
especially
that
we
could
hear
a
single
sound
from
her
even
when
the
haul
yards
were
let
go
and
you
know
without
the
glass
i
saw
their
old
man
singing
out
something
but
we
did
get
a
sound
of
it
and
we
have
been
able
to
hear
every
word
then
just
before
eight
bells
the
thing
jessop
told
us
about
happened
both
the
mate
and
the
old
man
said
they
could
see
men
going
up
her
side
a
bit
indistinct
you
know
because
it
was
getting
dusk
but
the
second
mate
and
i
half
thought
we
did
and
half
thought
we
did
but
there
was
something
queer
we
all
knew
that
and
it
looked
like
a
sort
of
moving
mist
along
her
side
i
know
i
felt
pretty
funny
but
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
of
course
to
be
too
sure
and
serious
about
until
you
sure
after
the
mate
and
the
captain
had
said
they
saw
the
men
boarding
her
we
began
to
hear
sounds
from
her
very
queer
at
first
and
rather
like
a
phonograph
makes
when
it
getting
up
speed
then
the
sounds
came
properly
from
her
and
we
heard
them
shouting
and
yelling
and
you
know
i
do
know
even
now
just
what
i
really
thought
i
was
all
so
queer
and
mixed
the
next
thing
i
remember
there
was
a
thick
mist
round
the
ship
and
then
all
the
noise
was
shut
off
as
if
it
were
all
the
other
side
of
a
door
but
we
could
still
see
her
masts
and
spars
and
sails
above
the
misty
stuff
and
both
the
captain
and
the
mate
said
they
could
see
men
aloft
and
i
thought
i
could
but
the
second
mate
was
sure
all
the
same
though
the
sails
were
all
loosed
in
about
a
minute
it
seemed
and
the
yards
mastheaded
we
could
see
the
courses
above
the
mist
but
jessop
says
they
were
loosed
too
and
sheeted
home
along
with
the
upper
sails
then
we
saw
the
yards
squared
and
i
saw
the
sails
fill
bang
up
with
wind
and
yet
you
know
ours
were
slatting
the
next
thing
was
the
one
that
hit
me
more
than
anything
her
masts
took
a
cant
forrard
and
then
i
saw
her
stem
come
up
out
of
the
mist
that
was
round
her
then
all
in
an
instant
we
could
hear
sounds
from
the
vessel
again
and
i
tell
you
the
men
did
seem
to
be
shouting
but
screaming
her
stern
went
higher
it
was
most
extraordinary
to
look
at
and
then
she
went
plunk
down
head
foremost
right
bang
into
the
it
all
right
what
jessop
says
and
when
we
saw
him
swimming
i
was
the
one
who
spotted
him
we
got
out
a
boat
quicker
than
a
ever
got
out
a
boat
before
i
should
think
the
captain
and
the
mate
and
the
second
and
i
are
all
going
to
sign
this
