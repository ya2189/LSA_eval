chapter
i
on
the
way
back
from
the
game
but
the
bird
boys
won
the
prize
of
a
silver
cup
what
if
they
did
it
was
by
a
hair
breadth
mr
smarty
and
their
monoplane
was
proven
to
be
faster
than
the
big
biplane
you
built
puss
carberry
oh
was
it
do
you
be
too
sure
of
that
larry
did
it
land
on
the
summit
of
old
thunder
top
ahead
of
you
and
sandy
in
the
race
that
afternoon
tell
me
that
and
larry
geohegan
bristled
up
to
the
recognized
bully
of
bloomsbury
while
a
dozen
fellows
clustered
around
on
the
deck
of
the
big
power
boat
listening
eagerly
to
this
war
of
words
they
were
on
their
way
home
from
a
very
exciting
game
of
baseball
that
had
been
played
at
cranford
across
the
lake
and
after
ten
innings
of
hot
work
the
nine
from
bloomsbury
had
won
but
not
until
they
had
changed
pitchers
upon
tying
the
score
in
the
ninth
after
coming
up
from
behind
puss
and
larry
both
wore
the
uniform
of
the
home
players
and
there
were
others
on
the
boat
who
also
belonged
to
the
team
in
fact
the
staunch
vessel
had
been
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
baseball
club
for
this
day
by
commodore
elliott
the
rich
owner
larry
had
never
been
one
of
the
adherents
whom
puss
could
call
upon
to
back
him
up
when
he
tried
conclusions
with
a
hostile
faction
in
fact
larry
had
always
been
an
admirer
of
frank
bird
who
was
recognized
as
the
most
persistent
rival
the
bully
had
ever
encountered
in
his
whole
career
since
coming
to
bloomsbury
puss
allowed
a
contemptuous
expression
to
take
possession
of
his
face
and
even
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
after
a
nasty
fashion
he
had
that
often
angered
the
one
he
was
arguing
with
more
than
words
could
have
done
aw
rats
he
said
in
a
disagreeable
rasping
voice
everybody
knows
that
i
won
that
same
race
only
for
trouble
with
my
engine
frank
was
lucky
just
like
he
generally
is
when
he
goes
in
for
anything
look
at
him
today
being
called
in
to
pitch
in
the
tenth
we
had
badly
rattled
and
they
were
on
the
toboggan
sure
yet
frank
the
great
hero
gets
credit
for
winning
that
game
did
the
bloomsbury
crowd
cheer
him
to
the
echo
though
and
want
to
ride
him
on
their
shoulders
wow
it
makes
me
sick
to
see
such
toadyism
what
all
this
big
noise
about
fellows
did
i
hear
my
name
mentioned
asked
a
tall
lad
with
a
frank
face
and
clear
brown
eyes
as
he
pushed
forward
it
was
frank
bird
himself
who
had
been
talking
with
his
cousin
andy
and
several
other
fellows
in
the
bow
of
the
launch
and
by
accident
heard
the
voices
that
were
raised
in
dispute
percy
carberry
known
among
his
comrades
simply
as
puss
did
not
flinch
when
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
boy
he
detested
so
thoroughly
they
had
never
as
yet
actually
come
to
blows
but
puss
believed
that
his
muscular
powers
were
far
superior
to
those
of
his
more
slender
rival
and
just
now
he
was
in
a
particularly
bitter
frame
of
mind
oh
so
you
there
are
you
he
sneered
i
was
just
telling
your
good
friend
larry
here
that
i
considered
you
a
greatly
overrated
substitute
pitcher
and
that
luck
had
as
much
to
do
with
our
winning
that
game
today
as
anything
you
did
frank
bird
laughed
in
his
face
sure
he
declared
cheerily
i
was
a
mighty
small
factor
in
the
victory
for
i
only
played
in
one
short
inning
if
i
faced
those
hard
hitters
of
cranford
nine
times
i
reckon
it
be
hard
to
tell
what
have
done
to
my
poor
inshoots
and
curves
but
you
held
them
in
that
inning
frank
you
know
you
did
cried
larry
mere
accident
my
boy
happened
to
be
the
weak
end
of
their
batting
list
observed
frank
as
if
determined
to
agree
with
his
enemy
and
thus
spike
his
guns
is
that
so
demanded
elephant
small
who
did
not
happen
to
be
on
the
nine
because
of
his
customary
slow
ways
perhaps
you
be
saying
that
dandy
you
whanged
out
that
brought
in
the
winning
run
was
also
an
accident
well
i
must
have
just
shut
my
eyes
and
struck
i
seem
to
remember
hearing
a
sound
like
a
shot
and
then
they
all
yelled
to
me
to
run
so
i
did
going
on
to
second
in
time
to
see
peterkin
gallop
home
and
frank
looked
as
sober
as
a
judge
as
he
said
this
the
others
saw
the
joke
however
and
led
by
larry
burst
out
into
a
laugh
that
made
puss
and
his
loyal
backers
scowl
if
that
bingle
was
an
accident
do
we
wish
we
had
a
few
more
players
who
could
shut
their
eyes
and
meet
frazer
terrible
speed
balls
and
curves
in
the
same
way
one
fellow
exclaimed
so
say
we
all
of
us
another
cried
puss
realized
that
the
majority
on
board
the
were
against
him
but
he
was
not
given
to
taking
water
even
his
enemies
and
he
had
many
in
bloomsbury
could
hardly
say
that
puss
was
lacking
in
a
certain
kind
of
grit
while
stubbornness
he
possessed
in
abundance
so
he
just
shut
his
white
teeth
hard
together
and
looked
scowlingly
around
the
bunch
of
fellows
and
many
of
them
felt
a
little
chill
when
those
cold
gray
eyes
rested
upon
them
for
they
knew
of
old
what
happened
when
puss
carberry
made
up
his
mind
to
mark
a
boy
for
future
attention
frank
still
stood
there
by
the
side
of
the
boat
smiling
perhaps
his
very
apparent
unconcern
served
to
make
the
other
still
more
angry
there
had
been
bad
blood
between
these
two
lads
for
a
long
time
and
more
than
once
it
threatened
an
eruption
which
somehow
or
other
had
up
to
now
been
stayed
although
some
weeks
had
passed
since
the
race
between
the
rival
aeroplanes
piloted
by
these
two
boys
in
which
frank
took
his
little
craft
up
to
the
lofty
summit
of
old
thunder
top
ahead
of
puss
in
his
biplane
as
narrated
in
the
first
volume
of
this
series
entitled
the
bird
boys
or
the
young
sky
pilot
first
air
voyage
the
latter
had
never
ceased
to
feel
ugly
over
his
defeat
as
usual
he
had
what
he
considered
a
good
excuse
for
his
arriving
second
but
few
persons
ever
knew
how
puss
and
his
helper
sandy
had
tried
to
injure
frank
airship
when
it
was
directly
beneath
them
by
deliberately
dropping
a
sand
bag
taken
along
singularly
enough
as
ballast
but
with
this
very
idea
in
view
seems
to
me
you
gotten
the
big
head
ever
since
you
happened
to
drop
on
that
rocky
plateau
on
top
of
the
mountain
just
three
little
seconds
ahead
of
me
frank
bird
he
said
with
a
steely
glitter
in
his
eyes
that
those
who
knew
him
best
understood
to
mean
coming
trouble
oh
i
hope
not
puss
replied
the
other
with
a
smile
i
give
you
my
word
my
hat
fits
me
just
as
comfortably
as
ever
it
was
a
close
race
and
the
one
who
got
there
first
had
much
to
crow
about
for
a
fact
we
happened
to
be
lucky
not
to
have
any
trouble
with
our
new
little
kinkaid
engine
that
was
all
huh
grunted
his
cousin
andy
shaking
his
head
and
scowling
at
puss
in
turn
but
we
had
plenty
of
other
sorts
of
trouble
all
the
same
sand
bags
full
of
it
in
fact
they
just
rained
down
on
us
but
then
frank
knows
how
to
check
up
his
engine
suddenly
and
the
storm
passed
by
without
any
hurt
some
of
the
fellows
who
happened
to
know
what
this
sly
reference
on
the
part
of
the
hotheaded
andy
meant
began
to
chuckle
of
course
such
a
thing
would
only
serve
to
make
puss
more
angry
he
chose
to
believe
that
they
were
all
only
trying
to
bait
him
frank
in
particular
came
in
for
his
dark
looks
and
larry
who
had
once
run
in
the
same
company
as
puss
so
that
he
knew
his
whims
better
than
many
others
took
occasion
to
give
frank
bird
a
sly
nudge
in
the
side
as
he
whispered
look
out
for
him
frank
he
getting
near
the
danger
point
sure
but
frank
did
not
have
to
be
warned
he
had
grown
tired
of
warding
off
this
ever
threatening
danger
of
a
broil
with
puss
carberry
like
his
cousin
andy
the
other
had
no
father
and
his
wealthy
mother
had
long
since
given
up
in
despair
the
idea
of
controlling
the
headstrong
lad
so
that
puss
had
his
way
whenever
he
wanted
to
do
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
because
carberry
was
one
of
his
father
patients
and
bird
esteemed
her
very
highly
frank
had
postponed
the
reckoning
just
as
long
as
he
could
endure
the
insults
of
the
bully
but
he
believed
the
last
ditch
had
been
reached
and
was
determined
to
no
longer
raise
a
hand
to
avert
the
threatening
storm
puss
had
turned
when
andy
spoke
to
flash
a
look
in
his
direction
but
it
had
no
effect
upon
the
other
who
could
be
as
reckless
at
times
as
the
next
one
indeed
frank
often
had
to
curb
the
impatience
and
daring
of
his
chum
oh
that
what
sticks
in
your
craw
does
it
andy
bird
demanded
puss
just
because
sandy
happened
to
drop
that
ballast
thinking
we
might
make
better
time
if
we
lightened
ship
you
choose
to
make
all
sorts
of
nasty
insinuations
about
us
wanting
to
knock
you
out
shows
where
your
mind
is
another
fellow
would
ever
let
such
a
fool
notion
get
a
grip
on
him
and
you
better
put
a
reef
in
that
tongue
of
yours
my
boy
unless
you
want
to
have
it
get
you
into
trouble
andy
flared
up
at
once
and
would
have
replied
but
frank
calmly
stepped
in
between
the
two
as
though
he
claimed
first
right
neither
of
us
have
charged
you
with
intentionally
trying
to
disable
our
aeroplane
by
dropping
that
sand
bag
puss
he
remarked
quietly
all
we
say
is
that
it
was
a
queer
coincidence
you
wanted
to
get
rid
of
your
ballast
just
when
we
were
walking
up
on
you
hand
over
fist
and
about
to
pass
under
you
to
take
the
lead
that
all
again
there
was
a
low
laugh
from
among
the
boys
who
stood
around
listening
to
them
it
was
a
rich
treat
to
see
the
recognized
bully
of
bloomsbury
baited
to
his
very
face
in
this
characteristic
way
and
they
were
enjoying
it
hugely
well
let
me
tell
you
it
ai
all
not
by
a
jugful
exclaimed
puss
his
face
taking
on
a
purple
hue
as
it
always
did
when
he
became
enraged
both
of
you
fellows
have
got
to
stop
speaking
about
that
sand
bag
dropping
or
there
going
to
be
a
licking
in
store
for
you
see
and
he
thrust
his
face
close
to
that
of
frank
as
he
said
this
larry
geohegan
fairly
held
his
breath
now
it
coming
do
i
know
the
signs
he
whispered
to
the
boy
next
him
frank
continued
to
stand
there
close
to
the
side
of
the
speeding
launch
they
were
about
half
way
across
the
deep
lake
at
the
time
evening
was
coming
on
for
the
sun
had
just
reached
the
distant
rugged
horizon
in
the
west
do
you
refer
to
me
when
you
say
that
puss
he
asked
with
that
same
queer
little
smile
on
his
face
a
look
that
mystified
the
other
who
could
not
understand
what
it
meant
yes
both
you
and
that
cousin
of
yours
just
because
luck
favored
you
and
you
won
that
blooming
race
by
a
head
you
think
i
manage
an
aeroplane
as
well
as
you
huh
perhaps
you
do
know
that
going
to
take
my
machine
with
me
when
i
go
down
to
the
cocoa
plantation
we
own
along
the
amazon
and
use
it
exploring
where
a
white
man
has
seldom
been
seen
you
can
just
stay
here
and
grow
up
with
the
country
while
i
doing
great
stunts
but
as
long
as
i
stay
here
i
going
to
stop
this
talk
about
trickery
and
dodges
you
responsible
for
most
of
it
frank
bird
i
warn
you
what
coming
to
you
perhaps
said
frank
pleasantly
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
also
when
this
awful
punishment
is
going
to
fall
on
my
poor
devoted
neck
any
time
hang
you
right
now
if
you
say
another
word
roared
puss
doubling
up
his
fists
and
making
ready
for
one
of
his
well
known
and
feared
bull
rushes
that
had
brought
him
a
speedy
victory
many
a
time
so
that
comforting
and
with
all
these
good
fellows
around
to
see
how
you
wipe
up
the
deck
with
me
suppose
you
begin
the
swabbing
act
puss
and
frank
pretended
to
throw
himself
in
a
position
of
defense
the
other
gave
utterance
to
a
hoarse
cry
of
rage
and
lowering
his
head
after
the
manner
of
a
bull
jumped
forward
but
the
agile
frank
simply
stepped
aside
and
unable
to
check
himself
in
time
puss
carberry
shot
over
the
side
of
the
power
boat
disappearing
in
the
clear
waters
of
sunrise
lake
with
a
great
splash
oh
shouted
his
crony
sandy
hollingshead
standing
there
as
if
petrified
and
puss
ca
swim
a
single
stroke
either
chapter
ii
frank
way
my
goodness
what
a
splash
served
him
right
that
what
he
gone
under
fellows
dove
just
like
a
big
frog
stop
the
boat
he
drown
half
a
dozen
were
shouting
in
unison
as
the
boys
crowded
to
the
side
over
which
the
bully
had
pitched
when
frank
avoided
his
forward
rush
but
frank
heard
only
that
startled
exclamation
from
sandy
hollingshead
puss
ca
swim
a
single
stroke
either
with
frank
bird
to
think
was
to
act
the
two
things
were
almost
synonymous
in
his
mind
forgotten
was
the
fact
that
the
imperiled
lad
had
been
endeavoring
to
strike
him
in
the
face
at
the
time
of
his
submersion
in
the
waters
of
sunrise
lake
not
a
single
word
did
he
utter
but
throwing
off
his
coat
he
made
a
leap
over
the
side
of
the
boat
already
slowing
up
as
the
power
was
cut
off
frank
gone
back
after
him
cried
one
and
he
get
him
too
another
hastened
to
say
for
they
understood
that
when
the
leader
of
the
team
known
as
the
bird
boys
attempted
anything
he
usually
got
there
as
some
of
them
said
with
both
feet
meanwhile
frank
was
swimming
with
all
his
might
toward
the
spot
in
the
foamy
wake
of
the
boat
where
he
knew
the
unfortunate
puss
must
be
battling
for
his
life
it
seems
strange
that
occasionally
a
boy
may
be
found
who
has
never
taken
the
trouble
to
learn
how
to
swim
in
the
country
this
is
a
rare
occurrence
which
would
make
the
neglect
of
such
an
athletic
fellow
as
puss
seem
more
remarkable
he
was
threshing
about
in
the
deep
water
like
a
cat
that
has
fallen
overboard
and
managing
to
keep
partly
afloat
after
a
fashion
though
it
would
have
been
all
over
with
him
long
ere
the
power
boat
could
be
turned
around
and
arrive
at
the
spot
where
he
struggled
gasping
for
breath
and
sucking
in
much
water
frank
was
wise
enough
to
understand
that
it
is
always
desirable
to
approach
a
drowning
person
from
the
rear
so
that
a
grip
may
be
taken
before
the
rescuer
presence
is
discovered
once
let
those
frenzied
fingers
clutch
hold
of
him
and
the
chances
of
a
double
tragedy
would
be
good
so
frank
was
keenly
on
the
watch
as
he
swam
toward
the
splashing
and
gurgling
that
announced
puss
carberry
fight
for
his
life
he
could
see
him
by
now
and
never
would
frank
be
apt
to
forget
the
look
of
absolute
terror
he
discovered
upon
the
agonized
face
of
the
bully
puss
had
detected
the
presence
of
some
one
near
by
and
was
trying
to
shout
as
well
as
stretch
his
appealing
hands
out
though
not
with
much
success
he
actually
went
under
while
frank
looked
and
the
heart
of
the
rescuer
almost
stood
still
with
a
terrible
fear
that
that
was
the
end
but
he
kept
on
and
in
another
moment
a
head
once
more
bobbed
up
with
puss
threshing
the
water
frantically
once
he
had
gone
down
according
to
what
most
people
said
he
would
possibly
vanish
twice
more
and
after
that
never
rise
again
if
anything
was
to
be
done
there
was
no
time
for
delay
frank
was
within
ten
feet
of
the
struggling
figure
when
it
came
up
he
immediately
dove
and
managed
to
rise
to
the
surface
behind
puss
then
just
as
the
other
was
floundering
beneath
the
surface
of
the
agitated
water
again
frank
caught
hold
of
his
sweater
close
to
his
neck
and
held
on
with
might
and
main
he
had
a
serious
job
of
it
for
the
lad
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
turn
around
doubtless
with
the
intention
of
throwing
his
arms
around
his
rescuer
this
was
just
what
frank
was
desirous
of
avoiding
he
simply
wanted
to
keep
the
head
of
puss
above
water
until
the
boat
could
come
and
willing
hands
be
stretched
down
to
relieve
him
of
his
burden
so
he
kept
treading
water
and
fighting
puss
off
as
best
he
was
able
it
was
no
easy
task
since
he
still
had
his
baseball
shoes
on
and
swimming
in
one
clothes
is
always
a
difficult
proposition
but
frank
knew
no
such
word
as
fail
and
continued
to
strive
keeping
one
eye
on
puss
and
the
other
on
the
approaching
power
boat
steady
now
puss
he
kept
saying
again
and
again
trying
to
instill
some
sense
in
the
head
of
the
frantic
boy
who
still
believed
he
must
be
going
down
again
keep
your
breath
in
your
lungs
and
you
float
do
kick
so
i
going
to
hold
you
up
till
the
boys
come
it
all
right
puss
you
safe
all
the
same
frank
was
mighty
well
pleased
when
the
launch
did
swing
close
alongside
and
half
a
dozen
hands
reached
out
to
clutch
hold
of
them
both
puss
first
fellows
he
said
with
a
half
laugh
i
can
crawl
in
myself
i
guess
but
they
would
not
hear
of
it
so
willing
hands
lifted
him
up
as
soon
as
the
other
dripping
figure
had
been
deposited
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
frank
made
light
of
the
adventure
after
his
usual
style
oh
come
let
up
on
that
he
remarked
when
some
of
the
fellows
were
patting
him
on
the
back
and
calling
him
a
hero
and
all
such
things
that
were
particularly
disagreeable
to
frank
it
was
just
a
cinch
to
me
you
know
i
half
a
water
spaniel
anyway
besides
if
it
had
been
for
the
way
i
riled
him
puss
would
have
fallen
overboard
drop
it
please
by
the
time
the
boat
reached
the
landing
near
the
dock
where
the
lake
steamer
touched
puss
seemed
to
have
discharged
his
cargo
of
water
swallowed
unintentionally
he
made
his
appearance
with
several
cronies
clustered
about
him
frank
was
not
the
one
to
hold
a
grudge
besides
he
had
come
out
of
the
affair
with
flying
colors
and
had
nothing
to
regret
so
he
strode
up
to
puss
at
once
holding
out
his
hand
every
boy
on
board
crowded
around
eager
to
see
how
the
bully
would
behave
for
they
knew
his
natural
disposition
and
wondered
whether
any
sort
of
miracle
had
been
wrought
in
his
disposition
because
of
his
recent
submersion
i
hope
you
feeling
all
right
now
puss
frank
said
pleasantly
i
wanted
to
ask
your
pardon
for
treating
you
so
roughly
but
knowing
you
could
swim
i
was
afraid
that
if
you
closed
with
me
we
both
go
down
but
you
struck
me
once
right
in
the
face
you
coward
exclaimed
the
other
as
he
put
his
still
trembling
hand
up
to
where
a
bruise
of
some
sort
could
be
seen
yes
i
admit
it
returned
frank
quickly
and
that
was
what
i
wanted
to
apologize
for
you
grabbed
me
and
it
was
the
only
way
i
could
break
your
hold
i
been
told
by
life
savers
that
often
they
have
to
strike
a
man
and
knock
him
senseless
to
save
themselves
from
being
dragged
down
you
must
understand
that
it
was
no
time
to
be
particular
i
had
to
save
myself
in
order
to
help
you
the
other
stared
hard
at
him
evidently
puss
had
not
yet
entirely
recovered
after
his
close
call
at
any
rate
it
was
positive
that
he
could
not
understand
how
he
actually
owed
his
very
life
to
the
speedy
action
of
this
boy
whom
he
hated
so
bitterly
they
saw
him
shake
his
head
much
as
a
dog
might
that
is
worrying
a
rat
well
you
only
undid
your
own
dirty
work
you
pushed
me
in
and
then
you
got
cold
feet
for
fear
that
i
drown
and
you
be
hung
you
jumped
in
to
do
your
usual
grandstand
act
of
hero
did
i
hear
these
softies
calling
you
that
right
now
no
i
do
want
to
touch
your
hand
keep
your
friendship
for
those
who
can
appreciate
it
there
a
long
account
between
us
that
going
to
be
settled
some
fine
day
and
with
these
ungrateful
words
puss
carberry
strode
off
the
boat
surrounded
by
his
cronies
who
were
doubtless
pleased
with
the
course
of
things
well
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
base
ingratitude
in
all
your
born
days
exclaimed
larry
geohegan
making
a
gesture
of
supreme
disgust
and
to
think
of
the
skunk
saying
frank
pushed
him
in
echoed
elephant
when
he
actually
risked
his
life
to
save
the
cur
ai
i
glad
now
i
did
carry
out
my
first
impulse
and
jump
after
puss
even
before
frank
went
why
maybe
he
have
even
said
i
tried
to
drown
him
the
idea
of
that
proverbial
slow
coach
of
an
elephant
ever
doing
anything
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
was
really
too
much
for
the
rest
of
the
boys
and
a
general
roar
went
up
do
bother
your
heads
about
me
fellows
remarked
frank
quietly
when
the
laughter
had
ceased
again
that
was
just
about
the
kind
of
treatment
i
should
have
expected
to
get
from
puss
carberry
still
i
not
sorry
i
did
it
life
would
seem
very
tame
without
that
schemer
around
to
try
and
liven
things
up
for
me
but
i
hardly
expected
him
to
accuse
me
of
pushing
him
in
when
all
i
did
was
to
step
aside
and
avoid
a
blow
at
his
hands
forget
it
please
he
walked
off
with
his
cousin
andy
who
had
been
boiling
over
at
the
time
the
rescued
puss
made
his
astonishing
accusation
would
that
jar
you
some
now
remarked
andy
after
his
customary
fashion
i
suppose
you
referring
to
the
way
puss
turned
on
me
after
i
went
and
got
my
baseball
suit
wet
just
to
give
him
a
helping
hand
laughed
frank
good
naturedly
oh
i
do
bear
any
malice
perhaps
he
was
still
a
little
stunned
by
that
knock
i
gave
him
but
i
thought
he
was
going
to
get
his
arms
around
my
neck
you
see
and
then
it
would
be
all
up
with
us
both
it
worked
too
for
he
was
as
limp
as
a
dishrag
from
that
time
on
remember
it
andy
in
case
you
ever
jump
over
after
puss
me
after
that
snake
why
hang
it
i
see
him
in
guinea
before
ever
lift
a
hand
to
save
him
i
tell
you
i
i
stammered
the
indignant
andy
i
do
believe
it
of
you
declared
his
cousin
quickly
you
may
think
you
stand
by
and
see
him
drown
but
that
all
gammon
i
know
you
too
well
to
believe
you
half
as
vindictive
as
you
try
to
make
out
but
did
you
hear
what
he
said
about
going
down
there
to
south
america
visiting
a
plantation
his
mother
partly
owns
and
taking
his
biplane
along
with
him
andy
was
all
excitement
now
sure
i
did
he
said
and
ten
to
one
he
learned
somehow
that
we
thought
of
going
down
in
that
region
for
another
purpose
it
would
be
just
like
puss
and
that
sneak
of
a
sandy
hollingshead
to
try
and
beat
us
out
that
fellow
would
mind
a
trip
to
the
other
end
of
the
world
if
he
thought
he
could
get
your
goat
frank
he
hates
you
like
poison
pity
you
did
feel
a
cramp
just
when
you
were
swimming
to
him
not
enough
to
endanger
your
own
life
you
see
but
sort
of
make
you
stop
short
shame
on
you
andy
remarked
frank
i
hope
i
always
carry
myself
so
that
i
wo
be
afraid
to
look
at
myself
in
a
glass
but
what
do
you
know
about
that
place
did
he
call
it
a
cocoa
plantation
or
something
of
the
kind
yes
replied
the
other
moodily
i
was
told
that
his
mother
owned
of
some
such
place
along
the
amazon
or
somewhere
down
there
but
let
them
go
it
a
tremendous
big
country
and
there
the
least
danger
that
we
ever
butt
into
them
if
we
decide
to
take
a
run
down
still
observed
the
taller
lad
thoughtfully
you
never
can
know
i
heard
travelers
say
that
sometimes
the
world
seems
to
be
very
small
when
you
meet
your
next
door
neighbor
on
the
top
of
some
swiss
mountain
puss
may
know
nothing
about
your
plans
and
this
is
perhaps
only
a
coincidence
as
they
say
since
he
has
had
such
poor
luck
getting
to
the
top
of
our
mountains
around
here
he
wants
to
try
his
hand
on
those
poor
south
american
andes
andy
father
had
been
a
professor
in
one
of
the
colleges
who
having
taken
up
aeronautics
had
made
many
balloon
voyages
in
quest
of
scientific
information
so
that
his
name
had
become
quite
famous
then
about
a
year
before
he
had
been
lost
when
attempting
to
solve
the
air
currents
on
the
panama
isthmus
where
the
government
had
thirty
thousand
laborers
digging
the
big
ditch
nothing
had
ever
been
heard
of
the
professor
from
the
day
he
started
from
the
atlantic
side
of
the
isthmus
intending
to
cross
the
mountains
and
land
on
the
pacific
beach
and
it
was
becoming
a
positive
mania
in
the
mind
of
andy
who
lived
with
his
guardian
colonel
josiah
whympers
to
some
day
go
down
there
and
follow
in
the
track
of
his
lost
father
in
the
hope
of
discovering
his
sad
fate
it
was
with
this
idea
in
mind
that
he
had
united
his
forces
with
inventive
genius
and
helped
build
the
monoplane
with
which
they
had
won
the
race
to
the
top
of
the
neighboring
mountain
during
old
home
week
at
bloomsbury
and
every
day
he
was
thinking
more
and
more
of
what
strange
things
the
future
might
have
in
store
for
him
if
he
ever
started
on
that
exploring
venture
chapter
iii
something
about
the
bird
boys
how
about
coming
over
tonight
asked
frank
as
the
boys
halted
at
the
gate
of
bird
place
where
andy
had
gone
to
get
his
wheel
since
he
lived
some
little
distance
away
i
like
to
first
rate
frank
because
there
are
some
things
i
want
to
talk
over
with
you
but
i
promised
colonel
josiah
to
get
at
his
books
tonight
and
straighten
them
out
it
take
me
all
evening
i
reckon
oh
well
remarked
frank
see
you
in
the
morning
anyway
this
breeze
will
have
worn
itself
out
by
then
perhaps
and
if
we
feel
like
it
we
can
take
a
little
trip
somewhere
in
the
as
you
like
to
call
our
dandy
little
aeroplane
i
hope
so
replied
andy
eagerly
it
been
some
days
now
since
we
were
up
and
i
more
than
curious
to
find
out
if
that
new
arrangement
of
yours
is
going
to
help
us
any
in
getting
a
quick
start
does
the
colonel
still
persist
in
having
old
shea
sleep
outside
the
shed
asked
the
other
as
andy
pushed
in
to
get
his
wheel
out
from
under
a
side
porch
where
he
had
thrust
it
before
starting
off
to
the
baseball
game
sure
came
the
reply
when
colonel
josiah
once
starts
on
a
thing
it
would
take
an
earthquake
to
stop
him
i
tried
to
tell
him
that
there
was
no
danger
of
our
monoplane
being
injured
now
that
those
two
men
who
robbed
the
jewelry
store
were
locked
up
at
police
headquarters
waiting
for
some
formality
to
start
them
on
the
road
to
a
sentence
but
he
only
shook
his
head
and
said
shea
had
nothing
else
to
do
and
might
as
well
be
earning
his
salt
the
incident
to
which
andy
referred
was
related
at
length
in
the
preceding
volume
of
this
series
the
bird
boys
or
the
young
sky
pilots
first
air
voyage
and
had
created
a
ten
days
sensation
in
the
quiet
little
lake
town
of
bloomsbury
two
rogues
had
robbed
the
extensive
jewelry
establishment
of
leffingwell
and
carried
off
the
loot
in
a
couple
of
suit
cases
taken
from
the
store
unable
to
get
clear
away
on
account
of
a
quick
chase
they
had
hidden
in
the
vicinity
of
the
town
one
of
them
named
jules
had
been
an
aviator
at
some
time
in
his
near
past
over
in
france
and
learning
that
the
bird
boys
had
built
a
monoplane
which
was
even
then
ready
for
a
flight
they
had
attempted
to
steal
the
same
with
the
intention
of
giving
their
pursuers
who
were
hunting
the
woods
for
them
the
laugh
but
their
well
laid
plans
were
spoiled
through
the
vigilance
of
the
bird
boys
and
the
quick
wit
of
frank
in
particular
the
consequence
was
that
both
men
were
eventually
captured
by
chief
waller
and
his
officers
and
still
languished
in
the
town
awaiting
the
day
of
trial
oh
well
laughed
frank
as
his
cousin
wheeled
his
bike
out
to
the
front
gate
where
he
could
mount
better
it
makes
mighty
little
difference
because
from
what
i
seen
of
shea
i
imagine
he
sleeps
on
his
post
i
glad
we
did
let
him
inside
because
like
all
irishmen
he
is
fond
of
his
pipe
and
might
have
set
fire
to
the
shed
dangerous
smoking
where
there
a
lot
of
gasoline
about
of
course
we
got
that
puss
carberry
and
his
mean
crony
sandy
hollingshead
to
consider
they
tried
to
injure
our
machine
once
and
might
again
especially
after
what
happened
today
said
andy
throwing
one
leg
over
his
saddle
and
standing
there
a
minute
oh
i
guess
not
andy
they
understand
that
we
keeping
tabs
of
that
hangar
with
its
precious
contents
besides
they
got
their
hands
full
of
other
matters
if
what
puss
said
about
that
big
trip
to
the
amazon
country
is
true
the
other
sighed
i
only
wish
i
was
as
sure
of
going
down
there
as
puss
seems
to
be
he
observed
i
do
know
how
it
is
but
something
queer
seems
to
be
drawing
me
that
way
day
and
night
i
have
pictures
rising
in
my
mind
i
read
every
scrap
concerning
the
isthmus
and
northern
coast
of
south
america
until
i
guess
i
as
well
posted
on
such
things
as
one
who
had
been
there
yes
said
frank
softly
and
i
afraid
you
let
your
mind
dwell
too
much
on
that
subject
old
chum
it
more
than
a
year
now
since
your
father
disappeared
and
the
chances
of
your
ever
finding
what
became
of
him
are
like
searching
for
a
lost
diamond
in
the
sand
of
the
seashore
it
affecting
your
mind
andy
you
look
all
fagged
out
i
wish
you
could
cheer
up
and
be
something
like
your
old
self
but
the
other
only
shook
his
head
sadly
i
do
believe
i
ever
can
frank
until
i
had
my
chance
to
go
down
there
and
make
a
good
try
to
find
all
that
is
left
of
my
poor
father
just
as
you
say
it
seems
almost
silly
to
think
that
i
could
ever
succeed
but
no
matter
i
got
it
arranged
in
my
mind
and
the
colonel
is
coming
around
slowly
well
frank
hastened
to
declare
you
know
if
it
ever
does
get
to
the
point
that
you
do
go
down
to
make
that
search
i
with
you
my
father
would
never
throw
any
obstacle
in
the
way
i
dead
sure
and
andy
of
course
we
take
our
aeroplane
along
think
how
many
trips
we
could
make
in
her
over
country
that
no
one
could
ever
penetrate
on
foot
andy
was
too
full
for
further
words
he
simply
turned
and
squeezed
the
hand
of
his
cousin
but
the
look
of
affection
which
he
gave
frank
told
what
was
in
his
mind
just
then
frank
watched
him
go
spinning
along
the
road
and
then
with
a
sigh
turned
into
the
house
the
day
had
been
replete
with
excitement
for
him
first
there
was
the
keenly
contested
game
with
their
rivals
across
the
lake
and
a
tie
in
the
ninth
inning
which
gave
the
bloomsbury
boys
a
chance
to
win
out
in
the
tenth
his
pitching
had
held
the
enemy
safe
and
in
their
half
of
the
inning
frank
had
made
the
hit
that
brought
the
game
to
a
conclusion
as
a
rule
the
home
club
took
the
last
chance
at
the
bat
but
the
cranford
manager
had
chosen
differently
on
this
occasion
for
some
reason
of
his
own
and
with
disastrous
results
then
on
the
way
home
had
come
that
little
diversion
aboard
the
launch
when
his
old
enemy
puss
carberry
in
attempting
to
strike
him
had
miscalculated
and
gone
plunging
into
the
lake
himself
being
unable
to
swim
frank
had
nothing
to
regret
in
connection
with
his
leap
after
the
struggling
lad
and
his
subsequent
saving
of
puss
true
the
latter
chose
to
crush
down
the
natural
spirit
of
gratitude
that
should
have
made
him
accept
the
hand
frank
offered
later
but
frank
felt
that
he
could
afford
to
smile
at
such
an
exhibition
of
a
small
nature
at
the
supper
table
his
father
and
janet
his
sister
just
home
from
boarding
school
a
couple
of
weeks
back
plied
him
with
questions
concerning
the
game
of
course
the
girl
had
been
present
and
had
seen
her
brother
carry
off
the
honors
on
the
diamond
but
there
were
lots
of
things
she
wanted
explained
and
before
frank
knew
it
he
was
asked
point
blank
what
had
happened
on
the
way
across
the
lake
for
janet
had
been
aboard
another
boat
it
seemed
marjorie
lee
told
me
she
heard
that
you
jumped
overboard
to
save
some
one
she
did
just
know
who
was
what
janet
said
and
the
good
doctor
pricked
up
his
ears
as
he
looked
inquiringly
toward
the
boy
of
whom
he
was
so
proud
frank
turned
red
and
then
laughed
oh
pshaw
he
said
i
had
hoped
that
would
be
kept
quiet
but
some
of
the
fellows
like
to
talk
too
much
who
was
it
you
jumped
over
after
they
said
you
held
him
up
until
the
boat
got
around
that
he
could
not
swim
a
stroke
and
must
surely
have
drowned
only
for
your
prompt
action
it
could
have
been
cousin
andy
because
he
can
swim
nearly
as
well
as
you
tell
us
frank
janet
persisted
so
frank
found
himself
compelled
to
relate
the
whole
circumstance
in
his
usual
generous
manner
he
tried
to
gloss
over
the
conduct
of
puss
and
spoke
as
though
the
other
had
tumbled
overboard
during
a
little
boyish
roughhouse
business
but
janet
knew
of
the
enmity
between
the
pair
and
she
could
read
between
the
lines
frank
spent
a
couple
of
hours
after
supper
in
poring
over
a
book
andy
had
loaned
him
and
it
might
easily
be
assumed
that
it
had
to
do
with
the
birds
animals
fauna
and
inhabitants
of
that
great
country
lying
north
of
the
equator
down
in
central
and
south
america
it
was
about
nine
when
his
father
called
to
him
the
doctor
had
just
come
in
from
a
few
last
visits
and
looked
anxious
frank
i
in
a
peck
of
trouble
he
said
with
a
whimsical
smile
and
i
wish
you
could
help
me
out
though
i
dislike
putting
you
to
so
much
trouble
oh
do
mind
that
dad
one
little
bit
you
know
i
only
too
glad
to
be
of
any
assistance
to
you
what
gone
wrong
now
machine
laid
off
again
and
garage
closed
but
you
wo
need
it
till
nine
tomorrow
will
you
there
was
a
world
of
affection
in
the
very
way
frank
used
that
word
dad
it
might
seem
disrespectful
coming
from
the
lips
of
many
boys
but
to
the
ears
of
the
good
doctor
it
was
as
sweetest
music
that
the
trouble
frank
i
do
need
some
means
of
getting
around
tonight
the
worst
kind
fact
is
the
car
broke
down
just
as
i
got
it
in
the
yard
same
old
trouble
and
will
take
an
hour
to
fix
it
up
and
all
at
once
it
dawned
on
me
that
i
had
forgotten
to
take
the
medicine
out
to
farmer
lovejoy
which
i
surely
promised
tonight
it
lies
under
the
seat
of
the
machine
slipped
my
mind
entirely
when
i
was
out
and
frank
there
may
be
a
serious
turn
to
that
child
sickness
unless
that
medicine
gets
there
within
the
next
hour
or
so
do
say
another
word
dad
declared
frank
jumping
up
and
getting
his
cap
my
wheel
is
in
fine
shape
and
with
a
good
lantern
i
can
make
the
run
in
a
jiffy
only
too
glad
to
be
able
to
help
out
the
packet
is
under
the
seat
in
the
car
and
you
left
that
in
the
side
yard
all
right
i
off
chapter
iv
a
startling
discovery
it
did
not
take
frank
many
minutes
to
get
started
on
his
little
trip
as
he
had
said
his
wheel
was
in
good
shape
with
neither
tire
needing
any
pumping
up
and
even
his
acetylene
headlight
had
only
to
be
attached
which
task
took
but
a
short
time
i
declare
he
exclaimed
as
he
rested
his
wheel
against
the
gate
and
turned
back
that
would
have
been
a
rough
joke
on
me
if
i
gone
spinning
off
and
only
remembered
after
i
almost
got
there
that
i
forgot
to
take
the
package
of
medicine
out
of
dad
little
runabout
so
much
for
having
my
brain
full
of
that
wonderful
scheme
of
andy
he
found
the
medicine
and
as
the
packet
turned
out
to
be
small
enough
to
be
stowed
away
in
one
of
his
coat
pockets
frank
so
disposed
of
it
then
wheeling
his
machine
out
into
the
road
he
took
a
last
look
at
the
lantern
to
see
that
the
water
might
not
be
dripping
on
the
carbide
too
rapidly
to
combine
the
greatest
efficiency
after
that
he
swung
into
the
saddle
starting
off
with
the
perfect
freedom
that
proclaims
the
rider
a
master
of
his
wheel
once
he
passed
out
of
town
frank
made
good
progress
he
had
a
ride
of
several
miles
before
him
ere
he
could
expect
to
reach
the
farmhouse
of
jason
lovejoy
one
of
his
father
oldest
customers
and
friends
there
was
no
help
from
the
moon
because
the
sky
had
clouded
up
and
screened
the
young
queen
of
the
skies
but
frank
needed
no
other
light
than
the
brilliant
glow
that
spread
out
along
the
road
ahead
of
him
coming
from
his
lamp
it
happened
that
he
passed
the
home
of
colonel
josiah
whympers
the
retired
and
lame
traveler
in
whose
care
andy
had
been
left
by
the
will
which
his
father
had
made
before
starting
on
what
had
proven
his
last
air
voyage
guess
andy
gone
to
bed
he
mused
as
he
saw
the
house
wrapped
in
darkness
for
it
was
now
after
half
past
nine
frank
cast
a
glance
back
toward
the
big
field
where
the
shed
stood
in
which
the
great
little
monoplane
in
which
they
had
won
their
victory
during
old
home
week
was
stored
but
he
could
just
barely
make
it
out
owing
to
the
distance
and
the
faint
light
of
the
moon
coming
through
the
clouds
naturally
the
hearts
of
both
lads
went
out
toward
the
gallant
aircraft
which
had
answered
every
call
made
upon
it
for
speed
and
endurance
it
was
equipped
with
an
engine
of
the
latest
make
weighing
only
a
third
as
much
as
the
average
aeroplane
motor
and
a
triumph
of
modern
scientific
discovery
since
the
bird
boys
had
constructed
that
monoplane
themselves
after
patterns
obtained
elsewhere
surely
they
had
reason
to
be
proud
of
their
work
and
the
gallant
victory
which
had
come
to
them
frank
pedaled
on
thinking
nothing
of
the
trip
he
was
accustomed
to
being
abroad
at
night
with
his
wheel
and
indeed
had
taken
many
a
run
by
the
light
of
his
lamp
alone
what
was
there
to
fear
bloomsbury
was
a
peaceful
community
rarely
did
anything
occur
to
indicate
that
a
spirit
of
lawlessness
was
abroad
occasionally
the
police
had
some
trouble
with
wandering
tramps
but
chief
waller
strong
point
seemed
to
lie
in
that
direction
and
as
a
rule
hoboes
gave
bloomsbury
a
wide
berth
the
word
had
gone
out
that
they
made
stragglers
when
caught
there
and
nothing
could
be
more
horrible
in
the
eyes
of
these
wandering
willies
after
passing
andy
home
it
was
not
more
than
twelve
minutes
before
frank
found
himself
approaching
the
quiet
farmhouse
where
he
was
to
leave
the
medicine
the
doctor
had
told
him
to
ask
a
number
of
questions
with
regard
to
the
little
sufferer
and
frank
was
well
enough
up
in
medicine
to
know
what
to
say
when
he
learned
how
matters
were
going
a
big
watchdog
boomed
his
hoarse
bark
upon
the
night
air
as
frank
dropped
off
his
wheel
at
the
gate
where
the
mail
box
was
fastened
hello
kaiser
good
dog
do
you
know
me
old
fellow
come
here
and
be
friends
kaiser
it
all
right
i
coming
in
frank
knew
how
to
use
a
wheedling
voice
that
a
dog
instantly
recognized
as
belonging
to
a
friend
besides
instinct
doubtless
told
kaiser
that
any
one
who
had
evil
intentions
would
come
sneaking
around
and
not
in
this
bold
fashion
at
any
rate
the
big
mastiff
began
to
wag
his
tail
and
though
he
still
barked
it
was
by
way
of
a
welcome
now
frank
fearlessly
opened
the
gate
and
walked
in
the
guardian
of
the
farm
came
up
to
him
sniffing
and
frank
without
hesitation
rubbed
his
hand
over
the
shaggy
head
of
kaiser
so
side
by
side
they
advanced
to
the
house
already
a
door
had
opened
showing
farmer
lovejoy
with
a
lamp
in
his
hand
evidently
they
had
been
anxiously
waiting
for
the
coming
of
the
good
doctor
and
were
possibly
beginning
to
worry
because
he
had
failed
as
yet
to
show
up
with
the
medicine
he
had
promised
it
you
frank
is
it
asked
the
farmer
as
the
lad
drew
near
the
stoop
yes
sir
replied
the
boy
cheerily
his
machine
broke
down
and
i
had
to
come
on
my
wheel
but
father
said
it
was
very
important
that
you
have
this
medicine
tonight
he
expects
great
things
of
it
by
morning
well
said
farmer
lovejoy
warmly
that
was
right
nice
of
you
to
come
all
this
way
on
your
wheel
frank
but
i
guess
it
what
expect
from
doc
bird
boy
i
saw
ye
make
that
trip
up
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
in
your
airship
frank
i
tell
ye
it
was
wuth
seein
you
come
in
the
missus
like
to
see
ye
why
yes
i
will
because
dad
asked
me
to
explain
something
to
you
and
also
get
some
information
about
sue
a
few
minutes
will
make
little
difference
frank
said
but
although
he
did
not
suspect
it
just
then
even
seconds
came
very
near
being
of
the
greatest
importance
perhaps
he
spent
all
of
ten
minutes
in
the
lovejoy
home
and
in
that
time
learned
what
his
father
wished
to
know
the
old
farmer
came
to
the
door
with
him
shaking
hands
warmly
once
again
i
say
i
obliged
to
ye
frank
he
remarked
with
feeling
for
comin
away
out
here
to
fetch
the
medicine
it
may
be
the
means
of
savin
our
gal
to
us
who
knows
but
i
got
faith
in
your
father
if
anybody
kin
fetch
our
sue
around
he
will
good
night
lad
kaiser
mind
your
manners
this
is
one
of
the
best
friends
we
got
oh
that
all
right
sir
declared
frank
quickly
as
he
patted
the
shaggy
head
of
the
big
mastiff
we
understand
each
other
do
we
old
boy
he
knew
my
voice
because
a
dog
never
forgets
a
friend
and
played
with
him
many
the
time
good
night
lovejoy
keep
up
your
spirits
dad
says
sue
is
going
to
get
over
this
all
right
in
a
little
time
once
again
on
the
road
he
turned
his
face
toward
home
after
all
this
six
or
run
was
only
a
good
touch
of
exercise
and
he
would
sleep
all
the
sounder
on
account
of
it
besides
frank
loved
nothing
better
than
to
do
something
for
the
parent
who
all
his
life
had
been
so
indulgent
to
him
as
he
pedaled
along
keeping
his
eyes
well
ahead
so
as
to
glimpse
any
vehicle
that
might
loom
up
in
his
path
he
was
thinking
of
what
andy
had
in
mind
while
the
project
was
as
yet
rather
uncertain
frank
seemed
to
feel
that
his
cousin
could
never
be
wholly
satisfied
that
he
had
done
his
duty
by
his
father
until
he
had
spent
some
time
down
on
the
isthmus
trying
to
get
some
traces
of
the
lost
aeronaut
i
reckon
i
ought
to
know
something
of
andy
persistence
he
said
to
himself
with
a
chuckle
and
now
that
he
got
this
bee
in
his
bonnet
there
be
no
peace
until
he
tries
the
scheme
out
sure
i
with
him
from
the
word
go
it
makes
me
shiver
all
over
with
expectation
just
to
think
of
what
glorious
times
we
two
chums
might
have
hello
something
ahead
and
i
better
slow
up
it
proved
to
be
a
farm
wagon
pulled
by
two
tired
nags
and
headed
for
home
after
a
day
in
the
town
market
the
driver
was
asleep
on
the
seat
leaving
to
the
sagacity
of
his
animals
the
successful
navigation
of
the
road
perhaps
some
movement
of
the
horses
or
else
the
bright
light
of
the
acetylene
headlight
falling
on
his
face
aroused
the
man
for
he
sat
up
as
frank
was
about
passing
hello
is
that
you
frank
bird
he
asked
leaning
forward
to
look
closer
at
the
rider
of
the
bicycle
sure
just
been
up
to
your
neighbor
lovejoy
with
some
medicine
for
his
sue
returned
the
boy
recognizing
the
farmer
how
is
the
gal
gettin
on
called
the
other
over
the
canvas
top
of
his
seat
fine
no
danger
dad
says
answered
frank
that
good
he
heard
the
sympathetic
neighbor
remark
as
he
moved
on
five
minutes
later
and
frank
once
more
found
himself
approaching
the
whympers
place
as
before
the
house
was
in
complete
darkness
as
if
the
inmates
were
long
since
abed
frank
knew
that
the
old
man
kept
early
hours
seldom
sitting
up
for
he
read
much
during
the
day
having
nothing
else
to
look
after
then
as
was
only
natural
the
eyes
of
the
bicycle
boy
turned
once
again
with
more
or
less
affection
toward
the
quarter
where
he
could
just
dimly
make
out
the
long
squat
shed
out
in
the
field
in
which
the
precious
monoplane
was
stored
as
he
did
so
frank
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
why
there
a
light
over
by
the
hangar
he
burst
out
now
what
under
the
sun
do
you
suppose
that
old
fool
of
a
shea
can
be
doing
oh
my
look
at
the
flame
jump
up
why
as
sure
as
you
live
i
believe
the
shed
afire
and
i
can
see
the
figure
of
a
man
moving
about
this
is
no
accident
but
something
worse
and
it
looks
as
if
the
little
might
be
going
up
in
smoke
in
a
jiffy
unless
i
can
sprawl
over
the
fence
here
and
get
on
the
spot
mighty
quick
chapter
a
warm
five
minutes
fire
fire
so
frank
shouted
even
as
he
jumped
over
the
fence
and
made
a
bee
line
for
the
center
of
the
big
field
where
the
shed
lay
in
which
the
precious
monoplane
was
stored
he
had
hastily
leaned
his
bicycle
against
the
fence
as
he
made
the
plunge
nor
did
he
cease
to
let
out
constant
yells
while
running
across
the
open
as
fast
as
his
agile
legs
could
carry
him
twice
he
tripped
over
some
object
and
nearly
fell
only
to
recover
himself
and
speed
on
as
he
ran
he
kept
his
eyes
upon
the
low
building
beyond
in
this
manner
he
plainly
saw
the
stooping
figure
of
a
man
or
boy
making
off
in
a
roundabout
way
so
as
to
avoid
him
frank
heart
was
burning
with
indignation
because
of
this
dastardly
attempt
to
ruin
the
gallant
little
airship
that
had
so
nobly
stood
all
tests
and
proven
itself
a
splendid
piece
of
workmanship
oh
the
contemptible
coward
i
just
like
to
chase
after
him
and
get
my
hands
on
him
once
was
the
thought
that
passed
through
his
brain
but
he
knew
he
could
not
the
scoundrel
no
matter
who
it
was
must
be
allowed
to
escape
in
order
that
he
turn
his
attention
to
the
burning
shed
and
try
to
save
the
airship
from
destruction
once
the
fire
got
inside
there
was
enough
of
the
dangerous
gasoline
about
to
insure
the
speedy
burning
of
the
whole
flimsy
fabric
all
but
the
motor
itself
so
frank
kept
headed
straight
for
the
hangar
trying
to
shut
out
the
sight
of
that
crouching
fleeing
figure
he
continued
to
lift
his
sturdy
young
voice
in
repeated
shouts
fire
fire
those
in
the
house
must
hear
yes
and
the
neighbors
too
he
might
not
be
able
to
master
the
flames
alone
and
single
handed
and
would
need
help
besides
it
was
only
right
that
andy
being
part
owner
in
the
monoplane
should
be
made
aware
of
its
sudden
peril
as
he
thus
drew
near
the
low
building
he
saw
that
the
fire
had
already
gained
considerable
headway
just
as
if
the
incendiary
might
have
used
kerosene
or
some
other
inflammable
fluid
to
hasten
matters
frank
heart
grew
cold
as
ice
as
he
contemplated
the
rapidity
with
which
those
hungry
flames
were
crawling
up
the
dry
boards
that
constituted
the
side
of
the
shed
but
he
did
not
lose
his
head
in
this
sudden
crisis
it
was
characteristic
of
frank
bird
that
no
matter
what
the
emergency
he
was
always
cool
enough
to
think
out
the
proper
thing
to
be
done
or
else
jump
at
it
through
instinct
and
frank
had
foreseen
just
some
such
possible
need
as
this
he
even
kept
several
buckets
of
moist
sand
handy
where
it
could
be
snatched
up
at
a
second
warning
knowing
that
most
fires
can
be
smothered
when
quenching
them
with
water
is
out
of
the
question
the
buckets
he
gasped
as
he
arrived
close
to
the
building
one
part
of
which
was
now
fairly
covered
with
the
creeping
tongues
of
ruddy
fire
i
must
use
them
on
it
he
had
to
turn
the
corner
of
the
shed
to
get
to
where
they
stood
and
as
he
did
so
he
ran
plump
into
a
figure
that
was
coming
toward
him
just
in
time
did
frank
dodge
a
big
fist
that
shot
out
and
in
that
second
he
recognized
in
the
other
shea
the
irishman
who
had
been
hired
to
keep
watch
of
the
shed
hold
on
shea
shouted
frank
it
me
frank
bird
somebody
has
set
fire
to
the
shed
grab
up
a
bucket
of
sand
and
carry
it
around
here
we
can
put
it
out
yet
if
we
busy
shea
had
evidently
only
been
aroused
from
a
sound
sleep
by
the
approaching
cries
of
the
boy
and
was
still
in
a
daze
he
had
discovered
the
fire
and
hearing
frank
running
toward
him
supposed
that
this
must
be
the
one
who
had
done
the
evil
deed
but
he
had
sense
enough
to
do
as
he
was
told
now
snatching
up
one
of
the
sand
buckets
and
following
the
boy
frank
immediately
commenced
fighting
the
flames
with
a
vim
he
slapped
the
wet
sand
at
the
creeping
fire
and
wherever
it
struck
there
seemed
to
come
a
quick
abatement
of
the
conflagration
but
it
was
by
this
time
so
extended
that
as
fast
as
he
succeeded
in
knocking
it
out
in
one
place
it
cropped
up
afresh
somewhere
else
his
ammunition
would
not
last
if
this
kept
up
get
busy
shea
he
cried
find
something
and
slap
at
the
fire
for
all
you
worth
fight
it
man
fight
it
as
frank
happened
to
turn
his
head
to
learn
what
the
other
was
doing
he
saw
something
that
made
very
little
impression
on
his
mind
just
then
but
which
had
considerable
bearing
on
the
matter
later
a
light
was
speeding
along
the
road
heading
away
from
town
and
frank
realized
that
the
firebug
had
seized
upon
his
convenient
wheel
and
was
making
his
escape
later
on
he
might
figure
out
the
meaning
of
this
movement
just
then
he
really
had
no
time
to
give
it
a
thought
no
matter
if
a
dozen
wheels
were
concerned
the
fire
demanded
every
atom
of
his
attention
shea
did
get
busy
once
he
became
stirred
up
and
he
proved
a
valuable
helper
he
went
for
the
flames
tooth
and
nail
smothered
them
with
his
coat
regardless
of
consequences
after
he
had
slipped
that
article
of
wearing
apparel
off
kicked
and
tore
and
fought
until
it
became
evident
that
between
them
they
were
certainly
making
a
decided
impression
on
the
threatening
conflagration
all
this
while
it
seemed
to
frank
that
his
heart
was
in
his
throat
not
so
much
because
he
feared
that
they
would
fail
to
gain
the
mastery
over
the
fire
as
that
some
spark
might
find
ingress
to
the
shed
and
happen
to
alight
upon
a
can
of
the
dangerous
gasoline
if
such
a
thing
occurred
he
knew
that
it
would
be
all
over
the
hangar
must
be
completely
destroyed
and
of
course
their
little
darling
airship
would
share
in
its
fate
so
even
though
he
saw
the
end
of
the
conflagration
in
sight
frank
knew
he
had
no
reason
to
breathe
easily
until
every
spark
had
been
trampled
under
foot
by
now
he
was
conscious
of
loud
shouts
coming
from
points
near
at
hand
and
realized
that
doubtless
andy
as
well
as
others
had
been
awakened
by
the
racket
and
were
coming
on
the
run
to
assist
had
the
safety
of
the
airship
depended
on
their
reaching
the
shed
in
time
though
its
chances
would
have
been
next
to
nothing
frank
was
just
stamping
on
what
seemed
to
be
the
very
last
vestige
of
the
fire
when
andy
came
galloping
to
his
side
all
this
mean
frank
where
in
the
wide
world
did
you
come
from
and
who
set
our
hangar
afire
he
gasped
almost
winded
from
his
exertions
for
he
had
dressed
in
about
a
minute
despite
his
trembling
fingers
and
was
barefooted
even
then
do
know
who
did
it
but
he
ran
off
on
my
wheel
a
few
minutes
ago
i
was
on
the
way
home
carrying
medicine
to
susie
lovejoy
saw
flames
and
gave
alarm
got
here
on
the
jump
and
we
managed
to
get
the
better
of
it
but
it
was
a
close
shave
all
right
i
tell
you
andy
frank
himself
had
no
breath
to
spare
nor
could
it
be
wondered
at
considering
the
recent
valiant
fight
which
he
had
made
against
big
odds
so
the
ornery
skunks
try
to
burn
us
out
after
all
burst
forth
the
other
part
owner
of
the
monoplane
bitterly
say
where
was
shea
all
this
time
what
use
was
he
as
a
watchman
he
helped
me
good
and
hard
at
any
rate
only
for
shea
i
never
have
got
the
better
of
it
i
afraid
said
frank
always
ready
to
cover
up
any
little
failing
on
the
part
of
another
though
never
hesitating
to
denounce
his
own
shortcomings
but
just
to
think
of
the
meanness
of
it
all
continued
andy
shaking
his
head
in
the
aggressive
way
he
had
that
puss
carberry
ought
to
be
shut
up
behind
bars
that
my
opinion
straight
from
the
shoulder
and
if
i
could
only
find
out
for
sure
that
he
was
in
this
i
get
colonel
josiah
to
prosecute
him
to
the
limit
but
we
have
no
proof
that
it
was
puss
remarked
frank
the
fellow
who
stole
my
wheel
went
off
along
the
road
from
town
and
he
went
licketty
split
too
as
if
he
had
business
over
in
shelby
or
newtown
perhaps
it
was
only
a
hobo
he
may
have
started
the
fire
by
accident
and
was
trying
to
put
it
out
when
i
saw
him
first
then
when
i
shouted
of
course
he
had
to
scoot
what
this
demanded
andy
kicking
some
object
and
then
seizing
hold
of
his
foot
for
he
had
forgotten
that
he
had
no
shoes
on
frank
uttered
a
cry
and
picked
it
up
look
here
do
you
recognize
this
he
asked
as
he
held
a
can
up
it
was
andy
turn
to
give
vent
to
a
low
exclamation
why
it
our
kerosene
can
frank
he
said
that
what
i
thought
and
it
is
kept
on
a
bench
just
outside
the
kitchen
door
is
it
demanded
the
other
quickly
that
a
fact
and
neither
of
us
ever
brought
it
here
shea
did
you
ever
see
this
oil
can
before
and
andy
dangled
it
before
the
eyes
of
the
watchman
who
had
slept
on
his
post
i
niver
did
the
same
sor
replied
the
man
as
he
surveyed
the
can
then
that
settles
it
frank
the
mean
skunk
grabbed
that
can
and
fetched
it
over
here
to
spray
the
wall
of
the
shed
with
oil
and
making
the
fire
jump
true
as
you
live
said
the
other
do
you
know
i
thought
i
smelled
burning
kerosene
and
that
was
why
the
flames
kept
crawling
up
everywhere
so
fast
well
it
was
a
good
job
that
we
saved
the
place
and
ai
i
glad
i
did
wait
just
five
minutes
longer
at
place
nothing
could
have
helped
then
and
we
just
have
to
build
another
airship
but
here
comes
the
colonel
stumping
along
andy
chapter
vi
in
search
of
a
clue
heigho
what
all
this
fuss
and
feathers
about
demanded
the
old
retired
traveler
as
he
came
limping
along
with
his
crutch
and
cane
several
neighbors
accompanied
him
having
been
aroused
by
the
clamor
same
old
story
sir
remarked
the
disgusted
andy
still
clutching
his
bruised
toe
tenderly
they
been
trying
to
beat
us
one
way
if
they
could
another
frank
gave
him
a
nudge
be
careful
what
you
say
andy
he
remarked
there
is
no
proof
as
yet
that
any
one
we
knew
had
a
hand
in
this
business
you
may
get
in
trouble
if
you
mention
names
offhand
go
slow
now
we
find
out
the
truth
later
on
perhaps
so
andy
taking
heed
managed
to
tell
what
had
happened
without
directly
accusing
any
one
nevertheless
it
was
not
difficult
for
those
who
listened
to
guess
where
his
suspicions
lay
and
perhaps
they
thought
after
all
that
had
occurred
in
the
past
with
the
hand
of
puss
carberry
moving
the
pieces
on
the
chessboard
that
andy
was
justified
in
believing
as
he
did
after
a
while
the
excitement
died
away
the
boys
had
opened
the
shed
and
made
sure
that
no
lingering
spark
remained
to
threaten
their
beloved
little
aeroplane
with
destruction
but
it
was
all
right
and
they
feasted
their
eyes
on
it
as
if
they
never
before
realized
how
precious
it
had
become
getting
to
be
a
regular
thing
seems
to
me
these
night
alarms
boys
remarked
one
of
the
neighbors
for
not
long
before
they
had
been
aroused
in
the
middle
of
the
night
when
the
two
jewelry
thieves
tried
to
steal
the
aeroplane
and
were
baffled
in
their
design
by
the
two
boys
sleeping
at
the
time
in
the
shed
so
as
to
guard
their
flying
machine
if
one
watchman
ai
enough
i
get
three
half
a
dozen
if
necessary
declared
colonel
josiah
as
he
glared
at
the
offending
shea
and
pounded
on
the
turf
with
his
heavy
cane
but
these
lads
are
going
to
be
protected
if
it
takes
my
last
dollar
i
get
a
gatling
gun
and
train
it
here
so
we
can
blow
the
rascals
to
smithereens
if
they
try
such
a
dastardly
job
again
but
everybody
knew
that
the
genial
old
colonel
did
considerable
talking
and
blustering
but
was
harmless
withal
shea
promised
to
remain
awake
the
balance
of
the
night
he
even
went
to
the
house
and
armed
himself
with
a
big
horse
pistol
that
the
colonel
owned
and
which
had
many
a
story
connected
with
its
keeping
company
with
the
traveler
in
foreign
lands
huh
i
got
half
a
notion
to
camp
right
here
again
like
we
did
that
other
time
frank
said
andy
before
they
locked
the
wide
doors
of
the
shed
here
my
cot
and
blankets
you
see
just
as
i
left
no
need
of
that
andy
returned
his
chum
smiling
after
all
this
rumpus
you
could
hire
that
fellow
to
come
back
here
tonight
he
may
be
ten
miles
away
by
now
wonder
if
that
the
last
i
see
of
my
wheel
now
continued
andy
if
you
addressing
that
to
me
i
like
to
prophesy
that
you
find
the
bike
somewhere
off
the
road
a
mile
or
two
away
where
the
fellow
pitched
it
when
he
concluded
to
make
a
sneak
to
town
there
you
go
barking
up
that
same
tree
again
i
never
saw
such
a
positive
fellow
as
you
are
declared
the
other
smiling
your
name
ought
to
be
thomas
for
you
seem
to
doubt
everything
that
you
ca
just
understand
well
if
not
puss
who
then
demanded
andy
aggressively
i
confess
that
i
do
know
at
this
minute
admitted
frank
but
i
hope
to
discover
the
truth
in
some
way
remember
how
that
other
time
when
some
one
tried
to
injure
us
by
sneaking
in
here
and
cutting
the
canvas
wings
of
our
monoplane
all
to
flinders
i
picked
up
a
playing
card
and
we
afterwards
traced
it
to
the
owner
yes
cried
the
other
instantly
and
was
that
party
puss
carberry
all
right
it
sure
was
laughed
frank
but
forget
this
thing
for
now
perhaps
tomorrow
we
may
be
able
to
find
some
clue
that
will
tell
which
way
the
wind
blows
it
might
be
the
print
of
a
shoe
in
the
earth
or
something
like
that
lots
of
ways
to
pick
up
information
if
only
you
keep
your
wits
at
work
yes
returned
andy
and
if
it
frank
bird
who
doing
the
thinking
but
perhaps
it
would
be
silly
in
me
sleeping
out
here
tonight
i
better
be
traipsing
back
to
bed
right
now
because
you
see
only
half
dressed
and
it
chilly
good
i
see
you
to
the
house
because
i
got
to
walk
home
now
that
my
wheel
has
gone
up
the
flume
remarked
frank
what
the
matter
with
you
using
mine
demanded
the
other
that
plug
you
put
in
holds
dandy
and
there
nothing
the
matter
with
it
right
now
same
old
place
under
the
side
porch
here
guess
the
lamp
is
on
the
bum
but
you
hardly
need
that
if
a
cop
holds
you
up
explain
what
happened
all
right
i
guess
i
might
as
well
ride
as
walk
but
i
hope
i
get
my
wheel
back
it
nearly
new
you
know
and
cost
a
heap
frank
remarked
as
he
dove
under
the
stoop
to
presently
appear
dragging
the
other
bicycle
apply
to
puss
and
company
for
further
information
called
andy
holding
the
door
open
a
crack
to
shoot
the
words
out
and
then
closing
it
frank
laughing
at
the
obstinate
ways
of
his
chum
pushed
the
machine
out
to
the
road
and
was
soon
moving
along
evidently
he
lacked
the
same
confidence
in
andy
wheel
that
he
felt
in
his
own
for
he
made
no
attempt
to
speed
as
he
went
toward
town
and
home
fortunately
he
met
no
policeman
who
might
ask
impertinent
questions
as
to
just
why
he
was
riding
after
dark
without
a
light
and
reaching
home
he
found
his
father
sitting
up
in
his
office
waiting
to
hear
his
report
bird
was
quite
satisfied
with
what
frank
had
to
say
in
regard
to
the
condition
of
the
sick
girl
he
knew
that
the
boy
was
well
up
in
medicine
even
though
he
had
never
tried
to
push
him
in
the
least
frank
gave
evidence
of
being
what
is
known
as
a
natural
born
doctor
keenly
alive
to
everything
pertaining
to
surgery
more
than
once
he
had
set
broken
limbs
for
dogs
and
cats
and
done
it
in
a
manner
that
aroused
the
warmest
praise
from
his
father
who
deep
down
in
his
heart
knew
the
boy
had
it
in
him
to
become
a
famous
surgeon
if
he
kept
along
in
this
path
when
he
came
to
take
up
his
life
pursuit
frank
believed
he
ought
to
tell
about
the
dastardly
attempt
to
destroy
the
monoplane
and
of
course
the
good
doctor
who
always
thought
the
best
of
people
was
horrified
to
hear
his
story
he
shook
his
head
sadly
after
frank
had
finished
i
do
know
what
people
are
coming
to
nowadays
he
remarked
no
matter
who
did
that
mean
act
it
was
wicked
man
or
boy
he
ought
to
be
severely
punished
for
it
the
rights
of
property
seems
to
be
getting
less
respect
every
year
it
puzzles
me
to
lay
the
blame
for
this
spirit
at
the
right
door
but
things
were
not
so
in
my
young
days
frank
we
live
in
fast
times
my
boy
fast
times
frank
thought
so
himself
as
he
went
off
to
his
room
imagine
his
father
some
forty
years
ago
ever
dreaming
of
building
an
and
speeding
through
the
upper
currents
perhaps
thousands
of
feet
above
the
earth
at
the
rate
of
a
mile
a
minute
and
yet
that
was
what
he
and
andy
had
been
doing
thinking
nothing
of
the
feat
as
they
became
accustomed
to
its
performance
fast
times
indeed
frank
did
not
allow
the
startling
incidents
of
the
night
to
keep
him
awake
he
knew
just
how
to
get
a
grip
on
himself
and
put
all
these
things
out
of
his
mind
once
his
head
touched
the
pillow
time
enough
in
the
morning
to
begin
worrying
about
that
lost
wheel
and
trying
to
figure
out
who
the
firebug
could
have
been
at
breakfast
frank
had
to
go
over
the
whole
story
again
for
the
benefit
of
janet
who
had
heard
enough
about
it
from
the
doctor
before
her
brother
came
down
to
whet
her
appetite
for
more
frank
could
see
that
she
shared
the
suspicions
entertained
by
andy
janet
knew
puss
carberry
of
old
and
despised
him
most
heartily
at
one
time
he
had
taken
a
great
liking
to
frank
pretty
sister
but
when
she
learned
what
his
nature
was
janet
had
cut
him
dead
on
the
street
and
from
that
day
on
she
had
believed
puss
capable
of
almost
anything
even
after
you
saved
his
life
yesterday
too
she
exclaimed
indignantly
hold
on
there
sis
cried
frank
laughing
you
as
bad
as
andy
who
is
ready
to
condemn
on
general
principles
we
have
got
a
scrap
of
evidence
to
prove
puss
guilty
just
as
like
as
not
he
would
show
an
if
we
accused
him
of
it
and
prove
that
he
was
at
home
all
evening
so
please
do
mention
his
name
to
anybody
or
i
may
get
in
a
scrape
but
you
going
to
find
out
are
you
demanded
janet
i
surely
hope
to
and
recover
my
poor
bike
in
the
bargain
luckily
got
my
name
and
address
scratched
on
the
underpart
of
the
frame
if
the
finder
only
takes
the
trouble
to
look
and
now
i
off
downtown
to
speak
to
chief
waller
about
it
ten
minutes
later
frank
dropped
off
in
front
of
police
headquarters
and
no
sooner
had
he
alighted
than
the
lad
discovered
that
there
was
a
buzz
of
excitement
about
the
place
for
several
men
were
conferring
and
the
chief
himself
seemed
disturbed
he
looked
eagerly
at
frank
as
the
boy
came
forward
and
started
to
relate
what
had
occurred
on
the
preceding
night
out
near
the
residence
of
colonel
josiah
whympers
immediately
the
face
of
the
chief
began
to
light
up
and
an
eager
glow
shine
in
his
eyes
it
seemed
as
though
what
frank
was
telling
must
have
given
him
a
connecting
link
that
he
had
found
himself
badly
in
need
of
now
we
know
where
he
went
he
exclaimed
calling
to
one
of
his
men
go
out
to
colonel
josiah
whympers
green
and
see
what
traces
you
can
get
of
him
then
once
more
turning
to
the
astonished
boy
he
went
on
you
see
we
had
a
jail
delivery
here
last
night
a
desperate
scoundrel
managed
to
slip
away
undetected
and
we
only
found
it
out
this
morning
and
the
man
who
got
out
was
your
old
friend
jules
garrone
the
french
aviator
who
was
caught
by
the
help
of
the
bird
boys
and
their
bully
little
aeroplane
get
that
frank
chapter
vii
andy
receives
a
shock
then
it
was
jules
who
set
fire
to
our
shed
exclaimed
the
boy
astounded
none
other
you
may
be
sure
replied
chief
waller
nodding
his
head
and
made
off
on
my
wheel
continued
frank
beginning
to
grasp
the
truth
that
just
what
he
did
went
on
the
official
found
he
steal
your
aeroplane
and
was
bound
to
lay
his
hands
on
something
belonging
to
the
birds
that
would
carry
him
out
of
danger
glad
you
came
frank
i
just
call
up
all
the
surrounding
towns
and
ask
if
a
bicyclist
has
been
seen
there
i
hope
you
can
describe
the
wheel
so
they
might
know
it
yes
i
even
know
the
number
besides
i
got
my
address
scratched
on
the
of
the
frame
but
whatever
do
you
suppose
jules
wanted
to
set
our
hangar
on
fire
for
frank
asked
huh
replied
the
chief
do
know
unless
it
was
a
spirit
of
revenge
some
of
these
french
rascals
have
the
same
nature
as
the
corsican
or
the
sicilian
and
hug
the
idea
of
revenge
to
their
hearts
revenge
frank
cried
but
when
did
we
ever
injure
them
oh
yes
i
forgot
we
chased
them
off
at
the
time
they
tried
to
steal
our
aeroplane
and
they
even
neglected
to
take
those
two
suit
cases
of
jewelry
with
them
so
the
stolen
property
was
recovered
yes
the
chief
went
on
and
that
was
all
either
remember
that
it
was
you
bird
boys
who
discovered
that
they
were
hiding
in
the
old
shack
deep
in
the
forest
you
saw
them
near
there
when
you
were
sailing
over
that
region
in
your
airship
and
reported
to
me
and
so
we
surrounded
the
cabin
and
nabbed
our
game
it
may
be
they
learned
who
gave
them
away
and
jules
on
finding
himself
at
large
made
up
his
mind
to
get
even
before
running
off
turning
to
the
phone
on
his
desk
the
chief
now
started
to
call
up
several
of
the
neighboring
towns
some
were
only
six
or
eight
miles
away
while
others
might
be
double
that
and
more
frank
knew
where
the
road
ran
that
passed
the
whympers
place
and
when
finally
the
police
head
got
shelby
he
pricked
up
his
ears
immediately
he
saw
chief
waller
show
signs
of
sudden
interest
a
smile
crept
over
his
face
as
though
he
were
hearing
news
that
pleased
him
then
he
engaged
in
a
hurried
conversation
with
the
police
official
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
after
which
he
turned
to
frank
i
think
i
located
your
wheel
frank
he
observed
over
at
shelby
you
mean
queried
the
other
the
chief
nodded
in
the
affirmative
yes
over
at
shelby
he
said
it
seems
that
early
this
morning
a
wagon
belonging
to
a
countryman
coming
in
to
market
was
stopped
by
something
lying
on
the
road
getting
down
the
farmer
found
that
it
was
a
man
badly
injured
as
if
he
had
taken
a
header
from
a
wheel
and
indeed
a
bicycle
was
found
close
by
with
some
parts
of
it
damaged
as
if
it
had
been
run
at
full
speed
against
a
rock
sending
the
rider
ten
feet
away
where
he
landed
on
his
head
and
was
knocked
out
was
it
my
wheel
asked
frank
he
described
it
for
the
farmer
brought
both
man
and
wheel
to
police
headquarters
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
it
yours
and
the
unfortunate
rider
answers
to
jules
now
i
going
to
get
an
automobile
at
the
garage
and
go
over
if
you
want
to
go
along
i
be
glad
to
have
you
frank
i
certainly
would
replied
the
boy
quickly
i
hope
the
poor
fellow
did
go
so
far
as
to
break
his
neck
but
let
me
go
after
a
machine
for
you
chief
i
got
an
errand
at
the
garage
anyhow
as
my
dad
wants
a
mechanic
sent
up
to
potter
at
his
little
runabout
out
of
commission
as
usual
he
ordered
a
better
car
you
know
and
is
only
waiting
for
it
to
be
delivered
shall
i
go
yes
tuttle
will
know
which
machine
i
generally
use
when
on
official
business
for
you
see
the
town
pays
the
bill
be
back
as
soon
as
you
can
frank
yes
sir
replied
the
other
hastening
away
the
mystery
was
now
solved
and
after
all
puss
had
been
proven
innocent
on
this
last
count
frank
laughed
to
think
how
amazed
andy
would
likely
be
when
he
heard
the
news
i
only
hope
he
does
happen
to
run
across
puss
before
i
get
a
chance
to
open
his
eyes
he
was
saying
to
himself
as
he
headed
for
the
nearby
garage
because
i
really
believe
andy
is
mad
enough
to
challenge
our
old
enemy
and
throw
the
accusation
in
his
teeth
then
there
would
be
a
high
old
with
puss
in
the
right
for
once
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
deliver
both
messages
he
saw
a
mechanic
start
off
to
tackle
the
disabled
runabout
for
the
doctor
so
he
could
carry
out
his
round
of
morning
visits
by
ten
and
then
a
chauffeur
ran
a
car
out
of
the
garage
into
which
he
invited
frank
to
jump
when
they
arrived
at
police
headquarters
the
chief
was
awaiting
them
evidently
he
was
not
at
all
averse
to
this
delightful
spin
across
country
on
a
fine
july
morning
and
with
nothing
to
pay
official
business
might
sometimes
prove
worth
cultivating
presently
they
were
off
frank
of
course
knew
every
rod
of
the
way
he
had
more
than
a
few
times
made
the
trip
over
to
shelby
on
his
wheel
in
company
with
andy
and
since
they
had
taken
to
the
air
they
had
looked
down
upon
that
road
for
miles
as
they
whirled
along
hundreds
of
feet
up
discovering
features
about
the
landscape
that
they
had
never
dreamed
of
before
they
had
this
view
as
andy
delighted
to
call
it
playing
upon
their
own
name
in
due
time
they
reached
shelby
and
drew
up
in
front
of
the
building
where
the
police
held
forth
the
first
one
to
meet
their
eyes
as
they
entered
was
a
familiar
figure
seated
in
a
chair
and
attended
by
a
doctor
and
a
couple
of
officers
it
jules
sure
enough
said
frank
as
despite
the
many
bandages
about
the
head
of
the
man
he
recognized
the
dapper
little
french
aviator
with
whom
he
had
had
more
or
less
trouble
in
the
past
and
jules
grinned
as
he
saw
them
his
spirit
was
not
crushed
even
though
it
began
to
look
as
though
he
might
be
the
football
of
fate
it
ees
ze
fortunes
of
war
messiers
he
said
wincing
at
the
pain
speech
caused
him
and
after
all
it
was
ze
machine
of
ze
young
inventor
zat
downed
me
i
am
von
lucky
man
not
to
haf
been
five
thousand
feet
up
in
ze
air
when
it

had
eet
been

zat
kicked
me
pouf
poor
jules
he
would
haf
been
as
flat
as
ze
pancake
as
eet
is
after
i
haf
serve
my
time
i
am
yet
alive
frank
found
his
bicycle
badly
damaged
in
fact
the
front
wheel
was
smashed
beyond
recovery
for
it
had
been
driven
against
some
stone
at
a
tremendous
pace
strange
to
say
the
lamp
had
gone
through
it
all
without
any
apparent
damage
a
few
dollars
will
fix
it
up
all
right
he
said
cheerfully
and
i
guess
i
ought
to
be
thankful
ever
to
see
it
again
so
he
placed
the
wheel
in
the
back
of
the
big
touring
car
the
doctor
announced
that
jules
might
be
moved
without
danger
if
they
were
careful
and
this
chief
waller
promised
he
would
be
you
giving
us
a
heap
of
bother
jules
he
said
after
the
captured
rascal
had
been
safety
stowed
away
in
the
tonneau
of
the
car
with
the
chief
beside
him
and
frank
mounting
to
the
front
with
the
chauffeur
but
this
winds
you
up
i
understand
your
trial
comes
off
tomorrow
and
you
soon
be
snug
in
the
pen
zat
was
ze
knowledge
zat
urge
me
to
break
out
remarked
the
prisoner
blandly
well
remarked
the
other
with
a
tightening
of
his
lips
we
make
sure
you
do
get
another
opportunity
that
all
frank
watched
as
they
drew
near
the
place
of
colonel
josiah
he
anticipated
that
the
prisoner
would
be
eager
to
look
across
the
field
to
where
the
shed
stood
nor
was
frank
surprised
to
hear
him
give
a
low
cry
eet
is
wonderful
ze
luck
zey
haf
jules
remarked
as
he
discovered
that
the
hangar
had
not
burned
to
the
ground
as
he
expected
and
after
that
he
relapsed
into
gloomy
silence
frank
had
caught
sight
of
andy
passing
along
the
street
ahead
and
entering
the
bloomsbury
postoffice
so
as
soon
as
he
could
get
his
broken
wheel
into
the
bicycle
store
where
he
left
orders
for
its
being
fixed
at
once
he
hurried
off
in
hopes
of
intercepting
his
cousin
and
breaking
the
great
news
he
was
just
in
time
to
see
andy
coming
out
of
the
building
and
staring
hard
at
something
he
held
in
his
hand
frank
could
see
that
it
was
a
letter
and
he
also
noticed
that
his
chum
was
unusually
pale
now
i
wonder
what
he
got
asked
frank
talking
to
himself
as
many
boys
often
do
at
times
looks
like
a
letter
too
once
in
a
while
the
colonel
asks
him
to
go
down
when
the
mail
comes
in
and
see
if
there
is
an
important
one
for
him
which
he
ca
wait
for
the
carrier
to
bring
out
and
andy
has
got
one
this
time
sure
a
moment
later
and
he
came
upon
andy
who
at
sight
of
his
chum
showed
signs
of
relief
i
awful
glad
you
came
along
frank
he
said
seizing
the
other
by
the
sleeve
i
was
at
your
house
and
they
told
me
you
had
gone
downtown
somewhere
then
as
the
mail
was
in
i
remembered
colonel
josiah
was
expecting
one
of
his
letters
from
london
and
so
i
dropped
over
but
there
was
nothing
for
him
guthrie
handed
me
out
this
and
said
he
guessed
it
was
for
me
oh
look
where
it
is
from
frank
do
you
think
can
it
be
possible
that
it
means
some
news
after
all
this
time
from
my
father
frank
saw
it
was
rather
a
bulky
letter
and
that
the
postmark
showed
a
station
in
south
america
remembering
all
that
had
passed
between
them
in
connection
with
this
country
he
understood
the
cause
of
andy
great
emotion
i
was
almost
afraid
to
open
it
frank
said
the
other
brokenly
well
do
it
now
remarked
frank
and
andy
tore
the
end
off
hurriedly
he
appeared
to
read
hungrily
for
a
minute
and
then
gave
a
cry
of
amazement
oh
he
said
taking
in
a
big
breath
how
strange
how
wonderful
chapter
viii
the
message
frank
bird
could
restrain
his
curiosity
no
longer
what
is
it
andy
he
asked
as
he
laid
an
affectionate
arm
across
the
shoulders
of
his
cousin
the
other
turned
his
eyes
upon
frank
and
there
was
something
in
their
depths
that
stirred
the
other
tremendously
is
it
about
your
father
andy
he
demanded
eagerness
plainly
showing
in
his
whole
manner
for
he
understood
what
a
hold
the
subject
had
on
his
chum
andy
nodded
and
as
soon
as
he
could
command
his
quivering
voice
said
yes
nothing
more
than
a
letter
from
the
grave
i
fear
see
frank
written
in
his
own
dear
hand
oh
to
think
of
it
that
at
least
three
months
ago
he
was
alive
even
though
a
prisoner
the
sport
of
fate
a
prisoner
echoed
frank
astonished
whatever
can
you
mean
did
he
fall
into
the
hands
of
some
of
those
strange
indians
we
have
been
reading
about
who
have
their
homes
around
the
headwaters
of
the
orinoco
river
in
venezuela
this
time
andy
shook
his
head
in
the
negative
it
is
stranger
than
that
almost
beyond
belief
he
replied
my
poor
father
has
for
months
been
imprisoned
in
a
great
valley
surrounded
by
impassable
cliffs
do
you
remember
something
of
the
sort
occurred
in
one
of
captain
mayne
reid
books
where
the
young
plant
hunters
found
themselves
prisoners
in
that
way
but
here
frank
look
for
yourself
where
does
the
letter
come
from
in
the
beginning
asked
the
other
quietly
wishing
to
advance
by
slow
degrees
so
that
he
could
understand
everything
a
town
in
columbia
called
barranquila
replied
andy
readily
enough
i
not
sure
but
i
think
it
lies
at
the
mouth
of
the
big
magdalena
river
and
is
upon
the
coast
you
know
i
just
devoured
the
map
of
that
region
for
months
and
every
name
is
familiar
to
me
besides
this
queer
communication
which
you
say
is
from
your
father
frank
went
on
there
seems
to
be
another
letter
that
is
from
señor
josé
almirez
read
it
frank
and
you
will
begin
to
understand
the
letter
was
in
a
crabbed
hand
apparently
unused
to
writing
in
english
though
grammatically
correct
and
this
was
what
frank
saw
to
señor
andrew
bird
i
received
the
enclosed
from
a
correspondent
and
customer
one
carlos
mendoza
located
in
the
vicinity
of
manangue
a
town
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
he
is
a
grower
of
cocoa
in
the
rich
valley
i
do
not
enclose
his
letter
because
it
is
written
in
spanish
but
it
simply
says
that
he
found
the
written
communication
close
to
his
plantation
house
one
morning
in
april
of
this
year
at
first
he
could
not
understand
how
it
came
there
then
upon
having
the
writing
translated
he
noticed
that
the
missive
was
attached
to
what
seemed
to
be
a
little
parachute
or
balloon
made
up
of
a
fragment
of
silk
belonging
to
a
balloon
knowing
that
i
had
spent
several
years
in
washington
in
the
service
of
my
country
he
finally
concluded
to
send
the
same
to
me
i
have
the
honor
to
transmit
it
to
the
address
given
in
the
communication
with
respect
and
expressing
a
willingness
to
help
you
all
i
may
señor
andrew
bird
believe
me
to
be
most
sincerely
yours
josé
costilena
almirez
frank
read
this
amazing
communication
and
then
turned
to
stare
at
his
cousin
no
do
stop
yet
exclaimed
the
trembling
andy
read
the
other
the
missive
that
carlos
mendoza
picked
up
on
his
cocoa
plantation
in
the
valley
of
the
magdalena
river
and
so
frank
again
turned
his
attention
to
the
enclosure
that
had
been
sent
on
by
the
friendly
merchant
of
columbia
it
seemed
to
be
a
sheet
of
thin
but
pliable
bark
from
a
tree
and
in
some
respects
reminded
frank
of
birch
bark
which
he
had
often
used
in
lieu
of
paper
when
in
the
woods
the
juice
of
some
berry
had
afforded
ink
and
doubtless
the
college
professor
had
easily
made
a
pen
from
a
bird
quill
and
this
was
what
frank
read
a
small
portion
of
the
communication
being
missing
as
though
it
had
received
rough
usage
somewhere
en
route
whoever
finds
this
i
pray
that
it
be
forwarded
to
andrew
bird
in
the
town
of
bloomsbury
state
of
new
york
a
in
my
balloon
i
was
carried
away
by
a
sudden
storm
while
crossing
the
isthmus
of
panama
as
near
as
i
can
calculate
i
was
swept
some
three
hundred
miles
more
or
less
in
a
direction
much
of
the
time
above
the
clouds
then
something
happened
and
i
felt
myself
falling
giving
myself
up
for
lost
i
awoke
from
a
swoon
to
find
myself
in
the
branches
of
a
tree
with
the
wreck
of
the
balloon
near
me
a
merciful
providence
has
saved
my
life
but
i
fear
only
to
prolong
my
agony
of
soul
for
months
now
i
have
been
a
prisoner
in
a
remarkable
valley
a
enclosed
by
inaccessible
cliffs
many
times
have
i
struggled
to
climb
to
their
top
but
only
to
meet
defeat
all
this
time
i
have
sustained
life
by
means
of
fruits
that
grow
in
abundance
in
this
tropical
valley
in
the
hope
that
i
may
manage
to
communicate
my
horrible
condition
to
the
outside
world
i
have
made
scores
of
small
parachutes
and
when
the
breeze
at
the
top
of
the
cliffs
appeared
favorable
send
them
up
by
means
of
hot
air
each
carrying
a
message
to
my
son
god
in
his
infinite
wisdom
only
knows
if
one
of
these
will
ever
reach
him
i
shall
continue
to
have
hope
and
sustain
life
as
long
as
my
mind
remains
professor
philip
b
when
he
had
finished
this
astonishing
document
frank
turned
to
his
chum
oh
what
a
remarkable
thing
i
never
heard
its
equal
in
all
my
life
to
think
that
your
father
has
been
alive
all
these
months
though
a
prisoner
in
that
valley
but
andy
do
you
see
that
now
nothing
is
going
to
keep
us
from
going
down
there
and
finding
him
here
is
the
clue
you
wanted
only
instead
of
discovering
his
sad
fate
you
are
going
to
rescue
him
and
bring
him
home
again
they
reached
out
and
gripped
hands
there
was
something
in
that
act
to
stamp
the
more
than
brotherly
feeling
existing
between
them
do
you
think
we
could
do
it
frank
exclaimed
andy
more
than
ever
willing
that
his
chum
should
take
the
lead
in
this
most
eventful
moment
of
his
whole
young
life
sure
i
do
answered
the
comforter
readily
did
we
conquer
one
battery
of
cliffs
that
were
said
to
be
insurmountable
when
we
sailed
in
our
dandy
little
monoplane
up
to
the
crown
of
old
thunder
top
and
snatched
that
silver
cup
for
a
prize
make
up
your
mind
my
boy
that
that
was
just
meant
to
get
us
in
practice
for
better
things
the
come
for
us
to
show
what
we
made
of
and
instead
of
a
silver
cup
the
prize
this
time
will
be
my
father
life
murmured
andy
tears
in
his
eyes
as
he
again
squeezed
that
faithful
hand
which
held
his
so
firmly
that
right
frank
continued
we
can
go
straight
to
this
fine
spanish
gentleman
señor
almirez
and
get
all
the
points
he
knows
from
there
we
get
to
this
valley
town
and
visit
carlos
mendozo
on
his
cocoa
plantation
depend
on
it
he
be
able
to
set
us
on
the
track
somehow
or
other
oh
it
seems
like
a
strange
dream
said
andy
as
he
raised
the
piece
of
bark
to
his
young
lips
and
passionately
kissed
it
regardless
of
the
fact
that
some
one
passing
the
post
office
might
notice
him
well
you
want
to
wake
up
right
away
then
remarked
frank
smiling
because
we
just
got
to
get
a
hustle
on
us
if
we
going
to
start
on
this
wonderful
trip
here
where
our
aeroplane
is
going
to
help
us
out
just
imagine
how
we
can
pass
over
regions
where
it
would
be
next
to
impossible
for
us
to
navigate
on
foot
mountainous
country
tropical
valleys
where
wild
beasts
roam
and
poisonous
snakes
abound
and
jungles
where
the
natives
have
to
cut
a
passage
foot
by
foot
i
understand
with
their
and
to
think
that
we
can
sail
freely
over
it
all
looking
for
that
spot
where
that
bark
letter
came
from
come
let
go
home
exclaimed
andy
i
sure
colonel
josiah
will
be
tremendously
interested
in
what
we
learned
he
be
the
most
disappointed
man
in
the
whole
just
because
he
so
crippled
that
he
ca
go
along
for
many
years
he
traveled
in
every
country
under
the
sun
perhaps
he
might
tell
us
more
about
the
interior
of
colombia
than
we
know
right
now
accordingly
they
hurried
away
frank
came
near
forgetting
the
news
he
had
been
bearing
at
the
time
he
met
his
cousin
but
then
that
was
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
the
capture
of
the
escaped
robber
was
of
minor
importance
when
compared
with
this
wonderful
business
connected
with
professor
bird
and
just
as
andy
had
said
colonel
josiah
tremendously
interested
when
he
heard
about
it
and
with
his
own
eyes
looked
upon
the
letter
that
had
come
from
a
living
tomb
somebody
pinch
me
he
said
looking
at
the
boys
almost
helplessly
i
surely
must
be
asleep
and
dreaming
this
it
seems
too
strange
to
be
true
philip
alive
all
these
months
and
in
that
terrible
situation
while
we
were
enjoying
the
good
things
of
the
world
up
here
it
is
monstrous
you
must
go
down
there
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
andrew
who
knows
but
what
it
may
be
your
blessed
good
fortune
to
rescue
your
dear
father
and
bring
him
back
with
you
money
all
you
need
and
the
prayers
of
an
old
man
go
with
you
but
think
said
andy
uneasily
this
was
written
three
months
ago
what
may
not
have
happened
in
all
that
time
there
must
be
beasts
in
that
sunken
valley
and
doubtless
many
poisonous
reptiles
perhaps
hold
on
cried
frank
interrupting
him
do
you
go
to
imagining
all
sorts
of
terrible
things
he
had
been
there
at
least
nine
months
already
nothing
had
happened
to
injure
him
he
does
not
even
hint
at
such
a
thing
but
says
he
means
to
sustain
his
life
as
long
as
he
retains
his
proper
mind
your
father
was
not
in
the
least
like
you
andy
he
possessed
a
wonderfully
mind
and
laid
out
his
plans
with
deliberation
believe
me
the
chances
are
ten
to
one
he
is
still
there
and
waiting
we
are
going
to
find
him
do
allow
any
other
idea
to
take
possession
of
your
head
find
him
do
you
hear
of
course
that
sort
of
talk
had
its
effect
on
andy
and
he
braced
up
they
began
to
make
preparations
and
plans
without
delay
the
monoplane
was
taken
apart
and
carefully
crated
then
frank
ran
down
to
the
city
and
returned
with
several
duplicate
parts
secured
at
an
aeroplane
agency
he
knew
of
and
which
would
come
in
handy
in
case
of
an
accident
in
that
strange
country
where
they
must
depend
entirely
on
themselves
for
two
days
there
was
a
tremendous
lot
of
bustle
around
both
homes
bird
had
no
longer
any
valid
excuse
for
refusing
frank
permission
to
go
since
it
was
a
mission
of
mercy
that
beckoned
the
boys
on
to
that
south
american
mountainous
region
besides
he
had
always
been
very
fond
of
his
elder
brother
who
had
done
so
much
to
make
the
name
of
bird
famous
in
college
and
out
even
though
the
professor
had
thought
best
to
make
his
old
friend
colonel
josiah
his
boy
guardian
instead
of
the
physician
the
aeroplane
had
been
shipped
to
new
york
to
be
put
upon
a
steamer
sailing
for
maracaibo
in
venezuela
and
which
they
expected
to
take
also
from
this
port
they
would
have
to
make
their
way
to
the
mouth
of
the
magdalena
river
by
means
of
some
smaller
craft
but
with
virtually
unlimited
means
to
back
them
the
boys
did
not
fear
but
that
they
could
overcome
any
difficulties
that
might
arise
in
their
path
indeed
frank
had
a
disposition
that
would
never
allow
anything
to
balk
his
plans
if
it
were
at
all
within
the
power
of
human
nature
to
accomplish
results
the
last
thing
they
heard
just
before
leaving
bloomsbury
was
that
puss
carberry
and
his
crony
sandy
hollingshead
had
gone
away
taking
their
biplane
along
and
it
was
said
that
they
expected
to
do
wonderful
stunts
with
their
airship
somewhere
in
the
south
but
our
two
boys
were
too
deeply
interested
in
their
own
fortunes
to
give
more
than
a
passing
thought
to
the
flitting
of
their
rivals
besides
it
would
not
seem
that
there
could
be
one
chance
in
a
thousand
that
they
would
ever
run
across
puss
and
sandy
in
all
that
great
country
lying
south
of
the
caribbean
sea
and
north
of
the
mighty
amazon
and
one
morning
frank
and
andy
said
goodbye
to
those
whose
best
wishes
were
wafted
after
them
taking
train
to
new
york
city
so
as
to
go
aboard
the
steamer
that
was
scheduled
to
sail
that
chapter
ix
under
troubled
skies
oh
how
glad
i
am
to
think
we
arrived
at
last
andy
uttered
these
words
as
he
stood
at
the
rail
of
a
small
but
staunch
steam
yacht
of
rather
ancient
vintage
that
he
and
frank
had
leased
when
arriving
at
maracaibo
the
city
on
the
bay
of
the
same
name
from
whence
so
much
of
venezuela
coffee
is
shipped
to
the
states
it
had
belonged
to
some
englishman
who
becoming
stranded
at
this
south
american
port
while
on
a
globe
circling
trip
was
forced
to
let
it
go
and
the
agents
gladly
secured
a
crew
for
the
adventurous
young
americans
who
were
bound
up
the
magdalena
river
for
some
unknown
purpose
yes
observed
frank
who
leaned
on
the
same
rail
close
beside
him
there
the
town
of
barranquila
all
right
we
navigated
the
five
hundred
miles
in
this
little
steam
craft
with
only
a
few
of
the
machinery
and
just
two
days
delay
and
the
second
step
on
our
journey
comes
to
a
close
the
third
ought
to
take
us
to
that
valley
town
up
the
river
ai
i
right
asked
the
anxious
andy
sure
as
near
as
i
can
make
it
magangue
must
be
not
over
two
hundred
miles
upstream
with
good
luck
we
can
cover
that
in
a
couple
of
days
returned
frank
but
why
do
you
say
good
luck
demanded
his
cousin
suspiciously
oh
well
we
are
now
in
the
land
of
tomorrow
you
remember
laughed
frank
you
mean
where
they
put
off
everything
they
can
saying
hurry
plenty
of
time
señors
all
the
world
was
not
made
in
a
day
is
that
it
andy
went
on
partly
i
was
also
thinking
of
another
thing
admitted
frank
yes
and
i
bet
i
can
give
a
mighty
good
guess
what
it
is
old
fellow
perhaps
you
can
frank
said
a
little
gravely
suppose
you
spout
it
out
you
been
pondering
on
what
old
quito
was
telling
us
in
his
broken
english
about
this
little
revolution
that
has
been
slumbering
around
the
region
of
the
magdalena
river
of
late
you
have
a
hunch
that
we
may
just
be
unlucky
enough
to
run
across
some
of
those
ragged
chaps
who
want
to
upset
the
present
government
of
colombia
and
seat
some
old
fossil
in
the
chair
again
anyhow
you
a
fine
guesser
andy
admitted
frank
then
that
what
was
on
your
mind
asked
the
other
i
noticed
you
frown
a
whole
lot
lately
which
is
unusual
for
my
cheery
pard
frank
oh
well
observed
frank
calmly
i
acknowledge
the
corn
i
was
wondering
whether
we
might
be
troubled
by
any
of
those
fellows
while
we
were
navigating
this
river
i
hope
they
just
let
us
severely
alone
but
you
know
andy
just
as
colonel
josiah
warned
us
these
colombians
do
have
any
too
much
love
for
yankees
ever
since
that
panama
rebellion
when
as
they
believe
our
government
openly
assisted
the
people
of
the
isthmus
throw
off
the
colombian
yoke
because
we
just
had
to
control
that
strip
of
territory
for
the
canal
but
why
should
the
revolutionists
want
to
stop
us
insisted
his
cousin
we
are
here
only
on
a
private
quest
we
seek
no
gold
mines
or
cocoa
plantations
our
only
object
is
a
mission
of
mercy
and
besides
if
these
men
are
in
open
rebellion
they
ought
to
be
glad
to
see
anybody
that
their
government
detests
yankees
or
not
well
pursued
frank
with
a
cautious
glance
around
i
was
thinking
that
some
of
the
people
in
maracaibo
took
altogether
too
much
interest
in
our
little
monoplane
a
lot
of
men
hovered
around
and
asked
many
questions
they
have
heard
and
read
much
about
the
wonderful
things
being
done
today
in
aeronautics
but
have
seen
little
or
nothing
frank
that
so
exclaimed
andy
quickly
please
go
on
you
are
gripping
my
attention
a
heap
i
admit
tell
me
do
you
suspect
that
some
of
those
same
chaps
may
have
been
colombians
i
dead
sure
of
it
and
more
than
that
old
quito
gave
me
to
understand
he
believed
they
were
connected
with
the
junta
that
was
pushing
this
new
revolution
in
colombia
yes
andy
said
in
a
way
that
plainly
invited
further
explanation
stop
and
think
frank
continued
suppose
now
they
conceived
the
idea
that
it
would
further
their
forlorn
cause
a
heap
if
they
only
had
such
an
airship
and
could
threaten
to
drop
all
sorts
of
bombs
into
the
camps
of
the
government
troops
good
gracious
i
suppose
that
is
so
i
never
thought
of
that
frank
you
know
how
nervous
and
excitable
these
people
are
do
you
think
they
give
the
government
the
worst
scare
it
ever
had
and
they
make
almost
any
sort
of
terms
of
settlement
frank
demanded
yes
that
true
then
you
imagine
those
fellows
may
have
planned
to
somehow
steal
our
aeroplane
and
that
they
sent
word
ahead
to
their
friends
along
the
magdalena
to
look
out
for
us
was
andy
startling
question
partly
that
but
do
you
see
andy
the
little
monoplane
would
be
utterly
useless
to
them
unless
they
had
some
one
who
knew
how
to
run
it
the
other
gave
utterance
to
a
low
whistle
just
to
indicate
how
his
feelings
had
been
stirred
you
mean
they
might
try
to
capture
in
the
bargain
and
force
us
to
operate
the
aeroplane
but
suppose
we
did
what
would
hinder
our
just
sailing
away
once
we
got
up
in
the
clouds
tell
me
that
frank
oh
well
i
not
looking
that
far
ahead
smiled
the
other
possibly
they
might
only
let
one
of
us
go
up
keeping
the
other
as
a
hostage
or
perhaps
there
might
be
a
fearless
revolutionist
officer
aboard
with
that
one
sworn
to
shoot
at
the
first
sign
of
treachery
but
do
let
us
cross
a
bridge
until
we
come
to
it
that
right
we
do
want
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
any
ragtag
revolutionists
and
we
wo
we
got
our
work
laid
out
for
us
and
nothing
must
stop
us
all
the
same
i
going
to
keep
an
eye
on
that
precious
case
in
which
our
aeroplane
is
boxed
as
well
as
the
engine
and
frank
i
carrying
the
little
colonel
josiah
gave
me
as
a
parting
present
ditto
myself
replied
the
other
in
a
low
tone
as
one
of
the
crew
happened
to
draw
near
while
getting
ready
to
make
a
landing
at
the
wharf
he
told
us
that
down
in
this
country
it
paid
to
be
ready
for
trouble
though
i
keep
hoping
we
not
going
to
have
anything
of
the
sort
it
was
toward
noon
when
they
steamed
up
to
the
town
that
nestled
near
the
mouth
of
the
great
magdalena
river
of
course
it
was
hot
for
the
season
of
the
year
made
that
a
foregone
conclusion
but
both
boys
were
dressed
in
suitable
attire
and
also
wore
pith
helmets
calculated
to
allow
a
current
of
air
fan
the
head
andy
was
shivering
in
a
mixture
between
hope
and
fear
in
this
city
they
would
meet
the
writer
of
that
pleasant
letter
señor
josé
almirez
what
if
he
had
received
further
intelligence
from
the
correspondent
since
the
time
he
had
mailed
that
letter
what
if
some
terrible
news
awaited
the
coming
of
the
daring
young
yankees
who
had
ventured
to
this
faraway
country
bent
on
solving
the
mystery
connected
with
the
long
absence
of
professor
bird
but
as
usual
it
was
frank
who
buoyed
his
spirit
up
there
never
was
a
chum
more
devoted
to
the
interests
of
his
friend
andy
would
long
since
have
succumbed
to
his
fears
but
for
the
cheery
words
of
the
other
it
was
said
to
be
the
rainy
season
in
this
country
that
lay
in
the
tropics
up
on
the
high
mountain
peaks
lay
snow
the
year
around
but
in
the
low
lands
and
along
the
valleys
and
sides
of
the
uplifts
they
could
grow
coffee
cocoa
bananas
pineapples
oranges
and
all
manner
of
similar
products
a
small
crowd
gathered
at
the
wharf
to
see
the
little
steam
yacht
come
in
perhaps
the
former
english
wandering
owner
had
been
here
before
and
some
of
them
even
recognized
the
vessel
scowls
greeted
her
passengers
when
it
was
discovered
that
they
were
not
english
but
americans
frank
and
andy
paid
little
heed
to
these
frowns
they
did
not
mean
to
leave
the
boat
if
so
be
it
were
possible
to
have
señor
almirez
come
aboard
and
for
that
purpose
they
had
written
to
him
ahead
of
time
telling
him
how
they
expected
to
reach
barranquila
about
a
certain
date
several
breakdowns
of
the
engine
had
delayed
them
so
that
they
were
even
now
two
days
behind
time
on
this
account
as
well
as
through
prudence
they
meant
to
stop
here
as
briefly
as
possible
immediately
their
purser
went
ashore
to
make
inquiries
and
purchase
a
lot
of
fruits
that
could
be
taken
on
the
river
voyage
though
for
that
matter
they
might
expect
to
get
anything
they
wanted
at
various
villages
along
the
route
frank
was
looking
the
crowd
over
closely
i
think
i
see
him
andy
he
remarked
presently
you
mean
señor
josé
asked
his
cousin
eagerly
i
been
watching
that
gentleman
who
seems
to
be
pressing
close
in
on
the
flank
of
the
crowd
there
see
he
is
speaking
to
manuel
our
purser
now
asking
him
some
question
he
looks
up
here
at
us
yes
and
waves
his
hand
with
a
smile
that
must
be
señor
josé
all
right
frank
i
going
down
to
meet
him
to
fetch
him
aboard
declared
frank
after
both
boys
had
answered
the
signals
of
the
gentleman
in
the
white
linen
suit
and
who
was
also
wearing
a
panama
straw
hat
three
minutes
later
and
frank
reappeared
having
the
other
in
tow
just
as
both
of
them
had
suspected
it
was
señor
josé
receiving
their
communication
from
maracaibo
he
had
been
on
the
watch
and
he
tells
me
andy
that
there
has
been
no
new
development
since
he
wrote
so
that
fear
of
yours
must
be
set
at
rest
just
depend
on
it
we
in
this
game
to
win
out
and
your
dear
father
is
going
to
be
found
frank
went
on
presently
they
were
deep
in
conversation
the
boys
found
señor
josé
a
very
intelligent
gentleman
indeed
he
had
spent
some
years
in
washington
in
connection
with
the
embassy
of
his
government
so
that
he
not
only
spoke
and
wrote
english
well
but
had
a
high
opinion
of
americans
something
that
the
vast
majority
of
his
failed
to
acquire
being
possibly
fed
on
stories
that
may
have
had
their
inception
in
german
or
english
trade
sources
from
him
frank
extracted
all
the
information
he
could
concerning
the
wonderful
country
lying
between
magangue
and
the
isthmus
of
panama
covering
possibly
some
three
hundred
miles
it
was
little
enough
most
of
it
he
declared
was
a
being
utterly
unknown
land
but
continued
the
obliging
señor
you
will
certainly
be
able
to
learn
more
concerning
this
when
you
see
my
señor
mendoza
for
all
his
life
has
he
lived
there
at
magangue
and
surely
he
must
know
something
of
that
country
to
the
south
we
shall
leave
here
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
observed
frank
i
have
sent
our
purser
manuel
to
comply
with
the
custom
duties
and
secure
us
a
few
supplies
when
he
comes
aboard
again
we
expect
to
start
it
is
just
as
well
remarked
the
other
significantly
and
seeming
to
be
relieved
because
there
is
an
uneasy
feeling
in
barranquila
just
at
present
agents
of
the
revolutionary
junta
have
been
here
they
are
very
active
and
from
secret
sources
i
happen
to
know
that
they
are
aware
of
the
strange
cargo
you
are
bringing
with
you
you
must
mean
our
aeroplane
señor
remarked
frank
quickly
si
señor
bird
the
other
continued
nodding
his
head
it
has
become
known
that
the
two
young
americanos
are
of
the
new
and
wonderful
aeronauts
with
whom
nothing
is
impossible
and
if
you
remained
here
any
length
of
time
i
fear
lest
even
my
government
might
seek
to
find
some
excuse
for
appropriating
your
little
airship
the
talk
is
all
in
that
direction
now
colombia
is
ripe
to
take
a
forward
step
and
have
an
aviation
corps
well
said
frank
under
the
circumstances
we
would
seriously
object
to
having
our
monoplane
confiscated
now
because
upon
it
we
depend
wholly
in
our
search
but
i
thought
you
were
perhaps
about
to
warn
us
to
look
out
for
these
revolutionists
while
passing
up
the
river
it
would
be
wise
señor
observed
the
amiable
colombian
they
have
agents
here
and
i
happen
to
know
that
one
is
even
now
on
the
wharf
observing
possibly
he
seeks
to
communicate
with
some
spy
who
chances
to
be
a
member
of
your
crew
so
you
see
it
must
pay
you
to
be
always
on
your
guard
and
prepared
chapter
nipped
in
the
bud
there
comes
manuel
remarked
andy
after
they
had
been
nearly
an
hour
talking
on
the
deck
of
the
little
power
boat
yes
remarked
his
cousin
who
was
also
on
the
watch
and
trailing
behind
him
i
can
see
several
native
carts
containing
fruits
and
new
supplies
manuel
surely
means
that
we
shall
not
go
hungry
while
on
the
river
then
i
shall
be
going
my
friends
said
señor
josé
i
have
told
you
all
i
know
i
have
warned
you
to
beware
of
the
revolutionists
along
the
river
bank
i
have
even
given
you
a
hint
that
to
delay
longer
in
barranquila
might
endanger
your
enterprise
since
the
government
is
just
now
very
anxious
to
acquire
such
wonderful
modern
agents
of
warfare
as
your
aeroplane
it
only
remains
to
shake
your
hands
both
and
wish
you
every
good
fortune
your
valor
deserves
they
squeezed
the
hand
of
the
fine
old
colombian
gentleman
with
vigor
never
would
andy
forget
how
he
had
spoken
concerning
his
interest
in
the
sacred
duty
that
had
brought
the
son
of
the
missing
aeronaut
to
his
country
frank
had
given
strict
orders
that
none
of
the
crew
should
go
ashore
and
also
that
no
strangers
be
permitted
to
board
the
craft
while
they
lay
there
at
the
old
wooden
wharf
but
said
andy
when
they
were
speaking
about
this
matter
as
preparations
began
to
leave
the
port
that
has
prevented
the
crew
from
holding
an
animated
confab
with
those
ashore
there
has
been
a
constant
jabbering
and
laughing
between
our
fellows
and
those
others
yes
admitted
frank
and
i
seen
several
of
the
crew
talking
mysteriously
with
some
of
those
chaps
i
wish
now
the
señor
had
thought
to
indicate
which
was
the
secret
agent
of
the
revolutionists
he
saw
on
the
dock
but
all
the
same
i
marked
the
two
fellows
i
suspect
and
i
going
to
keep
a
close
eye
on
enrique
and
the
little
fellow
with
the
quick
motions
we
call
because
he
forever
ejaculating
like
that
and
if
you
find
out
that
they
meddling
with
the
boxes
asked
andy
h
i
guess
it
be
a
bad
day
for
enrique
and
the
that
all
laughed
his
cousin
but
there
goes
the
cable
and
it
looks
like
we
might
be
off
at
last
i
not
sorry
for
many
things
declared
andy
with
a
sigh
of
positive
relief
the
good
señor
got
me
scared
by
what
he
said
about
his
government
wanting
just
such
things
as
our
little
and
that
the
officials
might
have
orders
to
find
some
sort
of
ridiculous
excuse
for
grabbing
it
same
here
admitted
frank
in
fact
that
bothered
me
a
whole
lot
more
than
the
chances
of
trouble
along
the
river
from
the
boys
who
want
to
get
their
man
seated
in
the
president
chair
where
he
could
hand
out
the
loaves
and
the
fishes
we
can
resist
them
and
be
backed
by
authority
but
if
the
government
officers
once
took
us
in
we
have
to
give
up
our
job
and
that
would
break
your
heart
andy
yes
said
the
other
drawing
a
long
breath
i
afraid
it
would
listen
there
goes
the
whistle
i
told
the
pilot
not
to
make
more
fuss
than
he
could
help
when
we
drew
out
which
was
quite
right
i
watching
that
little
chap
cospita
see
him
wave
his
hand
to
some
one
ashore
yes
and
that
surely
looked
like
a
signal
the
fellow
returned
we
are
going
to
have
trouble
with
that
boy
yet
andy
well
that
will
be
bad
for
cospita
was
all
the
other
remarked
for
he
was
eagerly
watching
the
growing
space
between
the
boat
and
the
shore
look
frank
he
remarked
after
a
little
time
had
elapsed
as
sure
as
you
live
there
is
an
officer
in
uniform
just
arrived
on
the
dock
and
backed
by
a
squad
of
soldiers
he
seems
to
be
surprised
at
discovering
that
we
have
gone
now
he
beckons
and
waves
his
hat
listen
to
him
shouting
something
in
spanish
through
his
hands
i
guess
we
did
get
away
from
barranquila
five
minutes
too
soon
it
looks
like
it
said
frank
grimly
but
we
complied
with
the
law
of
the
land
and
nothing
short
of
a
cannon
could
make
us
turn
back
now
all
the
same
i
going
to
the
pilot
house
and
keep
an
eye
on
felipe
i
think
he
trustworthy
but
an
ounce
of
prevention
is
better
than
a
pound
of
cure
always
good
for
you
andy
shot
after
his
departing
chum
though
he
himself
remained
there
by
the
rail
watching
what
took
place
ashore
frank
quickly
entered
the
pilot
house
here
a
man
handled
the
wheel
frank
immediately
noticed
that
he
was
listening
to
what
the
gold
braided
officer
ashore
was
shouting
angrily
he
also
looked
a
bit
troubled
what
does
he
say
felipe
demanded
the
young
aviator
he
commands
us
to
return
señor
replied
the
other
well
pay
no
attention
to
him
felipe
we
have
complied
with
all
the
regulations
and
red
tape
necessary
the
american
consul
will
back
us
up
it
is
your
business
to
simply
steer
this
boat
up
the
river
until
we
arrive
at
magangue
si
señor
but
when
i
return
they
will
surely
make
the
trouble
for
me
replied
the
pilot
shrugging
his
narrow
shoulders
not
at
all
felipe
declared
frank
you
can
swear
that
we
made
you
do
as
we
wished
that
you
dared
not
turn
back
since
your
life
was
in
danger
we
stand
ready
to
shoulder
all
the
blame
there
is
the
dusky
face
of
the
old
river
pilot
whom
they
had
fortunately
run
across
in
maracaibo
became
wreathed
in
a
smile
perhaps
the
young
señor
would
not
mind
showing
the
capitan
he
suggested
frank
grasped
his
meaning
and
pretending
to
scowl
darkly
he
drew
out
the
revolver
which
colonel
josiah
had
made
him
promise
to
carry
while
down
in
this
explosive
country
now
felipe
he
said
as
he
clapped
the
weapon
deliberately
against
the
head
of
the
pilot
your
gay
capitan
can
easily
see
what
i
am
doing
and
will
understand
what
it
means
you
keep
right
on
and
if
you
dare
disobey
it
will
be
bad
for
you
felipe
the
shrewd
old
pilot
tried
to
smother
an
expansive
grin
as
he
replied
si
señor
i
am
in
your
hands
do
with
me
what
you
will
i
dare
not
refuse
longer
see
i
have
made
one
effort
to
turn
about
but
you
threaten
and
i
give
it
up
he
no
longer
calls
he
knows
old
felipe
is
powerless
it
is
well
frank
stood
by
him
until
the
wharf
was
dimmed
by
distance
then
he
hastened
to
rejoin
his
cousin
and
chum
who
was
mightily
pleased
to
hear
all
about
it
do
you
think
they
will
chase
after
us
queried
andy
still
worried
oh
i
guess
not
it
is
so
serious
as
all
that
they
know
they
can
get
us
when
we
come
down
the
river
no
doubt
replied
frank
carelessly
then
i
care
precious
little
what
becomes
of
the
bug
observed
andy
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
suppose
you
mean
that
by
that
time
you
either
have
found
your
father
or
else
given
up
the
search
as
hopeless
is
that
it
old
fellow
frank
asked
yes
one
or
the
other
and
now
we
got
time
to
remember
the
other
warning
good
old
señor
josé
gave
us
about
the
revolutionists
trying
to
stop
us
on
the
way
and
get
our
cargo
yes
frank
went
on
that
must
be
on
our
minds
constantly
going
to
talk
with
old
felipe
about
it
soon
i
have
a
hunch
that
he
can
be
depended
on
to
back
us
up
for
he
got
a
grudge
against
the
man
these
fellows
want
to
send
back
into
the
presidential
chair
señor
josé
told
me
felipe
lost
all
his
family
through
the
persecution
of
that
man
and
his
party
a
bully
good
thing
to
know
assented
andy
for
we
can
be
dead
sure
of
felipe
all
the
time
and
through
him
get
pointers
about
the
rest
of
the
crew
there
are
a
few
goats
among
the
sheep
and
when
we
make
sure
of
it
i
just
going
to
pay
them
off
and
chuck
them
ashore
in
any
old
place
now
that
what
i
call
a
clever
scheme
frank
declared
they
would
have
no
kick
coming
because
you
see
no
spanish
american
could
ever
complain
of
getting
his
wages
without
having
to
do
any
work
i
guess
not
andy
remarked
grinning
assent
upon
further
conference
it
was
decided
to
divide
the
day
and
night
into
watches
so
that
one
of
them
could
be
on
deck
and
alert
all
of
the
time
while
the
other
secured
some
sleep
treachery
they
knew
would
be
likely
to
crop
out
during
the
night
time
those
on
board
may
have
found
some
means
of
telling
their
confederates
ashore
about
what
time
the
boat
would
reach
a
given
point
and
by
means
of
some
native
method
of
telegraphing
such
as
by
means
of
wigwag
flags
or
smokes
the
news
could
be
hurried
up
the
river
much
in
advance
of
the
vessel
that
was
butting
against
the
strong
current
of
the
swollen
magdalena
then
frank
went
forward
to
have
a
long
talk
with
the
trusty
pilot
he
took
felipe
into
his
confidence
telling
him
for
the
first
time
all
about
their
sacred
mission
to
this
region
of
colombia
and
in
this
way
as
well
as
by
promising
to
double
his
regular
wages
frank
quite
won
the
old
fellow
heart
in
return
felipe
was
able
to
give
his
employer
considerable
valuable
information
connected
with
the
crew
frank
mentioned
no
names
and
hence
he
was
satisfied
that
he
had
made
no
mistake
in
his
calculations
when
among
the
list
of
suspects
given
by
the
pilot
both
enrique
and
little
cospita
were
included
we
must
get
rid
of
them
both
as
soon
as
possible
he
announced
so
just
before
night
sets
in
draw
the
boat
to
shore
near
some
village
or
town
then
i
shall
pay
both
men
off
get
their
signatures
to
the
fact
and
insist
on
their
going
ashore
meanwhile
as
you
find
opportunity
post
a
few
of
the
faithful
ones
to
the
fact
that
we
suspect
them
of
being
insurrectoes
felipe
declared
that
the
idea
was
superb
he
was
growing
more
and
more
fond
of
these
venturesome
young
americanos
who
were
so
generous
so
brave
and
who
had
come
all
this
great
distance
actuated
by
such
a
noble
purpose
so
many
a
man
may
easily
feel
when
his
salary
has
been
unexpectedly
doubled
during
the
balance
of
that
afternoon
the
two
young
aviators
continued
to
alternately
sit
upon
the
deck
and
wander
about
the
boat
watching
things
frank
had
the
precious
aeroplane
locked
up
in
the
spacious
lazerette
which
being
also
used
as
a
storeroom
for
extra
supplies
that
the
circumstance
need
not
be
looked
upon
as
singular
i
determined
that
no
ill
may
happen
to
that
machine
if
i
can
help
it
he
said
to
his
chum
when
speaking
of
what
he
had
had
done
and
andy
of
course
fully
endorsed
his
course
so
the
sun
began
to
draw
closer
to
the
western
horizon
represented
by
the
distant
mountains
where
the
chief
inland
town
of
the
province
sabanalarga
lay
felipe
had
spoken
of
a
place
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
river
where
they
could
draw
in
and
put
the
two
suspects
ashore
and
frank
told
andy
to
back
him
up
in
what
he
was
about
to
do
there
the
town
ahead
only
a
little
place
but
it
answers
our
purpose
for
they
can
never
say
we
deserted
them
in
the
howling
wilderness
and
frank
who
had
been
counting
out
some
money
started
to
make
his
way
down
to
the
waist
of
the
vessel
where
most
of
the
crew
had
gathered
wondering
what
the
object
of
the
landing
might
be
enrique
and
cospita
were
surely
very
much
astonished
and
alarmed
when
told
that
their
services
were
needed
no
longer
that
it
was
ascertained
they
were
carrying
too
many
men
and
also
that
they
were
to
receive
full
pay
for
the
time
they
had
engaged
of
course
they
started
to
make
objections
and
the
air
was
filled
with
various
excited
exclamations
but
frank
proved
as
firm
as
adamant
and
showed
the
automatic
revolver
sticking
from
his
pocket
all
the
while
a
fact
that
kept
the
two
men
from
venturing
to
do
more
than
shout
clutching
their
money
they
were
pushed
ashore
by
members
of
the
crew
who
doubtless
could
give
a
pretty
good
guess
as
to
what
the
whole
thing
meant
since
they
had
talked
with
felipe
a
good
riddance
of
bad
rubbish
declared
andy
as
the
boat
again
started
up
the
river
leaving
a
pair
of
yelling
natives
behind
making
all
sorts
of
furious
gestures
with
both
arms
yes
pursued
frank
reflectively
and
if
we
wanted
any
more
evidence
that
we
nipped
a
conspiracy
to
seize
the
vessel
in
the
bud
there
it
is
in
their
anger
at
being
paid
for
not
working
nothing
like
that
was
ever
known
before
down
in
this
country
as
felipe
says
and
now
andy
i
feel
that
we
another
step
nearer
the
carrying
out
of
your
great
task
oh
i
hope
so
said
the
other
his
face
marked
by
an
eagerness
that
told
of
the
one
sole
wish
of
his
youthful
heart
chapter
xi
out
of
the
frying
pan
into
the
fire
frank
took
the
first
watch
it
was
to
begin
about
ten
that
night
for
both
of
them
had
remained
on
deck
talking
up
to
that
hour
the
night
was
so
comfortable
after
the
hot
day
that
they
disliked
going
into
the
sleeping
quarters
these
happened
to
face
the
deck
however
so
that
the
vessel
was
admirably
suited
to
cruising
in
tropical
regions
every
thing
seems
to
be
going
on
decently
right
now
remarked
andy
yawning
as
he
prepared
to
have
a
few
hours
sleep
that
so
returned
his
chum
but
while
we
got
some
of
the
faithful
ones
on
duty
we
must
forget
that
there
may
be
other
snakes
aboard
enrique
and
the
little
shouter
may
not
have
been
all
the
sympathizers
with
the
revolutionists
and
not
for
a
minute
will
we
relax
our
vigilance
that
was
frank
way
and
just
now
andy
fully
approved
of
it
his
heart
was
so
set
upon
having
a
chance
to
use
the
monoplane
in
the
endeavor
to
discover
that
strange
valley
where
his
father
was
imprisoned
that
he
did
not
mean
to
take
any
chances
of
losing
out
through
over
confidence
so
he
packed
off
to
his
berth
while
frank
prepared
for
three
hours
of
lonely
vigil
he
expected
to
make
the
rounds
just
about
once
in
so
often
and
have
a
few
words
with
the
man
at
the
wheel
felipe
had
declared
that
it
was
his
intention
to
keep
busy
himself
through
the
night
since
he
dared
not
trust
the
wheel
in
the
hands
of
an
inexperienced
pilot
while
darkness
lasted
in
the
morning
he
could
give
directions
and
allow
an
assistant
to
do
the
work
while
he
secured
some
rest
there
was
no
moon
after
early
in
the
evening
when
the
young
queen
of
the
night
disappeared
in
the
west
leaving
the
bright
stars
to
control
the
skies
the
boat
continued
to
make
good
headway
against
the
current
though
at
this
season
of
the
year
the
magdalena
is
bank
full
with
the
summer
rains
which
fall
almost
every
afternoon
in
a
deluge
a
searchlight
sent
a
dazzling
shaft
of
light
far
ahead
on
the
troubled
surface
of
the
booming
flood
this
was
an
absolute
necessity
for
otherwise
it
would
have
been
too
dangerous
bucking
against
that
tide
laden
as
the
river
was
with
floating
tree
trunks
of
gigantic
size
that
had
been
swept
from
their
in
the
lowlands
above
once
frank
had
seen
a
wild
animal
crouched
on
one
of
these
great
logs
the
boat
passed
so
very
close
to
the
floating
refuge
of
the
beast
that
ere
darkness
claimed
the
strange
craft
with
its
stranger
cargo
frank
had
been
able
to
see
the
tawny
hide
of
the
crouching
beast
and
note
the
quick
jerky
motion
of
its
long
tail
upon
hurrying
to
the
pilot
house
and
making
inquiries
of
felipe
he
learned
that
just
as
he
suspected
the
animal
was
a
jaguar
the
most
feared
inhabitant
of
the
tropical
forests
away
off
at
the
headwaters
of
the
magdalena
and
orinoco
rivers
there
was
a
spice
of
peril
hovering
over
the
progress
of
the
little
boat
during
every
hour
of
that
night
it
might
come
in
the
sudden
leap
of
a
wild
animal
that
judged
any
port
would
be
better
than
a
floating
log
then
there
was
a
chance
of
their
running
afoul
of
a
monster
derelict
in
the
shape
of
a
drifting
snag
that
might
punch
a
hole
in
their
bow
and
bring
about
trouble
on
top
of
all
was
this
unseen
peril
from
the
revolutionists
who
were
making
the
magdalena
country
the
center
of
their
renewed
activity
for
some
reason
or
other
and
had
their
minds
set
on
securing
the
first
aeroplane
ever
known
to
be
in
colombia
the
time
passed
away
when
three
hours
had
really
gone
and
all
seemed
well
frank
awoke
his
chum
generous
to
a
fault
he
might
have
held
out
much
longer
for
he
did
not
feel
exhausted
but
andy
who
knew
him
like
a
book
had
made
him
promise
faithfully
on
his
word
of
honor
that
he
would
arouse
him
at
exactly
the
time
agreed
upon
everything
lovely
and
the
goose
hangs
high
frank
said
as
the
other
joined
him
presently
on
deck
that
good
replied
andy
and
as
it
is
now
one
with
no
trouble
doing
looks
good
to
me
that
we
pull
through
the
night
without
a
mess
you
never
can
tell
observed
the
careful
frank
and
the
only
way
to
do
is
to
act
just
as
if
you
felt
positive
something
was
bound
to
crop
up
i
know
it
came
the
reply
as
andy
started
to
walk
up
and
down
a
bit
so
as
to
get
the
last
remnant
of
drowsiness
out
of
his
system
for
an
hour
he
found
little
trouble
in
keeping
awake
he
made
frequent
trips
to
where
felipe
stood
at
his
wheel
his
keen
eyes
keeping
constant
vigil
ahead
in
order
that
he
might
steer
clear
of
such
snags
as
threatened
to
stove
a
hole
in
the
hull
of
the
steam
yacht
now
and
then
andy
could
see
one
of
the
crew
moving
about
but
as
some
of
them
must
have
duties
to
perform
even
in
the
night
he
did
not
look
upon
this
as
a
suspicious
circumstance
only
he
made
sure
that
no
one
wandered
in
the
near
vicinity
of
the
locked
lazerette
where
the
precious
monoplane
lay
securely
crated
in
some
places
the
river
proved
much
narrower
than
in
others
and
of
course
it
was
here
they
had
their
greatest
trouble
the
current
was
increased
for
one
thing
then
the
floating
objects
swept
forward
with
more
speed
so
that
it
required
additional
dexterity
in
order
to
avoid
them
but
old
felipe
knew
his
business
well
andy
believed
they
had
made
no
mistake
in
leaving
matters
fully
in
his
hands
it
was
about
the
end
of
his
second
hour
that
the
pilot
volunteered
some
information
that
gave
andy
more
or
less
uneasiness
just
ahead
young
señor
he
said
when
for
the
fifth
time
the
boy
entered
his
deck
pilot
house
we
come
to
the
narrowest
place
in
the
whole
river
at
this
section
and
there
if
anywhere
i
expect
that
they
will
be
waiting
for
us
do
you
mean
the
revolutionists
exclaimed
andy
interested
instantly
no
other
señor
if
we
manage
to
get
past
there
all
will
be
well
but
they
may
be
encamped
on
both
shores
and
demand
that
we
draw
in
under
penalty
of
being
fired
on
felipe
went
on
without
removing
his
snapping
black
eyes
for
even
a
single
second
from
the
panorama
of
shifting
water
and
floating
debris
that
the
searchlight
disclosed
ahead
of
the
laboring
boat
but
nothing
must
tempt
us
to
obey
no
matter
if
they
send
volleys
aboard
the
distance
is
too
far
for
them
to
do
much
damage
and
i
hear
they
are
as
a
rule
pretty
punk
shooters
felipe
may
hardly
have
known
what
that
word
meant
but
he
could
give
a
guess
but
sometimes
young
señor
they
even
have
cannon
he
remarked
you
do
say
ejaculated
andy
in
new
alarm
but
he
quickly
caught
himself
and
went
on
let
try
it
then
we
just
shut
off
the
searchlight
and
take
our
chances
for
a
while
with
the
old
floaters
on
the
river
then
perhaps
they
wo
see
anything
to
bang
away
at
anyhow
just
make
up
your
mind
felipe
we
do
haul
in
not
while
the
blessed
old
tub
keeps
above
water
it
is
good
to
hear
such
brave
talk
said
the
old
pilot
chuckling
me
i
will
keep
going
straight
ahead
no
matter
what
comes
until
i
have
the
order
from
you
to
turn
the
boat
yes
let
them
shoot
señor
after
all
i
do
not
believe
they
could
hit
the
side
of
a
palace
in
this
dark
all
the
same
andy
thought
he
ought
to
arouse
his
cousin
and
make
frank
aware
of
the
new
threatening
peril
on
hearing
the
facts
frank
agreed
with
all
the
one
on
guard
said
even
to
being
ready
to
extinguish
the
useful
searchlight
when
the
critical
moment
arrived
we
just
have
to
take
chances
that
all
he
declared
even
if
we
came
swat
up
against
one
of
those
floaters
that
no
reason
we
be
snagged
and
sunk
they
make
these
boats
pretty
strong
over
there
across
the
big
pond
and
i
guess
our
hull
could
stand
a
hard
punch
yes
remarked
andy
feeling
easier
now
that
frank
was
on
deck
ready
to
take
matters
in
his
able
hands
and
after
all
it
a
choice
between
two
bad
things
in
which
we
pick
out
the
lesser
hang
the
old
insurrectoes
i
say
why
ca
they
just
pay
attention
to
their
own
business
and
let
us
two
peaceful
bird
boys
alone
well
laughed
his
chum
you
know
how
it
is
yourself
when
you
want
something
pretty
hard
and
they
got
the
notion
in
their
stubborn
heads
that
if
they
only
had
a
modern
aeroplane
they
could
just
make
the
miserly
old
government
come
to
terms
instanter
blame
them
too
much
andy
maybe
you
and
i
would
do
the
same
thing
if
we
were
colombians
and
on
the
outs
looks
to
me
like
there
was
something
like
a
fire
ahead
frank
declared
andy
right
at
that
juncture
i
say
you
on
the
spot
every
time
old
fellow
observed
the
other
as
he
shaded
his
eyes
to
look
there
a
sharp
turn
ahead
where
felipe
says
we
enter
the
narrow
place
and
i
honestly
believe
they
got
a
bonfire
burning
on
the
bank
then
after
all
shutting
off
our
bully
little
searchlight
wo
do
us
much
good
complained
andy
regretfully
do
you
believe
it
frank
hastened
to
remark
a
fire
is
going
to
reach
all
the
way
across
the
river
which
is
pretty
wide
even
at
its
narrowest
part
and
depend
on
it
our
clever
old
wheelsman
will
keep
just
as
snug
up
against
the
left
hand
shore
as
he
dares
go
all
the
same
despite
these
assurances
from
his
cheerful
chum
andy
confessed
to
a
secret
feeling
of
apprehension
as
they
drew
closer
to
the
point
of
land
beyond
which
the
danger
possibly
lay
in
wait
it
seemed
to
him
that
every
conceivable
species
of
peril
threatened
the
sacred
enterprise
upon
which
he
had
so
eagerly
embarked
from
various
sources
did
harm
hover
over
their
heads
and
even
though
they
passed
safely
through
all
these
there
must
be
many
more
to
come
after
they
had
launched
their
little
airship
and
started
to
explore
the
strange
regions
of
this
tropical
land
it
a
fire
all
right
frank
he
said
as
they
negotiated
the
bend
and
opened
up
a
new
vista
ahead
yes
that
so
for
a
fact
returned
his
chum
and
notice
will
you
andy
how
old
felipe
has
managed
to
keep
over
well
toward
the
port
shore
he
sized
up
the
situation
all
right
and
knew
how
to
act
yes
felipe
tells
me
he
used
to
serve
in
the
army
many
a
battle
he
has
been
through
not
only
in
colombia
but
in
other
countries
as
well
he
was
once
something
of
a
soldier
of
fortune
but
where
are
you
going
frank
as
his
comrade
started
to
leave
him
i
must
warn
the
crew
to
keep
out
of
sight
or
they
may
be
hit
if
there
happens
to
be
any
shooting
going
on
called
the
other
over
his
shoulder
he
found
that
every
member
of
the
crew
seemed
to
be
awake
as
if
they
had
talked
the
situation
over
and
also
guessed
where
the
trouble
would
lie
in
wait
for
the
venturesome
young
americano
señors
so
frank
gave
his
warning
and
saw
that
they
obeyed
while
they
were
in
his
employ
he
felt
a
certain
degree
of
interest
in
these
ragged
fellows
and
did
not
wish
to
be
held
responsible
for
any
damage
they
might
receive
if
inclined
to
be
reckless
at
times
when
he
once
more
reached
andy
side
the
latter
was
looking
through
a
pair
of
marine
glasses
they
had
fetched
along
thinking
they
would
prove
especially
valuable
in
scrutinizing
the
country
over
which
they
might
be
passing
in
the
aeroplane
they
our
friends
the
revolutionists
i
reckon
he
announced
i
can
see
several
who
carry
big
swords
that
dangle
around
their
heels
and
the
common
soldiers
while
they
have
little
if
any
uniforms
and
some
of
them
no
shoes
seem
to
all
have
guns
in
their
hands
here
look
and
tell
me
what
that
is
on
the
little
rise
i
afraid
our
worst
fears
are
going
to
come
true
well
you
right
andy
replied
the
other
after
he
had
clapped
the
binoculars
to
his
eyes
that
a
cannon
all
the
same
and
getting
ready
to
shoot
oh
my
it
makes
a
fellow
flesh
just
creep
to
think
of
being
banged
away
at
with
a
great
big
cannon
declared
andy
this
one
is
so
very
big
i
think
and
now
we
nearly
opposite
where
the
fire
burns
they
going
to
make
a
move
to
show
their
hand
drop
down
flat
on
the
deck
andy
quick
with
you
and
frank
as
he
spoke
set
the
example
himself
hardly
had
the
two
boys
thus
thrown
themselves
down
than
there
was
a
heavy
boom
accompanied
by
a
brilliant
flash
of
fire
from
the
shore
the
revolutionists
had
fired
upon
the
little
steam
yacht
chapter
xii
a
great
surprise
wow
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
exclaimed
andy
raising
his
head
just
as
one
of
the
big
turtles
native
to
these
warm
waters
might
thrust
his
out
of
his
shell
why
that
was
only
a
warning
to
bring
us
up
short
and
pay
attention
declared
frank
because
as
you
saw
the
ball
splashed
the
water
ahead
of
our
bow
but
frank
we
do
mean
to
head
across
cried
andy
getting
up
on
his
knees
the
better
to
see
to
be
sure
we
do
that
was
all
settled
long
ago
and
you
notice
that
our
good
felipe
is
still
keeping
her
nose
headed
straight
upstream
now
out
goes
the
searchlight
just
as
we
arranged
wonder
what
they
think
that
means
perhaps
they
believe
they
knocked
it
overboard
with
that
shot
suggested
andy
who
could
joke
even
when
facing
troubles
as
thick
as
a
sea
fog
listen
frank
exclaimed
there
a
chap
with
a
pair
of
leather
lungs
shouting
a
lot
of
gibberish
i
suppose
he
demanding
our
surrender
and
threatening
to
blow
us
to
smithereens
if
we
decline
to
believe
him
one
good
thing
is
that
each
minute
takes
us
further
up
the
river
and
every
foot
counts
in
this
game
of
runaway
already
we
past
where
the
gun
stands
and
those
fellows
are
working
like
fun
to
get
her
turned
around
so
as
to
point
after
us
while
they
load
we
doing
more
stunts
yes
and
frank
we
leaving
in
the
lurch
i
do
believe
sure
thing
returned
frank
composedly
only
both
of
us
want
to
duck
when
it
looks
time
for
the
blamed
old
gun
to
bang
again
they
mean
business
from
the
word
go
now
and
will
shoot
to
hit
by
some
accident
it
might
run
afoul
of
the
boat
and
splinters
fly
there
get
ready
to
drop
andy
it
coming
it
certainly
was
for
immediately
another
flash
sprang
up
accompanied
by
the
same
deep
bellow
as
the
fieldpiece
was
discharged
no
doubt
while
it
may
have
been
rather
out
of
date
in
pattern
the
cannon
was
good
enough
to
have
done
savage
execution
handled
by
expert
german
or
french
gunners
but
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
such
among
the
army
of
the
new
aspirant
for
the
presidency
of
colombia
at
any
rate
the
missile
whizzed
and
whined
past
the
retreating
boat
missing
her
by
yards
bully
shouted
andy
jumping
up
and
cutting
a
few
pigeon
wings
on
the
deck
to
illustrate
just
how
pleased
he
was
by
the
time
they
ready
to
let
her
off
again
we
be
nearly
out
of
range
and
from
the
looks
of
the
bank
i
feel
pretty
sure
they
never
can
catch
up
with
us
toting
their
old
gun
along
three
minutes
later
there
came
the
third
report
and
they
heard
the
ball
pass
high
overhead
proving
that
the
marksmen
had
entirely
lost
all
traces
of
the
boat
and
simply
fired
at
random
that
settles
it
said
frank
decisively
do
you
think
so
asked
his
chum
joyously
no
question
about
it
andy
like
the
government
official
on
the
wharf
at
barranquila
they
realize
that
the
game
did
work
and
if
they
want
to
get
us
they
have
to
lay
some
new
plans
when
we
come
back
again
but
we
not
bothering
our
heads
about
that
you
know
never
even
cut
a
chip
off
our
boat
declared
andy
well
i
going
back
and
get
the
rest
of
my
nap
wake
me
up
at
four
remember
i
want
the
last
watch
and
frank
dove
within
his
stateroom
with
as
much
seeming
indifference
as
though
this
thing
of
being
fired
upon
with
fieldpieces
might
be
an
everyday
occurrence
in
his
experience
morning
dawned
upon
the
magdalena
frank
was
on
duty
at
the
time
and
drank
in
the
lovely
picture
birds
flew
overhead
cranes
arose
from
along
the
shallows
in
near
the
shore
where
they
had
been
fishing
for
their
breakfast
and
there
were
many
strange
feathered
creatures
to
be
seen
such
as
the
boy
had
never
up
to
now
set
eyes
upon
some
of
the
crew
were
trailing
fish
lines
astern
and
every
now
and
then
a
prize
would
be
hauled
aboard
which
later
on
might
afford
a
meal
for
passengers
and
workers
andy
soon
made
his
appearance
the
rising
sun
having
sent
a
few
slant
rays
into
his
sleeping
quarters
and
aroused
him
by
falling
on
his
face
this
is
something
like
eh
frank
he
remarked
as
he
drew
in
a
big
breath
of
the
bracing
morning
air
i
should
remark
yes
was
the
other
reply
we
apparently
left
all
our
dangers
behind
andy
ventured
that
is
i
mean
there
little
likelihood
of
our
being
robbed
of
our
precious
machine
now
with
both
government
officials
and
envious
revolutionists
left
in
the
lurch
i
was
just
asking
felipe
and
he
says
we
shall
have
another
day
and
night
of
bucking
up
against
this
nasty
current
you
see
andy
it
on
an
unusually
big
bender
right
now
which
makes
it
doubly
hard
to
fight
it
oh
well
what
ca
be
cured
must
be
endured
i
guess
so
i
try
to
take
it
as
easy
as
i
may
and
be
thankful
it
no
worse
andy
replied
the
morning
passed
without
any
event
worth
mentioning
and
all
the
while
they
kept
steadily
at
the
business
of
eating
up
some
of
the
two
hundred
miles
that
felipe
assured
them
lay
between
magangue
and
the
city
at
the
mouth
of
the
big
river
another
thing
was
worrying
andy
however
he
finally
broached
the
subject
to
his
comrade
knowing
that
in
this
way
he
would
get
relief
that
blessed
old
engine
has
been
doing
bully
for
a
long
time
now
frank
but
judging
from
past
experiences
she
due
for
another
sulky
fit
soon
whatever
would
we
do
if
she
let
down
all
of
a
sudden
while
we
were
right
in
the
worst
kind
of
a
swift
current
my
we
be
carried
miles
downstream
before
we
could
do
anything
oh
no
we
would
remarked
the
other
smiling
then
you
been
thinking
it
all
over
and
made
ready
to
offset
a
balk
i
bet
anything
declared
andy
with
vehemence
do
you
see
that
anchor
forward
asked
frank
pointing
from
where
they
stood
on
the
raised
deck
aft
well
that
got
a
good
long
stout
chain
attached
and
is
placed
where
a
kick
will
send
it
over
notice
old
quita
squatting
close
by
think
he
taking
a
snooze
he
seems
so
quiet
but
all
the
time
the
old
chap
on
the
alert
and
he
has
his
orders
too
to
upset
the
anchor
over
the
bow
you
mean
asked
andy
just
that
came
frank
reply
if
anything
happens
to
the
machinery
you
hear
a
series
of
quick
whistles
from
felipe
the
boat
wo
even
have
a
chance
to
lose
headway
before
over
plumps
the
big
mudhook
and
we
just
take
a
rest
out
in
the
river
until
repairs
can
be
made
again
by
engineer
mcclintock
and
his
assistants
andy
looked
at
his
chum
admiringly
blessed
if
you
do
just
think
of
everything
he
said
and
get
ready
long
before
it
happens
however
do
you
do
it
frank
oh
it
easy
once
you
make
up
your
mind
laughed
the
other
i
took
to
it
long
before
this
new
boy
scout
movement
started
you
know
got
as
their
leading
motto
the
words
prepared
and
there
never
was
a
better
slogan
ever
given
to
boys
think
how
many
things
might
be
avoided
if
we
were
always
prepared
yes
i
given
the
subject
much
thought
grumbled
andy
but
somehow
i
seem
to
slip
up
when
it
comes
to
the
critical
time
i
stay
awake
eleven
hours
and
just
when
i
doze
off
in
the
twelfth
watch
the
blamed
thing
happens
it
always
that
way
seems
to
me
how
can
a
fellow
stay
awake
all
the
time
tell
me
that
oh
rats
there
no
need
of
that
just
fix
things
so
you
be
aroused
when
it
comes
along
and
be
ready
to
turn
the
tables
so
they
talked
away
into
the
afternoon
the
engine
seemed
to
be
on
its
best
behavior
mcclintock
the
scotch
engineer
who
was
the
only
foreigner
aboard
besides
the
boys
reported
that
he
was
beginning
to
have
more
faith
in
the
machinery
the
work
of
the
last
twenty
odd
hours
had
certainly
been
a
pretty
heavy
tax
on
it
and
everything
seemed
to
be
going
like
clockwork
i
only
hope
it
keep
up
then
said
andy
one
more
night
is
all
i
ask
then
felipe
promises
to
have
us
at
our
journey
end
when
i
can
see
and
talk
to
the
very
man
who
picked
up
that
wonderful
little
parachute
with
its
message
from
the
unknown
valley
among
the
cliffs
i
wish
the
time
was
here
right
now
felipe
by
the
way
is
taking
his
rest
now
said
frank
after
a
little
time
for
he
expects
another
night
on
duty
we
still
meet
many
tree
trunks
sweeping
down
on
the
current
the
man
at
the
wheel
has
to
keep
on
guard
constantly
look
at
that
tremendous
one
will
you
andy
and
just
notice
how
dense
the
forest
is
ashore
around
here
how
any
one
can
get
around
at
all
beats
me
i
should
think
they
have
to
keep
their
machetes
busy
all
the
time
cutting
the
matted
vines
away
i
understand
they
do
the
other
went
on
and
i
rather
guess
that
there
hardly
a
country
under
the
sun
where
an
aeroplane
would
be
of
more
real
benefit
than
right
here
in
the
tropics
think
of
avoiding
all
that
tangle
of
floating
along
a
mile
a
minute
if
you
wanted
far
above
the
tree
tops
and
away
from
all
such
a
muss
you
right
agreed
frank
fervently
and
it
the
only
way
any
one
could
ever
hope
to
discover
this
strange
prison
of
your
father
from
a
distance
of
a
thousand
feet
we
can
have
a
big
range
of
vision
with
our
good
glass
it
will
not
be
hard
to
discover
the
cliffs
if
only
we
figure
out
in
which
direction
we
can
have
the
best
chance
and
i
think
i
got
a
scheme
ready
to
manage
that
i
depend
on
you
to
do
it
said
andy
alone
by
myself
i
would
simply
despair
of
ever
learning
anything
worth
while
but
while
you
are
along
i
just
feel
that
we
going
to
succeed
i
ought
to
thank
you
for
saying
that
but
i
wo
frank
declared
because
it
makes
me
tremble
for
my
reputation
as
a
prophet
but
you
have
seen
nothing
to
make
you
less
confident
i
hope
cried
the
other
to
be
sure
i
have
replied
frank
readily
enough
on
the
other
hand
i
ought
to
feel
better
satisfied
than
ever
because
we
managed
to
outwit
every
cause
for
trouble
that
has
cropped
up
this
far
get
through
this
coming
night
without
accident
because
we
ready
for
anything
then
when
another
day
dawns
we
haul
in
at
magangua
to
hunt
josé
mendoza
up
and
hear
what
he
can
tell
us
about
the
parachute
that
fell
among
his
cocoa
trees
hark
what
ails
the
men
forward
exclaimed
andy
just
then
they
sprang
to
their
feet
and
rushed
to
where
they
could
see
what
was
going
on
perhaps
a
mutiny
exclaimed
frank
who
could
not
tell
what
queer
thing
was
ever
going
to
happen
down
in
this
land
the
people
of
which
were
so
different
from
all
whom
he
had
ever
known
before
andy
uttered
a
low
cry
of
alarm
and
began
to
fumble
for
the
revolver
colonel
josiah
had
made
him
promise
to
always
carry
on
his
person
once
they
reached
the
country
of
revolutions
the
first
sight
they
obtained
told
them
that
something
unusual
had
indeed
happened
a
number
of
the
native
crew
were
in
range
of
their
vision
but
every
man
had
fallen
flat
on
his
face
and
seemed
to
be
cowering
there
as
if
afraid
what
in
the
dickens
is
it
gasped
andy
i
do
know
they
are
a
scared
lot
that
sure
perhaps
they
saw
a
sea
serpent
alongside
it
could
be
that
a
jaguar
has
boarded
us
no
look
at
old
quito
how
he
lifts
his
head
and
takes
a
terrified
look
why
he
seems
to
be
observing
something
up
above
in
the
heavens
as
sure
as
you
live
as
frank
shot
out
these
words
he
too
bent
his
head
back
to
scan
the
brazen
sky
above
a
cry
broke
from
his
lips
why
what
under
the
sun
does
it
mean
exclaimed
andy
who
had
also
turned
his
eyes
heavenward
to
discover
a
strange
thing
speeding
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
one
two
thousand
feet
high
and
at
the
same
time
there
came
to
his
ears
a
familiar
throbbing
that
could
have
but
one
meaning
an
aeroplane
he
burst
forth
in
thrilling
tones
and
the
sillies
down
there
think
it
just
a
frightfully
big
bird
about
to
carry
them
off
hey
frank
perhaps
the
government
has
got
one
of
the
new
contraptions
after
all
go
slow
said
frank
suppose
you
look
a
bit
closer
my
boy
there
something
familiar
about
that
same
craft
up
yonder
it
it
a
biplane
frank
gurgled
andy
yes
and
one
you
set
eyes
on
before
too
old
fellow
it
belongs
to
puss
carberry
burst
from
andy
quivering
lips
as
he
continued
to
stare
as
if
almost
unable
to
believe
his
own
eyes
chapter
xiii
the
yes
puss
carberry
and
his
crony
sandy
hollingshead
declared
frank
positively
but
it
seems
impossible
all
these
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
miles
away
from
old
bloomsbury
and
puss
carberry
floating
over
us
sure
i
must
be
dreaming
frank
stammered
the
other
still
gaping
up
at
the
rapidly
passing
aircraft
no
you
just
as
wideawake
as
ever
you
were
in
all
your
sweet
life
said
frank
take
a
better
look
andy
do
you
see
now
that
it
the
same
biplane
we
raced
with
the
day
sandy
dropped
that
bag
of
sand
hoping
to
break
our
winning
streak
in
the
dash
for
old
thunder
top
anyhow
it
a
ringer
for
it
i
give
you
my
word
muttered
the
stunned
boy
frank
with
an
exclamation
of
impatience
sprang
forward
and
snatched
something
up
that
had
just
caught
his
attention
this
proved
to
be
the
fine
field
glasses
that
had
been
brought
along
on
the
adventure
these
he
clapped
to
his
eye
and
as
they
were
already
fitted
and
adapted
to
his
sight
he
lost
not
a
second
in
covering
the
passing
aeroplane
look
for
yourself
my
boy
he
cried
handing
the
binoculars
over
to
andy
who
hastily
raised
them
well
i
declare
that
settles
it
ejaculated
that
individual
immediately
you
recognize
them
then
asked
frank
it
puss
as
sure
as
thunder
i
can
see
him
plain
the
other
is
just
out
of
line
but
there
something
about
his
figure
that
makes
me
ready
to
say
it
our
old
friend
sandy
andy
replied
amazement
still
gripping
him
tightly
well
frank
observed
after
all
the
only
queer
thing
about
it
is
our
glimpsing
them
so
soon
we
knew
they
were
headed
down
this
way
somewhere
but
they
made
quicker
time
than
our
best
and
just
to
think
that
they
the
first
to
fly
an
aeroplane
along
the
region
of
the
magdalena
huh
they
beat
us
up
in
the
air
that
other
time
yet
when
it
came
to
a
showdown
we
left
at
the
stake
andy
was
beginning
to
recover
his
breath
and
with
it
came
renewed
confidence
do
you
see
anything
in
the
actions
of
puss
that
would
indicate
he
had
recognized
us
aboard
this
boat
asked
frank
for
the
other
still
kept
the
glasses
glued
to
his
eyes
no
i
do
replied
andy
presently
you
see
they
awful
high
right
now
and
without
glasses
they
could
never
make
us
out
down
here
i
guess
you
right
was
frank
decision
perhaps
it
just
as
well
for
there
never
any
telling
what
mean
trick
those
fellows
have
got
up
their
sleeve
andy
suddenly
removed
the
glasses
and
a
sudden
pallor
seemed
to
cross
his
face
oh
frank
he
cried
you
do
believe
they
ever
be
so
wicked
as
to
try
and
stop
us
from
searching
for
my
father
do
you
bad
as
puss
carberry
is
i
ca
just
believe
he
ever
do
that
well
i
hope
not
returned
the
other
but
there
was
a
trifling
vein
of
doubt
in
his
voice
for
he
had
long
ago
ceased
trying
to
figure
to
what
depth
of
depravity
those
two
schemers
might
descend
but
where
do
you
suppose
they
came
from
right
now
frank
that
would
be
hard
to
tell
frank
replied
the
first
you
saw
of
them
they
were
sailing
up
over
yonder
then
the
chances
are
they
have
quartered
themselves
at
some
town
perhaps
on
the
river
and
that
this
is
just
their
first
flight
a
sort
of
look
over
the
country
yes
said
andy
they
circling
right
now
as
though
they
mean
to
head
back
again
well
you
ca
blame
them
much
frank
ventured
watching
the
actions
of
the
aviators
above
with
keenest
interest
night
is
so
very
far
away
and
i
should
think
a
fellow
would
hardly
feel
like
being
caught
out
after
dark
down
here
in
an
airship
well
hardly
andy
smiled
curfew
must
ring
for
us
every
time
fancy
dropping
plump
in
the
middle
of
such
a
jumble
of
forest
as
that
is
yonder
and
i
bet
you
it
just
cram
full
of
snakes
jaguars
and
everything
else
that
would
want
to
snuggle
up
to
a
poor
birdboy
dropped
out
of
the
clouds
me
for
daylight
when
i
go
sailing
down
in
this
blessed
region
look
the
men
are
beginning
to
recover
from
their
fright
remarked
frank
in
low
tones
there
old
quito
sitting
up
now
and
commencing
his
everlasting
jabbering
with
the
others
see
him
point
to
the
biplane
and
then
to
us
andy
say
the
sharp
old
coon
is
getting
a
pointer
on
us
he
telling
his
chums
right
now
that
the
thing
we
got
stored
away
in
the
lazerette
is
just
such
a
big
bird
as
that
going
away
over
yonder
am
i
right
frank
you
never
said
a
truer
thing
but
they
were
certainly
a
badly
rattled
crowd
for
a
time
and
we
can
hardly
blame
the
poor
fellows
for
what
could
they
think
but
that
it
was
a
tremendous
bird
of
prey
looking
them
over
with
an
eye
to
grub
frank
laughed
a
little
as
though
the
recollection
of
the
fright
of
the
crew
would
always
seem
more
or
less
ludicrous
they
sat
there
and
watched
until
the
mysterious
biplane
had
completely
disappeared
in
the
hazy
distance
that
marked
the
coming
of
evening
you
do
think
then
asked
andy
when
it
had
vanished
from
view
that
puss
and
his
biplane
could
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
colombia
authorities
and
that
they
using
it
for
scouting
to
learn
the
movements
of
these
ragged
revolutionists
no
i
do
was
frank
quick
response
you
said
you
could
positively
make
out
puss
at
the
wheel
and
i
almost
sure
it
was
sandy
with
him
they
must
have
slipped
into
the
country
without
giving
their
secret
away
trust
sly
puss
for
knowing
how
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
he
never
goes
around
with
a
brass
band
telling
what
big
things
he
has
on
tap
that
right
why
just
think
not
a
soul
knew
about
his
old
biplane
until
he
had
it
about
done
we
were
working
in
the
open
almost
telling
much
of
our
plans
but
puss
pretended
to
be
mighty
envious
and
asked
questions
when
all
the
time
he
was
meaning
to
beat
us
out
of
course
he
could
get
into
colombia
without
giving
his
secret
away
you
need
to
tell
me
frank
you
surprised
at
that
no
more
i
am
but
there
goes
the
sun
how
quick
it
seems
to
drop
out
of
sight
down
here
frank
remarked
sure
laughed
his
cousin
but
all
the
same
i
fail
to
hear
any
bang
you
remember
the
irish
immigrant
who
heard
the
sunset
gun
at
a
military
post
in
america
for
the
first
time
and
on
being
told
that
it
denoted
sunset
innocently
exclaimed
the
sun
niver
goes
down
in
ould
ireland
wid
a
bang
like
thot
but
already
the
dusk
is
creeping
out
of
the
dense
woods
on
to
the
river
and
i
getting
hungry
it
must
be
near
supper
time
i
wonder
what
the
folks
up
home
are
doing
right
now
just
what
we
are
likely
waiting
to
hear
a
welcome
sound
that
will
call
them
in
to
feed
and
there
comes
little
pepito
to
blow
the
conch
shell
that
he
uses
for
a
dinner
bell
come
andy
get
a
move
on
you
another
night
and
then
we
are
going
to
do
business
at
the
old
stand
it
will
be
just
fine
to
soar
above
this
strange
country
and
see
for
miles
and
miles
mountains
valleys
rivers
tropical
forests
and
everything
that
we
never
looked
down
on
before
the
two
young
aviators
went
into
the
cabin
for
supper
they
fared
very
well
insofar
as
food
was
concerned
of
course
both
of
them
missed
the
home
cookery
the
native
who
attended
to
this
part
of
the
program
did
his
level
best
to
please
and
he
certainly
had
plenty
to
work
with
but
his
spanish
style
of
serving
even
the
most
ordinary
dishes
of
tinned
meats
with
a
dash
of
garlic
was
beginning
to
pall
upon
the
taste
of
the
american
lads
frank
had
even
started
to
show
him
other
ways
of
cooking
and
they
had
hopes
of
converting
the
cook
by
slow
degrees
the
night
was
in
one
sense
a
repetition
of
the
preceding
one
true
they
would
not
have
to
consider
being
halted
by
a
gathering
army
of
the
revolutionists
and
that
was
a
comfort
all
around
at
the
same
time
frank
deemed
it
necessary
that
he
and
his
cousin
keep
watch
and
andy
was
perfectly
willing
to
sacrifice
some
of
his
personal
comfort
for
the
sake
of
insuring
the
safety
of
the
precious
aeroplane
it
proved
just
as
well
that
they
had
so
determined
during
second
term
on
guard
and
somewhere
around
four
while
darkness
covered
the
land
he
thought
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
shadow
crossing
the
deck
headed
in
the
direction
of
the
lazerette
he
had
been
lazily
reclining
on
a
soft
cushion
made
of
several
blankets
and
looking
up
at
the
silvery
stars
but
immediately
he
became
fully
aroused
this
might
mean
danger
in
some
shape
toward
the
aeroplane
and
no
matter
it
behooved
him
to
investigate
so
he
softly
arose
to
his
knees
and
crept
after
the
shadowy
figure
cautiously
he
approached
the
place
where
the
door
belonging
to
the
storeroom
was
to
be
found
as
he
advanced
thus
he
could
occasionally
catch
a
peculiar
clicking
sound
which
he
believed
must
be
made
by
some
one
trying
to
pick
the
lock
the
engine
of
the
boat
kept
up
considerable
of
a
racket
as
it
steadily
worked
along
without
the
dreaded
hitch
besides
there
was
always
more
or
less
splashing
of
water
against
the
sides
as
they
pushed
against
the
swift
current
of
the
magdalena
all
these
things
combined
to
muffle
the
clicking
sound
frequently
yet
during
little
lulls
frank
could
catch
it
again
the
tumult
also
served
to
deaden
any
shuffling
he
may
have
made
while
creeping
toward
the
lazerette
door
and
for
this
frank
was
thankful
it
was
very
gloomy
here
a
hanging
lantern
some
distance
away
only
served
to
accentuate
the
gloom
apparently
still
by
straining
his
eyes
frank
believed
he
could
just
manage
to
make
out
a
stooping
figure
at
the
door
yes
he
was
certain
that
it
had
just
moved
and
now
the
peculiar
clicking
was
much
plainer
when
it
stopped
he
remained
perfectly
motionless
nor
did
he
again
commence
his
creeping
forward
progress
until
it
started
once
more
frank
no
longer
had
the
slightest
doubt
concerning
the
cause
of
that
suspicious
clicking
one
of
the
crew
was
endeavoring
to
force
an
entrance
into
the
locked
lazerette
doubtless
with
the
intention
of
destroying
the
valuable
aeroplane
he
might
be
in
league
with
the
revolutionists
and
in
this
way
hoped
to
prevent
the
government
from
eventually
securing
possession
of
the
machine
which
would
put
the
insurrectos
out
of
the
running
but
frank
had
conceived
another
idea
he
now
believed
that
his
fellow
might
have
been
sent
by
the
crew
to
destroy
the
as
they
undoubtedly
considered
a
contraption
that
could
soar
through
space
as
fast
as
the
fleetest
condor
no
matter
it
was
his
business
to
put
a
sudden
stop
to
the
action
and
while
doing
so
he
must
not
be
too
rough
in
his
dealing
with
the
fellow
lest
the
entire
crew
rise
in
revolt
when
he
had
reached
a
point
that
allowed
of
a
leap
frank
suddenly
sprang
forward
he
did
not
know
just
what
he
might
be
up
against
and
had
even
taken
from
his
pocket
the
splendid
new
pistol
which
colonel
josiah
himself
a
world
traveler
had
insisted
upon
giving
each
of
his
boys
before
they
started
on
their
trip
south
surrender
cried
frank
believing
that
the
very
sound
of
his
voice
would
do
much
toward
frightening
the
traitor
but
he
hardly
expected
such
a
tremendous
upheaval
as
followed
the
man
believing
that
possibly
the
had
broken
out
of
its
cage
and
was
about
to
carry
him
off
in
its
gigantic
beak
gave
a
shrill
scream
of
terror
and
bouncing
up
broke
the
slender
hold
frank
had
secured
upon
his
person
not
to
be
outdone
frank
recovering
chased
after
him
he
believed
it
his
duty
to
at
least
learn
the
identity
of
the
rogue
so
that
he
might
understand
just
how
deeply
the
conspiracy
had
taken
root
in
the
crew
between
himself
and
the
hanging
lantern
he
could
make
out
the
fleeing
figure
of
the
fellow
and
hot
in
pursuit
he
followed
as
fast
as
his
feet
would
let
him
the
man
undoubtedly
heard
him
coming
for
if
anything
his
fright
increased
out
upon
the
open
deck
they
flew
frank
just
a
few
feet
in
the
rear
he
had
even
stretched
out
his
arm
and
touched
the
garments
of
the
runner
when
with
a
screech
the
fellow
made
a
furious
plunge
straight
over
the
side
of
the
boat
he
evidently
chose
to
take
chances
in
the
swift
current
of
the
magdalena
rather
than
trust
himself
in
the
power
of
the
unknown
pursuer
which
doubtless
he
believed
to
be
the
dreaded
that
had
been
confined
in
the
box
cage
chapter
xiv
the
airship
launched
at
last
frank
came
near
following
after
the
unknown
member
of
the
crew
when
the
other
made
that
flying
leap
over
the
side
of
the
boat
not
that
he
wanted
to
take
a
bath
just
then
but
his
forward
progress
had
been
rapid
and
he
only
saved
himself
by
banging
up
against
the
taffrail
which
was
unusually
high
for
so
small
a
vessel
and
holding
on
sturdily
he
had
heard
the
splash
as
the
fellow
reached
the
water
doubtless
he
was
a
good
swimmer
as
about
all
these
natives
seemed
to
be
and
barring
his
falling
a
prey
to
some
loitering
alligator
or
other
reptile
he
would
be
able
to
gain
the
neighboring
shore
further
down
at
any
rate
it
was
folly
to
think
of
looking
for
him
what
all
the
row
cried
andy
as
he
came
plunging
forth
from
his
stateroom
some
of
the
crew
were
even
then
looking
over
the
side
and
frank
imagined
they
could
give
a
pretty
good
guess
as
to
what
it
meant
but
he
heard
not
a
word
from
even
old
quito
and
while
the
absence
of
a
man
must
be
noticed
in
the
morning
there
would
probably
be
no
complaint
when
andy
heard
about
the
attempt
to
injure
the
monoplane
he
was
in
a
tremble
did
you
ever
he
exclaimed
why
it
seems
as
though
everything
just
wants
to
knock
us
when
we
give
the
government
officials
the
merry
ha
ha
and
even
slip
past
the
revolutionary
army
after
being
bombarded
by
their
old
cannon
here
even
our
own
men
want
to
smash
our
precious
aeroplane
under
the
belief
that
it
an
evil
bird
come
to
bring
bad
luck
to
the
people
better
go
back
to
your
bunk
and
forget
it
remarked
frank
who
was
tenderly
rubbing
his
elbow
where
it
had
come
in
contact
with
the
hard
taffrail
at
the
time
he
stopped
so
suddenly
balking
at
a
bath
me
not
on
your
life
frank
declared
andy
with
much
emphasis
going
to
take
a
blanket
and
just
lie
down
in
front
of
that
blessed
door
nobody
can
get
in
then
without
walking
over
my
body
and
if
i
catch
a
fellow
trying
it
on
believe
me
i
give
him
something
he
wo
forget
in
a
hurry
it
be
touch
and
go
with
him
i
bet
you
which
he
actually
did
much
to
frank
secret
amusement
camping
out
there
on
the
floor
as
close
to
the
locked
door
as
he
could
get
and
bracing
his
back
up
against
the
same
but
then
fortunately
morning
was
not
so
far
away
and
andy
would
have
only
a
couple
of
hours
more
or
less
of
his
labor
they
knew
that
if
the
pilot
of
the
river
expedition
said
truly
they
must
even
now
be
drawing
near
the
town
of
magangue
possibly
it
would
break
upon
their
vision
with
the
coming
of
dawn
frank
himself
had
no
more
intention
of
retiring
to
his
bed
than
had
andy
but
continued
to
keep
watch
and
ward
until
he
saw
the
first
peep
of
daylight
over
the
port
side
of
the
vessel
then
he
communicated
the
glad
intelligence
to
his
chum
and
together
they
stood
there
watching
the
slow
unfolding
of
dawn
from
an
ashen
gray
the
sky
began
to
be
marked
with
brighter
hues
pink
flushes
traveled
along
in
lines
that
centered
in
the
spot
where
the
sun
would
presently
appear
and
the
gloom
of
night
retreated
once
more
back
to
its
hiding
places
among
the
mountain
passes
there
the
dinky
old
town
cried
andy
pointing
with
trembling
finger
it
is
and
no
mistake
replied
frank
himself
experiencing
a
sensation
of
considerable
relief
for
at
times
it
had
seemed
more
than
doubtful
whether
the
little
expedition
could
ever
overcome
the
many
difficulties
that
beset
its
passage
up
the
swollen
river
and
so
they
came
to
land
just
as
the
glorious
sun
showed
his
smiling
face
andy
declared
that
this
was
a
harbinger
of
good
luck
and
his
cousin
chose
to
readily
agree
with
all
he
said
for
it
pleased
him
to
see
andy
look
more
like
his
old
self
than
he
had
been
for
many
a
day
remember
only
one
of
us
ashore
at
a
time
until
we
land
this
cargo
remarked
frank
as
they
came
to
bring
the
boat
to
the
bank
where
a
group
of
natives
waited
to
see
what
it
all
meant
surprise
written
largely
on
their
dark
faces
that
right
responded
the
other
traveler
but
i
going
to
have
the
aeroplane
carried
out
on
deck
at
once
so
it
can
be
taken
ashore
as
soon
as
we
find
where
we
are
at
what
we
want
first
of
all
is
to
hear
about
our
friend
carlos
mendoza
the
cocoa
planter
perhaps
he
lives
miles
away
and
we
have
to
get
some
sort
of
conveyance
to
tote
our
machine
out
to
his
place
yes
observed
frank
i
been
laying
out
plans
along
that
line
if
you
do
mind
i
drop
ashore
while
you
having
the
crates
brought
on
deck
and
make
inquiries
even
away
down
here
in
this
wilderness
money
talks
colonel
josiah
told
us
it
did
for
him
in
the
heart
of
darkest
africa
you
know
and
a
few
bolivars
will
hire
all
the
help
we
want
andy
was
perfectly
agreeable
that
his
companion
should
have
taken
upon
himself
the
task
of
engineering
things
you
can
always
discount
me
when
it
comes
to
bargaining
he
said
laughingly
so
go
ahead
and
fix
things
to
suit
yourself
frank
upon
reaching
shore
frank
who
had
taken
old
felipe
along
with
him
to
serve
as
interpreter
found
that
carlos
mendoza
had
his
home
just
on
the
border
of
the
town
though
it
was
a
little
distance
away
he
soon
made
arrangements
for
hiring
a
native
cart
to
be
used
in
transporting
the
precious
aeroplane
in
less
than
half
an
hour
they
were
on
the
way
the
boat
had
been
left
in
charge
of
mcclintock
the
scotch
engineer
who
would
make
sure
that
the
crew
remained
on
board
or
lost
the
wages
coming
to
them
both
of
the
boys
were
so
excited
that
they
paid
little
attention
to
the
strange
scenes
which
now
surrounded
them
in
the
valley
town
far
back
in
the
interior
of
tropical
colombia
indeed
one
might
even
have
suspected
that
they
had
always
been
accustomed
to
living
in
a
region
where
all
manner
of
tropical
fruits
abounded
coffee
and
cocoa
were
raised
as
crops
and
birds
of
brilliant
plumage
flew
overhead
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
they
knew
they
would
presently
come
face
to
face
with
the
planter
who
had
actually
picked
up
the
little
messenger
sent
out
of
his
cliff
bordered
prison
by
professor
bird
and
this
fact
set
their
nerves
to
trembling
with
eager
anticipations
in
due
time
the
cart
on
which
the
aeroplane
had
been
secured
together
with
the
luggage
which
the
young
aviators
wished
to
carry
along
drew
up
before
a
long
low
white
building
back
of
which
could
be
seen
orange
trees
and
other
evidences
of
a
real
tropical
home
their
coming
must
have
been
noted
for
a
gentleman
was
advancing
from
the
grove
at
the
rear
señor
carlos
looked
surprised
at
seeing
the
caravan
bringing
up
before
his
door
but
that
was
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
his
amazement
upon
learning
how
one
of
the
two
young
americanos
was
the
same
andrew
bird
to
whom
he
had
desired
his
friend
señor
almirez
to
forward
the
strange
message
picked
up
in
his
cocoa
grove
one
day
several
months
back
the
boys
had
learned
from
señor
josé
that
the
owner
of
the
plantation
could
understand
english
and
even
speak
it
fairly
well
thus
they
had
no
need
of
fetching
felipe
along
to
act
as
interpreter
oh
please
first
of
all
let
me
see
the
remains
of
the
silk
parachute
that
was
attached
to
the
bark
letter
said
andy
after
they
had
conversed
for
a
short
time
and
some
of
the
planter
hired
servants
had
unloaded
the
boxed
aeroplane
which
was
stowed
away
in
a
place
of
security
doubtless
the
planter
understood
the
reason
for
the
boy
solicitude
he
immediately
took
them
inside
the
house
and
in
another
minute
had
thrust
into
andy
eager
hands
a
discolored
piece
of
silk
such
as
is
used
in
the
making
of
balloons
nor
did
either
frank
or
the
colombian
planter
think
it
strange
that
the
boy
should
press
the
token
again
and
again
to
his
lips
while
tears
ran
down
his
face
they
could
understand
the
feelings
that
filled
his
heart
and
no
matter
what
the
nationality
may
be
the
honest
love
of
a
lad
for
his
father
can
not
but
provoke
admiration
and
respect
and
now
said
frank
presently
when
his
cousin
had
in
a
measure
recovered
from
his
first
emotion
will
you
tell
us
señor
mendoza
just
how
you
found
this
strange
communication
i
hope
you
remember
the
exact
day
because
it
is
of
the
greatest
importance
to
us
that
we
learn
as
near
as
possible
from
just
what
quarter
it
came
si
señor
i
understand
that
replied
the
planter
eagerly
his
dark
face
aglow
with
enthusiasm
i
made
note
of
the
day
in
my
diary
also
the
fact
that
it
was
the
third
day
in
succession
when
the
wind
blew
direct
from
the
south
with
just
a
faint
turn
to
the
west
splendid
cried
frank
turning
to
give
his
chum
a
reassuring
nod
what
did
i
tell
you
andy
the
forethought
of
señor
carlos
has
made
our
task
much
easier
there
can
be
little
doubt
then
that
the
hot
air
balloon
must
have
started
in
a
region
that
lies
almost
due
south
of
here
possibly
with
a
slant
as
he
says
toward
the
south
by
west
quarter
as
a
sailor
would
call
it
and
now
señor
can
you
tell
us
just
where
a
direct
line
that
way
would
bring
us
first
over
the
lowland
and
the
forests
then
if
you
go
far
enough
amigos
it
is
the
sierra
san
jeronimo
mountains
you
would
strike
replied
the
planter
yes
i
remember
them
on
the
map
we
have
and
that
corresponds
exactly
with
all
i
had
in
my
mind
frank
observed
his
forehead
wrinkled
with
serious
thought
what
sort
of
country
is
it
up
in
those
mountains
asked
andy
the
planter
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
i
am
unable
to
tell
you
amigos
since
i
have
never
been
there
from
all
i
have
heard
i
believe
it
is
one
of
the
wildest
and
most
inaccessible
regions
in
all
our
country
lofty
peaks
warn
back
the
most
daring
explorer
few
have
ever
ventured
to
attempt
to
go
among
them
some
never
came
back
they
say
the
superstitious
declare
those
mountains
are
filled
with
evil
things
nothing
on
earth
could
tempt
one
of
my
peons
to
accompany
an
expedition
thither
then
it
is
lucky
that
we
will
not
need
any
assistance
in
our
adventure
remarked
frank
with
an
aeroplane
one
may
be
independent
of
help
and
now
andy
what
shall
we
do
it
will
take
us
the
better
part
of
the
day
to
assemble
our
little
flier
and
get
things
ready
for
an
ascent
that
means
another
horrible
night
of
waiting
before
we
can
make
a
start
said
andy
looking
quite
forlorn
but
he
soon
understood
that
it
could
not
be
helped
both
boys
were
presently
hard
at
work
with
the
deeply
interested
planter
watching
every
move
all
the
while
they
conversed
and
the
subject
of
pretty
much
all
their
talk
had
more
or
less
to
do
with
the
country
the
peculiarities
of
climate
what
sort
of
weather
they
might
expect
to
have
and
dozens
of
similar
matters
doubtless
señor
mendoza
would
like
to
hear
of
things
connected
with
the
great
outside
world
which
he
seldom
saw
anything
of
but
he
realized
that
these
would
keep
until
after
the
brave
young
señors
had
completed
their
task
of
humanity
before
evening
came
they
had
everything
arranged
to
suit
the
critical
frank
both
boys
were
pleased
to
find
that
the
monoplane
had
come
through
its
long
journey
without
any
damage
having
been
done
that
night
they
were
uneasy
about
the
precious
airship
and
at
their
request
the
planter
had
their
beds
made
up
in
the
shed
where
the
bug
lay
but
there
was
no
attempt
made
to
injure
it
in
the
least
then
came
the
morning
andy
could
hardly
eat
a
bite
of
breakfast
for
the
eagerness
that
possessed
his
soul
every
servant
on
the
plantation
had
gathered
to
look
with
awe
upon
the
wonderful
machine
on
which
it
was
whispered
these
two
venturesome
young
americanos
meant
to
soar
among
the
clouds
finally
the
last
word
was
spoken
the
planter
shook
hands
with
each
of
his
visitors
frank
turned
on
the
power
the
aeroplane
with
the
motor
exhaust
sounding
like
a
volley
of
musketry
started
to
run
along
the
level
ground
and
presently
to
the
consternation
of
the
entire
gathering
began
to
climb
upward
just
like
a
creature
of
magic
cries
of
awe
arose
from
scores
of
throats
and
to
a
man
the
peons
threw
themselves
flat
on
their
faces
hardly
daring
to
look
at
the
terrifying
spectacle
chapter
xv
an
unpleasant
surprise
at
last
frank
we
on
the
move
yes
replied
the
one
at
the
wheel
as
the
cries
and
cheers
from
below
were
drowned
by
the
volleying
motor
explosions
and
did
you
see
the
señor
kissing
his
hand
after
us
while
his
men
were
flat
on
their
faces
it
was
a
queer
sight
andy
remarked
and
no
wonder
these
ignorant
peons
call
our
little
monoplane
a
look
down
now
just
to
think
of
two
yankee
boys
being
allowed
to
swing
over
a
tropical
scene
like
that
said
frank
both
of
them
were
deeply
interested
in
the
valley
they
could
see
the
little
town
with
the
river
stretching
off
toward
the
south
then
there
were
the
patches
of
tropical
vegetation
the
fruit
trees
and
the
cocoa
plantations
all
those
interesting
things
which
neither
of
them
had
ever
set
eyes
on
before
señor
mendoza
had
told
them
how
the
coffee
was
grown
upon
a
certain
part
of
the
mountain
slopes
since
it
did
not
do
well
in
the
valleys
preferring
a
higher
altitude
they
followed
the
course
of
the
river
generally
intending
to
cover
possibly
something
like
eighty
or
ninety
miles
before
trying
to
comb
the
land
from
side
to
side
in
the
endeavor
to
find
the
strange
cliff
enclosed
valley
from
time
to
time
andy
would
call
the
attention
of
his
aeroplane
chum
to
some
striking
feature
of
the
landscape
far
below
the
little
kinkaid
motor
was
humming
merrily
without
ever
missing
a
stroke
and
frank
having
the
utmost
confidence
in
its
steadiness
now
after
so
many
trial
spins
could
take
a
few
seconds
at
a
time
to
observe
these
things
when
we
gone
something
close
on
an
hundred
miles
direct
remarked
the
pilot
of
the
craft
presently
i
think
we
better
make
a
descent
if
given
the
chance
you
spoke
of
that
before
remarked
his
companion
anxiously
what
is
the
reason
for
doing
it
frank
oh
nothing
serious
replied
the
other
we
will
then
be
at
the
parting
of
the
ways
you
know
you
mean
we
be
about
to
leave
the
river
that
will
have
been
our
guide
up
to
then
asked
andy
yes
frank
admitted
and
from
that
time
forward
we
must
simply
depend
on
our
judgment
for
everything
in
that
event
it
might
be
well
if
we
looked
over
the
entire
plant
to
make
sure
everything
was
in
shape
andy
breathed
freer
oh
i
agree
with
you
there
he
hastened
to
say
and
i
glad
you
had
any
more
serious
reason
but
did
you
ever
see
such
a
picture
in
all
your
born
days
just
look
at
the
forest
bordering
the
river
think
of
trying
to
push
through
such
a
dense
mass
of
jungle
and
i
bet
it
just
full
of
snakes
poisonous
spiders
lizards
and
all
such
things
not
to
mention
such
trifling
citizens
as
jaguars
ocelots
tapirs
alligators
crocodiles
and
their
kind
laughed
frank
ugh
what
lucky
fellows
we
are
to
be
away
up
here
where
we
can
skim
along
at
the
rate
of
thirty
miles
an
hour
easily
without
half
trying
and
snap
our
fingers
at
all
those
things
i
tell
you
frank
this
aviation
business
is
the
greatest
thing
that
ever
came
down
the
pike
so
they
continued
from
time
to
time
to
converse
as
they
kept
pushing
along
following
the
winding
course
of
the
swollen
river
that
could
be
plainly
seen
below
between
its
banks
of
forest
frank
did
not
soar
high
at
this
time
there
seemed
no
need
and
besides
both
of
the
boys
were
deeply
interested
in
watching
the
various
changes
that
kept
taking
place
in
the
checkerboard
landscape
below
several
times
during
the
first
hour
they
passed
over
hamlets
or
villages
on
such
occasions
it
was
ludicrous
to
observe
the
excitement
that
occurred
the
bird
boys
would
not
have
been
true
to
their
nature
had
they
not
enjoyed
the
tremendous
sensation
which
the
sudden
and
unheralded
appearance
of
the
aeroplane
caused
in
these
river
settlements
loud
shouts
floated
up
to
them
that
constantly
grew
in
volume
men
yelled
women
and
children
screamed
many
fell
flat
on
their
faces
others
tried
to
conceal
themselves
as
though
they
belonged
to
a
covey
of
wild
ducks
over
which
a
hungry
eagle
hovered
picking
out
his
contemplated
dinner
and
the
last
thing
andy
would
see
as
he
looked
back
would
be
wildly
running
figures
gesticulating
furiously
and
evidently
next
door
to
crazy
with
excitement
apparently
these
natives
believed
that
the
aeroplane
must
be
a
visitor
from
another
world
or
else
some
monster
bird
of
a
family
long
understood
to
be
extinct
the
second
hour
had
nearly
ended
and
everything
seemed
to
be
moving
along
smoothly
frank
saw
not
a
cloud
on
the
horizon
thus
far
surely
this
augured
well
for
the
ultimate
success
of
their
strange
expedition
suddenly
he
heard
andy
give
vent
to
a
cry
of
alarm
what
is
it
he
demanded
quickly
turn
her
upward
quick
they
are
going
to
shoot
at
us
shouted
the
other
frank
instantly
started
to
obey
and
while
their
forward
progress
still
continued
unabated
the
aeroplane
commenced
to
head
toward
a
higher
altitude
immediately
he
heard
the
dull
report
of
a
gun
from
below
he
dared
not
bend
his
head
to
look
since
all
his
attention
was
needed
to
take
care
of
his
machine
at
such
a
critical
moment
but
the
whine
of
the
bullet
as
it
passed
close
by
was
very
plainly
heard
then
came
other
shots
many
of
them
and
the
air
seemed
full
of
strange
hissing
sounds
twice
frank
felt
a
slight
shock
that
told
him
some
part
of
the
aeroplane
had
been
struck
by
one
of
the
flying
missiles
his
heart
seemed
to
jump
almost
into
his
mouth
as
he
trembled
for
the
result
but
nothing
happened
the
motor
kept
up
its
insistent
humming
and
there
was
not
a
quiver
to
indicate
that
a
vital
part
of
the
monoplane
had
been
injured
andy
are
you
hurt
he
called
after
the
volley
had
ceased
the
marksmen
below
having
evidently
exhausted
their
ammunition
only
a
scratch
came
the
reply
hardly
drew
blood
think
a
splinter
from
the
wood
where
a
spent
bullet
zipped
past
must
have
hit
me
all
right
frank
we
ran
the
gantlet
just
fine
but
all
the
same
i
guess
it
would
be
better
for
us
to
keep
a
little
higher
after
this
did
you
make
them
out
and
were
they
government
troops
do
you
think
frank
asked
for
though
he
managed
to
turn
his
head
already
had
they
made
such
speed
that
only
the
interminable
forest
could
be
seen
in
their
rear
no
returned
his
comrade
i
just
reckon
it
was
another
camp
of
these
insurrectos
you
remember
the
señor
said
there
were
apt
to
be
more
than
one
crowd
of
them
up
the
river
it
the
only
way
to
get
in
and
out
of
this
country
and
everything
that
happens
has
to
count
on
a
water
route
i
guess
the
magdalena
is
about
the
same
to
this
part
of
colombia
that
the
old
nile
is
to
all
egypt
well
it
was
a
narrow
escape
all
right
frank
declared
i
do
just
like
the
sound
of
those
bullets
all
around
when
you
six
or
eight
hundred
feet
up
in
the
air
andy
had
recovered
from
his
recent
fright
by
now
and
could
even
laugh
i
should
say
nix
he
observed
especially
when
you
know
that
one
little
clip
on
either
wing
would
upset
us
like
a
stone
excuse
me
if
you
please
i
never
be
fully
happy
when
flying
until
we
invent
some
sort
of
little
parachute
that
in
case
of
a
drop
will
give
a
fellow
a
chance
for
his
money
another
hour
passed
when
frank
declared
they
had
now
reached
the
point
where
a
descent
would
be
advisable
in
case
they
found
an
opening
that
looked
suitable
there
are
the
mountains
over
yonder
on
the
right
he
said
and
from
now
on
we
had
better
begin
to
scour
the
country
covering
every
mile
just
as
though
we
had
a
comb
and
meant
to
explore
it
all
the
chance
to
drop
came
presently
and
as
the
opening
proved
everything
they
could
desire
a
landing
was
made
without
the
least
trouble
here
they
rested
and
partook
of
a
light
lunch
having
brought
plenty
of
provisions
along
together
with
a
gun
of
the
latest
repeating
type
with
which
colonel
josiah
had
presented
them
frank
upon
looking
the
aeroplane
over
a
little
later
discovered
that
he
had
been
wise
in
deciding
to
make
a
halt
there
was
need
of
some
attention
certain
parts
had
become
weakened
by
the
strain
either
in
the
long
voyage
and
handling
on
board
the
steamer
or
else
in
this
new
flight
he
was
determined
to
be
thorough
in
all
he
did
and
this
consumed
more
or
less
time
so
that
when
he
finally
pronounced
the
monoplane
in
perfect
condition
the
afternoon
was
half
gone
still
they
must
go
up
and
put
in
an
hour
or
two
searching
andy
was
too
wild
with
impatience
to
hear
of
anything
else
and
frank
saw
no
reason
for
not
complying
but
we
must
be
sure
to
get
down
again
before
night
comes
he
remarked
after
they
had
made
a
successful
rise
and
were
speeding
above
the
top
of
the
thick
forest
if
we
should
be
caught
out
at
night
i
rather
guess
it
would
be
a
serious
piece
of
business
and
andy
agreed
with
him
for
quite
a
time
they
soared
aloft
andy
using
the
binoculars
almost
constantly
watching
the
country
below
and
occasionally
sweeping
the
distance
frank
was
thrilled
to
hear
his
chum
suddenly
give
utterance
to
a
cry
but
it
was
more
of
amazement
than
delight
that
gave
birth
to
this
ejaculation
what
is
it
now
andy
more
insurrectos
he
demanded
ready
to
manipulate
the
planes
and
strike
for
higher
regions
no
no
not
this
time
came
the
quick
reply
but
frank
as
sure
as
you
live
there
that
plagued
old
biplane
just
rising
up
yonder
a
mile
away
and
somehow
i
seem
to
feel
that
it
spells
trouble
for
us
chapter
xvi
the
air
chase
one
hasty
glance
told
frank
that
there
could
be
no
mistake
only
too
well
did
he
know
the
construction
of
that
same
biplane
that
had
in
the
near
past
competed
with
them
for
honors
in
the
race
for
old
thunder
top
crown
you
right
andy
he
said
earnestly
and
it
seems
to
me
heading
for
us
right
now
what
do
you
make
them
out
to
be
can
you
see
who
is
handling
the
wheel
is
it
puss
carberry
yes
i
dead
sure
of
that
but
frank
there
somebody
else
with
him
sandy
asked
his
chum
no
it
ca
be
there
i
had
a
good
look
at
him
and
frank
he
got
a
beard
it
a
man
answered
andy
in
tense
tones
frank
first
action
was
to
move
a
lever
that
would
change
their
course
and
place
the
biplane
directly
behind
them
his
next
was
to
throw
on
more
speed
so
that
the
faithful
little
motor
started
to
humming
with
the
rapidity
that
reminded
andy
of
the
occasion
when
they
put
it
to
its
best
efforts
in
order
to
rush
ahead
of
their
rival
of
the
air
then
we
must
guess
from
that
puss
and
sandy
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
rebels
since
there
are
no
government
troops
up
here
the
señor
said
he
observed
presently
are
they
gaining
on
us
now
andy
i
do
think
so
replied
the
one
who
held
the
glass
though
puss
seems
to
be
getting
a
whole
lot
of
speed
out
of
his
gnome
engine
right
now
reckon
he
must
have
overhauled
it
or
else
found
some
way
to
put
her
up
another
notch
how
strange
to
think
that
our
old
rivalry
is
being
renewed
away
down
here
in
this
country
thousands
of
miles
from
home
remarked
frank
after
a
while
huh
seems
to
me
there
would
be
something
doing
if
you
happened
to
run
across
puss
carberry
at
the
other
side
of
the
world
declared
andy
the
race
kept
up
for
some
time
neither
seeming
to
gain
to
any
appreciable
extent
of
course
both
boys
were
keyed
up
to
a
state
of
intense
nervousness
passing
through
the
air
at
this
fearful
speed
fully
five
hundred
feet
above
the
ground
was
surely
enough
to
excite
them
one
little
accident
and
they
would
hardly
know
enough
to
give
a
single
shout
of
horror
before
the
end
must
rush
upon
them
and
yet
frank
appeared
as
cool
as
though
sitting
beside
a
camp
fire
laying
out
some
contemplated
air
cruise
on
paper
andy
was
full
of
complaints
aw
now
whatever
do
you
suppose
those
measly
old
insurrectos
want
to
chase
us
for
in
this
style
he
growled
we
attending
to
our
private
business
and
not
bothering
them
one
little
bit
why
do
they
leave
a
fellow
alone
goodness
knows
we
just
got
trouble
enough
on
our
hands
without
this
i
do
know
said
frank
reflectively
but
i
reckon
they
either
want
our
monoplane
or
else
believe
we
in
the
employ
of
the
government
and
have
been
sent
up
here
to
spy
on
their
movements
anyhow
it
seems
plain
that
they
mean
to
make
a
big
effort
to
get
us
which
they
wo
if
we
know
it
cried
andy
but
see
here
frank
that
chap
is
nervy
all
right
going
up
with
puss
and
standing
all
this
racket
a
tenderfoot
is
generally
rattled
even
with
a
slow
flight
he
seems
to
be
holding
out
i
been
thinking
about
that
replied
his
chum
and
andy
it
looks
to
me
as
if
that
fellow
must
know
something
about
aviation
if
i
could
only
glimpse
him
through
the
glasses
i
soon
tell
for
he
show
it
by
the
way
he
sits
there
alongside
puss
a
new
beginner
would
be
hugging
the
upright
for
dear
life
and
showing
all
the
signs
of
fear
yes
i
know
because
i
did
that
same
answered
andy
once
again
raising
the
binoculars
as
he
twisted
his
head
around
how
is
it
asked
frank
not
much
signs
of
fright
about
him
as
far
as
i
can
see
came
the
ready
reply
then
make
up
your
mind
he
been
up
in
an
aeroplane
before
perhaps
he
some
french
or
german
who
has
thrown
his
fortunes
in
with
the
man
who
wants
to
sit
in
the
presidential
chair
at
bogota
and
in
his
own
country
he
must
have
seen
something
of
aviation
oh
well
it
make
much
difference
to
us
we
just
have
to
keep
them
at
a
distance
and
take
our
chances
but
frank
yes
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
andy
that
night
will
soon
be
coming
swooping
down
on
us
that
so
and
i
sorry
in
one
way
for
it
going
to
be
a
tough
old
job
finding
a
suitable
place
to
fold
our
wings
on
in
the
darkness
but
we
up
against
it
good
and
hard
you
see
and
it
what
you
might
call
hobson
choice
andy
showed
more
positive
signs
of
anger
what
business
have
they
got
bothering
us
this
way
he
grumbled
say
do
you
suppose
it
would
be
all
right
for
me
to
try
a
few
shots
at
with
the
fine
marlin
repeating
rifle
we
carrying
perhaps
i
could
give
a
scare
anyhow
and
make
haul
off
no
i
would
think
of
it
replied
frank
hastily
you
might
cause
trouble
to
our
own
delicately
balanced
little
aeroplane
by
firing
and
then
again
what
if
you
brought
about
an
accident
and
sent
them
down
to
the
earth
like
so
many
stones
but
you
know
those
other
chaps
banged
away
at
us
and
they
did
bother
their
heads
a
cent
whether
they
upset
our
whole
business
or
not
objected
andy
belligerently
two
wrongs
never
make
a
right
andy
but
when
they
opened
fire
on
us
the
other
went
on
complainingly
that
constituted
a
declaration
of
war
and
so
you
sec
we
be
quite
justified
in
giving
back
the
same
kind
of
medicine
you
forget
that
one
of
those
two
in
the
biplane
is
a
former
schoolmate
of
ours
and
that
perhaps
he
just
being
compelled
to
chase
us
right
now
said
frank
think
so
do
you
growled
andy
above
the
rattle
of
the
exhaust
well
i
like
to
warrant
you
that
puss
carberry
is
grinning
right
now
because
of
the
fright
he
thinks
he
giving
us
no
sir
he
only
too
willing
to
do
anything
to
upset
our
plans
i
know
him
pretty
well
and
i
would
put
any
meanness
past
that
fellow
frank
in
secret
did
begin
to
feel
more
than
anxious
the
afternoon
was
almost
over
and
the
sun
perilously
near
the
western
horizon
too
well
did
he
know
how
rapidly
darkness
came
after
the
disappearance
of
the
king
of
day
he
bade
andy
pay
more
attention
to
the
lay
of
the
country
ahead
of
them
we
keeping
well
ahead
of
the
biplane
he
observed
and
little
danger
of
their
overtaking
us
but
in
case
they
drop
out
of
the
race
we
must
try
and
know
something
of
the
chances
for
a
landing
ourselves
gee
it
looks
pretty
punk
down
there
admitted
andy
after
he
had
carefully
turned
the
glasses
forward
and
down
that
what
is
bothering
me
frank
said
we
sure
got
to
drop
sooner
or
later
because
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
for
us
to
keep
afloat
all
night
and
if
there
happens
to
be
no
opening
in
that
dense
forest
how
can
we
land
listen
as
sure
as
you
live
they
trying
to
wing
us
with
a
shot
cried
andy
well
i
would
bother
about
that
the
fellow
only
has
a
revolver
if
i
know
the
sound
of
one
and
he
could
never
reach
us
at
this
distance
it
tells
me
that
he
got
to
about
the
limit
and
that
something
is
going
to
change
pretty
soon
mark
my
words
andy
of
course
one
of
frank
objects
in
saying
this
was
to
encourage
his
chum
for
he
knew
that
in
all
probability
andy
was
getting
pretty
close
to
what
he
himself
would
call
a
blue
funk
sure
enough
the
reports
continued
until
just
six
had
reached
their
ears
faintly
that
ends
it
observed
frank
complacently
and
he
never
touched
us
echoed
his
cousin
evidently
with
more
or
less
relief
now
take
a
look
back
and
see
what
they
are
doing
andy
h
still
coming
right
along
at
speed
replied
the
other
all
right
there
going
to
be
a
change
soon
look
down
andy
oh
frank
what
a
dandy
open
space
if
only
that
plagued
biplane
was
in
guinea
how
easy
we
could
spiral
down
and
make
a
landing
there
yes
said
frank
and
mark
me
that
is
just
what
they
intend
doing
as
for
us
we
have
to
move
along
further
into
the
wilderness
and
hope
that
another
chance
will
come
to
let
us
out
before
everything
is
blotted
from
sight
by
utter
darkness
frank
they
just
sighted
the
open
spot
cried
andy
a
few
seconds
later
all
right
what
did
i
say
demanded
his
cousin
they
given
up
the
chase
sure
and
are
about
to
drop
down
to
make
a
landing
for
the
night
is
that
so
asked
frank
eagerly
for
their
own
chances
were
getting
poorer
with
every
passing
minute
and
secretly
he
was
more
worried
than
he
chose
to
admit
just
what
they
doing
right
now
beginning
to
spiral
down
puss
and
his
old
biplane
were
in
it
again
with
our
dandy
little
bug
there
they
go
frank
do
i
wish
we
had
as
good
a
place
to
grab
hold
of
the
old
earth
well
frank
continued
gravely
turn
around
and
look
your
prettiest
for
it
then
do
let
even
a
half
way
decent
spot
go
by
any
port
in
a
storm
the
sailor
says
and
that
ought
to
apply
to
the
airship
tar
just
as
well
see
anything
yet
chum
andy
ca
say
that
i
do
came
the
reply
as
the
other
eagerly
bent
his
gaze
on
the
tree
tops
that
they
were
beginning
to
approach
closer
for
frank
had
turned
the
lever
of
the
deflecting
rudder
in
order
to
start
the
monoplane
earthward
and
the
more
they
dropped
the
lower
the
sun
seemed
to
get
until
part
of
his
glowing
disc
appeared
to
touch
the
horizon
already
it
was
growing
dusk
below
them
and
the
dense
foliage
of
the
interlocked
branches
of
the
trees
seemed
to
offer
an
insuperable
barrier
to
a
successful
landing
chapter
xvii
the
camp
in
the
tropical
jungle
frank
this
is
tough
luck
andy
exclaimed
presently
keep
up
your
spirits
old
fellow
called
out
the
other
cheerily
has
the
biplane
succeeded
in
making
a
landing
yet
i
guess
so
replied
andy
moodily
ca
see
any
sign
of
her
back
there
and
besides
it
actually
getting
dark
down
below
even
while
we
can
see
a
bit
of
the
sun
up
here
that
because
of
the
contrast
i
drop
still
lower
so
we
just
clear
the
top
of
the
forest
then
you
wo
need
the
glasses
andy
both
of
us
must
keep
a
clever
lookout
for
a
chance
every
now
and
then
there
happens
to
be
some
opening
in
the
forest
you
know
do
i
hope
we
find
one
though
declared
the
other
oh
it
be
too
mean
for
anything
frank
if
we
smashed
the
precious
little
machine
just
when
we
are
at
the
last
stage
of
our
big
undertaking
if
i
lived
through
it
i
be
broken
hearted
sure
look
then
said
frank
earnestly
and
you
take
the
right
while
i
keep
an
eye
on
the
left
both
of
us
can
watch
out
ahead
if
it
comes
at
all
to
be
of
any
use
it
got
to
be
found
inside
of
the
next
five
minutes
so
soon
as
that
echoed
the
other
in
distressed
tones
oh
afraid
we
in
for
the
very
worst
experience
we
ever
met
up
with
ha
hold
on
andy
what
that
dead
ahead
cried
frank
who
suddenly
decreased
the
speed
of
the
little
motor
it
an
opening
of
some
sort
though
awful
little
ejaculated
andy
we
can
never
do
it
i
afraid
frank
we
just
got
to
no
matter
what
chances
we
take
hold
hard
now
and
if
you
can
jump
out
in
time
help
stop
her
before
we
wreck
her
against
a
tree
even
while
speaking
the
air
pilot
was
starting
to
drop
down
he
had
made
a
specialty
of
this
part
of
the
business
knowing
how
very
important
it
must
always
be
to
aviators
the
rise
was
nothing
compared
to
the
descent
for
many
a
gallant
aircraft
has
been
injured
or
even
wrecked
by
clumsy
manipulation
want
of
room
or
some
other
cause
while
landing
after
a
flight
andy
gripped
hold
of
an
upright
he
tried
to
see
down
into
that
little
slash
in
the
great
forest
as
though
it
might
hold
every
hope
connected
with
his
fortunes
and
the
success
or
failure
of
his
mission
of
mercy
oh
be
careful
frank
he
called
as
they
just
barely
missed
the
top
of
a
great
tree
there
was
no
need
of
saying
this
as
andy
ought
to
have
known
no
one
could
possibly
be
more
careful
than
frank
bird
and
yet
this
was
one
of
those
times
when
daring
had
to
go
hand
in
hand
with
caution
the
space
in
which
they
meant
to
try
for
a
landing
was
so
very
small
that
it
seemed
necessary
for
the
aeroplane
to
come
down
almost
as
lightly
as
a
feather
fortunately
the
youthful
pilot
possessed
a
good
pair
of
eyes
and
the
gloom
had
not
as
yet
entirely
blotted
out
all
features
of
the
landscape
now
that
they
were
so
close
to
the
earth
andy
was
holding
himself
in
readiness
he
knew
that
there
would
perhaps
be
an
opportunity
for
him
to
drop
to
the
ground
and
by
pulling
back
help
to
bring
the
little
airship
to
a
full
stop
before
they
banged
up
against
a
tree
at
the
further
side
of
the
little
glade
never
before
had
andy
found
himself
compelled
to
do
such
a
queer
stunt
as
he
afterwards
termed
it
but
he
was
braced
to
exert
himself
now
to
the
best
of
his
ability
jump
shouted
frank
as
they
came
roughly
in
contact
with
the
ground
and
andy
went
he
never
knew
whether
he
jumped
purposely
or
lost
his
grip
of
that
upright
after
the
shock
of
the
collision
but
the
next
thing
he
realized
he
was
straining
himself
with
might
and
main
to
hold
back
the
monoplane
already
gliding
along
with
sundry
violent
bumps
on
the
three
bicycle
wheels
hurrah
what
did
i
say
cried
frank
as
the
aeroplane
came
to
a
complete
standstill
close
to
the
other
border
of
trees
there
was
a
frightened
series
of
grunts
close
by
and
some
big
unwieldy
animal
went
rushing
away
through
the
dense
undergrowth
crashing
along
as
though
badly
frightened
at
this
queer
thing
that
had
dropped
down
from
the
sky
wow
whatever
was
that
do
you
know
frank
cried
the
one
on
the
ground
i
do
know
for
sure
because
i
only
had
the
least
peep
of
something
that
looked
like
a
small
elephant
making
off
replied
the
other
also
alighting
andy
was
already
reaching
for
the
repeating
rifle
which
had
been
securely
fastened
in
the
frame
of
the
monoplane
but
frank
they
do
have
such
things
as
elephants
down
in
south
america
he
expostulated
sure
they
do
laughed
frank
feeling
particularly
good
over
the
grand
success
that
had
attended
their
perilous
landing
nor
a
rhinocerous
nor
a
hippopotamus
but
they
do
have
the
next
largest
beast
and
that
a
tapir
he
something
like
a
big
pig
and
not
very
dangerous
the
señor
said
that
was
what
we
frightened
off
just
now
i
reckon
well
here
we
are
on
land
again
and
mighty
lucky
to
get
down
without
some
sort
of
a
smash
frank
you
do
think
anything
was
broken
when
we
struck
do
you
of
course
i
ca
say
for
sure
but
i
believe
not
but
all
the
same
i
must
give
a
good
look
in
the
morning
before
we
make
another
start
was
the
reply
frank
returned
and
now
we
just
got
to
stay
here
all
night
remarked
andy
who
still
held
the
gun
in
his
hands
that
is
anything
we
soon
have
a
cheery
blaze
started
that
will
keep
the
prowlers
away
i
guess
get
busy
andy
and
see
what
we
can
do
but
we
start
it
some
distance
away
from
our
gasoline
tank
remember
but
wo
they
be
apt
to
see
a
fire
asked
the
other
as
he
reluctantly
placed
the
rifle
down
and
started
to
gathering
wood
no
easy
task
in
the
increasing
darkness
do
you
mean
puss
and
that
other
fellow
frank
asked
with
a
laugh
oh
they
a
mile
or
two
off
and
even
if
they
could
see
the
biggest
of
fires
i
defy
them
to
get
half
way
here
if
they
took
the
whole
night
to
cut
their
way
through
that
mass
of
trailing
vines
and
brush
do
bother
your
head
about
that
crowd
andy
i
hope
we
done
with
them
for
good
his
reassuring
words
seemed
to
have
considerable
effect
on
his
cousin
who
up
to
recently
had
himself
been
a
most
cheery
fellow
well
he
said
we
sure
got
a
whole
bunch
of
gratitude
on
tap
for
the
lucky
way
we
dropped
in
here
chances
looked
twenty
to
one
it
could
be
done
and
i
like
to
wager
that
no
other
air
pilot
could
have
made
the
ripple
so
well
you
prejudiced
old
fellow
because
i
one
of
the
bird
boys
laughed
frank
as
he
struck
a
match
and
applied
it
to
the
bunch
of
dead
grass
he
had
gathered
in
the
spot
selected
for
their
fire
it
was
a
dozen
yards
away
from
the
aeroplane
and
about
the
same
from
the
nearest
line
of
great
bushy
trees
immediately
the
flame
sprang
up
dispelling
the
darkness
to
some
extent
shucks
but
that
makes
a
big
improvement
and
no
mistake
said
andy
stooping
to
drop
some
wood
on
the
fire
i
always
like
to
see
what
doing
and
more
than
ever
when
i
in
a
strange
place
hark
what
was
that
do
you
suppose
frank
a
sound
had
come
from
the
depths
of
the
forest
not
unlike
the
wailing
of
a
babe
frank
could
give
a
guess
what
made
it
but
he
did
not
immediately
say
so
say
we
must
have
landed
close
to
some
native
shack
and
that
a
baby
crying
andy
declared
hardly
came
from
frank
that
only
one
of
our
cat
friends
giving
tongue
perhaps
calling
to
his
mate
to
come
and
see
the
funny
objects
that
dropped
from
the
skies
wow
reckon
now
you
must
mean
a
yellow
boy
a
jaguar
i
bet
you
frank
there
a
heap
of
around
us
right
now
how
do
we
know
but
what
every
tree
hides
one
of
the
critters
watching
everything
we
do
i
can
tell
you
right
now
that
i
do
wander
far
from
this
jolly
little
blaze
tonight
and
besides
one
of
us
has
just
got
to
keep
a
grip
on
this
gun
all
the
time
i
do
hanker
after
being
carried
away
and
made
a
meal
of
by
a
big
hungry
cat
oh
the
fire
will
scare
them
away
all
right
i
believe
there
is
an
animal
that
does
dread
fire
always
keep
that
in
mind
andy
when
trouble
comes
said
frank
earnestly
i
mean
to
replied
the
other
as
he
once
more
started
to
pick
up
wood
but
it
could
be
noticed
that
while
doing
so
andy
always
kept
on
eye
on
the
alert
as
if
he
really
believed
what
he
had
said
about
the
chances
of
their
being
watched
by
an
army
of
jaguars
there
another
sort
of
cry
frank
he
remarked
presently
yes
and
although
i
could
say
for
sure
i
believe
it
is
made
by
a
colony
of
monkeys
traveling
through
the
woods
at
night
the
other
replied
after
stopping
to
listen
for
a
minute
to
the
odd
sounds
monkeys
cried
andy
smiling
broadly
well
i
declare
i
had
forgotten
that
they
have
them
all
through
the
tropical
regions
around
the
orinoco
the
magdalena
and
the
amazon
and
so
that
a
menagerie
traveling
over
the
treetops
is
it
wish
i
could
just
get
a
look
well
i
do
think
they
far
away
remarked
his
chum
not
for
me
i
know
when
i
well
off
this
camp
looks
good
enough
without
my
wandering
around
in
that
awful
place
let
jabber
and
the
yellow
cats
snarl
but
andy
bird
stays
right
at
his
fireside
tonight
and
i
guess
you
right
said
frank
as
more
noises
arose
all
around
them
chapter
xviii
when
frank
stood
guard
pretty
soon
things
began
to
look
fairly
cheerful
in
that
lonely
glade
situated
in
the
heart
of
the
tropical
forest
a
fine
fire
crackled
and
shot
up
its
red
flames
lighting
up
the
opening
in
which
the
young
aviators
had
so
luckily
alighted
andy
was
bending
over
the
fire
making
a
pot
of
coffee
for
they
had
brought
along
with
them
the
necessary
cooking
utensils
including
a
frying
pan
not
knowing
how
long
they
might
be
adrift
in
the
wilderness
far
from
the
domicile
of
any
human
being
how
do
you
find
it
he
sang
out
for
his
chum
had
been
examining
the
aeroplane
as
well
as
possible
under
the
circumstances
everything
seems
to
be
came
the
reply
i
going
to
start
up
the
engine
now
to
see
if
it
works
without
a
hitch
do
i
hope
so
was
what
andy
said
as
he
paused
in
his
task
to
watch
a
minute
afterward
he
gave
a
little
cheer
as
the
familiar
throbbing
sound
was
heard
making
the
sweetest
music
that
ever
greeted
the
listening
ear
of
an
aviator
that
sounds
good
to
me
frank
he
cried
nothing
wrong
about
it
thank
goodness
came
the
reply
of
the
other
as
he
again
shut
off
power
because
they
could
not
afford
to
waste
a
drop
of
their
valuable
supply
of
gasoline
well
suppose
you
drop
in
here
and
sample
this
brand
of
coffee
what
with
the
cold
snack
we
brought
and
which
still
holds
out
we
ought
to
get
along
right
decently
frank
i
tell
you
right
now
replied
the
other
as
he
came
up
i
hungry
enough
to
eat
anything
going
yes
even
some
of
our
native
cook
worst
messes
and
that
coffee
just
seems
to
make
me
wild
shove
a
cup
over
this
way
as
quick
as
you
know
how
brother
yum
yum
that
goes
straight
to
the
spot
and
this
cheese
and
crackers
is
half
way
bad
even
if
it
is
pilot
biscuit
well
said
andy
ai
you
a
pilot
all
right
and
do
they
feed
sailors
on
this
hard
tack
generally
sure
we
got
no
kick
coming
everything
is
to
the
mustard
and
if
you
asked
me
my
opinion
right
now
i
say
things
are
coming
our
way
listen
to
that
chorus
would
you
remarked
frank
as
various
sounds
arose
all
through
the
dense
timber
around
them
they
seem
to
be
heading
this
way
sure
enough
at
that
andy
reached
again
for
the
gun
on
which
he
seemed
to
depend
so
much
well
if
any
of
take
a
sneaking
notion
to
look
in
on
us
why
meaning
to
use
up
a
few
of
these
cartridges
in
this
magazine
he
remarked
sturdily
as
he
glanced
cautiously
around
no
fear
of
that
now
said
his
chum
reassuringly
the
danger
will
come
if
it
does
at
all
later
on
when
we
have
more
trouble
keeping
the
fire
going
so
after
we
get
this
supper
down
we
shall
have
to
gather
fuel
it
may
not
be
quite
so
nice
to
go
after
it
when
we
see
a
line
of
yellow
eyes
watching
all
around
oh
shucks
you
just
stringing
me
now
frank
if
i
really
thought
they
be
as
bold
as
that
why
i
climb
a
tree
that
what
what
good
would
that
do
tell
me
jeered
the
other
why
these
cats
just
live
in
trees
and
can
leap
twenty
feet
if
they
can
one
perhaps
if
you
found
a
hollow
tree
now
you
might
feel
safe
but
in
the
branches
of
one
never
why
the
monkeys
would
come
and
laugh
at
you
the
ground
is
the
best
place
for
us
after
all
andy
more
coffee
in
the
pot
if
you
ai
afraid
of
staying
awake
suggested
the
cook
that
would
just
suit
me
for
you
see
i
more
afraid
of
going
to
sleep
than
anything
else
while
on
guard
duty
frank
remarked
soberly
by
degrees
andy
realized
that
this
business
of
camping
in
the
heart
of
a
tropical
forest
was
no
laughing
matter
still
they
had
escaped
so
many
threatening
perils
that
he
was
beginning
to
believe
they
must
be
under
the
protecting
wing
of
some
favoring
god
and
that
success
lay
just
ahead
they
sat
up
and
talked
for
a
long
time
neither
would
admit
being
at
all
sleepy
and
yet
frank
caught
his
chum
yawning
ever
so
many
times
here
you
just
make
up
your
mind
to
turn
in
and
get
seven
winks
he
said
pretending
to
be
giving
orders
with
all
the
airs
of
a
commanding
officer
i
suppose
i
just
have
to
came
the
reply
as
the
other
started
to
roll
up
close
to
the
fire
for
they
had
no
blankets
with
them
this
time
do
you
know
i
was
just
thinking
about
puss
well
what
of
him
asked
frank
what
if
they
start
to
chase
us
again
in
the
morning
are
we
going
to
put
up
with
that
funny
business
right
along
i
say
no
let
warn
that
we
armed
and
can
bore
a
hole
right
through
their
jolly
old
biplane
upsetting
them
any
time
they
get
close
enough
i
drawing
the
line
on
tomorrow
because
somehow
i
feel
it
in
here
that
it
going
to
be
the
greatest
day
of
my
life
and
andy
laid
his
hand
on
his
heart
as
he
spoke
yes
that
would
be
our
best
plan
admitted
frank
we
already
stood
quite
enough
of
that
funny
business
as
you
call
it
they
even
fired
at
us
depend
on
it
andy
they
wo
follow
us
very
far
next
time
and
andy
seeing
the
way
his
chum
mouth
was
firmly
set
made
up
his
mind
that
frank
had
reached
the
end
of
his
patience
contented
with
the
prospects
for
the
morrow
he
therefore
lay
down
to
get
some
sleep
i
say
frank
he
called
out
presently
well
what
now
asked
the
one
on
guard
who
had
possession
of
the
rifle
and
had
taken
up
his
position
so
that
he
could
have
a
clear
view
of
the
open
space
all
about
the
camp
if
one
of
the
prowlers
tries
to
drag
me
off
remember
i
got
my
leg
tied
to
this
stake
i
knocked
into
the
ground
while
he
tugging
you
can
have
a
bully
good
chance
to
knock
him
over
see
all
right
grinned
frank
i
remember
but
let
out
a
whoop
if
you
feel
yourself
going
i
might
be
looking
the
other
way
you
just
bet
i
will
mumbled
andy
curling
himself
up
as
near
the
fire
as
he
dared
creep
and
in
three
minutes
frank
knew
from
the
heavy
breathing
coming
from
that
quarter
that
his
chum
had
found
no
trouble
in
getting
to
sleep
regardless
of
the
various
sounds
welling
up
from
the
neighboring
forest
and
the
fears
that
possessed
his
boyish
soul
frank
sometimes
sat
down
and
again
feeling
cramped
in
this
position
he
would
rise
to
his
feet
and
walk
back
and
forth
but
all
the
time
he
kept
the
gun
in
his
possession
with
the
hammer
pulled
back
ready
for
business
and
constantly
did
he
maintain
a
close
watch
along
the
nearer
border
of
the
undergrowth
that
lay
there
so
dense
and
filled
with
mystery
time
passed
on
it
seemed
as
though
a
thousand
things
flitted
through
the
active
mind
of
the
young
aviator
as
he
thus
stood
guard
over
the
camp
once
again
he
was
back
in
good
old
bloomsbury
where
he
had
spent
so
many
happy
days
he
could
see
the
faces
of
his
boyhood
friends
larry
elephant
and
others
frequently
he
would
detect
a
movement
here
or
there
among
the
trees
and
at
such
times
he
could
easily
imagine
that
some
animal
belonging
to
the
forest
was
creeping
closer
in
the
question
was
whether
simple
curiosity
urged
them
to
do
this
thing
or
a
design
upon
the
occupants
of
the
camp
frank
had
been
in
other
situations
calling
for
considerable
pluck
and
never
failed
to
meet
the
emergency
nor
did
he
now
it
must
have
been
some
three
hours
back
that
andy
lay
down
to
sleep
that
had
been
the
limit
of
time
arranged
upon
but
frank
did
not
show
any
signs
of
intending
to
awaken
the
other
let
him
sleep
he
said
to
himself
as
he
walked
up
and
down
for
by
now
he
was
beginning
to
feel
very
drowsy
himself
in
spite
of
the
coffee
he
needs
it
more
than
i
do
and
besides
i
a
little
dubious
as
to
what
sort
of
watch
andy
would
keep
anyhow
i
can
stand
it
a
while
longer
hello
what
that
mean
his
attention
had
been
attracted
toward
a
movement
in
the
brush
at
the
nearest
point
of
the
forest
it
was
not
thirty
feet
distant
could
one
of
those
muscular
jaguars
cover
that
distance
in
a
wild
leap
what
if
without
warning
he
should
see
a
tawny
figure
flashing
through
the
air
and
headed
straight
for
him
frank
threw
the
gun
up
to
his
shoulder
as
if
to
try
and
see
how
readily
he
could
cover
such
a
flying
form
as
he
did
so
he
heard
a
low
and
ominous
growl
which
undoubtedly
sprang
from
the
very
spot
where
he
had
just
caught
that
suspicious
movement
he
bent
his
head
to
look
closer
and
as
he
did
so
an
exclamation
fell
from
his
lips
and
that
no
owl
staring
at
me
either
he
said
to
himself
as
he
caught
the
singular
glow
of
what
seemed
like
two
balls
of
fire
just
under
the
lower
growth
frank
knew
what
they
undoubtedly
must
be
he
had
seen
the
orbs
of
a
cat
shine
in
this
phosphorescent
way
in
the
darkness
there
could
be
no
doubt
but
that
he
was
being
surveyed
by
one
of
those
savage
beasts
whose
whining
he
and
andy
had
heard
around
the
camp
for
hours
and
i
declare
if
that
purring
sound
does
come
from
there
too
he
muttered
as
he
sank
down
upon
one
knee
the
better
to
aim
his
rifle
what
was
that
the
old
señor
was
telling
me
about
these
beasts
did
he
say
they
jerked
their
tail
to
and
fro
like
a
pendulum
and
made
a
queer
noise
just
before
they
jumped
if
that
is
so
then
this
fellow
is
getting
ready
to
leap
over
right
now
time
i
was
doing
something
if
i
do
want
him
to
drop
on
my
chum
like
a
rubber
ball
well
here
goes
to
take
him
between
those
yellow
eyes
steady
now
my
boy
steady
chapter
xix
firebrands
and
jaguars
bang
wow
are
they
coming
in
on
us
shouted
andy
suddenly
aroused
by
the
sharp
report
of
the
repeating
rifle
he
bounded
to
his
feet
and
from
his
manner
of
action
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
he
remembered
exactly
the
condition
of
affairs
at
the
time
of
his
taking
passage
for
the
land
of
dreams
frank
had
aimed
straight
between
those
glowing
eyes
at
the
time
he
fired
and
as
he
was
perfectly
calm
at
the
time
it
stood
to
reason
that
his
bullet
went
direct
to
the
mark
he
meant
it
should
he
saw
a
yellow
object
threshing
about
under
the
dense
growth
and
realized
that
he
had
given
the
adventurous
jaguar
something
that
was
apt
to
wind
up
his
career
as
a
terror
to
the
monkey
hosts
of
the
forest
but
this
was
not
all
frank
saw
another
figure
had
appeared
just
ten
paces
farther
along
and
he
realized
that
a
second
jaguar
had
crept
out
of
the
copse
evidently
bent
on
charging
the
camp
there
two
more
frank
oh
my
it
a
dozen
i
guess
whooped
andy
who
had
found
a
better
opportunity
to
see
in
other
quarters
grab
a
firebrand
quick
shouted
frank
trying
to
get
a
bead
on
the
second
slinking
figure
and
yet
hesitating
about
firing
because
of
the
great
risk
that
must
ensue
should
he
only
wound
the
fierce
monster
he
saw
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
that
andy
made
a
plunge
toward
the
fire
and
was
snatching
a
brand
out
in
each
hand
wave
them
around
your
head
and
shout
like
thunder
he
cried
at
the
same
time
starting
in
to
do
this
latter
himself
perhaps
it
was
a
comical
thing
in
some
respects
andy
often
laughed
over
it
afterwards
but
just
then
it
seemed
serious
enough
the
way
both
of
them
let
loose
with
their
strong
young
voices
would
have
made
a
football
cheer
captain
turn
green
with
envy
they
fairly
awoke
the
echoes
slumbering
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
and
andy
waved
those
two
torches
like
a
good
fellow
back
and
forth
in
and
out
weaving
them
as
an
expert
indian
club
athlete
might
do
with
his
heavy
weights
until
the
rushing
flames
roared
again
and
again
because
of
their
rapid
passage
through
the
air
they
licked
already
frank
whooped
andy
as
he
daringly
began
to
advance
with
his
flaming
beacons
swinging
around
and
around
look
at
the
coward
moving
back
would
you
talk
to
me
about
your
guns
they
ai
in
it
with
these
things
when
it
comes
to
scaring
off
a
pack
of
wild
beasts
scat
you
terror
or
i
just
swat
you
one
alongside
your
jaw
growl
at
me
will
you
there
take
that
hang
you
to
the
astonishment
of
frank
andy
who
had
rushed
straight
at
one
of
the
retreating
animals
suddenly
hurled
a
blazing
brand
straight
at
the
jaguar
in
his
palmy
baseball
days
andy
had
never
amounted
to
a
great
deal
as
a
pitcher
but
all
the
same
he
made
a
beautiful
throw
right
then
and
there
the
whirling
blazing
fagot
of
wood
struck
the
slinking
beast
full
in
the
side
frank
threw
up
his
gun
ready
to
shoot
should
the
jaguar
as
he
feared
might
be
the
case
leap
at
his
chum
but
there
proved
to
be
no
need
instead
the
brute
was
evidently
alarmed
at
this
novel
weapon
something
entirely
beyond
his
ken
frank
heard
him
give
a
snarl
that
told
of
mingled
rage
and
fright
then
he
made
a
spring
but
from
the
fire
and
into
the
dense
undergrowth
from
whence
he
had
just
issued
so
bravely
looking
around
frank
saw
that
the
glade
was
deserted
of
foes
the
whirling
torches
had
done
the
work
bully
for
us
shouted
the
excited
andy
ready
to
dance
in
his
delight
over
the
success
of
his
labors
did
we
send
a
flying
though
perhaps
they
just
dare
to
come
snoopin
around
here
again
when
not
asked
frank
i
guess
you
nailed
that
critter
all
right
dast
we
look
and
see
sure
we
will
returned
frank
instantly
pick
up
another
bit
of
burning
wood
then
let
me
go
just
ahead
of
you
so
that
i
can
shoot
if
i
have
to
they
thus
boldly
advanced
toward
the
spot
where
frank
had
first
sighted
the
blazing
yellow
orbs
i
can
see
something
there
declared
andy
who
possessed
sharp
eyes
yes
it
the
beast
all
right
but
i
ca
say
for
sure
whether
down
on
his
back
or
crouching
for
a
spring
careful
not
so
fast
andy
and
frank
kept
covering
the
object
with
his
rifle
as
foot
by
foot
they
kept
on
he
lying
on
his
side
he
a
dead
duck
all
right
sang
out
andy
waving
his
fire
vigorously
to
and
fro
you
right
he
stone
dead
observed
the
other
a
touch
of
natural
pride
in
his
voice
for
it
was
no
mean
feat
to
kill
so
ferocious
a
beast
as
a
jaguar
after
seeing
only
his
two
eyes
shining
in
the
darkness
beyond
the
frank
stooped
down
and
catching
hold
of
one
of
the
dead
animal
hind
legs
started
dragging
it
toward
the
fire
hold
on
there
said
andy
do
tell
me
we
going
to
have
a
steak
off
that
old
cat
i
can
stand
for
a
good
deal
but
i
go
hungry
a
long
time
before
i
eat
any
of
do
worry
about
that
laughed
frank
but
think
what
a
bully
old
rug
his
hide
will
make
some
day
i
going
to
try
and
take
it
off
if
i
can
while
you
getting
breakfast
in
the
morning
it
worth
while
andy
looked
as
though
he
doubted
the
ability
of
his
chum
to
accomplish
the
feat
but
then
he
was
counting
without
his
host
for
when
the
chance
came
frank
deftly
removed
the
pelt
and
kept
it
for
a
reminder
of
his
hazardous
shot
andy
insisted
on
taking
his
turn
at
playing
guard
when
he
found
out
what
time
it
was
first
of
all
frank
saw
that
the
fire
was
revived
with
plenty
of
fuel
handy
then
after
giving
his
chum
a
few
last
instructions
he
consented
to
lie
down
but
his
sleep
could
not
have
been
very
sound
for
frequently
he
would
raise
his
head
and
take
a
look
around
seeing
nothing
suspicious
he
would
again
lie
down
so
the
night
passed
away
frank
was
on
deck
an
hour
and
more
before
the
dawn
came
he
felt
too
anxious
concerning
the
possibilities
of
the
coming
day
to
sleep
much
so
andy
started
to
get
breakfast
such
as
it
was
before
the
night
had
really
gone
he
excused
himself
by
saying
that
while
he
was
not
at
all
hungry
the
operation
had
to
be
gone
through
with
and
the
sooner
he
was
at
it
the
quicker
they
might
be
free
to
mount
upward
frank
knew
what
a
terrific
load
was
on
his
chum
mind
and
how
he
thrilled
with
suspense
now
that
they
were
so
near
the
realization
of
his
highest
hopes
or
worst
fears
and
so
he
too
set
to
work
to
remove
the
jaguar
skin
for
it
would
make
a
pretty
decent
rug
if
it
could
be
properly
preserved
morning
was
just
breaking
as
they
sat
down
to
partake
of
the
simple
meal
neither
of
them
seemed
to
care
for
much
it
was
indeed
no
time
for
feasting
or
making
merry
when
the
day
had
probably
dawned
that
was
to
settle
their
mission
one
way
or
the
other
one
thing
good
remarked
andy
hopefully
there
does
seem
to
be
any
strong
wind
blowing
this
morning
frank
had
been
studying
the
lay
of
the
land
in
the
glade
i
tell
you
we
going
to
have
all
we
can
do
to
squeeze
up
out
of
here
without
scraping
against
any
tree
before
we
can
rise
above
them
he
observed
presently
but
do
you
think
we
can
do
it
demanded
his
chum
anxiously
watching
his
expressive
face
i
think
it
is
possible
came
the
slow
reply
which
after
all
gave
andy
new
cause
for
distrust
since
his
cousin
was
so
cautious
a
fellow
that
he
seldom
if
ever
gushed
over
anything
at
the
same
time
he
never
expressed
doubts
when
he
felt
positive
but
cried
andy
there
no
other
way
to
fly
we
could
take
the
aeroplane
to
another
place
and
i
reckon
there
is
a
cleared
field
within
ten
miles
of
here
no
it
must
be
done
right
where
we
are
now
i
going
to
measure
the
opening
to
find
out
its
widest
dimensions
then
we
will
take
the
monoplane
as
far
back
as
we
can
and
make
all
arrangements
for
a
rapid
start
but
to
rise
above
those
trees
even
the
shortest
of
them
is
going
to
call
for
considerable
management
and
some
great
good
luck
in
the
bargain
but
frank
you
done
it
before
declared
andy
you
know
you
made
lots
of
short
starts
that
beat
all
the
records
that
your
best
hold
and
frank
we
just
got
to
get
out
of
here
everything
depends
on
it
sure
responded
frank
cheerily
enough
and
we
manage
somehow
never
fear
now
to
foot
off
the
space
count
to
yourself
and
compare
notes
when
i
get
to
the
other
side
this
looks
the
widest
range
according
to
my
eye
so
they
both
started
off
frank
placing
one
foot
close
in
front
of
the
other
and
andy
keeping
alongside
in
order
to
do
his
own
counting
in
this
way
they
passed
from
one
side
of
the
glade
to
the
other
and
frank
was
secretly
pleased
to
find
that
the
distance
was
considerably
more
than
he
had
judged
possible
besides
the
trees
happened
to
be
much
lower
on
this
side
which
fact
would
be
of
considerable
benefit
to
them
when
they
started
to
make
the
run
and
rise
frank
was
still
muttering
the
number
of
feet
to
himself
and
had
arrived
within
something
like
five
yards
of
the
nearest
trees
when
without
the
slightest
warning
he
heard
andy
let
out
a
screech
that
could
have
but
one
meaning
he
had
surely
sighted
something
that
spelled
peril
to
one
or
both
of
the
bird
boys
frank
had
wisely
kept
the
rifle
in
his
hand
and
instinct
caused
him
to
throw
this
up
to
his
shoulder
though
as
yet
he
had
not
the
slightest
suspicion
as
to
what
the
nature
of
the
danger
might
be
nor
the
quarter
in
which
it
lay
chapter
xx
the
aeroplane
boys
once
more
afloat
frank
oh
frank
more
than
a
few
times
had
it
fallen
to
frank
bird
to
drag
his
cousin
and
chum
andy
back
from
some
impending
danger
now
the
shoe
seemed
to
be
on
the
other
foot
even
as
he
looked
hastily
up
startled
by
these
sudden
cries
frank
felt
his
arm
seized
in
a
frenzied
clutch
and
himself
jerked
backward
what
is
it
andy
here
hold
on
let
my
arm
free
and
tell
me
he
exclaimed
look
there
and
you
were
going
to
walk
right
up
against
it
oh
frank
what
a
horrible
monster
andy
replied
in
trembling
tones
as
he
strove
to
point
toward
something
that
he
had
seen
just
in
the
nick
of
time
whew
i
should
say
you
were
right
ai
he
a
dandy
though
and
if
i
saw
him
at
all
i
thought
it
was
a
great
big
vine
hanging
from
that
tree
ugh
look
at
him
stretch
his
mouth
would
you
andy
thanks
to
your
sharp
eyes
i
here
instead
of
in
his
slimy
folds
i
guess
he
could
crush
an
ox
they
say
nothing
can
stand
the
pressure
once
they
get
a
couple
of
folds
around
is
it
a
python
gasped
andy
his
horrified
eyes
glued
on
the
spectacle
of
the
slightly
swaying
ten
feet
of
snake
that
hung
from
the
limb
of
a
great
tree
in
part
as
thick
as
frank
thigh
about
the
same
thing
replied
frank
down
here
they
call
them
anacondas
and
in
other
parts
of
the
world
they
i
guess
the
whole
bunch
belongs
to
the
same
family
of
squeezers
but
that
fellow
is
in
our
way
well
yes
if
you
still
determined
to
run
the
aeroplane
across
lots
toward
this
side
of
the
opening
andy
remarked
with
a
shudder
why
perhaps
that
old
chap
might
get
gay
and
grab
hold
just
when
we
expected
to
go
sailing
off
that
would
be
a
calamity
not
only
for
him
but
the
bird
boys
in
the
bargain
all
right
then
he
got
to
get
his
frank
observed
what
are
you
going
to
do
demanded
the
other
nervously
take
a
crack
at
his
head
came
the
reply
once
let
a
bullet
from
this
little
marlin
hard
shooter
smack
him
on
the
coco
and
there
be
a
funeral
in
the
anaconda
family
but
for
goodness
sake
make
sure
work
of
it
frank
what
if
you
just
wounded
the
monster
he
come
whirling
along
at
us
like
a
hurricane
and
i
sure
he
must
be
thirty
feet
long
if
he
a
dozen
look
at
the
thickness
of
his
neck
would
you
be
mighty
careful
for
his
head
swinging
a
bit
you
notice
that
was
what
made
me
get
sight
of
him
say
frank
well
hurry
up
he
may
take
a
notion
to
move
off
and
i
lose
my
chance
andy
how
it
do
for
me
to
get
some
fire
and
shoo
him
away
suggested
his
cousin
do
know
how
it
would
work
replied
frank
smiling
a
little
however
at
the
faith
andy
seemed
to
have
in
a
blazing
brand
now
that
he
could
look
back
to
his
late
experience
with
the
jaguar
never
heard
that
snakes
were
afraid
of
fire
and
besides
there
no
need
now
keep
quiet
and
watch
you
see
something
worth
while
but
be
ready
to
jump
clear
he
had
already
dropped
down
on
one
knee
the
marlin
stock
rested
against
his
cheek
and
his
eyes
sighted
along
the
barrel
andy
fairly
held
his
breath
his
startled
eyes
glued
on
that
swaying
head
of
the
monster
then
came
the
sharp
report
as
frank
pulled
the
trigger
he
instantly
jumped
back
and
by
a
rapid
motion
of
his
hand
sent
another
cartridge
into
the
chamber
the
clever
mechanism
of
the
gun
proving
that
it
was
built
so
as
never
to
fail
in
an
emergency
andy
had
accompanied
his
chum
in
that
backward
movement
but
never
for
an
instant
did
he
remove
his
eyes
from
the
strange
spectacle
that
was
taking
place
there
in
front
of
them
both
undoubtedly
the
well
aimed
bullet
had
crashed
through
the
fearful
head
of
the
suspended
anaconda
instantly
it
released
its
many
coils
above
and
a
tremendous
length
of
writhing
snake
could
be
seen
whipping
over
the
ground
nothing
in
the
way
of
small
vegetation
could
stand
in
the
path
of
those
powerful
springy
coils
as
they
shot
this
way
and
that
oh
my
gasped
the
astounded
andy
as
he
moved
farther
back
so
as
to
avoid
any
chance
contact
with
the
flying
destructive
force
that
was
leveling
everything
in
the
glade
for
twenty
feet
around
did
you
ever
see
anything
to
equal
that
talk
to
me
about
your
harvesting
machines
here
one
that
got
all
beat
to
a
frazzle
ai
he
ever
going
to
give
up
the
ghost
frank
guess
these
anacondas
must
have
the
nine
lives
of
a
cat
well
remarked
frank
you
must
have
forgotten
that
among
boys
said
that
a
snake
wo
die
till
sundown
i
seen
one
tail
wiggle
hours
after
we
thought
the
thing
was
stone
dead
there
he
moving
off
into
the
forest
and
a
good
riddance
while
i
like
to
measure
the
serpent
just
from
curiosity
we
got
no
time
to
waste
waiting
for
him
to
kick
the
bucket
that
right
assented
andy
and
as
for
going
anywhere
near
such
a
whirlwind
you
have
to
excuse
me
they
watched
the
dying
anaconda
gradually
vanish
in
the
depth
of
the
forest
and
both
boys
were
glad
that
it
had
turned
out
that
way
since
they
were
anxious
to
depart
from
the
place
do
i
wish
i
had
my
little
camera
along
so
i
could
have
snapped
a
shot
at
that
dandy
chap
the
fellows
would
believe
me
then
when
i
told
about
what
happened
to
us
here
and
anyway
frank
i
do
think
forget
this
camp
do
you
well
hardly
replied
his
chum
smiling
broadly
because
we
sure
had
enough
happen
to
us
here
to
make
us
remember
but
i
glad
to
find
there
going
to
be
more
space
for
the
run
than
i
thought
at
first
we
need
every
inch
of
it
declared
andy
as
he
looked
dubiously
at
the
tops
of
the
lower
trees
about
the
place
where
the
snake
had
held
forth
do
i
wish
we
brought
a
few
sticks
of
dynamite
along
though
for
goodness
sake
what
would
we
want
with
dynamite
think
you
could
have
blown
up
that
snake
do
you
asked
frank
as
they
started
to
cross
the
glade
toward
the
waiting
monoplane
oh
shucks
no
i
was
thinking
how
we
could
plant
under
a
bunch
of
those
trees
and
enlarge
the
gap
declared
andy
at
that
frank
burst
out
into
a
hearty
laugh
what
a
fellow
you
are
for
wild
notions
think
of
us
blowing
up
the
forest
to
make
an
aviation
field
i
reckon
however
seeing
that
you
have
got
the
dynamite
andy
we
have
to
do
the
best
we
can
take
hold
here
and
we
push
the
machine
just
as
far
back
as
it
will
go
perhaps
we
can
gain
a
few
yards
at
this
end
that
will
count
in
the
long
run
frank
was
particularly
careful
about
every
little
detail
he
knew
just
what
he
had
to
depend
on
in
the
past
he
had
made
it
a
pet
hobby
to
rise
in
as
short
a
space
as
possible
and
now
this
faculty
seemed
destined
to
prove
a
valuable
asset
in
their
speedy
climbing
up
all
ready
he
asked
grimly
andy
took
one
last
look
at
the
face
of
his
chum
he
saw
that
mouth
was
compressed
in
that
firm
way
that
stood
for
so
much
and
somehow
andy
wavering
confidence
returned
in
full
measure
when
frank
bird
looked
like
that
things
always
had
gone
according
to
his
will
and
they
must
now
yes
i
fit
frank
he
said
quietly
let
her
go
when
you
ready
in
the
many
times
that
the
two
boys
had
made
ascents
andy
could
never
remember
that
his
pulses
throbbed
with
the
suspense
they
did
now
not
even
on
that
never
to
be
forgotten
initial
performance
when
for
the
first
time
they
felt
the
strange
sensation
of
leaving
the
solid
ground
in
a
flying
machine
had
he
been
so
excited
so
nervous
so
filled
with
alternate
hope
and
fear
frank
had
taken
every
possible
precaution
he
had
thoroughly
studied
the
ground
and
made
sure
that
no
obstacle
would
be
apt
to
cause
the
running
gear
of
the
aeroplane
to
swerve
and
thus
throw
them
off
their
course
all
he
could
do
was
to
start
the
machinery
get
a
rise
at
the
quickest
possible
second
and
be
ready
to
shut
off
power
if
he
realized
that
the
feat
they
were
about
to
attempt
were
impossible
so
as
to
avoid
smashing
the
planes
against
a
tree
then
here
goes
he
said
calmly
andy
held
his
breath
as
he
heard
the
engine
start
off
at
a
tremendous
speed
he
felt
as
though
a
giant
hand
had
plucked
them
from
the
spot
where
the
aeroplane
had
been
planted
for
the
start
across
the
glade
they
went
speeding
his
heart
almost
jumped
into
his
mouth
he
believed
as
he
felt
the
little
craft
start
to
leave
the
ground
as
frank
manipulated
the
planes
and
elevated
them
so
as
to
catch
the
air
under
the
broad
blades
they
were
rising
rapidly
now
would
they
manage
to
clear
those
terrible
treetops
that
stood
like
a
grim
barrier
in
their
path
higher
yet
did
frank
throw
the
planes
so
that
they
actually
seemed
to
be
climbing
straight
upward
according
to
the
vivid
imagination
of
andy
who
clutching
the
upright
at
his
side
waited
for
what
was
going
to
happen
it
was
too
late
now
to
retreat
they
had
gone
too
far
to
stop
and
try
again
no
matter
whether
for
good
or
ill
their
kite
had
been
tossed
to
the
winds
of
heaven
and
they
must
abide
by
the
consequences
andy
gave
one
little
squeal
for
it
could
not
be
termed
anything
else
under
the
sun
this
was
when
they
shot
past
the
most
prominent
branch
of
the
tree
that
happened
to
stand
directly
in
the
way
of
the
rising
aeroplane
andy
believed
that
the
wheels
below
must
have
actually
brushed
through
the
foliage
for
he
always
declared
that
he
heard
a
fierce
swish
as
they
passed
had
they
caught
even
one
little
bit
something
dreadful
might
have
happened
and
the
precious
aeroplane
on
which
everything
depended
meet
its
sad
fate
not
to
speak
of
the
nasty
fall
the
bird
boys
would
have
suffered
but
fortune
was
once
more
kind
to
the
young
adventurers
they
passed
safely
through
the
peril
and
were
speedily
fully
launched
upon
the
wide
open
expanse
of
space
hurrah
shouted
the
exultant
andy
but
it
might
be
noticed
that
his
voice
was
a
bit
husky
even
as
his
face
seemed
chalky
white
a
close
shave
remarked
frank
who
himself
had
been
rigid
while
they
were
thus
taking
such
desperate
chances
but
we
made
it
thank
goodness
i
hope
that
will
be
a
lucky
token
of
what
the
day
has
in
store
for
us
amen
echoed
his
chum
and
there
was
no
levity
in
his
tones
either
the
sun
was
just
rising
below
them
lay
the
dense
foliage
of
the
almost
impenetrable
forests
from
which
they
had
just
made
this
almost
miraculous
escape
and
both
young
aviators
as
if
by
common
consent
started
to
sweep
the
horizon
around
with
their
eyes
see
anything
of
it
asked
andy
eagerly
i
thought
i
did
away
over
yonder
toward
the
mountains
but
i
guess
it
must
be
a
big
bird
hovering
high
up
a
condor
perhaps
frank
replied
well
there
is
any
sign
of
the
biplane
that
sure
andy
went
on
in
a
relieved
voice
perhaps
they
did
have
as
good
luck
in
landing
as
we
did
and
had
a
nasty
spill
do
i
hope
they
busted
some
of
the
planes
or
part
of
the
little
old
gnome
engine
so
we
wo
have
to
be
bothered
with
again
frank
made
no
remark
while
as
a
rule
he
refused
to
let
anything
like
bitterness
dwell
in
his
heart
still
this
was
a
case
where
everything
was
at
stake
and
if
the
bothersome
revolutionists
kept
chasing
them
in
the
biplane
they
were
apt
to
give
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
secretly
he
could
echo
andy
wish
that
the
biplane
might
be
temporarily
crippled
so
as
to
be
unfit
for
flying
now
what
the
programme
asked
andy
when
they
had
covered
several
miles
we
just
got
to
head
for
the
mountains
yonder
replied
his
chum
you
know
he
declared
it
was
a
valley
that
lay
among
the
mountains
and
it
must
be
to
be
surrounded
by
high
cliffs
once
we
get
among
the
hills
we
sail
back
and
forth
combing
the
whole
region
and
hoping
sooner
or
later
to
discover
his
queer
prison
andy
lapsed
into
a
state
of
silence
but
he
kept
watching
ahead
as
they
drew
gradually
nearer
the
uplifts
doubtless
but
one
thought
held
dominion
in
his
mind
and
this
was
that
somewhere
amidst
those
same
mountains
the
father
whom
he
loved
so
dearly
was
waiting
and
hoping
for
an
answer
to
his
appeals
for
aid
chapter
xxi
the
last
little
hot
air
balloon
did
you
ever
see
a
wilder
region
asked
frank
about
the
middle
of
the
morning
when
they
had
alighted
on
a
broad
level
plateau
so
as
to
allow
him
to
look
over
some
little
matters
connected
with
the
engine
that
he
believed
needed
attention
andy
had
been
using
the
binoculars
pretty
much
all
the
time
they
were
aloft
but
without
any
success
many
times
be
began
to
think
he
had
sighted
something
that
looked
like
cliffs
rising
up
and
a
wild
hope
had
seized
upon
his
devoted
heart
but
upon
frank
bringing
the
airship
in
that
quarter
in
answer
to
his
frantic
appeals
it
had
proven
to
be
a
false
clue
cliffs
they
saw
in
plenty
but
as
yet
none
enclosing
a
valley
so
as
to
imprison
an
unfortunate
aeronaut
whose
runaway
balloon
had
dropped
with
him
into
its
depths
still
the
day
was
not
nearly
half
over
and
the
monoplane
behaved
splendidly
so
that
they
could
hope
to
continue
the
search
as
long
as
their
supply
of
gasolene
held
out
i
never
give
up
hunting
andy
declared
as
he
stood
there
watching
his
chum
potter
with
the
engine
and
examine
things
in
general
no
not
as
long
as
this
fine
little
machine
stands
by
us
we
can
get
more
gasoline
if
necessary
for
we
brought
a
good
supply
aboard
the
boat
when
we
gone
as
far
as
we
dare
down
this
way
we
make
another
start
further
on
i
with
you
chum
andy
and
you
do
need
to
be
told
that
observed
frank
quietly
while
he
worked
on
as
if
i
did
know
that
and
counted
on
you
through
thick
and
thin
declared
the
other
with
a
look
of
sincere
affection
well
now
we
ready
to
go
up
again
remarked
frank
and
there
no
use
asking
if
you
feel
like
it
so
pile
in
and
we
make
a
flying
start
from
the
top
of
this
rocky
plateau
what
a
difference
from
our
last
start
observed
andy
with
satisfaction
for
they
were
on
an
elevation
with
a
valley
far
below
and
the
air
was
decidedly
bracing
for
the
tropics
i
should
say
it
was
laughed
frank
do
you
know
what
it
puts
me
in
mind
of
i
bet
you
just
thinking
of
when
we
won
that
race
to
the
summit
of
old
thunder
top
where
nobody
had
ever
been
able
to
climb
before
and
how
we
had
to
make
our
start
for
home
from
that
little
plateau
plunging
off
into
space
just
what
i
was
declared
frank
but
here
we
have
a
longer
swing
and
it
going
to
be
a
snap
of
a
launch
compared
with
some
we
remember
ugh
grunted
andy
will
i
ever
forget
the
one
this
morning
but
let
loose
my
boy
i
had
just
sighted
a
likely
looking
place
away
over
yonder
at
the
time
you
said
we
ought
to
take
advantage
of
this
fine
landing
stage
to
look
things
over
just
head
her
that
way
when
we
get
going
will
you
sure
anything
to
oblige
assented
the
other
the
launch
was
just
as
easy
as
they
had
anticipated
indeed
frank
seemed
to
have
gotten
this
part
of
the
programme
down
to
a
fine
point
and
could
accomplish
it
apparently
as
well
as
a
wright
or
a
curtiss
ten
minutes
later
and
the
monoplane
was
soaring
toward
the
region
which
andy
had
denominated
as
a
likely
spot
look
at
that
big
bird
watching
us
from
that
pinnacle
yonder
exclaimed
andy
as
he
lowered
the
glasses
for
a
moment
i
see
him
replied
his
comrade
and
there
no
doubt
now
but
what
that
is
a
condor
of
the
andes
he
thinks
we
must
be
some
sort
of
bird
which
we
are
of
course
and
is
wondering
whether
he
ought
to
flap
his
wings
and
go
up
higher
or
hide
behind
that
church
steeple
of
rock
i
only
hope
he
do
take
a
measly
notion
to
fight
us
that
all
remarked
the
other
as
he
glanced
anxiously
toward
where
the
marlin
was
secured
to
the
framework
of
the
airship
no
danger
of
that
frank
continued
a
condor
is
like
our
vulture
or
buzzard
a
scavenger
and
he
lacks
the
bravery
of
the
eagle
that
attacked
us
when
we
came
near
his
nest
on
the
tip
of
old
thunder
top
look
there
he
off
andy
and
at
a
good
lively
clip
too
old
chap
and
good
luck
andy
had
lost
all
interest
in
the
great
bird
of
the
western
andes
he
was
focusing
his
attention
upon
the
place
that
he
had
marked
as
a
likely
spot
frank
he
said
presently
in
a
husky
voice
could
you
drop
a
little
lower
and
slow
down
some
that
easy
replied
his
chum
readily
enough
what
has
struck
you
now
andy
it
looks
more
and
more
promising
to
me
came
the
slow
reply
as
andy
kept
the
glasses
up
to
his
eyes
then
you
can
glimpse
something
like
cliffs
asked
frank
yes
and
there
no
doubt
about
that
part
i
waiting
now
to
see
if
the
wide
valley
is
wholly
enclosed
and
if
it
is
you
think
it
must
be
the
place
oh
frank
what
if
we
are
near
the
spot
would
he
still
be
alive
or
has
he
given
up
the
fight
that
condor
perched
up
on
the
pinnacle
was
he
only
waiting
for
the
time
to
come
when
he
could
fly
down
perhaps
oh
what
is
that
moving
yonder
look
frank
frank
something
is
coming
up
above
the
top
of
the
mountain
can
you
see
it
if
you
could
only
take
the
glasses
and
tell
me
for
my
hands
are
shaking
so
i
ca
hold
them
brace
up
andy
i
can
see
what
you
mean
without
the
glasses
there
now
it
has
risen
above
the
line
of
rocks
something
that
bobs
to
and
fro
like
no
bird
ever
flew
something
that
floats
now
this
way
and
now
that
just
as
the
wind
blows
andy
upon
my
word
i
believe
it
is
it
must
be
oh
say
it
for
me
please
because
i
just
ca
find
words
cried
the
other
it
was
a
wonder
that
in
their
tremendous
excitement
something
disastrous
did
not
happen
to
the
aeroplane
but
frank
had
wisely
cut
off
some
of
the
power
so
that
they
were
just
making
fair
headway
at
the
time
it
is
a
little
parachute
balloon
just
like
the
one
that
carried
that
message
into
the
cocoa
grove
of
carlos
mendoza
ejaculated
frank
then
it
means
that
we
have
found
the
valley
prison
gasped
andy
sure
that
a
fact
the
cliffs
yonder
are
on
one
side
of
it
frank
cried
and
frank
do
you
see
the
fact
that
another
of
those
little
messengers
of
hope
has
just
come
up
out
of
the
valley
that
he
is
you
just
bet
he
is
andy
and
we
going
to
be
with
him
in
three
shakes
of
a
lamb
tail
declared
the
other
andy
could
not
utter
another
word
he
was
too
full
of
emotion
so
he
just
sat
there
and
stared
and
waited
his
heart
doubtless
thumping
against
his
ribs
as
it
had
never
done
before
of
course
when
frank
gave
utterance
to
that
boast
he
did
not
really
mean
it
and
only
had
the
encouragement
of
his
chum
in
view
he
knew
that
it
was
apt
to
prove
a
difficult
task
landing
in
that
enclosed
valley
where
the
vegetation
must
be
of
a
tropical
order
first
of
all
they
must
circle
around
over
the
wide
expanse
to
take
in
its
features
and
discover
the
prisoner
then
frank
could
lay
his
plans
accordingly
gradually
they
began
to
see
more
and
more
of
those
marvelous
cliffs
they
seemed
to
stretch
in
an
unbroken
cordon
completely
around
the
valley
if
they
were
as
near
like
adamant
as
they
looked
it
would
take
a
man
years
to
cut
steps
to
the
lofty
top
even
though
he
were
given
proper
tools
for
the
work
and
presently
they
cleared
the
near
side
so
that
the
monoplane
floated
directly
above
the
valley
itself
careful
now
andy
warned
the
cautious
frank
hold
yourself
tight
while
we
circle
around
dropping
lower
all
the
time
suppose
you
shout
though
i
should
think
he
have
heard
the
noise
of
our
exhaust
before
now
he
had
hardly
uttered
these
last
words
when
there
came
a
cry
from
below
look
look
frank
there
he
is
oh
what
a
blessed
sight
that
is
my
father
and
alive
after
all
see
how
he
runs
and
waves
his
hands
what
will
he
say
when
he
knows
that
it
his
boy
in
this
airship
come
to
save
him
call
out
and
tell
him
said
frank
hardly
able
to
control
his
own
feelings
though
he
knew
he
must
or
they
might
meet
with
an
accident
in
this
supreme
moment
of
victory
so
andy
did
shout
calling
upon
his
father
wildly
and
waving
his
cap
to
him
the
prisoner
of
the
enclosed
valley
seemed
dazed
at
first
perhaps
he
had
been
deceived
so
many
times
by
his
dreams
of
being
saved
that
he
feared
this
might
prove
only
another
delusion
they
could
see
him
stand
there
and
put
his
hand
to
his
head
as
he
stared
it
was
so
very
wonderful
this
coming
of
a
modern
aeroplane
to
snatch
him
from
his
living
grave
and
then
that
voice
how
like
the
one
he
had
never
expected
to
hear
again
but
by
degrees
as
the
little
bleriot
monoplane
sank
lower
and
the
forms
could
be
more
plainly
seen
he
began
to
grasp
the
truth
again
he
showed
the
most
intense
excitement
waving
his
arms
and
running
to
keep
up
with
them
wait
said
frank
presently
as
he
saw
that
andy
was
so
excited
he
could
not
carry
on
an
intelligent
conversation
i
going
to
speak
with
him
and
find
out
if
there
any
clear
spot
where
we
can
land
uncle
philip
he
shouted
presently
when
andy
had
subsided
this
is
frank
your
nephew
and
andy
your
own
son
is
there
any
clear
place
where
we
can
land
the
aeronaut
understood
because
all
this
was
right
in
line
with
the
profession
which
he
had
been
following
at
the
time
of
his
vanishing
from
mortal
sight
he
indicated
the
quarter
where
a
landing
might
be
risked
and
upon
investigating
by
hovering
over
the
same
frank
decided
that
it
promised
success
so
the
aeroplane
dropped
down
and
touched
ground
it
bumped
along
for
a
little
distance
and
then
andy
leaping
out
managed
to
bring
its
progress
to
a
halt
they
were
in
the
enchanted
valley
from
whence
those
wonderful
messages
had
floated
one
of
which
by
a
strange
freak
of
fate
had
eventually
reached
the
boy
thousands
of
miles
away
for
whose
eyes
it
had
been
intended
and
immediately
andy
was
clasped
in
the
arms
of
his
father
he
knew
him
despite
the
long
gray
beard
which
had
grown
during
his
many
months
of
confinement
with
hope
daily
choked
by
despair
his
clothing
was
almost
in
tatters
and
he
seemed
thin
and
peaked
but
the
look
upon
his
drawn
face
now
was
of
supreme
happiness
then
after
they
had
in
some
measure
recovered
from
all
this
intense
excitement
the
boys
sat
down
to
tell
what
a
miracle
had
been
wrought
bringing
the
message
to
the
home
in
far
away
bloomsbury
with
an
arm
still
encircling
the
form
of
his
boy
professor
bird
listened
and
asked
many
eager
questions
and
to
think
he
said
finally
that
little
messenger
you
saw
going
up
just
now
was
constructed
of
the
very
last
fragment
of
the
old
balloon
silk
i
made
a
fire
with
flint
and
steel
filled
it
with
hot
air
and
sent
it
up
with
prayers
believing
that
it
was
my
forlorn
chance
and
then
i
heard
the
exhaust
of
your
motor
i
feared
my
mind
was
giving
way
under
the
terrible
strain
when
i
looked
up
and
saw
an
aeroplane
sail
into
view
i
fell
down
on
my
face
believing
i
had
gone
mad
but
it
was
a
blessed
reality
thank
god
plans
were
soon
under
discussion
looking
to
leaving
the
valley
as
soon
as
possible
about
this
time
andy
happened
to
think
of
something
and
began
to
fumble
at
his
pocket
oh
how
i
hoped
and
prayed
when
i
bought
that
father
that
i
might
have
the
happiness
of
seeing
you
smoke
some
of
it
he
said
as
he
drew
out
a
little
packet
of
tobacco
on
which
the
late
prisoner
pounced
with
all
the
delight
of
an
inveterate
user
of
the
weed
who
had
long
been
deprived
of
a
pleasure
i
have
been
using
dried
leaves
of
a
wild
grape
and
some
other
things
he
admitted
but
after
all
they
were
only
vile
substitutes
it
was
thoughtful
of
you
my
boy
to
remember
my
weakness
and
andy
snuggled
up
close
to
him
as
he
commenced
to
puff
at
his
pipe
using
a
match
for
the
first
time
in
many
moons
and
smiling
whimsically
when
he
struck
the
same
as
memory
played
queer
pranks
within
meanwhile
frank
wandered
around
to
survey
the
scene
of
the
imprisonment
and
figure
how
they
were
ever
going
to
get
out
with
the
aeroplane
chapter
xxii
rescued
what
the
hurry
asked
andy
when
once
they
began
to
talk
over
their
plans
for
leaving
the
valley
for
once
frank
agreed
with
his
chum
they
had
plenty
to
eat
along
with
them
and
it
might
be
just
as
well
to
wait
for
another
day
by
that
time
all
of
them
would
have
recovered
to
a
great
extent
from
the
excitement
that
had
told
upon
them
particularly
the
professor
none
too
strong
so
it
was
finally
concluded
to
stay
right
where
they
were
until
another
morning
when
one
at
a
time
frank
would
endeavor
to
convey
them
out
of
the
valley
not
daring
to
risk
two
passengers
at
once
with
such
a
poor
field
for
the
start
the
time
passed
quickly
enough
for
there
were
a
thousand
things
to
tell
on
both
sides
the
aeronaut
described
his
accident
and
related
how
he
had
lived
through
all
the
dreary
months
that
had
gone
fortunately
there
did
not
happen
to
be
any
fierce
wild
beasts
in
the
cliff
bordered
valley
and
while
he
had
had
adventures
with
venomous
serpents
fortune
had
stood
by
him
he
showed
numerous
little
contrivances
by
means
of
which
he
had
secured
game
enough
to
supply
his
needs
there
were
nuts
in
abundance
and
some
wild
fruits
which
as
a
scholar
he
knew
the
value
of
water
could
be
had
in
plenty
as
a
lovely
stream
flowed
through
the
valley
diving
down
at
one
end
and
vanishing
in
the
rocks
to
find
an
outlet
such
as
the
human
prisoner
prayed
for
daily
in
vain
why
it
was
evening
almost
before
andy
realized
it
so
quickly
had
the
hours
sped
along
how
proudly
had
his
father
asked
all
about
the
monoplane
which
he
examined
with
the
most
intense
interest
knowing
it
to
have
been
mostly
made
by
the
two
enterprising
bird
boys
prom
the
way
in
which
he
smiled
and
nodded
his
head
after
this
survey
it
was
evident
that
he
was
very
well
pleased
with
what
they
had
done
and
he
also
made
them
tell
all
about
that
famous
race
through
the
air
to
the
hitherto
unsealed
crown
of
old
thunder
top
which
he
remembered
very
well
and
now
let
think
of
having
a
jolly
little
meal
said
frank
as
the
shadows
began
to
lengthen
down
below
the
lofty
cliffs
which
was
a
pretty
good
indication
that
night
could
not
be
far
away
count
me
in
said
andy
jumping
up
for
it
was
his
duty
to
get
busy
when
the
time
came
to
make
a
fire
and
prepare
a
repast
i
guess
got
coffee
for
a
few
times
yet
and
i
smuggled
a
can
of
boston
baked
beans
along
when
frank
was
looking
knowing
that
father
used
to
be
right
fond
of
coffee
beans
why
you
fairly
take
my
breath
away
exclaimed
the
one
who
for
so
many
months
had
been
deprived
of
all
the
comforts
of
civilization
and
forced
to
sustain
his
life
in
the
most
primitive
manner
when
supper
was
cooking
the
professor
made
some
excuse
to
wander
off
frank
knew
though
what
ailed
him
it
the
aroma
of
that
blessed
coffee
that
what
he
said
to
andy
who
had
looked
a
little
troubled
at
this
action
on
the
part
of
his
father
it
been
so
long
since
he
smelled
it
that
it
just
makes
him
wild
i
know
because
i
had
a
little
experience
that
way
myself
once
only
it
was
two
weeks
i
had
to
go
without
when
we
were
camping
and
not
many
months
when
supper
ready
he
come
with
a
rush
mark
me
andy
and
he
proved
to
be
a
true
prophet
for
no
sooner
had
andy
lifted
up
his
voice
to
call
that
the
meal
was
ready
than
the
professor
broke
through
the
bushes
and
hastened
to
take
his
place
frank
lost
not
a
second
in
filling
a
tin
cup
of
the
amber
liquid
and
handing
it
to
the
late
prisoner
of
the
valley
he
tasted
and
then
nodded
his
head
nectar
for
the
gods
my
boys
he
declared
one
never
knows
how
little
things
like
this
go
to
make
up
a
portion
of
one
life
until
a
cruel
fate
has
deprived
him
of
them
all
and
to
think
i
have
a
boy
so
thoughtful
as
to
fetch
along
a
packet
of
smoking
tobacco
and
a
can
of
the
real
boston
baked
beans
thank
you
frank
that
a
heaping
pannikin
you
given
me
but
i
suspect
i
equal
to
the
job
they
made
a
happy
trio
as
they
ate
and
chatted
and
laughed
perhaps
that
was
the
first
hearty
laugh
professor
bird
had
given
utterance
to
since
the
day
he
started
in
his
balloon
from
colon
on
the
caribbean
coast
to
cross
the
isthmus
of
panama
before
they
went
to
sleep
that
night
all
preparations
had
been
concluded
looking
to
getting
out
of
the
trap
in
the
morning
frank
had
made
his
estimations
and
knew
to
a
nicety
just
what
his
engine
could
do
once
free
from
the
valley
he
believed
they
could
head
direct
for
the
distant
magdalena
carrying
two
passengers
and
making
short
flights
it
was
true
that
as
yet
he
had
never
taken
up
any
second
passenger
and
it
entailed
an
additional
tax
upon
the
motor
but
he
had
great
faith
in
the
little
kinkaid
engine
and
felt
that
it
would
respond
nobly
to
any
additional
demand
made
upon
it
but
it
would
be
advisable
that
he
carry
the
professor
out
of
the
valley
and
land
him
on
that
plateau
where
they
had
made
their
last
halt
ere
going
back
for
andy
then
from
that
elevated
place
they
could
start
on
the
return
trip
with
everything
favorable
for
a
successful
flight
the
night
passed
at
length
though
it
must
have
seemed
interminable
to
andy
frank
knew
that
often
his
chum
would
rise
up
on
his
elbow
and
put
out
a
hand
gently
just
to
touch
the
form
of
his
sleeping
father
close
to
him
and
frank
did
not
wonder
at
it
for
there
were
times
when
even
he
found
it
difficult
to
realize
that
their
remarkable
mission
had
actually
proven
successful
at
length
the
day
came
they
were
early
astir
for
much
remained
to
be
done
and
there
would
needs
be
deft
manipulation
of
the
gallant
little
monoplane
by
its
clever
pilot
if
two
separate
flights
out
of
the
enclosed
valley
were
to
be
undertaken
finally
all
was
ready
the
professor
had
really
next
to
nothing
he
wished
to
bring
away
the
valley
had
grown
hateful
to
him
because
of
his
enforced
stay
and
he
never
wanted
to
see
it
again
he
took
his
place
in
the
seat
usually
occupied
by
andy
his
face
was
grave
for
he
knew
what
risks
they
were
running
but
surely
the
lad
who
had
piloted
the
frail
craft
through
so
many
perils
would
not
fail
now
both
of
you
said
andy
beaming
upon
them
as
he
prepared
to
assist
in
the
launching
please
do
forget
me
down
here
and
let
me
root
hog
or
die
for
months
birds
of
a
feather
flock
together
you
know
so
come
back
again
frank
then
came
the
start
it
was
anything
but
an
easy
job
to
get
going
in
the
small
space
allowed
by
the
character
of
the
valley
but
frank
had
figured
it
all
out
measured
the
ground
removed
such
obstructions
as
promised
to
give
trouble
and
had
perfect
confidence
in
his
ability
to
make
it
and
he
did
after
that
other
ascent
in
the
heart
of
the
tropical
forest
he
declared
he
did
not
mean
to
let
anything
appal
him
henceforth
once
they
started
circling
the
valley
low
down
and
just
missing
the
tops
of
the
trees
growing
there
andy
sent
vigorous
whoops
after
them
and
his
father
answered
by
waving
his
hand
for
hat
he
had
none
so
guided
by
the
master
hand
of
frank
bird
the
aeroplane
rose
above
the
line
of
those
hateful
and
cruel
cliffs
and
for
the
first
time
since
his
captivity
the
man
of
science
saw
the
blessed
outside
world
again
there
was
no
trouble
landing
him
on
the
accommodating
plateau
after
which
the
aeroplane
started
back
for
its
second
passenger
frank
abated
his
vigilance
not
a
particle
he
knew
that
constant
watchfulness
must
be
the
price
of
safety
when
one
is
venturing
to
imitate
the
birds
and
soar
through
the
upper
currents
of
the
air
down
into
the
valley
he
dropped
the
monoplane
behaving
beautifully
and
presently
he
was
shaking
the
hand
of
his
chum
again
once
more
was
a
start
made
frank
breathed
easier
after
it
had
proven
a
success
for
there
were
narrow
escapes
from
a
collision
with
some
obstacle
and
he
knew
only
too
well
what
that
stood
for
now
we
all
right
i
guess
sang
out
andy
as
they
came
out
of
the
depths
and
frank
turned
the
airship
in
the
direction
of
the
distant
plateau
naturally
andy
was
as
happy
as
a
lark
singing
and
calling
as
they
glided
along
and
finding
scores
of
causes
for
attracting
the
attention
of
his
chum
finally
frank
had
to
caution
him
to
slow
down
and
not
try
to
make
him
look
so
much
the
trip
was
made
in
perfect
safety
indeed
andy
was
now
so
confident
of
the
capacity
of
the
monoplane
as
well
as
the
skill
of
its
pilot
that
he
expressed
himself
as
ready
to
go
anywhere
in
such
a
craft
with
such
a
driver
it
required
some
planning
to
arrange
matters
so
that
both
andy
and
his
father
could
be
carried
at
the
same
time
but
frank
had
been
figuring
on
this
and
fixed
it
in
his
mind
even
after
the
start
he
felt
more
apprehensive
than
he
allowed
the
others
to
see
for
this
was
after
all
an
experiment
aviators
have
gone
up
with
two
passengers
and
in
monoplanes
too
but
the
limit
of
their
stay
aloft
had
never
exceeded
two
hours
for
the
strain
is
very
great
so
frank
hoped
to
find
places
where
they
might
drop
down
to
rest
thus
making
the
journey
in
easy
stages
he
believed
they
had
plenty
of
gasoline
to
see
them
through
for
an
additional
supply
had
been
carried
when
starting
from
the
neighborhood
of
the
boat
but
once
they
were
afloat
he
realized
that
he
had
been
borrowing
needless
trouble
for
the
gallant
little
aircraft
just
acted
beautifully
and
seemed
to
be
able
to
speed
merrily
along
with
two
passengers
almost
as
well
as
with
but
one
of
course
there
were
many
chances
for
trouble
there
always
are
when
traveling
in
an
aeroplane
since
the
least
thing
that
goes
wrong
means
a
descent
or
a
fall
frank
tried
no
lofty
flight
he
kept
close
above
the
tree
tops
content
to
make
steady
progress
in
the
direction
where
his
little
compass
told
him
they
would
find
the
river
once
away
from
the
mountainous
country
and
they
were
able
to
descend
to
still
lower
levels
where
the
chilly
air
changed
to
hot
and
there
were
signs
of
life
among
the
trees
below
birds
monkeys
and
other
natives
of
the
wilds
showing
themselves
at
times
it
must
have
been
a
glorious
sensation
to
the
old
aeronaut
to
be
thus
speeding
along
in
a
modern
airship
after
his
enforced
idleness
for
so
long
again
and
again
did
he
express
himself
in
that
way
as
he
gazed
over
the
expanse
of
country
and
then
allowed
his
eyes
to
rest
fondly
on
the
form
of
his
boy
more
dear
to
his
heart
than
ever
after
what
had
happened
i
think
i
see
an
open
place
beyond
remarked
frank
after
they
had
been
moving
something
like
two
hours
after
leaving
the
high
plateau
and
it
might
be
wise
while
we
have
the
chance
to
go
down
and
look
things
over
then
we
will
feel
fit
for
another
spell
of
work
accordingly
the
aeroplane
was
headed
downward
they
circled
the
opening
once
or
twice
in
order
that
the
pilot
of
the
aircraft
might
get
his
bearings
perfectly
and
then
he
headed
for
the
ground
even
as
they
were
just
approaching
the
earth
frank
heard
andy
give
one
of
his
customary
exclamations
such
as
announced
an
important
discovery
frank
there
the
biplane
in
the
opening
was
what
he
cried
yes
frank
himself
had
sighted
it
now
but
the
discovery
came
too
late
to
have
any
effect
upon
their
movements
since
they
were
bound
to
land
not
having
room
to
rise
again
even
did
they
wish
to
do
so
and
frank
as
he
felt
the
wheels
under
the
aeroplane
touch
the
earth
also
heard
a
loud
cry
and
some
lusty
spanish
expletives
as
a
pistol
was
discharged
chapter
xxiii
homeward
bound
conclusion
as
was
his
usual
habit
andy
jumped
before
the
monoplane
had
stopped
frank
on
his
part
had
no
sooner
seen
that
everything
was
going
well
than
he
snatched
the
marlin
rifle
from
its
fastenings
he
realized
that
they
were
up
against
trouble
of
some
sort
for
those
spanish
exclamations
told
him
there
must
be
one
revolutionist
at
least
close
by
ready
to
do
battle
frank
look
out
he
got
a
pistol
cried
a
voice
which
he
recognized
as
belonging
to
puss
carberry
just
then
he
caught
sight
of
a
figure
rushing
forward
it
was
the
same
man
no
doubt
whom
they
had
seen
with
puss
in
the
biplane
they
had
evidently
broken
some
important
parts
in
landing
and
ever
since
must
have
been
busy
trying
to
mend
the
same
stop
when
the
advancing
revolutionist
heard
this
sharp
command
and
saw
that
he
was
being
covered
by
a
rifle
in
the
hands
of
the
determined
looking
pilot
of
the
monoplane
he
sized
up
the
situation
and
then
raised
his
hands
in
a
way
that
meant
he
surrendered
drop
that
gun
then
ordered
frank
and
as
he
did
so
puss
seized
upon
it
with
a
snarl
of
joy
now
we
see
how
two
can
play
at
that
game
you
skunk
gritted
the
other
as
he
snapped
the
pistol
straight
at
the
head
of
the
man
here
none
of
that
puss
you
leave
him
to
us
he
our
prisoner
not
yours
ordered
frank
horrified
at
the
rage
which
the
other
had
shown
so
puss
found
that
he
did
not
have
any
authority
in
the
matter
and
that
if
he
wanted
to
get
assistance
from
his
rivals
in
order
to
finish
mending
his
airship
and
get
away
from
so
dangerous
a
locality
he
must
do
what
they
said
he
told
about
how
he
and
sandy
had
been
out
for
a
trial
spin
two
days
before
that
was
when
frank
and
his
chum
had
sighted
them
from
the
river
but
that
very
night
some
of
the
revolutionists
had
made
a
descent
on
the
home
of
his
uncle
who
had
a
cocoa
plantation
not
many
miles
away
from
that
of
mendoza
seized
him
and
carried
him
away
as
they
also
did
the
little
airship
threatened
with
dire
things
if
he
refused
to
obey
he
had
been
compelled
to
go
up
in
company
with
the
man
who
was
now
their
prisoner
a
spaniard
who
had
once
sailed
in
a
balloon
and
knew
something
about
that
type
of
aviation
though
having
much
to
learn
in
connection
with
modern
aeroplanes
sighting
our
two
bird
boys
of
course
puss
had
known
who
they
were
but
the
man
was
positive
that
they
must
be
spies
sent
out
by
the
government
to
learn
what
the
revolutionists
might
be
doing
up
the
magdalena
and
he
had
threatened
all
sorts
of
things
puss
declared
unless
a
hot
pursuit
were
carried
on
secretly
frank
was
of
the
opinion
that
it
would
require
very
little
urging
to
make
puss
carberry
do
his
level
best
to
overtake
any
aerial
craft
piloted
by
one
frank
bird
toward
whom
he
had
always
felt
the
most
bitter
animosity
after
about
an
hour
hard
work
frank
managed
to
get
the
biplane
in
decent
trim
for
a
flight
he
was
also
able
to
spare
the
other
some
gasoline
had
he
been
allowed
to
have
his
own
way
puss
would
have
left
the
spaniard
in
the
forest
where
he
might
have
died
being
unable
to
make
his
way
to
civilization
but
frank
would
not
hear
of
it
he
obtained
a
solemn
promise
from
the
man
that
he
would
not
make
any
further
effort
to
obtain
control
of
the
biplane
and
then
puss
was
made
to
take
him
aboard
of
course
frank
had
made
sure
that
the
man
carried
no
weapon
and
that
his
revolver
was
thrown
away
they
left
the
glade
in
the
forest
soon
after
the
biplane
had
started
puss
managed
to
keep
close
to
the
others
while
they
headed
off
toward
the
northeast
he
did
not
wholly
trust
the
passenger
he
was
carrying
and
wanted
to
remain
within
call
of
the
three
who
relied
upon
the
monoplane
to
carry
them
to
safety
they
could
even
shout
out
to
each
other
as
they
sailed
along
thus
puss
warned
them
when
they
were
approaching
a
camp
of
the
revolutionists
as
they
drew
near
the
region
of
the
river
and
they
were
able
to
change
their
course
not
wishing
to
again
run
the
perilous
gantlet
of
when
another
descent
was
deemed
necessary
it
was
close
to
the
magdalena
though
many
miles
south
of
the
town
where
the
cocoa
planters
lived
there
was
no
reason
why
puss
should
also
descend
save
that
he
wished
to
be
rid
of
his
unwelcome
passenger
the
revolutionist
might
now
make
his
way
to
camp
and
electrify
his
fellows
with
a
stirring
account
of
his
various
adventures
and
one
could
easily
guess
that
they
would
lose
none
of
their
zest
in
the
telling
puss
did
not
expect
to
halt
again
when
the
monoplane
was
brought
down
he
could
make
one
flight
of
it
now
and
reach
the
home
of
his
uncle
where
doubtless
sandy
was
mourning
him
as
lost
just
as
frank
had
expected
puss
on
saying
tried
to
appear
as
though
something
along
the
order
of
gratitude
might
be
striving
to
gain
a
foothold
in
his
crooked
nature
say
frank
i
sorry
now
i
ever
tried
to
do
you
dirt
he
observed
as
he
held
out
his
hand
let
forget
the
past
and
start
all
over
again
sure
replied
frank
as
he
readily
took
the
offered
hand
but
it
lay
like
a
cold
toad
in
his
grasp
as
andy
afterward
expressed
it
for
puss
insisted
on
also
bidding
him
ere
he
made
a
start
in
his
biplane
well
now
what
d
think
of
that
said
andy
as
they
stood
and
watched
the
other
mount
upward
and
caught
the
wave
of
his
hand
ere
he
started
down
river
being
fully
five
hundred
feet
high
did
he
mean
it
frank
would
you
really
want
to
go
so
far
as
to
trust
that
snake
if
the
chance
ever
came
again
for
him
to
do
you
a
bad
turn
frank
shrugged
his
shoulders
say
ask
me
something
easy
wo
you
he
remarked
because
you
know
how
hard
it
is
for
a
leopard
to
change
its
spots
perhaps
puss
seen
a
light
but
excuse
me
if
i
doubt
it
naturally
he
felt
kind
of
cheap
because
we
got
him
out
of
a
bad
hole
and
placed
him
under
obligations
but
that
will
wear
off
in
a
short
time
right
it
will
declared
andy
i
give
you
my
word
frank
that
the
next
time
we
see
him
he
have
a
fine
story
all
fixed
about
how
he
was
just
going
to
jump
on
that
spanish
revolutionary
fellow
and
twisting
his
gun
out
of
his
hand
shoot
him
down
and
then
fly
away
oh
do
i
know
puss
in
boots
though
he
hate
us
both
worse
than
ever
just
because
he
beholden
to
us
rats
him
reform
not
much
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
they
had
advanced
far
enough
to
know
that
another
lap
ought
to
carry
them
to
town
and
of
course
all
of
them
were
anxious
to
have
the
journey
completed
if
it
could
only
be
written
up
and
sworn
to
said
andy
enthusiastically
i
reckon
it
go
down
in
the
annals
of
aeroplaning
as
the
most
wonderful
stunt
carried
out
up
to
date
but
people
wo
take
our
word
for
it
we
got
the
evidence
of
it
though
in
the
person
of
your
good
dad
and
people
may
believe
what
professor
bird
says
over
his
own
honored
signature
however
much
they
might
doubt
the
yarn
of
a
couple
of
boys
frank
remarked
as
he
took
a
last
look
to
see
that
both
his
passengers
were
snugly
settled
ere
starting
the
motor
we
on
the
home
stretch
now
declared
andy
after
they
had
again
mounted
up
into
the
realm
of
space
and
found
their
course
northward
yes
observed
frank
we
homing
pigeons
now
if
any
kind
of
bird
at
any
rate
laughed
the
professor
we
birds
of
passage
and
one
of
them
is
mighty
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
get
back
into
the
old
world
again
in
due
time
they
sighted
the
town
and
as
before
the
greatest
excitement
followed
as
they
headed
across
the
place
looking
to
land
where
the
journey
had
begun
in
the
yard
of
the
cocoa
planter
place
of
course
señor
carlos
was
delighted
with
the
success
of
the
mission
for
two
days
the
bird
boys
were
the
center
of
an
enthusiastic
demonstration
frank
was
a
little
nervous
lest
they
be
visited
by
some
of
the
revolutionists
but
such
did
not
turn
out
to
be
the
case
and
on
the
third
morning
the
little
steam
yacht
once
more
headed
down
the
turbulent
magdalena
with
a
heavy
rain
promising
more
water
to
add
to
the
flood
as
wet
weather
had
seemingly
set
in
again
they
met
with
no
difficulties
on
the
way
down
apparently
the
camp
of
the
revolutionists
had
been
moved
from
its
former
position
at
the
narrows
of
the
river
it
might
be
those
in
charge
had
taken
the
alarm
and
feared
lest
a
government
force
must
be
on
the
way
to
capture
them
after
being
informed
about
the
camp
by
the
spies
they
had
sent
up
the
river
and
barranquila
was
finally
reached
where
they
halted
only
long
enough
to
chat
a
short
time
with
señor
josé
who
met
them
as
before
on
the
quay
and
wanted
to
shake
hands
with
the
professor
knowing
just
how
anxious
the
government
was
to
get
possession
of
airships
just
then
frank
did
not
want
to
give
them
any
further
chance
to
confiscate
his
neat
little
craft
under
some
pretense
or
other
so
they
left
the
city
at
the
mouth
of
the
magdalena
and
steamed
away
bound
once
more
for
maracaibo
where
they
meant
to
take
steamer
for
new
york
new
orleans
or
any
port
in
the
states
the
last
glimpse
they
had
of
the
river
was
the
flood
that
was
pouring
out
between
the
jaws
of
land
marking
one
of
the
mouths
of
the
magdalena
and
making
a
distinct
yellow
area
in
the
salty
waters
of
the
tropical
ocean
the
beloved
little
aeroplane
had
been
safely
boxed
again
and
was
making
the
homeward
voyage
in
their
company
what
strange
and
wonderful
things
it
had
been
through
andy
declared
that
they
almost
passed
belief
and
he
expressed
his
doubts
as
to
their
ever
having
an
opportunity
to
pilot
that
same
aircraft
through
atmospheric
seas
as
tempestuous
as
those
they
had
experienced
in
the
tropics
while
rescuing
the
prisoner
of
the
cliff
bordered
valley
but
then
andy
was
not
gifted
with
second
sight
and
he
could
not
foresee
what
the
wonderful
future
might
have
in
store
for
the
bird
boys
they
had
by
this
time
experienced
enough
of
the
fascinating
new
methods
of
cruising
in
cloudland
to
want
to
continue
and
it
stands
to
reason
that
other
adventures
would
be
lying
in
wait
for
lads
so
constituted
for
the
present
it
must
be
enough
to
say
they
arrived
safely
at
