chapter
i
jim
leslie
writes
a
letter
in
a
sitting
room
of
a
new
york
boarding
house
four
youths
were
holding
a
discussion
the
sitting
room
was
large
and
square
and
in
the
wildest
disorder
which
was
however
sublimated
into
a
certain
system
by
an
illuminated
device
to
the
effect
that
one
should
have
a
place
for
everything
and
then
there
be
one
place
you
wo
have
to
look
easels
and
artists
materials
thrust
back
to
the
wall
sufficiently
advertised
the
art
student
and
perhaps
explained
the
untidiness
two
of
the
occupants
of
the
room
curled
up
on
elevated
window
ledges
were
emitting
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
and
nursing
their
knees
the
other
two
naked
to
the
waist
sat
on
a
couple
of
ordinary
bedroom
mattresses
deposited
carefully
in
the
vacant
centre
of
the
apartment
they
were
eager
young
men
curly
of
hair
and
possessing
in
common
an
unabashed
carriage
of
the
head
which
more
plainly
than
any
mere
facial
resemblance
proved
them
brothers
they
too
were
nursing
their
knees
he
must
be
an
unadorned
ass
remarked
one
of
the
occupants
of
the
window
seats
in
answer
to
some
previous
statement
he
is
not
categorically
denied
a
youth
of
the
mattresses
my
dear
hench
you
make
no
distinctions
i
been
talking
about
the
people
and
his
bringing
up
and
the
way
he
acts
whereupon
you
fly
off
on
a
tangent
and
coolly
conclude
things
about
the
boy
himself
it
is
not
only
unkind
but
stupid
hench
laughed
you
amuse
me
jeems
said
he
elucidate
jeems
let
go
his
knees
the
upper
part
of
his
body
thus
deprived
of
support
fell
backward
on
the
mattress
he
then
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
head
and
stared
at
the
ceiling
listen
ye
multitude
he
began
i
an
artist
so
are
you
i
also
a
philosopher
you
are
not
therefore
i
deign
to
instruct
you
ben
de
laney
has
a
father
and
a
mother
the
father
is
pompous
conceited
and
a
bore
the
mother
is
pompous
conceited
and
a
bore
the
father
uses
language
of
whose
absolutely
vapid
correctness
addison
would
have
been
proud
so
does
the
mother
unless
she
forgets
in
which
case
the
old
man
calls
her
down
hard
they
are
rich
and
of
a
good
social
position
the
latter
worries
them
because
they
have
to
keep
up
its
dignity
they
succeed
interrupted
the
other
brother
fervently
they
succeed
i
dined
there
once
after
that
i
went
around
to
the
waxworks
to
get
cheered
up
a
bit
quite
so
bertie
replied
the
philosopher
but
you
interrupted
me
just
before
i
got
to
my
point
the
poor
old
creatures
had
been
married
many
years
before
bennie
came
to
cheer
up
naturally
bennie
has
been
the
whole
thing
ever
since
he
is
allowed
a
few
privileges
but
always
under
the
best
auspices
the
rest
of
the
time
he
stays
at
home
is
told
what
or
what
not
a
gentleman
should
do
and
is
instructed
in
the
genealogy
of
the
de
laneys
the
mother
is
always
impressing
him
with
the
fact
that
he
is
a
de
laney
on
both
sides
interpolated
bert
important
if
true
as
the
newspapers
say
remarked
the
other
young
man
on
the
window
ledge
what
constitutes
a
de
laney
hereditary
lack
of
humour
beck
my
boy
well
the
result
is
that
poor
bennie
is
a
sort
of
the
speaker
hesitated
for
his
word
boy
suggested
beck
mildly
something
of
the
sort
but
not
exactly
a
boy
never
has
ideas
bennie
has
such
as
well
for
one
thing
he
wants
to
get
away
he
does
seem
quite
content
with
his
job
of
idle
aristocrat
i
believe
he
been
pestering
the
old
man
to
send
him
west
old
man
does
approve
the
fine
bloom
of
culture
will
become
rubbed
off
in
the
contact
with
rude
rough
men
seems
to
me
inevitable
mimicked
bert
in
pedantic
tones
a
firm
sense
of
personal
dignity
and
an
equally
firm
sense
of
our
obligations
to
more
refined
though
absent
friends
hedges
us
about
with
adequate
safeguards
the
four
laughed
that
his
style
sure
enough
jim
agreed
what
does
he
want
to
do
west
asked
hench
does
know
write
a
book
i
believe
or
something
of
that
sort
but
he
an
ass
he
has
a
lot
of
good
stuff
in
him
only
it
will
never
get
a
chance
fixed
the
way
he
is
now
a
silence
fell
which
was
broken
at
last
by
bert
come
jeems
he
suggested
here
we
taken
up
hench
valuable
idea
but
are
no
farther
with
it
true
said
jeems
he
rolled
over
on
his
hands
and
knees
bert
took
up
a
similar
position
by
his
side
go
shouted
hench
from
the
window
ledge
at
the
word
the
two
on
the
mattress
turned
and
grappled
each
other
fiercely
half
rising
to
their
feet
in
the
strenuousness
of
endeavour
jeems
tried
frantically
for
a
while
preventing
it
the
wily
bert
awaited
his
chance
for
a
in
the
moment
of
indecision
as
to
which
would
succeed
in
his
charitable
design
a
knock
on
the
door
put
an
end
to
hostilities
the
gladiators
sat
upright
and
panted
a
young
man
stepped
bashfully
into
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
the
newcomer
was
a
young
fellow
of
perhaps
years
of
age
with
regular
features
brown
eyes
straight
hair
and
sensitive
lips
he
was
exceedingly
a
moment
pause
followed
his
appearance
then
why
it
our
old
friend
the
kid
cried
jeems
do
let
me
interrupt
begged
the
youth
diffidently
no
interruption
end
of
round
one
panted
jeems
glad
you
came
bertie
here
was
twisting
my
delicate
clavicle
most
cruelly
know
hench
and
beck
there
de
laney
bowed
to
the
young
men
in
the
window
who
removed
their
pipes
from
their
mouths
and
grinned
amiably
this
gentlemen
explained
jeems
without
changing
his
position
is
bennie
de
laney
on
both
sides
it
is
extremely
fortunate
for
de
laney
that
he
is
a
de
laney
on
both
sides
for
otherwise
he
would
be
you
will
find
a
seat
de
laney
in
the
adjoining
bedroom
said
the
first
with
great
politeness
and
if
you
do
care
to
go
in
there
you
will
stand
yourself
in
the
corner
by
that
easel
until
the
conclusion
of
this
little
discussion
between
jeems
and
jeems
will
you
kindly
state
the
merits
of
the
discussion
to
the
gentleman
i
out
of
breath
jeems
kindly
would
bert
and
i
have
for
the
last
few
weeks
been
obeying
the
parting
commands
of
our
dear
mother
said
she
with
tears
in
her
eyes
always
take
care
of
one
another
so
each
evening
i
have
tried
to
tuck
bertie
in
his
little
bed
and
bertie
with
equal
enthusiasm
has
attempted
to
tuck
in
it
has
been
hard
on
pyjamas
bed
springs
and
the
temper
of
the
lady
with
the
piano
who
resides
in
the
apartments
immediately
beneath
so
at
the
wise
suggestion
of
our
friends
in
the
windows
he
waved
a
graceful
hand
toward
them
and
they
gravely
bowed
acknowledgment
we
are
now
engaged
in
deciding
the
matter
the
winner
come
on
bertie
the
two
again
took
position
side
by
side
on
their
hands
and
knees
while
hench
explained
to
de
laney
that
this
method
of
beginning
the
bout
was
necessary
because
the
limited
area
of
the
mat
precluded
flying
falls
at
a
signal
from
beck
they
turned
and
grappled
jeems
by
the
grace
of
providence
on
top
in
the
course
of
the
combat
it
often
happened
that
the
two
mattresses
would
slide
apart
the
contestants
suspending
their
struggles
would
then
try
to
kick
them
together
again
without
releasing
the
advantage
of
their
holds
the
noise
was
beautiful
to
de
laney
strong
in
maternal
admonitions
as
to
proper
deportment
it
was
all
new
and
stirring
and
quite
without
precedent
he
applauded
excitedly
and
made
as
much
racket
as
the
rest
a
sudden
and
vigorous
knock
for
the
second
time
put
an
end
to
hostilities
the
wrestlers
again
sat
bolt
upright
on
the
mattresses
and
listened
gentlemen
cried
an
irritated
german
voice
there
is
a
lady
schleeping
on
the
next
floor
karl
karl
called
one
of
the
irrepressibles
can
i
never
teach
you
to
be
accurate
no
lady
could
possibly
be
sleeping
anywhere
in
the
building
he
arose
from
the
mattress
and
shook
himself
jeems
he
continued
sadly
the
world
is
against
true
virtue
our
dear
mother
wishes
can
not
be
respected
de
laney
came
out
of
his
corner
fellows
he
cried
with
enthusiasm
i
want
you
to
come
up
and
stay
all
night
with
me
some
time
so
mother
can
see
that
gentlemen
can
make
a
noise
bertie
sat
down
suddenly
and
shrieked
jeems
rolled
over
and
over
clutching
small
feathers
from
the
mattress
in
the
agony
of
his
delight
while
the
clothed
youths
contented
themselves
with
amused
but
gurgling
chuckles
bennie
my
boy
gasped
jeems
at
last
you
be
the
death
of
me
o
lord
o
lord
you
unfortunate
infant
you
shall
come
here
and
have
a
drum
to
pound
yes
you
shall
he
tottered
weakly
to
his
feet
come
bertie
let
us
go
get
dressed
the
two
disappeared
into
the
bedroom
leaving
de
laney
uncomfortably
alone
with
the
occupants
of
the
window
ledge
the
young
fellow
walked
awkwardly
across
the
room
and
sat
down
on
a
partly
empty
chair
not
because
he
preferred
sitting
to
standing
but
in
order
to
give
himself
time
to
recover
from
his
embarrassment
the
sort
of
chaffing
to
which
he
had
just
been
subjected
was
direct
and
brutal
it
touched
all
his
tender
spots
the
very
spots
wherein
he
realized
the
intensest
soreness
of
his
deficiencies
and
about
which
therefore
he
was
the
most
sensitive
yet
somehow
he
liked
it
this
was
because
the
leslie
boys
meant
to
him
everything
free
and
young
that
he
had
missed
in
the
precise
atmosphere
of
his
own
home
and
so
he
admired
them
and
stood
in
delightful
inferiority
to
them
in
spite
of
his
wealth
and
position
he
would
have
given
anything
he
owned
to
have
felt
himself
one
of
their
sort
but
failing
that
the
next
best
thing
was
to
possess
their
intimacy
of
this
intimacy
chaffing
was
a
gauge
bennington
clarence
de
laney
always
glowed
at
heart
when
they
rubbed
his
fur
the
wrong
way
for
it
showed
that
they
felt
they
knew
him
well
enough
to
do
so
and
in
this
there
was
something
just
a
little
pathetic
bennington
held
to
the
society
standpoint
with
men
so
he
thought
he
must
keep
up
a
conversation
he
did
so
it
was
laboured
bennington
thought
of
things
to
say
about
art
the
theatre
and
books
hench
and
beck
looked
at
each
other
from
time
to
time
finally
the
door
opened
and
to
the
relief
of
all
two
sweatered
and
individuals
appeared
and
now
jeems
we
smoke
the
pipe
of
peace
suggested
bert
diving
for
the
mantel
and
the
pipe
rack
correct
my
boy
responded
jeems
doing
likewise
they
lit
up
and
turned
with
simultaneous
interest
to
their
latest
caller
and
how
is
the
proud
plutocrat
inquired
bert
and
how
did
he
contrive
to
get
leave
to
visit
us
rude
and
vulgar
persons
the
leslies
had
called
at
the
de
laneys
and
as
bert
said
had
dined
there
once
they
recognised
their
status
and
rejoiced
therein
he
is
calling
on
the
minister
explained
jeems
for
him
bennington
my
son
you
get
caught
at
that
some
day
as
sure
as
shooting
if
your
mamma
ever
found
out
that
instead
of
talking
to
old
garnett
you
were
revelling
in
this
awful
dissipation
you
have
to
go
abroad
again
what
did
you
call
him
inquired
bert
call
who
him
bennie
what
was
that
full
name
bennington
great
scott
and
here
i
been
thinking
all
the
time
he
was
plain
benjamin
tell
us
about
it
my
boy
what
is
it
it
sounds
like
a
battle
of
the
revolution
it
a
battle
of
the
revolution
just
to
think
that
all
this
time
we
have
been
entertaining
unawares
a
real
live
battle
de
laney
grinned
as
usual
it
a
family
name
said
he
it
the
name
of
an
ancestor
he
never
knew
whether
or
not
these
vivacious
youths
really
desired
the
varied
information
they
demanded
the
leslies
looked
upon
him
with
awe
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
said
bertie
that
you
are
a
bennington
well
well
this
is
a
small
world
we
will
celebrate
the
discovery
he
walked
to
the
door
and
touched
a
bell
five
times
beautiful
system
he
explained
in
a
moment
karl
will
appear
with
five
beers
this
arrangement
is
possible
because
never
in
any
circumstances
do
we
ring
for
anything
but
beer
the
beer
came
two
steins
two
glasses
and
a
carefully
scrubbed
shaving
mug
were
pressed
into
service
after
the
excitement
of
finding
all
these
things
had
died
and
the
five
men
were
grouped
about
the
place
in
ungraceful
but
comfortable
attitudes
bennington
bid
for
the
sympathy
he
had
sought
in
this
visit
fellows
said
he
i
something
to
tell
you
let
her
flicker
said
jim

none
of
them
i
going
to
the
real

i
going
to
a
mining
camp
the
leslies
straightened
their
backbones
do
spring
things
on
us
that
way
reproved
bertie
severely
give
us
heart
disease
now
repeat
softly
i
am
going
to
a
mining
camp
obeyed
bennington
a
little
shamefacedly
with
whom
alone
this
time
the
leslies
sprang
quite
to
their
feet
by
the
great
horn
spoon
man
cried
jim
alone
no
chaperon
good
lord
yes
said
bennington
i
always
wanted
to
go
west
i
want
to
write
and
i
sure
in
that
great
free
country
i
get
a
chance
for
development
i
had
to
work
hard
to
induce
father
and
mother
to
consent
but
it
done
now
and
i
leave
next
week
father
procured
me
a
position

there
in
one
of
the
camps
i
to
be
local
treasurer
or
something
like
that
i
not
quite
sure
you
see
for
i
have
talked
with
bishop
yet
i
go
to
his
office
for
directions
at
the
mention
of
bishop
the
leslies
glanced
at
each
other
behind
the
young
man
back
bishop
repeated
jim
where
your
job
located
in
the
black
hills
of
south
dakota
somewhere
near
a
little
place
called
spanish
gulch
this
time
the
leslies
winked
at
each
other
it
a
nice
country
commented
bert
vaguely
i
been
there
oh
have
you
cried
the
young
man
what
it
like
hills
pines
log
houses
good
hunting
oh
it
western
enough
a
clock
struck
in
a
church
tower
outside
in
spite
of
himself
bennington
started
better
run
along
home
laughed
jim
your
mamma
will
be
angry
to
prove
that
this
consideration
carried
no
weight
bennington
stayed
ten
minutes
longer
then
he
descended
the
five
flights
of
stairs
deliberately
enough
but
once
out
of
earshot
of
his
friends
he
ran
several
blocks
before
going
into
the
house
he
took
off
his
shoes
in
spite
of
the
precaution
his
mother
called
to
him
as
he
passed
her
room
it
was
half
past
ten
beck
and
hench
kicked
de
laney
chair
aside
and
drew
up
more
comfortably
before
the
fire
but
james
would
have
none
of
it
he
seemed
to
be
excited
no
he
vetoed
decidedly
you
fellows
have
got
to
get
out
i
got
something
to
do
and
i
ca
be
bothered
the
visitors
grumbled
there
true
hospitality
for
you
objected
they
turn
your
best
friends
out
into

james
unmoved
got
an
inspiration
get
out

they
went
grumbling
loudly
down
the
length
of
the
stairs
to
the
disgust
of
the
lady
with
the
piano
on
the
floor
below
what
you
up
to
anyway
jimmie
inquired
the
brother
with
some
curiosity
james
had
swept
a
space
clear
on
the
table
and
was
arranging
some
stationery
do
you
care
he
replied
you
just
sit
down
and
read
your
little
omar
for
a
while
he
plunged
into
the
labours
of
composition
and
bert
sat
smoking
meditatively
after
some
moments
the
writer
passed
a
letter
over
to
the
smoker

inquired
bert
read
the
letter
through
carefully
jeems
said
he
after
due
deliberation
jeems

james

that
i
can
tell
you
he
tramped
down
four
flights
and
to
the
corner
although
it
was
midnight
and
bitter
cold
then
with
a
seraphic
grin
on
his
countenance
he
went
to

and
slept

sleep

chapter
ii
the
west
when
a
man
is
and
has
had
no
experience
and
graduates
from
a
small
college
where
he
roomed
alone
in
splendour
and
possesses
a
gift
of
words
and
a
certain
delight
in
reading
and
is
thrown
into
new
and
to
him
romantic
surroundings
when
all
these
stars
of
chance
cross
their
orbits
he
begins
to
write
a
novel
the
novel
never
has
anything
to
do
with
the
aforesaid
new
and
romantic
surroundings
neither
has
it
the
faintest
connection
with
anything
the
author
has
ever
seen
that
would
limit
his
imagination
once
he
was
well
settled
in
his
new
home
and
the
first
excitement
of
novel
impressions
had
worn
off
bennington
de
laney
began
to
write
regularly
three
hours
a
day
he
did
his
scribbling
with
a
fountain
pen
on
typewriter
paper
and
left
a
broad
margin
just
as
he
had
seen
brooks
do
in
it
he
experienced
above
all
a
delightful
feeling
of
power
he
enjoyed
to
the
full
his
ability
to
swing
gorgeous
involved
sentences
phrase
after
phrase
down
the
long
arc
of
rhetoric
without
a
pause
without
a
quiver
until
they
rushed
unhasting
up
the
other
slope
to
end
in
beautiful
words
polysyllabic
but
with
just
the
right
number
of
syllables
interspersed
were
short
sentences
he
counted
the
words
in
one
or
the
other
of
these
two
sorts
carefully
noting
the
relations
they
bore
to
each
other
on
occasions
he
despaired
because
they
did
not
bear
the
right
relations
and
he
also
dragged
out
squirming
the
and
latin
derivations
and
set
them
up
in
a
row
that
he
might
observe
their
respective
numbers
he
was
uneasily
conscious
that
he
ought
in
the
dread
of
college
anathema
to
use
the
former
but
he
loved
the
crash
or
modulated
music
of
the
latter
also
there
was
the
question
of
getting
variety
into
his
paragraph
lengths
it
was
all
excellent
practice
and
yet
this
technique
absorbing
as
it
was
counted
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
the
method
was
talent
the
was
genius
and
genius
had
evolved
an
idea
which
no
one
had
ever
thought
of
before
something
brand
new
under
the
sun
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
idea
symbolized
a
great
truth
one
department
the
more
impersonal
of
bennington
critical
faculty
assured
him
that
the
idea
would
take
rank
with
the
ideas
of
plato
and
emerson
emerson
bennington
worshipped
plato
he
also
worshipped
because
emerson
told
him
to
he
had
never
read
plato
himself
the
other
the
more
personal
and
modest
however
had
perforce
to
doubt
this
not
because
it
doubted
the
idea
but
because
bennington
was
not
naturally
conceited
to
settle
the
discrepancy
he
began
to
write
he
laid
the
scene
in
arabia
and
decided
to
call
it
a
romance
of
all
because
he
liked
the
smooth
easy
flow
of
the
syllables
the
consciousness
that
he
could
do
all
this
his
wild
western
experiences
which
otherwise
might
have
been
a
little
disagreeable
he
could
comfort
himself
with
the
reflection
that
he
was
superior
if
ridiculous
in
spots
he
was
certainly
the
latter
the
locality
into
which
his
destinies
had
led
him
lay
in
the
tumultuous
centre
of
the
hills
about
thirty
miles
from
custer
and
ten
from
hill
city
spanish
gulch
was
three
miles
down
the
draw
the
holy
smoke
mine
to
which
bennington
was
accredited
he
found
to
consist
of
a
hole
in
the
ground
of
unsounded
depth
two
log
structures
and
a
chicken
coop
the
log
structures
resembled
those
he
had
read
about
in
one
of
them
lived
arthur
and
his
wife
the
wife
did
the
cooking
arthur
did
nothing
at
all
but
sit
in
the
shade
and
smoke
a
pipe
and
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
did
not
look
like
a
loafer
he
had
no
official
connection
with
the
place
except
that
of
husband
to
arthur
the
other
member
of
the
community
was
davidson
alias
old
mizzou
the
latter
was
cordial
and
voluble
as
he
was
blessed
with
a
long
white
beard
of
the
patriarchal
type
he
inspired
confidence
he
used
exclusively
the
present
tense
and
chewed
tobacco
he
also
played
interminable
cribbage
likewise
he
talked
the
latter
was
his
strong
point
bennington
found
that
within
two
days
of
his
arrival
he
knew
all
about
the
company
business
without
having
proved
the
necessity
of
stirring
foot
on
his
own
behalf
the
claims
were
not
worth
much
according
to
old
mizzou
the
company
had
been
cheated
they
would
find
it
out
some
day
none
of
the
ore
assayed
very
high
for
his
part
he
did
not
see
why
they
even
did
assessment
work
bennington
was
to
look
after
the
latter
all
in
good
time
you
know
you
had
until
the
end
of
the
year
to
do
it
what
else
was
there
to
do
nothing
much
the
present
holders
had
come
into
the
property
on
a
foreclosed
mortgage
and
were
doing
anything
to
develop
it
yet
did
bennington
know
of
their
plans
no
well
it
looked
as
though
the
two
of
them
were
to
have
a
pretty
easy
time
of
it
did
it
old
mizzou
tried
by
adroit
questioning
to
find
out
just
why
de
laney
had
been
sent
west
there
was
in
reality
not
enough
to
keep
one
man
busy
and
surely
old
mizzou
considered
himself
quite
competent
to
attend
to
that
finally
he
concluded
that
it
must
be
to
watch
him
old
mizzou
acting
on
that
supposition
he
tried
a
new
tack
for
two
delicious
hours
he
showed
up
to
his
own
satisfaction
bennington
ignorance
of
mining
that
was
an
easy
enough
task
bennington
did
not
even
know
what
was
all
he
succeeded
in
eliciting
confirmed
him
in
the
impression
that
de
laney
was
sent
to
spy
on
him
but
why
de
laney
old
mizzou
wagged
his
gray
beard
and
why
spy
on
him
what
could
the
company
want
to
know
he
gave
it
up
one
thing
alone
was
clear
this
young
man
understanding
of
his
duties
was
very
simple
bennington
imagined
he
was
expected
to
see
certain
assessment
work
done
whatever
that
was
and
was
to
find
out
what
he
could
about
the
value
of
the
property
as
a
matter
of
sedulously
concealed
truth
he
was
really
expected
to
do
nothing
at
all
the
place
had
been
made
for
him
through
de
influence
because
he
wanted
to
go
west
now
my
boy
bishop
the
mining
capitalist
had
said
when
bennington
had
visited
him
in
his
new
york
office
do
you
know
anything
about
mining
no
sir
bennington
replied
well
that
does
matter
much
we
do
expect
to
do
anything
in
the
way
of
development
the
case
briefly
is
this
we
bought
this
busted
proposition
of
the
people
who
were
handling
it
and
have
assumed
their
debt
they
did
run
it
right
they
had
a
sort
of
a
wildcat
individual
in
charge
of
the
thing
and
he
got
contracts
for
sinking
shafts
with
all
the
turtlebacks
out
there
and
then
did
pay
for
them
now
what
we
want
you
to
do
is
this
first
of
all
you
to
take
charge
financially
at
that
end
of
the
line
that
means
paying
the
local
debts
as
we
send
you
the
money
and
looking
after
whatever
expenditures
may
become
necessary
then
you
have
to
attend
to
the
assessment
work
do
you
know
what
assessment
work
is
no
sir
well
in
order
to
hold
the
various
claims
legally
the
owners
have
to
do
one
hundred
dollars
worth
of
work
a
year
on
each
claim
if
the
work
is
done
the
claims
can
be
you
have
to
hire
the
men
buy
the
supplies
and
see
that
the
full
amount
is
done
we
have
a
man
out
there
named
davidson
you
can
rely
on
him
and
he
help
you
out
in
all
practical
matters
he
a
good
enough
practical
miner
but
he
useless
in
bossing
a
job
or
handling
money
between
you
you
ought
to
get
along
i
try
anyway
that
right
then
another
thing
you
can
put
in
your
spare
time
investigating
what
the
thing
is
worth
i
do
expect
much
from
you
in
that
respect
for
you
have
had
enough
experience
but
do
the
best
you
can
it
be
good
practice
anyway
hunt
up
davidson
go
over
all
the
claims
find
out
how
the
lead
runs
and
how
it
holds
out
get
samples
and
ship
them
to
me
investigate
everything
you
can
and
be
afraid
to
write
when
you
stuck
in
other
words
bennington
was
to
hold
the
ends
of
the
reins
while
some
one
else
drove
but
he
did
not
know
that
he
felt
his
responsibility
as
to
the
assessment
work
old
mizzou
had
already
assured
him
there
was
no
immediate
hurry
men
were
cheaper
in
the
fall
as
to
investigating
he
started
in
on
that
at
once
he
and
davidson
climbed
down
shafts
and
broke
off
ore
and
worked
the
gold
pan
it
was
fun
in
the
morning
bennington
decided
to
work
from
seven
until
ten
on
then
for
three
hours
he
and
old
mizzou
prospected
in
the
afternoon
the
young
man
took
a
vacation
and
hunted
wild
western
adventures
it
may
as
well
be
remarked
here
that
bennington
knew
all
about
the
west
before
he
left
home
until
this
excursion
he
had
never
even
crossed
the
alleghanies
but
he
thought
he
appreciated
the
conditions
thoroughly
this
was
because
he
was
young
he
could
close
his
eyes
and
see
the
cowboys
scouring
the
plain
as
a
parenthesis
it
should
be
noted
that
cowboys
always
scour
the
plain
just
as
sailors
always
scan
the
horizon
he
knew
how
the
cowboys
looked
because
he
had
seen
buffalo
bill
show
and
he
knew
how
they
talked
because
he
had
read
accurate
authors
of
the
school
of
bret
harte
he
could
even
imagine
the
romantic
mountain
maidens
with
his
preconceived
notions
the
country
in
most
particulars
tallied
interestingly
at
first
bennington
frequented
the
little
town
down
the
draw
it
answered
fairly
well
to
the
descriptions
but
proved
a
bit
lively
for
him
the
first
day
they
lent
him
a
horse
the
horse
looked
sleepy
it
took
him
twenty
minutes
to
get
on
the
animal
and
twenty
seconds
to
fall
off
there
was
an
audience
they
made
him
purchase
strange
drinks
at
outlandish
prices
after
that
they
shot
holes
all
around
his
feet
to
induce
him
to
dance
he
had
inherited
an
obstinate
streak
from
some
of
his
forebears
and
declined
when
it
went
that
far
they
then
did
other
things
to
him
which
were
not
pleasant
most
of
these
pranks
seemed
to
have
been
instigated
by
a
laughing
young
man
named
fay
fay
had
clear
blue
eyes
which
seemed
always
to
mock
you
he
could
think
up
more
diabolical
schemes
in
ten
minutes
than
the
rest
of
the
men
in
as
many
hours
bennington
came
shortly
to
hate
this
man
fay
his
attentions
had
so
much
of
the
gratuitous
for
a
number
of
days
even
after
the
enjoyment
of
novelty
had
worn
off
the
easterner
returned
bravely
to
spanish
gulch
every
afternoon
for
the
mail
it
was
a
matter
of
pride
with
him
he
did
not
like
to
be
bluffed
out
but
fay
was
always
there
tender
the
latter
would
shriek
joyously
and
bear
down
on
the
shrinking
de
laney
that
would
bring
out
the
loafers
it
all
had
to
happen
over
again
bennington
hoped
that
this
performance
would
cease
in
time
it
never
did
by
a
mental
process
unnecessary
to
trace
here
he
modified
his
first
views
and
permitted
old
mizzou
to
get
the
mail
spanish
gulch
saw
him
no
more
after
all
it
was
quite
as
good
western
experience
to
wander
in
the
hills
he
did
not
regret
the
other
in
fact
as
he
cast
in
review
his
research
in
wild
west
literature
he
perceived
that
the
incidents
of
his
town
visits
were
the
proper
thing
he
would
not
have
had
them
different
to
look
back
on
they
were
inspiring
to
write
home
about
he
recognised
all
the
types
the
miner
the
gambler
the
the
bad
man
the
cowboy
the
prospector
just
as
though
they
had
stepped
living
from
the
pages
of
his
classics
they
had
the
true
slouch
they
used
the
picturesque
language
the
log
cabins
squared
with
his
ideas
the
broncos
even
exceeded
them
but
now
he
had
seen
it
all
there
is
no
sense
in
draining
an
agreeable
cup
to
satiety
he
was
quite
content
to
enjoy
his
rambles
in
the
hills
like
the
healthy
youngster
he
was
but
had
he
seen
it
all
on
reflection
he
acknowledged
he
could
not
make
this
statement
to
himself
with
a
full
consciousness
of
sincerity
one
thing
was
lacking
from
the
preconceived
picture
his
imagination
had
drawn
there
had
been
no
mountain
flowers
by
that
he
meant
girls
every
one
knows
what
a
western
girl
is
she
is
a
beautiful
creature
always
with
clear
tanned
skin
bright
eyes
and
curly
hair
she
wears
a
tam
o
shanter
she
rides
a
horse
also
she
talks
deliciously
in
a
silver
voice
about
old
pards
altogether
a
charming
vision
in
books
this
vision
bennington
had
not
yet
realized
the
rest
of
the
west
came
up
to
specifications
but
this
one
essential
failed
in
spanish
gulch
he
had
to
be
sure
encountered
a
number
of
girls
but
they
were
and
there
a
tam
o
shanter
in
the
lot
plainly
servants
bennington
thought
the
mountain
flower
must
have
gone
on
a
visit
come
to
think
of
it
there
never
was
more
than
one
mountain
flower
to
a
town
chapter
iii
bennington
hunts
for
gold
and
finds
a
kiss
one
day
old
mizzou
brought
him
a
map
this
map
said
he
spreading
it
out
under
his
stubby
fingers
shows
the
deestrict
i
gets
it
of
fay
so
you
gains
an
idee
of
th
lay
of
the
land
a
whole
lot
them
claims
marked
with
a
crost
belongs
to
company
you
kin
take
her
and
explore
this
struck
bennington
as
an
excellent
idea
he
sat
down
at
the
table
and
counted
the
crosses
there
were
fourteen
of
them
the
different
lodes
were
laid
off
in
mathematically
exact
rectangles
running
in
many
directions
a
few
joined
one
another
but
most
lay
isolated
their
relative
positions
were
a
trifle
confusing
at
first
but
after
a
little
earnest
study
bennington
thought
he
understood
them
he
could
start
with
the
holy
smoke
just
outside
the
door
the
john
logan
lay
beyond
at
an
obtuse
angle
then
a
jump
of
a
hundred
yards
or
so
to
the
southwest
would
bring
him
to
the
crazy
horse
this
he
resolved
to
locate
for
it
was
said
to
be
on
the
same
lode
as
a
big
strike
some
one
had
recently
made
he
picked
up
his
rifle
and
set
out
now
a
map
maker
has
undoubtedly
accurate
ideas
as
to
points
of
the
compass
and
faultless
proficiency
in
depicting
views
but
he
neglects
entirely
the
putting
in
of
various
ups
and
down
slants
and
windings
of
the
country
which
apparently
twist
the
north
pole
around
to
the
you
start
due
west
on
a
bee
line
according
to
directions
after
about
ten
feet
you
scramble
over
a
fallen
tree
skirt
a
boulder
dip
into
a
ravine
and
climb
a
ledge
your
starting
point
is
out
of
sight
behind
you
your
destination
is
heaven
knows
where
in
front
by
the
time
you
have
walked
six
thousand
actual
feet
which
is
as
near
as
you
can
guess
to
fifteen
hundred
theoretical
level
ones
your
little
blazed
stake
in
a
pile
of
stones
is
likely
to
be
almost
anywhere
within
a
liberal
quarter
of
a
mile
then
it
is
if
the
hill
is
pretty
thickly
staked
out
the
chase
becomes
exciting
in
the
middle
distance
you
see
a
post
you
clamber
eagerly
to
it
only
to
find
that
it
marks
your
neighbour
claim
you
have
lost
your
standpoint
of
a
moment
ago
and
must
start
afresh
in
an
hour
time
you
have
discovered
every
stake
on
the
hill
but
the
one
you
want
in
two
hours
time
you
are
staggering
homeward
a
gibbering
idiot
then
you
are
brought
back
to
profane
sanity
by
falling
at
full
length
over
the
very
object
of
your
search
bennington
was
treated
to
full
measure
of
this
experience
he
found
the
john
logan
lode
without
much
difficulty
and
followed
its
length
with
less
for
the
simple
reason
that
its
course
lay
over
the
round
brow
of
a
hill
bare
of
trees
he
also
discovered
the
northeast
corner
of
the
crazy
horse
lode
plainly
marked
on
the
white
surface
of
a
pine
stake
braced
upright
in
a
pile
of
rocks
thence
he
confidently
paced
south
and
found
nothing
next
trip
he
came
across
pencilled
directions
concerning
the
miner
dream
lode
the
time
after
he
ran
against
the
golden
ball
and
the
golden
chain
lodes
bennington
reflected
his
mind
was
becoming
a
little
heated
it
because
i
went
around
those
ledges
and
boulders
he
said
to
himself
i
got
off
the
straight
line
this
time
i
take
the
straight
line
and
keep
it
so
he
addressed
himself
to
the
surmounting
of
obstructions
work
of
that
sort
is
not
easy
at
one
point
he
lost
his
hold
on
a
broad
steep
rock
and
slid
ungracefully
to
the
foot
of
it
his
elbows
digging
frantically
into
the
moss
and
his
legs
straddled
apart
as
he
struck
bottom
he
imagined
he
heard
a
most
delicious
little
laugh
so
real
was
the
illusion
that
he
gripped
two
handfuls
of
moss
and
looked
about
sharply
but
of
course
saw
nothing
the
laugh
was
repeated
he
looked
again
and
so
became
aware
of
a
vision
in
pink
standing
just
in
front
of
a
big
pine
above
him
on
the
hill
and
surveying
him
with
mischievous
eyes
surprise
froze
him
his
legs
straddled
his
hat
on
one
side
his
mouth
open
the
vision
began
to
pick
its
way
down
the
hill
eyeing
him
the
while
that
dancing
scrutiny
seemed
to
mesmerize
him
he
was
enchanted
to
perfect
stillness
but
he
was
graciously
permitted
to
take
in
the
particulars
of
the
girl
appearance
she
was
dainty
every
posture
of
her
slight
figure
was
of
an
airy
grace
as
light
and
delicate
as
that
of
a
rose
tendril
swaying
in
the
wind
even
when
she
tripped
over
a
loose
rock
she
caught
her
balance
again
with
a
pretty
little
uplift
of
the
hand
as
she
approached
slowly
and
evidently
not
unwilling
to
allow
her
charms
full
time
in
which
to
work
bennington
could
see
that
her
face
was
delicately
made
but
as
to
the
details
he
could
not
judge
clearly
because
of
her
mischievous
eyes
they
were
large
and
wide
and
clear
and
of
a
most
peculiar
colour
a
of
the
shade
one
sometimes
finds
in
flowers
but
only
in
the
flowers
of
a
deep
and
shady
wood
in
this
wonderful
colour
which
seemed
to
borrow
the
richness
of
its
hue
rather
from
its
depth
than
from
any
pigment
of
its
own
just
as
beyond
soundings
the
ocean
changes
from
green
to
blue
an
hundred
moods
seem
to
rise
slowly
from
within
to
swim
visible
even
though
the
mere
expression
of
her
face
gave
no
sign
of
them
for
instance
at
the
present
moment
her
features
were
composed
to
the
utmost
gravity
yet
in
her
eyes
bubbled
gaiety
and
fun
as
successive
of
a
spring
or
rather
as
the
riffles
of
sunlight
and
wind
or
the
pictured
flight
of
birds
across
a
pool
whose
surface
alone
is
stirred
bennington
realized
suddenly
with
overwhelming
fervency
that
he
preferred
to
slide
in
solitude
the
vision
in
the
starched
pink
gingham
now
poised
above
him
like
a
over
a
flower
from
behind
her
back
she
withdrew
one
hand
in
the
hand
was
the
missing
claim
stake
is
this
what
you
are
looking
for
she
inquired
demurely
the
mesmeric
spell
broke
and
bennington
was
permitted
to
babble
incoherencies
she
stamped
her
foot
is
this
what
you
looking
for
she
persisted
bennington
chaos
had
not
yet
crystallized
to
relevancy
did
you
get
it
he
stammered
again
is
this
what
you
looking
for
she
demanded
in
very
large
capitals
the
young
man
regained
control
of
his
faculties
with
an
effort
yes
it
is
he
rejoined
sharply
and
then
with
the
instinct
that
bids
us
appreciate
the
extent
of
our
relief
by
passing
an
annoyance
along
do
you
know
it
a
penal
offence
to
disturb
claim
stakes
he
had
suddenly
discovered
that
he
preferred
to
find
claim
stakes
on
claims
the
vision
eyes
opened
wider
it
must
be
nice
to
know
so
much
said
she
in
reverent
admiration
bennington
flushed
as
a
de
laney
the
girls
he
had
known
had
always
taken
him
seriously
he
disliked
being
made
fun
of
this
is
nonsense
he
objected
with
some
impatience
i
must
know
where
it
came
from
in
the
background
of
his
consciousness
still
whirled
the
moil
of
his
wonder
and
bewilderment
he
clung
to
the
claim
stake
as
a
stable
object
the
vision
looked
straight
at
him
without
winking
and
those
wonderful
eyes
filled
with
tears
yet
underneath
their
mist
seemed
to
sparkle
little
points
of
light
as
wavelets
through
a
vapour
which
veils
the
surface
of
the
sea
bennington
became
because
of
the
tears
and
still
he
owned
an
uneasy
suspicion
that
they
were
not
real
i
so
sorry
she
said
contritely
after
a
moment
i
thought
i
was
helping
you
so
much
i
found
that
stake
just
streaking
it
over
the
top
of
the
hill
it
had
got
loose
and
was
running
away
the
mist
had
cleared
up
very
suddenly
and
the
sparkles
of
fun
were
chasing
each
other
rapidly
as
though
impelled
by
a
lively
breeze
i
thought
you
be
ever
so
grateful
and
instead
of
that
you
scold
me
i
do
believe
i
like
you
a
bit
she
looked
him
over
reflectively
as
though
making
up
her
mind
bennington
laughed
outright
and
scrambled
to
his
feet
you
are
absolutely
incorrigible
he
exclaimed
to
cover
his
confusion
at
his
change
of
face
her
eyes
fairly
danced
oh
what
a
word
she
cried
rapturously
what
it
mean
something
nice
or
i
sure
you
would
have
said
it
about
me
you
the
eyes
suddenly
became
grave
oh
please
tell
me
she
begged
appealingly
bennington
was
thrown
into
confusion
at
this
for
he
did
not
know
whether
she
was
serious
or
not
he
could
do
nothing
but
stammer
and
get
red
and
think
what
a
ridiculous
ass
he
was
making
of
himself
he
might
have
considered
the
help
he
was
getting
in
that
well
then
you
need
she
conceded
magnanimously
after
a
moment
only
you
ought
not
to
say
things
about
girls
that
you
do
dare
tell
them
in
plain
language
if
you
will
say
nice
things
about
me
you
might
as
well
say
them
so
i
can
understand
them
only
i
do
think
it
a
little
early
in
our
acquaintance
this
cast
bennington
still
more
in
perplexity
he
had
a
notion
that
he
was
being
ridiculed
but
concerning
this
just
a
last
grain
of
doubt
remained
she
rattled
on
well
said
she
impatiently
why
do
you
say
something
why
you
take
this
stick
i
do
want
it
men
are
so
stupid
that
last
remark
has
been
made
many
many
times
and
yet
it
never
fails
of
its
effect
which
is
at
once
to
invest
the
speaker
with
daintiness
indescribable
and
to
thrust
the
man
addressed
into
nether
inferiority
bennington
fell
to
its
charm
he
took
the
stake
where
does
it
belong
he
asked
she
pointed
silently
to
a
pile
of
stones
he
deposited
the
stake
in
its
proper
place
and
returned
to
find
her
seated
on
the
ground
plucking
a
handful
of
the
leaves
of
a
little
erect
herb
that
grew
abundantly
in
the
hollow
these
she
rubbed
together
and
held
to
her
face
inside
the
sunbonnet
who
are
you
anyway
asked
bennington
abruptly
as
he
returned
d
you
ever
see
this
before
she
inquired
irrelevantly
looking
up
with
her
eyes
as
she
leaned
over
the
handful
good
for
colds
makes
your
nose
feel
all
funny
and
prickly
she
turned
her
hands
over
and
began
to
drop
the
leaves
one
by
one
bennington
caught
himself
watching
her
with
fascinated
interest
in
silence
he
began
to
find
this
one
of
her
most
potent
charms
the
faculty
of
translating
into
a
grace
so
exquisite
as
almost
to
realize
the
fabled
poetry
of
motion
the
least
shrug
of
her
shoulders
the
smallest
crook
of
her
finger
the
slightest
toss
of
her
small
head
she
looked
up
want
to
smell
she
inquired
and
held
out
her
hands
with
a
pretty
gesture
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
bennington
stepped
forward
obediently
and
stooped
over
the
two
little
palms
held
a
single
crushed
bit
of
the
herb
in
their
cup
they
were
soft
pink
little
palms
all
wrinkled
like
crumpled
rose
leaves
bennington
stooped
to
smell
the
herb
instead
he
kissed
the
palms
the
girl
sprang
to
her
feet
with
one
indignant
motion
and
faced
him
the
eyes
now
flashed
blue
flame
and
bennington
for
the
first
time
noticed
what
had
escaped
him
before
that
the
forehead
was
broad
and
thoughtful
and
that
above
it
the
hair
instead
of
being
blonde
and
curly
and
sparkling
with
golden
radiance
was
of
a
peculiar
wavy
brown
that
seemed
sometimes
full
of
light
and
sometimes
lustreless
and
black
according
as
it
caught
the
direct
rays
of
the
sun
or
not
then
he
appreciated
his
offence
sir
she
exclaimed
and
turned
away
with
a
haughty
shoulder
and
we
never
been
introduced
she
said
half
to
herself
but
her
face
was
now
concealed
so
that
bennington
could
not
see
she
laughed
she
marched
stiffly
down
the
hill
bennington
turned
to
follow
her
although
the
action
was
entirely
mechanical
and
he
had
no
definite
idea
in
doing
so
do
you
dare
sir
she
cried
so
he
did
not
dare
this
vexed
her
for
a
moment
then
having
gone
quite
out
of
sight
she
sank
down
and
laughed
until
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
i
did
think
he
knew
enough
she
said
with
a
final
hysterical
chuckle
this
first
impression
of
the
mountain
flower
bennington
would
have
been
willing
to
acknowledge
was
quite
complicated
enough
but
he
was
destined
to
further
surprises
when
he
returned
to
the
holy
smoke
camp
he
found
old
mizzou
in
earnest
conversation
with
a
stranger
whose
hand
he
was
promptly
requested
to
shake
the
stranger
was
a
tall
scraggly
individual
dressed
in
the
usual
flannel
shirt
and
blue
jeans
the
latter
tucked
into
rusty
cowhide
boots
bennington
was
interested
in
him
because
he
was
so
phenomenally
ugly
from
the
collar
of
his
shirt
projected
a
lean
sinewy
neck
on
which
the
skin
rolled
and
wrinkled
in
a
dark
red
manner
particularly
disagreeable
to
behold
the
neck
supported
a
small
head
the
face
was
wizened
and
tanned
to
a
dark
mahogany
colour
it
was
ornamented
with
a
grizzled
goatee
the
man
smoked
a
stub
pipe
his
remarks
were
emphasized
by
the
gestures
of
a
huge
and
gnarled
pair
of
hands
lawton
is
from
old
mizzou
too
afore
he
moved
to
illinoy
commented
davidson
one
became
aware
from
the
loving
tones
in
which
he
pronounced
the
two
words
whence
he
derived
his
sobriquet
lawton
expressed
the
opinion
that
chillicothe
of
that
state
was
the
finest
town
on
top
of
earth
bennington
presumed
it
might
be
and
then
opportunely
bethought
him
of
a
bottle
of
canadian
club
which
among
other
necessary
articles
he
had
brought
with
him
from
new
york
this
he
produced
the
old
missourians
brightened
davidson
went
into
the
cabin
after
glasses
and
a
corkscrew
he
found
the
corkscrew
all
right
but
apparently
had
some
difficulty
in
regard
to
the
glasses
they
could
hear
him
calling
vociferously
for
arthur
arthur
had
gone
to
the
spring
for
water
in
a
few
moments
old
mizzou
appeared
in
the
doorway
exceedingly
red
of
face
consarn
them
women
folks
he
grumbled
depositing
the
tin
cups
on
the
porch
they
locks
up
an
conceals
things
most
damnable
ai
a
tumbler
in
th
place
these
yar
is
all
right
assured
lawton
consolingly
picking
up
one
of
the
cups
and
examining
the
bottom
of
it
with
great
care
i
reckon
they
hold
the
likker
anyhow
agreed
davidson
they
passed
the
bottle
politely
to
de
laney
and
the
latter
helped
himself
for
his
part
he
was
glad
the
tin
cups
had
been
necessary
for
it
enabled
him
to
conceal
the
smallness
of
his
dose
lawton
filled
his
own
up
to
the
brim
davidson
followed
suit
here
how
observed
the
latter
and
the
two
old
turtlebacks
drank
the
raw
whisky
down
near
a
half
pint
of
it
as
though
it
had
been
so
much
milk
bennington
fairly
gasped
with
astonishment
do
you
ever
take
any
water
he
asked
they
turned
slowly
old
mizzou
looked
him
in
the
eye
with
glimmering
reproach
not
if
th
whisky
good
sonny
said
he
impressively
wall
commented
lawton
after
a
pause
that
is
a
good
drink
reckon
i
must
be
goin
stay
t
grub
urged
old
mizzou
heartily
folks
waitin
remember
they
looked
at
bennington
and
chuckled
a
little
to
that
young
discomfort
lawton
a
damn
fine
fella
said
old
mizzou
with
emphasis
bennington
thought
with
a
shudder
of
the
neck
and
was
silent
after
supper
bennington
and
old
mizzou
played
cribbage
by
the
light
of
a
kerosene
lamp
while
i
was
hunting
claims
this
afternoon
said
the
easterner
suddenly
i
ran
across
a
mighty
pretty
girl
yas
observed
old
mizzou
with
indifference
what
fer
a
gal
was
it
she
did
look
as
if
she
belonged
around
here
she
was
a
slender
girl
very
pretty
with
a
pink
dress
on
ai
no
female
strangers
blue
eyes
yes
an
that
sometimes
looks
black
an
sometimes
yes
that
the
one
all
right

said
old
mizzou
with
slight
interest
that
bill
lawton
girl
live
down
th
gulch
he
th
fella
that
was
yar
afore

he
explained
for
a
full
minute
bennington
stared
at
the
cards
in
his
hand
the
patriarch
became
impatient
yore
play
sonny
he
suggested
i
do
believe
you
know
the
one
i
mean
returned
bennington
slowly
she
a
girl
with
a
little
mouth
and
a
nose
that
is
tipped
up
just
a
trifle
snub
interrupted
old
mizzou
with
some
impatience
yas

critter

like
her

all
over
scenery

said
bennington
still
more
slowly
wall
so
mis
lawton
sez
chuckled
mizzou
that
night
bennington
lay
awake
for
some
time
he
had
discovered
the
mountain
flower
the
west
was
complete
at
last
but
he
had
offended
his
discovery
what
was
the
etiquette
in
such
a
case
back
east
he
would
have
felt
called
upon
to
apologize
for
being
rude
then
at
the
thought
of
apologizing
to
a
daughter
of
that
old
he
had
to
laugh

the
sun
fairy
the
next
afternoon
after
the
day
writing
and
prospecting
were
finished
bennington
resolved
to
go
deer
hunting
he
had
skipped
thirteen
chapters
of
his
work
to
describe
the
heroine
rhoda
she
had
wonderful
eyes
and
was
i
believe
dressed
in
a
garment
whose
colour
was
pink
keep
yore
moccasins
greased
old
mizzou
advised
at
parting
by
which
he
meant
that
the
young
man
was
to
step
softly
this
he
found
to
be
difficult
his
course
lay
along
the
top
of
the
ridge
where
the
obstructions
were
many
there
were
outcrops
boulders
ravines
broken
twigs
old
leaves
and
dikes
all
of
which
had
to
be
surmounted
or
avoided
they
were
all
aggravating
but
the
dikes
possessed
some
intellectual
interest
which
the
others
lacked
a
dike
be
it
understood
is
a
hole
in
the
earth
made
visible
that
is
to
say
in
old
days
when
mountains
were
much
loftier
than
they
are
now
various
agencies
brought
it
to
pass
that
they
split
and
cracked
and
yawned
down
to
the
innermost
cores
of
their
being
in
such
hideous
fashion
that
chasms
and
holes
of
great
depth
and
perpendicularity
were
opened
in
them
thereupon
the
interior
fires
were
released
and
these
vomiting
up
a
vast
supply
of
molten
material
filled
said
chasms
and
holes
to
the
very
brim
the
molten
material
cooled
into
rock
the
rains
descended
and
the
snows
melted
under
their
erosive
influence
the
original
mountains
were
cut
down
somewhat
but
the
erstwhile
molten
material
being
as
we
have
said
wasted
very
little
or
not
at
all
and
as
a
consequence
stands
forth
above
its
present
surroundings
in
exact
mould
of
the
ancient
cracks
or
holes
now
some
dikes
are
long
and
narrow
others
are
short
and
wide
and
still
others
are
nearly
round
all
however
are
highest
points
and
head
and
shoulders
above
the
trees
look
abroad
over
the
land
when
bennington
came
to
one
of
these
dikes
he
was
forced
to
pick
his
way
carefully
in
a
detour
around
its
base
between
times
he
found
hobnails
much
inclined
to
click
against
unforeseen
stones
the
broken
twig
came
to
possess
other
than
literary
importance
after
a
little
his
nerves
asserted
themselves
unconsciously
he
relaxed
his
attention
and
began
to
think
the
subject
of
his
thoughts
was
the
girl
he
had
seen
just
hours
before
he
caught
himself
remembering
little
things
he
had
not
consciously
noticed
at
the
time
as
for
instance
the
strange
contrast
between
the
mischief
in
her
eyes
and
the
austerity
of
her
brow
or
the
queer
little
fashion
she
had
of
winking
rapidly
four
or
five
times
and
then
opening
her
eyes
wide
and
looking
straight
into
the
depths
of
his
own
he
considered
it
quite
a
coincidence
that
he
had
unconsciously
returned
to
the
spot
on
which
they
had
met
the
day
before
the
rich
crazy
horse
lode
as
though
in
answer
to
his
recognition
of
this
fact
her
voice
suddenly
called
to
him
from
above
hullo
little
boy
it
cried
he
felt
at
once
that
he
was
pleased
at
the
encounter
hullo
he
answered
where
are
you
right
here
he
looked
up
and
then
still
up
until
at
the
flat
top
of
the
castellated
dike
that
stood
over
him
he
caught
a
gleam
of
pink
the
contrast
between
it
the
blue
of
the
sky
and
the
dark
green
of
the
trees
was
most
beautiful
and
unusual
nature
rarely
uses
pink
except
in
sunsets
and
in
flowers
bennington
thought
pleasedly
how
every
impression
this
girl
made
upon
him
was
one
of
grace
or
beauty
or
bright
colour
the
gleam
of
pink
disappeared
and
a
great
pine
cone
heavy
with
pitch
came
buzzing
through
the
air
to
fall
at
his
feet
that
to
show
you
where
i
am
came
the
clear
voice
you
ought
to
feel
honoured
i
only
three
cones
left
the
dike
before
which
bennington
had
paused
was
one
of
the
round
variety
it
rose
perhaps
twenty
feet
above
the
at
its
base
sheer
gray
its
surface
almost
intact
except
for
an
insignificant
number
of
frost
fissures
from
its
base
the
hill
fell
rapidly
so
that
even
from
his
own
inferior
elevation
he
was
enabled
to
look
over
the
tops
of
trees
standing
but
a
few
rods
away
from
him
he
could
see
that
the
summit
of
this
dike
was
probably
nearly
flat
and
he
surmised
that
once
up
there
one
would
become
master
of
a
pretty
enough
little
plateau
on
which
to
sit
but
his
careful
circumvallation
could
discover
no
possible
method
of
ascent
the
walls
afforded
no
chance
for
a
squirrel
foothold
even
he
began
to
doubt
whether
he
had
guessed
aright
as
to
the
girl
whereabouts
and
began
carefully
to
examine
the
tops
of
the
trees
discovering
nothing
in
them
he
cast
another
puzzled
glance
at
the
top
of
the
dike
a
pair
of
violet
eyes
was
scrutinizing
him
gravely
over
the
edge
of
it
how
in
the
world
did
you
get
up
there
he
cried
flew
she
explained
with
great
succinctness
look
out
you
do
fall
he
warned
hastily
her
attitude
was
alarming
i
am
lying
flat
said
she
and
i
ca
fall
you
have
told
me
how
you
got
up
i
want
to
come
up
too
how
do
you
know
i
want
you
i
have
such
a
lot
of
things
to
say
cried
bennington
rather
at
a
loss
for
a
valid
reason
but
feeling
the
necessity
keenly
well
sit
down
and
say
them
there
a
big
flat
rock
just
behind
you
this
did
not
suit
him
in
the
least
i
wish
you
let
me
up
he
begged
petulantly
i
ca
say
what
i
want
from
here
i
can
hear
you
quite
well
you
have
to
talk
from
there
or
else
keep
still
that
is
fair
persisted
the
young
man
adopting
a
tone
of
argument
you
a
girl
stop
there
you
are
wrong
to
start
with
did
you
think
that
a
creature
who
could
fly
to
the
tops
of
the
rocks
was
a
mere
girl
not
at
all
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
easily
bewildered
bennington
what
i
say
i
not
a
girl
what
are
you
then
a
sun
fairy
a
sun
fairy
yes
a
real
live
one
see
that
cloud
over
toward
the
sun
the
nice
downy
one
i
mean
that
my
couch
i
sleep
on
it
all
night
i
got
it
near
the
sun
so
that
it
will
warm
up
you
see
i
see
cried
bennington
he
could
recognise
foolery
provided
it
were
ticketed
plainly
enough
he
sat
down
on
the
flat
rock
before
indicated
and
clasped
his
knee
with
his
hands
prepared
to
enjoy
more
is
that
your
throne
up
there
sun
fairy
he
asked
she
had
withdrawn
her
head
from
sight
it
is
her
voice
came
down
to
him
in
grave
tones
it
must
be
a
very
nice
one
the
nicest
throne
you
ever
saw
i
never
saw
one
but
i
often
heard
that
thrones
were
unpleasant
things
i
am
sitting
foolish
mortal
said
she
in
tones
of
deep
commiseration
on
a
soft
thick
cushion
of
moss
much
more
comfortable
i
imagine
than
hard
flat
rocks
and
the
nice
warm
sun
is
shining
on
me
it
must
be
rather
chilly
in
the
woods
and
there
is
a
breeze
blowing
from
the
big
horn
old
rocks
are
always
damp
and
stuffy
in
the
shade
and
i
am
looking
away
out
over
the
hills
i
hope
some
people
enjoy
the
sight
of
piles
of
quartzite
cruel
sun
fairy
cried
bennington
why
do
you
tantalize
me
so
with
the
delights
from
which
you
debar
me
what
have
i
done
there
was
a
short
silence
ca
you
think
of
anything
you
done
asked
the
voice
insinuatingly
bennington
memory
stirred
it
did
not
seem
so
ridiculous
under
the
direct
charm
of
the
fresh
young
voice
that
came
down
through
the
summer
air
from
above
like
a
dove
note
from
a
treetop
to
apologize
to
lawton
girl
the
incongruity
now
was
in
forcing
into
this
arcadian
incident
anything
savouring
of
conventionality
at
all
it
had
been
so
idyllic
this
talk
of
the
sun
fairy
and
the
cloud
so
like
a
passage
from
an
old
book
of
legends
this
dainty
episode
in
the
great
strong
western
breezes
under
the
great
strong
western
sky
everything
should
be
perfect
not
to
be
blamed
do
sun
fairies
accept
apologies
he
asked
presently
in
a
subdued
voice
they
might
this
particular
sun
fairy
is
offered
one
by
a
man
who
is
sorry
is
it
a
good
big
one
indeed
yes
the
head
appeared
over
the
edge
of
the
rock
inspected
him
gravely
for
a
moment
and
was
withdrawn
then
it
is
accepted
said
the
voice
thank
you
he
replied
sincerely
and
now
are
you
going
to
let
down
your
rope
ladder
or
whatever
it
is
i
really
want
to
talk
to
you
you
are
so
persistent
cried
the
petulant
voice
and
so
foolish
it
is
like
a
man
to
spoil
things
by
questionings
he
suddenly
felt
the
truth
of
this
one
can
not
talk
every
day
to
a
sun
fairy
and
the
experience
can
never
be
repeated
he
settled
back
on
the
rock
pardon
me
sun
fairy
he
cried
again
rope
ladders
indeed
to
one
who
has
but
to
close
her
eyes
and
she
finds
herself
on
a
downy
cloud
near
the
sun
my
mortality
blinded
me
now
you
are
a
nice
boy
she
approved
more
contentedly
and
as
a
reward
you
may
ask
me
one
question
all
right
he
agreed
and
then
with
instinctive
tact
what
do
you
see
up
there
he
could
hear
her
clap
her
hands
with
delight
and
he
felt
glad
that
he
had
followed
his
impulse
to
ask
just
this
question
instead
of
one
more
personal
and
more
in
line
with
his
curiosity
listen
she
began
i
see
pines
many
pines
just
the
tops
of
them
and
they
are
all
waving
in
the
breeze
did
you
ever
see
trees
from
on
top
they
are
quite
different
and
out
from
the
pines
come
great
round
hills
made
all
of
stone
i
think
they
look
like
skulls
then
there
are
breathless
descents
where
the
pines
fall
away
once
in
a
while
a
little
white
road
flashes
out
yes
urged
bennington
as
the
voice
paused
and
what
else
do
you
see
i
see
the
prairie
too
she
went
on
half
dreamily
it
is
brown
now
but
the
green
is
beginning
to
shine
through
it
just
a
very
little
and
out
beyond
there
is
a
sparkle
that
is
the
cheyenne
and
beyond
that
there
is
something
white
and
that
is
the
bad
lands
the
voice
broke
off
with
a
happy
little
laugh
bennington
saw
the
scene
as
though
it
lay
actually
spread
out
before
him
there
was
something
in
the
choice
of
the
words
clearcut
decisive
and
descriptive
but
more
in
the
exquisite
modulations
of
the
voice
adding
here
a
tint
there
a
shade
to
the
picture
and
casting
over
the
whole
that
poetic
glamour
which
rarely
is
imitated
in
grosser
materials
by
nature
herself
when
just
following
sunset
she
suffuses
the
landscape
with
a
mellow
afterglow
the
head
sunbonneted
reappeared
perked
inquiringly
sideways
hello
stranger
it
called
with
a
nasal
inflection
how
air
ye
do
y
think
minin
is
goin
t
pan
out
well
this
yar
spring
then
she
caught
sight
of
his
weapon
what
are
you
going
to
shoot
she
asked
with
sudden
interest
i
thought
i
might
see
a
deer
deer
hoh
she
cried
in
lofty
scorn
reassuming
her
nasal
tone
you
is
shore
a
tenderfoot
don
know
that
blastin
scares
all
deer
away
from
a
minin
camp
bennington
looked
confused
no
i
had
thought
of
that
he
confessed
stoutly
enough
i
kind
of
like
to
shoot
said
she
a
little
wistfully
what
sort
of
a
gun
is
it
a
savage
smokeless
answered
bennington
perfunctorily
one
of
the
inquired
the
sunbonnet
with
new
interest
yes
gasped
bennington
astonished
at
so
much
feminine
knowledge
of
firearms
oh
i
like
to
see
it
i
never
saw
any
of
those
may
i
shoot
it
just
once
of
course
you
may
more
than
once
shall
i
come
up
no
i
come
down
you
sit
right
still
on
that
rock
the
sunbonnet
disappeared
and
there
ensued
a
momentary
commotion
on
the
other
side
of
the
dike
in
an
instant
the
girl
came
around
the
corner
picking
her
way
over
the
loose
blocks
of
stone
with
the
of
either
hand
she
held
the
pink
starched
skirt
up
displaying
a
neat
little
foot
in
a
heavy
little
shoe
diagonally
across
the
skirt
ran
two
irregular
brown
stains
she
caught
him
looking
at
them
naughty
naughty
said
she
glancing
down
at
them
with
a
grimace
she
dropped
her
skirt
and
stood
up
beside
him
with
a
pretty
shake
of
the
shoulders
now
let
see
it
she
begged
she
examined
the
weapon
with
much
interest
throwing
down
and
back
the
lever
in
a
manner
that
showed
she
was
accustomed
at
least
to
the
arm
how
light
it
is
she
commented
squinting
through
the
sights
does
it
kick
awfully
not
a
bit
smokeless
powder
you
know
of
course
what
we
shoot
at
bennington
fumbled
in
his
pockets
and
produced
an
envelope
how
this
he
asked
she
seized
it
and
ran
like
an
antelope
with
the
same
motion
to
a
tree
about
thirty
paces
distant
on
which
she
pinned
the
bit
of
paper
they
shot
bennington
hit
the
paper
every
time
the
girl
missed
it
once
at
this
she
looked
a
little
vexed
you
are
either
very
rude
or
very
sincere
was
her
comment
you
the
best
shot
i
ever
saw
now
do
dare
say
a
girl
she
interrupted
quickly
what
the
prize
was
this
a
match
of
course
it
was
and
i
insist
on
paying
up
bennington
considered
i
think
i
would
like
to
go
to
the
top
of
the
rock
there
and
see
the
pines
and
the
and
the
prairies
she
glanced
toward
him
knitting
her
brows
it
is
my
very
own
she
said
doubtfully
i
never
let
anybody
go
up
there
before
one
of
the
diminutive
chipmunks
of
the
hills
scampered
out
from
a
cleft
in
the
rocks
and
perched
on
a
log
chattering
eagerly
and
jerking
his
tail
in
the
manner
of
chipmunks
oh
see
see
she
cried
all
excitement
in
a
moment
she
seized
the
rifle
and
taking
careful
aim
fired
the
chattering
ceased
the
chipmunk
disappeared
bennington
ran
to
the
log
behind
it
lay
the
little
animal
the
long
bullet
had
just
grazed
the
base
of
its
brain
he
picked
it
up
gently
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
contemplated
it
it
was
such
a
diminutive
beast
not
as
large
as
a
rat
quite
smaller
than
our
own
chipmunks
of
the
east
it
little
sides
were
daintily
striped
its
little
whiskers
were
as
perfect
as
those
of
the
great
squirrels
in
the
timber
bottom
in
its
pouches
were
the
roots
of
pine
cones
bennington
was
not
a
sentimentalist
but
the
incident
against
the
background
of
the
day
seemed
to
him
just
a
little
pathetic
something
of
the
feeling
showed
in
his
eyes
the
girl
who
had
drawn
near
looked
from
him
to
the
dead
chipmunk
and
back
again
then
she
burst
suddenly
into
tears
oh
cruel
cruel
she
sobbed
what
did
i
do
it
for
what
did
you
me
do
it
for
her
distress
was
so
keen
that
the
young
man
hastened
to
relieve
it
there
he
reassured
her
lightly
do
do
that
why
you
are
a
great
hunter
you
got
your
game
and
it
was
a
splendid
shot
we
have
him
skinned
when
we
get
back
home
and
we
cure
the
skin
and
you
can
make
something
out
of
it
a
spectacle
case
he
suggested
at
random
i
know
how
you
feel
he
went
on
to
give
her
time
to
recover
but
all
hunters
feel
that
way
occasionally
see
i
put
him
just
here
until
we
get
ready
to
go
home
where
nothing
can
get
him
he
deposited
the
squirrel
in
the
cleft
of
a
rock
quite
out
of
sight
and
stood
back
as
though
pleased
there
that
fine
he
concluded
with
one
of
those
instantaneous
transitions
which
seemed
so
natural
to
her
and
yet
which
appeared
to
reach
not
at
all
to
her
real
nature
she
had
changed
from
an
aspect
of
passionate
grief
to
one
of
solemn
inquiry
bennington
found
her
looking
at
him
with
the
soul
brimming
to
the
very
surface
of
her
great
eyes
i
think
you
may
come
up
on
my
rock
she
said
simply
after
a
moment
they
skirted
the
base
of
the
dike
together
until
they
had
reached
the
westernmost
side
there
bennington
was
shown
the
means
of
ascent
which
he
had
overlooked
before
because
of
his
too
close
examination
of
the
cliff
itself
at
a
distance
of
about
twenty
feet
from
the
dike
grew
a
large
pine
tree
the
lowest
branch
of
which
extended
directly
over
the
little
plateau
and
about
a
foot
above
it
next
to
the
large
pine
stood
two
smaller
saplings
side
by
side
and
a
few
inches
apart
these
had
been
converted
into
a
ladder
by
the
nailing
across
of
rustic
rounds
that
how
i
get
up
explained
the
girl
now
you
go
back
around
the
corner
again
and
when
i
ready
i
call
bennington
obeyed
in
a
few
moments
he
heard
again
the
voice
in
the
air
summoning
him
to
approach
and
climb
he
ascended
the
natural
ladder
easily
but
when
within
six
or
eight
feet
of
the
large
branch
that
reached
across
to
the
dike
the
smaller
of
the
two
saplings
ceased
and
so
naturally
the
ladder
terminated
hi
he
called
how
did
you
get
up
this
he
looked
across
the
intervening
space
expectantly
and
then
to
his
surprise
he
observed
that
the
girl
was
blushing
furiously
i
i
stammered
a
small
voice
after
a
moment
hesitation
i
guess
i
a
light
broke
across
bennington
mind
as
to
the
origin
of
the
two
dark
streaks
on
the
gown
and
he
laughed
the
girl
eyed
him
reproachfully
for
a
moment
or
so
then
she
too
began
to
laugh
in
an
embarrassed
manner
whereupon
bennington
laughed
the
harder
he
shinned
up
the
tree
to
find
that
an
ingenious
hand
rope
had
been
fitted
above
the
bridge
limb
so
that
the
crossing
of
the
short
interval
to
the
rock
was
a
matter
of
no
great
difficulty
in
another
instant
he
stood
upon
the
top
of
the
dike
it
was
as
he
had
anticipated
nearly
flat
under
the
pine
branch
which
might
make
a
very
good
chair
back
grew
a
thick
cushion
of
moss
the
one
tree
broke
the
freedom
of
the
eye
sweep
toward
the
west
but
in
all
other
directions
it
was
uninterrupted
as
the
girl
had
said
the
tops
of
pines
alone
met
the
view
miles
on
miles
of
them
undulating
rising
swelling
breaking
against
the
barrier
of
a
dike
or
lapping
the
foot
of
a
great
round
here
and
there
a
darker
spot
suggested
a
break
for
a
mountain
peak
rarely
a
fleck
of
white
marked
a
mountain
road
back
of
them
all
ridge
mountain
cavernous
valley
towered
old
harney
a
few
wisps
of
cloud
streaming
down
the
wind
from
his
brow
locks
heavy
with
the
age
of
the
great
manitou
whom
he
was
supposed
to
represent
eastward
the
prairie
like
a
peaceful
sea
above
the
alert
sky
of
the
west
and
through
all
the
air
a
humming
vast
murmurous
swelling
as
the
mountain
breeze
touched
simultaneously
with
strong
hand
the
chords
not
of
one
but
a
thousand
pine
harps
bennington
drew
in
a
deep
breath
and
looked
about
in
all
directions
the
girl
watched
him
ah
it
is
beautiful
he
murmured
at
last
with
a
half
sigh
and
looked
again
she
seized
his
hand
eagerly
oh
i
so
glad
you
said
that
and
no
more
than
that
she
cried
i
feel
the
sun
fairy
can
make
you
welcome
now
chapter
v
the
spirit
mountain
from
now
on
said
the
girl
shaking
out
her
skirts
before
sitting
down
i
am
going
to
be
a
mystery

are
already
replied
bennington
for
the
first
time
aware
that
such
was
the
fact

a
plain
business
proposition

make

that
thought
bennington

be
asking
all

you
this
that
i
am
living
down
the
gulch
with
my
people
i
know
mr
lawton
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
exactly
if
you
were
to
walk
straight
ahead
not
out
in
the
air
of
course
you
could
see
the
roof
of
the
house
now
after
we
know
each
other
better
the
natural
thing
for
you
to
do

be
to
come
and

my
house

bennington
agreed
that
it
would

bennington
expressed
his
astonishment

will
explain

very
little
in
a
month
occurs

pioneer
picnic
at
rapid
you
do
know
what
the
pioneer
picnic
is
ignorant
boy
it
our
most
important
event
of
the
year
well
until
that
time
i
am
going
to
try
an
experiment
i
am
going
to
see
if

going

try
an
experiment

whole
thing
to
you
after
the
pioneer
picnic
and
not
a
moment
before
are
you
curious
i
am
indeed
bennington
assured
her
sincerely
she
took
on
a
small
air
of
tyranny
now
understand
me
i
mean
what
i
say
if
you
want
to
see
me
again
you
must
do
as
i
tell
you
you
must
take
me
as
i
am
and
you
must
mind
me
bennington
cast
a
fleeting
wonder
over
the
sublime
which
made
this
girl
so
certain
he
would
care
to
see
her
again
then
with
a
grip
at
the
heart
he
owned
that
the
was
well
founded
all
right
he
assented
meekly
good
she
cried
with
a
gleam
of
mischief
behold
me
old
bill
lawton
gal
if
you
want
to
be
pards
put
her
thar
and
so
you
are
a
girl
after
all
and
no
sun
fairy
smiled
bennington
as
he
put
her
thar
my
cloud
has
melted
she
replied
quietly
pointing
toward
the
brow
of
harney
they
chatted
of
small
things
for
a
time
bennington
felt
intuitively
that
there
was
something
a
little
strange
about
this
girl
something
a
little
out
of
the
ordinary
something
he
had
never
been
conscious
of
in
any
other
girl
yet
he
could
never
seize
the
impression
and
examine
it
it
was
always
just
escaping
just
taking
shape
to
the
point
of
visibility
and
then
melting
away
again
just
rising
in
the
modulations
of
her
voice
to
a
murmur
that
the
ear
thought
to
seize
as
a
definite
chord
and
then
dying
into
a
hundred
other
cadences
he
tried
to
catch
it
in
her
eyes
where
so
much
else
was
to
be
seen
sometimes
he
perceived
its
influence
but
never
itself
it
passed
as
a
shadow
in
the
lower
deeps
as
though
the
feather
mass
of
a
great
sea
growth
had
lifted
slowly
on
an
undercurrent
and
then
as
slowly
had
sunk
back
to
its
bed
leaving
but
the
haunting
impression
of
something
shapeless
that
had
darkened
the
hue
of
the
waters
it
was
most
like
a
sadness
that
had
passed
perhaps
it
was
merely
an
unconscious
trick
of
thought
or
manner
after
a
time
she
asked
him
his
first
name
and
he
told
her
i
like
to
know
your
too
miss
lawton
he
suggested
i
wish
you
would
call
me
miss
lawton
she
cried
with
sudden
petulance
why
certainly
not
if
you
do
want
me
to
but
what
am
i
to
call
you
do
you
know
she
confided
with
a
pretty
little
gesture
i
have
always
disliked
my
real
name
it
ugly
and
horrid
i
often
wished
i
were
a
heroine
in
a
book
and
then
i
could
have
a
name
i
really
liked
now
here
a
chance
i
going
to
let
you
get
up
one
for
me
but
it
must
be
pretty
and
we
have
it
all
for
our
very
own
i
do
quite
see
objected
the
still
conventional
de
laney
your
wits
your
wits
have
you
any
wits
at
she
cried
with
impatience
over
his
unresponsiveness
well
let
me
see
it
is
easy
to
do
a
thing
like
that
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
sun
fairy
a
fairy
a
fay
is
it
i
might
call
you
fay
fay
she
repeated
in
a
startled
tone
bennington
remembered
that
this
was
the
name
of
the
young
man
who
had
lent
him
the
bucking
horse
and
frowned
no
i
do
believe
i
like
that
he
recanted
hastily
take
time
and
think
about
it
she
suggested
i
think
of
one
that
would
be
appropriate
he
said
after
some
little
time
it
is
suggested
by
that
little
bird
there
it
is
phoebe
do
you
think
it
is
appropriate
she
objected
a
phoebe
bird
or
a
phoebe
girl
always
seemed
to
me
to
be
demure
and
quiet
and
thoughtful
and
and
fond
of
dim
forests
while
i
am
a
frivolous
laughing
sunny
individual
who
likes
the
open
air
and
does
care
for
shadows
at
all
yet
i
feel
it
is
appropriate
he
insisted
he
paused
and
went
on
a
little
timidly
in
the
face
of
his
new
experience
in
giving
expression
to
the
more
subtle
feelings
i
do
know
whether
i
can
express
it
or
not
you
are
laughing
and
sunny
as
you
say
but
there
is
something
in
you
like
the
phoebe
bird
just
the
same
it
is
like
those
cloud
shadows
he
pointed
out
over
the
mountains
overhead
a
number
of
summer
clouds
were
winging
their
way
from
the
west
casting
on
the
earth
those
huge
irregular
shadows
which
sweep
across
it
so
swiftly
yet
with
such
dignity
so
rushingly
and
yet
so
harmlessly
the
hills
are
sunny
and
bright
enough
and
all
at
once
one
of
the
shadows
crosses
them
and
it
is
dark
then
in
another
moment
it
is
bright
again
and
do
you
really
see
that
in
me
she
asked
curiously
you
are
a
dear
boy
she
continued
looking
at
him
for
some
moments
with
reflective
eyes
it
wo
do
though
she
said
rising
at
last
too
i
do
know
then
he
confessed
with
some
helplessness
i
tell
you
what
i
always
to
be
called
said
she
ever
since
i
was
a
little
girl
it
is
mary
he
cried
astonished
why
it
is
such
a
common
name
it
is
a
beautiful
name
she
asserted
say
it
over
are
the
syllables
soft
and
musical
and
caressing
it
is
a
lovely
name
why
i
remember
she
went
on
vivaciously
a
girl
who
was
named
mary
and
who
did
like
it
when
she
came
to
our
school
she
changed
it
but
she
did
dare
to
break
it
to
the
family
all
at
once
the
first
letter
home
she
signed
herself
her
father
wrote
back
dear
daughter
if
the
name
of
the
mother
of
jesus
is
good
enough
for
you
come
home
she
laughed
at
the
recollection
then
you
have
been
away
to
school
asked
the
young
man
yes
she
replied
shortly
she
adroitly
led
him
to
talk
of
himself
he
told
her
naively
of
new
york
and
tennis
of
brake
parties
and
clubs
and
even
afternoon
teas
and
balls
all
of
which
of
course
interested
a
western
girl
exceedingly
in
this
it
so
happened
that
his
immaturity
showed
more
plainly
than
before
he
did
not
boast
openly
but
he
introduced
extraneous
details
important
in
themselves
he
mentioned
knowing
pennington
the
painter
and
brookes
the
writer
merely
in
a
casual
fashion
but
with
just
the
faintest
flourish
it
somehow
became
known
that
his
family
had
a
crest
that
his
position
was
high
in
short
that
he
was
a
de
laney
on
both
sides
he
liked
to
tell
it
to
this
girl
because
it
was
evidently
fresh
and
new
to
her
and
because
in
the
presence
of
her
inexperience
in
these
matters
he
gained
a
confidence
in
himself
which
he
had
never
dared
assume
before
she
looked
straight
in
front
of
her
and
listened
throwing
in
a
comment
now
and
then
to
assist
the
stream
of
his
talk
at
last
when
he
fell
silent
she
reached
swiftly
out
and
patted
his
cheek
with
her
hand
you
are
a
dear
big
she
said
quietly
but
i
like
it
oh
so
much
from
the
tree
tops
below
the
clear
warble
of
the
purple
finch
proclaimed
that
under
the
fronds
twilight
had
fallen
the
vast
green
surface
of
the
hills
was
streaked
here
and
there
with
irregular
peaks
of
darkness
dwindling
eastward
the
sun
was
nearly
down
a
sudden
gloom
blotted
out
the
fretwork
of
the
pine
shadows
that
had
during
the
latter
part
of
the
afternoon
lain
athwart
the
rock
they
looked
up
startled
the
shadow
of
harney
had
crept
out
to
them
and
even
as
they
looked
it
stole
on
across
the
lower
ridges
toward
the
east
one
after
another
the
rounded
hills
changed
hue
as
it
crossed
them
for
a
moment
it
lingered
in
the
tangle
of
woods
at
the
outermost
edge
and
then
without
further
pause
glided
out
over
the
prairie
they
watched
it
fascinated
the
sparkle
was
quenched
in
the
cheyenne
the
white
gleam
of
the
bad
lands
became
a
dull
gray
scarce
distinguishable
from
the
gray
of
the
twilight
though
a
single
mysterious
cleft
a
long
yellow
bar
pointed
down
across
the
plains
paused
at
the
horizon
and
slowly
lifted
into
the
air
the
mountain
shadow
followed
it
steadily
up
into
the
sky
growing
and
growing
against
the
dullness
of
the
east
until
at
last
over
against
them
in
the
heavens
was
the
huge
phantom
of
a
mountain
infinitely
greater
infinitely
grander
than
any
mountain
ever
seen
by
mortal
eyes
and
lifting
higher
and
higher
commanded
upward
by
that
single
wand
of
golden
light
then
suddenly
the
wand
was
withdrawn
and
the
ghost
mountain
merged
into
the
yellow
afterglow
of
evening
the
girl
had
watched
it
breathless
at
its
dissolution
she
seized
the
young
man
excitedly
by
the
arm
the
spirit
mountain
she
cried
i
have
never
seen
it
before
and
now
i
see
it
with
you
she
looked
at
him
with
startled
eyes
with
you
she
repeated
what
is
it
i
do
understand
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
his
question
what
is
it
he
asked
again
why
nothing
she
caught
her
breath
and
recovered
command
of
herself
somewhat
that
is
it
is
just
an
old
legend
that
i
have
often
heard
and
it
startled
me
for
a
minute
will
you
tell
me
the
legend
not
now
some
time
we
must
go
now
for
it
will
soon
be
dark
they
wandered
along
the
ridge
toward
deerfoot
gulch
in
silence
she
had
taken
her
sunbonnet
off
and
was
enjoying
the
cool
of
the
evening
he
carried
the
rifle
over
the
crook
of
his
arm
and
watched
her
pensive
face
the
poor
little
chipmunk
lay
stiffening
in
the
cleft
of
the
rock
forgotten
the
next
morning
a
prying
jay
discovered
him
and
carried
him
away
he
was
only
a
little
chipmunk
after
all
a
very
little
chipmunk
and
nobody
and
nothing
missed
him
in
all
the
wide
world
not
even
his
mate
and
his
young
for
mercifully
grief
in
the
animal
world
is
generally
where
tragedies
are
frequent
his
life
meant
little
his
death
at
the
dip
of
the
gulch
they
paused
i
live
just
down
there
she
said
and
now
may
i
take
you
home
remember
your
promise
oh
very
well
she
looked
at
him
seriously
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
do
what
i
have
never
asked
any
man
before
she
said
slowly
to
meet
me
i
want
you
to
come
to
the
rock
afternoon
i
want
to
hear
more
about
new
york
of
course
i
come
he
agreed
delightedly
i
feel
as
if
i
had
known
you
years
already
they
said
she
walked
a
few
steps
irresolutely
down
the
hillside
and
then
with
a
sudden
impulsive
movement
returned
she
lifted
her
face
gravely
searchingly
to
his
i
like

she
earnestly
you

was
gone
down
through
the
graceful
alder

bennington
stood
and
watched
the
swaying
of
the
leaf
tops
that
marked
her
progress
until
she
emerged
into
the
lower
gulch
there
she
turned
and
looked
back
toward
the
ridge
but
apparently
could
not
see
him
though
he
waved
his
hand
the
next
instant
jim
fay
strolled
into
the
park
from
the
direction
of
lawton
cabin
bennington
saw
her
spring
to
meet
him
holding
out
both
hands
and
then
the
two
strolled
back
down
the
gulch
talking
earnestly
their
heads
close
together
why
should
he
care

cried
within

as
a

returned
from

with
a
watery
eye
and
a
mind
that

to
horses

full
of
scenery
when

would
hev
you
go
back
east
without
knowin
all
about

anythin
in
the
worl
i
likes
ye
thet
much
old
mizzou
paused
to
wipe
away
a
sympathetic
tear
with
a
rather
uncertain
hand
y
wants
to
start
right
off
too
thet
th
worst

and
then

sonny
so
you
mus
shore
hev
that
cayuse
old
mizzou
rambled
on
in
like
fashion
most
of
the
evening
to
bennington
great
amusement
and
though
next
morning
he
was
quite
himself
again
he
still
clung
to
the
idea
that
bennington
should
examine
the
pony
he
is
a
fine
bronc
fer
shore
he
claimed
an
you
better
git
arter
him
afore
some
one
else
gits
him
as
bennington
had
for
some
time
tentatively
revolved
in
his
mind
the
desirability
of
something
to
ride
this
struck
him
as
being
a
good
idea
all
westerners
had
horses
in
the
books
so
he
abandoned
a
romance
of
all
for
the
morning
and
drove
down
to
spanish
gulch
with
old
mizzou
he
was
mentally
braced
for
devilment
but
his
fay
was
not
in
sight
to
his
surprise
he
got
to
the
post
office
quite
without
molestation
there
he
was
handed
two
letters
one
was
from
his
parents
the
other
his
first
business
document
proved
to
be
from
the
mining
capitalist
the
latter
he
found
to
inclose
separate
drafts
for
various
amounts
in
favour
of
six
men
bishop
wrote
that
the
young
man
was
to
hand
these
drafts
to
their
owners
and
to
take
receipts
for
the
amounts
of
each
he
promised
a
further
installment
in
a
few
weeks
bennington
felt
very
important
he
looked
the
letter
all
over
again
and
examined
the
envelope
idly
the
spanish
gulch
postmark
bore
date
of
the
day
before
that
funny
said
bennington
to
himself
i
wonder
why
mizzou
bring
it
up
with
him
last
night
then
he
remembered
the
old
watery
eye
and
laughed
i
guess
i
know
he
thought
the
next
thing
was
to
find
the
men
named
in
the
letter
he
did
not
know
them
from
adam
mizzou
saw
no
difficulty
however
when
the
matter
was
laid
before
him
they
in
th
straight
flush
he
asserted
positively
this
was
astounding
how
should
old
mizzou
know
that
i
do
exactly
know
the
old
man
explained
this
discrepancy
but
they
generally
is
do
they
ever
work
work
purty
slack
crawfished
davidson
but
i
tells
you
i
we
has
to
find
out
and
he
shuffled
away
toward
the
saloon
anybody
but
bennington
would
have
suspected
something
there
was
the
delayed
letter
the
supernatural
knowledge
of
old
mizzou
the
absence
of
fay
even
the
easterner
might
have
been
puzzled
to
account
for
the
crowded
condition
of
the
straight
flush
at
ten
in
the
morning
if
his
attention
had
not
been
quite
fully
occupied
in
posing
before
himself
as
the
man
of
business
when
mizzou
and
his
companion
entered
the
room
the
hum
of
talk
died
and
every
one
turned
expectantly
in
the
direction
of
the
newcomers
gents
said
old
mizzou
this
is
de
laney
th
new
of
th
holy
smoke
de
laney
gents
there
was
a
nodding
of
heads
every
one
looked
eagerly
expectant
the
man
behind
the
bar
turned
back
his
cuffs
de
laney
feeling
himself
the
centre
of
observation
grew
nervous
he
drew
from
his
pocket
bishop
letter
and
read
out
the
five
names
i
like
to
see
those
men
he
said
the
men
designated
came
forward
after
a
moment
conversation
the
six
adjourned
to
the
hotel
where
paper
and
ink
could
be
procured
after
their
exit
a
silence
fell
and
the
miners
looked
at
each
other
with
ludicrous
faces
an
he
never
asked
us
to
take
a
drink
exclaimed
one
sorrowfully
that
settles
it
it
may
not
be
fer
th
good
of
th
camp
jim
fay
but
i
reckons
it
ai
much
fer
th
harm
of
it
i
goes
you
me
to
and
me
and
me
shouted
other
voices
fay
leaped
on
the
bar
and
spread
his
arms
abroad
speech
speech
they
cried
gentlemen
of
the
great
and
glorious
west
he
began
it
rejoices
me
to
observe
this
spirit
animating
your
bosoms
trampling
down
the
finer
feelings
that
you
all
possess
to
such
an
unlimited
degree
putting
aside
all
thought
of
merely
material
prosperity
you
are
now
prepared
at
whatever
cost
to
ally
yourselves
with
that
higher
poetic
justice
which
is
above
barter
above
mere
expediency
above
even
the
ordinary
fairness
which
often
passes
as
justice
among
the
effete
and
unenlightened
savages
of
the
east
gentlemen
of
the
great
and
glorious
west
i
congratulate
you
the
miners
stood
close
around
the
bar
every
man
face
bore
a
broad
grin
at
this
point
they
interrupted
with
howls
and
of
applause
ai
he
a
said
one
to
another
and
composed
himself
again
to
listen
at
the
conclusion
of
a
long
harangue
they
yelled
enthusiastically
and
immediately
began
the
more
informal
discussion
of
what
was
evidently
a
popular
proposition
when
the
five
who
had
been
paid
off
returned
everybody
had
a
drink
while
the
newcomers
were
made
acquainted
with
the
subject
old
mizzou
who
had
listened
silently
but
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
went
to
hunt
up
bennington
they
examined
the
horse
together
the
owner
named
thirty
dollars
as
his
price
old
mizzou
said
this
was
cheap
it
was
not
bennington
agreed
to
take
the
animal
on
trial
for
a
day
or
two
so
they
hitched
a
lariat
around
its
neck
and
led
it
over
to
the
wagon
after
despatching
a
few
errands
they
returned
to
camp
bennington
got
out
his
ledger
and
journal
and
made
entries
importantly
old
mizzou
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
corral
where
he
was
joined
presently
by
the
man
arthur
chapter
vii
the
meeting
at
the
rock
on
his
way
to
keep
the
appointment
of
the
afternoon
bennington
de
laney
discovered
within
himself
a
new
psychological
experience
he
found
that
since
the
evening
before
he
had
been
observing
things
about
him
for
the
purpose
of
detailing
them
to
his
new
friend
little
beauties
of
nature
as
when
a
strange
bird
shone
for
an
instant
in
vivid
contrast
to
the
mountain
laurel
near
his
window
an
unusual
effect
of
pine
silhouettes
near
the
sky
a
weird
suggestion
of
one
of
poe
stories
implied
in
a
contorted
shadow
cast
by
a
gnarled
little
oak
in
the
light
of
the
moon
these
he
had
noticed
and
remembered
and
was
now
eager
to
tell
his
companion
with
full
assurance
of
her
sympathy
and
understanding
three
days
earlier
he
would
have
passed
them
by
but
stranger
still
was
his
discovery
that
he
had
noticed
such
things
and
had
remembered
them
observations
of
the
sort
had
heretofore
been
quite
unconscious
without
knowing
it
he
had
always
been
a
nature
lover
one
who
appreciated
the
poetry
of
her
moods
one
who
saw
the
beauty
of
her
smiles
or
what
is
more
rare
the
greater
beauty
of
her
frown
the
influence
had
entered
into
his
being
but
had
lain
neglected
now
it
stole
forth
as
the
odour
of
a
dried
balsam
bough
steals
from
the
corner
of
a
loft
whither
it
has
been
thrown
carelessly
it
was
all
delightful
and
new
and
he
wanted
to
tell
her
of
it
he
did
so
after
a
little
he
told
her
about
a
romance
of
all
in
which
she
appeared
so
interested
that
he
detailed
the
main
idea
and
the
plot
at
her
request
he
promised
to
read
it
to
her
he
was
very
young
you
see
and
very
inexperienced
he
threw
himself
generously
without
reserve
on
this
girl
sympathies
in
a
manner
of
which
assuredly
he
should
have
been
quite
ashamed
only
the
very
young
are
not
ashamed
the
girl
listened
at
first
half
amused
then
she
was
touched
for
she
saw
that
it
was
sincere
and
youthful
and
indicative
of
clear
faith
in
what
is
beautiful
and
in
fine
ideals
of
what
is
fitting
perhaps
dimly
she
perceived
that
this
is
good
stuff
of
which
to
make
a
man
provided
it
springs
from
immaturity
and
not
from
the
sentimentalism
of
degeneracy
the
loss
of
it
is
a
price
we
pay
for
wisdom
some
think
the
price
too
high
as
he
talked
on
in
this
moonshiny
way
really
believing
his
ridiculous
abstractions
the
most
important
things
in
the
world
gradually
she
too
became
young
she
listened
with
parted
lips
and
in
her
great
eyes
the
soul
rose
and
rose
within
clearing
away
the
surface
moods
as
twilight
clears
the
land
of
everything
but
peace
he
was
telling
of
the
east
again
with
a
certain
felicity
of
expression
have
we
not
said
he
had
the
gift
of
words
and
an
abandon
of
sentiment
which
showed
how
thoroughly
he
confided
in
the
sympathy
of
his
listener
when
we
are
young
we
are
apt
to
confide
in
the
sympathy
of
every
listener
and
so
we
make
fools
of
ourselves
and
it
takes
us
a
long
time
to
live
down
our
reputations
as
we
grow
older
we
believe
less
and
less
in
its
reality
perhaps
by
and
by
we
do
not
trust
to
anybody
sympathy
not
even
our
own
we
have
an
old
country
place
he
was
saying
it
belonged
to
my
grandfather
my
grandfather
came
by
it
when
the
little
town
was
very
small
indeed
so
he
built
an
stone
house
and
surrounded
it
with
large
grounds
he
was
seeing
the
stone
house
and
the
large
grounds
with
that
new
inner
observation
which
he
had
just
discovered
and
he
was
trying
to
the
best
of
his
ability
to
tell
what
he
saw
after
a
little
he
spoke
more
rhythmically
many
might
have
thought
he
spoke
sentimentally
because
with
feeling
but
in
reality
he
was
merely
trying
with
great
earnestness
for
expression
a
jarring
word
would
have
brought
him
back
to
his
everyday
mood
but
for
the
time
being
he
was
wrapt
in
what
he
saw
this
is
a
condition
which
all
writers
and
some
lovers
will
recognise
now
the
place
is
empty
except
in
summer
except
that
we
have
an
old
woman
who
lives
tucked
away
in
one
corner
of
it
i
lived
there
one
summer
just
after
i
finished
college
outside
my
window
there
was
an
apple
tree
that
just
brushed
against
the
ledge
there
were
rose
vines
the
climbing
sort
on
the
wall
and
then
too
there
was
a
hickory
tree
that
towered
over
the
roof
in
the
front
yard
is
what
is
known
all
over
town
as
the
tree
a
silver
maple
at
least
twice
as
tall
as
the
house
it
is
so
broad
that
its
shade
falls
over
the
whole
front
of
the
place
in
the
back
is
an
orchard
of
old
apple
trees
and
trellises
of
big
blue
grapes
on
one
side
is
a
broad
lawn
at
the
back
of
which
is
one
of
the
good
flower
gardens
that
does
one
good
to
look
at
there
are
little
pink
primroses
dotting
the
sod
lavender
nasturtiums
sweet
peas
hollyhocks
bachelor
buttons
portulaca
and
a
row
of
tall
sunflowers
the
delight
of
a
sleepy
colony
of
hens
i
learned
all
the
flowers
that
summer
he
clasped
his
hands
comfortably
back
of
his
head
and
looked
at
her
she
was
gazing
out
over
the
bad
lands
to
the
east
in
the
very
centre
as
a
sort
of
protecting
nurse
to
all
the
littler
flowers
he
went
on
is
a
big
lilac
bush
and
there
the
bees
and
humming
birds
are
thick
on
a
warm
spring
day
there
are
plenty
of
birds
too
but
i
did
know
so
many
of
them
they
nested
everywhere
in
the
tree
the
orchard
the
evergreens
the
hedges
and
in
the
long
row
of
maple
trees
with
trunks
as
big
as
a
barrel
and
limbs
that
touch
across
the
street
it
must
be
beautiful
said
the
girl
quietly
without
looking
around
then
he
began
to
suppose
this
as
every
woman
knows
is
dangerous
business
it
beautiful
said
he
i
ca
tell
you
about
it
the
words
do
seem
to
fit
some
way
i
wish
you
could
see
it
for
yourself
i
know
you
enjoy
it
i
always
wanted
some
one
with
me
to
enjoy
it
too
suppose
some
way
we
were
placed
so
we
could
watch
the
year
go
by
in
those
deep
windows
first
there
is
the
spring
and
the
birds
and
the
flowers
all
of
which
i
been
talking
about
then
there
is
the
summer
when
the
shades
are
drawn
when
the
shadows
of
the
roses
wave
slowly
across
the
curtains
when
the
air
outside
quivers
with
heat
and
the
air
inside
tastes
like
a
draught
of
cool
water
all
the
bird
songs
are
stilled
except
that
one
little
fellow
still
warbles
swaying
in
the
breeze
on
the
tiptop
of
the
tree
his
notes
sliding
down
the
long
sunbeams
like
beads
on
a
golden
thread
then
we
would
read
together
in
the
something
not
very
deep
but
beautiful
like
hawthorne
stories
or
we
would
together
seek
for
these
perfect
lines
of
poetry
which
haunt
the
memory
in
the
evening
we
would
go
out
to
hear
the
crickets
and
the
tree
toads
to
see
the
night
breeze
toss
the
leaves
across
the
calm
face
of
the
moon
to
be
silenced
in
spirit
by
the
peace
of
the
stars
then
the
autumn
would
come
we
would
taste
the
and
the
little
red
grapes
and
the
big
red
grapes
we
would
take
our
choice
of
the
yellow
sweetings
the
hard
white
snow
apples
or
the
little
fellows
from
the
west
tree
and
then
of
course
there
are
the
russets
then
there
are
the
pears
and
all
the
hickory
nuts
which
rattle
down
on
us
every
time
the
wind
blows
the
leaves
are
everywhere
we
would
rake
them
up
into
big
piles
and
jump
into
them
and
about
in
them
how
bracing
the
air
is
how
silvery
the
sun
how
red
your
cheeks
would
get
and
think
of
the
bonfires
and
in
winter
murmured
the
girl
her
eyes
were
shining
in
the
winter
the
wind
would
howl
through
the
tree
and
everything
would
be
bleak
and
cold
out
doors
we
would
be
inside
of
course
and
we
would
sit
on
the
fur
rug
in
front
of
the
fireplace
while
the
evening
passed
by
watching
the
in
the
chimney
flying
slowly
away
some
more
she
begged
dreamily
i
love
it
it
rests
me
she
clasped
her
hands
back
of
her
head
and
closed
her
eyes
the
young
man
looked
quietly
about
him
this
is
a
wild
and
beautiful
country
said
he
but
it
lacks
something
i
think
it
is
the
soul
the
little
wood
lots
of
the
east
have
so
much
of
it
he
paused
in
surprise
at
his
own
thoughts
his
only
experiences
in
the
woods
east
had
been
when
out
picnicking
or
berrying
and
he
had
never
noticed
these
things
i
do
know
as
i
ever
thought
of
it
there
he
went
on
slowly
as
though
trying
to
be
honest
with
her
but
here
it
comes
to
me
somehow
or
another
a
little
shot
up
from
the
frond
below
poised
a
moment
and
dropped
back
with
closed
wings
do
you
know
the
birds
she
asked
i
afraid
not
he
admitted
i
do
really
much
about
nature
but
i
love
it
and
i
going
to
learn
more
i
know
only
the
very
common
birds
and
one
other
did
you
ever
hear
the
hermit
thrush
sing
never
oh
he
cried
in
sudden
enthusiasm
then
there
is
another
for
us
the
best
of
all
i
love
the
dear
old
house
she
objected
doubtfully
but
the
hermit
thrush
is
better
the
old
country
minister
took
me
to
hear
him
one
sunday
afternoon
and
i
shall
never
forget
it
she
glanced
at
his
animated
face
through
eyes
tell
me
she
urged
softly
we
were
back
east
he
began
and
in
the
country
just
about
this
time
of
year
we
would
wait
until
the
afternoon
why
just
about
this
time
when
the
sun
is
getting
low
we
would
push
through
the
bushes
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
where
the
little
tinkling
birds
sing
in
the
fence
corners
and
would
enter
the
deep
high
woods
where
the
trees
are
tall
and
still
the
moss
is
thick
and
soft
in
there
and
there
are
little
pools
lying
calm
and
dark
and
there
is
a
kind
of
a
in
the
air
not
silence
you
know
but
like
when
a
big
crowd
of
people
are
keeping
still
and
then
we
would
walk
very
carefully
and
speak
low
and
we
would
sit
by
the
side
of
a
fallen
log
and
wait
after
a
while
the
thrush
would
sing
a
deep
note
with
a
thrill
in
it
like
a
bell
slow
and
solemn
when
you
hear
it
you
too
feel
a
thrill
as
though
you
had
heard
a
great
and
noble
thought
why
it
is
almost
he
turned
to
the
girl
she
was
looking
at
him
why
hullo
he
exclaimed
what
the
matter
her
eyes
were
brimming
with
tears
nothing
she
said
i
never
heard
a
man
talk
as
you
have
been
talking
that
is
all
the
rest
of
them
are
cynical
and
hard
and
cold
they
would
be
ashamed
to
say
the
things
you
have
said
no
no
she
cried
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
as
he
made
a
little
uneasy
movement
do
not
misunderstand
me
i
like
it
i
love
it
it
does
me
good
i
had
lost
faith
it
is
not
nice
to
know
the
other
kind
well
you
speak
bitterly
he
expostulated
she
laughed
it
is
a
common
experience
enough
pray
that
you
may
never
know
it
i
began
as
a
little
child
loving
and
trusting
every
one
and
giving
my
full
free
heart
and
confidence
to
every
one
who
offered
his
best
to
me
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
am
thankful
for
you
that
you
have
escaped
the
suffering
such
blind
trust
leads
to
she
laughed
again
bitterly
and
threw
her
arms
out
i
suppose
i
shall
go
on
trusting
people
forever
it
in
my
nature
and
i
ca
help
it
i
hope
you
will
feel
you
can
trust
me
said
he
troubled
at
this
passion
so
much
beyond
his
experience
i
would
do
anything
for
you
do
do
she
cried
with
contempt
yes
any
number
of
people
will
anything
for
me
i
want
some
one
to
for
me
i
so
sorry
he
said
simply
but
with
great
feeling
do
pity
me
do
believe
in
me
she
cried
suddenly
in
a
passion
i
am
not
worth
it
i
am
cruel
and
hard
and
cold
and
i
never
care
for
anybody
in
any
way
my
nature
has
been
hardened
i
be
good
i
ca
care
for
people
i
think
of
giving
way
to
it
it
frightens
me
she
burst
into
sudden
tears
and
sobbed
convulsively
in
a
moment
she
became
calm
then
she
took
her
hands
from
her
eyes
and
smiled
in
the
distress
of
his
sympathy
bennington
thought
he
had
never
seen
anything
more
beautiful
than
this
breaking
forth
of
the
light
you
must
think
i
am
a
very
peculiar
young
person
she
said
but
i
told
you
i
was
a
mystery
i
am
a
little
tired
that
all
the
conversation
took
a
lighter
tone
and
ran
on
the
subject
of
the
new
horse
she
was
much
interested
inquiring
of
his
colour
his
size
his
gaits
whether
he
had
been
tried
i
tell
you
what
we
will
do
she
suggested
we
go
on
an
expedition
some
day
i
have
a
pony
too
we
will
fill
up
our
saddlebags
and
cook
our
own
dinner
i
know
a
nice
little
place
over
toward
blue
lead
i
one
suggestion
to
add
put
in
bennington
and
that
is
that
we
go
she
looked
a
trifle
doubtful
i
do
know
are
we
seeing
a
good
deal
of
each
other
oh
if
it
is
going
to
bore
you
by
all
means
put
it
off
cried
bennington
in
genuine
alarm
she
laughed
contentedly
over
his
way
of
looking
at
it
i
not
tired
then
so
please
you
and
when
i
am
i
let
you
know
it
is
shall
i
come
after
you
what
time
shall
i
start
no
i
rather
meet
you
somewhere
let
see
you
watch
for
me
and
i
ride
by
in
the
lower
gulch
about
nine
very
well
by
the
way
the
band
going
to
practise
in
town
do
you
want
to
go
i
like
to
but
i
promised
jim
i
go
with
him
jim
jim
fay
bennington
felt
this
as
a
discordant
note
do
you
know
him
very
well
he
asked
jealously
he
my
best
friend
i
like
him
very
much
he
is
a
fine
fellow
you
must
meet
him
i
met
him
said
bennington
shortly
now
you
must
go
she
commanded
after
a
pause
i
want
to
stay
here
for
a
while
no
as
he
opened
his
mouth
to
object
i
mean
it
please
be
good
after
he
had
gone
she
sat
still
until
sundown
once
she
shook
her
shoulders
impatiently
it
is
she
assured
herself
as
before
the
shadow
of
harney
crept
out
to
the
horizon
edge
there
it
stopped
twilight
fell
no
spirit
mountain
she
murmured
wistfully
at
last
almost
do
i
believe
in
the
old
legend
chapter
viii
an
adventure
in
the
night
after
supper
that
night
bennington
found
himself
unaccountably
alone
in
camp
old
mizzou
had
wandered
off
up
the
gulch
arthur
had
wandered
off
down
the
gulch
the
woman
had
locked
herself
in
her
cabin
so
having
nothing
else
to
do
he
got
out
the
manuscript
of
a
romance
of
all
and
read
it
through
carefully
from
the
beginning
to
his
surprise
he
found
it
very
poor
its
language
was
felicitous
in
some
spots
but
stilted
in
most
the
erudition
was
pedantic
and
dragged
in
by
the
ears
the
action
was
idiotic
and
the
proportions
were
padded
until
they
no
longer
existed
as
proportions
he
was
astounded
he
began
to
see
that
he
had
misconceived
the
whole
treatment
of
it
it
would
have
to
be
written
all
over
again
with
the
love
story
as
the
ruling
he
felt
very
capable
of
doing
the
love
story
he
drew
some
paper
toward
him
and
began
to
write
you
see
he
was
already
developing
every
time
a
writer
is
made
to
appreciate
that
his
work
is
poor
he
has
taken
a
step
in
advance
of
it
although
he
did
not
know
that
was
the
reason
of
it
bennington
perceived
the
deficiencies
of
because
he
had
promised
to
read
it
to
the
girl
he
saw
it
through
her
eyes
the
young
man
became
absorbed
in
redescribing
the
heroine
with
violet
eyes
a
sudden
slamming
of
the
door
behind
him
brought
him
startled
to
his
feet
he
laughed
and
was
about
to
sit
down
again
but
noticed
that
the
door
had
remained
open
he
arose
to
shut
it
over
the
trunks
of
the
nearer
pines
played
a
strange
flickering
light
throwing
them
now
into
relief
now
into
shadow
strange
murmured
bennington
to
himself
and
stepped
outside
to
investigate
as
he
crossed
the
sill
he
was
seized
on
either
side
he
cried
out
and
struggled
blindly
but
was
held
as
in
a
vice
his
captors
whom
he
dimly
perceived
to
be
large
men
in
masks
whirled
him
sharply
to
the
left
and
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
third
man
also
masked
beyond
him
were
a
score
or
so
more
some
of
whom
bore
pine
torches
which
partly
blazing
and
partly
smoking
served
to
cast
the
weird
light
he
had
seen
flickering
on
the
tree
trunks
perfect
silence
reigned
the
man
with
whom
bennington
was
fronted
eyed
him
gravely
through
the
holes
in
his
mask
i
like
to
know
what
this
means
broke
out
the
easterner
angrily
the
men
did
not
reply
they
stood
motionless
as
silent
as
the
night
in
spite
of
his
indignation
the
young
man
was
impressed
he
twisted
his
shoulders
again
the
men
at
either
arm
never
tightened
a
muscle
to
resist
and
yet
he
was
held
beyond
the
possibility
of
escape
what
the
matter
what
you
trying
to
do
take
your
hands
off
me
he
cried
again
the
silence
fell
then
at
the
end
of
what
seemed
to
the
easterner
a
full
minute
the
masked
figure
in
front
spoke
thar
is
them
that
thinks
as
how
it
ai
noways
needful
thet
ye
knows
it
said
in
slow
and
solemn
accents
but
by
the
mercy
of
others
we
gives
y
thet
much
satisfaction
you
comes
hyar
from
a
great
thet
in
times
gone
by
we
thinks
is
public
spirited
an
enterprisin
which
is
a
mistake
you
pays
th
debt
of
said
so
they
sez
an
tharfore
we
welcomes
you
to
our
bosom
cordial
what
happens
you
insults
us
by
paying
such
ornary
cusses
as
snowie

camp

just
she
arises
an

by
stringin
of

up
all
right
proper
we
gives
you
five
minutes
to
get
ready
what
do
you
mean
we
hangs
you
in
five
minutes
the
slow
even
voice
ceased
and
again
the
silence
was
broken
only
by
the
occasional
bursting
crackle
of
a
blister
in
the
pine
torches
bennington
tried
to
realize
the
situation
it
had
all
come
about
so
suddenly
i
guess
you
got
the
joke
on
me
boys
he
ventured
with
a
nervous
little
laugh
and
then
his
voice
died
away
against
the
stony
immobility
of
the
man
opposite
as
laughter
sinks
to
nothing
against
the
horror
of
a
great
darkness
bennington
began
to
feel
impressed
in
earnest
across
his
mind
crept
doubts
as
to
the
outcome
he
almost
screamed
aloud
as
some
one
stole
up
behind
and
dropped
over
his
throat
the
soft
cold
coil
of
a
lariat
then
at
a
signal
from
the
chief
the
two
men
haled
him
away
they
stopped
beneath
a
gnarled
oak
halfway
down
the
slope
to
the
gulch
bottom
from
which
protruded
like
a
long
witch
arm
a
single
withered
branch
over
this
the
unseen
threw
the
end
of
the
lariat
bennington
faced
the
expressionless
gaze
of
twenty
masks
on
which
the
torchlight
threw
strong
black
shadows
directly
in
front
of
him
the
leader
posted
himself
watch
in
hand
any
last
requests
he
inquired
in
his
measured
tones
bennington
felt
the
need
of
thinking
quickly
but
being
unused
to
emergencies
he
could
not
anywhar
y
want
yore
stuff
sent
the
other
pursued
relentlessly
bennington
swallowed
and
found
his
voice
at
last
now
be
reasonable
he
pleaded
it
is
going
to
do
you
any
good
to
hang
me
i
did
mean
to
make
any
distinctions
i
just
paid
the
oldest
debts
that
all
you
all
get
paid
there
be
some
more
money
after
a
while
and
then
i
can
pay
some
more
of
you
if
you
kill
me
you
wo
get
any
at
all
wo
get
any
any
way
some
one
muttered
audibly
from
the
crowd
the
man
with
the
watch
never
stirred
two
minutes
more
he
said
simply
one
of
the
men
who
had
been
holding
the
young
man
arms
had
fallen
back
into
the
crowd
when
the
lariat
was
thrown
over
the
oak
limb
during
the
short
colloquy
just
detailed
the
attention
of
the
other
had
become
somewhat
distracted
bennington
wrenched
himself
free
and
struck
this
man
full
in
the
face
he
had
never
in
his
life
hit
in
anger
but
behind
this
blow
was
desperation
and
the
weight
of
a
young
and
active
body
the
man
went
down
bennington
seized
the
lariat
with
both
hands
and
tried
to
wrench
it
over
his
head
the
individual
who
had
done
all
the
talking
leaped
forward
toward
him
and
dodging
a
hastily
aimed
blow
seized
him
about
the
waist
and
threw
him
neatly
to
the
ground
bennington
struggled
furiously
and
silently
the
other
had
great
difficulty
in
holding
him
down
come
here
some
of
you
fellows
he
cried
panting
and
laughing
a
little
tie
his
hands
for
the
love
of
heaven
in
another
moment
the
easterner
his
arms
securely
pinioned
stood
as
before
he
was
breathing
hard
and
the
short
struggle
had
heated
his
blood
through
and
through
bunker
hill
had
waked
up
he
set
his
teeth
resolving
that
they
should
not
get
another
word
out
of
him
the
timekeeper
raised
one
hand
warningly
over
his
shoulder
bennington
dimly
saw
a
tall
muscular
figure
tense
with
the
expectation
of
effort
lean
forward
to
the
slack
of
the
lariat
he
stared
back
to
the
front
the
leader
raised
his
pistol
to
give
the
signal
bennington
shut
his
eyes
then
ensued
a
pause
and
a
murmuring
of
low
voices
bennington
looked
and
to
his
surprise
perceived
lawton
girl
in
earnest
expostulation
with
the
leader
of
the
band
as
he
listened
their
voices
rose
so
he
caught
snatches
of
their
talk
confound
it
all
objected
the
man
in
exasperated
tones
you
play
fair
that
was
the
agreement
at
all
agreement
or
no
agreement
this
thing
gone
far
enough
she
rejoined
sharply
i
watched
the
whole
performance
and
i
been
expecting
for
the
last
ten
minutes
you
have
sense
enough
to
quit
the
voices
died
to
a
murmuring
once
the
girl
stamped
her
foot
and
once
the
man
spread
his
hands
out
in
deprecation
the
maskers
grouped
about
in
silent
enjoyment
of
the
scene
at
last
the
discussion
terminated
it
all
up
boys
cried
the
man
savagely
tearing
off
his
mask
to
bennington
vast
surprise
the
features
of
jim
fay
were
discovered
he
approached
and
began
sullenly
to
undo
the
young
man
pinioned
arms
the
others
rolled
up
their
masks
and
put
them
in
their
pockets
they
laughed
to
each
other
consumedly
the
tall
man
approached
rubbing
his
jaw
you
hits
hard
sonny
said
he
and
you
do
go
down
in
yore
boots
a
a
little
bit
the
group
began
to
break
up
and
move
down
the
gulch
most
of
the
men
shouting
out
a
word
or
so
of
farewell
bennington
recovering
from
his
daze
at
the
rapid
passage
of
these
events
stepped
forward
to
where
fay
and
the
girl
had
resumed
their
discussion
he
saw
that
the
young
miner
had
recovered
his
habitual
tone
of
raillery
and
that
the
girl
was
now
looking
up
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
deprecation
miss
lawton
said
bennington
with
formality
i
hope
you
will
allow
me
after
your
great
kindness
to
see
that
you
get
down
the
gulch
safely
fay
cut
in
before
the
girl
could
reply
do
bother
about
that
de
laney
said
he
in
a
most
cavalier
fashion
i
see
to
it
i
did
not
address
you
sir
returned
bennington
coldly
the
westerner
eyes
twinkled
with
amusement
the
girl
interrupted
thank
you
very
much
de
laney
but
fay
is
right
i
trouble
you
her
eyes
commanded
fay
and
he
moved
a
little
apart
do
be
angry
she
pleaded
hurriedly
in
an
undertone
but
better
that
way
and
i
think
you
acted
grandly
you
are
the
one
who
acted
grandly
he
replied
a
little
mollified
how
can
i
ever
thank
you
you
came
just
in
time
she
laughed
you
not
angry
are
you
she
coaxed
no
of
course
not
what
right
have
i
to
be
i
do
like
that
quite
but
i
suppose
it
will
do
you
be
there
you
know
i
will
then
she
gave
his
folded
arm
a
hasty
pat
and
ran
on
down
the
hill
after
fay
who
had
gone
on
bennington
saw
her
seize
his
shoulders
as
she
overtook
him
and
give
them
a
severe
shake
the
light
of
the
torches
down
the
gulch
wavered
and
disappeared
bennington
returned
to
his
room
on
the
table
lay
his
manuscript
and
the
ink
was
hardly
dried
on
the
last
word
of
it
outside
a
began
to
utter
its
weird
call
the
candle
before
him
sputtered
and
burned
again
with
a
clear
flame
footnote
a
western
to
become
frightened
chapter
ix
the
heavens
opened
bennington
awoke
early
the
next
morning
a
pleased
glow
of
anticipation
warming
his
heart
and
almost
before
his
eyes
were
opened
he
had
raised
himself
to
leap
out
of
the
bunk
then
with
a
disappointed
sigh
he
sank
back
on
the
roof
fell
the
heavy
patter
of
raindrops
after
a
time
he
arose
and
pulled
aside
the
curtains
of
a
window
the
nearer
world
was
dripping
the
farther
world
was
hidden
or
obscured
by
long
veils
of
rain
driven
in
ragged
clouds
before
a
west
wind
yesterday
the
leaves
had
waved
lightly
the
undergrowth
of
shrubs
had
uplifted
in
feathery
airiness
of
texture
the
ground
beneath
had
been
crisp
and
aromatic
with
pine
needles
now
everything
bore
a
drooping
sodden
aspect
which
spoke
rather
of
decay
than
of
the
life
of
spring
even
the
chickens
had
wisely
remained
indoors
with
the
exception
of
a
single
bedraggled
old
rooster
whose
melancholy
appearance
added
another
shade
of
gloom
to
the
dismal
outlook
the
wind
twisted
his
long
tail
feathers
from
side
to
side
so
energetically
that
even
as
bennington
looked
the
poor
fowl
perforce
had
to
scud
careened
from
one
side
to
the
other
like
a
craft
into
the
shelter
of
his
coop
the
wind
left
to
its
own
devices
skittered
across
little
pools
of
water
and
tried
in
vain
to
induce
the
soaked
leaves
of
the
autumn
before
to
essay
an
aerial
flight
the
rain
hit
the
roof
now
in
heavy
gusts
as
though
some
one
had
dashed
it
from
a
pail
the
wind
whistled
through
a
loosened
shingle
and
rattled
around
an
joint
within
the
house
itself
some
slight
sounds
of
preparation
for
breakfast
sounded
the
clearer
against
the
turmoil
outside
and
then
bennington
became
conscious
that
for
some
time
he
had
another
sound
underneath
all
the
rest
it
was
grand
and
organlike
in
tone
resembling
the
roar
of
surf
on
a
sand
beach
as
much
as
anything
else
he
looked
out
again
and
saw
that
it
was
the
wind
in
the
trees
the
same
conditions
that
had
before
touched
the
harp
murmur
of
a
stiller
day
now
struck
out
a
rush
and
roar
almost
in
its
volume
bennington
impulsively
threw
open
the
window
and
leaned
out
the
great
hill
back
of
the
camp
was
so
steep
that
the
pines
growing
on
its
slope
offered
to
the
breeze
an
almost
perpendicular
screen
of
branches
instead
of
one
or
at
most
a
dozen
trees
the
wind
here
passed
through
a
thousand
at
once
as
a
consequence
the
stir
of
air
that
in
a
level
woodland
would
arouse
but
a
faint
whisper
here
would
pass
with
a
rustling
murmur
a
murmur
would
be
magnified
into
a
noise
as
of
the
mellow
falling
of
waters
and
now
that
the
storm
had
awakened
the
hill
caught
up
its
cry
with
a
howl
so
awful
and
sustained
that
as
the
open
window
let
in
the
full
volume
of
its
blast
bennington
involuntarily
drew
back
he
closed
the
sash
and
turned
to
dress
after
the
first
disappointment
strange
to
say
bennington
became
quite
resigned
he
had
felt
a
little
illogically
that
this
giving
of
a
whole
day
to
the
picnic
was
not
quite
the
thing
his
puritan
conscience
impressed
him
with
the
sacredness
of
work
he
settled
down
to
the
fact
of
the
rainstorm
with
a
pleasant
recognition
of
its
inevitability
and
a
resolve
to
improve
his
time
to
that
end
after
breakfast
he
drew
on
a
pair
of
slippers
donned
a
sweater
occupied
two
chairs
in
the
fashion
and
attacked
with
energy
the
pages
of
le
conte
this
book
as
you
very
well
know
discourses
at
first
with
great
interest
concerning
erosions
among
other
things
it
convinces
you
that
a
current
of
water
being
doubled
in
swiftness
can
transport
a
mass
times
as
heavy
as
when
it
ran
half
as
fast
this
astounding
proposition
is
abstrusely
proved
as
bennington
had
resolved
not
to
make
his
reading
mere
recreation
he
drew
diagrams
conscientiously
until
he
understood
it
then
he
passed
on
to
an
earnest
consideration
of
why
the
revolution
of
the
globe
and
the
resistance
of
continents
cause
oceanic
currents
of
a
particular
direction
and
velocity
besides
this
there
was
much
easier
reading
concerning
alluvial
deposits
so
interested
did
he
grow
that
old
mizzou
coming
in
and
glistening
from
a
round
of
the
stock
found
him
quite
unapproachable
on
the
subject
of
cribbage
the
patriarch
then
stumped
over
to
cabin
after
dinner
bennington
picked
up
the
book
again
but
found
that
his
brain
had
reached
the
limit
of
spontaneous
mental
effort
he
looked
for
old
mizzou
and
the
cribbage
game
the
miner
had
gone
to
visit
arthur
again
bennington
wandered
about
disconsolately
for
a
time
he
drummed
idly
on
the
window
pane
then
he
took
out
his
revolver
and
tried
to
practise
through
the
open
doorway
the
smoke
from
the
discharges
hung
heavy
in
the
damp
air
filling
the
room
in
a
most
disagreeable
fashion
bennington
trips
to
see
the
effect
of
his
shots
proved
to
him
the
fiendish
propensity
of
everything
he
touched
were
it
never
so
lightly
to
sprinkle
him
with
cold
water
above
all
his
skill
with
the
weapon
was
not
great
enough
as
yet
to
make
it
much
fun
he
abandoned
pistol
shooting
and
yawned
extensively
wishing
it
were
time
to
go
to
bed
in
the
evening
he
played
cribbage
with
old
mizzou
after
a
time
arthur
and
his
wife
came
in
and
they
had
a
dreary
game
of
cinch
the
man
speaking
but
little
the
woman
not
at
all
old
mizzou
smoked
incessantly
on
a
corncob
pipe
charged
with
a
peculiarly
pungent
variety
of
tobacco
which
filled
the
air
with
a
blue
vapour
and
penetrated
unpleasantly
into
bennington
mucous
membranes
the
next
morning
it
was
still
raining
bennington
became
very
impatient
indeed
but
he
tackled
le
conte
industriously
and
did
well
enough
until
he
tried
to
get
it
into
his
head
why
various
things
happen
to
glaciers
then
viscosity
the
lines
of
swiftest
motion
relegation
and
directions
of
pressure
came
forth
from
the
printed
pages
and
mocked
him
he
arose
in
his
might
and
went
forth
into
the
open
air
before
going
out
he
had
put
on
his
canvas
shooting
coat
and
a
pair
of
hobnailed
leather
hunting
boots
laced
for
a
little
distance
at
the
front
and
sides
he
visited
the
horses
standing
disconsolate
under
an
open
shed
in
the
corral
he
slopped
with
constantly
accruing
masses
of
sticky
earth
at
his
feet
to
the
chicken
coop
into
which
he
cast
an
eye
he
even
took
the
kitchen
pails
and
tramped
down
to
the
spring
and
back
in
the
gulch
he
did
not
see
or
hear
a
living
thing
a
and
dirty
little
stream
was
trickling
destructively
through
all
manner
of
shivering
grasses
and
flowers
the
water
from
bennington
sleeves
ran
down
over
the
harsh
canvas
cuffs
and
turned
his
hands
purple
with
the
cold
he
returned
to
the
cabin
and
changed
his
clothes
the
short
walk
had
refreshed
him
but
it
had
spurred
his
impatience
outside
the
world
seemed
to
have
changed
his
experience
with
the
hills
up
to
now
had
always
been
in
one
phase
of
their
beauty
that
of
clear
bright
sunshine
and
soft
skies
now
it
was
as
a
different
country
he
could
not
get
rid
of
the
feeling
foolish
as
it
was
that
it
was
in
reality
different
and
that
the
whole
episode
of
the
girl
and
the
rock
was
as
a
vision
which
had
passed
it
grew
indistinct
in
the
presence
of
this
iron
reality
of
cold
and
wet
he
could
not
assure
himself
he
had
not
imagined
it
all
thus
belated
he
came
to
thinking
of
her
again
and
having
now
nothing
else
to
do
he
fell
into
daydreams
that
had
no
other
effect
than
to
reveal
to
him
the
impatience
which
had
been
from
the
first
the
real
cause
of
his
restlessness
under
the
temporary
confinement
now
the
impatience
grew
in
intensity
he
resolved
that
if
the
morrow
did
not
end
the
storm
he
would
tramp
down
the
gulch
to
make
a
call
all
this
time
lay
quite
untouched
the
next
day
dawned
darker
than
ever
after
breakfast
old
mizzou
as
usual
went
out
to
feed
the
horses
and
bennington
through
sheer
idleness
accompanied
him
they
distributed
the
oats
and
hay
and
then
stood
sheltered
from
the
direct
rain
conversing
idly
suddenly
the
wind
died
and
the
rain
ceased
in
the
place
of
the
gloom
succeeded
a
strange
glare
which
lay
on
the
spirit
with
almost
physical
oppression
old
mizzou
shouted
something
and
scrambled
excitedly
to
the
house
bennington
looked
about
him
bewildered
over
back
of
the
hill
dimly
discernible
through
the
trees
loomed
the
black
irregular
shape
of
a
cloud
in
dismal
contrast
to
the
yellow
glare
which
now
filled
all
the
sky
the
horses
frightened
crowded
up
close
to
bennington
trying
to
push
their
noses
over
his
shoulder
a
number
of
jays
and
finches
rushed
down
through
the
woods
and
darted
rapidly
each
with
its
peculiar
flight
toward
a
clump
of
trees
and
bushes
standing
on
a
ridge
across
the
valley
from
the
cabin
old
mizzou
was
shouting
to
him
he
turned
to
follow
the
old
man
back
of
him
something
vast
and
awful
roared
out
and
then
all
at
once
he
felt
himself
struggling
with
a
rush
of
waters
he
was
jammed
violently
against
the
posts
of
the
corral
there
he
worked
to
his
feet
the
whole
side
of
the
hill
was
one
vast
spread
of
shallow
tossing
water
as
though
a
lake
had
been
let
fall
on
the
summit
of
the
ridge
the
smaller
bushes
were
uprooted
and
swept
along
but
the
trees
and
saplings
held
their
own
in
a
moment
the
stones
and
ridgelets
began
to
show
it
was
over
not
a
drop
of
rain
had
fallen
bennington
climbed
the
corral
fence
and
walked
slowly
to
the
house
the
blacksmith
shop
was
filled
to
the
window
and
arthur
cabin
was
not
much
better
he
entered
the
kitchen
the
floor
there
was
some
two
inches
submerged
but
the
water
was
slowly
escaping
through
the
door
by
which
bennington
had
come
in
across
the
door
arthur
had
laid
a
folded
rug
in
front
of
the
barrier
stood
the
lady
herself
vigorously
sweeping
back
the
threatening
water
from
her
only
glorious
apartment
bennington
took
the
broom
from
her
and
swept
until
the
cessation
of
the
flood
made
it
no
longer
necessary
arthur
commenced
to
mop
the
floor
the
young
man
stepped
outside
there
he
was
joined
a
moment
later
by
the
other
two
they
offered
no
explanation
of
their
whereabouts
during
the
trouble
but
bennington
surmised
shrewdly
that
they
had
hunted
a
dry
place
glory
cried
old
mizzou
lucky
she
misses
us
what
was
it
where
it
come
from
inquired
bennington
shaking
the
surface
drops
from
his
shoulders
he
was
wet
through
replied
the
miner
she
hit
up
th
ridge
a
ways
if
she
ever
burst
yere
sonny
ye
never
know
what
drownded
ye
look
at
that
gulch
the
water
had
now
drained
from
the
hill
entirely
it
could
be
seen
that
most
of
the
surface
earth
had
been
washed
away
leaving
the
skeleton
of
the
mountain
bare
some
of
the
more
slightly
rooted
trees
had
fallen
or
clung
precariously
to
the
earth
with
bony
fingers
but
the
gulch
itself
was
terrible
the
mountain
laurel
the
elders
the
sarvis
bushes
the
wild
roses
which
a
few
days
before
had
been
fragrant
and
beautiful
with
blossom
and
leaf
and
musical
with
birds
had
disappeared
in
their
stead
rolled
an
angry
brown
flood
whirling
in
almost
unbroken
surface
from
bank
to
bank
several
oaks
submerged
to
their
branches
raised
their
arms
helplessly
as
bennington
looked
one
of
these
bent
slowly
and
sank
from
sight
a
moment
later
it
shot
with
great
suddenness
half
its
length
into
the
air
was
seized
by
the
eager
waters
and
whisked
away
as
lightly
as
though
it
had
been
a
tree
of
straw
dark
objects
began
to
come
down
with
the
stream
they
seemed
to
be
trying
to
preserve
a
semblance
of
dignity
in
their
stately
bobbing
up
and
down
but
apparently
found
the
attempt
difficult
the
roar
was
almost
deafening
but
even
above
it
a
strangely
deliberate
grinding
noise
was
audible
old
mizzou
said
it
was
the
grating
of
boulders
as
they
were
rolled
along
the
bed
of
the
stream
the
yellow
glow
had
disappeared
from
the
air
and
the
gloom
of
rain
had
taken
its
place
a
fine
mist
began
to
fall
bennington
for
the
first
time
realized
he
was
wet
and
shivering
and
so
he
turned
inside
to
change
his
clothes
it
all
be
over
in
a
few
hours
remarked
arthur
i
reckon
them
spanish
gulch
people
wish
they
lived
bennington
paused
at
the
doorway
that
so
he
commented
how
about
spanish
gulch
will
it
all
be
drowned
out
no
i
reckon
not
replied
arthur
they
get
wet
down
a
lot
and
have
wet
blankets
to
sleep
in
that
all
you
see
the
gulch
spraddles
out
down
there
an
then
too
all
this
timber
jam
down
this
gulch
that
back
up
th
water
some
and
so
she
wo
come
all
of
a
rush
i
see
said
bennington
the
afternoon
was
well
enough
occupied
in
repairing
to
some
extent
the
ravages
of
the
brief
storm
a
length
of
the
corral
had
succumbed
to
the
flood
many
valuable
tools
in
the
blacksmith
shop
were
in
danger
of
rust
from
the
dampness
and
arthur
and
his
wife
had
been
completely
washed
out
all
three
men
worked
hard
setting
things
to
rights
the
twilight
caught
them
before
their
work
was
done
bennington
found
himself
too
weary
to
attempt
an
unknown
road
by
dark
he
played
cribbage
with
old
mizzou
and
won
about
half
past
nine
he
pushed
back
his
chair
and
went
outside
the
stars
had
come
out
by
the
thousand
and
a
solitary
cricket
which
had
in
some
way
escaped
the
deluge
was
chirping
in
the
middle
distance
with
a
sudden
uplift
of
the
heart
he
realized
that
he
would
see
her
on
the
morrow
he
learned
that
no
matter
how
philosophically
we
may
have
borne
a
separation
the
prospect
of
its
near
end
shows
us
how
strong
the
repression
has
been
the
lifting
of
the
bonds
makes
evident
how
much
they
have
galled
chapter
x
the
world
made
young
the
morning
fulfilled
the
promise
of
the
night
before
bennington
de
laney
awoke
to
a
world
fresh
with
the
early
breezes
a
multitude
of
birds
outside
the
window
bubbled
and
warbled
and
carolled
away
with
all
their
little
mights
either
in
joy
at
the
return
of
peace
or
in
sorrow
at
the
loss
of
their
houses
sorrow
and
joy
sound
much
alike
as
nature
tells
them
the
farther
ridges
and
the
prairies
were
once
more
in
view
but
now
oh
wonder
the
great
plain
had
cast
aside
its
robes
of
monk
brown
and
had
stepped
forth
in
jolly
the
air
was
full
of
tingling
life
altogether
a
morning
to
cry
one
to
leap
eagerly
from
bed
to
rush
to
the
window
to
drink
in
deep
draughts
of
electric
balmy
ozone
and
to
thank
heaven
for
the
grace
of
mere
existence
that
at
least
is
what
bennington
did
and
he
did
more
he
despatched
a
hasty
breakfast
and
went
forth
and
saddled
his
steed
and
rode
away
down
the
gulch
with
never
a
thought
of
sample
tests
and
never
a
care
whether
the
day
work
were
done
or
not
for
this
was
springtime
and
the
air
was
snapping
with
it
near
the
chickens
shelter
the
burnished
old
gobbler
spread
his
tail
and
dragged
his
wings
and
puffed
his
feathers
and
swelled
himself
red
in
the
face
to
the
great
admiration
of
a
demure
little
turkey
hen
overhead
wheeled
two
small
hawks
screaming
they
clashed
and
light
feathers
came
floating
down
from
the
encounter
yet
presently
they
flew
away
together
to
a
hole
in
a
dead
tree
three
song
sparrows
dashed
almost
to
his
very
feet
so
busily
fighting
that
they
hardly
escaped
the
pony
hoofs
everywhere
love
songs
trilled
from
the
underbrush
and
bennington
de
laney
as
young
as
full
of
life
as
unmated
as
they
rode
slowly
along
thinking
of
his
lady
love
and
hullo
where
are
you
going
cried
she
he
looked
up
with
eager
joy
to
find
that
they
had
met
in
the
middle
of
what
used
to
be
the
road
the
gulch
had
been
swept
bare
by
the
flood
not
only
of
every
representative
of
the
vegetable
world
but
also
of
the
very
earth
in
which
it
had
grown
from
the
remains
of
the
roadbed
projected
sharp
flints
and
rocks
among
which
the
broncos
picked
their
way
mary
he
cried
i
was
just
coming
to
see
you
it
a
great
rain
and
is
the
gulch
awful
down
near
our
way
the
timber
began
to
jam
and
it
is
all
choked
up
but
up
here
it
is
desolate
he
turned
his
horse
about
and
they
paced
slowly
along
together
telling
each
other
their
respective
experiences
in
the
storm
it
seemed
that
the
lawtons
had
known
nothing
of
the
itself
except
from
its
effects
in
filling
up
the
ravine
rumours
of
the
drowning
of
a
miner
were
about
it
soon
became
evident
that
the
brightness
of
the
morning
was
reflected
from
the
girl
mood
she
fairly
sparkled
with
gaiety
and
high
spirits
the
two
got
along
famously
where
are
you
going
asked
bennington
at
last
on
the
picnic
of
course
she
rejoined
promptly
were
you
invited
i
thought
you
were
i
thought
it
would
be
too
wet
he
averred
in
explanation
not
a
bit
the
rain
dries
quickly
in
the
hills
and
the
only
came
into
this
gulch
i
have
here
she
went
on
twisting
around
in
her
saddle
to
inspect
a
large
bundle
and
a
pair
of
saddle
bags
i
have
here
a
coffee
pot
a
frying
pan
a
little
kettle
two
tin
cups
and
various
sorts
of
grub
i
am
fixed
for
a
scout
sure
now
when
we
get
near
your
camp
you
must
run
up
and
get
an
axe
and
some
matches
bennington
observed
with
approval
the
corpulency
of
the
bundle
and
the
skilful
manner
with
which
it
was
tied
on
he
noted
with
perhaps
more
approval
her
lithe
figure
in
its
painter
blouse
and
rough
skirt
and
the
rosiness
of
her
cheeks
under
a
cloth
cap
caught
on
awry
as
the
ponies
sought
a
path
at
a
snail
pace
through
the
sharp
flints
she
showed
in
a
thousand
ways
how
high
the
gaiety
of
her
animal
spirits
had
mounted
she
sang
airy
little
pieces
of
songs
she
uttered
single
clear
notes
she
mocked
with
a
ludicrously
feminine
croak
the
hoarse
voice
of
a
crow
sailing
over
them
she
rallied
bennington
mercilessly
on
his
corduroys
his
yellow
flapped
pistol
holster
his
laced
boots
she
went
over
in
ridiculous
pantomime
the
scene
of
the
mock
lynching
until
bennington
rolled
in
his
saddle
with
laughter
and
wondered
how
it
was
possible
he
had
ever
taken
the
affair
seriously
when
he
returned
with
the
axe
she
was
hugely
alarmed
lest
he
harm
himself
by
his
awkward
way
of
carrying
it
and
gave
him
much
wholesome
advice
in
her
most
maternal
manner
after
all
of
which
she
would
catch
his
eye
and
they
would
both
laugh
to
startle
the
birds
blue
lead
proved
to
be
some
distance
away
for
which
fact
bennington
was
not
sorry
at
length
they
surmounted
a
little
ridge
over
its
summit
there
started
into
being
a
long
cool
draw
broad
and
shallow
near
the
top
but
deepening
by
insensible
degrees
into
a
cañon
filled
already
with
shrubs
and
thickly
grown
with
saplings
of
beech
and
ash
through
the
screen
of
slender
trunks
could
be
seen
miniature
open
parks
carpeted
with
a
soft
tiny
fern
not
high
enough
to
conceal
the
ears
of
a
rabbit
or
to
quench
the
flame
of
the
tiger
lily
that
grew
there
soon
a
little
brook
sprang
from
nowhere
and
crept
timidly
through
and
under
thick
mosses
after
a
time
it
increased
in
size
and
when
it
had
become
large
enough
to
bubble
over
clear
gravel
mary
called
a
halt
we
have
our
picnic
here
she
decided
the
ravine
at
this
point
received
another
little
gulch
into
itself
and
where
the
two
came
together
the
bottom
widened
out
into
almost
parklike
proportions
on
one
side
was
a
encroached
upon
by
numerous
raspberry
vines
on
the
other
was
the
brook
flowing
noisily
in
the
shade
of
saplings
and
of
ferns
bennington
unsaddled
the
horses
and
led
them
over
to
the
where
he
picketed
them
securely
in
such
a
manner
that
they
could
not
become
entangled
when
he
returned
to
the
brookside
he
found
that
mary
had
undone
her
bundle
and
spread
out
its
contents
there
were
various
utensils
some
corn
meal
coffee
two
slices
of
ham
raw
potatoes
a
small
bottle
of
milk
some
eggs
wonderfully
preserved
by
moss
inside
the
pail
and
some
bread
and
cake
bennington
eyed
all
this
in
dismay
she
caught
his
look
and
laughed
ca
you
cook
well
i
can
you
just
obey
orders
we
wo
get
anything
to
eat
before
night
objected
bennington
dolefully
as
he
looked
over
the
decidedly
raw
material
and
he
hungry
she
teased
never
mind
you
build
a
fire
bennington
brightened
he
had
one
outdoor
knack
that
of
lighting
matches
in
a
wind
and
inducing
refractory
wood
to
burn
his
skill
had
often
been
called
into
requisition
in
the
igniting
of
beach
fires
and
the
camp
fires
of
girls
he
collected
dry
twigs
from
the
sunny
places
cut
slivers
with
his
knife
built
over
the
whole
a
pyramid
of
heavier
twigs
against
which
he
leaned
his
firewood
then
he
touched
off
the
combination
the
slivers
ignited
the
twigs
the
twigs
set
fire
to
the
wigwam
the
wigwam
started
the
firewood
bennington
honour
was
vindicated
he
felt
proud
mary
who
had
been
filling
the
coffee
pot
at
the
creek
approached
and
viewed
the
triumph
she
cast
upon
it
the
glance
of
scorn
that
no
cooking
fire
said
she
so
bennington
under
her
directions
placed
together
the
two
parallel
logs
with
the
hewn
sides
and
built
the
small
bright
fire
between
them
now
you
see
she
explained
i
can
put
my
frying
pan
and
coffee
pot
and
kettle
across
the
two
logs
i
can
get
at
them
easy
and
do
burn
my
fingers
now
you
may
peel
the
potatoes
the
easterner
peeled
potatoes
under
constant
laughing
amendment
as
to
method
then
the
small
cook
collected
her
materials
about
her
in
grand
preparation
for
the
final
rites
she
turned
back
the
loose
sleeves
of
her
blouse
to
the
elbow
this
drew
an
exclamation
from
bennington
why
mary
how
white
your
arms
are
he
cried
astonished
she
surveyed
her
forearm
with
a
little
blush
turning
it
back
and
forth
i
pretty
tanned
she
agreed
the
coffee
pot
was
filled
and
placed
across
the
logs
at
one
end
and
left
to
its
own
devices
a
little
removed
from
the
hottest
of
the
fire
the
kettle
stood
next
half
filled
with
salted
water
in
which
nestled
the
potatoes
like
so
many
nested
eggs
mary
mixed
a
mysterious
concoction
of
corn
meal
eggs
butter
and
some
white
powder
mushing
the
whole
up
with
milk
and
water
the
mixture
she
spread
evenly
in
the
bottom
of
the
frying
pan
which
she
set
in
a
warm
place
it
is
much
of
a
baking
tin
she
commented
eyeing
it
critically
but
it
do
under
her
direction
bennington
impaled
the
two
slices
of
ham
on
long
green
switches
and
stuck
these
upright
in
the
ground
in
such
a
position
that
the
warmth
from
the
flames
could
just
reach
them
they
never
cook
there
he
objected
did
expect
they
would
she
retorted
briefly
then
relenting
they
finish
better
if
they
warmed
through
first
she
explained
by
this
time
the
potatoes
were
bubbling
energetically
and
the
coffee
was
sending
out
a
fragrant
steam
mary
stabbed
experimentally
at
the
vegetables
with
a
sharpened
sliver
apparently
satisfied
she
drew
back
with
a
happy
sigh
she
shook
her
hair
from
her
eyes
and
smiled
across
at
bennington
ready
go
cried
she
the
frying
pan
was
covered
with
a
tin
plate
on
which
were
heaped
live
coals
more
coals
were
poked
from
between
the
logs
on
to
a
flat
place
were
spread
out
thin
and
were
crowned
by
the
frying
pan
and
its
glowing
freight
bennington
held
over
the
fire
a
switch
of
ham
in
each
hand
taking
care
according
to
directions
not
to
approach
the
actual
blaze
mary
borrowed
his
hunting
knife
and
disappeared
into
the
thicket
in
a
moment
she
returned
with
a
improvised
very
simply
from
a
forked
branch
of
a
sapling
one
of
the
forks
was
left
long
for
the
hand
the
other
was
cut
short
the
result
was
like
an
esquimaux
fishhook
she
then
relieved
bennington
of
his
task
while
that
young
man
lifted
the
kettle
from
the
fire
and
carefully
drained
away
the
water
dinner
she
called
gaily
bennington
looked
up
surprised
he
had
been
so
absorbed
in
the
spells
wrought
by
this
dainty
woods
fairy
that
he
had
forgotten
the
flight
of
time
it
was
enough
for
him
to
watch
the
turn
of
her
wrist
the
swift
certainty
of
her
movements
to
catch
the
glow
lit
in
her
face
by
the
fire
over
which
she
bent
then
he
suddenly
remembered
that
her
movements
had
all
along
tended
toward
dinner
and
were
not
got
up
simply
and
merely
that
he
might
discover
new
charms
in
the
small
housekeeper
he
found
himself
seated
on
a
rock
with
a
tin
plate
in
his
lap
a
tin
cup
at
his
side
and
an
eager
little
lady
in
front
of
him
anxious
that
he
should
taste
all
her
dishes
and
deliver
an
opinion
forthwith
the
coffee
he
pronounced
nectar
the
ham
and
mealy
potatoes
delicious
the
of
a
yellow
golden
crispness
which
the
originator
of
might
envy
and
the
bread
and
cake
and
butter
and
sugar
only
the
less
meritorious
that
they
had
not
been
prepared
by
her
own
hands
and
on
the
spot
and
see
she
cried
clapping
her
hands
the
sun
is
still
directly
over
us
it
is
not
night
yet
silly
boy
chapter
xi
and
he
did
eat
after
the
meal
he
wanted
to
lie
down
in
the
grasses
and
watch
the
clouds
sail
by
but
she
would
have
none
of
it
she
haled
him
away
to
the
brookside
there
she
showed
him
how
to
wash
dishes
by
filling
them
half
full
of
water
in
which
fine
gravel
has
been
mixed
and
then
whirling
the
whole
rapidly
until
the
tin
is
rubbed
quite
clean
never
was
prosaic
task
more
delightful
they
knelt
side
by
side
on
the
bank
under
the
dense
leaves
and
dabbled
in
the
water
happily
the
ferns
were
fresh
and
cool
once
a
redbird
shot
confidently
down
from
above
on
wing
caught
sight
of
these
intruders
brought
up
with
a
swish
of
feathers
and
eyed
them
gravely
for
some
time
from
a
neighbouring
treelet
apparently
he
was
satisfied
with
his
inspection
for
after
a
few
minutes
he
paid
no
further
attention
to
them
but
went
about
his
business
quietly
when
the
dishes
had
been
washed
mary
stood
over
bennington
while
he
packed
them
in
the
bundle
and
strapped
them
on
the
saddle
now
said
she
at
last
we
have
nothing
more
to
think
of
until
we
go
home
she
was
like
a
child
playing
with
exhaustless
spirits
at
the
most
trivial
games
not
for
a
moment
would
she
listen
to
anything
of
a
serious
nature
bennington
with
the
heavier
pertinacity
of
men
when
they
have
struck
a
congenial
vein
tried
to
repeat
to
some
extent
the
experience
of
the
last
afternoon
at
the
rock
mary
laughed
his
sentiment
to
ridicule
and
his
poetics
to
scorn
everything
he
said
she
twisted
into
something
funny
or
ridiculous
he
wanted
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
the
calm
peace
of
the
little
ravine
in
which
they
had
pitched
their
temporary
camp
but
she
made
a
quiet
life
miserable
to
him
at
last
in
sheer
desperation
he
arose
to
pursue
whereupon
she
vanished
lightly
into
the
underbrush
a
moment
later
he
heard
her
clear
laugh
mocking
him
from
some
elder
thickets
a
hundred
yards
away
bennington
pursued
with
ardour
it
was
as
though
a
ocean
liner
were
to
try
to
run
down
a
lively
little
yacht
bennington
had
always
considered
girls
as
weak
creatures
incapable
of
swift
motion
and
needing
assistance
whenever
the
country
departed
from
the
artificial
level
of
macadam
he
had
also
thought
himself
fairly
active
he
revised
these
ideas
this
girl
could
travel
through
the
thin
brush
of
the
creek
bottom
two
feet
to
his
one
because
she
ran
more
lightly
and
surely
and
her
endurance
was
not
a
matter
for
discussion
the
question
of
second
wind
did
not
concern
her
any
more
than
it
does
a
child
whose
ordinary
mode
of
progression
is
heartbreaking
bennington
found
that
he
was
engaged
in
the
most
delightful
play
of
his
life
he
shouted
aloud
with
the
fun
of
it
he
had
the
feeling
that
he
was
grasping
at
a
sunbeam
or
a
that
always
eluded
him
he
would
lose
her
utterly
and
would
stand
quite
motionless
listening
for
a
long
time
suddenly
without
warning
an
exaggerated
leaf
crown
would
fall
about
his
neck
and
he
would
be
overwhelmed
with
ridicule
at
the
outrageous
figure
he
presented
then
for
a
time
she
seemed
everywhere
at
once
the
mottled
sunlight
under
the
trees
danced
and
quivered
after
her
smiling
and
darkening
as
she
dimpled
or
was
grave
the
little
whirlwinds
of
the
gulches
seized
the
leaves
and
danced
with
her
too
the
birches
and
aspens
tossed
their
hands
and
rising
ever
higher
and
wilder
and
more
came
the
mocking
cadences
of
her
laughter
after
a
time
she
disappeared
again
bennington
stood
still
waiting
for
some
new
prank
but
he
waited
in
vain
he
instituted
a
search
but
the
search
was
fruitless
he
called
but
received
no
reply
at
last
he
made
his
way
again
to
the
dell
in
which
they
had
lunched
and
there
he
found
her
flat
on
her
back
looking
at
the
little
summer
clouds
through
eyes
her
mood
appeared
to
have
changed
indeed
that
seemed
to
be
characteristic
of
her
that
her
lightness
was
not
so
much
the
lightness
of
thistle
down
which
is
ever
airy
the
sport
of
every
wind
but
rather
that
of
the
rose
vine
mobile
and
swaying
in
every
breeze
yet
at
the
same
time
rooted
well
in
the
wholesome
garden
earth
she
cared
now
to
be
silent
in
a
little
while
bennington
saw
that
she
had
fallen
asleep
for
the
first
time
he
looked
upon
her
face
in
absolute
repose
feature
by
feature
line
by
line
he
went
over
it
and
into
his
heart
crept
that
peculiar
yearning
which
seems
on
analysis
half
pity
for
what
has
past
and
half
fear
for
what
may
come
it
is
bestowed
on
little
children
and
on
those
whose
natures
in
spite
of
their
years
are
essentially
childlike
for
this
girl
face
was
so
pathetically
young
its
sensitive
lips
pouted
with
a
child
pout
its
pointed
chin
was
delicate
with
the
delicacy
that
is
lost
when
the
teeth
have
had
often
to
be
clenched
in
resolve
its
cheek
was
curved
so
softly
its
long
eyelashes
shaded
that
cheek
so
purely
yet
somewhere
like
an
intangible
spirit
which
dwelt
in
it
unseen
except
through
its
littlest
effects
bennington
seemed
to
trace
that
subtle
sadness
or
still
more
subtle
mystery
which
at
times
showed
so
strongly
in
her
eyes
he
caught
himself
puzzling
over
it
trying
to
seize
it
it
was
most
like
a
sorrow
and
yet
like
a
sorrow
which
had
been
outlived
or
if
a
mystery
it
was
as
a
mystery
which
was
such
only
to
others
no
longer
to
herself
the
whole
line
of
thought
was
too
for
bennington
untrained
perceptions
yet
again
all
at
once
he
realized
that
this
very
fact
was
one
of
the
girl
charms
to
him
that
her
mere
presence
stirred
in
him
perceptions
intuitions
thoughts
yes
even
powers
which
he
had
never
known
before
he
felt
that
she
developed
him
he
found
that
instead
of
being
weak
he
was
merely
latent
that
now
the
latent
perceptions
were
unfolding
since
he
had
known
her
he
had
felt
himself
more
of
a
man
more
ready
to
grapple
with
facts
and
conditions
on
his
own
behalf
more
inclined
to
take
his
own
view
of
the
world
and
to
act
on
it
she
had
given
him
independence
for
she
had
made
him
believe
in
himself
and
belief
in
one
self
is
the
first
principle
of
independence
bennington
de
laney
looked
back
on
his
old
new
york
self
as
on
a
being
infinitely
remote
she
awoke
and
opened
her
eyes
slowly
and
looked
at
him
without
blinking
the
sun
had
gone
nearly
to
the
ridge
top
and
a
thrush
was
celebrating
with
his
hollow
notes
the
artificial
twilight
of
its
shadow
she
smiled
at
him
a
little
vaguely
the
mists
of
sleep
clouding
her
eyes
it
is
the
unguarded
moment
the
instant
of
awakening
at
such
an
instant
the
mask
falls
from
before
the
features
of
the
soul
i
do
not
know
what
bennington
saw
mary
mary
he
cried
uncontrolledly
i
love
you
i
love
you
girl
he
had
never
before
seen
any
one
so
vexed
she
sat
up
at
once
oh
did
you
have
to
say
that
she
cried
angrily
why
did
you
have
to
spoil
things
why
could
you
have
let
it
go
along
as
it
was
without
bringing
into
it
she
arose
and
began
to
walk
angrily
up
and
down
kicking
aside
the
sticks
and
stones
as
she
encountered
them
i
was
just
beginning
to
like
you
and
now
you
do
this
i
am
so
angry
she
stamped
her
little
foot
i
thought
i
had
found
a
man
for
once
who
could
be
a
good
friend
to
me
whom
i
could
meet
unguardedly
and
behold
the
third
day
he
tells
me
this
i
am
sorry
stammered
bennington
his
new
tenderness
fleeing
frightened
into
the
inner
recesses
of
his
being
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
know
i
wo
say
it
again
please
the
declaration
had
been
manly
this
was
ridiculously
boyish
the
girl
frowned
at
him
in
two
minds
as
to
what
to
do
really
truly
he
assured
her
she
laughed
a
little
scornfully
very
well
i
give
you
one
more
chance
i
like
you
too
well
to
drop
you
entirely
what
an
air
of
autocracy
she
took
to
be
sure
you
must
speak
of
that
again
and
you
must
forget
it
entirely
she
lowered
at
him
a
delicious
picture
of
wrath
they
saddled
the
horses
and
took
their
way
homeward
in
silence
the
tenderness
put
out
its
flower
head
from
the
inner
sanctuary
apparently
the
coast
was
clear
it
ventured
a
little
further
the
evening
was
very
shadowy
and
sweet
and
musical
with
birds
the
tenderness
boldly
invaded
bennington
eyes
and
spoke
oh
so
timidly
from
his
lips
i
will
do
just
as
you
say
it
hesitated
and
i
be
very
very
good
indeed
but
am
i
to
have
no
hope
at
all
why
ca
you
keep
off
that
standpoint
entirely
just
that
one
question
then
i
will
well
grudgingly
i
suppose
nothing
on
earth
could
keep
the
average
mortal
from
hoping
but
i
ca
answer
that
there
is
any
ground
for
it
when
can
i
speak
of
it
again
i
do
know
after
the
pioneer
picnic
that
is
when
you
cease
to
be
a
mystery
is
it
she
sighed
that
is
when
i
become
a
greater
mystery
even
to
myself
i
fear
she
added
in
a
murmur
too
low
for
him
to
catch
they
rode
on
in
silence
for
a
little
space
more
the
night
shadows
were
flowing
down
between
the
trees
like
vapour
the
girl
of
her
own
accord
returned
to
the
subject
you
are
greatly
to
be
envied
she
said
a
little
sadly
for
you
are
really
young
i
am
old
oh
very
very
old
you
have
trust
and
confidence
i
have
not
i
can
sympathize
i
can
understand
but
that
is
all
there
is
something
within
me
that
binds
all
my
emotions
so
fast
that
i
can
not
give
way
to
them
i
want
to
i
wish
i
could
but
it
is
getting
harder
and
harder
for
me
to
think
of
absolutely
trusting
in
the
sense
of
giving
out
the
self
that
is
my
own
ah
but
you
are
to
be
envied
you
have
saved
up
and
accumulated
the
beautiful
in
your
nature
i
have
wasted
mine
and
now
i
sit
by
the
roadside
and
cry
for
it
my
only
hope
and
prayer
is
that
a
higher
and
better
something
will
be
given
me
in
place
of
the
wasted
and
yet
i
have
no
right
to
expect
it
silly
is
it
she
concluded
bitterly
bennington
made
no
reply
they
drew
near
the
gulch
and
could
hear
the
mellow
sound
of
bells
as
the
town
herd
defiled
slowly
down
it
toward
town
we
part
here
the
young
man
broke
the
long
silence
when
do
i
see
you
again
i
do
not
know
no
day
after
the
girl
shook
herself
from
a
reverie
if
you
want
me
to
believe
you
come
every
afternoon
to
the
rock
and
wait
some
day
i
will
meet
you
there
she
was
gone
chapter

old
mizzou
resigns
bennington
went
faithfully
to
the
rock
for
four
days
during
whole
afternoons
he
sat
there
looking
out
over
the
bad
lands
at
sunset
he
returned
to
camp
a
romance
of
all
gathered
dust
letters
home
remained
unwritten
prospecting
was
left
to
the
capable
hands
of
old
mizzou
until
much
to
bennington
surprise
that
individual
resigned
his
position
the
samples
lay
in
neatly
tied
coffee
sacks
just
outside
the
door
the
tabulations
and
statistics
only
needed
copying
to
prepare
them
for
the
capitalist
eye
the
information
necessary
to
the
understanding
of
them
reposed
in
a
grimy
notebook
requiring
merely
throwing
into
shape
as
a
letter
to
make
them
valuable
to
the
eastern
owner
of
the
property
anybody
could
do
that
old
mizzou
explained
these
things
to
bennington
does
this
jes
well
i
he
said
you
expresses
them
samples
east
so
as
they
kin
assay
an
you
sends
them
notes
and
statistics
then
all
they
is
to
do
is
to
pay
th
rest
of
the
boys
when
th
money
rolls
in
that
ai
none
of
my
funeral
but
there
the
assessment
work
bennington
objected
that
comes
along
all
right
i
aims
to
live
yere
in
the
camp
jest
same
as
usual
and
i
help
yo
git
started
when
aims
to
do
th
work
what
do
you
want
to
quit
for
then
if
you
live
here
you
may
as
well
draw
your
pay
no
sonny
that
ai
my
way
i
has
some
prospectin
of
my
own
to
do
an
as
long
as
i
is
a
employay
of
bishop
i
do
like
to
take
his
time
fer
my
work
bennington
thought
this
very
on
the
part
of
old
mizzou
very
well
he
agreed
i
write
bishop
oh
no
put
in
the
miner
hastily
no
need
to
trouble
i
resigns
in
writin
of
course
an
i
sees
to
it
myself
well
then
if
you
help
me
with
the
assessment
work
when
shall
we
begin
jest
now
reflected
old
mizzou
as
i
tells
you
i
wants
to
do
some
work
of
my
own
th
pioneer
picnic
i
reckons
the
pioneer
picnic
seemed
to
limit
many
things
bennington
shipped
the
ore
east
tabulated
the
statistics
and
wrote
his
report
about
two
weeks
later
he
received
a
letter
from
bishop
saying
that
the
assay
of
the
samples
had
been
very
poor
not
at
all
up
to
expectations
and
asking
some
further
information
as
to
the
latter
bennington
consulted
old
mizzou
the
miner
said
i
told
you
so
and
helped
on
the
answer
after
this
the
young
man
heard
nothing
further
from
his
employer
as
no
more
checks
came
from
the
east
he
found
himself
with
nothing
to
do
for
four
afternoons
as
has
been
said
he
fruitlessly
haunted
the
rock
on
the
fifth
morning
he
met
the
girl
on
horseback
she
was
quite
the
same
as
at
first
and
they
resumed
their
old
relations
as
if
the
fatal
picnic
had
never
taken
place
in
a
very
few
days
they
were
as
intimate
as
though
they
had
known
each
other
for
years
bennington
read
to
her
certain
rewritten
parts
of
a
romance
of
all
time
which
would
have
been
ridiculous
to
any
but
these
two
they
saw
it
through
the
glamour
of
youth
for
in
spite
of
her
assertions
of
great
age
the
girl
too
felt
the
whirl
of
that
elixir
in
her
veins
you
see
he
was
and
she
was
twenty
magic
years
more
venerable
than
threescore
and
ten
she
gave
him
sympathy
which
was
just
what
he
needed
for
the
sake
of
his
and
development
just
the
right
thing
for
him
in
that
effervescent
period
which
is
so
necessary
a
concomitant
of
growth
the
young
business
man
indulges
in
a
hundred
wild
schemes
to
be
corrected
by
older
heads
the
young
artist
paints
strange
impressionism
stranger
symbolism
and
perhaps
a
strangest
before
at
last
he
reaches
the
medium
of
his
individual
genius
the
young
writer
thinks
deep
and
philosophical
thoughts
which
he
expresses
in
measured
polysyllabic
language
he
dreams
wild
dreams
of
ideal
motive
which
he
sets
forth
in
beautiful
allegorical
tales
full
of
imagery
and
he
delights
in
rhetoric
rhetoric
whom
he
clasps
to
his
heart
and
believes
to
be
true
although
the
whole
world
declares
her
to
be
false
and
then
after
a
time
he
decides
not
to
introduce
a
new
system
of
metaphysics
but
to
tell
a
plain
story
plainly
ah
it
is
a
beautiful
time
to
those
who
dwell
in
it
and
such
a
funny
time
to
those
who
do
not
they
came
to
possess
an
influence
over
each
other
she
decided
how
they
should
meet
he
how
they
should
act
she
had
only
to
be
gay
and
he
was
gay
to
be
sad
and
he
was
sad
to
show
her
preference
for
serious
discourse
and
he
talked
quietly
of
serious
things
to
sigh
for
dreams
and
he
would
rhapsodize
it
sometimes
terrified
her
almost
when
she
saw
how
much
his
mood
depended
on
hers
but
once
the
mood
was
established
her
dominance
ceased
and
his
began
if
they
were
sad
or
gay
or
thoughtful
or
poetic
it
was
in
his
way
and
not
in
hers
he
took
the
lead
masterfully
and
perhaps
the
more
effectually
in
that
it
was
done
unconsciously
and
in
a
way
which
every
reader
will
understand
but
which
genius
alone
could
put
into
words
this
mutual
psychical
dependence
made
them
feel
the
need
of
each
other
more
strongly
than
any
merely
physical
dependence
ever
could
there
is
much
to
do
in
a
new
and
romantic
country
where
the
imminence
of
a
sordid
dreary
future
when
the
soil
will
raise
its
own
people
and
the
crop
will
be
poor
is
mercifully
veiled
the
future
then
counts
little
in
the
face
of
the
past
the
past
with
its
bearded
strong
men
of
other
lands
bringing
their
power
and
vigour
here
to
be
moulded
and
directed
by
the
influences
of
the
frontier
its
shadow
still
lies
over
the
land
they
did
it
all
the
rock
was
still
the
favourite
place
to
read
or
talk
crossbars
nailed
on
firmly
made
shinning
unnecessary
now
but
it
was
often
deserted
for
days
while
they
explored
bennington
had
bought
the
little
bronco
and
together
they
extended
their
investigations
of
the
country
in
all
directions
they
rode
to
spring
creek
valley
they
passed
the
range
over
into
custer
valley
once
they
climbed
harney
by
way
of
grizzly
gulch
thus
they
grew
to
know
the
hills
intimately
from
the
summit
of
the
rock
they
would
often
look
abroad
over
the
tangle
of
valleys
and
ridges
selecting
the
objective
points
for
their
next
expedition
many
surprises
awaited
them
for
they
found
that
here
as
everywhere
a
seemingly
uniform
exterior
covered
an
almost
infinite
variety
or
again
the
horses
were
given
a
rest
the
ripened
and
they
picked
hatfuls
then
followed
the
raspberries
on
the
stony
hills
they
walked
four
unnecessary
miles
to
see
a
forest
fire
and
six
to
buy
buckskin
work
from
a
band
of
sioux
who
had
come
up
into
the
timber
for
their
annual
supply
of
tepee
poles
they
taught
their
ponies
tricks
they
even
went
wading
together
like
two
small
children
in
a
pool
of
battle
creek
bennington
was
deliciously
carelessly
forgetfully
happy
only
there
was
jim
fay
that
individual
was
as
much
of
a
persecution
as
ever
and
he
seemed
to
enjoy
a
greater
intimacy
with
the
girl
than
did
the
easterner
he
did
not
see
her
as
often
as
did
the
latter
but
he
appeared
to
be
more
in
her
confidence

the
spires
of
stone
one
afternoon
they
had
pushed
over
back
of
harney
up
a
very
steep
little
trail
in
a
very
tiny
cañon
verdant
and
cool
all
at
once
the
trail
had
stood
straight
on
end
the
ponies
scrambled
up
somehow
and
they
found
themselves
on
a
narrow
open
splashed
with
green
moss
and
matted
with
an
aromatic
covering
of
pine
needles
beyond
the
easternmost
edge
of
the
plateau
stood
great
spires
of
stone
a
dozen
in
all
several
hundred
feet
high
and
of
solid
granite
they
soared
up
grandly
into
the
open
blue
like
so
many
cathedral
spires
drawing
about
them
that
air
of
solitude
and
stillness
which
accompanies
always
the
sublime
in
nature
even
boundless
space
was
amplified
at
the
bidding
of
their
solemn
uplifted
fingers
the
girl
reined
in
her
horse
oh
she
murmured
in
a
hushed
voice
i
feel
impertinent
as
though
i
were
intruding
a
squirrel
many
hundreds
of
feet
below
could
be
heard
faintly
barking
there
something
solemn
about
them
the
boy
agreed
in
the
same
tone
but
after
all
we
are
nothing
to
them
they
are
thinking
their
own
thoughts
far
above
everything
in
the
world
she
slipped
from
her
horse
let
sit
here
and
watch
them
she
said
i
want
to
look
at
them
and
them
they
sat
on
the
moss
and
stared
solemnly
across
at
the
great
spires
of
stone
they
are
waiting
for
something
there
she
observed
for
something
that
has
not
come
to
pass
and
they
are
looking
for
it
always
toward
the
east
do
you
see
how
they
are
waiting
yes
like
indian
warriors
wrapped
each
in
his
blanket
they
might
be
the
manitous
they
say
there
are
lots
of
them
in
the
hills
yes
of
course
she
cried
on
fire
with
the
idea
they
are
the
gods
of
the
people
and
they
are
waiting
for
something
that
is
coming
something
from
the
east
what
is
it
civilization
he
suggested
yes
and
when
this
something
this
civilization
comes
then
the
indians
are
to
be
destroyed
and
so
their
gods
are
always
watching
for
it
toward
the
east
and
he
went
on
when
it
comes
at
last
then
the
manitous
will
have
to
die
and
so
the
indians
know
that
their
hour
has
struck
when
these
great
stone
needles
fall
why
we
have
made
a
legend
she
exclaimed
with
wonder
they
stretched
out
on
their
backs
along
the
slope
and
stared
up
at
the
newly
dignified
manitous
in
delicious
silence
there
was
a
legend
once
you
remember
he
began
hesitatingly
the
first
day
we
were
on
the
rock
together
it
was
about
a
spirit
mountain
yes
i
remember
the
day
we
saw
the
shadow
you
said
you
tell
it
to
me
some
time
did
i
do
you
think
now
is
a
good
time
she
considered
a
moment
idly
why
yes
i
suppose
so
she
assented
after
a
pause
it
is
much
of
a
legend
though
she
clasped
her
hands
back
of
her
head
it
goes
like
this
she
began
comfortably
once
upon
a
time
when
the
world
was
very
young
there
was
an
evil
manitou
named
he
was
a
very
wicked
manitou
but
he
was
also
very
accomplished
for
he
could
change
himself
into
any
shape
he
wished
to
assume
and
he
could
travel
swifter
than
the
wind
but
he
was
also
very
wicked
in
old
times
the
centres
of
all
the
trees
were
fat
and
people
could
get
food
from
them
but
walked
through
the
forest
and
pushed
his
staff
down
through
the
middle
of
the
trunks
and
that
is
why
the
cores
of
the
trees
are
maple
sap
used
to
be
pure
sirup
once
too
but
diluted
it
with
rain
water
just
out
of
spite
but
there
was
one
peculiar
thing
about
he
could
not
cross
a
vein
of
gold
or
of
silver
there
was
some
sort
of
magic
in
them
that
turned
him
back
repelled
him
now
one
day
two
lovers
were
wandering
about
on
the
prairie
away
east
of
here
one
of
them
was
named
or
the
bird
lover
and
the
other
was
or
rippling
water
and
as
these
two
walked
over
the
plains
talking
together
along
came
the
evil
spirit
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
them
he
chased
them
intending
to
kill
them
and
drink
their
blood
as
was
his
custom
they
fled
far
over
the
prairie
everywhere
that
stepped
prairie
violets
grew
up
and
everywhere
that
stepped
a
lark
sprang
up
and
began
to
sing
but
the
wicked
gained
on
them
fast
for
he
could
run
very
swiftly
then
suddenly
they
saw
in
front
of
them
a
great
mountain
grown
with
pines
and
seamed
with
fissures
this
astonished
them
greatly
for
they
knew
there
were
no
mountains
in
the
prairie
country
at
all
but
they
had
no
time
to
spare
so
they
climbed
quickly
up
a
broad
cañon
and
concealed
themselves
now
when
the
wicked
manitou
came
along
he
tried
to
enter
the
cañon
too
but
he
had
to
stop
because
down
in
the
depths
of
the
mountain
were
veins
of
gold
and
silver
which
he
could
not
cross
for
many
days
he
raged
back
and
forth
but
in
vain
at
last
he
got
tired
and
went
away
then
and
who
had
been
living
quite
peacefully
on
the
game
with
which
the
mountain
swarmed
came
out
of
the
cañon
and
turned
toward
home
but
as
soon
as
they
had
set
foot
on
the
level
prairie
again
the
mountain
vanished
like
a
cloud
and
then
they
knew
they
had
been
aided
by
the
good
manitou
the
girl
arose
and
shook
her
skirt
free
of
the
pine
needles
that
clung
to
it
ever
since
then
she
went
on
eyeing
bennington
saucily
sideways
the
mountain
has
been
invisible
except
to
a
very
few
the
legend
says
that
when
a
maid
and
a
warrior
see
it
together
they
will
be
what
asked
bennington
as
she
paused
dead
within
the
year
she
cried
gaily
and
ran
lightly
to
her
pony
did
you
like
my
legend
she
asked
as
the
ponies
minced
down
the
steepest
of
the
trail
very
much
all
but
the
moral
do
you
want
to
die
not
a
bit
then
i
have
to
that
would
be
the
same
thing
and
bennington
dared
talk
in
this
way
for
the
next
day
began
the
pioneer
picnic
and
lately
she
had
been
very
kind
chapter
xiv
the
pioneer
picnic
the
lawtons
were
not
going
to
the
picnic
bennington
was
to
take
mary
down
to
rapid
where
the
girl
was
to
stay
with
a
certain
mcpherson
of
the
school
of
mines
an
early
start
was
accomplished
they
rode
down
the
gulch
through
the
dwarf
oaks
past
the
farthermost
point
and
so
out
into
the
hard
level
dirt
road
of
battle
creek
cañon
beyond
were
the
pines
and
a
rugged
road
full
of
dips
and
rises
turns
and
twists
hovering
on
edges
or
bosoming
itself
in
deep
cuts
mary
little
pony
cantered
recklessly
through
it
all
scampering
along
like
a
playful
dog
after
a
stone
leading
bennington
larger
animal
by
several
feet
he
had
full
leisure
to
notice
the
regular
flop
of
the
tam
over
the
lighter
dance
of
the
hair
the
increasing
rosiness
of
the
cheeks
dimpled
into
almost
continual
laughter
to
catch
stray
snatches
of
gay
little
remarks
thrown
out
at
random
as
they
tore
along
after
a
time
they
drew
out
from
the
shadow
of
the
pines
into
the
clearing
at
rockerville
where
the
hydraulic
giants
had
eaten
away
the
and
left
in
them
ugly
unhealed
sores
then
more
rough
roads
from
which
occasionally
would
open
for
a
moment
broad
vistas
of
endless
glades
clear
as
parks
breathless
descents
or
sharp
steep
cuts
at
the
bottom
of
which
spring
creek
or
as
much
of
it
as
was
not
turned
into
the
rockerville
sluices
brawled
or
idled
along
it
was
time
for
lunch
so
they
dismounted
near
a
deep
still
pool
and
ate
the
ponies
cropped
the
sparse
grasses
or
twisted
on
their
backs
all
four
legs
in
the
air
squirrels
chattered
and
scolded
overhead
some
of
the
jays
of
the
lowlands
shot
in
long
level
flight
between
the
trees
the
girl
and
the
boy
helped
each
other
hindered
each
other
playing
here
and
there
near
the
question
but
swerving
always
deliciously
just
in
time
after
lunch
more
riding
through
more
pines
the
road
dipped
strongly
once
then
again
and
then
abruptly
the
forest
ceased
and
they
found
themselves
cantering
over
broad
rolling
meadows
with
grasses
from
which
meadow
larks
rose
in
all
directions
like
grasshoppers
soon
after
they
passed
the
canvas
schooners
of
some
who
had
started
the
evening
before
down
the
next
long
slope
the
ponies
dropped
cautiously
with
bunched
feet
and
tentative
steps
spring
creek
was
forded
for
the
last
time
another
steep
grassy
hill
was
surmounted
and
they
looked
abroad
into
rapid
valley
and
over
to
the
prairie
beyond
behind
them
the
hills
lay
dark
with
the
everlasting
greenery
of
the
north
even
low
with
only
harney
to
raise
its
front
above
the
rest
of
the
range
as
though
by
a
common
impulse
they
reined
in
their
horses
and
looked
back
i
wonder
just
where
the
rock
is
she
mused
they
tried
to
guess
at
its
location
the
treeless
ridge
on
which
they
were
now
standing
ran
like
a
belt
outside
the
hills
they
journeyed
along
its
summit
until
late
in
the
afternoon
and
then
all
at
once
found
the
city
of
rapid
lying
below
them
at
the
mouth
of
a
mighty
cañon
like
a
toy
village
on
fine
velvet
brown
in
the
city
they
separated
mary
going
to
the
mcphersons
bennington
to
the
hotel
it
was
now
near
to
sunset
so
it
was
agreed
that
bennington
was
to
come
round
the
following
morning
to
get
her
at
the
hotel
bennington
spent
an
interesting
evening
viewing
the
pioneers
with
their
variety
of
costume
manners
and
speech
he
heard
many
good
stories
humorous
and
and
it
was
very
late
before
he
finally
got
to
bed
the
immediate
consequence
was
that
he
was
equally
late
to
breakfast
he
hurried
through
that
meal
and
stepped
out
into
the
street
with
the
intention
of
hastening
to
mcpherson
for
mary
but
this
he
found
to
be
impossible
because
of
the
overcrowded
condition
of
the
streets
the
sports
of
the
day
had
already
begun
from
curb
to
curb
the
way
was
jammed
with
a
dense
mass
of
men
women
and
children
through
whom
he
had
to
worm
his
way
after
ten
feet
of
this
he
heard
his
name
called
and
looking
up
caught
sight
of
mary
herself
perched
on
a
box
frantically
waving
a
handkerchief
in
his
direction
you
a
nice
one
she
cried
in
mock
reproach
as
he
struggled
toward
her
her
eyes
were
bright
and
her
cheeks
flew
red
signals
of
enjoyment
bennington
explained
i
know
well
it
did
matter
any
way
i
just
captured
this
box
climb
up
there
room
i
lost
the
doctor
and
mcpherson
already
two
mounted
men
decorated
with
huge
tin
marshals
badges
rode
slowly
along
forcing
the
crowd
back
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
the
first
horse
race
was
on
suddenly
there
was
an
eager
scramble
a
cloud
of
dust
a
swift
impression
of
dim
ghostlike
figures
it
was
over
the
crowd
flowed
into
the
street
again
the
two
pressed
together
hand
in
hand
on
the
top
of
the
box
they
laughed
at
each
other
and
everything
something
beautiful
was
very
near
to
them
for
this
was
the
pioneer
picnic
and
both
remembered
that
the
pioneer
picnic
marked
the
limit
of
many
things
what
next
what
next
she
called
excitedly
to
a
tall
young
cattleman
the
cowboy
looked
up
at
her
and
his
face
relaxed
into
a
pleased
smile
why
it
a
drillin
match
over
in
the
next
street
miss
he
answered
politely
you
better
run
right
along
over
and
get
a
good
place
he
glanced
at
de
laney
smiled
again
and
turned
away
apparently
to
follow
his
own
advice
come
on
we
follow
him
cried
mary
jumping
down
and
abandon
our
box
objected
bennington
but
she
was
already
in
full
pursuit
of
the
tall
cowboy
the
ring
around
the
large
boulder
dragged
by
mule
team
from
the
hills
had
just
begun
to
form
when
they
arrived
so
they
were
enabled
to
secure
good
places
near
the
front
rank
where
they
kneeled
on
their
handkerchiefs
and
the
crowd
hemmed
them
in
at
the
back
the
drilling
match
was
to
determine
which
pair
of
contestants
could
in
a
given
time
with
sledge
and
drill
cut
the
deepest
hole
in
a
granite
boulder
to
one
who
stood
apart
the
sight
must
have
been
picturesque
in
the
extreme
the
white
dust
stirred
by
restless
feet
rose
lazily
across
the
heated
air
the
sun
shone
down
clear
and
hot
with
a
certain
glare
that
is
seen
only
in
the
rarefied
atmosphere
of
the
west
around
the
outer
edge
of
the
ring
hovered
a
few
anxious
small
boys
agonized
that
they
were
missing
part
of
the
show
stolidly
indifferent
indians
wrapped
close
in
their
blankets
smoked
silently
awaiting
the
next
pony
race
the
riders
of
which
were
skylarking
about
trying
to
pull
each
other
from
their
horses
backs
when
the
last
pair
had
finished
the
judges
measured
the
depths
of
the
holes
drilled
and
announced
the
victors
the
crowd
shouted
and
broke
for
the
saloons
the
latter
had
been
plying
a
brisk
business
so
that
men
were
about
ready
to
embrace
in
brotherhood
or
in
battle
with
equal
alacrity
suddenly
it
was
the
dinner
hour
the
crowd
broke
bennington
and
mary
realized
they
had
been
wandering
about
hand
in
hand
they
directed
their
steps
toward
the
mcphersons
with
the
greatest
propriety
it
was
a
glorious
picnic
the
house
was
gratefully
cool
and
dark
after
the
summer
heat
out
of
doors
the
little
doctor
sat
in
the
darkest
room
and
dissertated
cannily
on
the
strange
variety
of
subjects
which
a
scotchman
can
always
bring
up
on
the
most
ordinary
occasions
the
doctor
was
not
only
a
learned
man
as
was
evidenced
by
his
position
in
the
school
of
mines
and
his
wonderful
collections
but
was
a
scout
of
long
standing
a
physician
of
merit
and
an
indian
authority
of
acknowledged
weight
withal
he
was
so
modest
that
these
things
became
known
only
by
implication
or
hearsay
never
by
direct
evidence
mcpherson
was
not
scotch
at
all
but
plain
comfortable
american
redolent
of
wholesome
cleanliness
and
good
temper
and
beaming
with
kindliness
and
round
spectacles
never
was
such
a
doctor
never
was
such
a
mcpherson
never
was
such
a
dinner
and
they
brought
in
coffee
in
small
cups
ah
ha
de
laney
laughed
the
doctor
who
had
been
watching
him
with
quizzical
eye
we
pretty
bad
but
we
are
got
quite
to
savagery
yet
bennington
hastened
to
disavow
that
all
right
the
doctor
reassured
him
that
all
right
i
did
wonder
at
ye
in
this
country
but
mcpherson
and
mysel
jest
take
a
wee
trip
occasionally
to
keep
our
wits
bright
is
it
so
mrs
mac
it
is
that
said
she
with
a
doubtful
inner
thought
as
to
the
propriety
of
offering
cream
and
as
for
you
went
on
the
doctor
dissertatively
i
suppose
getting
to
be
somewhat
of
a
miner
yourself
i
mind
me
we
did
a
bit
of
assay
work
for
your
people
the
other
day
the
crazy
horse
was
it
a
good
claim
i
should
judge
from
the
sample
and
so
i
wrote
davidson
when
was
this
asked
the
easterner
puzzled
the
last
week
i
did
know
he
had
had
any
assaying
done
o
weel
said
the
doctor
comfortably
it
may
not
have
occurred
to
him
to
report
yet
it
was
rich
mcpherson
let
talk
about
dresses
called
mary
across
the
table
here
we
come
down
for
a
and
they
insist
on
talking
mining
and
so
the
subject
was
dropped
but
bennington
could
not
get
it
out
of
his
mind
why
should
mizzou
have
had
the
crazy
horse
assayed
without
saying
anything
about
it
to
him
why
had
he
not
reported
the
result
how
did
it
happen
that
the
doctor
assistants
had
found
the
ore
rich
when
the
company
assayers
east
had
proved
it
poor
why
should
mizzou
have
it
assayed
at
all
since
he
was
no
longer
connected
with
the
company
but
above
all
supposing
he
had
done
this
with
the
intention
of
keeping
it
secret
from
bennington
what
possible
benefit
or
advantage
could
the
old
man
derive
from
such
an
action
he
puzzled
over
this
it
seemed
to
still
the
effervescence
of
his
joy
he
realized
suddenly
that
he
had
been
very
careless
in
a
great
many
respects
the
work
had
all
been
trusted
to
davidson
while
he
often
had
never
even
seen
it
he
had
been
entirely
occupied
with
the
girl
he
experienced
that
sudden
sinking
feeling
which
always
comes
to
a
man
whom
neglected
duty
wakes
from
pleasure
what
was
davidson
object
could
it
be
that
he
hoped
to
buy
in
a
rich
claim
at
a
low
figure
and
to
that
end
had
sent
poor
samples
east
the
more
he
thought
of
this
the
more
reasonable
it
seemed
his
resignation
was
for
the
purpose
of
putting
him
in
the
position
of
outside
purchaser
he
resolved
to
carry
through
the
affair
diplomatically
during
the
afternoon
he
ruminated
on
how
this
was
to
be
done
mary
could
not
understand
his
preoccupation
it
piqued
her
a
slight
strangeness
sprang
up
between
them
which
he
was
too
to
notice
finally
as
he
tumbled
into
bed
that
night
an
idea
so
brilliant
came
to
him
that
he
sat
bolt
upright
in
sheer
delight
at
his
own
astuteness
he
would
ask
mcpherson
for
a
copy
of
the
assays
if
his
suspicions
were
correct
these
assays
would
represent
the
richest
samples
he
would
send
them
at
once
to
bishop
with
a
statement
of
the
case
in
that
manner
putting
the
capitalist
on
his
guard
there
was
something
exquisitely
humorous
to
him
in
the
idea
of
thus
turning
to
his
own
use
the
information
which
davidson
had
accumulated
for
his
fraudulent
purposes
he
went
to
sleep
chuckling

the
girl
on
the
train
the
next
morning
the
young
man
had
quite
regained
his
good
spirits
the
girl
on
the
other
hand
was
rather
quiet
mcpherson
made
no
objections
to
furnishing
a
copy
of
the
assays
the
records
however
were
at
the
school
of
mines
he
drove
down
to
get
them
and
in
the
interim
the
two
young
people
at
suggestion
went
to
see
the
train
come
in
the
platform
of
the
station
was
filled
to
suffocation
assuming
that
the
crowd
intention
was
to
view
the
unaccustomed
locomotive
it
was
strange
it
did
not
occur
to
them
that
the
opposite
side
of
the
track
or
the
adjacent
prairie
would
afford
more
elbow
room
they
huddled
together
on
the
boards
of
the
platform
as
though
the
appearance
of
the
spectacle
depended
on
every
last
individual
keeping
his
feet
from
the
naked
earth
they
pushed
here
and
there
expostulating
calling
to
one
another
facetiously
looking
anxiously
down
the
straight
dwindling
track
for
the
first
glimpse
of
the
locomotive
mary
and
bennington
found
themselves
caught
up
at
once
into
the
vortex
after
a
few
moments
of
desperate
clinging
together
they
were
forced
into
the
front
row
where
they
stood
on
the
very
edge
braced
back
against
the
pressure
half
laughing
half
vexed
the
train
drew
in
with
a
grinding
rush
from
the
step
swung
the
conductor
faces
looked
from
the
open
windows
on
the
platform
of
one
of
the
last
cars
stood
a
young
girl
and
three
men
one
of
the
men
was
elderly
with
white
hair
and
side
whiskers
the
other
two
were
young
and
well
dressed
the
girl
was
of
our
best
patrician
type
the
type
that
may
know
little
think
little
say
little
and
generally
amount
to
little
and
yet
carry
its
negative
qualities
with
so
used
an
air
of
polite
society
as
to
raise
them
by
sheer
force
to
the
dignity
of
positive
virtues
from
head
to
foot
she
was
faultlessly
groomed
from
eye
to
attitude
she
was
languidly
superior
the
impolitic
would
say
bored
yet
every
feature
of
her
appearance
and
bearing
even
to
the
very
tips
of
her
enamelled
and
sensibly
thick
boots
implied
that
she
was
of
a
different
class
from
the
ordinary
and
satisfied
on
common
people
that
impulse
which
attracts
her
lesser
sisters
to
the
vulgar
menagerie
she
belonged
to
the
proper
street
at
the
proper
time
of
day
any
one
acquainted
with
the
species
would
have
known
at
once
that
this
trip
to
deadwood
was
to
please
the
gentleman
with
the
side
whiskers
and
that
it
was
made
bearable
only
by
the
two
individuals
in
the
background
she
caught
sight
of
the
pair
directly
in
front
of
her
and
raised
her
lorgnette
with
a
languid
wrist
her
stare
was
from
the
standpoint
bennington
was
not
used
to
it
for
the
moment
he
had
the
fifth
avenue
feeling
and
knew
that
he
was
not
properly
dressed
therefore
naturally
he
was
confused
he
lowered
his
head
and
blushed
a
little
then
he
became
conscious
that
mary
clear
eyes
were
examining
him
in
a
very
troubled
fashion
three
hours
and
a
half
afterward
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
she
might
have
thought
he
had
blushed
and
lowered
his
head
because
he
was
ashamed
to
be
seen
by
this
other
girl
in
her
company
but
it
was
then
too
late
the
train
pulled
out
the
westerners
at
once
scattered
in
all
directions
half
an
hour
later
the
choking
cloud
dusts
rose
like
smoke
from
the
different
trails
that
led
north
or
south
or
west
to
the
heart
of
the
hills
the
picnic
is
over
he
suggested
gently
at
their
noon
camping
place
yes
thank
heaven
you
remember
your
promise
what
promise
that
you
would
explain
your
i
changed
my
mind
a
leaf
floated
slowly
down
the
wind
a
raven
croaked
the
breeze
made
the
sunbeams
waver
mary
the
picnic
is
over
he
repeated
again
very
gently
yes
yes
yes
i
love
you
mary
the
raven
spread
his
wings
and
flew
away
do
you
love
me
he
insisted
gently
i
want
you
to
come
to
dinner
at
our
house
noon
that
is
a
strange
answer
mary
it
is
all
the
answer
you
get
why
are
you
so
cross
is
anything
the
matter
nothing
i
love
you
mary
i
love
you
girl
at
least
i
can
say
that
now
yes
you
can
say
it
now
chapter
xvi
a
noon
dinner
bennington
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
his
invitation
at
one
moment
he
told
himself
it
must
mean
that
mary
loved
him
and
that
she
wished
him
to
meet
her
parents
on
that
account
at
the
next
he
tormented
himself
with
the
conviction
that
she
thus
merely
avoided
the
issue
between
these
moods
he
alternated
without
being
able
to
abide
in
either
he
forgot
all
about
old
mizzou
promptly
at
noon
the
following
day
he
turned
up
the
little
trail
for
the
first
time
the
lawton
house
he
found
first
of
all
to
be
scrupulously
neat
it
stood
on
a
knoll
as
do
most
gulch
cabins
in
order
that
occasional
freshets
might
pass
below
and
the
knoll
looked
as
though
it
had
been
clipped
with
a
pair
of
scissors
not
a
crooked
little
juniper
bush
was
allowed
to
intrude
its
plebeian
sprawl
among
the
dignified
pines
and
the
gracefully
infrequent
bushes
in
front
of
the
cabin
itself
was
a
rockery
of
pink
quartz
on
which
were
piled
elk
antlers
the
building
was
of
two
low
stories
had
a
veranda
with
a
railing
and
possessed
various
ornamental
wood
edgings
all
of
which
were
painted
the
whole
affair
was
mathematically
squared
and
correspondingly
neat
some
boxes
and
pots
of
flowers
adorned
the
window
ledges
bennington
knock
was
answered
by
an
elderly
woman
who
introduced
herself
at
once
as
lawton
she
commenced
a
voluble
and
slightly
embarrassed
explanation
of
how
she
would
be
down
in
a
moment
or
so
at
the
same
time
leading
the
way
into
the
parlour
while
this
explanation
was
going
forward
bennington
had
a
good
chance
to
examine
his
hostess
and
her
surroundings
lawton
was
of
the
fat
but
energetic
variety
she
fairly
shone
with
cleanliness
and
with
an
insistent
determination
to
keep
busy
you
could
see
that
all
the
time
her
tongue
was
uttering
polite
platitudes
concerning
the
weather
her
mind
was
hovering
like
a
dragon
fly
over
this
or
that
flower
of
domestic
economy
she
was
one
of
the
women
who
carry
their
housekeeping
to
a
perfection
uncomfortable
both
to
herself
and
everybody
else
and
then
delude
themselves
into
the
martyrlike
belief
that
she
is
doing
it
all
entirely
for
others
as
a
consequence
she
exhibited
much
of
the
time
an
aggrieved
air
that
comported
but
ludicrously
with
her
tendency
to
bustle
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
in
other
ways
lawton
was
ludicrous
her
dumpy
little
form
was
dressed
in
the
loudest
of
prints
the
figures
of
which
turned
her
into
a
huge
flower
bed
of
brilliant
blooms
over
this
chaos
of
colours
peered
her
round
little
face
with
its
snapping
eyes
she
discoursed
in
sentences
which
began
coherently
but
frayed
out
soon
into
nothingness
under
the
stress
of
inner
thought
i
do
see
where
that
husban
of
mine
is
i
reckon
you
think
we
just
awful
rude
de
laney
and
that
gal
an
maude
i
declare
it
jest
enough
to
try
any
one
patience
it
surely
is
you
no
idea
de
laney
what
with
the
hens
settin
and
this
dry
spell
that
sends
dust
all
over
everything
and
every
one
behin
hand
on
everythin
her
eye
was
becoming
vacant
as
she
wondered
about
certain
biscuits
i
sure
it
must
be
agreed
bennington
uncomfortably
what
was
i
you
must
excuse
me
de
laney
but
you
being
a
man
can
have
no
idea
of
the
life
us
poor
women
folks
lead
our
very
lives
away
to
keep
things
runnin
and
then
no
thanks
fer
it
all
i
just
like
t
see
bill
lawton
try
it
jest
one
he
be
a
ravin
lunatic
an
thet
i
tell
him
often
this
jest
awful
too
i
tell
him
he
must
get
out
sometimes
and
i
he
will
when
he
made
his
pile
poor
man
an
then
we
have
a
chanst
to
go
back
east
again
when
we
lived
east
de
laney
we
had
a
house
not
like
this
little
shack
a
good
house
with
nigh
on
to
a
dozen
rooms
and
i
had
a
gal
to
help
me
and
some
chanst
to
buy
things
once
in
a
while
but
now
that
bill
lawton
moved
west
what
goin
to
become
o
me
i
do
know
i
nigh
wore
out
with
it
all
then
you
lived
east
once
asked
bennington
law
yes
we
lived
in
illinoy
once
and
th
lord
only
knows
i
wisht
we
lived
there
yet
though
the
farmin
was
a
sight
of
work
and
no
pay
sometimes
the
inner
doubts
as
to
the
biscuits
proved
too
much
for
her
heaven
knows
you
ai
t
git
much
to
eat
she
cried
jumping
up
but
you
ai
goin
to
git
anythin
a
tall
if
i
do
run
right
off
and
tend
to
them
biscuit
she
bustled
out
bennington
had
time
then
to
notice
the
decorations
of
the
parlour
they
offered
to
the
eye
a
strange
mixture
of
the
east
and
west
reminiscences
of
the
old
home
in
illinoy
and
trophies
of
the
new
on
the
frontier
from
the
ceiling
hung
a
heavy
lamp
with
prismatic
danglers
surrounded
by
a
globe
on
which
were
depicted
stags
in
the
act
of
leaping
gates
by
way
of
complement
to
this
gorgeous
centrepiece
the
paper
on
the
walls
showed
in
infinitely
recurring
duplicate
a
huntress
in
green
habit
and
big
hat
carrying
on
a
desperate
flirtation
with
a
young
man
in
the
habiliments
of
the
fifteenth
century
while
across
the
background
a
huddle
of
dogs
pursued
a
mammoth
deer
mathematically
beneath
the
lamp
stood
a
table
covered
with
a
spread
on
the
table
was
a
glass
bell
underneath
which
were
wax
flowers
and
a
robin
in
one
angle
of
the
room
austerely
huddled
a
whatnot
of
four
shelves
two
china
pugs
and
a
statuette
of
a
simpering
pair
of
children
under
a
massive
umbrella
adorned
this
article
of
furniture
on
the
wall
ticked
an
square
wooden
clock
the
floor
was
concealed
by
a
rag
carpet
so
much
for
the
east
the
west
contributed
brilliant
green
copper
ore
flaky
white
tin
ore
glittering
white
quartz
ore
shining
pyrites
and
one
or
two
businesslike
specimens
of
oxygenated
quartz
all
of
which
occupied
points
of
exhibit
on
the
whatnot
over
the
carpet
were
spread
a
deer
skin
and
a
rug
made
from
the
hide
of
a
timber
wolf
bennington
found
all
this
interesting
but
depressing
he
was
glad
when
lawton
returned
and
took
up
her
voluble
discourse
in
the
midst
of
a
dissertation
on
the
relation
of
corn
meal
to
eggs
the
door
opened
and
lawton
sidled
in
oh
here
y
are
at
last
observed
his
spouse
scornfully
and
rattled
on
lawton
nodded
awkwardly
and
perched
himself
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
he
had
assumed
an
suit
of
store
clothes
in
which
he
unaccustomedly
writhed
and
evidently
to
judge
from
the
sleekness
of
his
hair
had
recently
plunged
his
head
in
a
pail
of
water
he
said
nothing
but
whenever
lawton
was
not
looking
he
winked
elaborately
and
solemnly
at
bennington
as
though
to
imply
that
circumstances
alone
prevented
any
more
open
show
of
cordiality
at
last
catching
the
young
man
eye
at
a
more
than
usually
propitious
moment
he
went
through
the
pantomime
of
opening
a
bottle
then
furtively
arose
and
disappeared
lawton
remembering
her
cakes
ran
out
bennington
was
left
alone
again
he
had
not
spoken
six
words
the
door
slowly
opened
and
another
member
of
the
family
sidled
in
bennington
owned
a
helpless
feeling
that
this
was
a
sort
of
show
and
that
these
various
actors
in
it
were
parading
their
entrances
and
their
exits
before
him
or
that
he
himself
were
the
object
of
inspection
on
whom
the
others
were
satisfying
their
own
curiosity
the
newcomer
was
a
child
a
little
girl
about
eight
or
ten
years
old
bennington
liked
children
as
a
usual
thing
no
one
on
earth
could
have
become
possessed
in
this
one
favour
she
was
a
creature
of
regular
but
mean
features
extreme
gravity
and
evidently
of
an
inquiring
disposition
on
seeing
her
for
the
first
time
one
sophisticated
would
have
expected
a
deluge
of
questions
bennington
did
but
she
merely
stood
and
stared
without
winking
hullo
little
girl
bennington
greeted
her
uneasily
the
creature
only
stared
the
harder
my
doll
name
is
garnet
she
observed
suddenly
with
a
nasal
accent
after
this
interesting
bit
of
information
another
silence
fell
what
is
your
name
little
girl
bennington
asked
desperately
at
last
maude
remarked
the
phenomenon
briefly
this
statement
she
delivered
in
that
whining
tone
which
the
extremely
infant
imagines
to
indicate
playful
childishness
she
approached
d
you
want
t
see
my
picters
she
whimpered
confidingly
bennington
expressed
his
delight
for
seven
geological
ages
did
he
gaze
upon
cheap
and
horrible
woodcuts
of
gentlemen
in
fashionable
raiment
trying
to
lean
against
conspicuously
inadequate
rustic
gates
equally
fashionable
ladies
with
flat
chests
and
rat
nest
hair
and
animals
whose
attitudes
denoted
playful
sportiveness
of
disposition
each
of
these
pictures
was
explained
in
minute
detail
bennington
distress
became
apathy
lawton
returned
from
the
cakes
presently
yet
her
voice
seemed
to
break
in
on
the
duration
of
centuries
now
maude
she
exclaimed
with
a
proper
maternal
pride
you
be
botherin
the
gentleman
she
paused
to
receive
the
expected
disclaimer
it
was
made
albeit
a
little
weakly
maude
is
very
good
with
her
book
she
explained
miss
brown
that
the
school
teacher
that
comes
over
from
hill
town
summers
she
says
maude
reads
a
sight
better
than
lots
as
is
two
or
three
years
older
now
how
old
would
you
think
she
was
de
laney
de
laney
tried
to
appraise
while
the
object
hung
her
head
and
twisted
her
feet
he
had
no
idea
of
ages
about
eleven
he
guessed
with
an
air
of
wisdom
jest
eight
an
a
half
cried
the
dame
folding
her
hands
triumphantly
she
let
her
fond
maternal
gaze
rest
on
the
prodigy
suddenly
she
darted
forward
with
extraordinary
agility
for
one
so
well
endowed
with
flesh
and
seized
her
offspring
in
relentless
grasp
i
do
declare
maude
eliza
she
exclaimed
in
tones
you
ai
washed
your
ears
you
come
with
me
they
disappeared
in
a
blue
mist
of
wails
as
though
this
were
his
cue
the
crafty
features
of
lawton
appeared
cautiously
in
the
doorway
bestowed
a
furtive
and
searching
inspection
on
the
room
and
finally
winked
solemnly
at
its
only
occupant
a
hand
was
inserted
the
forefinger
beckoned
bennington
arose
wearily
and
went
out
lawton
led
the
way
to
a
little
oat
shed
standing
at
some
distance
from
the
house
behind
this
he
paused
from
beneath
his
coat
he
drew
a
round
bottle
and
two
glass
tumblers
no
joke
skippin
th
ole
lady
he
chuckled
in
an
undertone
he
poured
out
a
liberal
portion
for
himself
and
passed
the
bottle
along
bennington
was
unwilling
to
hurt
the
old
fellow
feelings
after
he
had
taken
so
much
trouble
on
his
account
but
he
was
equally
unwilling
to
drink
the
whisky
so
he
threw
it
away
when
lawton
was
not
looking
they
walked
leisurely
toward
the
house
lawton
explaining
various
improvements
in
a
loud
tone
of
voice
intended
more
to
lull
his
suspicions
than
to
edify
the
young
man
the
lady
looked
on
them
sternly
and
announced
dinner
at
the
table
bennington
found
mary
already
seated
the
easterner
was
placed
next
to
lawton
at
his
other
hand
was
maude
eliza
mary
sat
opposite
throughout
the
meal
she
said
little
and
only
looked
up
from
her
plate
when
bennington
attention
was
called
another
way
her
mere
presence
however
seemed
to
open
to
the
young
man
a
different
point
of
view
he
found
lawton
lengthy
dissertations
amusing
he
considered
lawton
in
the
light
of
a
unique
character
and
maude
eliza
while
as
disagreeable
as
ever
came
in
for
various
excuses
and
explanations
on
her
own
behalf
in
the
young
man
mind
he
became
more
responsive
he
told
a
number
of
very
good
stories
at
which
the
others
laughed
he
detailed
some
experiences
of
his
own
at
places
in
the
world
far
remote
selected
it
must
be
confessed
with
some
slight
reference
to
their
dazzling
effect
on
the
company
without
actually
showing
off
he
managed
to
get
the
effect
of
it
the
result
of
his
efforts
was
to
harmonize
to
some
extent
these
diverse
elements
lawton
became
more
coherent
lawton
more
communicative
maude
eliza
stopped
whining
occasionally
and
temporarily
bennington
had
rarely
been
in
such
high
spirits
he
was
surprised
himself
but
then
was
not
that
day
of
moment
to
him
and
would
he
not
have
been
a
strange
sort
of
individual
to
have
seen
in
the
world
aught
but
brightness
but
mary
responded
not
at
all
rather
as
bennington
arose
she
fell
until
at
last
she
hardly
even
moved
in
her
place
chirk
up
chirk
up
cried
lawton
gaily
for
her
i
know
some
one
who
ought
to
be
happy
anyhow
she
glanced
meaningly
from
one
to
the
other
and
laughed
heartily
bennington
felt
a
momentary
disgust
at
her
tactlessness
but
covered
it
with
some
laughing
sally
of
his
own
the
meal
broke
up
in
great
good
humour
lawton
and
maude
eliza
remained
to
clear
away
the
dishes
lawton
remarked
that
he
must
get
back
to
work
and
shook
hands
in
farewell
most
elaborately
bennington
laughingly
promised
them
all
that
he
would
surely
come
again
then
he
escaped
and
followed
mary
up
the
hill
surmising
truly
enough
that
she
had
gone
on
toward
the
rock
he
thought
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
through
the
elders
he
hastened
his
footsteps
at
this
he
stumbled
slightly
from
his
pocket
fell
a
letter
he
had
received
that
morning
he
picked
it
up
and
looked
at
it
idly
it
was
from
his
mother
and
covered
a
number
of
pages
as
he
was
about
to
thrust
it
back
into
his
pocket
a
single
sentence
caught
his
eye
it
read
sally
ogletree
gave
a
supper
last
week
which
was
a
very
pretty
affair
he
stopped
short
on
the
trail
and
the
world
seemed
to
go
black
around
him
he
almost
fell
then
resumed
his
way
but
step
now
was
hesitating
and
slow
and
he
walked
with
his
eyes
bent
thoughtfully
on
the
ground
chapter

noblesse
oblige
the
thought
which
caused
bennington
de
lane
so
suddenly
look
grave
was
suggested
by
the
sentence
in
his
mother
letter
for
the
first
time
he
realized
that
these
people
up
to
now
so
amusing
were
possibly
destined
to
come
into
intimate
relations
with
himself
old
bill
lawton
was
mary
father
while
lawton
was
mary
mother
maude
was
mary
sister
the
next
instant
a
great
rush
of
love
into
his
heart
drove
this
feeling
from
it
what
matter
anything
provided
she
loved
him
and
he
loved
her
generous
sentiment
so
filled
him
that
there
was
room
for
nothing
else
he
even
experienced
dimly
in
the
depths
of
his
consciousness
a
faint
pale
joy
that
in
thus
accepting
what
was
disagreeable
to
his
finer
sensibilities
he
was
proving
more
truly
to
his
own
self
the
boundlessness
of
his
love
for
the
moment
he
was
exalted
by
this
instant
revulsion
against
anything
calculating
in
his
passion
and
then
slowly
one
by
one
the
objections
stole
back
like
a
flock
of
noisome
sombre
creatures
put
to
flight
by
a
sudden
movement
but
now
returning
to
their
old
nesting
places
the
very
unassuming
method
of
their
recurrence
lent
them
an
added
influence
almost
before
bennington
knew
it
they
had
established
a
case
and
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
very
ugly
problem
perhaps
it
will
be
a
little
difficult
for
the
average
and
democratic
reader
to
realize
fully
the
terrible
proportions
of
this
problem
we
whose
lives
assume
little
require
little
of
them
intangible
objections
to
the
desires
of
our
hearts
do
not
count
for
much
against
their
realization
there
needs
the
rough
attrition
of
reality
to
turn
back
our
calm
complacent
acquisition
of
that
which
we
see
to
be
for
our
best
interest
in
the
emotional
world
claims
of
ancestry
mean
nothing
claims
of
society
mean
not
much
more
claims
of
wealth
are
considered
as
evanescent
among
a
class
of
men
who
by
their
efforts
and
genius
are
able
to
render
absolute
wealth
itself
an
evanescent
quality
when
one
of
us
loves
he
questions
the
worth
of
the
object
of
his
passion
that
established
nothing
else
is
of
great
importance
there
is
a
grand
and
noble
quality
in
this
but
it
misses
much
about
the
other
state
of
affairs
wherein
the
woman
appurtenances
of
all
kinds
as
well
as
the
woman
herself
are
significant
is
a
delicate
and
subtle
aura
of
the
higher
refinement
the
long
refinement
of
the
spirit
through
many
generations
which
to
an
eye
accustomed
to
look
for
gradations
of
moral
beauty
possesses
a
iridescence
of
its
own
from
one
point
of
view
the
forms
of
thought
and
courtesy
are
stilted
and
useless
from
another
they
retain
still
the
lofty
dignity
of
so
we
would
have
none
set
down
bennington
de
laney
as
a
prig
or
a
snob
because
he
did
not
at
once
decide
for
his
heart
as
against
his
aristocratic
instincts
not
only
all
his
early
education
but
the
life
lessons
of
many
generations
of
ancestors
had
taught
him
to
set
a
fictitious
value
on
social
position
he
was
a
de
laney
on
both
sides
he
had
never
been
allowed
to
forget
it
a
long
line
of
forefathers
in
their
gilded
frames
mutely
gazed
their
sense
of
the
obligations
they
had
bequeathed
to
this
last
representative
of
their
race
when
one
belongs
to
a
great
family
he
can
not
live
entirely
for
himself
his
disgrace
or
failure
reflects
not
alone
on
his
own
reputation
but
it
sullies
the
fair
fame
of
men
long
dead
and
buried
and
this
is
a
dreadful
thing
for
all
these
old
puritans
and
cavaliers
these
knights
and
barons
these
king
councillors
and
scholars
have
perchance
lived
out
the
long
years
of
their
lives
with
all
good
intent
and
purpose
and
with
all
earnestness
of
execution
merely
that
they
might
build
and
send
down
to
posterity
this
same
fair
fame
it
is
a
bold
man
or
a
wicked
man
who
will
dare
lightly
to
bring
the
efforts
of
so
many
lives
to
naught
in
the
thought
of
these
centuries
of
endeavour
the
sacrifice
of
mere
personal
happiness
does
not
seem
so
great
an
affair
after
all
the
family
name
has
taken
to
itself
a
soul
it
is
a
living
thing
it
may
be
worked
for
it
may
be
nourished
by
affection
it
may
even
be
worshipped
men
may
give
their
lives
to
it
with
as
great
a
devotion
with
as
exalted
a
sense
of
renunciation
and
as
lofty
a
joy
in
that
renunciation
as
those
who
vow
allegiance
to
francis
or
dominic
the
tearing
of
the
heart
from
the
bosom
often
proves
to
be
a
mortal
hurt
when
there
is
nothing
to
put
in
the
gap
of
its
emptiness
not
so
when
a
tradition
like
this
may
partly
take
its
place
these
and
more
subtle
considerations
were
the
noblest
elements
of
bennington
de
laney
doubts
but
perhaps
they
were
no
more
potent
than
some
others
which
rushed
through
the
breach
made
for
them
in
the
young
man
decision
he
had
always
lived
so
much
at
home
that
he
had
come
to
accept
the
home
point
of
view
without
question
that
is
to
say
he
never
examined
the
value
of
his
parent
ideas
because
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
doubt
them
he
had
no
perspective
in
a
way
then
he
accepted
as
axioms
the
social
tenets
held
by
his
mother
or
the
business
methods
practised
by
his
father
he
believed
that
elderly
men
should
speak
precisely
and
in
grammatical
but
colourless
english
he
believed
also
that
people
should
in
society
conduct
themselves
according
to
the
pattern
designed
by
de
laney
he
believed
these
things
not
because
he
was
a
fool
or
shallow
or
lacking
in
humour
or
snobbish
but
because
nothing
had
ever
happened
to
cause
him
to
examine
his
beliefs
closely
that
he
might
appreciate
what
they
really
were
one
of
these
views
was
that
cultured
people
were
of
a
class
in
themselves
and
could
not
and
should
not
mix
with
other
classes
de
laney
entertained
a
horror
of
vulgarity
so
was
this
horror
that
a
remote
taint
of
it
was
sufficient
to
thrust
forever
outside
the
pale
of
her
approbation
any
unfortunate
who
exhibited
it
she
preferred
stupidity
to
common
sense
when
the
former
was
allied
with
good
form
and
the
latter
only
with
plain
kindliness
this
was
partly
instinct
and
partly
the
result
of
cultivation
she
would
shrink
with
uncontrollable
disgust
from
any
of
the
lower
classes
with
whom
she
came
unavoidably
in
contact
a
slight
breach
of
the
conventions
earned
her
distrust
of
one
of
her
own
caste
as
this
personal
idiosyncrasy
fell
in
line
with
the
de
laney
pride
it
was
approved
by
the
head
of
the
family
under
encouragement
it
became
almost
a
monomania
bennington
pictured
to
himself
only
too
vividly
the
effect
of
the
lawtons
on
this
lady
aristocratic
prejudices
he
knew
only
too
well
that
bill
lawton
table
manners
would
not
be
allowed
even
in
her
kitchen
he
could
imagine
lawton
fatuous
conversation
in
the
de
laney
or
maude
eliza
the
experience
of
having
the
three
westerners
to
dinner
just
once
would
bennington
knew
drive
his
lady
mother
to
the
verge
of
nervous
prostration
he
remembered
his
father
one
and
only
experience
in
bringing
business
connections
home
to
lunch
his
imagination
failed
to
picture
the
effect
of
her
having
to
endure
them
as
actual
members
of
the
family
as
if
this
were
not
bad
enough
his
restless
fancy
carried
him
a
step
farther
he
perceived
the
agonies
of
shame
and
mortification
real
even
though
they
were
conventional
she
would
have
to
endure
in
the
face
of
society
that
the
de
laneys
social
leaders
rigid
in
respectability
should
be
forced
to
the
humiliation
of
acknowledging
a
misalliance
should
be
forced
to
the
added
humiliation
of
confessing
that
this
marriage
was
not
only
with
a
family
of
inferior
social
standing
but
with
one
actually
unlettered
and
vulgar
bennington
knew
only
too
well
the
temper
of
his
mother
and
of
society
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
expand
these
doubts
to
amplify
these
reasons
and
even
to
adduce
others
which
occurred
to
the
unhappy
young
man
as
he
climbed
the
hill
but
enough
has
been
said
surely
the
reader
no
matter
how
removed
in
sympathy
from
that
line
of
argument
must
be
able
now
at
least
to
sympathize
to
perceive
that
bennington
de
laney
had
some
reason
for
thought
some
excuse
for
the
tardiness
of
his
steps
as
they
carried
him
to
a
meeting
with
the
girl
he
loved
for
he
did
love
her
perhaps
the
more
tenderly
that
doubts
must
perforce
arise
all
these
considerations
affected
not
at
all
his
thought
of
her
but
now
for
the
first
time
bennington
de
laney
was
weighing
the
relative
claims
of
duty
and
happiness
his
happiness
depended
upon
his
love
that
his
duty
to
his
race
his
parents
his
caste
had
some
reality
in
fact
and
a
very
solid
reality
in
his
own
estimation
the
author
hopes
he
has
shown
if
not
several
pages
have
been
written
in
vain
the
conflict
in
his
mind
had
carried
him
to
the
rock
here
as
he
expected
he
found
mary
already
arrived
he
ascended
to
the
little
plateau
and
dropped
wearily
to
the
moss
his
face
had
gone
very
white
in
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
you
see
now
why
i
asked
you
to
come
she
said
without
preliminary
now
you
have
seen
them
and
there
is
nothing
more
to
conceal
i
know
i
know
he
replied
dully
i
am
trying
to
think
it
out
i
ca
see
it
yet
they
took
entirely
for
granted
that
each
knew
the
subject
of
the
other
thoughts
the
girl
seemed
much
the
more
of
the
two
we
may
as
well
understand
each
other
she
said
quietly
without
emotion
you
have
told
me
a
certain
thing
and
have
asked
me
for
a
certain
answer
i
could
not
give
it
to
you
before
without
deceiving
you
now
the
answer
depends
on
you
i
have
deceived
you
in
a
way
she
went
on
more
earnestly
but
i
did
not
mean
to
i
did
not
realize
the
difference
truly
i
did
until
i
saw
the
girl
on
the
train
then
i
knew
the
difference
between
her
and
me
and
between
her
and
mine
and
when
you
turned
away
i
saw
that
you
were
her
kind
and
i
saw
too
that
you
ought
to
know
everything
there
was
about
me
then
you
spoke
i
meant
what
i
said
too
he
interrupted
you
must
believe
that
mary
whatever
comes
i
was
sorry
you
did
she
went
on
as
though
she
had
not
heard
him
then
with
just
a
touch
of
impatience
tingeing
the
even
calm
of
her
voice
oh
why
will
men
insist
on
saying
those
things
she
cried
the
way
to
win
a
girl
is
not
thus
he
should
see
her
often
without
speaking
of
love
being
everything
to
her
until
at
last
she
finds
she
can
not
live
without
him
have
i
been
that
to
you
mary
has
it
come
to
that
with
me
he
asked
wistfully
heaven
help
me
i
am
afraid
it
has
she
cried
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
a
great
gladness
leaped
up
into
his
face
and
died
as
the
blaze
of
a
fire
leaps
up
and
expires
that
makes
it
easier
and
harder
he
said
it
is
bad
enough
as
it
is
i
do
know
how
i
can
make
you
understand
dear
i
understand
more
than
you
think
she
replied
becoming
calm
again
and
letting
her
hands
fall
into
her
lap
i
am
going
to
speak
quite
plainly
you
love
me
ben
ah
do
i
know
it
she
cried
with
a
sudden
burst
of
passion
i
have
seen
it
in
your
eyes
these
many
days
i
have
heard
it
in
your
voice
i
have
felt
it
welling
out
from
your
great
heart
it
has
been
sweet
to
me
so
sweet
you
can
not
know
no
man
ever
could
know
how
that
love
of
yours
has
filled
my
soul
and
my
heart
until
there
was
room
for
nothing
else
in
the
whole
wide
world
you
love
me
he
said
wonderingly
if
i
had
not
known
that
do
you
think
i
would
have
endured
a
hesitation
after
you
had
seen
the
objectionable
features
of
my
life
do
you
think
that
if
i
had
the
slightest
doubts
of
your
love
i
could
now
understand
you
hesitate
but
i
do
and
i
honour
you
for
it
you
love
me
he
repeated
yes
yes
ben
dear
i
love
you
i
love
you
as
i
never
thought
to
be
permitted
to
love
do
you
want
to
know
what
i
did
that
second
day
on
the
rock
the
day
you
first
showed
me
what
you
really
were
the
day
you
told
me
of
your
old
home
and
the
great
tree
it
was
all
so
peaceful
and
tender
and
comforting
so
sweet
and
pure
that
it
rested
me
i
felt
here
is
a
man
at
last
who
could
not
misunderstand
me
could
not
be
abrupt
and
harsh
and
cruel
i
said
to
myself
is
not
perfect
nor
does
he
expect
perfection
i
shut
my
eyes
and
then
something
choked
me
and
the
tears
came
i
cried
out
loud
to
be
what
i
was
to
give
again
what
i
have
not
o
god
give
me
back
my
heart
as
it
once
was
and
let
me
love
yes
ben
dear
i
said
and
then
i
was
not
happy
any
more
all
day
but
god
answered
that
prayer
ben
dear
and
we
do
love
one
another
now
and
that
is
why
we
can
look
at
things
together
and
see
what
is
best
for
us
both
you
love
me
he
exclaimed
for
the
third
time
and
now
dear
we
must
talk
plainly
and
calmly
you
have
seen
what
my
family
is
i
do
know
mary
that
i
can
make
you
understand
at
all
began
bennington
helplessly
i
ca
express
it
even
to
myself
our
people
are
so
different
my
training
has
been
so
different
all
this
sort
of
thing
means
so
much
to
us
and
so
little
to
you
i
know
exactly
she
interrupted
i
have
read
and
i
have
lived
east
i
can
appreciate
just
how
it
is
see
if
i
can
not
read
your
thoughts
my
family
is
uneducated
if
it
becomes
your
family
your
own
parents
will
be
more
than
grieved
and
your
friends
will
have
little
to
do
with
you
you
have
also
duties
toward
your
family
a
family
is
that
it
yes
that
it
answered
he
but
there
are
so
many
things
it
does
not
say
it
seems
to
me
it
has
come
to
be
a
horrible
dilemma
with
me
if
i
do
what
i
am
afraid
is
my
duty
to
my
family
and
my
people
i
will
be
unhappy
without
you
forever
and
if
i
follow
my
heart
then
it
seems
to
me
i
will
wrong
myself
and
will
be
unhappy
that
way
it
seems
a
choice
of
just
in
what
manner
i
will
be
miserable
he
ended
with
a
ghastly
laugh
and
which
is
the
most
worth
while
she
asked
in
a
still
voice
i
do
know
i
do
know
he
cried
miserably
i
must
think
he
looked
out
straight
ahead
of
him
for
some
time
whichever
way
i
decide
he
said
after
a
little
i
want
you
to
know
this
mary
i
love
you
and
i
always
will
love
you
and
the
fact
that
i
choose
my
duty
if
i
do
is
only
that
if
i
did
not
i
would
not
consider
myself
worthy
even
to
look
at
you
a
silence
fell
on
them
again
i
can
not
live
west
said
he
again
as
though
he
had
been
arguing
this
point
in
his
mind
and
had
just
reached
the
conclusion
of
it
my
life
is
east
i
never
knew
it
until
now
he
hesitated
would
you
that
is
could
you
i
mean
would
your
family
have
to
live
east
too
she
caught
his
meaning
and
drew
herself
up
with
a
little
pride
in
the
movement
wherever
i
go
whatever
i
do
my
people
must
be
free
to
go
or
do
you
have
your
duty
to
your
family
i
have
my
duty
to
mine
he
bowed
his
head
quietly
in
assent
she
looked
at
the
struggle
depicted
in
the
lines
of
his
face
with
eyes
in
which
strangely
enough
was
much
pity
but
no
unhappiness
or
doubt
could
it
be
that
she
was
so
sure
of
the
result
at
last
he
raised
his
head
slowly
and
turned
to
her
with
an
air
of
decision
mary
he
began
at
that
moment
there
became
audible
a
sudden
rattle
of
stones
below
the
rock
and
at
the
same
instant
a
harsh
voice
broke
in
rudely
upon
their
conversation
chapter
xviii
the
claim
jumpers
bennington
instinctively
put
his
finger
on
his
lips
to
enjoin
silence
and
peered
cautiously
over
the
edge
of
the
dike
perhaps
he
was
glad
that
this
diversion
had
occurred
to
postpone
even
for
a
short
time
the
announcement
of
a
decision
it
had
cost
him
so
much
to
make
perhaps
he
recognised
the
voice
three
men
were
clambering
a
trifle
laboriously
over
the
broken
rocks
at
the
foot
of
the
dike
swearing
a
little
at
their
unstable
footing
but
all
apparently
much
in
earnest
in
their
conversation
even
as
bennington
looked
they
came
to
a
halt
and
then
sank
down
each
on
a
convenient
rock
talking
interestedly
one
was
old
mizzou
one
was
the
man
arthur
the
third
was
a
stranger
whom
bennington
had
never
seen
the
latter
had
hardly
the
air
of
the
country
he
was
a
dapper
little
man
dressed
in
a
dark
gray
cutaway
and
a
brown
derby
hat
which
was
pushed
far
back
on
his
head
his
face
however
was
keen
and
alert
and
brown
all
of
which
characteristics
indicated
an
active
western
life
at
no
very
remote
day
the
words
which
had
so
powerfully
arrested
bennington
de
laney
attention
were
delivered
by
old
mizzou
to
this
stranger
thar
the
old
man
had
said
ai
that
crazy
hoss
lode
as
a
lead
as
they
make
so
so
so
so
replied
the
man
in
the
derby
in
a
high
voice
your
vein
is
a
fissure
vein
all
right
enough
and
you
got
a
good
wide
lead
if
it
holds
up
in
quality
i
do
know
but
what
you
right
i
shows
you
them
assays
of
mcpherson
do
i
argued
mizzou
any
quartz
in
this
kentry
that
assays
dollars
ai
no
ways
cheap
this
speech
was
so
significantly
in
line
with
bennington
surmise
that
he
caught
his
breath
and
drew
back
cautiously
out
of
sight
but
still
in
such
a
position
that
he
could
hear
plainly
every
word
uttered
by
the
group
below
the
girl
was
watching
him
with
bright
interested
eyes
listen
carefully
he
whispered
bringing
his
mouth
close
to
her
ear
i
think
there
some
sort
of
plot
here
she
nodded
ready
comprehension
and
they
settled
themselves
to
hear
the
following
conversation
i
saw
the
assay
replied
the
stranger
voice
to
mizzou
last
statement
but
who
this
mcpherson
how
do
i
know
the
assays
are
all
right
why
he
that
thar
professer
at
th
school
of
mines
expostulated
mizzou
oh
yes
cried
the
stranger
as
though
suddenly
enlightened
if
those
are
his
assays
they
all
right
let
see
them
again
there
followed
a
rustling
of
papers
well
i
looked
over
your
layout
went
on
the
stranger
after
a
moment
and
pretty
thoroughly
in
the
last
few
days
i
know
what
got
here
now
what
your
proposition
there
was
a
pause
i
knows
you
a
good
while
slayton
began
mizzou
but
was
interrupted
almost
immediately
by
a
third
voice
that
of
arthur
the
point
is
this
said
the
latter
sharply
davidson
here
is
in
a
position
to
give
you
possession
of
this
group
o
claims
but
he
in
a
position
to
appear
in
th
transaction
how
are
you
goin
to
purtect
him
an
me
so
we
gets
something
out
of
it
wait
a
minute
put
in
the
stranger
i
want
to
ask
a
few
questions
myself
these
claims
belong
to
the
holy
smoke
company
now
do
they
well
that
the
idea
are
either
of
you
the
agent
of
that
company
not
directly
perhaps
are
you
indirectly
seems
to
me
you
have
got
any
call
t
look
into
that
if
we
guarantee
t
give
you
good
title
how
do
i
know
you
can
give
me
good
title
ai
i
tellin
you
so
yes
but
why
should
i
believe
you
you
should
unless
you
got
sense
enough
to
see
that
we
gettin
you
up
here
an
we
ai
living
round
these
parts
a
couple
of
years
on
a
busted
proposition
the
stranger
evidently
debated
this
how
would
it
be
if
you
took
equal
shares
with
me
on
the
claims
your
shares
to
be
paid
from
the
earnings
that
would
be
fair
all
round
you
would
get
nothing
unless
the
title
was
good
i
would
risk
no
more
than
you
did
he
suggested
is
i
tellin
yo
i
do
appear
a
tall
in
this
yere
transaction
objected
mizzou
the
stranger
laughed
a
little
i
can
see
through
a
millstone
he
said
why
do
you
old
turtlebacks
come
out
of
your
shells
and
play
square
you
got
some
shady
game
on
here
that
you
working
underhand
spin
your
yarn
and
i
tell
you
what
i
think
of
it
how
do
i
know
you
do
leave
us
out
we
tells
you
objected
mizzou
returning
to
his
original
idea
you
do
answered
the
stranger
impatiently
you
do
but
it
seems
to
me
if
you
expect
to
get
anything
out
of
a
shady
transaction
you
got
to
risk
something
that
right
put
in
arthur
that
right
said
now
slayton
we
agree
to
git
you
full
legal
control
of
these
yere
claims
if
you
develop
them
at
your
expense
an
gin
davidson
and
me
a
third
interest
between
us
fer
our
influence
that
our
proposition
an
that
goes
if
you
do
play
squar
i
knows
how
t
make
ye
spin
your
yarn
repeated
the
stranger
quietly
i
agree
to
give
you
and
davidson
a
third
interest
i
take
hold
of
the
thing
at
all
an
jack
slayton
put
in
mizzou
threateningly
if
you
do
play
us
squar
i
swar
i
shoot
ye
like
a
dog
oh
stow
that
davidson
rejoined
the
stranger
in
an
irritated
voice
that
rot
do
do
any
good
i
know
you
and
you
know
me
i
never
went
back
on
a
game
yet
and
you
know
it
i
does
know
it
jack
came
up
davidson
voice
repentantly
but
this
is
a
big
deal
an
y
ca
be
too
careful
all
right
all
right
the
stranger
responded
now
tell
us
your
scheme
how
can
you
get
hold
of
the
property
by
jumping
the
claims
replied
arthur
calmly
there
ensued
a
short
pause
then
do
be
a
fool
exclaimed
slayton
with
contempt
this
is
no
country
you
ca
drive
a
man
off
his
property
with
a
gun
i
knows
that
these
claims
can
be
quiet
and
legal
how
they
ai
a
stroke
of
assessment
work
done
on
since
we
came
th
company
title
gone
long
ago
they
lost
their
job
last
january
them
claims
is
open
to
any
one
who
cares
to
have
the
stranger
uttered
a
long
whistle
old
mizzou
chuckled
cunningly
i
has
charge
of
them
claims
from
th
time
they
quits
work
on
now
they
ai
a
pick
raised
on
anybody
could
any
time
since
las
january
but
how
about
the
company
asked
slayton
how
did
you
fool
them
oh
i
sends
bills
fer
work
enough
and
i
did
throw
away
th
money
neither
yes
that
be
easy
enough
but
how
about
the
people
around
here
why
have
they
jumped
the
claims
long
ago
wall
i
argues
about
this
these
yere
gents
sees
i
has
charge
an
they
says
to
themselves
davidson
takes
care
of
them
assessment
works
all
right
an
so
they
never
thinks
it
worth
while
t
see
whether
it
is
done
or
not
you
trusted
to
their
thinking
you
were
performing
your
duties
thet
it
well
it
was
a
pretty
big
risk
t
gain
an
nothin
t
lose
quoted
old
mizzou
comfortably
how
about
this
new
man
the
company
has
out
here
de
laney
is
he
in
this
deal
too
oh
him
said
davidson
with
vast
contempt
he
don
know
enough
dodge
a
brick
i
tells
him
th
assessment
work
is
all
done
he
believes
it
an
never
looks
t
see
i
gets
him
fooled
so
easy
it
shore
funny
hold
on
put
in
slayton
sharply
i
not
so
sure
you
are
liable
there
somewhere
of
course
your
failure
to
do
the
assessment
work
while
you
were
alone
here
was
negligence
but
that
is
all
the
company
could
fire
you
for
failing
to
do
your
duty
but
they
could
prove
any
fraud
against
you
but
when
this
de
laney
came
along
it
changed
things
how
is
that
well
you
told
him
the
assessment
work
had
been
done
in
so
many
words
did
you
the
company
can
prove
that
you
were
using
your
official
information
to
deceive
him
for
the
purposes
of
fraud
in
other
words
you
were
an
officer
of
the
company
and
you
deceived
another
officer
in
your
official
capacity
i
do
know
but
you
be
liable
to
a
criminal
action
not
on
your
said
old
mizzou
with
confidence
have
you
looked
it
up
i
does
better
than
that
at
that
point
i
shore
becomes
subtle
resigns
from
th
company
that
i
talks
assessment
work
i
tells
him
advice
jest
as
a
friend
if
he
believes
th
same
an
it
ai
so
why
thet
but
they
ca
do
anythin
t
me
i
jest
an
outsider
he
is
responsible
to
th
company
an
if
he
wants
information
he
ought
to
go
to
th
books
and
not
to
frien
who
may
deceive
him
davidson
you
a
genius
exclaimed
the
stranger
heartily
i
tells
you
i
becomes
subtle
acknowledged
the
old
man
with
just
pride
but
now
you
sees
it
ai
delikit
that
my
name
appears
in
case
a
tall
folks
is
so
suspicious
these
yere
days
that
if
i
has
a
share
and
arthur
yere
has
a
share
they
says
we
has
this
yere
scheme
in
view
right
along
but
if
slayton
gets
them
lapsed
claims
by
hisself
slayton
bein
a
stranger
they
thinks
how
fortinit
that
slayton
is
t
git
onto
it
and
they
puts
pore
ole
mizzou
down
as
becomin
fergitful
in
his
old
age
the
stranger
laughed
it
easy
he
remarked
we
get
them
for
nothing
and
you
can
bet
your
sweet
life
i
push
through
for
all
there
is
in
it
why
boys
you
rich
you
wo

anything
more
to
do
the
rest
of
your
mortal
days
unless
you
want
to

ai
seekin

manual
employment
observed
mizzou

arthur

a
chance
now
we
better
hustle
this
thing
through
lively

make
our
discoveries
on
the
quiet
so
no
one
will
get
on
to
us
it
ai
goin
t
take
us
long
t
tack
up

evenin
jest
lay
low
all
ai
de
laney
going
to
get
onto
us
sasshaying
off
with
a
lot
of
notices

remarked
old
mizzou
grimly
i
knows
a
dark
hole
whar
we
retires
that
young
man
for
th
day
if
it
comes
t
that
though
you

the
stranger
laughed
unpleasantly
you
show
me
the
hole
and
i
take
care
of
man
he
agreed
he
laughed
again
by
the
way
it
strikes
me
that
fellow
going
to
run
up
against
a
good
deal
of
tribulation
before
he
gets
through
wall
thet
thar
ai
goin
to
raise
his
pay
when
they
finds
it
out
agreed
mizzou
thet
bishop
he
gets
tolerable
anxious
them
assessment
works
now
and
writes
frequent
i
got
a
whole
bunch
of
his
letters
up
t
camp
that
i
keeps
for
th
good
of
his
health
no
wise
healthy
t
worry
business
you
know
wonder
th
little
idiot
did
miss
his
mail
growled
arthur
oh
i
coaxes
him
on
with
th
letters
from
his
mammy
and
pappy
harmless
enough
the
three
men
fell
into
a
discussion
of
various
specimens
of
quartz
which
they
took
from
their
pockets
and
after
what
seemed
to
be
an
interminable
time
arose
and
moved
slowly
down
the
hill
the
girl
looked
at
her
companion
with
eyes
ben
she
gasped
what
have
you
done
made
a
fool
of
myself
he
responded
curtly
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
i
do
know
he
knit
his
brows
deeply
she
cast
about
for
an
expedient
i
wish
i
knew
more
about
mining
she
cried
i
know
there
is
some
way
to
get
legal
possession
of
a
claim
by
patenting
it
but
i
do
know
how
you
do
it
he
did
not
reply
there
must
be
some
way
out
of
this
she
went
on
all
alert
they
have
done
anything
yet
why
do
you
go
down
to
camp
and
inquire
every
man
would
be
in
the
hills
in
less
than
an
hour
i
could
trust
them
he
replied
brusquely
oh
i
know
she
cried
with
relief
you
must
hunt
up
jim
he
knows
all
about
those
things
and
you
could
rely
on
him
jim
what
jim
jim
fay
oh
that
just
it
run
ben
go
at
once
do
wait
a
minute
i
want
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
that
man
he
said
deliberately
he
has
insulted
me
at
every
opportunity
he
has
treated
me
in
a
manner
that
was
even
more
than
insulting
every
time
we
have
met
if
i
were
dying
and
he
had
but
to
turn
his
head
toward
me
to
save
me
i
would
not
ask
him
to
do
so
oh
do
be
foolish
ben
cried
she
wringing
her
hands
in
despair
do
let
your
pride
stand
in
your
way
do
you
not
realize
the
disgrace
this
will
be
to
you
to
lose
all
these
rich
claims
just
by
carelessness
do
you
realize
that
it
means
something
to
me
for
i
have
been
the
reason
of
that
carelessness
i
know
it
just
this
once
forget
all
he
has
done
to
you
you
can
trust
him
do
be
afraid
of
that
tell
him
that
i
sent
you
if
you
do
want
to
trust
him
on
your
own
account
she
broke
off
where
are
you
going
she
asked
anxiously
to
do
something
he
answered
shutting
his
teeth
together
with
a
snap
will
you
see
jim
she
begged
following
him
to
the
edge
of
the
rock
as
he
swung
himself
down
the
tree
no
he
said
without
looking
back
after
he
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
holy
smoke
camp
as
she
noticed
she
descended
rapidly
to
the
ground
and
hurried
sobbing
excitedly
away
toward
spanish
gulch
she
was
all
alive
with
distress
she
had
never
realized
until
the
moment
of
his
failure
how
much
she
had
loved
this
man
near
the
village
she
paused
bathed
her
eyes
in
the
brook
and
assuming
an
air
of
deliberation
and
calmness
began
making
inquiries
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
jim
fay
chapter

bennington
proves
game
bennington
de
laney
sat
on
the
pile
of
rocks
at
the
entrance
to
the
holy
smoke
shaft
across
his
knees
lay
the
rifle
his
face
was
very
white
and
set
perhaps
he
was
thinking
of
his
return
to
new
york
in
disgrace
of
his
interview
with
bishop
of
his
inevitable
meeting
with
a
multitude
of
friends
who
would
read
in
the
daily
papers
the
accounts
of
his
incompetence
criminal
incompetence
they
would
call
it
the
shadows
were
beginning
to
lengthen
across
the
slope
of
the
hill
up
the
gulch
cow
bells
tinkled
up
the
hill
birds
sang
and
through
the
little
hollows
twilight
flowed
like
a
vapour
the
wild
roses
on
the
hillside
were
blooming
late
in
this
high
altitude
the
pines
were
singing
their
endless
song
but
bennington
de
laney
was
looking
upon
none
of
these
softer
beauties
of
the
hills
rather
he
watched
intently
the
lower
gulch
with
its
skeleton
laid
bare
could
it
be
that
in
the
destruction
there
figured
forth
he
caught
the
symbol
of
his
own
condition
that
the
dreary
gloom
of
that
ruin
typified
the
chaos
of
sombre
thoughts
that
occupied
his
own
remorseful
mind
if
so
the
fancy
must
have
absorbed
him
the
moments
slipped
by
one
by
one
the
shadows
grew
longer
the
bird
songs
louder
and
still
the
figure
with
the
rifle
sat
motionless
his
face
white
and
still
watching
the
lower
gulch
or
could
it
be
that
bennington
de
laney
waited
for
some
one
and
that
therefore
his
gaze
was
so
fixed
it
would
seem
so
for
when
the
beat
of
hoofs
became
audible
the
white
face
quickened
into
alertness
and
the
motionless
figure
stirred
somewhat
the
rider
came
in
sight
rising
and
falling
in
a
steady
unhesitating
lope
he
swung
rapidly
to
the
left
and
ascended
the
knoll
opposite
the
shaft
of
the
holy
smoke
lode
he
reined
in
his
bronco
and
dismounted
the
rider
was
jim
fay
bennington
de
laney
did
not
move
he
looked
up
at
the
newcomer
with
dull
resignation
he
takes
it
hard
poor
fellow
thought
fay
well
what
to
be
done
asked
the
easterner
in
a
strained
voice
i
suppose
you
know
all
about
it
or
you
would
be
here
yes
i
know
all
about
it
said
fay
gently
you
must
take
it
so
hard
perhaps
we
can
do
something
we
be
able
to
save
one
or
two
claims
any
way
if
we
quick
about
it
i
heard
something
about
patenting
claims
went
on
de
laney
in
the
same
strange
dull
tones
could
that
be
done
no
you
have
to
do
five
hundred
dollars
worth
of
work
and
advertise
for
sixty
days
there
is
time
that
settles
it
i
do
know
what
we
can
do
then
well
that
depends
i
come
to
help
do
something
we
got
to
get
an
everlasting
hustle
on
us
that
all
and
i
afraid
we
are
beginning
a
little
behindhand
in
the
race
you
ought
to
have
hunted
me
up
at
once
i
do
see
what
there
is
to
do
repeated
bennington
thickly
do
you
the
assessment
work
has
been
done
that
the
idea
is
it
and
so
the
claims
have
reverted
to
the
government
they
are
therefore
open
to
location
as
in
the
beginning
and
that
is
just
what
davidson
and
that
crowd
are
going
to
do
to
them
well
they
just
as
much
open
to
us
we
just
our
own
claims
what
cried
the
easterner
excited
well
relocate
them
ourselves
if
that
suits
you
better
bennington
dull
eyes
began
to
light
up
so
get
a
move
on
you
went
on
fay
hustle
out
some
paper
so
we
can
make
location
notices
under
the
terms
of
a
relocation
we
can
use
the
old
stakes
and
so
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
tack
up
a
new
notice
all
round
that
the
trouble
that
gang
got
their
notices
all
written
and
i
afraid
they
got
ahead
of
us
come
on
bennington
who
had
up
to
this
time
remained
seated
on
the
pile
of
stones
seemed
filled
with
a
new
and
great
excitement
he
tottered
to
his
feet
throwing
his
hands
aloft
thank
god
thank
god
he
cried
catching
his
breath
convulsively
fay
turned
to
look
at
him
curiously
we
are
that
much
out
of
the
woods
he
remarked
the
other
gang
get
in
their
work
do
you
fret
they
never
will
they
never
will
cried
the
easterner
exultantly
they
ca
we
locate
all
the
tears
welled
over
his
eyes
and
ran
down
his
cheeks
what
do
you
mean
asked
fay
beginning
to
fear
the
excitement
had
unsettled
his
companion
wits
because
they
there
cried
bennington
pointing
to
the
mouth
of
the
shaft
near
which
he
had
been
sitting
davidson
slayton
arthur
they
all
there
and
they
ca
get
away
i
did
know
what
else
to
do
i
had
to
do
something
fay
cast
an
understanding
glance
at
the
young
man
rifle
and
sprang
to
the
entrance
of
the
shaft
as
though
in
direct
corroboration
of
his
speech
fay
could
perceive
just
emerging
from
the
shadow
the
sinister
figure
of
the
man
arthur
creeping
cautiously
up
the
ladder
evidently
encouraged
to
an
attempt
to
escape
by
the
sound
of
the
conversation
above
the
westerner
snatched
his
pistol
from
his
holster
and
presented
it
down
the
shaft
kindly
return
he
commanded
in
a
soft
voice
the
upward
motion
of
the
dim
figure
ceased
and
in
a
moment
it
had
faded
from
view
in
the
descent
fay
waited
a
moment
in
five
minutes
he
announced
in
louder
tones
i
going
to
let
loose
this
down
that
shaft
i
should
advise
you
gentlemen
to
retire
to
the
tunnel
he
peered
down
again
intently
a
sudden
clatter
and
thud
behind
him
startled
him
he
looked
around
bennington
had
fallen
at
full
length
across
the
stones
and
his
rifle
falling
had
clashed
against
the
broken
fay
with
a
slight
shrug
of
contempt
at
such
womanish
weakness
ran
to
his
assistance
he
straightened
the
easterner
out
and
placed
his
folded
coat
under
his
head
he
come
around
in
a
minute
he
muttered
he
glanced
toward
the
gulch
and
then
back
to
the
shaft
ca
leave
that
he
went
on
he
bent
over
the
prostrate
figure
and
began
to
loosen
the
band
of
his
shirt
something
about
the
boy
clothing
attracted
his
attention
so
drawing
his
knife
he
deftly
and
gently
ripped
away
the
coat
and
shirt
then
he
arose
softly
to
his
feet
and
bared
his
head
i
apologize
to
you
said
he
addressing
the
recumbent
form
you
are
game
in
the
fleshy
part
of
the
naked
shoulder
was
a
small
round
hole
clotted
and
smeared
with
blood
jim
fay
stooped
and
examined
the
wound
closely
the
bullet
had
entered
near
the
point
of
the
shoulder
but
a
little
below
so
that
it
had
merely
cut
a
secant
through
the
curve
of
the
muscle
if
it
had
struck
a
quarter
of
an
inch
to
the
left
it
would
have
gouged
a
furrow
a
quarter
of
an
inch
beyond
that
would
have
caused
it
to
miss
entirely
fay
saw
that
the
hurt
itself
was
slight
and
that
the
easterner
had
fainted
more
because
of
loss
of
blood
than
from
the
shock
this
determined
to
his
satisfaction
he
moved
quickly
to
the
mouth
of
the
shaft
way
below
he
cried
in
a
sharp
voice
and
discharged
his
revolver
twice
down
the
opening
then
he
stole
noiselessly
away
and
ran
at
speed
to
the
kitchen
of
the
shack
whence
he
immediately
returned
with
a
pail
of
water
and
a
number
of
towels
he
set
these
down
and
again
peered
down
the
shaft
way
below
he
repeated
and
dropped
down
a
sizable
chunk
of
ore
apparently
satisfied
that
the
prisoners
were
well
warned
he
gave
his
whole
attention
to
his
patient
he
washed
the
wound
carefully
then
he
made
a
compress
of
one
of
the
towels
and
bound
it
with
the
other
two
looking
up
he
discovered
bennington
watching
him
intently
it
all
right
he
assured
the
latter
in
answer
to
the
question
in
his
eyes
nothing
but
a
scratch
lie
still
a
minute
till
i
get
this
fastened
and
you
can
sit
up
and
watch
the
rat
hole
while
i
get
you
some
clothes
in
another
moment
or
so
the
young
man
was
propped
up
against
an
empty
ore
bucket
his
shoulder
bound
and
his
hand
slung
comfortably
in
a
sling
from
his
neck
there
you
are
said
jim
cheerily
now
you
take
my
and
watch
that
aggregation
till
i
get
back
they
wo
come
out
any
but
you
may
as
well
be
sure
he
handed
bennington
his
revolver
and
moved
off
in
the
direction
of
the
cabin
whistling
cheerfully
the
young
man
looked
after
him
thoughtfully
nothing
could
have
been
more
considerate
than
the
westerner
manner
nothing
could
have
been
kinder
than
his
prompt
action
bennington
saw
that
his
pony
now
cropping
the
brush
near
at
hand
was
black
with
sweat
nothing
could
have
been
more
straightforward
than
his
assistance
in
the
matter
of
the
claims
and
yet
bennington
de
laney
was
not
satisfied
he
felt
he
owed
the
sudden
change
of
front
to
a
word
spoken
in
his
behalf
by
the
girl
this
was
a
strange
influence
she
possessed
thus
to
alter
a
man
attitude
entirely
by
the
mere
voicing
of
a
wish
the
westerner
returned
carrying
a
loose
shirt
and
a
coat
which
he
drew
entire
over
the
injured
shoulder
which
left
one
sleeve
empty
i
guess
that
fixes
you
said
he
with
satisfaction
look
here
put
in
bennington
suddenly
you
been
mighty
good
to
me
in
all
this
if
you
had
come
along
as
you
did
these
fellows
would
have
nabbed
me
sooner
or
later
and
probably
i
have
lost
the
claims
any
way
i
feel
i
owe
you
a
lot
but
i
want
you
to
know
before
you
go
any
further
that
that
do
square
us
you
had
it
in
for
me
ever
since
i
came
out
here
and
you
made
it
mighty
unpleasant
for
me
i
ca
forget
that
all
at
once
i
want
to
tell
you
plainly
that
although
i
am
grateful
enough
i
know
just
why
you
have
done
all
this
it
is
because
asked
you
to
and
knowing
that
i
ca
accept
what
you
do
for
me
as
from
a
friend
for
i
do
feel
friendly
toward
you
in
the
least
his
face
flushed
painfully
i
not
trying
to
insult
you
or
be
boorish
he
said
i
just
want
you
to
understand
how
i
feel
about
it
and
now
that
you
know
i
suppose
you
better
let
the
matter
go
although
i
much
obliged
to
you
for
fixing
me
up
he
glanced
at
his
shoulder
fay
listened
to
this
speech
quietly
and
with
patience
what
do
you
intend
to
do
he
asked
when
the
other
had
quite
finished
i
do
know
yet
if
you
say
nothing
down
below
and
i
sure
you
will
not
i
contrive
some
way
of
keeping
this
procession
down
the
hole
and
of
feeding
them
and
then
i
relocate
the
claims
myself
with
one
arm
yes
with
one
arm
cried
bennington
fiercely
with
no
arms
at
all
if
need
be
he
broke
off
suddenly
with
the
new
yorker
ingrained
instinct
of
repression
i
beg
your
pardon
i
mean
i
do
as
well
as
i
can
of
course
how
about
the
woman
arthur
wife
she
give
you
trouble
she
has
locked
herself
in
her
cabin
already
i
will
assist
her
to
continue
the
imprisonment
fay
laughed
outright
and
you
expect
with
one
arm
and
wounded
to
feed
four
people
keep
them
in
confinement
and
at
the
same
time
to
relocate
eighteen
claims
lying
scattered
all
over
the
hills
well
you
optimistic
to
say
the
least
i
do
the
best
i
can
repeated
bennington
doggedly
and
you
wo
ask
help
of
a
friend
ready
to
give
it
not
as
a
friend
well
fay
chuckled
apparently
not
displeased
you
an
obstinate
young
man
or
rather
a
young
man
but
i
do
know
as
that
counts
against
you
i
help
you
out
anyway
if
not
as
a
friend
then
as
an
enemy
you
see
i
have
my
marching
orders
from
someone
else
and
you
have
anything
to
do
with
it
bennington
bowed
coldly
but
his
immense
relief
flickered
into
his
face
in
spite
of
himself
what
should
we
do
first
he
asked
formally
sit
here
and
wait
for
the
kids
responded
jim
who
are
the
kids
friends
of
mine
trustworthy
jim
rearranged
bennington
coverings
and
lit
a
pipe
tell
us
about
it
said
he
there
is
much
to
tell
i
knew
i
had
to
do
something
so
i
just
held
them
up
and
made
them
get
down
the
shaft
i
did
know
what
i
was
going
to
do
next
but
i
was
glad
to
have
them
out
of
the
way
to
get
time
to
think
who
plugged
you
inquired
fay
motioning
with
the
mouthpiece
of
his
pipe
toward
the
wounded
shoulder
that
was
arthur
he
had
a
little
gun
in
his
coat
pocket
and
he
shot
from
inside
the
pocket
i
made
them
drop
all
the
guns
they
had
i
thought
did
you
take
a
crack
at
him
then
asked
fay
interested
oh
no
i
just
covered
him
and
made
him
shell
out
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
believe
any
one
of
them
knew
i
was
hit
fay
smoked
on
in
silence
glancing
from
time
to
time
with
satisfaction
at
the
youth
opposite
during
the
passage
of
these
events
the
day
had
not
far
advanced
the
shadow
of
harney
had
not
yet
reached
out
to
the
edge
of
the
hills
hullo
the
kids
said
fay
suddenly
two
pedestrians
emerged
from
the
lower
gulch
and
bent
their
steps
toward
the
camp
as
they
came
nearer
bennington
with
a
gasp
of
surprise
recognised
the
leslies
the
sprightly
youths
were
dressed
just
alike
in
knickerbockers
and
norfolk
jackets
of
dark
brown
plaid
and
small
college
caps
to
match
an
outfit
which
bennington
had
always
believed
would
attract
too
vivid
attention
in
this
country
as
they
came
nearer
he
saw
that
the
jackets
were
fitted
with
pockets
of
great
size
in
the
pockets
were
sketch
books
and
bulging
articles
they
caught
sight
of
the
two
figures
on
the
ore
heap
simultaneously
behold
our
attentive
host
cried
jeems
he
is
now
in
the
act
of
receiving
us
with
all
honour
bennington
face
fairly
shone
with
pleasure
at
the
encounter
hullo
fellows
hullo
there
he
cried
out
delightedly
again
and
again
and
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
this
disclosed
the
fact
of
his
injury
and
the
brothers
ran
forward
with
real
sympathy
and
concern
expressed
on
their
lively
countenances
there
ensued
a
rapid
fire
of
questions
and

the
leslies
proved
to
be
already
familiar
with
the
details
of
the
attempt
to
jump
the
claims
and
understood
at
once
fay
brief
account
of
the
present
situation
over
which
they
rejoiced
in
the
leslie
fashion
they
exploded
in
genuine
admiration
of
bennington
adventure
and
praised
that
young
man
enthusiastically
bennington
could
feel
even
before
this
that
he
stood
on
a
different
footing
than
formerly
with
these
young
men
they
treated
him
as
familiarly
as
ever
but
with
a
new
respect
the
truth
is
their
astuteness
in
reading
character
which
is
as
essentially
an
attribute
of
the
artistic
temperament
in
black
and
white
as
in
words
and
phrases
had
shown
them
already
that
their
old
acquaintance
had
grown
from
boy
to
man
since
last
they
had
met
they
knew
this
even
before
they
learned
of
its
manifestation
so
astounding
was
the
change
that
they
gave
it
credit
perhaps
for
being
more
thorough
than
it
was
after
the
situation
had
been
made
plain
bennington
reverted
to
the
unexpectedness
of
their
appearance
but
you
have
told
me
yet
how
you
happen
to
be
here
he
suggested
i
as
soon
have
expected
to
see
ethel
henry
coming
up
the
gulch
did
you
get
our
letters
cried
bert
in
astonishment
no
i
have
received
any
letters
did
you
write
did
we
write
well
i
should
think
so
we
wrote
three
times
telling
you
we
were
coming
and
when
to
expect
us
jeems
and
i
wondered
why
you
did
meet
us
that
explains
it
seems
funny
you
did
get
any
of
those
letters
no
i
do
believe
it
is
so
funny
after
all
responded
bennington
who
had
been
thinking
it
over
i
remember
now
that
davidson
told
the
others
he
had
been
intercepting
my
letters
from
the
company
and
i
suppose
he
got
yours
too
that
it
of
course
i
have
to
interview
that
davidson
later
well
we
used
to
train
around
here
off
and
on
as
i
told
you
once
and
this
year
jeems
and
i
thought
we
do
our
summer
sketching
here
and
sort
of
revive
old
times
so
we
packed
up
and
came
i
mighty
glad
you
came
anyway
replied
bennington
fervently
so
i
we
just
in
time
to
help
foil
the
villain
as
foilers
jeems
and
i
are
an
artistic
success
we
have
studied
foiling
under
the
best
masters
in
the
bowery
and
sixth
avenue
theatres
where
bill
asked
jim
suddenly
will
be
around
in
the
morning
you
to
report
progress
at
once
did
dare
to
come
up
until
after
the
row
dreadful
anxious
though
would
have
come
if
jeems
and
i
had
forbidden
it
bennington
wondered
vaguely
who
bill
might
be
but
he
was
beginning
to
feel
a
little
tired
from
the
excitement
and
his
wound
so
he
said
nothing
the
next
thing
is
grub
remarked
fay
rising
and
gathering
his
reins
i
mosey
up
to
the
shack
and
see
about
supper
you
fellows
can
sit
around
and
talk
until
i
get
organized
he
turned
to
move
away
leading
his
horse
hold
on
a
minute
jim
called
bert
you
might
lend
me
your
bronc
and
i
lope
down
and
set
bill
mind
easy
it
wo
take
long
good
scheme
approved
jim
heartily
that
thoughtful
of
you
bertie
he
dropped
the
reins
where
he
stood
and
the
pony
with
the
usual
western
docility
hung
his
head
and
halted
bert
arose
and
looked
down
the
shaft
supper
will
be
served
shortly
gentlemen
he
observed
suavely
he
turned
toward
the
pony
bert
called
bennington
in
a
different
voice
did
you
say
you
were
going
down
the
gulch
yes
do
you
want
to
do
something
for
me
why
surely
what
is
it
would
you
just
as
soon
stop
at
the
lawtons
and
tell
miss
lawton
for
me
that
it
all
right
you
find
the
lawton
house
yes
i
know
where
the
lawton
house
is
interrupted
bert
but
miss
lawton
you
said
do
you
remember
bert
put
in
james
there
is
a
kid
there
maude
or
something
of
that
sort
no
no
not
maude
persisted
bennington
still
more
bashfully
i
mean
miss
lawton
the
young
lady
he
felt
that
both
the
youths
were
looking
keenly
at
him
with
dawning
wonder
and
delight
hold
on
bert
interposed
james
as
the
other
was
about
to
exclaim
do
you
mean
ben
the
one
you
been
giving
such
a
rush
for
the
last
two
months
miss
lawton
and
i
are
very
good
friends
replied
bennington
with
dignity
wondering
whence
james
had
his
information
bert
drew
in
his
breath
sharply
and
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
hold
on
bert
interposed
james
again
there
are
possibilities
in
this
do
destroy
artistic
development
by
undue
haste
what
did
you
call
the
young
lady
ben
miss
lawton
of
course
daughter
of
bill
lawton
why
yes
oh
my
eye
ejaculated
james
and
you
have
eyes
in
your
head
he
cried
after
a
moment
you
have
ears
in
your
head
blamed
if
you
have
everything
in
your
head
but
brains
she
a
good
one
i
did
appreciate
the
subtlety
of
that
woman
before
ben
you
everlasting
idiot
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
seen
that
girl
every
day
for
the
last
two
months
and
do
know
yet
that
she
too
good
to
belong
to
bill
lawton
bert
began
to
laugh
hysterically
what
do
you
mean
cried
bennington
what
i
say
is
bill
lawton
daughter
her
name
is
lawton
at
all
o
glory
he
do
even
know
her
name
james
in
his
turn
went
into
a
fit
of
laughing
in
uncontrollable
excitement
bennington
seized
him
with
his
sound
hand
what
is
it
tell
me
what
is
her
name
then
o
lord
do
squeeze
so
i
tell
you
letup
james
dashed
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
eyes
what
is
her
name
repeated
bennington
fiercely
wilhelmina
fay
we
call
her
bill
for
short
and
jim
fay
is
her
brother
and
the
lawtons
they
board
there
across
bennington
mind
flashed
vaguely
a
suspicion
that
turned
him
faint
with
mortification
who
is
this
jim
fay
he
asked
he
jim
fay
james
leicester
fay
of
boston
not
yes
exactly
the
boston
fays
bert
swung
himself
into
the
saddle
better
not
say
anything
to
bill
about
the
young
shoulder
called
after
him
the
james
chapter
xx
masks
off
now
that
it
was
all
explained
it
seemed
to
bennington
de
laney
to
be
ridiculously
simple
he
wondered
how
he
could
have
been
so
blind
for
the
moment
however
all
other
emotions
were
swallowed
up
in
intense
mortification
over
the
density
he
had
displayed
and
the
ridiculous
light
in
which
he
must
have
appeared
to
all
the
actors
in
the
comedy
his
companion
perceived
this
and
kindly
hastened
to
relieve
it
you
wondering
how
it
all
happened
said
he
but
you
do
want
to
ask
about
it
i
going
to
tell
you
the
story
of
your
life
you
see
bert
and
i
knew
the
fays
very
well
in
boston
and
we
knew
also
that
they
were
out
here
in
the
hills
that
what
tickled
us
so
when
you
said
you
were
coming
out
to
this
very
place
you
know
yourself
ben
that
you
were
pretty
green
when
you
were
in
new
york
you
must
know
it
because
you
have
got
over
it
so
nicely
since
and
it
struck
us
after
you
talked
so
much
about
the
west
that
it
would
be
a
shame
if
you
did
get
some
of
it
so
we
wrote
jim
that
you
were
coming
and
to
see
to
it
that
you
had
a
time
jim
chuckled
a
little
from
his
letters
i
guess
you
had
it
he
wrote
about
that
horse
he
sprung
on
you
and
the
time
they
lynched
you
and
all
the
rest
of
it
and
we
thought
we
had
done
pretty
well
especially
since
jim
wrote
he
thought
you
were
half
bad
and
had
come
through
in
good
shape
he
wrote
too
that
you
had
run
against
bill
and
that
bill
was
fooling
you
up
in
some
way
way
unspecified
he
seemed
to
be
a
little
afraid
that
bill
was
trifling
with
your
young
affections
how
is
it
ben
anyway
but
he
said
that
bill
was
very
haughty
on
the
subject
and
as
he
never
been
able
to
do
anything
with
her
before
he
believe
he
have
much
success
if
he
should
try
now
i
suggested
that
bill
might
get
in
a
little
deep
herself
went
on
james
watching
his
listener
face
keenly
but
bert
seemed
inclined
to
the
opinion
that
any
one
as
experienced
as
bill
was
perfectly
able
to
take
care
of
herself
anywhere
she
a
mighty
fine
girl
ben
old
man
suddenly
concluded
this
startling
youth
holding
out
his
hand
and
i
wish
you
every
success
in
the
world
in
getting
her
thank
you
jeems
replied
bennington
simply
without
attempting
to
deny
the
state
of
affairs
i
sure
i
glad
of
your
good
wishes
but
i
afraid
i
have
any
show
now
he
sighed
deeply
i
give
an
opinion
on
that
after
i
see
bill
again
observed
the
artist
sagely
it
always
struck
me
as
being
queer
that
two
of
the
most
refined
people
about
here
should
happen
to
be
living
in
the
same
house
commented
bennington
only
just
aware
that
it
had
so
struck
him
did
it
indeed
said
leslie
drolly
you
just
bursting
with
sagacity
now
are
you
and
your
intellect
is
seething
with
conjecture
the
lover
soul
is
far
above
the
sordid
earthly
considerations
which
interest
us
ordinary
mortals
but
i
bet
a
hat
you
are
wondering
how
it
comes
that
a
boston
girl
is
out
here
without
any
more
restraint
on
her
actions
than
a
careless
brother
who
does
bother
himself
and
why
she
out
here
at
all
and
a
few
things
like
that
up
well
acknowledged
bennington
a
trifle
reluctantly
of
course
it
is
a
little
out
of
the
ordinary
but
then
it
all
right
somehow
swear
all
right
of
course
it
all
right
they
have
any
father
or
mother
you
know
and
they
are
independent
of
action
as
you
no
doubt
noticed
bill
kept
house
for
jim
for
some
time
and
they
used
to
keep
a
great
house
i
tell
you
said
james
smacking
his
lips
in
recollection
bert
and
i
used
to
visit
there
a
good
deal
that
why
they
call
me
jeems
to
distinguish
me
from
jim
then
jim
got
tired
of
doing
nothing
they
possess
everlasting
rocks
you
know
their
lamented
dad
was
a
sort
of
amateur
croesus
and
he
decided
to
monkey
with
mines
bert
and
i
were
here
one
summer
so
bill
and
jim
just
pulled
up
stakes
and
came
along
too
they
have
been
here
ever
since
they
both
true
sports
and
like
the
life
and
all
that
and
besides
jim
has
kept
busy
monkeying
with
mining
speculation
they
the
salt
of
the
earth
that
pair
if
they
worry
poor
old
boston
to
death
with
their
ways
of
doing
things
that
one
reason
i
like
so
much
society
has
fits
over
their
doings
but
it
ca
get
along
without
them
the
fays
are
a
pretty
good
family
are
they
inquired
bennington
he
was
irresistibly
impelled
to
ask
this
question
best
going
mayflower
william
the
conqueror
and
all
that
rot
you
must
know
of
the
boston
fays
i
do
that
is
i
heard
of
them
but
i
did
know
whether
they
were
the
same
jeems
perceived
that
the
topic
interested
the
young
fellow
so
he
descanted
at
length
concerning
the
fays
their
belongings
and
their
doings
time
passed
rapidly
bennington
was
surprised
to
see
jim
coming
down
to
them
through
the
afterglow
of
sunset
announcing
vociferously
that
the
meal
was
at
last
prepared
i
fed
the
old
lady
he
announced
and
unlocked
her
she
know
what
up
anyway
she
just
sits
there
like
a
graven
image
scared
to
death
she
does
know
a
relocation
from
a
telegraph
pole
i
told
her
to
get
a
move
on
her
and
fix
us
up
some
bunks
and
i
guess
at
it
now
they
consulted
as
to
the
best
means
of
guarding
the
prisoners
it
was
finally
agreed
that
leslie
should
stand
sentinel
until
the
others
had
finished
supper
i
want
to
watch
the
effect
of
this
light
on
the
hills
he
announced
positively
and
i
not
hungry
and
jim
ought
to
cool
off
before
coming
out
into
the
air
and
ben
shoulder
ought
to
be
taken
care
of
get
along
with
ye
bennington
accompanied
jim
to
the
meal
very
cheerfully
the
facts
as
to
the
latter
persecutions
remained
the
same
but
in
some
way
they
did
not
hold
the
same
proportions
as
heretofore
the
mere
item
that
jim
fay
was
mary
brother
instead
of
her
lover
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
he
chattered
in
a
lively
fashion
concerning
the
method
of
work
to
be
adopted
suddenly
he
pulled
himself
up
short
i
think
i
must
beg
your
pardon
he
said
i
heard
about
it
all
from
jim
leslie
i
have
been
very
green
and
you
were
quite
right
if
you
still
want
to
do
so
let
go
into
this
together
as
friends
no
pardon
coming
to
me
responded
fay
heartily
i
been
a
little
tough
on
you
occasionally
that
i
admit
and
if
i
done
too
much
i
sure
i
beg
pardon
i
saw
you
had
the
right
stuff
in
you
that
day
when
you
stuck
to
the
horse
until
you
rode
him
and
i
always
liked
you
since
then
and
i
would
worry
about
this
last
matter
you
were
green
to
the
country
and
were
put
down
here
without
definite
instructions
you
trusted
davidson
of
course
and
got
fooled
in
it
but
then
you
just
followed
bishop
lead
in
that
he
been
trusting
davidson
before
you
got
here
and
if
he
had
trusted
him
right
along
you
can
bet
you
have
had
your
directions
from
a
to
z
he
was
as
much
to
blame
as
you
were
and
you
find
that
he
knows
it
i
afraid
you
ca
make
me
feel
any
better
about
that
objected
bennington
shaking
his
head
despondently
well
you
feel
better
after
a
time
and
anyway
there
no
actual
harm
done
at
this
moment
bert
leslie
entered
bill
tickled
to
death
he
announced
she
says
she
coming
up
first
thing
in
the
morning
she
wanted
to
come
right
off
and
cook
supper
but
i
would
let
her
she
could
very
well
stay
here
all
night
and
it
pretty
late
now
what
you
got
here
pork
coffee
murphies
he
sat
down
and
began
to
eat
hungrily
jim
arose
to
relieve
the
sentinel
at
the
mouth
of
the
shaft
at
the
same
time
advising
de
laney
to
go
to
bed
as
soon
as
possible
you
tired
he
said
and
need
rest
wet
that
compress
well
with
pond
extract
and
we
dress
it
again
in
the
morning
in
the
kitchen
he
found
the
strange
sombre
woman
sitting
bolt
upright
in
silence
her
arms
folded
rigidly
across
her
flat
bosom
she
looked
straight
in
front
of
her
and
rocked
slowly
to
and
fro
on
her
chair
you
must
worry
arthur
consoled
fay
kindly
pausing
for
a
moment
there
is
going
to
be
any
trouble
it
just
a
little
matter
of
mining
law
we
have
to
keep
your
husband
locked
up
for
a
few
days
but
he
wo
be
harmed
the
woman
made
no
reply
fay
looked
at
her
sharply
again
and
passed
out
jeems
he
directed
that
individual
at
the
mouth
of
the
shaft
go
get
your
grub
send
the
kid
to
bed
right
off
and
then
you
and
bert
come
down
here
and
we
fix
up
these
prairie
dogs
of
ours
down
the
hole
jeems
and
his
brother
therefore
helped
the
wounded
hero
to
bed
and
left
him
to
a
slumber
after
which
they
returned
to
the
spot
of
light
in
the
darkness
which
marked
the
glow
of
fay
pipe
that
capable
individual
issued
directions
first
of
all
they
lowered
by
means
of
a
light
cord
food
and
water
to
their
prisoners
the
latter
maintained
a
sullen
silence
and
it
was
only
by
the
lightening
of
the
burden
at
the
end
of
the
line
that
those
above
knew
their
provisions
had
been
appropriated
then
followed
blankets
the
leslies
were
strongly
in
favour
of
as
uncomfortable
a
confinement
as
possible
and
so
disapproved
of
blankets
but
fay
insisted
after
that
the
brothers
manned
the
windlass
and
let
jim
down
in
a
bowline
about
twenty
feet
while
he
detached
and
removed
two
lengths
of
the
shaft
ladder
this
left
no
means
of
ascent
as
the
walls
of
the
shaft
were
smoothly
timbered
but
to
make
matters
sure
they
covered
the
mouth
with
inch
thick
boards
on
which
they
piled
large
chunks
of
you
do
suppose
they
smother
suggested
bert
not
much
there
only
three
of
them
and
often
men
drilling
will
stay
down
ten
or
twelve
hours
at
a
time
without
using
up
the
air
sweet
dreams
gentlemen
called
the
irrepressible
jeems
in
farewell
there
one
other
thing
said
jim
and
then
we
can
crawl
in
he
approached
the
cabin
in
which
arthur
and
his
wife
were
accustomed
to
sleep
and
listened
until
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
arthur
was
inside
then
he
softly
locked
the
door
the
key
of
which
he
had
appropriated
immediately
after
supper
and
propped
shut
the
heavy
wooden
shutter
of
the
window
no
dramatic
escapes
in
ours
thank
you
he
muttered
he
drew
back
and
surveyed
his
work
with
satisfaction
come

turn
in
we

chapter
xxi
the
land
of
visions
although
he
had
retired
so
early
and
in
so
exhausted
a
condition
bennington
de
laney
could
not
sleep
he
had
taken
a
slight
fever
and
the
wound
in
his
shoulder
was
stiff
and
painful
for
hours
on
end
he
lay
flat
on
his
back
staring
at
the
dim
illuminations
of
the
windows
and
listening
to
the
faint
noises
or
the
sharper
borings
of
insects
in
the
logs
of
the
structure
his
mind
was
not
active
he
lay
in
a
whose
most
vivid
consciousness
was
that
of
mental
discomfort
and
the
interminability
of
time
the
events
of
the
day
rose
up
before
him
but
he
seemed
to
loathe
them
merely
because
they
had
been
of
so
active
a
character
and
now
he
could
not
bear
to
have
his
brain
teased
even
with
their
impalpable
shadow
strangely
enough
this
altitude
seemed
to
create
a
certain
dead
polarity
between
him
and
them
they
lay
sullenly
outside
his
brain
repelled
by
this
dead
polarity
and
he
looked
at
them
languidly
against
the
dim
illumination
of
the
window
with
a
dull
joy
that
they
could
not
come
near
him
and
enter
the
realm
of
his
thoughts
all
this
was
the
fever
in
a
little
time
these
events
became
endowed
with
more
palpable
bodies
which
moved
the
square
of
semilucent
window
faded
into
something
indescribable
and
that
into
something
indescribable
and
that
into
something
else
still
indescribable
they
moved
swiftly
and
things
happened
he
found
himself
suddenly
in
a
long
gallery
half
in
the
dusk
half
in
the
lamplight
pacing
slowly
back
and
forth
waiting
for
something
he
knew
not
what
to
him
came
a
bustling
motherly
old
woman
with
a
maid
cap
on
who
said
sure
master
ben
the
moon
is
shining
and
let
me
tell
ye
at
the
end
of
the
hall
is
a
balcony
of
iron
and
miss
mary
will
be
glad
you
know
that
same
and
at
that
he
seemed
to
himself
to
be
hunting
for
a
coin
with
which
to
tip
her
he
discovered
it
turned
to
lead
between
his
fingers
whereupon
the
old
woman
laughed
shrilly
and
disappeared
and
he
found
himself
alone
on
the
prairie
at
midnight
his
mind
seemed
to
be
filled
with
great
thoughts
which
would
make
him
famous
over
and
over
again
he
said
to
himself
the
rain
pours
and
the
people
down
below
chuckle
as
they
move
about
each
under
his
little
umbrella
of
they
look
up
to
the
mountain
saying
fool
why
looks
he
so
high
he
is
lost
in
the
mists
up
there
and
he
might
be
safe
and
dry
with
us
but
the
mountain
has
over
him
the
arch
of
the
universe
and
sleeps
calmly
in
the
sun
of
truth
little
recks
he
of
the
clouds
below
and
knows
not
at
all
the
little
fools
who
pity
him
and
he
thought
this
was
the
sum
of
all
wisdom
and
that
with
it
would
come
immortality
then
a
bell
began
to
boom
a
bell
whose
tolling
was
inexpressibly
solemn
and
poured
into
his
heart
a
sadness
too
deep
for
sorrow
as
though
there
dwelt
an
enchantment
in
the
very
sound
itself
the
dark
prairies
shifted
like
a
scene
and
in
their
stead
he
saw
in
a
cold
gray
twilight
a
high
doorway
built
of
a
cold
gray
stone
and
heavy
through
its
arch
passed
then
a
file
of
monks
their
faces
concealed
each
carried
a
torch
whose
flickering
wavering
light
cast
weird
cowled
figures
on
the
gray
stone
and
in
their
midst
was
borne
a
bier
covered
with
white
and
as
the
deep
bell
boomed
on
through
all
the
vision
like
a
subtle
thrilling
presence
bennington
seemed
to
himself
to
stand
finger
on
lip
the
eternal
custodian
of
the
secret
of
it
all
the
secret
that
each
of
these
cowled
figures
was
a
man
a
divine
soul
and
a
body
with
ears
and
eyes
and
a
brain
that
he
had
thoughts
and
his
life
that
is
and
is
to
come
was
of
these
thoughts
that
there
beat
hearts
beneath
that
gray
and
that
their
voices
must
not
be
heeded
that
in
the
morning
these
wearied
eyes
awaited
but
the
eve
and
that
the
evening
brought
no
hope
for
a
new
day
that
these
silent
awesome
beings
lived
within
the
heavy
stones
alone
with
monotony
until
the
bell
tolled
as
now
and
they
were
carried
through
the
arched
doorway
into
the
night
and
above
all
that
to
each
there
were
sixty
minutes
in
the
hour
and
hours
in
the
day
and
years
and
years
of
these
days
this
was
the
secret
and
he
was
its
custodian
none
of
the
others
knew
of
it
but
its
awfulness
made
him
sad
and
stern
he
checked
the
days
he
numbered
the
hours
he
counted
the
minutes
rigorously
lest
one
escape
one
did
escape
and
he
turned
back
to
catch
it
and
pursued
it
far
away
from
the
stone
doorway
and
the
dull
twilight
and
even
the
sound
of
the
bell
off
into
a
land
where
there
were
many
hills
and
valleys
among
which
the
fugitive
minute
hid
elusively
and
he
pursued
the
minute
calling
upon
it
to
come
to
him
and
the
name
by
which
he
called
it
was
mary
then
he
saw
that
the
square
of
the
window
had
become
yellow
with
the
sun
and
that
through
it
he
could
hear
plainly
the
voices
of
the
leslies
talking
in
high
tones
his
brain
was
very
clear
more
so
than
usual
and
he
not
only
received
many
impressions
and
ordered
them
with
ease
and
despatch
but
his
very
senses
seemed
more
than
ordinarily
acute
he
could
distinguish
even
by
day
when
the
night
stillness
had
withdrawn
its
favouring
conditions
the
borings
of
the
sawdust
insects
in
the
logs
of
the
cabin
only
he
was
very
tired
his
hands
seemed
a
long
distance
away
as
though
it
would
require
an
extraordinary
effort
of
the
will
to
lift
them
so
he
lay
quiet
and
listened
the
conversation
of
which
he
was
the
eavesdropper
was
carried
on
by
fits
and
starts
first
a
sentence
would
be
delivered
by
one
of
the
leslies
then
would
ensue
a
pause
as
though
for
a
reply
inaudible
to
any
but
the
interlocutors
themselves
then
another
sentence
and
so
on
like
a
man
at
a
telephone
after
a
moment
puzzling
over
it
bennington
understood
that
jim
leslie
was
talking
to
one
of
the
prisoners
down
the
shaft
you
have
the
true
sporting
spirit
sir
cried
the
voice
of
jeems
i
honour
you
for
it
but
so
philosophical
a
resignation
while
it
inclines
our
souls
to
know
more
of
you
personally
nevertheless
renders
you
much
less
interesting
in
such
a
juncture
as
the
present
i
would
like
to
hear
from
mr
davidson
pause
that
was
a
performance
davidson
which
i
can
not
entirely
commend
it
is
fluent
to
be
sure
but
it
lacks
variety
a
true
artist
would
have
interspersed
those
finer
shades
and
gradations
of
meaning
which
go
to
express
the
numerous
and
clashing
emotions
which
must
necessarily
agitate
your
venerable
bosom
you
surely
mean
more
than
is
expressive
and
forceful
because
capable
of
being
enunciated
at
one
explosive
effort
of
the
breath
but
it
is
monotonous
when
too
freely
employed
to
be
sure
you
might
with
some
justice
reply
that
you
had
qualified
said
adjective
strongly
but
the
qualification
was
trite
though
blasphemous
and
you
limited
it
very
nicely
but
the
limitation
to
myself
is
unjust
as
it
overlooks
my
brother
equitable
claims
to
notice
pause
i
pardon
kindly
repeat
pause
delicious
davidson
you
have
redeemed
yourself
bertie
did
you
hear
davidson
last
remark
no
replied
another
voice
could
be
bothered
what
was
it
davidson
with
a
polished
sarcasm
that
amounted
to
genius
advised
me
in
his
picturesque
vernacular
set
thet
jaw
of
mine
goin
and
then
go
away
an
leave
it
pause
i
beg
you
slayton
do
not
think
of
such
a
thing
i
would
not
have
him
repressed
for
anything
in
the
world
as
you
value
our
future
acquaintanceship
do
not
end
our
interview
thank
you
i
appreciate
your
compliment
and
in
return
will
repeat
that
though
in
a
pretty
sharp
game
you
are
a
true
sport
our
friend
arthur
is
strangely
silent
i
have
never
met
arthur
i
have
heard
that
either
his
face
or
his
hat
looks
like
a
fried
egg
but
i
forget
for
the
moment
which
was
so
characterized
pause
fie
fie
arthur
addison
in
his
most
intoxicated
moments
would
never
have
used
such
language
and
then
the
man
in
the
cabin
lying
on
the
bed
began
to
laugh
in
a
low
tone
his
laugh
was
not
pleasant
to
hear
he
was
realizing
how
funny
things
were
to
other
people
things
that
had
not
been
funny
to
him
at
all
for
the
first
time
he
caught
a
focus
on
his
father
with
his
pompous
pride
and
his
stilted
diction
on
his
mother
social
creed
he
cared
as
much
for
them
as
ever
and
his
respect
was
as
great
but
now
he
realized
that
outsiders
could
never
understand
them
as
he
did
and
that
always
to
others
they
must
appear
ridiculous
so
he
laughed
and
too
he
perceived
that
the
world
would
see
something
grimly
humorous
in
his
insistence
on
the
girl
parentage
when
all
the
time
in
the
home
to
which
he
was
to
bring
her
dwelt
these
unlovable
snobbish
old
parents
of
his
own
so
he
laughed
and
he
thought
of
how
he
had
been
fooled
and
played
with
and
duped
and
cheated
and
all
but
disgraced
by
the
very
people
on
whom
he
had
looked
down
from
a
fancied
superiority
and
so
he
laughed
and
as
he
laughed
his
hands
swelled
up
to
the
size
of
pillows
and
he
thought
that
he
was
dressed
in
a
loose
garment
spotted
all
over
with
great
spots
and
that
he
was
standing
on
a
stage
before
these
grave
silent
hillmen
the
light
came
in
through
a
square
just
behind
them
in
the
front
row
sat
mary
looking
at
him
with
trusting
eyes
and
he
was
revolving
these
hands
like
pillows
around
each
other
trying
to
make
the
sombre
men
and
the
wistful
girl
laugh
with
him
while
over
and
over
certain
words
slipped
in
between
his
cachinnations
like
stray
through
a
rattle
of
drums
i
have
no
fresh
motley
for
my
lady
amusement
he
was
saying
to
her
no
new
philosophies
to
spread
out
for
my
lady
inspection
no
bright
pictures
to
display
for
my
lady
pleasure
and
so
i
like
a
poor
minstrel
whose
harp
has
been
broken
yet
dare
beg
at
the
castle
gate
for
a
crumb
of
my
lady
bounty
at
which
he
would
have
wept
but
could
only
laugh
louder
and
louder
then
dimly
he
knew
again
he
was
in
his
own
room
and
he
felt
that
several
people
were
moving
back
and
forth
quickly
he
tried
to
rise
but
could
not
and
he
knew
that
he
was
slipping
back
to
the
hall
and
the
solemn
crowd
of
men
he
did
not
want
to
go
he
grasped
convulsively
at
the
blanket
with
his
sound
hand
and
shrieked
aloud
i
am
sick
i
am
sick
i
am
sick
he
cried
louder
and
louder
some
one
laid
a
cool
hand
on
his
forehead
and
he
lay
quiet
and
smiled
contentedly
the
room
and
the
people
became
wraithlike
he
saw
them
still
but
he
saw
through
them
to
a
reality
of
soft
meadows
and
summer
skies
from
which
mary
leaned
resting
her
hand
on
his
brow
voices
spoke
but
muffled
as
though
by
many
veils
they
talked
of
various
things
it
the
mountain
fever
he
heard
one
say
it
a
wonder
he
escaped
it
so
long
then
the
cool
hand
was
withdrawn
from
his
brow
and
inexorably
he
was
hurried
back
into
the
land
of
visions
chapter
xxii
flower
o
the
world
bennington
de
laney
found
himself
lying
comfortably
in
bed
listening
with
closed
eyes
to
a
number
of
sounds
of
these
there
most
impressed
him
two
they
were
a
certain
rhythmical
muffled
beat
punctuated
at
intervals
by
a
slight
rustling
of
paper
and
a
series
of
metallic
clicks
softened
somewhat
by
distance
after
a
time
it
occurred
to
him
to
open
his
eyes
at
once
he
noticed
two
things
more
that
he
had
some
way
acquired
fresh
white
sheets
for
his
bed
and
that
on
a
little
table
near
the
foot
of
his
bunk
stood
a
vase
of
flowers
these
two
new
impressions
satisfied
him
for
some
time
he
brooded
over
them
slowly
for
his
brain
was
weak
then
he
allowed
his
gaze
to
wander
to
the
window
from
above
its
upper
sash
depended
two
long
white
curtains
of
some
lacelike
material
freshly
starched
and
with
deep
edges
ruffled
slightly
in
a
pleasing
fashion
they
stirred
slowly
in
the
warm
air
from
the
window
bennington
watched
them
lazily
breathing
with
pleasure
the
balmy
smell
of
pine
and
listening
to
the
sounds
the
clinking
noises
came
through
the
open
window
he
knew
now
that
they
meant
the
impact
of
sledge
on
drill
some
one
was
drilling
somewhere
his
glance
roved
on
and
rested
without
surprise
on
a
girl
in
a
rocking
chair
swaying
softly
to
and
fro
and
reading
a
book
the
turning
of
whose
leaves
had
caused
the
rustling
of
paper
which
he
had
noticed
first
for
a
long
time
he
lay
silent
and
contented
her
fine
brown
hair
had
been
drawn
back
smoothly
away
from
her
forehead
into
a
loose
knot
she
was
dressed
in
a
simple
gown
of
white
soft
and
resting
on
the
curves
of
her
slender
figure
as
lightly
as
down
on
the
surface
of
the
warm
meadows
from
beneath
the
full
skirt
peeped
a
little
slippered
foot
which
tapped
the
floor
rhythmically
as
the
chair
rocked
to
and
fro
finally
she
glanced
up
and
discovered
him
locking
at
her
she
arose
and
came
to
the
bedside
her
finger
on
her
lips
you
must
talk
she
said
sweetly
a
great
joy
in
her
eyes
i
so
glad
you
better
she
left
the
room
and
returned
in
a
little
time
with
a
bowl
of
chicken
broth
which
she
fed
him
with
a
spoon
it
tasted
very
good
to
him
and
he
felt
the
stronger
for
it
but
as
yet
his
voice
seemed
a
long
distance
away
when
she
turned
to
leave
the
room
however
he
murmured
inarticulately
and
attempted
to
stir
she
came
back
to
the
bed
at
once
i
be
back
in
a
minute
she
said
gently
but
seeing
some
look
of
pleading
in
his
eyes
she
put
the
empty
bowl
and
spoon
on
the
little
table
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
near
the
bed
he
smiled
and
then
closing
his
eyes
fell
asleep
outside
the
borders
of
the
land
of
visions
and
with
the
music
of
a
woman
voice
haunting
the
last
moments
of
his
consciousness
after
the
fever
had
once
broken
his
return
to
strength
was
rapid
although
accompanied
by
delirium
and
though
running
its
full
course
of
weeks
the
mountain
fever
is
not
as
intense
as
typhoid
the
exhaustion
of
the
vital
forces
is
not
as
great
and
recuperation
is
easier
in
two
days
bennington
was
sitting
up
in
bed
possessed
of
an
appetite
that
threatened
to
depopulate
entirely
the
little
log
chicken
coop
he
found
that
the
tenancy
of
the
camp
had
materially
changed
lawton
and
miss
fay
had
moved
in
bag
and
baggage
but
without
the
inquisitive
maude
bennington
was
glad
to
observe
lawton
in
the
presence
of
an
emergency
turned
out
to
be
helpful
in
every
way
she
knew
all
about
mountain
fevers
for
one
thing
and
as
the
country
was
not
yet
blessed
with
a
doctor
this
was
not
an
unimportant
item
then
too
she
was
a
most
capable
housekeeper
she
cooked
marketed
swept
dusted
and
tyrannized
over
the
mere
men
in
a
manner
to
be
envied
even
by
a
new
england
dame
fay
and
the
leslies
had
also
taken
up
their
quarters
in
the
camp
old
mizzou
and
the
arthurs
had
gone
the
old
bunk
house
now
accommodated
a
gang
of
miners
who
had
been
engaged
by
fay
to
do
the
necessary
assessment
work
altogether
the
camp
was
very
populous
and
lively
after
a
little
bennington
learned
of
everything
that
had
happened
during
the
three
weeks
of
his
sickness
it
all
came
out
in
a
series
of
charming
conversations
when
in
the
evening
twilight
they
gathered
in
the
room
where
the
sick
man
lay
mary
as
bennington
still
liked
to
name
her
occupied
the
rocking
chair
and
the
three
young
men
distributed
themselves
as
best
suited
them
it
was
most
homelike
and
resting
bennington
had
never
before
experienced
the
delight
of
seeing
a
young
girl
about
a
house
and
he
enjoyed
to
the
utmost
the
deft
little
touches
by
which
is
imparted
that
airily
feminine
appearance
to
a
room
or
more
subtly
the
mere
spirit
of
daintiness
which
breathes
always
from
a
woman
of
the
right
sort
he
felt
there
was
added
a
newer
and
calmer
element
of
joy
to
his
love
during
the
first
period
of
his
illness
then
jim
fay
and
the
leslie
brothers
had
worked
energetically
relocating
the
claims
while
lawton
and
miss
fay
had
taken
charge
of
the
house
by
the
end
of
the
first
day
the
job
was
finished
the
question
then
came
up
as
to
the
disposition
of
the
prisoners
we
did
want
the
nuisance
of
a
prosecution
said
fay
because
that
would
mean
that
these
mossbacks
could
drag
us
off
to
rapid
city
any
old
time
as
witnesses
and
keep
us
there
indefinitely
neither
did
we
want
to
let
them
off
they
made
us
altogether
too
much
trouble
for
that
bert
here
suggested
a
very
simple
way
out
i
went
down
to
spanish
gulch
and
told
the
boys
the
whole
story
from
start
to
finish
well
it
is
hard
to
handle
a
western
crowd
if
you
go
at
it
right
the
boys
always
thought
you
had
good
stuff
in
you
since
you
rode
the
horse
and
smashed
leary
face
that
night
it
would
have
been
easy
to
have
cooked
up
all
kinds
of
trouble
for
our
precious
gang
but
i
managed
to
get
the
boys
in
a
frivolous
mood
so
they
merely
came
up
and
had
fun
i
should
say
they
did
bert
interjected
they
dragged
the
crowd
out
of
the
shaft
and
they
were
a
proposition
i
can
tell
you
and
stood
them
up
in
a
row
they
shaved
half
of
davidson
head
and
half
his
beard
on
opposite
sides
they
left
tufts
of
hair
all
over
arthur
they
made
a
star
on
the
top
of
slayton
crown
then
they
put
the
men
clothes
on
wrong
side
before
and
tied
them
facing
the
rear
on
three
scrubby
little
burros
then
the
whole
outfit
was
started
toward
deadwood
the
boys
took
them
as
far
as
blue
lead
where
they
delivered
them
over
to
the
gang
there
with
instructions
to
pass
them
along
they
probably
got
to
deadwood
i
do
know
become
of
them
since
i
think
it
was
cruel
put
in
miss
fay
decidedly
perhaps
but
it
was
better
than
hanging
them
what
became
of
mrs
arthur
asked
the
invalid
i
shipped
her
to
deadwood
with
a
little
money
poor
creature
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
her
if
her
husband
never
did
show
up
she
get
along
better
without
him
the
claims
located
and
the
sharpers
got
rid
of
fay
proceeded
at
once
to
put
the
assessment
work
under
way
in
this
his
long
western
experience
and
his
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
men
stood
him
in
such
good
stead
that
he
was
enabled
to
contract
the
work
at
a
cheaper
rate
than
bishop
estimate
i
wrote
to
bishop
he
said
and
told
him
all
about
it
in
his
answer
which
i
show
you
he
took
all
the
blame
to
himself
just
as
i
anticipated
he
would
and
he
so
tickled
to
death
over
the
showing
made
by
the
assays
that
he
coming
out
here
himself
to
see
about
development
so
i
afraid
you
going
to
lose
your
job
i
not
sorry
to
go
home
but
i
sorry
to
leave
the
hills
he
looked
wistfully
through
the
twilight
toward
mary
slender
figure
outlined
against
the
window
the
three
men
caught
the
glance
and
began
at
once
to
talk
in
low
tones
to
each
other
in
a
moment
they
went
out
somehow
on
returning
from
the
land
of
visions
ben
found
that
the
world
had
moved
and
that
one
of
the
results
of
the
movement
was
that
many
things
were
taken
for
granted
by
the
little
community
of
four
who
surrounded
him
it
was
as
though
the
tangle
had
unravelled
quietly
while
he
slept
she
leaned
toward
him
shyly
and
whispered
something
to
his
ear
he
smiled
contentedly
they
talked
then
long
and
comfortably
in
the
dusk
about
how
the
leslies
had
written
the
letter
how
much
trouble
she
had
taken
to
conceal
her
real
identity
and
all
the
rest
i
sent
bill
lawton
up
to
warn
your
camp
the
first
day
i
met
you
said
she
why
i
remember
he
cried
he
was
there
when
i
got
back
and
they
talked
on
of
their
many
experiences
in
the
fashion
of
lovers
and
how
they
had
come
to
care
for
each
other
and
when
i
made
up
my
mind
it
was
so
foolish
a
joke
she
confessed
that
i
determined
to
tell
you
all
about
it
you
remember
i
had
something
to
tell
you
at
the
pioneer
picnic
that
was
it
but
then
you
remember
the
girl
in
the
train
and
how
when
she
looked
at
us
you
turned
away
i
remember
that
well
enough
replied
bennington
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
it
was
a
perfectly
natural
thing
to
do
dearest
i
see
that
plainly
enough
now
but
it
hurt
me
a
little
that
you
should
be
ashamed
of
me
as
a
western
girl
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
test
you
why
i
was
thinking
of
that
at
all
cried
bennington
i
was
just
ashamed
of
my
clothes
i
never
thought
of
you
she
reached
out
and
patted
his
hand
i
glad
to
hear
that
ben
dear
after
all
it
did
hurt
and
i
was
so
foolish
i
thought
if
you
were
ashamed
of
me
you
would
never
stand
the
thought
of
the
lawtons
so
i
did
not
tell
you
the
truth
then
but
resolved
to
test
you
in
that
way
foolish
little
girl
said
he
tenderly
but
it
came
out
all
right
did
it
yes
she
sighed
with
a
happy
gesture
of
the
hands
they
fell
silent
i
want
you
to
tell
me
something
dear
said
bennington
after
a
while
you
need
unless
you
want
to
but
i
thought
about
it
a
great
deal
i
will
tell
you
ben
anything
in
the
world
we
ought
to
be
frank
with
each
other
now
do
you
think
so
i
do
know
as
i
ought
to
say
anything
about
it
after
all
he
hesitated
evidently
embarrassed
but
mary
you
know
you
have
hinted
a
little
at
it
yourself
you
remember
you
said
something
once
about
losing
faith
and
being
made
hard
and
she
took
both
his
hands
in
hers
and
drew
them
closely
to
her
breast
although
he
could
not
see
her
eyes
against
the
dusk
he
knew
that
she
was
looking
at
him
steadily
listen
quietly
ben
dear
and
i
will
tell
you
before
i
came
out
here
i
thought
i
loved
a
man
and
he
well
he
did
not
treat
me
well
i
had
trusted
him
and
every
one
else
implicitly
until
the
very
moment
when
i
felt
it
very
much
and
i
came
west
with
jim
to
get
away
from
the
old
scenes
now
i
know
that
it
was
only
fascination
but
it
was
very
real
then
you
do
not
like
that
ben
do
you
the
memory
is
not
pleasant
to
me
and
yet
she
said
with
a
wistful
little
break
of
the
voice
if
it
had
been
for
that
i
would
not
have
been
the
woman
i
am
and
i
could
not
love
you
dearest
as
i
do
it
is
never
in
the
same
way
twice
but
each
time
something
better
and
higher
is
added
to
it
oh
my
darling
i
love
you
i
do
love
you
so
much
and
you
must
be
always
my
generous
poetic
as
you
are
now
she
strained
his
hands
to
her
as
though
afraid
he
would
slip
from
her
clasp
all
that
is
ideal
so
soon
hardens
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
your
changing
bennington
leaned
forward
and
their
lips
met
we
will
forgive
him
he
murmured
and
what
that
remark
had
to
do
with
it
only
our
gentler
readers
will
be
able
to
say
ah
the
delicious
throbbing
silence
after
the
first
kiss
what
was
your
decision
that
afternoon
on
the
rock
ben
you
never
told
me
she
asked
presently
in
a
lighter
tone
would
you
have
taken
me
in
spite
of
my
family
he
laughed
with
faint
mischief
before
i
tell
you
i
want
to
ask
something
he
said
in
his
turn
supposing
i
had
decided
that
even
though
i
loved
you
i
must
give
you
up
because
of
my
duty
to
my
family
suppose
that
i
say
what
would
have
done
would
your
love
for
me
have
been
so
strong
that
you
would
have
finally
confessed
to
me
the
fact
that
the
lawtons
were
not
your
parents
or
would
you
have
thrown
me
over
entirely
because
you
thought
i
did
not
love
you
enough
to
take
you
for
yourself
she
considered
the
matter
seriously
for
some
little
time
ben
i
do
know
she
confessed
at
last
frankly
i
ca
tell
no
more
can
i
sweetheart
i
had
decided
she
puckered
her
brows
in
the
darkness
with
genuine
distress
women
worry
more
than
men
over
past
intangibilities
he
smiled
comfortably
to
himself
for
in
his
grasp
he
held
unresisting
the
dearest
little
hand
in
the
world
outside
the
night
of
the
hills
was
stealing
here
and
there
in
sighs
and
silences
from
the
darkness
came
the
high
sweet
tenor
of
bert
leslie
voice
in
the
words
of
a
song
a
sailor
to
the
sea
a
hunter
to
the
pines
and
sea
and
pines
alike
to
joy
the
rover
the
to
the
nostrils
of
the
lover
of
the
trail
and
hearts
to
hearts
the
whole
world
over
through
and
through
the
words
of
the
song
like
a
fine
silver
wire
through
richer
cloth
of
gold
twined
the
tremulous
notes
of
the
sparrow
the
nightingale
of
the
north
the
dear
old
hills
he
murmured
tenderly
we
must
come
back
to
them
often
sweetheart
i
wish
i
i
knew
she
cried
holding
his
hand
tighter
knew
what
he
asked
surprised
what
you
have
done
and
what
i
have
done
well
he
replied
with
a
happy
sigh
i
know
what
i
to
do
and
that
quite
enough
for
me
the
end
