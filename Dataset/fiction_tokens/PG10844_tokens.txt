a
gentleman
from
mississippi
chapter
i
practical
politics
that
bids
him
flout
the
law
he
makes
that
bids
him
make
the
law
he
flouts
in
buoyant
spirit
the
hon
charles
norton
rode
up
the
bridle
path
leading
through
the
langdon
plantation
to
the
old
antebellum
homestead
which
on
a
shaded
knoll
overlooked
the
winding
waters
of
the
pearl
river
no
finer
prospect
was
to
be
had
in
all
mississippi
than
greeted
the
eye
from
the
wide
southwest
porch
where
on
warm
evenings
the
langdons
and
their
frequent
guests
gathered
to
dine
or
to
watch
the
golden
splendor
of
the
dying
sun
the
langdon
family
had
long
been
a
power
in
the
south
its
sons
fought
under
andrew
jackson
at
new
orleans
under
zachary
taylor
in
the
war
with
mexico
and
in
the
civil
war
men
of
that
name
left
their
blood
on
the
fields
of
antietam
shiloh
the
wilderness
and
gettysburg
but
this
family
of
fighting
men
of
unselfish
patriots
had
also
marked
influence
in
the
ways
of
peace
as
real
patriots
should
generations
of
langdons
had
taken
deepest
pride
in
developing
the
hundreds
of
acres
of
cotton
land
whose
thousands
of
rows
planted
each
april
spread
open
the
silvery
lined
bolls
in
july
and
august
and
the
ripened
cotton
fiber
pure
white
beneath
the
sun
gave
from
a
distance
the
picture
of
an
expanse
of
driven
snow
the
hon
charles
norton
had
reason
for
feeling
well
pleased
with
the
world
as
he
fastened
his
bay
virginia
hunter
to
a
convenient
post
and
strode
up
the
steps
of
the
mansion
which
was
a
characteristic
survivor
of
the
old
south
the
south
of
gilded
romance
and
of
gripping
tragedy
now
in
this
second
year
of
his
first
term
as
congressman
and
a
promising
member
of
the
younger
set
of
southern
lawyers
he
had
just
taken
active
part
in
securing
the
election
of
colonel
william
langdon
present
head
of
the
family
to
the
united
states
senate
though
the
ultimate
action
of
the
legislature
had
been
really
brought
about
by
a
lifelong
friend
of
colonel
langdon
the
senior
senator
from
the
state
james
stevens
who
had
not
hesitated
to
flatter
norton
and
use
him
as
a
this
use
the
hon
charles
norton
seemed
to
consider
an
honor
of
large
proportions
not
every
congressman
can
hope
for
intimacy
with
a
senator
norton
believed
that
his
work
for
langdon
would
win
him
the
gratitude
and
thus
further
his
ambition
to
marry
carolina
the
planter
oldest
daughter
whose
beauty
made
her
the
recipient
of
many
attentions
a
complacent
gleam
shone
in
norton
eyes
as
they
swept
over
the
fertile
acres
of
the
plantation
he
thought
of
the
material
interest
he
might
one
day
have
in
them
if
his
suit
for
the
hand
of
carolina
progressed
favorably
suddenly
his
reverie
was
interrupted
by
the
voice
of
young
randolph
langdon
a
spirited
lad
in
his
early
twenties
who
had
just
been
made
plantation
manager
by
his
father
well
how
is
the
honorable
said
randolph
approaching
from
the
doorway
i
did
think
a
congressman
could
be
spared
from
washington
but
rarely
especially
when
the
papers
say
the
country
needs
such
a
lot
of
saving
oh
this
the
country
talk
goes
all
right
in
the
story
books
replied
norton
who
exercised
considerable
influence
over
the
youth
through
a
long
acquaintanceship
and
by
frequently
taking
him
into
his
confidence
but
this
country
can
take
pretty
good
care
of
itself
in
congress
we
representatives
put
the
job
of
saving
it
over
on
the
senate
and
the
senate
hands
back
the
job
to
us
so
everybody
business
is
anybody
a
fine
scheme
so
long
as
we
have
a
president
who
keeps
his
hands
off
and
does
but
how
about
the
speeches
and
the
bills
broke
in
randolph
i
thought
yes
yes
to
be
sure
the
congressman
quickly
added
nearly
all
of
us
introduce
these
reform
bills
when
they
printed
at
government
expense
we
send
copies
carried
free
by
the
department
to
our
constituents
and
when
we
allow
the
bills
to
die
in
some
committee
we
can
always
blame
the
committee
but
if
there
a
big
fight
by
our
constituents
over
the
bill
we
let
it
pass
the
house
but
arrange
to
kill
it
in
the
senate
then
we
do
the
same
thing
for
the
senators
like
in
every
other
business
my
boy
continued
norton
as
he
led
the
way
into
the
house
it
a
case
of
tickle
me
and
tickle
you
in
politics
and
do
let
any
one
fool
you
about
the
speeches
either
they
are
pretty
things
to
mail
to
the
voters
but
all
the
wise
boys
in
washington
know
they
are
meant
seriously
all
play
acting
and
there
are
better
actors
in
the
senate
than
henry
irving
or
edwin
booth
ever
were
i
do
think
my
father
looks
at
things
in
the
way
you
do
charlie
no
well
maybe
he
does
now
but
he
will
later
on
when
he
takes
his
seat
in
the
senate
if
he
is
wise
enough
to
play
around
with
the
rest
of
the
senators
he
wo
get
any
bills
passed
especially
any
bill
carrying
an
appropriation
or
of
any
other
particular
importance
what
ejaculated
the
planter
son
do
you
mean
to
say
that
if
father
wo
do
what
the
other
senators
want
him
to
do
they
will
combine
against
him
and
destroy
his
usefulness
make
him
powerless
a
failure
the
congressman
smiled
patronizingly
on
the
youth
why
of
course
they
will
that
politics
practical
politics
the
only
kind
known
in
washington
you
see
but
the
leaders
of
the
great
parties
cried
the
young
plantation
manager
in
amazement
why
do
they
prevent
this
because
they
invented
the
system
and
because
political
party
differences
do
amount
to
a
whole
lot
much
of
the
time
in
washington
the
politicians
do
most
of
their
criticizing
of
the
other
party
away
from
washington
where
the
voters
can
hear
them
but
when
circumstances
sometimes
force
a
man
to
rise
to
assail
the
other
side
in
congress
he
afterward
apologizes
in
secret
for
his
words
or
sometimes
he
apologizes
beforehand
saying
got
to
hand
out
some
hot
shot
to
you
fellows
just
to
please
a
crowd
of
sovereign
voters
from
my
district
who
have
come
up
to
washington
to
see
me
perform
so
of
course
i
got
to
make
a
showing
do
mind
what
i
say
you
know
i
do
mean
it
but
the
old
fogies
will
go
back
home
and
tell
their
neighbors
what
a
reformer
i
be
is
that
the
way
you
represent
your
district
norton
asked
planter
langdon
who
at
this
juncture
entered
the
room
no
no
langdon
i
should
say
senator
now
i
suppose
i
was
merely
telling
randolph
how
some
legislators
conduct
themselves
the
paused
momentarily
gazing
at
the
congressman
who
tall
and
athletic
was
visibly
uneasy
at
having
his
conversation
with
randolph
overheard
by
the
father
no
doubt
it
wo
be
all
plain
sailing
in
washington
for
an
man
like
me
but
i
believe
in
the
american
people
and
the
men
they
send
to
congress
slowly
spoke
the
planter
senator
stevens
for
instance
he
has
always
stood
for
the
rights
of
the
people
i
read
all
his
speeches
just
why
he
brought
about
my
election
it
is
hard
to
tell
for
i
been
a
planter
all
my
life
except
when
i
fought
under
beauregard
i
feel
that
he
did
it
out
of
friendship
and
i
simply
ca
say
how
much
i
appreciate
the
honor
i
am
indebted
to
you
too
congressman
tactfully
disclaiming
any
credit
for
his
work
only
congressional
training
in
repression
enabled
him
to
refrain
from
smiling
at
langdon
innocence
his
belief
in
stevens
sincerity
and
his
wonder
over
his
election
stevens
the
keen
cold
and
resourceful
who
forced
his
officeholders
to
yield
him
parts
of
their
government
salaries
stevens
who
marketed
to
railway
companies
his
influence
with
the
department
of
justice
stevens
who
was
a
republican
in
the
committee
room
in
washington
and
a
democrat
on
the
platform
in
mississippi
stevens
who
had
consummated
the
deal
with
martin
sanders
boss
of
seven
counties
to
elect
langdon
because
of
the
planter
trustfulness
and
simplicity
of
character
which
should
make
him
easy
to
influence
and
to
handle
in
the
matter
of
the
gulf
naval
base
project
the
entry
of
carolina
langdon
and
her
younger
sister
hope
georgia
gave
norton
a
welcome
opportunity
to
shift
the
trend
of
conversation
you
ladies
will
have
a
gay
time
in
washington
he
began
after
directing
a
particularly
enthusiastic
greeting
to
carolina
you
will
be
in
great
demand
at
all
the
big
affairs
and
i
do
think
you
will
ever
want
to
come
back
to
old
mississippi
forty
miles
from
a
railroad
with
few
chances
to
wear
your
new
york
gowns
carolina
spoke
quickly
her
face
flushing
at
the
thought
of
the
new
vista
of
life
now
opening
yes
i
have
always
longed
to
be
a
part
of
the
real
life
of
this
world
the
life
of
constant
action
meeting
new
people
every
day
and
prominent
people
balls
receptions
teas
theater
parties
afternoon
drives
plenty
of
money
and
plenty
of
gayety
are
what
i
want
i
not
a
bit
like
hope
georgia
who
thinks
these
ideas
are
extravagant
because
she
has
not
seen
real
life
yet
carolina
you
must
not
think
me
your
little
sister
now
i
have
seen
life
have
i
spent
a
week
in
jackson
that
enough
proof
you
know
all
about
life
i
sure
miss
hope
georgia
smilingly
remarked
norton
later
rising
to
join
planter
langdon
on
the
veranda
where
he
had
gone
to
smoke
the
congressman
gazed
intently
at
carolina
you
will
probably
forget
your
old
friends
when
you
enter
the
dizzy
social
race
in
washington
no
charlie
i
could
forget
you
anyhow
you
will
be
there
too
i
shall
depend
on
you
a
great
deal
to
take
me
about
unless
you
are
too
busy
making
speeches
and
fighting
your
opponents
again
it
was
norton
turn
to
be
inwardly
amused
at
the
political
ignorance
of
the
langdon
family
speeches
the
congressman
does
make
speeches
in
washington
because
no
one
cares
what
he
thinks
except
the
lobbyists
whose
business
it
is
to
provide
new
members
with
a
complete
set
of
thoughts
neither
does
he
have
opponents
he
is
not
considered
important
enough
by
the
veterans
to
be
opposed
skilfully
approaching
the
subject
which
next
to
carolina
langdon
had
been
uppermost
in
his
mind
during
his
visit
norton
asked
the
on
joining
him
if
he
did
not
believe
that
the
entire
south
would
benefit
if
the
plan
to
establish
a
naval
base
on
the
gulf
was
successfully
carried
through
most
certainly
i
do
and
as
i
said
during
the
senatorial
fight
the
whole
country
as
well
will
be
the
gainer
responded
langdon
do
you
think
the
people
who
want
altacoola
chosen
as
the
site
have
the
best
arguments
was
the
visitor
next
question
the
reply
to
which
he
anxiously
awaited
yes
i
do
from
what
i
already
heard
but
i
have
heard
very
much
of
what
the
folks
who
advocate
other
sites
have
to
say
so
until
i
heard
all
sides
and
made
my
own
examination
i
could
give
any
one
my
final
answer
but
altacoola
seems
to
have
the
necessary
qualifications
senator
stevens
is
in
favor
of
altacoola
eagerly
suggested
norton
yes
and
that
a
pretty
good
argument
in
its
favor
responded
langdon
norton
now
excused
himself
pleading
an
appointment
with
a
client
at
a
neighboring
village
waving
farewell
to
carolina
and
hope
georgia
who
stood
at
a
window
he
rode
away
the
old
man
is
sure
to
be
all
right
he
muttered
he
leans
toward
altacoola
and
believes
in
stevens
he
lean
some
more
until
he
falls
over
into
the
trap
there
a
fortune
in
sight
within
reach
langdon
has
faith
in
his
friends
he
wo
suspect
a
thing
still
another
thought
occurred
to
the
hon
charles
norton
stevens
elected
langdon
out
of
friendship
he
chuckled
gleefully
that
will
be
well
worth
telling
in
washington
chapter
ii
the
wars
of
peace
big
bill
langdon
was
the
term
by
which
the
new
senator
from
mississippi
had
been
affectionately
known
to
his
intimates
for
years
he
carried
his
pounds
with
ease
bespeaking
great
muscular
power
in
spite
of
his
gray
hairs
his
rugged
courage
unswerving
honesty
and
ready
belief
in
his
friends
won
him
a
loyal
following
some
of
whom
frequently
repeated
what
was
known
as
bill
langdon
golden
rule
there
never
was
a
man
yet
who
did
have
some
good
in
him
but
most
folks
do
know
this
because
their
own
virtues
pop
up
and
blind
when
they
look
at
somebody
else
at
the
reunions
of
his
old
war
comrades
langdon
was
always
depended
on
to
describe
once
again
how
the
third
mississippi
charged
at
crawfordsville
and
defeated
the
eighth
illinois
but
the
stirring
events
of
the
past
had
served
to
increase
the
planter
fondness
for
his
home
life
and
his
children
whose
mother
had
died
years
before
at
times
he
regretted
that
his
unexpected
political
duties
would
take
him
away
from
the
old
plantation
even
though
the
enthusiastic
approval
of
carolina
and
hope
georgia
proved
considerable
compensation
although
not
sworn
in
as
senator
colonel
langdon
political
duties
were
already
pressing
a
few
days
after
congressman
norton
visit
he
sat
in
his
library
conferring
with
several
prominent
citizens
of
his
county
regarding
a
plan
to
ask
congress
to
appropriate
money
to
dredge
a
portion
of
the
channel
of
the
pearl
river
which
would
greatly
aid
a
large
section
of
the
state
during
the
deliberations
the
name
of
martin
sanders
was
announced
by
jackson
the
colonel
gravely
decorous
negro
bodyguard
who
boasted
that
he
wuz
brung
up
by
cunel
marse
langdon
suh
a
mississippi
cunel
suh
sence
long
befo
de
wah
and
way
befo
dat
suh
show
sanders
right
in
commanded
colonel
langdon
senator
spoke
sanders
the
boss
of
seven
counties
as
he
entered
glancing
around
the
room
he
continued
bending
toward
the
colonel
and
muffling
his
now
whispering
voice
with
his
hand
i
want
to
speak
to
you
alone
i
here
on
politics
that
all
right
but
these
gentlemen
here
are
my
friends
and
constituents
was
the
reply
in
no
uncertain
voice
when
i
talk
politics
they
have
a
perfect
right
to
hear
what
i
as
their
senator
say
out
with
it
mr
sanders
as
sanders
was
introduced
to
the
members
of
the
conference
he
grew
red
in
the
face
and
stared
at
langdon
amazed
at
last
he
had
discovered
something
new
in
politics

he
finally
blurted
out

the
visitor
stammered
i
am
in
politics
for
my
party
sake
just
like
everybody
else
and
sanders
grinned
suggestively
at
his
questioner
have

anything
further
to
say
asked
langdon
in
a
tone
hinting
that
he
would
like
to
be
rid
of
his
caller

cried
the
angry
boss
pounding
the
long
table
before
which
langdon
sat
i
answer
you
almighty
quick
retorted
the
now
thoroughly
aroused
rising
and
shaking
his
clenched
fist
at
sanders
those
twelve
votes

yours

yes

noble
legislators

pocket
an
that
where
i
mostly

aroun

like
you

men
for

i
told
you
at
the
capitol
that
i
would
not
make
you
or
anybody
else
any
promises
you
voted
them
for
me
of
your
own
accord
that
my
answer
at
this
point
the
gentlemen
of
the
county
present
when
sanders
entered
and
who
had
no
desire
to
witness
further
the
unpleasant
episode
rose
to
leave
in
spite
of
the
urgent
request
of
colonel
langdon
that
they
remain
the
only
one
reluctant
to
go
was
deacon
amos
smallwood
who
coming
to
the
plantation
to
seek
employment
for
his
son
had
not
been
denied
of
his
desire
to
join
the
assemblage
of
his
neighbors
last
to
move
toward
the
door
he
stopped
in
front
of
sanders
stretched
his
five
feet
three
inches
of
stature
on
tiptoe
and
shook
a
withered
fist
in
the
boss
firmly
set
determined
face
infamous
shrieked
the
deacon
you
a
monster
unrighteous
you
should
have
belonged
to
the
political
machine
of
cataline
or
pontius
pilate
never
heard
tell
o
them
muttered
sanders
deeply
puzzled
guess
they
was
never
in
mississippi
in
my
time
his
accompanying
gesture
of
perplexity
caused
the
deacon
to
hasten
his
exit
tripping
over
the
leg
of
a
chair
he
fell
headlong
into
the
arms
of
the
watchful
jackson
who
received
the
deacon
blessing
for
uplifting
the
righteous
in
the
hour
of
their
fall
relieved
at
the
departure
of
the
witnesses
sanders
showed
increased
aggressiveness
to
be
sure
senator
you
were
careful
not
to
personally
promise
me
anything
for
my
support
at
the
election
as
you
say
the
leader
sneered
but
you
had
jim
stevens
to
make
promises
for
you
which
was
smooth
absolute
an
artistic
smooth
stop
sir
langdon
furiously
shouted
you
forget
sir
that
your
insinuation
is
an
insult
to
a
man
elected
senator
from
mississippi
an
insult
to
my
state
and
to
my
friend
senator
stevens
who
i
know
would
make
you
no
promises
for
me
for
he
had
not
my
authority
certainly
you
a
senator
but
what
a
senator
anyhow
i
tell
you
mr
colonel
langdon
a
senator
is
a
man
who
holds
out
for
his
own
pocket
as
much
as
us
fellows
that
make
him
will
stand
for
when
we
do
get
our
rightful
share
he
through
with
a
sudden
start
as
though
to
spring
at
sanders
throat
langdon
with
compressed
lips
and
eyes
blazing
grasped
the
edge
of
the
table
with
a
grip
that
threatened
to
rend
the
polished
boards
with
intensest
effort
he
slowly
regained
control
of
himself
his
fury
had
actually
weakened
him
his
knees
shook
and
he
sank
weakly
into
a
chair
when
he
finally
spoke
his
voice
was
strained
and
laborious
sanders
you
and
i
sir
must
never
meet
again
because
i
might
not
succeed
in
keeping
my
hands
off
you
what
would
my
old
comrades
of
the
third
mississippi
say
if
they
saw
me
sitting
here
and
you
there
with
a
whole
body
sir
after
what
you
have
said
they
would
not
believe
their
eyes
thank
god
sir
they
would
all
go
over
to
stuart
city
and
buy
new
glasses
sir
a
suspicious
moisture
appeared
on
the
cheeks
which
he
could
not
dry
too
quickly
to
escape
observation
but
i
had
to
let
you
stay
sir
because
you
the
sole
accuser
are
the
only
one
who
can
tell
me
what
i
must
know
what
do
you
want
to
know
asked
sanders
who
had
realized
his
great
mistake
in
losing
his
temper
in
talking
as
openly
and
as
violently
as
he
had
and
in
dragging
the
name
of
senator
stevens
into
the
controversy
he
must
try
to
keep
stevens
from
hearing
of
this
blunder
for
jim
stevens
knew
as
well
as
he
did
he
that
the
man
who
loses
his
temper
like
the
man
who
talks
too
much
is
of
no
use
in
politics
i
want
to
know
how
you
formed
your
opinion
of
political
matters
of
senators
is
it
possible
sir
that
you
have
actual
knowledge
of
actual
happenings
that
give
you
the
right
to
talk
as
you
have
i
want
to
know
if
i
must
feel
shame
feel
disgrace
sir
to
be
a
senator
from
mississippi
that
state
sir
that
the
almighty
himself
sir
would
choose
to
live
in
if
he
came
to
earth
there
there
senator
do
take
too
seriously
what
i
have
said
sanders
replied
in
reassuring
tone
having
outlined
his
course
of
action
i
lost
my
head
because
you
would
promise
me
something
i
needed
that
appointment
for
hagley
what
i
said
about
senators
such
was
all
wild
words
nothin
in
why
how
could
there
be
senator
this
query
was
a
happy
afterthought
which
sanders
craftily
suggested
in
a
designedly
artless
manner
just
what
i
thought
and
know
exclaimed
langdon
sharply
it
could
be
it
is
possible
now
you
go
sir
and
let
it
be
your
greatest
disgrace
that
you
are
not
fit
to
enter
any
house
oh
do
rub
it
in
too
hard
senator
you
may
need
my
help
some
day
but
you
have
to
deliver
the
goods
beforehand
i
said
i
goin
but
here
a
tip
do
blame
me
for
fightin
you
got
to
fight
to
live
i
a
human
bein
an
humans
are
pretty
much
the
same
all
over
the
world
all
except
you
you
only
half
natural
the
rest
of
you
is
reformer
after
sanders
departure
the
colonel
sat
at
his
table
his
head
resting
in
his
hand
the
events
of
the
day
crowding
his
brain
bewilderingly
the
battles
of
peace
are
worse
than
any
beauregard
ever
led
me
into
he
murmured
fighting
o
conquer
oneself
is
harder
than
turning
the
left
flank
of
the
eighth
illinois
in
an
enfilading
fire
but
the
new
senator
from
mississippi
did
not
know
that
for
him
the
wars
of
peace
had
only
just
begun
that
perhaps
his
own
flesh
and
blood
and
that
of
the
wife
and
mother
who
had
gone
before
would
turn
traitor
to
his
colors
in
the
very
thickest
of
the
fray
chapter
iii
how
to
please
a
senator
the
international
hotel
in
washington
was
all
hustle
and
bustle
was
it
not
preparing
for
its
first
senator
since
no
less
a
personage
than
the
hon
william
langdon
of
mississippi
said
to
be
a
warm
personal
friend
of
senator
stevens
one
of
the
leading
members
of
his
party
at
the
capital
had
engaged
a
suit
of
rooms
for
himself
and
two
daughters
ai
it
the
limit
remarked
the
chief
clerk
to
bud
haines
correspondent
of
the
new
york
the
senator
wrote
us
that
he
was
coming
here
because
his
old
friend
the
late
senator
moseley
said
back
in
that
this
was
the
best
hotel
in
washington
and
where
all
the
prominent
men
ought
to
stay
haines
the
ablest
political
reporter
in
washington
had
come
to
the
international
to
interview
the
new
senator
to
describe
for
his
paper
what
kind
of
a
citizen
langdon
was
he
glanced
around
at
the
dingy
woodwork
the
worn
cushions
the
nicked
and
uneven
tiles
of
the
hotel
lobby
and
smiled
at
the
clerk
well
if
this
is
the
new
idea
of
princely
luxury
he
will
fit
right
into
the
senatorial
atmosphere
both
laughed
derisively
by
the
way
added
haines
i
suppose
you
raise
your
rates
now
that
you
got
a
senator
here
the
clerk
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
register
with
a
thud
we
could
have
them
every
day
if
we
wanted
them
this
fellow
though
we
have
all
winter
i
guess
his
son
here
now
been
breaking
all
records
for
drinking
congressman
norton
of
mississippi
has
been
down
here
with
him
a
few
times
there
young
langdon
is
now
haines
turned
quickly
just
in
time
to
bump
into
a
tall
slender
young
man
who
was
walking
unevenly
in
the
direction
of
the
café
well
ca
you
see
what
you
doing
muttered
the
tall
young
man
thickly
haines
smiled
the
chap
who
has
played
halfback
four
years
on
his
college
eleven
and
held
the
boxing
championship
in
his
class
is
apt
to
be
he
does
not
have
to
take
offense
easily
besides
randolph
langdon
was
plainly
under
the
influence
of
whisky
so
haines
smiled
pleasantly
at
the
taller
young
man
beg
your
pardon
my
fault
haines
said
well
do
let
it
occur
again
mumbled
langdon
as
he
strolled
with
uneven
dignity
toward
the
door
bud
haines
laughed
i
guess
young
langdon
is
going
to
be
one
of
the
boys
is
he
he
already
one
of
them
when
it
comes
to
a
question
of
fluid
capacity
laughed
some
one
behind
him
and
bud
whirled
to
meet
the
gaze
of
his
friend
dick
gullen
representative
of
one
of
the
big
chicago
dailies
you
down
here
to
see
langdon
too
commented
bud
cullen
nodded
queer
roost
where
this
senator
is
to
hang
out
it
he
ca
be
a
rich
one
then
suggested
haines
cullen
chuckled
perhaps
he
an
honest
one
i
had
thought
of
that
you
always
were
original
dickie
commented
haines
dryly
by
the
way
what
do
you
know
about
him
nothing
except
that
the
printed
a
picture
of
his
eldest
daughter
says
she
the
queen
daughter
of
the
south
a
famous
beauty
rich
planter
for
a
father
mother
left
her
a
fortune
she
cut
quite
a
social
caper
with
this
hotel
name
on
her
cards
wo
she
broke
in
haines
as
he
led
cullen
to
a
seat
to
await
the
expected
legislator
whose
train
was
late
i
do
know
very
much
about
him
myself
said
haines
all
i
been
able
to
discover
is
that
stevens
said
the
word
which
elected
him
and
that
looks
bad
great
glory
when
i
think
what
a
senator
of
the
right
sort
has
a
chance
to
do
here
in
washington
a
nonpartisan
man
he
paused
to
shake
his
head
in
disgust
you
know
these
fellows
here
in
the
senate
do
even
see
their
chance
why
if
you
and
i
did
do
any
more
to
hold
our
jobs
than
they
do
we
be
fired
by
wire
the
first
day
they
know
just
the
old
political
game
that
all
its
a
great
game
though
bud
sighed
cullen
longingly
for
like
many
newspaper
men
he
had
the
secret
feeling
that
he
was
cut
out
to
be
a
great
politician
sure
it
a
great
game
as
a
game
agreed
haines
so
is
bridge
and
stud
poker
and
monte
and
generally
take
this
new
man
langdon
for
instance
chosen
by
stevens
he
probably
be
perfectly
obedient
perfectly
easy
going
perfectly
blind
and
perfectly
useless
what
wanted
now
is
to
get
the
work
done
not
play
the
game
thoroughly
a
cynic
through
his
years
of
experience
as
a
newspaper
man
which
had
shown
the
inside
workings
of
many
important
phases
of
the
seemingly
conventional
life
of
this
complex
world
cullen
pretended
unbounded
enthusiasm
hear
hear
he
shouted
all
you
earnest
citizens
come
vote
for
reformer
haines
i
for
you
bud
what
do
i
get
in
your
cabinet
joined
the
reformers
too
and
like
all
of
them
me
for
as
long
as
she
gives
me
a
meal
ticket
but
not
even
cullen
could
make
haines
consider
his
views
on
the
necessity
of
political
regeneration
to
be
ridiculous
his
optimism
could
not
be
snuffed
out
for
he
was
a
genuine
believer
that
the
natural
tendency
of
humankind
was
to
do
right
wrong
he
believed
to
be
the
outcome
of
unnatural
causes
this
quality
combined
with
his
practical
knowledge
of
the
world
and
his
courage
made
him
a
formidable
man
one
who
would
one
day
accomplish
big
things
if
he
got
the
chance
you
know
you
ca
shut
me
up
dick
was
his
response
to
oratorical
flight
i
going
to
have
my
say
i
do
see
why
a
senator
should
be
honest
all
i
want
them
to
do
is
to
play
a
new
game
let
at
least
seem
to
be
honest
attend
to
their
business
forget
politics
the
country
sends
them
here
to
work
and
if
they
do
the
work
the
people
really
do
care
a
hang
what
party
they
belong
to
come
out
of
it
bud
your
brain
is
wabbly
yawned
cullen
wearily
i
buy
a
drink
if
you
quiet
down
let
be
comfortable
till
this
fellow
langdon
appears
he
caught
his
friend
by
the
arm
and
in
spite
of
protest
dragged
him
off
to
the
café
just
as
young
langdon
and
congressman
norton
came
down
through
the
lobby
though
but
few
years
older
than
randolph
langdon
charles
norton
had
long
exercised
strong
influence
over
him
because
of
his
wider
experience
in
the
world
affairs
like
his
father
young
langdon
had
stayed
close
to
the
plantation
most
of
his
life
particularly
after
leaving
school
devoting
his
attention
to
studying
the
business
of
conducting
the
family
big
estate
norton
brought
him
the
atmosphere
of
the
big
outside
world
he
yearned
to
see
even
as
did
his
sister
carolina
and
he
imitated
norton
manners
his
dress
and
mode
of
speech
the
congressman
habit
of
confiding
in
randolph
a
subtle
compliment
was
deeply
appreciated
by
the
lad
who
unconsciously
became
a
continual
advertiser
of
norton
many
virtues
to
carolina
and
to
his
father
all
of
which
the
congressman
knew
that
norton
political
career
was
the
outcome
of
carolina
ambition
to
shine
in
gay
society
was
known
to
his
friends
as
well
as
his
family
and
his
desire
to
win
her
and
place
her
where
she
could
satisfy
every
whim
had
developed
almost
to
a
frenzy
seeing
evidences
of
senator
stevens
vast
influence
he
did
not
hesitate
to
seek
a
close
relationship
with
him
and
the
senator
was
clever
enough
to
lead
norton
to
consider
him
his
friend
at
the
start
of
his
political
career
norton
had
higher
ideas
of
honor
than
guided
his
actions
now
that
he
had
become
a
part
of
the
political
machine
that
controlled
his
native
state
of
mississippi
and
of
the
bipartisan
combination
that
dominated
both
houses
of
congress
in
the
interest
of
the
great
railway
and
industrial
corporations
senator
stevens
and
other
powers
had
so
distorted
norton
view
of
the
difference
between
public
and
private
interests
and
their
respective
rights
that
he
had
come
to
believe
captial
to
be
the
sacred
heritage
of
the
nation
which
must
be
protected
at
any
cost
the
acceptance
of
a
retainer
from
the
and
railroad
company
for
wholly
unnecessary
services
in
washington
only
another
way
of
buying
a
man
a
transaction
arranged
by
senator
stevens
was
but
another
stage
in
the
disintegration
of
the
young
congressman
character
but
it
brought
him
just
that
much
closer
to
the
point
where
he
could
claim
carolina
langdon
as
his
own
and
opportunity
does
not
knock
twice
at
a
man
door
unless
he
is
at
the
head
of
the
machine
norton
the
persevering
young
law
student
who
loved
the
girl
who
had
been
his
boyhood
playmate
was
now
norton
who
coveted
her
lands
who
boasted
that
he
was
on
the
inside
in
washington
who
was
on
the
way
to
fortune
if
the
new
senator
from
mississippi
would
or
could
be
forced
to
stand
in
favor
of
the
altacoola
naval
base
his
conversation
with
randolph
langdon
as
haines
and
cullen
saw
them
pass
through
the
hotel
lobby
illustrated
the
nature
of
the
norton
of
the
present
and
his
interest
in
the
altacoola
scheme
there
no
reason
why
you
should
come
in
on
the
ground
floor
in
this
proposition
randolph
he
was
urging
in
continuance
of
the
conversation
begun
over
a
table
in
the
café
no
reason
why
you
should
do
it
my
boy
why
are
you
still
a
child
or
are
you
really
a
man
you
have
now
drafts
for
have
you
yeah
agreed
langdon
chagrined
at
norton
insinuation
of
youthfulness
and
anxious
to
prove
that
he
was
really
a
man
of
affairs
i
got
the
fifty
thousand
charlie
but
but
you
see
that
the
money
for
improvements
on
the
plantation
as
father
has
put
me
in
as
manager
i
want
to
make
a
showing
you
ca
make
it
until
spring
urged
norton
the
money
got
to
lie
in
the
bank
all
winter
now
why
do
you
make
a
hundred
thousand
with
it
instead
of
letting
it
lie
idle
is
that
simple
the
younger
man
eyes
opened
wide
and
his
imagination
stimulated
by
the
special
brand
of
bourbon
whisky
norton
had
ordered
for
him
took
rapid
bounds
one
hundred
thousand
you
mean
i
could
make
a
hundred
thousand
with
my
fifty
between
now
and
spring
sure
as
a
nigger
likes
gin
replied
norton
confidently
how
asked
langdon
the
young
congressman
leaned
over
confidentially
this
is
under
your
hat
randolph
you
can
keep
quiet
langdon
nodded
eagerly
then
put
it
into
altacoola
land
the
naval
base
gasped
langdon
norton
nodded
now
you
hit
it
the
government
will
select
altacoola
for
a
naval
base
then
land
will
jump
up
to
never
and
you
clean
up
a
hundred
thousand
at
the
least
is
it
simple
there
are
a
thousand
people
with
money
who
would
just
love
to
have
this
chance
and
giving
it
to
you
because
of
our
friendship
i
want
to
do
you
a
good
turn
i
got
my
money
in
there
young
langdon
was
visibly
impressed
you
always
treated
me
right
charlie
you
been
for
me
i
know
but
suppose
the
government
does
select
altacoola
gulf
city
in
the
running
norton
laughed
sarcastically
gulf
city
is
a
big
bunch
of
mud
flats
besides
i
tell
you
something
else
just
between
us
remember
he
waited
for
the
eager
nod
before
he
went
on
the
big
men
are
behind
altacoola
standard
steel
wants
altacoola
and
what
standard
steel
wants
from
congress
you
can
bet
your
bottom
dollar
standard
steel
gets
they
know
their
business
at
no
broadway
now
then
are
you
satisfied
randolph
was
more
than
satisfied
already
he
felt
himself
rich
and
honestly
rich
too
for
norton
had
convinced
him
that
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
use
the
of
his
father
when
it
had
to
lie
in
the
bank
anyhow
all
winter
and
he
would
have
it
back
in
time
to
use
on
the
plantation
in
the
spring
when
it
was
needed
how
proud
of
him
his
father
would
be
when
he
showed
him
a
clear
profit
of
i
go
get
the
drafts
at
once
charlie
and
i
mighty
much
obliged
to
you
he
said
with
gratitude
in
his
voice
norton
smile
was
one
of
deep
satisfaction
that
all
right
randolph
you
know
i
want
to
do
anything
i
can
for
you
randolph
was
starting
for
his
room
when
haines
and
cullen
turned
sharply
around
the
corner
of
the
hotel
desk
again
bud
and
the
young
southerner
accidentally
collided
where
are
you
going
ca
you
look
out
blurted
langdon
haines
grinned
guess
it
your
fault
this
time
oh
it
is
is
it
irritably
replied
randolph
who
as
the
young
marse
had
been
accustomed
to
considerable
deference
on
the
plantation
well
take
that
he
angrily
cried
aiming
a
savage
swing
at
haines
the
reporter
athletic
training
proved
of
ready
service
dodging
under
the
clenched
fist
he
turned
dexterously
seized
young
outstretched
wrist
and
bent
the
arm
down
over
his
haines
shoulder
as
though
to
throw
the
young
attacker
with
the
wrestler
flying
mare
langdon
was
helpless
as
haines
had
also
secured
his
free
hand
but
instead
of
completing
the
throw
the
reporter
walked
away
with
his
foe
held
securely
on
his
back
to
put
him
to
bed
a
kindly
service
in
view
of
randolph
mental
state
from
across
the
lobby
charles
norton
had
watched
discomfiting
encounter
with
haines
with
amusement
now
that
i
got
the
young
fellow
to
sew
up
his
old
man
money
in
altacoola
land
he
chuckled
reckon
senator
william
langdon
see
anything
wrong
with
that
same
noble
tract
of
universe
when
he
comes
to
vote
for
the
naval
base
senator
stevens
will
be
pleased
chapter
iv
just
the
man
we
need
as
bud
haines
returned
from
young
langdon
room
where
he
had
left
the
latter
in
bed
with
a
towel
filled
with
cracked
ice
around
his
head
he
saw
two
familiar
figures
standing
in
a
secluded
corner
of
the
lobby
they
were
talking
earnestly
in
a
low
voice
whew
whistled
the
newspaper
man
it
must
be
something
important
that
brings
both
the
boss
of
the
senate
and
stevens
of
mississippi
here
haines
how
are
you
senator
stevens
said
cordially
as
looking
up
he
saw
the
newspaper
man
approaching
senator
peabody
you
know
haines
do
you
the
brightest
young
correspondent
in
washington
senator
peabody
of
pennsylvania
the
leading
power
in
the
upper
house
was
a
man
of
commanding
character
and
of
strong
personality
the
fact
he
used
these
attributes
to
advance
in
the
senate
the
financial
interests
of
himself
of
standard
steel
and
other
commercial
organizations
met
with
very
little
protest
in
washington
that
he
deserved
the
title
frequently
used
in
referring
to
him
boss
of
the
senate
none
would
deny
who
had
knowledge
of
the
inner
workings
of
the
senate
and
the
various
committees
senator
peabody
was
very
affable
to
the
reporters
especially
to
those
of
haines
stamp
who
had
never
accepted
any
favors
from
him
and
who
opposed
his
methods
he
aimed
to
win
the
friendship
of
these
opponents
by
diplomacy
as
he
had
found
that
reporters
of
the
haines
sort
could
not
be
influenced
by
money
he
considered
a
reporter
who
would
take
a
bribe
as
a
constructive
conservative
member
of
society
and
frequently
regretted
that
so
many
of
the
correspondents
sent
to
washington
could
not
be
bought
nor
had
bills
they
wanted
passed
or
defeated
he
extended
his
hand
to
haines
as
stevens
concluded
and
said
warmly
of
course
i
know
the
representative
of
the
how
do
you
do
haines
i
wonder
if
we
not
all
here
on
the
same
errand
suggested
the
newspaper
man
senator
peabody
appeared
to
be
all
candor
we
came
to
call
on
senator
langdon
senator
stevens
new
colleague
he
said
bud
haines
opened
his
eyes
wide
by
jove
langdon
stock
is
going
up
when
the
chairman
of
the
naval
committee
drops
in
to
welcome
him
you
see
langdon
went
in
on
a
naval
base
platform
explained
stevens
our
section
of
the
south
is
red
hot
in
favor
of
the
government
spending
its
naval
base
appropriation
right
there
certainly
interrupted
haines
but
and
there
being
a
vacancy
on
the
committee
on
naval
affairs
continued
stevens
whose
dignity
was
offended
by
the
interruption
the
friends
of
senator
langdon
are
working
to
have
him
appointed
on
that
committee
because
he
comes
from
the
state
where
the
naval
base
will
be
located
and
will
like
myself
be
more
familiar
with
the
availability
of
the
various
sites
suggested
than
a
man
from
another
state
haines
nodded
yes
of
course
what
town
going
to
get
it
senator
senator
stevens
paused
judiciously
well
he
said
altacoola
and
gulf
city
are
the
chief
candidates
i
suppose
you
had
better
talk
to
langdon
about
it
the
reporter
smiled
that
just
what
i
came
for
senator
but
i
have
to
go
up
to
the
war
department
now
when
senator
langdon
comes
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
tell
him
i
want
to
interview
him
stevens
bowed
cordially
indeed
i
shall
i
tell
him
he
in
luck
to
have
the
smartest
young
man
in
washington
on
the
job
all
right
laughed
bud
only
do
make
it
so
strong
that
he
recognize
me
when
he
sees
me
and
he
hurried
away
to
keep
a
belated
appointment
clever
boy
said
stevens
as
the
newspaper
man
disappeared
the
boss
of
the
senate
agreed
yes
only
i
not
sure
it
a
good
thing
for
a
newspaper
man
to
be
too
clever
spoils
his
usefulness
makes
him
ask
too
many
confounded
questions
stevens
acquiesced
for
it
would
never
do
to
disagree
with
the
boss
it
very
kind
of
you
senator
he
began
changing
the
subject
to
come
with
me
to
welcome
the
new
senator
from
my
state
my
old
friend
and
colleague
an
inscrutable
smile
a
smile
yet
a
cold
one
accompanied
answer
i
have
always
found
stevens
he
said
that
a
little
attention
like
this
to
a
new
man
is
never
wasted
and
i
make
it
a
rule
not
to
overlook
opportunities
again
the
senior
senator
from
mississippi
acquiesced
and
he
laughed
heartily
at
peabody
keen
insight
into
human
nature
i
think
you
like
langdon
stevens
remarked
after
a
pause
and
you
find
him
easy
to
deal
with
just
put
up
any
measure
for
the
benefit
of
the
south
and
langdon
will
go
the
limit
on
it
even
a
republican
majority
does
mind
a
little
democratic
support
you
know
i
think
he
just
the
man
you
can
use
in
this
gulf
naval
base
bill
you
can
swing
him
asked
peabody
sharply
stevens
drew
closer
to
peabody
i
elected
him
and
he
knows
it
he
chuckled
the
boss
nodded
and
it
likely
that
a
man
like
langdon
new
to
politics
a
simple
gentleman
of
the
old
school
as
you
describe
him
might
have
considerable
influence
on
opinion
throughout
the
country
langdon
colleague
grasped
the
arm
of
the
senatorial
dictator
he
just
the
man
we
want
senator
he
one
of
those
old
fellows
you
just
have
to
believe
when
he
talks
he
do
what
i
suggest
and
he
can
make
the
public
believe
what
we
think
then
you
guarantee
him
snapped
the
boss
unreservedly
senator
all
right
said
peabody
he
goes
on
the
naval
committee
that
ought
to
be
enough
honor
for
a
man
who
a
year
ago
was
growing
cotton
on
an
old
plantation
miles
away
from
civilization
we
have
control
now
of
all
the
land
about
altacoola
that
can
be
used
said
stevens
i
have
had
norton
the
congressman
from
langdon
district
working
on
it
there
is
a
foot
of
land
there
which
we
do
not
now
control
under
options
and
he
added
with
a
chuckle
the
options
were
dirt
cheap
peabody
grunted
approvingly
there
wo
be
any
new
york
fortune
in
it
but
it
ought
to
be
a
pretty
tidy
bit
he
said
now
if
we
could
only
get
langdon
interested
directly
or
indirectly
in
a
financial
way
that
would
clinch
everything
the
senior
senator
from
mississippi
shook
his
head
it
too
risky
he
you
know
has
about
as
much
idea
about
practical
politics
as
well
as
we
have
of
the
golden
rule
fact
is
he
rather
lives
by
that
antiquated
standard
that
where
we
get
him
he
owes
everything
to
me
you
see
so
naturally
he
do
anything
i
want
him
to
by
the
way
there
norton
now
perhaps
he
can
tell
us
something
call
him
over
said
peabody
norton
had
been
strolling
about
the
lobby
hoping
to
be
noticed
the
flame
had
lured
the
moth
and
it
liked
the
manner
of
the
singeing
the
congressman
hurried
precipitately
across
at
stevens
summons
i
been
wanting
to
speak
to
you
gentlemen
said
norton
full
of
the
good
trick
he
had
turned
but
i
did
like
to
interrupt
you
i
think
i
done
a
big
stroke
for
altacoola
even
peabody
pricked
up
his
ears
yes
said
both
senators
together
with
a
keen
sense
of
the
dramatic
the
congressman
let
his
next
words
drawl
out
with
full
effect
i
got
senator
langdon
interested
financially
interested
he
said
his
two
hearers
exchanged
a
significant
glance
how
asked
peabody
sharply
norton
smiled
shrewdly
well
i
just
let
his
son
invest
of
the
senator
money
in
altacoola
land
that
ought
to
help
some
stevens
stared
in
amazement
at
his
congressman
his
eyes
threatening
to
bulge
out
of
his
head
what
he
gasped
you
got
langdon
money
in
altacoola
through
his
son
i
sure
have
senator
chuckled
norton
he
in
to
the
extent
of
fifty
thousand
and
i
promised
that
the
fifty
shall
make
a
hundred
by
spring
it
make
three
hundred
thousand
at
least
snapped
peabody
norton
you
done
a
good
day
work
by
the
way
a
new
york
client
of
mine
has
a
little
business
that
i
can
not
attend
to
handily
involve
much
work
and
a
young
hustling
lawyer
like
you
ought
to
take
charge
of
it
easily
the
fee
i
should
say
would
be
about
have
you
the
time
to
undertake
it
the
congressman
drew
a
long
breath
his
eyes
beamed
with
gratitude
i
should
say
i
have
senator
of
course
it
wo
interfere
with
any
of
my
duties
as
a
congressman
peabody
smiled
of
course
not
norton
i
see
that
your
sense
of
humor
is
improving
if
convenient
run
over
to
new
york
the
last
of
the
week
i
give
you
a
card
my
client
office
is
at
broadway
the
ruler
of
the
senate
nodded
a
curt
dismissal
thank
you
senator
thank
you
very
much
and
norton
bowed
and
left
rejoicing
peabody
turned
to
stevens
you
see
even
a
congressman
can
be
useful
sometimes
remarked
stevens
dryly
keep
your
eye
on
that
young
man
stevens
he
the
most
valuable
congressman
we
had
from
your
state
in
a
long
while
does
just
what
he
is
told
and
does
ask
any
fool
questions
this
was
good
work
langdon
on
the
naval
committee
now
sure
come
stevens
let
go
to
some
quiet
corner
in
the
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
something
else
the
standard
has
on
hand
for
you
to
do
hardly
had
they
departed
from
the
lobby
when
resounding
commotion
at
the
entrance
followed
by
the
rushing
of
porters
and
bellboys
and
an
expectant
pose
on
the
part
of
the
clerk
indicated
that
the
new
senator
from
mississippi
had
arrived
chapter
v
the
boss
of
the
senate
inspects
a
new
member
an
actor
playing
the
rôle
of
a
high
type
of
southern
planter
would
score
a
decided
success
by
picturing
the
character
exactly
after
the
fashion
of
senator
william
langdon
as
he
strode
to
the
desk
of
the
international
hotel
a
black
hat
thrust
back
on
his
head
a
long
black
perfecto
in
his
mouth
coattails
spreading
out
behind
as
he
walked
and
the
big
bill
langdon
smile
on
his
face
that
carried
sunshine
and
good
will
wherever
he
went
he
was
good
to
look
on
an
inspiration
particularly
in
washington
following
the
senator
were
miss

georgia
leading
a
retinue
of
hotel
attendants
staggering
under
a
large
assortment
of
luggage
both
beautiful
girls
they
caused
a
sensation
all
of
their
own
carolina
a
different
type
from
the
younger
had
an
austere
loveliness
denoting
pride
and
birth
a
brunette
of
the
quality
that
has
contributed
so
much
to
the
fame
of
southern
women
hope
georgia
more
girlish
and
a
vivacious
blonde
was
the
especial
pet
of
her
father
and
usually
succeeded
in
doing
with
him
what
she
chose
a
real
senator
and
two
such
young
women
handsomely
gowned
seemed
to
take
the
old
hotel
back
a
score
of
years
back
to
the
times
when
such
sights
were
of
daily
occurrence
the
ancient
greatness
of
the
now
dingy
international
lived
again
how
are
you
senator
glad
to
welcome
you
sir
was
the
greeting
the
genial
senator
held
out
his
hand
everybody
was
his
friend
glad
to
meet
you
sir
glad
to
meet
you
he
exclaimed
must
make
you
acquainted
with
my
daughters
this
is
miss
carolina
langdon
this
miss
hope
georgia
langdon
the
two
girls
with
their
father
idea
of
courtesy
shook
hands
with
the
clerk
who
was
not
at
all
taken
aback
by
the
unexpected
honor
hope
georgia
was
thoroughly
delighted
with
everything
but
carolina
looked
at
the
worn
and
faded
walls
and
furnishings
with
evident
distaste
oh
this
is
washington
murmured
hope
georgia
ecstatically
clasping
her
hands
and
gazing
at
a
vista
of
artificial
palms
in
a
corridor
ah
this
is
washington
sighed
the
new
senator
contentedly
as
he
gazed
across
a
hall
at
the
biggest
and
most
gorgeous
cigar
stand
he
had
ever
seen
or
ever
hoped
to
see
the
only
new
thing
added
to
the
hotel
since
grant
was
president
truly
magnificent
establishment
you
have
here
sir
magnificent
he
exclaimed
as
an
imitation
marble
column
came
within
his
purview
i
remember
my
friend
senator
moseley
speaking
to
me
of
it
thirty
years
ago
are
our
rooms
ready
the
clerk
hugely
pleased
hastened
to
assure
him
that
everything
was
in
order
waiting
you
better
go
up
girls
while
i
look
around
a
bit
and
sort
of
get
the
hang
of
things
yes
i
think
we
had
better
look
around
a
bit
too
before
we
decide
father
said
carolina
diplomatically
her
father
patted
her
affectionately
on
the
arm
now
do
you
worry
carolina
i
see
you
think
this
place
too
expensive
from
its
looks
too
good
for
us
but
i
tell
you
the
best
even
this
is
too
good
for
you
girls
and
your
dad
run
away
and
i
come
up
and
see
you
soon
the
new
senator
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
desk
surveying
the
place
i
understand
this
is
a
favorite
haunt
for
the
big
men
of
washington
he
said
the
clerk
eagerly
agreed
yes
indeed
senator
we
have
them
all
senator
peabody
and
senator
stevens
were
here
just
a
moment
ago
boy
find
senator
peabody
and
senator
stevens
and
tell
them
senator
langdon
is
here
the
two
senators
came
quickly
i
glad
to
see
you
langdon
glad
to
see
you
exclaimed
stevens
with
an
assumption
of
effusiveness
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
senator
peabody
of
pennsylvania
peabody
bowed
and
langdon
held
out
his
hand
i
delighted
to
meet
you
senator
this
is
a
proud
day
for
me
sir
peabody
had
put
on
his
smoothest
and
most
polished
manner
i
came
especially
to
meet
you
senator
langdon
he
said
although
we
are
on
different
sides
we
may
be
interested
in
the
same
things
i
hope
we
shall
see
a
great
deal
of
each
other
langdon
chuckled
that
mighty
good
of
you
senator
i
depending
on
you
experienced
fellows
to
put
me
through
do
know
much
about
this
lawmaking
business
you
know
raising
cotton
arguing
the
government
and
bossing
niggers
have
been
about
the
extent
of
my
occupation
for
the
last
forty
years
so
i
reckon
i
not
much
of
a
practical
lawmaker
oh
you
learn
you
learn
quickly
assured
peabody
with
stevens
here
for
a
guide
you
ca
go
wrong
we
all
look
up
to
stevens
he
one
of
the
powers
on
your
side
he
an
able
man
is
stevens
the
new
senator
from
mississippi
gladly
corroborated
this
you
right
sir
a
great
man
i
tell
you
when
he
told
that
legislature
what
they
ought
to
do
senator
peabody
they
did
it
if
it
was
for
stevens
i
would
be
here
now
in
mock
protest
the
senior
senator
from
mississippi
raised
his
hands
now
now
langdon
do
say
that
your
worth
your
integrity
your
character
and
our
old
friendship
got
you
the
senatorship
the
old
planter
laughed
gleefully
sure
stevens
i
have
the
character
and
the
integrity
but
i
reckon
the
character
and
integrity
would
have
done
much
business
if
you
had
had
the
legislature
clearly
delighted
peabody
considered
it
certain
that
this
new
senator
knew
just
the
way
he
should
go
and
would
cause
no
difficulty
his
keen
sense
of
gratitude
made
him
appreciate
how
he
had
been
elected
peabody
literally
beamed
on
langdon
i
hope
we
shall
be
able
to
work
a
good
deal
together
senator
he
said
i
have
the
interests
of
the
south
at
heart
particularly
with
regard
to
this
new
naval
base
perhaps
we
may
be
able
to
get
you
on
the
naval
committee
me
laughed
langdon
well
that
would
be
going
strong
but
i
tell
you
i
for
the
naval
base
for
altacoola
suggested
stevens
langdon
hesitated
peabody
and
stevens
watched
him
as
eagles
watch
their
prey
from
the
mountain
crag
well
it
looks
to
me
like
altacoola
ought
to
be
a
fine
site
but
the
actual
place
is
so
important
to
me
i
tell
you
gentlemen
he
said
in
impressive
seriousness
that
rang
with
sturdy
american
manhood
i
tell
you
that
what
is
important
is
that
the
great
sweeping
curve
of
the
gulf
shall
hold
some
of
those
white
ships
of
ours
to
watch
over
the
indies
and
the
canal
and
to
keep
an
eye
on
south
america
and
right
there
on
our
own
southern
coast
i
want
these
ships
built
and
equipped
and
the
guns
cast
and
the
men
found
to
man
them
i
want
the
south
to
have
her
part
in
the
nation
defense
i
want
her
to
have
this
great
naval
city
as
the
living
proof
that
there
is
again
just
one
country
the
united
states
and
the
north
and
the
south
both
have
forgiven
senator
peabody
clapped
the
new
member
on
the
back
good
he
exclaimed
you
got
to
make
some
speeches
like
that
we
have
you
as
the
orator
for
the
naval
base
langdon
eyes
opened
wide
orator
he
gasped
me
an
orator
why
that
was
oratory
good
oratory
exclaimed
stevens
with
enthusiasm
huh
grunted
the
planter
you
call
that
oratory
why
that
was
only
the
truth
we
see
that
you
do
some
more
of
it
then
laughed
peabody
remember
we
count
on
you
for
the
naval
base
for
rural
simplicity
he
perfection
whispered
peabody
to
stevens
as
they
left
the
planter
he
a
living
picture
of
innocence
push
him
forward
and
let
him
do
the
talking
for
the
naval
affairs
committee
hiding
behind
him
we
could
put
through
almost
any
kind
of
a
proposition
once
more
did
the
senior
senator
from
mississippi
acquiesce
chapter
vi
new
friends
and
an
old
enemy
langdon
gazed
at
the
two
departing
senators
with
varied
emotions
he
sat
down
to
think
over
what
they
had
said
and
to
carefully
consider
what
manner
of
man
was
peabody
who
showed
such
an
interest
in
him
he
realized
that
he
would
have
considerable
intercourse
with
peabody
in
the
processes
of
legislation
and
finally
had
to
admit
to
himself
that
he
did
not
like
the
senator
from
pennsylvania
just
what
it
was
langdon
could
not
at
this
time
make
certain
but
he
was
mystified
by
traces
of
contradictions
in
the
senator
character
slight
traces
true
but
traces
nevertheless
peabody
cordiality
and
sympathy
were
to
langdon
mind
partly
genuine
and
partly
false
just
what
was
the
cause
of
or
the
necessity
for
the
alloy
in
the
true
metal
he
could
not
fathom
his
talk
with
these
famous
lawmakers
was
unsatisfactory
also
in
that
it
had
conveyed
to
langdon
the
suggestion
that
the
senate
was
not
primarily
a
great
forum
for
the
general
and
active
consideration
of
weighty
measures
and
of
national
policies
it
had
been
his
idea
that
the
senate
was
primarily
such
a
forum
but
the
attitude
of
peabody
and
stevens
had
hinted
to
him
that
there
were
matters
of
individual
interest
that
outweighed
public
or
national
considerations
for
instance
they
were
anxious
that
altacoola
should
have
the
naval
base
regardless
of
the
claims
or
merits
of
any
other
section
that
was
unusual
puzzling
to
langdon
moreover
it
was
poor
business
yet
there
were
able
business
men
in
the
senate
not
one
of
them
would
for
instance
think
of
buying
a
site
for
a
factory
until
he
had
investigated
many
possible
locations
and
then
selected
the
most
favorable
one
why
was
it
he
pondered
that
the
business
of
the
great
united
states
of
america
was
not
conducted
on
business
lines
he
must
study
the
whole
question
intelligently
that
was
imperative
he
must
have
advice
help
to
whom
was
he
to
go
for
it
stevens
yes
his
old
friend
who
knew
all
the
ropes
yet
even
stevens
seemed
different
in
washington
than
stevens
in
mississippi
here
he
played
second
fiddle
he
was
even
obsequious
langdon
had
observed
to
peabody
in
mississippi
he
was
a
leader
and
a
strong
one
too
but
senator
langdon
had
not
yet
learned
of
the
many
founts
from
which
political
strength
and
political
leadership
may
be
gained
what
he
finally
decided
on
was
the
engaging
of
a
secretary
but
he
must
be
one
with
knowledge
of
political
operations
one
who
combined
wisdom
with
honesty
such
an
aid
could
prevent
langdon
from
making
the
many
mistakes
that
invariably
mark
the
new
man
in
politics
and
he
could
point
out
the
most
effective
modes
of
procedure
under
given
circumstances
it
might
prove
difficult
to
find
a
man
of
the
necessary
qualifications
who
was
not
already
employed
but
in
the
meantime
langdon
would
watch
the
playing
of
the
game
himself
and
make
his
own
deductions
as
best
he
could
the
senator
started
toward
the
hotel
desk
to
ask
regarding
the
whereabouts
of
his
son
randolph
when
his
attention
was
caught
by
the
sight
of
three
powerful
negro
porters
endeavoring
to
thrust
outdoors
a
threadbare
old
man
the
victim
flowing
white
hair
white
mustache
and
military
bearing
received
short
shrift
come
along
colonel
yo
ca
sit
heah
all
day
them

is
for
the
guests
in
the
hotel
the
head
porter
was
urging
as
he
jerked
the
old
man
toward
the
door
the
mississippian
fighting
blood
was
instantly
aroused
at
such
treatment
of
a
respectable
old
white
man
by
negroes
his
lips
tightly
compressed
as
he
hurried
to
the
rescue
he
cried
sharply
take
your
hands
off
that
gentleman
what
do
you
mean
by
touching
a
friend
of
mine
the
negroes
stepped
back
amazed
me
senator
is
this
a
friend
of
yours
the
head
porter
gasped
apologetically
langdon
looked
at
him
you
heard
what
i
said
he
drawled
in
the
slow
way
natural
to
some
men
of
the
south
when
trouble
threatens
i
like
to
have
you
down
in
mississippi
for
about
ten
minutes
the
head
porter
turned
quickly
on
his
assistants
and
drove
them
away
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
voice
get
about
yo
wuk
how
dare
yo
intehfere
wid
a
friend
of
de
senator
i
teach
yo
to
be
putting
yoh
nose
in
where
it
ai
got
no
business
the
old
man
astonished
at
the
turn
of
events
came
forward
hesitatingly
to
langdon
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
sir
he
said
i
colonel
stoneman
an
old
soldier
the
mississippian
stretched
forth
his
hand
my
name
is
langdon
sir
senator
langdon
of
mississippi
i
am
an
old
soldier
too
delighted
senator
exclaimed
the
old
man
taking
the
offered
hand
gratefully
langdon
easy
method
of
making
friends
was
well
illustrated
as
he
clapped
his
new
companion
on
the
back
everybody
he
met
was
the
mississippian
friend
until
he
had
proved
himself
the
contrary
that
had
been
his
rule
through
life
come
right
over
colonel
have
a
cigar
sir
then
as
they
lighted
their
cigars
he
inquired
what
army
corps
were
you
with
colonel
i
was
under
grant
along
the
tennessee
replied
the
old
man
familiarity
with
a
senator
was
something
new
for
him
and
already
he
was
straightening
up
and
becoming
more
of
a
man
every
moment
langdon
was
thoroughly
interested
i
was
along
the
tennessee
under
beauregard
he
said
great
generals
sir
great
generals
exclaimed
colonel
stoneman
and
great
fighting
i
reckon
echoed
the
confederate
you
remember
the
battle
of
crawfordsville
the
old
federal
smiled
with
joyous
recollection
do
i
well
i
should
say
i
did
were
you
there
senator
was
i
there
why
i
remember
every
shot
that
was
fired
i
was
under
kirby
who
turned
your
left
wing
the
attitude
of
the
northern
soldier
changed
instantly
he
drew
himself
up
with
cold
dignity
plainly
he
felt
that
he
had
the
honor
of
his
army
to
sustain
our
left
wing
was
never
turned
sir
he
exclaimed
with
dignity
langdon
stared
at
him
with
amazement
this
was
a
point
of
view
the
confederate
had
never
heard
before
never
turned
he
gasped
do
tell
me
that
i
was
there
and
besides
i
fought
this
battle
on
an
average
of
twice
a
week
ever
since
down
in
mississippi
and
in
all
these
years
i
never
heard
such
a
foolish
statement
what
rank
were
you
sir
asked
the
union
soldier
haughtily
i
was
a
captain
that
morning
confessed
the
southerner
his
old
enemy
smiled
with
superiority
as
a
colonel
i
probably
got
more
accurate
information
he
said
i
was
a
colonel
that
evening
came
the
dry
retort
but
in
an
inferior
army
we
licked
you
sir
cried
stoneman
hotly
the
mississippian
drew
himself
up
with
all
the
dignity
common
to
the
old
confederate
soldier
explaining
the
war
the
south
was
never
whipped
sir
we
honorably
surrendered
sir
we
surrendered
to
save
the
country
sir
but
we
were
never
whipped
did
you
not
run
at
kenyon
hill
taunted
stoneman
langdon
brought
down
his
fist
in
the
palm
of
the
other
hand
violently
yes
sir
we
ran
at
you
i
ought
to
remember
i
got
my
wound
there
you
remember
that
long
lane
he
pulled
off
his
hat
and
threw
it
on
the
floor
indicating
it
with
one
hand
here
was
the
second
alabama
the
hat
of
the
old
federal
dropped
on
the
floor
opposite
the
hat
of
the
confederate
and
here
the
eighth
illinois
exclaimed
stoneman
langdon
excitedly
seized
a
diminutive
bellboy
passing
by
and
planted
him
alongside
his
hat
stay
there
a
moment
sonny
he
cried
you
are
the
fourth
virginia
the
newspaper
stoneman
was
carrying
came
down
opposite
the
startled
bellboy
who
was
trying
not
to
appear
frightened
this
is
the
clump
of
cedars
he
exclaimed
both
in
their
eagerness
were
bending
down
over
their
improvised
battle
plan
their
heads
close
together
and
here
a
farmhouse
beside
your
cedars
cried
langdon
that
where
the
rebels
charged
us
echoed
the
union
man
langdon
brought
down
his
fist
again
with
emphatic
gesture
you
bet
we
charged
you
the
third
mississippi
charged
you
i
charged
you
sir
stoneman
nodded
i
remember
a
young
fool
of
a
johnnie
reb
dashing
up
the
hill
fifty
yards
ahead
of
his
men
waving
his
sword
and
yelling
like
a
wild
indian
the
southerner
straightened
up
well
where
in
thunderation
would
you
expect
me
to
be
sir
he
exclaimed
behind
them
i
got
my
wound
there
laid
me
up
for
three
months
like
to
have
killed
me
then
a
new
idea
struck
him
why
colonel
it
must
have
been
a
bullet
from
one
of
your
men
from
your
regiment
sir
the
old
northerner
pushed
his
fingers
through
his
hair
and
shook
his
head
apologetically
why
senator
i
afraid
it
was
he
hesitated
langdon
eyes
were
big
with
the
afterglow
of
a
fighter
discussing
the
mighty
struggles
of
the
past
those
most
precious
of
all
the
jewels
in
the
treasure
store
of
a
soldier
memory
why
it
might
have
been
a
bullet
fired
by
you
sir
he
cried
it
might
be
that
you
were
the
man
who
almost
killed
me
why
confound
you
sir
i
glad
to
meet
you
each
old
veteran
of
tragic
days
gone
by
had
quite
unconsciously
awakened
a
responsive
chord
in
the
heart
of
the
other
a
senator
and
a
penniless
old
down
and
outer
are
very
much
the
same
in
the
human
scale
that
takes
note
of
the
inside
and
not
the
outside
of
a
man
and
they
fell
into
each
other
arms
then
and
there
for
what
strong
fighter
does
not
respect
another
of
his
kind
there
they
stood
arms
around
each
other
clapping
each
other
on
the
back
actually
chortling
in
the
pure
ecstasy
of
comradeship
now
serious
again
laughing
when
on
the
scene
appeared
bud
haines
the
correspondent
who
had
returned
to
interview
the
new
senator
from
mississippi
great
heavens
ejaculated
the
newspaper
man
a
senator
a
united
states
senator
hugging
a
old
what
is
the
world
coming
to
haines
suddenly
paused
i
wonder
if
it
can
be
a
pose
merely
for
effect
it
getting
harder
every
day
to
tell
genuine
and
what
is
in
this
town
chapter
vii
langdon
learns
of
things
unpleasant

quickly
walked
over
and
touched
the
southerner
on
the
arm
well

boy

do
for
you
asked
the
new
senator

with
a
pleasant
smile

stevens
was
to
speak
to
you
about
me
the
first
of
the
newspaper
correspondents

to
interview
you
langdon
familiar
smile
broadened
well
you
do
look
as
though
you
bite
reckon
i
can
stand
for
it
is
it
very
painful
i
hope
it
wo
be
senator
haines
said
feeling
instinctively
that
he
was
going
to
like
this
big
hearty
citizen
all
right
haines
just
as
soon
as
i
said
to
my
old
friend
colonel
stoneman
i
be
with
you
and
to
his
continued
amazement
haines
saw
the
senator
walk
away
with
the
old
union
colonel
slap
him
on
the
back
cheer
him
up
and
finally
bid
him
after
extending
a
cordial
invitation
to
come
around
to
dinner
meet
his
daughters
and
talk
over
old
times
the
antiquated
federal
soldier
marched
away
more
erect
more
brisk
than
in
years
completely
restored
to
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
hotel
people
langdon
turned
to
the
reporter
all
right
haines
my
hands
are
up
do
your
worst
senator
stevens
spoke
to
me
about
you
said
you
were
the
smartest
young
newspaper
man
in
washington
you
must
come
from
the
south
bud
shook
his
head
no
just
new
york
he
said
well
that
a
promising
town
drawled
the
southerner
they
tell
me
that
the
vicksburg
of
the
north
i
suppose
you
have
been
to
new
york
of
late
senator
suggested
the
newspaper
man
well
i
started
up
there
with
general
lee
once
responded
langdon
reminiscently
but
we
changed
our
minds
and
came
back
you
may
have
heard
about
that
trip
haines
admitted
that
he
had
since
that
time
went
on
langdon
i
confined
my
travels
to
new
orleans
and
vicksburg
ever
been
in
new
orleans
about
mardi
gras
time
mr
haines
sorry
but
i
do
believe
i
have
confessed
the
reporter
reluctantly
the
senator
seemed
surprised
well
sir
you
have
something
to
live
for
i
make
it
my
special
business
to
personally
conduct
you
through
one
mardi
gras
with
a
special
understanding
of
course
that
you
do
print
anything
in
the
paper
i
a
vestryman
in
my
church
but
since
misfortune
has
come
upon
our
state
i
have
to
be
careful
haines
searched
his
brain
he
knew
of
no
grave
calamity
that
had
happened
recently
in
mississippi
misfortune
he
questioned
senator
langdon
nodded
illustration
from
new
york
eh
the
vicksburg
of
the
north
yes
sir
the
great
old
state
of
mississippi
went
prohibition
at
the
last
election
i
do
know
how
it
happened
we
have
found
anybody
in
the
state
that
says
he
voted
for
it
but
the
fact
is
a
fact
i
assure
you
haines
that
prohibition
stops
at
my
front
door
in
mississippi
so
i
been
living
a
quiet
life
down
on
my
plantation
this
new
life
will
be
a
great
change
for
you
then
suggested
the
reporter
change
it
revolutionary
sir
when
you
expected
to
spend
your
old
days
peacefully
in
the
country
haines
suddenly
to
find
that
your
state
has
called
on
you
a
flavor
of
sarcasm
came
into
haines
reply
the
office
seeking
the
man
he
could
not
help
the
slight
sneer
was
a
man
never
to
admit
that
he
had
sought
the
office
haines
knew
only
too
well
of
the
arduous
work
necessary
to
secure
nominations
for
high
office
in
conventions
and
to
win
an
election
to
the
senate
from
a
state
legislature
in
almost
every
case
he
knew
the
candidate
must
make
a
dozen
different
deals
to
secure
votes
might
promise
the
same
office
to
two
or
three
different
leaders
force
others
into
line
by
threats
send
a
trusted
agent
to
another
with
a
roll
of
bank
bills
the
recipient
of
which
would
immediately
conclude
that
this
candidate
was
the
only
man
in
the
state
who
could
save
the
nation
from
destruction
had
not
haines
seen
men
who
had
sold
their
unsuspecting
delegates
for
cash
to
the
highest
bidder
rise
in
the
convention
hall
and
in
impassioned
dramatic
voice
exclaim
in
praise
of
the
buyer
gentlemen
it
would
be
a
crying
shame
a
crime
against
civilization
if
the
chosen
representatives
of
our
grand
old
state
of
did
not
go
on
record
in
favor
of
such
a
man
such
a
true
citizen
such
an
inspired
patriot
as
he
whose
name
i
am
about
to
mention
so
the
reporter
may
be
forgiven
for
the
ironical
tinge
in
his
hasty
interruption
of
the
new
senator
remarks
langdon
could
not
suppress
a
chuckle
at
the
doubting
note
in
attitude
i
think
the
man
would
be
pretty
small
potatoes
who
would
seek
the
office
of
united
states
senator
haines
he
said
if
he
could
get
it
when
i
was
a
young
man
sir
politics
in
the
south
was
a
career
for
a
gentleman
and
i
still
ca
see
how
he
could
be
better
engaged
than
in
the
service
of
his
state
or
his
country
that
right
agreed
the
reporter
further
impressed
by
the
frank
sincerity
of
the
mississippian
the
only
condition
in
my
mind
haines
is
that
the
man
should
ask
himself
searchingly
whether
or
not
he
competent
to
give
the
service
but
i
seem
to
be
talking
a
good
deal
suppose
we
get
to
the
interview
expect
your
time
is
short
we
better
begin
i
thought
we
were
in
the
interview
smiled
the
correspondent
in
it
exclaimed
langdon
well
if
this
is
it
it
is
so
bad
i
see
you
use
a
painless
method
when
i
was
down
in
vicksburg
a
reporter
backed
me
up
in
a
corner
slipped
his
hand
in
his
hip
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
list
of
questions
just
three
feet
four
inches
long
he
wanted
to
know
what
i
thought
concerning
the
tariff
on
aluminium
hydrates
and
how
i
stood
about
the
opening
of
the
tento
pu
reservation
of
the
comanche
indians
and
what
were
my
ideas
about
the
differential
rate
of
hauls
from
the
missouri
river
he
was
a
wonder
that
fellow
kinder
out
of
place
on
a
mississippi
paper
i
started
to
offer
him
a
job
but
he
was
so
proud
i
was
afraid
he
would
accept
it
however
it
gives
you
my
idea
of
a
reporter
if
you
been
against
that
i
ought
to
thank
you
for
talking
to
me
laughed
haines
then
you
do
want
to
know
anything
about
that
sort
of
stuff
said
langdon
with
a
huge
sigh
of
relief
no
senator
was
the
amused
reply
i
think
generally
if
i
know
what
sort
of
a
man
a
man
is
i
can
tell
a
great
deal
about
what
he
will
think
on
various
questions
langdon
started
interestedly
you
mean
haines
if
you
know
whether
i
honest
or
not
you
can
fit
me
up
with
a
set
of
views
is
that
the
idea
seems
to
me
the
sort
of
man
i
looking
for
the
other
smilingly
shook
his
head
i
would
dare
fix
up
a
united
states
senator
with
a
set
of
views
he
said
i
only
mean
that
i
think
what
a
man
is
is
important
been
doing
washington
for
a
number
of
years
i
had
an
exceptional
opportunity
to
see
how
politics
work
i
do
believe
in
party
politics
i
do
believe
in
parties
but
i
do
believe
in
men
langdon
nodded
approvingly
then
a
twinkle
shone
in
his
eyes
we
do
believe
in
parties
in
mississippi
he
drawled
we
only
one
the
democratic
party
and
a
few
kickers
haines
grinned
broadly
at
this
description
of
southern
politics
what
was
this
you
were
saying
about
national
politics
continued
the
mississippian
i
a
beginner
you
know
and
i
always
ready
to
learn
this
is
a
new
thing
a
reporter
teaching
a
senator
politics
laughed
haines
senator
langdon
joined
in
the
merriment
i
reckon
reporters
could
teach
united
states
senators
lots
of
things
haines
if
the
senators
had
sense
enough
to
go
to
school
now
i
come
up
here
on
a
platform
the
chief
principle
of
which
is
the
naval
base
for
the
gulf
now
how
are
we
going
to
put
that
through
my
state
wants
it
you
probably
sure
it
will
be
a
wonderful
thing
for
the
country
and
the
south
suggested
haines
of
course
but
why
do
you
think
most
of
the
congressmen
and
senators
will
vote
for
it
the
southerner
took
off
his
hat
leaned
back
and
gazed
across
the
lobby
thoughtfully
seems
to
me
the
benefit
to
the
south
and
country
would
be
sufficient
reason
haines
he
finally
replied
the
newspaper
man
brain
worked
rapidly
going
over
the
entire
conversation
with
langdon
and
what
he
had
seen
of
him
he
was
certain
that
the
mississippian
believed
what
he
said
that
moreover
the
belief
was
deeply
rooted
his
long
newspaper
training
had
educated
haines
in
the
ways
of
men
their
actions
and
mental
processes
what
naturally
to
expect
from
a
given
set
of
circumstances
he
felt
a
growing
regard
an
affection
for
this
unassuming
old
man
before
him
who
did
not
know
and
probably
would
be
slow
to
understand
the
hypocrisy
the
cunning
trickery
of
lawmakers
who
unmake
laws
sufficient
reason
for
you
senator
haines
added
you
have
not
been
in
politics
very
long
have
you
he
queried
dryly
a
wry
smile
wrinkled
the
mississippian
face
been
in
long
enough
to
learn
some
unpleasant
things
i
did
know
before
he
remembered
martin
sanders
will
you
allow
me
to
tell
you
a
few
more
asked
haines
langdon
inclined
his
head
in
acquiescence
reckon
i
better
know
the
worst
and
get
through
with
it
well
then
senator
somebody
from
nebraska
will
vote
for
what
you
want
in
the
way
of
the
naval
base
because
he
think
then
you
help
him
demand
money
to
dredge
some
muddy
creek
that
he
has
an
interest
in
somebody
in
pennsylvania
will
vote
for
it
because
he
owes
a
grudge
and
wants
to
hurt
the
philadelphia
ship
people
you
get
the
democrats
because
it
for
the
south
but
if
your
bill
was
for
the
west
coast
they
might
fight
it
tooth
and
nail
even
with
the
japanese
fleet
cruising
dangerously
near
and
the
republicans
may
vote
for
it
because
they
see
a
chance
to
claim
glory
and
perhaps
break
the
solid
south
in
the
next
presidential
campaign
you
catch
the
idea
what
exclaimed
the
astounded
langdon
well
who
in
hades
will
vote
for
it
because
it
for
the
good
of
the
united
states
he
gasped
i
believe
you
will
senator
replied
haines
with
ready
confidence
chapter
viii
how
senator
langdon
gets
a
secretary
langdon
leaned
over
and
seized
the
arm
of
his
interviewer
see
here
young
man
why
are
you
in
politics
he
said
too
busy
senator
replied
haines
besides
i
like
the
newspaper
game
game
queried
langdon
oh
i
use
the
word
in
a
general
sense
senator
replied
haines
pretty
much
everything
is
a
society
politics
newspaper
work
business
of
every
sort
men
and
women
make
to
meet
the
moves
of
other
men
and
women
why
even
in
religion
the
way
some
people
play
a
the
speaker
was
interrupted
by
the
appearance
of
hope
georgia
who
was
searching
for
her
father
stay
here
and
listen
to
what
a
hard
task
your
old
father
has
got
said
the
mississippian
to
his
daughter
whom
he
presented
to
haines
with
a
picturesque
flourish
reminiscent
of
the
pride
and
chivalry
of
the
old
south
he
has
the
idea
that
those
new
yorkers
who
read
his
paper
would
actually
like
to
know
something
about
me
hope
georgia
stole
many
glances
at
the
reporter
as
he
talked
with
her
father
he
made
a
deep
impression
on
her
young
mind
she
had
spent
almost
all
her
life
on
the
plantation
her
father
providing
her
with
a
private
tutor
instead
of
sending
her
to
where
her
elder
sister
had
been
educated
owing
to
the
death
of
her
mother
the
planter
had
desired
to
keep
hope
georgia
at
home
for
companionship
this
young
man
who
was
taking
so
big
and
so
active
a
part
of
the
world
work
brought
to
her
the
atmosphere
that
her
spirit
craved
he
gave
one
an
impression
of
ability
of
earnestness
of
sincerity
and
she
was
glad
that
her
father
approved
of
him
hope
georgia
by
the
same
token
did
not
escape
the
attention
of
the
interviewer
her
appealing
charm
of
face
and
figure
was
accentuated
by
her
daintiness
and
a
fleeting
suggestion
of
naïveté
in
poise
and
expression
when
she
was
amused
his
first
glance
revealed
to
haines
that
her
eyes
were
gray
the
gray
that
people
say
indicates
the
possessor
to
have
those
priceless
qualities
the
qualities
that
make
the
sweetest
women
true
that
make
the
maiden
eyes
in
truth
the
windows
of
her
soul
the
qualities
that
make
women
womanly
she
sat
close
to
her
father
her
hand
in
his
listening
intently
to
the
unfolding
of
a
story
of
what
to
her
was
a
mysterious
world
the
man
world
the
strong
man
world
which
many
a
woman
would
give
her
all
to
enter
and
play
a
part
therein
what
else
have
you
against
a
political
career
mr
haines
went
on
the
senator
taking
up
their
conversation
well
my
age
for
one
thing
i
have
any
gray
hairs
langdon
waved
this
objection
aside
i
might
arrange
to
pool
ages
with
you
sometimes
i
think
we
want
young
men
in
politics
like
you
the
reporter
shook
his
head
old
in
age
and
young
in
politics
like
you
senator
langdon
he
replied
politics
i
sometimes
think
is
pure
hypocrisy
and
sometimes
something
worse
a
man
gets
disgusted
with
the
trickery
and
dishonesty
and
corruption
then
drawled
langdon
the
thing
to
do
is
to
jump
in
and
stop
it
i
read
in
the
newspapers
a
great
deal
about
corruption
the
gentlemen
in
national
politics
whom
i
have
had
the
honor
of
knowing
senator
moseley
an
intimate
friend
of
thirty
years
my
present
colleague
senator
stevens
and
others
have
been
as
honest
as
the
day
is
long
but
the
days
do
get
short
in
november
when
congress
meets
they
laughed
haines
rising
i
afraid
i
taken
too
much
of
your
time
and
i
seem
to
have
talked
a
lot
langdon
was
amused
does
look
like
i
been
interviewing
you
i
reckon
each
one
of
us
has
got
a
pretty
good
notion
of
what
the
other
man
like
i
wanted
it
that
way
and
i
like
you
haines
i
got
a
proposition
to
make
to
you
they
tell
me
i
need
a
secretary
now
i
think
i
need
just
such
a
young
man
as
you
i
do
know
just
exactly
what
the
work
would
be
or
what
the
financial
arrangements
should
be
but
i
think
you
and
i
would
make
a
pretty
good
team
i
wish
you
come
he
turned
to
his
daughter
with
a
smile
what
do
you
think
of
that
hope
georgia
is
your
dad
right
smiling
her
approval
the
young
girl
squeezed
her
father
hand
in
her
enthusiasm
i
think
it
a
splendid
idea
dad
just
great
wo
you
come
haines
we
eh
i
i
know
my
father
would
like
to
have
you
as
he
stood
before
his
two
friends
for
such
haines
now
considered
the
mississippian
and
his
daughter
he
could
not
suppress
feelings
of
surprise
tinged
with
uncertainty
he
had
like
other
newspaper
men
received
offers
of
employment
from
politicians
who
desired
to
increase
their
influence
with
the
press
sometimes
the
salary
offered
had
been
large
the
work
so
light
that
the
reporter
could
earn
the
money
and
yet
retain
his
newspaper
position
a
scantily
disguised
species
of
bribery
which
had
wrecked
the
careers
of
several
promising
reporters
well
known
to
haines
young
men
who
had
been
thus
led
into
selling
their
columns
by
unscrupulous
machine
dictators
haines
knew
that
the
mississippian
had
no
ulterior
purpose
to
serve
in
his
offer
yet
he
must
have
time
to
think
over
the
proposal
i
thank
you
senator
he
finally
said
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
coming
from
you
but
i
never
thought
of
giving
up
the
newspaper
profession
it
a
fascinating
career
one
that
i
am
too
fond
of
to
leave
langdon
started
to
reply
when
a
delightfully
modulated
southern
voice
interrupted
father
i
been
out
with
spangler
to
look
for
some
other
rooms
i
do
like
this
hotel
and
i
found
some
that
i
do
like
haines
turned
to
see
a
handsomely
gowned
young
woman
who
had
the
stamp
of
a
patrician
daughter
in
her
bearing
and
her
countenance
a
brunette
with
delicate
features
though
determination
shone
in
her
eyes
and
appeared
in
the
poise
of
her
head
she
was
the
imperious
type
of
beauty
and
suggested
to
haines
the
dry
point
etchings
of
paul
helleu
he
instinctively
conceived
her
to
be
intensely
ambitious
and
of
this
haines
was
soon
to
have
unexpected
evidence
gazing
at
her
with
a
sense
of
growing
admiration
haines
gave
an
involuntary
start
as
senator
langdon
spoke
my
daughter
miss
carolina
langdon
haines
said
the
senator
carolina
was
interested
are
you
the
newspaper
man
who
is
interviewing
father
i
hope
do
a
nice
one
we
want
him
to
be
a
successful
and
popular
senator
we
like
to
help
him
if
we
could
the
correspondent
bowed
i
should
say
you
certainly
would
help
him
to
be
a
popular
senator
he
declared
emphatically
failing
to
notice
that
hope
georgia
was
somewhat
annoyed
at
the
enthusiasm
displayed
over
her
elder
sister
in
fact
hope
georgia
was
suffering
a
partial
if
not
total
eclipse
i
leaving
it
to
haines
to
put
down
the
things
i
ought
to
say
broke
in
the
senator
he
knows
yes
he
knows
everything
about
washington
carolina
exclaimed
hope
georgia
spiritedly
the
older
girl
spoke
eagerly
i
wish
you
interview
me
haines
ask
me
how
i
like
washington
i
feel
as
though
i
must
tell
some
one
just
how
much
i
do
like
it
it
is
too
wonderful
i
like
mighty
well
to
interview
you
miss
langdon
enthusiastically
exclaimed
haines
i
hope
you
will
some
time
haines
remarked
carolina
as
she
said
watching
her
as
she
turned
away
haines
saw
her
extend
a
warm
greeting
to
congressman
charles
norton
who
had
advanced
toward
the
group
illustration
strange
how
the
langdons
treat
him
as
a
friend
strange
how
the
langdons
treat
him
as
a
friend
intimate
one
too
he
thought
what
if
they
should
learn
of
norton
questionable
operations
at
the
capitol
of
his
connection
with
two
unsavory
one
of
which
resulted
in
an
amendment
to
the
pure
food
law
so
that
manufacturers
of
a
valueless
cure
could
continue
to
mislead
the
victims
of
the
plague
norton
who
had
uttered
an
epigram
now
celebrated
in
the
of
washington
paths
of
glory
lead
but
to
the
graft
miss
langdon
is
very
beautiful
and
attractive
sir
said
haines
resuming
with
the
senator
yes
drawled
the
mississippian
girls
in
the
south
generally
are
well
i
must
be
going
i
think
about
your
secretaryship
senator
langdon
perhaps
i
can
find
some
one
wish
you
think
about
it
for
yourself
observed
the
senator
while
hope
georgia
again
nodded
approval
it
would
be
a
hard
job
there
are
so
many
matters
of
political
detail
about
which
i
am
sadly
inexperienced
that
really
most
of
the
work
would
fall
on
the
secretary
bud
haines
paused
again
he
thought
over
langdon
offer
its
genuineness
appealed
to
him
suddenly
there
dawned
on
him
an
idea
of
just
what
it
might
mean
to
be
associated
with
this
honest
old
citizen
who
had
asked
for
his
help
who
needed
it
as
haines
knew
only
too
well
he
would
be
the
senator
guide
and
confidant
his
adviser
in
big
matters
why
he
would
practically
be
united
states
senator
himself
he
knew
the
inside
as
few
others
in
washington
here
was
a
chance
to
match
his
wit
against
that
of
peabody
the
boss
of
the
senate
a
chance
to
spoil
some
of
the
dishonest
schemes
of
those
who
were
adroitly
playing
the
game
he
could
bother
too
the
intriguing
members
of
the
third
house
as
the
lobbyists
are
called
he
could
direct
a
lightning
bolt
into
the
camp
of
andy
corrigan
who
claimed
the
honor
of
being
speaker
of
the
third
house
these
thoughts
crowded
into
his
mind
then
too
he
would
become
practically
a
member
of
the
langdon
family
and
have
association
with
the
two
charming
daughters
with
carolina
langdon
it
would
be
a
great
chance
he
murmured
half
aloud
next
thing
to
being
a
senator
the
old
mississippian
heard
the
young
man
words
i
reckon
it
would
he
drawled
in
agreement
you
feel
sure
you
want
me
urged
the
other
langdon
chuckled
i
asked
you
he
said
haines
came
abruptly
to
decision
i
thought
it
over
senator
and
it
seems
to
me
it
will
be
a
great
chance
in
every
way
i
accept
we
fix
it
up
and
try
to
make
you
a
good
secretary
langdon
held
forth
his
hand
and
i
try
to
make
you
a
good
senator
my
boy
fix
up
nothing
your
duties
begin
you
are
to
come
to
dinner
with
me
and
my
daughters
chapter
ix
a
new
kind
of
political
partnership
the
combination
of
the
forces
of
langdon
and
haines
did
not
find
much
favor
among
the
powers
that
are
at
the
capitol
senator
peabody
peremptorily
demanded
an
explanation
from
stevens
as
to
how
he
had
allowed
his
senator
to
engage
as
his
secretary
this
inquisitive
man
haines
a
reporter
who
did
know
his
place
here
we
put
langdon
on
naval
affairs
because
we
knew
he
understand
what
going
on
and
you
stevens
supposed
to
be
the
finished
product
of
the
political
mill
fall
asleep
and
let
him
take
up
a
man
whom
nobody
can
control
one
who
knows
the
inside
workings
of
washington
and
who
will
take
pleasure
in
teaching
your
fellow
mississippian
far
too
much
for
our
good
stevens
reply
to
effect
that
probably
haines
would
consent
to
be
taken
care
of
if
judiciously
approached
was
derided
by
the
observant
peabody
a
young
reformer
grows
fat
on
notoriety
he
laughed
and
think
what
a
scandal
he
would
have
for
his
newspaper
if
we
took
a
chance
on
disclosing
our
hand
to
him
no
no
stevens
we
must
have
him
watched
and
try
to
discredit
him
in
some
way
perhaps
we
can
make
langdon
believe
that
his
secretary
is
dishonest
congressman
norton
was
another
man
who
was
dismayed
at
the
formation
of
the
firm
of
langdon
and
haines
young
randolph
too
could
not
forget
the
defeat
and
humiliation
he
had
previously
suffered
at
haines
hands
and
grew
more
bitter
as
the
reporter
influence
over
his
father
grew
stronger
but
haines
most
effective
enemy
had
arisen
in
the
person
he
would
be
the
last
to
suspect
one
whom
he
unceasingly
admired
one
whose
very
words
he
had
come
to
cherish
and
possibly
it
was
not
all
her
own
fault
that
carolina
langdon
had
enlisted
her
services
subtle
and
quite
overwhelming
owing
to
haines
fervent
worship
of
her
against
the
secretary
perhaps
the
social
system
of
which
she
had
become
a
part
in
washington
had
something
to
do
with
the
craving
to
become
a
leader
in
that
fascinating
world
whose
dazzling
variety
and
infinite
diversion
seemed
to
fill
her
soul
with
all
that
it
yearned
for
love
she
had
for
she
had
now
promised
to
wed
congressman
norton
she
loved
him
fondly
she
had
confessed
to
him
and
gradually
she
came
to
work
desperately
against
haines
who
she
had
been
convinced
by
norton
and
randolph
would
prove
a
to
them
to
her
father
to
herself
in
her
career
at
the
capital
if
his
influence
over
the
senator
should
be
permitted
to
exist
or
to
increase
and
so
on
the
surface
carolina
langdon
was
most
amiable
to
the
secretary
encouraged
him
in
his
attentions
to
her
led
him
surely
into
her
power
norton
having
prevailed
on
her
to
keep
the
knowledge
of
their
engagement
secret
from
every
one
even
her
father
the
days
and
nights
became
filled
with
important
work
for
senator
langdon
and
his
secretary
together
they
went
over
the
important
measures
outlined
what
appeared
to
be
the
best
course
of
procedure
and
carried
it
into
effect
as
far
as
possible
langdon
became
a
prominent
figure
in
the
senate
owing
to
his
consistent
support
of
measures
that
fitted
in
with
the
public
policy
or
what
should
be
the
public
policy
of
the
nation
he
had
learned
that
the
only
practicable
way
to
outwit
or
to
cope
with
the
members
of
the
dominating
machine
made
up
he
was
surprised
to
see
of
members
of
both
the
parties
the
only
two
in
washington
was
to
oppose
what
the
machine
wanted
with
enough
power
to
force
it
to
grant
him
what
he
believed
the
public
ought
to
have
he
was
described
by
some
of
the
insiders
on
capitol
hill
as
the
only
brainy
man
who
had
fought
the
machine
in
thirty
years
at
the
home
he
had
later
established
in
washington
as
preferable
to
the
international
hotel
were
frequently
seen
a
small
coterie
of
senators
and
congressmen
who
had
become
known
to
the
sarcastic
party
bosses
in
both
houses
of
congress
as
the
langdon
crowd
which
crowd
was
admitted
to
be
somewhat
a
factor
when
it
finally
prevailed
on
the
president
to
take
over
postmasters
from
the
appointment
class
and
put
them
under
the
control
of
the
civil
service
commission
resulting
in
the
necessity
of
a
competitive
examination
for
these
postmasters
instead
of
their
securing
positions
through
political
favoritism
those
who
did
not
know
langdon
intimately
suggested
that
this
fellow
ought
to
be
care
of
what
in
god
name
does
he
want
a
committee
chairmanship
an
ambassadorship
for
some
mississippi
charcoal
burner
a
couple
of
federal
judgeships
for
his
friends
well
whatever
it
is
give
it
to
him
and
get
him
in
with
the
rest
of
us
again
it
was
peabody
who
had
the
deciding
say
there
only
one
thing
worse
than
a
young
reformer
and
that
an
old
one
he
laughed
bitterly
at
a
secret
conclave
at
his
apartment
in
the
luxurious
louis
napoleon
hotel
the
young
one
thinks
he
is
going
to
live
and
wants
our
future
profits
for
himself
the
old
one
thinks
going
to
die
and
he
sore
at
leaving
so
much
graft
behind
him
heads
and
hearts
thinking
and
throbbing
together
langdon
and
his
secretary
had
learned
to
lean
on
each
other
the
young
gaining
inspiration
from
the
old
the
old
gaining
strength
from
the
young
they
loved
each
other
and
more
than
any
love
they
trusted
one
another
and
hope
georgia
watched
it
all
and
rejoiced
for
she
believed
with
all
the
accrued
erudition
of
eighteen
years
of
innocent
girlhood
that
mr
bud
haines
was
quite
the
finest
specimen
of
young
manhood
this
world
had
ever
produced
how
could
he
have
happened
she
was
sure
that
she
had
never
met
his
equal
not
even
in
that
memorable
week
she
had
spent
in
jackson
the
passing
weeks
taught
haines
that
he
was
deeply
in
love
with
carolina
and
though
he
had
endeavored
to
keep
the
knowledge
of
this
from
her
her
woman
intuition
had
told
her
his
secret
and
she
stifled
the
momentary
regrets
that
flitted
into
her
mind
because
she
was
now
in
the
game
herself
the
washington
game
that
ensnares
the
woman
as
well
as
the
man
and
makes
her
a
slave
to
its
fancy
no
one
but
herself
and
norton
knew
how
deeply
she
had
plunged
on
a
certain
possible
turn
of
the
political
cards
she
must
not
she
could
not
lose
if
life
itself
were
to
remain
of
value
to
her
and
on
her
sway
over
this
secretary
she
was
told
it
all
depended
a
subject
that
for
some
unexplained
reason
frequently
lodged
in
haines
mind
was
that
of
the
apparent
assiduity
with
which
spangler
cultivated
senator
langdon
friendship
for
several
years
she
had
occupied
a
high
social
position
at
the
capital
he
well
knew
but
various
indefinite
intangible
rumors
he
had
heard
he
could
not
state
exactly
where
had
made
him
regret
her
growing
intimacy
with
the
girls
and
with
the
senator
they
had
met
her
through
letters
of
introduction
of
the
most
trustworthy
and
assuring
character
from
people
of
highest
social
rank
in
virginia
where
the
langdons
had
many
friends
but
even
so
haines
realized
people
who
write
introductory
letters
are
sometimes
thoughtless
in
considering
all
the
circumstances
of
the
parties
they
introduce
and
residents
of
virginia
who
had
not
been
in
the
capital
for
years
might
be
forgiven
for
not
knowing
of
all
the
more
recent
developments
in
the
lives
of
those
they
knew
in
washington
while
not
wishing
to
have
the
senator
know
of
his
intention
the
secretary
determined
to
investigate
spangler
and
her
present
mode
of
life
at
his
first
opportunity
hoping
the
while
that
his
quest
would
reveal
her
to
be
what
the
langdons
considered
her
a
widow
of
wealth
fashion
and
reserve
who
resided
at
the
capital
because
the
memories
of
her
late
husband
a
former
congressman
of
high
standing
were
associated
with
it
calling
at
the
langdons
house
one
evening
in
february
to
receive
directions
regarding
important
work
for
the
next
day
haines
was
somewhat
puzzled
at
the
peculiar
smile
on
the
senator
face
answering
the
secretary
look
of
inquiry
the
mississippian
said
i
been
told
that
i
can
name
the
new
holder
of
a
position
in
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
and
that
if
i
have
no
one
in
particular
from
my
state
to
name
that
that
you
would
be
a
good
man
for
the
job
first
i
was
glad
for
your
sake
my
boy
for
if
you
wanted
it
you
could
have
the
position
but
on
thinking
it
over
it
seemed
there
might
be
something
behind
it
not
showing
on
the
surface
it
a
trick
said
haines
who
made
the
offer
senator
stevens
i
might
have
known
hotly
responded
the
secretary
there
a
crowd
that
wants
you
and
me
separated
thought
this
bait
too
much
for
me
to
resist
did
they
then
he
paused
rubbing
his
fingers
through
his
hair
in
a
perplexed
manner
strange
is
it
senator
that
a
man
of
your
party
is
offered
this
desirable
piece
of
patronage
entirely
unsolicited
on
your
part
from
the
administration
of
another
a
different
political
party
especially
when
that
other
party
has
so
many
hungry
eaters
clamoring
to
enter
the
of
milk
and
honey
i
think
stevens
deliberately
there
there
bud
broke
in
langdon
you
must
say
anything
against
senator
stevens
to
me
true
he
associates
with
some
folks
i
do
approve
of
but
that
does
necessarily
mean
anything
wrong
and
i
myself
have
always
found
him
thoroughly
honest
yes
muttered
the
secretary
following
the
senator
into
the
library
you
always
found
him
honest
because
you
think
honest
but
stevens
is
just
the
doctor
who
will
cure
you
of
this
ailment
this
chronic
trustfulness
haines
laughed
softly
when
peabody
little
stevie
gets
through
hacking
at
the
prostrate
body
of
political
purity
his
sword
of
political
corruption
will
need
new
edges
thus
far
neither
the
senator
nor
his
secretary
had
suspicion
of
any
questionable
deal
in
regard
to
the
gulf
naval
base
the
rush
of
other
events
particularly
the
fight
over
the
reduction
of
the
tariff
had
pushed
this
project
temporarily
into
the
background
so
far
as
they
were
concerned
though
the
boss
of
the
senate
and
his
satellites
had
been
losing
no
time
in
perfecting
their
plans
regarding
the
choice
of
altacoola
as
the
site
peabody
and
stevens
had
ingeniously
exploited
langdon
at
every
possible
opportunity
in
relation
to
the
naval
base
asked
about
new
developments
in
the
committee
on
naval
affairs
the
ready
answer
was
better
see
senator
langdon
he
knows
all
about
the
naval
base
has
the
matter
in
full
charge
i
really
know
little
about
it
so
by
hiding
behind
the
unsuspecting
old
hero
of
crawfordsville
they
diverted
from
themselves
any
possible
suspicion
and
placed
langdon
where
he
would
have
to
bear
the
brunt
of
the
great
scandal
that
would
they
well
knew
come
out
at
some
future
time
after
their
foul
conspiracy
against
the
nation
had
been
consummated
after
the
fruits
of
their
betrayal
had
been
secured
what
after
all
the
schemers
concluded
is
the
little
matter
of
an
investigation
among
senators
to
guilty
senators
who
deeply
versed
in
the
law
have
destroyed
every
compromising
document
that
could
be
admissible
as
evidence
why
the
senate
would
appoint
an
investigating
committee
and
investigate
itself
would
it
not
when
the
ridiculous
scandal
came
and
what
senator
would
fear
himself
or
for
himself
as
he
investigated
himself
when
the
blame
had
already
been
put
publicly
on
some
one
else
some
old
soul
who
could
go
back
to
his
cotton
fields
in
mississippi
and
forget
all
about
it
strong
in
his
innocence
even
though
shorn
of
reputation
and
desire
to
live
chapter
x
when
senators
disagree
the
wiseacres
of
washington
had
rightly
predicted
that
the
site
of
the
gulf
naval
base
would
be
decided
on
in
march
after
the
excitement
and
gayety
attending
the
presidential
inauguration
had
subsided
on
the
morning
of
the
day
before
this
action
of
the
committee
on
naval
affairs
was
to
be
taken
secretary
haines
sat
at
his
desk
in
senator
langdon
committee
room
in
the
capitol
richard
cullen
the
favorite
associate
of
haines
in
his
journalistic
days
out
earlier
than
usual
on
his
daily
round
of
the
departments
for
news
for
his
chicago
paper
had
strolled
in
and
attempted
a
few
of
his
characteristic
cynicisms
haines
usually
found
them
entertaining
but
these
were
directed
at
senator
langdon
now
let
me
tell
you
something
dick
the
secretary
answered
firmly
do
you
work
off
all
your
dyspeptic
ideas
in
this
neighborhood
my
senator
is
a
great
man
they
ca
appreciate
him
up
here
because
he
honest
crystal
clear
i
used
to
think
i
knew
what
a
decent
citizen
a
real
man
ought
to
be
but
he
taught
me
some
new
things
he
teach
them
all
something
before
he
gets
through
cullen
hung
one
leg
over
haines
desk
you
a
nice
quiet
gentlemanly
little
optimist
and
i
like
you
old
fellow
retorted
cullen
but
do
deceive
yourself
too
much
your
senator
langdon
is
personally
one
of
the
best
ever
but
he
was
born
a
mark
and
a
mark
he
be
to
the
end
of
time
he
looks
good
now
sure
i
like
his
speeches
and
all
that
but
just
wait
when
some
of
those
old
foxes
in
the
senate
want
to
put
his
head
in
the
bag
and
tie
it
down
they
wo
have
any
trouble
at
all
smiling
haines
looked
up
at
his
cynical
friend
the
bag
have
to
go
over
my
head
too
he
said
with
a
nod
well
i
do
know
that
peabody
have
to
strain
himself
very
much
to
get
such
an
awful
big
bag
to
drop
you
both
in
if
it
comes
right
down
to
that
old
chap
you
making
a
mistake
you
as
bad
as
your
old
man
you
a
beautiful
pair
of
optimists
and
you
a
good
newspaper
man
too
it
a
shame
after
momentary
hesitation
cullen
continued
thoroughly
serious
but
my
old
friend
he
said
in
low
tone
glancing
quickly
about
there
one
thing
that
you
got
to
put
a
stop
to
it
hurting
you
the
secretary
face
showed
his
bewilderment
what
do
you
mean
he
snapped
abruptly
out
with
it
i
mean
replied
cullen
that
rumors
are
going
around
that
you
are
keeping
langdon
away
from
the
crowd
of
in
the
senate
for
your
own
purposes
that
in
short
you
plan
to
i
understand
was
the
quick
interruption
i
am
accused
of
wanting
to
senator
langdon
guarantee
his
vote
on
some
graft
proposition
so
that
i
can
get
the
money
and
not
he
himself
consequently
i
tipping
him
off
on
what
measures
are
honest
so
that
he
vote
for
them
until
until
i
offered
my
price
then
influence
him
to
vote
for
some
big
crooked
scheme
telling
him
it
is
all
right
he
votes
as
i
suggest
and
i
get
the
money
that
what
a
man
means
in
washington
dryly
answered
the
chicago
correspondent
it
means
winning
a
man
confidence
his
support
his
vote
through
friendship
and
then
selling
it
for
cash
but
you
dick
you
have
of
course
old
man
i
have
denied
the
truth
of
this
i
knew
you
too
well
to
doubt
you
still
the
yarn
is
hurting
you
remember
that
western
senator
who
was
twice
both
ways
on
a
graft
bill
he
laughingly
asked
the
secretary
should
say
i
did
dick
that
is
the
record
for
that
game
it
was
a
corporation
measure
one
railroad
wanted
it
another
opposed
it
the
senator
innocently
told
an
eastern
senator
that
he
was
going
to
vote
for
the
bill
then
the
easterner
went
to
the
railroad
wanting
the
bill
passed
and
got
on
his
absolute
promise
that
he
would
get
senator
to
vote
for
it
who
of
course
did
vote
for
it
yes
said
cullen
and
later
when
senator
heard
that
senator
had
got
money
for
his
vote
he
was
wild
then
when
another
effort
was
made
to
pass
the
bill
which
had
been
defeated
the
senator
said
to
as
he
met
him
unexpectedly
scoundrel
where
i
get
square
with
you
to
some
extent
anyway
i
going
to
vote
against
that
bill
this
time
and
make
a
long
speech
against
it
too
senator
then
hustled
to
the
lobbyist
of
the
railroad
that
wanted
the
bill
killed
and
guaranteed
him
that
for
he
could
get
senator
to
change
his
vote
to
vote
against
the
bill
and
he
got
the
money
too
both
ways
added
haines
as
cullen
concluded
and
both
railroads
to
this
day
think
that
received
the
money
from
z
of
course
said
cullen
but
was
to
blame
though
he
did
know
enough
to
keep
to
himself
how
he
was
going
to
vote
any
man
that
talks
that
way
will
be
i
know
how
to
stop
those
rumors
for
i
sure
it
peabody
work
he
thinking
langdon
will
hear
the
talk
and
mistrust
me
began
haines
when
in
came
senator
langdon
himself
his
face
beaming
contentedly
little
did
the
junior
senator
from
mississippi
realize
that
he
was
soon
to
face
the
severest
trial
the
most
vital
crisis
of
his
entire
life
cullen
responded
to
the
senator
cheery
greeting
of
mornin
everybody
senator
he
asked
my
paper
wants
your
opinion
on
the
question
of
the
election
of
senators
by
popular
vote
do
you
think
the
system
of
electing
senators
by
vote
of
state
legislatures
should
be
abolished
the
mississippian
cocked
his
head
to
one
side
i
reckon
that
a
question
that
concerns
future
senators
and
not
those
already
elected
he
chuckled
haines
laughed
at
cullen
who
thrust
his
pad
into
his
pocket
and
hurried
away
it
is
that
i
appear
before
the
ways
and
means
committee
it
langdon
queried
of
his
secretary
yes
said
haines
consulting
his
memorandum
book
at
you
go
before
ways
and
means
to
put
forward
the
needs
of
your
state
on
the
matter
of
the
reduction
of
the
tariff
on
aluminium
hydrates
the
people
of
mississippi
believe
it
has
actually
put
back
life
into
the
exhausted
cotton
lands
in
virginia
they
hope
to
use
it
on
the
tobacco
fields
where
does
the
pesky
stuff
come
from
asked
the
senator
from
south
america
coached
the
secretary
the
south
is
in
a
hurry
for
it
so
the
duty
must
come
down
you
have
to
bluff
a
bit
because
peabody
and
his
crowd
will
try
to
make
a
kind
of
bargain
wanting
you
to
keep
up
iron
and
steel
duties
but
you
believe
that
iron
and
steel
need
help
you
will
tell
them
do
you
see
so
that
they
will
feel
the
necessity
of
giving
you
what
you
want
for
the
south
in
order
to
gain
your
support
for
the
iron
and
steel
demands
the
office
door
opened
and
senator
peabody
appeared
peabody
whispered
the
secretary
instantly
the
mississippian
had
his
cue
his
back
to
peabody
he
rose
brought
down
his
fist
heavily
upon
the
desk
and
expounded
oratorically
to
haines
what
we
can
produce
of
aluminium
hydrates
my
boy
is
problematical
but
the
south
is
in
a
hurry
for
it
and
the
duty
must
come
down
got
to
come
down
and
i
not
going
to
do
anything
else
until
it
does
the
secretary
stretched
across
the
desk
excuse
me
senator
senator
peabody
is
here
he
said
loudly
and
surprisedly
as
though
he
had
just
sighted
the
boss
of
the
senate
the
mississippian
turned
oh
senator
i
was
just
talking
with
my
secretary
about
that
hydrate
clause
peabody
bowed
slightly
yes
i
knew
it
was
coming
up
he
said
so
i
just
dropped
over
i
not
opposed
to
it
or
any
southern
measure
but
it
makes
it
more
difficult
for
me
when
you
southern
people
oppose
certain
pittsburg
interests
that
i
have
to
take
care
of
langdon
smiled
i
never
been
in
pittsburg
but
they
tell
me
it
looks
as
if
it
could
take
care
of
itself
the
visitor
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
true
enough
but
give
and
take
is
the
rule
in
political
matters
langdon
this
remark
brought
a
frown
to
langdon
face
i
do
like
bargaining
between
gentlemen
peabody
more
important
still
i
do
believe
american
politics
has
to
be
run
on
that
plan
why
ca
we
change
a
lot
of
things
now
that
we
are
here
langdon
became
so
enthused
that
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
as
he
spoke
peabody
you
and
stevens
and
i
continued
langdon
could
get
our
friends
together
and
right
now
start
to
make
this
great
capital
of
our
great
country
the
place
of
the
deal
the
place
where
give
and
take
bargain
and
sale
are
unknown
we
could
start
a
movement
that
would
drive
out
all
secret
influences
the
secretary
noticed
peabody
involuntary
start
the
newspapers
would
help
us
went
on
langdon
public
opinion
would
be
with
us
and
both
houses
of
congress
would
have
to
join
in
the
work
if
we
went
out
in
front
led
the
way
and
showed
them
their
plain
duty
and
i
tell
you
senator
peabody
that
the
principles
that
gave
birth
to
this
country
the
principles
of
truth
honesty
justice
and
independence
would
rule
in
washington
if
washington
cared
anything
about
them
langdon
interjected
the
pennsylvanian
that
my
point
cried
the
mississippian
let
us
teach
washington
to
care
about
them
langdon
langdon
said
peabody
patronizingly
you
seized
on
a
bigger
task
than
you
know
after
you
reform
washington
you
will
have
to
go
on
and
reform
human
nature
human
instincts
every
human
being
in
the
country
if
you
want
to
make
politics
this
angelic
thing
you
describe
it
is
politics
it
humanity
that
wrong
waving
aside
a
protest
from
langdon
anyway
your
idea
is
not
constitutional
langdon
continued
peabody
you
want
everybody
to
have
a
share
in
the
national
government
that
would
meet
the
theory
of
centralization
woven
into
our
political
system
by
its
founders
they
intended
that
our
government
should
be
controlled
by
a
limited
number
of
representatives
so
that
authority
can
be
fixed
and
responsibility
ascertained
you
distort
my
meaning
cried
langdon
and
senator
i
would
like
to
ask
why
so
many
constitutional
lawyers
who
enter
congress
spend
so
much
time
in
placing
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
between
themselves
and
their
duty
sir
between
the
people
and
their
government
sir
between
the
nation
and
its
destiny
i
want
to
know
if
in
your
opinion
the
constitution
was
designed
to
throttle
expression
of
the
public
will
of
course
not
that
the
reason
you
and
i
langdon
and
the
others
are
elected
to
the
senate
added
peabody
starting
to
leave
then
he
halted
by
the
way
senator
he
said
i
do
my
best
to
arrange
what
you
want
regarding
aluminium
hydrates
for
the
sake
of
the
south
and
i
also
stand
with
you
for
altacoola
for
the
naval
base
our
committee
is
to
make
its
report
langdon
observed
the
penetrating
gaze
that
peabody
had
fixed
on
him
it
seemed
to
betray
that
the
pennsylvanian
apparently
careless
manner
was
assumed
h
coughed
langdon
glancing
at
haines
i
not
absolutely
committed
to
altacoola
until
i
sure
it
the
best
place
i
make
up
my
mind
definitely
and
i
it
will
be
for
altacoola
the
boss
of
the
senate
went
out
glaring
venomously
at
haines
slamming
the
door
a
moment
later
a
page
boy
brought
in
a
card
colonel
telfer

read

he
remarked

as

his
flushed
face
grew
redder
his
long
white
hair
became
disordered
and
he
tugged
at
his
white
mustache
continually
as
he
waxed

and
there

a

said
that

the

sat
directly
in

of

at
the
opposite
side
of
his
desk
regaining
his
composure
he
suddenly
leaned
forward
and
half
whispered
to
the

an
another
fo
you
too
we
made
this
we
outbid
altacoola
overall
time
po
sports
an
hate
to
give
up
so
altacoola
is
bidding
too
excitedly
asked
haines
why
of
it
is
ah
yo
as
blind
as
that
o
ah
yo
foolin
with
me
questioned
telfer
suspiciously
seems
to
me
yo
ought
to
know
more
about
that
end
of
it
than
a
fellah
clear
from
th
gulf
certainly
certainly
mumbled
haines
impatiently
as
he
endeavored
to
associate
coherently
intelligently
in
his
mind
those
startling
new
revelations
of
telfer
with
certain
incidents
he
had
previously
noted
in
the
operations
of
the
committee
on
naval
affairs
then
he
looked
across
at
the
mayor
and
smiled
apparently
he
had
heard
nothing
to
amaze
him
colonel
he
returned
calmly
dropping
into
a
voice
that
sounded
of
pity
for
the
gray
hairs
of
the
lobbyist
about
fifty
men
a
day
come
to
me
with
propositions
like
that
there
is
nothing
doing
colonel
i
could
possibly
interest
senator
langdon
because
he
has
the
faculty
of
judging
for
himself
and
he
would
be
prejudiced
against
either
town
that
came
out
with
such
a
proposition
lan
speculation
is
legitimate
protested
the
colonel
cunningly
haines
agreed
certainly
by
outsiders
but
it
d
d
thievery
when
engaged
in
by
any
one
connected
with
putting
a
bill
through
if
i
were
to
tell
senator
langdon
what
you
have
told
me
it
would
decide
him
unalterably
in
favor
of
altacoola
senator
langdon
sir
is
one
of
the
few
men
in
washington
who
would
rather
be
thought
a
fool
than
a
grafter
if
it
came
down
to
that
the
mayor
of
gulf
city
jumped
to
his
feet
his
face
blazing
in
rage
not
in
shame
seems
to
me
yo
mighty
fresh
young
man
he
blustered
what
kind
of
politics
is
langdon
playin
not
fresh
colonel
only
friendly
i
just
tipping
you
off
how
not
to
be
a
friend
to
altacoola
as
to
his
politics
the
senator
will
answer
you
himself
a
scornful
laugh
accompanied
telfer
reply
altacoola
huh
i
reckon
yo
must
be
a
fool
after
all
why
everybody
knows
of
the
speculatin
in
land
around
altacoola
and
everybody
knows
it
ai
outsiders
that
doin
it
it
the
insiders
right
here
in
washington
if
yo
ai
in
yo
can
easy
get
a
latchkey
young
man
yo
find
out
things
some
day
and
yo
drop
to
it
all
i
guess
i
was
too
late
with
yo
that
about
the
size
of
it
i
guess
altacoola
talk
to
yo
went
on
the
mayor
if
that
feller
fairbrother
of
altacoola
had
been
able
to
hold
his
tongue
maybe
i
would
know
so
much
but
now
i
know
what
what
i
know
this
that
yo
either
a
big
fool
or
an
insider
yo
a
nice
young
feller
i
have
taken
a
fancy
to
yo
i
like
to
see
yo
young
fellers
get
along
and
not
miss
chances
come
my
boy
get
wise
to
get
wise
to
climb
on
to
the
band
wagon
with
yo
friends
bud
concluded
that
he
might
be
able
to
get
more
definite
information
out
of
telfer
if
he
humored
him
a
bit
i
tell
you
colonel
he
finally
said
these
are
pretty
grave
charges
you
making
but
i
tell
you
confidentially
owing
to
your
liking
for
me
that
it
is
not
yet
too
late
to
do
something
for
gulf
city
now
just
suppose
you
and
i
dine
together
early
and
we
go
over
the
whole
ground
to
see
how
things
lie
will
you
the
colonel
held
out
his
hand
smiling
broadly
he
felt
that
at
last
he
had
won
the
secretary
over
that
the
young
man
was
at
heart
anxious
to
take
money
for
his
influence
with
the
senator
all
right
my
boy
yo
on
we
dine
together
yo
are
absolutely
certain
that
it
wo
be
too
late
to
get
to
senator
langdon
absolutely
positive
i
would
make
a
mistake
in
a
matter
like
this
would
i
unless
i
was
what
you
said
i
was
a
fool
of
course
not
oh
yo
a
slick
one
i
like
to
do
business
with
folks
like
yo
it
mighty
educatin
thanks
answered
bud
dryly
it
certain
that
langdon
wo
decide
which
place
he
for
until
i
promise
you
that
he
decide
until
after
i
have
my
talk
with
you
yo
see
said
telfer
i
asked
that
question
because
as
probably
know
congressman
norton
and
his
crowd
is
pretty
close
to
senator
langdon
haines
cut
him
short
with
a
gasp
of
surprise
norton
telfer
wrinkling
his
forehead
incredulously
looked
at
haines
surest
thing
you
know
my
boy
bud
turned
his
head
away
in
thought
oh
leave
the
norton
outfit
to
me
i
fool
them
he
finally
said
good
telfer
shook
the
secretary
hand
heartily
yo
no
fool
my
boy
anybody
can
see
that
after
they
get
to
know
yo
all
that
what
comes
of
bein
one
of
them
smooth
new
yorkers
they
mighty
sanctimonious
on
th
outside
but
on
th
inside
they
the
real
goods
all
right
the
lobbyist
hurried
away
his
bibulous
soul
swelling
with
satisfaction
he
was
sure
of
triumphing
over
altacoola
and
he
was
willing
to
pay
the
price
haines
sank
back
into
his
chair
i
wonder
what
washington
he
murmured
are
speculating
in
altacoola
land
telfer
mentions
norton
name
i
wonder
the
door
opened
and
before
him
stood
carolina
langdon
ah
miss
langdon
he
exclaimed
i
am
glad
to
see
you
she
walked
to
him
and
extended
cordially
a
slender
gloved
hand
this
is
a
real
pleasure
haines
she
began
i
been
waiting
to
talk
to
you
for
some
time
it
about
something
important
something
important
smiled
haines
you
want
to
see
me
about
something
important
well
let
me
tell
you
a
secret
every
time
i
see
you
it
is
an
important
occasion
to
me
carolina
langdon
had
never
appeared
more
charming
more
beautiful
to
young
haines
than
she
did
that
day
perhaps
she
appeared
more
inspiring
because
of
the
contrast
her
presence
afforded
to
the
unpleasant
episodes
through
which
he
had
just
passed
also
carolina
was
dressed
in
her
most
becoming
street
gown
which
she
well
realized
as
she
was
enacting
a
carefully
planned
part
with
the
unfortunate
secretary
his
frankness
and
the
sincere
admiration
that
shone
in
his
eyes
caused
her
to
falter
momentarily
almost
made
her
weaken
in
her
purpose
but
she
made
an
effort
and
secured
a
firmer
grip
on
herself
for
she
must
play
a
rôle
that
would
crush
to
earth
the
air
castles
this
young
secretary
was
building
a
rôle
that
would
crush
the
ideals
of
this
young
optimist
as
well
chapter
xii
the
cure
of
a
woman
love
carolina
had
come
to
find
out
from
haines
if
possible
how
her
father
was
going
to
vote
on
the
naval
base
and
to
induce
the
secretary
to
persuade
him
to
stand
for
altacoola
if
there
seemed
danger
that
he
would
vote
for
another
site
that
was
her
scheme
for
carolina
had
put
into
altacoola
land
money
left
by
her
mother
norton
had
persuaded
carolina
to
invest
in
the
enterprise
to
defraud
the
government
promising
her
clear
profit
how
much
she
could
do
in
washington
society
with
that
the
continued
uncertainty
over
her
father
final
attitude
had
strained
her
nerves
almost
to
the
breaking
for
the
success
of
the
conspiracy
depended
on
his
vote
not
even
the
words
of
norton
her
future
husband
could
reassure
her
her
worry
was
increased
by
the
knowledge
of
randolph
investment
of
her
father
that
carolina
must
sacrifice
haines
on
the
altar
of
her
consuming
desire
for
money
for
a
higher
worldly
position
was
an
unimportant
consideration
he
stood
in
the
way
any
moment
he
might
discover
the
existence
of
the
altacoola
scheme
he
would
immediately
tell
her
father
and
she
knew
her
father
would
immediately
decide
against
altacoola
the
bright
hopes
of
her
future
would
turn
to
ashes
norton
money
as
well
was
invested
in
altacoola
he
too
would
be
ruined
she
was
sure
that
she
loved
norton
but
she
could
not
marry
a
penniless
man
carolina
resumed
the
conversation
it
is
anything
so
very
important
haines
it
about
father
haines
beamed
i
have
the
honor
to
report
miss
langdon
he
bowed
that
your
father
is
making
the
very
best
kind
of
a
senator
the
girl
hesitated
yes
he
might
if
he
had
some
ambition
do
worry
if
it
comes
down
to
that
i
have
ambition
for
two
you
want
him
to
be
a
success
do
you
well
he
is
the
biggest
kind
of
a
success
i
never
believed
that
he
would
be
confessed
the
daughter
haines
laughed
why
do
you
realize
that
he
is
one
of
the
most
popular
men
in
public
life
throughout
the
country
that
does
langdon
think
has
become
the
watchword
of
the
big
body
of
independents
who
want
honesty
and
decent
government
without
graft
i
tell
you
that
a
big
thing
miss
langdon
that
success
real
success
in
politics
especially
in
washington
politics
now
if
there
anything
else
you
want
him
to
have
i
see
that
he
gets
it
i
try
to
get
it
for
him
he
paused
a
minute
then
added
with
heartfelt
meaning
in
his
voice
and
for
you
miss
langdon
carolina
played
coquettishly
with
the
secretary
for
me
mr
haines
she
questioned
archly
with
an
effective
glance
into
his
eyes
bud
pulses
began
to
throb
violently
to
leap
yes
he
exclaimed
unsteadily
for
you
and
you
know
it
that
the
inspiration
now
my
inspiration
the
chance
of
winning
your
belief
in
me
of
winning
something
more
the
biggest
thing
i
ever
thought
to
win
because
miss
langdon
carolina
i
love
you
he
bent
over
and
seized
the
girl
hand
ever
since
the
day
i
first
saw
you
i
she
shook
her
head
indulgently
and
in
a
moment
drew
her
hand
from
his
you
must
be
so
serious
haines
you
do
understand
southern
girls
at
all
we
are
not
just
like
northern
girls
we
are
used
to
being
made
love
to
from
the
time
we
are
sometimes
i
fear
we
flirt
a
little
but
we
do
mean
any
harm
all
girls
flirt
a
little
but
somebody
wins
even
the
southern
girls
declared
haines
eagerly
the
girl
face
became
serious
earnest
sincere
yes
somebody
does
always
she
said
and
when
a
southern
girl
is
won
she
stays
won
mr
haines
and
i
have
a
chance
to
win
questioned
the
determined
young
northerner
carolina
smiled
sweetly
and
expressively
who
knows
first
make
my
father
even
a
bigger
success
that
first
oh
i
wonder
if
you
can
realize
what
all
this
life
means
to
me
if
you
can
realize
what
those
years
of
stagnating
on
the
plantation
meant
to
me
no
man
would
have
endured
it
she
exclaimed
bitterly
i
am
more
of
a
man
than
a
woman
in
some
ways
i
ambitious
from
the
time
i
was
a
little
girl
i
wanted
the
world
power
fame
money
i
want
them
still
i
mean
to
get
them
somehow
anyhow
if
i
ca
get
them
myself
some
one
must
get
them
for
me
and
love
suggested
the
man
you
are
leaving
love
out
suppose
i
get
all
these
things
for
you
bud
pounding
heart
almost
stopped
he
could
scarcely
gain
his
breath
as
he
saw
creep
into
carolina
eyes
what
he
believed
to
be
the
light
of
hope
for
him
the
light
even
of
a
woman
promise
who
knows
haines
there
no
reward
guaranteed
there
may
be
others
trying
she
answered
haines
laughed
the
strong
hopeful
fighting
laugh
of
the
man
who
would
combat
the
boss
of
the
senate
on
ground
of
the
boss
own
choosing
all
right
he
cried
if
it
an
open
fight
i
enlist
i
give
them
all
a
run
what
are
your
orders
carolina
appeared
indifferent
i
do
know
that
i
have
any
particular
orders
sir
knight
except
to
see
that
my
father
does
all
he
can
for
the
altacoola
naval
base
haines
paused
seized
by
a
sudden
tremor
the
altacoola
naval
base
he
stammered
well
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
senator
will
do
what
he
thinks
right
that
might
bring
power
and
fame
a
right
decision
in
this
case
but
it
ca
bring
money
carolina
shrugged
her
shoulders
money
she
laughed
with
affected
carelessness
well
we
have
to
let
the
money
take
care
of
itself
for
a
time
but
i
do
want
him
to
vote
for
altacoola
because
i
believe
that
will
be
the
best
for
him
you
believe
in
altacoola
do
you
haines
hesitated
then
answered
well
between
the
two
sites
merely
as
sites
altacoola
seems
to
me
rather
better
miss
langdon
held
out
her
hand
impulsively
then
it
will
be
altacoola
she
cried
thank
you
haines
we
are
partners
then
for
altacoola
the
young
man
grasped
her
hand
earnestly
i
like
to
be
your
partner
for
good
carolina
he
cried
they
stood
there
close
together
holding
each
other
hands
looking
into
each
other
eyes
when
the
door
opened
and
in
came
charles
norton
chapter
xiii
an
father
congressman
norton
was
startled
at
the
sight
of
carolina
and
haines
apparently
so
wrapped
up
in
each
other
perhaps
she
was
getting
interested
in
the
handsome
interfering
secretary
that
a
woman
sometimes
breaks
her
promise
to
wed
he
well
knew
plainly
carolina
was
carrying
things
too
far
for
a
girl
who
was
the
promised
wife
of
another
carolina
and
haines
showed
surprise
at
norton
entrance
the
congressman
advanced
and
spoke
sneeringly
his
demeanor
marking
him
to
be
in
a
dangerous
mood
do
i
intrude
he
drawled
deliberately
carolina
drew
away
her
hands
from
haines
and
faced
the
newcomer
intrude
she
exclaimed
contemptuously
in
a
tone
that
norton
construed
as
in
his
favor
and
haines
in
his
own
intrude
haines
laughed
sarcastically
feeling
that
now
he
was
leader
in
the
race
for
love
against
this
mississippi
representative
who
was
he
knew
a
subservient
tool
and
a
taker
of
bribes
you
surely
do
intrude
norton
would
any
man
who
had
interrupted
a
another
man
was
having
with
miss
langdon
be
intruding
i
suppose
i
ca
deny
that
he
replied
the
secretary
smiled
again
i
match
you
to
see
who
stays
he
said
but
norton
turn
to
defeat
his
rival
had
come
he
held
out
a
paper
to
haines
senator
langdon
gave
me
this
for
you
i
reckon
i
do
have
to
match
the
secretary
opened
the
note
to
read
where
in
thunder
does
that
hydrate
come
from
south
america
or
russia
how
much
off
on
the
tariff
on
the
creature
do
we
want
come
over
to
the
committee
room
where
i
am
right
away
say
an
urgent
message
and
get
in
with
a
tip
the
secretary
looked
up
with
a
laugh
you
win
norton
i
off
and
he
started
on
a
run
to
the
senator
aid
norton
turned
angrily
on
the
girl
as
the
door
closed
see
here
carolina
he
cried
what
do
you
mean
by
letting
that
fellow
make
love
to
you
carolina
langdon
would
not
permit
rebuke
even
from
the
man
she
cared
for
she
tossed
back
her
head
and
said
coolly
why
should
i
let
him
make
love
to
me
if
i
choose
you
know
why
exclaimed
norton
his
dark
face
flushing
sullenly
because
i
love
you
and
you
love
me
and
he
seized
her
and
pressed
her
to
him
that
is
why
he
cried
and
he
kissed
her
again
and
again
yes
i
love
you
charlie
you
know
that
carolina
said
simply
she
was
conquered
by
the
southerner
masterfulness
then
why
do
you
stand
for
that
whippersnapper
talk
asked
norton
perplexedly
carolina
laughed
do
you
see
charlie
i
have
to
stand
for
it
i
have
to
stand
for
it
for
your
sake
for
randolph
sake
for
my
own
sake
for
all
our
sakes
you
know
the
influence
he
has
over
father
he
can
make
father
do
anything
he
wants
and
suppose
i
do
lead
him
on
where
our
project
let
him
suspect
a
thing
and
let
him
go
to
father
and
you
know
what
will
happen
father
would
turn
against
that
altacoola
scheme
in
a
moment
he
beggar
himself
if
it
were
necessary
rather
than
let
a
single
one
of
us
make
a
dollar
out
of
a
thing
he
had
to
decide
you
right
i
reckon
carolina
said
norton
dejectedly
your
father
is
a
real
type
of
the
southern
gentleman
he
has
seen
any
real
money
in
so
long
he
ca
even
bear
to
think
of
it
got
to
make
money
out
of
this
and
we
should
be
the
ones
we
lose
frightfully
charlie
if
they
changed
to
gulf
city
would
we
said
the
girl
apprehensively
i
horribly
afraid
sometimes
charlie
that
why
i
came
here
i
wanted
to
influence
haines
to
keep
him
straight
is
there
any
danger
that
they
change
you
do
think
there
is
do
you
of
course
not
child
stevens
has
got
his
money
in
and
peabody
there
are
only
five
on
the
committee
it
bound
to
go
through
then
why
is
father
so
important
to
them
asked
carolina
it
past
my
understanding
carolina
i
do
see
how
he
done
it
but
the
whole
country
has
come
to
believe
whatever
your
father
does
is
right
and
they
got
to
have
him
and
father
is
completely
under
the
domination
of
this
secretary
murmured
the
girl
thoughtfully
norton
nodded
we
got
to
get
rid
of
him
carolina
that
all
there
is
to
it
he
has
to
go
when
it
comes
to
bossing
the
senator
and
making
love
to
you
too
he
getting
too
strong
how
can
you
do
it
she
asked
you
know
when
father
likes
any
one
he
wo
believe
a
thing
against
him
norton
agreed
sorrowfully
that
right
seems
like
the
senator
coming
to
think
more
of
this
fellow
than
he
does
of
his
own
family
why
i
would
be
surprised
if
he
even
let
one
of
you
girls
marry
him
if
he
wanted
to
marry
you
we
have
something
to
say
about
that
carolina
laughed
amusedly
do
you
think
that
hope
or
i
could
ever
care
for
a
man
like
this
fellow
of
course
not
this
altacoola
business
must
go
through
right
it
would
be
too
cruel
not
to
have
it
so
and
then
and
then
you
and
i
be
married
at
once
carolina
whether
your
father
likes
it
or
not
ended
norton
for
her
with
altacoola
safe
we
can
do
as
we
please
as
between
us
we
be
rich
what
does
it
matter
how
we
get
the
money
as
long
as
we
get
it
chapter
xiv
when
a
daughter
betrays
her
father
bud
returned
to
find
miss
langdon
and
norton
still
in
the
room
new
buoyancy
new
courage
thrilled
in
his
veins
he
would
give
this
congressman
the
battle
of
his
life
for
this
prize
of
that
he
was
confident
i
have
an
engagement
with
holcomb
senator
holcomb
wife
she
said
so
i
must
hurry
away
but
i
expect
to
be
back
to
see
father
i
think
i
just
wait
suggested
norton
i
have
to
see
the
senator
as
soon
as
possible
and
he
ought
to
return
from
that
ways
and
means
committee
meeting
pretty
soon
when
carolina
had
gone
a
slight
feeling
of
constraint
settled
over
the
two
the
senator
pretty
busy
these
days
with
his
naval
base
matter
coming
up
is
he
yes
keeps
him
pretty
busy
receiving
delegations
from
altacoola
and
gulf
city
and
patting
them
both
on
the
back
said
haines
had
a
man
from
gulf
city
in
this
morning
with
some
pretty
strong
arguments
the
secretary
watched
norton
keenly
to
note
the
effect
of
this
hint
in
favor
of
gulf
city
gulf
city
norton
sneered
shucks
who
put
a
naval
base
on
a
bunch
of
mud
flats
i
reckon
those
gulf
city
fellows
are
wasting
their
time
think
so
suggested
haines
are
you
absolutely
sure
norton
started
why
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
he
exclaimed
that
senator
langdon
would
vote
for
gulf
city
for
the
naval
base
i
do
mean
to
tell
you
anything
congressman
was
the
cool
rejoinder
it
not
my
business
the
senator
the
one
who
does
the
talking
an
ugly
sneer
wrinkled
the
congressman
face
well
i
glad
he
attends
to
his
own
business
and
does
trust
too
many
people
he
said
pointedly
the
secretary
smiled
in
puzzling
fashion
that
exactly
why
i
do
talk
congressman
he
said
pleasantly
the
senator
does
trust
too
many
people
if
he
did
there
might
be
too
much
money
made
out
of
land
speculation
senator
langdon
happen
to
be
one
of
those
senators
who
care
for
that
kind
of
thing
i
suppose
you
think
you
pretty
strong
with
the
senator
ventured
the
mississippian
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
thought
very
much
about
it
replied
haines
but
if
you
come
right
down
to
it
i
guess
i
am
pretty
strong
suppose
you
influenced
him
in
the
naval
base
business
then
still
the
secretary
smiled
keeping
his
temper
under
the
adroit
attack
well
i
think
he
listen
to
me
with
considerable
interest
but
you
for
altacoola
of
course
haines
shook
his
head
no
i
ca
say
that
i
for
altacoola
fellow
who
was
in
here
this
morning
put
up
a
pretty
good
argument
to
my
mind
for
gulf
city
in
fact
he
made
it
pretty
strong
seemed
to
show
it
was
all
to
my
interest
to
go
in
with
gulf
city
think
i
have
to
investigate
a
little
more
i
tell
you
norton
spoke
haines
in
a
confidential
manner
this
land
speculation
fever
is
a
frightful
thing
while
i
was
talking
to
this
fellow
from
gulf
city
i
almost
caught
it
myself
probably
if
i
met
the
head
of
the
altacoola
speculation
i
might
catch
the
fever
from
him
too
why
do
you
put
your
money
into
gulf
city
and
lose
it
then
replied
norton
nodding
his
head
scornfully
that
be
a
good
lesson
for
a
rising
young
politician
like
you
senator
langdon
secretary
peered
straight
into
norton
eyes
because
congressman
he
said
if
i
were
to
put
my
money
in
gulf
city
perhaps
i
would
lose
it
the
southerner
took
a
step
forward
leaned
over
and
glared
angrily
at
haines
his
face
whitened
you
do
mean
that
you
could
swing
langdon
into
gulf
city
he
gasped
haines
smiled
i
ca
say
that
norton
but
i
guess
people
interested
in
altacoola
would
hate
to
have
me
try
i
did
know
you
were
that
kind
haines
said
norton
his
virtue
aroused
at
the
thought
of
losing
his
money
so
you
playing
the
game
like
all
the
rest
why
should
i
shrugged
the
secretary
i
guess
perhaps
i
a
little
sore
because
the
altacoola
people
have
even
paid
me
the
compliment
of
thinking
i
had
any
influence
so
they
ca
expect
me
to
work
for
them
the
gulf
city
people
have
as
things
stand
gulf
city
looks
pretty
good
to
me
is
this
straight
talk
exclaimed
norton
take
it
or
leave
it
retorted
bud
the
mississippian
leaned
with
his
hands
on
the
desk
well
haines
if
you
like
the
rest
and
are
really
interested
in
altacoola
i
do
know
that
you
have
to
go
very
far
to
talk
you
know
something
of
altacoola
lands
then
norton
said
robert
tingling
with
suppressed
excitement
he
felt
that
he
was
getting
close
to
real
facts
in
a
colossal
deal
norton
was
sure
of
his
man
now
well
i
am
in
touch
with
some
people
who
got
lands
and
options
on
more
i
might
fix
it
for
you
to
come
in
he
whispered
haines
shook
his
head
you
know
i
have
much
money
norton
all
i
could
put
in
would
be
my
influence
who
are
these
people
are
they
cheap
little
local
folks
or
are
they
real
people
here
who
have
some
power
and
can
do
something
that
is
worth
while
do
i
look
like
i
fool
with
cheap
skates
haines
they
the
real
people
i
think
haines
that
either
senator
stevens
or
senator
peabody
would
advise
you
that
you
are
safe
ah
then
stevens
and
peabody
are
the
ones
they
make
it
altacoola
then
sell
to
the
government
at
a
big
advance
and
move
to
street
that
right
agreed
norton
bud
haines
straightened
abruptly
the
expression
on
his
face
gave
norton
a
sudden
chill
made
him
tremble
now
i
got
you
cried
the
secretary
you
given
yourself
dead
away
i
known
all
along
you
a
d
d
thief
norton
and
just
proved
it
to
me
yourself
what
do
you
mean
norton
was
clenching
his
fist
words
like
that
mean
fight
to
a
southerner
i
mean
that
before
senator
langdon
goes
one
step
further
in
this
matter
he
shall
know
that
his
colleagues
and
you
are
thieves
norton
trying
to
use
him
for
a
to
steal
for
them
from
the
government
i
suspected
something
this
morning
when
gulf
city
tried
to
bribe
me
and
a
visitor
from
there
gave
me
what
turns
out
to
be
a
pretty
good
tip
so
that
was
your
dirty
trick
exclaimed
the
congressman
as
he
regained
his
composure
set
a
thief
to
catch
a
real
one
laughed
the
secretary
very
good
trick
i
think
i
make
you
pay
for
that
cried
norton
shaking
his
fist
all
right
send
in
your
bill
any
old
time
laughed
haines
the
sooner
the
better
meantime
i
going
to
talk
to
langdon
he
had
started
for
the
door
when
carolina
langdon
followed
by
her
brother
randolph
wait
a
minute
said
norton
with
unexpected
quietness
i
do
what
you
about
to
do
mr
haines
of
course
you
would
sneered
haines
i
mean
that
you
will
be
making
a
mistake
haines
to
tell
the
senator
what
you
have
learned
rejoined
the
southerner
struggling
to
keep
calm
at
this
critical
moment
when
all
was
at
stake
he
realized
further
that
now
was
the
time
to
put
haines
out
of
the
way
if
that
were
possible
a
mistake
haines
he
continued
because
you
see
you
do
know
as
much
as
you
think
i
would
talk
to
langdon
if
i
were
you
it
will
only
embarrass
him
and
do
no
good
because
langdon
money
is
in
this
scheme
too
and
langdon
in
the
same
boat
with
the
rest
of
us
haines
stopped
short
at
this
astounding
charge
against
his
chief
norton
you
lie
i
believe
it
of
langdon
when
he
tells
me
so
not
otherwise
norton
turned
to
randolph
perhaps
you
believe
langdon
son
mr
haines
randolph
langdon
stepped
forward
it
true
haines
he
said
my
father
money
is
in
altacoola
lands
haines
looked
him
up
and
down
with
a
sneer
money
may
be
he
said
i
do
think
you
a
bit
too
good
for
it
but
your
father
is
a
different
kind
carolina
langdon
stood
at
the
back
of
the
room
nervously
awaiting
the
moment
when
she
knew
she
would
be
forced
into
the
unpleasant
discussion
i
reckon
you
ca
refuse
to
believe
miss
langdon
drawled
norton
with
aggravated
deliberation
of
course
stammered
haines
i
believe
it
if
miss
langdon
says
it
so
the
congressman
turned
toward
carolina
as
he
spoke
and
fixed
on
her
a
tense
look
which
spelled
as
plainly
as
though
spoken
it
all
in
your
hands
my
fortune
yours
she
slowly
drew
across
the
room
haines
could
hardly
conceal
the
turmoil
of
his
mind
the
world
seemed
suddenly
snatched
from
around
him
leaving
her
figure
alone
before
him
would
she
affirm
what
norton
and
randolph
had
said
he
must
believe
her
but
surely
it
was
impossible
that
she
carolina
played
for
time
she
feared
the
making
of
a
false
move
i
do
understand
she
said
inquiringly
to
norton
he
calmly
began
an
elaborate
explanation
miss
langdon
this
secretary
has
discovered
that
there
is
a
certain
perfectly
legitimate
venture
in
altacoola
lands
being
carried
on
through
certain
influential
people
we
know
and
by
me
the
blood
of
the
young
reformer
is
boiling
he
is
going
straight
to
your
father
with
the
facts
i
have
tried
to
explain
to
him
how
it
will
needlessly
embarrass
the
senator
and
spoil
his
own
future
he
wo
believe
me
he
believe
your
brother
perhaps
you
can
make
it
clear
at
last
carolina
nerved
herself
to
speak
you
had
better
not
go
to
my
father
haines
it
will
do
no
good
he
is
in
the
deal
you
must
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
so
the
girl
took
her
eyes
from
the
secretary
he
was
plainly
suffering
chapter
xv
carolina
langdon
advice
let
me
speak
to
haines
alone
said
carolina
to
norton
and
her
brother
norton
turned
a
triumphant
grin
at
randolph
as
he
beckoned
him
out
and
whispered
leave
him
to
her
it
all
right
that
new
york
dude
has
been
riding
for
a
fall
he
going
to
get
it
now
i
am
sorry
so
sorry
this
should
have
occurred
haines
carolina
said
gently
the
secretary
looked
up
slowly
his
face
drawn
it
was
an
effort
for
him
to
speak
i
ca
understand
it
he
said
i
might
have
thought
so
much
of
this
a
month
ago
but
i
have
come
to
love
the
senator
almost
as
a
son
and
to
think
that
he
could
be
like
the
rest
of
that
bunch
is
awful
you
are
too
much
of
an
idealist
haines
said
the
girl
and
you
what
do
you
think
of
it
he
demanded
the
girl
glance
wavered
do
idealize
me
too
much
either
haines
i
did
think
it
was
much
perhaps
i
do
understand
business
any
too
well
but
you
see
now
insisted
the
man
the
girl
looked
up
at
him
sorrowfully
yes
i
see
at
least
that
you
and
father
can
never
work
together
now
haines
nodded
affirmatively
i
suppose
so
i
thinking
of
that
how
am
i
to
leave
him
we
been
so
close
i
been
so
fond
of
him
i
do
know
how
i
could
tell
him
in
girlish
friendly
fashion
carolina
rested
her
hand
on
his
arm
wo
you
take
my
advice
haines
go
away
without
seeing
him
just
leave
a
note
to
say
you
have
gone
he
will
understand
it
will
be
easier
for
both
that
way
easier
for
him
easier
for
you
she
paused
looking
at
him
appealingly
as
she
ended
very
softly
and
easier
for
me
mr
haines
he
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
easier
for
you
he
said
very
well
i
do
it
that
way
the
secretary
stepped
slowly
to
his
desk
sat
down
and
started
to
write
the
note
carolina
watched
him
curiously
what
will
you
do
she
asked
now
that
you
have
given
up
this
position
oh
i
can
always
go
back
to
newspaper
work
he
answered
without
looking
up
the
term
newspaper
work
gave
carolina
a
shock
she
had
forgotten
that
this
man
had
been
a
reporter
here
he
was
turned
loose
with
the
knowledge
of
this
deal
which
she
knew
would
be
popular
material
for
newspapers
to
print
she
must
gain
still
another
point
and
she
felt
that
she
had
enough
power
to
win
against
him
i
going
to
ask
you
still
another
favor
she
said
bud
returned
her
look
with
a
bitter
smile
what
is
it
you
have
learned
about
this
this
land
matter
and
oh
yes
i
can
guess
you
want
me
to
keep
quiet
about
it
to
hush
it
up
a
shade
of
scorn
in
his
tone
i
only
asked
this
so
that
you
would
not
disgrace
me
she
pleaded
disillusioned
at
last
robbed
of
his
lifelong
optimism
shorn
of
his
ideals
even
his
love
for
he
began
to
despise
this
beautiful
misguided
woman
haines
sat
broken
in
spirit
thinking
how
quickly
the
brightness
of
life
fades
to
blackness
very
well
he
said
sadly
i
suppose
are
innocent
i
save
you
if
they
all
your
father
too
crooked
why
should
i
be
crooked
all
right
i
wo
say
anything
i
only
ask
you
not
to
disgrace
me
pleaded
the
girl
you
will
promise
that
it
a
promise
she
sighed
in
relief
father
will
be
coming
back
soon
she
said
you
wo
want
to
see
him
haines
arose
no
i
wo
want
to
see
him
give
him
this
note
i
have
to
come
back
while
he
away
to
clear
up
some
things
haines
bowed
and
hurried
from
the
room
through
a
side
doorway
just
as
senator
langdon
came
in
through
the
main
entrance
bud
bud
he
called
but
the
secretary
did
not
halt
carolina
langdon
stood
with
haines
note
in
her
hand
wondering
at
what
she
had
done
she
regretted
having
become
entangled
in
the
wars
of
men
in
washington
she
saw
that
the
man
game
was
played
too
strongly
too
furiously
fast
for
most
women
to
enter
yet
she
rejoiced
that
the
coveted
fortune
had
not
been
lost
she
was
sorry
that
her
means
of
saving
it
had
not
been
less
questionable
she
saw
that
ambition
and
honesty
ambition
and
truth
with
difficulty
follow
the
same
path
senator
langdon
face
was
unusually
grave
as
he
came
to
greet
carolina
lines
showed
in
his
face
that
the
daughter
had
never
noticed
before
she
saw
norton
and
randolph
who
had
followed
him
exchange
significant
glances
jubilant
glances
and
wondered
what
new
development
they
had
maneuvered
he
gone
without
a
word
the
senator
sighed
well
perhap
best
he
left
a
note
for
you
said
the
girl
handing
him
the
letter
which
haines
had
given
her
langdon
opened
it
and
read
i
am
giving
up
the
job
you
can
understand
why
the
least
said
about
it
between
us
the
better
i
am
sorry
that
all
bud
haines
slowly
he
read
the
letter
a
second
time
and
he
was
making
the
best
kind
of
a
secretary
i
thought
divining
that
something
against
haines
had
been
told
her
father
carolina
glanced
at
norton
i
told
your
father
how
we
caught
haines
he
spoke
as
an
answer
to
her
the
girl
was
startled
she
had
not
thought
that
things
would
go
this
far
i
told
him
how
haines
wanted
to
get
in
some
land
speculation
scheme
with
altacoola
how
we
tricked
him
and
caught
him
with
the
goods
when
he
made
the
proposition
to
me
and
how
we
forced
him
to
confess
you
told
father
that
gasped
carolina
norton
nodded
i
do
understand
it
said
langdon
to
think
that
he
was
that
kind
son
randolph
now
took
his
turn
in
the
case
against
the
secretary
we
were
both
here
father
i
heard
him
carolina
heard
him
he
said
did
you
carolina
yes
said
the
girl
weakly
i
was
here
then
she
turned
abruptly
i
must
go
she
said
must
go
right
away
holcomb
is
waiting
for
me
the
senator
turned
to
his
desk
bent
and
discouraged
i
suppose
i
should
have
taken
a
secretary
who
was
a
southerner
and
a
gentleman
well
randolph
you
have
to
act
now
take
this
letter
the
young
man
sat
down
and
took
the
following
from
the
diction
haines
sir
i
quite
understand
your
feelings
and
the
impossibility
of
your
continuing
in
my
employ
the
least
said
about
it
the
better
i
am
sorry
too
william
h
langdon
you
boys
run
away
i
got
to
think
said
the
senator
when
the
pair
had
gone
the
old
man
drew
the
letter
to
him
and
below
his
signature
he
added
a
postscript
do
forget
there
some
money
coming
to
you
walking
across
the
room
to
leave
he
sighed
he
was
making
the
best
kind
of
a
secretary
chapter
xvi
a
rescue
in
the
nick
of
time
later
in
that
day
bud
haines
ventured
back
to
his
desk
in
the
committee
room
after
first
ascertaining
that
senator
langdon
would
not
return
some
of
the
senator
papers
must
be
straightened
out
and
he
wanted
personal
documents
of
his
own
the
secretary
regretfully
sorrowfully
performed
these
final
duties
and
found
himself
stopping
at
various
intervals
to
try
to
explain
to
himself
how
he
had
been
deceived
in
both
the
langdons
father
and
daughter
he
had
to
give
up
both
problems
to
him
neither
was
explainable
i
known
enough
senators
to
know
that
i
never
meet
an
honest
one
he
muttered
but
as
to
women
well
there
too
much
carefully
selected
wisdom
in
their
innocence
to
suit
me
this
cynic
new
born
from
the
shell
of
the
chronic
idealist
that
was
suddenly
was
disturbed
in
his
ruminations
by
a
sound
at
the
door
looking
up
he
saw
hope
georgia
langdon
standing
shyly
embarrassed
in
the
main
entrance
haines
she
said
timidly
bud
jumped
to
his
feet
yes
miss
hope
georgia
as
the
senator
younger
daughter
came
toward
him
he
noticed
that
she
was
excited
over
something
and
for
a
newly
made
cynic
he
took
altogether
too
much
notice
of
her
youthful
beauty
her
fresh
rosy
complexion
and
her
dancing
sparkling
eyes
the
thought
occurred
to
him
what
a
woman
she
will
make
if
she
does
imitate
her
sister
i
could
let
you
go
haines
without
telling
you
and
letting
you
know
that
no
matter
what
the
others
say
i
do
think
there
has
been
anything
wrong
before
haines
could
reply
the
young
girl
rushed
on
excitedly
that
why
i
came
i
know
father
and
carolina
wo
like
it
they
wo
think
it
nice
but
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
that
i
do
think
one
ought
to
believe
things
against
one
you
liked
and
trusted
you
think
one
ought
not
said
haines
so
do
i
but
in
this
case
the
proofs
were
very
strong
what
are
you
going
to
do
when
people
you
ca
doubt
pledge
their
word
the
girl
tossed
her
head
well
the
only
one
word
i
like
to
take
would
be
the
person
accused
i
know
i
only
a
girl
haines
and
i
not
grown
up
but
you
made
a
mistake
do
try
to
clear
things
up
why
do
you
see
father
and
talk
with
him
please
do
mr
haines
little
realizing
that
the
girl
was
speaking
in
his
own
favor
for
he
knew
not
the
need
for
such
speaking
he
believed
her
to
be
defending
her
father
he
grasped
her
hands
impulsively
you
have
grown
up
very
much
since
you
came
to
the
capital
you
he
said
and
you
are
right
miss
hope
i
ought
to
have
known
even
when
the
facts
were
against
him
that
your
father
could
have
been
really
crooked
he
ca
be
hope
langdon
face
flushed
indignantly
father
crooked
who
said
so
who
dared
say
that
she
exclaimed
why
they
told
me
he
had
sold
out
on
the
altacoola
bill
they
said
he
was
trying
to
make
money
on
altacoola
that
why
i
quit
the
flame
of
anger
still
was
spread
on
the
girl
face
they
said
that
she
exclaimed
then
they
lied
they
said
you
were
the
crooked
one
why
father
thinks
you
sold
out
on
altacoola
they
said
you
were
trying
to
make
money
on
that
navy
yard
what
they
said
i
was
crooked
haines
fairly
shouted
he
rushed
around
the
desk
and
caught
the
girl
by
both
hands
i
see
it
he
cried
i
see
it
there
something
i
not
just
on
to
you
thought
it
was
i
your
father
thinks
of
course
exclaimed
hope
quite
as
excited
as
he
i
believe
it
that
why
i
came
back
to
get
you
to
explain
i
wanted
you
to
disprove
the
charge
i
should
say
i
would
cried
the
secretary
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
they
could
make
me
believe
anything
against
you
i
knew
you
were
all
i
thought
you
oh
haines
prove
you
are
that
for
my
then
hope
georgia
abruptly
stopped
she
had
lost
her
head
and
in
the
enthusiasm
of
the
moment
had
revealed
her
real
feelings
something
she
would
never
do
presumably
when
she
grew
more
wise
in
the
ways
of
women
she
suddenly
thrust
haines
hands
from
her
own
and
stood
staring
at
him
wondering
wondering
if
he
had
guessed
strangely
enough
under
the
circumstances
the
girl
was
the
first
to
recover
and
break
the
awkward
silence
come
to
our
house
haines
there
to
be
a
dinner
and
a
musicale
as
you
know
but
that
wo
matter
no
matter
who
says
no
i
promise
you
that
you
shall
see
father
there
shall
be
an
explanation
thank
you
miss
hope
you
do
realize
all
you
done
for
me
said
bud
seriously
it
a
wonderful
thing
to
find
a
girl
who
believes
in
a
man
you
taught
me
a
lot
miss
hope
thank
you
haines
come
she
said
as
she
turned
and
hurried
away
bud
haines
stood
looking
after
her
thoughtfully
what
a
stunning
girl
she
is
i
seemed
to
overlook
her
with
the
rush
of
events
and
carolina
he
murmured
softly
we
never
were
such
very
great
friends
yet
she
believes
in
me
what
a
beauty
she
is
a
messenger
boy
broke
in
on
his
musings
with
a
letter
for
senator
langdon
marked
important
guess
i
secretary
enough
yet
to
answer
this
he
thought
tearing
it
open
great
heavens
he
exclaimed
as
he
read
it
here
the
chance
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
altacoola
proposition
it
from
peabody
haines
read
the
following
dear
senator
langdon
i
am
going
to
philadelphia
urgent
call
from
a
company
for
which
i
am
counsel
so
i
probably
wo
be
able
to
confer
with
you
regarding
the
committee
choice
for
the
naval
base
but
i
know
you
are
for
altacoola
and
trust
to
you
to
do
all
you
can
for
that
site
i
of
course
consider
the
matter
definitely
settled
this
situation
will
enable
langdon
to
bluff
peabody
and
draw
out
of
him
all
the
inside
of
the
altacoola
business
ought
to
anyway
guess
some
gulf
city
talk
will
smoke
him
out
haines
rushed
out
and
across
the
hall
to
reappear
literally
hauling
in
a
stenographer
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
here
you
take
this
dictation
record
time
he
cried
senator
horatio
peabody
louis
napoleon
hotel
you
are
going
to
philadelphia
i
know
leaving
the
report
on
the
naval
base
to
me
i
have
just
come
on
various
aspects
of
the
situation
which
make
me
incline
very
favorably
toward
gulf
city
i
am
looking
into
the
matter
and
of
course
shall
act
according
to
my
best
judgment
that
is
what
you
will
want
me
to
do
i
know
sincerely
yours
william
h
langdon
i
do
think
senator
peabody
will
go
to
philadelphia
laughed
haines
grimly
as
he
addressed
the
envelope
and
i
think
that
when
the
of
the
senate
hurries
around
to
the
langdon
house
instead
there
will
be
more
than
one
kind
of
music
more
than
one
kind
of
food
eaten
perhaps
crow
before
the
evening
is
over
seizing
his
hat
bud
rushed
to
the
door
to
look
up
a
messenger
it
all
in
langdon
hands
now
he
cried
here
where
i
resign
my
position
as
united
states
senator
chapter
xvii
the
conspirators
outwitted
senator
langdon
dinners
had
well
won
popularity
in
washington
invitations
to
them
were
rarely
answered
by
the
sending
of
regrets
he
had
brought
his
old
mississippi
cook
from
the
plantation
whose
southern
dishes
had
caused
the
secretary
of
state
himself
to
make
the
senator
an
offer
for
the
chef
services
no
use
bidding
for
old
general
washington
said
the
senator
on
that
notable
occasion
he
would
leave
my
kitchen
sir
even
to
accept
the
presidency
itself
why
i
could
even
discharge
him
if
i
wanted
to
i
tried
to
let
him
go
once
sir
and
the
old
general
made
me
feel
so
ashamed
of
myself
that
i
actually
cried
sir
peabody
and
stevens
were
the
dinner
guests
as
they
were
to
confer
afterward
with
langdon
and
settle
on
the
action
of
the
naval
affairs
committee
regarding
the
naval
base
the
three
being
a
majority
could
control
the
action
of
the
committee
senator
peabody
had
finally
postponed
leaving
for
philadelphia
until
the
midnight
train
in
order
to
be
present
he
assured
langdon
as
the
trio
entered
the
library
the
girls
norton
and
randolph
were
left
to
oversee
preparations
for
the
prominent
washingtonians
invited
to
attend
the
musicale
to
be
given
later
in
the
evening
carolina
and
hope
georgia
were
in
distinctly
different
moods
the
elder
vivacious
elated
over
the
bright
outlook
for
her
future
the
younger
cast
down
and
wearing
a
worried
expression
norton
and
randolph
in
jubilant
spirit
tried
to
cheer
her
and
failing
resorted
to
taunts
about
some
imaginary
love
affair
the
courage
of
the
afternoon
which
had
enabled
her
to
speak
to
haines
as
she
had
was
gone
girlish
fears
now
swept
over
her
as
to
the
outcome
of
the
evening
haines
had
not
come
was
he
really
guilty
and
had
promised
to
come
merely
to
get
rid
of
her
why
was
he
late
if
he
did
come
would
she
be
able
to
have
her
father
see
him
as
she
had
promised
if
she
failed
and
she
might
she
would
never
see
this
young
man
again
if
i
looked
as
unhappy
as
you
hope
i
go
to
bed
and
not
discourage
our
guests
as
they
arrive
carolina
suggested
our
floral
decorations
alone
for
cost
and
the
musical
program
cost
over
the
most
fashionable
folks
in
washington
coming
what
more
could
you
want
hope
is
it
perfectly
glorious
why
haines
is
below
asking
to
see
senator
langdon
announced
a
servant
entering
oh
i
knew
he
come
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
cried
hope
georgia
in
pure
ecstasy
clapping
her
hands
the
three
plotters
turned
on
the
girl
in
amazement
then
they
stared
at
each
other
mr
haines
ejaculated
carolina
haines
exclaimed
randolph
hurriedly
leaving
the
room
haines
sneered
norton
we
can
take
care
of
him
the
senator
see
him
carolina
caught
the
suggestion
tell
haines
that
senator
langdon
regrets
that
he
can
not
possibly
receive
him
she
directed
carolina
there
was
a
ring
of
protest
and
pain
in
hope
georgia
voice
as
she
darted
out
of
the
door
after
the
servant
what
the
matter
with
that
girl
asked
norton
trying
to
be
calm
carolina
shook
her
head
i
do
know
she
queer
i
believe
she
imagines
herself
in
love
with
mr
haines
are
you
afraid
she
make
trouble
the
other
sister
laughed
confidently
little
hope
make
trouble
of
course
not
if
she
does
we
can
always
frighten
her
into
obedience
the
door
reopened
and
hope
entered
followed
by
bud
haines
the
head
was
high
her
cheeks
were
red
her
eyes
glittered
ominously
i
brought
him
back
carolina
she
said
coolly
father
will
want
to
see
him
i
know
there
has
been
some
mistake
yes
supplemented
bud
there
has
been
a
decided
mistake
and
i
must
refuse
to
accept
the
word
that
came
to
me
from
senator
langdon
carolina
langdon
drew
herself
up
in
her
most
dignified
manner
i
sorry
haines
but
you
must
accept
it
she
said
exactly
seconded
norton
senator
langdon
entirely
declines
to
receive
you
i
do
trust
anything
you
say
congressman
norton
and
i
may
say
also
that
i
recognize
no
right
of
yours
to
interfere
in
any
affair
between
me
and
the
langdon
family
perhaps
i
can
explain
my
right
haines
norton
said
coolly
stepping
beside
carolina
i
have
just
had
the
pleasure
of
announcing
to
miss
hope
georgia
langdon
my
engagement
to
miss
carolina
langdon
haines
entirely
unprepared
for
such
a
dénoûement
shot
a
searching
glance
at
carolina
she
bowed
her
head
in
affirmation
so
that
why
you
tried
to
ruin
me
he
cried
you
both
from
the
same
mold
turning
from
carolina
langdon
to
congressman
norton
then
back
to
the
girl
they
stood
facing
each
other
when
randolph
langdon
returned
at
sight
of
bud
haines
he
started
stopped
short
a
second
then
came
forward
quickly
haines
my
father
has
declared
that
he
will
not
see
you
and
either
you
leave
this
house
at
once
or
i
shall
call
the
servants
bud
looked
at
young
langdon
contemptuously
yes
i
think
you
would
need
some
help
he
sneered
feeling
in
his
veins
the
rush
of
red
blood
the
determination
in
his
heart
that
had
a
few
years
back
carried
him
through
eighty
yards
of
struggling
yale
football
players
to
a
touchdown
the
senator
son
drew
back
his
arm
but
the
confident
look
of
the
new
yorker
restrained
him
haines
in
the
south
gentlemen
do
not
make
scenes
of
violence
before
ladies
the
cold
rebuke
of
carolina
cut
into
the
silence
haines
stood
in
perplexity
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
or
how
to
get
to
the
senator
it
was
hope
who
came
to
his
rescue
i
tell
father
you
are
here
i
make
him
come
haines
he
shall
see
you
with
the
air
of
a
defiant
little
princess
she
started
for
the
door
hope
i
forbid
you
doing
any
such
thing
exclaimed
her
older
sister
but
the
younger
girl
paid
no
attention
randolph
caught
her
arm
you
shall
not
hope
he
cried
hope
georgia
struggled
and
pulled
her
arm
free
i
reckon
i
just
got
to
do
what
seems
right
to
me
randolph
she
exclaimed
i
reckon
i
grown
up
and
i
tell
you
i
tell
all
of
you
she
whirled
and
faced
them
there
something
wrong
here
and
father
is
going
to
see
haines
and
they
are
going
to
settle
it
norton
alone
was
equal
to
the
situation
temporarily
at
least
i
be
fair
with
you
hope
he
said
reassuringly
and
she
stopped
in
her
flight
to
the
hall
door
i
take
carolina
and
randolph
in
to
see
the
senator
and
we
tell
him
haines
is
here
perhaps
we
had
better
tell
the
senator
norton
suggested
beckoning
to
carolina
and
her
brother
let
haines
wait
here
and
we
will
make
the
situation
clear
to
the
senator
you
better
make
it
very
clear
exclaimed
the
younger
girl
for
i
going
to
stay
here
with
haines
until
he
has
seen
father
the
guilty
trio
fearful
of
this
new
and
unexplainable
activity
of
hope
georgia
slowly
departed
in
search
of
senator
langdon
to
make
a
last
desperate
attempt
to
prevent
him
from
meeting
this
pestilential
secretary
that
was
and
might
be
again
when
the
door
closed
after
them
hope
came
down
to
the
table
where
bud
haines
was
standing
wo
you
sit
down
mr
haines
she
said
i
i
try
to
entertain
you
until
father
comes
she
said
weakly
realizing
that
again
she
was
alone
with
the
man
she
loved
chapter
xviii
hope
langdon
hour
of
triumph
haines
sat
at
a
table
in
the
across
from
hope
georgia
and
his
gratitude
for
her
battle
in
his
favor
mingled
with
a
realization
of
qualities
in
this
young
lady
that
he
had
never
before
noticed
probably
he
did
not
know
that
what
he
had
really
seen
in
her
that
day
and
that
evening
was
the
sudden
transition
from
girlhood
to
womanhood
her
casting
aside
of
thoughtless
irresponsive
youth
and
the
shouldering
of
the
responsibilities
of
the
grown
woman
who
would
do
her
share
in
the
world
work
he
stared
across
in
astonishment
at
this
slip
of
a
girl
who
had
outwitted
two
resourceful
men
and
an
older
sister
of
unquestioned
ability
i
do
not
recognize
you
miss
hope
he
said
finally
perhaps
you
never
looked
at
me
before
she
suggested
archly
feeling
instinctively
that
this
was
her
hour
that
the
man
she
loved
was
at
this
moment
thinking
more
about
her
than
of
anything
else
in
the
world
haines
made
a
gesture
of
regret
that
must
be
it
he
agreed
then
he
leaned
forward
eagerly
but
looking
at
you
now
and
i
like
looking
at
you
i
like
what
you
done
for
me
oh
that
was
nothing
haines
she
exclaimed
airily
her
intuition
telling
her
of
her
sway
over
the
man
nothing
he
exclaimed
well
it
more
than
any
one
ever
did
for
me
before
i
known
lots
of
girls
i
do
doubt
that
haines
hope
interjected
with
a
light
laugh
yes
i
say
i
known
lots
of
girls
but
there
never
been
one
who
showed
herself
such
a
true
friend
as
you
have
been
there
never
been
any
one
who
believed
in
me
this
way
when
i
was
practically
down
and
out
perhaps
you
never
been
down
and
out
before
haines
so
they
never
had
a
chance
to
show
whether
they
believed
in
you
or
not
that
may
be
one
reason
he
answered
i
wonder
why
he
paused
i
wonder
why
your
sister
carolina
did
not
believe
in
me
you
were
quite
fond
of
her
were
you
the
girl
began
then
stopped
and
turned
away
her
head
haines
gazed
curiously
at
hope
i
was
yes
i
even
thought
i
loved
her
but
i
soon
saw
my
mistake
it
was
love
it
was
only
a
kind
of
suddenly
pausing
bud
haines
shot
a
swift
glance
at
the
girl
what
wonderful
hair
you
have
miss
hope
the
girl
smiled
invitingly
think
so
yes
he
declared
earnestly
i
know
so
i
never
noticed
it
before
but
i
guess
lots
of
fellows
down
in
mississippi
have
hope
tantalizing
smile
worried
him
i
hope
you
are
not
secretly
engaged
too
he
exclaimed
no
oh
no
she
answered
quickly
before
she
thought
or
in
love
he
asked
seriously
haines
had
stood
up
and
was
now
leaning
intently
over
the
table
he
realized
the
difference
between
the
feeling
he
had
had
for
carolina
and
the
tender
emotion
that
thrilled
him
as
he
thought
of
the
sweet
girl
before
him
this
time
he
knew
he
was
not
mistaken
he
knew
that
he
truly
loved
hope
langdon
or
in
love
he
asked
again
anxious
at
her
silence
hope
looked
at
him
slowly
a
faint
blush
illumined
her
face
oh
do
let
talk
about
me
she
exclaimed
but
i
want
to
talk
about
you
he
cried
i
do
want
to
talk
about
anything
else
i
must
talk
about
you
and
i
going
to
talk
whether
you
want
to
hear
or
not
you
believed
in
me
when
nobody
else
believed
you
fought
for
me
when
everybody
else
was
fighting
against
me
you
shown
that
you
think
i
am
honest
and
worthy
of
a
woman
faith
you
fought
your
own
family
for
me
nobody
has
ever
done
for
me
what
you
have
and
and
he
faltered
full
of
what
he
was
about
to
say
and
you
grateful
she
ended
he
looked
her
squarely
in
the
eyes
as
though
to
fathom
her
thoughts
then
he
reached
toward
the
girl
and
seized
both
her
hands
grateful
nothing
he
cried
i
not
grateful
i
in
love
in
love
with
you
i
want
you
want
you
as
i
never
wanted
anything
or
anybody
before
and
i
tell
you
i
going
to
have
you
do
you
hear
hope
could
not
hide
her
agitation
the
light
in
her
eyes
showed
she
was
all
a
woman
illustration
the
langdon
family
oh
nothing
in
the
world
could
happen
as
quickly
as
that
mr
haines
she
protested
with
her
last
attempt
at
archness
nothing
could
he
threatened
i
show
you
he
advanced
quickly
around
the
table
but
the
girl
darted
just
beyond
his
grasp
then
she
paused
and
her
lover
gathered
her
in
his
arms
hope
my
dear
you
are
my
own
was
all
he
could
say
as
he
bent
over
to
kiss
the
lips
that
were
not
refused
to
him
hope
released
herself
from
his
fervent
grasp
i
love
you
i
do
love
you
she
said
fondly
i
believe
in
you
and
father
must
too
you
got
to
straighten
this
tangle
out
now
for
my
sake
as
well
as
your
own
father
will
listen
it
all
so
strange
so
wonderful
i
can
hardly
understand
it
began
haines
slowly
as
he
held
the
girl
hands
unknown
to
both
the
door
leading
from
the
hall
had
opened
to
admit
senator
langdon
into
the
lower
end
of
the
room
surprised
at
the
sight
of
the
couple
so
seriously
intent
on
each
other
he
made
a
sudden
gesture
of
anger
then
apparently
changing
his
mind
advanced
toward
them
i
believe
you
want
to
see
me
sir
he
said
to
haines
i
hope
be
brief
i
have
very
little
time
to
spare
from
my
guests
hope
bosom
fluttered
timorously
at
the
interruption
the
man
nervously
stepped
forward
i
take
much
of
your
time
senator
langdon
he
said
there
has
been
a
misunderstanding
a
terrible
mistake
i
am
sure
i
can
convince
you
senator
langdon
hesitated
doubtfully
half
turned
toward
carolina
randolph
and
norton
who
had
followed
him
and
again
faced
haines
hope
pressed
her
father
arm
and
looked
up
into
his
face
entreatingly
randolph
observing
this
quickly
stepped
close
to
the
senator
side
saying
i
can
settle
with
this
haines
for
you
waving
his
son
aside
the
senator
finally
spoke
i
reckon
there
been
too
many
attending
to
my
business
and
settling
my
affairs
randolph
he
said
i
think
for
a
change
i
settle
a
few
of
my
own
all
of
you
children
go
out
and
leave
me
here
with
mr
haines
chapter
xix
senator
langdon
learns
the
truth
when
they
were
alone
haines
faced
the
senator
and
spoke
determinedly
they
told
you
i
was
not
running
straight
he
said
the
senator
nodded
and
the
lines
about
his
mouth
deepened
yes
bud
haines
stiffened
at
the
word
every
muscle
in
his
body
seemed
to
become
rigid
as
he
mentally
vowed
that
he
would
retaliate
against
his
traducers
if
it
cost
him
his
life
to
do
it
hope
had
informed
him
only
too
accurately
he
now
realized
little
did
the
senator
know
that
what
he
was
now
about
to
hear
would
give
him
one
of
the
severest
shocks
of
his
life
they
told
me
you
were
running
straight
said
haines
deliberately
now
neither
one
of
us
has
been
crooked
but
somebody
else
has
been
and
this
was
the
plan
to
keep
us
apart
norton
told
me
you
were
speculating
in
altacoola
lands
said
langdon
and
norton
told
me
the
same
of
you
retorted
bud
the
senator
face
grew
very
serious
but
my
daughter
miss
carolina
langdon
confirmed
norton
story
haines
here
faced
the
most
difficult
part
of
his
interview
he
hardly
knew
how
to
answer
his
manhood
rebelled
against
placing
any
blame
on
a
woman
he
revolted
at
the
thought
of
ruining
a
father
faith
in
his
daughter
honesty
especially
when
that
father
was
the
man
he
most
admired
a
man
for
whom
he
had
genuine
affection
but
it
was
necessary
that
the
words
be
spoken
i
hate
to
tell
you
sir
he
said
in
a
low
uncertain
voice
that
it
was
your
daughter
carolina
who
made
me
believe
this
story
told
about
you
and
vouched
for
by
your
son
randolph
langdon
started
back
aghast
he
stared
at
haines
and
knew
that
he
spoke
the
truth
then
his
white
head
sank
pathetically
tears
welled
into
the
eyes
of
the
planter
and
this
sturdy
old
fighting
man
dropped
weakly
into
a
chair
sobbing
convulsively
broken
in
spirit
and
wearied
in
body
at
length
haines
spoke
to
his
stricken
chief
i
know
it
hurts
he
said
it
hurt
me
to
have
to
say
it
believe
it
until
you
get
it
out
of
norton
but
then
you
must
do
something
langdon
came
to
his
feet
mopping
his
cheeks
but
there
was
no
weakness
in
him
now
yes
he
would
do
something
he
would
go
after
the
thieves
that
had
turned
his
own
flesh
and
blood
against
him
and
root
them
all
out
show
them
all
up
oh
i
do
something
he
said
grimly
i
going
to
make
up
for
lost
time
of
course
norton
is
speculating
who
behind
him
stevens
and
peabody
i
positive
answered
haines
and
behind
them
is
standard
steel
what
exclaimed
langdon
stevens
in
a
swindle
like
this
are
you
sure
how
do
you
know
a
gulf
city
man
who
could
carry
his
liquor
gave
me
some
clues
and
i
worked
norton
into
telling
some
more
answered
the
secretary
where
is
peabody
he
here
now
then
he
has
got
my
letter
yet
i
sent
him
a
note
and
signed
your
name
senator
to
the
effect
that
the
gulf
city
claims
have
been
brought
before
you
so
strongly
that
you
might
vote
for
gulf
city
langdon
was
amazed
you
sent
that
note
he
exclaimed
when
you
know
altacoola
is
the
only
proper
place
and
gulf
city
is
a
mud
bank
the
newspaper
man
smiled
of
course
he
agreed
but
i
had
to
get
a
rise
out
of
peabody
this
will
show
where
he
stands
oh
said
langdon
i
understand
thanks
boy
a
servant
entered
with
a
note
for
senator
peabody
sir
marked
the
messenger
been
hunting
him
for
some
hours
langdon
looked
shrewdly
at
bud
then
turned
to
the
servant
you
keep
that
note
until
i
ring
for
you
then
bring
it
to
senator
peabody
understand
no
matter
how
urgent
it
marked
the
man
bowed
yes
sir
now
tell
norton
miss
langdon
and
randolph
to
come
here
the
senator
turned
back
to
his
secretary
i
expect
i
going
to
be
pretty
busy
the
rest
of
the
evening
bud
so
in
case
i
forget
to
mention
it
again
remember
to
show
up
at
your
old
desk
in
the
morning
i
will
thank
you
sir
you
sent
for
us
senator
said
norton
approaching
with
his
two
dupes
you
are
interested
in
altacoola
lands
the
senator
angrily
charged
i
am
sir
he
said
and
you
told
haines
that
i
was
interested
in
altacoola
lands
the
schemer
hesitated
and
the
senator
broke
in
on
him
in
rage
speak
out
man
tell
the
truth
if
you
can
i
did
admitted
the
congressman
finally
was
there
any
particular
reason
for
your
not
telling
the
truth
demanded
the
mississippian
in
threatening
tone
i
told
the
truth
replied
norton
you
are
interested
in
them
for
an
instant
langdon
seemed
about
to
step
toward
him
then
he
controlled
himself
i
did
know
it
he
said
you
have
several
things
to
learn
senator
declared
the
congressman
i
have
things
to
learn
and
things
to
teach
he
said
but
go
on
why
am
i
interested
you
are
interested
senator
replied
the
trickster
making
his
big
play
through
your
son
randolph
who
invested
of
your
money
in
altacoola
and
also
through
your
daughter
miss
carolina
who
acting
on
my
advice
has
put
her
own
money
in
altacoola
land
also
for
a
moment
langdon
was
speechless
it
was
too
much
at
first
for
the
honest
old
southerner
to
comprehend
you
mean
he
gasped
at
last
that
you
induce
a
boy
to
put
in
altacoola
land
when
you
knew
i
had
to
vote
on
the
bill
and
you
even
let
my
daughter
put
her
money
in
the
same
scheme
of
course
i
did
it
was
a
splendid
chance
and
i
let
your
son
in
for
friendship
and
your
daughter
because
she
has
done
me
the
honor
to
promise
to
become
my
wife
what
you
have
my
daughter
promise
to
marry
you
you
she
admits
it
herself
then
i
reckon
here
where
i
lose
a
prospective
sneered
langdon
but
that
unimportant
now
norton
who
behind
you
i
must
decline
to
answer
that
langdon
looked
at
him
sternly
very
well
he
said
you
are
too
small
to
count
i
find
out
for
myself
now
you
go
to
my
study
and
wait
there
until
i
send
for
you
i
must
be
alone
with
my
children
when
norton
and
haines
had
left
them
langdon
turned
sadly
to
the
two
children
who
had
disgraced
him
can
you
understand
he
said
do
you
know
what
you
done
to
me
what
father
we
done
nothing
wrong
protested
carolina
they
told
me
it
was
perfectly
legitimate
urged
randolph
they
said
everybody
peabody
and
stevens
and
the
rest
were
in
it
and
peabody
is
the
boss
of
the
senate
yes
my
boy
assented
the
old
planter
he
the
leader
in
the
senate
and
that
the
shameful
part
of
all
this
that
a
man
of
his
high
standing
should
set
you
so
miserable
an
example
randolph
langdon
was
not
a
vicious
lad
not
a
youth
who
preferred
or
chose
wrongdoing
for
the
increased
rewards
it
offered
he
was
at
heart
a
chivalrous
straightforward
trustful
southern
boy
who
believed
in
the
splendid
traditions
of
his
family
and
loved
his
father
as
a
son
should
a
parent
having
the
qualities
of
the
old
hero
of
crawfordsville
jealous
of
his
honor
he
had
been
a
victim
of
wiles
because
of
the
congressman
position
and
persuasiveness
because
this
companion
of
his
young
days
had
won
his
confidence
and
had
not
hesitated
to
distort
the
lad
idea
of
what
was
right
and
what
was
wrong
randolph
began
an
indignant
protest
against
his
father
reproof
when
the
senator
cut
him
short
do
you
see
said
the
senator
i
can
understand
there
being
rascals
in
the
outside
world
and
that
they
should
believe
your
careless
foolish
old
father
lawful
game
but
that
he
should
be
thought
a
tool
for
dishonest
thieving
by
members
of
his
own
family
is
incomprehensible
randolph
my
son
carolina
my
daughter
through
all
their
generations
the
langdons
have
been
honorable
your
mother
was
a
randolph
and
this
from
you
oh
carolina
and
you
randolph
how
could
you
how
could
you
betray
or
seek
to
betray
your
father
who
sees
in
you
the
image
of
your
dear
mother
who
has
gone
chapter
xx
the
call
to
arms
both
randolph
and
carolina
were
deeply
affected
by
their
words
the
daughter
attempted
to
take
on
herself
the
blame
for
her
action
i
was
the
older
one
i
might
have
stopped
him
if
i
had
wished
and
should
bear
the
burden
no
no
father
exclaimed
the
youth
his
inborn
prompting
him
to
shoulder
the
consequences
of
his
own
mistakes
i
and
i
alone
am
responsible
for
what
i
did
i
did
not
realize
that
it
was
wrong
i
will
not
hide
behind
carolina
carolina
langdon
bore
herself
better
than
was
to
have
been
expected
under
the
strain
of
the
painful
interview
she
saw
more
clearly
now
how
she
had
erred
she
was
undergoing
an
inward
revolution
that
would
make
it
impossible
for
her
ever
again
to
veer
so
far
from
the
line
of
duty
to
her
father
her
family
and
to
herself
when
randolph
had
finished
carolina
took
up
her
own
defense
and
eloquently
she
pleaded
the
defense
of
many
a
woman
who
yearns
for
what
she
has
not
got
for
what
may
be
beyond
her
reach
the
defense
of
the
woman
who
chafes
under
the
limitations
of
worldly
position
of
sex
and
of
opportunity
it
was
the
defense
of
an
ambitious
woman
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
been
a
man
of
the
langdon
family
she
exclaimed
father
oh
ca
you
understand
that
i
could
doze
my
life
away
down
on
those
plantations
you
do
know
what
ambition
is
i
had
to
have
the
world
i
had
to
have
money
if
i
had
been
a
man
i
would
have
tried
big
financial
enterprises
i
should
have
liked
to
fight
for
a
fortune
you
would
have
condemned
me
then
you
might
have
said
my
methods
were
bold
but
if
i
succeeded
i
would
have
been
a
great
man
but
just
because
i
am
a
woman
you
think
i
must
sit
home
with
my
knitting
no
father
the
world
does
move
women
must
have
an
equal
chance
with
men
but
i
wish
i
had
been
a
man
even
then
i
hope
you
would
have
been
a
gentleman
rebuked
her
father
sternly
women
should
have
an
equal
chance
carolina
they
should
have
an
equal
chance
for
the
same
virtues
as
men
not
for
the
same
vices
but
an
equal
chance
returned
the
girl
fervidly
there
father
you
have
admitted
what
i
have
tried
to
prove
the
woman
with
the
spirit
of
a
man
the
spirit
that
cries
to
a
woman
something
for
yourself
can
not
sit
idly
by
while
all
the
world
moves
on
if
it
is
true
that
i
have
chosen
the
wrong
means
the
wrong
way
to
better
my
lot
i
did
it
through
ignorance
and
that
ignorance
is
the
fault
of
the
times
in
which
i
live
of
the
system
that
guides
the
era
in
which
i
live
i
am
what
the
world
calls
but
the
world
the
world
of
men
knows
better
it
laughs
at
me
it
has
cheated
me
because
i
am
a
woman
the
world
of
men
has
fenced
me
in
and
hobbled
me
with
convention
with
precedent
with
fictitious
sentiment
if
i
pursue
the
business
of
men
as
they
themselves
would
pursue
it
i
am
called
an
ungrateful
daughter
if
i
should
adopt
the
morals
of
men
i
would
be
called
a
fallen
woman
if
i
adopted
the
religion
of
men
i
would
have
no
religion
at
all
turn
what
way
i
will
illustration
you
have
to
take
your
medicine
like
a
man
but
not
every
woman
feels
the
way
you
do
my
daughter
broke
in
the
senator
no
you
are
right
because
their
spirit
has
been
crushed
by
generations
by
centuries
of
forced
subserviency
to
men
they
tell
us
we
should
be
thankful
that
we
do
not
live
in
china
where
women
are
physical
slaves
to
men
in
our
country
they
are
forced
to
be
mental
and
social
slaves
to
men
is
one
very
much
worse
than
the
other
then
dear
and
her
father
tone
was
very
gentle
if
you
want
an
equal
chance
want
to
be
equal
to
a
man
you
must
take
your
medicine
with
randolph
like
a
man
what
are
you
going
to
do
sir
she
asked
afraid
i
going
to
spoil
all
your
little
scheme
dear
he
returned
smiling
sadly
i
going
i
fear
to
make
you
lose
all
your
money
i
like
to
make
it
easy
for
you
but
i
ca
you
got
to
take
your
medicine
children
and
when
it
all
over
back
there
in
mississippi
i
shall
be
able
i
hope
to
patch
up
your
broken
lives
and
together
we
will
work
out
your
mistakes
i
ca
think
of
that
now
the
honor
of
the
langdons
calls
this
is
the
time
for
the
fight
and
any
one
who
fights
against
me
must
take
the
consequences
he
walked
over
and
touched
the
bell
thomas
he
said
to
the
servant
who
responded
take
that
letter
at
once
to
senator
peabody
in
the
library
what
is
it
sir
asked
randolph
it
the
call
to
arms
responded
his
father
grimly
senator
peabody
read
the
letter
to
which
haines
had
signed
name
and
jumped
up
from
his
chair
in
the
library
in
astonishment
without
a
word
to
the
startled
stevens
he
rushed
to
confront
langdon
what
the
meaning
of
this
he
shouted
as
he
burst
in
on
the
junior
senator
from
mississippi
of
what
asked
the
southerner
with
a
blandness
that
added
fuel
to
peabody
irritation
do
trifle
with
me
sir
cried
the
boss
of
the
senate
this
letter
you
sent
it
explain
it
i
in
no
mood
to
joke
langdon
looked
at
him
calmly
i
think
the
letter
is
quite
plain
senator
he
said
you
can
read
then
he
turned
to
his
daughter
this
discussion
can
not
possibly
interest
you
my
dear
will
you
go
to
the
to
receive
our
guests
carolina
obeyed
she
seemed
to
be
discovering
new
qualities
in
this
father
whom
she
had
considered
to
be
too
for
his
time
now
senator
go
ahead
and
randolph
you
bring
stevens
you
switching
to
gulf
city
demanded
peabody
i
considering
gulf
city
agreed
langdon
peabody
brought
down
his
fist
on
the
table
it
too
late
to
consider
anything
langdon
he
cried
committed
to
altacoola
and
altacoola
it
is
i
do
care
what
you
heard
of
gulf
city
now
i
like
to
settle
this
thing
in
a
friendly
manner
langdon
i
like
always
for
every
member
of
the
senate
to
have
his
share
of
the
power
and
the
patronage
we
been
glad
to
put
you
forward
in
this
naval
base
matter
we
appreciate
the
straightforwardness
the
honesty
of
your
character
you
look
well
you
the
kind
of
politician
the
public
thinks
it
wants
nowadays
but
you
been
in
the
senate
long
enough
to
know
that
bills
have
to
pass
and
you
know
you
ca
get
through
anything
without
my
friends
and
i
tell
you
now
i
throttle
any
gulf
city
plan
you
bring
up
then
if
you
are
as
sure
of
that
you
ca
object
to
my
being
for
gulf
city
asked
langdon
are
you
financially
interested
in
gulf
city
demanded
peabody
senator
peabody
exclaimed
langdon
do
flare
up
langdon
retorted
peabody
that
sort
of
thing
has
happened
in
the
senate
there
are
often
perfectly
legitimate
profits
to
be
made
in
some
regular
commercial
venture
by
a
man
who
has
inside
information
as
to
what
doing
up
on
capitol
hill
senator
peabody
asked
langdon
why
are
you
so
strong
for
altacoola
the
pennsylvanian
hesitated
its
natural
advantages
he
said
at
last
the
southerner
shook
his
head
oh
that
all
well
if
natural
advantages
are
going
to
settle
it
and
not
influence
go
ahead
and
vote
and
i
just
bring
in
a
minority
report
for
gulf
city
the
boss
of
the
senate
was
in
a
corner
now
confound
it
langdon
if
you
will
have
it
i
am
interested
in
altacoola
langdon
nodded
that
all
i
wanted
to
know
he
said
now
you
see
why
it
got
to
be
altacoola
persisted
the
boss
i
do
mind
telling
you
then
senator
peabody
answered
langdon
calmly
that
my
being
for
gulf
city
was
a
bluff
i
been
trying
to
draw
you
out
gulf
city
is
a
mud
bank
and
no
more
fitted
to
be
a
naval
base
than
keokuk
ia
altacoola
it
got
to
be
for
the
good
of
the
country
and
the
honor
of
mississippi
and
one
thing
more
senator
i
just
like
to
add
that
not
a
single
man
connected
with
that
committee
is
going
to
make
a
cent
out
of
the
deal
you
get
that
straight
chapter
xxi
if
you
ca
buy
a
senator
threaten
him
senator
peabody
was
the
most
surprised
man
in
washington
when
he
heard
the
junior
senator
from
mississippi
state
that
no
one
was
to
enrich
himself
out
of
the
government
naval
base
project
he
heaped
a
mental
anathema
on
the
head
of
stevens
for
saddling
such
a
man
on
the
senate
machine
for
langdon
would
of
course
never
had
been
put
on
naval
affairs
just
now
very
important
to
the
machine
without
the
of
stevens
who
had
won
a
heretofore
thoroughly
reliable
reputation
as
a
judge
of
men
or
of
what
purported
to
be
men
the
thought
that
at
this
time
of
all
times
there
should
be
a
man
on
the
committee
on
naval
affairs
that
could
not
be
handled
was
sufficient
to
make
him
who
reveled
in
the
title
of
boss
of
the
senate
determine
that
he
must
get
another
chief
lieutenant
to
replace
stevens
who
had
proved
so
trustworthy
in
the
past
stevens
had
lost
his
cunning
as
the
vote
of
langdon
could
not
be
secured
by
humbug
or
in
exchange
for
favors
and
as
it
could
not
be
delivered
peabody
of
course
was
willing
to
pay
in
actual
cash
for
the
vote
this
was
the
final
step
but
one
in
political
conspiracies
of
this
nature
cash
but
langdon
would
not
take
cash
so
peabody
had
to
resort
to
the
last
agency
of
the
trained
and
corrupt
manipulator
of
legislation
he
would
threaten
moreover
he
knew
that
to
make
threats
effective
if
it
is
possible
to
do
so
they
must
be
led
up
to
systematically
that
is
they
should
be
made
at
the
right
time
the
scene
must
be
set
as
in
a
play
senator
peabody
glared
at
langdon
as
though
to
convince
the
latter
that
to
stand
in
his
way
would
mean
political
destruction
so
nobody
is
going
to
make
a
cent
eh
well
i
suppose
you
want
all
the
profits
for
yourself
turning
to
stevens
who
had
just
entered
the
pennsylvanian
cried
do
you
but
listen
to
our
suddenly
good
friend
langdon
he
wants
to
be
the
only
man
to
make
money
out
of
the
naval
base
he
wo
listen
to
any
other
member
of
the
naval
committee
making
a
cent
out
of
it
why
he
great
god
sir
exclaimed
langdon
you
are
going
too
far
peabody
you
state
what
is
false
and
you
know
it
you
you
then
you
are
willing
that
others
should
have
their
rightful
share
put
in
stevens
oh
i
understand
now
senator
no
no
no
cried
langdon
you
do
not
understand
senator
stevens
and
i
must
say
i
am
ashamed
to
speak
of
you
by
the
honorable
title
of
senator
sir
i
will
not
listen
to
any
person
enriching
himself
at
the
government
expense
and
i
am
your
enemy
you
peabody
and
you
stevens
beyond
recall
you
both
know
you
misrepresent
me
langdon
walked
over
to
stevens
and
faced
him
do
you
remember
stevens
lorimer
hawkslee
back
in
wartime
yes
said
stevens
puzzled
i
remember
him
a
very
fine
gentleman
the
old
planter
sneered
yes
a
very
fine
gentleman
you
remember
he
got
rich
out
of
contracts
for
supplies
furnished
to
the
confederate
government
when
it
any
too
easy
for
the
confederate
government
to
pay
and
when
he
was
in
that
government
himself
i
never
quite
thought
that
the
act
of
a
gentleman
stevens
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
very
like
dishonesty
i
refused
to
speak
to
lorimer
hawkslee
in
the
carroll
hotel
at
vicksburg
and
when
the
people
there
asked
me
why
i
told
them
i
want
to
warn
you
stevens
that
i
likely
to
meet
you
some
time
in
the
carroll
hotel
at
vicksburg
stevens
backed
away
angrily
i
catch
your
insinuation
but
he
received
a
warning
glance
from
peabody
and
broke
into
a
pleasant
smile
calculated
to
deceive
the
old
planter
this
once
i
will
overlook
it
because
of
our
old
friendship
and
the
old
days
in
mississippi
you
are
a
fine
talker
langdon
said
peabody
coming
to
rescue
but
i
can
readily
see
what
you
are
driving
at
you
want
an
investigation
you
think
you
will
catch
some
of
us
with
what
you
reformers
call
goods
but
forget
evidently
the
entirely
simple
facts
that
your
family
has
invested
in
altacoola
lands
more
heavily
probably
than
any
one
else
among
us
you
want
to
raise
a
scandal
do
you
well
go
on
and
raise
it
but
remember
that
you
will
have
to
explain
how
it
happened
that
there
is
invested
in
the
name
of
your
son
and
in
the
name
of
your
daughter
miss
carolina
not
to
mention
a
few
thousands
put
in
by
the
gentleman
who
i
am
given
to
understand
is
to
be
your
congressman
norton
how
about
that
norton
peabody
asked
turning
to
the
congressman
who
had
followed
stevens
i
corroborate
all
you
said
remarked
norton
i
can
state
positively
that
senator
langdon
knew
that
his
money
was
going
into
altacoola
land
i
will
swear
to
it
if
necessary
and
he
glared
bitterly
at
carolina
father
feeling
certain
that
the
girl
would
cling
to
him
as
opposed
to
her
parent
langdon
made
a
threatening
move
at
the
congressman
i
consider
my
riddance
of
you
mighty
cheap
at
the
price
he
cried
come
come
langdon
fumed
peabody
i
must
get
away
from
here
to
catch
the
midnight
train
let
get
through
with
this
matter
you
must
realize
that
you
can
not
fight
me
in
washington
you
must
know
that
men
call
me
the
of
the
senate
i
can
beat
any
measure
you
introduce
i
can
pass
any
measure
you
want
passed
i
can
make
you
a
or
a
power
why
my
friend
from
mississippi
i
can
even
have
your
election
to
the
senate
contested
have
a
committee
appointed
to
investigate
the
manner
of
your
election
have
that
committee
decide
that
you
bought
your
way
into
the
honorable
body
the
senate
of
the
united
states
and
on
the
strength
of
that
decision
have
you
forfeit
your
seat
what
a
pretty
heritage
to
hand
down
to
posterity
such
a
disgrace
will
be
why
the
very
school
children
of
the
future
will
hear
about
you
as
langdon
and
their
parents
will
tell
them
how
particularly
degrading
it
was
for
a
man
of
your
reputation
to
drag
into
your
dishonest
schemes
your
son
sir
and
your
daughter
for
who
will
believe
that
this
money
was
not
put
in
these
lands
without
your
consent
without
your
direction
your
order
did
you
not
sign
the
mortgage
on
which
this
was
raised
senator
langdon
waved
his
hand
deprecatingly
i
learning
the
ways
of
you
professional
politicians
i
getting
wise
i
learning
game
so
i
know
you
bluffing
me
peabody
but
you
forget
that
the
game
of
poker
was
invented
in
mississippi
my
native
state
pressing
a
button
langdon
summoned
a
servant
and
said
send
in
haines
i
guess
i
got
to
have
a
witness
for
my
side
it
no
bluff
spoke
stevens
as
haines
entered
peabody
can
and
will
break
you
like
a
pipestem
he
done
it
to
other
men
before
you
who
who
tried
to
dispute
his
power
but
i
try
to
save
you
ask
him
to
be
merciful
you
are
not
of
any
importance
in
the
senate
we
do
not
need
to
deal
with
you
then
why
do
you
both
spend
so
much
time
on
me
asked
langdon
innocently
why
does
peabody
go
to
philadelphia
langdon
said
peabody
you
know
my
control
of
the
senate
is
no
piece
of
fiction
but
i
will
forgive
your
obstinacy
even
forget
it
i
look
here
cried
langdon
just
because
i
a
fat
man
do
think
that
i
ca
lose
my
temper
he
stopped
and
gazed
at
his
two
colleagues
now
you
two
men
stay
still
one
moment
and
i
tell
you
what
really
will
happen
he
exploded
and
i
only
a
beginner
in
the
game
that
your
specialty
the
naval
base
is
going
to
altacoola
good
simultaneously
cried
both
peabody
and
stevens
you
coming
in
with
us
no
i
not
but
i
pass
the
bill
so
that
nobody
makes
a
cent
just
as
i
said
i
would
i
fool
you
both
and
make
you
both
honest
for
once
in
spite
of
your
natural
dispositions
stevens
and
the
pennsylvanian
stared
at
each
other
in
disgust
furthermore
continued
langdon
altacoola
must
have
the
base
because
i
known
for
some
time
that
gulf
city
was
impossible
but
some
crooked
senators
would
have
made
money
if
they
known
it
so
they
did
learn
it
altacoola
that
proud
arm
of
our
great
gulf
will
have
those
battleships
floating
on
her
broad
bosom
and
the
country
will
be
the
better
off
and
so
will
the
sovereign
state
of
mississippi
god
bless
it
but
neither
senator
peabody
of
pennsylvania
nor
senator
stevens
of
mississippi
is
going
to
be
any
better
because
of
it
no
and
if
you
men
come
to
my
committee
room
at
noon
you
have
a
chance
to
hear
how
all
that
coming
about
if
you
are
not
there
by
that
time
i
bring
in
a
minority
report
in
favor
of
gulf
city
just
to
show
you
that
i
know
how
to
play
the
game
this
washington
game
come
let
go
we
can
do
nothing
with
him
said
peabody
to
the
senior
senator
from
mississippi
well
senator
in
the
name
of
goodness
what
are
you
going
to
do
how
can
you
win
for
altacoola
without
letting
these
grafters
make
money
out
of
it
asked
haines
in
astonishment
as
the
other
two
walked
away
what
are
you
going
to
do
at
langdon
turned
to
him
and
rolled
his
eyes
toward
the
ceiling
despairingly
i
blamed
if
i
know
he
exclaimed
illustration
at
chapter
xxii
lobbyists
and
one
in
particular
washington
has
known
many
lobbyists
in
its
time
and
it
keeps
on
knowing
them
the
striking
increase
in
legislation
that
aims
to
restrict
unlawful
or
improper
practices
in
business
the
awakening
of
the
public
conscience
has
caused
a
greater
demand
than
ever
for
influence
at
the
national
capital
for
these
restrictive
measures
must
be
either
killed
or
emasculated
to
a
point
of
uselessness
by
that
process
which
is
the
salvation
of
many
a
corrupt
manipulator
the
process
of
amendment
predatory
corporations
predatory
business
associations
of
different
sorts
and
predatory
individuals
have
their
representatives
on
the
field
at
washington
to
ward
off
attack
by
any
means
that
brains
can
devise
or
money
procure
and
to
obtain
desired
favors
at
a
cost
that
will
leave
a
profitable
balance
for
the
purchaser
when
commercial
tricksters
believing
in
the
lobbyists
favorite
maxim
the
people
forget
feel
that
they
have
outlived
the
latest
reform
movement
and
see
the
good
old
days
returning
the
professional
politicians
introduce
a
few
reform
measures
themselves
most
stringent
measures
they
push
these
measures
ahead
until
somebody
pays
up
then
the
bills
die
the
lobbyist
knows
all
about
these
strike
bills
but
does
not
frown
on
them
no
no
he
helped
draw
up
one
of
these
bills
so
that
with
the
aid
of
his
inside
knowledge
of
his
business
the
measure
is
made
to
give
a
greater
scare
than
might
otherwise
have
resulted
the
bigger
the
scare
the
bigger
the
fund
advanced
of
course
for
the
lobbyist
to
handle
all
this
also
helps
the
lobbyist
to
secure
and
retain
employment
not
all
the
washington
lobbyists
are
outside
of
congress
the
senator
or
congressman
has
unequaled
facilities
for
oiling
or
blocking
the
course
of
a
bill
sometimes
he
confines
himself
to
the
interests
of
his
own
clients
whoever
they
may
be
but
sometimes
he
notices
a
bill
that
promises
to
be
a
pretty
good
thing
for
the
client
of
some
other
member
if
it
passes
then
he
begins
to
fight
this
bill
so
actively
that
he
must
be
let
in
on
the
deal
himself
this
is
very
annoying
to
the
other
member
but
the
experience
is
worth
something
he
has
learned
the
value
of
observing
other
people
legislation
the
outsiders
members
of
the
third
house
and
the
insiders
have
a
bond
of
freemasonry
uniting
them
they
exchange
information
as
to
what
members
of
both
houses
can
be
reached
how
they
can
be
got
to
through
whom
and
how
much
they
want
this
information
is
carefully
tabulated
and
now
prices
for
passing
or
defeating
legislation
can
be
quoted
to
interested
parties
just
as
the
price
of
a
carload
of
pork
can
be
ascertained
at
a
given
time
and
place
perhaps
it
is
this
system
that
leads
grafting
members
of
short
experience
to
wonder
how
knowledge
of
their
taking
what
is
termed
the
sugar
got
out
and
became
known
to
their
associates
did
they
not
have
pledge
of
absolute
secrecy
yes
but
the
purchaser
never
intended
to
keep
the
information
from
those
of
his
kind
lobbyists
must
be
honest
with
each
other
not
all
lobbyists
are
men
the
woman
legislative
agent
has
been
known
to
occupy
an
important
position
in
washington
and
she
does
yet
she
is
hard
to
detect
and
frequently
more
unprincipled
than
the
men
similarly
engaged
if
that
is
possible
a
woman
with
a
measure
of
social
standing
would
naturally
prove
the
most
successful
as
a
lobbyist
in
washington
because
of
the
opportunities
her
position
would
afford
her
to
meet
people
of
prominence
and
just
such
a
one
was
cora
spangler
with
whom
the
langdons
had
been
thrown
in
contact
quite
intimately
since
their
arrival
at
the
capital
pretty
and
vivacious
spangler
bore
her
years
with
uncommon
ease
aided
possibly
by
the
makeup
box
and
the
modiste
her
dinners
and
receptions
were
attended
by
people
of
acknowledged
standing
always
a
lavish
spender
of
money
this
was
explained
as
possible
because
of
a
fortune
left
her
by
her
late
husband
congressman
spangler
of
pennsylvania
that
this
fortune
had
consisted
largely
of
stock
and
bonds
of
a
bankrupt
copper
smelting
plant
in
michigan
remained
unknown
except
to
her
husband
family
one
or
two
of
her
own
relatives
and
senator
peabody
who
coming
from
pennsylvania
had
known
her
husband
intimately
he
it
was
who
had
suggested
to
her
that
she
might
make
money
easily
by
cultivating
the
acquaintance
of
the
new
members
of
both
houses
and
their
families
exerting
her
influence
in
various
perfectly
legitimate
ways
he
argued
for
or
against
matters
pending
in
legislation
the
standard
steel
corporation
kept
spangler
well
supplied
with
funds
deposited
monthly
to
her
account
in
a
philadelphia
trust
company
she
avoided
suspicion
by
reason
of
her
sex
and
her
many
acquaintances
of
undisputed
rank
senator
peabody
was
never
invited
to
her
home
had
never
attended
a
single
dinner
reception
or
musicale
she
had
given
all
of
which
was
a
part
of
the
policy
they
had
mutually
agreed
on
to
deaden
any
suspicion
that
might
some
time
arise
as
to
her
relation
to
the
standard
steel
company
it
was
well
known
that
peabody
had
been
put
into
the
senate
by
standard
steel
to
look
after
its
interests
he
had
found
spangler
chiefly
valuable
thus
far
as
a
source
of
information
regarding
the
members
of
congress
which
she
obtained
largely
from
their
families
he
was
thus
able
to
gain
an
idea
of
their
associations
their
particular
interests
and
their
aspirations
in
coming
to
congress
which
proved
of
much
use
to
him
in
forming
and
promoting
acquaintances
all
for
the
glory
of
standard
steel
senator
holcomb
of
missouri
told
spangler
at
an
afternoon
tea
confidentially
that
he
was
going
to
vote
against
the
ship
subsidy
bill
senator
peabody
was
informed
of
this
two
hours
later
by
a
note
written
in
cipher
when
the
vote
was
called
two
days
later
senator
holcomb
voted
for
the
bill
standard
steel
supplies
steel
for
ocean
liners
and
their
building
must
be
encouraged
windsor
wife
of
congressman
windsor
of
indiana
remarked
to
spangler
at
a
reception
that
she
was
so
glad
jimmie
is
going
to
do
something
for
us
women
at
last
he
says
we
ought
to
get
silk
gowns
ever
so
much
cheaper
next
year
jimmie
windsor
was
a
member
of
the
house
committee
on
ways
and
means
and
was
busily
engaged
in
the
matter
of
tariff
revision
when
president
anders
of
the
federal
silk
company
heard
from
senator
peabody
that
windsor
favored
lowering
the
tariff
on
silk
a
way
was
found
to
convince
the
congressman
that
the
american
silk
industry
was
a
weakling
and
many
investors
would
suffer
if
the
foreign
goods
should
be
admitted
any
cheaper
than
at
present
president
anders
would
be
willing
to
do
senator
peabody
a
favor
some
day
sometimes
cora
spangler
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
what
would
become
of
her
if
she
should
make
some
slip
some
fatal
error
and
be
discovered
to
her
friends
as
a
betrayer
of
confidences
for
money
a
secret
agent
of
standard
steel
what
a
newspaper
story
she
would
make
society
favorite
a
paid
spy
woman
lobbyist
flees
capital
the
sensational
headlines
flitted
through
her
mind
then
she
would
grit
her
teeth
and
dig
her
finger
nails
into
her
palms
she
had
to
have
money
to
carry
on
the
life
she
loved
so
well
she
must
continue
as
she
had
begun
after
all
she
reasoned
nothing
definite
could
ever
be
proved
regarding
the
past
let
the
future
care
for
itself
she
might
marry
again
and
free
herself
from
this
mode
of
life
who
knows
so
reasoned
cora
spangler
for
the
hundredth
time
during
the
last
two
years
as
she
sat
in
her
boudoir
at
her
home
she
had
spent
part
of
the
day
with
carolina
and
hope
langdon
and
in
the
evening
had
attended
the
musicale
at
their
house
but
she
had
been
forced
to
leave
early
owing
to
a
severe
headache
now
after
an
hour
or
two
of
rest
she
felt
better
and
was
about
to
retire
suddenly
the
telephone
bell
rang
at
a
near
a
window
she
had
two
telephones
one
in
the
lower
hall
and
one
in
her
boudoir
to
save
walking
downstairs
unnecessarily
she
explained
to
her
woman
friends
but
the
number
of
this
upstairs
telephone
was
not
in
the
public
book
it
had
a
private
number
known
to
but
two
people
except
herself
taking
down
the
receiver
she
asked
in
low
voice
hello
who
is
it
mr
wall
it
was
the
name
senator
peabody
used
in
telephone
conversation
with
her
yes
congressman
she
responded
she
always
said
yes
congressman
in
replying
to
wall
a
prearranged
manner
of
indicating
that
he
was
talking
to
the
desired
person
i
will
need
your
services
senator
peabody
said
on
a
very
important
matter
i
am
afraid
decline
any
engagements
and
hold
yourself
in
readiness
yes
i
may
send
my
friend
to
explain
things
at
in
the
morning
if
he
does
not
arrive
at
that
time
telephone
me
at
sharp
you
know
where
understand
i
have
put
off
going
to
philadelphia
yes
that
is
all
something
very
important
she
murmured
nervously
as
she
turned
from
the
desk
i
do
like
his
tone
of
voice
sounds
strained
and
worried
something
unusual
for
the
cold
flinty
gentleman
from
pennsylvania
and
his
of
course
means
stevens
great
heavens
then
stevens
must
now
have
knowledge
of
my
my
business
she
calmed
herself
and
straightened
a
dainty
slender
finger
against
her
cheek
it
must
be
something
about
that
naval
base
bill
i
sure
been
worrying
peabody
all
session
she
mused
as
she
pressed
a
button
to
summon
her
maid
chapter
xxiii
the
boss
of
the
senate
gains
a
new
ally
spangler
would
have
flattered
herself
on
guessing
correctly
as
to
senator
peabody
uneasiness
had
she
heard
and
seen
all
that
had
taken
place
in
his
apartment
at
the
louis
napoleon
hotel
where
he
had
hurriedly
taken
senator
stevens
on
leaving
the
langdon
house
not
only
would
the
two
senators
lose
their
immense
profits
on
the
altacoola
transaction
if
langdon
persisted
in
his
opposition
but
they
would
lose
as
well
the
thousands
of
dollars
spent
by
their
agents
in
purchasing
options
on
hundreds
of
acres
and
where
they
could
not
get
options
the
land
itself
this
land
would
be
on
their
hands
unsalable
if
the
base
went
somewhere
else
moreover
they
feared
that
langdon
revolt
would
bring
unpleasant
newspaper
publicity
to
their
operations
there
only
one
course
to
pursue
stevens
snapped
peabody
as
they
took
off
their
overcoats
that
is
to
be
prepared
as
best
we
can
for
the
very
worst
and
meet
it
in
some
way
yet
to
be
determined
but
first
we
must
try
to
figure
out
what
langdon
is
going
to
do
what
it
can
be
that
he
says
he
will
tell
us
at
if
we
appear
he
must
have
something
very
startling
up
his
sleeve
if
he
makes
good
his
assertions
i
ca
see
how
nor
i
frowned
stevens
and
my
political
eyesight
is
far
better
than
that
fool
langdon
under
ordinary
circumstances
we
could
let
him
go
ahead
with
his
minority
report
for
gulf
city
but
as
things
stand
he
have
every
newspaper
reporter
in
washington
buzzing
around
and
asking
impertinent
questions
yes
and
you
and
i
would
have
to
go
to
paris
to
live
with
our
life
insurance
friends
from
new
york
would
we
laughed
peabody
sarcastically
i
going
to
send
for
jake
steinert
he
added
steinert
stevens
ejaculated
what
oh
that
all
right
maybe
he
can
suggest
something
said
peabody
going
to
the
telephone
we
too
much
at
stake
to
make
a
mistake
and
jake
may
see
a
point
that
we
overlooked
luckily
i
saw
him
downstairs
in
the
as
we
came
through
to
the
elevator
steinert
is
all
right
himself
continued
stevens
but
his
methods
ca
be
too
particular
now
about
his
methods
or
ours
stevens
when
a
bull
like
langdon
breaks
loose
in
the
political
china
shop
fortune
and
reputation
are
both
fragile
a
ring
of
a
bell
announced
the
arrival
of
jake
steinert
whose
reputation
as
a
lobbyist
of
advanced
ability
had
spread
wide
in
the
twenty
years
he
had
spent
in
washington
of
medium
height
sallow
complexion
dark
hair
and
dark
eyes
his
broad
shoulders
filled
the
doorway
as
he
entered
an
illy
kept
mustache
almost
hid
a
forceful
mouth
almost
as
forceful
as
some
of
the
language
he
used
his
eyes
darted
first
to
peabody
and
then
to
stevens
waiting
for
either
of
them
to
open
the
conversation
the
highest
class
lobbyists
those
who
swing
the
biggest
deals
concern
themselves
only
with
men
who
can
handle
or
who
control
lawmakers
they
get
regular
reports
and
outline
the
campaign
like
crafty
spiders
they
hide
in
the
center
of
a
great
web
a
web
of
bribery
threat
cajolery
and
intrigue
intent
on
every
victim
that
is
lured
into
the
glistening
meshes
only
the
small
fry
mingle
freely
with
the
legislators
in
the
open
in
the
hotels
and
cafés
and
in
the
capitol
corridors
jake
steinert
did
not
belong
in
either
of
these
classes
he
ranked
somewhere
between
the
biggest
and
the
smallest
he
coupled
colossal
boldness
with
the
most
expert
knowledge
of
all
the
intricate
workings
of
the
congressional
mechanism
given
money
to
spend
among
members
to
secure
the
defeat
of
a
bill
he
would
frequently
put
most
of
the
money
in
his
own
pocket
and
for
a
comparatively
small
sum
defeat
it
by
influencing
the
employees
through
whose
hands
it
must
pass
sit
down
jake
something
to
drink
asked
peabody
reaching
for
a
decanter
no
grunted
the
lobbyist
do
drink
durin
business
hours
only
durin
the
day
well
jake
said
the
pennsylvanian
you
probably
know
something
of
what
going
on
in
the
naval
affairs
committee
you
mean
the
biggest
job
of
the
session
yes
sure
thing
senator
it
the
work
of
an
artist
the
boss
of
the
senate
smiled
grimly
now
suppose
a
committeeman
named
langdon
absolutely
refused
to
be
taken
care
of
and
insisted
on
handing
in
a
minority
report
with
a
speech
that
read
like
the
declaration
of
independence
steinert
jerked
his
head
forward
quickly
you
mean
what
would
i
do
if
i
was
er
if
i
was
runnin
the
job
yes
steinert
leaned
toward
peabody
where
do
i
come
in
on
this
he
asked
suspiciously
come
come
man
was
the
irritable
retort
i
never
let
a
few
dollars
stand
between
myself
and
my
friends
all
right
senator
the
lobbyist
thrust
himself
down
in
his
chair
puffed
slowly
at
a
cigar
and
gazed
thoughtfully
at
the
ceiling
few
years
ago
he
began
after
a
minute
or
two
there
was
a
feller
who
was
goin
to
squeal
about
a
bond
issue
he
had
his
speech
all
really
to
warn
the
country
that
he
thought
a
crowd
of
the
plutocracy
was
goin
to
get
the
bonds
to
resell
to
the
public
at
advanced
rates
well
sir
i
arranged
to
have
a
carriage
a
closed
carriage
call
that
night
to
take
him
to
see
the
president
for
he
was
told
the
president
sent
the
carriage
for
him
when
he
got
out
he
was
at
the
insane
asylum
an
i
can
tell
you
he
was
bundled
into
a
padded
cell
in
jig
time
where
he
stayed
for
three
days
thinks
he
a
member
of
congress
i
told
the
two
huskies
that
handled
him
an
gave
each
a
note
the
doctor
that
signed
the
necessary
papers
got
considerable
more
stevens
gasp
of
amazement
caused
the
narrator
genuine
enjoyment
i
know
of
a
certain
senator
who
was
drunk
an
laid
away
in
a
turkish
bath
when
the
roll
was
called
on
a
certain
bill
he
was
a
friend
of
peabody
laughed
the
lobbyist
to
the
mississippian
but
in
this
case
said
stevens
we
must
be
very
careful
possibly
some
of
your
methods
in
handling
the
men
you
go
after
say
interposed
steinert
you
know
i
do
do
all
pursuin
all
the
goin
after
any
more
than
others
in
my
business
why
senator
some
of
these
congressmen
worry
the
life
out
of
us
folks
that
sprinkle
the
sugar
they
accuse
us
of
not
lettin
in
on
things
when
they
have
been
fed
in
some
time
they
come
down
the
trail
like
greyhounds
coursin
a
coyote
the
speaker
paused
and
glanced
across
at
peabody
who
however
was
too
busily
engaged
in
writing
in
a
memorandum
book
to
notice
him
why
senator
stevens
went
on
the
lobbyist
only
a
down
east
member
held
me
up
to
tell
me
that
he
was
strong
for
that
proposition
to
give
the
and
railroad
grants
of
government
timber
land
in
oregon
he
says
to
me
he
says
h
l
do
my
constituents
in
new
england
care
about
things
out
on
the
pacific
coast
i
give
yellowstone
national
park
for
a
freight
sidin
if
was
any
use
to
he
says
so
you
see
i
must
go
broke
in
stevens
rising
and
glancing
at
his
watch
it
will
soon
be
daylight
if
you
must
have
sleep
go
but
you
must
be
here
at
sharp
in
the
morning
said
peabody
steinert
will
sleep
here
with
me
we
all
have
breakfast
together
here
in
my
rooms
and
a
final
consultation
you
wo
plan
anything
really
desperate
peabody
will
you
i
think
i
rather
nonsense
stevens
of
course
not
our
game
will
be
to
try
to
weaken
langdon
to
prove
to
him
in
the
morning
that
he
alone
will
suffer
because
our
names
do
not
appear
in
the
land
deals
the
options
were
signed
and
the
deeds
signed
by
our
agents
do
you
see
whereas
his
daughter
and
son
and
future
actually
took
land
in
their
own
names
how
clumsy
yes
such
amateurism
lowers
the
dignity
of
the
united
states
senate
peabody
answered
dryly
but
suppose
langdon
does
not
weaken
asked
stevens
anxiously
as
he
picked
up
his
hat
and
coat
then
we
will
go
into
action
with
our
guns
loaded
was
the
reply
chapter
xxiv
the
honeybird
in
the
african
jungle
dwells
a
pretty
little
bird
that
lives
on
honey
the
saccharine
dainty
is
there
found
in
the
hollows
of
trees
and
under
the
bark
where
what
is
known
as
the
carpenter
bee
bores
and
deposits
his
extract
from
the
buds
and
blossoms
of
the
tropical
forest
the
bird
is
called
the
honeybird
because
it
is
a
sure
guide
to
the
deposits
of
the
delicacy
the
bird
dislikes
the
laborious
task
of
pecking
its
way
through
the
bark
to
reach
the
honey
and
so
wise
in
the
ways
of
men
it
procures
help
it
locates
a
nest
of
honey
then
flies
about
until
it
sees
some
natives
or
hunters
to
whom
it
shows
itself
they
know
the
honeybird
and
know
that
it
will
lead
them
to
the
treasure
store
following
the
bird
which
flits
just
in
advance
they
reach
the
cache
of
dripping
sweetness
and
readily
lay
it
open
with
hatchets
or
knives
taking
what
they
want
there
is
always
enough
left
clinging
to
the
tree
and
easily
accessible
to
satisfy
the
appetite
of
the
clever
little
bird
senator
stevens
of
mississippi
bears
a
marked
resemblance
to
the
honeybird
so
much
so
that
he
has
well
won
the
bird
appellation
for
himself
abnormally
keen
at
locating
possibilities
for
extracting
honey
from
the
governmental
affairs
in
washington
he
invariably
led
peabody
representing
the
hunter
with
the
ax
to
the
repository
he
would
then
rely
on
the
pennsylvanian
superior
force
to
break
down
the
barriers
stevens
would
flutter
about
and
gather
up
the
leavings
equally
as
mercenary
as
the
boss
of
the
senate
he
lacked
iron
nerve
determination
resourcefulness
and
daring
he
needed
many
hours
of
sleep
peabody
could
work
twenty
hours
at
a
stretch
he
had
to
have
his
meals
regularly
or
else
suffer
from
indigestion
peabody
sometimes
did
a
day
work
on
two
boiled
eggs
and
a
cup
of
coffee
the
senior
senator
from
mississippi
had
been
the
first
to
point
out
to
peabody
the
possibilities
for
profit
in
the
gulf
naval
base
project
but
the
morning
following
the
conference
with
steinert
when
he
rejoined
them
for
breakfast
at
the
louis
napoleon
he
was
far
from
comfortable
he
did
not
mind
fighting
brain
against
brain
even
though
unprincipled
methods
were
resorted
to
but
indications
were
that
more
violent
agencies
would
be
called
into
play
owing
to
the
complications
that
had
arisen
stevens
ate
heartily
to
strengthen
his
courage
steinert
ate
hugely
to
strengthen
his
body
peabody
ate
scarcely
anything
at
all
to
strengthen
his
brain
waving
away
the
hotel
waiter
who
had
brought
the
breakfast
to
his
apartment
senator
peabody
outlined
the
probable
campaign
of
the
day
if
our
best
efforts
to
weaken
and
scare
off
langdon
fail
he
said
it
will
naturally
develop
that
we
must
render
it
impossible
in
some
way
for
him
to
appear
in
the
senate
at
all
or
we
must
delay
his
arrival
until
after
the
report
of
the
committee
on
naval
affairs
has
been
made
in
either
event
he
would
not
have
another
opportunity
to
speak
on
that
subject
of
course
later
at
we
will
know
his
plan
of
action
then
we
can
act
to
the
very
point
but
we
must
be
prepared
for
any
situation
that
can
arise
can
not
the
president
of
the
senate
be
persuaded
not
to
recognize
langdon
on
the
floor
then
we
could
adjourn
and
shut
him
off
asked
stevens
no
responded
peabody
he
has
already
promised
langdon
to
recognize
him
and
the
president
of
the
senate
can
not
be
persuaded
to
break
his
word
i
am
painfully
aware
of
this
fact
but
stevens
was
not
yet
dissuaded
from
the
hope
of
defeating
the
junior
senator
from
mississippi
by
wit
alone
can
we
not
have
a
speaker
get
the
floor
before
langdon
and
have
him
talk
for
hours
tire
out
the
old
kicker
and
await
a
time
when
he
leaves
the
senate
chamber
to
eat
or
talk
to
some
visitor
we
could
have
call
on
him
then
shove
the
bill
through
summarily
he
suggested
i
gone
over
all
that
answered
peabody
quickly
it
would
only
be
delaying
the
evil
hour
you
would
be
able
to
move
that
old
codger
away
from
the
senate
chamber
with
a
team
of
oxen
once
he
gets
to
his
seat
his
secretary
haines
another
oversight
of
yours
stevens
the
latter
winced
will
warn
him
langdon
would
stick
pins
through
his
eyelids
to
keep
from
falling
asleep
i
been
thinkin
put
in
steinert
slowly
that
a
little
like
this
might
keep
him
away
when
langdon
in
his
committee
room
before
goin
to
the
senate
send
him
a
telegram
signed
by
one
of
his
frien
name
that
one
of
his
daughters
is
dyin
from
injuries
in
a
automobile
collision
a
few
miles
out
o
town
that
ridiculous
snorted
peabody
he
know
where
they
were
always
huh
then
put
in
more
how
what
hev
some
take
out
no
no
man

peabody
they
stick
in
town
to
hear
their
father

speech

on
the

i
hev
watched
by
a
careful
picked
man
a
nigger
that
wo

with
the
colonel
on

but
the
negro
how
could

get
a
man
to
undergo
arrest
on
such
a
serious
charge

exclaimed
stevens
there
there
said
steinert
patronizingly
coons
has
more
genteel
home
life
in
jail
than
they
does
out
an
do
forget
the
district
of
columbia
is
governed
by
folks
that
ai
residents
of
it
only
the
session
th
politicians
do
leave
their
frien
in
the
cooler
very
long
say
senator
stevens
are
you
kiddin
me
is
it
any
different
down
in
your
the
mississippian
choked
and
spluttered
over
a
gulp
of
unusually
hot
coffee
and
peabody
again
decided
steinert
to
be
on
the
wrong
tack
that
proceeding
would
attract
too
much
attention
from
the
newspapers
he
added
well
i
thought
you
wanted
to
win
grunted
steinert
i
been
offerin
you
good
stuff
too
new
stuff
none
of
yer
druggin
with
chloroform
or
ticklin
with
blackjacks
why
i
gone
from
to
common
sense
but
come
to
think
of
it
how
about
some
woman
i
get
one
to
introduce
to
this
is
the
wrong
kind
of
a
man
interrupted
peabody
unless
you
got
the
right
kind
of
a
woman
went
on
steinert
senator
stevens
choked
some
more
the
boss
of
the
senate
sank
down
in
his
chair
crossed
one
knee
over
the
other
and
drummed
his
fingers
lightly
on
the
table
he
gazed
thoughtfully
at
stevens
yes
he
observed
slowly
unless
you
got
the
right
sort
of
a
woman
rising
he
led
the
mississippian
to
one
side
the
lobbyist
heard
the
southerner
give
a
short
exclamation
of
astonishment
as
peabody
whispered
to
him
it
all
right
it
all
right
he
then
heard
the
pennsylvanian
say
irritably
she
understand
she
can
be
trusted
expects
stevens
gave
a
violent
start
at
the
last
assurance
but
his
colleague
hurriedly
helped
him
into
his
coat
go
in
a
closed
carriage
was
peabody
final
warning
be
sure
to
tell
her
to
get
hold
of
his
two
daughters
on
some
pretext
at
once
she
knows
them
well
maybe
we
can
influence
the
old
man
through
his
girls
do
you
see
and
while
senator
peabody
and
jake
steinert
recurred
to
a
previous
discussion
concerning
one
telfer
mayor
of
gulf
city
senator
stevens
started
on
the
most
memorable
drive
of
his
career
on
this
bright
winter
morning
to
the
house
of
the
fascinating
spangler
who
for
the
past
week
had
been
considering
his
proposal
of
marriage
chapter
xxv
carolina
langdon
renunciation
senator
langdon
committee
room
at
the
capitol
presented
a
busy
scene
at
an
unusually
early
hour
the
morning
after
the
entertainment
at
his
home
bud
haines
reinstated
as
secretary
was
picking
up
the
thread
of
routine
where
he
had
dropped
it
the
day
before
though
his
frequent
thought
of
hope
and
the
words
that
had
thrilled
him
i
love
you
i
love
you
fondly
made
this
task
unusually
difficult
he
impatiently
wished
the
afternoon
to
hasten
along
as
he
knew
he
would
then
see
her
in
the
senate
gallery
where
she
would
go
to
hear
her
father
speech
this
speech
had
to
be
revised
in
some
particulars
by
bud
and
the
work
he
knew
would
take
up
much
of
the
morning
the
senator
speech
was
the
south
of
the
future
which
he
would
deliver
when
recognized
by
the
president
of
the
senate
in
connection
with
the
naval
base
bill
that
officer
having
agreed
to
recognize
langdon
at
at
which
time
the
report
of
the
naval
affairs
committee
would
be
received
just
how
langdon
would
turn
the
tables
on
peabody
and
stevens
and
yet
win
for
the
altacoola
site
not
even
the
man
experienced
in
politics
had
solved
clearly
the
senator
would
have
to
do
some
tall
thinking
during
the
morning
the
junior
senator
from
mississippi
burst
into
the
office
with
his
habitual
cheery
greeting
his
black
felt
hat
in
its
usual
position
on
the
back
of
his
head
like
a
symbol
of
undying
defiance
a
busy
day
for
us
eh
senator
queried
bud
now
look
here
my
boy
do
begin
to
remind
me
of
work
right
off
he
said
with
a
humorous
gleam
in
his
eye
go
easy
on
me
forget
i
her
father
bud
laughed
through
the
flush
that
rose
in
his
cheeks
no
i
wo
forget
that
but
have
you
decided
what
to
tell
peabody
and
stevens
as
your
plan
of
action
if
they
come
in
here
at
if
they
come
exclaimed
langdon
they
come
watch
then
he
hesitated
worriedly
i
have
to
incubate
an
idea
between
now
and
noon
somehow
but
do
forget
this
bud
we
worried
about
them
true
enough
but
they
worried
a
heap
more
about
us
senator
langdon
stepped
into
an
adjoining
room
where
he
could
be
alone
to
incubate
as
haines
resumed
his
work
carolina
langdon
entered
avoiding
the
secretary
direct
gaze
she
asked
for
her
father
he
ought
to
be
back
shortly
miss
langdon
responded
haines
you
can
wait
here
i
must
ask
pardon
for
leaving
as
i
must
run
over
to
the
library
as
the
secretary
bowed
himself
out
of
the
door
he
almost
collided
with
congressman
norton
both
glared
at
each
other
and
remained
silent
carolina
spoke
norton
as
he
entered
i
hope
i
know
you
allow
your
father
to
influence
you
against
me
because
of
last
night
i
carolina
would
rather
not
have
met
charles
norton
on
this
morning
she
had
hardly
slept
for
the
night
she
had
fought
a
battle
with
herself
her
father
had
shown
her
plainly
the
mistake
she
had
made
she
saw
that
her
influence
had
not
been
without
effect
on
randolph
probably
for
the
first
time
she
realized
that
there
are
glory
and
luxury
pleasure
and
prestige
for
which
too
big
a
price
can
be
paid
the
senator
daughter
turned
slowly
and
faced
the
man
she
had
promised
to
marry
charlie
i
have
come
to
a
decision
i
came
here
to
talk
with
father
about
it
norton
started
toward
carolina
a
look
of
apprehension
on
his
face
he
gathered
from
the
trend
of
her
words
and
her
demeanor
that
she
had
turned
against
him
you
could
be
so
cruel
carolina
he
protested
charlie
she
went
on
determinedly
i
will
always
cherish
our
friendship
our
happy
younger
days
down
in
mississippi
but
i
must
give
up
thinking
of
you
as
my
future
husband
we
both
made
a
mistake
mine
probably
greater
than
yours
but
i
now
am
convinced
that
i
should
not
marry
you
your
way
of
thinking
about
life
is
all
wrong
and
you
are
too
deeply
entangled
with
the
dishonest
men
in
washington
to
draw
back
i
can
not
love
you
but
i
am
doing
it
all
for
your
sake
carolina
do
let
an
father
come
between
a
man
and
a
woman
and
their
love
he
cried
charlie
i
must
give
you
up
the
girl
turned
to
one
side
as
though
to
give
norton
a
chance
to
leave
he
looked
at
her
in
silence
for
a
moment
or
two
then
a
change
came
into
his
bearing
wrinkling
his
face
into
a
sneer
he
stepped
before
the
girl
you
been
converted
mighty
sudden
i
reckon
from
land
speculating
to
preaching
and
preaching
too
against
folks
who
tried
to
make
a
fortune
for
you
norton
stopped
expecting
a
reply
but
the
girl
remained
silent
you
think
i
done
for
that
i
lost
my
money
that
why
you
turned
from
me
so
quickly
he
laughed
scornfully
but
i
show
you
you
and
your
blundering
old
father
i
win
you
yet
and
ruin
your
father
political
reputation
i
are
you
quite
sure
about
that
spoke
a
voice
sharply
behind
the
congressman
he
swung
around
vigorously
bud
haines
had
returned
in
time
to
hear
norton
threat
yes
and
while
i
doing
that
i
take
time
to
show
you
up
too
somehow
i
guess
a
congressman
word
will
count
against
that
of
a
cheap
secretary
that
what
miss
langdon
said
you
were
carolina
looked
appealingly
to
haines
to
rid
her
of
the
presence
of
this
man
whose
last
words
she
knew
haines
would
not
believe
but
norton
had
had
his
say
he
retreated
to
the
door
miss
langdon
he
cried
as
he
backed
out
and
away
you
have
an
idea
that
i
am
dishonest
but
kindly
remember
that
whatever
you
think
i
am
i
never
was
a
hypocrite
haines
advanced
and
procured
a
chair
for
miss
langdon
i
very
sorry
to
have
come
back
at
such
a
time
he
began
the
girl
cut
him
short
with
a
gesture
i
want
to
say
to
you
she
said
then
halted
that
i
want
to
be
friends
with
you
i
want
you
to
forget
the
happenings
of
yesterday
last
evening
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
in
them
i
want
to
work
together
with
you
and
father
and
so
does
randolph
father
and
you
are
standing
together
to
uphold
the
honor
of
the
langdons
of
mississippi
and
randolph
and
i
no
matter
the
cost
of
our
former
folly
want
to
share
in
that
work
before
haines
could
reply
senator
langdon
burst
into
the
room
bud
bud
he
cried
i
got
it
i
got
it
you
got
what
senator
exclaimed
the
secretary
that
idea
my
boy
that
idea
it
incubated
all
right
and
peabody
and
stevens
can
come
just
as
soon
as
they
want
to
chapter
xxvi
the
battles
of
washington
at
twenty
minutes
after
senator
langdon
and
secretary
haines
were
still
undisturbed
by
any
move
on
the
part
of
peabody
and
stevens
who
maintained
a
silence
that
to
haines
was
distinctly
ominous
his
experience
at
the
capitol
had
taught
him
that
when
the
senate
machine
was
quiet
it
was
time
for
some
one
to
get
out
from
under
miss
williams
the
naval
committee
stenographer
entered
senator
langdon
she
said
senator
peabody
and
senator
stevens
are
in
committee
room
and
they
told
me
to
tell
you
that
they
be
i
ca
say
it
please
sir
i
d
d
interpolated
langdon
laughing
yes
sir
that
it
they
be
that
if
they
come
in
here
at
you
must
come
to
them
they
say
tell
the
gentlemen
i
sitting
here
with
my
hat
on
the
back
of
my
head
smoking
a
good
with
nails
driven
through
both
shoes
into
the
floor
and
looking
at
the
clock
at
senator
stevens
entered
i
came
to
warn
you
langdon
he
said
that
senator
patience
is
nearly
exhausted
you
must
come
to
see
him
at
once
if
you
expect
the
south
to
get
a
naval
base
at
altacoola
or
anywhere
else
if
you
do
not
agree
to
take
his
advice
this
naval
bill
and
any
other
that
you
are
interested
in
now
or
in
future
will
be
trampled
underfoot
in
the
senate
mississippi
will
have
no
use
for
a
senator
who
can
not
produce
results
in
washington
and
that
will
prove
the
bitterest
lesson
you
have
ever
learned
i
waiting
for
peabody
here
stevens
oh
ridiculous
of
course
he
not
coming
why
langdon
he
the
king
of
the
senate
he
has
the
biggest
men
of
the
country
at
his
call
he
he
got
one
minute
left
observed
langdon
looking
at
the
clock
but
he
come
i
trust
peabody
more
than
the
best
clock
made
at
a
time
like
this
when
the
figure
of
the
senior
senator
from
pennsylvania
appeared
in
the
doorway
senator
langdon
he
remarked
icily
same
to
you
have
a
senator
said
langdon
he
turned
and
winked
significantly
at
haines
the
three
senators
seated
themselves
i
suppose
you
would
consider
yourself
so
important
langdon
if
you
knew
that
we
now
find
we
can
get
another
member
of
the
naval
affairs
committee
over
to
our
side
for
altacoola
began
peabody
that
gives
us
a
majority
of
the
committee
without
your
vote
that
would
prevent
me
from
making
a
minority
report
for
gulf
city
and
explaining
why
i
made
that
report
would
it
the
mississippian
asked
blandly
peabody
and
stevens
both
knew
that
it
would
stevens
exchanged
glances
with
the
boss
of
the
senate
and
in
low
voice
began
making
to
langdon
a
proposition
to
which
peabody
assent
had
been
gained
langdon
we
would
like
to
be
alone
and
he
nodded
toward
haines
sorry
ca
oblige
senator
langdon
replied
bud
and
i
together
make
up
the
senator
from
mississippi
all
right
what
i
want
to
say
is
this
the
president
is
appointing
a
commission
to
investigate
the
condition
of
the
unemployed
the
members
are
to
go
to
europe
five
or
six
countries
and
look
into
conditions
there
leisurely
of
course
so
as
to
formulate
a
piece
of
legislation
that
will
solve
the
existing
problems
in
this
country
a
most
generous
expense
account
will
be
allowed
by
the
government
a
member
can
take
his
family
a
son
for
instance
could
act
as
financial
secretary
under
liberal
pay
i
heard
of
that
commission
said
langdon
well
senator
peabody
has
the
naming
of
two
senators
who
will
go
on
that
commission
and
i
suggested
that
your
character
and
ability
would
make
you
good
glory
exclaimed
langdon
you
mean
that
my
character
and
ability
would
make
me
something
or
other
if
i
kept
my
mouth
shut
in
the
senate
this
afternoon
stevens
i
been
surprised
so
many
times
since
i
came
to
the
capital
that
it
does
affect
me
any
more
just
amused
at
your
offer
or
senator
peabody
i
want
to
tell
you
two
senators
that
there
only
one
thing
that
i
want
in
washington
and
you
have
offered
it
to
me
yet
when
you
do
i
do
business
with
you
what
that
speak
out
man
said
peabody
quickly
a
square
deal
for
the
people
of
the
united
states
good
lord
exclaimed
the
boss
of
the
senate
is
this
washington
or
is
it
heaven
it
is
not
heaven
senator
put
in
haines
man
alive
cried
peabody
i
been
in
washington
so
long
that
so
long
that
you
forgotten
that
the
american
people
really
exist
retorted
langdon
and
there
are
more
like
you
in
the
senate
all
because
the
voters
have
no
chance
to
choose
their
own
senators
the
public
in
most
states
have
to
take
the
kind
of
a
senator
that
the
legislature
made
up
mostly
of
politicians
feels
like
making
them
take
you
peabody
would
be
in
the
senate
if
the
voters
had
anything
to
say
about
it
the
pennsylvanian
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
now
i
tell
you
honorable
senators
went
on
langdon
thoroughly
aroused
something
to
surprise
you
i
have
discovered
that
you
were
not
working
for
yourselves
alone
in
the
altacoola
deal
but
that
you
intend
to
turn
your
land
over
to
the
standard
steel
company
at
a
big
profit
as
soon
as
this
naval
base
bill
is
passed
then
that
company
will
squeeze
the
government
for
the
best
part
of
the
hundred
millions
that
are
to
be
spent
the
senator
sank
back
in
his
chair
and
gazed
at
his
two
opponents
those
two
statesmen
jumped
to
their
feet
come
stevens
let
him
do
what
he
will
we
can
not
stay
here
to
be
insulted
by
the
ravings
of
a
madman
cried
the
pennsylvanian
but
he
brought
his
associate
to
a
standstill
midway
to
the
door
by
the
way
langdon
what
is
it
you
are
going
to
do
in
the
senate
this
afternoon
he
asked
you
said
you
were
going
to
make
us
honest
against
our
will
you
know
you
ca
do
anything
bud
haines
turned
his
face
toward
the
speaker
and
grinned
broadly
to
the
senator
intense
discomfort
i
do
more
than
that
announced
langdon
rising
and
pounding
a
fist
into
his
open
hand
i
make
you
and
stevens
more
popular
than
you
ever
were
in
your
lives
before
bah
shouted
peabody
i
do
even
more
yet
i
going
to
make
you
generous
patriots
and
i
regret
to
say
i
give
you
the
chance
to
make
the
hits
of
your
careers
the
polished
hypocrites
looked
at
him
too
astonished
to
move
how
what
they
gasped
swept
on
by
his
own
enthusiasm
and
the
force
of
his
own
courageous
honesty
the
voice
of
the
southerner
rose
to
oratorical
height
this
afternoon
he
exclaimed
when
the
naval
base
committee
makes
its
report
i
will
rise
in
my
place
and
declare
that
for
once
in
the
history
of
the
senate
men
have
been
found
who
place
the
interests
of
the
government
they
serve
above
any
chance
of
pecuniary
reward
these
men
are
the
members
of
the
naval
base
committee
with
this
idea
in
view
realizing
that
dishonest
men
would
try
to
make
money
out
of
the
government
these
members
of
the
naval
base
committee
after
they
settled
on
altacoola
went
out
quietly
and
secured
control
of
all
the
land
that
will
be
needed
for
the
naval
base
and
these
men
secured
this
at
a
very
nominal
figure
now
they
are
ready
to
turn
over
their
land
to
the
government
at
exactly
what
they
paid
for
it
without
a
cent
of
profit
then
they
going
to
sit
up
over
there
in
that
senate
they
going
to
realize
that
a
new
kind
of
politics
has
arrived
in
washington
the
kind
that
i
and
lots
of
others
always
thought
there
was
here
and
gentlemen
he
advanced
on
his
colleagues
triumphantly
when
i
senator
langdon
of
mississippi
your
creation
in
politics
have
finished
that
speech
i
dare
one
of
you
to
get
up
and
deny
a
word
the
boss
of
the
senate
and
his
satellite
were
dumfounded
firmly
believing
that
langdon
could
find
no
way
to
pass
the
bill
for
altacoola
and
yet
spoil
their
crooked
scheme
they
were
totally
unprepared
for
any
such
dénoûement
to
think
that
a
simple
planter
from
the
cotton
fields
of
mississippi
could
originate
such
a
plan
to
outwit
the
two
ablest
political
tricksters
in
the
senate
langdon
eyed
his
colleagues
triumphantly
peabody
however
was
thinking
quickly
he
was
never
beaten
until
the
last
vote
was
counted
on
a
roll
call
he
knew
that
no
matter
how
apparently
insurmountable
an
opposition
was
a
way
to
overcome
it
might
often
be
found
by
the
man
who
exercises
strong
and
a
trained
brain
this
corrupt
victor
in
scores
of
bitter
political
engagements
on
the
battlefield
of
washington
was
now
in
his
most
dangerous
mood
he
would
marshal
all
his
forces
the
man
to
defeat
him
now
must
defeat
the
entire
senate
machine
and
the
allies
it
could
gain
in
an
emergency
he
must
overcome
the
power
of
standard
steel
he
must
fight
the
resourceful
brain
of
the
masterful
peabody
himself
peabody
whispered
to
stevens
we
must
pretend
to
be
beaten
illustration
after
i
have
finished
i
dare
one
of
you
to
deny
a
word
then
the
pennsylvanian
advanced
smiling
to
langdon
and
held
out
his
hand
senator
langdon
he
said
i
beaten
you
beaten
the
leader
of
the
senate
something
difficult
to
believe
what
more
you
given
me
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
to
become
known
as
a
public
benefactor
as
soon
as
you
finished
your
speech
in
the
senate
i
will
get
up
and
make
another
one
to
second
yours
here
my
hand
anything
you
may
ever
want
out
of
peabody
in
the
future
shall
be
yours
for
the
asking
langdon
refused
to
grasp
the
proffered
hand
senator
stevens
made
a
show
of
protesting
against
his
seeming
surrender
but
he
objected
look
here
peabody
turned
upon
him
instantly
oh
shut
up
stevens
do
be
a
fool
come
on
in
the
water
fine
the
pair
of
schemers
with
norton
at
their
heels
turned
away
the
pennsylvanian
drew
stevens
into
committee
room
and
ordering
the
stenographer
to
leave
drew
up
chairs
where
both
could
sit
facing
the
door
we
thrown
dust
in
that
old
gander
eyes
whispered
peabody
it
now
ten
after
he
is
to
be
recognized
to
make
his
speech
at
that
gives
us
two
hours
and
twenty
minutes
yes
but
for
what
asked
stevens
excitedly
i
been
trying
myself
to
think
of
something
what
will
you
do
what
you
do
the
boss
of
the
senate
smiled
patronizingly
on
the
senior
senator
from
mississippi
as
though
amused
and
scornful
of
his
limitations
as
a
strategist
as
a
tenacious
fighter
then
his
jaw
set
hard
and
his
brows
contracted
i
will
not
do
anything
i
can
not
do
anything
he
hesitated
a
full
ten
seconds
but
jake
steinert
can
stevens
hands
twitched
nervously
and
continued
peabody
i
expecting
a
call
from
him
any
moment
i
told
him
this
morning
that
he
might
be
able
to
make
before
night
if
the
telephone
bell
at
the
desk
interrupted
him
peabody
leaned
over
and
eagerly
clutched
the
receiver
the
senior
senator
from
mississippi
jerked
himself
to
his
feet
he
stood
at
a
window
and
looked
out
over
the
roof
tops
of
the
city
chapter
xxvii
spangler
gives
a
luncheon
when
senators
peabody
and
stevens
had
gone
langdon
and
bud
went
over
the
situation
together
and
concluded
that
their
opponents
had
no
means
of
defeating
langdon
program
that
after
all
peabody
might
really
have
meant
his
words
of
surrender
but
they
might
try
foul
play
better
stay
right
here
in
the
capitol
the
rest
of
the
day
suggested
bud
langdon
scoffed
at
the
idea
haines
bustled
away
to
get
a
few
mouthfuls
of
lunch
to
fortify
himself
for
a
busy
afternoon
one
that
was
going
to
be
far
busier
than
he
imagined
the
telephone
bell
rang
at
the
senator
desk
it
was
voice
that
spoke
senator
langdon
she
said
carolina
and
hope
georgia

here
at
my
home
for
luncheon
and
we
all
want
you
to
join
us

the
mississippian
but

afternoon

i
are
coming

all
drive
over
to
the
capitol
in
my
carriage
the
planter
hesitated
then
replied
all
right
i
be
over
but
it
must
be
a
very
long
luncheon
gone
to
eat
back
by
he
scratched
quickly
on
a
pad
on
the
secretary
desk
and
departed
spangler
luncheons
were
equally
as
popular
in
washington
as
senator
langdon
dinners
the
mississippian
and
his
daughters
enjoyed
the
delicacies
spread
lavishly
before
them
time
passed
quickly
the
old
planter
enjoyed
seeing
his
daughters
have
so
happy
a
time
and
he
was
not
insensible
to
the
charm
of
his
hostess
conversation
for
spangler
had
studied
carefully
the
art
of
ingratiating
herself
with
her
guests
suddenly
realizing
that
he
had
probably
reached
the
limit
of
the
time
he
could
spare
the
senator
drew
out
his
watch
what
a
stunning
fob
you
wear
quickly
spoke
spangler
reaching
out
her
hand
and
taking
the
watch
from
her
guest
hands
as
the
case
snapped
open
oh
that
carolina
doings
laughed
langdon
she
said
the
old
gold
chain
that
my
grandfather
left
me
was
why
how
lovely
murmured
spangler
glancing
at
the
watch
we
have
plenty
of
time
yet
wo
have
to
hurry
your
time
is
the
same
as
mine
she
added
nodding
her
head
toward
a
french
renaissance
clock
on
the
black
marble
mantel
as
the
hostess
did
this
she
deftly
turned
back
the
hands
of
the
senator
watch
minutes
do
you
care
to
smoke
senator
spangler
asked
as
her
guests
concluded
their
repast
if
the
young
ladies
do
not
object
langdon
inclined
his
head
gratefully
and
laughed
they
would
be
southern
girls
i
reckon
if
they
did
want
to
see
a
man
have
everything
to
make
him
happy
er
i
beg
pardon
spangler
i
mean
comfortable
nobody
that
your
guest
could
be
unhappy
the
hostess
beamed
on
the
chivalrous
southerner
langdon
drew
forth
a
thick
black
perfecto
and
settled
back
luxuriously
in
his
chair
after
another
glance
at
spangler
clock
he
was
absorbed
in
a
mental
résumé
of
his
forthcoming
speech
and
did
not
hear
the
next
words
of
the
woman
addressed
pointedly
to
his
daughters
do
you
know
really
why
this
luncheon
was
given
she
queried
then
she
continued
before
carolina
and
hope
georgia
could
formulate
replies
because
your
father
and
i
wanted
to
take
this
opportunity
to
announce
to
you
our
engagement
the
speaker
smiled
her
sweetest
smile
the
two
girls
gazed
at
each
other
in
uncontrollable
amazement
then
at
spangler
then
at
their
father
who
had
turned
partly
away
from
the
table
and
was
gazing
abstractedly
at
the
ceiling
hope
georgia
was
the
first
to
regain
her
voice
oh
spangler
she
ejaculated
you
are
very
kind
to
marry
father
but
what
that
exclaimed
the
senator
roused
from
his
thoughts
by
his
youngest
daughter
words
and
thrusting
himself
forward
spangler
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
oh
senator
i
have
just
told
the
dear
girls
that
you
had
asked
me
to
marry
you
that
we
were
soon
to
be
married
she
said
archly
looking
him
straight
in
the
eye
she
clasped
her
hands
and
murmured
i
am
so
happy
the
hero
of
crawfordsville
tried
to
speak
but
he
could
not
he
stared
at
his
hostess
who
smiled
the
smile
of
the
budding
debutante
his
own
astonishment
was
reflected
in
the
faces
of
carolina
and
hope
georgia
as
they
observed
their
father
expression
he
forgot
he
was
in
washington
he
did
not
know
he
was
a
senator
the
fact
that
he
had
ever
even
thought
of
making
a
speech
was
furthest
from
his
mind
what
did
it
all
mean
had
spangler
gone
suddenly
insane
his
daughters
what
did
they
think
these
thoughts
surged
through
his
flustered
brain
then
it
flashed
over
him
she
was
joking
in
some
new
fashionable
way
he
turned
toward
the
fair
widow
to
laugh
but
her
face
was
losing
its
smile
a
pained
expression
a
suggestion
of
intense
suffering
appeared
in
her
face
why
do
you
so
hesitate
senator
langdon
she
finally
asked
in
low
voice
just
loud
enough
for
the
two
girls
to
overhear
the
junior
senator
from
mississippi
looked
at
his
hostess
she
had
entertained
him
and
had
done
much
for
his
daughters
in
washington
she
was
alone
in
the
world
a
widow
he
felt
that
he
could
not
shame
her
before
carolina
and
hope
georgia
his
southern
chivalry
would
not
permit
that
then
too
she
was
a
most
charming
person
and
the
thought
why
not
why
not
take
her
at
her
word
crept
into
his
mind
yes
father
why
do
you
hesitate
asked
carolina
senator
langdon
mustered
his
voice
into
service
at
last
i
been
thinking
he
said
slowly
that
that
your
daughters
did
not
know
interrupted
spangler
of
our
the
telephone
upstairs
is
ringing
madam
said
a
maid
who
had
entered
to
spangler
the
adventuress
could
not
leave
the
senator
and
his
daughters
alone
though
she
knew
it
must
be
peabody
calling
her
at
any
moment
he
might
remember
his
speech
and
leave
already
late
he
would
still
be
later
though
because
he
would
have
no
carriage
hers
would
purposely
be
delayed
tell
the
person
speaking
that
you
are
empowered
to
bring
me
any
message
that
i
can
not
leave
the
she
said
to
the
maid
to
gain
time
and
to
hold
the
senator
attention
spangler
asked
slowly
well
senator
what
was
it
that
you
were
going
to
say
when
i
interrupted
you
a
few
moments
ago
langdon
had
been
racking
his
brain
for
some
inspiration
that
would
enable
him
to
save
the
feelings
of
his
hostess
and
yet
indicate
his
position
clearly
he
would
not
commit
himself
in
any
way
he
would
jump
up
and
pronounce
her
an
impostor
first
after
a
moment
of
silence
his
clouded
face
cleared
spangler
he
began
your
announcement
i
have
considered
to
be
premature
she
suggested
the
maid
returned
wall
says
senator
langdon
is
wanted
at
once
at
the
capitol
great
heavens
exclaimed
langdon
springing
to
his
feet
and
glancing
at
the
clock
i
late
i
late
i
hope
to
god
i
not
too
late
wall
says
a
carriage
is
coming
for
senator
langdon
concluded
the
maid
we
must
talk
this
matter
over
some
other
time
spangler
the
mississippian
cried
as
he
sent
a
servant
for
his
hat
and
coat
i
hope
that
carriage
hurries
else
i
try
it
on
the
run
for
the
capitol
it
a
half
hour
away
on
foot
said
spangler
better
wait
you
save
time
but
to
herself
she
muttered
as
though
mystified
i
wonder
why
peabody
changed
his
mind
so
suddenly
why
should
he
now
want
the
old
fool
at
the
capitol
the
rumble
of
wheels
was
heard
outside
hurry
father
cried
hope
georgia
the
senator
hurried
down
the
stone
steps
of
spangler
residence
as
rapidly
as
his
weight
and
the
excitement
under
which
he
labored
would
permit
opening
the
coach
door
he
plunged
inside
to
come
face
to
face
with
bud
haines
who
had
huddled
down
in
a
corner
to
avoid
observance
from
the
spangler
windows
the
driver
started
his
horses
off
on
a
run
struggling
to
regain
his
breath
the
senator
cried
well
what
are
never
mind
now
but
first
gather
in
all
i
say
senator
as
no
time
to
lose
when
i
could
locate
you
and
i
saw
you
probably
would
be
at
the
senate
chamber
in
time
to
make
your
speech
on
the
naval
base
bill
i
persuaded
senator
milbank
of
arkansas
to
rise
and
make
a
speech
on
the
currency
question
which
subject
was
in
order
he
was
under
obligation
to
me
for
some
important
information
i
once
obtained
for
him
and
he
consented
to
keep
the
floor
until
you
arrived
though
he
knew
he
would
earn
the
vengeance
of
peabody
that
was
over
an
hour
and
a
half
ago
he
must
be
reading
quotations
from
progress
to
the
senate
by
now
to
keep
the
floor
bud
paused
to
look
at
his
watch
the
senator
stretched
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
cried
drive
faster
got
your
speech
all
right
called
bud
above
the
din
of
the
rattling
wheels
yes
here
was
the
response
the
senator
tapping
his
inner
breast
pocket
thought
maybe
she
cried
bud
jerking
his
head
back
in
the
direction
from
which
they
had
come
the
mississippian
shook
his
head
negatively
and
set
his
jaws
determinedly
the
coach
swung
up
to
the
capitol
entrance
tell
me
asked
langdon
as
both
jumped
out
how
did
you
find
out
that
i
the
house
gave
a
name
peabody
uses
great
heavens
but
how
did
you
know
where
to
they
were
at
the
door
of
the
senate
chamber
norton
gave
me
the
tip
for
your
sake
and
carolina
for
old
sake

chapter
xxviii
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
too
much
occupied
in
concentrating
his
thoughts
on
his
speech
langdon
failed
to
notice
the
consternation
on
the
faces
of
peabody
and
stevens
as
he
walked
to
his
seat
in
the
senate
they
had
failed
to
succeed
in
getting
milbank
to
conclude
and
consequently
could
not
push
the
naval
base
report
through
but
they
noted
the
passing
of
over
an
hour
after
their
opponent
appointed
time
and
had
felt
certain
that
he
would
not
appear
at
all
the
boss
of
the
senate
leaned
across
to
stevens
and
whispered
hurriedly
we
must
tear
him
to
pieces
now
discredit
him
publicly
it
his
own
fault
our
agents
can
sell
the
land
to
standard
steel
our
connection
with
the
scheme
will
be
impossible
to
discover
after
we
have
made
the
public
believe
langdon
is
a
crook
but
how
about
our
supposed
combination
to
protect
the
government
that
langdon
will
tell
about
asked
stevens
we
ca
deny
that
of
course
no
answered
peabody
we
ca
deny
it
but
we
will
not
affirm
it
we
will
tell
interviewers
that
we
prefer
not
to
talk
about
it
it
our
only
chance
replied
stevens
cautiously
yes
and
we
owe
it
all
to
jake
steinert
went
on
peabody
that
fellow
telfer
will
do
anything
to
please
jake
jake
has
convinced
telfer
that
langdon
was
responsible
for
the
defeat
of
gulf
city
and
the
mayor
is
wild
for
revenge
the
boss
of
the
senate
rose
and
walked
to
the
rear
of
the
senate
chamber
to
issue
orders
to
two
of
his
colleagues
report
of
the
committee
on
naval
affairs
droned
the
clerk
mechanically
house
bill
no
is
amended
to
read
as
follows
and
his
voice
sank
to
an
unintelligible
mumble
for
every
senator
present
he
well
knew
was
aware
that
the
amendment
named
altacoola
as
the
naval
base
site
senator
langdon
rose
in
his
seat
president
he
called
chair
recognizes
the
gentleman
from
mississippi
said
the
presiding
officer
as
he
leaned
back
to
speak
to
senator
winans
of
kansas
who
had
approached
to
the
side
of
the
rostrum
the
langdon
speech
on
the
new
south
and
the
south
of
the
future
proved
more
than
a
document
suited
only
to
a
reverent
burial
in
the
although
wearied
at
the
start
owing
to
the
exciting
happenings
of
the
day
the
mississippian
enthusiasm
for
his
cause
gave
him
strength
and
stimulation
as
he
progressed
his
voice
rose
majestically
as
he
came
to
the
particular
points
he
wished
to
accentuate
and
even
those
in
the
uppermost
rows
in
the
galleries
could
hear
every
word
at
the
close
of
his
formal
speech
he
began
on
his
statement
of
the
action
of
the
naval
affairs
committee
in
buying
control
of
the
altacoola
land
to
foil
attempts
to
rob
the
government
as
he
had
predicted
the
senate
did
sit
up
the
senate
did
agree
that
a
new
kind
of
politics
had
arrived
during
this
latter
part
of
the
speech
many
curious
glances
were
directed
at
peabody
and
stevens
who
sat
in
the
same
tier
of
seats
in
the
middle
of
the
chamber
only
an
aisle
separating
them
through
this
choice
of
seats
they
could
confer
without
leaving
their
places
various
senatorial
associates
of
these
two
men
in
other
deals
found
it
difficult
to
believe
their
ears
but
was
not
old
langdon
at
this
moment
narrating
the
amazing
transaction
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
would
the
statue
on
the
pedestal
step
down
would
the
sphinx
of
the
desert
speak
the
story
of
the
lost
centuries
would
honor
take
the
place
of
expediency
in
the
affairs
of
state
what
might
not
happen
thought
the
senate
machine
now
that
peabody
and
stevens
had
taken
to
their
bosoms
what
they
termed
the
purple
pup
of
political
purity
neither
did
the
full
portent
of
the
situation
escape
the
attention
of
the
reporters

dick
cullen
observed
to

of
the
virtue
getting
so
thick
around
here
it
a
menace
to

blocking
the
traffic
eh
queried
hansel
and
both
laughed
hello
what
this
exclaimed
cullen
a
few
minutes
later
horton
has
been
recognized
when
the
program
was
to
adjourn
when
the
naval
base
bill
was
over
with
langdon
speech
had
proved
the
hit
the
sensation
of
the
session
after
he
concluded
amid
resounding
applause
in
which
senators
joined
as
well
as
occupants
of
the
galleries
senator
horton
of
montana
rose
and
caught
the
presiding
officer
eye
i
ask
unanimous
consent
to
offer
a
resolution
hearing
no
objection
he
continued
in
a
manner
that
instantly
attracted
unusual
attention
it
is
my
unpleasant
duty
peabody
and
stevens
exchanged
glances
to
place
a
matter
before
this
body
that
to
me
as
a
member
of
this
honorable
body
is
not
only
distasteful
but
deeply
to
be
regretted
there
has
arisen
ground
to
suspect
a
member
of
this
body
with
having
endeavored
to
make
money
at
the
government
expense
out
of
land
which
he
is
alleged
to
have
desired
his
own
committee
to
choose
as
the
naval
base
i
therefore
offer
this
resolution
providing
for
the
appointment
of
an
investigating
committee
to
look
into
these
charges
langdon
was
intensely
excited
over
this
new
development
some
one
has
learned
something
about
peabody
or
stevens
he
muttered
he
feared
that
this
new
complication
might
in
some
way
affect
the
fate
of
the
naval
base
that
the
south
and
mississippi
might
lose
it
he
rose
slowly
in
his
seat
while
the
senate
hummed
with
the
murmur
of
suppressed
voices
i
ask
for
more
definite
information
he
began
when
recognized
and
after
the
president
of
the
senate
had
pounded
with
the
gavel
to
restore
quiet
so
that
this
house
can
consider
this
important
matter
more
intelligently
senator
horton
rose
he
said
i
will
take
the
liberty
of
adding
that
the
senator
accused
is
none
other
than
the
junior
senator
from
mississippi
langdon
eyes
blazed
he
strode
swiftly
into
the
aisle
president
he
cried
passionately
i
know
this
is
not
the
time
or
place
for
a
discussion
like
this
but
ask
that
senatorial
courtesy
permit
me
to
ask
then
he
concluded
strongly
before
he
could
be
stopped
what
is
the
evidence
in
support
of
this
preposterous
charge
this
is
all
out
of
order
said
the
presiding
officer
after
a
pause
but
in
view
of
the
circumstances
i
will
entertain
a
motion
to
suspend
the
rules
this
motion
passing
horton
replied
to
langdon
your
name
is
signed
to
a
contract
with
telfer
mayor
of
gulf
city
calling
for
shares
in
the
gulf
city
land
company
and
a
lie
a
lie
screamed
langdon
that
official
went
on
horton
coolly
is
now
in
washington
he
has
the
contract
and
will
swear
to
conversations
with
you
and
your
secretary
his
testimony
will
be
corroborated
by
no
less
a
personage
than
congressman
norton
of
your
own
district
who
says
you
asked
him
to
conduct
part
of
the
negotiations
and
i
might
add
cried
horton
that
it
is
known
to
more
than
one
member
of
this
honorable
body
that
you
had
drawn
up
a
minority
report
in
favor
of
gulf
city
because
of
your
anger
at
the
defeat
of
your
plan
to
lake
the
naval
base
away
from
altacoola
langdon
sank
into
his
chair
bewildered
even
stunned
there
was
a
conspiracy
against
him
but
how
could
he
prove
it
the
ground
seemed
crumbling
from
under
him
not
even
a
straw
to
grasp
then
the
old
fighting
blood
that
carried
him
along
in
beauregard
van
tugged
at
the
valves
of
his
heart
revived
his
spirit
ran
through
his
veins
he
leaped
to
his
feet
a
sound
as
of
a
scuffle
a
body
falling
heavily
drew
all
eyes
from
langdon
to
the
rear
of
the
main
aisle
an
assistant
was
lying
face
downward
on
the
carpet
another
was
vainly
trying
to
hold
bud
haines
who
tearing
himself
free
rushed
down
to
his
chief
waving
a
sheet
of
paper
in
the
senator
eyes
read
that
gasped
the
secretary
breathlessly
and
he
hurried
away
up
a
side
passageway
and
out
to
reach
the
stairs
leading
to
the
press
gallery
langdon
spread
the
paper
before
him
with
difficulty
with
his
trembling
hands
slowly
his
whirling
brain
gave
him
the
ability
to
read
slowly
what
appeared
to
him
as
a
jumbled
nothing
resolved
into
orderly
lines
and
words
he
read
and
again
stood
before
the
senate
which
had
regained
its
usual
composure
after
the
fallen
had
regained
his
feet
and
rubbed
his
bruises
i
do
not
think
there
will
be
any
investigation
he
said
with
decided
effort
struggling
to
down
the
emotion
that
choked
him
i
ask
this
house
to
listen
to
the
following
letter
dear
senator
langdon
when
you
receive
this
letter
i
shall
be
well
on
my
way
to
take
a
steamer
for
cuba
i
write
to
ask
you
not
to
think
too
harshly
of
me
for
i
will
always
cherish
thoughts
of
the
friendship
you
have
shown
me
peabody
and
stevens
have
finally
proved
too
much
for
me
when
they
got
old
telfer
to
swear
to
a
forged
contract
and
wanted
me
to
forge
your
name
in
the
land
records
at
gulf
city
i
threw
up
my
hands
their
game
will
always
go
on
i
suppose
but
you
gave
them
a
shock
when
you
broke
up
their
altacoola
graft
scheme
and
glad
you
did
they
cast
me
aside
probably
thinking
they
could
get
me
again
if
they
needed
me
i
am
going
on
the
sugar
plantation
of
a
friend
where
i
can
make
a
new
start
and
forget
that
i
ever
went
to
washington
langdon
paused
deliberately
the
senate
was
hushed
the
galleries
were
stifled
not
even
the
rustle
of
a
sheet
of
paper
was
heard
in
the
reporters
gallery
the
mississippian
gazed
around
the
senate
chamber
he
saw
stevens
and
peabody
craning
their
necks
across
the
aisle
and
talking
excitedly
to
each
other
then
he
stepped
forward
and
spoke
waving
the
paper
in
the
air
this
letter
is
signed
norton
the
old
southerner
gazed
triumphantly
at
the
men
who
had
sought
to
destroy
him
it
was
with
difficulty
that
the
presiding
officer
could
hammer
down
the
burst
of
handclapping
that
arose
from
the
galleries
senator
horton
however
was
not
satisfied
with
langdon
sudden
ascendency
how
do
we
know
that
that
letter
is
not
a
forgery
a
trick
he
exclaimed
go
get
congressman
norton
if
you
can
and
get
his
denial
responded
langdon
the
junior
senator
from
mississippi
hurriedly
pushed
his
way
out
of
the
senate
chamber
his
day
work
was
done
down
on
a
broad
plantation
along
the
pearl
river
an
old
planter
who
has
borne
his
years
well
as
life
goes
nowadays
passes
his
days
contentedly
he
delights
in
the
rompings
of
his
grandchildren
as
they
rouse
the
echoes
of
the
mansion
and
prides
himself
on
the
achievements
of
their
father
randolph
who
has
improved
the
plantation
to
a
point
never
reached
before
sometimes
he
receives
a
letter
from
his
daughter
hope
georgia
now
haines
telling
him
of
her
happy
life
or
perhaps
it
is
a
letter
from
carolina
describing
the
good
times
she
is
having
in
london
with
the
friends
she
is
visiting
and
the
old
planter
goes
out
on
the
broad
veranda
in
the
warm
southern
twilight
and
he
thinks
of
the
days
that
were
he
remembers
how
the
third
mississippi
won
the
day
at
crawfordsville
he
thinks
of
the
days
when
he
fought
the
good
fight
in
washington
his
thoughts
turn
to
the
memory
of
her
who
went
before
these
many
years
and
whom
he
is
soon
to
see
again
and
peace
descends
on
the
soul
of
the
gentleman
from
mississippi
as
the
world
drops
to
slumber
around
him
the
end
