notice
to
parents
although
this
little
book
and
its
fellow
at
work
are
intended
principally
as
a
means
of
entertainment
for
their
little
readers
it
is
hoped
by
the
writer
that
they
may
aid
in
accomplishing
some
of
the
following
useful
purposes
in
cultivating
thinking
powers
as
frequent
occasions
occur
in
which
the
incidents
of
the
narrative
and
the
conversations
arising
from
them
are
intended
to
awaken
and
engage
the
reasoning
and
reflective
faculties
of
the
little
readers
in
promoting
the
progress
of
children
and
in
knowledge
of
language
for
the
diction
of
the
stories
is
intended
to
be
often
in
advance
of
the
natural
language
of
the
reader
and
yet
so
used
as
to
be
explained
by
the
connection
in
cultivating
the
and
gentle
qualities
of
the
the
scenes
are
laid
in
quiet
and
virtuous
life
and
the
character
and
conduct
described
are
the
exception
of
some
of
the
ordinary
exhibitions
of
childish
and
conduct
to
be
imitated
for
it
is
generally
better
in
dealing
with
children
to
allure
them
to
what
is
right
by
agreeable
pictures
of
it
than
to
attempt
to
drive
them
to
it
by
repulsive
delineations
of
what
is
wrong
rollo
at
play
in
the
woods
the
setting
out
one
pleasant
morning
in
the
autumn
when
rollo
was
about
five
years
old
he
was
sitting
on
the
platform
behind
his
house
playing
he
had
a
hammer
and
nails
and
some
small
pieces
of
board
he
was
trying
to
make
a
box
he
hammered
and
hammered
and
presently
he
dropped
his
work
down
and
said
fretfully
dear
me
is
the
matter
rollo
said
jonas
it
happened
that
jonas
was
going
by
just
then
with
a
wheelbarrow
wish
these
little
boards
would
not
split
so
i
can
not
make
my
drive
the
nails
wrong
you
put
the
wedge
sides
the
wedge
sides
said
rollo
are
the
wedge
sides
the
grain
i
do
not
know
what
you
but
jonas
went
on
trundling
his
wheelbarrow
though
he
looked
round
and
told
rollo
that
he
could
not
stop
to
explain
it
to
him
then
rollo
was
discouraged
about
his
box
he
thought
he
would
look
and
see
what
jonas
was
going
to
do
jonas
trundled
the
wheelbarrow
along
until
he
came
opposite
the
and
there
he
put
it
down
he
went
into
the
barn
and
presently
came
out
with
an
axe
then
he
took
the
sides
of
the
wheelbarrow
off
and
placed
them
up
against
the
barn
then
he
laid
the
axe
down
across
the
wheelbarrow
and
went
into
the
barn
again
pretty
soon
he
brought
out
an
iron
crowbar
and
laid
that
down
also
in
the
wheelbarrow
with
the
axe
then
rollo
called
out
jonas
where
are
you
going
am
going
down
into
the
woods
beyond
the
are
you
going
to
do
am
going
to
clear
up
some
i
go
with
you
should
like
that
is
not
for
me
to
rollo
knew
by
this
that
he
must
ask
his
mother
he
went
in
and
asked
her
and
she
in
return
asked
him
if
he
had
read
his
lesson
that
morning
he
said
he
had
not
he
had
forgotten
it
said
his
mother
must
first
go
and
read
a
quarter
of
an
rollo
was
sadly
disappointed
and
also
a
little
displeased
he
turned
away
hung
down
his
head
and
began
to
cry
it
is
not
strange
that
he
was
disappointed
but
it
was
very
wrong
for
him
to
feel
displeased
and
begin
to
cry
here
my
son
said
his
mother
rollo
came
to
his
mother
and
she
said
to
him
kindly
have
done
wrong
now
twice
this
morning
you
have
neglected
your
duty
of
reading
and
now
you
are
out
of
humor
with
me
because
i
require
you
to
attend
to
it
now
it
is
duty
not
to
yield
to
such
feelings
as
you
have
now
but
to
punish
them
so
i
must
say
that
instead
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
you
must
wait
an
hour
before
you
go
out
with
rollo
stood
silent
a
minute
perceived
that
he
had
done
wrong
and
was
sorry
he
did
not
know
how
he
could
find
jonas
in
the
woods
but
he
did
not
say
any
thing
about
that
then
he
only
asked
his
mother
what
he
must
do
for
the
half
hour
she
said
he
must
read
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
the
rest
of
the
time
he
might
do
as
he
pleased
so
rollo
took
his
book
and
went
out
and
sat
down
upon
the
platform
and
began
to
read
aloud
when
he
had
finished
one
page
which
usually
took
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
went
in
to
ask
his
mother
what
time
it
was
she
looked
at
the
clock
and
told
him
he
had
been
reading
seventeen
minutes
seventeen
minutes
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
not
so
much
asked
rollo
is
more
minutes
is
a
quarter
of
an
hour
now
you
may
do
what
you
please
till
the
other
quarter
has
rollo
thought
he
would
go
and
read
more
it
is
true
he
was
tired
but
he
was
sorry
he
had
done
wrong
and
he
thought
that
if
he
read
more
than
he
was
obliged
to
his
mother
would
see
that
he
penitent
and
that
he
acquiesced
in
his
punishment
so
he
went
on
reading
and
the
rest
of
the
half
hour
passed
away
very
quickly
in
fact
his
mother
came
out
before
he
got
up
from
his
reading
to
tell
him
it
was
time
for
him
to
go
she
said
she
was
very
glad
he
had
submitted
pleasantly
to
his
punishment
and
she
gave
him
something
wrapped
up
in
a
paper
this
till
you
get
a
little
tired
of
play
down
there
and
then
sit
down
on
a
log
and
open
rollo
wondered
what
it
was
he
took
it
gladly
and
began
to
go
but
in
a
minute
he
turned
round
and
said
how
shall
i
find
jonas
is
he
doing
said
his
mother
said
he
was
going
to
clear
up
some
you
will
hear
his
axe
go
down
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
listen
and
when
you
hear
him
call
him
but
you
must
not
go
into
the
woods
unless
you
hear
bridge
building
rollo
went
on
down
the
green
lane
till
he
came
to
the
and
then
went
through
into
the
field
he
then
followed
a
winding
path
until
he
came
to
the
edge
of
the
trees
and
there
stopped
to
listen
he
heard
the
brook
gurgling
along
over
the
stones
and
that
was
all
at
first
but
presently
he
began
to
hear
the
strokes
of
an
axe
he
called
out
as
loud
as
he
could
jonas
but
jonas
did
not
hear
then
he
walked
along
the
edge
of
the
woods
till
he
came
nearer
the
place
where
he
heard
the
axe
he
found
here
a
little
opening
among
the
trees
and
bushes
so
that
he
could
look
in
he
saw
the
brook
and
over
beyond
it
on
the
opposite
bank
was
jonas
cutting
down
a
small
tree
so
rollo
walked
on
until
he
came
to
the
brook
and
then
asked
jonas
how
he
should
get
over
the
brook
was
pretty
wide
and
deep
jonas
said
if
he
would
wait
a
few
minutes
he
would
build
him
a
bridge
can
not
build
a
bridge
said
rollo
a
little
and
so
rollo
sat
down
on
a
mossy
bank
and
jonas
having
cut
down
the
small
tree
began
to
work
on
a
larger
one
that
stood
near
the
bank
after
he
had
cut
a
little
while
rollo
asked
him
why
he
did
not
begin
the
bridge
am
beginning
it
said
he
rollo
laughed
at
this
but
in
a
minute
jonas
called
to
him
to
stand
back
away
from
the
bank
and
then
after
a
few
strokes
more
the
top
of
the
tree
began
to
bend
slowly
over
and
then
it
fell
faster
and
faster
until
it
came
down
with
a
great
crash
directly
across
the
brook
said
jonas
is
your
rollo
looked
at
it
with
astonishment
and
pleasure
said
jonas
will
come
and
help
you
said
rollo
can
come
over
myself
i
can
take
hold
of
the
branches
for
a
so
rollo
began
to
climb
along
the
stem
of
the
tree
holding
on
carefully
by
the
branches
when
he
reached
the
middle
of
the
stream
he
stopped
to
look
down
into
the
water
is
a
capital
bridge
of
yours
jonas
said
he
beautiful
the
water
looks
down
here
o
i
see
a
little
fish

is
swimming
along
by
a
great
rock
now
he
is
standing
perfectly
still
o
jonas
come
and
see
said
jonas
must
mind
my
after
a
little
time
rollo
went
carefully
on
over
the
bridge
and
sat
down
on
the
bank
of
the
brook
but
he
did
not
have
with
him
the
parcel
his
mother
gave
him
he
had
left
it
on
the
other
side
after
he
had
watched
the
fishes
and
thrown
into
the
brook
some
time
he
began
to
be
tired
and
he
asked
jonas
what
he
had
better
do
think
you
had
better
build
a
wigwam
what
is
a
wigwam
said
rollo
is
a
little
house
made
of
bushes
such
as
the
indians
live
i
could
not
make
a
house
said
rollo
think
you
could
if
i
should
tell
you
how
and
help
you
a
you
say
must
mind
your
can
mind
my
work
and
tell
you
at
the
same
rollo
thought
he
should
like
to
build
a
wigwam
very
much
jonas
told
him
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
find
a
good
place
where
the
ground
was
level
rollo
looked
at
a
good
many
places
but
at
last
chose
a
smooth
spot
under
a
great
oak
tree
which
jonas
said
he
was
not
going
to
cut
down
it
was
near
a
beautiful
turn
in
the
brook
where
the
water
was
very
deep
jonas
told
him
that
the
first
thing
was
to
make
a
little
stake
and
drive
it
down
in
the
middle
of
his
then
rollo
recollected
that
he
had
left
his
hatchet
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
brook
together
with
the
parcel
his
mother
gave
him
and
he
was
going
over
to
get
them
when
jonas
told
him
he
would
trim
up
the
bridge
a
little
and
then
he
could
go
over
more
easily
so
jonas
went
upon
the
bridge
and
began
to
cut
away
the
branches
that
were
in
the
way
leaving
enough
on
each
side
to
take
hold
of
and
to
keep
rollo
from
falling
in
rollo
could
then
go
back
and
forth
easily
he
held
on
with
one
hand
and
carried
his
hatchet
in
the
other
then
he
went
over
again
and
brought
his
parcel
and
laid
it
down
near
the
great
oak
tree
then
he
made
a
little
stake
and
drove
it
down
in
the
middle
of
the
then
he
asked
jonas
what
he
must
do
next
is
the
centre
of
your
wigwam
now
you
must
strike
a
circle
around
said
rollo
you
know
how
to
strike
a
circle
said
jonas
rollo
said
he
did
not
and
then
jonas
told
him
to
do
exactly
as
he
should
say
and
that
would
show
him
said
jonas
you
got
a
string
rollo
felt
in
his
pockets
in
vain
but
he
recollected
his
little
parcel
which
was
tied
with
a
piece
of
twine
and
held
it
up
to
ask
jonas
if
that
would
do
jonas
said
it
would
and
told
him
to
take
it
off
carefully
and
tie
one
end
of
it
to
his
centre
stake
and
rollo
did
so
said
jonas
another
little
sharp
stake
for
the
marker
and
tie
the
other
end
of
the
twine
to
that
near
the
sharp
rollo
worked
busily
for
some
time
and
then
called
out
it
is
all
this
time
jonas
was
at
work
in
the
bushes
at
a
little
distance
he
now
came
to
and
took
hold
of
the
marker
and
held
it
off
as
far
from
the
middle
stake
as
it
would
go
and
then
began
to
make
a
mark
on
the
ground
all
around
the
middle
stake
now
as
the
marker
was
tied
to
the
middle
stake
by
the
string
the
mark
was
equally
distant
from
the
middle
stake
in
every
part
and
that
made
it
exactly
round
then
jonas
laid
down
the
marker
and
pulled
out
the
middle
stake
and
they
looked
down
and
saw
that
there
was
a
round
mark
on
the
ground
about
as
large
as
a
then
jonas
took
the
crowbar
and
made
deep
holes
all
around
in
this
circle
so
far
apart
that
rollo
could
just
step
from
one
to
the
other
but
rollo
could
not
understand
how
he
could
make
a
house
so
will
tell
you
said
jonas
must
now
go
and
get
some
large
branches
of
trees
and
trim
off
the
twigs
from
the
lower
end
and
stick
them
down
in
these
holes
i
will
show
you
so
jonas
took
a
large
bough
and
trimmed
the
large
end
and
sharpened
it
a
little
and
then
he
fixed
it
down
in
one
of
these
holes
in
such
a
manner
that
the
top
of
it
bent
over
towards
the
middle
of
the
circle
then
he
went
back
to
his
work
leaving
rollo
to
go
on
with
the
wigwam
a
visitor
rollo
put
down
two
or
three
branches
very
well
and
was
very
much
delighted
at
seeing
it
gradually
begin
to
look
like
a
house
when
he
thought
he
heard
a
voice
he
listened
a
moment
and
heard
some
one
at
a
distance
calling
rollo
dropped
his
hatchet
and
looked
in
the
direction
that
the
sound
came
from
and
called
out
as
loud
as
he
could
was
heard
in
reply
rollo
answered
and
then
immediately
clambered
along
over
the
bridge
and
ran
through
the
woods
until
he
came
out
into
the
open
field
and
there
he
saw
a
small
boy
away
off
at
a
distance
just
coming
through
the
it
was
his
cousin
james
it
seems
that
james
had
come
to
play
with
him
that
day
and
mother
had
directed
him
down
towards
the
woods
james
came
running
along
towards
rollo
holding
up
something
round
and
bright
in
each
hand
they
were
half
dollars
did
you
get
them
said
rollo
is
for
you
and
one
is
for
me
said
james
george
sent
them
to
a
beautiful
little
eagle
said
rollo
as
he
looked
at
one
side
of
his
half
dollar
wish
i
could
get
it
off
and
keep
it
no
said
james
would
spoil
your
half
they
would
know
it
was
a
half
dollar
by
the
letters
and
the
head
on
the
other
side
what
a
pretty
thin
eagle
how
do
you
suppose
they
fasten
it
on
so
strong
james
said
he
thought
he
could
get
it
off
so
they
went
and
sat
down
on
a
smooth
log
that
was
lying
on
the
ground
and
laid
half
dollar
on
the
log
then
he
took
a
pin
and
tried
to
drive
the
point
of
it
under
the
head
with
a
small
stone
but
the
eagle
would
not
move
they
only
made
some
little
marks
and
scratches
on
the
silver
mind
said
rollo
will
keep
it
as
it
so
he
took
his
half
dollar
and
they
walked
along
towards
the
brook
they
showed
their
money
to
jonas
and
told
him
that
they
had
tried
to
get
the
eagle
off
he
smiled
at
this
the
boys
went
back
soon
to
the
wigwam
and
james
said
he
would
help
rollo
finish
it
while
they
were
at
work
they
put
their
money
on
a
large
flat
stone
on
the
brink
of
the
brook
they
fixed
a
great
many
boughs
into
their
wigwam
weaving
them
in
all
around
and
thus
made
a
very
pleasant
little
house
leaving
a
place
for
a
door
in
front
when
they
were
tired
they
went
and
opened
little
package
and
found
a
fine
luncheon
in
it
of
bread
and
butter
and
pie
which
they
ate
very
happily
together
sitting
on
little
hemlock
branches
in
the
wigwam
difficulty
after
their
luncheon
the
boys
began
to
talk
about
the
best
place
for
a
window
for
the
wigwam
think
we
will
have
it
side
towards
the
brook
said
james
then
we
can
look
out
to
the
said
rollo
will
be
better
to
have
it
towards
where
jonas
is
working
and
then
we
can
look
out
and
see
said
james
is
not
a
good
plan
i
do
not
want
to
see
i
do
not
want
to
see
the
water
replied
rollo
is
wigwam
and
i
mean
to
have
the
window
so
saying
he
went
to
the
side
towards
jonas
and
began
to
take
away
a
bough
james
came
there
too
and
said
angrily
wigwam
is
mine
as
much
as
it
is
yours
for
i
helped
make
it
and
i
will
not
have
a
window
so
he
took
hold
of
the
branch
that
rollo
had
hold
of
they
both
felt
guilty
and
condemned
but
their
angry
feelings
urged
them
on
and
they
looked
fiercely
at
each
other
and
pulled
upon
the
branch
said
james
said
rollo
tell
you
let
my
wigwam
is
not
your
tell
you
it
just
then
they
heard
a
noise
in
the
bushes
they
looked
around
and
saw
jonas
coming
towards
them
they
felt
ashamed
and
were
silent
though
each
kept
hold
of
the
branch
boys
said
jonas
have
got
into
a
foolish
and
wicked
quarrel
i
have
heard
it
all
now
you
may
do
as
you
may
let
me
settle
it
or
i
will
lead
you
home
to
your
mother
and
tell
her
about
it
and
let
her
settle
the
boys
looked
ashamed
but
said
nothing
you
conclude
to
let
me
settle
it
you
must
do
just
as
i
say
but
i
do
not
pretend
that
i
have
any
right
to
decide
such
a
case
unless
you
consent
so
i
will
take
you
home
if
you
the
boys
both
preferred
that
he
should
settle
it
and
promised
to
do
as
he
should
say
then
said
he
first
thing
is
for
you
rollo
to
go
over
the
other
side
of
the
brook
and
you
james
to
stay
here
and
both
to
sit
down
still
until
you
have
had
time
to
the
boys
obeyed
and
jonas
went
back
to
his
work
the
boys
sat
still
feeling
guilty
and
ashamed
but
they
were
not
penitent
they
ought
to
have
been
sorry
for
their
fault
and
become
and
pleasant
again
but
instead
of
that
they
were
silent
and
displeased
eyeing
one
another
across
the
brook
jonas
waited
some
time
and
then
came
and
called
them
both
to
him
says
james
will
tell
you
all
about
it
and
you
shall
decide
who
was
to
heard
it
all
and
i
know
which
was
to
blame
you
james
came
here
to
see
rollo
and
found
him
building
a
wigwam
it
was
wigwam
not
he
began
it
without
you
and
was
going
on
without
you
and
when
you
came
you
had
no
right
to
assume
any
authority
about
it
you
ought
to
have
let
him
do
as
he
wished
with
his
own
wigwam
you
were
here
rollo
began
to
look
pleased
and
triumphant
that
jonas
had
decided
in
his
favor
continued
jonas
rollo
were
playing
here
alone
your
little
cousin
came
to
see
you
and
you
were
very
glad
to
have
him
come
he
helped
you
build
and
when
he
wanted
to
have
the
window
in
a
particular
way
you
ought
to
have
let
him
to
quarrel
with
a
visitor
for
such
a
cause
as
that
was
very
ungentlemanly
and
unkind
so
you
see
you
were
both
very
much
to
the
boys
looked
guilty
and
ashamed
but
they
did
not
feel
really
penitent
they
were
not
cordially
reconciled
neither
was
willing
to
give
up
said
rollo
shall
we
make
the
window
think
you
ought
not
to
make
any
window
as
you
can
not
agree
about
they
wanted
to
make
a
window
now
more
than
ever
for
each
wanted
to
have
his
own
way
but
jonas
would
not
consent
and
as
they
had
agreed
to
abide
by
his
decision
they
submitted
jonas
then
returned
to
his
work
and
the
boys
stood
by
the
side
of
the
brook
not
knowing
exactly
what
to
do
jonas
told
them
when
they
went
away
that
he
expected
that
they
would
have
another
quarrel
as
he
perceived
that
their
hearts
were
still
in
a
bad
state
hearts
wrong
the
boys
sat
down
on
the
bank
of
the
brook
and
began
to
pick
up
little
stones
and
throw
them
into
the
water
they
began
soon
to
talk
of
the
window
again
rollo
said
thought
you
were
most
to
blame
i
he
did
not
replied
james
blamed
you
the
most
he
said
you
were
care
said
rollo
do
not
know
how
to
build
a
wigwam
you
can
not
reach
high
enough
to
make
a
reach
high
said
james
can
reach
as
high
as
that
said
he
stretching
up
his
hand
i
can
reach
as
high
as
said
rollo
stretching
up
his
hand
higher
than
james
did
for
he
was
a
little
taller
james
was
somewhat
vexed
to
find
that
rollo
could
reach
higher
than
he
could
though
it
was
very
foolish
to
allow
himself
to
be
put
out
of
humor
by
such
a
thing
but
boys
when
they
are
and
dispute
are
always
unreasonable
and
foolish
james
determined
not
to
be
outdone
so
he
took
up
a
stick
and
reached
it
up
in
the
air
as
high
as
he
could
and
said
can
reach
up
as
high
as
then
rollo
took
up
a
stone
and
tossed
it
up
into
the
air
saying
i
can
reach
as
high
as
now
when
boys
throw
stones
into
the
air
they
ought
to
consider
where
they
will
come
down
but
unfortunately
rollo
did
not
in
this
case
and
the
stone
fell
directly
upon
head
it
was
however
a
small
stone
and
his
cap
prevented
it
from
hurting
him
much
but
he
was
already
vexed
and
out
of
humor
and
so
he
began
to
cry
out
aloud
rollo
was
frightened
a
little
for
he
was
afraid
he
had
hurt
his
cousin
a
good
deal
and
then
he
expected
too
that
jonas
would
come
but
jonas
took
no
notice
of
the
crying
but
went
on
with
his
work
now
jonas
was
very
kind
and
careful
and
always
came
quick
when
there
was
any
one
hurt
but
this
time
he
knew
by
the
tone
of
crying
that
it
was
vexation
rather
than
pain
that
caused
it
james
finding
that
his
crying
did
no
good
gradually
became
still
and
in
a
few
minutes
as
he
happened
to
look
round
his
eye
rested
on
the
stone
where
they
had
put
their
half
dollars
and
he
saw
that
only
one
of
them
was
there
rollo
said
he
of
our
half
dollars
is
they
went
to
the
stone
and
true
enough
one
was
gone
they
looked
around
but
it
was
no
where
to
be
found
boys
that
are
out
of
humor
with
one
another
are
never
at
a
loss
for
subjects
of
dispute
and
rollo
said
he
believed
james
had
taken
it
and
james
charged
it
upon
rollo
then
there
was
a
dispute
who
should
have
the
one
that
was
left
james
knew
it
was
his
he
said
he
remembered
how
his
looked
and
rollo
knew
it
was
his
for
the
head
and
the
stars
were
very
bright
on
his
and
they
were
very
bright
on
this
james
however
had
the
half
dollar
and
would
not
give
it
up
and
so
rollo
went
to
jonas
and
told
him
that
james
had
got
his
half
dollar
jonas
came
and
heard
the
whole
story
from
both
of
the
boys
james
said
he
the
one
that
was
left
was
his
for
he
remembered
exactly
how
it
looked
and
he
also
remembered
exactly
the
very
spot
on
the
stone
where
he
put
it
down
james
did
not
mean
to
tell
a
lie
but
he
was
a
little
angry
and
excited
and
when
boys
are
in
that
state
of
mind
they
are
very
apt
to
say
they
know
not
what
jonas
looked
at
both
sides
of
the
half
dollar
very
attentively
half
dollar
was
it
said
he
you
tried
to
get
the
eagle
off
of
said
rollo
me
jonas
held
down
the
half
dollar
and
showed
to
rollo
and
james
the
marks
and
scratches
made
by
the
pin
proving
that
this
was
half
dollar
james
looked
ashamed
and
confounded
jonas
just
waited
to
hear
what
he
would
say
hearts
right
again
james
stood
still
a
minute
thinking
presently
he
said
rollo
i
suppose
my
half
dollar
is
lost
but
i
am
glad
yours
is
safe
at
any
am
sorry
yours
is
lost
said
rollo
then
i
can
give
you
half
of
what
i
buy
with
did
you
put
the
half
dollars
said
jonas
that
rock
said
rollo
they
walked
along
towards
the
rock
it
was
by
the
edge
of
the
water
jonas
thought
that
as
they
had
been
dragging
boughs
of
trees
along
near
the
rock
some
little
branch
might
have
reached
over
and
brushed
off
one
of
the
pieces
of
money
into
the
water
so
he
walked
up
to
it
and
looked
over
in
a
minute
or
two
he
pointed
down
and
the
boys
looked
and
saw
something
bright
and
glittering
on
the
bottom
that
it
said
james
believe
it
is
said
jonas
jonas
then
took
off
his
jacket
rolled
up
his
shirt
sleeve
lay
down
on
the
rock
and
reached
his
arm
down
into
the
water
but
it
was
a
little
too
deep
he
could
not
reach
it
can
not
get
it
so
said
he
shall
we
do
said
james
foolish
i
was
to
put
it
so
near
the
water
think
we
shall
contrive
some
way
to
get
it
said
jonas
he
then
sat
down
on
the
rock
and
looked
into
the
water
can
go
home
and
get
a
long
pair
of
tongs
and
get
it
with
them
at
any
rate
said
he
yes
said
rollo
will
go
and
get
them
and
he
ran
off
towards
the
bridge
said
jonas
i
will
try
one
plan
so
he
went
and
cut
a
long
straight
stem
of
a
bush
and
trimmed
it
up
smooth
and
cut
the
largest
end
off
exactly
square
then
he
went
to
a
hemlock
tree
near
and
took
off
some
of
the
gum
which
was
very
he
pressed
some
of
this
with
his
knife
on
the
end
of
the
stick
then
he
reached
it
very
carefully
down
and
pressed
it
hard
against
the
half
dollar
it
crowded
the
half
dollar
down
into
the
sand
out
of
sight
illustration
you
have
lost
it
said
james
know
said
jonas
and
he
began
slowly
and
carefully
to
draw
it
up
when
the
end
of
the
stick
came
up
out
of
the
sand
the
boys
saw
to
their
great
delight
that
the
half
dollar
was
sticking
fast
on
they
clapped
their
hands
and
capered
about
on
the
stone
while
jonas
gently
drew
up
the
half
dollar
and
put
it
all
wet
and
dripping
into
hand
the
boys
thanked
jonas
for
getting
up
the
money
and
then
they
asked
him
to
keep
both
pieces
for
them
until
they
went
home
then
they
began
to
think
of
the
wigwam
again
will
make
the
window
as
you
want
it
james
said
rollo
am
said
james
was
just
going
to
say
we
would
make
it
your
way
i
rather
think
it
would
be
better
to
make
it
towards
the
can
you
not
have
two
windows
said
jonas
we
can
said
both
of
the
boys
and
they
immediately
went
to
work
collecting
branches
and
weaving
them
in
leaving
a
space
for
a
window
both
sides
their
quarrelsome
feelings
were
all
gone
and
they
talked
very
pleasantly
at
their
work
until
it
was
time
for
them
to
go
home
to
dinner
illustration
they
went
to
work
collecting
branches
and
weaving
them
in
the
steeple
trap
the
way
to
catch
a
squirrel
the
afternoon
of
the
day
when
rollo
and
his
cousin
james
made
their
wigwam
in
the
woods
by
the
brook
they
were
at
work
there
again
employed
very
harmoniously
together
in
finishing
their
edifice
when
suddenly
jonas
who
was
at
work
in
the
woods
at
a
little
distance
heard
them
both
calling
to
him
in
tones
of
surprise
and
jonas
jonas
come
here
jonas
dropped
his
axe
and
ran
when
he
got
near
them
they
pointed
to
a
log
there
is
it
said
jonas
i
see
it
said
he
it
was
a
little
squirrel
clambering
up
a
eating
the
raspberries
as
he
went
along
he
would
climb
up
by
the
little
branches
and
pull
in
the
raspberries
in
succession
until
he
got
to
the
topmost
one
when
the
bush
would
bend
over
with
his
weight
until
it
almost
touched
the
log
us
catch
him
said
rollo
very
eagerly
let
us
catch
him
i
will
go
and
get
our
steeple
jonas
did
not
seem
to
be
so
very
much
delighted
as
the
boys
were
he
said
he
was
certainly
a
cunning
little
fellow
but
should
we
do
with
him
if
we
should
catch
him
said
rollo
would
put
him
in
a
little
cage
it
would
be
so
complete
to
have
him
in
a
cage
do
jonas
you
have
not
got
any
can
get
one
said
james
can
buy
one
with
our
half
said
jonas
will
do
no
good
to
set
the
trap
now
for
he
will
be
away
before
we
could
get
back
but
i
will
come
down
and
set
the
trap
and
perhaps
we
shall
catch
him
though
i
do
not
exactly
like
to
do
said
the
boys
replied
jonas
will
not
like
to
be
shut
up
all
night
in
a
dark
box
and
then
be
imprisoned
in
a
cage
he
had
rather
run
about
here
and
gather
raspberries
besides
you
would
soon
get
tired
of
him
if
you
had
him
in
a
no
said
rollo
should
not
get
tired
of
you
ever
have
any
plaything
that
you
were
not
tired
of
before
long
said
rollo
then
a
real
live
squirrel
is
a
different
thing
besides
you
know
if
i
get
tired
of
him
i
need
not
play
with
him
but
a
real
live
thing
must
be
fed
every
day
and
you
would
find
a
great
trouble
and
then
you
would
sometimes
forget
it
and
the
poor
fellow
would
be
half
no
said
rollo
am
sure
i
should
not
forget
you
remember
your
this
morning
said
rollo
looking
a
little
confused
i
am
sure
i
should
not
forget
to
feed
a
squirrel
if
i
had
know
as
much
as
i
thought
you
did
replied
jonas
thought
you
knew
more
about
yourself
than
to
suppose
you
could
be
trusted
to
do
any
thing
regularly
every
day
why
you
would
not
remember
to
wash
your
own
face
every
morning
if
your
mother
did
not
remind
you
the
squirrel
is
almost
as
fit
to
take
care
of
you
in
your
wigwam
as
you
are
to
take
care
of
him
in
a
rollo
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
his
boasting
for
he
knew
that
what
jonas
said
was
true
jonas
said
finally
we
will
try
to
catch
him
but
i
can
not
promise
that
i
shall
let
you
keep
him
in
a
cage
it
will
be
bad
enough
for
him
to
be
shut
up
all
night
in
the
box
trap
but
i
can
pay
him
for
that
the
next
day
in
so
jonas
brought
down
the
box
trap
that
night
it
was
a
long
box
about
as
big
as
a
cricket
with
a
tall
pointed
back
which
looked
like
a
steeple
so
rollo
called
it
the
steeple
trap
it
was
so
made
that
if
the
squirrel
should
go
in
and
begin
to
nibble
some
corn
which
they
were
going
to
put
in
there
it
would
make
the
cover
come
down
and
shut
him
in
they
fixed
the
trap
on
the
end
of
the
log
and
jonas
observed
as
he
sat
on
the
log
that
he
could
see
the
barn
chamber
window
through
a
little
opening
among
the
trees
of
course
he
knew
that
from
the
barn
chamber
window
he
could
see
the
trap
though
it
would
be
too
far
off
to
see
it
plain
the
way
to
lose
a
squirrel
early
the
next
morning
james
came
over
to
learn
whether
they
had
caught
the
squirrel
and
he
and
rollo
wanted
jonas
to
go
down
with
them
and
see
jonas
said
he
could
not
go
down
then
very
well
but
if
he
would
go
and
ask
his
father
to
lend
him
his
he
could
tell
without
going
down
now
jonas
had
been
a
very
faithful
and
obedient
boy
ever
since
he
came
to
live
with
father
he
had
some
great
faults
when
he
first
came
but
he
had
cured
himself
of
them
and
he
was
now
an
excellent
and
trustworthy
boy
it
was
a
part
of
his
business
to
take
care
of
rollo
and
they
always
let
him
have
what
he
asked
for
from
the
house
as
they
knew
it
was
for
some
good
purpose
and
that
it
would
be
well
taken
care
of
so
when
rollo
went
in
and
asked
for
the
and
said
that
jonas
wanted
it
they
handed
it
down
to
him
at
once
jonas
took
the
glass
and
they
all
three
went
up
into
the
barn
chamber
jonas
opened
the
glass
and
held
it
up
to
his
eye
the
boys
stood
by
looking
on
silently
at
length
jonas
said
we
have
not
caught
do
you
know
said
the
boys
i
can
see
the
trap
and
it
is
not
not
sprung
said
james
do
you
mean
by
it
is
not
shut
i
can
see
it
open
and
of
course
the
squirrel
is
not
he
may
be
in
said
rollo
nibbling
the
corn
do
let
us
go
and
jonas
smiled
and
said
he
could
not
go
then
but
he
would
look
through
the
again
towards
noon
he
then
gave
the
glass
to
rollo
and
it
was
carried
back
safely
into
the
house
james
soon
after
went
home
and
rollo
sat
down
in
the
parlor
to
his
reading
afterwards
he
came
out
and
went
to
building
cities
in
a
sandy
corner
of
the
garden
he
was
making
rome
his
father
had
told
him
that
rome
was
built
on
seven
hills
and
he
liked
to
make
the
seven
hills
in
the
sand
he
made
a
long
channel
for
an
aqueduct
and
went
into
the
house
to
get
a
dipper
of
water
to
fill
his
aqueduct
when
he
met
james
coming
again
so
they
went
in
and
got
the
and
asked
jonas
to
go
up
and
look
again
jonas
adjusted
the
glass
held
it
up
to
his
eye
and
looked
some
time
in
silence
and
then
said
it
is
sprung
i
believe
yes
it
is
certainly
then
we
have
caught
him
said
the
boys
capering
about
us
go
and
we
have
caught
him
said
jonas
it
is
not
certain
sometimes
the
trap
gets
sprung
accidentally
however
you
may
go
and
ask
your
father
if
he
thinks
it
worth
while
for
me
to
leave
my
work
long
enough
to
go
down
and
illustration
rollo
came
back
with
the
permission
granted
and
they
all
set
off
rollo
and
james
running
on
eagerly
before
when
they
came
to
the
trap
they
found
it
shut
jonas
took
it
up
and
tipped
it
one
way
and
the
other
and
listened
he
heard
something
moving
in
it
but
did
not
know
whether
it
was
anything
more
than
the
corn
cob
then
he
said
he
would
open
the
trap
a
very
little
and
let
rollo
peep
in
he
did
so
rollo
said
it
looked
all
dark
he
could
not
see
any
thing
then
jonas
opened
it
a
little
farther
and
rollo
saw
two
little
shining
eyes
and
presently
a
nose
smelling
along
at
the
crack
here
he
is
here
he
is
said
rollo
at
him
james
look
at
him
they
all
peeped
at
him
and
then
jonas
took
the
box
under
his
arm
and
they
returned
home
jonas
told
the
boys
he
was
not
willing
to
keep
the
squirrel
a
prisoner
very
long
but
he
would
try
to
contrive
some
way
by
which
they
might
look
at
him
now
there
was
in
the
garret
a
small
which
had
been
laid
aside
as
old
and
useless
jonas
recollected
this
and
thought
he
could
fix
up
a
temporary
cage
with
it
so
he
took
a
small
box
about
as
large
as
a
which
he
found
in
the
barn
and
laid
it
down
on
its
side
so
as
to
turn
the
open
side
towards
the
trap
and
then
moved
the
trap
close
up
to
it
he
then
covered
up
all
the
rest
of
the
open
part
of
the
box
with
shingles
and
asked
james
and
rollo
to
hold
them
on
then
he
carefully
lifted
up
the
cover
of
the
trap
and
made
a
rattling
in
the
back
part
of
it
with
the
spindle
this
drove
the
squirrel
through
out
of
the
trap
into
the
box
when
jonas
was
sure
that
he
was
in
he
took
the
old
fender
and
slid
it
down
very
cautiously
between
the
trap
and
the
box
so
as
to
cover
the
open
part
entirely
and
make
a
sort
of
grated
front
like
a
cage
then
he
took
the
trap
away
and
there
the
little
was
safely
imprisoned
but
yet
fairly
exposed
to
view
that
is
they
he
was
safely
imprisoned
but
he
little
rogue
had
no
idea
of
submitting
without
giving
his
bolts
and
bars
a
try
at
first
he
crept
along
with
his
tail
curled
over
his
back
in
a
corner
and
looked
at
the
strange
faces
which
surrounded
him
us
give
him
a
little
corn
said
rollo
he
is
hungry
and
he
was
just
slipping
some
kernels
in
between
the
wires
of
the
fender
when
bunny
sprang
forward
and
with
a
jump
and
a
squeeze
forced
his
slender
body
between
two
of
the
wires
that
were
bent
a
little
apart
leaped
down
upon
the
barn
floor
ran
along
to
the
corner
up
the
post
and
then
crept
leisurely
along
on
a
beam
presently
he
stopped
and
looked
down
as
if
considering
what
to
do
next
the
moment
he
escaped
the
boys
exclaimed
catch
him
catch
him
and
were
going
to
run
after
him
but
jonas
said
that
it
would
do
no
good
for
they
could
not
catch
him
again
now
and
had
better
stand
still
and
see
what
he
would
do
he
soon
began
to
run
along
on
the
beam
thence
he
ascended
to
the
scaffold
and
made
his
way
towards
an
open
window
he
jumped
up
to
the
window
sill
and
then
disappeared
the
boys
all
ran
around
outside
and
were
just
in
time
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
running
along
on
the
top
of
the
fence
down
towards
the
woods
again
let
us
run
after
him
and
catch
him
said
rollo
him
said
jonas
with
a
laugh
might
as
well
catch
the
wind
no
the
only
way
is
to
set
our
trap
for
him
again
i
meant
to
let
him
go
myself
but
he
is
not
going
to
slip
through
our
fingers
in
that
way
i
tell
so
jonas
went
down
that
night
and
set
the
trap
again
for
several
days
after
this
the
trap
remained
unsprung
and
the
boys
began
to
think
that
they
should
never
see
him
again
at
last
however
one
day
when
rollo
was
playing
in
the
yard
he
saw
jonas
coming
up
out
of
the
woods
with
the
trap
under
his
arm
rollo
ran
to
meet
him
and
was
delighted
to
find
that
the
squirrel
was
caught
again
how
to
keep
a
squirrel
jonas
contrived
to
tighten
the
wires
of
the
lender
by
weaving
in
other
wires
so
as
to
secure
the
little
prisoner
this
time
and
when
he
was
fairly
in
his
temporary
cage
the
boys
were
so
pleased
with
his
graceful
form
and
beautiful
colors
especially
the
elegant
stripes
on
his
back
that
they
begged
hard
to
keep
him
and
they
made
many
earnest
promises
never
to
forget
to
feed
him
jonas
said
at
last
the
whole
i
believe
i
will
let
you
keep
him
but
you
must
do
it
in
my
is
your
way
after
a
day
or
two
we
must
carry
him
back
to
his
and
let
him
go
but
you
may
give
him
a
name
and
call
him
yours
and
you
can
carry
some
corn
down
there
now
and
then
to
feed
him
with
then
you
will
see
him
occasionally
playing
about
james
and
rollo
did
not
exactly
like
this
plan
at
first
but
when
they
considered
how
much
better
the
little
squirrel
himself
would
like
it
they
adopted
it
and
rollo
proposed
that
they
should
tie
a
string
round
his
neck
for
a
collar
so
that
they
might
know
him
again
can
get
mother
to
let
me
have
a
little
pink
riband
said
he
that
will
be
would
be
a
good
plan
said
jonas
mark
him
in
some
way
but
he
might
gnaw
off
the
no
said
james
could
not
gnaw
any
thing
on
his
own
rollo
thought
so
too
and
they
both
tried
to
bite
their
own
collar
ribands
by
way
of
showing
jonas
how
impossible
it
was
know
exactly
what
the
limits
are
of
a
gnawing
said
jonas
he
might
tear
it
off
with
his
he
might
get
another
squirrel
to
gnaw
it
off
for
him
said
james
said
jonas
there
is
another
difficulty
he
might
be
jumping
from
one
tree
to
another
and
catch
his
collar
in
some
little
branch
and
so
get
hung
without
judge
or
can
we
do
then
said
rollo
think
said
jonas
the
best
plan
would
be
to
dye
the
end
of
his
tail
black
that
would
not
hurt
him
any
and
yet
as
he
always
holds
his
tail
up
we
should
see
it
and
know
the
boys
both
thought
this
would
be
excellent
and
jonas
said
he
had
some
black
dye
which
he
had
made
for
dyeing
some
wood
jonas
was
a
very
ingenious
boy
and
used
to
make
little
boxes
and
frames
and
windmills
with
his
penknife
in
the
long
winter
evenings
and
he
had
made
this
dye
out
of
vinegar
and
old
nails
to
dye
some
of
his
wood
with
am
not
certain
said
jonas
my
dye
will
color
hair
i
never
tried
it
except
on
wood
do
you
think
that
black
would
be
a
pretty
color
said
rollo
would
not
be
a
very
pretty
color
but
it
would
do
yellow
and
red
and
green
are
pretty
colors
but
black
and
brown
and
white
are
not
pretty
at
have
not
got
any
yellow
or
red
or
green
said
jonas
know
but
that
i
have
got
a
little
blue
would
be
beautiful
said
james
then
jonas
walked
along
into
the
barn
and
rollo
and
james
followed
him
he
went
up
stairs
and
walked
along
to
the
farthest
corner
and
there
up
on
a
beam
were
several
small
bottles
all
in
a
row
jonas
took
down
one
and
shook
it
and
said
that
was
the
blue
he
brought
it
down
to
the
cage
rollo
went
into
the
house
and
brought
out
an
old
bowl
and
jonas
prepared
to
pour
out
the
dye
into
it
they
then
concluded
that
they
would
carry
the
whole
apparatus
down
into
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
perform
the
operation
there
and
then
the
squirrel
when
he
was
liberated
would
easily
find
his
way
back
to
his
home
jonas
carried
down
a
pair
of
thick
old
gloves
to
keep
the
squirrel
from
biting
him
as
they
walked
along
rollo
proposed
that
jonas
should
dip
the
ears
in
as
well
as
his
tail
said
he
may
sometimes
see
him
when
he
is
half
hid
in
the
bushes
so
that
only
his
head
is
in
said
james
will
make
him
look
more
beautiful
if
his
ears
and
tail
are
both
jonas
did
not
object
to
this
and
after
a
short
time
they
reached
the
edge
of
the
woods
they
found
a
little
opening
where
the
ground
was
smooth
and
the
grass
green
which
seemed
exactly
the
place
for
them
so
they
put
down
the
cage
and
the
bowl
of
dye
and
jonas
began
to
put
on
his
glove
boys
said
he
must
be
still
as
moonlight
while
i
do
it
if
you
speak
to
me
you
will
put
me
out
and
besides
you
will
frighten
little
the
boys
promised
not
to
speak
a
single
word
and
jonas
after
unfastening
the
fender
from
the
front
of
the
box
moved
it
along
until
there
was
an
opening
large
enough
for
him
to
get
his
hand
in
rollo
and
james
stood
by
silently
and
somewhat
anxiously
waiting
the
result
when
the
squirrel
saw
hand
intruding
itself
into
the
box
he
retreated
to
the
farther
corner
and
curled
himself
up
there
with
his
tail
close
down
upon
his
back
jonas
followed
him
with
his
hand
saying
in
a
soothing
tone
bunny
poor
little
he
reached
him
at
length
and
put
his
hand
very
gently
over
him
and
slowly
and
cautiously
drew
him
out
rollo
and
james
gave
a
sort
of
hysteric
laugh
and
instantly
clapped
their
hands
to
their
mouths
to
suppress
it
but
they
looked
at
one
another
and
at
jonas
with
great
delight
jonas
gradually
brought
the
squirrel
over
the
bowl
and
prepared
to
dip
his
ears
into
the
dye
it
was
a
strange
situation
for
a
squirrel
to
be
in
and
he
did
not
like
it
at
all
and
just
at
the
instant
when
his
ears
were
going
into
the
dye
he
twisted
his
head
round
and
planted
his
little
fore
teeth
directly
upon
thumb
as
might
have
been
supposed
teeth
which
were
sharp
and
powerful
enough
to
go
through
a
walnut
shell
would
not
he
likely
to
be
stopped
by
a
leathern
glove
and
jonas
startled
by
the
sudden
cut
gave
a
twitch
with
his
hand
and
at
the
same
instant
let
go
of
the
squirrel
bunny
grasped
the
edge
of
the
howl
with
his
paws
and
leaped
out
bringing
the
bowl
itself
at
the
same
instant
over
upon
him
spattering
him
all
over
from
head
to
tail
with
the
blue
dye
illustration
the
boys
looked
aghast
for
a
minute
but
when
they
saw
him
racing
off
as
fast
as
possible
and
running
up
a
neighboring
tree
jonas
burst
into
a
laugh
which
the
other
boys
joined
and
they
continued
it
loud
and
long
till
the
woods
rang
again
we
have
spotted
him
at
any
rate
said
jonas
will
call
him
the
boys
then
looked
at
bite
and
found
that
it
was
not
a
very
serious
one
in
fact
jonas
was
a
little
ashamed
at
having
let
go
for
so
small
a
wound
however
it
was
then
too
late
to
regret
it
and
the
boys
returned
slowly
home
as
they
were
walking
home
james
said
that
the
back
looked
where
the
dye
went
upon
him
but
he
did
not
think
it
looked
very
said
jonas
does
not
generally
look
blue
at
first
but
it
grows
blue
afterwards
it
will
be
a
bright
color
enough
before
you
see
him
again
i
will
so
they
walked
along
home
the
fender
was
put
back
in
its
place
in
the
garret
the
bowl
in
the
house
and
the
box
in
the
barn
jonas
soon
forgot
that
he
had
been
bitten
and
the
squirrel
as
soon
as
his
back
was
dry
thought
no
more
of
the
whole
affair
but
turned
his
attention
entirely
to
the
business
of
digging
a
hole
to
store
his
nuts
in
for
the
ensuing
winter
fires
in
the
woods
all
the
large
trees
that
jonas
had
felled
beyond
the
brook
he
cut
up
into
lengths
and
hauled
them
up
into
the
yard
and
made
a
great
high
of
them
higher
than
his
head
but
all
the
branches
and
the
small
bushes
with
all
the
green
leaves
upon
them
lay
about
the
ground
in
confusion
rollo
asked
him
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
them
he
said
after
they
were
dry
he
should
burn
them
up
and
that
they
would
make
a
splendid
bonfire
they
lay
there
drying
a
good
many
weeks
the
leaves
turned
yellow
and
brown
and
the
little
twigs
and
sticks
became
gradually
dry
and
brittle
rollo
used
to
walk
down
there
often
to
see
how
the
drying
went
on
and
sometimes
he
would
bring
up
a
few
of
the
bushes
and
put
them
on
the
kitchen
fire
to
see
whether
they
were
dry
enough
to
burn
at
last
late
in
the
autumn
one
cool
afternoon
jonas
asked
rollo
to
go
down
with
him
and
help
him
pile
up
the
bushes
in
heaps
for
he
was
going
to
burn
them
that
evening
rollo
wanted
very
much
that
his
cousins
james
and
lucy
should
see
the
fires
and
so
he
asked
his
mother
to
let
him
go
and
ask
them
to
come
and
take
tea
there
that
night
and
go
out
with
them
in
the
evening
to
the
burning
she
consented
and
rollo
went
lucy
promised
to
come
just
before
and
james
came
then
with
rollo
to
help
him
pile
the
bushes
up
jonas
said
that
the
boys
might
make
one
little
pile
of
their
own
if
they
wished
and
told
them
that
they
must
first
make
a
pile
of
solid
sticks
and
dry
rotten
logs
as
large
as
they
could
lift
or
roll
so
as
to
have
a
good
solid
fire
underneath
and
then
cover
these
up
with
brush
as
high
as
they
could
pile
it
so
as
to
make
a
great
blaze
he
told
them
also
that
they
must
make
their
pile
where
it
would
not
burn
any
of
the
trees
which
he
had
left
standing
for
he
had
left
a
great
many
of
the
large
oaks
and
beeches
and
pines
to
ornament
the
ground
and
make
a
shade
rollo
and
james
decided
to
make
their
pile
near
the
brook
between
the
bridge
which
jonas
made
of
a
tree
and
the
old
wigwam
which
they
had
made
some
time
before
of
boughs
they
got
together
a
great
heap
of
solid
wood
as
large
pieces
as
they
could
lift
and
at
one
end
they
put
in
a
great
deal
of
birch
bark
which
they
stripped
off
in
great
sheets
from
an
old
decayed
birch
tree
which
had
been
lying
on
the
ground
near
for
half
a
century
when
this
was
done
they
began
to
pile
on
the
bushes
and
brush
taking
care
to
leave
the
end
where
the
birch
bark
was
open
after
they
had
piled
it
up
as
high
as
they
could
reach
rollo
clambered
up
to
the
top
of
it
and
james
reached
the
long
bushes
up
to
him
and
he
arranged
them
regularly
with
the
tops
out
so
they
worked
all
the
afternoon
and
by
the
time
they
had
got
their
pile
done
they
found
that
jonas
had
thrown
almost
all
the
rest
of
the
bushes
into
heaps
and
then
they
went
home
to
tea
they
found
lucy
there
and
they
were
all
so
eager
to
go
to
the
bonfires
that
they
did
not
eat
much
supper
their
father
told
them
that
as
they
had
so
little
appetite
they
had
better
carry
down
some
potatoes
and
apples
and
roast
them
by
the
fires
they
thought
this
an
excellent
plan
and
ran
into
the
to
get
them
their
mother
gave
them
a
basket
to
put
the
potatoes
and
apples
into
and
a
little
salt
folded
up
in
a
paper
they
were
then
so
impatient
to
go
that
their
parents
said
they
might
set
off
with
jonas
and
they
themselves
would
come
along
very
soon
so
jonas
and
the
three
children
walked
on
rollo
carried
the
basket
and
jonas
a
lantern
and
jonas
as
he
went
along
made
with
his
penknife
some
flat
wooden
spoons
to
eat
their
potatoes
with
they
came
to
the
bridge
and
all
got
safely
over
though
lucy
was
a
little
afraid
at
first
they
played
around
there
a
few
minutes
as
the
twilight
was
coming
on
and
soon
after
they
saw
father
and
mother
coming
down
through
the
trees
on
the
other
side
of
the
brook
they
stopped
on
that
side
as
mother
did
not
like
to
come
across
the
bridge
pretty
soon
they
called
out
to
jonas
to
light
the
fires
jonas
then
took
a
large
piece
of
birch
bark
and
touched
the
corner
of
it
to
the
lamp
in
the
lantern
and
when
it
was
well
on
fire
he
laid
it
carefully
on
the
ground
the
bark
began
to
blaze
up
very
bright
sending
out
volumes
of
thick
smoke
and
dense
flame
writhing
and
curling
and
snapping
as
it
lay
on
the
ground
the
light
shone
brightly
on
the
grass
and
sticks
around
said
jonas
will
burn
some
time
now
you
may
light
your
torches
from
said
rollo
have
not
got
any
not
you
made
any
torches
o
well
will
make
you
some
in
a
so
he
took
out
his
knife
and
selected
three
long
slender
stems
of
bushes
and
trimmed
them
up
and
cut
off
the
tops
then
he
made
a
little
split
in
the
top
end
and
slipped
in
a
piece
of
birch
bark
then
he
handed
them
to
the
children
one
to
each
and
said
are
your
torches
now
you
can
light
your
fires
without
burning
your
so
they
took
their
torches
and
held
the
ends
over
the
flame
of
the
piece
of
birch
bark
which
however
had
by
this
time
nearly
burned
out
took
fire
but
and
did
not
at
first
and
as
they
pressed
their
torches
down
more
and
more
to
make
them
light
they
only
smothered
what
little
flame
was
left
and
put
it
out
dear
me
said
rollo
lucy
had
gone
a
little
way
towards
a
pile
but
when
she
saw
what
was
the
matter
she
came
back
and
said
it
by
so
the
boys
held
their
torches
over
hers
until
they
were
all
three
in
a
bright
blaze
they
then
carried
them
along
waving
them
in
the
air
and
lighting
pile
after
pile
until
the
whole
forest
seemed
to
be
in
a
flame
the
children
stood
still
a
few
moments
gazing
on
the
fires
and
on
the
extraordinary
effect
which
the
light
produced
upon
the
objects
around
it
was
a
singular
scene
flashing
and
crackling
flames
rose
high
from
the
heaps
which
were
on
fire
and
shed
a
strong
but
unsteady
light
on
the
trees
the
ground
and
the
banks
of
the
brook
and
penetrated
deep
into
the
forest
on
every
side
rollo
called
upon
james
and
lucy
to
look
at
his
father
and
mother
who
were
across
the
brook
they
stood
there
under
the
trees
almost
invisible
before
but
now
the
bright
light
shone
strongly
upon
their
faces
and
forms
and
cast
upon
them
a
clear
and
brilliant
illumination
which
was
strongly
contrasted
with
the
dark
depths
of
the
forest
behind
them
the
children
were
silent
and
stood
still
for
a
few
minutes
gazing
on
the
scene
with
feelings
of
admiration
and
awe
they
expected
to
have
capered
about
and
laughed
but
they
found
that
they
had
no
disposition
to
do
so
the
enjoyment
they
felt
was
not
of
that
kind
which
leads
children
to
caper
and
laugh
they
stood
still
and
looked
silently
and
soberly
on
the
flashing
flames
the
lurid
light
the
bright
red
reflections
on
the
woods
the
banks
and
the
water
on
the
volumes
of
glowing
smoke
and
sparks
which
ascended
to
the
sky
before
long
however
the
light
fuel
upon
the
top
of
the
piles
was
burned
up
and
there
remained
great
glowing
heaps
of
embers
and
logs
of
wood
still
flaming
these
the
boys
began
to
poke
about
with
long
poles
that
jonas
had
cut
for
them
to
make
them
burn
brighter
and
to
see
the
sparks
go
up
presently
they
heard
their
father
calling
them
the
boys
all
stopped
to
listen
are
going
home
said
he
shall
take
cold
if
we
stand
still
here
you
may
stay
however
with
jonas
only
you
must
not
sit
so
father
and
mother
turned
away
and
walked
along
back
towards
the
house
the
light
shining
more
and
more
faintly
upon
them
until
they
were
lost
among
the
trees
do
you
suppose
we
must
not
sit
down
said
lucy
said
jonas
are
afraid
you
will
take
cold
as
long
as
you
run
about
and
play
around
the
fires
you
keep
then
we
will
run
about
and
play
fast
enough
said
james
know
what
i
am
going
to
so
he
took
a
large
flat
piece
of
hemlock
bark
which
he
found
upon
the
ground
and
began
tearing
off
strips
of
birch
bark
from
the
old
tree
and
piling
them
upon
it
are
you
going
to
do
said
lucy
i
am
going
to
play
on
fire
said
he
and
he
took
up
the
piece
of
bark
with
the
little
pile
of
combustibles
upon
it
and
carried
it
down
to
the
edge
of
the
brook
then
he
went
back
and
got
his
torch
stick
and
put
a
fresh
piece
of
birch
bark
in
the
split
end
and
lighted
it
and
then
came
back
to
the
brook
walking
slowly
lest
his
torch
should
go
out
lucy
held
his
torch
for
him
while
he
gently
put
his
on
the
water
and
then
he
lighted
it
with
his
torch
and
pushed
it
out
it
floated
down
all
blazing
as
it
was
to
the
great
delight
of
the
three
children
and
astonishment
of
all
the
little
fishes
in
the
brook
who
could
not
imagine
what
the
blazing
wonder
could
be
the
children
followed
it
along
down
the
brook
and
began
to
pelt
it
with
stones
and
soon
got
into
a
high
frolic
but
as
they
were
very
careful
not
to
hit
one
another
with
the
stones
nor
to
speak
harshly
or
cross
they
enjoyed
it
very
much
when
at
last
the
was
fairly
pelted
to
pieces
and
the
blackened
fragments
of
the
birch
bark
were
scattered
over
the
water
and
floating
away
down
the
stream
they
began
to
think
of
roasting
their
corn
and
potatoes
which
they
did
very
successfully
over
the
remains
of
the
fires
when
they
had
nearly
finished
eating
rollo
suddenly
exclaimed
i
will
tell
you
what
we
will
do
we
will
go
and
set
our
wigwam
on
fire
rollo
pointed
to
the
wigwam
james
and
lucy
looked
and
observed
that
it
had
been
dried
and
browned
in
the
sun
and
rollo
thought
it
was
no
longer
good
for
any
thing
as
a
wigwam
but
would
make
a
capital
bonfire
he
proposed
that
they
should
all
go
into
it
and
sit
down
and
put
a
torch
near
the
side
so
as
to
set
it
on
fire
as
if
accidentally
they
would
go
on
talking
as
if
they
did
not
see
it
and
when
the
flames
burst
out
they
would
jump
up
and
run
out
crying
fire
as
people
do
when
their
houses
get
on
fire
lucy
said
she
should
not
like
to
do
that
she
should
be
afraid
she
said
the
sparks
would
fall
down
upon
her
and
burn
her
so
the
boys
gave
that
plan
up
then
james
proposed
that
they
should
make
believe
that
they
were
savages
going
to
set
fire
to
a
town
the
wigwam
was
to
be
the
town
they
would
take
their
torches
and
all
go
and
set
it
on
fire
in
several
places
then
i
could
not
help
said
lucy
women
do
not
go
to
yes
they
do
if
they
are
savages
said
james
play
that
we
are
savages
you
so
it
was
all
agreed
to
they
lighted
their
torches
and
marched
along
waving
them
in
the
air
until
they
came
to
the
wigwam
and
then
they
danced
around
it
singing
and
shouting
as
they
set
it
on
fire
in
many
places
on
all
sides
the
flames
spread
rapidly
and
flashed
up
high
into
the
air
and
soon
there
was
nothing
left
of
the
poor
wigwam
but
a
few
smoking
and
blackened
sticks
lying
on
the
ground
the
children
then
crept
along
over
the
bridge
and
went
towards
home
there
were
still
great
beds
of
burning
embers
remaining
and
in
some
places
the
remains
of
logs
and
stumps
were
blazing
brightly
and
that
night
when
rollo
went
to
bed
he
lay
looking
out
the
window
which
was
towards
the
woods
and
saw
the
light
still
shining
among
the
trees
and
the
smoke
slowly
rising
from
the
fires
and
floating
away
through
the
air
the
halo
round
the
moon
or
visit
round
about
six
miles
from
the
house
where
rollo
lived
there
was
a
mountain
called
benalgon
which
was
famous
for
bears
and
blueberries
there
were
no
bears
on
it
but
there
were
plenty
of
blueberries
the
reason
why
it
was
so
famous
for
bears
when
in
fact
there
were
none
there
was
because
the
boys
and
girls
that
went
there
for
blueberries
every
year
used
to
see
black
logs
and
stumps
among
the
trees
and
bushes
of
the
mountain
and
they
would
run
away
very
hastily
and
insist
upon
it
when
they
got
down
the
mountain
that
they
had
seen
a
bear
now
father
and
mother
together
with
his
uncle
george
formed
a
plan
for
going
up
this
mountain
after
blueberries
and
they
were
going
to
take
rollo
and
his
cousin
lucy
with
them
uncle
george
and
cousin
lucy
were
to
come
in
a
chaise
to
house
immediately
after
breakfast
and
rollo
was
to
ride
with
them
and
his
father
and
mother
were
to
go
in
another
chaise
rollo
got
his
little
basket
to
pick
his
blueberries
in
all
ready
the
night
before
and
he
got
a
string
to
tie
around
his
neck
intending
to
hang
his
basket
upon
it
so
that
he
could
have
both
his
hands
at
liberty
and
pick
faster
he
also
thought
he
would
take
all
the
heavy
things
out
of
his
pocket
so
that
he
could
run
the
faster
in
case
he
should
see
any
bears
he
put
them
all
on
a
window
in
the
shed
the
things
were
a
knife
a
piece
of
chalk
two
white
pebble
stones
and
a
plummet
when
he
got
them
all
out
he
asked
jonas
who
was
splitting
wood
in
the
shed
if
he
would
not
take
care
of
them
for
him
till
he
came
back
yes
said
jonas
will
take
care
of
them
if
you
wish
but
what
are
you
going
to
leave
them
for
so
that
i
can
run
faster
said
rollo
faster
i
do
not
think
you
will
run
much
up
old
benalgon
unless
he
holds
his
back
down
lower
than
when
i
went
rollo
did
not
mean
that
he
was
going
to
run
up
the
mountain
but
he
did
not
explain
what
he
did
mean
for
he
thought
that
jonas
would
laugh
at
him
if
he
told
him
he
was
afraid
of
the
bears
so
he
said
you
wish
you
were
going
with
us
should
like
it
well
enough
but
i
must
stay
at
home
and
mind
my
wish
you
could
go
i
will
go
and
ask
my
father
if
he
will
not
let
rollo
ran
into
the
house
with
great
haste
and
eagerness
leaving
all
the
doors
open
and
calling
out
father
as
soon
as
he
had
begun
to
open
the
parlor
door
father
said
he
running
up
to
him
wish
you
would
let
jonas
go
with
us
now
father
had
come
home
but
a
short
time
before
and
was
just
seated
quietly
in
his
reading
a
newspaper
and
rollo
came
up
to
him
pulling
down
the
paper
with
his
hands
and
looking
up
into
his
face
so
as
to
stop
his
reading
at
once
heedless
boys
very
often
come
to
ask
favors
in
this
way
his
father
gently
moved
him
back
and
said
my
son
it
is
not
convenient
for
jonas
to
go
besides
i
am
busy
now
and
can
not
talk
with
you
must
go
rollo
turned
away
disappointed
and
went
slowly
back
through
the
kitchen
his
mother
who
was
there
and
who
heard
all
that
passed
as
the
doors
were
open
said
to
him
as
he
walked
by
her
a
foolish
way
that
was
to
ask
him
rollo
you
might
have
known
it
would
have
done
no
rollo
did
not
answer
but
he
went
and
sat
down
on
the
step
of
the
door
and
was
just
beginning
to
think
what
the
foolishness
was
in
his
way
of
asking
his
father
when
a
little
bird
came
hopping
along
in
the
yard
he
ran
in
to
ask
his
mother
to
give
him
some
milk
to
feed
the
bird
with
she
smiled
and
told
him
milk
was
good
for
kittens
but
not
for
birds
and
she
gave
him
some
crumbs
of
bread
rollo
threw
the
crumbs
out
but
they
only
frightened
the
little
thing
away
that
night
when
rollo
went
to
bed
his
father
said
that
when
he
was
all
ready
he
would
come
up
and
see
him
when
he
came
into
his
chamber
rollo
called
out
to
him
father
look
out
the
window
and
see
what
a
beautiful
ring
there
is
round
the
there
is
said
his
father
am
rather
sorry
to
see
father
why
it
is
beautiful
i
does
look
pretty
but
it
is
a
sign
of
rain
rain
o
no
father
it
is
a
kind
of
a
rainbow
it
is
a
round
rainbow
i
am
sure
it
will
be
pleasant
well
said
his
father
shall
see
in
the
then
he
sat
down
on
some
time
talking
with
him
on
various
subjects
and
then
heard
him
say
his
prayers
at
length
he
took
the
light
and
bade
rollo
good
night
eye
caught
another
view
of
the
moon
as
his
father
was
going
and
he
said
father
just
look
at
the
moon
once
more
that
a
rainbow
i
see
the
colors
i
expect
it
will
grow
into
a
large
one
such
as
you
told
me
was
a
sign
of
fair
weather
i
will
watch
said
his
father
can
watch
it
as
you
go
to
so
rollo
laid
his
face
upon
his
pillow
in
such
a
way
that
he
could
see
the
moon
through
the
window
and
he
began
to
watch
the
bright
circle
around
it
but
before
it
grew
any
bigger
he
was
fast
asleep
who
knows
best
a
little
boy
or
his
father
the
next
morning
rollo
awoke
early
and
he
was
very
much
pleased
to
see
as
soon
as
he
opened
his
eyes
that
the
sun
was
shining
in
at
the
windows
he
was
not
only
pleased
to
find
that
the
prospect
was
so
good
for
a
pleasant
ride
but
his
vanity
was
gratified
at
the
thought
that
it
had
turned
out
that
he
knew
better
about
the
weather
than
his
father
he
began
to
dress
himself
as
far
as
he
could
without
help
and
was
preparing
to
hasten
down
to
his
father
to
tell
him
that
it
was
going
to
be
a
pleasant
day
when
he
was
nearly
dressed
he
was
surprised
lo
observe
that
the
bright
sunlight
on
the
wall
was
gradually
fading
away
and
at
length
it
wholly
disappeared
he
went
to
look
out
the
window
to
see
what
was
the
cause
he
found
that
there
was
a
broad
expanse
of
dark
cloud
covering
the
eastern
sky
excepting
a
narrow
strip
quite
low
down
near
the
horizon
when
the
sun
first
rose
it
shone
brightly
through
this
narrow
zone
of
clear
sky
but
now
it
had
ascended
a
little
higher
and
gone
behind
the
cloud
mind
said
rollo
to
himself
cloud
is
not
so
very
large
after
all
and
the
sun
will
come
out
again
above
it
when
it
gets
up
a
little
rollo
came
down
to
breakfast
and
he
went
out
into
the
yard
every
two
or
three
minutes
to
look
at
the
sky
the
cloud
seemed
to
extend
so
that
the
sun
did
not
come
out
of
it
as
he
expected
but
still
he
thought
it
was
going
to
be
pleasant
children
generally
think
it
is
going
to
be
pleasant
whenever
they
want
to
go
away
his
father
thought
it
was
probably
going
to
rain
and
that
at
any
rate
it
was
very
doubtful
whether
uncle
george
would
come
however
he
said
they
should
soon
see
and
true
enough
just
as
they
were
rising
from
the
breakfast
table
a
chaise
drove
up
to
the
door
and
out
jumped
uncle
george
and
cousin
lucy
lucy
was
a
very
pleasant
little
girl
two
or
three
years
older
than
rollo
she
had
a
small
tin
pail
in
her
hand
with
a
cover
upon
it
morning
rollo
said
she
you
got
your
basket
ready
said
rollo
i
am
afraid
it
is
going
to
while
the
children
were
saying
this
uncle
george
said
to
father
suppose
we
shall
have
to
give
up
our
expedition
i
am
in
hopes
we
are
going
to
have
some
thought
rollo
is
very
strange
when
we
want
to
go
a
father
and
mother
and
his
uncle
looked
at
the
clouds
all
around
they
concluded
that
there
was
every
appearance
of
rain
and
that
it
would
be
best
to
postpone
their
excursion
and
then
went
into
the
house
rollo
was
very
confident
it
would
not
rain
and
was
very
eager
to
have
them
go
he
asked
lucy
if
she
did
not
think
it
was
going
to
be
pleasant
but
lucy
was
more
modest
and
reasonable
than
he
was
and
said
that
she
did
not
know
she
could
not
judge
of
the
weather
so
well
as
her
father
rollo
began
by
this
time
to
be
considerably
out
of
humor
he
said
he
knew
it
was
not
going
to
rain
and
he
did
not
see
why
they
might
not
go
he
did
not
believe
it
would
rain
a
drop
all
day
lucy
just
then
pointed
down
to
a
little
dark
spot
on
the
stone
step
of
the
door
where
a
drop
had
just
fallen
and
asked
rollo
what
he
called
that
that
that
that
said
she
pointing
to
several
other
drops
rollo
at
first
insisted
that
that
was
not
rain
but
some
little
spots
on
the
stone
then
lucy
reached
out
her
hand
and
said
out
your
hand
so
rollo
and
you
will
feel
the
drops
coming
down
out
of
the
rollo
held
out
his
hand
a
moment
but
then
immediately
withdrew
it
saying
impatiently
that
he
did
not
care
it
was
not
rain
at
any
rate
it
was
only
a
little
sprinkling
lucy
observed
that
rollo
was
getting
very
much
out
of
humor
and
she
tried
to
please
him
by
saying
i
would
not
mind
if
it
does
rain
i
will
ask
my
father
to
let
me
stay
and
play
with
you
and
we
can
have
a
fine
time
up
in
your
little
we
can
not
said
rollo
besides
they
will
not
let
you
stay
i
know
i
went
yesterday
to
ask
my
father
to
let
jonas
go
with
us
and
he
would
it
was
certainly
very
unreasonable
for
rollo
to
imagine
that
his
father
and
uncle
would
be
unwilling
to
have
lucy
stay
just
because
it
had
not
been
convenient
to
let
jonas
go
with
them
but
when
children
are
out
of
humor
they
are
always
very
unreasonable
would
not
he
let
jonas
go
asked
lucy
do
not
know
mother
said
it
was
because
i
did
not
ask
him
did
you
ask
him
i
interrupted
him
he
was
that
is
not
the
way
i
never
my
father
if
i
want
to
ask
him
any
he
is
busy
and
you
want
to
know
that
very
minute
what
do
you
do
will
show
you
come
with
me
and
i
will
ask
him
to
let
me
stay
with
you
so
lucy
and
rollo
walked
in
when
they
came
to
the
parlor
door
they
saw
that
their
parents
were
sitting
on
the
sofa
talking
about
other
things
rollo
stopped
at
the
door
but
lucy
went
in
gently
she
walked
up
to
her
side
and
stood
there
still
her
father
took
no
notice
of
her
at
first
but
went
on
talking
with
father
lucy
stood
very
patiently
until
after
a
few
minutes
her
father
stopped
talking
and
said
my
dear
do
you
want
to
speak
to
me
sir
said
lucy
wanted
to
ask
you
if
you
were
willing
to
let
me
stay
here
and
play
with
rollo
if
you
do
not
go
to
the
do
not
know
said
her
father
hesitating
and
patting
lucy
on
the
is
a
new
idea
however
i
believe
i
have
no
lucy
ran
back
joyfully
to
rollo
and
after
a
short
time
her
father
went
home
rollo
however
did
not
feel
in
any
better
humor
and
all
endeavors
to
engage
him
in
some
amusement
failed
she
proposed
building
with
bricks
or
going
up
into
his
little
room
and
drawing
pictures
on
their
slates
or
getting
his
storybooks
out
and
reading
stories
and
various
other
things
but
rollo
would
not
be
pleased
rollo
ought
now
when
he
found
that
he
must
be
disappointed
about
his
ride
to
have
immediately
banished
it
from
his
mind
altogether
and
turned
his
thoughts
to
other
pleasures
but
like
all
people
he
keep
thinking
and
talking
all
the
time
about
the
thing
which
caused
his
so
he
sat
in
a
large
back
entry
where
he
and
lucy
were
looking
out
at
the
door
and
saying
a
great
many
things
about
the
weather
and
his
giving
up
the
ride
just
for
a
little
sprinkling
of
rain
that
would
not
last
half
an
hour
he
said
it
was
a
shame
too
for
it
to
rain
that
day
just
because
he
was
going
to
ride
just
then
his
father
spoke
to
him
from
the
window
and
called
him
in
he
and
lucy
went
in
together
into
the
parlor
said
his
father
you
know
you
were
doing
very
wrong
rollo
felt
a
little
guilty
but
he
said
rather
faintly
sir
i
was
not
doing
any
are
committing
a
great
many
sins
all
at
rollo
was
silent
he
knew
his
father
meant
sins
of
the
heart
heart
is
in
a
very
wicked
state
you
are
under
the
dominion
of
some
of
the
worst
of
feelings
you
are
ungrateful
undutiful
unjust
selfish
and
he
added
in
a
lower
and
more
solemn
tone
rollo
thought
that
these
were
heavy
charges
to
bring
upon
him
but
his
father
spoke
calmly
and
kindly
and
he
knew
that
he
could
easily
show
that
what
he
said
was
true
are
imagining
that
you
a
little
boy
of
seven
years
old
can
judge
better
than
your
father
and
mother
and
obstinately
persisting
in
your
opinion
that
it
is
not
going
to
rain
when
the
rain
has
actually
commenced
and
is
falling
faster
and
faster
you
are
to
speak
reproachfully
of
me
and
give
me
pain
by
your
when
i
have
been
planning
this
excursion
in
a
great
degree
for
your
enjoyment
and
only
give
it
up
because
i
am
absolutely
compelled
to
do
it
by
a
storm
in
showing
such
a
repining
unsubmissive
spirit
towards
your
father
in
making
lucy
and
all
of
us
suffer
because
you
are
unwilling
to
submit
to
these
circumstances
that
we
can
not
control
in
being
unwilling
that
it
should
rain
and
interfere
with
your
ride
when
you
know
that
rain
is
so
much
wanted
in
all
the
fields
all
over
the
country
and
what
is
worse
than
all
in
openly
rebelling
against
god
and
censuring
the
arrangements
of
his
providence
and
pretending
to
think
that
they
are
made
just
to
trouble
when
he
had
said
this
he
paused
to
hear
what
rollo
would
say
he
thought
that
if
he
was
convinced
of
his
sin
and
really
penitent
he
would
acknowledge
that
he
was
wrong
or
at
least
be
silent
that
if
on
the
other
hand
he
were
still
unsubdued
he
would
go
to
making
excuses
after
a
pause
rollo
said
did
not
know
that
there
was
need
of
rain
in
the
not
you
said
his
father
not
you
know
that
the
ground
was
very
dry
and
that
unless
we
have
rain
soon
the
crops
will
suffer
very
much
sir
said
rollo
is
so
said
his
father
this
rain
which
you
are
so
unwilling
to
have
descend
is
going
down
into
the
ground
all
over
the
country
and
into
the
roots
of
all
the
plants
growing
in
the
fields
carrying
in
the
nourishment
which
will
swell
out
all
the
corn
and
grain
and
apples
and
pears
in
a
few
days
there
will
be
thousands
and
thousands
of
worth
of
fruit
and
food
more
than
there
would
have
been
without
this
rain
and
yet
you
are
very
unwilling
to
have
it
come
because
you
want
to
go
and
get
a
few
blueberries
rollo
was
confounded
and
had
not
a
word
to
say
rollo
continued
his
father
the
rest
of
us
are
disposed
to
be
and
to
acquiesce
in
decision
and
try
to
have
a
happy
day
at
home
and
we
can
not
have
it
spoiled
by
your
wicked
repinings
so
you
must
go
away
by
yourself
until
you
feel
willing
to
submit
pleasantly
and
with
good
humor
then
you
may
come
back
but
be
sure
not
to
come
back
repentance
now
there
was
in
house
a
small
back
garret
over
a
part
of
the
kitchen
chamber
which
had
one
small
window
in
it
looking
out
into
the
garden
this
garret
was
not
used
and
father
had
put
a
little
there
and
a
small
table
with
a
bible
on
it
and
hung
some
old
maps
about
it
so
as
to
make
it
as
pleasant
a
little
place
as
he
could
and
there
he
used
to
send
rollo
when
he
had
done
any
thing
very
wrong
or
when
he
was
sullen
and
ill
natured
that
he
might
reflect
in
solitude
and
either
return
a
good
boy
or
else
stay
where
his
bad
feelings
would
not
trouble
or
injure
others
his
father
had
put
in
marks
too
at
several
places
in
the
bible
where
he
thought
it
would
be
well
for
him
to
read
at
such
times
as
he
said
that
reading
suitable
passages
in
the
bible
would
be
more
likely
to
bring
him
to
repentance
than
any
other
book
rollo
knew
that
when
his
father
told
him
to
go
away
by
himself
he
meant
for
him
to
go
into
this
back
garret
so
he
turned
round
and
walked
out
of
the
room
as
he
passed
up
the
back
stairs
the
kitten
came
frisking
around
him
but
he
had
no
heart
to
play
with
her
and
walked
on
he
then
turned
and
went
up
the
narrow
steep
stairs
that
led
to
the
garret
they
were
rather
more
like
a
ladder
than
like
stairs
rollo
ascended
them
and
then
sat
down
in
the
little
the
rain
was
beating
against
the
windows
and
pattering
on
the
roof
which
was
just
over
his
head
it
is
sometimes
but
a
little
thing
which
turns
the
whole
current
of
the
thoughts
and
feelings
in
case
at
this
time
it
was
but
a
drop
of
water
for
after
having
sat
some
time
in
his
chair
his
heart
remaining
pretty
nearly
the
same
a
drop
of
water
which
somehow
or
other
contrived
to
get
through
some
crevice
in
the
boards
and
shingles
over
his
head
fell
exactly
into
the
back
of
his
neck
the
first
feeling
it
occasioned
was
an
additional
emotion
of
impatience
and
fretfulness
but
he
next
began
to
think
how
unreasonable
and
wicked
it
was
to
make
all
that
difficulty
just
because
his
father
was
preventing
his
going
out
to
stay
all
day
in
the
rain
when
a
single
drop
falling
upon
him
vexed
and
irritated
him
illustration
he
also
looked
out
of
the
window
towards
the
garden
and
the
dry
ground
and
all
the
trees
and
garden
vegetables
seemed
to
be
drinking
in
the
rain
with
delight
that
made
him
think
of
the
vast
amount
of
good
the
rain
was
doing
and
he
saw
his
own
selfishness
in
a
striking
point
of
view
in
a
word
rollo
was
now
beginning
to
be
really
penitent
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
but
they
were
tears
of
real
sorrow
for
sin
not
of
vexation
and
anger
he
took
up
his
little
bible
to
read
one
of
the
passages
as
his
father
had
advised
him
he
happened
to
open
at
a
mark
which
his
father
had
put
in
at
the
parable
of
the
prodigal
son
the
first
verse
which
his
eye
fell
upon
was
the
verse
will
arise
and
go
to
my
rollo
thought
that
that
was
exactly
the
thing
for
him
to
go
and
confess
his
fault
to
his
father
so
he
laid
down
his
little
bible
wiped
the
tears
from
his
eyes
and
went
down
stairs
he
met
his
father
in
the
entry
he
went
up
to
him
and
took
his
hand
and
said
i
am
really
very
sorry
i
have
been
so
naughty
i
to
be
a
good
boy
his
father
stooped
down
and
kissed
him
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
rollo
said
he
you
may
go
and
find
lucy
i
believe
she
is
up
in
your
rollo
went
off
quite
happy
in
pursuit
of
lucy
he
found
her
sitting
on
a
cricket
in
his
room
looking
over
a
little
rollo
ran
laughing
up
to
her
and
said
have
you
got
lucy
of
your
little
will
you
lend
it
to
me
to
carry
home
rollo
said
he
would
and
then
they
began
to
talk
about
what
they
should
do
it
rained
very
fast
and
they
could
not
go
out
of
doors
and
after
proposing
several
things
which
however
neither
of
them
seemed
to
like
they
turned
to
mother
and
asked
her
what
they
had
better
do
always
find
said
his
mother
when
i
am
disappointed
of
any
pleasure
it
is
best
not
to
try
to
find
any
other
pleasure
in
its
place
but
to
turn
to
the
children
did
not
understand
this
very
well
and
they
were
silent
i
mean
she
continued
this
when
we
have
just
been
disappointed
of
any
pleasure
which
we
had
set
our
hearts
upon
it
is
very
difficult
to
find
any
thing
else
that
we
can
have
in
its
place
that
will
look
as
pleasant
as
the
one
we
had
lost
you
see
that
you
are
not
satisfied
with
any
thing
you
propose
to
one
another
now
i
find
that
the
best
way
in
such
cases
is
to
give
up
pleasure
altogether
and
turn
to
some
duty
and
after
performing
the
duty
a
short
time
peace
and
satisfaction
return
to
the
mind
again
and
we
get
over
the
effects
of
the
disappointment
in
the
quickest
and
pleasantest
rollo
and
lucy
looked
at
one
another
rather
soberly
they
did
not
seem
to
know
what
to
say
presume
however
you
will
not
do
this
continued
his
mother
said
rollo
said
his
mother
requires
a
good
deal
of
resolution
at
first
to
turn
to
when
you
have
just
been
setting
your
heart
on
we
have
got
resolution
enough
said
rollo
duty
do
you
think
we
had
better
do
asked
lucy
i
were
you
replied
mother
should
first
of
all
sit
down
and
have
a
good
reading
rollo
and
lucy
hesitated
a
little
but
they
concluded
to
take
their
advice
at
last
and
went
to
little
library
and
chose
a
book
and
then
went
down
to
the
back
entry
and
sat
down
there
on
a
long
cricket
and
began
to
read
at
first
it
was
rather
hard
to
do
it
for
it
did
not
look
very
pleasant
to
either
of
them
to
sit
down
and
read
just
at
the
time
when
they
expected
to
be
gathering
blueberries
on
the
mountain
rollo
said
when
they
were
opening
the
hook
and
finding
the
place
that
if
they
had
gone
they
should
by
that
time
have
just
about
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
said
lucy
we
must
not
think
of
that
now
besides
just
see
how
it
rains
it
would
be
a
fine
time
now
to
go
up
a
mountain
it
rollo
looked
out
of
the
open
door
and
saw
the
rain
pouring
down
into
the
yard
and
felt
again
ashamed
to
recollect
how
he
had
insisted
that
it
was
not
going
to
rain
lucy
said
it
was
beautiful
to
see
it
pouring
down
so
fast
said
she
it
streams
down
from
the
spout
at
the
corner
of
the
barn
said
rollo
see
that
little
pond
out
by
the
garden
gate
how
it
is
all
full
of
little
bubbles
it
will
be
a
beautiful
pond
for
me
to
sail
boats
in
when
the
rain
is
over
i
can
make
and
pea
boats
boats
said
lucy
are
they
are
beautiful
little
boats
said
he
showed
me
how
to
make
them
we
take
a
a
good
large
full
and
shave
off
the
top
from
one
end
to
the
other
and
then
take
out
the
peas
and
it
makes
a
beautiful
little
boat
i
wish
we
had
some
i
could
show
us
make
some
when
we
have
done
reading
and
sail
them
only
that
pond
will
all
go
away
when
the
rain
is
no
said
rollo
will
put
some
ground
all
around
it
and
then
the
water
can
not
run
but
it
will
soak
down
into
the
it
said
rollo
we
can
sail
our
boats
on
it
a
little
while
before
it
is
it
is
so
wet
said
lucy
can
not
go
out
to
get
any
did
not
think
of
that
said
rollo
jonas
could
get
some
for
us
with
an
could
go
with
an
umbrella
said
lucy
as
well
as
the
children
saw
an
umbrella
behind
the
door
and
they
thought
they
would
go
both
together
and
they
actually
laid
down
their
book
spread
the
umbrella
and
went
to
the
door
it
then
occurred
to
them
that
it
would
not
be
quite
right
to
go
out
without
leave
so
rollo
went
to
ask
his
mother
his
mother
said
it
was
not
suitable
for
young
ladies
to
go
out
in
the
rain
as
their
shoes
and
their
dress
generally
were
thin
and
could
not
bear
to
be
exposed
to
wet
but
she
said
that
rollo
himself
might
take
off
his
shoes
and
stockings
and
go
out
alone
when
the
rain
held
up
mother
said
he
can
not
i
go
out
now
with
the
umbrella
she
replied
it
rains
fast
some
of
the
water
spatters
through
the
umbrella
and
some
will
be
driven
against
you
by
the
i
will
wait
and
as
soon
as
it
rains
but
little
i
will
go
out
but
must
i
take
off
my
shoes
and
stockings
said
his
mother
else
you
will
get
them
wet
and
muddy
and
before
you
go
you
must
get
a
dipper
of
water
ready
in
the
shed
to
pour
on
your
feet
and
wash
them
when
you
get
back
and
then
wait
till
they
are
entirely
dry
before
you
put
on
your
shoes
and
stockings
again
if
you
want
the
enough
to
take
all
that
trouble
you
may
go
for
rollo
said
he
did
want
them
enough
for
that
and
he
then
went
back
and
told
lucy
what
his
mother
had
said
and
they
concluded
to
read
until
the
rain
should
cease
and
that
then
rollo
should
go
out
into
the
garden
they
began
to
read
but
their
minds
were
so
much
upon
the
boats
that
the
story
did
not
interest
them
very
much
besides
children
can
not
read
very
well
aloud
to
one
another
for
if
they
succeed
in
calling
all
the
words
right
they
do
not
generally
give
the
stops
and
the
emphasis
and
the
proper
tones
of
voice
so
as
to
make
the
story
interesting
to
those
that
hear
some
boys
and
girls
are
vain
enough
to
think
that
they
can
read
very
well
just
because
they
can
call
all
the
words
without
stopping
to
spell
them
but
this
is
very
far
from
being
enough
to
make
a
good
reader
rollo
read
a
little
way
and
then
lucy
read
a
little
way
but
they
were
not
much
interested
and
thinking
that
the
difficulty
might
be
in
the
book
they
got
another
but
with
no
better
success
at
last
rollo
said
they
would
go
and
get
their
mother
to
read
to
them
so
they
went
together
to
her
room
and
rollo
said
that
they
could
not
get
along
very
well
in
rending
themselves
and
asked
her
if
she
would
not
be
good
enough
to
read
to
them
what
is
the
difficulty
said
she
i
do
not
know
exactly
the
story
is
not
very
interesting
and
then
we
can
not
read
very
what
respect
will
it
be
better
for
me
to
read
to
you
she
asked
mother
you
can
choose
us
a
prettier
story
and
then
we
should
understand
it
better
if
you
read
suppose
you
would
but
i
see
you
have
made
a
great
mistake
said
both
the
children
at
once
is
it
that
you
are
going
to
read
at
all
you
advised
us
to
i
advise
you
to
do
it
as
a
or
as
a
a
mother
i
recollect
said
rollo
well
now
the
mistake
you
have
made
is
that
you
are
looking
upon
it
only
as
a
pleasure
and
instead
of
doing
it
faithfully
in
such
a
way
as
will
make
it
most
useful
to
you
you
are
forgetting
that
altogether
and
only
intent
upon
having
it
interesting
and
pleasant
is
it
not
so
said
rollo
hesitating
and
looking
down
and
then
turning
round
to
lucy
he
said
suppose
we
had
better
go
and
read
the
story
just
as
you
please
said
his
mother
have
not
commanded
you
to
read
but
only
recommended
it
and
that
not
as
a
way
of
you
but
as
a
way
of
spending
an
hour
as
a
preparation
for
an
hour
of
enjoyment
afterwards
you
can
do
as
you
please
however
but
if
you
attempt
to
read
at
all
i
advise
you
to
do
it
not
as
but
as
a
come
rollo
said
lucy
us
so
the
children
ran
back
to
the
entry
and
sat
down
to
their
story
taking
pains
to
read
carefully
as
if
their
object
was
to
learn
to
read
and
though
they
did
not
expect
it
they
did
in
fact
have
a
very
pleasant
time
the
rest
of
the
adventures
of
rollo
and
lucy
during
this
day
must
be
reserved
for
another
story
the
freshet
the
story
that
rollo
and
his
cousin
lucy
began
to
read
together
in
the
back
entry
looking
out
towards
the
garden
that
rainy
day
when
they
were
disappointed
of
the
excursion
up
the
mountain
commenced
as
follows
maria
and
the
caravan
maria
wilton
lives
in
the
pretty
white
house
which
stands
just
at
the
entrance
of
the
wood
where
the
children
find
the
blackberries
so
thick
in
the
berrying
season
it
is
not
as
large
or
elegant
a
house
as
many
that
we
pass
on
a
walk
through
the
village
but
yet
with
its
front
and
blooming
little
garden
its
appearance
is
quite
as
inviting
as
that
of
many
a
more
splendid
mansion
certain
it
is
at
least
that
there
is
not
a
more
pleasant
or
happy
dwelling
in
the
town
neatness
and
good
order
regulate
all
the
arrangements
of
the
family
and
where
such
is
the
case
it
is
almost
needless
to
add
that
peace
and
harmony
characterize
the
intercourse
of
the
inmates
it
is
seldom
that
confusion
or
uproar
or
disputes
or
contentions
are
known
among
the
wiltons
but
it
was
of
maria
that
i
was
intending
to
speak
more
particularly
kind
and
yielding
and
conciliating
manners
towards
her
brothers
and
sisters
maria
was
not
the
oldest
of
the
children
she
was
not
quite
nine
and
her
sister
harriet
was
as
much
as
eleven
and
her
brother
george
still
older
and
yet
her
influence
did
more
to
maintain
peace
and
good
feeling
in
the
family
group
than
would
have
been
believed
by
a
person
who
had
not
observed
her
in
every
case
where
only
her
own
wishes
or
inclinations
were
concerned
maria
was
ready
to
give
up
to
george
or
harriet
because
as
she
said
they
were
older
than
herself
and
again
she
was
quite
as
ready
to
yield
to
little
susan
and
willy
because
they
were
younger
her
brothers
and
sisters
in
their
turn
were
far
less
apt
to
contend
for
any
privilege
or
advantage
than
they
would
have
been
if
she
had
shown
herself
more
tenacious
of
her
own
rights
wilton
used
occasionally
to
go
into
the
city
a
few
miles
distant
upon
business
he
usually
went
in
a
chaise
taking
one
of
the
children
with
him
the
excursion
was
to
them
a
very
pleasant
one
and
all
anticipated
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
their
respective
turns
to
ride
with
their
father
it
happened
that
the
day
when
it
fell
to
turn
was
to
be
the
close
of
an
exhibition
of
animals
which
had
been
for
a
short
time
in
the
city
eye
brightened
with
pleasure
as
her
father
mentioned
this
circumstance
at
the
dinner
table
and
inquired
if
she
would
like
to
visit
the
caravan
father
exclaimed
george
eagerly
as
he
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
caravan
i
go
can
not
both
go
replied
his
father
i
believe
it
is
turn
to
go
into
town
with
said
george
i
believe
maria
would
care
any
thing
about
seeing
it
and
his
eye
glanced
eagerly
from
his
father
to
maria
and
then
from
maria
to
his
father
again
is
it
maria
said
wilton
you
no
wish
to
visit
the
caravan
maria
did
not
answer
directly
while
yet
her
countenance
showed
very
plainly
what
her
wishes
really
were
there
an
there
father
she
at
length
rather
hesitatingly
inquired
probably
is
replied
her
father
repeated
george
with
something
of
a
sneer
has
not
seen
an
elephant
i
would
not
give
a
farthing
to
go
if
there
was
nothing
better
than
an
elephant
to
be
you
care
so
much
to
see
inquired
wilton
i
would
give
any
thing
to
see
a
leopard
or
a
leopard
or
a
camel
repeated
his
father
in
the
same
tone
in
which
george
had
made
his
rude
speech
am
sure
i
give
a
farthing
to
see
either
a
camel
or
a
said
george
you
have
seen
them
both
but
never
has
maria
seen
an
elephant
returned
wilton
what
is
the
difference
george
looked
a
little
mortified
at
the
overthrow
of
his
argument
but
still
his
eagerness
for
the
gratification
was
not
to
be
think
a
need
to
care
about
going
to
see
a
parcel
of
wild
beasts
he
remarked
rather
petulantly
as
he
gave
his
chair
a
push
upon
rising
from
the
table
george
expostulated
his
father
did
not
think
you
were
either
a
selfish
or
a
sullen
father
and
he
is
not
said
maria
approaching
her
father
and
taking
his
hand
he
wants
to
go
very
much
and
i
do
not
care
so
about
it
so
he
may
go
and
i
will
stay
at
are
a
good
girl
said
her
father
i
shall
not
consent
to
any
such
injustice
so
go
and
get
ready
as
quick
as
father
i
had
really
a
great
deal
rather
that
george
should
go
insisted
maria
i
can
not
think
that
george
would
really
on
the
whole
prefer
to
take
your
place
said
wilton
turning
to
george
replied
george
by
this
time
to
a
sense
of
propriety
and
standing
ready
to
speak
for
himself
sir
maria
is
very
kind
but
i
do
not
wish
to
take
her
place
i
am
very
sorry
indeed
that
i
said
any
thing
about
it
i
certainly
shall
not
consent
to
hike
your
place
maria
he
said
perceiving
that
she
was
ready
to
entreat
still
further
but
i
do
wish
you
would
said
maria
but
just
here
her
mother
interposed
maria
would
really
prefer
to
give
up
her
place
to
her
brother
said
wilton
certainly
shall
like
the
arrangement
very
much
for
i
am
to
be
particularly
engaged
this
afternoon
and
as
harriet
is
to
be
absent
i
shall
be
very
glad
of
some
of
assistance
in
taking
care
of
the
well
said
maria
brightening
up
i
am
sure
i
will
not
go
so
run
george
for
father
is
almost
ready
to
thus
the
matter
was
amicably
settled
george
went
with
his
father
and
maria
remained
at
home
to
help
take
care
of
little
willy
maria
loved
her
little
brother
very
much
and
she
never
seemed
tired
of
taking
care
of
him
even
when
he
was
ever
so
fretful
or
restless
she
would
leave
her
play
at
any
moment
to
run
and
rock
the
baby
or
to
hold
him
in
her
lap
for
even
if
she
felt
inclined
at
any
time
to
be
a
little
out
of
patience
for
a
moment
she
would
recollect
how
many
hours
she
had
herself
been
nursed
by
night
and
by
day
and
she
was
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
relieve
her
mother
of
some
of
her
care
and
fatigue
her
cousin
ellen
weston
called
one
afternoon
to
ask
her
to
accompany
a
party
of
little
girls
who
were
going
to
gather
berries
in
the
wood
near
house
it
happened
that
maria
had
been
left
with
the
care
of
willy
just
as
her
cousin
called
and
it
happened
too
that
willy
was
that
afternoon
unusually
fretful
and
difficult
to
please
if
maria
left
him
for
a
moment
or
if
she
did
not
hold
him
exactly
in
the
posture
which
suited
him
or
if
she
had
not
precisely
the
thing
ready
which
he
wanted
at
the
moment
he
would
act
just
as
all
babies
of
nine
or
ten
months
sometimes
take
it
into
their
heads
to
act
with
all
her
patience
and
she
hardly
knew
how
to
manage
him
and
especially
after
having
been
obliged
to
reject
so
agreeable
an
invitation
as
the
one
her
cousin
brought
she
found
her
task
a
little
irksome
she
could
hardly
repress
an
occasional
expression
of
impatience
as
she
tried
in
vain
to
please
the
wayward
little
fellow
but
her
patience
and
were
very
soon
restored
and
as
she
reflected
that
she
was
doing
her
mother
a
great
deal
of
good
by
staying
at
home
with
willy
she
felt
quite
willing
to
dismiss
all
thoughts
of
the
berrying
expedition
the
girls
however
did
not
forget
her
it
was
proposed
by
one
of
the
party
when
ellen
had
stated
the
reason
why
maria
could
not
join
them
that
each
should
contribute
some
portion
of
her
berries
to
be
carried
to
her
on
their
way
home
all
agreed
very
readily
to
the
plan
and
each
took
pains
to
select
the
largest
and
the
ripest
of
her
berries
for
basket
the
gratification
afforded
maria
by
this
little
token
of
kind
remembrance
more
than
compensated
for
the
which
she
had
practised
it
is
almost
always
the
case
when
persons
cheerfully
submit
to
any
privation
for
the
sake
of
other
persons
or
because
it
is
duty
that
they
are
amply
rewarded
for
it
they
enjoy
at
least
the
consciousness
of
doing
right
which
is
one
of
the
very
highest
sources
of
pleasure
maria
would
at
any
time
have
been
satisfied
with
only
this
reward
but
it
very
often
happened
very
unexpectedly
that
something
more
was
in
store
for
her
this
was
the
case
upon
the
time
when
she
gave
up
her
ride
and
her
visit
to
the
caravan
for
the
sake
of
her
brother
i
have
not
said
that
it
was
absolutely
duty
to
yield
to
her
brother
in
this
case
perhaps
it
would
have
been
perfectly
right
for
her
to
have
maintained
her
own
claims
and
yet
there
is
no
doubt
that
she
felt
a
great
deal
happier
for
the
sacrifice
she
had
made
but
we
were
going
to
speak
of
some
further
reward
that
her
amiable
behavior
in
this
instance
procured
her
as
her
father
opened
a
package
which
he
had
brought
on
his
return
he
silently
placed
in
her
hands
a
beautiful
copy
of
a
work
upon
the
of
which
she
found
reward
for
her
kind
and
obliging
manners
towards
her
brothers
and
small
craft
when
they
had
finished
the
story
lucy
shut
the
book
saying
was
a
good
girl
was
not
she
rollo
said
rollo
was
an
excellent
girl
i
would
have
done
just
so
would
not
you
lucy
ought
to
i
know
said
lucy
perhaps
i
should
should
i
am
sure
said
rollo
lucy
was
a
polite
girl
and
she
did
not
contradict
rollo
though
she
recollected
how
much
selfishness
he
had
shown
that
morning
and
it
did
not
seem
to
her
very
likely
that
he
would
have
been
willing
to
make
any
very
great
sacrifice
to
oblige
others
father
says
we
can
not
tell
what
we
should
do
until
we
are
tried
said
lucy
i
i
should
have
been
willing
to
stay
at
home
if
i
had
been
maria
replied
rollo
only
think
that
would
be
preferring
another
pleasure
rather
than
your
i
prefer
another
pleasure
rather
than
my
rollo
was
beginning
to
get
a
little
excited
and
vexed
people
who
boast
of
excellences
which
they
do
not
possess
are
very
apt
to
be
unreasonable
and
angry
when
any
body
seems
to
doubt
whether
their
boastings
are
true
he
was
thus
going
on
insisting
upon
it
that
he
should
have
acted
as
maria
had
done
and
was
just
saying
that
he
should
prefer
another
pleasure
rather
than
his
own
when
jonas
came
into
the
entry
from
the
kitchen
with
an
armful
of
wood
which
he
was
carrying
into
the
parlor
is
it
rollo
said
jonas
you
prefer
another
pleasure
to
your
own
said
rollo
with
an
air
of
and
consequence
jonas
smiled
and
went
on
with
his
wood
it
is
always
better
for
boys
to
be
modest
and
they
appear
ridiculous
to
others
when
they
are
boasting
what
things
they
can
do
and
when
they
boast
what
things
they
do
they
are
very
likely
to
be
just
on
the
eve
of
doing
exactly
the
opposite
in
a
moment
jonas
came
back
out
of
the
parlor
and
said
as
he
passed
through
goes
but
little
ways
a
short
piece
of
versification
which
all
boys
and
girls
would
do
well
to
remember
now
it
happened
that
all
this
time
mother
was
sitting
in
a
little
bedroom
which
had
a
door
opening
into
the
entry
where
lucy
and
rollo
had
been
reading
and
she
heard
all
the
conversation
she
knew
that
though
rollo
was
generally
a
good
boy
and
was
willing
to
know
his
faults
and
often
endeavored
to
correct
them
still
that
he
was
like
all
other
boys
prone
to
selfishness
and
to
vanity
and
she
thought
that
she
must
take
some
way
to
show
him
clearly
what
the
truth
really
was
about
his
disinterestedness
in
a
few
minutes
therefore
she
went
out
of
the
room
and
took
from
the
store
closet
an
apple
and
a
pear
they
were
both
good
but
the
pear
was
particularly
fine
it
was
large
mellow
and
juicy
she
then
went
back
to
her
seat
and
called
rollo
came
running
to
her
said
she
an
apple
and
a
pear
for
one
for
me
and
one
for
lucy
said
he
is
just
as
you
please
i
give
them
both
to
you
you
may
do
what
you
choose
with
rollo
took
the
fruit
much
pleased
and
walked
slowly
back
hesitating
what
to
do
he
thought
he
must
certainly
give
one
to
lucy
and
as
he
had
just
been
boasting
that
he
preferred
pleasure
to
his
own
he
was
ashamed
to
offer
her
the
apple
and
yet
he
wanted
the
pear
very
much
himself
if
he
had
had
a
little
more
time
he
would
have
hit
upon
a
plan
which
would
have
removed
all
the
difficulty
at
once
by
dividing
both
the
apple
and
the
pear
and
giving
to
lucy
half
of
each
but
he
did
not
think
of
this
in
fact
his
mother
knew
that
as
he
was
going
directly
bark
to
lucy
he
would
not
have
much
time
to
think
but
must
act
according
to
the
spontaneous
impulse
of
his
heart
but
though
he
did
not
think
of
dividing
the
apple
and
the
pear
he
happened
to
hit
upon
a
plan
which
occurred
to
him
just
as
he
was
going
back
into
the
entry
that
he
thought
would
do
he
held
the
fruit
behind
him
the
apple
in
one
hand
and
the
pear
in
the
other
lucy
saw
him
coming
and
said
have
you
got
rollo
will
you
have
right
hand
or
left
said
he
in
reply
rollo
held
forward
his
right
hand
and
lo
it
was
the
pear
but
he
could
not
bear
to
part
with
it
and
he
brought
forward
the
other
and
said
you
may
have
the
said
lucy
pear
is
fairly
mine
you
asked
me
which
i
would
have
and
i
said
the
i
want
the
pear
said
rollo
may
have
the
apple
mother
gave
them
both
to
want
the
pear
too
said
lucy
is
mine
and
you
must
give
it
to
just
then
a
voice
called
from
the
bedroom
mother
said
rollo
want
you
both
to
come
rollo
and
lucy
would
both
have
been
ashamed
of
their
contention
were
it
not
that
the
pear
looked
so
very
rich
and
tempting
that
they
were
both
very
eager
to
have
it
is
the
difficulty
said
mother
as
soon
as
they
stood
before
her
lucy
wants
the
pear
said
rollo
you
gave
them
both
to
me
and
said
i
might
do
as
i
pleased
with
them
i
am
willing
to
give
her
the
but
he
offered
me
my
choice
said
lucy
hand
or
left
and
i
chose
the
right
and
now
he
ought
to
give
it
to
are
you
willing
that
i
should
decide
it
said
the
lady
mother
and
aunt
said
rollo
and
lucy
together
have
both
done
wrong
not
wrong
but
a
little
wrong
and
i
think
neither
ought
to
have
the
whole
of
the
pear
so
i
shall
divide
the
pear
and
the
apple
both
between
you
and
i
will
tell
you
how
you
have
done
wrong
rollo
by
asking
her
which
she
would
have
implied
that
you
would
leave
it
to
chance
to
decide
and
that
you
would
let
her
have
her
fair
chance
then
you
ought
to
have
submitted
to
the
result
if
she
had
chosen
the
left
hand
she
ought
to
have
been
content
if
she
had
got
the
apple
you
would
have
had
the
credit
of
giving
her
an
equal
chance
with
you
and
she
ought
therefore
to
have
had
the
full
benefit
of
the
chance
then
you
lucy
did
wrong
for
although
rollo
asked
you
to
choose
he
did
not
you
your
choice
and
as
he
was
under
no
obligation
to
give
you
either
you
ought
not
to
have
insisted
upon
his
fulfilling
his
is
it
not
so
the
children
both
saw
and
admitted
that
it
was
best
way
i
think
she
continued
have
been
for
you
rollo
to
have
given
the
to
lucy
as
she
was
your
visitor
and
a
young
lady
too
then
she
would
have
given
you
half
in
eating
it
however
you
were
not
very
much
in
the
wrong
either
of
you
it
was
a
sort
of
a
doubtful
case
but
i
hope
you
see
from
it
rollo
what
i
wanted
to
teach
you
that
you
are
no
more
inclined
to
prefer
other
pleasure
to
your
own
than
other
children
are
remember
couplet
hereafter
i
think
it
is
a
very
good
one
now
go
and
get
a
knife
and
cut
the
fruit
and
see
it
does
not
rain
but
little
you
can
go
and
get
your
away
went
the
children
out
into
the
kitchen
after
a
knife
rollo
wanted
to
cut
the
apple
and
the
pear
himself
and
lucy
made
no
objection
and
we
must
do
him
the
justice
to
say
that
he
gave
rather
the
largest
half
of
each
to
lucy
they
then
went
out
into
the
shed
rollo
taking
with
him
a
dipper
of
water
to
wash
his
feet
when
he
came
back
from
the
garden
rollo
then
took
off
his
shoes
and
gave
lucy
his
share
of
the
fruit
to
keep
for
him
and
then
sallied
forth
into
the
yard
holding
the
umbrella
over
his
head
as
a
few
drops
of
rain
were
still
falling
he
waded
into
the
little
pond
at
the
garden
gate
and
then
turned
round
to
look
at
lucy
and
laugh
he
began
too
to
caper
about
in
the
water
but
lucy
told
him
to
take
care
or
he
would
fall
down
and
they
could
not
wash
his
as
they
could
his
feet
with
their
dipper
of
water
illustration
he
waded
into
the
little
pond
at
the
garden
gate
so
he
went
carefully
forward
till
he
came
to
the
peas
and
gathered
as
many
as
he
wanted
and
then
returned
as
he
was
coming
back
he
saw
jonas
in
the
barn
jonas
called
out
to
him
to
ask
what
he
had
got
have
been
to
get
some
said
he
make
boats
are
you
going
to
sail
them
said
jonas
in
this
little
pond
when
it
is
done
you
had
better
have
a
little
pond
in
the
can
we
said
rollo
might
have
it
in
a
we
can
could
you
come
and
get
it
for
us
in
a
few
the
time
you
get
your
boats
rollo
and
lucy
were
much
pleased
with
this
and
they
sat
down
one
on
each
side
of
the
pond
and
sailed
their
boats
a
long
time
he
cut
small
pieces
of
the
apple
and
of
the
pear
for
cargo
and
rollo
put
in
the
stem
of
the
pear
for
the
captain
of
his
boat
each
one
was
and
obliging
and
the
time
passed
away
very
pleasantly
until
it
was
near
when
they
came
in
to
dinner
they
observed
that
it
was
raining
again
very
fast
the
principles
of
order
said
rollo
at
the
you
think
it
will
rain
all
the
afternoon
looks
like
it
replied
his
father
why
do
you
not
enjoy
yourselves
in
the
house
yes
sir
said
rollo
have
had
a
fine
time
this
morning
but
lucy
and
i
thought
that
if
it
did
not
rain
this
afternoon
we
might
go
out
in
the
garden
a
may
clear
up
towards
night
but
if
it
does
i
think
it
would
be
better
to
go
down
to
the
brook
and
see
the
freshet
than
to
go
into
the
freshet
will
there
be
a
freshet
do
you
think
if
it
rains
this
afternoon
as
fast
as
it
does
now
i
think
the
brook
will
be
quite
high
towards
rollo
was
much
pleased
to
hear
this
he
told
lucy
after
dinner
that
the
brook
looked
magnificently
in
a
freshet
that
the
banks
were
brimming
full
and
the
water
poured
along
in
a
great
torrent
foaming
and
dashing
against
the
logs
and
rocks
besides
lucy
said
he
can
carry
down
our
little
boats
and
set
them
a
sailing
how
they
will
whirl
and
plunge
along
down
the
stream
lucy
liked
the
idea
of
seeing
the
freshet
too
very
much
though
she
said
she
was
afraid
it
would
be
too
wet
for
her
to
go
rollo
told
her
never
to
fear
for
his
father
would
contrive
some
way
to
get
her
down
there
safely
and
they
both
went
to
the
back
entry
door
again
looking
out
and
wishing
now
that
it
would
rain
faster
and
faster
as
they
did
before
dinner
that
it
would
cease
to
rain
said
lucy
if
it
should
not
stop
raining
at
all
it
will
said
rollo
know
it
will
besides
if
it
should
not
we
can
go
down
morning
you
know
and
then
there
will
be
a
bigger
freshet
o
how
full
the
brook
will
be
by
morning
and
rollo
clapped
his
hands
and
capered
with
delight
said
lucy
soberly
i
must
go
home
you
said
rollo
you
must
i
did
not
think
of
i
think
continued
he
it
will
certainly
clear
up
i
will
go
and
ask
father
if
he
does
not
think
so
they
both
went
together
back
into
the
parlor
to
ask
the
question
can
not
tell
my
children
whether
it
will
or
not
i
see
no
indications
one
way
or
the
other
i
think
you
had
better
forget
all
about
it
and
go
to
doing
something
else
for
if
you
spend
all
the
afternoon
in
watching
the
sky
and
trying
to
guess
whether
it
will
clear
up
or
not
you
can
not
enjoy
yourselves
and
may
be
sadly
disappointed
at
we
can
not
help
thinking
of
it
can
not
if
you
stand
there
at
the
back
door
doing
nothing
else
but
if
you
engage
in
some
other
employment
you
will
soon
forget
all
about
do
you
think
we
had
better
do
said
lucy
think
you
had
better
go
up
and
put
your
room
and
your
desk
all
in
order
rollo
lucy
can
help
father
i
have
put
it
in
order
a
great
many
times
and
it
always
gets
out
of
order
again
very
soon
and
i
can
not
keep
it
is
partly
because
you
do
not
put
it
in
order
right
you
do
not
understand
the
principles
of
are
the
principles
of
order
said
lucy
are
a
good
many
i
will
tell
you
some
of
them
and
then
you
may
go
and
apply
them
in
arranging
things
principle
is
to
have
the
things
that
are
most
frequently
used
in
the
most
accessible
place
so
that
they
can
be
taken
out
and
returned
to
their
proper
places
easily
good
principle
for
you
is
to
distinguish
between
the
things
which
you
wish
to
and
those
you
only
wish
to
the
former
ought
to
be
in
sight
and
near
at
hand
the
latter
may
be
packed
away
more
out
of
view
principle
is
to
avoid
having
your
desk
and
room
encumbered
with
things
of
little
or
no
value
as
stones
you
have
picked
up
and
papers
and
sticks
the
place
to
keep
such
things
is
in
the
barn
or
shed
not
in
your
private
room
you
must
arrange
your
things
systematically
putting
things
of
the
same
nature
together
once
i
looked
into
your
desk
after
you
had
put
it
in
order
and
i
found
that
in
the
back
side
of
it
you
had
piled
up
hooks
and
white
paper
and
pictures
and
a
slate
and
a
or
two
all
together
you
thought
they
were
in
order
because
they
were
in
a
now
they
ought
to
have
been
separated
and
arranged
all
the
white
paper
by
itself
in
front
where
you
can
easily
get
it
to
use
the
pictures
all
by
themselves
in
a
portfolio
and
the
books
should
be
arranged
not
in
a
but
in
a
on
their
edges
so
that
you
can
get
out
any
one
without
disturbing
the
others
those
are
some
of
the
principles
of
come
rollo
said
lucy
us
go
and
see
your
things
and
try
to
put
them
in
order
rollo
went
but
as
he
left
the
room
he
turned
round
to
ask
his
father
if
he
would
not
come
with
them
and
just
show
them
a
little
about
it
his
father
said
he
could
not
come
very
well
then
but
if
they
would
try
and
do
as
well
as
they
could
he
would
come
and
look
over
their
work
after
it
was
done
and
tell
them
whether
it
was
right
or
not
rollo
and
lucy
went
up
into
room
and
true
enough
they
found
not
a
little
confusion
there
but
they
went
to
work
and
soon
became
very
much
interested
in
their
employment
a
great
many
of
the
things
were
new
to
lucy
and
as
they
went
on
arranging
them
they
often
stopped
to
talk
and
play
in
this
way
several
hours
passed
along
very
pleasantly
and
when
at
last
they
had
got
them
nearly
arranged
rollo
went
to
the
window
to
throw
out
some
old
stones
that
he
concluded
not
to
keep
any
longer
when
he
exclaimed
aloud
lucy
lucy
come
here
illustration
lucy
ran
rollo
pointed
out
to
the
western
horizon
and
said
there
there
was
a
broad
band
of
bright
golden
sky
all
along
the
western
and
beautiful
and
extending
each
way
as
far
as
they
could
see
the
dark
clouds
overhead
reached
down
to
the
edge
of
this
clear
sky
where
they
hung
in
a
fringe
of
gold
and
the
dazzling
rays
of
the
sun
were
just
peeping
under
it
the
rain
had
ceased
rollo
and
lucy
gazed
at
it
a
moment
and
then
ran
down
stairs
as
fast
as
they
could
go
calling
out
is
clearing
away
it
is
clearing
away
father
it
is
clearing
away
we
can
go
and
see
the
clearing
up
they
went
out
upon
the
steps
to
look
at
the
sky
a
few
drops
of
rain
were
still
falling
but
the
clouds
appeared
to
be
breaking
in
several
places
and
the
tract
of
golden
sky
in
the
west
was
rising
and
extending
the
air
was
calm
and
the
golden
rays
of
the
sun
shone
upon
the
fields
and
trees
and
upon
the
glittering
drops
that
hung
from
the
leaves
and
branches
rollo
and
lucy
both
said
it
was
beautiful
they
went
in
and
urged
their
father
to
go
with
them
down
to
the
brook
to
see
the
freshet
but
he
said
they
must
wait
till
after
tea
is
too
wet
to
go
now
said
he
father
said
rollo
do
not
think
it
will
be
any
better
after
tea
the
ground
can
not
dry
in
half
an
said
his
father
the
water
will
run
off
of
the
paths
a
great
deal
so
that
we
can
get
along
much
but
then
it
will
run
off
from
the
brook
a
great
deal
too
and
the
freshet
will
not
be
so
is
a
little
different
with
the
brook
his
father
replied
that
is
very
long
and
the
water
comes
a
great
way
from
among
the
hills
now
while
we
are
taking
tea
the
water
will
be
running
into
the
brook
back
among
the
hills
faster
than
it
will
run
away
here
so
that
it
will
grow
higher
and
higher
for
some
rollo
had
no
more
to
say
but
he
was
impatient
to
go
he
and
lucy
went
out
and
stood
on
the
steps
again
the
clouds
were
breaking
up
and
flying
away
in
all
directions
and
large
patches
of
clear
blue
sky
appeared
everywhere
giving
promise
of
a
beautiful
evening
said
rollo
is
that
lucy
listened
it
was
a
sort
of
roaring
sound
down
in
the
woods
rollo
at
first
thought
it
was
a
bear
growling
you
think
it
is
a
bear
said
he
to
lucy
with
a
look
of
some
concern
bear
said
lucy
laughing
is
not
the
way
a
bear
growls
it
is
the
freshet
said
rollo
it
is
the
water
roaring
along
the
rollo
listened
and
he
immediately
perceived
that
it
was
the
sound
of
water
and
he
jumped
and
capered
with
delight
at
thinking
how
fine
a
sight
it
must
be
at
the
father
explained
the
plan
he
had
formed
for
their
going
he
said
it
was
rather
a
difficult
thing
to
go
and
see
a
freshet
without
getting
for
a
girl
he
and
rollo
he
said
could
put
on
their
good
thick
boots
but
lucy
had
none
suitable
for
such
a
walk
as
it
would
probably
be
very
wet
and
muddy
in
some
places
shall
we
do
then
said
rollo
believe
i
shall
let
jonas
go
down
and
draw
lucy
in
his
wagon
said
his
father
should
you
like
that
lucy
lucy
said
she
should
like
it
very
well
and
after
tea
they
went
out
to
the
door
where
they
found
jonas
with
his
wagon
all
ready
this
wagon
was
one
which
jonas
had
made
to
draw
rollo
upon
it
was
plain
and
simple
but
strong
and
convenient
and
perfectly
safe
they
helped
lucy
into
it
and
she
sat
down
on
the
little
seat
rollo
with
his
hoots
on
took
hold
behind
to
push
and
jonas
drew
father
walked
behind
and
thus
they
set
off
to
view
the
freshet
they
moved
along
carefully
through
the
yard
and
then
turned
by
the
gate
and
went
into
the
field
the
path
led
them
by
the
garden
fence
for
some
distance
and
they
went
along
very
pleasantly
for
a
time
until
at
length
they
came
to
a
large
pool
of
water
covering
the
whole
path
there
were
high
banks
on
each
side
so
that
the
wagon
could
not
turn
out
shall
we
do
now
said
rollo
can
go
right
through
it
said
jonas
is
not
we
can
go
along
on
the
bank
by
the
side
said
rollo
said
his
father
you
are
not
afraid
lucy
did
feel
a
little
afraid
at
first
but
she
knew
that
if
her
uncle
was
willing
that
she
should
go
there
could
not
be
any
danger
so
she
made
no
objection
besides
she
knew
that
as
jonas
was
to
walk
along
before
her
she
could
see
how
deep
it
was
and
there
could
not
be
any
deep
places
without
his
finding
it
out
before
the
wagon
went
into
them
jonas
was
barefoot
and
did
not
mind
wetting
his
feet
so
he
waded
in
drawing
the
wagon
after
him
it
was
about
up
to
his
ankles
all
the
way
lucy
looked
over
the
side
of
the
wagon
and
felt
a
little
fear
as
she
saw
the
wheels
half
under
water
but
they
went
safely
through
presently
they
began
to
descend
a
path
which
led
them
into
the
woods
they
heard
the
roaring
of
the
water
which
grew
louder
and
louder
as
they
drew
nigh
and
then
rollo
suddenly
stopped
and
said
father
it
is
raining
here
in
the
woods
lucy
listened
and
they
heard
the
drops
of
rain
falling
upon
the
ground
all
around
them
and
yet
looking
up
they
saw
that
the
sky
was
almost
perfectly
clear
presently
they
thought
that
this
was
only
the
drops
falling
off
from
the
leaves
of
the
trees
rollo
said
he
meant
to
see
if
it
was
so
and
he
ran
out
of
the
path
and
took
hold
of
a
slender
tree
with
a
large
top
of
branches
and
leaves
and
looking
up
to
see
if
any
drops
would
come
down
he
gave
it
a
good
shake
and
true
enough
down
came
a
perfect
shower
of
drops
all
into
his
face
and
eyes
at
first
he
was
astonished
at
such
an
unexpected
but
he
concluded
on
the
whole
to
laugh
and
not
cry
about
it
and
he
came
back
wiping
his
face
and
looking
comically
enough
all
the
party
laughed
a
little
at
his
mishap
and
then
went
on
in
a
few
minutes
more
they
came
in
sight
of
the
foaming
brook
the
water
was
very
high
in
some
places
the
banks
were
overflowed
and
the
current
swept
along
furiously
dashing
against
the
rocks
and
whirling
round
the
projecting
points
the
children
stopped
and
gazed
upon
the
scene
a
little
while
and
then
rollo
said
he
was
going
to
sail
his
boats
which
he
had
brought
in
his
pocket
just
then
jonas
saw
a
plank
which
was
lying
partly
on
the
bank
and
partly
in
the
water
a
little
up
the
stream
it
had
been
placed
across
the
brook
some
distance
above
for
a
bridge
but
the
freshet
had
brought
it
away
and
it
had
drifted
down
to
where
it
then
was
jonas
said
he
would
find
a
place
for
lucy
to
stand
upon
with
it
so
he
went
and
pushed
off
this
plank
and
let
it
float
down
to
where
the
children
were
standing
and
then
he
drew
it
up
upon
the
shore
and
laid
it
along
so
that
lucy
could
stand
upon
it
safely
and
launch
the
boats
these
boats
were
soon
all
borne
away
rapidly
down
the
stream
out
of
sight
and
then
they
threw
in
sticks
and
chips
and
watched
them
as
they
sailed
away
and
whirled
around
in
the
eddies
or
swept
down
the
rapids
thus
they
amused
themselves
a
long
time
and
then
slowly
returned
home
illustration
the
boats
were
soon
all
borne
away
blueberrying
old
trumpeter
mother
advised
him
when
he
went
to
bed
the
evening
before
the
day
fixed
upon
for
the
blueberrying
to
rise
early
the
next
morning
and
take
a
good
reading
lesson
before
breakfast
she
said
he
would
enjoy
himself
much
more
during
the
day
if
he
performed
all
his
usual
duties
before
he
went
rollo
accordingly
arose
quite
early
and
when
he
came
in
to
breakfast
had
the
satisfaction
of
telling
his
father
that
he
had
read
his
morning
lesson
and
prepared
his
basket
and
was
all
ready
to
go
he
wanted
jonas
to
go
too
and
as
the
last
time
when
he
asked
his
permission
that
he
should
go
he
lost
his
request
by
asking
it
in
an
improper
manner
he
determined
to
be
careful
this
time
so
he
was
silent
at
breakfast
time
while
his
father
and
mother
were
talking
and
then
watching
an
opportunity
when
they
seemed
disengaged
he
asked
his
father
if
jonas
might
not
go
with
them
do
not
think
he
can
very
well
for
there
is
no
room
for
him
both
the
chaises
will
be
could
not
he
ride
on
old
trumpeter
said
rollo
old
trumpeter
was
a
white
horse
that
had
served
the
family
some
time
but
was
now
rather
old
and
not
a
very
good
traveller
father
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
said
perhaps
he
might
may
go
and
tell
him
that
we
are
going
and
that
if
he
thinks
old
trumpeter
will
do
to
carry
him
he
may
go
he
will
be
of
great
help
to
us
if
we
should
get
into
any
rollo
thought
of
the
bears
that
he
expected
to
see
on
the
mountain
and
ran
to
tell
jonas
jonas
was
glad
to
go
so
he
went
and
gave
old
trumpeter
some
oats
and
got
the
saddle
and
bridle
ready
he
also
got
out
a
pair
of
that
he
always
used
on
such
occasions
and
put
into
them
a
hatchet
a
dipper
a
box
of
matches
and
some
rope
on
second
thoughts
he
concluded
it
would
be
best
to
put
these
things
into
the
and
to
put
the
on
his
horse
empty
as
he
might
want
them
to
bring
something
home
in
after
breakfast
lucy
and
her
father
uncle
george
drove
up
to
the
door
for
they
were
going
too
and
in
a
short
time
you
might
have
seen
all
the
party
driving
away
from
the
father
and
mother
in
the
first
chaise
uncle
george
and
rollo
and
lucy
in
the
second
and
jonas
on
old
trumpeter
behind
they
rode
on
for
a
mile
or
two
and
then
turned
off
of
the
main
road
into
the
woods
and
went
on
by
a
winding
and
beautiful
road
until
they
came
in
sight
of
a
range
of
mountains
one
of
which
seemed
very
high
and
near
that
benalgon
said
rollo
do
not
know
said
his
uncle
have
never
been
to
it
before
but
i
suppose
jonas
can
will
call
him
said
rollo
so
he
turned
round
and
kneeled
up
upon
the
seat
so
that
he
could
look
out
behind
the
chaise
for
the
back
curtain
was
up
lucy
did
the
same
but
jonas
was
not
to
be
seen
they
looked
a
little
longer
and
presently
saw
him
coming
along
round
a
curve
in
the
road
they
beckoned
to
him
and
as
he
rode
up
they
saw
he
had
a
bush
in
his
hand
he
came
up
to
the
side
of
the
chaise
and
handed
it
to
rollo
it
was
a
large
covered
with
beautiful
ripe
blue
berries
rollo
took
them
and
admired
them
very
much
and
at
first
he
was
going
to
divide
them
between
lucy
and
himself
but
they
concluded
on
the
whole
to
send
them
forward
to
his
mother
jonas
told
them
the
mountain
before
them
benalgon
and
rode
on
to
carry
the
to
the
other
chaise
presently
he
came
back
bringing
it
with
him
except
a
small
sprig
which
mother
had
taken
off
the
rest
she
had
sent
back
to
the
children
jonas
said
uncle
george
when
he
got
back
do
not
see
but
that
old
trumpeter
is
strong
enough
to
carry
you
yes
sir
said
jonas
is
strong
enough
to
carry
half
a
dozen
like
uncle
george
said
rollo
him
carry
me
too
with
jonas
i
can
ride
well
if
you
want
to
ride
with
him
a
little
while
you
may
if
jonas
is
jonas
was
and
rollo
got
out
and
climbed
up
upon
a
stump
by
the
side
of
the
road
jonas
drove
up
to
the
stump
and
rollo
clambered
up
behind
him
with
a
switch
in
his
hand
jonas
said
he
you
want
him
to
go
any
faster
you
just
speak
to
me
and
i
will
touch
him
up
with
my
jonas
said
he
would
and
they
jogged
along
behind
the
chaise
lucy
kneeled
upon
the
cushion
and
looked
out
behind
talking
with
rollo
deviation
they
went
on
so
very
quietly
for
some
time
until
jonas
said
there
was
a
turn
in
the
road
on
before
them
where
there
was
a
that
led
across
a
ravine
by
a
nearer
way
than
the
and
proposed
that
rollo
should
ask
leave
for
jonas
and
himself
to
go
across
on
horseback
and
wait
for
the
chaises
when
they
should
come
out
on
the
main
road
so
they
rode
up
to
the
chaise
and
rollo
put
the
question
to
his
uncle
george
his
reply
was
that
he
could
not
say
any
thing
about
it
rollo
must
go
and
ask
his
father
you
go
said
jonas
said
rollo
touch
up
old
trumpeter
so
rollo
applied
his
switch
and
the
horse
trotted
on
fast
rollo
had
hard
work
to
hold
on
but
he
clasped
his
arm
tight
around
waist
and
succeeded
in
keeping
his
seat
father
and
mother
were
riding
some
distance
before
them
but
they
saw
jonas
coming
up
and
rode
slowly
that
he
might
overtake
them
rollo
said
his
father
do
you
like
riding
double
much
said
rollo
we
want
you
to
let
jonas
and
i
cut
across
by
the

the
valley
and
wait
for

at
the
there
a
across
here
jonas
sir
said
jonas
it
a
good
path
is
rather
rough
sir
through
the
woods
and
bushes
but
it
is
a
pretty
good
father
sat
hesitating
a
moment
and
then
may
go
if
you
choose
but
i
advise
you
not
do
you
advise
us
not
to
said
rollo
you
may
get
into
some
difficulty
and
so
we
get
but
said
rollo
is
not
near
so
far
across
and
we
shall
have
time
to
get
through
to
the
mill
long
before
you
come
well
you
may
do
as
you
what
would
you
do
would
you
go
or
not
think
i
would
go
if
your
father
thinks
we
had
better
want
to
go
very
much
said
rollo
well
said
his
father
are
willing
to
go
with
him
i
suppose
jonas
are
you
not
yes
sir
said
jonas
said
rollo
us
go
we
will
he
very
careful
father
not
to
get
into
any
so
the
two
chaises
rode
on
and
jonas
and
rollo
in
a
few
minutes
turned
off
by
a
narrow
path
that
struck
into
the
woods
just
as
they
were
bending
down
their
heads
to
pass
under
a
great
branch
of
a
tree
rollo
looked
along
and
saw
lucy
waving
her
handkerchief
to
him
as
the
chaise
which
she
was
in
disappeared
by
a
turn
of
the
road
rollo
at
first
felt
a
little
uneasy
to
think
that
he
had
deserted
his
cousin
as
it
were
he
thought
that
he
should
not
have
liked
it
exactly
if
she
had
gone
off
and
left
him
alone
so
in
the
chaise
however
it
was
now
too
late
to
repent
and
his
attention
was
attracted
by
the
wild
and
romantic
scene
around
him
the
path
descended
obliquely
by
a
rough
wet
and
stony
way
through
a
dark
forest
he
heard
the
sighing
of
the
wind
in
the
tops
of
the
tall
trees
and
the
mellow
notes
of
forest
birds
far
off
and
high
which
came
rich
and
sweet
to
his
ear
with
a
peculiar
expression
of
solitude
and
loneliness
the
boys
rode
on
and
the
path
became
more
and
more
slippery
stony
and
steep
rollo
clung
tight
to
jonas
and
begun
to
be
somewhat
afraid
he
would
have
proposed
to
go
back
but
he
was
ashamed
to
do
it
after
a
little
time
he
asked
jonas
whether
the
path
was
as
bad
as
that
all
the
way
bad
as
this
said
jonas
call
this
very
good
i
will
show
you
the
bad
road
pretty
rollo
looked
frightened
but
said
nothing
road
seems
more
wet
than
common
said
jonas
suppose
on
account
of
the
rain
yesterday
and
i
declare
said
he
am
afraid
we
shall
find
the
brook
brook
up
said
rollo
did
not
i
think
of
that
before
however
we
must
go
on
said
rollo
can
not
we
go
back
because
we
should
be
too
late
besides
there
is
no
danger
only
we
may
have
to
wade
a
as
they
went
on
the
mud
in
the
road
grew
deeper
and
deeper
and
presently
old
legs
sunk
far
down
among
roots
and
mire
rollo
began
to
feel
more
and
more
alarmed
and
heartily
wished
that
he
had
taken
his
advice
soon
alter
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
path
for
some
distance
before
them
was
full
of
water
deep
and
miry
jonas
said
he
thought
that
they
had
better
go
out
upon
one
side
so
he
made
the
horse
step
over
a
log
and
go
in
among
the
trees
and
bushes
the
branches
brushed
and
scratched
rollo
unmercifully
though
he
bent
down
and
leaned
over
to
this
side
and
that
continually
to
escape
them
he
asked
jonas
why
this
path
had
not
dried
as
well
as
the
main
road
where
the
chaises
had
gone
and
jonas
told
him
that
the
sun
and
the
wind
were
the
great
means
of
drying
the
open
road
but
that
this
narrow
and
secluded
path
was
shaded
from
the
sun
and
sheltered
from
the
wind
and
that
the
water
consequently
remained
a
long
time
among
the
moss
and
roots
and
mire
after
a
time
they
got
back
into
the
path
again
and
going
on
a
little
farther
they
came
down
to
the
margin
of
the
brook
they
found
that
it
as
jonas
had
feared
at
the
place
where
the
path
went
down
and
crossed
the
brook
a
deep
cut
had
been
worn
in
the
two
opposite
banks
and
this
was
filled
with
water
and
above
and
below
the
stream
rushed
on
in
a
torrent
jonas
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
asked
rollo
if
he
thought
he
could
hold
on
while
they
riding
through
rollo
said
he
was
afraid
it
was
so
deep
as
to
drown
them
jonas
then
said
that
he
might
get
off
and
stand
upon
a
rock
by
the
side
of
the
path
while
he
rode
through
first
to
see
how
it
was
and
that
then
he
would
come
back
for
him
so
rollo
got
off
in
fear
and
trembling
and
stood
on
the
rock
while
jonas
urged
his
horse
into
the
water
old
trumpeter
did
not
much
like
this
kind
of
travelling
but
jonas
half
persuaded
and
half
compelled
him
to
go
through
when
he
was
in
the
middle
the
water
came
up
so
high
that
jonas
was
obliged
to
lift
up
his
feet
to
keep
them
from
being
wet
presently
however
it
became
more
shoal
as
the
horse
walked
slowly
along
and
at
last
he
fairly
reached
the
dry
ground
and
stood
dripping
on
the
bank
rollo
was
glad
to
see
that
the
water
was
no
deeper
but
was
still
afraid
to
go
over
he
told
jonas
he
go
over
i
here
and
that
he
go
back
with
him
said
jonas
would
not
be
said
rollo
can
ride
fast
and
overtake
very
soon
said
jonas
we
go
back
now
they
will
get
to
the
mill
before
us
and
then
will
be
very
anxious
and
unhappy
thinking
that
something
has
happened
to
us
and
perhaps
your
father
will
come
through
here
after
us
now
it
was
your
own
plan
coming
across
here
and
you
ought
not
to
make
other
people
suffer
by
it
your
father
advised
you
not
to
know
it
said
rollo
a
foolish
boy
i
was
i
shall
certainly
be
no
said
jonas
is
no
real
danger
or
i
should
not
make
you
go
and
so
saying
he
came
back
slowly
through
the
water
said
he
is
not
very
little
mosette
after
some
further
persuasion
rollo
got
on
behind
him
and
they
began
to
in
make
their
way
slowly
through
the
water
again
old
trumpeter
staggered
along
but
not
very
unsteadily
on
the
whole
until
he
got
a
little
past
the
middle
when
he
blundered
upon
a
stone
on
the
bottom
which
he
could
not
see
and
fell
down
on
his
knees
jonas
caught
up
his
feet
in
an
instant
and
rollo
had
his
already
drawn
up
behind
him
and
they
both
grasped
the
saddle
convulsively
the
horse
happened
to
regain
his
feet
again
in
a
moment
so
that
they
contrived
to
hold
on
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
drawn
out
safely
upon
the
shore
without
even
getting
their
feet
wet
old
trumpeter
said
jonas
have
done
pretty
well
for
you
and
you
have
got
the
mire
washed
off
your
legs
at
any
rate
but
rollo
what
is
that
he
pointed
back
as
he
said
this
to
a
little
tuft
floating
round
and
round
in
a
small
eddy
made
by
a
turn
of
the
brook
just
above
where
they
had
crossed
he
turned
his
horse
towards
it
is
a
nest
said
he
it
is
said
rollo
i
verily
believe
there
is
a
little
bird
in
illustration
jonas
jumped
off
of
the
horse
handed
the
bridle
to
rollo
and
took
up
a
long
stick
lying
on
the
ground
and
very
gently
and
cautiously
drew
the
nest
in
to
the
shore
he
took
it
up
with
great
care
and
brought
it
to
rollo
there
was
a
little
bird
in
it
scarcely
fledged
jonas
said
he
believed
it
was
a
robin
and
that
it
must
have
been
washed
off
from
its
place
on
some
bush
by
the
freshet
in
the
brook
the
bottom
of
the
nest
was
soaked
through
by
the
water
as
if
it
had
been
floating
some
time
and
the
little
bird
kept
opening
its
mouth
wide
the
poor
little
thing
was
hungry
and
heard
jonas
and
rollo
and
thought
they
were
its
mother
come
to
give
it
something
to
eat
shall
we
do
with
him
said
rollo
will
die
if
we
leave
him
here
said
jonas
he
has
lost
his
mother
now
i
think
we
had
better
carry
him
home
if
we
can
and
feed
him
till
he
is
old
enough
to
is
hungry
said
rollo
us
feed
him
have
not
any
thing
to
feed
him
with
perhaps
i
can
catch
a
fly
or
a
that
will
not
do
said
rollo
might
as
well
kill
him
as
kill
a
jonas
could
not
reply
to
this
and
they
concluded
to
carry
nest
and
all
carefully
to
the
mill
and
show
it
to
father
there
but
how
to
carry
it
was
the
difficulty
if
either
of
them
undertook
to
hold
it
in
one
hand
he
was
afraid
the
bird
might
be
jolted
out
and
neither
of
them
had
but
one
hand
to
spare
for
rollo
must
have
one
hand
to
hold
on
with
and
jonas
one
to
drive
at
last
jonas
took
off
his
cap
and
placed
it
bottom
upwards
on
the
saddle
before
him
and
put
the
nest
with
the
bird
in
it
in
that
and
then
drove
carefully
along
the
road
grew
much
smoother
and
better
after
they
passed
the
brook
and
after
going
on
a
short
distance
farther
they
came
in
sight
of
the
mill
they
had
been
detained
so
long
that
the
chaises
had
reached
the
mill
before
them
and
the
party
in
the
chaises
were
looking
out
down
the
path
where
they
expected
the
boys
were
to
come
out
watching
for
them
with
considerable
interest
they
come
at
last
said
lucy
as
she
perceived
a
movement
among
the
bushes
and
saw
old
white
head
coming
forward
said
mother
they
have
met
with
some
accident
jonas
has
lost
his
by
this
time
the
boys
had
emerged
from
the
bushes
and
were
coming
along
the
path
slowly
jonas
bareheaded
and
rollo
holding
on
carefully
lucy
saw
that
jonas
was
holding
something
before
him
on
the
saddle
and
wondered
what
it
was
mother
said
she
was
afraid
they
had
got
hurt
as
soon
as
they
came
within
hearing
rollo
heard
his
voice
calling
out
to
him
what
is
the
matter
have
you
got
into
any
difficulty
sir
said
rollo
had
some
difficulty
and
i
should
be
sorry
i
did
not
take
your
advice
only
then
we
should
not
have
found
this
little
bird
said
they
all
by
this
time
they
had
come
up
near
the
chaises
and
jonas
carefully
lifted
the
birdsnest
out
of
his
cap
and
held
it
so
that
they
could
all
see
it
while
rollo
told
them
the
story
they
all
looked
much
pleased
but
lucy
seemed
in
delight
she
wanted
to
have
it
go
in
their
chaise
and
asked
rollo
to
let
her
hold
the
nest
in
her
lap
rollo
did
not
answer
very
directly
for
he
was
busy
looking
at
the
bird
him
open
his
mouth
and
wishing
he
had
something
to
give
him
to
eat
said
he
shall
we
feed
him
with
jonas
was
going
to
catch
a
grasshopper
but
i
thought
that
would
not
be
not
said
uncle
george
said
rollo
has
as
good
a
right
to
his
life
as
the
bird
has
not
he
father
exactly
said
his
father
bird
is
an
animal
of
much
higher
grade
than
a
grasshopper
and
is
probably
much
more
sensible
of
pain
and
pleasure
and
his
life
is
of
more
value
just
as
a
man
is
a
much
higher
animal
than
a
bird
it
would
be
right
to
kill
a
bird
to
save
a
life
even
if
he
were
only
an
animal
and
so
it
would
be
right
to
destroy
a
grasshopper
or
a
worm
to
save
a
i
read
in
a
book
once
said
lucy
when
we
tread
on
a
worm
he
feels
as
much
pain
in
being
killed
as
a
giant
do
not
think
it
is
true
said
he
think
that
there
is
a
vast
diversity
among
the
different
animals
in
respect
to
their
sensibility
to
pain
according
to
their
structure
and
the
delicacy
of
their
organization
i
think
a
crew
of
a
might
catch
a
whole
cargo
of
mackerel
and
not
cause
as
much
pain
as
one
of
their
men
would
suffer
in
having
his
leg
bitten
off
by
a
father
said
rollo
you
think
we
had
better
give
him
a
grasshopper
no
said
lucy
grasshopper
would
not
be
good
to
eat
he
has
got
so
many
elbows
sticking
out
let
us
give
him
some
yes
said
rollo
would
be
so
he
slid
down
off
of
old
back
and
ran
to
the
side
of
the
road
to
see
if
he
could
not
find
some
blueberries
he
brought
a
few
in
his
hand
and
his
father
took
them
saying
that
he
would
feed
the
bird
for
him
he
squeezed
out
pulp
of
the
berries
and
then
made
a
chirping
sound
when
the
bird
opened
his
mouth
and
he
fed
him
with
the
soft
pulp
and
threw
away
the
skins
after
giving
the
bird
two
or
three
berries
in
this
way
they
put
him
back
into
the
nest
and
gave
the
nest
to
lucy
to
hold
in
her
lap
and
all
the
party
prepared
to
go
on
they
rode
along
about
a
mile
farther
and
then
came
to
the
place
where
they
must
leave
the
horses
and
prepare
to
ascend
the
mountain
on
foot
they
unharnessed
them
so
that
they
might
stand
more
quietly
and
then
fastened
them
to
trees
by
the
side
of
the
road
while
they
were
thus
taking
care
of
their
horses
rollo
and
lucy
were
standing
by
with
mother
looking
at
the
bird
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
rollo
said
his
mother
i
should
like
to
carry
him
home
and
keep
him
if
you
are
am
on
one
is
that
must
keep
him
in
a
cage
with
the
door
always
open
so
that
as
soon
as
he
is
old
enough
to
fly
away
he
may
go
if
he
he
will
certainly
fly
away
and
we
shall
lose
him
forever
said
lucy
is
the
only
condition
replied
mother
why
mother
said
he
may
we
not
keep
him
shut
up
safe
i
were
to
tell
you
the
reasons
now
they
would
not
satisfy
you
you
are
so
eager
to
keep
him
i
think
you
had
better
determine
to
comply
with
the
condition
and
say
no
more
about
it
but
try
to
think
of
a
name
for
mother
what
do
you
think
would
be
a
good
name
do
not
know
you
and
lucy
must
think
of
just
then
uncle
george
finished
tying
his
horse
and
came
along
to
where
the
children
were
standing
and
hearing
their
conversation
and
finding
that
lucy
and
rollo
were
perplexed
about
a
name
he
told
them
he
thought
they
might
not
improperly
call
him
noah
as
like
noah
by
floating
in
a
sort
of
ark
he
was
saved
from
a
flood
think
he
was
more
like
moses
than
noah
said
lucy
said
her
father
moses
was
a
little
thing
when
they
found
him
and
then
the
ark
of
bulrushes
was
something
like
a
birdsnest
i
think
you
had
better
name
him
moses
rollo
said
she
rollo
seemed
a
little
at
a
loss
he
said
he
thought
he
was
a
good
deal
like
moses
but
then
he
did
not
think
that
moses
was
a
very
pretty
name
for
a
bird
you
think
it
is
mother
said
he
do
not
know
but
that
it
would
do
very
well
you
might
alter
it
a
little
call
him
mosette
if
you
think
that
would
be
any
better
for
a
rollo
and
lucy
repeated
the
name
mosette
to
themselves
several
times
and
concluded
that
they
should
like
it
very
much
by
this
time
the
horses
were
all
ready
and
jonas
recommended
that
they
should
hide
mosette
away
somewhere
until
they
returned
from
the
mountain
for
it
would
be
troublesome
to
them
and
somewhat
dangerous
to
the
bird
to
carry
him
up
and
down
the
children
approved
of
this
plan
though
they
were
rather
unwilling
to
part
with
the
bird
at
all
they
went
just
into
the
bushes
and
found
a
very
secret
place
by
the
corner
of
a
large
rock
where
the
shrubs
and
wild
flowers
grew
thick
so
that
it
would
be
entirely
out
of
sight
going
up
they
then
set
forward
the
children
in
advance
of
the
rest
jonas
walked
with
rollo
and
lucy
and
he
had
round
his
waist
a
broad
leather
belt
which
he
always
wore
on
such
occasions
and
which
had
on
one
side
his
hatchet
and
knife
and
on
the
other
a
sort
of
bag
or
pocket
containing
several
things
such
as
matches
a
little
dipper
father
and
mother
and
his
uncle
george
walked
along
behind
them
the
way
was
for
some
distance
a
sort
of
too
steep
and
rough
for
a
chaise
but
hard
and
dry
and
pretty
comfortable
walking
rollo
and
lucy
asked
jonas
if
he
would
not
tell
them
a
story
as
they
went
along
to
beguile
the
way
jonas
began
a
story
about
a
boy
that
lived
a
long
time
on
a
mountain
alone
but
he
had
not
proceeded
far
before
they
heard
a
voice
behind
calling
them
they
looked
buck
and
saw
that
father
was
beckoning
them
to
stop
they
waited
till
he
came
up
and
he
told
them
he
wanted
to
give
them
their
orders
for
the
day
and
they
were
rules
he
said
which
ought
to
be
observed
on
all
berrying
expeditions
by
children
said
he
keep
in
sight
of
for
this
purpose
watch
me
all
the
time
when
we
are
stepping
and
keep
before
rather
than
behind
when
we
are
walking
take
no
unnecessary
steps
but
keep
in
the
right
path
and
walk
slowly
and
steadily
there
so
as
to
save
your
strength
otherwise
you
will
get
tired
out
very
soon
do
not
touch
any
flower
or
berry
that
you
see
except
blueberries
without
first
showing
them
to
one
of
the
children
listened
to
these
rules
and
promised
to
obey
them
and
then
walked
on
they
tried
to
walk
slowly
and
steadily
listening
to
story
they
turned
off
after
a
time
into
a
narrower
and
steeper
path
and
ascended
stepping
from
stone
to
stone
the
trees
and
bushes
hung
over
their
heads
making
the
walk
shady
and
cool
after
slowly
ascending
in
this
way
for
some
time
they
came
out
of
the
woods
into
an
opening
of
rocky
ground
and
patches
of
blue
they
saw
also
at
some
distance
before
them
three
or
four
boys
sitting
upon
a
rock
with
pails
and
baskets
in
their
hands
talking
and
laughing
loud
they
did
not
take
much
notice
of
them
but
walked
on
quietly
they
were
going
on
directly
towards
them
but
father
called
them
and
pointed
for
them
to
turn
off
to
the
right
round
a
rocky
precipice
which
was
in
that
direction
the
children
were
turning
accordingly
when
they
heard
a
shout
from
the
boys
before
them
this
way
and
we
will
show
you
where
the
blueberries
said
rollo
as
he
stopped
and
turned
round
to
his
father
boys
say
they
will
show
us
the
blueberries
out
that
way
shall
we
go
and
see
said
his
father
in
a
low
voice
so
that
the
boys
did
not
hear
go
the
way
i
told
they
went
along
and
presently
got
round
the
precipice
out
of
sight
of
i
he
boys
again
they
walked
slowly
until
their
parents
overtook
them
said
rollo
could
you
not
let
us
go
out
with
those
boys
they
said
they
were
thickest
out
said
he
presume
they
are
not
good
boys
and
i
do
not
want
you
to
have
any
thing
to
do
with
father
they
must
be
good
boys
or
they
would
not
want
to
show
us
the
blueberries
if
they
were
bad
selfish
boys
they
would
want
to
keep
all
the
good
places
to
if
rollo
had
only
asked
his
father
in
a
modest
manner
how
it
could
be
that
the
boys
were
bad
when
they
wanted
to
show
him
the
best
place
for
blueberries
it
would
have
been
very
proper
but
his
manner
of
speaking
showed
a
silly
confidence
in
his
own
opinion
which
was
very
wrong
his
father
however
did
not
attempt
to
reason
with
him
but
only
said
think
they
are
bad
boys
for
i
overheard
them
using
bad
language
and
i
wish
you
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
he
then
found
a
good
place
for
them
to
begin
to
gather
their
berries
it
was
a
beautiful
spot
of
open
ground
between
the
thick
woods
on
one
side
and
a
broken
rocky
precipice
on
the
other
uncle
george
took
jonas
forward
alone
until
they
were
out
of
sight
and
presently
returned
without
him
rollo
asked
where
jonas
was
gone
and
his
uncle
told
him
that
that
was
a
secret
at
present
they
heard
soon
after
the
strokes
of
his
hatchet
in
the
woods
on
before
them
but
could
not
imagine
what
he
could
be
doing
thus
things
went
on
very
pleasantly
and
they
gathered
a
large
quantity
of
berries
there
was
indeed
in
the
course
of
the
day
a
serious
difficulty
between
rollo
and
the
bad
boys
and
there
is
an
account
of
it
given
in
the
next
story
of
on
the
with
ibis
exception
every
thing
went
on
well
until
about
noon
when
rollo
observed
that
jonas
had
been
missing
a
long
time
the
secret
out
is
jonas
all
this
time
said
rollo
to
lucy
lucy
said
that
he
had
been
busy
a
long
time
doing
something
over
beyond
some
rocks
but
she
did
not
know
what
for
her
father
told
her
she
must
not
go
to
see
rollo
wondered
what
the
secret
was
and
he
was
just
going
to
ask
his
father
to
let
him
go
and
see
what
jonas
was
doing
when
they
saw
him
coming
out
from
the
bushes
he
came
up
to
father
and
told
him
that
it
was
all
ready
then
father
called
to
all
the
company
and
told
them
it
was
time
to
stop
gathering
berries
and
they
might
take
up
their
baskets
and
follow
him
the
baskets
and
pails
were
heavy
and
full
and
the
whole
party
walked
along
carrying
them
carefully
towards
the
place
where
jonas
had
come
from
hither
led
the
way
they
entered
into
a
little
thicket
and
passed
through
it
by
a
narrow
path
they
came
out
presently
into
a
sort
of
opening
on
a
brow
of
the
mountain
on
one
side
they
could
look
down
upon
a
vast
extent
of
country
exhibiting
a
beautiful
variety
of
forests
rivers
villages
and
farms
on
the
other
side
was
a
rocky
precipice
rising
abruptly
to
a
considerable
height
and
then
sloping
off
towards
the
summit
of
the
mountain
they
walked
along
a
few
steps
on
a
smooth
surface
of
the
rock
between
patches
of
grass
and
until
lucy
and
rollo
ran
forward
to
a
brook
which
came
foaming
down
the
precipice
and
then
after
tumbling
along
over
rocks
a
little
way
took
another
foaming
leap
down
the
mountain
and
was
lost
among
the
trees
below
the
party
all
stepped
carefully
over
this
brook
and
then
walked
along
up
the
bank
on
the
opposite
side
until
they
came
to
the
precipice
here
they
were
surprised
and
pleased
to
see
a
large
bower
built
in
front
of
a
little
sort
of
cavern
or
recess
in
the
rock
jonas
had
built
it
of
large
limbs
of
trees
and
bushes
which
he
had
leaned
up
against
the
rock
in
such
a
manner
as
to
enclose
a
large
space
within
there
was
an
opening
left
round
on
the
farther
side
next
the
rock
and
they
all
went
round
mid
went
first
then
lucy
then
the
others
they
found
that
smooth
and
clean
logs
and
stones
were
arranged
around
the
sides
of
the
bower
and
in
the
middle
on
a
carpet
of
leaves
was
very
abundant
provision
for
a
rustic
dinner
there
was
bread
and
butter
and
ham
and
gingerbread
and
pie
and
glasses
for
water
from
the
brook
rollo
and
lucy
wondered
how
all
those
things
could
have
got
up
the
mountain
presently
however
they
recollected
that
when
they
were
coming
up
jonas
had
two
covered
baskets
to
bring
and
they
thought
at
the
time
that
they
seemed
to
be
heavy
thus
the
day
passed
away
and
towards
evening
they
came
down
the
mountain
some
remarkable
things
happened
when
they
were
coming
down
which
will
be
related
in
the
story
called
on
the
trouble
on
the
mountain
boasting
pleasant
it
is
here
said
rollo
to
his
cousin
lucy
as
they
were
gathering
blueberries
high
up
on
old
mount
benalgon
the
day
they
went
up
with
father
and
mother
and
uncle
how
thick
the
blueberries
are
lucy
said
lucy
are
very
thick
i
think
and
how
far
we
can
see
now
we
are
up
here
so
high
i
wish
we
were
up
on
that
great
high
rollo
looked
where
lucy
pointed
and
he
saw
away
above
them
a
rocky
summit
projecting
out
from
the
mountain
the
front
of
the
rock
was
ragged
and
precipitous
but
it
was
flat
and
mossy
upon
the
top
and
firs
and
other
evergreen
trees
grew
there
some
of
them
hanging
over
the
edge
wish
i
could
get
up
there
said
lucy
wish
i
could
too
said
rollo
should
like
to
climb
up
one
of
those
trees
which
hangs
over
and
then
i
could
look
rollo
said
lucy
would
not
dare
to
climb
up
one
of
those
i
should
dare
to
said
rollo
rollo
was
sometimes
a
proud
boasting
boy
pretending
that
he
could
do
great
things
and
talking
very
largely
this
was
one
of
his
greatest
faults
and
whenever
he
seemed
to
be
in
this
boasting
mood
he
almost
always
got
into
some
difficulty
after
it
there
is
a
text
in
the
bible
that
was
proved
true
very
often
in
case
it
is
cometh
before
destruction
and
a
haughty
spirit
before
a
rollo
had
a
sad
tall
this
day
though
it
was
not
from
that
high
rock
it
was
a
different
sort
of
a
fall
from
that
as
we
shall
presently
see
said
he
again
do
not
believe
but
that
i
could
get
up
upon
that
rock
myself
i
can
climb
no
you
could
not
said
lucy
yes
i
see
a
way
round
by
that
great
black
log
there
is
a
path
there
through
the
no
said
lucy
could
not
get
up
there
but
there
are
some
boys
by
that
log
what
boys
are
they
rollo
looked
they
were
some
boys
which
they
had
seen
coming
up
the
mountain
and
father
had
warned
him
not
to
go
near
them
they
had
wanted
rollo
to
go
with
them
before
but
his
father
had
forbidden
it
rollo
wanted
to
go
and
now
he
was
glad
to
see
them
again
but
lucy
was
sorry
getting
in
trouble
the
blueberries
were
very
thick
and
large
and
the
bottoms
of
the
baskets
were
soon
covered
with
them
each
one
picked
where
he
found
them
most
plenty
rollo
and
lucy
kept
pretty
near
together
talking
and
gradually
strayed
away
to
some
distance
from
the
rest
of
the
party
after
a
little
while
rollo
looked
up
and
saw
the
three
boys
pretty
near
them
as
soon
as
lucy
saw
them
so
near
she
moved
along
towards
their
parents
and
rollo
ought
to
have
done
so
too
but
he
remained
where
he
was
and
presently
one
of
the
boys
came
up
to
him
did
you
not
come
up
where
we
were
said
he
were
thicker
out
father
would
not
let
me
said
rollo
come
along
said
the
boy
will
not
care
besides
he
will
not
know
it
he
is
busy
picking
by
himself
he
does
not
mind
where
you
rollo
thought
this
was
not
exactly
the
way
that
a
good
boy
would
speak
of
obeying
a
father
but
he
wanted
very
much
to
see
the
place
where
the
berries
were
so
much
thicker
far
is
it
said
he
to
the
boy
it
is
only
a
little
around
that
by
this
time
the
other
two
boys
came
up
and
they
talked
with
rollo
a
little
while
and
endeavored
to
persuade
him
to
go
he
said
finally
that
he
would
go
and
ask
his
father
so
he
left
his
basket
and
went
and
asked
his
father
if
he
might
just
go
with
those
boys
round
the
rock
he
said
the
blueberries
were
much
thicker
around
there
and
also
that
he
had
been
talking
with
the
boys
and
he
was
sure
they
were
good
boys
rollo
said
his
father
decidedly
can
not
think
that
any
boys
that
use
bad
language
can
be
good
boys
or
safe
companions
for
you
i
had
rather
you
would
keep
with
us
if
they
speak
to
you
answer
them
civilly
but
the
less
you
have
to
say
to
them
or
do
with
them
the
better
in
fact
i
had
rather
you
would
not
go
back
to
them
at
must
said
rollo
get
my
he
accordingly
returned
to
his
basket
and
told
the
boys
that
his
father
preferred
that
he
should
stay
where
he
was
the
biggest
boy
of
the
three
was
a
ragged
and
boy
the
others
called
him
jim
and
he
talked
with
rollo
a
good
deal
conscience
reproved
him
for
not
leaving
them
and
going
back
to
his
father
but
he
wanted
to
stay
and
hear
their
talk
and
he
quieted
his
conscience
by
saying
to
himself
that
his
father
told
him
to
treat
them
civilly
at
first
the
boys
were
careful
what
they
said
to
rollo
but
at
length
jim
grew
more
and
more
hold
he
used
language
which
rollo
knew
was
wrong
and
he
told
rollo
that
he
was
a
fool
to
stick
so
close
to
his
father
that
he
was
big
enough
to
find
his
way
alone
all
over
the
mountain
if
he
was
of
a
mind
to
all
this
rollo
was
silly
enough
to
believe
and
as
his
father
only
required
him
to
keep
in
sight
he
thought
he
would
show
the
boys
that
he
was
not
so
much
afraid
as
they
thought
he
was
and
so
hi
gradually
moved
off
farther
and
farther
from
his
parents
as
he
went
on
gradually
filling
up
his
basket
lucy
in
the
mean
time
went
nearer
and
nearer
to
them
and
in
a
short
time
was
safely
gathering
her
blueberries
by
her
side
things
went
on
so
for
an
hour
mother
asked
his
father
whether
he
had
not
better
call
rollo
to
them
said
he
have
told
him
his
duty
once
plainly
and
now
if
he
does
not
do
it
he
must
take
the
consequences
i
believe
i
shall
leave
him
to
the
boys
went
on
talking
to
one
another
and
to
rollo
telling
various
stories
about
their
running
away
from
school
stealing
apples
and
such
things
rollo
was
much
interested
in
listening
to
them
though
he
knew
all
the
time
that
he
was
doing
wrong
but
he
had
not
the
courage
to
leave
them
abruptly
as
he
ought
to
have
done
and
go
back
to
his
father
rollo
took
a
great
deal
of
pains
with
the
berries
he
picked
he
chose
the
largest
and
ripest
and
was
very
careful
not
to
get
in
any
sticks
and
leaves
his
basket
was
small
and
he
intended
as
soon
as
he
got
it
full
to
carry
it
carefully
to
his
mother
and
pour
his
berries
into
her
large
tin
pail
he
was
succeeding
finely
in
this
but
then
he
had
insensibly
strayed
away
so
far
from
his
father
that
now
he
was
entirely
out
of
his
sight
at
length
as
jim
was
sitting
on
a
log
to
rest
himself
as
he
said
he
saw
a
little
bird
alight
on
the
branch
of
a
black
stump
near
said
he
is
a
see
how
i
will
fix
so
saying
he
picked
up
a
stone
and
was
going
to
throw
it
rollo
begged
him
not
to
kill
that
pretty
little
bird
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
what
rollo
said
he
threw
the
stone
with
all
his
force
but
fortunately
it
did
not
hit
the
bird
it
struck
the
limb
that
the
bird
was
perched
upon
and
shivered
it
to
fragments
and
the
bird
flew
away
terrified
what
did
you
do
that
for
said
rollo
might
have
hit
him
said
he
meant
to
hit
him
to
be
what
good
does
it
do
to
kill
little
birds
i
found

this
morning
and
i
would
not
kill
him
for
any
did

find
him
said
jim
rollo
then
told
the
boys
all
about
his
finding
a
little
bird
in
its
nest
floating
in
the
brook
and
about
their
naming
him
mosette
as
is
described
in
the
story
called
and
jim
said
if
he
had
found
him
he
would
have
put
him
on
a
fence
for
a
mark

have
made
him

he
rollo

was
going
to

him
home
and
feed
him
and
tame
him
where

now
said
jim

hid
him
behind
a
stone

foot

mountain

horses
are
how
can
you
find
him
again
said
jim
said

behind
the
corner
of
a
stone
just
in
the
bushes
where
we
tied
the
jim
winked
at
the
other
boys
when
rollo
said
this
though
rollo
did
not
see
it
he
was
vexed
with
rollo
because
he
reproved
him
for
stoning
the
bird
would
set
him
up
for
a
mark
if
i
had
him
said
jim
wish
i
had
been
there
when
you
found
him
i
would
have
taken
him
away
from

not
have

him
away
jonas
would
not
let
who

jonas
and
what
do

think
i
care
for
jonas
said
he
he
then
came
up
to
rollo
and
looked
into
his
basket
and
saw
it
nearly
full
of
large
ripe
blueberries
i
believe
said
he
you
have
stolen
some
of
my
berries
out
of
my
basket
while
i
have
been
sitting
i
have
not
said
rollo
have
not
touched
your
have
said
jim
fiercely
i
will
have
them
back
again
besides
i
put
some
into
yours
while
you
went
to
your
father
so
half
the
berries
in
your
basket
are
this
was
a
lie
but
bad
boys
like
jim
will
always
lie
when
they
have
any
thing
to
gain
by
it
he
came
up
to
rollo
and
began
to
pull
his
basket
away
from
him
rollo
struggled
against
him
and
began
to
cry
but
jim
was
too
strong
for
him
he
tipped
his
basket
over
poured
a
great
many
of
the
berries
into
his
own
basket
and
the
rest
were
spilled
over
on
to
the
ground
then
angry
at
screams
and
cries
he
trampled
on
all
the
berries
that
were
on
the
ground
and
was
beginning
to
run
away
rollo
caught
hold
of
the
skirt
of
his
coat
screaming
all
the
time
for
his
father
jim
turned
round
and
struck
rollo
with
his
fist
knocked
him
down
and
then
he
and
the
other
boys
set
off
as
fast
as
they
could
run
through
the
bushes
and
they
disappeared
just
as
father
and
jonas
came
hastening
to
his
aid
illustration
they
raised
rollo
up
and
his
father
took
him
in
his
arms
to
carry
him
away
he
saw
that
there
had
been
some
serious
difficulty
with
the
bad
boys
but
he
did
not
ask
rollo
any
thing
about
it
then
for
he
knew
that
he
could
not
talk
intelligibly
till
he
had
done
crying
rollo
laid
his
head
down
on
his
shoulder
as
he
walked
along
and
sobbed
bitterly
a
test
of
penitence
his
father
carried
him
back
to
where
his
mother
and
uncle
were
who
were
coming
towards
him
looking
anxiously
they
presently
got
pretty
near
them
rollo
still
continuing
to
cry
his
father
then
said
to
him
be
still
a
moment
i
want
to
speak
to
when
he
first
took
rollo
up
he
did
not
command
him
to
be
still
for
he
knew
that
it
would
do
no
good
he
was
then
so
overwhelmed
with
pain
and
terror
that
he
could
not
help
crying
and
his
father
never
commanded
impossibilities
by
this
time
however
the
pain
and
the
immediate
terror
had
so
far
subsided
that
his
father
knew
he
could
now
control
himself
and
rollo
knew
that
he
must
obey
he
accordingly
stopped
crying
aloud
and
tried
to
listen
to
his
father
said
his
father
pity
you
very
much
i
warned
you
against
this
bad
company
and
now
i
perceive
you
have
got
into
some
difficulty
with
them
but
i
can
not
hear
your
story
about
it
till
we
get
home
it
is
your
own
fault
that
has
brought
you
into
trouble
and
now
you
must
not
extend
your
trouble
over
all
our
party
and
spoil
our
happiness
as
you
have
your
own
i
must
go
and
put
you
by
yourself
until
you
get
entirely
composed
and
pleasant
and
then
you
may
join
us
father
said
rollo
beginning
to
cry
afresh
at
the
thoughts
of
the
treatment
of
him
came
up
to
me
rollo
said
his
father
still
you
can
not
tell
the
story
intelligibly
now
and
if
you
could
i
should
not
be
willing
to
listen
to
it
you
must
not
say
any
thing
about
it
unless
you
are
questioned
until
we
get
by
this
time
they
came
up
pretty
near
the
place
where
the
rest
of
the
party
were
but
his
father
did
not
take
him
there
he
turned
aside
and
putting
rollo
down
he
led
him
along
to
a
smooth
log
which
lay
among
some
old
trees
close
by
and
told
him
to
sit
there
until
he
was
entirely
composed
and
pleasant
again
and
then
to
come
to
him
or
to
go
to
picking
berries
again
just
as
he
pleased
rollo
sat
on
the
log
for
some
time
with
his
empty
basket
by
his
side
mourning
over
his
sorrows
lucy
came
to
him
and
endeavored
to
console
him
she
begged
him
not
to
cry
and
she
poured
out
half
of
her
own
berries
into
his
basket
and
told
him
that
they
could
soon
fill
it
full
again
if
he
would
come
with
her
to
a
good
thick
place
she
had
found
rollo
became
gradually
quiet
and
composed
and
walked
along
with
lucy
lucy
had
indeed
found
a
place
where
the
berries
were
very
thick
and
large
and
rollo
determined
to
be
as
industrious
as
possible
they
worked
away
very
busily
for
half
an
hour
and
rollo
gradually
recovered
his
spirits
his
mother
watched
him
from
time
to
time
and
when
she
saw
that
he
was
again
she
said
to
his
father
seems
to
be
picking
his
berries
very
pleasantly
i
rather
think
he
is
sorry
for
his
i
see
he
is
getting
again
but
i
am
afraid
he
is
not
truly
penitent
it
is
easier
a
sin
than
to
be
sorry
for
it
it
is
very
easy
however
for
us
to
can
we
ascertain
asked
his
mother
if
you
should
go
and
ask
him
about
it
if
he
is
really
penitent
he
will
be
troubled
most
to
think
of
his
disobedience
in
going
into
the
bad
company
but
if
he
is
not
penitent
he
will
not
think
of
that
but
only
go
to
scolding
about
the
bad
is
true
said
she
have
a
great
mind
to
go
and
try
father
thought
it
would
be
a
good
plan
and
she
accordingly
walked
along
towards
rollo
slowly
gathering
berries
as
she
went
rollo
saw
her
coming
and
said
is
mother
lucy
let
us
go
and
give
her
our
so
saying
he
carried
his
basket
up
to
her
very
pleasantly
and
said
mother
see
here
are
all
these
berries
i
have
been
picking
for
said
she
you
pick
all
these
for
me
said
he
all
lucy
gave
me
lucy
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
and
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
rollo
are
pleasant
again
i
am
sorry
you
went
and
got
into
difficulty
with
those
came
and
took
away
my
berries
said
he
struck
great
ugly
the
feelings
of
vexation
and
anger
against
the
bad
boys
began
to
rise
again
in
mind
the
moment
he
began
to
talk
about
them
and
he
was
just
going
to
cry
his
mother
stopped
him
saying
need
not
tell
me
about
him
any
more
i
see
how
it
what
is
said
rollo
it
is
about
your
being
sorry
your
father
told
me
that
if
you
were
truly
penitent
for
what
happened
about
those
boys
i
should
find
you
when
i
came
to
talk
with
you
about
it
grieved
for
fault
and
if
you
were
not
penitent
you
would
only
be
angry
at
i
see
which
it
rollo
was
silent
a
moment
he
felt
the
truth
and
justice
of
the
distinction
but
like
all
boys
who
are
not
sorry
for
the
wrong
they
have
done
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
try
to
justify
himself
by
throwing
the
blame
on
others
so
he
began
to
tell
her
something
more
about
cross
old
jim
but
she
interrupted
him
and
told
him
she
did
not
wish
to
hear
any
thing
about
that
old
he
was
not
her
boy
she
said
and
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
or
his
faults
she
then
went
to
talking
about
other
things
and
helped
rollo
begin
to
fill
his
basket
again
he
showed
her
where
the
berries
were
thickest
and
led
her
round
behind
a
rock
to
show
her
a
beautiful
wild
flower
that
he
had
found
he
said
he
did
not
bring
it
to
her
for
his
father
had
told
him
not
to
touch
any
flowers
or
berries
that
they
did
not
know
for
fear
they
might
be
poisonous
after
a
little
while
mother
left
him
and
lucy
together
and
went
back
lo
where
his
father
and
uncle
were
said
they
did
you
find
rollo
but
not
said
she
lucy
and
rollo
went
on
gathering
berries
some
time
after
mother
left
him
in
silence
rollo
felt
rather
unhappy
but
he
was
not
subdued
his
heart
was
still
proud
and
unhumbled
and
after
a
time
he
said
to
lucy
seems
to
me
very
strange
that
my
mother
does
not
think
those
boys
were
to
blame
any
for
doing
does
think
they
were
to
blame
rollo
i
she
does
not
she
will
not
hear
me
say
any
thing
about
lucy
did
not
answer
because
she
knew
it
would
do
no
good
to
dispute
with
rollo
while
he
was
so
unreasonable
rollo
ought
to
have
been
willing
to
have
seen
his
fault
and
to
have
felt
truly
sorry
for
it
but
he
was
not
and
so
lucy
thought
it
was
better
not
to
talk
with
him
about
it
at
all
if
he
had
been
truly
sorry
and
had
gone
and
told
his
father
so
and
asked
his
forgiveness
he
would
have
been
happy
again
but
as
it
was
he
was
not
happy
the
recollection
of
his
disobedience
and
sin
would
remain
in
his
mind
and
though
he
tried
to
talk
and
laugh
and
play
as
usual
his
mind
was
not
much
at
ease
in
fact
he
was
secretly
glad
when
the
time
arrived
for
going
home
the
party
all
gathered
together
on
a
smooth
piece
of
ground
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
to
make
their
arrangements
for
going
down
the
mountain
they
put
their
baskets
filled
beautifully
with
blueberries
together
on
the
grass
while
they
sat
on
the
stones
and
logs
around
to
rest
a
little
before
walking
down
then
father
arranged
the
order
of
march
jonas
was
to
go
first
with
two
of
the
heaviest
baskets
of
berries
next
came
lucy
with
her
little
basket
about
two
thirds
full
and
with
leaves
and
some
beautiful
pieces
of
moss
she
had
found
put
in
upon
the
top
then
came
mother
leaning
on
his
arm
his
uncle
had
a
basket
of
berries
in
his
other
hand
finally
rollo
and
his
father
walked
together
behind
with
each
a
basket
in
his
hand
thus
they
walked
along
down
the
steep
path
until
they
began
to
enter
the
bushes
father
had
made
this
arrangement
so
that
he
might
have
an
opportunity
to
talk
with
him
about
the
difficulty
with
the
boys
for
he
thought
on
the
whole
it
would
be
better
to
talk
with
him
now
than
to
wait
till
they
got
home
after
they
had
walked
along
a
little
way
father
asked
him
whether
he
had
a
good
time
blueberrying
yes
sir
said
rollo
you
seen
any
thing
more
of
those
boys
mother
went
to
talk
with
you
and
said
you
did
not
seem
very
sorry
for
your
father
said
rollo
did
not
do
any
thing
to
the
boys
at
all
it
was
all
their
fault
suppose
you
did
do
any
thing
wrong
towards
but
you
committed
a
great
fault
in
respect
to
fault
said
rollo
father
how
you
did
not
tell
me
to
stay
close
by
is
a
boy
guilty
of
disobedience
only
when
he
does
what
his
father
forbids
in
words
suppose
so
said
rollo
is
disobedience
asked
his
father
it
is
doing
what
you
tell
me
not
to
do
is
it
not
is
not
a
sufficient
definition
of
it
for
suppose
you
were
out
there
in
the
bushes
and
i
was
to
beckon
you
to
come
here
and
you
should
not
come
would
not
that
be
disobedience
yes
yet
i
should
not
you
to
so
if
i
were
to
shake
my
head
at
you
when
you
were
doing
any
thing
wrong
and
you
wore
to
continue
doing
it
that
would
be
rollo
admitted
that
it
would
that
it
is
not
necessary
that
i
should
tell
you
what
my
wishes
are
if
i
express
them
in
any
way
so
that
you
plainly
understand
it
that
is
enough
the
most
important
orders
that
are
given
by
men
are
often
given
without
any
father
at
sea
sometimes
where
there
is
a
great
fleet
of
ships
and
the
admiral
who
commands
them
all
is
in
one
of
them
now
if
he
wants
all
the
fleet
to
sail
in
any
way
or
if
he
wishes
to
have
some
one
vessel
come
near
to
his
or
go
back
home
or
go
away
to
any
other
part
of
the
world
or
if
he
wants
any
particular
person
in
the
fleet
to
come
on
board
his
vessel
does
not
send
an
order
in
he
only
hoists
flags
of
a
particular
kind
upon
the
masts
of
his
vessel
and
they
all
obey
them
suppose
continued
he
of
the
ships
did
not
sail
as
he
wished
and
when
he
called
the
captain
to
account
for
it
he
should
say
that
he
was
not
guilty
of
disobedience
because
he
did
not
him
to
sail
rollo
laughed
and
said
he
thought
that
would
not
be
a
very
good
excuse
it
is
just
such
an
excuse
as
yours
i
did
not
positively
command
you
not
to
go
near
the
boys
or
not
to
have
any
conversation
with
them
at
all
though
i
expressed
my
wish
that
you
would
not
so
that
you
could
not
help
understanding
rollo
could
not
deny
that
this
was
so
that
is
not
the
only
case
of
disobedience
for
you
did
one
thing
which
was
contrary
to
express
command
in
rollo
looked
concerned
and
said
he
was
sure
he
did
not
know
it
told
you
not
to
go
out
of
my
but
father
said
rollo
eagerly
in
reply
am
sure
i
did
not
mean
to
i
was
picking
berries
so
busy
i
did
not
observe
where
i
know
you
were
and
that
was
the
disobedience
for
when
i
command
you
to
keep
in
sight
of
me
that
means
that
you
must
take
good
care
that
you
mind
where
you
are
suppose
i
were
to
tell
jonas
that
he
might
go
and
take
a
walk
but
that
he
must
be
sure
to
come
back
in
half
an
hour
and
he
should
go
and
pay
no
attention
to
the
time
and
so
not
come
back
until
three
quarters
of
an
hour
would
that
be
obedience
sir
but
it
would
not
be
so
bad
as
it
would
be
if
he
should
stay
away
when
he
that
the
time
was
it
would
not
be
so
wilful
an
act
of
disobedience
but
it
would
be
disobedience
notwithstanding
you
see
rollo
he
continued
i
tell
you
or
any
boy
to
come
back
in
half
an
hour
there
are
two
things
implied
in
the
that
you
should
the
and
secondly
that
you
should
come
back
when
the
time
is
out
now
you
may
disobey
the
command
by
neglecting
either
of
sir
said
rollo
see
we
may
but
i
did
not
think
of
it
i
presume
you
did
not
said
his
father
i
want
you
to
understand
it
and
remember
it
after
this
forever
you
have
disobeyed
in
two
ways
in
which
boys
are
very
apt
to
disobey
when
they
do
not
mean
to
do
it
wilfully
i
will
tell
you
what
the
principles
are
again
so
that
you
can
remember
and
tell
me
when
i
ask
you
boys
must
take
care
to
comply
with
their
directions
if
they
are
expressed
in
any
way
whatsoever
and
when
directed
to
do
any
thing
in
a
particular
time
or
way
they
must
see
to
it
themselves
that
they
and
in
mind
the
which
they
are
required
to
attend
rollo
said
he
would
try
to
remember
it
and
as
he
seemed
attentive
and
docile
his
father
did
not
talk
with
him
any
more
about
his
fault
at
that
time
besides
they
came
now
to
some
very
rough
places
in
the
path
and
father
had
to
lift
lucy
over
them
lucy
spilled
some
of
her
berries
in
one
place
and
rollo
was
going
to
help
her
pick
them
up
but
jonas
said
they
had
better
leave
them
for
the
birds
and
walk
on
we
will
lucy
said
rollo
i
rather
think
that
mosette
is
hungry
by
this
said
jonas
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
mosette
put
him
in
a
cage
and
bring
him
up
tame
said
rollo
mean
to
teach
him
to
eat
out
of
my
hand
i
shall
treat
him
very
kindly
though
he
is
my
little
would
give
him
the
liberty
of
the
yard
if
i
were
you
said
some
one
behind
laughing
rollo
looked
round
it
was
his
uncle
george
walking
close
behind
him
is
the
liberty
of
the
yard
said
rollo
when
intend
to
treat
a
prisoner
kindly
they
leave
the
prison
door
open
and
let
him
walk
about
the
yard
and
this
is
called
letting
him
have
the
liberty
of
the
yard
and
sometimes
they
let
them
go
over
half
the
you
think
i
had
better
do
so
with
mosette
said
rollo
said
his
uncle
george
his
cage
open
and
let
him
go
where
he
he
would
fly
entirely
away
said
rollo
not
if
you
should
feed
him
well
and
treat
him
very
kindly
he
might
like
his
cage
better
than
any
shall
treat
him
as
kindly
as
i
can
said
rollo
think
jonas
said
if
he
had
found
him
he
should
have
set
him
up
upon
the
fence
for
a
mark
to
fire
stones
at
said
so
said
jonas
did
jim
know
any
thing
about
it
told
him
said
rollo
did
you
tell
him
for
because
said
rollo
were
talking
and
i
told
hope
you
did
not
tell
him
where
we
hid
mosette
behind
the
said
rollo
believe
i
i
am
afraid
you
will
never
see
poor
mosette
again
said
jonas
said
rollo
think
that
he
would
go
and
get
know
said
jonas
he
would
do
but
i
should
not
have
wanted
to
tell
such
a
boy
any
thing
about
rollo
began
to
be
alarmed
he
went
back
to
his
father
and
asked
him
to
let
him
and
jonas
go
on
before
the
rest
to
see
if
their
bird
was
safe
his
father
told
him
he
might
go
said
he
am
afraid
you
have
lost
your
bird
when
a
boy
allows
himself
to
get
into
bad
company
he
does
not
know
how
many
troubles
he
plunges
himself
rollo
and
jonas
ran
on
and
soon
disappeared
among
the
trees
rollo
found
it
hard
to
keep
up
as
the
road
was
not
very
smooth
though
they
had
got
down
the
steepest
part
of
the
mountain
jonas
kept
hold
of
hand
and
went
on
running
and
walking
alternately
until
they
got
down
to
the
end
of
the
trees
and
bushes
and
then
they
came
out
in
sight
of
the
place
where
the
horses
were
tied
it
was
fortunate
for
poor
mosette
and
for
rollo
too
that
they
did
thus
run
on
before
for
it
happened
that
jim
and
the
boys
with
him
had
come
down
the
mountain
by
another
road
and
were
just
going
up
to
the
place
as
jonas
and
rollo
came
out
of
the
woods
they
are
said
jonas
stay
here
i
must
run
and
he
let
go
of
hand
sprang
forward
and
ran
with
all
his
might
rollo
tried
to
follow
but
soon
stopped
and
looked
on
jim
and
his
boys
did
not
see
jonas
coming
and
they
went
to
work
looking
around
the
bushes
and
stones
after
mosette
in
a
few
minutes
one
smaller
boy
came
out
from
the
bushes
close
by
the
place
where
rollo
recollected
the
nest
was
hid
with
something
in
his
hand
and
rollo
could
distinctly
hear
him
calling
out
he
is
have
got
him
just
that
moment
jonas
came
running
up
among
the
boys
calling
out
that
bird
alone
that
bird
alone
the
boys
terrified
at
this
unexpected
onset
started
and
ran
in
every
direction
the
boy
who
had
the
nest
dropped
it
upon
the
ground
and
dodged
back
into
the
bushes
jonas
took
it
up
carefully
put
little
mosette
who
had
fallen
out
back
in
the
nest
and
walked
out
into
the
road
to
meet
rollo
who
was
coming
down
as
fast
as
he
could
come
on
the
other
side
they
saw
jim
and
his
comrades
no
more
and
rollo
said
he
believed
he
should
never
again
want
to
have
any
thing
to
do
with
bad
boys
