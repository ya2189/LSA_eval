this
edition
first
published
the
text
follows
that
of
the
definitive
edition
i
got
him
for
life
i
said
to
myself
that
evening
on
my
way
back
to
the
station
but
later
on
alone
in
the
compartment
from
wimbledon
to
waterloo
before
the
glory
of
the
district
railway
i
amended
this
declaration
in
the
light
of
the
sense
that
my
friends
would
probably
after
all
not
enjoy
a
monopoly
of
saltram
i
pretend
to
have
taken
his
vast
measure
on
that
first
occasion
but
i
think
i
had
achieved
a
glimpse
of
what
the
privilege
of
his
acquaintance
might
mean
for
many
persons
in
the
way
of
charges
accepted
he
had
been
a
great
experience
and
it
was
this
perhaps
that
had
put
me
into
the
frame
of
foreseeing
how
we
should
all
sooner
or
later
have
the
honour
of
dealing
with
him
as
a
whole
whatever
impression
i
then
received
of
the
amount
of
this
total
i
had
a
full
enough
vision
of
the
patience
of
the
mulvilles
he
was
to
stay
all
the
winter
adelaide
dropped
it
in
a
tone
that
drew
the
sting
from
the
inevitable
emphasis
these
excellent
people
might
indeed
have
been
content
to
give
the
circle
of
hospitality
a
diameter
of
six
months
but
if
they
say
he
was
to
stay
all
summer
as
well
it
was
only
because
this
was
more
than
they
ventured
to
hope
i
remember
that
at
dinner
that
evening
he
wore
slippers
new
and
predominantly
purple
of
some
queer
but
the
mulvilles
were
still
in
the
stage
of
supposing
that
he
might
be
snatched
from
them
by
higher
bidders
at
a
later
time
they
grew
poor
dears
to
fear
no
snatching
but
theirs
was
a
fidelity
which
needed
no
help
from
competition
to
make
them
proud
wonderful
indeed
as
when
all
was
said
you
inevitably
pronounced
frank
saltram
it
was
not
to
be
overlooked
that
the
kent
mulvilles
were
in
their
way
still
more
extraordinary
as
striking
an
instance
as
could
easily
be
encountered
of
the
familiar
truth
that
remarkable
men
find
remarkable
conveniences
they
had
sent
for
me
from
wimbledon
to
come
out
and
dine
and
there
had
been
an
implication
in
by
her
notes
alone
she
might
have
been
thought
it
was
a
case
in
which
something
momentous
was
to
be
determined
or
done
i
had
never
known
them
not
be
in
a
about
somebody
and
i
dare
say
i
tried
to
be
droll
on
this
point
in
accepting
their
invitation
on
finding
myself
in
the
presence
of
their
latest
discovery
i
had
not
at
first
felt
irreverence
thank
heaven
i
have
never
been
absolutely
deprived
of
that
alternative
in
company
i
saw
hasten
to
declare
compared
to
this
specimen
their
other
phoenixes
had
been
birds
of
inconsiderable
feather
and
i
afterwards
took
credit
to
myself
for
not
having
even
in
primal
bewilderments
made
a
mistake
about
the
essence
of
the
man
he
had
an
incomparable
gift
i
never
was
blind
to
dazzles
me
still
it
dazzles
me
perhaps
even
more
in
remembrance
than
in
fact
for
not
unaware
that
for
so
rare
a
subject
the
imagination
goes
to
some
expense
inserting
a
jewel
here
and
there
or
giving
a
twist
to
a
plume
how
the
art
of
portraiture
would
rejoice
in
this
figure
if
the
art
of
portraiture
had
only
the
canvas
nature
in
truth
had
largely
rounded
it
and
if
memory
hovering
about
it
sometimes
holds
her
breath
this
is
because
the
voice
that
comes
back
was
really
golden
though
the
great
man
was
an
inmate
and
dress
he
kept
dinner
on
this
occasion
waiting
and
the
first
words
he
uttered
on
coming
into
the
room
were
an
elated
announcement
to
mulville
that
he
had
found
out
something
not
catching
the
allusion
and
gaping
doubtless
a
little
at
his
face
i
privately
asked
adelaide
what
he
had
found
out
i
shall
never
forget
the
look
she
gave
me
as
she
replied
she
really
believed
it
at
that
moment
at
any
rate
he
had
found
out
that
the
mercy
of
the
mulvilles
was
infinite
he
had
previously
of
course
discovered
as
i
had
myself
for
that
matter
that
their
dinners
were
soign√©s
let
me
not
indeed
in
saying
this
neglect
to
declare
that
i
shall
falsify
my
counterfeit
if
i
seem
to
hint
that
there
was
in
his
nature
any
ounce
of
calculation
he
took
whatever
came
but
he
never
plotted
for
it
and
no
man
who
was
so
much
of
an
absorbent
can
ever
have
been
so
little
of
a
parasite
he
had
a
system
of
the
universe
but
he
had
no
system
of
was
quite
he
had
fine
gross
easy
senses
but
it
was
not
his
appetite
that
wrought
confusion
if
he
had
loved
us
for
our
dinners
we
could
have
paid
with
our
dinners
and
it
would
have
been
a
great
economy
of
finer
matter
i
make
free
in
these
connexions
with
the
plural
possessive
because
if
i
was
never
able
to
do
what
the
mulvilles
did
and
people
with
still
bigger
houses
and
simpler
charities
i
met
first
and
last
every
demand
of
reflexion
of
perhaps
those
of
gratitude
and
of
resentment
no
one
i
think
paid
the
tribute
of
giving
him
up
so
often
and
if
rendering
honour
to
borrow
wisdom
a
right
to
talk
of
my
sacrifices
he
yielded
lessons
as
the
sea
yields
lived
for
a
while
on
this
diet
sometimes
it
almost
appeared
to
me
that
his
massive
monstrous
failure
after
all
it
been
designed
for
my
private
recreation
he
fairly
pampered
my
curiosity
but
the
history
of
that
experience
would
take
me
too
far
this
is
not
the
large
canvas
i
just
now
spoke
of
and
i
have
approached
him
with
my
present
hand
had
it
been
a
question
of
all
the
features
frank
features
for
artistic
purposes
are
verily
the
anecdotes
that
are
to
be
gathered
their
name
is
legion
and
this
is
only
one
of
which
the
interest
is
that
it
concerns
even
more
closely
several
other
persons
such
episodes
as
one
looks
back
are
the
little
dramas
that
made
up
the
innumerable
facets
of
the
big
is
yet
to
be
reported
ii
it
is
furthermore
remarkable
that
though
the
two
stories
are
own
as
it
were
and
this
equally
began
in
a
manner
the
first
night
of
my
acquaintance
with
frank
saltram
the
night
i
came
back
from
wimbledon
so
agitated
with
a
new
sense
of
life
that
in
london
for
the
very
thrill
of
it
i
could
only
walk
home
walking
and
swinging
my
stick
i
overtook
at
buckingham
gate
george
gravener
and
george
story
may
be
said
to
have
begun
with
my
making
him
as
our
paths
lay
together
come
home
with
me
for
a
talk
i
duly
remember
let
me
parenthesise
that
it
was
still
more
that
of
another
person
and
also
that
several
years
were
to
elapse
before
it
was
to
extend
to
a
second
chapter
i
had
much
to
say
to
him
none
the
less
about
my
visit
to
the
mulvilles
whom
he
more
indifferently
knew
and
i
was
at
any
rate
so
amusing
that
for
long
afterwards
he
never
encountered
me
without
asking
for
news
of
the
old
man
of
the
sea
i
said
saltram
was
old
and
it
was
to
be
seen
that
he
was
of
an
age
to
outweather
george
gravener
i
had
at
that
time
a
lodging
in
ebury
street
and
gravener
was
staying
at
his
empty
house
in
eaton
square
at
cambridge
five
years
before
even
in
our
devastating
set
his
intellectual
power
had
seemed
to
me
almost
awful
some
one
had
once
asked
me
privately
with
blanched
cheeks
what
it
was
then
that
after
all
such
a
mind
as
that
left
standing
leaves
itself
i
could
recollect
devoutly
replying
i
could
smile
at
present
for
this
remembrance
since
before
we
got
to
ebury
street
i
was
struck
with
the
fact
that
save
in
the
sense
of
being
well
set
up
on
his
legs
george
gravener
had
actually
ceased
to
tower
the
universe
he
laid
low
had
somehow
bloomed
usual
eminences
were
visible
i
wondered
whether
he
had
lost
his
humour
or
only
dreadful
thought
had
never
had
even
when
i
had
fancied
him
most
aristophanesque
what
was
the
need
of
appealing
to
laughter
however
i
could
enviously
enquire
where
you
might
appeal
so
confidently
to
measurement
queer
figure
his
thick
nose
and
hanging
lip
were
fresh
to
me
in
the
light
of
my
old
fine
cold
symmetry
they
presented
mere
success
in
amusing
as
the
refuge
of
conscious
ugliness
already
at
hungry
gravener
looked
as
blank
and
parliamentary
as
if
he
were
fifty
and
popular
in
my
scrap
of
a
had
a
eye
for
its
futile
conveniences
but
never
a
sounded
frank
saltram
in
his
ears
a
circumstance
i
mention
in
order
to
note
that
even
then
i
was
surprised
at
his
impatience
of
my
enlivenment
as
he
had
never
before
heard
of
the
personage
it
took
indeed
the
form
of
impatience
of
the
preposterous
mulvilles
his
relation
to
whom
like
mine
had
had
its
origin
in
an
early
a
childish
intimacy
with
the
young
adelaide
the
fruit
of
multiplied
ties
in
the
previous
generation
when
she
married
kent
mulville
who
was
older
than
gravener
and
i
and
much
more
amiable
i
gained
a
friend
but
gravener
practically
lost
one
we
reacted
in
different
ways
from
the
form
taken
by
what
he
called
their
deplorable
social
form
the
term
was
also
his
of
nasty
gush
i
may
have
held
in
my
that
the
good
people
at
wimbledon
were
beautiful
fools
but
when
he
sniffed
at
them
i
help
taking
the
opposite
line
for
i
already
felt
that
even
should
we
happen
to
agree
it
would
always
be
for
reasons
that
differed
it
came
home
to
me
that
he
was
admirably
british
as
without
so
much
as
a
sociable
sneer
at
my
bookbinder
he
turned
away
from
the
serried
rows
of
my
little
french
library
course
never
seen
the
fellow
but
clear
enough
a
is
just
what
it
i
replied
it
only
were
that
ejaculation
on
my
part
must
have
been
the
beginning
of
what
was
to
be
later
a
long
ache
for
final
frivolous
rest
gravener
was
profound
enough
to
remark
after
a
moment
that
in
the
first
place
he
be
anything
but
a
dissenter
and
when
i
answered
that
the
very
note
of
his
fascination
was
his
extraordinary
speculative
breadth
my
friend
retorted
that
there
was
no
cad
like
your
cultivated
cad
and
that
i
might
depend
upon
i
had
had
the
levity
not
already
to
have
my
shining
light
proceeded
a
generation
back
from
a
methodist
cheesemonger
i
confess
i
was
struck
with
his
insistence
and
i
said
after
reflexion
may
admit
it
may
be
but
why
on
earth
are
you
so
sure
the
question
mainly
to
lay
him
the
trap
of
saying
that
it
was
because
the
poor
man
dress
for
dinner
he
took
an
instant
to
circumvent
my
trap
and
come
blandly
out
the
other
side
the
kent
mulvilles
have
invented
him
an
infallible
hand
for
frauds
all
their
geese
are
swans
they
were
born
to
be
duped
they
like
it
they
cry
for
it
they
know
anything
from
anything
and
they
disgust
perhaps
christian
his
vehemence
was
doubtless
an
accident
but
it
might
have
been
a
strange
foreknowledge
i
forget
what
protest
i
dropped
it
was
at
any
rate
something
that
led
him
to
go
on
after
a
moment
only
ask
one
perfectly
simple
is
a
man
in
a
given
case
a
real
gentleman
real
gentleman
my
dear
so
soon
said
so
soon
when
he
if
got
hold
of
one
this
time
he
must
be
a
great
rascal
might
feel
injured
i
answered
i
reflect
that
they
rave
about
be
too
sure
grant
that
a
gentleman
gravener
presently
added
admit
that
a
know
which
to
admire
most
your
logic
or
your
my
friend
coloured
at
this
but
he
change
the
subject
did
they
pick
him
up
think
they
were
struck
with
something
he
had
can
fancy
the
dreary
thing
believe
they
found
out
he
had
all
sorts
of
worries
and
of
course
to
be
endured
so
they
jumped
at
the
privilege
of
paying
his
debts
i
professed
that
i
knew
nothing
about
his
debts
and
i
reminded
my
visitor
that
though
the
dear
mulvilles
were
angels
they
were
neither
idiots
nor
millionaires
what
they
mainly
aimed
at
was
reuniting
saltram
to
his
wife
was
expecting
to
hear
he
has
basely
abandoned
her
gravener
went
on
at
this
too
glad
you
disappoint
i
tried
to
recall
exactly
what
mulville
had
told
me
leave
she
who
has
left
him
to
us
gravener
asked
thanks
i
decline
to
take
hear
more
about
him
in
spite
of
yourself
i
no
i
really
resist
the
impression
that
a
big
i
was
already
my
shame
perhaps
be
it
the
tone
my
old
friend
least
liked
doubtless
only
a
trifle
he
returned
you
happened
to
mention
what
his
to
rest
on
what
i
began
by
boring
you
extraordinary
exhibited
in
his
writings
in
his
writings
but
certainly
in
his
talk
which
is
far
and
away
the
richest
i
ever
listened
it
all
about
dear
fellow
ask
me
about
everything
i
pursued
reminding
myself
of
poor
adelaide
his
ideas
of
things
i
then
more
charitably
added
must
have
heard
him
to
know
what
i
unlike
anything
that
ever
was
i
coloured
i
admit
i
overcharged
a
little
for
such
a
picture
was
an
anticipation
of
later
development
and
still
more
of
my
fuller
acquaintance
with
him
however
i
really
expressed
a
little
lyrically
perhaps
my
actual
imagination
of
him
when
i
proceeded
to
declare
that
in
a
cloud
of
tradition
of
legend
he
might
very
well
go
down
to
posterity
as
the
greatest
of
all
great
talkers
before
we
parted
george
gravener
had
wondered
why
such
a
row
should
be
made
about
a
chatterbox
the
more
and
why
he
should
be
pampered
and
pensioned
the
greater
the
the
greater
the
calamity
out
of
proportion
to
everything
else
on
earth
had
come
to
be
this
wagging
of
the
tongue
we
were
drenched
with
wretched
age
was
dying
of
it
i
differed
from
him
here
sincerely
only
going
so
far
as
to
concede
and
gladly
that
we
were
drenched
with
sound
it
was
not
however
the
mere
speakers
who
were
killing
was
the
mere
stammerers
fine
talk
was
as
rare
as
it
was
gift
of
the
gods
themselves
the
one
starry
spangle
on
the
ragged
cloak
of
humanity
how
many
men
were
there
who
rose
to
this
privilege
of
how
many
masters
of
conversation
could
he
boast
the
acquaintance
dying
of
talk
we
were
dying
of
the
lack
of
it
bad
writing
talk
as
many
people
seemed
to
think
and
even
good
always
to
be
compared
to
it
from
the
best
talk
indeed
the
best
writing
had
something
to
learn
i
fancifully
added
that
we
too
should
peradventure
be
gilded
by
the
legend
should
be
pointed
at
for
having
listened
for
having
actually
heard
gravener
who
had
glanced
at
his
watch
and
discovered
it
was
midnight
found
to
all
this
a
retort
beautifully
characteristic
of
him
one
little
fact
to
be
borne
in
mind
in
the
presence
equally
of
the
best
talk
and
of
the
he
looked
in
saying
this
as
if
he
meant
great
things
and
i
was
sure
he
could
only
mean
once
more
that
neither
of
them
mattered
if
a
man
a
real
gentleman
perhaps
it
was
what
he
did
mean
he
deprived
me
however
of
the
exultation
of
being
right
by
putting
the
truth
in
a
slightly
different
way
only
thing
that
really
counts
for
estimate
of
a
person
is
his
he
had
his
watch
still
in
his
palm
and
i
reproached
him
with
unfair
play
in
having
ascertained
beforehand
that
it
was
now
the
hour
at
which
i
always
gave
in
my
pleasantry
so
far
failed
to
mollify
him
that
he
promptly
added
that
to
the
rule
he
had
just
enunciated
there
was
absolutely
no
exception
whatever
me
then
to
try
to
be
good
at
any
price
i
laughed
as
i
went
with
him
to
the
door
declare
i
will
be
if
i
have
to
be
horrible
iii
if
that
first
night
was
one
of
the
liveliest
or
at
any
rate
was
the
freshest
of
my
exaltations
there
was
another
four
years
later
that
was
one
of
my
great
discomposures
repetition
i
well
knew
by
this
time
was
the
secret
of
power
to
alienate
and
of
course
one
would
never
have
seen
him
at
his
finest
if
one
seen
him
in
his
remorses
they
set
in
mainly
at
this
season
and
were
magnificent
elemental
orchestral
i
was
quite
aware
that
one
of
these
atmospheric
disturbances
was
now
due
but
none
the
less
in
our
arduous
attempt
to
set
him
on
his
feet
as
a
lecturer
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
that
two
failures
were
a
large
order
as
we
said
for
a
short
course
of
five
this
was
the
second
time
and
it
was
past
nine
the
audience
a
muster
unprecedented
and
really
encouraging
had
fortunately
the
attitude
of
blandness
that
might
have
been
looked
for
in
persons
whom
the
promise
of
if
not
mistaken
an
analysis
of
primary
ideas
had
drawn
to
the
neighbourhood
of
upper
baker
street
there
was
in
those
days
in
that
region
a
petty
to
be
secured
on
terms
as
moderate
as
the
funds
left
at
our
disposal
by
the
irrepressible
question
of
the
maintenance
of
five
small
include
the
one
large
one
by
the
time
the
saltrams
of
different
sizes
were
all
maintained
we
had
pretty
well
poured
out
the
oil
that
might
have
lubricated
the
machinery
for
enabling
the
most
original
of
men
to
appear
to
maintain
them
it
was
i
the
other
time
who
had
been
forced
into
the
breach
standing
up
there
for
an
odious
lamplit
moment
to
explain
to
half
a
dozen
thin
benches
where
earnest
brows
were
virtuously
void
of
anything
so
cynical
as
a
suspicion
that
we
so
much
as
put
a
finger
on
saltram
there
was
nothing
to
plead
but
that
our
scouts
had
been
out
from
the
early
hours
and
that
we
were
afraid
that
on
one
of
his
walks
took
one
for
meditation
whenever
he
was
to
address
such
a
accident
had
disabled
or
delayed
him
the
meditative
walks
were
a
fiction
for
he
never
that
any
one
could
discover
prepared
anything
but
a
magnificent
prospectus
hence
his
circulars
and
programmes
of
which
i
possess
an
almost
complete
collection
are
the
solemn
ghosts
of
generations
never
born
i
put
the
case
as
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
best
but
i
admit
i
had
been
angry
and
kent
mulville
was
shocked
at
my
want
of
public
optimism
this
time
therefore
i
left
the
excuses
to
his
more
practised
patience
only
relieving
myself
in
response
to
a
direct
appeal
from
a
young
lady
next
whom
in
the
hall
i
found
myself
sitting
my
position
was
an
accident
but
if
it
had
been
calculated
the
reason
would
scarce
have
eluded
an
observer
of
the
fact
that
no
one
else
in
the
room
had
an
approach
to
an
appearance
our
was
deplorably
limp
this
visitor
was
the
only
person
who
looked
at
her
ease
who
had
come
a
little
in
the
spirit
of
adventure
she
seemed
to
carry
amusement
in
her
handsome
young
head
and
her
presence
spoke
a
little
mystifyingly
of
a
sudden
extension
of
sphere
of
influence
he
was
doing
better
than
we
hoped
and
he
had
chosen
such
an
occasion
of
all
occasions
to
succumb
to
heaven
knew
which
of
his
fond
infirmities
the
young
lady
produced
an
impression
of
auburn
hair
and
black
velvet
and
had
on
her
other
hand
a
companion
of
obscurer
type
presumably
a
she
herself
might
perhaps
have
been
a
foreign
countess
and
before
she
addressed
me
i
had
beguiled
our
sorry
interval
by
finding
in
her
a
vague
recall
of
the
opening
of
some
novel
of
madame
sand
it
make
her
more
fathomable
to
pass
in
a
few
minutes
from
this
to
the
certitude
that
she
was
american
it
simply
engendered
depressing
reflexions
as
to
the
possible
check
to
contributions
from
boston
she
asked
me
if
as
a
person
apparently
more
initiated
i
would
recommend
further
waiting
and
i
answered
that
if
she
considered
i
was
on
my
honour
i
would
privately
deprecate
it
perhaps
she
at
any
rate
our
talk
took
a
turn
that
prolonged
it
till
she
became
aware
we
were
left
almost
alone
i
presently
ascertained
she
knew
saltram
and
this
explained
in
a
manner
the
miracle
the
brotherhood
of
the
friends
of
the
husband
was
as
nothing
to
the
brotherhood
or
perhaps
i
should
say
the
sisterhood
of
the
friends
of
the
wife
like
the
kent
mulvilles
i
belonged
to
both
fraternities
and
even
better
than
they
i
think
i
had
sounded
the
abyss
of
wrongs
she
bored
me
to
extinction
and
i
knew
but
too
well
how
she
had
bored
her
husband
but
there
were
those
who
stood
by
her
the
most
efficient
of
whom
were
indeed
the
handful
of
poor
backers
they
did
her
liberal
justice
whereas
her
mere
patrons
and
partisans
had
nothing
but
hatred
for
our
philosopher
bound
to
say
it
was
we
of
both
camps
as
it
had
always
done
most
for
her
i
thought
my
young
lady
looked
scarcely
knew
why
and
i
hoped
she
had
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket
i
soon
made
her
out
however
not
at
all
a
fine
was
but
a
generous
irresponsible
enquirer
she
had
come
to
england
to
see
her
aunt
and
it
was
at
her
she
had
met
the
dreary
lady
we
had
all
so
much
on
our
mind
i
saw
help
to
pass
the
time
when
she
observed
that
it
was
a
pity
this
lady
intrinsically
more
interesting
that
was
refreshing
for
it
was
an
article
of
faith
in
least
among
those
who
scorned
to
know
her
horrid
she
was
attractive
on
her
merits
she
was
in
truth
a
most
ordinary
person
as
saltram
himself
would
have
been
if
he
been
a
prodigy
the
question
of
vulgarity
had
no
application
to
him
but
it
was
a
measure
his
wife
kept
challenging
you
to
apply
i
hasten
to
add
that
the
consequences
of
your
doing
so
were
no
sufficient
reason
for
his
having
left
her
to
starve
seem
to
have
much
force
of
character
said
my
young
lady
at
which
i
laughed
out
so
loud
that
my
departing
friends
looked
back
at
me
over
their
shoulders
as
if
i
were
making
a
joke
of
their
discomfiture
my
joke
probably
cost
saltram
a
subscription
or
two
but
it
helped
me
on
with
my
interlocutress
says
he
drinks
like
a
fish
she
sociably
continued
yet
she
allows
that
his
wonderfully
it
was
amusing
to
converse
with
a
pretty
girl
who
could
talk
of
the
clearness
of
mind
i
expected
next
to
hear
she
had
been
assured
he
was
awfully
clever
i
tried
to
tell
had
it
almost
on
my
was
the
proper
way
to
regard
him
an
effort
attended
perhaps
more
than
ever
on
this
occasion
with
the
usual
effect
of
my
feeling
that
i
after
all
very
sure
of
it
she
had
come
out
of
high
had
wanted
to
learn
this
proper
way
for
herself
she
had
read
some
of
his
papers
and
understood
them
but
it
was
at
home
at
her
that
her
curiosity
had
been
mainly
by
his
remarkable
stories
of
his
want
of
virtue
suppose
they
ought
to
have
kept
me
away
my
companion
dropped
i
suppose
have
done
so
if
i
somehow
got
an
idea
that
fascinating
in
fact
saltram
herself
says
he
you
came
to
see
where
the
fascination
resides
well
seen
my
young
lady
raised
fine
eyebrows
you
mean
in
his
bad
faith
the
extraordinary
effects
of
it
his
possession
that
is
of
some
quality
or
other
that
condemns
us
in
advance
to
forgive
him
the
humiliation
as
i
may
call
it
to
which
he
has
subjected
humiliation
mine
for
instance
as
one
of
his
guarantors
before
you
as
the
purchaser
of
a
she
let
her
charming
gay
eyes
rest
on
me
look
humiliated
a
bit
and
if
you
did
i
should
let
you
off
disappointed
as
i
am
for
the
mysterious
quality
you
speak
of
is
just
the
quality
i
came
to
you
it
i
cried
then
do
you
get
at
it
you
suppose
i
added
his
wife
says
lovely
my
hilarity
may
have
struck
her
as
excessive
but
i
confess
it
broke
out
afresh
had
she
acted
only
in
obedience
to
this
singular
plea
so
characteristic
on
part
of
what
was
irritating
in
the
narrowness
of
that
point
of
view
saltram
i
explained
him
where
strongest
so
that
to
make
up
for
it
perhaps
she
overpraises
him
where
weak
not
assuredly
superficially
attractive
fat
featureless
save
for
his
great
his
great
eyes
said
my
young
lady
attentively
she
had
evidently
heard
all
about
his
great
beaux
yeux
for
which
alone
we
had
really
done
it
all
tragic
and
on
a
dangerous
coast
but
he
moves
badly
and
dresses
worse
and
altogether
anything
but
my
companion
who
appeared
to
reflect
on
this
after
a
moment
appealed
you
call
him
a
real
gentleman
i
started
slightly
at
the
question
for
i
had
a
sense
of
recognising
it
george
gravener
years
before
that
first
flushed
night
had
put
me
face
to
face
with
it
it
had
embarrassed
me
then
but
it
embarrass
me
now
for
i
had
lived
with
it
and
overcome
it
and
disposed
of
it
real
gentleman
emphatically
not
my
promptitude
surprised
her
a
little
but
i
quickly
felt
how
little
it
was
to
gravener
i
was
now
talking
you
say
that
because
do
you
call
it
in
england
humble
extraction
a
bit
his
father
was
a
country
and
his
mother
the
widow
of
a
sexton
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
say
it
simply
because
i
know
him
it
an
awful
drawback
mean
it
positively
fatal
to
what
not
to
his
magnificent
again
she
had
a
meditative
moment
is
his
magnificent
vitality
the
cause
of
his
vices
questions
are
formidable
but
glad
you
put
them
i
was
thinking
of
his
noble
intellect
his
vices
as
you
say
have
been
much
exaggerated
they
consist
mainly
after
all
in
one
comprehensive
want
of
will
want
of
recognise
his
obligations
the
contrary
he
recognises
them
with
effusion
especially
in
public
he
smiles
and
bows
and
beckons
across
the
street
to
them
but
when
they
pass
over
he
turns
away
and
he
speedily
loses
them
in
the
crowd
the
purely
in
the
least
social
so
he
leaves
all
his
belongings
to
other
people
to
take
care
of
he
accepts
favours
loans
with
nothing
more
deterrent
than
an
agony
of
shame
fortunately
a
little
faithful
band
and
we
do
what
we
i
held
my
tongue
about
the
natural
children
engendered
to
the
number
of
three
in
the
wantonness
of
his
youth
i
only
remarked
that
he
did
make
tremendous
ones
the
efforts
i
said
come
to
much
the
only
things
that
come
to
much
are
the
abandonments
the
how
much
do
they
come
to
right
to
put
it
as
if
we
had
a
big
bill
to
pay
but
as
told
you
before
your
questions
are
rather
terrible
they
come
these
mere
exercises
of
genius
to
a
great
sum
total
of
poetry
of
philosophy
a
mighty
mass
of
speculation
notation
quotation
the
genius
is
there
you
see
to
meet
the
surrender
but
no
genius
to
support
the
what
is
there
after
all
at
his
age
to
show
the
way
of
achievement
recognised
and
reputation
established
i
asked
if
you
will
there
much
since
his
writing
mostly
as
fine
certainly
as
showy
as
his
talk
moreover
of
his
work
are
merely
colossal
projects
and
announcements
frank
saltram
is
often
a
poor
business
i
went
on
endeavoured
have
observed
to
show
him
however
if
he
had
lectured
have
lectured
divinely
it
would
just
have
been
his
what
would
his
talk
just
have
been
i
was
conscious
of
some
ineffectiveness
as
well
perhaps
as
of
a
little
impatience
as
i
replied
exhibition
of
a
splendid
my
young
lady
looked
not
quite
satisfied
at
this
but
as
i
prepared
for
another
question
i
hastily
pursued
sight
of
a
great
suspended
swinging
lucid
lustrous
a
block
of
back
every
impression
of
life
and
every
possibility
of
thought
this
gave
her
something
to
turn
over
till
we
had
passed
out
to
the
dusky
porch
of
the
hall
in
front
of
which
the
lamps
of
a
quiet
brougham
were
almost
the
only
thing
treachery
extinguished
i
went
with
her
to
the
door
of
her
carriage
out
of
which
she
leaned
a
moment
after
she
had
thanked
me
and
taken
her
seat
her
smile
even
in
the
darkness
was
pretty
do
want
to
see
that
crystal
only
to
come
to
the
next
go
abroad
in
a
day
or
two
with
my
over
till
next
week
i
suggested
quite
worth
she
became
grave
unless
he
really
comes
at
which
the
brougham
started
off
carrying
her
away
too
fast
fortunately
for
my
manners
to
allow
me
to
exclaim
iv
saltram
made
a
great
affair
of
her
right
to
be
informed
where
her
husband
had
been
the
second
evening
he
failed
to
meet
his
audience
she
came
to
me
to
ascertain
but
i
satisfy
her
for
in
spite
of
my
ingenuity
i
remained
in
ignorance
it
till
much
later
that
i
found
this
had
not
been
the
case
with
kent
mulville
whose
hope
for
the
best
never
twirled
the
thumbs
of
him
more
placidly
than
when
he
happened
to
know
the
worst
he
had
known
it
on
the
occasion
i
speak
is
immediately
after
he
was
impenetrable
then
but
ultimately
confessed
what
he
confessed
was
more
than
i
shall
now
venture
to
make
public
it
was
of
course
familiar
to
me
that
saltram
was
incapable
of
keeping
the
engagements
which
after
their
separation
he
had
entered
into
with
regard
to
his
wife
a
deeply
wronged
justly
resentful
quite
irreproachable
and
insufferable
person
she
often
appeared
at
my
chambers
to
talk
over
his
lapses
for
if
as
she
declared
she
had
washed
her
hands
of
him
she
had
carefully
preserved
the
water
of
this
ablution
which
she
handed
about
for
analysis
she
had
arts
of
her
own
of
exciting
impatience
the
most
infallible
of
which
was
perhaps
her
assumption
that
we
were
kind
to
her
because
we
liked
her
in
reality
her
personal
fall
had
been
a
sort
of
social
i
had
seen
the
moment
when
in
our
little
conscientious
circle
her
desolation
almost
made
her
the
fashion
her
voice
was
grating
and
her
children
ugly
moreover
she
hated
the
good
mulvilles
whom
i
more
and
more
loved
they
were
the
people
who
by
doing
most
for
her
husband
had
in
the
long
run
done
most
for
herself
and
the
warm
confidence
with
which
he
had
laid
his
length
upon
them
was
a
pressure
gentle
compared
with
her
stiffer
persuadability
bound
to
say
he
criticise
his
benefactors
though
practically
he
got
tired
of
them
she
however
had
the
highest
standards
about
eleemosynary
forms
she
offered
the
odd
spectacle
of
a
spirit
puffed
up
by
dependence
and
indeed
it
had
introduced
her
to
some
excellent
society
she
pitied
me
for
not
knowing
certain
people
who
aided
her
and
whom
she
doubtless
patronised
in
turn
for
their
luck
in
not
knowing
me
i
dare
say
i
should
have
got
on
with
her
better
if
she
had
had
a
ray
of
it
had
occasionally
seemed
to
occur
to
her
to
regard
expressions
of
his
nature
in
any
other
manner
than
as
separate
subjects
of
woe
they
were
all
flowers
of
his
character
pearls
strung
on
an
endless
thread
but
she
had
a
stubborn
little
way
of
challenging
them
one
after
the
other
as
if
she
never
suspected
that
he
had
a
character
such
as
it
was
or
that
deficiencies
might
be
organic
the
irritating
effect
of
a
mind
incapable
of
a
generalisation
one
might
doubtless
have
overdone
the
idea
that
there
was
a
general
licence
for
such
a
man
but
if
this
had
happened
it
would
have
been
through
feeling
that
there
could
be
none
for
such
a
woman
i
recognised
her
superiority
when
i
asked
her
about
the
aunt
of
the
disappointed
young
lady
it
sounded
like
a
sentence
from
an
or
other
she
triumphed
in
what
she
told
me
and
she
may
have
triumphed
still
more
in
what
she
withheld
my
friend
of
the
other
evening
miss
anvoy
had
but
lately
come
to
england
lady
coxon
the
aunt
had
been
established
here
for
years
in
consequence
of
her
marriage
with
the
late
sir
gregory
of
that
name
she
had
a
house
in
the
park
a
and
a
fernery
and
above
all
she
had
sympathy
saltram
had
made
her
acquaintance
through
mutual
friends
this
vagueness
caused
me
to
feel
how
much
i
was
out
of
it
and
how
large
an
independent
circle
saltram
had
at
her
command
i
should
have
been
glad
to
know
more
about
the
disappointed
young
lady
but
i
felt
i
should
know
most
by
not
depriving
her
of
her
advantage
as
she
might
have
mysterious
means
of
depriving
me
of
my
knowledge
for
the
present
moreover
this
experience
was
stayed
lady
coxon
having
in
fact
gone
abroad
accompanied
by
her
niece
the
niece
besides
being
immensely
clever
was
an
heiress
saltram
said
the
only
daughter
and
the
light
of
the
eyes
of
some
great
american
merchant
a
man
over
there
of
endless
indulgences
and
dollars
she
had
pretty
clothes
and
pretty
manners
and
she
had
what
was
prettier
still
the
great
thing
of
all
the
great
thing
of
all
for
saltram
was
always
sympathy
and
she
spoke
as
if
during
the
absence
of
these
ladies
she
know
where
to
turn
for
it
a
few
months
later
indeed
when
they
had
come
back
her
tone
perceptibly
changed
she
alluded
to
them
on
my
leading
her
up
to
it
rather
as
to
persons
in
her
debt
for
favours
received
what
had
happened
i
know
but
i
saw
it
would
take
only
a
little
more
or
a
little
less
to
make
her
speak
of
them
as
thankless
subjects
of
social
for
whom
she
had
vainly
tried
to
do
something
i
confess
i
saw
how
it
be
in
a
mere
week
or
two
that
i
should
rid
myself
of
the
image
of
ruth
anvoy
in
whose
very
name
when
i
learnt
it
i
found
something
secretly
to
like
i
should
probably
neither
see
her
nor
hear
of
her
again
the
widow
he
had
been
mayor
of
clockborough
would
pass
away
and
the
heiress
would
return
to
her
inheritance
i
gathered
with
surprise
that
she
had
not
communicated
to
his
wife
the
story
of
her
attempt
to
hear
and
i
founded
this
reticence
on
the
easy
supposition
that
saltram
had
fatigued
by
overpressure
the
spring
of
the
sympathy
of
which
she
boasted
the
girl
at
any
rate
would
forget
the
small
adventure
be
distracted
take
a
husband
besides
which
she
would
lack
occasion
to
repeat
her
experiment
we
clung
to
the
idea
of
the
brilliant
course
delivered
without
an
accident
that
as
a
lecturer
would
still
make
the
paying
public
aware
of
our
great
man
but
the
fact
remained
that
in
the
case
of
an
inspiration
so
unequal
there
was
treachery
there
was
fallacy
at
least
in
the
very
conception
of
a
series
in
our
scrutiny
of
ways
and
means
we
were
inevitably
subject
to
the
old
convention
of
the
synopsis
the
syllabus
partly
of
course
not
to
lose
the
advantage
of
his
grand
free
hand
in
drawing
up
such
things
but
for
myself
i
laughed
at
our
playbills
even
while
i
stickled
for
them
it
was
indeed
amusing
work
to
be
scrupulous
for
frank
saltram
who
also
at
moments
laughed
about
it
so
far
as
the
comfort
of
a
sigh
so
unstudied
as
to
be
cheerful
might
pass
for
such
a
sound
he
admitted
with
a
candour
all
his
own
that
he
was
in
truth
only
to
be
depended
on
in
the
he
suggestively
allowed
there
i
think
that
at
my
best
quite
late
when
it
gets
toward
if
not
been
too
much
we
all
knew
what
too
much
worry
meant
it
meant
too
enslaved
for
the
hour
to
the
superstition
of
sobriety
on
the
saturdays
i
used
to
bring
my
portmanteau
so
as
not
to
have
to
think
of
eleven
trains
i
had
a
bold
theory
that
as
regards
this
temple
of
talk
and
its
altars
of
cushioned
chintz
its
pictures
and
its
flowers
its
large
fireside
and
clear
lamplight
we
might
really
arrive
at
something
if
the
mulvilles
would
but
charge
for
admission
here
it
was
however
that
they
shamelessly
broke
down
as
a
flaw
in
every
perfection
this
was
the
inexpugnable
refuge
of
their
egotism
they
declined
to
make
their
saloon
a
market
so
that
golden
words
continued
the
sole
coin
that
rang
there
it
can
have
happened
to
no
man
however
to
be
paid
a
greater
price
than
such
an
enchanted
hush
as
surrounded
him
on
his
greatest
nights
the
most
profane
on
these
occasions
felt
a
presence
all
minor
eloquence
grew
dumb
adelaide
mulville
for
the
pride
of
her
hospitality
anxiously
watched
the
door
or
stealthily
poked
the
fire
i
used
to
call
it
the
for
we
had
anticipated
bayreuth
the
very
gates
of
the
kingdom
of
light
seemed
to
open
and
the
horizon
of
thought
to
flash
with
the
beauty
of
a
sunrise
at
sea
in
the
consideration
of
ways
and
means
the
sittings
of
our
little
board
we
were
always
conscious
of
the
creak
of
shoes
she
hovered
she
interrupted
she
almost
presided
the
state
of
affairs
being
mostly
such
as
to
supply
her
with
every
incentive
for
enquiring
what
was
to
be
done
next
it
was
the
pressing
pursuit
of
this
knowledge
that
in
concatenations
of
omnibuses
and
usually
in
very
wet
weather
led
her
so
often
to
my
door
she
thought
us
spiritless
creatures
with
editors
and
publishers
but
she
carried
matters
to
no
great
effect
when
she
personally
pushed
into
she
wanted
all
moneys
to
be
paid
to
herself
they
were
otherwise
liable
to
such
strange
adventures
they
trickled
away
into
the
were
mainly
at
best
alas
a
slender
stream
the
editors
and
the
publishers
were
the
last
people
to
take
this
remarkable
thinker
at
the
valuation
that
has
now
pretty
well
come
to
be
established
the
former
were
between
the
desire
to
him
and
the
difficulty
of
finding
a
crevice
for
their
shears
and
when
a
volume
on
this
or
that
portentous
subject
was
proposed
to
the
latter
they
suggested
alternative
titles
which
as
reported
to
our
friend
brought
into
his
face
the
noble
blank
melancholy
that
sometimes
made
it
handsome
the
title
of
an
unwritten
book
after
all
much
matter
but
some
masterpiece
of
may
have
died
in
his
bosom
of
the
shudder
with
which
it
was
then
convulsed
the
ideal
solution
failing
the
fee
at
kent
door
would
have
been
some
system
of
subscription
to
projected
treatises
with
their
provided
for
i
mean
by
the
indulgence
of
subscribers
the
real
misfortune
was
that
subscribers
were
so
wretchedly
literal
when
they
tastelessly
enquired
why
publication
ensued
i
was
tempted
to
ask
who
in
the
world
had
ever
been
so
published
nature
herself
had
brought
him
out
in
voluminous
form
and
the
money
was
simply
a
deposit
on
borrowing
the
work
v
i
was
doubtless
often
a
nuisance
to
my
friends
in
those
years
but
there
were
sacrifices
i
declined
to
make
and
i
never
passed
the
hat
to
george
gravener
i
never
forgot
our
little
discussion
in
ebury
street
and
i
think
it
stuck
in
my
throat
to
have
to
treat
him
to
the
avowal
i
had
found
so
easy
to
mss
anvoy
it
had
cost
me
nothing
to
confide
to
this
charming
girl
but
it
would
have
cost
me
much
to
confide
to
the
friend
of
my
youth
that
the
character
of
the
an
attribute
of
the
man
i
took
such
pains
for
was
this
because
i
had
already
generalised
to
the
point
of
perceiving
that
women
are
really
the
unfastidious
sex
i
knew
at
any
rate
that
gravener
already
quite
in
view
but
still
hungry
and
frugal
had
naturally
enough
more
ambition
than
charity
he
had
sharp
aims
for
stray
sovereigns
being
in
view
most
from
the
tall
steeple
of
clockborough
his
immediate
ambition
was
to
occupy
√†
lui
seul
the
field
of
vision
of
that
city
and
all
his
movements
and
postures
were
calculated
for
the
favouring
angle
the
movement
of
the
hand
as
to
the
pocket
had
thus
to
alternate
gracefully
with
the
posture
of
the
hand
on
the
heart
he
talked
to
clockborough
in
short
only
less
beguilingly
than
frank
saltram
talked
to
his
electors
with
the
difference
to
our
credit
however
that
we
had
already
voted
and
that
our
candidate
had
no
antagonist
but
himself
he
had
more
than
once
been
at
was
work
not
by
the
time
the
claret
was
served
had
seen
the
god
descend
he
took
more
pains
to
swing
his
censer
than
i
had
expected
but
on
our
way
back
to
town
he
forestalled
any
little
triumph
i
might
have
been
so
artless
as
to
express
by
the
observation
that
such
a
man
hundred
times
man
to
use
and
never
a
man
to
be
used
by
i
remember
that
this
neat
remark
humiliated
me
almost
as
much
as
if
virtually
in
the
fever
of
broken
slumbers
i
often
made
it
myself
the
difference
was
that
on
part
a
force
attached
to
it
that
could
never
attach
to
it
on
mine
he
was
able
to
use
had
the
machinery
and
the
irony
of
being
made
showy
at
clockborough
came
out
to
me
when
he
said
as
if
he
had
no
memory
of
our
original
talk
and
the
idea
were
quite
fresh
to
him
hate
his
type
you
know
but
be
hanged
if
i
put
some
of
those
things
in
i
can
find
a
place
for
them
we
might
even
find
a
place
for
the
fellow
i
myself
should
have
had
some
i
need
scarcely
say
for
the
themselves
but
for
some
other
things
very
near
them
in
fine
for
the
rest
of
my
eloquence
later
on
i
could
see
that
the
oracle
of
wimbledon
was
not
in
this
case
so
appropriate
as
he
would
have
been
had
the
polities
of
the
gods
only
coincided
more
exactly
with
those
of
the
party
there
was
a
distinct
moment
when
without
saying
anything
more
definite
to
me
gravener
entertained
the
idea
of
annexing
saltram
such
a
project
was
delusive
for
the
discovery
of
analogies
between
his
body
of
doctrine
and
that
pressed
from
headquarters
upon
bottling
in
a
word
of
the
air
of
those
lungs
for
convenient
public
uncorking
in
an
experiment
for
which
no
one
had
the
leisure
the
only
thing
would
have
been
to
carry
him
massively
about
paid
caged
clipped
to
turn
him
on
for
a
particular
occasion
in
a
particular
channel
frank
channel
however
was
essentially
not
calculable
and
there
was
no
knowing
what
disastrous
floods
might
have
ensued
for
what
there
would
have
been
to
do
the
empire
the
great
newspaper
was
there
to
look
to
but
it
was
no
new
misfortune
that
there
were
delicate
situations
in
which
the
empire
broke
down
in
fine
there
was
an
instinctive
apprehension
that
a
clever
young
journalist
commissioned
to
report
on
saltram
might
never
come
back
from
the
errand
no
one
knew
better
than
george
gravener
that
that
was
a
time
when
prompt
returns
counted
double
if
he
therefore
found
our
friend
an
exasperating
waste
of
orthodoxy
it
was
because
of
his
being
as
he
said
poor
gravener
up
in
the
clouds
not
because
he
was
down
in
the
dust
the
man
would
have
been
just
as
he
was
a
real
enough
gentleman
if
he
could
have
helped
to
put
in
a
real
gentleman
great
objection
to
the
actual
member
was
that
he
was
not
one
lady
coxon
had
a
fine
old
house
a
house
with
at
clockborough
which
she
had
let
but
after
she
returned
from
abroad
i
learned
from
saltram
that
the
lease
had
fallen
in
and
that
she
had
gone
down
to
resume
possession
i
could
see
the
faded
red
livery
the
big
square
shoulders
the
garden
of
this
decent
abode
as
the
rumble
of
dissolution
grew
louder
the
suitor
would
have
pressed
his
suit
and
i
found
myself
hoping
the
politics
of
the
late
widow
be
such
as
to
admonish
her
to
ask
him
to
dinner
perhaps
indeed
i
went
so
far
as
to
pray
they
would
naturally
form
a
bar
to
any
contact
i
tried
to
focus
the
page
in
the
daily
airing
as
he
perhaps
even
pushed
the
over
toes
i
was
destined
to
hear
none
the
less
through
i
afterwards
learned
was
in
correspondence
with
lady
gravener
was
known
to
have
spoken
of
the
habitation
i
had
in
my
eye
as
the
pleasantest
thing
at
clockborough
on
his
part
i
was
sure
this
was
the
voice
not
of
envy
but
of
experience
the
vivid
scene
was
now
peopled
and
i
could
see
him
in
the
garden
with
miss
anvoy
who
would
be
certain
and
very
justly
to
think
him
it
would
be
too
much
to
describe
myself
as
troubled
by
this
play
of
surmise
but
i
occur
to
remember
the
relief
singular
enough
of
feeling
it
suddenly
brushed
away
by
an
annoyance
really
much
greater
an
annoyance
the
result
of
its
happening
to
come
over
me
about
that
time
with
a
rush
that
i
was
simply
ashamed
of
frank
saltram
there
were
limits
after
all
and
my
mark
at
last
had
been
reached
i
had
had
my
disgusts
if
i
may
allow
myself
such
an
expression
but
this
was
a
supreme
revolt
certain
things
cleared
up
in
my
mind
certain
values
stood
out
it
was
all
very
well
to
have
an
unfortunate
temperament
there
was
nothing
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
for
practical
purposes
nothing
else
i
avoided
george
gravener
at
this
moment
and
reflected
that
at
such
a
time
i
should
do
so
most
effectually
by
leaving
england
i
wanted
to
forget
frank
was
all
i
want
to
do
anything
in
the
world
to
him
but
that
indignation
had
withered
on
the
stalk
and
i
felt
that
one
could
pity
him
as
much
as
one
ought
only
by
never
thinking
of
him
again
it
for
anything
he
had
done
to
me
it
was
for
what
he
had
done
to
the
mulvilles
adelaide
cried
about
it
for
a
week
and
her
husband
profiting
by
the
example
so
signally
given
him
of
the
fatal
effect
of
a
want
of
character
left
the
letter
the
drop
too
much
unanswered
the
letter
an
incredible
one
addressed
by
saltram
to
wimbledon
during
a
stay
with
the
pudneys
at
ramsgate
was
the
central
feature
of
the
incident
which
however
had
many
features
each
more
painful
than
whichever
other
we
compared
it
with
the
pudneys
had
behaved
shockingly
but
that
was
no
excuse
base
ingratitude
gross
had
choice
only
of
such
formulas
as
that
the
more
they
fitted
the
less
they
gave
one
rest
these
are
dead
aches
now
and
i
am
under
no
obligation
thank
heaven
to
be
definite
about
the
business
there
are
things
which
if
i
had
had
to
tell
would
have
stopped
me
off
here
altogether
i
went
abroad
for
the
general
election
and
if
i
know
how
much
on
the
continent
i
forgot
i
at
least
know
how
much
i
missed
him
at
a
distance
in
a
foreign
land
ignoring
abjuring
unlearning
him
i
discovered
what
he
had
done
for
me
i
owed
him
oh
unmistakeably
certain
noble
conceptions
i
had
lighted
my
little
taper
at
his
smoky
lamp
and
lo
it
continued
to
twinkle
but
the
light
it
gave
me
just
showed
me
how
much
more
i
wanted
i
was
pursued
of
course
by
letters
from
saltram
which
i
scruple
not
to
read
though
quite
aware
her
embarrassments
but
be
now
of
the
gravest
i
sacrificed
to
propriety
by
simply
putting
them
away
and
this
is
how
one
day
as
my
absence
drew
to
an
end
my
eye
while
i
rummaged
in
my
desk
for
another
paper
was
caught
by
a
name
on
a
leaf
that
had
detached
itself
from
the
packet
the
allusion
was
to
miss
anvoy
who
it
appeared
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
george
gravener
and
the
news
was
two
months
old
a
direct
question
of
had
thus
remained
had
enquired
of
me
in
a
postscript
what
sort
of
man
this
aspirant
to
such
a
hand
might
be
the
great
other
fact
about
him
just
then
was
that
he
had
been
triumphantly
returned
for
clockborough
in
the
interest
of
the
party
that
had
swept
the
that
i
might
easily
have
referred
saltram
to
the
journals
of
the
day
yet
when
i
at
last
wrote
her
that
i
was
coming
home
and
would
discharge
my
accumulated
burden
by
seeing
her
i
but
remarked
in
regard
to
her
question
that
she
must
really
put
it
to
miss
anvoy
vi
i
had
almost
avoided
the
general
election
but
some
of
its
consequences
on
my
return
had
smartly
to
be
faced
the
season
in
london
began
to
breathe
again
and
to
flap
its
folded
wings
confidence
under
the
new
ministry
was
understood
to
be
reviving
and
one
of
the
symptoms
in
a
social
body
was
a
recovery
of
appetite
people
once
more
fed
together
and
it
happened
that
one
saturday
night
at
house
i
fed
with
george
gravener
when
the
ladies
left
the
room
i
moved
up
to
where
he
sat
and
begged
to
congratulate
him
my
election
he
asked
after
a
moment
so
that
i
could
feign
jocosely
not
to
have
heard
of
that
triumph
and
to
be
alluding
to
the
rumour
of
a
victory
still
more
personal
i
dare
say
i
coloured
however
for
his
political
success
had
momentarily
passed
out
of
my
mind
what
was
present
to
it
was
that
he
was
to
marry
that
beautiful
girl
and
yet
his
question
made
me
conscious
of
some
intended
to
put
this
before
everything
he
himself
indeed
ought
gracefully
to
have
done
so
and
i
remember
thinking
the
whole
man
was
in
this
assumption
that
in
expressing
my
sense
of
what
he
had
won
i
had
fixed
my
thoughts
on
his
we
straightened
the
matter
out
and
he
was
so
much
lighter
in
hand
than
i
had
lately
seen
him
that
his
spirits
might
well
have
been
fed
from
a
twofold
source
he
was
so
good
as
to
say
that
he
hoped
i
should
soon
make
the
acquaintance
of
miss
anvoy
who
with
her
aunt
was
presently
coming
up
to
town
lady
coxon
in
the
country
had
been
seriously
unwell
and
this
had
delayed
their
arrival
i
told
him
i
had
heard
the
marriage
would
be
a
splendid
one
on
which
brightened
and
humanised
by
his
luck
he
laughed
and
said
you
mean
for
her
when
i
had
again
explained
what
i
meant
he
went
on
an
american
but
scarcely
know
it
unless
perhaps
he
added
her
being
used
to
more
money
than
most
girls
in
england
even
the
daughters
of
rich
men
that
in
the
least
do
for
a
fellow
like
me
you
know
if
it
for
the
great
liberality
of
her
father
he
really
has
been
most
kind
and
quite
he
added
that
his
eldest
brother
had
taken
a
tremendous
fancy
to
her
and
that
during
a
recent
visit
at
coldfield
she
had
nearly
won
over
lady
maddock
i
gathered
from
something
he
dropped
later
on
that
the
gentleman
beyond
the
seas
had
not
made
a
settlement
but
had
given
a
handsome
present
and
was
apparently
to
be
looked
to
across
the
water
for
other
favours
people
are
simplified
alike
by
great
contentments
and
great
yearnings
and
whether
or
no
it
was
directness
that
begot
my
own
i
seem
to
recall
that
in
some
turn
taken
by
our
talk
he
almost
imposed
it
on
me
as
an
act
of
decorum
to
ask
if
miss
anvoy
had
also
by
chance
expectations
from
her
aunt
my
enquiry
drew
out
that
lady
coxon
who
was
the
oddest
of
women
would
have
in
any
contingency
to
act
under
her
late
will
which
was
odder
still
saddling
her
with
a
mass
of
queer
obligations
complicated
with
queer
loopholes
there
were
several
dreary
people
coxon
cousins
old
maids
to
whom
she
would
have
more
or
less
to
minister
gravener
laughed
without
saying
no
when
i
suggested
that
the
young
lady
might
come
in
through
a
loophole
then
suddenly
as
if
he
suspected
my
turning
a
lantern
on
him
he
declared
quite
dryly
all
moved
by
other
springs
a
fortnight
later
at
lady
own
house
i
understood
well
enough
the
springs
one
was
moved
by
gravener
had
spoken
of
me
there
as
an
old
friend
and
i
received
a
gracious
invitation
to
dine
the
widow
was
again
had
succumbed
at
the
eleventh
hour
so
that
i
found
miss
anvoy
bravely
playing
hostess
without
even
help
since
to
make
matters
worse
he
had
just
sent
up
word
that
the
house
the
insatiable
house
with
which
he
supposed
he
had
contracted
for
easier
terms
positively
declined
to
release
him
i
was
struck
with
the
courage
the
grace
and
gaiety
of
the
young
lady
left
thus
to
handle
the
fauna
and
flora
of
the
park
i
did
what
i
could
to
help
her
to
classify
them
after
i
had
recovered
from
the
confusion
of
seeing
her
slightly
disconcerted
at
perceiving
in
the
guest
introduced
by
her
intended
the
gentleman
with
whom
she
had
had
that
talk
about
frank
saltram
i
had
at
this
moment
my
first
glimpse
of
the
fact
that
she
was
a
person
who
could
carry
a
responsibility
but
i
leave
the
reader
to
judge
of
my
sense
of
the
aggravation
for
either
of
us
of
such
a
burden
when
i
heard
the
servant
announce
saltram
from
what
immediately
passed
between
the
two
ladies
i
gathered
that
the
latter
had
been
sent
for
to
fill
the
gap
created
by
the
absence
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
i
remember
crying
be
put
by
me
and
my
apprehension
was
promptly
justified
saltram
taken
in
to
dinner
and
taken
in
as
a
consequence
of
an
appeal
to
her
amiability
was
saltram
with
a
vengeance
i
asked
myself
what
miss
anvoy
meant
by
doing
such
things
but
the
only
answer
i
arrived
at
was
that
gravener
was
verily
fortunate
she
happened
to
tell
him
of
her
visit
to
upper
baker
street
but
certainly
tell
him
not
indeed
that
this
would
make
him
like
any
better
her
having
had
the
innocence
to
invite
such
a
person
as
saltram
on
such
an
occasion
it
could
only
strike
me
that
i
had
never
seen
a
young
woman
put
such
ignorance
into
her
cleverness
such
freedom
into
her
modesty
this
i
think
was
when
after
dinner
she
said
to
me
frankly
with
almost
jubilant
mirth
you
admire
saltram
why
should
i
this
was
truly
a
young
person
without
guile
i
had
briefly
to
consider
before
i
could
reply
that
my
objection
to
the
lady
named
was
the
objection
often
uttered
about
people
met
at
the
social
knew
all
her
stories
then
as
miss
anvoy
remained
momentarily
vague
i
added
about
her
yes
but
there
are
some
new
for
me
ah
novelty
would
be
pleasant
it
appear
that
of
late
he
has
been
particularly
horrid
fluctuations
i
returned
at
night
all
cats
are
grey
you
saw
the
shade
of
this
one
the
night
we
waited
for
him
together
what
will
you
have
he
has
no
miss
anvoy
who
had
been
introducing
with
her
american
distinctness
looked
encouragingly
round
at
some
of
the
combinations
she
had
risked
too
bad
i
see
mean
gravener
let
you
asked
him
he
lets
me
do
you
know
he
knows
him
and
wonders
what
some
of
us
see
in
happened
to
talk
of
him
the
girl
said
him
to
take
you
some
day
out
to
see
the
thought
saltram
had
thrown
the
mulvilles
but
that
prevent
his
being
planted
there
again
to
bloom
like
a
rose
within
a
month
or
miss
anvoy
thought
a
moment
then
should
like
to
see
them
she
said
with
her
fostering
smile
tremendously
worth
it
you
miss
make
george
take
me
she
went
on
as
saltram
came
up
to
interrupt
us
she
sniffed
at
this
unfortunate
as
kindly
as
she
had
smiled
at
me
and
addressing
the
question
to
her
continued
the
chance
of
a
of
the
wonderful
lectures
there
another
course
announced
there
are
about
thirty
i
exclaimed
turning
away
and
feeling
little
eyes
in
my
back
a
few
days
after
this
i
heard
that
marriage
was
near
at
settled
for
whitsuntide
but
as
no
invitation
had
reached
me
i
had
my
doubts
and
there
presently
came
to
me
in
fact
the
report
of
a
postponement
something
was
the
matter
what
was
the
matter
was
supposed
to
be
that
lady
coxon
was
now
critically
ill
i
had
called
on
her
after
my
dinner
in
the
park
but
i
had
neither
seen
her
nor
seen
miss
anvoy
i
forget
the
exact
order
in
which
at
this
period
sundry
incidents
occurred
and
the
particular
stage
at
which
it
suddenly
struck
me
making
me
catch
my
breath
a
little
that
the
progression
the
acceleration
was
for
all
the
world
that
of
fine
drama
this
was
probably
rather
late
in
the
day
and
the
exact
order
signify
what
had
already
occurred
was
some
accident
determining
a
more
patient
wait
george
gravener
whom
i
met
again
in
fact
told
me
as
much
but
without
signs
of
perturbation
lady
coxon
had
to
be
constantly
attended
to
and
there
were
other
good
reasons
as
well
lady
coxon
had
to
be
so
constantly
attended
to
that
on
the
occasion
of
a
second
attempt
in
the
park
i
equally
failed
to
obtain
a
sight
of
her
niece
i
judged
it
discreet
in
all
the
conditions
not
to
make
a
third
but
this
matter
for
it
was
through
adelaide
mulville
that
the
of
the
comedy
though
i
was
at
first
unwitting
began
to
reach
me
i
went
to
wimbledon
at
times
because
saltram
was
there
and
i
went
at
others
because
he
the
pudneys
who
had
taken
him
to
birmingham
had
already
got
rid
of
him
and
we
had
a
horrible
consciousness
of
his
wandering
roofless
in
dishonour
about
the
smoky
midlands
almost
as
the
injured
lear
wandered
on
the
heath
his
room
upstairs
had
been
lately
done
up
i
could
hear
the
crackle
of
the
new
chintz
and
the
difference
only
made
his
smirches
and
bruises
his
splendid
tainted
genius
the
more
tragic
if
he
barefoot
in
the
mire
he
was
sure
to
be
unconventionally
shod
these
were
the
things
adelaide
and
i
who
were
old
enough
friends
to
stare
at
each
other
in
silence
talked
about
when
we
speak
when
we
spoke
it
was
only
about
the
brilliant
girl
george
gravener
was
to
marry
and
whom
he
had
brought
out
the
other
sunday
i
could
see
that
this
presentation
had
been
happy
for
mulville
commemorated
it
after
her
sole
fashion
of
showing
confidence
in
a
new
relation
likes
likes
her
native
humility
exulted
in
that
measure
of
success
we
all
knew
for
ourselves
how
she
liked
those
who
liked
her
and
as
regards
ruth
anvoy
she
was
more
easily
won
over
than
lady
maddock
vii
one
of
the
consequences
for
the
mulvilles
of
the
sacrifices
they
made
for
frank
saltram
was
that
they
had
to
give
up
their
carriage
adelaide
drove
gently
into
london
in
a
greenish
thing
an
early
victorian
landau
hired
near
at
hand
imaginatively
from
a
jobmaster
whose
wife
was
in
vehicle
that
made
people
turn
round
all
the
more
when
her
pensioner
sat
beside
her
in
a
soft
white
hat
and
a
shawl
one
of
the
dear
own
this
was
his
position
and
i
dare
say
his
costume
when
on
an
afternoon
in
july
she
went
to
return
miss
visit
the
wheel
of
fate
had
now
revolved
and
amid
silences
deep
and
exhaustive
compunctions
and
condonations
alike
unutterable
saltram
was
reinstated
was
it
in
pride
or
in
penance
that
mulville
had
begun
immediately
to
drive
him
about
if
he
was
ashamed
of
his
ingratitude
she
might
have
been
ashamed
of
her
forgiveness
but
she
was
incorrigibly
capable
of
liking
him
to
be
conspicuous
in
the
landau
while
she
was
in
shops
or
with
her
acquaintance
however
if
he
was
in
the
pillory
for
twenty
minutes
in
the
mean
at
lady
door
while
his
companion
paid
her
to
the
further
humiliation
of
any
one
concerned
that
she
presently
came
out
for
him
in
person
not
even
to
show
either
of
them
what
a
fool
she
was
that
she
drew
him
in
to
be
introduced
to
the
bright
young
american
her
account
of
the
introduction
i
had
in
its
order
but
before
that
very
late
in
the
season
under
auspices
i
met
miss
anvoy
at
tea
at
the
house
of
commons
the
member
for
clockborough
had
gathered
a
group
of
pretty
ladies
and
the
mulvilles
were
not
of
the
party
on
the
great
terrace
as
i
strolled
off
with
her
a
little
the
guest
of
honour
immediately
exclaimed
to
me
seen
him
you
seen
him
she
told
me
about
call
how
did
you
find
him
so
strange
like
him
tell
till
i
see
him
want
to
do
that
she
had
a
pause
we
went
no
further
i
fancied
she
had
become
aware
gravener
was
looking
at
us
she
turned
back
toward
the
knot
of
the
others
and
i
said
him
as
much
as
you
see
i
thought
she
coloured
a
little
it
matter
i
laughed
die
of
hope
i
die
of
anything
before
seen
more
of
i
rejoiced
with
her
over
plain
adelaide
whom
she
pronounced
the
loveliest
woman
she
had
met
in
england
but
before
we
separated
i
remarked
to
her
that
it
was
an
act
of
mere
humanity
to
warn
her
that
if
she
should
see
more
of
frank
would
be
likely
to
follow
on
any
increase
of
acquaintance
with
might
find
herself
flattening
her
nose
against
the
clear
hard
pane
of
an
eternal
of
the
relative
that
of
the
opposed
importances
of
virtue
and
brains
she
replied
that
this
was
surely
a
subject
on
which
one
took
everything
for
granted
whereupon
i
admitted
that
i
had
perhaps
expressed
myself
what
i
referred
to
was
what
i
had
referred
to
the
night
we
met
in
upper
baker
relative
importance
relative
to
virtue
of
other
gifts
she
asked
me
if
i
called
virtue
a
thing
handed
to
us
in
a
parcel
on
our
first
birthday
and
i
declared
that
this
very
enquiry
proved
to
me
the
problem
had
already
caught
her
by
the
skirt
she
would
have
help
however
the
same
help
i
myself
had
once
had
in
resisting
its
tendency
to
make
one
cross
help
do
you
mean
of
the
member
for
she
stared
smiled
then
returned
my
idea
has
been
to
help
him
she
had
helped
had
his
own
word
for
it
that
at
clockborough
her
bedevilment
of
the
voters
had
really
put
him
in
she
would
do
so
doubtless
again
and
again
though
i
heard
the
very
next
month
that
this
fine
faculty
had
undergone
a
temporary
eclipse
news
of
the
catastrophe
first
came
to
me
from
saltram
and
it
was
afterwards
confirmed
at
wimbledon
poor
miss
anvoy
was
in
disasters
in
america
had
suddenly
summoned
her
home
her
father
in
new
york
had
suffered
reverses
lost
so
much
money
that
it
was
really
vexatious
as
showing
how
much
he
had
had
it
was
adelaide
who
told
me
she
had
gone
off
alone
at
less
than
a
notice
gravener
has
permitted
that
will
you
have
the
house
of
commons
afraid
i
cursed
the
house
of
commons
i
was
so
much
interested
of
course
follow
her
as
soon
as
he
was
free
to
make
her
his
wife
only
she
now
be
able
to
bring
him
anything
like
the
of
which
he
had
begun
by
having
the
virtual
promise
mulville
let
me
know
what
was
already
said
she
was
charming
this
american
girl
but
really
these
american
what
was
a
man
to
do
saltram
according
to
mulville
was
of
opinion
that
a
man
was
never
to
suffer
his
relation
to
money
to
become
a
spiritual
was
to
keep
it
exclusively
material
pas
comprendre
i
commented
on
this
in
rejoinder
to
which
adelaide
with
her
beautiful
sympathy
explained
that
she
supposed
he
simply
meant
that
the
thing
was
to
use
it
you
know
but
not
to
think
too
much
about
it
take
it
but
not
to
thank
you
for
it
i
still
more
profanely
enquired
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
she
look
at
me
but
this
prevent
my
asking
her
what
had
been
the
result
that
the
park
of
her
taking
our
friend
to
see
miss
anvoy
so
charming
she
answered
brightening
said
he
recognised
in
her
a
nature
he
could
absolutely
but
speaking
of
the
effect
on
mulville
had
to
remount
the
stream
was
everything
one
could
something
in
her
tone
made
me
laugh
you
mean
she
gave
dole
since
you
ask
me
there
on
the
spot
again
poor
adelaide
faltered
was
to
me
of
course
she
gave
i
stared
somehow
i
see
the
scene
you
mean
a
sum
of
money
was
very
now
at
last
she
met
my
eyes
though
i
could
see
it
was
with
an
effort
out
of
her
pocket
of
the
drawer
of
a
table
at
which
she
had
been
writing
she
just
slipped
the
folded
notes
into
my
hand
he
looking
it
was
while
he
was
going
back
to
the
said
adelaide
reassuringly
take
care
of
it
for
him
the
dear
practical
soul
thought
my
agitation
for
i
confess
i
was
agitated
referred
to
the
employment
of
the
money
her
disclosure
made
me
for
a
moment
muse
violently
and
i
dare
say
that
during
that
moment
i
wondered
if
anything
else
in
the
world
makes
people
so
gross
as
unselfishness
i
uttered
i
suppose
some
vague
synthetic
cry
for
she
went
on
as
if
she
had
had
a
glimpse
of
my
inward
amaze
at
such
passages
assure
you
my
dear
friend
he
was
in
one
of
his
happy
but
i
thinking
of
that
indeed
these
americans
i
said
her
father
in
the
very
act
as
it
were
of
swindling
her
betrothed
mulville
stared
i
suppose
anvoy
has
scarcely
gone
whatever
he
has
purpose
very
likely
they
be
able
to
keep
it
up
but
there
it
was
and
it
was
a
very
beautiful
say
saltram
was
very
fine
everything
he
surprised
even
i
know
what
after
a
moment
i
added
he
peradventure
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
money
in
the
at
this
my
companion
honestly
flushed
can
you
be
so
cruel
when
you
know
how
little
he
calculates
me
i
do
know
it
but
you
tell
me
things
that
act
on
my
nerves
sure
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
anything
but
some
splendid
mulville
brightly
concurred
perhaps
even
of
her
beautiful
listening
even
and
what
was
it
all
about
talk
it
was
apropos
of
her
engagement
which
i
had
told
him
about
the
idea
of
marriage
the
philosophy
the
poetry
the
sublimity
of
it
was
impossible
wholly
to
restrain
mirth
at
this
and
some
rude
ripple
that
i
emitted
again
caused
my
companion
to
admonish
me
sounds
a
little
stale
but
you
know
his
illustration
indeed
i
do
how
he
has
always
been
right
on
that
great
what
great
question
dear
lady
he
been
right
what
other
great
men
can
you
equally
say
it
that
he
has
never
but
never
had
a
deflexion
mulville
exultantly
demanded
i
tried
to
think
of
some
other
great
man
but
i
had
to
give
it
up
miss
anvoy
express
her
satisfaction
in
any
less
diffident
way
than
by
her
charming
present
i
was
reduced
to
asking
instead
yes
she
overflowed
to
me
on
the
steps
while
he
was
getting
into
the
these
words
somehow
brushed
up
a
picture
of
big
shawled
back
as
he
hoisted
himself
into
the
green
landau
said
she
disappointed
adelaide
pursued
i
turned
it
over
he
wear
his
shawl
shawl
she
even
noticed
mean
looked
very
nice
and
you
know
really
clean
miss
anvoy
used
such
a
remarkable
said
his
like
a
crystal
i
pricked
up
my
ears
crystal
in
the
moral
and
shining
and
flashing
there
monstrously
clever
you
i
thought
again
viii
george
gravener
follow
her
for
late
in
september
after
the
house
had
risen
i
met
him
in
a
he
was
coming
up
from
scotland
and
i
had
just
quitted
some
relations
who
lived
near
durham
the
current
of
travel
back
to
london
yet
strong
at
any
rate
on
entering
the
compartment
i
found
he
had
had
it
for
some
time
to
himself
we
fared
in
company
and
though
he
had
a
in
his
lap
and
the
open
jaws
of
his
bag
threatened
me
with
the
white
teeth
of
confused
papers
we
inevitably
we
even
at
last
sociably
conversed
i
saw
things
well
with
him
but
i
asked
no
question
till
something
dropped
by
himself
made
as
it
had
made
on
another
occasion
an
absence
of
curiosity
invidious
he
mentioned
that
he
was
worried
about
his
good
old
friend
lady
coxon
who
with
her
niece
likely
to
be
detained
some
time
in
america
lay
seriously
ill
at
clockborough
much
on
his
mind
and
on
his
hands
miss
in
america
father
has
got
into
horrid
lost
no
end
of
i
waited
after
expressing
due
concern
but
i
eventually
said
hope
that
raises
no
objection
to
your
whatever
moreover
my
trade
to
meet
objections
but
it
may
create
tiresome
delays
of
which
there
have
been
too
many
from
various
causes
already
lady
coxon
got
very
bad
then
she
got
much
better
then
anvoy
suddenly
began
to
totter
and
now
he
seems
quite
on
his
back
afraid
really
in
for
some
big
reverse
lady
worse
again
awfully
upset
by
the
news
from
america
and
she
sends
me
word
that
she
have
ruth
how
can
i
supply
her
with
ruth
i
got
ruth
myself
you
lost
her
i
returned
everything
to
her
wretched
father
she
writes
me
every
me
to
smooth
her
pillow
other
things
to
smooth
but
the
old
lady
save
for
her
servants
is
really
alone
she
receive
her
coxon
angry
at
so
much
of
her
money
going
to
them
besides
hopelessly
mad
said
gravener
very
frankly
i
remember
whether
it
was
this
or
what
it
was
that
made
me
ask
if
she
such
an
appreciation
of
saltram
as
might
render
that
active
person
of
some
use
he
gave
me
a
cold
glance
wanting
to
know
what
had
put
saltram
into
my
head
and
i
replied
that
she
was
unfortunately
never
out
of
it
i
happened
to
remember
the
wonderful
accounts
she
had
given
me
of
the
kindness
lady
coxon
had
shown
her
gravener
declared
this
to
be
false
lady
coxon
who
care
for
her
seen
her
three
times
the
only
foundation
for
it
was
that
miss
anvoy
who
used
poor
girl
to
chuck
money
about
in
a
manner
she
must
now
regret
had
for
an
hour
seen
in
the
miserable
could
never
know
what
see
in
interesting
pretext
for
the
liberality
with
which
her
nature
overflowed
but
even
miss
anvoy
was
now
quite
tired
of
her
gravener
told
me
more
about
the
crash
in
new
york
and
the
annoyance
it
had
been
to
him
and
we
also
glanced
here
and
there
in
other
directions
but
by
the
time
we
got
to
doncaster
the
principal
thing
he
had
let
me
see
was
that
he
was
keeping
something
back
we
stopped
at
that
station
and
at
the
some
one
made
a
movement
to
get
in
gravener
uttered
a
sound
of
impatience
and
i
felt
sure
that
but
for
this
i
should
have
had
the
secret
then
the
intruder
for
some
reason
spared
us
his
company
we
started
afresh
and
my
hope
of
a
disclosure
returned
my
companion
held
his
tongue
however
and
i
pretended
to
go
to
sleep
in
fact
i
really
dozed
for
discouragement
when
i
reopened
my
eyes
he
was
looking
at
me
with
an
injured
air
he
tossed
away
with
some
vivacity
the
remnant
of
a
cigarette
and
then
said
not
too
sleepy
i
want
to
put
you
a
i
answered
that
make
every
effort
to
attend
and
welcomed
the
note
of
interest
when
he
went
on
i
told
you
a
while
ago
lady
coxon
poor
dear
is
his
tone
had
much
behind
full
of
promise
i
asked
if
her
misfortune
were
a
trait
of
her
malady
or
only
of
her
character
and
he
pronounced
it
a
product
of
both
the
case
he
wanted
to
put
to
me
was
a
matter
on
which
it
concerned
him
to
have
the
judgement
he
might
also
another
person
mean
of
the
average
intelligent
man
but
you
see
i
take
what
i
can
there
would
be
the
technical
the
strictly
legal
view
then
there
would
be
the
way
the
question
would
strike
a
man
of
the
world
he
had
lighted
another
cigarette
while
he
talked
and
i
saw
he
was
glad
to
have
it
to
handle
when
he
brought
out
at
last
with
a
laugh
slightly
artificial
fact
a
subject
on
which
miss
anvoy
and
i
are
pulling
different
you
want
me
to
decide
between
you
i
decide
in
advance
for
miss
quite
right
how
i
decided
when
i
proposed
to
her
but
my
story
will
interest
you
only
so
far
as
your
mind
made
gravener
puffed
his
cigarette
a
minute
and
then
continued
you
familiar
with
the
idea
of
the
endowment
of
research
research
i
was
at
sea
a
moment
give
you
lady
phrase
she
has
it
on
the
wishes
to
earnest
and
seeker
gravener
said
was
a
sketchy
design
of
her
late
and
he
handed
it
on
to
her
setting
apart
in
his
will
a
sum
of
money
of
which
she
was
to
enjoy
the
interest
for
life
but
of
which
should
she
eventually
see
her
matter
was
left
largely
to
her
would
best
honour
his
memory
by
determining
the
exemplary
public
use
this
sum
of
money
no
less
than
thirteen
thousand
pounds
was
to
be
called
the
coxon
fund
and
poor
sir
gregory
evidently
proposed
to
himself
that
the
coxon
fund
should
cover
his
name
with
universally
desired
and
admired
he
left
his
wife
a
full
declaration
of
his
views
so
far
at
least
as
that
term
may
be
applied
to
views
vitiated
by
a
vagueness
really
infantine
a
little
a
dangerous
thing
and
a
good
citizen
who
happens
to
have
been
an
ass
is
worse
for
a
community
than
bad
sewerage
worst
of
all
when
dead
because
then
he
be
stopped
however
such
as
they
were
the
poor
aspirations
are
now
in
his
bosom
or
fermenting
rather
in
her
foolish
brain
it
lies
with
her
to
carry
them
out
but
of
course
she
must
first
catch
her
earnest
loyal
seeker
flower
that
blushes
unseen
for
want
of
such
a
pecuniary
independence
as
may
aid
the
light
in
it
to
shine
upon
the
human
race
the
individual
in
a
word
who
having
the
rest
of
the
machinery
the
spiritual
the
intellectual
is
most
hampered
in
his
search
for
what
moral
truth
what
sir
gregory
calls
i
burst
out
laughing
munificent
sir
gregory
a
charming
miss
anvoy
she
a
candidate
for
the
fund
that
i
know
perfectly
reasonable
about
it
but
lady
coxon
has
put
the
matter
before
her
and
naturally
had
a
lot
of
that
as
so
interestingly
intimated
has
landed
you
in
a
considers
something
in
it
gravener
said
you
consider
nothing
seems
to
me
a
piece
of
solemn
fail
to
be
attended
with
consequences
certainly
grotesque
and
possibly
immoral
to
begin
with
fancy
constituting
an
endowment
without
establishing
a
bench
of
competent
people
of
sole
tribunal
is
lady
coxon
any
one
she
chooses
to
she
has
invited
you
i
noted
not
hate
the
thing
besides
she
my
friend
went
on
real
history
of
the
matter
i
take
it
is
that
the
inspiration
was
originally
lady
own
that
she
infected
him
with
it
and
that
the
flattering
option
left
her
is
simply
his
tribute
to
her
beautiful
her
aboriginal
enthusiasm
she
came
to
england
forty
years
ago
a
thin
transcendental
bostonian
and
even
her
odd
happy
frumpy
clockborough
marriage
never
really
materialised
her
she
feels
indeed
that
she
has
become
very
if
that
as
a
process
as
a
as
anything
but
an
original
sign
of
grace
were
conceivable
but
precisely
what
makes
her
cling
to
the
notion
of
the
to
it
as
to
a
link
with
the
can
she
cling
if
dying
you
mean
how
can
she
act
in
the
matter
gravener
asked
precisely
the
question
she
as
she
has
never
yet
caught
her
hare
never
spied
out
her
lucky
should
she
with
the
life
she
has
led
intention
has
come
very
near
lapsing
his
idea
to
do
him
justice
was
that
it
lapse
if
exactly
the
right
person
the
perfect
mixture
of
genius
and
chill
penury
should
fail
to
turn
up
ah
the
poor
dear
very
says
there
must
be
no
i
found
all
this
quite
took
it
in
with
avidity
if
she
dies
without
doing
anything
what
becomes
of
the
money
i
demanded
goes
back
to
his
family
if
she
made
some
other
disposition
of
may
do
that
may
divert
it
hands
are
not
tied
she
has
a
grand
discretion
the
proof
is
that
three
months
ago
she
offered
to
make
the
proceeds
over
to
her
miss
own
use
miss
own
the
occasion
of
her
prospective
marriage
she
was
earnest
seeker
required
so
earnest
a
search
she
was
afraid
of
making
a
mistake
every
one
she
could
think
of
seemed
either
not
earnest
enough
or
not
poor
enough
on
the
receipt
of
the
first
bad
news
about
affairs
she
proposed
to
ruth
to
make
the
sacrifice
for
her
as
the
situation
in
new
york
got
worse
she
repeated
her
miss
anvoy
declined
as
a
formal
mean
except
as
committing
herself
legally
to
place
the
money
the
head
of
the
deserving
object
the
great
man
frustrated
said
gravener
only
consents
to
act
in
the
spirit
of
sir
you
blame
her
for
that
i
asked
with
some
intensity
my
tone
have
been
harsh
but
he
coloured
a
little
and
there
was
a
queer
light
in
his
eye
dear
fellow
if
i
the
young
lady
engaged
to
i
immediately
say
it
even
to
so
old
a
friend
as
i
saw
that
some
deep
discomfort
some
restless
desire
to
be
sided
with
reassuringly
approvingly
mirrored
had
been
at
the
bottom
of
his
drifting
so
far
and
i
was
genuinely
touched
by
his
confidence
it
was
inconsistent
with
his
habits
but
being
troubled
about
a
woman
was
not
for
him
a
habit
that
itself
was
an
inconsistency
george
gravener
could
stand
straight
enough
before
any
other
combination
of
forces
it
amused
me
to
think
that
the
combination
he
had
succumbed
to
had
an
american
accent
a
transcendental
aunt
and
an
insolvent
father
but
all
my
old
loyalty
to
him
mustered
to
meet
this
unexpected
hint
that
i
could
help
him
i
saw
that
i
could
from
the
insincere
tone
in
which
he
pursued
criticised
her
of
course
contended
with
her
and
it
has
been
great
yet
it
clearly
have
been
such
great
fun
as
to
make
it
improper
for
me
presently
to
ask
if
miss
anvoy
had
nothing
at
all
settled
on
herself
to
this
he
replied
that
she
had
only
a
trifle
from
her
mere
four
hundred
a
year
which
was
exactly
why
it
would
be
convenient
to
him
that
she
decline
in
the
face
of
this
total
change
in
her
prospects
an
accession
of
income
which
would
distinctly
help
them
to
marry
when
i
enquired
if
there
were
no
other
way
in
which
so
rich
and
so
affectionate
an
aunt
could
cause
the
weight
of
her
benevolence
to
be
felt
he
answered
that
lady
coxon
was
affectionate
indeed
but
was
scarcely
to
be
called
rich
she
could
let
her
project
of
the
fund
lapse
for
her
benefit
but
she
do
anything
else
she
had
been
accustomed
to
regard
her
as
tremendously
provided
for
and
she
was
up
to
her
eyes
in
promises
to
anxious
coxons
she
was
a
woman
of
an
inordinate
conscience
and
her
conscience
was
now
a
distress
to
her
hovering
round
her
bed
in
irreconcilable
forms
of
resentful
husbands
portionless
nieces
and
undiscoverable
philosophers
we
were
by
this
time
getting
into
the
whirr
of
fleeting
platforms
the
multiplication
of
lights
think
find
i
said
with
a
laugh
your
predicament
will
disappear
in
the
very
fact
that
the
philosopher
he
began
to
gather
up
his
papers
can
set
a
limit
to
the
ingenuity
of
an
extravagant
woman
after
all
who
indeed
i
echoed
as
i
recalled
the
extravagance
commemorated
in
anecdote
of
miss
anvoy
and
the
thirty
pounds
ix
the
thing
i
had
been
most
sensible
of
in
that
talk
with
george
gravener
was
the
way
name
kept
out
of
it
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
that
we
were
quite
pointedly
silent
about
him
but
afterwards
it
appeared
more
probable
there
had
been
on
my
part
no
conscious
avoidance
later
on
i
was
sure
of
this
and
for
the
best
of
simple
reason
of
my
perceiving
more
completely
that
for
evil
as
well
as
for
good
he
said
nothing
to
imagination
that
honest
man
fear
was
too
much
disgusted
with
him
no
more
did
i
doubtless
and
for
very
much
the
same
reason
i
treated
my
story
as
an
absolute
confidence
but
when
before
christmas
by
saltram
i
was
informed
of
lady
death
without
having
had
news
of
miss
return
i
found
myself
taking
for
granted
we
should
hear
no
more
of
these
nuptials
in
which
as
obscurely
unnatural
i
now
saw
i
had
never
disconcertedly
believed
i
began
to
ask
myself
how
people
who
suited
each
other
so
little
could
please
each
other
so
much
the
charm
was
some
material
charm
some
afffinity
exquisite
doubtless
yet
superficial
some
surrender
to
youth
and
beauty
and
passion
to
force
and
grace
and
fortune
happy
accidents
and
easy
contacts
they
might
dote
on
each
persons
but
how
could
they
know
each
souls
how
could
they
have
the
same
prejudices
how
could
they
have
the
same
horizon
such
questions
i
confess
seemed
quenched
but
not
answered
when
one
day
in
february
going
out
to
wimbledon
i
found
our
young
lady
in
the
house
a
passion
that
had
brought
her
back
across
the
wintry
ocean
was
as
much
of
a
passion
as
was
needed
no
impulse
equally
strong
indeed
had
drawn
george
gravener
to
america
a
circumstance
on
which
however
i
reflected
only
long
enough
to
remind
myself
that
it
was
none
of
my
business
ruth
anvoy
was
distinctly
different
and
i
felt
that
the
difference
was
not
simply
that
of
her
marks
of
mourning
mulville
told
me
soon
enough
what
it
was
it
was
the
difference
between
a
handsome
girl
with
large
expectations
and
a
handsome
girl
with
only
four
hundred
a
year
this
explanation
indeed
wholly
content
me
not
even
when
i
learned
that
her
mourning
had
a
double
that
poor
anvoy
giving
way
altogether
buried
under
the
ruins
of
his
fortune
and
leaving
next
to
nothing
had
died
a
few
weeks
before
she
has
come
out
to
marry
george
gravener
i
commented
it
have
been
prettier
of
him
to
have
saved
her
the
trouble
the
house
just
met
adelaide
replied
for
gravener
the
then
she
added
gather
that
her
having
come
is
exactly
a
sign
that
the
marriage
is
a
little
shaky
if
it
were
quite
all
right
a
girl
like
ruth
would
have
waited
for
him
over
i
noted
that
they
were
already
ruth
and
adelaide
but
what
i
said
was
you
mean
have
had
to
return
to
it
so
i
mean
that
she
must
have
come
out
for
some
reason
independent
of
adelaide
could
only
surmise
however
as
yet
and
there
was
more
as
we
found
to
be
revealed
mulville
on
hearing
of
her
arrival
had
brought
the
young
lady
out
in
the
green
landau
for
the
sunday
the
coxons
were
in
possession
of
the
house
in
park
and
miss
anvoy
was
in
dreary
lodgings
george
gravener
had
been
with
her
when
adelaide
called
but
had
assented
graciously
enough
to
the
little
visit
at
wimbledon
the
carriage
with
saltram
in
it
but
not
mentioned
had
been
sent
off
on
some
errand
from
which
it
was
to
return
and
pick
the
ladies
up
gravener
had
left
them
together
and
at
the
end
of
an
hour
on
the
saturday
afternoon
the
party
of
three
had
driven
out
to
wimbledon
this
was
the
second
glimpse
of
our
great
man
and
i
was
interested
in
asking
mulville
if
the
impression
made
by
the
first
appeared
to
have
been
confirmed
on
her
replying
after
consideration
that
of
course
with
time
and
opportunity
it
fail
to
be
but
that
she
was
disappointed
i
was
sufficiently
struck
with
her
use
of
this
last
word
to
question
her
further
you
mean
disappointed
because
you
judge
miss
anvoy
to
be
i
hoped
for
a
greater
effect
last
evening
we
had
two
or
three
people
but
he
scarcely
opened
his
be
all
the
better
i
opined
after
a
moment
then
i
pursued
particular
importance
do
you
attach
to
the
idea
of
her
being
impressed
adelaide
turned
her
mild
pale
eyes
on
me
as
for
rebuke
of
my
levity
the
importance
of
her
being
as
happy
as
are
afraid
that
at
this
my
levity
grew
a
happiness
almost
too
great
to
wish
a
person
i
saw
she
yet
in
her
mind
what
i
had
in
mine
and
at
any
rate
the
actual
bliss
was
limited
to
a
walk
in
the
garden
with
kent
mulville
later
in
the
afternoon
i
also
took
one
and
i
saw
nothing
of
miss
anvoy
till
dinner
at
which
we
failed
of
the
company
of
saltram
who
had
caused
it
to
be
reported
that
he
was
indisposed
and
lying
down
this
made
us
most
of
there
were
other
friends
to
each
other
in
silence
some
of
the
unutterable
things
that
in
those
years
our
eyes
had
inevitably
acquired
the
art
of
expressing
if
a
fine
little
american
enquirer
been
there
we
would
have
expressed
them
otherwise
and
adelaide
would
have
pretended
not
to
hear
i
had
seen
her
before
the
very
fact
abstract
herself
nobly
and
i
knew
that
more
than
once
to
keep
it
from
the
servants
managing
dissimulating
cleverly
she
had
helped
her
husband
to
carry
him
bodily
to
his
room
just
recently
he
had
been
so
wise
and
so
deep
and
so
high
that
i
had
begun
to
get
wonder
if
by
chance
there
were
something
behind
it
if
he
were
kept
straight
for
instance
by
the
knowledge
that
the
hated
pudneys
would
have
more
to
tell
us
if
they
chose
he
was
lying
low
but
unfortunately
it
was
common
wisdom
with
us
in
this
connexion
that
the
biggest
splashes
took
place
in
the
quietest
pools
we
should
have
had
a
merry
life
indeed
if
all
the
splashes
had
sprinkled
us
as
refreshingly
as
the
waters
we
were
even
then
to
feel
about
our
ears
kent
mulville
had
been
up
to
his
room
but
had
come
back
with
a
face
that
told
as
few
tales
as
i
had
seen
it
succeed
in
telling
on
the
evening
i
waited
in
the
with
miss
anvoy
i
said
to
myself
that
our
friend
had
gone
out
but
it
was
a
comfort
that
the
presence
of
a
comparative
stranger
deprived
us
of
the
dreary
duty
of
suggesting
to
each
other
in
respect
of
his
errand
edifying
possibilities
in
which
we
ourselves
believe
at
ten
he
came
into
the
with
his
waistcoat
much
awry
but
his
eyes
sending
out
great
signals
it
was
precisely
with
his
entrance
that
i
ceased
to
be
vividly
conscious
of
him
i
saw
that
the
crystal
as
i
had
called
it
had
begun
to
swing
and
i
had
need
of
my
immediate
attention
for
miss
anvoy
even
when
i
was
told
afterwards
that
he
had
as
we
might
have
said
broken
the
record
the
manner
in
which
that
attention
had
been
rewarded
relieved
me
of
a
sense
of
loss
i
had
of
course
a
perfect
general
consciousness
that
something
great
was
going
on
it
was
a
little
like
having
been
etherised
to
hear
herr
joachim
play
the
old
music
was
in
the
air
i
felt
the
strong
pulse
of
thought
the
sink
and
swell
the
flight
the
poise
the
plunge
but
i
knew
something
about
one
of
the
listeners
that
nobody
else
knew
and
monologue
could
reach
me
only
through
that
medium
to
this
hour
of
no
use
when
as
a
witness
appealed
they
still
absurdly
contend
about
to
whether
or
no
on
that
historic
night
he
was
drunk
and
my
position
is
slightly
ridiculous
for
never
cared
to
tell
them
what
it
really
was
i
was
taken
up
with
what
i
got
out
of
it
is
the
only
morsel
of
the
total
experience
that
is
quite
my
own
the
others
were
shared
but
this
is
incommunicable
i
feel
that
now
bound
to
say
even
in
thus
roughly
evoking
the
occasion
and
it
takes
something
from
my
pride
of
clearness
however
i
shall
perhaps
be
as
clear
as
is
absolutely
needful
if
i
remark
that
our
young
lady
was
too
much
given
up
to
her
own
intensity
of
observation
to
be
sensible
of
mine
it
was
plainly
not
the
question
of
her
marriage
that
had
brought
her
back
i
greatly
enjoyed
this
discovery
and
was
sure
that
had
that
question
alone
been
involved
she
would
have
stirred
no
step
in
this
case
doubtless
gravener
would
in
spite
of
the
house
of
commons
have
found
means
to
rejoin
her
it
afterwards
made
me
uncomfortable
for
her
that
alone
in
the
lodging
mulville
had
put
before
me
as
dreary
she
should
have
in
any
degree
the
air
of
waiting
for
her
fate
so
that
i
was
presently
relieved
at
hearing
of
her
having
gone
to
stay
at
coldfield
if
she
was
in
england
at
all
while
the
engagement
stood
the
only
proper
place
for
her
was
under
lady
wing
now
that
she
was
unfortunate
and
relatively
poor
perhaps
her
prospective
would
be
wholly
won
over
there
would
be
much
to
say
if
i
had
space
about
the
way
her
behaviour
as
i
caught
gleams
of
it
ministered
to
the
image
that
had
taken
birth
in
my
mind
to
my
private
amusement
while
that
other
night
i
listened
to
george
gravener
in
the
i
watched
her
in
the
light
of
this
queer
formidable
thing
certainly
to
i
was
aware
that
it
coloured
extravagantly
perhaps
my
interpretation
of
her
very
looks
and
tones
at
wimbledon
for
instance
it
had
appeared
to
me
she
was
literally
afraid
of
saltram
in
dread
of
a
coercion
that
she
had
begun
already
to
feel
i
had
come
up
to
town
with
her
the
next
day
and
had
been
convinced
that
though
deeply
interested
she
was
immensely
on
her
guard
she
would
show
as
little
as
possible
before
she
should
be
ready
to
show
everything
what
this
final
exhibition
might
be
on
the
part
of
a
girl
perceptibly
so
able
to
think
things
out
i
found
it
great
sport
to
forecast
it
would
have
been
exciting
to
be
approached
by
her
appealed
to
by
her
for
advice
but
i
prayed
to
heaven
i
find
myself
in
such
a
predicament
if
there
was
really
a
present
rigour
in
the
situation
of
which
gravener
had
sketched
for
me
the
elements
she
would
have
to
get
out
of
her
difficulty
by
herself
it
i
who
had
launched
her
and
it
i
who
could
help
her
i
fail
to
ask
myself
why
since
i
help
her
i
should
think
so
much
about
her
it
was
in
part
my
suspense
that
was
responsible
for
this
i
waited
impatiently
to
see
whether
she
have
told
mulville
a
portion
at
least
of
what
i
had
learned
from
gravener
but
i
saw
mulville
was
still
reduced
to
wonder
what
she
had
come
out
again
for
if
she
come
as
a
conciliatory
bride
that
she
had
come
in
some
other
character
was
the
only
thing
that
fitted
all
the
appearances
having
for
family
reasons
to
spend
some
time
that
spring
in
the
west
of
england
i
was
in
a
manner
out
of
earshot
of
the
great
oceanic
mean
of
the
continuous
hum
of
my
uneasiness
tended
to
keep
me
quiet
there
was
something
i
wanted
so
little
to
have
to
say
that
my
prudence
surmounted
my
curiosity
i
only
wondered
if
ruth
anvoy
talked
over
the
idea
of
the
coxon
fund
with
lady
maddock
and
also
somewhat
why
i
hear
from
wimbledon
i
had
a
reproachful
note
about
something
or
other
from
saltram
but
it
contained
no
mention
of
lady
niece
on
whom
her
eyes
had
been
much
less
fixed
since
the
recent
untoward
events
x
poor
silence
was
fully
explained
explained
when
in
june
returning
to
london
i
was
honoured
by
this
admirable
woman
with
an
early
visit
as
soon
as
she
arrived
i
guessed
everything
and
as
soon
as
she
told
me
that
darling
ruth
had
been
in
her
house
nearly
a
month
i
had
my
question
ready
in
the
name
of
maidenly
modesty
is
she
staying
in
england
for
she
loves
me
so
cried
adelaide
gaily
but
she
come
to
see
me
only
to
tell
me
miss
anvoy
loved
her
that
was
quite
sufficiently
established
and
what
was
much
more
to
the
point
was
that
gravener
had
now
raised
an
objection
to
it
he
had
protested
at
least
against
her
being
at
wimbledon
where
in
the
innocence
of
his
heart
he
had
originally
brought
her
himself
he
called
on
her
to
put
an
end
to
their
engagement
in
the
only
proper
the
only
happy
manner
why
in
the
world
she
do
do
i
asked
adelaide
had
a
pause
says
you
then
on
my
also
hesitating
she
added
condition
he
coxon
fund
i
panted
has
mentioned
to
her
his
having
told
you
about
but
so
little
do
you
mean
she
has
accepted
the
trust
the
most
splendid
a
duty
about
which
there
can
be
no
two
to
which
my
friend
added
course
thinking
of
i
gave
a
quick
cry
at
this
which
in
its
violence
made
my
visitor
turn
pale
very
awful
to
have
anything
to
do
with
such
an
idea
sure
and
mulville
tossed
her
head
good
enough
i
went
on
to
which
she
opposed
a
sound
almost
as
contentious
as
my
own
had
been
this
made
me
with
genuine
immediate
horror
exclaim
influenced
her
i
hope
and
my
emphasis
brought
back
the
blood
with
a
rush
to
poor
face
she
declared
while
she
i
had
frightened
her
she
had
never
influenced
anybody
and
that
the
girl
had
only
seen
and
heard
and
judged
for
herself
had
influenced
her
if
i
would
as
he
did
every
one
who
had
a
soul
that
word
as
we
knew
even
expressed
feebly
the
power
of
the
things
he
said
to
haunt
the
mind
how
could
she
adelaide
help
it
if
miss
mind
was
haunted
i
demanded
with
a
groan
what
right
a
pretty
girl
engaged
to
a
rising
had
to
a
mind
but
the
only
explanation
my
bewildered
friend
could
give
me
was
that
she
was
so
clever
she
regarded
saltram
naturally
as
a
tremendous
force
for
good
she
was
intelligent
enough
to
understand
him
and
generous
enough
to
admire
many
things
enough
but
is
she
among
them
rich
enough
i
demanded
enough
i
mean
to
sacrifice
such
a
lot
of
good
money
for
herself
to
judge
besides
not
her
own
money
she
in
the
least
consider
it
gravener
does
if
not
own
and
the
whole
difficulty
difficulty
that
brought
her
back
yes
she
had
absolutely
to
see
her
poor
solicitor
clear
that
by
lady
will
she
may
have
the
money
but
still
clearer
to
her
conscience
that
the
original
condition
definite
intensely
implied
on
her
part
is
attached
to
the
use
of
it
she
can
only
take
one
view
of
it
for
the
endowment
or
for
endowment
i
permitted
myself
to
observe
a
conception
superficially
sublime
but
fundamentally
you
repeating
words
adelaide
asked
though
not
seen
him
for
months
simply
the
way
it
strikes
me
too
an
old
tale
gravener
made
some
reference
to
the
legal
aspect
but
such
an
absurdly
loose
arrangement
has
legal
insist
on
that
said
mulville
for
her
exactly
this
technical
weakness
that
constitutes
the
force
of
the
moral
you
repeating
words
i
enquired
i
forget
what
else
adelaide
said
but
she
said
she
was
magnificent
i
thought
of
george
gravener
confronted
with
such
magnificence
as
that
and
i
asked
what
could
have
made
two
such
persons
ever
suppose
they
understood
each
other
mulville
assured
me
the
girl
loved
him
as
such
a
woman
could
love
and
that
she
suffered
as
such
a
woman
could
suffer
nevertheless
she
wanted
to
see
at
this
i
sprang
up
with
a
groan
so
sorry
small
though
her
sense
of
humour
i
think
adelaide
laughed
at
my
sequence
we
discussed
the
day
the
nearest
it
would
be
convenient
i
should
come
out
but
before
she
went
i
asked
my
visitor
how
long
she
had
been
acquainted
with
these
prodigies
several
weeks
but
i
was
pledged
to
why
you
write
very
well
tell
you
she
was
with
me
without
telling
you
that
no
time
had
even
yet
been
fixed
for
her
marriage
and
i
very
well
tell
you
as
much
as
that
without
telling
you
what
i
knew
of
the
reason
of
it
it
was
not
till
a
day
or
two
ago
mulville
went
on
she
asked
me
to
ask
you
if
you
come
and
see
her
then
at
last
she
spoke
of
your
knowing
about
the
idea
of
the
i
turned
this
over
on
earth
does
she
want
to
see
me
talk
with
you
naturally
about
a
subject
for
the
prize
this
was
hugely
obvious
and
i
presently
returned
think
sail
for
said
mulville
getting
up
but
i
frivolously
continued
thursday
at
five
we
said
the
appointment
was
made
definite
and
i
enquired
how
all
this
time
the
unconscious
candidate
had
carried
himself
perfection
really
by
the
happiest
of
chances
he
has
positively
been
a
dear
and
then
as
to
what
we
revere
him
for
in
the
most
wonderful
form
his
very
celestial
light
you
do
him
an
ill
turn
adelaide
pleaded
at
the
door
danger
can
equal
for
him
the
danger
to
which
exposed
from
himself
i
asked
out
sharp
if
he
has
lately
been
too
prim
presently
take
a
day
off
treat
us
to
some
exhibition
that
will
make
an
endowment
a
scandal
mulville
dolorously
echoed
miss
anvoy
prepared
for
that
my
visitor
for
a
moment
screwed
her
parasol
into
my
carpet
grows
bigger
every
do
you
i
laughed
as
she
went
off
that
girl
at
wimbledon
on
the
thursday
afternoon
more
than
justified
my
apprehensions
i
recognised
fully
now
the
cause
of
the
agitation
she
had
produced
in
me
from
the
faint
foreknowledge
that
there
was
something
very
stiff
i
should
have
to
do
for
her
i
felt
more
than
ever
committed
to
my
fate
as
standing
before
her
in
the
big
where
they
had
tactfully
left
us
to
ourselves
i
tried
with
a
smile
to
string
together
the
pearls
of
lucidity
which
from
her
chair
she
successively
tossed
me
pale
and
bright
in
her
monotonous
mourning
she
was
an
image
of
intelligent
purpose
of
the
passion
of
duty
but
i
asked
myself
whether
any
girl
had
ever
had
so
charming
an
instinct
as
that
which
permitted
her
to
laugh
out
as
for
the
joy
of
her
difficulty
into
the
priggish
old
room
this
remarkable
young
woman
could
be
earnest
without
being
solemn
and
at
moments
when
i
ought
doubtless
to
have
cursed
her
obstinacy
i
found
myself
watching
the
unstudied
play
of
her
eyebrows
or
the
recurrence
of
a
singularly
intense
whiteness
produced
by
the
parting
of
her
lips
these
aberrations
i
hasten
to
add
prevent
my
learning
soon
enough
why
she
had
wished
to
see
me
her
reason
for
this
was
as
distinct
as
her
beauty
it
was
to
make
me
explain
what
i
had
meant
on
the
occasion
of
our
first
meeting
by
want
of
dignity
it
that
she
imagine
but
she
desired
it
there
from
my
lips
what
she
really
desired
of
course
was
to
know
whether
there
was
worse
about
him
than
what
she
had
found
out
for
herself
she
been
a
month
so
much
in
the
house
with
him
without
discovering
that
he
a
man
of
monumental
bronze
he
was
like
a
jelly
minus
its
mould
he
had
to
be
embanked
and
that
was
precisely
the
source
of
her
interest
in
him
and
the
ground
of
her
project
she
put
her
project
boldly
before
me
there
it
stood
in
its
preposterous
beauty
she
was
as
willing
to
take
the
humorous
view
of
it
as
i
could
be
the
only
difference
was
that
for
her
the
humorous
view
of
a
thing
necessarily
prohibitive
paralysing
moreover
she
professed
that
she
discuss
with
me
the
primary
moral
obligation
that
was
in
her
own
breast
there
were
things
she
go
impressions
she
had
received
they
were
a
part
of
the
closest
intimacy
of
her
intercourse
with
her
aunt
they
were
absolutely
clear
to
her
and
on
questions
of
delicacy
the
interpretation
of
a
fidelity
of
a
promise
one
had
always
in
the
last
resort
to
make
up
mind
for
self
it
was
the
idea
of
the
application
to
the
particular
case
such
a
splendid
one
at
last
that
troubled
her
and
she
admitted
that
it
stirred
very
deep
things
she
pretend
that
such
a
responsibility
was
a
simple
matter
if
it
been
she
have
attempted
to
saddle
me
with
any
portion
of
it
the
mulvilles
were
sympathy
itself
but
were
they
absolutely
candid
could
they
indeed
be
in
their
it
even
have
been
to
be
desired
yes
she
had
sent
for
me
to
ask
no
less
than
that
of
there
was
anything
dreadful
kept
back
she
made
no
allusion
whatever
to
george
thought
her
silence
the
only
good
taste
and
her
gaiety
perhaps
a
part
of
the
very
anxiety
of
that
discretion
the
effect
of
a
determination
that
people
know
from
herself
that
her
relations
with
the
man
she
was
to
marry
were
strained
all
the
weight
however
that
she
left
me
to
throw
was
a
sufficient
implication
of
the
weight
had
thrown
in
vain
oh
she
knew
the
question
of
character
was
immense
and
that
one
entertain
any
plan
for
making
merit
comfortable
without
running
the
gauntlet
of
that
terrible
procession
of
which
like
a
young
school
out
for
a
walk
hooked
their
uniform
noses
at
the
tail
of
governess
conduct
but
were
we
absolutely
to
hold
that
there
was
never
never
never
an
exception
never
never
never
an
occasion
for
liberal
acceptance
for
clever
charity
for
suspended
letting
one
side
in
short
outbalance
another
when
miss
anvoy
threw
off
this
appeal
i
could
have
embraced
her
for
so
delightfully
emphasising
her
unlikeness
to
saltram
not
have
the
courage
of
forgiveness
she
asked
well
as
the
enthusiasm
of
adhesion
how
wonderfully
threshed
the
whole
thing
out
i
evasively
replied
me
an
extraordinary
notion
of
the
point
your
enthusiasm
has
she
considered
this
remark
an
instant
with
her
eyes
on
mine
and
i
divined
that
it
struck
her
i
might
possibly
intend
it
as
a
reference
to
some
personal
subjection
to
our
fat
philosopher
to
some
aberration
of
sensibility
some
perversion
of
taste
at
least
i
interpret
otherwise
the
sudden
flash
that
came
into
her
face
such
a
manifestation
as
the
result
of
any
word
of
mine
embarrassed
me
but
while
i
was
thinking
how
to
reassure
her
the
flush
passed
away
in
a
smile
of
exquisite
good
nature
you
see
one
forgets
so
wonderfully
how
one
dislikes
him
she
said
and
if
her
tone
simply
extinguished
his
strange
figure
with
the
brush
of
its
compassion
it
also
rings
in
my
ear
as
the
purest
of
all
our
praises
but
with
what
quick
response
of
fine
pity
such
a
relegation
of
the
man
himself
made
me
privately
sigh
poor
saltram
she
instantly
with
this
took
the
measure
of
all
i
believe
and
it
enabled
her
to
go
on
can
one
do
when
a
person
has
given
such
a
lift
to
interest
in
life
what
can
one
do
if
i
struck
her
as
a
little
vague
it
was
because
i
was
thinking
of
another
person
i
indulged
in
another
inarticulate
george
gravener
what
had
become
of
the
lift
had
given
that
interest
later
on
i
made
up
my
mind
that
she
was
sore
and
stricken
at
the
appearance
he
presented
of
wanting
the
miserable
money
this
was
the
hidden
reason
of
her
alienation
the
probable
sincerity
in
spite
of
the
illiberality
of
his
scruples
about
the
particular
use
of
it
under
discussion
efface
the
ugliness
of
his
demand
that
they
should
buy
a
good
house
with
it
then
as
for
alienation
he
pardonably
enough
grasp
the
lift
frank
saltram
had
given
her
interest
in
life
if
a
mere
spectator
could
ask
that
last
question
with
what
rage
in
his
heart
the
man
himself
might
he
like
her
i
was
to
see
too
proud
to
show
me
why
he
was
disappointed
xi
i
was
unable
this
time
to
stay
to
dinner
such
at
any
rate
was
the
plea
on
which
i
took
leave
i
desired
in
truth
to
get
away
from
my
young
lady
for
that
obviously
helped
me
not
to
pretend
to
satisfy
her
how
i
satisfy
her
i
asked
could
i
tell
her
how
much
had
been
kept
back
i
even
know
and
i
certainly
desire
to
know
my
own
policy
had
ever
been
to
learn
the
least
about
poor
to
learn
the
most
a
great
deal
that
i
had
in
fact
learned
had
been
forced
upon
me
by
his
wife
there
was
something
even
irritating
in
miss
crude
conscientiousness
and
i
wondered
why
after
all
she
have
let
him
alone
and
been
content
to
entrust
george
gravener
with
the
purchase
of
the
good
house
i
was
sure
he
would
have
driven
a
bargain
got
something
excellent
and
cheap
i
laughed
louder
even
than
she
i
temporised
i
failed
her
i
told
her
i
must
think
over
her
case
i
professed
a
horror
of
responsibilities
and
twitted
her
with
her
own
extravagant
passion
for
them
it
really
that
i
was
afraid
of
the
scandal
the
moral
discredit
for
the
fund
what
troubled
me
most
was
a
feeling
of
a
different
order
of
course
as
the
beneficiary
of
the
fund
was
to
enjoy
a
simple
as
it
was
hoped
that
new
beneficiaries
would
arise
and
come
up
to
new
standards
it
be
a
trifle
that
the
first
of
these
worthies
have
been
a
striking
example
of
the
domestic
virtues
the
fund
would
start
badly
as
it
were
and
the
laurel
would
in
some
respects
at
least
scarcely
be
greener
from
the
brows
of
the
original
wearer
that
idea
however
was
at
that
hour
as
i
have
hinted
not
the
source
of
solicitude
it
ought
perhaps
to
have
been
for
i
felt
less
the
irregularity
of
getting
the
money
than
that
of
this
exalted
young
giving
it
up
i
wanted
her
to
have
it
for
herself
and
i
told
her
so
before
i
went
away
she
looked
graver
at
this
than
she
had
looked
at
all
saying
she
hoped
such
a
preference
make
me
dishonest
it
made
me
to
begin
with
very
me
instead
of
going
straight
to
the
station
fidget
a
little
about
that
common
which
gives
wimbledon
horizons
there
was
a
worry
for
me
to
work
off
or
rather
keep
at
a
distance
for
i
declined
even
to
admit
to
myself
that
i
had
in
miss
phrase
been
saddled
with
it
what
could
have
been
clearer
indeed
than
the
attitude
of
recognising
perfectly
what
a
world
of
trouble
the
coxon
fund
would
in
future
save
us
and
of
yet
liking
better
to
face
a
continuance
of
that
trouble
than
see
and
in
fact
contribute
to
a
deviation
from
attainable
bliss
in
the
life
of
two
other
persons
in
whom
i
was
deeply
interested
suddenly
at
the
end
of
twenty
minutes
there
was
projected
across
this
clearness
the
image
of
a
massive
man
seated
on
a
bench
under
a
tree
with
sad
eyes
and
plump
white
hands
folded
on
the
head
of
a
stick
i
recognised
a
stout
staff
that
i
had
given
him
in
devoted
days
i
stopped
short
as
he
turned
his
face
to
me
and
it
happened
that
for
some
reason
or
other
i
took
in
as
i
had
perhaps
never
done
before
the
beauty
of
his
rich
blank
gaze
it
was
charged
with
experience
as
the
sky
is
charged
with
light
and
i
felt
on
the
instant
as
if
we
had
been
overspanned
and
conjoined
by
the
great
arch
of
a
bridge
or
the
great
dome
of
a
temple
doubtless
i
was
rendered
peculiarly
sensitive
to
it
by
something
in
the
way
i
had
been
giving
him
up
and
sinking
him
while
i
met
it
i
stood
there
smitten
and
i
felt
myself
responding
to
it
with
a
sort
of
guilty
grimace
this
brought
back
his
attention
in
a
smile
which
expressed
for
me
a
cheerful
weary
patience
a
bruised
noble
gentleness
i
had
told
miss
anvoy
that
he
had
no
dignity
but
what
did
he
seem
to
me
all
unbuttoned
and
fatigued
as
he
waited
for
me
to
come
up
if
he
seem
unconcerned
with
small
things
seem
in
short
majestic
there
was
majesty
in
his
mere
unconsciousness
of
our
little
conferences
and
puzzlements
over
his
maintenance
and
his
reward
after
i
had
sat
by
him
a
few
minutes
i
passed
my
arm
over
his
big
soft
you
touched
him
you
found
equally
little
said
in
a
tone
of
which
the
suppliance
fell
oddly
on
my
own
ear
back
to
town
with
me
old
back
and
spend
the
i
wanted
to
hold
him
i
wanted
to
keep
him
and
at
waterloo
an
hour
later
i
telegraphed
possessively
to
the
mulvilles
when
he
objected
as
regards
staying
all
night
that
he
had
no
things
i
asked
him
if
he
everything
of
mine
i
had
abstained
from
ordering
dinner
and
it
was
too
late
for
preliminaries
at
a
club
so
we
were
reduced
to
tea
and
fried
fish
at
my
also
to
the
transcendent
something
had
come
up
which
made
me
want
him
to
feel
at
peace
with
which
precisely
was
all
the
dear
man
himself
wanted
on
any
occasion
i
had
too
often
had
to
press
upon
him
considerations
irrelevant
but
it
gives
me
pleasure
now
to
think
that
on
that
particular
evening
i
even
mention
saltram
and
the
children
late
into
the
night
we
smoked
and
talked
old
shames
and
old
rigours
fell
away
from
us
i
only
let
him
see
that
i
was
conscious
of
what
i
owed
him
he
was
as
mild
as
contrition
and
as
copious
as
faith
he
was
never
so
fine
as
on
a
shy
return
and
even
better
at
forgiving
than
at
being
forgiven
i
dare
say
it
was
a
smaller
matter
than
that
famous
night
at
wimbledon
the
night
of
the
problematical
sobriety
and
of
miss
initiation
but
i
was
as
much
in
it
on
this
occasion
as
i
had
been
out
of
it
then
at
about
he
was
sublime
he
never
in
whatever
situation
rose
till
all
other
risings
were
over
and
his
breakfasts
at
wimbledon
had
always
been
the
principal
reason
mentioned
by
departing
cooks
the
coast
was
therefore
clear
for
me
to
receive
her
when
early
the
next
morning
to
my
surprise
it
was
announced
to
me
his
wife
had
called
i
hesitated
after
she
had
come
up
about
telling
her
saltram
was
in
the
house
but
she
herself
settled
the
question
kept
me
reticent
by
drawing
forth
a
sealed
letter
which
looking
at
me
very
hard
in
the
eyes
she
placed
with
a
pregnant
absence
of
comment
in
my
hand
for
a
single
moment
there
glimmered
before
me
the
fond
hope
that
saltram
had
tendered
me
as
it
were
her
resignation
and
desired
to
embody
the
act
in
an
unsparing
form
to
bring
this
about
i
would
have
feigned
any
humiliation
but
after
my
eyes
had
caught
the
superscription
i
heard
myself
say
with
a
flatness
that
betrayed
a
sense
of
something
very
different
from
relief
the
pudneys
i
knew
their
envelopes
though
they
know
mine
they
always
used
the
kind
sold
at
with
the
stamp
affixed
and
as
this
letter
been
posted
they
had
wasted
a
penny
on
me
i
had
seen
their
horrid
missives
to
the
mulvilles
but
been
in
direct
correspondence
with
them
enclosed
it
to
me
to
be
delivered
they
doubtless
explain
to
you
that
they
your
i
turned
the
thing
over
without
opening
it
in
the
world
should
they
write
to
me
something
to
tell
you
the
worst
saltram
dryly
added
it
was
another
chapter
i
felt
of
the
history
of
their
lamentable
quarrel
with
her
husband
the
episode
in
which
vindictively
disingenuously
as
they
themselves
had
behaved
one
had
to
admit
that
he
had
put
himself
more
grossly
in
the
wrong
than
at
any
moment
of
his
life
he
had
begun
by
insulting
the
matchless
mulvilles
for
these
more
specious
protectors
and
then
according
to
his
wont
at
the
end
of
a
few
months
had
dug
a
still
deeper
ditch
for
his
aberration
than
the
chasm
left
yawning
behind
the
chasm
at
wimbledon
was
now
blessedly
closed
but
the
pudneys
across
their
persistent
gulf
kept
up
the
nastiest
fire
i
never
doubted
they
had
a
strong
case
and
i
had
been
from
the
first
for
not
defending
that
if
they
contradicted
perhaps
subside
this
was
above
all
what
i
wanted
and
i
so
far
prevailed
that
i
did
arrest
the
correspondence
in
time
to
save
our
little
circle
an
infliction
heavier
than
it
perhaps
would
have
borne
i
knew
that
is
i
divined
that
their
allegations
had
gone
as
yet
only
as
far
as
their
courage
conscious
as
they
were
in
their
own
virtue
of
an
exposed
place
in
which
saltram
could
have
planted
a
blow
it
was
a
question
with
them
whether
a
man
who
had
himself
so
much
to
cover
up
would
dare
his
blow
so
that
these
vessels
of
rancour
were
in
a
manner
afraid
of
each
other
i
judged
that
on
the
day
the
pudneys
should
cease
for
some
reason
or
other
to
be
afraid
they
would
treat
us
to
some
revelation
more
disconcerting
than
any
of
its
predecessors
as
i
held
letter
in
my
hand
it
was
distinctly
communicated
to
me
that
the
day
had
had
ceased
to
be
afraid
want
to
know
the
worst
i
presently
declared
have
to
open
the
letter
it
also
contains
an
i
felt
was
fat
and
uncanny
within
wheels
i
exclaimed
something
for
me
too
to
they
tell
miss
i
stared
i
felt
a
certain
thrill
they
send
it
to
her
directly
saltram
hung
fire
staying
with
and
why
should
that
prevent
again
my
visitor
faltered
and
i
began
to
reflect
on
the
grotesque
the
unconscious
perversity
of
her
action
i
was
the
only
person
save
george
gravener
and
the
mulvilles
who
was
aware
of
sir
gregory
and
of
miss
strange
bounty
where
could
there
have
been
a
more
signal
illustration
of
the
clumsiness
of
human
affairs
than
her
having
complacently
selected
this
moment
to
fly
in
the
face
of
it
the
chance
of
their
seeing
her
letters
they
know
still
i
understand
then
it
flashed
upon
me
mean
they
might
intercept
it
how
can
you
imply
anything
so
base
i
indignantly
demanded
not
pudney
cried
saltram
with
a
flush
his
own
why
he
send
the
letter
to
you
to
be
delivered
embarrassment
increased
she
gave
me
another
hard
look
must
make
that
out
for
i
made
it
out
quickly
enough
a
denunciation
real
lady
betray
her
husband
this
virtuous
woman
exclaimed
i
burst
out
laughing
and
i
fear
my
laugh
may
have
had
an
effect
of
impertinence
to
miss
anvoy
so
easily
shocked
why
do
such
things
concern
i
asked
much
at
a
loss
there
exposed
to
all
his
craft
and
pudney
have
been
watching
this
they
feel
she
may
be
taken
you
for
all
the
rest
of
us
what
difference
can
it
make
when
she
has
lost
her
power
to
contribute
again
saltram
considered
then
very
nobly
are
other
things
in
the
world
than
this
occurred
to
her
so
long
as
the
young
lady
had
any
but
she
now
added
with
a
glance
at
my
letter
that
and
pudney
doubtless
explained
their
motives
all
in
kindness
she
continued
as
she
got
up
to
miss
anvoy
you
took
on
the
whole
another
view
of
kindness
before
her
my
companion
smiled
with
some
acidity
no
safer
than
the
mulvilles
i
want
her
to
think
that
nor
that
she
should
report
to
the
pudneys
that
they
had
not
been
happy
in
their
agent
and
i
well
remember
that
this
was
the
moment
at
which
i
began
with
considerable
emotion
to
promise
myself
to
enjoin
upon
miss
anvoy
never
to
open
any
letter
that
should
come
to
her
in
one
of
those
penny
envelopes
my
emotion
and
i
fear
i
must
add
my
confusion
quickly
deepened
i
presently
should
have
been
as
glad
to
frighten
saltram
as
to
think
i
might
by
some
diplomacy
restore
the
pudneys
to
a
quieter
vigilance
best
you
should
take
view
of
my
safety
i
at
any
rate
soon
responded
when
i
saw
she
know
what
i
meant
by
this
i
added
may
turn
out
to
have
done
in
bringing
me
this
letter
a
thing
profoundly
my
tone
had
a
significance
which
i
could
see
did
make
her
uneasy
and
there
was
a
moment
after
i
had
made
two
or
three
more
remarks
of
studiously
bewildering
effect
at
which
her
eyes
followed
so
hungrily
the
little
flourish
of
the
letter
with
which
i
emphasised
them
that
i
instinctively
slipped
communication
into
my
pocket
she
looked
in
her
embarrassed
annoyance
capable
of
grabbing
it
to
send
it
back
to
him
i
felt
after
she
had
gone
as
if
i
had
almost
given
her
my
word
i
deliver
the
enclosure
the
passionate
movement
at
any
rate
with
which
in
solitude
i
transferred
the
whole
thing
unopened
from
my
pocket
to
a
drawer
which
i
would
have
amounted
for
an
initiated
observer
to
some
such
pledge
xii
saltram
left
me
drawing
my
breath
more
quickly
and
indeed
almost
in
if
i
had
just
perilously
grazed
the
loss
of
something
precious
i
quite
know
what
it
had
a
shocking
resemblance
to
my
honour
the
emotion
was
the
livelier
surely
in
that
my
pulses
even
yet
vibrated
to
the
pleasure
with
which
the
night
before
i
had
rallied
to
the
rare
analyst
the
great
intellectual
adventurer
and
pathfinder
what
had
dropped
from
me
like
a
cumbersome
garment
as
saltram
appeared
before
me
in
the
afternoon
on
the
heath
was
the
disposition
to
haggle
over
his
value
hang
it
one
had
to
choose
one
had
to
put
that
value
somewhere
so
i
would
put
it
really
high
and
have
done
with
it
mulville
drove
in
for
him
at
a
discreet
earliest
she
could
suppose
him
to
have
got
up
and
i
learned
that
miss
anvoy
would
also
have
come
had
she
not
been
expecting
a
visit
from
gravener
i
was
perfectly
mindful
that
i
was
under
bonds
to
see
this
young
lady
and
also
that
i
had
a
letter
to
hand
to
her
but
i
took
my
time
i
waited
from
day
to
day
i
left
saltram
to
deal
as
her
apprehensions
should
prompt
with
the
pudneys
i
knew
at
last
what
i
had
ceased
to
wince
at
my
responsibility
i
gave
this
supreme
impression
of
saltram
time
to
fade
if
it
would
but
it
fade
and
individually
it
faded
even
now
during
the
month
that
i
thus
invited
myself
to
stiffen
again
adelaide
mulville
perplexed
by
my
absence
wrote
to
me
to
ask
why
i
so
stiff
at
that
season
of
the
year
i
was
usually
oftener
them
she
also
wrote
that
she
feared
a
real
estrangement
had
set
in
between
gravener
and
her
sweet
young
state
of
things
but
half
satisfactory
to
her
so
long
as
the
advantage
resulting
to
saltram
failed
to
disengage
itself
from
the
merely
nebulous
state
she
intimated
that
her
sweet
young
friend
was
if
anything
a
trifle
too
reserved
she
also
intimated
that
there
might
now
be
an
opening
for
another
clever
young
man
there
never
was
the
slightest
opening
i
may
here
parenthesise
and
of
course
the
question
come
up
these
are
old
frustrations
now
ruth
anvoy
married
i
hear
and
neither
have
i
during
the
month
toward
the
end
i
wrote
to
george
gravener
to
ask
if
on
a
special
errand
i
might
come
to
see
him
and
his
answer
was
to
knock
the
very
next
day
at
my
door
i
saw
he
had
immediately
connected
my
enquiry
with
the
talk
we
had
had
in
the
and
his
promptitude
showed
that
the
ashes
of
his
eagerness
yet
cold
i
told
him
there
was
something
i
felt
i
ought
in
candour
to
let
him
recognised
the
obligation
his
friendly
confidence
had
laid
on
me
mean
miss
anvoy
has
talked
to
you
she
has
told
me
so
herself
he
said
to
tell
you
so
that
i
wanted
to
see
you
i
replied
it
seemed
to
me
that
such
a
communication
would
rest
wholly
with
herself
if
however
she
did
speak
to
you
of
our
conversation
she
probably
told
you
i
was
the
subject
of
a
present
application
of
the
coxon
the
case
of
saltram
my
dear
fellow
i
know
what
you
call
discouraging
gravener
cried
i
thought
i
was
and
i
thought
she
thought
i
believe
she
did
but
such
a
measured
by
the
effect
not
he
said
her
own
affair
the
reason
i
asked
you
to
see
me
was
that
it
appeared
to
me
i
ought
to
tell
you
frankly
undertake
to
produce
that
effect
in
fact
i
want
to
very
good
of
you
damn
you
my
visitor
laughed
red
and
really
grave
then
he
said
like
to
see
that
scoundrel
publicly
on
the
pedestal
of
a
great
complimentary
pension
i
braced
myself
one
form
of
public
recognition
with
another
it
seems
to
me
on
the
whole
i
should
be
able
to
bear
it
when
i
see
the
compliments
that
paid
right
and
left
i
ask
myself
why
this
one
take
its
course
this
therefore
is
what
entitled
to
have
looked
to
me
to
mention
to
you
some
evidence
that
perhaps
would
be
really
dissuasive
but
i
propose
to
invite
mss
anvoy
to
remain
in
ignorance
of
to
invite
me
to
do
the
same
you
require
evidence
enough
i
speak
of
a
sealed
letter
that
been
requested
to
deliver
to
you
mean
to
only
one
consideration
that
would
make
me
i
said
clear
handsome
eyes
plunged
into
mine
a
minute
but
evidently
without
fishing
up
a
clue
to
this
failure
by
which
i
was
almost
wounded
does
the
letter
contain
sealed
as
i
tell
you
and
i
know
what
it
is
it
sent
through
you
than
you
i
wondered
how
to
put
the
thing
only
explanation
i
can
think
of
is
that
the
person
sending
it
may
have
imagined
your
relations
with
miss
anvoy
to
be
at
an
have
been
told
this
is
the
case
by
relations
with
miss
anvoy
are
not
at
an
end
poor
gravener
stammered
again
for
an
instant
i
thought
offer
i
propose
to
make
you
gives
me
the
right
to
address
you
a
question
remarkably
direct
are
you
still
engaged
to
miss
anvoy
not
he
slowly
brought
out
perfectly
good
good
friends
that
again
become
prospective
husband
and
wife
if
the
obstacle
in
your
path
be
removed
he
anxiously
repeated
i
send
miss
anvoy
the
letter
i
speak
of
she
may
give
up
her
for
sake
send
it
do
so
if
ready
to
assure
me
that
her
sacrifice
would
now
presumably
bring
about
your
marry
her
the
next
day
my
visitor
cried
but
would
she
marry
what
i
ask
of
you
of
course
is
nothing
less
than
your
word
of
honour
as
to
your
conviction
of
this
if
you
give
it
me
i
said
engage
to
hand
her
the
letter
before
gravener
took
up
his
hat
turning
it
mechanically
round
he
stood
looking
a
moment
hard
at
its
unruffled
perfection
then
very
angrily
honestly
and
gallantly
it
to
the
devil
he
broke
out
with
which
he
clapped
the
hat
on
his
head
and
left
me
you
read
it
or
not
i
said
to
ruth
anvoy
at
wimbledon
when
i
had
told
her
the
story
of
visit
she
debated
for
a
time
probably
of
the
briefest
but
long
enough
to
make
me
nervous
you
brought
it
with
you
indeed
at
home
locked
there
was
another
great
silence
and
then
she
said
back
and
destroy
i
went
back
but
i
destroy
it
till
after
death
when
i
burnt
it
unread
the
pudneys
approached
her
again
pressingly
but
prompt
as
they
were
the
coxon
fund
had
already
become
an
operative
benefit
and
a
general
amaze
saltram
while
we
gathered
about
as
it
were
to
watch
the
manna
descend
had
begun
to
draw
the
magnificent
income
he
drew
it
as
he
had
always
drawn
everything
with
a
grand
abstracted
gesture
its
magnificence
alas
as
all
the
world
now
knows
quite
quenched
him
it
was
the
beginning
of
his
decline
it
was
also
naturally
a
new
grievance
for
his
wife
who
began
to
believe
in
him
as
soon
as
he
was
blighted
and
who
at
this
hour
accuses
us
of
having
bribed
him
on
the
whim
of
a
meddlesome
american
to
renounce
his
glorious
office
to
become
as
she
says
like
everybody
else
the
very
day
he
found
himself
able
to
publish
he
wholly
ceased
to
produce
this
deprived
us
as
may
easily
be
imagined
of
much
of
our
occupation
and
especially
deprived
the
mulvilles
whose
want
of
i
never
measured
till
they
lost
their
great
inmate
no
one
to
live
on
now
most
frequent
reference
to
their
destitution
is
embodied
in
the
remark
that
dear
intentions
were
doubtless
good
she
and
kent
are
even
yet
looking
for
another
prop
but
no
one
presents
a
true
sphere
of
usefulness
they
complain
that
people
are
with
saltram
the
fine
type
of
the
child
of
adoption
was
scattered
the
grander
the
elder
style
got
their
carriage
back
but
an
empty
carriage
in
short
i
think
we
were
all
happier
as
well
as
poorer
before
even
including
george
gravener
who
by
the
deaths
of
his
brother
and
his
nephew
has
lately
become
lord
maddock
his
wife
whose
fortune
clears
the
property
is
criminally
dull
he
hates
being
in
the
upper
house
and
yet
had
high
office
but
what
are
these
accidents
which
i
should
perhaps
apologise
for
mentioning
in
the
light
of
the
great
eventual
boon
promised
the
patient
by
the
rate
at
which
the
coxon
fund
must
be
rolling
up
