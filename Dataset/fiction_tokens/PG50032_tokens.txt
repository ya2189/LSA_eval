nello
and
patrasche
were
left
all
alone
in
the
world
they
were
friends
in
a
friendship
closer
than
brotherhood
nello
was
a
little
was
a
big
fleming
they
were
both
of
the
same
age
by
length
of
years
yet
one
was
still
young
and
the
other
was
already
old
they
had
dwelt
together
almost
all
their
days
both
were
orphaned
and
destitute
and
owed
their
lives
to
the
same
hand
it
had
been
the
beginning
of
the
tie
between
them
their
first
bond
of
sympathy
and
it
had
strengthened
day
by
day
and
had
grown
with
their
growth
firm
and
indissoluble
until
they
loved
one
another
very
greatly
their
home
was
a
little
hut
on
the
edge
of
a
little
flemish
village
a
league
from
antwerp
set
amidst
flat
breadths
of
pasture
and
with
long
lines
of
poplars
and
of
alders
bending
in
the
breeze
on
the
edge
of
the
great
canal
which
ran
through
it
it
had
about
a
score
of
houses
and
homesteads
with
shutters
of
bright
green
or
and
roofs
or
black
and
white
and
walls
until
they
shone
in
the
sun
like
snow
in
the
centre
of
the
village
stood
a
windmill
placed
on
a
little
slope
it
was
a
landmark
to
all
the
level
country
round
it
had
once
been
painted
scarlet
sails
and
all
but
that
had
been
in
its
infancy
half
a
century
or
more
earlier
when
it
had
ground
wheat
for
the
soldiers
of
napoleon
and
it
was
now
a
ruddy
brown
tanned
by
wind
and
weather
it
went
queerly
by
fits
and
starts
as
though
rheumatic
and
stiff
in
the
joints
from
age
but
it
served
the
whole
neighborhood
which
would
have
thought
it
almost
as
impious
to
carry
grain
elsewhere
as
to
attend
any
other
religious
service
than
the
mass
that
was
performed
at
the
altar
of
the
little
old
gray
church
with
its
conical
steeple
which
stood
opposite
to
it
and
whose
single
bell
rang
morning
noon
and
night
with
that
strange
subdued
hollow
sadness
which
every
bell
that
hangs
in
the
low
countries
seems
to
gain
as
an
integral
part
of
its
melody
within
sound
of
the
little
melancholy
clock
almost
from
their
birth
upward
they
had
dwelt
together
nello
and
patrasche
in
the
little
hut
on
the
edge
of
the
village
with
the
cathedral
spire
of
antwerp
rising
in
the
beyond
the
great
green
plain
of
seeding
grass
and
spreading
corn
that
stretched
away
from
them
like
a
tideless
changeless
sea
it
was
the
hut
of
a
very
old
man
of
a
very
poor
old
jehan
daas
who
in
his
time
had
been
a
soldier
and
who
remembered
the
wars
that
had
trampled
the
country
as
oxen
tread
down
the
furrows
and
who
had
brought
from
his
service
nothing
except
a
wound
which
had
made
him
a
cripple
when
old
jehan
daas
had
reached
his
full
eighty
his
daughter
had
died
in
the
ardennes
hard
by
stavelot
and
had
left
him
in
legacy
her
son
the
old
man
could
ill
contrive
to
support
himself
but
he
took
up
the
additional
burden
uncomplainingly
and
it
soon
became
welcome
and
precious
to
him
little
was
but
a
pet
diminutive
for
with
him
and
the
old
man
and
the
little
child
lived
in
the
poor
little
hut
contentedly
it
was
a
very
humble
little
indeed
but
it
was
clean
and
white
as
a
and
stood
in
a
small
plot
of
that
yielded
beans
and
herbs
and
pumpkins
they
were
very
poor
terribly
a
day
they
had
nothing
at
all
to
eat
they
never
by
any
chance
had
enough
to
have
had
enough
to
eat
would
have
been
to
have
reached
paradise
at
once
but
the
old
man
was
very
gentle
and
good
to
the
boy
and
the
boy
was
a
beautiful
innocent
truthful
creature
and
they
were
happy
on
a
crust
and
a
few
leaves
of
cabbage
and
asked
no
more
of
earth
or
heaven
save
indeed
that
patrasche
should
be
always
with
them
since
without
patrasche
where
would
they
have
been
for
patrasche
was
their
alpha
and
omega
their
treasury
and
granary
their
store
of
gold
and
wand
of
wealth
their
and
minister
their
only
friend
and
comforter
patrasche
dead
or
gone
from
them
they
must
have
laid
themselves
down
and
died
likewise
patrasche
was
body
brains
hands
head
and
feet
to
both
of
them
patrasche
was
their
very
life
their
very
soul
for
jehan
daas
was
old
and
a
cripple
and
nello
was
but
a
child
and
patrasche
was
their
dog
a
dog
of
of
hide
large
of
head
and
limb
with
ears
that
stood
erect
and
legs
bowed
and
feet
widened
in
the
muscular
development
wrought
in
his
breed
by
many
generations
of
hard
service
patrasche
came
of
a
race
which
had
toiled
hard
and
cruelly
from
sire
to
son
in
flanders
many
a
of
slaves
dogs
of
the
people
beasts
of
the
shafts
and
the
harness
creatures
that
lived
straining
their
sinews
in
the
gall
of
the
cart
and
died
breaking
their
hearts
on
the
flints
of
the
streets
patrasche
had
been
born
of
parents
who
had
labored
hard
all
their
days
over
the
stones
of
the
various
cities
and
the
long
shadowless
weary
roads
of
the
two
flanders
and
of
brabant
he
had
been
born
to
no
other
heritage
than
those
of
pain
and
of
toil
he
had
been
fed
on
curses
and
baptized
with
blows
why
not
it
was
a
christian
country
and
patrasche
was
but
a
dog
before
he
was
fully
grown
he
had
known
the
bitter
gall
of
the
cart
and
the
collar
before
he
had
entered
his
thirteenth
month
he
had
become
the
property
of
a
who
was
accustomed
to
wander
over
the
land
north
and
south
from
the
blue
sea
to
the
green
mountains
they
sold
him
for
a
small
price
because
he
was
so
young
this
man
was
a
drunkard
and
a
brute
the
life
of
patrasche
was
a
life
of
hell
to
deal
the
tortures
of
hell
on
the
animal
creation
is
a
way
which
the
christians
have
of
showing
their
belief
in
it
his
purchaser
was
a
sullen
brutal
brabantois
who
heaped
his
cart
full
with
pots
and
pans
and
flagons
and
buckets
and
other
wares
of
crockery
and
brass
and
tin
and
left
patrasche
to
draw
the
load
as
best
he
might
whilst
he
himself
lounged
idly
by
the
side
in
fat
and
sluggish
ease
smoking
his
black
pipe
and
stopping
at
every
wineshop
or
café
on
the
road
happily
for
was
very
strong
he
came
of
an
iron
race
long
born
and
bred
to
such
cruel
travail
so
that
he
did
not
die
but
managed
to
drag
on
a
wretched
existence
under
the
brutal
burdens
the
scarifying
lashes
the
hunger
the
thirst
the
blows
the
curses
and
the
exhaustion
which
are
the
only
wages
with
which
the
flemings
repay
the
most
patient
and
laborious
of
all
their
victims
one
day
after
two
years
of
this
long
and
deadly
agony
patrasche
was
going
on
as
usual
along
one
of
the
straight
dusty
unlovely
roads
that
lead
to
the
city
of
rubens
it
was
full
midsummer
and
very
warm
his
cart
was
very
heavy
piled
high
with
goods
in
metal
and
in
earthenware
his
owner
sauntered
on
without
noticing
him
otherwise
than
by
the
crack
of
the
whip
as
it
curled
round
his
quivering
loins
the
brabantois
had
paused
to
drink
beer
himself
at
every
wayside
house
but
he
had
forbidden
patrasche
to
stop
a
moment
for
a
draught
from
the
canal
going
along
thus
in
the
full
sun
on
a
scorching
highway
having
eaten
nothing
for
hours
and
which
was
far
worse
to
him
not
having
tasted
water
for
near
twelve
being
blind
with
dust
sore
with
blows
and
stupefied
with
the
merciless
weight
which
dragged
upon
his
loins
patrasche
for
once
staggered
and
foamed
a
little
at
the
mouth
and
fell
he
fell
in
the
middle
of
the
white
dusty
road
in
the
full
glare
of
the
sun
he
was
sick
unto
death
and
motionless
his
master
gave
him
the
only
medicine
in
his
and
oaths
and
blows
with
a
cudgel
of
oak
which
had
been
often
the
only
food
and
drink
the
only
wage
and
reward
ever
offered
to
him
but
patrasche
was
beyond
the
reach
of
any
torture
or
of
any
curses
patrasche
lay
dead
to
all
appearances
down
in
the
white
powder
of
the
summer
dust
after
a
while
finding
it
useless
to
assail
his
ribs
with
punishment
and
his
ears
with
maledictions
the
life
gone
in
him
or
going
so
nearly
that
his
carcass
was
forever
useless
unless
indeed
some
one
should
strip
it
of
the
skin
for
him
fiercely
in
farewell
struck
off
the
leathern
bands
of
the
harness
kicked
his
body
heavily
aside
into
the
grass
and
groaning
and
muttering
in
savage
wrath
pushed
the
cart
lazily
along
the
road
and
left
the
dying
dog
there
for
the
ants
to
sting
and
for
the
crows
to
pick
it
was
the
last
day
before
kermesse
away
at
louvain
and
the
brabantois
was
in
haste
to
reach
the
fair
and
get
a
good
place
for
his
truck
of
brass
wares
he
was
in
fierce
wrath
because
patrasche
had
been
a
strong
and
animal
and
because
he
himself
had
now
the
hard
task
of
pushing
his
charette
all
the
way
to
louvain
but
to
stay
to
look
after
patrasche
never
entered
his
thoughts
the
beast
was
dying
and
useless
and
he
would
steal
to
replace
him
the
first
large
dog
that
he
found
wandering
alone
out
of
sight
of
its
master
patrasche
had
cost
him
nothing
or
next
to
nothing
and
for
two
long
cruel
years
had
made
him
toil
ceaselessly
in
his
service
from
sunrise
to
sunset
through
summer
and
winter
in
fair
weather
and
foul
he
had
got
a
fair
use
and
a
good
profit
out
of
patrasche
being
human
he
was
wise
and
left
the
dog
to
draw
his
last
breath
alone
in
the
ditch
and
have
his
bloodshot
eyes
plucked
out
as
they
might
be
by
the
birds
whilst
he
himself
went
on
his
way
to
beg
and
to
steal
to
eat
and
to
drink
to
dance
and
to
sing
in
the
mirth
at
louvain
a
dying
dog
a
dog
of
the
should
he
waste
hours
over
its
agonies
at
peril
of
losing
a
handful
of
copper
coins
at
peril
of
a
shout
of
laughter
patrasche
lay
there
flung
in
the
ditch
it
was
a
busy
road
that
day
and
hundreds
of
people
on
foot
and
on
mules
in
wagons
or
in
carts
went
by
tramping
quickly
and
joyously
on
to
louvain
some
saw
him
most
did
not
even
look
all
passed
on
a
dead
dog
more
or
was
nothing
in
brabant
it
would
be
nothing
anywhere
in
the
world
after
a
time
among
the
there
came
a
little
old
man
who
was
bent
and
lame
and
very
feeble
he
was
in
no
guise
for
feasting
he
was
very
poorly
and
miserably
clad
and
he
dragged
his
silent
way
slowly
through
the
dust
among
the
he
looked
at
patrasche
paused
wondered
turned
aside
then
kneeled
down
in
the
rank
grass
and
weeds
of
the
ditch
and
surveyed
the
dog
with
kindly
eyes
of
pity
there
was
with
him
a
little
rosy
child
of
a
few
years
old
who
pattered
in
amidst
the
bushes
that
were
for
him
and
stood
gazing
with
a
pretty
seriousness
upon
the
poor
great
quiet
beast
thus
it
was
that
these
two
first
little
nello
and
the
big
patrasche
the
upshot
of
that
day
was
that
old
jehan
daas
with
much
laborious
effort
drew
the
sufferer
homeward
to
his
own
little
hut
which
was
a
throw
off
amidst
the
fields
and
there
tended
him
with
so
much
care
that
the
sickness
which
had
been
a
brain
seizure
brought
on
by
heat
and
thirst
and
exhaustion
with
time
and
shade
and
rest
passed
away
and
health
and
strength
returned
and
patrasche
staggered
up
again
upon
his
four
stout
tawny
legs
now
for
many
weeks
he
had
been
useless
powerless
sore
near
to
death
but
all
this
time
he
had
heard
no
rough
word
had
felt
no
harsh
touch
but
only
the
pitying
murmurs
of
the
little
voice
and
the
soothing
caress
of
the
old
hand
in
his
sickness
they
too
had
grown
to
care
for
him
this
lonely
old
man
and
the
little
happy
child
he
had
a
corner
of
the
hut
with
a
heap
of
dry
grass
for
his
bed
and
they
had
learned
to
listen
eagerly
for
his
breathing
in
the
dark
night
to
tell
them
that
he
lived
and
when
he
first
was
well
enough
to
essay
a
loud
hollow
broken
bay
they
laughed
aloud
and
almost
wept
together
for
joy
at
such
a
sign
of
his
sure
restoration
and
little
nello
in
delighted
glee
hung
round
his
rugged
neck
with
chains
of
marguerites
and
kissed
him
with
fresh
and
ruddy
lips
so
then
when
patrasche
arose
himself
again
strong
big
gaunt
powerful
his
great
wistful
eyes
had
a
gentle
astonishment
in
them
that
there
were
no
curses
to
rouse
him
and
no
blows
to
drive
him
and
his
heart
awakened
to
a
mighty
love
which
never
wavered
once
in
its
fidelity
whilst
life
abode
with
him
but
patrasche
being
a
dog
was
grateful
patrasche
lay
pondering
long
with
grave
tender
musing
brown
eyes
watching
the
movements
of
his
friends
now
the
old
soldier
jehan
daas
could
do
nothing
for
his
living
but
limp
about
a
little
with
a
small
cart
with
which
he
carried
daily
the
of
those
happier
neighbors
who
owned
cattle
away
into
the
town
of
antwerp
the
villagers
gave
him
the
employment
a
little
out
of
because
it
suited
them
well
to
send
their
milk
into
the
town
by
so
honest
a
carrier
and
bide
at
home
themselves
to
look
after
their
gardens
their
cows
their
poultry
or
their
little
fields
but
it
was
becoming
hard
work
for
the
old
man
he
was
and
antwerp
was
a
good
league
off
or
more
patrasche
watched
the
come
and
go
that
one
day
when
he
had
got
well
and
was
lying
in
the
sun
with
the
wreath
of
marguerites
round
his
tawny
neck
the
next
morning
patrasche
before
the
old
man
had
touched
the
cart
arose
and
walked
to
it
and
placed
himself
betwixt
its
handles
and
testified
as
plainly
as
dumb
show
could
do
his
desire
and
his
ability
to
work
in
return
for
the
bread
of
charity
that
he
had
eaten
jehan
daas
resisted
long
for
the
old
man
was
one
of
those
who
thought
it
a
foul
shame
to
bind
dogs
to
labor
for
which
nature
never
formed
them
but
patrasche
would
not
be
gainsaid
finding
they
did
not
harness
him
he
tried
to
draw
the
cart
onward
with
his
teeth
at
length
jehan
daas
gave
way
vanquished
by
the
persistence
and
the
gratitude
of
this
creature
whom
he
had
succored
he
fashioned
his
cart
so
that
patrasche
could
run
in
it
and
this
he
did
every
morning
of
his
life
thenceforward
when
the
winter
came
jehan
daas
thanked
the
blessed
fortune
that
had
brought
him
to
the
dying
dog
in
the
ditch
that
of
louvain
for
he
was
very
old
and
he
grew
feebler
with
each
year
and
he
would
ill
have
known
how
to
pull
his
load
of
over
the
snows
and
through
the
deep
ruts
in
the
mud
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
strength
and
the
industry
of
the
animal
he
had
befriended
as
for
patrasche
it
seemed
heaven
to
him
after
the
frightful
burdens
that
his
old
master
had
compelled
him
to
strain
under
at
the
call
of
the
whip
at
every
step
it
seemed
nothing
to
him
but
amusement
to
step
out
with
this
little
light
green
cart
with
its
bright
brass
cans
by
the
side
of
the
gentle
old
man
who
always
paid
him
with
a
tender
caress
and
with
a
kindly
word
besides
his
work
was
over
by
three
or
four
in
the
day
and
after
that
time
he
was
free
to
do
as
he
stretch
himself
to
sleep
in
the
sun
to
wander
in
the
fields
to
romp
with
the
young
child
or
to
play
with
his
patrasche
was
very
happy
fortunately
for
his
peace
his
former
owner
was
killed
in
a
drunken
brawl
at
the
kermesse
of
mechlin
and
so
sought
not
after
him
nor
disturbed
him
in
his
new
and
home
a
few
years
later
old
jehan
daas
who
had
always
been
a
cripple
became
so
paralyzed
with
rheumatism
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
go
out
with
the
cart
any
more
then
little
nello
being
now
grown
to
his
sixth
year
of
age
and
knowing
the
town
well
from
having
accompanied
his
grandfather
so
many
times
took
his
place
beside
the
cart
and
sold
the
milk
and
received
the
coins
in
exchange
and
brought
them
back
to
their
respective
owners
with
a
pretty
grace
and
seriousness
which
charmed
all
who
beheld
him
the
little
ardennois
was
a
beautiful
child
with
dark
grave
tender
eyes
and
a
lovely
bloom
upon
his
face
and
fair
locks
that
clustered
to
his
throat
and
many
an
artist
sketched
the
group
as
it
went
by
green
cart
with
the
brass
flagons
of
teniers
and
mieris
and
van
tal
and
the
great
massive
dog
with
his
belled
harness
that
chimed
cheerily
as
he
went
and
the
small
figure
that
ran
beside
him
which
had
little
white
feet
in
great
wooden
shoes
and
a
soft
grave
innocent
happy
face
like
the
little
fair
children
of
rubens
nello
and
patrasche
did
the
work
so
well
and
so
joyfully
together
that
jehan
daas
himself
when
the
summer
came
and
he
was
better
again
had
no
need
to
stir
out
but
could
sit
in
the
doorway
in
the
sun
and
see
them
go
forth
through
the
garden
wicket
and
then
doze
and
dream
and
pray
a
little
and
then
awake
again
as
the
clock
tolled
three
and
watch
for
their
return
and
on
their
return
patrasche
would
shake
himself
free
of
his
harness
with
a
bay
of
glee
and
nello
would
recount
with
pride
the
doings
of
the
day
and
they
would
all
go
in
together
to
their
meal
of
rye
bread
and
milk
or
soup
and
would
see
the
shadows
lengthen
over
the
great
plain
and
see
the
twilight
veil
the
fair
cathedral
spire
and
then
lie
down
together
to
sleep
peacefully
while
the
old
man
said
a
prayer
so
the
days
and
the
years
went
on
and
the
lives
of
nello
and
patrasche
were
happy
innocent
and
healthful
in
the
spring
and
summer
especially
were
they
glad
flanders
is
not
a
lovely
land
and
around
the
burgh
of
rubens
it
is
perhaps
least
lovely
of
all
corn
and
colza
pasture
and
plough
succeed
each
other
on
the
characterless
plain
in
wearying
repetition
and
save
by
some
gaunt
gray
tower
with
its
peal
of
pathetic
bells
or
some
figure
coming
athwart
the
fields
made
picturesque
by
a
bundle
or
a
fagot
there
is
no
change
no
variety
no
beauty
anywhere
and
he
who
has
dwelt
upon
the
mountains
or
amidst
the
forests
feels
oppressed
as
by
imprisonment
with
the
tedium
and
the
endlessness
of
that
vast
and
dreary
level
but
it
is
green
and
very
fertile
and
it
has
wide
horizons
that
have
a
certain
charm
of
their
own
even
in
their
dulness
and
monotony
and
among
the
rushes
by
the
the
flowers
grow
and
the
trees
rise
tall
and
fresh
where
the
barges
glide
with
their
great
hulks
black
against
the
sun
and
their
little
green
barrels
and
flags
gay
against
the
leaves
anyway
there
is
greenery
and
breadth
of
space
enough
to
be
as
good
as
beauty
to
a
child
and
a
dog
and
these
two
asked
no
better
when
their
work
was
done
than
to
lie
buried
in
the
lush
grasses
on
the
side
of
the
canal
and
watch
the
cumbrous
vessels
drifting
by
and
bringing
the
crisp
salt
smell
of
the
sea
among
the
blossoming
scents
of
the
country
summer
true
in
the
winter
it
was
harder
and
they
had
to
rise
in
the
darkness
and
the
bitter
cold
and
they
had
seldom
as
much
as
they
could
have
eaten
any
day
and
the
hut
was
scarce
better
than
a
shed
when
the
nights
were
cold
although
it
looked
so
pretty
in
warm
weather
buried
in
a
great
vine
that
never
bore
fruit
indeed
but
which
covered
it
with
luxuriant
green
tracery
all
through
the
months
of
blossom
and
harvest
in
winter
the
winds
found
many
holes
in
the
walls
of
the
poor
little
hut
and
the
vine
was
black
and
leafless
and
the
bare
lands
looked
very
bleak
and
drear
without
and
sometimes
within
the
floor
was
flooded
and
then
frozen
in
winter
it
was
hard
and
the
snow
numbed
the
little
white
limbs
of
nello
and
the
icicles
cut
the
brave
untiring
feet
of
patrasche
but
even
then
they
were
never
heard
to
lament
either
of
them
the
wooden
shoes
and
the
four
legs
would
trot
manfully
together
over
the
frozen
fields
to
the
chime
of
the
bells
on
the
harness
and
then
sometimes
in
the
streets
of
antwerp
some
housewife
would
bring
them
a
bowl
of
soup
and
a
handful
of
bread
or
some
kindly
trader
would
throw
some
billets
of
fuel
into
the
little
cart
as
it
went
homeward
or
some
woman
in
their
own
village
would
bid
them
keep
some
share
of
the
milk
they
carried
for
their
own
food
and
then
they
would
run
over
the
white
lands
through
the
early
darkness
bright
and
happy
and
burst
with
a
shout
of
joy
into
their
home
so
on
the
whole
it
was
well
with
them
very
well
and
patrasche
meeting
on
the
highway
or
in
the
public
streets
the
many
dogs
who
toiled
from
daybreak
into
nightfall
paid
only
with
blows
and
curses
and
loosened
from
the
shafts
with
a
kick
to
starve
and
freeze
as
best
they
in
his
heart
was
very
grateful
to
his
fate
and
thought
it
the
fairest
and
the
kindliest
the
world
could
hold
though
he
was
often
very
hungry
indeed
when
he
lay
down
at
night
though
he
had
to
work
in
the
heats
of
summer
noons
and
the
rasping
chills
of
winter
dawns
though
his
feet
were
often
tender
with
wounds
from
the
sharp
edges
of
the
jagged
pavement
though
he
had
to
perform
tasks
beyond
his
strength
and
against
his
he
was
grateful
and
content
he
did
his
duty
with
each
day
and
the
eyes
that
he
loved
smiled
down
on
him
it
was
sufficient
for
patrasche
there
was
only
one
thing
which
caused
patrasche
any
uneasiness
in
his
life
and
it
was
this
antwerp
as
all
the
world
knows
is
full
at
every
turn
of
old
piles
of
stones
dark
and
ancient
and
majestic
standing
in
crooked
courts
jammed
against
gateways
and
taverns
rising
by
the
edge
with
bells
ringing
above
them
in
the
air
and
ever
and
again
out
of
their
arched
doors
a
swell
of
music
pealing
there
they
remain
the
grand
old
sanctuaries
of
the
past
shut
in
amidst
the
squalor
the
hurry
the
crowds
the
unloveliness
and
the
commerce
of
the
modern
world
and
all
day
long
the
clouds
drift
and
the
birds
circle
and
the
winds
sigh
around
them
and
beneath
the
earth
at
their
feet
there
and
the
greatness
of
the
mighty
master
still
rests
upon
antwerp
and
wherever
we
turn
in
its
narrow
streets
his
glory
lies
therein
so
that
all
mean
things
are
thereby
transfigured
and
as
we
pace
slowly
through
the
winding
ways
and
by
the
edge
of
the
stagnant
water
and
through
the
noisome
courts
his
spirit
abides
with
us
and
the
heroic
beauty
of
his
visions
is
about
us
and
the
stones
that
once
felt
his
footsteps
and
bore
his
shadow
seem
to
arise
and
speak
of
him
with
living
voices
for
the
city
which
is
the
tomb
of
rubens
still
lives
to
us
through
him
and
him
alone
it
is
so
quiet
there
by
that
great
white
quiet
save
only
when
the
organ
peals
and
the
choir
cries
aloud
the
salve
regina
or
the
kyrie
eleison
sure
no
artist
ever
had
a
greater
gravestone
than
that
pure
marble
sanctuary
gives
to
him
in
the
heart
of
his
birthplace
in
the
chancel
of
jacques
without
rubens
what
were
antwerp
a
dirty
dusky
bustling
mart
which
no
man
would
ever
care
to
look
upon
save
the
traders
who
do
business
on
its
wharves
with
rubens
to
the
whole
world
of
men
it
is
a
sacred
name
a
sacred
soil
a
bethlehem
where
a
god
of
art
saw
light
a
golgotha
where
a
god
of
art
lies
dead
o
nations
closely
should
you
treasure
your
great
men
for
by
them
alone
will
the
future
know
of
you
flanders
in
her
generations
has
been
wise
in
his
life
she
glorified
this
greatest
of
her
sons
and
in
his
death
she
magnifies
his
name
but
her
wisdom
is
very
rare
now
the
trouble
of
patrasche
was
this
into
these
great
sad
piles
of
stones
that
reared
their
melancholy
majesty
above
the
crowded
roofs
the
child
nello
would
many
and
many
a
time
enter
and
disappear
through
their
dark
arched
portals
whilst
patrasche
left
without
upon
the
pavement
would
wearily
and
vainly
ponder
on
what
could
be
the
charm
which
thus
allured
from
him
his
inseparable
and
beloved
companion
once
or
twice
he
did
essay
to
see
for
himself
clattering
up
the
steps
with
his
behind
him
but
thereon
he
had
been
always
sent
back
again
summarily
by
a
tall
custodian
in
black
clothes
and
silver
chains
of
office
and
fearful
of
bringing
his
little
master
into
trouble
he
desisted
and
remained
couched
patiently
before
the
churches
until
such
time
as
the
boy
reappeared
it
was
not
the
fact
of
his
going
into
them
which
disturbed
patrasche
he
knew
that
people
went
to
church
all
the
village
went
to
the
small
tumbledown
gray
pile
opposite
the
red
windmill
what
troubled
him
was
that
little
nello
always
looked
strangely
when
he
came
out
always
very
flushed
or
very
pale
and
whenever
he
returned
home
after
such
visitations
would
sit
silent
and
dreaming
not
caring
to
play
but
gazing
out
at
the
evening
skies
beyond
the
line
of
the
canal
very
subdued
and
almost
sad
what
was
it
wondered
patrasche
he
thought
it
could
not
be
good
or
natural
for
the
little
lad
to
be
so
grave
and
in
his
dumb
fashion
he
tried
all
he
could
to
keep
nello
by
him
in
the
sunny
fields
or
in
the
busy
but
to
the
churches
nello
would
go
most
often
of
all
would
he
go
to
the
great
cathedral
and
patrasche
left
without
on
the
stones
by
the
iron
fragments
of
quentin
gate
would
stretch
himself
and
yawn
and
sigh
and
even
howl
now
and
then
all
in
vain
until
the
doors
closed
and
the
child
perforce
came
forth
again
and
winding
his
arms
about
the
neck
would
kiss
him
on
his
broad
forehead
and
murmur
always
the
same
words
i
could
only
see
them
patrasche
i
could
only
see
them
what
were
they
pondered
patrasche
looking
up
with
large
wistful
sympathetic
eyes
one
day
when
the
custodian
was
out
of
the
way
and
the
doors
left
ajar
he
got
in
for
a
moment
after
his
little
friend
and
saw
were
two
great
covered
pictures
on
either
side
of
the
choir
nello
was
kneeling
rapt
as
in
an
ecstasy
before
the
of
the
assumption
and
when
he
noticed
patrasche
and
rose
and
drew
the
dog
gently
out
into
the
air
his
face
was
wet
with
tears
and
he
looked
up
at
the
veiled
places
as
he
passed
them
and
murmured
to
his
companion
is
so
terrible
not
to
see
them
patrasche
just
because
one
is
poor
and
can
not
pay
he
never
meant
that
the
poor
should
not
see
them
when
he
painted
them
i
am
sure
he
would
have
had
us
see
them
any
day
every
day
that
i
am
sure
and
they
keep
them
shrouded
in
the
dark
the
beautiful
things
they
never
feel
the
light
and
no
eyes
look
on
them
unless
rich
people
come
and
pay
if
i
could
only
see
them
i
would
be
content
to
but
he
could
not
see
them
and
patrasche
could
not
help
him
for
to
gain
the
silver
piece
that
the
church
exacts
as
the
price
for
looking
on
the
glories
of
the
elevation
of
the
cross
and
the
descent
of
the
cross
was
a
thing
as
utterly
beyond
the
powers
of
either
of
them
as
it
would
have
been
to
scale
the
heights
of
the
cathedral
spire
they
had
never
so
much
as
a
sou
to
spare
if
they
cleared
enough
to
get
a
little
wood
for
the
stove
a
little
broth
for
the
pot
it
was
the
utmost
they
could
do
and
yet
the
heart
of
the
child
was
set
in
sore
and
endless
longing
upon
beholding
the
greatness
of
the
two
veiled
rubens
the
whole
soul
of
the
little
ardennois
thrilled
and
stirred
with
an
absorbing
passion
for
art
going
on
his
ways
through
the
old
city
in
the
early
days
before
the
sun
or
the
people
had
risen
nello
who
looked
only
a
little
with
a
great
dog
drawing
milk
to
sell
from
door
to
door
was
in
a
heaven
of
dreams
whereof
rubens
was
the
god
nello
cold
and
hungry
with
stockingless
feet
in
wooden
shoes
and
the
winter
winds
blowing
among
his
curls
and
lifting
his
poor
thin
garments
was
in
a
rapture
of
meditation
wherein
all
that
he
saw
was
the
beautiful
fair
face
of
the
mary
of
the
assumption
with
the
waves
of
her
golden
hair
lying
upon
her
shoulders
and
the
light
of
an
eternal
sun
shining
down
upon
her
brow
nello
reared
in
poverty
and
buffeted
by
fortune
and
untaught
in
letters
and
unheeded
by
men
had
the
compensation
of
the
curse
which
is
called
genius
no

knew
it

as
little
as
any
no
one
knew
it
only
indeed
patrasche
who
being
with
him
always
saw
him
draw
with
chalk
upon
the
stones
any
and
every
thing
that
grew
or
breathed
heard
him
on
his
little
bed
of
hay
murmur
all
manner
of
timid
pathetic
prayers
to
the
spirit
of
the
great
master
watched
his
gaze
darken
and
his
face
radiate
at
the
evening
glow
of
sunset
or
the
rosy
rising
of
the
dawn
and
felt
many
and
many
a
time
the
tears
of
a
strange
nameless
pain
and
joy
mingled
together
fall
hotly
from
the
bright
young
eyes
upon
his
own
wrinkled
yellow
forehead
should
go
to
my
grave
quite
content
if
i
thought
nello
that
when
thou
growest
a
man
thou
couldst
own
this
hut
and
the
little
plot
of
ground
and
labor
for
thyself
and
be
called
baas
by
thy
neighbors
said
the
old
man
jehan
many
an
hour
from
his
bed
for
to
own
a
bit
of
soil
and
to
be
called
the
hamlet
round
is
to
have
achieved
the
highest
ideal
of
a
flemish
peasant
and
the
old
soldier
who
had
wandered
over
all
the
earth
in
his
youth
and
had
brought
nothing
back
deemed
in
his
old
age
that
to
live
and
die
on
one
spot
in
contented
humility
was
the
fairest
fate
he
could
desire
for
his
darling
but
nello
said
nothing
the
same
leaven
was
working
in
him
that
in
other
times
begat
rubens
and
jordaens
and
the
van
eycks
and
all
their
wondrous
tribe
and
in
times
more
recent
begat
in
the
green
country
of
the
ardennes
where
the
meuse
washes
the
old
walls
of
dijon
the
great
artist
of
the
patroclus
whose
genius
is
too
near
us
for
us
aright
to
measure
its
divinity
nello
dreamed
of
other
things
in
the
future
than
of
tilling
the
little
rood
of
earth
and
living
under
the
wattle
roof
and
being
called
baas
by
neighbors
a
little
poorer
or
a
little
less
poor
than
himself
the
cathedral
spire
where
it
rose
beyond
the
fields
in
the
ruddy
evening
skies
or
in
the
dim
gray
misty
mornings
said
other
things
to
him
than
this
but
these
he
told
only
to
patrasche
whispering
childlike
his
fancies
in
the
ear
when
they
went
together
at
their
work
through
the
fogs
of
the
daybreak
or
lay
together
at
their
rest
among
the
rustling
rushes
by
the
side
for
such
dreams
are
not
easily
shaped
into
speech
to
awake
the
slow
sympathies
of
human
auditors
and
they
would
only
have
sorely
perplexed
and
troubled
the
poor
old
man
bedridden
in
his
corner
who
for
his
part
whenever
he
had
trodden
the
streets
of
antwerp
had
thought
the
daub
of
blue
and
red
that
they
called
a
madonna
on
the
walls
of
the
where
he
drank
his
worth
of
black
beer
quite
as
good
as
any
of
the
famous
for
which
the
stranger
folk
travelled
far
and
wide
into
flanders
from
every
land
on
which
the
good
sun
shone
there
was
only
one
other
beside
patrasche
to
whom
nello
could
talk
at
all
of
his
daring
fantasies
this
other
was
little
alois
who
lived
at
the
old
red
mill
on
the
grassy
mound
and
whose
father
the
miller
was
the
husbandman
in
all
the
village
little
alois
was
only
a
pretty
baby
with
soft
round
rosy
features
made
lovely
by
those
sweet
dark
eyes
that
the
spanish
rule
has
left
in
so
many
a
flemish
face
in
testimony
of
the
alvan
dominion
as
spanish
art
has
left
broadsown
throughout
the
country
majestic
palaces
and
stately
courts
gilded
and
sculptured
in
blazonry
and
poems
in
stone
illustration
nello
drew
their
likeness
with
a
stick
of
charcoal
little
alois
was
often
with
nello
and
patrasche
they
played
in
the
fields
they
ran
in
the
snow
they
gathered
the
daisies
and
bilberries
they
went
up
to
the
old
gray
church
together
and
they
often
sat
together
by
the
broad
in
the
little
alois
indeed
was
the
richest
child
in
the
hamlet
she
had
neither
brother
nor
sister
her
blue
serge
dress
had
never
a
hole
in
it
at
kermesse
she
had
as
many
gilded
nuts
and
agni
dei
in
sugar
as
her
hands
could
hold
and
when
she
went
up
for
her
first
communion
her
flaxen
curls
were
covered
with
a
cap
of
richest
mechlin
lace
which
had
been
her
and
her
before
it
came
to
her
men
spoke
already
though
she
had
but
twelve
years
of
the
good
wife
she
would
be
for
their
sons
to
woo
and
win
but
she
herself
was
a
little
gay
simple
child
in
nowise
conscious
of
her
heritage
and
she
loved
no
playfellows
so
well
as
jehan
grandson
and
his
dog
one
day
her
father
baas
cogez
a
good
man
but
somewhat
stern
came
on
a
pretty
group
in
the
long
meadow
behind
the
mill
where
the
aftermath
had
that
day
been
cut
it
was
his
little
daughter
sitting
amidst
the
hay
with
the
great
tawny
head
of
patrasche
on
her
lap
and
many
wreaths
of
poppies
and
blue
cornflowers
round
them
both
on
a
clean
smooth
slab
of
pine
wood
the
boy
nello
drew
their
likeness
with
a
stick
of
charcoal
the
miller
stood
and
looked
at
the
portrait
with
tears
in
his
eyes
it
was
so
strangely
like
and
he
loved
his
only
child
closely
and
well
then
he
roughly
chid
the
little
girl
for
idling
there
whilst
her
mother
needed
her
within
and
sent
her
indoors
crying
and
afraid
then
turning
he
snatched
the
wood
from
hands
do
much
of
such
folly
he
asked
but
there
was
a
tremble
in
his
voice
nello
colored
and
hung
his
head
draw
everything
i
see
he
murmured
the
miller
was
silent
then
he
stretched
his
hand
out
with
a
franc
in
it
is
folly
as
i
say
and
evil
waste
of
time
nevertheless
it
is
like
alois
and
will
please
the
take
this
silver
bit
for
it
and
leave
it
for
the
color
died
out
of
the
face
of
the
young
ardennois
he
lifted
his
head
and
put
his
hands
behind
his
back
your
money
and
the
portrait
both
baas
cogez
he
said
simply
have
been
often
good
to
then
he
called
patrasche
to
him
and
walked
away
across
the
field
could
have
seen
them
with
that
franc
he
murmured
to
patrasche
i
could
not
sell
her
even
for
bass
cogez
went
into
his
sore
troubled
in
his
mind
lad
must
not
be
so
much
with
alois
he
said
to
his
wife
that
night
may
come
of
it
hereafter
he
is
fifteen
now
and
she
is
twelve
and
the
boy
is
comely
of
face
and
he
is
a
good
lad
and
a
loyal
said
the
housewife
feasting
her
eyes
on
the
piece
of
pine
wood
where
it
was
throned
above
the
chimney
with
a
cuckoo
clock
in
oak
and
a
calvary
in
wax
i
do
not
gainsay
that
said
the
miller
draining
his
pewter
flagon
if
what
you
think
of
were
ever
to
come
to
pass
said
the
wife
hesitatingly
it
matter
so
much
she
will
have
enough
for
both
and
one
can
not
be
better
than
are
a
woman
and
therefore
a
fool
said
the
miller
harshly
striking
his
pipe
on
the
table
lad
is
naught
but
a
beggar
and
with
these
fancies
worse
than
a
beggar
have
a
care
that
they
are
not
together
in
the
future
or
i
will
send
the
child
to
the
surer
keeping
of
the
nuns
of
the
sacred
the
poor
mother
was
terrified
and
promised
humbly
to
do
his
will
not
that
she
could
bring
herself
altogether
to
separate
the
child
from
her
favorite
playmate
nor
did
the
miller
even
desire
that
extreme
of
cruelty
to
a
young
lad
who
was
guilty
of
nothing
except
poverty
but
there
were
many
ways
in
which
little
alois
was
kept
away
from
her
chosen
companion
and
nello
being
a
boy
proud
and
quiet
and
sensitive
was
quickly
wounded
and
ceased
to
turn
his
own
steps
and
those
of
patrasche
as
he
had
been
used
to
do
with
every
moment
of
leisure
to
the
old
red
mill
upon
the
slope
what
his
offence
was
he
did
not
know
he
supposed
he
had
in
some
manner
angered
baas
cogez
by
taking
the
portrait
of
alois
in
the
meadow
and
when
the
child
who
loved
him
would
run
to
him
and
nestle
her
hand
in
his
he
would
smile
at
her
very
sadly
and
say
with
a
tender
concern
for
her
before
himself
alois
do
not
anger
your
father
he
thinks
that
i
make
you
idle
dear
and
he
is
not
pleased
that
you
should
be
with
me
he
is
a
good
man
and
loves
you
well
we
will
not
anger
him
but
it
was
with
a
sad
heart
that
he
said
it
and
the
earth
did
not
look
so
bright
to
him
as
it
had
used
to
do
when
he
went
out
at
sunrise
under
the
poplars
down
the
straight
roads
with
patrasche
the
old
red
mill
had
been
a
landmark
to
him
and
he
had
been
used
to
pause
by
it
going
and
coming
for
a
cheery
greeting
with
its
people
as
her
little
flaxen
head
rose
above
the
low
and
her
little
rosy
hands
had
held
out
a
bone
or
a
crust
to
patrasche
now
the
dog
looked
wistfully
at
a
closed
door
and
the
boy
went
on
without
pausing
with
a
pang
at
his
heart
and
the
child
sat
within
with
tears
dropping
slowly
on
the
knitting
to
which
she
was
set
on
her
little
stool
by
the
stove
and
baas
cogez
working
among
his
sacks
and
his
would
harden
his
will
and
say
to
himself
is
best
so
the
lad
is
all
but
a
beggar
and
full
of
idle
dreaming
fooleries
who
knows
what
mischief
might
not
come
of
it
in
the
future
so
he
was
wise
in
his
generation
and
would
not
have
the
door
unbarred
except
upon
rare
and
formal
occasions
which
seemed
to
have
neither
warmth
nor
mirth
in
them
to
the
two
children
who
had
been
accustomed
so
long
to
a
daily
gleeful
careless
happy
interchange
of
greeting
speech
and
pastime
with
no
other
watcher
of
their
sports
or
auditor
of
their
fancies
than
patrasche
sagely
shaking
the
brazen
bells
of
his
collar
and
responding
with
all
a
swift
sympathies
to
their
every
change
of
mood
all
this
while
the
little
panel
of
pine
wood
remained
over
the
chimney
in
the
with
the
cuckoo
clock
and
the
waxen
calvary
and
sometimes
it
seemed
to
nello
a
little
hard
that
whilst
his
gift
was
accepted
he
himself
should
be
denied
but
he
did
not
complain
it
was
his
habit
to
be
quiet
old
jehan
daas
had
said
ever
to
him
are
poor
we
must
take
what
god
ill
with
the
good
the
poor
can
not
to
which
the
boy
had
always
listened
in
silence
being
reverent
of
his
old
grandfather
but
nevertheless
a
certain
vague
sweet
hope
such
as
beguiles
the
children
of
genius
had
whispered
in
his
heart
the
poor
do
choose
to
be
great
so
that
men
can
not
say
them
and
he
thought
so
still
in
his
innocence
and
one
day
when
the
little
alois
finding
him
by
chance
alone
among
the
cornfields
by
the
canal
ran
to
him
and
held
him
close
and
sobbed
piteously
because
the
morrow
would
be
her
day
and
for
the
first
time
in
all
her
life
her
parents
had
failed
to
bid
him
to
the
little
supper
and
romp
in
the
great
barns
with
which
her
was
always
celebrated
nello
had
kissed
her
and
murmured
to
her
in
firm
faith
shall
be
different
one
day
alois
one
day
that
little
bit
of
pine
wood
that
your
father
has
of
mine
shall
be
worth
its
weight
in
silver
and
he
will
not
shut
the
door
against
me
then
only
love
me
always
dear
little
alois
only
love
me
always
and
i
will
be
if
i
do
not
love
you
the
pretty
child
asked
pouting
a
little
through
her
tears
and
moved
by
the
instinctive
coquetries
of
her
sex
eyes
left
her
face
and
wandered
to
the
distance
where
in
the
red
and
gold
of
the
flemish
night
the
cathedral
spire
rose
there
was
a
smile
on
his
face
so
sweet
and
yet
so
sad
that
little
alois
was
awed
by
it
will
be
great
still
he
said
under
his
still
or
die
do
not
love
me
said
the
little
spoilt
child
pushing
him
away
but
the
boy
shook
his
head
and
smiled
and
went
on
his
way
through
the
tall
yellow
corn
seeing
as
in
a
vision
some
day
in
a
fair
future
when
he
should
come
into
that
old
familiar
land
and
ask
alois
of
her
people
and
be
not
refused
or
denied
but
received
in
honor
whilst
the
village
folk
should
throng
to
look
upon
him
and
say
in
one
ears
see
him
he
is
a
king
among
men
for
he
is
a
great
artist
and
the
world
speaks
his
name
and
yet
he
was
only
our
poor
little
nello
who
was
a
beggar
as
one
may
say
and
only
got
his
bread
by
the
help
of
his
and
he
thought
how
he
would
fold
his
grandsire
in
furs
and
purples
and
portray
him
as
the
old
man
is
portrayed
in
the
family
in
the
chapel
of
jacques
and
of
how
he
would
hang
the
throat
of
patrasche
with
a
collar
of
gold
and
place
him
on
his
right
hand
and
say
to
the
people
was
once
my
only
friend
and
of
how
he
would
build
himself
a
great
white
marble
palace
and
make
to
himself
luxuriant
gardens
of
pleasure
on
the
slope
looking
outward
to
where
the
cathedral
spire
rose
and
not
dwell
in
it
himself
but
summon
to
it
as
to
a
home
all
men
young
and
poor
and
friendless
but
of
the
will
to
do
mighty
things
and
of
how
he
would
say
to
them
always
if
they
sought
to
bless
his
name
do
not
thank
rubens
without
him
what
should
i
have
been
and
these
dreams
beautiful
impossible
innocent
free
of
all
selfishness
full
of
heroical
worship
were
so
closely
about
him
as
he
went
that
he
was
even
on
this
sad
anniversary
of
day
when
he
and
patrasche
went
home
by
themselves
to
the
little
dark
hut
and
the
meal
of
black
bread
whilst
in
the
all
the
children
of
the
village
sang
and
laughed
and
ate
the
big
round
cakes
of
dijon
and
the
almond
gingerbread
of
brabant
and
danced
in
the
great
barn
to
the
light
of
the
stars
and
the
music
of
flute
and
fiddle
mind
patrasche
he
said
with
his
arms
round
the
neck
as
they
both
sat
in
the
door
of
the
hut
where
the
sounds
of
the
mirth
at
the
mill
came
down
to
them
on
the
night
mind
it
shall
all
be
changed
by
and
he
believed
in
the
future
patrasche
of
more
experience
and
of
more
philosophy
thought
that
the
loss
of
the
mill
supper
in
the
present
was
ill
compensated
by
dreams
of
milk
and
honey
in
some
vague
hereafter
and
patrasche
growled
whenever
he
passed
by
baas
cogez
is
is
it
not
said
the
old
man
daas
that
night
from
the
corner
where
he
was
stretched
upon
his
bed
of
sacking
the
boy
gave
a
gesture
of
assent
he
wished
that
the
old
memory
had
erred
a
little
instead
of
keeping
such
sure
account
why
not
there
his
grandfather
pursued
hast
never
missed
a
year
before
art
too
sick
to
leave
murmured
the
lad
bending
his
handsome
young
head
over
the
bed
tut
mother
nulette
would
have
come
and
sat
with
me
as
she
does
scores
of
times
what
is
the
cause
nello
the
old
man
persisted
surely
hast
not
had
ill
words
with
the
little
one
said
the
boy
quickly
with
a
hot
color
in
his
bent
face
and
truly
baas
cogez
did
not
have
me
asked
this
year
he
has
taken
some
whim
against
thou
hast
done
nothing
wrong
i
i
took
the
portrait
of
alois
on
a
piece
of
pine
that
is
the
old
man
was
silent
the
truth
suggested
itself
to
him
with
the
innocent
answer
he
was
tied
to
a
bed
of
dried
leaves
in
the
corner
of
a
wattle
hut
but
he
had
not
wholly
forgotten
what
the
ways
of
the
world
were
like
he
drew
fair
head
fondly
to
his
breast
with
a
tenderer
gesture
art
very
poor
my
child
he
said
with
a
quiver
the
more
in
his
aged
trembling
poor
it
is
very
hard
for
i
am
rich
murmured
nello
and
in
his
innocence
he
thought
with
the
imperishable
powers
that
are
mightier
than
the
might
of
kings
and
he
went
and
stood
by
the
door
of
the
hut
in
the
quiet
autumn
night
and
watched
the
stars
troop
by
and
the
tall
poplars
bend
and
shiver
in
the
wind
all
the
casements
of
the
were
lighted
and
every
now
and
then
the
notes
of
the
flute
came
to
him
the
tears
fell
down
his
cheeks
for
he
was
but
a
child
yet
he
smiled
for
he
said
to
himself
the
future
he
stayed
there
until
all
was
quite
still
and
dark
then
he
and
patrasche
went
within
and
slept
together
long
and
deeply
side
by
side
now
he
had
a
secret
which
only
patrasche
knew
there
was
a
little
to
the
hut
which
no
one
entered
but
dreary
place
but
with
abundant
clear
light
from
the
north
here
he
had
fashioned
himself
rudely
an
easel
in
rough
lumber
and
here
on
a
great
gray
sea
of
stretched
paper
he
had
given
shape
to
one
of
the
innumerable
fancies
which
possessed
his
brain
no
one
had
ever
taught
him
anything
colors
he
had
no
means
to
buy
he
had
gone
without
bread
many
a
time
to
procure
even
the
few
rude
vehicles
that
he
had
here
and
it
was
only
in
black
or
white
that
he
could
fashion
the
things
he
saw
this
great
figure
which
he
had
drawn
here
in
chalk
was
only
an
old
man
sitting
on
a
fallen
that
he
had
seen
old
michel
the
woodman
sitting
so
at
evening
many
a
time
he
had
never
had
a
soul
to
tell
him
of
outline
or
perspective
of
anatomy
or
of
shadow
and
yet
he
had
given
all
the
weary
age
all
the
sad
quiet
patience
all
the
rugged
careworn
pathos
of
his
original
and
given
them
so
that
the
old
lonely
figure
was
a
poem
sitting
there
meditative
and
alone
on
the
dead
tree
with
the
darkness
of
the
descending
night
behind
him
it
was
rude
of
course
in
a
way
and
had
many
faults
no
doubt
and
yet
it
was
real
true
in
nature
true
in
art
and
very
mournful
and
in
a
manner
beautiful
patrasche
had
lain
quiet
countless
hours
watching
its
gradual
creation
after
the
labor
of
each
day
was
done
and
he
knew
that
nello
had
a
and
wild
perhaps
but
strongly
sending
this
great
drawing
to
compete
for
a
prize
of
two
hundred
francs
a
year
which
it
was
announced
in
antwerp
would
be
open
to
every
lad
of
talent
scholar
or
peasant
under
eighteen
who
would
attempt
to
win
it
with
some
unaided
work
of
chalk
or
pencil
three
of
the
foremost
artists
in
the
town
of
rubens
were
to
be
the
judges
and
elect
the
victor
according
to
his
merits
all
the
spring
and
summer
and
autumn
nello
had
been
at
work
upon
this
treasure
which
if
triumphant
would
build
him
his
first
step
toward
independence
and
the
mysteries
of
the
art
which
he
blindly
ignorantly
and
yet
passionately
adored
he
said
nothing
to
any
one
his
grandfather
would
not
have
understood
and
little
alois
was
lost
to
him
only
to
patrasche
he
told
all
and
whispered
would
give
it
me
i
think
if
he
patrasche
thought
so
too
for
he
knew
that
rubens
had
loved
dogs
or
he
had
never
painted
them
with
such
exquisite
fidelity
and
men
who
loved
dogs
were
as
patrasche
knew
always
pitiful
the
drawings
were
to
go
in
on
the
first
day
of
december
and
the
decision
be
given
on
the
so
that
he
who
should
win
might
rejoice
with
all
his
people
at
the
christmas
season
in
the
twilight
of
a
bitter
wintry
day
and
with
a
beating
heart
now
quick
with
hope
now
faint
with
fear
nello
placed
the
great
picture
on
his
little
green
and
took
it
with
the
help
of
patrasche
into
the
town
and
there
left
it
as
enjoined
at
the
doors
of
a
public
building
it
is
worth
nothing
at
all
how
can
i
tell
he
thought
with
the
of
a
great
timidity
now
that
he
had
left
it
there
it
seemed
to
him
so
hazardous
so
vain
so
foolish
to
dream
that
he
a
little
lad
with
bare
feet
who
barely
knew
his
letters
could
do
anything
at
which
great
painters
real
artists
could
ever
deign
to
look
yet
he
took
heart
as
he
went
by
the
cathedral
the
lordly
form
of
rubens
seemed
to
rise
from
the
fog
and
the
darkness
and
to
loom
in
its
magnificence
before
him
whilst
the
lips
with
their
kindly
smile
seemed
to
him
to
murmur
have
courage
it
was
not
by
a
weak
heart
and
by
faint
fears
that
i
wrote
my
name
for
all
time
upon
nello
ran
home
through
the
cold
night
comforted
he
had
done
his
best
the
rest
must
be
as
god
willed
he
thought
in
that
innocent
unquestioning
faith
which
had
been
taught
him
in
the
little
gray
chapel
among
the
willows
and
the
the
winter
was
very
sharp
already
that
night
after
they
reached
the
hut
snow
fell
and
fell
for
very
many
days
after
that
so
that
the
paths
and
the
divisions
in
the
fields
were
all
obliterated
and
all
the
smaller
streams
were
frozen
over
and
the
cold
was
intense
upon
the
plains
then
indeed
it
became
hard
work
to
go
round
for
the
milk
while
the
world
was
all
dark
and
carry
it
through
the
darkness
to
the
silent
town
hard
work
especially
for
patrasche
for
the
passage
of
the
years
that
were
only
bringing
nello
a
stronger
youth
were
bringing
him
old
age
and
his
joints
were
stiff
and
his
bones
ached
often
but
he
would
never
give
up
his
share
of
the
labor
nello
would
fain
have
spared
him
and
drawn
the
cart
himself
but
patrasche
would
not
allow
it
all
he
would
ever
permit
or
accept
was
the
help
of
a
thrust
from
behind
to
the
truck
as
it
lumbered
along
through
the
patrasche
had
lived
in
harness
and
he
was
proud
of
it
he
suffered
a
great
deal
sometimes
from
frost
and
the
terrible
roads
and
the
rheumatic
pains
of
his
limbs
but
he
only
drew
his
breath
hard
and
bent
his
stout
neck
and
trod
onward
with
steady
patience
thee
at
home
is
time
thou
didst
i
can
quite
well
push
in
the
cart
by
myself
urged
nello
many
a
morning
but
patrasche
who
understood
him
aright
would
no
more
have
consented
to
stay
at
home
than
a
veteran
soldier
to
shirk
when
the
charge
was
sounding
and
every
day
he
would
rise
and
place
himself
in
his
shafts
and
plod
along
over
the
snow
through
the
fields
that
his
four
round
feet
had
left
their
print
upon
so
many
many
years
must
never
rest
till
one
dies
thought
patrasche
and
sometimes
it
seemed
to
him
that
that
time
of
rest
for
him
was
not
very
far
off
his
sight
was
less
clear
than
it
had
been
and
it
gave
him
pain
to
rise
after
the
sleep
though
he
would
never
lie
a
moment
in
his
straw
when
once
the
bell
of
the
chapel
tolling
five
let
him
know
that
the
daybreak
of
labor
had
begun
poor
patrasche
we
shall
soon
lie
quiet
together
you
and
i
said
old
jehan
daas
stretching
out
to
stroke
the
head
of
patrasche
with
the
old
withered
hand
which
had
always
shared
with
him
its
one
poor
crust
of
bread
and
the
hearts
of
the
old
man
and
the
old
dog
ached
together
with
one
thought
when
they
were
gone
who
would
care
for
their
darling
one
afternoon
as
they
came
back
from
antwerp
over
the
snow
which
had
become
hard
and
smooth
as
marble
over
all
the
flemish
plains
they
found
dropped
in
the
road
a
pretty
little
puppet
a
all
scarlet
and
gold
about
six
inches
high
and
unlike
greater
personages
when
fortune
lets
them
drop
quite
unspoiled
and
unhurt
by
its
fall
it
was
a
pretty
toy
nello
tried
to
find
its
owner
and
failing
thought
that
it
was
just
the
thing
to
please
alois
it
was
quite
night
when
he
passed
the
he
knew
the
little
window
of
her
room
it
could
be
no
harm
he
thought
if
he
gave
her
his
little
piece
of
they
had
been
playfellows
so
long
there
was
a
shed
with
a
sloping
roof
beneath
her
casement
he
climbed
it
and
tapped
softly
at
the
lattice
there
was
a
little
light
within
the
child
opened
it
and
looked
out
half
frightened
nello
put
the
into
her
hands

a
doll
i
found
in
the
snow
alois
take
it
he
it
and
god
bless
thee
dear
he
slid
down
from
the
before
she
had
time
to
thank
him
and
ran
off
through
the
darkness
that
night
there
was
a
fire
at
the
mill
and
much
corn
were
destroyed
although
the
mill
itself
and
the
were
unharmed
all
the
village
was
out
in
terror
and
engines
came
tearing
through
the
snow
from
antwerp
the
miller
was
insured
and
would
lose
nothing
nevertheless
he
was
in
furious
wrath
and
declared
aloud
that
the
fire
was
due
to
no
accident
but
to
some
foul
intent
nello
awakened
from
his
sleep

to
help
with
the
rest
baas
cogez
thrust
him
angrily
aside
wert
loitering
here
after
dark
he
said
roughly
believe
on
my
soul
that
thou
dost
know
more
of
the
fire
than
any
nello
heard
him
in
silence
stupefied
not
supposing
that
any
one
could
say
such
things
except
in
jest
and
not
comprehending
how
any
one
could
pass
a
jest
at
such
a
time
nevertheless
the
miller
said
the
brutal
thing
openly
to
many
of
his
neighbors
in
the
day
that
followed
and
though
no
serious
charge
was
ever
preferred
against
the
lad
it
got
bruited
about
that
nello
had
been
seen
in
the
after
dark
on
some
unspoken
errand
and
that
he
bore
baas
cogez
a
grudge
for
forbidding
his
intercourse
with
little
alois
and
so
the
hamlet
which
followed
the
sayings
of
its
richest
landowner
servilely
and
whose
families
all
hoped
to
secure
the
riches
of
alois
in
some
future
time
for
their
sons
took
the
hint
to
give
grave
looks
and
cold
words
to
old
jehan
grandson
no
one
said
anything
to
him
openly
but
all
the
village
agreed
together
to
humor
the
prejudice
and
at
the
cottages
and
farms
where
nello
and
patrasche
called
every
morning
for
the
milk
for
antwerp
downcast
glances
and
brief
phrases
replaced
to
them
the
broad
smiles
and
cheerful
greetings
to
which
they
had
been
always
used
no
one
really
credited
the
absurd
suspicion
nor
the
outrageous
accusations
born
of
them
but
the
people
were
all
very
poor
and
very
ignorant
and
the
one
rich
man
of
the
place
had
pronounced
against
him
nello
in
his
innocence
and
his
friendlessness
had
no
strength
to
stem
the
popular
tide
art
very
cruel
to
the
lad
the
wife
dared
to
say
weeping
to
her
lord
he
is
an
innocent
lad
and
a
faithful
and
would
never
dream
of
any
such
wickedness
however
sore
his
heart
might
but
baas
cogez
being
an
obstinate
man
having
once
said
a
thing
held
to
it
doggedly
though
in
his
innermost
soul
he
knew
well
the
injustice
that
he
was
committing
meanwhile
nello
endured
the
injury
done
against
him
with
a
certain
proud
patience
that
disdained
to
complain
he
only
gave
way
a
little
when
he
was
quite
alone
with
old
patrasche
besides
he
thought
it
should
win
they
will
be
sorry
then
still
to
a
boy
not
quite
sixteen
and
who
had
dwelt
in
one
little
world
all
his
short
life
and
in
his
childhood
had
been
caressed
and
applauded
on
all
sides
it
was
a
hard
trial
to
have
the
whole
of
that
little
world
turn
against
him
for
naught
especially
hard
in
that
bleak
when
the
only
light
and
warmth
there
could
be
found

beside
the
village

and
in
the
kindly
greetings
of
neighbors
in
the
all

nearer
to
each
other
all
to
all
except
to
nello
and
patrasche
with
whom
none
now
would
have
anything
to
do
and
who
were
left
to
fare
as
they
might
with
the
old
paralyzed
bedridden
man
in
the
little
cabin
whose
fire
was
often
low
and
whose
board
was
often
without
bread
for
there
was
a
buyer
from
antwerp
who
had
taken
to
drive
his
mule
in
of
a
day
for
the
milk
of
the
various
dairies
and
there
were
only
three
or
four
of
the
people
who
had
refused
his
terms
of
purchase
and
remained
faithful
to
the
little
green
cart
so
that
the
burden
which
patrasche
drew
had
become
very
light
and
the
in
pouch
had
become
alas
very
small
likewise
the
dog
would
stop
as
usual
at
all
the
familiar
gates
which
were
now
closed
to
him
and
look
up
at
them
with
wistful
mute
appeal
and
it
cost
the
neighbors
a
pang
to
shut
their
doors
and
their
hearts
and
let
patrasche
draw
his
cart
on
again
empty
nevertheless
they
did
it
for
they
desired
to
please
baas

very
wild
and

six
feet
deep
and
the
ice

firm
enough
to
bear
oxen
and
men
upon

everywhere
at
this

the
little
village
was
always
gay

and
took
away
from
life
forever
old
jehan
daas
who
had
never
known
of
life
aught
save
its
poverty
and
its
pains
he
had
long
been
half
dead
incapable
of
any
movement
except
a
feeble
gesture
and
powerless
for
anything
beyond
a
gentle
word
and
yet
his
loss
fell
on
them
both
with
a
great
horror
in
it
they
mourned
him
passionately
he
had
passed
away
from
them
in
his
sleep
and
when
in
the
gray
dawn
they
learned
their
bereavement
unutterable
solitude
and
desolation
seemed
to
close
around
them
he
had
long
been
only
a
poor
feeble
paralyzed
old
man
who
could
not
raise
a
hand
in
their
defence
but
he
had
loved
them
well
his
smile
had
always
welcomed
their
return
they
mourned
for
him
unceasingly
refusing
to
be
comforted
as
in
the
white
winter
day
they
followed
the

that
held
his
body
to
the
nameless
grave
by
the
little
gray
church
they
were
his
only
mourners
these
two
whom
he
had
left
friendless
upon
young
boy
and
the
old
dog
he
will
relent
now
and
let
the
poor
lad
come
hither

glancing
at
her
husband
where
he
smoked
by
the
hearth
baas

but
he
hardened
his
heart
and
would
not
unbar
his
door
as
the
little
humble
funeral
went
by
boy

a
beggar
he
said
to
himself

the
woman

not

anything
aloud
but
when
the
grave
was
closed
and
the
mourners
had
gone
she
put
a
wreath
of
immortelles
into
hands
and
bade
her
go
and
lay
it
reverently
on
the
dark
unmarked
mound
where
the
snow
was
displaced
nello
and
patrasche
went
home
with
broken
hearts
but
even
of
that
poor
melancholy
cheerless
home
they
were
denied
the
consolation
there
was
a
rent
for
their
little
home
and
when
nello
had
paid
the
last
sad
service
to
the
dead
he
had
not
a
coin
left
he
went
and
begged
grace
of
the
owner
of
the
hut
a
cobbler
who
went
every
sunday
night
to
drink
his
pint
of
wine
and
smoke
with
baas
cogez
the
cobbler
would
grant
no
mercy
he
was
a
harsh
miserly
man
and
loved
money
he
claimed
in
default
of
his
rent
every
stick
and
stone
every
pot
and
pan
in
the
hut
and
bade
nello
and
patrasche
be
out
of
it
on
the
morrow
now
the
cabin
was
lowly
enough
and
in
some
sense
miserable
enough
and
yet
their
hearts
clove
to
it
with
a
great
affection
they
had
been
so
happy
there
and
in
the
summer
with
its
clambering
vine
and
its
flowering
beans
it
was
so
pretty
and
bright
in
the
midst
of
the
fields
there
life
in
it
had
been
full
of
labor
and
privation
and
yet
they
had
been
so
well
content
so
gay
of
heart
running
together
to
meet
the
old
smile
of
welcome
all
night
long
the
boy
and
the
dog
sat
by
the
fireless
hearth
in
the
darkness
drawn
close
together
for
warmth
and
sorrow
their
bodies
were
insensible
to
the
cold
but
their
hearts
seemed
frozen
in
them
when
the
morning
broke
over
the
white
chill
earth
it
was
the
morning
of
christmas
eve
with
a
shudder
nello
clasped
close
to
him
his
only
friend
while
his
tears
fell
hot
and
fast
on
the
frank
forehead
us
go
dear
patrasche
he
murmured
will
not
wait
to
be
kicked
out
let
us
patrasche
had
no
will
but
his
and
they
went
sadly
side
by
side
out
from
the
little
place
which
was
so
dear
to
them
both
and
in
which
every
humble
homely
thing
was
to
them
precious
and
beloved
patrasche
drooped
his
head
wearily
as
he
passed
by
his
own
green
cart
it
was
no
longer
had
to
go
with
the
rest
to
pay
the
rent
and
his
brass
harness
lay
idle
and
glittering
on
the
snow
the
dog
could
have
lain
down
beside
it
and
died
for
very
as
he
went
but
whilst
the
lad
lived
and
needed
him
patrasche
would
not
yield
and
give
way
they
took
the
old
accustomed
road
into
antwerp
the
day
had
yet
scarce
more
than
dawned
most
of
the
shutters
were
still
closed
but
some
of
the
villagers
were
about
they
took
no
notice
whilst
the
dog
and
the
boy
passed
by
them
at
one
door
nello
paused
and
looked
wistfully
within
his
grandfather
had
done
many
a
kindly
turn
in
service
to
the
people
who
dwelt
there
you
give
patrasche
a
crust
he
said
timidly
is
old
and
he
has
had
nothing
since
last
the
woman
shut
the
door
hastily
murmuring
some
vague
saying
about
wheat
and
rye
being
very
dear
that
season
the
boy
and
the
dog
went
on
again
wearily
they
asked
no
more
by
slow
and
painful
ways
they
reached
antwerp
as
the
chimes
toiled
ten
i
had
anything
about
me
i
could
sell
to
get
him
bread
thought
nello
but
he
had
nothing
except
the
wisp
of
linen
and
serge
that
covered
him
and
his
pair
of
wooden
shoes
patrasche
understood
and
nestled
his
nose
into
the
hand
as
though
to
pray
him
not
to
be
disquieted
for
any
woe
or
want
of
his
the
winner
of
the
was
to
be
proclaimed
at
noon
and
to
the
public
building
where
he
had
left
his
treasure
nello
made
his
way
on
the
steps
and
in
the
there
was
a
crowd
of
of
his
age
some
older
all
with
parents
or
relatives
or
friends
his
heart
was
sick
with
fear
as
he
went
among
them
holding
patrasche
close
to
him
the
great
bells
of
the
city
clashed
out
the
hour
of
noon
with
brazen
clamor
the
doors
of
the
inner
hall
were
opened
the
eager
panting
throng
rushed
in
it
was
known
that
the
selected
picture
would
be
raised
above
the
rest
upon
a
wooden
dais
a
mist
obscured
sight
his
head
swam
his
limbs
almost
failed
him
when
his
vision
cleared
he
saw
the
drawing
raised
on
high
it
was
not
his
own
a
slow
sonorous
voice
was
proclaiming
aloud
that
victory
had
been
adjudged
to
stephan
kiesslinger
born
in
the
burgh
of
antwerp
son
of
a
wharfinger
in
that
town
when
nello
recovered
his
consciousness
he
was
lying
on
the
stones
without
and
patrasche
was
trying
with
every
art
he
knew
to
call
him
back
to
life
in
the
distance
a
throng
of
the
youths
of
antwerp
were
shouting
around
their
successful
comrade
and
escorting
him
with
acclamations
to
his
home
upon
the
quay
the
boy
staggered
to
his
feet
and
drew
the
dog
into
his
embrace
is
all
over
dear
patrasche
he
over
he
rallied
himself
as
best
he
could
for
he
was
weak
from
fasting
and
retraced
his
steps
to
the
village
patrasche
paced
by
his
side
with
his
head
drooping
and
his
old
limbs
feeble
from
hunger
and
sorrow
the
snow
was
falling
fast
a
keen
hurricane
blew
from
the
north
it
was
bitter
as
death
on
the
plains
it
took
them
long
to
traverse
the
familiar
path
and
the
bells
were
sounding
four
of
the
clock
as
they
approached
the
hamlet
suddenly
patrasche
paused
arrested
by
a
scent
in
the
snow
scratched
whined
and
drew
out
with
his
teeth
a
small
case
of
brown
leather
he
held
it
up
to
nello
in
the
darkness
where
they
were
there
stood
a
little
calvary
and
a
lamp
burned
dully
under
the
cross
the
boy
mechanically
turned
the
case
to
the
light
on
it
was
the
name
of
baas
cogez
and
within
it
were
notes
for
two
thousand
francs
the
sight
roused
the
lad
a
little
from
his
stupor
he
thrust
it
in
his
shirt
and
stroked
patrasche
and
drew
him
onward
the
dog
looked
up
wistfully
in
his
face
nello
made
straight
for
the
and
went
to
the
and
struck
on
its
panels
the
wife
opened
it
weeping
with
little
alois
clinging
close
to
her
skirts
it
thee
thou
poor
lad
she
said
kindly
through
her
tears
thee
gone
ere
the
baas
see
thee
we
are
in
sore
trouble
he
is
out
seeking
for
a
power
of
money
that
he
has
let
fall
riding
homeward
and
in
this
snow
he
never
will
find
it
and
god
knows
it
will
go
nigh
to
ruin
us
it
is
own
judgment
for
the
things
we
have
done
to
nello
put
the
in
her
hand
and
called
patrasche
within
the
house
found
the
money
he
said
quickly
baas
cogez
so
i
think
he
will
not
deny
the
dog
shelter
and
food
in
his
old
age
keep
him
from
pursuing
me
and
i
pray
of
you
to
be
good
to
ere
either
woman
or
dog
knew
what
he
meant
he
had
stooped
and
kissed
patrasche
then
closed
the
door
hurriedly
and
disappeared
in
the
gloom
of
the
night
the
woman
and
the
child
stood
speechless
with
joy
and
fear
patrasche
vainly
spent
the
fury
of
his
anguish
against
the
oak
of
the
barred
they
did
not
dare
unbar
the
door
and
let
him
forth
they
tried
all
they
could
to
solace
him
they
brought
him
sweet
cakes
and
juicy
meats
they
tempted
him
with
the
best
they
had
they
tried
to
lure
him
to
abide
by
the
warmth
of
the
hearth
but
it
was
of
no
avail
patrasche
refused
to
be
comforted
or
to
stir
from
the
barred
portal
it
was
six
when
from
an
opposite
entrance
the
miller
at
last
came
jaded
and
broken
into
his
presence
is
lost
forever
he
said
with
an
ashen
cheek
and
a
quiver
in
his
stern
voice
have
looked
with
lanterns
everywhere
it
is
little
portion
and
all
his
wife
put
the
money
into
his
hand
and
told
him
how
it
had
come
to
her
the
strong
man
sank
trembling
into
a
seat
and
covered
his
face
ashamed
and
almost
afraid
have
been
cruel
to
the
lad
he
muttered
at
length
deserved
not
to
have
good
at
his
little
alois
taking
courage
crept
close
to
her
father
and
nestled
against
him
her
fair
curly
head
may
come
here
again
father
she
whispered
may
come
as
he
used
to
do
the
miller
pressed
her
in
his
arms
his
hard
sunburned
face
was
very
pale
and
his
mouth
trembled
surely
he
answered
his
child
shall
bide
here
on
christmas
day
and
any
other
day
he
will
god
helping
me
i
will
make
amends
to
the
will
make
little
alois
kissed
him
in
gratitude
and
joy
then
slid
from
his
knees
and
ran
to
where
the
dog
kept
watch
by
the
door
i
may
feast
patrasche
she
cried
in
a
thoughtless
glee
her
father
bent
his
head
gravely
ay
let
the
dog
have
the
best
for
the
stern
old
man

moved
and
shaken
to
his
depths
it
was
christmas
eve
and
the
was
filled
with
oak
logs
and
squares
of
turf
with
cream
and
honey
with
meat
and
bread
and
the
rafters
were
hung
with
wreaths
of
evergreen
and
the
calvary
and
the
cuckoo
clock
looked
out
from
a
mass
of
holly
there
were
little
paper
lanterns
too
for
alois
and
toys
of
various
fashions
and
sweetmeats
in
papers
there
were
light
and
warmth
and
abundance
everywhere
and
the
child
would
fain
have
made
the
dog
a
guest
honored
and
feasted
but
patrasche
would
neither
lie
in
the
warmth
nor
share
in
the
cheer
famished
he
was
and
very
cold
but
without
nello
he
would
partake
neither
of
comfort
nor
food
against
all
temptation
he
was
proof
and
close
against
the
door
he
leaned
always
watching
only
for
a
means
of
escape
wants
the
lad
said
baas
cogez
dog
good
dog
i
will
go
over
to
the
lad
the
first
thing
at
for
no
one
but
patrasche
knew
that
nello
had
left
the
hut
and
no
one
but
patrasche
divined
that
nello
had
gone
to
face
starvation
and
misery
alone
the
was
very
warm
great
logs
crackled
and
flamed
on
the
hearth
neighbors
came
in
for
a
glass
of
wine
and
a
slice
of
the
fat
goose
baking
for
supper

and
sure
of

playmate

on

morrow

and

and
tossed
back
her
yellow
hair

in
the
fulness
of
his
heart
smiled
on
her
through
moistened
eyes
and
spoke
of
the
way
in
which
he
would
befriend
her
favorite
companion
the
sat
with
calm
contented
face
at
the
the
cuckoo
in
the
clock
chirped
mirthful
hours
amidst
it
all
patrasche
was
bidden
with
a
thousand
words
of
welcome
to
tarry
there
a
cherished
guest
but
neither
peace
nor
plenty
could
allure
him
where
nello
was
not
when
the
supper
smoked
on
the
board
and
the
voices
were
loudest
and
gladdest
and
the
brought
choicest
gifts
to
alois
patrasche
watching
always
an
occasion
glided
out
when
the
door
was
unlatched
by
a
careless
and
as
swiftly
as
his
weak
and
tired
limbs
would
bear
him
sped
over
the
snow
in
the
bitter
black
night
he
had
only
one
follow
nello
a
human
friend
might
have
paused
for
the
pleasant
meal
the
cheery
warmth
the
cosey
slumber
but
that
was
not
the
friendship
of
patrasche
he
remembered
a
bygone
time
when
an
old
man
and
a
little
child
had
found
him
sick
unto
death
in
the
wayside
ditch
snow
had
fallen
freshly
all
the
evening
long
it
was
now
nearly
ten
the
trail
of
the
footsteps
was
almost
obliterated
it
took
patrasche
long
to
discover
any
scent
when
at
last
he
found
it
it
was
lost
again
quickly
and
lost
and
recovered
and
again
lost
and
again
recovered
a
hundred
times
or
more
the
night
was
very
wild
the
lamps
under
the
wayside
crosses
were
blown
out
the
roads
were
sheets
of
ice
the
impenetrable
darkness
hid
every
trace
of
habitations
there
was
no
living
thing
abroad
all
the
cattle
were
housed
and
in
all
the
huts
and
homesteads
men
and
women
rejoiced
and
feasted
there
was
only
patrasche
out
in
the
cruel
and
famished
and
full
of
pain
but
with
the
strength
and
the
patience
of
a
great
love
to
sustain
him
in
his
search
the
trail
of
steps
faint
and
obscure
as
it
was
under
the
new
snow
went
straightly
along
the
accustomed
tracks
into
antwerp
it
was
past
midnight
when
patrasche
traced
it
over
the
boundaries
of
the
town
and
into
the
narrow
tortuous
gloomy
streets
it
was
all
quite
dark
in
the
town
save
where
some
light
gleamed
ruddily
through
the
crevices
of
or
some
group
went
homeward
with
lanterns
chanting
the
streets
were
all
white
with
ice
the
high
walls
and
roofs
loomed
black
against
them
there
was
scarce
a
sound
save
the
riot
of
the
winds
down
the
passages
as
they
tossed
the
creaking
signs
and
shook
the
tall
so
many
had
trodden
through
and
through
the
snow
so
many
diverse
paths
had
crossed
and
each
other
that
the
dog
had
a
hard
task
to
retain
any
hold
on
the
track
he
followed
but
he
kept
on
his
way
though
the
cold
pierced
him
to
the
bone
and
the
jagged
ice
cut
his
feet
and
the
hunger
in
his
body
gnawed
like
a
teeth
he
kept
on
his
way
a
poor
gaunt
shivering
thing
and
by
long
patience
traced
the
steps
he
loved
into
the
very
heart
of
the
burgh
and
up
to
the
steps
of
the
great
cathedral
is
gone
to
the
things
that
he
loved
thought
patrasche
he
could
not
understand
but
he
was
full
of
sorrow
and
of
pity
for
the
that
to
him
was
so
incomprehensible
and
yet
so
sacred
the
portals
of
the
cathedral
were
unclosed
after
the
midnight
mass
some
heedlessness
in
the
custodians
too
eager
to
go
home
and
feast
or
sleep
or
too
drowsy
to
know
whether
they
turned
the
keys
aright
had
left
one
of
the
doors
unlocked
by
that
accident
the
patrasche
sought
had
passed
through
into
the
building
leaving
the
white
marks
of
snow
upon
the
dark
stone
floor
by
that
slender
white
thread
frozen
as
it
fell
he
was
guided
through
the
intense
silence
through
the
immensity
of
the
vaulted
straight
to
the
gates
of
the
chancel
and
stretched
there
upon
the
stones
he
found
nello
he
crept
up
and
touched
the
face
of
the
boy
thou
dream
that
i
should
be
faithless
and
forsake
thee
dog
said
that
mute
caress
the
lad
raised
himself
with
a
low
cry
and
clasped
him
close
us
lie
down
and
die
together
he
murmured
have
no
need
of
us
and
we
are
all
in
answer
patrasche
crept
closer
yet
and
laid
his
head
upon
the
young
breast
the
great
tears
stood
in
his
brown
sad
eyes
not
for
himself
he
was
happy
they
lay
close
together
in
the
piercing
cold
the
blasts
that
blew
over
the
flemish
dikes
from
the
northern
seas
were
like
waves
of
ice
which
froze
every
living
thing
they
touched
the
interior
of
the
immense
vault
of
stone
in
which
they
were
was
even
more
bitterly
chill
than
the
plains
without
now
and
then
a
bat
moved
in
the
and
then
a
gleam
of
light
came
on
the
ranks
of
carven
figures
under
the
rubens
they
lay
together
quite
still
and
soothed
almost
into
a
dreaming
slumber
by
the
numbing
narcotic
of
the
cold
together
they
dreamed
of
the
old
glad
days
when
they
had
chased
each
other
through
the
flowering
grasses
of
the
summer
meadows
or
sat
hidden
in
the
tall
bulrushes
by
the
side
watching
the
boats
go
seaward
in
the
sun
suddenly
through
the
darkness
a
great
white
radiance
streamed
through
the
vastness
of
the
aisles
the
moon
that
was
at
her
height
had
broken
through
the
clouds
the
snow
had
ceased
to
fall
the
light
reflected
from
the
snow
without
was
clear
as
the
light
of
dawn
it
fell
through
the
arches
full
upon
the
two
pictures
above
from
which
the
boy
on
his
entrance
had
flung
back
the
veil
the
elevation
and
the
descent
of
the
cross
were
for
one
instant
visible
nello
rose
to
his
feet
and
stretched
his
arms
to
them
the
tears
of
a
passionate
ecstasy
glistened
on
the
paleness
of
his
face
have
seen
them
at
last
he
cried
aloud
god
it
is
enough
his
limbs
failed
under
him
and
he
sank
upon
his
knees
still
gazing
upward
at
the
majesty
that
he
adored
for
a
few
brief
moments
the
light
illumined
the
divine
visions
that
had
been
denied
to
him
so
clear
and
sweet
and
strong
as
though
it
streamed
from
the
throne
of
heaven
then
suddenly
it
passed
away
once
more
a
great
darkness
covered
the
face
of
christ
the
arms
of
the
boy
drew
close
again
the
body
of
the
dog
shall
see
his
he
murmured
he
will
not
part
us
i
on
the
morrow
by
the
chancel
of
the
cathedral
the
people
of
antwerp
found
them
both
they
were
both
dead
the
cold
of
the
night
had
frozen
into
stillness
alike
the
young
life
and
the
old
when
the
christmas
morning
broke
and
the
priests
came
to
the
temple
they
saw
them
lying
thus
on
the
stones
together
above
the
veils
were
drawn
back
from
the
great
visions
of
rubens
and
the
fresh
rays
of
the
sunrise
touched
the
head
of
the
christ
as
the
day
grew
on
there
came
an
old
man
who
wept
as
women
weep
was
cruel
to
the
lad
he
muttered
now
i
would
have
made
to
the
half
of
my
he
should
have
been
to
me
as
a
there
came
also
as
the
day
grew
apace
a
painter
who
had
fame
in
the
world
and
who
was
liberal
of
hand
and
of
spirit
seek
one
who
should
have
had
the
prize
yesterday
had
worth
won
he
said
to
the
boy
of
rare
promise
and
genius
an
old
on
a
fallen
tree
at
was
all
his
theme
but
there
was
greatness
for
the
future
in
it
i
would
fain
find
him
and
take
him
with
me
and
teach
him
and
a
little
child
with
curling
fair
hair
sobbing
bitterly
as
she
clung
to
her
arm
cried
aloud
nello
come
we
have
all
ready
for
thee
the
hands
are
full
of
gifts
and
the
old
piper
will
play
for
us
and
the
mother
says
thou
shalt
stay
by
the
hearth
and
burn
nuts
with
us
all
the
noël
week
even
to
the
feast
of
the
kings
and
patrasche
will
be
so
happy
oh
nello
wake
and
come
but
the
young
pale
face
turned
upward
to
the
light
of
the
great
rubens
with
a
smile
upon
its
mouth
answered
them
all
is
too
for
the
sweet
sonorous
bells
went
ringing
through
the
frost
and
the
sunlight
shone
upon
the
plains
of
snow
and
the
populace
trooped
gay
and
glad
through
the
streets
but
nello
and
patrasche
no
more
asked
charity
at
their
hands
all
they
needed
now
antwerp
gave
unbidden
death
had
been
more
pitiful
to
them
than
longer
life
would
have
been
it
had
taken
the
one
in
the
loyalty
of
love
and
the
other
in
the
innocence
of
faith
from
a
world
which
for
love
has
no
recompense
and
for
faith
no
fulfilment
all
their
lives
they
had
been
together
and
in
their
deaths
they
were
not
divided
for
when
they
were
found
the
arms
of
the
boy
were
folded
too
closely
around
the
dog
to
be
severed
without
violence
and
the
people
of
their
little
village
contrite
and
ashamed
implored
a
special
grace
for
them
and
making
them
one
grave
laid
them
to
rest
there
side
by
the
nürnberg
stove
august
lived
in
a
little
town
called
hall
hall
is
a
favorite
name
for
several
towns
in
austria
and
in
germany
but
this
one
especial
little
hall
in
the
upper
innthal
is
one
of
the
most
charming
places
that
i
know
and
august
for
his
part
did
not
know
any
other
it
has
the
green
meadows
and
the
great
mountains
all
about
it
and
the
water
rushes
by
it
it
has
paved
streets
and
enchanting
little
shops
that
have
all
latticed
panes
and
iron
gratings
to
them
it
has
a
very
grand
old
gothic
church
that
has
the
noblest
blendings
of
light
and
shadow
and
marble
tombs
of
dead
knights
and
a
look
of
infinite
strength
and
repose
as
a
church
should
have
then
there
is
the
muntze
tower
black
and
white
rising
out
of
greenery
and
looking
down
on
a
long
wooden
bridge
and
the
broad
rapid
river
and
there
is
an
old
schloss
which
has
been
made
into
a
with
battlements
and
frescos
and
heraldic
devices
in
gold
and
colors
and
a
carved
in
stone
standing
in
his
niche
and
bearing
his
date
a
little
farther
on
but
close
at
hand
is
a
cloister
with
beautiful
marble
columns
and
tombs
and
a
colossal
calvary
and
beside
that
a
small
and
very
rich
chapel
indeed
so
full
is
the
little
town
of
the
undisturbed
past
that
to
walk
in
it
is
like
opening
a
missal
of
the
middle
ages
all
emblazoned
and
illuminated
with
saints
and
warriors
and
it
is
so
clean
and
so
still
and
so
noble
by
reason
of
its
monuments
and
its
historic
color
that
i
marvel
much
no
one
has
ever
cared
to
sing
its
praises
the
old
pious
heroic
life
of
an
age
at
once
more
restful
and
more
brave
than
ours
still
leaves
its
spirit
there
and
then
there
is
the
girdle
of
the
mountains
all
around
and
that
alone
means
strength
peace
majesty
in
this
little
town
a
few
years
ago
august
strehla
lived
with
his
people
in
the
irregular
square
where
the
grand
church
stands
he
was
a
small
boy
of
nine
years
at
that
time
little
man
with
rosy
cheeks
big
hazel
eyes
and
clusters
of
curls
the
brown
of
ripe
nuts
his
mother
was
dead
his
father
was
poor
and
there
were
many
mouths
at
home
to
feed
in
this
country
the
winters
are
long
and
very
cold
the
whole
land
lies
wrapped
in
snow
for
many
months
and
this
night
that
he
was
trotting
home
with
a
jug
of
beer
in
his
numb
red
hands
was
terribly
cold
and
dreary
the
good
burghers
of
hall
had
shut
their
double
shutters
and
the
few
lamps
there
were
flickered
dully
behind
their
quaint
iron
casings
the
mountains
indeed
were
beautiful
all
under
the
stars
that
are
so
big
in
frost
hardly
any
one
was
astir
a
few
good
souls
wending
home
from
vespers
a
tired
who
blew
a
shrill
blast
from
his
tasselled
horn
as
he
pulled
up
his
sledge
before
a
hostelry
and
little
august
hugging
his
jug
of
beer
to
his
ragged
sheepskin
coat
were
all
who
were
abroad
for
the
snow
fell
heavily
and
the
good
folks
of
hall
go
early
to
their
beds
he
could
not
run
or
he
would
have
spilled
the
beer
he
was
half
frozen
and
a
little
frightened
but
he
kept
up
his
courage
by
saying
over
and
over
again
to
himself
shall
soon
be
at
home
with
dear
he
went
on
through
the
streets
past
the
stone
of
the
and
so
into
the
place
where
the
great
church
was
and
where
near
it
stood
his
father
karl
house
with
a
sculptured
bethlehem
over
the
and
the
pilgrimage
of
the
three
kings
painted
on
its
wall
he
had
been
sent
on
a
long
errand
outside
the
gates
in
the
afternoon
over
the
frozen
fields
and
the
broad
white
snow
and
had
been
belated
and
had
thought
he
had
heard
the
wolves
behind
him
at
every
step
and
had
reached
the
town
in
a
great
state
of
terror
thankful
with
all
his
little
panting
heart
to
see
the
burning
under
the
first
but
he
had
not
forgotten
to
call
for
the
beer
and
he
carried
it
carefully
now
though
his
hands
were
so
numb
that
he
was
afraid
they
would
let
the
jug
down
every
moment
the
snow
outlined
with
white
every
gable
and
cornice
of
the
beautiful
old
wooden
houses
the
moonlight
shone
on
the
gilded
signs
the
lambs
the
grapes
the
eagles
and
all
the
quaint
devices
that
hung
before
the
doors
covered
lamps
burned
before
the
nativities
and
crucifixions
painted
on
the
walls
or
let
into
the
here
and
there
where
a
shutter
had
not
been
closed
a
ruddy
lit
up
a
homely
interior
with
the
noisy
band
of
children
clustering
round
the
and
a
big
brown
loaf
or
some
gossips
spinning
and
listening
to
the
or
the
story
of
a
neighbor
while
the
glimmered
and
the
blazed
and
the
chestnuts
sputtered
in
their
iron
little
august
saw
all
these
things
as
he
saw
everything
with
his
two
big
bright
eyes
that
had
such
curious
lights
and
shadows
in
them
but
he
went
heedfully
on
his
way
for
the
sake
of
the
beer
which
a
single
slip
of
the
foot
would
make
him
spill
at
his
knock
and
call
the
solid
oak
door
four
centuries
old
if
one
flew
open
and
the
boy
darted
in
with
his
beer
and
shouted
with
all
the
force
of
mirthful
lungs
dear
hirschvogel
but
for
the
thought
of
you
i
should
have
died
it
was
a
large
barren
room
into
which
he
rushed
with
so
much
pleasure
and
the
bricks
were
bare
and
uneven
it
had
a
press
handsome
and
very
old
a
broad
deal
table
and
several
wooden
stools
for
all
its
furniture
but
at
the
top
of
the
chamber
sending
out
warmth
and
color
together
as
the
lamp
shed
its
rays
upon
it
was
a
tower
of
porcelain
burnished
with
all
the
hues
of
a
peacock
and
a
jewels
and
surmounted
with
armed
figures
and
shields
and
flowers
of
heraldry
and
a
great
golden
crown
upon
the
highest
summit
of
all
it
was
a
stove
of
and
on
it
were
the
letters
for
it
was
in
every
portion
the
handwork
of
the
great
potter
of
nürnberg
augustin
hirschvogel
who
put
his
mark
thus
as
all
the
world
knows
the
stove
no
doubt
had
stood
in
palaces
and
been
made
for
princes
had
warmed
the
crimson
stockings
of
cardinals
and
the
shoes
of
archduchesses
had
glowed
in
and
lent
its
carbon
to
help
kindle
sharp
brains
in
anxious
councils
of
state
no
one
knew
what
it
had
seen
or
done
or
been
fashioned
for
but
it
was
a
right
royal
thing
yet
perhaps
it
had
never
been
more
useful
than
it
was
now
in
this
poor
desolate
room
sending
down
heat
and
comfort
into
the
troop
of
children
tumbled
together
on
a
at
its
feet
who
received
frozen
august
among
them
with
loud
shouts
of
joy
dear
hirschvogel
i
am
so
cold
so
cold
said
august
kissing
its
gilded
claws
father
not
in
dorothea
dear
he
is
dorothea
was
a
girl
of
seventeen
and
serious
and
with
a
sweet
sad
face
for
she
had
had
many
cares
laid
on
her
shoulders
even
whilst
still
a
mere
baby
she
was
the
eldest
of
the
strehla
family
and
there
were
ten
of
them
in
all
next
to
her
there
came
jan
and
karl
and
otho
big
lads
gaining
a
little
for
their
own
living
and
then
came
august
who
went
up
in
the
summer
to
the
high
alps
with
the
cattle
but
in
winter
could
do
nothing
to
fill
his
own
little
platter
and
pot
and
then
all
the
little
ones
who
could
only
open
their
mouths
to
be
fed
like
young
birds
and
hilda
and
waldo
and
christof
and
last
of
all
little
ermengilda
with
eyes
like
whose
birth
had
cost
them
the
life
of
their
mother
they
were
of
that
mixed
race
half
austrian
half
italian
so
common
in
the
tyrol
some
of
the
children
were
white
and
golden
as
lilies
others
were
brown
and
brilliant
as
chestnuts
the
father
was
a
good
man
but
weak
and
weary
with
so
many
to
find
for
and
so
little
to
do
it
with
he
worked
at
the
and
by
that
gained
a
few
florins
people
said
he
would
have
worked
better
and
kept
his
family
more
easily
if
he
had
not
loved
his
pipe
and
a
draught
of
ale
too
well
but
this
had
only
been
said
of
him
after
his
death
when
trouble
and
perplexity
had
begun
to
dull
a
brain
never
too
vigorous
and
to
enfeeble
further
a
character
already
too
yielding
as
it
was
the
wolf
often
bayed
at
the
door
of
the
strehla
household
without
a
wolf
from
the
mountains
coming
down
dorothea
was
one
of
those
maidens
who
almost
work
miracles
so
far
can
their
industry
and
care
and
intelligence
make
a
home
sweet
and
wholesome
and
a
single
loaf
seem
to
swell
into
twenty
the
children
were
always
clean
and
happy
and
the
table
was
seldom
without
its
big
pot
of
soup
once
a
day
still
very
poor
they
were
and
heart
ached
with
shame
for
she
knew
that
their
debts
were
many
for
flour
and
meat
and
clothing
of
fuel
to
feed
the
big
stove
they
had
always
enough
without
cost
for
their
father
was
alive
and
sold
wood
and
fir
cones
and
coke
and
never
grudged
them
to
his
grandchildren
though
he
grumbled
at
improvidence
and
hapless
dreamy
ways
says
we
are
never
to
wait
for
him
we
will
have
supper
now
you
have
come
home
dear
said
dorothea
who
however
she
might
fret
her
soul
in
secret
as
she
knitted
their
hose
and
mended
their
shirts
never
let
her
anxieties
cast
a
gloom
on
the
children
only
to
august
she
did
speak
a
little
sometimes
because
he
was
so
thoughtful
and
so
tender
of
her
always
and
knew
as
well
as
she
did
that
there
were
troubles
about
money
these
troubles
were
vague
to
them
both
and
the
debtors
were
patient
and
kindly
being
neighbors
all
in
the
old
twisting
streets
between
the
and
the
river
supper
was
a
huge
bowl
of
soup
with
big
slices
of
brown
bread
swimming
in
it
and
some
onions
bobbing
up
and
down
the
bowl
was
soon
emptied
by
ten
wooden
spoons
and
then
the
three
eldest
boys
slipped
off
to
bed
being
tired
with
their
rough
bodily
labor
in
the
snow
all
day
and
dorothea
drew
her
by
the
stove
and
set
it
whirring
and
the
little
ones
got
august
down
upon
the
old
worn
and
clamored
to
him
for
a
picture
or
a
story
for
august
was
the
artist
of
the
family
he
had
a
piece
of
planed
deal
that
his
father
had
given
him
and
some
sticks
of
charcoal
and
he
would
draw
a
hundred
things
he
had
seen
in
the
day
sweeping
each
out
with
his
elbow
when
the
children
had
seen
enough
of
it
and
sketching
another
in
its
stead
and
heads
and
men
in
sledges
and
old
women
in
their
furs
and
and
cocks
and
hens
and
all
sorts
of
animals
and
now
and
madonna
and
child
it
was
all
very
rough
for
there
was
no
one
to
teach
him
anything
but
it
was
all
and
kept
the
whole
troop
of
children
shrieking
with
laughter
or
watching
breathless
with
wide
open
wondering
awed
eyes
they
were
all
so
happy
what
did
they
care
for
the
snow
outside
their
little
bodies
were
warm
and
their
hearts
merry
even
dorothea
troubled
about
the
bread
for
the
morrow
laughed
as
she
spun
and
august
with
all
his
soul
in
his
work
and
little
rosy
cheek
on
his
shoulder
glowing
after
his
frozen
afternoon
cried
out
loud
smiling
as
he
looked
up
at
the
stove
that
was
shedding
its
heat
down
on
them
all
dear
hirschvogel
you
are
almost
as
great
and
good
as
the
sun
no
you
are
greater
and
better
i
think
because
he
goes
away
nobody
knows
where
all
these
long
dark
cold
hours
and
does
not
care
how
people
die
for
want
of
him
but
are
always
ready
just
a
little
bit
of
wood
to
feed
you
and
you
will
make
a
summer
for
us
all
the
winter
through
the
grand
old
stove
seemed
to
smile
through
all
its
iridescent
surface
at
the
praises
of
the
child
no
doubt
the
stove
though
it
had
known
three
centuries
and
more
had
known
but
very
little
gratitude
it
was
one
of
those
magnificent
stoves
in
enamelled
faïence
which
so
excited
the
jealousy
of
the
other
potters
of
nürnberg
that
in
a
body
they
demanded
of
the
magistracy
that
augustin
hirschvogel
should
be
forbidden
to
make
any
more
of
them
magistracy
happily
proving
of
a
broader
mind
and
having
no
sympathy
with
the
wish
of
the
artisans
to
cripple
their
greater
fellow
it
was
of
great
height
and
breadth
with
all
the
majolica
lustre
which
hirschvogel
learned
to
give
to
his
enamels
when
he
was
making
love
to
the
young
venetian
girl
whom
he
afterwards
married
there
was
the
statue
of
a
king
at
each
corner
modelled
with
as
much
force
and
splendor
as
his
friend
albrecht
dürer
could
have
given
unto
them
on
copperplate
or
canvas
the
body
of
the
stove
itself
was
divided
into
panels
which
had
the
ages
of
man
painted
on
them
in
polychrome
the
borders
of
the
panels
had
roses
and
holly
and
laurel
and
other
foliage
and
german
mottoes
in
black
letter
of
odd
moralizing
such
as
the
old
teutons
and
the
dutch
after
them
love
to
have
on
their
and
their
their
dishes
and
flagons
the
whole
was
burnished
with
gilding
in
many
parts
and
was
radiant
everywhere
with
that
brilliant
coloring
of
which
the
hirschvogel
family
painters
on
glass
and
great
in
chemistry
as
they
were
were
all
masters
the
stove
was
a
very
grand
thing
as
i
say
possibly
hirschvogel
had
made
it
for
some
mighty
lord
of
the
tyrol
at
that
time
when
he
was
an
imperial
guest
at
innspruck
and
fashioned
so
many
things
for
the
schloss
amras
and
beautiful
philippine
welser
the
daughter
who
gained
an
heart
by
her
beauty
and
the
right
to
wear
his
honors
by
her
wit
nothing
was
known
of
the
stove
at
this
latter
day
in
hall
the
grandfather
strehla
who
had
been
a
had
dug
it
up
out
of
some
ruins
where
he
was
building
and
finding
it
without
a
flaw
had
taken
it
home
and
only
thought
it
worth
finding
because
it
was
such
a
good
one
to
burn
that
was
now
sixty
years
past
and
ever
since
then
the
stove
had
stood
in
the
big
desolate
empty
room
warming
three
generations
of
the
strehla
family
and
having
seen
nothing
prettier
perhaps
in
all
its
many
years
than
the
children
tumbled
now
in
a
cluster
like
gathered
flowers
at
its
feet
for
the
strehla
children
born
to
nothing
else
were
all
born
with
beauty
white
or
brown
they
were
equally
lovely
to
look
upon
and
when
they
went
into
the
church
to
mass
with
their
curling
locks
and
their
clasped
hands
they
stood
under
the
grim
statues
like
cherubs
flown
down
off
some
fresco
us
a
story
august
they
cried
in
chorus
when
they
had
seen
charcoal
pictures
till
they
were
tired
and
august
did
as
he
did
every
night
pretty
nearly
up
at
the
stove
and
told
them
what
he
imagined
of
the
many
adventures
and
joys
and
sorrows
of
the
human
being
who
figured
on
the
panels
from
his
cradle
to
his
grave
to
the
children
the
stove
was
a
household
god
in
summer
they
laid
a
mat
of
fresh
moss
all
round
it
and
dressed
it
up
with
green
boughs
and
the
numberless
beautiful
wild
flowers
of
the
tyrol
country
in
winter
all
their
joys
centred
in
it
and
scampering
home
from
school
over
the
ice
and
snow
they
were
happy
knowing
that
they
would
soon
be
cracking
nuts
or
roasting
chestnuts
in
the
broad
ardent
glow
of
its
noble
tower
which
rose
eight
feet
high
above
them
with
all
its
spires
and
pinnacles
and
crowns
once
a
travelling
peddler
had
told
them
that
the
letters
on
it
meant
augustin
hirschvogel
and
that
hirschvogel
had
been
a
great
german
potter
and
painter
like
his
father
before
him
in
the
city
of
nürnberg
and
had
made
many
such
stoves
that
were
all
miracles
of
beauty
and
of
workmanship
putting
all
his
heart
and
his
soul
and
his
faith
into
his
labors
as
the
men
of
those
earlier
ages
did
and
thinking
but
little
of
gold
or
praise
an
old
trader
too
who
sold
curiosities
not
far
from
the
church
had
told
august
a
little
more
about
the
brave
family
of
hirschvogel
whose
houses
can
be
seen
in
nürnberg
to
this
day
of
old
veit
the
first
of
them
who
painted
the
gothic
windows
of
sebald
with
the
marriage
of
the
margravine
of
his
sons
and
of
his
grandsons
potters
painters
engravers
all
and
chief
of
them
great
augustin
the
luca
della
robbia
of
the
north
and
imagination
always
quick
had
made
a
living
personage
out
of
these
few
records
and
saw
hirschvogel
as
though
he
were
in
the
flesh
walking
up
and
down
the
in
his
visit
to
innspruck
and
maturing
beautiful
things
in
his
brain
as
he
stood
on
the
bridge
and
gazed
on
the
flood
of
the
inn
so
the
stove
had
got
to
be
called
hirschvogel
in
the
family
as
if
it
were
a
living
creature
and
little
august
was
very
proud
because
he
had
been
named
after
that
famous
old
dead
german
who
had
had
the
genius
to
make
so
glorious
a
thing
all
the
children
loved
the
stove
but
with
august
the
love
of
it
was
a
passion
and
in
his
secret
heart
he
used
to
say
to
himself
i
am
a
man
i
will
make
just
such
things
too
and
then
i
will
set
hirschvogel
in
a
beautiful
room
in
a
house
that
i
will
build
myself
in
innspruck
just
outside
the
gates
where
the
chestnuts
are
by
the
river
that
is
what
i
will
do
when
i
am
a
for
august
a
son
and
a
little
when
he
was
anything
was
a
dreamer
of
dreams
and
when
he
was
upon
the
high
alps
with
his
cattle
with
the
stillness
and
the
sky
around
him
was
quite
certain
that
he
would
live
for
greater
things
than
driving
the
herds
up
when
the
came
among
the
blue
sea
of
gentians
or
toiling
down
in
the
town
with
wood
and
with
timber
as
his
father
and
grandfather
did
every
day
of
their
lives
he
was
a
strong
and
healthy
little
fellow
fed
on
the
free
and
he
was
very
happy
and
loved
his
family
devotedly
and
was
as
active
as
a
squirrel
and
as
playful
as
a
hare
but
he
kept
his
thoughts
to
himself
and
some
of
them
went
a
very
long
way
for
a
little
boy
who
was
only
one
among
many
and
to
whom
nobody
had
ever
paid
any
attention
except
to
teach
him
his
letters
and
tell
him
to
fear
god
august
in
winter
was
only
a
little
hungry
trotting
to
be
catechised
by
the
priest
or
to
bring
the
loaves
from
the
or
to
carry
his
boots
to
the
cobbler
and
in
summer
he
was
only
one
of
hundreds
of
who
drove
the
poor
blinking
stumbling
cattle
ringing
their
out
into
the
sweet
intoxication
of
the
sudden
sunlight
and
lived
up
with
them
in
the
heights
among
the
alpine
roses
with
only
the
clouds
and
the
near
but
he
was
always
thinking
thinking
thinking
for
all
that
and
under
his
little
sheepskin
winter
coat
and
his
rough
hempen
summer
shirt
his
heart
had
as
much
courage
in
it
as
ever
had
hofer
who
is
a
household
word
in
all
the
innthal
and
whom
august
always
reverently
remembered
when
he
went
to
the
city
of
innspruck
and
ran
out
by
the
foaming
and
under
the
wooded
height
of
berg
isel
august
lay
now
in
the
warmth
of
the
stove
and
told
the
children
stories
his
own
little
brown
face
growing
red
with
excitement
as
his
imagination
glowed
to
that
human
being
on
the
panels
who
was
drawn
there
as
a
baby
in
a
cradle
as
a
boy
playing
among
flowers
as
a
lover
sighing
under
a
casement
as
a
soldier
in
the
midst
of
strife
as
a
father
with
children
round
him
as
a
weary
old
blind
man
on
crutches
and
lastly
as
a
ransomed
soul
raised
up
by
angels
had
always
had
the
most
intense
interest
for
august
and
he
had
made
not
one
history
for
him
but
a
thousand
he
seldom
told
them
the
same
tale
twice
he
had
never
seen
a
in
his
life
his
primer
and
his
were
all
the
volumes
he
had
but
nature
had
given
him
fancy
and
she
is
a
good
fairy
that
makes
up
for
the
want
of
very
many
things
only
alas
her
wings
are
so
very
soon
broken
poor
thing
and
then
she
is
of
no
use
at
all
is
time
for
you
all
to
go
to
bed
children
said
dorothea
looking
up
from
her
spinning
is
very
late
you
must
not
sit
up
for
five
minutes
more
dear
dorothea
they
pleaded
and
little
rosy
and
golden
ermengilda
climbed
up
into
her
lap
is
so
warm
the
beds
are
never
so
warm
as
he
can
not
you
tell
us
another
tale
august
cried
august
whose
face
had
lost
its
light
now
that
his
story
had
come
to
an
end
and
who
sat
serious
with
his
hands
clasped
on
his
knees
gazing
on
to
the
luminous
arabesques
of
the
stove
is
only
a
week
to
christmas
he
said
suddenly
big
cakes
chuckled
little
christof
who
was
five
years
old
and
thought
christmas
meant
a
big
cake
and
nothing
else
will
santa
claus
find
for
if
she
be
good
murmured
dorothea
over
the
sunny
head
for
however
hard
poverty
might
pinch
it
could
never
pinch
so
tightly
that
dorothea
would
not
find
some
wooden
toy
and
some
rosy
apples
to
put
in
her
little
socks
max
has
promised
me
a
big
goose
because
i
saved
the
life
in
june
said
august
it
was
the
twentieth
time
he
had
told
them
so
that
month
he
was
so
proud
of
it
aunt
maïla
will
be
sure
to
send
us
wine
and
honey
and
a
barrel
of
flour
she
always
does
said
albrecht
their
aunt
maïla
had
a
chalet
and
a
little
farm
over
on
the
green
slopes
towards
dorp
ampas
shall
go
up
into
the
woods
and
get
crown
said
august
they
always
crowned
hirschvogel
for
christmas
with
pine
boughs
and
ivy
and
the
heat
soon
withered
the
crown
but
it
was
part
of
the
religion
of
the
day
to
them
as
much
so
as
it
was
to
cross
themselves
in
church
and
raise
their
voices
in
the
salutaris
and
they
fell
chatting
of
all
they
would
do
on
the
and
one
little
voice
piped
loud
against
and
they
were
as
happy
as
though
their
stockings
would
be
full
of
golden
purses
and
jewelled
toys
and
the
big
goose
in
the
seemed
to
them
such
a
meal
as
kings
would
envy
in
the
midst
of
their
chatter
and
laughter
a
blast
of
frozen
air
and
a
spray
of
driven
snow
struck
like
ice
through
the
room
and
reached
them
even
in
the
warmth
of
the
old
and
the
great
stove
it
was
the
door
which
had
opened
and
let
in
the
cold
it
was
their
father
who
had
come
home
the
younger
children
ran
joyous
to
meet
him
dorothea
pushed
the
one
wooden
of
the
room
to
the
stove
and
august
flew
to
set
the
jug
of
beer
on
a
little
round
table
and
fill
a
long
clay
pipe
for
their
father
was
good
to
them
all
and
seldom
raised
his
voice
in
anger
and
they
had
been
trained
by
the
mother
they
had
loved
to
dutifulness
and
obedience
and
a
watchful
affection
karl
strehla
responded
very
wearily
to
the
young
welcome
and
came
to
the
wooden
chair
with
a
tired
step
and
sat
down
heavily
not
noticing
either
pipe
or
beer
you
not
well
dear
father
his
daughter
asked
him
am
well
enough
he
answered
dully
and
sat
there
with
his
head
bent
letting
the
lighted
pipe
grow
cold
he
was
a
fair
tall
man
gray
before
his
time
and
bowed
with
labor
the
children
to
bed
he
said
suddenly
at
last
and
dorothea
obeyed
august
stayed
behind
curled
before
the
stove
at
nine
years
old
and
when
one
earns
money
in
the
summer
from
the
farmers
one
is
not
altogether
a
child
any
more
at
least
in
own
estimation
august
did
not
heed
his
silence
he
was
used
to
it
karl
strehla
was
a
man
of
few
words
and
being
of
weakly
health
was
usually
too
tired
at
the
end
of
the
day
to
do
more
than
drink
his
beer
and
sleep
august
lay
on
the
dreamy
and
comfortable
looking
up
through
his
drooping
eyelids
at
the
golden
coronets
on
the
crest
of
the
great
stove
and
wondering
for
the
millionth
time
whom
it
had
been
made
for
and
what
grand
places
and
scenes
it
had
known
dorothea
came
down
from
putting
the
little
ones
in
their
beds
the
in
the
corner
struck
eight
she
looked
to
her
father
and
the
untouched
pipe
then
sat
down
to
her
spinning
saying
nothing
she
thought
he
had
been
drinking
in
some
tavern
it
had
been
often
so
with
him
of
late
there
was
a
long
silence
the
cuckoo
called
the
quarter
twice
august
dropped
asleep
his
curls
falling
over
his
face
wheel
hummed
like
a
cat
suddenly
karl
strehla
struck
his
hand
on
the
table
sending
the
pipe
on
the
ground
have
sold
hirschvogel
he
said
and
his
voice
was
husky
and
ashamed
in
his
throat
the
stopped
august
sprang
erect
out
of
his
sleep
hirschvogel
if
their
father
had
dashed
the
holy
crucifix
on
the
floor
at
their
feet
and
spat
on
it
they
could
not
have
shuddered
under
the
horror
of
a
greater
blasphemy
have
sold
hirschvogel
said
karl
strehla
in
the
same
husky
dogged
voice
have
sold
it
to
a
travelling
trader
in
such
things
for
two
hundred
florins
what
would
you
owe
double
that
he
saw
it
this
morning
when
you
were
all
out
he
will
pack
it
and
take
it
to
munich
dorothea
gave
a
low
shrill
cry
father
she
turned
white
as
the
snow
without
her
words
died
away
in
her
throat
august
stood
half
blind
with
sleep
staring
with
dazed
eyes
as
his
cattle
stared
at
the
sun
when
they
came
out
from
their
prison
is
not
true
it
is
not
true
he
muttered
are
jesting
father
strehla
broke
into
a
dreary
laugh
is
true
would
you
like
to
know
what
is
true
too
the
bread
you
eat
and
the
meat
you
put
in
this
pot
and
the
roof
you
have
over
your
heads
are
none
of
them
paid
for
have
been
none
of
them
paid
for
for
months
and
months
if
it
had
not
been
for
your
grandfather
i
should
have
been
in
prison
all
summer
and
autumn
and
he
is
out
of
patience
and
will
do
no
more
now
there
is
no
work
to
be
had
the
masters
go
to
younger
men
they
say
i
work
ill
it
may
be
so
who
can
keep
his
head
above
water
with
ten
hungry
children
dragging
him
down
when
your
mother
lived
it
was
different
boy
you
stare
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
mad
dog
you
have
made
a
god
of
yon
china
thing
goes
goes
two
hundred
florins
that
is
something
it
will
keep
me
out
of
prison
for
a
little
and
with
the
spring
things
may
august
stood
like
a
creature
paralyzed
his
eyes
were
wide
open
fastened
on
his
with
terror
and
incredulous
horror
his
face
had
grown
as
white
as
his
his
chest
heaved
with
tearless
sobs
is
not
true
it
is
not
true
he
echoed
stupidly
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
very
skies
must
fall
and
the
earth
perish
if
they
could
take
away
hirschvogel
they
might
as
soon
talk
of
tearing
down
sun
out
of
the
heavens
will
find
it
true
said
his
father
doggedly
and
angered
because
he
was
in
his
own
soul
bitterly
ashamed
to
have
bartered
away
the
heirloom
and
treasure
of
his
race
and
the
comfort
and
of
his
young
children
will
find
it
true
the
dealer
has
paid
me
half
the
money
and
will
pay
me
the
other
half
when
he
packs
it
up
and
takes
it
away
to
munich
no
doubt
it
is
worth
a
great
deal
more
least
i
suppose
so
as
he
gives
that
beggars
can
not
be
choosers
the
little
black
stove
in
the
kitchen
will
warm
you
all
just
as
well
who
would
keep
a
gilded
painted
thing
in
a
poor
house
like
this
when
one
can
make
two
hundred
florins
by
it
dorothea
you
never
sobbed
more
when
your
mother
died
what
is
it
when
all
is
said
bit
of
hardware
much
too
for
such
a
room
as
this
if
all
the
strehlas
had
not
been
born
fools
it
would
have
been
sold
a
century
ago
when
it
was
dug
up
out
of
the
ground
is
a
stove
for
a
museum
the
trader
said
when
he
saw
it
to
a
museum
let
it
august
gave
a
shrill
shriek
like
a
when
it
is
caught
for
its
death
and
threw
himself
on
his
knees
at
his
feet
father
father
he
cried
convulsively
his
hands
closing
on
knees
and
his
uplifted
face
blanched
and
distorted
with
terror
father
dear
father
you
can
not
mean
what
you
say
send
life
our
sun
our
joy
our
comfort
we
shall
all
die
in
the
dark
and
the
cold
sell
rather
sell
me
to
any
trade
or
any
pain
you
like
i
will
not
mind
but
hirschvogel
is
like
selling
the
very
cross
off
the
altar
you
must
be
in
jest
you
could
not
do
such
a
could
not
who
have
always
been
gentle
and
good
and
who
have
sat
in
the
warmth
here
year
after
year
with
our
mother
it
is
not
a
piece
of
hardware
as
you
say
it
is
a
living
thing
for
a
great
thoughts
and
fancies
have
put
life
into
it
and
it
loves
us
though
we
are
only
poor
little
children
and
we
love
it
with
all
our
hearts
and
souls
and
up
in
heaven
i
am
sure
the
dead
hirschvogel
knows
oh
listen
i
will
go
and
try
and
get
work
i
will
ask
them
to
let
me
cut
ice
or
make
the
paths
through
the
snow
there
must
be
something
i
could
do
and
i
will
beg
the
people
we
owe
money
to
to
wait
they
are
all
neighbors
they
will
be
patient
but
sell
hirschvogel
never
never
never
give
the
florins
back
to
the
vile
man
tell
him
it
would
be
like
selling
the
shroud
out
of
coffin
or
the
golden
curls
off
head
oh
father
dear
father
do
hear
me
for
sake
strehla
was
moved
by
the
anguish
he
loved
his
children
though
he
was
often
weary
of
them
and
their
pain
was
pain
to
him
but
besides
emotion
and
stronger
than
emotion
was
the
anger
that
august
roused
in
him
he
hated
and
despised
himself
for
the
barter
of
the
heirloom
of
his
race
and
every
word
of
the
child
stung
him
with
a
stinging
sense
of
shame
and
he
spoke
in
his
wrath
rather
than
in
his
sorrow
are
a
little
fool
he
said
harshly
as
they
had
never
heard
him
speak
rave
like
a
get
up
and
go
to
bed
the
stove
is
sold
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
children
like
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
such
matters
the
stove
is
sold
and
goes
to
munich
what
is
it
to
you
be
thankful
i
can
get
bread
for
you
get
on
your
legs
i
say
and
go
to
strehla
took
up
the
jug
of
ale
as
he
paused
and
drained
it
slowly
as
a
man
who
had
no
cares
august
sprang
to
his
feet
and
threw
his
hair
back
off
his
face
the
blood
rushed
into
his
cheeks
making
them
scarlet
his
great
soft
eyes
flamed
alight
with
furious
passion
not
he
cried
aloud
dare
not
sell
it
i
say
it
is
not
yours
alone
it
is
strehla
flung
the
emptied
jug
on
the
bricks
with
a
force
that
shivered
it
to
atoms
and
rising
to
his
feet
struck
his
son
a
blow
that
felled
him
to
the
floor
it
was
the
first
time
in
all
his
life
that
he
had
ever
raised
his
hand
against
any
one
of
his
children
then
he
took
the
that
stood
at
his
elbow
and
stumbled
off
to
his
own
chamber
with
a
cloud
before
his
eyes
has
happened
said
august
a
little
while
later
as
he
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
dorothea
weeping
above
him
on
the
before
the
stove
he
had
been
struck
backward
and
his
head
had
fallen
on
the
hard
bricks
where
the
did
not
reach
he
sat
up
a
moment
with
his
face
bent
upon
his
hands
remember
now
he
said
very
low
under
his
breath
dorothea
showered
kisses
on
him
while
her
tears
fell
like
rain
oh
dear
how
could
you
speak
so
to
father
she
murmured
was
very
i
was
right
said
august
and
his
little
mouth
that
hitherto
had
only
curled
in
laughter
curved
downward
with
a
fixed
and
bitter
seriousness
dare
he
how
dare
he
he
muttered
with
his
head
sunk
in
his
hands
is
not
his
alone
it
belongs
to
us
all
it
is
as
much
yours
and
mine
as
it
is
illustration
is
a
sin
it
is
a
theft
it
is
an
infamy
he
said
dorothea
could
only
sob
in
answer
she
was
too
frightened
to
speak
the
authority
of
their
parents
in
the
house
had
never
in
her
remembrance
been
questioned
you
hurt
by
the
fall
dear
august
she
murmured
at
length
for
he
looked
to
her
so
pale
and
strange
i
do
not
know
what
does
it
matter
he
sat
up
upon
the
with
passionate
pain
upon
his
face
all
his
soul
was
in
rebellion
and
he
was
only
a
child
and
was
powerless
is
a
sin
it
is
a
theft
it
is
an
infamy
he
said
slowly
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
gilded
feet
of
hirschvogel
august
do
not
say
such
things
of
father
sobbed
his
sister
he
does
we
ought
to
think
it
august
laughed
aloud
it
right
that
he
should
spend
his
money
in
drink
he
should
let
orders
lie
unexecuted
he
should
do
his
work
so
ill
that
no
one
cares
to
employ
him
he
should
live
on
charity
and
then
dare
sell
a
thing
that
is
ours
every
whit
as
much
as
it
is
his
to
sell
hirschvogel
oh
dear
god
i
would
sooner
sell
my
soul
cried
dorothea
with
piteous
entreaty
he
terrified
her
she
could
not
recognize
her
little
gay
gentle
brother
in
those
fierce
and
blasphemous
words
august
laughed
aloud
again
then
all
at
once
his
laughter
broke
down
into
bitterest
weeping
he
threw
himself
forward
on
the
stove
covering
it
with
kisses
and
sobbing
as
though
his
heart
would
burst
from
his
bosom
what
could
he
do
nothing
nothing
nothing
dear
august
whispered
dorothea
piteously
and
trembling
all
over
she
was
a
very
gentle
girl
and
fierce
feeling
terrified
her
do
not
lie
there
come
to
bed
it
is
quite
late
in
the
morning
you
will
be
calmer
it
is
horrible
indeed
and
we
shall
die
of
cold
at
least
the
little
ones
but
if
it
be
me
alone
said
august
through
his
teeth
striving
to
still
the
storm
of
sobs
that
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
me
alone
in
the
morning
can
you
speak
of
the
morning
to
bed
dear
sighed
his
sister
august
do
not
lie
and
look
like
that
you
frighten
me
do
come
to
shall
stay
all
night
might
take
it
in
the
night
besides
to
leave
it
now
it
is
cold
the
fire
is
will
never
be
warm
any
more
nor
shall
all
his
childhood
had
gone
out
of
him
all
his
gleeful
careless
sunny
temper
had
gone
with
it
he
spoke
sullenly
and
wearily
choking
down
the
great
sobs
in
his
chest
to
him
it
was
as
if
the
end
of
the
world
had
come
his
sister
lingered
by
him
while
striving
to
persuade
him
to
go
to
his
place
in
the
little
crowded
bedchamber
with
albrecht
and
waldo
and
christof
but
it
was
in
vain
shall
stay
here
was
all
he
answered
her
and
he
stayed
the
night
long
the
lamps
went
out
the
rats
came
and
ran
across
the
floor
as
the
hours
crept
on
through
midnight
and
past
the
cold
intensified
and
the
air
of
the
room
grew
like
ice
august
did
not
move
he
lay
with
his
face
downward
on
the
golden
and
pedestal
of
the
household
treasure
which
henceforth
was
to
be
cold
for
evermore
an
exiled
thing
in
a
foreign
city
in
a
land
whilst
yet
it
was
dark
his
three
elder
brothers
came
down
the
stairs
and
let
themselves
out
each
bearing
his
lantern
and
going
to
his
work
in
and
and
at
the
they
did
not
notice
him
they
did
not
know
what
had
happened
a
little
later
his
sister
came
down
with
a
light
in
her
hand
to
make
ready
the
house
ere
morning
should
break
she
stole
up
to
him
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
timidly
august
you
must
be
frozen
august
do
look
up
do
speak
august
raised
his
eyes
with
a
wild
feverish
sullen
look
in
them
that
she
had
never
seen
there
his
face
was
ashen
white
his
lips
were
like
fire
he
had
not
slept
all
night
but
his
passionate
sobs
had
given
way
to
delirious
waking
dreams
and
numb
senseless
trances
which
had
alternated
one
on
another
all
through
the
freezing
lonely
horrible
hours
will
never
be
warm
again
he
muttered
again
dorothea
clasped
him
with
trembling
hands
do
you
not
know
me
she
cried
in
an
agony
am
dorothea
wake
up
up
it
is
morning
only
so
dark
august
shuddered
all
over
morning
he
echoed
he
slowly
rose
up
on
to
his
feet
will
go
to
grandfather
he
said
very
low
is
always
good
perhaps
he
could
save
loud
blows
with
the
heavy
iron
knocker
of
the
drowned
his
words
a
strange
voice
called
aloud
through
the
keyhole
me
in
quick
is
no
time
to
lose
more
snow
like
this
and
the
roads
will
all
be
blocked
let
me
in
do
you
hear
i
am
come
to
take
the
great
august
sprang
erect
his
fists
doubled
his
eyes
blazing
shall
never
touch
it
he
screamed
shall
never
touch
it
shall
prevent
us
laughed
a
big
man
who
was
a
bavarian
amused
at
the
fierce
little
figure
fronting
him
said
august
shall
never
have
it
you
shall
kill
me
first
said
the
big
man
as
father
entered
the
room
have
got
a
little
mad
dog
here
muzzle
one
way
and
another
they
did
muzzle
him
he
fought
like
a
little
demon
and
hit
out
right
and
left
and
one
of
his
blows
gave
the
bavarian
a
black
eye
but
he
was
soon
mastered
by
four
grown
men
and
his
father
flung
him
with
no
light
hand
out
from
the
door
of
the
back
entrance
and
the
buyers
of
the
stately
and
beautiful
stove
set
to
work
to
pack
it
heedfully
and
carry
it
away
when
dorothea
stole
out
to
look
for
august
he
was
nowhere
in
sight
she
went
back
to
little
who
was
ailing
and
sobbed
over
the
child
whilst
the
others
stood
looking
on
dimly
understanding
that
with
hirschvogel
was
going
all
the
warmth
of
their
bodies
all
the
light
of
their
hearth
even
their
father
now
was
sorry
and
ashamed
but
two
hundred
florins
seemed
a
big
sum
to
him
and
after
all
he
thought
the
children
could
warm
themselves
quite
as
well
at
the
black
iron
stove
in
the
kitchen
besides
whether
he
regretted
it
now
or
not
the
work
of
the
nürnberg
potter
was
sold
irrevocably
and
he
had
to
stand
still
and
see
the
men
from
munich
wrap
it
in
manifold
wrappings
and
bear
it
out
into
the
snowy
air
to
where
an
stood
in
waiting
for
it
in
another
moment
hirschvogel
was
gone
forever
and
aye
august
had
stood
still
for
a
time
leaning
sick
and
faint
from
the
violence
that
had
been
used
to
him
against
the
back
wall
of
the
house
the
wall
looked
on
a
court
where
a
well
was
and
the
backs
of
other
houses
and
beyond
them
the
spire
of
the
muntze
tower
and
the
peaks
of
the
mountains
into
the
court
an
old
neighbor
hobbled
for
water
and
seeing
the
boy
said
to
him
is
it
true
your
father
is
selling
the
big
painted
stove
august
nodded
his
head
then
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
for
sure
he
is
a
fool
said
the
neighbor
forgive
me
for
calling
him
so
before
his
own
child
but
the
stove
was
worth
a
mint
of
money
i
do
remember
in
my
young
days
in
old
time
that
was
your
my
lad
a
stranger
from
vienna
saw
it
and
said
that
it
was
worth
its
weight
in
sobs
went
on
their
broken
impetuous
course
loved
it
i
loved
it
he
moaned
do
not
care
what
its
value
was
i
loved
it
loved
it
little
simpleton
said
the
old
man
kindly
you
are
wiser
than
your
father
when
said
if
sell
it
he
must
he
should
have
taken
it
to
good
herr
steiner
over
at
sprüz
who
would
have
given
him
honest
value
but
no
doubt
they
took
him
over
his
beer
ay
but
if
i
were
you
i
would
do
better
than
cry
i
would
go
after
august
raised
his
head
the
tears
raining
down
his
cheeks
after
it
when
you
are
bigger
said
the
neighbor
with
a
wish
to
cheer
him
up
a
little
world
is
a
small
thing
after
all
i
was
a
travelling
clockmaker
once
upon
a
time
and
i
know
that
your
stove
will
be
safe
enough
whoever
gets
it
anything
that
can
be
sold
for
a
round
sum
is
always
wrapped
up
in
cotton
wool
by
everybody
ay
ay
cry
so
much
you
will
see
your
stove
again
some
then
the
old
man
hobbled
away
to
draw
his
brazen
pail
full
of
water
at
the
well
august
remained
leaning
against
the
wall
his
head
was
buzzing
and
his
heart
fluttering
with
the
new
idea
which
had
presented
itself
to
his
mind
after
it
had
said
the
old
man
he
thought
not
go
with
it
he
loved
it
better
than
any
one
even
better
than
dorothea
and
he
shrank
from
the
thought
of
meeting
his
father
again
his
father
who
had
sold
hirschvogel
he
was
by
this
time
in
that
state
of
exaltation
in
which
the
impossible
looks
quite
natural
and
commonplace
his
tears
were
still
wet
on
his
pale
cheeks
but
they
had
ceased
to
fall
he
ran
out
of
the
by
a
little
gate
and
across
to
the
huge
gothic
porch
of
the
church
from
there
he
could
watch
unseen
his
at
which
were
always
hanging
some
pitchers
such
as
are
common
and
so
picturesque
in
austria
for
a
part
of
the
house
was
let
to
a
man
who
dealt
in
pottery
he
hid
himself
in
the
grand
portico
which
he
had
so
often
passed
through
to
go
to
mass
or
complin
within
and
presently
his
heart
gave
a
great
leap
for
he
saw
the
stove
brought
out
and
laid
with
infinite
care
on
the
two
of
the
bavarian
men
mounted
beside
it
and
the
slowly
crept
over
the
snow
of
the
place
crisp
and
hard
as
stone
the
noble
old
minster
looked
its
grandest
and
most
solemn
with
its
stone
and
its
vast
archways
and
its
porch
that
was
itself
as
big
as
many
a
church
and
its
strange
gargoyles
and
black
against
the
snow
on
its
roof
and
on
the
pavement
but
for
once
august
had
no
eyes
for
it
he
only
watched
for
his
old
friend
then
he
a
little
unnoticeable
figure
enough
like
a
score
of
other
boys
in
hall
crept
unseen
by
any
of
his
brothers
or
sisters
out
of
the
porch
and
over
the
shelving
uneven
square
and
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
dray
its
course
lay
towards
the
station
of
the
railway
which
is
close
to
the
whose
smoke
at
times
sullies
this
part
of
clean
little
hall
though
it
does
not
do
very
much
damage
from
hall
the
iron
road
runs
northward
through
glorious
country
to
salzburg
vienna
prague
buda
and
southward
over
the
brenner
into
italy
was
hirschvogel
going
north
or
south
this
at
least
he
would
soon
know
august
had
often
hung
about
the
little
station
watching
the
trains
come
and
go
and
dive
into
the
heart
of
the
hills
and
vanish
no
one
said
anything
to
him
for
idling
about
people
are
and
easy
of
temper
in
this
pleasant
land
and
children
and
dogs
are
both
happy
there
he
heard
the
bavarians
arguing
and
vociferating
a
great
deal
and
learned
that
they
meant
to
go
too
and
wanted
to
go
with
the
great
stove
itself
but
this
they
could
not
do
for
neither
could
the
stove
go
by
a
nor
they
themselves
go
in
a
so
at
length
they
insured
their
precious
burden
for
a
large
sum
and
consented
to
send
it
by
a
which
was
to
pass
through
hall
in
half
an
hour
the
swift
trains
seldom
deign
to
notice
the
existence
of
hall
at
all
august
heard
and
a
desperate
resolve
made
itself
up
in
his
little
mind
where
hirschvogel
went
would
he
go
he
gave
one
terrible
thought
to
gentle
dorothea
in
the
cold
at
home
then
set
to
work
to
execute
his
project
how
he
managed
it
he
never
knew
very
clearly
himself
but
certain
it
is
that
when
the
from
the
north
that
had
come
all
the
way
from
linz
on
the
danube
moved
out
of
hall
august
was
hidden
behind
the
stove
in
the
great
covered
truck
and
wedged
unseen
and
undreamt
of
by
any
human
creature
amidst
the
cases
of
of
clocks
and
of
vienna
toys
of
turkish
carpets
of
russian
skins
of
hungarian
wines
which
shared
the
same
abode
as
did
his
swathed
and
bound
hirschvogel
no
doubt
he
was
very
naughty
but
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
so
his
whole
mind
and
soul
were
absorbed
in
the
one
entrancing
idea
to
follow
his
beloved
friend
and
it
was
very
dark
in
the
closed
truck
which
had
only
a
little
window
above
the
door
and
it
was
crowded
and
had
a
strong
smell
in
it
from
the
russian
hides
and
the
hams
that
were
in
it
but
august
was
not
frightened
he
was
close
to
hirschvogel
and
presently
he
meant
to
be
closer
still
for
he
meant
to
do
nothing
less
than
get
inside
hirschvogel
itself
being
a
shrewd
little
boy
and
having
had
by
great
luck
two
silver
groschen
in
his
which
he
had
earned
the
day
before
by
chopping
wood
he
had
bought
some
bread
and
sausage
at
the
station
of
a
woman
there
who
knew
him
and
who
thought
he
was
going
out
to
his
uncle
chalet
above
jenbach
this
he
had
with
him
and
this
he
ate
in
the
darkness
and
the
lumbering
pounding
thundering
noise
which
made
him
giddy
as
never
had
he
been
in
a
train
of
any
kind
before
still
he
ate
having
had
no
breakfast
and
being
a
child
and
half
a
german
and
not
knowing
at
all
how
or
when
he
ever
would
eat
again
when
he
had
eaten
not
as
much
as
he
wanted
but
as
much
as
he
thought
was
prudent
for
who
could
say
when
he
would
be
able
to
buy
anything
more
he
set
to
work
like
a
little
mouse
to
make
a
hole
in
the
withes
of
straw
and
hay
which
enveloped
the
stove
if
it
had
been
put
in
a
he
would
have
been
defeated
at
the
onset
as
it
was
he
gnawed
and
nibbled
and
pulled
and
pushed
just
as
a
mouse
would
have
done
making
his
hole
where
he
guessed
that
the
opening
of
the
stove
was
opening
through
which
he
had
so
often
thrust
the
big
oak
logs
to
feed
it
no
one
disturbed
him
the
heavy
train
went
lumbering
on
and
on
and
he
saw
nothing
at
all
of
the
beautiful
mountains
and
shining
waters
and
great
forests
through
which
he
was
being
carried
he
was
hard
at
work
getting
through
the
straw
and
hay
and
twisted
ropes
and
get
through
them
at
last
he
did
and
found
the
door
of
the
stove
which
he
knew
so
well
and
which
was
quite
large
enough
for
a
child
of
his
age
to
slip
through
and
it
was
this
which
he
had
counted
upon
doing
slip
through
he
did
as
he
had
often
done
at
home
for
fun
and
curled
himself
up
there
to
see
if
he
could
anyhow
remain
during
many
hours
he
found
that
he
could
air
came
in
through
the
brass
of
the
stove
and
with
admirable
caution
in
such
a
little
fellow
he
leaned
out
drew
the
hay
and
straw
together
and
rearranged
the
ropes
so
that
no
one
could
ever
have
dreamed
a
little
mouse
had
been
at
them
then
he
curled
himself
up
again
this
time
more
like
a
dormouse
than
anything
else
and
being
safe
inside
his
dear
hirschvogel
and
intensely
cold
he
went
fast
asleep
as
if
he
were
in
his
own
bed
at
home
with
albrecht
and
christof
on
either
side
of
him
the
train
lumbered
on
stopping
often
and
long
as
the
habit
of
is
sweeping
the
snow
away
with
its
and
rumbling
through
the
deep
heart
of
the
mountains
with
its
lamps
aglow
like
the
eyes
of
a
dog
in
a
night
of
frost
the
train
rolled
on
in
its
heavy
slow
fashion
and
the
child
slept
soundly
for
a
long
while
when
he
did
awake
it
was
quite
dark
outside
in
the
land
he
could
not
see
and
of
course
he
was
in
absolute
darkness
and
for
a
while
he
was
sorely
frightened
and
trembled
terribly
and
sobbed
in
a
quiet
fashion
thinking
of
them
all
at
home
poor
dorothea
how
anxious
she
would
be
how
she
would
run
over
the
town
and
walk
up
to
at
dorf
ampas
and
perhaps
even
send
over
to
jenbach
thinking
he
had
taken
refuge
with
uncle
joachim
his
conscience
smote
him
for
the
sorrow
he
must
be
even
then
causing
to
his
gentle
sister
but
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
try
and
go
back
if
he
once
were
to
lose
sight
of
hirschvogel
how
could
he
ever
hope
to
find
it
again
how
could
he
ever
know
whither
it
had
gone
south
east
or
west
the
old
neighbor
had
said
that
the
world
was
small
but
august
knew
at
least
that
it
must
have
a
great
many
places
in
it
that
he
had
seen
himself
on
the
maps
on
his
walls
almost
any
other
little
boy
would
i
think
have
been
frightened
out
of
his
wits
at
the
position
in
which
he
found
himself
but
august
was
brave
and
he
had
a
firm
belief
that
god
and
hirschvogel
would
take
care
of
him
the
of
nürnberg
was
always
present
to
his
mind
a
kindly
benign
and
gracious
spirit
dwelling
manifestly
in
that
porcelain
tower
whereof
he
had
been
the
maker
a
droll
fancy
you
say
but
every
child
with
a
soul
in
him
has
quite
as
quaint
fancies
as
this
one
was
of
so
he
got
over
his
terror
and
his
sobbing
both
though
he
was
so
utterly
in
the
dark
he
did
not
feel
cramped
at
all
because
the
stove
was
so
large
and
air
he
had
in
plenty
as
it
came
through
the
running
round
the
top
he
was
hungry
again
and
again
nibbled
with
prudence
at
his
loaf
and
his
sausage
he
could
not
at
all
tell
the
hour
every
time
the
train
stopped
and
he
heard
the
banging
stamping
shouting
and
jangling
of
chains
that
went
on
his
heart
seemed
to
jump
up
into
his
mouth
if
they
should
find
him
out
sometimes
porters
came
and
took
away
this
case
and
the
other
a
sack
here
a
bale
there
now
a
big
bag
now
a
dead
chamois
every
time
the
men
trampled
near
him
and
swore
at
each
other
and
banged
this
and
that
to
and
fro
he
was
so
frightened
that
his
very
breath
seemed
to
stop
when
they
came
to
lift
the
stove
out
would
they
find
him
and
if
they
did
find
him
would
they
kill
him
that
was
what
he
kept
thinking
of
all
the
way
all
through
the
dark
hours
which
seemed
without
end
the
are
usually
very
slow
and
are
many
days
doing
what
a
quick
train
does
in
a
few
hours
this
one
was
quicker
than
most
because
it
was
bearing
goods
to
the
king
of
bavaria
still
it
took
all
the
short
day
and
the
long
night
and
half
another
day
to
go
over
ground
that
the
cover
in
a
forenoon
it
passed
great
armored
kuffstein
standing
across
the
beautiful
and
solemn
gorge
denying
the
right
of
way
to
all
the
foes
of
austria
it
passed
twelve
hours
later
after
lying
by
in
stations
pretty
rosenheim
that
marks
the
border
of
bavaria
and
here
the
nürnberg
stove
with
august
inside
it
was
lifted
out
heedfully
and
set
under
a
covered
way
when
it
was
lifted
out
the
boy
had
hard
work
to
keep
in
his
screams
he
was
tossed
to
and
fro
as
the
men
lifted
the
huge
thing
and
the
earthenware
walls
of
his
beloved
were
not
cushions
of
down
however
though
they
swore
and
grumbled
at
the
weight
of
it
they
never
suspected
that
a
living
child
was
inside
it
and
they
carried
it
out
on
to
the
platform
and
set
it
down
under
the
roof
of
the
there
it
passed
the
rest
of
the
night
and
all
the
next
morning
and
august
was
all
the
while
within
it
the
winds
of
early
winter
sweep
bitterly
over
rosenheim
and
all
the
vast
bavarian
plain
was
one
white
sheet
of
snow
if
there
had
not
been
whole
armies
of
men
at
work
always
clearing
the
iron
rails
of
the
snow
no
trains
could
ever
have
run
at
all
happily
for
august
the
thick
wrappings
in
which
the
stove
was
enveloped
and
the
stoutness
of
its
own
make
screened
him
from
the
cold
of
which
else
he
must
have
died
he
had
still
some
of
his
loaf
and
a
very
his
sausage
what
he
did
begin
to
suffer
from
was
thirst
and
this
frightened
him
almost
mere
than
anything
else
for
dorothea
had
read
aloud
to
them
one
night
a
story
of
the
tortures
some
wrecked
men
had
endured
because
they
could
not
find
any
water
but
the
salt
sea
it
was
many
hours
since
he
had
last
taken
a
drink
from
the
wooden
spout
of
their
old
pump
which
brought
them
the
sparkling
water
of
the
hills
but
fortunately
for
him
the
stove
having
been
marked
and
registered
as
and
valuable
was
not
treated
quite
like
a
mere
bale
of
goods
and
the
rosenheim
who
knew
its
consignees
resolved
to
send
it
on
by
a
that
would
leave
there
at
daybreak
and
when
this
train
went
out
in
it
among
piles
of
luggage
belonging
to
other
travellers
to
vienna
prague
salzburg
was
august
still
undiscovered
still
doubled
up
like
a
mole
in
the
winter
under
the
grass
those
words
and
valuable
had
made
the
men
lift
hirschvogel
gently
and
with
care
he
had
begun
to
get
used
to
his
prison
and
a
little
used
to
the
incessant
pounding
and
jumbling
and
rattling
and
shaking
with
which
modern
travel
is
always
accompanied
though
modern
invention
does
deem
itself
so
mightily
clever
all
in
the
dark
he
was
and
he
was
terribly
thirsty
but
he
kept
feeling
the
earthenware
sides
of
the
nürnberg
giant
and
saying
softly
care
of
me
oh
take
care
of
me
dear
hirschvogel
he
did
not
say
me
back
for
now
that
he
was
fairly
out
in
the
world
he
wished
to
see
a
little
of
it
he
began
to
think
that
they
must
have
been
all
over
the
world
in
all
this
time
that
the
rolling
and
roaring
and
hissing
and
jangling
had
been
about
his
ears
shut
up
in
the
dark
he
began
to
remember
all
the
tales
that
had
been
told
in
yule
round
the
fire
at
his
good
house
at
dorf
of
gnomes
and
elves
and
subterranean
terrors
and
the
erl
king
riding
on
the
black
horse
of
night
he
began
to
sob
and
to
tremble
again
and
this
time
did
scream
outright
but
the
steam
was
screaming
itself
so
loudly
that
no
one
had
there
been
any
one
nigh
would
have
heard
him
and
in
another
minute
or
so
the
train
stopped
with
a
jar
and
a
jerk
and
he
in
his
cage
could
hear
men
crying
aloud
münchen
then
he
knew
enough
of
geography
to
know
that
he
was
in
the
heart
of
bavaria
he
had
had
an
uncle
killed
in
the
bayerischenwald
by
the
bavarian
forest
guards
when
in
the
excitement
of
hunting
a
black
bear
he
had
overpassed
the
limits
of
the
tyrol
frontier
that
fate
of
his
kinsman
a
gallant
young
who
had
taught
him
to
handle
a
trigger
and
load
a
muzzle
made
the
very
name
of
bavaria
a
terror
to
august
is
bavaria
it
is
bavaria
he
sobbed
to
the
stove
but
the
stove
said
nothing
to
him
it
had
no
fire
in
it
a
stove
can
no
more
speak
without
fire
than
a
man
can
see
without
light
give
it
fire
and
it
will
sing
to
you
tell
tales
to
you
offer
you
in
return
all
the
sympathy
you
ask
is
bavaria
sobbed
august
for
it
is
always
a
name
of
dread
augury
to
the
tyroleans
by
reason
of
those
bitter
struggles
and
midnight
shots
and
untimely
deaths
which
come
from
those
meetings
of
jäger
and
hunter
in
the
bayerischenwald
but
the
train
stopped
munich
was
reached
and
august
hot
and
cold
by
turns
and
shaking
like
a
little
felt
himself
once
more
carried
out
on
the
shoulders
of
men
rolled
along
on
a
truck
and
finally
set
down
where
he
knew
not
only
he
knew
he
was
thirsty
thirsty
if
only
he
could
have
reached
his
hand
out
and
scooped
up
a
little
snow
illustration
august
opened
the
window
crammed
the
snow
into
his
mouth
again
and
again
he
thought
he
had
been
moved
on
this
truck
many
miles
but
in
truth
the
stove
had
been
only
taken
from
the
to
a
shop
in
the
marienplatz
fortunately
the
stove
was
always
set
upright
on
its
four
gilded
feet
an
injunction
to
that
effect
having
been
affixed
to
its
written
label
and
on
its
gilded
feet
it
stood
now
in
the
small
dark
of
one
hans
rhilfer
shall
not
unpack
it
till
anton
comes
he
heard
a
voice
say
and
then
he
heard
a
key
grate
in
a
lock
and
by
the
unbroken
stillness
that
ensued
he
concluded
he
was
alone
and
ventured
to
peep
through
the
straw
and
hay
what
he
saw
was
a
small
square
room
filled
with
pots
and
pans
pictures
carvings
old
blue
jugs
old
steel
armor
shields
daggers
chinese
idols
vienna
china
turkish
rugs
and
all
the
art
lumber
and
fabricated
rubbish
of
a
it
seemed
a
wonderful
place
to
him
but
oh
was
there
one
drop
of
water
in
it
all
that
was
his
single
thought
for
his
tongue
was
parching
and
his
throat
felt
on
fire
and
his
chest
began
to
be
dry
and
choked
as
with
dust
there
was
not
a
drop
of
water
but
there
was
a
lattice
window
grated
and
beyond
the
window
was
a
wide
stone
ledge
covered
with
snow
august
cast
one
look
at
the
locked
door
darted
out
of
his
ran
and
opened
the
window
crammed
the
snow
into
his
mouth
again
and
again
and
then
flew
back
into
the
stove
drew
the
hay
and
straw
over
the
place
he
entered
by
tied
the
cords
and
shut
the
brass
door
down
on
himself
he
had
brought
some
big
icicles
in
with
him
and
by
them
his
thirst
was
finally
if
only
temporarily
quenched
then
he
sat
still
in
the
bottom
of
the
stove
listening
intently
wide
awake
and
once
more
recovering
his
natural
boldness
the
thought
of
dorothea
kept
nipping
his
heart
and
his
conscience
with
a
hard
squeeze
now
and
then
but
he
thought
to
himself
i
can
take
her
back
hirschvogel
then
how
pleased
she
will
be
and
how
little
will
clap
her
hands
he
was
not
at
all
selfish
in
his
love
for
hirschvogel
he
wanted
it
for
them
all
at
home
quite
as
much
as
for
himself
there
was
at
the
bottom
of
his
mind
a
kind
of
ache
of
shame
that
his
own
have
stripped
their
hearth
and
sold
their
honor
thus
a
robin
had
been
perched
upon
a
stone
griffin
sculptured
on
a
near
august
had
felt
for
the
crumbs
of
his
loaf
in
his
pocket
and
had
thrown
them
to
the
little
bird
sitting
so
easily
on
the
frozen
snow
in
the
darkness
where
he
was
he
now
heard
a
little
song
made
faint
by
the
and
the
that
was
between
him
and
it
but
still
distinct
and
exquisitely
sweet
it
was
the
robin
singing
after
feeding
on
the
crumbs
august
as
he
heard
burst
into
tears
he
thought
of
dorothea
who
every
morning
threw
out
some
grain
or
some
bread
on
the
snow
before
the
church
use
is
it
going
she
said
we
forget
the
sweetest
creatures
god
has
made
poor
dorothea
poor
good
tender
little
soul
he
thought
of
her
till
his
tears
ran
like
rain
yet
it
never
once
occurred
to
him
to
dream
of
going
home
hirschvogel
was
here
presently
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
of
the
door
he
heard
heavy
footsteps
and
the
voice
of
the
man
who
had
said
to
his
father
have
a
little
mad
dog
muzzle
him
the
voice
said
ay
you
have
called
me
a
fool
many
times
now
you
shall
see
what
i
have
gotten
for
two
hundred
dirty
florins
never
did
do
such
a
stroke
of
then
the
other
voice
grumbled
and
swore
and
the
steps
of
the
two
men
approached
more
closely
and
the
heart
of
the
child
went
as
a
does
when
it
is
on
the
top
of
a
cheese
and
hears
a
broom
sweeping
near
they
began
to
strip
the
stove
of
its
wrappings
that
he
could
tell
by
the
noise
they
made
with
the
hay
and
the
straw
soon
they
had
stripped
it
wholly
that
too
he
knew
by
the
oaths
and
exclamations
of
wonder
and
surprise
and
rapture
which
broke
from
the
man
who
had
not
seen
it
before
right
royal
thing
a
wonderful
and
thing
grander
than
the
great
stove
of
sublime
magnificent
matchless
so
the
epithets
ran
on
in
thick
guttural
voices
diffusing
a
smell
of
so
strong
as
they
spoke
that
it
reached
august
crouching
in
his
stronghold
if
they
should
open
the
door
of
the
stove
that
was
his
frantic
fear
if
they
should
open
it
it
would
be
all
over
with
him
they
would
drag
him
out
most
likely
they
would
kill
him
he
thought
as
his
young
brother
had
been
killed
in
the
wald
the
perspiration
rolled
off
his
forehead
in
his
agony
but
he
had
control
enough
over
himself
to
keep
quiet
and
after
standing
by
the
nürnberg
work
for
nigh
an
hour
praising
marvelling
expatiating
in
the
lengthy
german
tongue
the
men
moved
to
a
little
distance
and
began
talking
of
sums
of
money
and
divided
profits
of
which
discourse
he
could
make
out
no
meaning
all
he
could
make
out
was
that
the
name
of
the
king
came
over
very
often
in
their
arguments
he
fancied
at
times
they
quarrelled
for
they
swore
lustily
and
their
voices
rose
hoarse
and
high
but
after
a
while
they
seemed
to
pacify
each
other
and
agree
to
something
and
were
in
great
glee
and
so
in
these
merry
spirits
came
and
slapped
the
luminous
sides
of
stately
hirschvogel
and
shouted
to
it
mumchance
you
have
brought
us
rare
good
luck
to
think
you
were
smoking
in
a
silly
fool
of
a
kitchen
all
these
years
then
inside
the
stove
august
jumped
up
with
flaming
cheeks
and
clinching
hands
and
was
almost
on
the
point
of
shouting
out
to
them
that
they
were
the
thieves
and
should
say
no
evil
of
his
father
when
he
remembered
just
in
time
that
to
breathe
a
word
or
make
a
sound
was
to
bring
ruin
on
himself
and
sever
him
forever
from
hirschvogel
so
he
kept
quite
still
and
the
men
barred
the
shutters
of
the
little
lattice
and
went
out
by
the
door
it
after
them
he
had
made
out
from
their
talk
that
they
were
going
to
show
hirschvogel
to
some
great
person
therefore
he
kept
quite
still
and
dared
not
move
muffled
sounds
came
to
him
through
the
shutters
from
the
streets
below
rolling
of
wheels
the
clanging
of
and
bursts
of
that
military
music
which
is
so
seldom
silent
in
the
streets
of
munich
an
hour
perhaps
passed
by
sounds
of
steps
on
the
stairs
kept
him
in
perpetual
apprehension
in
the
intensity
of
his
anxiety
he
forgot
that
he
was
hungry
and
many
miles
away
from
cheerful
old
world
little
hall
lying
by
the
clear
gray
with
the
ramparts
of
the
mountains
all
around
presently
the
door
opened
again
sharply
he
could
hear
the
two
voices
murmuring
unctuous
words
in
which
and
many
fine
long
noble
titles
played
the
chief
parts
the
voice
of
another
person
more
clear
and
refined
than
theirs
answered
them
curtly
and
then
close
by
the
nürnberg
stove
and
the
ear
ejaculated
a
single
august
almost
lost
his
terror
for
himself
in
his
thrill
of
pride
at
his
beloved
hirschvogel
being
thus
admired
in
the
great
city
he
thought
the
must
be
glad
too
ejaculated
the
stranger
a
second
time
and
then
examined
the
stove
in
all
its
parts
read
all
its
mottoes
gazed
long
on
all
its
devices
must
have
been
made
for
the
emperor
maximilian
he
said
at
last
and
the
poor
little
boy
meanwhile
within
was
up
into
nothing
as
you
children
say
dreading
that
every
moment
he
would
open
the
stove
and
open
it
truly
he
did
and
examined
the
of
the
door
but
inside
it
was
so
dark
that
crouching
august
passed
unnoticed
screwed
up
into
a
ball
like
a
hedgehog
as
he
was
the
gentleman
shut
to
the
door
at
length
without
having
seen
anything
strange
inside
it
and
then
he
talked
long
and
low
with
the
tradesmen
and
as
his
accent
was
different
from
that
which
august
was
used
to
the
child
could
distinguish
little
that
he
said
except
the
name
of
the
king
and
the
word
again
and
again
after
a
while
he
went
away
one
of
the
dealers
accompanying
him
one
of
them
lingering
behind
to
bar
up
the
shutters
then
this
one
also
withdrew
again
the
door
the
poor
little
hedgehog
uncurled
itself
and
dared
to
breathe
aloud
what
time
was
it
late
in
the
day
he
thought
for
to
accompany
the
stranger
they
had
lighted
a
lamp
he
had
heard
the
scratch
of
the
match
and
through
the
brass
had
seen
the
lines
of
light
he
would
have
to
pass
the
night
here
that
was
certain
he
and
hirschvogel
were
locked
in
but
at
least
they
were
together
if
only
he
could
have
had
something
to
eat
he
thought
with
a
pang
of
how
at
this
hour
at
home
they
ate
the
sweet
soup
sometimes
with
apples
in
it
from
aunt
farm
orchard
and
sang
together
and
listened
to
reading
of
little
tales
and
basked
in
the
glow
and
delight
that
had
beamed
on
them
from
the
great
nürnberg
poor
poor
little
what
is
she
doing
without
the
dear
hirschvogel
he
thought
poor
little
she
had
only
now
the
black
iron
stove
of
the
ugly
little
kitchen
oh
how
cruel
of
father
august
could
not
bear
to
hear
the
dealers
blame
or
laugh
at
his
father
but
he
did
feel
that
it
had
been
so
so
cruel
to
sell
hirschvogel
the
mere
memory
of
all
those
long
winter
evenings
when
they
had
all
closed
round
it
and
roasted
chestnuts
or
in
it
and
listened
to
the
howling
of
the
wind
and
the
deep
sound
of
the
and
tried
very
much
to
make
each
other
believe
that
the
wolves
still
came
down
from
the
mountains
into
the
streets
of
hall
and
were
that
very
minute
growling
at
the
house
door
this
memory
coming
on
him
with
the
sound
of
the
city
bells
and
the
knowledge
that
night
drew
near
upon
him
so
completely
being
added
to
his
hunger
and
his
fear
so
overcame
him
that
he
burst
out
crying
for
the
fiftieth
time
since
he
had
been
inside
the
stove
and
felt
that
he
would
starve
to
death
and
wondered
dreamily
if
hirschvogel
would
care
yes
he
was
sure
hirschvogel
would
care
had
he
not
decked
it
all
summer
long
with
alpine
roses
and
edelweiss
and
heaths
and
made
it
sweet
with
thyme
and
honeysuckle
and
great
had
he
ever
forgotten
when
santa
claus
came
to
make
it
its
crown
of
holly
and
ivy
and
wreathe
it
all
around
shelter
me
save
me
take
care
of
me
he
prayed
to
the
old
and
forgot
poor
little
man
that
he
had
come
on
this
chase
northward
to
save
and
take
care
of
hirschvogel
after
a
time
he
dropped
asleep
as
children
can
do
when
they
weep
and
little
robust
boys
most
surely
do
be
they
where
they
may
it
was
not
very
cold
in
this
it
was
tightly
shut
up
and
very
full
of
things
and
at
the
back
of
it
were
the
hot
pipes
of
an
adjacent
house
where
a
great
deal
of
fuel
was
burnt
moreover
clothes
were
warm
ones
and
his
blood
was
young
so
he
was
not
cold
though
munich
is
terribly
cold
in
the
nights
of
december
and
he
slept
on
and
on
was
a
comfort
to
him
for
he
forgot
his
woes
and
his
perils
and
his
hunger
for
a
time
midnight
was
once
more
chiming
from
all
the
brazen
tongues
of
the
city
when
he
awoke
and
all
being
still
around
him
ventured
to
put
his
head
out
of
the
brass
door
of
the
stove
to
see
why
such
a
strange
bright
light
was
round
him
it
was
a
very
strange
and
brilliant
light
indeed
and
yet
what
is
perhaps
still
stranger
it
did
not
frighten
or
amaze
him
nor
did
what
he
saw
alarm
him
either
and
yet
i
think
it
would
have
done
you
or
me
for
what
he
saw
was
nothing
less
than
all
the
in
motion
a
big
jug
an
of
kruessen
was
solemnly
dancing
a
minuet
with
a
plump
faenza
jar
a
tall
dutch
clock
was
going
through
a
gavotte
with
a
ancient
chair
a
very
droll
porcelain
figure
of
littenhausen
was
bowing
to
a
very
stiff
soldier
in
of
ulm
an
old
violin
of
cremona
was
playing
itself
and
a
queer
little
shrill
plaintive
music
that
thought
itself
merry
came
from
a
painted
spinnet
covered
with
faded
roses
some
gilt
spanish
leather
had
got
up
on
the
wall
and
laughed
a
dresden
mirror
was
tripping
about
crowned
with
flowers
and
a
japanese
bonze
was
riding
along
on
a
griffin
a
slim
venetian
rapier
had
come
to
blows
with
a
stout
ferrara
sabre
all
about
a
little
chit
of
a
damsel
in
white
nymphenburg
china
and
a
portly
franconian
pitcher
in
was
calling
aloud
these
italians
always
at
feud
but
nobody
listened
to
him
at
all
a
great
number
of
little
dresden
cups
and
saucers
were
all
skipping
and
waltzing
the
teapots
with
their
broad
round
faces
were
spinning
their
own
lids
like
teetotums
the
gilded
chairs
were
having
a
game
of
cards
together
and
a
little
saxe
poodle
with
a
blue
ribbon
at
its
throat
was
running
from
one
to
another
whilst
a
yellow
cat
of
cornelis
rode
about
on
a
delft
horse
in
blue
pottery
of
meanwhile
the
brilliant
light
shed
on
the
scene
came
from
three
silver
candelabra
though
they
had
no
candles
set
up
in
them
and
what
is
the
greatest
miracle
of
all
august
looked
on
at
these
mad
freaks
and
felt
no
sensation
of
wonder
he
only
as
he
heard
the
violin
and
the
spinnet
playing
felt
an
irresistible
desire
to
dance
too
no
doubt
his
face
said
what
he
wished
for
a
lovely
little
lady
all
in
pink
and
gold
and
white
with
powdered
hair
and
shoes
and
all
made
of
the
very
finest
and
fairest
meissen
china
tripped
up
to
him
and
smiled
and
gave
him
her
hand
and
led
him
out
to
a
minuet
and
he
danced
it
perfectly
little
august
in
his
thick
clumsy
shoes
and
his
thick
clumsy
sheepskin
jacket
and
his
rough
linen
and
his
broad
tyrolean
hat
he
must
have
danced
it
perfectly
this
dance
of
kings
and
queens
in
days
when
crowns
were
duly
honored
for
the
lovely
lady
always
smiled
benignly
and
never
scolded
him
at
all
and
danced
so
divinely
herself
to
the
stately
measures
the
spinnet
was
playing
that
august
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
her
till
their
minuet
ended
she
sat
down
on
her
own
bracket
am
the
princess
of
she
said
to
him
with
a
benignant
smile
you
have
got
through
that
minuet
very
then
he
ventured
to
say
to
her
my
princess
could
you
tell
me
kindly
why
some
of
the
figures
and
furniture
dance
and
speak
and
some
lie
up
in
a
corner
like
lumber
it
does
make
me
curious
is
it
rude
to
ask
for
it
greatly
puzzled
him
why
when
some
of
the
was
all
full
of
life
and
motion
some
was
quite
still
and
had
not
a
single
thrill
in
it
dear
child
said
the
powdered
lady
it
possible
that
you
do
not
know
the
reason
why
those
silent
dull
things
are
this
she
said
with
so
much
decision
that
she
evidently
considered
it
a
condensed
but
complete
answer
repeated
august
timidly
not
understanding
course
lies
falsehoods
fabrications
said
the
princess
in
pink
shoes
very
vivaciously
only
to
be
what
we
they
never
wake
up
how
can
they
no
imitation
ever
had
any
soul
in
it
said
august
humbly
not
even
sure
that
he
understood
entirely
yet
he
looked
at
hirschvogel
surely
it
had
a
royal
soul
within
it
would
it
not
wake
up
and
speak
oh
dear
how
he
longed
to
hear
the
voice
of
his
and
he
began
to
forget
that
he
stood
by
a
lady
who
sat
upon
a
pedestal
of
china
with
the
year
cut
on
it
and
the
meissen
mark
will
you
be
when
you
are
a
man
said
the
little
lady
sharply
for
her
black
eyes
were
quick
though
her
red
lips
were
smiling
you
work
for
the
like
my
great
dead
kandler
have
never
thought
said
august
stammering
do
do
hope
to
be
a
painter
as
was
master
augustin
hirschvogel
at
said
all
the
real
in
one
breath
and
the
two
italian
rapiers
left
off
fighting
to
cry
for
there
is
not
a
bit
of
true
in
all
europe
that
does
not
know
the
names
of
the
mighty
masters
august
felt
quite
pleased
to
have
won
so
much
applause
and
grew
as
red
as
the
shoes
with
bashful
contentment
knew
all
the
hirschvögel
from
old
veit
downwards
said
a
fat
de
myself
was
made
at
and
he
bowed
to
the
great
stove
very
politely
taking
off
his
own
silver
mean
a
courtly
sweep
that
he
could
scarcely
have
learned
from
burgomasters
the
stove
however
was
silent
and
a
sickening
suspicion
for
what
is
such
as
a
suspicion
of
what
we
love
came
through
the
mind
of
august
hirschvogel
only
imitation
no
no
no
he
said
to
himself
stoutly
though
hirschvogel
never
stirred
never
spoke
yet
would
he
keep
all
faith
in
it
after
all
their
happy
years
together
after
all
the
nights
of
warmth
and
joy
he
owed
it
should
he
doubt
his
own
friend
and
hero
whose
gilt
feet
he
had
kissed
in
his
babyhood
no
no
no
he
said
again
with
so
much
emphasis
that
the
lady
of
meissen
looked
sharply
again
at
him
she
said
with
pretty
disdain
believe
me
they
may
forever
they
can
never
look
like
us
they
imitate
even
our
marks
but
never
can
they
look
like
the
real
thing
never
can
they
de
should
they
said
a
bronze
statuette
of
daub
themselves
green
with
verdigris
or
sit
out
in
the
rain
to
get
rusted
but
green
and
rust
are
not
only
the
ages
can
give
that
imitations
are
all
in
primary
colors
staring
colors
hot
as
the
colors
of
a
said
the
lady
of
meissen
with
a
shiver
there
is
a
de
over
there
who
pretends
to
be
a
hans
kraut
as
i
am
said
the
jug
with
the
silver
hat
pointing
with
his
handle
to
a
jug
that
lay
prone
on
its
side
in
a
corner
has
copied
me
as
exactly
as
it
is
given
to
moderns
to
copy
us
almost
he
might
be
mistaken
for
me
but
yet
what
a
difference
there
is
how
crude
are
his
blues
how
evidently
done
over
the
glaze
are
his
black
letters
he
has
tried
to
give
himself
my
very
twist
but
what
a
lamentable
exaggeration
of
that
playful
deviation
in
my
lines
which
in
his
becomes
actual
deformity
look
at
that
said
the
gilt
cordovan
leather
with
a
contemptuous
glance
at
a
broad
piece
of
gilded
leather
spread
out
on
a
table
will
sell
him
cheek
by
jowl
with
me
and
give
him
my
name
but
look
am
overlaid
with
pure
gold
beaten
thin
as
a
film
and
laid
on
me
in
absolute
honesty
by
worthy
diego

reign
of

gold
to
eleven
other
parts
of
brass
and
rubbish
and
it
has
been
laid
on
him
with
a
brush
of
course
he
will
be
as
black
as
a
crock
in
a
few
time
whilst
i
am
as
bright
as
when
i
first
was
made
and
unless
i
am

my
cordova
burnt
its
heretics
i
shall
shine
on

because
it
is
so
soft
and
dye
it
brown
and
call
it
said
an
old
oak
cabinet
with
a
chuckle
is
not
so
painful
it
does
not
vulgarize
you
so
much
as
the
cups
they
paint
and
christen
after
said
a
carl
theodor
cup
subdued
in
hue
yet
gorgeous
as
a

can
be
so
annoying
as
to

the
princess
in
the
pink
shoes

steal
my
motto
though
it
is
scripture
said
a
of
regensburg
in
my
own
dots
they
put
on
plain
english
china
creatures
sighed
the
little
white
maid
of
nymphenburg
they
sell
hundreds
and
thousands
of
common
china
plates
calling
them
after
me
and
baking
my
saints
and
my
legends
in
a
muffle
of
it
is
blasphemy
said
a
stout
plate
of
gubbio
which
in
its
year
of
birth
had
seen
the
face
of
maestro
giorgio
is
what
is
so
terrible
in
these
places
said
the
princess
of
meissen
brings
one
in
contact
with
such
low
imitative
creatures
one
really
is
safe
nowhere
nowadays
unless
under
glass
at
the
louvre
or
south
they
get
even
there
sighed
the
de
terrible
thing
happened
to
a
dear
friend
of
mine
a
of
blasius
you
know
the
of
blasius
date
from
well
he
was
put
under
glass
in
a
museum
that
shall
be
nameless
and
he
found
himself
set
next
to
his
own
imitation
born
and
baked
yesterday
at
frankfort
and
what
think
you
the
miserable
creature
said
to
him
with
a
grin
is
what
he
called
my
friend
fellow
that
bought
got
just
as
much
commission
on
me
as
the
fellow
that
bought
and
that
was
all
that
thought
about
you
know
it
is
only
the
public
money
that
goes
and
the
horrid
creature
grinned
again
till
he
actually
cracked
himself
there
is
a
providence
above
all
things
even
might
have
interfered
before
and
saved
the
public
money
said
the
little
meissen
lady
with
the
pink
shoes
all
does
it
matter
said
a
dutch
jar
of
haarlem
the
shamming
in
the
world
will
not
them
us
does
not
like
to
be
vulgarized
said
the
lady
of
meissen
angrily
maker
the
krabbetje
a
did
not
trouble
his
head
about
that
said
the
haarlem
jar
proudly
krabbetje
made
me
for
the
kitchen
the
bright
clean
dutch
kitchen
wellnigh
three
centuries
ago
and
now
i
am
thought
worthy
the
palace
yet
i
wish
i
were
at
home
yes
i
wish
i
could
see
the
good
dutch
vrouw
and
the
shining
canals
and
the
great
green
meadows
dotted
with
the
if
we
could
all
go
back
to
our
makers
sighed
the
gubbio
plate
thinking
of
giorgio
andreoli
and
the
glad
and
gracious
days
of
the
renaissance
and
somehow
the
words
touched
the
frolicsome
souls
of
the
dancing
jars
the
spinning
teapots
the
chairs
that
were
playing
cards
and
the
violin
stopped
its
merry
music
with
a
sob
and
the
spinnet
sighed
of
dead
hands
even
the
little
saxe
poodle
howled
for
a
master
forever
lost
and
only
the
swords
went
on
quarrelling
and
made
such
a
clattering
noise
that
the
japanese
bonze
rode
at
them
on
his
monster
and
knocked
them
both
right
over
and
they
lay
straight
and
still
looking
foolish
and
the
little
nymphenburg
maid
though
she
was
crying
smiled
and
almost
laughed
then
from
where
the
great
stove
stood
there
came
a
solemn
voice
all
eyes
turned
upon
hirschvogel
and
the
heart
of
its
little
human
comrade
gave
a
great
jump
of
joy
friends
said
that
clear
voice
from
the
turret
of
nürnberg
faïence
have
listened
to
all
you
have
said
there
is
too
much
talking
among
the
mortalities
whom
one
of
themselves
has
called
the
windbags
let
not
us
be
like
them
i
hear
among
men
so
much
vain
speech
so
much
precious
breath
and
precious
time
wasted
in
empty
boasts
foolish
anger
useless
reiteration
blatant
argument
ignoble
mouthings
that
i
have
learned
to
deem
speech
a
curse
laid
on
man
to
weaken
and
envenom
all
his
undertakings
for
over
two
hundred
years
i
have
never
spoken
myself
you
i
hear
are
not
so
reticent
i
only
speak
now
because
one
of
you
said
a
beautiful
thing
that
touched
me
if
we
all
might
but
go
back
to
our
makers
ah
yes
if
we
might
we
were
made
in
days
when
even
men
were
true
creatures
and
so
we
the
work
of
their
hands
were
true
too
we
the
begotten
of
ancient
days
derive
all
the
value
in
us
from
the
fact
that
our
makers
wrought
at
us
with
zeal
with
piety
with
integrity
with
faith
to
win
fortunes
or
to
glut
a
market
but
to
do
nobly
an
honest
thing
and
create
for
the
honor
of
the
arts
and
god
i
see
amidst
you
a
little
human
thing
who
loves
me
and
in
his
own
ignorant
childish
way
loves
art
now
i
want
him
forever
to
remember
this
night
and
these
words
to
remember
that
we
are
what
we
are
and
precious
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
because
centuries
ago
those
who
were
of
single
mind
and
of
pure
hand
so
created
us
scorning
sham
and
haste
and
counterfeit
well
do
i
recollect
my
master
augustin
hirschvogel
he
led
a
wise
and
blameless
life
and
wrought
in
loyalty
and
love
and
made
his
time
beautiful
thereby
like
one
of
his
own
rich
church
casements
that
told
holy
tales
as
the
sun
streamed
through
them
ah
yes
my
friends
to
go
back
to
our
masters
would
be
the
best
that
could
befall
us
but
they
are
gone
and
even
the
perishable
labors
of
their
lives
outlive
them
for
many
many
years
i
once
honored
of
emperors
dwelt
in
a
humble
house
and
warmed
in
successive
winters
three
generations
of
little
cold
hungry
children
when
i
warmed
them
they
forgot
that
they
were
hungry
they
laughed
and
told
tales
and
slept
at
last
about
my
feet
then
i
knew
that
humble
as
had
become
my
lot
it
was
one
that
my
master
would
have
wished
for
me
and
i
was
content
sometimes
a
tired
woman
would
creep
up
to
me
and
smile
because
she
was
near
me
and
point
out
my
golden
crown
or
my
ruddy
fruit
to
a
baby
in
her
arms
that
was
better
than
to
stand
in
a
great
hall
of
a
great
city
cold
and
empty
even
though
wise
men
came
to
gaze
and
throngs
of
fools
gaped
passing
with
flattering
words
where
i
go
now
i
know
not
but
since
i
go
from
that
humble
house
where
they
loved
me
i
shall
be
sad
and
alone
they
pass
so
soon
fleeting
mortal
lives
only
we
endure
the
things
that
the
human
brain
creates
we
can
but
bless
them
a
little
as
they
glide
by
if
we
have
done
that
we
have
done
what
our
masters
wished
so
in
us
our
masters
being
dead
yet
may
speak
and
then
the
voice
sank
away
in
silence
and
a
strange
golden
light
that
had
shone
on
the
great
stove
faded
away
so
also
the
light
died
down
in
the
silver
candelabra
a
soft
pathetic
melody
stole
gently
through
the
room
it
came
from
the
old
old
spinnet
that
was
covered
with
the
faded
roses
then
that
sad
sighing
music
of
a
bygone
day
died
too
the
clocks
of
the
city
struck
six
of
the
morning
day
was
rising
over
the
bayerischenwald
august
awoke
with
a
great
start
and
found
himself
lying
on
the
bare
bricks
of
the
floor
of
the
chamber
and
all
the
was
lying
quite
still
all
around
the
pretty
lady
of
meissen
was
motionless
on
her
porcelain
bracket
and
the
little
saxe
poodle
was
quiet
at
her
side
he
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
he
was
very
cold
but
he
was
not
sensible
of
it
or
of
the
hunger
that
was
gnawing
his
little
empty
entrails
he
was
absorbed
in
the
wondrous
sight
in
the
wondrous
sounds
that
he
had
seen
and
heard
all
was
dark
around
him
was
it
still
midnight
or
had
morning
come
morning
surely
for
against
the
barred
shutters
he
heard
the
tiny
song
of
the
robin
tramp
tramp
too
came
a
heavy
step
up
the
stair
he
had
but
a
moment
in
which
to
scramble
back
into
the
interior
of
the
great
stove
when
the
door
opened
and
the
two
dealers
entered
bringing
burning
candles
with
them
to
see
their
way
august
was
scarcely
conscious
of
danger
more
than
he
was
of
cold
or
hunger
a
marvellous
sense
of
courage
of
security
of
happiness
was
about
him
like
strong
and
gentle
arms
enfolding
him
and
lifting
him
hirschvogel
would
defend
him
the
dealers
undid
the
shutters
scaring
the
away
and
then
tramped
about
in
their
heavy
boots
and
chattered
in
contented
voices
and
began
to
wrap
up
the
stove
once
more
in
all
its
straw
and
hay
and
cordage
it
never
once
occurred
to
them
to
glance
inside
why
should
they
look
inside
a
stove
that
they
had
bought
and
were
about
to
sell
again
for
all
its
glorious
beauty
of
exterior
the
child
still
did
not
feel
afraid
a
great
exaltation
had
come
to
him
he
was
like
one
lifted
up
by
his
angels
presently
the
two
traders
called
up
their
porters
and
the
stove
heedfully
swathed
and
wrapped
and
tended
as
though
it
were
some
sick
prince
going
on
a
journey
was
borne
on
the
shoulders
of
six
stout
bavarians
down
the
stairs
and
out
of
the
door
into
the
marienplatz
even
behind
all
those
wrappings
august
felt
the
icy
bite
of
the
intense
cold
of
the
outer
air
at
dawn
of
a
day
in
munich
the
men
moved
the
stove
with
exceeding
gentleness
and
care
so
that
he
had
often
been
far
more
roughly
shaken
in
his
big
arms
than
he
was
in
his
journey
now
and
though
both
hunger
and
thirst
made
themselves
felt
being
foes
that
will
take
no
denial
he
was
still
in
that
state
of
nervous
exaltation
which
deadens
all
physical
suffering
and
is
at
once
a
cordial
and
an
opiate
he
had
heard
hirschvogel
speak
that
was
enough
the
stout
carriers
tramped
through
the
city
six
of
them
with
the
nürnberg
on
their
brawny
shoulders
and
went
right
across
munich
to
the
and
august
in
the
dark
recognized
all
the
ugly
jangling
pounding
roaring
hissing
and
thought
despite
his
courage
and
excitement
it
be
a
long
journey
for
his
stomach
had
at
times
an
odd
sinking
sensation
and
his
head
sadly
often
felt
light
and
swimming
if
it
was
a
very
very
long
journey
he
felt
half
afraid
that
he
would
be
dead
or
something
bad
before
the
end
and
hirschvogel
would
be
so
lonely
that
was
what
he
thought
most
about
not
much
about
himself
and
not
much
about
dorothea
and
the
house
at
home
he
was
strung
to
high
emprise
and
could
not
look
behind
him
whether
for
a
long
or
a
short
journey
whether
for
weal
or
woe
the
stove
with
august
still
within
it
was
once
more
hoisted
up
into
a
great
van
but
this
time
it
was
not
all
alone
and
the
two
dealers
as
well
as
the
six
porters
were
all
with
it
he
in
his
darkness
knew
that
for
he
heard
their
voices
the
train
glided
away
over
the
bavarian
plain
southward
and
he
heard
the
men
say
something
of
berg
and
the
but
their
german
was
strange
to
him
and
he
could
not
make
out
what
these
names
meant
the
train
rolled
on
with
all
its
fume
and
fuss
and
roar
of
steam
and
stench
of
oil
and
burning
coal
it
had
to
go
quietly
and
slowly
on
account
of
the
snow
which
was
falling
and
which
had
fallen
all
night
might
have
waited
till
he
came
to
the
city
grumbled
one
man
to
another
weather
to
stay
on
at
berg
but
who
he
was
that
stayed
on
at
berg
august
could
not
make
out
at
all
though
the
men
grumbled
about
the
state
of
the
roads
and
the
season
they
were
hilarious
and
well
content
for
they
laughed
often
and
when
they
swore
did
so
and
promised
their
porters
fine
presents
at
and
august
like
a
shrewd
little
boy
as
he
was
who
even
in
the
secluded
innthal
had
learned
that
money
is
the
chief
mover
of
mirth
thought
to
himself
with
a
terrible
pang
have
sold
hirschvogel
for
some
great
sum
they
have
sold
him
already
then
his
heart
grew
faint
and
sick
within
him
for
he
knew
very
well
that
he
must
soon
die
shut
up
without
food
and
water
thus
and
what
new
owner
of
the
great
would
ever
permit
him
to
dwell
in
it
mind
i
die
thought
he
hirschvogel
will
know
perhaps
you
think
him
a
very
foolish
little
fellow
but
i
do
not
it
is
always
good
to
be
loyal
and
ready
to
endure
to
the
end
it
is
but
an
hour
and
a
quarter
that
the
train
usually
takes
to
pass
from
munich
to
the
or
lake
of
starnberg
but
this
morning
the
journey
was
much
slower
because
the
way
was
encumbered
by
snow
when
it
did
reach
possenhofen
and
stop
and
the
nürnberg
stove
was
lifted
out
once
more
august
could
see
through
the
of
the
brass
door
as
the
stove
stood
upright
facing
the
lake
that
this
was
a
calm
and
noble
piece
of
water
of
great
width
with
low
wooded
banks
and
distant
mountains
a
peaceful
serene
place
full
of
rest
it
was
now
near
ten
the
sun
had
come
forth
there
was
a
clear
gray
sky
hereabouts
the
snow
was
not
falling
though
it
lay
white
and
smooth
everywhere
down
to
the
edge
of
the
water
which
before
long
would
itself
be
ice
before
he
had
time
to
get
more
than
a
glimpse
of
the
green
gliding
surface
the
stove
was
again
lifted
up
and
placed
on
a
large
boat
that
was
in
waiting
of
those
very
long
and
huge
boats
which
the
women
in
these
parts
use
as
laundries
and
the
men
as
the
stove
with
much
labor
and
much
expenditure
of
time
and
care
was
hoisted
into
this
and
august
would
have
grown
sick
and
giddy
with
the
heaving
and
falling
if
his
big
brothers
had
not
long
used
him
to
such
tossing
about
so
that
he
was
as
much
at
ease
head
as
feet
downward
the
stove
once
in
it
safely
with
its
guardians
the
big
boat
moved
across
the
lake
to
leoni
how
a
little
hamlet
on
a
bavarian
lake
got
that
name
i
can
not
tell
but
leoni
it
is
the
big
boat
was
a
long
time
crossing
the
lake
here
is
about
three
miles
broad
and
these
heavy
barges
are
unwieldy
and
heavy
to
move
even
though
they
are
towed
and
tugged
at
from
the
shore
we
should
be
too
late
the
two
dealers
muttered
to
each
other
in
agitation
and
alarm
said
eleven
was
he
thought
august
buyer
of
course
of
the
slow
passage
across
the
was
accomplished
at
length
the
lake
was
placid
there
was
a
sweet
calm
in
the
air
and
on
the
water
there
was
a
great
deal
of
snow
in
the
sky
though
the
sun
was
shining
and
gave
a
solemn
hush
to
the
atmosphere
boats
and
one
little
steamer
were
going
up
and
down
in
the
clear
frosty
light
the
distant
mountains
of
zillerthal
and
the
algau
alps
were
visible
cloaked
and
furred
went
by
on
the
water
or
on
the
banks
the
deep
woods
of
the
shores
were
black
and
gray
and
brown
poor
august
could
see
nothing
of
a
scene
that
would
have
delighted
him
as
the
stove
was
now
set
he
could
only
see
the
old
worm
eaten
wood
of
the
huge
barge
presently
they
touched
the
pier
at
leoni
men
for
a
stout
mile
and
half
you
shall
drink
your
reward
at
said
one
of
the
dealers
to
his
porters
who
stout
strong
men
as
they
were
showed
a
disposition
to
grumble
at
their
task
encouraged
by
large
promises
they
shouldered
sullenly
the
nürnberg
stove
grumbling
again
at
its
preposterous
weight
but
little
dreaming
that
they
carried
within
it
a
small
panting
trembling
boy
for
august
began
to
tremble
now
that
he
was
about
to
see
the
future
owner
of
hirschvogel
he
look
a
good
kind
man
he
thought
will
beg
him
to
let
me
stay
with
the
porters
began
their
toilsome
journey
and
moved
off
from
the
village
pier
he
could
see
nothing
for
the
brass
door
was
over
his
head
and
all
that
gleamed
through
it
was
the
clear
gray
sky
he
had
been
tilted
on
to
his
back
and
if
he
had
not
been
a
little
mountaineer
used
to
hanging
over
crevasses
and
moreover
seasoned
to
rough
treatment
by
the
hunters
and
guides
of
the
hills
and
the
in
the
town
he
would
have
been
made
ill
and
sick
by
the
bruising
and
shaking
and
many
changes
of
position
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
the
way
the
men
took
was
a
mile
and
a
half
in
length
but
the
road
was
heavy
with
snow
and
the
burden
they
bore
was
heavier
still
the
dealers
cheered
them
on
swore
at
them
and
praised
them
in
one
breath
besought
them
and
reiterated
their
splendid
promises
for
a
clock
was
striking
eleven
and
they
had
been
ordered
to
reach
their
destination
at
that
hour
and
though
the
air
was
so
cold
the
rolled
off
their
foreheads
as
they
walked
they
were
so
frightened
at
being
late
but
the
porters
would
not
budge
a
foot
quicker
than
they
chose
and
as
they
were
not
poor
carriers
their
employers
dared
not
thrash
them
though
most
willingly
would
they
have
done
so
the
road
seemed
terribly
long
to
the
anxious
tradesmen
to
the
plodding
porters
to
the
poor
little
man
inside
the
stove
as
he
kept
sinking
and
rising
sinking
and
rising
with
each
of
their
steps
where
they
were
going
he
had
no
idea
only
after
a
very
long
time
he
lost
the
sense
of
the
fresh
icy
wind
blowing
on
his
face
through
the
above
and
felt
by
their
movements
beneath
him
that
they
were
mounting
steps
or
stairs
then
he
heard
a
great
many
different
voices
but
he
could
not
understand
what
was
being
said
he
felt
that
his
bearers
paused
some
time
then
moved
on
and
on
again
their
feet
went
so
softly
he
thought
they
must
be
moving
on
carpet
and
as
he
felt
a
warm
air
come
to
him
he
concluded
that
he
was
in
some
heated
chambers
for
he
was
a
clever
little
fellow
and
could
put
two
and
two
together
though
he
was
so
hungry
and
so
thirsty
and
his
empty
stomach
felt
so
strangely
they
must
have
gone
he
thought
through
some
very
great
number
of
rooms
for
they
walked
so
long
on
and
on
on
and
on
at
last
the
stove
was
set
down
again
and
happily
for
him
set
so
that
his
feet
were
downward
what
he
fancied
was
that
he
was
in
some
museum
like
that
which
he
had
seen
in
the
city
of
innspruck
the
voices
he
heard
were
very
hushed
and
the
steps
seemed
to
go
away
far
away
leaving
him
alone
with
hirschvogel
he
dared
not
look
out
but
he
peeped
through
the
and
all
he
could
see
was
a
big
carved
head
in
ivory
with
a
gold
crown
atop
it
belonged
to
a
velvet
fauteuil
but
he
could
not
see
the
chair
only
the
ivory
lion
there
was
a
delicious
fragrance
in
the
air
fragrance
as
of
flowers
how
can
it
be
flowers
thought
august
is
november
from
afar
off
as
it
seemed
there
came
a
dreamy
exquisite
music
as
sweet
as
the
had
been
but
so
much
fuller
so
much
richer
seeming
as
though
a
chorus
of
angels
were
singing
all
together
august
ceased
to
think
of
the
museum
he
thought
of
heaven
we
gone
to
the
master
he
thought
remembering
the
words
of
hirschvogel
all
was
so
still
around
him
there
was
no
sound
anywhere
except
the
sound
of
the
choral
music
he
did
not
know
it
but
he
was
in
the
royal
castle
of
berg
and
the
music
he
heard
was
the
music
of
wagner
who
was
playing
in
a
distant
room
some
of
the
motives
of
presently
he
heard
a
fresh
step
near
him
and
he
heard
a
low
voice
say
close
behind
him
an
exclamation
no
doubt
he
thought
of
admiration
and
wonder
at
the
beauty
of
hirschvogel
then
the
same
voice
said
after
a
long
pause
during
which
no
doubt
as
august
thought
this
was
examining
all
the
details
of
the
wondrous
was
well
bought
it
is
exceedingly
beautiful
it
is
most
undoubtedly
the
work
of
augustin
then
the
hand
of
the
speaker
turned
the
round
handle
of
the
brass
door
and
the
fainting
soul
of
the
poor
little
prisoner
within
grew
sick
with
fear
the
handle
turned
the
door
was
slowly
drawn
open
some
one
bent
down
and
looked
in
and
the
same
voice
that
he
had
heard
in
praise
of
its
beauty
called
aloud
in
surprise
is
this
in
it
a
live
child
then
august
terrified
beyond
all
and
dominated
by
one
sprang
out
of
the
body
of
the
stove
and
fell
at
the
feet
of
the
speaker
let
me
stay
pray
meinherr
let
me
stay
he
sobbed
have
come
all
the
way
with
hirschvogel
some
hands
seized
him
not
gently
by
any
means
and
their
lips
angrily
muttered
in
his
ear
knave
peace
be
quiet
hold
your
tongue
it
is
the
king
they
were
about
to
drag
him
out
of
the
august
atmosphere
as
if
he
had
been
some
venomous
dangerous
beast
come
there
to
slay
but
the
voice
he
had
heard
speak
of
the
stove
said
in
kind
accents
little
child
he
is
very
young
let
him
go
let
him
speak
to
the
word
of
a
king
is
law
to
his
courtiers
so
sorely
against
their
wish
the
angry
and
astonished
chamberlains
let
august
slide
out
of
their
grasp
and
he
stood
there
in
his
little
rough
sheepskin
coat
and
his
thick
boots
with
his
curling
hair
all
in
a
tangle
in
the
midst
of
the
most
beautiful
chamber
he
had
ever
dreamed
of
and
in
the
presence
of
a
young
man
with
a
beautiful
dark
face
and
eyes
full
of
dreams
and
fire
and
the
young
man
said
to
him
child
how
came
you
here
hidden
in
this
stove
be
not
afraid
tell
me
the
truth
i
am
the
august
in
an
instinct
of
homage
cast
his
great
battered
black
hat
with
the
tarnished
gold
tassels
down
on
the
floor
of
the
room
and
folded
his
little
brown
hands
in
supplication
he
was
too
intensely
in
earnest
to
be
in
any
way
abashed
he
was
too
lifted
out
of
himself
by
his
love
for
hirschvogel
to
be
conscious
of
any
awe
before
any
earthly
majesty
he
was
only
so
glad
it
was
the
king
kings
were
always
kind
so
the
tyrolese
think
who
love
their
lords
dear
king
he
said
with
trembling
entreaty
in
his
faint
little
voice
was
ours
and
we
have
loved
it
all
our
lives
and
father
sold
it
and
when
i
saw
that
it
did
really
go
from
us
then
i
said
to
myself
i
would
go
with
it
and
i
have
come
all
the
way
inside
it
and
last
night
it
spoke
and
said
beautiful
things
and
i
do
pray
you
to
let
me
live
with
it
and
i
will
go
out
every
morning
and
cut
wood
for
it
and
you
if
only
you
will
let
me
stay
beside
it
no
one
ever
has
fed
it
with
fuel
but
me
since
i
grew
big
enough
and
it
loves
me
does
indeed
it
said
so
last
night
and
it
said
that
it
had
been
happier
with
us
than
if
it
were
in
any
and
then
his
breath
failed
him
and
as
he
lifted
his
little
eager
pale
face
to
the
young
great
tears
were
falling
down
his
cheeks
now
the
king
likes
all
poetic
and
uncommon
things
and
there
was
that
in
the
face
which
pleased
and
touched
him
he
motioned
to
his
gentlemen
to
leave
the
little
boy
alone
is
your
name
he
asked
him
am
august
strehla
my
father
is
hans
strehla
we
live
in
hall
in
the
innthal
and
hirschvogel
has
been
ours
so
long
long
his
lips
quivered
with
a
broken
sob
have
you
truly
travelled
inside
this
stove
all
the
way
from
tyrol
said
august
one
thought
to
look
inside
till
you
the
king
laughed
then
another
view
of
the
matter
occurred
to
him
bought
the
stove
of
your
father
he
inquired
of
munich
said
august
who
did
not
know
that
he
ought
not
to
have
spoken
to
the
king
as
to
a
simple
citizen
and
whose
little
brain
was
whirling
and
spinning
dizzily
round
its
one
central
idea
sum
did
they
pay
your
father
do
you
know
asked
the
sovereign
hundred
florins
said
august
with
a
great
sigh
of
shame
was
so
much
money
and
he
is
so
poor
and
there
are
so
many
of
the
king
turned
to
his
these
dealers
of
munich
come
with
the
he
was
answered
in
the
affirmative
he
desired
them
to
be
sought
for
and
brought
before
him
as
one
of
his
chamberlains
hastened
on
the
errand
the
monarch
looked
at
august
with
compassion
are
very
pale
little
fellow
when
did
you
eat
last
had
some
bread
and
sausage
with
me
yesterday
afternoon
i
finished
would
like
to
eat
now
i
might
have
a
little
water
i
would
be
glad
my
throat
is
very
the
king
had
water
and
wine
brought
for
him
and
cake
also
but
august
though
he
drank
eagerly
could
not
swallow
anything
his
mind
was
in
too
great
a
tumult
i
stay
with
hirschvogel
i
stay
he
said
with
feverish
agitation
a
little
said
the
king
and
asked
abruptly
do
you
wish
to
be
when
you
are
a
man
painter
i
wish
to
be
what
hirschvogel
was
mean
the
master
that
made
my
understand
said
the
king
then
the
two
dealers
were
brought
into
their
presence
they
were
so
terribly
alarmed
not
being
either
so
innocent
or
so
ignorant
as
august
was
that
they
were
trembling
as
though
they
were
being
led
to
the
slaughter
and
they
were
so
utterly
astonished
too
at
a
child
having
come
all
the
way
from
tyrol
in
the
stove
as
a
gentleman
of
the
court
had
just
told
them
this
child
had
done
that
they
could
not
tell
what
to
say
or
where
to
look
and
presented
a
very
foolish
aspect
indeed
you
buy
this
nürnberg
stove
of
this
little
father
for
two
hundred
florins
the
king
asked
them
and
his
voice
was
no
longer
soft
and
kind
as
it
had
been
when
addressing
the
child
but
very
stern
your
majesty
murmured
the
trembling
traders
how
much
did
the
gentleman
who
purchased
it
for
me
give
to
you
thousand
ducats
your
majesty
muttered
the
dealers
frightened
out
of
their
wits
and
telling
the
truth
in
their
fright
the
gentleman
was
not
present
he
was
a
trusted
counsellor
in
art
matters
of
the
and
often
made
purchases
for
him
the
king
smiled
a
little
and
said
nothing
the
gentleman
had
made
out
the
price
to
him
as
eleven
thousand
ducats
will
give
at
once
to
this
father
the
two
thousand
gold
ducats
that
you
received
less
the
two
hundred
austrian
florins
that
you
paid
him
said
the
king
to
his
humiliated
and
abject
subjects
are
great
rogues
be
thankful
you
are
not
more
greatly
he
dismissed
them
by
a
sign
to
his
courtiers
and
to
one
of
these
gave
the
mission
of
making
the
dealers
of
the
marienplatz
disgorge
their
gains
august
heard
and
felt
dazzled
yet
miserable
two
thousand
gold
bavarian
ducats
for
his
father
why
his
father
would
never
need
to
go
any
more
to
the
and
yet
whether
for
ducats
or
for
florins
hirschvogel
was
sold
just
the
same
and
would
the
king
let
him
stay
with
it
he
do
oh
please
do
he
murmured
joining
his
little
brown
hands
and
kneeling
down
before
the
young
monarch
who
himself
stood
absorbed
in
painful
thought
for
the
deception
so
basely
practised
for
the
greedy
sake
of
gain
on
him
by
a
trusted
counsellor
was
bitter
to
him
he
looked
down
on
the
child
and
as
he
did
so
smiled
once
more
up
my
little
man
he
said
in
a
kind
voice
only
to
your
god
will
i
let
you
stay
with
your
hirschvogel
yes
i
will
you
shall
stay
at
my
court
and
you
shall
be
taught
to
be
a
painter
oils
or
on
porcelain
as
you
will
you
must
grow
up
worthily
and
win
all
the
laurels
at
our
schools
of
art
and
if
when
you
are
years
old
you
have
done
well
and
bravely
then
i
will
give
you
your
nürnberg
stove
or
if
i
am
no
more
living
then
those
who
reign
after
me
shall
do
so
and
now
go
away
with
this
gentleman
and
be
not
afraid
and
you
shall
light
a
fire
every
morning
in
hirschvogel
but
you
will
not
need
to
go
out
and
cut
the
then
he
smiled
and
stretched
out
his
hand
the
courtiers
tried
to
make
august
understand
that
he
ought
to
bow
and
touch
it
with
his
lips
but
august
could
not
understand
that
anyhow
he
was
too
happy
he
threw
his
two
arms
about
the
knees
and
kissed
his
feet
passionately
then
he
lost
all
sense
of
where
he
was
and
fainted
away
from
hunger
and
tire
and
emotion
and
wondrous
joy
as
the
darkness
of
his
swoon
closed
in
on
him
he
heard
in
his
fancy
the
voice
from
hirschvogel
saying
us
be
worthy
our
maker
he
is
only
a
scholar
yet
but
he
is
a
happy
scholar
and
promises
to
be
a
great
man
sometimes
he
goes
back
for
a
few
days
to
hall
where
the
gold
ducats
have
made
his
father
prosperous
in
the
old
there
is
a
large
white
porcelain
stove
of
munich
the
gift
to
dorothea
and
and
august
never
goes
home
without
going
into
the
great
church
and
saying
his
thanks
to
god
who
blessed
his
strange
journey
in
the
nürnberg
stove
as
for
his
dream
in
the
room
that
night
he
will
never
admit
that
he
did
dream
it
he
still
declares
that
he
saw
it
all
and
heard
the
voice
of
hirschvogel
and
who
shall
say
that
he
did
not
for
what
is
the
gift
of
the
poet
and
the
artist
except
to
see
the
sights
which
others
can
not
see
and
to
hear
the
sounds
that
others
can
not
hear
footnote
a
jan
asselyn
called
krabbetje
the
little
crab
born
of
delft
and
haarlem
in
the
it
was
in
one
of
the
green
lanes
of
south
devonshire
that
gemma
being
quite
tired
out
threw
herself
down
on
the
daisied
grass
and
said
to
her
grandfather
let
us
rest
a
little
and
her
grandfather
said
to
her
i
would
eat
gladly
but
we
have
nothing
to
eat
the
satchel
is
illustration
us
rest
a
little
and
gemma
lying
chest
downward
on
the
turf
sighed
and
buried
her
hands
in
her
abundant
curls
and
cooled
her
forehead
on
the
damp
grass
she
was
just
thirteen
years
old
and
she
was
so
pretty
that
she
made
the
heart
of
the
old
grandfather
ache
often
when
he
looked
at
her
and
thought
that
she
would
most
likely
soon
be
left
alone
in
the
world
for
her
little
brother
bindo
could
not
be
said
to
count
for
anything
being
only
ten
years
old
gemma
was
very
lovely
indeed
being
tall
and
lithe
and
gay
and
full
of
grace
and
having
a
beautiful
changeable
face
all
light
and
color
but
she
was
only
thirteen
and
all
she
could
do
to
get
her
livelihood
was
to
dance
the
and
the
she
and
her
brother
danced
which
they
did
very
prettily
and
the
old
man
whom
they
called
nonno
told
fortunes
and
performed
some
simple
conjuring
tricks
and
these
were
all
bad
trades
as
times
went
for
nowadays
nobody
amuses
himself
with
simple
things
and
the
rural
folk
have
grown
as
sharp
and
as
serious
as
the
city
people
which
to
my
thinking
is
a
very
great
loss
to
the
world
for
merry
people
are
generally
kind
people
and
contented
people
are
easily
governed
and
have
no
appetites
for
politics
and
philosophies
and
the
like
indigestible
things
nonno
and
gemma
and
bindo
were
merry
enough
even
on
empty
stomachs
the
old
man
was
as
simple
as
a
duck
and
as
gentle
as
a
rabbit
and
was
rather
more
of
a
child
than
either
of
the
children
bindo
was
a
little
round
playful
gleeful
thing
like
a
little
and
gemma
was
as
gay
as
a
lark
though
she
had
to
bear
the
burden
of
the
only
brains
that
there
were
in
the
family
they
were
little
neapolitans
they
had
been
born
in
a
little
cabin
on
the
sunny
shore
facing
ischia
and
in
their
infancy
had
tumbled
about
naked
and
glad
as
young
dolphins
in
the
bright
blue
waters
then
their
parents
had
died
father
at
sea
their
mother
of
fever
left
them
to
the
care
of
nonno
nonno
who
was
very
old
so
old
that
they
thought
he
must
have
been
made
almost
before
the
world
itself
and
who
after
having
been
a
showman
of
puppets
to
divert
the
poorest
classes
all
his
life
was
so
very
poor
himself
then
that
he
could
hardly
scrape
enough
together
to
get
a
little
drink
of
thin
wine
and
an
inch
or
two
of
polenta
being
so
very
poor
he
was
seduced
into
accepting
an
engagement
for
himself
and
the
children
with
a
wicked
man
whose
business
it
was
in
life
to
decoy
poor
little
italians
and
make
money
out
of
them
in
foreign
lands
nonno
was
so
good
and
simple
himself
that
he
thought
everybody
was
as
harmless
as
he
was
and
his
grief
and
amazement
were
very
great
when
on
reaching
the
english
shores
with
this
wicked
man
he
found
that
the
wicked
man
meant
to
give
him
the
slip
altogether
and
go
off
with
the
two
children
by
a
mere
hazard
nonno
whose
name
was
epifania
santo
a
droll
name
but
he
himself
had
been
a
foundling
was
able
to
defeat
the
wicked
man
so
far
that
he
got
out
of
his
clutches
and
took
his
grandchildren
with
him
but
there
they
all
three
were
in
england
with
no
money
at
all
and
nothing
on
earth
but
a
few
puppets
and
a
box
of
playthings
and
the
stilts
on
which
the
wicked
man
had
had
the
children
taught
to
walk
and
in
england
they
had
now
been
four
years
remaining
there
chiefly
because
they
had
no
notion
how
to
get
home
again
and
partly
because
nonno
had
such
a
great
terror
of
the
sea
he
had
suffered
so
much
on
the
long
voyage
into
which
he
had
been
entrapped
from
naples
round
by
the
bay
of
biscay
up
the
bristol
channel
that
he
would
sooner
have
died
there
and
then
than
have
set
foot
again
on
board
a
vessel
so
in
england
they
had
stayed
wandering
about
and
picking
up
a
few
pence
in
villages
and
towns
and
clinging
together
tenderly
and
being
very
often
hungry
cold
tired
roofless
but
yet
being
all
the
while
happy
sometimes
too
they
fared
well
the
brilliant
uncommon
beauty
and
pretty
foreign
accent
often
touched
hearts
and
sometimes
they
would
get
bed
and
board
at
homely
high
on
lonely
hills
or
be
made
welcome
without
payment
in
little
wayside
inns
they
had
kept
to
the
southwest
part
of
the
kingdom
never
being
able
to
afford
other
means
of
locomotion
than
their
own
feet
and
the
farthest
distance
they
had
ever
compassed
had
been
this
where
the
green
woods
and
pastures
roll
down
to
the
broad
estuaries
of
exe
and
dart
this
green
wet
shadowy
country
always
seemed
strange
to
the
children
for
a
long
while
they
thought
it
was
always
evening
in
england
they
could
remember
the
long
sunshiny
years
at
home
and
the
radiant
air
and
the
blue
clear
sky
and
the
sea
that
seemed
always
laughing
they
could
never
forget
it
indeed
and
when
they
were
together
they
never
talked
of
anything
else
only
the
and
the
green
and
black
figs
the
red
tomatoes
and
the
rough
pomegranates
and
the
big
balls
of
gold
to
be
had
in
the
orange
woods
just
for
the
plucking
the
boats
with
the
pretty
striped
sails
and
the
villas
with
the
marbles
and
the
palms
and
the
islands
all
aglow
in
the
sunset
and
the
distance
you
could
see
looking
away
away
away
into
the
immeasurable
azure
of
the
air
oh
yes
they
remembered
it
all
and
at
night
they
would
weep
for
it
the
old
slow
salt
tears
mingling
with
the
passionate
rain
of
the
childish
eyes
here
it
was
green
and
pretty
in
its
own
way
but
all
so
dark
so
wet
so
misty
i
try
to
see
there
is
a
white
wall
of
shadow
think
it
is
shadow
perhaps
it
is
fog
but
it
is
always
there
said
gemma
home
one
looks
and
looks
and
looks
there
is
no
end
to
gemma
longed
sorely
to
go
home
she
had
not
minded
the
sea
at
all
bindo
like
nonno
had
been
very
ill
on
the
voyage
and
cried
even
now
whenever
he
saw
a
ship
for
fear
he
should
be
going
in
it
bindo
was
sadly
babyish
for
ten
years
old
to
make
amends
his
sister
was
almost
a
woman
at
thirteen
they
ought
now
to
have
been
all
three
serious
and
alarmed
for
satchel
had
not
a
penny
in
it
nor
a
crust
and
they
were
all
hungry
for
it
was
noonday
but
instead
of
being
miserable
they
joked
and
laughed
and
kissed
each
other
as
thousands
of
their
at
home
with
equally
empty
stomachs
were
doing
lying
on
sunny
moles
or
benches
or
thymy
turf
under
ilex
shadows
but
then
in
our
dear
italy
there
is
always
the
sun
the
light
the
air
that
kisses
and
feeds
and
sends
to
soft
sleep
her
children
and
gemma
and
her
brother
and
grandfather
were
in
a
wet
english
lane
with
the
clouds
hurrying
up
over
the
distant
hills
by
dartmoor
and
the
raindrops
still
hanging
to
the
great
overhead
yet
they
were
merry
and
sang
snatches
of
neapolitan
songs
and
took
no
thought
for
the
morrow
they
were
not
far
off
dartmouth
and
they
meant
to
go
into
the
quaint
old
town
by
and
the
dart
and
were
always
kind
to
them
if
they
were
hungry
now
they
would
eat
suddenly
however
nonno
grew
thoughtful
as
he
looked
at
gemma
lying
face
downward
on
the
wet
grass
her
sandalled
feet
in
air
a
fluttering
above
her
head
would
you
do
if
i
were
to
die
my
said
the
poor
old
man
all
at
once
remembering
he
was
nigh
eighty
years
old
gemma
raised
herself
and
said
nothing
her
eyes
which
were
very
beautiful
eyes
grew
sad
and
moist
would
take
care
of
bindo
nonno
she
answered
at
last
not
be
afraid
of
how
it
is
easy
to
say
but
how
suppose
i
could
dance
at
theatres
said
gemma
after
reflection
nonno
shook
his
head
the
theatres
you
would
need
to
dance
differently
it
is
all
spinning
craning
drilling
there
you
dance
my
child
as
a
flower
in
the
wind
the
theatres
do
not
care
for
i
do
not
know
said
gemma
something
i
would
do
bindo
should
not
are
a
good
child
said
the
old
man
tenderly
she
sank
down
again
on
the
grass
not
think
of
dying
nonno
she
said
is
all
so
dark
where
death
when
one
gets
to
the
saints
said
the
simple
old
man
he
always
fancied
paradise
just
like
amalfi
own
amalfi
where
long
ago
so
long
ago
he
had
run
and
leaped
a
merry
naked
boy
in
the
azure
waves
and
caught
the
glittering
and
the
pink
column
of
the
gemmia
in
his
hands
paradise
would
be
just
like
amalfi
the
promise
of
it
consoled
him
as
he
trotted
on
tired
limbs
along
the
wet
gravel
of
english
or
meekly
bore
the
noisy
of
english
village
crowds
the
rain
had
ceased
and
the
sun
was
shining
a
little
in
a
drowsy
way
as
if
it
were
but
half
awake
even
at
there
were
big
hedges
on
either
side
of
the
lane
and
broad
strips
of
turf
these
lanes
are
almost
all
that
is
left
of
the
rural
and
leafy
old
england
of
seventeen
hundred
and
they
are
beautiful
in
their
own
way
when
midsummer
crowds
them
with
flowers
and
in
spring
when
their
blossom
and
in
autumn
when
their
are
brown
with
nuts
and
in
winter
when
their
holly
and
ivy
clamber
high
and
their
fine
trees
make
a
tracery
of
bare
boughs
delicate
as
the
of
lace
against
the
gray
skies
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
to
their
right
there
was
a
large
it
was
now
the
time
when
wheat
is
ripe
in
england
and
the
men
and
women
who
were
reaping
it
were
sitting
resting
drinking
their
cider
and
eating
their
noonday
bread
and
bacon
bindo
watched
them
through
a
hole
in
the
hedge
and
began
to
cry
makes
me
hungrier
to
see
them
eat
he
said
with
a
sob
gemma
sprang
to
her
feet
not
cry
so
my
bindo
she
said
with
a
tender
voice
will
ask
them
to
give
you
she
thrust
her
lithe
body
through
the
gap
and
walked
boldly
across
the
field
strange
figure
for
an
english
with
her
short
white
skirt
and
her
red
bodice
and
her
striped
sash
of
many
colors
and
her
little
coral
in
her
ears
she
was
bareheaded
and
her
dusky
gold
hair
the
hair
that
the
old
painters
loved
was
coiled
all
around
her
small
head
little
brother
is
hungry
will
you
be
so
very
gentle
and
give
us
a
little
bread
she
said
in
her
pretty
accent
which
robbed
the
english
tongue
of
all
its
gutturals
and
clothed
it
in
a
sweetness
not
its
own
she
was
not
fond
of
begging
being
proud
and
she
colored
very
much
as
she
said
it
the
reapers
stared
then
grinned
gaped
once
or
twice
and
then
stretched
big
brown
hands
out
to
her
with
goodly
portions
of
food
and
one
added
a
mug
of
cider
do
thank
you
so
much
she
said
with
a
smile
that
was
like
a
sunbeam
drink
i
take
not
for
nonno
has
no
love
of
it
but
for
the
bread
i
pray
may
san
martino
bless
you
then
she
courtesied
to
them
as
nature
and
nobody
else
had
taught
her
to
do
and
ran
away
fleet
as
a
lapwing
with
her
treasure
that
of
the
popish
country
said
the
men
one
to
another
and
added
that
if
the
master
caught
her
in
his
lane
be
the
worse
for
her
for
he
couldna
abide
tramps
and
but
gemma
who
knew
nothing
of
that
was
sharing
her
spoils
with
glee
and
breaking
the
small
bit
of
bread
she
allowed
to
herself
with
teeth
as
white
as
a
way
to
dartmouth
will
not
now
seem
so
long
she
said
and
bindo
nodded
his
head
with
a
mouth
quite
full
of
good
brown
bread
and
fat
bacon
much
do
they
love
here
said
nonno
with
a
sigh
thinking
of
the
long
coils
of
macaroni
the
lovely
little
fried
fish
the
oil
the
garlic
the
black
beans
that
he
never
saw
now
alas
alas
land
is
fat
but
the
people
they
know
not
how
to
live
he
added
with
a
sigh
people
without
wine
should
they
know
make
good
bread
said
gemma
with
her
ivory
teeth
in
a
crust
meantime
the
person
who
owned
the
lane
was
coming
out
into
the
fields
to
see
how
his
men
got
on
with
their
work
his
house
stood
near
hidden
in
trees
on
a
bend
of
the
exe
he
was
rich
young
prosperous
and
handsome
he
was
also
generous
and
charitable
but
he
was
a
magistrate
and
he
hated
strollers
by
name
he
was
known
as
philip
carey
his
people
had
been
squires
here
for
many
generations
he
called
himself
a
yeoman
and
was
as
proud
as
if
he
were
a
prince
as
fates
would
have
it
he
rode
down
the
lane
now
on
his
gray
horse
and
when
he
saw
the
group
of
nonno
and
gemma
and
bindo
with
their
bags
and
bales
and
bundles
scattered
about
on
the
turf
of
his
lane
his
gray
eyes
grew
ominously
dark
gave
you
leave
to
come
here
he
asked
sternly
enough
as
he
reined
up
his
horse
nonno
looked
up
smiling
and
stood
up
and
bowed
with
grace
and
ease
the
english
tongue
he
had
never
been
able
to
master
he
glanced
at
gemma
to
bid
her
answer

only
resting

said
she
boldly

public

public

said
the
owner
of
it

have
no

repeated
gemma
she
did
not
understand
the
word

gemma

her

answered
nonno

grandfather
is
what
you
say
in
english
we
say
can
not
he
speak
english
he
has
lost
his
teeth
and
it
is
so
hard
is
your
are
an
impudent
gemma
smiled
her
beautiful
shining
smile
as
if
he
had
paid
her
an
admirable
compliment
she
knew
the
rider
by
sight
very
well
though
he
did
not
know
her
his
housekeeper
had
whipped
bindo
for
getting
into
her
and
putting
two
eggs
in
his
pocket
and
his
gardener
one
day
had
turned
them
both
out
of
his
orchards
as
trespassers
so
that
he
and
his
residence
of
honor
were
already
scored
with
black
in
the
tablets
of
the
memories
that
he
was
a
handsome
young
man
with
a
grave
and
pensive
face
and
a
very
sweet
smile
when
he
did
smile
which
was
rarely
did
not
affect
dislike
to
him
she
was
too
young
to
be
impressed
by
good
looks
philip
carey
was
not
touched
by
the
beauty
of
her
either
he
scarcely
saw
that
she
was
pretty
he
was
so
angry
with
her
for
what
seemed
to
him
her
saucy
answers
are
you
not
dressed
like
a
christian
he
said
somewhat
irrelevantly
am
a
christian
said
gemma
angry
in
her
turn
better
christian
than
you
are
and
what
is
my
dress
to
you
you
do
not
buy
is
oh
cried
gemma
with
a
lightning
in
her
eyes
and
like
lightning
she
leaped
up
on
to
the
saddle
and
gave
the
astonished
gentleman
a
sounding
box
on
both
ears
he
was
so
utterly
astonished
that
he
had
no
time
to
protect
himself
and
his
horse
which
was
utterly
astonished
too
began
to
plunge
and
rear
and
kick
and
fully
occupied
him
whilst
a
guffaw
from
the
field
beyond
added
to
his
rage
by
telling
him
that
his
reapers
had
witnessed
his
discomfiture
gemma
had
leaped
to
the
ground
as
swiftly
as
she
had
leaped
to
the
saddle
and
whilst
the
horse
was
rearing
and
plunging
had
caught
up
their
bag
and
baggage
had
pushed
and
pulled
her
brother
and
her
grandfather
before
her
and
had
flown
down
the
lane
and
out
of
sight
before
philip
carey
had
reduced
his
steed
to
any
semblance
of
reason
his
ears
tingled
and
his
pride
was
bitterly
incensed
yet
he
could
not
help
laughing
at
himself
little
tigress
he
thought
as
he
endeavored
to
soothe
his
fretting
and
wheeling
beast
which
was
young
and
only
half
broken
when
he
rode
in
at
last
by
an
open
gate
among
his
reapers
the
men
were
all
too
afraid
of
him
not
to
wear
very
grave
faces
as
though
they
had
seen
nothing
every
one
was
afraid
of
philip
carey
except
his
dogs
which
shows
that
he
had
a
good
heart
under
a
stern
manner
for
dogs
never
make
mistakes
as
men
do
he
remained
about
his
fields
all
the
day
and
went
home
to
a
solitary
dinner
he
had
no
living
relative
he
was
rather
more
of
a
scholar
than
a
farmer
and
liked
his
loneliness
his
old
house
which
was
called
honor
ever
since
the
days
of
the
tudors
was
a
rambling
comfortable
building
set
amidst
green
lawn
huge
and
and
meadows
that
stretched
downward
to
the
broad
dart
water
it
was
all
within
and
without
as
it
had
been
in
the
days
of
the
armada
and
the
ivy
that
covered
it
was
as
old
as
the
brass
dogs
in
the
big
many
men
with
such
a
possession
would
have
been
restless
to
reach
a
higher
rank
but
philip
carey
was
a
grave
young
man
of
refined
and
severe
taste
and
simple
habits
he
loved
his
home
and
was
content
with
it
and
wanted
nothing
of
the
world
this
evening
he
did
not
feel
so
contented
as
usual
his
ears
seemed
still
to
tingle
from
those
blows
at
the
hand
of
a
child
he
liked
old
greek
and
latin
authors
and
when
the
day
was
done
liked
to
sit
and
read
of
a
summer
evening
under
the
biggest
yew
upon
his
lawn
with
the
lowing
of
the
cattle
the
song
of
the
nightingale
and
the
cries
of
the
the
only
sounds
upon
the
quiet
air
but
this
evening
his
favorite
philosophers
said
nothing
to
him
had
plato
or
any
one
of
them
ever
had
his
ears
boxed
by
a
little
fury
of
a
strolling
dancer
the
little
fury
meanwhile
was
dancing
the
with
her
brother
before
a
crazy
old
wooden
inn
in
dartmouth
it
as
the
girls
do
under
the
in
sardinia
and
under
the
spreading
oaks
of
the
marches
and
so
pleasing
the
yokels
of
the
river
town
with
her
grace
and
fire
and
animation
that
the
pence
rolled
in
by
scores
into
her
tambourine
and
the
mistress
of
the
poor
little
inn
said
to
her
my
pretty
as
you
have
gained
them
here
you
must
spend
them
here
and
it
is
gemma
was
quite
happy
to
have
gained
so
much
and
she
got
a
modest
little
supper
for
nonno
and
as
she
shook
down
all
her
dark
gold
hair
in
the
moonlight
and
looked
on
the
water
rippling
away
past
the
walls
of
the
old
castle
she
laughed
out
though
she
was
all
alone
thinking
of
the
grave
gentleman
on
the
gray
horse
and
murmured
naughtily
to
herself
hope
i
did
hurt
him
oh
i
hope
i
hurt
him
then
she
knew
she
ought
not
to
hope
that
and
kissed
the
madonnina
that
hung
at
her
throat
and
asked
the
holy
pardon
and
then
laid
herself
down
on
the
little
hard
bed
and
went
as
sound
asleep
as
a
flittermouse
in
the
next
day
was
in
the
little
sleepy
town
upon
the
dart
where
the
ships
and
the
boats
go
by
on
the
gray
sea
and
the
brown
there
would
be
watermen
and
countrymen
both
in
numbers
farmers
and
fisherfolk
millers
and
peddlers
and
hucksters
and
and
wagoners
and
nonno
was
early
awakened
by
the
children
who
were
eager
to
begin
getting
more
pence
with
the
sunrise
the
pence
when
they
made
had
such
a
terrible
knack
of
flying
away
again
gemma
believed
that
they
grew
wings
like
the
butterflies
though
she
never
could
see
them
and
though
she
and
nonno
kept
such
close
watch
and
ward
over
them
they
made
themselves
as
spruce
as
they
could
for
the
day
gemma
had
washed
her
white
bodice
and
white
shirt
and
though
the
scarlet
and
the
blue
and
the
yellow
had
got
stained
and
the
clothes
yet
were
picturesque
and
with
their
curling
hair
and
their
beautiful
big
black
eyes
and
their
cheeks
as
warm
and
as
soft
as
peaches
she
and
bindo
were
a
pretty
sight
as
they
bent
and
swayed
and
circled
and
moved
now
so
slowly
now
so
furiously
in
the
changes
of
the
whilst
their
grandfather
played
for
them
on
a
little
wooden
flute
and
gemma
beat
her
tambourine
high
above
her
auburn
head
and
as
the
music
waxed
faster
and
the
dance
wilder
sprang
and
whirled
and
leaped
and
bounded
for
all
the
world
the
people
said
like
the
that
flashes
over
the
bogs
of
dartmoor
they
danced
with
pauses
for
rest
between
their
dances
all
the
day
long
and
when
they
were
so
very
tired
that
they
could
dance
no
more
nonno
began
his
simple
tricks
with
his
thimble
and
peas
his
wooden
cups
and
his
little
tray
full
of
cards
they
were
innocent
tricks
and
when
he
told
fortunes
by
the
cards
which
gemma
expounded
to
whosoever
would
pay
a
penny
to
hear
the
future
he
dealt
out
fate
so
handsomely
that
such
a
destiny
was
very
cheap
indeed
at
four
farthings
the
were
pleased
and
content
to
have
a
gilt
coach
and
horses
and
all
manner
of
good
luck
promised
them
over
the
cards
and
the
youths
liked
to
look
at
pretty
gemma
who
was
so
unlike
the
maidens
they
picked
apples
with
or
sold
pilchards
to
in
their
green
devon
and
so
the
day
wore
merrily
on
apace
and
the
afternoon
sun
was
slanting
towards
its
setting
over
the
cornish
shores
and
cornish
seas
far
away
to
the
westward
when
all
in
a
moment
there
was
a
shout
of
police
and
the
crowd
hustled
together
and
made
way
and
two
constables
with
wooden
truncheons
saying
never
a
word
marched
up
to
the
poor
little
swept
off
it
cards
and
coins
and
conjuring
toys
and
arrested
poor
old
trembling
nonno
in
the
sacred
name
of
the
law
nonno
began
to
scream
a
million
words
to
a
minute
but
alas
they
were
all
italian
words
nobody
understood
one
of
them
bindo
sobbed
and
gemma
standing
a
moment
transfixed
with
horror
flew
upon
the
constable
who
had
taken
her
poor
old
grandfather
and
bit
his
arm
till
the
blood
spurted
mad
with
pain
the
constable
seized
her
not
gently
and
clutched
bindo
by
the
collar
with
his
other
hand
there
was
no
possibility
of
resistance
gemma
fought
indeed
like
a
little
polecat
but
the
men
were
too
strong
for
her
they
soon
took
her
away
through
the
crowd
on
the
same
road
that
nonno
was
taking
peaceably
and
when
the
crowd
muttered
a
little
at
its
play
being
thus
spoiled
the
constables
only
said
gruffly
you
out
of
the
way
or
be
clapped
in
jail
too
maybe
posturing
gambling
swindling
this
old
dodger
will
have
a
month
of
treadmill
if
he
have
a
day
and
the
crowd
said
among
itself
that
to
be
sure
the
old
fellow
was
a
foreigner
it
would
not
do
to
get
into
trouble
about
him
and
most
likely
he
only
made
believe
to
know
the
future
so
left
him
to
himself
and
went
to
the
alehouses
and
consoled
themselves
for
his
misfortunes
in
draughts
of
cider
the
two
constables
meanwhile
consigned
the
old
man
and
his
grandchildren
to
the
nonno
kept
sighing
and
sobbing
and
asking
innumerable
questions
in
his
own
tongue
and
bindo
shrieked
at
the
top
of
his
voice
as
he
was
dragged
along
gemma
alone
now
that
she
was
vanquished
was
mute
her
lips
were
shut
and
silent
but
her
eyes
spoke
darting
out
flames
of
fire
as
if
vesuvius
itself
were
burning
behind
them
for
four
whole
years
they
had
been
wandering
about
the
southwest
part
of
england
and
had
done
no
less
and
no
more
than
they
had
done
and
never
had
they
been
told
that
it
was
wrong
how
could
it
be
wrong
to
make
a
pea
jump
away
from
under
a
wooden
cup
and
promise
a
ploughman
or
a
wagoner
a
coach
and
horses
if
it
pleased
him
for
if
nonno
did
cheat
a
little
ever
so
little
poor
old
man
the
children
did
not
know
it
and
whatever
nonno
did
was
always
to
them
alike
virtue
and
wisdom
the
constables
were
very
angry
with
them
gemma
had
bitten
one
of
them
as
if
she
were
a
little
and
the
old
man
seemed
to
them
a
sorry
old
rascal
living
by
his
wits
and
his
tricks
and
promising
the
yokels
to
turn
a
penny
foreigners
are
not
favored
by
the
rural
police
in
england
and
whether
they
have
plaster
casts
dancing
bears
singing
children
performing
mice
or
monkeys
or
only
a
few
conjuring
toys
like
poor
old
epifania
santo
it
is
all
one
to
the
rural
police
down
they
go
as
members
of
the
dangerous
classes
if
the
wanted
diversion
there
were
good
honest
punch
and
judy
generally
to
be
seen
on
and
once
or
twice
a
year
at
the
great
cider
or
horse
fairs
there
came
always
a
show
with
dwarfs
and
giants
and
a
calf
with
two
heads
what
more
could
any
country
population
need
in
the
way
of
entertainment
into
the
accordingly
they
put
poor
nonno
and
his
grandchildren
and
shut
and
locked
the
door
upon
them
it
was
now
there
was
clean
straw
in
the
place
and
a
mug
of
water
and
some
bread
nonno
and
bindo
abandoned
themselves
to
the
uttermost
hopelessness
of
despair
and
laid
themselves
face
downward
on
the
straw
sobbing
their
very
hearts
out
gemma
was
her
forehead
was
crimson
her
teeth
were
set
she
was
consumed
with
rage
that
burnt
up
alike
her
terror
and
her
pain
oh
why
did
not
a
handful
of
neapolitan
sailors
sail
over
the
water
and
land
and
kill
all
these
english
it
was
four
years
since
she
had
seen
naples
but
she
remembered
how
she
remembered
and
they
had
come
all
the
way
out
of
their
own
sunshine
only
to
be
locked
up
in
a
trap
like
rats
furious
thoughts
of
setting
fire
to
this
beset
her
she
had
matches
in
her
pocket
but
it
would
be
hard
to
set
it
on
fire
without
consuming
themselves
with
it
since
the
doors
were
fast
locked
what
could
she
do
what
could
she
do
do
they
take
us
we
have
done
no
harm
she
said
through
her
shut
teeth
sighed
her
grandfather
shivering
where
he
lay
on
the
straw
am
afraid
before
the
law
we
are
no
better
than
the
owls
and
the
are
we
are
only
vagabonds
we
have
no
dwelling
and
we
have
no
pay
for
our
lodging
and
we
pay
for
our
bread
they
do
not
believe
that
always
have
i
been
so
afraid
this
would
happen
and
now
it
has
come
at
the
poor
old
man
sank
back
on
the
straw
again
and
began
to
sob
piteously
why
had
he
left
the
merry
crowds
of
the
strada
del
male
where
there
was
always
a
laugh
and
a
song
and
a
slice
of
melon
or
of
at
last
both
he
and
bindo
sobbed
themselves
into
sleep
but
no
sleep
came
to
gemma
she
was
wide
awake
panting
hot
all
alive
with
fury
all
the
night
with
morning
they
were
all
taken
before
the
magistrates
who
were
sitting
that
day
there
were
a
great
many
gentlemen
and
officials
but
among
them
all
gemma
only
saw
one
the
horseman
whose
ears
she
had
boxed
in
the
lane
for
philip
carey
was
on
the
bench
that
day
and
recognized
with
not
much
pleasure
the
little
group
of
italian
strollers
they
all
three
looked
miserable
jaded
and
very
dusty
the
night
passed
in
the
had
taken
all
their
look
of
sunshiny
merriment
away
the
straw
had
caught
on
their
poor
garments
the
faces
of
nonno
and
the
little
boy
were
swollen
and
disfigured
with
crying
only
gemma
all
dishevelled
and
dusty
and
feverish
had
a
pride
and
ferocity
about
her
that
gave
her
strength
and
kept
her
beauty
as
she
was
the
only
one
who
could
talk
any
english
she
was
ordered
to
speak
for
the
others
but
when
she
said
her
name
was
epifania
santo
there
was
a
laughter
in
the
court
which
incensed
her
so
bitterly
that
she
flung
back
her
curls
out
of
her
eyes
and
said
you
do
not
believe
what
i
say
why
do
you
want
me
to
speak
then
being
once
started
she
went
on
before
any
of
the
magistrates
or
officials
could
stop
her
have
taken
us
up
why
have
you
taken
us
up
we
have
done
nobody
any
sort
of
harm
we
only
dance
and
nonno
tells
fortunes
and
does
the
tricks
and
you
have
taken
his
box
away
and
do
you
call
that
honest
to
a
poor
man
we
do
not
rob
we
do
not
kill
we
do
not
hurt
when
bindo
takes
an
apple
i
am
and
then
her
english
which
was
apt
to
go
away
from
her
in
moments
of
excitement
failed
her
utterly
and
she
poured
out
a
torrent
of
neapolitan
patois
which
not
a
soul
there
present
understood
only
from
her
flashing
eyes
and
her
expressive
gestures
it
was
easy
to
guess
that
it
meant
vehement
invective
and
reproach
carey
looked
at
her
attentively
but
he
said
nothing
his
brother
magistrates
when
she
had
been
peremptorily
ordered
to
be
still
and
listen
put
a
few
sharp
questions
to
her
and
examined
the
witnesses
who
were
policemen
and
and
who
all
deposed
to
the
fact
that
the
old
italian
did
tricks
and
told
fortunes
and
got
them
to
put
their
pence
down
by
fair
promises
and
had
moreover
dice
and
cards
whereby
he
induced
them
to
lose
money
the
children
only
danced
they
had
no
habitation
they
were
always
wandering
about
by
their
papers
they
were
natives
of
naples
then
the
constable
whose
arm
gemma
had
bitten
appeared
with
it
in
a
sling
and
stated
what
she
had
done
to
him
and
this
terrible
piece
of
violence
prejudiced
the
whole
court
greatly
against
her
carey
smiled
once
he
took
no
share
in
the
examination
but
gemma
was
always
looking
at
him
she
was
always
thinking
is
all
his
doing
because
i
struck
him
he
has
had
us
all
put
in
prison
because
i
offended
she
hated
him
how
she
hated
him
if
she
had
not
been
so
watched
and
warded
by
the
constables
she
would
have
leaped
across
the
court
and
done
the
same
thing
again
for
she
did
not
mind
anything
for
herself
but
if
they
put
nonno
and
bindo
back
in
prison
and
parted
them
from
her
knew
people
were
parted
in
prison
and
boys
and
girls
were
never
together
there
nor
ever
the
old
left
with
the
young
and
she
knew
too
that
in
england
there
were
prisons
called
workhouses
where
they
packed
away
all
the
people
who
were
poor
her
heart
stood
still
with
fright
and
all
she
saw
in
the
dusky
court
was
the
grave
face
of
philip
carey
which
seemed
to
her
like
the
stony
face
of
fate
sobbed
her
grandfather
in
a
whisper
is
the
gentleman
you
struck
as
he
rode
on
his
horse
you
have
been
our
undoing
with
your
fiery
temper
always
was
i
afraid
that
you
would
be
under
that
reproof
head
drooped
and
all
the
color
fled
out
of
her
cheeks
she
knew
that
it
was
a
just
one
bindo
meanwhile
was
clinging
to
her
skirts
and
whimpering
like
a
poor
little
beaten
puppy
till
she
thought
her
very
brain
would
go
mad
whirling
round
and
round
in
such
misery
the
magistrates
spoke
together
carey
alone
saying
little
there
was
a
strong
feeling
against
all
strollers
at
that
time
in
the
county
on
account
of
many
robberies
that
had
been
committed
on
outlying
farms
by
tramps
and
gypsies
in
the
last
few
years
and
many
raids
that
had
been
made
on
and
epifania
santo
and
his
grandchildren
only
seemed
to
the
bench
idle
useless
and
not
harmless
vagrants
no
better
than
the
as
old
nonno
had
said
whilst
the
fierce
onslaught
on
the
constable
of
which
gemma
had
been
guilty
gave
their
misdeeds
a
darker
color
in
the
eyes
of
the
devon
gentlemen
after
some
consultation
and
some
disagreement
among
the
magistrates
the
old
man
having
no
visible
means
of
subsistence
was
condemned
to
a
imprisonment
for
unlawfully
gambling
and
deceiving
the
public
whilst
bindo
and
gemma
were
respectively
ordered
to
be
consigned
to
reformatories
in
consideration
of
epifania
age
and
of
his
being
a
foreigner
he
was
spared
hard
labor
when
gemma
comprehended
the
sentence
and
the
old
man
had
been
made
to
understand
it
also
such
a
scene
of
grief
and
of
despair
ensued
as
no
english
court
had
ever
beheld
to
the
slow
and
stolid
folk
of
the
banks
of
dart
it
seemed
as
if
madness
had
descended
straight
upon
these
strangers
their
passionate
paroxysms
of
woe
had
no
limit
and
no
likeness
to
anything
ever
seen
in
devon
before
gemma
had
to
be
torn
by
main
force
from
her
brother
and
grandfather
and
writhing
in
the
hands
of
the
constables
as
an
otter
writhes
on
a
spear
she
shook
her
little
clinched
fists
at
the
bench
and
seeing
there
only
the
face
of
philip
carey
who
to
her
belief
was
sole
author
of
all
her
sorrows
and
ills
she
cried
to
him
struck
you
yesterday
i
will
hurt
you
more
before
many
days
are
over
you
are
a
wicked
wicked
wicked
man
then
the
policeman
seized
her
more
roughly
and
put
his
hand
over
her
mouth
and
carried
her
away
by
sheer
force
that
little
jade
really
strike
you
a
blow
carey
asked
one
of
his
in
surprise
carey
smiled
a
little
yes
he
said
quietly
i
had
deserved
wonder
you
wanted
us
to
be
more
lenient
can
not
be
revenged
on
a
child
he
answered
they
are
children
of
the
sun
they
have
hotter
passions
than
ours
and
quicker
oblivion
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
given
them
a
little
money
and
shipped
them
back
to
naples
but
you
outnumbered
me
the
old
man
is
inoffensive
i
think
after
all
a
penny
was
not
much
for
a
yokel
to
pay
to
be
blessed
by
the
promise
of
a
but
his
did
not
see
the
matter
in
this
light
and
thought
the
old
stroller
well
out
of
mischief
in
the
jail
of
dartmouth
philip
carey
two
days
before
would
have
thought
so
with
them
for
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
severe
on
the
bench
but
the
sunny
dusky
ardent
face
of
gemma
had
touched
him
and
the
love
of
the
three
for
each
other
seemed
enviable
to
him
he
had
been
all
alone
since
his
early
boyhood
and
such
affection
as
theirs
seemed
to
him
a
beautiful
and
priceless
treasure
it
was
cruel
he
thought
to
tear
it
asunder
as
cruel
as
to
pluck
all
to
pieces
a
red
rose
just
flowered
to
the
light
he
rode
home
that
evening
in
the
twilight
somewhat
saddened
and
doubtful
whether
the
law
was
as
just
and
unerring
a
thing
as
he
had
always
until
then
believed
it
the
night
saw
poor
old
nonno
put
in
prison
as
if
he
were
a
thief
and
saw
the
children
severed
and
taken
respectively
to
the
and
the
asylum
in
a
reformatory
for
naughty
children
which
some
good
people
with
the
best
intentions
had
built
and
endowed
in
the
neighborhood
they
had
so
clung
together
and
so
madly
resisted
being
parted
that
they
had
fairly
frightened
the
men
and
women
in
charge
of
them
they
had
never
been
away
from
each
other
an
hour
in
their
lives
ever
since
little
bindo
had
been
born
one
summer
day
in
the
cabin
by
the
mediterranean
and
laid
in
the
half
of
a
great
gourd
as
a
cradle
for
his
wondering
eyes
to
admire
but
severed
now
they
were
and
whilst
poor
bindo
in
the
ward
was
subjected
to
such
a
scrubbing
as
he
had
never
had
in
all
his
days
and
his
abundant
auburn
curls
were
cut
short
paroxysms
of
passion
had
given
place
to
a
stolid
and
strange
also
bathed
and
clothed
in
the
clothes
of
the
reformatory
whilst
her
sash
her
picturesque
petticoats
and
her
coral
and
necklace
were
all
taken
away
fumigated
rolled
up
in
a
bundle
and
ticketed
with
a
number
she
submitted
but
her
great
eyes
glared
and
glowed
strangely
and
she
was
perfectly
mute
not
a
single
sound
could
those
set
in
command
over
her
force
from
her
lips
the
superiors
were
used
to
stubborn
children
savage
children
timid
children
vicious
children
but
this
silence
of
hers
following
on
her
delirium
of
fury
and
grief
was
new
and
startling
to
them
she
looked
very
odd
clad
perforce
in
some
stiff
gray
clothes
and
when
she
was
set
down
one
of
a
long
row
to
have
supper
off
oatmeal
porridge
the
handsome
pale
desperate
little
face
of
hers
with
burning
eyes
and
an
arched
red
mouth
looked
amidst
the
faces
of
the
other
little
girls
like
a
carnation
among
not
a
morsel
would
she
eat
not
a
word
would
she
speak
at
no
one
would
she
even
look
nonno
oh
bindo
her
heart
kept
crying
till
it
seemed
as
if
it
would
burst
but
never
a
sound
escaped
her
poor
little
bindo
meanwhile
was
sobbing
every
minute
but
he
ate
his
porridge
though
he
watered
it
with
floods
of
tears
where
he
was
set
among
a
score
of
english
boys
who
were
gaping
and
grinning
at
him
with
the
close
of
evening
bindo
was
stowed
away
in
the
dormitory
and
gemma
was
led
to
one
of
a
number
of
narrow
little
iron
beds
with
blue
counterpanes
she
was
undressed
and
bidden
to
lie
down
which
she
did
her
bed
was
the
last
of
the
row
and
next
to
the
wall
she
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
and
they
thought
her
resigned
soon
the
light
was
put
out
and
the
little
sleepers
were
in
the
land
of
dreams
but
gemma
never
closed
her
eyes
her
heart
seemed
to
be
beating
all
over
her
body
she
stuffed
the
sheet
into
her
mouth
and
bit
it
hard
to
keep
in
the
cries
of
agony
that
sprang
to
her
lips
would
she
ever
see
nonno
again
bindo
she
might
perhaps
but
nonno
was
sure
he
would
die
in
prison
there
was
a
window
in
the
wall
near
the
bed
it
was
unshuttered
she
could
see
the
gray
of
the
evening
change
to
the
dark
of
the
night
and
then
the
moon
came
out
as
they
called
it
here
she
was
only
waiting
for
every
one
to
be
asleep
to
get
up
and
look
out
of
that
window
and
see
whether
it
would
let
her
escape
an
slept
in
the
dormitory
but
at
the
farther
end
where
everything
was
quite
hushed
and
when
the
slow
breathing
of
the
children
told
that
they
were
all
sleeping
soundly
gemma
got
up
in
her
bed
and
sat
erect
finding
all
was
still
she
put
one
foot
out
of
bed
and
then
another
and
very
softly
stole
to
the
window
it
was
a
lattice
window
and
left
a
little
open
for
the
night
was
warm
a
sweet
smell
of
moist
fields
of
growing
grass
of
honeysuckle
hedges
came
up
on
the
night
air
gemma
noiselessly
opened
the
window
a
little
farther
and
looked
out
it
was
far
far
down
to
the
ground
below
still
she
thought
it
was
possible
for
her
to
escape
she
stole
back
to
the
bedside
put
on
the
hideous
ungainly
cotton
clothes
as
well
as
she
could
in
the
dark
and
knotted
the
skirt
of
the
frock
tight
round
her
limbs
so
as
to
leave
them
untrammelled
if
no
one
awoke
she
could
get
away
she
reflected
for
her
quick
eyes
had
seen
a
that
passed
from
the
casement
to
the
ground
she
paused
a
few
moments
making
sure
quite
sure
that
every
one
in
the
long
dormitory
was
asleep
as
she
stood
she
saw
some
hundred
matches
lying
by
a
lamp
of
which
the
light
was
put
out
on
a
little
table
near
a
cruel
joy
danced
into
her
eyes
she
stretched
out
her
hand
and
took
the
matches
and
slipped
them
in
the
bosom
of
her
frock
then
with
the
courage
of
desperation
she
climbed
to
the
put
half
her
body
out
of
it
and
clinging
to
the
iron
pipe
with
both
hands
let
herself
slide
down
down
down
to
where
she
knew
not
all
was
dark
beneath
her
but
if
she
slid
into
the
sea
that
would
be
better
she
said
to
herself
than
to
live
on
imprisoned
as
it
happened
the
window
was
twenty
feet
and
more
from
the
earth
but
the
turf
was
beneath
and
the
was
so
made
that
she
could
easily
clasp
it
with
feet
and
hands
and
glide
down
it
only
grazing
all
the
skin
off
her
palms
and
bruising
her
knees
and
her
chest
no
one
heard
her
there
was
no
alarm
given
she
reached
the
ground
in
safety
as
a
village
clock
tolled
ten
she
dropped
all
in
a
heap
and
lay
still
half
stunned
for
some
moments
soon
she
got
her
breath
and
her
wits
again
and
rose
up
on
her
feet
and
looked
about
her
she
knew
all
the
well
having
been
here
ever
since
the
had
been
in
blossom
and
when
they
had
not
been
performing
having
scampered
hither
and
thither
with
bindo
begging
honey
or
eggs
at
the
cottages
or
coaxing
the
boatmen
to
let
them
drift
down
the
river
the
moon
was
now
very
bright
and
she
saw
that
she
stood
near
the
dart
water
and
she
could
discover
here
a
steeple
there
a
gable
yonder
a
windmill
and
so
forth
by
which
she
could
tell
where
she
was
she
had
been
brought
in
a
covered
van
to
the
reformatory
and
had
only
known
that
it
was
near
dartmouth
illustration
she
only
ran
on
stumbling
often
and
feeling
for
the
matches
in
the
bosom
of
her
ugly
gray
cotton
frock
the
grass
on
which
she
stood
grew
under
a
low
wall
and
beyond
the
wall
was
a
and
beyond
that
the
river
the
she
knew
well
she
and
bindo
had
often
ridden
on
the
backs
of
the
or
got
a
seat
in
the
big
barges
by
just
singing
their
little
songs
and
twanging
their
tambourines
the
served
her
purpose
well
she
looked
back
at
the
big
pile
behind
her
a
white
square
place
bindo
was
sleeping
under
its
roof
then
she
hardened
her
heart
vaulted
over
the
and
began
to
run
down
the
she
did
not
hesitate
for
she
had
a
very
wicked
resolve
in
her
soul
and
her
goal
was
four
miles
away
she
knew
as
a
on
the
other
bank
among
willows
was
an
old
friend
of
hers
and
told
her
her
whereabouts
not
a
sound
came
from
the
house
behind
her
not
a
creature
had
awakened
or
the
would
have
been
clanging
and
lights
appearing
at
every
window
she
was
quite
safe
thus
far
and
she
began
to
run
along
the
dewy
grassy
path
where
the
glowworms
were
twinkling
at
every
step
under
the
ferns
and
the
dock
leaves
wicked
wicked
man
she
kept
saying
in
her
teeth
she
never
saw
the
pretty
glowworms
she
was
so
fond
of
at
other
times
or
heard
the
nightingales
singing
in
the
woods
for
when
a
sin
is
in
the
soul
it
makes
the
eyes
blind
and
the
ears
deaf
she
only
ran
on
stumbling
often
and
feeling
for
the
matches
in
the
bosom
of
her
ugly
gray
cotton
frock
the
frock
was
irksome
to
her
she
longed
for
her
own
short
skirts
and
pliable
bodice
and
she
missed
the
scarf
about
her
loins
and
the
necklace
at
her
throat
but
she
ran
on
and
on
having
a
set
purpose
and
a
great
crime
in
her
mind
she
knew
that
if
she
only
followed
the
long
enough
she
would
come
to
the
place
called
honor
she
knew
it
well
she
had
often
looked
over
its
white
gates
and
envied
the
calves
and
the
lambs
in
its
pastures
and
wondered
what
the
rooms
were
like
within
beyond
the
windows
and
sighed
for
the
nectarines
and
the
cherries
that
grew
in
its
green
old
it
might
be
farther
or
nearer
than
she
fancied
that
she
could
not
be
sure
about
but
she
knew
that
if
she
went
on
long
enough
along
the
dart
water
she
would
come
to
it
she
did
not
feel
at
all
frightened
at
being
out
all
alone
so
late
after
the
excitement
and
despair
of
the
day
she
seemed
to
have
no
feeling
left
except
this
one
burning
consuming
terrible
longing
for
vengeance
which
made
her
feet
fly
over
the
to
the
peaceful
elizabethan
house
lying
among
its
yews
and
limes
and
stacks
and
hives
and
byres
in
the
moonlight
she
had
been
running
and
walking
an
hour
and
a
half
or
more
when
a
bend
in
the
water
showed
her
the
twisted
and
the
and
the
porches
of
the
homestead
with
the
moon
shining
above
it
and
the
green
uplands
sloping
behind
then
gemma
whose
young
soul
was
now
so
full
of
wickedness
that
there
was
not
a
spot
of
light
left
in
it
climbed
over
the
white
wooden
gate
and
crept
up
over
the
wide
where
the
cattle
were
asleep
and
the
big
daisies
were
shut
up
at
rest
the
air
was
full
of
the
sweet
smell
of
the
of
the
honeysuckle
of
the
sweet
brier
and
away
across
the
meadows
the
timbers
and
the
deep
gables
of
the
old
house
were
distinct
in
the
she
crossed
the
pastures
and
opened
a
little
wicket
that
was
never
latched
and
got
into
the
gardens
where
the
stocks
and
picotees
and
and
moss
roses
and
sweet
williams
and
all
other
dear
blossoms
were
filling
the
night
with
their
fragrance
but
gemma
had
no
thought
for
them
she
crept
on
up
to
the
house
and
saw
that
in
one
part
the
thatched
roof
came
down
so
low
to
the
ground
that
standing
on
a
stone
bench
which
was
beneath
she
would
be
able
to
touch
it
she
sprang
on
to
the
bench
drew
her
matches
out
of
her
bosom
struck
light
to
them
and
was
about
to
thrust
the
blazing
bunch
into
the
thatch
when
a
huge
dog
bounded
out
of
the
shadow
leaped
on
her
and
knocked
her
head
downwards
off
the
stone
seat
on
to
the
grass
he
would
have
torn
her
to
pieces
only
he
was
such
a
great
and
good
creature
that
seeing
she
was
a
child
he
was
merciful
in
his
strength
what
is
it
my
lad
said
philip
carey
as
he
came
out
from
the
open
door
of
the
porch
alarmed
at
the
noise
of
the
fall
the
newfoundland
left
her
and
went
to
his
master
and
carey
saw
the
form
of
gemma
lying
prone
upon
his
gravel
and
the
bundle
of
blazing
matches
still
clutched
in
her
clinched
hand
heavens
the
child
came
to
burn
my
house
down
he
cried
half
aloud
as
he
stooped
over
her
and
lifted
her
up
she
had
fallen
on
the
back
of
her
head
and
was
stunned
into
insensibility
for
the
moment
he
wrenched
the
burning
matches
out
of
her
fingers
and
stamped
the
fire
out
of
them
with
his
heel
that
was
soon
done
and
when
the
dangerous
things
were
mere
harmless
splinters
of
wood
he
lifted
the
insensible
form
of
the
child
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
into
his
house
has
escaped
from
the
reformatory
he
thought
as
he
saw
the
ugly
gray
cotton
gown
and
the
blue
apron
that
was
tacked
on
to
it
he
laid
her
gently
on
a
couch
and
called
his
housekeeper
a
kindly
old
woman
with
cheeks
like
the
apples
that
crowded
his
orchards
in
october
knocked
this
little
girl
down
and
she
is
senseless
with
the
fall
will
you
do
your
best
for
her
mary
she
is
one
of
the
home
children
he
said
to
the
old
dame
and
he
did
not
add
a
word
about
the
matches
the
simple
remedies
soon
recalled
gemma
back
to
her
senses
and
she
opened
her
great
frightened
humid
eyes
to
the
light
of
the
room
zolfini
i
zolfini
she
murmured
thinking
of
her
matches
and
vaguely
fancying
that
she
was
in
the
midst
of
flames
all
her
english
had
gone
clean
away
from
her
is
that
foreign
child
master
said
the
housekeeper
one
that
has
been
roaming
the
country
ever
since
candlemas
i
caught
her
little
brother
at
the
hen
house
at
and
spanked
him
they
were
both
of
them
sentenced
they
in
town
this
morning
and
the
old
grandfather
too
said
carey
curtly
has
run
away
that
is
evident
suppose
you
go
and
get
some
little
room
ready
for
her
for
she
will
not
be
able
to
go
back
she
is
all
right
now
i
fancy
though
she
is
not
yet
fairly
of
the
attics
master
shall
she
sleep
with
hannah
as
hannah
will
stomach
it
a
little
waif
and
stray
out
of
no
get
her
a
nice
little
room
ready
anywhere
you
like
but
one
that
is
comfortable
she
is
a
very
forlorn
little
maid
we
must
be
good
to
her
little
brother
was
at
the
and
i
spanked
is
not
her
brother
said
philip
carey
impatiently
me
with
her
a
though
her
master
was
very
gentle
the
housekeeper
knew
that
he
chose
to
be
obeyed
and
she
trotted
off
up
the
broad
oak
staircase
obediently
philip
carey
remained
beside
gemma
and
the
big
black
dog
also
sat
looking
at
her
with
his
head
held
critically
on
one
side
for
he
had
not
made
up
his
mind
about
her
came
to
burn
my
house
down
said
carey
gravely
as
he
looked
full
into
her
face
she
understood
what
he
said
but
she
did
not
answer
her
mind
was
still
confused
she
remembered
what
she
had
come
to
do
and
she
began
to
understand
that
she
had
failed
to
do
it
and
was
in
the
power
of
this
man
whom
she
hated
caught
you
in
the
act
he
continued
sternly
if
my
dog
had
not
thrown
you
down
you
would
probably
have
succeeded
for
old
thatch
burns
like
tinder
now
will
you
tell
me
why
you
wished
to
do
me
so
great
an
injury
gemma
was
still
mute
her
brows
were
drawn
together
her
eyes
underneath
them
were
flashing
and
sombre
she
had
raised
herself
on
one
arm
on
the
cushions
of
the
couch
and
gazed
at
him
in
silence
you
do
not
know
said
carey
the
crime
of
arson
the
crime
you
tried
to
commit
is
one
punished
by
only
less
severity
than
is
shown
to
murder
very
often
it
becomes
murder
too
when
people
are
burned
as
they
often
are
in
the
house
that
is
fired
for
the
mere
attempt
i
can
have
you
imprisoned
for
many
years
now
tell
me
i
order
you
to
tell
me
instantly
why
you
desired
to
injure
me
so
hideously
gemma
followed
his
words
and
gathered
their
meaning
and
felt
forced
to
obey
but
all
the
passion
of
hate
and
of
pain
in
her
surged
up
in
broken
utterances
for
the
foreign
language
was
ill
able
to
convey
all
the
vehemence
of
emotion
and
of
indignation
raging
in
her
heart
came
she
muttered
came
to
burn
your
house
yes
why
not
i
told
you
in
the
morning
i
would
do
something
worse
to
you
i
did
strike
you
but
you
had
deserved
it
you
had
said
i
was
immodest
and
then
because
you
were
angry
you
had
us
all
taken
up
by
the
police
and
you
put
dear
nonno
in
prison
as
if
he
were
a
thief
when
he
is
so
honest
that
he
scolds
bindo
if
bindo
takes
an
apple
and
you
have
parted
me
and
bindo
and
shut
us
in
a
horrible
place
and
they
have
cut
our
hair
and
washed
us
and
i
saw
i
could
get
away
and
i
did
and
i
dropped
through
the
window
and
the
matches
were
there
and
i
said
to
myself
i
would
burn
your
house
down
i
had
heard
people
say
that
you
were
fond
of
your
house
and
if
you
say
that
it
was
wicked
of
me
it
has
been
you
who
have
been
wicked
first
you
are
a
bad
vile
cruel
man
to
shut
dear
nonno
into
your
prisons
and
he
nearly
years
old
and
so
good
and
so
kind
and
so
merry
and
never
will
we
see
him
again
and
sooner
than
go
back
to
that
place
which
you
put
me
in
i
will
drown
myself
in
your
river
there
or
make
your
dog
tear
me
to
then
the
poor
little
soul
burst
into
a
rain
of
tears
enough
to
have
extinguished
a
million
lighted
lucifer
matches
or
the
very
fires
of
a
burning
house
had
there
been
one
philip
carey
allowed
the
tempest
of
grief
to
exhaust
itself
then
he
said
to
her
in
a
grave
and
very
sweet
voice
yet
a
little
sternly
poor
little
girl
you
were
ready
to
take
a
great
crime
on
your
little
white
soul
and
who
knows
where
its
evil
might
have
stopped
fire
is
not
a
plaything
now
i
want
you
to
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
about
myself
i
am
a
magistrate
and
i
was
on
the
bench
it
is
true
but
i
did
not
approve
of
the
sentence
passed
on
you
by
men
of
greater
age
and
weight
in
the
county
than
i
am
and
i
tried
my
best
vainly
to
have
it
mitigated
i
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
your
arrest
what
he
did
harmless
though
it
seems
was
yet
against
the
law
and
the
mayor
of
the
town
chose
to
enforce
the
law
against
him
more
than
this
my
dear
not
only
would
i
not
had
i
been
alone
have
sentenced
your
grandfather
in
so
severe
a
manner
but
i
would
have
aided
you
all
to
return
to
your
own
country
as
it
is
i
mean
to
use
what
influence
i
possess
to
endeavor
to
obtain
a
remission
of
your
sentence
and
i
meant
also
to
go
across
to
portsmouth
and
see
the
italian
consul
there
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
he
could
not
help
you
to
go
back
to
naples
if
i
could
succeed
in
getting
your
punishments
remitted
as
i
hoped
to
he
paused
and
gemma
gazed
at
him
with
dilated
eyes
and
a
hot
color
on
her
cheeks
she
was
silent
and
ashamed
you
have
spoiled
it
all
continued
carey
can
i
beg
for
a
little
incendiary
to
be
let
loose
on
the
world
and
my
gardener
will
see
those
lucifer
matches
in
the
morning
and
every
one
will
know
or
guess
then
what
you
came
to
do
and
why
my
dog
monarch
sprang
on
the
color
went
out
of
her
face
and
her
lips
quivered
it
was
only
she
said
piteously
would
not
have
tried
to
fire
your
house
nor
bindo
it
was
only
me
could
you
not
punish
me
all
by
myself
and
let
them
out
if
you
will
only
let
them
out
i
will
go
back
to
prison
and
i
will
not
run
away
again
i
will
bear
it
all
my
life
if
i
must
if
you
will
only
let
out
nonno
and
bindo
dear
answered
philip
carey
have
no
power
i
can
not
deal
you
out
life
and
death
as
you
seem
to
think
you
are
a
dangerous
and
fierce
little
tigress
of
that
there
is
no
doubt
but
i
do
not
think
the
reformatory
good
as
it
is
would
improve
you
much
suppose
we
make
a
bargain
if
you
will
promise
me
to
try
and
be
good
i
will
promise
you
to
try
and
liberate
you
all
three
and
send
you
all
back
in
a
good
ship
to
your
own
with
as
much
rapidity
as
she
had
sprung
up
on
his
saddle
to
box
his
ears
gemma
sprang
off
the
couch
and
to
his
great
amazement
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
kissed
him
you
are
good
she
murmured
rapturously
love
you
i
love
you
i
love
you
as
much
as
i
hated
you
yesterday
and
she
was
so
pretty
that
philip
carey
could
not
be
angry
with
her
any
more
she
slept
soundly
that
night
under
the
roof
she
had
tried
to
burn
and
in
the
morning
had
the
most
tempting
breakfast
brought
to
her
on
her
little
bed
that
she
had
ever
imagined
in
all
her
life
and
monarch
came
and
put
his
big
muzzle
down
on
the
snowy
counterpane
and
made
friends
with
her
over
honey
and
muffins
and
cream
carey
kept
his
promise
and
by
means
of
continuous
efforts
for
some
ten
days
succeeded
in
getting
the
release
of
poor
old
epifania
santo
and
of
bindo
and
obtaining
also
for
them
a
free
passage
by
a
then
loading
in
devonport
and
bound
to
go
down
channel
to
the
south
coast
of
italy
with
a
cargo
of
iron
and
steel
during
this
time
that
he
was
thus
returning
good
for
evil
and
exerting
himself
in
her
cause
gemma
remained
under
the
care
of
his
housekeeper
and
saw
him
very
often
in
each
day
and
had
a
simple
pretty
white
linen
frock
made
for
her
and
spent
all
her
time
in
the
gardens
and
orchards
and
meadows
with
monarch
and
the
other
dogs
of
the
house
when
philip
carey
at
last
announced
to
her
that
all
was
arranged
for
their
departure
by
the
and
that
she
would
meet
her
brother
and
grandfather
at
the
docks
he
was
surprised
to
see
a
cloud
sweep
over
her
mobile
face
and
great
tears
fill
her
eyes
once
more
can
not
we
stay
can
not
we
stay
she
said
with
a
sob
is
so
afraid
of
the
sea
and
bindo
will
be
so
sorry
to
leave
before
the
apples
are
ripe
and
me
can
not
bear
to
leave
you
like
me
a
little
then
said
carey
astonished
and
touched
so
much
said
gemma
with
a
great
sigh
have
been
so
kind
and
i
have
been
so
he
hesitated
a
moment
much
surprised
then
answered
it
might
perhaps
be
arranged
your
grandfather
is
very
old
for
a
voyage
and
there
is
a
little
cottage
down
beyond
my
orchards
that
he
might
have
but
gemma
if
i
let
you
stay
on
my
land
you
must
promise
me
to
be
very
reasonable
and
obedient
and
to
learn
all
you
are
told
to
learn
and
never
to
give
way
to
your
furious
i
will
be
so
good
she
cried
in
ecstasy
as
she
sprang
up
in
his
arms
and
kissed
him
again
will
be
so
good
and
when
i
am
with
you
i
forget
that
we
never
really
see
the
sun
and
bindo
says
he
is
sure
that
your
apples
are
better
than
our
grapes
and
figs
and
oranges
at
is
well
you
should
think
so
if
you
are
to
live
all
your
lives
amidst
the
apples
said
philip
carey
with
a
smile
so
they
stayed
there
and
a
few
years
later
when
gemma
had
grown
a
most
beautiful
young
girl
and
become
wise
and
gentle
as
well
though
she
still
kept
her
april
face
that
was
all
sunshine
and
storm
in
the
same
moment
philip
carey
made
her
his
wife
and
mistress
and
she
is
still
always
ready
to
declare
that
apples
are
the
best
and
sweetest
fruit
that
grows
for
you
see
love
gathers
them
for
her
the
little
earl
the
little
earl
was
a
very
little
one
indeed
as
far
as
years
and
stature
were
but
he
was
a
very
big
one
if
you
consider
his
possessions
and
his
importance
he
was
only
a
month
old
when
his
father
died
and
only
six
months
old
when
his
mother
too
left
him
for
the
cold
damp
vault
with
its
marbles
and
its
rows
of
velvet
coffins
vault
that
was
very
grand
but
so
chilly
and
so
desolate
that
when
they
took
the
little
earl
there
on
to
lay
his
flowers
down
upon
the
dead
he
could
never
sleep
for
nights
afterwards
remembering
its
darkness
and
solemnity
the
little
earl
was
called
hubert
hugh
lupus
alured
beaudesert
and
was
the
earl
of
avillion
and
lantrissaint
but
by
his
own
friends
and
his
grandmother
and
his
old
nurse
he
was
called
only
bertie
he
was
eight
years
old
in
the
when
there
befell
him
the
adventure
i
am
going
now
to
relate
to
you
and
he
was
for
his
age
quite
a
baby
he
was
slender
and
slight
and
he
had
a
sweet
little
face
like
a
flower
with
very
big
eyes
and
a
quantity
of
fair
hair
cut
after
the
fashion
of
the
reynolds
and
gainsborough
children
he
had
always
been
kept
as
if
he
were
a
china
doll
that
would
break
at
a
touch
his
grandmother
and
his
uncle
had
been
left
the
sole
charge
of
him
and
as
they
were
both
invalids
and
the
latter
a
priest
and
both
dwelt
in
great
retirement
at
the
castle
of
avillion
the
little
little
life
had
not
been
a
life
he
had
always
been
tranquil
for
every
one
loved
him
and
he
had
all
things
that
he
wished
for
yet
he
was
treated
more
as
if
he
were
a
rare
flower
or
a
most
fragile
piece
of
porcelain
than
a
little
bright
boy
of
real
flesh
and
blood
and
without
knowing
it
he
was
often
tired
of
all
his
he
was
such
a
tiny
fellow
you
see
to
be
the
head
of
his
race
and
the
last
of
it
too
for
there
were
no
others
of
this
great
race
from
which
he
had
sprung
and
his
uncle
as
a
priest
could
never
marry
thus
so
much
depended
on
this
small
short
life
that
the
fuss
made
over
him
and
the
care
taken
of
him
had
ended
in
making
him
so
incapable
of
taking
any
care
of
himself
that
if
he
had
ever
got
out
alone
in
a
street
he
would
have
been
run
over
to
a
certainty
and
as
he
grew
older
he
grew
sad
and
feverish
and
chafed
because
he
was
never
allowed
to
do
the
things
that
all
boys
by
instinct
love
to
do
by
nature
the
little
earl
was
very
brave
but
he
was
made
timid
by
incessant
cautions
and
as
he
was
too
by
nature
very
thoughtful
the
seclusion
from
other
children
in
which
he
was
brought
up
made
him
too
serious
for
his
age
avillion
was
in
woods
throned
high
above
a
lake
and
moors
and
mountains
and
setting
its
vast
stone
buttresses
firmly
down
into
the
greenest
smoothest
turf
in
all
the
green
west
country
of
england
a
grand
and
glorious
place
famous
in
history
full
of
majesty
and
magnificence
and
sung
to
forever
by
the
deep
music
of
the
atlantic
waves
once
upon
a
time
the
arthurian
court
that
tennyson
has
told
you
of
so
often
had
held
its
solemn
jousts
and
its
blameless
revels
there
at
least
so
said
the
story
of
avillion
as
told
in
ballads
of
the
trustworthy
historians
than
most
people
think
all
those
ballads
the
little
earl
knew
by
heart
and
he
loved
them
more
than
anything
for
deborah
his
nurse
had
crooned
them
over
his
cradle
before
ever
he
could
understand
even
the
words
of
them
so
that
arthur
and
launcelot
and
sir
gawain
and
sir
galahad
and
all
the
knightly
lives
that
were
once
at
tintagel
were
more
real
to
him
than
the
living
figures
about
him
and
these
fancies
served
him
as
his
playmates
he
had
few
others
except
his
dog
ralph
and
his
pony
royal
his
relatives
were
ailing
melancholy
attached
to
silence
and
solitude
and
though
they
would
have
melted
gold
and
pearls
for
drinking
if
he
could
have
drunk
them
never
bethought
themselves
that
noise
and
romps
and
laughter
and
fun
and
a
little
spice
of
peril
are
all
things
without
which
a
life
is
as
dead
and
spiritless
as
a
in
a
cage
and
bertie
did
not
know
it
either
he
studied
under
his
tutor
father
philip
a
noble
and
learned
old
man
and
he
was
caressed
and
cosseted
by
his
nurse
deborah
and
he
wore
beautiful
little
dresses
most
usually
of
velvet
and
he
had
wonderful
toys
that
were
sent
from
paris
automatons
that
danced
and
fenced
and
played
the
guitar
and
animals
that
did
just
what
live
animals
do
and
punches
and
puppets
that
played
and
mimicked
by
and
little
yachts
that
sailed
by
and
whole
armies
of
soldiers
and
marvellous
games
costly
and
splendid
but
he
had
nobody
to
play
at
all
these
things
with
and
it
was
dull
work
playing
with
them
by
himself
deborah
played
with
them
in
the
best
way
she
knew
but
she
was
not
a
child
being
years
old
and
was
of
a
slow
imagination
and
of
rheumatic
movements
and
play
father
philip
would
often
say
to
him
taking
him
perforce
from
his
books
but
the
little
earl
would
answer
sadly
have
nobody
to
play
with
that
want
of
his
attracted
no
attention
from
all
those
people
who
loved
the
ground
his
little
feet
trod
on
he
was
surrounded
with
every
splendor
and
indulgence
he
had
half
the
toys
of
the
palais
royal
in
his
nursery
and
he
had
a
bed
to
sleep
in
of
ivory
inlaid
with
silver
that
had
once
belonged
to
the
little
king
of
rome
millions
of
money
were
being
stored
up
for
him
and
lands
wide
enough
to
make
a
principality
called
him
lord
it
never
occurred
to
anybody
that
the
little
earl
of
avillion
was
not
the
most
fortunate
child
that
lived
under
the
sun
do
people
all
call
me
he
asked
one
day
suddenly
becoming
observant
of
this
fact
you
are
my
lord
said
deborah
did
not
content
him
he
asked
father
philip
dear
little
boy
it
is
your
title
think
not
of
it
save
as
an
obligation
to
bear
your
rank
well
and
without
at
last
the
little
earl
grew
so
pale
and
thin
and
so
delicate
in
health
that
the
physician
who
was
always
watching
over
him
said
to
his
grandmother
that
the
boy
wanted
change
of
air
and
advised
the
southern
coast
for
him
and
cessation
of
almost
all
study
which
order
grieved
father
philip
sorely
for
bertie
could
read
his
livy
well
and
was
beginning
to
spell
through
his
xenophon
and
it
cut
the
learned
gentleman
to
the
heart
that
his
pupil
should
give
up
all
this
and
go
back
on
the
royal
road
to
learning
for
both
he
and
his
uncle
were
resolved
that
the
little
earl
should
be
very
learned
and
the
boy
was
eager
enough
to
learn
only
he
liked
still
better
knowing
how
the
flowers
grew
and
why
the
birds
could
fly
while
he
could
not
and
how
the
made
his
neat
house
in
the
and
the
beaver
built
his
dam
across
the
river
which
everybody
about
him
was
inclined
to
discourage
natural
science
was
not
looked
on
with
favor
in
the
nursery
and
of
avillion
it
was
considered
to
lead
people
astray
so
the
little
earl
was
moved
southward
with
his
grandmother
and
his
nurse
and
his
physician
and
ralph
and
royal
he
would
not
go
without
them
several
servants
as
well
they
were
to
go
to
shanklin
in
the
isle
of
wight
and
they
made
the
journey
by
sea
in
the
beautiful
which
was
waiting
for
manhood
after
having
been
the
idol
of
his
on
board
the
little
earl
was
well
amused
but
he
worried
every
one
about
him
by
questions
as
to
the
fishes
child
they
are
but
nasty
clammy
things
only
nice
when
they
are
cooked
said
his
nurse
and
his
grandmamma
said
to
him
they
were
made
to
live
in
the
sea
just
as
the
birds
are
made
to
fly
in
the
and
this
did
not
satisfy
the
little
man
at
all
but
he
could
get
no
more
information
for
the
doctor
who
could
have
told
him
a
good
deal
was
under
the
thumb
of
his
stately
mistress
and
lady
avillion
had
said
very
sternly
that
the
boy
was
not
to
be
encouraged
in
his
nonsense
what
he
must
be
taught
were
the
duties
of
his
position
and
all
he
owed
to
the
country
poor
little
earl
he
was
a
very
small
slender
lord
indeed
with
his
golden
hair
hanging
over
his
puzzled
forehead
that
used
to
ache
sometimes
with
carrying
xenophon
and
livy
and
underneath
the
hair
two
great
wondering
blue
eyes
of
a
blue
so
dark
that
they
were
like
wet
violets
his
hands
were
tiny
and
thin
and
his
legs
clad
in
their
stockings
and
breeches
were
like
two
sticks
people
who
saw
him
go
by
whispered
about
him
and
said
all
the
poor
little
rank
and
riches
would
not
keep
him
long
in
the
land
of
the
living
once
the
little
earl
heard
that
said
and
understood
what
it
meant
and
thought
to
himself
mind
dying
if
i
could
take
ralph
perhaps
there
would
be
somebody
to
play
with
it
was
may
and
there
were
not
many
folks
at
shanklin
still
there
were
two
or
three
children
he
might
have
played
with
but
his
grandmamma
thought
them
vulgar
children
not
fit
playmates
for
him
and
so
the
poor
little
earl
with
the
burden
of
his
greatness
had
to
walk
soberly
and
sadly
past
them
with
his
little
tired
legs
while
the
little
girls
said
to
each
other
in
a
whisper
a
little
lord
and
the
boys
hallooed
out
the
swell
that
owns
the
bertie
would
sigh
as
he
heard
what
was
the
use
of
owning
the
schooner
when
you
had
no
one
to
play
with
on
it
and
never
could
do
what
you
liked
you
have
never
seen
shanklin
for
you
have
never
been
in
england
and
if
you
do
go
now
you
will
never
see
it
as
it
was
when
bertie
walked
there
when
it
was
the
prettiest
and
most
primitive
little
place
in
england
now
they
tell
me
it
has
been
made
into
a
with
a
pier
and
an
esplanade
shanklin
used
to
be
a
little
green
mossy
village
covered
up
in
honeysuckle
and
hawthorn
low
long
houses
green
too
with
ivy
and
creepers
hid
themselves
away
in
gardens
yellow
roads
ran
between
high
banks
and
hedges
out
to
the
green
down
or
downward
to
the
ripple
of
the
sea
and
the
cool
brown
sands
glistening
and
firm
twice
a
day
felt
the
kiss
of
the
tide
the
cliffs
were
brown
too
for
the
most
part
some
were
white
the
gray
sea
stretched
in
front
and
the
glory
of
the
place
was
its
leafy
chine
and
ravine
that
severed
the
rocks
and
was
full
of
foliage
and
of
the
sound
of
birds
it
used
to
be
all
so
quiet
there
now
and
then
there
passed
in
the
offing
a
brig
or
a
yacht
or
a
now
and
then
carts
came
in
from
the
downs
by
appuldurcombe
or
the
farms
beyond
the
undercliff
there
were
some
by
the
beach
and
one
old
inn
with
a
long
grassy
garden
where
the
coaches
used
to
stop
that
ran
through
the
quiet
country
from
ryde
to
ventnor
it
was
so
green
so
still
so
friendly
so
fresh
when
i
think
of
it
i
hear
the
swish
of
its
lazy
waves
and
i
smell
the
smell
of
its
eglantine
hedges
and
i
see
the
big
brown
eyes
of
my
gallant
dog
as
he
came
breathless
up
from
the
sea
alas
you
will
never
see
it
so
the
hedges
are
down
they
tell
me
and
the
grand
dog
is
dead
and
the
hateful
engine
tears
through
the
fields
and
the
sands
are
beaten
to
make
an
esplanade
and
the
beach
is
noisy
and
hideous
with
the
bray
of
bands
and
the
laughter
of
fools
what
will
the
world
be
like
when
you
are
twenty
very
frightful
i
fear
this
is
progress
they
say
but
what
of
the
little
earl
you
ask
well
the
little
earl
knew
shanklin
as
i
knew
it
the
blackbirds
and
thrushes
sang
in
the
quiet
chine
and
the
sense
of
an
infinite
peace
dwelt
on
its
simple
shores
his
grandmamma
had
taken
for
the
summer
the
house
that
stands
in
its
woods
at
the
head
of
the
chine
and
looks
straight
down
that
rift
of
greenery
to
the
gray
sea
i
know
not
what
that
house
is
now
then
it
was
charming
yet
spacious
here
the
little
earl
was
set
free
of
his
studies
and
kept
out
in
the
air
when
it
was
fine
and
when
it
rained
was
sent
not
to
his
books
but
to
his
toys
yet
it
did
not
seem
to
him
any
great
change
for
when
he
rode
james
was
with
him
and
when
he
walked
deborah
was
with
him
and
when
he
bathed
william
was
with
him
and
when
he
was
only
in
the
garden
there
was
grandmamma
he
was
never
alone
oh
how
he
longed
to
be
alone
sometimes
and
he
never
had
any
playfellows
how
he
would
watch
those
two
or
three
vulgar
little
boys
building
and
sailing
their
boats
he
would
have
given
all
his
big
schooner
and
its
crew
to
be
one
of
those
little
boys
he
had
a
cruise
now
and
then
off
the
island
and
the
skipper
came
up
and
hoped
my
lord
enjoyed
the
sail
but
he
did
not
enjoy
it
william
and
deborah
were
always
after
him
telling
him
to
mind
this
and
take
care
of
that
till
he
wished
his
pretty
sailor
dress
with
the
gold
buttons
were
only
rags
and
tatters
for
the
poor
little
earl
was
an
adventurous
and
curious
little
lad
at
heart
and
had
a
spirit
of
his
own
though
he
was
so
meek
and
he
was
tired
of
being
treated
like
a
baby
his
eighth
birthday
came
round
in
june
and
wonderful
and
magnificent
were
the
presents
he
had
sent
him
but
he
only
felt
a
little
more
tired
than
he
had
done
before
the
bonbons
he
was
not
allowed
to
eat
the
books
seemed
nonsense
to
a
little
classic
who
read
livy
the
toys
he
did
not
care
for
and
the
gold
his
grandmamma
gave
him
was
no
pleasure
he
had
one
in
silver
and
his
very
hair
he
was
never
permitted
to
brush
himself
i
may
not
eat
the
bonbons
might
i
send
them
all
to
the
children
on
the
sands
he
asked
wistfully
of
his
grandmother
my
love
she
answered
do
not
know
who
they
i
give
them
to
the
poor
children
then
said
the
little
lad
would
hardly
be
wise
dear
it
would
give
them
a
taste
for
bertie
sighed
life
on
this
his
eighth
birthday
seemed
very
empty
are
people
strangers
to
each
other
why
does
not
everybody
speak
to
every
one
else
he
said
at
last
desperately
paul
says
we
are
all
brothers
and
dear
child
do
not
talk
nonsense
said
lady
avillion
shall
have
you
a
radical
when
you
are
of
age
is
that
said
bertie
people
who
slew
your
dear
charles
the
first
were
radicals
said
his
grandmother
cleverly
he
was
discouraged
and
silent
he
went
sorrowfully
and
leaned
against
one
of
the
windows
and
looked
down
the
green
vista
of
the
chine
it
was
raining
and
they
would
not
let
him
go
out
of
doors
he
thought
to
himself
use
is
it
calling
me
lord
and
telling
me
i
own
so
much
and
bowing
down
before
me
if
i
may
never
do
once
just
once
as
i
like
i
know
i
am
a
little
boy
but
then
if
i
am
an
earl
if
i
am
good
enough
to
be
i
ought
to
be
able
to
do
once
as
i
like
else
if
not
what
is
the
use
and
why
does
the
skipper
say
always
to
me
lordship
is
owner
and
then
a
fancy
came
into
his
little
head
was
he
like
the
princes
in
the
tower
was
he
a
prisoner
after
all
his
little
mind
was
full
of
the
pageant
of
history
and
he
made
his
mind
up
now
that
he
was
a
princely
captive
watched
and
warded
me
dear
deb
he
said
catching
his
nurse
by
the
sleeve
as
she
turned
from
his
bed
that
night
me
is
it
not
true
that
i
am
in
prison
though
you
are
all
kind
to
me
that
somebody
else
wants
my
throne
nurse
deborah
thought
he
was
his
head
and
ran
to
the
physician
for
a
cooling
draught
and
sat
up
in
fright
all
the
night
not
even
reassured
by
his
sound
tranquil
sleep
bertie
asked
her
nothing
more
he
was
more
sure
than
ever
that
a
captive
he
was
kept
in
kindly
and
honorable
durance
like
james
of
scotland
in
the
green
tower
whilst
he
was
lying
awake
a
grand
and
startling
idea
dawned
on
him
what
if
he
were
to
go
out
and
see
the
world
for
himself
this
notion
has
fascinated
many
a
child
before
him
did
not
teresa
of
spain
when
she
was
a
little
thing
toddle
out
with
a
tiny
brother
over
the
brown
sierras
so
absolutely
now
did
this
enterprise
dazzle
and
conquer
the
little
earl
that
before
night
was
over
he
had
persuaded
himself
that
a
prisoner
he
and
that
his
stolen
kingdom
he
would
go
and
find
just
as
the
knights
in
his
favorite
tales
sallied
forth
to
seek
the
holy
grail
the
passion
for
adventure
for
escape
for
finding
out
the
truth
grew
so
strong
on
him
that
at
the
first
flush
of
daybreak
he
slid
out
of
bed
and
resolved
that
go
alone
he
would
he
longed
to
take
ralph
but
he
feared
it
would
not
be
right
who
knew
what
perils
or
pains
awaited
him
to
make
the
dog
sharer
in
them
seemed
selfish
so
he
threw
a
glove
of
his
own
for
ralph
to
guard
bade
him
be
still
and
set
about
his
own
flight
he
made
a
sad
bungle
of
dressing
himself
for
he
had
never
clothed
himself
in
his
life
but
at
last
he
got
the
things
on
somehow
and
most
of
them
but
he
did
it
all
without
awaking
deborah
and
taking
his
he
managed
to
drop
out
of
the
window
on
to
the
sward
below
without
any
one
being
aware
it
was
quite
early
day
the
sky
was
red
the
shadows
and
the
mists
were
still
there
the
birds
were
piping
to
each
other
lovely
it
is
he
thought
why
everybody
get
up
at
sunrise
he
knew
however
that
if
he
wanted
to
see
the
world
by
himself
he
must
not
tarry
there
and
think
about
the
dawn
so
off
he
set
as
fast
as
his
not
very
strong
legs
could
carry
him
and
he
got
down
to
the
shore
the
fog
was
on
the
sea
and
screened
it
from
his
sight
and
there
was
no
one
on
the
beach
except
a
boy
getting
nets
ready
in
an
old
boat
to
the
boy
ran
bertie
and
held
to
him
two
you
row
me
to
bonchurch
for
that
he
asked
the
boy
grinned
sure
little
master
and
like
to
row
a
dozen
at
the
into
the
boat
jumped
the
little
earl
with
all
the
feverish
agility
given
to
prisoners
who
are
escaping
by
their
freed
instincts
it
was
a
very
old
dirty
boat
and
soiled
his
pretty
white
clothes
terribly
but
he
had
no
eyes
for
that
he
so
enjoyed
that
delicious
sense
of
being
all
alone
and
doing
just
as
he
liked
the
boy
was
a
big
boy
and
strong
and
rowed
with
a
will
and
the
old
tub
went
jumping
and
bobbing
and
splashing
through
the
rather
heavy
swell
the
gig
of
his
yacht
was
a
smart
long
boat
beautifully
clean
and
with
rowers
all
dressed
in
red
caps
and
white
jerseys
but
the
little
earl
had
never
enjoyed
rowing
in
half
so
much
there
had
been
always
somebody
to
look
after
him
and
say
lean
over
the
side
or
the
water
does
not
splash
you
or
care
oh
that
tiresome
care
it
makes
a
boy
want
to
jump
into
the
sea
or
fling
himself
from
the
nearest
i
know
you
have
felt
so
yourself
twenty
times
a
week
though
i
do
not
tell
you
that
you
were
right
nothing
is
prettier
than
the
undercliff
as
you
look
up
at
it
from
the
sea
tangle
of
myrtle
and
laurel
and
beech
and
birch
coming
down
to
the
very
shore
all
as
nature
made
it
bertie
as
the
boat
wabbled
along
like
a
fat
old
duck
looked
up
at
it
and
was
enchanted
and
then
he
looked
at
the
white
wall
of
mist
on
the
waters
and
was
enchanted
too
it
was
like
wonderland
his
dreams
were
broken
by
the
voice
have
to
put
you
ashore
at
the
creek
little
master
and
get
back
or
give
me
a
is
said
the
boy
lick
me
for
the
bertie
was
perplexed
he
had
heard
of
bears
being
licked
into
shape
by
their
fathers
and
mothers
but
this
boy
though
rough
and
rather
shapeless
looked
too
old
for
such
treatment
were
a
wicked
boy
to
use
the
boat
then
he
said
with
great
severity
the
lad
only
grinned
master
you
tipped
me
a
did
not
mean
to
tempt
you
to
do
wrong
said
bertie
very
seriously
still
and
then
he
colored
for
was
he
very
sure
that
he
was
not
doing
wrong
himself
the
old
boat
was
grinding
on
the
shingle
then
and
the
rower
of
it
was
putting
him
ashore
at
a
little
creek
that
was
wooded
and
pretty
and
up
which
the
sea
ran
at
high
tide
there
was
a
little
cottage
at
the
head
of
it
i
have
heard
that
this
used
to
be
in
the
old
time
a
very
famous
place
for
smugglers
and
it
is
still
solitary
and
romantic
or
at
least
was
so
still
when
the
little
earl
was
set
down
there
am
i
he
asked
the
boy
but
the
wicked
boy
only
grinned
and
began
to
wabble
back
through
the
water
as
fast
as
his
long
slashing
strokes
could
carry
him
the
little
earl
felt
rather
foolish
and
rather
helpless
he
was
not
far
on
his
way
towards
seeing
the
world
and
he
began
to
wish
for
some
breakfast
there
was
smoke
going
out
of
a
chimney
of
the
cottage
and
the
door
of
it
stood
open
but
he
was
afraid
the
people
there
might
stop
him
if
he
asked
for
anything
and
besides
the
path
up
to
it
through
the
glen
looked
rocky
and
thorny
and
impassable
so
he
kept
along
by
the
beach
finding
it
heavy
walking
for
there
were
more
stones
than
sands
and
the
beach
was
strewn
with
rocks
large
and
small
and
stiff
prickly
furze
but
he
had
the
sea
beside
him
and
the
world
before
him
and
he
walked
on
bravely
and
in
a
little
while
he
came
into
bonchurch
it
was
very
early
yet
and
bonchurch
was
asleep
and
most
of
its
snug
thatched
houses
hidden
away
in
their
gardens
and
fuchsia
hedges
were
shut
up
snugly
the
tall
trees
of
its
one
street
made
a
deep
shadow
in
it
and
the
broad
placid
water
of
its
great
pool
was
green
with
their
reflection
it
was
a
sweet
quiet
place
leafy
as
any
haunt
for
fairies
yet
on
the
very
edge
of
the
sea
at
a
shop
a
woman
was
lifting
down
the
shutters
the
little
earl
took
his
hat
off
very
prettily
and
said
to
her
you
please
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
sell
me
some
the
woman
stared
then
laughed
bless
your
pretty
face
i
only
sell
bread
but
give
you
some
milk
in
for
sake
of
your
pinched
cheeks
come
along
inside
little
he
went
inside
it
seemed
a
very
funny
place
to
him
so
small
and
so
dark
and
so
dusty
with
flour
but
the
smell
of
baking
was
sweet
and
he
was
hungry
she
bustled
about
a
little
and
set
before
him
a
bowl
of
with
a
wooden
spoon
to
eat
it
with
the
little
earl
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
to
pay
for
it
lo
he
had
not
a
farthing
he
turned
very
red
and
then
very
white
and
thought
to
himself
that
the
money
must
have
tumbled
into
the
sea
with
his
watch
which
was
missing
too
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
the
wicked
boy
had
taken
both
yet
such
was
the
sad
fact
he
rose
very
sorrowful
and
confused
and
ashamed
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
in
his
little
ceremonious
way
thought
i
had
money
but
i
have
lost
it
thank
you
very
much
but
i
can
not
take
the
the
woman
was
and
shrewd
sup
it
up
my
dear
little
gentleman
she
said
to
him
are
welcome
to
it
welcome
you
are
and
your
pa
and
your
ma
can
pay
for
no
murmured
bertie
getting
very
red
and
fearing
lest
his
longing
for
the
meal
should
overcome
his
honor
he
stumbled
out
of
the
door
and
ran
up
the
road
faster
than
ever
he
had
run
in
his
life
to
be
sure
he
had
plenty
of
money
of
his
own
they
all
said
so
but
he
never
knew
well
where
it
was
or
what
it
meant
and
besides
he
intended
never
to
go
back
to
his
grandmother
and
deborah
and
ralph
and
royal
any
more
till
he
had
found
out
the
truth
and
seen
his
kingdom
so
he
ran
on
through
bonchurch
and
out
of
it
leaving
its
pleasant
green
shade
with
a
little
sigh
half
of
impatience
half
of
hunger
he
did
not
go
on
by
the
sea
for
he
knew
by
hearsay
that
this
way
would
take
him
to
ventnor
and
he
was
afraid
people
in
a
town
would
know
him
and
stop
him
so
he
set
forth
inland
where
the
deep
lanes
delve
through
the
grassy
downs
and
here
sitting
on
a
stile
the
little
earl
saw
the
ploughboy
eating
something
white
and
round
and
big
that
he
himself
had
never
seen
before
must
be
something
very
delicious
to
make
him
enjoy
it
so
much
thought
the
little
earl
and
then
curiosity
entered
so
into
him
and
he
longed
so
much
to
taste
this
wonderful
unknown
thing
that
he
went
up
to
the
boy
and
said
to
him
you
be
so
kind
as
to
let
me
know
what
you
are
eating
the
ploughboy
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
certain
little
zurr
he
said
with
a
burr
and
a
drawl
in
his
speech
and
he
gave
the
thing
to
bertie
which
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
peeled
turnip
the
little
earl
looked
at
it
doubtfully
for
he
did
not
much
fancy
what
the
other
had
handled
with
his
big
brown
hands
and
bitten
with
his
big
yellow
teeth
but
then
to
enjoy
anything
as
much
as
that
other
had
enjoyed
it
and
to
taste
something
quite
unknown
counterbalanced
his
disgust
and
his
delicacy
one
side
of
the
great
white
thing
was
unbitten
he
took
an
eager
tremulous
little
bite
out
of
that
oh
he
cried
in
dismay
as
he
tasted
has
no
taste
at
all
and
what
there
is
is
nasty
is
main
good
said
the
boy
said
the
little
earl
with
intense
horror
and
he
threw
the
turnip
down
amongst
the
grass
and
went
away
sorely
puzzled
master
roared
hodge
after
him
bet
as
you
that
was
it
of
course
the
little
earl
was
not
really
hungry
had
been
really
hungry
in
all
his
life
but
this
explanation
of
natural
philosophy
did
not
occur
to
him
not
even
when
the
boy
hallooed
it
after
him
he
only
said
to
himself
can
that
boy
eat
that
filthy
thing
and
he
really
did
look
as
if
he
liked
it
so
presently
after
trotting
a
mile
or
so
he
passed
a
little
shop
set
all
by
itself
at
the
end
of
a
lane
the
tiniest
loneliest
shop
in
great
britain
but
a
old
woman
kept
it
and
he
saw
it
had
bread
in
it
as
well
as
many
other
stuffs
and
tin
canisters
that
were
to
him
incomprehensible
you
please
he
said
rather
timidly
offering
the
gold
anchor
off
the
ribbon
of
his
hat
have
lost
my
money
and
could
you
be
so
kind
as
to
give
me
any
breakfast
for
this
the
old
woman
smelt
the
anchor
bit
it
twinkled
her
eyes
and
then
drew
a
long
face
worth
tuppence
master
she
said
mighty
small
to
be
out
by
yourself
and
puny
like
i
say
as
how
i
feed
said
bertie
who
did
not
know
at
all
what
his
anchor
was
worth
in
out
dust
said
the
old
woman
smartly
and
then
she
bustled
about
and
set
him
down
in
her
little
den
to
milk
bread
and
some
cold
bacon
that
he
had
no
appetite
was
the
despair
of
his
people
and
physician
at
home
and
oil
steel
quinine
and
all
manner
of
nastiness
had
been
administered
to
provoke
hunger
in
him
with
no
effect
by
this
time
however
he
had
almost
as
much
hunger
as
the
boy
who
had
munched
the
turnip
nothing
had
ever
tasted
to
him
half
so
good
in
his
life
the
old
woman
eyed
him
curiously
a
runaway
she
thought
not
raise
the
cry
after
ye
or
come
spying
about
this
bit
she
said
to
herself
that
the
child
would
come
to
no
harm
and
when
a
while
had
gone
by
she
would
step
over
to
ryde
or
newport
and
get
a
guinea
on
the
brooch
her
little
general
shop
was
not
a
very
prosperous
business
though
useful
to
the
and
sanding
her
sugar
and
putting
clay
in
her
mustard
and
adding
melted
fat
to
her
butter
had
not
strengthened
her
moral
principles
as
bertie
was
eating
there
came
a
very
thin
woman
who
held
out
a
halfpenny
sup
milk
for
susy
missus
she
said
in
a
very
pitiful
faint
voice
be
sue
asked
the
mistress
of
the
shop
the
woman
shook
her
head
with
tears
running
down
her
hollow
cheeks
boy
gone
in
spinney
she
murmured
try
and
catch
summat
if
he
can
will
you
change
it
missus
if
he
git
a
good
bird
the
old
woman
winked
frowned
and
glanced
at
bertie
good
on
fust
of
july
she
observed
as
she
handed
the
milk
the
woman
paid
the
halfpenny
and
hurried
away
with
the
milk
think
that
woman
is
very
poor
said
bertie
questioningly
and
solemnly
the
old
dame
chuckled
doubts
that
you
are
cruel
to
take
her
money
you
should
have
her
the
ho
little
sir
be
you
a
parson
in
a
gownd
mappen
poor
as
she
and
hiv
desarved
all
she
gits
for
her
man
he
were
a
poacher
and
he
died
in
jail
last
poacher
said
bertie
with
the
natural
instinctive
horror
of
a
landed
gentleman
her
son
was
going
to
snare
a
bird
he
cried
with
light
breaking
in
on
him
you
would
give
them
things
in
exchange
for
the
bird
oh
what
a
very
cruel
what
a
very
woman
you
are
for
an
answer
she
shied
at
him
a
round
wooden
trencher
which
missed
its
aim
and
struck
a
basket
of
eggs
and
smashed
them
and
one
of
the
panes
of
her
as
well
bertie
got
up
and
walked
slowly
out
of
the
door
keeping
his
eyes
upon
her
i
see
a
magistrate
i
shall
tell
him
about
you
he
said
solemnly
tempt
poor
people
that
is
very
the
enraged
woman
in
her
outraged
feelings
threw
a
pail
of
dirty
water
after
him
some
of
which
splashed
him
and
completed
the
disfigurement
of
his
white
suit
he
looked
up
and
down
to
see
for
the
poor
woman
with
the
milk
that
he
might
console
her
poverty
and
open
her
eyes
to
her
sins
but
she
was
not
within
sight
and
bertie
reflected
that
if
he
stopped
to
correct
other
errors
he
should
never
see
the
world
and
find
his
kingdom
he
had
eaten
a
hearty
meal
and
his
spirits
rose
and
his
heart
was
full
of
hope
and
valor
and
if
he
had
only
had
ralph
with
him
he
would
have
been
quite
happy
so
he
went
away
valorously
across
a
broad
rolling
down
and
about
half
a
mile
farther
on
he
came
to
a
little
shed
in
the
shed
were
a
fire
and
a
man
and
a
pig
in
the
fire
was
an
iron
and
the
pig
was
tied
by
a
rope
to
a
ring
bertie
saw
the
man
take
the
iron
and
go
up
to
the
pig
face
grew
blanched
with
horror
stop
what
are
you
doing
to
the
pig
he
screamed
as
he
ran
in
to
the
man
who
looked
up
and
stared
be
branding
the
pig
get
out
or
brand
you
he
cried
bertie
held
his
ground
his
eyes
were
flashing
wicked

planted
himself
firmly
on
his
feet
and
doubled
his
little
fists
will
not
see
you
do
such
a
cruelty
to
a
poor
dumb
thing
he
said
while
he
grew
white
as
death
will
the
man
scowled
and
yet
grinned
you
beat
me
little
bertie
put
himself
before
the
poor
black
pig

was
squealing
from

the
scorch
of

whole

but
he

not

pardon
for
cheeking
me
you
are
a
wicked
eyes
closed
he
grew
faint
he
fully
believed
that
in
another
instant
he
would
feel
the
hissing
fire
of
the
brand
but
he
did
not
yield
the
hand
dropped
to
his
side
a
plucked
one
he
said
once
more
child
it
was
a
joke
such
a
rare
game
un
to
humor
you
there
let
the
crittur
go
without
marking
her
but
a
rare
little
fool
if
not
an
angel
down
from
on
eyes
filled
with
tears
he
held
his
hand
out
royally
to
be
kissed
as
he
was
used
to
do
at
avillion
the
big
man
crushed
it
in
his
own
brown
paw
a
game
un
he
muttered
with
wonder
and
awe
you
will
never
never
never
burn
pigs
any
more
said
bertie
searching
his
face
with
his
own
serious
large
eyes
brand
this
un
said
the
man
with
a
shamefaced
laugh
little
sir
the
first
is
ever
got
as
much
as
that
out
of
me
you
must
do
it
said
bertie
solemnly
is
wicked
of
you
and
god
is
angry
and
it
is
very
mean
for
you
such
a
big
man
and
so
strong
to
hurt
a
defenceless
dumb
thing
you
must
do
is
your
name
little
master
said
the
big
man
humbly
call
me
then
say
william
all
the
days
of
my
life
at
my
prayers
sundays
said
the
man
with
some
emotion
and
murmured
to
himself
a
game
un
i
never
very
much
said
bertie
gently
and
then
he
lifted
his
hat
politely
and
went
out
of
the
shed
before
the
man
could
recover
from
his
astonishment
when
the
little
earl
looked
back
he
saw
the
giant
pouring
water
on
the
fire
and
the
pig
was
loose
afraid
thought
bertie
he
should
have
burnt
me
all
up
every
bit
i
never
would
have
given
and
something
seemed
to
say
in
his
ear
loveliest
thing
in
all
the
world
is
courage
that
goes
hand
in
hand
with
mercy
and
these
two
together
can
work
miracles
like
by
this
time
bertie
except
for
a
certain
inalienable
grace
and
refinement
that
were
in
his
little
face
and
figure
had
few
marks
of
a
young
gentleman
his
snowy
serge
was
smirched
and
stained
with
blackberries
his
red
stockings
from
the
and
the
had
none
of
their
original
color
his
hat
had
been
bent
and
crumpled
by
his
fall
and
his
hair
was
rough
nobody
passing
him
could
have
dreamt
that
this
sorry
wanderer
was
a
little
earl
nevertheless
when
he
had
been
dressed
in
his
little
court
suit
and
had
been
taken
to
see
the
queen
once
at
balmoral
he
had
never
been
a
quarter
so
proud
nor
a
tenth
part
so
happy
he
longed
to
meet
cromwell
and
richard
the
third
and
gessler
and
nero
he
began
to
feel
like
all
the
knights
he
had
ever
read
of
and
those
were
many
illustration
girl
why
do
you
cry
he
said
presently
he
saw
a
little
maiden
weeping
she
was
an
ugly
little
maiden
with
a
shock
head
of
red
hair
and
a
wide
mouth
and
a
brickdust
skin
but
she
was
crying
in
his
present
heroic
mood
he
could
not
pass
her
by
unconsoled
girl
why
do
you
cry
he
said
stopping
in
the
narrow
green
lane
she
looked
at
him
out
of
a
sharp
little
eye
and
her
face
puckered
up
afresh
going
to
schule
little
master
school
do
you
mean
and
why
does
that
make
you
cry
can
you
read
said
the
maiden
and
sobbed
loudly
why
are
you
not
glad
to
go
and
learn
said
bertie
in
his
superior
wisdom
naebody
to
do
nowt
at
home
said
the
one
with
a
howl
abed
sick
and
hurt
his
leg
and
mind

bertie
sympathetically
why

then
i

the
nymph
only

and

bertie
did
not
understand
he
had
never

of
the
school
board

father

he
asked
all
on
us

scalt
allers
get
the
kittle
if
he
it
is
very
shocking
not
to
know
how
to
read
said
the
little
earl
very
gravely
should
have
learned
that
as
soon
as
you
could
speak
i
yours
folk
said
the
little
girl
stung
by
her
agony
to
sarcasm
allers
had
a
baby
to
mind
ever
since
i
toddled
first
tam
and
then
dick
and
now
this
un
i
dunno
want
to
read
make
bricks
but
you
will
learn
such
beautiful
things
said
bertie
do
think
you
know
that
you
to
go
to
the
gemman
said
as
pit
dad
in
said
the
recalcitrant
one
doggedly
things
much
count
sir
when
empty
i
go
to
the
blackguds
now
if
as
poor
dad
says
as
how
i
must
they
lock
him
seems
very
hard
to
lock
him
up
said
bertie
with
increasing
sympathy
i
think
you
ought
to
obey
him
and
go
i
will
see
if
i
can
find
the
baby
where
do
you
live
she
pointed
vaguely
over
the
copses
and
pastures
on
a
mile
and
see
jim
cottage
but
lord
love
you
manage
will
try
said
bertie
sweetly
his
fancy
as
well
as
his
charity
was
stirred
for
he
had
never
that
he
knew
of
seen
a
baby
indeed
you
should
go
to
said
the
groaning
and
blowsy
heroine
with
a
last
sob
and
then
she
set
off
running
as
quickly
as
a
pair
of
her
boots
ten
times
too
large
allowed
her
her
slate
and
her
books
making
a
loud
clatter
as
she
struggled
on
her
way
he
was
by
this
time
very
tired
for
he
was
not
used
to
such
long
walks
but
curiosity
and
compassion
put
fresh
spirit
into
his
heart
and
his
small
legs
pegged
valorously
over
the
rough
ground
the
red
stockings
and
the
silver
buckles
becoming
by
this
time
much
begrimed
with
mud
he
knocked
at
one
cottage
door
and
saw
only
a
very
cross
old
woman
who
flourished
a
broom
at
him
it
jim
get
you
gone
look
like
a
now
a
runaway
he
was
and
as
truth
when
we
are
guilty
is
always
even
as
a
sword
bertie
colored
up
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
and
bolted
off
as
fast
as
he
could
to
the
only
other
cottage
visible
beyond
a
few
acres
of
and
all
the
lucern
family
which
the
little
earl
fancied
were
shamrocks
for
he
was
far
on
in
euclid
could
speak
german
well
and
could
spell
through
tacitus
fairly
but
about
the
flowers
of
the
field
and
the
grasses
no
one
had
ever
thought
it
worth
while
to
tell
him
anything
at
all
indeed
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
not
think
his
tutors
knew
anything
about
them
themselves
this
other
cottage
was
so
low
so
covered
up
in
its
broken
thatch
which
in
turn
was
covered
with
lichen
and
was
so
and
that
bertie
thought
it
was
a
ruined
however
it
stood
where
the
had
pointed
so
he
took
his
courage
in
both
hands
as
we
say
in
french
and
advanced
to
it
the
rickety
door
stood
open
and
he
saw
a
low
miserable
bed
with
a
miserable
woman
lying
on
it
a
boy
sprawled
on
the
floor
another
crouched
before
a
fire
of
brambles
and
sods
and
between
the
legs
of
this
last
boy
was
a
strange
uncouth
shapeless
object
which
but
for
the
fact
that
it
was
crying
loudly
never
would
have
appeared
to
his
astonished
eyes
as
the
baby
for
whom
was
prophesied
a
tragic
and
early
end
by
the
kettle
the
boy
who
had
this
object
in
charge
stared
with
two
little
round
eyes
a
young
gemman
he
said
in
an
awed
voice
bertie
took
off
his
hat
and
went
into
the
room
with
his
prettiest
grace
you
please
are
you
very
ill
he
said
in
his
little
soft
voice
to
the
woman
in
bed
little
girl
who
was
so
anxious
about
the
baby
and
i
said
i
would
come
and
see
if
i
could
be
of
any
the
woman
raised
herself
on
one
elbow
and
looked
at
him
with
eager
haggard
eyes
little
sir
naught
to
be
done
for
us
unless
you
had
a
or
have
no
money
murmured
bertie
feeling
very
unlike
a
little
earl
in
that
moment
the
woman
gave
a
weary
angry
sigh
and
sank
back
indifferent
i
do
nothing
said
bertie
wistfully
golly
said
the
boy
on
the
floor
got
a
few
coppers
little
repeated
the
little
earl
said
the
boy
shortly
then
the
baby
began
to
howl
and
the
boy
shook
it
please
not
make
it
scream
so
said
bertie
is
what
you
call
the
baby
is
it
not
said
the
boy
dick
sullenly
baby
cuss
him
and
what
bisness
be
he
of
yourn
for
interference
without
coppers
to
follow
was
a
barren
intruder
that
he
was
disposed
to
resent
thought
i
could
amuse
him
said
bertie
timidly
told
your
sister
i
dick
roared
into
loud
guffaws
kick
you
into
middle
next
week
you
poor
little
puny
said
this
rude
boy
and
bertie
felt
that
he
was
very
rude
though
he
had
no
idea
what
was
meant
by
the
other
boy
who
was
lying
on
his
stomach
sadly
empty
little
stomach
reversed
his
position
and
stared
up
at
bertie
think
a
kind
little
gemman
he
said
cross
broke
his
legs
and
had
no
vittles
since
yesternoon
and
only
a
sup
tea
peg
made
afore
she
went
and
main
bad
that
she
and
tears
rolled
down
this
gentler
little
dirty
cheeks
dear
what
shall
i
do
said
bertie
with
a
sigh
if
he
had
only
had
the
money
and
the
watch
that
had
fallen
into
the
sea
he
looked
round
him
and
felt
very
sick
it
was
all
so
dirty
so
dirty
he
had
never
seen
dirt
before
and
the
place
smelt
very
close
and
sour
and
the
clothes
were
mere
rags
and
the
woman
was
all
skin
and
bone
on
her
wretched
straw
bed
and
the
unhappy
baby
was
screaming
loudly
enough
to
be
heard
right
across
the
sea
to
the
french
coast
poor
baby
cry
so
said
bertie
very
softly
and
he
dangled
the
ends
of
his
red
sash
before
its
tearful
eyes
and
shook
them
up
and
down
the
attention
of
the
baby
was
arrested
it
ceased
to
howl
and
put
out
its
hands
and
began
to
laugh
instead
bertie
was
very
proud
of
his
success
and
even
the
sullen
dick
muttered
i
never
the
little
earl
undid
his
scarf
and
let
the
baby
pull
it
towards
itself
eyes
twinkled
greedily
for
summat
you
must
not
sell
it
said
the
little
earl
eagerly
is
to
amuse
the
poor
baby
and
what
pretty
big
eyes
he
has
how
he
laughs
shoes
sell
muttered
dick
dick
begging
muttered
tam
bertie
stared
in
surprise
to
sell
his
shoes
seemed
as
odd
as
to
be
asked
to
sell
his
hair
or
his
hands
the
woman
opened
her
fading
glazing
eyes
honest
boys
little
sir
pardon
of
eat
nothing
since
yesternoon
and
then
only
a
carrot
or
two
and
boys
is
main
have
you
nothing
said
bertie
aghast
at
the
misery
in
this
unknown
world
we
have
anything
said
the
sick
woman
grimly
locked
up
my
man
and
sent
to
school
while
we
starve
and
nobody
earns
for
broke
his
leg
and
naught
in
my
breasts
for
would
not
somebody
you
work
the
began
bertie
do
nowt
for
us
a
methody
and
at
they
mind
us
if
we
be
there
well
good
work
and
get
paid
and
if
we
there
un
else
is
then
she
sank
back
gasping
bertie
stood
and
perplexed
you
say
my
shoes
would
sell
he
murmured
very
miserably
his
mind
going
back
to
the
history
of
martin
and
the
cloak
dick
brightened
up
at
once
get
three
on
maybe
more
down
in
village
take
the
little
things
murmured
the
mother
feebly
but
faintness
was
stealing
on
her
and
darkness
closing
over
her
sight
shillings
said
bertie
who
knew
very
little
of
the
value
of
shillings
seems
very
little
i
they
cost
sovereigns
could
you
get
a
loaf
of
bread
with
three
shillings
grinned
dick
and
bertie
understood
that
the
guttural
sound
meant
assent
and
rapture
i
can
not
walk
without
yah
walk
better
we
niver
have
no
shoes
said
dick
you
no
walk
ten
times
finer
ye
trip
nor
stumble
nor
and
run
as
fast
no
i
shall
not
murmured
bertie
and
he
was
going
to
say
that
he
would
be
ashamed
to
be
seen
without
shoes
only
he
remembered
that
as
these
boys
had
none
that
would
not
be
kind
a
desperate
misery
came
over
him
at
the
thought
of
being
shoeless
but
then
he
reasoned
with
himself
give
was
no
charity
if
it
cost
you
nothing
did
not
the
saints
strip
themselves
to
the
uttermost
shred
for
the
poor
he
stooped
and
took
off
his
shoes
with
the
silver
buckles
on
them
and
placed
them
hastily
on
the
floor
them
if
they
will
get
you
bread
he
said
with
the
color
mounting
in
his
face
dick
seized
them
with
a
yell
of
joy
that
i
go
here
tam
run
quick
and
sell
to
old
nan
and
get
bread
and
meat
and
potatoes
and
milk
for
baby
and
lord
knows
what
a
gill
of
gin
for
think
we
ought
to
rob
little
master
dick
murmured
little
tam
his
brother
hurled
a
crutch
at
him
and
tam
snatched
up
the
pretty
shoes
and
fled
blazes
sir
said
dick
with
rather
a
shamefaced
look
a
beast
like
a
lot
of
fire
gnawing
at
your
belly
all
night
long
yer
stick
at
nowt
to
get
bertie
only
imperfectly
comprehended
the
baby
tired
of
the
sash
began
to
cry
again
and
dick
grown
danced
it
up
and
down
old
are
you
said
bertie
on
eight
said
dick
me
sighed
the
little
earl
this
rough
masterful
boy
seemed
like
a
grown
man
to
him
split
on
us
said
dick
sturdily
is
that
asked
bertie
tell
anybody
you
give
us
the
shoes
be
a
piece
of
if
one
when
one
did
any
kindness
murmured
bertie
with
a
disgust
he
could
not
quite
conceal
mean
when
one
does
you
gammon
with
at
home
want
to
know
what
done
with
your
am
not
going
home
said
the
little
earl
and
there
was
a
something
in
the
way
he
spoke
that
silenced
tongue
he
would
have
called
his
clapper
in
the
world
be
the
little
swell
arter
thought
dick
bertie
meanwhile
with
some
awe
and
anxiety
was
watching
the
livid
face
of
the
sick
woman
he
had
never
seen
illness
or
death
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
very
ill
indeed
you
not
anxious
about
your
mother
he
asked
of
the
rough
boy
said
dick
sulkily
with
the
water
coming
in
his
eyes
in
the
wuss
still
young
worse
than
death
said
bertie
solemnly
will
come
come
round
with
a
drop
of
gin
and
a
sup
of
broth
said
dick
confidently
all
hunger
and
hers
am
glad
i
gave
my
shoes
thought
bertie
then
there
was
a
long
silence
broken
only
by
the
hissing
of
the
green
brambles
on
the
fire
and
the
yelps
of
the
baby
sir
said
dick
after
a
little
put
the
saucepan
on
i
move
with
this
here
leg
if
pit
some
water
out
kittle
in
him
be
ready
for
when
the
vittles
will
do
that
said
bertie
cheerfully
and
he
set
the
saucepan
on
by
lifting
it
with
both
hands
it
was
very
black
and
its
crock
came
off
on
his
knickerbockers
then
by
directions
he
found
a
pair
of
old
wooden
bellows
and
blew
on
the
sticks
and
sods
but
this
he
managed
so
ill
that
dick
wriggled
himself
along
the
floor
closer
to
the
fire
and
did
it
himself
a
gaby
he
said
to
his
benefactor
is
that
said
bertie
but
dick
felt
that
it
was
more
prudent
not
to
explain
in
half
an
hour
tam
burst
into
the
room
breathless
and
joyous
his
scruples
having
disappeared
under
the
basket
he
bore
gived
me
five
he
shouted
sure
wuth
a
deal
more
her
eyes
twinkled
and
winked
and
she
shoved
me
a
in
us
shrieked
dick
in
an
agony
at
being
bound
to
the
floor
with
all
these
good
things
before
his
sight
little
tam
who
was
very
loyal
laid
them
all
out
on
the
ground
before
his
elder
two
quartern
loaves
two
pounds
of
beef
onions
potatoes
a
bit
of
bacon
and
a
jug
of
milk
dick
poured
some
milk
into
an
old
tin
mug
and
handed
it
roughly
to
bertie
the
baby
will
yer
whiles
tam
and
me
cooks
the
little
earl
took
the
can
and
advanced
to
the
formidable
bundle
of
rags
who
was
screaming
like
a
very
hoarse
raven
think
you
should
attend
to
your
mother
first
he
said
gently
as
the
baby
made
a
grab
at
the
little
tin
pot
the
look
of
which
it
seemed
to
know
and
shook
half
the
milk
over
itself
mammy
said
tam
who
was
gnawing
a
bit
of
bread
and
with
his
bread
in
one
hand
he
got
up
and
put
a
little
gin
and
water
quite
hot
between
his
lips
she
swallowed
it
without
opening
her
eyes
or
seeming
to
be
conscious
and
tam
climbed
down
from
the
bed
again
with
a
clear
conscience
gie
her
some
broth
he
said
manfully
while
he
and
dick
munching
bread
and
raw
bacon
tumbled
the
beef
in
a
lump
into
the
saucepan
drowned
in
water
with
some
whole
onions
in
the
common
fashion
of
the
baby
meanwhile
was
placidly
swallowing
the
milk
that
the
little
earl
held
for
it
very
carefully
and
when
that
was
done
accepted
a
crust
that
he
offered
it
to
suck
the
two
boys
were
crouching
before
the
crackling
fire
munching
voraciously
and
watching
the
boiling
of
the
old
black
pot
they
had
quite
forgotten
their
benefactor
peg
say
when
to
home
chuckled
tam
say
that
cooked
better
growled
dick
the
fat
good
bertie
stood
aloof
pleased
and
yet
sorrowful
because
they
did
not
notice
him
even
the
baby
had
so
completely
centred
its
mind
in
the
crust
that
it
had
abandoned
all
memory
of
the
red
scarf
bertie
looked
on
a
little
while
but
no
one
seemed
to
remember
him
the
eyes
were
glowing
on
the
saucepan
and
their
cheeks
were
filled
out
with
food
as
the
cherubs
in
his
chapel
at
home
were
puffed
out
with
air
as
they
blew
celestial
trumpets
he
went
to
the
door
slowly
looked
back
and
then
retreated
into
the
sunshine
would
be
mean
to
put
them
in
mind
of
me
he
thought
as
he
withdrew
suddenly
a
sharp
pain
shot
through
him
a
stone
had
cut
his
unshod
foot
dear
me
how
ever
shall
i
walk
without
any
shoes
or
boots
he
thought
miserably
and
he
was
very
nearly
bursting
out
crying
on
the
edge
of
these
fields
was
a
wood
low
dark
rolling
wood
looked
to
the
little
earl
who
missed
his
own
forests
inviting
and
cool
and
sweet
by
this
time
it
was
getting
towards
noon
and
the
sun
was
hot
and
he
felt
thirsty
and
very
tired
he
was
sad
too
he
was
glad
to
have
satisfied
those
poor
hungry
children
but
their
indifference
to
him
when
they
were
satisfied
was
chilling
and
melancholy
then
we
ought
not
to
do
a
kindness
that
we
may
be
thanked
he
said
to
himself
is
a
proper
punishment
to
me
because
i
wished
to
be
thanked
which
was
so
he
settled
as
he
usually
did
that
it
was
all
his
own
fault
happily
for
him
the
ground
was
soft
with
summer
dust
and
so
he
managed
to
get
along
the
little
path
that
ran
from
the
cottage
through
the
and
from
there
the
path
became
grass
which
was
still
less
trying
to
his
little
red
stockings
yet
he
was
anxious
and
troubled
he
felt
heavily
weighted
for
his
battle
with
the
world
without
any
shoes
on
and
he
felt
he
must
look
ridiculous
for
the
first
time
martin
did
not
seem
to
him
so
very
much
of
a
hero
because
gift
was
only
a
cloak
besides
without
his
sash
the
band
of
his
knickerbockers
could
be
seen
and
he
was
afraid
this
was
indecent
nevertheless
he
went
on
bravely
if
lamely
believe
me
nothing
sets
the
world
more
straight
than
thinking
that
what
is
awry
in
it
is
self
the
wood
which
was
a
spinney
famous
for
pheasants
was
reached
before
very
long
though
with
painful
effort
it
was
chiefly
composed
of
old
and
blackthorn
with
here
and
there
a
larch
or
holly
the
undergrowth
was
thick
and
the
sunbeams
were
playing
at
with
the
shadows
far
away
over
the
fields
and
thorns
was
a
glimmer
of
blue
water
and
close
around
were
all
manner
of
ferns
of
foxgloves
of
grasses
of
boughs
the
tired
little
earl
sank
downward
under
one
of
the
old
thorns
with
feet
that
bled
a
wasp
had
stung
him
too
through
his
stocking
and
the
stung
place
was
smarting
furiously
how
much
more
christ
and
the
saints
suffered
thought
bertie
seriously
and
piously
without
the
smallest
touch
of
vanity
lying
on
the
moss
under
all
that
greenery
he
felt
refreshed
and
soothed
although
the
foot
the
wasp
had
stung
throbbed
a
good
deal
there
were
all
sorts
of
pretty
things
to
see
the
pheasants
who
were
lords
of
the
manor
till
october
came
round
did
not
mind
him
in
the
least
and
swept
smoothly
by
with
their
long
tails
like
court
mantles
sweeping
the
grass
blackbirds
those
cheeriest
of
all
birds
pecked
at
worms
and
grubs
quite
near
him
chaffinches
were
looking
for
hairs
under
the
brambles
to
make
their
second
summer
nest
with
any
hairs
serve
their
purpose
or
and
if
they
get
a
tuft
of
or
they
are
furnished
for
the
year
a
pair
of
little
were
busy
in
a
low
bush
gathering
the
that
grew
thickly
there
and
a
goldfinch
was
flying
away
with
a
lock
of
wool
in
his
beak
there
were
other
charming
creatures
too
a
mole
was
hurrying
to
his
underground
castle
a
nuthatch
was
at
work
on
a
rotten
and
a
gray
bird
was
impaling
a
dead
on
one
of
the
bertie
did
not
know
that
this
gentleman
was
but
the
gray
shrike
once
used
in
hawking
indeed
he
did
not
know
the
names
or
habits
of
any
of
the
birds
and
he
lay
still
hidden
in
the
ferns
and
watched
them
with
delight
and
mute
amazement
there
were
thousands
of
such
pretty
creatures
in
his
own
woods
and
brakes
at
home
but
then
he
was
never
alone
he
was
always
either
walking
with
father
philip
or
riding
with
william
and
in
neither
case
was
he
allowed
to
stop
and
loiter
and
lie
in
the
grass
and
the
sonorous
voice
of
the
priest
scattered
these
timid
dwellers
in
the
greenwood
as
surely
as
did
the
tread
of
the
hoofs
and
the
barking
of
ralph
i
am
a
man
i
will
pass
all
my
life
out
of
doors
and
i
will
get
friends
with
all
these
pretty
things
and
ask
them
what
they
are
doing
he
thought
and
he
was
so
entranced
in
this
new
world
hidden
away
under
the
low
hawthorn
boughs
of
this
spinney
that
he
quite
forgot
he
had
lost
his
shoes
and
did
not
know
where
he
would
sleep
when
night
came
he
had
quite
forgotten
his
own
existence
indeed
and
this
is
just
the
happiness
that
comes
to
us
always
when
we
learn
to
love
the
winged
and
brethren
that
nature
has
placed
so
near
us
and
whom
alas
we
so
shamefully
neglect
when
we
do
not
do
even
worse
and
persecute
them
bertie
was
quite
oblivious
that
he
was
a
runaway
who
had
started
with
a
very
fine
idea
or
finding
out
who
it
was
that
kept
him
in
prison
and
giving
him
battle
wherever
he
might
be
he
was
much
more
interested
in
longing
to
know
what
the
great
gray
shrike
was
and
why
it
hung
up
the
mouse
on
the
thorn
and
flew
away
if
you
do
not
know
any
more
than
he
did
i
may
tell
you
that
the
shrikes
are
like
your
father
and
like
their
game
when
it
has
been
many
days
in
the
larder
it
is
one
of
the
few
ignoble
tastes
in
which
birds
resemble
mankind
the
shrike
flew
away
to
look
for
some
more
mice
or
frogs
or
little
snakes
or
cockroaches
or
beetles
for
he
is
a
very
useful
fellow
indeed
in
the
woods
though
the
keepers
are
usually
silly
and
wicked
enough
to
try
and
kill
him
his
home
and
his
young
ones
were
above
in
the
thicket
and
he
had
stuck
all
round
their
nests
insects
of
all
kinds
still
he
was
a
provident
bird
and
was
of
opinion
that
every
one
should
work
while
it
is
day
when
the
shrike
flew
away
after
a
the
little
earl
fell
asleep
what
with
fatigue
and
excitement
and
the
heat
of
the
sun
a
sound
dreamless
slumber
fell
upon
him
there
among
the
birds
and
the
sweet
smell
of
the
may
buds
and
the
goldfinch
sang
to
him
while
he
slept
such
a
pretty
song
that
he
heard
it
though
he
was
so
fast
asleep
the
goldfinch
though
did
not
sing
for
him
one
bit
in
the
world
he
sang
for
his
wife
who
was
sitting
among
her
callow
brood
hidden
away
from
sight
under
the
leaves
and
with
no
greater
anxiety
on
her
mind
than
fear
of
a
possible
weasel
or
rat
gnawing
at
her
nest
from
the
bottom
when
the
little
earl
awoke
the
sun
was
not
full
and
golden
all
about
him
as
it
had
been
there
were
long
shadows
slanting
through
the
spinney
and
there
was
a
great
globe
descending
behind
the
downs
of
the
western
horizon
it
was
probably
about
six
in
the
evening
bertie
could
not
tell
for
unluckily
for
him
he
had
always
had
a
watch
to
rely
upon
and
had
never
been
taught
to
tell
the
hour
from
the
in
the
or
calculate
the
time
of
day
from
the
length
of
the
shadows
even
now
though
night
was
so
nigh
the
thought
of
where
he
should
find
a
bed
did
not
occur
to
him
for
he
was
absorbed
in
a
little
boy
who
stood
before
him
very
miserable
little
boy
who
was
staring
hard
at
him
he
i
am
sure
is
as
poor
as
dick
and
tam
thought
the
little
earl
i
have
nothing
left
to
give
the
little
boy
was
endeavoring
to
hide
behind
his
back
a
bright
bundle
of
ruffled
feathers
and
in
his
other
hand
he
held
a
complicated
arrangement
of
twine
and
twigs
with
a
pendent
noose
that
bertie
did
know
the
look
of
for
he
had
seen
his
own
keepers
destroy
such
things
in
his
own
woods
and
had
heard
them
swear
when
they
did
so
so
his
instincts
awoke
in
him
though
the
land
was
not
his
little
boy
he
said
rubbing
his
eyes
and
springing
to
his
feet
a
wicked
wicked
little
boy
you
are
you
have
been
snaring
a
pheasant
the
small
boy
who
was
about
his
age
looked
frightened
and
penitent
he
saw
his
accuser
was
a
little
gentleman
sir
tell
on
me
he
said
with
a
whimper
gie
ye
the
bird
if
ye
tell
on
do
not
want
the
bird
said
bertie
with
magisterial
gravity
are
a
wicked
little
boy
to
offer
it
to
me
it
is
not
your
own
and
you
have
killed
it
you
are
a
sir
whimpered
the
little
poacher
allus
tooked
like
he
is
a
thief
too
said
bertie
was
a
good
un
to
me
said
the
small
boy
and
then
fairly
burst
out
sobbing
was
a
good
un
to
me
and
dead
a
year
come
and
mother
main
bad
and
little
got
the
croup
and
nowt

and
i
hear
susie
and
so
i
gae
to
cupboard
where

and
i
gits
out
this
here
and
says
i
to
myself

one
of
them
birds
spinney
they
make
rare
broth
and
we
had
a
many
on
when
dad
was
alive
and

towser

our
lurcher
keeper
shot
him
bring

in
his
mouth
like

chrisen

gin
tell

in
prison
like
they
did
dad
and
birch
rods
give

and
nowt
but
do
not
know
who
owns
this
property
said
bertie
in
his
little
sedate
way
i
could
not
tell
the
owner
and
i
should
not
wish
to
do
it
if
i
could
but
still
it
is
a
very
wicked
thing
to
snare
birds
at
all
and
when
they
are
it
is
know
as
how
they
makes
it
so
demurred
the
son
dad
said
as
one
makes
it
so
said
bertie
with
a
little
righteous
anger
so
the
birds
are
not
yours
and
so
if
you
take
them
you
are
a
the
boy
put
his
thumb
in
his
mouth
and
dangled
his
dead
pheasant
a
discussion
on
the
was
beyond
his
powers
nor
was
even
bertie
conscious
of
the
mighty
subject
he
was
opening
though
the
instincts
of
the
were
naturally
in
him
and
it
seemed
to
him
so
shocking
to
find
a
boy
with
such
views
as
this
as
to
and
that
he
almost
fancied
the
sun
would
fall
from
the
sky
the
sun
however
glowed
on
low
down
in
the
wood
beyond
a
belt
of
firs
and
the
green
downs
and
the
gray
sea
and
the
little
sinner
stood
before
him
fascinated
by
his
appearance
and
frightened
at
his
words
you
know
who
owns
this
coppice
asked
bertie
and
the
boy
answered
him
reluctantly
sir
what
you
must
do
said
bertie
to
go
directly
with
that
bird
to
sir
henry
and
beg
his
pardon
and
ask
him
to
forgive
you
go
at
once
that
is
what
you
must
the
boy
opened
eyes
and
mouth
in
amaze
i
never
do
he
said
doggedly
be
took
up
to
the
lodge
afore
open
my
if
i
go
with
you
said
bertie
you
one
of
the
sir
said
bertie
and
then
was
silent
in
some
confusion
for
he
bethought
him
that
without
any
shoes
on
he
might
also
be
arrested
at
the
lodge
gates
thought
as
not
barefoot
said
the
boy
with
a
little
contempt
supplying
the
place
of
courage
who
you
be
sir
but
seems
to
i
as
no
call
to
preach
to
me
you
be
bertie
colored
am
not
doing
any
harm
he
said
with
dignity
are
you
have
been
stealing
if
you
are
not
really
a
wicked
boy
you
will
take
the
pheasant
straight
to
that
gentleman
and
beg
him
to
forgive
you
and
i
dare
say
he
will
give
you
no
work
for
my
son
said
the
little
poacher
half
sadly
half
sullenly
keepers
are
all
agen
us
as
much
as
mother
and
me
and
susie
can
do
to
git
a
bit
work
can
you
do
can
make
the
gins
said
the
little
sinner
touching
the
trap
with
pride
i
never
comes
out
daylight
but
all
the
forenoon
susie
was
going
off
her
head
want
summat
sorry
for
susie
and
you
said
the
little
earl
with
sympathy
indeed
indeed
nothing
can
excuse
a
theft
or
make
keepers
yelled
the
boy
with
a
scream
like
a
and
he
dashed
into
the
bushes
casting
on
to
lap
the
gin
and
the
dead
bird
bertie
was
so
surprised
that
he
sat
perfectly
mute
and
still
the
little
boy
had
disappeared
as
fast
as
a
rabbit
bolts
at
sight
of
a
ferret
two
grim
big
men
with
dogs
and
guns
burst
through
the
hawthorn
and
one
of
them
seized
the
little
earl
with
no
gentle
hand
little
blackguard
smart
for
this
yelled
the
big
man
and
birch
rod
or
a
bertie
was
so
surprised
still
that
he
was
silent
then
with
his
little
air
of
innocent
majesty
he
said
simply
are
mistaken
i
did
not
kill
the
now
if
bertie
had
had
his
usual
nicety
of
apparel
or
if
the
keeper
had
not
been
in
a
fuming
fury
the
latter
would
have
easily
seen
that
he
had
accused
and
apprehended
a
little
gentleman
but
no
one
in
a
violent
rage
ever
has
much
sense
or
sight
left
to
aid
him
and
big
george
as
this
keeper
was
called
did
not
notice
that
his
dogs
were
smelling
in
a
friendly
way
at
his
prisoner
but
only
saw
that
he
had
to
do
with
a
lad
without
shoes
and
very
untidy
and
who
had
snares
and
a
snared
pheasant
at
his
feet
before
bertie
had
even
seen
him
take
a
bit
of
cord
out
of
his
pocket
he
had
tied
the
little
hands
behind
him
picked
up
the
pheasant
and
the
trap
and
given
some
directions
to
his
companion
the
real
culprit
was
already
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
burrowing
safely
in
the
earth
of
an
old
fox
killed
in
february
with
which
he
was
very
familiar
bertie
meanwhile
was
quite
silent
he
was
thinking
to
himself
i
tell
them
another
boy
did
it
they
will
go
and
look
for
him
and
catch
him
and
put
him
in
prison
and
then
his
mother
and
susie
will
be
so
miserable
miserable
than
ever
i
think
i
ought
to
keep
quiet
jesus
never
said
anything
when
they
buffeted
you
little
get
it
this
time
said
the
keeper
knotting
the
string
tighter
about
his
wrists
and
speaking
as
if
he
had
had
the
little
earl
very
often
in
such
custody
are
a
very
rude
man
said
bertie
with
the
angry
color
in
his
cheeks
but
big
george
heeded
him
not
being
engaged
in
swearing
at
one
of
his
dogs
young
one
who
was
trotting
after
a
rabbit
know
who
this
youngster
is
bob
he
said
to
his
companion
the
radley
shaver
over
from
bertie
wondered
who
the
radley
shaver
was
that
resembled
him
has
the
looks
on
him
said
the
other
prudently
dining
at
chigwell
and
have
started
afore
we
get
there
continued
big
george
you
on
through
spinney
far
as
edge
pool
and
take
and
lock
this
here
radley
up
till
morning
blast
his
impudence
pheasant
think
of
the
likes
of
it
a
pheasant
if
had
been
a
rabbit
had
been
bad
then
he
shook
his
little
captive
vigorously
bertie
did
not
say
anything
he
was
not
in
trepidation
for
himself
but
he
was
in
an
agony
of
fear
lest
the
other
boy
should
be
found
in
the
spinney
along
afore
me
said
big
george
with
much
savageness
if
you
tries
to
bolt
blow
your
brains
out
and
nail
you
to
a
along
the
the
little
earl
looked
at
him
with
eyes
of
scorn
and
horror
dare
you
touch
bird
dare
i
what
you
little
saucy
blackguard
thundered
big
george
and
fetched
him
a
great
box
on
the
ears
which
made
bertie
stagger
are
a
very
bad
man
he
said
breathlessly
are
a
very
mean
man
you
are
big
and
so
you
are
cruel
that
is
very
mean
the
gift
of
the
gab
little
devil
of
a
radley
said
the
keeper
wrathfully
pipe
another
tune
when
you
feel
the
birch
and
pick
bertie
set
his
teeth
tight
to
keep
his
words
in
he
walked
on
mute
stole
some
little
togs
as
well
as
my
pheasant
said
big
george
surveying
him
you
steal
a
pair
of
boots
when
you
was
about
it
bertie
was
still
mute
will
not
say
anything
to
this
bad
man
he
thought
else
he
will
find
out
that
it
was
not
the
sun
had
set
by
this
time
leaving
only
a
silvery
light
above
the
sea
and
the
downs
the
pale
long
twilight
of
an
english
day
had
come
upon
the
earth
bertie
was
very
white
and
his
heart
beat
fast
and
he
was
growing
very
hungry
but
he
managed
to
stumble
on
though
very
painfully
for
his
courage
would
not
let
him
repine
before
this
savage
man
who
was
mixed
up
in
his
mind
with
bluebeard
and
thor
and
croquemitaine
and
richard
and
nero
and
all
the
ogres
that
he
had
ever
met
with
in
his
reading
and
who
seemed
to
grow
larger
and
larger
and
larger
as
the
sky
and
earth
grew
darker
happily
for
his
shoeless
feet
the
way
lay
all
over
and
mossy
paths
but
he
limped
so
that
the
keeper
swore
at
him
many
times
and
the
little
earl
felt
the
desperate
resignation
of
the
martyr
at
last
they
came
in
sight
of
the
cottage
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
preserves
thatched
and
gabled
little
building
with
a
light
glimmering
in
its
lattice
window
at
the
sound
of
big
heavy
tread
a
woman
and
some
children
ran
out
mercy
george
cried
the
wife
scarecrow
have
you
been
and
got
radley
boy
growled
george
of
the
cussed
radley
boys
at
last
a
pheasant
snared
took
in
his
very
hand
mean
it
cried
his
wife
and
the
small
children
yelled
and
jumped
be
done
with
him
dad
cried
the
eldest
of
them
put
him
in
said
big
george
up
go
afore
sir
henry
fust
thing
clear
off
young
uns
and
let
me
run
him
bertie
looked
up
in
big
face
had
nothing
to
do
with
killing
the
bird
he
said
in
a
firm
though
a
faint
voice
quite
mistake
i
am
lord
your
pipe
or
choke
yer
swore
big
george
enraged
by
what
he
termed
the
of
a
radley
boy
and
without
more
ado
he
laid
hold
of
the
little
collar
and
lifted
him
into
the
the
door
of
which
was
held
open
eagerly
by
his
eldest
girl
there
was
a
great
flapping
of
wings
screeching
of
hens
and
piping
of
chicks
at
the
interruption
where
all
the
inmates
were
gone
to
roost
and
one
cock
set
up
his
usual
salutation
to
the
dawn
better
nor
sleep
night
said
big
george
as
he
tumbled
bertie
on
to
a
truss
of
straw
that
lay
there
when
he
went
out
himself
slammed
the
door
and
both
locked
and
barred
it
on
the
outside
bertie
fell
back
on
the
straw
sobbing
bitterly
his
feet
were
cut
and
bleeding
his
whole
body
ached
like
one
great
bruise
and
he
was
sick
and
faint
with
hunger
the
world
be
as
difficult
as
this
to
live
in
he
thought
ever
do
some
people
manage
to
live
almost
to
a
hundred
years
in
it
and
to
his
little
soul
the
prospect
of
a
long
life
seemed
so
horrible
that
he
sobbed
again
at
the
very
thought
of
it
it
was
quite
dark
in
the
the
rustling
and
fluttering
of
the
poultry
all
around
sounded
mysterious
and
unearthly
the
strong
unpleasant
smell
made
him
faint
and
the
pain
in
his
feet
grew
greater
every
moment
he
did
not
scream
or
go
into
convulsions
he
was
a
brave
little
man
and
proud
but
he
felt
as
if
the
long
lonely
night
there
would
kill
him
half
an
hour
perhaps
had
gone
by
when
a
voice
at
the
little
square
window
said
softly
is
bread
and
water
for
you
poor
boy
and
put
some
milk
and
cheese
too
only
my
man
know
bertie
with
great
effort
raised
himself
and
took
what
was
pushed
through
the
tiny
window
a
mug
of
milk
being
lowered
to
him
last
by
a
large
red
fat
hand
on
which
the
light
of
a
candle
held
without
was
glowing
very
much
said
the
little
earl
feebly
madam
i
did
not
kill
that
bird
and
indeed
i
am
lord
the
good
woman
went
within
to
her
lord
and
said
timidly
to
him
are
you
sartin
sure
that
a
radley
boy
he
do
look
and
speak
like
a
little
gemman
and
he
do
say
as
how
he
is
big
george
called
her
bad
names
barefoot
gemman
he
said
with
a
sneer
fool
vic
radley
as
have
been
in
our
woods
a
hundred
times
if
wunce
though
never
could
i
slap
eyes
on
him
quick
enough
to
pin
illustration
he
shared
it
willingly
the
good
housewife
took
up
her
and
said
no
more
big
arguments
were
sometimes
enforced
with
the
fist
and
even
with
the
pewter
pot
or
the
poker
meanwhile
the
little
earl
in
the
was
so
hungry
that
he
drank
the
milk
and
ate
the
bread
and
cheese
both
were
harder
and
rougher
things
than
any
he
had
ever
tasted
but
he
had
now
that
hunger
which
had
made
the
boy
on
the
stile
relish
the
turnip
and
besides
another
incident
had
occurred
to
give
him
relish
for
the
food
at
the
moment
when
he
had
sat
down
to
drink
the
milk
there
had
tumbled
out
from
behind
the
straw
a
round
object
unsteady
on
its
legs
and
having
a
very
broad
nose
and
a
very
woolly
coat
the
moon
had
risen
by
this
time
and
was
shining
in
through
the
little
square
window
and
by
its
beams
bertie
could
see
this
thing
was
a
puppy
newfoundland
puppy
some
four
months
old
he
welcomed
it
with
as
much
rapture
as
ever
robert
bruce
did
the
spider
it
had
evidently
been
awakened
from
its
sleep
by
the
smell
of
the
food
it
was
a
pleasant
companionable
warm
and
kindly
creature
it
knocked
the
bread
out
of
his
hand
and
thrust
its
square
mouth
into
his
milk
but
he
shared
it
willingly
and
had
a
hearty
cry
over
it
that
did
him
good
he
did
not
feel
all
alone
now
that
this
blundering
toppling
shapeless
amiable
had
found
its
way
to
him
he
caressed
it
in
his
arms
and
kissed
it
a
great
many
times
and
it
responded
much
more
gratefully
than
the
human
baby
had
done
in
jim
cottage
and
finally
despite
his
bleeding
feet
and
his
tired
limbs
he
fell
asleep
with
his
face
against
the
woolly
body
when
he
awoke
he
could
not
remember
what
had
happened
he
called
for
deborah
but
no
deborah
was
there
the
moon
now
full
was
shining
still
through
the
queer
little
dusky
place
the
figures
of
the
fowls
rolled
up
in
balls
of
feathers
and
stuck
upon
one
leg
were
all
that
met
his
straining
eyes
he
pulled
the
puppy
closer
and
closer
to
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
felt
really
frightened
never
touched
the
pheasant
he
cried
as
loud
as
he
could
am
lord
avillion
you
have
no
right
to
keep
me
here
let
me
out
let
me
out
let
me
out
the
fowls
woke
up
and
then
cried
and
cackled
and
crowed
and
the
poor
pup
whined
and
yelped
dolefully
but
he
got
no
other
answer
everybody
in
big
cottage
was
asleep
except
big
george
himself
who
with
his
revolver
his
and
a
couple
of
was
gone
out
again
into
the
woods
at
home
bertie
in
his
pretty
bed
that
had
belonged
to
the
little
roi
de
rome
had
always
had
a
soft
light
burning
in
a
porcelain
shade
and
his
nurse
within
easy
call
and
ralph
on
the
mat
by
the
door
he
had
never
been
in
the
dark
before
and
he
could
hear
unseen
things
moving
and
rustling
in
the
straw
and
he
felt
afraid
of
the
white
moonbeams
shifting
hither
and
thither
and
shining
on
the
shape
of
the
big
brahma
cock
till
the
great
bird
looked
like
a
vulture
once
a
rat
ran
swiftly
across
and
then
the
fowls
shrieked
and
bertie
could
not
help
screaming
with
them
but
in
a
minute
or
two
he
felt
ashamed
of
himself
for
he
thought
rat
is
creature
as
much
as
i
am
and
as
i
have
not
done
anything
wrong
i
do
not
think
they
will
be
allowed
to
hurt
nevertheless
the
night
was
very
terrible
without
the
presence
of
the
puppy
no
doubt
the
little
earl
would
have
frightened
himself
into
convulsions
and
delirium
but
the
pup
was
so
comforting
to
him
so
natural
so
positively
a
thing
real
and
in
no
wise
of
the
outer
world
that
bertie
kept
down
though
with
many
a
sob
the
panics
of
unreasoning
terror
which
assailed
him
as
the
moon
sailed
away
past
the
square
and
a
great
darkness
seemed
to
wrap
him
up
in
it
as
though
some
giant
were
stifling
him
in
a
magic
cloak
the
pup
had
not
long
been
taken
from
its
mother
and
had
been
teased
all
day
by
the
children
and
was
frightened
and
whimpered
a
good
deal
and
cuddled
itself
close
to
the
little
earl
who
hugged
it
and
kissed
it
in
paroxysms
of
loneliness
and
longing
for
comfort
with
these
long
horrible
black
hours
all
sorts
of
notions
and
terrors
assailed
him
all
he
had
ever
read
of
dungeons
of
enchanted
castles
of
entrapped
princes
of
prince
arthur
and
the
duke
of
rothsay
of
the
prisoner
of
chillon
and
the
iron
mask
of
every
kind
of
hero
martyr
and
captive
crowded
into
his
mind
with
horrifying
clearness
thronging
on
him
with
a
host
of
fearful
images
and
memories
but
this
was
only
in
his
weaker
moments
when
he
clasped
the
puppy
and
felt
its
warm
wet
tongue
lick
his
hair
he
gathered
up
his
courage
after
all
he
thought
big
george
was
certainly
only
a
keeper
an
ogre
or
an
astrologer
or
a
tyrant
of
athens
or
of
rome
so
he
fell
off
again
after
a
long
and
dreadful
into
a
fitful
slumber
in
which
his
feet
ached
and
his
nerves
jumped
and
the
frightful
visions
assailed
him
just
as
much
as
when
he
was
awake
and
how
that
ghastly
night
passed
by
him
he
never
knew
very
well
when
he
again
opened
his
eyes
there
was
a
dim
gray
light
in
the
and
sharp
in
his
ear
was
ringing
the
of
the
brahma
chanticleer
it
was
daybreak
a
round
red
face
looked
in
at
the
square
hole
and
the
voice
of
the
wife
said
gemman
big
george
will
be
arter
ye
come
eight
and
go
hard
yer
say
now
yer
snare
the
bird
said
bertie
languidly
lying
full
length
on
the
straw
he
felt
shivery
and
chilly
and
very
stiff
and
very
miserable
in
all
ways
yer
know
who
did
persisted
the
woman
jist
you
tell
me
and
make
it
all
square
with
george
and
let
you
out
and
gie
ye
porridge
and
take
ye
home
on
the
the
little
earl
was
silent
drat
ye
for
a
obstinate
i
abide
a
obstinate
said
the
woman
angrily
did
snare
the
bird
jist
say
that
all
and
mighty
will
not
say
that
said
bertie
and
the
woman
slammed
a
wooden
door
that
there
was
to
the
and
told
him
he
was
a
mule
and
a
pig
and
that
she
was
not
going
to
waste
any
more
words
about
him
she
should
let
the
birds
out
by
the
bars
what
she
called
the
bars
which
were
two
movable
lengths
of
wood
at
the
bottom
of
one
of
the
walls
did
in
point
of
fact
soon
slip
aside
and
the
fowls
all
cackled
and
strutted
and
fluttered
after
their
different
manners
and
bustled
through
the
opening
towards
the
daylight
and
the
scattered
corn
the
brahma
cock
having
much
ado
to
squeeze
his
plumage
where
his
wives
had
passed
hungry
said
bertie
timidly
the
puppy
said
the
woman
outside
and
no
more
compassion
was
wrung
out
of
her
the
little
earl
felt
very
languid
and
strange
he
was
faint
and
a
little
feverish
dear
pup
what
a
night
he
murmured
with
a
burst
of
sobbing
yet
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
purchase
his
liberty
by
giving
up
little
guilty
dan
some
more
hours
rolled
on
empty
desolate
with
the
whine
of
the
pup
for
its
mother
and
the
chirping
of
unseen
martins
going
in
and
out
of
the
roof
suppose
they
mean
to
starve
me
to
death
thought
bertie
his
thoughts
clinging
to
the
duke
of
story
he
heard
the
tread
of
big
george
on
the
ground
outside
and
his
deep
voice
cursing
and
swearing
and
the
children
running
to
and
fro
and
the
hens
cackling
then
the
little
earl
remembered
that
he
was
born
of
brave
men
and
must
not
be
unworthy
of
them
and
he
rose
though
unsteadily
and
tried
to
pull
his
disordered
dress
together
and
tried
too
not
to
look
afraid
he
recalled
casabianca
on
the
burning
ship
casabianca
had
not
been
so
very
much
older
than
he
the
door
was
thrust
open
violently
and
that
big
grim
black
man
looked
in
varmint
he
cried
out
out
and
get
your
merits
birch
and
and
for
a
good
month
go
bail
and
be
a
year
if
i
wur
the
then
bertie
on
his
little
shaky
shivering
limbs
walked
quite
haughtily
towards
him
and
the
open
air
the
puppy
waddling
after
him
should
not
be
so
very
rough
and
rude
he
said
will
go
with
you
but
the
puppy
wants
some
big
only
answer
was
to
clutch
wildly
at
clothes
and
hurl
him
anyhow
head
first
into
a
little
that
stood
ready
tarnation
cheek
i
never
seed
he
swore
all
them
radley
imps
are
as
like
one
to
other
as
so
many
the
gift
the
gab
and
bertie
lying
very
sick
and
dizzy
in
the
bottom
of
the
cart
managed
to
find
breath
to
call
out
to
the
woman
on
the
do
give
the
puppy
something
it
has
been
so
hungry
all
no
radley
boy
said
the
wife
to
her
eldest
girl
as
the
cart
drove
away
a
little
gemman
thought
of
the
pup
strikes
me
lass
your
put
a
rod
in
pickle
for
hisself
along
his
tantrums
and
it
was
but
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
cottage
to
the
mansion
of
the
sir
henry
who
was
owner
of
these
lands
and
the
pony
spun
along
at
a
swing
trot
and
big
george
smoking
and
rattling
along
never
deigned
to
look
at
his
prisoner
boy
mason
said
the
woman
who
opened
the
lodge
gates
and
big
george
answered
heartily
ay
a
radley
imp
caught
at
last
got
the
bird
on
him
and
the
gin
too
what
call
that
call
it
like
your
vigilance
mason
said
the
lawks
he
do
look
a
mite
big
george
spun
on
up
the
avenue
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
knew
his
own
important
place
in
the
world
and
the
little
cart
was
soon
pulled
up
at
the
steps
of
a
stately
building
sir
henry
to
wunce
case
said
big
george
to
the
footman
lounging
about
the
doorway
course
mason
sir
henry
said
as
you
was
to
go
to
him
this
way
said
one
of
the
men
and
big
george
proceeded
to
haul
bertie
out
of
the
cart
as
unceremoniously
as
he
had
thrown
him
in
but
the
little
earl
although
his
head
spun
and
his
shoeless
feet
ached
managed
to
get
down
himself
and
staggered
across
the
hall
radley
boy
said
big
george
displaying
him
with
much
pride
the
spring
and
all
the
winter
been
after
that
varmint
and
now
henry
waits
said
a
functionary
and
big
george
marched
into
a
handsome
library
dragging
his
captive
behind
him
towards
the
central
at
which
a
elderly
gentleman
was
sitting
arrived
before
his
master
the
demeanor
of
big
george
underwent
a
remarkable
change
he
cringed
and
he
pulled
his
lock
of
hair
and
he
scraped
about
with
his
leg
in
the
humblest
manner
possible
and
proceeded
to
lay
the
dead
pheasant
and
the
trap
and
gear
upon
the
table
him
in
the
sir
henry
he
said
with
triumph
piercing
through
deference
been
after
him
ages
a
radley
boy
the
little
been
and
and
all
the
winter
long
and
here
got
is
very
small
a
child
said
sir
henry
doubtingly
trying
to
see
the
culprit
stunted
in
his
growth
along
wickedness
sir
said
big
george
very
positively
old
in
wice
what
he
is
sir
in
at
that
moment
bertie
managed
to
get
in
front
of
him
and
lifted
his
little
faint
voice
has
made
a
mistake
he
said
feebly
never
killed
your
birds
at
all
and
i
am
lord
heavens
you
thundering
idiot
shouted
sir
henry
springing
to
his
feet
is
the
little
earl
they
are
looking
for
all
over
the
island
and
all
over
the
country
my
dear
little
fellow
how
can
i
his
apologies
were
cut
short
by
bertie
dropping
down
in
a
dead
faint
at
his
feet
so
weak
was
he
from
cold
and
hunger
and
exhaustion
and
unwonted
exposure
it
was
not
very
long
however
before
all
the
alarmed
household
pouring
in
at
the
furious
ringing
of
their
bell
had
revived
the
little
earl
and
brought
him
to
his
senses
none
the
worse
for
the
momentary
eclipse
of
them
do
not
be
angry
with
your
man
murmured
bertie
as
he
lay
on
one
of
the
wide
leathern
couches
meant
to
do
his
duty
and
you
let
me
buy
the
puppy
of
course
sir
henry
would
not
allow
the
little
earl
to
wander
any
farther
afield
and
of
course
a
horseman
was
sent
over
in
hot
haste
to
apprise
his
people
misled
by
the
who
frightened
at
his
own
share
in
the
little
escape
had
sworn
till
he
was
hoarse
that
he
had
seen
lord
avillion
take
a
boat
for
rye
so
liberty
was
nipped
in
the
bud
and
very
sorrowfully
and
wistfully
he
strayed
out
on
to
the
of
sir
house
awaiting
the
coming
of
his
friends
the
puppy
had
been
fetched
and
was
tumbling
and
waddling
solemnly
beside
him
yet
he
was
very
sad
at
heart
are
you
thinking
of
my
child
said
sir
henry
who
was
a
gentle
and
learned
man
mouth
quivered
see
he
said
hesitatingly
see
am
nothing
it
is
the
title
they
give
me
and
the
money
i
have
got
that
make
the
people
so
good
to
me
when
i
am
only
you
see
how
it
and
the
tears
rolled
down
his
face
which
he
had
heard
called
and
and
likened
to
tallow
dear
little
fellow
said
his
companion
tenderly
comes
a
day
when
even
kings
are
stripped
of
all
their
pomp
and
lie
naked
and
stark
it
is
then
that
which
they
have
done
not
that
which
they
have
been
that
will
find
them
grace
and
let
them
rise
i
am
nothing
said
bertie
piteously
see
when
the
people
do
not
know
who
i
am
they
think
me
nothing
at
fancy
peggy
and
dan
will
think
so
when
we
tell
them
everything
said
the
host
are
all
of
us
nothing
in
ourselves
my
child
only
here
and
there
we
pluck
a
bit
of
lavender
is
we
do
some
good
thing
or
say
some
kind
word
then
we
get
a
sweet
savor
from
it
you
will
gather
a
great
deal
of
lavender
in
your
life
or
i
am
will
try
said
bertie
who
understood
so
off
the
downs
that
day
and
in
the
pleasant
hawthorn
woods
of
the
friendly
little
isle
he
plucked
two
heads
of
lavender
and
sympathy
believe
me
they
are
worth
as
much
as
was

moly

ulysses
