oh

by
craning
his
neck
around
the
corner
of

he
noted
with
increasing
astonishment
that
the
rivulet
sprang
from
the
black
ferule
of
an
umbrella
excuse
me
miss
kjelland
he
said
but
this
is
not
a
picnic
it
is
a
clinic
as
coolly
as
if
she
had
been
appraising
a
new
dog
or
pussy
tome
gallien
narrowed
her
eyes
to
both
the
vision
and
the
announcement
the
stingy
receiver
i
if
i
were
fifty
years
old
said
the
young
doctor
quite
bluntly
and
found
myself
suddenly
stripped
of
practically
all
my
motor
powers
except
my
pocketbook
and
my
sense
of
humor
and
was
told
that
i
could
make
one
wish
but
i
am
fifty
years
old
admitted
the
sick
woman
and
i
do
find
myself
stripped
of
practically
all
my
motor
powers
except
my
pocketbook
and
my
sense
of
humor
then
for
heaven
sake
wish
snapped
the
young
doctor
oh
my
goodness
mocked
the
sick
woman
you
not
by
any
chance
a
a
fairy
are
you
fairy
bristled
the
young
man
the
phrase
is
an
unfamiliar
one
to
me
he
confided
with
some
hauteur
quizzically
then
for
a
moment
among
her
hotel
pillows
the
woman
lay
staring
out
through
the
open
window
into
the
indefinite
vista
of
beyond
and
beyond
and
beyond
then
so
furtively
that
the
whites
of
her
eyes
showed
suddenly
like
a
snarling
dog
she
glanced
back
at
the
young
doctor
grimly
inscrutable
face
you
quite
sure
that
it
is
a
will
you
want
me
to
make
not
a
wish
she
asked
quite
sure
said
the
young
doctor
without
emotion
as
two
antagonists
searching
desperately
for
some
weak
spot
in
each
other
mental
armor
the
patient
eyes
narrowed
to
the
doctor
the
doctor
to
the
patient
it
was
the
patient
who
fled
first
from
the
probe
how
many
years
can
you
give
me
she
surrendered
dully
i
ca
give
you
any
i
ca
afford
it
slapped
the
young
brisk
cool
voice
how
many
years
can
you
sell
me
then
roused
the
woman
with
the
first
faint
red
flare
of
vigor
across
her
cheek
bones
oh
i
do
know
admitted
the
young
doctor
sagging
back
a
little
wearily
against
the
edge
of
the
bureau
with
his
long
arms
folded
loosely
across
his
breast
he
stood
staring
tensely
down
through
the
woman
question
into
the
actual
case
itself
oh
i
know
he
admitted
oh
of
course
if
you
had
some
one
interest
to
revitalize
you
if
the
matter
of
congenial
climate
could
be
properly
adjusted
with
all
your
abundant
financial
resources
and
all
the
extra
serenities
and
safeguards
that
financial
resources
can
wrap
a
sick
person
in
oh
i
suppose
one
could
almost
positively
guarantee
you
guarantee
you
oh
years
and
years
he
finished
a
trifle
vaguely
only
that
winced
the
woman
years
and
years
she
quoted
mockingly
it
is
enough
not
nearly
enough
she
flared
with
sudden
passion
even
so
smiled
the
young
doctor
that
is
a
more
definite
estimate
than
i
could
equally
honestly
make
for
the
youngest
friskiest
child
who
prances
to
work
or
play
every
day
through
the
tortuous
traffic
of
our
city
streets
oh
said
the
woman
with
a
flicker
of
humor
in
her
tears
oh
smiled
the
doctor
without
an
atom
of
humor
in
the
smile
with
her
handsome
gray
head
cocked
ever
so
slightly
to
one
side
the
woman
eyes
seemed
rather
oddly
intent
on
the
young
doctor
for
an
instant
how
how
thin
you
are
and
how
she
commented
suddenly
with
quite
irrelevant
impudence
thank
you
bowed
the
young
doctor
ha
chuckled
the
woman
and
i
she
is
is
that
what
you
like
to
say
you
are
perfectly
welcome
to
look
any
way
you
wish
said
the
young
doctor
with
distinct
coldness
indifferently
then
for
a
moment
both
doctor
and
patient
seemed
to
relax
into
the
centric
personal
hush
of
the
itself
with
its
far
outlying
murmur
of
thudding
feet
its
occasional
sharp
click
of
remote
elevator
machinery
then
the
doctor
snatched
out
his
watch
well
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
do
first
roused
the
sick
woman
instantly
make
your
wish
said
the
doctor
yes
i
know
parried
the
woman
but
what
do
you
want
me
to
wish
what
kind
of
a
wish
i
mean
do
you
want
me
to
make
as
though
personally
affronted
by
the
question
the
young
doctor
stepped
suddenly
forward
what
kind
of
a
wish
do
i
want
you
to
make
he
demanded
why
what
kind
of
a
wish
should
i
want
you
to
make
except
an
honest
wish
not
the
sanctimonious
reconsidered
sort
of
wish
that
you
think
you
ought
to
make
but
the
first
glad
whim
that
gushes
up
into
your
mind
when
anybody
springs
the
word
at
you
oh
brightened
the
woman
that
ought
to
be
easy
enough
the
sudden
smile
flooding
into
the
very
faintly
distorted
facial
muscles
gave
a
certain
shrewd
waggish
sort
of
humor
to
the
assertion
why
not
she
persisted
speculatively
long
life
and
happiness
having
been
logically
eliminated
from
my
impulses
and
both
faith
and
fact
having
reasonably
convinced
me
that
all
my
loved
ones
are
perfectly
well
provided
for
in
either
this
world
or
the
next
why
should
i
wish
for
the
one
thing
that
will
add
most
to
my
own
personal
diversion
oh
very
well
she
began
to
consider
whitely
her
eyelids
drooped
down
across
her
turbid
eyes
now
you
count
ten
doctor
she
murmured
quite
casually
and
when
you
say
ten
i
tell
you
the
wish
this
is
a
game
mrs
gallien
bristled
the
young
doctor
very
languidly
the
woman
opened
her
eyes
wide
oh
is
it
she
asked
then
i
wo
wish
thank
you
what
are
you
talking
about
scolded
the
young
doctor
about
getting
well
conceded
the
woman
languidly
the
white
eyelids
closed
again
and
if
getting
well
is
a
game
i
wo
get
well
either
affirmed
the
woman
with
a
gasp
of
irritation
the
young
doctor
snatched
up
his
hat
and
left
the
room
but
outside
the
door
neither
up
the
hall
nor
down
the
hall
nor
across
the
hall
was
the
nurse
waiting
where
he
had
told
her
to
wait
illustration
oh
drat
you
women
he
grinned
sheepishly
well
go
ahead
with
an
audible
imprecation
he
stalked
back
into
the
and
threw
himself
down
into
the
first
chair
he
could
reach
oh
drat
you
women
he
grinned
sheepishly
well
go
ahead
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
nine
ten
as
automatically
almost
as
a
mechanical
doll
the
sick
woman
opened
her
eyes
oh
all
right
she
smiled
now
i
will
tell
you
the
wish
but
first
i
must
tell
you
that
the
thing
i
hate
most
in
the
world
is
an
empty
twilight
and
the
thing
i
love
best
is
a
crowded
shop
oh
the
joy
of
shopping
she
quickened
the
fun
the
fury
of
it
buy
buy
buy
while
the
light
lasts
and
the
money
shines
but
as
for
the
empty
twilight
she
wilted
again
i
wish
her
voice
caught
suddenly
i
wish
that
the
last
mail
of
the
day
may
never
leave
me
utterly
letterless
and
that
i
may
always
be
expecting
a
package
by
express
do
you
really
mean
it
asked
the
young
doctor
without
the
slightest
trace
of
perturbance
why
of
course
i
mean
it
smiled
the
woman
but
do
you
dream
for
a
moment
that
you
can
guarantee
that
i
can
at
least
prescribe
it
said
the
young
doctor
you
have
more
subtlety
than
i
thought
drawled
the
woman
you
have
more
simplicity
than
i
had
dared
to
hope
bowed
the
young
doctor
again
in
shrewd
appraisement
the
two
measured
each
other
then
with
a
great
busy
frown
the
young
doctor
turned
to
his
notebook
let
me
see
he
estimated
it
was
four
weeks
ago
yesterday
that
you
fell
on
the
street
was
it
said
the
woman
indifferently
gallien
asked
the
young
doctor
with
some
abruptness
just
exactly
where
is
your
home
i
have
no
home
said
the
woman
yes
but
you
must
live
somewhere
bristled
the
young
doctor
only
in
my
pocketbook
and
my
sense
of
humor
quoted
the
woman
with
frank
mockery
but
why
make
such
a
mystery
about
your
domicile
persisted
the
young
doctor
that
just
it
said
the
woman
i
have
any
domicile
to
make
a
mystery
of
it
seventeen
years
since
i
lived
in
what
you
call
a
domicile
where
have
you
lived
demanded
the
young
doctor
oh
on
steamers
mostly
conceded
the
woman
very
faintly
the
pallid
nostrils
dilated
i
been
to
australia
five
times
she
acknowledged
and
china
twice
and
japan
she
quickened
all
the
little
vague
outlying
islands
all
the
great
jostling
eager
seaports
by
steam
by
paddle
wheels
by
lax
sails
in
sudden
listlessness
she
turned
her
cheek
to
the
pillow
again
wherever
the
sea
is
salt
she
murmured
wherever
the
sea
is
salt
hunting
always
and
forever
hunting
yes
that
it
always
and
forever
hunting
for
lights
and
laughter
and
pardon
me
said
the
young
doctor
quite
abruptly
but
is
your
husband
living
no
said
the
woman
he
died
two
years
ago
inquisitively
for
a
moment
the
young
doctor
studied
the
face
before
him
pardon
me
he
stammered
but
but
was
it
a
great
shock
to
you
it
was
a
great
relief
said
the
woman
without
emotion
he
had
been
hopelessly
insane
for
seventeen
years
oh
jumped
the
young
doctor
as
though
the
thought
fairly
tortured
his
senses
oh
speculated
the
woman
quizzically
with
the
merciful
outer
callousness
which
the
brain
provides
for
those
who
are
obliged
to
carry
some
one
scorching
thought
for
an
indeterminate
period
of
years
as
though
in
sheer
nervous
outlet
the
young
doctor
began
almost
at
once
to
pace
the
room
seeing
that
there
are
no
no
personal
ties
apparently
to
hold
you
here
or
drive
you
there
he
said
the
matter
of
congenial
climate
ought
to
be
one
that
we
can
easily
arrange
with
half
ironic
amusement
the
sick
woman
lay
and
watched
his
worried
fluctuating
face
the
question
of
climate
is
all
arranged
she
said
the
speed
that
was
stripped
from
my
body
last
week
has
at
least
been
put
back
into
my
brain
just
where
i
am
going
just
whom
i
am
going
to
take
with
me
just
what
i
am
going
to
do
to
amuse
me
every
last
infinitesimal
detail
of
all
the
rest
of
my
life
she
smiled
i
have
planned
it
all
out
while
you
have
been
dawdling
there
between
the
wardrobe
and
the
bureau
dawdling
snapped
the
young
doctor
quite
abruptly
he
stopped
his
nervous
pacing
well
where
is
it
that
you
want
to
go
he
asked
musingly
the
woman
eyes
stared
off
again
into
the
vista
of
the
city
roofs
on
an
island
she
said
off
the
coast
of
south
carolina
there
is
a
house
it
is
really
rather
a
dreadful
old
place
i
have
not
seen
it
since
i
was
a
girl
it
was
old
then
it
must
be
almost
a
wreck
now
and
the
island
is
not
very
large
and
there
is
no
other
house
on
the
island
just
this
great
rambling
deserted
shack
and
six
battered
old
trees
half
strangled
with
dangly
gray
moss
and
there
are
blue
jays
always
in
the
gray
moss
and
cardinal
birds
and
unestimable
squirrels
and
there
is
a
bedroom
in
the
house
forty
feet
long
and
in
that
bedroom
there
is
a
seven
feet
wide
and
most
weirdly
devised
of
old
ships
figureheads
a
smirking
faded
siren
at
one
corner
a
sailor
at
another
i
forget
the
others
but
altogether
in
memory
i
see
it
as
a
rather
unusually
broad
and
amusing
shelf
to
be
laid
aside
on
and
there
in
the
middle
of
that
great
bed
in
the
middle
of
that
great
dingy
sort
of
room
with
its
every
ancient
windowpane
blearing
grayly
into
the
sea
through
porches
so
broad
so
dark
so
glowering
that
no
streak
of
cloud
or
sky
will
ever
reach
my
eyes
again
nor
any
strip
of
earth
i
shall
lie
i
say
in
unutterable
peace
and
tranquillity
as
other
ghosts
have
lain
before
me
fathoms
deep
below
all
their
troubles
and
always
as
i
lie
thus
there
will
be
the
sigh
of
the
surf
in
my
ears
and
the
swell
of
the
tide
in
my
eyes
eternally
across
my
windows
wings
shall
soar
and
pass
and
gray
mosses
float
and
flare
cheerful
snapped
the
young
doctor
yes
is
it
beamed
the
woman
with
a
gasp
of
surprise
the
young
doctor
turned
and
stared
at
her
why
i
really
believe
that
you
think
so
he
stammered
why
of
course
i
think
so
said
the
woman
why
not
she
queried
a
dimming
candle
glows
brightest
in
a
dark
room
not
a
trace
of
morbidness
was
in
her
voice
not
a
flicker
of
sentimentality
and
besides
she
smiled
it
is
also
my
desire
to
remove
myself
as
far
as
possible
from
the
main
thoroughfares
of
life
i
do
see
why
protested
the
young
doctor
this
is
the
said
the
woman
just
as
i
fell
that
day
she
smiled
in
my
last
conscious
moment
i
mean
a
hurrying
child
stumbled
and
stepped
on
me
once
again
the
smile
twisted
ever
so
slightly
to
one
side
and
never
any
more
while
i
live
said
the
woman
do
i
care
to
repeat
the
sensation
of
being
an
impediment
to
traffic
very
idly
for
a
moment
she
seemed
to
focus
her
entire
interest
on
the
flapping
window
curtain
and
i
shall
name
my
house
name
my
house
she
mused
with
sudden
impetuous
conviction
every
lax
muscle
of
her
face
tightened
into
action
once
once
in
new
england
she
hurried
i
saw
a
tulip
named
of
the
garden
for
absolute
antithesis
i
shall
call
my
house
of
the
sea
do
you
wish
to
take
your
present
young
nurse
with
you
asked
the
doctor
a
bit
abruptly
the
crooked
smile
on
the
woman
face
straightened
instantly
into
positiveness
i
do
not
said
the
woman
i
detest
novices
their
professional
affectations
drive
me
mad
i
am
born
weaned
educated
courted
married
widowed
crippled
in
the
moppish
time
it
takes
them
to
wash
my
face
to
straighten
the
simplest
fork
on
my
breakfast
tray
every
gesture
of
their
bodies
every
impulse
of
their
minds
fairly
creak
with
the
laborious
studied
arrogance
of
an
immature
nature
thrust
suddenly
into
authority
if
i
got
to
have
personal
service
all
the
rest
of
my
days
for
goodness
sake
give
me
a
big
experienced
nature
reduced
by
some
untoward
reason
to
the
utmost
terms
of
simplicity
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
the
irritation
vanished
from
her
face
there
is
a
chambermaid
here
in
this
hotel
i
love
her
said
the
woman
she
was
a
hospital
superintendent
somewhere
once
until
her
deafness
smashed
it
as
ingenuously
as
a
child
the
tired
eyes
lifted
to
the
young
face
i
like
deaf
people
said
the
woman
they
never
chatter
i
have
noticed
nor
insist
upon
reading
the
newspapers
to
you
being
themselves
protected
from
every
vocal
noise
that
does
not
directly
concern
them
they
seem
instinctively
to
accord
you
the
same
sacristy
and
besides
smiled
the
woman
this
hair
is
as
gray
as
mine
and
i
adore
women
whose
hair
is
just
exactly
as
gray
as
mine
and
also
smiled
the
woman
her
name
happens
to
be
and
i
have
always
craved
the
personal
devotion
of
someone
named
and
i
shall
pay
her
an
extra
hundred
dollars
a
month
smiled
the
woman
to
call
me
never
in
my
life
said
the
woman
have
i
ever
had
any
food
cooked
for
my
first
name
martha
will
do
everything
for
me
you
understand
she
added
quickly
yes
but
how
do
you
know
that
she
go
with
you
asked
the
young
doctor
dryly
how
do
i
know
that
she
go
with
me
flared
the
woman
the
imperious
consciousness
of
money
was
in
the
flare
but
also
the
subtler
surety
of
a
temperamental
conviction
why
of
course
she
go
said
the
woman
as
definitely
as
though
she
had
assumed
that
sunshine
would
be
sunshine
she
dismissed
the
whole
topic
from
their
conversation
oh
all
right
smiled
the
young
doctor
a
bit
ironically
i
am
to
infer
then
that
climate
locality
care
companionship
everything
has
been
arranged
except
your
wish
for
a
chronic
package
by
express
oh
that
is
all
arranged
too
boasted
the
woman
i
do
see
it
said
the
young
doctor
i
saw
it
said
the
woman
while
you
were
straightening
your
necktie
oh
of
course
the
shops
can
never
happen
again
she
winced
with
real
emotion
all
the
gay
covetous
fingering
of
silk
or
bronze
the
shrewd
explorative
sallies
through
aisles
of
treasure
and
tiers
of
tantalization
but
just
the
package
part
she
rallied
instantly
oh
the
package
part
i
assure
you
is
perfectly
easy
as
long
as
memory
lasts
and
imagination
holds
with
a
check
book
on
one
side
of
me
and
a
few
dollars
worth
of
postage
stamps
on
the
other
all
i
have
to
do
she
laughed
is
just
to
lie
there
on
my
back
and
study
the
advertising
pages
of
all
the
magazines
every
fascinating
gown
that
cries
for
help
from
a
fashion
catalogue
every
irresistible
lawn
mower
that
brags
of
its
prowess
from
the
columns
of
an
agricultural
journal
ten
cent
packages
of
floral
miracles
or
ten
dollar
lotions
from
the
beauty
shops
certainly
never
again
till
the
end
of
time
ought
there
to
dawn
a
day
when
i
have
a
reasonable
right
to
expect
that
something
will
arrive
and
i
shall
have
a
wrangle
boat
of
course
babbled
the
woman
impishly
what
is
it
oh
boat
you
call
it
oh
any
old
kind
of
an
engine
i
do
care
so
long
as
it
serves
its
purpose
of
keeping
a
man
and
a
boy
busy
all
day
long
quarreling
as
they
always
do
just
how
to
run
it
and
once
a
day
every
late
afternoon
i
shall
send
the
wrangle
boat
to
the
mainland
way
way
out
beyond
the
sky
line
of
my
piazza
and
the
instant
that
boat
swings
back
into
vision
again
just
between
the
droop
of
the
roof
and
the
lift
of
the
railing
they
will
hoist
a
flag
if
there
is
anything
for
me
and
if
there
is
if
there
is
across
her
whimsical
prophecy
indescribable
irritation
settled
suddenly
and
if
there
anything
they
need
never
return
snapped
the
woman
oh
of
course
that
all
right
at
first
mocked
the
young
doctor
but
in
your
original
description
of
your
island
i
remember
no
mention
of
large
storehouses
or
empty
warerooms
after
a
while
you
know
with
things
arriving
every
day
or
so
and
the
house
i
infer
except
for
the
one
big
room
you
speak
of
sustains
no
special
acreage
stupid
rallied
the
woman
oh
i
see
puzzled
the
young
doctor
you
you
mean
that
going
to
give
the
things
away
hordes
of
young
nieces
and
poor
relations
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
why
why
of
course
oh
no
said
the
woman
with
suddenly
narrowing
eyes
her
whole
face
turned
incalculably
shrewd
and
cold
oh
no
i
am
all
through
giving
anything
away
defiantly
for
an
instant
she
challenged
the
young
doctor
silence
then
sank
back
with
frank
indifference
into
her
pillows
again
worldly
as
i
am
she
smiled
very
faintly
and
worldly
as
my
father
and
mother
were
before
me
and
their
father
and
mother
doubtless
before
them
there
is
one
little
prayer
that
i
shall
never
forget
and
i
found
it
if
the
fact
interests
you
inscribed
painstakingly
in
faded
violet
ink
in
the
back
of
my
grandfather
first
check
book
before
evidently
either
wealth
or
worldliness
had
quite
begun
to
set
in
and
this
is
the
little
prayer
if
fortune
and
finance
should
so
ordain
that
i
may
never
be
any
kind
of
a
giver
heaven
grant
that
at
least
i
may
not
be
a
stingy
receiver
but
share
unstintedly
with
such
benefactor
as
may
favor
me
the
exceeding
happiness
which
his
benefaction
has
most
surely
conferred
upon
me
once
more
the
faint
smile
twisted
into
cynicism
that
it
said
the
woman
i
tired
of
i
i
afraid
i
do
get
you
said
the
young
doctor
do
you
ever
get
anything
snapped
the
woman
explosively
it
was
the
young
doctor
turn
to
flare
now
oh
yes
he
said
sometimes
i
get
awfully
tired
of
the
vagaries
of
women
out
of
her
nerves
rather
than
her
mirth
the
woman
burst
out
laughing
you
are
so
young
she
said
not
as
juvenile
as
your
vagaries
protested
the
young
doctor
but
my
vagaries
are
not
juvenile
insisted
the
woman
they
are
as
old
and
ingrained
as
time
itself
for
seventeen
years
quickened
the
woman
i
have
been
gifts
from
all
over
the
world
ripping
things
out
of
impersonal
wholesale
as
it
were
to
apply
them
as
best
i
might
to
this
person
or
the
other
individual
need
say
if
you
want
to
that
i
have
had
nothing
else
to
do
on
my
travels
except
to
spend
money
yet
the
fact
remains
that
as
far
as
my
own
personal
satisfactions
are
concerned
in
the
matter
of
giving
i
have
been
pouring
presents
for
seventeen
years
into
a
bottomless
pit
never
once
i
mean
smiled
the
woman
never
once
yearning
over
the
abyss
as
the
gift
went
down
have
i
ever
heard
the
entrancing
thud
that
a
gift
ought
to
make
when
it
lands
on
real
appreciation
never
well
you
are
a
cynic
conceded
the
young
doctor
i
admit
it
said
the
woman
yet
even
a
cynic
may
be
for
the
first
time
in
her
tired
sophisticated
face
shrewdness
and
irony
were
equally
routed
by
sheer
perplexity
i
thought
it
all
out
as
decently
as
i
could
from
the
other
person
point
of
view
she
puzzled
i
see
his
side
i
think
i
have
no
legal
constitutional
right
of
course
to
demand
a
person
gratitude
for
any
gift
which
is
purely
voluntary
on
my
part
lots
of
people
in
all
probability
would
infinitely
rather
not
have
a
gift
than
be
obliged
thereby
to
write
a
you
for
it
against
such
a
person
wish
and
inclination
i
mean
i
no
right
to
pry
you
out
of
him
even
with
golf
sticks
or
first
editions
i
no
right
to
be
a
highwayman
i
mean
even
if
i
literally
dying
for
a
you
i
no
more
right
i
mean
to
hold
up
a
person
with
a
gift
than
i
have
to
hold
him
up
with
a
gun
then
what
are
you
fussing
about
asked
the
young
doctor
i
fussing
about
the
hatefulness
of
it
said
the
woman
all
the
shrewdness
came
suddenly
back
to
her
face
this
is
what
i
mean
she
cried
sharply
when
i
stay
in
paris
three
months
for
instance
to
collect
a
trousseau
for
the
daughter
of
a
man
who
meant
something
to
me
once
in
my
youth
and
receive
in
due
time
from
that
girl
a
single
page
of
gothic
handwriting
thanking
me
no
matter
how
gushingly
for
my
gift
i
tell
you
i
could
fairly
kill
her
for
her
stingy
receiving
not
a
word
from
her
about
hats
you
understand
not
a
comment
on
shoes
not
the
vaguest
remotest
mention
of
chiffon
veils
silk
stockings
evening
gowns
street
suits
mink
furs
anything
just
the
whole
outfit
trunk
after
trunk
of
all
lumped
in
together
and
dismissed
perfectly
casually
under
the
lump
word
and
it
was
just
a
that
i
gave
her
you
understand
said
the
woman
with
a
sudden
real
twinge
of
emotion
almost
nobody
you
know
ever
gives
just
a
what
i
really
gave
her
of
course
was
three
whole
months
of
my
taste
time
temperament
three
whole
months
of
my
three
whole
months
of
a
woman
dreams
for
a
young
girl
what
i
really
gave
her
of
course
was
the
plaudits
of
her
elders
the
envies
of
all
her
girl
chums
the
new
unduplicatable
pride
and
dignity
of
a
consciously
perfect
equipment
what
i
really
gave
her
of
course
was
the
light
in
her
bridegroom
eyes
when
he
first
saw
her
merge
a
throb
of
mist
and
pearls
through
the
gray
gloom
of
the
cathedral
chancel
what
i
really
gave
her
of
course
was
the
yes
but
you
surely
know
that
she
appreciated
the
gift
deprecated
the
young
doctor
why
of
course
she
appreciated
the
gift
snapped
the
woman
but
what
i
trying
to
find
is
some
one
who
appreciate
the
giver
anybody
can
appreciate
a
gift
she
added
with
unprecedented
scorn
pleased
snapped
the
woman
why
of
course
she
was
pleased
the
only
thing
i
fussing
about
is
that
she
was
too
stingy
to
share
her
pleasure
with
me
the
fire
i
worked
so
hard
to
light
lit
all
right
but
simply
refused
to
warm
me
that
it
why
did
she
note
by
one
single
extra
flourish
of
her
pen
that
the
lining
of
her
opera
cloak
was
like
the
petalling
of
a
pink
killarney
rose
or
that
the
texture
of
her
traveling
suit
would
have
made
a
princess
strut
with
pride
when
she
lumped
a
dozen
paris
hats
into
the
one
word
did
she
dream
for
one
single
instant
that
she
had
lulled
my
perfectly
human
hunger
to
know
whether
it
was
the
red
one
or
the
green
one
or
the
gold
which
most
became
her
ecstatic
little
face
did
it
ever
occur
to
her
to
tell
me
what
her
lover
said
about
the
gay
little
brown
leather
hunting
suit
six
months
hence
freezing
to
death
in
some
palace
on
the
riviera
is
there
one
chance
in
ten
thousand
do
you
think
that
she
will
write
me
to
say
you
darling
how
did
you
ever
happen
to
think
of
a
moleskin
breakfast
coat
and
footies
and
again
scolded
the
woman
when
a
stodgy
old
missionary
on
his
way
back
to
africa
relaxes
enough
on
a
moonlight
night
so
that
it
fun
a
month
later
to
send
him
a
mule
and
cart
just
to
keep
his
faithful
clumsy
old
feet
off
the
african
sands
do
you
think
it
fun
for
him
to
send
me
eight
smug
laborious
pages
complimenting
me
without
a
moon
in
them
on
great
opportunities
for
doing
good
which
my
enormous
wealth
must
give
me
and
commending
me
specially
this
most
recent
account
of
my
stewardship
which
i
have
just
evidenced
in
my
noble
gift
for
one
single
illuminating
flash
humor
twitched
back
into
the
woman
eyebrow
stewardship
bosh
she
confided
on
a
picture
post
card
with
stubby
pencil
i
would
so
infinitely
rather
he
had
scribbled
for
you
old
girl
this
is
some
mule
with
a
little
sigh
of
fatigue
she
sank
back
into
her
pillows
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
quite
evidently
she
said
everywhere
it
the
same
people
love
pictures
and
never
note
who
painted
them
people
love
stories
and
never
remember
who
wrote
them
why
in
any
shop
in
this
city
she
roused
i
wager
you
could
go
in
and
present
a
hundred
dollar
bill
to
the
seediest
old
clerk
you
saw
and
go
back
in
an
hour
and
he
would
know
you
by
sight
gift
without
the
giver
is
bare
she
quoted
savagely
ha
what
they
really
meant
was
giver
added
to
the
gift
is
a
bore
well
what
do
you
propose
to
do
about
it
quizzed
the
young
doctor
a
bit
impatiently
i
propose
to
do
this
about
it
said
the
woman
i
propose
to
become
a
reformer
a
reformer
jeered
the
young
doctor
well
then
an
avenger
if
you
like
the
word
better
conceded
the
woman
oh
i
shall
keep
right
on
buying
things
of
course
she
hastened
mockingly
to
assure
him
and
giving
things
of
course
one
could
hardly
break
so
suddenly
the
habit
and
vice
of
a
life
time
only
i
sha
scatter
my
shots
all
over
the
lot
any
more
but
concentrate
my
deadliest
aim
on
one
single
individual
indeed
i
think
i
shall
advertise
mocked
the
woman
in
that
amazing
column
of
all
daily
papers
so
misleadingly
labeled
instead
of
i
shall
insert
some
sort
of
a
statement
to
the
effect
that
an
eccentric
woman
of
fabulous
wealth
lavish
generosity
and
no
common
sense
whatsoever
will
receive
into
her
southern
home
one
stingy
receiver
strictest
reference
required
object
reformation
or
annihilation
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
the
answers
you
get
rallied
the
young
doctor
with
unwonted
playfulness
almost
imperceptibly
the
woman
twisted
her
eyebrows
oh
of
course
i
admit
that
most
of
them
would
be
from
asylums
she
said
offering
me
special
rates
but
there
always
a
chance
of
course
that
that
straight
as
a
both
eyebrows
dropped
suddenly
into
line
but
i
quite
used
to
taking
chances
thank
you
she
finished
with
exaggerated
bruskness
what
else
do
you
propose
to
take
asked
the
young
doctor
a
bit
dryly
said
the
woman
at
the
edge
of
the
bureau
the
young
doctor
wheeled
abruptly
in
his
tracks
well
you
won
t
he
said
his
face
was
quite
white
with
anger
why
not
drawled
the
woman
as
ruthlessly
as
a
child
she
seemed
to
be
estimating
suddenly
the
faintly
perceptible
shine
of
the
shoulder
seams
only
the
frankness
of
the
stare
relieved
it
of
its
insolence
why
not
she
said
is
your
practice
here
so
huge
that
you
can
totally
afford
to
ignore
a
salary
such
as
i
would
give
you
nevertheless
winced
the
young
doctor
even
can
not
buy
everything
ca
i
smiled
the
woman
in
passionate
willfulness
and
pride
her
smile
straightened
out
again
into
its
line
but
i
need
you
she
asserted
arrogantly
i
like
you
if
i
had
had
my
choice
of
every
practitioner
in
the
city
i
i
with
a
precipitous
whimper
of
nerves
the
tears
began
suddenly
to
stream
down
her
cheeks
there
is
there
is
something
about
you
she
stammered
in
a
in
a
trolley
car
accident
in
a
steamer
panic
out
of
a
out
of
a
thousand
she
sobbed
i
instinctively
would
have
turned
to
you
as
abruptly
as
it
had
come
the
flood
of
tears
vanished
from
her
face
leaving
instead
a
flicker
of
incredulity
why
i
do
even
know
how
i
did
happen
to
get
you
she
admitted
aghast
out
of
all
the
doctors
in
the
city
it
must
have
been
intended
it
must
if
there
any
providence
at
all
it
must
arrange
such
details
how
did
i
happen
to
get
you
she
demanded
imperiously
for
the
first
time
across
the
young
doctor
lean
ascetic
face
an
expression
of
relaxation
quickened
well
if
you
really
want
to
know
he
said
as
you
were
being
lifted
out
of
your
carriage
at
the
hotel
door
i
was
just
coming
out
of
the
free
lunch
hunger
or
thirst
scoffed
the
woman
none
of
your
business
smiled
the
young
doctor
oh
and
besides
rallied
the
woman
instantly
i
thought
likely
as
not
that
there
might
be
some
girl
somebody
you
could
coach
about
my
passion
for
shopping
i
mean
i
do
care
who
gets
the
things
if
there
anybody
you
like
she
might
just
as
well
be
the
one
thank
you
rebristled
the
young
doctor
but
i
do
happen
to
know
any
girls
good
enough
said
the
woman
then
there
nothing
at
all
to
complicate
your
coming
but
i
not
coming
stared
the
young
doctor
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
were
dilated
like
a
deer
jacked
suddenly
with
an
infuriating
light
but
you
are
coming
said
the
woman
without
a
flicker
of
emotion
day
after
tomorrow
it
is
at
from
the
pennsylvania
station
i
not
said
the
young
doctor
you
are
said
the
woman
when
it
comes
right
down
to
the
matter
of
statistics
just
how
many
times
in
your
life
you
had
your
own
way
and
just
how
many
times
you
have
tome
gallien
was
not
exaggerating
when
she
boasted
to
the
young
doctor
that
she
was
quite
in
the
habit
of
having
her
own
way
she
certainly
was
in
the
majority
of
incidents
she
had
indeed
always
had
her
own
way
and
in
the
majority
of
incidents
she
had
her
own
way
now
that
is
to
say
that
the
south
carolina
train
did
leave
the
pennsylvania
station
at
just
exactly
the
time
she
said
it
would
and
martha
the
deaf
was
on
that
train
and
she
herself
was
on
that
train
but
the
young
doctor
was
not
not
much
much
was
the
way
the
young
doctor
said
it
if
you
really
want
to
know
but
he
said
very
little
else
that
afternoon
to
be
perfectly
frank
his
luncheon
had
been
very
poor
and
his
breakfast
before
that
and
his
dinner
before
that
further
reiteration
would
be
purely
monotonous
moreover
on
this
particular
february
day
the
weather
was
extravagantly
northern
his
office
as
cold
and
dark
and
bleak
as
some
untenanted
back
alley
and
his
general
professional
prospects
as
dull
as
if
not
indeed
duller
than
the
last
puff
of
ashes
in
his
pipe
yet
even
so
he
counted
his
situation
ecstasy
compared
to
the
thought
of
being
dragged
south
by
the
of
a
as
headstrong
as
she
was
not
much
long
after
there
was
no
tugging
warm
taste
left
in
his
pipe
he
was
still
tugging
at
the
phrase
not
much
but
tome
gallien
on
her
fine
train
scudding
south
was
even
more
chary
of
words
than
he
when
it
came
to
her
own
comment
on
his
defection
idjot
she
telegraphed
back
from
washington
the
operator
who
repeated
the
message
over
the
telephone
was
frankly
apologetic
yes
doctor
explained
the
metallic
voice
that
just
exactly
the
way
we
received
it
it
is
even
argued
the
voice
because
we
wired
back
for
verification
that
what
it
is
maybe
it
a
a
code
word
condoned
the
voice
amiably
it
certainly
was
a
code
word
and
the
message
that
it
sought
to
convey
was
plainly
this
how
any
young
struggling
practitioner
in
a
strange
city
with
not
only
his
future
to
make
but
even
his
present
how
such
a
one
has
got
the
nerve
the
nerve
i
say
to
refuse
a
regular
salaried
position
and
all
expenses
all
expenses
mind
you
in
a
salubrious
climate
and
with
a
lady
well
with
a
lady
whom
other
men
infinitely
wiser
and
more
sophisticated
than
he
have
not
found
utterly
devoid
perhaps
of
interest
and
charm
talk
about
being
packed
surely
no
suitcase
could
ever
have
bulged
more
with
significance
than
did
this
one
tiny
telegram
idjot
and
equally
surely
its
context
dressed
the
young
doctor
mind
quite
completely
for
almost
a
week
but
the
great
square
white
envelope
that
arrived
in
due
time
from
tome
gallien
had
nothing
in
it
at
all
except
a
check
no
reproaches
i
mean
no
upbraidings
no
convalescent
rhapsodies
of
gratitude
even
just
a
plain
straightforward
unsentimental
black
and
white
check
covering
so
many
professional
visits
at
so
much
a
visit
a
man
might
have
sent
it
a
perfectly
well
man
i
mean
and
so
the
episode
ends
mused
the
young
doctor
with
distinct
satisfaction
but
it
did
end
so
of
course
women
like
tome
gallien
were
not
created
to
end
things
but
to
start
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
leaven
it
was
on
the
following
thursday
that
the
grand
piano
arrived
at
the
young
doctor
office
now
the
young
doctor
office
might
easily
have
accommodated
more
patients
than
it
did
but
piano
movers
are
almost
always
so
fat
puffing
blowing
swearing
tugging
the
whole
dingy
room
seemed
suddenly
packed
with
brawn
but
it
is
my
piano
protested
the
young
doctor
from
every
chair
desk
table
of
his
ultimate
retreat
it
my
piano
he
yelled
from
the
doorway
it
is
my
piano
he
scolded
through
the
window
but
it
was
his
piano
of
course
the
piano
movers
swore
that
it
was
the
piano
warerooms
telephoned
that
it
was
worst
of
all
the
piano
itself
on
one
plump
ankle
flaunted
a
tag
which
proclaimed
that
it
was
and
the
proclamation
was
most
distinctly
in
tome
gallien
handwriting
for
sam
kendrue
it
said
as
a
slight
token
of
my
appreciation
and
esteem
groaned
the
young
doctor
in
the
first
venom
of
his
emotion
he
sat
right
down
and
wrote
gallien
just
exactly
what
he
thought
of
her
and
of
it
it
being
of
course
the
piano
whatever
in
the
world
he
demanded
would
i
do
with
a
piano
oh
of
course
it
very
kind
of
you
and
all
that
he
conceded
with
crass
sarcasm
but
i
have
no
possible
floor
space
you
understand
beyond
my
office
and
the
very
meager
bedroom
adjoining
it
and
with
a
quarter
of
a
ton
worth
of
wood
and
wire
plunked
down
thus
in
the
exact
center
of
my
office
it
leaves
me
i
assure
you
an
extraordinarily
limited
amount
of
unless
it
be
a
sort
of
running
track
that
still
survives
around
the
extreme
edges
of
the
room
and
moreover
the
piano
is
of
rosewood
as
you
doubtless
already
know
and
all
inlaid
with
cherubim
and
seraphim
snarled
up
in
wreaths
of
lavender
roses
now
botany
i
admit
is
distinctly
out
of
my
line
but
the
cherubim
and
seraphim
are
certainly
very
weird
anatomically
and
not
knowing
one
note
from
another
as
indeed
i
remember
telling
you
quite
plainly
at
an
earlier
date
well
excuse
me
if
i
seem
harsh
he
exploded
all
over
again
but
whatever
in
the
world
would
i
do
with
a
piano
as
ingenuously
insolent
as
a
child
retort
came
tome
almost
immediate
reply
yes
what
would
you
do
that
just
exactly
it
i
thought
i
get
a
rise
out
of
you
said
tome
gallien
across
my
dulled
horizon
a
whole
heap
of
most
diverting
speculations
have
suddenly
begun
to
flash
and
brighten
in
the
world
you
do
with
a
piano
i
can
at
least
return
it
to
the
warerooms
wrote
the
young
doctor
with
significant
brevity
oh
no
you
ca
telegraphed
tome
gallien
apropos
slight
defect
and
large
merchandise
rated
while
he
was
yet
fuming
over
this
message
tome
gallien
special
delivery
letter
overtook
her
telegram
do
struggle
urged
tome
gallien
after
all
my
dear
young
antagonist
when
it
comes
right
down
to
brass
tacks
it
is
so
much
a
question
of
just
what
you
are
going
to
do
with
the
piano
as
it
is
of
just
what
the
piano
is
going
to
do
with
you
because
of
course
do
something
it
certainly
will
and
the
madder
you
get
of
course
the
more
it
will
do
and
the
madder
you
get
of
course
the
sooner
it
will
do
it
and
oh
lying
here
flat
on
my
back
in
all
this
damp
salty
stillness
tides
coming
tides
going
sands
shifting
floating
my
whole
wild
heedless
past
resolves
itself
into
one
single
illuminating
conviction
it
the
giving
people
appropriate
gifts
that
stultifies
their
characters
so
pampering
their
vanities
and
clogging
alike
both
their
impulses
and
their
ink
yes
sir
why
goodness
man
if
i
had
crocheted
you
slippers
would
it
have
joggled
you
one
iota
out
of
the
rut
of
your
daily
life
or
would
even
the
latest
design
in
operating
tables
have
quickened
one
single
of
your
snug
young
body
or
for
forty
stethoscopes
do
you
imagine
for
one
tiny
instant
that
you
would
have
written
me
twice
in
five
days
but
if
one
can
only
make
a
person
mad
instead
of
glad
now
the
real
kindness
so
invigorating
so
educative
so
poignantly
reconstructive
because
if
there
one
shining
mark
in
the
world
that
adventure
loves
it
a
shining
mad
person
even
you
for
instance
having
made
no
place
in
your
particular
rut
for
of
a
ton
of
wood
and
wire
the
advent
of
such
a
weightage
is
just
plain
naturally
bound
to
crowd
you
out
of
your
rut
and
whoever
his
rut
for
even
an
instant
well
truly
i
think
you
deserved
just
a
wee
bit
of
crowding
so
heigho
cross
laddie
and
rustle
round
as
fast
as
you
can
to
get
yourself
a
new
necktie
or
a
or
a
shine
something
certainly
is
going
to
happen
to
you
happen
right
off
i
mean
even
now
perhaps
even
with
a
grunt
of
disgust
the
young
doctor
jumped
up
and
began
to
pace
his
office
what
was
left
of
his
office
i
mean
around
the
extreme
edges
of
the
room
and
the
faster
he
paced
the
madder
he
grew
oh
the
fantasia
of
women
he
stormed
the
the
exaggeration
he
was
perfectly
right
tome
gallien
was
often
fantastic
and
certainly
quite
exaggerative
anent
the
present
situation
the
threatened
adventure
did
not
happen
at
once
it
did
happen
indeed
for
at
least
two
hours
yet
the
fact
remains
of
course
that
the
big
piano
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
adventure
science
no
doubt
would
have
refuted
the
connection
but
fancy
is
no
such
fool
surely
if
there
had
been
a
big
piano
the
young
doctor
would
never
have
worked
himself
up
into
such
a
bad
temper
on
that
particular
afternoon
and
if
he
had
worked
himself
up
into
such
a
bad
temper
he
never
would
have
flounced
himself
out
into
the
dreary
february
streets
to
try
and
walk
it
off
and
if
he
had
tried
so
hard
to
walk
it
off
he
never
would
have
developed
such
a
perfectly
ravenous
hunger
and
if
he
had
developed
such
a
perfectly
ravenous
hunger
he
never
would
have
bolted
at
just
exactly
six
for
the
brightest
lighted
restaurant
in
sight
and
it
was
on
the
street
right
in
front
of
the
brightest
lighted
restaurant
that
the
adventure
happened
even
fancy
though
would
never
have
boasted
that
it
was
anything
except
a
very
little
adventure
skies
did
fall
i
mean
nor
walls
topple
nor
bags
of
gold
roll
gaily
to
the
young
doctor
feet
just
a
car
stopped
a
great
plain
clumsy
everyday
electric
car
and
from
the
front
platform
of
it
a
girl
with
a
suitcase
in
one
hand
a
hat
box
in
the
other
and
tucked
under
one
elbow
jumped
down
into
the
mud
even
so
the
adventure
would
never
have
started
if
the
had
slipped
suddenly
from
the
girl
elbow
and
exploded
all
over
the
street
into
a
it
would
have
been
funny
of
course
if
it
had
been
so
clumsy
but
even
while
deprecating
the
digital
clumsiness
of
women
the
young
doctor
leaped
instinctively
to
the
rescue
there
were
certainly
enough
things
that
needed
rescuing
toys
they
proved
to
be
and
such
a
scattering
a
brown
plush
coon
under
the
wheels
of
a
stalled
automobile
a
flamboyant
rose
bush
trampled
to
pulp
beneath
a
cart
horse
hoofs
a
tin
steam
engine
cackling
across
a
hobbly
brick
sidewalk
a
parrot
disappearing
all
too
quickly
in
a
fox
terrier
mouth
a
doll
here
a
paint
box
there
and
the
girl
herself
standing
perfectly
helpless
in
the
midst
of
it
all
blushing
twenty
shades
of
pink
and
still
hanging
desperately
tight
to
the
leather
suitcase
in
one
hand
and
the
big
hat
box
in
the
other
and
it
is
at
all
that
i
am
so
so
stupid
she
kept
explaining
hectically
but
it
is
that
when
an
accident
occurs
so
in
english
i
can
not
think
in
english
what
to
do
if
i
put
down
my
suitcase
she
screamed
a
dog
will
bite
it
and
if
i
drop
my
box
a
trample
might
get
it
it
was
not
until
the
young
doctor
had
succeeded
in
reassembling
owner
and
articles
on
the
safe
edge
of
the
curbing
that
he
noticed
for
the
first
time
how
tall
the
girl
was
and
how
shiningly
blonde
altogether
too
tall
and
too
blonde
to
behave
like
such
an
idiot
he
argued
perfectly
illogically
with
a
last
flare
of
courtesy
he
sought
to
end
the
incident
were
you
going
to
take
another
car
he
gestured
toward
her
crowded
hands
oh
no
said
the
girl
with
a
wave
of
her
hat
box
i
was
going
to
that
restaurant
over
there
why
so
was
i
said
the
young
doctor
very
formally
so
if
you
wish
i
will
take
your
suitcase
for
you
that
will
at
least
help
a
little
without
further
parleying
they
crossed
the
snowy
street
and
still
all
and
with
the
wintry
night
bore
down
upon
the
snug
little
restaurant
like
two
young
guests
of
the
north
wind
in
fact
as
well
as
effect
the
room
was
brightly
crowded
and
seemed
to
flare
up
like
a
furnace
blast
into
their
own
chilled
faces
a
trifle
dazzled
by
the
glare
perhaps
they
faltered
suddenly
in
their
tracks
for
one
single
conspicuous
instant
blonde
as
the
moon
swarth
as
a
pine
tree
shadow
they
stood
staring
helplessly
here
there
everywhere
into
a
blur
of
frankly
upturned
faces
then
without
an
atom
warning
a
lone
woman
at
the
small
table
just
in
front
of
them
jumped
to
her
feet
why
of
course
you
poor
dears
she
beamed
you
want
to
get
seats
together
and
fled
still
beaming
to
the
one
remaining
vacant
seat
at
a
far
table
in
the
corner
a
graven
image
could
scarcely
have
helped
grinning
at
the
absurdity
of
the
incident
and
the
young
doctor
was
by
no
means
a
graven
image
as
for
the
girl
she
giggled
out
right
and
with
an
impulse
scarcely
american
pulled
out
the
young
doctor
chair
for
him
before
she
herself
darted
down
into
the
more
crumpled
place
which
the
other
woman
had
just
vacated
after
all
she
conceded
shruggingly
it
is
not
of
such
a
consequence
only
the
flaming
color
in
her
cheeks
belied
her
nonchalance
with
his
left
hand
reaching
for
the
menu
and
his
right
hand
exploring
his
pockets
the
young
doctor
sought
to
show
that
he
also
was
perfectly
nonchalant
it
it
been
a
a
very
cold
day
has
it
he
essayed
experimentally
from
her
own
frowning
contemplation
of
the
card
before
her
the
girl
lifted
her
amazingly
blue
eyes
she
said
i
think
the
chicken
soup
would
be
more
of
a
taste
than
the
bouillon
what
i
remarked
persisted
the
young
doctor
was
that
the
weather
the
weather
with
his
right
hand
still
in
his
pocket
a
most
curious
expression
of
shock
passed
suddenly
over
his
face
his
pocketbook
was
gone
quite
desperately
he
studied
the
distance
to
the
telephone
booth
the
quickest
path
to
the
door
any
direction
any
excuse
that
would
snatch
him
soonest
out
of
the
horrid
predicament
of
finding
himself
penniless
at
a
perfectly
strange
restaurant
in
the
company
of
a
perfectly
strange
girl
yet
if
he
did
bolt
thus
without
explanation
as
was
certainly
his
most
immediate
impulse
what
possible
inference
could
the
girl
draw
except
something
crudely
harsh
and
derogatory
to
her
own
frankly
guileless
personality
with
a
quite
unwonted
flush
at
his
cheek
bones
he
decided
to
make
explanations
excuse
me
he
grinned
with
a
sharp
edging
back
of
his
chair
but
it
will
not
be
my
pleasure
after
all
to
to
sample
the
chicken
soup
with
you
some
mutt
back
there
while
i
was
picking
up
those
cursed
toys
quite
frantically
again
he
began
to
rummage
through
all
his
pockets
some
mutt
has
pinched
my
pocketbook
he
finished
perfectly
simply
what
cried
the
girl
what
with
her
eyes
still
staring
blue
and
wide
she
reached
out
a
slim
strong
detaining
hand
to
his
sleeve
you
mean
that
you
can
not
thus
have
any
supper
she
frowned
and
the
night
also
so
dark
and
so
cold
why
what
nonsense
she
beamed
suddenly
i
have
moneys
to
drown
no
is
it
burn
that
you
say
she
corrected
herself
and
thrust
her
own
purse
at
him
chucklingly
like
a
child
she
began
to
rock
herself
to
and
fro
certainly
it
is
all
of
a
very
great
fatedness
she
reveled
first
you
pick
up
my
shoppings
for
me
and
now
it
is
that
i
pick
up
your
supper
for
you
what
no
she
stammered
as
the
young
doctor
quite
curtly
refused
the
purse
and
rose
very
definitely
to
his
feet
across
the
translucent
blondness
of
her
upturned
face
astonishment
incredulity
glowered
suddenly
like
a
dark
shadow
what
no
is
it
then
so
correct
she
protested
is
it
kind
is
it
senselike
that
for
so
small
a
trifle
you
should
is
it
that
you
say
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
certainly
it
was
not
of
my
boldness
she
quickened
but
of
the
boldness
of
that
demented
woman
yonder
that
i
sit
here
then
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
all
the
shadow
vanished
from
her
face
leaving
just
laughter
again
and
a
vaguely
provocative
sort
of
challenge
oh
go
if
it
seems
most
best
to
be
of
such
a
silliness
she
said
but
if
you
go
i
shall
certainly
laugh
laugh
with
loudness
i
mean
right
out
and
like
this
with
the
handles
of
my
knife
and
fork
she
threatened
to
illustrate
i
will
beat
upon
the
table
while
i
laugh
bah
she
gesticulated
encouragingly
towards
the
deserted
chair
what
is
the
price
of
a
supper
between
two
gentlemans
oh
of
course
if
you
feel
like
that
conceded
the
young
doctor
as
he
slipped
back
into
his
seat
quite
frankly
he
admitted
i
should
hate
to
be
even
the
innocent
cause
of
your
beating
upon
the
table
with
the
handles
of
your
knife
and
fork
so
if
you
really
and
truly
think
i
look
honest
he
confided
with
an
exaggerated
resumption
of
interest
in
the
bill
of
fare
let
me
see
sixty
cents
is
it
and
the
tip
and
two
cents
for
a
postage
stamp
yes
i
surely
ought
to
be
able
to
return
that
much
by
at
least
noon
without
a
flicker
of
expression
he
lifted
his
dark
eyes
to
hers
without
a
flicker
of
expression
she
resumed
the
conversation
at
the
exact
point
apparently
where
she
had
been
most
reluctant
to
leave
it
off
and
so
she
brightened
after
the
chicken
soup
would
it
not
seem
to
you
for
instance
that
turkey
would
be
infinitely
more
chic
than
than
corned
beef
quite
regardless
of
his
possible
negative
she
turned
quickly
and
summoned
a
waitress
to
her
behold
it
is
now
a
dinner
party
she
confided
blithely
to
the
perfectly
indifferent
woman
the
soup
the
turkey
the
best
of
your
salads
the
blackest
of
your
coffee
everything
very
chic
very
what
queried
the
waitress
very
quick
interposed
the
young
doctor
once
again
without
a
flicker
of
expression
the
dark
eyes
and
the
blue
challenged
each
other
across
the
narrow
width
of
white
table
cloth
then
the
owner
of
the
blue
eyes
reached
out
and
drained
her
glass
of
ice
water
at
a
single
draught
ah
she
shivered
i
also
am
in
more
hurry
than
you
but
it
would
not
seem
to
me
polite
to
nag
about
it
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
stammered
the
young
doctor
and
retreated
in
turn
to
his
own
glass
of
ice
water
it
was
not
until
the
soup
course
was
almost
over
that
he
succumbed
to
any
further
conversational
impulse
and
even
then
indeed
it
was
formality
rather
than
sociability
that
drove
him
to
the
effort
seeing
that
you
are
so
kind
he
succeeded
in
enunciating
and
so
so
trusting
he
relaxed
ever
so
slightly
the
least
i
can
do
certainly
is
to
identify
myself
my
name
is
sam
kendrue
and
i
am
a
doctor
conceded
the
girl
without
enthusiasm
quite
frankly
she
made
it
clear
that
the
waitress
approaching
with
the
turkey
was
the
only
fact
in
the
world
that
concerned
her
at
that
immediate
moment
yet
as
one
who
would
conscientiously
acknowledge
on
second
thought
that
no
honest
bit
of
information
was
ever
really
to
be
scoffed
at
she
laid
down
her
knife
and
fork
presently
and
surveyed
the
young
doctor
with
a
slightly
reviving
interest
sam
sam
kendrue
she
repeated
painstakingly
my
name
is
solvei
kjelland
she
announced
with
brisk
and
resumed
her
eating
your
name
is
what
puzzled
the
young
doctor
solvei
kjelland
she
smiled
ever
so
faintly
she
spelled
out
as
one
quite
familiarly
accustomed
to
such
a
task
i
am
a
norwegian
she
flared
up
suddenly
with
the
ecstatic
breathlessness
of
one
who
confides
a
really
significant
surprise
a
norwegian
rallied
the
young
doctor
for
the
first
time
behind
the
quick
shield
of
his
hand
a
little
teasing
smile
began
to
twitch
really
you
you
surprise
me
he
recovered
with
an
almost
instantly
forced
gravity
from
your
accent
now
i
had
supposed
all
along
that
you
were
er
celtic
celtic
queried
the
girl
then
with
one
shrewd
glance
at
the
young
doctor
immobile
face
she
burst
out
laughing
it
was
not
a
loud
laugh
it
was
indeed
a
very
little
laugh
and
most
distinctly
musical
but
in
that
instant
the
whole
attention
of
the
room
seemed
to
focus
itself
suddenly
on
that
one
helpless
little
table
is
there
anything
specially
peculiar
looking
about
us
i
wonder
bristled
the
young
doctor
or
rather
about
me
i
should
say
he
corrected
himself
quickly
even
that
that
philanthropic
woman
he
fumed
who
vacated
this
table
for
us
well
of
course
i
would
say
exactly
that
she
was
climbing
up
on
the
rungs
of
her
chair
but
oh
that
nothing
said
the
girl
with
unruffled
nonchalance
she
been
staring
at
us
all
of
the
evening
everybody
been
staring
at
us
all
of
the
evening
she
added
amiably
very
daintily
but
none
the
less
expeditiously
as
she
spoke
she
began
to
turn
her
attention
to
the
crisp
green
salad
at
her
plate
it
is
because
we
are
both
so
tall
and
fine
she
confided
without
an
atom
of
oh
well
really
speak
for
yourself
flushed
the
young
doctor
for
myself
she
repeated
a
bit
speculatively
once
again
in
a
moment
of
temporary
arrestment
she
laid
down
her
knife
and
fork
to
scrutinize
the
young
doctor
face
oh
no
she
reassured
him
almost
at
once
you
are
most
tall
and
fine
too
and
so
brune
to
my
blonde
she
confided
as
she
took
up
her
fork
again
certainly
it
is
most
striking
of
us
she
mused
at
last
more
to
the
lettuce
than
to
the
young
doctor
but
that
poor
womans
over
there
she
rallied
transiently
everywhere
one
goes
it
is
the
same
old
maid
is
it
that
you
call
her
so
sad
so
neglected
so
is
it
that
you
say
everybodys
she
sees
she
thinks
it
is
young
lovers
but
personally
said
the
girl
i
am
still
very
hungry
let
us
take
what
dessert
is
proffered
oh
of
course
acquiesced
the
young
doctor
if
i
got
to
be
if
we
got
to
be
stared
at
i
mean
it
would
certainly
be
quite
as
comfortable
to
have
something
to
do
perfectly
smiled
the
girl
so
as
we
wait
for
the
ices
and
the
pies
let
us
see
what
is
survived
of
the
toys
and
before
the
young
doctor
could
dissuade
her
she
had
lifted
her
awkwardly
retied
bundle
to
the
level
of
the
table
and
was
earnestly
studying
out
the
relative
damages
of
the
parrot
and
the
tiny
tin
railroad
train
to
confirm
apparently
what
was
her
own
suspicion
in
the
matter
she
handed
the
railroad
train
to
the
young
doctor
for
investigation
and
because
the
young
doctor
was
naturally
and
sincerely
inquisitive
about
anything
that
was
broken
he
bent
his
dark
head
to
the
task
with
a
sudden
real
gasp
of
relief
and
for
the
next
five
minutes
at
least
all
possible
awkwardness
between
them
seemed
merged
then
and
there
into
the
easy
argument
of
a
thoroughly
familiar
and
accustomed
association
once
again
their
small
table
became
the
cynosure
of
all
eyes
the
dark
young
doctor
alone
was
quite
sufficiently
striking
looking
and
the
girl
in
her
norse
glow
and
blondness
would
have
been
a
marked
figure
anywhere
but
together
and
now
at
this
very
minute
so
anxious
so
painstaking
so
brooding
if
the
room
had
thought
them
shy
young
lovers
a
scant
half
hour
before
goodness
knows
what
it
thought
them
now
the
woman
in
the
corner
had
most
certainly
reconstructed
her
original
impressions
on
the
way
out
from
her
own
unsocial
supper
she
stopped
impulsively
just
behind
the
young
chair
to
watch
his
rather
surprising
manipulation
of
the
fractured
toy
engine
wheel
her
face
was
by
no
means
unpleasant
but
almost
exaggeratedly
friendly
in
a
plaintive
deprecating
sort
of
way
from
their
focus
on
the
young
doctor
hands
her
pale
eyes
lifted
suddenly
to
the
girl
glowing
face
and
she
held
out
a
small
paper
bagful
of
cakes
take
those
home
she
said
instead
of
the
poor
broken
toys
why
why
thank
you
laughed
the
girl
how
how
old
are
your
little
ones
asked
the
woman
quite
irrelevantly
eh
jerked
the
young
doctor
from
his
joggled
hands
the
little
tin
railroad
train
crashed
down
into
his
plate
with
her
hands
clapped
playfully
to
her
ears
the
girl
looked
thoughtfully
up
at
her
accoster
why
lisa
is
four
she
said
quite
simply
and
jonathan
is
six
and
oh
have
you
got
a
kindled
the
woman
her
sallow
face
was
suddenly
quite
transfigured
with
light
and
does
he
look
like
you
she
cried
or
sweeping
the
table
with
another
deprecating
glance
or
does
he
take
after
his
father
take
after
his
father
repeated
the
girl
in
frank
perplexity
her
own
sweeping
glance
of
her
companion
face
did
not
seem
somehow
to
elucidate
the
mystery
after
his
father
she
flamed
i
do
not
know
the
idiot
the
idio
the
idiom
she
corrected
herself
triumphantly
a
little
bit
perplexed
herself
the
amiable
stranger
began
suddenly
to
button
up
her
coat
well
good
night
she
beamed
good
night
good
night
i
hope
you
may
both
live
to
enjoy
to
the
uttermost
the
full
merits
of
your
little
family
eh
jumped
the
young
doctor
white
as
a
sheet
he
was
suddenly
on
his
feet
and
for
the
first
time
that
evening
a
smile
had
twisted
itself
across
at
least
one
side
of
his
mouth
madam
he
bowed
neither
this
young
lady
here
nor
i
have
ever
laid
eyes
on
each
other
before
nor
is
it
remotely
probable
indeed
that
in
the
normal
course
of
events
we
should
ever
lay
eyes
on
each
other
again
but
if
you
persist
so
he
bowed
with
a
purely
nervous
glance
at
his
watch
but
if
you
persist
so
in
your
in
your
he
floundered
futilely
we
shall
doubtless
be
lying
in
the
same
grave
by
midnight
without
even
a
gasp
then
he
snatched
up
the
girl
purse
her
suitcase
her
hat
box
his
own
coat
and
hat
and
bolted
for
the
cashier
desk
close
behind
him
clasping
her
scattered
toys
as
best
she
might
to
her
breast
followed
the
blonde
norse
girl
even
when
they
had
finally
reached
the
electric
light
post
on
the
farthest
corner
of
the
street
the
color
was
only
just
beginning
to
flush
back
into
the
young
doctor
cheek
bones
if
you
will
now
give
me
the
address
he
said
tersely
to
which
i
can
forward
the
supper
money
i
will
put
you
on
a
street
car
oh
the
address
of
course
is
of
perfect
simplicity
conceded
the
girl
but
i
do
not
care
for
you
to
put
me
on
a
street
car
thank
you
why
certainly
i
shall
put
you
on
a
street
car
insisted
the
young
doctor
he
was
really
quite
sharp
about
it
almost
everything
goes
by
here
if
you
only
wait
long
enough
he
shifted
a
bit
uneasily
as
he
set
down
both
box
and
suitcase
with
a
most
decided
thump
silently
then
for
what
seemed
to
him
an
interminable
time
they
stood
there
on
the
icy
curbstone
staring
out
into
the
passing
green
red
yellow
lights
pretty
is
it
not
commented
the
girl
at
last
shivered
the
young
doctor
why
yes
of
course
suppose
so
but
which
car
he
laughed
impatiently
for
sake
do
you
know
where
you
want
to
go
of
course
i
know
where
i
want
to
go
flared
the
girl
with
a
little
light
touch
on
his
sleeve
she
pointed
off
to
another
electric
light
post
on
a
side
street
there
she
said
that
little
pleasant
fifth
house
from
the
end
that
is
where
i
am
at
boarding
well
why
did
you
say
so
flushed
the
young
doctor
very
vehemently
once
more
he
snatched
up
her
suitcase
and
her
hat
box
with
a
shrug
of
her
fine
athletic
shoulders
the
girl
laughed
right
out
loud
into
his
frowning
eyes
when
a
man
is
of
such
a
positiveness
as
you
are
she
confided
impishly
it
is
a
privilege
to
reduce
his
national
characteristics
ever
for
one
single
instant
do
you
ask
me
you
finish
your
food
or
you
want
to
be
put
on
a
car
but
always
at
your
first
wish
you
hurry
out
and
scoot
crying
put
you
on
a
car
i
put
you
on
a
car
with
a
little
sniff
of
scorn
she
turned
on
her
heel
and
started
off
at
a
fine
stride
toward
the
house
to
which
she
had
just
pointed
it
was
the
young
doctor
now
who
followed
precipitously
after
the
street
was
certainly
a
quaint
one
and
the
boarding
house
in
question
by
no
means
lacking
in
a
fine
though
dingy
sort
of
dignity
but
the
doorbell
that
the
girl
rang
and
rang
brought
no
reassuring
answer
fumbling
anxiously
in
her
purse
for
a
moment
she
threw
out
her
hands
with
a
little
gesture
of
dismay
it
is
that
i
must
also
have
mislaid
my
key
she
frowned
then
like
a
flash
of
pale
sunshine
her
smile
seemed
to
drive
every
possible
shadow
from
her
mind
oh
well
she
cried
it
is
after
all
only
a
scarce
seven
some
one
in
not
many
minutes
will
surely
come
and
meanwhile
she
glowed
of
such
a
fine
night
i
will
just
sit
down
here
very
happy
and
take
the
air
take
the
air
gasped
the
young
doctor
quite
unconsciously
as
he
spoke
he
reached
up
and
drew
his
fur
collar
a
little
bit
closer
about
his
neck
but
already
the
girl
had
dropped
casually
down
on
the
top
step
and
opened
the
throat
of
her
own
red
coat
as
one
who
was
fairly
thirsting
for
air
good
night
she
said
briskly
said
the
young
doctor
before
he
had
even
reached
the
lower
step
he
was
congratulating
himself
that
the
incident
was
now
safely
ended
comfortably
ended
he
meant
instead
of
awkwardly
as
it
might
so
easily
have
been
foreigners
were
often
so
irrational
he
considered
even
as
he
considered
he
turned
in
spite
of
himself
to
investigate
the
sudden
unmistakable
rustle
of
a
paper
bag
his
suspicion
was
frankly
confirmed
see
brandished
the
girl
triumphantly
the
little
pink
cake
of
the
foolish
woman
with
an
unmistakable
chuckle
of
joy
her
white
teeth
met
through
the
treasure
in
the
flash
of
a
second
the
perfectly
idiotic
impulse
of
a
joke
the
young
doctor
lifted
a
warning
finger
at
her
you
realize
of
course
that
you
are
eating
a
a
misapprehension
he
admonished
her
with
really
terrifying
severity
a
misapprehension
jumped
the
girl
very
painstakingly
then
and
there
she
began
to
explore
the
remaining
piece
of
cake
in
her
hand
tugging
at
its
sponginess
peering
under
its
frostedness
then
suddenly
with
a
little
quick
gasp
of
relief
she
popped
the
sweet
morsel
into
her
mouth
and
smacked
her
lips
upon
it
oh
no
she
beamed
it
tastes
perfectly
all
right
to
me
like
a
word
slipping
hopelessly
down
a
poem
toward
whatever
chosen
rhyme
its
poet
has
already
in
mind
the
young
doctor
suddenly
found
himself
bumping
rather
perilously
close
to
the
one
big
wild
hoot
of
laughter
that
had
evidently
been
lurking
for
him
in
the
situation
even
from
the
very
first
in
a
really
desperate
effort
to
fend
himself
as
long
as
possible
from
such
an
undignified
disaster
he
hastened
in
all
sincerity
to
rewrap
himself
in
his
stiffest
professional
manner
well
what
about
this
and
business
he
questioned
with
unmistakable
reproach
oh
shucks
shrugged
the
girl
this
tiresome
lisa
and
jonathan
their
whole
parents
are
bakers
but
as
for
me
she
lowered
her
voice
and
thrust
out
her
hands
with
a
soft
appealing
gesture
but
as
for
me
until
for
four
whole
weeks
i
cry
such
salt
into
my
food
i
can
not
eat
homesickness
yes
she
nodded
with
a
quick
little
catch
of
her
breath
in
all
the
world
no
one
to
speak
with
except
one
fat
lady
and
one
thin
lady
and
lisa
and
jonathan
and
peter
and
in
an
extra
impulse
of
confidence
not
unmixed
evidently
with
a
certain
flare
of
pride
she
slid
forward
a
little
on
the
step
i
am
montessori
she
said
what
snapped
the
young
doctor
why
what
nonsense
he
said
why
what
are
you
talking
about
is
a
a
system
and
she
an
italian
too
i
mean
yes
truly
so
conceded
the
girl
and
in
time
if
the
homeache
can
be
assuaged
i
shall
then
learn
the
system
and
remain
yet
a
norwegian
oh
you
mean
you
are
a
montessori
student
brightened
the
young
doctor
even
so
said
the
girl
i
can
not
wait
to
learn
everything
from
here
after
i
have
duly
studied
little
lisa
little
peter
and
all
the
others
whose
minds
most
happily
are
of
a
perfect
brightness
i
must
then
go
on
to
the
sadder
schools
and
to
that
most
wonderful
place
in
your
massachusetts
where
such
first
brain
work
of
all
was
made
on
the
little
children
it
is
that
in
norway
she
winced
i
have
a
little
brother
our
father
makes
much
money
she
added
with
apparent
irrelevance
and
spends
much
and
gives
much
and
once
he
married
him
a
new
wife
and
there
are
many
new
children
and
one
of
them
this
little
little
brother
so
gold
so
blue
so
pinky
all
day
long
he
sits
and
is
she
finished
perfectly
simply
why
why
that
too
bad
said
the
young
doctor
yes
very
bad
mused
the
girl
but
some
of
these
ideas
here
are
of
a
great
cleverness
i
do
not
of
course
get
any
of
it
right
yet
she
acknowledged
but
some
of
it
is
quite
sporting
like
a
game
with
these
toys
now
she
pointed
and
all
glad
things
like
industries
and
the
live
cat
and
the
dog
and
grasses
and
the
flowers
you
leave
the
little
child
quite
loose
it
seems
only
watching
him
watching
him
very
close
one
day
two
days
a
hundred
if
it
seems
best
and
wherever
he
shall
in
finality
in
finality
is
it
that
you
say
to
the
sweet
flowers
or
the
wood
blocks
or
the
gay
smoothen
cat
it
is
that
the
one
big
chance
of
his
salvation
will
most
surely
be
found
but
the
engine
or
the
blocks
or
the
smoothen
cat
must
not
be
forced
on
him
it
is
so
you
understand
of
such
there
would
make
no
message
to
his
development
but
out
of
it
is
that
he
himself
must
gravitate
to
it
in
the
tense
sweet
earnestness
of
her
up
turned
face
the
eager
unconscious
nearness
of
her
occasional
gesture
the
far
remoteness
of
her
subject
the
sting
of
the
winter
night
the
glare
of
electric
light
over
all
it
dawned
on
the
young
doctor
a
bit
startlingly
that
he
was
frowning
down
into
the
eyes
of
a
particularly
beautiful
woman
and
for
some
quite
unreasonable
reason
his
cheeks
began
suddenly
to
burn
like
fire
it
was
as
though
having
all
his
life
long
for
one
conscientious
reason
or
another
denied
himself
wine
when
it
was
red
he
found
himself
now
most
humiliatingly
with
itself
going
to
his
head
and
just
because
he
was
so
thoroughly
unaccustomed
to
having
anything
go
to
his
head
it
went
quite
uproariously
in
fact
changing
for
that
one
moment
his
whole
facial
expression
and
the
instant
his
facial
expression
was
changed
of
course
he
looked
like
a
different
man
and
the
instant
he
looked
like
a
different
man
of
course
he
began
to
act
like
a
different
man
and
does
this
wonderful
theory
of
yours
apply
only
to
poor
little
children
he
asked
with
slightly
narrowing
eyes
or
am
i
to
infer
he
laughed
or
am
i
to
infer
that
after
a
whole
year
of
flaunting
city
a
whole
year
of
barren
indifference
to
it
my
amazing
gravitation
to
you
this
evening
is
positive
montessori
proof
that
with
you
and
you
only
rests
my
life
best
salvation
then
without
the
slightest
intent
of
doing
it
without
even
the
slightest
warning
to
himself
that
he
was
going
to
do
it
he
swooped
down
suddenly
and
kissed
her
on
her
lips
with
a
little
gasp
of
dismay
the
girl
stumbled
to
her
feet
there
was
nothing
blonde
now
about
her
towering
up
on
the
step
just
above
him
she
was
like
a
young
all
flame
and
shadow
oh
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
act
thus
she
demanded
with
the
tears
streaming
down
her
face
she
lashed
him
with
furious
accusations
you
are
one
of
these
devils
she
cried
you
are
a
wild
persons
was
it
my
fault
she
demanded
that
my
bundles
burst
from
the
car
was
it
my
fault
she
demanded
that
restaurants
can
not
block
foolish
women
from
their
food
was
it
my
fault
that
i
paid
for
your
stupid
supper
neither
defending
himself
nor
seeking
relief
in
flight
but
with
a
face
fully
if
not
indeed
more
shocked
than
hers
the
young
doctor
sank
down
on
the
step
at
her
feet
and
with
his
head
in
his
hands
sat
rocking
himself
to
and
fro
no
it
is
your
fault
he
assured
her
and
reassured
her
nor
is
it
exactly
my
fault
he
insisted
but
the
fault
of
that
damned
piano
the
fault
of
that
damned
what
quoted
the
girl
a
bit
stridently
but
the
face
that
lifted
to
hers
was
frankly
the
face
of
a
stricken
man
only
a
chill
added
to
repentance
could
have
altered
so
any
human
countenance
on
the
honor
of
a
man
freezing
to
death
he
attested
there
is
no
blame
to
be
attached
to
anything
in
the
world
except
to
a
grand
piano
what
is
it
that
you
mean
puzzled
the
girl
i
am
more
furious
with
you
than
devils
but
i
must
hear
everything
i
mean
sneezed
the
poor
young
doctor
that
i
am
looking
for
a
kind
home
for
a
grand
piano
even
to
himself
his
words
sounded
far
away
and
altogether
the
words
of
a
stranger
it
was
indeed
as
though
he
had
been
thrust
quite
unrehearsed
into
the
leading
part
of
a
roaring
farce
which
was
already
halfway
through
its
evening
performance
a
fearful
spirit
of
bravado
seemed
really
his
one
chance
of
making
any
possible
with
the
whole
mad
situation
but
even
an
irate
audience
could
not
have
misjudged
for
a
moment
the
acute
distress
and
anxiety
behind
the
bravado
it
is
just
this
way
he
began
all
over
again
a
perfectly
dreadful
woman
drove
me
out
of
my
office
with
a
grand
piano
from
the
stony
expression
however
in
the
girl
face
this
did
not
seem
to
be
just
the
cue
that
she
was
looking
for
in
the
wisest
impulse
of
his
life
he
decided
suddenly
to
throw
himself
upon
her
sense
of
mercy
rather
than
upon
her
sense
of
humor
truly
it
is
this
way
he
jumped
up
and
implored
her
to
believe
him
i
am
as
new
as
you
almost
in
this
big
city
equally
with
you
perhaps
i
suffer
what
you
call
homeacheness
it
is
very
hard
to
get
a
good
start
in
a
strange
place
lots
of
charity
chances
and
all
that
but
very
little
money
i
had
a
real
patient
once
though
he
bragged
ironically
a
very
rich
woman
awfully
nice
and
all
that
but
i
hate
her
every
chance
that
she
gets
she
torments
me
she
has
a
sort
of
theory
i
think
that
tormenting
is
very
stimulating
to
the
nervous
system
it
certainly
is
we
fight
like
young
cats
and
dogs
and
yet
as
i
say
she
is
awfully
nice
and
when
she
went
away
she
paid
me
not
only
justly
but
mighty
generously
for
my
brief
services
it
cancelled
almost
a
year
debts
but
she
was
horridly
mad
because
i
would
go
with
her
as
a
kind
of
a
trained
tame
attendant
you
know
but
i
told
her
i
could
leave
my
office
so
she
sent
me
a
grand
piano
the
wretch
he
finished
with
flaming
anger
to
the
step
just
below
him
the
girl
tripped
down
and
turning
about
stood
peering
up
into
his
face
with
a
rather
disconcerting
intensity
here
am
i
she
gasped
who
suffer
and
languish
for
a
piano
as
you
call
it
and
you
as
though
in
real
pain
she
began
to
wring
her
slim
hands
together
and
you
a
lady
gives
you
a
grand
piano
and
you
curse
her
as
a
wretchedness
yes
i
know
deprecated
the
young
doctor
but
you
see
there
is
room
in
my
office
for
both
the
piano
and
myself
my
office
is
too
small
you
see
and
with
the
piano
filling
up
the
whole
center
of
the
room
why
it
absurd
he
quickened
it
rotten
patients
who
come
do
know
whether
they
come
for
a
music
lesson
or
to
be
lanced
and
besides
he
added
as
his
most
culminative
grievance
i
do
know
one
note
from
another
and
the
woman
knew
that
i
did
and
worse
than
anything
there
are
hordes
of
the
most
indecent
little
cupids
appliqued
or
something
all
over
the
front
of
the
thing
surely
something
could
be
done
suggested
the
girl
with
a
vague
sort
of
farawayness
in
her
blue
eyes
yes
that
just
it
remarked
the
young
doctor
flushing
already
done
it
abjectly
with
his
bared
head
bowed
before
her
he
stood
as
one
awaiting
just
sentence
of
a
personally
said
the
girl
with
her
own
cheeks
spotting
bright
red
of
a
personally
i
do
not
quite
see
the
connection
why
the
connection
is
perfectly
clear
insisted
the
young
doctor
she
sent
me
the
piano
on
purpose
to
crowd
me
out
of
my
office
she
wanted
to
crowd
me
out
of
my
own
office
she
dared
to
affirm
even
that
i
needed
to
be
crowded
out
of
my
own
office
she
tried
to
make
me
mad
she
wanted
to
make
me
mad
she
had
the
cheek
to
suggest
i
mean
that
nothing
really
interesting
ever
would
happen
to
me
until
i
once
did
get
good
and
mad
as
though
temporarily
exhausted
by
his
tirade
he
sagged
back
for
a
moment
against
the
railing
of
the
steps
his
face
did
look
a
bit
white
and
his
teeth
were
almost
chattering
well
i
certainly
did
get
good
and
mad
this
afternoon
he
affirmed
with
a
wry
sort
of
apology
and
because
i
was
so
blooming
mad
i
dashed
out
for
a
tremendous
walk
and
because
i
took
such
a
tremendous
walk
i
developed
an
appetite
like
forty
tigers
and
because
i
developed
an
appetite
like
forty
tigers
i
rushed
for
the
first
restaurant
i
could
find
and
because
i
rushed
for
the
first
restaurant
i
could
find
i
happened
to
see
you
at
the
exact
moment
when
oh
stop
stop
stop
laughed
the
girl
with
her
hands
clapped
suddenly
over
her
ears
it
is
all
too
much
like
the
like
house
that
the
built
well
at
least
grinned
the
young
doctor
it
seems
to
be
adventure
that
the
grand
piano
threatened
the
the
adventure
puzzled
the
girl
why
yes
insisted
the
young
doctor
that
what
this
tome
gallien
prophesied
you
know
that
the
piano
would
bring
me
an
adventure
so
you
very
evidently
are
the
what
i
stammered
the
girl
a
flush
of
real
pleasure
glowed
suddenly
in
her
face
and
faded
again
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
oh
no
she
said
with
some
hauteur
you
you
oh
truly
begged
the
young
doctor
i
most
awfully
sorry
for
what
i
did
i
ca
think
what
possessed
me
i
must
have
gone
quite
mad
for
the
moment
why
really
he
flushed
i
do
know
whether
you
believe
me
or
not
and
maybe
it
something
anyway
to
be
more
ashamed
of
than
to
brag
about
but
truly
now
he
floundered
i
have
kissed
a
girl
before
since
since
i
was
very
little
with
a
sudden
quick
jerk
of
sheer
awkwardness
he
snatched
a
card
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
her
there
there
my
address
he
cried
and
if
you
only
send
me
the
word
i
jump
off
the
bridge
or
throw
myself
under
a
truck
or
make
any
other
sort
of
reparation
whatever
that
happens
to
occur
to
you
but
he
grinned
i
simply
got
to
get
warm
and
started
down
the
steps
but
before
he
had
quite
reached
the
sidewalk
the
girl
had
overtaken
him
and
placed
a
detaining
hand
on
his
coat
sleeve
how
old
is
she
questioned
the
girl
who
said
the
young
doctor
oh
the
woman
she
old
enough
to
be
your
mother
i
conceded
the
girl
well
she
fifty
affirmed
the
young
doctor
across
the
girl
translucent
face
a
dozen
conflicting
emotions
seemed
surging
suddenly
so
she
laughed
so
she
repeated
experimentally
if
only
you
had
not
been
so
so
she
sighed
well
about
that
piano
she
ventured
with
a
certain
unwonted
shyness
in
a
world
of
so
much
racket
is
it
not
a
pity
that
any
harmonies
should
lie
dumb
is
it
is
it
a
good
piano
she
asked
quite
abruptly
why
for
heaven
sake
how
do
i
know
demanded
the
young
doctor
it
may
be
a
a
stradivarius
he
floundered
wildly
but
it
looks
to
me
like
the
like
the
devil
if
i
could
only
see
it
whispered
the
girl
i
could
tell
in
a
minute
of
course
if
you
could
only
see
it
scoffed
the
young
doctor
then
well
well
why
not
he
acknowledged
a
trifle
tardily
but
with
indisputable
common
sense
i
have
an
aunt
here
mused
the
girl
who
has
a
rheumatism
in
her
elbow
i
think
it
is
on
friday
afternoon
next
if
the
rheumatism
perhaps
should
be
sufficiently
bad
flushed
with
the
anticipatory
ardor
of
a
musician
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
why
capital
acquiesced
the
young
doctor
for
the
instant
the
whole
suggestion
struck
him
as
being
extraordinarily
apt
well
then
he
laughed
until
friday
afternoon
and
vanished
into
the
night
he
was
still
a
long
cold
distance
from
home
but
by
the
time
he
had
finally
reached
there
his
pulses
were
ringing
with
fire
rather
than
with
frost
and
as
soon
as
he
had
started
a
bright
roaring
flame
in
his
stove
and
concocted
for
himself
a
most
luscious
and
steamsome
drink
and
driven
his
frosted
toes
into
the
farthest
corners
of
some
old
fur
slippers
he
sat
right
down
in
a
great
spirit
of
diablerie
to
tell
tome
gallien
just
what
he
thought
of
her
i
hope
you
satisfied
he
began
quite
abruptly
in
a
firm
and
emphatic
black
hand
writing
driven
out
into
the
winter
streets
by
your
most
charming
gift
i
have
in
four
short
hours
walked
eleven
miles
supped
in
a
conspicuous
restaurant
with
a
perfectly
strange
girl
and
at
her
expense
been
branded
publicly
for
all
time
first
as
the
girl
beau
and
later
as
her
husband
and
the
father
of
certain
imaginary
children
and
have
also
in
due
time
still
included
in
the
original
four
hours
you
understand
kissed
said
girl
on
her
own
doorstep
in
the
full
glare
of
a
city
electric
light
and
am
now
at
of
the
aforesaid
monday
evening
waiting
patiently
in
my
room
until
friday
afternoon
next
when
heavily
chaperoned
by
some
kind
of
a
relative
with
rheumatism
the
said
adventure
will
appear
to
investigate
the
piano
and
myself
once
again
in
the
language
of
my
opening
sentence
and
with
all
due
respects
i
repeat
hope
you
satisfied
then
quite
contented
both
in
fancy
and
in
fact
he
settled
down
to
kill
time
and
cure
patients
until
friday
but
the
intervening
days
it
seemed
were
not
to
be
bereft
entirely
of
sensations
either
confusing
or
bizarre
on
wednesday
night
he
heard
from
tome
gallien
and
by
telegram
bungler
wired
tome
gallien
what
in
creation
have
you
done
the
adventure
intended
for
you
does
not
arrive
till
saturday
office
four
the
message
happened
to
be
delivered
in
writing
this
time
a
flaunting
yellow
page
and
still
clutching
it
tight
by
one
twittering
corner
the
young
doctor
dropped
down
into
the
first
chair
he
could
reach
and
with
his
chin
dropped
low
like
an
old
man
on
his
breast
sat
staring
for
an
interminable
time
into
his
glowing
fire
then
quite
suddenly
at
nine
with
the
funny
new
smile
that
he
seemed
to
have
acquired
somewhere
recently
he
walked
over
to
his
telephone
fumbled
a
minute
with
the
directory
experimented
at
least
two
minutes
with
central
temper
located
miss
solvei
kjelland
and
addressed
her
in
his
most
formal
manner
miss
solvei
kjelland
he
questioned
said
the
familiar
voice
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
this
is
doctor
kendrue
he
growled
sam
kendrue
so
conceded
the
voice
without
a
vestige
of
affright
it
seems
miss
kjelland
he
stammered
that
there
has
been
some
sort
of
a
of
a
well
misunderstanding
about
friday
afternoon
it
is
all
a
mistake
it
seems
about
your
being
the
adventure
gallien
indeed
has
just
telegraphed
to
that
effect
the
adventure
it
appears
is
not
due
at
my
office
until
four
on
saturday
conceded
miss
solvei
kjelland
if
she
seemed
to
be
swallowing
rather
extra
hard
once
or
twice
the
sound
was
not
sharply
discernible
certainly
from
the
little
fluttering
swallow
of
the
telephone
instrument
so
she
repeated
blithely
well
that
is
all
right
the
piano
keeps
and
the
saturday
afternoon
is
just
as
good
to
me
as
the
friday
and
i
am
all
as
curious
with
joy
as
you
to
see
what
it
is
this
adventure
that
is
more
nice
than
me
good
night
good
night
admitted
the
young
doctor
ii
that
the
young
doctor
bought
himself
a
new
blue
serge
suit
for
saturday
was
no
indication
whatsoever
that
he
looked
forward
to
that
day
with
any
pleasurable
anticipation
lots
of
people
for
disaster
who
could
even
be
hired
to
brush
their
hair
for
joy
quite
frankly
if
anybody
had
asked
him
about
it
the
young
doctor
would
have
rated
tome
gallien
as
a
disaster
if
pressed
further
for
justification
of
such
a
rating
he
would
have
argued
that
any
rich
woman
who
could
sleep
was
a
disaster
oh
it
all
well
enough
for
poor
people
he
would
have
admitted
to
put
in
the
long
night
watches
mulling
over
the
weird
things
that
they
like
to
do
but
when
a
person
is
actually
able
to
leap
up
at
the
first
gay
crack
of
dawn
and
finance
the
weirdest
fancy
of
his
night
oh
of
course
he
was
honest
enough
to
acknowledge
poor
tome
gallien
would
never
again
while
life
lasted
be
able
to
up
at
hour
of
the
day
or
night
and
she
doubtless
in
her
fifty
eccentric
years
given
extravagantly
to
no
end
of
people
who
had
proved
themselves
the
stingiest
sort
of
receivers
and
her
sense
of
humor
even
in
her
remotest
happiest
youth
must
have
been
of
course
essentially
caustic
but
how
any
woman
could
reach
a
point
so
sick
so
vindictive
so
caustic
so
rich
that
still
unable
to
strip
herself
of
her
lifelong
passion
for
giving
she
should
evolve
the
perfectly
diabolic
idea
of
giving
people
only
the
things
that
they
did
want
only
the
things
indeed
that
she
was
absolutely
positive
they
did
want
such
as
pianos
grand
pianos
huge
rosewood
chunks
of
intricate
mechanism
and
ornate
decoration
and
heaven
knows
what
expense
crammed
down
into
the
meager
crowded
office
of
some
poor
struggling
young
doctor
who
did
know
a
note
from
a
gnat
himself
of
course
being
the
young
doctor
thought
it
was
funny
did
she
thought
it
would
really
drive
him
outdoors
for
sheer
rage
into
some
sort
of
an
enlivening
adventure
that
was
her
theory
was
it
well
it
funny
and
it
driven
him
out
to
meet
a
rather
particularly
enlivening
sort
of
adventure
which
adventure
in
the
person
of
a
miss
solvei
kjelland
was
now
due
at
his
office
by
her
own
insistent
appointment
on
saturday
afternoon
at
four
but
this
miss
solvei
kjelland
it
seems
was
not
the
adventure
which
tome
gallien
had
already
arranged
for
him
for
saturday
afternoon
same
hour
same
place
into
his
muddled
mind
flashed
transiently
a
line
of
a
novel
to
the
effect
heaven
help
the
day
when
the
mate
you
made
for
yourself
and
the
mate
god
made
for
you
happen
to
meet
well
if
it
really
came
to
a
between
his
adventure
and
tome
gallien
quite
unexpectedly
his
mouth
began
suddenly
to
twitch
at
one
corner
speaking
of
caustic
humor
it
was
barely
possible
that
the
young
doctor
had
just
a
tiny
bit
of
caustic
humor
himself
when
a
man
smiles
suddenly
on
one
side
of
his
mouth
it
is
proof
at
least
that
he
sees
the
joke
nobody
ought
to
be
expected
to
smile
on
both
sides
till
he
feels
the
joke
as
well
as
sees
it
certainly
the
poor
young
doctor
was
not
feeling
very
much
of
anything
at
just
this
time
except
a
sense
of
impending
doom
but
in
this
sense
of
impending
doom
flickered
the
one
ray
of
light
that
at
least
he
knew
what
his
own
adventure
was
she
was
young
lithe
blonde
why
as
tall
as
himself
almost
a
trifle
unconventional
perhaps
yes
even
a
good
bit
amazing
but
thoroughly
wholesome
and
human
yes
that
was
just
it
so
deliciously
and
indisputably
human
but
tome
gallien
adventure
a
woman
like
tome
gallien
would
stop
at
anything
it
might
be
a
pair
of
llamas
from
peru
or
a
greasy
to
tell
his
fortune
or
a
homeless
little
pickaninny
with
a
banjo
and
consumption
or
or
an
invitation
even
to
lecture
on
physiology
at
a
girls
school
but
whatever
it
proved
to
be
he
might
just
as
well
realize
now
that
it
would
be
something
that
he
hated
tome
gallien
in
her
present
mood
would
certainly
never
seek
to
lull
him
with
a
glad
as
long
as
she
saw
any
possible
chance
to
rouse
him
with
a
mad
well
he
would
get
mad
yet
anyway
he
promised
himself
with
unwonted
whimsicality
and
if
it
llamas
which
perhaps
on
the
whole
would
be
his
preference
out
of
the
various
possibilities
anticipated
they
would
at
least
judging
from
the
woolly
pictures
in
the
geographies
be
free
from
any
possible
danger
of
barking
their
shins
against
the
sharper
edges
of
the
piano
whereas
a
committee
of
any
size
come
to
request
a
series
of
lectures
on
thus
with
one
form
or
another
of
light
mental
exercise
did
he
try
to
keep
his
brain
clear
and
his
pulse
normal
for
the
approaching
saturday
but
saturday
itself
dawned
neither
clear
nor
normal
rain
snow
slush
wind
had
changed
the
whole
outdoor
world
into
a
blizzard
it
was
one
of
those
days
when
anything
might
blow
in
but
how
in
the
world
would
it
ever
blow
out
again
with
this
threat
of
eternity
added
to
uncertainty
the
young
doctor
decided
quite
impulsively
to
dust
his
desk
and
investigate
his
to
his
infinite
relief
he
found
at
least
very
little
food
in
the
whatever
happened
it
could
not
possibly
prove
a
very
long
siege
a
half
pound
of
butter
a
box
of
rusks
a
can
of
coffee
six
or
seven
eggs
divided
up
among
any
kind
of
a
committee
or
even
between
two
llamas
at
the
increasing
excitability
of
his
fancies
he
determined
very
suddenly
to
sober
himself
with
hard
reading
with
this
intent
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
his
breakfast
he
took
down
from
his
bookcase
a
very
erudite
treatise
on
the
bony
ankylosis
of
the
temporomandibular
joint
and
proceeded
to
devote
himself
to
it
now
here
was
something
serious
thoroughly
serious
science
heaven
be
praised
for
science
by
noon
indeed
he
was
so
absorbed
in
the
bony
ankylosis
of
the
temporomandibular
joint
that
he
quite
forgot
about
luncheon
and
at
three
he
looked
down
with
a
glance
of
surprise
to
see
that
the
toes
of
his
boots
were
dipping
into
a
tiny
rivulet
which
seemed
flowing
to
him
from
the
farther
side
of
the
room
by
craning
his
neck
around
the
corner
of
the
piano
he
noted
with
increasing
astonishment
that
the
rivulet
sprang
essentially
from
the
black
ferule
of
an
umbrella
and
that
just
beyond
the
dripping
black
ferule
of
that
umbrella
was
the
dripping
black
ferule
of
another
umbrella
and
beyond
that
still
an
other
jumping
joyously
to
his
feet
he
made
three
apologies
in
one
to
the
group
that
loomed
up
before
him
why
i
beg
your
pardon
he
began
to
the
wheezy
old
man
who
sat
nearest
him
really
i
i
had
no
idea
he
explained
painstakingly
to
the
small
freckled
boy
just
beyond
with
all
this
wind
and
everything
and
the
way
the
rain
rattles
against
the
window
he
stammered
to
the
woman
in
the
far
corner
none
of
these
was
presumably
tome
adventure
but
it
was
surely
adventure
enough
of
itself
on
the
old
oak
settle
where
almost
no
one
ever
sat
even
on
pleasant
days
to
behold
three
patients
sitting
crowded
and
in
a
blizzard
i
was
so
absorbed
in
my
book
he
boasted
with
sudden
nonchalance
oh
that
all
right
sir
wheezed
the
old
man
i
was
just
waitin
for
a
car
and
it
looked
drier
in
here
than
where
i
was
standin
outdoors
illustration
by
craning
his
neck
around
the
corner
of
the
piano
he
noted
with
increasing
astonishment
that
the
rivulet
sprang
from
the
black
ferule
of
an
umbrella
and
say
mister
do
you
pull
teeth
questioned
the
small
freckled
boy
but
the
lady
was
a
real
patient
though
goodness
knows
the
young
doctor
would
gladly
have
drawn
either
the
old
man
or
the
small
boy
in
her
place
all
his
life
long
he
had
particularly
disapproved
of
mourning
it
was
false
spiritually
he
thought
it
was
bad
psychologically
everybody
knew
of
course
that
it
was
unwise
hygienically
but
worst
of
anything
perhaps
the
woman
before
him
now
made
him
think
of
a
damp
black
cat
it
was
perfectly
evident
however
that
the
lady
herself
cherished
no
such
unpleasant
with
perfect
complacency
at
his
request
she
came
forward
to
the
light
or
at
least
to
such
light
as
the
window
allowed
and
still
swathed
as
blackly
from
view
as
any
harem
lady
stated
her
case
i
have
such
a
pain
here
she
pointed
with
hand
toward
her
face
did
she
also
take
him
for
a
tooth
puller
mused
the
young
doctor
with
all
haste
he
sought
to
settle
the
matter
at
once
if
you
will
kindly
remove
your
er
bonnet
is
it
that
you
call
it
he
asked
compliantly
the
unpleasant
hands
busied
themselves
for
a
moment
with
pin
or
knot
until
emerging
slowly
from
its
dank
black
draperies
there
lifted
at
last
to
the
young
gasping
stare
the
most
young
brunette
face
that
he
had
ever
seen
outside
a
salon
catalogue
here
just
here
is
the
pain
pointed
the
finger
to
a
spot
right
in
front
of
the
most
absurd
little
ear
bony
ankylosis
of
the
temporomandibular
joint
gasped
the
young
doctor
just
like
a
swear
even
as
scientifically
as
he
touched
the
he
felt
his
own
wrist
wobble
most
unscientifically
with
the
contact
it
was
no
wonder
perhaps
that
the
dark
eyes
before
him
dilated
with
a
vague
sort
of
alarm
is
it
is
it
as
bad
as
that
faltered
his
patient
why
it
is
that
at
all
hastened
the
young
doctor
with
a
sudden
resumption
of
sagacity
it
probably
just
a
sort
of
rheumatism
what
made
me
cry
out
so
was
just
a
mere
funny
coincidence
this
particular
kind
of
pain
being
a
subject
that
i
that
i
if
i
may
say
so
have
been
giving
rather
special
attention
to
lately
oh
then
i
trust
that
i
have
come
to
just
the
right
person
smiled
the
dark
eyes
with
a
kindling
that
seemed
nevertheless
quite
frankly
bereft
of
any
special
inner
enthusiasm
we
will
certainly
hope
so
flushed
the
young
doctor
how
about
this
pain
he
began
quite
abruptly
it
hurts
me
when
i
eat
said
the
girl
her
voice
was
very
low
and
soft
and
drawling
and
when
i
drink
and
when
i
talk
she
confided
but
especially
when
i
sing
oh
you
sing
questioned
the
young
doctor
yes
said
the
girl
for
the
first
time
her
classic
immobile
little
face
was
quick
with
a
very
modern
emotion
personally
confessed
the
young
doctor
i
should
like
very
much
to
try
a
little
experiment
on
you
if
you
do
mind
it
will
help
me
even
if
it
hurts
you
as
you
wish
acquiesced
the
girl
with
the
same
imperturbable
little
smile
from
his
precipitous
retreat
into
the
other
room
he
returned
after
due
delay
with
a
plate
of
rusks
and
a
steaming
hot
cup
of
coffee
it
such
a
horrid
day
he
said
and
you
look
so
wet
and
cold
perhaps
a
taste
of
coffee
would
come
in
altogether
amiss
but
it
these
rusks
that
i
really
interested
in
i
want
you
to
bite
down
hard
on
them
and
then
presently
perhaps
i
will
ask
you
to
sing
so
that
i
may
watch
the
oh
by
the
way
he
interrupted
himself
irrelevantly
i
neglected
i
think
to
ask
your
name
my
name
said
the
girl
is
kendrue
what
questioned
the
young
doctor
why
that
is
my
name
he
smiled
yes
i
know
murmured
the
girl
coincidences
of
that
sort
are
certainly
very
strange
it
was
one
of
the
first
things
my
aunt
spoke
of
when
i
asked
her
advice
about
what
physician
to
go
to
i
am
a
comparative
stranger
in
the
city
she
added
a
bit
shiveringly
but
did
my
aunt
tell
you
i
was
coming
she
quickened
suddenly
did
my
aunt
tome
gallien
write
you
or
something
that
i
was
coming
tome
gallien
jumped
the
young
doctor
chaotically
through
his
senses
quickened
a
dozen
new
angers
a
dozen
new
resentments
a
girl
so
this
was
tome
gallien
threatened
adventure
was
it
of
all
the
spiteful
possibilities
in
the
world
now
this
just
like
the
amiable
lady
in
question
to
foist
another
girl
into
a
situation
quite
sufficiently
embarrassed
with
girl
as
it
was
is
is
tome
gallien
your
aunt
he
demanded
with
such
sudden
stentorious
sternness
that
even
the
most
bona
fide
would
hardly
have
acquiesced
without
pausing
an
instant
to
reconsider
the
matter
well
not
of
course
not
exactly
a
real
aunt
admitted
the
girl
but
i
have
always
called
her
my
aunt
we
have
always
been
very
intimate
or
rather
perhaps
i
should
say
she
had
always
been
very
very
kind
to
me
and
now
since
my
father
with
the
unmistakable
air
of
one
who
strives
suddenly
to
suppress
an
almost
overwhelming
emotion
she
pointed
irrelevantly
to
the
piano
and
waved
off
the
plate
of
rusks
and
the
cup
of
coffee
which
the
young
doctor
still
stood
proffering
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
if
i
seem
distrait
she
stammered
but
in
addition
to
the
very
real
annoyance
that
this
little
pain
in
my
jaw
is
giving
me
i
am
i
am
so
bewildered
about
that
piano
where
did
you
get
it
she
asked
quite
bluntly
why
it
came
from
warerooms
i
believe
admitted
the
young
doctor
with
as
much
frankness
as
he
could
summon
at
the
moment
with
a
little
soft
sigh
the
girl
reached
out
and
touched
the
dark
gleaming
woodwork
i
thought
so
she
whispered
and
oh
how
you
must
love
it
it
is
certainly
the
most
beautiful
instrument
that
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
the
most
melodious
i
mean
the
most
nearly
perfect
an
utter
miracle
of
tone
and
flexibility
as
an
accompanist
to
the
human
voice
u
m
mmmm
said
the
young
doctor
for
two
months
persisted
the
girl
i
have
been
haunting
the
warerooms
you
speak
of
for
two
months
i
have
been
moving
heaven
and
earth
in
an
effort
to
possess
it
but
my
means
being
temporarily
tied
up
she
shivered
again
ever
so
slightly
i
was
not
able
immediately
to
with
that
odd
inert
little
smile
she
reached
out
for
the
plate
of
rusks
and
took
one
as
the
young
doctor
had
requested
yes
here
is
the
pain
she
explained
conscientiously
but
only
last
week
she
winced
on
my
birthday
it
was
i
had
every
reason
in
the
world
to
believe
that
tome
gallien
was
going
to
give
the
piano
to
me
she
has
given
me
so
many
wonderful
things
but
she
sent
me
instead
the
deed
to
a
duck
blind
down
somewhere
on
the
south
carolina
coast
shooting
you
know
and
dreadful
guns
and
dogs
and
all
that
i
who
would
even
hurt
a
sparrow
or
scare
a
kitten
with
his
hands
clapped
to
his
head
the
young
doctor
swung
around
suddenly
and
started
for
the
window
was
this
a
comic
opera
a
farce
a
phantasy
of
not
enough
work
and
too
much
worry
was
every
mention
of
tome
gallien
name
to
be
a
as
long
as
life
lasted
as
long
as
startled
by
a
tiny
gasp
he
turned
to
find
his
little
visitor
convulsed
with
tears
but
still
struggling
bravely
to
regain
her
oh
please
do
think
i
always
as
as
weak
as
this
she
pleaded
through
her
sobs
but
with
pain
and
disappointment
and
everything
happening
so
all
at
once
and
with
my
big
loss
so
recent
how
long
ago
did
you
lose
your
father
asked
the
young
doctor
very
gently
my
father
stammered
the
girl
white
now
as
the
death
she
mourned
she
lifted
her
stricken
face
to
his
why
it
father
i
was
talking
about
she
gasped
it
was
my
husband
your
husband
cried
the
young
doctor
two
minutes
ago
was
the
situation
that
he
had
cursed
out
as
a
farce
a
comic
opera
this
poor
stricken
exquisite
heartbroken
little
widow
tagged
out
by
tome
gallien
as
an
adventure
and
foisted
on
his
attention
like
some
gay
new
kind
of
a
practical
joke
it
was
outrageous
he
fumed
inexcusably
brutal
colorado
is
where
it
happened
he
had
to
bend
his
head
to
hear
almost
a
year
and
a
half
ago
strangled
the
poor
little
voice
and
we
had
been
married
a
year
lung
trouble
it
was
something
dreadfully
acute
tome
gallien
did
everything
she
always
done
everything
it
something
about
my
father
i
think
oh
ages
and
ages
ago
they
were
lovers
it
seems
but
but
she
chose
to
make
a
worldier
marriage
and
later
my
father
why
she
bought
my
whole
trousseau
for
me
suffered
the
sweet
voice
afresh
went
to
paris
herself
for
it
i
mean
across
the
young
doctor
memory
a
single
chance
sentence
came
flashing
back
the
daughter
of
a
man
who
once
meant
something
to
me
in
my
youth
so
this
was
the
girl
the
little
stingy
receiver
among
all
tome
gallien
stingy
receivers
the
one
unquenchable
pang
in
an
otherwise
reasonably
callous
side
precious
undoubtedly
poignant
eternally
significant
yet
always
and
forever
the
flesh
that
was
not
of
her
flesh
nor
the
spirit
quite
of
her
spirit
familiar
eyes
perhaps
an
alien
mouth
a
dimple
that
had
no
right
possibly
haunting
a
lean
loved
cheek
line
fire
flame
ice
ashes
a
torch
to
memory
a
scorch
to
hope
but
whose
smile
was
it
anyway
that
maddeningly
casual
and
inconsequent
little
thank
you
smile
searing
its
way
apparently
with
equal
impartiality
across
chiffon
or
crape
a
proffered
chair
or
eagerest
promise
of
relief
from
pain
had
tome
gallien
life
by
chance
gone
on
just
that
smile
and
why
in
heaven
name
if
people
loved
each
other
did
they
let
anything
wreck
them
and
back
of
that
what
did
people
want
to
love
each
other
for
anyway
what
good
was
it
all
this
old
fretting
its
new
path
now
all
over
again
into
at
the
very
taste
of
the
phrase
his
mind
jumped
out
of
its
reverie
and
back
to
the
one
real
question
at
hand
if
you
please
now
he
implored
his
visitor
just
a
little
of
the
coffee
just
a
crunch
or
two
of
the
rusk
urgently
as
he
spoke
he
began
proffering
first
one
and
then
the
other
and
this
crying
he
persisted
does
this
also
hurt
you
from
the
doorway
beyond
him
he
sensed
suddenly
the
low
sound
of
footsteps
and
looked
up
into
solvei
kjelland
laughing
face
blue
as
a
larkspur
in
a
summer
crisp
shimmery
sparkling
with
frost
even
her
blonde
hair
tucked
into
a
storm
hat
she
stood
there
shaking
a
reproachful
finger
at
both
the
young
doctor
and
his
patient
oh
ho
for
what
a
pity
she
laughed
if
you
had
but
told
me
that
tome
gallien
adventure
was
to
be
a
picnic
then
i
also
could
have
brought
the
food
illustration
excuse
me
miss
kjelland
he
said
but
this
is
not
a
picnic
it
is
a
clinic
picnic
frowned
the
young
doctor
before
the
plaintive
bewilderment
in
the
dark
eyes
that
lifted
at
just
that
instant
to
his
an
unwonted
severity
crisped
into
his
voice
excuse
me
miss
kjelland
he
said
but
this
is
not
a
picnic
it
is
a
clinic
so
who
is
a
clinic
cried
solvei
kjelland
perfectly
undaunted
and
swished
bluely
forward
to
join
them
it
is
not
of
course
of
a
propriety
doctor
kendrue
she
laughed
that
i
should
come
thus
without
the
sick
aunt
but
in
a
storm
so
unwholesome
for
aunt
is
it
not
best
that
i
buy
some
good
medicine
in
a
shimmer
of
melting
snowflakes
she
perched
herself
on
the
arm
of
the
first
chair
she
could
reach
and
extracting
the
familiar
little
purse
from
her
big
blue
pocket
handed
the
young
doctor
a
bill
medicine
for
the
sick
aunt
she
commandeered
gaily
then
with
only
the
most
casual
glance
at
the
piano
she
whirled
around
to
scrutinize
the
desolate
little
figure
before
her
if
she
noticed
the
tears
she
certainly
gave
no
sign
of
it
ah
it
is
as
i
thought
she
triumphed
most
surely
in
my
mind
did
i
say
that
you
would
be
a
girl
in
one
sweeping
glance
she
seemed
to
be
appraising
suddenly
every
individual
tone
and
feature
of
the
dark
exquisite
little
face
that
lifted
so
bewilderedly
to
hers
then
quite
unexpectedly
a
most
twinkling
smile
flickered
across
her
own
sharply
contrasted
blondeness
and
like
a
fine
friendly
child
she
held
out
her
hand
in
greeting
most
certainly
she
conceded
you
are
more
cute
than
i
but
also
in
some
ways
she
beamed
i
am
of
course
more
cute
than
you
while
the
young
doctor
waited
for
the
skies
to
fall
he
saw
instead
to
his
infinite
amazement
that
the
little
brunette
though
still
bewildered
was
returning
the
handshake
with
unquestionable
cordiality
awfully
women
were
like
that
he
reasoned
quickly
no
matter
how
totally
disorganized
they
might
be
by
silly
things
like
mice
or
toads
you
simply
could
faze
them
when
it
came
to
a
purely
social
emergency
and
in
a
situation
which
had
thus
precipitously
reached
a
point
so
hopelessly
there
seemed
after
all
but
one
thing
left
for
him
to
do
miss
kjelland
he
essayed
with
a
really
terrifying
formality
this
is
mrs
kendrue
the
instant
the
phrase
had
left
his
lips
his
very
ears
were
crimsoning
with
the
one
possible
implication
which
miss
solvei
kjelland
would
draw
from
such
an
announcement
and
more
than
any
woman
would
have
been
with
a
mouse
he
turned
and
fled
for
his
medicine
cabinet
in
the
very
farthest
corner
of
the
room
your
wife
faltered
solvei
kjelland
in
frank
astonishment
she
laughed
and
i
have
only
just
come
mix
me
a
quarter
worth
more
of
the
good
medicine
mr
doctor
she
called
back
over
her
shoulder
and
dropped
down
on
the
low
stool
at
the
other
girl
feet
now
about
this
piano
she
began
precipitously
i
am
not
doctor
kendrue
wife
protested
the
little
black
figure
bewilderedly
why
why
i
thought
you
were
his
wife
she
confided
with
increasing
confusion
from
the
direction
of
the
medicine
cabinet
the
sound
of
some
one
choking
was
distinctly
audible
both
girls
rose
instinctively
to
meet
only
the
young
doctor
perfectly
inscrutable
face
who
now
is
eating
a
miss
beamed
solvei
kendrue
is
a
patient
of
mine
affirmed
the
young
doctor
with
some
coldness
conceded
the
norse
girl
with
equal
coldness
a
patient
that
is
most
nice
but
as
though
suddenly
muddled
all
over
again
by
this
latest
biographical
announcement
she
threw
out
her
hands
with
a
frank
gesture
of
despair
if
this
should
be
a
patient
she
implored
who
then
is
the
adventure
behind
the
little
black
figure
back
the
young
doctor
lifted
a
quick
warning
finger
to
his
lips
he
signaled
beseechingly
to
her
on
solvei
kjelland
forehead
the
incongruous
frown
deepened
from
perplexity
into
something
very
like
impatience
well
certainly
she
attested
you
are
of
a
great
sobriety
in
your
office
but
most
wild
on
the
doorstep
as
for
me
she
confided
it
is
of
the
piano
and
the
piano
only
that
i
care
that
just
it
said
the
young
doctor
it
is
of
the
piano
and
the
piano
only
that
kendrue
cares
with
her
already
touching
the
ivory
keys
the
norse
girl
swung
sharply
around
what
is
that
she
demanded
with
a
sudden
impish
conviction
that
tome
gallien
being
already
responsible
for
so
many
awkward
situations
in
the
world
might
just
as
well
now
be
responsible
for
everything
the
young
doctor
gathered
breath
for
his
latest
announcement
kendrue
he
smiled
with
studied
calm
is
the
niece
as
it
were
of
the
lady
who
gave
me
the
piano
what
stammered
both
girls
in
a
single
breath
but
it
was
the
little
widow
turn
this
time
to
be
the
most
dumfounded
what
she
repeated
with
a
vague
new
sort
of
pain
what
you
mean
that
tome
gallien
gave
the
piano
when
when
she
knew
how
i
had
been
longing
for
it
all
these
months
been
haunting
the
warerooms
day
after
day
she
explained
plaintively
over
her
black
shoulder
to
the
other
girl
why
why
do
love
music
so
she
demanded
with
sudden
vehement
passion
of
the
young
doctor
are
you
a
real
musician
i
mean
on
the
contrary
bowed
the
young
doctor
i
am
as
about
pianos
as
you
are
about
ducks
nothing
under
heaven
would
induce
me
to
lay
my
rough
desecrating
hand
upon
a
piano
in
an
impulse
of
common
humanity
he
turned
to
allay
the
new
bewilderment
in
solvei
kjelland
face
this
allusion
about
ducks
he
explained
concerns
another
little
idiosyncrasy
of
tome
gallien
yes
quickened
the
little
widow
when
she
sent
doctor
kendrue
this
wonderful
piano
she
sent
me
a
a
dreadful
duck
blind
way
down
somewhere
in
south
carolina
what
is
that
puzzled
solvei
kjelland
why
a
place
to
shoot
snapped
the
young
doctor
wild
ducks
you
know
a
a
sporting
camp
his
whole
face
was
suddenly
alight
and
this
little
kendrue
does
not
sport
reflected
solvei
in
another
instant
her
own
face
was
all
alight
too
oh
of
what
a
nonsense
she
laughed
of
what
a
silliness
it
is
of
course
a
mistake
most
funny
most
conflictable
in
some
way
it
is
that
the
gifts
should
get
mixed
in
the
mails
oh
no
wagged
the
young
doctor
head
oh
no
he
reiterated
with
some
emphasis
careless
as
i
assure
you
many
of
the
are
there
is
very
little
likelihood
of
a
grand
piano
and
a
duck
blind
getting
mixed
in
the
mails
subsided
the
norse
girl
but
only
for
an
instant
what
my
idea
should
be
she
resumed
cheerfully
and
what
the
idea
of
my
aunt
should
be
is
that
if
you
would
let
us
take
the
piano
one
month
two
months
three
we
would
in
return
give
you
some
lessons
in
this
music
either
in
the
piano
or
of
the
vocal
said
the
young
doctor
yes
yes
of
course
that
would
undoubtedly
be
very
humanizing
and
all
that
but
with
so
much
unexpected
competition
as
it
were
one
must
move
very
er
slowly
in
the
matter
just
what
just
what
would
be
your
idea
mrs
kendrue
he
turned
and
asked
quite
abruptly
my
idea
flushed
the
little
widow
why
why
of
course
i
did
have
any
idea
because
i
did
even
know
that
you
possessed
the
piano
until
just
now
but
if
you
are
still
willing
to
part
with
it
after
after
the
estate
is
settled
she
hurried
with
evident
emotion
why
then
perhaps
i
yearningly
as
she
spoke
she
stepped
forward
to
the
piano
and
fingered
out
one
chord
after
another
soft
vibrant
experimental
achingly
minor
a
timid
delicate
nature
whole
unconscious
appeal
to
life
for
help
love
tenderness
dear
me
mused
the
young
doctor
oh
do
you
play
cried
solvei
kjelland
ecstatically
oh
no
deprecated
the
little
widow
i
just
sing
do
sing
she
in
turn
demanded
as
though
her
very
heart
jumped
with
the
question
oh
no
said
solvei
kjelland
i
just
play
yearningly
she
in
turn
stepped
forward
and
struck
a
single
chord
but
there
was
nothing
soft
or
minor
about
this
one
chord
sharp
clear
stirring
as
a
clarion
call
it
rang
out
through
the
dingy
room
oh
dear
thought
the
young
doctor
and
as
though
flaming
then
and
there
with
the
musical
fervor
so
long
suppressed
the
norse
girl
swung
impetuously
round
upon
her
companion
you
do
not
play
and
i
do
not
sing
so
let
us
she
cried
excitedly
and
dropping
down
on
the
piano
stool
seemed
literally
melting
her
fluent
into
and
melody
indefinitely
for
a
brilliant
chaotic
moment
or
two
chord
heaped
upon
chord
and
harmony
upon
harmony
and
then
suddenly
to
the
young
doctor
musically
untutored
mind
it
seemed
as
though
the
crashing
waves
of
sound
were
literally
parting
on
either
side
to
let
a
little
tune
come
through
and
such
a
pleasant
familiar
tune
he
rated
it
delightedly
he
remember
that
verdi
wrote
it
he
did
stop
to
consider
that
it
was
from
trovatore
all
he
cared
was
that
it
was
a
tune
and
a
tune
that
said
things
and
a
tune
that
always
said
the
same
things
whether
you
heard
it
chopped
through
a
on
an
asphalt
pavement
or
roared
stentoriously
by
a
band
at
the
beach
home
to
our
mountains
was
what
it
said
and
oh
other
things
too
undoubtedly
but
that
was
all
that
really
mattered
home
to
our
mountains
it
was
perfectly
evident
though
that
the
little
widow
cared
who
wrote
it
and
what
it
was
from
and
where
it
was
going
to
with
thrilling
sweetness
astonishing
technique
and
most
amazing
volume
her
rich
contralto
voice
rang
suddenly
through
the
room
and
in
the
precipitous
jump
of
his
heart
was
it
any
wonder
that
the
poor
young
doctor
could
have
told
for
the
life
of
him
whether
the
mischief
was
all
in
one
girl
voice
or
another
girl
or
partly
in
the
voice
and
partly
in
the
or
home
to
our
mountains
soared
the
lovely
voice
then
quivered
suddenly
like
some
wounded
thing
and
with
her
hands
pressed
tightly
to
her
cheek
the
little
singer
sank
weakly
down
in
the
first
chair
she
could
reach
why
what
is
it
jumped
the
young
doctor
through
a
haze
of
tears
the
dark
eyes
lifted
to
his
oh
nothing
special
faltered
the
little
singer
just
everything
with
an
irrelevant
crash
of
chords
solvei
kjelland
swung
sharply
round
from
the
piano
who
is
this
tome
gallien
anyways
she
demanded
fiercely
and
where
is
her
habit
and
what
good
is
she
to
hold
back
from
people
thus
the
things
they
want
and
stuff
them
all
with
what
they
do
want
it
is
a
scandal
i
say
it
is
a
monstrosity
with
a
quick
jerky
sort
of
defiance
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
commenced
straightening
her
blue
hat
and
tightening
up
her
blue
collar
i
am
a
failure
as
one
adventure
she
laughed
and
i
also
get
nothing
neither
the
piano
nor
the
medicine
for
the
sick
aunt
give
me
the
address
of
this
woman
she
demanded
and
i
will
write
to
her
in
my
leisure
and
tell
her
what
my
thoughts
of
her
should
be
do
urged
the
young
doctor
nothing
would
please
her
more
when
a
woman
has
the
ego
that
tome
gallien
has
nothing
in
the
world
that
tickles
her
vanity
so
as
to
hear
just
what
people
think
of
her
be
it
good
bad
or
indifferent
with
deliberate
malice
he
tore
a
leaf
from
his
notebook
scribbled
the
desired
address
on
it
and
handed
it
to
the
norse
girl
if
it
does
do
anything
else
he
commended
her
with
mock
gravity
it
may
at
least
draw
the
fire
the
fire
repeated
the
norse
girl
a
bit
perplexedly
then
as
though
to
shrug
all
perplexity
aside
she
turned
suddenly
to
the
young
widow
as
for
you
she
beamed
you
are
a
cunning
little
thing
and
i
loves
you
with
unmistakable
tenderness
she
stooped
and
kissed
the
astonished
little
singer
on
the
forehead
and
i
hope
you
will
soon
be
of
a
perfect
wellness
she
coaxed
and
sing
the
perfectly
whole
songs
to
whatever
piano
it
is
that
you
should
love
the
best
as
for
me
she
called
briskly
to
the
young
doctor
it
is
that
you
understand
i
am
perfectly
resigned
resigned
to
what
frowned
the
young
doctor
oh
this
language
laughed
solvei
do
you
know
your
own
words
to
of
it
is
the
that
i
would
say
complete
the
adventure
i
am
resigned
warned
the
young
doctor
frowning
face
once
more
almost
anxiously
he
accompanied
her
to
the
door
he
implored
her
the
poor
little
girl
must
never
know
of
tome
gallien
audacity
in
sending
her
here
as
an
with
all
the
sorrow
she
in
just
now
and
the
pain
yes
quite
so
acquiesced
solvei
kjelland
with
perfect
docility
then
all
of
a
flutter
in
the
open
doorway
she
turned
to
call
back
her
blithe
doctor
and
mrs
kendrue
she
called
what
she
flushed
at
the
very
evident
consternation
in
both
uplifted
faces
then
and
doctor
kendrue
she
revised
her
adieus
hastily
she
flared
with
her
first
real
sign
of
impatience
well
then
and
doctor
kendrue
she
finished
triumphantly
and
vanished
into
the
snowstorm
turning
back
to
his
somber
office
and
his
sad
little
patient
it
seemed
suddenly
to
the
young
doctor
as
though
the
first
blue
bird
had
fled
leaving
only
a
single
black
iris
bud
to
presage
spring
for
the
garden
blue
birds
were
darlings
quickened
the
young
doctor
and
yet
poignantly
to
his
memory
revived
a
misty
may
time
years
and
years
ago
when
he
had
sat
in
the
grass
a
whole
day
through
to
watch
the
unfolding
miracle
of
a
black
iris
bud
in
consideration
of
the
particular
speed
and
energy
which
solvei
kjelland
applied
that
afternoon
to
her
homeward
plunge
through
jostling
traffic
and
resonant
subways
it
is
of
interest
to
note
that
the
first
thing
she
did
on
reaching
her
room
was
to
sit
right
down
in
her
coat
and
hat
and
investigate
the
word
leisure
in
her
english
dictionary
out
of
all
the
various
definitions
given
vacancy
of
mind
seemed
to
suit
her
fancy
best
in
the
vacancy
of
my
mind
is
it
that
i
have
promised
for
this
writing
she
questioned
of
a
very
good
wellness
then
when
else
should
my
mind
or
my
heart
be
more
vacated
than
now
true
to
this
impulse
she
sat
down
that
very
evening
to
tell
tome
gallien
just
exactly
what
she
thought
of
her
on
some
very
pale
pale
yellow
note
paper
with
the
blue
ink
which
she
adored
and
in
the
spirited
handwriting
so
characteristic
of
her
nationality
the
very
page
was
a
blonde
flare
of
personality
tome
gallien
dearest
madam
she
wrote
how
do
you
do
and
i
know
all
do
not
do
it
i
say
do
not
do
it
they
do
not
like
it
and
if
you
so
persist
in
thus
teasing
of
them
you
will
most
certainly
defeat
the
one
object
which
i
am
of
an
inclination
to
suspect
that
you
have
tucked
away
in
one
side
of
the
mind
is
it
not
so
you
are
of
course
very
clever
and
of
much
wealthiness
and
some
pain
and
it
is
of
course
very
diverting
and
most
droll
lying
thus
to
plan
how
one
may
yet
motivate
the
destinies
is
it
that
you
say
and
it
is
doubtless
as
you
well
think
the
little
widow
lady
has
mourned
too
long
and
is
too
delicate
of
the
indoors
and
moons
too
much
over
the
and
this
young
doctor
in
his
own
turn
he
also
is
a
mistake
so
sarcasms
so
severe
and
hates
all
womans
and
all
pianos
both
except
for
minutes
and
you
have
thought
that
if
thus
across
the
little
pain
in
the
lady
bone
these
two
could
be
brought
to
scold
about
the
pianos
and
the
blind
ducks
much
good
might
yet
come
and
of
a
most
loving
adjustingment
but
no
madam
it
is
a
great
mistake
these
people
are
not
at
all
as
bright
as
you
think
and
also
in
their
hearts
is
there
none
of
that
most
happy
greed
which
makes
all
comical
things
as
they
come
one
joke
no
it
is
only
that
they
see
in
your
gifts
one
great
which
if
you
persist
in
so
doing
with
other
comics
will
make
them
cold
with
hate
and
humiliation
for
each
other
and
when
you
tag
the
poor
little
lady
as
an
adventure
you
have
yet
outraged
complete
the
chivalries
of
the
young
doctor
so
that
he
can
not
even
see
in
his
sense
that
even
so
little
a
widow
may
yet
be
a
very
great
adventure
do
not
do
it
i
say
do
not
do
it
it
is
cruel
and
there
is
no
law
but
your
own
honor
that
can
stop
it
if
the
malice
is
so
formed
that
you
can
not
stop
it
but
must
persist
in
this
most
foolish
custom
of
giving
people
the
things
what
they
do
not
want
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
you
send
them
to
me
i
am
young
i
am
strong
and
very
laughing
if
you
can
find
anything
in
the
world
at
just
this
time
that
i
do
not
want
dare
you
to
send
it
to
me
yours
very
truly
solvei
kjelland
being
satiate
then
with
justice
and
the
english
language
solvei
reverted
once
more
to
the
pursuit
of
juvenile
pedagogics
and
the
general
discussion
of
human
events
with
her
own
aunt
and
in
her
own
tongue
sunday
monday
tuesday
wednesday
nothing
except
pedagogics
and
the
aunt
even
remotely
threatened
her
horizon
and
by
thursday
every
gesture
of
her
fine
young
body
every
changing
expression
of
her
fine
young
face
seemed
frankly
indicative
of
some
seething
inner
triumph
that
as
yet
remained
unspoken
by
friday
night
however
even
this
slipped
its
leash
and
she
closed
her
eyes
for
sleep
with
a
very
distinct
and
definite
expression
of
emotion
ah
she
laughed
that
gallien
lady
down
yonder
is
good
and
fixed
yes
it
was
not
until
saturday
night
late
by
special
delivery
that
tome
gallien
answer
came
stumbling
sleepily
down
the
stairs
just
be
fore
midnight
to
answer
the
doorbell
that
no
one
else
seemed
awake
to
answer
solvei
kjelland
received
the
insignificant
looking
envelope
into
her
own
hands
small
as
it
was
heavily
overshadowed
by
special
delivery
postage
and
almost
quaveringly
directed
in
a
pale
fine
writing
it
might
well
have
suggested
to
anybody
a
suppliant
for
mercy
or
at
least
for
pity
with
a
first
faint
twinge
of
remorse
solvei
tore
it
open
to
discover
no
contents
whatever
except
a
railroad
ticket
to
the
little
mainland
town
in
south
carolina
where
tome
gallien
had
established
her
official
address
scowlingly
for
a
moment
and
in
dumb
perplexity
the
girl
stood
shifting
from
one
slippered
foot
to
another
in
a
really
desperate
effort
to
decipher
each
word
phrase
comma
asterisk
in
the
momentous
little
document
be
fore
her
then
quite
suddenly
a
smile
that
was
by
no
means
mirthful
flashed
brilliantly
across
her
blue
eyes
and
her
gleaming
teeth
said
solvei
kjelland
and
gathering
her
big
gray
blanket
wrapper
a
little
bit
closer
around
her
fled
back
precipitously
to
her
bed
with
the
first
faint
ray
of
morning
light
perhaps
she
might
have
waked
to
an
instant
reassuring
conviction
that
the
whole
ticket
episode
was
a
dream
if
only
her
subconscious
deductions
from
that
episode
had
not
waked
first
on
her
lips
like
a
wry
taste
the
one
things
in
the
world
that
i
did
not
want
at
just
this
time
that
lady
is
a
witchess
was
the
phrase
that
waked
on
her
lips
it
was
not
until
early
the
following
week
however
that
she
called
up
the
young
doctor
to
tell
him
the
news
how
do
you
do
she
telephoned
this
is
solvei
kjelland
and
i
am
to
say
why
what
do
you
mean
questioned
the
young
frankly
surprised
voice
it
is
that
i
am
going
away
said
solvei
on
a
little
what
it
is
you
would
call
a
trip
oh
said
the
young
doctor
where
if
the
statement
could
ever
be
made
that
a
person
shrugged
his
voice
solvei
certainly
shrugged
hers
oh
through
the
tunnel
she
said
and
then
off
yes
but
where
persisted
the
young
doctor
oh
to
the
southern
carolines
to
visit
this
tome
gallien
the
girl
as
one
who
had
rehearsed
the
line
even
to
the
point
of
monotony
what
cried
the
young
doctor
why
why
what
do
you
mean
mean
bridled
solvei
instantly
for
why
should
it
be
a
meanness
is
not
this
tome
gallien
as
fine
a
lady
as
i
am
i
not
as
fine
a
lady
as
tome
gallien
for
why
if
two
ladies
like
to
visit
it
should
not
be
so
have
i
not
explain
it
all
to
the
sick
aunt
yes
but
do
you
really
mean
that
you
wrote
to
tome
gallien
stammered
the
young
doctor
what
did
you
say
for
heaven
sake
what
did
you
say
what
i
did
say
should
be
sealed
in
my
own
heart
affirmed
solvei
with
some
coldness
yes
but
my
dear
child
protested
the
young
doctor
you
seem
to
have
any
idea
of
just
what
you
going
to
it
not
at
all
a
cheerful
sort
of
place
you
understand
why
even
its
name
you
know
is
of
the
sea
even
so
said
solvei
there
is
no
special
pain
in
that
in
my
time
have
i
not
already
seen
several
glooms
of
the
land
why
then
should
i
not
for
sheer
geography
start
out
to
investigate
a
of
the
sea
yes
but
it
a
it
a
desert
island
you
know
persisted
the
young
doctor
brightened
solvei
and
will
there
then
be
camels
with
a
soft
sigh
of
regret
her
whole
personality
seemed
to
fade
for
a
moment
into
the
indeterminate
blur
and
buzz
of
crossed
telephone
wires
then
clear
as
a
bell
her
voice
rang
out
again
and
have
you
seen
the
little
sad
lady
once
more
she
asked
why
she
here
in
my
office
now
said
the
young
doctor
she
has
to
come
almost
every
day
so
mused
the
norse
girl
and
will
it
take
the
long
time
perhaps
to
mend
the
little
pain
in
the
bone
i
certainly
hope
so
laughed
the
young
doctor
and
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
heard
it
there
was
no
irony
in
the
laugh
but
sheer
boyish
happiness
you
do
not
seem
quite
to
get
the
ideas
of
this
little
trip
that
i
should
make
she
reproached
him
briskly
it
is
not
just
that
i
go
but
that
i
stay
it
is
not
just
for
the
once
it
would
seem
but
for
the
all
time
that
this
lady
so
desires
me
the
ticket
that
she
so
kindly
sends
is
but
it
does
not
return
ticket
exclaimed
the
young
doctor
why
this
is
preposterous
you
do
really
mean
it
surely
there
nothing
that
can
make
you
go
you
know
so
said
solvei
did
i
not
make
the
dare
to
her
should
i
not
pay
is
it
not
then
as
you
say
i
have
drawn
the
fire
across
the
astonishing
gravity
of
her
tone
a
most
joyous
laugh
broke
suddenly
your
words
are
of
such
a
mixedness
she
laughed
drawn
drawn
is
it
not
rather
as
the
strong
banks
would
say
miss
solvei
kjelland
by
one
lady
from
the
south
has
been
withdrawn
from
the
circulations
but
i
adore
this
america
she
confided
blithely
always
around
every
corner
there
is
something
that
you
did
not
first
expect
when
you
curled
that
corner
yes
i
know
admitted
the
young
doctor
but
what
about
all
this
montessori
study
and
everything
are
you
going
to
chuck
it
and
the
little
brother
the
little
lad
who
is
he
asked
with
real
regret
it
will
all
keep
said
solvei
it
is
only
what
is
it
would
seem
that
should
pass
oh
but
miss
kjelland
insisted
the
young
doctor
this
whole
thing
is
absurd
i
i
believe
you
making
it
all
up
just
for
a
joke
if
you
going
to
be
home
next
sunday
afternoon
i
come
around
and
and
laugh
the
thing
out
with
you
next
sunday
afternoon
mused
solvei
with
the
manner
of
one
who
pauses
for
an
instant
to
count
the
days
on
the
fingers
and
this
now
this
minute
is
a
tuesday
she
questioned
still
speculatively
yes
agreed
the
young
doctor
no
it
will
not
be
possible
said
solvei
i
leave
yes
but
when
asked
the
young
doctor
now
said
solvei
already
it
is
that
i
can
hear
the
taxicab
adding
at
the
door
what
cried
the
young
doctor
under
the
river
waved
solvei
clear
young
voice
under
the
river
sam
kendrue
like
a
gigantic
wonder
bulb
the
northern
winter
is
dumped
down
thus
at
will
into
the
sunny
plushy
forcing
frame
of
a
new
york
pullman
to
bloom
in
perfect
scent
and
glory
only
one
day
two
days
three
days
later
in
some
welcoming
southland
if
solvei
kjelland
was
astonished
however
at
the
first
bland
sights
that
met
her
eyes
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
tome
gallien
in
all
her
years
of
experience
in
every
kind
of
a
southland
had
never
seen
any
thing
that
astonished
her
as
much
as
the
sight
of
solvei
kjelland
fuming
helplessly
in
her
great
mahogany
bed
with
its
of
pirate
and
sailor
and
siren
the
sick
woman
lay
staring
blankly
from
the
ceiling
to
the
piazza
railing
and
from
the
piazza
railing
to
the
dull
gray
sea
when
the
vision
first
burst
upon
her
why
why
martha
she
screamed
to
her
deaf
woman
there
is
a
bright
blue
girl
in
the
wrangle
boat
and
nobody
is
wrangling
they
are
coming
right
along
i
mean
scudding
and
the
girl
is
running
the
engine
from
her
own
quick
glance
at
the
scene
the
deaf
woman
answering
voice
came
back
as
calm
as
remote
as
as
the
voice
of
an
old
letter
you
sent
for
a
girl
to
come
i
believe
said
the
deaf
woman
yes
i
know
fumed
tome
gallien
but
i
hardly
dreamed
for
a
moment
that
she
really
would
what
said
the
deaf
woman
never
dreamed
that
she
would
repeated
tome
gallien
as
economically
as
she
could
most
things
that
you
send
for
seem
to
come
monotoned
the
deaf
woman
by
no
means
unamiably
there
no
room
left
in
the
storeroom
now
for
the
last
box
of
japanese
or
the
french
wedding
gown
or
the
fireless
cooker
where
shall
we
put
the
girl
in
the
fireless
cooker
snapped
tome
gallien
from
the
vague
acquiescent
smile
on
martha
face
it
was
evident
that
she
sensed
the
spirit
if
not
the
words
of
the
suggestion
the
next
direction
however
was
startlingly
clear
with
a
quite
unmistakable
gesture
tome
gallien
pointed
toward
the
stairs
martha
go
to
it
she
screamed
to
a
person
lying
in
bed
voices
travel
so
much
quicker
than
do
the
owners
of
the
voices
through
what
seemed
an
eternity
then
of
time
and
noise
grounding
men
grumbling
boys
shouting
women
chattering
the
sick
woman
waited
in
the
lonely
hush
of
her
immediate
surroundings
with
a
very
perceptible
shiver
of
nervousness
flashing
from
moment
to
moment
across
her
spine
illustration
as
coolly
as
if
she
had
been
appraising
a
new
dog
or
pussy
tome
gallien
narrowed
her
eyes
to
both
the
vision
and
the
announcement
then
all
and
and
theatrically
incongruous
like
some
splendid
young
viking
of
old
rigged
out
in
a
girl
blue
and
ultramodern
the
stranger
loomed
up
suddenly
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
with
martha
portly
white
figure
backgrounding
every
radiant
flutter
and
line
of
the
blue
and
gold
silhouette
i
am
come
said
solvei
kjelland
as
coolly
as
if
she
had
been
appraising
a
new
dog
or
pussy
tome
gallien
narrowed
her
eyes
to
both
the
vision
and
the
announcement
certainly
you
are
a
very
young
person
she
conceded
at
last
but
of
such
an
ungodly
name
is
there
no
way
to
overcome
it
over
come
it
puzzled
solvei
for
a
single
shadowed
instant
oh
that
is
most
easy
she
brightened
almost
at
once
solway
it
is
as
though
it
was
and
you
may
call
me
said
tome
gallien
without
the
flicker
of
an
eyelash
repeated
the
girl
painstakingly
oh
i
suppose
that
will
do
sighed
tome
gallien
struggling
up
a
little
bit
higher
on
her
pillows
but
whatever
in
the
world
made
you
come
she
demanded
tartly
but
if
the
question
was
like
a
dash
of
cold
water
solvei
reaction
to
it
was
at
least
the
reaction
of
a
duck
back
you
mean
you
did
not
really
want
me
she
preened
and
fluttered
her
voice
was
ecstasy
her
eyes
like
stars
i
certainly
did
not
sliced
tome
gallien
clear
incisive
voice
oh
of
what
a
joyousness
and
retribution
beamed
solvei
of
what
a
gloriosity
as
the
shooting
camping
is
to
the
sad
little
lady
and
the
piano
to
the
young
doctor
so
thus
am
i
to
you
what
then
shall
happen
to
everyone
of
us
is
yet
on
the
lap
of
the
gods
let
us
kiss
she
suggested
as
one
prize
fighter
might
proffer
his
hand
to
another
i
am
not
a
kisser
thank
you
said
tome
gallien
with
some
coldness
acquiesced
the
girl
softly
if
her
spirit
faltered
for
an
instant
her
blue
eyes
fortunately
faltered
no
lower
than
the
great
clutter
of
boxes
that
flanked
gallien
bed
in
every
direction
for
why
are
there
so
many
boxes
she
looked
up
suddenly
to
ask
with
a
smile
that
would
have
disarmed
a
tartar
why
why
those
are
just
some
things
i
been
buying
lately
relaxed
tome
gallien
ever
so
slightly
there
is
so
very
much
to
do
here
some
days
except
just
to
read
the
advertisements
in
the
back
of
the
magazines
and
send
for
things
martha
hates
it
she
added
with
a
sudden
wry
glance
at
martha
impassive
face
said
solvei
and
the
word
was
divided
absolutely
evenly
between
praise
of
the
boxes
and
disparagement
of
martha
the
boxes
seemed
to
have
heard
their
part
of
it
anyway
the
string
on
a
huge
brown
paper
package
burst
suddenly
as
though
for
sheer
excitement
martha
will
show
you
to
your
room
said
tome
gallien
quite
imperviously
and
whatever
else
you
try
to
jar
pray
do
waste
your
energies
trying
to
jar
martha
by
a
most
merciful
dispensation
of
providence
her
sensibilities
have
been
wrapped
in
a
cotton
batting
silence
for
the
past
twenty
years
you
may
in
time
learn
to
understand
me
she
smiled
faintly
with
her
first
kindness
but
you
will
never
understand
martha
come
back
to
me
after
supper
if
you
wish
and
wear
something
blue
if
you
have
it
i
like
you
in
blue
it
was
long
after
supper
when
solvei
returned
but
at
least
she
was
in
blue
and
a
very
neat
and
trim
blue
it
was
and
essentially
boyish
with
its
soft
collar
rolling
back
from
her
slender
throat
like
one
fairly
consumed
with
the
winter
novelty
of
boats
and
beaches
too
full
of
a
hundred
new
excitements
to
speak
she
dropped
down
on
the
low
footstool
by
tome
pungent
smoky
lightwood
fire
and
with
her
blue
elbows
on
her
blue
knees
and
her
white
chin
cupped
in
her
white
hands
sat
staring
at
her
hostess
the
whole
breathless
significance
of
youth
was
in
her
face
youth
struggled
eternally
for
its
own
best
but
when
she
spoke
a
single
sentence
only
burst
from
her
lips
what
was
in
that
big
brown
that
should
burst
so
she
asked
with
a
sudden
elfish
impudence
but
instead
of
being
annoyed
by
the
question
tome
gallien
seemed
on
the
contrary
to
be
rather
amused
with
it
you
like
boxes
she
asked
with
a
faintly
quizzical
lift
of
her
eyebrows
boxes
flamed
solvei
it
is
like
the
new
day
when
the
string
breaks
it
is
the
dawn
should
there
then
be
in
it
jumps
the
heart
what
is
there
yet
that
will
come
oh
dear
me
smiled
tome
gallien
if
you
feel
like
that
about
it
by
all
means
come
and
open
it
i
forget
myself
what
is
in
it
there
are
so
many
nuts
maybe
she
laughed
or
a
new
carpet
sweeper
or
a
sable
muff
even
with
all
the
frank
eagerness
of
a
child
solvei
kjelland
jumped
up
to
investigate
the
mystery
and
like
a
kitten
snarling
itself
into
worsteds
disappeared
for
the
moment
into
interminable
tissue
papers
only
to
emerge
at
last
brandishing
on
high
the
plumpest
gaudiest
altogether
most
hideous
sofa
pillow
that
human
eyes
were
ever
forced
to
contemplate
it
is
not
nuts
said
solvei
kjelland
in
another
moment
she
had
clasped
the
pillow
to
her
breast
oh
of
what
a
horror
she
laughed
and
how
beloved
is
it
the
work
then
she
demanded
of
a
blind
one
or
of
one
crazy
or
of
one
both
blind
and
crazy
back
of
the
laughter
and
the
question
was
a
sincere
and
unmistakable
concern
a
clergyman
widow
makes
them
confided
tome
gallien
somebody
over
in
alabama
i
saw
the
advertisement
in
a
country
newspaper
i
take
a
whole
lot
of
country
newspapers
for
just
that
sort
of
amusement
she
added
a
bit
drily
there
seems
to
be
such
an
everlasting
number
of
bunglers
in
the
world
who
are
trying
so
desperately
hard
to
make
a
little
money
this
woman
i
believe
is
trying
to
send
her
boy
to
college
with
the
pillow
extended
precipitously
to
full
arm
length
solvei
sat
for
a
moment
staring
from
the
chaotic
embroidery
to
tome
gallien
perfectly
composed
face
could
a
boy
come
to
any
of
the
good
that
should
go
to
college
on
a
pillow
like
that
she
demanded
uproariously
while
all
the
laughing
curves
of
her
mouth
seemed
reaching
suddenly
up
to
fend
off
the
threat
of
tears
in
her
eyes
once
again
she
clasped
the
pillow
to
her
breast
oh
the
bridge
that
it
does
make
into
the
other
life
she
cried
can
you
not
see
all
at
once
the
house
the
desolation
the
no
store
anywhere
with
fine
goods
to
compare
with
the
boy
so
thin
so
white
so
eager
perhaps
so
watching
of
every
stitch
that
most
dreadful
magenta
will
there
be
by
the
grace
of
the
good
god
a
chance
perhaps
for
the
latin
that
screaming
oranges
should
it
be
humanly
possible
that
so
much
joys
as
histories
and
boots
might
yet
be
in
the
same
world
with
the
latin
and
the
mother
so
pricked
with
needles
so
consumed
with
hopings
you
you
see
it
do
you
drawled
tome
gallien
see
it
flamed
solvei
i
it
with
the
gesture
of
one
who
sought
suddenly
to
hide
her
emotion
she
swung
around
abruptly
toward
the
other
side
of
the
room
what
else
is
there
then
she
asked
all
laughter
and
mischief
again
that
box
so
wooden
so
busted
at
the
top
is
that
also
a
bridge
to
some
other
livings
if
you
choose
to
call
it
so
nodded
tome
gallien
a
frankly
quizzical
invitation
to
explore
was
in
the
nod
solvei
certainly
needed
no
urging
in
another
instant
down
on
her
knees
before
the
great
wooden
box
she
was
slowly
extracting
from
wads
of
excelsior
piece
after
piece
of
the
most
exquisitely
delicate
and
transparent
turquoise
blue
china
beaded
in
gold
and
airily
overwrought
with
soaring
sea
gulls
there
was
a
big
breakfast
cup
and
a
breakfast
cup
and
a
big
plate
and
a
plate
and
a
cereal
saucer
and
another
cereal
saucer
and
a
most
stately
little
coffee
pot
and
all
the
other
attendants
and
attendants
to
attendants
which
fashion
assigns
to
just
that
sort
of
a
service
oh
it
is
for
the
fairies
then
gasped
solvei
or
a
princess
deftly
as
she
spoke
she
pulled
a
great
white
sheet
of
paper
to
her
and
spread
it
on
the
floor
as
a
cloth
no
she
quickened
it
is
for
lovers
see
the
first
breakfast
of
the
new
home
as
cautiously
as
though
she
had
been
handling
butterfly
wings
she
began
to
dramatize
the
scene
the
big
plate
there
the
plate
here
a
thus
a
woman
daintiness
so
in
the
ingenuousness
of
her
own
visualization
she
lifted
the
bride
cup
to
her
lips
and
sipped
an
ecstatic
draught
from
it
mocha
or
java
mocked
tome
gallien
joy
said
solvei
kjelland
in
a
sudden
fit
of
abstraction
then
the
girl
struggled
slowly
to
her
knees
and
knelt
thus
staring
very
thoughtfully
all
around
her
so
is
it
then
with
all
these
boxes
she
asked
that
from
this
desert
island
lying
so
you
would
make
constantly
such
little
bridges
across
to
other
people
livings
in
time
it
is
i
mean
as
soon
as
you
should
bear
to
part
with
them
you
would
build
even
these
most
heavenish
dishes
across
to
some
young
happiness
but
will
such
a
young
happiness
ever
take
the
troubles
to
cross
back
to
you
she
demanded
with
sudden
fierceness
that
is
it
i
say
that
is
it
a
prattling
note
perhaps
a
for
being
so
rich
but
do
they
ever
yet
write
more
late
to
tell
that
the
gift
is
still
well
that
it
has
made
new
joy
that
very
morning
perhaps
that
even
yet
after
one
month
six
months
twenty
it
is
still
so
dear
they
never
have
admitted
tome
gallien
in
utter
irrelevance
the
girl
sank
back
on
her
heels
and
crossing
her
arms
on
her
breast
began
to
rock
herself
joyously
to
and
fro
oh
i
do
love
this
place
so
she
confided
i
do
love
it
so
and
if
you
should
then
keep
me
she
beamed
and
i
should
be
quite
pleasant
there
is
a
lawn
mower
i
read
in
yesterday
paper
most
wonderful
it
is
and
runs
by
the
gasolene
so
that
all
one
needs
to
do
is
to
follow
singing
gaily
could
you
send
for
such
a
lawn
mower
sniffed
tome
gallien
you
noticed
i
trust
that
there
was
no
nice
grass
whatsoever
on
this
island
yes
that
is
most
so
admitted
solvei
neither
equally
is
there
any
young
happinesses
or
boys
making
for
latin
but
if
we
were
possessed
of
such
a
lawn
mower
and
its
wonderfulness
we
could
at
least
make
the
fine
green
lawns
in
the
mind
solvei
snapped
tome
gallien
i
am
dreadfully
afraid
that
i
am
going
to
like
you
but
before
i
actually
commit
myself
she
frowned
i
want
to
ask
you
one
question
are
you
in
the
habit
of
letting
strange
young
men
kiss
you
what
jumped
solvei
very
significantly
tome
gallien
repeated
the
question
strange
young
men
she
revised
it
are
you
in
the
habit
of
letting
strange
young
men
kiss
you
oh
flushed
solvei
it
is
then
the
young
doctor
that
you
mean
was
it
so
that
he
thus
confessed
it
to
you
she
questioned
a
bit
bewilderedly
so
shamed
he
was
so
worried
i
had
not
just
thought
that
he
should
tell
yes
it
is
as
you
say
he
is
one
most
strange
young
man
yes
but
you
persisted
tome
gallien
how
did
you
feel
about
it
that
what
i
want
to
know
how
should
i
feel
laughed
solvei
why
it
was
so
mad
i
was
so
strong
i
could
have
crushed
him
on
the
steps
and
then
suddenly
i
see
his
face
bah
shrugged
solvei
i
have
one
father
and
nine
brothers
and
all
the
world
is
most
full
of
men
it
is
not
from
such
a
face
as
the
young
doctor
that
any
evil
should
come
it
is
just
as
i
have
said
one
very
sad
accident
it
does
not
seem
to
be
just
the
sadness
of
the
accident
that
lingers
longest
in
your
mind
drawled
tome
gallien
with
her
chin
and
her
eyes
like
stars
the
girl
met
the
sarcasm
without
a
flicker
of
resentment
no
she
laughed
it
is
not
the
sadness
of
the
accident
that
remains
longest
in
the
mind
mused
tome
gallien
all
the
same
she
resumed
with
sharpness
i
certainly
think
it
was
most
cruel
most
brutal
of
him
not
to
make
the
trip
down
here
with
me
it
would
have
done
him
good
she
insisted
just
the
mere
balmy
change
of
it
he
is
so
grim
oh
but
he
can
not
help
the
being
grim
flared
solvei
he
is
so
poor
and
so
wanting
things
how
should
he
yet
achieve
them
except
by
sticking
close
to
that
most
saddest
of
all
truths
that
the
only
ways
to
get
ahead
is
to
stay
behind
and
attend
to
one
business
solvei
asked
tome
gallien
quite
abruptly
have
you
gotten
the
impression
in
any
way
that
the
young
doctor
was
was
attracted
at
all
to
my
little
widow
friend
oh
of
a
surety
attested
solvei
he
is
i
think
what
one
would
say
of
her
oh
i
hardly
dare
to
hope
that
mused
tome
gallien
but
of
course
in
some
speculation
the
sentence
faded
suddenly
off
into
silence
she
will
of
course
be
very
rich
some
day
i
suppose
she
resumed
a
bit
haughtily
i
shall
i

make
her
my
heir

with
another
spurt
of
abruptness
speaking
of
to
one
business
if
should
decide
to
stay
here
and
make
your
business
what
do
you
think
you
could
do
for
me
oh
i
could
do
the
reading
aloud
brightened
solvei
instantly
and
i
could
thus
open
the
boxes
and
i
could
run
the
wrangle
boat
she
quickened
and
glowed
and
also
if
it
should
so
seem
best
i
could
scrub
the
blue
flannel
crockings
from
the

so
dramatic

picked
up
the

it
happened
to
be
the
golden
treasury
and
just
out
of
sheer
temperamental
eagerness
selected

confided

it

passed
the

wordsworth
you

on
intimations
of
immortality
from
recollections
of
early
childhood

solvei
all

it
is
not
certainly
of
a
poetry
sound
but
more
later
perhaps
it
will
tell
all
the
rest
is
most
easy
looking
there
was
some
time
she
began
when
when
meadows

also
streams

all
things
perfectly

for
the
first
time
the
actual
glinting
mockery
in
the
older

eyes
what

she
stammered
what
still
like
some

more
bewildered
than

she
struggled
to
her
feet
even
as
from
the

questioned

hard
to

you
are
angry
and
leave

shall
be
left
all
alone
again
with
just
the

even
just

implored

my

i

poor
little
blonde

asserted
solvei
with
some
spirit
i
am
indeed
as
i
said
very
young
very
strong
and
very
laughing
she
insisted
without
even
the
remotest
flicker
of
a
smile
are
you
young
enough
and
strong
enough
and
laughing
enough
to
come
over
here
and
sit
on
my
bed
rallied
tome
gallien
i
am
young
enough
and
strong
enough
and
laughing
enough
to
do
anything
said
solvei
kjelland
stiff
and
stern
as
a
ramrod
she
went
over
and
sat
on
the
side
of
the
sick
woman
bed
without
an
atom
of
or
embarrassment
both
women
began
all
over
again
to
study
each
other
faces
could
i
put
my
hand
on
your
yellow
hair
asked
gallien
at
last
quite
surprisingly
you
could
put
your
hand
on
my
yellow
hair
said
solvei
if
i
should
apologize
fairly
decently
for
existing
at
all
experimented
tome
gallien
a
little
further
would
you
be
willing
to
kiss
now
i
should
never
be
willing
sighed
solvei
to
kiss
any
lips
that
tasted
of
mockerings
what
would
you
be
willing
to
do
ventured
tome
gallien
what
would
you
want
me
to
do
relaxed
solvei
ever
so
slightly
through
tome
gallien
busy
brain
a
dozen
possible
answers
tested
themselves
one
against
the
other
well
would
you
be
willing
to
to
tell
me
a
little
story
she
chose
as
the
most
promising
one
tell
you
a
little
story
queried
solvei
once
again
her
whole
face
darkened
with
suspicion
yes
about
my
little
island
hurried
tome
gallien
it
was
dark
when
i
came
and
they
put
me
right
into
this
bed
i
do
not
leave
my
bed
you
know
what
quivered
solvei
this
most
beautiful
little
island
you
have
not
seen
it
since
you
came
in
the
very
tensity
of
the
question
all
the
blue
seemed
to
surge
back
suddenly
to
her
eyes
all
the
pink
to
her
cheeks
why
of
a
sureness
she
cried
will
i
tell
you
about
this
little
island
softly
then
for
a
moment
she
patted
her
skirts
and
recrossed
her
slippered
feet
and
fumbled
with
the
big
silk
tie
that
closed
her
collar
then
quite
geographically
she
began
her
narrative
first
of
all
she
explained
it
is
a
round
little
island
really
you
surprise
me
said
tome
gallien
purely
automatically
so
many
islands
are
square
and
there
are
fish
upon
it
glowed
the
narrator
oh
surely
not
upon
it
shivered
tome
gallien
and
there
are
seven
monstrous
what
you
call
trees
dripping
with
gray
beards
it
is
most
terrible
gloated
the
narrator
and
in
one
tree
alone
have
i
seen
with
my
own
eyes
seven
most
scarlet
birds
and
two
blue
birds
and
in
yet
another
tree
there
is
a
fine
and
all
along
by
what
you
should
call
the
edge
of
the
porch
blue
violets
are
coming
and
on
the
roof
where
the
wrangle
boat
sleeps
there
is
an
green
vine
that
shall
yet
be
yellow
and
sweet
martha
tells
and
and
around
the
corners
of
the
girl
red
lips
a
faint
little
smile
showed
suddenly
and
there
is
one
little
black
pig
so
grunting
she
announced
with
rapture
and
and
so
the
sweet
eager
revitalizing
young
voice
ran
on
till
martha
herself
appeared
to
announce
sleeping
time
and
tome
gallien
whose
sleeping
time
for
years
had
been
a
farce
of
ghost
and
specter
dozed
off
before
she
was
even
half
undressed
to
dream
like
a
child
of
budding
violets
and
flitting
birds
and
a
glow
that
should
be
of
jessamine
instead
of
gold
hours
fall
so
easily
out
of
a
day
days
out
of
a
week
weeks
out
of
a
month
the
jessamine
glow
did
come
in
its
own
good
time
as
did
also
various
other
things
which
nature
had
ordained
march
winds
march
rains
march
tides
march
sunshine
other
wonders
came
too
that
were
of
course
tome
ordaining
rather
than
nature
fabulous
shoppings
from
all
the
big
marts
of
the
world
and
little
pitiful
home
made
products
from
backwoods
settlement
or
lonely
prairie
once
and
for
all
time
relieved
of
the
hazardous
task
of
reading
aloud
to
a
capricious
invalid
solvei
came
and
went
like
a
young
sea
breeze
whistling
through
the
halls
singing
through
the
rooms
sweeping
across
the
island
frolicking
on
the
water
if
it
was
fair
to
rate
her
as
a
rather
exceptionally
clever
and
daring
young
navigator
on
the
sea
of
fact
it
was
only
fair
to
acknowledge
her
equally
clever
equally
daring
in
the
realms
of
fancy
smiling
knowingly
into
martha
silences
laughing
at
the
wrangle
boat
man
or
boy
waving
a
slim
hand
in
and
out
of
tome
gallien
narrow
vista
scudding
to
and
from
the
mainland
on
interminable
errands
or
curled
up
for
long
cozy
evenings
on
the
foot
of
tome
gallien
bed
to
visualize
their
mutual
magic
path
across
one
new
box
or
another
into
other
people
livings
solvei
kjelland
as
a
companion
was
frankly
a
success
then
one
day
very
late
in
march
or
even
the
first
of
april
something
came
which
was
partly
of
nature
ordaining
and
partly
of
tome
gallien
though
most
thoroughly
a
surprise
to
the
latter
one
concerned
it
was
a
letter
from
sam
kendrue
and
very
northern
whatever
the
new
york
winter
had
been
it
was
plainly
evident
that
the
new
york
spring
was
still
exceedingly
cold
tome
gallien
dear
madam
said
the
letter
as
it
seems
best
to
me
at
just
this
time
that
kendrue
should
supplement
her
treatment
with
a
trip
south
it
is
my
intention
to
accompany
her
in
view
of
this
fact
i
will
take
the
liberty
of
calling
upon
you
on
tuesday
next
trusting
that
your
island
experience
has
proved
beneficial
to
your
health
i
am
yours
truly
etc
smiled
tome
gallien
but
before
the
dull
fretted
bewilderment
in
solvei
kjelland
face
her
smile
sharpened
suddenly
into
impatience
why
surely
solvei
she
scolded
with
all
your
english
you
might
at
least
understand
that
shifted
solvei
from
one
slim
ankle
to
the
other
it
does
not
seem
to
me
of
any
understanding
whatever
whether
it
should
be
sam
kendrue
kendrue
who
comes
or
just
mrs
kendrue
of
course
rallied
tome
gallien
good
nature
one
could
hardly
expect
them
to
be
married
by
now
or
even
engaged
perhaps
but
at
least
they
must
be
awfully
interested
how
about
your
poor
hardworking
young
doctor
she
gloated
take
the
tiniest
holiday
for
a
poor
old
crippled
creature
like
me
but
has
got
time
to
burn
when
it
comes
to
some
little
soft
thing
with
a
creak
in
her
love
is
sure
some
pranks
admitted
solvei
prank
corrected
tome
gallien
a
prank
repeated
solvei
with
perfect
docility
from
the
increasing
sweetness
of
her
day
dreams
tome
gallien
turned
idly
to
the
calendar
on
the
table
by
her
bedside
the
week
page
had
not
been
torn
off
nor
the
week
before
that
if
the
whole
truth
must
be
known
why
good
lack
she
jerked
suddenly
is
tuesday
so
jumped
solvei
both
women
turned
simultaneously
toward
the
clock
it
will
take
you
half
an
hour
to
make
the
mainland
and
that
train
cried
tome
gallien
and
for
goodness
sake
brush
your
hair
and
change
those
old
clothes
i
will
not
brush
the
hair
tossed
solvei
bright
head
always
it
is
my
preference
to
wear
it
thus
nor
will
i
part
ever
from
my
friend
this
old
blue
jersey
and
even
so
if
the
sun
does
not
fade
between
the
here
and
the
mainland
i
may
yet
achieve
three
new
freckles
on
my
nose
do
argue
fumed
tome
gallien
just
hurry
it
is
only
when
one
hurries
that
one
has
time
to
argue
persisted
the
girl
oh
stop
your
nonsense
ordered
tome
gallien
whose
nonsense
will
then
be
left
to
us
flared
solvei
but
do
not
thus
make
all
this
extra
worrisome
she
admonished
with
sudden
gentleness
time
is
always
more
fat
than
you
think
but
for
two
such
fancy
fine
packages
as
i
go
now
to
fetch
she
flared
again
ever
so
slightly
there
will
not
be
room
also
in
the
boat
for
the
face
of
the
wrangle
boat
man
nor
yet
for
the
legs
of
the
boy
it
is
alone
i
insist
that
i
should
go
for
mercy
sake
fretted
tome
gallien
i
do
care
how
you
go
if
you
only
go
without
further
parleying
solvei
started
for
the
stairs
in
another
minute
with
a
few
jumps
and
slides
she
had
reached
the
front
door
once
outside
it
took
but
a
fraction
more
of
time
to
settle
the
wrangle
boat
man
and
boy
sitting
here
in
perfect
peace
on
the
shore
she
admonished
them
watch
thus
how
one
isolated
person
with
no
words
but
oil
can
make
a
boat
prance
on
the
waves
all
aboard
she
called
back
exultantly
to
them
with
a
chug
like
a
great
pounding
heartthrob
the
wrangle
boat
sprang
for
the
sea
just
for
a
moment
then
at
the
last
signaling
point
solvei
lifted
her
hand
in
unfailing
cheeriness
to
the
sick
woman
and
the
deaf
woman
left
behind
and
turned
her
own
inordinately
sharpened
young
senses
toward
the
mainland
but
when
the
ructious
little
wrangle
boat
drew
up
a
half
hour
later
alongside
the
dilapidated
mainland
wharf
before
an
admiring
audience
of
jet
black
pickaninnies
and
mangy
hounds
there
was
only
one
passenger
waiting
impatiently
there
and
that
passenger
was
sam
kendrue
how
do
you
do
sam
kendrue
said
solvei
how
do
do
miss
solvei
kjelland
grinned
doctor
kendrue
with
more
agility
than
one
might
have
dared
to
hope
for
from
one
who
boasted
so
much
winter
in
his
blood
the
young
doctor
snatched
up
his
valise
jumped
down
into
the
wrangle
boat
and
pushed
off
to
avoid
running
into
a
sunken
rowboat
and
a
floating
snag
solvei
was
compelled
to
start
her
engine
and
turn
sharply
out
to
sea
where
then
is
your
mrs
kendrue
she
called
a
bit
breathlessly
above
the
lap
of
wind
and
water
it
is
my
kendrue
that
i
have
come
to
get
said
the
young
doctor
with
a
little
oil
can
poised
abruptly
in
midair
solvei
opened
the
same
old
bewildered
blue
eyes
at
him
oh
no
she
hastened
to
disillusion
him
your
kendrue
is
not
yet
on
our
island
no
of
course
she
is
laughed
the
young
doctor
and
a
jolly
good
reason
why
and
the
reason
is
because
she
right
here
in
the
boat
what
stammered
solvei
with
frenzied
haste
she
began
very
suddenly
to
oil
everything
in
reach
what
she
repeated
vaguely
i
mean
just
what
i
say
said
the
young
doctor
and
made
a
slight
move
as
of
one
who
would
cross
one
cramped
knee
over
the
other
with
all
the
joy
of
a
foreigner
easing
his
dictional
panic
with
an
idiom
solvei
snatched
out
at
the
first
phrase
she
could
think
of
that
had
a
familiar
word
in
it
sit
down
you
rocking
the
boat
she
screamed
silly
said
the
young
doctor
i
was
once
in
a
boat
before
quite
wretchedly
he
began
then
and
there
to
try
and
recover
his
old
manner
the
irony
the
mocking
really
miss
kjelland
he
ducked
as
a
great
cloud
of
spray
went
by
him
really
miss
kjelland
you
awfully
rough
with
boats
oh
but
solvei
he
broke
through
again
in
spite
of
himself
you
understand
what
trying
to
say
now
do
you
no
i
do
said
solvei
kjelland
with
her
great
blue
eyes
staring
straight
ahead
through
the
veil
of
her
windblown
hair
at
some
far
focal
point
just
over
the
wrangle
boat
prancing
bow
once
again
a
great
cloud
of
spray
missed
the
young
doctor
by
the
width
only
of
his
dodge
and
how
is
it
then
about
kendrue
mrs
kendrue
asked
solvei
quite
suddenly
out
of
the
gusty
sky
oh
said
the
young
doctor
with
the
most
surprising
revival
of
cheerfulness
why
why
she
gone
on
down
to
investigate
her
new
duck
blind
with
the
rest
of
her
party
there
a
tenor
it
seems
who
is
rather
well
contenting
you
could
hardly
use
any
other
word
with
her
she
so
awfully
inexpressive
anyway
it
a
diverting
friendship
for
her
though
whether
the
tenor
can
hit
a
high
duck
as
niftily
as
he
can
hit
a
high
note
remains
of
course
to
be
seen
said
solvei
with
indifferent
interest
and
is
the
piano
well
oh
fairly
well
conceded
the
young
doctor
but
if
ever
i
saw
a
piano
that
needed
a
mother
care
i
had
to
board
it
out
you
know
crooned
solvei
sweet
low
voice
it
was
astonishing
though
how
soon
the
sea
calmed
down
after
that
at
least
there
was
no
more
spray
skirting
round
at
last
along
the
sunny
sheltered
side
of
the
little
island
instead
of
splashing
boldly
up
to
the
regular
landing
as
was
her
usual
custom
it
seemed
indeed
as
though
solvei
was
suddenly
trying
to
feed
out
serenity
to
the
man
before
her
the
floating
gray
moss
of
the
trees
was
certainly
serene
the
twitter
of
birds
the
soft
warm
drone
of
insect
without
an
interrupting
word
she
drove
the
nose
into
a
roughly
improvised
harbor
of
floating
logs
and
a
raft
jumped
out
upon
the
raft
and
beckoned
the
young
doctor
to
follow
her
but
at
the
first
thud
of
his
foot
on
the
turf
it
was
the
young
doctor
himself
who
broke
the
vocal
silence
oh
but
solvei
he
protested
you
got
to
know
that
you
are
the
only
kendrue
that
i
want
queried
solvei
glancing
back
with
a
vaguely
skeptical
smile
across
her
blue
jersey
shoulder
oh
of
course
admitted
the
young
doc
tor
just
right
away
at
the
very
first
i
did
know
it
perhaps
you
were
so
so
well
so
sort
of
unusual
he
flushed
and
so
awfully
independent
about
the
adventure
and
the
little
widow
and
everything
you
made
it
so
perfectly
plain
you
did
need
me
that
it
was
till
you
actually
gone
that
i
half
woke
up
to
the
fact
how
much
i
needed
you
why
solvei
after
you
ran
away
the
city
was
like
a
gray
fog
with
no
light
in
it
no
laughter
no
anything
the
days
were
a
week
long
the
nights
a
month
is
it
any
wonder
that
i
should
feel
as
though
i
loved
you
for
almost
ever
and
ever
why
if
it
had
been
for
my
work
and
the
knowledge
that
work
and
work
only
could
bring
me
to
you
oh
i
know
it
awfully
sudden
and
everything
he
persisted
desperately
but
why
people
prate
so
everlastingly
about
at
first
sight
and
never
make
any
talk
at
all
about
at
first
absence
solvei
you
simply
got
to
understand
he
cried
out
in
her
few
steps
lead
of
him
the
girl
stopped
suddenly
and
turned
around
but
of
what
good
is
it
that
i
should
understand
she
asked
with
a
little
appealing
gesture
of
her
hands
in
my
far
norway
is
it
not
that
i
have
still
the
cause
of
the
little
brother
and
here
she
puzzled
how
could
i
yet
leave
elizabeth
elizabeth
questioned
the
young
doctor
tome
gallien
explained
the
girl
elizabeth
repeated
the
young
doctor
with
increasing
astonishment
you
mean
you
are
such
friends
as
that
yes
nodded
the
girl
i
am
such
friends
as
that
across
the
lovely
earnestness
of
her
face
sun
and
shadow
flickered
intermittently
softly
her
blue
eyes
brooded
her
bright
gold
hair
was
like
a
flame
in
all
that
sunny
singing
island
there
was
no
radiance
like
her
unless
perhaps
it
was
the
blue
bird
who
flashed
through
the
gray
moss
just
beyond
her
i
can
not
leave
the
little
brother
she
said
nor
can
i
leave
the
elizabeth
as
though
kindled
by
the
spring
own
sweet
her
whole
musing
face
flamed
suddenly
with
joy
nor
i
am
so
greedy
she
cried
yet
can
i
leave
all
unbeknown
then
to
tome
gallien
or
even
to
martha
they
crept
up
the
stairs
at
last
to
tome
gallien
room
where
with
the
poor
young
doctor
relegated
ignominiously
behind
her
solvei
chose
for
her
own
whimsical
purposes
to
make
her
dramatic
entrance
good
afternoon
to
you
then
elizabeth
she
hailed
casually
to
the
impatient
sick
woman
on
the
bed
this
of
a
surety
is
time
when
meadows
groves
also
streams
to
me
did
seems
a
apparelled
in
celestial
lightings
what
gasped
tome
gallien
why
what
makes
your
cheeks
so
red
she
demanded
suddenly
i
got
kissed
again
said
solvei
what
snapped
tom
gallien
they
did
not
come
said
solvei
no
such
kendrues
combination
as
you
suggested
nothing
came
said
solvei
except
just
one
big
package
for
me
for
you
frowned
tome
gallien
for
me
shrugged
solvei
and
though
it
should
be
hard
yet
to
tell
just
what
livings
it
shall
lead
to
it
shall
at
least
lead
to
much
lovings
what
puzzled
tome
gallien
this
is
it
said
solvei
and
dragged
the
young
doctor
into
the
room
screamed
tome
gallien
it
is
for
you
understand
beamed
the
girl
in
the
convulsive
laughter
that
overtook
the
young
doctor
he
did
not
at
the
moment
notice
tome
gallien
face
but
there
was
no
laughter
of
any
kind
in
tome
gallien
face
only
shock
and
a
most
furious
rage
so
it
is
thus
you
have
been
deceiving
me
she
cried
out
to
solvei
all
this
time
that
you
knew
what
my
heart
was
fixed
on
my
hopes
my
everything
all
this
time
that
you
have
been
here
a
guest
in
my
house
and
quite
safe
i
supposed
from
any
such
oh
now
really
mrs
gallien
interposed
the
young
grimmest
sternest
voice
oh
of
what
a
nonsense
laughed
solvei
there
is
no
blames
anywhere
unless
it
should
be
to
this
montessori
theory
out
of
the
whole
wide
world
is
it
not
that
a
child
must
gravitate
to
his
own
wantings
it
can
not
be
chosen
for
him
then
with
all
the
young
laughter
gone
from
her
face
she
reached
out
her
slim
brown
hand
to
the
young
doctor
reassuring
clasp
and
led
him
to
the
bed
elizabeth
she
said
you
are
rich
and
you
are
sick
and
you
are
sometimes
very
cross
but
you
can
not
buy
the
loving
here
then
are
two
children
who
would
love
you
all
your
life
long
all
their
lives
long
if
you
thus
furiously
so
refuse
the
gift
who
then
is
the
stingy
receiver
what
stammered
tome
gallien
what
across
her
haggard
face
a
smile
of
incredulous
enlightenment
flickered
suddenly
what
she
surrendered
you
you
and
held
out
her
aching
arms
to
them
