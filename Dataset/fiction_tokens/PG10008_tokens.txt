and
you

a
schooner
comporting
herself
in
a
manner
uncommon
on
the
pacific
a
man
who
was
a
bit
of
a
mechanic
was
set
to
work
to
open
the
chest
slowly
the
man
defined
himself
as
a
shape
takes
form
in
a
fog
these
sheep
had
become
as
wild
as
deer
the
firing
now
became
miscellaneous
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
any
one
else
with
a
strangled
cry
the
sailor
cast
the
shirt
from
him
sorry
not
to
have
met
you
at
the
door
he
said
courteously
part
one
the
sea
riddle
i
desert
seas
the
late
afternoon
sky
flaunted
its
splendour
of
blue
and
gold
like
a
banner
over
the
pacific
across
whose
depths
the
trade
wind
droned
in
measured
cadence
on
the
ocean
wide
expanse
a
hulk
wallowed
sluggishly
the
forgotten
relict
of
a
once
brave
and
sightly
ship
possibly
the
sphinx
of
some
untold
ocean
tragedy
she
lay
black
and
forbidding
in
the
ordered
procession
of
waves
half
a
mile
to
the
east
of
the
derelict
hovered
a
ship
cutter
the
turn
of
her
crew
heads
speaking
expectancy
as
far
again
beyond
the
united
states
cruiser
outlined
her
severe
and
trim
silhouette
against
the
horizon
in
all
the
spread
of
wave
and
sky
no
other
thing
was
visible
for
this
was
one
of
the
desert
parts
of
the
pacific
three
hundred
miles
north
of
the
steamship
route
from
yokohama
to
honolulu
five
hundred
miles
from
the
nearest
land
gardner
island
and
more
than
seven
hundred
northwest
of
the
hawaiian
group
on
the
cruiser
the
officers
lined
the
starboard
rail
their
interest
was
focussed
on
the
derelict
looks
like
a
heavy
job
said
ives
one
of
the
junior
lieutenants
these
floaters
that
lie
with
deck
almost
awash
will
stand
more
hammering
than
a
mud
fort
wish
they
let
us
put
some
shells
into
her
said
billy
edwards
the
ensign
a
wistful
expression
on
his
big
round
cheerful
face
i
like
to
see
what
they
would
do
nothing
but
waste
a
few
hundred
dollars
of
your
uncle
sam
money
observed
carter
the
officer
of
the
deck
it
takes
placed
charges
inside
and
out
for
that
kind
of
work
barnett
the
man
for
her
then
said
ives
he
no
economist
when
it
comes
to
getting
results
there
she
goes
without
any
particular
haste
as
it
seemed
to
the
watchers
the
hulk
was
shouldered
out
of
the
water
as
by
some
hidden
leviathan
its
outlines
melted
into
a
black
outshowering
mist
and
from
that
mist
leaped
a
giant
up
up
he
towered
tossed
whirling
arms
a
hundred
feet
abranch
shivered
and
dissolved
into
a
widespread
cataract
the
water
below
was
lashed
into
fury
in
the
midst
of
which
a
mighty
death
agony
beat
back
the
troubled
waves
of
the
trade
wind
only
then
did
the
muffled
double
boom
of
the
explosion
reach
the
ears
of
the
spectators
presently
to
be
followed
by
a
whispering
wavelet
that
swept
irresistibly
across
the
bigger
surges
and
lapped
the
ship
side
as
for
a
message
that
the
work
was
done
here
and
there
in
the
sea
a
glint
of
silver
a
patch
of
purple
or
dull
red
or
a
glistening
apparition
of
black
showed
where
the
unintended
victims
of
the
explosion
the
fish
of
the
warm
waters
had
succumbed
to
the
force
of
the
shock
of
the
intended
victim
there
was
no
sign
save
a
few
fragments
of
wood
bobbing
in
a
swirl
of
water
when
barnett
the
ordnance
officer
in
charge
of
the
destruction
returned
to
the
ship
carter
complimented
him
good
clean
job
barnett
she
was
a
tough
customer
too
what
was
she
asked
ives
the
schooner
anyone
know
about
her
ives
turned
to
the
ship
surgeon
trendon
a
grizzled
and
veteran
who
had
at
his
finger
tips
all
the
lore
of
all
the
waters
under
the
reign
of
the
moon
what
does
the
information
bureau
of
the
seven
seas
know
about
it
lost
three
years
ago
spring
of
got
into
ice
field
off
the
tip
of
the
aleutians
some
of
the
crew
froze
others
got
ashore
part
of
survivors
accounted
for
others
not
say
they
turned
native
know
myself
the
aleutians
exclaimed
billy
edwards
great
cats
what
a
drift
how
many
thousand
miles
would
that
be
not
as
far
as
many
another
derelict
has
wandered
in
her
time
son
said
barnett
the
talk
washed
back
and
forth
across
the
hulks
of
classic
sea
mysteries
new
and
old
of
the
of
which
went
down
with
all
hands
leaving
for
record
only
a
melancholy
scrawl
on
a
bit
of
board
to
meet
the
wondering
eyes
of
a
fisherman
on
the
far
cornish
coast
of
the
which
set
out
with
five
hundred
and
souls
aboard
bound
by
a
route
unknown
to
a
tragic
end
of
the
with
her
silent
and
empty
lifeboats
alone
left
drifting
about
the
open
sea
to
hint
at
the
story
of
her
fate
of
the
which
ten
years
later
on
the
same
day
and
date
and
hailing
from
the
same
port
as
the
went
out
into
the
void
leaving
no
trace
of
newfoundland
captains
who
sailed
roaring
with
drink
under
the
arches
of
cathedral
bergs
only
to
be
prisoned
buried
and
embalmed
in
the
one
icy
embrace
of
craft
assailed
by
the
terrible
lightning
clouds
of
the
indian
ocean
found
days
after
stone
blind
with
their
crews
madly
hauling
at
useless
sheets
while
the
officers
clawed
the
compass
and
shrieked
of
burnings
and
piracies
of
pest
ships
and
slave
ships
and
ships
mad
for
want
of
water
of
whelming
earthquake
waves
and
mysterious
suctions
drawing
irresistibly
against
wind
and
steam
power
upon
unknown
currents
of
stout
hulks
deserted
in
panic
although
sound
and
seaworthy
and
of
others
so
swiftly
dragged
down
that
there
was
no
time
for
any
to
save
himself
and
of
a
hundred
other
strange
stirring
and
pitiful
ventures
such
as
make
up
the
inevitable
peril
and
incorrigible
romance
of
the
ocean
in
a
pause
billy
edwards
said
musingly
well
there
was
the
how
did
you
happen
to
hit
on
her
asked
barnett
quickly
why
not
sir
it
naturally
came
into
my
head
she
was
last
seen
somewhere
about
this
part
of
the
world
was
she
after
a
hesitation
he
added
from
something
i
heard
ashore
i
judge
we
a
commission
to
keep
a
watch
out
for
her
as
well
as
to
destroy
derelicts
what
about
the
asked
mcguire
the
paymaster
a
new
englander
who
had
been
in
the
service
but
a
short
time
good
lord
do
you
remember
the
mystery
and
the
disappearance
of
doctor
schermerhorn
karl
augustus
schermerhorn
the
man
whose
experiments
to
identify
telepathy
with
the
marconi
wireless
waves
made
such
a
furore
in
the
papers
oh
that
was
only
a
of
his
mind
he
was
an
original
investigator
in
every
line
of
physics
and
chemistry
besides
most
of
the
natural
sciences
said
barnett
the
government
is
particularly
interested
in
him
because
of
his
contributions
to
aërial
photography
and
he
was
lost
with
the
nobody
knows
said
edwards
he
left
san
francisco
two
years
ago
on
a
schooner
with
an
assistant
a
big
chest
and
a
ragamuffin
crew
a
newspaper
man
named
slade
who
dropped
out
of
the
world
about
the
same
time
is
supposed
to
have
gone
along
too
their
schooner
was
last
sighted
about
miles
northeast
of
oahu
in
good
shape
and
bound
westward
that
all
the
record
of
her
that
there
is
was
that
ralph
slade
asked
barnett
yes
he
was
a
writer
and
artist
i
knew
him
well
said
barnett
he
was
in
our
mess
in
the
philippine
campaign
on
the
war
correspondent
then
strange
that
i
never
identified
him
before
with
the
slade
of
the
what
was
the
object
of
the
voyage
asked
ives
they
were
supposed
to
be
after
buried
treasure
said
barnett
i
always
thought
it
more
likely
that
doctor
schermerhorn
was
on
a
scientific
expedition
said
edwards
i
knew
the
old
boy
and
he
the
sort
to
care
a
hoot
in
sheol
for
treasure
buried
or
unburied
every
time
a
ship
sets
out
from
san
francisco
without
publishing
to
all
the
world
just
what
her
business
is
all
the
world
thinks
it
one
of
those
hunts
observed
ives
yes
agreed
barnett
flora
and
fauna
of
some
unknown
island
would
be
much
more
in
the
schermerhorn
line
of
traffic
not
unlikely
that
some
of
the
festive
natives
collected
the
unfortunate
professor
various
theories
were
advanced
withdrawn
refuted
defended
and
the
discussion
carried
them
through
the
swift
twilight
into
the
darkness
which
had
been
hastened
by
a
canopy
of
abruptly
from
the
came
startling
news
for
those
desolate
seas
light
ho
two
points
on
the
port
bow
the
lookout
had
given
extra
voice
to
it
it
was
plainly
heard
throughout
the
ship
the
group
of
officers
stared
in
the
direction
indicated
but
could
see
nothing
presently
ives
and
edwards
who
were
the
made
out
a
faint
suffused
radiance
at
the
same
time
came
a
second
hail
from
the
on
deck
sir
hello
responded
carter
the
officer
of
the
deck
there
a
light
here
i
ca
make
anything
out
of
sir
what
it
like
sort
of
a
queer
general
glow
general
glow
indeed
muttered
forsythe
among
the
group
aft
that
fellow
got
an
imagination
ca
you
describe
it
better
than
that
called
carter
do
make
it
out
at
all
sir
any
regular
and
proper
light
looks
like
a
lamp
in
a
fog
among
themselves
the
officers
discussed
it
interestedly
as
it
grew
plainer
not
unlike
the
electric
glow
above
a
city
seen
from
a
distance
said
barnett
as
it
grew
plainer
yes
but
the
nearest
city
is
some
eight
hundred
miles
away
objected
ives
mirage
maybe
suggested
edwards
pretty
mirage
to
cover
that
distance
said
ives
though
i
seen
great
heavens
look
at
that
shouted
edwards
a
great
shaft
of
pale
brilliance
shot
up
toward
the
zenith
under
it
whirled
a
maelstrom
of
varied
radiance
pale
with
distance
but
marvellously
beautiful
forsythe
passed
them
with
a
troubled
face
on
his
way
below
to
report
as
his
relief
went
up
the
quartermaster
reports
the
compass
behaving
queerly
he
said
three
minutes
later
the
captain
was
on
the
bridge
the
great
ship
had
swung
and
they
were
speeding
direct
for
the
phenomenon
but
within
a
few
minutes
the
light
had
died
out
another
sea
mystery
to
add
to
our
list
said
billy
edwards
did
anyone
ever
see
a
show
like
that
before
what
do
you
think
doc
humph
grunted
the
veteran
new
to
me
volcanic
maybe
ii
the
the
falling
of
dusk
on
june
the
found
tired
eyes
aboard
the
every
officer
in
her
complement
had
kept
a
private
and
personal
lookout
all
day
for
some
explanation
of
the
previous
phenomenon
all
that
rewarded
them
were
a
sky
filmed
with
lofty
clouds
and
the
holiday
parade
of
the
epauletted
waves
nor
did
evening
bring
a
repetition
of
that
strange
glow
midnight
found
the
late
stayers
still
deep
in
the
discussion
one
thing
is
certain
said
ives
it
was
volcanic
why
so
asked
the
paymaster
because
volcanoes
are
mostly
stationary
and
we
headed
due
for
that
light
yes
but
did
we
keep
headed
said
barnett
who
was
navigating
officer
as
well
as
ordnance
officer
in
a
queer
voice
what
do
you
mean
sir
asked
edwards
eagerly
after
the
light
disappeared
the
compass
kept
on
varying
the
stars
were
hidden
there
is
no
telling
just
where
we
were
headed
for
some
time
then
we
might
be
fifty
miles
from
the
spot
we
aimed
at
hardly
that
said
the
navigator
we
could
guide
her
to
some
extent
by
the
direction
of
wind
and
waves
if
it
was
volcanic
we
ought
certainly
to
have
sighted
it
by
now
always
some
electricity
in
volcanic
eruptions
said
trendon
makes
compass
cut
didoes
seen
it
before
where
queried
carter
off
martinique
pelée
eruption
needle
chased
its
tail
like
a
kitten
are
there
many
volcanoes
hereabouts
somebody
asked
we
in
west
north
about
said
barnett
no
telling
whether
there
are
or
not
there
were
at
last
accounts
but
that
no
evidence
that
there
are
some
since
they
come
up
in
the
night
these
volcanic
islands
just
cast
an
eye
on
the
charts
said
billy
edwards
full
of
and
all
over
the
shop
every
one
of
volcanic
and
p
queried
the
paymaster
existence
doubtful
and
position
doubtful
explained
the
ensign
every
time
the
skipper
of
one
of
these
wandering
trade
ships
gets
a
speck
in
his
eye
he
reports
an
island
if
he
really
does
bump
into
a
rock
he
cuts
in
an
arithmetic
book
for
his
latitude
and
longitude
and
lets
it
go
at
that
that
how
the
chart
makers
make
a
living
getting
out
new
editions
every
few
months
but
it
a
fact
that
these
seas
are
constantly
changing
said
barnett
they
so
little
travelled
that
no
one
happens
to
be
around
to
see
an
island
born
i
do
suppose
there
a
part
on
the
earth
surface
more
liable
to
seismic
disturbances
than
this
region
seismic
cried
billy
edwards
i
should
say
it
was
seismic
why
when
a
native
of
one
of
these
island
groups
sets
his
heart
on
a
particular
loaf
of
bread
up
his
tree
he
does
bother
to
climb
after
it
just
waits
for
some
earthquake
to
happen
along
and
shake
it
down
to
him
good
boy
billy
said
trendon
approvingly
do
another
it
a
fact
said
the
ensign
heatedly
why
a
couple
of
years
back
there
was
a
trader
here
stocked
up
with
a
lot
of
in
bottles
thought
he
was
going
to
make
his
pile
because
there
been
a
colic
epidemic
in
the
islands
the
season
before
bottles
were
labelled
not
shake
that
settled
his
business
might
as
well
have
marked
frozen
in
this
part
of
the
world
fellow
went
broke
in
any
case
said
barnett
such
a
glow
as
that
we
sighted
last
night
i
never
seen
from
any
volcano
nor
i
said
trendon
do
prove
it
might
have
been
i
just
bet
the
best
dinner
in
san
francisco
that
it
is
said
edwards
you
on
said
carter
let
me
in
suggested
ives
and
i
take
one
of
it
said
mcguire
come
one
come
all
said
edwards
cheerily
i
live
high
on
the
collective
bad
judgment
of
this
outfit
is
likely
to
settle
it
anyhow
said
ives
i
move
we
turn
in
expectant
minds
do
not
lend
themselves
to
sound
slumber
all
night
the
officers
of
the
slept
on
the
verge
of
waking
but
it
was
not
until
dawn
that
the
cry
of
sent
them
all
hurrying
to
their
clothes
ordinarily
officers
of
the
navy
do
not
scuttle
on
deck
like
a
crowd
of
curious
schoolgirls
but
all
hands
had
been
keyed
to
a
high
pitch
over
the
elusive
light
and
the
bet
with
edwards
now
served
as
an
excuse
for
the
betrayal
of
unusual
eagerness
hence
the
was
soon
alive
with
men
who
were
wont
to
be
deep
in
dreams
at
that
hour
they
found
carter
whose
watch
on
deck
it
was
reprimanding
the
lookout
no
sir
the
man
was
insisting
she
did
show
no
light
sir
i
sighted
her
an
hour
ago
sir
if
she
had
we
shall
see
said
carter
grimly
who
your
relief
sennett
let
him
take
your
place
go
aloft
sennett
as
the
lookout
crestfallen
and
surly
went
below
barnett
said
in
subdued
tones
upon
my
word
i
should
be
surprised
if
the
man
were
right
certainly
there
something
queer
about
that
hooker
look
how
she
handles
herself
the
vessel
was
some
three
miles
to
windward
she
was
a
schooner
of
the
common
pacific
type
but
she
was
comporting
herself
in
a
manner
uncommon
on
the
pacific
or
any
other
ocean
even
as
barnett
spoke
she
heeled
well
over
and
came
rushing
up
into
the
wind
where
she
stood
with
all
sails
shaking
slowly
she
paid
off
again
bearing
away
from
them
now
she
gathered
full
headway
yet
edged
little
by
little
to
windward
again
mighty
queer
tactics
muttered
edwards
i
think
she
steering
herself
good
thing
she
carries
a
weather
helm
commented
ives
who
was
an
expert
on
sailing
rigs
most
of
that
type
do
otherwise
she
have
jibed
her
masts
out
running
loose
that
way
captain
parkinson
appeared
on
deck
and
turned
his
glasses
for
a
full
minute
on
the
strange
schooner
aloft
there
he
hailed
the
do
you
make
out
anyone
aboard
no
sir
came
the
answer
carter
have
the
chief
quartermaster
report
on
deck
with
the
signal
flags
yes
sir
are
we
going
to
run
up
to
her
asked
mcguire
turning
in
surprise
to
edwards
and
take
the
risk
of
getting
a
hole
punched
in
our
pretty
paint
with
her
running
amuck
that
way
not
much
up
came
the
signal
quartermaster
to
get
his
orders
and
there
ensued
a
conversation
in
the
pregnant
language
of
the
sea
what
ship
is
that
no
answer
are
you
in
trouble
asked
the
cruiser
and
waited
the
schooner
showed
a
bare
and
silent
heave
to
now
uncle
sam
was
giving
orders
but
the
other
paid
no
heed
we
make
that
a
little
more
emphatic
said
captain
parkinson
a
moment
later
there
was
the
sharp
crash
of
a
gun
and
a
shot
went
across
the
bows
of
the
sailing
vessel
hastened
by
a
flaw
of
wind
that
veered
from
the
normal
direction
of
the
breeze
the
stranger
made
sharply
to
windward
as
if
to
obey
ah
there
she
comes
ran
the
comment
along
the
cruiser
but
the
schooner
after
standing
for
a
moment
all
flapping
answered
another
flaw
and
went
wide
about
on
the
opposite
tack
derelict
remarked
captain
parkinson
she
seems
to
be
in
good
shape
too
dr
trendon
yes
sir
the
surgeon
went
to
the
captain
and
the
others
could
hear
his
deep
abrupt
utterance
in
reply
to
some
question
too
low
for
their
ears
might
be
sir
maybe
more
likely
smallpox
if
anything
of
that
kind
but
of
would
be
on
deck
whew
a
plague
ship
said
billy
edwards
just
my
luck
to
be
ordered
to
board
her
he
shivered
slightly
scared
billy
said
ives
edwards
had
a
record
for
daring
which
made
this
joke
obvious
enough
to
be
safe
i
would
want
to
have
my
peculiar
style
of
beauty
spoiled
by
smallpox
marks
said
the
ensign
with
a
smile
on
his
homely
winning
face
and
i
a
hunch
that
that
ship
is
not
a
lucky
find
for
this
ship
then
i
a
hunch
that
your
hunch
is
a
wrong
one
said
ives
how
long
would
you
guess
that
craft
to
be
illustration
a
schooner
comporting
herself
in
a
manner
uncommon
on
the
pacific
they
were
now
within
a
mile
of
the
schooner
edwards
scrutinised
her
calculatingly
eighty
to
ninety
feet
say
tons
and
she
a
schooner
is
she
continued
ives
insinuatingly
she
certainly
is
well
i
a
hunch
that
that
ship
is
a
lucky
find
for
any
ship
but
particularly
for
this
ship
great
caesar
cried
the
ensign
excitedly
do
you
think
a
buzz
of
electric
interest
went
around
the
group
every
glass
was
raised
every
eye
strained
toward
her
stern
to
read
the
name
as
she
veered
into
the
wind
again
about
she
came
a
sharp
sigh
of
excited
disappointment
exhaled
from
the
spectators
the
name
had
been
painted
out
no
go
breathed
edwards
but
i
bet
another
dinner
edwards
called
the
captain
you
will
take
the
second
cutter
board
that
schooner
and
make
a
full
investigation
yes
sir
take
your
time
do
come
alongside
until
she
is
in
the
wind
leave
enough
men
aboard
to
handle
her
yes
sir
the
cruiser
steamed
to
within
half
a
mile
of
the
aimless
traveller
and
the
small
boat
put
out
not
one
of
his
fellows
but
envied
the
young
ensign
as
he
left
the
ship
steered
by
timmins
a
veteran
mate
wise
in
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
sea
ways
they
saw
him
board
neatly
running
the
small
boat
under
the
schooner
counter
they
saw
the
foresheet
eased
off
and
the
ship
run
up
into
the
wind
then
the
foresail
dropped
and
the
wheel
lashed
so
that
she
would
stand
so
they
awaited
the
reappearance
of
edwards
and
the
mate
when
they
had
vanished
below
decks
and
with
an
intensity
of
eagerness
they
followed
the
return
of
the
small
boat
billy
edwards
face
as
he
came
on
deck
was
a
study
it
was
alight
with
excitement
yet
between
the
eyes
two
deep
wrinkles
of
puzzlement
quivered
such
a
face
the
mathematician
bends
above
his
paper
when
some
obstructive
factor
arises
between
him
and
his
solution
well
sir
there
was
a
hint
of
effort
at
restraint
in
the
voice
she
the
sir
everything
but
not
a
soul
aboard
come
below
edwards
said
the
captain
and
they
went
leaving
behind
them
a
boiling
cauldron
of
theory
and
conjecture
iii
the
death
ship
billy
edwards
came
on
deck
with
a
line
of
irritation
the
furrows
between
his
eyes
go
ahead
the
bade
him
seeing
him
aflush
with
information
the
captain
wo
believe
me
blurted
out
edwards
is
it
as
bad
as
that
asked
barnett
smiling
it
certainly
is
replied
the
younger
man
seriously
i
do
know
that
i
blame
him
i
hardly
believe
it
myself
if
i
had
oh
go
on
out
with
it
give
us
the
facts
never
mind
your
credibility
the
facts
are
that
there
lies
the
a
little
but
sound
as
a
dollar
and
not
a
living
being
aboard
of
her
her
boats
are
all
there
everything
in
good
condition
though
none
too
orderly
pitcher
half
full
of
fresh
water
in
the
rack
sails
all
ashes
of
the
galley
fire
still
warm
i
tell
you
gentlemen
that
ship
has
been
deserted
more
than
a
couple
of
days
at
the
outside
are
you
sure
all
the
boats
are
there
asked
ives
dory
dingy
and
two
surf
boats
is
that
enough
plenty
been
over
her
inside
and
out
no
sign
of
collision
no
leak
no
anything
except
that
the
starboard
side
is
blistered
a
bit
no
evidence
of
fire
anywhere
else
i
tell
you
said
billy
edwards
pathetically
it
given
me
a
headache
perhaps
it
one
of
those
cases
of
panic
that
forsythe
spoke
of
the
other
night
said
ives
the
crew
got
frightened
at
something
and
ran
away
with
the
devil
after
them
but
crews
do
just
step
out
and
run
around
the
corner
and
hide
when
they
scared
objected
barnett
that
true
too
assented
ives
well
perhaps
that
volcanic
eruption
jarred
them
so
that
they
jumped
for
it
pretty
wild
theory
that
said
edwards
no
wilder
than
the
facts
as
you
give
them
was
the
retort
that
so
admitted
the
ensign
gloomily
but
how
about
pestilence
suggested
barnett
maybe
they
died
fast
and
the
last
survivor
after
the
bodies
of
the
rest
were
overboard
got
delirious
and
jumped
after
them
not
if
the
galley
fire
was
hot
said
trendon
briefly
no
pestilence
does
work
that
way
did
you
look
at
the
wheel
billy
asked
ives
did
i
there
another
thing
wheel
all
right
but
compass
is
no
good
at
all
it
regularly
bewitched
what
about
the
log
then
could
find
it
anywhere
hunted
high
low
jack
and
the
game
everywhere
except
in
the
big
chest
i
found
in
the
cabin
could
break
into
that
schermerhorn
chest
exclaimed
barnett
then
he
was
aboard
well
he
is
aboard
now
said
the
ensign
grimly
not
in
the
flesh
and
that
all
he
added
suddenly
no
it
is
all
said
barnett
gently
there
something
else
captain
orders
oh
no
captain
parkinson
does
take
enough
stock
in
my
report
to
tell
me
to
withhold
anything
said
edwards
with
a
trace
of
bitterness
in
his
voice
it
nothing
that
i
believe
myself
anyhow
give
a
chance
to
believe
it
said
ives
well
said
the
ensign
hesitantly
there
a
sort
of
atmosphere
about
that
schooner
that
almost
uncanny
oh
you
had
the
shudders
before
you
were
ordered
to
board
bantered
ives
i
know
it
i
have
thought
it
was
one
of
those
fool
presentiments
if
i
were
the
only
one
to
feel
it
but
the
men
were
affected
too
they
kept
together
like
frightened
sheep
and
i
heard
one
say
to
another
boney
feel
like
someone
was
your
nerves
like
a
now
demanded
edwards
plaintively
what
right
has
a
jackie
to
have
nerves
that
strange
enough
about
the
compass
said
barnett
slowly
ours
is
all
right
again
the
schooner
must
have
been
so
near
the
electric
disturbance
that
her
instruments
were
permanently
deranged
that
would
lend
weight
to
the
volcanic
theory
said
carter
so
the
captain
did
take
kindly
to
your
questioned
ives
of
edwards
as
good
as
told
me
i
missed
the
point
of
the
thing
said
the
ensign
flushing
perhaps
he
can
make
more
of
it
himself
at
any
rate
going
to
try
here
he
is
now
trendon
said
the
captain
appearing
you
will
please
to
go
with
me
to
the
schooner
yes
sir
said
the
surgeon
rising
from
his
chair
with
such
alacrity
as
to
draw
from
ives
the
sardonic
comment
why
i
actually
believe
old
trendon
is
excited
for
two
hours
after
the
departure
of
the
captain
and
trendon
there
were
dull
times
on
the
of
the
then
the
surgeon
came
back
to
them
billy
was
right
he
said
but
he
did
tell
us
anything
cried
ives
he
did
clear
up
the
mystery
that
what
said
trendon
one
thing
billy
said
he
added
waxing
unusually
prolix
for
him
was
truer
than
maybe
he
knew
thanks
murmured
the
ensign
what
was
that
you
said
a
living
being
aboard
exact
words
hey
well
what
of
it
exclaimed
the
ensign
excitedly
you
do
mean
you
found
dead
keep
your
temperature
down
my
boy
no
you
were
exactly
right
not
a
living
being
aboard
thanks
for
nothing
retorted
the
ensign
neither
human
nor
other
pursued
trendon
what
food
scattered
around
the
galley
crumbs
on
the
mess
table
ever
see
a
wooden
ship
without
cockroaches
never
particularly
investigated
the
matter
do
believe
such
a
thing
exists
said
ives
not
a
cockroach
on
the
ever
know
of
an
old
hooker
that
was
overrun
with
rats
no
nor
anyone
else
not
above
water
found
a
dozen
dead
rats
no
sound
or
sign
of
a
live
one
on
the
no
rats
no
mice
no
bugs
gentlemen
the
is
a
charnel
ship
no
wonder
billy
tender
nerves
went
wrong
said
ives
with
irrepressible
flippancy
she
probably
haunted
by
cockroach
wraiths
he
have
a
chance
to
see
said
trendon
captain
going
to
put
him
in
charge
by
way
of
apology
then
said
barnett
that
pretty
square
captain
parkinson
wishes
to
see
you
in
his
cabin
edwards
said
an
orderly
coming
in
a
pleasant
voyage
captain
billy
said
ives
sing
out
if
the
goblins
git
yer
fifteen
minutes
later
ensign
edwards
with
a
quartermaster
timmins
the
mate
and
a
crew
was
heading
a
straight
course
toward
his
first
command
with
instructions
to
keep
company
and
watch
for
signals
and
intention
to
break
into
the
chest
and
ferret
out
what
clue
lay
there
if
it
took
dynamite
as
he
boarded
barnett
and
trendon
with
both
of
whom
the
lad
was
a
favourite
came
to
a
sinister
conclusion
it
poison
i
suppose
said
the
first
officer
and
a
mighty
subtle
sort
agreed
trendon
do
like
the
looks
of
it
he
shook
a
solemn
head
do
like
it
for
a
damn
iv
the
second
prize
crew
in
pacific
weather
the
unexpected
so
seldom
happens
as
to
be
a
negligible
quantity
the
met
with
it
on
june
from
some
unaccountable
source
in
that
realm
of
the
trades
came
a
heavy
mist
possibly
volcanic
action
deranging
by
its
electric
and
gaseous
outpourings
the
normal
course
of
the
winds
had
given
birth
to
it
be
that
as
it
may
it
swept
down
upon
the
cruiser
thickening
as
it
approached
until
presently
it
had
spread
a
curtain
between
the
warship
and
its
charge
the
wind
died
until
after
fall
of
night
the
moved
slowly
bellowing
for
the
schooner
but
got
no
reply
once
they
thought
they
heard
a
distant
shout
of
response
but
there
was
no
repetition
probably
does
carry
any
fog
horn
said
carter
bitterly
voicing
a
general
uneasiness
no
log
compass
crazy
without
fog
signal
i
do
like
that
craft
barnett
ought
to
have
been
ordered
to
blow
the
damned
thing
up
as
a
peril
to
the
high
seas
we
pick
her
up
in
the
morning
surely
said
forsythe
this
last
for
ever
nor
did
it
last
long
an
hour
before
midnight
a
pounding
shower
fell
lashing
the
sea
into
phosphorescent
whiteness
it
ceased
and
with
the
growl
of
a
leaping
animal
a
squall
furiously
beset
the
ship
soon
the
great
steel
body
was
plunging
and
heaving
in
the
billows
it
was
a
gloomy
company
about
the
wardroom
table
upon
each
and
all
hung
an
oppression
of
spirit
captain
parkinson
came
from
his
cabin
and
went
on
deck
constitutionally
he
was
a
nervous
and
pessimistic
man
with
a
fixed
belief
in
the
conspiracy
of
events
banded
for
the
undoing
of
him
and
his
blind
or
dubious
conditions
racked
his
soul
but
real
danger
found
him
not
only
prepared
but
even
eager
now
his
face
was
a
picture
of
foreboding
parky
looks
as
if
davy
jones
was
pulling
on
his
string
observed
the
flippant
ives
to
his
neighbour
worrying
about
the
schooner
hope
billy
edwards
saw
or
heard
or
felt
that
squall
coming
replied
forsythe
giving
expression
to
the
anxiety
that
all
felt
he
a
good
sailor
man
said
ives
and
that
a
staunch
little
schooner
by
the
way
she
handled
herself
oh
it
will
be
all
right
said
carter
confidently
the
moderating
now
but
there
no
telling
how
far
out
of
the
course
this
may
have
blown
him
barnett
came
down
dripping
anything
new
asked
trendon
the
navigating
officer
shook
his
head
nothing
but
the
captain
in
a
state
of
mind
he
said
what
wrong
with
him
the
schooner
seems
possessed
with
the
notion
that
there
something
wrong
with
her
are
you
feeling
a
little
that
way
yourself
said
forsythe
i
am
i
take
a
look
around
before
i
turn
in
he
left
behind
him
a
silent
crowd
his
return
was
prompt
and
swift
come
on
deck
he
said
every
man
leaped
as
to
an
order
there
was
that
in
forsythe
voice
which
stung
the
weather
had
cleared
somewhat
though
scudding
wrack
still
blew
across
them
to
the
westward
the
ship
rolled
heavily
of
the
sea
naught
was
visible
except
the
arching
waves
but
in
the
sky
they
beheld
again
with
a
sickening
sense
of
disaster
that
pale
and
lovely
glow
which
had
so
bewildered
them
two
nights
before
the
aurora
cried
mcguire
the
paymaster
oh
certainly
replied
ives
with
sarcasm
dead
in
the
west
common
spot
for
the
aurora
particularly
on
the
edge
of
the
south
seas
where
they
are
thick
then
what
is
it
nobody
had
an
answer
carter
hastened
forward
and
returned
to
report
it
electrical
anyway
said
carter
the
compass
is
queer
again
edwards
ought
to
be
close
to
the
solution
of
it
ventured
ives
this
gale
should
have
blown
him
just
about
to
the
centre
of
interest
if
only
he
is
involved
in
it
said
carter
anxiously
what
could
there
be
to
involve
him
asked
mcguire
i
do
know
said
carter
slowly
somehow
i
feel
as
if
the
desertion
of
the
schooner
was
in
some
formidable
manner
connected
with
that
light
for
perhaps
fifteen
minutes
the
glow
continued
it
seemed
to
be
nearer
at
hand
than
on
the
former
sighting
but
it
took
no
comprehensible
form
then
it
died
away
and
all
was
blackness
again
but
the
officers
of
the
had
long
been
in
troubled
slumber
before
the
sensitive
compass
regained
its
exact
balance
and
with
the
shifting
wind
to
mislead
her
the
cruiser
had
wandered
by
morning
no
man
might
know
how
far
from
her
course
all
day
long
of
june
the
baffled
by
patches
of
mist
and
moving
patrolled
the
empty
seas
without
sighting
the
lost
schooner
the
evening
brought
an
envelope
of
fog
again
and
presently
a
light
breeze
came
up
from
the
north
an
hour
of
it
had
failed
to
disperse
the
mist
when
there
was
borne
down
to
the
warship
a
flapping
sound
as
of
great
wings
the
flapping
grew
louder
waned
ceased
and
from
the
lookout
came
a
hail
ship
lights
three
points
on
the
starboard
quarter
what
do
you
make
it
out
to
be
came
the
query
from
below
green
light
all
i
can
see
sir
there
was
a
pause
there
her
port
light
now
looks
to
be
turning
and
bearing
down
on
us
sir
coming
dead
for
us
the
man
voice
rose
close
aboard
two
ship
lengths
away
as
for
a
prearranged
scene
the
parted
there
loomed
silently
and
swiftly
the
down
she
bore
upon
the
greater
vessel
until
it
seemed
as
if
she
must
ram
but
all
the
time
she
was
veering
to
windward
and
now
she
ran
into
the
wind
with
a
castanet
rattle
of
sails
so
close
aboard
was
she
that
the
eager
eyes
of
uncle
sam
men
peered
down
upon
her
empty
decks
for
she
was
void
of
life
behind
the
cruiser
blanketing
she
paid
off
very
slowly
but
presently
caught
the
breeze
full
and
again
whitened
the
water
at
her
prow
forgetting
regulations
ives
hailed
loudly
ahoy
ahoy
billy
edwards
no
sound
no
animate
motion
came
from
aboard
that
apparition
as
she
fell
astern
a
shudder
of
horror
ran
across
the
a
wraith
ship
peopled
with
skeletons
would
have
been
less
dreadful
to
their
sight
than
the
brisk
and
active
desolation
of
the
heeling
schooner
been
deserted
since
early
last
night
said
trendon
hoarsely
how
can
you
tell
that
asked
barnett
both
sails
reefed
down
ready
for
that
squall
been
no
weather
since
to
call
for
reefs
must
have
quit
her
during
the
squall
then
they
jumped
cried
carter
for
i
saw
her
boats
it
believable
neither
was
the
other
said
trendon
grimly
a
hurried
succession
of
orders
stopped
further
discussion
for
the
time
ives
was
sent
aboard
the
schooner
to
lower
sail
and
report
he
came
back
with
a
staggering
dearth
of
information
the
boats
were
all
there
the
ship
was
intact
as
intact
as
when
billy
edwards
had
taken
charge
but
the
cheery
lovable
ensign
and
his
men
had
vanished
without
trace
or
clue
as
to
the
how
or
the
wherefore
they
might
rack
their
brains
without
guessing
there
was
the
beginning
of
a
log
in
the
ensign
handwriting
which
ives
had
found
with
high
excitement
and
read
with
bitter
disappointment
had
squall
from
northeast
it
ran
double
reefed
her
and
she
took
it
nicely
seems
a
seaworthy
quick
ship
further
search
for
log
no
result
have
ordered
one
of
crew
who
is
a
bit
of
a
mechanic
to
work
at
the
chest
till
he
gets
it
open
he
reports
marks
on
the
lock
as
if
somebody
had
been
trying
to
pick
it
before
him
there
was
no
further
entry
trendon
is
right
said
barnett
whatever
happened
and
god
only
knows
what
it
could
have
been
it
happened
just
after
the
squall
just
about
the
time
of
the
strange
glow
cried
ives
it
was
decided
that
two
men
and
a
petty
officer
should
be
sent
aboard
the
to
make
her
fast
with
a
cable
and
remain
on
board
over
night
but
when
the
order
was
given
the
men
hung
back
one
of
them
protested
brokenly
that
he
was
sick
trendon
after
examination
reported
to
the
captain
case
of
blue
funk
sir
might
as
well
be
sick
good
for
nothing
others
are
much
better
who
was
to
be
in
charge
congdon
replied
the
doctor
naming
one
of
the
petty
officers
he
my
coxswain
said
captain
parkinson
a
man
i
can
hardly
believe
that
he
is
afraid
we
see
illustration
a
man
who
was
a
bit
of
a
mechanic
was
set
to
work
to
open
the
chest
congdon
was
sent
for
you
ordered
aboard
the
schooner
for
the
night
congdon
said
the
captain
yes
sir
is
there
any
reason
why
you
do
not
wish
to
go
the
man
hesitated
looking
miserable
finally
he
blurted
out
not
without
a
certain
dignity
i
obey
orders
sir
speak
out
my
man
urged
the
captain
kindly
well
sir
it
edwards
then
you
could
scare
him
off
a
ship
sir
unless
it
was
something
something
he
stopped
failing
of
the
word
you
know
what
edwards
was
sir
for
pluck
he
concluded
cried
the
captain
sharply
what
do
you
mean
the
schooner
got
him
sir
you
do
make
no
doubt
of
that
do
you
sir
the
man
spoke
in
a
hushed
voice
with
a
shrinking
glance
back
of
him
will
you
go
aboard
under
mr
ives
anywhere
my
officer
goes
i
go
and
gladly
sir
ives
was
sent
aboard
in
charge
for
that
night
in
a
light
breeze
the
two
ships
lay
close
together
the
schooner
riding
jauntily
astern
but
not
until
morning
illumined
the
world
of
waters
did
the
people
feel
confident
that
the
would
not
vanish
away
from
their
ken
like
a
shape
of
the
mist
v
the
disappearance
when
barnett
come
on
deck
very
early
in
the
morning
of
june
he
found
trendon
already
up
and
staring
moodily
out
at
the
as
the
night
was
calm
the
tow
had
made
fair
time
toward
their
port
in
the
hawaiian
group
the
surgeon
was
muttering
something
which
seemed
to
barnett
to
be
in
a
foreign
tongue
thought
out
any
clue
doctor
asked
the
first
officer
pshaw
celimene
no
muttered
trendon
i
got
it
the
got
what
what
about
her
parallel
case
said
trendon
sailed
from
new
york
back
in
the
seventies
seven
weeks
out
was
found
derelict
everything
in
perfect
order
captain
wife
hem
on
the
machine
boats
all
accounted
for
no
sign
of
struggle
log
written
to
within
hours
what
became
of
the
crew
wish
i
could
tell
you
might
help
to
unravel
our
tangle
he
shook
his
head
in
sudden
unwonted
passion
evidently
there
something
criminal
in
her
record
said
barnett
frowning
at
the
fusty
schooner
astern
otherwise
the
name
would
be
painted
out
painted
out
long
ago
see
how
rusty
it
is
schermerhorn
work
maybe
replied
trendon
secret
expedition
remember
in
the
name
of
wonders
why
should
he
do
it
secret
expedition
was
it
that
true
said
the
other
thoughtfully
it
quite
possible
captain
wishes
to
see
both
of
you
gentlemen
in
the
ward
room
if
you
please
came
a
message
below
they
found
all
the
officers
gathered
captain
parkinson
was
pacing
up
and
down
in
agitation
gentlemen
he
said
we
are
facing
a
problem
which
so
far
as
i
know
is
without
parallel
it
is
my
intention
to
bring
the
schooner
which
we
have
in
tow
to
port
at
honolulu
in
the
present
unsettled
weather
we
can
not
continue
to
tow
her
i
wish
two
officers
to
take
charge
under
the
circumstances
i
shall
issue
no
orders
the
duty
must
be
voluntary
instantly
every
man
from
the
veteran
trendon
to
the
youthful
paymaster
volunteered
that
is
what
i
expected
said
captain
parkinson
quietly
but
i
have
still
a
word
to
say
i
make
no
doubt
in
my
own
mind
that
the
schooner
has
twice
been
beset
by
the
gravest
of
perils
nothing
less
would
have
driven
edwards
from
his
post
all
of
us
who
know
him
will
appreciate
that
nor
can
i
free
myself
from
the
darkest
forebodings
as
to
his
fate
and
that
of
his
companions
but
as
to
the
nature
of
the
peril
i
am
unable
to
make
any
conjecture
worthy
of
consideration
has
anyone
a
theory
to
offer
there
was
a
dead
silence
barnett
trendon
mr
ives
is
there
not
possibly
some
connection
between
the
unexplained
light
which
we
have
twice
seen
and
the
double
desertion
of
the
ship
suggested
the
first
officer
after
a
pause
i
have
asked
myself
that
over
and
over
whatever
the
source
of
the
light
and
however
near
to
it
the
schooner
may
have
been
she
is
evidently
unharmed
yes
sir
said
barnett
that
seems
to
vitiate
that
explanation
i
thank
you
gentlemen
for
the
promptitude
of
your
offers
continued
the
captain
in
this
respect
you
make
my
duty
the
more
difficult
i
shall
accept
ives
because
of
his
familiarity
with
sailing
craft
and
with
these
seas
his
eyes
ranged
the
group
i
beg
your
pardon
captain
parkinson
eagerly
put
in
the
paymaster
but
i
handled
a
schooner
yacht
for
several
years
and
i
appreciate
the
chance
of
very
well
mcguire
you
shall
be
the
second
in
command
thank
you
sir
you
gentlemen
will
pick
a
volunteer
crew
and
go
aboard
at
once
spare
no
effort
to
find
records
of
the
schooner
cruise
keep
in
company
and
watch
for
signals
report
at
once
any
discovery
or
unusual
incident
however
slight
not
so
easily
was
a
crew
obtained
having
in
mind
the
excusable
superstition
of
the
men
captain
parkinson
was
unwilling
to
compel
any
of
them
to
the
duty
awed
by
the
mystery
of
their
mates
disappearance
the
sailors
hung
back
finally
by
temptation
of
extra
prize
money
a
complement
was
made
up
at
ten
of
a
puffy
morning
a
new
and
strong
crew
of
nine
men
boarded
the
there
were
no
farewells
among
the
officers
forebodings
weighed
too
heavy
for
such
open
expression
all
the
fates
of
weather
seemed
to
combine
to
part
the
schooner
from
her
convoy
as
before
the
fog
fell
only
to
be
succeeded
by
squally
that
cut
out
the
vista
into
a
checkerboard
pattern
of
visible
sea
and
impenetrable
greyness
before
evening
the
making
slow
way
through
the
mists
had
become
separated
by
a
league
of
waves
from
the
cruiser
one
glimpse
of
her
between
mist
areas
the
caught
at
sunset
then
wind
and
rain
descended
in
furious
volume
from
the
southeast
the
cruiser
immediately
headed
about
following
the
probable
course
of
her
charge
which
would
be
beaten
far
down
to
leeward
it
was
a
gloomy
mess
on
the
warship
in
his
cabin
captain
parkinson
was
frankly
a
condition
which
nothing
but
the
extreme
of
nervous
depression
ever
induced
in
him
for
several
hours
the
rain
fell
and
the
gale
howled
then
the
sky
swiftly
cleared
and
with
the
clearing
there
rose
a
great
cry
of
amaze
from
stem
to
stern
of
the
for
far
toward
the
western
horizon
appeared
such
a
prodigy
as
the
eye
of
no
man
aboard
that
ship
had
ever
beheld
from
a
belt
of
marvellous
glowing
gold
rich
and
splendid
streamers
of
light
spiralled
up
into
the
blackness
of
the
heavens
in
all
the
colours
of
the
spectrum
they
rose
and
fell
blazing
orange
silken
wonderful
translucent
blues
and
shimmering
reds
below
a
broad
band
of
paler
hue
like
sheet
lightning
fixed
to
rigidity
wavered
and
rippled
all
the
auroras
of
the
northland
blended
in
one
could
but
have
paled
away
before
the
splendour
of
that
terrific
celestial
apparition
on
board
the
cruiser
all
hands
stood
petrified
bound
in
a
stricture
of
speechless
wonder
after
the
first
cry
silence
lay
leaden
over
the
ship
it
was
broken
by
a
scream
of
terror
from
forward
the
quartermaster
who
had
been
at
the
wheel
came
clambering
down
the
ladder
and
ran
along
the
deck
his
fingers
splayed
and
stiffened
before
him
in
the
intensity
of
his
panic
the
needle
the
compass
he
shrieked
barnett
ran
to
the
wheel
house
with
trendon
at
his
heels
the
others
followed
the
needle
was
swaying
like
a
cobra
head
and
as
a
head
spits
venom
it
spat
forth
a
thin
stream
of
lucent
fire
then
so
swiftly
it
whirled
that
the
sparks
scattered
from
it
in
a
tiny
shower
it
stopped
quivered
and
curved
itself
upward
until
it
rattled
like
a
fairy
drum
upon
the
glass
shield
barnett
looked
at
trendon
volcanic
he
said
eyes
have
seen
the
coming
of
the
glory
of
the
lord
muttered
the
surgeon
in
his
deep
bass
as
he
looked
forth
upon
the
streaming
radiant
heavens
it
like
nothing
else
in
the
west
the
splendour
and
the
terror
shot
to
the
zenith
barnett
whirled
the
wheel
the
ship
responded
perfectly
i
though
she
might
be
bewitched
too
he
murmured
you
may
heal
her
for
the
light
barnett
said
captain
parkinson
calmly
he
had
come
from
his
cabin
all
his
nervous
depression
gone
in
the
face
of
an
imminent
and
visible
danger
slowly
the
great
mass
of
steel
swung
to
the
unknown
for
an
hour
the
unknown
guided
her
then
fell
blackness
sudden
complete
after
that
radiance
the
dazzled
eye
could
make
out
no
stars
but
the
keen
vision
discerned
something
else
ship
afire
he
shouted
hoarsely
where
away
two
points
to
leeward
near
where
the
light
was
sir
they
turned
their
eyes
to
the
direction
indicated
and
beheld
a
majestic
rolling
volume
of
purple
light
suddenly
a
fiercer
red
shot
it
through
that
no
ship
afire
said
trendon
volcano
in
eruption
and
the
other
asked
the
captain
no
volcano
sir
poor
billy
edwards
wins
his
bet
said
forsythe
in
a
low
voice
god
grant
he
on
earth
to
collect
it
replied
barnett
solemnly
no
one
turned
in
that
night
when
the
sun
of
june
rose
it
showed
an
ocean
bare
of
prospect
except
that
on
the
far
horizon
where
the
chart
showed
no
land
there
rose
a
smudge
of
dirty
rolling
smoke
of
the
schooner
there
was
neither
sign
nor
trace
vi
the
castaways
this
ship
growled
carter
the
second
officer
to
trendon
as
they
stood
watching
the
growing
is
a
worse
of
rumours
than
a
village
that
the
third
we
had
officially
reported
since
breakfast
as
he
said
three
distinct
times
the
had
thrilled
to
an
imminent
discovery
which
upon
nearer
investigation
had
dwindled
to
nothing
more
than
a
floating
fowl
upon
the
heels
of
carter
complaint
came
another
hail
boat
ahoy
three
points
on
the
starboard
bow
if
that
another
gull
muttered
carter
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
my
festive
lookout
the
news
ran
electrically
through
the
cruiser
and
all
eyes
were
strained
for
a
glimpse
of
the
boat
the
ship
swung
away
to
starboard
let
me
know
as
soon
as
you
can
make
her
out
ordered
carter
aye
aye
sir
there
certainly
something
there
said
forsythe
presently
i
can
make
out
a
speck
rising
on
the
waves
bit
o
wreckage
from
barnett
derelict
muttered
trendon
scowling
through
his
glasses
rides
too
high
for
a
spar
or
anything
of
that
sort
said
the
junior
lieutenant
she
a
small
boat
came
in
the
clear
tones
of
the
lookout
down
anyone
in
her
asked
carter
ca
make
out
yet
sir
no
one
in
charge
though
sir
captain
parkinson
appeared
and
carter
pointed
out
the
speck
to
him
yes
give
her
full
speed
said
the
captain
replying
to
a
question
from
the
officer
of
the
deck
forward
leapt
the
swift
cruiser
all
too
slow
for
the
anxious
hearts
of
those
aboard
for
there
was
not
one
of
the
who
did
not
expect
from
this
aimless
traveller
of
desert
seas
at
the
least
a
leading
clue
to
the
riddle
that
oppressed
them
aloft
there
aye
aye
sir
can
you
make
out
her
build
rides
high
like
a
dory
sir
was
there
a
dory
on
the
cried
forsythe
on
her
stern
davits
answered
trendon
it
is
hardly
probable
that
unattached
small
boats
should
be
drifting
about
these
seas
said
captain
parkinson
thoughtfully
if
she
a
dory
she
the
boat
that
what
she
is
said
barnett
you
can
see
her
build
plain
enough
now
barnett
will
you
go
aloft
and
keep
me
posted
said
the
captain
the
executive
officer
climbed
to
join
the
lookout
as
he
ascended
those
below
saw
the
little
craft
rise
high
and
slow
on
a
broad
swell
same
dory
said
trendon
i
swear
to
her
in
constantinople
what
else
could
she
be
muttered
forsythe
somethin
that
looks
like
a
man
in
the
bottom
of
her
sang
out
the
two
of
i
think
for
five
minutes
there
was
stillness
aboard
broken
only
by
an
occasional
conjecture
then
from
aloft
two
men
rolling
in
the
bottom
are
they
alive
no
sir
not
that
i
can
see
the
wind
which
had
been
extremely
variable
since
dawn
now
whipped
around
a
couple
of
points
swinging
the
boat
stern
to
them
barnet
putting
aside
his
glass
for
a
moment
called
down
that
the
one
sir
i
can
make
out
the
name
good
said
the
captain
quietly
we
should
have
news
at
least
ives
or
mcguire
suggested
forsythe
in
low
tones
or
billy
edwards
amended
carter
not
edwards
said
trendon
how
do
you
know
demanded
forsythe
dory
was
aboard
when
we
found
her
the
second
time
after
edwards
had
left
can
you
make
out
which
of
the
men
are
in
her
hailed
the
captain
do
think
it
any
of
our
people
came
the
astonishing
reply
from
barnett
are
you
sure
i
can
see
only
one
man
face
sir
it
is
ives
or
mcguire
he
a
stranger
to
me
it
must
be
one
of
the
crew
then
no
sir
beg
your
parding
called
the
lookout
nothin
like
that
in
our
crew
sir
the
boat
came
down
upon
them
swiftly
soon
the
was
looking
into
her
she
was
of
a
type
common
enough
on
the
high
seas
except
that
a
step
for
a
mast
showed
that
she
had
presumably
been
used
for
skimming
about
open
shores
of
her
passengers
one
lay
forward
prone
and
quiet
a
length
of
sail
cloth
spread
over
him
made
it
impossible
to
see
his
garb
at
his
breast
an
ugly
protuberance
outlined
vaguely
hinted
a
deformity
the
other
sprawled
aft
and
at
a
nearer
sight
of
him
some
of
the
men
broke
out
into
nervous
titters
there
was
some
excuse
for
surely
such
a
scarecrow
had
never
before
been
the
sport
of
wind
and
wave
a
thing
of
shreds
he
was
elaborately
ragged
a
face
overrun
with
a
scrub
of
beard
and
preternaturally
drawn
surmounted
by
a
dirty
cloth
with
a
wide
forbidding
stain
along
the
side
worked
out
the
likeness
to
a
my
god
cackled
forsythe
with
an
hysterical
explosion
and
again
my
god
a
irrepressible
aspiration
of
expectancy
rose
from
the
warship
decks
as
the
stranger
raised
his
haggard
face
turned
eyes
unseeingly
upon
them
and
fell
back
the
forward
occupant
stirred
not
save
as
the
boat
rolled
from
between
decks
someone
called
out
sharply
an
order
in
the
grim
silence
it
seemed
strangely
incongruous
that
the
measured
business
of
a
ship
life
should
be
going
forward
as
usual
something
within
the
newcomer
consciousness
stirred
to
that
voice
of
authority
mechanically
like
some
huge
hideous
toy
he
raised
first
one
arm
then
the
other
and
hitched
himself
halfway
up
on
the
stern
seat
his
mouth
opened
his
face
wrinkled
he
seemed
groping
for
the
meaning
of
a
joke
at
which
he
knew
he
ought
to
laugh
suddenly
from
his
lips
in
surprising
volume
raucous
rasping
yet
with
a
certain
rollicking
deviltry
fit
to
set
the
head
burst
a
chanty
oh
their
coffin
was
their
ship
and
their
grave
it
was
the
sea
high
blow
low
what
care
we
and
the
quarter
that
we
gave
them
was
to
sink
them
in
the
sea
on
the
coast
of
the
high
like
the
mockery
of
a
wail
the
minor
cadence
wavered
through
the
stillness
and
died
away
the
high
barbaree
cried
trendon
you
know
it
asked
the
captain
expectant
of
a
clue
one
of
those
cursed
tunes
you
ca
forget
said
the
surgeon
heard
a
scoundrel
of
a
sing
it
years
ago
down
in
new
zealand
that
was
when
the
fever
rose
on
him
he
pipe
up
used
to
beat
time
with
a
steel
hook
he
wore
in
place
of
a
hand
the
thing
haunted
me
till
i
was
sorry
i
had
let
the
rascal
die
this
creature
might
have
learned
it
from
him
howls
it
out
exactly
like
i
do
see
that
that
helps
us
any
said
forsythe
looking
down
on
the
preparations
that
were
making
to
receive
the
unexpected
guests
with
a
deftness
which
had
made
the
famous
in
the
navy
for
the
niceties
of
seamanship
the
great
cruiser
let
down
her
tackle
as
she
drew
skilfully
alongside
and
made
fast
preparatory
to
lifting
the
dory
gently
to
her
broad
deck
but
before
the
order
came
to
hoist
away
one
of
the
jackies
who
had
gone
down
drew
the
covering
back
from
the
still
figure
forward
and
turned
it
over
with
a
cry
he
shrank
back
and
at
that
the
tension
of
soul
and
mind
on
the
snapped
breaking
into
outcries
and
sudden
sharp
imprecations
the
face
revealed
was
that
of
timmins
the
mate
who
had
sailed
with
the
first
vanished
crew
a
life
preserver
was
fastened
under
his
arms
he
was
dead
i
out
said
the
surgeon
briefly
and
stood
with
mouth
agape
never
had
the
disciplined
performed
a
sea
duty
with
so
ragged
a
routine
as
the
getting
in
of
the
boat
containing
the
live
man
and
the
dead
body
the
dead
seaman
was
reverently
disposed
and
covered
as
to
the
survivor
there
was
some
hesitancy
on
the
part
of
the
captain
who
was
inclined
to
send
him
forward
until
trendon
after
a
swift
scrutiny
suggested
that
for
the
present
at
least
he
be
berthed
aft
they
took
the
stranger
to
edwards
vacant
room
where
trendon
was
closeted
with
him
for
half
an
hour
when
he
emerged
he
was
beset
with
questions
ca
give
any
account
of
himself
yet
said
the
surgeon
weak
and
not
rightly
conscious
what
ails
him
enough
gash
in
his
scalp
fever
thirst
and
exhaustion
nervous
shock
too
i
think
how
came
he
aboard
the
does
he
know
anything
of
billy
was
he
a
did
you
ask
him
about
ives
and
mcguire
how
came
he
in
the
small
boat
where
are
the
rest
now
now
said
the
veteran
chidingly
how
can
i
tell
would
you
have
me
kill
the
man
with
questions
he
left
them
to
look
at
the
body
of
the
mate
not
a
word
had
he
to
say
when
he
returned
only
the
captain
got
anything
out
of
him
but
growling
and
unintelligible
expressions
which
seemed
to
be
objurgatory
and
to
express
bewildered
cogitation
how
long
had
poor
timmins
been
drowned
the
captain
had
asked
him
and
trendon
replied
captain
parkinson
the
man
was
drowned
no
water
in
his
lungs
not
drowned
then
how
came
he
by
his
death
if
i
were
to
diagnose
it
under
any
other
conditions
i
should
say
that
he
had
inhaled
flames
then
the
two
men
stared
at
each
other
in
blank
impotency
meantime
the
scarecrow
was
showing
signs
of
returning
consciousness
and
a
message
was
dispatched
for
the
physician
on
his
way
he
met
barnett
who
asked
and
received
permission
to
accompany
him
the
stranger
was
tossing
restlessly
in
his
bunk
opening
and
shutting
his
parched
mouth
in
silent
piteous
appeal
for
the
water
that
must
still
be
doled
to
him
parsimoniously
i
think
i
try
him
with
a
little
brandy
said
trendon
and
sent
for
the
liquor
barnett
raised
the
patient
while
the
surgeon
held
the
glass
to
his
lips
the
man
hand
rose
wavered
and
clasped
the
glass
all
right
my
friend
take
it
yourself
if
you
like
said
trendon
the
fingers
closed
tremulously
held
the
little
glass
tilted
and
rattled
against
the
teeth
there
was
one
deep
eager
spasm
of
swallowing
then
the
fevered
eyes
opened
upon
the
face
of
the
first
officer
prosit
barnett
said
the
man
in
a
voice
like
the
rasp
of
rusty
metal
the
navy
man
straightened
up
as
from
a
blow
under
the
jaw
be
careful
what
you
are
about
warned
trendon
addressing
his
superior
officer
sharply
for
barnett
had
all
but
let
his
charge
drop
his
face
was
a
puckered
mask
of
amaze
and
incredulity
did
you
hear
him
speak
my
name
or
am
i
dreaming
he
half
whispered
heard
him
plain
enough
who
is
he
the
man
eyes
closed
but
he
smiled
a
little
a
singular
winning
smile
with
that
there
sprung
from
behind
the
brush
of
beard
filling
out
the
deep
lines
of
emaciation
a
memory
to
the
recognition
of
barnett
a
keen
and
gay
countenance
that
whisked
him
back
across
seven
years
time
to
the
days
of
dewey
and
the
philippines
ralph
slade
by
the
lord
he
exclaimed
of
the
cried
trendon
of
the
such
a
fury
of
eagerness
burned
in
the
face
of
barnett
that
trendon
cautioned
him
see
here
barnett
you
not
going
to
fire
a
broadside
of
disturbing
questions
at
my
patient
yet
a
while
he
in
no
condition
but
it
was
from
the
other
that
the
questions
came
opening
his
eyes
he
whispered
the
sailor
where
dead
said
trendon
bluntly
then
breaking
his
own
rule
of
repression
he
asked
did
he
come
off
the
schooner
with
you
picked
him
up
was
the
straining
answer
drifting
the
survivor
looked
around
him
then
into
barnett
face
and
his
mind
too
traversed
the
years
dakota
he
queried
no
i
changed
my
ship
said
barnett
this
is
the
where
the
barnett
shook
his
head
tell
me
begged
slade
wait
till
you
stronger
admonished
trendon
ca
wait
said
the
weak
voice
the
eyes
grew
wild
barnett
tell
him
the
bare
outline
and
make
it
short
said
the
surgeon
we
sighted
the
two
days
ago
she
was
in
good
shape
but
deserted
that
is
we
thought
she
was
deserted
the
man
nodded
eagerly
i
suppose
you
were
aboard
said
barnett
and
trendon
made
a
quick
gesture
of
impatience
and
rebuke
no
said
slade
left
three
four
do
know
how
many
nights
ago
the
officers
looked
at
each
other
go
on
said
trendon
to
his
companion
we
put
a
crew
aboard
in
command
of
an
ensign
continued
barnett
and
picked
up
the
schooner
the
next
night
deserted
you
must
know
about
it
where
is
billy
edwards
never
heard
of
him
whispered
the
other
ives
and
mcguire
then
they
were
there
after
great
god
man
he
cried
his
agitation
breaking
out
pull
yourself
together
give
us
something
to
go
on
mr
barnett
said
the
surgeon
peremptorily
but
the
suggestion
was
working
in
the
sick
man
brain
he
turned
to
the
officers
a
face
of
horror
your
man
edwards
the
crew
they
left
her
in
the
night
what
does
he
mean
cried
barnett
the
light
you
saw
it
yes
we
saw
a
strange
light
answered
trendon
soothingly
slade
half
rose
lost
all
lost
he
cried
and
fell
back
unconscious
trendon
exploded
into
curses
see
what
you
done
to
my
patient
he
fumed
barnett
looked
at
him
with
contrite
eyes
better
get
out
before
he
comes
to
growled
the
surgeon
nice
way
to
treat
a
man
half
dead
of
exhaustion
it
was
nearly
an
hour
before
slade
came
back
to
the
world
again
the
doctor
forbade
him
to
attempt
speech
but
of
one
thing
he
would
not
be
denied
there
was
a
struggle
for
utterance
then
the
volcano
he
rasped
out
dead
ahead
was
the
reply
stand
by
grasped
slade
he
strove
to
rise
to
say
something
further
but
endurance
had
reached
its
limit
the
man
was
utterly
done
trendon
went
on
deck
his
head
sunk
between
his
shoulders
for
a
minute
he
was
in
earnest
talk
with
the
captain
presently
the
engines
slowed
down
and
she
lay
head
to
the
waves
with
just
enough
turn
of
the
screw
to
hold
her
against
the
vii
the
free
lance
by
the
following
afternoon
trendon
reported
his
patient
as
quite
recovered
starved
for
water
proffered
the
surgeon
tissues
fairly
dried
out
soaked
him
up
fed
him
broth
put
him
to
sleep
he
all
right
just
wakes
up
to
eat
then
off
again
like
a
old
wonderful
constitution
the
gentleman
wants
to
know
if
he
can
come
on
deck
sir
saluted
an
orderly
waked
up
eh
come
on
barnett
help
me
boost
him
on
deck
the
two
officers
disappeared
to
return
in
a
moment
with
ralph
slade
nearly
hours
rest
and
skilful
treatment
had
done
wonders
he
was
still
a
trifle
weak
and
uncertain
was
still
a
little
glad
to
lean
on
the
arms
of
his
companions
but
his
eye
was
bright
and
alert
and
his
hollow
cheeks
mounted
a
slight
colour
this
with
the
clothes
lent
him
by
barnett
transformed
his
appearance
and
led
captain
parkinson
to
congratulate
himself
that
he
had
not
obeyed
his
first
impulse
to
send
the
castaway
forward
with
the
men
the
officers
pressed
forward
mighty
glad
to
see
you
out
hope
you
got
your
pins
under
you
again
old
man
i
mighty
glad
we
came
along
the
chorus
of
greeting
was
hearty
enough
but
the
journalist
barely
paid
the
courtesy
of
acknowledgment
his
eye
swept
the
horizon
eagerly
until
it
rested
on
the
cloud
of
volcanic
smoke
billowing
up
across
the
setting
sun
a
sigh
of
relief
escaped
him
where
are
we
he
asked
barnett
i
mean
since
you
picked
me
up
how
long
ago
was
that
anyway
yesterday
replied
the
navigating
officer
we
stood
off
and
on
looking
for
some
of
our
men
then
that
the
same
volcano
barnett
laughed
softly
well
they
are
quite
holding
a
caucus
of
volcanoes
down
in
this
country
one
like
that
is
enough
but
slade
brushed
the
remark
aside
head
for
it
he
cried
excitedly
we
may
be
in
time
there
a
man
on
that
island
a
man
another
not
billy
edwards
not
some
of
our
boys
slade
stared
at
them
bewildered
hold
on
interposed
trendon
authoritatively
what
his
name
he
inquired
of
the
journalist
darrow
replied
the
latter
percy
darrow
do
you
know
him
who
in
kamschatka
is
percy
darrow
demanded
forsythe
why
he
the
assistant
it
a
long
story
of
course
it
a
long
story
there
a
lot
we
want
to
know
interrupted
captain
parkinson
quartermaster
head
for
the
volcano
yonder
slade
we
want
to
know
where
you
came
from
and
why
you
left
the
schooner
and
who
percy
darrow
is
and
there

so
we
just
adjourn
to
the
messroom
and
hear
what
you
can
tell
us
but
there
one
thing
we
all
anxious
to
know
how
came
you
in
the
dory
which
we
found
and
left
on
the
no
later
than
two
days
ago
i
have
set
eyes
on
the
for
well
i
do
know
how
long
but
it
five
days
anyway
perhaps
more
replied
slade
they
stared
at
him
incredulously
oh
i
see
he
burst
out
suddenly
there
were
twin
dories
on
the
schooner
the
other
one
still
there
i
suppose
did
you
find
her
on
the
stern
davits
yes
that
it
then
you
see
when
i
left
captain
parkinson
raised
hand
checked
him
if
you
will
be
so
good
slade
let
us
have
it
all
at
once
after
mess
at
table
the
young
officers
at
a
sharp
hint
from
trendon
conversed
on
indifferent
subjects
until
the
journalist
had
partaken
heartily
of
what
the
physician
allowed
him
slade
ate
with
keen
appreciation
i
tell
you
that
good
he
sighed
when
he
had
finished
real
live
coffee
too
why
gentlemen
i
have
eaten
a
civilised
meal
with
all
the
trimmings
for
over
two
years
doctor
do
you
think
a
little
of
the
real
stuff
would
hurt
me
it
a
pretty
dry
yarning
one
glass
growled
the
surgeon
no
more
scotch
then
voted
slade
the
higher
the
better
the
steward
brought
a
tall
glass
with
ice
in
which
the
newcomer
mixed
his
drink
then
for
quite
a
minute
he
sat
silent
staring
at
the
table
his
fingers
aimlessly
rubbing
into
spots
of
wetness
the
water
beads
as
they
gathered
on
the
outside
of
his
glass
suddenly
he
looked
up
i
do
know
how
to
begin
he
confessed
it
too
confounded
improbable
i
hardly
believe
it
myself
now
that
i
sitting
here
in
human
clothes
surrounded
by
human
beings
old
scrubs
and
the
nigger
and
handy
solomon
and
the
professor
and
the
chest
and
the
well
they
were
real
enough
when
i
was
caught
in
the
mess
but
i
warn
you
you
are
not
going
to
believe
me
and
hanged
if
i
blame
you
a
bit
we
seen
marvels
ourselves
in
the
last
few
days
encouraged
captain
parkinson
fire
ahead
man
advised
barnett
impatiently
just
begin
at
the
beginning
and
let
it
go
at
that
slade
sipped
at
his
glass
reflectively
well
said
he
at
length
the
best
way
to
begin
is
to
show
you
how
i
happened
to
be
mixed
up
in
it
at
all
the
officers
unconsciously
relaxed
into
attitudes
of
greater
ease
overhead
the
lamps
swayed
gently
to
the
swell
the
dull
throb
of
the
screw
pulsated
stewards
clad
in
white
moved
noiselessly
filling
the
glasses
deferentially
striking
lights
for
the
smokers
clearing
away
the
last
dishes
of
the
repast
i
a
reporter
by
choice
and
a
detective
by
instinct
began
slade
with
startling
abruptness
furthermore
i
pretty
well
off
i
what
they
call
a
free
lance
for
i
have
no
regular
desk
on
any
of
the
journals
i
generally
turn
my
stuff
in
to
the
because
they
treat
me
well
in
return
it
is
pretty
well
understood
between
us
that
to
use
my
judgment
in
regard
to
and
that
they
stand
back
of
me
for
expenses
you
see
i
been
with
them
quite
a
while
he
looked
around
the
circle
as
though
in
appeal
to
the
comprehension
of
his
audience
some
of
the
men
nodded
others
sipped
from
their
glasses
or
drew
at
their
cigars
i
loaf
around
here
and
there
in
the
world
having
a
good
time
travelling
visiting
fooling
around
every
once
in
a
while
something
interests
me
the
thing
is
a
sort
of
instinct
i
run
it
down
if
it
a
good
story
i
send
it
in
that
all
there
is
to
it
he
laughed
slightly
you
see
i
a
sort
of
magazine
writer
in
method
but
my
stuff
is
newspaper
stuff
also
the
game
suits
me
that
why
i
play
it
why
i
here
i
have
to
tell
you
about
myself
this
way
so
you
will
understand
how
i
came
to
be
mixed
up
in
this
matter
i
remember
commented
barnett
that
when
you
came
aboard
the
you
had
a
little
trouble
making
captain
arnold
see
it
he
turned
to
the
others
with
a
laugh
he
had
all
kinds
of
papers
of
ancient
date
but
nothing
modern
letter
from
the
dated
five
years
back
recommendations
to
everybody
on
earth
except
captain
arnold
certificate
of
bravery
in
apache
campaign
bank
identifications
and
all
the
rest
you
the
correspondent
and
maybe
not
said
the
captain
do
see
anything
here
to
prove
it
slade
argued
an
hour
no
go
remember
how
you
caught
him
he
inquired
of
slade
the
reporter
grinned
assent
after
the
old
man
had
turned
him
down
for
good
slade
fished
down
in
his
warbag
and
hauled
out
an
old
tattered
document
from
an
oilskin
case
on
a
minute
said
he
old
shellback
i
proved
to
you
that
i
can
write
and
i
proved
to
you
that
i
have
fought
and
now
here
prove
to
you
that
i
can
sail
if
writing
fighting
and
sailing
do
fit
me
adequately
to
report
any
little
disturbances
your
antiquated
washboiler
may
blunder
into
i
go
to
raising
cabbages
with
that
he
presented
a
master
certificate
where
did
you
get
it
anyway
i
never
found
out
passed
as
on
the
great
lakes
replied
slade
briefly
well
the
spunk
and
the
certificate
finished
the
captain
he
was
an
old
square
rigger
himself
in
the
civil
war
so
much
for
myself
slade
continued
as
for
the
part
two
the
brass
bound
chest
the
story
told
by
ralph
slade
free
lance
to
the
officers
of
the
united
states
cruiser
i
the
barbary
coast
a
coincidence
got
me
aboard
her
i
tell
you
how
it
was
one
evening
late
i
was
just
coming
out
of
a
dark
alley
on
the
barbary
coast
san
francisco
you
know
the
water
front
where
you
can
hear
more
tongues
than
at
port
said
see
stranger
sights
and
meet
adventure
with
the
joyous
certainty
of
mediaeval
times
i
been
down
there
hunting
up
a
man
reported
by
a
of
my
acquaintance
to
have
just
returned
from
a
two
years
whaling
voyage
he
been
shanghaied
aboard
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
worth
nearly
a
million
dollars
landed
in
the
city
without
a
cent
could
get
nobody
to
believe
him
nor
trust
him
to
the
extent
of
a
telegram
east
laughed
at
his
yarn
but
i
believe
it
was
true
good
copy
anyway
just
at
the
turn
of
the
alley
i
nearly
bumped
into
two
men
on
the
barbary
coast
you
do
pass
men
in
narrow
places
until
you
have
reconnoitered
a
little
i
pulled
up
thanking
fortune
that
they
had
not
seen
me
the
first
words
were
uttered
in
a
voice
i
knew
well
you
all
heard
of
karl
augustus
schermerhorn
he
did
some
big
things
and
had
in
mind
still
bigger
i
met
him
some
time
before
in
connection
with
his
telepathy
and
wireless
waves
theory
it
was
picturesque
stuff
for
my
purpose
but
was
in
it
with
what
the
old
fellow
had
really
done
he
showed
me
well
that
does
matter
the
point
is
that
good
staid
or
rather
schermerhorn
was
standing
at
midnight
in
a
dark
alley
on
the
barbary
coast
in
san
francisco
talking
to
an
individual
whose
facial
outline
at
least
was
not
ornamental
my
curiosity
or
professional
instinct
whichever
you
please
was
all
aroused
i
flattened
myself
against
the
wall
the
first
remark
i
lost
the
reply
came
to
me
in
a
shrill
falsetto
so
grotesque
was
the
effect
of
this
treble
from
a
bulk
so
squat
and
broad
and
hairy
as
the
silhouette
before
me
that
i
almost
laughed
aloud
i
guess
you
made
no
mistake
on
that
i
her
master
and
her
owner
too
well
i
haf
been
told
you
might
rent
her
said
the
doctor
rent
her
mimicked
the
falsetto
well
that
hell
yes
her
he
laughed
again
doch
recht
the
doctor
was
plainly
at
the
end
of
his
practical
resources
after
waiting
a
moment
for
something
more
definite
the
falsetto
inquired
rather
drily
how
long
what
to
what
for
who
are
you
anyway
i
am
schermerhorn
the
latter
answered
seen
pieces
about
you
in
the
papers
how
many
men
haf
you
in
the
crew
me
and
the
mate
and
the
cook
and
four
hands
and
you
could
go
soon
soon
as
you
want
i
go
i
wish
to
leaf
if
i
can
get
the
crew
together
i
might
make
it
but
say
let
not
hang
out
here
in
this
run
of
darkness
come
over
to
the
grog
shop
yonder
where
we
can
sit
down
to
my
relief
for
my
curiosity
was
fully
aroused
movements
are
usually
productive
this
proposal
was
vetoed
no
no
cried
the
doctor
with
some
haste
this
iss
well
somebody
might
oferhear
the
huge
figure
stirred
into
an
attitude
of
close
attention
after
a
pause
the
falsetto
asked
deliberately
where
we
goin
i
brefer
not
to
say
h
how
long
a
cruise
i
want
to
rent
your
schooner
and
your
crew
remain
h
how
long
that
likely
to
be
maybe
a
few
months
maybe
seferal
years
h
unknown
port
unknown
cruise
see
here
anything
crooked
in
this
no
no
not
at
all
it
iss
simply
business
of
my
own
not
that
i
care
commented
the
other
easily
only
risks
is
worth
paying
for
there
shall
not
be
risk
pearls
likely
hazarded
the
other
without
much
heed
to
the
assurance
them
jap
gunboats
is
getting
pretty
hard
to
dodge
of
late
years
however
i
dodged
before
now
as
to
pay
how
mooch
iss
your
boat
worth
i
could
almost
follow
the
man
thoughts
as
he
pondered
how
much
he
dared
ask
well
you
see
for
a
proposition
like
that
do
know
where
going
when
we
going
to
get
back
and
them
gunboats
how
would
a
hundred
and
a
month
strike
you
double
it
up
i
want
you
to
do
ass
i
say
and
i
will
also
give
your
crew
double
wages
bud
i
want
goot
men
who
will
stay
and
who
will
keep
the
mouth
shut
gosh
all
they
go
to
hell
with
you
for
that
now
you
can
get
all
you
want
of
adams
marsh
tell
them
it
iss
for
me
brovisions
for
three
years
anyhow
be
ready
to
sail
tide
turns
at
eight
in
the
evening
i
will
send
some
effects
in
the
morning
the
master
hesitated
that
all
right
doctor
but
how
do
i
know
it
all
right
maybe
by
morning
you
change
your
mind
that
can
not
be
my
plans
are
all
it
the
usual
thing
to
pay
something
ach
but
yes
i
haf
forgot
darrow
told
me
i
will
make
you
a
check
let
us
go
to
the
table
of
which
you
spoke
they
moved
away
still
talking
i
did
not
dare
follow
them
into
the
light
for
i
feared
that
the
doctor
would
recognise
me
i
have
given
my
eye
teeth
though
to
have
gathered
the
name
of
the
schooner
or
that
of
her
master
as
it
was
i
hung
around
until
the
two
had
emerged
from
the
corner
saloon
they
paused
outside
still
talking
earnestly
i
ventured
a
hasty
interview
with
the
did
you
notice
the
two
men
who
were
sitting
at
the
middle
table
i
asked
him
sure
said
he
shoving
me
my
glass
of
beer
know
them
i
inquired
never
laid
eyes
on
before
old
chap
looked
like
a
sort
of
corn
doctor
or
corner
other
was
probably
one
of
these
longshore
abalone
men
thanks
i
muttered
and
dodged
out
again
leaving
the
beer
untouched
i
cursed
myself
for
a
blunderer
when
i
got
to
the
street
the
two
men
had
disappeared
i
should
have
shadowed
the
captain
to
his
vessel
the
affair
interested
me
greatly
apparently
schermerhorn
was
about
to
go
on
a
long
voyage
i
prided
myself
on
being
fairly
up
to
date
in
regard
to
the
plans
of
those
who
interested
the
public
and
the
public
at
that
time
was
vastly
interested
in
schermerhorn
i
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
world
had
imagined
him
anchored
safely
in
philadelphia
immersed
in
chemical
research
here
he
bobbed
up
at
the
other
end
of
the
continent
making
shady
bargains
with
obscure
shipping
captains
and
paying
a
big
premium
for
absolute
secrecy
it
looked
good
accordingly
i
was
out
early
the
next
morning
i
had
not
much
to
go
by
schooners
are
as
plenty
as
tadpoles
in
san
francisco
harbour
however
i
was
sure
i
could
easily
recognise
that
falsetto
voice
and
i
knew
where
the
supplies
were
to
be
purchased
adams
marsh
are
a
large
firm
and
cautious
i
knew
better
than
to
make
direct
inquiries
or
to
appear
in
the
salesroom
but
by
hanging
around
the
door
of
the
shipping
room
i
soon
had
track
of
the
large
orders
to
be
sent
that
day
in
this
manner
i
had
no
great
difficulty
in
following
a
truck
to
pier
nor
to
identify
a
consignment
to
captain
ezra
selover
as
probably
that
of
which
i
was
in
search
the
mate
was
in
charge
of
the
stowage
so
i
could
not
be
quite
sure
here
however
was
a
schooner
of
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
tons
burden
i
looked
her
over
you
all
acquainted
with
the
and
the
perfection
of
her
lines
you
have
not
known
her
under
captain
ezra
selover
she
was
the
cleanest
ship
i
ever
saw
do
know
how
he
accomplished
it
with
a
crew
of
four
and
the
cook
but
he
did
the
deck
looked
as
though
it
had
been
holystoned
every
morning
by
a
crew
of
jackies
the
stays
were
whipped
and
tarred
the
mast
and
every
foot
of
running
gear
coiled
down
shipshape
and
bristol
fashion
there
was
a
good
deal
of
brass
about
her
it
shone
like
gold
and
i
do
believe
she
owned
an
inch
of
paint
that
was
either
fresh
or
i
gazed
for
some
time
at
this
marvel
it
unusual
enough
anywhere
but
aboard
a
california
hooker
it
is
little
short
of
miraculous
the
crew
had
all
turned
up
apparently
and
a
swarm
of
stevedores
were
hustling
every
sort
of
provisions
supplies
stock
spars
lines
and
canvas
down
into
the
hold
it
was
a
rush
job
and
that
mate
was
having
his
hands
full
i
did
wonder
at
his
language
nor
at
his
looks
both
of
which
were
somewhat
mussed
up
then
almost
at
my
elbow
i
heard
that
shrill
falsetto
squeal
and
turned
just
in
time
to
see
the
captain
ascend
the
after
gangplank
he
was
probably
the
most
dishevelled
and
untidy
man
i
ever
laid
my
eyes
on
his
hair
and
beard
were
not
only
long
but
tangled
and
unkempt
and
grew
so
far
toward
each
other
as
barely
to
expose
a
strip
of
dirty
brown
skin
his
shoulders
were
bowed
and
enormous
his
arms
hung
like
a
gorilla
palms
turned
slightly
outwards
on
his
head
was
jammed
a
linen
boating
hat
that
had
once
been
white
gaping
away
from
his
hairy
chest
was
a
faded
dingy
checked
cotton
shirt
that
had
once
been
brown
and
white
his
blue
trousers
were
spotted
and
splashed
with
dusty
stains
he
was
chewing
tobacco
a
figure
more
in
contrast
to
the
exquisitely
neat
vessel
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
the
captain
mounted
the
gangplank
with
a
steadiness
that
disproved
my
first
suspicion
of
his
having
been
on
a
drunk
he
glanced
aloft
cast
a
speculative
eye
on
the
stevedores
trooping
across
the
waist
of
the
ship
and
ascended
to
the
where
the
mate
stood
leaning
over
the
rail
and
uttering
directed
curses
from
between
lips
there
the
big
man
roamed
aimlessly
on
what
seemed
to
be
a
tour
of
casual
inspection
once
he
stopped
to
breathe
on
the
brass
binnacle
and
to
rub
it
bright
with
the
dirtiest
red
bandana
handkerchief
i
ever
want
to
see
his
actions
amused
me
the
discrepancy
between
his
personal
habits
and
his
particularity
in
the
matter
of
his
surroundings
was
exceedingly
interesting
i
have
often
noticed
that
such
discrepancies
seem
to
indicate
exceptional
characters
as
i
watched
him
his
whole
frame
stiffened
the
long
gorilla
arms
contracted
the
hairy
head
sunk
forward
in
the
tenseness
of
a
serpent
ready
to
strike
he
uttered
a
shrill
falsetto
shriek
that
brought
to
a
standstill
every
stevedore
on
the
job
and
sprang
forward
to
seize
his
mate
by
the
shoulder
evidently
the
grasp
hurt
i
can
believe
it
might
from
those
huge
hands
the
man
wrenched
himself
about
with
an
oath
of
inquiry
and
pain
i
could
hear
one
side
of
what
followed
the
captain
tones
carried
clearly
but
the
grumble
and
growl
of
the
mate
were
indistinguishable
at
that
distance
how
far
is
it
to
the
side
of
the
ship
you
hound
of
hell
shrieked
the
captain
mumble
surprised
for
an
answer
well
i
tell
you
you
it
just
two
fathom
from
where
you
stand
just
two
fathom
how
long
would
it
take
you
to
walk
there
how
long
just
about
six
seconds
there
and
back
you
i
wo
bother
with
all
the
epithets
although
by
now
i
know
captain
selover
vocabulary
fairly
well
and
you
could
take
six
seconds
off
to
spit
over
the
side
could
walk
two
fathom
had
to
spit
on
my
did
you
rumble
from
the
mate
no
by
god
you
wo
call
up
any
of
the
crew
you
get
a
swab
and
do
it
yourself
you
get
a
swab
and
get
down
on
your
knees
damn
you
i
teach
you
to
be
lazy
the
mate
said
something
again
it
do
matter
if
we
ai
under
way
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
is
clean
if
the
waist
ai
and
nobody
but
a
damn
misbegotten
would
spit
on
deck
anyhow
from
this
captain
selover
went
on
into
a
good
cussing
out
to
the
great
joy
of
the
stevedores
the
mate
stood
it
pretty
well
but
there
comes
a
time
when
further
talk
is
useless
even
in
regard
to
a
most
heinous
offense
and
of
course
as
you
know
the
mate
could
hardly
consider
himself
very
seriously
at
fault
why
the
ship
was
not
yet
at
sea
and
in
all
the
clutter
of
charging
he
began
to
answer
back
in
a
moment
it
was
a
quarrel
abruptly
it
was
a
fight
the
mate
marked
selover
beneath
the
left
eye
the
captain
with
beautiful
simplicity
crushed
his
antagonist
in
his
squeeze
carried
him
to
the
side
of
the
vessel
and
dropped
him
limp
and
beaten
to
the
pier
and
the
mate
was
a
good
stout
specimen
of
a
too
then
the
captain
rushed
below
emerging
after
an
instant
with
a
chest
which
he
flung
after
his
subordinate
it
was
followed
a
moment
later
by
a
stream
of
small
stuff
mingled
with
language
projected
through
an
open
this
in
turn
ceased
the
captain
reappeared
with
a
pail
and
brush
scrubbed
feverishly
at
the
offending
spot
mopped
it
dry
with
that
same
old
red
bandana
handkerchief
glared
about
him
and
abruptly
became
as
serene
and
placid
as
a
noon
calm
he
took
up
the
direction
of
the
stevedores
it
was
all
most
astounding
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
the
mate
he
looked
toward
the
ship
once
or
twice
thought
better
of
it
and
began
to
pick
up
his
effects
muttering
savagely
in
a
moment
or
so
he
threw
his
chest
aboard
an
outgoing
truck
and
departed
it
was
now
nearly
noon
and
i
was
just
in
the
way
of
going
for
something
to
eat
when
i
caught
sight
of
another
dray
laden
with
boxes
and
crated
affairs
which
i
recognised
as
scientific
apparatus
it
was
followed
in
quick
succession
by
three
others
ignorant
as
i
was
of
the
requirements
of
a
scientist
my
common
sense
told
me
this
could
be
no
exploring
outfit
i
revised
my
first
intention
of
going
to
the
club
and
bought
a
sandwich
or
two
at
the
corner
coffee
house
i
do
know
why
but
even
then
the
affair
seemed
big
with
mystery
with
the
portent
of
tragedy
perhaps
the
smell
of
tar
was
in
my
nostrils
and
the
sea
called
it
has
always
possessed
for
me
an
extraordinary
allurement
a
little
after
two
a
cab
drove
to
the
after
gangplank
and
stopped
from
it
alighted
a
young
man
of
whom
i
shall
later
have
occasion
to
tell
you
more
followed
by
schermerhorn
the
young
man
carried
only
a
light
leather
serviette
such
as
students
use
abroad
while
the
doctor
fairly
staggered
under
the
weight
of
a
square
chest
without
handles
the
singularity
of
this
unequal
division
of
labour
struck
me
at
once
it
struck
also
one
of
the
dock
men
who
ran
forward
eager
for
a
tip
kin
i
carry
th
box
for
you
boss
he
asked
at
the
same
time
reaching
for
it
the
doctor
thin
figure
seemed
fairly
to
shrink
at
the
idea
no
no
he
cried
it
iss
not
for
you
to
carry
he
hastened
up
the
gangplank
clutching
the
chest
close
at
the
top
captain
selover
met
him
hello
doctor
he
squeaked
here
in
good
time
we
busy
you
see
let
me
carry
your
chest
for
you
no
no
schermerhorn
fairly
glared
it
almighty
heavy
insisted
the
captain
let
me
give
you
a
hand
you
must
not
emphatically
ordered
the
scientist
where
iss
the
cabin
he
disappeared
down
the
companionway
clasping
his
precious
load
the
young
man
remained
on
deck
to
superintend
the
stowing
of
the
scientific
goods
and
the
personal
baggage
all
this
time
i
had
been
thinking
busily
i
remembered
distinctly
one
other
instance
when
schermerhorn
had
disappeared
he
came
back
inscrutably
but
within
a
week
his
results
on
aerial
photography
were
public
property
i
told
myself
that
in
the
present
instance
his
lavish
use
of
money
the
elaborate
nature
of
his
preparations
the
evident
secrecy
of
the
expedition
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
he
had
negotiated
for
the
vessel
only
the
day
before
setting
sail
the
importance
of
personal
supervision
as
proved
by
the
fact
that
he
notoriously
impractical
in
practical
matters
and
notoriously
disliking
anything
to
do
with
business
had
conducted
the
affair
himself
instead
of
delegating
it
why
gentlemen
do
you
see
that
all
this
was
more
than
enough
to
wake
me
up
body
and
soul
suddenly
i
came
to
a
definite
resolution
captain
selover
had
descended
to
the
pier
i
approached
him
you
need
a
mate
said
i
he
looked
me
over
perhaps
he
admitted
where
your
man
right
here
said
i
his
eyes
widened
a
little
otherwise
he
showed
no
sign
of
surprise
i
cursed
my
clothes
fortunately
i
had
my
master
certificate
with
me
i
passed
on
the
great
lakes
i
always
carry
that
sort
of
document
on
the
chance
that
it
may
come
handy
it
chanced
to
have
a
couple
of
naval
endorsements
results
of
the
late
war
look
here
i
said
before
i
gave
it
to
him
you
do
believe
in
me
my
clothes
are
too
good
that
all
right
they
all
i
have
that
are
good
i
broke
i
came
down
here
wondering
whether
i
better
throw
myself
in
the
drink
you
look
like
a
dude
he
squeaked
where
did
you
ever
ship
i
handed
him
my
certificate
the
endorsements
from
admiral
keays
and
captain
arnold
impressed
him
he
stared
at
me
again
and
a
gleam
of
cunning
crept
into
his
eyes
nothing
crooked
about
this
he
breathed
softly
i
had
the
key
to
this
side
of
his
character
you
remember
i
had
overheard
the
night
before
his
statement
of
his
moral
scruples
i
said
nothing
but
looked
knowing
what
was
it
he
murmured
plain
desertion
or
something
worse
i
remained
inscrutable
well
he
conceded
i
do
need
a
mate
and
a
naval
man
even
if
he
is
wantin
to
get
out
of
sight
he
wo
spit
on
your
decks
anyway
i
broke
in
boldly
captain
selover
hairy
face
bristled
about
the
mouth
this
i
subsequently
discovered
was
symptom
of
a
grin
you
saw
that
eh
he
trebled
are
you
afraid
he
bring
down
the
police
and
delay
your
sailing
i
asked
he
grinned
again
with
a
cunning
twinkle
in
his
eye
you
need
worry
there
ai
goin
to
be
any
police
he
had
his
advance
money
and
he
wo
risk
it
by
tryin
to
come
back
we
came
to
an
agreement
i
professed
surprise
at
the
wages
the
captain
guardedly
explained
that
the
expedition
was
secret
what
our
port
i
asked
to
test
him
our
papers
are
made
out
for
honolulu
he
replied
we
adjourned
to
sign
articles
by
the
way
said
i
i
wish
you
would
make
them
out
in
my
own
name
will
do
all
right
he
laughed
i
eagen
it
is
i
be
aboard
at
six
said
i
i
got
to
make
some
arrangements
wish
you
could
help
with
the
lading
said
he
still
i
can
get
along
want
any
advance
money
no
i
replied
then
i
remembered
that
i
was
supposed
to
be
broke
yes
i
amended
he
gave
me
ten
dollars
i
guess
you
show
up
he
said
would
do
this
to
everybody
but
a
naval
man
even
if
he
is
dodgin
uncle
sam
i
be
here
i
assured
him
at
that
time
i
wore
a
pointed
beard
this
i
shaved
also
i
was
accustomed
to
use
the
trouble
was
merely
a
slight
astigmatism
which
bothered
me
only
in
reading
or
close
inspection
i
could
get
along
perfectly
well
without
the
glasses
so
i
discarded
them
i
had
my
hair
cut
rather
close
when
i
had
put
on
sea
boots
blue
trousers
and
shirt
a
pea
jacket
and
a
cap
i
felt
quite
safe
from
the
recognition
of
a
man
like
schermerhorn
in
fact
as
you
shall
see
i
hardly
spoke
to
him
during
all
the
voyage
out
promptly
at
six
then
i
returned
with
a
sea
chest
bound
i
knew
not
whither
to
be
gone
i
knew
not
for
how
long
and
pledged
to
act
as
second
officer
on
a
little
schooner
ii
the
graven
image
i
had
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
my
disguise
if
such
it
could
be
called
captain
selover
at
first
failed
to
recognise
me
then
he
burst
into
his
shrill
cackle
did
know
you
he
trebled
but
you
look
shipshape
come
i
show
you
your
quarters
immediately
i
discovered
what
i
had
suspected
before
that
on
so
small
a
schooner
the
mate
took
rank
with
the
men
rather
than
the
afterguard
cabin
accommodations
were
of
course
very
limited
my
own
lurked
in
the
waist
of
the
ship
a
tiny
little
airless
hole
here
where
johnson
stayed
proffered
selover
you
can
bunk
here
or
you
can
go
in
the
with
the
men
they
more
room
there
we
get
under
way
with
the
turn
of
the
tide
he
left
me
i
examined
the
cabin
it
was
just
a
trifle
larger
than
its
single
berth
and
the
berth
was
just
a
trifle
larger
than
myself
my
chest
would
have
to
be
left
outside
i
strongly
suspected
that
my
lungs
would
have
to
be
left
outside
also
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
see
where
the
air
was
to
come
from
with
a
mental
reservation
in
favour
of
investigating
the
forecastle
i
went
on
deck
the
was
one
of
the
prettiest
little
schooners
i
ever
saw
were
it
not
for
the
lines
of
her
bilges
and
the
internal
arrangement
of
her
hold
it
might
be
imagined
she
had
been
built
originally
as
a
pleasure
yacht
even
the
rake
of
her
masts
a
little
forward
of
the
plumb
bore
out
this
impression
which
a
comparatively
new
suit
of
canvas
well
stopped
down
brass
stanchions
forward
and
two
little
guns
under
tarpaulins
almost
confirmed
one
thing
struck
me
as
peculiar
her
complement
of
boats
was
ample
enough
she
had
two
surf
boats
a
dingy
and
a
dory
slung
to
the
davits
in
addition
another
dory
the
one
you
picked
me
up
in
was
lashed
to
the
top
of
the
deck
house
they
mighty
near
have
a
boat
apiece
i
thought
and
went
forward
just
outside
the
forecastle
hatch
i
paused
someone
below
was
singing
in
a
voice
singularly
rich
in
quality
the
words
and
the
quaintness
of
the
minor
air
struck
me
immensely
and
have
clung
to
my
memory
like
a
burr
ever
since
you
a
or
a
privateer
said
he
high
blow
low
what
care
we
i
am
a
jolly
pirate
and
i
sailing
for
my
fee
on
the
coast
of
the
high
i
stepped
to
the
companion
the
voice
at
once
ceased
i
descended
a
glimmer
of
late
afternoon
struggled
through
the
deadlights
i
found
myself
in
a
really
commodious
space
extending
far
back
of
where
the
forward
are
usually
placed
accommodating
rows
and
row
of
bunks
eighteen
of
them
in
fact
the
unlighted
lamp
cast
its
shadow
on
wood
stained
black
by
much
use
but
polished
like
ebony
from
the
continued
friction
of
men
garments
i
wish
i
could
convey
to
you
the
uncanny
effect
this
of
dropping
from
the
decks
of
a
miniature
craft
to
the
internal
arrangements
of
a
ship
it
was
as
though
entering
a
cottage
door
you
were
to
discover
yourself
on
the
floor
of
madison
square
garden
a
fresh
sweet
breeze
of
evening
sucked
down
the
hatch
i
immediately
decided
on
the
forecastle
already
it
was
being
borne
in
on
me
that
i
was
little
more
than
a
glorified
mate
the
situation
suited
me
however
it
enabled
me
to
watch
the
course
of
events
more
safely
less
exposed
to
the
danger
of
recognition
i
stood
for
a
moment
at
the
foot
of
the
companion
accustoming
my
eyes
to
the
gloom
after
a
moment
with
a
shock
of
surprise
i
made
out
a
shining
pair
of
gazing
at
me
unblinkingly
from
the
shadow
under
the
bitts
slowly
the
man
defined
himself
as
a
shape
takes
form
in
a
fog
he
was
leaning
forward
in
an
attitude
of
attention
his
elbows
resting
on
his
knees
his
forearms
depending
between
them
his
head
thrust
out
i
could
detect
no
faintest
movement
of
eyelash
no
faintest
sound
of
breathing
the
stillness
was
portentous
the
creature
was
exactly
like
a
wax
figure
one
of
the
sort
you
meet
in
corridors
of
cheap
museums
and
for
a
moment
mistake
for
living
beings
almost
i
thought
to
make
out
the
customary
grey
dust
lying
on
the
wax
of
his
features
i
am
going
to
tell
you
more
of
this
man
because
as
you
shall
see
he
was
destined
to
have
much
to
do
with
my
life
the
fate
of
karl
augustus
schermerhorn
and
the
doom
of
the
he
wore
on
his
head
a
red
bandana
handkerchief
i
never
saw
him
with
other
covering
from
beneath
it
straggled
oily
and
tangled
locks
of
glossy
black
his
face
was
long
narrow
and
sinister
his
eyes
as
i
have
described
them
a
steady
and
beady
black
i
could
at
first
glance
ascribe
great
activity
but
only
moderate
strength
to
his
slender
wiry
figure
in
this
i
was
mistaken
his
sheer
physical
power
was
second
only
to
that
of
captain
selover
one
of
his
forearms
ended
in
a
steel
hook
at
the
moment
i
could
not
understand
this
could
not
see
how
a
man
so
maimed
could
be
useful
aboard
a
ship
later
i
wished
we
had
more
as
handy
he
knew
a
jam
hitch
which
he
caught
over
and
under
his
hook
quicker
than
most
men
can
grasp
a
line
with
the
naked
hand
it
would
render
one
way
but
held
fast
the
other
he
told
me
it
was
a
hitch
employed
by
mule
packers
in
the
mountains
and
that
he
had
used
it
on
in
the
lumber
woods
of
michigan
i
should
wonder
he
was
a
wandering
his
name
was
anderson
but
i
never
heard
him
called
that
it
was
always
handy
solomon
with
men
and
masters
we
stared
at
each
other
i
fascinated
by
something
some
spell
of
the
ship
which
i
have
never
been
able
to
explain
to
myself
nor
even
describe
it
was
a
mystery
a
portent
a
premonition
such
as
overtakes
a
man
sometimes
in
the
dark
passageways
of
life
i
can
not
tell
you
of
it
nor
make
you
believe
let
it
pass
then
by
a
slow
process
of
successive
perceptions
i
became
aware
that
i
was
watched
by
other
eyes
other
wax
figures
other
human
beings
with
unwavering
gaze
they
seemed
to
the
sense
of
mystic
apprehension
that
for
the
moment
held
possession
of
me
to
be
everywhere
in
the
bunks
on
the
floor
back
in
the
shadows
watching
watching
watching
from
the
advantage
of
another
world
illustration
slowly
the
man
defined
himself
as
a
shape
takes
form
in
a
fog
i
do
know
why
i
tell
you
this
why
i
lay
so
much
stress
on
the
first
weird
impression
i
got
of
the
forecastle
it
means
something
to
me
now
in
view
of
all
that
happened
subsequently
almost
can
i
look
back
and
see
in
that
moment
of
occultism
a
warning
an
enlightenment
but
the
point
is
it
meant
something
to
me
then
i
stood
there
fascinated
unable
to
move
unable
to
speak
then
the
grotesque
figure
in
the
corner
stirred
well
mates
said
the
man
believe
or
not
believe
it
in
the
book
and
it
stands
to
reason
too
we
have
gold
mines
here
in
californy
and
nevada
and
all
them
states
and
we
hear
of
gold
mines
in
mexico
and
australia
too
but
did
you
ever
hear
tell
of
gold
mines
in
europe
tell
me
that
and
where
did
the
gold
come
from
then
before
they
discovered
america
tell
me
that
why
they
made
it
just
as
the
man
that
wrote
says
and
you
can
kiss
the
book
on
that
how
about
that
place
ophir
i
read
about
asked
a
voice
from
the
bunks
the
man
shot
a
keen
glance
thither
from
beneath
his
brows
know
last
year
output
from
the
mines
of
ophir
thrackles
he
inquired
in
silky
tones
why
no
stammered
the
man
addressed
as
thrackles
well
i
do
pursued
the
man
with
the
steel
hook
and
it
just
the
whole
of
nothing
and
you
can
kiss
the
book
on
that
too
there
ai
any
gold
output
because
there
ai
any
mines
and
there
never
have
been
they
made
their
gold
he
tossed
aside
a
book
he
had
been
holding
in
his
left
hand
i
recognised
the
fat
little
paper
duodecimo
with
amusement
and
some
wonder
the
only
other
copy
i
had
ever
laid
my
eyes
on
is
in
the
astor
library
it
is
somewhat
of
a
rarity
called
secret
of
alchemy
or
the
grand
doctrine
of
transmutation
fully
and
was
written
by
a
edward
duvall
a
most
extraordinary
volume
to
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
seamen
i
stepped
forward
greeting
and
being
greeted
besides
the
man
i
have
mentioned
they
were
four
the
cook
was
a
squat
negro
with
a
broken
nose
i
believe
he
had
a
name
robinson
or
something
of
that
sort
he
was
to
all
of
us
simply
the
nigger
unlike
most
of
his
race
he
was
gloomy
and
taciturn
of
the
other
two
a
little
youth
named
pulz
and
a
mexican
called
perdosa
i
shall
have
more
to
say
later
my
arrival
broke
the
talk
on
alchemy
it
resumed
its
course
in
the
direction
of
our
voyage
each
discovered
that
the
others
knew
nothing
and
each
blundered
against
the
astounding
fact
of
double
wages
all
i
know
is
the
pay
good
and
that
enough
concluded
thrackles
from
a
bunk
the
pay
too
good
growled
handy
solomon
this
ai
no
job
to
go
look
at
the
of
the
moon
or
the
a
preacher
you
maik
heem
den
queried
perdosa
it
treasure
of
course
said
handy
solomon
shortly
he
he
he
laughed
the
negro
without
mirth
what
the
matter
with
you
doctor
demanded
thrackles
treasure
repeated
the
nigger
you
see
dat
box
he
done
carry
so
cairful
you
see
dat
a
pause
ensued
somebody
scratched
a
match
and
lit
a
pipe
no
i
do
see
that
broke
out
thrackles
finally
with
some
impatience
i
how
a
man
goes
after
treasure
with
a
box
but
why
should
he
take
treasure
away
in
a
box
what
do
you
think
bucko
he
suddenly
appealed
to
me
i
looked
up
from
my
investigation
of
the
empty
berths
i
do
think
much
about
it
i
replied
except
that
by
the
look
of
the
stores
we
due
for
more
than
honolulu
and
from
the
look
of
the
light
we
better
turn
to
on
deck
an
embarrassed
pause
fell
who
are
you
anyway
bluntly
demanded
the
man
with
the
steel
hook
my
name
is
eagen
i
replied
i
the
berth
of
mate
which
of
these
bunks
are
empty
they
indicated
what
i
desired
with
just
a
trace
of
sullenness
i
understood
well
enough
their
resentment
at
having
a
ship
officer
quartered
on
them
the
they
considered
as
their
only
liberty
when
at
sea
and
my
presence
as
a
curtailment
to
the
freedom
of
speech
i
subsequently
did
my
best
to
overcome
this
feeling
but
never
quite
succeeded
at
my
command
the
nigger
went
to
his
galley
i
ascended
to
the
deck
dusk
was
falling
in
the
swift
californian
fashion
already
the
outlines
of
the
wharf
houses
were
growing
indistinct
and
the
lights
of
the
city
were
beginning
to
twinkle
captain
selover
came
to
my
side
and
leaned
over
the
rail
peering
critically
at
the
black
water
against
the
piles
she
at
the
flood
he
squeaked
and
here
comes
the
lucy
belle
the
tug
took
us
in
charge
and
puffed
with
us
down
the
harbour
and
through
the
golden
gate
we
had
sweated
the
canvas
on
her
even
to
the
flying
jib
and
a
huge
club
topsail
she
sometimes
carried
at
the
main
for
the
afternoon
trades
had
lost
their
strength
about
midnight
we
drew
up
on
the
farallones
the
schooner
handled
well
our
crew
was
divided
into
three
watches
an
unusual
arrangement
but
comfortable
two
men
could
sail
her
handily
in
most
sorts
of
weather
handy
solomon
had
the
wheel
otherwise
the
deck
was
empty
the
man
fantastic
headgear
the
fringe
of
his
curling
oily
locks
the
hawk
outline
of
his
face
momentarily
silhouetted
against
the
phosphorescence
astern
as
he
glanced
to
windward
all
lent
him
an
appearance
of
another
day
i
could
almost
imagine
i
caught
the
gleam
of
horse
pistols
and
cutlasses
at
his
waist
i
brooded
in
wonder
at
what
i
had
seen
and
how
little
i
had
explained
the
number
of
boats
sufficient
for
a
craft
of
three
times
the
tonnage
the
capacity
of
the
with
its
eighteen
bunks
enough
for
a
passenger
ship
what
did
it
mean
and
this
wild
unkempt
villainous
crew
with
its
master
and
his
almost
ridiculous
contrast
of
neatness
and
filth
did
schermerhorn
realise
to
what
he
had
trusted
himself
and
his
precious
expedition
whatever
it
might
be
the
lights
of
shore
had
sunk
the
staggered
and
leaped
joyously
with
the
glory
of
the
open
sea
she
seemed
alone
on
the
bosom
of
the
ocean
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
but
feel
that
i
was
embarked
on
some
desperate
adventure
the
notion
was
utterly
illogical
that
i
knew
well
in
sober
thought
i
a
reporter
was
shadowing
a
respectable
and
venerable
scientist
who
in
turn
was
probably
about
to
investigate
at
length
some
conditions
or
phenomena
of
an
unexplored
island
but
that
did
not
suffice
to
my
imagination
the
ship
its
surroundings
its
equipment
its
crew
all
read
fantastic
so
much
the
better
story
i
thought
shrugging
my
shoulders
at
last
iii
the
twelve
repeating
rifles
after
my
watch
below
the
next
morning
i
met
percy
darrow
in
many
ways
he
is
or
was
the
most
extraordinary
of
my
many
acquaintances
during
that
first
half
hour
chat
with
him
i
changed
my
mind
at
least
a
dozen
times
one
moment
i
thought
him
clever
the
next
an
utter
ass
now
i
found
him
frank
open
a
good
companion
eager
to
please
and
then
a
droop
of
his
blond
eyelashes
a
lazy
impertinent
drawl
of
his
voice
a
hint
of
condescension
in
his
manner
convinced
me
that
he
was
shy
and
affected
in
a
breath
i
appraised
him
as
intellectual
a
fool
a
shallow
mind
a
deep
schemer
an
idler
and
an
enthusiast
one
result
of
his
spasmodic
confidences
was
to
throw
a
doubt
upon
their
accuracy
this
might
be
what
he
desired
or
with
equal
probability
it
might
be
the
chance
reflection
of
a
childish
and
aimless
amiability
he
was
tall
and
slender
and
pale
languid
of
movement
languid
of
eye
languid
of
speech
his
eyes
drooped
beneath
blond
brows
a
long
wiry
hand
lazily
twisted
a
rather
affected
blond
moustache
his
voice
drawled
his
speech
in
a
manner
either
insufferably
condescending
and
impertinent
or
ineffably
tired
who
could
tell
which
i
found
him
leaning
against
the
taffrail
his
languid
graceful
figure
supported
by
his
elbows
his
chin
propped
against
his
hand
as
i
approached
the
binnacle
he
raised
his
eyes
and
motioned
me
to
him
the
insolence
of
it
was
so
superb
that
for
a
moment
i
was
angry
enough
to
ignore
him
then
i
reflected
that
i
was
here
not
to
stand
on
my
personal
dignity
but
to
get
information
i
joined
him
you
are
the
mate
he
drawled
since
i
am
on
the
i
snapped
back
at
him
he
eyed
me
thoughtfully
while
he
rolled
with
one
hand
a
mexican
cigarette
do
you
know
where
you
are
going
he
inquired
at
length
depends
on
the
moral
character
of
my
future
actions
i
rejoined
tartly
he
allowed
a
smile
to
break
and
fade
then
lighted
his
cigarette
the
first
mate
seems
to
have
a
remarkable
command
of
language
said
he
i
did
not
reply
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
know
where
we
are
going
he
continued
thought
you
might
be
able
to
inform
me
where
did
this
ship
and
its
precious
gang
of
cutthroats
come
from
anyway
meaning
me
oh
meaning
you
too
for
all
i
know
he
shrugged
wearily
suddenly
he
turned
to
me
and
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
with
one
of
those
sudden
bursts
of
confidence
i
came
later
to
recognise
and
look
for
but
in
which
i
could
never
quite
believe
nor
disbelieve
i
am
eaten
with
curiosity
he
stated
in
the
least
curious
voice
in
the
world
i
suppose
you
know
who
his
nibs
is
schermerhorn
do
you
mean
yes
well
i
been
with
him
ten
years
i
am
his
man
all
his
business
i
transact
down
to
the
last
penny
i
even
order
his
meals
his
discoveries
have
taken
shape
in
my
hands
suddenly
he
gets
a
freak
he
will
go
on
a
voyage
where
i
shall
know
in
good
time
for
how
long
i
shall
know
in
good
time
for
what
purpose
same
answer
what
accommodations
shall
i
engage
i
experience
the
worst
shock
of
my
life
he
will
engage
them
himself
what
scientific
apparatus
shock
number
two
he
will
attend
to
that
is
there
anything
i
can
do
what
do
you
suppose
he
says
how
should
i
know
i
asked
you
should
know
in
the
course
of
intelligent
conversation
with
me
he
drawled
well
he
good
old
staid
schermie
with
the
vertebrated
thoughts
gets
kittenish
he
says
to
me
imachin
percy
you
are
placed
and
that
you
will
sit
on
those
sands
and
wish
within
yourself
all
you
would
buy
to
be
comfortable
go
out
and
buy
me
those
things
in
abundance
those
were
my
directions
he
puffed
what
does
he
pay
you
he
asked
enough
i
replied
more
than
enough
by
a
good
deal
i
bet
he
rejoined
the
old
fool
he
ought
to
have
left
it
to
me
what
is
this
craft
have
you
ever
sailed
on
her
before
no
have
any
of
the
crew
i
replied
that
i
believed
all
of
them
were
selover
men
he
threw
the
cigarette
butt
into
the
sea
and
turned
back
well
i
wish
you
joy
of
your
double
wages
he
mocked
so
he
knew
that
after
all
how
much
more
of
his
ignorance
was
pretended
i
had
no
means
of
guessing
his
eye
gleamed
sarcastically
as
he
sauntered
toward
the
handy
solomon
was
at
the
wheel
steering
easily
with
one
foot
and
an
elbow
his
steel
hook
lay
fully
exposed
glittering
in
the
sunlight
darrow
glanced
at
it
curiously
and
at
the
headgear
well
my
genial
pirate
he
drawled
if
you
had
a
line
to
fit
that
hook
you
be
equipped
for
fishing
the
man
teeth
bared
like
an
animal
but
darrow
went
on
easily
as
though
unconscious
of
giving
offence
if
i
were
you
i
have
it
arranged
so
the
hook
would
turn
backward
as
well
as
forward
it
would
be
handier
for
some
things
fighting
for
instance
he
passed
on
down
the
companion
handy
solomon
glared
after
him
then
down
at
his
hook
he
bent
his
arm
this
way
and
that
drawing
the
hook
toward
him
softly
as
a
cat
does
her
claws
his
eyes
cleared
and
a
look
of
admiration
crept
into
them
by
god
he
right
he
muttered
and
after
a
moment
i
wore
that
ten
year
and
never
thought
of
it
the
little
son
of
a
gun
he
remained
staring
for
a
moment
at
the
hook
then
he
looked
up
and
caught
my
eye
his
own
turned
quizzical
he
shifted
his
quid
and
began
to
hum
the
laid
aloft
aloft
laid
he
high
blow
low
what
care
we
a
ship
upon
the
a
wreck
upon
the
lee
on
the
coast
of
the
high
we
had
entered
the
trades
and
were
making
good
time
i
was
content
to
stay
on
deck
even
in
my
watch
below
the
wind
was
strong
the
waves
dashing
the
sky
very
blue
from
under
our
forefoot
the
flying
fish
sped
the
monsters
pursued
them
a
tingle
of
spray
was
in
the
air
it
was
all
very
pleasant
the
red
handkerchief
around
solomon
head
made
a
pretty
spot
of
colour
against
the
blue
of
the
sky
and
the
darker
blue
of
the
sea
silhouetted
over
the
white
of
the
deck
house
was
the
sullen
polished
profile
of
the
nigger
beneath
me
the
ship
swerved
and
leaped
yielded
and
recovered
i
breathed
deep
and
saw
cutlasses
in
harmless
shadows
it
was
two
years
ago
i
was
young
then
at
the
mess
hour
i
stood
in
doubt
however
i
was
informed
by
the
captain
falsetto
that
i
was
to
eat
in
the
cabin
as
the
only
other
officer
i
ate
alone
after
the
others
had
finished
helping
myself
from
the
dishes
left
on
the
table
it
was
a
handsome
cabin
well
kept
with
white
woodwork
spotlessly
clean
leather
cushions
much
better
than
one
would
expect
i
afterwards
found
that
the
neatness
of
this
cabin
and
of
the
three
staterooms
was
maintained
by
the
nigger
at
peril
of
his
neck
a
rack
held
a
dozen
rifles
five
revolvers
and
at
last
my
cutlasses
i
examined
the
lot
with
interest
they
were
modern
weapons
the
new
high
power
rifle
shooting
government
ammunition
and
had
been
used
the
revolvers
were
of
course
the
old
colt
this
was
an
extraordinary
armament
for
a
peaceable
schooner
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
tons
burden
the
rest
of
the
cabin
fittings
were
not
remarkable
by
the
configuration
of
the
ship
i
guessed
that
two
of
the
staterooms
must
be
rather
large
i
could
make
out
voices
within
on
deck
i
talked
with
captain
selover
she
a
snug
craft
i
approached
him
he
nodded
you
have
armed
her
well
he
muttered
something
of
pirates
and
the
china
seas
i
laughed
you
have
arms
enough
to
give
your
crew
about
two
magazine
rifles
apiece
unless
you
filled
all
your
berths
forward
captain
selover
looked
me
direct
in
the
eye
talk
straight
eagen
said
he
what
is
this
ship
and
where
is
she
bound
i
asked
with
equal
simplicity
he
considered
as
for
the
ship
he
replied
at
length
i
do
mind
saying
you
my
first
officer
and
on
you
i
depend
if
it
comes
to
well
the
small
arms
below
if
the
ship
a
little
under
the
shade
why
so
are
you
she
by
way
of
being
called
a
manner
of
hard
names
by
some
people
i
do
not
see
it
myself
it
is
a
matter
of
conscience
if
you
would
ask
some
interested
they
would
call
her
a
smuggler
a
thief
a
wrecker
and
all
the
other
evil
titles
in
the
catalogue
she
has
taken
in
chinks
by
way
of
santa
cruz
island
if
that
is
smuggling
the
country
is
free
and
a
chink
is
a
man
besides
it
paid
ten
dollars
a
head
for
the
landing
she
has
carried
in
a
cargo
or
so
of
junk
it
was
lying
on
the
beach
where
a
fool
master
had
piled
it
and
i
took
what
i
found
i
could
keep
track
of
the
underwriters
intentions
but
the
room
forward
i
broke
in
well
you
see
last
season
we
were
pearl
fishing
but
you
needed
only
your
diver
and
your
crew
i
objected
there
was
the
matter
of
a
japanese
gunboat
or
so
he
explained
poaching
i
cried
so
some
call
it
the
shells
are
there
the
islands
are
not
inhabited
i
do
not
see
how
men
claim
property
beyond
the
tide
water
i
have
heard
it
argued
hold
on
i
cried
there
was
a
trouble
last
year
in
the
ishigaki
jima
islands
where
a
poacher
beat
off
the
it
was
a
desperate
fight
captain
selover
eye
lit
up
i
commanded
a
black
brigantine
name
of
he
admitted
simply
she
was
a
brigantine
aloft
but
she
had
much
the
same
lines
as
the
he
whirled
on
his
heel
to
roll
to
one
of
the
covered
yacht
cannon
looks
like
a
harmless
little
toy
to
burn
black
powder
do
she
he
remarked
he
stripped
off
the
tarpaulin
and
the
false
brass
muzzle
to
display
as
pretty
a
little
maxim
as
you
would
care
to
see
now
you
know
all
about
it
he
said
look
here
captain
selover
i
demanded
do
you
know
that
i
could
blow
your
whole
higher
than
gilderoy
kite
how
do
you
know
i
wo
do
it
when
i
get
back
how
do
you
know
i
wo
inform
the
doctor
at
once
what
kind
of
an
outfit
he
has
tied
to
he
planted
far
apart
his
thick
legs
in
their
soiled
blue
trousers
pushed
back
his
greasy
linen
boating
hat
and
stared
at
me
with
some
amusement
how
do
you
know
i
wo
blow
on
lieutenant
or
ensign
ralph
slade
when
i
get
back
he
demanded
i
blessed
that
illusion
anyway
besides
i
know
my
man
you
wo
do
anything
of
the
sort
he
walked
to
the
rail
and
spat
carefully
over
the
side
as
for
the
doctor
he
went
on
he
knows
all
about
it
he
told
me
all
about
myself
and
everything
i
had
ever
done
from
the
time
i
licked
buck
jones
until
last
season
little
diversion
then
he
told
me
that
was
why
he
wanted
me
to
ship
for
this
cruise
the
captain
eyed
me
quizzically
i
threw
out
my
hands
in
a
comic
gesture
of
surrender
well
where
are
we
bound
anyway
the
dirty
unkempt
dishevelled
figure
stiffened
eagen
its
falsetto
shrilled
you
are
mate
of
this
vessel
your
duty
is
to
see
that
my
orders
as
to
sailing
are
carried
out
beyond
that
you
do
not
go
as
to
navigation
and
latitude
and
longitude
and
where
the
hell
we
are
that
is
outside
your
line
of
duty
as
to
where
we
are
bound
you
are
getting
double
wages
not
to
get
too
damn
curious
remember
to
earn
your
wages
mr
eagen
he
turned
away
to
the
binnacle
in
spite
of
his
personal
filth
in
spite
of
the
lawless
almost
piratical
character
of
the
man
in
that
moment
i
could
not
but
admire
him
if
percy
darrow
was
ignorant
of
the
purposes
of
this
expedition
how
much
more
so
captain
selover
yet
he
accepted
his
trust
blindly
and
as
far
as
i
could
then
see
intended
to
fulfil
it
faithfully
i
liked
him
none
the
worse
for
snubbing
me
it
indicated
a
streak
in
his
moral
nature
akin
to
and
quite
as
curious
as
his
excessive
neatness
regarding
his
immediate
surroundings
iv
the
steel
claw
during
the
next
few
days
the
crew
discussed
our
destination
discipline
while
maintained
strictly
was
not
conventional
during
the
dog
watches
often
every
man
aboard
would
be
below
for
at
that
period
captain
selover
loved
to
take
the
wheel
in
person
a
thick
cigar
between
his
lips
the
dingy
checked
shirt
wide
open
to
expose
his
hairy
chest
to
the
breeze
in
the
twilight
of
the
forecastle
we
had
some
great
talks
i
say
we
though
i
took
little
part
in
them
generally
i
lay
across
my
bunk
smoking
my
pipe
while
handy
solomon
held
forth
his
speech
punctuated
by
surly
speculations
from
the
nigger
with
hesitating
wisdom
from
the
hairy
thrackles
or
with
voluminous
bursts
of
fractured
english
from
perdosa
pulz
had
nothing
to
offer
but
watched
from
his
pale
green
eyes
the
light
shifted
and
wavered
from
one
to
the
other
as
the
ship
swayed
garments
swung
the
empty
berths
yawned
cavernous
i
could
imagine
the
forecastle
filled
with
the
desperate
men
who
had
beaten
off
the
the
story
is
told
that
they
had
swept
the
gunboat
decks
with
her
own
turned
in
no
one
knew
where
we
were
going
nor
why
the
doctor
puzzled
them
and
the
quantity
of
his
belongings
it
ai
pearls
said
handy
solomon
you
can
kiss
the
book
on
that
for
we
ai
a
diver
among
us
it
ai
chinks
for
we
are
cruising
likely
it
trade
trade
down
in
the
islands
we
were
all
below
the
captain
himself
had
the
wheel
discipline
while
strict
was
not
conventional
contrabandista
muttered
the
mexican
for
dat
he
geev
us
double
pay
we
do
get
her
for
nothing
agreed
thrackles
double
pay
and
duff
on
wednesday
generally
means
get
your
head
broke
no
trade
said
the
nigger
gloomily
they
turned
to
him
with
one
accord
why
not
demanded
pulz
breaking
his
silence
no
trade
repeated
the
nigger
ai
you
got
a
reason
doctor
asked
handy
solomon
no
trade
insisted
the
nigger
an
uneasy
silence
fell
i
could
not
but
observe
that
the
others
held
the
nigger
statements
in
a
respect
not
due
them
as
mere
opinions
subsequently
i
understood
a
little
more
of
the
reputation
he
possessed
he
was
believed
to
see
things
hidden
as
their
phrase
went
nobody
said
anything
for
some
time
nobody
stirred
except
that
handy
solomon
his
steel
claw
removed
from
its
socket
whittled
and
tested
screwed
and
turned
trying
to
fix
the
hook
so
that
in
accordance
with
the
advice
of
percy
darrow
it
would
turn
either
way
what
is
it
then
doctor
he
asked
softly
at
last
gold
said
the
nigger
shortly
gold
treasure
that
what
i
said
at
first
cried
handy
solomon
triumphantly
it
was
extraordinary
the
unquestioning
and
entire
faith
with
which
they
accepted
as
gospel
fact
the
negro
dictum
there
followed
much
talk
of
the
nature
of
this
treasure
whether
it
was
to
be
sought
or
conveyed
bought
stolen
or
ravished
in
fair
fight
no
further
soothsaying
could
they
elicit
from
the
nigger
they
followed
their
own
ideas
which
led
them
nowhere
someone
lit
the
forecastle
lamp
they
settled
themselves
pulz
read
aloud
this
was
the
programme
every
day
during
the
dog
watch
sometimes
the
watch
on
deck
was
absent
leaving
only
handy
solomon
the
nigger
and
pulz
but
the
order
of
the
day
was
not
on
that
account
varied
they
talked
they
lit
the
lamp
they
read
always
the
talk
was
of
the
treasure
as
to
the
reading
it
was
of
the
sort
usual
to
seamen
cowboys
lumbermen
and
miners
thrackles
had
a
number
of
volumes
of
very
cheap
love
stories
pulz
had
brought
some
extraordinary
garish
detective
stories
the
others
contributed
sensational
literature
with
paper
covers
adorned
lithographically
by
the
usual
incongruity
a
fragment
of
marble
was
included
in
the
collection
the
nigger
has
his
copy
of
on
i
have
the
slightest
idea
where
he
could
have
got
it
while
pulz
read
handy
solomon
worked
on
the
alteration
of
his
claw
he
could
never
get
it
to
hold
and
i
remember
as
an
undertone
to
reading
the
rumble
of
strange
exasperated
oaths
whatever
the
lecture
it
always
ended
with
the
book
on
alchemy
these
men
had
no
perspective
by
which
to
judge
such
things
they
accepted
its
speculations
and
theories
at
their
face
value
extremely
laughable
were
the
discussions
that
followed
i
often
wished
the
shade
of
old
duvall
could
be
permitted
to
see
these
his
last
disciples
spelling
out
dimly
his
teachings
mispronouncing
his
grave
utterances
but
believing
utterly
schermerhorn
appeared
on
deck
seldom
when
he
did
often
his
fingers
held
a
pen
which
he
had
forgotten
to
lay
aside
i
imagined
him
preoccupied
by
some
calculation
of
his
own
but
the
forecastle
more
picturesquely
saw
him
as
guarding
constantly
the
heavy
casket
he
had
himself
carried
aboard
he
breathed
the
air
walked
briskly
turned
with
the
german
military
precision
at
the
end
of
his
score
of
strides
and
his
cabin
at
the
lapse
of
the
half
hour
after
he
had
gone
remained
percy
darrow
leaning
indolently
against
the
taffrail
his
graceful
figure
swaying
with
the
ship
motion
smoking
always
the
mexican
cigarettes
which
he
rolled
with
one
hand
he
seemed
from
that
farthest
point
aft
to
hold
in
review
the
appliances
the
fabric
the
actions
yes
even
the
very
thoughts
of
the
entire
ship
from
them
he
selected
that
on
which
he
should
comment
or
with
which
he
should
play
always
with
a
sardonic
quite
wearied
and
indifferent
manner
his
inner
knowledge
viewed
by
the
light
of
this
manner
or
mannerism
was
sometimes
uncanny
though
perhaps
the
sources
of
his
information
were
commonplace
enough
after
all
certainly
he
always
viewed
with
amusement
his
victim
wonder
thus
one
evening
at
the
close
of
our
on
deck
he
approached
handy
solomon
it
was
at
the
end
of
ten
days
on
no
one
of
which
had
the
seaman
failed
to
tinker
away
at
his
steel
claw
darrow
balanced
in
front
of
him
with
a
thin
smile
too
bad
it
does
work
my
amiable
pirate
said
he
it
would
be
so
handy
for
fighting
see
here
he
suddenly
continued
pulling
some
object
from
his
pocket
here
a
pipe
present
to
me
i
do
smoke
twist
her
halfway
like
that
she
comes
out
twist
her
halfway
like
this
she
goes
in
that
your
principle
give
her
back
to
me
when
you
get
through
he
thrust
the
briar
pipe
into
the
man
hand
and
turned
away
without
waiting
for
a
reply
the
seaman
looked
after
him
in
open
amazement
that
evening
he
worked
on
the
socket
of
the
steel
hook
and
in
two
days
he
had
the
job
finished
then
he
returned
the
pipe
to
darrow
with
some
growling
of
thanks
that
all
right
said
the
young
man
smiling
full
at
him
now
what
are
you
going
to
fight
v
the
philosopher
stone
captain
selover
received
as
his
due
the
most
absolute
and
implicit
obedience
imaginable
when
he
condescended
to
give
an
order
in
his
own
person
the
men
fairly
jumped
to
execute
it
the
matter
had
evidently
been
threshed
out
long
ago
they
did
not
love
him
not
they
but
they
feared
him
with
a
mighty
fear
and
did
not
hesitate
to
say
so
vividly
and
often
when
in
the
privacy
of
the
forecastle
the
prevailing
spirit
was
that
of
the
wild
beast
cowed
but
snarling
still
pulz
and
thrackles
in
especial
had
a
great
deal
to
say
of
what
they
were
or
were
not
going
to
do
but
i
noticed
that
their
resolution
always
began
to
run
out
of
them
when
first
foot
was
set
to
the
companion
ladder
one
day
we
were
loafing
along
everything
drawing
well
and
everybody
but
the
doctor
on
deck
to
enjoy
the
sun
i
was
in
the
for
my
pleasure
below
me
on
the
deck
captain
selover
roamed
here
and
there
as
was
his
custom
his
eye
cocked
out
like
a
housewife
for
disorder
he
found
it
again
in
the
evidence
of
expectoration
and
as
perdosa
happened
to
be
handiest
fell
on
the
unfortunate
mexican
perdosa
protested
that
he
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
captain
selover
enraged
as
always
when
his
precious
deck
was
soiled
would
not
listen
finally
the
mexican
grew
sulky
and
turned
away
as
though
refusing
to
hear
more
the
captain
thereupon
felled
him
to
the
deck
and
began
brutally
to
kick
him
in
the
face
and
head
perdosa
writhed
and
begged
but
without
avail
the
other
members
of
the
crew
gathered
near
after
a
moment
they
began
to
murmur
finally
thrackles
ventured
most
respectfully
to
intervene
you
kill
him
sir
he
interposed
he
had
enough
had
enough
has
he
screeched
the
captain
well
you
take
left
he
marked
thrackles
heavily
over
the
eye
there
was
a
breathless
pause
and
then
thrackles
pulz
the
nigger
and
perdosa
attacked
at
once
they
caught
the
master
unawares
and
bore
him
to
the
deck
i
dropped
at
once
to
the
ratlines
and
commenced
my
descent
before
i
had
reached
the
deck
however
selover
was
afoot
again
the
four
hanging
to
him
like
dogs
in
a
moment
more
he
had
shaken
them
off
and
before
i
could
intervene
he
had
seized
a
belaying
pin
in
either
hand
and
was
hazing
them
up
and
down
the
deck
mutiny
would
you
he
shrilled
you
poor
swabs
forgot
who
was
your
captain
did
ye
well
it
captain
ezra
selover
and
you
can
lay
to
that
it
would
need
about
eight
fathom
of
like
you
to
tie
me
down
he
chased
them
forward
and
he
chased
them
aft
and
every
time
the
pins
fell
blood
followed
finally
they
dived
like
rabbits
into
the
forecastle
hatch
captain
selover
leaned
down
after
them
now
tie
yourselves
up
he
advised
and
then
come
on
deck
and
clean
up
after
yourselves
he
turned
to
me
eagen
turn
out
the
crew
to
clean
decks
i
descended
to
the
forecastle
followed
immediately
by
handy
solomon
the
latter
had
taken
no
part
in
the
affair
we
found
the
men
in
horrible
shape
what
with
the
bruises
and
cuts
and
bleeding
freely
now
you
a
sunday
school
observed
handy
soloman
eyeing
them
sardonically
tackel
old
scrubs
will
ye
well
some
needs
a
bale
of
cotton
to
fall
on
afore
they
learns
anything
enjoyed
your
little
diversions
mates
and
do
you
expect
to
gain
i
asks
you
that
now
you
poor
little
infants
ai
you
never
tackled
him
afore
do
remember
a
little
brigatine
name
of
the
my
eye
but
you
a
pack
of
damn
fools
to
this
he
received
no
reply
the
men
sullenly
assisted
each
other
then
they
went
immediately
on
deck
and
to
work
after
this
taste
of
his
quality
captain
selover
enjoyed
a
quiet
ship
we
made
good
time
but
for
a
long
while
nothing
happened
finally
the
monotony
was
broken
by
an
incident
one
evening
before
the
night
winds
i
sat
in
the
shadow
of
the
extra
dory
on
top
of
the
deck
house
the
moon
was
but
just
beyond
the
full
so
i
suppose
i
must
have
been
practically
invisible
certainly
the
nigger
did
not
know
of
my
presence
for
he
came
and
stood
within
three
feet
of
me
without
giving
any
sign
the
companion
was
open
in
a
moment
some
door
below
was
opened
also
and
a
scrap
of
conversation
came
up
to
us
very
clearly
you
haf
dem
finished
the
doctor
voice
inquired
so
that
iss
well
papers
rustled
for
a
few
moments
and
the
ah
exactly
it
iss
that
exactly
percy
mein
son
that
maigs
the
experiment
exact
we
haf
the
process
i
do
see
sir
quite
replied
the
voice
of
percy
darrow
with
a
tinge
of
excitement
i
can
follow
the
logic
of
the
experiment
of
course
so
can
i
follow
the
logic
of
a
trip
to
the
moon
but
when
you
come
to
apply
it
how
do
you
get
your
there
no
known
method
schermerhorn
broke
in
ach
it
iss
that
i
haf
perfected
pardon
me
my
boy
it
iss
the
first
i
haf
worked
from
you
apart
it
iss
for
a
surprise
i
haf
made
in
small
quantities
the
missing
ingredient
it
will
form
a
perfect
interruption
to
the
current
now
we
go
do
you
mean
to
say
almost
shouted
darrow
that
you
have
succeeded
in
freeing
it
in
the
metal
yes
replied
the
doctor
simply
i
could
hear
a
chair
overturned
why
with
that
you
can
i
can
do
everything
broke
in
the
doctor
the
possibilities
are
enormous
and
you
can
really
produce
it
in
quantity
i
think
so
it
iss
for
us
to
discover
a
pause
ensued
why
came
the
voice
of
percy
darrow
awestricken
with
fifty
centigrammes
only
you
could
you
could
transmute
any
substance
why
you
could
make
anything
you
pleased
almost
you
could
make
enough
diamonds
to
fill
that
chest
it
is
the
philosopher
stone
diamonds
yes
it
is
possible
interrupted
the
doctor
impatiently
if
it
was
worth
while
but
you
should
see
the
real
importance
the
ship
careened
to
a
chance
swell
a
door
slammed
the
voices
were
cut
off
i
looked
up
the
nigger
head
was
thrust
forward
fairly
into
the
glow
from
the
companionway
the
mask
of
his
sullenness
had
fallen
his
eyes
fairly
rolled
in
excitement
his
thick
lips
were
drawn
back
to
expose
his
teeth
his
powerful
figure
was
gathered
with
the
tensity
of
a
bow
when
the
door
slammed
he
turned
silently
to
glide
away
at
that
instant
the
watch
was
changed
and
in
a
moment
i
found
myself
in
my
bunk
ten
seconds
later
the
nigger
detained
by
captain
selover
for
some
trifling
duty
burst
into
the
forecastle
he
was
possessed
by
the
wildest
excitement
this
in
itself
was
enough
to
gain
the
attention
of
the
men
but
his
first
words
were
startling
i
found
de
treasure
he
almost
shouted
i
know
where
he
kept
they
leaped
at
him
handy
solomon
and
pulz
and
fairly
shook
out
of
him
what
he
thought
he
knew
he
babbled
in
the
forgotten
terms
of
alchemy
dressing
modern
facts
in
the
garments
of
mediaeval
thought
until
they
were
scarcely
to
be
recognised
and
so
he
say
dat
he
fine
him
de
philosopher
stone
and
he
keep
him
in
dat
heavy
box
we
see
him
carry
aboard
and
he
don
have
to
make
gol
with
it
he
can
make
diamon
he
say
it
too
easy
to
fill
dat
box
plum
full
of
diamon
they
gesticulated
and
exclaimed
and
breathed
hard
full
of
the
marvel
of
such
a
thought
then
abruptly
the
clamour
died
to
nothing
i
felt
six
eyes
bent
on
me
six
unwinking
eyes
moving
restless
in
motionless
figures
suspicious
deadly
as
cobras
up
to
now
my
standing
with
the
men
had
been
well
enough
now
they
drew
frankly
apart
one
of
the
most
significant
indications
of
this
was
the
increased
respect
they
paid
my
office
it
was
as
though
by
prompt
obedience
instant
deference
and
the
emphasising
of
ship
etiquette
they
intended
to
draw
sharply
the
line
between
themselves
and
me
there
was
much
whispering
apart
many
private
talks
and
consultations
in
which
i
had
no
part
ordinarily
they
talked
freely
enough
before
me
even
the
reading
during
the
dog
watch
was
intermitted
at
least
it
was
on
such
days
as
i
happened
to
be
in
the
watch
below
but
twice
i
caught
the
nigger
and
handy
solomon
consulting
together
over
the
volume
on
alchemy
i
was
in
two
minds
whether
to
report
the
whole
matter
to
captain
selover
the
only
thing
that
restrained
me
was
the
vagueness
of
the
intention
and
the
fact
that
the
afterguard
was
armed
and
was
four
to
the
crew
five
an
incident
however
decided
me
one
evening
i
was
awakened
by
a
sound
of
violent
voices
captain
selover
occasionally
juggled
the
watches
for
variety
sake
and
i
now
had
handy
solomon
and
perdosa
the
nigger
being
cook
stood
no
watch
you
drunken
greaser
swab
snarled
handy
solomon
you
misbegotten
son
of
a
yaqui
i
learn
you
to
step
on
a
seaman
foot
and
you
can
kiss
the
book
on
that
i
cut
your
heart
out
and
feed
it
to
the
sharks
potha
sneered
perdosa
you
cut
heem
you
finger
wid
your
knife
they
wrangled
at
first
i
thought
the
quarrel
genuine
but
after
a
moment
or
so
i
could
not
avoid
a
sort
of
reminiscent
impression
of
the
cheap
melodrama
it
seemed
incredible
but
soon
i
could
not
dodge
the
conclusion
that
it
was
a
quarrel
designed
to
impress
me
why
should
they
desire
to
do
so
i
had
to
give
it
up
but
the
fact
itself
was
obvious
enough
i
laughed
to
see
them
the
affair
did
not
come
to
blows
but
it
did
come
to
black
looks
on
meeting
muttered
oaths
growls
of
enmity
every
time
they
happened
to
pass
each
other
on
the
deck
perdosa
was
not
so
bad
his
mexican
blood
inclined
him
to
the
histrionic
and
his
mexican
cast
lent
itself
well
to
evil
looks
but
handy
solomon
for
the
first
time
in
my
acquaintance
with
him
was
ridiculous
about
this
time
we
crossed
into
frequent
thunders
one
evening
just
at
dark
we
made
out
a
heavy
black
squall
not
knowing
exactly
what
weight
lay
behind
it
i
called
up
all
hands
we
ducked
the
staysail
and
foresail
lowered
the
peak
of
the
mainsail
and
waited
to
feel
of
it
a
rough
and
ready
seamanship
often
used
in
these
little
california
windjammers
i
was
pretty
busy
but
i
heard
distinctly
handy
voice
behind
me
i
kill
you
sure
you
greaser
as
soon
as
my
hands
are
free
and
some
muttered
reply
from
the
mexican
the
wind
hit
us
hard
held
on
a
few
moments
and
moderated
to
a
stiff
puff
there
followed
the
rain
so
of
course
i
knew
it
would
amount
to
nothing
i
was
just
stooping
to
throw
the
stops
off
the
staysail
when
i
felt
myself
seized
from
behind
and
forced
rapidly
toward
the
side
of
the
ship
of
course
i
struggled
the
japanese
have
a
little
trick
to
fool
a
man
who
catches
you
around
the
waist
from
behind
it
is
part
of
the
taught
the
samurai
quite
a
different
proposition
from
the
ordinary
policeman
i
picked
it
up
from
a
friend
in
the
nobility
it
came
in
very
handy
now
and
by
good
luck
a
roll
of
the
ship
helped
me
in
a
moment
i
stood
free
and
perdosa
was
picking
himself
out
of
the
scuppers
the
expression
of
astonishment
was
fairly
well
done
i
will
say
that
for
him
but
i
was
prepared
for
histrionics
señor
he
gasped
eet
is
you
maria
i
thought
you
was
dat
solomon
pardon
me
señor
pardon
have
i
hurt
you
he
approached
me
almost
wheedling
i
could
have
laughed
at
the
villain
it
was
all
so
transparent
he
no
more
mistook
me
for
handy
solomon
than
he
felt
any
real
enmity
for
that
person
but
being
angry
and
perhaps
a
little
scared
i
beat
him
to
his
quarters
with
a
belaying
pin
on
thinking
the
matter
over
however
i
failed
to
see
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
it
i
could
understand
a
desire
to
get
rid
of
me
there
would
be
one
less
of
the
afterguard
and
then
too
i
knew
too
much
of
the
men
sentiments
if
not
of
their
plans
but
why
all
this
elaborate
farce
of
the
mock
quarrel
and
the
alleged
mistake
could
it
be
to
guard
against
possible
failure
i
could
hardly
think
it
worth
while
my
only
theory
was
that
they
had
wished
to
test
my
strength
and
determination
the
whole
affair
even
on
that
supposition
was
childish
enough
but
i
referred
the
exaggerated
cunning
to
handy
solomon
and
considered
it
quite
adequately
explained
it
is
a
minor
point
but
subsequently
i
learned
that
this
surmise
was
correct
i
was
to
be
saved
because
none
of
the
conspirators
understood
navigation
the
next
morning
i
approached
captain
selover
captain
said
i
i
think
it
my
duty
to
report
that
there
is
trouble
brewing
among
the
crew
there
always
is
he
replied
unmoved
but
this
is
serious
schermerhorn
came
aboard
with
a
chest
which
the
men
think
holds
treasure
the
other
evening
robinson
overheard
him
tell
his
assistant
that
he
could
easily
fill
the
box
with
diamonds
of
course
he
was
merely
illustrating
the
value
of
some
scientific
experiment
but
robinson
thinks
and
has
made
the
others
think
that
the
chest
contains
something
to
make
diamonds
with
i
am
sure
they
intend
to
get
hold
of
it
the
affair
is
coming
to
a
head
captain
selover
listened
almost
indifferently
i
came
back
from
the
islands
last
year
he
piped
with
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
worth
of
pearls
there
was
sixteen
in
the
crew
and
every
man
of
them
was
blood
hungry
for
them
pearls
they
had
three
or
four
shindies
and
killed
one
man
over
the
proper
way
to
divide
the
loot
after
they
had
got
it
they
did
get
it
why
he
drew
his
powerful
figure
to
its
height
and
spread
his
thick
arms
out
in
the
luxury
of
stretching
why
he
repeated
exhaling
abruptly
because
their
captain
was
ezra
selover
well
eagen
he
went
on
crisply
captain
ezra
selover
is
their
captain
they
know
they
talk
and
palaver
and
git
into
dark
corners
and
sharpen
their
knives
and
perhaps
fight
it
out
as
to
which
one
going
to
work
the
business
in
the
doctor
chest
and
which
one
going
to
tie
up
the
sacks
of
them
diamonds
but
they
wo
git
any
farther
as
long
as
captain
ezra
is
on
deck
yes
i
objected
but
they
mean
business
last
night
in
the
squall
one
of
them
tried
to
throw
me
overboard
captain
selover
grinned
what
did
you
do
he
asked
hazed
him
to
his
quarters
with
a
belaying
pin
well
that
all
settled
then
is
it
what
more
do
you
want
i
stood
undecided
i
can
take
care
of
myself
he
went
on
you
ought
to
take
care
of
yourself
then
there
nothing
more
to
do
he
mused
a
moment
you
have
a
gun
of
course
he
inquired
i
forgot
to
ask
no
said
i
he
whistled
well
no
wonder
you
feel
sort
of
lost
and
hopeless
here
take
this
it
make
a
man
of
you
he
gave
me
a
colt
the
barrel
of
which
had
been
filed
down
to
about
two
inches
of
length
it
was
a
most
extraordinary
weapon
but
effective
at
short
range
here
a
few
loose
cartridges
said
he
now
go
easy
this
is
no
warship
and
we
ai
got
men
to
experiment
on
lick
with
your
fists
or
a
pin
if
you
can
and
if
you
do
shoot
for
god
sake
just
wing
a
little
they
awful
good
lads
but
a
little
restless
i
took
the
gun
and
felt
better
with
it
i
could
easily
handle
the
members
of
my
own
watch
and
i
did
not
doubt
that
with
the
assistance
of
percy
darrow
even
a
surprise
would
hardly
overwhelm
us
i
did
not
count
on
schermerhorn
he
was
quite
capable
of
losing
himself
in
a
problem
of
trajectory
after
the
first
shot
vi
the
island
i
came
on
deck
one
morning
at
about
four
bells
to
find
the
entire
ship
company
afoot
even
the
doctor
was
there
everybody
was
gazing
eagerly
at
a
narrow
mountainous
island
lying
across
the
early
morning
we
were
as
yet
some
twenty
miles
distant
from
it
and
could
make
out
nothing
but
its
general
outline
the
latter
was
sharply
defined
rising
and
falling
to
a
highest
point
one
side
of
the
middle
over
the
island
and
raggedly
clasping
its
sides
hung
a
cloud
the
only
one
visible
in
the
sky
i
joined
the
afterguard
you
see
the
doctor
was
exclaiming
it
iss
as
i
haf
said
the
island
iss
there
everything
iss
as
it
should
be
he
was
quite
excited
percy
darrow
too
was
shaken
out
of
his
ordinary
calm
the
volcano
is
active
was
his
only
comment
but
it
explained
the
ragged
cloud
you
say
there
a
harbour
inquired
captain
selover
it
should
be
on
the
west
end
said
schermerhorn
captain
selover
drew
me
one
side
he
too
was
a
little
aroused
now
would
that
get
you
he
squeaked
doctor
runs
up
against
a
norwegian
bum
who
tells
him
about
a
volcanic
island
and
gives
its
bearings
the
island
ai
on
the
map
at
all
doctor
believes
it
and
makes
me
lay
my
course
for
those
bearings
here
the
so
the
bum
story
was
true
i
like
to
know
what
the
rest
of
it
was
his
eyes
were
shining
do
we
anchor
or
stand
off
and
on
i
asked
captain
selover
turned
to
grip
me
by
the
shoulder
i
have
orders
from
darrow
to
get
to
a
good
berth
to
land
to
build
shore
quarters
and
to
snug
down
for
a
stay
of
a
year
at
least
we
stared
at
each
other
joyous
prospect
i
muttered
hope
there
something
to
do
there
the
morning
wore
and
we
rapidly
approached
the
island
it
proved
to
be
utterly
precipitous
the
high
rounded
hills
sloped
easily
to
within
a
hundred
feet
or
so
of
the
water
and
then
fell
away
abruptly
where
the
earth
ended
was
a
fantastic
filigree
border
like
the
fancy
paper
with
which
our
mothers
used
to
line
the
pantry
shelves
below
the
white
surges
flung
themselves
against
the
cliffs
with
a
wild
abandon
thousands
of
sea
birds
wheeled
in
the
eddies
of
the
wind
thousands
of
ravens
perched
on
the
slopes
with
our
glasses
we
could
make
out
the
heads
of
seals
fishing
outside
the
surf
and
a
ragged
belt
of
kelp
when
within
a
mile
we
put
the
helm
up
and
ran
for
the
west
end
a
bold
point
we
avoided
far
out
lest
there
should
be
outlying
ledges
then
we
came
in
sight
of
a
broad
beach
and
pounding
surf
i
was
ordered
to
take
a
surf
boat
and
investigate
for
a
landing
and
an
anchorage
the
swell
was
running
high
we
rowed
back
and
forth
puzzled
as
to
how
to
get
ashore
with
all
the
freight
it
would
be
necessary
to
land
the
ship
would
lie
well
enough
for
the
only
open
exposure
was
broken
by
a
long
reef
over
which
we
could
make
out
the
seas
tumbling
but
inshore
the
great
waves
rolled
smoothly
swiftly
then
suddenly
fell
forward
as
over
a
ledge
and
spread
with
a
roar
across
the
yellow
sands
the
fresh
winds
blew
the
spume
back
to
us
we
conversed
in
shouts
we
can
surf
the
boat
yelled
thrackles
but
we
ca
land
a
load
that
was
my
opinion
we
rowed
slowly
along
parallel
to
the
shore
and
just
outside
the
line
of
breakers
i
do
know
exactly
how
to
tell
you
the
manner
in
which
we
became
aware
of
the
cove
it
was
as
nearly
the
instantaneous
as
can
be
imagined
one
minute
i
looked
ahead
on
a
cliff
as
unbroken
as
the
side
of
a
cabin
the
very
next
i
peered
down
the
length
of
a
cove
fifty
fathoms
long
by
about
ten
wide
at
the
end
of
which
was
a
gravel
beach
i
cried
out
sharply
to
the
men
they
were
quite
as
much
astonished
as
i
we
backed
water
watching
closely
at
a
given
point
the
cove
and
all
trace
of
its
entrance
disappeared
we
could
only
just
make
out
the
line
where
the
headlands
dissolved
into
the
background
of
the
cliffs
and
that
merely
because
we
knew
of
its
existence
the
blending
was
perfect
we
rowed
in
the
water
was
still
a
faint
ebb
and
flow
whispered
against
the
tiny
gravel
beach
at
the
end
i
noted
a
practicable
way
from
it
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
and
from
the
cliff
down
again
to
the
sand
beach
everything
was
perfect
the
water
was
a
beautiful
light
green
like
glass
and
from
the
indistinctness
of
its
depths
waved
and
beckoned
rose
and
disappeared
with
indescribable
grace
and
deliberation
long
feathery
sea
growths
in
a
moment
the
bottom
abruptly
shallowed
the
motion
of
the
boat
toward
the
beach
permitted
us
to
catch
a
hasty
glimpse
of
little
fish
darting
of
big
fish
turning
of
yellow
sand
and
some
vivid
colour
then
came
the
grate
of
gravel
and
the
scraping
of
the
boat
bottom
on
the
beach
we
jumped
ashore
eagerly
i
left
the
men
very
reluctant
and
ascended
a
natural
trail
to
a
high
sloping
down
over
which
blew
the
great
trades
grass
sprung
a
low
hill
rose
at
the
back
from
below
the
fall
of
the
cliff
came
the
pounding
of
surf
i
walked
to
the
edge
various
ledges
sloping
toward
me
ran
down
to
the
sea
against
one
of
them
was
a
wreck
not
so
very
old
head
on
her
afterworks
gone
i
recognised
the
name
and
was
vastly
astonished
to
find
her
here
against
this
unknown
island
far
up
the
coast
i
could
see
with
the
surges
dashing
up
like
the
explosion
of
shells
and
the
cliffs
and
the
rampart
of
hills
grown
with
grass
and
cactus
a
bold
promontory
terminated
the
coast
view
to
the
north
and
behind
it
i
could
glimpse
a
more
fertile
and
wooded
country
the
sky
was
partly
overcast
by
the
volcanic
murk
it
fled
before
the
trades
and
the
red
sun
alternately
blazed
and
clouded
through
it
as
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
seen
here
i
turned
above
the
hollow
of
our
cove
skirted
the
base
of
the
hill
and
so
down
to
the
beach
it
occupied
a
wide
semicircle
where
the
hills
drew
back
the
flat
was
dry
and
grown
with
thick
coarse
grass
a
stream
emerged
from
a
sort
of
canon
on
its
landward
side
i
tasted
it
found
it
sulphurous
and
a
trifle
worse
than
lukewarm
a
little
nearer
the
cliff
however
was
a
clear
cold
spring
from
the
rock
and
of
this
i
had
a
satisfying
drink
when
i
arose
from
my
knees
i
made
out
an
animal
on
the
hill
crest
looking
at
me
but
before
i
could
distinguish
its
characteristics
it
had
disappeared
i
returned
along
the
tide
sands
the
surf
dashed
and
roared
lifting
seaweeds
of
a
blood
red
so
that
in
places
the
water
looked
pink
seals
innumerable
watched
me
from
just
outside
the
breakers
as
the
waves
lifted
to
a
i
could
make
out
others
playing
darting
back
and
forth
up
and
down
like
disturbed
tadpoles
clinging
to
the
wave
until
the
very
instant
of
its
fall
then
disappearing
as
though
blotted
out
the
salt
smell
of
seaweed
was
in
my
nostrils
i
found
the
place
pleasant
with
these
few
and
scattered
impressions
we
returned
to
the
ship
it
had
been
warped
to
a
secure
anchorage
and
snugged
down
schermerhorn
and
darrow
were
on
deck
waiting
to
go
ashore
i
made
my
report
the
two
passengers
disappeared
they
carried
lunch
and
would
not
be
back
until
we
had
orders
to
pitch
a
large
tent
at
a
suitable
spot
and
to
lighten
ship
of
the
doctor
personal
and
scientific
effects
by
the
time
this
was
accomplished
the
two
had
returned
it
all
right
darrow
volunteered
to
captain
selover
as
he
came
over
the
side
we
found
what
we
want
their
clothes
were
picked
by
brush
and
their
boots
muddy
next
morning
captain
selover
detailed
me
to
especial
work
you
take
two
of
the
men
and
go
ashore
under
darrow
orders
said
he
darrow
told
us
to
take
clothes
for
a
week
an
axe
apiece
and
a
block
and
tackle
we
made
up
our
ditty
bags
stepped
into
one
of
the
surf
boats
and
were
rowed
ashore
there
darrow
at
once
took
the
lead
our
way
proceeded
across
the
grass
flat
through
the
opening
of
the
narrow
cañon
and
so
on
back
into
the
interior
by
way
of
the
bed
through
which
flowed
the
sulphur
stream
the
country
was
badly
eroded
most
of
the
time
we
marched
between
perpendicular
clay
banks
about
forty
feet
high
these
were
occasionally
broken
by
smaller
tributary
arroyos
of
the
same
sort
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
reach
the
level
of
the
upper
country
the
bed
of
the
main
arroyo
was
flat
and
grown
with
grasses
and
herbage
of
an
extraordinary
vividness
due
i
supposed
to
the
sulphur
water
the
stream
itself
meandered
aimlessly
through
the
broader
bed
it
steadily
grew
warmer
and
the
sulphur
smell
more
noticeable
above
us
we
could
see
the
sky
and
the
sharp
clay
edge
of
the
arroyo
i
noticed
the
tracks
of
darrow
and
schermerhorn
made
the
day
before
after
a
mile
of
this
the
bottom
ran
up
nearly
to
the
level
of
the
sides
and
we
stepped
out
on
the
floor
of
a
little
valley
almost
surrounded
by
more
hills
it
was
an
extraordinary
place
and
since
much
happened
there
i
must
give
you
an
idea
of
it
it
was
round
and
nearly
encircled
by
naked
painted
hills
from
its
floor
came
steam
and
a
roaring
sound
the
steam
blew
here
and
there
among
the
pines
on
the
floor
rose
to
eddy
about
the
naked
painted
hills
at
one
end
we
saw
intermittently
a
broad
ascending
cañon
deep
red
and
ending
in
the
cone
of
a
smoking
volcano
the
other
seemed
quite
closed
by
the
sheer
hills
in
fact
the
only
exit
was
the
route
by
which
we
had
come
for
the
hills
were
utterly
precipitous
i
suppose
a
man
might
have
made
his
way
up
the
various
knobs
ledges
and
inequalities
but
it
would
have
required
long
study
and
a
careful
head
i
myself
later
worked
my
way
a
short
distance
merely
to
examine
the
texture
of
their
marvellous
colour
this
was
at
once
varied
and
of
great
body
not
at
all
like
the
smooth
glossed
colour
of
most
rock
but
soft
and
rich
you
seen
palettes
it
was
just
like
that
pasty
and
there
were
reds
of
all
shades
from
a
veritable
scarlet
to
a
red
umber
greens
from
to
emerald
several
kinds
of
blue
and
an
indeterminate
the
whole
effect
was
splendid
and
barbaric
we
stopped
and
gasped
as
it
hit
our
eyes
darrow
alone
was
unmoved
he
led
the
way
forward
and
in
an
instant
had
disappeared
behind
the
veil
of
steam
thrackles
and
perdosa
hung
back
murmuring
but
at
a
sharp
word
from
me
gathered
their
courage
in
their
two
hands
and
proceeded
we
found
that
the
first
veil
of
steam
and
a
fearful
stench
of
gases
proceeded
from
a
miniature
crater
whose
edge
was
heavily
encrusted
with
a
white
salt
beyond
close
under
the
rise
of
the
hill
was
another
between
the
two
percy
darrow
had
stopped
and
was
waiting
he
eyed
us
with
his
lazy
glance
as
we
approached
think
the
place
is
going
to
blow
up
he
inquired
with
a
tinge
of
irony
well
it
is
he
turned
to
me
here
where
we
shall
stay
for
a
while
you
and
the
men
are
to
cut
a
number
of
these
pine
trees
for
a
house
better
pick
out
the
little
ones
about
three
or
four
inches
through
they
easier
handled
i
be
back
by
noon
we
set
to
work
then
in
the
roaring
steaming
valley
with
the
vapour
swirling
about
us
sometimes
concealing
us
sometimes
half
revealing
us
gigantic
again
in
the
utterness
of
exposure
showing
us
dwindled
pigmies
against
the
magnitudes
about
us
the
labour
was
not
difficult
by
the
time
darrow
returned
we
had
a
pile
of
the
saplings
ready
for
his
next
direction
he
was
accompanied
by
the
nigger
very
much
terrified
very
much
burdened
with
food
and
cooking
utensils
the
assistant
was
lazily
relating
tales
of
voodoos
a
glimmer
of
mischief
in
his
eyes
vii
captain
selover
loses
his
nerve
i
lived
in
the
place
for
three
weeks
we
were
afoot
shortly
after
daybreak
under
way
by
and
at
work
before
the
heats
began
three
of
us
worked
on
the
buildings
and
the
rest
formed
a
pack
train
carrying
all
sorts
of
things
from
the
shore
to
the
valley
the
men
grumbled
fiercely
at
this
but
captain
selover
drove
them
with
slight
regard
for
their
opinions
or
feelings
you
getting
double
pay
was
his
only
word
earn
it
they
certainly
earned
it
during
those
three
weeks
the
things
they
brought
up
were
astounding
besides
a
lot
of
scientific
apparatus
and
chests
of
chemical
supplies
everything
that
could
possibly
be
required
had
been
provided
by
that
omniscient
young
man
after
we
had
built
a
long
low
structure
windows
were
forthcoming
shelves
tables
sinks
faucets
forges
burners
all
cut
out
fitted
and
ready
to
put
together
each
with
its
proper
screws
nails
clamps
or
pipes
ready
to
our
hands
when
we
had
finished
we
had
constructed
as
complete
a
laboratory
on
a
small
scale
as
you
could
find
on
a
college
campus
even
to
the
stone
pillar
down
to
for
delicate
microscopic
experiments
and
hot
and
cold
water
led
from
the
springs
and
we
were
utterly
unskilled
it
was
all
percy
darrow
i
was
toward
the
last
engaged
in
screwing
on
a
fixture
for
the
generation
of
acetelyne
gas
darrow
said
i
there
one
thing
you
overlooked
you
forgot
to
bring
a
cupola
and
a
gilt
for
this
concern
after
the
laboratory
was
completed
we
put
up
sleeping
quarters
for
the
two
men
with
wide
porches
well
screened
and
a
square
heavy
storeroom
by
the
end
of
the
third
week
we
had
quite
finished
schermerhorn
had
turned
with
enthusiasm
to
the
unpacking
of
his
chemical
apparatus
almost
immediately
at
the
close
of
the
he
had
appeared
lugging
his
precious
chest
this
time
suffering
the
assistance
of
darrow
and
had
camped
on
the
spot
we
could
not
induce
him
to
leave
so
we
put
up
a
tent
for
him
darrow
remained
with
him
by
way
of
safety
against
the
men
whose
measure
i
believe
he
had
taken
now
that
all
the
work
was
finished
the
doctor
put
in
a
sudden
appearance
percy
said
he
now
we
will
have
the
defence
built
he
dragged
us
with
him
to
the
narrow
part
of
the
arroyo
just
before
it
rose
to
the
level
of
the
valley
here
we
will
build
the
he
announced
darrow
and
i
stared
at
each
other
blankly
what
for
sir
inquired
the
assistant
i
haf
come
to
be
undisturbed
announced
the
doctor
with
teutonic
gravity
and
i
will
not
be
disturbed
darrow
nodded
to
me
and
drew
his
principal
aside
they
conversed
earnestly
for
several
minutes
then
the
assistant
returned
to
me
no
use
he
shrugged
in
complete
return
to
his
indifferent
manner
stockade
it
is
better
make
it
of
fourteen
foot
logs
slanted
out
dig
a
trench
across
plant
your
logs
three
or
four
feet
bind
them
at
the
top
that
his
specification
for
it
go
at
it
but
i
expostulated
what
the
of
it
even
if
the
men
were
dangerous
that
would
just
make
them
think
you
have
something
to
guard
i
know
that
orders
replied
percy
darrow
we
built
the
stockade
in
a
day
when
it
was
finished
we
marched
to
the
beach
and
never
save
in
the
three
instances
of
which
i
shall
later
tell
you
did
i
see
the
valley
again
the
next
day
we
washed
our
clothes
and
moved
ashore
with
all
our
belongings
i
not
going
to
have
this
crew
aboard
stated
captain
selover
positively
i
going
to
clean
her
he
himself
stayed
however
we
rowed
in
constructed
a
hasty
fireplace
of
stones
spread
our
blankets
and
built
an
unnecessary
fire
near
the
beach
clean
her
grumbled
thrackles
my
eye
i
rather
round
the
cape
growled
pulz
hopelessly
come
now
it
ca
be
as
bad
as
all
that
i
tried
to
cheer
them
it
ca
be
more
than
a
week
or
ten
days
job
even
if
we
careen
her
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
said
thrackles
worse
than
the
yellow
jack
it
six
weeks
at
least
mind
when
we
last
her
he
inquired
of
handy
solomon
you
can
kiss
the
book
on
it
replied
he
down
by
the
line
in
that
little
swab
of
a
sand
island
my
eye
but
i
remember
i
sweated
my
liver
white
they
smoked
in
silence
that
a
main
queer
contrivance
of
the
perfessor
that
ventured
solomon
after
a
little
he
does
want
any
intrusion
i
said
these
scientific
experiments
are
very
delicate
quite
like
he
commented
we
slept
on
the
ground
that
night
and
next
morning
under
captain
selover
directions
we
commenced
the
task
of
lightening
the
ship
he
detailed
the
nigger
and
perdosa
for
special
duty
i
just
see
to
your
shore
quarters
he
squeaked
you
empty
her
all
day
long
we
rowed
back
and
forth
from
the
ship
to
the
cove
landing
the
contents
of
the
hold
these
by
good
fortune
we
did
not
have
to
carry
over
the
neck
of
land
for
just
above
the
gravel
beach
was
a
wide
ledge
on
which
we
could
pile
the
stores
we
ate
aboard
and
so
had
no
opportunity
of
seeing
what
captain
selover
and
his
men
were
about
until
evening
then
we
discovered
that
they
had
collected
and
lowered
to
the
beach
a
quantity
of
stateroom
doors
from
the
wreck
and
had
trundled
the
galley
stove
to
the
edge
where
it
awaited
our
assistance
we
hitched
a
cable
to
it
and
let
it
down
gently
the
nigger
was
immensely
pleased
after
some
experiment
he
got
it
to
draw
and
so
cooked
us
our
supper
on
it
after
supper
captain
selover
rowed
himself
back
to
the
ship
eagen
he
had
said
drawing
me
aside
i
going
to
leave
you
with
them
it
better
that
one
of
us
i
think
as
owner
i
ought
to
be
aboard
of
course
sir
said
i
it
the
only
proper
place
for
you
i
glad
you
think
so
he
rejoined
apparently
relieved
and
anyway
he
cried
with
a
burst
of
feeling
i
hate
the
gritty
feeling
of
it
under
my
feet
solid
oak
the
only
walking
for
a
man
he
left
me
hastily
as
though
a
trifle
ashamed
i
thought
he
seemed
depressed
even
a
little
furtive
and
yet
on
analysis
i
could
discover
nothing
definite
on
which
to
base
such
a
conclusion
it
was
rather
a
feeling
of
difference
from
the
man
i
had
known
in
my
fatigue
it
seemed
hardly
worth
thinking
about
the
men
had
rolled
themselves
in
their
blankets
tired
with
the
long
day
next
morning
captain
selover
was
ashore
early
he
had
quite
recovered
his
spirits
and
offered
me
a
dram
of
french
brandy
which
i
refused
we
worked
hard
again
again
the
master
returned
at
night
to
his
vessel
this
time
without
a
word
to
any
of
us
again
the
men
drugged
by
toil
turned
in
early
and
slept
like
the
dead
we
became
entangled
in
a
mesh
of
days
like
these
during
which
things
were
accomplished
but
in
which
was
no
space
for
anything
but
the
tasks
imposed
upon
us
the
men
for
the
most
part
had
little
to
say
por
dios
eet
is
too
mooch
work
sighed
perdosa
once
why
do
you
kick
to
the
old
man
then
sneered
thrackles
the
silence
that
followed
and
the
sullenness
with
which
perdosa
readdressed
himself
to
his
work
was
significant
enough
of
captain
selover
past
relations
with
the
men
and
how
we
did
clean
her
we
stripped
her
of
every
stitch
and
sliver
until
she
floated
high
an
empty
hull
even
her
spars
and
running
rigging
ashore
i
understood
now
the
crew
grumbling
we
literally
went
at
her
with
a
nail
brush
captain
selover
took
charge
of
us
when
we
had
reached
this
period
he
and
the
nigger
and
perdosa
had
long
since
finished
the
installation
of
the
permanent
camp
they
had
built
us
huts
from
the
wreck
collecting
stateroom
doors
for
the
sides
and
hatches
for
the
roofs
huge
and
solid
with
iron
rings
in
them
the
bronze
and
iron
ventilation
gratings
to
the
doors
gave
us
glimpses
of
the
coast
through
fretwork
the
rich
inlaying
of
woods
surrounded
us
we
set
up
on
a
solid
rock
the
galley
stove
with
its
rails
to
hold
the
cooking
pots
from
upsetting
in
a
sea
way
in
it
we
burned
the
débris
of
the
wreck
all
sorts
of
wood
some
sweet
and
aromatic
and
spicy
as
an
incensed
cathedral
i
have
seen
the
nigger
boiling
beans
over
a
blaze
of
sandal
wood
fragrant
as
an
eastern
shop
first
we
scrubbed
the
then
we
painted
her
and
resized
and
tarred
her
standing
rigging
resized
and
rove
her
running
gear
slushed
her
masts
finally
careened
her
and
scraped
and
painted
her
below
when
we
had
quite
finished
we
had
the
anchor
chain
dealt
out
to
us
in
fathoms
and
scraped
pounded
and
polished
that
these
were
indeed
days
full
of
labour
being
busy
from
morning
until
night
we
knew
but
little
of
what
was
about
us
we
saw
the
open
sea
and
the
waves
tumbling
over
the
reef
outside
we
saw
the
headlands
and
the
bow
of
the
bay
and
the
surf
with
its
watching
seals
and
the
curve
of
yellow
sands
we
saw
the
sweep
of
coast
and
the
downs
and
the
strange
huts
we
had
built
out
of
departed
magnificence
and
that
was
all
that
constituted
our
world
in
the
evening
sometimes
we
lit
a
big
bonfire
sailor
fashion
just
at
the
edge
of
the
beach
there
we
sat
at
ease
and
smoked
our
pipes
in
silence
too
tired
to
talk
even
handy
solomon
song
was
still
outside
the
circle
of
light
were
mysterious
things
strange
wavings
of
white
hands
bendings
of
figures
callings
of
voices
rustling
of
feet
we
knew
them
for
the
surf
and
the
wind
in
the
grasses
but
they
were
not
the
less
mysterious
for
that
logically
captain
selover
and
i
should
have
passed
most
of
our
evenings
together
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
so
spent
very
few
early
in
the
dusk
the
captain
invariably
rowed
himself
out
to
his
beloved
schooner
what
he
did
there
i
do
not
know
we
could
see
his
light
now
in
one
part
of
her
now
in
the
other
the
men
claimed
he
was
scrubbing
her
teeth
old
scrubs
they
called
him
to
his
back
never
captain
selover
he
has
to
clean
up
after
his
own
feet
he
so
dirty
sagely
proffered
handy
solomon
and
this
was
true
the
seaman
prophecy
held
good
seven
weeks
held
us
at
that
infernal
job
seven
weeks
of
solid
grinding
work
the
worst
of
it
was
that
we
were
kept
at
it
so
breathlessly
as
though
our
very
existence
were
to
depend
on
the
headlong
rush
of
our
labour
and
then
we
had
fully
half
the
stores
to
put
away
again
and
the
other
half
to
transport
painfully
over
the
neck
of
land
from
the
cove
to
the
beach
so
accustomed
had
i
become
to
the
routine
in
which
we
were
involved
so
habituated
to
anticipating
the
coming
day
as
exactly
like
the
day
that
had
gone
that
the
completion
of
our
job
caught
me
quite
by
surprise
i
had
thrown
myself
down
by
the
fire
prepared
for
the
some
old
half
hour
of
drowsy
nicotine
to
be
followed
by
the
accustomed
heavy
sleep
and
the
usual
early
rising
to
toil
the
evening
was
warm
i
half
closed
my
eyes
handy
solomon
was
coming
in
last
instead
of
dropping
to
his
place
he
straddled
the
fire
stretching
his
arms
over
his
head
he
let
them
fall
with
a
sharp
exhalation
aloft
lay
aloft
the
jolly
cried
high
blow
low
what
care
we
ahead
look
astern
look
look
on
the
coast
of
the
high
the
effect
was
electrical
we
all
sprang
to
our
feet
and
fell
to
talking
at
once
by
god
we
cried
pulz
i
clean
forgot
it
the
nigger
piled
on
more
wood
we
drew
closer
about
the
fire
all
the
interests
in
life
so
long
held
in
the
background
leaped
forward
eager
for
recognition
we
spoke
of
trivialities
almost
for
the
first
time
since
our
landing
fused
into
a
temporary
but
complete
good
fellowship
by
the
relief
wonder
how
the
old
doctor
is
getting
on
ventured
thrackles
after
a
while
the
devil
a
preacher
i
wonder
cried
handy
solomon
let
make
a
call
suggested
pulz
do
believe
they
appreciate
the
compliment
i
laughed
better
let
them
make
first
call
they
the
longer
established
this
was
lost
on
them
of
course
but
we
all
felt
kindly
to
one
another
that
evening
i
carried
the
glow
of
it
with
me
over
until
next
morning
and
was
therefore
somewhat
dashed
to
meet
captain
selover
with
clouded
brows
and
an
uncertain
manner
he
quite
ignored
my
greeting
by
god
eagen
he
squeaked
can
you
think
of
anything
more
to
be
done
i
straightened
my
back
and
laughed
have
you
worked
us
hard
enough
i
inquired
unless
you
gild
the
cabins
i
do
see
what
else
there
can
be
to
do
captain
selover
stared
me
over
and
you
a
naval
man
he
marvelled
do
you
see
that
the
only
thing
that
keeps
this
crew
from
gettin
restless
is
keeping
them
busy
i
sweat
a
damn
sight
more
with
my
brain
than
you
have
with
your
back
thinking
up
things
to
do
i
ca
see
anything
ahead
and
then
we
have
hell
to
pay
oh
they
a
sweet
lot
i
whistled
and
my
crest
fell
here
was
a
new
point
of
view
and
also
a
new
captain
ezra
where
was
the
confidence
in
the
might
of
his
two
hands
he
seemed
to
read
my
thoughts
and
went
on
i
do
feel
here
on
this
cussed
land
it
ai
like
a
deck
where
a
man
has
some
show
they
can
scatter
they
can
hide
it
ai
right
to
put
a
man
ashore
alone
with
such
a
crew
i
doing
my
best
but
it
ai
goin
to
be
good
enough
i
wisht
we
were
safe
in
harbour
he
would
have
maundered
on
but
i
seized
his
arm
and
led
him
out
of
possible
hearing
of
the
men
here
buck
up
i
said
to
him
sternly
there
nothing
to
be
scared
of
if
it
comes
to
a
row
there
three
of
us
and
we
got
guns
we
could
even
sail
the
schooner
at
a
pinch
and
leave
them
here
stood
them
off
before
not
ashore
protested
captain
selover
weakly
well
they
do
know
that
for
god
sake
do
let
them
see
lost
your
nerve
this
way
he
did
not
even
wince
at
the
accusation
put
up
a
front
he
shook
his
head
the
sand
had
completely
run
out
of
him
yet
i
am
convinced
that
if
he
could
have
felt
the
heave
and
roll
of
the
deck
beneath
him
he
would
have
faced
three
times
the
difficulties
he
now
feared
however
i
could
see
readily
enough
the
wisdom
of
keeping
the
men
at
work
you
can
wreck
the
i
suggested
i
do
know
whether
there
anything
left
worth
salvage
but
it
be
something
to
do
he
clapped
me
on
the
shoulder
good
he
cried
i
never
thought
of
it
another
thing
said
i
you
better
give
them
a
day
off
a
week
that
ca
hurt
them
and
it
waste
just
that
much
more
time
all
right
agreed
captain
selover
another
thing
yet
you
know
i
not
lazy
so
it
ai
that
i
trying
to
dodge
work
but
you
better
lay
me
off
it
be
so
much
more
for
the
others
that
true
said
he
i
could
not
recognise
the
man
for
what
i
knew
him
to
be
he
groped
as
one
in
the
dark
or
as
a
sea
animal
taken
out
of
its
element
and
placed
on
the
sands
courage
had
given
place
to
fear
decision
to
wavering
and
singleness
of
purpose
to
a
divided
counsel
he
who
had
so
thoroughly
dominated
the
entire
ship
eagerly
accepted
advice
of
me
a
man
without
experience
that
evening
i
sat
apart
considerably
disturbed
i
felt
that
the
ground
had
dropped
away
beneath
my
feet
to
be
sure
everything
was
tranquil
at
present
but
now
i
understood
the
source
of
that
tranquillity
and
how
soon
it
must
fail
with
opportunity
would
come
more
scheming
more
speculation
more
cupidity
how
was
i
to
meet
it
with
none
to
back
me
but
a
scared
man
an
absorbed
man
and
an
indifferent
man
viii
wrecking
of
the
golden
horn
percy
darrow
unexpected
made
his
first
visit
to
us
the
very
next
evening
he
sauntered
in
with
a
mexican
cigarette
between
his
lips
carrying
a
lantern
blew
the
light
out
and
sat
down
with
a
careless
greeting
as
though
he
had
seen
us
only
the
day
before
hullo
boys
said
he
been
busy
how
are
ye
sir
replied
handy
solomon
good
lord
mates
look
at
that
our
eyes
followed
the
direction
of
his
forefinger
against
the
dark
blue
of
the
evening
sky
to
northward
glowed
a
faint
phosphorescence
from
which
shot
with
pulsating
regularity
long
shafts
of
light
they
beat
almost
to
the
zenith
and
back
again
a
half
dozen
times
then
the
whole
illumination
disappeared
with
the
suddenness
of
gas
turned
out
now
i
wonder
what
that
might
be
marvelled
thrackles
northern
lights
hazarded
pulz
i
seen
them
almost
like
that
in
the
behring
seas
northern
lights
your
eye
sneered
handy
solomon
you
may
have
seen
them
in
the
behring
seas
but
never
this
far
south
and
in
august
and
you
can
kiss
the
book
on
that
what
do
you
think
sir
thrackles
inquired
of
the
assistant
devil
fire
replied
percy
darrow
briefly
the
island
a
little
queer
i
noticed
it
before
debbil
fire
repeated
the
nigger
darrow
turned
directly
to
him
yes
devil
fire
and
devils
too
for
all
i
know
and
certainly
vampires
did
you
ever
hear
of
vampires
doctor
no
growled
the
nigger
well
they
are
women
wonderful
beautiful
women
a
man
on
a
long
voyage
would
just
smack
his
lips
to
see
them
they
have
shiny
grey
eyes
and
lips
red
as
raspberries
when
you
meet
them
they
will
talk
with
you
and
go
home
with
you
and
then
when
you
asleep
they
tear
a
little
hole
in
your
neck
with
their
sharp
claws
and
they
suck
the
blood
with
their
red
lips
when
they
are
women
they
take
the
shape
of
big
bats
like
birds
he
turned
to
me
with
so
beautifully
casual
an
air
that
i
wanted
to
clap
him
on
the
back
with
the
joy
of
it
by
the
way
eagen
have
you
noticed
those
big
bats
the
last
few
evenings
over
by
the
cliff
ca
make
out
in
the
dusk
whether
they
are
vampires
or
just
plain
bats
he
directed
his
remarks
again
to
the
nigger
next
time
you
see
any
of
those
big
bats
doctor
just
you
notice
close
if
they
have
just
plain
black
eyes
all
right
but
if
they
have
grey
eyes
with
red
rims
around
they
vampires
i
wish
you
let
me
know
if
you
do
find
out
interesting
don
get
me
near
no
bats
growled
the
nigger
where
selover
inquired
darrow
he
stays
aboard
i
hastened
to
say
wants
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
ship
that
laudable
what
have
you
been
doing
we
been
cleaning
ship
just
finished
yesterday
evening
what
next
we
were
thinking
of
wrecking
the
quite
right
well
if
you
want
any
help
with
your
engines
or
anything
of
the
sort
call
on
me
he
arose
and
began
to
light
his
lantern
i
hope
as
how
you
getting
on
well
there
above
sir
ventured
handy
solomon
insinuatingly
very
well
i
thank
you
my
man
replied
percy
darrow
drily
remember
those
vampires
doctor
he
swung
the
lantern
and
departed
without
further
speech
we
followed
the
spark
of
it
until
it
disappeared
in
the
arroyo
behind
us
bellowed
the
sea
over
against
us
in
the
sky
was
the
dull
threatening
glow
of
the
volcano
about
us
were
mysterious
noises
of
crying
birds
barking
seals
rustling
or
rushing
winds
i
felt
the
thronging
ghosts
of
all
the
old
world
superstition
swirling
madly
behind
us
in
the
eddies
that
twisted
the
smoke
of
our
fire
we
wrecked
the
forward
was
a
donkey
engine
which
we
took
to
pieces
and
put
together
again
it
was
no
mean
job
for
all
the
running
parts
had
to
be
cleaned
smooth
and
with
the
exception
of
a
rudimentary
knowledge
on
the
part
of
pulz
and
perdosa
we
were
ignorant
in
fact
we
should
not
have
succeeded
at
all
had
it
not
been
for
percy
darrow
and
his
lantern
the
first
evening
we
took
him
over
to
the
cliff
edge
he
laughed
aloud
jove
boys
how
could
you
guess
it
wrong
he
wondered
with
a
few
brief
words
he
set
us
right
pulz
perdosa
and
i
listening
intently
the
others
indifferent
in
the
hopelessness
of
being
able
to
comprehend
of
course
we
went
wrong
again
in
our
next
experiments
but
darrow
was
down
two
or
three
times
a
week
and
gradually
we
edged
toward
a
practical
result
his
explanations
consumed
but
a
few
moments
after
they
were
finished
we
adjourned
to
the
fire
thus
we
came
gradually
to
a
better
acquaintance
with
the
assistant
in
many
respects
he
remained
always
a
puzzle
to
me
certainly
the
men
never
knew
how
to
take
him
he
was
evidently
not
only
unafraid
of
them
but
genuinely
indifferent
to
them
yet
he
displayed
a
certain
interest
in
their
needs
and
affairs
his
practical
knowledge
was
enormous
i
think
i
have
told
you
of
the
completeness
of
his
arrangements
everything
had
been
foreseen
from
grindstones
to
gas
nippers
the
same
quality
of
concrete
speculation
showed
him
what
we
lacked
in
our
own
lives
there
was
as
you
remember
the
matter
of
handy
solomon
steel
claw
he
showed
thrackles
a
kind
of
lanyard
knot
that
person
had
never
used
he
taught
captain
selover
how
to
make
soft
soap
out
of
one
species
of
seaweed
me
he
initiated
in
the
art
of
fishing
with
a
white
bone
lure
our
camp
itself
he
reconstructed
on
scientific
lines
so
that
we
enjoyed
less
aromatic
smoke
and
more
palatable
dinner
and
all
of
it
he
did
amusedly
as
though
his
ideas
were
almost
too
obvious
to
need
communication
we
became
in
a
manner
intimate
with
him
he
guyed
the
men
in
his
indolent
fashion
playing
on
their
credulity
their
good
nature
even
their
forbearance
they
alternately
grinned
and
scowled
he
left
always
a
confused
impression
so
that
no
one
really
knew
whether
he
cherished
rancour
against
percy
darrow
or
kindly
feeling
the
nigger
was
darrow
especial
prey
the
assistant
had
early
discovered
that
the
cook
was
given
to
signs
omens
and
superstitions
from
a
curious
scholar
lore
he
drew
fantastics
with
which
to
torment
his
victim
we
heard
of
all
the
witches
warlocks
incubi
succibi
harpies
devils
imps
and
haunters
of
avitchi
from
all
the
teachings
of
history
sacred
and
profane
hindu
egyptian
greek
mediaeval
swedenborg
rosicrucian
theosophy
theology
with
every
last
ounce
of
horror
mystery
shivers
and
creeps
squeezed
out
of
them
they
were
gorgeous
ghost
stories
for
they
were
told
by
a
man
fully
informed
as
to
all
the
legendary
and
gruesome
details
at
first
i
used
to
think
he
might
have
communicated
it
more
effectively
then
i
saw
that
the
cool
drawling
manner
the
level
voice
were
in
reality
the
highest
art
he
told
his
stories
in
a
detached
manner
which
imposed
confidence
more
readily
than
any
amount
of
earnest
asseveration
the
mere
fact
of
his
own
belief
in
what
he
said
came
to
matter
little
he
was
the
vehicle
by
which
was
brought
accurate
knowledge
he
had
read
all
these
things
and
now
reported
them
as
he
had
read
each
man
could
decide
for
himself
as
to
their
credibility
at
last
the
donkey
engine
was
cleared
and
reinstalled
atop
the
cliff
the
nigger
built
under
her
a
fire
of
black
walnut
captain
selover
handed
out
grog
all
around
and
we
started
her
up
with
a
cheer
just
to
see
the
wheels
revolve
next
we
half
buried
some
long
hatches
end
up
to
serve
as
bitts
for
the
lines
hitched
our
cables
to
them
and
joyfully
commenced
the
task
of
pulling
the
piece
by
piece
up
the
side
of
the
cliff
the
stores
were
badly
damaged
by
the
wet
and
there
was
no
liquor
for
which
i
was
sincerely
grateful
we
broke
into
the
boxes
and
arrayed
ourselves
in
various
garments
which
speedily
fell
to
pieces
and
appropriated
of
all
sorts
there
were
some
arms
but
the
ammunition
had
gone
bad
perdosa
out
of
forty
or
fifty
got
one
feeble
sputter
and
a
tremendous
which
blew
up
his
piece
leaving
only
the
stock
in
his
hand
a
few
tinned
goods
were
edible
but
all
the
rest
was
destroyed
a
lot
of
hard
woods
a
thousand
feet
of
chain
cable
and
a
fairly
good
anchor
might
be
considered
as
prizes
as
for
the
rest
it
was
foolishness
but
we
hauled
it
up
just
the
same
until
nothing
at
all
remained
then
we
shut
off
the
donkey
engine
and
put
on
dry
clothes
we
had
been
quite
happy
for
the
eight
months
it
was
now
well
along
toward
spring
the
winter
had
been
like
summer
and
with
the
exception
of
a
few
rains
of
a
week
or
so
we
had
enjoyed
beautiful
skies
the
seals
had
thinned
out
considerably
but
were
now
returning
in
vast
numbers
ready
for
their
annual
domestic
arrangements
our
sundays
we
had
mostly
spent
in
resting
or
in
fishing
there
were
many
deep
sea
fish
to
be
had
of
great
palatability
but
small
gameness
they
came
like
so
many
leaden
weights
a
few
of
us
had
climbed
some
of
the
hills
in
a
curiosity
but
from
their
summits
saw
nothing
to
tempt
weariness
practically
we
knew
nothing
beyond
the
mile
or
so
of
beach
on
which
we
lived
captain
selover
had
made
a
habit
of
coming
ashore
at
least
once
during
the
day
he
had
contented
himself
with
standing
aloof
but
i
took
pains
to
seem
to
confer
with
him
so
that
the
men
might
suppose
that
i
as
mate
was
engaged
in
carrying
out
his
directions
the
dread
of
him
was
my
most
potent
influence
over
them
during
the
last
few
days
of
our
wrecking
captain
selover
had
omitted
his
daily
visit
the
fact
made
me
uneasy
so
that
at
my
first
opportunity
i
sculled
myself
out
to
the
schooner
i
found
him
as
usual
leaning
against
the
mainmast
doing
nothing
we
finished
sir
said
i
he
looked
at
me
will
you
come
ashore
and
have
a
look
sir
i
inquired
i
ai
going
ashore
again
he
muttered
thickly
what
i
cried
i
ai
going
ashore
again
he
repeated
obstinately
and
all
there
is
to
it
it
too
much
of
a
strain
on
any
man
suit
yourself
you
run
them
i
shipped
as
captain
of
a
vessel
i
no
dock
walloper
i
wo
it
for
no
man
i
gasped
with
dismay
at
the
man
complete
moral
collapse
it
seemed
incredible
i
caught
myself
wondering
whether
he
would
recover
tone
were
he
again
to
put
to
sea
my
god
man
but
you
i
cried
at
last
i
wo
and
that
flat
said
he
and
turned
deliberately
on
his
heel
and
disappeared
in
the
cabin
i
went
ashore
thoughtful
and
a
little
scared
but
on
reflection
i
regained
a
great
part
of
my
ease
of
mind
you
see
i
had
been
with
these
men
now
eight
months
during
which
they
had
been
as
orderly
as
so
many
primary
schoolboys
they
had
worked
hard
without
grumbling
and
had
even
approached
a
sort
of
friendliness
about
the
camp
fire
my
first
impression
was
overlaid
as
i
looked
back
on
the
voyage
with
what
i
took
to
be
a
clearer
vision
i
could
not
but
admit
that
the
incidents
were
in
themselves
trivial
enough
a
natural
excitement
by
a
superstitious
negro
a
little
tall
talk
that
meant
nothing
it
must
have
been
the
glamour
of
the
adventure
that
had
deceived
me
that
and
the
unusual
stage
setting
and
costuming
certainly
few
men
would
work
hard
for
eight
months
without
a
murmur
without
a
chance
to
look
about
them
in
that
of
course
i
was
deceived
by
my
inexperience
i
realised
later
the
wonderful
effect
captain
selover
threw
away
with
his
empty
brandy
bottles
the
crew
might
grumble
and
plot
during
the
watch
below
but
when
captain
ezra
selover
said
they
worked
he
had
been
saying
work
for
eight
months
they
had
from
force
of
experience
obeyed
him
it
was
all
very
simple
ix
the
empty
brandy
bottle
so
there
i
was
at
once
deprived
of
my
chief
support
although
no
danger
seemed
imminent
nevertheless
the
necessity
of
acting
on
my
own
initiative
and
responsibility
oppressed
me
somewhat
truth
to
tell
after
the
first
i
was
more
relieved
than
dismayed
at
the
captain
resolution
to
stay
aboard
his
drinking
habit
was
growing
on
him
and
afloat
or
ashore
he
was
now
little
more
than
a
figurehead
so
that
my
chief
asset
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
was
rather
his
reputation
than
his
direct
influence
in
contact
with
the
men
i
dreaded
lest
sooner
or
later
he
do
something
to
lessen
or
destroy
the
awe
in
which
they
held
him
of
course
schermerhorn
had
been
mistaken
in
his
man
a
real
captain
of
men
would
have
risen
to
circumstances
wherever
he
found
them
but
who
could
have
foretold
captain
selover
had
been
a
rascal
always
but
a
successful
and
courageous
rascal
he
had
run
desperate
chances
dominated
desperate
crews
who
could
know
that
a
crumble
of
island
beach
and
six
months
ashore
would
turn
him
into
what
he
had
become
yet
i
believe
such
cases
are
not
uncommon
in
other
walks
of
life
a
man
and
his
work
combine
to
mean
something
yet
both
may
be
absolutely
useless
when
separated
it
was
the
weak
link
i
put
in
some
time
praying
earnestly
that
the
eyes
of
the
crew
might
be
blinded
and
that
the
doctor
would
finish
his
experiments
before
the
cauldron
could
boil
up
again
my
first
act
as
real
commander
was
to
announce
holiday
my
idea
was
that
the
island
would
keep
the
men
busy
for
a
while
then
i
would
assign
them
more
work
to
do
they
proposed
at
once
a
tour
into
the
interior
we
started
up
the
west
coast
after
three
or
four
miles
along
a
mesa
formation
where
often
we
had
to
circle
long
detours
to
avoid
the
gullies
we
came
upon
another
short
beach
and
beyond
it
a
series
of
ledges
on
which
basked
several
hundred
seals
they
did
not
seem
alarmed
in
fact
one
old
bull
scarred
by
many
battles
made
toward
us
we
left
him
scaled
the
cliff
and
turned
up
a
broad
pleasant
valley
toward
the
interior
there
the
later
lava
flow
had
been
deflected
all
that
showed
of
the
original
eruption
were
occasional
red
outcropping
rocks
soil
and
grass
had
overlaid
the
mineral
scattered
trees
were
planted
throughout
the
flat
cacti
and
bushes
mingled
with
brush
on
the
rounded
side
hills
a
number
of
brilliant
birds
fluttered
at
our
approach
suddenly
handy
solomon
who
was
in
advance
stopped
and
pointed
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
a
file
of
animals
moved
along
the
sky
line
mutton
said
he
or
the
devil
a
preacher
sheep
cried
thrackles
where
did
they
come
from
i
suggested
remember
that
wide
empty
deck
forward
they
carried
sheep
there
the
men
separated
intending
fresh
meat
the
affair
was
ridiculous
these
sheep
had
become
as
wild
as
deer
our
surrounding
party
with
its
silly
bared
knives
could
only
look
after
them
as
they
skipped
nimbly
between
its
members
get
a
gun
of
the
old
man
eagen
suggested
pulz
and
we
have
something
besides
salt
horse
and
fish
i
nodded
we
continued
the
island
was
like
this
as
far
as
we
went
when
we
climbed
a
ridge
we
found
ourselves
looking
down
on
a
of
other
valleys
and
cañons
of
the
same
nature
all
diverging
to
broad
downs
and
a
jump
into
the
sea
all
converging
to
the
outworks
that
guarded
the
volcano
with
its
canopy
of
vapour
on
our
way
home
we
cut
across
the
higher
country
and
the
heads
of
the
cañons
until
we
found
ourselves
looking
down
on
the
valley
and
schermerhorn
camp
the
steam
from
the
volcanic
blowholes
swayed
below
us
through
its
rifts
we
saw
the
tops
of
the
buildings
presently
we
made
out
percy
darrow
dressed
in
overalls
his
sleeves
rolled
back
and
carrying
a
retort
he
walked
very
preoccupied
to
one
of
the
miniature
craters
where
he
knelt
and
went
through
some
operation
indistinguishable
at
the
distance
i
looked
around
to
see
my
companions
staring
at
him
fascinated
their
necks
craned
out
their
bodies
drawn
back
into
hiding
in
a
moment
he
had
finished
and
carried
the
retort
carefully
into
the
laboratory
the
men
sighed
and
stood
erect
once
more
themselves
as
we
turned
away
perdosa
voiced
what
must
have
been
in
the
minds
of
all
a
man
could
climb
down
there
said
he
why
should
he
want
to
i
demanded
sharply
shrugged
he
we
turned
in
silence
toward
the
beach
each
brooded
his
thoughts
the
sight
of
that
man
dressed
in
overalls
carrying
on
some
mysterious
business
brought
home
to
each
of
us
the
fact
that
our
expedition
had
an
object
as
yet
unknown
to
us
the
thought
had
of
late
dropped
into
the
background
for
my
part
i
had
been
so
immersed
in
the
adventure
and
the
labour
and
the
insistent
need
of
the
hour
that
i
had
forgotten
why
i
had
come
schermerhorn
purpose
was
as
inscrutable
to
me
as
at
first
what
had
i
accomplished
the
men
too
seemed
struck
with
some
such
idea
there
were
no
yarns
about
the
camp
fire
that
night
percy
darrow
did
not
appear
for
which
i
was
sincerely
sorry
his
presence
might
have
created
a
diversion
for
some
unknown
reason
all
my
old
apprehensions
my
sense
of
impending
disaster
had
returned
to
me
strengthened
in
the
firelight
the
nigger
sullen
face
looked
sinister
pulz
nervous
white
countenance
looked
vicious
thrackles
heavy
bulldog
expression
was
threatening
perdosa
mexican
cast
fit
for
knife
work
in
the
back
and
handy
solomon
stretched
out
leaning
on
his
elbow
with
his
red
headgear
his
snaky
hair
his
hook
nose
his
restless
eye
and
his
glittering
steel
claw
the
glow
wrote
across
his
aura
the
names
of
kid
morgan
blackbeard
they
sat
smoking
staring
into
the
fire
with
mesmerised
eyes
the
silence
got
on
my
nerves
i
arose
impatiently
and
walked
down
the
pale
beach
where
the
stars
glimmered
in
splashes
along
the
wettest
sands
the
black
silhouette
of
the
hills
against
the
dark
blue
of
the
night
sky
the
white
of
breakers
athwart
the
indistinct
heave
of
the
ocean
a
faint
light
marking
the
position
of
the
that
was
everything
in
the
world
i
made
out
some
object
rolled
about
in
the
edge
of
the
at
the
cost
of
wet
feet
i
rescued
it
it
was
an
empty
brandy
bottle
illustration
these
sheep
had
become
as
wild
as
deer
x
change
of
masters
the
next
day
we
continued
our
explorations
by
land
and
so
for
a
week
after
that
i
thought
it
best
not
to
relinquish
all
authority
so
i
organised
regular
expeditions
and
ordered
their
direction
the
men
did
not
object
it
was
all
good
enough
fun
to
them
the
net
results
were
that
we
found
a
nesting
place
of
sea
birds
too
late
in
the
season
for
eggs
a
hot
spring
near
enough
camp
to
be
useful
and
that
was
about
all
the
sheep
were
the
only
animals
on
the
island
although
there
were
several
sorts
of
birds
in
general
the
country
was
as
i
have
described
it
either
volcanic
or
overlaid
with
fertile
earth
in
any
case
it
was
cañon
and
hill
we
soon
grew
tired
of
climbing
and
turned
our
attention
to
the
sea
with
the
surf
boat
we
skirted
the
coast
it
was
impregnable
except
in
three
places
our
own
beach
that
near
the
seal
rookery
and
on
the
south
side
of
the
island
we
landed
at
each
one
of
these
places
but
returning
close
to
the
coast
we
happened
upon
a
cave
mouth
more
or
less
guarded
by
an
outlying
rock
the
day
was
calm
so
we
ventured
in
at
first
i
thought
it
merely
a
gorge
in
the
rock
but
even
while
peering
for
the
end
wall
we
slipped
under
the
archway
and
found
ourselves
in
a
vast
room
our
eyes
were
dazzled
so
we
could
make
out
little
at
first
but
through
the
still
clear
water
the
light
filtered
freely
from
below
showing
the
bottom
as
through
a
sea
glass
we
saw
the
fish
near
the
entrance
and
coral
and
sea
growths
of
marvellous
vividness
they
waved
slowly
as
in
a
draught
of
air
the
medium
in
which
they
floated
was
absolutely
invisible
for
of
course
there
were
no
reflections
from
its
surface
we
seemed
to
be
suspended
in
and
only
when
the
dipping
oars
made
rings
could
we
realise
that
anything
sustained
us
suddenly
the
place
let
loose
in
pandemonium
the
most
fiendish
cries
groans
shrieks
broke
out
confusing
themselves
so
thoroughly
with
their
own
echoes
that
the
volume
of
sound
was
continuous
heavy
splashes
shook
the
water
the
boat
rocked
the
invisible
surface
was
broken
into
facets
we
shrank
terrified
from
all
about
us
glowed
hundreds
of
eyes
like
coals
of
fire
on
a
level
with
us
above
us
almost
over
our
heads
two
by
two
the
coals
were
extinguished
below
us
the
bottom
was
clouded
with
black
figures
darting
rapidly
like
a
school
of
minnows
beneath
a
boat
they
darkened
the
coral
and
the
sands
and
the
glistening
sea
growths
just
as
a
cloud
temporarily
darkens
the
landscape
only
the
occultations
and
brightenings
succeeded
each
other
much
more
swiftly
we
stared
stupefied
our
thinking
power
blurred
by
the
incessent
whirl
of
motion
and
noise
suddenly
thrackles
laughed
aloud
seals
he
shouted
through
his
trumpeted
hands
our
eyes
were
expanding
to
the
twilight
we
could
make
out
the
arch
of
the
room
its
shelves
and
hollows
and
niches
lying
on
them
we
could
discern
the
seals
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
them
all
staring
at
us
all
barking
and
bellowing
as
we
approached
they
scrambled
from
their
elevations
and
diving
to
the
bottom
scurried
to
the
entrance
of
the
cave
we
lay
on
our
oars
for
ten
minutes
then
silence
fell
there
persisted
a
tiny
drip
from
some
point
in
the
darkness
it
merely
accentuated
the
hush
suddenly
from
far
in
the
interior
of
the
hill
there
came
a
long
hollow
it
reverberated
roaring
the
surge
that
had
lifted
our
boat
some
minutes
before
thus
reached
its
journey
end
the
chamber
was
very
lofty
as
we
rowed
cautiously
in
it
lost
nothing
of
its
height
but
something
in
width
it
was
marvellously
coloured
like
all
the
volcanic
rocks
of
this
island
in
addition
some
chemical
drip
had
thrown
across
its
vividness
long
gauzy
streamers
of
white
we
rowed
in
as
far
as
the
faintest
daylight
lasted
us
the
occasional
reverberating
of
the
surges
seemed
as
distant
as
ever
this
was
beyond
the
seal
rookery
on
the
beach
below
it
we
entered
an
open
cleft
of
some
size
to
another
squarer
cave
it
was
now
high
tide
the
water
extended
a
scant
ten
fathoms
to
end
on
an
interior
shale
beach
the
cave
was
a
perfectly
straight
passage
following
the
line
of
the
cleft
how
far
in
it
reached
we
could
not
determine
for
it
too
was
full
of
seals
and
after
we
had
driven
them
back
a
hundred
feet
or
so
their
fiery
eyes
scared
us
out
we
did
not
care
to
put
them
at
bay
the
next
day
i
rowed
out
to
the
and
got
a
rifle
i
found
the
captain
asleep
in
his
bunk
and
did
not
disturb
him
perdosa
and
i
with
infinite
pains
tracked
and
stalked
the
sheep
of
which
i
killed
one
we
found
the
mutton
excellent
the
hunting
was
difficult
and
the
quarry
as
time
went
on
more
and
more
suspicious
but
henceforward
we
did
not
lack
for
fresh
meat
furthermore
we
soon
discovered
that
fine
trolling
was
to
be
had
outside
the
reef
we
rigged
a
sail
for
the
extra
dory
and
spent
much
of
our
time
at
the
sport
i
do
not
know
the
names
of
the
fish
they
were
very
gamy
indeed
and
ran
from
five
to
an
indeterminate
number
of
pounds
in
weight
above
fifty
pounds
our
light
tackle
parted
so
we
had
no
means
of
knowing
how
large
they
may
have
been
thus
we
spent
very
pleasantly
the
greater
part
of
two
weeks
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
made
up
my
mind
that
it
would
be
just
as
well
to
get
back
to
business
accordingly
i
called
perdosa
and
directed
him
to
sort
and
clear
of
rust
the
salvaged
chain
cable
he
refused
flatly
i
took
a
step
toward
him
he
drew
his
knife
and
backed
away
perdosa
said
i
firmly
put
up
that
knife
no
said
he
i
pulled
the
colt
and
raised
it
slowly
to
a
level
with
his
breast
perdosa
i
repeated
drop
that
knife
the
crisis
had
come
but
my
resolution
was
fully
prepared
for
it
i
should
not
have
cared
greatly
if
i
had
had
to
shoot
the
man
as
i
certainly
should
have
done
had
he
disobeyed
there
would
then
have
been
one
less
to
deal
with
in
the
final
accounting
which
strangely
enough
i
now
for
a
moment
never
doubted
would
come
i
had
not
before
aimed
at
a
man
life
so
you
can
see
to
what
tensity
the
baffling
mystery
had
strung
me
perdosa
hesitated
a
fraction
of
an
instant
i
really
think
he
might
have
chanced
it
but
handy
solomon
who
had
been
watching
me
closely
growled
at
him
drop
it
you
fool
he
said
perdosa
let
fall
the
knife
now
get
at
that
cable
i
commanded
still
at
white
heat
i
stood
over
him
until
he
was
well
at
work
then
turned
back
to
set
tasks
for
the
other
men
handy
solomon
met
me
halfway
begging
your
pardon
eagen
said
he
i
want
a
word
with
you
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
i
snapped
still
excited
it
ai
reasonable
not
to
hear
a
man
say
he
advised
in
his
most
conciliatory
manner
i
talking
for
all
of
us
he
paused
a
moment
took
my
silence
for
consent
and
went
ahead
begging
your
pardon
eagen
said
he
we
ai
going
to
do
any
more
useless
work
there
ai
no
laziness
about
us
but
we
going
to
be
busy
at
nothing
all
the
camp
work
and
the
haulin
and
cuttin
and
cleanin
and
the
rest
of
it
we
do
gladly
but
we
goin
to
pound
any
more
cable
and
you
can
kiss
the
book
on
that
you
mean
to
mutiny
i
asked
he
made
a
deprecatory
gesture
put
us
aboard
ship
sir
and
let
us
hear
the
old
man
give
his
orders
and
you
find
no
mutiny
in
us
but
here
ashore
it
different
did
the
old
man
give
orders
to
pound
the
cable
i
represent
the
captain
i
stammered
he
caught
the
evasion
i
thought
so
well
if
you
got
any
kick
on
us
please
sir
go
get
the
old
man
if
he
says
to
our
face
pound
cable
why
pound
cable
it
is
ai
that
right
boys
they
murmured
something
perdosa
deliberately
dropped
his
hammer
and
joined
the
group
my
hand
strayed
again
toward
the
i
would
do
that
said
handy
solomon
almost
kindly
you
kill
us
all
and
good
would
it
do
i
asks
you
that
i
can
cut
down
a
chicken
with
my
knife
at
twenty
feet
you
must
surely
see
sir
that
i
could
have
killed
you
too
easy
while
you
were
covering
pancho
there
this
ai
got
to
be
a
war
eagen
just
because
we
want
to
work
without
any
sense
to
it
there
was
more
of
the
same
sort
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
see
my
dilemma
either
i
would
have
to
abandon
my
attempt
to
keep
the
men
busy
or
i
would
have
to
invoke
the
authority
of
captain
selover
to
do
the
latter
would
be
to
destroy
it
the
master
had
become
a
stuffed
figure
a
bogie
with
which
to
frighten
an
empty
bladder
that
a
prick
would
collapse
with
what
grace
i
could
muster
i
had
to
give
in
you
have
to
have
it
your
own
way
i
suppose
i
snapped
thrackles
grinned
and
pulz
started
to
say
something
but
handy
solomon
with
a
peremptory
gesture
and
a
black
scowl
stopped
him
short
now
that
what
i
calls
right
proper
and
handsome
he
cried
admiringly
we
reely
had
no
right
to
expect
that
boys
as
seamen
from
our
first
officer
you
can
kiss
the
book
on
it
that
very
few
crews
have
such
kind
masters
eagen
has
the
right
and
we
signed
to
it
all
straight
to
work
us
as
he
pleases
and
does
he
do
why
he
up
and
gives
us
a
week
shore
leave
and
then
he
gives
us
light
watches
and
all
the
time
our
pay
goes
on
just
the
same
now
i
calls
right
proper
and
handsome
conduct
or
the
devil
a
preacher
and
i
ventures
with
all
respect
to
propose
three
cheers
for
mr
eagen
they
gave
them
grinning
broadly
the
villain
stood
looking
at
me
a
sardonic
gleam
in
the
back
of
his
eye
then
he
gave
a
little
hitch
to
his
red
head
covering
and
sauntered
away
humming
between
his
teeth
i
stood
watching
him
choked
with
rage
and
indecision
the
humming
broke
into
words
quarter
oh
quarter
the
jolly
pirates
cried
high
blow
low
what
care
but
the
quarter
that
we
gave
them
was
to
sink
them
in
the
sea
on
the
coast
of
the
high
here
you
swab
he
cried
to
thrackles
and
you
pancho
get
some
wood
lively
and
pulz
bring
us
a
pail
of
water
doctor
let
have
duff
to
celebrate
on
the
men
fell
to
work
with
alacrity
xi
the
corrosive
that
evening
i
smoked
in
a
splendid
isolation
while
the
men
whispered
apart
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
smoke
and
to
chew
my
cud
which
was
bitter
there
could
be
no
doubt
however
i
may
have
saved
my
face
that
command
had
been
taken
from
me
by
that
rascal
handy
solomon
i
was
in
two
minds
as
to
whether
or
not
i
should
attempt
to
warn
darrow
or
the
doctor
yet
what
could
i
say
and
against
whom
should
i
warn
them
the
men
had
grumbled
as
men
always
do
grumble
in
idleness
and
had
perhaps
talked
a
little
wildly
but
that
was
nothing
the
only
indisputable
fact
i
could
adduce
was
that
i
had
allowed
my
authority
to
slip
through
my
fingers
and
adequately
to
excuse
that
i
should
have
to
confess
that
i
was
a
writer
and
no
handler
of
men
i
abandoned
the
unpleasant
train
of
thought
with
a
snort
of
disgust
but
it
had
led
me
to
another
in
the
joy
and
uncertainty
of
living
i
had
practically
lost
sight
of
the
reason
for
my
coming
with
me
it
had
always
been
more
the
adventure
than
the
story
my
writing
was
a
a
utilisation
of
what
life
offered
me
i
had
set
sail
possessed
by
the
sole
idea
of
ferreting
out
investigations
but
the
gradual
development
of
affairs
had
ended
by
absorbing
my
every
faculty
now
cast
into
an
eddy
by
my
change
of
fortunes
the
original
idea
regained
its
force
i
was
out
of
the
active
government
of
affairs
with
leisure
on
my
hands
and
my
thoughts
naturally
turned
with
curiosity
again
to
the
laboratory
in
the
valley
darrow
devil
fires
were
again
painting
the
sky
i
had
noticed
them
from
time
to
time
always
with
increasing
wonder
the
men
accepted
them
easily
as
only
one
of
the
unexplained
phenomena
of
a
experience
but
i
had
not
as
yet
hit
on
a
hypothesis
that
suited
me
they
were
not
allied
to
the
aurora
they
differed
radically
from
the
ordinary
volcanic
emanations
and
scarcely
resembled
any
electrical
displays
i
had
ever
seen
the
night
was
cool
the
stars
bright
i
resolved
to
investigate
without
further
delay
i
arose
to
my
feet
and
set
off
into
the
darkness
immediately
one
of
the
group
detached
himself
from
the
fire
and
joined
me
going
for
a
little
walk
sir
asked
handy
solomon
sweetly
quite
right
and
proper
nothin
like
a
little
walk
to
get
you
fit
and
right
for
your
bunk
he
held
close
to
my
elbow
we
got
just
as
far
as
the
stockade
in
the
bed
of
the
arroyo
the
lights
we
could
make
out
now
across
the
zenith
but
owing
to
the
precipitance
of
the
cliffs
and
the
rise
of
the
arroyo
bed
it
was
impossible
to
see
more
handy
solomon
felt
the
defences
carefully
a
man
would
think
sir
it
was
a
cannibal
island
he
observed
all
so
tight
and
here
it
would
take
a
ship
guns
to
batter
her
down
a
man
might
dig
under
these
here
two
gate
logs
if
no
one
was
against
him
like
to
try
it
sir
no
i
answered
gruffly
from
that
time
on
i
was
virtually
a
prisoner
yet
so
carefully
was
my
surveillance
accomplished
that
i
could
place
my
finger
on
nothing
definite
someone
always
accompanied
me
on
my
walks
and
in
the
evening
i
was
herded
as
closely
as
any
cattle
handy
solomon
took
the
direction
of
affairs
off
my
hands
you
may
be
sure
he
set
no
very
heavy
tasks
the
men
cut
a
little
wood
carried
up
a
few
pails
of
water
that
was
all
lacking
incentive
to
stir
about
they
came
to
spend
most
of
their
time
lying
on
their
backs
watching
the
sky
this
in
turn
bred
a
languor
which
is
the
sickest
most
and
affair
invented
by
the
devil
they
could
not
muster
up
energy
enough
to
walk
down
the
beach
and
back
and
yet
they
were
wearied
to
death
of
the
inaction
after
a
little
they
became
irritable
toward
one
another
each
suspected
the
other
of
doing
less
than
he
should
you
who
know
men
will
realise
what
this
meant
the
atmosphere
of
our
camp
became
surly
i
recognised
the
precursor
of
its
becoming
dangerous
one
day
on
a
walk
in
the
hills
i
came
on
thrackles
and
pulz
lying
on
their
stomachs
gazing
down
fixedly
at
schermerhorn
camp
this
was
nothing
extraordinary
but
they
started
guiltily
to
their
feet
when
they
saw
me
and
made
off
growling
under
their
breaths
all
this
that
i
have
told
you
so
briefly
took
time
it
was
the
eating
through
of
men
spirits
by
that
worst
of
corrosives
idleness
i
conceive
it
unnecessary
to
weary
you
with
the
details
the
situation
was
as
yet
uneasy
but
not
alarming
one
evening
i
overheard
the
beginning
of
an
absurd
plot
to
gain
entrance
to
the
valley
that
was
as
far
as
detail
went
i
became
convinced
at
last
that
i
should
in
some
way
warn
percy
darrow
that
seems
a
simple
enough
proposition
does
it
not
but
if
you
will
stop
to
think
one
moment
of
the
difficulties
of
my
position
you
will
see
that
it
was
not
as
easy
as
at
first
it
appears
darrow
still
visited
us
in
the
evening
the
men
never
allowed
me
even
the
chance
of
private
communication
while
he
was
with
us
one
or
two
took
pains
to
stretch
out
between
us
twice
i
arose
when
the
assistant
did
resolved
to
accompany
him
part
way
back
both
times
men
resolutely
escorted
us
and
as
resolutely
separated
us
from
the
opportunity
of
a
single
word
apart
the
crew
never
threatened
me
by
word
or
look
but
we
understood
each
other
i
was
not
permitted
to
row
out
to
the
without
escort
therefore
i
never
attempted
to
visit
her
again
the
men
were
not
anxious
to
do
so
their
awe
of
the
captain
made
them
only
too
glad
to
escape
his
notice
that
empty
shell
of
a
past
reputation
was
my
only
hope
it
shielded
the
arms
and
ammunition
as
i
look
back
on
it
now
the
period
seems
to
me
to
be
one
of
merely
potential
trouble
the
men
had
not
taken
the
pains
to
crystallise
their
ideas
i
really
think
their
compelling
emotion
was
that
of
curiosity
they
wanted
to
it
needed
a
definite
impulse
to
change
that
desire
to
one
of
greed
the
impulse
came
from
percy
darrow
and
his
idle
talk
of
voodoos
as
usual
he
was
directing
his
remarks
to
the
sullen
nigger
voodoos
he
said
of
course
there
are
do
fool
yourself
for
a
minute
on
that
there
are
good
ones
and
bad
ones
you
can
tame
them
if
you
know
how
and
they
will
do
anything
you
want
them
to
pulz
chuckled
in
his
throat
you
do
believe
it
drawled
the
assistant
turning
to
him
well
it
so
you
know
that
heavy
box
we
are
so
careful
of
well
that
got
a
tame
voodoo
in
it
the
others
laughed
what
he
like
asked
the
nigger
gravely
he
a
fine
voodoo
with
wavery
arms
and
green
eyes
and
red
glows
watching
narrowly
its
effect
he
swung
off
into
one
of
the
genuine
old
crooning
voodoo
songs
once
so
common
down
south
now
so
rarely
heard
no
one
knows
what
the
words
mean
they
are
generally
held
to
be
only
a
magic
gibberish
but
the
nigger
sprang
across
the
fire
like
lightning
his
face
altered
by
terror
to
seize
darrow
by
the
shoulders
doan
you
doan
you
he
gasped
shaking
the
assistant
violently
back
and
forth
dat
he
king
voodoo
song
dat
call
him
all
de
voodoo
all
he
stared
wildly
about
in
the
darkness
as
though
expecting
to
see
the
night
thronged
there
was
a
moment
of
confusion
eager
for
any
chance
i
hissed
under
my
breath
danger
look
out
i
could
not
tell
whether
or
not
darrow
heard
me
he
left
soon
after
the
mention
of
the
chest
had
focussed
the
men
interest
well
pulz
began
we
been
here
on
this
spot
o
hell
for
a
long
time
a
year
and
five
months
reckoned
thrackles
a
man
can
do
a
lot
in
that
time
if
he
busy
they
been
busy
yes
wonder
what
they
done
there
was
no
answer
to
this
and
the
sea
lawyer
took
a
new
tack
i
suppose
we
all
getting
double
wages
that
so
and
that
say
four
hunder
for
us
and
eagen
here
i
suppose
the
old
man
do
let
the
schooner
go
for
nothing
two
hundred
and
fifty
a
month
said
i
and
then
would
have
had
the
words
back
they
cried
out
in
prolonged
astonishment
seventeen
months
pursued
the
logician
after
a
few
moments
he
scratched
with
a
stub
of
lead
that
makes
over
eleven
thousand
dollars
since
we
been
out
how
much
do
you
suppose
his
outfit
stands
him
he
appealed
to
me
i
sure
i
ca
tell
you
i
replied
shortly
well
it
a
pile
of
money
anyway
nobody
said
anything
for
some
time
wonder
what
they
done
pulz
asked
again
something
that
pays
big
thrackles
supplied
the
desired
answer
dat
chis
suggested
perdosa
voodoo
muttered
the
nigger
that
to
scare
us
out
said
handy
solomon
with
vast
contempt
that
what
makes
me
sure
it
the
chest
pulz
muttered
some
of
the
jargon
of
alchemy
that
it
approved
handy
solomon
if
we
could
get
we
would
know
how
to
use
it
interrupted
pulz
the
book
said
thrackles
well
the
book
asserted
pulz
pugnaciously
how
do
you
know
what
it
will
be
it
may
be
the
philosopher
stone
and
it
may
be
one
of
these
other
damn
things
and
then
where
we
be
it
was
astounding
to
hear
this
nonsense
bandied
about
so
seriously
and
yet
they
more
than
half
believed
for
they
were
men
of
the
old
school
and
this
was
in
print
thrackles
voiced
approximately
the
general
attitude
philosopher
stone
or
not
something
up
the
old
boy
took
too
good
care
of
that
box
and
he
spending
too
much
money
and
he
got
hold
of
too
much
hell
afloat
to
be
doing
it
for
his
health
you
know
i
smiled
perdosa
he
mak
he
dat
the
nigger
had
entered
one
of
his
black
brooding
moods
from
which
these
men
expected
oracles
get
him
ches
he
muttered
i
see
him
full
full
of
they
listened
to
him
with
vast
respect
and
were
visibly
impressed
so
deep
was
the
sense
of
awe
that
handy
solomon
unbent
enough
to
whisper
to
me
i
do
take
any
stock
in
the
nigger
talk
a
hell
of
a
fool
nigger
but
when
his
eye
looks
like
that
then
you
want
to
listen
close
he
sees
things
then
lots
of
times
he
seen
things
even
last
year
the
he
told
about
her
three
days
ahead
that
why
we
were
so
ready
for
her
he
chuckled
nothing
more
developed
for
a
long
time
except
a
savage
fight
between
pulz
and
perdosa
i
hunted
sheep
fished
wandered
about
always
with
an
escort
tired
to
death
before
he
started
the
thought
came
to
me
to
kill
this
man
and
so
to
escape
and
make
cause
with
the
scientists
my
common
sense
forbade
me
i
begin
to
think
that
common
sense
is
a
very
foolish
faculty
indeed
it
taught
me
the
obvious
that
all
this
idle
vapouring
talk
was
common
enough
among
men
of
this
class
so
common
that
it
would
hardly
justify
a
murder
would
hardly
explain
an
unwarranted
intrusion
on
those
who
employed
me
how
would
it
look
for
me
to
go
to
them
with
these
words
in
my
mouth
the
captain
has
taken
to
drinking
to
dull
the
monotony
the
crew
think
you
are
an
alchemist
and
are
making
diamonds
their
interest
in
this
fact
seemed
to
me
excessive
so
i
killed
one
of
them
and
here
i
am
and
who
are
you
they
could
ask
i
am
a
reporter
would
be
my
only
truthful
reply
you
can
see
the
false
difficulties
of
my
position
i
do
not
defend
my
attitude
undoubtedly
a
born
leader
of
men
like
captain
selover
at
his
best
would
have
known
how
to
act
with
the
proper
decision
both
now
and
in
the
inception
of
the
first
mutiny
at
heart
i
never
doubted
the
reality
of
the
crisis
even
percy
darrow
saw
the
surliness
of
the
men
attitudes
and
with
his
usual
good
sense
divined
the
cause
you
chaps
are
getting
lazy
said
he
why
do
you
do
something
where
the
captain
they
growled
something
about
there
being
nothing
to
do
and
explained
that
the
captain
preferred
to
live
aboard
do
blame
him
said
darrow
but
he
might
give
us
a
little
of
his
squeaky
company
occasionally
boys
i
tell
you
something
about
seals
the
old
bull
seals
have
long
stiff
whiskers
a
foot
long
do
you
know
there
a
market
for
those
whiskers
well
there
is
the
chinese
mount
them
in
gold
and
use
them
for
cleaners
for
their
long
pipes
each
whisker
is
worth
from
six
bits
to
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
why
do
you
kill
a
few
bull
seal
for
the
nothin
to
do
with
a
voodoo
grunted
handy
solomon
darrow
laughed
amusedly
no
this
is
the
truth
he
assured
tell
you
what
i
give
you
boys
six
bits
apiece
for
the
whisker
hairs
and
four
bits
for
the
galls
i
expect
to
sell
them
at
a
profit
next
morning
they
shook
off
their
lethargy
and
went
i
was
practically
commanded
to
attend
this
attitude
had
been
growing
of
late
now
it
began
to
take
a
definite
form
eagan
do
you
want
to
go
hunting
or
eagen
i
guess
just
go
along
with
you
to
stretch
my
legs
had
given
way
to
going
fishing
you
better
come
along
i
had
known
for
a
long
time
that
i
had
lost
any
real
control
of
them
and
that
perhaps
humiliated
me
a
little
however
my
inexperience
at
handling
such
men
and
the
anomalous
character
of
my
position
to
some
extent
consoled
me
in
the
filaments
brushed
across
the
face
of
my
understanding
i
could
discover
none
so
strong
as
to
support
an
overt
act
on
my
part
i
can
not
doubt
that
had
the
affair
come
to
a
focus
i
should
have
warned
the
scientists
even
at
the
risk
of
my
life
in
fact
as
i
shall
have
occasion
to
show
you
i
did
my
best
but
at
the
moment
in
all
policy
i
could
see
my
way
to
little
besides
acquiescence
we
killed
seals
by
sequestrating
the
bulls
surrounding
them
and
clubbing
them
at
a
certain
point
of
the
forehead
it
was
surprising
to
see
how
hard
they
fought
and
how
quickly
they
succumbed
to
a
blow
properly
directed
then
we
stripped
the
mask
with
its
bristle
of
long
whiskers
took
the
gall
and
dragged
the
carcass
into
the
surf
where
it
was
devoured
by
fish
at
first
the
men
pleased
by
the
novelty
stripped
the
skins
the
blubber
often
two
or
three
inches
in
thickness
had
then
to
be
cut
away
from
the
pelt
cube
by
cube
it
was
a
long
an
oily
and
odoriferous
job
we
stunk
mightily
of
seal
oil
our
garments
were
shiny
with
it
the
very
pores
of
our
skins
seemed
to
ooze
it
and
even
after
the
pelt
was
fairly
well
cleared
it
had
still
to
be
tanned
percy
darrow
suggested
the
method
but
the
process
was
long
and
generally
unsatisfactory
with
the
acquisition
of
the
fifth
greasy
heavy
and
piece
of
fur
the
men
interest
in
peltries
waned
they
confined
themselves
in
all
strictness
to
the
trimmings
percy
darrow
showed
us
how
to
clean
the
whiskers
the
process
was
evil
the
masks
were
quite
simply
to
be
advanced
so
far
in
the
way
of
putrefaction
that
the
bristles
would
part
readily
from
their
sockets
the
first
batch
the
men
hung
out
on
a
line
a
few
moments
later
we
heard
a
mighty
squawking
and
rushed
out
to
find
the
island
ravens
making
off
with
the
entire
catch
protection
of
netting
had
to
be
rigged
we
caught
seals
for
a
month
or
so
there
was
novelty
in
it
and
it
satisfied
the
lust
for
killing
as
time
went
on
the
bulls
grew
warier
then
we
made
expeditions
to
outlying
rocks
later
handy
solomon
approached
me
on
another
diplomatic
errand
the
seals
is
getting
shy
sir
said
he
they
are
said
i
the
only
way
to
do
is
to
shoot
them
said
he
quite
like
i
agreed
a
pause
ensued
we
got
no
cartridges
he
insinuated
and
you
taken
charge
of
my
rifle
i
pointed
out
oh
not
a
bit
sir
he
cried
thrackles
he
just
took
it
to
clean
it
you
can
have
it
whenever
you
want
it
sir
i
have
no
cartridges
as
you
have
observed
said
i
there
plenty
aboard
he
suggested
and
they
in
very
good
hands
there
said
i
he
ruminated
a
moment
polishing
the
steel
of
his
hook
against
the
other
arm
of
his
shirt
suddenly
he
looked
up
at
me
with
a
humorous
twinkle
you
afraid
of
us
he
accused
i
was
silent
not
knowing
just
how
to
meet
so
direct
an
attack
no
need
to
be
he
continued
i
said
nothing
he
looked
at
me
shrewdly
then
stood
off
on
another
tack
well
sir
i
did
mean
just
that
i
did
mean
you
was
really
scared
of
us
but
we
gettin
to
know
each
other
livin
here
on
this
old
island
there
ai
no
officers
and
men
ashore
is
there
now
sir
when
we
gets
back
to
the
old
then
we
drops
back
into
our
dooty
again
all
right
and
proper
you
can
kiss
the
book
on
that
old
scrubs
he
knows
that
he
do
want
no
shore
in
his
knows
enough
to
stay
aboard
where
we
all
rather
be
he
stopped
abruptly
spat
and
looked
at
me
i
wondered
whither
this
devious
diplomacy
led
us
still
in
one
way
an
officer
an
officer
and
a
seaman
a
seaman
thinks
you
and
discipline
must
be
held
up
among
mates
ashore
or
afloat
thinks
you
quite
proper
sir
and
i
can
see
you
think
that
the
arms
is
for
the
afterguard
except
in
case
of
trouble
quite
proper
you
can
do
the
shooting
and
you
can
keep
the
cartridges
always
by
you
just
for
discipline
sir
the
man
boldness
in
so
fully
arming
me
was
astonishing
and
his
carelessness
in
allowing
me
aboard
with
captain
selover
astonished
me
still
more
nevertheless
i
promised
to
go
for
the
desired
cartridges
fully
resolved
to
make
an
appeal
a
further
consideration
of
the
elements
of
the
game
convinced
me
however
of
the
fellow
shrewdness
it
was
no
more
dangerous
to
allow
me
a
rifle
under
direct
surveillance
for
the
purposes
of
hunting
than
to
leave
me
my
sawed
off
revolver
which
i
still
retained
the
arguments
he
had
used
against
my
shooting
perdosa
were
quite
as
cogent
now
as
to
the
second
point
i
finding
the
sun
unexpectedly
strong
returned
from
the
cove
for
my
hat
and
so
overheard
the
following
between
thrackles
and
his
leader
what
to
keep
him
from
staying
aboard
cried
thrackles
protesting
well
he
might
acknowledged
handy
solomon
and
then
are
we
the
worse
off
you
ai
going
to
make
a
boat
attack
against
old
scrubs
are
you
thrackles
hesitated
you
can
kiss
the
book
on
it
you
ai
went
on
handy
solomon
easily
nor
me
nor
pulz
nor
the
greaser
nor
the
nigger
nor
none
of
us
all
together
we
had
our
dose
of
that
well
if
he
goes
aboard
and
where
are
we
the
worse
off
i
asks
you
that
but
he
wo
this
is
goin
to
happen
says
he
to
old
scrubs
the
men
needs
you
to
bash
in
their
heads
in
yourself
says
he
you
for
and
if
he
should
come
ashore
could
he
do
i
asks
you
that
we
ai
disobeyed
no
orders
dooly
delivered
we
ready
to
pull
halliards
at
the
word
no
let
him
go
aboard
and
if
he
peaches
to
the
old
man
why
all
the
better
for
it
just
gets
the
old
man
down
on
him
how
about
old
scrubs
do
you
believe
none
in
luck
asked
handy
solomon
aye
well
so
do
i
with
that
used
to
call
joodicious
assistance
i
rowed
out
to
the
very
thoughtful
and
a
little
shaken
by
the
plausible
argument
captain
selover
was
lying
dead
drunk
across
the
cabin
table
i
did
my
best
to
waken
him
but
failed
took
a
score
of
cartridges
no
more
and
departed
sadly
nothing
could
be
gained
by
staying
aboard
every
chance
might
be
lost
besides
an
opening
to
escape
in
the
direction
of
the
laboratory
might
offer
i
as
well
as
they
believed
in
luck
judiciously
assisted
in
the
ensuing
days
i
learned
much
of
the
habits
of
seals
we
sneaked
along
the
cliff
tops
until
over
the
rookeries
then
lay
flat
on
our
stomachs
and
peered
cautiously
down
on
our
quarry
the
seals
had
become
very
wary
a
slight
jar
the
fall
of
a
pebble
sometimes
even
sounds
unnoticed
by
ourselves
were
enough
to
send
them
into
the
water
there
they
lined
up
just
outside
the
surf
their
sleek
heads
glossy
with
the
wet
their
calm
soft
eyes
fixed
unblinkingly
on
us
it
was
useless
to
shoot
them
in
the
water
they
sank
at
once
when
however
we
succeeded
in
gaining
an
advantageous
position
it
was
necessary
to
shoot
with
extreme
accuracy
a
bullet
directly
through
the
back
of
the
head
would
kill
cleanly
a
hit
anywhere
else
was
practically
useless
for
even
in
death
the
animals
seemed
to
retain
enough
blind
instinctive
vitality
to
flop
them
into
the
water
there
they
were
lost
each
rookery
consisted
of
one
tremendous
bull
who
officiated
apparently
as
the
standing
army
a
number
of
smaller
bulls
his
direct
descendants
the
cows
and
the
pups
the
big
bull
held
his
position
by
force
of
arms
occasionally
other
unattached
bulls
would
come
swimming
by
on
arriving
opposite
the
rookery
the
stranger
would
utter
a
peculiar
challenge
it
was
never
refused
by
the
resident
champion
who
promptly
slid
into
the
sea
and
engaged
battle
if
he
conquered
the
stranger
went
on
his
way
if
however
the
stranger
won
the
big
bull
immediately
struck
out
to
sea
abandoning
his
rookery
while
the
swam
in
and
attempted
to
make
his
title
good
with
all
the
younger
bulls
i
have
seen
some
fierce
combats
out
there
in
the
blue
water
they
gashed
each
other
deep
you
can
see
by
this
how
our
hunting
was
never
at
an
end
on
tuesday
we
would
kill
the
boss
bull
of
a
certain
establishment
by
thursday
at
latest
another
would
be
installed
i
learned
curious
facts
about
seals
in
those
days
the
hunting
did
not
appeal
to
me
particularly
because
it
seemed
to
me
useless
to
kill
so
large
an
animal
for
so
small
a
spoil
still
it
was
a
means
to
my
end
and
i
confess
that
the
stalking
the
lying
belly
down
on
the
grass
over
the
surge
and
under
the
clear
sky
was
extremely
pleasant
while
awaiting
the
return
of
the
big
bull
often
we
had
opportunity
to
watch
the
others
at
their
daily
affairs
and
even
the
unresponsive
thrackles
was
struck
with
their
almost
human
intelligence
did
you
know
that
seals
kiss
each
other
and
weep
tears
when
grieved
the
men
often
discussed
among
themselves
the
narrow
dry
cave
there
the
animals
were
practically
penned
in
they
agreed
that
a
great
killing
could
be
made
there
but
the
impossibility
of
distinguishing
between
the
bulls
and
the
cows
deterred
them
the
cave
was
quite
dark
immerced
in
our
own
affairs
thus
the
days
weeks
and
months
went
by
events
had
slipped
beyond
my
control
i
had
embarked
on
a
journalistic
enterprise
and
now
that
purpose
was
entirely
out
of
my
reach
up
the
valley
schermerhorn
and
his
assistant
were
engaged
in
some
experiment
of
whose
very
nature
i
was
still
ignorant
also
i
was
likely
to
remain
so
the
precautions
taken
against
interference
by
the
men
were
equally
effective
against
me
as
if
that
were
not
enough
any
move
of
investigation
on
my
part
would
be
radically
misinterpreted
and
to
my
own
danger
by
the
men
i
might
as
well
have
been
in
london
however
as
to
my
first
purpose
in
this
adventure
i
had
evolved
another
plan
and
therefore
was
content
i
made
up
my
mind
that
on
the
voyage
home
if
nothing
prevented
i
would
tell
my
story
to
percy
darrow
and
throw
myself
on
his
mercy
the
results
of
the
experiment
would
probably
by
then
be
ready
for
the
public
and
there
was
no
reason
as
far
as
i
could
see
why
i
should
not
get
the
scoop
at
first
hand
certainly
my
sincerity
would
be
without
question
and
i
hoped
that
two
years
or
more
of
service
such
as
i
had
rendered
would
tickle
schermerhorn
sense
of
his
own
importance
so
adequate
did
this
plan
seem
that
i
gave
up
thought
on
the
subject
my
whole
life
now
lay
on
the
shores
i
was
not
again
permitted
to
board
the
captain
selover
i
saw
twice
at
a
distance
both
times
he
seemed
to
be
rather
uncertain
the
men
did
not
remark
it
the
days
went
by
i
relapsed
into
that
state
so
well
known
to
you
all
when
one
seems
caught
in
the
meshes
of
a
dream
existence
which
has
had
no
beginning
and
which
is
destined
never
to
have
an
end
we
were
to
hunt
seals
and
fish
and
pry
bivalves
from
the
rocks
at
low
tide
and
build
fires
and
talk
and
alternate
between
suspicion
and
security
between
the
danger
of
sedition
and
the
insanity
of
men
without
defined
purpose
world
without
end
forever
xii
old
scrubs
comes
ashore
the
inevitable
happened
one
noon
pulz
looked
up
from
his
labour
of
pulling
the
whiskers
from
the
masks
how
many
of
these
damn
things
we
got
he
inquired
about
three
hunder
and
fifty
thrackles
replied
well
we
got
enough
for
me
i
sick
of
this
job
it
stinks
they
looked
at
each
other
i
could
see
the
disgust
rising
in
their
eyes
the
reek
of
rotten
blubber
expanding
their
nostrils
with
one
accord
they
cast
aside
the
masks
it
ai
such
a
hell
of
a
fortune
growled
pulz
his
evil
little
white
face
thrust
forward
there
other
things
worth
all
the
seal
trimmin
of
the
islands
diamon
gloomed
the
nigger
you
hit
it
doctor
cut
in
solomon
there
we
were
again
back
to
the
old
difficulty
only
worse
idleness
descended
on
us
again
we
grew
touchy
on
little
things
as
a
misplaced
plate
a
shortage
of
firewood
too
deep
a
draught
at
the
nearly
empty
bucket
the
noise
of
bickering
became
as
constant
as
the
noise
of
the
surf
if
we
valued
peace
we
kept
our
mouths
shut
the
way
a
man
spat
or
ate
or
slept
or
even
breathed
became
a
cause
of
irritation
to
every
other
member
of
the
company
we
stood
the
outrage
as
long
as
we
could
then
we
objected
in
a
wild
and
ridiculous
explosion
which
communicated
its
heat
to
the
object
of
our
wrath
then
there
was
a
fight
it
needed
only
liquor
to
complete
the
deplorable
state
of
affairs
gradually
the
smaller
things
came
to
worry
us
more
and
more
a
certain
harmless
singer
of
the
cricket
or
perhaps
of
the
variety
used
to
chirp
his
innocent
note
a
short
distance
from
our
cabin
for
all
i
know
he
had
done
so
from
the
moment
of
our
installation
but
i
had
never
noticed
him
before
now
i
caught
myself
listening
for
his
irregular
recurrence
with
every
nerve
on
the
quiver
if
he
delayed
by
ever
so
little
it
was
an
agony
yet
when
he
did
pipe
up
his
feeble
strain
struck
to
my
heart
cold
and
paralysing
like
a
dagger
and
with
every
advancing
minute
of
the
night
i
became
broader
awake
more
tense
fairly
sweating
with
nervousness
one
night
good
god
was
it
only
last
week
it
seems
ages
ago
another
existence
a
state
cut
off
from
this
by
the
wonder
of
a
transmigration
at
least
last
week
i
did
not
sleep
at
all
the
moon
had
risen
had
mounted
the
heavens
and
now
was
sailing
overhead
by
the
fretwork
of
its
radiance
through
the
chinks
of
our
cabin
i
had
marked
off
the
hours
a
thunderstorm
rumbled
and
flashed
hull
down
over
the
horizon
it
was
many
miles
distant
and
yet
i
do
not
doubt
that
its
electrical
influence
had
dried
the
moisture
of
our
equanimity
leaving
us
rattling
husks
for
the
winds
of
destiny
to
play
upon
certainly
i
can
remember
no
other
time
in
a
rather
wide
experience
when
i
have
felt
myself
more
on
edge
more
choked
with
the
restless
purposeless
nervous
energy
that
leaves
a
man
tongue
parched
and
his
eyes
staring
and
still
that
infernal
cricket
or
whatever
it
was
chirped
i
had
thought
myself
alone
in
my
vigil
but
when
finally
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
kicked
aside
my
covering
with
an
oath
of
protest
i
was
surprised
to
hear
it
echoed
from
all
about
me
damn
that
cricket
i
cried
and
the
dead
shadows
stirred
from
the
bunks
and
the
victims
of
insomnia
crept
out
to
curse
their
tormentor
we
organised
an
expedition
to
hunt
him
down
it
was
ridiculous
enough
six
strong
men
prowling
for
the
life
of
one
poor
little
insect
we
did
not
find
him
however
though
we
succeeded
in
silencing
him
but
no
sooner
were
we
back
in
our
bunks
than
he
began
it
again
and
such
was
the
turmoil
of
our
nerves
that
day
found
us
sitting
wan
about
a
fire
hugging
our
knees
we
were
so
genuinely
emptied
not
so
much
by
the
cricket
as
by
the
two
years
of
fermentation
that
not
one
of
us
stirred
toward
breakfast
in
fact
not
one
of
us
moved
from
the
listless
attitude
in
which
day
found
him
until
after
nine
then
we
pulled
ourselves
together
and
cooked
coffee
and
salt
horse
as
a
significant
fact
the
nigger
left
the
dishes
unwashed
and
no
one
cared
handy
solomon
finally
shook
himself
and
arose
i
sick
of
this
said
he
i
goin
they
arose
without
a
word
they
were
sick
of
it
too
sick
to
death
we
were
a
silent
gloomy
crew
indeed
as
we
thrust
the
surf
boat
afloat
clambered
in
and
shipped
the
oars
no
one
spoke
a
word
no
one
had
a
comment
to
make
even
when
we
saw
the
rookery
slide
into
the
water
while
we
were
still
fifty
yards
from
the
beach
we
pulled
back
slowly
along
the
coast
beyond
the
rock
we
made
out
the
entrance
to
the
dry
cave
there
seal
in
there
cried
handy
solomon
lots
of
he
thrust
the
rudder
over
and
we
headed
for
the
cave
no
one
expressed
an
opinion
as
it
was
again
high
tide
we
rowed
in
to
the
steep
shore
inside
the
cave
mouth
and
beached
the
boat
the
place
was
full
of
seals
we
could
hear
them
bellowing
two
of
you
stand
here
shouted
handy
solomon
and
take
them
as
they
go
out
we
go
in
and
scare
down
to
you
they
run
over
us
screamed
pulz
no
they
wo
you
can
dodge
up
the
sides
when
they
go
by
this
was
indeed
well
possible
so
we
gripped
our
clubs
and
ventured
into
the
darkness
we
advanced
four
abreast
for
the
cave
was
wide
enough
for
that
as
we
penetrated
the
bellowing
and
barking
became
more
deafening
it
was
impossible
to
see
anything
although
we
an
indistinguishable
tumbling
mass
receding
before
our
footsteps
thrackles
swore
violently
as
he
stumbled
over
a
laggard
with
uncanny
abruptness
the
black
wall
of
darkness
in
front
of
us
was
alive
with
fiery
eyeballs
the
seals
had
reached
the
end
of
the
cave
and
had
turned
toward
us
we
too
stopped
a
little
uncertain
as
to
how
to
proceed
the
first
plan
had
been
to
get
behind
the
band
and
to
drive
it
slowly
toward
the
entrance
to
the
cave
this
was
now
seen
to
be
impossible
the
cavern
was
too
narrow
its
sides
at
this
point
too
steep
and
the
animals
too
thickly
congested
our
eyes
becoming
accustomed
to
the
twilight
now
began
to
make
out
dimly
the
individual
bodies
of
the
seals
and
the
general
configuration
of
the
rocks
one
big
boulder
lay
directly
in
our
path
like
an
island
in
the
shale
of
the
cave
floor
perdosa
stepped
to
the
top
of
it
for
a
better
look
the
men
attempted
to
communicate
their
ideas
of
what
was
to
be
done
but
could
not
make
themselves
heard
above
the
uproar
i
could
see
their
faces
contorting
with
the
fury
of
being
baffled
a
big
bull
made
a
dash
to
get
by
all
the
herd
flippered
after
him
if
he
had
won
past
they
would
have
followed
as
obstinately
as
sheep
and
nothing
could
have
stopped
them
but
the
big
bull
went
down
beneath
the
clubs
thrackles
hit
the
animal
two
vindictive
blows
after
it
had
succumbed
this
settled
the
revolt
and
we
stood
as
before
pulz
and
handy
solomon
tried
to
converse
by
signs
but
evidently
failed
for
their
faces
showed
angry
in
the
twilight
perdosa
on
his
rock
rolled
and
lit
a
cigarette
thrackles
paced
to
and
fro
and
the
nigger
leaned
on
his
club
farther
down
the
cave
they
had
been
left
at
the
entrance
but
now
in
lack
of
results
had
joined
their
companions
now
thrackles
approached
and
screamed
himself
black
trying
to
impart
some
plan
he
failed
but
stooped
and
picked
up
a
stone
and
threw
it
into
the
mass
of
seals
the
others
understood
a
shower
of
stones
followed
the
animals
milled
like
cattle
bellowed
the
louder
but
would
not
face
their
tormentors
finally
an
old
cow
flopped
by
in
a
panic
i
thought
they
would
have
let
her
go
but
she
died
a
little
beyond
the
bull
no
more
followed
although
the
men
threw
stones
as
fast
and
hard
as
they
were
able
their
faces
were
livid
with
anger
like
that
of
an
man
with
an
obstinate
horse
suddenly
handy
solomon
put
his
head
down
and
with
a
roar
distinctly
audible
even
above
the
din
that
filled
the
cave
charged
directly
into
the
herd
i
saw
the
beasts
cringe
before
him
i
saw
his
club
rising
and
falling
indiscriminately
and
then
the
whole
back
of
the
cave
seemed
to
rise
and
come
at
us
this
was
no
chance
of
sport
now
but
a
struggle
for
very
life
we
realised
that
once
down
there
would
be
no
hope
for
while
the
seals
were
more
anxious
to
escape
than
to
fight
we
knew
that
their
jaws
were
powerful
there
was
no
time
to
pick
and
choose
we
hit
out
with
all
the
strength
and
quickness
we
possessed
it
was
like
a
bad
dream
like
struggling
with
an
elusive
monster
knee
high
invulnerable
we
hit
but
without
apparent
effect
new
heads
rose
the
press
behind
increased
we
gave
ground
we
staggered
struggling
desperately
to
keep
our
feet
how
long
this
lasted
i
can
not
tell
it
seemed
hours
i
know
my
arms
became
leaden
from
swinging
my
club
my
eyes
were
full
of
sweat
my
breath
gasped
a
sharp
pain
in
my
knee
nearly
doubled
me
to
the
ground
and
yet
i
remember
clamping
to
the
thought
that
i
must
keep
my
feet
keep
my
feet
at
any
cost
then
all
at
once
i
recalled
the
fact
that
i
was
armed
i
jerked
out
the
colt
and
turned
it
loose
in
their
faces
whether
the
flash
and
detonation
frightened
them
whether
perdosa
still
clinging
to
his
rock
managed
to
turn
their
attention
by
his
flanking
efforts
or
whether
quite
simply
the
wall
of
dead
finally
turned
them
back
i
do
not
know
but
with
one
accord
they
gave
over
the
attempt
i
looked
at
once
for
handy
solomon
and
was
surprised
to
see
him
still
alive
standing
upright
on
a
ledge
the
other
side
of
the
herd
his
clothing
was
literally
torn
to
shreds
and
he
was
covered
with
blood
but
in
this
plight
he
was
not
alone
for
when
i
turned
toward
my
companions
they
too
were
tattered
torn
and
gory
we
were
a
dreadful
crew
standing
there
in
the
our
chests
heaving
our
rags
dripping
red
for
perhaps
ten
seconds
no
one
moved
then
with
a
yell
of
demoniac
rage
my
companions
clambered
over
the
rampart
of
dead
seals
and
attacked
the
herd
the
seals
were
now
cowed
and
defenceless
it
was
a
slaughter
and
the
most
debauching
and
brutal
i
have
ever
known
i
had
hit
out
with
the
rest
when
it
had
been
a
question
of
defence
but
from
this
i
turned
aside
in
a
sick
loathing
the
men
seemed
possessed
of
devils
and
of
their
unnatural
energy
perdosa
cast
aside
the
club
and
took
to
his
natural
weapon
the
knife
i
can
see
him
yet
rolling
over
and
over
embracing
a
big
cow
his
head
jammed
in
an
ecstasy
of
ferocity
between
the
animal
front
flippers
his
legs
clasped
to
hold
her
body
only
his
right
arm
rising
and
falling
as
he
plunged
his
knife
again
and
again
she
struggled
turning
him
over
and
under
wept
great
tears
and
fairly
whined
with
terror
and
pain
finally
she
was
still
and
perdosa
staggered
to
his
feet
only
to
stare
about
him
drunkenly
for
a
moment
before
throwing
himself
with
a
screech
on
another
victim
the
nigger
alone
did
not
jump
into
the
turmoil
he
stood
just
down
the
cave
his
club
ready
occasionally
a
disorganised
rush
to
escape
would
be
made
the
nigger
lips
snarled
and
with
a
truly
mad
enjoyment
he
beat
the
poor
animals
back
i
pressed
against
the
wall
horrified
fascinated
unable
either
to
interfere
or
to
leave
a
close
sticky
smell
took
possession
of
the
air
after
a
little
a
tiny
stream
growing
each
moment
began
to
flow
past
my
feet
it
sought
its
channel
daintily
as
streamlets
do
feeling
among
the
stones
in
eddies
quiet
pools
miniature
falls
and
rapids
for
the
moment
i
did
not
realise
what
it
could
be
then
the
light
caught
it
down
where
the
nigger
waited
and
i
saw
it
was
red
at
first
the
racket
of
the
seals
was
overpowering
now
gradually
it
was
losing
volume
i
began
to
hear
the
blasphemies
ferocious
cries
screams
of
anger
hurled
against
the
cave
walls
by
the
men
the
thick
sticky
smell
grew
stronger
the
light
seemed
to
grow
dimmer
as
though
it
could
not
burn
in
that
fetid
air
a
seal
came
and
looked
up
at
me
big
tears
rolling
from
her
eyes
then
she
flippered
aimlessly
away
out
of
her
poor
wits
with
terror
the
sight
finished
me
i
staggered
down
the
length
of
the
black
tunnel
to
the
boat
after
a
long
interval
a
little
three
months
pup
waddled
down
to
the
water
edge
caught
sight
of
me
and
with
a
squeal
of
fright
dived
far
poor
little
devil
i
would
not
have
hurt
him
for
worlds
as
far
as
i
know
this
was
the
only
survivor
of
all
that
herd
the
men
soon
appeared
one
by
one
tired
glutted
walking
in
a
trance
of
satiety
they
were
blood
and
tatters
from
head
to
foot
and
from
drying
red
masks
peered
their
bloodshot
eyes
not
a
word
said
they
but
tumbled
into
the
boat
pushed
off
and
in
a
moment
we
were
floating
in
the
full
sunshine
again
we
rowed
home
in
an
abstraction
for
the
moment
berserker
rage
had
burned
itself
out
handy
solomon
continually
wetted
his
lips
like
an
animal
licking
its
chops
thrackles
stared
into
space
through
eyes
drugged
with
killing
no
one
spoke
we
landed
in
the
cove
and
were
surprised
to
find
it
in
shadow
the
afternoon
was
far
advanced
over
the
hill
we
dragged
ourselves
and
down
to
the
spring
there
the
men
threw
themselves
flat
and
drank
in
great
gulps
until
they
could
drink
no
more
we
built
a
fire
but
the
nigger
refused
to
cook
someone
else
turn
he
growled
i
cook
aboard
ship
perdosa
who
had
hewed
the
fuel
at
once
became
angry
i
cut
heem
de
wood
he
said
i
do
my
share
eef
i
cut
heem
de
wood
you
mus
cook
heem
de
grub
but
the
nigger
shook
his
head
and
perdosa
went
into
an
ecstasy
of
rage
he
kicked
the
fire
to
pieces
he
scattered
the
unburned
wood
up
and
down
the
beach
he
even
threw
some
of
it
into
the
sea
eef
you
no
cook
heem
de
grub
you
no
hab
my
wood
he
shrieked
with
enough
oaths
to
sink
his
soul
finally
pulz
interfered
here
you
damn
foreigners
said
he
quit
it
let
up
i
say
we
got
to
eat
you
let
that
wood
alone
or
you
pick
it
up
again
perdosa
sprang
at
him
with
a
screech
pulz
was
small
but
nimble
and
understood
rough
and
tumble
fighting
he
met
perdosa
rush
with
two
swift
blows
a
short
arm
jab
and
an
then
they
clinched
and
in
a
moment
were
rolling
over
and
over
just
beyond
the
wash
of
the
surf
the
row
waked
the
nigger
from
his
sullen
abstraction
he
seemed
to
come
to
himself
with
a
start
his
eye
fell
surprisedly
on
the
combatants
then
lit
up
with
an
unholy
joy
he
drew
his
knife
and
crept
down
on
the
fighters
it
was
too
good
an
opportunity
to
pay
off
the
mexican
but
thrackles
interfered
sharply
come
off
he
commanded
none
o
that
go
to
hell
growled
the
nigger
a
great
rage
fell
on
them
all
blind
and
terrible
like
that
leading
to
the
slaughter
of
the
seals
they
fought
indiscriminately
hitting
at
each
other
with
fists
and
knives
it
was
difficult
to
tell
who
was
against
whom
the
sound
of
heavy
breathing
dull
blows
the
tear
of
cloth
and
grunts
of
punishment
received
the
swirl
of
the
sand
the
heave
of
struggling
bodies
all
riveted
my
attention
so
that
i
did
not
see
captain
ezra
selover
until
he
stood
almost
at
my
elbow
stop
he
shrieked
in
his
high
falsetto
voice
and
would
you
believe
it
even
through
the
blood
haze
of
their
combat
the
men
heard
him
and
heeded
they
drew
reluctantly
apart
got
to
their
feet
stood
looking
at
him
through
reeking
brows
half
submissive
and
half
defiant
the
thrackles
even
took
a
half
step
forward
but
froze
in
his
tracks
when
old
scrubs
looked
at
him
i
hire
you
men
to
fight
when
i
tell
you
to
and
only
then
said
the
captain
sternly
what
does
this
mean
he
menaced
them
one
after
another
with
his
eyes
and
one
after
another
they
quailed
all
their
plottings
their
threats
their
dangerousness
dissipated
like
mist
before
the
command
of
this
one
resolute
man
these
pirates
who
had
seemed
so
dreadful
to
me
now
were
nothing
more
than
cringing
schoolboys
before
their
master
and
then
suddenly
to
my
horror
i
watching
closely
saw
the
eye
turn
blank
i
am
sure
the
men
must
have
felt
the
change
though
certainly
they
were
too
far
away
to
see
it
for
they
shifted
by
ever
so
little
from
their
first
frozen
attitude
the
captain
hand
sought
his
pocket
and
they
froze
again
but
instead
of
the
expected
revolver
he
produced
a
brandy
bottle
the
change
in
his
eyes
had
crept
into
his
features
they
had
turned
foolishly
amiable
vacant
confiding
boys
said
he
appealingly
you
good
fellowsh
ai
you
have
a
drink
good
stuff
good
ol
bottl
he
lurched
caught
himself
and
advanced
toward
them
still
with
the
empty
smile
they
stared
at
him
for
ten
seconds
quite
at
a
loss
then
by
god
he
drunk
handy
solomon
breathed
scarcely
louder
than
a
whisper
there
was
no
other
signal
given
they
sprang
as
with
a
single
impulse
one
instant
i
saw
clear
against
the
waning
daylight
the
bulky
form
of
captain
selover
the
next
it
had
disappeared
carried
down
and
obliterated
by
the
rush
of
attacking
bodies
knives
gleamed
ruddy
in
the
sunset
there
was
no
struggle
i
heard
a
deep
groan
then
the
murderers
rose
slowly
to
their

i
make
my
escape
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
run
away
i
do
not
know
why
i
did
not
do
so
but
the
fact
stands
that
i
remained
where
i
was
until
they
had
finished
captain
selover
then
i
took
to
my
heels
but
was
soon
cornered
i
drew
my
revolver
remembered
that
i
had
emptied
it
in
the
seal
cave
and
had
time
for
no
more
coherent
mental
processes
a
smothering
weight
flung
itself
on
me
against
which
i
struggled
as
hard
as
i
could
shrinking
in
anticipation
from
the
thirsty
plunge
of
the
knives
however
though
the
weight
increased
until
further
struggle
was
impossible
i
was
not
harmed
and
in
a
few
moments
found
myself
wrists
and
ankles
tied
beside
a
roaring
fire
while
i
collected
myself
i
heard
the
grate
of
a
boat
being
shoved
off
from
the
cove
and
a
few
moments
later
made
out
lights
aboard
the
the
looting
party
returned
very
shortly
their
plundering
had
gone
only
as
far
as
liquor
and
arms
thrackles
let
down
from
the
cliff
top
a
keg
at
the
end
of
a
line
perdosa
and
the
nigger
each
carried
an
armful
of
the
rifles
the
keg
was
rolled
to
the
fire
and
broached
the
men
got
drunk
wildly
drunk
but
not
helplessly
so
a
flame
communicated
itself
to
them
through
the
liquor
the
ordinary
characteristics
of
their
composition
sprung
into
sharper
relief
the
nigger
became
more
sullen
perdosa
more
pulz
more
viciously
evil
thrackles
more
brutal
while
handy
solomon
staggering
from
his
seat
to
the
open
keg
and
back
again
roaring
fragments
of
a
chanty
his
red
headgear
contrasting
with
his
smoky
black
hair
and
his
swarthy
countenance
he
needed
no
further
touch
their
evil
passions
were
all
awake
and
the
plan
so
long
indefinite
developed
like
a
photographer
plate
that
one
said
thrackles
one
gone
to
hell
and
now
the
diamonds

was
for

and

what

they
demanded
of
the
silent
nigger
but
the
nigger
only
rolled
his
eyes
and
shook
his
head
by
and
by
he
arose
and
disappeared
in
the
dusk
and
was
no
more
seen
dam
fool
muttered
handy

well
here
to

he
drank
a
deep
cup
of
the
raw

and
staggered
back
to

seat
on
the
sands

he
threw
back
his
head
and
roared
forth
a
volume
of
sound
toward
the
dim
stars
broadside
to
broadside
the
gallant
ships
did
lay
high
blow
low
what
care
the
jolly
shot
the
pirate
mast
away
on
the
coast
of
the
high
i
saw
near
me
a
live
coal
dislodged
from
the
fire
when
thrackles
had
thrown
on
the
armful
of
wood
an
idea
came
to
me
i
hitched
myself
to
the
spark
and
laid
across
it
the
rope
with
which
my
wrists
were
tied
this
behind
my
back
was
not
easy
to
accomplish
and
twice
i
burned
my
wrists
before
i
succeeded
fortunately
i
was
at
the
edge
of
illumination
and
behind
the
group
i
turned
over
on
my
side
so
that
my
back
was
toward
the
fire
then
rapidly
i
cast
loose
my
ankle
lashings
thus
i
was
free
and
selecting
a
moment
when
universal
attention
was
turned
toward
the
rum
barrel
i
rolled
over
a
sand
dune
got
to
my
hands
and
knees
and
crept
away
through
the
coarse
grass
i
crept
thus
to
the
very
entrance
of
the
arroyo
then
rose
to
my
feet
in
the
middle
distance
the
fire
leaped
red
its
glow
fell
intermittently
on
the
surges
rolling
in
the
men
staggered
or
lay
prone
either
as
gigantic
silhouettes
or
as
tatterdemalions
painted
by
the
light
the
keg
stood
solid
and
substantial
the
hub
about
which
reeled
the
orgy
at
the
edge
of
the
wash
i
could
make
out
something
prone
dim
limp
thrown
constantly
in
new
positions
of
weariness
as
the
water
ebbed
and
flowed
beneath
it
now
an
arm
thrown
out
now
cast
back
as
though
old
scrubs
slept
feverishly
the
drunkards
were
getting
noisy
handy
solomon
still
reeled
off
the
verses
of
his
song
the
others
joined
in
frightfully
off
the
key
or
punctuated
the
performance
by
wild
staccato
yells
their
coffin
was
their
ship
and
their
grave
it
was
the
sea
high
blow
low
what
care
and
the
quarter
that
we
gave
them
was
to
sink
them
in
the
sea
on
the
coast
of
the
high
bellowed
handy
solomon
i
turned
and
plunged
into
the
cool
darkness
of
the
cañon
xiv
an
adventure
in
the
night
ten
seconds
after
entering
the
arroyo
i
was
stumbling
along
in
an
absolute
blackness
it
almost
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
reach
out
my
hands
and
touch
it
as
one
would
touch
a
wall
or
perhaps
not
exactly
that
for
a
wall
is
hard
and
this
darkness
was
soft
and
yielding
in
the
manner
of
enveloping
hangings
directly
above
me
was
a
narrow
jagged
and
irregular
strip
of
sky
with
stars
i
splashed
in
the
brook
finding
its
waters
strangely
warm
rustled
through
the
grasses
my
head
back
chin
out
hands
extended
as
one
makes
his
way
through
a
house
at
night
there
were
no
sounds
except
the
tinkle
of
the
sulphurous
stream
successive
bends
in
the
cañon
wall
had
shut
off
even
the
faintest
echoes
of
the
bacchanalia
on
the
beach
the
way
seemed
much
longer
than
by
daylight
already
in
my
calculation
i
had
traversed
many
times
the
distance
when
with
a
jump
at
the
heart
i
made
out
a
glow
ahead
and
in
front
of
it
the
upright
logs
of
the
stockade
to
my
surprise
the
gate
was
open
i
ascended
the
gentle
slope
to
the
valley
level
and
stumbled
over
a
man
lying
prostrate
shivering
violently
and
moaning
i
bent
over
to
discover
whom
it
might
be
as
i
did
so
a
brilliant
light
seemed
to
fill
the
valley
throwing
an
illumination
on
the
man
at
my
feet
i
saw
it
was
the
nigger
and
perceived
at
the
same
instant
that
he
was
almost
beside
himself
with
terror
his
eyes
rolled
his
teeth
chattered
his
frame
contracted
in
a
strong
convulsion
and
the
black
of
his
complexion
had
faded
to
a
dirty
grey
revolting
to
contemplate
he
felt
my
touch
and
sprang
to
his
feet
clutching
me
by
the
shoulder
as
a
man
clutching
rescue
my
gawd
he
shivered
look
dar
it
is
again
he
fell
to
pattering
in
a
tongue
unknown
to
me
charms
spells
undoubtedly
to
exorcise
the
devils
that
had
hold
of
him
i
followed
the
direction
of
his
gaze
and
myself
cried
out
the
doctor
laboratory
stood
in
plain
sight
between
the
two
columns
of
steam
blown
straight
upward
through
the
stillness
of
the
evening
it
seemed
bursting
with
light
every
little
crack
leaked
it
in
generous
streams
while
the
main
illumination
appeared
fairly
to
bulge
the
walls
outward
this
was
in
itself
nothing
extraordinary
and
indicated
only
the
activity
of
those
within
but
while
i
looked
an
irregular
patch
of
incandescence
suddenly
splashed
the
cliff
opposite
for
a
single
instant
the
very
substance
of
the
rock
glowed
white
hot
then
from
the
spot
a
shower
of
spiteful
flakes
shot
as
from
a
pyrotechnic
and
the
light
was
blotted
out
as
suddenly
as
it
came
at
the
same
moment
it
appeared
at
another
point
exhibited
the
same
phenomena
died
flashed
out
at
still
a
third
place
and
so
was
repeated
here
and
there
with
bewildering
rapidity
until
the
walls
of
the
valley
crackled
and
spat
sparks
abruptly
the
darkness
fell
as
abruptly
it
was
broken
again
by
a
similar
exhibition
only
this
time
the
fire
was
blue
blue
was
followed
by
purple
purple
by
red
then
ensued
the
briefest
possible
pause
in
which
a
figure
moved
across
the
bars
of
light
escaping
through
the
chinks
of
the
laboratory
and
then
the
whole
valley
blazed
with
patches
of
fire
it
was
not
a
reflection
it
was
actual
physical
conflagration
of
the
solid
rock
in
irregular
areas
some
of
the
fire
shapes
were
most
fantastic
and
with
the
unexpectedness
of
a
bursting
shell
the
surface
of
the
ground
before
our
feet
crackled
into
a
ghastly
blue
flame
the
nigger
uttered
a
cry
in
his
throat
and
disappeared
i
felt
a
sharp
breath
on
my
neck
an
ejaculation
of
surprise
at
my
very
ear
it
was
startling
enough
to
scare
the
soul
out
of
a
man
but
i
held
fast
and
was
just
about
to
step
forward
when
my
collar
was
twisted
tight
from
behind
i
raised
both
hands
felt
steel
and
knew
that
i
was
in
the
grasp
of
handy
solomon
claw
the
sailor
had
me
foul
i
did
my
best
to
twist
around
to
unbutton
the
collar
but
in
vain
i
felt
my
wind
leaving
me
the
ghastly
blue
light
was
shot
with
red
distinctly
i
heard
the
man
sharp
intaken
breath
as
some
new
phenomenon
met
his
eye
and
his
great
oath
as
he
swore
by
the
mother
of
god
he
cried
it
the
devil
then
i
was
jerked
off
my
feet
and
the
next
i
knew
i
was
lying
on
my
back
very
wet
on
the
beach
the
day
was
breaking
and
the
men
quite
sober
were
talking
vehemently
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
what
they
said
but
as
handy
solomon
and
the
nigger
were
the
centre
of
discussion
i
could
imagine
the
subject
i
felt
very
stiff
and
sore
and
hazy
in
my
mind
my
neck
was
lame
from
the
dragging
and
my
tongue
dry
from
the
choking
for
some
time
i
lay
in
a
watching
the
lilac
of
dawn
change
to
the
rose
of
sunrise
utterly
indifferent
to
everything
they
had
thrown
me
down
across
the
first
rise
of
the
little
sand
dunes
back
of
the
tide
sands
and
from
it
i
could
at
once
look
out
over
the
sea
full
of
the
restless
shadows
of
dawn
and
the
land
narrowing
to
the
mouth
of
the
arroyo
i
remember
wondering
whether
captain
selover
were
up
yet
then
with
a
sharp
stab
at
the
heart
i
remembered
the
thought
was
like
a
dash
of
cold
water
in
clearing
my
faculties
i
raised
my
head
seaward
a
white
gull
had
caught
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
beyond
the
cliffs
landward
i
saw
with
a
choke
in
my
throat
a
figure
emerging
from
the
arroyo
at
the
sight
i
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
move
but
with
the
effort
discovered
that
i
was
again
bound
my
stirring
thus
called
attention
before
i
could
look
away
he
had
followed
the
direction
of
my
gaze
the
discussion
instantly
ceased
they
waited
in
grim
silence
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
percy
darrow
carrying
some
sort
of
large
book
was
walking
rapidly
toward
us
perdosa
had
disappeared
thrackles
after
an
instant
came
and
sat
beside
me
and
clapped
his
big
hand
over
my
mouth
it
was
horrible
when
within
a
hundred
paces
or
so
i
could
see
that
darrow
laboured
under
some
great
excitement
his
usual
indifferent
saunter
had
as
i
have
indicated
given
way
to
a
firm
and
decided
step
his
ironical
eye
glistened
his
sallow
cheek
glowed
boys
he
shouted
cheerfully
the
time
up
we
succeeded
sail
just
as
soon
as
the
lord
let
us
get
ready
rustle
the
stuff
aboard
the
doctor
be
down
in
a
short
time
and
we
ought
to
be
loaded
by
night
handy
solomon
and
pulz
laid
hand
on
two
of
the
rifles
near
by
and
began
surreptitiously
to
fill
their
magazines
the
nigger
shook
his
knife
free
of
the
scabbard
and
sat
with
it
in
his
left
hand
concealed
by
his
body
i
could
feel
thrackles
muscles
stiffen
another
fifty
paces
and
it
would
be
no
longer
necessary
to
stop
my
mouth
the
thought
made
me
desperate
i
had
failed
as
a
leader
of
these
men
and
i
had
been
forced
to
stand
by
at
debauching
cruel
and
murderous
affairs
but
now
it
is
over
i
thank
heaven
the
reproach
can
not
be
made
against
me
that
at
any
time
i
counted
the
consequences
to
myself
thrackles
hand
lay
heavy
across
my
mouth
i
bit
it
to
the
bone
and
as
he
involuntarily
snatched
it
away
i
rolled
over
toward
the
sea
thus
for
an
instant
i
had
my
mouth
free
run
run
i
shouted
for
god
sake
thrackles
leaped
upon
me
and
struck
me
heavily
upon
the
mouth
then
sprang
for
a
rifle
i
managed
to
struggle
back
to
the
dune
whence
i
could
see
xv
five
hundred
yards
range
percy
darrow
with
the
keenness
that
always
characterised
his
mental
apprehension
had
understood
enough
of
my
strangled
cry
he
had
not
hesitated
nor
delayed
for
an
explanation
but
had
turned
track
and
was
now
running
as
fast
as
his
long
legs
would
carry
him
back
toward
the
opening
of
the
ravine
my
companions
stood
watching
him
but
making
no
attempt
either
to
shoot
or
to
follow
for
a
moment
i
could
not
understand
this
then
remembered
the
disappearance
of
perdosa
my
heart
jumped
wildly
for
the
mexican
had
been
gone
quite
long
enough
to
have
cut
off
the
assistant
escape
i
could
not
doubt
that
he
would
pick
off
his
man
at
close
range
as
soon
as
the
fugitive
should
have
reached
the
entrance
to
the
arroyo
there
can
be
no
question
that
he
would
have
done
so
had
not
his
mexican
impatience
betrayed
him
he
shot
too
soon
percy
darrow
stopped
in
his
tracks
although
we
heard
the
bullet
sing
by
us
for
an
instant
we
thought
he
was
hit
then
perdosa
fired
a
second
time
again
without
result
darrow
turned
sharp
to
the
left
and
began
desperately
to
scale
the
steep
cliffs
i
once
took
part
in
a
wild
boar
hunt
on
the
coast
of
california
our
dogs
had
penned
a
small
band
at
the
head
of
a
narrow
from
which
a
single
steep
trail
led
over
the
hill
we
perched
on
another
hill
some
three
or
four
hundred
yards
away
shot
at
the
animals
as
they
toiled
up
the
trail
the
range
was
long
but
we
had
time
for
the
severity
of
the
climb
forced
the
boars
to
a
foot
pace
it
was
exactly
like
that
percy
darrow
had
two
hundred
feet
of
ascent
to
make
he
could
go
just
so
fast
must
consume
just
so
much
time
in
his
progress
up
the
face
of
the
hill
during
that
time
he
furnished
an
excellent
target
and
the
loose
sandstone
showed
where
each
shot
struck
a
significant
indication
was
that
the
men
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
get
nearer
for
which
manoeuvre
they
would
have
had
time
in
plenty
but
distributed
themselves
leisurely
for
a
shooting
match
first
shot
claimed
handy
solomon
and
without
delay
fired
a
puff
of
dust
showed
to
the
right
nerve
no
good
he
commented
jerked
her
just
as
i
pulled
pulz
fired
from
the
knee
the
dust
this
time
puffed
below
thought
she
carry
up
at
that
distance
he
muttered
the
nigger
too
missed
and
thrackles
grinned
triumphantly
i
get
a
show
said
he
he
spread
his
massive
legs
apart
drew
a
deep
breath
and
raised
his
weapon
it
lay
in
his
grasp
steady
as
a
log
and
i
saw
that
percy
darrow
fate
was
in
the
hands
of
that
dangerous
class
of
natural
marksman
that
possesses
no
nerves
but
for
the
second
time
my
teeth
saved
his
life
the
trigger
guard
slipped
against
thrackles
lacerated
hand
almost
at
the
instant
of
discharge
he
missed
and
the
bullet
went
wide
darrow
had
climbed
a
matter
of
twenty
feet
now
the
seamen
distributed
themselves
for
more
leisurely
and
accurate
marksmanship
handy
solomon
lay
flat
on
his
stomach
resting
the
rifle
muzzle
across
the
top
of
a
sand
dune
pulz
sat
down
an
elbow
on
either
knee
for
the
greater
steadiness
the
nigger
knelt
but
thrackles
remained
on
his
feet
no
rest
could
be
steadier
than
the
rigidity
of
his
thick
arms
the
firing
now
became
miscellaneous
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
anyone
else
each
discovered
what
i
could
have
told
them
that
even
the
human
figure
at
five
hundred
yards
is
a
small
mark
for
a
strange
rifle
the
constant
correction
of
elevation
however
brought
the
puffs
of
dust
always
closer
and
i
could
not
but
realise
that
the
doctrine
of
chances
must
bring
home
some
of
the
bullets
i
soon
discovered
by
way
of
comfort
that
only
thrackles
and
handy
solomon
really
understood
firearms
and
of
those
two
thrackles
alone
had
had
much
experience
at
long
range
he
told
me
afterward
he
had
hunted
otter
about
halfway
up
the
cliff
thrackles
fired
his
fifth
shot
no
dust
followed
the
discharge
and
i
saw
percy
darrow
stagger
and
almost
lose
his
hold
the
men
yelled
savagely
but
the
assistant
pulled
himself
together
and
continued
his
crawling
the
sun
had
been
shining
in
our
faces
i
could
imagine
its
blurring
effect
on
the
sights
now
abruptly
it
was
blotted
out
and
a
fell
we
all
looked
up
in
spite
of
ourselves
an
opaque
veil
had
been
drawn
quite
across
the
heavens
through
which
we
could
not
make
out
even
the
shape
of
the
sun
it
was
like
a
thunder
cloud
except
that
its
under
surface
instead
of
being
the
usual
was
a
deep
as
we
looked
up
a
deep
bellow
stirred
the
air
which
had
fallen
quite
still
long
forks
of
lightning
shot
horizontally
from
the
direction
of
the
island
interior
and
flashes
of
dull
red
were
reflected
from
the
canopy
of
cloud
the
men
stared
with
their
mouths
open
undoubtedly
the
change
had
been
some
time
in
preparation
but
all
had
been
so
absorbed
in
the
affair
of
the
doctor
assistant
that
no
one
had
noticed
it
came
to
our
consciousness
with
the
suddenness
of
a
theatrical
change
a
dull
roaring
commenced
grew
in
volume
and
then
a
great
explosion
shook
the
very
ground
under
our
feet
we
stared
at
each
other
our
faces
whitening
what
kind
of
hell
has
broke
loose
muttered
pulz
the
nigger
fell
flat
on
his
face
uttering
deep
lamentations
voodoo
voodoo
he
groaned
a
gentle
shower
of
white
flakes
began
powdering
the
surface
of
everything
far
out
to
sea
we
could
make
out
the
sun
on
the
water
gradually
the
roaring
died
down
the
lightning
ceased
comparative
peace
ensued
we
looked
again
toward
the
cliff
percy
darrow
had
not
for
one
instant
ceased
to
climb
he
was
just
topping
the
edge
of
the
bluff
handy
solomon
with
a
cry
of
rage
seized
another
rifle
and
emptied
the
magazine
at
him
as
fast
as
the
lever
could
be
worked
the
dust
flew
wild
in
a
half
dozen
places
darrow
drew
himself
up
to
the
sky
line
raised
his
hat
ironically
and
disappeared
illustration
the
firing
now
became
miscellaneous
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
any
one
else
damn
his
soul
cried
handy
solomon
his
face
livid
he
threw
his
rifle
to
the
beach
and
danced
on
it
in
an
ecstasy
of
rage
what
do
we
care
growled
thrackles
he
no
good
to
us
i
want
to
know
is
wat
up
here
anyhow
did
you
never
see
a
volcano
go
off
you
swab
snapped
handy
solomon
easy
with
your
names
mate
no
i
never
did
we
better
get
out
without
the
chest
we
go
up
the
gulch
and
get
it
then
suggested
thrackles
but
at
this
handy
solomon
drew
back
in
evident
terror
up
that
hole
of
hell
he
objected
not
i
you
an
pulz
go
they
wrangled
over
it
pulz
joining
perdosa
shaken
to
the
soul
crept
in
and
made
a
for
the
rum
barrel
he
and
the
nigger
were
frankly
scared
they
had
the
nervous
jumps
at
every
little
noise
or
unexpected
movement
and
even
the
natural
explanation
of
these
phenomena
gave
them
very
little
reassurance
i
knew
that
darrow
would
hurry
as
fast
as
he
could
back
to
the
valley
by
way
of
the
upper
hills
i
knew
that
he
had
there
several
sporting
rifles
and
i
hoped
greatly
that
he
and
schermerhorn
might
accomplish
something
before
the
men
had
recovered
their
wits
to
the
point
of
foreseeing
his
probable
attack
the
uncanny
cloud
in
the
heavens
the
weird
and
the
explosions
which
now
grew
more
frequent
had
their
strong
effect
in
spite
of
explanation
the
men
were
not
really
afraid
to
venture
in
quest
of
the
supposed
treasure
but
they
were
in
a
frame
of
mind
that
dreaded
the
first
plunge
and
time
was
going
by
but
the
fates
were
against
us
as
always
in
this
voyage
i
watching
from
my
sand
dune
saw
a
second
figure
emerge
from
the
arroyo
mouth
it
appeared
to
stagger
as
though
hurt
and
every
eight
or
ten
paces
it
stopped
and
rested
in
a
position
the
murky
light
was
too
dim
for
me
to
make
out
details
but
after
a
moment
a
rift
in
the
veil
enabled
me
to
identify
schermerhorn
carrying
with
great
difficulty
the
chest
xvi
the
murder
i
took
no
chances
but
began
at
once
to
shout
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
men
had
noticed
his
coming
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
tell
whether
or
not
schermerhorn
heard
me
if
he
did
he
misunderstood
my
intention
for
he
continued
painfully
to
advance
the
only
result
i
gained
was
to
get
myself
well
gagged
with
my
own
pocket
handkerchief
and
thrown
in
a
hollow
between
the
dunes
thence
i
could
hear
handy
solomon
speaking
fiercely
and
rapidly
now
you
let
me
run
this
he
commanded
we
got
to
find
out
somethin
it
ai
no
good
to
us
without
we
knows
and
we
want
to
find
out
how
he
got
the
rest
hid
they
assented
i
goin
out
to
help
him
carry
her
in
announced
the
seaman
a
long
pause
ensued
in
which
i
watched
the
deep
canopy
of
thicken
overhead
a
strange
and
unearthly
light
had
fallen
on
the
world
and
the
air
was
quite
still
after
a
while
i
heard
handy
solomon
and
schermerhorn
join
the
group
there
you
are
perfessor
cried
handy
solomon
in
tones
of
the
greatest
heartiness
i
put
her
right
there
and
she
be
as
safe
as
a
babby
at
home
she
heavy
though
schermerhorn
laughed
a
pleased
and
excited
laugh
i
could
tell
by
the
tone
of
his
voice
that
he
was
strung
high
and
guessed
that
his
triumph
needed
an
audience
you
may
say
so
well
he
said
it
iss
heafy
and
it
iss
heafy
with
the
the
great
substance
than
can
do
efferything
where
iss
percy
he
gone
aboard
we
must
embark
the
time
is
joost
right
a
day
sooner
and
the
egsperiment
would
haf
been
spoilt
but
now
he
laughed
let
the
island
sink
we
do
not
care
we
must
embark
hastily
it
take
a
man
long
time
to
carry
down
all
your
things
perfessor
oh
led
them
go
the
eruption
has
alretty
swallowed
them
oop
the
lava
iss
by
now
a
foot
deep
in
the
valley
before
long
it
flows
here
so
we
must
embark
but
you
lost
all
them
vallyable
things
perfessor
said
handy
solomon
now
i
call
that
hard
luck
schermerhorn
snapped
his
fingers
they
do
not
amoundt
to
that
he
cried
here
here
in
this
leetle
box
iss
all
the
treasure
here
iss
the
labour
of
ten
years
here
iss
the
and
the
crew
and
all
the
equipmendt
comprised
here
iss
the
world
i
a
plain
seaman
perfessor
and
i
suppose
i
got
to
believe
you
but
she
a
main
small
box
for
all
that
with
that
small
box
you
can
haf
all
your
wishes
asserted
the
professor
still
in
the
german
lyric
strain
over
his
triumph
it
iss
the
box
of
enchantments
you
haf
but
to
will
the
change
you
would
haf
taig
place
it
iss
done
the
substance
of
the
rocks
the
molecule
all
could
a
man
make
diamonds
asked
pulz
abruptly
i
could
hear
the
sharp
intake
of
the
men
breathing
as
they
hung
on
the
reply
much
more
wonderful
changes
than
that
it
can
accomplish
replied
the
doctor
with
an
indulgent
laugh
that
change
iss
simple
carbon
iss
coal
carbon
iss
diamond
you
see
one
has
but
to
change
the
form
not
the
substance
then
it
change
coal
to
diamonds
asked
handy
solomon
yes
you
gather
my
meanings
i
heard
a
sharp
squeak
like
a
terrified
mouse
then
a
long
dreadful
silence
then
two
dull
heavy
blows
spaced
with
deliberation
a
moment
later
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
handy
solomon
bent
forward
to
the
labour
of
dragging
a
body
toward
the
sea
his
steel
claw
hooked
under
the
angle
of
the
jaw
as
a
man
handles
a
fish
pulz
came
and
threw
off
my
bonds
and
gag
come
along
said
he
all
kept
looking
fearfully
toward
the
arroyo
a
dense
white
steam
marked
its
course
the
air
was
now
heavy
with
portent
successive
explosions
some
light
some
severe
shook
the
foundations
of
the
island
great
rocks
and
boulders
bounded
down
the
hills
the
flashes
of
lightning
had
become
more
frequent
we
moved
exaggerated
to
each
other
vision
by
the
strange
light
uncouth
and
gigantic
let
get
out
of
this
cried
thrackles
we
turned
at
the
word
and
ran
thrackles
staggering
under
the
weight
of
the
chest
all
our
belongings
we
abandoned
and
set
out
for
the
with
only
the
tatters
in
which
we
stood
luckily
for
us
a
great
part
of
the
ship
stores
had
been
returned
to
her
hold
after
the
last
thorough
scrubbing
so
we
were
in
subsistence
but
all
our
clothes
all
our
personal
belongings
were
left
behind
us
on
the
beach
for
after
once
we
had
topped
the
cliff
that
led
over
to
the
cove
i
doubt
if
any
consideration
on
earth
would
have
induced
us
to
return
to
that
accursed
place
the
row
out
to
the
ship
was
wet
and
dangerous
seismic
disturbances
were
undoubtedly
responsible
for
high
pyramidic
waves
that
lifted
and
fell
without
onward
movement
we
fairly
tumbled
up
out
of
the
dory
which
we
did
not
hoist
on
deck
but
left
at
the
end
of
the
painter
to
beat
her
sides
against
the
ship
xvii
the
open
sea
our
haste
however
availed
us
little
for
there
was
no
wind
at
all
we
lay
for
over
two
hours
under
the
weird
light
by
the
brown
cloud
while
the
explosions
shook
the
foundations
of
the
world
nobody
ventured
below
the
sails
flapped
idly
from
the
masts
the
blocks
and
spars
creaked
the
waves
rose
straight
up
and
fell
again
as
though
reaching
from
the
deep
when
the
men
first
began
to
sweat
the
sails
up
evidently
in
preparation
for
an
immediate
departure
i
objected
vehemently
you
are
going
to
leave
him
on
the
island
i
cried
he
die
of
starvation
they
did
not
answer
me
but
after
a
little
more
when
my
expostulations
had
become
more
positive
handy
solomon
dropped
the
halliard
and
drew
me
to
one
side
look
here
you
he
snarled
you
better
just
stow
your
gab
lucky
to
be
here
yourself
let
alone
botherin
your
thick
head
about
anybody
else
and
you
can
kiss
the
book
on
that
do
you
know
why
you
with
them
carrion
he
jerked
his
thumb
toward
the
beach
it
because
solomon
anderson
your
friend
thrackles
would
have
killed
you
in
a
minute
of
his
bit
hand
i
got
you
your
chance
now
do
you
be
a
fool
for
i
ai
goin
to
stand
between
you
and
them
another
time
besides
he
wo
last
long
if
that
volcano
keeps
at
it
he
left
me
whatever
truth
lay
in
his
assumption
of
friendship
and
i
doubted
there
existed
much
of
either
truth
or
friendship
in
him
i
saw
the
common
sense
of
his
advice
i
was
in
no
position
to
dictate
a
course
of
action
after
the
sails
were
on
her
we
gathered
at
the
starboard
rail
to
watch
the
shore
there
the
hills
ran
into
inky
blackness
as
the
horizon
sometimes
merges
into
a
thunder
squall
a
dense
white
steam
came
from
the
creek
bed
within
the
arroyo
the
surges
beat
on
the
shore
louder
than
the
ordinary
and
the
foam
even
in
these
day
hours
seemed
to
throw
up
a
faint
phosphorescence
frequent
earthquakes
oscillated
the
landscape
we
watched
i
do
not
know
for
what
our
eyes
straining
into
the
murk
of
the
island
nobody
thought
of
the
chest
which
lay
on
the
cabin
table
aft
i
contributed
maliciously
my
bit
to
their
fear
these
volcanic
islands
sometimes
sink
entirely
i
suggested
and
in
that
case
we
be
carried
down
by
the
suction
it
was
intended
merely
to
increase
their
uneasiness
but
strangely
enough
after
a
few
moments
it
ended
by
imposing
itself
on
my
own
fears
i
began
to
be
afraid
the
island
would
sink
began
to
watch
for
it
began
to
share
the
fascinated
terror
of
these
men
the
suspense
after
a
time
became
unbearable
for
while
the
portent
whether
physical
or
moral
we
were
too
far
under
its
influence
to
distinguish
grew
momentarily
our
own
souls
did
not
expand
in
due
correspondence
we
talked
of
towing
of
kedging
out
of
going
to
any
extreme
even
to
small
boats
then
just
as
we
were
about
to
move
toward
some
accomplishment
a
new
phenomenon
chained
our
attention
to
the
shore
in
the
mouth
of
the
arroyo
appeared
a
red
glow
a
moment
later
a
wave
of
lava
red
iridescent
cooling
to
a
black
crust
cracked
in
incandescence
rolled
majestically
out
over
the
grassy
plain
each
instant
it
grew
in
volume
until
the
ravine
must
have
been
flowing
half
full
before
its
scorching
the
grasses
even
at
the
edge
of
the
sea
were
smoking
and
our
camp
had
already
burst
into
flames
we
had
to
shield
our
faces
against
the
heat
and
the
wooden
railing
under
our
hands
was
growing
warm
pulz
turned
an
ashy
countenance
toward
us
my
god
he
screamed
what
going
to
happen
when
she
hits
the
sea
she
hit
the
sea
and
immediately
a
great
cloud
of
steam
arose
and
the
hissing
as
of
a
thousand
serpents
we
felt
the
strong
suction
under
our
keel
and
staggered
under
the
jerk
of
the
ship
cable
as
she
swung
toward
the
beach
the
paint
was
beginning
to
crackle
along
the
rail
we
could
see
nothing
for
the
scalding
white
veil
that
enveloped
us
we
could
hear
nothing
for
the
roar
of
steam
the
bombardment
of
explosions
and
the
crash
of
thunder
but
our
nostrils
were
assaulted
by
a
most
unearthly
medley
of
smells
hell
loose
growled
thrackles
we
were
clinging
hard
as
the
ship
reeled
huge
surges
were
racing
in
from
seaward
growing
larger
with
each
successive
billow
handy
solomon
raised
his
head
listened
intently
and
struck
his
forehead
wind
he
screamed
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
jumped
for
the
halliards
thrackles
followed
him
but
no
one
else
moved
in
an
instant
the
two
were
back
striking
and
kicking
savagely
rousing
their
companions
to
the
danger
we
all
laid
into
the
canvas
like
mad
and
in
no
time
had
snugged
down
to
a
staysail
and
the
peak
of
our
mainsail
thrackles
drew
his
knife
and
jumped
for
the
cable
while
handy
solomon
his
eyes
snapping
seized
the
wheel
we
finished
just
in
time
i
was
turning
away
after
tying
the
last
gasket
on
the
foresail
when
the
deck
and
tipped
me
headforemost
into
the
starboard
scupper
at
the
same
time
a
smother
of
salt
water
blew
over
the
port
rail
now
far
above
me
to
drench
me
as
thoroughly
as
though
i
had
fallen
overboard
i
brushed
out
my
eyes
to
find
the
ship
smack
on
her
beam
ends
and
the
wind
howling
by
from
the
sea
i
had
company
enough
in
the
scuppers
only
handy
solomon
clung
desperately
to
the
wheel
jamming
his
weight
to
port
in
the
hope
she
might
pay
up
thrackles
too
his
eye
squinted
along
some
bearing
of
his
own
was
waiting
for
her
to
drag
presently
it
became
evident
that
she
was
doing
so
whereupon
he
drew
his
knife
across
our
hawser
my
god
chattered
pulz
at
my
ear
if
we
go
ashore
he
did
not
need
to
finish
unless
the
could
recover
before
the
squall
had
driven
her
to
leeward
a
scant
half
mile
we
should
be
cooked
alive
in
the
boiling
cauldron
at
the
shore
edge
for
an
interminable
time
as
it
seemed
to
me
we
lay
absolutely
motionless
the
scene
is
stamped
indelibly
on
my
memory
the
bulwarks
high
above
me
the
steep
sleek
deck
the
piratical
figure
tense
at
the
wheel
the
snarling
water
racing
from
beneath
us
the
lurid
glow
to
landward
crawling
up
on
us
inch
by
inch
like
a
hungry
wild
beast
then
almost
imperceptibly
the
brave
schooner
righted
the
strained
lines
on
handy
solomon
carven
features
relaxed
little
by
little
thrackles
staring
over
the
side
let
out
a
mighty
roar
steerage
way
he
shouted
and
executed
an
awkward
clog
dance
on
the
reeling
deck
she
moved
forward
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
for
gradually
we
were
eating
toward
the
wind
but
we
made
considerable
leeway
as
well
handy
solomon
taut
as
the
weather
rigging
took
his
little
advantages
one
by
one
like
precious
gifts
light
there
was
none
the
land
was
blotted
out
by
the
steam
and
murk
which
had
crept
to
sea
and
now
was
hurled
back
by
the
wind
all
we
could
do
was
to
hang
there
tasting
the
copper
of
excitement
waiting
for
these
different
forces
to
adjust
themselves
inch
by
inch
we
crept
forward
foot
by
foot
we
made
leeway
the
intensest
of
the
lava
glow
worked
its
way
from
directly
abeam
to
the
quarter
by
this
we
knew
we
must
be
nearly
opposite
the
cove
at
once
a
new
doubt
sprang
up
in
our
minds
a
moment
ago
all
the
energy
of
our
desires
had
gone
up
in
the
ambition
to
avoid
being
cast
on
the
beach
now
we
saw
that
that
was
not
enough
it
was
necessary
to
squeeze
around
the
point
where
lay
the
in
order
to
avoid
the
fate
that
had
overtaken
her
handy
solomon
yelled
something
at
us
we
could
not
hear
but
our
own
knowledge
told
us
what
it
must
be
and
with
one
accord
we
turned
to
on
the
foresail
with
the
peak
of
it
hoisted
we
moved
a
trifle
faster
though
the
schooner
lay
over
at
a
perilous
angle
a
moment
later
the
fogs
parted
to
show
us
the
cliffs
looming
startlingly
near
there
were
the
donkey
engine
and
the
works
we
had
constructed
for
wrecking
and
there
beside
them
watching
us
reflectively
stood
percy
darrow
for
ten
minutes
we
stared
at
him
fascinated
during
which
time
the
ship
laboured
against
the
staggering
winds
gained
and
lost
in
its
buffeting
with
the
great
surges
the
breakers
hurling
themselves
in
wild
abandon
against
the
rocks
sent
their
of
tumbling
peaks
to
our
very
bilges
the
few
remains
of
the
alternately
drenched
and
draining
seemed
to
picture
to
us
our
inevitable
end
i
think
we
had
all
selected
the
same
two
points
for
our
bearings
a
rock
and
a
drop
of
the
cliff
bolder
than
the
ordinary
if
the
rock
opened
from
the
cliff
to
eastward
we
were
lost
if
it
remained
stationary
we
were
at
least
holding
our
own
if
it
opened
out
to
westward
we
were
saved
we
watched
with
a
strained
eagerness
impossible
to
describe
at
each
momentary
gain
or
rebuff
we
uttered
ejaculations
the
nigger
mumbled
charms
every
once
in
a
while
one
of
us
would
snatch
a
glance
to
leeward
at
the
cruel
white
waters
the
whirl
of
eddies
where
the
sea
was
beaten
only
to
hurry
back
to
the
rock
and
the
point
of
the
cliff
whence
our
message
of
safety
or
destruction
was
to
be
flung
once
i
looked
up
percy
darrow
was
leaning
gracefully
against
a
stanchion
watching
his
soft
hat
was
pulled
over
his
eyes
he
stroked
softly
his
little
moustache
i
caught
the
white
puff
of
his
cigarette
during
the
moment
of
my
inattention
something
happened
a
wild
shout
burst
from
the
men
i
whirled
and
saw
to
my
great
joy
a
strip
of
sky
westward
between
the
cliff
and
the
rock
and
at
that
very
instant
a
billow
larger
than
the
ordinary
rolled
beneath
us
and
in
the
back
suction
of
its
passage
i
could
dimly
make
out
cruel
dangerous
rocks
lying
almost
under
our
keel
slowly
we
crept
away
our
progress
seemed
infinitesimal
and
yet
it
was
real
in
a
while
we
had
gained
sea
room
in
a
while
more
we
were
fairly
under
sailing
way
and
the
cliffs
had
begun
to
drop
from
our
quarter
with
one
accord
we
looked
back
percy
darrow
waved
his
hand
in
an
indescribably
graceful
and
ironic
gesture
then
turned
square
on
his
heel
and
sauntered
away
to
the
north
valley
out
of
the
course
of
the
lava
that
was
the
last
i
ever
saw
of
him
as
we
made
our
way
from
beneath
the
island
the
weight
of
the
wind
seemed
to
lessen
we
got
the
foresail
on
her
then
a
standing
jib
finally
little
by
little
all
her
ordinary
working
canvas
before
we
knew
it
we
were
bowling
along
under
a
stiff
breeze
and
the
island
was
dropping
astern
from
a
distance
it
presented
a
truly
imposing
sight
the
centre
shot
intermittent
blasts
of
ruddy
light
explosions
deadened
by
distance
still
reverberated
strongly
the
broad
canopy
of
split
with
lightnings
spread
out
like
a
huge
umbrella
the
lurid
gloom
that
had
enveloped
us
in
the
atmosphere
apparently
of
a
nether
world
had
given
place
to
a
twilight
abruptly
we
passed
from
it
to
a
sparkling
sea
the
breeze
blew
sweet
and
strong
the
waves
ran
untortured
in
their
natural
long
courses
at
once
the
men
seemed
to
throw
off
the
superstitious
terror
that
had
cowed
them
pulz
and
thrackles
went
to
bail
the
extra
dory
alongside
which
by
a
miracle
had
escaped
swamping
the
nigger
disappeared
in
the
galley
perdosa
relieved
handy
solomon
at
the
wheel
and
handy
solomon
came
directly
over
to
me
xviii
the
catastrophe
he
approached
me
with
a
confidence
that
proclaimed
the
new
leader
a
brace
of
colt
revolvers
swung
from
his
belt
the
tatters
of
his
garments
hung
about
him
well
here
we
are
he
remarked
i
nodded
waiting
for
what
he
had
to
disclose
and
lucky
for
you
that
you
here
at
all
say
i
he
continued
and
now
that
you
here
are
you
going
to
do
that
the
question
are
you
going
to
do
he
cocked
his
head
sidewise
and
looked
at
me
speculatively
as
a
cat
might
look
at
a
rather
large
mouse
we
been
a
little
rough
he
went
on
after
a
moment
and
some
folks
is
there
might
be
trouble
and
you
know
a
heap
too
much
what
do
you
want
of
me
i
demanded
it
just
this
he
returned
briskly
if
you
lay
us
our
course
to
san
salvador
we
let
you
go
as
one
of
us
and
no
questions
asked
if
not
i
inquired
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
leave
it
to
you
there
always
the
sea
i
suggested
and
it
deep
he
agreed
we
looked
out
to
the
horizon
in
a
diplomatic
silence
i
did
not
know
whether
to
be
angry
amused
or
alarmed
that
the
man
estimated
my
cleverness
so
slightly
why
the
hook
was
barely
concealed
and
the
bait
of
the
coarsest
that
i
would
go
safe
to
a
sight
of
san
salvador
i
did
not
doubt
that
i
would
never
enter
the
harbour
i
was
absolutely
certain
the
choice
offered
me
was
practically
whether
i
preferred
being
thrown
overboard
now
or
several
hundred
miles
to
southeastward
i
thought
rapidly
it
might
be
possible
to
announce
a
daily
false
reckoning
to
the
crew
to
sail
the
ship
within
rowing
distance
of
some
coast
and
then
to
escape
while
the
men
believed
themselves
many
hundred
miles
at
sea
it
would
take
nice
calculation
to
prevent
suspicion
but
as
it
was
the
only
chance
i
resolved
upon
it
immediately
that
all
very
well
i
said
firmly
but
you
ca
get
anywhere
without
me
and
i
not
going
to
put
in
two
years
and
then
keep
my
mouth
shut
for
nothing
i
want
a
share
in
the
swag
an
even
share
with
the
rest
of
you
oh
that
be
all
right
he
cried
you
can
have
it
if
anything
was
needed
to
convince
me
of
the
man
sinister
intentions
this
too
ready
acquiescence
would
have
been
enough
i
knew
him
too
well
if
he
had
had
the
slightest
intention
of
permitting
me
to
go
free
he
would
have
bargained
the
nigger
called
us
to
mess
we
ate
in
the
after
cabin
the
chest
was
locked
and
the
men
had
as
yet
been
unable
to
break
into
it
pulz
professed
some
skill
in
locksmithing
and
promised
to
experiment
later
after
mess
we
went
on
deck
again
the
island
had
dropped
down
to
the
horizon
and
showed
as
a
brilliant
glow
under
a
dark
canopy
i
leaned
over
the
rail
looking
at
it
below
me
the
extra
dory
bumped
along
the
idea
came
to
me
that
if
i
could
escape
that
night
i
could
row
back
to
percy
darrow
the
two
of
us
could
make
shift
to
live
on
fish
and
shellfish
and
mutton
the
plan
rapidly
defined
itself
in
my
brain
from
the
remains
of
the
we
could
construct
some
kind
of
a
craft
in
which
to
run
free
to
the
summer
trades
thus
we
might
in
time
reach
some
one
or
another
of
the
sandwich
islands
whence
a
passing
trader
could
take
us
back
to
civilisation
there
were
many
elements
of
uncertainty
in
the
scheme
but
it
seemed
to
me
less
desperate
than
trusting
to
the
caprices
of
these
men
especially
since
they
now
had
free
access
to
the
liquor
stores
while
i
leaned
over
the
rail
engrossed
in
these
thoughts
one
of
the
black
thunder
clouds
that
had
been
gathering
and
dissipating
over
the
island
during
the
entire
afternoon
suddenly
glowed
overhead
with
a
strange
white
incandescence
startlingly
akin
to
darrow
devil
fires
strangely
enough
this
illumination
unlike
the
volcanic
glows
appeared
to
be
cast
on
the
clouds
from
without
rather
than
shot
through
them
from
within
as
were
the
other
volcanic
emanations
at
the
same
instant
i
experienced
a
sharp
interior
revulsion
of
some
sort
most
briefly
momentary
but
of
a
character
that
shook
me
from
head
to
toe
i
had
no
time
to
analyse
these
various
impressions
however
for
my
attention
was
almost
instantly
distracted
from
the
cabin
came
the
sound
of
a
sharp
fall
then
a
man
cried
out
and
on
the
heels
of
it
pulz
darted
from
the
cabin
screaming
horribly
we
were
all
on
deck
and
as
the
little
man
rushed
toward
the
stern
handy
solomon
twisted
him
deftly
from
his
feet
my
god
mate
what
is
it
he
cried
as
he
pinned
the
sufferer
to
the
deck
but
pulz
could
not
answer
he
shivered
stiffened
and
lay
rigid
his
eyes
rolled
back
fits
remarked
thrackles
impatiently
the
excitement
died
rum
was
forced
between
the
victim
lips
after
a
little
he
recovered
but
could
tell
us
nothing
of
his
seizure
after
the
dishes
had
been
swept
aside
from
supper
handy
solomon
announced
a
second
attempt
to
open
the
chest
pancho
here
says
he
been
a
mechanic
said
he
i
right
well
know
he
been
a
housebreaker
so
he
got
the
for
the
job
and
you
can
kiss
the
book
on
that
perdosa
with
a
grin
leaned
over
the
cover
from
behind
and
began
to
pick
away
at
the
lock
with
a
long
crooked
wire
the
others
drew
close
about
i
slipped
nearer
the
door
imagining
that
in
their
riveted
interest
i
saw
my
opportunity
to
my
surprise
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
legs
disappearing
up
the
companion
i
took
stock
pulz
had
gone
on
deck
this
surprised
me
for
i
should
have
thought
every
man
interested
enough
in
the
supposed
treasure
to
wish
to
be
present
at
its
uncovering
and
it
annoyed
me
still
more
the
success
of
my
plan
demanded
a
clear
deck
however
there
was
nothing
for
it
now
but
to
trust
that
pulz
had
wished
to
visit
the
forecastle
and
that
i
might
find
the
afterworks
empty
i
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
companion
and
looked
back
a
breathlessness
of
excitement
held
the
pirates
in
a
vise
from
above
the
hanging
lamp
threw
strong
shadows
across
their
faces
bringing
out
the
deep
lines
accentuating
the
dominant
passions
with
their
rags
and
blood
their
unshaven
faces
their
firearms
their
filth
they
showed
in
violent
antithesis
to
the
immaculate
white
of
old
scrubs
cabin
its
glittering
brass
and
its
shining
leather
i
darted
up
the
steps
the
contrast
of
the
starry
night
with
the
glare
of
the
cabin
lamp
dazzled
my
eyes
i
stood
stock
still
for
a
moment
during
which
the
only
sounds
audible
were
the
singing
of
the
winds
through
the
rigging
the
wash
of
the
sea
and
the
small
sharp
click
of
perdosa
instrument
as
he
worked
at
the
chest
presently
i
could
see
better
i
looked
forward
and
aft
for
pulz
but
could
see
nothing
of
him
and
had
just
about
concluded
that
he
had
gone
forward
when
i
happened
to
glance
aloft
there
to
my
astonishment
i
made
him
out
huddled
in
silhouette
against
the
stars
close
to
the
main
truck
what
he
was
doing
there
i
could
not
imagine
however
i
did
not
have
time
to
bother
my
head
about
him
further
than
to
rejoice
that
he
could
not
obstruct
me
i
should
very
much
have
liked
to
get
hold
of
a
rifle
and
ammunition
or
at
least
to
lay
in
biscuit
and
water
but
for
this
there
was
no
time
it
was
not
absolutely
essential
the
dull
glow
of
the
island
was
still
visible
i
had
my
pillar
of
fire
and
smoke
to
guide
me
without
further
delay
i
jerked
loose
the
painter
and
drew
the
extra
dory
alongside
i
had
proceeded
just
so
far
in
my
movements
when
the
most
extraordinary
thing
happened
i
shall
try
to
tell
you
of
it
as
accurately
as
possible
and
in
the
exact
order
of
its
occurrence
first
a
long
straight
shaft
of
white
light
shot
straight
up
through
the
cabin
roof
to
a
great
height
it
shone
through
the
wooden
planks
as
an
ordinary
light
shines
through
glass
by
contrast
the
surrounding
blackness
was
thrown
into
a
deeper
shade
and
yet
the
shaft
itself
was
so
brilliant
as
almost
to
scotch
the
sight
curiously
enough
it
was
defined
accurately
being
exactly
in
shape
like
one
of
the
rectangular
tin
you
see
so
often
in
city
hotels
at
the
instant
of
its
appearance
the
wind
fell
quite
calm
almost
immediately
the
rectangle
on
the
roof
through
which
the
light
made
its
passage
began
to
splay
out
like
lighted
oil
although
the
column
retained
still
the
integrity
of
its
outline
the
fire
if
such
it
could
be
called
ran
with
incredible
rapidity
along
the
seams
between
the
planks
forward
and
aft
until
the
entire
deck
was
sketched
like
a
pyrotechnic
display
in
thin
vivid
lines
of
incandescence
from
each
of
these
lines
then
the
fire
began
again
to
spread
as
though
soaking
through
the
planks
all
took
place
practically
in
an
instant
of
time
i
had
no
opportunity
to
move
nor
to
cry
out
indeed
my
perceptions
were
inadequate
to
the
task
of
mere
observation
up
to
now
there
had
been
no
sound
the
wind
had
fallen
the
waters
passed
unnoticed
a
stillness
of
death
seemed
to
have
descended
on
the
ship
it
was
broken
by
a
sharp
double
report
one
as
of
the
fall
of
a
metallic
substance
the
other
caused
by
the
body
of
pulz
which
shaken
loose
from
the
truck
by
a
heavy
roll
smashed
against
the
rail
of
the
ship
and
splashed
overboard
someone
cried
out
sharply
an
instant
later
the
entire
crew
struggled
out
from
the
companionway
rushed
in
grim
silence
to
the
side
of
the
vessel
and
threw
themselves
into
the
sea
my
own
ideas
were
somewhat
confused
the
fire
had
practically
enveloped
the
ship
i
thought
to
feel
it
and
yet
my
skin
was
cool
to
the
touch
the
ship
outlines
became
blurred
a
dizziness
overtook
me
and
then
all
at
once
a
great
desire
seized
and
shook
my
very
soul
i
can
not
tell
you
the
vehemence
of
this
desire
it
was
a
madness
nothing
could
stand
in
the
way
of
its
gratification
whatever
happened
i
must
have
water
it
was
not
thirst
nor
yet
a
purpose
to
allay
the
very
real
physical
burning
of
which
i
was
now
dimly
conscious
but
a
craving
for
the
liquid
itself
as
something
apart
from
and
unconnected
with
anything
else
without
hesitation
and
as
though
it
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
i
vaulted
the
rail
to
cast
myself
into
the
ocean
i
dimly
remember
a
last
flying
impression
of
a
furnace
of
light
then
a
great
shock
thudded
through
me
and
i
lost
consciousness
part
three
the
maroon
i
in
the
wardroom
over
the
wardroom
of
the
had
fallen
a
silence
it
held
after
slade
had
finished
captain
parkinson
stiff
and
erect
in
his
chair
staring
fixedly
at
a
spot
two
feet
above
the
reporter
head
seemed
to
weigh
as
a
judge
weighs
the
facts
so
picturesquely
set
forth
trendon
his
sturdy
frame
half
in
shadow
had
slouched
far
down
into
himself
only
the
regard
of
his
keen
eyes
fixed
upon
slade
face
unwaveringly
and
a
bit
anxiously
showed
that
he
was
thinking
of
the
narrator
as
well
as
of
the
narrative
the
others
had
fallen
completely
under
the
spell
of
the
tale
they
sat
as
children
in
a
theatre
absorbed
forgetful
of
the
world
around
them
wrapped
in
a
more
vivid
element
at
the
close
they
stirred
and
blinked
half
dazed
by
the
abrupt
fall
of
the
curtain
slade
had
told
his
story
with
fire
with
something
of
passion
even
now
he
felt
the
sharp
reflex
he
muttered
uncertainly
beneath
his
breath
and
glanced
from
one
to
another
of
the
circled
faces
that
all
he
said
unsteadily
there
passed
through
the
group
a
stir
and
a
murmur
someone
broke
into
sharp
coughing
chairs
shoved
back
grated
on
the
floor
well
of
all
the
extraordinary
began
a
voice
ruminatingly
and
broke
short
off
as
if
abashed
at
its
own
infraction
of
the
silence
that
all
repeated
slade
a
note
of
insistence
in
his
voice
why
do
you
say
something
confound
you
why
do
you
say
something
his
speech
rose
husky
and
cracked
do
you
believe
it
hold
on
said
the
surgeon
quietly
no
need
to
get
excited
oh
well
muttered
the
reporter
with
a
sudden
lapse
possibly
you
think
i
romancing
it
does
matter
i
do
suppose
i
believe
it
myself
in
your
place
but
we
heading
for
the
island
suggested
forsythe
that
so
cried
slade
well
that
all
right
believe
or
disbelieve
as
much
as
you
like
only
get
percy
darrow
off
that
island
then
have
his
version
there
are
a
few
things
i
want
to
find
out
about
myself
there
are
several
that
promise
to
be
fairly
interesting
said
forsythe
under
his
breath
slade
turned
to
the
captain
have
you
any
questions
to
put
to
me
sir
he
asked
formally
just
one
moment
interrupted
trendon
boy
a
pony
of
brandy
for
mr
slade
the
reporter
drank
the
liquor
and
again
turned
to
captain
parkinson
only
about
our
men
said
the
commanding
officer
after
a
little
thought
slade
shook
his
head
i
sorry
i
ca
help
you
there
sir
trendon
said
that
you
knew
nothing
about
edwards
edwards
repeated
slade
inquiringly
his
mind
still
absorbed
in
the
events
which
he
had
been
relating
groped
backward
trendon
came
to
his
aid
barnett
asked
you
about
him
you
remember
it
was
when
you
recovered
consciousness
our
ensign
took
over
charge
of
the
oh
of
course
i
was
a
little
dazed
i
fancy
we
put
edwards
aboard
when
we
first
picked
up
the
deserted
schooner
explained
the
captain
pardon
me
said
the
other
my
head
does
seem
to
work
quite
right
yet
just
a
moment
please
he
sat
silent
with
closed
eyes
you
say
you
picked
up
the
when
he
asked
presently
four
five
six
days
ago
the
first
time
then
you
put
out
the
fire
the
circle
closed
in
on
slade
with
an
unconscious
hitching
forward
of
chairs
he
had
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
captain
his
mouth
worked
obviously
he
was
under
a
tensity
of
endeavour
in
keeping
his
faculties
set
to
the
problem
the
surgeon
watched
him
frowning
there
was
no
fire
said
the
captain
slade
leaped
in
his
chair
no
fire
but
i
saw
her
i
tell
you
when
i
went
overboard
she
was
one
living
flame
you
landed
in
the
small
boat
knocked
you
senseless
said
trendon
concussion
of
the
brain
idea
of
flame
might
have
been
a
retroactive
hallucination
retroactive
rot
cried
the
other
i
beg
your
pardon
trendon
but
if
you
seen
her
as
i
saw
her
barnett
he
turned
in
appeal
to
his
old
acquaintance
there
was
no
fire
slade
replied
the
executive
officer
gently
no
sign
of
fire
that
we
could
find
except
that
the
starboard
rail
was
blistered
oh
that
was
from
the
volcano
said
slade
that
was
nothing
it
was
all
there
was
returned
barnett
just
let
me
run
this
thing
over
said
the
free
lance
slowly
you
found
the
schooner
she
was
afire
she
did
even
seem
to
have
been
afire
you
put
a
crew
aboard
under
your
ensign
edwards
storm
separated
you
from
her
you
picked
her
up
again
deserted
is
that
right
day
before
yesterday
morning
then
cried
the
other
excitedly
the
fire
was
smouldering
all
the
time
it
broke
out
and
your
men
took
to
the
water
impossible
said
barnett
fiddlesticks
said
the
more
downright
surgeon
i
hardly
think
edwards
would
be
driven
overboard
by
a
fire
which
did
not
even
scorch
his
ship
suggested
the
captain
mildly
it
drove
our
lot
overboard
insisted
slade
do
you
think
we
were
a
pack
of
cowards
i
tell
you
when
that
hellish
thing
broke
loose
you
had
to
go
it
was
fear
it
was
pain
it
was
what
the
use
you
explain
a
thing
like
that
we
certainly
saw
the
glow
the
night
billy
edwards
was
disappeared
mused
forsythe
and
again
night
before
last
said
the
captain
what
that
cried
slade
where
is
the
i
give
something
pretty
to
know
said
barnett
is
she
in
tow
in
tow
said
forsythe
no
indeed
we
had
adequate
facilities
for
towing
her
did
you
tell
him
mr
barnett
where
is
she
then
slade
fired
the
question
at
them
like
a
examiner
why
we
shipped
another
crew
under
ives
and
mcguire
that
noon
we
were
parted
again
and
have
seen
them
since
god
forgive
you
said
the
reporter
after
the
warnings
you
had
too
it
was
it
was
my
orders
slade
said
captain
parkinson
with
quiet
dignity
of
course
sir
i
beg
your
pardon
returned
the
other
but
you
say
you
saw
the
light
again
the
first
night
they
were
out
said
barnett
in
a
low
voice
then
your
second
crew
is
with
your
first
crew
said
slade
shakily
and
they
with
thrackles
and
pulz
and
solomon
and
many
another
hearted
scoundrel
and
brave
seaman
down
there
he
pointed
under
foot
captain
parkinson
rose
and
went
to
his
cabin
slade
rose
too
but
his
knees
were
unsteady
he
tottered
and
but
for
the
swift
aid
of
barnett
arm
would
have
fallen
overdone
said
trendon
with
some
irritation
cost
you
something
in
strength
foolish
performance
turn
in
now
slade
tried
to
protest
but
the
surgeon
would
not
hear
of
it
and
marched
him
incontinently
to
his
berth
returning
trendon
reported
with
growls
of
discontent
that
his
patient
was
in
a
fever
could
expect
anything
else
he
fumed
pack
of
human
interrogation
points
hounding
him
all
over
the
place
what
do
you
think
of
his
story
asked
forsythe
the
grizzled
surgeon
drew
out
a
cigar
lighted
it
took
three
deliberate
puffs
turned
it
about
examined
the
ash
end
with
concentration
and
replied
man
telling
a
straight
story
you
think
it
all
true
cried
forsythe
humph
grunted
the
other
thinks
it
all
an
orderly
appeared
and
knocked
at
the
captain
cabin
beg
pardon
sir
they
heard
him
say
carter
would
like
to
know
how
close
in
to
run
volcano
acting
up
pretty
bad
sir
captain
parkinson
went
on
deck
followed
by
the
rest
ii
the
jolly
roger
feeling
the
way
forward
the
cruiser
was
soon
caught
in
a
maze
of
cross
currents
hither
and
thither
she
was
borne
a
creature
bereft
of
volition
order
followed
order
like
the
rattle
of
and
was
obeyed
with
something
more
than
the
customary
smartness
from
the
bridge
captain
parkinson
himself
directed
his
ship
his
face
was
placid
his
bearing
steady
and
confident
this
in
itself
was
sufficient
earnest
that
the
cruiser
was
in
ticklish
case
for
it
was
an
axiom
of
the
men
who
sailed
under
parkinson
that
the
calmer
that
nervous
man
grew
the
more
cause
was
there
for
nervousness
on
the
part
of
others
the
approach
was
from
the
south
but
suspicious
aspects
of
the
water
had
fended
the
cruiser
out
and
around
until
now
she
stood
to
a
bold
headland
at
the
northwest
corner
of
the
island
above
this
headland
lay
a
dark
pall
of
vapour
in
the
shifting
breeze
it
swayed
sluggishly
heavily
as
if
riding
at
anchor
like
a
logy
ship
of
the
air
only
once
did
it
show
any
marked
movement
it
spreading
out
toward
us
said
barnett
to
his
fellow
officers
gathered
aft
time
to
move
then
grunted
trendon
the
others
looked
at
him
inquiringly
about
as
healthful
as
prussic
acid
those
volcanic
gases
explained
the
surgeon
the
ship
edged
on
and
inward
presently
the
of
the
leadsman
sounded
in
measured
distinctness
through
the
silence
then
a
sudden
activity
and
bustle
forward
the
rattle
of
chains
and
the
was
at
anchor
the
captain
came
down
from
the
bridge
what
do
you
think
dr
trendon
he
asked
more
explicit
inquiry
was
not
necessary
the
surgeon
understood
what
was
in
his
superior
mind
never
can
tell
about
volcanoes
sir
he
said
of
course
agreed
the
captain
but
well
do
you
recognise
any
of
the
symptoms
want
me
to
diagnose
a
case
of
earthquake
sir
grinned
trendon
she
might
go
off
or
she
might
behave
herself
for
a
century
well
it
all
chance
said
the
other
cheerfully
the
man
be
alive
at
any
rate
we
must
do
our
best
on
that
theory
what
do
you
make
of
that
cloud
on
the
peak
poisonous
vapours
i
suppose
thought
we
have
a
chance
to
make
sure
just
now
seemed
to
be
coming
right
for
us
wind
shifted
it
since
there
could
be
anything
alive
up
there
not
so
much
as
a
bug
replied
the
doctor
positively
yet
i
thought
when
the
vapour
lifted
a
bit
that
i
saw
something
moving
when
was
that
sir
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
back
we
see
soon
enough
sir
put
in
forsythe
the
wind
is
driving
it
down
to
the
sullenly
reluctantly
the
forbidding
mass
moved
across
the
headland
all
glasses
were
bent
upon
it
without
taking
his
binocular
from
his
eyes
trendon
began
to
ruminate
aloud
if
he
could
have
got
to
the
beach
no
vapour
there
signal
though
perhaps
he
had
time
and
i
hate
to
risk
good
men
on
that
hell
cauldron
just
as
much
risk
here
perhaps
only
it
seems
there
it
is
cried
forsythe
look
the
highest
point
dull
gray
wisps
of
murk
the
afterguard
of
the
gaseous
cloud
were
twisting
and
spiraling
in
a
across
the
landscape
and
seen
by
snatches
and
glimpses
through
it
something
flapped
darkly
in
the
breeze
suddenly
the
veil
parted
and
fled
a
flag
stood
forth
in
the
sharp
gust
rigid
and
appalling
it
was
black
the
jolly
roger
by
god
they
come
back
exclaimed
forsythe
and
set
up
the
sign
of
their
shop
added
barnett
if
they
stuck
to
their
flag
observed
trendon
grimly
trendon
said
captain
parkinson
you
will
arm
yourself
and
go
with
me
in
the
gig
to
make
a
landing
yes
sir
responded
the
surgeon
mr
barnett
yes
sir
should
we
be
overtaken
by
the
vapour
while
on
the
highland
and
be
unable
to
get
back
to
the
beach
you
are
to
send
no
rescuing
party
up
there
until
the
air
has
cleared
but
sir
may
we
not
do
you
understand
yes
sir
in
case
of
an
attack
you
will
at
once
send
in
another
boat
with
a
howitzer
yes
sir
trendon
will
you
see
slade
and
inquire
of
him
the
best
point
for
landing
trendon
hesitated
i
suppose
it
would
hardly
do
to
take
him
with
us
pursued
the
commanding
officer
if
he
is
roused
now
even
for
a
moment
i
wo
answer
for
the
consequences
sir
said
the
surgeon
bluntly
surely
you
can
have
him
point
out
a
landing
place
said
the
captain
on
your
responsibility
returned
the
other
obstinately
he
under
opiate
now
be
it
so
said
captain
parkinson
after
a
time
going
in
they
saw
no
sign
of
life
along
the
shore
even
the
birds
had
deserted
it
for
the
time
the
volcano
seemed
to
have
pretermitted
its
activity
now
and
again
there
was
a
spurtle
of
smoke
from
the
cone
followed
by
subterranean
growlings
but
on
the
whole
the
conditions
were
reassuring
of
a
volcano
anyhow
remarked
trendon
disparagingly
real
eruption
would
have
wiped
the
whole
thing
off
the
map
first
whack
as
they
drew
in
it
became
apparent
that
they
must
scale
the
cliff
from
the
boat
farther
to
the
south
opened
out
a
wide
cove
that
suggested
easy
beaching
but
over
it
hung
a
cloud
of
steam
lava
pouring
down
said
trendon
fortunately
at
the
point
where
the
cliff
looked
easiest
the
seas
ran
low
ropes
had
been
brought
after
some
dainty
manoeuvring
two
of
the
sailors
gained
foothold
and
slung
the
ropes
so
that
the
remainder
of
the
disembarcation
was
simple
nor
was
the
ascent
of
the
cliff
a
harsh
task
half
an
hour
after
the
landing
the
exploring
party
stood
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
where
the
black
flag
waved
over
a
scene
of
utter
desolation
the
vegetation
was
withered
to
pallid
rags
even
the
tiniest
weedling
in
the
rock
crevices
had
been
poisoned
by
the
devastating
blast
in
the
midst
of
that
deathly
scene
the
flag
seemed
instinct
with
a
sinister
liveliness
whoever
had
set
it
there
had
accurately
chosen
the
highest
available
point
on
that
side
of
the
island
the
spot
of
all
others
where
it
would
make
good
its
signal
to
the
eye
of
any
chance
farer
upon
those
shipless
seas
for
the
staff
a
sapling
finely
polished
served
a
mound
of
supported
it
firmly
upon
the
cloth
itself
was
no
design
it
was
of
a
dull
black
the
hue
of
soot
captain
parkinson
standing
a
few
yards
off
viewed
it
with
disfavour
furl
that
flag
he
ordered
congdon
the
coxswain
of
the
gig
stepped
forward
and
began
to
work
at
the
fastenings
presently
he
turned
a
grinning
face
to
the
captain
who
was
scanning
the
landscape
through

he
said
well
what
is
it
demanded
captain
parkinson
beggin
your
pardon
sir
that
ai
rightly
no

that
what
you
might
rightly
call
a
garment
sir
it
an

beggin
your

black
undershirt
a
new
one
to
me
muttered
trendon
no
sir
it
ai
rightly
black
look
wrenching
the
object
from
its
fastenings
he
flapped
it
violently
a
cloud
of
sooty
dust
beaten
out
spread
about
his
face
with
a
strangled
cry
the
sailor
cast
the
shirt
from
him
and
rolled
in
agony
upon
the
ground
you
fool
cried
trendon
stand
back
all
of
you
opening
his
medicine
case
he
bent
over
the
racked
sufferer
presently
the
man
sat
up
pale
and
abashed
that
how
poisonous
volcanic
gas
is
said
the
surgeon
to
his
commanding
officer
only
inhaled
remnants
of
the
dust
too
an
ill
outlook
for
the
man
we
seeking
the
captain
mused
dead
if
he
anywhere
on
this
highland
declared
trendon
let
look
at
his
he
examined
the
staff
came
from
the
beach
he
pronounced
waterworn
h
maybe
he
ai
so
dead
either
i
do
quite
follow
you
dr
trendon
why
i
guess
our
man
has
figured
this
thing
all
out
brought
this
pole
up
from
the
beach
to
plant
it
here
why
because
this
was
the
best
observation
point
no
good
as
a
permanent
residence
though
planted
his
flag
and
went
back
why
did
we
see
him
on
the
beach
then
did
you
notice
a
cave
around
to
the
north
good
refuge
in
case
of
fumes
it
worth
trying
said
the
captain
putting
up
his
glass
hold
on
sir
what
this
here
something
look
here
trendon
pointed
to
a
small
bit
of
wood
rather
neatly
carved
to
the
shape
of
an
indicatory
finger
and
lashed
to
the
staff
at
the
height
of
a
face
the
others
clustered
around
oh
the
devil
cried
trendon
it
must
have
got
twisted
it
pointing
straight
down
strange
performance
said
the
captain
however
since
it
points
that
way
heave
aside
those
rocks
men
the
first
slab
lifted
brought
to
light
a
corner
of
cardboard
this
on
closer
examination
proved
to
be
the
cover
of
a
book
the
rocks
rolled
right
and
left
and
as
the
deprived
of
its
support
tottered
and
fell
the
trove
was
dragged
forth
and
handed
to
the
captain
while
the
ground
jarred
with
occasional
tremors
and
the
mountain
puffed
forth
its
vaporous
threats
he
and
the
surgeon
seated
on
a
rock
gave
themselves
with
complete
absorption
to
the
reading
iii
the
cache
outwardly
the
book
accorded
ill
with
its
surroundings
in
that
place
of
desolation

death
it
typified

it
should
have
been
found
on
a
desk
with

and
other
paraphernalia
forming
exact
angles
or
parallels
to
it
it
was
a
quarto
bound
in
marbled
paper
with
black
leather
over
the
hinges
no
external
label
suggested
its
ownership
or
uses
but
through
one
corner
blackened
and
formidable
in
its
contrast
to
the
peaceful
purposes
of
the
volume
a

been
bored
the

of

was
obvious
a

trendon
as
the

turned
the

about
slowly
in

and

he
whirled
the

over
to
the

glanced
at

to

there
sprawled
in
tremulous

for

the

handed
the

back
to
the

who
took
one
quick
look
closed
it
and
handed
it
to

up
and
carry

carefully
he
said

aye

said
the
coxswain
swathing

in

tucking
it
under

now
to
find
that
cave
said
captain
parkinson
to
the
surgeon
the
cave
in
the
cliff
of

said
trendon
noticed
it
coming
in
you
know
where
on
the
north
shore
about
a
mile
to
the
east
of
here
then
we
cut
directly
across
beg
your
pardon
sir
put
in
congdon
but
i
do
think
we
can
make
it
from
this
side
sir
why
not
no
beach
sir
and
the
cliff
like
the
side
of
a
ship
looks
to
be
deep
water
right
into
the
cave
mouth
back
to
the
boat
then
bring
that
flag
along
the
descent
was
swift
at
times
reckless
but
the
party
embarked
without
accident
soon
they
were
forging
through
the
water
at
racing
speed
the
boat
leaping
to
the
impulsion
of
the
sailorman
strongest
motives
curiosity
and
the
hope
of
saving
a
life
iv
the
twin
slabs
within
half
an
hour
the
gig
had
reached
the
mouth
of
the
cave
as
the
coxswain
had
predicted
the
seas
ran
into
the
lofty
entrance
elsewhere
the
surf
fell
whitely
but
through
the
arch
the
waves
rolled
unbroken
into
a
heavy
stillness
only
as
the
boat
hovered
for
a
moment
at
the
face
of
the
cliff
could
the
exploring
party
hear
far
within
the
hollow
boom
that
told
of
breakers
on
a
distant
subterranean
beach
run
her
in
easy
came
the
captain
order
keep
a
sharp
lookout
for
hidden
rocks
to
the
whispering
plash
of
the
oars
they
moved
from
sunlight
into
twilight
from
twilight
into
darkness
of
a
sudden
the
oars
jerked
convulsively
a
great
roar
had
broken
upon
the
ears
of
the
sailors
the
invisible
roof
above
them
the
water
heaving
beneath
them
the
walls
that
hemmed
them
in
called
with
a
multiplication
of
resonance
upon
the
name
of
darrow
the
boat
quivered
with
the
start
of
its
occupants
then
one
or
two
laughed
weakly
as
they
realised
that
what
they
had
heard
was
no
supernatural
voice
it
was
the
captain
hailing
for
the
marooned
man
no
vocal
answer
came
but
an
indeterminable
space
away
they
could
hear
a
low
splash
followed
by
a
second
and
a
third
something
coughed
weakly
in
front
and
to
the
right
trendon
hand
went
to
his
revolver
the
men
sat
stiffened
one
of
them
swore
in
a
whisper
and
the
oath
came
back
upon
them
echoing
the
name
of
the
saviour
in
hideous
sibilance
silence
in
the
boat
said
the
captain
in
such
buoyant
tones
that
the
men
braced
themselves
against
the
expected
peril
light
the
lantern
and
pass
it
to
me
came
the
order
keep
below
the
gunwale
men
as
the
match
spluttered
do
you
see
something
a
few
rods
to
port
asked
the
captain
in
trendon
ear
pair
of
green
lights
said
trendon
eyes
seals
shouted
the
walls
for
the
surgeon
had
suddenly
released
his
voice
and
as
the
mockery
boomed
the
green
lights
disappeared
and
there
was
more
splashing
from
the
distance
the
crew
sat
up
again
the
lantern
spread
its
radiance
it
was
reflected
from
battlements
of
fairy
beauty
everywhere
the
walls
were
set
as
with
gems
in
broad
wales
of
varied
and
vivid
hues
dazzled
at
first
the
explorers
soon
were
able
to
discern
the
general
nature
of
the
subterranean
world
which
they
had
entered
in
most
places
the
walls
rose
sheer
and
unscaleable
from
the
water
in
others
turretted
rocks
thrust
their
gleaming
crags
upward
over
to
starboard
a
little
beach
shone
with
quaker
greyness
in
that
spectacular
display
the
end
of
the
cavern
was
still
beyond
the
area
of
light
must
have
been
a
swimmer
to
get
in
here
commented
trendon
glancing
at
the
walls
unless
he
had
a
boat
said
the
captain
but
why
does
he
answer
better
try
again
no
telling
how
much
more
there
is
of
this
the
surgeon
raised
his
ponderous
bellow
and
the
cave
roared
again
with
the
summons
silence
formidable
and
unbroken
succeeded
house
to
house
search
is
now
in
order
he
said
must
be
in
here
somewhere
unless
the
seals
got
him
cautiously
the
boat
moved
forward
once
she
grazed
on
a
half
submerged
rock
again
a
tiny
islet
loomed
before
her
scattered
bones
glistened
on
the
rocky
shore
but
they
were
not
human
relics
occasional
beaches
tempted
a
landing
but
all
of
these
led
back
to
precipitous
cliffs
except
one
from
the
side
of
which
opened
two
small
caves
into
the
first
the
lantern
cast
its
glare
revealing
emptiness
for
the
arch
was
wide
and
the
cave
shallow
the
entrance
to
the
other
was
so
narrow
as
to
send
a
visitor
to
his
knees
but
inside
it
seemed
to
open
out
moreover
there
were
fish
bones
at
the
entrance
the
captain
the
surgeon
and
congdon
the
coxswain
landed
captain
parkinson
reached
the
spot
first
stooping
he
thrust
his
head
in
at
the
orifice
a
sharp
exclamation
broke
from
him
he
rose
to
his
feet
turning
a
contorted
face
to
the
others
poisonous
he
cried
more
volcano
said
trendon
he
bent
to
the
black
hole
and
sniffed
cautiously
i
go
in
sir
volunteered
congdon
i
had
my
business
said
trendon
briefly
decomposition
unpleasant
but
not
dangerous
pushing
the
lantern
before
him
he
wormed
his
way
until
the
light
was
blotted
out
presently
it
shone
forth
from
the
funnel
showing
that
the
explorer
had
reached
the
inner
open
space
captain
parkinson
dropped
down
and
peered
in
but
the
evil
odour
was
too
much
for
him
he
retired
gagging
and
coughing
trendon
was
gone
for
what
seemed
an
interminable
time
his
superior
officer
fidgeted
uneasily
at
last
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
trendon
are
you
all
right
he
shouted
yup
answered
a
choked
voice
cubbing
oud
dow
again
the
funnel
was
darkened
a
pair
of
feet
appeared
then
the
chunky
trunk
his
head
and
the
lantern
once
twice
and
thrice
he
inhaled
deeply
phew
he
gasped
thought
i
was
tough
but
did
you
find
no
sir
not
darrow
only
a
poor
devil
of
a
seal
that
crawled
in
there
to
die
the
exploration
continued
half
a
mile
as
they
estimated
from
the
open
they
reached
a
narrow
beach
shut
off
by
a
perpendicular
wall
of
rock
skirting
this
they
returned
on
the
other
side
minutely
examining
every
possible
crevice
when
they
again
reached
the
light
of
day
they
had
arrived
at
the
certain
conclusion
that
no
living
man
was
within
those
walls
would
a
corpse
rise
to
the
surface
soon
in
waters
such
as
these
dr
trendon
asked
the
captain
might
sir
might
not
no
telling
that
the
captain
ruminated
then
he
beat
his
fist
on
his
knee
the
other
cave
what
other
cave
asked
the
surgeon
the
cave
where
they
killed
the
seals
surely
exclaimed
trendon
wait
though
did
slade
say
it
was
between
here
and
the
point
yes
beyond
the
small
beach
no
cave
there
declared
the
surgeon
positively
there
must
be
congdon
did
you
see
an
opening
anywhere
in
the
cliff
as
we
came
along
no
sir
this
is
the
only
one
sir
we
see
about
that
said
the
captain
grimly
head
her
about
skirt
the
shore
as
near
the
breakers
as
you
safely
can
the
gig
retraced
its
journey
there
the
beach
as
slade
described
it
said
captain
parkinson
as
they
came
abreast
of
the
little
reach
of
sand
and
what
are
those
two
on
it
asked
trendon
see
dead
against
that
patch
of
bits
of
wreckage
fixed
in
the
sand
do
think
so
sir
too
well
matched
we
have
no
time
to
settle
the
matter
now
said
the
captain
impatiently
we
must
find
that
cave
if
it
is
to
be
found
hovering
just
outside
the
final
drag
of
the
surf
under
the
skilful
guidance
of
congdon
the
boat
moved
slowly
along
the
line
of
beach
to
the
line
of
cliff
all
was
open
as
the
day
the
blazing
sun
picked
out
each
detail
of
jut
and
hollow
evidently
the
poisonous
vapours
from
the
volcano
had
not
spread
their
blight
here
for
the
face
of
the
precipice
was
bright
with
many
flowers
so
close
in
moved
the
boat
that
its
occupants
could
even
see
butterflies
fluttering
above
the
bloom
but
that
which
their
eager
eyes
sought
was
still
denied
them
no
opening
offered
in
that
smiling
not
by
so
much
as
would
admit
a
terrier
did
the
mass
of
rock
and
rubble
gape
and
slade
described
the
cave
as
big
enough
to
ram
the
into
muttered
trendon
up
to
the
point
of
the
headland
and
back
passed
the
boat
blank
disappointment
was
the
result
what
is
your
opinion
now
dr
trendon
asked
the
captain
of
the
older
man
do
know
sir
answered
the
surgeon
hopelessly
looks
as
if
the
cave
might
have
been
a
hallucination
i
shall
have
something
to
say
to
slade
on
our
return
said
the
captain
crisply
if
the
cave
was
an
hallucination
as
you
suggest
the
was
fiction
looks
so
agreed
the
other
and
the
murder
of
the
captain
how
about
that
and
the
mutiny
of
the
men
added
the
surgeon
and
the
killing
of
the
doctor
your
patient
seems
to
be
a
romantic
genius
and
the
escape
of
darrow
hold
hard
quoth
trendon
darrow
no
romance
nothing
fictional
about
the
flag
and
ledger
true
enough
said
the
captain
and
fell
to
consideration
anyway
said
trendon
vigorously
i
like
to
have
a
look
at
those
roosts
mighty
like
signposts
to
my
mind
very
well
said
the
captain
it
cost
us
only
a
wetting
run
her
in
congdon
with
all
the
coxswain
skill
and
the
oarsmen
technique
the
passage
of
the
surf
was
a
lively
one
and
little
driblets
of
water
marked
the
trail
of
the
officers
as
they
shuffled
up
the
beach
the
two
slabs
stood
less
than
fifty
yards
beyond
high
water
tide
nearing
them
the
visitors
saw
that
each
marked
a
mound
but
not
until
they
were
close
up
could
they
read
the
neat
carving
on
the
first
it
ran
as
follows
solomon
anderson
handy
solomon
murdered
his
employer
his
captain
and
his
shipmates
and
was
found
dead
of
his
deserts
on
these
shores
june
this
slab
is
erected
as
a
memento
of
admiring
esteem
by
the
last
of
his
victims
and
you
can
kiss
the
book
on
that
percy
darrow
said
the
surgeon
you
can
kiss
the
book
on
too
then
slade
was
telling
the
truth
apparently
seems
good
corroboration
the
captain
turned
to
the
other
mound
its
slab
was
carved
by
the
same
hand
to
the
memory
of
an
ensign
of
the
navy
whose
body
washed
upon
this
coast
is
here
buried
with
all
reverence
by
strange
hands
whose
soul
may
god
rest
the
seas
shall
sing
his
requiem
june
the
sixth
billy
edwards
said
the
captain
very
low
he
uncovered
the
surgeon
did
likewise
so
for
a
space
they
stood
with
bared
heads
between
the
twin
graves
v
the
pinwheel
volcano
the
surgeon
spoke
first
another
point
said
he
darrow
was
alive
within
a
few
days
captain
parkinson
turned
slowly
away
from
the
grave
you
are
right
he
said
with
an
effort
our
business
is
with
the
living
now
the
dead
must
wait
hide
and
seek
growled
trendon
if
he
here
why
do
he
show
himself
the
other
shook
his
head
place
is
all
trampled
up
with
his
footprints
said
trendon
plodded
back
and
forth
like
a
prisoner
in
a
cell
the
ledger
said
the
captain
i
forgotten
it
that
grave
drove
everything
else
out
of
my
mind
bring
the
book
here
called
trendon
congdon
unwrapped
it
from
his
jacket
and
handed
it
to
him
the
sailors
cast
curious
glances
at
the
two
headstones
mount
guard
over
edwards
grave
commanded
the
captain
the
coxswain
saluted
and
gave
an
order
one
of
the
sailors
stepped
forward
to
the
first
mound
not
that
one
rasped
the
officer
the
other
the
man
saluted
and
moved
on
with
your
permission
sir
said
trendon
on
a
nod
from
his
superior
officer
he
opened
the
ledger
and
took
up
darrow
record
here
it
is
entry
of
june
lovely
schooner
lost

dear
not
exactly
though
i
should
mind
having
her
under
orders
for
a
few
days
queer
glow
in
the
sky
last
night
if
they
been
investigating
they
may
have
got
what
coming
to

volcano
exhibiting
fits
of

quite
spectacular
but
no
harm
done

too
hot
for

no

said
the
captain
evening
thick
and
squally
weather
again
local
atmospheric
conditions
seem
upset
volcano
still
leading
strenuous
life
climbed
the
headland
this
afternoon
wind
very
shifty
got
an
occasional
whiff
of
volcanic
output
one
in
particular
would
have
sent
a
skunk
to
the
camphor
bottle
no
living
on

will
explore

with
a
view
to

have
come
down
to
an
allowance
of
seven
cigarettes
per
diem
june
explored
cave
full
of
dead
seals
not
only
dead
but
all
bitten
and
cut
to
pieces
must
have
been
lively
doings
in
not
much
choice
between
air
in
the
cave
and
vapours
from
the
volcano
barring
seals
everything
suitable
for
light
housekeeping
such
as
mine
undertook
to
clean
house
dragged
late
lamented
out
into
the
water
some
sank
and
were
swept
away
by
the
others
i
regret
to
say
floated
found
trickle
of
fresh
water
in
depth
of
cave
and
little
to
sleep
on
so
far
so
good
we
may
be
yet
if
only
i
had
my
cigarette
supply
once
heard
a
botanist
say
that
leaves
of
the
white
made
fair
substitute
for
tobacco
fair
substitute
for
nux
vomica
would
like
to
interview
said
the
fellow
is
a
tobacco
maniac
growled
trendon
feeling
in
his
breast
pocket
the
devil
he
cried
bringing
forth
an
empty
hand
silently
the
captain
handed
him
a
cigar
thank
you
sir
he
said
lighted
it
and
continued
reading
had
a
caller
climbed
the
headland
this
morning
found
volcano
taking
a
day
off
looking
for
sign
of
noticed
something
heliographing
to
me
from
the
waves
beyond
the
reef
seemed
to
be
metal
i
guessed
a
tin
can
caught
in
the
swirl
it
rounded
the
cape
and
i
came
down
to
the
shore
to
meet
it
halfway
down
the
cliff
i
had
a
better
view
i
saw
it
was
not
a
tin
can
there
was
a
dark
body
under
it
which
the
waves
were
tossing
about
and
as
the
metal
moved
with
the
body
it
glinted
in
the
sun
suddenly
it
was
borne
in
upon
me
that
an
arm
was
doing
the
signalling
waving
to
me
with
a
sprightly
even
a
jocular
friendliness
then
i
saw
what
it
really
was
it
was
handy
solomon
and
his
steel
hook
he
was
riding
quite
high
every
now
and
again
he
would
bow
and
wave
he
grounded
gently
on
the
sand
beach
i
planted
him
promptly
first
however
i
removed
a
bag
of
tobacco
from
his
pocket
poor
stuff
and
water
soaked
but
still
tobacco
spent
a
quiet
afternoon
carving
a
headstone
for
the
dear
departed
pity
it
were
that
virtues
so
shining
should
be
uncommemorated
idle
as
the
speculation
is
i
wonder
who
my
next
visitor
will
be
thrackles
i
hope
evidently
some
of
them
have
been
playing
the
part
of
pandora
spent
last
night
in
the
cave
air
quite
fresh
june
saw
the
glow
again
last
night
the
surgeon
paused
in
his
reading
that
would
be
the
night
of
the
the
night
before
we
picked
her
up
empty
yes
agreed
captain
parkinson
that
was
the
night
billy
edwards
go
on
the
glow
again
last
night
do
understand
it
once
should
have
been
enough
for
them
this
matter
of
hoarding
tobacco
may
be
a
sad
error
if
old
spitfire
keeps
on
the
way
she
has
i
sha
need
much
more
it
would
be
a
raw
jest
to
be
burned
or
swallowed
up
with
a
month
supply
of
unsmoked
cigarettes
on
one
cave
getting
shaky
still
i
think
stick
there
as
between
being
burned
alive
and
buried
alive
i
for
the
respectable
and
time
honoured
fashion
of
interment
bombardment
was
mostly
to
the
east
but
no
telling
when
it
may
shift
june
this
morning
i
found
a
body
rolling
in
the
surf
it
was
the
body
of
a
young
man
large
and
strongly
built
dressed
in
the
uniform
of
an
ensign
of
our
navy
surely
a
strange
visitor
to
these
shores
there
was
no
mark
of
identification
upon
him
except
a
cigarette
case
graven
with
an
undecipherable
monogram
in
tiffany
most
illegible
style
of
inscription
this
i
buried
with
him
and
staked
the
grave
with
a
headboard
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
a
youth
of
friendly
ways
and
kindly
living
if
one
may
judge
by
the
face
of
the
dead
and
he
comes
by
the
same
end
to
the
same
goal
as
handy
solomon
why
not
and
why
should
one
philosophise
in
a
book
that
will
never
be
read
hold
on
perhaps
just
perhaps
it
may
be
read
the
officer
was
not
long
dead
ensigns
of
the
navy
do
not
wander
about
untraversed
waters
alone
there
must
be
a
warship
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
but
why
then
an
unburied
officer
floating
on
the
ocean
i
will
smoke
upon
this
luxuriously
and
plentifully
later
no
use
i
ca
solve
it
but
one
thing
i
do
i
put
up
a
signal
pole
on
the
headland
and
cache
this
record
under
it
this
afternoon
from
day
to
day
with
the
kindly
permission
of
the
volcano
i
will
add
to
it
bad
doings
by
old
spitfire
the
cloud
is
coming
down
on
me
also
seems
to
be
moving
along
the
cliff
i
will
retire
hastily
to
my
private
estate
in
the
that
all
except
the
scrawl
on
the
last
page
said
trendon
some
action
of
the
volcano
scared
him
off
he
just
had
time
to
scrawl
that
last
message
and
drop
the
book
into
the
cache
the
question
is
did
he
get
back
alive
i
doubt
it
said
the
captain
we
will
search
the
headland
for
his
body
but
the
cave
insisted
the
surgeon
we
ought
to
have
found
some
sign
of
him
there
slade
is
the
solution
said
the
captain
we
must
ask
him
they
put
back
to
the
ship
barnett
was
anxiously
awaiting
them
your
patient
has
been
in
a
bad
way
trendon
he
said
what
wrong
asked
trendon
frowning
he
came
up
on
deck
and
staggering
there
was
a
sheet
of
paper
in
his
hand
which
seemed
to
have
some
bearing
on
his
trouble
when
he
found
you
had
gone
to
the
island
without
him
he
began
to
rage
like
a
maniac
i
had
to
have
him
carried
down
by
force
in
the
rumpus
the
paper
disappeared
i
assumed
the
responsibility
of
giving
him
an
opiate
quite
right
approved
trendon
i
go
down
will
you
come
with
me
sir
he
said
to
the
captain
they
found
slade
in
profound
slumber
wo
do
to
wake
him
now
growled
trendon
hello
what
here
lying
in
the
hollow
of
the
sick
man
right
hand
where
it
had
been
crushed
to
a
ball
was
a
crumpled
mass
of
tracing
paper
trendon
smoothed
it
out
peered
at
it
and
passed
it
to
the
captain
it
a
sketch
of
an
indian
he
exclaimed
in
surprise
at
the
first
glance
what
are
all
these
marks
map
of
the
island
barked
trendon
look
here
the
drawing
was
a
fairly
careful
one
showing
such
geographical
points
as
had
been
of
concern
to
the
inhabitants
there
was
the
large
cavern
indicated
as
they
had
found
it
and
at
a
point
between
it
and
the
headland
the
legend
seal
cave
but
it
wrong
cried
captain
parkinson
setting
finger
to
the
spot
we
passed
there
twice
there
no
opening
no
guarantee
that
there
may
not
have
been
returned
the
other
this
island
has
been
considerably
shaken
up
lately
entrance
may
have
been
closed
by
a
landslide
down
the
cliff
noticed
signs
myself
but
think
of
it
in
connection
with
the
cave
that
work
for
barnett
then
said
the
captain
brightening
blow
up
the
whole
face
of
the
cliff
if
necessary
but
we
get
at
that
cave
he
hurried
out
order
followed
order
and
soon
the
gig
with
the
captain
trendon
and
the
torpedo
expert
was
driving
for
the
point
marked
seal
cave
on
the
map
over
which
they
were
bent
vi
darrow
receives
you
say
the
last
entry
is
june
asked
barnett
as
the
boat
entered
the
light
surf
trendon
nodded
that
was
the
night
we
saw
the
last
glow
and
the
big
burst
from
the
volcano
was
it
right
the
island
would
have
been
badly
shaken
up
not
so
violently
but
that
the
stood
said
the
captain
that
true
sir
but
there
been
a
good
deal
of
volcanic
gas
going
the
man
been
penned
up
for
four
days
give
the
fellow
a
chance
growled
trendon
air
may
be
all
right
in
the
cave
good
water
there
too
says
so
himself
by
slade
account
he
a
pretty
capable
citizen
when
it
comes
to
looking
after
himself
wonder
if
we
find
him
fit
as
a
fiddle
there
was
no
clue
to
ives
and
mcguire
asked
barnett
presently
none
it
was
the
captain
who
answered
the
gig
grated
and
the
tide
being
high
they
waded
to
the
base
of
the
cliff
barnett
carrying
his
precious
explosives
aloft
in
his
arms
here
the
spot
said
the
captain
see
where
the
water
goes
in
through
those
crevices
opening
at
the
top
too
said
trendon
he
let
out
his
bellow
roaring
darrow
name
i
doubt
if
you
could
project
your
voice
far
into
a
cave
thus
blocked
said
captain
parkinson
we
try
this
he
drew
his
revolver
and
fired
the
men
listened
at
the
crevices
of
the
rock
no
sound
came
from
within
your
enterprise
barnett
said
the
commander
with
a
gesture
which
turned
over
the
conduct
of
the
affair
to
the
torpedo
expert
barnett
examined
the
rocks
with
enthusiasm
looks
like
moderately
easy
stuff
he
observed
see
how
the
veins
run
you
could
almost
blow
a
design
to
order
in
that
yes
but
how
about
bringing
down
the
whole
cave
oh
of
course
there
always
an
element
of
uncertainty
when
dealing
with
high
explosives
admitted
the
expert
but
unless
mistaken
we
can
chop
this
out
as
neat
as
with
an
axe
dropping
his
load
of
cartridges
carelessly
upon
a
flat
rock
which
projected
from
the
water
he
busied
himself
in
a
search
along
the
face
of
the
cliff
presently
with
an
ah
of
satisfaction
he
climbed
toward
a
hand
breadth
of
platform
where
grew
a
patch
of
purple
flowers
throw
me
up
a
knife
somebody
he
called
take
notice
said
trendon
that
i
the
botanist
of
this
expedition
oh
you
can
have
the
flowers
all
i
want
is
what
they
grow
in
loosening
a
handful
of
the
dry
soil
he
brought
it
down
and
laid
it
with
the
explosives
next
he
called
one
of
the
sailors
to
boost
him
and
was
soon
perched
on
the
flat
slant
of
a
huge
rock
which
formed
as
it
were
the
keystone
to
the
blockade
let
see
he
ruminated
we
want
a
slow
charge
for
this
one
that
will
exert
a
widespread
pressure
without
much
shattering
force
the
no
i
think
how
is
that
mr
barnett
asked
the
captain
with
lively
interest
you
see
sir
returned
the
demonstrator
perched
high
like
a
sculptor
at
work
on
some
heroic
masterpiece
what
we
want
is
to
split
off
this
rock
he
patted
the
flank
of
the
huge
slab
there
a
lovely
vein
running
at
an
angle
inward
from
where
i
sit
split
that
through
and
the
rock
should
roll
of
its
own
weight
away
from
the
entrance
it
held
only
by
the
upper
projection
that
runs
under
the
arch
here
neat
programme
commented
trendon
with
a
tinge
of
sardonic
scepticism
wait
and
see
retorted
barnett
blithely
for
he
was
in
his
element
now
i
appoint
you
my
assistant
just
toss
me
up
that
cartridge
the
third
one
on
the
left
the
surgeon
recoiled
supposing
you
do
catch
it
well
supposing
i
do
it
dynamite
is
it
something
of
the
same
nature
joveite
it
called
still
the
surgeon
stared
at
him
barnett
laughed
oh
you
got
the
high
explosives
superstition
he
said
lightly
dynamite
do
go
off
as
easy
as
people
think
you
could
drop
that
stuff
from
the
cliffhead
without
danger
have
i
got
to
come
down
for
it
with
a
wry
face
trendon
tossed
up
the
package
it
was
deftly
caught
now
wet
that
dirt
well
put
it
in
the
canvas
bag
yonder
and
send
one
of
the
men
up
with
it
i
going
to
make
a
mud
pie
breaking
the
package
open
he
spread
the
yellow
powder
in
a
slightly
curving
line
along
the
rock
with
the
mud
he
capped
this
over
forming
a
little
arched
roof
to
keep
it
from
blowing
away
surmised
trendon
no
to
make
it
blow
down
instead
of
blowing
up
oh
rot
returned
the
downright
surgeon
that
pound
of
dirt
wo
make
the
shadow
of
a
feather
difference
wo
it
retorted
the
other
curious
thing
about
high
explosives
a
will
hold
down
the
force
as
well
as
a
ton
of
rock
wait
and
see
what
happens
to
the
rock
beneath
he
slid
off
his
perch
into
the
water
and
waded
out
to
the
boat
here
he
burrowed
for
a
moment
presently
emerging
with
a
box
this
he
carried
gingerly
to
a
convenient
rock
and
opened
first
he
lifted
out
some
soft
padding
a
small
tin
box
inside
came
to
light
with
infinite
precaution
barnett
picked
out
an
object
that
looked
like
a
calibre
short
cartridge
wadded
some
cotton
batten
in
his
hand
set
the
thing
in
the
wadding
laid
it
on
the
rock
carefully
returned
the
small
box
to
the
large
box
and
the
large
box
to
the
boat
took
up
the
cartridge
again
and
waded
back
to
the
cliff
they
watched
him
in
silence
this
is
the
little
devil
he
said
indicating
his
delicate
burden
fulminate
of
mercury
this
is
the
stuff
that
remove
your
hand
with
neatness
and
despatch
it
the
quickest
tempered
little
article
in
the
business
just
give
it
one
hard
look
and
it
off
here
said
trendon
i
resign
from
now
on
i
a
spectator
barnett
swung
the
fulminate
in
his
handkerchief
and
gave
it
to
a
sailor
to
hold
the
man
dandled
it
like
a
infant
back
to
his
rock
went
barnett
producing
some
cord
he
let
down
an
end
tie
the
handkerchief
on
and
get
out
of
the
way
he
directed
with
painful
slowness
the
man
carried
out
the
first
part
of
the
order
the
latter
half
he
obeyed
with
sprightly
alacrity
very
slowly
very
delicately
the
expert
drew
in
his
dangerous
burden
once
a
current
of
air
puffed
it
against
the
face
of
the
rock
and
the
operator
head
was
hastily
withdrawn
nothing
happened
another
minute
and
he
had
the
tiny
shell
in
hand
a
fuse
was
fixed
in
it
and
it
was
shoved
under
the
barnett
stood
up
will
you
kindly
order
the
boat
ready
captain
parkinson
he
called
the
order
was
given
as
soon
as
i
light
the
fuse
i
will
come
down
and
we
pull
out
fifty
yards
leave
the
rest
of
the
joveite
where
it
is
all
ready
here
goes
he
touched
a
match
to
the
fuse
it
caught
for
a
moment
he
watched
it
going
all
right
he
reported
as
he
struck
the
water
plenty
of
time
some
seventy
yards
out
they
rested
on
their
oars
they
waited
and
waited
and
waited
it
out
grunted
trendon
from
the
face
of
the
cliff
puffed
a
cloud
of
dust
a
thudding
report
boomed
over
the
water
just
a
wisp
of
smoke
arose
and
beneath
it
the
great
rock
with
a
gapping
seam
across
its
top
rolled
majestically
outward
sending
a
shower
of
spray
on
all
sides
and
opening
to
their
eager
view
a
black
chasm
into
the
heart
of
the
headland
the
experiment
had
worked
out
with
the
accuracy
of
a
geometric
problem
that
all
sir
barnett
reported
officially
magic
modern
magic
said
the
captain
he
stared
at
the
open
door
for
the
moment
the
object
of
the
undertaking
was
forgotten
in
the
wonder
of
its
exact
accomplishment
darrow
think
an
earthquake
come
after
him
remarked
trendon
give
way
ordered
the
captain
the
boat
grated
on
the
sand
captain
parkinson
would
have
entered
but
barnett
restrained
him
it
best
to
wait
a
minute
or
two
he
advised
occasionally
slides
follow
an
explosion
tardily
and
the
gases
do
always
dissipate
quickly
where
they
stood
they
could
see
but
a
short
way
into
the
cave
trendon
squatted
and
funnelled
his
hands
to
one
eye
illustration
sorry
not
to
have
met
you
at
the
door
he
said
courteously
there
fire
inside
he
said
in
a
moment
they
all
saw
it
a
single
glow
far
back
in
the
blackness
a
cyclopean
eye
that
swayed
as
it
approached
alternately
it
waned
and
brightened
suddenly
it
illuminated
the
dim
lineaments
of
a
face
the
face
neared
them
it
joined
itself
to
reality
by
a
very
solid
pair
of
shoulders
and
a
man
sauntered
into
the
twilit
mouth
of
the
cavern
removed
a
cigarette
from
his
lips
and
gave
them
greeting
sorry
not
to
have
met
you
at
the
door
he
said
courteously
it
was
you
that
knocked
was
it
not
yes
it
roused
me
from
my
siesta
they
stared
at
him
in
silence
he
blinked
in
the
light
with
unaccustomed
eyes
you
will
pardon
me
for
not
asking
you
in
at
once
past
circumstances
have
rendered
me
well
perhaps
suspicious
is
not
too
strong
a
word
they
noticed
that
he
held
a
revolver
in
his
hand
captain
parkinson
came
forward
a
step
the
host
half
raised
his
weapon
then
he
dropped
it
abruptly
navy
men
he
said
in
an
altered
voice
i
beg
your
pardon
i
could
not
see
at
first
my
name
is
percy
darrow
i
am
captain
parkinson
of
the
united
states
cruiser
said
the
commander
this
is
barnett
darrow
trendon
mr
darrow
they
shook
hands
all
around
like
some
damned
silly
afternoon
tea
trendon
said
later
in
retailing
it
to
the
mess
a
pause
followed
wo
you
step
in
gentlemen
said
darrow
may
i
offer
you
the
makings
of
a
cigarette
would
you
be
robbing
yourself
inquired
the
captain
with
a
twinkle
oh
you
found
the
diary
then
said
darrow
easily
rather
silly
of
me
to
complain
so
but
really
in
conditions
like
these
tobacco
becomes
a
serious
problem
so
one
might
imagine
said
trendon
drily
he
looked
closely
at
darrow
the
man
eyes
were
light
and
dancing
from
the
nostrils
two
livid
lines
ran
diagonally
such
lines
one
might
make
with
a
hard
blue
pencil
pressed
strongly
into
the
flesh
the
surgeon
moved
a
little
nearer
can
you
give
me
any
news
of
my
friend
thrackles
asked
darrow
lightly
or
the
esteemed
pulz
or
the
scholarly
and
urbane
robinson
of
ethiopian
extraction
dead
said
the
captain
ah
a
pity
said
the
other
he
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
i
had
thought
it
probable
his
face
twitched
dead
very
good
in
fact
really
er
amusing
he
began
to
laugh
quite
to
himself
it
was
not
a
pleasant
laugh
to
hear
trendon
caught
and
shook
him
by
the
shoulder
drop
it
he
said
darrow
seemed
not
to
hear
him
dead
all
dead
he
repeated
and
outlasted
god
damn
i
outlasted
and
his
mirth
broke
forth
in
a
strangely
shocking
spasm
trendon
lifted
a
hand
and
struck
him
so
powerfully
between
the
shoulder
blades
that
he
all
but
plunged
forward
on
his
face
quit
it
he
ordered
again
get
hold
of
yourself
darrow
turned
and
gripped
him
the
surgeon
winced
with
the
pain
of
his
grasp
i
ca
gasped
the
maroon
between
paroxysms
i
been
living
in
hell
a
black
shaking
shivering
hell
for
god
knows
how
long
what
do
you
know
have
you
ever
been
buried
alive
and
again
the
agony
of
laughter
shook
him
this
then
muttered
the
doctor
and
the
hypodermic
needle
shot
home
during
the
return
darrow
lay
like
a
log
in
the
bottom
of
the
gig
the
opiate
had
done
its
work
consciousness
was
mercifully
dead
within
him
vii
the
survivors
rest
and
good
food
quickly
brought
percy
darrow
back
to
his
normal
poise
one
inspection
satisfied
trendon
that
all
was
well
with
him
he
asked
to
see
the
captain
and
that
gentleman
came
to
ives
room
which
had
been
assigned
to
the
rescued
man
i
hope
you
been
able
to
make
yourself
comfortable
said
the
commander
courteously
it
would
be
strange
indeed
if
i
could
not
returned
darrow
smiling
you
forget
that
you
have
set
a
savage
down
in
the
midst
of
luxury
make
yourself
free
of
ives
things
invited
captain
parkinson
poor
fellow
he
will
not
use
them
again
i
fear
one
of
your
men
lost
asked
darrow
ah
the
young
officer
whose
body
i
found
on
the
beach
perhaps
no
but
we
have
to
thank
you
for
that
burial
said
the
captain
darrow
made
a
swift
gesture
oh
if
thanks
are
going
he
cried
and
paused
in
hopelessness
of
adequate
expression
this
has
been
a
bitter
cruise
for
us
continued
the
captain
he
sighed
and
was
silent
for
a
moment
there
is
much
to
tell
and
to
be
told
he
resumed
much
agreed
the
other
gravely
you
will
want
to
see
slade
first
i
presume
said
the
captain
one
of
your
officers
whom
i
have
not
yet
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
the
captain
stared
slade
he
said
ralph
slade
apparently
there
a
missing
link
or
i
fear
i
was
not
wholly
myself
yesterday
for
a
time
possibly
something
occurred
that
i
did
not
quite
take
in
perhaps
we
better
wait
said
captain
parkinson
with
obvious
misgiving
you
not
quite
rested
you
will
feel
more
like
if
you
do
mind
said
darrow
composedly
i
like
to
get
at
this
thing
now
i
in
excellent
understanding
i
assure
you
very
well
i
am
speaking
of
the
man
who
acted
as
mate
in
the
the
journalist
who
good
heavens
what
arrant
stupidity
i
have
to
beg
your
pardon
darrow
it
has
just
occurred
to
me
he
called
himself
eagen
with
you
eagen
what
is
this
is
eagen
alive
and
on
this
ship
we
picked
him
up
in
an
open
boat
and
you
say
he
calls
himself
slade
he
is
ralph
slade
adventurer
and
journalist
barnett
knows
him
and
vouches
for
him
and
he
was
on
our
island
under
an
assumed
name
said
darrow
in
tones
that
had
the
smoothness
and
the
rasp
of
silk
rather
annoying
not
good
form
quite
even
for
a
pirate
yet
i
believe
he
saved
your
life
suggested
the
captain
darrow
looked
up
sharply
why
yes
he
admitted
so
he
did
i
had
hoped
he
checked
himself
i
had
thought
that
all
of
the
crew
went
the
same
way
you
did
find
any
of
the
others
none
darrow
got
to
his
feet
i
think
i
like
to
see
eagen
slade
whatever
he
calls
himself
i
do
know
began
the
captain
it
might
not
be
he
hesitated
and
stopped
darrow
drew
back
a
little
misinterpreting
the
other
attitude
do
i
understand
that
i
am
under
restraint
he
asked
stiffly
certainly
not
why
should
you
be
well
returned
the
other
contemplatively
it
really
might
be
regarded
as
a
subject
for
investigation
of
course
i
know
only
a
small
part
of
it
but
there
have
certainly
been
suspicious
circumstances
piracy
there
has
been
no
doubt
of
that
murder
too
if
my
intuitions
are
not
at
fault
or
at
least
a
disappearance
to
be
accounted
for
robbery
ca
be
denied
and
there
a
dead
body
or
two
to
be
properly
accredited
he
looked
the
captain
in
the
eye
well
you
find
my
story
highly
unsatisfactory
in
detail
i
fancy
i
merely
want
to
know
whether
i
to
present
it
as
a
defence
or
only
an
explanation
we
shall
be
glad
to
hear
your
story
when
you
are
ready
to
tell
it
after
you
have
seen
mr
slade
thank
you
said
darrow
simply
you
have
heard
his
yes
it
needs
filling
in
when
may
i
see
him
that
for
trendon
to
say
he
came
to
us
almost
dead
i
find
out
the
surgeon
reported
slade
much
better
but
all
with
excitement
hate
to
put
the
strain
on
him
said
he
but
he
be
in
a
fever
till
he
gets
this
thing
off
his
mind
send
darrow
to
him
after
a
moment
consideration
darrow
said
i
should
like
to
have
you
and
trendon
present
captain
parkinson
while
i
ask
eagen
one
or
two
questions
understand
one
thing
darrow
said
trendon
briefly
this
is
not
to
be
an
inquisition
ah
said
darrow
unmoved
i
to
be
neither
defendant
nor
prosecutor
you
are
to
respect
the
condition
of
trendon
patient
sir
said
captain
parkinson
with
emphasis
outside
of
that
your
attitude
toward
a
man
who
has
twice
thought
of
your
life
before
his
own
is
for
you
to
determine
no
little
cynicism
lurked
in
darrow
tones
as
he
said
you
have
confidence
in
slade
alias
eagen
yes
replied
captain
parkinson
in
a
tone
that
closed
that
topic
still
i
should
be
glad
to
have
you
gentlemen
present
if
only
for
a
moment
insisted
darrow
presently
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
on
account
of
the
patient
said
the
surgeon
significantly
very
well
assented
the
captain
the
three
went
to
slade
cabin
he
was
lying
propped
up
in
his
bunk
trendon
entered
first
followed
by
the
captain
then
darrow
here
your
prize
slade
said
the
surgeon
darrow
halted
just
inside
the
door
with
an
eager
light
in
his
face
slade
leaned
forward
and
stretched
out
his
hand
i
could
believe
it
until
i
saw
you
old
man
he
cried
darrow
eyebrows
went
up
before
slade
had
time
to
note
that
there
was
no
response
to
his
outstretched
hand
the
surgeon
had
jumped
in
and
pushed
him
roughly
back
upon
his
pillow
what
did
you
promise
he
growled
you
were
to
lie
still
were
you
and
you
do
it
or
out
we
go
how
are
you
eagen
drawled
darrow
not
eagen
i
done
with
that
they
told
you
have
they
darrow
nodded
are
you
the
only
survivor
he
inquired
except
yourself
the
nigger
pulz
thrackles
the
captain
all
drowned
not
the
captain
they
murdered
him
ah
said
darrow
softly
and
you
i
beg
your
pardon
your
er
friends
disposed
of
the
doctor
in
the
same
way
handy
solomon
replied
slade
with
shaking
lips
hell
got
that
fiend
if
there
a
hell
for
human
fiends
they
threw
the
doctor
body
in
the
surf
you
did
notice
whether
there
were
any
papers
if
there
were
they
must
have
been
destroyed
with
the
body
when
the
lava
poured
down
the
valley
into
the
sea
the
lava
of
course
assented
darrow
with
elaborate
nonchalance
well
he
was
a
kind
old
boy
a
cheerful
simple
wise
old
child
i
would
have
given
my
right
hand
to
save
him
cried
slade
it
was
so
sudden
so
damnable
better
to
have
saved
him
than
me
said
darrow
he
spoke
with
the
first
touch
of
feeling
that
he
exhibited
i
have
to
thank
you
for
my
life
eagen
i
beg
your
pardon
slade
it
hard
to
remember
trendon
arose
and
captain
parkinson
with
him
give
you
two
hours
darrow
said
the
surgeon
no
more
if
he
seems
exhausted
give
him
one
of
these
powders
i
look
in
in
an
hour
at
the
end
of
an
hour
he
returned
slade
was
lying
back
on
his
pillow
darrow
was
talking
eagerly
confidentially
in
another
hour
he
came
out
the
whole
thing
is
clear
he
said
to
captain
parkinson
i
am
ready
to
report
to
you
this
evening
said
the
captain
the
mess
will
want
to
hear
yes
they
will
want
to
hear
assented
darrow
you
had
slade
story
i
take
it
up
where
he
left
off
and
he
check
me
mine
as
incredible
as
as
slade
was
and
it
as
true
viii
the
maker
of
marvels
as
they
had
gathered
to
hear
ralph
slade
tale
so
now
the
depleted
mess
of
the
grouped
themselves
for
percy
darrow
sequel
slade
himself
sat
directly
across
from
the
doctor
assistant
before
him
lay
a
paper
covered
with
jotted
notes
trendon
slouched
low
in
the
chair
on
slade
right
captain
parkinson
had
the
other
side
convenient
to
darrow
hand
lay
the
material
for
cigarettes
as
he
talked
he
rolled
cylinder
after
cylinder
and
between
sentences
consumed
them
in
long
satisfying
puffs
first
you
will
want
to
learn
of
the
fate
of
your
friends
and
shipmates
he
began
they
are
dead
one
of
them
edwards
fell
to
my
hands
to
bury
as
you
know
he
lies
beside
handy
solomon
the
others
we
shall
probably
not
see
any
one
of
a
score
of
ocean
currents
may
have
swept
them
far
away
the
last
great
glow
that
you
saw
was
the
signal
of
their
destruction
so
the
work
of
a
great
scientist
a
potent
benefactor
of
the
race
a
gentle
and
kindly
old
heart
has
brought
about
the
death
of
your
friends
and
of
my
enemies
the
innocent
and
the
guilty
the
murderer
with
his
plunder
the
officer
following
his
duty
one
and
the
same
end
a
paltry
thing
our
vaunted
science
is
in
the
face
of
such
tangled
fates
he
spoke
low
and
bitterly
then
he
squared
his
shoulders
and
his
manner
became
businesslike
interrupt
me
when
any
point
needs
clearing
up
he
said
it
a
blind
trail
at
best
you
the
right
to
see
it
as
plain
as
i
can
make
it
with
slade
help
cut
right
in
with
your
questions
there
be
plenty
to
answer
and
some
never
will
be
answered
now
let
me
get
this
thing
laid
out
clearly
in
my
own
mind
you
first
saw
the
glow
let
me
see
night
of
june
said
barnett
june
agreed
darrow
that
was
the
end
of
solomon
thrackles
a
very
surprising
end
to
them
if
they
had
time
to
think
he
added
grimly
surprising
enough
from
the
survivor
viewpoint
said
slade
doubtless
they
had
that
story
from
you
i
need
go
over
it
this
ship
picked
up
the
deserted
and
put
your
first
crew
aboard
that
night
was
it
not
you
saw
the
second
pillar
of
fire
barnett
nodded
so
your
men
met
their
death
then
came
the
second
finding
of
the
empty
schooner
captain
parkinson
they
must
have
been
brave
men
who
faced
the
unknown
terrors
of
that
prodigy
they
volunteered
sir
said
the
captain
with
simple
pride
darrow
bowed
with
a
suggestion
of
reverence
in
the
slow
movement
of
his
head
and
that
night
or
was
it
two
nights
later
you
saw
the
last
appearance
of
the
portent
well
i
shall
come
to
that
slade
has
told
you
how
they
lived
on
the
beach
with
us
in
the
valley
it
was
different
almost
from
the
first
i
was
alone
the
doctor
ceased
to
be
a
companion
he
ceased
to
be
human
almost
a
machine
that
what
he
was
his
one
human
instinct
was
well
distrust
his
whole
force
of
being
was
centred
on
his
discovery
it
was
to
make
him
the
foremost
scientist
of
the
world
the
foremost
individual
entity
of
his
time
of
all
time
possibly
even
to
outline
it
to
you
would
take
too
much
time
light
heat
motive
power
in
incredible
degrees
and
under
such
control
as
has
never
been
known
these
were
to
be
the
agencies
at
his
call
the
push
of
a
button
the
turn
of
a
screw
oh
he
was
to
be
master
of
such
power
as
no
monarch
ever
wielded
riches
pshaw
riches
were
the
least
of
it
he
could
create
them
practically
but
they
would
be
superfluous
power
unlimited
absolute
power
was
his
goal
with
his
end
achieved
he
could
establish
an
autocracy
a
dynasty
of
science
whatever
he
chose
oh
it
was
a
golden
glowing
dream
a
dream
such
as
men
souls
do
formulate
in
these
stale
days
not
our
kind
of
men
the
teutonic
mysticism
you
understand
and
it
was
all
true
oh
quite
do
you
mean
us
to
understand
that
he
had
this
power
you
describe
asked
captain
parkinson
in
his
grasp
then
comes
a
practical
gentleman
with
a
steel
hook
a
follower
of
dreams
too
in
his
way
conflicting
interests
you
know
how
it
is
one
blow
from
the
more
practical
dreamer
and
the
greater
vision
passes
i
getting
ahead
of
myself
just
a
moment
his
cigarette
glowed
fiercely
in
the
dimness
before
he
took
up
his
tale
again
you
all
know
who
schermerhorn
was
none
of
you
know
i
do
know
myself
though
i
been
his
factotum
for
ten
years
along
how
many
varied
lines
of
activity
that
mind
played
one
of
them
was
the
secret
of
energy
concentrated
resistless
energy
man
contrivances
were
too
puny
for
him
the
most
powerful
engines
he
regarded
as
toys
for
a
time
high
explosives
claimed
his
attention
he
wanted
to
harness
them
once
he
got
to
the
point
of
practical
experiment
you
can
see
the
ruins
yet
a
hole
in
southern
new
jersey
nobody
ever
understood
how
he
escaped
but
there
he
was
on
his
feet
across
a
fence
in
a
ploughed
field
yes
he
flew
the
fence
and
running
running
furiously
in
the
opposite
direction
when
the
dust
cleared
away
someone
stopped
him
finally
told
him
the
danger
was
over
i
will
not
return
he
said
firmly
and
fainted
away
that
disgusted
him
with
high
explosives
what
secrets
he
discovered
he
gave
to
the
government
they
were
not
without
value
i
believe
they
were
not
indeed
corroborated
barnett
next
his
interest
turned
to
the
natural
phenomena
of
high
energy
he
studied
lightning
in
an
open
steel
network
laboratory
with
few
results
save
a
succession
of
rheumatic
attacks
and
an
improved
electric
interrupter
since
adopted
by
one
of
the
great
telegraph
companies
the
former
obliged
him
to
stop
these
experiments
and
the
invention
he
considered
trivial
probably
the
great
problem
of
getting
at
the
secret
of
energy
led
him
into
his
attempts
to
study
the
mysterious
electrical
waves
radiated
by
lightning
flashes
at
any
rate
he
was
soon
as
deep
into
the
subject
of
electrical
science
as
his
countryman
hertz
had
ever
been
he
used
to
tell
me
that
he
often
wondered
why
he
had
taken
up
this
line
before
the
world
of
energy
he
now
set
out
to
explore
waves
in
that
tremendous
range
between
those
we
hear
and
those
we
see
it
was
natural
that
he
should
then
come
to
the
most
prominent
elements
uranium
thorium
and
radium
but
though
his
knowledge
surpassed
that
of
the
authorities
he
was
never
satisfied
with
any
of
his
results
no
he
would
exclaim
has
not
the
great
power
the
mines
are
not
deep
enough
yet
then
suddenly
the
great
idea
that
was
to
bring
him
success
and
cost
him
his
life
came
to
him
the
bowels
of
the
earth
must
hold
the
secret
he
took
up
volcanoes
does
all
this
sound
foolish
it
was
not
if
you
knew
the
man
he
was
a
mighty
enthusiast
a
born
martyr
not
like
the
rest
of
us
the
fire
was
in
his
veins
a
light
please
thank
you
we
chased
volcanoes
there
was
a
theory
under
it
all
he
believed
that
volcanic
emanations
are
caused
by
a
mighty
and
uncomprehended
energy
something
that
achieves
results
ascribable
neither
to
explosions
nor
heat
some
eternal
inner
source
radium
if
you
choose
only
he
did
call
it
that
radium
itself
as
known
to
our
modern
scientists
he
regarded
as
the
harmless
plaything
of
people
with
time
hanging
heavy
on
their
hands
he
was
after
force
in
quantities
he
wanted
bulk
results
yet
i
believe
that
after
all
what
he
sought
was
a
sort
of
higher
power
of
radium
the
phenomena
were
related
and
he
had
some
of
that
concentrated
essence
of
pitchblende
in
the
chest
when
we
started
oh
not
much
say
about
twenty
thousand
dollars
worth
maybe
thirty
for
use
no
rather
for
comparison
i
judge
yes
we
chased
volcanoes
i
became
used
to
camping
between
sample
hells
of
all
known
varieties
i
got
so
that
the
fumes
of
a
sulphur
match
seemed
like
a
draught
of
pure
fresh
air
wherever
any
of
the
earth
pimples
showed
signs
of
coming
to
a
head
there
were
we
taking
part
in
the
trouble
by
and
by
the
doctor
got
so
thoroughly
poisoned
that
he
had
to
lay
off
back
to
philadelphia
we
came
there
an
aged
seafaring
person
temporarily
stranded
mulcted
the
professor
of
a
dollar
an
undertaking
that
required
no
art
and
in
the
course
of
his
recital
touched
upon
yonder
little
cesspool
of
infernal
iniquities
an
uncharted
volcanic
island
one
that
he
could
have
all
for
his
own
you
may
guess
whether
schermerhorn
was
interested
iss
for
which
we
haf
sought
percy
he
said
to
me
in
his
quaint
style
of
speech
leedle
prifate
laboratory
to
ourselves
to
have
totally
unknown
undescribed
we
start
i
make
a
list
of
the
get
he
began
his
list
as
i
remember
with
three
dozen
undershirts
a
gallon
of
pennyroyal
for
insect
bites
a
box
of
assorted
fish
hooks
thirty
pounds
of
tea
and
a
case
of
carpet
tacks
when
i
had
anything
else
to
worry
over
i
used
to
lie
awake
at
night
and
speculate
on
the
purpose
of
those
carpet
tacks
he
had
something
in
mind
if
there
was
anything
on
which
he
prided
himself
it
was
his
practical
bent
but
the
list
never
got
any
further
it
ceased
short
of
one
page
in
the
ledger
as
you
may
have
noticed
i
outfitted
by
telegraph
on
the
way
across
the
continent
the
doctor
did
ask
me
whether
i
go
he
took
it
for
granted
probably
why
i
did
back
out
nor
did
i
tell
him
that
the
three
life
insurance
companies
which
had
foolishly
and
trustingly
accepted
me
as
a
risk
merely
on
the
strength
of
a
good
constitution
were
making
frantic
efforts
to
compromise
on
the
policies
they
felt
hurt
those
companies
my
healthy
condition
had
ceased
to
appeal
to
them
what
a
good
constitution
between
earthquakes
no
there
was
no
use
telling
the
doctor
it
would
only
have
worried
him
besides
i
did
believe
that
the
island
was
there
i
thought
it
was
a
myth
of
that
stranded
ancient
imagination
when
it
rose
to
sight
at
the
proper
spot
none
were
more
astounded
than
the
bad
risk
who
now
addresses
you
yet
i
must
say
for
the
island
that
it
came
handsomely
up
to
specifications
down
where
you
were
slade
you
did
get
a
real
insight
into
its
disposition
but
in
back
of
us
there
was
any
kind
of
action
for
your
money
geysers
fuming
fissures
cunning
little
craterlets
with
of
molten
lava
ready
to
serve
hot
more
gases
than
you
could
create
in
all
the
world
chemical
laboratories
in
fact
everything
to
make
the
place
a
paradise
for
old
nick
and
schermerhorn
he
brought
along
in
his
precious
chest
besides
the
radium
some
sort
of
raw
material
also
as
near
as
i
could
make
out
a
sort
of
cage
or
guardianship
scheme
for
his
concentrated
essence
of
cussedness
when
he
should
get
it
out
of
the
volcano
in
the
first
seven
months
he
puttered
around
the
little
fumers
with
an
occasional
excursion
up
to
the
main
crater
it
was
my
duty
to
follow
on
and
drag
him
away
when
he
fell
unconscious
sometimes
i
would
try
to
get
him
before
he
was
quite
gone
then
he
would
become
indignant
and
fight
me
perhaps
that
helped
to
lose
me
his
confidence
more
and
more
he
withdrew
into
himself
there
were
days
when
he
spoke
no
word
to
me
it
was
lonely
do
you
know
why
i
used
to
visit
you
at
the
beach
slade
i
suppose
you
thought
i
was
keeping
watch
on
you
it
was
that
it
was
loneliness
in
a
way
it
hurt
me
too
for
one
could
help
but
be
fond
of
the
old
boy
and
at
times
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
quite
himself
pardon
me
if
i
may
trouble
you
for
the
matches
thanks
matters
went
very
wrong
at
times
the
doctor
fumed
like
his
little
craters
growled
out
exhaustive
german
imprecations
even
eat
then
again
the
demon
of
work
would
drive
him
with
thong
and
spur
he
would
rush
to
his
craters
to
his
laboratories
to
his
ledger
for
the
purpose
of
entering
unintelligible
commentaries
he
had
some
peculiar
contrivance
like
a
misshapen
retort
with
which
he
collected
gases
from
the
craterlets
whenever
i
hear
one
of
those
smash
i
knew
it
was
a
bad
day
meantime
the
volcano
also
became
well
what
you
might
call
temperamental
it
got
to
be
a
year
and
a
quarter
a
year
and
a
half
i
wondered
whether
we
should
ever
get
away
my
tobacco
was
running
short
and
the
bearing
of
the
men
was
becoming
fidgetty
my
visits
to
the
beach
became
quite
interesting
to
me
one
day
the
doctor
came
running
out
of
his
laboratory
with
so
bright
a
face
that
i
ventured
to
ask
him
about
departure
so
long
now
percy
he
said
in
his
old
kind
manner
so
long
the
first
real
success
it
iss
made
we
have
yet
control
to
bring
it
but
it
iss
made
about
time
sir
said
i
we
do
do
something
soon
we
may
have
trouble
with
the
men
said
he
in
surprise
they
could
do
nothing
nothing
he
wagged
his
great
head
confidently
are
armed
yes
armed
so
are
they
are
armed
he
repeated
obstinately
as
no
man
was
ever
armed
are
we
armed
he
checked
himself
abruptly
and
walked
away
well
i
since
wondered
what
would
have
happened
had
the
men
attacked
us
it
would
have
been
worth
seeing
and
and
surprising
yes
i
quite
certain
it
would
have
been
surprising
perhaps
too
i
might
have
learned
more
of
the
great
secret
and
yet
i
do
know
it
all
dark
a
hint
here
theory
mere
glints
of
light
where
did
i
put
ah
thank
you
ix
the
achievement
for
some
moments
darrow
sat
gazing
fixedly
at
the
table
before
him
his
cigarette
tip
glowed
and
failed
someone
suggested
drinks
the
captain
asked
darrow
what
he
would
have
but
the
question
went
unnoted
how
i
passed
the
next
six
months
i
could
hardly
tell
you
he
began
again
quite
abruptly
at
times
i
was
bored
fearfully
bored
yet
the
element
of
mystery
of
uncertainty
of
underlying
peril
gave
a
certain
zest
to
the
affair
in
the
periods
of
dulness
i
found
some
amusement
in
visiting
the
lower
camp
and
baiting
the
nigger
slade
will
have
told
you
about
him
he
possessed
quite
a
fund
of
bastard
voodooism
he
possessed
more
before
i
got
through
with
him
yes
if
he
had
lived
to
return
to
his
country
i
fancy
he
would
have
added
considerably
to
lore
you
remember
the
vampire
bats
slade
and
the
naturally
i
did
mention
to
you
that
the
business
was
altogether
as
clear
to
me
as
i
pretended
it
was
though
but
at
the
time
it
served
very
well
as
an
amusement
all
the
while
i
realised
that
my
entertainment
was
not
without
its
element
of
danger
too
i
remember
glances
not
altogether
friendly
but
always
a
little
doubtful
a
little
awed
even
handy
solomon
practical
as
he
was
had
a
scruple
or
two
of
superstition
in
his
on
which
one
might
work
only
eagen
slade
i
mean
was
beyond
me
there
you
puzzled
me
not
a
little
in
those
days
slade
well
did
i
say
that
i
was
sometimes
annoyed
by
the
doctor
attitude
yes
it
seemed
that
he
might
have
given
me
a
little
more
of
his
confidence
but
one
ca
judge
such
a
man
as
he
was
among
the
ordinary
affairs
of
life
he
had
relied
on
me
for
every
detail
now
he
was
independent
of
me
independent
i
doubt
if
he
remembered
my
existence
at
times
even
in
his
blackest
moods
of
depression
he
was
sufficient
unto
himself
it
was
strange
how
he
did
rage
the
day
the
chemicals
from
washington
went
wrong
i
was
washing
my
shirt
in
the
hot
water
spring
when
he
came
bolting
out
of
the
laboratory
and
keeled
me
over
i
came
out
pretty
indignant
apologise
not
at
all
he
just
sputtered
his
nearest
approach
to
coherence
seemed
to
indicate
a
desire
that
i
should
go
back
to
washington
at
once
and
destroy
a
perfectly
reputable
firm
of
chemists
finally
he
calmed
down
and
took
it
out
in
entering
it
in
his
daily
record
he
was
quite
proud
of
that
daily
record
and
remembered
to
write
in
it
on
an
average
of
once
a
week
then
the
chest
went
wrong
whether
it
had
rusted
a
bit
or
whether
the
chemicals
had
got
in
their
work
on
the
hinges
i
do
know
but
one
day
the
professor
of
his
own
initiative
recognised
my
existence
by
lugging
his
box
out
in
the
open
and
asking
me
to
fix
it
previously
he
had
emptied
it
it
was
rather
a
complicated
thing
with
an
inner
compartment
over
which
was
a
hollow
cover
opening
along
one
rim
that
i
conjectured
was
designed
to
hold
some
chemical
compound
or
salt
there
were
many
minor
openings
too
each
guarded
by
a
similar
hollow
door
my
business
was
with
the
heavy
top
cover
should
shut
and
open
softly
gently
explained
the
professor
not
he
added
with
his
curious
effect
of
linked
phraseology
half
a
day
work
fixed
it
the
lid
would
stand
open
of
itself
until
tipped
at
a
considerable
angle
when
it
would
fall
and
lock
only
on
the
outer
shell
was
there
a
lock
that
one
was
a
good
bit
of
craftsmanship
percy
my
boy
said
the
doctor
kindly
will
safety
guard
our
treasure
when
we
obtain
it
percy
when
it
shall
be
when
will
that
be
i
asked
knows
he
said
cheerfully
progresses
whenever
i
went
strolling
at
night
he
would
produce
his
curious
lights
sometimes
they
were
fairly
startling
one
fact
i
made
out
by
accident
looking
down
from
a
high
place
they
did
not
project
from
the
laboratory
he
always
worked
in
the
open
when
the
light
was
to
be
produced
once
the
experiment
took
a
serious
turn
the
lights
had
flickered
and
gone
schermerhorn
had
returned
to
his
laboratory
i
came
up
the
arroyo
as
he
flung
the
door
open
and
rushed
out
he
was
a
grotesque
figure
clad
in
an
undershirt
and
a
worn
pair
of
trousers
fastened
with
an
old
bit
of
tarred
rope
in
lieu
of
his
suspenders
which
i
had
been
repairing
about
his
waist
flickered
a
sort
of
aura
of
radiance
which
was
extinguished
as
he
flung
himself
headforemost
into
the
cold
spring
i
hauled
him
out
he
seemed
dazed
to
my
questions
he
replied
only
by
mumblings
the
burden
of
which
was
do
not
understand
it
is
a
accident
it
appears
that
he
did
quite
know
why
he
had
taken
to
the
water
or
if
he
did
he
did
want
to
tell
next
day
he
was
as
good
as
new
just
as
silent
as
before
but
it
was
a
smiling
satisfied
silence
so
it
went
for
weeks
for
months
with
the
accesses
of
depression
and
anger
always
rarer
then
came
an
afternoon
when
returning
from
a
stalk
after
sheep
i
heard
strange
and
shocking
noises
from
the
laboratory
strict
as
was
the
embargo
which
kept
me
outside
the
door
i
burst
in
only
to
be
seized
in
a
suffocating
grip
of
a
sudden
i
realised
that
i
was
being
embraced
the
doctor
flourished
a
hand
above
my
head
and
jigged
with
ponderous
steps
the
dismal
noises
continued
to
emanate
from
his
mouth
he
was
singing
i
wish
i
could
give
you
a
notion
of
the
amazement
the
paralysing
wonder
with
which
no
you
did
not
know
schermerhorn
you
would
not
understand
we
polkaed
into
the
open
there
he
cast
me
loose
he
stopped
singing
and
burst
into
a
rhapsody
of
disjointed
words
mostly
german
it
was
a
wondrous
jumble
of
the
scientific
and
poetic
occurred
at
intervals
then
he
would
leap
in
the
air
it
was
weird
it
was
distressing
crazy
oh
quite
for
the
time
you
understand
if
any
of
us
should
suddenly
become
the
most
potent
individual
in
the
world
he
be
apt
to
lose
balance
temporarily
one
must
make
allowances
there
was
excuse
for
the
doctor
he
had
reached
the
goal
you
shall
be
rewarded
he
said
haf
stuck
by
me
you
shall
haf
riches
gold
what
you
will
you
are
young
your
blood
runs
red
with
such
riches
nothing
is
beyond
you
you
could
the
explore
it
is
open
to
you
such
to
make
what
shall
it
be
scarabs
missals
prehistoric
implements
amuse
yourself
we
shall
be
able
to
pay
what
will
you
haf
i
said
i
like
a
vacation
if
convenient
he
replied
yet
remains
the
guardianship
to
be
perfected
then
we
return
we
celebrate
i
play
you
a
rubber
of
pinochle
we
played
with
the
greatest
secret
of
science
resting
at
our
elbows
we
played
the
doctor
won
my
mind
was
not
strictly
on
the
game
in
the
morning
the
doctor
sang
once
more
i
shall
never
hear
its
like
again
was
it
a
week
or
a
month
after
that
i
can
not
remember
i
fancy
i
was
excited
then
too
there
was
something
in
the
atmosphere
about
the
laboratory
i
do
know
imagination
possibly
once
we
had
a
little
manifestation
the
night
that
the
nigger
and
slade
were
terrified
by
the
rock
fires
days
of
excitement
and
pleasant
work
with
the
little
volcano
grumbling
more
sulkily
all
the
time
i
have
spent
worse
days
such
indifference
as
the
doctor
displayed
toward
the
volcano
i
have
never
known
if
i
ventured
to
warn
him
he
would
assure
me
that
there
was
no
cause
for
alarm
i
think
he
regarded
that
little
hell
kitchen
as
merely
a
for
his
vast
enterprise
he
felt
a
sort
of
affection
toward
it
he
was
tolerant
of
its
petty
fits
of
temper
that
he
completed
his
work
before
the
destruction
came
was
sheer
luck
nothing
else
the
day
before
the
outburst
he
came
to
me
with
a
tiny
phial
of
complicated
design
i
will
sell
this
to
you
he
said
much
i
inquired
responding
to
his
playfulness
bargain
he
cried
gaily
millions
dollars
no
shall
i
never
one
million
one
little
million
dollars
have
that
amount
with
me
i
began
no
account
he
declared
airily
we
shall
haf
many
more
times
as
that
gif
me
your
o
i
inquired
makes
no
matter
see
i
will
gif
it
to
you
gratis
he
handed
me
the
metal
contrivance
it
was
closed
iss
a
little
such
a
very
little
not
yet
iss
it
arranged
the
to
one
more
that
shall
require
but
the
other
phenomena
are
all
in
this
little
comprised
later
i
shall
tell
you
more
take
it
it
iss
without
price
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
the
love
of
friends
he
said
gently
feeling
in
his
upper
waistcoat
pocket
darrow
brought
out
a
phial
so
tiny
that
it
rolled
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
he
contemplated
it
lost
in
thought
radium
queried
barnett
with
the
keen
interest
of
the
scientist
god
knows
what
it
is
said
darrow
rousing
himself
not
the
perfected
product
the
doctor
said
that
when
he
gave
it
to
me
if
i
could
remember
of
what
he
told
me
that
night
it
is
like
a
disordered
dream
a
phantasmagoria
of
monstrous
powers
lit
up
with
an
intolerable
almost
an
infernal
radiance
this
much
i
did
gather
that
schermerhorn
had
achieved
what
the
greatest
minds
before
him
had
barely
outlined
yes
and
more
becquerel
the
curies
rutherford
they
were
playing
with
the
letters
of
the
greek
alphabet
alphas
gammas
and
rhos
while
the
simple
gentle
old
boy
that
i
served
had
read
the
secret
from
the
molten
eruptions
of
the
racked
earth
he
had
taken
gases
and
potencies
that
are
nameless
by
what
methods
of
combination
and
refining
i
do
not
know
he
produced
something
that
was
to
be
the
final
word
of
power
control
control
that
was
all
that
lacked
reduced
to
its
simplest
terms
it
meant
this
the
doctor
had
something
as
much
greater
than
radium
as
radium
is
greater
than
the
pitchblende
of
which
a
thousand
tons
are
melted
down
to
the
one
ounce
of
extract
and
the
incredible
energies
of
this
he
proposed
to
divide
into
departments
of
activity
one
manifestation
should
be
light
a
light
that
would
illuminate
the
world
another
was
to
make
motive
power
so
cheap
that
the
work
of
the
world
could
be
done
in
an
hour
out
of
the
day
some
idea
he
had
of
healing
properties
yes
he
was
to
cure
mankind
or
kill
kill
as
no
man
had
ever
killed
did
he
choose
the
armies
and
navies
of
the
powers
would
be
at
his
mercy
magnetism
was
to
be
his
slave
aerial
navigation
transmutation
of
metals
the
screening
of
gravity
does
this
sound
like
delirium
sometimes
i
think
it
was
that
night
he
turned
over
to
me
the
key
of
the
large
chest
and
his
ledger
the
latter
he
bade
me
read
it
was
a
complete
jumble
you
have
seen
it
we
were
up
a
good
part
of
the
night
with
our
pet
volcano
it
was
suffering
from
internal
disturbances
the
doctor
would
say
indulgently
when
a
particularly
active
rock
came
bounding
down
our
way
now
that
the
work
iss
finished
in
the
morning
he
insisted
on
my
leaving
him
alone
and
going
down
to
give
the
orders
i
took
the
ledger
intending
to
send
it
aboard
it
saved
my
life
possibly
solomon
bullet
deflected
slightly
i
think
in
passing
through
the
heavy
paper
slade
has
told
you
about
my
flight
i
ought
to
have
gone
straight
up
the
arroyo
yet
i
could
hardly
have
made
it
i
did
not
see
him
again
the
doctor
my
last
glimpse
the
old
man
i
remember
now
how
the
grey
had
spread
through
his
beard
he
was
growing
old
it
had
been
ageing
labour
he
stood
there
at
his
laboratory
door
and
the
mountain
spouted
and
thundered
behind
will
a
gif
it
he
said
as
i
left
him
shall
make
us
as
the
gods
we
will
call
it
celestium
i
left
him
there
smiling
smiling
happily
the
greatest
force
of
his
age
if
he
had
lived
very
wise
very
simple
a
kind
old
child
may
i
trouble
you
for
a
light
thanks
x
the
doom
nothing
remained
but
to
search
for
his
body
i
was
sure
they
had
killed
him
and
taken
the
chest
i
had
little
expectation
of
finding
him
dead
or
alive
none
after
i
saw
the
stream
of
lava
pouring
into
the
sea
one
saves
his
own
life
by
instinct
i
suppose
there
i
was
i
had
to
live
it
did
not
matter
much
but
i
continued
to
do
it
by
various
shifts
that
last
day
on
the
headland
the
fumes
nearly
got
me
you
may
have
noted
the
rather
excited
scrawl
in
the
back
of
the
ledger
yes
i
thought
i
was
gone
that
time
but
i
got
to
the
cave
it
was
low
tide
then
the
earthquake
and
i
was
walled
in
barnett
very
accurate
explosives
insistence
your
risking
your
lives
as
you
did
mites
on
the
crust
of
a
cheese
i
hope
you
know
how
i
feel
about
it
all
one
ca
thank
a
man
properly
for
the
life
oh
the
pirates
necessarily
it
must
be
a
matter
of
theory
but
i
think
we
have
it
right
slade
and
i
built
it
up
for
what
it
worth
here
it
is
let
me
see
you
sighted
the
glow
on
the
night
of
the
next
day
came
the
deserted
ship
it
must
have
puzzled
you
outrageously
it
did
said
captain
parkinson
drily
not
an
easy
problem
even
with
all
the
data
at
hand
you
of
course
had
none
on
slade
showing
handy
solomon
and
his
worthy
associates
thought
they
had
a
chest
full
of
riches
when
they
got
the
doctor
treasure
believed
they
owned
the
machinery
for
making
diamonds
or
gold
or
of
wealth
it
fair
to
assume
a
certain
eagerness
on
their
part
disturbed
weather
keeps
them
busy
until
they
well
out
from
the
island
then
to
the
chest
opening
it
is
so
easy
i
had
the
key
you
know
he
brought
a
curious
and
delicately
wrought
skeleton
from
his
pocket
tipped
with
platinum
he
observed
rather
a
gem
of
a
key
i
think
you
see
there
must
have
been
some
action
even
through
the
keyhole
or
he
would
have
used
a
metal
of
this
kind
but
the
crew
was
rich
in
certain
qualities
it
seems
which
i
failed
stupidly
to
recognise
in
my
acquaintance
with
them
both
pulz
and
perdosa
appear
to
have
been
handy
men
where
locks
were
concerned
first
pulz
sneaks
down
and
has
his
turn
at
the
chest
he
gets
it
open
small
profit
for
him
in
that
the
next
we
know
of
him
he
is
scandalising
handy
solomon
by
having
a
fit
on
the
deck
that
is
what
i
could
figure
out
to
save
my
life
said
slade
eagerly
if
you
recollect
i
told
you
of
the
professor
plunge
in
the
cold
spring
in
a
sort
of
paroxysm
one
day
said
darrow
that
was
the
physiological
action
of
the
celestium
at
other
times
i
have
seen
him
come
out
and
deliberately
roll
in
the
creek
head
under
once
he
explained
that
the
medium
he
worked
in
caused
a
kind
of
uncontrollable
longing
for
water
something
having
none
of
the
qualities
of
burning
or
thirst
but
an
irresistible
temporary
mania
it
worried
him
a
good
deal
he
understand
it
that
then
was
what
ailed
pulz
when
he
opened
the
chest
there
was
as
i
surmise
a
trifling
quantity
of
this
stuff
lying
in
the
inner
lid
it
was
the
celestium
itself
as
i
imagine
but
a
sort
of
product
with
the
physiological
and
radiant
effects
of
the
real
thing
and
it
had
been
set
there
on
guard
a
discouragement
to
the
spirit
of
investigation
as
it
were
so
when
the
top
was
lifted
our
little
guardian
gets
in
its
work
producing
the
light
phenomenon
that
so
puzzled
slade
and
inspiring
pulz
with
a
passion
for
the
rolling
wave
which
is
only
interrupted
by
handy
solomon
tackling
him
as
he
fled
he
must
have
pulled
down
the
cover
he
did
said
slade
i
heard
the
clang
but
i
saw
the
radiance
on
the
clouds
and
the
whole
thickness
of
a
solid
oak
deck
was
in
between
the
sky
and
the
chest
oh
a
little
thing
like
an
oak
deck
would
interrupt
the
kind
of
rays
the
doctor
used
he
had
his
own
method
of
screening
you
understand
however
this
inconsiderable
guardian
affair
must
have
used
itself
up
which
true
celestium
would
have
done
so
when
perdosa
sets
his
genius
for
to
the
task
the
inner
box
full
of
the
genuine
article
has
no
warning
so
to
speak
everything
peaceful
until
they
raise
the
hollow
layer
of
the
inner
cover
which
serves
to
interrupt
the
action
then
comes
the
general
exit
and
the
superior
fireworks
that
when
the
rays
ran
through
the
ship
said
slade
it
seemed
to
follow
the
the
stuff
had
a
strange
affinity
for
tar
said
darrow
i
told
you
of
the
circle
of
fire
about
professor
schermerhorn
waist
the
day
he
gave
me
such
a
scare
that
was
the
celestium
working
on
the
tarred
rope
he
wore
for
a
belt
it
made
a
livid
circle
on
his
skin
did
i
tell
you
of
his
experiments
with
pitch
it
does
matter
where
was
i
at
the
place
where
we
all
jumped
said
slade
oh
yes
and
you
dove
into
the
small
boat
trying
to
reach
the
water
wait
a
bit
said
barnett
if
that
was
the
exhibition
of
radiance
we
saw
it
died
out
in
a
few
minutes
how
was
that
did
they
close
the
chest
before
they
ran
probably
not
replied
darrow
slade
spoke
of
pulz
taking
to
the
maintop
and
being
shaken
out
by
the
sudden
shock
of
a
wave
that
may
have
been
a
volcanic
billow
whatever
it
was
it
undoubtedly
heeled
the
ship
sufficiently
to
bring
down
both
lids
which
were
rather
delicately
balanced
yes
for
billy
edwards
found
the
chest
closed
and
locked
said
barnett
of
course
it
was
a
spring
lock
you
sent
edwards
and
his
men
aboard
no
such
experts
as
pulz
or
perdosa
were
in
your
crew
consequently
it
took
longer
to
get
the
chest
open
when
at
length
the
lid
was
raised
there
was
a
repetition
of
the
tragedy
edwards
and
his
men
leaped
probably
they
were
paralysed
almost
before
they
struck
the
water
your
whom
slade
picked
up
was
the
only
one
who
had
time
even
to
grab
a
life
preserver
before
the
impulse
toward
water
became
irresistible
there
was
no
element
of
fright
you
understand
no
desertion
of
their
post
they
were
dragged
as
by
the
sweep
of
a
tornado
darrow
spoke
direct
to
captain
parkinson
if
there
is
any
feeling
among
you
other
than
sorrow
for
their
death
it
is
unjust
and
unworthy
thank
you
darrow
returned
the
captain
quietly
we
found
the
chest
closed
again
when
the
empty
ship
came
back
observed
barnett
being
masterless
the
schooner
began
to
yaw
continued
darrow
the
first
time
she
came
about
would
have
heeled
her
enough
to
shut
the
chest
now
came
the
turn
of
your
other
men
ives
and
mcguire
said
the
captain
as
darrow
paused
the
glow
came
again
that
night
and
the
next
day
we
picked
up
slade
said
barnett
you
know
what
the
glow
meant
for
your
companions
said
darrow
but
the
ship
the
man
she
vanished
no
one
has
seen
her
since
you
are
wrong
there
said
darrow
i
have
seen
her
in
a
common
impulse
the
little
circle
leaned
to
him
yes
i
have
seen
her
i
wish
i
had
not
let
me
bring
my
story
back
to
the
cave
on
the
island
after
the
volcanic
gases
had
driven
me
to
the
refuge
i
sat
near
the
mouth
of
the
cave
looking
out
into
the
darkness
that
was
the
night
of
the
the
night
you
saw
the
last
glow
it
was
very
dark
except
for
occasional
bursts
of
fire
from
the
crater
judge
of
my
incredulous
amazement
when
in
an
access
of
this
illumination
i
saw
plainly
a
schooner
hardly
a
mile
off
shore
coming
in
under
bare
poles
under
bare
poles
cried
slade
the
halliards
must
have
disintegrated
from
some
slow
action
of
the
celestium
it
could
be
destructive
terrifically
destructive
you
shall
judge
there
was
the
schooner
naked
as
your
hand
possibly
i
might
have
thought
it
a
hallucination
but
for
what
came
after
darkness
fell
again
i
supposed
then
that
handy
solomon
crew
were
managing
or
mismanaging
the
without
the
aid
of
their
leader
whom
i
had
satisfactorily
buried
i
hoped
they
would
come
ashore
on
the
rocks
yes
i
was
vengeful
then
of
a
sudden
there
sprang
from
the
darkness
a
ship
of
light
you
have
all
seen
those
great
electric
effects
at
expositions
someone
touches
a
button
you
know
it
was
like
that
only
that
the
piercingly
brilliant
jewelled
wonder
of
a
ship
was
set
in
the
midst
of
a
swirl
of
radiance
such
as
i
ca
begin
to
describe
you
saw
it
from
a
distance
imagine
what
it
was
coming
close
upon
you
that
way
dead
on
out
of
the
night
a
living
glory
a
living
terror
his
voice
sank
with
a
shaking
hand
he
fumbled
amid
his
cigarette
papers
it
came
on
a
human
figure
glowing
like
a
diamond
ablaze
leaped
out
from
it
another
shot
down
from
the
foremast
i
do
know
how
many
i
saw
go
it
was
like
a
theatric
effect
unreal
unconvincing
incredible
the
end
fitted
it
darrow
eye
roved
it
fell
upon
a
quaintly
modelled
ship
hung
above
the
door
what
that
he
cried
fool
thing
some
malay
gave
me
grunted
trendon
pretended
to
be
grateful
because
i
cut
his
foot
off
no
good
go
on
with
the
story
no
good
you
do
care
what
happens
to
it
meant
to
heave
it
overboard
before
now
growled
the
other
someone
handed
it
down
to
darrow
if
i
had
something
to
hold
enough
water
muttered
he
i
like
to
float
it
i
like
to
see
for
myself
how
it
worked
out
i
like
to
see
that
in
action
he
spoke
feverishly
boy
fill
the
portable
rubber
tub
in
forsythe
cabin
and
bring
it
here
ordered
the
captain
that
will
do
said
darrow
recovering
himself
he
floated
the
model
in
the
tub
now
i
do
know
how
this
will
come
out
he
said
nor
do
i
know
why
the
met
her
fate
under
ives
and
mcguire
and
not
before
perhaps
the
chest
lay
open
longer
long
enough
anyway
we
try
it
from
his
pocket
he
took
a
curious
small
phial
is
that
what
schermerhorn
gave
you
asked
slade
yes
said
darrow
he
set
it
carefully
inside
the
little
model
and
slipped
a
lever
slade
quietly
turned
down
the
light
a
faint
glow
shot
up
it
grew
bright
and
eddied
in
lovely
variant
colours
as
if
set
to
a
powder
train
it
ran
through
the
ship
the
pale
faces
of
the
spectators
shone
ghastly
in
its
radiance
from
someone
burst
a
sudden
gasp
there
is
not
enough
for
danger
said
darrow
quietly
as
a
point
of
interest
grunted
trendon
everyone
looked
at
his
outstretched
hand
a
little
pocket
compass
lay
in
the
palm
the
needle
spun
madly
projecting
blue
vivid
sparklings
my
god
cried
slade
and
covered
his
eyes
for
a
moment
he
snatched
away
his
hands
as
a
suppressed
cry
went
up
from
the
others
as
i
expected
said
darrow
quietly
the
little
craft
opened
out
it
disintegrated
all
that
radiance
dissolved
and
with
its
going
the
substance
upon
which
it
shaped
itself
vanished
the
last
glow
showed
a
formless
pulp
spreading
upon
the
water
so
passed
the
said
darrow
solemnly
and
the
chest
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
said
barnett
good
place
for
it
muttered
trendon
in
all
probability
it
closed
as
the
ship
dissolved
around
it
said
darrow
otherwise
we
should
see
the
effects
in
the
water
it
might
be
recovered
cried
slade
excitedly
could
you
chart
it
darrow
think
of
the
possibilities
let
it
lie
said
the
captain
has
it
not
cost
enough
let
it
lie
the
water
in
the
tub
fumed
and
sparkled
faintly
and
was
still
darkness
fell
except
where
darrow
cigarette
point
glowed
and
faded
the
end
