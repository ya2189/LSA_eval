chapter
i
headpiece
very
strange
rescue
a
shout
of
laughter
rang
through
the
kitchen
and
went
echoing
up
the
great
chimney
when
much
more
in
fun
than
in
earnest
i
hinted
that
if
they
could
not
manage
to
kill
the
bear
themselves
i
would
have
to
do
it
for
them
now
it
was
no
new
thing
for
me
to
be
laughed
at
my
big
brothers
were
only
too
fond
of
that
amusement
and
i
had
got
pretty
well
used
to
it
but
this
time
i
detected
a
particularly
derisive
tone
in
their
hilarity
which
touched
me
to
the
quick
and
springing
to
my
feet
with
eyes
flashing
and
cheeks
burning
i
burst
out
hotly
i
care
how
much
you
laugh
as
sure
as
standing
here
put
a
bullet
in
that
bear
before
this
time
night
at
this
they
only
laughed
the
louder
and
filled
the
room
with
sarcastic
shouts
of
hurrah
for
the
bantam
bet
on
the
bear
what
will
you
take
for
his
skin
bantam
until
father
silenced
them
with
one
of
his
reproving
looks
and
drew
me
to
him
saying
soothingly
mind
the
boys
walter
and
let
your
temper
betray
you
into
making
rash
vows
that
you
can
not
keep
i
sat
down
in
the
sulks
and
soon
after
skipped
off
to
bed
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
got
to
sleep
for
my
brain
was
in
a
whirl
and
my
blood
coursing
through
my
veins
like
fire
i
was
the
youngest
in
a
family
of
six
sturdy
boys
and
consequently
came
in
for
much
more
than
a
fair
share
as
i
thought
of
ridicule
from
my
big
brothers
they
were
all
fond
enough
of
me
and
generally
very
kind
to
me
too
but
they
had
a
notion
and
perhaps
not
altogether
a
mistaken
one
that
i
was
inclined
to
think
too
much
of
myself
and
they
took
great
pleasure
in
putting
me
down
as
they
were
pleased
to
call
it
of
course
i
did
my
best
not
to
be
put
down
and
they
had
nicknamed
me
the
bantam
as
a
sort
of
compliment
to
my
fiery
opposition
against
being
put
down
i
was
rather
small
for
my
age
and
they
could
easily
beat
me
in
nearly
all
the
trials
of
skill
and
strength
country
boys
delighted
quite
all
however
for
much
to
my
pride
and
satisfaction
i
could
hit
the
chalked
out
on
the
big
twice
as
often
as
the
best
of
them
and
no
small
comfort
did
my
skill
in
shooting
give
me
but
this
far
from
contented
me
and
in
my
foolish
feverish
haste
to
get
on
a
level
with
those
big
fellows
i
was
constantly
attempting
all
sort
of
reckless
daring
feats
that
called
forth
my
grave
reproof
and
my
loving
entreaties
time
and
again
would
father
say
to
me
walter
your
rashness
will
be
the
death
of
you
some
day
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
be
a
man
before
quit
being
a
boy
but
reproof
and
entreaty
alike
went
unheeded
and
that
night
as
i
tossed
restlessly
about
in
bed
i
made
solemn
vows
to
the
stars
peeping
in
through
the
window
that
next
morning
i
would
take
tiger
and
go
off
alone
after
the
huge
black
bear
which
had
been
prowling
around
the
sheepfold
lately
and
which
father
and
the
boys
had
twice
hunted
in
vain
soothed
by
the
prospect
of
the
glory
success
would
bring
me
i
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
that
armed
only
with
my
i
was
chasing
hard
after
the
bear
which
seemed
half
as
big
as
the
barn
yet
ran
away
in
the
most
flattering
fashion
next
morning
all
my
temper
had
vanished
and
so
much
of
my
valour
had
vanished
with
it
that
my
would
never
have
probably
got
beyond
dreamland
had
not
jack
the
moment
i
appeared
called
out
mockingly
behold
the
mighty
hunter
make
way
for
bantam
the
renowned
the
chorus
of
laughter
that
greeted
this
sally
set
me
in
a
blaze
again
but
this
time
i
held
my
tongue
and
the
teasing
soon
stopped
the
mischief
was
done
however
i
felt
as
though
i
would
rather
die
than
go
back
on
my
word
now
never
before
in
my
life
had
i
been
stirred
so
deeply
determined
to
keep
my
purpose
secret
i
waited
about
the
house
until
all
the
others
had
gone
off
then
quietly
taking
down
my
gun
i
put
biscuits
in
my
pocket
and
with
and
slipped
off
unobserved
towards
the
forest
tiger
following
close
at
my
heels
tiger
was
my
own
present
from
a
city
uncle
after
whom
i
had
been
named
he
was
half
half
and
seemed
to
combine
the
best
qualities
of
both
breeds
so
that
for
sense
strength
and
courage
his
superior
could
not
be
found
of
his
size
my
affection
for
him
was
surpassed
only
by
his
devotion
to
me
he
acknowledged
no
other
master
and
fairly
lived
in
the
light
of
my
countenance
this
morning
he
evidently
caught
from
my
face
some
inkling
of
the
serious
nature
of
our
business
for
instead
of
bounding
and
barking
about
me
in
his
wonted
way
he
trotted
gravely
along
at
my
side
every
now
and
then
looking
up
into
my
face
as
though
about
to
say
here
i
am
ready
for
anything
and
where
could
i
have
found
a
trustier
ally
it
was
a
glorious
day
in
december
a
week
of
intense
cold
had
been
succeeded
by
a
few
days
of
milder
weather
and
over
all
the
trees
the
frost
had
thrown
a
fairy
garb
of
white
that
sparkled
brightly
in
the
morning
sun
the
air
was
just
cold
enough
to
be
bracing
the
spotless
snow
crunched
crisply
under
my
feet
as
i
walked
rapidly
over
it
and
my
spirits
rose
with
every
step
soon
i
had
climbed
the
hill
pasture
and
with
one
look
backward
at
my
dear
old
home
nestling
among
its
beeches
and
poplars
in
the
plain
below
i
plunged
into
the
dense
undergrowth
that
bordered
the
vast
canadian
forest
which
stretched
away
inland
for
many
a
mile
the
snow
lay
pretty
deep
in
the
woods
but
my
snowshoes
made
the
walking
easy
everywhere
across
the
white
surface
ran
the
interlacing
tracks
of
rabbits
and
red
foxes
with
here
and
there
the
broader
deeper
print
of
the
wild
cat
for
it
had
been
a
long
hard
winter
and
the
wild
animals
desperate
with
hunger
were
drawing
uncomfortably
close
to
the
settled
districts
as
i
pushed
on
into
the
lonely
silent
forest
its
shadows
began
to
cool
my
ardour
and
the
inclination
to
turn
back
strengthened
every
moment
so
that
my
pride
had
hard
work
to
keep
my
courage
up
to
the
mark
presently
i
came
to
an
open
glade
almost
circular
and
about
fifty
yards
across
walled
in
on
all
sides
by
tall
dark
pines
and
sombre
hemlocks
it
was
so
pleasant
to
be
in
full
view
of
the
sun
again
that
i
halted
on
the
verge
of
this
glade
to
rest
a
little
leaning
against
a
huge
pine
and
letting
the
sunshine
pour
down
upon
me
although
my
long
walk
had
started
the
perspiration
from
every
pore
tiger
who
had
been
carefully
scrutinizing
every
but
following
up
none
as
he
saw
i
evidently
was
not
after
small
game
that
day
now
bounded
off
along
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
i
watched
him
proudly
as
with
nose
close
to
the
snow
and
tail
high
in
the
air
he
ran
hither
and
thither
the
very
picture
of
canine
beauty
and
intelligence
suddenly
he
stopped
short
snuffed
fiercely
at
a
track
in
the
snow
and
then
with
sharp
eager
barks
that
sounded
like
a
succession
of
and
startled
every
nerve
and
fibre
in
my
body
into
intense
excitement
sprang
over
the
snow
with
mad
haste
until
he
brought
up
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
just
opposite
me
on
the
other
side
of
the
glade
for
some
moments
i
stood
as
if
i
felt
that
nothing
less
than
a
could
have
put
tiger
in
such
a
quiver
perhaps
he
had
struck
the
track
of
the
bear
about
whose
immense
size
father
and
the
boys
had
talked
so
much
i
confess
that
at
the
thought
my
knees
trembled
my
tongue
parched
as
though
with
hot
thirst
and
i
stood
there
utterly
irresolute
until
all
at
once
like
a
great
wave
my
courage
came
back
to
me
the
hunter
instinct
rose
supreme
over
human
weakness
and
grasping
my
gun
tightly
i
hurried
across
to
where
the
dog
was
still
barking
furiously
a
bare
blasted
stood
out
gaunt
and
gray
in
marked
contrast
to
the
dark
masses
of
the
pine
and
hemlock
around
it
was
plainly
the
ruin
of
a
magnificent
pine
which
once
had
towered
high
above
its
fellows
and
then
paid
the
penalty
of
its
by
being
first
selected
as
a
target
for
the
lightning
only
some
twenty
feet
of
its
former
grandeur
remained
and
this
poor
decapitated
stub
was
evidently
hollow
and
rotten
to
the
roots
for
deeply
scored
upon
its
barkless
sides
were
the
signs
of
its
being
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
admirably
chosen
of
some
sagacious
bruin
my
gun
was
loaded
with
an
extra
charge
of
powder
and
two
good
bullets
i
put
on
a
fresh
cap
made
sure
everything
was
in
good
order
and
took
my
stand
a
few
yards
off
from
the
tree
to
await
the
result
of
audacious
challenge
minute
after
minute
crept
slowly
by
but
not
a
sound
came
from
the
tree
the
tension
of
nerve
was
extreme
at
length
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
if
the
bear
was
really
inside
the
i
must
know
it
immediately
looking
up
i
noticed
that
an
adjoining
hemlock
sent
out
a
long
arm
right
over
the
hollow
trunk
while
a
little
above
was
another
branch
by
which
i
could
steady
myself
taking
off
my
and
laying
my
gun
at
the
foot
i
climbed
quickly
up
tiger
for
a
time
suspending
his
barking
in
order
to
look
inquiringly
after
me
reaching
the
branch
which
seemed
strong
enough
for
anything
i
walked
out
on
it
carefully
balancing
myself
by
the
one
above
my
moccasined
feet
giving
me
a
good
foothold
until
i
was
right
over
the
deep
mysterious
cavity
i
peered
eagerly
in
but
of
course
saw
nothing
save
darkness
as
of
egypt
and
half
laughing
at
my
own
folly
had
turned
to
retrace
my
steps
when
suddenly
without
the
slightest
warning
the
bough
on
which
i
stood
snapped
short
off
a
few
feet
from
the
trunk
for
one
harrowing
instant
i
clung
to
the
slender
branch
above
and
then
it
slipping
swiftly
through
my
fingers
with
a
wild
shriek
of
terror
i
plunged
feet
foremost
into
the
awful
abyss
beneath
just
grazing
the
rim
of
the
open
mouth
i
fell
sheer
to
the
bottom
bringing
up
with
such
a
shock
that
the
fright
and
fall
combined
rendered
me
insensible
how
long
i
lay
there
i
can
not
say
when
i
did
come
to
myself
my
first
impulse
was
to
stand
up
and
words
can
not
express
my
relief
when
i
found
that
although
much
shaken
up
no
bones
were
broken
thanks
to
the
accumulation
of
rotten
wood
at
the
bottom
of
this
strange
well
but
oh
what
a
fearful
situation
was
mine
and
how
bitterly
i
reproached
myself
for
my
folly
shut
up
in
the
heart
of
that
hollow
tree
four
long
miles
from
home
and
help
utterly
unable
to
extricate
myself
for
the
soft
decayed
sides
of
my
prison
forbade
all
attempts
at
ascent
only
a
few
biscuits
in
my
pocket
not
a
drop
of
water
and
already
i
was
suffering
with
thirst
and
to
crown
all
the
possibility
ay
the
certainty
of
the
bear
returning
in
a
few
hours
while
i
had
no
other
weapon
of
defence
than
the
knife
which
hung
at
my
belt
although
it
was
now
intense
darkness
filled
my
prison
cell
and
the
air
was
close
and
foul
for
bruin
had
evidently
been
tenant
of
the
place
all
winter
for
some
time
i
could
do
nothing
but
gaze
at
the
little
patch
of
blue
sky
above
me
that
seemed
so
hopelessly
far
away
as
if
rescue
must
soon
come
from
thence
i
could
faintly
hear
poor
barking
still
and
fearing
he
might
go
off
in
search
of
me
i
kicked
and
pounded
against
the
sides
of
the
tree
shouting
at
the
top
of
my
voice
i
know
whether
he
could
hear
me
but
he
did
not
go
away
at
all
events
it
would
have
been
far
better
for
him
poor
fellow
if
he
had
after
some
minutes
the
first
bewildering
paroxysm
of
fright
abated
and
i
set
myself
seriously
to
consider
what
was
to
be
done
i
could
not
give
up
all
hope
of
escape
desperate
as
my
case
seemed
and
i
felt
sure
i
would
lose
my
mind
if
i
did
not
keep
myself
constantly
employed
in
some
way
there
seemed
but
one
thing
to
do
and
to
that
i
forthwith
applied
myself
in
my
belt
hung
my
strong
since
i
could
not
climb
out
of
my
prison
perhaps
i
could
cut
my
way
out
so
drawing
the
knife
i
set
to
work
with
tremendous
vigour
at
first
it
was
easy
enough
for
the
soft
decayed
wood
offered
little
opposition
to
my
keen
blade
and
i
felt
encouraged
but
presently
i
reached
the
hard
rind
and
then
had
to
go
warily
for
fear
of
snapping
the
steel
off
short
the
close
confinement
the
heavy
poisonous
air
and
the
constrained
position
the
work
required
all
told
hard
upon
me
but
i
toiled
away
with
the
determination
of
despair
i
must
have
spent
at
least
an
hour
thus
when
to
my
delight
a
hard
blow
sent
the
clean
through
the
wood
and
on
drawing
it
back
a
blessed
little
bit
of
daylight
peeped
through
which
made
a
new
man
of
me
at
it
i
went
again
and
paused
not
this
time
until
i
had
a
jagged
hole
chipped
out
through
which
i
could
put
my
hand
if
the
bear
did
not
come
for
a
couple
of
hours
more
i
would
be
free
the
moment
i
put
out
my
hand
tiger
caught
sight
of
it
and
came
leaping
up
against
the
tree
wild
with
delight
at
finding
me
again
for
now
of
course
i
could
easily
make
him
hear
iny
voice
a
few
rest
and
the
breathing
of
the
pure
fresh
air
that
streamed
in
through
the
opening
and
chip
chip
chip
i
cut
away
at
the
hard
wood
until
a
hole
as
big
as
my
face
was
made
another
brief
rest
for
i
was
getting
very
tired
what
is
the
matter
why
is
tiger
barking
so
madly
can
it
be
that
the
bear
is
returning
yes
there
he
comes
he
was
across
the
glade
already
and
tiger
trembling
with
rage
was
right
below
me
at
the
root
of
the
tree
ready
to
defend
me
to
the
death
growling
fiercely
the
huge
brute
shambled
rapidly
toward
us
another
minute
and
tiger
the
dauntless
sprang
at
his
throat
but
the
bear
was
too
quick
for
him
and
with
one
sweep
of
his
great
sent
his
puny
opponent
rolling
over
on
the
snow
illustration
in
a
few
seconds
we
were
at
the
top
little
hurt
and
much
wiser
for
this
rebuff
the
dog
attacked
from
behind
and
bit
so
sharp
and
quick
that
bruin
in
reared
up
on
his
hind
legs
ready
to
wheel
round
and
drop
on
the
dog
at
the
first
opportunity
for
minutes
which
seemed
hours
the
unequal
contest
went
on
before
my
straining
eyes
more
than
once
the
bear
in
sheer
disgust
at
his
inability
to
crush
his
agile
adversary
attempted
to
climb
the
tree
and
my
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
as
his
claws
rattled
against
the
wood
but
the
instant
he
turned
his
back
tiger
had
his
sharp
fangs
deep
into
his
hams
and
with
a
fierce
snarl
down
he
dropped
to
renew
the
conflict
the
afternoon
shades
were
lengthening
now
and
a
new
hope
dawned
within
me
my
mother
had
ere
this
grown
anxious
at
my
long
absence
from
home
and
perhaps
my
father
and
brothers
were
even
then
tracing
me
through
the
forest
by
my
track
they
would
hear
furious
yelps
if
they
were
anywhere
within
a
mile
of
us
if
my
noble
dog
could
hold
out
long
enough
we
should
both
be
saved
full
of
this
hope
i
cheered
him
vigorously
and
seeming
to
be
as
tireless
as
fearless
the
little
hero
kept
up
the
fight
they
were
both
before
me
now
in
full
view
and
i
could
watch
every
movement
the
scene
would
have
been
ludicrous
if
my
life
had
not
hung
upon
its
bear
was
so
clumsy
and
awkward
the
dog
so
quick
and
clever
as
it
was
i
almost
forgot
my
anxiety
in
my
excitement
when
with
a
thrill
of
horror
i
saw
that
sharp
teeth
had
caught
in
the
shaggy
fur
and
he
could
not
free
himself
the
bear
wheeled
swiftly
round
upon
him
one
instant
more
and
the
huge
pitiless
jaws
had
him
in
their
grasp
at
last
there
was
an
awful
moment
of
silence
then
a
quick
cry
a
harsh
exultant
roar
and
out
of
that
fatal
embrace
my
brave
faithful
dog
dropped
to
the
ground
a
limp
lifeless
mass
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
my
dog
at
first
and
in
frantic
futile
rage
i
beat
against
the
obdurate
walls
of
my
prison
while
the
bear
sniffed
curiously
at
his
victim
turned
him
about
with
his
great
paws
and
seemed
to
be
exulting
over
the
brave
spirit
he
had
conquered
but
when
having
satisfied
his
pride
the
brute
turned
to
climb
the
tree
all
my
thoughts
centred
upon
myself
for
i
felt
that
my
hour
had
come
i
could
feel
his
claws
scraping
against
the
outside
as
wearied
with
his
exertion
he
climbed
slowly
up
there
was
nothing
for
me
but
to
wait
his
coming
and
then
sell
my
life
as
dearly
as
possible
firmly
grasping
my
knife
whose
keenness
had
alas
been
spent
upon
the
tough
wood
and
feeling
as
though
the
bitterness
of
death
were
already
past
i
stood
awaiting
my
fate
watching
closely
the
narrow
opening
at
the
top
i
noticed
that
the
bear
was
descending
tail
foremost
foot
by
foot
he
came
slowly
down
striking
his
long
sharp
claws
deep
into
the
spongy
wood
his
huge
bulk
completely
filling
the
passage
not
a
movement
or
a
sound
did
i
make
all
at
once
as
if
by
it
in
answer
to
my
poor
prayer
idea
flashed
into
my
brain
at
which
i
grasped
as
a
drowning
man
might
grasp
at
a
straw
the
bear
was
now
close
at
my
head
i
waited
until
he
had
descended
one
step
more
then
reaching
up
both
hands
and
taking
a
firm
grip
of
his
soft
yielding
fur
i
shouted
at
the
top
of
my
voice
for
one
harrowing
moment
the
bear
paused
as
though
paralyzed
heaven
help
me
if
he
drops
i
thought
then
with
a
wild
spring
he
started
upward
dragging
me
after
him
putting
forth
all
his
vast
strength
he
scrambled
with
incredible
speed
straight
up
that
hollow
shaft
i
holding
on
like
grim
death
and
giving
all
the
help
i
could
in
a
few
seconds
we
were
at
the
top
and
with
a
joy
beyond
all
describing
i
emerged
into
daylight
no
sooner
did
the
bear
reach
the
rim
than
he
swung
himself
over
and
plunged
headlong
downwards
without
an
pause
at
that
moment
i
let
go
and
tried
to
make
the
descent
more
slowly
but
the
reaction
was
too
great
my
senses
deserted
me
and
i
tumbled
in
a
heap
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
in
that
condition
my
father
found
me
just
before
sunset
and
although
the
deep
snow
had
rendered
my
fall
harmless
the
strain
and
shock
told
so
heavily
upon
me
that
many
weeks
passed
before
i
was
myself
again
and
i
am
not
likely
to
ever
forget
the
very
strange
way
in
which
i
was
rescued
by
a
bear
blessing
in
stern
disguise
bruno
home
was
in
about
as
lonely
and
unattractive
a
spot
as
one
could
well
imagine
an
unpleasant
fact
the
force
of
which
nobody
felt
more
keenly
than
did
bruno
himself
for
he
was
of
a
very
sociable
disposition
and
delighted
in
companionship
but
besides
his
father
and
mother
companions
he
had
none
except
his
collie
steeltrap
who
had
been
given
that
name
because
of
his
sharpness
and
who
recognized
no
other
master
than
bruno
to
whom
he
was
unflaggingly
devoted
to
find
the
perry
house
was
no
easy
task
for
it
lay
away
off
from
the
main
road
on
a
little
road
of
its
own
that
was
hardly
better
than
a
donald
perry
was
a
very
strange
man
he
was
moody
and
taciturn
by
nature
and
much
given
to
brooding
over
real
or
fancied
wrongs
some
years
ago
he
had
owned
a
fine
farm
not
far
from
riverton
but
owing
to
a
succession
of
disputes
with
his
neighbours
about
and
other
matters
he
had
in
a
fit
of
anger
disposed
of
his
farm
and
banished
himself
and
his
family
to
the
wilderness
where
he
had
purchased
for
a
mere
trifle
the
abandoned
clearing
of
a
poor
little
bruno
at
that
time
only
ten
years
old
cried
bitterly
as
they
turned
their
backs
upon
the
pleasant
home
which
he
had
come
to
love
so
dearly
and
his
mother
joined
her
tears
with
his
but
his
father
was
not
to
be
moved
from
his
purpose
he
had
not
much
faith
in
or
sympathy
for
other
feelings
or
notions
as
he
contemptuously
called
them
the
only
notice
he
took
of
his
wife
and
son
in
the
matter
was
to
gruffly
bid
them
stop
blubbering
and
they
both
knew
him
too
well
not
to
do
their
best
to
obey
that
was
full
five
years
ago
and
in
all
this
time
neither
bruno
nor
his
mother
had
had
any
other
society
than
their
own
except
an
occasional
or
who
might
beg
the
favour
of
a
lodging
if
he
happened
to
find
the
after
sundown
oh
mother
are
we
always
to
live
in
this
dreadful
place
exclaimed
bruno
one
day
when
he
knew
his
father
to
be
well
out
of
hearing
sure
go
clean
crazy
if
i
get
out
of
it
soon
father
will
have
it
that
i
must
learn
to
run
the
farm
so
as
to
take
hold
when
he
gives
up
but
never
be
a
backwoods
farmer
rather
die
first
hush
hush
my
boy
said
perry
in
gentle
reproof
you
must
not
talk
that
way
you
mean
what
you
say
yes
i
do
every
word
of
it
replied
bruno
vehemently
run
away
if
father
let
me
go
with
his
consent
and
what
would
mother
do
without
the
light
of
her
life
asked
perry
tenderly
taking
her
curly
head
in
both
her
hands
and
giving
him
a
fond
kiss
on
the
forehead
bruno
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
exclaimed
petulantly
why
you
come
too
mother
ah
no
boy
was
the
gentle
response
i
will
never
leave
my
husband
even
though
my
boy
should
leave
me
but
be
patient
yet
a
little
while
be
patient
bruno
i
think
god
intended
you
for
a
backwoods
farmer
and
if
we
only
wait
he
will
no
doubt
open
a
way
for
you
somehow
or
other
precious
poor
fun
mother
replied
bruno
ruefully
yet
in
a
tone
that
his
mother
who
indeed
was
always
dreading
lest
her
longing
for
the
stir
and
bustle
of
city
life
should
lead
him
to
run
away
from
the
farm
he
so
cordially
disliked
leaving
her
to
bear
the
double
burden
of
unshared
troubles
and
anxiety
for
her
welfare
bruno
perry
was
not
a
common
country
boy
rough
rude
and
uncultivated
his
mother
had
enjoyed
a
good
education
in
her
youth
and
possessed
besides
a
refined
gentle
spirit
that
fitted
her
far
better
for
the
cultured
life
of
the
city
than
the
existence
to
which
the
eccentricity
of
her
husband
had
doomed
her
bruno
had
inherited
much
of
her
fine
spirit
together
with
no
small
share
of
his
deep
strong
nature
and
thanks
to
his
faithful
teaching
and
the
wise
use
of
the
few
books
they
had
brought
with
them
into
the
wilderness
was
a
fairly
well
educated
lad
every
saturday
his
father
drove
all
alone
to
the
nearest
settlement
and
brought
back
with
him
a
newspaper
which
bruno
awaited
with
hungry
eyes
and
eagerly
devoured
when
at
last
it
fell
into
his
hands
by
this
means
he
knew
a
little
at
all
events
of
the
great
world
beyond
the
forest
and
this
knowledge
maintained
at
his
desire
to
be
in
the
midst
of
it
only
his
deep
affection
for
his
mother
kept
him
at
home
the
summer
just
past
had
been
an
especially
restless
uneasy
time
for
bruno
his
blood
seemed
fairly
on
fire
with
impatience
at
his
lot
and
even
the
cool
dark
days
of
autumn
brought
no
chill
to
his
ardour
if
anything
they
made
the
matter
worse
for
the
summer
with
its
bright
sunny
mornings
its
delicious
afternoon
baths
in
the
clear
deep
pool
beyond
the
barn
and
its
long
serene
evenings
was
not
so
hard
to
bear
even
in
the
wilderness
neither
was
the
autumn
with
its
nutting
forays
its
partridge
and
woodcock
shooting
and
its
fruit
and
berry
expeditions
by
any
means
intolerable
but
the
long
dreary
monotonous
canadian
winter
when
for
week
after
week
the
mercury
sank
down
below
zero
and
rarely
rose
above
it
when
the
cattle
had
to
be
fed
and
watered
though
the
hands
stiffened
and
the
feet
stung
with
bitter
biting
cold
while
ears
and
cheek
and
nose
were
constantly
being
nipped
by
pitiless
jack
frost
the
long
and
short
of
it
was
that
one
night
after
perry
had
gone
off
grimly
to
bed
looking
much
as
if
he
were
going
to
his
tomb
leaving
his
wife
and
son
sitting
beside
the
big
wood
fire
in
the
kitchen
bruno
drew
his
chair
close
to
and
slipping
his
hand
into
hers
looked
up
into
her
sweet
face
with
a
determined
expression
she
had
never
observed
in
him
before
mother
said
bruno
in
low
earnest
tones
no
use
this
is
the
last
winter
i
shall
ever
spend
in
this
place
i
and
stand
it
any
longer
father
may
say
what
he
likes
but
never
make
a
farmer
of
me
what
will
you
do
bruno
dear
asked
his
mother
gently
seeing
clearly
enough
that
it
was
no
time
for
argument
or
opposition
why
go
right
into
town
and
do
something
i
care
what
it
is
so
long
as
honest
and
it
brings
me
bread
and
butter
rather
be
a
bootblack
in
town
than
stay
out
in
this
hateful
place
but
you
hope
to
be
something
better
than
a
bootblack
you
dearest
questioned
perry
with
a
sad
smile
for
she
felt
that
the
crisis
in
her
life
had
come
and
that
his
whole
future
might
depend
upon
the
way
she
dealt
with
him
now
of
course
i
do
mother
he
answered
smiling
in
his
turn
but
that
will
be
better
than
nothing
for
a
beginning
and
something
better
will
turn
up
after
a
while
very
well
bruno
so
be
it
of
course
no
use
beginning
business
as
a
bootblack
in
when
everybody
is
wearing
overshoes
but
when
the
spring
mud
comes
then
will
be
your
chance
and
perhaps
before
a
better
opening
may
present
itself
bruno
felt
the
force
of
his
clever
reasoning
and
with
a
quiet
laugh
replied
all
right
mother
wait
until
spring
as
patiently
as
i
can
the
afternoon
following
this
conversation
bruno
thought
he
would
go
into
the
forest
and
see
if
he
could
not
get
a
shot
at
something
he
hardly
knew
what
the
snow
lay
deep
upon
the
ground
so
he
strapped
on
his
and
with
gun
on
shoulder
and
hatchet
at
belt
strode
off
into
the
woods
he
was
in
rather
an
unhappy
frame
of
mind
and
hoped
that
a
good
long
walk
and
the
excitement
of
hunting
would
do
him
good
his
clearing
was
not
very
large
and
beyond
its
edge
the
great
forest
stretched
away
unbroken
for
uncounted
leagues
close
at
heels
ran
the
faithful
steeltrap
full
of
joy
at
the
prospect
of
an
outing
the
air
was
very
cold
but
not
a
breath
of
wind
broke
its
stillness
and
the
only
interruptions
of
the
perfect
silence
were
the
crushing
of
the
crisp
snow
beneath
broad
shoes
and
the
occasional
impatient
barks
of
his
canine
companion
climbing
the
hill
that
rose
half
a
mile
to
the
north
from
his
home
bruno
descended
the
other
side
crossed
the
intervening
valley
where
a
brook
ran
gurgling
underneath
its
icy
covering
and
ascended
the
ridge
beyond
pushing
further
and
further
into
the
forest
until
he
had
gone
several
miles
from
the
house
then
he
halted
and
sat
down
upon
a
log
for
a
rest
he
had
not
been
there
many
minutes
before
a
sudden
stir
on
the
part
of
steeltrap
attracted
his
attention
and
looking
up
he
caught
sight
of
a
fine
black
fox
gazing
at
him
curiously
for
an
instant
ere
it
bounded
away
as
quick
as
a
flash
bruno
threw
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
fired
almost
without
taking
aim
and
to
his
vast
delight
the
shot
evidently
took
effect
for
the
fox
after
one
spasmodic
leap
into
the
air
went
limping
off
dragging
a
hind
leg
in
a
way
that
told
clearly
enough
it
was
broken
after
him
steeltrap
after
him
shouted
bruno
the
dog
needed
no
urging
on
with
eager
bark
he
dashed
after
the
wounded
fox
bruno
following
as
fast
as
he
could
away
went
the
three
of
them
at
the
top
of
their
speed
the
boy
just
able
to
keep
his
quarry
in
sight
while
steeltrap
was
doing
his
best
to
get
a
good
grip
of
his
hindquarters
so
as
to
bring
him
to
the
ground
in
this
fashion
they
must
have
gone
a
good
half
mile
when
they
came
to
a
into
which
the
fox
vanished
like
a
shadow
while
steeltrap
afraid
to
follow
contented
himself
with
staying
outside
and
barking
vigorously
on
bruno
coming
up
he
hardly
knew
what
to
do
at
first
telling
steeltrap
to
watch
the
door
he
examined
the
trap
all
round
and
satisfied
himself
that
there
was
no
other
way
for
the
fox
to
get
out
then
he
made
up
his
mind
how
to
act
ha
ha
my
black
beauty
not
going
to
get
off
so
easily
as
that
he
said
and
kneeling
down
he
slipped
off
his
and
stood
in
his
moccasined
feet
then
leaning
his
gun
against
the
wall
of
the
trap
which
i
might
explain
is
built
like
a
tiny
log
hut
having
a
heavy
log
suspended
from
the
roof
in
such
a
way
that
on
a
bear
attempting
to
enter
it
falls
upon
his
back
and
makes
him
a
prisoner
bruno
took
his
hatchet
from
his
belt
and
proceeded
to
crawl
into
the
trap
carefully
avoiding
the
central
stick
which
held
up
the
loose
log
it
was
very
dark
but
he
could
see
the
bright
eyes
of
the
fox
as
it
crouched
in
the
far
corner
holding
his
hatchet
ready
for
a
blow
he
approached
the
fox
and
was
just
about
to
strike
when
with
a
sudden
desperate
dart
it
sprang
past
him
toward
the
door
with
an
exclamation
of
anger
bruno
turned
to
follow
it
and
in
his
hasty
movement
brushed
against
the
illustration
bruno
struck
with
all
his
might
at
his
leg
the
mischief
was
done
in
an
instant
the
heavy
log
fell
and
although
by
a
quick
dodge
to
the
left
bruno
saved
his
shoulder
the
ponderous
thing
descended
upon
his
thigh
and
rolling
down
pinned
his
right
foot
to
the
ground
as
firmly
as
if
he
had
been
the
bear
it
was
intended
to
capture
here
indeed
was
a
perilous
situation
for
poor
bruno
flat
upon
his
back
with
a
huge
log
across
his
ankle
what
was
he
to
do
sitting
up
he
strove
with
all
his
might
to
push
the
log
off
but
he
might
as
well
have
tried
to
move
a
mountain
he
was
fastened
down
beyond
all
hope
of
release
without
outside
help
but
what
hope
was
there
of
outside
help
no
one
knew
where
he
was
for
he
had
not
said
anything
to
his
mother
when
setting
out
and
his
father
had
gone
up
the
road
some
miles
and
would
not
return
until
dark
the
one
chance
was
that
his
father
on
returning
home
would
miss
him
and
perhaps
come
in
search
of
him
following
the
track
made
by
his
but
even
if
he
did
that
could
not
be
for
hours
yet
and
in
the
meantime
he
would
freeze
to
death
for
the
cold
was
intense
the
thermometer
being
many
degrees
below
zero
an
hour
passed
an
hour
of
pain
and
fruitless
conjecture
as
to
the
possibility
of
rescue
as
the
evening
drew
near
bruno
became
desperate
he
gave
up
all
hope
of
his
father
reaching
him
in
time
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
must
either
free
himself
or
die
and
he
saw
but
one
way
of
getting
free
the
log
lay
across
his
leg
just
above
the
ankle
his
hatchet
was
near
him
to
chop
the
log
away
was
utterly
impossible
but
it
would
be
an
easy
thing
to
chop
off
the
foot
that
it
held
so
fast
grasping
the
hatchet
firmly
in
his
right
hand
bruno
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
struck
with
all
his
might
at
his
leg
a
pang
of
awful
agony
shot
through
him
numbed
as
his
nerves
were
with
the
cold
but
setting
his
teeth
in
grim
determination
he
struck
blow
after
blow
heeding
not
the
terrible
suffering
until
at
length
the
bone
snapped
and
bruno
was
free
fainting
with
pain
and
weakness
the
poor
boy
on
hands
and
knees
began
the
long
and
terrible
journey
homeward
his
sufferings
were
beyond
description
but
life
was
very
precious
and
so
long
as
he
retained
consciousness
he
would
not
give
up
the
struggle
fortunately
for
him
he
had
not
gone
more
than
a
hundred
yards
over
the
cold
hard
snow
before
a
bark
from
steeltrap
announced
approach
and
just
as
bruno
fainted
dead
away
an
indian
trapper
who
by
the
merest
chance
had
come
to
see
if
the
trap
had
taken
anything
came
striding
through
the
forest
already
dusky
with
the
shadows
of
night
with
a
grunt
of
surprise
he
approached
bruno
turned
him
over
gently
while
steeltrap
sniffed
doubtfully
at
his
leggings
and
then
recognizing
the
face
and
not
waiting
to
investigate
into
the
causes
of
his
injury
he
bound
his
sash
about
the
bleeding
stump
and
throwing
the
senseless
form
over
his
broad
shoulders
set
out
for
the
perry
house
as
fast
as
he
could
travel
not
sparing
himself
the
utmost
exertion
he
arrived
there
just
as
night
closed
in
and
pushing
into
the
kitchen
deposited
his
burden
upon
the
table
saying
to
perry
who
came
forward
with
frightened
face
your
boy
eh
me
find
him
dead
took
him
up
right
away
eh
when
perry
returned
and
beheld
his
pitiful
and
perilous
condition
for
once
in
his
life
he
seemed
moved
i
must
take
him
in
to
the
hospital
in
the
city
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
said
he
die
if
we
keep
him
here
and
so
it
came
about
that
watched
over
by
his
parents
bruno
was
next
day
carefully
driven
to
the
city
where
by
evening
he
was
snugly
ensconced
in
a
comfortable
cot
in
the
big
bright
ward
of
the
hospital
he
got
well
again
of
course
so
sturdy
a
lad
was
not
going
to
succumb
even
to
such
injuries
as
he
had
suffered
but
his
foot
was
gone
and
there
was
no
replacing
that
and
yet
in
time
he
learned
to
look
upon
that
lost
foot
as
a
blessing
for
through
it
came
the
realization
of
all
his
desires
a
boy
with
only
one
foot
could
not
of
course
be
a
farmer
but
he
could
be
a
clerk
or
something
of
that
sort
accordingly
through
the
influence
of
a
relative
in
the
city
bruno
when
thoroughly
recovered
obtained
a
position
in
a
office
as
copying
clerk
some
years
later
he
was
able
to
enter
upon
the
study
of
the
law
in
due
time
he
began
to
practise
upon
his
own
account
and
with
such
success
that
he
was
ultimately
honoured
with
a
seat
upon
the
bench
as
judge
of
the
supreme
court
peril
at
black
run
there
were
four
of
the
eldest
tall
dark
and
sinewy
bespeaking
his
highland
descent
in
every
line
of
face
and
figure
archie
the
second
short
and
sturdy
fair
of
hair
and
blue
of
eye
the
boy
as
one
could
see
at
a
glance
and
then
the
twins
jim
and
charlie
the
joy
of
the
family
so
much
alike
that
only
their
mother
could
tell
them
apart
without
making
a
of
the
chubbiest
merriest
and
sauciest
youngsters
in
the
whole
of
nova
scotia
squire
stewart
was
very
proud
of
his
boys
and
looking
at
them
now
as
they
all
came
up
from
the
shore
together
evidently
discussing
something
very
earnestly
his
countenance
glowed
with
pride
and
affection
when
they
drew
near
he
hailed
them
with
a
cheery
hallo
boys
what
are
you
talking
about
there
face
was
somewhat
clouded
as
he
answered
in
quiet
respectful
tones
hugh
and
i
were
talking
about
going
over
to
black
run
for
a
fishing
and
jim
and
charlie
want
us
to
take
them
too
what
do
you
think
about
it
hugh
asked
the
squire
turning
to
his
eldest
son
well
just
this
way
sir
answered
hugh
the
little
chaps
will
only
be
a
bother
to
us
and
perhaps
get
themselves
into
trouble
we
watch
them
and
watch
our
lines
at
the
same
time
certain
no
we
pleaded
jim
while
charlie
seconded
him
with
eager
eyes
be
good
oh
let
them
come
interposed
archie
look
after
them
hugh
still
seemed
inclined
to
hold
back
but
the
squire
settled
the
matter
by
saying
take
them
with
you
this
time
hugh
and
if
they
prove
to
be
a
bother
they
need
not
go
again
until
they
are
old
enough
to
take
care
of
themselves
all
right
sir
take
mind
you
youngsters
to
the
you
must
behave
just
as
if
you
were
at
church
black
run
was
the
chief
outlet
of
the
lake
on
which
maplebank
the
stewart
house
was
situated
here
its
superabundance
poured
out
through
a
long
deep
channel
leading
to
a
tumultuous
rapid
that
foamed
fiercely
over
dangerous
rocks
before
settling
down
into
good
behaviour
again
the
largest
and
finest
fish
were
sure
to
be
found
in
or
about
black
run
but
then
it
was
full
six
miles
away
from
maplebank
and
an
expedition
there
required
a
whole
day
to
be
done
properly
so
that
the
stewart
boys
did
not
get
there
very
often
the
saturday
to
which
all
four
boys
were
looking
eagerly
forward
proved
as
fine
as
heart
could
wish
and
after
an
early
breakfast
they
started
off
hugh
and
archie
took
the
oars
the
twins
curled
up
on
the
where
their
elder
brother
could
keep
his
eye
upon
them
and
away
they
went
at
a
long
steady
stroke
that
in
two
hours
brought
them
to
their
destination
be
the
best
place
to
anchor
hugh
asked
archie
as
he
drew
in
his
oars
and
prepared
to
throw
over
the
big
stone
that
was
to
serve
them
as
a
mooring
out
there
i
guess
answered
hugh
pointing
to
a
spot
about
fifty
yards
above
the
head
of
the
run
oh
too
far
away
we
catch
any
fish
there
objected
archie
who
was
not
at
all
of
a
cautious
temperament
anchor
just
off
that
point
hugh
shook
his
head
too
close
afraid
archie
the
awfully
strong
you
know
and
be
sure
to
drift
not
a
bit
of
it
persisted
archie
our
hold
us
all
right
but
hugh
was
not
to
be
persuaded
and
so
they
took
up
their
position
where
he
had
indicated
they
fished
away
busily
for
some
time
the
two
elder
boys
using
rods
and
the
twins
simply
until
a
goodly
number
of
fine
fish
flapping
about
the
bottom
of
the
boat
gave
proof
of
their
success
still
archie
was
not
content
his
heart
was
set
upon
fishing
right
at
the
mouth
of
the
run
for
he
had
a
notion
that
some
extra
big
fellows
were
to
be
caught
there
and
he
continued
harping
upon
the
subject
until
at
last
hugh
gave
way
all
right
archie
do
as
you
please
here
take
the
oars
and
you
stand
on
the
bow
and
let
the
anchor
go
when
at
the
spot
delighted
at
thus
gaining
his
point
archie
did
as
he
was
bidden
and
with
a
few
strong
strokes
hugh
directed
the
boat
toward
the
run
so
soon
as
they
approached
she
began
to
feel
the
influence
of
the
current
and
hugh
let
her
drift
with
it
archie
was
so
engrossed
in
picking
out
the
very
best
place
that
he
did
not
notice
how
the
boat
was
gathering
speed
until
hugh
shouted
drop
the
anchor
archie
what
are
you
thinking
about
archie
was
standing
in
the
bow
balancing
the
big
stone
on
the
gunwale
and
the
instant
hugh
called
he
tumbled
it
over
the
strong
line
to
which
it
was
attached
ran
swiftly
out
as
the
boat
slipped
down
the
run
then
it
stopped
with
a
sharp
sudden
jerk
for
the
end
was
reached
and
the
stone
had
caught
fast
between
the
big
stones
on
the
bottom
when
the
jerk
came
archie
suspecting
nothing
was
standing
upright
on
the
bow
thwart
and
at
once
like
a
stone
from
a
catapult
he
went
flying
through
the
air
striking
the
water
with
a
loud
splash
and
disappearing
into
its
dark
embrace
illustration
like
a
stone
from
a
catapult
archie
struck
the
water
with
a
loud
splash
first
impulse
was
to
burst
out
laughing
for
he
knew
archie
could
swim
like
a
seal
and
when
a
moment
later
his
head
appeared
above
the
water
he
hailed
him
gaily
well
done
arch
that
was
splendid
come
back
and
try
it
again
you
while
the
twins
laughed
and
crowed
over
their
amusing
performance
archie
was
not
disposed
to
take
a
serious
view
of
the
matter
either
and
shouted
back
try
it
yourself
come
along
wait
for
you
when
however
he
sought
to
regain
the
boat
he
found
the
current
too
strong
for
him
and
despite
his
utmost
exertions
could
make
little
or
no
headway
against
it
this
would
not
have
been
a
cause
for
much
alarm
however
had
not
the
banks
of
the
run
been
lined
with
a
dense
growth
of
huge
rushes
through
which
samson
himself
could
hardly
have
effected
a
passage
while
at
their
edge
the
water
ran
deep
and
swift
moreover
it
still
had
plenty
of
the
winter
chill
in
it
for
the
time
was
beginning
to
feel
a
good
deal
frightened
archie
called
out
have
to
come
and
help
me
hugh
i
get
back
to
you
now
unquestionably
the
proper
thing
for
hugh
to
have
done
was
to
take
up
the
anchor
and
letting
the
boat
drift
down
to
where
archie
was
haul
him
on
board
but
strange
to
say
cool
cautious
hugh
for
once
lost
his
head
his
pale
frightened
face
startled
him
and
without
pausing
to
think
he
threw
off
his
coat
and
boots
and
leaped
into
the
water
where
a
few
strenuous
strokes
brought
him
to
his
side
the
twins
in
guileless
innocence
of
any
danger
thought
all
this
great
sport
here
were
their
two
elder
brothers
having
a
swim
without
first
taking
off
their
clothes
they
had
never
seen
anything
quite
so
funny
before
they
kneeled
upon
the
and
leaned
over
the
gunwale
and
clapped
their
hands
in
childish
ecstasy
over
what
seemed
to
them
so
intensely
diverting
but
to
the
two
elder
brothers
it
was
very
far
from
being
diverting
when
hugh
reached
archie
he
found
him
already
half
exhausted
and
when
grasping
him
with
his
left
hand
he
strove
to
force
him
upward
against
the
current
he
realized
that
ere
long
he
would
be
in
the
same
condition
himself
the
strength
of
the
current
was
appalling
the
best
that
he
could
do
thus
encumbered
by
archie
was
to
keep
from
slipping
downward
to
make
any
headway
was
utterly
impossible
hoping
that
there
might
be
perhaps
a
helpful
eddy
on
the
other
side
of
the
run
he
made
his
way
across
only
to
find
the
current
no
less
powerful
there
the
situation
grew
more
and
more
serious
the
dense
rushes
defied
all
efforts
to
pierce
them
and
the
boys
were
fain
to
grasp
a
handful
of
the
tough
stems
and
thereby
keep
themselves
from
being
swept
away
by
the
relentless
current
into
the
grasp
of
the
fatal
rapids
whose
roar
they
could
distinctly
hear
but
a
little
distance
below
hugh
says
that
the
memory
of
those
harrowing
moments
will
never
lose
its
vividness
blissfully
unconscious
of
their
peril
the
twins
laughed
and
chattered
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
their
chubby
faces
beaming
upon
the
two
boys
struggling
desperately
for
life
in
the
rushing
water
even
in
the
midst
of
that
struggle
hugh
was
thrilled
with
anxiety
as
he
looked
back
at
them
lest
they
should
lose
their
balance
and
topple
over
into
the
water
and
he
shouted
earnestly
to
them
take
care
jim
take
care
charlie
whereat
they
both
nodded
their
curly
heads
and
laughed
again
hugh
was
now
exhausted
and
sorely
divided
in
his
mind
as
to
whether
he
should
stay
by
his
brother
and
perhaps
go
down
to
death
with
him
or
leaving
him
in
his
desperate
plight
struggle
back
to
the
boat
if
that
were
possible
to
prevent
a
like
catastrophe
to
the
twins
poor
fellow
it
was
a
terrible
dilemma
for
a
mere
lad
happily
however
he
was
spared
the
necessity
of
choosing
either
alternative
suddenly
and
swiftly
a
boat
shot
out
from
the
northern
side
of
the
mouth
and
in
it
sat
a
brawny
farmer
whose
quick
ear
caught
at
once
faint
though
frantic
shout
for
help
hold
on
there
my
lads
get
you
in
a
minute
he
shouted
back
sending
his
boat
alongside
that
of
the
he
quickly
fastened
his
painter
to
it
and
then
dropped
down
the
current
until
he
reached
the
endangered
boys
just
in
time
my
hearties
said
he
cheerily
now
then
let
me
give
you
a
hand
on
board
and
grasping
them
one
after
the
other
in
his
mighty
arms
he
lifted
them
over
the
side
into
his
own
boat
neither
hugh
nor
archie
was
any
the
worse
for
their
wetting
and
the
twins
thought
them
even
more
in
their
wet
bedraggled
condition
than
they
were
in
the
water
but
neither
of
them
is
nevertheless
at
all
likely
to
forget
live
as
long
as
they
may
the
time
they
were
in
such
peril
at
black
run
and
go
all
the
oldest
inhabitants
of
halifax
were
of
one
mind
as
to
its
being
the
very
coldest
winter
in
their
recollection
it
really
seemed
as
if
some
rash
fellow
had
challenged
jack
frost
to
do
his
best
or
worst
in
the
matter
of
cold
and
jack
had
accepted
the
challenge
with
the
result
of
making
the
poor
haligonians
wish
with
all
their
hearts
that
they
were
inhabitants
of
central
africa
instead
of
the
atlantic
coast
of
british
america
one
reason
why
they
felt
the
cold
so
keenly
was
that
owing
to
the
situation
of
their
city
right
on
the
edge
of
the
ocean
with
the
great
gulf
stream
not
so
very
far
off
their
winters
were
usually
more
or
less
mild
and
broken
but
this
particular
winter
was
neither
mild
nor
broken
on
the
contrary
it
was
both
steady
and
severe
one
frosty
day
followed
another
each
one
dragging
the
thermometer
down
a
few
degrees
lower
until
at
last
a
wonderful
thing
wonderful
indeed
that
the
already
mentioned
oldest
inhabitants
again
were
unanimous
in
assuring
inquirers
that
it
had
happened
only
once
before
in
their
this
was
that
the
broad
beautiful
harbour
after
hiding
its
bosom
for
several
days
beneath
a
cloud
of
mist
called
by
seafaring
folk
the
barber
surrendered
one
night
to
the
embrace
of
the
ice
king
and
froze
over
solidly
from
shore
to
shore
such
a
splendid
sight
as
it
made
wearing
this
sparkling
breastplate
not
a
flake
of
snow
fell
upon
it
from
away
down
below
island
up
through
the
narrows
and
into
the
basin
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
lay
a
vast
expanse
of
glistening
ice
upon
which
the
boys
soon
ventured
with
their
skates
and
sleds
followed
quickly
by
the
men
and
a
day
or
two
later
horses
and
sleighs
were
driving
merrily
to
and
fro
between
halifax
and
dartmouth
as
though
they
had
been
accustomed
to
it
all
their
life
the
whole
town
went
wild
over
this
wonderful
event
quite
the
whole
town
after
all
for
there
were
some
unfortunate
individuals
who
had
ships
at
their
wharves
that
they
wanted
to
send
to
sea
or
expected
ships
from
the
sea
to
come
in
to
their
wharves
and
they
quite
failed
to
see
any
fun
in
sleighing
or
skating
where
there
ought
to
have
been
dancing
waves
if
however
some
of
the
business
men
thought
a
frozen
harbour
an
unmitigated
nuisance
none
of
the
boys
who
attended
famous
school
were
of
the
same
mind
to
them
it
was
an
unmixed
blessing
and
they
were
so
carried
away
by
its
taking
place
that
they
actually
had
the
hardihood
to
present
a
petition
to
the
stern
doctor
begging
for
a
holiday
in
its
honour
and
what
is
still
more
extraordinary
they
carried
their
point
to
the
extent
of
one
whole
day
with
which
unwonted
boon
they
were
fain
to
be
content
it
was
on
this
little
anticipated
holiday
that
the
event
took
place
which
it
is
the
business
of
this
story
to
relate
two
of
the
most
delighted
boys
at
school
were
harvey
silver
and
andy
martin
they
were
great
chums
being
as
much
attached
to
each
other
as
they
were
unlike
one
another
in
appearance
they
lived
in
the
same
neighbourhood
were
pretty
much
of
the
same
fourteen
last
to
the
same
school
learned
the
same
lessons
and
were
fond
of
the
same
sports
but
there
the
resemblance
between
them
stopped
andy
was
hasty
impetuous
and
daring
harvey
was
quiet
slow
and
cautious
in
fact
one
was
both
the
contrast
and
the
complement
of
the
other
and
it
was
this
no
doubt
more
than
anything
else
which
made
them
so
attached
to
each
other
had
their
mutual
likeness
been
greater
their
mutual
liking
would
perhaps
have
been
less
it
just
splendid
having
a
whole
holiday
cried
harvey
enthusiastically
to
his
chum
as
the
crowd
of
boys
poured
tumultuously
out
of
school
for
their
morning
recess
longstrap
having
with
a
grim
smile
just
announced
that
in
view
of
the
freezing
of
the
harbour
being
such
an
extremely
rare
event
he
had
decided
to
grant
them
one
liberty
we
must
put
in
the
whole
day
on
the
harbour
responded
andy
heartily
we
take
some
lunch
with
us
and
then
we
go
home
in
the
middle
of
the
day
what
a
big
head
you
have
to
be
sure
exclaimed
harvey
with
a
look
of
mock
admiration
a
great
idea
do
it
the
following
day
was
thursday
and
when
the
two
boys
opened
their
eyes
after
such
a
sleep
as
only
tired
healthy
schoolboys
can
secure
they
were
delighted
to
find
every
promise
of
a
fine
day
the
sun
shone
brightly
the
air
was
clear
the
wind
was
hushed
and
everything
in
their
favour
as
harvey
in
the
highest
spirits
took
his
seat
at
the
breakfast
table
he
pointed
out
the
window
from
which
a
full
view
of
the
harbour
could
be
obtained
look
father
said
he
if
there
the
english
mail
steamer
just
coming
round
the
lighthouse
be
no
getting
to
the
wharf
for
her
what
do
you
think
do
come
up
the
harbour
as
far
as
they
can
and
then
land
the
mails
and
passengers
on
the
ice
i
suppose
answered
silver
but
how
can
she
come
up
when
all
frozen
queried
harvey
easily
enough
ram
her
way
through
until
it
is
thick
enough
to
stop
her
oh
what
fun
that
will
be
exclaimed
harvey
how
glad
i
am
that
we
have
a
holiday
so
we
can
see
it
all
well
take
good
care
of
yourself
my
boy
and
be
sure
and
be
back
before
dark
said
silver
when
according
to
promise
andy
martin
called
for
him
soon
after
breakfast
harvey
dragged
him
to
the
window
and
pointing
out
the
steamer
now
coming
into
the
harbour
at
a
good
rate
of
speed
said
gleefully
the
english
mail
steamer
andy
and
father
says
ram
her
way
up
through
the
ice
as
far
as
she
possibly
can
that
be
grand
shortly
after
the
two
boys
left
the
house
and
hastened
off
down
water
street
until
they
reached
a
wharf
from
which
they
could
easily
get
out
upon
the
ice
they
were
both
good
skaters
for
their
age
strong
sure
and
speedy
and
their
first
proceeding
was
to
dart
away
across
the
harbour
spurting
against
one
another
in
the
first
freshness
of
their
youthful
vigour
until
they
had
reached
the
outer
edge
of
the
dartmouth
wharves
they
then
thought
it
was
about
time
to
rest
a
bit
and
regain
their
breath
what
perfect
ice
gasped
andy
ever
so
much
better
than
ice
it
harvey
being
very
much
out
of
breath
simply
nodded
andy
was
right
too
whatever
be
the
reason
the
finest
ice
a
skater
can
have
is
that
which
forms
upon
salt
water
it
has
good
qualities
in
which
ice
is
altogether
lacking
hallo
andy
the
steamer
cried
harvey
suddenly
having
quite
recovered
his
wind
sure
enough
just
beyond
island
the
great
dark
hull
of
the
ocean
greyhound
was
discernible
as
with
superb
majesty
she
solemnly
pushed
her
way
through
the
thin
ragged
ice
which
marked
where
the
current
had
been
too
strong
for
the
breastplate
to
form
properly
full
of
impatience
to
watch
the
doings
the
two
boys
hurried
toward
her
at
their
best
pace
so
that
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
not
far
from
her
bows
and
as
far
out
upon
the
ice
as
they
thought
it
safe
to
venture
no
doubt
it
was
a
rare
and
thrilling
sight
and
not
only
the
boys
but
all
who
were
upon
the
harbour
at
the
time
gathered
to
witness
it
the
steamer
was
now
in
the
thick
ice
and
could
no
longer
force
her
way
onward
steadily
so
she
had
to
resort
to
ramming
her
course
lay
parallel
to
the
wharves
and
about
one
hundred
yards
or
more
from
them
reversing
her
engines
she
would
back
slowly
down
the
long
narrow
canal
made
in
her
onward
progress
until
some
hundreds
of
yards
away
then
coming
to
a
halt
for
a
moment
she
would
begin
to
go
ahead
at
first
very
slowly
almost
imperceptibly
then
gradually
gathering
speed
as
the
huge
screw
spun
round
sending
waves
from
side
to
side
of
the
lane
faster
and
still
faster
while
the
spectators
thrilling
with
excitement
held
their
breath
in
expectation
faster
and
still
faster
until
at
last
with
a
crash
that
made
even
the
vast
frame
tremble
from
stem
to
stern
the
sharp
steel
bow
struck
the
icy
barrier
and
with
splintering
sound
bored
its
way
fiercely
through
but
losing
a
little
impetus
with
every
yard
gained
so
that
by
the
time
the
steamer
had
made
her
own
length
her
onset
was
at
an
end
and
sullenly
withdrawing
she
had
to
renew
the
attack
as
at
the
beginning
so
at
the
end
of
the
charge
there
was
a
moment
when
she
stood
perfectly
still
this
was
when
all
her
impetus
was
exhausted
and
for
a
brief
second
she
paused
before
rebounding
and
backing
away
during
this
almost
imperceptible
instant
it
was
just
possible
for
a
swift
skater
to
dart
up
and
touch
the
bow
as
it
towered
above
the
ice
hard
pressed
against
it
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
such
a
feat
except
its
daring
perhaps
for
that
very
were
those
present
rash
enough
to
attempt
it
big
ben
hill
the
champion
speed
skater
was
the
first
and
he
succeeded
so
admirably
that
others
soon
followed
his
example
harvey
and
andy
were
intensely
interested
spectators
as
one
after
another
darting
up
just
at
the
right
moment
touched
with
outstretched
the
bow
and
then
with
skilful
turn
swung
safely
out
of
the
way
illustration
the
ice
opened
beneath
his
very
feet
going
to
try
it
too
said
andy
under
his
breath
do
nothing
of
the
kind
andy
answered
harvey
just
touch
and
go
every
time
yes
i
will
buntie
boggs
just
did
it
and
if
he
can
do
it
i
can
returned
andy
eagerly
as
he
spoke
the
steamer
came
gliding
on
for
another
charge
with
eyes
flashing
nerves
tingling
muscles
tense
and
heart
beating
like
a
andy
awaited
her
onset
crash
crack
splinter
then
like
an
arrow
he
flew
at
her
bow
harvey
tried
to
hold
him
back
but
in
vain
over
the
smooth
ice
he
shot
and
right
up
to
the
big
black
bow
with
a
smile
of
triumph
he
stretched
out
his
hand
the
ice
opened
suddenly
beneath
his
very
feet
and
he
pitched
headlong
into
the
dark
swirling
water
a
cry
of
horror
went
up
from
the
crowd
and
with
one
impulse
they
moved
as
closely
as
they
dared
to
the
edge
of
the
open
water
there
was
a
moment
of
agonized
silence
then
a
shout
of
joy
as
a
fur
cap
followed
by
a
dark
body
emerged
from
the
water
and
presently
frightened
face
was
turned
imploringly
toward
them
he
could
swim
well
enough
and
keep
himself
afloat
all
right
but
the
steamer
retreating
along
the
narrow
canal
created
a
strong
current
which
bore
him
after
her
and
he
was
in
no
slight
danger
save
him
oh
save
him
you
cried
harvey
grasping
ben
arm
imploringly
i
will
that
my
lad
never
fear
but
how
was
it
to
be
done
all
along
the
edge
of
the
canal
in
which
andy
was
struggling
for
life
and
for
some
yards
from
it
the
ice
was
cracked
and
broken
into
jagged
fragments
making
it
impossible
for
any
one
to
approach
near
enough
to
the
boy
to
help
him
out
and
for
the
same
reason
he
was
unable
to
climb
out
by
himself
a
rope
a
rope
i
must
have
a
rope
shouted
ben
hill
looking
eagerly
around
him
his
quick
eye
fell
upon
a
schooner
lying
at
the
head
of
a
wharf
near
by
cheer
him
up
boys
cried
ben
be
back
in
a
second
and
like
a
flash
he
sped
off
toward
the
schooner
almost
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
he
reached
her
side
sprang
over
the
low
bulwarks
on
to
the
deck
snatched
up
a
coil
of
rope
that
lay
upon
the
cabin
poop
leaped
back
to
the
ice
and
with
mighty
strides
came
down
toward
the
water
amid
the
cheers
of
the
onlookers
look
out
for
yourself
andy
ben
shouted
as
he
drew
close
to
the
edge
coiling
the
rope
for
a
throw
now
then
catch
and
the
long
rope
went
swirling
through
the
air
a
cry
of
disappointment
from
the
crowd
announced
that
it
had
fallen
short
all
right
luck
next
time
called
ben
as
he
rapidly
recovered
the
rope
for
another
fling
venturing
a
little
nearer
and
taking
more
pains
he
flung
it
out
with
all
his
strength
and
this
time
a
shout
of
joy
proclaimed
that
his
aim
had
been
true
put
it
under
your
arms
called
out
ben
letting
go
the
cake
of
ice
to
which
he
had
been
clinging
andy
slipped
the
rope
under
his
arms
now
then
hold
tight
and
slowly
carefully
hand
over
hand
big
ben
with
feet
braced
firmly
and
muscles
straining
drew
andy
through
the
broken
cakes
and
up
upon
the
firm
safe
ice
the
moment
he
was
out
of
danger
a
shout
burst
forth
from
the
relieved
spectators
and
they
crowded
eagerly
round
rescued
and
rescuer
out
of
the
way
there
please
out
of
the
way
cried
ben
as
he
gathered
dripping
form
up
in
his
arms
this
lad
must
be
beside
a
fire
as
soon
as
possible
fortunately
the
crew
were
still
on
board
the
schooner
from
which
the
precious
rope
had
been
borrowed
and
they
had
a
fine
fire
in
the
cabin
into
this
warm
nook
andy
was
borne
without
delay
his
wet
clothes
were
soon
stripped
off
and
he
was
turned
into
a
bunk
until
dry
ones
could
be
procured
a
messenger
was
despatched
with
the
news
to
his
home
and
before
long
his
mother
with
feelings
strangely
divided
between
smiles
and
tears
drove
down
for
the
boy
who
had
come
so
near
to
being
lost
to
her
for
ever
that
evening
as
harvey
and
andy
were
sitting
by
the
fireside
recounting
for
the
tenth
time
the
stirring
incidents
of
the
day
and
voicing
together
the
praises
of
big
ben
hill
andy
with
a
sly
twinkle
of
the
eye
turned
to
harvey
saying
do
you
remember
saying
to
me
that
it
was
a
touch
and
go
every
time
yes
andy
what
of
it
well
i
was
just
thinking
that
in
my
case
i
touch
but
i
the
water
and
i
be
in
a
hurry
to
try
it
again
cave
in
the
cliff
say
bruce
you
think
we
could
manage
to
put
in
a
whole
week
up
among
the
hills
this
autumn
asked
fred
harris
of
bruce
borden
as
the
two
friends
strolled
along
together
one
september
afternoon
through
the
main
street
of
shelburne
one
of
the
prettiest
towns
upon
the
nova
scotian
i
guess
so
fred
responded
bruce
promptly
father
promised
me
a
holiday
to
spend
any
way
i
chose
if
i
stuck
to
the
shop
all
summer
and
been
thinking
for
some
time
what
i
would
do
a
grand
idea
of
yours
when
would
we
go
about
the
first
of
next
month
would
be
the
best
time
it
we
could
shoot
partridges
then
you
know
and
there
be
any
mosquitoes
or
black
flies
to
bother
us
all
right
fred
count
me
in
just
dying
for
a
shot
at
the
partridges
and
besides
i
know
of
a
lake
up
in
the
hills
where
there
are
more
trout
than
we
could
catch
in
a
year
and
splendid
big
fellows
too
archie
mack
was
telling
me
about
it
the
other
day
why
the
very
place
i
wanted
to
go
to
and
it
was
archie
who
told
me
about
it
too
said
fred
tell
you
what
bruce
we
must
get
archie
to
come
with
us
and
then
have
a
fine
time
for
sure
hooray
got
the
notion
now
cried
bruce
with
delight
a
splendid
fellow
for
the
woods
and
such
a
good
shot
he
hardly
ever
misses
why
i
mind
meeting
a
bear
if
archie
was
present
ah
you
though
mr
bruce
laughed
fred
i
guess
if
either
you
or
i
were
to
come
across
a
bear
see
more
of
our
heels
than
our
face
i
know
i
stop
to
make
his
acquaintance
warrant
archie
run
from
any
bear
said
bruce
and
not
so
sure
that
i
would
either
however
small
chance
of
our
seeing
one
so
not
much
good
talking
about
it
but
i
must
run
back
to
the
shop
now
you
come
in
after
tea
and
make
our
plans
fred
promised
he
would
and
went
on
down
the
street
while
bruce
returned
to
his
place
behind
the
counter
and
if
he
was
a
little
in
attending
to
the
customers
so
that
he
gave
white
pepper
instead
of
salt
and
tea
instead
of
coffee
we
must
not
be
too
hard
upon
him
bruce
borden
was
the
son
of
one
of
the
most
thriving
shopkeepers
in
shelburne
and
his
father
after
letting
him
go
to
school
and
the
academy
until
he
was
sixteen
years
of
age
had
then
put
an
apron
on
him
and
installed
him
behind
the
counter
there
to
learn
the
management
of
the
business
which
he
promised
him
would
be
robert
borden
and
son
in
due
time
if
bruce
took
hold
of
it
in
the
right
way
and
bruce
did
take
hold
he
was
a
bright
active
energetic
lad
with
a
pleasant
manner
and
made
an
excellent
clerk
pleasing
his
father
so
well
that
as
the
first
apprenticeship
was
drawing
to
a
close
borden
quite
of
his
own
accord
made
glad
heart
by
saying
that
he
might
soon
have
a
whole
holiday
to
do
what
he
liked
with
before
settling
down
to
the
work
friend
fred
harris
as
the
son
of
a
wealthy
who
held
mortgages
on
half
the
farms
in
the
neighbourhood
did
not
need
to
go
behind
a
counter
but
on
the
contrary
went
to
college
about
the
same
time
that
bruce
put
on
his
apron
he
was
now
at
home
for
the
vacation
which
would
not
end
until
the
last
of
october
he
was
a
lazy
luxurious
kind
of
a
chap
although
not
lacking
either
in
mind
or
muscle
as
he
had
shown
more
than
once
when
the
occasion
demanded
it
bruce
and
he
had
been
playmates
from
the
days
of
short
frocks
and
were
very
strongly
attached
to
one
another
they
rarely
disagreed
and
when
they
did
made
it
up
again
as
soon
as
possible
in
accordance
with
his
promise
fred
harris
came
to
shop
that
same
evening
just
before
they
were
closing
up
bringing
archie
mack
with
him
and
after
the
shutters
had
been
put
on
and
everything
arranged
for
the
night
the
three
boys
sat
down
to
perfect
their
plans
for
the
proposed
hunting
excursion
to
the
hills
archie
mack
bore
quite
a
different
appearance
from
his
companions
he
was
older
to
begin
with
and
much
taller
his
long
sinewy
frame
betokening
a
more
than
usual
amount
of
strength
and
activity
he
had
only
of
late
come
to
shelburne
the
early
part
of
his
life
having
been
spent
on
one
of
the
pioneer
farms
among
the
hills
where
he
had
become
almost
as
good
a
woodsman
as
an
indian
seeming
to
be
able
to
find
his
way
without
difficulty
through
what
looked
like
trackless
wilderness
and
to
know
everything
about
the
birds
in
the
air
the
beasts
on
the
ground
or
the
fish
in
the
waters
this
knowledge
of
course
made
him
a
good
deal
of
a
hero
among
the
town
boys
and
they
regarded
acquaintance
with
him
as
quite
a
privilege
particularly
as
being
of
a
reserved
retiring
nature
like
all
true
backwoodsmen
it
was
not
easy
to
get
on
intimate
terms
with
him
he
was
now
employed
at
big
and
was
in
high
favour
with
his
master
because
of
the
energy
and
fidelity
with
which
he
attended
to
his
work
now
then
fred
to
business
said
bruce
as
they
took
possession
of
the
chairs
in
the
back
office
when
shall
we
start
and
what
shall
we
take
the
man
to
answer
these
questions
answered
fred
i
move
that
we
appoint
him
of
the
expedition
with
full
power
to
settle
everything
better
make
sure
that
i
can
go
first
said
archie
it
do
to
be
counting
your
chickens
before
hatched
oh
no
fear
of
that
replied
fred
father
promised
me
give
you
a
holiday
so
that
we
could
go
hunting
together
some
time
this
autumn
and
he
never
fails
to
keep
his
promises
all
right
then
fred
if
you
say
so
only
too
willing
to
go
with
you
you
may
be
sure
so
let
us
proceed
to
business
said
archie
and
for
the
next
hour
or
more
the
three
tongues
wagged
very
busily
as
all
sorts
of
plans
were
proposed
discussed
accepted
or
rejected
archie
of
course
taking
the
lead
in
the
consultation
and
usually
having
the
final
say
at
length
everything
was
settled
so
far
as
it
could
be
then
and
very
well
satisfied
with
the
result
of
their
deliberations
the
boys
parted
for
the
night
as
soon
as
he
got
home
fred
harris
told
his
father
all
about
it
and
readily
obtained
his
consent
to
giving
archie
a
leave
there
was
therefore
nothing
more
to
be
done
than
to
get
their
guns
and
other
things
ready
and
await
the
coming
of
the
of
october
with
all
the
patience
at
their
command
october
is
a
glorious
month
in
nova
scotia
the
sun
shines
down
day
after
day
from
an
almost
cloudless
sky
the
air
is
clear
cool
and
bracing
without
being
keen
the
ground
is
dry
and
firm
the
forests
are
decked
in
a
wonderful
garb
of
gold
and
flame
interwoven
with
green
whose
richness
and
beauty
defy
description
and
beneath
which
a
wealth
of
wild
fruit
and
berries
cherries
plums
indian
pears
blackberries
huckleberries
blueberries
and
tempts
you
at
every
step
by
its
luscious
largess
but
for
the
sportsman
there
are
still
greater
attractions
in
the
partridges
which
fly
in
flocks
among
the
trees
and
the
trout
and
salmon
which
hash
through
the
streams
ready
victims
for
rod
or
gun
early
in
the
morning
of
the
last
day
in
september
the
three
boys
set
out
for
the
hills
it
would
be
a
whole
drive
for
their
waggon
was
pretty
heavily
loaded
with
tent
stove
provisions
bedding
ammunition
and
other
things
and
moreover
the
road
went
all
the
way
so
steep
indeed
were
some
of
the
ascents
that
they
found
it
necessary
to
relieve
the
waggon
of
their
weight
or
the
horse
could
hardly
have
reached
the
top
but
all
this
was
fun
to
them
they
rode
or
walked
as
the
case
required
talked
till
their
tongues
were
tired
about
what
they
hoped
to
do
laughed
at
prince
and
oscar
their
two
a
fine
english
setter
the
other
a
nondescript
kind
of
they
scoured
the
woods
on
either
side
of
the
road
with
great
airs
of
importance
scared
the
squirrels
that
stopped
for
a
peep
at
the
travellers
by
snapping
caps
at
them
and
altogether
enjoyed
themselves
greatly
just
as
the
evening
shadows
were
beginning
to
fall
they
reached
the
farm
on
which
archie
father
lived
where
they
were
to
spend
the
night
and
to
leave
their
waggon
until
their
return
from
camp
mack
gave
them
a
hearty
welcome
and
a
bountiful
backwoods
supper
of
fried
chicken
and
so
forth
for
which
they
had
most
appreciative
appetites
and
soon
after
thoroughly
tired
out
they
tumbled
into
bed
to
sleep
like
tops
until
the
morning
time
to
get
up
out
of
bed
with
you
rang
through
the
house
the
next
morning
as
archie
mack
who
was
the
first
to
waken
proceeded
to
waken
everybody
else
oh
dear
how
sleepy
i
am
groaned
fred
harris
rubbing
his
eyes
and
feeling
as
though
he
had
been
asleep
only
a
few
minutes
up
everybody
no
time
to
waste
shouted
archie
again
and
with
great
reluctance
the
other
two
boys
dragging
themselves
out
on
the
floor
got
into
their
clothes
as
quickly
as
they
could
breakfast
wras
hurriedly
despatched
and
soon
after
with
all
their
belongings
packed
on
an
old
cart
drawn
by
a
patient
ox
and
driven
by
mack
himself
the
little
party
made
their
way
through
the
woods
to
their
which
was
to
be
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
archie
had
been
telling
them
about
without
much
difficulty
they
found
a
capital
spot
for
their
tent
mack
helped
them
to
put
it
up
and
get
everything
in
order
and
then
bade
them
promising
to
return
in
six
days
to
take
them
all
back
again
the
first
four
days
passed
away
without
anything
of
special
note
happening
they
had
glorious
weather
fine
fishing
and
very
successful
shooting
they
waded
in
the
water
tramped
through
the
woods
ate
like
eskimos
and
slept
like
stones
getting
browner
and
fatter
every
day
as
nothing
occurred
to
mar
the
pleasure
of
their
camp
out
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
day
they
all
went
off
in
different
directions
fred
taking
prince
the
setter
with
him
bruce
the
hound
oscar
and
archie
going
alone
when
they
got
back
to
camp
that
evening
bruce
had
a
wonderful
story
to
tell
here
it
is
in
his
own
words
tell
you
what
it
is
fellows
a
big
contract
on
hand
for
you
know
that
run
which
comes
into
the
lake
at
the
upper
end
well
i
thought
follow
it
up
and
see
where
it
leads
to
so
on
i
went
for
at
least
a
couple
of
miles
till
i
came
to
a
big
cliff
i
felt
a
little
tired
and
sat
down
on
a
boulder
to
rest
a
bit
oscar
kept
running
around
with
his
nose
at
the
ground
as
if
he
suspected
something
all
of
a
sudden
he
stopped
short
sniffed
very
hard
and
then
with
a
loud
long
howl
rushed
off
to
the
cliff
and
began
to
climb
a
kind
of
ledge
that
gave
him
a
foothold
i
followed
him
as
best
i
could
but
it
easy
work
i
can
tell
you
up
he
went
and
up
i
scrambled
after
him
till
at
last
he
stopped
where
there
was
a
sort
of
shelf
and
at
the
end
of
it
a
big
hole
in
the
rock
that
looked
very
much
like
a
cave
he
ran
right
up
to
the
hole
and
began
to
bark
with
all
his
might
i
went
up
pretty
close
too
wondering
what
on
earth
oscar
was
so
excited
about
when
the
first
thing
i
knew
one
head
and
then
another
poked
out
of
the
hole
and
snarled
fiercely
at
oscar
i
tell
you
boys
it
just
made
me
creep
and
i
wait
for
another
look
but
tumbled
down
that
ledge
again
as
fast
as
i
could
and
made
for
camp
on
the
dead
run
it
was
not
my
day
for
bears
a
wise
chap
bruce
said
archie
clapping
him
on
the
back
you
have
done
much
damage
with
that
even
if
you
had
stayed
to
introduce
yourself
awfully
glad
found
the
cave
father
told
me
about
these
bears
and
said
give
a
sovereign
for
their
tails
an
old
and
two
cubs
i
guess
it
was
the
cubs
you
saw
the
old
woman
must
have
been
out
visiting
if
known
that
they
were
only
cubs
i
might
have
tried
a
dose
of
small
shot
on
them
said
bruce
regretfully
just
as
well
you
answered
archie
pay
our
respects
to
them
take
my
rifle
and
you
two
load
up
with
ball
in
both
barrels
and
then
be
ready
for
business
so
it
was
all
arranged
in
that
way
and
then
almost
too
excited
to
sleep
the
three
lads
settled
down
for
the
night
which
could
not
be
too
short
to
please
them
they
were
up
bright
and
early
the
next
morning
bolted
a
hasty
breakfast
and
then
proceeded
to
clean
and
load
their
guns
with
the
utmost
care
fred
and
bruce
each
had
fine
guns
in
one
barrel
of
which
they
put
a
bullet
and
in
the
other
a
heavy
load
of
buckshot
archie
had
his
rifle
and
a
very
good
one
it
was
which
he
well
knew
how
to
use
besides
this
each
carried
a
in
his
belt
thus
armed
and
accoutred
they
set
forth
full
of
courage
and
in
high
spirits
they
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
and
following
course
the
day
before
for
oscar
who
seemed
to
thoroughly
understand
what
they
were
about
led
them
straight
to
the
foot
of
the
cliff
and
would
have
rushed
right
up
to
the
cave
again
if
archie
had
not
caught
him
and
tied
him
to
a
boulder
then
they
sat
down
to
study
the
situation
for
them
to
go
straight
up
the
ledge
with
the
chance
of
the
old
bear
charging
down
upon
them
any
moment
would
be
foolhardy
in
the
extreme
they
must
find
out
some
better
way
than
that
of
besieging
the
stronghold
hurrah
exclaimed
archie
after
studying
the
face
of
the
cliff
earnestly
i
have
it
do
you
see
that
ledge
over
there
to
the
left
if
we
go
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
cliff
we
can
get
on
that
ledge
most
likely
and
take
us
to
right
over
the
shelf
where
the
cave
is
try
it
anyway
holding
oscar
tight
they
crept
cautiously
around
the
foot
of
the
cliff
and
up
at
the
left
until
they
reached
the
point
archie
meant
there
sure
enough
they
found
the
ledge
two
sharp
eyes
had
discovered
and
it
evidently
led
over
toward
the
cave
just
as
he
hoped
once
more
tying
the
dog
who
looked
up
at
them
in
surprised
protest
but
was
too
well
trained
to
make
any
noise
the
boys
made
their
way
slowly
along
the
narrow
ledge
until
at
last
they
came
to
a
kind
of
niche
from
which
they
could
look
straight
down
upon
the
shelf
now
only
about
fifteen
feet
below
them
splendid
boys
whispered
archie
gripping
arm
as
safe
as
a
here
and
they
poke
their
noses
out
of
the
cave
without
our
seeing
them
keeping
very
still
and
quiet
the
boys
waited
patiently
for
what
would
happen
then
getting
tired
of
the
inaction
bruce
picked
up
a
fragment
of
rock
and
threw
it
down
upon
the
ledge
below
where
it
rattled
noisily
immediately
a
deep
fierce
growl
came
from
the
cave
and
a
moment
afterwards
the
old
bear
herself
rolled
out
into
the
sunshine
the
top
of
the
morning
to
you
missus
called
out
archie
saucily
and
how
may
your
ladyship
be
feeling
this
morning
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
bear
turned
quickly
and
catching
sight
of
the
three
boys
in
such
close
proximity
to
the
privacy
of
her
home
uttered
a
terrible
roar
of
rage
and
rearing
up
on
her
hind
legs
strove
to
climb
the
piece
of
cliff
that
separated
them
from
her
bruce
and
fred
who
had
never
seen
a
wild
bear
before
shrank
into
the
corner
but
archie
looking
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
stood
his
ground
rifle
in
hand
no
no
my
lady
not
this
morning
said
he
with
an
ironical
bow
quite
near
enough
already
foiled
in
her
first
attempt
the
great
creature
gathered
herself
together
for
another
spring
and
once
more
came
toward
them
with
a
savage
roar
as
she
did
so
her
broad
black
breast
was
fully
exposed
without
a
tremor
of
fear
or
excitement
archie
lifted
his
rifle
to
his
shoulder
and
aimed
straight
at
the
heart
a
sharp
report
rang
out
through
the
clear
morning
air
followed
close
by
a
hideous
howl
of
mingled
rage
and
pain
and
when
the
smoke
cleared
away
the
boys
with
throbbing
hearts
looked
down
upon
a
huge
black
shape
that
writhed
and
struggled
in
the
agonies
of
death
a
simultaneous
shout
of
victory
burst
from
their
lips
and
gave
relief
to
their
excited
emotions
illustration
archie
aimed
straight
at
the
heart
hurrah
archie
done
for
her
cried
fred
clapping
him
vigorously
on
the
back
yes
i
reckon
she
have
any
more
mutton
at
expense
said
archie
with
a
triumphant
smile
just
look
at
her
now
she
a
monster
in
truth
she
was
a
monster
and
even
though
the
life
seemed
to
have
completely
left
her
the
boys
thought
it
well
to
wait
a
good
many
minutes
before
going
any
nearer
after
some
time
when
there
could
be
no
longer
any
doubt
they
scrambled
down
the
way
they
came
and
unloosing
oscar
approached
the
cave
from
the
front
oscar
bounded
on
ahead
with
eager
leaps
and
catching
sight
of
the
big
black
body
rushed
furiously
at
it
but
the
moment
he
reached
it
he
stopped
smelled
the
body
suspiciously
and
then
gave
vent
to
a
strange
long
howl
that
sounded
curiously
like
a
death
lament
after
that
there
could
be
nothing
more
to
fear
so
the
three
boys
climbed
up
on
the
shelf
and
proceeded
to
examine
their
quarry
she
was
very
large
and
in
splendid
condition
having
been
feasting
upon
unlimited
berries
for
weeks
past
now
for
the
cubs
said
archie
the
only
half
done
if
we
leave
these
young
rascals
alone
sorry
too
big
to
take
alive
ha
ha
oscar
says
at
home
sure
enough
the
hound
was
barking
furiously
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
which
he
appeared
none
too
anxious
to
enter
bruce
suppose
you
try
what
damage
your
buckshot
would
do
in
there
suggested
archie
all
right
assented
bruce
and
going
up
to
the
mouth
he
peered
in
two
pairs
of
gleaming
eyes
that
were
much
nearer
than
he
expected
made
him
start
back
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
but
quickly
recovering
himself
he
raised
his
gun
and
fired
right
at
the
little
round
balls
of
light
following
upon
the
report
came
a
series
of
queer
cries
and
presently
all
was
still
i
guess
that
did
the
business
said
bruce
why
you
go
in
and
see
asked
archie
thank
you
rather
not
but
you
can
it
you
like
replied
bruce
very
well
i
will
said
archie
promptly
laying
down
his
gun
and
drawing
his
he
crawled
cautiously
into
the
cave
not
a
move
or
sound
was
there
inside
a
little
distance
from
the
mouth
he
touched
one
soft
furry
body
from
which
life
had
fled
and
just
behind
it
another
the
buckshot
had
done
its
work
the
cubs
were
as
dead
as
their
mother
the
next
thing
was
to
get
them
out
the
cave
was
very
low
and
narrow
and
the
cubs
pretty
big
fellows
archie
crawled
out
again
for
a
consultation
with
the
others
various
plans
were
suggested
but
rejected
until
at
length
archie
called
out
i
have
it
crawl
in
there
and
get
a
good
grip
of
one
of
the
cubs
and
then
you
fellows
will
catch
hold
of
my
legs
and
haul
us
both
out
together
and
so
that
was
the
way
they
managed
it
pulling
and
puffing
and
toiling
away
until
finally
after
tremendous
exertion
they
had
the
two
cubs
lying
beside
their
mother
on
the
ledge
phew
quite
enough
work
for
me
said
fred
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
for
me
too
chorused
the
others
i
move
we
go
back
to
camp
and
wait
there
until
father
comes
with
his
cart
and
then
come
up
here
for
the
bears
said
archie
carried
unanimously
cried
the
others
and
with
that
they
all
betook
themselves
back
to
camp
the
rest
of
the
story
is
soon
told
mack
came
along
that
afternoon
praised
the
boys
highly
for
their
pluck
and
with
experienced
hands
skinned
and
cut
up
the
bears
to
archie
as
of
right
fell
the
skin
of
the
old
bear
while
the
others
got
a
apiece
with
which
they
went
triumphantly
home
to
be
the
heroes
of
the
town
for
the
next
nine
days
at
least
illustration
the
perfection
of
motion
if
skating
be
the
poetry
of
who
shall
say
no
is
certainly
the
perfection
of
motion
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
to
surpass
it
in
the
world
for
coasting
however
good
is
not
to
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
with
this
glorious
sport
no
previous
acquaintance
with
fast
along
behind
a
fast
trotter
or
over
the
shining
rails
at
the
tail
of
a
lightning
prepare
you
for
the
first
shoot
down
a
regular
toboggan
slide
the
effect
upon
a
beginner
is
brightly
illustrated
by
the
replies
of
a
fair
american
who
made
her
first
venture
at
the
montreal
carnival
arriving
safely
at
the
bottom
after
a
particularly
swift
descent
she
was
asked
how
she
liked
it
perfectly
splendid
she
gasped
as
soon
as
she
recovered
her
breath
i
have
missed
it
for
the
world
then
of
course
take
another
oh
no
indeed
not
for
the
entire
universe
but
she
did
all
the
same
and
soon
became
as
enthusiastic
over
the
fun
as
any
of
her
canadian
cousins
all
ages
and
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
people
toboggan
in
canada
indeed
if
you
were
to
ask
what
is
the
national
winter
sport
of
the
new
dominion
the
answer
would
infallibly
be
tobogganing
in
no
other
country
was
it
ever
known
until
within
the
past
few
years
when
such
accounts
of
its
delights
have
gone
forth
that
it
bids
fair
to
come
into
common
use
wherever
there
is
snow
enough
to
permit
it
while
it
can
be
enjoyed
to
perfection
only
at
the
slides
specially
prepared
for
the
purpose
any
smooth
sharp
slope
with
a
bit
of
level
plain
at
its
foot
well
covered
with
snow
having
a
good
hard
crust
affords
the
means
for
fine
sport
the
advantage
of
the
artificial
slide
is
that
it
can
be
kept
constantly
in
order
and
therefore
may
be
in
condition
for
sliding
when
the
snow
is
altogether
too
soft
and
deep
upon
the
hills
these
slides
are
to
be
seen
in
every
part
of
canada
their
gaunt
framework
rising
up
tall
and
stiff
out
of
some
level
field
or
better
still
upon
a
thus
securing
a
double
elevation
they
are
roughly
yet
strongly
constructed
of
beams
and
boards
and
comprise
one
or
sometimes
two
long
troughs
placed
side
by
side
with
a
flight
of
stairs
adjoining
these
troughs
are
curved
in
the
shape
of
a
cycloid
and
are
from
three
to
five
feet
wide
the
length
of
course
varying
with
the
height
of
the
structure
when
winter
has
finally
set
in
they
are
paved
with
big
blocks
of
ice
from
bottom
to
top
over
which
loose
snow
is
scattered
and
then
abundance
of
water
poured
on
until
jack
frost
kindly
assisting
the
whole
is
welded
together
into
one
solid
substantial
mass
a
slide
once
properly
prepared
and
kept
in
order
by
the
addition
of
a
little
more
snow
and
water
now
and
then
will
last
all
winter
and
the
more
it
is
used
the
faster
and
truer
it
becomes
in
the
grounds
of
rideau
hall
the
official
residence
of
the
of
canada
there
are
two
immense
slides
and
tobogganing
may
there
be
enjoyed
in
full
perfection
let
us
suppose
we
have
been
invited
to
one
of
those
brilliant
torchlight
fêtes
which
form
so
popular
an
item
in
the
programme
of
the
winter
hospitality
a
more
beautiful
scene
than
that
which
lies
all
around
and
underneath
us
when
we
have
accomplished
the
toilsome
ascent
of
the
steep
slippery
stairs
of
the
toboggan
slide
can
hardly
be
imagined
stretching
away
from
the
narrow
platform
upon
which
we
stand
two
long
double
lines
of
flaring
torches
mark
out
the
slides
slanting
sharply
downward
until
they
reach
the
level
far
below
and
then
run
off
to
hide
their
endings
somewhere
in
the
dusky
recesses
of
the
forest
at
our
left
another
line
of
torches
interspersed
with
chinese
lanterns
encircles
a
gleaming
mirror
upon
whose
surface
the
skaters
glide
smoothly
this
way
and
that
while
from
its
oddly
out
of
season
it
must
be
maypole
flaunts
its
rainbow
ribbons
a
little
further
on
the
long
low
curling
rink
gaily
decorated
proclaims
good
cheer
from
every
lighted
window
turning
to
our
left
we
catch
through
the
trees
a
glimpse
of
the
other
skating
pond
with
its
ice
palace
for
the
band
and
quaint
log
hut
for
tired
skaters
right
in
front
of
us
a
huge
bonfire
blazes
up
making
music
with
its
merry
crackling
but
we
have
lingered
too
long
in
taking
all
this
in
we
are
stopping
the
way
and
an
impatient
crowd
is
pressing
hard
upon
us
let
us
place
our
toboggan
then
carefully
in
the
centre
of
the
groove
adjust
the
cushions
coil
up
the
cord
and
seat
ourselves
securely
with
stout
grasp
upon
the
all
ready
cries
the
steerer
ay
ay
we
reply
giving
the
toboggan
a
strong
shove
he
springs
on
behind
with
foot
outstretched
for
rudder
and
the
next
the
only
way
to
describe
what
follows
is
that
we
just
drop
into
space
we
simply
coast
for
so
steep
so
smooth
is
the
descent
that
we
are
not
conscious
of
having
any
connection
whatever
with
the
solid
earth
for
at
least
yards
and
then
with
a
bump
and
rattle
and
scrape
of
hard
wood
against
still
harder
ice
we
speed
like
an
arrow
through
lines
of
flashing
light
and
rows
of
onlookers
until
full
four
hundred
yards
away
we
come
gently
to
a
stop
in
the
soft
deep
snow
amid
the
trees
the
ordinary
toboggan
is
made
in
the
following
fashion
three
strips
of
birch
or
bass
wood
a
quarter
of
an
inch
thick
and
from
four
to
eight
feet
long
by
eight
or
nine
inches
broad
are
put
side
by
side
and
held
in
position
by
placed
about
two
feet
apart
the
whole
being
bound
tightly
together
by
lashings
of
gut
for
which
grooves
are
cut
in
the
bottom
so
that
they
may
not
be
chafed
by
the
snow
the
thin
end
of
the
strips
is
then
turned
up
and
over
like
the
dashboard
of
a
sleigh
and
secured
by
strong
pieces
of
gut
tied
under
the
first
a
long
thin
pole
on
either
side
made
fast
by
loops
to
the
for
a
a
comfortable
cushion
stuffed
with
straw
shavings
or
wool
and
a
long
cord
are
then
added
and
behold
your
toboggan
is
complete
as
may
be
guessed
from
the
use
of
gut
for
fastenings
the
toboggan
is
an
indian
invention
and
was
in
use
among
the
red
men
as
a
means
of
winter
conveyance
for
centuries
before
the
white
man
saw
in
it
a
source
of
delightful
amusement
it
is
doubtful
if
the
indian
way
of
making
toboggans
can
be
much
improved
upon
although
within
the
past
few
years
ingenuity
has
been
exerted
toward
that
end
the
peculiarity
of
the
new
toboggans
consists
in
narrow
slats
being
used
instead
of
the
broad
thin
boards
and
screws
in
place
of
gut
lashings
for
my
own
part
i
prefer
the
kind
the
affairs
are
no
faster
are
a
good
bit
heavier
more
liable
to
break
and
being
much
stiffer
have
not
that
springy
motion
which
forms
so
attractive
a
feature
of
the
others
a
third
kind
just
now
making
its
appearance
has
the
held
some
inches
high
by
means
of
metal
sockets
and
the
front
is
gathered
into
a
peak
while
it
too
is
put
together
with
screws
the
higher
is
unquestionably
an
advantage
and
if
it
prove
durable
will
probably
render
this
last
style
very
popular
in
choosing
a
toboggan
you
must
be
careful
to
select
one
whose
wood
is
and
as
free
from
knots
as
possible
precisely
as
a
cricketer
would
choose
his
bat
the
should
be
closely
examined
for
they
have
to
endure
severe
strains
and
will
be
sure
to
snap
if
there
is
a
weak
spot
in
them
then
the
gut
lashings
ought
to
have
close
inspection
especial
care
being
taken
to
see
that
they
are
well
sunk
into
the
wood
along
the
bottom
so
as
to
be
safe
from
chafing
where
the
gut
has
given
way
i
have
substituted
strong
brass
wire
with
very
good
results
after
once
it
was
drawn
tight
enough
but
this
i
found
no
easy
matter
having
selected
a
toboggan
to
your
satisfaction
the
next
thing
is
to
cushion
it
the
cushion
should
run
the
whole
length
and
be
not
less
than
two
inches
thick
good
stout
furniture
rep
stuffed
with
excelsior
makes
a
capital
cushion
although
some
prefer
heavy
rug
material
and
extravagant
folk
even
go
the
length
of
fur
trappings
the
cushion
must
be
well
secured
to
the
or
it
will
give
trouble
by
slipping
off
at
the
first
bump
as
to
the
management
of
a
toboggan
it
is
not
easy
to
say
much
more
than
that
it
requires
a
quick
eye
a
good
nerve
and
strength
enough
to
steer
there
are
several
ways
of
steering
one
is
to
sit
with
feet
turned
up
in
front
and
guide
the
machine
by
means
of
sticks
held
in
the
hands
another
is
to
kneel
and
employ
the
hands
in
the
same
way
then
some
very
daring
and
reckless
fellows
will
venture
to
stand
up
and
using
the
cord
as
reins
go
careering
down
the
slope
with
the
danger
of
a
tremendous
tumble
every
moment
the
most
sensible
and
effective
way
of
all
however
is
to
sit
sideways
having
one
leg
curled
up
underneath
you
and
the
other
stretched
out
behind
like
the
steering
oar
of
a
yankee
fashion
as
it
is
called
in
canada
this
mode
not
only
gives
you
perfect
control
of
your
toboggan
but
has
the
further
and
very
important
advantage
of
making
it
easy
for
you
to
roll
off
and
acting
as
a
drag
bring
the
whole
affair
to
a
speedy
stop
in
the
event
of
danger
appearing
ahead
more
than
once
have
i
escaped
what
might
possibly
have
been
serious
injury
at
the
cost
of
a
little
rough
scraping
over
the
snow
from
two
to
six
people
can
sit
comfortably
on
a
toboggan
according
to
its
length
the
perfect
number
is
man
at
the
front
to
bear
the
brunt
of
danger
and
ward
off
the
blinding
spray
of
snow
two
ladies
next
and
then
the
steerer
bringing
up
the
rear
and
responsible
for
the
safety
of
all
ah
me
but
what
a
grand
thing
it
is
to
be
young
enough
to
thoroughly
enjoy
the
tobogganing
season
the
toboggan
has
many
advantages
over
the
sled
such
as
is
used
for
coasting
wherever
a
sled
can
go
a
toboggan
can
go
also
while
on
many
a
hill
that
offers
splendid
tobogganing
a
sled
would
be
quite
useless
again
it
is
much
lighter
than
the
sled
which
means
that
you
do
not
have
to
work
half
so
hard
for
your
fun
a
third
advantage
is
its
safety
more
especially
in
the
hands
of
children
it
has
no
sharp
ends
to
make
ugly
gashes
in
little
legs
tobogganing
has
its
perils
of
course
and
i
might
if
i
chose
tell
some
experiences
that
would
perhaps
cause
a
nervous
thrill
but
what
sport
is
absolutely
free
from
danger
and
since
mark
twain
has
earned
the
gratitude
of
us
all
by
proving
that
more
people
die
in
their
beds
than
anywhere
else
why
should
the
most
timid
be
deterred
by
the
faint
possibility
of
peril
from
enjoying
one
of
the
finest
and
most
healthful
winter
amusements
in
the
world

cinderella
the
dear
old
stories
that
delighted
us
in
our
nurseries
as
mother

sister
lured
the
lingering
dustman
to
our
eyes
by
telling
them
over
and
over
do
not
by
any
means
belong
to
us
alone
they
are
the
common
property
of
mankind
even
the
most
rude
and
ignorant
peoples
have
them
in
some
form
or
other
and
the
study
of
these
myths
and
the
associated
with
them
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
branches
of
modern
philology
jack
the

aladdin

his
wonderful
lamp
and
all
the
rest
of
them
have
their
parallels
in
the
farthest
corners
of
the
globe
they
are
to
be
found
too
among
the
dusky
race
whose
mothers
told
them
to
their
children
long
before
eyes
looked
covetously
upon
american
shores

powder
sent
terror
into

it
was
told
to
an
unforgetful
listener
beside
a
in
nova

comparing
with
our
own
familiar
fable
of
cinderella
see
if
the
two
are
not
alike
in
so
many
points
as
to
make
it
easy
to
believe
they
had
a
common
origin
in
the
heart
of
one
of
those
vast
forests
that
used
to
cover
the
acadian
land
with
billowy
seas
of
verdure
as
boundless
seemingly
as
the
ocean
itself
lay
a
large
long
lake
at
one
end
of
which
an
indian
village
of
more
than
usual
size
had
grown
up
it
was
a
capital
place
for
a
settlement
because
the
lake
abounded
with
fish
the
surrounding
forest
with
game
and
near
at
hand
were
sunny
glades
and
bits
of
open
upon
which
sufficient
corn
beans
and
pumpkins
could
be
raised
for
the
needs
of
the
inhabitants

highly
did
these
village
folk
value
their
good
fortune
that
they
would
allow
no
other
indians
to
share
it
and
any
attempt
to
settle
near
that
lake
meant
the
massacre
or
flight
of
the
rash
intruders
a
little
way
from
the
village
the
lake
shore
rose
up
into
a
kind
of
eminence
having
a
clump
of
trees
upon
its
crown
and
in
the
midst
of
this
clump
stood
a
wigwam
that
had
more
interest
for
the
maidens
of
the
place
than
any
other
they
would
often
watch
the
curling
up
through
the
trees
and
wish
that
in
some
mysterious
way
they
could
get
into
the
interior
of
that
wigwam
without
the
occupants
having
any
warning
and
many
times
they
would
quite
by
chance
you
know
wander
off
in
that
direction
or
along
the
beach
below
where
the
canoe
would
be
drawn
up
when
he
was
at
home
looking
out
very
eagerly
and
very
hopefully
from
their
brown
eyes
but
always
returning
from
their
quest
disappointed
now
what
was
the
reason
of
their
curious
conduct
well
tell
you
in
a
few
words
in
this
wigwam
which
was
larger
and
finer
than
any
in
the
village
lived
a
young
chief
named
the
moose
who
was
not
only
very
handsome
and
very
rich
but
aggravatingly
attractive
quality
of
the
power
of
making
himself
invisible
at
will
so
that
he
could
be
seen
only
by
those
to
whom
he
was
pleased
to
reveal
himself
taking
these
three
things
into
account
and
adding
a
wit
that
was
generally
understood
to
be
meditating
it
any
wonder
that
the
dusky
lasses
with
eyes
and
ebon
locks
took
a
particularly
lively
interest
in
the
wigwam
on
the
point
as
was
very
natural
under
the
circumstances
the
possessions
merits
and
designs
of
formed
the
most
important
item
of
village
gossip
especially
as
he
had
made
it
known
that
he
would
select
his
wife
after
so
curious
not
to
say
ungallant
a
fashion
for
instead
of
his
going
awooing
among
the
girls
he
proposed
that
the
girls
should
come
awooing
to
him
adorned
in
their
bravest
attire
and
looking
their
very
prettiest
the
maidens
were
to
present
themselves
before
him
and
the
first
one
that
could
see
him
plainly
enough
to
describe
what
he
had
on
he
would
marry
the
way
they
went
about
it
was
as
follows
washed
their
faces
anointed
their
heads
bedecked
themselves
with
their
brightest
ornaments
and
then
directed
their
steps
to
the
wigwam
of
arranging
it
so
as
to
arrive
there
a
little
before
the
hour
of
the
young
return
from
his
daily
hunting
foray
sister
who
kept
house
for
him
and
of
whom
he
was
very
fond
would
receive
them
graciously
and
together
they
would
go
down
to
the
shore
to
await
the
coming
presently
a
fine
canoe
would
be
seen
gliding
swiftly
over
the
calm
surface
eagerly
the
maidens
peer
through
the
gathering
shadows
but
the
canoe
seems
impelled
by
magic
for
no
human
hand
is
visible
as
it
nears
the
shore
the
sister
asks
nemeeyok
richigunum
do
you
see
my
brother
every
eye
is
strained
in
the
direction
of
the
canoe
and
some
coming
to
the
aid
of
perhaps
pretend
she
could
see
its
mysterious
occupant
of
what
is
his
made
is
then
asked
this
was
a
poser
but
a
lucky
guess
might
possibly
hit
the
mark
so
the
aspirant
for
the
hand
would
make
answer
that
it
was
a
piece
of
raw
hide
or
withe
or
something
else
that
had
been
known
to
be
applied
to
such
a
use
oh
no
the
sister
would
reply
softly
but
crushing
out
all
hope
let
us
go
home
you
have
not
seen
my
brother
and
so
they
would
go
back
to
the
wigwam
where
a
little
later
they
would
be
tantalized
by
seeing
the
sister
taking
a
load
of
game
apparently
from
the
air
and
a
pair
of
moccasins
from
feet
that
obstinately
refused
to
be
visible
thus
they
were
convinced
that
there
was
no
was
really
present
although
they
could
not
see
him
one
after
another
the
village
maidens
had
tried
their
luck
as
they
called
it
but
all
had
failed
alike
to
catch
even
a
glimpse
of
the
provoking
master
of
the
wigwam
on
the
point
matters
had
gone
on
in
this
unsatisfactory
fashion
for
some
time
and
the
fastidious
bid
fair
to
be
an
old
bachelor
when
he
was
saved
from
so
sad
a
fate
in
the
way
i
shall
now
proceed
to
relate
near
the
centre
of
the
village
stood
a
large
wigwam
in
which
dwelt
a
widower
who
had
three
daughters
the
eldest
of
whom
was
a
tall
girl
the
second
a
rather
plain
girl
and
the
youngest
a
short
slight
delicate
little
creature
with
a
pretty
pleading
face
who
was
despised
by
her
big
sister
and
very
cruelly
treated
by
her
because
she
seemed
so
weak
and
useless
in
fact
poor
led
a
wretched
life
of
it
for
her
sister
who
was
of
course
mistress
of
the
tent
would
lay
far
heavier
tasks
upon
her
than
she
could
possibly
perform
and
then
if
they
were
not
done
would
beat
her
most
unmercifully
and
sometimes
even
burn
her
with
brands
from
the
fire
when
her
father
who
to
tell
the
truth
was
but
an
indifferent
sort
of
a
parent
would
find
her
covered
with
burns
and
bruises
and
ask
the
meaning
of
it
the
elder
sister
would
reply
that
she
had
fallen
into
the
fire
or
tripped
over
a
tree
root
or
something
of
that
kind
and
neither
nor
the
second
sister
dared
contradict
her
they
were
both
so
much
afraid
of
her
strong
hands
so
this
shameful
state
of
affairs
continued
until
the
poor
condition
was
most
pitiable
for
her
hair
was
singed
off
close
to
her
head
her
face
and
body
scarred
with
burns
and
bruises
and
her
back
bent
with
toil
it
was
not
strong
enough
to
bear
illustration
are
discovered
at
last
he
says
of
course
the
two
elder
sisters
had
been
among
the
candidates
for
hand
and
proud
as
they
were
of
their
good
looks
and
of
their
finery
both
had
failed
utterly
to
see
the
mysterious
chief
their
despised
little
sister
knew
of
their
going
only
too
well
for
her
persecutor
gave
her
a
wicked
beating
when
she
came
home
disappointed
by
way
of
working
off
her
one
day
when
was
sitting
alone
in
the
wigwam
weeping
over
her
hard
fate
the
thought
suddenly
flashed
into
her
should
not
try
her
fortune
at
it
seemed
absurd
of
course
but
it
could
hardly
make
things
any
worse
and
even
though
would
not
think
her
worth
marrying
he
might
in
some
way
not
very
clear
to
the
poor
troubled
mind
shield
her
from
her
cruelty
had
no
fine
clothes
to
put
on
a
few
beads
given
her
by
a
compassionate
squaw
were
her
only
ornaments
but
this
did
not
deter
her
gathering
a
quantity
of
she
fashioned
for
herself
an
odd
misshapen
gown
that
was
enough
to
give
even
an
indian
a
turn
an
old
pair
of
her
moccasins
were
soaked
to
soften
them
and
drawn
over
her
bruised
feet
and
then
with
a
queer
to
hide
her
singed
poll
and
her
scanty
beads
arranged
to
the
best
advantage
she
set
off
quietly
one
afternoon
toward
the
camp
on
the
point
her
big
sister
seeing
the
direction
she
was
taking
screamed
after
her
to
come
back
but
she
only
hastened
her
steps
forward
the
people
of
the
village
stared
rudely
at
her
as
she
passed
and
divining
her
purpose
hooted
derisively
after
her
but
she
kept
steadily
on
and
paid
no
heed
to
them
her
whole
heart
was
in
her
enterprise
and
she
felt
as
though
she
would
die
rather
than
turn
back
at
length
she
reaches
lodge
sister
comes
to
the
door
and
receives
her
pleasantly
at
the
proper
time
she
conducts
her
to
the
where
they
await
the
return
the
sister
soothing
her
throbbing
pulse
by
gentle
inquiries
as
to
her
life
and
kindly
sympathy
for
her
woes
just
at
dusk
a
canoe
comes
toward
them
shooting
swiftly
over
the
water
and
the
sister
says
my
canoe
can
you
see
him
yes
murmurs
her
heart
beating
high
with
hope
of
what
then
is
his
made
muncwan
is
the
quick
reply
it
is
a
piece
of
rainbow
very
good
responds
the
sister
with
a
brilliant
smile
you
have
indeed
seen
my
brother
let
us
go
home
and
prepare
for
him
so
they
hasten
back
to
the
wigwam
heart
palpitating
betwixt
delight
at
her
success
and
anxiety
lest
when
he
found
what
an
insignificant
little
creature
she
really
was
might
refuse
to
keep
his
promise
to
marry
the
girl
who
should
first
be
able
to
see
him
as
soon
as
they
reach
the
tent
the
sister
proceeds
to
prepare
her
visitor
for
the
nuptial
ceremony
and
the
young
girl
gives
herself
unhesitatingly
into
her
hands
the
uncouth
dress
is
stripped
off
and
flung
into
the
fire
and
a
handsome
robe
richly
adorned
with
beads
takes
its
place
pure
spring
water
is
brought
and
as
the
kind
sister
dashes
it
over
the
face
and
rubs
the
scarred
features
softly
with
her
hands
lo
every
scar
and
spot
and
blemish
vanishes
and
the
face
comes
out
fair
and
beautiful
as
it
never
was
before
realizing
the
wondrous
change
the
young
girl
utters
an
exclamation
of
delight
then
checks
herself
and
puts
her
hand
to
her
head
ah
she
says
sadly
i
have
no
hair
will
despise
me
when
he
sees
i
have
no
hair
never
fear
little
one
the
sister
answers
reassuringly
and
passing
her
hands
over
the
singed
and
frizzled
hair
behold
another
marvel
for
it
springs
out
in
richer
profusion
than
ever
before
and
falls
in
long
thick
tresses
down
the
back
of
now
too
happy
to
speak
catching
it
up
the
sister
coils
it
deftly
round
the
young
head
and
then
just
as
the
toilet
is
complete
and
radiant
with
joy
hope
and
beauty
stands
in
the
centre
of
the
lodge
comes
bounding
in
with
his
load
of
game
at
sight
of
the
charming
girl
before
him
he
stops
short
and
looks
inquiringly
at
his
sister
then
the
situation
dawns
upon
him
we
are
discovered
at
last
he
says
with
a
bright
smile
taking
the
young
hand
yes
brother
your
wife
has
come
at
last
replies
the
sister
and
is
she
not
a
beauty
so
and
were
married
and
like
the
heroes
and
heroines
of
all
true
fairy
tales
lived
happily
ever
after
illustration
on
the
banks
of
newfoundland
fisher
folk
scattered
up
and
down
the
rocky
shore
of
nova
scotia
sometimes
standing
out
bravely
upon
a
promontory
that
projects
into
the
very
midst
of
the
breakers
sometimes
nestling
away
cosily
in
the
curve
of
a
quiet
bay
the
white
cottages
of
the
hardy
fisher
folk
give
touches
of
warmth
and
life
to
a
scene
that
would
otherwise
be
one
of
unredeemed
desolation
they
are
not
very
imposing
edifices
and
viewed
from
the
respectful
distance
which
the
dangers
of
that
inhospitable
coast
compel
the
passing
ship
to
keep
they
seem
still
smaller
than
is
really
the
case
but
they
are
all
homes
and
in
their
two
or
three
cramped
rooms
boys
and
girls
have
been
born
and
bred
the
young
people
made
love
and
mated
and
the
old
people
closed
their
eyes
in
the
last
long
sleep
as
generation
has
succeeded
generation
so
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
lads
who
thence
go
forth
into
distant
parts
of
the
world
as
many
of
them
do
find
their
hearts
turning
longingly
back
to
the
little
cottage
by
the
sea
and
that
they
often
return
to
spend
their
last
years
in
the
old
place
voyaging
along
the
coast
some
lovely
summer
afternoon
and
from
your
comfortable
chair
on
the
deck
watching
these
pretty
cottages
with
their
black
roofs
and
white
sides
coming
into
view
as
point
after
point
is
opened
out
and
noting
how
trim
and
secure
they
seem
and
the
glorious
prospect
they
command
from
the
windows
which
look
out
from
either
side
the
central
door
like
sleepless
eyes
it
is
easy
to
imagine
that
the
sons
must
have
a
fine
free
healthy
life
of
it
and
be
far
better
off
than
the
boys
in
the
dusty
noisy
cities
well
no
doubt
they
are
better
off
in
some
respects
they
have
plenty
of
fresh
air
and
sunshine
and
room
to
grow
in
while
nothing
could
be
more
wholesome
than
their
food
of
fish
and
potatoes
but
their
life
is
a
hard
one
nevertheless
and
i
doubt
if
many
lads
would
be
eager
to
exchange
with
them
could
they
first
have
a
experience
of
it
if
the
mackerel
herring
cod
and
haddock
upon
which
the
fisher
folk
depend
for
their
living
were
more
regular
in
their
habits
ami
turned
up
at
the
same
place
at
the
same
time
every
year
so
that
the
men
with
the
nets
and
hooks
could
count
upon
their
harvests
as
the
men
with
the
scythes
and
hoes
can
upon
theirs
the
lot
would
be
a
fairly
comfortable
one
but
there
is
nothing
in
this
world
more
uncertain
than
fish
not
the
slightest
reliance
can
be
placed
upon
them
they
are
here
and
off
somewhere
else
one
season
school
after
school
of
mackerel
will
pour
into
the
little
bay
where
norman
hays
and
john
mackesey
and
george
brown
have
their
fishing
berths
as
the
area
assigned
to
each
man
is
called
and
fill
the
seines
of
these
lucky
fellows
to
repletion
again
and
again
as
fast
as
they
can
spread
them
then
perhaps
one
two
three
seasons
will
pass
without
enough
fish
putting
in
an
appearance
to
make
one
good
haul
the
mackerel
catching
is
the
most
interesting
as
it
is
the
most
profitable
phase
of
the
toil
and
for
both
reasons
the
boys
like
it
the
best
although
from
its
being
at
the
same
time
the
most
uncertain
in
its
results
they
know
very
well
it
can
not
be
depended
upon
for
a
living
the
season
for
these
beautiful
and
delicious
fish
begins
about
the
end
of
june
and
so
soon
as
it
is
time
for
them
to
appear
the
highest
points
along
the
coast
are
taken
possession
of
by
men
and
boys
who
stay
there
all
day
long
watching
intently
the
surface
of
the
sea
below
them
for
the
first
sign
of
the
silver
scales
which
when
caught
can
be
turned
into
silver
coins
it
is
often
long
and
weary
work
this
watching
day
succeeds
day
without
bringing
anything
but
through
scorching
sun
or
soaking
rain
fine
weather
or
foggy
weather
the
patiently
persevere
at
last
some
bright
morning
when
the
sea
seems
still
asleep
jack
keen
young
eyes
descry
a
curious
ripple
on
the
water
far
beneath
his
eyrie
his
heart
gives
a
throb
and
his
pulses
beat
like
but
he
is
afraid
at
first
to
shout
for
fear
it
is
only
a
morning
zephyr
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
fairly
quivering
with
excitement
he
gazes
intently
for
one
moment
more
and
then
shouting
a
school
a
school
at
the
top
of
his
strong
young
voice
he
goes
bounding
down
the
like
a
loosened
boulder
till
he
reaches
the
cluster
of
cottages
far
below
in
an
instant
all
is
activity
and
bustle
the
men
spring
into
the
boats
lying
ready
at
the
little
wharves
the
boys
tumble
in
after
them
the
wives
and
daughters
fling
their
aprons
over
their
heads
to
keep
off
the
sun
and
run
out
to
the
end
of
the
wharves
or
climb
up
on
the
flakes
so
that
they
may
see
as
much
as
possible
in
a
minute
more
the
boats
are
heading
for
the
mackerel
as
fast
as
brawny
arms
can
drive
them
half
a
mile
away
the
calm
blue
water
is
dark
and
disturbed
for
a
space
about
the
size
of
an
ordinary
it
looks
in
fact
as
if
it
were
boiling
and
bubbling
just
there
though
all
around
is
still
and
smooth
toward
this
spot
the
boats
are
hurried
presently
they
reach
it
then
they
stop
one
of
the
smaller
boats
goes
up
to
the
long
craft
that
carries
the
seine
and
takes
one
end
of
the
net
on
board
everything
is
done
quietly
for
the
fish
are
easily
frightened
and
if
alarmed
will
sink
right
down
into
the
deep
water
where
they
can
not
be
got
at
as
quickly
as
sinewy
arms
can
send
her
along
the
small
boat
describes
a
circle
round
the
fish
that
continue
to
frisk
about
all
unconscious
of
their
peril
at
length
a
shout
of
joy
announces
that
connection
has
been
made
the
two
ends
of
the
seine
are
joined
and
if
it
be
a
the
bottom
is
drawn
together
also
and
then
the
tired
excited
fishermen
can
take
a
little
rest
and
they
try
to
guess
how
many
barrels
this
stop
of
mackerel
will
make
jack
hays
and
the
rest
of
the
boys
can
hardly
contain
themselves
with
delight
for
they
all
have
a
trip
up
to
the
city
so
soon
as
the
fish
are
ready
to
be
sold
and
these
trips
are
the
great
events
of
their
life
having
got
the
fish
nicely
caught
inside
the
seine
the
next
thing
is
to
get
them
out
again
the
big
net
with
its
precious
load
is
drawn
as
near
the
shore
as
possible
the
boats
crowd
round
it
and
a
busy
scene
ensues
as
the
beauties
are
taken
from
the
meshes
and
piled
up
in
the
boats
until
these
little
craft
can
hold
no
more
in
a
little
while
all
the
fish
are
safely
on
shore
and
then
comes
the
splitting
and
salting
in
which
not
only
the
boys
but
the
girls
and
their
mothers
too
take
a
hand
for
the
more
quickly
it
is
done
the
better
the
dexterity
shown
by
the
workers
is
astonishing
holding
a
sharp
knife
in
their
right
hand
they
stand
before
a
pile
of
glistening
mackerel
with
one
motion
they
seize
a
fine
fat
fellow
with
another
they
split
him
open
from
head
to
tail
with
a
third
they
despoil
him
of
his
entire
digestive
apparatus
with
a
fourth
they
put
in
its
place
a
handful
of
salt
with
a
fifth
fling
him
upon
a
pile
beside
them
and
the
whole
operation
is
done
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
to
see
the
girls
at
none
are
more
expert
than
a
good
deal
of
the
romance
out
of
ideas
of
but
it
can
not
be
helped
they
can
not
afford
to
be
romantic
or
look
picturesque
their
life
is
too
hard
for
that
kind
of
amusement
in
the
catching
of
mackerel
and
herring
there
is
not
much
danger
and
the
fishermen
need
not
go
far
from
home
but
it
is
different
with
the
cod
and
haddock
and
hake
to
get
these
big
fellows
you
must
go
out
upon
the
banks
as
those
strange
shallow
areas
in
the
atlantic
ocean
are
called
and
going
out
upon
the
banks
means
being
away
for
long
weeks
at
a
time
and
exposed
to
many
dangers
storms
are
frequent
there
and
the
waves
run
mountain
high
so
that
stanch
and
trim
as
the
fishing
craft
are
and
thoroughly
expert
their
masters
hardly
a
season
passes
without
the
loss
of
a
or
with
all
on
board
often
alas
do
the
women
go
weeping
and
wringing
their
hands
for
those
who
will
never
come
back
to
the
town
another
danger
ever
present
ever
indeed
growing
greater
is
that
of
being
run
down
some
foggy
night
by
the
great
ocean
steamers
that
are
thronging
past
in
increasing
numbers
picture
to
yourself
a
dense
dark
night
when
you
can
hardly
see
your
hand
before
your
face
a
little
schooner
tossing
at
anchor
on
the
banks
all
but
one
of
her
crew
asleep
in
their
bunks
suddenly
there
falls
upon
the
solitary
ear
a
sound
that
thrills
him
with
terror
it
is
the
throbbing
of
mighty
engines
and
the
onward
rush
of
an
ocean
greyhound
as
she
spurns
the
foaming
water
from
her
bows
springing
upon
the
poop
he
shouts
with
all
his
might
the
crew
below
leap
from
their
berths
and
though
only
half
awake
join
him
in
the
cry
but
it
is
of
no
avail
the
light
is
seen
by
the
too
late
to
change
her
course
there
is
a
splintering
crash
the
iron
monster
feels
a
slight
shock
hardly
enough
to
waken
the
lightest
sleeper
in
her
staterooms
and
the
sharp
prow
cuts
through
the
little
schooner
as
though
it
were
but
another
wave
then
the
frenzied
shrieks
of
strong
men
in
their
agony
ring
out
upon
the
midnight
air
then
all
is
silent
again
and
the
steamer
speeds
on
to
her
destination
while
to
another
home
in
herring
cove
comes
the
dreadful
experience
of
which
the
poet
says
how
much
of
wasted
strength
of
misery
what
breaking
hearts
might
swell
the
cry
dear
fish
to
me
yet
it
is
the
ambition
of
every
boy
at
herring
cove
or
shad
bay
to
have
a
share
in
a
banker
or
better
still
to
own
one
all
by
himself
and
to
this
he
looks
forward
just
as
city
boys
do
to
being
bank
presidents
or
judges
or
editors
of
newspapers
hard
work
much
danger
a
little
schooling
and
still
less
playing
is
the
summary
of
a
life
it
makes
him
very
healthy
brown
and
strong
but
it
never
makes
him
rich
the
most
he
can
do
is
to
earn
enough
to
build
and
furnish
a
cottage
when
he
marries
and
provide
plain
food
and
coarse
clothing
for
the
family
that
soon
springs
up
around
him
now
and
is
whenever
he
has
fish
to
goes
up
to
the
city
and
this
is
his
only
holiday
while
still
a
boy
he
generally
behaves
himself
well
enough
on
these
visits
but
growing
older
he
does
not
always
grow
wiser
i
am
sorry
to
say
and
i
have
often
seen
wives
rowing
the
heavy
boat
wearily
home
while
their
husbands
lay
in
the
in
a
drunken
stupor
on
the
limits
a
christmas
story
i
wish
you
had
taken
my
advice
and
stayed
at
the
shanty
harry
the
speaker
was
a
stalwart
young
man
so
closely
wrapped
in
a
blue
blanket
capote
that
only
a
portion
of
his
face
showed
itself
and
the
one
addressed
was
a
boy
of
sixteen
similarly
accoutred
i
felt
more
than
of
this
storm
overtaking
us
the
young
man
continued
and
now
in
a
pretty
fix
i
imagine
how
ever
reach
the
depot
there
was
something
so
despondent
in
his
tone
that
one
might
have
expected
his
words
to
exercise
a
dispiriting
effect
upon
his
companion
but
instead
of
that
harry
answered
brightly
reach
the
depot
of
course
we
will
and
in
good
time
for
our
christmas
dinner
too
you
worry
on
my
account
maynard
if
anything
should
happen
it
would
be
all
my
own
fault
you
know
you
be
the
least
bit
to
blame
maynard
shook
his
head
negatively
very
good
of
you
to
say
so
harry
but
i
help
feeling
responsible
all
the
same
oh
he
cried
with
a
gesture
of
irritated
protest
against
the
situation
what
a
plague
this
snow
is
surely
we
had
enough
of
it
already
and
need
this
storm
john
maynard
was
the
bush
superintendent
on
one
of
the
great
timber
limits
of
booth
and
bronson
the
millionaire
lumbermen
of
canada
the
duty
devolved
upon
him
of
driving
about
from
one
shanty
as
the
permanent
camps
of
the
are
called
to
another
taking
account
of
the
work
done
and
giving
directions
as
to
the
bunches
of
timber
next
to
be
attacked
this
was
a
very
arduous
occupation
entailing
as
it
did
long
and
lonely
drives
through
forest
roads
passable
only
in
winter
across
the
broad
bosoms
of
frozen
lakes
and
along
the
winding
courses
of
rivers
for
this
purpose
he
had
a
pair
of
powerful
horses
and
a
low
strong
sleigh
made
altogether
of
wood
that
had
accommodation
for
just
two
persons
and
some
baggage
as
a
rule
he
made
these
journeys
alone
but
this
winter
he
had
been
favoured
with
a
companion
in
harry
bronson
the
eldest
son
of
a
member
of
the
firm
who
had
asked
permission
to
spend
the
winter
at
the
shanties
his
request
had
been
readily
granted
for
he
would
have
to
take
his
place
in
the
business
in
due
time
and
the
more
thoroughly
he
knew
its
details
the
better
consequently
bronson
was
very
glad
to
let
him
go
while
harry
rejoiced
at
getting
away
from
the
confinement
of
the
office
and
at
the
prospect
of
having
some
exciting
experiences
before
he
returned
so
far
he
had
been
having
a
very
good
time
john
maynard
was
as
pleasant
a
companion
as
he
was
a
competent
bush
superintendent
and
while
going
the
round
of
the
shanties
there
were
many
chances
for
shots
at
partridges
or
rabbits
and
always
the
exciting
possibility
of
encountering
a
bear
then
at
the
shanties
their
welcome
was
always
so
warm
and
the
shantymen
were
so
amusing
with
their
exhaustless
fund
of
song
and
dance
and
story
that
harry
never
knew
what
it
was
to
feel
dull
for
a
moment
christmas
week
found
him
at
the
shanty
on
the
one
that
stood
farthest
away
of
all
from
the
depot
at
which
maynard
made
his
headquarters
and
to
which
it
was
his
intention
to
return
in
time
to
celebrate
christmas
there
the
superintendent
was
particularly
anxious
to
get
back
by
that
time
because
having
completed
a
round
of
the
shanties
he
could
leave
them
unvisited
for
a
fortnight
or
so
and
he
proposed
to
spend
christmas
week
in
montreal
where
he
had
many
friends
harry
on
his
part
was
hardly
less
anxious
to
get
to
the
depot
for
although
he
did
not
intend
going
any
further
he
had
been
promised
lots
of
fun
there
by
the
clerk
in
charge
and
a
christmas
dinner
into
the
bargain
accordingly
when
certain
infallible
signs
of
a
change
for
the
worse
in
the
weather
which
had
hitherto
been
almost
perfect
made
their
appearance
and
maynard
willing
to
take
any
risk
himself
but
reluctant
to
expose
harry
to
danger
suggested
that
the
boy
should
remain
at
the
opeongo
shanty
until
the
threatened
storm
passed
and
then
get
back
to
the
depot
by
one
of
the
ordinary
teams
harry
would
not
hear
of
it
no
no
maynard
said
he
stoutly
if
you
can
stand
the
storm
i
can
too
going
with
you
clearly
enough
the
superintendent
would
have
to
either
allow
harry
to
accompany
him
or
stay
at
the
shanty
himself
he
could
not
accept
the
latter
alternative
so
he
replied
very
well
then
my
boy
start
and
if
bad
weather
catches
us
have
to
do
the
best
we
can
the
distance
between
the
opeongo
shanty
and
the
depot
as
the
crow
flies
was
fifty
miles
but
the
circuitous
route
that
was
necessary
in
order
to
avoid
ranges
of
rocky
hills
and
impassable
gullies
made
it
full
half
as
long
again
and
in
view
of
the
state
of
the
road
maynard
calculated
that
two
days
might
be
required
to
make
their
destination
accordingly
they
set
out
in
the
morning
of
the
second
day
before
christmas
it
hardly
needed
the
practised
eye
of
a
to
foretell
a
coming
change
in
the
weather
the
bright
face
was
hidden
behind
a
dense
veil
of
sullen
clouds
the
air
that
had
been
so
crisp
and
clear
seemed
dank
and
heavy
like
a
and
both
man
and
beast
moved
about
in
a
listless
way
as
if
every
movement
was
an
effort
more
than
once
the
mind
misgave
him
ere
they
had
gone
many
miles
he
was
naturally
a
cautious
man
not
disposed
to
run
unnecessary
risks
although
utterly
regardless
of
personal
peril
in
any
matter
of
duty
not
that
he
felt
any
concern
on
his
own
account
but
he
would
have
felt
much
easier
in
his
mind
had
harry
been
persuaded
to
stay
at
the
shanty
yet
how
could
he
reasonably
expect
that
when
he
himself
was
pushing
on
to
the
depot
argument
that
if
the
superintendent
could
stand
the
storm
he
could
also
was
not
easy
to
answer
and
it
prevailed
if
this
confounded
road
was
only
in
better
shape
we
might
get
there
said
maynard
impatiently
that
afternoon
as
the
sleigh
slowly
toiled
up
a
steep
ascent
the
horses
sinking
above
their
fetlocks
in
the
fine
dry
snow
at
every
step
had
their
way
been
as
well
broken
as
a
city
street
they
might
indeed
have
accomplished
this
feat
but
under
the
circumstances
the
best
they
could
hope
for
was
to
reach
the
depot
early
on
christmas
eve
harry
understanding
that
he
was
the
chief
object
of
the
concern
felt
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
take
as
hopeful
a
view
of
matters
as
possible
so
he
responded
in
his
cheeriest
tone
oh
get
there
afternoon
right
enough
more
than
half
way
to
wolf
hollow
now
we
yes
a
good
bit
more
but
the
snow
beginning
we
must
drive
ahead
as
fast
as
we
can
soon
be
dark
the
horses
accordingly
were
urged
to
the
utmost
speed
possible
and
by
dint
of
some
rather
reckless
driving
wolf
hollow
was
safely
reached
in
the
face
of
a
blinding
snowstorm
ere
the
darkness
fell
at
this
place
there
stood
a
shanty
which
had
been
abandoned
some
years
before
all
the
timber
being
cut
in
the
neighbourhood
and
here
maynard
proposed
to
spend
the
night
the
building
was
found
to
be
in
good
in
it
did
not
take
long
to
gather
an
abundant
supply
of
firewood
wherewith
to
expel
the
cold
damp
air
that
filled
it
the
horses
could
not
be
left
out
of
course
exposed
to
the
pitiless
storm
so
they
were
allotted
the
farthest
corner
of
the
long
low
room
the
sleigh
too
was
brought
inside
with
all
its
contents
a
substantial
supper
was
prepared
and
enjoyed
the
horses
were
given
a
good
feed
of
oats
and
then
both
the
travellers
being
thoroughly
tired
they
fitted
up
one
of
the
bunks
with
the
sleigh
robes
and
so
as
to
waste
no
heat
lay
down
side
by
side
and
were
soon
sound
asleep
at
daybreak
the
superintendent
got
up
and
hastened
to
see
how
matters
looked
outside
the
prospect
was
anything
but
cheering
snow
had
been
falling
heavily
all
night
and
there
seemed
no
sign
of
its
ceasing
all
marks
of
the
road
were
completely
obliterated
and
it
would
evidently
test
to
the
utmost
his
knowledge
of
woodcraft
to
keep
in
the
right
track
such
was
the
condition
of
affairs
that
called
forth
the
exclamation
reported
at
the
beginning
of
this
story
however
there
was
nothing
to
gain
by
delay
so
hardly
waiting
to
snatch
a
bite
of
food
and
to
allow
their
horses
to
finish
their
portion
of
oats
they
harnessed
up
and
drove
forth
into
the
storm
even
had
the
track
been
easily
distinguishable
they
could
not
have
made
rapid
progress
for
the
snow
came
in
big
blinding
flakes
that
were
very
bewildering
and
had
already
covered
the
ground
to
a
depth
of
nearly
a
foot
by
the
aid
of
familiar
landmarks
maynard
was
able
for
a
time
to
direct
their
course
accurately
enough
but
about
they
reached
a
wide
lake
which
they
had
to
cross
and
here
their
real
difficulties
began
the
broad
expanse
of
loon
lake
had
presented
a
fine
playground
for
the
wind
and
upon
it
the
snow
was
heaped
in
vast
drifts
far
surpassing
anything
met
with
in
the
woods
where
the
trees
afforded
protection
in
these
drifts
the
horses
and
sleigh
soon
stuck
so
fast
that
their
extrication
was
evidently
quite
beyond
the
power
of
the
passengers
there
seemed
no
alternative
but
to
abandon
them
to
their
fate
and
to
continue
the
journey
on
which
fortunately
were
lashed
to
the
back
of
the
sleigh
maynard
felt
sorely
reluctant
to
desert
his
faithful
horses
but
no
time
could
be
spared
for
unavailing
regrets
no
help
for
it
harry
he
said
resolutely
have
to
leave
them
where
they
are
we
can
not
get
them
out
and
enough
to
do
to
look
after
ourselves
the
poor
creatures
whinnied
appealingly
as
their
human
companions
moved
off
and
made
frantic
efforts
to
follow
but
the
remorseless
held
them
fast
illustration
the
poor
creatures
whinnied
appealingly
it
was
certainly
a
pity
to
leave
two
such
fine
animals
to
perish
but
yet
what
could
be
done
striding
along
on
the
in
the
use
of
which
they
were
both
expert
the
superintendent
and
harry
made
better
progress
than
they
had
been
doing
in
the
sleigh
and
now
the
chief
anxiety
was
to
hit
the
right
spot
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
where
the
road
continued
through
the
woods
on
a
clear
day
maynard
would
have
found
little
difficulty
in
doing
this
but
in
the
midst
of
a
blinding
snowstorm
it
was
no
easy
task
yet
their
very
lives
depended
upon
its
successful
accomplishment
when
they
reached
the
middle
of
the
lake
they
were
dismayed
to
discover
that
the
snow
shrouded
not
only
the
shore
for
which
they
were
making
but
the
one
which
they
had
left
they
were
absolutely
without
a
mark
to
guide
them
here
was
an
unexpected
peril
maynard
halted
and
strove
to
peer
through
the
ominous
obscurity
of
white
but
on
every
side
it
was
the
same
what
are
we
to
do
now
harry
he
cried
in
a
tone
of
deep
concern
i
make
out
our
way
at
all
by
this
time
spirits
which
had
hitherto
been
keeping
up
bravely
were
beginning
to
fall
for
he
was
growing
weary
of
the
long
struggle
with
the
storm
sure
i
know
he
responded
ruefully
i
suppose
there
is
nothing
else
to
do
but
to
push
ahead
and
take
our
chances
of
hitting
the
shore
somewhere
about
all
harry
was
the
reply
just
rest
a
minute
to
get
your
breath
and
then
make
a
dash
for
it
for
a
little
space
they
stood
still
and
silent
the
mind
of
each
absorbed
in
anxious
thought
and
then
maynard
called
out
come
along
now
harry
keep
right
in
my
tracks
and
see
if
i
make
the
shore
all
right
for
they
toiled
steadily
onward
and
well
it
was
for
both
that
they
had
such
skill
in
the
use
of
without
them
they
could
not
have
made
a
hundred
headway
so
heavy
was
the
snow
even
as
it
was
the
hard
work
told
upon
harry
and
presently
he
had
to
call
to
his
companion
hold
on
a
minute
maynard
out
of
breath
the
superintendent
stopped
short
and
came
back
to
him
not
played
out
already
are
you
harry
he
asked
peering
anxiously
into
his
face
oh
no
and
the
boy
made
a
gallant
effort
at
a
reassuring
smile
i
just
want
to
get
my
wind
all
this
abominable
storm
nearly
suffocates
me
as
they
rested
again
for
a
few
minutes
the
wind
suddenly
shifted
parting
the
whirling
snow
to
right
and
left
and
through
the
rift
thus
made
keen
eyes
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
dark
mass
rising
dimly
into
the
air
a
little
more
than
a
mile
away
with
a
shout
of
joy
he
slapped
his
companion
upon
the
back
crying
eagle
rock
harry
see
and
he
pointed
with
a
quivering
finger
to
the
spectral
appearance
once
we
make
that
i
can
find
the
road
all
right
enough
come
along
cheered
by
the
sight
which
the
next
moment
the
again
hid
from
them
they
pushed
forward
with
renewed
energy
it
was
terribly
hard
walking
their
sank
deep
into
the
drifts
at
every
step
and
it
was
an
effort
each
time
to
release
them
the
afternoon
was
also
waning
fast
and
they
had
not
more
than
an
hour
of
daylight
left
at
best
truly
they
were
in
desperate
straits
on
they
went
over
the
drifts
that
seemed
to
be
determined
to
bar
their
way
the
superintendent
straining
his
eyes
for
another
glimpse
of
eagle
rock
at
last
as
harry
was
about
once
more
to
cry
halt
his
companion
exclaimed
joyfully
eagle
rock
harry
i
see
it
making
straight
for
it
a
few
minutes
more
will
take
us
there
the
cheering
announcement
revived
the
failing
energies
for
another
effort
he
shut
his
lips
upon
the
request
for
a
rest
and
doggedly
tramped
on
after
his
guide
ten
minutes
more
and
they
were
at
the
foot
of
the
lofty
crag
called
eagle
rock
in
a
friendly
recess
of
which
they
found
welcome
shelter
from
the
furious
wind
thank
goodness
ejaculated
harry
throwing
himself
wearily
down
upon
a
got
thus
far
anyway
how
many
miles
more
mr
maynard
about
ten
harry
was
the
answer
given
in
quite
a
tone
ten
echoed
harry
in
dismay
i
hoped
it
would
only
be
about
five
never
do
it
in
the
world
oh
yes
you
will
my
boy
replied
maynard
help
you
you
know
to
their
vast
relief
the
snow
now
began
to
abate
and
presently
ceased
falling
altogether
something
to
be
thankful
for
said
the
superintendent
are
you
ready
to
start
again
go
ahead
was
the
response
but
no
sooner
had
one
danger
passed
than
another
presented
itself
the
light
began
to
fail
for
night
was
at
hand
a
tramp
on
through
a
desolate
forest
was
not
much
to
be
desired
under
any
circumstances
to
accomplish
it
in
the
dark
tired
as
they
both
felt
already
was
a
feat
the
achieving
of
which
seemed
more
than
doubtful
maynard
had
his
misgivings
but
he
carefully
concealed
them
from
his
companion
and
even
started
whistling
a
lively
march
as
he
led
the
way
along
the
faintly
discernible
road
never
will
either
of
them
ever
forget
that
awful
tramp
the
night
soon
enfolded
them
leaving
only
the
scant
light
of
the
glimmering
stars
for
guidance
every
step
they
took
had
to
be
carefully
considered
lest
they
should
stray
from
the
track
and
be
hopelessly
lost
again
and
again
the
silence
through
which
they
marched
was
broken
by
the
cry
of
the
lynx
or
the
dismal
howl
of
the
wolf
seeking
what
they
might
devour
the
rifle
hung
at
his
back
and
harry
had
a
good
revolver
but
they
prayed
in
their
hearts
that
they
might
have
no
occasion
to
use
them
every
little
while
they
had
to
pause
that
the
boy
might
take
a
brief
rest
then
on
they
went
again
mile
after
mile
of
the
dreary
toilsome
way
was
slowly
yet
steadily
overcome
each
one
adding
to
poor
weariness
until
he
felt
as
if
he
must
give
up
the
struggle
and
throw
himself
down
in
the
snow
to
die
but
maynard
cheered
him
up
and
helped
him
and
kept
him
going
knowing
well
that
to
give
up
really
meant
death
at
last
the
exhausted
boy
sank
down
with
a
piteous
wail
no
use
maynard
i
take
another
step
oh
yes
you
can
harry
said
the
superintendent
soothingly
just
take
a
little
rest
and
then
be
all
right
while
harry
rested
he
went
on
ahead
a
short
distance
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
could
not
be
very
far
from
the
depot
presently
there
came
from
him
a
glad
hurrah
and
running
back
he
put
his
arm
around
his
companion
and
helped
him
to
his
feet
exclaiming
joyfully
i
can
see
a
light
harry
safe
now
the
depot
and
he
was
right
they
were
within
half
a
mile
of
their
haven
forgetting
all
their
weariness
they
put
on
a
gallant
spurt
and
in
less
than
ten
minutes
were
in
the
midst
of
their
friends
telling
the
story
of
their
thrilling
experience
well
that
ends
well
the
superintendent
kept
his
appointments
in
the
city
harry
had
a
royal
christmas
time
with
the
clerks
in
the
depot
and
happy
to
relate
the
horses
were
not
lost
for
a
relief
party
that
went
out
the
following
morning
with
a
big
sledge
found
them
still
alive
and
brought
them
and
the
sleigh
back
to
the
depot
little
the
worse
for
the
long
imprisonment
in
the
strange
helper
nothing
for
it
maggie
but
to
let
the
place
go
tried
my
best
to
raise
the
money
but
those
that
are
willing
to
help
a
fellow
it
to
lend
and
those
that
have
it
willing
to
help
mighty
hard
lines
i
tell
you
and
with
a
groan
of
despair
alec
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
as
he
leaned
heavily
upon
the
table
hard
lines
it
was
indeed
as
no
one
knew
better
than
moses
shearer
the
to
whose
conduct
was
due
alec
the
anguish
of
mind
he
had
chosen
that
particular
time
for
enforcing
satisfaction
of
his
claim
because
he
understood
that
it
could
not
be
done
without
a
sale
of
the
mill
property
and
this
was
just
what
he
desired
as
he
intended
to
bid
it
in
for
himself
it
did
seem
a
cruel
thing
for
to
be
sold
out
of
the
snug
mill
that
represented
his
whole
fortune
and
all
for
a
debt
of
one
hundred
pounds
incurred
under
special
circumstances
for
which
he
was
in
no
wise
to
blame
no
wonder
that
he
was
sorely
cast
down
and
that
gloom
reigned
in
his
household
which
consisted
of
a
devoted
wife
and
two
the
elder
a
sturdy
enterprising
lad
of
fourteen
and
jessie
a
sweet
lassie
two
years
younger
they
were
all
in
the
room
when
the
miller
gave
voice
to
his
despair
and
rob
full
of
sympathy
hastened
to
say
something
comforting
with
all
the
hopefulness
of
youth
give
up
yet
father
said
he
the
sale
is
more
than
a
week
off
and
you
may
be
able
to
get
the
money
somehow
before
then
shook
his
head
without
raising
it
from
his
hands
he
had
exhausted
every
available
resource
and
saw
no
way
in
which
help
could
come
he
was
not
a
religious
man
although
of
unblemished
integrity
of
character
and
had
no
faith
to
sustain
him
in
his
grievous
trial
nor
did
his
wife
know
how
to
lay
hold
upon
god
and
claim
the
fulfilment
of
his
promises
in
this
they
both
had
much
to
learn
from
their
own
children
for
thanks
to
sound
teaching
in
sunday
school
rob
and
jessie
believed
in
the
prayer
of
faith
they
believed
god
was
always
ready
and
willing
to
respond
in
his
wisdom
to
the
petitions
of
his
children
and
when
they
learned
of
their
trouble
their
thoughts
took
the
same
direction
that
night
when
rob
went
up
to
his
room
he
found
jessie
there
o
rob
she
hastened
to
say
been
waiting
for
you
to
come
what
do
you
want
to
do
jessie
inquired
rob
why
rob
you
know
when
father
told
us
of
his
trouble
i
made
up
my
mind
to
ask
god
to
help
him
out
of
it
what
is
that
in
the
bible
about
god
doing
anything
that
two
of
his
people
agree
to
ask
for
proud
of
his
memory
rob
promptly
repeated
the
verse
if
two
of
you
shall
agree
on
earth
as
touching
anything
that
they
shall
ask
it
shall
be
done
for
them
yes
it
exclaimed
jessie
now
then
rob
we
agree
to
ask
god
to
help
father
to
pay
off
that
dreadful
mr
shearer
of
course
we
can
responded
rob
heartily
and
do
it
right
away
so
down
on
their
knees
they
went
and
each
in
turn
presented
an
earnest
simple
petition
to
god
that
aid
should
be
granted
their
father
in
the
present
emergency
when
they
rose
their
faces
were
radiant
it
will
be
all
right
now
it
rob
said
jessie
as
she
went
to
her
own
room
the
following
day
passed
without
any
sign
of
an
answer
and
so
did
the
next
rob
began
to
grow
impatient
but
jessie
was
more
trustful
each
night
they
renewed
their
united
requests
on
the
third
night
rob
the
window
of
whose
room
overlooked
the
happening
to
awake
about
midnight
thought
he
heard
a
most
unusual
splashing
noise
coming
from
the
pond
sitting
up
in
bed
and
listening
attentively
he
asked
himself
what
can
it
be
has
somebody
fallen
into
the
pond
no
it
be
that
or
there
would
be
cries
for
help
oh
only
some
old
cow
fooling
around
he
was
about
to
accept
this
explanation
and
settle
down
to
sleep
again
when
there
was
added
to
the
frantic
splashing
a
hoarse
bellow
such
as
no
domestic
animal
ever
uttered
i
must
see
what
that
is
said
he
to
himself
so
out
of
bed
he
jumped
hurried
on
his
clothes
and
slipping
quietly
out
of
the
house
hastened
across
the
yard
to
the
from
which
he
could
command
a
view
of
the
whole
pond
it
was
a
bright
clear
night
with
the
moon
at
the
full
and
the
still
waters
of
the
pond
reflected
its
silver
rays
like
a
huge
mirror
at
first
the
boy
could
see
nothing
to
account
for
the
strange
noises
he
had
heard
but
presently
he
discovered
a
big
creature
whose
exact
nature
he
could
not
make
out
in
the
deepest
part
of
the
pond
where
surrounded
by
the
floating
logs
which
had
rendered
futile
all
its
efforts
to
extricate
itself
it
was
for
the
moment
resting
quietly
as
though
exhausted
appearance
upon
the
platform
evidently
aroused
the
creature
to
fresh
exertions
and
it
proceeded
to
fling
itself
about
with
reckless
fury
in
the
course
of
which
its
head
emerged
from
the
shadow
into
a
broad
band
of
light
and
with
a
cry
of
astonishment
rob
who
had
been
bending
over
the
edge
of
the
platform
sprang
to
his
feet
why
a
moose
he
exclaimed
and
a
monster
one
too
and
going
to
catch
him
then
looking
down
at
the
imprisoned
animal
he
added
just
stay
there
my
beauty
be
back
in
a
jiffy
to
look
after
you
darting
over
to
the
house
he
quickly
aroused
his
father
who
as
soon
as
he
had
assured
himself
that
his
story
was
correct
hastened
to
call
up
some
of
the
neighbours
he
did
not
stop
to
think
what
he
would
do
with
the
moose
when
he
had
him
safely
secured
he
was
merely
glad
of
a
diversion
that
would
help
him
to
forget
his
troubles
for
a
while
but
rob
already
had
a
scheme
worked
out
in
his
mind
of
which
however
he
intended
to
say
nothing
until
the
capture
had
been
successfully
accomplished
then
he
would
let
it
be
known
the
neighbours
responded
readily
to
summons
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
men
were
upon
the
scene
some
armed
with
pitchforks
others
with
stakes
and
all
eager
to
have
a
share
in
the
honours
of
the
capture
many
and
various
were
the
suggestions
as
to
the
best
plan
for
getting
the
animal
out
of
the
pond
uninjured
but
no
sooner
had
offered
his
than
it
was
unanimously
adopted
as
the
best
by
pushing
away
the
logs
a
clear
space
could
be
made
leading
to
the
incline
up
which
the
logs
were
drawn
to
meet
their
fate
at
the
teeth
and
the
idea
was
to
lasso
the
moose
by
the
antlers
drag
the
creature
through
the
water
to
the
foot
of
the
incline
then
attach
the
rope
to
the
chain
for
drawing
up
the
logs
and
turn
on
the
the
strongest
animal
that
ever
stood
on
four
legs
could
not
resist
the
tug
of
the
chain
and
thus
the
moose
would
be
drawn
up
on
the
platform
and
kept
there
a
safe
prisoner
until
he
could
be
removed
to
the
barn
had
little
difficulty
in
getting
the
rope
fastened
to
the
big
branching
antlers
and
not
much
more
in
towing
his
captive
around
to
the
foot
of
the
incline
but
then
came
the
rub
the
monarch
of
the
forest
fought
frantically
against
being
drawn
out
of
the
water
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
might
kill
himself
in
his
desperate
efforts
for
freedom
illustration
capturing
the
moose
there
was
no
resisting
the
inexorable
strain
of
the
however
and
foot
by
foot
he
was
compelled
to
ascend
the
incline
until
he
reached
the
platform
then
the
power
was
shut
off
and
decided
that
it
was
best
to
allow
the
great
creature
to
stay
where
he
was
until
daylight
the
men
all
went
back
to
their
beds
but
rob
remained
he
did
not
want
to
leave
the
prize
which
had
thus
strangely
fallen
into
his
hands
and
which
he
hoped
to
make
signally
helpful
in
his
trouble
so
he
chose
a
corner
of
the
platform
where
he
could
keep
the
moose
in
full
view
and
composed
himself
to
wait
for
the
morning
as
he
sat
there
his
heart
went
up
in
gratitude
to
god
for
right
before
him
had
he
not
the
answer
to
the
prayer
he
and
jessie
had
united
in
offering
with
the
dawn
and
the
other
men
returned
and
by
dint
of
much
shouting
flourishing
of
pitchforks
and
tugging
of
ropes
the
moose
after
many
furious
attempts
at
breaking
away
was
at
length
safely
conveyed
to
the
barn
and
securely
fastened
up
in
such
a
manner
that
he
could
do
himself
no
hurt
struggle
and
kick
as
he
might
hip
hip
hurrah
shouted
rob
as
the
big
door
closed
with
a
bang
and
he
flung
himself
against
it
to
make
sure
that
it
was
shut
tight
got
him
all
right
enough
he
get
out
of
there
until
we
want
him
and
now
that
you
have
got
him
robby
said
the
miller
laying
his
hand
affectionately
on
the
shoulder
perhaps
tell
us
what
you
are
going
to
do
with
him
up
to
this
point
rob
had
kept
his
own
counsel
because
his
scotch
shrewdness
told
him
it
would
be
best
to
do
so
until
the
capture
was
successfully
effected
but
now
there
was
no
longer
need
for
reserve
you
remember
that
gentleman
who
was
here
hunting
last
winter
you
father
said
he
looking
up
eagerly
into
face
you
mean
professor
owen
from
new
york
yes
well
you
know
he
said
give
a
hundred
pounds
for
a
moose
alive
and
now
you
must
write
and
tell
him
got
a
beauty
for
him
and
to
come
along
and
get
it
the
face
became
radiant
as
his
son
spoke
he
now
understood
what
had
been
in
mind
and
why
he
had
shown
such
intense
anxiety
to
secure
the
moose
uninjured
god
bless
you
my
boy
he
exclaimed
throwing
his
arms
around
his
neck
for
the
revulsion
of
feeling
broke
down
his
characteristic
reserve
i
see
what
been
driving
at
you
always
were
a
bright
lad
and
now
maybe
going
to
save
me
from
ruin
i
wait
to
write
professor
owen
telegraph
him
he
left
me
his
address
so
that
i
might
let
him
know
when
the
hunting
was
good
mounting
his
best
horse
hastened
to
the
village
and
sent
this
despatch
to
the
professor
have
a
splendid
live
moose
in
my
barn
do
you
want
him
before
many
hours
the
reply
came
am
coming
for
him
by
first
train
the
following
evening
professor
owen
appeared
when
he
saw
the
moose
he
fairly
shouted
with
delight
a
perfect
specimen
and
in
the
very
prime
of
life
he
cried
give
you
a
hundred
pounds
for
him
on
the
spot
will
that
be
right
the
offer
was
gladly
accepted
and
as
soon
as
the
necessary
arrangements
could
be
made
the
moose
was
taken
away
to
become
the
chief
attraction
in
a
famous
zoological
garden
on
the
day
before
the
sale
greatly
to
the
chagrin
paid
his
claim
in
full
and
cleared
his
property
from
all
encumbrance
that
night
they
had
a
at
the
mill
for
when
was
told
about
rob
and
jessie
praying
together
for
his
deliverance
from
the
grasp
of
moses
shearer
his
heart
was
deeply
stirred
and
he
joined
in
thanking
god
who
had
thus
signally
answered
the
petitions
not
only
so
but
both
he
and
his
wife
were
moved
to
withhold
no
longer
from
service
and
they
became
active
happy
members
of
the
church
as
for
rob
and
jessie
their
faith
was
wonderfully
strengthened
and
often
afterwards
the
recollection
of
this
incident
helped
them
to
be
trustful
in
the
midst
of
many
difficulties
miles
of
maelstrom
the
canadian
pacific
train
speeding
swiftly
on
toward
winnipeg
had
just
dashed
over
an
iron
bridge
which
threw
its
audacious
across
a
foaming
torrent
pointing
down
at
the
tumbling
water
beneath
one
of
the
men
in
the
smoking
compartment
of
a
palace
car
exclaimed
like
to
try
that
rapid
in
my
are
you
so
fond
of
a
wetting
as
all
that
asked
charlie
hall
with
a
smile
oh
risk
the
wetting
been
through
worse
rapids
than
that
without
so
much
as
being
sprinkled
he
proceeded
to
support
his
assertion
by
relating
some
of
his
adventures
when
jack
fleming
came
to
the
end
of
his
tether
the
others
had
their
say
for
they
had
not
been
without
experiences
of
a
similar
nature
meanwhile
the
fourth
member
of
the
group
had
been
listening
with
interested
attention
as
if
their
stories
were
so
novel
that
he
did
not
wish
to
lose
a
word
of
them
he
was
merely
a
chance
acquaintance
who
had
fallen
into
conversation
with
his
through
the
freemasonry
of
the
pipe
they
knew
his
name
ronald
cameron
but
they
knew
nothing
more
about
him
it
was
more
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
courteous
than
with
any
idea
of
drawing
the
stranger
out
that
fleming
turned
to
him
and
said
perhaps
you
know
something
about
running
rapids
too
the
bronzed
face
broke
out
into
a
smile
which
meant
unmistakably
as
well
ask
grant
if
he
knew
something
about
fighting
battles
but
there
was
not
the
faintest
trace
of
boastfulness
in
his
tone
as
he
replied
i
have
run
a
few
rapids
in
my
time
well
your
turn
now
tell
us
your
experience
said
fleming
and
without
much
urging
cameron
began
i
must
explain
that
i
am
in
the
employ
of
the
hudson
bay
company
and
have
spent
many
years
in
the
districts
my
duties
have
required
frequent
long
trips
by
york
boat
and
bark
canoe
in
the
course
of
which
i
have
had
my
full
share
of
tussles
with
rapids
of
all
kinds
i
could
tell
you
rather
exciting
little
episodes
but
give
you
only
one
just
now
namely
my
passage
of
the
long
cañon
of
the
liard
in
a
canvas
boat
in
a
canvas
boat
broke
out
fleming
half
incredulously
yes
in
a
canvas
boat
repeated
cameron
not
a
particularly
seaworthy
craft
i
must
confess
but
it
was
a
notion
of
my
own
in
order
to
get
over
the
difficulty
in
which
i
was
placed
i
had
been
over
in
british
columbia
and
was
on
my
way
back
to
athabasca
the
season
was
growing
late
and
i
had
only
two
men
with
indian
and
a
the
indian
was
a
splendid
but
the
was
not
of
much
account
the
first
part
of
the
journey
could
be
made
by
boat
easily
enough
but
for
us
three
men
to
drag
a
heavy
boat
over
grizzly
portage
which
is
about
six
miles
long
and
has
a
that
climbs
a
thousand
feet
up
the
mountain
side
was
quite
out
of
the
question
so
before
i
started
i
had
a
boat
made
out
of
tent
canvas
which
would
be
no
trouble
to
carry
the
wooden
boat
was
to
be
left
at
the
head
of
grizzly
portage
to
take
care
of
itself
well
we
got
on
smoothly
until
we
passed
the
portage
and
the
long
cañon
opened
out
before
us
as
i
looked
at
its
wild
rush
of
water
and
realized
that
this
was
only
the
beginning
and
far
from
the
worst
of
it
i
confess
i
felt
tempted
to
turn
back
but
my
pride
soon
banished
that
thought
and
i
set
about
getting
my
frail
craft
ready
for
the
trip
dennazee
the
indian
did
not
show
the
slightest
concern
but
machard
the
was
evidently
much
frightened
assuming
a
cheery
indifference
i
by
no
means
felt
i
went
about
the
work
in
the
most
way
and
with
dennazee
helping
heartily
the
canvas
boat
was
put
together
and
set
afloat
but
it
became
evident
immediately
that
she
was
not
minded
to
stay
afloat
long
although
i
had
taken
the
precaution
to
give
the
canvas
a
good
coat
of
oil
no
sooner
were
we
on
board
than
the
treacherous
stuff
leaked
through
every
pore
clearly
this
must
be
remedied
before
we
could
attempt
the
passage
bidding
the
men
gather
all
the
gum
and
balsam
they
could
find
i
put
the
whole
of
our
bacon
some
ten
pounds
at
least
candles
and
the
gum
and
balsam
into
our
pot
set
it
over
a
brisk
fire
and
produced
the
most
extraordinary
compound
you
can
imagine
with
this
we
thickly
daubed
the
outside
of
the
boat
from
stem
to
stern
and
then
left
her
for
the
night
the
next
morning
she
was
as
tight
as
a
drum
and
we
started
off
the
poor
muttering
prayers
in
full
expectation
of
a
watery
grave
the
indian
as
stolid
as
a
statue
and
myself
much
more
anxious
at
heart
than
i
cared
to
have
either
man
know
the
cañon
is
about
forty
miles
long
and
in
that
distance
the
river
falls
quite
five
hundred
feet
old
lepine
who
has
piloted
boats
up
and
down
the
liard
for
thirty
years
or
more
asserts
that
once
when
the
water
was
unusually
high
he
went
through
the
whole
length
of
the
cañon
in
a
york
boat
in
two
hours
the
old
man
may
be
a
few
minutes
short
of
the
record
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
the
spring
when
the
snow
is
melting
on
the
mountain
slopes
the
river
runs
at
a
fearful
rate
i
had
hoped
for
low
water
but
as
luck
would
have
it
a
sudden
spell
of
intensely
hot
weather
had
set
the
snow
going
and
the
liard
was
just
high
enough
to
be
a
very
ugly
customer
well
we
paddled
out
into
the
current
and
then
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
steer
i
had
the
stern
and
dennazee
the
bow
while
machard
clung
tightly
to
the
centre
thwart
and
was
useful
only
as
ballast
like
an
arrow
our
little
boat
sped
down
stream
darting
this
way
and
that
dipping
and
dancing
about
like
a
cork
doing
exactly
what
the
water
willed
at
the
very
first
swirl
i
found
out
something
that
gave
me
an
additional
shiver
this
was
that
the
boat
could
bear
very
little
pressure
from
the
paddle
if
the
water
pulled
one
way
and
the
paddle
the
other
the
frail
thing
squirmed
and
twisted
like
a
snake
instead
of
obeying
the
steersman
so
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
make
her
respond
readily
or
to
effect
a
sharp
turn
no
doubt
dennazee
discovered
this
as
soon
as
i
did
but
he
gave
no
hint
of
it
as
with
intent
face
and
skilful
arm
he
did
his
part
of
the
work
to
perfection
the
first
few
miles
were
not
very
bad
but
we
soon
came
to
a
place
where
whirlpool
followed
whirlpool
in
fearfully
quick
succession
and
i
no
sooner
caught
my
breath
after
escaping
one
than
we
were
struggling
with
another
our
canvas
appeared
to
undulate
over
the
frothing
waves
rather
than
cut
through
them
i
seemed
to
feel
every
motion
of
the
water
through
her
thin
skin
in
the
very
thick
of
it
i
could
not
help
admiring
the
wonderful
skill
of
the
indian
in
the
bow
again
and
again
he
saved
us
from
dashing
against
a
rock
or
whirling
around
broadside
to
the
current
for
mile
after
mile
we
were
tumbled
about
and
tossed
from
wave
to
wave
like
a
chip
of
bark
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
i
could
scarcely
breathe
my
knees
quaked
though
my
hand
was
firm
as
with
eyes
fixed
upon
dennazee
i
instantly
obeyed
every
motion
of
his
paddle
in
this
fashion
one
hairbreadth
escape
succeeding
another
we
did
half
the
distance
unscathed
and
made
the
shore
by
the
aid
of
an
eddy
at
the
head
of
the
rapids
of
the
drowned
these
rapids
got
their
forbidding
name
from
the
fate
of
eight
voyagers
who
lost
their
lives
while
attempting
to
run
them
in
a
large
canoe
being
studded
with
rocks
these
rapids
are
extremely
dangerous
as
the
cañon
widens
out
sufficiently
to
leave
a
narrow
beach
at
this
point
we
preferred
portaging
our
canvas
boat
to
impaling
her
on
one
of
the
rocks
it
was
a
strange
thing
that
our
sudden
appearance
should
have
so
startled
two
moose
who
were
standing
on
the
shore
that
instead
of
retreating
up
the
hill
they
plunged
boldly
into
the
river
of
whose
pitiless
power
they
evidently
knew
nothing
and
were
borne
helplessly
away
to
destruction
a
little
later
we
saw
their
bodies
stranded
on
a
shoal
and
the
sight
gave
me
a
chill
as
i
thought
that
that
perhaps
would
be
our
fate
too
before
we
escaped
from
the
long
cañon
we
had
hard
work
getting
the
boat
and
ourselves
over
the
broken
beach
beside
the
rapids
of
the
drowned
and
the
boat
had
more
than
one
as
we
slipped
and
stumbled
about
no
doubt
machard
would
have
been
glad
to
see
it
perforated
with
a
hole
beyond
repair
but
by
dint
of
great
care
and
hard
work
we
did
manage
to
bring
it
through
uninjured
and
then
we
halted
for
a
rest
and
a
bit
of
dinner
when
it
came
to
starting
again
machard
vowed
he
would
not
get
aboard
he
pleaded
to
be
allowed
to
follow
us
on
foot
but
i
would
not
listen
to
him
i
needed
him
for
ballast
in
the
first
place
and
moreover
if
we
did
get
through
alive
i
could
not
afford
to
waste
half
a
day
waiting
for
him
to
overtake
us
drawing
my
revolver
i
ordered
him
to
get
on
board
he
obeyed
trembling
and
we
started
again
dennazee
as
imperturbable
as
ever
illustration
shooting
a
fall
we
had
the
worst
part
of
the
passage
still
before
us
the
sides
of
the
cañon
drew
close
together
until
they
became
lofty
walls
between
which
the
river
shot
downward
like
a
the
great
black
cliffs
to
right
and
left
frowned
upon
us
as
if
indignantly
and
at
every
turn
in
the
cañon
a
whirlpool
yawned
ready
to
engulf
us
again
and
again
i
thought
we
were
caught
in
a
whirl
but
in
some
marvellous
manner
dennazee
extricated
us
and
we
darted
on
to
try
our
fate
with
another
extreme
as
our
peril
was
it
had
a
wonderful
thrill
and
excitement
about
it
and
in
the
midst
of
it
i
found
myself
thinking
that
were
i
only
in
a
big
york
boat
i
would
be
shouting
for
joy
instead
of
filled
with
apprehension
the
great
difficulty
was
to
keep
our
boat
straight
with
the
stream
for
as
i
have
already
told
you
she
was
so
pliant
that
she
bent
and
twisted
instead
of
keeping
stiff
and
more
than
once
i
felt
sure
she
would
cave
in
under
the
tremendous
pressure
upon
her
thin
sides
to
make
matters
worse
she
began
to
leak
again
and
although
i
commanded
machard
to
bail
her
out
with
a
pannikin
he
did
it
so
clumsily
in
his
terror
that
i
was
afraid
he
would
upset
us
and
had
to
order
him
to
stop
we
must
have
had
an
hour
or
more
of
this
when
for
the
first
time
dennazee
spoke
turning
round
just
for
a
moment
he
pointed
ahead
and
exclaimed
gate
i
knew
at
once
what
he
meant
we
had
almost
reached
the
end
of
the
cañon
there
remained
only
hell
gate
and
our
perils
would
be
over
hell
not
been
much
of
a
hand
at
praying
but
not
ashamed
to
confess
that
i
imitated
poor
example
then
as
for
him
the
moment
he
heard
what
dennazee
said
he
fell
on
his
knees
in
the
bottom
and
clinging
to
the
thwart
set
to
praying
with
all
his
might
and
main
with
a
thrilling
rush
we
swept
around
the
curve
and
plunged
into
hell
gate
it
is
an
awful
place
the
walls
of
the
cañon
are
two
hundred
feet
high
and
not
more
than
a
hundred
feet
apart
the
deep
water
spins
along
at
the
rate
of
twenty
miles
an
hour
while
at
the
end
is
a
sort
of
drop
into
a
black
dreadful
pool
where
the
whirls
are
the
worst
of
all
we
got
through
the
narrow
passage
all
right
and
then
with
a
dive
that
made
my
heart
stand
still
entered
the
whirlpools
there
were
three
of
them
and
we
struck
the
centre
one
in
spite
of
our
desperate
efforts
it
got
its
grip
full
upon
us
and
round
and
round
we
went
like
a
teetotum
it
is
not
at
all
likely
that
i
shall
ever
forget
that
experience
our
flimsy
craft
seemed
to
be
trying
to
collapse
every
moment
it
writhed
and
squirmed
like
a
living
thing
and
at
every
turn
of
the
awful
circle
we
drew
nearer
to
its
centre
which
yawned
to
engulf
us
i
had
given
up
all
hope
and
was
about
to
throw
away
my
paddle
and
prepare
for
the
last
struggle
when
suddenly
there
came
a
great
rush
of
water
down
the
cañon
the
whirlpools
all
filled
up
and
levelled
over
for
one
brief
minute
the
river
was
on
our
side
with
a
whoop
of
delight
dennazee
dug
his
paddle
deep
into
the
water
and
put
all
his
strength
upon
it
i
seconded
his
efforts
as
well
as
i
could
the
boat
hesitated
then
obeyed
and
moved
slowly
but
surely
forward
and
after
some
moments
of
harrowing
suspense
we
found
ourselves
floating
swiftly
but
safely
onward
with
no
more
dangers
ahead
cameron
ceased
speaking
and
picked
up
his
pipe
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
and
then
fleming
drawing
a
deep
breath
said
with
a
quizzical
smile
perhaps
you

the

after
centuries
of
seclusion
and
neglect
broken
only
by
the
infrequent
visits
of
ambitious
seekers
for
the
north
pole
or
mercenary
hunters
for
the
right
whale
and
by
the
ministrations
of
the
moravian
missionaries
the
eskimos
of
the
labrador
and
hudson
bay
region
suddenly
had
the
eyes
of
the
world
turned
inquiringly
upon
them
the
shocking
story
was
published
far
and
wide
that
a
winter
that
did
not
change
to
spring
in
the
usual
way
had
cut
off
their
supply
of
food
and
that
in
consequence
they
were
devouring
one
another
with
the
ghastly
relish
of
a
fiji
cannibal
although
this
report
proved
untrue
happily
the
eskimos
are
sufficiently
interesting
to
attract
attention
at
all
times
and
are
little
enough
known
to
furnish
an
adequate
excuse
at
this
time
for
a
brief
paper
upon
them
to
aid
me
in
presenting
the
earliest
glimpses
of
the
eskimos
i
am
fortunate
in
having
before
me
a
manuscript
prepared
by
the
late
robert
morrow
of
halifax
nova
scotia
an
accomplished
student
of
the
literatures
of
iceland
and
denmark
that
to
the
norsemen
and
not
to
the
spaniards
rightfully
belongs
the
credit
of
first
discovering
america
is
now
settled
and
that
when
the
norsemen
first
touched
american
soil
they
found
the
eskimos
already
in
possession
is
also
certain
yet
it
was
not
these
bold
adventurers
that
gave
these
curious
people
the
name
by
which
they
are
most
commonly
known
in
the
expressive
norse
tongue
they
were
described
as
skraelings
is
the
chips
parings
the
intention
was
not
of
course
to
convey
the
idea
that
they
were
cordially
accepted
as
chips
of
the
old
block
but
on
the
contrary
to
show
that
they
were
regarded
by
their
handsome
and
stalwart
discoverers
as
little
better
than
mere
fragments
of
view
which
however
unflattering
their
squat
stature
ugly
countenances
and
filthy
habits
went
far
to
justify
the
name
eskimo
was
given
to
them
by
the
abenaki
a
tribe
of
indians
in
southern
labrador
it
is
an
abbreviation
of
eskimautsik
which
means
eating
raw
fish
in
allusion
to
their
repulsive
custom
of
eating
both
fish
and
flesh
without
taking
the
preliminary
trouble
of
cooking
it
the
eskimos
themselves
assert
very
emphatically
that
they
are
innuit
is
the
people
as
though
they
were
the
only
people
in
the
world
and
by
the
way
it
is
worth
noticing
that
each
particular
tribe
of
these
huskies
thinks
itself
the
entire
population
of
the
globe
until
undeceived
by
the
advent
of
visitors
their
national
name
if
they
have
one
at
all
is
karalit
the
plural
of
karalik
meaning
those
that
stayed
behind
with
reference
to
this
latter
title
morrow
points
out
a
curious
fact
which
is
suggestive
strahlenburg
in
his
description
of
the
northern
part
of
asia
states
on
the
authority
of
the
tartar
writer
abulgazi
chan
that
og
or
ogus
chan
who
reigned
in
tartary
long
before
the
birth
of
christ
made
an
inroad
into
the
southern
asiatic
countries
and
as
some
of
his
tribes
stayed
behind
they
were
called
in
reproach
and
also
karalik
now
this
karalik
with
its
plural
karalit
is
the
very
name
that
the
eskimos
give
themselves
so
striking
a
resemblance
amounting
in
fact
to
identity
can
surely
be
accounted
for
in
no
other
way
and
for
this
suggestion
i
must
assume
all
responsibility
than
that
those
who
stayed
behind
in
tartary
subsequently
moved
over
to
the
american
continent
when
eric
the
red
sailed
across
from
iceland
to
greenland
somewhere
about
the
year
he
found
many
traces
of
the
eskimos
there
and
when
thorvald
some
twenty
years
later
ventured
as
far
south
as
vinland
identified
as
the
present
vineyard
with
which
he
was
so
delighted
that
he
exclaimed
here
is
a
beautiful
land
and
here
i
wish
to
raise
my
dwelling
the
unexpected
discovery
of
three
skin
boats
upon
the
beach
affected
him
and
his
followers
much
as
the
imprint
of
a
human
foot
did
robinson
crusoe
they
found
more
than
the
boats
however
for
each
boat
held
three
men
all
but
one
of
whom
they
caught
and
summarily
despatched
for
reasons
that
the
saga
discreetly
forbears
to
state
but
retribution
followed
fast
no
sooner
had
the
invaders
returned
to
their
ships
than
the
skraelings
attacked
them
in
great
force
and
although
the
norsemen
came
out
best
in
the
fighting
their
leader
thorvald
received
a
mortal
wound
he
charged
his
men
to
bury
him
upon
the
cape
at
which
he
had
thought
it
best
to
dwell
for
as
he
pathetically
added
it
may
happen
that
it
was
a
true
word
that
fell
from
my
mouth
that
i
should
dwell
here
for
a
time
his
men
did
as
they
were
bid
they
set
up
two
crosses
over
his
grave
whose
site
is
now
known
as
summit
point
they
then
hastened
homeward
after
the
lapse
of
two
years
one
thorfinn
karlsifori
fired
by
what
he
heard
in
iceland
of
the
wonderful
discoveries
made
by
the
hardy
sons
of
eric
the
red
fitted
out
an
imposing
expedition
his
boats
carrying
one
hundred
and
sixty
men
besides
women
cattle
and
set
sail
for
vinland
he
reached
his
destination
in
safety
and
remaining
there
for
some
time
improved
upon
his
method
of
treating
the
skraelings
instead
of
aimlessly
killing
them
he
cheerfully
cheated
them
getting
huge
packs
of
furs
in
exchange
for
bits
of
red
cloth
he
has
thus
described
his
chief
characteristics
these
men
were
black
and
and
had
straight
hair
on
their
heads
they
had
large
eyes
and
broad
cheeks
all
of
which
shows
that
although
the
eskimos
have
changed
their
habitat
since
then
they
have
not
altered
much
in
their
appearance
after
two
years
of
prosperous
trading
the
relations
between
the
norsemen
and
the
skraelings
became
strained
from
a
cause
too
amusing
not
to
be
related
as
already
stated
the
visitors
brought
a
few
of
their
cattle
with
them
and
it
happened
one
day
that
a
huge
bull
had
his
feelings
excited
some
way
or
other
perhaps
by
a
piece
of
red
cloth
thoughtlessly
paraded
in
his
view
at
all
events
he
bellowed
very
loud
and
charging
upon
the
terrified
eskimos
tossed
them
about
in
the
most
lively
fashion
they
incontinently
tumbled
into
their
boats
and
without
a
word
of
farewell
rowed
off
to
the
vast
amusement
of
the
owners
but
the
laughter
vanished
when
presently
the
runaways
returned
in
whole
ranks
like
a
rushing
stream
and
began
an
attack
in
which
the
norsemen
were
vanquished
by
sheer
force
of
numbers
and
deemed
it
prudent
to
make
off
without
standing
upon
the
order
of
their
going
with
the
departure
of
the
norsemen
the
curtain
of
obscurity
falls
upon
the
eskimos
and
is
not
lifted
again
until
we
find
them
not
luxuriating
amid
the
forests
of
vinland
but
scattered
far
and
wide
over
the
hideous
desolation
of
the
far
north
and
engaged
in
a
ceaseless
struggle
with
hunger
and
cold
just
when
they
thus
moved
northward
and
why
does
not
yet
appear
if
their
innate
and
intense
hatred
of
the
red
indian
be
of
any
service
as
a
clue
it
is
however
within
the
bounds
of
reason
to
believe
that
they
were
driven
from
their
comfortable
quarters
by
their
more
active
and
warlike
and
given
no
rest
until
they
found
it
amidst
the
icebergs
and
glaciers
of
labrador
and
hudson
bay
where
they
may
now
be
met
with
in
bands
numbering
from
a
dozen
to
a
hundred
or
more
throughout
the
whole
of
this
arctic
region
they
fearlessly
range
in
search
of
food
the
eskimos
are
in
fact
the
only
inhabitants
of
a
vast
territory
which
includes
the
shores
of
arctic
america
the
whole
of
greenland
and
a
tract
about
four
hundred
miles
long
on
the
asiatic
coast
beyond
behring
strait
thus
extending
over
a
distance
of
five
thousand
miles
from
east
to
west
and
three
thousand
two
hundred
miles
from
north
to
south
notwithstanding
this
wide
distribution
there
is
a
remarkable
uniformity
not
only
in
the
physical
features
of
the
eskimos
but
also
in
their
manners
traditions
and
language
consequently
very
much
that
may
be
said
of
the
canadian
children
of
the
cold
that
is
the
eskimos
of
labrador
and
hudson
bay
would
be
equally
true
of
the
other
branches
of
the
race
for
a
great
deal
of
interesting
information
concerning
them
we
are
indebted
to
the
writings
of
such
men
as
ribbach
and
herzeburg
moravian
missionaries
who
with
a
heroic
zeal
that
only
those
familiar
with
their
lot
can
adequately
appreciate
have
devoted
themselves
to
the
cure
of
souls
among
the
eskimos
there
are
six
of
these
moravian
missions
scattered
along
the
eastern
coast
of
labrador
nain
the
chief
one
was
established
as
far
back
as
okkak
in
hopedale
in
and
hebron
zoar
and
ramah
more
recently
the
bestowal
of
so
attractive
biblical
names
helps
very
little
however
to
mitigate
the
unfavourable
impression
produced
by
the
forbidding
surroundings
of
these
tiny
oases
almost
lost
in
a
seemingly
illimitable
desert
sheer
from
the
sea
except
where
broken
by
frequent
gulf
and
fiord
the
coast
line
towers
up
in
tremendous
and
unpitying
sternness
and
at
its
base
the
breakers
thunder
with
a
force
and
fury
that
knows
little
pause
throughout
the
year
from
end
to
end
the
shore
is
jagged
like
a
gigantic
saw
with
innumerable
bays
and
inlets
sprinkled
thick
with
islands
and
underlaid
with
hidden
reefs
which
makes
these
waters
difficult
to
find
and
dangerous
to
navigate
the
interior
of
the
country
is
equally
repellent
although
toward
the
west
it
becomes
less
mountainous
and
slightly
undulating
like
the
american
prairie
it
presents
nothing
but
an
inhospitable
and
savage
wilderness
covered
with
immense
forests
broken
by
numerous
swamps
and
lakes
and
untouched
by
human
foot
save
when
now
and
then
a
band
of
red
indians
venture
thither
lured
by
the
hope
of
food
and
fur
the
eskimos
upon
the
eastern
coast
of
labrador
are
as
a
rule
small
of
stature
not
much
exceeding
five
feet
those
upon
the
western
shore
however
are
taller
and
more
robust
they
are
quite
strongly
built
with
hair
and
beard
sweeping
down
over
the
shoulders
and
chest
when
the
good
seed
sown
by
the
patient
missionary
finds
lodging
in
a
heart
he
usually
signalizes
his
adoption
of
christianity
by
indulging
in
a
clean
shave
or
at
least
by
cutting
his
beard
short
with
a
pair
of
scissors
in
deference
perhaps
to
the
judgment
of
paul
that
if
a
man
have
long
hair
it
is
a
shame
unto
him
they
have
small
soft
hands
broad
shoulders
big
flat
faces
large
round
heads
and
short
stubby
noses
like
the
petals
of
a
flower
and
very
generous
mouths
which
being
nearly
always
on
the
broad
grin
make
free
display
of
fine
rows
of
sharp
white
teeth
in
complexion
they
are
tawny
and
ruddy
and
the
face
is
of
a
much
darker
shade
than
the
body
at
when
the
burning
rays
are
reflected
from
glistening
banks
of
snow
they
become
almost
as
black
in
the
face
as
negroes
but
babes
may
be
seen
as
fair
as
any
english
child
their
eyes
are
small
and
almost
uniformly
black
and
peep
brightly
out
at
you
from
underneath
a
perfect
forest
of
brow
and
lash
their
hair
is
black
also
and
very
thick
and
coarse
their
ordinary
food
is
the
flesh
of
the
seal
with
its
attendant
blubber
and
the
fish
that
abound
along
the
shore
they
are
not
particular
whether
their
dinner
is
cooked
or
not
and
i
seriously
question
whether
a
professional
pugilist
in
the
height
of
his
training
could
swallow
his
as
rare
as
the
eskimos
will
their
seal
cutlets
they
are
also
very
partial
to
tallow
soap
fish
oil
and
such
things
which
they
look
upon
as
great
delicacies
a
big
tallow
candle
being
rather
more
of
a
treat
to
an
eskimo
youngster
than
a
stick
of
candy
to
a
civilized
small
boy
that
these
peculiar
and
decidedly
repulsive
tastes
are
after
all
bottomed
on
the
laws
of
nature
is
clearly
shown
by
the
fact
that
when
the
natives
around
a
mission
station
adopt
a
european
diet
and
they
soon
become
passionately
fond
of
bread
and
biscuits
they
inevitably
grow
weak
and
incapable
of
standing
the
intense
cold
when
joe
that
heroic
eskimo
who
supported
expedition
by
his
hunting
after
hall
himself
had
died
was
transplanted
to
america
and
thence
to
england
he
soon
languished
and
grew
consumptive
despite
every
effort
to
preserve
his
health
on
joining
captain
young
in
the
his
only
remark
uttered
with
a
depth
of
eager
confident
hope
that
was
very
touching
was
get
little
seal
meat
then
all
right
prediction
that
was
fulfilled
to
the
very
letter
when
he
regained
his
native
ice
as
soon
as
they
killed
their
first
seal
joe
was
given
free
rein
and
he
began
to
revive
at
once
his
hollow
cheeks
resumed
their
chubbiness
and
smeariness
too
no
doubt
his
languor
left
him
and
he
was
in
short
another
man
the
seal
is
in
fact
everything
to
the
eskimo
what
the
buffalo
was
to
the
american
indian
what
the
reindeer
is
to
the
european
laplander
all
that
and
still
more
is
the
seal
to
these
children
of
the
cold
upon
its
meat
and
blubber
they
feed
with
its
fur
they
are
clothed
by
its
oil
they
are
warmed
and
lighted
stretched
upon
appropriate
framework
its
skin
makes
them
boats
and
tents
while
unkindest
use
of
all
with
its
bladder
they
float
the
fatal
harpoon
that
wrought
its
own
undoing
to
sum
it
all
up
in
one
sentence
take
away
the
seal
and
the
eskimo
could
not
exist
for
a
month
there
is
not
much
room
for
imperious
sway
in
labrador
from
scalp
to
toe
is
the
invariable
rule
and
there
would
be
no
small
difficulty
in
distinguishing
between
the
sexes
if
the
women
did
not
indulge
in
a
certain
amount
of
ornamentation
upon
their
garments
and
further
indicate
their
femininity
by
appending
to
their
sacques
a
curious
tail
reaching
almost
to
the
ground
which
they
renew
whenever
it
becomes
so
dirty
as
to
shock
even
their
sluggish
sensibilities
still
another
distinguishing
mark
permissible
however
only
to
those
who
have
attained
the
dignity
of
motherhood
is
the
amook
a
capacious
hood
hung
between
the
shoulders
which
forms
the
safest
and
snuggest
of
all
carrying
places
for
babies
that
otherwise
would
be
in
arms
illustration
in
addition
to
the
records
of
the
moravian
missionaries
the
reports
of
the
arctic
explorers
and
the
stories
brought
back
by
whalers
concerning
the
eskimos
much
information
has
been
gained
of
late
through
the
measures
taken
by
the
canadian
government
to
determine
the
practicability
of
hudson
bay
as
a
commercial
highway
for
three
successive
years
expeditions
on
an
extensive
scale
have
been
despatched
to
that
region
and
observing
stations
have
been
maintained
throughout
the
year
at
different
points
along
the
coast
of
labrador
and
the
shores
of
that
great
inland
sea
which
has
not
inappropriately
been
termed
the
mediterranean
of
canada
as
one
result
of
these
expeditions
much
attention
has
been
drawn
to
the
natives
lieutenant
gordon
who
has
commanded
all
three
has
many
kind
words
for
them
he
finds
them
docile

and
willing
to
work
and
apparently
much
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
increased
intercourse
with
the
white
man
occasionally
one
is
met
that
has
been
sufficiently
enterprising
to
acquire
the
english
language
while
many
others
understand
well
enough
what
is
said
to
them
in
that
language
although
they
can
not
be
persuaded
to
speak
it
they
are
wildly
fond
of
any
article
of
civilized
clothing
and
the
at
one
settlement
exhibited
no
little
pride
in
the
possession
of
a
linen
collar
almost
worthy
to
be
placed
beside
one
of
although
he
displayed
it
to
the
utmost
advantage
he
did
not
like
the
fiji
chieftain
consider
all
other
clothing
superfluous
when
stores
were
being
landed
at
the
stations
the
eskimos
would
gather
about
and
offer
their
services
which
were
always
accepted
and
then
all
day
long
they
would
toil
cheerfully
side
by
side
with
their
white
brethren
requiring
no
other
remuneration
than
biscuits
when
so
much
has
been
written
by
arctic
explorers
about
the
incorrigible
kleptomania
of
the
natives
it
is
no
less
a
matter
for
surprise
than
for
gratification
that
lieutenant
gordon
can
bear
this
testimony
as
to
the
moral
status
of
the
eskimos
at
hudson
bay
one
word
may
be
said
in
regard
to
their
honesty
although
scraps
of
iron
and
wood
possess
a
value
to
them
which
we
can
hardly
appreciate
they
would
take
nothing
without
first
asking
leave
not
even
a
chip
or
broken
nail
was
taken
without
their
first
coming
to
ask
permission
of
the
officer
who
was
on
duty
no
doubt
the
fact
that
practical
prohibition
prevails
has
something
to
do
with
this
highly
commendable
showing
the
law
aided
and
abetted
by
the
vigilant
missionaries
shuts
out
everything
stronger
than
and
the
path
of
the
eskimo
is
free
from
the
most
seductive
and
destructive
of
all
temptations
except
when
some
unprincipled
whaler
offers
him
a
pull
out
of
his
flask
this
however
is
a
rare
occurrence
and
there
is
no
record
of
any
such
disturbance
ever
having
been
raised
as
would
in
more
highly
civilized
communities
call
for
the
interference
of
the
police
although
the
simplicity
of
their
life
and
their
freedom
from
many
modern
vices
conduce
to
longevity
these
advantages
are
more
than
counterbalanced
by
the
strain
put
upon
their
constitutions
by
the
severity
of
the
climate
and
the
incessant
struggle
for
food
consequently
they
soon
age
and
seldom
live
beyond
sixty
years
the
doctrine
that
cleanliness
is
next
to
godliness
finds
few
adherents
in
eskimo
land
the
rule
seems
to
be
to
eschew
washing
throughout
the
year
and
many
a
mighty
hunter
goes
through
life
innocent
of
a
bath
unless
indeed
he
should
happen
to
be
tumbled
out
of
his
kayak
by
some
irate
walrus
with
other
than
sanitary
designs
in
mind
tuttle
the
historian
of
the
first
hudson
bay
expedition
is
authority
for
the
statement
that
the
children
when
very
young
are
sometimes
cleaned
by
being
licked
with
their
tongue
before
being
put
into
the
bag
of
feathers
that
serves
them
as
bed
cradle
and
blanket
but
one
can
not
help
thinking
that
this
particular
version
of
a
lick
and
a
promise
is
rather
too
laborious
to
have
extensive
vogue
so
familiar
has
the
world
been
made
through
the
medium
of
arctic
exploration
literature
with
the
igloos
huts
kayaks
and
umiaks
boats
sledges
dogs
harpoons
and
other
possessions
of
these
people
which
are
precisely
the
same
wherever
they
may
be
found
that
reference
to
them
seems
unnecessary
especially
as
the
canadian
eskimos
offer
nothing
peculiar
but
before
concluding
a
few
words
must
be
added
as
to
the
intellectual
and
moral
characteristics
of
the
race
their
intelligence
is
considerable
in
some
instances
they
display
not
only
a
taste
but
a
talent
for
music
and
drawing
one
case
is
mentioned
where
a
mere
lad
drew
an
excellent
outline
of
the
coast
for
over
a
hundred
miles
indicating
its
many
irregularities
with
astonishing
accuracy
they
are
capital
mimics
and
are
apt
at
learning
the
songs
and
dances
of
their
white
visitors
but
they
are
poor
men
of
business
they
generally
leave
to
the
purchaser
the
fixing
of
the
price
of
anything
they
have
to
sell
it
is
said
that
in
their
private
lives
their
state
of
morality
is
low
although
they
avoid
indecency
calculated
to
give
public
offence
stealing
and
lying
were
unknown
among
them
until
these
black
arts
were
introduced
by
the
whites
as
products
of
civilization
and
unhappily
the
natives
are
proving
apt
pupils
they
are
also
somewhat
given
to
gambling
although
by
no
means
without
courage
they
seldom
quarrel
and
never
go
to
war
with
one
another
as
to
religion
the
eskimos
before
they
accepted
christianity
had
little
or
none
that
was
worthy
of
the
name
they
believe
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
but
liberally
extend
this
doctrine
to
the
lower
animals
also
which
they
endow
with
souls
they
hold
also
that
human
souls
can
pass
into
the
bodies
of
these
very
animals
with
respect
to
the
higher
powers
their
creed
is
that
the
world
is
ruled
by
supernatural
beings
whom
they
call
owners
and
as
almost
every
object
has
its
owner
this
would
seem
to
be
a
kind
of
pantheism
after
death
human
souls
go
either
up
or
down
but
in
curious
contrast
to
the
belief
of
all
other
races
the
good
in
their
opinion
go
to
the
nether
world
where
they
bask
in
a
land
not
of
milk
and
honey
but
of
inexhaustible
seal
meat
and
blubber
the
bad
on
the
other
hand
go
to
the
upper
world
where
they
suffer
what
a
fashionable
preacher
euphemized
as
eternal
uneasiness
not
from
excess
of
heat
but
from
frost
and
famine
there
they
are
permitted
to
lighten
their
misery
by
playing
ball
with
a
walrus
head
which
diversion
by
the
way
in
some
inexplicable
fashion
gives
rise
to
the
aurora
borealis
like
all
aborigines
they
have
their
own
legend
of
the
deluge
and
to
this
day
they
proudly
point
out
a
large
island
lying
between
okkak
and
hebron
rising
to
the
height
of
nearly
seven
thousand
feet
which
they
claim
was
the
only
spot
left
uncovered
by
the
flood
and
upon
which
a
select
party
of
their
antediluvian
ancestors
survived
the
otherwise
catastrophe
the
future
destiny
of
this
interesting
race
may
be
readily
forecast
in
common
with
the
red
indian
of
the
plains
the
swarthy
eskimo
may
adopt
with
reference
to
the
white
man
those
words
of
fathomless
pathos
uttered
by
john
the
baptist
in
reference
to
the
messiah
he
must
increase
but
i
must
decrease
it
is
merely
a
question
of
time
all
over
the
vast
region
he
inhabits
are
signs
showing
that
his
numbers
were
far
greater
once
than
they
are
at
present
the
insatiable
greed
of
his
white
brothers
is
rendering
his
existence
increasingly
difficult
the
seal
and
the
walrus
are
ever
being
driven
farther
north
and
that
means
a
sterner
and
shorter
struggle
for
life
as
the
indian
will
not
long
survive
the
buffalo
so
the
eskimo
will
not
long
survive
the
seal
there
are
perhaps
fifteen
thousand
of
them
now
scattered
far
and
wide
over
the
tremendous
spaces
between
labrador
and
alaska
each
year
their
numbers
are
growing
less
and
ere
long
the
last
remnant
of
the
race
will
have
vanished
and
the
great
lone
north
will
return
to
the
state
of
appalling
solitude
and
silence
that
only
the
canadian
children
of
the
cold
had
the
fortitude
to
alleviate
by
their
presence
to
face
with
an
indian
devil
there
were
three
of
us
and
we
were
all
untiring
explorers
of
the
forests
and
streams
within
reach
of
our
homes
in
quest
of
such
possessors
of
fur
fin
or
feather
as
our
guns
and
rods
could
overcome
plenty
of
luck
did
we
have
too
for
we
lived
in
a
part
of
nova
scotia
and
the
trout
and
partridges
and
rabbits
had
not
had
their
ranks
thinned
by
too
much
hunting
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
us
to
bring
back
as
the
result
of
an
whipping
of
the
brooks
two
or
three
dozen
speckled
trout
weighing
from
to
three
pounds
each
while
less
than
a
dozen
brace
of
plump
partridges
or
rabbits
was
looked
on
as
a
very
poor
bag
for
a
shooting
adventurous
and
enterprising
as
we
were
however
one
stream
of
which
we
had
knowledge
remained
undisturbed
by
our
lines
it
was
known
among
the
a
band
of
whom
roamed
about
the
neighbourhood
as
indian
devil
run
being
so
called
because
of
their
belief
that
the
dense
dark
forest
in
which
it
took
its
rise
was
the
fastness
of
a
family
of
panthers
of
which
they
stood
in
great
dread
nor
was
the
name
without
good
foundation
for
one
autumn
a
hunter
with
gun
and
trap
ventured
into
this
place
and
returned
with
the
body
of
a
panther
stating
that
he
believed
others
still
remained
indian
devil
run
began
somewhere
in
the
north
forest
ran
through
its
heavy
shadows
for
several
miles
and
then
appeared
to
add
its
contribution
to
the
digdequash
river
at
which
point
we
made
its
acquaintance
we
often
talked
about
following
it
up
into
the
depths
of
the
forest
but
the
indian
stories
made
us
pause
until
at
last
one
evening
in
september
jack
johnston
craving
some
fresh
excitement
dared
us
to
make
the
attempt
and
we
rashly
accepted
the
challenge
the
following
morning
we
set
off
letting
no
one
know
the
object
of
our
expedition
we
were
armed
in
this
fashion
charlie
peters
bore
an
ancient
dutch
musket
warranted
when
properly
loaded
to
kill
at
both
ends
johnston
had
a
keen
tomahawk
which
the
indians
had
taught
him
to
use
like
one
of
themselves
and
i
carried
an
dangerous
only
to
small
game
now
if
we
come
across
an
indian
devil
charlie
said
johnston
you
give
him
a
broadside
from
and
finish
him
with
my
tomahawk
and
where
do
i
come
in
i
asked
with
a
smile
you
oh
you
blaze
away
at
him
with
your
pepperpot
you
might
perhaps
put
his
eyes
out
you
know
jack
laughingly
responded
and
so
our
order
of
battle
was
settled
upon
we
crossed
the
digdequash
in
a
canoe
hid
our
craft
in
the
underbrush
and
in
high
feather
entered
upon
the
exploration
of
indian
devil
run
it
proved
to
be
a
succession
of
falls
and
rapids
overshadowed
by
huge
trees
for
several
miles
and
we
had
hard
work
making
our
way
up
its
course
but
we
toiled
steadily
on
and
just
before
were
rewarded
for
our
pains
by
reaching
a
lovely
spot
where
the
banks
of
the
stream
widened
to
form
an
enchanting
pond
encircled
by
a
meadow
and
offering
every
inducement
to
stay
and
rest
glad
were
we
to
do
so
the
pond
evidently
swarmed
with
trout
quickly
adjusting
our
we
got
to
work
shade
of
izaak
walton
what
a
paradise
for
anglers
the
water
fairly
boiled
as
the
hungry
trout
fought
for
the
privilege
of
being
hooked
in
one
hour
we
landed
as
many
as
we
could
carry
home
and
they
were
fine
fellows
every
one
of
them
the
greatest
place
for
trout
i
ever
struck
exclaimed
charlie
peters
throwing
down
his
rod
i
positively
the
heart
to
catch
any
more
it
seems
like
taking
a
mean
advantage
of
them
so
we
stopped
the
much
to
the
disappointment
of
our
prey
who
hung
about
asking
to
be
made
proceeded
to
dispose
of
the
ample
lunch
with
which
our
thoughtful
mothers
had
provided
us
then
we
had
a
refreshing
plunge
in
the
clear
water
scaring
the
trout
nearly
out
of
their
skins
and
by
this
time
it
was
necessary
that
we
should
retrace
our
steps
on
our
way
up
i
had
brought
down
a
fine
brace
of
birds
and
to
save
carrying
them
to
and
fro
had
hung
them
to
a
high
branch
intending
to
pick
them
up
on
the
return
journey
forget
your
partridges
hal
said
jack
to
me
as
we
shouldered
our
bags
heavy
with
trout
no
fear
of
that
i
replied
i
know
exactly
where
i
left
them
hitherto
we
had
seen
and
heard
nothing
to
justify
the
superstitious
dread
of
the
locality
no
signs
of
wild
animals
were
visible
and
in
high
spirits
at
having
discovered
so
rich
a
we
hastened
homeward
i
guess
the
indian
devils
have
got
tired
of
this
place
and
left
remarked
charlie
peters
but
let
us
give
it
away
all
the
same
we
must
keep
this
run
all
to
ourselves
as
long
as
we
can
hardly
had
he
spoken
when
an
appalling
shriek
pierced
the
silence
of
the
woods
and
brought
us
to
a
sudden
stop
while
we
looked
into
one
faces
with
an
apprehension
we
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
we
were
close
to
the
tree
where
the
partridges
had
been
hung
the
indian
devil
exclaimed
jack
johnston
under
his
breath
eaten
the
partridges
and
now
he
wants
to
eat
us
we
fully
realized
our
danger
and
after
the
first
shock
of
fright
braced
ourselves
to
meet
it
with
a
determined
front
johnston
as
the
eldest
and
coolest
of
the
three
took
command
charlie
said
he
you
must
let
him
have
dutchie
full
in
the
face
the
moment
we
sight
you
blaze
away
with
your
and
stand
by
to
finish
him
with
my
tomahawk
nodding
assent
to
these
directions
we
stood
side
by
side
gazing
eagerly
into
the
forest
gloom
there
he
is
said
johnston
see
on
that
big
limb
we
followed
the
direction
of
his
finger
and
saw
the
brute
clearly
enough
stretched
upon
a
limb
not
twelve
yards
away
his
great
green
eyes
glaring
horribly
at
us
quick
charlie
cried
jack
going
to
spring
rest
your
gun
on
my
shoulder
and
aim
for
his
chest
charlie
did
as
he
was
bid
and
pulled
the
trigger
bang
went
the
old
musket
with
a
tremendous
report
over
went
charlie
on
his
back
his
shoulder
dislocated
by
the
kick
of
his
weapon
and
down
came
the
panther
to
the
ground
badly
wounded
in
his
neck
and
breast
the
instant
he
touched
ground
i
let
him
have
the
contents
of
my
but
they
only
served
to
bother
him
for
a
moment
and
looking
terrible
in
his
fury
he
was
just
gathering
himself
for
a
spring
into
our
midst
when
johnston
stepping
forward
sent
his
tomahawk
whizzing
through
the
air
with
all
the
force
of
his
strong
right
arm
illustration
johnston
sent
his
tomahawk
whizzing
through
the
air
it
was
a
perfect
throw
no
could
have
done
it
better
like
a
flash
of
lightning
the
bright
steel
blade
went
straight
to
its
mark
and
buried
itself
in
the
forehead
right
between
those
awful
eyes
whose
malignant
gleam
it
extinguished
for
ever
lifting
charlie
to
his
feet
we
rushed
forward
and
stood
in
triumph
over
our
fallen
foe
shaking
hands
across
his
mighty
body
how
our
hearts
swelled
with
pride
at
the
thought
of
the
sensation
our
exploit
would
make
with
a
twisted
withe
for
a
rope
we
laboriously
dragged
our
prize
to
the
canoe
and
so
got
it
across
the
river
here
we
met
the
indian
who
had
been
teacher
in
the
art
of
he
seemed
immensely
relieved
at
seeing
us
me
see
you
boys
go
over
this
morning
then
hear
devil
scream
this
afternoon
and
hear
you
go
bang
me
you
all
deaded
this
time
then
as
he
discovered
the
fatal
gash
in
the
head
his
face
lit
up
with
pride
johnston
you
do
that
he
cried
ah
smart
boy
me
learn
you
how
throw
tomahawk
like
that
jack
blushingly
acknowledged
the
fact
and
gave
his
indian
instructor
due
meed
of
praise
for
having
taught
him
so
well
it
was
too
big
a
job
to
get
the
heavy
carcass
of
the
panther
any
further
so
the
indian
took
off
the
head
and
skin
for
us
and
we
presented
him
with
the
body
which
he
said
was
good
to
eat
and
would
make
indian
strong
our
arrival
at
home
with
the
trophies
of
our
triumph
over
the
terror
of
the
forest
caused
great
rejoicing
we
were
the
heroes
of
the
hour
and
charlie
quite
forgot
his
bruised
shoulder
in
the
pleasant
excitement
of
the
occasion
we
often
revisited
indian
devil
run
after
that
and
took
many
a
fine
fare
of
fish
from
its
waters
but
we
never
saw
another
panther
we
had
apparently
killed
the
last
of
the
brood
the
nick
of
time
will
you
be
out
to
practice
this
evening
charlie
asked
rob
of
his
friend
kent
as
the
two
who
had
been
walking
home
from
the
high
school
together
parted
at
a
corner
indeed
that
i
will
was
the
reply
and
every
evening
too
until
the
match
comes
off
take
all
the
practice
we
can
put
in
to
beat
those
riverside
chaps
i
can
tell
you
pshaw
what
makes
you
think
be
so
hard
to
beat
this
time
returned
rob
always
had
our
fair
share
of
the
games
so
far
so
we
have
but
they
have
sam
massie
playing
with
them
sam
massie
sam
massie
exclaimed
rob
in
surprise
you
know
who
sam
massie
is
why
one
of
the
first
twelve
of
the
torontos
replied
charlie
looking
somewhat
astonished
at
his
ignorance
then
how
on
earth
can
he
play
with
the
riversides
asked
rob
we
protest
oh
all
right
enough
his
uncle
lives
in
riverside
and
he
is
staying
with
him
for
a
while
so
we
object
to
his
playing
humph
growled
rob
a
pity
we
got
nobody
to
match
him
i
think
a
pity
at
all
returned
charlie
cheerfully
a
good
deal
rather
see
a
crack
player
like
sam
massie
and
get
some
points
from
him
than
object
to
his
playing
even
if
he
gains
the
match
for
the
other
fellows
do
our
best
to
give
him
a
good
work
any
way
so
practise
hard
and
charlie
went
off
whistling
there
was
an
intense
rivalry
between
the
villages
of
riverside
and
heatherton
in
the
matter
of
lacrosse
each
village
had
a
good
club
in
which
not
only
the
players
but
the
people
also
took
a
hearty
interest
and
the
matches
that
were
played
once
a
month
alternately
in
each
village
during
the
season
never
failed
to
draw
out
to
see
them
everybody
in
the
population
that
could
possibly
manage
to
be
present
they
were
always
played
on
saturday
because
then
the
farmers
from
round
about
came
in
to
the
village
to
do
their
business
early
in
the
morning
and
by
rushing
things
a
little
could
easily
get
through
by
three
and
then
they
and
the
shopkeepers
and
the
rest
of
the
village
folk
would
adjourn
to
the
and
have
a
lively
time
of
it
shouting
and
cheering
and
laughing
as
the
game
went
on
before
them
charlie
kent
and
rob
were
the
two
youngest
members
of
the
heatherton
lacrosse
twelve
and
they
naturally
felt
very
proud
of
their
position
which
they
had
won
by
proving
themselves
the
best
players
in
the
high
school
and
thereby
attracting
the
attention
of
the
heatherton
captain
quite
early
in
the
season
the
day
when
big
tom
brown
called
them
both
aside
and
invited
them
to
play
with
the
first
twelve
was
one
of
the
proudest
in
their
lives
and
tom
had
had
no
reason
to
regret
his
invitation
on
any
game
that
summer
for
the
two
young
cubs
as
he
called
them
proved
themselves
very
useful
additions
being
quick
careful
plucky
and
best
of
all
thoroughly
obedient
always
doing
exactly
what
he
told
them
the
next
match
with
riverside
was
of
special
importance
because
it
would
be
the
final
and
decisive
one
of
five
which
the
two
clubs
were
playing
for
a
fine
set
of
silk
flags
which
had
been
offered
as
a
trophy
by
some
generous
friends
of
lacrosse
in
both
villages
each
club
had
won
two
matches
and
now
on
the
approaching
saturday
the
fifth
and
final
match
would
take
place
rain
or
shine
the
rumour
of
sam
massie
being
with
the
riversides
had
reached
heatherton
early
in
the
week
and
caused
no
little
concern
some
of
the
players
being
disposed
to
make
a
protest
if
he
appeared
on
the
field
and
even
a
refusal
to
play
but
tom
brown
would
not
listen
to
them
sam
massie
was
for
the
time
being
at
least
a
resident
in
riverside
and
to
object
to
his
playing
would
be
acting
in
a
way
he
did
not
approve
of
so
the
dissatisfied
ones
were
fain
to
hold
their
tongues
the
eventful
saturday
came
and
was
as
fine
as
heart
could
wish
it
was
turn
to
have
the
match
and
the
home
team
rejoiced
at
this
because
it
would
in
some
measure
compensate
them
for
the
advantage
their
opponents
undoubtedly
possessed
in
having
sam
massie
with
them
never
before
had
so
large
a
crowd
assembled
to
watch
the
match
it
really
seemed
as
if
half
the
population
of
riverside
and
of
the
population
of
heatherton
had
turned
out
the
whole
field
was
surrounded
with
a
fringe
of
spectators
ready
to
applaud
every
good
point
in
the
game
in
due
time
the
riverside
team
made
their
appearance
looking
very
jaunty
in
their
blue
jerseys
caps
and
stockings
and
white
knickerbockers
and
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
them
to
discover
the
redoubtable
sam
massie
it
was
easy
to
distinguish
him
from
the
others
and
he
certainly
was
a
player
he
was
not
of
more
than
medium
size
but
the
perfection
of
his
condition
the
graceful
ease
and
quickness
of
his
movements
and
the
unfailing
accuracy
of
his
catching
and
throwing
as
the
team
indulged
in
the
usual
preliminary
exercise
impressed
everybody
with
the
idea
that
he
fully
merited
his
reputation
charlie
place
was
his
quickness
and
steadiness
entitling
him
to
that
important
position
while
rob
was
the
next
man
between
him
and
the
goal
charlie
was
very
anxious
to
see
where
the
riversides
would
put
massie
and
was
not
at
all
sorry
when
that
player
took
his
place
at
for
now
he
would
be
certain
to
cross
sticks
with
him
more
than
once
during
the
match
and
find
out
just
how
strong
a
man
he
was
amid
the
breathless
suspense
of
the
spectators
the
two
teams
lined
up
were
briefly
adjured
by
the
referee
to
indulge
in
no
rough
play
or
fouls
and
then
in
pairs
departed
to
their
places
the
white
and
blue
of
the
riversides
contrasting
picturesquely
with
the
white
and
crimson
of
the
heathertons
as
the
players
strung
out
from
goal
to
goal
are
you
all
ready
cried
the
referee
the
captains
nodded
their
heads
the
two
kneeled
opposite
one
another
for
the
face
the
ball
was
placed
between
the
lacrosse
sticks
and
with
a
shout
of
play
the
referee
sprang
aside
and
the
struggle
began
there
was
a
scuffle
between
the
two
centres
and
then
the
heathertons
raised
a
shout
for
charlie
had
got
the
ball
away
from
his
opponent
tipped
it
cleverly
to
rob
who
after
a
short
run
had
thrown
it
to
outside
home
and
the
riverside
goal
was
in
danger
but
before
outside
home
could
do
anything
massie
was
down
upon
him
with
the
swoop
of
an
eagle
with
a
sharp
check
he
knocked
the
ball
off
his
stick
then
picked
it
up
at
once
and
dashed
away
down
the
field
dodging
in
and
out
between
his
two
opponents
like
a
veritable
eel
not
until
he
reached
the
heatherton
was
he
obliged
to
stop
and
then
he
took
a
shot
at
goal
which
but
for
the
plucky
goalkeeper
putting
his
broad
chest
squarely
in
the
way
would
certainly
have
scored
back
the
ball
went
however
to
the
other
goal
and
continued
thus
to
travel
up
and
down
for
fully
fifteen
minutes
before
some
skilful
passing
and
sharp
dodging
on
the
part
of
the
heathertons
brought
it
in
front
of
the
riverside
goal
when
after
a
hard
tussle
it
was
swiped
through
by
a
lucky
stroke
from
charlie
kent
great
was
the
elation
of
the
heathertons
at
scoring
the
first
game
guess
not
invincible
after
all
if
they
have
sam
massie
said
charlie
to
captain
brown
crow
too
soon
charlie
replied
brown
cautiously
got
the
afternoon
before
us
yet
when
the
riversides
thanks
to
a
brilliant
run
of
won
the
next
game
in
five
minutes
charlie
felt
somewhat
less
confident
and
when
after
a
severe
struggle
they
by
a
pure
piece
of
luck
took
the
third
game
in
twenty
minutes
he
began
to
feel
a
little
down
in
the
mouth
but
the
winning
of
the
fourth
game
by
the
heathertons
braced
him
up
again
and
he
went
into
the
fifth
and
final
struggle
with
a
brave
and
determined
heart
the
excitement
had
now
become
intense
it
had
been
agreed
before
play
commenced
that
the
game
should
be
called
at
six
and
if
not
then
finished
played
over
again
at
riverside
the
following
saturday
the
heathertons
fully
appreciated
the
advantage
of
playing
oh
their
own
ground
and
were
determined
to
settle
the
fate
of
the
flags
before
six
if
at
all
possible
the
riversides
were
equally
determined
to
play
out
the
time
if
they
could
do
nothing
better
accordingly
they
concentrated
all
their
strength
upon
the
defence
and
surrounded
the
redoubtable
sam
massie
with
the
best
men
in
the
team
once
more
charlie
kent
won
the
face
and
again
tipped
to
rob
who
did
not
fail
to
send
it
well
down
towards
the
goal
but
the
defence
quickly
sent
it
back
again
and
again
the
rubber
sphere
went
flying
through
the
air
or
bounding
along
the
ground
towards
the
riverside
goal
and
again
and
again
it
returned
not
even
being
permitted
to
stay
there
a
moment
the
minutes
passed
quickly
and
six
drew
near
charlie
you
and
rob
manage
to
get
that
ball
down
between
you
never
mind
your
places
just
play
for
the
goal
said
captain
brown
earnestly
to
charlie
all
right
captain
do
our
best
replied
charlie
as
he
passed
the
word
to
rob
as
luck
would
have
it
the
riversides
grown
bold
by
their
success
opened
out
their
defence
just
then
and
moved
nearer
the
heatherton
goal
quick
eye
noted
the
change
of
tactics
instantly
look
sharp
now
rob
he
called
and
rob
nodded
meaningly
a
moment
later
the
ball
came
flying
his
way
and
springing
high
he
caught
it
cleverly
amid
a
howl
of
applause
from
the
spectators
then
signalling
rob
to
keep
parallel
with
him
he
dashed
off
at
full
speed
towards
the
riverside
goal
charlie
was
lightly
built
and
and
constant
practice
had
made
him
the
fastest
sprinter
in
heatherton
but
he
had
never
run
before
as
he
had
then
the
onlookers
held
their
breath
to
watch
him
as
he
sped
on
one
two
three
opponents
were
safely
passed
by
brilliant
dodging
and
now
only
sam
massie
stood
between
him
and
the
goal
he
knew
it
would
be
useless
to
try
to
dodge
sam
but
there
was
a
better
play
before
sam
could
reach
him
he
tipped
the
rubber
over
to
rob
instantly
sam
turned
upon
rob
and
brought
his
stick
down
upon
with
a
resounding
whack
but
the
ball
was
not
there
already
it
was
rolling
towards
charlie
who
had
continued
straight
on
and
scooping
it
up
from
the
ground
with
a
straight
swift
overhand
throw
he
sent
it
flying
through
the
just
in
time
to
allow
the
cry
of
goal
goal
to
be
triumphantly
raised
ere
the
whistle
sounded
the
hour
for
calling
the
game
charlie
kent
was
of
course
the
hero
of
the
day
sam
massie
brilliantly
as
he
had
played
was
quite
forgotten
but
he
did
not
forget
to
come
up
and
clap
charlie
warmly
on
the
back
saying
bravo
my
boy
make
a
championship
player
some
day
you
must
come
up
to
toronto
we
want
your
kind
up
there
three
things
have
the
red
children
of
the
forest
given
to
the
white
children
of
the
cities
which
are
so
perfect
in
their
way
that
it
is
hardly
possible
there
will
ever
be
an
invention
filed
in
the
of
the
that
will
surpass
them
the
canoe
for
shallow
water
and
what
might
be
called
navigation
the
toboggan
and
the
for
deep
snow
seem
to
be
the
very
crown
of
human
ingenuity
even
though
they
are
only
the
devices
of
ignorant
indians
one
can
not
help
a
feeling
of
hearty
admiration
when
looking
at
them
and
noting
how
perfectly
they
fulfil
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
designed
and
are
at
the
same
time
as
light
graceful
and
artistic
in
form
and
fashion
as
the
most
finished
work
of
folk
they
all
follow
the
line
cf
beauty
so
closely
that
it
is
no
wonder
the
ladies
love
to
decorate
their
and
boudoirs
with
them
or
to
have
their
pins
and
brooches
modelled
after
them
illustration
to
the
indian
the
canoe
and
toboggan
were
quite
as
important
implements
as
the
spade
the
plough
and
the
rake
are
to
the
farmer
without
them
he
could
not
in
have
roamed
the
forests
whose
recesses
supplied
his
table
or
voyaged
in
the
upon
the
broad
rivers
and
streams
whose
bountiful
waters
furnished
him
their
ready
toll
of
fish
his
white
brother
has
in
adopting
them
put
them
to
a
different
use
he
had
no
particular
need
for
them
in
his
work
but
he
was
quick
to
see
how
they
would
help
him
in
his
play
and
erelong
they
had
all
three
become
favourite
means
of
sport
and
recreation
disputes
with
tobogganing
the
honour
of
being
national
winter
sport
for
although
have
been
seen
in
siberia
and
tartary
and
are
used
to
some
extent
in
scandinavia
in
none
of
these
places
do
the
people
derive
much
amusement
from
them
simple
as
the
seems
i
would
not
advise
any
one
to
try
to
make
a
pair
for
himself
only
the
indians
can
do
this
really
well
and
even
in
canada
the
vast
majority
of
shoes
are
put
together
by
dusky
hands
this
is
how
they
make
a
shoe
of
three
feet
six
inches
which
is
a
fair
average
size
piece
of
light
ash
about
thick
and
at
least
ninety
inches
in
length
is
bent
to
a
long
oval
until
the
two
ends
touch
when
they
are
lashed
strongly
together
with
catgut
two
strips
of
tough
wood
about
an
inch
broad
are
then
fitted
across
this
frame
one
being
placed
about
five
inches
from
the
curving
top
the
other
some
twenty
inches
from
the
tapering
end
the
object
of
these
strips
is
to
give
both
strength
and
spring
to
the
shoe
the
three
sections
into
which
the
interior
of
the
frame
has
thus
been
divided
are
then
woven
across
with
catgut
each
having
a
different
degree
of
fineness
in
the
mesh
the
top
section
being
very
fine
the
middle
section
upon
which
almost
the
whole
strain
comes
coarse
and
strong
and
the
end
section
a
medium
grade
between
the
other
two
the
gut
in
the
middle
section
is
wound
right
around
the
framework
for
the
sake
of
greater
strength
but
in
the
other
two
is
threaded
through
holes
bored
at
intervals
of
an
inch
or
so
just
behind
the
front
an
opening
about
four
inches
square
is
left
in
the
gut
netting
in
order
to
allow
free
play
for
the
toes
in
lifting
the
shoe
at
each
step
both
wood
and
gut
must
be
thoroughly
seasoned
or
else
the
one
will
warp
and
the
other
stretch
and
sag
until
the
shoe
is
altogether
useless
the
shoes
are
made
in
many
shapes
and
of
many
sizes
ranging
from
two
to
six
feet
in
length
and
from
ten
to
twenty
inches
in
breadth
but
for
all
practical
purposes
a
shoe
measuring
three
feet
six
inches
by
twelve
or
fifteen
inches
is
the
best
in
racing
narrower
shoes
are
used
but
they
rarely
go
below
ten
inches
that
being
the
regulation
measurement
for
club
competitions
then
again
some
are
turned
up
in
front
like
tiny
toboggans
instead
of
being
flat
this
kind
being
worn
principally
by
ladies
and
now
supposing
that
we
have
a
pair
of
shoes
entirely
to
our
satisfaction
let
us
constitute
ourselves
members
of
a
club
and
take
a
tramp
with
it
is
immensely
popular
in
montreal
as
all
visitors
to
the
winter
carnival
well
know
there
are
twenty
or
more
organized
clubs
there
the
membership
in
most
cases
being
rigidly
confined
to
the
masculine
gender
and
every
fine
night
in
the
week
all
winter
long
some
club
or
other
has
a
meet
discipline
is
pretty
strictly
enforced
at
these
club
tramps
and
seeing
how
earnestly
the
members
go
about
the
business
an
onlooker
might
well
be
pardoned
for
thinking
that
there
was
quite
as
much
work
as
play
in
this
particular
amusement
the
pace
set
and
the
distance
travelled
are
both
beyond
the
powers
of
beginners
so
that
unless
one
is
willing
to
stand
a
good
deal
of
merciless
chaffing
and
have
a
pretty
hard
time
of
it
altogether
it
is
better
to
wait

let
us
imagine
then
that
it
is
one
of
those
glorious
nights
in
midwinter
when
this
dull
old
earth
of
ours
seems
transformed
into
the
snow
lies
in
white
depths
upon
the
ground
dry
and
firm
as
ocean
sand
jack
frost
has
brought
the
mercury
away
down
some
points
below
zero
and
the
keen
air
sets
every
nerve
a
superb
moon
swings
high
in
the
heavens
flooding
the
wintry
world
with
her
silver
splendour
and
a
hundred
active
muscular
young
fellows
have
gathered
at
the
rendezvous
clothed
in
white

coats
with
rainbow
borders
brilliant
blue
sashes
and

hands
are
down
upon

you
all
ready

the
captain

hearty
chorus
of

out
on

keen
air

he

they
set
forth
to
attack
the
mountain
which
towers
up
so
grandly
behind
the
city
forming
one
of
the
finest
parks
in
the
world
the
line
of
march
is
made
up
very
simply
the
captain
who
is
selected
for
that
position

his
renown

really
arduous
duties
are
to
quicken
up
the
laggards

the
unfortunate

inspire
the
despondent

upon
him
it
depends
to
have
the
club
all
in
together
at
the
end
of

tramp
wending
along
the
paths

diving
deep
into
the
forest
where
there
are
no

at
all
the
long
thin
line
climbs
steadily
upward
growing
longer
as
the
steep
ascent
begins
to
tell
upon
the
weaker
ones
and
they
lag
behind
at
length
the
summit
is
reached
and
a
halt
is
called
for
a
few
minutes
that
the
panting
perspiring
climbers
may
get
their
breath
and
close
up
the
gaps
in
their
ranks

the
close

up

up
is
the
cheery
response

forward
and
off
they
go
again

time
down
instead
of
up
with
head
thrown
back
shoulders

firmly
muscles
at
high
tension
and
eyes
alert

and
faster
grows
the
pace
as
the
impetus
of
the
decline
is
more
and
more
felt
the
shoes
rattle
like
castanets
and
the
long
line
of
figures
undulates
in
and
out
among
the
tree
clumps
appearing
vanishing
and
reappearing
like
some
monstrous
serpent
in
full
chase
after
its
prey
ha
that
a
fence
right
across
the
path
what
is
to
be
done
now
the
leader
soon
answers
this
question
for
over
the
obstacle
he
goes
as
lightly
as
a
bird
and
his
followers
imitate
him
as
best
they
may
some

content
to
crawl
gingerly
across

of
hands
and
knees

luckless
wight
tripping
on

top
takes
a
sudden
header
into
the
on
the
other
side
leaving
only
a
pair
of
legs
in
sight
to
mark
the
place
of
his
downfall
but
the
comes
to
the
rescue
and
soon
has
him
on
his
shoes
again
what
between
fences
hedges
ditches
and
other
difficulties
the
line
is
far
from
being
well
kept
up
gaps
are
frequent
and
wide
some
have
fallen
and
lost
time
in
getting
upright
others
have
been
outstripped
but
the
leaders
like
time
and
tide
wait
for
no
man
and
soon
the
welcome
lights
of
the
nestling
in
the
valley
flash
cheeringly
across
the
snow
then
the
captain
pauses
a
few
minutes
that
those
who
have
been
distanced
may
regain
their
places
and
all
being
once
more
together
a
final
spurt
at
racing
speed
brings
them
with
shouts
of
joy
and
sighs
of
relief
to
their
goal

are
slipped
off

and

thrown
gleefully
aside
and
parched

cooled
with
refreshing
drinks

hour
or
more
is
spent
in
rest
and
frolic
and
then
the
return
journey
made
by
the
road
with
the
shoes
strapped
upon
the
back
the
distance
across
the
mountain
is
nearly
three
miles
yet
it
has
been
done
by
an
amateur
in
sixteen

nature
of
the

is
remarkably
good
going
the
best
amateur
time
for
a
hundred
yards

is
twelve
and
a
half
seconds
so
that
clumsy
and
cumbersome
as
the
raquets
may
seem
at

glance
they
are
really
a
very
slight
bar
to
speed

the
wearer
is
thoroughly
expert

their
use

and
hounds
on
is
a
sport
that
must
commend
itself

all

vigorous
boys

many
other
sports

very
easy

you
have
mastered
the
art
of
sliding
one
shoe
over
the
other
with
very
much
the
same
motion
that
you
would
make
in
skating
instead
of
lifting
it
up
high

you
were

frank

a
second
cried
jack
stone
breathlessly
as
he
ran
after
his
friend
frank
halted
until
jack
caught
up
to
him
well
jack
your
news
you
seem
to
be
excited
about
something
said
he
so
i
am
panted
jack
for
big
news
to
tell
you
uncle
william
has
offered
a
sovereign
to
the
fellow
that
makes
the
best
time
swimming
across
the
arm
what
do
you
think
of
that
why
i
think
just
splendid
of
him
and
going
to
try
for
one
and
i
too
you
may
be
sure
and
george
murray
and
hal
hemming
say
going
in
i
was
telling
them
about
it
this
morning
of
course
we
all
win
but
the
more
the
merrier
you
know
and
i
think
you
and
i
will
stand
as
good
a
chance
as
any
of
them
just
about
as
good
assented
frank
that
is
if
none
of
the
big
boys
are
allowed
to
try
did
your
uncle
make
any
rule
about
that
of
course
he
did
replied
jack
nobody
over
fifteen
can
compete
oh
all
right
and
only
fair
too
said
frank
evidently
much
relieved
we
go
out
and
have
a
practice
this
afternoon
suggested
jack
so
hot
that
the
water
ought
to
be
as
warm
as
milk
all
right
said
frank
just
wait
till
i
leave
this
parcel
at
the
house
and
get
a
couple
of
towels
and
then
with
you
accordingly
a
few
minutes
later
the
two
boys
with
towels
in
hand
were
trudging
toward
the
arm
impatient
to
be
in
the
water
for
the
sun
was
sending
down
lots
of
heat
that
summer
afternoon
frank
brookfield
and
jack
stone
were
very
great
friends
had
been
so
indeed
almost
from
their
nursery
days
they
got
along
about
as
well
together
as
two
boys
who
had
each
his
own
share
of
spirit
and
selfishness
could
and
although
they
were
rivals
in
a
good
many
of
their
boyish
sports
they
had
a
wise
way
of
looking
at
the
matter
for
next
to
coming
out
first
himself
each
was
eager
that
the
other
should
and
consequently
they
had
no
occasion
to
quarrel
over
the
result
in
the
science
of
swimming
they
were
very
evenly
matched
what
jack
lacked
in
strength
as
compared
with
frank
who
stood
an
inch
taller
being
about
made
up
by
a
superiority
in
style
that
was
natural
to
him
in
everything
he
did
hot
as
the
afternoon
was
they
were
too
eager
for
their
dip
to
walk
slowly
and
when
they
reached
the
projecting
rock
from
which
they
were
accustomed
to
rock
it
was
called
being
a
mass
of
dark
rusty
were
both
very
warm
and
in
a
high
state
of
perspiration
this
however
would
not
have
mattered
much
if
they
had
undressed
immediately
and
plunged
right
in
but
instead
of
doing
so
they
laid
aside
their
outer
clothes
and
then
sat
down
to
cool
off
thus
allowing
a
reaction
to
set
in
that
came
near
having
serious
consequences
when
they
thought
they
had
cooled
sufficiently
they
finished
their
undressing
and
were
ready
for
the
water
half
a
mind
to
swim
clear
across
said
frank
as
they
stood
out
on
the
end
of
the
rock
hesitating
for
a
moment
as
all
swimmers
do
before
diving
into
the
cool
green
depths
better
not
said
jack
who
was
the
more
cautious
of
the
two
you
might
be
too
tired
to
swim
back
well
then
tell
you
what
do
swim
out
to
the
middle
and
back
again
and
be
just
the
distance
for
the
race
all
right
here
goes
assented
jack
and
with
a
plump
plump
the
two
boys
like
two
gigantic
went
head
first
into
the
water
coming
up
again
three
or
four
yards
away
with
dripping
heads
and
blinking
eyes
and
striking
out
vigorously
toward
the
centre
of
the
arm
ah
but
cold
exclaimed
frank
half
gasping
you
bet
concurred
jack
very
cold
as
ice
what
business
has
the
water
to
be
so
cold
on
such
a
broiling
day
as
this
oh
just
a
little
way
it
has
said
frank
but
cold
or
not
cold
going
out
to
the
middle
and
with
a
powerful
overhand
stroke
he
ploughed
his
way
through
the
rippled
brine
his
shoulders
gleaming
white
as
he
bent
to
his
work
jack
using
the
ordinary
breast
stroke
kept
close
up
to
him
and
they
worked
too
hard
to
do
much
talking
until
the
centre
of
the
arm
was
reached
and
they
could
see
the
whole
beautiful
sheet
of
water
from
end
to
end
then
they
paused
and
frank
saying
he
was
beginning
to
feel
tired
turned
over
on
his
back
for
a
little
rest
jack
forthwith
imitating
his
example
sakes
alive
but
this
water
is
cold
cried
jack
if
we
stay
in
it
much
longer
be
getting
the
cramps
make
for
the
shore
all
right
go
ahead
after
you
replied
frank
jack
accordingly
turned
his
face
shoreward
and
trying
the
side
stroke
now
was
making
pretty
good
progress
having
got
about
in
when
a
cry
from
frank
who
was
a
few
yards
behind
made
him
stop
suddenly
and
wheel
round
to
see
what
was
the
matter
come
here
jack
said
frank
in
a
troubled
voice
and
jack
immediately
went
back
to
him
the
matter
old
chap
asked
he
anxiously
why
answered
frank
i
seem
to
be
losing
all
my
strength
see
i
can
hardly
take
a
stroke
and
sure
enough
his
strength
seemed
to
have
left
him
and
instead
of
the
wide
powerful
sweeps
he
usually
made
he
could
manage
to
do
little
more
than
paddle
enough
with
his
hands
to
keep
his
head
afloat
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
he
had
been
seized
with
muscular
cramp
and
was
in
great
danger
for
there
was
no
boat
in
sight
and
the
shore
lay
nearly
fifty
yards
away
with
water
deep
enough
between
to
swallow
an
ocean
steamer
jack
fully
realized
the
danger
but
was
too
sensible
to
say
so
taking
a
firm
grasp
of
right
shoulder
with
his
left
hand
he
said
cheerily
come
along
now
give
you
a
lift
then
putting
forth
all
his
strength
he
pushed
frank
forward
while
the
latter
could
just
manage
to
keep
his
head
above
water
and
pointed
in
the
right
direction
in
this
fashion
they
crept
slowly
along
frank
growing
more
helpless
and
jack
more
tired
every
yard
frank
now
could
not
even
keep
his
mouth
above
water
for
the
deadly
cramp
was
drawing
him
all
together
his
back
being
bent
like
a
bow
and
his
arms
and
legs
contracted
until
they
were
almost
altogether
useless
jack
too
began
to
feel
the
cruel
cold
fastening
upon
him
and
his
strength
departing
from
him
his
heart
sank
as
he
looked
at
the
distance
still
ahead
and
felt
himself
weakening
at
every
stroke
in
his
extremity
the
temptation
to
let
go
of
frank
and
strike
for
the
shore
alone
even
flashed
into
his
mind
only
to
be
contemptuously
dismissed
with
the
silent
resolution
to
stay
by
his
friend
whatever
happened
at
length
by
dint
of
grim
determination
jack
got
frank
within
ten
yards
of
the
shore
and
then
feeling
as
though
any
further
effort
on
his
part
were
impossible
he
gave
him
a
big
push
forward
saying
now
then
frank
do
the
rest
yourself
with
a
muffled
cry
of
for
sake
jack
poor
frank
utterly
helpless
went
under
half
turning
over
on
his
back
as
he
did
so
not
for
a
moment
did
jack
hesitate
weak
and
chilled
as
he
was
the
sight
of
his
peril
nerved
him
to
fresh
exertions
and
summoning
all
his
energies
for
one
supreme
final
effort
he
grasped
shoulder
once
more
and
with
desperate
spasmodic
strokes
fought
his
way
through
the
water
never
will
he
forget
that
wrestle
with
death
frank
fortunately
still
keeping
collected
and
quiet
could
get
but
an
occasional
breath
for
now
nearly
his
whole
face
was
submerged
and
jack
himself
seemed
to
be
swimming
in
some
dense
fluid
that
stubbornly
opposed
the
movements
of
his
arms
but
foot
by
foot
he
struggled
on
until
at
length
just
when
every
atom
of
strength
and
hope
seemed
exhausted
he
saw
below
him
the
dark
rock
and
putting
down
his
foot
found
solid
bottom
beneath
him
thank
the
merciful
father
saved
frank
he
cried
half
sobbingly
as
he
drew
his
companion
up
on
to
the
rock
god
bless
you
jack
saved
my
life
replied
frank
with
a
fervour
that
showed
how
clearly
he
understood
the
magnitude
of
the
peril
through
which
he
had
passed
yes
jack
saved
my
life
and
some
day
show
you
how
grateful
i
am
oh
all
right
said
jack
do
the
same
for
me
if
you
had
the
chance
i
hope
i
have
the
chance
all
the
same
answered
frank
for
perhaps
i
keep
as
cool
as
you
did
and
then
where
would
we
be
basking
in
the
hot
sun
took
all
the
cramp
out
of
the
bodies
and
they
went
back
home
not
a
whit
the
worse
for
their
experience
and
a
good
deal
wiser
they
kept
the
matter
to
themselves
prudently
thinking
it
would
only
alarm
their
parents
if
it
came
to
their
ears
and
perhaps
make
them
worry
while
really
there
was
no
occasion
for
further
anxiety
the
following
saturday
afternoon
was
the
time
fixed
for
the
swimming
race
and
the
two
friends
practised
diligently
determined
that
the
sovereign
should
fall
to
one
of
them
at
all
events
or
perhaps
be
divided
between
them
if
they
came
out
a
tie
the
day
dawned
sunnily
and
proved
as
fine
bright
and
warm
as
heart
could
wish
a
great
deal
of
interest
was
felt
in
the
swimming
race
for
at
least
six
boys
had
entered
for
it
and
in
the
afternoon
the
arm
at
the
place
where
the
swimming
would
take
place
was
dotted
over
with
boats
containing
the
fathers
mothers
sisters
cousins
aunts
and
friends
of
the
different
contestants
uncle
william
or
to
give
him
his
proper
title
william
cunard
was
the
judge
at
the
finish
and
the
six
boys
wearing
the
scantiest
possible
bathing
suits
were
rowed
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
arm
in
boats
awfully
excited
said
jack
stone
to
frank
brookfield
on
the
way
over
in
so
low
a
tone
that
none
of
the
other
boys
heard
him
father
says
double
the
prize
if
i
win
but
if
i
win
i
hope
to
goodness
you
will
whoever
wins
will
have
a
hard
fight
for
it
said
frank
both
george
and
hal
can
swim
like
fishes
i
know
about
the
other
two
presently
the
boat
touched
the
shore
and
the
boys
all
leaped
out
and
took
up
their
positions
upon
the
ledge
of
rock
from
which
they
were
to
start
are
you
ready
called
out
the
starter
then
go
and
with
a
tremendous
splash
the
whole
six
plunged
into
the
water
like
one
man
the
next
moment
they
were
all
at
the
surface
again
and
cleaving
the
calm
water
at
the
top
of
their
speed
frank
was
using
his
favourite
overhand
stroke
jack
the
side
stroke
and
the
rest
the
ordinary
breast
stroke
for
some
distance
there
was
little
difference
between
them
you
might
have
covered
them
with
a
handkerchief
so
to
speak
then
little
by
little
frank
and
jack
keeping
well
together
began
to
draw
away
from
george
and
hal
who
in
their
turn
led
the
other
two
by
the
time
the
centre
of
the
arm
was
reached
it
was
plain
to
all
that
the
race
lay
between
the
two
friends
and
amid
cheers
and
shouts
of
go
it
frank
hit
her
up
jack
pretty
work
both
of
you
keep
it
up
they
ploughed
through
the
water
side
by
side
illustration
jack
felt
himself
weakening
of
the
distance
was
now
covered
and
their
positions
were
unchanged
when
with
a
pang
that
went
right
to
his
heart
jack
felt
himself
weakening
inch
by
inch
his
stroke
shortened
and
first
head
then
his
neck
then
his
shoulders
slipped
past
him
gritting
his
teeth
with
fierce
determination
and
breathing
hard
he
strained
every
nerve
to
recover
his
lost
ground
but
all
in
vain
frank
gained
steadily
until
his
heels
were
in
a
line
with
head
already
they
were
raising
the
shouts
of
victory
when
frank
turning
to
see
what
lead
he
had
caught
sight
of
pale
face
in
which
disappointment
and
despair
were
already
showing
themselves
and
it
brought
up
in
his
mind
that
same
face
a
week
before
when
pallid
but
resolute
just
as
it
was
now
it
cut
the
water
close
beside
him
while
the
boy
to
whom
it
belonged
struggled
so
bravely
with
the
death
that
threatened
a
mist
came
in
his
eyes
and
a
lump
rose
in
his
throat
as
he
thought
of
this
he
saved
my
life
he
murmured
to
himself
hallo
up
with
frank
said
cunard
he
has
almost
stopped
he
must
be
done
out
just
shove
out
that
boat
there
toward
him
will
you
go
on
and
win
old
chap
said
frank
to
jack
when
the
latter
came
up
to
him
used
up
just
paddle
in
slowly
oh
all
right
he
added
as
jack
showed
signs
of
stopping
to
help
him
tired
out
all
cheer
after
cheer
rang
out
as
jack
nearly
exhausted
himself
but
undaunted
in
spirit
swept
by
frank
now
paddling
quite
leisurely
and
finished
the
course
amidst
a
general
chorus
of
congratulation
he
felt
as
proud
as
punch
and
when
frank
came
ashore
threw
his
arms
around
him
affectionately
saying
a
dear
good
fellow
to
let
me
beat
you
not
that
he
had
the
slightest
suspicion
as
to
how
it
had
really
happened
frank
never
told
him
indeed
he
never
told
anybody
except
his
mother
and
she
alone
of
all
the
people
who
witnessed
it
knew
the
secret
of
frank
sudden
collapse
in
the
swimming
match
at
the
arm
lasting
impression
harold
harold
harold
cried
owen
at
the
top
of
her
clear
strong
voice
her
anxiety
increasing
as
no
answer
came
back
mercy
on
me
what
can
have
become
of
that
boy
as
sure
as
anything
he
has
gone
down
to
the
wharf
after
all
that
i
have
said
to
him
too
i
do
wish
something
would
make
a
lasting
impression
upon
him
and
with
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
she
could
not
shake
off
the
troubled
mother
went
back
to
her
sighing
over
her
disobedience
now
harold
owen
was
not
really
a
bad
boy
he
loved
his
mother
dearly
and
always
felt
sorry
when
he
had
grieved
her
but
he
was
such
a
thoughtless
little
chap
eight
years
old
last
october
stout
cheery
and
brave
full
to
overflowing
of
animal
spirits
eager
to
do
everything
he
saw
the
older
boys
doing
and
always
wanting
to
be
with
them
quite
as
heedless
and
forgetful
as
he
was
affectionate
and
obliging
sturdy
little
hal
was
just
the
kind
of
boy
to
make
a
mother
whose
only
child
he
was
no
less
anxious
than
proud
about
him
and
in
these
lovely
summer
days
when
nobody
wanted
to
be
indoors
between
daylight
and
dark
except
to
eat
their
meals
poor
owen
had
her
hands
full
in
trying
to
keep
track
of
her
son
who
would
stray
off
in
spite
of
her
orders
to
stay
near
home
you
see
harold
did
not
just
mean
to
flatly
disobey
his
mother
for
days
together
he
would
do
exactly
what
she
told
him
and
make
her
very
happy
but
every
now
and
then
some
of
the
boys
in
the
hardie
perhaps
or
frank
come
along
and
get
talking
with
hal
over
the
garden
fence
and
as
sure
as
they
did
it
ended
in
the
little
forgetting
all
about
his
commands
and
going
off
to
the
wharves
where
sometimes
he
stayed
so
long
as
to
give
his
mother
quite
a
fright
that
was
exactly
what
had
happened
this
glorious
july
morning
when
owen
missing
her
shouts
from
the
front
garden
ran
out
to
the
door
her
bare
arms
all
white
with
flour
for
she
had
been
making
a
cake
and
called
harold
harold
harold
so
loud
that
you
might
have
heard
her
down
to
the
wharves
if
indeed
she
could
have
been
heard
all
the
way
down
perhaps
her
call
might
have
brought
harold
back
and
in
that
case
he
should
not
have
got
his
lasting
impression
and
i
would
have
had
no
story
to
tell
but
just
at
this
time
our
little
man
was
altogether
too
much
taken
up
with
what
jack
hardie
was
telling
him
to
hear
anything
less
noisy
than
a
bet
my
boots
hal
you
never
saw
such
a
funny
little
chap
in
your
life
he
is
about
as
big
as
our
baby
but
nothing
like
so
fat
and
he
has
long
hair
all
over
his
face
he
jumps
around
and
talks
away
at
the
fellows
and
sits
up
on
his
hind
legs
to
eat
nuts
and
crackers
oh
i
tell
you
lots
of
fun
illustration
rescuer
and
this
was
part
of
account
of
a
very
interesting
monkey
belonging
to
the
black
cook
of
a
large
ship
then
at
the
wharf
and
it
was
the
promise
of
showing
him
this
boy
could
resist
such
a
temptation
had
lured
hal
away
from
home
down
to
the
wharf
they
ran
as
fast
as
their
legs
could
carry
them
and
there
they
found
other
youngsters
much
about
their
own
age
all
evidently
bent
on
the
same
errand
the
stately
lay
right
across
the
end
of
the
wharf
and
was
being
fed
with
long
yellow
deals
that
would
make
houses
in
england
some
day
the
boys
stood
for
a
while
watching
the
huge
planks
sliding
through
the
into
the
dark
mysterious
hold
and
then
there
was
a
general
rush
for
the
stern
where
they
expected
to
find
the
by
which
they
would
climb
on
board
but
much
to
their
disappointment
no
ladder
could
they
see
and
no
way
of
climbing
up
except
a
thick
rope
that
dangled
over
the
side
reaching
quite
down
to
the
wharf
the
truth
of
the
matter
being
that
the
sailors
getting
rather
tired
of
the
frequent
invasions
had
taken
away
the
ladder
and
put
the
rope
in
its
place
thinking
thus
to
put
a
stop
to
their
coming
on
board
the
tide
was
high
and
the
great
black
hull
of
the
ship
towered
above
the
wharf
like
the
side
of
a
house
the
boys
looked
pretty
blank
at
first
but
then
you
know
it
takes
a
good
deal
to
stop
an
enterprising
boy
when
his
heart
is
set
on
anything
and
presently
after
a
little
talk
together
jack
hardie
said
he
would
see
if
he
shin
up
the
rope
so
he
clasped
the
rope
tight
in
his
brown
fists
twined
his
strong
legs
around
it
and
up
he
went
not
very
fast
to
be
sure
but
gaining
a
bit
at
every
wriggle
until
at
last
he
reached
the
bulwarks
and
the
boys
gave
him
a
cheer
as
he
called
out
come
along
fellows
not
so
hard
you
can
all
do
it
frank
lawson
tried
next
and
he
got
up
all
right
then
charley
wright
followed
and
now
master
harold
thought
he
would
try
his
luck
so
too
did
jim
norton
and
when
harold
got
the
rope
first
it
made
jim
so
cross
that
like
the
rough
heedless
chap
he
was
he
gave
hal
an
angry
push
just
as
the
little
man
had
let
go
from
the
wharf
and
was
clinging
to
the
rope
of
course
jim
did
not
really
mean
any
harm
but
he
came
pretty
near
doing
dreadful
harm
all
the
same
for
his
push
was
such
a
hard
one
that
it
loosened
unlucky
little
hold
upon
the
rope
and
with
a
cry
of
fright
down
he
dropped
between
the
vessel
and
the
wharf
falling
with
a
great
splash
into
the
dark
green
water
poor
little
hal
you
may
well
wish
you
had
not
disobeyed
your
orders
for
now
there
is
small
chance
of
your
ever
being
able
to
disobey
them
again
the
tide
had
begun
to
run
out
and
although
harold
struggled
up
to
the
surface
twice
so
that
his
terrified
playmates
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
pale
frightened
face
for
a
moment
the
cruel
current
dragged
him
down
again
and
the
horrid
salt
water
rushed
into
his
mouth
as
he
opened
it
to
cry
for
help
his
father
had
given
him
some
lessons
in
swimming
that
summer
and
he
tried
to
put
them
in
practice
now
striking
out
bravely
with
his
plump
fists
and
sturdy
legs
but
of
course
such
swimming
as
that
could
not
help
him
and
he
sank
deeper
and
deeper
then
at
last
he
gave
up
trying
to
save
himself
he
lost
all
sense
of
suffering
and
as
he
drifted
passively
away
with
the
current
a
strange
thing
happened
to
that
he
will
never
forget
though
he
lives
a
hundred
it
was
this
all
his
past
life
appeared
before
his
mind
in
a
series
of
pictures
in
fact
just
like
the
panorama
of
the
american
rebellion
he
had
enjoyed
the
winter
before
all
his
doings
good
and
bad
but
more
particularly
the
bad
ones
seemed
to
come
up
clearly
before
him
and
as
he
saw
what
a
naughty
thoughtless
boy
he
had
been
he
felt
sorry
enough
never
to
disobey
his
dear
fond
mother
again
but
it
too
late
now
what
up
in
the
sunshine
once
more
and
sitting
on
the
solid
yellow
deals
with
his
companions
crowding
round
him
laughing
and
crying
and
patting
him
on
the
back
and
acting
so
comically
while
all
the
time
the
water
is
dripping
down
off
his
clothes
and
making
a
puddle
at
his
feet
and
he
does
feel
so
uncomfortable
underneath
his
blouse
and
who
is
the
big
strong
man
standing
near
just
as
wet
as
himself
and
looking
at
him
with
his
handsome
bronzed
face
full
of
pride
and
pleasure
and
that
father
coming
down
the
wharf
as
hard
as
he
can
run
with
face
so
white
that
he
looks
like
a
ghost
bewildered
little
hal
at
first
understand
what
it
all
meant
and
when
his
father
catching
him
up
in
his
arms
pressed
him
passionately
to
his
breast
the
little
man
just
burst
out
crying
and
hid
his
wet
face
on
his
shoulder
in
this
fashion
he
went
back
home
the
boys
following
in
a
triumphal
procession
an
hour
afterwards
when
master
harold
had
got
rid
of
the
uncomfortable
feeling
under
his
blouse
and
put
on
a
warm
dry
suit
of
clothes
jack
hardie
told
him
how
when
he
fell
plump
into
the
water
the
boys
had
all
shouted
out
for
help
and
how
the
mate
of
the
had
sprung
out
of
his
cabin
at
the
first
cry
and
directed
by
jack
without
waiting
even
to
take
off
his
coat
had
dived
right
down
into
the
deep
dark
water
how
he
had
come
up
once
without
finding
hal
and
after
taking
breath
had
gone
down
a
second
time
in
search
of
him
how
he
had
hunted
around
in
the
water
until
at
last
seeing
something
black
below
him
he
had
stretched
down
his
leg
and
his
toe
catching
hal
under
the
chin
the
gallant
mate
drew
him
up
into
his
arms
and
then
made
for
the
daylight
and
how
when
harold
first
came
out
of
the
water
he
seemed
to
be
dead
but
in
a
few
minutes
came
to
life
again
and
sat
up
blinking
his
eyes
like
a
young
baby
all
this
and
more
too
did
jack
hardie
proud
of
having
such
an
besides
and
owen
a
dozen
or
more
of
the
neighbours
had
run
in
to
hear
all
about
with
great
gusto
and
as
harold
realized
how
very
near
he
had
come
to
losing
his
life
and
looked
into
his
darling
face
streaming
with
tears
of
joy
and
gratitude
which
but
for
the
brave
sailor
would
have
been
tears
of
bitter
sorrow
he
gathered
up
his
little
features
into
a
most
determined
expression
and
said
mother
never
disobey
you
again
thus
did
his
mother
get
her
wish
and
master
harold
his
lasting
impression
which
many
a
time
saved
him
from
falling
again
into
disobedience
wilberforce

wilby
wilby
come
here
i
want
you
called
a
shrill
voice
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
down
from
the
little
attic
room
came
the
answer
promptly
all
right
mother
just
coming
a
minute
later
a
stout
hearty
lad
of
fifteen
presented
himself
before
his
mother
and
dutifully
awaited
her
commands
why
wilby
said
she
i
was
just
thinking
i
had
better
send
you
over
to
aunt
to
tell
her
that
your
father
was
going
to
town
pretty
sure
to
want
him
to
do
something
for
her
and
he
goes
so
seldom
nowadays
be
disappointed
if
we
let
her
know
well
mother
replied
the
boy
looking
rather
doubtfully
out
of
the
window
from
which
a
vast
expanse
of
desolate
fields
could
be
seen
not
just
the
best
kind
of
an
afternoon
to
be
going
away
over
to
a
heap
of
snow
on
the
ground
awfully
cold
and
the
rising
tut
what
does
a
big
strong
boy
like
you
care
for
the
cold
besides
you
can
put
on
your
and
take
the
short
cut
through
the
you
feel
the
wind
in
the
woods
i
really
must
send

have
time
to
go
over
himself
very

all
the

i
wish
it
could

so
saying
wilby
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
went
off
to
get
ready
for
his
tramp
it
was
no
trifling
affair
this
errand
over
to
aunt
i
can
tell
you
she
lived
six
good
miles
away
by
the
road
and
even
taking
the
short
cut
through
the
pasture
and
it
was
not
less
than
four
miles
of
course
with
fine
weather
and
good
going
four
miles
was
not
much
of
a
task
for
sturdy
legs
and
he
never
failed
to
get
so
warm
a
welcome
and
such
delicious
cake
at
his
that
generally
he
was
only
too
glad
to
go
but
in
with
four
feet
of
snow
on
the
ground
the
thermometer
right
down
to
zero
and
the
wind
cutting
like
a
knife
it
seemed
a
very
different
matter
however
wilby
as
his
mother
called
him
for
short
wilberforce
being
kept
for
company
or
for
when
she
wanted
to
be
very
emphatic
was
quite
as
plucky
as
he
was
obedient
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
his
mother
first
called
him
he
started
out
on
his
errand
muffled
up
to
the
eyes
with
his
well
strapped
to
his
feet
and
his
good
dog
oscar
trotting
along
beside
him
it
was
well
for
him
that
he
did
have
wise
old
oscar
as
we
shall
presently
see
bending
his
head
low
so
as
to
protect
his
face
as
much
as
possible
from
the
keen
wind
and
swinging
his
arms
to
and
fro
in
time
with
his
stride
wilby
went
swiftly
down
the
hillside
across
the
river
and
up
the
other
slope
until
he
reached
the
shelter
of
the
woods
where
the
wind
bothered
him
no
longer
and
he
could
take
things
more
quietly
oscar
ran
soberly
along
at
his
heels
and
wilby
was
glad
of
his
company
for
the
short
winter
day
was
already
drawing
to
a
close
and
the
lonely
was
not
the
most
cheerful
place
in
the
world
to
be
in
at
that
time
wilby
was
a
great
boy
for
books
and
had
just
finished
reading
colonel
delightful
story
the
voyage
of
the
of
which
the
most
interesting
part
to
him
had
been
that
relating
to
the
polar
bears
and
now
as
he
trudged
steadily
along
through
the
silent
woods
he
fell
to
thinking
about
these
bears
and
wondering
what
he
should
do
supposing
he
should
meet
one
of
course
he
knew
well
enough
that
the
nearest
white
bear
was
at
least
a
thousand
miles
away
and
that
even
an
ordinary
black
bear
had
not
been
seen
in
that
neighbourhood
for
years
but
all
the
same
he
could
not
get
those
cruel
white
monsters
out
of
his
thoughts
in
fact
he
became
quite
nervous
over
them
and
would
peer
eagerly
ahead
and
anxiously
around
just
as
if
one
of
them
might
rush
in
upon
him
at
any
minute
at
length
his
nervousness
got
so
much
the
better
of
him
that
walking
seemed
altogether
too
slow
and
he
started
off
on
the
hard
run
only
two
miles
of
the
distance
to
aunt
was
left
at
this
time
and
one
of
these
soon
disappeared
as
wilby
hurried
onward
with
oscar
bounding
joyfully
beside
him
ten
minutes
more
at
the
farthest
and
they
would
be
safe
at
their
destination
already
wilby
thought
he
could
catch
through
the
trees
a
gleam
of
light
from
the
kitchen
window
when
suddenly
something
unfortunate
happened
it
had
been
hard
work
keeping
to
the
wood
path
so
buried
was
it
under
the
snow
and
he
must
have
strayed
a
little
from
it
for
he
found
his
way
barred
by
a
huge
which
certainly
ought
not
to
have
been
there
the
wisest
thing
of
course
would
have
been
to
retrace
his
steps
a
bit
but
instead
of
that
wilby
rashly
tried
a
running
leap
over
the
obstacle
and
it
was
not
a
success
without
he
might
have
cleared
it
easily
but
with
these
encumbrances
on
his
feet
he
not
only
made
a
very
poor
attempt
but
in
some
way
or
other
they
got
entangled
together
and
in
a
violent
effort
to
keep
his
balance
he
sprained
his
right
ankle
so
badly
that
to
his
great
dismay
he
found
he
could
no
longer
bear
any
weight
upon
it
here
was
a
pretty
state
of
affairs
indeed
a
whole
mile
from
aunt
not
yet
clear
of
the
woods
not
a
living
soul
within
reach
of
his
voice
his
right
leg
utterly
useless
and
hurting
awfully
and
the
cold
growing
more
intense
every
minute
it
did
not
take
poor
wilby
long
to
realize
that
he
was
in
no
little
danger
as
he
could
do
nothing
with
his
he
took
them
off
and
tried
to
get
along
without
them
but
the
snow
was
so
dry
and
soft
that
he
sank
right
into
it
and
could
make
no
advance
at
all
his
only
hope
seemed
to
be
to
shout
at
the
top
of
his
voice
on
the
small
chance
of
somebody
hearing
him
so
he
called
for
help
with
all
his
might
oscar
was
much
puzzled
by
his
conduct
and
circled
impatiently
around
him
as
if
to
urge
him
onward
for
quite
a
long
time
wilby
shouted
until
what
between
cold
and
weariness
there
was
no
more
shout
left
in
him
presently
he
felt
an
intense
longing
to
sleep
stealing
over
him
he
strove
desperately
hard
to
shake
it
off
for
he
knew
well
what
it
meant
but
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
the
deadly
drowsiness
crept
steadily
and
surely
over
his
senses
and
he
was
just
lapsing
into
unconsciousness
when
there
was
a
crashing
in
the
underbrush
ahead
and
before
he
had
time
to
ask
himself
what
it
could
be
the
small
trees
in
front
of
him
parted
violently
and
out
stepped
a
great
white
bear
what
do
you
mean
by
all
this
shouting
he
demanded
rather
crossly
curiously
enough
wilby
was
not
quite
so
terrified
as
he
expected
he
would
be
if
a
white
bear
happened
along
and
found
courage
to
say
very
humbly
please
bear
i
hope
i
disturb
you
but
you
see
sprained
my
ankle
badly
and
i
was
shouting
for
some
one
to
come
and
help
me
ho
ho
you
are
hurt
are
you
was
the
reply
in
rather
a
gentler
tone
well
look
after
you
and
so
saying
the
bear
picked
the
big
boy
up
in
his
arms
as
though
he
had
been
a
little
baby
and
marched
off
with
him
through
the
woods
at
a
rapid
rate
wilby
knew
resistance
was
vain
so
he
just
made
up
his
mind
to
take
things
as
quietly
as
possible
which
under
the
circumstances
was
a
very
wise
thing
to
do
after
about
five
walking
his
captor
came
to
a
large
tree
which
had
been
torn
up
by
the
roots
under
this
he
quickly
dodged
and
entered
what
seemed
to
be
a
long
dark
passage
in
spite
of
his
good
resolution
wilby
could
not
help
a
kind
of
groan
at
this
shut
up
growled
the
bear
giving
him
a
by
no
means
gentle
cuff
on
the
side
of
the
head
wilby
did
shut
up
and
for
a
time
nothing
was
to
be
heard
save
the
soft
thump
thump
thump
of
the
broad
feet
on
the
hard
floor
of
the
passage
at
last
they
stopped
the
bear
gave
something
a
kick
a
door
flew
open
inward
and
then
there
burst
upon
the
bewildered
wilby
such
a
sight
as
he
had
never
even
dreamed
of
in
his
life
before
he
found
himself
in
a
large
room
flooded
with
light
and
warmth
from
a
glorious
wood
fire
that
was
crackling
away
in
a
huge
fireplace
at
one
end
at
first
he
thought
the
whole
place
had
just
been
newly
whitewashed
but
soon
discovered
his
mistake
everything
in
and
about
that
room
was
and
glistening
as
the
snow
outside
floor
walls
ceiling
were
all
marble
alike
and
they
looked
wonderfully
fine
with
the
firelight
flashing
upon
them
but
before
wilby
had
time
to
take
much
more
in
he
heard
a
deep
bass
voice
asking
hallo
major
what
have
you
got
there
and
turning
his
head
he
saw
a
splendid
white
bear
a
good
deal
bigger
than
his
rescuer
coming
toward
them
from
the
far
end
of
the
room
some
son
max
answered
the
major
at
the
same
time
gently
depositing
his
load
on
a
couch
near
the
fire
i
found
him
frozen
to
death
in
a
i
guess
we
can
make
him
all
right
again
of
course
we
can
exclaimed
another
voice
much
livelier
in
tone
than
the
first
and
a
third
bear
quite
as
white
but
not
so
tall
as
either
of
the
others
emerged
into
the
firelight
from
a
dark
corner
where
he
had
been
attending
to
some
household
duty
of
course
we
can
if
you
say
so
minor
growled
the
one
called
max
begin
by
giving
him
a
good
dinner
at
all
events
by
the
way
i
forgot
to
mention
that
the
full
names
of
new
friends
were
ursa
minor
ursa
major
and
ursa
maximus
but
for
sake
they
called
one
another
simply
minor
major
and
max
feeling
surprisingly
at
his
ease
in
view
of
his
strange
surroundings
wilby
stretched
himself
out
on
his
comfortable
couch
and
almost
forgot
the
pain
from
his
sprained
ankle
in
his
delight
at
his
novel
experience
what
a
lot
have
to
tell
them
at
home
he
said
exultingly
to
himself
they
believe
of
it
i
know
maximus
was
evidently
head
of
the
household
and
superintended
in
a
dignified
way
while
major
and
minor
bustled
about
getting
dinner
ready
in
a
little
while
all
the
preparations
were
complete
and
major
who
seemed
to
feel
especially
responsible
for
wilby
brought
him
a
steaming
bowl
of
something
which
the
hungry
boy
was
not
long
in
sampling
and
it
proved
to
be
such
delicious
that
he
could
not
help
exclaiming
my
sakes
but
this
is
fine
mother
make
a
better
stew
herself
compliment
pleased
minor
who
had
prepared
the
stew
so
much
that
he
filled
bowl
up
again
before
it
was
fairly
empty
besides
the
stew
there
were
roast
partridges
and
baked
potatoes
and
also
apples
and
nuts
so
that
wilby
had
just
about
as
much
as
he
could
comfortably
fact
perhaps
a
little
more
at
all
events
his
waistband
began
to
remind
him
it
was
there
dinner
over
the
dishes
were
cleared
away
and
the
room
set
in
order
again
wilby
watching
everything
with
the
liveliest
interest
determined
to
have
such
a
story
to
tell
as
would
make
him
the
hero
of
the
for
a
whole
month
at
least
he
was
particularly
struck
with
the
deftness
with
which
the
bears
went
about
their
work
although
their
big
paws
looked
clumsy
enough
the
dear
knows
they
did
things
as
handily
as
wilby
himself
could
have
done
them
when
every
sign
of
the
dinner
had
vanished
max
major
and
minor
drew
up
their
chairs
for
they
each
had
a
big
in
front
of
the
fire
and
sat
down
to
talk
over
the
events
of
the
day
quite
ignoring
the
addition
to
their
family
indeed
was
very
well
pleased
at
being
left
alone
as
he
much
preferred
using
his
eyes
to
his
tongue
when
everything
around
him
was
so
delightfully
novel
the
voices
were
so
low
and
deep
that
wilby
could
not
make
out
they
were
saying
besides
what
with
the
warmth
of
the
room
and
his
own
weariness
he
began
to
feel
very
sleepy
again
especially
as
the
couch
was
extremely
comfortable
in
fact
he
had
just
about
dozed
off
when
he
was
awakened
by
maximus
jumping
up
from
his
chair
and
saying
in
a
loud
tone
come
fellows
let
us
have
a
song
and
then
turn
in
whereupon
the
three
of
them
stood
up
together
around
the
fire
and
sang
very
heartily
the
following
song
the
words
of
which
so
far
as
he
heard
them
wilby
had
no
difficulty
in
remembering
although
the
tune
went
completely
out
of
his
head
he
had
not
much
of
an
ear
for
music
any
way
three
jolly
white
bears
are
we
who
can
sing
right
merrily
for
our
hearts
are
light
and
free
from
any
care
we
have
always
lots
to
eat
and
we
keep
our
house
so
neat
that
really
quite
a
treat
to
be
a
bear
yes
indeed
happy
bears
since
nobody
knows
our
lairs
where
we
mind
our
own
affairs
so
quietly
of
course
we
have
to
work
but
none
of
us
ever
shirk
for
be
a
lazy
lark
you
see
when
the
snow
is
on
the
ground
we
go
hunting
all
around
for
the
bunnies
which
abound
among
the
trees
and
when
is
here
how
the
berries
disappear
down
our
but
wilby
never
heard
the
end
of
the
third
verse
for
the
simple
reason
that
sleep
overcame
him
just
then
and
song
singers
and
marble
palace
alike
faded
away
into
nothingness
he
had
no
idea
how
long
he
slept
but
when
he
awoke
he
was
both
surprised
and
disappointed
to
find
himself
on
the
sofa
in
aunt
very
plain
though
cozy
instead
of
on
his
couch
in
white
bear
castle
while
now
not
only
his
ankle
but
his
whole
body
gave
him
nerve
tingling
and
face
and
hands
smarting
dreadfully
minor
major
and
maximus
were
all
gone
too
and
in
their
place
dear
old
aunt
matilda
and
kind
uncle
lemuel
were
bending
over
him
with
faces
full
of
relief
at
his
return
to
consciousness
o
wilby
dear
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
open
your
eyes
again
exclaimed
aunt
matilda
joyfully
you
were
so
long
coming
to
that
i
began
to
fear
that
it
might
be
all
over
with
you
yes
wilby
my
boy
added
uncle
lemuel
had
a
close
shave
but
for
oscar
there
would
not
be
much
life
left
in
you
by
this
time
wilby
was
too
dazed
for
some
time
to
understand
it
all
but
later
on
his
uncle
explained
the
matter
it
seemed
that
wise
old
oscar
as
soon
as
wilby
lost
his
senses
scampered
off
to
uncle
as
hard
as
he
could
go
and
by
barking
and
scratching
at
the
door
soon
let
them
know
he
was
there
then
by
signs
whose
meaning
they
were
not
long
in
guessing
he
persuaded
them
to
go
back
with
him
until
poor
wilby
was
found
where
he
had
fallen
beside
the
big
tree
oscar
capered
about
wild
with
delight
when
his
master
was
carried
off
to
the
house
and
uncle
lem
could
not
say
enough
about
his
cleverness
wilby
felt
very
grateful
to
oscar
and
to
his
uncle
also
and
thankful
that
he
had
not
lost
his
life
yet
he
could
not
help
a
twinge
of
regret
at
the
thought
of
never
seeing
his
white
bear
friends
again
seeing
how
kindly
they
had
treated
him
in
spite
of
their
character
for
cruelty
however
it
was
no
small
consolation
to
have
such
a
rattling
good
story
to
tell
and
tell
it
he
did
very
graphically
many
a
time
much
to
the
enjoyment
of
his
hearers
whether
they
all
believed
it
or
not
is
a
question
that
if
you
do
not
mind
i
will
leave
it
to
you
to
settle
the
boom
mort
henshaw
was
a
boy
who
had
implicit
faith
in
himself
he
cherished
the
firm
conviction
that
whatever
any
other
boy
could
do
came
within
the
range
of
his
capabilities
he
had
only
to
find
out
the
way
it
should
be
done
in
order
to
accomplish
it
this
was
a
pretty
large
view
to
take
of
things
in
general
yet
it
must
be
confessed
that
mort
was
not
without
a
fair
degree
of
justification
for
having
what
the
scotch
would
call
so
good
a
conceit
of
himself
blessed
with
a
strong
symmetrical
frame
a
quick
eye
a
sure
hand
a
perfect
constitution
and
abundant
courage
he
came
easily
by
a
mastery
of
the
different
sports
he
entered
into
and
had
few
equals
and
fewer
superiors
at
cricket
football
lacrosse
baseball
swimming
rowing
and
the
other
amusements
of
the
day
there
was
one
pastime
however
of
which
although
he
had
heard
much
he
knew
nothing
and
that
was
sailing
the
pretty
little
stream
which
ran
by
his
home
afforded
no
facilities
for
this
glorious
sport
and
the
pleasures
of
it
he
knew
about
only
from
the
descriptions
of
his
more
fortunate
companions
great
then
was
his
delight
when
the
spring
that
found
him
fifteen
years
of
age
brought
with
it
an
invitation
from
one
of
his
uncles
to
spend
the
whole
summer
with
him
at
his
cottage
on
lake
deschenes
a
splendid
sheet
of
water
not
far
from
the
city
of
ottawa
the
invitation
mentioned
as
one
of
the
attractions
of
the
place
that
he
would
be
able
to
have
all
the
sailing
that
his
heart
could
wish
hurrah
hurrah
shouted
mort
capering
about
the
room
with
a
face
beaming
like
the
sun
all
the
sailing
i
want
just
think
of
it
that
be
grand
the
very
thing
been
looking
for
it
will
be
grand
mort
dear
said
his
mother
provided
you
take
good
care
not
to
run
any
unnecessary
risks
you
must
do
exactly
what
your
uncle
tells
you
just
as
if
he
were
your
father
oh
yes
mother
do
that
quickly
responded
mort
ready
to
promise
anything
in
the
exuberance
of
his
joy
be
his
crew
you
know
and
obey
orders
just
as
if
i
were
at
sea
with
him
very
impatiently
did
mort
await
the
coming
of
the
day
when
he
should
set
forth
for
deschenes
his
uncle
was
principal
of
the
collegiate
institute
at
ottawa
and
had
three
vacation
which
he
usually
spent
at
the
lake
in
sailing
rowing
bathing
and
fishing
until
the
return
of
autumn
recalled
him
to
his
duties
it
was
the
last
week
in
june
when
mort
arrived
at
lake
deschenes
and
his
first
question
after
exchanging
greetings
with
his
uncle
and
aunt
was
will
you
show
me
your
boat
please
uncle
smiling
at
his
eagerness
turner
took
him
over
to
the
boathouse
where
a
number
of
boats
and
canoes
lay
upon
the
floor
or
were
suspended
upon
racks
against
the
wall
mort
had
never
seen
so
many
or
such
fine
boats
in
his
life
before
they
were
nearly
all
built
of
cedar
and
were
varnished
instead
of
being
painted
the
copper
fastenings
dotting
their
shining
sides
with
regular
lines
the
boy
gave
a
great
gasp
of
admiration
and
it
was
some
time
before
he
recovered
himself
sufficiently
to
ask
and
which
is
your
boat
uncle
turner
pointed
to
one
lying
just
in
front
of
them
oh
what
a
beauty
cried
mort
the
best
of
them
all
his
uncle
smiled
a
complacent
assent
for
that
was
precisely
his
own
opinion
as
to
beauty
of
lines
perfection
of
finish
completeness
of
outfit
and
speed
on
any
tack
he
considered
the
without
a
superior
on
lake
deschenes
and
prompt
recognition
of
the
fact
pleased
him
as
much
as
the
cordial
praise
of
her
baby
does
a
young
mother
you
are
not
far
from
right
my
boy
said
he
the
is
both
a
beauty
to
look
at
and
a
good
one
to
go
as
you
shall
see
for
yourself
very
soon
the
belonged
to
the
class
of
boat
known
as
the
lawrence
skiff
the
swiftest
and
safest
boats
of
their
not
carry
sails
she
was
about
feet
long
and
had
a
all
round
with
a
combing
to
keep
out
the
water
two
tall
masts
carried
big
sails
which
would
have
soon
toppled
her
over
but
for
the
heavy
iron
that
kept
her
stiff
in
an
ordinary
breeze
everything
about
her
was
of
the
best
and
mort
thought
her
the
most
beautiful
object
his
eyes
ever
beheld
that
afternoon
he
had
his
first
sail
in
the
and
as
responding
perfectly
to
every
puff
of
the
wind
and
turn
of
the
tiller
she
went
flying
across
the
lake
his
heart
thrilled
with
delight
and
became
filled
with
a
passionate
desire
to
master
the
art
of
handling
such
a
craft
o
uncle
you
teach
me
how
to
steer
and
to
manage
the
sails
before
i
go
back
home
he
pleaded
looking
earnestly
into
face
certainly
mort
certainly
was
the
kindly
reply
and
i
think
you
ought
to
make
a
very
apt
pupil
too
turner
was
altogether
as
good
as
his
word
he
took
much
pains
in
initiating
mort
into
the
mysteries
of
sailing
teaching
him
the
way
to
tack
when
it
was
permissible
to
jibe
how
to
run
before
the
wind
and
so
forth
until
by
the
end
of
the
first
month
mort
had
become
tolerably
proficient
and
could
be
trusted
to
manage
the
alone
in
an
ordinary
breeze
this
special
privilege
he
was
then
allowed
to
exercise
provided
he
did
not
go
outside
the
boom
is
the
long
line
of
shackled
logs
which
enclosed
the
bay
where
the
boathouse
stood
and
which
was
intended
to
keep
the
from
stranding
on
the
beach
inside
the
boom
was
a
stretch
of
shallow
water
nearly
a
mile
long
by
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
on
which
plenty
of
sailing
might
be
had
without
going
out
through
the
gap
into
the
body
of
the
lake
for
a
time
mort
was
content
with
this
enclosed
space
and
whenever
his
uncle
permitted
him
would
get
the
boat
out
and
go
tacking
up
and
down
from
end
to
end
feeling
almost
as
proud
of
his
skill
as
if
he
had
been
discoverer
of
the
science
of
sailing
but
of
course
it
was
not
many
days
before
he
began
to
cast
longing
eyes
beyond
the
line
of
swaying
logs
and
to
feel
that
the
thing
he
most
desired
in
the
world
was
to
be
allowed
to
sail
the
across
the
lake
and
back
but
when
he
hinted
as
much
to
his
uncle
he
met
with
no
encouragement
no
no
mort
you
must
be
content
with
staying
inside
the
boom
for
besides
the
chance
of
a
squall
there
is
the
danger
of
being
caught
in
the
current
and
carried
into
the
rapids
which
would
soon
make
an
end
of
both
you
and
the
boat
now
it
happened
that
one
morning
both
and
turner
had
to
go
into
the
city
not
to
return
until
by
the
night
train
and
mort
was
left
entirely
to
his
own
resources
of
course
he
turned
to
the
for
company
and
as
soon
as
the
morning
breeze
came
up
taking
with
him
two
other
lads
about
his
own
age
he
launched
the
boat
and
went
skimming
from
end
to
end
of
the
bay
this
is
good
fun
said
ted
day
but
it
would
be
better
still
outside
the
boom
oh
yes
cried
charlie
lister
do
go
outside
just
a
little
bit
mort
mort
shook
his
head
and
tried
to
look
very
decided
his
own
heart
was
beating
a
lively
response
to
the
suggestions
of
his
companions
but
his
answer
was
no
charlie
uncle
does
not
allow
me
to
go
outside
you
know
once
the
idea
had
been
mooted
however
it
refused
to
go
to
rest
again
the
morning
seemed
a
perfect
one
there
was
a
steady
breeze
from
the
just
the
direction
best
suited
for
a
slant
across
the
lake
and
back
without
having
to
tack
at
all
illustration
mort
crawled
upon
the
stage
and
fastened
to
it
the
painter
ted
and
charlie
begged
and
coaxed
mort
to
make
one
trip
out
any
way
turner
would
never
know
anything
about
it
and
they
could
easily
be
back
before
resolution
which
had
been
rapidly
weakening
finally
gave
way
altogether
all
right
said
he
allowing
a
sudden
spirit
of
reckless
ambition
to
submerge
his
compunctions
at
doing
what
he
knew
well
enough
was
a
mean
betrayal
of
his
confidence
in
him
just
make
one
trip
across
it
does
seem
a
pity
to
lose
the
chance
this
glorious
morning
so
out
through
the
gap
the
darted
as
if
glad
of
her
freedom
and
went
flying
over
the
blue
water
toward
blueberry
point
my
but
this
is
grand
exclaimed
charlie
rapturously
as
the
boat
careened
before
the
freshening
breeze
so
that
the
water
lapped
the
you
are
right
it
mort
echoed
ted
turning
to
mort
who
holding
the
tiller
in
one
hand
and
the
end
of
the
main
sheet
in
the
other
watched
every
move
of
the
boat
with
feelings
strangely
divided
between
anxiety
and
proud
delight
the
passage
across
was
quickly
made
and
then
being
thirsty
charlie
proposed
that
they
land
for
a
few
minutes
to
get
a
drink
at
a
spring
near
the
shore
after
the
drink
ted
suggested
a
bathe
and
thus
an
hour
slipped
by
during
which
an
ominous
change
took
place
in
the
weather
the
sky
clouded
over
the
wind
which
had
been
steady
began
to
come
in
fitful
gusts
i
like
the
look
of
things
said
mort
in
a
tone
of
concern
i
wish
we
were
inside
the
boom
well
hurry
and
get
there
as
quickly
as
we
can
responded
ted
it
was
all
well
enough
to
say
this
but
with
the
change
of
weather
had
come
a
change
of
wind
which
was
now
against
them
so
that
they
would
have
to
tack
all
the
way
home
by
dint
of
careful
sailing
they
had
got
about
a
third
of
the
distance
when
suddenly
the
sky
darkened
some
large
drops
of
rain
pattered
upon
them
and
the
next
moment
a
sharp
squall
struck
the
full
upon
her
quarter
in
order
to
give
his
whole
attention
to
the
steering
mort
had
asked
charlie
to
hold
the
impressing
upon
him
to
take
only
one
turn
around
the
cleat
but
charlie
who
was
of
the
lazy
sort
finding
the
sheet
hard
to
hold
had
taken
two
turns
and
done
it
in
such
a
way
that
the
rope
had
jammed
consequently
when
mort
shouted
to
him
as
he
put
the
tiller
hard
let
go
the
instantly
charlie
and
he
attempted
to
obey
the
order
he
could
not
do
so
in
time
to
meet
the
emergency
and
the
next
instant
amid
simultaneous
shrieks
from
all
three
boys
the
went
over
on
her
beam
ends
fortunately
they
were
all
good
swimmers
and
did
not
get
entangled
in
any
of
the
ropes
so
that
without
much
difficulty
they
succeeded
in
climbing
up
on
the
side
of
the
boat
where
it
was
easy
enough
to
hold
on
for
a
while
there
was
no
fear
of
the
sinking
as
she
bore
no
ballast
to
carry
her
down
and
had
compartments
in
both
bow
and
stern
nevertheless
the
position
of
the
boys
was
one
of
great
peril
for
the
boat
was
right
in
the
channel
leading
to
the
rapids
at
the
lower
end
of
the
lake
in
the
direction
of
which
the
wind
was
now
blowing
to
get
into
these
rapids
meant
utter
destruction
for
both
boys
and
boat
yet
to
keep
out
of
them
was
impossible
without
help
while
to
swim
ashore
was
far
beyond
their
powers
they
shouted
and
shrieked
for
aid
but
there
was
no
one
in
sight
to
hear
them
and
soon
the
storm
burst
upon
them
in
full
fury
blotting
out
the
shore
on
both
sides
and
threatening
to
beat
them
off
the
boat
as
it
tossed
up
and
down
in
the
how
bitterly
mort
regretted
having
ventured
beyond
the
boom
and
how
fervently
he
vowed
never
to
do
so
again
if
he
could
only
be
saved
this
time
when
the
squall
passed
and
the
air
cleared
he
saw
that
they
were
fast
drawing
near
the
rapids
o
charlie
he
groaned
why
did
you
make
me
go
outside
the
boom
charlie
made
no
reply
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
but
his
imminent
danger
steadily
and
surely
the
drifted
downward
in
another
fifteen
minutes
she
would
be
in
the
remorseless
grasp
of
the
rapids
the
wind
went
down
almost
to
a
calm
but
the
current
grew
stronger
so
that
there
was
no
slacking
of
her
speeding
toward
destruction
the
boys
held
desperately
on
to
the
keel
saying
nothing
to
each
other
but
praying
as
best
each
could
on
on
the
boat
moved
oh
was
there
no
chance
of
help
must
they
go
down
to
death
in
sight
of
so
many
homes
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
above
the
rapids
was
a
floating
stage
strongly
moored
which
was
used
by
the
men
looking
after
the
that
came
down
the
river
in
great
droves
from
time
to
time
as
they
neared
this
a
bright
thought
flashed
into
mind
say
boys
he
cried
got
it
do
you
see
that
float
push
the
over
to
it
the
others
caught
the
idea
at
once
all
getting
on
the
same
side
of
the
boat
they
proceeded
to
push
her
toward
the
stage
by
swimming
with
their
legs
it
was
exhausting
work
but
they
were
encouraged
by
seeing
that
they
were
making
headway
and
they
persevered
until
at
last
success
crowned
their
efforts
and
with
a
glad
cry
of
relief
mort
crawled
upon
the
stage
and
fastened
to
it
the
painter
all
actual
danger
was
now
over
and
at
once
mort
regained
his
under
his
directions
the
masts
were
taken
out
the
boat
righted
and
bailed
dry
and
everything
stowed
snugly
aboard
then
with
the
oars
she
was
rowed
back
to
deschenes
not
a
whit
the
worse
for
her
wetting
as
soon
as
his
uncle
returned
mort
told
him
the
whole
story
turner
was
very
sorry
to
learn
of
his
breach
of
trust
and
as
a
penalty
therefor
withdrew
from
him
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
the
privilege
of
taking
the
boat
out
alone
which
was
a
sore
deprivation
but
mort
felt
that
it
was
richly
deserved
and
it
only
strengthened
his
resolution
to
be
more
obedient
to
orders
in
the
future
after
many
days
edie
edie
rang
out
in
a
clear
strong
voice
from
the
door
of
a
farmhouse
where
stood
a
comely
woman
shading
her
eyes
with
her
right
hand
as
she
swept
the
sunny
space
around
in
search
of
her
daughter
coming
mother
was
the
prompt
response
and
the
next
instant
there
appeared
from
behind
the
barn
a
little
girl
not
more
than
eight
years
old
who
looked
the
very
picture
of
health
and
happiness
you
know
where
your
chopping
you
edie
asked
hazen
with
a
glance
of
affectionate
pride
at
the
sturdy
little
figure
before
her
oh
yes
mother
replied
edie
swinging
around
and
pointing
with
her
plump
forefinger
stained
by
the
juice
of
the
raspberries
she
had
just
been
picking
to
the
top
of
the
hill
that
sloped
upwards
from
the
other
side
of
the
road
over
there
in
the
back
pasture
near
the
blackberry
patch
right
pet
said
hazen
lifting
up
the
bright
face
for
a
hearty
kiss
and
now
you
like
to
take
him
his
dinner
indeed
i
would
cried
edie
dancing
around
and
clapping
her
hands
and
may
i
stay
with
him
until
he
comes
home
i
suppose
he
wants
you
assented
hazen
but
in
that
case
you
must
come
in
and
have
your
own
dinner
first
a
later
with
a
basket
on
her
arm
and
her
parting
injunction
not
to
loiter
on
the
way
in
her
ears
edie
set
forth
full
of
joy
on
her
mission
a
little
thing
to
send
so
far
mused
the
mother
following
the
retreating
figure
with
eyes
full
of
tender
concern
but
she
does
so
love
the
woods
and
seems
to
make
her
way
through
them
like
an
indian
with
heart
as
light
as
any
bird
chirping
by
the
wayside
edie
hastened
through
the
gate
across
the
road
between
the
lower
bars
of
the
pasture
gate
and
then
climbing
the
hill
behind
which
lay
the
back
pasture
entered
the
bush
in
which
her
pink
calico
soon
vanished
from
view
farm
stood
on
the
very
edge
of
civilization
in
the
northern
part
of
new
brunswick
the
most
of
his
acres
he
had
cleared
himself
and
he
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
hewing
his
way
further
and
further
into
the
mighty
forest
whose
billows
of
birch
pine
and
hemlock
rolled
away
northward
eastward
and
westward
for
uncounted
leagues
this
day
he
was
working
at
a
bunch
of
timber
a
little
beyond
the
eastern
edge
of
the
clearing
called
the
back
pasture
as
drew
near
he
began
to
feel
hungry
and
more
than
once
paused
in
his
work
to
go
to
the
edge
of
the
clearing
to
see
if
there
were
any
signs
of
an
approaching
dinner
i
hope
esther
forgotten
me
he
thought
after
doing
this
for
the
third
time
to
no
result
not
like
her
to
do
it
the
great
golden
sun
moved
steadily
on
to
the
zenith
and
then
inclined
westward
but
still
no
messenger
appeared
bearing
the
needed
refreshment
hazen
felt
strongly
tempted
to
shoulder
his
axe
and
go
home
but
the
day
was
so
favourable
to
his
work
that
after
a
good
deal
of
grumbling
at
what
he
supposed
to
be
his
neglect
he
decided
not
to
quit
it
so
tightening
his
belt
he
grasped
his
axe
anew
and
strove
to
forget
his
hunger
in
the
ardour
of
his
toil
he
did
not
however
work
as
late
as
common
that
day
for
in
addition
to
his
hunger
there
grew
upon
him
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
which
at
length
became
so
disturbing
that
he
could
not
endure
it
accordingly
fully
an
hour
before
his
usual
time
he
shouldered
his
axe
and
strode
off
homeward
saying
to
himself
i
hope
gone
wrong
but
i
know
what
gives
me
such
an
apprehensive
feeling
when
he
approached
the
farmhouse
he
caught
sight
of
his
wife
coming
up
the
road
that
led
to
the
nearest
neighbour
about
away
hurrying
on
to
meet
her
he
asked
in
a
tone
not
altogether
free
from
irritation
at
his
needless
fears
why
esther
where
have
you
been
and
where
is
edie
i
ran
over
to
neighbour
for
the
paper
hazen
responded
but
her
face
filled
with
sudden
edie
edie
with
you
why
no
replied
hazen
while
in
his
face
was
reflected
the
expression
of
his
i
seen
her
since
breakfast
not
seen
her
repeated
hazen
o
henry
what
has
happened
i
sent
her
with
your
dinner
just
before
and
she
asked
me
if
she
might
stay
with
you
until
you
came
home
hazen
was
a
man
prompt
to
action
taking
his
arm
and
fairly
pushing
her
along
the
road
he
said
not
a
moment
to
lose
esther
lost
her
way
and
we
must
go
after
her
without
returning
to
the
farmhouse
they
pressed
up
the
hill
and
through
the
back
pasture
into
the
forest
hither
and
thither
they
hunted
now
one
and
now
the
other
raising
the
echoes
of
the
leafy
fastness
by
calls
of
edie
edie
but
getting
no
response
save
the
cries
of
startled
birds
or
the
mocking
chatter
of
a
squirrel
as
night
drew
on
hazen
realized
that
a
more
organized
effort
was
necessary
and
hastening
home
with
harrowed
hearts
his
wife
got
ready
some
food
while
he
rode
over
to
to
obtain
assistance
both
hewett
and
his
eldest
son
returned
with
him
they
hurriedly
snatched
a
meal
and
then
provided
with
guns
and
lanterns
set
off
to
renew
the
search
all
that
night
they
tramped
through
the
gloom
of
the
forest
meeting
from
time
to
time
to
take
counsel
together
and
then
separating
to
cover
as
much
ground
as
possible
but
the
day
dawned
without
bringing
any
comforting
news
for
the
haggard
woman
who
anxiously
waited
their
return
at
the
gate
and
when
they
came
without
her
daughter
sank
down
on
the
ground
half
fainting
with
uncontrollable
grief
as
soon
as
possible
the
eager
search
was
renewed
and
continued
from
day
to
day
until
at
last
even
the
parents
had
to
give
up
all
hope
and
strove
to
resign
themselves
to
the
awful
conviction
that
their
darling
only
met
her
death
all
alone
in
the
depths
of
the
great
forest
having
either
died
of
hunger
and
exposure
or
fallen
a
victim
to
the
bears
and
wolves
with
which
its
solitudes
abounded
in
the
meantime
how
had
it
fared
with
edie
who
had
gone
forth
so
joyously
to
carry
her
dinner
to
him
her
intention
at
the
start
was
certainly
to
make
a
straight
course
to
her
destination
but
the
attention
of
little
folks
is
easily
attracted
and
in
this
instance
just
as
she
entered
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
should
have
turned
off
to
the
left
a
saucy
little
squirrel
challenged
her
on
the
right
and
in
trying
to
get
near
him
edie
pushed
further
and
further
into
the
forest
until
presently
she
began
to
wonder
if
she
had
not
lost
her
way
at
once
losing
interest
in
the
squirrel
she
put
down
her
basket
to
look
about
her
with
a
pang
of
sharp
dismay
the
child
realized
that
she
had
lost
her
bearings
and
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
just
at
that
moment
her
keen
ear
caught
a
sound
that
she
immediately
recognized
it
was
the
regular
blows
of
an
axe
falling
upon
a
her
face
lit
up
and
she
clapped
her
hands
for
joy
father
chopping
she
exclaimed
now
i
know
which
way
to
go
and
picking
up
her
basket
edie
trotted
off
in
what
she
took
to
be
the
direction
from
which
the
sound
came
on
she
trudged
bravely
for
some
distance
hoping
each
minute
to
come
upon
her
father
until
growing
weary
of
her
burden
she
put
it
down
to
rest
a
moment
as
she
rested
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
sound
of
chopping
had
grown
much
so
indeed
she
could
hardly
make
out
which
way
it
came
to
her
ears
oh
dear
she
sighed
where
can
father
be
call
for
him
and
she
made
the
place
ring
with
shrill
cries
of
father
father
where
are
you
but
they
evoked
no
response
and
then
more
alarmed
than
ever
edie
picked
up
her
basket
again
and
pushed
on
with
all
her
little
strength
unhappily
every
step
increased
the
distance
between
hazen
and
herself
for
it
was
not
the
real
sound
of
the
chopping
edie
had
followed
but
the
echo
and
instead
of
making
toward
him
she
had
been
going
in
directly
the
opposite
direction
at
the
end
of
an
hour
she
felt
very
tired
and
throwing
herself
down
on
a
bank
of
moss
at
the
foot
of
a
forest
monarch
gave
way
to
the
tears
that
hitherto
she
had
resolutely
restrained
oh
dear
she
said
lost
lost
and
how
ever
will
father
find
me
after
the
first
passion
of
tears
had
passed
edie
began
to
be
conscious
of
the
pangs
of
hunger
and
the
thought
came
that
she
might
as
well
eat
something
out
of
the
basket
as
she
could
not
find
her
father
to
give
it
to
him
so
she
ate
a
little
of
the
bread
and
meat
and
took
a
sup
out
of
the
bottle
of
milk
and
then
feeling
refreshed
renewed
her
tramp
first
listening
eagerly
but
in
vain
for
the
sound
of
her
axe
all
that
afternoon
the
lost
child
alternately
walked
and
rested
often
crying
softly
to
herself
then
drying
her
tears
and
seeking
to
take
heart
from
the
hope
of
yet
finding
her
father
before
darkness
came
on
she
was
a
brave
little
thing
accustomed
to
a
good
deal
of
outdoor
life
and
to
running
through
the
woods
but
when
night
closed
around
her
and
the
forest
shade
deepened
into
impenetrable
gloom
poor
edie
gave
up
the
struggle
and
sank
down
in
a
mossy
hollow
shivering
with
terror
yet
so
weary
was
she
that
presently
she
fell
asleep
and
did
not
awake
until
dawn
when
though
feeling
very
stiff
and
sore
from
the
unwonted
exertions
of
the
day
before
she
ate
her
breakfast
out
of
the
basket
and
renewed
her
progress
the
following
day
she
wandered
about
only
getting
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
forest
her
basket
was
empty
before
evening
and
she
was
fain
to
make
her
supper
of
the
berries
which
fortunately
were
very
plentiful
they
were
not
altogether
satisfying
but
they
were
better
than
nothing
another
day
passed
the
weather
providentially
continuing
bright
clear
and
warm
and
the
little
wanderer
still
kept
on
not
knowing
whither
she
was
going
that
night
strange
things
began
to
happen
she
was
more
wakeful
than
usual
and
as
she
lay
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
she
saw
some
large
animals
moving
about
in
the
dim
light
and
her
bosom
thrilled
with
joy
for
she
thought
they
must
be
her
oxen
so
she
called
out
buck
bright
come
here
illustration
he
levelled
his
rifle
in
readiness
to
fire
but
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
they
started
as
if
greatly
frightened
and
at
once
dashed
off
through
the
woods
at
the
top
of
their
speed
which
showed
her
that
they
must
have
been
moose
such
as
her
father
sometimes
shot
the
following
night
two
great
black
shaggy
dogs
which
she
supposed
must
be
neighbour
came
near
her
but
when
she
called
them
by
their
names
they
seemed
more
surprised
than
the
moose
for
they
stood
up
on
their
hind
legs
looked
very
hard
at
her
for
a
few
moments
and
then
dropping
down
on
all
fours
hastened
away
into
the
darkness
again
where
as
edie
thought
she
heard
them
howling
in
this
however
she
must
have
been
doubly
mistaken
what
she
took
to
be
dogs
were
no
doubt
black
bears
then
quite
numerous
in
that
district
being
attracted
by
the
berries
and
the
howling
of
course
was
done
by
wolves
which
luckily
seemed
afraid
to
attack
her
on
the
fourth
afternoon
edie
by
happy
chance
came
across
the
deserted
shanty
of
an
early
pioneer
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
clearing
that
was
thickly
overgrown
with
raspberry
bushes
here
she
remained
for
three
days
feeding
upon
the
berries
during
the
daytime
and
sleeping
in
the
shanty
at
night
the
nights
were
so
warm
that
she
needed
no
fire
and
inside
the
shanty
she
was
safe
from
the
attacks
of
bears
or
wolves
it
was
dreadfully
lonely
yet
still
she
hoped
that
her
father
would
come
and
find
her
a
whole
week
thus
passed
away
edie
had
been
given
up
for
lost
by
her
parents
and
the
neighbours
who
were
assisting
in
the
search
had
returned
to
their
homes
when
a
barker
by
an
experience
such
as
no
sportsman
surely
ever
had
before
he
had
been
out
on
a
hunting
expedition
for
a
fortnight
and
that
day
came
to
the
banks
of
bear
creek
he
was
preparing
to
cross
on
a
fallen
log
almost
spanning
the
stream
when
his
keen
ear
caught
the
sound
of
soft
footsteps
accompanied
by
a
continuous
rustling
movement
in
the
thicket
of
wild
raspberries
that
covered
the
opposite
bank
at
once
with
a
tremor
of
delight
he
suspected
the
approach
of
a
deer
or
possibly
a
bear
and
dropping
behind
a
bush
he
levelled
his
rifle
in
readiness
to
fire
the
next
moment
as
his
eager
eyes
intently
scanned
the
raspberry
bushes
his
feeling
of
delight
suddenly
changed
to
a
thrill
of
horror
when
a
tiny
brown
hand
was
quietly
raised
to
pull
down
a
loaded
branch
of
fruit
well
of
all
things
cried
the
hunter
as
his
finger
fell
from
the
trigger
that
had
so
nearly
sent
the
bullet
upon
its
fatal
mission
what
an
awful
mistake
i
almost
made
throwing
down
his
rifle
he
sprang
across
the
log
to
catch
in
his
arms
a
little
girl
not
more
than
eight
years
old
whose
torn
garments
tangled
locks
soiled
hands
and
thin
pale
face
told
in
a
glance
the
story
of
many
hapless
wanderings
oh
how
glad
poor
edie
was
to
see
him
and
how
artlessly
she
told
the
story
of
her
wonderful
adventures
and
how
thankful
to
providence
the
hunter
was
that
he
had
chanced
to
find
her
ere
it
was
too
late
forgetting
all
about
his
hunting
her
rescuer
now
applied
himself
to
the
task
of
getting
her
home
they
were
far
from
the
nearest
house
and
the
poor
child
was
so
weak
from
lack
of
proper
food
that
he
had
to
lift
her
up
on
his
broad
shoulders
but
barker
was
as
strong
as
he
was
and
he
pushed
resolutely
on
guiding
himself
by
his
compass
until
at
last
just
as
dusk
was
closing
around
them
and
he
began
to
fear
they
would
have
to
pass
another
night
in
the
forest
they
came
upon
a
clearing
at
the
far
side
of
which
stood
a
neat
log
house
edie
shouted
her
joy
at
the
sight
it
meant
that
all
her
perils
were
over
and
the
hunter
putting
on
a
big
spurt
dashed
across
the
clearing
at
a
run
and
deposited
her
on
the
doorstep
exclaiming
in
a
tone
of
vast
relief
there
now
my
child
the
end
of
your
wanderings
the
good
people
of
the
house
gave
them
both
a
warm
welcome
edie
received
every
attention
and
the
following
morning
looking
altogether
a
different
girl
with
dress
mended
hair
neatly
brushed
hands
free
from
and
face
radiant
at
the
prospect
of
returning
to
her
parents
she
took
her
seat
in
the
waggon
to
be
driven
home
how
shall
the
joy
of
the
hazens
be
described
when
the
little
daughter
they
had
mourned
for
as
dead
came
back
to
them
looking
thin
and
worn
it
is
true
but
otherwise
not
a
whit
the
worse
for
her
thrilling
experience
barker
watched
them
with
brimming
eyes
murmuring
as
he
fondly
patted
the
stock
of
his
remington
the
best
work
you
ever
did
was
when
you
go
off
at
all
a
lucky
chance
indeed
gobblers
grundy
or
as
the
boys
disrespectfully
called
her
grumpy
was
certainly
not
a
favourite
with
the
young
people
of
westville
in
the
first
place
she
did
not
like
children
the
fact
that
she
had
never
been
blessed
with
any
of
her
own
no
doubt
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
this
dislike
for
other
which
she
manifested
by
vigorous
use
of
hand
and
tongue
at
the
slightest
provocation
many
a
sharp
speech
and
stinging
slap
did
grundy
not
always
upon
those
who
deserved
it
most
either
for
so
hot
was
her
temper
so
hasty
her
action
when
irritated
that
she
would
visit
her
wrath
upon
the
first
youngster
she
could
reach
without
waiting
to
investigate
the
extent
of
her
luckless
guilt
another
reason
why
grundy
was
not
popular
was
that
although
she
owned
the
finest
orchard
and
garden
in
all
westville
not
one
crimson
strawberry
purple
plum
or
golden
apple
was
she
ever
known
to
bestow
upon
boy
or
girl
and
woe
betide
the
adventurous
urchin
that
dared
to
take
one
unbidden
even
though
it
be
a
windfall
if
he
fell
into
her
strong
hands
forthwith
he
was
marched
off
amid
a
storm
of
slaps
and
scolding
despite
his
sobs
and
vows
of
penitence
into
the
awful
presence
of
squire
hardgrit
and
his
alarmed
parents
having
been
duly
summoned
was
in
their
presence
condemned
to
that
most
appalling
of
whole
day
in
the
house
of
detention
this
method
of
dealing
with
the
or
actual
had
one
advantage
so
far
as
grundy
was
gave
her
a
sharer
in
the
burden
of
her
unpopularity
which
perhaps
might
otherwise
have
proved
insupportable
for
so
hard
cold
and
unsympathetic
was
squire
hardgrit
and
such
evident
pleasure
did
he
take
in
imposing
his
penalties
that
if
the
westville
boys
hated
anybody
as
cordially
as
they
did
grundy
it
was
certainly
the
stern
severe
squire
for
some
time
past
the
relations
between
these
two
worthies
and
the
boys
had
as
the
newspapers
say
about
the
great
powers
been
more
than
usually
strained
not
content
with
fiercely
defending
her
garden
and
orchard
from
juvenile
depredation
grundy
had
asserted
her
right
to
keep
everybody
off
the
broad
smooth
plot
of
grass
that
lay
between
her
cottage
and
the
road
and
had
been
upheld
in
her
claim
by
the
squire
to
the
profound
disgust
of
the
boys
who
had
long
made
it
their
in
the
summer
evenings
for
although
too
small
to
play
a
game
of
baseball
upon
it
was
big
enough
for
pitching
and
catching
chase
and
that
sort
of
thing
this
appropriation
of
the
grass
plot
which
had
hitherto
been
regarded
as
public
property
was
quite
too
much
for
the
boys
it
was
the
last
drop
in
the
cup
of
bitterness
and
in
desperation
they
called
a
meeting
to
be
held
in
barn
on
saturday
night
to
consider
the
situation
saturday
night
came
and
a
dozen
of
the
brightest
boys
of
westville
gathered
in
solemn
conclave
around
a
lantern
to
see
if
some
way
could
not
be
devised
of
getting
even
with
grumpy
and
the
squire
as
the
barn
belonged
to
his
father
charlie
thompson
was
chosen
chairman
and
he
promptly
opened
the
meeting
as
follows
now
fellows
we
stand
this
sort
of
thing
any
longer
something
must
be
done
if
we
perish
in
the
attempt
the
honour
of
the
country
demands
charlie
whose
memory
was
particularly
good
had
not
yet
forgotten
the
last
of
july
oration
that
measures
should
be
taken
to
show
to
our
oppressors
that
we
are
not
slaves
and
cowards
the
meeting
is
now
open
and
the
chair
will
be
pleased
to
receive
suggestions
and
amid
a
vigorous
round
of
applause
charlie
sat
down
feeling
that
he
had
proved
himself
quite
equal
to
the
occasion
for
a
few
moments
there
was
a
dead
pause
all
having
some
sort
of
a
scheme
more
or
less
hazy
in
their
heads
but
none
wishing
to
speak
first
at
last
little
tommy
short
the
youngest
in
the
group
piped
out
tar
and
feather
father
has
lots
of
tar
in
his
back
shop
and
i
know
where
a
big
pot
a
roar
of
laughter
greeted
this
suggestion
the
impracticability
of
which
was
exceeded
only
by
its
absurdity
could
it
have
been
carried
out
dame
grundy
and
squire
hardgrit
would
certainly
have
made
a
most
sight
done
up
in
suits
of
tar
and
feathers
the
speech
served
its
purpose
however
in
loosening
the
other
tongues
and
plans
and
projects
now
poured
in
thick
and
fast
we
burn
their
barns
down
said
dick
wilding
who
was
a
great
reader
of
literature
but
all
the
rest
shouted
no
at
once
what
do
you
say
to
their
horses
asked
bob
henderson
in
rather
a
dubious
tone
as
if
he
had
not
much
confidence
in
the
wisdom
of
his
scheme
which
in
fact
just
occurred
to
him
because
he
had
read
that
that
was
the
way
the
arabs
treat
their
horses
when
they
get
the
chance
stuff
and
nonsense
cried
the
chairman
not
the
sort
of
thing
we
mean
at
all
not
hankering
after
the
penitentiary
give
us
your
plan
then
chairman
said
dick
wilding
well
fellows
tell
you
what
i
was
thinking
of
let
us
hook
the
old
gobblers
and
hide
them
until
she
thinks
gone
for
good
you
know
what
a
heap
she
thinks
of
them
and
it
will
worry
her
awfully
to
lose
them
capital
capital
shouted
the
rest
of
the
boys
the
very
thing
but
where
shall
we
hide
them
asked
sam
lawson
have
to
be
a
pretty
safe
place
for
grumpy
will
turn
the
town
upside
down
hunting
for
her
precious
turkeys
you
may
be
sure
while
all
this
talk
was
going
on
harold
kent
had
been
sitting
on
an
upturned
box
which
served
him
as
a
chair
without
opening
his
mouth
now
however
taking
advantage
of
the
pause
which
followed
question
he
said
quietly
why
not
hide
the
gobblers
in
one
of
the
empty
rooms
in
squire
building
you
know
the
been
trying
to
get
these
bronze
gobblers
from
grumpy
for
ever
so
long
and
she
let
him
have
them
and
if
found
on
his
premises
be
sure
to
think
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
hooking
them
it
was
just
like
harold
to
propose
something
so
original
and
daring
in
its
conception
as
to
fairly
take
his
breath
away
and
they
now
looked
at
him
with
feelings
divided
between
admiration
and
amazement
the
chairman
was
the
first
to
speak
bringing
his
hand
down
upon
his
knee
with
a
crack
that
made
the
others
jump
he
cried
magnificent
boys
do
it
or
perish
in
the
attempt
whereat
the
others
shouted
in
chorus
hoorah
do
it
since
all
agreed
then
said
charlie
the
next
business
before
the
meeting
is
to
plan
how
to
do
it
as
before
all
sorts
of
wild
suggestions
were
put
forward
and
again
it
was
left
for
harold
kent
to
advance
the
most
practicable
scheme
this
was
it
the
shed
in
which
famous
flock
of
turkeys
was
carefully
secured
at
night
stood
at
some
distance
to
the
back
of
her
house
and
as
she
slept
in
one
of
the
front
rooms
there
was
slight
risk
of
her
seeing
or
hearing
anything
what
harold
proposed
was
that
slipping
out
of
their
rooms
after
everybody
was
asleep
they
should
meet
behind
the
bringing
with
them
three
gunny
sacks
and
a
dark
lantern
having
got
the
gobblers
safely
into
the
sacks
they
would
then
creep
round
the
back
way
to
the
building
in
which
the
office
was
situated
climb
in
through
a
lower
window
and
so
upstairs
to
the
room
in
which
the
turkeys
were
to
be
left
a
great
head
hal
said
jack
wilding
admiringly
when
all
this
had
been
detailed
and
you
can
count
on
us
every
he
boys
you
bet
he
can
chorused
the
crowd
a
satisfactory
plan
of
campaign
having
thus
been
settled
upon
the
meeting
was
adjourned
until
monday
midnight
then
to
assemble
behind
the
eventful
night
came
and
as
midnight
drew
near
one
by
one
the
boys
gathered
with
throbbing
hearts
at
the
rendezvous
at
length
all
but
tommy
short
whose
courage
had
failed
him
and
bob
henderson
whose
father
had
nabbed
him
in
the
act
of
slipping
out
and
sent
him
back
to
bed
with
a
spank
turned
up
illustration
they
were
too
bewildered
by
the
blaze
to
make
any
noise
it
was
an
intensely
dark
night
and
blowing
half
a
gale
all
of
which
was
in
favour
of
the
enterprise
the
shed
door
was
found
to
be
simply
secured
with
a
wooden
latch
and
lifting
this
the
conspirators
inside
and
then
charlie
thompson
who
carried
the
dark
lantern
suddenly
turned
its
glare
full
upon
the
startled
gobblers
as
they
nodded
solemnly
side
by
side
upon
their
roost
they
were
too
bewildered
by
the
blaze
to
make
any
noise
and
before
they
could
recover
their
sufficiently
to
exclaim
at
so
extraordinary
an
apparition
the
other
boys
had
stepped
behind
them
and
with
quick
deft
movements
slipped
the
big
sacks
over
their
heads
thus
reducing
them
at
one
bold
stroke
to
helpless
captives
the
poor
turkeys
struggled
and
gobbled
a
good
deal
in
their
narrow
quarters
but
all
to
no
purpose
and
full
of
terror
no
doubt
at
their
strange
treatment
were
hurried
out
of
the
shed
into
the
lane
and
thence
through
dark
and
silent
ways
to
the
rear
of
the
building
here
the
conspirators
paused
for
breath
and
consultation
now
fellows
whispered
harold
kent
we
all
go
inside
you
know
take
the
lantern
while
the
three
biggest
of
you
carry
the
gobblers
and
the
rest
will
stay
here
until
we
come
back
somewhat
reluctantly
this
was
assented
to
for
all
wanted
to
share
the
danger
as
well
as
the
fun
and
then
harold
lantern
in
hand
followed
by
dick
wilding
sam
shaw
and
frank
cushing
each
bending
beneath
a
bag
of
struggling
gobbling
turkey
climbed
in
through
the
low
window
crept
softly
in
stocking
feet
along
the
narrow
hall
and
up
the
creaking
stairs
while
their
companions
with
hearts
beating
like
shrank
close
together
in
the
darkest
corner
outside
and
anxiously
awaited
their
return
it
was
no
easy
task
that
the
four
boys
had
in
hand
true
enough
that
the
building
was
uninhabited
at
night
but
there
were
people
living
next
door
and
any
unusual
noise
could
hardly
fail
to
be
heard
through
those
thin
wooden
walls
while
late
as
the
hour
was
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
plank
would
ever
and
anon
send
a
chill
of
terror
through
the
anxious
watchers
below
moreover
to
carry
three
big
turkeys
up
a
flight
of
stairs
and
deposit
them
in
an
empty
room
without
filling
the
whole
place
with
their
noise
was
the
hardest
part
of
all
nevertheless
they
succeeded
admirably
five
minutes
after
they
disappeared
they
rejoined
their
companions
trembling
but
triumphant
having
left
their
captives
in
good
order
and
condition
in
the
front
room
just
across
the
room
from
squire
office
where
they
would
be
certain
to
make
themselves
seen
and
heard
in
the
morning
this
done
the
boys
scattered
to
their
homes
creeping
back
noiselessly
to
their
beds
in
which
being
thoroughly
tired
out
they
slept
as
soundly
until
morning
as
if
they
had
not
been
up
to
any
mischief
whatever
the
great
of
the
westville
boys
was
the
forge
which
stood
across
the
road
from
and
thither
the
conspirators
came
one
by
one
the
following
morning
in
expectation
of
seeing
the
fun
nor
were
they
disappointed
their
enemy
thought
too
much
of
her
precious
turkeys
to
intrust
any
person
else
with
the
duty
of
feeding
them
and
so
every
morning
carried
them
a
big
dish
of
mush
after
she
had
finished
her
own
breakfast
there
she
goes
exclaimed
dick
wilding
presently
as
the
boys
were
laughing
and
talking
somewhat
nervously
together
and
sure
enough
portly
figure
emerged
from
the
house
and
went
slowly
toward
the
shed
soon
after
a
sharp
cry
of
susan
susan
cut
the
still
morning
air
and
the
prim
was
observed
to
hurry
to
her
mistress
a
moment
later
the
two
women
could
be
observed
running
hither
and
thither
through
the
garden
and
orchard
calling
turkey
turkey
turkey
at
the
top
of
their
voices
great
indeed
was
concern
and
soon
the
whole
neighbourhood
was
made
aware
of
her
loss
those
rascally
gipsies
alive
she
cried
who
else
would
steal
my
beautiful
gobblers
that
i
sell
even
to
the
squire
have
every
one
of
them
sent
to
jail
see
if
i
just
wait
till
the
squire
comes
and
so
she
stormed
while
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
squire
at
his
office
the
moment
he
appeared
she
poured
her
woful
tale
into
his
ears
while
a
curious
crowd
gathered
outside
eager
to
see
what
the
majesty
of
the
law
could
effect
most
prominent
in
the
crowd
were
of
course
the
boys
who
alone
held
the
clue
to
the
mystery
and
were
now
eagerly
expecting
the
grand
it
was
not
long
in
coming
grundy
had
only
about
half
finished
her
confused
recital
of
facts
suspicions
and
theories
to
the
gravely
listening
squire
when
a
vigorous
was
distinctly
heard
coming
from
somewhere
near
at
hand
just
as
a
shout
broke
in
from
the
street
of
there
they
in
squire
room
look
at
them
before
the
squire
could
take
in
the
situation
his
excited
client
sprang
to
her
feet
rushed
out
of
the
office
across
the
hall
threw
open
the
door
into
the
opposite
room
and
there
behold
as
large
as
life
and
as
cross
as
three
gobblers
could
be
were
her
missing
turkeys
who
the
instant
the
door
was
opened
charged
straight
through
it
almost
upsetting
their
mistress
and
went
flapping
violently
downstairs
and
out
into
the
street
where
they
were
greeted
with
a
shout
of
laughter
from
the
surprised
spectators
it
would
be
impossible
with
either
pen
or
pencil
to
give
an
adequate
conception
of
the
old
countenance
as
she
returned
to
the
office
and
met
that
worthy
magistrate
just
rising
from
his
chair
surprise
suspicion
indignation
and
wrath
chased
one
another
swiftly
across
her
features
and
once
her
feelings
found
utterance
there
was
poured
upon
the
amazed
squire
such
a
torrent
of
reproach
and
contumely
that
he
was
fairly
stunned
into
silence
and
before
he
could
recover
himself
sufficiently
to
make
his
defence
his
accuser
with
a
scornful
swing
of
her
ample
skirts
that
was
simply
magnificent
flounced
out
of
the
office
while
he
sank
back
into
his
chair
the
very
picture
of
helpless
bewilderment
that
he
squire
hardgrit
the
incorruptible
guardian
of
the
rights
should
be
suspected
of
having
stolen
or
causing
to
have
stolen
for
him
the
turkeys
of
a
neighbour
whose
situation
as
a
lone
widow
was
such
as
to
make
the
crime
seem
particularly
any
person
should
for
one
moment
suspect
anything
so
abominable
and
not
only
suspect
it
but
charge
him
to
his
face
with
his
supposed
guilt
before
the
whole
village
for
the
squire
was
well
aware
that
shrill
utterances
had
been
audible
clear
across
the
street
it
was
awful
perfectly
awful
and
not
to
be
borne
for
a
moment
he
must
see
grundy
immediately
and
compel
her
to
listen
to
him
accordingly
away
he
posted
to
the
cottage
where
he
arrived
just
in
time
to
check
the
poor
dame
from
going
off
into
a
fit
of
hysterics
her
turkeys
being
once
more
safely
in
her
yard
and
her
anger
pretty
well
abated
grundy
was
quite
willing
to
listen
believingly
to
the
indignant
denials
and
graciously
accept
his
assurance
that
no
pains
would
be
spared
to
ferret
out
the
real
delinquents
the
former
harmony
was
restored
and
an
alliance
offensive
and
defensive
sealed
with
a
glass
of
gooseberry
wine
for
both
were
strongly
of
the
opinion
that
those
wicked
wretches
of
boys
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
mischief
thanks
to
those
same
boys
holding
their
tongues
however
neither
grundy
nor
the
squire
could
ever
get
hold
on
any
evidence
more
solid
than
their
own
suspicions
and
they
both
had
too
much
sense
to
take
any
action
upon
them
but
the
nocturnal
travels
of
the
turkeys
were
not
in
vain
for
their
mistress
realizing
that
the
boys
if
pressed
too
far
might
do
something
worse
next
time
thought
it
wise
to
mitigate
her
severity
toward
them
and
even
softened
to
the
extent
of
calling
a
lot
of
them
into
her
orchard
that
very
autumn
to
fill
their
pockets
with
the
windfalls
this
stroke
of
diplomacy
was
not
lost
upon
the
boys
who
reciprocated
after
their
own
fashion
and
thus
matters
went
smoothly
on
until
at
length
most
harmonious
relations
were
established
and
in
all
the
countryside
no
creatures
were
safer
from
the
mischief
than
gobblers
the
wrong
side
of
the
one
of
the
fur
commissioners
of
the
hudson
bay
company
at
winnipeg
was
entertaining
a
number
of
the
factors
and
other
officials
at
christmas
dinner
and
after
the
successive
courses
had
received
appreciative
attention
the
guests
settled
themselves
at
ease
about
the
table
to
enjoy
the
excellent
cigars
and
one
conversation
made
up
as
the
gathering
was
of
men
who
had
for
ten
twenty
thirty
years
or
longer
in
the
pursuance
of
their
vocation
experienced
most
moving
adventures
by
flood
and
field
good
stories
followed
fast
one
told
of
a
thrilling
trip
through
the
dangerous
rapids
of
the
portage
of
the
drowned
another
of
the
narrow
escape
from
meeting
death
at
the
hands
of
a
grizzly
among
the
of
the
rockies
while
a
third
held
the
attention
of
all
as
he
graphically
described
the
fearful
struggle
that
he
had
with
a
wounded
bull
bison
in
the
valley
of
the
bow
river
thus
the
went
around
until
it
reached
hugh
one
of
the
oldest
officials
in
the
active
service
who
in
response
to
a
unanimous
demand
spun
the
following
interesting
yarn
of
hunting
it
was
in
the
third
year
of
my
clerkship
and
they
had
sent
me
away
out
to
fort
george
right
in
the
heart
of
the
rockies
i
would
rather
have
stayed
on
the
plains
where
the
buffalo
were
in
plenty
but
not
asked
as
to
what
like
best
in
the
company
just
told
to
go
and
an
end
of
it
i
found
it
very
dull
at
fort
george
and
to
while
away
the
time
i
did
all
the
hunting
i
could
to
help
me
in
this
i
had
two
fine
dogs
of
whom
i
was
extremely
proud
they
were
collies
not
particularly
handsome
creatures
but
full
of
pluck
and
as
knowing
animals
as
ever
wagged
tails
having
had
pretty
good
luck
with
bear
and
other
game
to
be
found
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
fort
i
became
possessed
of
a
strong
desire
to
secure
the
head
of
one
of
those
rocky
mountain
sheep
which
have
their
home
high
up
among
the
peaks
and
are
as
difficult
animals
to
hunt
as
there
are
in
the
world
again
and
again
i
went
out
without
success
although
my
dogs
bruce
and
oscar
seemed
as
eager
to
get
sheep
as
i
was
myself
but
instead
of
becoming
disheartened
i
grew
all
the
more
determined
and
longed
for
the
winter
to
come
when
the
snow
by
covering
their
higher
pasturing
grounds
would
drive
the
sheep
lower
down
the
mountain
and
thus
make
them
more
getatable
the
winter
began
with
a
series
of
heavy
snowfalls
which
shut
us
all
up
in
the
fort
for
several
weeks
and
it
was
early
in
december
before
i
thought
it
safe
to
have
another
try
after
the
sheep
then
one
fine
bright
morning
i
started
off
feeling
very
hopeful
that
i
would
return
with
my
prize
the
dogs
of
course
went
with
me
but
i
had
no
other
companion
nobody
else
having
sufficient
sporting
ardour
to
share
in
the
risks
of
my
expedition
for
it
certainly
was
full
of
risks
and
had
i
been
older
and
wiser
i
would
never
have
undertaken
it
but
i
was
young
and
strong
and
full
of
spirit
and
my
eagerness
to
obtain
a
set
of
horns
had
become
a
bit
of
a
joke
against
me
with
the
fellows
so
that
i
was
not
in
the
mood
to
soberly
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
of
the
matter
thinking
it
possible
i
might
be
out
all
night
i
rolled
up
some
provisions
and
matches
in
my
thick
plaid
and
strapped
it
on
my
shoulders
with
hatchet
and
in
my
belt
a
full
at
my
side
snowshoes
on
feet
and
rifle
in
hand
i
set
out
amid
the
chaffing
of
my
up
into
the
mountains
i
climbed
keeping
a
keen
for
signs
of
the
game
i
was
seeking
while
bruce
and
oscar
ranged
right
and
left
so
that
we
covered
a
good
deal
of
ground
between
us
by
the
climbing
became
so
steep
and
difficult
that
i
had
to
take
off
my
and
strapped
them
on
my
back
they
were
no
longer
necessary
at
any
rate
for
the
snow
was
covered
with
a
crust
which
bore
me
up
admirably
and
made
easy
going
for
my
moccasined
feet
it
was
not
until
afternoon
that
the
first
sheep
were
sighted
and
much
to
my
delight
they
seemed
not
far
away
and
easy
to
get
at
there
were
five
in
the
flock
a
huge
ram
with
superb
the
thing
i
hankered
four
fine
ewes
which
however
had
nothing
to
fear
from
me
calling
the
dogs
to
heel
i
proceeded
to
stalk
the
unsuspecting
creatures
with
all
the
skill
i
possessed
it
proved
a
harder
job
than
i
thought
they
were
on
a
kind
of
ledge
several
hundred
feet
above
me
and
in
order
to
get
a
proper
shot
without
giving
them
warning
it
was
necessary
to
make
a
wide
circuit
so
as
to
reach
a
point
opposite
their
ledge
from
which
a
capital
chance
might
be
had
by
dint
of
great
exertion
however
i
reached
the
point
all
right
and
was
just
waiting
a
moment
to
catch
my
breath
before
taking
aim
at
the
ram
when
impatience
overcame
him
and
he
gave
a
sharp
bark
instantly
the
whole
live
animals
started
to
flee
i
threw
the
rifle
to
my
shoulder
and
pulled
the
trigger
it
was
nothing
better
than
a
yet
it
did
not
miss
for
with
the
report
the
ram
sprang
into
the
air
stumbled
as
he
came
down
and
then
dashed
off
again
leaving
behind
him
a
plain
trail
of
on
the
white
snow
with
an
exultant
shout
i
sent
the
dogs
forward
and
followed
as
fast
as
i
could
i
had
to
go
down
into
a
ravine
and
get
up
the
other
side
before
reaching
the
bloody
trail
forgetting
everything
else
in
my
wild
excitement
i
pressed
on
guided
by
my
sharp
barking
it
was
terribly
hard
work
and
i
had
many
a
slip
and
stumble
but
the
red
splashes
in
the
snow
grew
larger
the
further
i
went
bleeding
at
the
rate
he
was
the
ram
surely
could
not
keep
up
his
flight
for
any
great
distance
presently
i
came
to
a
place
that
at
any
other
time
would
have
brought
me
to
a
full
stop
a
ridge
of
hard
frozen
snow
stretched
between
two
rocky
ledges
on
the
one
side
it
reached
down
to
the
edge
of
a
precipice
which
then
fell
away
abruptly
into
an
unknown
depth
on
the
other
side
in
one
unbroken
sheet
it
sloped
down
full
five
hundred
feet
to
a
level
upon
which
the
snow
lay
in
great
drifts
the
ram
was
already
across
the
ridge
although
evidently
in
distress
and
the
dogs
were
hard
at
his
heel
barking
fiercely
for
they
knew
that
victory
was
not
far
off
throwing
all
considerations
of
prudence
to
the
winds
i
set
out
to
follow
them
so
narrow
was
the
ridge
that
i
could
not
stand
erect
but
had
to
sit
astride
it
and
push
myself
forward
by
using
both
hands
and
feet
i
never
glanced
below
me
lest
i
should
lose
my
head
and
at
length
almost
completely
exhausted
i
succeeded
in
making
the
other
side
here
awaiting
me
was
my
quarry
standing
at
bay
against
the
cliff
and
butting
off
the
dogs
that
were
springing
for
his
throat
it
was
some
minutes
before
my
nerves
were
sufficiently
steadied
for
me
to
use
my
rifle
then
one
shot
was
sufficient
with
a
convulsive
spring
the
noble
animal
scattered
the
dogs
and
fell
dead
at
my
feet
oh
but
what
a
proud
moment
for
me
the
horns
were
splendid
a
man
might
not
get
a
finer
pair
in
a
lifetime
with
the
utmost
care
i
detached
the
head
and
then
for
the
first
time
since
the
chase
began
sat
down
to
rest
i
was
so
tired
that
i
would
have
been
glad
to
camp
here
for
the
night
but
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
the
way
of
shelter
and
it
promised
to
be
bitterly
cold
and
windy
i
must
get
back
to
the
lower
level
before
darkness
came
on
securing
the
head
on
my
shoulders
where
i
must
say
it
felt
abominably
heavy
i
returned
to
the
ridge
not
until
then
did
i
realize
into
what
a
critical
position
my
reckless
ardour
had
brought
me
one
look
at
that
perilous
was
sufficient
to
assure
me
that
in
my
wearied
and
unnerved
condition
to
recross
it
was
a
feat
utterly
impracticable
my
clever
creatures
as
they
back
in
evident
dismay
although
i
sought
to
urge
them
forward
yet
for
me
to
remain
on
that
exposed
ledge
meant
death
by
freezing
before
morning
i
was
in
a
terrible
predicament
little
more
than
an
hour
of
daylight
remained
whatever
was
to
be
done
needed
to
be
done
right
away
while
i
stood
there
bewildered
and
irresolute
oscar
again
ventured
out
a
little
distance
on
the
ridge
but
becoming
frightened
tried
to
turn
back
in
so
doing
he
lost
his
footing
and
despite
desperate
efforts
to
regain
it
shot
swiftly
down
the
slope
that
ended
in
a
level
five
hundred
feet
below
with
keen
concern
i
watched
him
through
the
waning
light
rolling
helplessly
over
and
over
until
after
a
final
tumble
he
landed
in
a
great
drift
out
of
which
to
my
great
joy
he
emerged
the
next
moment
shook
himself
vigorously
and
sent
back
a
brisk
bark
as
though
to
say
along
not
so
bad
as
it
instantly
i
caught
the
idea
if
my
dog
made
the
descent
uninjured
why
could
not
i
great
as
the
risk
might
be
it
was
after
all
no
worse
than
staying
on
the
ledge
all
night
to
think
was
to
act
loosening
the
head
from
my
back
i
sent
it
down
after
oscar
it
sped
to
the
bottom
and
buried
itself
in
a
next
i
tied
my
rifle
hatchet
and
on
one
of
the
and
despatched
them
they
too
made
the
trip
all
right
and
vanished
in
the
snow
then
came
my
turn
rolling
up
the
plaid
i
lashed
it
on
the
remaining
and
committed
myself
to
this
extemporized
toboggan
what
followed
is
more
than
i
can
tell
so
steep
was
the
slope
that
i
seemed
to
drop
into
space
i
was
not
conscious
of
touching
anything
but
simply
of
being
shot
through
the
icy
air
blinded
by
particles
of
snow
and
choking
for
lack
of
breath
until
i
was
hurled
like
a
stone
from
a
catapult
into
a
mass
of
snow
and
lost
consciousness
when
i
came
to
myself
bruce
and
oscar
were
both
beside
me
licking
my
face
with
affectionate
anxiety
at
first
i
could
not
move
and
my
whole
body
was
so
full
of
pain
that
i
feared
i
had
been
seriously
injured
but
after
lying
still
awhile
i
made
shift
to
get
upon
my
feet
and
to
my
vast
relief
found
myself
none
the
worse
of
my
wild
descent
save
for
a
scratched
face
and
a
severe
shaking
my
next
thought
was
for
the
horns
i
had
no
difficulty
in
extricating
them
or
the
rifle
from
their
snowy
bed
and
found
both
were
uninjured
strapping
them
once
more
on
my
shoulders
and
adjusting
my
i
set
off
down
the
ravine
to
get
back
to
the
fort
that
evening
was
of
course
out
of
the
question
but
i
hoped
to
find
some
cavity
in
the
cliff
where
i
could
spend
the
night
safely
just
before
dark
i
discovered
a
snug
little
place
perfectly
protected
from
the
wind
and
there
with
my
plaid
wrapped
tight
around
me
and
my
dogs
curled
up
close
against
me
i
put
in
quite
a
comfortable
night
as
soon
as
the
day
broke
i
started
for
the
fort
and
reached
it
by
noon
half
starved
and
very
tired
but
as
proud
of
my
trophy
as
david
was
of
head
a
hearty
round
of
applause
followed
the
conclusion
of
the
old
story
and
by
general
consent
it
was
voted
the
best
told
during
the
evening
the

the
two
features
of
nature
in
which
her

nowhere
round

the
recital
of
such
an
experience
as
the
foremost
and
noblest
of
all
the
pioneers
of
these
north
american
forests
had
one
eventful
autumn
nearly
three
centuries
ago
champlain
had
caught
sight
of
a
bird
and
left
his
party
to
go
in
pursuit
flitting
from
tree
to
tree
the
bird
lured
him
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
forest
then
took
wing
and
vanished
on
essaying
to
retrace
his
steps
champlain
found
himself
at
a
loss
whither
should
he
turn
the
day
was
clouded
and
he
had
left
his
compass
in
camp
the
forest
closed
around
him
trees
mingled
with
trees
in
limitless
confusion
bewildered
and
lost
he
wandered
all
day
and
at
night
slept
fasting
at
the
foot
of
a
great
tree
awaking
chilled
and
faint
he
walked
until
afternoon
then
happily
found
a
pond
upon
whose
bosom
were
some
of
which
he
shot
and
for
the
first
time
broke
his
fast
kindling
a
fire
he
prepared
his
supper
and
lay
down
to
sleep
in
a
drenching
rain
another
day
of
blind
and
weary
wandering
succeeded
and
another
night
of
exhaustion
he
found
paths
in
the
wilderness
but
they
had
not
been
made
by
human
feet
after
a
time
the
tinkling
of
a
brook
touched
his
ear
and
he
determined
to
follow
its
course
in
the
hope
that
it
would
lead
him
to
the
river
where
his
party
was
encamped
with
toilsome
steps
he
traced
the
infant
stream
now
lost
beneath
the
decaying
masses
of
fallen
trunks
or
the
impervious
intricacies
of
matted
windfalls
now
stealing
through
swampy
thickets
or
gurgling
in
the
shade
of
rocks
till
it
entered
at
length
not
into
the
river
but
into
a
small
lake
circling
around
the
brink
he
found
the
point
where
gliding
among
clammy
roots
of
alders
the
brook
ran
out
and
resumed
its
course
pressing
persistently
forward
he
at
length
forced
his
way
out
of
the
entanglement
of
underbrush
into
an
open
meadow
and
there
before
him
rolled
the
river
broad
and
turbulent
its
bank
marked
with
the
by
which
the
indians
passed
the
neighbouring
rapids
the
good
god
be
praised
he
had
found
the
clue
he
sought
inexpressibly
relieved
he
hastened
along
the
and
in
a
few
hours
more
was
being
joyfully
welcomed
by
his
companions
who
had
been
anxiously
searching
for
him
from
that
day
forth
we
are
told
his
host
durantal
would
never
suffer
him
to
go
into
the
forest
alone
although
the
de
has
long
since
made
his
exit
there
still
remains
in
canada
a
class
of
men
who
have
somewhat
in
common
with
him
these
are
or
whose
business
it
is
to
seek
for
limits
that
will
pay
handsome
profits
it
is
boards
not
beavers
they
have
upon
their
minds
they
are
often
indians
or
and
the
skill
of
these
surveyors
is
sometimes
very
remarkable
they
will
explore
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
and
report
upon
the
kind
and
value
of
its
timber
the
situation
and
capability
of
its
streams
for
floating
out
the
logs
and
the
facilities
for
hauling
and
transportation
they
will
even
map
out
the
surface
of
the
country
showing
the
position
of
its
streams
and
lakes
its
groves
of
timber
and
its
mountainous
or
level
appearance
with
a
skill
and
accuracy
bewildering
to
ordinary
mortals
in
whose
eyes
the
whole
district
would
be
one
great
confused
wilderness
no
more
interesting
experience
in
woodcraft
could
be
had
than
a
scouting
excursion
in
such
company
the
trackless
forest
has
no
terrors
no
mysteries
for
them
to
them
nature
opens
her
heart
and
tells
all
her
secrets
in
lightest
marching
order
each
entire
equipment
being
carried
in
a
upheld
by
a
around
the
forehead
they
plunge
into
the
wilderness
with
unerring
instinct
they
pursue
their
way
now
following
the
course
of
some
winding
stream
now
circling
a
tiny
lake
lying
in
a
verdurous
setting
now
scrambling
amongst
cliffs
where
to
paraphrase
parkman
seeing
but
unseen
the
crouched
eyes
them
from
the
thicket
now
threading
a
maze
of
rocks
which
the
white
cedar
and
the
spruce
clasp
with
roots
then
diving
into
leafy
depths
where
the
rears
its
green
masses
the
beech
its
glistening
leaves
and
clear
smooth
stem
while
behind
stiff
and
sombre
stands
the
balsam
fir
and
the
white
pine
towers
proudly
over
all
when
night
falls
they
make
their
simple
bivouac
and
their
roaring
like
a
wand
strangely
transforms
the
scene
as
the
flame
casts
its
keen
red
light
around
wild
forms
stand
forth
against
the
outer
oak
a
giant
in
rusty
mail
the
mighty
pyramid
of
the
pine
the
wan
and
ghastly
birch
looking
like
a
spectre
in
the
darkness
the
campers
gather
close
around
the
ruddy
flame
made
welcome
by
the
cool
breath
of
approaching
autumn
and
after
the
broiled
trout
or
roast
duck
have
disappeared
and
an
incense
offering
of
fragrant
smoke
ascended
from
their
pipes
they
curl
up
in
their
blankets
and
sleep
as
only
those
who
live
such
a
life
can
sleep
serenely
oblivious
of
the
harsh
shriek
of
the
owl
the
mournful
howl
of
the
wolf
or
the
soft
footfall
of
some
prowling
beast
that
breaks
in
upon
the
breathless
stillness
splendid
as
our
forests
are
at
midsummer
when
the
delighted
eye
roams
unweariedly
over
their
billowy
expanses
of
sumptuous
verdure
it
is
in
the
autumn
time
that
they
reach
their
rarest
beauty
then
for
a
brief
space
before
they
strip
themselves
of
their
foliage
to
stand
bare
and
shivering
through
the
long
cold
winter
they
change
their
garb
of
green
into
a
myriad
of
hues
of
gold
and
flame
a
keen
frosty
night
following
upon
the
decline
of
summer
heat
and
lo
as
though
some
mighty
magician
had
been
at
work
a
marvellous
transformation
awaits
our
admiration
where
yesterday
a
single
colour
in
various
tints
prevailed
we
behold
every
possible
shade
of
brilliant
scarlet
tender
violet
sombre
brown
vivid
crimson
and
glittering
yellow
the
beech
the
birch
the
oak
and
above
all
the
maple
have
burst
forth
into
one
harmonious
and
entrancing
chorus
of
swan
song
of
the
dying
stern
straight
fir
alone
maintaining
its
eternal
green
as
if
it
said
behold
in
me
the
symbol
of
steadfastness
verily
the
wide
world
round
a
more
splendid
and
enchanting
silvan
panorama
can
not
be
found
and
wreckers
of
anticosti
right
in
the
mouth
of
the
great
lawrence
which
without
exaggeration
has
been
called
the
noblest
the
purest
the
most
enchanting
river
on
all
beautiful
earth
lies
a
long
narrow
island
that
might
with
equal
propriety
be
called
the
dreariest
most
inhospitable
and
most
destructive
island
on
the
earth
for
it
is
doubtful
if
any
other
spot
of
corresponding
size
has
caused
so
many
shipwrecks
and
so
much
human
suffering
in
ten
years
according
to
official
records
there
have
been
as
many
as
one
hundred
and
six
wrecks
including
seven
steamships
and
or
barques
having
on
board
no
less
than
three
thousand
precious
souls
and
cargoes
worth
millions
of
pounds
years
ago
before
the
canadian
government
erected
lighthouses
and
established
relief
stations
the
wrecks
were
more
numerous
still
and
were
rarely
unattended
with
loss
of
life
but
times
are
better
now
and
when
a
wreck
occurs
unless
it
be
in
one
of
those
terrible
winter
storms
that
seem
to
make
this
isle
their
centre
the
crew
generally
manage
to
make
the
land
in
safety
where
they
are
well
cared
for
by
the
government
officials
far
different
was
it
in
when
the
french
stranded
upon
a
cruel
ledge
of
rocks
hardly
a
mile
off
shore
about
eight
leagues
from
the
southern
point
of
anticosti
it
was
in
the
month
of
november
just
as
winter
which
could
nowhere
have
been
more
dreadful
than
on
that
bleak
barren
shelterless
island
was
fast
closing
in
in
their
mad
haste
to
reach
the
the
waves
were
breaking
high
over
the
crew
took
little
food
with
them
although
gallant
captain
de
freneuse
did
not
forget
to
take
the
colours
when
in
the
gray
grim
morning
they
came
to
reckon
up
they
found
to
their
dismay
that
with
six
months
of
hopeless
captivity
before
them
they
had
barely
enough
food
for
forty
days
allowing
the
scantiest
of
daily
rations
to
each
of
the
men
who
had
survived
the
shipwreck
the
sequel
as
related
with
simple
graphic
pathos
by
father
crespel
one
of
the
few
who
ultimately
emerged
from
the
terrible
ordeal
constitutes
as
grand
a
record
of
human
courage
and
endurance
and
as
harrowing
a
history
of
human
suffering
as
ever
has
been
told
the
poor
castaways
had
nothing
but
a
little
canvas
to
shelter
them
from
the
keen
biting
blasts
fever
presently
broke
out
amongst
them
then
half
of
them
set
forth
in
two
small
boats
to
coast
around
that
merciless
shore
for
forty
leagues
after
which
they
made
a
hazardous
dash
across
twelve
leagues
of
open
sea
to
mingan
where
french
fishermen
were
known
to
winter
the
was
swamped
after
they
had
been
five
days
out
and
its
thirteen
occupants
were
thus
spared
further
misery
at
last
the
ice
setting
in
made
the
progress
of
the
other
boat
impossible
and
they
had
no
alternative
but
to
go
into
winter
quarters
and
wait
for
the
tardy
spring
with
two
pounds
of
damp
mouldy
flour
and
two
pounds
of
unsavoury
per
day
these
seventeen
men
housed
in
rude
huts
of
spruce
boughs
prepared
to
endure
the
long
agony
of
winter
once
a
week
a
spoonful
of
peas
was
served
out
to
each
man
which
constituted
such
a
treat
that
as
father
crespel
naively
puts
it
on
those
days
we
had
our
best
meal
hunger
cold
and
disease
carried
off
one
by
one
as
the
months
dragged
themselves
along
until
at
length
only
three
still
lived
when
a
band
of
indians
came
just
in
time
to
save
this
remnant
from
perishing
all
this
and
more
is
told
by
heroic
father
crespel
with
a
quaint
simplicity
a
minuteness
of
detail
and
a
perfect
submission
to
the
divine
will
that
renders
his
recital
extremely
touching
not
less
saddening
is
the
story
of
the
stout
brig
which
in
went
to
pieces
off
the
east
end
of
the
island
also
in
the
month
of
november
many
of
the
crew
escaped
to
land
but
with
little
more
than
the
clothing
they
wore
illustration
hunger
cold
and
disease
carried
off
one
by
one
until
only
three
still
lived
winter
soon
closed
in
upon
them
no
succour
came
their
provisions
gave
out
and
what
followed
may
be
judged
from
the
awful
sight
that
met
the
eyes
of
some
government
officials
when
the
following
spring
they
stumbled
across
a
rude
hut
strewn
with
human
skeletons
and
in
the
pot
that
hung
over
the
ashes
some
bones
that
were
not
those
of
an
animal
those
dreadful
days
are
happily
past
and
gone
few
lives
are
lost
on
anticosti
now
four
fine
lighthouses
send
their
cheering
rays
across
the
anxious
path
and
sound
friendly
notes
of
warning
when
the
frequent
fogs
dim
the
lights
and
at
different
points
are
ready
to
speed
at
once
the
news
of
disaster
to
the
mainland
by
means
of
the
submarine
cable
where
wrecks
are
plentiful
and
the
controlling
hand
of
the
law
is
absent
wreckers
are
sure
to
be
plentiful
also
anticosti
has
been
no
exception
to
this
rule
the
island
has
had
its
share
of
those
who
did
not
hesitate
to
pursue
this
nefarious
business
from
the
earliest
times
the
place
has
held
out
attractions
to
the
fisherman
and
the
hunter
the
cod
halibut
herring
and
other
fish
that
it
pays
to
catch
abound
along
the
coast
huge
lobsters
play
among
the
and
very
good
salmon
and
trout
may
be
caught
in
some
of
the
streams
while
seals
spend
the
greater
part
of
the
year
sporting
in
the
waves
or
basking
on
the
shore
then
away
inland
there
are
or
used
to
be
bears
otters
martens
and
foxes
to
be
had
for
the
shooting
or
trapping
coming
first
to
fish
and
hunt
the
fishermen
and
hunters
in
many
cases
stayed
to
play
the
part
of
wreckers
there
was
a
good
deal
more
money
to
be
made
out
of
the
flotsam
and
jetsam
that
the
storms
sent
their
way
than
out
of
fish
or
fur
and
they
made
the
most
of
their
opportunities
one
thing
however
must
be
said
in
their
behalf
they
have
never
been
accused
of
luring
vessels
to
destruction
by
false
lights
or
of
confirming
their
title
to
the
goods
cast
up
by
the
sea
by
acting
upon
the
principle
that
dead
men
are
not
competent
witnesses
in
court
and
by
despatching
any
of
the
shipwrecked
who
might
have
survived
the
disaster
on
the
contrary
more
than
one
unfortunate
crew
have
owed
the
preservation
of
their
lives
to
these
very
wreckers
the
most
renowned
of
them
man
of
whom
it
might
in
truth
be
said
that
there
was
not
a
lawrence
pilot
or
a
canadian
sailor
who
knew
him
not
by
reputation
or
a
parish
between
quebec
and
gaspé
where
marvellous
tales
were
not
told
about
him
around
the
evening
louis
olivier
gamache
in
these
stories
he
figured
as
the
of
a
pirate
half
ogre
half
who
enjoyed
the
friendship
and
special
protection
of
a
familiar
demon
the
learned
and
loquacious
abbé
ferland
in
his
dainty
little
volume
of
opuscules
which
i
hold
in
my
hand
tells
us
about
this
wonderful
gamache
that
according
to
popular
rumour
he
had
been
seen
to
stand
upright
upon
the
thwarts
of
his
sloop
and
command
the
demon
to
bring
him
a
capful
of
wind
instantly
his
sails
were
filled
though
the
sea
around
him
was
in
a
glassy
calm
and
away
he
went
while
all
about
him
were
vessels
powerless
to
move
during
a
trip
to
rimouski
he
gave
a
grand
supper
to
the
devil
not
to
a
devil
of
the
second
class
but
to
the
veritable
old
gentleman
himself
aided
by
invisible
assistants
he
had
massacred
whole
crews
and
appropriated
to
himself
the
rich
cargoes
of
their
vessels
when
hotly
pursued
by
a
government
boat
sent
to
capture
him
and
just
about
being
overtaken
both
sloop
and
gamache
suddenly
disappeared
leaving
nothing
behind
but
a
blue
flame
that
went
dancing
over
the
waves
in
mocking
defiance
of
the
disappointed
minions
of
the
law
upon
such
thrilling
legends
as
these
was
founded
the
reputation
of
the
wizard
of
anticosti
and
so
generally
were
they
believed
that
the
genial
abbé
assures
us
that
the
majority
of
the
mariners
in
the
gulf
would
rather
have
attempted
to
scale
the
citadel
of
quebec
than
to
approach
by
night
the
bay
where
gamache
was
known
to
have
his
stronghold
we
can
put
plenty
of
confidence
in
the
abbé
for
in
the
year
he
had
the
courage
to
pay
the
wizard
a
visit
and
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
not
room
to
give
the
full
particulars
of
that
visit
as
they
are
brightly
presented
by
this
writer
he
found
the
gamache
to
be
a
tall
erect
and
vigorous
old
man
with
hair
but
piercing
eyes
who
came
forward
to
meet
his
visitors
with
an
easy
dignified
bearing
that
betrayed
no
concern
or
troubled
conscience
his
house
appeared
to
be
a
perfect
arsenal
of
deadly
weapons
no
fewer
than
a
dozen
guns
many
of
them
grimly
adorned
the
walls
of
the
first
room
they
entered
and
every
other
room
up
to
the
very
garret
had
at
least
two
or
three
more
loaded
and
capped
they
hung
upon
racks
surrounded
by
swords
sabres
daggers
bayonets
and
pistols
in
most
imposing
profusion
the
house
itself
was
something
of
a
fortress
every
possible
precaution
had
been
taken
to
prevent
persons
entering
it
without
the
permission
of
its
master
all
the
doors
and
windows
were
strongly
barred
and
shuttered
and
so
complete
were
the
defences
that
one
man
inside
might
have
defied
twenty
outside
in
the
sheds
arranged
in
the
most
orderly
manner
were
long
rows
of
barrels
bales
casks
and
other
gifts
of
the
sea
such
was
the
den
of
the
dreaded
wrecker
a
man
not
one
tithe
so
bad
as
wild
rumour
made
him
but
who
nevertheless
took
pains
to
intensify
the
public
feeling
about
himself
in
order
that
he
might
be
the
more
undisturbed
in
the
solitude
he
had
chosen
for
himself
in
that
strange
wild
place
he
had
not
always
been
alone
either
twice
had
a
woman
been
found
willing
to
brave
the
rigours
of
his
life
for
love
of
him
and
in
both
cases
they
had
succumbed
to
the
terrible
loneliness
and
desolation
his
second
wife
died
suddenly
while
he
was
off
on
a
in
and
he
returned
after
a
absence
to
find
her
frozen
form
clasping
to
its
icy
breast
the
bodies
of
their
two
little
children
the
one
five
and
the
other
six
years
old
that
is
how
they
will
find
me
some
day
each
one
in
their
turn
ah
she
is
dead
we
can
only
bury
her
that
was
all
the
strange
taciturn
man
said
to
his
companion
a
hunter
who
had
been
with
him
and
yet
he
had
always
shown
his
wife
the
greatest
kindness
and
affection
it
was
not
that
he
was
heartless
but
that
he
would
rather
have
died
than
reveal
the
depth
of
his
feeling
he
amused
the
abbé
very
much
by
relating
the
various
devices
to
which
he
had
resorted
in
order
to
heighten
his
reputation
for
diabolic
associations
he
would
go
to
a
country
inn
for
instance
order
a
supper
for
two
to
be
served
in
a
private
room
stating
that
he
expected
a
gentleman
in
sable
garments
to
share
it
with
him
when
the
supper
was
ready
he
would
then
lock
himself
up
in
the
room
polish
the
supper
off
unaided
and
summon
the
astonished
landlady
to
clear
the
remains
away
as
he
and
his
friend
had
supped
and
were
satisfied
he
would
further
increase
their
mystification
by
sundry
rappings
and
inexplicable
openings
and
shuttings
of
doors
he
could
also
employ
more
sinister
means
of
protecting
himself
when
necessary
one
day
when
he
was
quite
alone
a
canoe
glided
into
the
bay
and
presently
a
gigantic
montagnais
indian
stepped
ashore
armed
to
the
teeth
and
advanced
with
a
firm
step
towards
the
house
he
was
evidently
crazed
with
and
gamache
felt
in
no
mood
to
try
a
tussle
with
so
brawny
an
opponent
standing
in
the
doorway
with
a
rifle
in
his
hands
he
called
out
in
his
sternest
tones
stop
i
forbid
you
to
advance
the
intruder
took
not
the
slightest
notice
of
him
take
another
step
and
i
fire
shouted
gamache
the
step
was
taken
but
before
it
could
be
repeated
the
rifle
spoke
and
the
indian
fell
his
smashed
with
the
bullet
in
an
instant
gamache
was
beside
the
wounded
man
removing
his
weapons
he
lifted
him
to
his
shoulder
and
bore
him
tenderly
to
the
house
and
there
nursed
him
until
he
was
completely
recovered
then
filling
his
canoe
with
provisions
he
sent
him
back
to
his
tribe
with
a
warning
never
to
intrude
upon
gamache
again
unless
he
wanted
a
bullet
through
his
head
instead
of
his
thigh
in
louis
olivier
gamache
died
like
his
poor
wife
alone
and
unattended
for
weeks
no
one
had
visited
his
abode
and
when
at
last
some
seafarers
chanced
that
way
they
found
only
the
corpse
of
the
once
dreaded
wizard
whose
supposed
league
with
evil
spirits
did
not
avail
to
save
him
from
fulfilling
his
own
prophecy
the
wrecks
continue
at
anticosti
not
long
ago
the
shattered
skeletons
of
four
fine
ocean
steamers
might
have
been
seen
upon
its
fatal
shores
but
with
gamache
the
reign
of
the
wreckers
ended
never
to
return
lumber
camp
there
is
no
summer
in
a
canadian
lumber
camp
that
is
to
say
there
is
nobody
in
the
camp
in
summer
which
amounts
to
the
same
thing
the
season
of
activity
in
the
camps
or
the
shanties
as
they
are
generally
called
extends
from
late
september
to
early
april
and
all
summer
long
they
are
left
to
the
care
of
birds
that
chirp
and
squirrels
that
chatter
on
the
roof
in
the
month
of
september
the
canadian
lumberman
joins
the
gang
of
sturdy
active
men
who
are
bound
for
the
shanties
where
a
winter
of
hard
work
awaits
them
for
him
the
forests
exist
only
to
be
remorselessly
cut
down
but
though
he
may
never
stop
to
think
about
it
his
is
a
very
romantic
and
fascinating
occupation
september
is
one
of
the
loveliest
months
in
the
canadian
calendar
the
days
are
still
long
and
sunny
the
heat
of
summer
has
passed
away
and
the
chill
of
autumn
not
yet
come
one
cloudless
day
follows
another
and
nature
seems
to
be
doing
her
best
to
make
existence
a
delight
this
is
the
time
when
the
shantymen
gather
into
gangs
and
by
rail
or
steamer
journey
northward
until
they
pass
the
limits
of
settlement
then
taking
to
mare
they
make
their
way
into
the
depths
of
the
forest
let
us
follow
a
gang
that
is
going
upon
a
limit
still
untouched
by
the
axe
far
up
the
black
river
a
tributary
of
the
ottawa
a
hundred
miles
or
more
from
the
nearest
village
this
gang
consists
of
about
forty
men
including
the
foremen
clerk
carpenter
cook
and
all
active
sturdy
and
fellows
most
of
them
are
as
the
local
term
english
scotch
and
irish
are
found
among
them
too
and
quite
often
swarthy
men
whose
features
tell
plainly
of
indian
blood
scouts
have
previously
selected
the
best
site
for
the
camp
it
is
usually
in
the
midst
of
the
bunch
of
timber
to
be
cut
so
that
little
time
may
be
lost
in
going
and
coming
on
arriving
the
first
thing
done
by
the
gang
is
to
build
the
shanty
which
is
to
be
its
home
during
the
long
cold
winter
this
edifice
makes
no
pretence
to
architectural
beauty
but
nothing
could
be
better
adapted
to
its
purpose
it
is
an
illustration
of
simplicity
and
strength
combined
with
all
hands
helping
heartily
a
shanty
forty
feet
long
by
feet
wide
can
be
put
up
in
five
days
meantime
the
builders
live
in
tents
this
is
the
way
they
go
about
it
of
all
a
number
of
trees
are
cut
down
the
trunks
cleared
of
all
their
branches
are
sawed
into
proper
lengths
and
then
laid
one
upon
another
until
an
enclosure
with
walls
eight
feet
high
is
obtained
upon
the
top
of
these
walls
strong
girders
are
stretched
which
are
supported
in
the
centre
by
four
great
pillars
called
then
comes
the
roof
a
canadian
shanty
roof
is
neither
tiled
nor
shingled
but
scooped
what
is
a
scoop
it
is
a
piece
of
timber
something
like
a
very
long
railway
tie
one
side
of
which
is
hollowed
out
clear
to
the
ends
place
two
of
these
side
by
side
with
the
concave
sides
upward
and
then
lay
another
on
top
of
them
concave
side
down
so
that
the
edges
overlap
and
fall
into
the
troughs
and
you
have
a
roof
that
will
defy
the
heaviest
rains
or
wildest
that
canada
can
produce
a
floor
of
timbers
having
been
laid
and
a
door
cut
it
only
remains
to
construct
the
camboose
or
fireplace
and
the
bunks
and
the
shanty
is
complete
provided
of
course
every
cranny
in
the
walls
has
been
chinked
with
moss
and
mud
and
a
bank
of
earth
thrown
up
all
around
the
outside
to
make
sure
that
no
draughts
can
sneak
in
when
the
mercury
is
far
below
zero
the
camboose
is
quite
an
important
affair
and
occupies
the
place
of
honour
in
the
centre
of
the
room
between
the
four
massive
its
construction
is
as
rude
and
simple
as
that
of
the
rest
of
the
shanty
a
bank
of
sand
about
two
feet
deep
and
six
feet
square
makes
the
hearth
over
it
hang
two
wooden
cranes
that
hold
the
capacious
kettles
which
are
always
full
of
the
or
fat
salt
pork
that
constitute
the
chief
items
in
the
bill
of
fare
a
mighty
fire
roars
and
crackles
unceasingly
upon
the
hearth
its
smoke
escaping
through
a
square
hole
in
the
hole
so
big
that
one
may
lie
in
the
bunks
and
study
the
stars
this
rude
chimney
secures
the
best
of
ventilation
to
the
shantymen
the
bunks
which
are
simply
sloping
platforms
about
seven
feet
in
length
running
around
three
sides
of
the
room
offer
the
sweet
allurement
of
the
soft
side
of
a
plank
to
the
tired
toilers
at
the
close
of
the
day
such
is
a
shanty
of
the
good
sort
in
later
days
such
refinements
of
civilization
as
windows
stoves
and
tables
have
been
added
by
progressive
lumbermen
but
there
are
still
scores
of
shanties
to
which
the
above
description
applies
the
shantymen
are
now
ready
to
begin
operations
against
the
great
trees
that
have
been
standing
all
about
silent
unconscious
spectators
of
the
undertaking
the
forty
men
are
divided
according
to
the
nature
of
their
work
the
clerk
cook
and
are
the
the
others
according
to
their
various
abilities
are
choppers
teamsters
sawyers
and
chainers
the
only
duty
requiring
explanation
is
that
of
it
is
usually
performed
by
the
youngest
member
of
the
gang
although
sometimes
it
falls
to
the
lot
of
a
man
well
up
in
years
the
is
the
assistant
and
general
utility
worker
of
the
shanty
he
has
to
chop
the
firewood
draw
the
water
wash
the
dishes
and
perform
a
multitude
of
such
odd
jobs
in
return
for
which
he
is
apt
to
get
little
thanks
and
much
abuse
the
choppers
have
the
most
important
and
interesting
part
of
the
work
they
always
work
in
pairs
and
go
out
against
the
trees
armed
with
a
keen
axe
apiece
and
a
between
them
having
selected
their
a
splendid
pine
towering
more
than
a
hundred
feet
in
the
take
up
their
position
at
each
side
soon
the
strokes
of
the
axes
ring
out
in
quick
succession
for
some
time
the
yellow
chips
fly
fast
and
presently
a
shiver
runs
through
the
mighty
frame
one
of
the
choppers
cries
warningly
to
the
other
who
hastens
to
get
out
of
the
way
a
few
more
strokes
are
given
with
nice
skill
then
comes
a
rending
crack
whose
meaning
can
not
be
mistaken
and
the
stately
tree
after
quivering
a
moment
as
though
uncertain
which
way
to
fall
crashes
headlong
to
the
ground
making
a
wide
swath
through
the
smaller
trees
standing
near
a
good
chopper
can
lay
his
tree
almost
exactly
where
he
likes
and
yet
somehow
accidents
are
of
frequent
occurrence
every
winter
additions
are
made
to
the
long
list
of
men
whom
the
trees
have
succeeded
in
involving
in
their
own
ruin
a
gust
of
wind
the
proximity
of
another
tree
or
some
such
influence
may
cause
the
falling
trunk
to
swerve
and
fall
with
fatal
force
upon
the
unwary
chopper
the
tree
felled
the
next
proceeding
is
to
strip
it
of
its
branches
and
saw
it
up
into
as
many
logs
as
can
be
got
from
it
two
three
four
or
even
as
many
as
five
logs
may
be
obtained
from
a
single
length
of
each
being
thirteen
and
a
half
feet
or
sixteen
and
a
half
according
to
the
quality
the
odd
is
allowed
for
the
brooming
of
the
ends
as
the
logs
make
their
rough
journey
down
the
streams
to
the
mills
illustration
lumbering
eighty
logs
felled
trimmed
and
sawed
is
quite
an
ordinary
work
for
one
pair
of
choppers
and
when
the
choppers
have
been
striving
is
each
pair
trying
its
best
to
outdo
the
hundred
logs
have
been
turned
in
by
a
single
pair
as
the
splendid
result
of
a
work
the
logs
are
at
first
piled
up
on
which
are
simply
two
placed
a
little
distance
apart
later
on
when
the
have
done
their
part
the
teamsters
bear
them
off
to
the
bank
of
the
stream
or
out
upon
the
ice
of
the
lake
where
they
wait
the
coming
of
spring
to
begin
their
journey
by
water
to
the
mills
the
shantyman
leads
a
free
hearty
healthy
life
from
dawn
until
dark
he
works
in
the
open
air
exercising
lungs
and
muscles
when
the
autumn
rains
are
over
and
the
snow
has
come
to
stay
he
breathes
for
four
months
the
clear
cold
bracing
air
of
the
canadian
winter
fragrant
with
the
scent
of
pine
and
cedar
no
matter
how
fond
of
drink
he
may
be
not
one
drop
of
liquor
can
he
have
although
he
may
and
does

and
deep

the
cup
that
cheers
his

possesses
at

two
sterling
merits
it
is
substantial
in
quality
and
unlimited
in
quantity
he
enjoys
it
most
when
the
work
is
over
and
no
less
weary
than
hungry
he
trudges
home
to
the
shanty
there
he
finds
the
warm
welcome
of
a
steaming
supper
awaiting
him
drawn
up
about
the
blazing
fire
he
sees
a
pot
of
excellent
a
boiler
of
strong
tea
a
big
pan
full
of
fat
pork
fried
and
floating
in

picking
up
two
of

he
fills

and
the

helping
himself
to
a
generous
slice
of
the
hot
bread
he
makes
use
of
it
as
a
plate
for
a
slice
of
the
pork
then
he
retires
to
the
edge
of
his
bunk
and
with
the
aid
of
his
discusses
this
solid
if
not
varied
repast
there
is
not
much
change
in
the
bill
of
fare
all
winter
occasionally
perhaps
if
the
roads
permit
fresh
beef
on
foot
will
be
sent
up
from
the
depot
and
the
lumbermen
may
enjoy
the
luxury
of
steaks
and
roasts
quite
often
too
a
bit
of
game
will
fall
in
their
way
while
they
are
working
in
the
woods
great
is
the
rejoicing
when
françois
or
alec
succeeds
in
bringing
down
a
fat
deer
too
is
not
unknown
the
bear
is
trapped
in
a
dead
fall
or
small
hut
above
the
door
of
which
a
heavy
log
is
hung
in
such
a
way
that
it
drops
with
crushing
force
upon
the
bear
pushing
in
to
get
at
the
bait
sometimes
the
shantymen
do
a
little
trapping
on
their
own
account
one
of
them
who
wished
to
obtain
a
fine
paid
dearly
for
his
prize
he
had
set
his
steel
spring
trap
and
returning
after
an
interval
found
that
it
had
disappeared
the
marks
in
the
snow
made
tracking
easy
and
hurrying
along
he
presently
reached
a
great
log
over
which
the
trap
had
evidently
been
dragged
his
haste
made
him
careless
and
springing
across
the
broad
trunk
without
stopping
to
reconnoitre
he
threw
himself
right
into
the
arms
of
the
bear
the
animal
weary
of
dragging
the
heavy
trap
was
resting
on
the
other
side
the
hunted
creature
was
furious
with
pain
the
only
weapon
was
his
which
he
drew
and
stabbed
the
bear
again
and
again
in
the
breast
but
stab
as
he
might
he
could
not
loose
the
fatal
grasp
next
day
his
comrades
anxiously
following
up
his
trail
found
him
dead
with
the
dead
paws
still
holding
him
fast
the
recess
comes
when
the
evening
meal
has
been
despatched
he
has
an
hour
or
more
before
it
is
pipes
all
round
and
song
and
joke
and
story
win
generous
applause
from
the
not
audience
the
are
especially
fond
of
singing
they
have
many
songs
some
of
which
like
à
la
claire
fontaine
and
en
roulant
ma
boule
are
full
of
spirit
and
beauty
if
françois
or
alec
has
remembered
to
bring
his
fiddle
with
he
seldom
forgets
singing
is
sure
to
be
followed
by
dancing
as
the
evening
goes
on
bedtime
comes
early
in
the
shanty
by
nine
at
the
latest
all
have
turned
in
the
process
of
going
to
bed
consists
simply
in
taking
off
coat
and
boots
and
rolling
up
snugly
in
a
couple
of
thick
blankets
many
a
millionaire
would
gladly
give
one
of
his
millions
for
the
ability
to
sleep
as
soundly
and
restfully
in
his
soft
bed
as
does
the
shantyman
upon
his
pine
boards
in
the
dusk
of
early
morning
the
loud
voice
is
heard
calling
to
the
men
turn
out
now
and
get
your
breakfast
the
lumberman
has
been
asleep
ten
good
hours
but
he
feels
as
if
he
had
just
lain
down
sunday
is
the
day
the
shantyman
likes
best
no
work
is
done
upon
that
day
he
can
spend
the
time
as
he
pleases
generally
he
is
content
to
lounge
about
smoking
and
enjoying
the
luxury
of
doing
nothing
a
religious
service
is
so
rare
a
treat
that
when
there
is
one
all
attend
it
without
reference
to
their
creed
thus
the
long
winter
slips
by
the
logs
accumulate
upon
the
river
bank
or
out
upon
the
icy
lake
when
the
warm
days
of
spring
come
the
labours
are
at
an
end
so
far
as
the
shanty
is
concerned
the
great
spring
drive
begins
the
logs
start
upon
their
journey
southward
and
the
shantyman
becomes
a
armed
with
or
he
hurries
his
awkward
squads
of
logs
down
stream
as
a
shepherd
drives
his
flock
to
market
this
is
often
a
very
exciting
and
dangerous
occupation
the
canadian
rivers
abound
in
falls
and
rapids
past
which
the
flocks
of
have
to
be
guided
skilfully
many
a
time
the
life
is
in
peril
as
he
wades
through
the
turbulent
water
or
leaps
from
rock
to
rock
or
from
log
to
log
in
his
efforts
to
prevent
his
charges
from
stranding
when
the
drive
is
finished
the
labours
are
over
until
the
return
of
autumn
recalls
him
to
the
forest
illustration
lacrosse
headpiece
what
the
game
of
cricket
is
to
england
and
the
game
of
to
the
united
states
is
the
game
of
lacrosse
to
canada
and
yet
it
is
worth
noting
that
both
cricket
and
flourish
in
canada
which
goes
to
show
that
the
young
canadian
seeks
for
quantity
as
well
as
quality
in
his
sport
the
indians
invented
lacrosse
just
as
they
invented
the
canoe
the
and
the
toboggan
and
it
is
not
likely
that
their
brother
will
be
able
to
invent
something
surpassing
any
of
them
how
long
ago
they
invented
lacrosse
is
a
question
not
even
parkman
nor
catlin
can
tell
us
the
redskins
have
never
had
newspapers
and
seem
to
have
been
poor
hands
at
keeping
diaries
consequently
we
can
never
hope
to
know
when
first
the
iroquois
champion
team
led
by
the
famous
chief
defeated
the
cree
champions
under
the
no
less
renowned
catlin
who
saw
it
played
by
six
hundred
eight
hundred
or
even
one
thousand
choctaws
at
a
time
tells
us
that
the
players
would
trip
and
throw
each
other
and
sometimes
take
flying
leaps
over
the
heads
of
their
stooping
opponents
or
dart
between
their
extended
legs
there
are
times
he
adds
when
the
ball
gets
to
the
ground
when
there
is
a
confused
mass
of
sticks
shins
and
bloody
noses
i
may
add
on
my
own
account
that
those
times
are
not
altogether
past
and
gone
scratched
shins
and
crimsoned
noses
are
still
to
be
found
on
the
there
is
of
course
a
good
deal
of
difference
between
lacrosse
as
played
by
the
whites
and
as
it
was
played
by
the
redskins
half
a
century
ago
in
the
first
place
the
ground
was
not
a
level
lawn
with
a
cinder
path
around
it
and
beyond
that
rows
of
seats
for
spectators
but
a
glade
in
the
forest
interspersed
with
stumps
of
trees
fallen
trunks
and
clumps
of
young
spruce
the
goals
were
single
poles
or
stakes
about
eight
feet
high
and
the
distance
between
them
varied
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
players
from
five
hundred
yards
to
or
even
more
then
the
crosse
was
much
shorter
and
smaller
as
to
its
netting
while
among
some
tribes
no
netting
at
all
was
used
but
instead
thereof
two
sticks
having
ends
between
which
the
ball
was
caught
and
carried
as
to
the
dress
of
the
the
difference
is
not
so
very
great
the
white
men
wear
a
little
more
on
their
backs
and
canvas
shoes
instead
of
moccasins
on
their
feet
and
that
is
about
the
sum
of
the
matter
i
will
now
try
to
describe
the
game
as
it
is
played
by
the
canadian
clubs
the
ground
should
be
a
smooth
level
field
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
in
length
by
one
hundred
in
breadth
at
the
very
least
and
for
championship
matches
another
fifty
yards
each
way
is
most
desirable
the
goals
should
be
one
hundred
and
yards
apart
but
a
lesser
distance
may
be
agreed
upon
between
the
two
captains
if
the
nature
of
the
ground
requires
it
the
side
boundaries
are
formed
by
the
fence
or
ring
of
spectators
as
the
case
may
be
if
the
ball
goes
over
the
one
or
gets
tangled
up
with
the
other
it
has
to
be
brought
out
and
faced
the
nature
of
facing
will
be
explained
further
on
the
goals
are
simply
two
poles
six
feet
high
and
six
feet
apart
and
in
front
of
them
at
a
lacrosse
length
from
their
base
a
line
is
marked
with
whitewash
inside
of
which
no
attacking
player
must
enter
unless
the
ball
has
preceded
him
if
he
enters
in
advance
of
the
ball
the
may
drive
him
out
at
the
point
of
his
stick
and
use
any
violence
necessary
for
that
purpose
the
side
consists
of
twelve
players
and
a
captain
the
captain
does
not
play
he
simply
runs
round
and
shouts
at
the
other
fellows
it
looks
like
an
easy
job
but
it
is
far
from
being
so
upon
the
captain
very
often
depends
the
fate
of
his
team
and
he
should
always
be
a
cool
experienced
player
thoroughly
up
to
all
the
tricks
and
subtleties
of
the
game
the
or
crosses
as
they
are
called
are
light
strong
sticks
made
of
either
hickory
ash
or
rock
elm
the
indian
preferring
the
first
because
of
its
strength
and
the
white
man
the
other
two
because
of
their
lightness
there
is
no
rule
as
to
the
length
of
a
stick
but
practical
experience
has
shown
that
the
most
convenient
length
is
equal
to
the
distance
from
the
toe
to
the
hollow
under
the
arm
each
player
can
therefore
suit
himself
in
the
matter
the
netting
is
of
gut
and
should
be
about
inches
long
and
must
not
be
more
than
twelve
inches
wide
at
its
widest
part
nine
inches
is
a
good
average
width
there
must
be
no
bag
to
the
netting
and
to
guard
against
this
the
referee
is
required
to
inspect
the
crosses
carefully
before
allowing
the
match
to
begin
the
ball
is
of
sponge
about
less
in
circumference
than
a
and
weighing
about
four
ounces
it
should
bounce
freely
as
this
adds
greatly
to
the
uncertainty
and
interest
of
the
game
all
the
preliminaries
having
been
satisfactorily
arranged
a
fine
day
a
good
ground
and
a
large
gathering
of
spectators
secured
we
will
suppose
that
a
championship
match
between
the
representative
teams
of
montreal
and
toronto
is
about
to
take
place
at
the
appointed
hour
the
teams
issue
from
their
amid
the
cheers
of
their
adherents
and
line
up
before
the
referee
and
umpires
that
is
they
face
one
another
in
two
parallel
lines
and
then
the
referee
proceeds
to
examine
their
crosses
lest
they
should
be
bagged
and
their
shoes
lest
they
may
be
spiked
he
also
addresses
a
word
of
warning
to
them
upon
the
subject
of
rough
play
which
unhappily
has
become
far
too
common
of
late
he
then
dismisses
them
and
they
take
up
their
places
on
the
field
when
this
is
done
they
take
their
positions
in
pairs
each
man
having
an
opponent
opposite
him
thus
the
montreal
has
the
toronto
inside
home
just
in
front
of
him
each
of
the
fielders
has
a
man
to
cover
him
as
the
term
is
and
there
is
a
toronto
centre
as
well
as
a
montreal
centre
the
game
is
begun
by
the
two
centre
fielders
they
half
kneel
opposite
each
other
and
lay
their
crosses
on
the
ground
face
to
face
every
nerve
and
muscle
tingling
with
excitement
for
much
may
depend
upon
which
gets
the
advantage
at
the
start
this
is
called
facing
the
ball
and
when
the
referee
is
satisfied
that
everything
is
in
readiness
he
places
the
ball
between
the
two
crosses
taking
care
that
it
is
exactly
in
the
middle
at
his
shout
of
play
the
two
centres
strive
by
a
sharp
sudden
twist
of
the
crosse
each
to
draw
the
ball
in
his
own
direction
the
successful
one
immediately
passes
it
to
the
nearest
fielder
on
his
own
side
who
is
instantly
pounced
upon
by
his
cover
and
then
the
fun
begins
in
fierce
earnest
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
to
convey
through
the
medium
of
print
any
adequate
conception
of
the
interest
and
excitement
that
a
game
of
lacrosse
between
two
teams
affords
for
brilliancy
of
individual
effort
as
well
as
of
combined
team
play
for
incessant
movement
and
thrilling
situations
for
displays
of
undaunted
pluck
or
untiring
fleetness
there
is
no
game
that
can
compare
with
it
the
ball
flies
all
over
the
field
now
soaring
like
a
bird
through
the
air
now
skimming
along
the
ground
like
a
frightened
first
one
goal
is
in
danger
and
the
players
crowd
so
thickly
about
it
that
you
can
not
see
the
then
a
long
throw
from
his
skilful
stick
sends
the
rubber
away
off
to
the
side
or
perhaps
almost
down
to
the
other
goal
and
two
dangers
are
over
for
the
time
next
an
artful
dodger
will
catch
the
ball
on
his
crosse
and
turning
twisting
dodging
this
way
and
that
dropping
the
ball
when
checked
only
to
pick
it
up
again
deftly
after
the
checker
is
eluded
will
amid
the
shouts
and
cries
of
spectators
and
players
alike
carry
it
clear
down
the
whole
length
of
the
field
and
perhaps
if
he
be
very
lucky
send
a
grounder
between
the
ere
the
has
time
to
recover
from
the
surprise
of
his
onset
in
the
throwing
catching
checking
running
and
dodging
which
the
game
calls
for
every
muscle
and
sinew
is
given
fullest
exercise
and
every
man
in
the
team
has
a
share
of
the
work
there
is
no
loafing
possible
in
lacrosse
as
there
is
in
and
cricket
when
the
are
getting
nothing
to
do
even
the
has
plenty
of
hard
work
for
whenever
the
ball
goes
behind
the
he
must
go
after
it
and
struggle
for
it
until
he
can
send
it
either
to
one
of
his
own
side
or
far
down
the
field
indeed
the
ability
to
play
well
behind
the
flags
is
as
important
a
quality
in
a
as
an
watchfulness
over
what
is
going
on
in
front
of
him
while
individual
play
as
it
is
sometimes
all
very
well
in
its
way
good
is
far
more
effective
in
the
end
and
it
is
just
because
the
whites
excel
in
the
latter
that
they
have
become
more
than
a
match
for
the
redskins
from
whom
they
have
adopted
the
game
one
of
the
prettiest
sights
imaginable
is
to
see
two
expert
players
tobying
to
one
another
for
perhaps
half
the
length
of
the
field
before
they
can
be
stopped
this
tobying
consists
in
their
running
along
ten
or
fifteen
yards
apart
and
throwing
the
ball
from
one
to
the
other
so
soon
as
there
is
danger
of
the
one
carrying
it
being
checked
another
valuable
accomplishment
in
a
is
knowing
how
and
when
to
uncover
is
to
stop
away
from
the
opponent
who
has
been
deputed
to
cover
him
and
consequently
be
free
to
snatch
up
the
ball
the
moment
it
comes
his
way
when
one
team
understands
this
better
than
the
other
the
result
is
to
convey
the
impression
that
it
must
have
more
players
because
there
always
seem
to
be
two
of
them
at
least
wherever
the
rubber
is
the
game
is
won
by
the
ball
being
thrown
between
the
not
higher
than
an
imaginary
line
drawn
across
their
tops
it
must
of
course
be
thrown
through
from
in
front
formerly
a
match
was
decided
by
the
winning
of
three
games
best
three
out
of
five
but
in
one
of
the
two
lacrosse
associations
now
existing
in
canada
a
change
has
been
made
and
unless
one
team
wins
three
games
straight
play
must
be
continued
for
two
hours
and
then
the
team
having
the
most
games
wins
the
match
the
reason
of
the
change
was
that
in
some
cases
a
team
would
take
three
games
from
their
opponents
in
a
few
minutes
and
at
this
the
spectators
grumbled
the
most
interesting
recent
event
in
the
history
of
the
game
in
canada
is
the
visit
of
the
famous
toronto
twelve
to
great
britain
they
are
a
splendid
lot
of
players
and
seem
to
have
it
all
their
own
way
as
might
be
expected
the
fact
however
that
there
are
enough
lacrosse
clubs
in
the
old
country
to
make
it
worth
their
while
to
go
over
proves
that
the
game
is
making
progress
round
the
world
indeed
it
has
been
already
heard
of
from
australia
india
china
and
other
quarters
of
the
globe
in
the
united
states
it
is
spreading
rapidly
and
the
time
can
not
be
far
distant
when
we
shall
have
international
struggles
for
supremacy
in
lacrosse
as
well
contested
as
we
already
have
in
some
other
sports
some
years
ago
a
team
from
the
united
states
crossed
the
atlantic
to
contend
against
their
british
cousins
and
succeeded
in
winning
every
match
they
played
but
one
full
of
apples
o
bring
a
sheet
and
charlie
draper
gazed
at
the
piece
of
paper
containing
these
simple
words
and
mysterious
signature
with
mingled
feelings
of
pride
and
because
it
was
the
first
time
since
his
coming
to
twin
elm
academy
that
he
had
been
the
recipient
of
one
of
these
missives
and
trepidation
because
he
had
very
vague
notions
of
what
his
accepting
the
invitation
it
bore
might
entail
he
was
a
new
boy
just
finishing
his
first
month
at
the
academy
and
being
of
rather
reserved
disposition
had
been
slow
in
forming
acquaintances
indeed
but
for
an
incident
that
suddenly
brought
him
into
prominence
he
might
have
made
still
poorer
progress
in
this
direction
than
he
did
a
few
days
before
this
communication
from
abracadabra
a
party
of
the
boys
were
bathing
in
the
river
near
deep
pool
a
youngster
who
could
not
swim
rashly
ventured
too
near
the
pool
and
disappeared
in
its
dark
depths
there
arose
an
immediate
chorus
of
cries
from
his
companions
but
no
intelligent
effort
was
being
made
at
rescue
when
charlie
draper
who
had
not
been
of
the
party
came
rushing
up
threw
off
his
cap
and
coat
plunged
into
the
pool
and
brought
out
the
drowning
boy
at
the
first
try
of
course
he
was
a
hero
at
once
and
the
leaders
of
the
a
o
secret
society
of
the
academy
of
which
charlie
had
already
heard
much
and
admittance
to
which
was
the
desire
of
his
no
time
in
deciding
that
he
was
beyond
question
one
of
the
right
sort
and
that
he
must
become
one
of
them
forthwith
hence
the
short
but
significant
summons
whose
contents
have
been
already
given
promptly
at
ten
charlie
in
his
stocking
feet
and
provided
with
and
sheet
crept
cautiously
up
the
long
stairs
that
led
to
the
all
the
students
except
those
who
belonged
to
the
society
were
already
sound
asleep
and
the
two
tutors
who
lived
in
the
building
knowing
nothing
of
this
exception
and
imagining
that
every
cot
was
duly
occupied
had
settled
down
for
a
comfortable
smoke
and
chat
in
the
cozy
of
butler
whose
quarters
were
farthest
away
from
the
upon
all
this
the
members
of
the
society
had
astutely
reckoned
and
the
coast
was
accordingly
clear
for
them
to
do
as
they
pleased
as
long
as
they
did
not
make
too
much
noise
about
it
bearing
his
note
of
invitation
as
a
passport
charlie
approached
the
door
of
the
suddenly
out
of
its
shadow
a
masked
and
draped
figure
darted
and
putting
its
hand
to
his
throat
inquired
in
a
very
husky
voice
what
doest
thou
here
for
answer
charlie
held
up
his
sheet
and
slip
of
paper
well
pass
on
said
the
husky
mystery
and
with
palpitating
heart
charlie
tiptoed
through
the
door
the
moment
he
passed
the
portal
two
other
masked
and
draped
figures
seized
him
by
either
arm
and
hurried
him
before
a
fourth
figure
who
occupied
a
sort
of
throne
at
the
far
corner
of
the
room
whom
do
you
bring
before
me
asked
this
potentate
in
the
husky
tone
which
seemed
to
be
characteristic
of
the
society
charles
draper
may
it
please
your
sublimity
was
the
reply
accompanied
by
a
reverent
obeisance
in
which
charlie
was
directed
to
join
he
hath
been
well
recommended
to
us
let
him
be
put
to
the
tests
if
he
doth
survive
them
and
will
take
the
oaths
he
may
be
admitted
into
membership
then
followed
a
lot
of
the
usual
elaborate
nonsense
such
as
boys
delight
to
invent
and
execute
in
connection
with
their
secret
societies
and
at
the
end
of
fifteen
minutes
or
so
charlie
flushed
and
excited
but
triumphant
was
handed
a
gown
and
mask
and
informed
by
the
figure
on
the
throne
whose
official
title
was
the
same
as
the
signature
to
the
invitation
that
he
was
duly
admitted
into
the
membership
of
the
society
whose
full
name
he
now
learned
was
the
ancient
and
honourable
order
of
apple
stealers
the
next
piece
of
information
he
received
rather
staggered
him
it
was
that
according
to
the
rules
of
the
society
he
must
at
once
justify
the
confidence
its
members
had
reposed
in
him
by
proving
his
prowess
as
an
the
august
pippins
in
squire
orchard
were
reported
to
be
ready
to
drop
into
mouth
upon
the
novice
charles
draper
devolved
the
perilous
duty
of
securing
a
generous
sample
of
those
juicy
golden
globes
so
that
the
ancient
and
honourable
order
might
pronounce
judgment
on
their
excellence
so
soon
as
he
understood
this
charlie
began
to
wish
he
had
not
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
join
the
society
he
had
been
at
twin
elm
long
enough
to
learn
that
old
squire
dogs
were
as
good
in
their
way
as
his
apples
were
in
theirs
and
he
did
not
at
all
relish
the
prospect
of
having
an
argument
with
them
in
their
own
territory
at
the
dead
of
night
but
he
was
too
stout
of
heart
to
back
out
or
even
to
show
any
signs
of
flinching
as
his
sublimity
proceeded
to
give
him
his
instructions
each
member
had
brought
a
sheet
with
him
these
were
quickly
converted
into
a
rope
which
reached
from
the
window
of
the
to
the
ground
stuffing
the
into
his
pocket
and
putting
on
his
shoes
charlie
amid
the
whispered
commands
of
his
be
sure
and
fill
the
call
the
dogs
bad
names
give
the
compliments
of
the
order
to
the
squire
if
you
happen
to
meet
him
and
other
inspiring
carefully
out
of
the
window
and
let
himself
down
hand
over
hand
to
the
ground
pausing
only
to
kiss
his
hand
to
the
faces
at
the
window
he
hastened
off
noiselessly
over
the
grass
in
the
direction
of
the
orchard
he
knew
his
route
well
enough
and
the
distance
was
not
quite
so
that
a
few
quick
walking
brought
him
to
his
destination
the
ribston
mansion
stood
well
back
from
the
road
and
the
orchard
lay
to
its
rear
charlie
therefore
thought
it
well
to
leave
the
road
before
he
reached
the
gate
and
to
take
a
slant
through
the
fields
that
brought
him
up
to
the
orchard
fence
about
fifty
yards
behind
the
house
here
he
crouched
down
and
listened
with
strained
ears
and
throbbing
pulses
for
the
slightest
sound
that
might
indicate
the
proximity
of
a
dog
but
not
a
growl
or
bark
or
even
sniff
broke
the
stillness
as
it
chanced
he
had
hit
upon
a
particularly
favourable
night
for
his
enterprise
the
good
squire
being
wont
to
spend
his
friday
evenings
with
admirable
regularity
at
doctor
where
the
genial
rector
of
and
important
judge
surrebutter
helped
to
make
up
a
quartette
that
could
play
whist
by
the
hour
without
so
much
as
winking
for
the
sake
of
company
on
the
way
home
the
squire
always
took
his
dogs
with
him
so
that
until
his
return
which
was
never
later
than
eleven
the
ribston
premises
were
entirely
unguarded
encouraged
by
the
perfect
silence
charlie
gently
got
over
the
fence
and
making
his
way
to
the
august
set
diligently
to
work
to
fill
his
the
boughs
were
bending
low
beneath
their
weight
of
juicy
fruit
and
he
had
no
need
to
shake
them
there
were
far
more
apples
within
easy
reach
of
his
hand
than
he
could
carry
home
five
minutes
sufficed
to
fill
the
and
then
with
a
vast
sigh
of
relief
he
crawled
back
over
the
fence
hastened
across
the
field
and
came
to
the
fence
beside
the
road
knowing
nothing
of
the
whist
club
he
took
it
for
granted
that
all
danger
was
practically
over
and
without
looking
to
right
or
left
he
tossed
his
bag
over
the
fence
and
vaulted
lightly
after
it
hardly
had
his
feet
touched
the
ground
than
a
sharp
suspicious
bark
came
from
only
a
few
yards
away
and
the
next
moment
a
collie
dog
followed
closely
by
a
bounded
toward
him
barking
fiercely
while
looming
dimly
through
the
darkness
the
portly
form
of
their
owner
could
be
descried
as
he
demanded
angrily
who
are
you
and
what
are
you
about
charlie
could
have
answered
both
questions
easily
enough
had
he
chosen
to
do
so
but
the
time
did
not
seem
to
him
altogether
favourable
and
instead
of
a
verbal
reply
he
picked
up
his
threw
it
over
his
shoulder
and
took
to
his
heels
with
the
dogs
after
him
in
full
cry
catch
him
grip
catch
him
oscar
shouted
the
squire
to
his
dogs
as
he
joined
in
the
chase
with
all
his
might
although
hardly
in
condition
for
a
sprinting
match
squire
bibston
had
been
renowned
for
fleetness
of
foot
in
his
younger
days
and
he
showed
a
surprising
turn
of
speed
as
he
dashed
down
the
road
after
the
fleeing
boy
now
had
charlie
dropped
his
heavy
he
might
have
distanced
his
human
pursuer
easily
and
as
the
dogs
seemed
to
be
content
with
barking
and
to
have
no
idea
of
biting
the
irate
squire
would
never
have
known
more
about
the
daring
raider
of
his
orchard
than
his
strong
suspicion
that
it
was
one
of
those
rascally
twin
elm
boys
but
to
let
go
his
burden
was
the
last
thing
charlie
thought
of
doing
to
his
daring
determined
nature
only
two
alternatives
presented
with
his
booty
or
capture
so
away
he
sped
holding
tight
to
the
the
collie
and
terrier
punctuating
his
strenuous
strides
with
short
sharp
barks
after
his
first
furious
spurt
the
speed
rapidly
slackened
until
it
became
little
more
than
a
laboured
and
by
the
time
he
reached
the
entrance
to
the
long
avenue
leading
from
the
main
road
to
the
academy
charlie
was
under
the
window
and
jerking
the
by
way
of
a
signal
to
the
boys
to
haul
him
up
unfortunately
they
were
so
occupied
with
some
of
their
nonsense
that
they
did
not
at
first
observe
the
signal
and
precious
moments
were
lost
before
they
responded
so
that
anxious
ears
caught
the
sound
of
the
panting
as
he
toiled
gamely
along
the
avenue
illustration
charlie
climbing
the
hurry
up
boys
he
called
as
loudly
as
he
dared
the
after
me
the
boys
responded
with
a
sudden
jerk
that
snatched
him
off
the
ground
and
nearly
made
him
drop
the
apples
then
up
he
went
more
steadily
foot
by
foot
but
he
was
not
to
the
window
when
the
squire
guided
by
his
clever
dogs
arrived
upon
the
scene
and
in
spite
of
the
his
keen
old
eyes
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
aha
you
young
scoundrel
i
have
you
now
take
that
and
he
hurled
his
stout
oak
cane
at
the
ascending
boy
the
result
greatly
exceeded
his
expectations
for
the
stick
going
straight
to
its
mark
gave
charlie
such
a
stinging
blow
that
he
involuntarily
let
go
of
the
weighty
and
down
it
dropped
full
upon
the
pate
crushing
his
tall
gray
beaver
over
his
eyes
and
sending
him
headlong
to
the
ground
it
was
some
moments
before
he
could
pick
himself
up
again
and
by
that
time
charlie
was
safe
inside
the
window
beside
himself
with
wrath
the
squire
assailed
the
front
door
with
furious
blows
bringing
both
the
tutors
out
in
startled
haste
to
them
as
well
as
his
breathless
disordered
condition
permitted
he
explained
himself
and
was
at
once
invited
to
enter
while
butler
went
for
professor
rodwell
on
the
arrival
all
the
boys
were
summoned
to
appear
in
the
and
presently
in
they
flocked
all
but
the
members
of
the
a
o
who
by
the
way
had
managed
to
get
into
their
with
marvellous
celerity
manifesting
their
innocence
by
their
unmistakably
startled
sleepy
faces
are
all
the
boys
here
asked
the
squire
suspiciously
on
finding
every
one
arrayed
in
his
professor
rodwell
counted
heads
carefully
yes
squire
all
the
boys
are
present
he
replied
humph
snapped
the
squire
a
clever
trick
but
they
pull
the
wool
over
my
eyes
in
that
way
an
anxious
expectant
hush
following
professor
rodwell
addressed
the
boys
in
grave
yet
not
unkindly
tones
young
gentlemen
it
is
clear
beyond
possibility
of
denial
that
some
of
you
have
been
guilty
of
robbing
squire
orchard
now
i
dare
say
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
trace
out
the
culprits
but
i
would
much
prefer
that
they
should
acknowledge
their
of
their
own
accord
i
therefore
wait
to
give
them
the
opportunity
there
was
but
a
pause
and
then
charlie
draper
stepping
forward
said
in
a
steady
voice
looking
full
at
professor
rodwell
it
was
i
that
took
squire
apples
let
me
bear
all
the
punishment
a
look
of
mingled
surprise
and
relief
came
into
the
troubled
face
and
even
the
countenance
seemed
to
take
on
a
softer
expression
touched
with
approval
of
this
frank
avowal
charles
draper
i
am
very
sorry
said
professor
rodwell
slowly
although
been
but
a
short
time
with
us
i
had
thought
better
things
of
you
than
this
eyes
fell
and
his
lip
began
to
tremble
he
was
already
feeling
deep
regret
for
his
part
in
the
matter
and
these
gentle
words
touched
him
to
the
heart
he
was
just
about
to
express
his
contrition
and
ask
for
sentence
upon
himself
when
the
squire
exclaimed
charlie
draper
is
that
charlie
draper
it
is
replied
professor
rodwell
wondering
why
the
squire
asked
the
same
boy
that
saved
my
little
grandson
hughie
from
drowning
in
deep
pool
a
week
ago
yes
squire
the
same
boy
replied
the
professor
now
beginning
to
catch
the
old
drift
then
cried
the
squire
who
was
as
quick
of
generous
impulse
as
he
was
of
temper
jumping
from
his
seat
and
advancing
toward
charlie
i
want
this
thing
to
go
any
my
hand
my
brave
lad
welcome
to
every
apple
on
the
tree
if
only
come
after
them
in
honest
manly
fashion
and
not
be
playing
such
foolish
pranks
skulking
through
the
fields
when
you
ought
to
be
now
professor
rodwell
cry
quits
willing
to
let
the
matter
rest
boys
will
be
boys
and
if
your
boys
will
promise
never
to
go
out
robbing
orchards
again
promise
to
let
into
my
orchard
on
saturday
afternoons
and
take
every
apple
they
find
in
the
grass
so
long
as
the
crop
lasts
for
a
moment
the
boys
were
so
bewildered
by
these
astounding
words
that
they
could
hardly
credit
their
ears
then
a
spontaneous
cheer
burst
from
their
throats
and
the
upshot
of
the
whole
matter
was
that
they
heartily
gave
the
promise
the
squire
asked
and
the
professor
relieved
beyond
measure
at
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
dismissed
them
with
the
understanding
that
the
doings
should
be
no
further
inquired
into
provided
good
behaviour
was
maintained
in
future
the
pledge
thus
given
taking
away
from
the
a
o
its
principal
reason
for
existing
under
that
name
did
not
however
put
an
end
to
its
career
it
simply
altered
its
title
and
amended
its
ways
and
continued
to
flourish
as
vigorously
as
before
with
charlie
draper
as
one
of
its
most
popular
and
active
members
on
lake
st
louis
the
great
river
lawrence
as
if
not
content
with
its
ordinary
ample
breadth
a
few
miles
above
the
city
of
montreal
spreads
out
into
a
wide
sheet
of
water
which
is
known
as
lake
louis
lake
louis
is
about
twelve
miles
long
by
eight
in
width
at
its
widest
part
and
being
famous
for
its
cool
breezes
the
people
from
the
city
go
out
there
in
throngs
every
summer
so
that
its
shores
are
well
populated
as
long
as
the
thermometer
keeps
well
above
the
seventy
point
in
winter
however
it
is
very
different
then
jack
frost
has
a
confirmed
habit
of
sending
the
mercury
away
down
down
down
not
only
below
but
below
zero
even
and
the
blue
waters
of
the
lake
turn
into
a
floor
as
hard
as
steel
over
which
the
snows
drift
and
pile
up
and
scatter
again
in
fantastic
windrows
until
the
warm
spring
sunshine
melts
them
into
soggy
slush
and
a
little
later
rends
the
solid
floor
itself
asunder
and
sends
it
careering
down
the
current
in
great
jagged
there
is
nothing
undecided
about
a
canadian
winter
the
means
business
from
the
start
and
for
three
long
months
keeps
a
tight
grip
upon
the
land
some
winters
of
course
he
is
more
tyrannical
than
others
the
ross
boys
for
instance
thought
that
he
had
never
before
in
their
experience
been
so
unmerciful
as
during
the
season
that
the
event
happened
about
which
i
am
now
going
to
tell
day
after
day
for
weeks
at
a
time
the
thermometer
would
not
get
up
to
the
zero
mark
at
all
while
it
would
at
night
drop
as
much
as
thirty
points
below
it
my
word
this
sort
of
weather
fair
at
all
said
bob
ross
in
an
impatient
tone
at
the
one
morning
a
fellow
can
hardly
stir
out
of
doors
without
getting
his
nose
or
ears
nipped
my
nose
was
for
the
third
time
last
night
and
a
little
too
much
of
a
good
thing
for
me
right
your
are
bob
chimed
in
phil
his
elder
brother
from
across
the
table
my
poor
ears
have
been
nipped
nobody
knows
how
often
i
expect
one
of
them
will
drop
off
some
fine
day
a
keen
winter
boys
no
doubt
assented
ross
i
remember
many
as
sharp
but
the
longest
winter
has
an
end
and
forget
all
about
the
cold
the
first
warm
day
that
comes
that
may
be
father
answered
bob
but
like
a
little
mild
weather
right
now
if
the
has
no
objections
you
know
going
over
to
the
church
festival
at
beauharnois
night
and
an
tramp
in
this
cold
weather
is
not
just
what
hankering
i
mean
to
go
all
the
same
tut
my
lad
when
i
was
your
age
i
would
have
thought
nothing
of
double
the
distance
if
only
a
certain
person
were
at
the
end
of
it
replied
ross
with
a
meaning
smile
at
his
wife
as
he
added
but
perhaps
you
have
no
such
attraction
not
i
laughed
bob
going
for
the
sake
of
the
supper
but
i
answer
for
phil
looking
quizzically
at
his
brother
who
blushed
violently
and
made
a
timely
diversion
by
springing
up
and
saying
come
along
bob
let
us
get
at
our
work
cold
or
no
cold
whereupon
the
two
lads
went
off
together
eoss
owned
one
of
the
largest
and
finest
among
the
many
farms
that
bordered
upon
lake
louis
although
he
was
what
might
be
called
a
gentleman
farmer
he
was
a
thoroughly
practical
farmer
too
he
made
his
farm
pay
him
handsomely
and
thought
so
well
of
his
occupation
that
he
had
brought
up
his
two
boys
to
follow
it
also
when
they
were
grown
men
he
would
divide
the
greater
part
of
his
property
between
them
reserving
only
sufficient
to
keep
himself
and
his
wife
in
independent
comfort
during
the
remainder
of
their
days
the
two
sons
phil
and
bob
at
the
time
of
my
story
about
sixteen
and
fourteen
years
of
age
respectively
were
as
satisfactory
a
pair
of
boys
as
parents
could
wish
one
the
elder
tall
and
dark
the
other
short
and
fair
both
were
strong
healthy
hearty
lads
full
of
spirit
and
fond
enough
of
having
their
own
way
but
thoroughly
sound
at
heart
and
passionately
fond
of
father
and
mother
although
trained
to
all
kinds
of
farm
work
their
education
had
not
been
by
any
means
neglected
they
had
had
a
good
share
of
schooling
and
ross
never
went
into
the
city
without
bringing
back
a
new
book
or
the
latest
magazine
so
that
they
might
keep
up
with
the
spirit
of
the
times
the
church
festival
bob
spoke
of
was
to
take
place
the
following
evening
at
beauharnois
a
village
that
stood
straight
across
the
lake
as
the
crow
flies
a
distance
of
about
eight
miles
the
snow
was
in
capital
condition
for
and
the
two
sturdy
boys
thought
nothing
of
the
tramp
there
and
back
they
would
start
from
home
at
four
in
the
afternoon
make
beauharnois
about
six
enjoy
themselves
there
to
the
best
of
their
ability
until
ten
and
then
set
off
for
home
where
they
ought
to
turn
up
soon
after
midnight
much
to
their
gratification
the
cold
next
morning
showed
signs
of
moderating
looks
as
if
the
was
interested
in
the
festival
remarked
phil
in
the
course
of
the
morning
his
beaming
face
revealing
clearly
enough
that
others
than
the
were
interested
in
the
same
event
glad
it
quite
so
keen
as
yesterday
answered
bob
a
fellow
will
enjoy
the
spread
all
the
better
for
not
going
to
it
with
his
nose
frozen
i
wonder
if
we
had
a
regular
change
said
ross
casting
a
searching
glance
at
the
sky
which
was
evidently
losing
its
sharp
blue
tinge
and
becoming
ashen
gray
in
colour
we
often
do
have
a
soft
spell
about
this
time
of
the
year
most
likely
be
snow
soon
i
hope
it
begin
before
you
get
home
boys
oh
i
think
not
replied
phil
confidently
it
come
much
sooner
than
the
morning
the
hours
of
the
day
slipped
quickly
by
and
sharp
at
four
the
two
boys
set
forth
on
their
long
tramp
they
certainly
were
a
prepossessing
pair
in
their
white
that
became
them
so
well
tied
with
broad
scarlet
sashes
and
blue
caps
with
scarlet
tassels
on
their
heads
bidding
to
their
parents
who
stood
at
the
door
watching
them
with
fond
pride
phil
and
bob
strode
swiftly
down
the
slope
to
the
lake
and
soon
were
tramping
over
its
broad
bosom
upon
which
the
snow
lay
deep
in
undulating
waves
barring
the
leaden
hue
of
the
sky
the
afternoon
could
hardly
have
been
finer
the
stinging
cold
was
gone
yet
the
air
was
keen
enough
to
be
bracing
there
was
little
or
no
wind
the
snow
was
well
packed
and
full
of
joyful
expectations
the
brothers
walked
on
side
by
side
their
broad
bearing
them
easily
upon
the
very
surface
of
the
drifts
eight
miles
in
two
hours
was
no
remarkable
performance
for
two
such
expert
as
they
and
they
accomplished
it
without
difficulty
reaching
their
destination
just
as
the
bell
in
the
tower
of
the
church
boomed
out
six
solemn
strokes
leaving
their
coats
and
at
a
house
they
hastened
to
the
place
where
the
festival
was
in
full
swing
and
entered
heartily
into
the
enjoyments
each
following
his
own
bent
the
expectations
of
both
were
fully
satisfied
the
supper
presented
more
dainties
on
its
generous
bill
of
fare
than
even
the
capacious
appetite
of
bob
could
comfortably
sample
and
phil
was
not
disappointed
in
the
light
that
shone
from
a
certain
pair
of
brown
eyes
that
for
some
mysterious
reason
had
more
attraction
for
him
than
anything
else
the
entertainment
offered
ten
came
all
too
soon
for
him
especially
as
the
festival
was
not
entirely
over
although
some
of
those
who
lived
at
a
distance
had
already
left
but
bob
was
rather
glad
as
the
last
hour
had
been
somewhat
slow
from
his
point
of
view
so
siding
up
to
phil
he
whispered
discreetly
in
his
ear
time
to
go
phil
ten
phil
pulled
out
his
watch
with
an
incredulous
look
but
alas
it
told
the
same
story
as
bob
and
dearly
as
he
would
have
liked
to
linger
he
knew
well
enough
that
the
sooner
they
started
now
the
better
so
with
a
very
regretful
adieu
to
the
one
whose
presence
had
made
the
assembly
shine
he
joined
his
brother
at
the
door
when
they
got
outside
the
look
of
the
night
and
the
feel
of
the
air
told
them
that
the
snow
was
nearer
at
hand
than
they
had
expected
in
fact
a
few
soft
sly
flakes
were
already
dropping
noiselessly
the
friend
at
whose
house
they
had
left
their
coats
and
suggested
their
staying
all
night
but
although
bob
was
nothing
loath
phil
would
not
be
persuaded
father
said
wait
up
for
us
he
objected
and
get
anxious
if
not
home
by
twelve
along
bob
accordingly
off
they
went
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
when
they
reached
the
shore
of
the
lake
they
could
just
see
the
glimmer
of
the
village
lights
by
which
they
were
to
be
home
lying
about
to
the
left
although
their
pace
was
far
from
a
loitering
one
they
did
not
get
over
the
snow
by
any
means
so
fast
as
in
the
afternoon
bob
was
not
only
tired
and
sleepy
but
provoked
with
phil
for
refusing
to
stay
all
night
at
their
house
indeed
he
hoped
his
brother
would
yet
repent
and
return
and
so
his
feet
dragged
not
a
little
noticing
this
phil
said
briskly
step
out
bob
have
all
we
can
do
to
get
across
before
the
snow
comes
all
well
enough
to
say
out
answered
bob
gruffly
why
you
stay
overnight
too
tired
to
walk
fast
anyhow
snow
or
no
snow
oh
not
tired
bob
eaten
a
little
too
much
supper
all
rejoined
phil
pleasantly
bob
vouchsafed
no
answer
and
for
some
time
the
brothers
tramped
along
in
silence
as
they
neared
the
centre
of
the
lake
the
which
had
at
first
been
few
and
far
between
thickened
rapidly
and
the
wind
at
the
same
time
rose
into
gusts
that
blew
them
sharply
into
the
faces
a
thrill
of
alarm
shot
threw
phil
and
grasping
arm
he
called
out
it
looks
nasty
bob
put
on
a
spurt
at
this
appeal
bob
roused
himself
and
quickening
their
pace
to
a
trot
they
hastened
onward
their
rising
and
falling
in
steady
unbroken
step
every
minute
the
snow
and
wind
increased
until
at
length
the
storm
in
full
force
burst
upon
the
boys
and
almost
blew
them
off
their
feet
all
around
them
the
air
was
filled
with
flakes
of
white
whirling
about
in
bewildering
myriads
splashing
like
fine
spray
into
their
faces
and
stinging
like
small
shot
for
the
wind
was
bitterly
cold
presently
phil
halted
and
peering
hard
into
the
blinding
storm
cried
anxiously
become
of
the
lights
bob
i
see
them
a
bit
can
you
panted
bob
turn
back
illustration
the
forms
of
the
two
boys
were
exposed
to
view
no
use
in
that
replied
phil
turning
round
i
see
those
behind
us
either
nothing
for
it
but
to
push
ahead
o
phil
are
we
lost
asked
bob
with
quivering
lips
phil
was
more
than
half
afraid
they
were
but
to
reassure
bob
he
answered
cheerfully
all
right
i
know
how
to
steer
come
along
and
grasping
hand
he
started
off
again
on
and
on
they
plodded
through
storm
and
snow
phil
half
dragging
bob
who
between
fright
and
real
weariness
found
difficulty
in
making
progress
at
all
for
more
they
struggled
thus
until
at
last
bob
dropped
his
hand
and
flung
himself
down
in
the
snow
sobbing
out
despairingly
no
use
phil
dead
beat
have
to
go
on
without
me
nonsense
bob
said
phil
taking
him
by
the
shoulder
jump
up
and
go
at
it
again
thus
helped
to
his
feet
bob
made
another
attempt
but
had
not
gone
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
a
way
that
was
staggering
rather
than
walking
before
down
he
slipped
again
and
this
time
all
that
phil
could
do
failed
to
rouse
him
from
his
stupor
the
cold
and
exhaustion
had
completely
overcome
him
he
had
but
one
thought
and
that
be
allowed
to
sleep
phil
fully
realized
the
danger
and
tired
as
he
was
himself
put
forth
every
exertion
to
keep
his
brother
awake
he
even
tried
to
drag
him
along
by
his
sash
in
what
he
thought
was
the
right
direction
but
of
course
soon
found
this
impossible
desert
his
brother
he
would
not
though
they
died
together
so
in
order
to
keep
himself
from
falling
into
the
same
state
he
made
a
circle
around
him
walking
slowly
while
doing
this
he
encountered
a
high
drift
whose
lee
afforded
some
shelter
from
the
blast
an
idea
flashed
into
his
mind
which
he
instantly
proceeded
to
execute
returning
to
bob
he
dragged
him
with
infinite
difficulty
to
this
spot
then
slipping
off
one
of
his
he
proceeded
to
cover
his
body
with
snow
leaving
nothing
but
his
head
exposed
the
poor
boy
now
fast
asleep
offering
no
objection
to
such
strange
bedclothes
then
sitting
down
beside
him
with
the
big
drift
protecting
his
back
he
let
the
snow
gather
over
himself
hoping
he
hardly
knew
for
what
and
praying
for
the
lord
who
sent
the
to
have
mercy
on
them
both
in
a
vague
the
stupor
was
fast
creeping
upon
him
wondered
if
his
father
had
begun
to
miss
them
yet
and
whether
he
would
come
out
in
search
of
them
he
even
dimly
pictured
his
father
sitting
in
the
parlour
at
home
reading
his
book
and
pausing
every
now
and
then
to
listen
for
his
voices
his
mother
he
knew
would
have
gone
to
bed
long
ago
he
felt
relieved
that
the
snow
no
longer
stung
his
face
and
that
the
wind
had
gone
down
completely
and
so
his
thoughts
wandered
on
until
he
knew
no
more
one
hour
two
hours
passed
and
the
drifting
snow
had
hidden
the
forms
of
the
two
boys
from
sight
when
a
long
line
of
men
might
have
been
seen
coming
from
the
village
and
scanning
carefully
every
mound
and
swell
of
the
snow
as
they
hastened
onward
in
advance
of
the
rest
strode
ross
his
face
full
of
grave
anxiety
his
eyes
intent
upon
the
white
plain
before
him
that
seemed
to
have
so
little
to
tell
now
bounding
on
ahead
and
now
returning
to
look
up
in
his
face
with
inquiring
eyes
was
his
wise
old
collie
oscar
without
whom
he
never
went
abroad
find
them
oscar
find
them
good
dog
would
ross
say
encouragingly
and
the
sagacious
animal
would
dart
on
again
presently
he
stopped
beside
a
drift
now
grown
to
huge
proportions
sniffed
sharply
at
the
snow
and
then
proceeded
to
dig
into
it
with
eager
vigorous
paws
observing
his
action
ross
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
and
sprang
forward
to
the
side
going
down
on
his
knees
he
tore
at
the
in
a
frenzy
of
haste
in
another
moment
a
red
tassel
appeared
then
a
blue
cap
then
a
white
still
face
and
others
coming
to
his
aid
the
forms
of
the
two
boys
were
exposed
to
view
phil
still
sitting
up
with
his
head
bent
over
his
knees
and
bob
lying
comfortably
beside
him
that
they
were
both
alive
was
clear
enough
for
they
were
faintly
to
be
sure
but
undoubtedly
breathing
ross
caught
up
one
after
another
in
a
passionate
embrace
then
litters
were
quickly
improvised
out
of
stripped
from
willing
backs
and
soon
the
unconscious
boys
were
speeding
homeward
as
fast
as
stalwart
arms
could
bear
them
the
rest
of
the
story
is
quickly
told
thanks
to
the
sturdy
frames
and
perfect
constitutions
the
brothers
were
only
temporarily
the
worse
for
their
experience
they
both
were
of
course
poor
nose
and
feet
coming
in
for
the
worst
of
it
but
a
few
good
nursing
cured
everything
and
no
scars
remained
to
remind
them
had
they
ever
been
likely
to
forget
it
of
the
night
they
were
lost
in
canada
it
is
a
glorious
winter
afternoon
and
having
left
the
smoke
and
din
and
dust
of
the
city
far
behind
we
are
standing
together
at
the
foot
of
the
first
of
the
dartmouth
lakes
straight
before
us
and
spreading
far
out
on
either
hand
lies
a
glistening
expanse
whose
polished
surface
flashes
back
the
cheerful
sunshine
three
unbroken
miles
in
length
and
more
than
one
in
width
this
icy
plain
awaits
us
in
its
virgin
purity
it
were
strange
then
did
not
our
fingers
tremble
with
impatience
and
our
acmes
snap
with
feverish
haste
they
are
on
at
last
and
now
for
the
supremest
luxury
of
motion
the
crisp
cool
air
is
charged
with
electricity
every
answering
nerve
tingles
delightfully
and
the
blood
leaps
responsively
through
the
throbbing
pulses
once
out
upon
the
ringing
ice
and
we
seem
to
have
passed
from
the
realm
of
solid
flesh
and
blood
to
that
of
tricksy
dainty
ariel
we
have
broken
loose
from
the
bonds
of
gravitation
and
as
with
favouring
wind
we
speed
away
to
the
farther
shore
every
stroke
of
our
feet
counting
good
for
a
quartette
of
yards
the
toiling
and
moiling
of
the
world
seem
to
have
found
at
the
margin
of
the
lake
a
magic
barrier
beyond
which
they
may
not
follow
us
and
with
spirits
light
and
free
we
glide
off
into
a
new
sphere
where
care
and
labour
are
unknown
mile
after
mile
flashes
past
yet
our
muscles
weary
not
nor
does
the
breath
grow
short
but
what
is
this
is
our
flight
already
ended
and
must
we
turn
back
so
soon
the
shores
which
were
a
little
while
ago
so
far
apart
have
drawn
together
until
they
seem
to
meet
not
far
ahead
and
put
a
bar
to
further
progress
a
cunning
turn
a
short
quick
dash
over
the
dangerous
spot
where
the
current
runs
swiftly
and
the
ice
bends
ominously
and
behold
we
are
out
again
upon
a
second
lake
still
larger
than
the
first
and
dotted
here
and
there
with
tiny
islets
that
look
like
emeralds
in
a
silver
setting
for
three
miles
more
our
way
lies
before
us
smooth
and
clear
and
then
at
last
as
having
reached
the
limit
of
our
enterprise
we
throw
ourselves
upon
a
fallen
tree
to
rest
our
now
tired
limbs
and
catch
our
diminished
breath
i
ask
which
of
wheelman
horseman
yachtsman
sculler
or
skater
enjoys
the
finest
exercise
no
country
in
the
world
presents
better
facilities
for
indulgence
in
the
luxury
of
skating
than
canada
holland
may
with
propriety
boast
of
her
smooth
canals
norway
of
her
romantic
fiords
scotland
of
her
poetic
lochs
but
for
variety
of
lake
river
canal
pond
and
frozen
sea
from
the
majestic
lawrence
to
the
humblest
stream
that
affords
delight
to
the
village
lads
and
lasses
canada
is
unsurpassed
it
is
no
wonder
then
that
the
canadians
are
a
nation
of
skaters
and
that
the
should
be
as
indispensable
an
adjunct
to
every
city
town
and
village
as
the
church
and
the
with
a
season
extending
over
four
and
often
five
months
the
managers
of
rinks
can
count
upon
receiving
profitable
returns
upon
their
capital
and
so
those
institutions
multiply
owing
to
the
great
quantity
of
snow
which
every
winter
brings
the
season
for
outdoor
skating
in
canada
is
very
short
consisting
usually
of
the
middle
weeks
of
december
when
jack
frost
by
thoughtfully
anticipating
the
snow
allows
of
a
skating
in
the
open
air
before
the
mantle
of
winter
hides
his
handiwork
from
sight
and
use
as
a
natural
consequence
canadians
are
not
remarkable
for
skating
and
two
winters
ago
the
swiftest
fliers
of
our
land
had
to
lower
their
banner
before
axel
paulsen
the
renowned
norwegian
skater
who
made
a
triumphant
tour
through
canada
and
the
united
states
on
the
other
hand
the
long
season
enjoyed
by
the
rinks
enables
all
who
will
take
the
trouble
and
do
not
shrink
from
a
novitiate
of
bumps
and
bruises
to
become
exceedingly
expert
at
fancy
skating
and
it
is
hardly
debatable
that
the
rinks
of
toronto
montreal
halifax
and
john
can
send
forth
skaters
who
for
grace
precision
and
intricacy
of
movement
would
find
no
superiors
in
the
world
when
paulsen
attempted
to
teach
the
canadians
fancy
skating
he
was
somewhat
chagrined
to
find
himself
soon
reduced
to
the
position
of
learner
as
an
he
did
indeed
perform
one
or
two
feats
that
were
novel
but
they
had
only
to
be
seen
to
be
immediately
copied
while
some
of
the
canadians
were
able
to
open
his
eyes
to
possibilities
of
didoes
which
he
thought
it
not
best
to
hurriedly
attempt
his
visit
was
of
permanent
value
however
because
it
awakened
a
deeper
interest
in
skating
and
one
may
safely
venture
to
prophesy
that
should
paulsen
come
this
way
again
he
will
find
the
defeat
of
his
whilom
opponents
at
long
distances
not
quite
such
a
holiday
task
as
on
the
occasion
of
his
last
visit
what
is
known
in
england
as
and
there
very
ardently
indulged
in
by
members
of
the
various
clubs
who
can
afford
to
acquire
the
art
in
norway
or
scotland
is
but
little
practised
in
canada
it
is
not
suitable
for
rinks
as
it
requires
so
much
room
and
can
only
be
done
to
advantage
in
large
open
spaces
which
the
figurists
may
have
all
to
themselves
is
undoubtedly
very
effective
and
striking
when
executed
by
a
band
of
skaters
who
thoroughly
understand
one
another
but
it
is
so
elaborate
and
takes
so
much
time
both
in
preparation
and
performance
that
it
is
not
suited
to
the
latitude
of
a
colony
where
the
majority
of
those
who
skate
have
no
surplus
leisure
and
want
to
make
the
most
of
the
time
at
their
disposal
for
recreation
there
is
one
phase
of
however
which
does
flourish
throughout
wit
dancing
and
it
would
delight
the
heart
of
terpsichore
herself
to
watch
a
quartette
of
couples
gliding
through
the
mazes
of
the
lancers
or
quadrille
or
sweeping
round
in
airy
circles
to
the
music
of
the
waltz
the
evolutions
differ
somewhat
of
course
from
the
steps
taken
on
the
floor
but
the
identity
of
the
dance
is
far
from
being
lost
and
the
pleasure
of
the
dancer
is
greatly
enhanced
through
the
surpassing
ease
of
motion
this
dancing
on
the
ice
may
be
seen
in
its
perfection
at
halifax
the
capital
of
nova
scotia
which
being
a
garrison
city
enjoys
the
unique
privilege
of
military
bands
and
the
officers
as
a
rule
becoming
enthusiastic
skaters
the
ladies
who
grace
the
fashionable
rink
by
their
presence
have
a
grand
time
of
it
gliding
entrancingly
about
to
the
bewitching
strains
of
delightful
music
and
bringing
all
the
artillery
of
their
thrilling
eyes
tempting
cheeks
and
enslaving
lips
to
bear
upon
the
gallant
sons
of
mars
who
oftentimes
find
the
slippery
floor
more
fatal
than
the
tented
field
the
finest
rinks
in
canada
are
those
in
montreal
halifax
and
john
the
rink
at
halifax
is
really
the
crystal
palace
of
the
exhibition
grounds
and
for
size
appearance
and
convenience
is
surpassed
by
none
one
of
the
most
cheerful
sights
imaginable
is
this
vast
building
on
when
the
arena
is
almost
hidden
beneath
a
throng
of
happy
skaters
youths
and
maidens
circling
round
hand
in
maiden
glowing
with
pride
at
her
dexterity
the
youth
enraptured
by
his
roseate
winsomeness
here
doth
cupid
bid
defiance
to
the
chilling
blasts
of
winter
and
although
the
poets
and
painters
have
conspired
to
confine
him
to
a
garb
appropriate
to
the
the
sly
wielder
of
the
fatal
bow
must
in
winter
enwrap
himself
in
furry
garments
and
like
a
tiny
santa
claus
perch
his
chubby
form
unseen
among
the
rafters
and
from
that
coigne
of
vantage
let
fly
his
shafts
thick
and
fast
into
the
merry
company
beneath
one
of
the
chief
attractions
of
skating
for
the
ambitious
disciple
is
that
there
is
practically
no
limit
to
its
possibilities
in
the
way
of
invention
and
combination
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
prepare
for
any
skating
tournament
a
programme
which
would
meet
every
requirement
hence
in
competitions
of
this
kind
the
custom
is
to
lay
down
some
twenty
or
thirty
of
the
feats
which
every
competitor
is
supposed
to
do
and
then
leave
each
contestant
to
superadd
thereto
such
marvels
of
skill
as
he
may
have
picked
up
or
invented
at
the
same
time
of
course
there
may
be
almost
as
many
degrees
of
skill
represented
in
the
execution
of
the
set
programme
as
there
are
competitors
and
the
judges
must
take
this
fully
into
consideration
when
making
their
award
and
not
allow
their
judgment
to
be
dazzled
by
some
particularly
striking
extra
skating
tournaments
however
are
not
as
frequent
as
they
ought
to
be
while
every
other
recognized
sport
has
its
regularly
recurring
trials
of
proficiency
skating
has
hitherto
been
inexplicably
neglected
surely
nothing
could
be
more
interesting
or
attractive
than
a
gathering
of
accomplished
skaters
of
both
sexes
vying
with
one
another
in
the
ease
and
grace
with
which
they
can
illustrate
the
intricacies
of
the
the
difficulty
of
the
giant
swing
or
the
rapidity
of
the
locomotive
trials
of
speed
are
common
enough
at
all
rinks
and
are
undoubtedly
more
popular
and
exciting
than
trials
of
skill
but
the
more
refined
and
less
demoralizing
competition
should
not
be
entirely
neglected
the
speed
attained
by
those
who
race
in
rinks
it
need
hardly
be
explained
affords
no
criterion
whatever
whereby
to
judge
of
what
fast
skaters
are
competent
to
accomplish
the
incessant
turns
the
sharp
corners
the
confined
area
all
tend
to
materially
reduce
the
rate
of
progression
and
only
out
on
some
broad
lake
or
reach
of
river
can
the
skater
do
his
best
i
have
no
records
at
hand
as
i
write
but
my
own
experience
justifies
me
in
venturing
the
assertion
that
a
champion
skater
in
perfect
form
and
properly
equipped
with
racing
skates
would
prove
no
mean
antagonist
for
maud
herself
over
a
measured
mile
while
at
longer
distances
he
would
have
the
field
to
himself
like
all
other
amusements
skating
in
canada
waxes
and
wanes
in
popular
estimation
according
to
the
mysterious
laws
of
human
impulse
one
winter
skating
will
be
voted
not
the
thing
and
the
rinks
will
be
deserted
the
next
they
will
be
crowded
and
even
the
heads
of
families
will
be
fishing
out
their
rusty
acmes
from
the
and
renewing
their
youth
in
the
icy
arena
as
a
means
of
exercise
during
the
long
weary
months
of
winter
when
the
deep
snow
renders
walking
a
toil
devoid
of
pleasure
and
the
muscles
are
aching
for
employment
the
is
an
unspeakable
boon
especially
to
him
whose
lot
it
is
to
endure
much
dry
drudgery
at
the
dead
wood
an
brisk
spinning
around
will
clear
the
befogged
brain
brace
up
the
lax
frame
and
give
a
keenness
to
the
appetite
that
nothing
else
could
do
then
the
rink
has
its
social
as
well
as
its
sanitary
advantages
during
the
winter
months
it
affords
both
sexes
a
pleasant
and
convenient
rendezvous
where
unhampered
by
the
conventionalities
of
the
and
aided
by
the
cheerful
inspiration
of
the
exercise
they
can
enjoy
one
society
with
a
frequency
otherwise
unattainable
on
indeed
the
rink
becomes
converted
into
a
spacious
where
the
numbered
programme
of
musical
selections
enables
corydon
to
make
engagements
in
advance
with
phyllis
and
thus
insure
the
prosperous
prosecution
of
his
suit
a
carnival
on
every
rink
has
one
or
more
during
the
a
rarely
interesting
and
brilliant
spectacle
for
these
occasions
the
building
dons
its
gala
dress
the
gaunt
rafters
are
hung
with
banners
the
walls
are
hidden
beneath
variegated
bunting
and
festooned
with
spruce
embroidery
lights
gleam
brightly
from
every
nook
and
corner
and
the
ice
is
prepared
with
special
care
then
as
the
motley
crowd
glides
swiftly
by
one
may
behold
representatives
of
every
clime
and
nation
mingling
together
in
perfect
amity
it
is
true
the
tawny
spaniard
the
italian
the
impassive
turk
the
appalling
zulu
the
soft
and
silent
hindu
and
others
whose
home
lies
beneath
the
southern
skies
betray
a
familiarity
with
the
ice
which
seems
to
cast
some
doubt
upon
its
genuineness
but
when
his
satanic
majesty
himself
with
barbed
tail
and
cloven
hoof
confesses
to
an
intimacy
with
the
mazy
evolutions
of
the
philadelphia
the
incongruity
attaching
to
visitors
from
cooler
climes
appears
less
striking
and
they
may
go
on
their
way
unchallenged
sometimes
masks
are
at
these
carnivals
and
then
the
inevitable
clown
and
harlequin
have
unlimited
license
till
even
quakers
and
friars
infected
by
their
bad
example
vie
with
them
in
mad
pranks
and
the
fun
soon
waxes
furious
masked
or
unmasked
the
carnival
skaters
have
a
joyous
time
and
the
hours
steal
away
with
cruel
haste
such
are
some
of
the
phases
of
in
canada
if
this
article
has
seemed
to
be
devoted
principally
to
indoor
skating
it
is
because
that
can
be
pursued
through
so
much
greater
a
portion
of
the
winter
than
the
outdoor
kind
skating
in
its
perfection
is
of
course
only
to
be
had
in
the
open
air
and
my
most
delightful
recollections
are
associated
with
the
dartmouth
lakes
of
happy
memory
connected
with
the
same
lakes
however
there
is
a
recollection
too
thrilling
to
be
delightful
and
which
in
view
of
what
might
have
been
brings
a
shudder
even
now
while
i
rehearse
it
it
happened
in
my
college
days
i
had
been
skating
all
the
afternoon
and
as
the
dusk
grew
on
apace
found
myself
away
down
at
the
head
of
the
second
lake
full
six
miles
from
the
point
where
i
had
got
on
the
ice
so
girding
up
my
loins
i
set
my
face
towards
home
and
struck
out
lustily
after
going
about
one
hundred
yards
i
thought
i
heard
the
sound
of
my
name
come
faintly
to
me
over
the
ice
wheeling
sharply
about
i
saw
nothing
except
a
dark
form
some
distance
away
which
through
the
gathering
gloom
resembled
a
log
or
and
i
was
just
about
to
start
off
again
when
once
more
my
name
was
called
this
time
so
clearly
as
to
leave
no
chance
for
doubt
the
sound
evidently
coming
from
the
seeming
log
hastening
over
to
it
with
all
speed
i
was
startled
to
find
the
professor
of
classics
at
my
did
not
allow
the
loss
of
an
arm
to
debar
him
from
the
pleasure
of
on
the
ice
with
his
left
leg
broken
sharp
and
clear
a
few
inches
above
the
ankle
the
result
of
a
sudden
and
heavy
fall
here
indeed
was
a
trying
situation
for
a
mere
lad
to
cope
with
we
were
alone
in
a
wilderness
of
ice
and
six
miles
away
from
the
nearest
house
the
shadows
of
night
were
fast
closing
around
us
those
six
miles
had
to
be
gotten
over
in
some
way
and
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
hurrying
to
the
shore
i
cut
down
a
small
spruce
tree
upon
this
the
helpless
sufferer
was
laid
as
gently
as
possible
and
bound
to
it
with
straps
then
upon
this
rude
ambulance
i
slowly
dragged
him
down
the
lake
while
he
with
splendid
instead
of
murmuring
at
his
terrible
agony
charmed
away
my
weariness
by
his
unconquerable
heroism
it
was
a
toilsome
task
but
help
came
when
we
reached
the
first
lake
and
once
the
shore
was
gained
a
long
express
waggon
filled
with
mattresses
made
the
homeward
journey
comparatively
painless
all
is
well
that
ends
well
the
broken
leg
soon
mended
and
the
following
winter
found
the
professor
skating
as
briskly
as
ever
yet
i
can
not
help
wondering
sometimes
with
a
shudder
how
it
would
have
fared
with
the
interpreter
of
greece
and
rome
had
not
that
first
faint
call
reached
my
ears
a
bitter
cold
night
a
wide
expanse
of
polished
ice
a
solitary
man
lying
prone
upon
it
with
one
arm
missing
at
the
shoulder
and
one
leg
broken
at
the
were
little
less
than
a
miracle
if
in
canada
had
not
been
clouded
by
one
more
catastrophe
that
winter
night
wild
dogs
of
athabasca
old
donald
was
a
wonderfully
interesting
character
in
the
service
of
the
hudson
bay
company
which
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
held
regal
sway
over
the
vast
unknown
of
canada
he
had
spent
half
a
century
of
arduous
and
exciting
service
living
far
away
from
civilization
one
of
a
mere
handful
of
white
men
in
the
midst
of
a
wilderness
sparsely
inhabited
by
the
indian
and
the
but
abounding
in
deer
buffaloes
bears
wolves
and
the
smaller
wild
animals
he
had
risen
rapidly
in
the
service
for
he
was
a
fearless
stanch
trustworthy
man
and
for
the
latter
half
of
two
terms
had
filled
the
important
post
of
chief
factor
at
different
forts
for
it
was
his
somewhat
undesirable
if
honourable
lot
to
be
sent
to
those
stations
that
gave
the
most
trouble
and
the
least
returns
to
the
company
such
was
his
reputation
for
shrewdness
courage
and
fidelity
that
it
was
felt
by
the
authorities
that
no
other
man
could
so
soon
set
matters
straight
as
donald
having
filled
out
his
fifty
years
with
entire
satisfaction
to
his
employers
and
no
small
credit
to
himself
he
had
retired
on
his
laurels
to
spend
a
hale
and
hearty
old
age
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
comfortable
pension
awarded
him
by
the
company
which
he
had
served
so
well
it
was
the
delight
of
his
declining
days
to
recount
for
the
benefit
of
younger
ears
the
many
thrilling
incidents
of
his
adventurous
career
and
one
of
his
favourite
stories
was
that
which
i
shall
now
attempt
to
tell
as
nearly
as
possible
in
his
own
words
it
was
early
in
the
fifties
when
i
had
charge
of
old
fort
assiniboine
away
out
on
the
athabasca
river
not
far
from
the
rockies
sir
george
simpson
the
governor
of
the
colony
at
red
river
like
the
thoughtful
man
he
was
had
sent
out
to
me
by
the
spring
brigade
a
splendid
scotch
one
of
he
had
just
brought
with
him
from
the
dear
old
land
o
man
but
he
was
a
dog
his
back
was
on
a
level
with
my
belt
and
when
he
raised
himself
on
his
hind
legs
he
could
put
his
fore
paws
on
my
shoulders
and
rub
noses
with
me
yet
i
stood
a
good
six
feet
in
my
stockings
in
those
days
his
hair
was
as
grizzled
as
old
and
coarse
and
curled
like
what
they
stuff
beds
with
his
body
was
long
and
lean
and
so
was
his
head
but
he
had
a
noble
eye
and
then
the
way
he
could
run
and
leap
over
everything
that
came
in
his
path
it
was
a
sight
to
see
i
warrant
you
we
soon
got
very
much
attached
to
each
other
and
wherever
i
went
bruce
went
too
he
did
not
seem
to
take
to
any
one
else
and
i
was
just
as
well
pleased
that
he
did
not
for
i
never
wanted
him
out
of
my
sight
that
same
summer
a
new
hand
was
sent
to
the
fort
he
was
an
englishman
who
gave
his
name
as
heathcote
and
he
brought
with
him
a
pure
white
female
that
was
one
of
the
most
brutes
i
ever
laid
eyes
on
she
minded
nobody
but
her
master
of
whom
to
do
her
credit
she
seemed
fond
enough
i
never
much
cared
for
that
breed
of
dog
but
i
must
say
vixen
was
about
perfect
in
her
way
as
to
there
certainly
much
to
choose
between
her
and
bruce
i
was
a
little
uneasy
as
to
how
the
two
dogs
would
get
on
and
at
first
it
did
look
as
if
there
might
be
trouble
for
bruce
who
utterly
despised
the
rabble
of
curs
hanging
about
the
fort
evidently
felt
disposed
to
resent
the
coming
of
this
possible
rival
but
almost
before
i
knew
it
the
two
were
the
best
of
friends
and
would
eat
their
dinner
side
by
side
like
two
children
after
a
while
they
took
to
going
out
together
and
grand
times
they
had
they
would
work
along
in
company
until
a
herd
of
deer
was
started
and
then
bruce
would
make
for
the
fattest
doe
his
tremendous
speed
soon
bringing
him
to
her
throat
while
vixen
following
at
her
best
rate
would
come
up
just
in
time
to
help
him
to
finish
her
and
then
they
would
have
a
fine
feast
once
the
dogs
got
into
these
ways
neither
heathcote
nor
i
had
much
more
satisfaction
out
of
them
they
were
never
on
hand
when
wanted
they
kept
growing
wilder
and
wilder
and
finally
toward
autumn
they
disappeared
one
day
and
were
never
seen
at
the
fort
again
we
hunted
for
them
high
and
low
sending
out
the
as
far
as
lake
la
crosse
on
the
east
and
to
the
of
the
rockies
on
the
west
but
not
a
sign
or
trace
could
we
find
of
them
when
winter
came
and
they
did
not
return
we
gave
them
up
as
lost
thinking
that
something
must
have
happened
to
them
on
one
of
their
hunting
forays
or
that
perchance
they
had
been
killed
by
the
indians
two
years
went
by
and
bruce
and
vixen
were
almost
forgotten
when
stories
began
to
reach
the
fort
of
a
strange
and
fierce
kind
of
wild
dog
that
was
being
seen
now
and
then
by
hunters
and
trappers
in
the
valleys
and
ravines
of
the
it
was
not
an
easy
job
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
these
stories
for
they
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
before
reaching
us
but
at
last
a
trapper
turned
up
who
had
seen
a
pack
of
the
dogs
himself
and
after
hearing
his
description
i
had
no
longer
any
doubt
but
that
these
wild
dogs
which
were
making
such
a
stir
were
the
offspring
of
our
two
former
pets
which
had
gone
away
in
company
by
all
accounts
they
were
evidently
dangerous
brutes
to
meet
from
bruce
they
had
got
wonderful
speed
and
endurance
from
vixen
ferocity
and
fearlessness
swift
savage
stubborn
and
always
going
in
large
packs
there
was
not
an
animal
on
the
plains
or
up
among
the
mountains
for
which
they
were
not
more
than
a
match
i
felt
eager
to
get
a
sight
of
the
creatures
even
though
it
should
mean
some
risk
for
while
like
all
wild
dogs
willing
enough
to
give
men
a
wide
berth
there
was
no
telling
what
they
might
do
if
pressed
by
hunger
it
was
therefore
good
news
when
a
year
later
orders
came
from
red
river
for
me
to
make
a
trip
to
fort
george
on
the
other
side
of
the
rockies
where
there
were
some
matters
that
needed
straightening
up
as
either
going
or
coming
back
i
would
run
a
good
chance
of
seeing
something
of
the
famous
dogs
i
left
fort
assiniboine
in
the
autumn
and
although
a
sharp
was
kept
by
all
the
party
as
we
went
over
to
fort
george
not
a
sight
nor
sign
of
the
dogs
did
we
stumble
upon
but
on
my
way
back
in
the
spring
i
had
better
luck
and
i
certainly
shall
never
forget
my
first
and
last
sight
of
those
terrible
brutes
we
had
crossed
the
rockies
and
were
descending
the
eastern
slopes
getting
down
among
the
one
day
heathcote
and
i
pushed
on
together
in
advance
of
the
rest
both
of
us
having
the
dogs
on
our
mind
early
in
the
afternoon
we
came
to
a
bluff
that
overlooked
a
lovely
little
valley
which
we
at
once
decided
would
be
our
for
that
night
a
bright
stream
ran
along
the
centre
of
the
valley
having
a
thought
that
perhaps
a
herd
of
deer
might
put
in
an
appearance
if
we
kept
out
of
sight
wo
stretched
ourselves
out
comfortably
on
the
bluff
and
awaited
developments
they
proved
to
be
interesting
beyond
all
our
expectations
we
had
been
there
about
an
hour
perhaps
when
heathcote
who
had
been
looking
over
at
the
opposite
bluff
suddenly
grasped
my
arm
saying
under
his
there
what
do
you
think
of
that
illustration
again
and
again
would
the
bear
rising
on
his
hind
quarters
hurl
the
dogs
from
him
a
break
in
the
bluff
had
made
a
sort
of
easy
descent
into
the
valley
and
down
this
were
coming
in
single
file
one
two
three
less
than
a
dozen
bears
of
the
large
and
dreaded
kind
splendid
fellows
most
of
them
bent
on
having
a
good
time
on
the
sunny
slopes
beside
the
stream
we
hardly
dared
to
stir
or
breathe
to
have
attacked
them
would
have
been
utter
madness
thankful
might
we
be
if
we
could
crawl
away
without
their
attacking
us
while
lying
there
motionless
and
wishing
to
the
bottom
of
our
hearts
that
the
rest
of
the
party
were
on
hand
to
make
matters
even
a
fierce
bark
came
from
the
bluff
a
little
above
where
the
bears
first
showed
themselves
it
was
followed
by
a
whole
chorus
of
baying
and
an
instant
later
there
rushed
into
view
fairly
tumbling
over
one
another
in
their
impetuous
haste
a
great
pack
of
dogs
that
we
at
once
recognized
as
those
we
wished
to
see
they
were
certainly
a
fearsome
lot
of
creatures
some
were
long
lean
and
shaggy
like
bruce
others
were
and
smooth
of
hair
like
vixen
all
were
powerful
brutes
a
dozen
of
whom
might
eat
a
buffalo
for
dinner
without
feeling
uncomfortably
overloaded
after
their
meal
they
sighted
the
bears
the
moment
they
reached
the
edge
of
the
bluff
and
at
once
rushed
down
to
the
attack
barking
as
though
they
would
split
their
throats
the
bears
made
ready
to
receive
them
by
massing
together
at
the
top
of
a
little
knoll
near
the
water
and
before
we
could
fully
realize
what
was
taking
place
the
fight
had
begun
so
far
as
we
could
make
out
the
dogs
numbered
fifty
at
least
so
that
considering
their
size
and
strength
the
odds
were
a
good
deal
in
their
favour
but
the
bears
fought
like
heroes
at
first
they
crowded
together
in
a
sort
of
circle
with
heads
facing
out
while
the
dogs
ran
round
them
snarling
and
barking
and
watching
their
chance
to
spring
a
few
moments
later
the
circle
was
broken
up
into
a
dozen
roaring
writhing
yelping
groups
composed
of
a
bear
with
four
or
five
of
the
dogs
clinging
tenaciously
to
different
parts
of
its
body
it
was
the
vixen
strain
that
told
now
again
and
again
would
the
bear
rising
on
his
hind
quarters
hurl
the
dogs
from
him
with
mighty
sweeps
of
his
huge
fore
paws
only
to
be
penned
at
once
and
brought
to
the
ground
by
a
fresh
attack
at
frequent
intervals
an
agonizing
would
pierce
its
way
through
the
horrible
clamour
as
some
unfortunate
dog
caught
in
the
grasp
of
its
maddened
enemy
would
be
crushed
to
death
in
his
resistless
embrace
the
minutes
slipped
by
and
the
fight
still
raged
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
how
it
would
result
the
dogs
had
the
best
of
it
as
to
numbers
and
they
were
the
equals
of
the
bears
in
courage
ferocity
and
endurance
if
not
in
sheer
strength
one
by
one
the
big
brown
bodies
rolled
over
in
the
stillness
of
death
at
the
end
of
about
the
fight
was
over
not
a
bear
breathed
and
around
their
torn
carcasses
lay
between
twenty
and
thirty
of
the
dogs
as
dead
as
best
possible
proof
of
how
fiercely
and
obstinately
they
had
fought
not
a
word
had
passed
between
heathcote
and
myself
while
all
this
went
on
we
were
too
much
taken
up
with
the
extraordinary
conflict
going
on
before
our
eyes
even
to
look
at
each
other
but
when
it
was
all
over
and
the
surviving
dogs
having
satisfied
themselves
that
the
bears
were
really
all
dead
lay
down
to
lick
their
many
wounds
before
they
began
upon
the
feast
their
brave
victims
had
provided
for
them
i
touched
heathcote
on
the
shoulder
and
whispered
seen
the
dogs
take
good
care
they
see
after
such
a
proof
of
their
powers
as
we
had
had
we
were
in
no
mind
to
claim
a
nearer
acquaintance
with
them
on
the
score
of
having
once
owned
their
ancestors
accordingly
we
crawled
noiselessly
away
and
making
a
long
circuit
rejoined
our
party
in
time
to
prevent
their
turning
down
into
the
valley
which
we
no
longer
considered
a
good
place
to
camp
in
for
the
night
that
was
my
first
and
last
sight
of
the
wild
dogs
of
athabasca
the
following
autumn
i
went
east
and
never
returned
to
fort
assiniboine
whether
the
dogs
have
since
been
all
killed
off
or
are
still
running
wild
among
the
far
recesses
of
the
rockies
i
know
but
that
wonderful
battle
in
the
valley
was
one
of
the
greatest
sights
of
my
life
the
like
of
which
no
one
perhaps
will
ever
again
see
on
this
continent
and
beasts
on
sable
island
if
you
will
take
your
atlas
and
turn
to
the
map
of
canada
you
may
by
looking
very
carefully
discover
a
small
spot
in
the
atlantic
ocean
almost
due
east
from
nova
scotia
and
close
beside
the
sixtieth
parallel
of
longitude
this
little
lonely
spot
is
sable
island
there
it
lies
in
the
midst
of
the
waves
a
long
low
bank
of
gray
sand
without
a
single
tree
upon
it
from
end
to
end
nay
not
so
much
as
a
bush
behind
which
a
baby
might
play
it
seems
therefore
at
first
sight
to
be
one
of
the
most
unfavourable
places
in
the
world
for
the
study
of
either
birds
or
beasts
yet
strange
as
it
may
seem
this
island
which
is
now
but
twenty
miles
long
and
at
its
greatest
breadth
but
a
mile
and
a
half
it
was
quite
double
that
a
wonderfully
interesting
history
of
its
own
of
which
not
the
least
entertaining
chapter
is
that
relating
to
its
furry
and
feathered
inhabitants
although
when
first
viewed
from
the
sea
sable
island
appears
to
be
nothing
better
than
a
barren
on
closer
acquaintance
it
reveals
inside
its
sloping
beaches
vales
and
meadows
that
in
seem
like
bits
out
of
a
western
prairie
there
are
green
grassy
knolls
and
enchanting
dells
with
placid
ponds
in
their
midst
and
if
you
only
come
at
the
right
time
and
stay
long
enough
you
may
gather
pink
roses
blue
lilies
china
asters
wild
pea
gay
and
what
is
still
better
strawberries
blueberries
and
cranberries
in
bountiful
profusion
our
concern
at
present
however
is
not
with
the
fruits
and
flowers
but
with
the
fur
and
feathers
of
this
curious
place
seeing
that
sable
island
has
no
trees
on
the
branches
of
which
nests
may
be
built
it
follows
naturally
that
its
winged
inhabitants
are
altogether
of
the
and
variety
all
over
the
sides
and
tops
of
the
which
rise
to
the
height
of
thirty
forty
or
fifty
feet
the
gulls
gannets
terns
and
other
aquatic
birds
scrape
together
their
miserable
apologies
for
nests
and
hatch
out
their
ugly
little
squab
chicks
making
such
a
about
the
business
that
the
whole
air
is
filled
with
their
chattering
clanging
and
screaming
they
are
indeed
very
disagreeable
neighbours
for
besides
the
horrid
din
they
are
ceaselessly
making
they
are
the
most
untidy
not
to
say
filthy
of
housekeepers
after
they
have
occupied
their
as
their
might
appropriately
be
called
for
a
few
weeks
the
odour
the
wind
bears
from
that
direction
could
never
be
mistaken
for
one
of
those
spicy
breezes
which
are
reputed
to
blow
soft
isle
then
they
have
not
the
redeeming
quality
of
being
fit
to
eat
for
unless
one
were
on
the
very
edge
of
starvation
one
taste
of
their
flesh
rank
with
suggestions
of
fish
and
would
be
sufficient
to
banish
all
appetite
they
have
one
or
two
good
qualities
they
are
brave
for
at
the
peril
of
their
lives
they
will
dauntlessly
attack
any
rash
intruder
upon
their
domains
swooping
down
upon
him
with
sharp
cries
and
still
sharper
beaks
their
movements
illustrate
the
poetry
of
motion
as
they
come
sailing
grandly
in
from
the
ocean
spaces
and
circle
about
their
own
particular
hillock
in
glorious
dips
and
curves
and
mountings
upward
that
fill
the
human
observer
with
longing
and
envy
much
more
satisfactory
however
are
the
black
duck
sheldrake
plover
curlew
and
snipe
which
nest
by
uncounted
thousands
in
the
dense
grass
that
girts
the
ponds
and
afford
dainty
dishes
for
the
table
it
is
easy
work
to
make
a
fine
bag
on
a
favourable
day
and
grand
sport
may
be
had
by
any
one
who
knows
how
to
handle
a
many
are
the
interesting
stories
connected
with
bird
life
on
sable
island
but
a
single
one
and
that
the
oddest
of
them
all
must
suffice
i
give
it
upon
the
unimpeachable
authority
of
bernard
gilpin
about
forty
years
or
more
ago
a
lot
of
rabbits
were
sent
there
as
an
experiment
the
idea
was
if
they
prospered
to
furnish
the
human
inhabitants
of
the
island
with
a
pleasant
variety
from
the
salt
junk
which
generally
adorned
their
tables
the
experiment
succeeded
admirably
bunny
found
the
firm
dry
sands
just
the
thing
for
his
burrows
while
the
abundant
wild
pea
and
other
herbage
furnished
unstinted
food
for
his
prolific
brood
but
one
fateful
day
in
dark
day
in
the
annals
of
big
snowy
owl
that
had
somehow
lost
his
bearings
and
been
driven
out
to
sea
by
a
westerly
gale
dropped
wearily
upon
the
island
to
rest
his
tired
pinions
while
sitting
on
a
thankful
at
his
escape
from
a
watery
grave
he
looked
about
him
and
to
his
amazed
delight
all
sights
the
most
welcome
in
the
world
to
a
hungry
rabbits
young
and
rabbits
old
rabbits
plump
and
rabbits
lean
rabbits
in
sixes
and
rabbits
in
sevens
were
frisking
about
in
the
long
grass
and
over
the
sand
merrily
innocent
of
their
peril
at
first
sir
owl
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
for
it
was
a
bright
sunny
day
and
owls
can
not
see
very
well
when
the
sun
is
shining
but
presently
as
he
still
squatted
on
the
sand
perfectly
motionless
except
his
eyelids
blinking
solemnly
a
thoughtless
little
rabbit
which
had
grown
too
much
excited
over
a
game
of
chase
with
his
brother
to
look
where
he
was
going
ran
up
against
the
bewildered
bird
this
awoke
the
owl
thoroughly
with
a
quick
spring
that
sent
all
the
other
little
scampering
off
to
their
burrows
in
wild
affright
he
fastened
his
long
claws
in
the
back
of
his
unfortunate
disturber
and
without
even
stopping
to
say
grace
made
a
dinner
off
him
on
the
spot
that
was
a
day
in
the
calendar
thenceforth
he
revelled
in
rabbit
for
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
and
had
he
been
a
very
greedy
owl
might
have
kept
his
discovery
of
a
rabbit
bonanza
all
to
himself
but
he
with
a
splendid
unselfishness
which
some
bipeds
without
feathers
might
advantageously
imitate
he
had
no
sooner
recruited
his
strength
than
off
he
posted
to
the
mainland
to
spread
the
good
news
four
days
later
he
came
back
but
not
alone
this
time
bearing
him
company
were
his
brothers
his
sisters
his
cousins
his
uncles
and
his
aunts
in
such
numbers
that
ere
the
summer
ended
there
was
not
a
solitary
bunny
left
upon
the
island
since
then
the
place
has
been
restocked
and
there
having
been
no
return
of
the
owls
the
rabbits
despite
the
fact
that
great
numbers
of
them
are
killed
for
food
have
so
multiplied
as
to
become
a
positive
nuisance
and
the
experience
of
australia
being
in
view
the
advisability
of
their
extermination
is
seriously
considered
besides
the
rabbits
there
have
been
at
different
times
the
following
animals
upon
sable
the
black
fox
white
bear
walrus
and
seals
wild
horses
cattle
and
swine
rats
cats
and
dogs
that
makes
quite
a
long
list
of
course
so
small
and
bare
an
island
could
never
have
held
them
all
at
once
now
they
are
all
gone
except
the
rabbits
the
horses
of
which
several
hundreds
still
scamper
wild
over
the
sand
dunes
and
the
seals
which
come
every
year
to
introduce
their
shiny
little
whelps
into
the
world
and
to
grow
fat
on
the
fish
hurled
continually
upon
the
beach
by
the
tireless
breakers
it
is
a
great
many
years
since
the
black
fox
white
bear
and
walrus
were
last
seen
upon
the
island
too
much
money
could
be
made
out
of
them
when
dead
for
the
fishermen
who
knew
of
their
presence
to
let
them
live
long
and
so
with
powder
and
shot
and
steel
they
were
ruthlessly
exterminated
the
beautiful
skins
of
the
black
fox
worth
one
hundred
golden
crowns
each
went
principally
to
france
where
they
were
made
up
into
splendid
robes
for
royalty
just
how
the
wild
horses
and
cattle
found
their
way
to
sable
island
is
not
positively
known
they
were
first
heard
of
in
those
early
days
when
ships
loaded
with
cattle
grain
and
farming
utensils
were
coming
over
in
little
fleets
from
europe
to
help
to
settle
america
in
all
likelihood
some
of
these
vessels
got
cast
away
on
the
it
has
ever
been
a
dreadful
place
for
in
some
way
the
animals
managed
to
scramble
safe
ashore
and
thus
the
place
became
populated
the
wild
cattle
disappeared
early
in
the
century
but
the
horses
or
rather
ponies
are
still
there
and
very
interesting
creatures
they
are
winter
and
summer
they
are
out
on
the
sand
in
all
weathers
indeed
they
scorn
to
go
under
cover
even
in
the
wildest
storms
and
although
shelters
have
been
built
for
them
they
will
not
deign
to
enter
them
another
curious
thing
about
them
is
that
they
are
never
seen
to
lie
down
and
apparently
go
to
sleep
standing
there
are
now
about
four
hundred
of
these
ponies
divided
into
troops
each
under
the
charge
and
control
of
an
old
stallion
whose
shaggy
unkempt
mane
and
tail
sweep
the
ground
as
he
stands
sentinel
over
his
numerous
family
they
belong
to
the
dominion
government
and
it
has
been
usual
to
cull
out
some
forty
or
fifty
of
the
best
of
them
each
year
and
send
them
up
to
halifax
where
they
command
good
prices
they
are
stanch
sturdy
little
animals
and
very
serviceable
when
properly
broken
in
my
boyhood
days
i
rejoiced
in
the
possession
of
a
fine
bay
that
barring
a
provoking
habit
of
pitching
an
unwary
rider
over
his
head
was
a
great
source
of
enjoyment
the
manner
of
catching
the
ponies
is
for
a
number
of
mounted
men
to
surround
a
band
and
drive
it
into
a
corral
in
which
a
tame
pony
has
been
placed
as
a
decoy
this
is
often
a
very
exciting
experience
the
cracking
of
whips
shouting
of
men
neighing
of
ponies
combine
with
the
plunging
of
the
frightened
captives
and
the
gallant
charges
of
the
enraged
stallions
to
make
up
a
scene
not
readily
forgotten
once
safely
corraled
the
best
males
are
picked
out
and
lassoed
and
the
rest
turned
loose
to
breathe
the
salt
air
of
freedom
once
more
as
the
breed
has
been
observed
to
be
degenerating
greatly
of
late
years
means
have
been
taken
to
improve
it
and
it
is
probable
that
ere
long
sable
island
ponies
will
be
more
desirable
than
ever
a
very
amusing
thing
in
connection
with
animal
life
on
sable
island
is
the
story
of
the
rats
cats
and
dogs
first
of
all
were
the
rats
who
are
reputed
to
be
very
clever
about
deserting
sinking
ships
and
who
here
found
plenty
of
opportunity
to
show
their
cleverness
for
wrecks
are
always
happening
they
thus
became
so
plentiful
that
they
threatened
to
eat
the
human
inhabitants
out
of
house
and
home
indeed
they
did
make
them
do
without
bread
for
three
whole
months
upon
one
occasion
this
state
of
things
of
course
could
not
be
tolerated
a
large
number
of
cats
were
accordingly
imported
and
they
soon
cleared
the
premises
of
the
rapacious
rodents
but
it
was
not
long
ere
the
pussies
in
their
turn
grew
so
numerous
wild
and
fierce
as
to
become
a
source
of
serious
trouble
a
small
army
of
dogs
was
therefore
brought
upon
the
scene
and
they
made
short
work
of
the
cats
thus
rounding
out
a
very
curious
cycle
did
space
permit
i
could
tell
something
about
the
seals
and
their
very
quaint
and
attractive
ways
and
manners
but
perhaps
enough
has
been
already
written
to
convince
readers
that
however
lonely
barren
and
insignificant
sable
island
may
seem
it
has
an
interesting
story
of
its
own
which
is
well
worth
the
telling
bore
of
minas
basin
upon
the
side
of
one
of
the
rounded
hills
that
rise
up
gently
from
the
wonderful
sea
of
verdure
which
longfellow
without
ever
looking
upon
it
for
himself
immortalized
in
his
evangeline
acacia
villa
nestled
cozily
in
the
midst
of
many
trees
long
lines
of
poplars
stood
up
and
down
the
house
front
and
marked
out
the
garden
boundaries
furnishing
abundant
supplies
of
peppers
for
the
boys
in
and
better
still
a
whole
regiment
of
apple
and
pear
trees
marshalled
itself
at
the
back
filling
the
hearts
and
mouths
of
both
young
and
old
with
delight
in
the
autumn
when
the
boughs
bent
so
temptingly
beneath
their
burden
of
fruitage
there
could
hardly
be
a
more
attractive
location
for
a
and
seeing
what
comfortable
quarters
thomson
provided
and
how
thoroughly
he
understood
the
business
of
teaching
it
was
no
wonder
that
boys
came
not
only
from
all
parts
of
nova
scotia
and
new
brunswick
but
even
from
the
united
states
to
be
grounded
in
classics
mathematics
and
literature
under
his
direction
the
last
boarder
left
acacia
villa
long
ago
but
twenty
years
back
its
dormitories
were
filled
to
their
utmost
capacity
with
lads
of
all
ages
and
sizes
and
the
whole
neighbourhood
felt
the
stirring
influence
of
twoscore
lively
hearty
noisy
boys
in
its
midst
for
nearly
ten
months
out
of
the
year
the
school
was
like
a
hive
of
bees
in
term
beginning
in
september
and
finishing
in
june
it
was
coming
on
toward
midsummer
now
and
excitement
ran
high
throughout
the
school
for
while
the
drones
were
looking
forward
longingly
to
the
holidays
which
would
release
them
from
all
horrid
for
a
couple
of
months
the
workers
were
even
more
eagerly
expecting
the
final
examinations
when
books
bats
balls
knives
and
other
things
dear
to
the
heart
were
offered
by
wise
thomson
to
the
boys
who
came
out
ahead
in
the
different
branches
of
study
the
two
boys
strolling
down
toward
the
river
this
fine
summer
afternoon
were
good
representatives
of
the
two
hamilton
being
one
of
the
brightest
and
most
ambitious
as
tom
peters
or
buntie
in
the
saucy
slang
of
his
schoolmates
was
one
of
the
dullest
and
least
aspiring
in
the
school
yet
somehow
or
other
they
had
been
great
chums
ever
since
they
came
by
the
same
coach
to
the
villa
two
years
before
one
could
easily
understand
that
lazy
buntie
should
find
much
to
admire
and
love
in
handsome
manly
clever
frank
who
was
indeed
a
born
leader
but
just
what
frank
found
in
tom
to
make
him
so
fond
of
him
puzzled
everybody
from
thomson
down
in
whatever
lay
the
secret
the
fact
was
clear
that
the
boys
loved
each
other
like
brothers
and
the
master
who
delighted
in
classical
allusions
used
to
greet
them
as
damon
and
pythias
when
he
encountered
them
together
they
were
discussing
the
approaching
examinations
and
speculating
as
to
the
prizes
thomson
would
offer
this
year
no
apples
for
me
on
that
tree
said
tom
adding
with
rather
a
rueful
smile
if
thomson
would
only
offer
a
prize
for
the
most
lickings
and
impositions
i
guess
run
the
best
chance
for
it
never
mind
old
boy
said
frank
consolingly
you
cut
out
for
a
scholar
clear
but
come
out
all
right
at
something
else
and
perhaps
make
a
bigger
name
than
even
himself
although
it
do
to
let
him
hear
you
say
so
have
a
poor
sight
to
beat
yankee
at
anything
answered
tom
but
say
frank
how
do
you
feel
about
giving
him
the
for
the
starr
prize
it
break
my
heart
if
you
come
out
first
well
to
tell
the
truth
buntie
i
feel
any
too
cocky
about
it
a
tough
customer
to
beat
replied
frank
but
hush
coming
right
behind
us
must
be
going
down
to
the
river
too
though
more
like
him
to
stick
in
his
room
and
grind
and
as
a
tall
slight
lad
of
about
sixteen
went
past
them
without
exchange
of
greetings
the
two
friends
stopped
talking
and
went
on
in
silence
yankee
was
the
nickname
given
to
one
of
the
american
boys
at
the
school
he
had
been
thus
distinguished
because
both
in
face
and
figure
he
bore
some
resemblance
to
the
typical
uncle
sam
being
longer
leaner
and
sallower
than
any
of
his
companions
he
was
of
a
quiet
reserved
disposition
and
had
few
friends
indeed
he
did
not
seem
to
desire
many
but
kept
very
much
to
himself
so
that
a
lot
of
the
boys
disliked
him
yet
on
the
other
hand
others
respected
although
they
might
not
love
him
for
not
only
did
he
divide
with
frank
hamilton
whom
they
all
worshipped
the
highest
honours
in
scholarship
but
once
when
scarlet
fever
broke
out
and
seized
upon
six
of
the
smallest
boys
before
they
could
escape
to
their
homes
yankee
or
to
give
him
his
proper
name
emory
haynes
although
he
had
never
had
the
fever
himself
stayed
with
thomson
through
many
anxious
weeks
and
watched
night
after
night
by
the
bedsides
showing
such
tact
and
devotion
as
a
nurse
that
the
doctor
said
at
least
two
of
the
boys
would
never
have
been
saved
from
death
had
it
not
been
for
his
help
walking
with
a
rapid
almost
impatient
step
that
was
characteristic
of
him
emory
haynes
passed
the
two
friends
all
three
directing
their
course
toward
the
gaspereaux
river
which
cuts
a
wide
red
gash
through
the
grand
pré
before
adding
its
turbid
torrent
to
the
tossing
waters
of
minas
basin
if
yankee
beats
me
for
the
starr
prize
it
will
be
the
biggest
disappointment
of
my
life
continued
frank
not
every
day
that
a
fellow
can
get
hold
of
five
pounds
in
bright
big
gold
pieces
and
father
has
promised
if
i
win
it
to
chip
in
as
much
more
and
buy
me
a
splendid
boat
o
frank
sure
to
get
it
yankee
works
like
a
slave
to
be
sure
but
he
half
as
good
a
head
on
him
answered
tom
confidently
not
by
any
means
certain
of
that
tom
just
see
how
easily
he
gets
through
his
mathematics
sure
to
beat
me
on
that
and
have
to
make
up
for
it
by
beating
him
in
classics
anyhow
it
is
no
use
worrying
about
it
now
hurry
up
and
have
a
dip
so
dropping
the
subject
the
two
boys
ran
off
at
a
rate
that
soon
brought
them
to
the
river
bank
here
a
lovely
picture
awaited
them
from
their
feet
the
red
banks
of
clay
and
sand
stretched
hundreds
of
yards
away
for
the
tide
was
out
until
they
were
lapped
by
the
river
now
shrunk
into
a
narrow
sluggish
stream
to
right
and
left
and
beyond
the
river
the
wide
level
marsh
lands
redeemed
from
the
water
by
the
patient
toil
of
the
acadians
were
in
verdure
that
swayed
in
long
lines
of
light
and
shadow
before
the
summer
breeze
not
far
off
began
the
great
dikes
that
sweep
clear
round
the
outer
edge
of
the
grand
pre
the
only
elevation
on
all
that
vast
plain
and
now
waving
to
their
summits
with
grass
behind
them
the
hills
rose
gently
in
fold
upon
fold
their
broad
shoulders
flecked
with
frequent
patches
of
golden
grain
or
the
dark
foliage
of
the
orchards
while
over
all
rose
a
glorious
summer
sun
that
seemed
to
thrill
the
whole
landscape
with
life
and
warmth
and
glory
but
the
boys
had
no
eyes
for
all
this
beauty
they
were
far
more
concerned
about
the
tide
and
felt
inclined
to
resent
very
warmly
the
fact
that
it
should
be
out
just
when
they
wanted
to
have
a
swim
what
a
fraud
exclaimed
frank
my
word
i
believe
the
old
tide
is
twice
as
much
out
as
it
is
in
now
it
buntie
it
is
born
assented
tom
nothing
for
it
i
suppose
but
to
wait
and
so
saying
he
threw
himself
down
in
the
long
grass
his
friend
immediately
following
his
example
twenty
yards
away
emory
haynes
was
already
seated
with
his
face
turned
riverward
apparently
lost
in
deep
thought
wonder
what
thinking
about
remarked
tom
puzzling
out
some
of
those
confounded
problems
he
does
so
easily
perhaps
he
added
feelingly
for
he
had
had
some
humiliating
experiences
of
his
own
inability
to
get
over
the
safely
or
to
explain
why
was
equal
to
under
certain
perplexing
circumstances
more
probably
planning
what
do
with
that
five
pounds
said
frank
half
petulantly
i
guess
more
likely
to
go
into
books
than
into
a
boat
if
he
gets
hold
of
it
but
he
going
to
get
hold
of
it
objected
tom
and
then
without
giving
frank
a
chance
to
reply
he
burst
out
oh
i
say
frank
suppose
instead
of
waiting
here
we
go
down
to
meet
the
bore
and
have
a
race
back
with
it
illustration
they
saw
their
companion
embedded
nearly
to
the
waist
in
a
quicksand
frank
hesitated
a
moment
before
answering
for
what
tom
proposed
was
a
very
rash
thing
to
do
what
is
known
as
the
bore
is
the
big
wave
produced
by
the
onrush
of
water
in
a
place
where
the
tides
rise
forty
fifty
or
even
sixty
feet
according
to
the
time
of
year
the
bay
of
fundy
of
which
minas
basin
is
a
branch
is
famous
for
these
wonderful
tides
and
the
movements
of
the
water
make
a
sight
well
worth
watching
the
two
boys
had
often
looked
on
with
lively
interest
as
the
returning
flood
rushed
eagerly
up
the
channel
and
over
the
flats
until
in
an
incredibly
short
time
what
had
been
a
waste
of
red
mud
was
transformed
into
a
broad
expanse
of
turbid
water
rather
a
risky
business
tom
but
i
mind
trying
it
in
the
humour
for
almost
anything
so
come
along
and
without
more
ado
the
boys
doffed
their
boots
and
stockings
rolled
up
their
trousers
and
set
out
for
the
edge
emory
haynes
watched
them
in
silence
until
they
had
gone
about
fifty
yards
then
as
if
divining
their
foolish
design
he
called
after
them
are
you
going
to
going
to
meet
the
bore
you
want
to
come
frank
shouted
back
come
along
yankee
if
not
afraid
he
added
in
a
half
scornful
tone
not
the
words
but
the
tone
in
which
they
were
uttered
brought
an
angry
flush
out
on
sallow
cheeks
and
without
stopping
to
think
of
the
folly
of
the
thing
he
too
flung
off
his
boots
and
started
after
the
others
blessed
if
yankee
coming
after
all
said
tom
under
his
breath
to
frank
the
got
plenty
of
grit
in
him
side
by
side
but
in
somehow
or
other
they
felt
ill
at
three
boys
picked
their
way
carefully
over
the
slippery
mud
and
soft
sand
keeping
a
sharp
for
the
or
quicksands
in
which
they
might
easily
sink
to
their
waists
or
even
deeper
at
one
plunge
hardly
had
they
reached
the
edge
of
the
channel
when
frank
who
had
been
gazing
down
intently
toward
the
basin
called
out
there
it
comes
fellows
it
look
grand
a
good
way
off
still
but
drawing
nearer
with
astonishing
speed
a
wall
of
dark
water
came
rushing
up
the
channel
and
over
the
thirsty
flats
it
was
several
feet
in
height
and
behind
it
followed
the
whole
vast
volume
of
the
tide
the
three
lads
had
never
been
so
close
to
the
bore
before
and
they
stood
still
and
silent
watching
the
grand
sight
until
a
shout
from
emory
broke
the
spell
now
then
boys
run
for
it
as
fast
as
their
feet
could
carry
them
they
sped
over
the
treacherous
greasy
flats
leaping
the
gaping
gullies
turning
aside
from
the
suspicious
spots
and
steering
straight
for
the
place
where
they
had
left
their
shoes
frank
and
tom
were
both
famous
runners
and
soon
outstripped
emory
in
fact
they
were
more
than
to
the
bank
when
a
sharp
cry
of
alarm
made
them
stop
and
turn
to
see
what
was
the
matter
one
glance
was
enough
to
tell
them
twenty
yards
behind
they
saw
their
companion
embedded
nearly
to
the
waist
in
a
quicksand
from
which
he
was
madly
struggling
to
extricate
himself
while
his
efforts
seemed
only
to
sink
him
the
deeper
his
situation
was
one
of
extreme
peril
the
bore
had
somewhat
spent
its
force
but
still
advanced
steadily
unless
emory
was
rescued
without
delay
he
would
be
buried
beneath
its
pitiless
flood
for
one
brief
instant
frank
hesitated
and
tom
as
usual
waited
for
him
to
lead
thoughts
of
the
personal
risk
the
small
chance
of
succeeding
and
ever
after
the
mere
recollection
of
it
made
his
cheek
burn
with
the
advantage
it
would
be
to
have
his
rival
out
of
the
way
throbbed
through
his
brain
but
it
was
only
for
an
instant
and
then
with
a
shout
of
keep
cool
yankee
coming
he
grasped
arm
and
together
they
sprang
to
the
rescue
running
with
all
their
might
they
reached
their
imperilled
schoolmate
just
a
second
before
the
bore
did
and
standing
on
either
side
the
treacherous
spot
were
able
to
each
seize
a
hand
and
with
one
tremendous
effort
draw
him
out
of
its
deadly
embrace
ere
the
great
wave
came
sweeping
down
upon
them
tumbling
them
over
like
into
the
midst
of
its
muddy
surges
fortunately
however
all
three
were
good
swimmers
and
they
had
only
to
allow
the
water
to
work
its
will
with
them
for
after
a
little
tossing
about
it
landed
them
safely
on
a
whence
they
could
easily
wade
ashore
emory
did
not
say
much
to
his
rescuers
it
was
not
his
way
but
no
one
could
mistake
the
depth
of
feeling
expressed
in
the
few
words
frank
saved
my
life
and
never
forget
it
two
weeks
later
the
examinations
came
off
and
amid
the
applause
of
the
school
frank
hamilton
was
declared
winner
of
the
starr
prize
emory
haynes
being
only
just
a
few
points
behind
him
thomson
was
very
well
pleased
at
the
result
but
there
was
one
thing
that
puzzled
him
a
good
who
was
by
far
the
best
mathematical
scholar
in
the
school
had
somehow
or
other
done
by
no
means
so
well
in
that
branch
as
usual
in
fact
he
had
actually
left
several
not
questions
altogether
unanswered
and
this
more
than
anything
else
had
lost
him
the
prize
thomson
mentioned
the
matter
to
frank
hamilton
at
the
same
time
expressing
his
surprise
not
surprised
said
frank
as
something
that
looked
very
like
tears
welled
up
in
his
eyes
when
i
saved
life
he
said
never
forget
it
how
he
kept
his
word
thomson
needed
no
further
explanation
game
of
rink
hockey
the
part
performed
by
canada
in
making
contributions
to
the
list
of
the
amusements
has
been
by
no
means
slight
lacrosse
and
canoeing
for
the
warm
bright
days
of
summer
and
tobogganing
for
the
crisp
cold
nights
of
winter
these
make
up
a
quartette
of
healthy
hearty
sports
the
superiors
of
which
in
their
appropriate
season
any
other
country
might
safely
be
challenged
to
show
but
apparently
this
ambitious
colony
is
not
content
with
the
laurels
already
won
and
in
the
bringing
of
the
game
of
rink
hockey
to
perfection
would
add
another
to
her
garland
for
this
fine
game
as
played
in
the
canadian
cities
is
without
question
a
distinctly
home
product
not
that
hockey
is
native
to
the
soil
in
the
same
sense
as
lacrosse
in
a
simpler
form
and
under
different
names
it
has
long
existed
in
england
but
the
difference
between
the
game
as
played
there
on
the
green
and
played
in
canada
on
the
ice
is
as
great
as
that
between
an
game
of
rounders
and
a
professional
game
of
the
most
ancient
account
of
hockey
is
to
be
found
in
that
dear
delightful
old
book
sports
and
pastimes
of
the
people
of
england
where
it
figures
under
the
name
of
bandy
ball
is
now
called
the
hockey
stick
being
then
known
as
the
bandy
and
there
is
attached
to
the
description
a
comical
little
woodcut
representing
two
boys
in
short
frocks
each
wielding
bandies
almost
as
big
as
themselves
playing
with
a
ball
half
the
size
of
their
heads
as
first
played
in
canada
hockey
went
by
various
names
some
of
which
were
apparently
merely
shinny
rickets
and
so
forth
it
was
played
only
upon
the
ice
in
and
there
was
not
much
pretence
to
rules
each
player
taking
part
as
best
he
knew
how
no
effort
toward
systematizing
the
game
appears
to
have
been
made
until
the
year
when
the
members
of
the
montreal
football
club
in
search
of
some
lively
athletic
amusement
for
the
long
winter
months
recognized
in
hockey
the
very
thing
they
wanted
at
first
the
rules
adopted
for
the
regulation
of
the
game
were
modelled
upon
those
of
the
english
hockey
association
but
as
the
game
developed
many
changes
were
found
necessary
in
adapting
it
to
the
requirements
of
a
rink
and
the
rules
now
used
by
the
amateur
hockey
association
of
canada
are
in
the
main
original
with
it
starting
from
montreal
the
game
has
made
its
way
to
halifax
and
john
on
the
east
and
to
ottawa
and
toronto
on
the
west
and
from
the
enthusiasm
with
which
it
has
been
taken
up
at
these
cities
it
actually
threatens
to
displace
tobogganing
and
in
the
affections
of
the
young
men
let
me
now
try
to
give
my
readers
some
idea
of
the
game
and
the
way
in
which
it
is
played
please
picture
to
yourselves
a
with
an
ice
surface
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
length
by
feet
in
width
at
either
end
close
to
the
platform
are
the
goals
consisting
of
two
slender
poles
placed
six
feet
apart
and
standing
four
feet
high
with
small
red
flags
at
their
peaks
such
is
the
field
of
battle
and
upon
it
the
players
take
their
places
they
are
dressed
much
as
they
would
be
for
football
except
that
their
feet
are
shod
with
skates
of
a
peculiar
make
the
heel
projecting
more
than
in
an
ordinary
skate
in
order
to
guard
against
getting
a
nasty
fall
when
heeling
up
suddenly
each
player
is
armed
with
a
hockey
stick
as
to
the
size
of
which
the
only
rule
is
that
it
shall
not
be
more
than
three
inches
wide
at
any
part
a
good
stick
should
be
made
of
a
single
piece
of
ash
bent
not
sawed
into
the
proper
curve
of
the
length
and
weight
the
player
finds
to
suit
him
best
the
bone
of
contention
between
the
contending
sides
is
called
the
puck
and
is
a
circular
piece
of
vulcanized
rubber
one
inch
thick
all
through
and
three
inches
in
diameter
it
is
slightly
elastic
and
will
rebound
from
the
board
sides
of
the
rink
if
sent
violently
against
them
a
fact
which
enables
an
expert
player
to
evade
an
opponent
charging
down
to
wrest
it
from
him
as
by
striking
the
puck
against
the
boards
and
picking
it
up
again
on
the
rebound
he
can
keep
on
his
way
unchecked
the
teams
are
arranged
in
the
following
manner
takes
his
place
between
the
posts
and
a
little
forward
of
them
point
stands
about
four
yards
out
and
a
little
to
one
side
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
the
view
down
the
centre
position
is
from
ten
to
fifteen
yards
out
from
goal
and
on
the
opposite
side
to
point
post
is
indicated
by
his
name
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
right
and
left
forwards
and
the
who
supports
centre
illustration
the
game
goes
on
in
lively
earnest
for
the
control
of
the
game
there
are
a
referee
who
follows
it
about
as
does
the
referee
at
football
and
two
umpires
one
at
either
goal
the
sole
business
of
the
latter
being
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
puck
has
passed
between
the
posts
and
not
above
the
flags
play
begins
with
a
is
the
puck
is
placed
between
the
two
centres
in
the
centre
of
the
rink
and
they
after
solemnly
striking
their
sticks
together
three
times
scramble
for
its
possession
trying
either
to
drive
it
ahead
into
their
territory
or
behind
to
the
who
immediately
passes
it
to
one
of
the
forwards
then
the
game
goes
on
in
lively
earnest
and
when
the
teams
are
expert
and
well
matched
there
is
nothing
on
ice
to
compare
with
it
for
brilliancy
and
excitement
the
exceeding
swiftness
of
the
movements
the
sudden
variations
in
the
position
of
the
puck
as
under
the
impulse
of
sinewy
arms
it
darts
from
end
to
end
from
side
to
side
of
the
rink
the
incessant
grind
and
clatter
and
ring
of
the
skates
the
crack
of
the
hockeys
and
the
shouts
of
the
eager
combine
to
work
up
the
deepest
interest
among
the
spectators
and
the
announcement
of
a
match
between
two
good
teams
always
insures
a
large
and
enthusiastic
attendance
the
rules
by
which
the
game
is
governed
are
easily
understood
so
long
as
the
puck
is
on
the
ice
it
is
in
play
even
though
it
be
behind
the
goal
line
of
course
a
goal
can
be
won
only
from
the
front
but
an
opponent
who
is
not
may
follow
the
puck
behind
the
goal
line
and
fight
for
the
privilege
of
bringing
it
out
again
the
rules
as
to
and
are
precisely
the
same
as
in
rugby
football
that
is
to
say
a
player
must
always
be
between
his
own
goal
and
the
puck
when
he
plays
on
it
a
violation
of
this
rule
calls
for
a
bully
at
the
spot
where
the
wrong
stroke
was
made
the
referee
is
the
sole
judge
in
all
matters
of
this
kind
and
from
his
decision
there
is
no
appeal
the
puck
may
be
stopped
but
not
carried
or
knocked
on
by
any
part
of
the
body
in
striking
it
the
stick
must
not
be
raised
above
the
shoulder
the
object
of
this
rule
is
to
check
violence
and
the
effect
of
it
is
to
make
the
stroke
move
of
a
push
than
a
blow
insuring
greater
accuracy
in
shooting
for
goal
or
a
and
adding
greatly
to
the
grace
of
the
game
a
practised
player
will
with
wonderfully
little
manifest
effort
send
the
puck
from
end
to
end
of
the
rink
if
the
ice
is
at
all
in
good
condition
another
mode
of
propelling
the
puck
which
is
at
present
permissible
but
is
in
danger
of
being
ruled
out
is
lifting
i
can
not
very
well
explain
in
words
how
it
is
done
but
by
a
deft
turn
of
the
wrist
gained
only
by
diligent
practice
the
rubber
is
made
to
spring
into
the
air
and
fly
in
the
desired
direction
it
is
a
very
effective
but
dangerous
way
of
gaining
ground
the
danger
consisting
in
the
liability
of
players
to
be
struck
by
the
weighty
missile
and
ugly
blows
have
often
been
received
in
this
way
a
lift
at
the
goals
is
very
hard
to
stop
if
sent
in
low
and
swift
as
i
know
by
personal
experience
for
once
when
tending
goal
the
point
of
my
opponents
charged
down
the
length
of
the
rink
and
without
slackening
speed
lifted
the
puck
and
sent
it
past
me
like
a
bullet
while
i
was
making
ready
to
receive
it
on
the
ice
not
imagining
that
he
could
lift
successfully
while
at
full
speed
no
charging
from
behind
tripping
collaring
kicking
or
shinning
is
allowed
and
if
any
player
offends
after
two
warnings
it
is
the
duty
of
the
referee
to
order
him
off
the
ice
for
the
remainder
of
the
match
if
the
puck
goes
off
the
ice
behind
the
goals
it
must
be
taken
five
yards
out
at
right
angles
from
the
goal
line
and
there
faced
as
at
the
beginning
of
the
game
when
it
goes
off
the
ice
at
the
sides
it
must
be
faced
five
yards
at
right
angles
from
the
side
boundary
the
must
not
during
play
lie
kneel
or
sit
upon
the
ice
but
must
maintain
a
standing
position
he
may
stop
the
puck
with
his
hands
or
feet
but
may
not
throw
or
kick
it
away
from
the
goal
he
must
play
it
properly
with
his
stick
two
with
an
intermission
of
ten
minutes
to
regain
breath
and
wipe
off
the
perspiration
is
the
time
allowed
for
a
match
the
team
winning
the
most
goals
being
the
victors
there
are
no
other
points
than
goals
to
be
scored
such
are
the
principal
rules
and
now
for
a
few
words
in
conclusion
of
a
general
character
only
those
who
are
in
good
condition
and
at
home
on
their
skates
should
undertake
to
play
hockey
it
is
a
violent
game
and
tests
both
wind
and
muscle
to
the
utmost
the
player
must
make
up
his
mind
to
many
falls
and
no
lack
of
hard
knocks
on
shins
and
knuckles
for
such
things
will
happen
however
faithfully
the
contestants
try
to
keep
to
the
rules
at
the
same
time
these
very
characteristics
make
hockey
one
of
the
manliest
of
sports
strength
speed
endurance
shrewdness
are
the
necessary
qualities
of
one
who
would
excel
in
it
combination
play
is
just
as
effective
in
it
as
in
football
and
there
is
no
practical
limit
to
the
skill
that
may
be
attained
a
very
important
feature
of
hockey
is
that
it
may
be
played
at
night
since
the
introduction
of
the
electric
light
our
rinks
are
made
as
bright
as
day
and
then
the
many
young
men
who
are
too
busy
all
day
to
take
part
in
any
sport
have
the
opportunity
of
an
splendid
exercise
after
their
work
is
over
take
it
all
in
all
there
is
perhaps
no
winter
sport
exclusively
for
men
that
is
destined
to
become
more
popular
or
have
more
enduring
favour
in
canada
new
associations
are
rapidly
springing
up
and
local
leagues
that
arrange
a
schedule
of
matches
for
the
season
the
boys
are
taking
hold
of
the
game
with
great
zest
closely
imitating
the
tricks
and
artifices
of
their
big
brothers
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
hockey
has
definitely
taken
its
place
among
the
national
sports
of
canada
the
edge
of
the
rapids
hurrah
lon
got
the
sort
of
day
been
looking
for
at
last
cried
alec
pearson
as
he
met
his
chum
one
lovely
still
summer
morning
no
trouble
about
getting
over
to
deschenes
right
you
are
alec
this
is
just
the
correct
thing
start
straight
after
as
soon
as
you
like
provided
got
the
grub
ready
think
of
going
without
that
you
know
no
sir
a
basket
of
half
the
fun
and
promised
me
a
big
one
ditto
mine
responded
alec
so
no
fear
of
our
starving
for
a
while
even
if
we
get
cast
away
on
one
of
the
islands
cast
away
on
one
of
the
islands
echoed
lon
a
great
idea
it
make
a
great
sensation
perhaps
it
would
replied
alec
who
was
of
a
more
cautious
and
unimaginative
cast
of
character
but
not
hankering
to
try
it
all
the
same
to
get
over
to
deschenes
will
be
enough
fun
for
me
the
speakers
were
two
boys
of
about
sixteen
years
of
age
sitting
upon
the
front
steps
of
a
summer
cottage
and
looking
out
across
the
splendid
stretch
of
water
that
flashed
like
a
flawless
mirror
beneath
the
fiery
morning
sunshine
they
had
come
out
to
britannia
for
the
summer
and
were
enjoying
its
fine
facilities
for
boating
bathing
and
canoeing
as
only
city
boys
pent
up
in
close
quarters
for
of
the
year
can
enjoy
such
exhilarating
sports
the
great
lake
deschenes
filled
them
with
profound
admiration
they
exulted
in
its
magnificent
breadth
its
mighty
length
its
cool
limpid
depths
and
most
of
all
the
glorious
rapids
which
marked
the
place
where
it
gathered
itself
together
to
become
the
river
ottawa
again
and
resume
its
steady
course
seaward
nearly
all
their
time
they
spent
upon
the
water
or
in
it
and
in
the
course
of
a
month
had
become
tolerably
expert
canoeists
so
that
they
did
not
hesitate
to
take
long
trips
up
the
lake
or
across
to
the
farther
side
the
visit
to
deschenes
village
whose
cottages
were
scattered
along
the
lake
shore
almost
opposite
to
britannia
had
been
put
off
until
they
felt
themselves
to
be
thoroughly
masters
of
their
cranky
craft
for
in
order
to
get
there
it
was
necessary
to
cross
the
head
of
the
rapids
and
to
do
this
successfully
would
require
both
strength
and
skill
for
a
week
past
alec
and
lon
had
felt
themselves
to
be
equal
to
the
task
but
had
been
delayed
by
unfavourable
weather
great
then
was
their
delight
when
this
particular
saturday
morning
dawned
clear
and
calm
promising
to
be
the
very
kind
of
a
day
they
desired
they
started
at
nine
taking
with
them
for
company
besides
their
baskets
wad
handsome
hunting
spaniel
who
had
learned
to
behave
perfectly
on
board
the
canoe
their
craft
was
of
the
most
approved
make
of
which
they
were
completely
equipped
with
paddles
cushions
sails
and
there
being
not
a
breath
of
wind
they
had
no
use
for
the
sail
so
the
mast
was
not
put
up
nor
the
rudder
shipped
in
his
enthusiastic
eagerness
to
realize
their
plan
lon
set
to
paddling
with
all
his
might
but
alec
who
had
the
stern
laughingly
checked
his
ardour
saying
take
it
easy
lon
take
it
easy
my
boy
lots
of
work
ahead
of
you
better
not
waste
your
muscle
now
alec
had
taken
care
to
make
inquiries
of
some
of
the
britannia
folk
as
to
the
course
he
should
steer
and
they
had
all
impressed
upon
him
to
go
a
good
way
straight
up
the
lake
and
away
from
the
rapids
before
turning
toward
deschenes
as
the
current
was
tremendously
strong
and
made
itself
felt
far
higher
up
than
one
would
imagine
looking
at
it
from
the
britannia
side
accordingly
he
pointed
the
canoe
almost
due
north
as
though
he
had
aylmer
in
mind
rather
than
deschenes
and
kept
her
on
that
course
until
lon
began
to
grow
impatient
the
use
of
going
up
so
far
he
protested
you
feel
the
current
here
because
old
lark
told
me
to
make
that
point
before
striking
across
and
he
knows
all
about
it
replied
alec
ugh
an
old
fuss
he
goes
away
up
there
only
because
too
lazy
to
pull
straight
across
where
the
strong
grumbled
lon
who
had
a
passion
for
short
cuts
and
who
kept
urging
his
companion
to
head
the
canoe
more
directly
toward
their
destination
until
at
last
alec
for
very
sake
and
against
his
better
judgment
altered
their
course
in
compliance
with
his
wishes
for
a
hundred
yards
or
so
the
paddling
was
no
harder
than
before
and
they
made
no
leeway
so
that
lon
could
exclaim
triumphantly
there
now
i
tell
you
only
a
waste
of
time
going
so
far
up
but
when
another
hundred
advance
had
brought
the
canoe
fairly
into
the
middle
of
the
mighty
stream
moving
with
majestic
flow
toward
the
angry
rapids
the
paddlers
soon
awoke
to
the
fact
that
while
they
were
still
making
good
headway
they
were
making
considerable
leeway
also
and
that
the
task
of
getting
across
was
going
to
be
made
much
harder
thereby
although
both
noticed
this
neither
made
any
remark
about
it
at
first
alec
because
he
did
not
wish
to
alarm
lon
and
lon
because
he
shrank
from
admitting
that
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
follow
shrewd
old
advice
so
they
paddled
away
in
silence
putting
plenty
of
muscle
into
their
strokes
and
anxiously
measuring
their
progress
by
landmarks
on
the
farther
shore
presently
their
exertions
began
to
toll
upon
their
young
frames
the
perspiration
beaded
their
faces
their
breath
came
short
their
backs
began
aching
and
their
arms
grew
weary
heart
was
already
sinking
within
him
and
alec
deeply
regretted
having
yielded
to
his
solicitations
to
disregard
old
lark
but
there
was
no
time
for
reconsideration
or
exchanging
of
regrets
they
were
beyond
a
doubt
in
the
grasp
of
the
current
and
must
strain
every
nerve
to
extricate
themselves
then
to
add
to
their
anxiety
the
weather
showed
signs
of
betraying
the
fair
promise
of
the
morning
clouds
began
to
obscure
the
deep
blue
of
the
sky
and
a
breeze
to
ruffle
the
calm
surface
of
the
lake
unable
to
control
his
feelings
any
longer
lon
broke
out
with
more
than
a
hint
of
a
sob
in
his
voice
o
alec
i
wish
we
started
getting
awfully
tired
and
we
seem
to
be
making
any
headway
at
all
oh
yes
we
are
lon
responded
alec
doing
his
best
to
be
cheerful
paddle
away
get
across
all
right
thus
encouraged
lon
put
a
little
more
life
into
his
strokes
for
the
next
few
minutes
and
the
canoe
did
seem
to
be
gaining
ground
but
the
gain
was
only
temporary
the
further
they
advanced
the
more
they
felt
the
force
of
the
current
yet
it
was
too
late
to
turn
back
their
only
course
was
to
keep
on
until
they
had
shaken
themselves
free
from
the
power
that
was
dragging
them
downward
to
destruction
whether
they
would
have
been
equal
to
this
feat
can
only
be
guessed
for
in
trying
to
change
his
position
to
relieve
his
cramped
legs
lon
lost
his
balance
for
a
moment
and
on
attempting
to
recover
himself
did
what
was
even
slip
his
paddle
which
was
instantly
whirled
out
of
his
reach
o
alec
what
shall
we
do
now
he
cried
in
dismay
face
was
white
and
set
are
powerless
he
said
quietly
it
was
of
course
futile
for
him
to
try
to
contend
alone
with
the
pitiless
current
the
little
canoe
as
if
glad
at
having
no
longer
to
fight
its
way
foot
by
foot
glided
gaily
down
towards
the
rapids
and
all
that
alec
could
do
was
to
keep
it
straight
in
its
course
and
not
allow
it
to
swing
around
broadside
poor
lon
utterly
overcome
with
terror
crouched
down
in
the
bow
sobbing
so
that
he
shook
the
frail
canoe
but
alec
was
not
one
to
yield
to
despair
so
long
as
anything
could
be
done
his
brain
was
busy
seeking
some
scheme
for
escape
from
their
exceeding
peril
and
as
he
glanced
anxiously
ahead
a
thought
flashed
into
his
mind
that
caused
his
eye
to
brighten
and
his
pale
face
to
light
up
with
hope
and
determination
right
on
the
edge
of
the
rapids
just
before
the
smooth
swift
stream
broke
up
into
tumultuous
billows
stood
a
little
mere
patch
of
rocks
crowned
with
straggling
trees
if
he
could
only
beach
the
canoe
on
this
island
they
might
yet
be
saved
it
was
all
that
remained
between
them
and
certain
death
the
island
was
not
more
than
two
hundred
yards
distant
and
to
reach
it
he
must
make
the
canoe
cut
obliquely
through
the
current
summoning
all
his
energies
for
a
supreme
effort
he
bent
to
his
task
in
the
meantime
saying
to
lon
be
ready
to
jump
the
moment
the
canoe
strikes
for
a
boy
of
his
age
alec
put
a
wonderful
degree
of
strength
into
his
strokes
and
he
had
the
joy
of
seeing
his
frail
craft
obey
in
spite
of
the
opposing
waters
until
it
was
pointing
fair
for
the
island
then
with
a
glad
hurrah
he
ceased
fighting
the
current
and
joined
forces
with
it
so
successfully
as
to
drive
the
canoe
straight
towards
the
rocks
he
did
not
miss
his
aim
with
a
leap
as
though
it
were
alive
the
canoe
rushed
at
the
island
and
ran
half
its
length
out
of
the
water
a
sound
of
splintering
wood
telling
that
its
bottom
had
suffered
in
so
doing
with
feelings
of
indescribable
relief
the
boys
sprang
out
upon
the
solid
ground
and
instantly
embracing
one
another
danced
about
in
sheer
exuberance
of
joy
the
rapids
were
cheated
of
their
prey
and
the
worst
of
the
peril
was
passed
having
thus
given
vent
to
their
feelings
they
proceeded
to
examine
the
canoe
and
were
glad
to
find
that
its
bottom
was
not
very
badly
injured
and
could
be
easily
repaired
their
next
thought
was
how
could
they
get
off
the
island
they
were
safe
enough
there
for
the
present
of
course
and
they
had
sufficient
provisions
if
carefully
husbanded
to
keep
them
from
starving
for
three
or
four
days
but
they
had
no
idea
of
playing
the
part
of
robinson
crusoe
and
his
man
friday
even
for
that
short
space
of
time
if
it
could
possibly
be
helped
so
they
got
on
the
edge
of
the
island
nearest
britannia
and
alec
held
up
his
paddle
with
his
coat
on
it
as
a
signal
of
distress
while
both
shouted
at
the
top
of
their
voices
their
shouts
were
drowned
in
the
ceaseless
roar
of
the
rapids
but
after
a
while
their
signal
of
distress
was
observed
and
soon
a
crowd
had
gathered
on
the
shore
opposite
them
and
there
was
great
excitement
everybody
was
eager
to
help
but
nobody
knew
just
what
to
do
all
sorts
of
schemes
were
suggested
for
the
rescue
of
the
boys
the
most
feasible
of
which
was
to
have
a
large
boat
go
out
above
the
rapids
and
anchor
there
and
then
send
down
a
smaller
one
secured
by
a
rope
with
which
it
could
be
hauled
back
again
for
no
boat
could
by
any
possibility
be
rowed
back
against
that
mighty
current
but
there
were
two
difficulties
in
the
way
of
this
plan
there
was
no
boat
at
the
village
big
enough
and
no
rope
long
enough
for
the
purpose
so
some
other
way
must
needs
be
devised
the
morning
wore
away
and
the
afternoon
shadows
lengthened
without
anything
being
done
and
it
looked
as
though
the
boys
would
have
to
stay
on
the
island
all
night
when
the
cry
was
raised
that
there
was
a
raft
coming
down
and
sure
enough
the
great
towing
steamer
followed
by
a
huge
raft
of
square
timber
hove
into
sight
far
up
the
lake
the
problem
of
the
deliverance
need
no
longer
he
worried
over
the
raftsmen
would
solve
it
in
short
measure
the
big
raft
reached
britannia
just
long
enough
before
dark
to
allow
of
the
rescue
being
accomplished
the
moment
the
foreman
heard
of
the
situation
he
detailed
six
of
his
best
men
three
being
indians
and
three
french
canadians
to
bring
them
off
landing
their
largest
bonne
a
kind
of
boat
peculiar
to
lumbering
being
flat
on
the
bottom
and
very
high
at
both
bow
and
stern
they
rowed
off
briskly
towards
the
rapids
laughing
and
chaffing
one
another
and
evidently
deeming
it
quite
a
bit
of
fun
while
the
crowd
gathered
on
the
shore
watched
their
every
movement
with
breathless
attention
managing
their
but
most
seaworthy
craft
with
perfect
skill
they
made
an
easy
landing
on
the
island
took
the
boys
on
board
and
then
waving
their
hats
to
the
admiring
onlookers
continued
gaily
on
into
the
very
midst
of
the
boiling
rapids
the
big
bonne
bobbing
about
like
a
cork
seemingly
at
the
entire
mercy
of
the
waters
yet
all
the
time
being
cleverly
steered
by
her
crew
and
after
an
exciting
passage
during
which
the
boys
hardly
breathed
shooting
out
into
the
smooth
stretch
below
the
rapids
without
having
taken
so
much
as
a
single
drop
of
water
on
board
a
hearty
cheer
broke
from
the
delighted
spectators
at
this
happy
conclusion
to
the
affair
and
a
few
moments
later
the
boys
were
in
their
midst
receiving
the
embraces
of
their
overjoyed
parents
and
the
vigorous
congratulations
of
the
others
the
rescuing
raftsmen
were
well
rewarded
for
their
timely
service
and
master
lon
learned
a
lesson
in
caution
that
he
is
not
likely
soon
to
forget
illustration
triumph
tobogganing
triumph
the
boys
of
bridgetown
were
all
agreed
that
there
had
not
been
such
a
winter
for
tobogganing
since
they
could
remember
and
if
they
ever
thought
of
the
at
all
it
was
with
feelings
of
the
deepest
gratitude
in
the
first
place
it
began
with
a
frost
that
made
the
ground
as
hard
as
iron
and
the
waters
were
in
bible
language
hid
as
with
a
stone
then
upon
this
came
one
fall
of
snow
after
the
other
until
there
was
nothing
left
to
wish
for
in
that
direction
and
the
hoys
were
thoroughly
content
not
only
was
the
thus
considerate
but
nature
had
already
been
kind
enough
to
provide
them
with
the
finest
site
for
a
toboggan
slide
imaginable
the
placid
stream
which
bore
the
name
of
bass
river
spread
out
into
a
broad
reach
just
before
it
came
to
their
town
and
on
one
side
the
bank
rose
up
into
a
steep
bluff
whose
face
slanting
right
down
to
the
edge
without
a
break
or
gully
seemed
intended
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
afford
the
boys
a
splendid
when
well
sheeted
with
snow
and
the
boys
knew
right
well
how
to
appreciate
their
privileges
i
can
assure
you
to
go
out
to
bass
river
bluff
on
a
saturday
afternoon
was
to
witness
a
scene
well
worth
seeing
the
hill
would
fairly
swarm
with
boys
and
girls
enjoying
themselves
to
the
top
of
their
bent
from
patsey
kehoe
the
ragged
urchin
with
his
curious
apology
for
a
sled
constructed
out
of
old
barrel
staves
on
which
he
dared
to
take
only
short
slides
from
a
little
way
up
the
hill
and
which
he
sorely
regretted
was
not
big
enough
to
carry
him
and
katey
at
the
same
time
to
ralph
masterton
the
eldest
son
of
the
rich
and
haughty
judge
with
his
big
toboggan
so
finely
varnished
and
comfortably
cushioned
that
could
take
four
persons
down
every
trip
the
young
people
of
the
town
would
turn
out
and
make
the
valley
ring
with
their
laughter
and
shouting
one
of
the
most
regular
attendants
at
bass
river
bluff
was
theo
ross
who
with
his
widowed
mother
lived
in
a
cozy
cottage
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
from
the
town
and
consequently
was
looked
upon
as
one
of
the
country
boys
although
he
came
in
every
day
to
the
high
school
there
was
a
good
deal
of
rivalry
between
the
boys
of
bridgetown
and
those
who
lived
in
the
scattered
settlement
across
the
river
which
was
known
as
rivalry
that
led
to
all
sorts
of
matches
and
now
and
then
to
fights
no
one
took
more
hearty
interest
in
this
rivalry
than
theo
he
was
a
strong
stout
hardy
lad
of
sixteen
up
to
anything
as
the
saying
is
and
was
generally
looked
upon
by
the
riverside
boys
as
their
leader
one
saturday
evening
he
came
home
in
high
spirits
he
shouted
as
he
burst
into
the
house
why
theo
what
are
you
so
excited
about
inquired
his
mother
looking
up
with
a
glad
smile
of
welcome
for
the
boy
that
was
the
joy
and
pride
of
her
life
excited
perhaps
i
am
and
no
wonder
for
we
going
to
have
the
biggest
tobogganing
match
next
saturday
afternoon
that
you
ever
heard
of
replied
theo
at
the
same
time
giving
his
mother
a
hug
and
a
kiss
that
were
a
credit
to
both
for
it
showed
how
thoroughly
they
understood
one
another
ross
was
a
wise
not
less
than
a
loving
mother
and
one
of
the
proofs
of
her
wisdom
was
the
hearty
interest
she
took
in
her
sports
as
well
as
in
his
studies
he
had
lost
his
father
when
but
a
baby
and
she
had
determined
to
fill
the
vacant
place
to
the
best
of
her
ability
so
from
the
very
first
she
entered
heartily
into
his
amusements
and
made
herself
his
companion
as
far
as
she
could
theo
never
played
cricket
or
lacrosse
so
well
as
when
his
mother
was
looking
on
and
no
applause
was
sweeter
to
him
than
the
clapping
of
her
hands
he
therefore
felt
sure
of
an
attentive
listener
as
he
proceeded
to
unfold
the
cause
of
his
excitement
well
you
know
mother
the
bridgetown
boys
have
been
boasting
all
winter
about
their
toboggans
and
saying
that
they
can
run
away
from
anything
in
riverside
and
our
fellows
have
been
talking
back
at
them
until
both
sides
have
begun
to
feel
pretty
hot
over
it
had
a
lot
of
races
but
they
settle
anything
because
sometimes
the
bridgetown
boys
would
win
and
sometimes
the
riverside
so
this
afternoon
i
proposed
to
ralph
masterton
that
next
saturday
afternoon
he
should
bring
a
team
of
four
tobogganers
from
the
town
and
i
would
bring
four
from
the
country
and
settle
the
question
without
any
more
talk
well
but
theo
dear
it
be
dangerous
for
so
many
as
eight
to
coast
down
together
you
might
run
into
each
other
asked
ross
rather
anxiously
o
you
dear
innocent
laughed
theo
not
the
way
do
at
all
only
two
will
go
down
at
a
time
you
see
there
will
be
first
of
all
four
heats
and
draw
lots
for
our
places
in
the
heats
then
the
four
winners
will
run
against
each
other
making
two
more
heats
and
then
there
will
be
a
final
heat
in
which
the
two
winners
will
run
together
and
that
will
decide
that
seems
a
very
good
arrangement
said
ross
approvingly
whose
idea
was
it
mostly
mine
mother
the
best
way
to
get
fair
play
all
round
answered

difficulty

the
fourth
chap

out
through
the
week
well
theo
you
must
do
your
best

win

watch
you

may
depend
upon
it
i
will
for
your
sake
as
much
as
for
the
honour
of
riverside
replied
theo
giving
his
mother
a
loving
kiss
before
he
went
off
to
his
room
for
a
wash
it
seemed
an
awfully
long
week
to
the
excited
boys
impatient
for
the
coming
contest
theo
had
many
applicants
for
a
position
on
his
team
and
having
after
careful
deliberation
decided
in
favour
of
fred
fellows
the
four
boys
had
many
an
earnest
consultation
as
to
the
best
way
of
securing
success
on
friday
evening
the
others
brought
their
toboggans
over
to
and
they
spent
an
hour
or
two
in
seeing
that
the
bottoms
were
perfectly
smooth
the
gut
lashings
all
taut
and
the
cushions
secured
beyond
the
possibility
of
slipping
they
were
not
a
little
disturbed
at
some
rumours
that
had
reached
them
of
ralph
masterton
having
sent
off
to
the
capital
and
got
a
new
toboggan
of
a
kind
just
lately
patented
which
was
made
differently
from
the
others
and
reported
to
be
much
faster
if
this
was
true
ralph
had
done
rather
a
mean
thing
for
although
not
expressly
stipulated
it
was
generally
understood
that
the
toboggans
to
be
used
in
the
contest
were
such
as
they
already
had
and
not
new
ones
imported
for
the
purpose
but
as
theo
sensibly
said
it
was
no
use
worrying
until
they
knew
for
certain
so
hoping
for
the
best
they
parted
for
the
night
saturday
proved
as
fine
as
could
be
wished
and
early
in
the
afternoon
a
crowd
began
to
gather
on
bass
river
bluff
besides
the
honour
of
the
championship
judge
masterton
had
offered
a
handsome
prize
to
the
winner
in
the
shape
of
a
silver
cup
and
there
was
no
end
to
the
excitement
the
judge
himself
and
all
his
family
were
present
so
too
were
mother
and
the
parents
of
the
other
contestants
so
too
was
patsey
kehoe
holding
katey
with
one
hand
and
dragging
his
forlorn
little
sled
with
the
other
everybody
in
bridgetown
and
riverside
that
could
come
had
come
and
the
flat
top
of
the
bluff
was
fairly
black
with
spectators
by
three
all
the
competitors
had
arrived
when
ralph
masterton
appeared
theo
gave
one
sharp
glance
at
his
toboggan
then
turned
to
his
companions
with
his
face
the
picture
of
indignation
true
boys
after
all
got
one
of
those
affairs
i
read
of
in
the
papers
they
say
they
can
go
like
smoke
he
done
the
square
thing
but
not
beaten
yet
for
all
that
and
theo
looked
proudly
down
at
his
toboggan
which
had
won
as
high
a
reputation
for
speed
as
the
owner
had
for
skill
it
took
to
draw
lots
for
the
heats
and
then
at
last
all
was
ready
and
judge
masterton
acting
as
starter
called
out
the
first
pair
besides
the
steerer
each
toboggan
was
to
carry
another
person
for
ballast
fred
fellows
was
the
first
of
team
to
try
his
fortune
amid
breathless
silence
and
suspense
he
put
his
toboggan
in
position
beside
his
are
you
ready
asked
the
judge
they
both
nodded
and
with
quick
steps
they
pushed
their
toboggans
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
flinging
themselves
on
sideways
with
one
leg
extended
for
a
rudder
shot
down
the
steep
slope
like
arrows
from
a
bow
for
some
time
they
kept
side
by
side
then
fred
was
seen
to
swerve
and
slew
and
the
bridgetown
boy
to
slip
ahead
the
advantage
was
not
much
but
he
kept
it
to
the
end
and
the
first
heat
went
against
riverside
the
bridgetown
boys
cheered
lustily
and
the
riversiders
looked
rather
glum
until
the
next
heat
was
run
and
resulted
in
a
win
for
the
latter
thus
making
things
even
the
riverside
entry
took
the
third
heat
also
and
their
hopes
ran
high
but
cooled
down
again
when
the
fourth
heat
went
to
bridgetown
the
result
of
the
first
round
accordingly
was
that
two
of
each
side
had
won
their
heats
theo
and
ralph
being
of
course
among
the
winners
the
excitement
grew
more
and
more
intense
as
after
a
little
the
second
round
was
called
curiously
enough
theo
and
ralph
did
not
come
together
in
this
round
either
having
each
another
opponent
whom
they
vanquished
easily
as
they
stood
on
the
hill
together
at
the
conclusion
of
the
round
ralph
turned
to
theo
with
a
smile
which
betokened
perfect
confidence
in
himself
and
pointing
to
his
new
toboggan
said
a
hummer
nothing
on
the
bluff
to
touch
her
do
you
think
it
was
just
the
square
thing
ralph
to
get
that
toboggan
when
it
was
understood
we
were
to
race
with
what
we
had
already
asked
theo
quietly
pooh
replied
ralph
tossing
his
head
defiantly
fair
in
love
and
war
as
he
turned
away
and
swung
his
toboggan
round
it
came
in
contact
with
patsey
sled
with
a
muttered
oath
ralph
sprang
toward
the
obstruction
and
kicking
it
high
into
the
air
the
clumsy
little
thing
fell
to
the
ground
shattered
into
useless
fragments
poor
patsey
gave
a
cry
as
he
saw
his
plaything
demolished
but
angry
face
silenced
him
again
and
with
tears
running
down
their
cheeks
he
and
katey
proceeded
to
gather
up
the
pieces
get
ready
for
the
final
heat
called
out
judge
masterton
ross
pressed
forward
to
side
and
whispered
in
his
ear
good
luck
to
you
my
boy
with
every
eye
upon
them
ralph
and
theo
drew
their
toboggans
into
position
the
difference
between
the
two
toboggans
was
very
marked
was
a
particularly
fine
one
of
the
ordinary
kind
but
was
made
of
narrow
strips
secured
by
screws
instead
of
thongs
and
had
a
sharp
racing
look
that
could
not
be
mistaken
just
as
the
contestants
were
ready
to
receive
their
ballast
glance
fell
upon
patsey
kehoe
pressing
forward
eagerly
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd
watching
him
with
his
whole
soul
in
his
eyes
he
knew
well
how
intensely
the
little
fellow
hoped
for
his
success
and
suddenly
an
idea
flashed
into
his
mind
which
caused
him
to
call
out
to
judge
masterton
a
time
please
sir
all
right
my
lad
replied
the
judge
then
to
the
surprise
of
everybody
theo
after
whispering
to
walter
powell
whom
he
had
first
intended
to
be
his
companion
on
the
toboggan
and
who
now
drew
aside
beckoned
to
patsey
kehoe
patsy
approached
bashfully
jump
on
in
front
patsey
said
theo
briskly
to
be
my
ballast
this
time
there
was
a
murmur
of
astonishment
from
the
crowd
as
the
ragged
little
chap
awkwardly
got
into
his
place
and
theo
did
not
miss
the
contemptuous
curl
of
his
lip
but
neither
did
he
fail
to
catch
the
pleased
approving
look
his
mother
sent
him
a
moment
more
and
everything
was
in
readiness
the
spectators
held
their
breath
as
the
judge
lifting
his
right
hand
asked
are
you
ready
and
then
bringing
it
down
with
a
crack
into
the
other
shouted
as
if
shot
from
a
bow
the
two
toboggans
leaped
over
the
bluff
and
went
rattling
down
the
smooth
slope
side
by
side
and
head
to
head
went
theo
and
ralph
with
iron
grip
and
toe
keeping
them
straight
in
their
course
and
patsey
and
the
other
ballast
clinging
fast
to
the
it
was
the
proudest
moment
of
life
and
one
that
he
would
never
forget
just
as
the
toboggans
still
perfectly
even
approached
the
bottom
of
the
declivity
where
the
track
ran
out
on
to
the
bosom
of
the
river
struck
a
slight
obstacle
which
caused
it
to
swerve
and
then
to
slew
with
a
vicious
dig
of
his
toe
he
tried
to
bring
it
round
straight
again
in
his
hot
haste
he
overdid
it
and
the
head
swung
round
until
the
toboggan
went
broadside
to
the
track
scratching
bumping
cracking
until
like
a
flash
it
came
bang
against
the
side
of
the
slide
pitching
its
passengers
out
upon
their
heads
and
splitting
one
of
the
thin
strips
clean
in
two
in
the
meanwhile
theo
and
patsey
amid
the
cheers
of
the
crowd
on
the
hill
were
speeding
smoothly
over
the
level
ice
winners
by
nearly
a
hundred
yards
great
was
the
delight
of
the
riverside
folk
at
their
victory
and
many
of
the
bridgetownians
joined
in
congratulations
too
for
ralph
masterton
was
far
from
popular
among
them
when
theo
reached
the
top
of
the
bluff
his
mother
hastened
to
him
her
face
beaming
with
pleasure
as
she
said
i
am
very
proud
of
your
victory
theo
but
i
am
prouder
still
of
the
heart
that
prompted
you
to
take
patsey
kehoe
the
end
