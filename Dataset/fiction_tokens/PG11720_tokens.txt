chapter
i
the
common
fever
a
warm
summer
evening
with
a
sultry
haze
brooding
over
the
level
landscape
and
a
sabbath
stillness
upon
all
things
in
the
village
of
lidford
midlandshire
in
the
remoter
corners
of
the
old
gothic
church
the
shadows
are
beginning
to
gather
as
the
sermon
draws
near
its
close
but
in
the
centre
aisle
and
about
the
pulpit
there
is
broad
daylight
still
from
the
wide
western
window
across
the
lower
half
of
which
there
are
tall
figures
of
the
evangelists
in
old
stained
glass
there
are
no
choristers
at
lidford
and
the
evening
service
is
conducted
in
rather
a
drowsy
way
but
there
is
a
solemn
air
of
repose
about
the
gray
old
church
that
should
be
conducive
to
tranquil
thoughts
and
pious
meditations
simple
and
earnest
have
been
the
words
of
the
sermon
simple
and
earnest
seem
the
countenances
of
the
congregation
looking
reverently
upwards
at
the
face
of
their
pastor
and
one
might
fancy
contemplating
that
grand
old
church
so
much
too
spacious
for
the
needs
of
the
little
flock
gathered
there
that
lidford
was
a
forgotten
corner
of
this
earth
in
which
a
man
tired
of
the
press
and
turmoil
of
the
world
might
find
an
almost
monastic
solitude
and
calm
so
thought
a
gentleman
in
the
squire
pew
a
man
of
about
thirty
who
was
finishing
his
first
sunday
at
lidford
by
devout
attendance
at
evening
service
he
had
been
thinking
a
good
deal
about
this
quiet
country
life
during
the
service
wondering
whether
it
was
not
the
best
life
a
man
could
live
after
all
and
thinking
it
all
the
sweeter
because
of
his
own
experience
which
had
lain
chiefly
in
cities
he
was
a
certain
gilbert
fenton
an
australian
merchant
and
was
on
a
visit
to
his
sister
who
had
married
the
principal
landowner
in
lidford
martin
lister
a
man
whose
father
had
been
called
the
squire
the
lady
sat
opposite
her
brother
in
the
wide
old
family
pew
a
matron
with
a
little
damsel
sitting
by
her
side
a
damsel
with
flowing
auburn
hair
tiny
hat
and
feather
and
bright
scarlet
stockings
looking
very
much
as
if
she
had
walked
out
of
a
picture
by
millais
the
congregation
stood
up
to
sing
a
hymn
when
the
sermon
was
ended
and
gilbert
fenton
turned
his
face
towards
the
opposite
line
of
pews
in
one
of
which
very
near
him
there
was
a
girl
at
whom
lister
had
caught
her
brother
looking
very
often
during
the
service
just
concluded
it
was
a
face
that
a
man
could
scarcely
look
upon
once
without
finding
his
glances
wandering
back
to
it
afterwards
not
quite
a
perfect
face
but
a
very
bright
and
winning
one
large
gray
eyes
with
a
wonderful
light
in
them
under
dark
lashes
and
darker
brows
a
complexion
that
had
a
dusky
pallor
a
delicate
that
one
seldom
sees
out
of
a
spanish
picture
a
sweet
rosy
mouth
and
a
piquant
little
nose
of
no
particular
order
made
up
the
catalogue
of
this
young
charms
but
in
a
face
worth
looking
at
there
is
always
a
something
that
can
not
be
put
into
words
and
the
brightest
and
best
attributes
of
this
face
were
quite
beyond
translation
it
was
a
face
one
might
almost
call
splendid
there
was
such
a
light
and
glory
about
it
at
some
moments
gilbert
fenton
thought
so
as
he
saw
it
in
the
full
radiance
of
the
western
sunlight
the
lips
parted
as
the
girl
sang
the
clear
gray
eyes
looking
upward
she
was
not
alone
a
portly
old
man
stood
by
her
side
and
accompanied
her
to
the
when
the
hymn
was
over
here
they
both
lingered
a
moment
to
shake
hands
with
lister
very
much
to
gilbert
fenton
satisfaction
they
walked
along
the
together
and
gilbert
gave
his
sister
arm
a
little
tug
which
meant
introduce
me
my
brother
fenton
captain
sedgewick
miss
nowell
the
captain
shook
hands
with
gilbert
delighted
to
know
you
fenton
delighted
to
know
any
one
belonging
to
lister
you
are
going
to
stop
down
here
for
some
time
i
hope
i
fear
not
for
very
long
captain
sedgewick
i
am
a
business
man
you
see
and
ca
afford
to
take
a
long
holiday
from
the
city
lister
laughed
my
brother
is
utterly
devoted
to
commercial
pursuits
she
said
i
think
he
believes
every
hour
wasted
that
he
spends
out
of
his
and
yet
i
was
thinking
in
church
this
evening
that
a
man
life
might
be
happier
in
such
a
place
as
this
drifting
away
in
a
kind
of
dreamy
idleness
than
the
greatest
successes
possible
to
commerce
could
ever
make
it
you
would
very
soon
be
tired
of
your
dreamy
idleness
answered
his
sister
and
sigh
for
your
office
and
your
club
the
country
suits
old
people
who
have
played
their
part
in
life
and
made
an
end
of
it
said
the
captain
it
suits
my
little
girl
here
very
well
too
he
added
with
a
fond
glance
at
his
companion
she
has
her
birds
and
her
flowers
and
her
books
and
music
and
i
do
think
she
ever
sighs
for
anything
gayer
than
lidford
never
uncle
george
said
the
girl
slipping
her
hand
through
his
arm
and
gilbert
fenton
saw
that
those
two
were
very
fond
of
each
other
they
came
to
the
end
of
a
shady
winding
lane
at
this
moment
and
captain
sedgewick
and
miss
nowell
wished
lister
and
her
brother
and
went
away
down
the
lane
what
a
lovely
girl
she
is
said
gilbert
when
they
were
gone
lovely
is
rather
a
strong
word
gilbert
lister
answered
coldly
she
is
certainly
pretty
but
i
hope
you
are
not
going
to
lose
your
heart
in
that
direction
there
is
no
fear
of
that
a
man
may
admire
a
girl
face
without
being
in
any
danger
of
losing
his
heart
but
why
not
in
that
direction
belle
is
there
any
special
objection
to
the
lady
only
that
she
is
a
nobody
without
either
money
or
position
and
i
think
you
ought
to
have
both
when
you
marry
thanks
for
the
implied
compliment
but
i
do
not
fancy
that
an
australian
merchant
can
expect
to
secure
a
wife
of
very
exalted
position
and
i
am
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
marry
for
money
i
do
for
a
moment
suppose
you
would
marry
any
one
you
did
like
from
mercenary
considerations
but
there
is
no
reason
you
should
make
a
foolish
match
of
course
not
i
think
it
very
doubtful
whether
i
shall
ever
marry
at
all
i
am
just
the
kind
of
man
to
go
down
to
my
grave
a
bachelor
why
so
gilbert
well
i
can
hardly
tell
you
my
dear
perhaps
i
am
rather
difficult
to
please
just
a
little
and
invulnerable
i
know
that
since
i
was
a
boy
and
got
over
my
schoolboy
love
affairs
i
have
never
seen
the
woman
who
could
touch
my
heart
i
have
met
plenty
of
pretty
women
and
plenty
of
brilliant
women
of
course
in
society
and
have
admired
them
and
there
an
end
i
have
never
seen
a
woman
whose
face
impressed
me
so
much
at
first
sight
as
the
face
of
your
friend
miss
nowell
i
am
very
sorry
for
that
but
why
belle
because
the
girl
is
a
nobody
less
than
nobody
there
is
an
unpleasant
kind
of
mystery
about
her
birth
how
is
that
her
uncle
captain
sedgewick
seems
to
be
a
gentleman
captain
sedgewick
is
very
well
but
he
is
not
her
uncle
he
adopted
her
when
she
was
a
very
little
girl
but
who
are
her
people
and
how
did
she
fall
into
his
hands
i
have
never
heard
that
he
is
not
very
fond
of
talking
about
the
subject
when
we
first
came
to
know
them
he
told
us
that
marian
was
only
his
adopted
niece
and
he
has
never
told
us
any
more
than
that
she
is
the
daughter
of
some
friend
i
suppose
they
seem
very
much
attached
to
each
other
yes
she
is
very
fond
of
him
and
he
of
her
she
is
an
amiable
girl
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
her
but
but
what
belle
i
should
like
you
to
fall
in
love
with
her
but
i
should
mamma
cried
the
damsel
in
scarlet
stockings
who
had
absorbed
every
word
of
the
foregoing
conversation
i
should
like
uncle
gil
to
love
marian
just
as
i
love
her
she
is
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
when
we
had
a
juvenile
party
last
winter
it
was
marian
who
dressed
the
every
bit
and
she
played
the
piano
for
us
all
the
evening
did
she
mamma
she
is
very
lucy
but
you
must
talk
nonsense
and
you
ought
not
to
listen
when
your
uncle
and
i
are
talking
it
is
very
rude
but
i
ca
help
hearing
you
mamma
they
were
at
home
by
this
time
within
the
grounds
of
a
handsome
house
of
the
early
georgian
era
which
had
been
the
property
of
the
listers
ever
since
it
was
built
without
the
gardens
were
a
picture
of
neatness
and
order
within
everything
was
solid
and
comfortable
the
furniture
of
a
somewhat
ponderous
and
exploded
fashion
but
handsome
withal
and
brightened
here
and
there
by
some
concession
to
modern
notions
of
elegance
or
ease
a
dainty
little
table
for
books
a
luxurious
and
so
on
martin
lister
was
a
gentleman
chiefly
distinguished
by
hospitable
instincts
and
an
enthusiastic
devotion
to
agriculture
there
were
very
few
things
in
common
between
him
and
his
the
australian
merchant
but
they
got
on
very
well
together
for
a
short
time
gilbert
fenton
pretended
to
be
profoundly
interested
in
the
thrilling
question
of
drainage
deep
or
superficial
and
seemed
to
enter
unreservedly
into
every
discussion
of
the
latest
invention
or
improvement
in
agricultural
machinery
and
in
the
mean
time
he
really
liked
the
repose
of
the
country
and
appreciated
the
varying
charms
of
landscape
and
atmosphere
with
a
fervour
unfelt
by
the
man
who
had
been
born
and
reared
amidst
those
pastoral
scenes
the
two
men
smoked
their
cigars
together
in
a
quietly
companionable
spirit
strolling
about
the
gardens
and
farm
dropping
out
a
sentence
now
and
then
and
anon
falling
into
a
lazy
reverie
each
pondering
upon
his
own
affairs
gilbert
meditating
transactions
with
foreign
houses
risky
bargains
with
traders
of
doubtful
solvency
or
hazardous
investments
in
stocks
as
the
case
might
be
the
gentleman
farmer
ruminating
upon
the
chances
of
a
good
harvest
or
the
probable
value
of
his
scotch
lister
had
preferred
lounging
about
the
farm
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
to
attendance
at
church
upon
this
particular
sunday
evening
he
had
finished
his
customary
round
of
inspection
by
this
time
and
was
sitting
by
one
of
the
open
windows
of
the
with
his
body
in
one
luxurious
chair
and
his
legs
extended
upon
another
deep
in
the
study
of
the
which
he
flung
aside
upon
the
appearance
of
his
family
well
toddlekins
he
cried
to
the
little
girl
i
hope
you
were
very
attentive
to
the
sermon
listened
for
two
and
made
up
for
your
lazy
dad
that
a
vicarious
kind
of
devotion
that
ought
to
be
permitted
occasionally
to
a
fellow
like
i
glad
you
come
back
to
give
us
some
tea
belle
do
go
upstairs
let
susan
carry
up
your
bonnet
and
shawl
it
nearly
nine
toddlekins
wants
her
tea
before
she
goes
to
bed
lucy
has
had
her
tea
in
the
nursery
said
lister
as
she
took
her
seat
before
the
cups
and
saucers
but
she
will
have
some
more
with
papa
replied
martin
who
had
an
amiable
knack
of
spoiling
his
children
there
were
only
two
this
bright
lucy
aged
nine
and
a
sturdy
boy
of
seven
they
sipped
their
tea
and
talked
a
little
about
who
had
been
at
church
and
who
had
not
been
and
the
room
was
filled
with
that
atmosphere
of
dulness
which
seems
to
prevail
in
such
households
upon
a
summer
sunday
evening
a
kind
of
palpable
emptiness
which
sets
a
man
speculating
how
many
years
he
may
have
to
live
and
how
many
such
sundays
he
may
have
to
spend
he
is
apt
to
end
by
wondering
a
little
whether
life
is
really
worth
the
trouble
it
costs
when
almost
the
best
thing
that
can
come
of
it
is
a
condition
of
comfortable
torpor
like
this
gilbert
fenton
put
down
his
cup
and
went
over
to
one
of
the
open
windows
it
was
nearly
as
dark
as
it
was
likely
to
be
that
midsummer
night
a
new
moon
was
shining
faintly
in
the
clear
evening
sky
and
here
and
there
a
solitary
star
shone
with
a
tremulous
brightness
the
shadows
of
the
trees
made
spots
of
solemn
darkness
on
the
wide
lawn
before
the
windows
and
a
warm
faint
sweetness
came
from
the
crowded
where
all
the
flowers
in
this
light
were
of
one
grayish
silvery
hue
it
almost
too
warm
an
evening
for
the
house
said
gilbert
i
think
i
take
a
stroll
i
come
with
you
old
fellow
but
i
been
all
round
the
farm
and
dead
beat
said
martin
lister
thanks
martin
i
would
think
of
disturbing
you
you
look
the
picture
of
comfort
in
that
i
shall
only
stay
long
enough
to
finish
a
cigar
he
walked
slowly
across
the
lawn
a
noble
stretch
of
level
greensward
with
dark
spreading
cedars
and
fine
old
beeches
scattered
about
it
he
walked
slowly
towards
the
gates
lighting
his
cigar
as
he
went
and
thinking
he
was
thinking
of
his
past
life
and
of
his
future
what
was
it
to
be
a
dull
hackneyed
course
of
chequered
only
by
the
dreary
vicissitudes
of
trade
and
brightened
only
by
such
selfish
pleasures
as
constitute
the
recreations
of
a
business
man
an
occasional
dinner
at
blackwall
or
richmond
a
week
shooting
in
the
autumn
a
little
hunting
in
the
winter
a
hurried
scamper
over
some
of
the
beaten
continental
roads
or
a
fortnight
at
a
german
spa
these
had
been
his
pleasures
hitherto
and
he
had
found
life
pleasant
enough
perhaps
he
had
been
too
busy
to
question
the
pleasantness
of
these
things
it
was
only
now
that
he
found
himself
away
from
the
familiar
arena
of
his
daily
life
with
neither
employment
nor
distraction
that
he
was
able
to
look
back
upon
his
career
deliberately
and
ask
himself
whether
it
was
one
that
he
could
go
on
living
without
weariness
for
the
remainder
of
his
days
he
had
been
at
this
time
a
little
more
than
seven
years
in
business
he
had
been
with
no
expectation
of
ever
having
to
take
his
place
in
the
had
been
educated
at
eton
and
oxford
and
had
been
taught
to
anticipate
a
handsome
fortune
from
his
father
all
these
expectations
had
been
disappointed
by
fenton
sudden
death
at
a
period
of
great
commercial
disturbance
the
business
was
found
in
a
state
of
entanglement
that
was
very
near
insolvency
and
wise
friends
told
gilbert
fenton
that
the
only
hope
of
coming
well
out
of
these
perplexities
lay
with
himself
the
business
was
too
good
to
be
sacrificed
and
the
business
was
all
his
father
had
left
behind
him
with
the
exception
of
a
houseful
of
handsome
furniture
two
or
three
carriages
and
a
couple
of
pairs
of
horses
which
were
sold
by
auction
within
a
few
weeks
of
the
funeral
gilbert
fenton
took
upon
himself
the
management
of
the
business
he
had
a
clear
comprehensive
intellect
which
adapted
itself
very
easily
to
commerce
he
put
his
shoulder
to
the
wheel
with
a
will
and
worked
for
the
first
three
years
of
his
business
career
as
it
is
not
given
to
many
men
to
work
in
the
course
of
their
lives
by
that
time
the
ship
had
been
steered
clear
of
all
rocks
and
quicksands
and
rode
the
commercial
waters
gallantly
gilbert
was
not
a
rich
man
but
was
in
a
fair
way
to
become
a
rich
man
and
the
name
of
fenton
stood
as
high
as
in
the
palmiest
days
of
his
father
career
his
sister
had
fortunately
married
martin
lister
some
years
before
her
father
death
and
had
received
her
dowry
at
the
time
of
her
marriage
gilbert
had
only
himself
to
work
for
at
first
he
had
worked
for
the
sake
of
his
dead
father
honour
and
repute
later
he
fell
into
a
groove
like
other
men
and
worked
for
the
love
of
not
with
any
sordid
love
of
money
but
with
that
natural
desire
to
accumulate
which
grows
out
of
a
business
career
he
was
in
an
unusually
thoughtful
humour
and
inclined
to
weigh
things
in
the
balance
with
a
doubtfulness
as
to
their
value
which
was
new
to
him
the
complete
idleness
and
emptiness
of
his
life
in
the
country
had
made
him
meditative
was
it
worth
living
that
monotonous
business
life
of
his
would
not
the
time
soon
come
in
which
its
dreariness
would
oppress
him
as
the
dulness
of
lidford
house
had
oppressed
him
his
youth
was
fast
going
nay
had
it
not
indeed
gone
from
him
for
ever
had
not
youth
left
him
all
at
once
when
he
began
his
commercial
career
and
the
pleasures
that
had
been
fresh
enough
within
the
last
few
years
were
rapidly
growing
stale
he
knew
the
german
spas
the
where
the
band
played
the
and
their
company
by
heart
though
he
had
never
stayed
more
than
a
fortnight
at
any
one
of
them
he
had
exhausted
brittany
and
the
south
of
france
in
these
rapid
scampers
skimmed
the
cream
of
their
novelty
at
any
rate
he
did
not
care
very
much
for
and
hunted
and
shot
in
a
safe
kind
of
way
with
a
view
to
the
benefit
of
his
health
which
savoured
of
old
bachelorhood
and
as
for
the
rest
of
his
pleasures
the
social
rubber
at
his
club
the
blackwall
or
richmond
dinners
it
seemed
only
custom
that
made
them
agreeable
if
i
had
gone
to
the
bar
as
i
intended
to
do
before
my
father
death
i
should
have
had
an
object
in
life
he
thought
as
he
puffed
slowly
at
his
cigar
but
a
commercial
man
has
nothing
to
hope
for
in
the
way
of
fame
nothing
to
work
for
except
money
i
have
a
good
mind
to
sell
the
business
now
that
it
is
worth
selling
and
go
in
for
the
bar
after
all
late
as
it
is
he
had
thought
of
this
more
than
once
but
he
knew
the
fancy
was
a
foolish
one
and
that
his
friends
would
laugh
at
him
for
his
folly
he
was
beyond
the
grounds
of
lidford
house
by
this
time
sauntering
onward
in
the
fair
summer
night
not
indifferent
to
the
calm
loveliness
of
the
scene
around
him
only
conscious
that
there
was
some
void
within
himself
which
these
things
could
not
fill
he
walked
along
the
road
by
which
he
and
his
sister
had
come
back
from
church
and
turned
into
the
lane
at
the
end
of
which
captain
sedgewick
had
bidden
them
good
night
he
had
been
down
this
lane
before
and
knew
that
it
was
one
of
the
prettiest
walks
about
lidford
so
there
was
scarcely
anything
strange
in
the
fact
that
he
should
choose
this
promenade
for
his
evening
saunter
the
rustic
way
wide
enough
for
a
wagon
and
with
sloping
grassy
banks
and
tall
straggling
hedges
full
of
and
honeysuckle
led
towards
a
river
a
fair
winding
stream
which
was
one
of
the
glories
of
lidford
a
little
before
one
came
to
the
river
the
lane
opened
upon
a
green
where
there
was
a
mill
and
a
miller
cottage
a
rustic
inn
and
two
or
three
other
houses
of
more
genteel
pretensions
gilbert
fenton
wondered
which
of
these
was
the
habitation
of
captain
sedgewick
concluding
that
the
officer
and
his
niece
must
needs
live
in
one
of
them
he
reconnoitred
them
as
he
went
by
the
low
over
which
he
could
see
the
pretty
lawns
and
with
clusters
of
evergreens
here
and
there
and
a
wealth
of
roses
and
seringa
one
of
them
the
prettiest
and
most
secluded
was
also
the
smallest
a
low
cottage
with
casement
windows
above
and
below
and
a
porch
overgrown
with
roses
the
house
lay
back
a
little
way
from
the
green
and
there
was
a
tiny
brook
running
beside
the
holly
hedge
that
bounded
the
garden
spanned
by
a
little
rustic
bridge
before
the
gate
pausing
just
beside
this
bridge
fenton
heard
the
joyous
barking
of
a
dog
and
caught
a
brief
glimpse
of
a
light
muslin
dress
flitting
across
the
little
lawn
at
one
side
of
the
cottage
while
he
was
wondering
about
the
owner
of
this
dress
the
noisy
dog
came
rushing
towards
the
gate
and
in
the
next
moment
a
girlish
figure
appeared
in
the
winding
path
that
went
in
and
out
among
the
gilbert
fenton
knew
that
tall
slim
figure
very
well
he
had
guessed
rightly
and
this
low
cottage
was
really
captain
sedgewick
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
a
kind
of
instinct
brought
him
to
that
precise
spot
miss
nowell
came
to
the
gate
and
stood
there
looking
out
with
a
skye
terrier
in
her
arms
gilbert
drew
back
a
little
and
flung
his
cigar
into
the
brook
she
had
not
seen
him
yet
her
looks
were
wandering
far
away
across
the
green
as
if
in
search
of
some
one
gilbert
fenton
stood
quite
still
watching
her
she
looked
even
prettier
without
her
bonnet
than
she
had
looked
in
the
church
he
thought
the
rich
hair
gathered
in
a
great
knot
at
the
back
of
the
graceful
head
the
perfect
throat
circled
by
a
broad
black
ribbon
from
which
there
hung
an
gold
cross
the
youthful
figure
by
the
girlish
muslin
dress
so
becoming
in
its
utter
simplicity
he
could
not
stand
there
for
ever
looking
at
her
pleasant
as
it
might
be
to
him
to
contemplate
the
lovely
face
so
he
made
a
little
movement
at
last
and
came
a
few
steps
nearer
to
the
gate
once
more
miss
nowell
he
said
she
looked
up
at
him
surprised
by
his
sudden
appearance
but
in
no
manner
embarrassed
fenton
i
did
not
see
you
till
this
moment
i
was
looking
for
my
uncle
he
has
gone
out
for
a
little
stroll
while
he
smokes
his
cigar
and
i
expect
him
home
every
minute
i
have
been
indulging
in
a
solitary
cigar
myself
answered
gilbert
one
is
apt
to
be
inspired
with
an
antipathy
to
the
house
on
this
kind
of
evening
i
left
the
listers
yawning
over
their
and
came
out
for
a
ramble
the
aspect
of
the
lane
at
which
we
parted
company
this
evening
tempted
me
down
this
way
what
a
pretty
house
you
have
do
you
know
i
guessed
that
it
was
yours
before
i
saw
you
indeed
you
must
have
quite
a
talent
for
guessing
not
in
a
general
way
but
there
is
a
fitness
in
things
yes
i
felt
sure
that
this
was
your
house
i
am
glad
you
like
it
she
answered
simply
uncle
george
and
i
are
very
fond
of
it
but
it
must
seem
a
poor
little
place
to
you
after
lidford
house
lidford
house
is
spacious
and
comfortable
and
commonplace
one
could
hardly
associate
the
faintest
touch
of
romance
with
such
a
place
but
about
this
one
might
fancy
anything
ah
here
is
your
uncle
i
see
captain
sedgewick
came
towards
them
surprised
at
seeing
fenton
with
whom
he
shook
hands
again
very
cordially
and
who
repeated
his
story
about
the
impossibility
of
enduring
to
stop
in
the
house
on
such
a
night
the
captain
insisted
on
his
going
with
them
however
and
he
exhibited
no
disinclination
to
linger
in
the
cottage
though
it
was
only
about
a
fourth
of
the
size
of
that
at
lidford
house
it
looked
a
very
pretty
room
in
the
lamplight
with
quaint
furniture
the
freshest
and
most
delicate
chintz
hangings
and
coverings
of
chairs
and
sofas
and
some
valuable
old
china
here
and
there
captain
sedgewick
had
plenty
to
say
for
himself
and
was
pleased
to
find
an
intelligent
stranger
to
converse
with
his
health
had
failed
him
long
ago
and
he
had
turned
his
back
upon
the
world
of
action
for
ever
but
he
was
as
cheerful
and
hopeful
as
if
his
existence
had
been
the
gayest
possible
to
man
of
course
they
talked
a
little
of
military
matters
the
changes
that
had
come
about
in
the
service
none
of
them
changes
for
the
better
according
to
the
captain
who
was
a
little
behind
the
times
in
his
way
of
looking
at
these
things
he
ordered
in
a
bottle
of
claret
for
his
guest
and
gilbert
fenton
found
himself
seated
by
the
open
looking
out
at
the
dusky
lawn
and
drinking
his
wine
as
much
at
home
as
if
he
had
been
a
visitor
at
the
captain
for
the
last
ten
years
marian
nowell
sat
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
with
the
lamplight
shining
on
her
hair
and
with
that
skye
terrier
on
her
lap
gilbert
glanced
across
at
her
every
now
and
then
while
he
was
talking
with
her
uncle
and
by
and
by
she
came
over
to
the
window
and
stood
behind
the
captain
chair
with
her
clasped
hands
resting
upon
his
shoulder
gilbert
contrived
to
engage
her
in
the
conversation
presently
he
found
her
quite
able
to
discuss
the
airy
topics
which
he
started
the
last
new
volume
of
poems
the
picture
of
the
year
and
so
on
there
was
nothing
awkward
or
provincial
in
her
manner
and
if
she
did
not
say
anything
particularly
brilliant
there
was
good
sense
in
all
her
remarks
and
she
had
a
bright
animated
way
of
speaking
that
was
very
charming
she
had
lived
a
life
of
peculiar
seclusion
rarely
going
beyond
the
village
of
lidford
and
had
contrived
to
find
perfect
happiness
in
that
simple
existence
the
captain
told
fenton
this
in
the
course
of
their
talk
i
have
not
been
able
to
afford
so
much
as
a
visit
to
london
for
my
darling
he
said
but
i
do
not
know
that
she
is
any
the
worse
for
her
ignorance
of
the
great
world
the
grand
point
is
that
she
should
be
happy
and
i
thank
god
that
she
has
been
happy
hitherto
i
should
be
very
ungrateful
if
i
were
not
uncle
george
the
girl
said
in
a
half
whisper
captain
sedgewick
gave
a
thoughtful
sigh
and
was
silent
for
a
little
while
after
this
and
then
the
talk
went
on
again
until
the
clock
upon
the
struck
the
after
ten
and
gilbert
fenton
rose
to
say
i
have
stayed
a
most
unconscionable
time
i
fear
he
said
but
i
had
really
no
idea
it
was
so
late
pray
do
hurry
away
replied
the
captain
you
ought
to
help
me
to
finish
that
bottle
marian
and
i
are
not
the
earliest
people
in
lidford
gilbert
would
have
had
no
objection
to
loiter
away
another
in
the
talking
politics
with
the
captain
or
light
literature
with
miss
nowell
but
he
knew
that
his
prolonged
absence
must
have
already
caused
some
amount
of
wonder
at
lidford
house
so
he
held
firmly
to
his
shook
hands
with
his
new
friends
holding
marian
nowell
soft
slender
hand
in
his
for
the
first
time
and
wondering
at
the
strange
magic
of
her
touch
and
then
went
out
into
the
dreamy
atmosphere
of
the
summer
night
a
changed
creature
is
this
love
at
first
sight
he
asked
himself
as
he
walked
homeward
along
the
rustic
lane
where
and
the
starry
flowers
of
the
wild
convolvulus
gleamed
whitely
in
the
uncertain
light
is
it
i
should
have
been
the
last
of
men
to
believe
such
a
thing
possible
yesterday
and
yet
i
feel
as
if
that
girl
were
destined
to
be
the
ruling
influence
of
my
future
life
why
is
it
because
she
is
lovely
surely
not
surely
i
am
not
so
weak
a
fool
as
to
be
caught
by
a
beautiful
face
and
yet
what
else
do
i
know
of
her
absolutely
nothing
she
may
be
the
shallowest
of
living
creatures
the
most
selfish
the
falsest
the
basest
no
i
do
not
believe
she
could
ever
be
false
or
unworthy
there
is
something
noble
in
her
face
something
more
than
mere
beauty
heaven
knows
i
have
seen
enough
of
that
in
my
time
i
could
scarcely
be
so
childish
as
to
be
bewitched
by
a
pair
of
gray
eyes
and
a
rosy
mouth
there
must
be
something
more
and
after
all
this
is
most
likely
a
passing
fancy
born
out
of
the
utter
idleness
and
dulness
of
this
place
i
shall
go
back
to
london
in
a
week
or
two
and
forget
marian
nowell
marian
nowell
he
repeated
the
name
with
unspeakable
tenderness
in
his
tone
a
deeper
feeling
than
would
have
seemed
natural
to
a
passing
fancy
it
was
more
like
a
symptom
of
sickening
for
life
great
fever
it
was
close
upon
eleven
when
he
made
his
appearance
in
his
where
martin
lister
was
enjoying
a
comfortable
nap
while
his
wife
stifled
her
yawns
over
a
mild
theological
treatise
he
had
to
listen
to
a
good
deal
of
wonderment
about
the
length
of
his
absence
and
was
fain
to
confess
to
an
accidental
encounter
with
captain
sedgewick
which
had
necessitated
his
going
into
the
cottage
why
what
could
have
taken
you
that
way
gilbert
a
truant
fancy
i
suppose
my
dear
it
is
as
good
a
way
as
any
other
lister
sighed
and
shook
her
head
doubtfully
what
fools
you
men
are
she
said
about
a
pretty
face
including
martin
belle
when
he
fell
in
love
with
your
fair
self
martin
did
not
stare
me
out
of
countenance
in
church
sir
but
you
have
almost
kept
us
waiting
for
prayers
the
servants
came
filing
in
martin
lister
woke
with
a
start
and
gilbert
fenton
knelt
down
among
his
sister
household
to
make
his
evening
orisons
but
his
thoughts
were
not
easily
to
be
fixed
that
night
they
wandered
very
wide
of
that
simple
family
prayer
and
made
themselves
into
a
vision
of
the
future
in
which
he
saw
his
life
changed
and
brightened
by
the
companionship
of
a
fair
young
wife
chapter
ii
marian
story
the
days
passed
and
there
was
no
more
dulness
or
emptiness
for
gilbert
fenton
in
his
life
at
lidford
he
went
every
day
to
the
cottage
on
the
green
it
was
easy
enough
to
find
some
fresh
excuse
for
each
visit
a
book
or
a
piece
of
music
which
he
had
recommended
to
miss
nowell
and
had
procured
from
london
for
her
or
something
of
an
equally
frivolous
character
the
captain
was
always
cordial
always
pleased
to
see
him
his
visits
were
generally
made
in
the
evening
and
it
was
his
delight
to
linger
over
the
pretty
little
round
table
by
the
drinking
tea
dispensed
by
marian
the
bright
room
the
lovely
face
turned
so
trustingly
to
his
these
were
the
things
which
made
that
fair
vision
of
the
future
that
haunted
him
so
often
now
he
fancied
himself
the
master
of
some
pretty
villa
in
the
suburbs
at
kingston
or
twickenham
perhaps
with
a
garden
sloping
down
to
the
water
edge
a
lawn
on
which
he
and
his
wife
and
some
chosen
friend
might
sit
after
dinner
in
the
long
summer
evenings
sipping
their
claret
or
their
tea
as
the
case
might
be
and
watching
the
last
rosy
glow
of
the
sunset
fade
and
die
upon
the
river
he
fancied
himself
with
this
girl
for
his
wife
and
the
delight
of
going
back
from
the
dull
dryasdust
labours
of
his
city
life
to
a
home
in
which
she
would
bid
him
welcome
he
behaved
with
a
due
amount
of
caution
and
did
not
give
the
young
lady
any
reason
to
suspect
the
state
of
the
case
yet
awhile
marian
was
perfectly
devoid
of
coquetry
and
had
no
idea
that
this
gentleman
constant
presence
at
the
cottage
could
have
any
reference
to
herself
he
liked
her
uncle
what
more
natural
than
that
he
should
like
that
gallant
soldier
whom
marian
adored
as
the
first
of
mankind
and
it
was
out
of
his
liking
for
the
captain
that
he
came
so
often
the
captain
however
had
not
been
slow
to
discover
the
real
state
of
affairs
and
the
discovery
had
given
him
unqualified
satisfaction
for
a
long
time
his
quiet
contentment
in
this
pleasant
simple
life
had
been
clouded
by
anxious
thoughts
about
marian
future
his
death
should
that
event
happen
before
she
married
must
needs
leave
her
utterly
destitute
the
little
property
from
which
his
income
was
derived
was
not
within
his
power
to
bequeath
it
would
pass
upon
his
death
to
one
of
his
nephews
the
furniture
of
the
cottage
might
realize
a
few
hundreds
which
would
most
likely
be
for
the
greater
part
absorbed
by
the
debts
of
the
year
and
the
expenses
of
his
funeral
altogether
the
outlook
was
a
dreary
one
and
the
captain
had
suffered
many
a
sharp
pang
in
brooding
over
it
lovely
and
attractive
as
marian
was
the
chances
of
an
advantageous
marriage
were
not
many
for
her
in
such
a
place
as
lidford
it
was
natural
therefore
that
captain
sedgewick
should
welcome
the
advent
of
such
a
man
as
gilbert
fenton
a
man
of
good
position
and
ample
means
a
thoroughly
unaffected
and
agreeable
fellow
into
the
bargain
and
quite
handsome
enough
to
win
any
woman
heart
the
captain
thought
he
watched
the
two
young
people
together
after
the
notion
of
this
thing
came
into
his
mind
and
about
the
sentiments
of
one
of
them
he
felt
no
shadow
of
doubt
he
was
not
quite
so
clear
about
the
feelings
of
the
other
there
was
a
perfect
frankness
and
ease
about
marian
that
seemed
scarcely
compatible
with
the
growth
of
that
tender
passion
which
generally
reveals
itself
by
a
certain
amount
of
reserve
and
is
more
eloquent
in
silence
than
in
speech
marian
seemed
always
pleased
to
see
gilbert
always
interested
in
his
society
but
she
did
not
seem
more
than
this
and
the
captain
was
sorely
perplexed
there
was
a
at
lidford
house
during
the
second
week
of
gilbert
acquaintance
with
these
new
friends
and
captain
sedgewick
and
his
adopted
niece
were
invited
they
are
pleasant
people
to
have
at
a
lister
said
when
she
discussed
the
invitation
with
her
husband
and
brother
so
i
suppose
they
may
as
well
come
though
i
do
want
to
encourage
your
folly
gilbert
my
folly
as
you
are
kind
enough
to
call
it
is
not
dependent
on
your
encouragement
belle
then
it
is
really
a
serious
case
i
suppose
said
martin
i
really
admire
miss
nowell
more
than
i
ever
admired
any
one
before
if
that
is
what
you
call
a
serious
case
martin
rather
like
it
i
think
the
other
answered
with
a
laugh
the
dinner
was
a
very
quiet
business
a
couple
of
country
gentlemen
with
their
wives
and
daughters
a
son
or
two
more
or
less
dashing
and
sportsmanlike
in
style
the
rector
and
his
wife
captain
sedgewick
and
miss
nowell
gilbert
had
to
take
one
of
the
portly
matrons
in
to
dinner
and
found
himself
placed
at
some
distance
from
miss
nowell
during
the
repast
but
he
was
able
to
make
up
for
this
afterwards
when
he
slipped
out
of
the
some
time
before
the
rest
of
the
gentlemen
and
found
marian
seated
at
the
piano
playing
a
dreamy
reverie
of
goria
while
the
other
ladies
were
gathered
in
a
little
knot
discussing
the
last
village
scandal
he
went
over
to
the
piano
and
stood
by
her
while
she
played
looking
fondly
down
at
the
graceful
head
and
the
white
hands
gliding
gently
over
the
keys
he
did
not
disturb
her
by
much
talk
it
was
quite
enough
happiness
for
him
to
stand
there
watching
her
as
she
played
later
when
a
couple
of
had
been
established
and
the
room
had
grown
hot
these
two
sat
together
at
one
of
the
open
windows
looking
out
at
the
moonlit
lawn
one
of
them
supremely
happy
and
yet
with
a
kind
of
undefined
sense
that
this
supreme
happiness
was
a
dangerous
thing
a
thing
that
it
would
be
wise
to
pluck
out
of
his
heart
and
have
done
with
my
holiday
is
very
nearly
over
miss
nowell
gilbert
fenton
said
by
and
by
i
shall
have
to
go
back
to
london
and
the
old
commercial
life
the
and
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
your
sister
said
you
were
very
fond
of
the
fenton
she
answered
lightly
i
daresay
if
you
would
only
confess
the
truth
you
are
heartily
tired
of
the
country
and
will
be
delighted
to
resume
your
business
life
i
should
never
be
tired
of
lidford
indeed
and
yet
it
is
generally
considered
such
a
dull
place
it
has
not
been
so
to
me
it
will
always
be
a
shining
spot
in
my
memory
different
and
distinct
from
all
other
places
she
looked
up
at
him
wondering
a
little
at
his
earnest
tone
and
their
eyes
met
his
full
of
tenderness
hers
only
shy
and
surprised
it
was
not
then
that
the
words
he
had
to
speak
could
be
spoken
and
he
let
the
conversation
drift
into
a
general
discussion
of
the
merits
of
town
or
country
life
but
he
was
determined
that
the
words
should
be
spoken
very
soon
he
went
to
the
cottage
next
day
between
three
and
four
upon
a
drowsy
summer
afternoon
and
was
so
fortunate
as
to
find
marian
sitting
under
one
of
the
at
the
end
of
the
garden
reading
a
novel
with
her
faithful
skye
terrier
in
attendance
he
seated
himself
on
a
low
by
her
side
and
took
the
book
gently
from
her
hand
i
have
come
to
spoil
your
afternoon
amusement
he
said
i
have
not
many
days
more
to
spend
in
lidford
you
know
and
i
want
to
make
the
most
of
a
short
time
the
book
is
not
particularly
interesting
miss
nowell
answered
laughing
i
go
and
tell
my
uncle
you
are
here
he
is
taking
an
afternoon
nap
but
i
know
he
be
pleased
to
see
you
do
tell
him
just
yet
said
fenton
detaining
her
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
this
afternoon
something
that
it
is
wiser
to
say
at
once
perhaps
though
i
have
been
willing
enough
to
put
off
the
hour
of
saying
it
as
a
man
may
well
be
when
all
his
future
life
depends
upon
the
issue
of
a
few
words
i
think
you
must
know
what
i
mean
miss
nowell
marian
i
think
you
can
guess
what
is
coming
i
told
you
last
night
how
sweet
lidford
had
been
to
me
yes
she
said
with
a
bright
inquiring
look
in
her
eyes
but
what
have
i
to
do
with
that
everything
it
is
you
who
have
made
the
little
country
village
my
paradise
o
marian
tell
me
that
it
has
not
been
a
fool
paradise
my
darling
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
with
an
honest
first
and
only
love
promise
that
you
will
be
my
wife
he
took
the
hand
that
lay
loosely
on
her
lap
and
pressed
it
in
both
his
own
she
withdrew
it
gently
and
sat
looking
at
him
with
a
face
that
had
grown
suddenly
pale
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
asking
she
said
you
can
not
know
captain
sedgewick
is
not
my
uncle
he
does
not
even
know
who
my
parents
were
i
am
the
most
obscure
creature
in
the
world
not
one
degree
less
dear
to
me
because
of
that
marian
only
the
dearer
tell
me
my
darling
is
there
any
hope
for
me
i
never
thought
she
faltered
i
had
no
idea
that
to
know
you
was
to
love
you
my
life
and
soul
i
have
loved
you
from
the
hour
i
first
saw
you
in
lidford
church
i
was
a
doomed
man
from
that
moment
marian
o
my
dearest
trust
me
and
it
shall
go
hard
if
i
do
not
make
your
future
life
a
happy
one
granted
that
i
am
ten
years
more
than
ten
years
your
senior
that
is
a
difference
on
the
right
side
i
have
fought
the
battle
of
life
and
have
conquered
and
am
strong
enough
to
protect
and
shelter
the
woman
i
love
come
marian
i
am
waiting
for
a
word
of
hope
and
do
you
really
love
me
she
asked
wonderingly
it
seems
so
strange
after
so
short
a
time
i
loved
you
from
that
first
evening
in
the
church
my
dear
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
she
said
slowly
and
i
am
proud
i
have
reason
to
be
proud
of
your
preference
but
i
have
known
you
such
a
short
time
i
am
afraid
to
give
you
any
promise
afraid
of
me
or
of
yourself
marian
of
myself
in
what
way
i
am
only
a
foolish
frivolous
girl
you
offer
me
so
much
more
than
i
deserve
in
offering
me
your
love
like
this
i
scarcely
know
if
i
have
a
heart
to
give
to
any
one
i
know
that
i
have
never
loved
anybody
except
my
one
friend
and
protector
my
dear
adopted
uncle
but
you
do
not
say
that
you
can
not
love
me
marian
perhaps
i
have
spoken
too
soon
after
all
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
known
you
for
a
lifetime
but
that
is
only
a
lover
fancy
i
seem
almost
a
stranger
to
you
perhaps
almost
she
answered
looking
at
him
with
clear
truthful
eyes
that
is
rather
hard
upon
me
my
dear
but
i
can
wait
you
do
not
know
how
patient
i
can
be
he
began
to
talk
of
indifferent
subjects
after
this
a
little
depressed
and
disheartened
by
the
course
the
interview
had
taken
he
felt
that
he
had
been
too
precipitate
what
was
there
in
a
fortnight
intimacy
to
justify
such
a
step
except
to
himself
with
whom
time
had
been
measured
by
a
different
standard
since
he
had
known
marian
nowell
he
was
angry
with
his
own
eagerness
which
had
brought
upon
him
this
happily
miss
nowell
had
not
told
him
that
his
case
was
hopeless
had
not
forbidden
him
to
approach
the
subject
again
nor
had
she
exhibited
any
involuntary
sign
of
aversion
to
him
surprise
had
appeared
the
chief
sentiment
caused
by
his
revelation
surprise
was
natural
to
such
girlish
inexperience
and
after
surprise
had
passed
away
more
tender
feelings
might
arise
a
latent
tenderness
unsuspected
hitherto
i
think
a
woman
can
scarcely
help
returning
a
man
love
if
he
is
only
as
thoroughly
in
earnest
as
i
am
gilbert
fenton
said
to
himself
as
he
sat
under
the
trying
to
talk
pleasantly
and
to
ignore
the
serious
conversation
which
had
preceded
that
careless
talk
he
saw
the
captain
alone
next
day
and
told
him
what
had
happened
george
sedgewick
listened
to
him
with
profound
attention
and
a
grave
anxious
face
she
did
reject
you
he
said
when
gilbert
had
finished
his
story
not
in
plain
words
but
there
was
not
much
to
indicate
hope
and
yet
i
cling
to
the
fancy
that
she
will
come
to
love
me
in
the
end
to
think
otherwise
would
be
utter
misery
to
me
i
can
not
tell
you
how
dearly
i
love
her
and
how
weak
i
am
about
this
business
it
seems
contemptible
for
a
man
to
talk
about
a
broken
heart
but
i
shall
carry
an
empty
one
to
my
grave
unless
i
win
marian
nowell
for
my
wife
you
shall
win
her
cried
the
captain
energetically
you
are
a
noble
fellow
sir
and
will
make
her
an
excellent
husband
she
will
not
be
so
foolish
as
to
reject
such
a
disinterested
affection
besides
he
added
hesitating
a
little
i
have
a
very
shrewd
notion
that
all
this
apparent
indifference
is
only
shyness
on
my
little
girl
part
and
that
she
loves
you
you
believe
that
cried
gilbert
eagerly
it
is
only
guesswork
on
my
part
of
course
i
am
an
old
bachelor
you
see
and
have
had
very
little
experience
as
to
the
signs
and
tokens
of
the
tender
passion
but
i
will
sound
my
little
girl
by
and
by
she
will
be
more
ready
to
confess
the
truth
to
her
old
uncle
than
she
would
to
you
perhaps
i
think
you
have
been
a
trifle
hasty
about
this
affair
there
is
so
much
in
time
and
custom
it
is
only
a
cold
kind
of
love
that
grows
out
of
custom
gilbert
answered
gloomily
but
i
daresay
you
are
right
and
that
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
to
have
waited
you
may
hope
everything
if
you
can
only
be
patient
said
the
captain
i
tell
you
frankly
that
nothing
would
make
me
happier
than
to
see
my
dear
child
married
to
a
good
man
i
have
had
many
dreary
thoughts
about
her
future
of
late
i
think
you
know
that
i
have
nothing
to
leave
her
i
have
never
thought
of
that
if
she
were
destined
to
inherit
all
the
wealth
of
the
rothschilds
she
could
be
no
dearer
to
me
than
she
is
ah
what
a
noble
thing
true
love
is
and
do
you
know
that
she
is
not
really
my
niece
only
a
poor
waif
that
i
adopted
fourteen
years
ago
i
have
heard
as
much
from
her
own
lips
there
is
nothing
except
some
unworthiness
in
herself
that
could
make
any
change
in
my
estimation
of
her
unworthiness
in
herself
you
need
never
fear
that
but
i
must
tell
you
marian
story
before
this
business
goes
any
farther
will
you
come
and
smoke
your
cigar
with
me
she
is
going
to
drink
tea
at
a
neighbour
and
we
shall
be
alone
they
are
all
fond
of
her
poor
child
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
come
and
in
the
meantime
you
will
try
and
ascertain
the
real
state
of
her
feelings
without
distressing
her
in
any
way
and
you
will
tell
me
the
truth
with
all
frankness
even
if
it
is
to
be
a
deathblow
to
all
my
hopes
even
if
it
should
be
that
but
i
do
not
fear
such
a
melancholy
result
i
think
marian
is
sensible
enough
to
know
the
value
of
an
honest
heart
gilbert
quitted
the
captain
in
a
more
hopeful
spirit
than
that
in
which
he
had
gone
to
the
cottage
that
day
it
was
only
reasonable
that
this
man
should
be
the
best
judge
of
his
niece
feelings
left
alone
george
sedgewick
paced
the
room
in
a
meditative
mood
with
his
hands
thrust
deep
into
his
and
his
gray
head
bent
thoughtfully
she
must
like
him
he
muttered
to
himself
why
should
not
she
like
him
generous
clever
prosperous
and
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
her
such
a
marriage
is
the
very
thing
i
have
been
praying
for
and
without
such
a
marriage
what
would
be
her
fate
when
i
am
gone
a
drudge
and
dependent
in
some
family
perhaps
tyrannised
over
and
tormented
by
a
brood
of
vulgar
children
marian
came
in
at
the
open
window
while
he
was
still
pacing
to
and
fro
with
a
disturbed
countenance
my
dear
uncle
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
going
up
to
him
and
laying
a
caressing
hand
upon
his
shoulder
i
know
you
never
walk
about
like
that
unless
you
are
worried
by
something
i
am
not
worried
my
love
only
a
little
perplexed
answered
the
captain
detaining
the
caressing
little
hand
and
planting
himself
face
to
face
with
his
niece
in
the
full
sunlight
of
the
broad
marian
i
thought
you
and
i
had
no
secrets
from
each
other
secrets
uncle
george
yes
my
dear
have
you
something
pleasant
to
tell
your
old
uncle
something
that
a
girl
generally
likes
telling
you
had
a
visitor
yesterday
afternoon
while
i
was
asleep
mr
fenton
fenton
he
has
been
here
with
me
just
now
and
i
know
that
he
asked
you
to
be
his
wife
he
did
uncle
george
and
you
did
refuse
him
marian
not
positively
uncle
george
he
took
me
so
much
by
surprise
you
see
and
i
really
do
know
how
to
refuse
any
one
but
i
think
i
ought
to
have
made
him
understand
more
clearly
that
i
meant
no
but
why
my
dear
because
i
am
sure
i
do
care
about
him
as
much
as
i
ought
to
care
i
like
him
very
well
you
know
and
think
him
clever
and
agreeable
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
that
will
soon
grow
into
a
warmer
feeling
marian
at
least
i
trust
in
god
that
it
will
do
so
why
dear
uncle
because
i
have
set
my
heart
upon
this
marriage
o
marian
my
love
i
have
never
ventured
to
speak
to
you
about
your
future
the
days
that
must
come
when
i
am
dead
and
gone
and
you
can
never
know
how
many
anxious
hours
i
have
spent
thinking
of
it
such
a
marriage
as
this
would
secure
you
happiness
and
prosperity
in
the
years
to
come
she
clung
about
him
fondly
telling
him
she
cared
little
what
might
become
of
her
life
when
he
should
be
lost
to
her
grief
must
needs
be
the
crowning
sorrow
of
her
existence
and
it
would
matter
nothing
to
her
what
might
come
afterwards
but
my
dear
love
will
make
the
greater
part
of
your
life
we
must
consider
these
things
seriously
marian
a
good
man
affection
is
not
to
be
thrown
away
rashly
you
have
known
fenton
a
very
short
time
and
perhaps
it
is
only
natural
you
should
think
of
him
with
comparative
indifference
i
did
not
say
i
was
indifferent
to
him
uncle
george
only
that
i
do
not
love
him
as
he
seems
to
love
me
it
would
be
a
kind
of
sin
to
accept
so
much
and
to
give
so
little
the
love
will
come
marian
i
am
sure
that
it
will
come
she
shook
her
head
playfully
what
a
darling
uncle
it
is
she
said
and
then
kissed
him
and
ran
away
she
thought
of
gilbert
fenton
a
good
deal
during
the
rest
of
that
day
thought
that
it
was
a
pleasant
thing
to
be
loved
so
truly
and
hoped
that
she
might
always
have
him
for
her
friend
when
she
went
out
to
drink
tea
in
the
evening
his
image
went
with
her
and
she
found
herself
making
involuntary
comparisons
between
a
specimen
of
provincial
youth
whom
she
encountered
at
her
friend
house
and
fenton
very
much
to
the
advantage
of
the
australian
merchant
while
marian
nowell
was
away
at
this
little
social
gathering
captain
sedgewick
and
gilbert
fenton
sat
under
the
smoking
their
cigars
with
a
bottle
of
claret
on
a
little
iron
table
before
them
when
i
came
back
from
india
fourteen
years
ago
on
the
began
the
captain
i
went
down
to
brighton
a
place
i
had
been
fond
of
in
my
young
days
to
recruit
it
was
in
the
early
spring
quite
out
of
the
fashionable
season
and
the
town
was
very
empty
my
lodgings
were
in
a
dull
street
at
the
extreme
east
leading
away
from
the
sea
but
within
sight
and
sound
of
it
the
solitude
and
quiet
of
the
place
suited
me
and
i
used
to
walk
up
and
down
the
cliff
in
the
dusk
of
evening
enjoying
the
perfect
loneliness
of
the
scene
the
house
i
lived
in
was
a
comfortable
one
kept
by
an
elderly
widow
who
was
a
pattern
of
neatness
and
propriety
there
were
no
children
for
some
time
no
other
lodgers
and
the
place
was
as
quiet
as
the
grave
all
this
suited
me
very
well
i
wanted
rest
and
i
was
getting
it
i
had
been
at
brighton
about
a
month
when
the
floor
over
my
head
was
taken
by
a
lady
and
her
little
girl
of
about
five
years
old
i
used
to
hear
the
child
feet
pattering
about
the
room
but
she
was
not
a
noisy
child
by
any
means
and
when
i
did
happen
to
hear
her
voice
it
had
a
very
pleasant
sound
to
me
the
lady
was
an
invalid
and
was
a
good
deal
of
trouble
my
landlady
took
occasion
to
tell
me
as
she
had
no
maid
of
her
own
her
name
was
nowell
soon
after
this
i
encountered
her
on
the
cliff
one
afternoon
with
her
little
girl
the
child
and
i
had
met
once
or
twice
before
in
the
hall
and
her
recognition
of
me
led
to
a
little
friendly
talk
between
me
and
the
mother
she
was
a
fragile
woman
who
had
once
been
very
pretty
but
whose
beauty
had
for
the
most
part
been
worn
away
either
by
or
trouble
she
was
very
young
at
the
utmost
she
told
me
that
the
little
girl
was
her
only
child
and
that
her
husband
was
away
from
england
but
that
she
expected
his
return
before
long
after
this
we
met
almost
every
afternoon
and
i
began
to
look
out
for
these
meetings
and
our
quiet
talk
upon
the
solitary
cliff
as
the
pleasantest
part
of
my
day
there
was
a
winning
grace
about
this
nowell
manner
that
i
had
never
seen
in
any
other
woman
and
i
grew
to
be
more
interested
in
her
than
i
cared
to
confess
to
myself
it
matters
little
now
and
i
may
freely
own
how
weak
i
was
in
those
days
i
could
see
that
she
was
very
ill
and
i
did
not
need
the
ominous
hints
of
the
landlady
who
had
contrived
to
question
nowell
doctor
to
inspire
me
with
the
dread
that
she
might
never
recover
i
thought
of
her
a
great
deal
and
watched
the
fading
light
in
her
eyes
and
listened
to
the
weakening
tones
of
her
voice
with
a
sense
of
trouble
that
seemed
utterly
disproportionate
to
the
occasion
i
will
not
say
that
i
loved
her
neither
the
fact
that
she
was
another
man
wife
nor
the
fact
that
she
was
soon
to
die
was
ever
absent
from
my
mind
when
i
thought
of
her
i
will
only
say
that
she
was
more
to
me
than
any
woman
had
ever
been
before
or
has
ever
been
since
it
was
the
one
sentimental
episode
of
my
life
and
a
very
brief
one
the
weeks
went
by
and
her
husband
did
not
come
i
think
the
trouble
and
anxiety
caused
by
his
delay
did
a
good
deal
towards
hastening
the
inevitable
end
but
she
bore
her
grief
very
quietly
and
never
uttered
a
complaint
of
him
in
my
hearing
she
paid
her
way
regularly
enough
for
a
considerable
time
and
then
all
at
once
broke
down
and
confessed
to
the
landlady
that
she
had
not
a
shilling
more
in
the
world
the
woman
was
a
hard
creature
and
told
her
that
if
that
was
the
case
she
must
find
some
other
lodgings
and
immediately
i
heard
this
not
from
nowell
but
from
the
landlady
who
seemed
to
consider
her
conduct
thoroughly
justified
by
the
highest
code
of
morals
she
was
a
lone
unprotected
woman
and
how
was
she
to
pay
her
rent
and
taxes
if
her
best
floor
was
occupied
by
a
tenant
i
was
by
no
means
a
rich
man
but
i
could
not
endure
to
think
of
that
helpless
dying
creature
thrust
out
into
the
streets
and
i
told
my
landlady
that
i
would
be
answerable
for
nowell
rent
and
for
the
daily
expenses
incurred
on
her
behalf
nowell
would
in
all
probability
appear
in
good
time
to
relieve
me
from
the
responsibility
but
in
the
mean
while
that
poor
soul
upstairs
was
not
to
be
distressed
i
begged
that
she
might
know
nothing
of
this
undertaking
on
my
part
it
was
not
long
after
this
when
our
daily
meetings
on
the
cliff
came
to
an
end
mild
as
the
weather
was
by
this
time
nowell
doctor
had
forbidden
her
going
out
any
longer
i
knew
that
she
had
no
maid
to
send
out
with
the
child
so
i
sent
the
servant
up
to
ask
her
if
she
would
trust
the
little
one
for
a
daily
walk
with
me
this
she
was
very
pleased
to
do
and
marian
became
my
dear
little
companion
every
afternoon
she
had
taken
to
me
as
the
phrase
goes
from
the
very
first
she
was
the
gentlest
most
engaging
child
i
had
ever
met
with
a
little
grave
for
her
years
and
tenderly
thoughtful
of
others
one
evening
nowell
sent
for
me
i
went
up
to
the
immediately
and
found
her
sitting
in
an
propped
up
by
pillows
and
very
much
changed
for
the
worse
since
i
had
seen
her
last
she
told
me
that
she
had
discovered
the
secret
of
my
goodness
to
her
as
she
called
it
from
the
landlady
and
that
she
had
sent
for
me
to
thank
me
can
give
you
nothing
but
thanks
and
blessings
she
said
i
am
the
most
helpless
creature
in
this
world
i
suppose
my
husband
will
come
here
before
i
die
and
will
relieve
you
from
the
risk
you
have
taken
for
me
but
he
can
never
repay
you
for
your
goodness
i
told
her
to
give
herself
no
trouble
on
my
account
but
i
could
not
help
saying
that
i
thought
her
husband
had
behaved
shamefully
in
not
coming
to
england
to
her
long
ere
this
knows
that
you
are
ill
i
suppose
i
said
yes
he
knows
that
i
was
ill
when
he
sent
me
home
we
had
been
travelling
about
the
continent
almost
ever
since
our
marriage
he
married
me
against
his
father
will
and
lost
all
chance
of
a
great
fortune
by
doing
so
i
did
not
know
how
much
he
sacrificed
at
the
time
or
i
should
never
have
consented
to
his
losing
so
much
for
my
sake
i
think
the
knowledge
of
what
he
had
lost
came
between
us
very
soon
i
know
that
his
love
for
me
has
grown
weaker
as
the
years
went
by
and
that
i
have
been
little
better
than
a
burden
to
him
i
could
never
tell
you
how
lonely
my
life
has
been
in
those
great
foreign
cities
where
there
seems
such
perpetual
gaiety
and
pleasure
i
think
i
must
have
died
of
the
solitude
and
dulness
the
long
dreary
summer
evenings
the
dismal
winter
days
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
darling
child
she
has
been
all
the
world
to
me
and
o
god
she
cried
with
a
look
of
anguish
that
went
to
my
heart
will
become
of
her
when
i
am
dead
and
she
is
left
to
the
care
of
a
selfish
dissipated
man
need
never
fear
that
she
will
be
without
one
friend
while
i
live
i
said
marian
is
very
dear
to
me
and
i
shall
make
it
my
business
to
watch
over
her
career
as
well
as
i
can
the
poor
soul
clasped
my
hand
and
pressed
her
feverish
lips
to
it
in
a
transport
of
gratitude
what
a
brute
a
man
must
have
been
who
could
neglect
such
a
woman
after
this
i
went
up
to
her
room
every
evening
and
read
to
her
a
little
and
cheered
her
as
well
as
i
could
but
i
believe
her
heart
was
broken
the
end
came
very
suddenly
at
last
i
had
intended
to
question
her
about
her
husband
family
but
the
subject
was
a
difficult
one
to
approach
and
i
had
put
it
off
from
day
to
day
hoping
that
she
might
rally
a
little
and
would
be
in
a
better
condition
to
discuss
business
matters
she
never
did
rally
i
was
with
her
when
she
died
and
her
last
act
was
to
draw
her
child
towards
her
with
her
feeble
arms
and
lay
my
hand
upon
the
little
one
head
looking
up
at
me
with
sorrowful
pleading
eyes
she
was
quite
speechless
then
but
i
knew
what
the
look
meant
and
answered
it
the
end
of
my
life
my
dear
i
said
shall
love
and
cherish
her
to
the
end
of
my
life
after
this
the
child
fell
asleep
in
my
arms
as
i
sat
by
the
bedside
sharing
the
long
melancholy
watch
with
the
landlady
who
behaved
very
well
at
this
sorrowful
time
we
sat
in
the
quiet
room
all
night
the
little
one
wrapped
in
a
shawl
and
nestled
upon
my
breast
in
the
early
summer
morning
lucy
nowell
died
very
peacefully
and
i
carried
marian
down
to
the
sofa
in
the
parlour
and
laid
her
there
still
asleep
she
cried
piteously
for
her
mother
when
she
awoke
and
i
had
to
tell
her
that
which
it
is
so
hard
to
tell
a
child
i
wrote
to
nowell
at
an
address
in
brussels
which
i
found
at
the
top
of
his
last
letter
to
his
wife
no
answer
came
i
wrote
again
after
a
little
while
with
the
same
result
and
in
the
mean
time
the
child
had
grown
fonder
of
me
and
dearer
to
me
every
day
i
had
hired
a
nursemaid
for
her
and
had
taken
an
upper
room
for
her
nursery
but
she
spent
the
greater
part
of
her
life
with
me
and
i
began
to
fancy
that
providence
intended
i
should
keep
her
with
me
for
the
rest
of
her
days
she
told
me
in
her
innocent
childish
way
that
papa
had
never
loved
her
as
her
mamma
did
he
had
been
always
out
of
doors
till
very
very
late
at
night
she
had
crept
from
her
little
bed
sometimes
when
it
was
morning
quite
light
and
had
found
mamma
in
the
with
no
fire
and
the
candles
all
burnt
out
waiting
for
papa
to
come
home
i
put
an
advertisement
addressed
to
percival
nowell
in
the
and
in
for
i
felt
that
the
child
future
might
depend
upon
her
father
acknowledgment
of
her
in
the
present
but
no
reply
came
to
these
advertisements
and
i
settled
in
my
own
mind
that
this
nowell
was
a
scoundrel
who
had
deliberately
deserted
his
wife
and
child
the
possessions
of
the
poor
creature
who
was
gone
were
of
no
great
value
there
were
some
rather
handsome
clothes
and
a
small
collection
of
jewelry
some
of
it
modern
the
rest
curious
and
these
latter
articles
i
kept
religiously
believing
them
to
be
family
relics
the
clothes
and
the
modern
trinkets
i
caused
to
be
sold
and
the
small
sum
realised
for
them
barely
paid
the
expense
of
the
funeral
and
grave
the
arrears
of
rent
and
all
other
arrears
fell
upon
me
i
paid
them
and
then
left
brighton
with
the
child
and
nurse
i
was
born
not
twenty
miles
from
this
place
and
i
had
a
fancy
for
ending
my
days
in
my
native
county
so
i
came
down
to
this
part
of
the
world
and
looked
about
me
a
little
living
in
lodgings
here
and
there
until
i
found
this
cottage
to
let
one
day
and
decided
upon
settling
at
lidford
and
now
you
know
the
whole
story
of
marian
adoption
fenton
how
happy
we
have
been
together
or
what
she
has
been
to
me
since
that
time
i
could
never
tell
you
the
story
does
you
credit
sir
and
i
honour
you
for
your
goodness
said
gilbert
fenton
goodness
pshaw
cried
the
captain
impetuously
it
has
been
a
mere
matter
of
on
my
part
the
child
made
herself
necessary
to
me
from
the
very
first
i
was
a
solitary
man
a
confirmed
bachelor
with
every
prospect
of
becoming
a
hard
selfish
old
fogey
marian
nowell
has
been
the
sunshine
of
my
life
you
never
made
any
farther
discoveries
about
mr
nowell
never
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
i
ought
to
have
made
some
stronger
efforts
to
place
myself
in
communication
with
him
i
have
thought
this
especially
when
brooding
upon
the
uncertainties
of
my
darling
future
from
the
little
nowell
told
me
about
her
marriage
i
had
reason
to
believe
her
husband
father
must
have
been
a
rich
man
he
might
have
softened
towards
his
grandchild
in
spite
of
his
disapproval
of
the
marriage
i
sometimes
think
i
ought
to
have
sought
out
the
grandfather
but
you
see
it
would
have
been
uncommonly
difficult
to
set
about
this
in
my
complete
ignorance
as
to
who
or
what
he
was
very
difficult
and
if
you
had
found
him
the
chances
are
that
he
would
have
set
his
face
against
the
child
marian
nowell
will
have
no
need
to
supplicate
for
protection
from
an
indifferent
father
or
a
grandfather
if
she
will
be
my
wife
heaven
grant
that
she
may
love
you
as
you
deserve
to
be
loved
by
her
captain
sedgewick
answered
heartily
he
thought
it
would
be
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
to
his
darling
to
become
this
young
man
wife
and
he
had
a
notion
that
a
simple
inexperienced
girl
could
scarcely
help
responding
to
the
hopes
of
such
a
lover
to
his
mind
gilbert
fenton
seemed
eminently
adapted
to
win
a
woman
heart
he
forgot
the
fatality
that
belongs
to
these
things
and
that
a
man
may
have
every
good
gift
and
yet
just
miss
the
magic
power
to
touch
one
woman
heart
chapter
iii
accepted
fenton
lingered
another
week
at
lidford
with
imminent
peril
to
the
safe
conduct
of
affairs
at
his
offices
in
great
helens
he
could
not
tear
himself
away
just
yet
he
felt
that
he
must
have
some
more
definite
understanding
of
his
position
before
he
went
back
to
london
and
in
the
meantime
he
pondered
with
a
dangerous
delight
upon
that
sunny
vision
of
a
suburban
villa
to
which
marian
should
welcome
him
when
his
day
work
was
done
he
went
every
day
to
the
cottage
and
he
bore
himself
in
no
manner
like
a
rejected
lover
he
was
indeed
very
hopeful
as
to
the
issue
of
his
wooing
he
knew
that
marian
nowell
heart
was
free
that
there
was
no
rival
image
to
be
displaced
before
his
own
could
reign
there
and
he
thought
that
it
must
go
hard
with
him
if
he
did
not
win
her
love
so
marian
saw
him
every
day
and
had
to
listen
to
the
captain
praises
of
him
pretty
frequently
during
his
absence
and
captain
sedgewick
talk
about
gilbert
fenton
generally
closed
with
a
regretful
sigh
the
meaning
of
which
had
grown
very
clear
to
marian
she
thought
about
her
uncle
words
and
looks
and
sighs
a
good
deal
in
the
quiet
of
her
own
room
what
was
there
she
would
not
do
for
the
love
of
that
dearest
and
noblest
of
men
marry
a
man
she
disliked
no
that
was
a
sin
from
which
the
girl
pure
mind
would
have
recoiled
instinctively
but
she
did
like
gilbert
fenton
loved
him
perhaps
though
she
had
never
confessed
as
much
to
herself
this
calm
friendship
might
really
be
love
after
all
not
quite
such
love
as
she
had
read
of
in
novels
and
poems
where
the
passion
was
always
rendered
desperate
by
the
opposing
influence
of
adverse
circumstances
and
unkind
kindred
but
a
tranquil
sentiment
a
dull
slow
smouldering
fire
that
needed
only
some
sudden
wind
of
jealousy
or
misfortune
to
fan
it
into
a
flame
she
knew
that
his
society
was
pleasant
to
her
that
she
would
miss
him
very
much
when
he
left
lidford
and
when
she
tried
to
fancy
him
reconciled
to
her
rejection
of
him
and
returning
to
london
to
transfer
his
affections
to
some
other
woman
the
thought
was
very
obnoxious
to
her
he
had
not
flattered
her
he
had
been
in
no
way
slavish
in
his
attentions
to
her
but
he
had
surrounded
her
with
a
kind
of
atmosphere
of
love
and
admiration
the
charm
of
which
no
girl
thus
beloved
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
could
be
quite
proof
against
thus
the
story
ended
as
romances
so
begun
generally
do
end
there
came
a
summer
twilight
when
gilbert
fenton
found
himself
once
more
upon
the
dewy
lawn
under
the
alone
with
marian
nowell
he
repeated
his
appeal
in
warmer
fonder
tones
than
before
and
with
a
kind
of
implied
certainty
that
the
answer
must
be
a
favourable
one
it
was
something
like
taking
the
fortress
by
storm
he
had
his
arm
round
her
slim
waist
his
lips
upon
her
brow
before
she
had
time
to
consider
what
her
answer
ought
to
be
my
darling
i
can
not
live
without
you
he
said
in
a
low
passionate
voice
tell
me
that
you
love
me
she
disengaged
herself
gently
from
his
embrace
and
stood
a
little
way
from
him
with
shy
downcast
eyelids
i
think
i
do
she
said
slowly
that
is
quite
enough
marian
cried
gilbert
joyously
i
knew
you
were
destined
to
be
my
wife
he
drew
her
hand
through
his
arm
and
took
her
back
to
the
house
where
the
captain
was
sitting
in
his
favourite
by
the
window
with
a
reading
lamp
on
the
little
table
by
his
side
and
the
newspaper
in
his
hand
your
niece
has
brought
you
a
nephew
sir
said
gilbert
the
captain
threw
aside
his
paper
and
stretched
out
both
his
hands
to
the
young
man
my
dear
boy
i
can
not
tell
you
how
happy
this
makes
me
he
cried
did
i
promise
you
that
all
would
go
well
if
you
were
patient
my
little
girl
is
wise
enough
to
know
the
value
of
a
good
man
love
i
am
very
grateful
uncle
george
faltered
marian
taking
shelter
behind
the
captain
chair
only
i
do
feel
that
i
am
worthy
of
so
much
thought
nonsense
child
not
worthy
you
are
the
best
girl
in
christendom
and
will
make
the
brightest
and
truest
wife
that
ever
made
a
man
home
dear
to
him
the
evening
went
on
very
happily
after
that
marian
at
the
piano
playing
plaintive
dreamy
melodies
with
a
tender
expressive
touch
gilbert
sitting
close
at
hand
watching
the
face
he
loved
so
dearly
an
evening
in
paradise
as
it
seemed
to
fenton
he
went
homewards
in
the
moonlight
a
little
before
eleven
thinking
of
his
new
happiness
such
perfect
happiness
without
a
cloud
the
bright
suburban
villa
was
no
longer
an
airy
castle
perhaps
never
to
be
realized
it
was
a
delightful
certainty
he
began
to
speculate
as
to
the
number
of
months
that
must
needs
pass
before
he
could
make
marian
his
wife
there
was
no
reason
for
delay
he
was
his
own
master
and
it
was
only
her
will
that
could
hinder
the
speedy
realization
of
that
sweet
domestic
dream
which
had
haunted
him
lately
he
told
his
sister
what
had
happened
next
morning
when
martin
lister
had
left
the
breakfast
table
to
hold
audience
with
his
farm
bailiff
and
those
two
were
together
alone
he
was
a
little
tired
of
having
his
visits
to
the
cottage
criticised
in
lister
somewhat
supercilious
manner
and
was
very
glad
to
be
able
to
announce
that
marian
nowell
was
to
be
his
wife
well
gilbert
exclaimed
the
matron
after
receiving
his
tidings
with
lips
and
a
generally
antagonistic
demeanour
i
can
only
say
that
if
you
must
marry
at
all
and
i
am
sure
i
thought
you
had
quite
settled
down
as
a
bachelor
with
your
excellent
lodgings
in
wigmore
street
and
every
possible
comfort
in
life
i
think
you
might
have
chosen
much
better
than
this
of
course
i
do
want
to
be
rude
or
unpleasant
but
i
can
not
help
saying
that
i
consider
any
man
a
fool
who
allows
himself
to
be
captivated
by
a
pretty
face
i
have
found
a
great
deal
more
than
a
pretty
face
to
admire
in
marian
nowell
indeed
can
you
name
any
other
advantages
which
she
possesses
amiability
good
sense
and
a
pure
and
refined
nature
what
warrant
have
you
for
all
those
things
mind
gilbert
i
like
the
girl
well
enough
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
her
but
i
can
not
help
thinking
it
a
most
unfortunate
match
for
you
how
unfortunate
the
girl
position
is
so
very
doubtful
position
echoed
gilbert
impatiently
that
sort
of
talk
is
one
of
the
consequences
of
living
in
such
a
place
as
lidford
you
talk
about
position
as
if
i
were
a
prince
of
the
whose
marriage
would
be
registered
in
every
almanac
in
the
kingdom
if
she
were
really
the
captain
niece
it
would
be
a
different
thing
harped
lister
without
noticing
this
contemptuous
interruption
but
to
marry
a
girl
about
whose
relations
nobody
knows
anything
i
suppose
even
you
have
not
been
told
who
her
father
and
mother
were
i
know
quite
enough
about
them
captain
sedgewick
has
been
candour
itself
upon
the
subject
and
are
the
father
and
mother
both
dead
miss
nowell
mother
has
been
dead
many
years
and
her
father
captain
sedgewick
does
not
know
whether
he
is
dead
or
living
ah
exclaimed
lister
with
a
profound
sigh
i
should
have
thought
as
much
and
you
are
really
going
to
marry
a
girl
with
this
disreputable
mystery
about
her
belongings
there
is
nothing
either
disreputable
or
mysterious
people
are
sometimes
lost
sight
of
in
this
world
nowell
was
a
bad
husband
and
an
indifferent
father
and
captain
sedgewick
adopted
his
daughter
that
is
all
and
no
doubt
after
you
are
married
this
nowell
will
make
his
appearance
some
day
and
be
a
burden
upon
you
i
am
not
afraid
of
that
and
now
belle
as
this
is
a
subject
upon
which
we
do
seem
very
likely
to
agree
i
think
we
had
better
drop
it
i
considered
it
only
right
to
tell
you
of
my
engagement
on
this
his
sister
softened
a
little
and
promised
gilbert
that
she
would
do
her
best
to
be
kind
to
miss
nowell
you
wo
be
married
for
some
time
to
come
of
course
she
said
i
do
know
about
that
belle
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
a
speedy
marriage
o
surely
you
will
wait
a
twelvemonth
at
least
you
have
known
marian
nowell
such
a
short
time
you
ought
to
put
her
to
the
test
in
some
manner
before
you
make
her
your
wife
i
have
no
occasion
to
put
her
to
any
kind
of
test
i
have
a
most
profound
and
perfect
belief
in
her
goodness
why
gilbert
this
is
utter
infatuation
about
a
girl
whom
you
have
only
known
a
little
more
than
three
weeks
it
does
seem
difficult
for
a
reasonable
matron
whose
romantic
experiences
are
things
of
the
remote
past
to
understand
this
sudden
trust
in
and
love
for
an
acquaintance
of
a
brief
summer
holiday
but
gilbert
fenton
believed
implicitly
in
his
own
instinct
and
was
not
to
be
shaken
he
went
back
to
town
by
the
afternoon
express
that
day
for
he
dared
not
delay
his
return
any
longer
he
went
back
regretfully
enough
to
the
dryasdust
business
life
after
spending
the
greater
part
of
the
morning
under
the
in
captain
sedgewick
garden
playing
with
fritz
the
skye
terrier
and
talking
airy
nonsense
to
marian
while
she
sat
in
a
hemming
silk
handkerchiefs
for
her
uncle
and
looking
distractingly
pretty
in
a
print
morning
dress
with
tiny
pink
rosebuds
on
a
white
ground
and
a
knot
of
pink
ribbon
fastening
the
dainty
collar
he
ventured
to
talk
a
little
about
the
future
too
painting
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
claude
melnotte
and
a
great
deal
more
sincerity
the
home
which
he
meant
to
create
for
her
you
will
have
to
come
to
town
to
choose
our
house
you
know
marian
he
said
after
a
glowing
description
of
such
a
villa
as
never
yet
existed
except
in
the
florid
imagination
of
an
auctioneer
i
could
never
venture
upon
such
an
important
step
without
you
apart
from
all
sentimental
considerations
a
woman
judgment
is
indispensable
in
these
matters
the
house
might
be
perfection
in
every
other
point
and
there
might
be
no
boiler
or
no
butler
pantry
or
no
cupboard
for
brooms
on
the
landing
or
some
irremediable
omission
of
that
kind
yes
marian
your
uncle
must
bring
you
to
town
for
a
week
or
so
of
and
soon
she
looked
at
him
with
a
startled
expression
soon
she
repeated
yes
dear
very
soon
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
to
hinder
our
marriage
why
should
we
delay
longer
than
to
make
all
necessary
arrangements
i
long
so
for
my
new
home
marian
i
have
never
had
a
home
in
my
life
since
i
was
a
boy
o
fenton
gilbert
she
pronounced
his
christian
name
shyly
and
in
obedience
to
his
reproachful
look
remember
how
short
a
time
we
have
known
each
other
it
is
much
too
soon
to
talk
or
think
of
marriage
yet
i
want
you
to
have
plenty
of
leisure
to
consider
whether
you
really
care
for
me
whether
it
is
only
a
fancy
that
will
die
out
when
you
go
back
to
london
and
we
ought
to
have
time
to
know
each
other
very
well
gilbert
to
be
quite
sure
we
are
suited
to
one
another
this
seemed
an
echo
of
his
sister
reasoning
and
vexed
him
a
little
have
any
fear
that
we
shall
not
suit
each
other
marian
he
asked
anxiously
i
know
that
you
are
only
too
good
for
me
she
answered
upon
which
gilbert
hindered
the
hemming
of
the
captain
handkerchiefs
by
stooping
down
to
kiss
the
little
hands
at
work
upon
them
and
then
the
talk
drifted
back
to
easier
subjects
and
he
did
not
again
press
that
question
as
to
the
date
of
the
marriage
at
last
the
time
came
for
going
to
the
station
he
had
arranged
for
lister
gig
to
call
for
him
at
the
cottage
so
that
he
might
spend
every
possible
moment
with
marian
and
at
three
the
gig
appeared
driven
by
martin
lister
himself
and
gilbert
was
fain
to
say
his
last
lingering
backward
glance
showed
him
the
white
figure
under
the
and
a
little
hand
waving
farewell
how
empty
and
dreary
his
comfortable
bachelor
lodgings
seemed
to
him
that
night
when
he
had
dined
and
sat
by
the
open
window
smoking
his
solitary
cigar
listening
to
the
dismal
and
the
monotonous
roll
of
ceaseless
wheels
yonder
in
not
caring
to
go
out
to
his
club
caring
still
less
for
opera
or
theatre
or
any
of
the
old
ways
whereby
he
had
been
wont
to
dispose
of
his
evenings
his
mind
was
full
of
marian
nowell
all
that
was
grave
and
earnest
in
his
nature
gave
force
to
this
his
first
love
he
had
had
flirtations
in
the
past
of
course
but
they
had
been
no
more
than
flirtations
and
at
thirty
his
heart
was
as
fresh
and
inexperienced
as
a
boy
it
pleased
him
to
think
of
marian
lonely
position
better
a
hundred
times
better
that
she
should
be
thus
than
fettered

the
faithful
and

protector
of
her
childhood
would
of
necessity
always
claim
her
love
but
beyond
this
one
affection
she
would

gilbert
only
there
would
be
no

no

absorb
her
time
and

perhaps

domestic
life

those

needs

the
petty
jars
the
overshadowing
clouds
no
bigger
than
a
man

forerunners
of
tempest
which
fenton
had
heard
of
in
many
households
he
was
never
weary
of
thinking
about
that
life
which
was
to
be
everything

thought
of
was
now
considered
only
in

to
that
one

applied
himself

new
ardour
never

been
so
anxious

chapter
iv
john
saltram
the
offices
of
fenton
and
in
great
helens
were
handsome
premises
consisting
of
two
large
outer
rooms
where
indefatigable
clerks
sat
upon
high
stools
before
ponderous
mahogany
desks
and
wrote
industriously
all
day
long
and
an
inner
and
smaller
apartment
where
there
was
a
faded
instead
of
the
kamptulicon
that
covered
the
floor
of
the
outer
offices
a
couple
of
capacious
and
a
desk
of
substantial
and
somewhat
legal
design
on
which
gilbert
fenton
was
wont
to
write
the
more
important
letters
of
the
house
in
all
the
offices
there
were
iron
safes
which
gave
one
a
notion
of
limitless
wealth
stored
away
in
the
shape
of
bonds
and
bills
if
not
actual
gold
and
and
upon
all
the
walls
there
were
coloured
and
uncoloured
engravings
of
ships
framed
and
glazed
and
catalogues
of
merchandise
that
had
been
sold
or
was
to
be
sold
hanging
loosely
one
on
the
other
besides
these
there
were
a
great
many
of
those
flimsy
papers
that
record
the
state
of
things
on
hanging
here
and
there
on
the
brass
rails
of
the
desks
from
little
hooks
in
the
walls
and
in
any
other
available
spot
and
in
all
the
premises
there
was
an
air
of
business
and
prosperity
which
seemed
to
denote
that
fenton
and
were
travelling
at
a
rapid
pace
on
the
to
fortune
gilbert
fenton
sat
in
the
inner
office
at
noon
one
day
about
a
week
after
his
return
from
lidford
he
had
come
to
business
early
that
morning
had
initialed
a
good
many
accounts
and
written
letters
already
and
had
thrown
himself
back
in
his
for
a
few
minutes
idle
musing
musing
upon
that
one
sweet
dream
of
his
new
existence
of
course
from
whatever
point
his
thoughts
started
they
always
drifted
into
that
channel
while
he
was
sitting
like
this
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
chair
tilted
upon
its
hind
legs
the
door
opened
and
a
gentleman
came
into
the
office
a
man
a
little
over
middle
height
and
powerfully
built
with
a
naturally
dark
complexion
which
had
been
tanned
still
darker
by
sun
and
wind
black
eyes
and
heavy
black
eyebrows
a
head
a
little
bald
at
the
top
and
a
face
that
might
have
been
called
almost
ugly
but
for
the
look
of
intellectual
power
in
the
broad
open
forehead
and
the
perfect
modelling
of
the
flexible
sensitive
mouth
a
remarkable
face
altogether
not
easily
to
be
forgotten
by
those
who
had
once
looked
upon
it
this
man
was
john
saltram
the
one
intimate
and
chosen
friend
of
gilbert
fenton
youth
and
manhood
they
had
met
first
at
oxford
and
had
seldom
lost
sight
of
each
other
since
the
old
university
days
they
had
travelled
a
good
deal
together
during
the
one
idle
year
that
had
preceded
gilbert
sudden
plunge
into
commerce
they
had
been
up
the
nile
together
in
the
course
of
these
wanderings
and
here
remote
from
all
civilized
aid
gilbert
had
fallen
ill
of
a
fever
a
long
tedious
business
which
brought
him
to
the
very
point
of
death
and
throughout
which
john
saltram
had
nursed
him
with
a
womanly
tenderness
and
devotion
that
knew
no
abatement
if
this
had
been
wanting
to
strengthen
the
tie
between
them
which
it
was
not
it
would
have
brought
them
closer
together
as
it
was
that
dreary
time
of
sickness
and
peril
was
only
a
memory
which
gilbert
fenton
kept
in
his
heart
of
hearts
never
to
grow
less
sacred
to
him
until
the
end
of
life
saltram
was
a
barrister
almost
a
briefless
one
at
present
for
his
habits
were
desultory
not
to
say
idle
and
he
had
not
taken
very
kindly
to
the
slow
drudgery
of
the
bar
he
had
some
money
of
his
own
and
added
to
his
income
by
writing
for
the
press
in
a
powerful
trenchant
manner
with
a
style
that
was
like
the
stroke
of
a
in
spite
of
this
literary
work
for
which
he
got
very
well
paid
saltram
generally
contrived
to
be
in
debt
and
there
were
few
periods
of
his
life
in
which
he
was
not
engaged
more
or
less
in
the
delicate
operation
of
raising
money
by
bills
of
accommodation
habit
had
given
him
quite
an
artistic
touch
for
this
kind
of
thing
and
he
did
his
work
fondly
like
some
enthusiastic
horticulturist
who
gives
his
anxious
days
to
the
budding
forth
of
some
new
orchid
or
the
production
of
a
hitherto
unobtainable
tulip
it
is
doubtful
whether
money
procured
from
any
other
source
was
ever
half
so
sweet
to
this
gentleman
as
the
cash
for
which
he
paid
sixty
per
cent
to
the
jews
with
these
proclivities
he
managed
to
rub
on
from
year
to
year
somehow
getting
about
five
hundred
per
annum
in
solid
value
out
of
an
income
of
seven
and
adding
a
little
annually
to
the
rolling
mass
of
debt
which
he
had
begun
to
accumulate
while
he
was
at
balliol
why
jack
cried
gilbert
starting
up
from
his
reverie
at
the
entrance
of
his
friend
and
greeting
him
with
a
hearty
handshaking
this
is
an
agreeable
surprise
i
was
asking
for
you
at
the
pnyx
last
night
and
joe
hawdon
told
me
you
were
away
up
the
danube
he
thought
on
a
canoe
expedition
it
is
only
under
some
utterly
impossible
dispensation
that
joseph
hawdon
will
ever
be
right
about
anything
i
have
been
on
a
walking
expedition
in
brittany
dear
boy
alone
and
have
found
myself
very
bad
company
i
started
soon
after
you
went
to
your
sister
and
only
came
back
last
night
that
scoundrel
levison
promised
me
this
afternoon
but
whether
i
shall
get
it
out
of
him
is
a
fact
only
known
to
himself
and
the
powers
with
which
he
holds
communion
and
was
the
rustic
business
pleasant
gil
did
you
take
kindly
to
the
syllabubs
and
new
milk
the
summer
sunrise
over
dewy
fields
the
pretty
and
prize
pigs
and
daily
inspections
of
the
or
did
you
find
life
rather
dull
down
at
lidford
i
know
the
place
well
enough
and
all
the
country
round
about
there
i
have
stayed
at
heatherly
with
sir
david
forster
more
than
once
for
the
shooting
season
a
pleasant
fellow
forster
in
a
dissipated
kind
of
way
always
up
to
his
eyes
in
debt
did
you
happen
to
meet
him
while
you
were
down
there
no
i
do
think
the
listers
know
him
so
much
the
better
for
them
it
is
a
vice
to
know
him
and
you
were
not
dull
at
lidford
very
far
from
it
jack
i
was
happier
there
than
i
have
ever
been
in
my
life
before
eh
gil
cried
john
saltram
that
means
something
more
than
a
quiet
fortnight
with
a
married
sister
come
old
fellow
i
have
a
vested
right
to
a
share
in
all
your
secrets
there
is
no
secret
jack
yes
i
have
fallen
in
love
if
that
what
you
mean
and
am
engaged
so
soon
that
rather
quick
work
is
it
dear
boy
i
do
think
so
what
is
that
the
poet
says
not
an
adam
at
his
birth
he
is
no
love
at
all
my
passion
sprang
into
life
after
an
hour
contemplation
of
a
beautiful
face
in
lidford
church
who
is
the
lady
o
her
position
is
not
worth
speaking
of
she
is
the
adopted
niece
of
a
captain
an
orphan
without
money
or
connections
humph
muttered
john
saltram
with
the
privileged
candour
of
friendship
not
a
very
advantageous
match
for
you
gilbert
from
a
worldly
point
of
view
i
have
not
considered
the
matter
from
that
point
of
view
and
the
lady
is
all
that
is
charming
of
course
to
my
mind
yes
very
young
nineteen
well
dear
old
follow
i
wish
you
joy
with
all
heartiness
you
can
afford
to
marry
whom
you
please
and
are
very
right
to
let
inclination
and
not
interest
govern
your
choice
whenever
i
tie
myself
in
the
bondage
of
matrimony
it
will
be
to
a
lady
who
can
pay
my
debts
and
set
me
on
my
legs
for
life
whether
such
a
one
will
ever
consider
my
ugly
face
a
fair
equivalent
for
her
specie
is
an
open
question
you
must
introduce
me
to
your
future
wife
gilbert
on
the
first
opportunity
i
shall
be
very
anxious
to
discover
whether
your
marriage
will
be
likely
to
put
an
end
to
our
friendship
there
is
no
fear
of
that
jack
that
is
a
contingency
never
to
arise
i
have
told
marian
a
great
deal
about
you
already
she
knows
that
i
owe
my
life
to
you
and
she
is
prepared
to
value
you
as
much
as
i
do
she
is
very
good
but
all
wives
promise
that
kind
of
thing
before
marriage
and
there
is
apt
to
come
a
day
when
the
familiar
bachelor
friend
falls
under
the
domestic
taboo
together
with
smoking
in
the
and
other
luxuries
of
the
old
single
life
marian
is
not
very
likely
to
prove
a
domestic
tyrant
she
is
the
gentlest
dearest
girl
and
is
very
well
used
to
bachelor
habits
in
the
person
of
her
uncle
i
do
believe
she
will
ever
extinguish
our
cigars
jack
even
in
the
i
look
forward
to
the
happiest
home
that
ever
a
man
possessed
and
it
would
be
no
home
of
mine
if
you
were
not
welcome
and
honoured
in
it
i
hope
we
shall
spend
many
a
summer
evening
on
the
lawn
jack
with
a
bottle
of
pomard
or
julien
between
us
watching
the
drowsy
old
anglers
in
their
punts
and
the
swift
outriggers
flashing
past
in
the
twilight
i
mean
to
find
some
snug
little
place
by
the
river
you
know
saltram
somewhere
about
teddington
where
the
gardens
slope
down
to
the
water
edge
very
pleasant
and
you
will
make
an
admirable
family
man
gil
you
have
none
of
the
faults
that
render
me
ineligible
for
the
married
state
i
think
your
marian
is
a
very
fortunate
girl
what
is
her
surname
by
the
way
nowell
marian
nowell
a
very
pretty
name
when
do
you
think
of
going
back
to
lidford
in
about
a
month
my
wants
me
to
go
back
to
them
for
the
of
september
then
i
think
i
shall
run
down
to
forster
and
have
a
pop
at
the
pheasants
it
will
give
me
an
opportunity
of
being
presented
to
miss
nowell
i
shall
be
very
pleased
to
introduce
you
old
fellow
i
know
that
you
will
admire
her
well
i
am
not
a
very
warm
admirer
of
the
sex
in
general
but
i
am
sure
to
like
your
future
wife
gil
if
it
is
only
because
you
have
chosen
her
and
your
own
affairs
jack
how
have
they
been
going
on
not
very
brightly
i
am
not
a
lucky
individual
you
know
destiny
and
i
have
been
at
odds
ever
since
i
was
a
schoolboy
not
in
love
yet
john
no
the
other
answered
with
rather
a
gloomy
look
he
was
sitting
on
a
corner
of
the
ponderous
desk
in
a
lounging
attitude
gazing
meditatively
at
his
boots
and
hitting
one
of
them
now
and
then
with
a
cane
he
carried
in
a
restless
kind
of
way
you
see
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
gil
he
began
at
last
as
i
told
you
just
now
if
ever
i
do
marry
mercenary
considerations
are
likely
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
business
i
do
mean
to
say
that
i
would
marry
a
woman
i
disliked
and
take
it
out
of
her
in
or
neglect
i
am
not
quite
such
a
scoundrel
as
that
but
if
i
had
the
luck
to
meet
with
a
woman
i
like
tolerably
pretty
and
agreeable
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
and
weak
enough
to
care
for
me
a
woman
with
a
handsome
fortune
i
should
be
a
fool
not
to
snap
at
such
a
chance
i
see
exclaimed
gilbert
you
have
met
with
such
a
woman
i
have
again
the
gloomy
look
came
over
the
dark
face
the
thick
black
eyebrows
contracted
in
a
frown
and
the
cane
was
struck
impatiently
against
john
saltram
boot
but
you
are
not
in
love
with
her
i
see
that
in
your
face
jack
think
me
a
sentimental
fool
i
daresay
and
fancy
i
look
at
things
in
a
new
light
now
that
i
down
a
pit
myself
but
for
god
sake
marry
a
woman
you
ca
love
tolerably
pretty
and
agreeable
wo
do
jack
that
means
indifference
on
your
part
and
depend
upon
it
when
a
man
and
woman
are
tied
together
for
life
there
is
only
a
short
step
from
indifference
to
dislike
no
gilbert
it
not
that
answered
the
other
still
moodily
contemplative
of
his
boots
i
really
like
the
lady
well
enough
love
her
i
daresay
i
have
not
had
much
experience
of
the
tender
passion
since
i
was
jilted
by
an
oxford
barmaid
whom
i
would
have
married
by
jove
but
the
truth
is
the
lady
in
question
is
free
to
marry
just
yet
there
a
husband
in
the
case
a
feeble
old
who
live
very
long
do
look
so
glum
old
fellow
there
has
been
nothing
wrong
not
a
word
that
all
the
world
might
not
hear
but
there
are
signs
and
tokens
by
which
a
man
without
any
vanity
and
heaven
knows
i
have
no
justification
for
that
may
be
sure
a
woman
likes
him
in
short
i
believe
that
if
adela
branston
were
a
widow
the
course
would
lie
clear
before
me
and
i
should
have
nothing
to
do
but
go
in
and
win
and
the
stakes
will
be
worth
winning
i
assure
you
but
this
branston
may
live
for
an
indefinite
number
of
years
during
which
you
will
be
wasting
your
life
on
a
shadow
not
very
likely
poor
old
branston
came
home
from
calcutta
a
confirmed
invalid
and
i
believe
his
sentence
has
been
pronounced
by
all
the
doctors
in
the
mean
time
he
makes
the
best
of
life
has
his
good
days
and
bad
days
and
entertains
a
great
deal
of
company
at
a
delightful
place
near
maidenhead
with
a
garden
sloping
to
the
river
like
that
you
were
talking
of
just
now
only
on
a
very
extensive
scale
you
know
how
often
i
have
wanted
you
to
run
down
there
with
me
and
how
there
has
been
always
something
to
prevent
your
going
yes
i
remember
rely
upon
it
i
shall
contrive
to
accept
the
next
invitation
come
what
may
but
i
ca
say
i
like
the
idea
of
this
prospective
kind
of
courtship
or
that
i
consider
it
quite
worthy
of
you
saltram
my
dear
gilbert
when
a
fellow
is
burdened
with
debt
and
of
a
naturally
idle
disposition
he
is
apt
to
take
rather
a
liberal
view
of
such
means
of
advancement
in
life
as
may
present
themselves
to
him
but
there
is
no
prospective
courtship
nothing
at
all
resembling
a
courtship
in
this
case
believe
me
branston
knows
that
i
like
and
admire
her
she
knows
as
much
of
almost
every
man
who
goes
to
rivercombe
for
there
are
plenty
who
will
be
disposed
to
go
in
against
me
for
the
prize
but
i
think
that
she
likes
me
better
than
any
one
else
and
that
the
chances
will
be
all
in
my
favour
from
first
to
last
there
has
not
been
a
word
spoken
between
us
which
old
branston
himself
might
not
hear
as
to
adela
marrying
again
when
he
is
gone
he
could
scarcely
be
so
fatuous
as
not
to
foresee
the
probability
of
that
is
she
pretty
very
pretty
in
rather
a
childish
way
with
blue
eyes
and
fair
hair
she
is
not
my
ideal
among
women
but
no
man
ever
marries
his
ideal
the
man
who
has
sworn
by
eyes
as
black
as
a
stormy
midnight
and
raven
hair
generally
unites
himself
to
the
most
insipid
thing
in
blondes
and
the
idolater
of
golden
locks
takes
to
wife
some
west
indian
with
an
unmistakable
dip
of
the
when
will
you
go
down
to
rivercombe
whenever
you
like
the
nabob
is
hospitality
itself
and
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
if
he
is
to
the
fore
when
you
go
i
fancy
there
is
some
kind
of
regatta
a
race
or
two
at
any
rate
on
saturday
afternoon
will
that
suit
you
very
well
indeed
then
we
can
meet
at
the
station
there
is
a
train
down
at
but
we
are
going
to
see
something
of
each
other
in
the
meantime
i
hope
i
know
that
i
am
a
sore
hindrance
to
business
at
such
an
hour
as
this
will
you
dine
with
me
at
the
pnyx
at
seven
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
you
how
i
got
on
with
levison
with
pleasure
and
so
they
parted
gilbert
fenton
to
return
to
his
and
to
the
reception
of
callers
of
a
more
commercial
and
profitable
character
john
saltram
to
loiter
slowly
through
the
streets
on
his
way
to
the
office
they
dined
together
very
pleasantly
that
evening
levison
had
proved
accommodating
for
the
nonce
and
john
saltram
was
in
high
spirits
almost
boisterously
gay
with
the
gaiety
of
a
man
for
whom
life
is
made
up
of
swift
transitions
from
brightness
to
gloom
long
intervals
of
despondency
and
brief
glimpses
of
pleasure
the
reckless
humour
of
a
man
with
whom
thought
always
meant
care
and
whose
soul
had
no
higher
aspiration
than
to
beguile
the
march
of
time
by
such
evenings
as
these
they
met
on
the
following
saturday
at
the
great
western
terminus
john
saltram
still
in
high
spirits
and
gilbert
fenton
quietly
happy
that
morning
post
had
brought
him
his
first
letter
from
marian
an
innocent
girlish
epistle
which
was
as
delicious
to
gilbert
as
if
it
had
been
the
of
a
sevigné
what
could
she
say
to
him
very
little
the
letter
was
full
of
gratitude
for
his
thoughtfulness
about
her
for
the
pretty
tributes
of
his
love
which
he
had
sent
her
the
books
and
music
and
ribbons
and
gloves
in
the
purchase
whereof
he
had
found
such
a
novel
pleasure
it
had
been
a
common
thing
for
him
to
execute
such
commissions
for
his
sister
but
it
was
quite
a
new
sensation
to
him
to
discuss
the
colours
of
gloves
and
ribbons
now
that
the
trifles
he
chose
were
to
give
pleasure
to
marian
nowell
he
knew
every
tint
that
harmonised
or
contrasted
best
with
that
clear
olive
complexion
the
brilliant
blue
that
gave
new
brightness
to
the
sparkling
grey
eyes
the
pink
that
cast
warm
lights
upon
the
throat
and
chin
and
he
found
a
childish
delight
in
these
trivialities
there
was
one
ribbon
he
selected
for
her
at
this
time
which
he
had
strange
reason
to
remember
in
the
days
to
come
a
narrow
blue
ribbon
with
tiny
pink
rosebuds
upon
it
a
daring
mixture
of
the
two
colours
he
had
the
letter
in
the
of
his
coat
when
he
met
john
saltram
at
the
station
and
entertained
that
gentleman
with
certain
passages
from
it
as
they
sped
down
to
maidenhead
to
which
passages
saltram
listened
kindly
with
a
very
vague
notion
of
the
writer
i
am
afraid
she
is
rather
a
person
he
thought
with
nothing
but
her
beauty
to
recommend
her
that
wonderful
gift
of
beauty
has
such
power
to
bewitch
the
most
sensible
man
upon
occasion
they
chartered
a
fly
at
maidenhead
and
drove
about
a
mile
and
a
half
along
a
pleasant
road
before
they
came
to
the
gates
of
rivercombe
a
low
straggling
house
with
verandahs
over
which
trailed
a
wealth
of
flowering
creepers
and
innumerable
windows
opening
to
the
ground
the
gardens
were
perfection
not
gardens
of
yesterday
with
only
the
prim
splendours
of
modern
horticulture
to
recommend
them
but
spreading
lawns
on
which
the
deep
springy
turf
had
been
growing
a
hundred
years
lawns
made
delicious
in
summer
time
by
the
cool
umbrage
of
old
fertile
screened
from
the
biting
of
adverse
winds
by
tall
hedges
of
holly
and
yew
the
angles
whereof
were
embellished
by
vases
and
peacocks
quaintly
cut
in
the
style
of
a
bygone
age
and
for
chief
glory
of
all
the
bright
blue
river
which
made
the
principal
boundary
of
the
place
washing
the
edge
of
the
wide
sloping
lawn
and
making
perpetual
music
on
a
summer
day
with
its
joyous
ripple
there
was
a
good
deal
of
company
already
scattered
about
the
lawn
when
john
saltram
and
his
friend
were
ushered
into
the
pretty
the
cheerful
sound
of
came
from
a
level
stretch
of
grass
visible
from
the
windows
and
quite
a
little
fleet
of
boats
were
jostling
one
another
at
the
landing
by
the
swiss
branston
came
in
from
the
garden
to
welcome
them
looking
very
pretty
in
a
coquettish
little
hat
with
a
scarlet
feather
and
a
silk
dress
looped
up
over
an
muslin
petticoat
she
was
a
slender
little
woman
with
a
brilliant
complexion
sunny
waving
hair
and
innocent
blue
eyes
the
sort
of
woman
whom
a
man
would
wish
to
shelter
from
all
the
storms
of
life
but
whom
he
might
scarcely
care
to
choose
for
the
companion
of
a
perilous
voyage
she
professed
herself
very
much
pleased
to
see
gilbert
fenton
i
have
heard
so
much
of
you
from
saltram
she
said
he
is
always
praising
you
i
believe
he
cares
more
for
you
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
i
have
not
many
people
to
care
for
answered
john
saltram
and
gilbert
is
a
friend
of
long
standing
a
sentimental
expression
came
over
branston
girlish
face
and
she
gave
a
little
regretful
sigh
i
am
sorry
you
will
not
see
my
husband
she
said
after
a
brief
pause
it
is
one
of
his
bad
days
the
two
gentlemen
both
expressed
their
regret
upon
this
subject
and
then
they
went
out
to
the
lawn
with
branston
and
joined
the
group
by
the
who
were
waiting
for
the
race
here
gilbert
found
some
pleasant
people
to
talk
to
while
adela
branston
and
john
saltram
strolled
as
if
by
accident
to
a
seat
a
little
way
apart
from
the
rest
and
sat
there
talking
in
a
confidential
manner
which
might
not
really
constitute
a
flirtation
but
which
had
rather
that
appearance
to
the
eye
of
the
ignorant
observer
the
boats
came
flashing
by
at
last
and
there
was
the
usual
excitement
amongst
the
spectators
but
it
seemed
to
gilbert
that
branston
found
more
interest
in
john
saltram
conversation
than
in
the
race
it
is
possible
she
had
seen
too
many
such
contests
to
care
much
for
the
result
of
this
one
she
scarcely
looked
up
as
the
boats
shot
by
but
sat
with
her
little
gloved
hands
clasped
upon
her
knee
and
her
bright
face
turned
towards
john
saltram
they
all
went
into
the
house
at
about
seven
after
a
good
deal
of
croquet
and
flirtation
and
found
a
kind
of
banquet
half
tea
half
luncheon
but
very
substantial
after
its
kind
waiting
for
them
in
the
long
low
branston
was
very
popular
as
a
hostess
and
had
a
knack
of
bringing
pleasant
people
round
her
journalists
and
musical
men
clever
young
painters
who
were
beginning
to
make
their
mark
in
the
pretty
girls
who
could
sing
or
play
well
or
talk
more
or
less
brilliantly
against
nonentities
of
all
kinds
adela
branston
set
her
face
and
had
a
polite
way
of
dropping
people
from
whom
she
derived
no
amusement
pleading
in
her
pretty
childish
way
that
it
was
so
much
more
pleasant
for
all
parties
that
this
mundane
existence
of
ours
was
not
intended
to
be
all
pleasure
was
an
idea
that
never
yet
troubled
adela
branston
mind
she
had
been
petted
and
spoiled
by
everyone
about
her
from
the
beginning
of
her
brief
life
and
had
passed
from
the
frivolous
career
of
a
to
a
position
of
wealth
and
independence
as
michael
branston
wife
fully
believing
that
in
making
the
sacrifice
involved
in
marrying
a
man
forty
years
her
senior
she
earned
the
right
to
take
her
own
pleasure
and
to
gratify
every
caprice
of
her
infantile
mind
for
the
remainder
of
her
days
she
was
supremely
selfish
in
an
agreeable
unconscious
fashion
and
considered
herself
a
domestic
martyr
whenever
she
spent
an
hour
in
her
husband
listening
to
his
peevish
accounts
of
his
maladies
or
reading
a
leader
on
the
threatening
aspect
of
things
in
the
city
for
the
solace
of
his
loneliness
and
pain
the
popping
of
corks
sounded
merrily
amidst
the
buzz
of
conversation
and
great
antique
silver
tankards
of
badminton
and
moselle
cup
were
emptied
as
by
magic
none
knowing
how
except
the
grave
butler
whose
omniscient
eye
reigned
above
the
pleasant
confusion
of
the
scene
and
after
about
an
hour
and
a
half
wasted
in
this
agreeable
indoor
picnic
branston
and
her
friends
adjourned
to
the
where
the
grand
piano
had
been
pushed
into
a
conspicuous
position
and
where
the
musical
business
of
the
evening
speedily
began
it
was
very
pleasant
sitting
by
the
open
windows
in
the
summer
twilight
with
no
artificial
light
in
the
room
except
the
wax
candles
on
the
piano
listening
to
good
music
and
talking
a
little
now
and
then
in
that
subdued
confidential
tone
to
which
music
makes
such
an
agreeable
accompaniment
adela
branston
sat
in
the
midst
of
a
group
in
a
wide
bay
window
and
although
john
saltram
was
standing
near
her
chair
he
did
not
this
time
engage
the
whole
of
her
attention
gilbert
found
himself
seated
next
a
very
animated
young
lady
who
rather
bored
him
with
her
raptures
about
the
music
and
who
seemed
to
have
assisted
at
every
morning
and
evening
concert
that
had
been
given
within
the
last
two
years
to
any
remoter
period
her
memory
did
not
extend
and
she
implied
that
she
had
been
before
that
time
in
a
chrysalis
or
condition
she
told
fenton
with
an
air
of
innocent
wonder
that
she
had
heard
there
were
people
living
who
remembered
the
first
appearance
of
jenny
lind
a
little
before
ten
there
was
a
general
movement
for
the
rail
the
greater
number
of
branston
guests
having
come
from
town
there
was
a
scarcity
of
flys
at
this
juncture
so
john
saltram
and
gilbert
fenton
walked
back
to
the
station
in
the
moonlight
well
gilbert
old
fellow
what
do
you
think
of
the
lady
saltram
asked
when
they
were
a
little
way
beyond
the
gates
of
rivercombe
i
think
her
very
pretty
jack
and
well
yes
upon
the
whole
fascinating
but
i
do
like
the
look
of
the
thing
altogether
and
i
fancy
there
considerable
bad
taste
in
giving
parties
with
an
invalid
husband
upstairs
i
was
wondering
how
branston
liked
the
noise
of
all
that
talk
and
laughter
in
the
or
the
music
that
came
afterwards
my
dear
fellow
old
branston
delights
in
society
he
is
generally
well
enough
to
sit
in
the
and
look
on
at
his
wife
parties
he
does
talk
much
on
those
occasions
indeed
i
believe
he
is
quite
incapable
of
conversing
about
anything
except
the
rise
and
fall
of
indian
stock
or
the
fluctuations
in
the
value
of
indigo
and
you
see
adela
married
him
with
the
intention
of
enjoying
her
life
she
confesses
as
much
sometimes
with
perfect
candour
i
daresay
she
is
very
candid
and
just
as
shallow
said
gilbert
fenton
who
was
inclined
to
set
his
face
against
this
entanglement
of
his
friend
well
yes
i
suppose
she
is
rather
shallow
those
pretty
pleasant
little
women
generally
are
i
think
depth
of
feeling
and
force
of
mind
are
so
apt
to
go
along
with
blue
spectacles
and
a
rugged
aspect
a
prettiness
must
stand
for
something
there
is
so
much
real
pleasure
in
the
contemplation
of
a
charming
face
that
a
man
had
need
rescind
a
little
in
the
way
of
mental
qualifications
and
i
do
not
think
adela
branston
is
without
a
heart
you
praise
her
very
warmly
are
you
really
in
love
with
her
john
his
friend
asked
seriously
no
gilbert
upon
my
honour
i
heartily
wish
i
were
i
wish
i
could
give
her
more
when
death
brings
about
her
release
from
michael
branston
than
the
kind
of
liking
i
feel
for
her
no
i
am
not
in
love
with
her
but
i
think
she
likes
me
and
a
man
must
be
something
worse
than
a
brute
if
he
is
not
grateful
for
a
pretty
woman
regard
they
said
no
more
about
branston
gilbert
had
a
strong
distaste
for
the
business
but
he
did
not
care
to
take
upon
himself
the
office
of
mentor
to
a
friend
whose
will
he
knew
to
be
much
stronger
than
his
own
and
to
whose
domination
he
had
been
apt
to
submit
in
most
things
as
to
the
influence
of
a
superior
mind
it
disappointed
him
a
little
to
find
that
john
saltram
was
capable
of
making
a
mercenary
marriage
capable
even
of
the
greater
baseness
involved
in
the
anticipation
of
a
dead
shoes
but
his
heart
was
not
easily
to
be
turned
against
the
chosen
friend
of
his
youth
and
he
was
prompt
in
making
excuses
for
the
line
of
conduct
he
disapproved
chapter
halcyon
days
it
was
still
quite
early
in
september
when
gilbert
fenton
went
back
to
lidford
and
took
up
his
quarters
once
more
in
the
airy
bedchamber
set
apart
for
him
in
his
sister
house
he
had
devoted
himself
very
resolutely
to
business
during
the
interval
that
had
gone
by
since
his
last
visit
to
that
quiet
country
house
but
the
time
had
seemed
very
long
to
him
and
he
fancied
himself
a
kind
of
martyr
to
the
necessities
of
commerce
the
aspect
of
his
affairs
of
late
had
not
been
quite
free
from
unpleasantness
there
were
difficulties
in
the
conduct
of
business
in
the
melbourne
branch
of
the
house
that
branch
which
was
under
the
charge
of
a
cousin
of
gilbert
about
whose
business
capacities
the
late
fenton
had
entertained
the
most
exalted
opinion
the
melbourne
trading
had
not
of
late
done
much
credit
to
this
gentleman
commercial
genius
he
had
put
his
trust
in
firms
that
had
crumbled
to
pieces
before
the
bills
drawn
upon
them
came
due
involving
his
cousin
in
considerable
losses
gilbert
was
rich
enough
to
stand
these
losses
however
and
he
reconciled
himself
to
them
as
best
he
might
taking
care
to
send
his
australian
partner
imperative
instructions
for
a
more
prudent
system
of
trading
in
the
future
the
uneasiness
and
vexation
produced
by
this
business
was
still
upon
him
when
he
went
down
to
lidford
but
he
relied
upon
marian
nowell
presence
to
dissipate
all
his
care
he
did
find
himself
perfectly
happy
in
her
society
he
was
troubled
by
no
doubts
as
to
her
affection
for
him
no
uncertainty
as
to
the
brightness
of
the
days
that
were
to
come
her
manner
seemed
to
him
all
that
a
man
could
wish
in
the
future
partner
of
his
life
an
innocent
trustfulness
in
his
superior
judgment
a
childlike
submission
to
his
will
which
marian
displayed
upon
all
occasions
were
alike
flattering
and
delightful
nor
did
she
ever
appear
to
grow
tired
of
that
talk
of
their
future
which
was
so
pleasant
to
her
lover
there
was
no
shadow
of
doubt
upon
her
face
when
he
spoke
of
the
serene
happiness
which
they
two
were
to
find
in
an
existence
spent
together
he
was
the
first
who
had
ever
spoken
to
her
of
these
things
and
she
listened
to
him
with
an
utter
simplicity
and
freshness
of
mind
time
had
reconciled
isabella
lister
to
her
brother
choice
and
she
now
deigned
to
smile
upon
the
lovers
very
much
to
gilbert
satisfaction
he
had
been
too
proud
to
supplicate
her
good
graces
but
he
was
pleased
that
his
only
sister
should
show
herself
gracious
and
affectionate
to
the
girl
he
loved
so
fondly
during
this
second
visit
of
his
therefore
marian
came
very
often
to
lidford
house
sometimes
accompanied
by
her
uncle
sometimes
alone
and
there
was
perfect
harmony
between
the
elder
and
younger
lady
the
partridges
upon
martin
lister
estate
did
not
suffer
much
damage
from
his
gun
that
autumn
gilbert
found
it
a
great
deal
pleasanter
to
spend
his
mornings
dawdling
in
the
little
cottage
or
under
the
with
marian
than
to
waste
his
noontide
hours
in
the
endeavour
to
fill
a
creditable
there
is
not
very
much
to
tell
of
the
hours
which
those
two
spent
together
so
happily
it
was
an
innocent
frivolous
useless
employment
of
time
and
left
little
trace
behind
it
except
in
the
heart
of
one
of
those
two
gilbert
wondered
at
himself
when
in
some
sober
interval
of
reflection
he
happened
to
consider
those
idle
mornings
those
tranquil
uneventful
afternoons
and
evenings
remembering
what
a
devoted
man
of
business
he
had
once
been
and
how
a
few
months
ago
he
would
have
denounced
such
a
life
in
another
well
he
said
to
himself
with
a
happy
laugh
a
man
can
take
this
fever
but
once
in
his
life
and
it
is
only
wise
in
him
to
surrender
himself
utterly
to
the
divine
delirium
i
shall
have
no
excuse
for
neglecting
business
when
my
little
wife
and
i
are
settled
down
together
for
the
rest
of
our
days
let
me
be
her
lover
while
i
may
can
i
ever
be
less
than
her
lover
i
wonder
will
marriage
or
custom
or
the
assurance
that
we
belong
to
each
other
for
the
rest
of
our
days
take
the
poetry
out
of
our
lives
i
think
not
i
think
marian
must
always
be
to
me
what
she
has
seemed
to
me
from
the
very
first
something
better
and
brighter
than
the
common
things
of
this
life
custom
which
made
marian
nowell
dearer
to
gilbert
fenton
every
day
had
by
this
time
familiarised
her
with
his
position
as
her
future
husband
she
was
no
longer
surprised
or
distressed
when
he
pleaded
for
a
short
engagement
and
a
speedy
realization
of
that
utopian
home
which
they
were
to
inhabit
together
the
knowledge
of
her
uncle
delight
in
this
engagement
of
hers
might
have
reconciled
her
to
it
even
if
she
had
not
loved
gilbert
fenton
and
she
told
herself
that
she
did
love
him
or
more
often
putting
the
matter
in
the
form
of
a
question
asked
herself
whether
she
could
be
so
basely
ungrateful
as
not
to
love
one
who
regarded
her
with
such
disinterested
affection
it
was
settled
finally
after
a
good
deal
of
pleasant
discussion
that
the
wedding
should
take
place
early
in
the
coming
spring
at
latest
in
april
even
this
seemed
a
long
delay
to
gilbert
but
he
submitted
to
it
as
an
inevitable
concession
to
the
superior
instinct
of
his
betrothed
which
harmonised
so
well
with
lister
ideas
of
wisdom
and
propriety
there
was
the
house
to
be
secured
too
so
that
he
might
have
a
fitting
home
to
which
to
take
his
darling
when
their
honeymoon
was
over
and
as
he
had
no
female
relation
in
london
who
could
take
the
care
of
furnishing
this
earthly
paradise
off
his
hands
he
felt
that
the
whole
business
must
devolve
upon
himself
and
could
not
be
done
without
time
captain
sedgewick
promised
to
bring
marian
to
town
for
a
fortnight
in
october
in
order
that
she
might
assist
her
lover
in
that
delightful
duty
of
she
looked
forward
to
this
visit
with
quite
a
childlike
pleasure
her
life
at
lidford
had
been
completely
happy
but
it
was
a
monotonous
kind
of
happiness
and
the
notion
of
going
about
london
even
at
the
dullest
time
of
the
year
was
very
delightful
to
her
the
weather
happened
to
be
especially
fine
that
september
it
was
the
brightest
month
of
the
year
and
the
lovers
took
long
rambles
together
in
the
woodland
roads
and
lanes
about
lidford
sometimes
alone
more
often
with
the
captain
who
was
a
very
fair
pedestrian
in
spite
of
having
had
a
bullet
or
two
through
his
legs
in
the
days
gone
by
when
the
weather
was
too
warm
for
walking
gilbert
borrowed
martin
lister
and
drove
them
on
long
journeys
of
exploration
to
remote
villages
or
to
the
cheery
little
ten
miles
away
they
all
three
set
out
for
a
walk
one
afternoon
when
gilbert
had
been
about
a
fortnight
at
lidford
with
no
particular
destination
only
bent
on
enjoying
the
lovely
weather
and
the
rustic
beauty
of
woodland
and
meadow
the
captain
chose
their
route
as
he
always
did
on
these
occasions
and
under
his
guidance
they
followed
the
for
some
distance
and
then
turned
aside
into
a
wood
in
which
gilbert
fenton
had
never
been
before
he
said
so
with
an
expression
of
surprise
at
the
beauty
of
the
place
where
the
fern
grew
deep
under
giant
oaks
and
beeches
and
where
the
mossy
ground
dipped
suddenly
down
to
a
deep
still
pool
which
reflected
the
sunlit
sky
through
a
break
in
the
dark
foliage
that
sheltered
it
what
have
you
never
been
here
exclaimed
the
captain
then
you
have
never
seen
heatherly
i
suppose
never
by
the
way
is
not
that
sir
david
forster
place
asked
gilbert
remembering
john
saltram
promise
he
had
seen
very
little
more
of
his
friend
after
that
visit
to
rivercombe
and
had
half
forgotten
saltram
talk
of
coming
down
to
this
neighbourhood
on
purpose
to
be
presented
to
marian
yes
it
is
something
of
a
too
and
we
think
a
good
deal
of
it
in
these
parts
there
are
some
fine
sir
joshuas
among
the
family
portraits
painted
in
the
days
when
the
forsters
were
better
off
and
of
more
importance
in
the
county
than
they
are
now
and
there
are
a
few
other
good
pictures
dutch
interiors
and
some
seascapes
by
bakhuysen
decidedly
you
ought
to
see
heatherly
shall
we
push
on
there
this
afternoon
is
it
far
from
here
not
much
more
than
a
mile
this
wood
joins
the
park
and
there
is
a
public
right
of
way
across
the
park
to
the
lidford
road
so
the
gate
is
always
open
we
ca
waste
our
walk
and
i
know
sir
david
quite
well
enough
to
ask
him
to
let
you
see
the
pictures
if
he
should
happen
to
be
at
home
i
should
like
it
of
all
things
said
gilbert
eagerly
my
friend
john
saltram
knows
this
sir
david
forster
and
he
talked
of
being
down
here
at
this
time
i
forgot
all
about
it
till
you
spoke
of
heatherly
just
now
i
have
a
knack
of
forgetting
things
i
wonder
that
you
should
forget
anything
connected
with
saltram
gilbert
said
marian
that
saltram
of
whom
you
think
so
much
i
can
not
tell
you
how
anxious
i
am
to
see
what
kind
of
person
he
is
not
handsome
you
have
confessed
as
much
as
that
yes
marian
i
admit
the
painful
fact
there
are
people
who
call
john
saltram
ugly
but
his
face
is
not
a
common
one
it
is
a
very
picturesque
kind
of
ugliness
a
face
that
velasquez
would
have
loved
to
paint
i
think
it
is
a
rugged
countenance
with
a
villanously
dark
complexion
but
the
eyes
are
very
fine
the
mouth
perfection
and
there
is
a
look
of
power
in
the
face
that
to
my
mind
is
better
than
beauty
and
i
think
you
owned
that
saltram
is
hardly
the
most
agreeable
person
in
the
world
well
no
he
is
not
what
one
could
well
call
an
eminently
agreeable
person
and
yet
he
exercises
a
good
deal
of
influence
over
the
men
he
knows
without
admitting
many
of
them
to
his
friendship
he
is
very
clever
not
a
brilliant
talker
by
any
means
except
on
rare
occasions
when
he
chooses
to
give
full
swing
to
his
powers
he
does
not
lay
himself
out
for
social
successes
but
he
is
a
man
who
seems
to
know
more
of
every
subject
than
the
men
about
him
i
doubt
if
he
will
ever
succeed
at
the
bar
he
has
so
little
perseverance
or
steadiness
and
indulges
in
such
an
erratic
desultory
mode
of
life
but
he
has
made
his
mark
in
literature
already
and
i
think
he
might
become
a
great
man
if
he
chose
whether
he
ever
will
choose
is
a
doubtful
question
i
am
afraid
he
must
be
rather
a
dissipated
dangerous
kind
of
person
said
marian
well
yes
he
is
subject
to
occasional
outbreaks
of
dissipation
they
do
last
long
and
they
seem
to
leave
not
the
faintest
impression
upon
his
herculean
constitution
but
of
course
that
sort
of
thing
does
more
or
less
injury
to
a
man
mind
however
comparatively
harmless
the
form
of
his
dissipation
may
be
there
are
very
few
men
whom
john
saltram
can
not
drink
under
the
table
and
rise
with
a
steady
brain
himself
when
the
wassail
is
ended
yet
i
believe
in
a
general
way
few
men
drink
less
than
he
does
at
cards
he
is
equally
strong
a
in
all
games
of
skill
and
the
play
is
apt
to
be
rather
high
at
one
or
two
of
the
clubs
he
belongs
to
he
has
a
wonderful
power
of
when
he
cares
to
exert
it
will
play
six
or
seven
hours
every
night
for
three
weeks
at
a
stretch
and
then
not
touch
a
card
for
six
months
poor
old
john
said
gilbert
fenton
with
a
sigh
under
happy
circumstances
he
might
be
such
a
good
man
but
i
fear
he
is
a
dangerous
friend
for
you
gilbert
exclaimed
marian
horrified
by
this
glimpse
of
bachelor
life
no
darling
i
have
never
shared
his
wilder
pleasures
there
are
a
few
chosen
spirits
with
whom
he
consorts
at
such
times
i
believe
this
sir
david
forster
is
one
of
them
sir
david
has
the
reputation
of
leading
rather
a
wild
life
in
london
said
the
captain
and
of
bringing
a
dissipated
set
down
here
every
autumn
things
have
not
gone
well
with
him
his
wife
who
was
a
very
beautiful
girl
and
whom
he
passionately
loved
was
killed
by
a
fall
from
her
horse
a
few
months
after
the
birth
of
her
first
child
the
child
died
too
and
the
double
loss
ruined
sir
david
he
used
to
spend
the
greater
part
of
his
life
at
heatherly
and
was
a
general
favourite
among
the
county
people
but
since
that
time
he
has
avoided
the
place
except
during
the
shooting
season
he
has
a
in
the
shires
and
is
a
regular
daredevil
over
a
big
country
they
tell
me
they
had
reached
the
little
gate
opening
from
the
wood
into
the
park
by
this
time
there
was
not
much
difference
in
the
aspect
of
the
sylvan
scene
upon
the
other
side
of
the
fence
sir
david
domain
had
been
a
good
deal
neglected
of
late
years
and
the
brushwood
and
brambles
grew
thick
under
the
noble
old
trees
the
timber
had
not
yet
suffered
by
its
owner
improvidence
the
end
of
all
things
must
have
come
for
sir
david
before
he
would
have
consented
to
the
spoliation
of
a
place
he
fondly
loved
little
as
he
had
cared
to
inhabit
it
since
the
day
that
shattered
all
that
was
brightest
and
best
in
his
life
for
some
time
captain
sedgewick
and
his
companions
went
along
a
footpath
under
the
shelter
of
the
trees
and
then
emerged
upon
a
wide
stretch
of
smooth
turf
across
which
they
commanded
a
perfect
view
of
the
principal
front
of
the
old
house
it
was
a
quadrangular
building
of
the
elizabethan
period
very
plainly
built
and
with
no
special
beauty
to
recommend
it
to
the
lover
of
the
picturesque
whatever
charm
of
form
it
may
have
possessed
in
the
past
had
been
ruthlessly
extirpated
by
the
modernisation
of
the
windows
which
were
now
all
of
one
size
and
form
a
long
gaunt
range
of
unsheltered
casements
staring
blankly
out
upon
the
spectator
there
were
no
no
terraced
walks
or
graceful
flights
of
steps
before
the
house
only
a
bare
grassplot
with
a
stiff
line
of
tall
elms
on
each
side
and
a
wide
dry
moat
dividing
it
from
the
turf
in
the
park
two
lodges
ponderous
square
brick
buildings
with
very
small
windows
each
the
exact
counterpart
of
the
other
and
a
marvel
of
substantial
ugliness
kept
guard
over
a
pair
of
tall
iron
gates
about
six
hundred
yards
apart
approached
by
stone
bridges
that
spanned
the
moat
captain
sedgewick
rang
a
bell
hanging
by
the
side
of
one
of
these
gates
whereat
there
arose
a
shrill
peal
that
set
the
rooks
screaming
in
the
tall
elms
overhead
an
elderly
female
appeared
in
answer
to
this
summons
and
opened
the
gate
in
a
slow
mechanical
way
without
the
faintest
show
of
interest
in
the
people
about
to
enter
and
looking
as
if
she
would
have
admitted
a
gang
of
obvious
burglars
with
equal
indifference
rather
a
hideous
style
of
place
said
gilbert
as
they
walked
towards
the
house
but
i
think
as
a
general
rule
excel
in
ugliness
i
daresay
the
owners
of
them
find
a
dismal
kind
of
satisfaction
in
considering
the
depressing
influence
their
dreary
piles
of
must
exercise
on
the
minds
of
strangers
may
be
a
sort
of
compensation
for
being
obliged
to
live
in
such
a
gaol
of
a
place
there
was
a
clumsy
low
stone
portico
over
the
door
wide
enough
to
admit
a
carriage
and
lounging
upon
a
bench
under
this
stony
shelter
they
found
a
who
informed
captain
sedgewick
that
sir
david
was
at
heatherly
but
that
he
was
out
shooting
with
his
friends
at
this
present
moment
in
his
absence
the
man
would
be
very
happy
to
show
the
house
to
captain
sedgewick
and
his
party
gilbert
fenton
asked
about
john
saltram
yes
saltram
had
arrived
at
heatherly
on
tuesday
evening
two
nights
ago
they
went
over
the
and
looked
at
the
pictures
which
were
really
as
good
as
the
captain
had
represented
them
the
inspection
occupied
a
little
more
than
an
hour
and
they
were
ready
to
take
their
departure
when
the
sound
of
masculine
voices
resounded
loudly
in
the
hall
and
their
conductor
announced
that
sir
david
and
his
friends
had
come
in
there
were
only
two
gentlemen
in
the
hall
when
they
went
into
that
spacious
chamber
where
there
were
great
logs
burning
on
the
wide
open
hearth
in
spite
of
the
warmth
of
the
september
day
one
of
these
two
was
sir
david
forster
a
big
man
with
a
beard
and
a
florid
complexion
the
other
was
john
saltram
who
sat
in
a
lounging
attitude
on
one
of
the
deep
examining
his
his
back
was
turned
towards
the
window
and
the
glare
of
the
blazing
logs
shone
full
upon
his
dark
face
with
a
strange
effect
one
glance
told
marian
nowell
who
this
man
was
that
powerful
face
with
its
unfathomable
eyes
and
thoughtful
mouth
was
not
the
countenance
she
had
conjured
up
from
the
depths
of
her
imagination
when
gilbert
fenton
had
described
his
friend
yet
she
felt
that
this
stranger
lounging
in
the
window
was
john
saltram
and
no
other
he
rose
and
set
down
his
gun
very
quietly
and
stood
by
the
window
waiting
while
captain
sedgewick
introduced
gilbert
to
sir
david
then
he
came
forward
shook
hands
with
his
friend
and
was
thereupon
presented
to
marian
and
her
uncle
by
gilbert
who
made
these
introductions
with
a
kind
of
happy
eagerness
sir
david
was
full
of
friendliness
and
hospitality
and
insisted
on
keeping
them
to
show
gilbert
and
miss
nowell
some
pictures
in
the
and
in
his
own
private
snuggery
apartments
which
were
not
shown
to
ordinary
visitors
they
strolled
through
these
rooms
in
a
leisurely
way
sir
david
making
considerable
pains
to
show
gilbert
fenton
the
gems
of
his
collection
john
saltram
acting
as
cicerone
to
marian
he
was
curious
to
discover
what
this
girl
was
like
whether
she
had
indeed
only
her
beauty
to
recommend
her
or
whether
she
was
in
sober
reality
the
perfect
being
gilbert
fenton
believed
her
to
be
she
was
very
beautiful
the
first
brief
look
convinced
saltram
that
upon
this
point
at
least
her
lover
had
indulged
in
no
loverlike
exaggeration
there
was
a
singular
charm
in
the
face
a
higher
more
penetrating
loveliness
than
mere
perfection
of
feature
a
kind
of
beauty
that
would
have
been
at
once
the
delight
and
desperation
of
a
painter
so
fitting
a
subject
for
his
brush
so
utterly
beyond
the
power
of
perfect
reproduction
unless
by
one
of
those
happy
almost
accidental
successes
which
make
the
triumphs
of
genius
john
saltram
watched
marian
nowell
face
thoughtfully
as
he
talked
to
her
for
the
most
part
about
the
pictures
which
they
were
looking
at
together
before
their
inspection
of
these
was
ended
he
was
fain
to
confess
to
himself
that
she
was
intelligent
as
well
as
beautiful
it
was
not
that
she
had
said
anything
particularly
brilliant
or
had
shown
herself
learned
in
the
qualities
of
the
old
dutch
masters
but
she
possessed
that
charming
childlike
capacity
for
receiving
information
from
a
superior
mind
and
that
perfect
and
rapid
power
of
appreciating
a
clever
man
conversation
which
are
apt
to
seem
so
delightful
to
the
sterner
sex
when
exhibited
by
a
pretty
woman
at
first
she
had
been
just
a
little
shy
and
constrained
in
her
talk
with
john
saltram
her
lover
account
of
this
man
had
not
inspired
her
with
any
exalted
opinion
of
his
character
she
was
rather
inclined
to
look
upon
him
as
a
person
to
be
dreaded
a
friend
whose
influence
was
dangerous
at
best
and
who
might
prove
the
evil
genius
of
gilbert
fenton
life
but
whatever
her
opinion
on
this
point
might
remain
her
reserve
soon
melted
before
john
saltram
clever
talk
and
kindly
conciliating
manner
he
laid
himself
out
to
please
on
this
occasion
and
it
was
very
rarely
he
did
that
without
succeeding
i
want
you
to
think
of
me
as
a
kind
of
brother
miss
nowell
he
said
in
the
course
of
their
talk
gilbert
and
i
have
been
something
like
brothers
for
the
last
twelve
years
of
our
lives
and
it
would
be
a
hard
thing
for
one
of
us
at
least
if
our
friendship
should
ever
be
lessened
you
shall
find
me
discretion
itself
and
you
shall
see
that
i
can
respect
gilbert
altered
position
but
i
should
like
to
lose
him
and
i
do
think
you
look
capable
of
setting
your
face
against
your
husband
old
friend
marian
blushed
a
little
at
this
remembering
that
only
an
hour
or
two
ago
she
had
been
thinking
that
this
friendship
was
a
perilous
one
for
gilbert
and
that
it
would
be
well
if
john
saltram
influence
over
him
could
be
lessened
somehow
in
the
future
i
do
believe
i
should
ever
have
the
power
to
diminish
regard
for
you
saltram
even
were
i
inclined
to
do
so
she
said
o
yes
you
would
your
power
over
him
will
be
illimitable
depend
upon
it
but
now
i
have
seen
you
i
think
you
will
only
use
it
wisely
marian
shook
her
head
laughing
gaily
i
am
much
more
fitted
to
be
ruled
than
to
rule
saltram
she
said
i
am
utterly
inexperienced
in
the
world
you
know
and
fenton
is
my
superior
in
every
way
your
superior
in
years
i
know
but
in
what
else
in
everything
else
in
intellect
and
judgment
as
well
as
in
knowledge
of
the
world
you
could
never
imagine
what
a
quiet
changeless
life
i
have
led
your
intellect
is
so
much
the
clearer
for
that
i
think
it
has
not
been
disturbed
by
all
the
narrow
petty
influences
of
a
life
spent
in
what
is
called
before
they
left
the
house
gilbert
and
the
captain
were
obliged
to
promise
to
dine
at
heatherly
next
day
very
much
to
the
secret
distaste
of
the
former
who
must
thus
lose
an
evening
with
marian
but
who
was
ashamed
to
reveal
his
hopeless
condition
by
a
persistent
refusal
captain
sedgewick
begged
john
saltram
to
choose
an
early
day
for
dining
at
the
cottage
and
gilbert
gave
him
a
general
invitation
to
lidford
house
these
matters
being
settled
they
departed
accompanied
by
saltram
who
proposed
to
walk
as
far
as
the
wood
with
them
and
who
extended
his
walk
still
farther
only
leaving
them
at
the
gate
of
the
captain
modest
domain
the
conversation
was
general
throughout
the
way
back
and
they
all
found
plenty
to
talk
about
as
they
loitered
slowly
on
among
the
waving
shadows
of
the
trees
flickering
darkly
on
the
winding
path
by
which
they
went
gilbert
lingered
outside
the
gate
after
marian
and
her
uncle
had
gone
into
the
cottage
he
was
so
eager
to
hear
his
friend
praise
the
girl
he
loved
well
john
he
asked
well
dear
old
boy
she
is
all
that
is
beautiful
and
charming
and
i
can
only
congratulate
you
upon
your
choice
miss
nowell
perfection
is
a
subject
about
which
there
can
not
be
two
opinions
and
you
think
she
loves
me
jack
do
i
think
she
loves
you
why
surely
gil
that
is
not
a
question
upon
which
you
want
another
man
judgment
no
of
course
not
but
one
is
never
tired
of
receiving
the
assurance
of
that
fact
and
you
could
see
by
her
way
of
speaking
about
me
she
spoke
of
you
in
the
prettiest
manner
possible
she
seems
to
consider
you
quite
a
superior
being
dear
girl
she
is
so
good
and
do
you
know
jack
i
feel
as
if
i
could
never
be
sufficiently
grateful
to
providence
for
my
happiness
in
having
won
such
an
angel
well
you
certainly
have
reason
to
consider
yourself
a
very
lucky
fellow
but
i
doubt
if
any
man
ever
deserved
good
fortune
better
than
you
do
gilbert
and
now
it
getting
unconscionably
late
and
i
shall
scarcely
get
back
in
time
to
change
my
clothes
for
dinner
we
spend
all
our
evenings
in
pious
devotion
to
billiards

rubber

of
a

elderly
man
who
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
service
in
india
a
harker
who
had
been
in
the
church
and
had
left
it
in
disgust
as
alike
unsuited
to

tastes
and
capacity

sentence
of
exile
after
the
dinner
at
heatherly
john
saltram
came
very
often
to
the
cottage
he
did
not
care
much
for
the
fellows
who
were
staying
with
sir
david
this
year
he
told
gilbert
he
knew
all
major
foljambe
tiger
stories
by
heart
and
had
convicted
him
of
glaring
discrepancies
in
his
description
of
the
havoc
he
and
his
brother
officers
had
made
among
the
big
game
windus
carr
was
a
conceited
presuming
cad
who
was
always
boring
them
with
impossible
accounts
of
his
conquests
among
the
fair
sex
and
that
poor
harker
was
an
unmitigated
fool
whose
brains
had
run
into
his
this
was
the
report
which
john
saltram
gave
of
his
and
he
left
the
morning
after
morning
to
go
out
boating
with
gilbert
and
marian
or
to
idle
away
the
sunny
hours
on
the
lawn
listening
to
the
talk
of
the
two
others
and
dropping
in
a
word
now
and
then
in
a
sleepy
way
as
he
lay
stretched
on
the
grass
near
them
looking
up
to
the
sky
with
his
arms
crossed
above
his
head
he
called
at
lidford
house
one
day
when
gilbert
had
told
him
he
should
stay
at
home
to
write
letters
and
was
duly
presented
to
the
listers
who
made
a
little
in
his
honour
a
few
days
afterwards
to
which
captain
sedgewick
and
marian
were
invited
a
party
which
went
off
with
more
brightness
and
gaiety
than
was
wont
to
distinguish
the
lidford
house
entertainments
after
this
there
was
more
boating
long
afternoons
spent
on
the
winding
river
with
occasional
landings
upon
picturesque
little
islands
or
wooded
banks
where
there
were
the
marian
nowell
loved
and
understood
so
well
more
idle
mornings
in
the
cottage
garden
a
happy
innocent
break
in
the
common
course
of
life
which
seemed
almost
as
pleasant
to
john
saltram
as
to
his
friend
he
had
contrived
to
make
himself
popular
with
every
one
at
lidford
and
was
an
especial
favourite
with
captain
sedgewick
he
seemed
so
thoroughly
happy
amongst
them
and
displayed
such
a
perfect
sympathy
with
them
in
all
things
that
gilbert
fenton
was
taken
utterly
by
surprise
by
his
abrupt
departure
which
happened
one
day
without
a
word
of
warning
he
had
dined
at
the
cottage
on
the
previous
evening
and
had
been
in
his
wildest
most
reckless
spirits
that
mood
to
which
he
was
subject
at
rare
intervals
and
in
which
he
exercised
a
potent
fascination
over
his
companions
he
had
beguiled
the
little
party
at
the
cottage
into
complete
forgetfulness
of
the
hour
by
his
unwonted
eloquence
upon
subjects
of
a
deeper
higher
kind
than
it
was
his
habit
to
speak
about
and
then
at
the
last
moment
when
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
had
struck
twelve
he
had
suddenly
seated
himself
at
the
piano
and
sung
them
moore
farewell
but
whenever
you
welcome
the
hour
in
tones
that
went
straight
to
the
hearts
of
the
listeners
he
had
one
of
those
rare
sympathetic
voices
which
move
people
to
tears
unawares
and
before
the
song
was
ended
marian
was
fairly
overcome
and
had
made
a
hasty
escape
from
the
room
ashamed
of
her
emotion
late
as
it
was
gilbert
accompanied
his
friend
for
a
mile
of
his
homeward
route
he
had
secured
a
during
his
last
visit
to
lidford
house
and
could
let
himself
in
quietly
of
a
night
without
entrenching
upon
the
regular
habits
of
lister
household
once
clear
of
the
cottage
john
saltram
gaiety
vanished
all
in
a
moment
and
gave
place
to
a
moody
silence
which
gilbert
was
powerless
to
dissipate
is
there
anything
amiss
jack
he
asked
i
know
high
spirits
are
not
always
a
sign
of
inward
contentment
with
you
is
there
anything
wrong
no
are
you
sure
of
that
quite
sure
i
may
be
a
little
knocked
up
perhaps
that
all
no
hint
of
his
intended
departure
fell
from
him
when
they
shook
hands
and
wished
each
other
but
early
next
morning
a
brief
note
was
delivered
to
fenton
at
his
sister
house
to
the
following
effect
my
dear
gilbert
i
find
myself
obliged
to
leave
this
place
for
london
at
once
and
have
not
time
to
thank
anyone
for
the
kindness
i
have
received
during
my
stay
will
you
do
the
best
to
repair
this
omission
on
my
part
and
offer
my
warmest
expressions
of
gratitude
to
captain
sedgewick
and
miss
nowell
for
their
goodness
to
me
pray
apologise
for
me
also
to
and
lister
for
my
inability
to
make
my
adieux
in
a
more
formal
manner
than
this
a
shortcoming
which
i
hope
to
atone
for
on
some
future
visit
tell
lister
i
shall
be
very
pleased
to
see
him
if
he
will
look
me
up
at
the
pnyx
when
he
is
next
in
town
ever
yours
john
saltram
this
was
all
there
was
no
explanation
of
the
reason
for
this
hurried
journey
a
strange
omission
between
men
who
were
on
terms
of
such
perfect
confidence
as
obtained
with
these
two
gilbert
fenton
was
not
a
little
disturbed
by
this
event
fearing
that
some
kind
of
evil
had
befallen
his
friend
his
money
matters
may
have
fallen
into
a
desperate
condition
he
thought
or
perhaps
that
woman
that
branston
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
business
he
went
to
the
cottage
that
morning
as
usual
but
not
with
his
accustomed
feeling
of
unalloyed
happiness
the
serene
heaven
of
his
tranquil
life
was
clouded
a
little
by
this
strange
conduct
of
john
saltram
it
wounded
him
to
think
that
his
old
companion
was
keeping
a
secret
from
him
i
suppose
it
is
because
i
lectured
him
a
little
about
branston
the
other
day
he
said
to
himself
the
business
is
connected
with
her
in
some
way
i
daresay
and
poor
jack
does
not
care
to
arouse
my
virtuous
indignation
that
comes
of
taking
a
high
moral
tone
with
one
friend
he
swallows
the
pill
with
a
decent
grace
at
the
time
and
shuts
one
out
of
his
confidence
ever
afterwards
captain
sedgewick
expressed
himself
much
surprised
and
disappointed
by
saltram
departure
marian
said
very
little
upon
the
subject
there
seemed
nothing
extraordinary
to
her
in
the
fact
that
a
gentleman
should
be
summoned
to
london
by
the
claims
of
business
gilbert
might
have
brooded
longer
upon
the
mystery
involved
in
his
friend
conduct
but
that
evening
post
brought
him
trouble
in
the
shape
of
bad
news
from
melbourne
his
confidential
clerk
an
old
man
who
had
been
with
his
father
for
many
years
and
who
knew
every
intricacy
of
the
business
wrote
him
a
very
long
letter
dwelling
upon
the
evil
fortune
which
attended
all
their
australian
transactions
of
late
and
hinting
at
dishonesty
and
on
the
part
of
gilbert
cousin
astley
fenton
the
local
manager
the
letter
was
a
very
sensible
one
calculated
to
arouse
a
careless
man
from
a
false
sense
of
security
gilbert
was
so
much
disturbed
by
it
that
he
determined
upon
going
back
to
london
by
the
earliest
fast
train
next
morning
it
was
cutting
short
his
holiday
only
by
a
few
days
he
had
meant
to
return
at
the
beginning
of
the
following
week
and
he
felt
that
he
had
already
some
reason
to
reproach
himself
for
his
neglect
of
business
he
left
lidford
happy
in
the
thought
that
captain
sedgewick
and
marian
were
to
come
to
london
in
october
the
period
of
separation
would
be
something
less
than
a
month
and
after
that
well
he
would
of
course
spend
christmas
at
lidford
and
he
fancied
how
the
holly
and
mistletoe
the
and
and
all
the
stereotyped
genialities
of
the
season
things
that
had
seemed
trite
and
dreary
to
him
since
the
days
of
his
boyhood
would
have
a
new
significance
and
beauty
for
him
when
he
and
marian
kept
the
sacred
festival
together
and
then
how
quickly
would
begin
the
new
year
the
year
whose
would
see
them
man
and
wife
perhaps
there
is
no
period
of
this
mortal
life
so
truly
happy
as
that
in
which
all
our
thoughts
are
occupied
in
looking
forward
to
some
great
joy
to
come
whether
the
joy
when
it
does
come
is
ever
so
unqualified
a
delight
as
it
seemed
in
the
distance
or
whether
it
ever
comes
at
all
are
questions
which
we
have
all
solved
for
ourselves
somehow
or
other
to
gilbert
fenton
these
were
bright
and
new
and
he
was
troubled
by
no
fear
of
their
not
being
realized
he
went
at
his
business
with
considerable
ardour
and
made
a
careful
and
detailed
investigation
of
all
affairs
connected
with
their
melbourne
trading
assisted
throughout
by
samuel
dwyer
the
old
clerk
the
result
of
his
examination
convinced
him
that
his
cousin
had
been
playing
him
false
that
the
men
with
whom
his
pretended
losses
had
been
made
were
men
of
straw
and
the
transactions
were
shadows
invented
to
cover
his
own
embezzlements
it
was
a
complicated
business
altogether
and
it
was
not
until
gilbert
fenton
had
been
engaged
upon
it
for
more
than
a
week
and
had
made
searching
inquiries
as
to
the
status
of
the
firms
with
which
the
supposed
dealings
had
taken
place
that
he
was
able
to
arrive
at
this
conclusion
having
at
last
made
himself
master
of
the
real
state
of
things
as
far
as
it
was
in
any
way
possible
to
do
so
at
that
distance
from
the
scene
of
action
gilbert
saw
that
there
was
only
one
line
of
conduct
open
to
him
as
a
man
of
business
that
was
to
go
at
once
to
melbourne
investigate
his
cousin
transactions
on
the
spot
and
take
the
management
of
the
colonial
house
into
his
own
hands
to
do
this
would
be
a
sore
trial
to
him
for
it
would
involve
the
postponement
of
his
marriage
he
could
scarcely
hope
to
do
what
he
had
to
do
in
melbourne
and
to
get
back
to
england
before
a
later
date
than
that
which
he
had
hoped
would
be
his
yet
to
do
anything
less
than
this
would
be
futile
and
foolish
and
it
was
possible
that
the
future
stability
of
his
position
was
dependent
upon
his
arrangement
of
these
melbourne
difficulties
it
was
his
home
the
prosperity
of
his
coming
life
that
he
had
to
fight
for
and
he
told
himself
that
he
must
put
aside
all
weakness
as
he
had
done
once
before
when
he
turned
away
from
the
studies
and
pleasures
of
young
oxford
life
to
undertake
a
fight
with
evil
fortune
he
had
conquered
then
as
he
hoped
to
conquer
now
having
an
energetic
nature
and
a
strong
faith
in
man
power
to
master
fortune
by
honest
work
and
patience
there
was
no
time
lost
after
once
his
decision
was
arrived
at
he
began
to
put
his
affairs
in
order
for
departure
immediately
and
wrote
to
marian
within
a
few
hours
of
making
up
his
mind
as
to
the
necessity
of
this
voyage
he
told
her
frankly
all
that
had
happened
that
their
fortune
was
at
stake
and
that
it
was
his
bounden
duty
to
take
this
step
hard
as
it
might
seem
to
him
he
could
not
leave
england
without
seeing
her
once
more
he
said
recently
as
they
had
parted
and
brief
as
his
leisure
must
needs
be
there
were
so
many
things
he
would
have
to
say
to
her
on
the
eve
of
this
cruel
separation
he
went
down
to
lidford
one
evening
when
all
the
arrangements
for
his
voyage
were
complete
and
he
had
two
clear
days
at
his
disposal
before
the
vessel
he
was
to
go
in
left
liverpool
the
listers
were
very
much
surprised
and
shocked
when
he
told
them
what
he
was
going
to
do
lister
bitterly
bewailing
the
insecurity
of
all
commercial
positions
and
appearing
to
consider
her
brother
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
he
found
a
warm
welcome
at
the
cottage
from
the
captain
who
heartily
approved
of
the
course
he
was
taking
and
was
full
of
hopefulness
about
the
future
a
few
months
more
or
less
can
make
little
difference
he
said
when
gilbert
was
lamenting
the
postponement
of
his
wedding
marian
will
be
quite
safe
in
her
old
uncle
care
and
i
do
not
suppose
either
of
you
will
love
each
other
any
the
less
for
the
delay
i
have
such
perfect
confidence
in
you
gilbert
you
see
and
it
is
such
a
happiness
to
me
to
know
that
my
darling
future
is
in
the
hands
of
a
man
i
can
so
thoroughly
trust
were
you
reduced
to
absolute
poverty
with
the
battle
of
life
to
fight
all
over
again
i
would
give
you
my
dear
girl
without
fear
of
the
issue
i
know
you
are
of
the
stuff
that
is
not
to
be
beaten
and
i
believe
that
neither
time
nor
circumstance
could
ever
change
your
love
for
her
you
may
believe
that
every
day
makes
her
dearer
to
me
i
should
be
ashamed
to
tell
you
how
bitterly
i
feel
this
parting
and
what
a
desperate
mental
struggle
i
went
through
before
i
could
make
up
my
mind
to
go
marian
came
into
the
room
in
the
midst
of
this
conversation
she
was
very
pale
and
her
eyes
had
a
dull
heavy
look
the
bad
news
in
letter
had
distressed
her
even
more
than
he
had
anticipated
my
darling
he
said
tenderly
looking
down
at
the
changed
face
with
her
cold
hand
clasped
in
his
own
how
ill
you
are
looking
i
fear
i
made
my
letter
too
dismal
and
that
it
frightened
you
oh
no
no
i
am
very
sorry
you
should
have
this
bad
fortune
gilbert
that
is
all
there
is
nothing
which
i
do
not
hope
to
repair
dear
the
losses
are
not
more
than
i
can
stand
all
that
i
take
to
heart
is
the
separation
from
you
marian
i
am
not
worth
so
much
regret
she
said
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
and
her
hands
clasping
and
unclasping
each
other
nervously
not
worth
so
much
regret
marian
he
exclaimed
you
are
all
the
world
to
me
the
beginning
and
end
of
my
universe
she
looked
a
little
brighter
when
her
lover
had
done
his
best
to
cheer
her
with
hopeful
talk
which
cost
him
no
small
effort
in
the
depressed
state
of
his
mind
the
day
went
by
very
slowly
although
it
was
the
last
which
those
two
were
to
spend
together
until
gilbert
return
it
was
a
hopelessly
wet
day
with
a
perpetual
drizzling
rain
and
a
sky
weather
which
seemed
to
harmonise
well
enough
with
the
pervading
gloom
of
gilbert
thoughts
as
he
stood
by
the
fire
leaning
against
an
angle
of
the
mantelpiece
and
watching
marian
needle
moving
monotonously
in
and
out
of
the
canvas
the
captain
who
led
an
easy
comfortable
kind
of
life
at
all
times
was
apt
to
dispose
of
a
good
deal
of
his
leisure
in
slumber
upon
such
a
day
as
this
he
sat
down
in
his
own
particular
dozing
behind
the
shelter
of
a
newspaper
and
lulled
agreeably
by
the
low
sound
of
gilbert
and
marian
conversation
so
the
quiet
hours
went
by
overshadowed
by
the
gloom
of
that
approaching
separation
after
dinner
when
they
had
returned
to
the
and
captain
sedgewick
had
refreshed
his
intellectual
powers
with
copious
draughts
of
strong
tea
he
began
to
talk
of
marian
childhood
and
the
circumstances
which
had
thrown
her
into
his
hand
i
do
suppose
my
little
girl
ever
showed
you
her
mother
did
she
gilbert
he
asked
never
i
thought
as
much
it
contains
that
jewelry
i
spoke
of
family
relics
which
i
have
sometimes
fancied
might
be
of
use
to
her
if
ever
her
birthright
were
worth
claiming
but
i
doubt
if
that
will
ever
happen
now
that
so
many
years
have
gone
by
and
there
has
been
no
endeavour
to
trace
her
run
and
fetch
the
case
marian
there
are
some
of
its
contents
which
gilbert
ought
to
see
before
he
leaves
england
papers
which
i
intended
to
show
him
when
i
first
told
him
your
mother
story
marian
left
them
and
came
back
in
a
few
minutes
carrying
an
ebony
inlaid
with
brass
she
unlocked
it
with
a
little
key
hanging
to
her
and
exhibited
its
contents
to
gilbert
fenton
there
were
some
curious
old
rings
of
no
great
value
a
with
a
crest
cut
on
a
bloodstone
a
crest
of
that
common
kind
of
device
which
does
not
imply
noble
or
ancient
lineage
on
the
part
of
the
bearer
thereof
a
necklace
and
earrings
of
amethyst
a
gold
bracelet
with
a
miniature
of
a
young
man
whose
handsome
face
had
a
hard
disagreeable
expression
a
locket
containing
grey
hair
and
having
a
date
and
the
initials
engraved
on
the
massive
plain
gold
case
these
were
all
the
trinkets
in
a
secret
drawer
there
was
a
certificate
of
marriage
between
percival
nowell
bachelor
gentleman
and
lucy
geoffry
spinster
at
pancras
church
london
the
most
interesting
contents
of
the
consisted
of
a
small
packet
of
letters
written
by
percival
nowell
to
lucy
geoffry
before
their
marriage
i
have
read
them
carefully
ever
so
many
times
with
the
notion
that
they
might
throw
some
light
upon
and
nowell
antecedents
said
the
captain
as
gilbert
held
these
in
his
hands
disinclined
to
look
at
documents
of
so
private
and
sacred
a
character
but
they
tell
very
little
i
fancy
that
miss
geoffry
was
a
governess
in
some
family
in
london
the
envelopes
are
missing
you
see
so
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
where
she
was
living
except
that
it
in
london
and
that
she
left
her
employment
to
marry
this
percival
nowell
you
like
to
read
the
letters
yourself
i
daresay
gilbert
put
them
in
your
pocket
and
look
them
over
at
your
leisure
when
you
get
home
you
can
bring
them
back
before
you
leave
lidford
fenton
glanced
at
marian
to
see
if
she
had
any
objection
to
his
reading
the
letters
she
was
quite
silent
looking
absently
at
the
trinkets
lying
in
the
tray
before
her
you
do
mind
my
reading
your
father
letters
marian
he
asked
not
at
all
only
i
think
you
will
find
them
very
uninteresting
i
am
interested
in
everything
that
concerns
you
he
put
the
papers
in
his
pocket
and
sat
up
for
an
hour
in
his
room
that
night
reading
percival
nowell
love
letters
they
revealed
very
little
to
him
except
the
unmitigated
selfishness
of
the
writer
that
quality
exhibited
itself
in
every
page
the
lovers
had
met
for
the
first
time
at
the
house
of
some
crosby
in
whose
family
miss
geoffry
seemed
to
be
living
and
there
were
clandestine
meetings
spoken
of
in
the
park
for
which
reason
gilbert
supposed
crosby
house
must
have
been
in
that
locality
there
were
broken
appointments
for
which
miss
geoffry
was
bitterly
reproached
by
her
lover
who
abused
the
whole
crosby
household
in
a
venomous
manner
for
having
kept
her
at
home
at
these
times
if
you
loved
me
as
you
pretend
lucy
nowell
wrote
on
one
occasion
you
would
speedily
exchange
this
degrading
slavery
for
liberty
and
happiness
with
me
and
would
be
content
to
leave
the
future
in
my
hands
without
question
or
fear
a
really
generous
woman
would
do
this
there
was
a
good
deal
more
to
the
same
effect
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
proposal
of
marriage
came
at
last
rather
reluctantly
but
it
did
come
and
was
repeated
and
urged
in
a
very
pressing
manner
while
lucy
geoffry
to
the
last
appeared
to
have
hung
back
as
if
dreading
the
result
of
that
union
the
letters
told
little
of
the
writer
circumstances
or
social
status
whenever
he
alluded
to
his
father
it
was
with
anger
and
contempt
and
in
a
manner
that
implied
some
quarrel
between
them
but
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
what
kind
of
man
the
father
was
gilbert
fenton
took
the
packet
back
to
the
cottage
next
morning
he
was
to
return
to
london
that
afternoon
and
had
only
a
few
hours
to
spend
with
marian
the
day
was
dull
and
cold
but
there
was
no
rain
and
they
walked
together
in
the
garden
where
the
leaves
were
beginning
to
fall
and
whence
every
appearance
of
summer
seemed
to
have
vanished
since
gilbert
last
visit
for
some
time
they
were
both
rather
silent
pacing
thoughtfully
up
and
down
the
sheltered
walk
that
bounded
the
lawn
gilbert
found
it
impossible
to
put
on
an
appearance
of
hopefulness
on
this
last
day
it
was
better
wholly
to
give
up
the
attempt
and
resign
himself
to
the
gloom
that
brooded
over
him
shutting
out
the
future
that
airy
castle
of
his
the
villa
on
the
banks
of
the
thames
seemed
to
have
faded
and
vanished
altogether
he
could
not
look
beyond
the
australian
journey
to
the
happy
time
of
his
return
the
hazards
of
time
and
distance
bewildered
him
he
felt
an
unspeakable
dread
of
the
distance
that
was
to
divide
him
from
marian
nowell
a
dread
that
grew
stronger
with
every
hour
he
was
destined
to
suffer
a
fresh
pang
before
the
moment
of
parting
came
marian
turned
to
him
with
an
earnest
anxious
face
and
said
gilbert
there
is
something
which
i
think
i
ought
to
say
to
you
before
you
go
away
what
is
that
my
darling
it
is
rather
hard
to
say
i
fear
it
will
give
you
pain
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
for
a
long
time
the
thought
has
been
a
constant
reproach
to
me
gilbert
it
would
be
better
if
we
were
both
free
better
if
you
could
leave
england
without
any
tie
to
weigh
you
down
with
anxieties
when
you
are
out
yonder
and
will
have
so
much
occasion
for
perfect
freedom
of
mind
marian
o
pray
pray
do
think
me
ungrateful
or
unmindful
of
your
goodness
to
me
i
am
only
anxious
for
your
happiness
i
am
not
steady
enough
or
fixed
enough
in
my
mind
i
am
not
worthy
of
all
the
thought
and
care
you
have
given
me
marian
have
i
done
anything
to
forfeit
your
love
o
no
no
then
why
do
you
say
these
things
to
me
do
you
want
to
break
my
heart
would
it
break
your
heart
if
i
were
to
recall
my
promise
gilbert
yes
marian
he
answered
gravely
drawing
her
suddenly
to
him
and
looking
into
her
face
with
earnest
scrutinising
eyes
but
if
you
do
not
love
me
if
you
can
not
love
me
and
god
knows
how
happy
i
have
been
in
the
belief
that
i
had
won
your
love
long
ago
let
the
word
be
spoken
i
will
bear
it
my
dear
i
will
bear
it
o
no
no
she
cried
shocked
by
the
dead
whiteness
of
his
face
and
bursting
into
tears
i
will
try
to
be
worthy
of
you
i
will
try
to
love
you
as
you
deserve
to
be
loved
it
was
only
a
fancy
of
mine
that
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
be
free
from
all
thoughts
of
me
i
think
it
would
seem
very
hard
to
me
to
lose
your
love
i
do
think
i
could
bear
that
gilbert
she
looked
up
at
him
with
an
appealing
expression
through
her
tears
an
innocent
look
that
went
to
his
heart
and
he
clasped
her
to
his
breast
believing
that
this
proposal
to
set
him
free
had
been
indeed
nothing
more
than
a
girlish
caprice
my
dearest
my
life
is
bound
up
with
your
love
he
said
nothing
can
part
us
except
your
ceasing
to
love
me
chapter
vii
the
hour
for
the
final
parting
came
at
last
and
gilbert
fenton
turned
his
back
upon
the
little
gate
by
which
he
had
watched
marian
nowell
standing
upon
that
first
summer
sunday
evening
which
sealed
his
destiny
he
left
lidford
weary
at
heart
weighed
down
by
a
depression
he
had
vainly
struggled
against
and
he
brooded
over
his
troubles
all
the
way
back
to
town
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
hopes
that
had
made
life
so
sweet
to
him
only
a
week
ago
had
been
swept
away
he
could
not
look
beyond
that
dreary
australian
exile
he
could
not
bring
his
thoughts
to
bear
upon
the
time
that
was
to
come
afterwards
and
which
need
be
no
less
bright
because
of
this
delay
she
may
die
while
i
am
away
he
thought
o
god
if
that
were
to
happen
if
i
were
to
come
back
and
find
her
dead
such
things
have
been
and
men
and
women
have
borne
them
and
gone
on
living
he
had
one
more
duty
to
perform
before
he
left
england
he
had
to
say
to
john
saltram
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
they
parted
that
night
at
lidford
he
could
not
leave
england
without
some
kind
of
farewell
to
his
old
friend
and
he
had
reserved
this
last
evening
for
the
duty
he
went
to
the
pnyx
on
the
chance
of
finding
saltram
there
and
failing
in
that
ate
his
solitary
dinner
in
the
the
waiters
told
him
that
saltram
had
not
been
at
the
club
for
some
weeks
gilbert
did
not
waste
much
time
over
his
dinner
and
went
straight
from
the
pnyx
to
the
temple
where
john
saltram
had
a
in
saltram
was
at
home
it
was
his
own
sonorous
voice
which
answered
gilbert
knock
bidding
him
enter
with
a
muttered
curse
upon
the
interruption
by
way
of
addendum
the
room
into
which
fenton
went
upon
receiving
this
unpromising
invitation
was
in
a
state
of
chaotic
confusion
an
open
portmanteau
sprawled
upon
the
floor
and
a
whole
wardrobe
of
masculine
garments
seemed
to
have
been
shot
at
random
on
to
the
chairs
near
it
a
dozen
bottles
full
and
empty
were
huddled
in
one
corner
a
tottered
on
the
extreme
edge
of
a
table
heaped
with
dusty
books
and
papers
and
at
a
desk
in
the
centre
of
the
room
with
a
great
paraffin
lamp
flaring
upon
his
face
as
he
wrote
sat
john
saltram
surrounded
by
fallen
slips
of
copy
writing
as
if
to
win
a
wager
who
is
it
and
what
do
you
want
he
asked
in
a
husky
voice
without
looking
up
from
his
paper
or
suspending
the
rapid
progress
of
his
pen
why
jack
i
do
think
i
ever
caught
you
so
hard
at
work
before
john
saltram
dropped
his
pen
at
the
sound
of
his
friend
voice
and
got
up
he
gave
gilbert
his
hand
in
a
mechanical
kind
of
way
no
i
do
generally
go
at
it
quite
so
hard
but
you
know
i
have
a
knack
of
doing
things
against
time
i
have
been
giving
myself
a
spell
of
hard
work
in
order
to
pick
up
a
little
cash
for
the
children
of
israel
he
dropped
back
into
his
chair
and
gilbert
took
one
opposite
him
the
lamp
shone
full
upon
john
saltram
face
as
he
sat
at
his
desk
and
after
looking
at
him
for
a
moment
by
that
vivid
light
gilbert
fenton
gave
a
cry
of
surprise
what
is
the
matter
gil
you
are
the
matter
you
are
looking
as
worn
and
haggard
as
if
you
had
a
long
illness
since
i
saw
you
last
i
never
remember
you
looking
so
ill
this
kind
of
thing
wo
do
john
you
soon
kill
yourself
at
this
rate
not
to
be
done
my
dear
fellow
i
am
the
toughest
thing
in
creation
i
have
been
sitting
up
all
night
for
the
last
week
or
so
and
that
does
rather
impair
the
freshness
of
one
complexion
but
i
assure
you
there
nothing
so
good
for
a
man
as
a
week
or
two
of
unbroken
work
i
have
been
doing
an
exhaustive
review
of
roman
literature
for
one
of
the
quarterlies
and
the
subject
involved
a
little
more
reading
than
i
was
quite
prepared
for
and
you
have
really
not
been
ill
not
in
the
least
i
am
never
he
pushed
aside
his
papers
and
sat
with
his
elbow
on
the
desk
and
his
head
leaning
on
his
hand
waiting
for
gilbert
to
talk
he
was
evidently
in
one
of
those
silent
moods
which
were
common
to
him
at
times
gilbert
told
him
of
his
melbourne
troubles
and
of
his
immediate
departure
the
announcement
roused
him
from
his
absent
humour
he
dropped
his
arm
from
the
table
suddenly
and
sat
looking
full
at
gilbert
with
a
very
intent
expression
this
is
strange
news
he
said
and
it
will
cause
the
postponement
of
your
marriage
i
suppose
unhappily
yes
that
is
unavoidable
hard
lines
is
it
jack
well
yes
i
daresay
the
separation
seems
rather
a
hardship
but
you
are
young
enough
to
stand
a
few
months
delay
when
do
you
sail
so
soon
yes
it
is
a
case
in
which
everything
depends
upon
rapidity
of
action
i
leave
liverpool
afternoon
i
came
up
from
lidford
on
purpose
to
spend
a
few
farewell
hours
with
you
and
i
have
been
thinking
jack
that
you
might
run
down
to
liverpool
with
me
and
see
the
last
of
me
eh
old
fellow
john
saltram
hesitated
looking
doubtfully
at
his
papers
it
would
be
only
a
kind
thing
to
do
jack
and
a
wholesome
change
for
yourself
into
the
bargain
anything
would
be
better
for
you
than
being
shut
up
in
these
chambers
another
day
well
gilbert
i
go
with
you
said
saltram
presently
with
a
kind
of
recklessness
it
is
a
small
thing
to
do
for
friendship
yes
i
see
you
off
dear
boy
egad
i
wish
i
could
go
to
australia
with
you
i
would
if
it
were
not
for
my
engagements
with
the
children
and
sundry
other
creditors
i
think
a
new
country
might
do
me
good
but
there
no
use
in
talking
about
that
i
bound
hand
and
foot
to
the
old
one
that
reminds
me
of
something
i
had
to
say
to
you
john
there
must
have
been
some
reason
for
your
leaving
lidford
in
that
sudden
way
the
other
day
and
your
note
explained
nothing
i
thought
you
and
i
had
no
secrets
from
each
other
it
scarcely
fair
to
treat
me
like
that
the
business
was
hardly
worth
explaining
answered
the
other
moodily
a
bill
that
i
had
forgotten
for
the
time
fell
due
just
then
and
i
hurried
off
to
set
things
straight
let
me
help
you
somehow
or
other
jack
no
gilbert
i
will
never
suffer
you
to
become
entangled
in
the
labyrinth
of
my
affairs
you
do
know
what
a
hopeless
wilderness
you
would
enter
if
you
were
desperate
enough
to
attempt
my
rescue
i
have
been
past
redemption
for
the
last
ten
years
ever
since
i
left
oxford
nothing
but
a
rich
marriage
will
ever
set
me
straight
and
i
sometimes
doubt
if
that
game
is
worth
the
candle
and
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
make
a
clean
sweep
of
my
engagements
offer
up
my
name
to
the
execration
of
mankind
and
the
fiery
indignation
of
solvent
journalists
who
would
find
subject
for
sensation
leaders
in
my
iniquities
emigrate
and
turn
bushranger
a
wild
free
life
in
the
wilderness
must
be
a
happy
exchange
for
all
the
petty
worries
and
perplexities
of
this
cursed
existence
and
how
about
branston
john
by
the
way
i
thought
that
she
might
have
had
something
to
do
with
your
sudden
journey
to
london
no
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
have
not
seen
her
since
i
came
back
from
lidford
indeed
no
your
lecture
had
a
potent
effect
you
see
said
saltram
with
something
of
a
sneer
you
have
almost
cured
me
of
that
passion
my
opinion
would
have
very
little
influence
if
you
were
far
gone
john
the
fact
is
branston
pretty
and
agreeable
as
she
may
be
is
not
the
sort
of
woman
to
acquire
any
strong
hold
upon
you
you
think
not
i
am
sure
of
it
after
this
john
saltram
became
more
expansive
they
sat
together
until
late
in
the
night
talking
chiefly
of
the
past
old
friends
and
days
recalling
the
scenes
through
which
they
had
travelled
together
with
a
pensive
tenderness
and
dwelling
regretfully
upon
that
careless
bygone
time
when
life
was
fresh
for
both
of
them
and
the
future
seemed
to
lie
across
the
straightest
easiest
to
reputation
and
happiness
gilbert
spoke
of
that
perilous
illness
of
his
in
egypt
the
fever
in
which
he
had
been
given
over
by
every
one
and
only
saved
at
last
by
the
exemplary
care
and
devotion
of
his
friend
john
saltram
had
a
profound
objection
to
this
thing
being
talked
about
and
tried
immediately
to
change
the
drift
of
the
conversation
but
gilbert
was
not
to
be
stopped
you
refuse
the
help
of
my
purse
jack
he
said
and
forget
that
i
owe
you
my
life
i
should
never
have
been
to
the
fore
to
navigate
the
good
ship
fenton
and
if
it
had
been
for
your
care
the
doctor
fellow
at
cairo
told
me
as
much
in
very
plain
terms
yes
john
i
consider
myself
your
debtor
to
the
amount
of
a
life
saving
a
man
life
is
sometimes
rather
a
doubtful
boon
i
think
if
i
had
a
fever
and
some
officious
fool
dragged
me
through
it
when
i
was
in
a
fair
way
to
make
a
decent
end
i
should
be
very
savagely
disposed
towards
him
why
john
saltram
you
are
the
last
man
in
the
world
from
whom
i
should
expect
that
dreary
kind
of
talk
yet
i
suppose
it
only
a
natural
consequence
of
shutting
yourself
up
in
these
rooms
for
ten
days
at
a
stretch
what
good
use
have
i
made
of
my
life
in
the
past
gilbert
demanded
the
other
bitterly
and
what
have
i
to
look
forward
to
in
the
future
to
marry
and
redeem
my
position
by
the
aid
of
a
woman
money
hardly
the
noblest
destiny
that
can
befall
a
man
and
yet
i
think
if
adela
branston
were
free
and
willing
to
marry
me
i
might
make
something
of
my
life
i
might
go
into
parliament
and
make
something
of
a
name
for
myself
i
could
write
books
instead
of
anonymous
articles
i
should
scarcely
sink
down
into
an
idle
mindless
existence
of
and
yes
i
think
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
to
me
would
be
to
marry
adela
branston
they
parted
at
last
john
saltram
having
faithfully
promised
his
friend
to
work
no
more
that
night
and
they
met
at
euston
square
early
the
next
morning
for
the
journey
to
liverpool
gilbert
had
never
found
his
friend
company
more
delightful
than
on
this
last
day
it
seemed
as
if
john
saltram
put
away
every
thought
of
self
in
his
perfect
sympathy
with
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
the
traveller
they
dined
together
and
it
was
dusk
when
they
wished
each
other
on
the
deck
of
the
vessel
gilbert
and
god
bless
you
if
if
anything
should
happen
to
me
if
i
should
have
gone
to
the
bad
utterly
before
you
come
back
you
must
try
to
remember
our
friendship
of
the
past
think
that
i
have
loved
you
very
dearly
as
well
as
one
man
ever
loved
another
perhaps
my
dear
john
you
have
no
need
to
tell
me
to
think
that
nothing
can
ever
weaken
the
love
between
us
and
you
are
not
likely
to
go
to
the
bad
good
bye
dear
old
friend
i
shall
remember
you
every
day
of
my
life
you
are
second
only
to
marian
in
my
heart
i
shall
write
you
an
account
of
my
proceedings
and
shall
expect
to
hear
from
you
once
more
good
bye
the
bell
rang
gilbert
fenton
and
his
friend
shook
hands
in
silence
for
the
last
time
and
in
the
next
moment
john
saltram
ran
down
the
steps
to
the
little
steamer
which
had
brought
them
out
to
the
larger
vessel
the
sails
spread
wide
in
the
cool
evening
wind
and
the
mighty
ship
glided
away
into
the
dusk
john
saltram
last
look
showed
him
his
friend
face
gazing
down
upon
him
over
the
bulwarks
full
of
trust
and
affection
he
went
back
to
london
by
the
evening
express
and
reached
his
chambers
at
a
late
hour
that
night
there
had
been
some
attempt
at
tidying
the
rooms
in
his
absence
but
his
books
and
papers
had
been
undisturbed
some
letters
were
lying
on
the
desk
amongst
them
one
in
a
big
scrawling
hand
that
was
very
familiar
to
saltram
the
envelope
stamped
lidford
he
tore
this
open
eagerly
it
was
from
sir
david
forster
dear
saltram
wrote
the
baronet
what
do
you
mean
by
this
iniquitous
conduct
you
only
obtained
my
consent
to
your
hurried
departure
the
other
day
on
condition
you
should
come
back
in
a
week
yet
there
are
no
signs
of
you
foljambe
and
the
lawyer
are
gone
and
i
am
alone
with
harker
whose
stupidity
is
something
marvellous
i
am
dying
by
inches
of
this
dismal
state
of
things
i
ca
tell
the
man
to
go
you
see
for
he
is
really
a
most
worthy
creature
although
such
a
consummate
fool
for
pity
sake
come
to
me
you
can
do
your
literary
work
down
here
as
well
as
in
london
and
i
promise
to
respect
your
laborious
ever
yours
david
forster
john
saltram
stood
with
this
letter
open
in
his
hand
staring
blankly
at
it
like
a
man
lost
in
a
dream
go
back
he
muttered
at
last
go
back
when
i
thought
i
did
such
a
great
thing
in
coming
away
no
i
am
not
weak
enough
for
that
folly
chapter
viii
missing
on
the
of
july
in
the
following
year
gilbert
fenton
landed
in
england
after
nearly
ten
months
of
exile
he
had
found
hard
work
to
do
in
the
colonial
city
and
had
done
it
surmounting
every
difficulty
by
a
steady
resolute
course
of
action
astley
fenton
had
tried
to
shelter
his
frauds
heaping
falsehood
upon
falsehood
and
had
ended
by
making
a
full
confession
after
receiving
his
cousin
promise
not
to
prosecute
the
sums
made
away
with
by
him
amounted
to
some
thousands
gilbert
found
that
he
had
been
leading
a
life
of
reckless
extravagance
and
was
a
notorious
gambler
so
there
came
an
evening
when
after
a
prolonged
investigation
of
affairs
astley
fenton
put
on
his
hat
and
left
his
cousin
office
for
ever
when
gilbert
heard
of
him
next
he
was
clerk
to
a
bookseller
in
sydney
the
disentanglement
of
the
melbourne
trading
had
occupied
longer
than
gilbert
expected
and
his
exile
had
been
especially
dreary
to
him
during
the
last
two
months
he
spent
in
australia
from
the
failure
of
his
english
letters
the
first
two
mails
after
his
arrival
had
brought
him
letters
from
marian
and
her
uncle
and
one
short
note
from
john
saltram
the
mails
that
followed
brought
him
nothing
and
he
was
inexpressibly
alarmed
and
distressed
by
this
fact
if
he
could
by
any
possibility
have
returned
to
england
immediately
after
the
arrival
of
the
first
mail
which
brought
him
no
letter
he
would
have
done
so
but
his
journey
would
have
been
wasted
had
he
not
remained
to
complete
the
work
of
reorganization
he
had
commenced
so
he
stayed
sorely
against
the
grain
hoping
to
get
a
letter
by
the
next
mail
that
came
and
with
the
same
dispiriting
result
to
gilbert
fenton
there
was
a
letter
from
his
sister
it
is
true
but
that
was
written
from
switzerland
where
she
was
travelling
with
her
husband
and
brought
him
no
tidings
of
marian
he
tried
to
convince
himself
that
if
there
had
been
bad
news
it
must
needs
have
come
to
him
that
the
delay
was
only
the
result
of
accident
some
mistake
of
marian
as
to
the
date
of
the
mail
what
more
natural
than
that
she
should
make
such
a
mistake
at
a
place
with
such
deficient
postal
arrangements
as
those
which
obtained
at
lidford
but
argue
with
himself
as
he
might
this
silence
of
his
betrothed
was
none
the
less
perplexing
to
him
and
he
was
a
prey
to
perpetual
anxiety
during
the
time
that
elapsed
before
the
sailing
of
the
vessel
that
was
to
convey
him
back
to
england
then
came
the
long
monotonous
voyage
affording
ample
leisure
for
gloomy
thoughts
for
shapeless
fears
in
the
dead
watches
of
the
night
when
the
sea
washed
drearily
against
his
cabin
window
and
he
lay
broad
awake
counting
the
hours
that
must
wear
themselves
out
before
he
could
set
foot
on
english
ground
as
the
time
of
his
arrival
drew
nearer
his
mind
grew
restless
and
fitful
now
full
of
hope
and
happy
visions
of
his
meeting
with
marian
now
weighed
down
by
the
burden
of
some
unspeakable
terror
the
day
dawned
at
last
that
sultry
summer
day
and
gilbert
was
amongst
those
eager
passengers
who
quitted
the
vessel
at
daybreak
he
went
straight
from
the
quay
to
the
and
the
delay
of
an
hour
which
he
had
to
endure
here
seemed
almost
interminable
to
him
as
he
paced
to
and
fro
the
long
platform
waiting
for
the
london
express
he
wondered
how
he
had
borne
all
the
previous
delay
how
he
had
been
able
to
live
through
that
dismal
agonizing
time
his
own
patience
was
a
mystery
to
him
now
that
the
ordeal
was
over
the
express
started
at
last
and
he
sat
quietly
in
his
corner
trying
to
read
a
newspaper
while
his
discussed
the
state
of
trade
in
liverpool
which
seemed
from
their
account
to
be
as
desperate
and
hopeless
as
the
condition
of
all
commerce
appears
invariably
to
be
whenever
commercial
matters
come
under
discussion
gilbert
fenton
was
not
interested
in
the
liverpool
trade
at
this
particular
crisis
he
knew
that
he
had
weathered
the
storm
which
had
assailed
his
own
fortunes
and
that
the
future
lay
clear
and
bright
before
him
he
did
not
waste
an
hour
in
london
but
went
straight
from
one
station
to
another
and
was
in
time
to
catch
a
train
for
fairleigh
the
station
nearest
to
lidford
it
was
five
in
the
afternoon
when
he
arrived
at
this
place
and
chartered
a
fly
to
take
him
over
to
lidford
a
lovely
summer
afternoon
the
sight
of
the
familiar
english
scenery
looking
so
exquisite
in
its
summer
glory
filled
him
with
a
pleasure
that
was
almost
akin
to
pain
he
had
often
walked
this
road
with
marian
and
as
he
drove
along
he
looked
eagerly
at
every
distant
figure
half
hoping
to
see
his
darling
approach
him
in
the
summer
sunlight
fenton
deposited
his
at
the
cosy
village
inn
where
curtains
fluttered
gaily
at
every
window
in
the
warm
western
breeze
and
innumerable
geraniums
made
a
gaudy
blaze
of
scarlet
against
the
wooden
wall
he
did
not
stop
here
to
make
any
inquiries
about
those
he
had
come
to
see
his
heart
was
beating
tumultuously
in
expectation
of
the
meeting
that
seemed
so
near
he
alighted
from
the
fly
dismissed
the
driver
and
walked
rapidly
across
a
field
leading
by
a
short
cut
to
the
green
on
which
captain
sedgewick
house
stood
this
field
brought
him
to
the
side
of
the
green
opposite
the
captain
cottage
he
stopped
for
a
moment
as
he
came
through
the
little
wooden
gate
and
looked
across
the
grass
where
a
regiment
of
geese
was
marching
towards
the
still
pool
of
water
the
shutters
of
the
upper
rooms
were
closed
and
there
was
a
board
above
the
the
cottage
was
to
be
let
gilbert
fenton
heart
gave
one
great
throb
and
then
seemed
to
cease
beating
altogether
he
walked
across
the
green
slowly
stunned
by
this
blow
yes
the
house
was
empty
the
garden
which
he
remembered
in
such
exquisite
order
had
a
weedy
dilapidated
look
that
seemed
like
the
decay
of
some
considerable
time
he
rang
the
bell
several
times
but
there
was
no
answer
and
he
was
turning
away
from
the
gate
with
the
stunned
confused
feeling
still
upon
him
unable
to
consider
what
he
ought
to
do
next
when
he
heard
himself
called
by
his
name
and
saw
a
woman
looking
at
him
across
the
hedge
of
the
neighbouring
garden
were
you
wishing
to
make
any
inquiries
about
the
last
occupants
of
hazel
cottage
sir
she
asked
yes
gilbert
answered
huskily
looking
at
her
in
an
absent
unseeing
way
he
had
seen
her
often
during
his
visits
to
the
cottage
busy
at
work
in
her
garden
which
was
much
smaller
than
the
captain
but
he
had
never
spoken
to
her
before
she
was
a
maiden
lady
who
eked
out
her
slender
income
by
letting
a
part
of
her
miniature
abode
whenever
an
opportunity
for
so
doing
occurred
the
care
of
this
cottage
occupied
all
her
days
and
formed
the
delight
and
glory
of
her
life
it
was
a
little
larger
than
a
doll
house
and
furnished
with
chairs
and
tables
that
had
been
polished
to
the
last
extremity
of
brightness
perhaps
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
walk
into
my
for
a
few
moments
sir
said
this
lady
opening
her
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
afford
you
any
information
about
your
friends
you
are
very
good
said
gilbert
following
her
into
the
prim
little
parlour
he
had
recovered
his
in
some
degree
by
this
time
telling
himself
that
this
desertion
of
hazel
cottage
involved
no
more
than
a
change
of
residence
my
name
is
dodd
said
the
lady
motioning
fenton
to
a
chair
miss
letitia
dodd
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
very
often
during
your
visits
next
door
i
was
not
on
visiting
terms
with
captain
sedgewick
and
miss
nowell
although
we
bowed
to
each
other
out
of
doors
i
am
only
a
tradesman
daughter
indeed
my
brother
is
now
carrying
on
business
as
a
butcher
in
fairleigh
and
of
course
i
am
quite
aware
of
the
difference
in
our
positions
i
am
the
last
person
to
intrude
myself
upon
my
superiors
if
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
where
they
have
gone
gilbert
asked
eager
to
stop
this
formal
statement
of
miss
dodd
social
standing
where
have
gone
she
repeated
dear
dear
then
you
do
not
know
i
do
not
know
what
of
captain
sedgewick
death
good
god
my
dear
old
friend
when
did
he
die
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
it
was
very
sudden
a
fit
of
apoplexy
he
was
seized
in
the
night
poor
dear
gentleman
and
it
was
only
discovered
when
the
servant
went
to
call
him
in
the
morning
he
only
lived
two
days
after
the
seizure
and
never
spoke
again
and
miss
nowell
what
made
her
leave
the
cottage
she
is
still
at
lidford
i
suppose
o
dear
no
fenton
she
went
away
altogether
about
a
month
after
the
captain
death
where
did
she
go
i
can
not
tell
you
that
i
did
not
even
know
that
she
intended
leaving
hazel
cottage
until
the
day
after
she
left
when
i
saw
the
shutters
closed
and
the
board
up
you
might
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
miss
nowell
was
so
much
liked
in
lidford
and
she
had
more
than
one
invitation
from
friends
to
stay
with
them
for
the
sake
of
a
change
after
her
uncle
death
but
she
would
not
visit
anywhere
she
stayed
quite
alone
in
the
cottage
with
only
the
old
servant
but
there
must
surely
be
some
one
in
the
place
who
knows
where
she
has
gone
exclaimed
gilbert
i
think
not
the
landlord
of
hazel
cottage
does
not
know
he
is
my
landlord
also
and
i
was
asking
him
about
miss
nowell
when
i
paid
my
rent
the
other
day
he
said
he
supposed
she
had
gone
away
to
be
married
that
has
been
the
general
impression
in
fact
at
lidford
people
made
sure
that
miss
nowell
had
left
to
be
married
to
you
i
have
only
just
returned
from
australia
i
have
come
back
to
fulfil
my
engagement
to
miss
nowell
can
you
suggest
no
one
from
whom
i
am
likely
to
obtain
information
there
is
the
family
at
the
rectory
they
knew
her
very
well
and
were
extremely
kind
to
her
after
her
uncle
death
it
might
be
worth
your
while
to
call
upon
mr
marchant
yes
i
will
call
gilbert
answered
thanks
for
the
suggestion
he
wished
miss
dodd
and
left
her
standing
at
the
gate
of
her
little
garden
watching
him
with
profound
interest
as
he
walked
away
towards
the
village
there
was
a
pleasing
mystery
in
the
affair
to
the
mind
of
miss
dodd
gilbert
fenton
went
at
once
to
the
rectory
although
it
was
now
past
seven
he
had
met
and
marchant
several
times
and
had
visited
them
with
the
listers
the
rector
was
at
home
sitting
over
his
solitary
glass
of
port
by
the
open
window
of
his
snug
looking
lazily
out
at
a
group
of
sons
and
daughters
playing
croquet
on
the
lawn
he
was
surprised
to
see
fenton
but
welcomed
him
with
much
cordiality
i
have
come
to
you
full
of
care
marchant
gilbert
began
and
the
pressing
nature
of
my
business
must
excuse
the
lateness
of
my
visit
there
is
no
occasion
for
any
excuse
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
at
this
time
pray
help
yourself
to
some
wine
there
are
clean
glasses
near
you
and
take
some
of
those
strawberries
on
which
my
wife
prides
herself
amazingly
people
who
live
in
the
country
all
their
days
are
obliged
to
give
their
minds
to
horticulture
and
now
what
is
this
care
of
yours
fenton
nothing
very
serious
i
hope
it
is
very
serious
to
me
at
present
i
think
you
know
that
i
am
engaged
to
miss
nowell
perfectly
i
had
imagined
until
this
moment
that
you
and
she
were
married
when
she
left
lidford
i
concluded
that
she
had
gone
to
stay
with
friends
of
yours
and
that
the
marriage
would
in
all
probability
take
place
at
an
early
period
without
any
strict
observance
of
etiquette
as
to
her
mourning
for
her
uncle
it
was
natural
that
we
should
think
this
knowing
her
solitary
position
then
you
do
not
know
where
she
went
on
leaving
this
place
not
in
the
faintest
degree
her
departure
was
altogether
unexpected
by
us
my
wife
and
daughters
called
upon
her
two
or
three
times
after
the
captain
death
and
were
even
anxious
that
she
should
come
here
to
stay
for
a
short
time
but
she
would
not
do
that
she
seemed
grateful
and
touched
by
their
anxiety
about
her
but
they
could
not
bring
her
to
talk
of
her
future
and
she
told
them
nothing
of
her
intention
to
leave
lidford
not
a
word
this
was
all
that
gilbert
fenton
could
learn
his
interview
with
the
rector
lasted
some
time
longer
but
it
told
him
nothing
whom
next
could
he
question
he
knew
all
marian
friends
and
he
spent
the
next
day
in
calling
upon
them
but
with
the
same
result
no
one
could
tell
him
her
reason
for
leaving
hazel
cottage
or
where
she
had
gone
there
remained
only
one
person
whom
he
could
question
and
that
was
the
old
servant
who
had
lived
with
captain
sedgewick
nearly
all
the
time
of
his
residence
at
lidford
and
whom
gilbert
had
conciliated
by
numerous
gifts
during
his
visits
to
hazel
cottage
she
was
a
honest
creature
of
about
fifty
and
had
been
devoted
to
the
captain
and
marian
after
a
good
deal
of
trouble
gilbert
ascertained
that
this
woman
had
not
accompanied
her
young
mistress
when
she
left
lidford
but
had
taken
service
in
a
grocer
family
at
fairleigh
having
discovered
this
fenton
set
off
immediately
for
the
little
on
foot
this
time
and
with
his
mind
full
of
the
days
when
he
and
marian
had
walked
this
way
together
he
found
the
shop
to
which
he
had
been
directed
a
roomy
emporium
in
the
sunk
three
or
four
feet
below
the
level
of
the
pavement
and
approached
by
a
couple
of
steps
a
shop
with
a
low
ceiling
that
was
made
lower
by
bunches
of
candles
hams
bacon
and
other
merchandise
hanging
from
the
massive
beams
that
spanned
it
fenton
having
duly
stated
his
business
was
shown
into
the
grocer
best
parlour
a
resplendent
apartment
where
there
were
more
ornaments
in
the
way
of
flowers
under
glass
shades
and
bohemian
glass
than
were
consistent
with
luxurious
occupation
and
where
every
chair
and
sofa
was
made
a
perfect
veiled
prophet
by
enshrouding
antimacassors
here
sarah
down
the
late
captain
servant
came
to
fenton
wiping
her
hands
and
arms
upon
a
spotless
canvas
apron
and
generally
apologetic
as
to
her
appearance
to
this
woman
gilbert
repeated
the
question
he
had
asked
of
others
with
the
same
disheartening
result
the
poor
dear
young
lady
felt
the
captain
loss
dreadfully
as
well
she
might
when
they
had
been
so
fond
of
each
other
sarah
down
said
in
answer
to
one
of
gilbert
inquiries
i
never
knew
any
one
grieve
so
deeply
she
would
go
anywhere
and
she
could
bear
to
see
any
one
who
came
to
see
her
she
used
to
shut
herself
up
in
the
captain
room
day
after
day
kneeling
by
his
bedside
and
crying
as
if
her
heart
would
break
i
have
looked
through
the
keyhole
sometimes
and
seen
her
there
on
her
knees
with
her
face
buried
in
the
bedclothes
she
did
care
to
talk
about
him
even
to
me
and
i
had
hard
work
to
persuade
her
to
eat
or
drink
enough
to
keep
life
in
her
at
this
time
when
the
days
were
fine
i
used
to
try
and
get
her
to
walk
out
a
little
for
she
looked
as
white
as
a
ghost
for
want
of
air
and
after
a
good
deal
of
persuasion
she
did
go
out
sometimes
of
an
afternoon
but
she
would
ask
any
one
to
walk
with
her
though
there
were
plenty
she
might
have
asked
the
young
ladies
from
the
rectory
and
others
she
preferred
being
alone
she
told
me
and
i
was
glad
that
she
should
get
the
air
and
the
change
anyhow
she
brightened
a
little
after
this
but
very
little
it
was
all
of
a
sudden
one
day
that
she
told
me
she
was
going
away
i
wanted
to
go
with
her
but
she
said
that
could
be
i
asked
her
where
she
was
going
and
she
told
me
after
hesitating
a
little
that
she
was
going
to
friends
in
london
i
knew
she
had
been
very
fond
of
two
young
ladies
that
she
went
to
school
with
at
lidford
whose
father
lived
in
london
and
i
thought
it
was
to
their
house
she
was
going
i
asked
her
if
it
was
and
she
said
yes
she
made
arrangements
with
the
landlord
about
selling
the
furniture
he
is
an
auctioneer
himself
and
there
was
no
difficulty
about
that
the
money
was
to
be
sent
to
her
at
a
in
london
i
wondered
at
that
but
she
said
it
was
better
so
she
paid
every
sixpence
that
was
owing
and
gave
me
a
handsome
present
over
and
above
my
wages
though
i
did
want
to
take
anything
from
her
poor
dear
young
lady
knowing
that
there
was
very
little
left
after
the
captain
death
except
the
furniture
which
likely
to
bring
much
and
so
she
went
away
about
two
days
after
she
first
mentioned
that
she
was
going
to
leave
lidford
it
was
all
very
sudden
and
i
do
think
she
bade
to
any
one
in
the
place
she
seemed
quite
broken
down
with
grief
in
those
two
last
days
i
shall
never
forget
her
poor
pale
face
when
she
got
into
the
fly
how
did
she
go
from
the
station
here
i
do
know
anything
about
that
except
that
the
fly
came
to
the
cottage
for
her
and
her
luggage
i
wanted
to
go
to
the
station
with
her
to
see
her
off
but
she
would
let
me
did
she
mention
me
during
the
time
that
followed
captain
death
only
when
i
spoke
about
you
sir
i
used
to
try
to
comfort
her
telling
her
she
had
you
still
left
to
care
for
her
and
to
make
up
for
him
lost
but
she
used
to
look
at
me
in
a
strange
pitiful
sort
of
way
and
shake
her
head
am
very
miserable
sarah
she
would
say
to
me
am
quite
alone
in
the
world
now
my
dear
uncle
is
gone
and
i
do
know
what
to
do
i
told
her
she
ought
to
look
forward
to
the
time
when
she
would
be
married
and
would
have
a
happy
home
of
her
own
but
i
could
never
get
her
to
talk
of
that
can
you
tell
me
the
name
and
address
of
her
friends
in
london
the
young
ladies
with
whom
she
went
to
school
the
name
is
bruce
sir
and
they
live
or
they
used
to
live
at
that
time
in
i
have
heard
miss
nowell
say
that
but
i
know
the
name
of
the
street
or
number
of
the
house
i
daresay
i
shall
be
able
to
find
them
it
is
a
strange
business
sarah
it
is
most
unaccountable
that
my
dearest
girl
should
have
left
lidford
without
writing
me
word
of
her
removal
and
her
intentions
with
regard
to
the
future
that
she
should
have
sent
me
no
announcement
of
her
death
although
she
must
have
known
how
well
i
loved
him
i
am
going
to
ask
you
a
question
that
is
very
painful
to
me
but
which
must
be
asked
sooner
or
later
do
you
know
of
any
one
else
whom
she
may
have
liked
better
than
me
any
one
whose
influence
may
have
governed
her
at
the
time
she
left
lidford
no
indeed
sir
replied
the
woman
promptly
who
else
was
there
miss
nowell
knew
so
few
gentlemen
and
saw
no
one
except
the
rector
family
and
two
or
three
ladies
after
the
uncle
death
not
at
the
cottage
perhaps
but
she
may
have
seen
some
one
you
say
she
always
went
out
alone
at
that
time
and
preferred
to
do
so
yes
sir
that
is
true
but
it
seemed
natural
enough
that
she
should
like
to
be
alone
on
account
of
her
grief
there
must
have
been
some
reason
for
her
silence
towards
me
sarah
she
could
not
have
acted
so
cruelly
without
some
powerful
motive
heaven
only
knows
what
it
may
have
been
the
business
of
my
life
will
be
to
find
her
to
see
her
face
to
face
once
more
and
hear
the
explanation
of
her
conduct
from
her
own
lips
he
thanked
the
woman
for
her
information
slipped
a
sovereign
into
her
hand
and
departed
he
called
upon
the
proprietor
of
hazel
cottage
an
auctioneer
surveyor
and
in
the
of
fairleigh
but
could
obtain
no
fresh
tidings
from
this
gentleman
except
the
fact
that
the
money
realised
by
the
captain
furniture
had
been
sent
to
miss
nowell
at
a
in
the
city
and
had
been
duly
acknowledged
by
her
after
a
delay
of
about
a
week
the
auctioneer
showed
gilbert
the
letter
of
receipt
which
was
worded
in
a
very
formal
manner
and
bore
no
address
but
london
the
sight
of
the
familiar
hand
gave
him
a
sharp
pang
o
god
how
he
had
languished
for
a
letter
in
that
handwriting
he
had
nothing
more
to
do
after
this
in
the
neighbourhood
of
lidford
except
to
pay
a
pious
visit
to
the
captain
grave
where
a
handsome
slab
of
granite
recorded
the
virtues
of
the
dead
it
lay
in
the
prettiest
most
retired
part
of
the
churchyard
under
a
yew
gilbert
fenton
sat
down
upon
a
low
wall
near
at
hand
for
a
long
time
brooding
over
his
broken
life
and
wishing
himself
at
rest
beneath
that
solemn
shelter
she
never
loved
me
he
said
to
himself
bitterly
i
shut
my
eyes
obstinately
to
the
truth
or
i
might
have
discovered
the
secret
of
her
indifference
by
a
hundred
signs
and
tokens
i
fancied
that
a
man
who
loved
a
woman
as
i
loved
her
must
succeed
in
winning
her
heart
at
last
and
i
accepted
her
girlish
trust
in
me
her
innocent
gratitude
for
my
attentions
as
the
evidence
of
her
love
even
at
the
last
when
she
wanted
to
release
me
i
would
not
understand
i
did
not
expect
to
be
loved
as
i
loved
her
i
would
have
given
so
much
and
been
content
to
take
so
little
what
is
there
i
would
not
have
done
what
sacrifice
of
my
own
pride
that
i
would
not
have
happily
made
to
win
her
o
my
darling
even
in
your
desertion
of
me
you
might
have
trusted
me
better
than
this
you
would
have
found
me
fond
and
faithful
through
every
trial
your
friend
in
spite
of
every
wrong
he
knelt
down
by
the
grave
and
pressed
his
lips
to
the
granite
on
which
george
sedgewick
name
was
chiselled
i
owe
it
to
the
dead
to
discover
her
fate
he
said
to
himself
as
he
rose
from
that
reverent
attitude
i
owe
it
to
the
dead
to
penetrate
the
secret
of
her
new
life
to
assure
myself
that
she
is
happy
and
has
fallen
under
no
fatal
influence
the
listers
were
still
abroad
and
gilbert
was
very
glad
that
it
was
so
it
would
have
excruciated
him
to
hear
his
sister
comments
on
conduct
and
to
perceive
the
suppressed
exultation
with
which
she
would
most
likely
have
discussed
this
unhappy
termination
to
an
engagement
which
had
been
entered
on
in
utter
disregard
of
her
counsel
chapter
ix
john
saltram
advice
fenton
discovered
the
bruce
family
in
after
a
good
deal
of
trouble
but
they
could
tell
him
nothing
of
their
dear
friend
miss
nowell
of
whom
they
spoke
with
the
warmest
regard
they
had
never
seen
her
since
they
had
left
the
school
at
lidford
where
they
had
been
boarders
and
she
a
daily
pupil
they
had
not
even
heard
of
captain
sedgewick
death
gilbert
asked
these
young
ladies
if
they
knew
of
any
other
acquaintance
of
marian
living
in
or
near
london
they
both
answered
promptly
in
the
negative
the
school
was
a
small
one
and
they
had
been
the
only
pupils
who
came
from
town
nor
had
they
ever
heard
marian
speak
of
any
london
friends
thus
ended
fenton
inquiries
in
this
direction
leaving
him
no
wiser
than
when
he
left
lidford
he
had
now
exhausted
every
possible
channel
by
which
he
might
obtain
information
the
ground
lay
open
before
him
and
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
but
publicity
he
took
an
advertisement
to
the
office
that
afternoon
and
paid
for
six
insertions
in
the
second
column
miss
marian
nowell
late
of
lidford
midlandshire
is
requested
to
communicate
immediately
with
to
whom
her
silence
has
caused
extreme
anxiety
she
may
rely
upon
the
advertiser
friendship
and
fidelity
under
all
possible
circumstances
gilbert
felt
a
little
more
hopeful
after
having
done
this
he
fancied
this
advertisement
must
needs
bring
him
some
tidings
of
his
lost
love
the
mystery
might
be
happily
solved
after
all
and
marian
prove
true
to
him
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
this
was
possible
but
it
was
very
difficult
to
reconcile
her
line
of
conduct
with
the
fact
of
her
regard
for
him
in
the
evening
he
went
to
the
temple
eager
to
see
john
saltram
from
whom
he
had
no
intention
to
keep
the
secret
of
his
trouble
he
found
his
friend
at
home
writing
with
his
desk
pushed
against
the
open
window
and
the
dust
and
shabbiness
of
his
room
dismally
obvious
in
the
hot
july
sunshine
he
started
up
as
gilbert
entered
and
the
dark
face
grew
suddenly
pale
you
took
me
by
surprise
he
said
i
did
know
you
were
in
england
i
only
landed
two
days
ago
answered
gilbert
as
they
shook
hands
i
daresay
i
startled
you
a
little
dear
old
fellow
coming
in
upon
you
without
a
moment
notice
when
you
fancied
i
was
at
the
antipodes
but
you
see
i
hunted
you
up
directly
i
was
free
you
have
done
well
out
yonder
i
hope
gilbert
yes
everything
has
gone
well
enough
with
me
in
business
but
my
coming
home
has
been
a
dreary
one
how
is
that
captain
sedgewick
is
dead
and
marian
nowell
is
lost
lost
what
do
you
mean
by
that
fenton
told
his
friend
all
that
had
befallen
him
since
his
arrival
in
england
i
come
to
you
for
counsel
and
help
john
he
said
when
he
had
finished
his
story
i
will
give
you
my
help
so
far
as
it
is
possible
for
one
man
to
help
another
in
such
a
business
and
my
counsel
in
all
honesty
answered
john
saltram
but
i
doubt
if
you
will
be
inclined
to
receive
it
why
should
you
doubt
that
because
it
is
not
likely
to
agree
with
your
own
ideas
speak
out
john
i
think
that
if
miss
nowell
had
really
loved
you
she
would
never
have
taken
this
step
i
think
that
she
must
have
left
lidford
in
order
to
escape
from
her
engagement
perhaps
expecting
your
early
return
i
believe
your
pursuit
of
her
can
only
end
in
failure
and
disappointment
and
although
i
am
ready
to
assist
you
in
any
manner
you
wish
i
warn
you
against
sacrificing
your
life
to
a
delusion
it
is
not
under
the
delusion
that
marian
nowell
loves
me
that
i
am
going
to
search
for
her
gilbert
fenton
said
slowly
after
an
interval
of
silence
i
am
not
so
weak
as
to
believe
after
what
has
happened
though
i
have
tried
to
argue
with
myself
only
this
afternoon
that
she
may
still
be
true
to
me
and
that
there
may
have
been
some
hidden
reason
for
her
conduct
granted
that
she
wished
to
escape
from
her
engagement
she
might
have
trusted
to
my
honour
to
give
her
a
prompt
release
the
moment
i
became
acquainted
with
the
real
state
of
her
feelings
there
must
have
been
some
stronger
influence
than
this
at
work
when
she
left
lidford
i
want
to
know
the
true
cause
of
that
hurried
departure
john
i
want
to
be
sure
that
marian
nowell
is
happy
and
in
safe
hands
by
what
means
do
you
hope
to
discover
this
i
rely
a
good
deal
upon
repeated
advertisements
in
the
they
may
bring
me
tidings
of
marian
if
not
directly
from
some
person
who
has
seen
her
since
she
left
lidford
if
she
really
wished
to
hide
herself
from
you
she
would
most
likely
change
her
name
why
should
she
wish
to
hide
herself
from
me
she
must
know
that
she
might
trust
me
of
her
own
free
will
she
would
never
do
this
cruel
thing
there
must
have
been
some
secret
influence
at
work
upon
my
mind
it
shall
be
my
business
to
discover
what
that
influence
was
or
in
plainer
words
still
to
discover
the
man
who
has
robbed
me
of
marian
nowell
heart
it
comes
to
that
then
said
john
saltram
you
suspect
some
unknown
rival
yes
that
is
the
most
natural
conclusion
to
arrive
at
and
yet
heaven
knows
how
unwillingly
i
take
that
into
consideration
there
is
no
particular
person
whom
you
suspect
no
one
if
there
should
be
no
result
from
your
advertisement
what
will
you
do
i
can
not
tell
you
just
yet
unless
i
get
some
kind
of
clue
the
business
will
seem
a
hopeless
one
but
i
can
not
imagine
that
the
advertisements
will
fail
completely
if
she
left
lidford
to
be
married
there
must
be
some
record
of
her
marriage
should
my
first
advertisements
fail
my
next
shall
be
inserted
with
a
view
to
discover
such
a
record
and
if
after
infinite
trouble
you
should
find
her
the
wife
of
another
man
what
reward
would
you
have
for
your
wasted
time
and
lost
labour
the
happiness
of
knowing
her
to
be
in
a
safe
and
honourable
position
i
love
her
too
dearly
to
remain
in
ignorance
of
her
fate
well
gilbert
i
know
that
good
advice
is
generally
thrown
away
in
such
a
case
as
this
but
i
have
a
fixed
opinion
on
the
subject
to
my
mind
there
is
only
one
wise
course
open
to
you
and
that
is
to
let
this
thing
alone
and
resign
yourself
to
the
inevitable
i
acknowledge
that
miss
nowell
was
eminently
worthy
of
your
affection
but
you
know
the
old
song
she
be
not
fair
to
me
what
care
i
how
fair
she
be
there
are
plenty
of
women
in
the
world
the
choice
is
wide
enough
not
for
me
john
marian
nowell
is
the
only
woman
i
have
ever
loved
the
only
woman
i
ever
can
love
my
dear
boy
it
is
so
natural
for
you
to
believe
that
just
now
and
a
year
hence
you
will
think
so
differently
no
john
but
i
am
not
going
to
make
any
protestations
of
my
constancy
let
the
matter
rest
i
knew
that
my
life
is
broken
that
this
blow
has
left
me
nothing
to
hope
for
or
to
live
for
except
the
hope
of
finding
the
girl
who
has
wronged
me
i
wo
weary
you
with
lamentations
my
talk
has
been
entirely
of
self
since
i
came
into
this
room
tell
me
your
own
affairs
jack
old
friend
how
has
the
world
gone
with
you
since
we
parted
at
liverpool
last
year
not
too
smoothly
my
financial
position
becomes
a
little
more
obscure
and
difficult
of
comprehension
every
year
as
you
know
but
i
rub
on
somehow
i
have
been
working
at
literature
like
a
have
contributed
no
end
of
stuff
to
the
quarterlies
and
am
engaged
upon
a
book
yes
gil
positively
a
book
which
i
hope
may
do
great
things
for
me
if
ever
i
can
finish
it
is
it
a
novel
a
novel
no
cried
john
saltram
with
a
wry
face
it
is
the
romance
of
reality
i
deal
with
my
book
is
a
life
of
jonathan
swift
he
was
always
a
favourite
study
of
mine
you
know
that
brilliant
unprincipled
intolerant
cynical
irresistible
miserable
man
scott
biography
seems
to
me
to
give
but
a
tame
picture
and
others
are
only
sketches
mine
will
be
a
study
faithful
as
a
photograph
careful
as
a
miniature
on
ivory
and
i
trust
it
will
bring
you
fame
and
money
when
the
time
comes
answered
gilbert
and
how
about
branston
is
she
as
charming
as
ever
a
little
more
so
if
possible
poor
old
michael
branston
is
dead
went
off
the
hooks
rather
suddenly
about
a
month
ago
the
widow
looks
amazingly
pretty
in
her
weeds
and
you
will
marry
her
i
suppose
jack
as
soon
as
her
mourning
is
over
well
yes
it
is
on
the
cards
john
saltram
said
in
an
indifferent
tone
why
how
you
say
that
is
there
any
doubt
as
to
the
lady
fortune
o
no
that
is
all
square
enough
michael
branston
will
was
in
the
london
the
personalty
sworn
under
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
all
left
to
the
widow
besides
real
property
a
house
in
cavendish
square
the
villa
at
maidenhead
and
a
place
near
leamington
it
would
be
a
splendid
match
for
you
jack
splendid
of
course
an
unprecedented
stroke
of
luck
for
such
a
fellow
as
i
yet
i
doubt
very
much
if
i
am
quite
the
man
for
that
sort
of
life
i
should
be
apt
to
fancy
it
a
kind
of
gilded
slavery
i
think
gil
and
there
would
be
some
danger
of
my
kicking
off
the
chains
but
you
like
branston
do
you
jack
like
her
yes
i
like
her
too
well
to
deceive
her
and
she
would
expect
devoted
affection
from
a
second
husband
she
is
full
of
romantic
ideas
theories
of
life
which
she
was
obliged
to
nip
in
the
bud
when
she
went
to
the
altar
with
old
branston
but
which
have
burst
into
flower
now
that
she
is
free
have
you
seen
her
often
since
her
husband
death
only
twice
once
immediately
after
the
funeral
and
again
yesterday
she
is
living
in
cavendish
square
just
now
i
hope
you
will
marry
her
i
should
like
to
see
you
safe
in
smooth
water
and
with
some
purpose
in
life
i
should
like
to
see
you
turn
your
back
upon
the
loneliness
of
these
dreary
chambers
they
are
not
very
brilliant
are
they
i
do
know
how
many
generations
of
briefless
barristers
these
chairs
and
tables
have
served
the
rooms
have
an
atmosphere
of
failure
but
they
suit
me
very
well
i
am
not
always
here
you
know
i
spend
a
good
deal
of
my
time
in
the
country
whereabouts
sometimes
in
one
direction
sometimes
in
another
wherever
my
truant
fancy
leads
me
i
prefer
such
spots
as
are
most
remote
from
the
haunts
of
men
unknown
to
cockneys
and
so
long
as
there
is
a
river
within
reach
of
my
lodging
i
can
make
myself
tolerably
happy
with
a
punt
and
a
and
contrive
to
forget
my
cares
you
have
not
been
to
lidford
since
i
left
england
i
suppose
yes
i
was
at
heatherly
a
week
or
two
in
the
winter
poor
old
david
forster
would
not
let
me
alone
until
i
went
down
to
him
he
was
ill
and
in
a
very
dismal
condition
altogether
abandoned
by
the
rest
of
his
cronies
and
a
close
prisoner
in
the
house
which
has
so
many
painful
associations
for
him
it
was
a
work
of
charity
to
bear
him
company
did
you
see
captain
sedgewick
or
marian
while
you
were
down
there
no
i
should
have
liked
to
have
called
upon
the
kind
old
captain
but
forster
was
unconscionably
exacting
there
was
no
getting
away
from
him
gilbert
stopped
with
his
friend
until
late
that
night
smoking
and
drinking
a
mild
mixture
of
brandy
and
and
talking
of
the
things
that
had
been
doing
on
this
side
of
the
globe
while
he
had
been
on
the
other
no
more
was
said
about
marian
or
gilbert
plans
for
the
future
in
his
own
mind
that
one
subject
reigned
supreme
shutting
out
every
other
thought
but
he
did
not
want
to
make
himself
a
nuisance
to
john
saltram
and
he
knew
that
there
are
bounds
to
the
endurance
of
which
friendship
is
capable
the
two
friends
seemed
cheerful
enough
as
they
smoked
their
cigars
in
the
summer
dusk
the
quiet
of
the
flagged
court
below
rarely
broken
by
a
passing
footfall
it
was
the
pleasantest
evening
which
gilbert
fenton
had
spent
for
a
long
time
in
spite
of
the
heavy
burden
on
his
mind
in
spite
of
the
depressing
view
which
saltram
took
of
his
position
dear
old
john
he
said
as
they
shook
hands
at
parting
i
can
not
tell
you
what
a
happiness
it
has
been
to
me
to
see
you
again
we
were
never
separated
so
long
before
since
the
day
when
i
ate
my
first
dinner
at
balliol
the
other
seemed
touched
by
this
expression
of
regard
but
disinclined
to
betray
his
emotion
after
the
manner
of
englishmen
on
such
occasions
my
dear
gilbert
it
ought
to
be
very
pleasant
to
me
to
hear
that
but
i
doubt
if
i
am
worthy
of
so
much
as
far
as
my
own
liking
for
you
goes
there
is
no
inequality
between
us
but
you
are
a
better
fellow
than
i
am
by
a
long
way
and
are
not
likely
to
profit
much
in
the
by
your
friendship
for
a
reprobate
like
me
that
all
nonsense
john
that
kind
of
vague
means
nothing
i
have
no
doubt
i
shall
live
to
see
you
a
great
man
and
to
be
proud
enough
of
being
able
to
claim
you
as
the
chosen
friend
of
my
youth
branston
death
has
cleared
the
way
for
you
the
chances
of
a
distinguished
future
are
within
your
grasp
the
chances
within
my
grasp
yes
my
dear
gilbert
i
tell
you
there
are
some
men
for
whom
everything
in
this
world
comes
too
late
what
do
you
mean
by
that
only
that
i
doubt
if
you
will
ever
see
me
adela
branston
husband
i
ca
understand
you
john
my
dear
fellow
there
is
nothing
strange
in
that
there
are
times

i
can
not
understand
myself
chapter
jacob
nowell
the
days
went
by
and
brought
gilbert
fenton
no
reply
to
his
advertisement
he
called
at
the
morning
and
evening
only
to
find
the
same
result
and
a
dull
blank
feeling
a
kind
of
deadness
of
heart
and
mind
began
to
steal
over
him
with
the
progress
of
the
days
he
went
through
the
routine
of
his
steadily
enough
working
as
hard
as
he
had
ever
worked
but
it
was
only
by
a
supreme
effort
that
he
could
bring
his
mind
to
bear
upon
the
details
of
business
all
interest
in
his
was
gone
the
advertisement
had
appeared
for
the
sixth
time
and
gilbert
had
framed
a
second
offering
a
reward
of
twenty
pounds
for
any
direct
evidence
of
the
marriage
of
marian
nowell
when
a
letter
was
handed
to
him
one
evening
at
the
a
letter
in
a
common
blue
envelope
directed
in
a
curious
crabbed
hand
and
bearing
the
london
his
heart
beat
loud
and
fast
as
he
tore
open
this
envelope
it
contained
only
a
of
paper
with
these
words
written
upon
it
in
the
cramped
hand
which
figured
on
the
outside
the
person
advertising
for
marian
nowell
is
requested
to
call
at
no
queen
anne
court
wardour
street
any
evening
after
seven
this
was
all
little
as
this
brief
note
implied
however
gilbert
made
sure
that
the
writer
must
be
in
a
position
to
give
him
some
kind
of
information
about
the
object
of
his
search
it
was
six
when
he
received
the
communication
he
went
from
the
to
his
lodgings
with
his
mind
in
a
tumult
of
excitement
made
a
mere
pretence
of
taking
a
hasty
dinner
and
set
off
immediately
afterwards
for
wardour
street
there
was
more
than
time
for
him
to
walk
and
he
hoped
that
the
walk
might
have
some
effect
in
reducing
the
fever
of
his
mind
he
did
not
want
to
present
himself
before
strangers
who
no
doubt
only
wanted
to
make
a
barter
of
any
knowledge
they
possessed
as
to
marian
whereabouts
in
a
state
of
mental
excitement
the
address
to
which
he
was
going
mystified
him
beyond
measure
what
could
people
living
in
such
a
place
as
this
know
of
her
whom
he
sought
he
was
in
wardour
street
at
a
quarter
before
seven
but
he
had
considerable
trouble
in
finding
queen
anne
court
and
the
clocks
of
the
neighbourhood
were
striking
the
hour
as
he
turned
into
a
narrow
alley
with
shops
on
one
side
and
a
high
dead
wall
on
the
other
the
gas
was
glimmering
faintly
in
the
window
of
no
and
a
good
deal
of
old
silver
tarnished
and
blackened
huddled
together
behind
the
glass
was
dimly
visible
in
the
uncertain
light
there
was
some
old
jewellery
too
and
a
little
wooden
bowl
of
sovereigns
or
gold
coins
of
some
kind
or
other
on
a
brass
plate
upon
the
door
of
this
establishment
there
appeared
the
name
of
jacob
nowell
silversmith
and
gilbert
fenton
stared
in
amazement
at
this
inscription
it
must
needs
be
some
relative
of
marian
he
was
about
to
see
he
opened
the
door
bewildered
a
little
by
this
discovery
and
a
shrill
bell
gave
notice
of
his
entrance
to
those
within
a
tall
lanky
young
man
with
a
sallow
face
and
sleek
black
hair
emerged
quickly
from
some
door
in
the
obscure
background
and
asked
in
a
sharp
voice
what
the
visitor
pleased
to
want
i
wish
to
see
nowell
the
writer
of
a
letter
addressed
to
the
in
wigmore
street
the
young
man
disappeared
without
a
word
leaving
gilbert
standing
in
the
dimly
lighted
shop
where
he
saw
more
old
silver
crowded
upon
shelves
behind
glass
doors
carved
ebony
cabinets
looming
out
of
the
dusk
and
here
and
there
an
old
picture
in
a
tarnished
frame
on
the
counter
there
was
a
glass
case
containing
foreign
and
gold
some
curious
old
watches
and
other
trinkets
a
baby
coral
a
battered
silver
cup
and
a
gold
while
gilbert
waited
thus
he
heard
voices
in
a
room
at
the
back
the
shrill
tones
of
the
sallow
young
man
and
a
feeble
old
voice
raised
querulously
and
then
after
a
delay
which
seemed
long
to
his
impatience
the
young
man
reappeared
and
told
him
nowell
was
ready
to
see
him
gilbert
went
into
the
room
at
the
end
of
the
shop
a
small
dark
parlour
more
crowded
with
a
heterogeneous
collection
of
plate
pictures
and
of
all
kinds
than
the
shop
itself
sultry
as
the
july
evening
was
there
was
a
fire
burning
in
the
pinched
rusty
grate
and
over
this
fire
the
owner
of
the
room
bent
affectionately
with
his
slippered
feet
on
the
fender
and
his
bony
hands
clasping
his
bony
knees
he
was
an
old
man
with
long
hair
streaming
from
beneath
a
velvet
and
bright
black
eyes
deep
set
in
a
pale
thin
face
his
nose
was
a
sharp
aquiline
and
gave
something
of
a
aspect
to
a
countenance
that
must
once
have
been
very
handsome
he
was
wrapped
in
a
long
of
some
thick
grey
woollen
stuff
the
young
man
lingered
by
the
door
between
the
parlour
and
the
shop
as
if
he
would
fain
have
remained
a
witness
to
the
interview
about
to
take
place
between
his
master
and
the
stranger
but
the
old
man
looked
round
at
him
sharply
and
said
that
will
do
tulliver
you
can
go
back
to
the
shop
if
abrahams
brings
that
little
lot
again
tell
him
i
give
an
ounce
not
a
fraction
more
tulliver
retired
leaving
the
door
ajar
ever
so
little
but
the
penetrating
black
eyes
of
the
master
were
quick
to
perceive
this
manoeuvre
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
shut
that
door
sir
quite
securely
he
said
to
gilbert
that
young
man
is
very
inquisitive
i
afraid
i
kept
him
too
long
people
talk
of
old
servants
but
half
the
robberies
in
the
world
are
committed
by
old
servants
be
seated
if
you
please
sir
you
find
this
room
rather
close
perhaps
some
people
do
but
i
old
and
chilly
and
i
ca
live
without
a
fire
i
have
come
to
you
in
great
anxiety
of
mind
said
gilbert
as
he
seated
himself
upon
the
only
disengaged
chair
in
the
room
and
with
some
hope
that
you
may
be
able
to
set
my
mind
at
ease
by
affording
me
information
about
miss
marian
nowell
i
can
give
you
no
information
about
her
indeed
cried
gilbert
with
a
bitter
pang
of
disappointment
and
yet
you
answered
my
advertisement
i
did
because
i
have
some
reason
to
suppose
this
marian
nowell
may
be
my
granddaughter
that
is
quite
possible
can
you
tell
me
her
father
name
percival
nowell
her
mother
was
a
miss
lucy
geoffry
right
said
the
old
man
percival
nowell
was
my
only
son
my
only
child
of
late
years
there
was
a
girl
but
she
died
early
he
was
my
only
son
and
his
mother
and
i
were
foolish
enough
to
be
proud
of
his
good
looks
and
his
clever
ways
and
we
brought
him
up
a
gentleman
sent
him
to
an
expensive
school
and
after
that
to
the
university
and
pinched
ourselves
in
every
way
for
his
sake
my
father
was
a
gentleman
and
it
was
only
after
i
had
failed
as
a
professional
man
through
circumstances
which
i
need
not
explain
to
you
now
that
i
took
to
this
business
i
would
have
made
any
sacrifice
in
reason
for
that
boy
of
mine
i
wanted
him
to
be
a
gentleman
and
to
make
his
way
in
one
of
the
learned
professions
after
a
great
deal
of
chopping
and
changing
he
fixed
upon
the
bar
took
chambers
in
the
temple
made
me
pay
all
the
fees
and
pretended
to
study
but
i
soon
found
that
he
was
leading
a
wild
dissipated
life
and
was
never
likely
to
be
good
for
anything
he
got
into
debt
drew
bills
upon
me
and
behaved
altogether
in
a
most
shameful
manner
when
i
sent
for
him
and
remonstrated
with
him
upon
his
disgraceful
conduct
he
told
me
that
i
was
a
miser
that
i
spent
my
life
in
a
for
the
sake
of
hoarding
money
and
that
i
deserved
nothing
better
than
his
treatment
of
me
i
may
have
been
better
off
at
this
time
than
i
had
cared
to
let
him
know
for
i
had
soon
found
out
what
a
reckless
scoundrel
i
had
to
deal
with
but
if
he
had
behaved
decently
he
would
have
found
me
generous
and
indulgent
enough
as
it
was
i
told
him
to
go
about
his
business
and
never
to
expect
another
sixpence
from
me
as
long
as
he
lived
how
he
managed
to
exist
after
this
i
hardly
know
he
was
very
much
mixed
up
with
a
disreputable
lot
of
and
i
believe
he
made
money
by
betting
his
mother
robbed
me
for
him
i
found
out
afterwards
and
contrived
to
send
him
a
good
deal
of
money
at
odd
times
my
business
as
a
dealer
in
silver
was
better
then
than
it
is
now
and
i
had
had
so
much
money
passing
through
my
hands
that
it
was
pretty
easy
for
my
wife
to
cheat
me
poor
soul
she
has
been
dead
and
gone
these
fifteen
years
and
i
have
freely
forgiven
her
she
loved
that
young
man
to
distraction
if
he
had
wanted
a
step
to
reach
the
object
of
his
wishes
she
would
have
laid
herself
down
in
the
dust
and
let
him
walk
over
her
body
i
suppose
it
is
in
the
nature
of
mothers
to
love
their
sons
like
that
well
sir
i
never
saw
my
gentleman
after
that
day
i
had
plenty
of
letters
from
him
all
asking
for
money
threatening
letters
pitiful
letters
letters
in
which
he
swore
he
would
destroy
himself
if
he
did
receive
a
remittance
by
return
of
post
but
i
never
sent
him
a
shilling
about
a
year
after
our
last
meeting
i
received
the
announcement
of
his
marriage
with
miss
geoffry
he
wrote
to
tell
me
that
if
i
would
allow
him
a
decent
income
he
would
reform
and
lead
a
steady
life
that
letter
i
did
answer
to
the
effect
that
if
he
chose
to
come
here
and
act
as
my
shopman
i
would
give
him
board
and
lodging
for
himself
and
his
wife
and
such
wages
as
he
should
deserve
i
told
him
that
i
had
given
him
his
chance
as
a
gentleman
and
he
had
thrown
it
away
i
would
give
him
the
opportunity
now
of
succeeding
in
a
humbler
career
by
sheer
industry
and
perseverance
as
i
had
succeeded
myself
if
he
thought
that
i
had
made
a
fortune
there
was
so
much
the
more
reason
for
him
to
try
his
luck
this
was
the
last
letter
i
ever
wrote
to
him
it
was
unanswered
but
about
a
year
and
a
half
afterwards
there
came
a
few
lines
to
his
mother
telling
her
of
the
birth
of
a
daughter
which
was
to
be
called
marian
after
her
this
last
letter
came
from
brussels
and
did
you
hear
no
more
of
your
son
after
this
gilbert
asked
nothing
i
think
his
mother
used
to
get
letters
from
him
in
secret
for
some
time
that
these
failed
suddenly
at
last
and
that
anxiety
about
her
worthless
son
anxiety
which
she
tried
to
hide
from
me
shortened
her
life
she
never
complained
poor
soul
never
mentioned
percy
name
until
the
last
when
she
begged
me
to
be
kind
to
him
if
he
should
ever
come
to
throw
himself
upon
my
kindness
i
gave
her
my
promise
that
if
that
came
to
pass
he
should
find
me
a
better
friend
to
him
than
he
deserved
it
is
hard
to
refuse
the
last
prayer
of
a
faithful
wife
who
has
done
her
duty
patiently
for
nearly
thirty
years
have
you
any
reason
to
suppose
your
son
still
living
i
have
no
evidence
of
his
death
often
and
often
after
my
poor
wife
was
gone
i
have
sat
alone
here
of
a
night
thinking
of
him
thinking
that
he
might
come
in
upon
me
at
any
moment
almost
listening
for
his
footstep
in
the
quiet
of
the
place
but
he
never
came
he
would
have
found
me
very
at
such
times
my
mind
changed
to
him
a
good
deal
after
his
mother
death
i
used
to
think
of
him
as
he
was
in
his
boyhood
when
marian
and
i
had
such
great
hopes
of
him
and
would
sit
and
talk
of
him
for
hours
together
by
this
fireside
an
old
man
left
quite
alone
as
i
was
had
plenty
of
time
for
such
thoughts
night
after
night
i
have
fancied
i
heard
his
step
and
have
looked
up
at
that
door
expecting
to
see
him
open
it
and
come
in
but
he
never
came
he
may
be
dead
i
suppose
he
is
dead
or
he
would
have
come
to
make
another
attempt
at
getting
money
out
of
me
you
have
never
taken
any
measures
for
finding
him
inquired
gilbert
no
if
he
wanted
me
he
knew
where
i
was
to
be
found
was
a
fixture
it
was
his
business
to
come
to
me
when
i
saw
the
name
of
marian
nowell
in
your
advertisement
a
week
ago
i
felt
curious
to
know
whether
it
could
be
my
grandchild
you
were
looking
for
i
held
off
till
this
morning
thinking
it
was
worth
my
while
to
make
any
inquiries
about
the
matter
but
i
could
get
it
out
of
my
head
somehow
and
it
ended
by
my
answering
your
advertisement
i
am
an
old
man
you
see
without
a
creature
belonging
to
me
and
it
might
be
a
comfort
to
me
to
meet
with
some
one
of
my
own
flesh
and
blood
the
bit
of
money
i
may
leave
behind
me
when
i
die
wo
be
much
but
it
might
as
well
go
to
my
son
child
as
to
a
stranger
if
your
son
child
can
be
found
you
will
discover
her
to
be
well
worthy
of
your
love
yes
though
she
has
done
me
a
cruel
wrong
i
believe
her
to
be
all
that
is
good
and
pure
and
true
what
is
the
wrong
that
she
has
done
you
gilbert
told
jacob
nowell
the
story
of
his
engagement
and
the
bitter
disappointment
which
had
befallen
him
on
his
return
from
australia
the
old
man
listened
with
every
appearance
of
interest
he
approved
of
gilbert
notion
of
advertising
for
the
particulars
of
a
possible
marriage
and
offered
to
bear
his
part
in
the
expenses
of
the
search
for
his
granddaughter
gilbert
smiled
at
this
offer
you
do
not
know
what
a
worthless
thing
money
is
to
me
now
he
said
or
now
lightly
i
hold
my
own
trouble
or
loss
in
this
matter
he
left
queen
anne
court
soon
after
this
after
having
promised
jacob
nowell
to
return
and
report
progress
so
soon
as
there
should
be
anything
worth
telling
he
went
back
to
wigmore
street
depressed
by
the
reaction
that
followed
the
vain
hope
which
the
silversmith
letter
had
inspired
it
mattered
little
to
him
to
know
the
antecedents
of
marian
father
while
marian
destiny
remained
still
hidden
from
him
chapter
xi
the
marriage
at
wygrove
on
the
following
day
gilbert
fenton
took
his
second
advertisement
to
the
office
in
printing
house
square
an
advertisement
offering
a
reward
of
twenty
pounds
for
any
reliable
information
as
to
the
marriage
of
marian
nowell
a
week
went
by
during
which
the
advertisement
appeared
on
alternate
days
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
there
came
a
letter
from
the
of
wygrove
a
small
town
about
forty
miles
farther
from
london
than
lidford
stating
that
on
the
of
march
john
holbrook
and
marian
nowell
had
been
married
at
the
church
in
that
place
gilbert
fenton
left
london
by
an
early
train
upon
the
morning
after
his
receipt
of
this
letter
and
at
about
three
in
the
afternoon
found
himself
on
the
outskirts
of
wygrove
rather
a
difficult
place
to
reach
involving
a
good
deal
of
delay
at
junctions
and
a
journey
by
from
the
nearest
station
it
was
about
the
dullest
dreariest
little
town
to
which
his
destiny
had
ever
brought
gilbert
fenton
consisting
of
a
melancholy
with
a
blank
and
a
town
hall
that
looked
as
if
it
had
not
been
opened
within
the
memory
of
man
a
grand
old
gothic
church
much
too
large
for
the
requirements
of
the
place
a
grim
square
brick
box
inscribed
ebenezer
and
a
few
prim
villas
straggling
off
into
the
country
on
one
side
of
the
church
there
was
a
curious
little
court
wonderfully
neat
and
clean
with
houses
the
parlours
whereof
were
sunk
below
the
level
of
the
pavement
after
the
manner
of
these
old
places
there
was
a
great
show
of
geraniums
in
the
casements
and
a
general
aspect
of
brightness
and
order
distinguished
all
these
modest
dwellings
it
was
to
this
court
that
fenton
had
been
directed
on
inquiring
for
thomas
stoneham
the
at
the
inn
where
the
coach
deposited
him
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
stoneham
sunning
himself
on
the
threshold
of
his
domicile
smoking
an
pipe
a
pleasant
clattering
of
sounded
from
the
neat
little
parlour
within
showing
that
early
as
it
was
there
were
already
preparations
for
the
cup
which
cheers
without
inebriating
in
the
stoneham
household
thomas
stoneham
supported
by
a
door
of
a
vivid
green
and
an
extensive
brass
plate
engraved
with
his
name
and
functions
was
a
personage
of
some
dignity
he
was
a
man
ponderous
and
slow
of
motion
with
a
latent
pomposity
which
he
rendered
as
agreeable
as
possible
by
the
urbanity
of
his
manners
he
was
a
man
of
a
lofty
spirit
who
believed
in
his
office
as
something
exalted
above
all
other
dignities
of
this
earth
less
lucrative
of
course
than
a
bishopric
or
the
woolsack
and
of
a
narrower
range
but
quite
as
important
on
a
small
scale
the
world
might
get
on
pretty
well
without
bishops
thought
stoneham
when
he
pondered
upon
these
things
as
he
smoked
his
churchwarden
pipe
but
what
would
become
of
a
parish
in
which
there
was
no
clerk
this
gentleman
seeing
gilbert
fenton
approach
was
quick
to
surmise
that
the
stranger
came
in
answer
to
the
letter
he
had
written
the
day
before
the
advent
of
a
stranger
in
wygrove
was
so
rare
an
occurrence
that
it
was
natural
enough
for
him
to
jump
at
this
conclusion
i
believe
you
are
stoneham
said
gilbert
and
the
writer
of
a
letter
in
answer
to
an
advertisement
in
the
my
name
is
stoneham
sir
i
am
the
clerk
of
this
parish
and
have
been
for
twenty
years
and
more
as
i
think
i
may
have
stated
in
the
letter
to
which
you
refer
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
step
inside
stoneham
waved
his
hand
towards
the
parlour
to
which
apartment
gilbert
descended
here
he
found
stoneham
a
meek
little
woman
who
seemed
to
be
borne
down
by
the
weight
of
her
lord
dignity
and
miss
stoneham
also
meek
and
sandy
with
a
great
many
stiff
little
corkscrew
ringlets
budding
out
all
over
her
head
and
a
sharp
little
inquiring
nose
these
ladies
would
have
retired
on
gilbert
entrance
but
he
begged
them
to
remain
and
after
a
good
deal
of
polite
hesitation
they
consented
to
do
so
stoneham
resuming
her
seat
before
the
and
miss
stoneham
retiring
to
a
little
table
by
the
window
where
she
was
engaged
in
trimming
a
bonnet
i
want
to
know
all
about
this
marriage
stoneham
gilbert
began
when
he
had
seated
himself
in
a
shining
mahogany
by
the
empty
first
and
foremost
i
want
you
to
tell
me
where
and
holbrook
are
now
living
the
shook
his
head
with
a
stately
slowness
not
to
be
done
sir
he
said
when
and
holbrook
left
here
they
went
the
lord
knows
where
they
went
away
the
very
day
they
were
married
there
was
a
fly
waiting
for
them
at
the
with
their
luggage
upon
it
when
the
ceremony
was
over
ready
to
drive
them
to
grangewick
station
i
saw
them
get
into
it
and
drive
away
and
every
mortal
thing
that
i
know
as
to
what
became
of
them
after
they
were
married
in
yonder
church
you
do
know
who
this
holbrook
is
no
more
than
the
babe
unborn
sir
he
was
a
stranger
in
this
place
was
only
here
long
enough
to
get
the
license
for
his
marriage
i
should
take
him
to
be
a
gentleman
but
he
was
a
pleasant
person
to
speak
to
rather
in
his
manners
he
was
the
sort
of
man
i
should
have
chosen
if
i
been
a
pretty
young
woman
like
miss
nowell
but
there
no
accounting
for
taste
and
she
seemed
uncommonly
fond
of
him
i
never
saw
any
one
more
agitated
than
she
was
when
they
were
married
she
was
crying
in
a
quiet
way
all
through
the
service
and
when
it
was
over
she
fainted
i
daresay
it
did
seem
hard
to
her
to
be
married
like
that
without
so
much
as
a
friend
to
give
her
away
she
was
in
mourning
too
deep
mourning
can
you
give
me
any
description
of
this
man
this
mr
holbrook
well
no
sir
he
was
an
ordinary
kind
of
person
to
look
at
might
be
any
age
between
thirty
and
forty
not
a
gentleman
that
i
should
have
taken
a
fancy
to
myself
as
i
said
before
but
young
women
are
that
wayward
and
uncertain
like
there
no
knowing
where
to
have
them
was
miss
nowell
long
at
wygrove
before
her
marriage
about
three
weeks
she
lodged
with
miss
long
up
the
town
a
friend
of
my
daughter
if
you
like
to
ask
any
questions
of
miss
long
our
jemima
might
step
round
there
with
you
presently
i
should
be
very
glad
to
do
so
gilbert
answered
quickly
he
asked
several
more
questions
but
stoneham
could
give
him
no
information
except
as
to
the
bare
fact
of
the
marriage
gilbert
knew
now
that
the
girl
he
had
so
fondly
loved
and
so
entirely
trusted
was
utterly
lost
to
him
that
he
had
been
jilted
cruelly
and
heartlessly
as
he
could
but
own
to
himself
yes
she
had
jilted
him
had
in
all
probability
never
loved
him
he
blamed
himself
for
having
urged
his
suit
too
ardently
with
little
reference
to
marian
own
feelings
with
a
rooted
obstinate
conviction
that
he
needed
only
to
win
her
in
order
to
insure
the
happiness
of
both
having
fully
proved
stoneham
inability
to
afford
him
any
further
help
in
this
business
gilbert
availed
himself
of
the
fair
willingness
to
step
round
to
miss
long
domicile
with
him
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
fuller
information
from
that
lady
while
miss
stoneham
was
engaged
in
putting
on
her
bonnet
for
this
expedition
the
clerk
proposed
to
take
gilbert
across
to
the
church
and
show
him
the
entry
of
the
marriage
in
the
register
with
a
view
to
the
satisfactory
settlement
of
the
reward
stoneham
added
in
a
fat
voice
and
with
the
air
of
a
man
to
whom
twenty
pounds
more
or
less
was
an
affair
of
very
little
moment
gilbert
assented
to
this
and
accompanied
stoneham
to
a
little
which
admitted
them
into
the
old
church
where
the
light
shone
dimly
through
painted
windows
in
which
there
seemed
more
leaden
framework
than
glass
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
was
cold
even
on
this
sultry
july
afternoon
and
the
vestry
to
which
stoneham
conducted
his
companion
had
a
damp
mouldy
smell
he
opened
a
cupboard
with
a
good
deal
of
jingling
of
a
great
bunch
of
keys
and
produced
the
register
a
volume
bound
in
dingy
leather
and
calculated
to
inspire
gloomy
feelings
in
the
minds
of
the
bridegrooms
and
brides
who
had
occasion
to
inscribe
their
names
therein
a
volume
upon
which
the
loves
and
the
graces
who
hover
around
the
entrance
to
the
matrimonial
state
had
shed
no
ray
of
glamour
thomas
stoneham
laid
this
book
before
gilbert
open
at
the
page
on
which
marian
marriage
was
recorded
yes
there
was
the
familiar
signature
in
the
fair
flowing
hand
he
had
loved
so
well
it
was
his
marian
and
no
other
whom
john
holbrook
had
married
in
that
gloomy
old
church
the
signature
of
the
bridegroom
was
in
a
stiff
straight
hand
all
the
letters
formed
with
unusual
precision
as
if
the
name
had
been
written
in
a
slow
laboured
way
who
could
this
john
holbrook
be
gilbert
was
quite
certain
that
he
had
never
heard
the
name
at
lidford
nor
could
he
believe
that
if
any
attachment
between
this
man
and
marian
nowell
had
existed
before
his
own
acquaintance
with
her
captain
sedgewick
would
have
been
so
dishonourable
as
to
keep
the
fact
a
secret
from
him
this
john
holbrook
must
needs
therefore
be
some
one
who
had
come
to
lidford
during
gilbert
absence
from
england
yet
sarah
down
had
been
able
to
tell
him
of
no
new
visitor
at
hazel
cottage
he
copied
the
record
of
the
marriage
on
a
leaf
in
his
paid
stoneham
a
couple
of
notes
and
left
the
church
the
clerk
daughter
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
little
court
outside
and
they
went
at
once
to
the
house
where
miss
nowell
had
lodged
during
her
residence
at
wygrove
it
was
a
house
in
a
neat
little
terrace
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
a
house
approached
by
a
flight
of
steep
stone
steps
of
spotless
purity
and
a
door
which
opened
at
once
into
a
bright
parlour
faintly
perfumed
with
and
lavender
mouldering
in
the
china
vases
on
the
mantelpiece
here
gilbert
was
introduced
to
miss
long
a
maiden
lady
of
uncertain
age
who
wore
stiff
bands
of
suspiciously
black
hair
under
an
imposing
structure
of
lace
and
artificial
flowers
and
a
rusty
dress
the
body
of
which
fitted
so
tightly
as
to
seem
like
a
kind
of
armour
this
lady
received
fenton
very
graciously
and
declared
herself
quite
ready
to
give
him
any
information
in
her
power
about
miss
nowell
it
happened
unfortunately
however
that
her
power
was
of
a
most
limited
extent
a
sweeter
young
lady
never
lived
than
miss
nowell
she
said
i
had
a
great
many
people
occupying
these
apartments
since
my
father
death
left
me
thrown
upon
my
own
resources
i
had
lodgers
that
i
might
call
permanent
in
a
manner
of
speaking
but
i
never
had
any
one
that
i
took
to
as
i
took
to
miss
nowell
though
she
was
hardly
with
me
three
weeks
from
first
to
last
did
she
seem
happy
in
her
mind
during
that
time
gilbert
asked
well
no
i
can
not
say
that
she
did
i
should
have
expected
to
see
a
young
lady
that
was
going
to
be
married
to
the
man
she
loved
much
more
cheerful
and
hopeful
about
the
future
than
miss
nowell
was
she
told
me
that
her
uncle
had
not
been
dead
many
weeks
and
i
thought
at
first
that
this
was
the
only
grief
she
had
on
her
mind
but
after
some
time
when
i
found
her
very
low
and
downhearted
and
had
won
upon
her
to
trust
me
almost
as
if
i
had
been
an
old
friend
she
owned
to
me
that
she
had
behaved
very
badly
to
a
gentleman
she
had
been
engaged
to
and
that
the
thought
of
her
wickedness
to
him
preyed
upon
her
mind
do
think
any
good
can
ever
come
of
my
marriage
miss
long
she
said
to
me
think
i
must
surely
be
punished
for
my
falsehood
to
the
good
man
who
loved
me
so
truly
but
there
are
some
things
in
life
that
seem
like
fate
they
come
upon
us
in
a
moment
and
we
have
no
strength
to
fight
against
them
i
believe
it
was
my
fate
to
love
john
holbrook
there
is
nothing
in
this
world
i
could
refuse
to
do
for
his
sake
if
he
had
asked
me
for
my
life
i
must
have
given
it
to
him
as
freely
as
i
gave
him
my
love
from
the
first
hour
in
which
i
saw
him
he
was
my
master
this
holbrook
was
very
fond
of
her
i
suppose
i
daresay
he
was
sir
but
he
was
not
a
man
that
showed
his
feelings
very
much
they
used
to
go
for
long
walks
together
though
it
was
march
and
cold
windy
weather
and
she
always
seemed
happier
when
he
brought
her
home
he
came
every
evening
to
drink
tea
with
her
and
i
used
to
hear
them
talking
as
i
sat
at
work
in
the
next
room
she
was
happy
enough
when
he
was
with
her
it
was
only
when
she
was
alone
that
she
would
give
way
to
low
spirits
and
gloomy
thoughts
about
the
future
did
she
ever
tell
you
anything
about
holbrook
his
position
or
profession
how
long
she
had
known
him
how
and
where
they
had
first
met
no
sir
she
told
me
once
that
he
was
not
rich
i
think
that
is
about
all
she
ever
said
of
him
except
when
she
spoke
of
his
influence
over
her
and
her
trust
in
him
have
you
any
idea
where
they
were
going
to
live
after
their
marriage
i
can
not
tell
you
the
name
of
the
place
miss
nowell
said
that
a
friend
of
holbrook
was
going
to
lend
him
an
old
in
a
very
pretty
part
of
the
country
it
would
be
very
lonely
she
said
and
her
husband
would
have
sometimes
to
leave
her
to
attend
to
his
business
in
london
but
she
would
not
mind
that
day
i
daresay
he
will
let
me
live
in
london
with
him
she
said
i
do
like
to
ask
him
that
yet
did
she
drop
no
hint
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
this
place
to
which
they
were
going
it
was
somewhere
in
hampshire
that
is
all
i
can
remember
i
would
give
a
great
deal
to
know
more
gilbert
said
with
a
sigh
in
what
manner
did
this
holbrook
impress
you
you
were
interested
in
the
young
lady
and
would
therefore
naturally
be
interested
in
her
lover
did
he
strike
you
as
worthy
of
her
can
not
say
that
he
did
sir
miss
long
answered
doubtfully
i
could
see
that
he
had
great
power
over
her
though
his
manner
to
her
was
always
very
gentle
but
i
can
not
say
that
i
took
to
him
myself
i
daresay
he
is
a
very
clever
man
but
he
had
a
cold
proud
way
that
kept
one
at
a
distance
from
him
and
i
seemed
to
know
no
more
of
him
at
the
last
than
i
had
known
on
the
first
day
i
saw
him
i
believe
he
loved
miss
nowell
and
that
about
all
the
good
i
do
believe
of
him
after
this
there
was
no
more
to
be
asked
of
miss
long
so
gilbert
thanked
her
for
her
civility
and
bade
good
evening
at
once
to
her
and
to
miss
stoneham
there
was
time
for
him
to
catch
the
last
coach
to
grangewick
station
he
determined
upon
going
from
grangewick
to
lidford
instead
of
returning
to
london
he
wanted
if
possible
to
find
out
something
more
about
this
man
holbrook
who
must
surely
have
been
known
to
some
one
at
lidford
during
his
secret
courtship
of
marian
nowell
he
wasted
two
days
at
lidford
making
inquiries
on
this
subject
in
as
quiet
a
manner
as
possible
and
in
every
imaginable
quarter
but
without
the
slightest
result
no
one
either
at
lidford
or
fairleigh
had
ever
heard
of
holbrook
gilbert
last
inquiries
were
made
in
a
singular
direction
after
exhausting
every
likely
channel
of
information
he
had
a
few
hours
left
before
the
departure
of
the
fast
train
by
which
he
had
determined
to
return
to
london
and
this
leisure
he
devoted
to
a
visit
to
heatherly
park
in
the
chance
of
finding
sir
david
forster
at
home
it
was
just
possible
that
holbrook
might
be
one
of
sir
david
innumerable
bachelor
acquaintances
gilbert
walked
from
lidford
to
heatherly
by
that
romantic
woodland
path
by
which
he
had
gone
with
marian
and
her
uncle
on
the
bright
september
afternoon
when
he
first
saw
sir
david
house
the
solitary
walk
awakened
very
bitter
thoughts
the
memory
of
those
hopes
which
had
then
made
the
sunshine
of
his
life
and
without
which
existence
seemed
a
weary
purposeless
journey
across
a
desert
land
sir
david
was
at
home
the
woman
at
the
lodge
told
him
and
he
went
on
to
the
house
and
rang
a
great
clanging
bell
which
made
an
alarming
clamour
in
the
utter
stillness
of
the
place
a
old
servant
answered
the
summons
and
ushered
gilbert
into
the
state
an
apartment
with
a
lofty
arched
roof
eight
long
windows
and
a
generally
ecclesiastical
aspect
which
was
more
suggestive
of
solemn
grandeur
than
of
domestic
comfort
here
gilbert
waited
for
about
ten
minutes
at
the
end
of
which
time
the
man
returned
to
request
that
he
would
be
so
kind
as
to
go
to
sir
study
his
master
was
something
of
an
invalid
the
man
told
gilbert
they
went
through
the
to
a
very
snug
little
apartment
with
walls
and
one
large
window
opening
upon
a
on
the
southern
side
of
the
house
there
was
a
ponderous
bookcase
on
one
side
of
the
room
on
all
the
others
the
paraphernalia
of
sporting
gunnery
and
whips
and
artistically
arranged
against
the
panelling
and
over
the
mantelpiece
an
elaborate
collection
of
meerschaum
pipes
through
a
door
gilbert
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
comfortable
bedchamber
leading
out
of
this
room
sir
david
was
sitting
on
a
low
near
the
window
with
one
leg
supported
on
a
rest
invented
for
the
relief
of
gouty
subjects
although
not
yet
forty
the
baronet
was
a
chronic
sufferer
from
this
complaint
my
dear
fenton
how
good
of
you
to
come
to
me
he
exclaimed
shaking
hands
very
cordially
with
gilbert
here
i
am
laid
by
the
heels
in
this
dreary
old
place
and
quite
alone
you
ca
imagine
what
a
treat
it
is
to
see
a
friendly
intelligent
face
from
the
outer
world
the
purpose
of
my
visit
is
such
a
purely
selfish
one
that
i
am
really
ashamed
to
receive
such
a
kindly
greeting
sir
david
if
i
had
known
you
were
here
and
an
invalid
i
should
have
gladly
come
to
see
you
but
i
did
know
it
i
have
been
at
lidford
on
a
matter
of
business
for
the
last
two
days
and
i
came
here
on
the
hazard
of
finding
you
and
with
a
faint
hope
that
you
might
be
able
to
give
me
some
help
in
an
affair
which
is
supremely
important
to
me
sir
david
forster
looked
at
gilbert
fenton
curiously
for
a
moment
and
then
took
up
an
empty
meerschaum
that
lay
upon
a
little
table
near
him
and
began
to
fill
it
with
a
thoughtful
air
gilbert
had
dropped
into
an
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
open
window
and
was
watching
the
baronet
face
puzzled
a
little
by
that
curious
transient
expression
which
had
just
flitted
across
it
what
is
the
business
sir
david
asked
presently
and
how
can
i
be
of
use
to
you
i
think
you
knew
all
about
my
engagement
to
miss
nowell
when
i
was
here
last
september
sir
david
gilbert
began
presently
yes
saltram
told
me
you
were
engaged
not
but
what
it
was
easy
enough
to
see
how
the
land
lay
without
any
telling
miss
nowell
has
jilted
me
i
love
her
too
dearly
to
be
able
to
entertain
any
vindictive
feeling
against
her
but
i
do
feel
vindictively
disposed
towards
the
man
who
has
robbed
me
of
her
for
i
know
that
only
a
very
powerful
influence
would
have
induced
her
to
break
faith
with
me
and
this
man
must
needs
have
known
the
dishonourable
thing
he
was
doing
when
he
tempted
her
away
from
me
i
want
to
know
who
he
is
sir
david
and
how
he
came
to
acquire
such
an
influence
over
my
plighted
wife
my
dear
fenton
you
are
going
on
so
fast
you
say
miss
nowell
has
jilted
you
she
is
married
to
some
one
else
then
i
suppose
she
is
married
to
a
holbrook
i
came
to
lidford
the
night
before
last
with
the
hope
of
finding
out
something
about
him
but
all
my
endeavours
have
resulted
in
failure
it
struck
me
at
last
as
a
kind
of
forlorn
hope
that
this
holbrook
might
possibly
be
one
of
your
autumnal
visitors
and
i
came
here
to
ask
you
that
question
no
answered
the
baronet
i
have
had
no
visitor
called
holbrook
is
the
name
quite
strange
to
yourself
entirely
strange
and
this
holbrook
is
now
miss
nowell
husband
and
you
want
to
know
who
he
is
with
what
end
i
want
to
find
the
man
who
has
done
me
the
deadliest
wrong
one
man
can
do
another
my
dear
fellow
do
you
see
that
it
is
fate
and
not
holbrook
that
has
done
you
this
wrong
if
miss
nowell
had
really
loved
you
as
she
ought
to
have
loved
you
it
would
have
been
quite
impossible
for
her
to
be
tempted
away
from
you
it
was
her
destiny
to
marry
this
holbrook
rely
upon
it
and
had
you
been
on
the
spot
to
protect
your
own
interests
the
result
would
have
been
just
the
same
believe
me
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
and
can
fully
sympathise
with
your
feelings
in
this
business
but
i
can
not
see
what
good
could
possibly
arise
out
of
a
meeting
between
you
and
your
fortunate
rival
the
days
of
duelling
are
past
and
even
if
it
were
not
so
i
think
you
are
too
generous
to
seek
to
deprive
miss
nowell
of
her
husband
i
do
not
know
about
that
there
are
some
wrongs
which
all
a
christianity
is
not
wide
enough
to
cover
i
think
if
that
man
and
i
were
to
meet
there
would
be
very
little
question
of
mercy
on
my
side
i
hold
a
man
who
could
act
as
he
has
acted
unworthy
of
all
consideration
utterly
unworthy
of
the
woman
he
has
won
from
me
my
dear
fellow
you
know
the
old
saying
a
man
who
is
in
love
thinks
everything
fair
there
is
no
such
thing
as
honour
in
such
a
case
as
this
of
course
i
do
want
to
defend
this
holbrook
i
only
want
to
awaken
your
senses
to
the
absurdity
of
any
vindictive
pursuit
of
the
man
if
the
lady
did
not
love
you
believe
me
you
are
well
out
of
the
business
yes
that
is
what
every
one
would
tell
me
i
daresay
gilbert
answered
impatiently
but
is
there
to
be
no
atonement
for
my
broken
life
rendered
barren
to
me
by
this
man
act
i
tell
you
sir
david
there
is
no
such
thing
as
pardon
for
a
wrong
like
this
but
i
know
how
foolish
this
talk
must
seem
to
you
there
is
always
something
ridiculous
in
the
sufferings
of
a
jilted
lover
not
at
all
my
dear
fenton
i
heartily
wish
that
i
could
be
of
use
to
you
in
this
matter
but
there
is
very
little
chance
of
that
and
believe
me
there
is
only
one
rational
course
open
to
you
which
is
to
forget
miss
nowell
or
holbrook
with
all
possible
assiduity
gilbert
smiled
a
melancholy
incredulous
smile
sir
david
advice
was
only
the
echo
of
john
saltram
counsel
the
counsel
which
he
would
receive
from
every
man
of
the
world
no
doubt
the
counsel
which
he
himself
would
most
likely
have
given
to
a
friend
under
the
same
circumstances
sir
david
was
very
cordial
and
wanted
his
visitor
to
dine
and
sleep
at
heatherly
but
this
gilbert
declined
he
was
eager
to
get
back
to
london
now
that
his
business
was
finished
he
arrived
in
town
late
that
night
and
went
back
to
his
next
day
with
a
dreary
feeling
that
he
must
needs
go
through
the
same
dull
routine
day
after
day
in
all
the
time
to
come
without
purpose
or
hope
in
his
life
only
because
a
man
must
go
on
living
somehow
to
the
end
of
his
earthly
pilgrimage
whether
the
sun
shine
upon
him
or
not
he
went
to
queen
anne
court
one
evening
soon
after
his
return
and
told
nowell
all
he
had
discovered
at
wygrove
the
old
man
showed
himself
keenly
interested
in
his
fate
i
would
give
a
great
deal
to
see
her
before
i
die
he
said
whatever
i
have
to
leave
will
be
hers
it
may
be
little
or
much
i
wo
speak
about
that
but
i
lived
a
hard
life
and
saved
where
other
men
would
have
spent
i
should
like
to
see
my
son
child
i
should
like
to
have
some
one
of
my
own
flesh
and
blood
about
me
in
my
last
days
would
it
not
be
a
good
plan
to
put
an
advertisement
into
the
addressed
to
holbrook
from
a
relation
she
would
be
likely
to
answer
that
when
she
would
not
reply
to
any
appeal
coming
directly
from
me
yes
answered
jacob
nowell
and
her
husband
would
let
her
come
to
me
for
the
sake
of
what
i
may
have
to
leave
her
but
that
ca
be
helped
i
suppose
it
is
the
fate
of
a
man
who
lives
as
i
have
lived
to
be
cared
for
at
last
only
for
what
he
has
to
give
i
put
in
such
an
advertisement
as
you
speak
of
and
we
see
what
comes
of
it
chapter
xii
a
friendly
counsellor
gilbert
fenton
called
several
times
in
the
temple
without
being
able
to
see
john
saltram
a
slip
of
paper
pasted
on
the
outer
door
of
that
gentleman
chamber
informed
the
public
that
he
was
out
of
town
and
that
was
all
gilbert
took
the
trouble
to
penetrate
the
domicile
of
the
laundress
who
officiated
in
saltram
chambers
in
order
to
obtain
some
more
particular
information
as
to
her
employer
movements
and
after
infinite
difficulty
succeeded
in
finding
that
industrious
matron
in
the
remote
obscurity
of
a
narrow
court
near
the
river
but
the
laundress
could
tell
fenton
very
little
she
did
not
know
whither
saltram
had
gone
or
when
he
was
likely
to
return
he
was
one
of
the
most
uncertingest
gentlemen
she
had
to
do
for
and
he
had
been
out
of
town
a
great
deal
lately
which
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
considering
the
trying
hot
weather
when
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
gentlefolks
as
was
free
to
do
what
they
pleased
would
stay
in
london
it
was
hard
enough
upon
working
people
with
five
children
to
wash
and
mend
and
cook
for
and
over
in
the
court
besides
and
provisions
dearer
than
they
had
been
these
ten
years
gilbert
asked
if
saltram
had
left
any
orders
about
his
letters
but
the
woman
told
him
no
there
never
was
such
a
careless
gentleman
about
letters
he
never
cared
about
having
them
sent
after
him
and
would
let
them
lie
in
the
box
till
the
dust
got
thick
upon
them
gilbert
left
a
brief
note
for
john
saltram
with
the
woman
a
note
begging
his
friend
to
come
to
him
when
he
was
next
in
london
and
having
done
this
he
paid
no
more
visits
to
the
temple
but
waited
patiently
for
saltram
coming
feeling
very
sure
that
his
request
would
not
be
neglected
if
anything
could
have
intensified
the
gloom
of
his
mind
at
this
time
it
would
have
been
the
absence
of
that
one
friend
whom
he
loved
better
than
he
had
ever
loved
any
one
in
this
world
except
marian
nowell
he
stayed
in
town
all
through
the
blank
august
and
september
season
working
harder
than
he
had
worked
since
the
early
days
of
his
commercial
life
taking
neither
pleasure
nor
interest
in
anything
and
keeping
as
much
as
possible
out
of
the
way
of
all
his
old
acquaintance
no
answer
came
to
jacob
nowell
advertisement
although
it
appeared
several
times
and
the
old
man
began
to
despair
of
ever
seeing
his
granddaughter
gilbert
used
to
drop
in
upon
him
sometimes
of
an
evening
during
this
period
at
his
urgent
request
he
was
interested
in
the
solitary
silversmith
for
marian
sake
and
very
willingly
sacrificed
an
occasional
evening
for
his
gratification
he
fancied
that
these
visits
of
his
inspired
some
kind
of
jealousy
in
the
breast
of
the
shopman
who
regarded
him
always
on
these
occasions
with
a
look
of
suppressed
malevolence
and
by
every
stratagem
in
his
power
tried
to
find
out
the
nature
of
the
conversation
between
the
visitor
and
his
employer
making
all
kinds
of
excuses
to
come
into
the
parlour
and
showing
himself
proof
against
the
most
humiliating
treatment
from
his
master
does
that
young
man
expect
you
to
leave
him
money
and
does
he
look
upon
me
as
a
possible
rival
gilbert
asked
one
night
provoked
by
the
shopman
conduct
very
likely
nowell
answered
with
a
malicious
grin
one
gets
good
service
from
a
man
who
expects
his
reward
in
the
future
luke
tulliver
serves
me
very
well
indeed
and
of
course
i
am
not
responsible
for
his
delusions
do
you
know
nowell
that
is
a
man
i
should
scarcely
care
to
trust
to
my
mind
there
is
a
warning
of
danger
in
his
countenance
my
dear
sir
i
have
never
trusted
any
one
in
my
life
answered
the
silversmith
promptly
i
do
for
a
moment
suppose
that
luke
tulliver
would
be
honest
if
i
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
cheat
me
as
to
the
badness
of
his
countenance
that
is
so
much
the
better
i
like
to
deal
with
an
obvious
rogue
the
really
dangerous
subject
is
your
honest
fool
who
goes
on
straight
enough
till
he
has
lulled
one
into
a
false
security
and
then
turns
thief
all
at
once
at
the
instigation
of
some
clever
tempter
that
young
man
lives
in
the
house
with
you
i
suppose
yes
my
household
consists
of
luke
tulliver
and
an
old
woman
who
does
the
cooking
and
other
work
there
are
a
couple
of
garrets
at
the
top
of
the
house
where
the
two
sleep
my
own
bedroom
is
over
this
and
the
room
over
the
shop
is
full
of
pictures
and
other
unsaleable
stuff
which
i
have
seldom
occasion
to
show
anybody
my
business
is
not
what
it
once
was
fenton
i
have
made
some
rather
lucky
hits
in
the
way
of
in
the
course
of
my
business
career
but
i
have
done
a
big
line
lately
gilbert
was
inclined
to
believe
that
jacob
nowell
was
a
much
richer
man
than
he
cared
to
confess
and
that
the
fortune
which
marian
nowell
might
inherit
in
the
future
was
a
considerable
one
the
old
man
had
all
the
attributes
of
a
miser
the
house
in
which
he
lived
had
the
aspect
of
a
place
in
which
money
has
been
made
and
hoarded
day
by
day
through
long
dull
years
it
was
not
until
the
end
of
october
that
john
saltram
made
his
appearance
at
his
old
friend
lodgings
he
had
just
come
up
from
the
country
and
was
looking
his
best
brighter
and
younger
than
gilbert
had
seen
him
look
for
a
long
time
my
dear
jack
i
began
to
think
i
should
never
see
you
again
what
have
you
been
doing
all
this
time
and
where
have
you
been
i
have
been
hard
at
work
as
usual
for
the
reviews
down
oxford
way
at
a
little
place
on
the
river
and
how
has
the
world
been
going
with
you
gilbert
i
saw
your
advertisement
offering
a
reward
for
evidence
of
miss
nowell
marriage
was
there
any
result
yes
i
know
all
about
the
marriage
now
but
i
do
know
who
or
what
the
man
is
gilbert
answered
and
then
went
on
to
give
his
friend
a
detailed
account
of
his
experience
at
wygrove
and
his
visit
to
sir
david
forster
my
dear
foolish
gilbert
said
john
saltram
how
much
useless
trouble
you
have
given
yourself
was
it
not
enough
to
know
that
this
girl
had
broken
faith
with
you
i
think
were
i
in
your
place
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
story
for
me
and
now
you
know
more
than
that
you
know
that
she
is
another
man
wife
if
you
find
her
nothing
can
come
of
it
it
is
the
man
i
want
to
find
john
the
man
whom
i
shall
make
it
the
business
of
my
life
to
discover
for
what
good
for
the
deadliest
harm
to
him
gilbert
answered
moodily
if
ever
he
and
i
meet
i
will
have
some
payment
for
my
broken
life
some
compensation
for
my
ruined
hopes
we
two
should
not
meet
and
part
lightly
rely
upon
it
you
can
make
no
excuse
for
his
love
that
fatal
irresistible
passion
which
outweighs
truth
and
honour
when
they
are
set
in
the
opposite
scale
i
did
not
think
you
could
be
so
hard
gilbert
i
thought
you
would
have
more
mercy
on
the
man
who
wronged
you
i
could
pardon
any
injury
but
this
i
will
never
forgive
this
john
saltram
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
deprecating
air
it
is
a
mistake
my
dear
fellow
he
said
life
is
not
long
enough
for
these
strong
passions
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
worth
the
price
these
bitter
hatreds
and
stormy
angers
cost
us
you
have
thrown
away
a
great
deal
of
deep
feeling
on
a
lady
whose
misfortune
it
was
not
to
be
able
to
return
your
affection
as
she
might
have
done
as
you
most
fully
deserved
at
her
hands
why
waste
any
further
emotion
in
regrets
that
are
as
useless
as
they
are
foolish
you
may
as
well
ask
me
why
i
exist
gilbert
answered
quietly
regret
for
all
i
have
lost
is
a
part
of
my
life
after
this
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
and
saltram
went
on
to
speak
of
pleasanter
topics
the
two
men
dined
together
and
sat
by
the
fire
afterwards
with
a
bottle
of
claret
between
them
smoking
their
cigars
and
talking
till
late
into
the
night
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
adela
branston
name
could
be
omitted
entirely
from
this
confidential
talk
i
have
seen
nothing
and
heard
very
little
of
her
while
i
have
been
away
john
saltram
said
in
answer
to
a
question
of
gilbert
but
i
called
in
this
afternoon
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
her
at
home
she
wants
me
to
dine
with
her
next
sunday
and
i
half
promised
to
do
so
will
you
come
too
i
know
that
she
would
be
glad
to
see
you
i
can
not
see
that
i
am
wanted
john
but
i
tell
you
that
you
are
wanted
i
wish
you
to
go
with
me
branston
likes
you
amazingly
if
you
care
to
know
the
opinion
of
so
frivolous
a
person
i
am
very
much
flattered
by
branston
kindly
estimate
of
me
but
i
do
not
think
i
have
any
claim
to
it
except
the
fact
that
i
am
your
friend
i
shall
be
happy
to
go
with
you
on
sunday
if
you
really
wish
it
i
do
really
wish
it
i
shall
drop
branston
a
line
to
say
you
will
come
she
asked
me
to
bring
you
whenever
i
had
an
opportunity
the
is
seven
i
call
for
you
here
a
few
minutes
before
i
do
promise
you
a
very
lively
evening
remember
there
will
only
be
adela
and
a
lady
she
has
taken
as
her
companion
i
do
care
about
lively
evenings
i
have
been
nowhere
in
society
since
i
returned
from
melbourne
i
have
done
with
all
that
kind
of
thing
my
dear
gilbert
that
sort
of
renunciation
will
never
do
john
saltram
said
earnestly
a
man
can
not
turn
his
back
upon
society
at
your
age
life
lies
all
before
you
and
it
rests
with
yourself
to
create
a
happy
future
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
yes
john
and
what
is
left
for
the
living
when
that
burial
is
over
i
do
want
to
make
myself
obnoxious
by
whining
over
my
troubles
but
they
are
not
to
be
lessened
by
philosophy
and
i
can
do
nothing
but
bear
them
as
best
i
may
i
had
long
been
growing
tired
of
society
in
the
conventional
acceptation
of
the
word
and
all
the
stereotyped
pleasures
of
a
commercial
man
life
those
things
are
less
than
nothing
when
a
man
has
nothing
brighter
and
fairer
beyond
them
no
inner
life
by
which
the
common
things
of
this
world
are
made
precious
it
is
only
dropping
out
of
the
arena
a
little
earlier
than
i
might
have
done
otherwise
i
have
a
notion
that
i
shall
wind
up
my
affairs
next
year
sell
my
business
and
go
abroad
i
could
manage
to
retire
upon
a
very
decent
income
in
spite
of
my
losses
the
other
day
do
dream
of
that
gilbert
for
heaven
sake
do
dream
of
anything
so
mad
as
that
what
would
a
man
of
your
age
be
without
some
kind
of
career
a
mere
purposeless
wanderer
on
the
face
of
the
earth
stick
to
business
dear
old
fellow
believe
me
there
is
nothing
like
work
to
make
a
man
forget
any
foolish
trouble
of
this
kind
and
you
will
forget
it
gilbert
be
assured
of
that
if
i
were
not
certain
it
would
be
so
i
should
he
stopped
suddenly
staring
absently
at
the
fire
with
a
darkening
brow
you
would
do
what
john
hate
this
man
holbrook
almost
as
savagely
as
you
hate
him
for
having
come
between
you
and
your
happiness
yet
if
marian
nowell
did
not
love
you
as
a
wife
should
love
her
husband
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
it
was
ten
thousand
times
better
that
the
knot
should
be
cut
in
time
however
roughly
think
what
your
misery
would
have
been
if
you
had
discovered
after
your
marriage
that
her
heart
had
never
been
really
yours
i
can
not
imagine
that
possible
i
have
no
shadow
of
doubt
that
i
should
have
succeeded
in
winning
her
heart
if
this
man
had
not
robbed
me
of
her
my
absence
gave
him
his
opportunity
had
i
been
at
hand
to
protect
my
own
interests
i
do
not
think
his
influence
could
have
prevailed
against
me
it
is
quite
natural
that
you
should
think
that
john
saltram
said
gravely
yet
you
may
be
mistaken
a
woman
love
is
such
a
capricious
thing
and
so
often
bestowed
upon
the
least
deserving
amongst
those
who
seek
it
after
this
they
were
silent
for
some
time
and
then
gilbert
told
his
friend
about
his
acquaintance
with
jacob
nowell
and
the
old
man
futile
endeavours
to
find
his
grandchild
to
all
of
which
saltram
listened
attentively
then
you
fancy
there
is
a
good
bit
of
money
in
question
he
said
when
gilbert
told
him
everything
i
fancy
so
but
i
have
no
actual
ground
for
the
belief
the
place
in
which
the
old
man
lives
is
poor
enough
and
he
has
carefully
abstained
from
any
hint
as
to
what
he
might
leave
his
granddaughter
whatever
it
is
marian
ought
to
have
it
and
there
is
very
little
chance
of
that
unless
she
comes
forward
in
response
to
nowell
advertisements
it
is
a
pity
she
should
lose
the
chance
of
this
inheritance
certainly
said
saltram
and
then
the
conversation
changed
and
they
talked
of
other
subjects
until
it
was
time
for
them
to
part
john
saltram
walked
back
to
the
temple
in
a
very
sombre
mood
meditating
upon
his
friend
trouble
poor
old
gilbert
he
said
to
himself
this
business
has
touched
him
more
deeply
than
i
could
have
thought
possible
i
wish
things
had
happened
otherwise
what
is
it
lady
macbeth
says
had
spent
when
our
desire
is
got
without
content
i
wonder
whether
the
fulfilment
of
one
heart
desire
ever
does
bring
perfect
contentment
i
think
not
there
is
always
something
wanting
and
if
a
man
comes
by
his
wish
basely
there
is
a
taint
of
poison
in
the
wine
of
life
that
neutralizes
all
its
sweetness
chapter
xiii
pallinson
has
views
at
seven
on
sunday
evening
as
the
neighbouring
church
bells
were
just
sounding
their
last
peal
fenton
found
himself
on
the
threshold
of
branston
house
in
it
was
rather
a
gloomy
mansion
pervaded
throughout
with
evidences
of
its
late
owner
oriental
career
old
indian
cabinets
ponderous
chairs
of
ebony
clumsy
in
form
and
barbaric
in
design
curious
old
china
and
lacquered
ware
of
every
kind
from
gigantic
vases
to
the
tiniest
cups
and
saucers
ivory
temples
and
gods
in
silver
and
clay
crowded
the
and
the
broad
landings
on
the
staircase
the
curtains
and
were
of
indian
embroidery
the
carpets
of
oriental
manufacture
everything
had
a
gaudy
aspect
branston
received
her
guests
in
the
back
a
smaller
and
somewhat
snugger
apartment
than
the
spacious
chamber
in
front
which
was
dimly
visible
in
the
light
of
a
single
moderator
lamp
and
the
red
glow
of
a
fire
through
the
archway
between
the
two
rooms
in
the
inner
room
the
lamps
were
brighter
and
the
fire
burned
cheerily
and
here
branston
had
established
for
herself
a
comfortable
nook
in
a
deep
very
low
and
capacious
sheltered
luxuriously
from
possible
draughts
by
a
high
japanese
screen
the
fair
adela
was
a
chilly
personage
and
liked
to
bask
in
her
before
the
fire
she
looked
very
pretty
this
evening
in
her
dense
black
dress
with
the
airiest
pretence
of
a
widow
cap
perched
on
her
rich
auburn
hair
and
a
voluminous
indian
shawl
of
vivid
scarlet
making
a
drapery
about
her
shoulders
she
was
evidently
very
pleased
to
see
john
saltram
and
gave
a
cordial
welcome
to
his
friend
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
there
was
a
tall
rather
lady
also
in
mourning
and
with
an
elaborate
headdress
of
bugles
and
ornaments
of
a
feathery
and
beady
nature
which
were
supposed
to
be
flowers
about
her
neck
this
lady
wore
numerous
rows
of
jet
beads
from
which
depended
crosses
and
lockets
of
the
same
material
she
had
jet
earrings
and
jet
bracelets
and
had
altogether
a
beaded
and
bugled
appearance
which
would
have
been
eminently
fascinating
to
the
untutored
taste
of
a
north
american
indian
this
lady
was
pallinson
a
widow
of
limited
means
and
a
distant
relation
of
adela
branston
left
quite
alone
after
her
death
and
feeling
herself
thoroughly
helpless
adela
had
summoned
this
experienced
matron
to
her
aid
whereupon
pallinson
had
given
up
a
small
establishment
in
the
far
north
of
london
which
she
was
in
the
habit
of
speaking
about
on
occasions
as
her
humble
dwelling
and
had
taken
up
her
quarters
in
where
she
was
a
power
of
dread
to
the
servants
gilbert
fancied
that
pallinson
was
by
no
means
too
favourably
disposed
towards
john
saltram
she
had
sharp
black
eyes
very
much
like
the
jet
beads
with
which
her
person
was
decorated
and
with
these
she
kept
a
close
watch
upon
branston
and
saltram
when
the
two
were
talking
together
gilbert
saw
how
great
an
effort
it
cost
her
at
these
times
to
keep
up
the
commonplace
conversation
which
he
had
commenced
with
her
and
how
intently
she
was
trying
to
listen
to
the
talk
upon
the
other
side
of
the
the
dinner
was
an
admirable
one
the
wines
perfection
branston
having
been
a
of
the
art
of
good
living
and
having
stocked
his
cellars
with
a
view
to
a
much
longer
life
than
had
been
granted
to
him
the
attendance
was
careful
and
complete
the
with
its
rather
furniture
and
heavy
crimson
hangings
a
picture
of
comfort
and
branston
a
most
charming
hostess
even
gilbert
was
fain
to
forget
his
own
troubles
and
enjoy
life
a
little
in
that
agreeable
society
the
two
gentlemen
accompanied
the
ladies
back
to
the
there
was
a
grand
piano
in
the
front
room
and
to
this
adela
branston
went
at
saltram
request
and
began
to
play
some
of
handel
oratorio
music
while
he
stood
beside
the
piano
talking
to
her
as
she
played
pallinson
and
gilbert
were
thus
left
alone
in
the
back
room
and
the
lady
did
her
best
to
improve
the
occasion
by
extorting
what
information
she
could
from
fenton
about
his
friend
adela
tells
me
that
you
and
saltram
are
friends
of
very
long
standing
fenton
she
began
fanning
herself
slowly
with
a
shining
black
fan
as
she
sat
opposite
gilbert
awful
of
aspect
in
the
sombre
splendour
of
her
beads
and
bugles
yes
we
were
at
oxford
together
and
have
been
fast
friends
ever
since
indeed
how
really
delightful
the
young
men
of
the
present
day
appear
to
me
generally
so
incapable
of
a
sincere
friendship
and
you
and
saltram
have
been
friends
all
that
time
he
is
a
literary
man
i
understand
i
have
not
had
the
pleasure
of
reading
any
of
his
works
but
adela
tells
me
he
is
extremely
clever
he
is
very
clever
and
steady
i
hope
literary
men
are
so
apt
to
be
wild
and
dissipated
and
adela
has
such
a
high
opinion
of
your
friend
i
hope
he
is
steady
i
scarcely
know
what
a
lady
notion
of
steadiness
may
involve
gilbert
answered
smiling
but
i
daresay
when
my
friend
marries
he
will
be
steady
enough
i
can
not
see
that
literary
tastes
and
dissipated
habits
have
any
natural
affinity
i
should
rather
imagine
that
a
man
with
resources
of
that
kind
would
be
likely
to
lead
a
quieter
life
than
a
man
without
such
resources
do
you
really
think
so
i
fancied
that
artists
and
poets
and
people
of
that
kind
were
altogether
a
dangerous
class
and
you
think
that
saltram
will
be
steady
when
he
is
married
he
is
engaged
to
be
married
i
conclude
by
your
manner
of
saying
that
i
had
no
idea
my
words
implied
anything
of
the
kind
no
do
not
think
john
saltram
is
engaged
pallinson
glanced
towards
the
piano
where
the
two
figures
seemed
very
close
to
each
other
in
the
dim
light
of
the
room
adela
playing
had
been
going
on
in
a
desultory
kind
of
manner
broken
every
now
and
then
by
her
conversation
with
john
saltram
and
had
evidently
been
intended
to
give
pleasure
only
to
that
one
listener
while
she
was
still
playing
in
this
careless
fitful
way
a
servant
announced
pallinson
and
a
gentleman
entered
whom
gilbert
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
as
the
son
of
the
lady
he
had
been
conversing
with
this
was
a
tall
young
man
with
intensely
penetrating
black
eyes
exactly
like
his
mother
sharp
features
and
an
extreme
precision
of
dress
and
manner
his
hands
which
were
small
and
thin
were
remarkable
for
their
whiteness
and
were
by
spotless
wristbands
which
it
was
his
habit
to
smooth
fondly
with
his
slim
fingers
in
the
intervals
of
his
discourse
pallinson
rose
and
embraced
this
gentleman
with
stately
affection
my
son
theobald
fenton
she
said
my
son
is
a
medical
practitioner
residing
at
and
it
is
a
pleasure
to
him
to
spend
an
occasional
evening
with
his
cousin
adela
and
myself
whenever
the
exigencies
of
professional
life
leave
me
free
to
enjoy
that
happiness
pallinson
added
in
a
brisk
manner
adela
has
been
giving
you
some
music
i
see
i
heard
one
of
choruses
as
i
came
upstairs
he
went
into
the
front
shook
hands
with
branston
and
established
himself
with
a
permanent
air
beside
the
piano
adela
did
not
seem
particularly
glad
to
see
him
and
john
saltram
who
had
met
him
before
in
received
him
with
supreme
indifference
i
am
blessed
as
i
daresay
you
perceive
fenton
in
my
only
son
pallinson
said
when
the
young
man
had
withdrawn
to
the
adjoining
apartment
it
was
my
misfortune
to
lose
an
admirable
husband
very
early
in
life
and
i
have
been
ever
since
that
loss
wholly
devoted
to
my
son
theobald
my
care
has
been
amply
rewarded
by
his
goodness
he
is
a
most
estimable
and
talented
young
man
and
has
already
attained
an
excellent
position
in
the
medical
profession
you
have
reason
to
be
proud
of
him
gilbert
answered
kindly
i
proud
of
him
fenton
he
is
the
sole
delight
and
chief
object
of
my
life
his
career
up
to
this
hour
has
been
all
that
the
fondest
mother
could
desire
if
i
can
only
see
him
happily
and
advantageously
married
i
shall
have
nothing
left
to
wish
for
indeed
thought
gilbert
then
i
begin
to
perceive
the
reason
of
pallinson
anxiety
about
john
saltram
she
wants
to
secure
branston
handsome
fortune
for
this
son
of
hers
not
much
chance
of
that
i
think
fascinating
as
the
doctor
may
be
plain
john
saltram
stands
to
win
that
prize
they
went
into
the
front
presently
and
heard
pallinson
play
the
hallelujah
chorus
arranged
as
a
duet
with
his
cousin
he
was
a
young
man
who
possessed
several
accomplishments
in
a
small
way
could
sing
a
little
and
play
the
piano
and
guitar
a
little
sketch
a
little
and
was
guilty
of
occasional
effusions
in
the
poetical
line
which
were
the
palest
most
invertebrate
reflections
of
owen
meredith
in
the
and
districts
he
was
accounted
an
acquisition
for
an
evening
party
and
his
dulcet
accents
and
engaging
manners
had
rendered
him
a
favourite
with
the
young
mothers
of
the
neighbourhood
who
believed
implicitly
in
pallinson
gray
powders
when
their
little
ones
digestive
organs
had
been
impaired
by
injudicious
diet
and
confided
in
opinion
as
the
fiat
of
an
inscrutable
power
theobald
pallinson
himself
cherished
a
very
agreeable
opinion
of
his
own
merits
life
seemed
to
him
made
on
purpose
that
theobald
pallinson
should
flourish
and
succeed
therein
he
could
hardly
have
formed
any
idea
of
the
world
except
as
an
arena
for
himself
he
was
not
especially
given
to
metaphysics
but
it
would
not
have
been
very
difficult
for
him
to
believe
that
the
entire
universe
was
an
emanation
from
the
brain
of
theobald
pallinson
a
phenomenal
world
existing
only
in
his
sense
of
sight
and
touch
happy
in
this
opinion
of
himself
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
surgeon
had
any
serious
doubt
of
ultimate
success
with
his
cousin
he
regarded
john
saltram
as
an
interloper
who
had
gained
ground
in
branston
favour
only
by
the
accident
of
his
own
absence
from
the
stage
the
pallinsons
had
not
been
on
visiting
terms
with
adela
during
the
life
of
the
east
indian
merchant
who
had
not
shown
himself
favourably
disposed
to
his
wife
relations
and
by
this
means
saltram
had
enjoyed
advantages
which
theobald
pallinson
told
himself
could
not
have
been
his
had
he
theobald
been
at
hand
to
engage
his
cousin
attention
by
those
superior
qualities
of
mind
and
person
which
must
needs
have
utterly
outshone
the
other
all
that
pallinson
wanted
was
opportunity
and
that
being
now
afforded
him
he
looked
upon
the
happy
issue
of
events
as
a
certainty
and
already
contemplated
the
house
in
the
indian
jars
and
cabinets
the
ivory
chessmen
and
the
inlaid
desks
and
japanese
screens
the
ponderous
plate
and
rare
old
wines
with
a
sense
of
prospective
proprietorship
it
seemed
as
if
john
saltram
had
favoured
this
gentleman
views
by
his
prolonged
absence
from
the
scene
holding
himself
completely
aloof
from
adela
branston
at
a
time
when
had
he
been
inclined
to
press
his
suit
he
might
have
followed
her
up
closely
branston
had
been
not
a
little
wounded
by
this
apparent
neglect
on
the
part
of
one
whom
she
loved
better
than
anything
else
in
the
world
but
she
was
inclined
to
believe
any
thing
rather
than
that
john
saltram
did
not
care
for
her
and
she
had
contrived
to
console
herself
with
the
idea
that
his
avoidance
of
her
had
been
prompted
by
a
delicate
consideration
for
her
reputation
and
a
respect
for
the
early
period
of
her
mourning
in
his
society
she
had
an
air
of
happiness
which
became
her
wonderfully
and
gilbert
fenton
fancied
that
a
man
must
needs
be
hard
and
cold
whose
heart
could
not
be
won
by
so
bright
and
gracious
a
creature
she
spoke
more
than
once
in
a
way
of
saltram
absence
from
london
but
the
deeper
feeling
underneath
the
lightness
of
her
manner
was
very
evident
to
gilbert
i
suppose
you
will
be
running
away
from
town
again
directly
she
said
without
giving
any
one
the
faintest
notice
of
your
intention
i
think
what
charm
it
is
that
you
find
in
country
life
i
have
so
often
heard
you
profess
your
indifference
to
shooting
and
the
ordinary
routine
of
rustic
existence
perhaps
the
secret
is
that
you
fear
your
reputation
as
a
man
of
fashion
would
suffer
were
you
to
be
seen
in
london
at
such
a
barbarous
season
as
this
i
have
never
rejoiced
in
a
reputation
for
fashion
saltram
answered
with
his
quiet
smile
a
smile
that
gave
a
wonderful
brightness
to
his
face
and
i
think
i
like
london
in
the
autumn
better
than
at
any
other
time
one
has
room
to
move
about
i
have
been
in
the
country
of
late
because
i
really
do
appreciate
rural
surroundings
and
have
found
myself
able
to
write
better
in
the
perfect
quiet
of
rural
life
it
is
rather
hard
upon
your
friends
that
you
should
devote
all
your
days
to
literature
and
still
harder
upon
the
reading
public
perhaps
but
my
dear
branston
remember
i
must
write
to
live
adela
gave
a
little
impatient
sigh
she
was
thinking
how
gladly
she
would
have
made
this
man
master
of
her
ample
fortune
wondering
whether
he
would
ever
claim
from
her
the
allegiance
she
was
so
ready
to
give
pallinson
did
his
best
to
engage
his
cousin
attention
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
he
brought
her
her
and
hovered
about
her
while
she
sipped
the
beverage
with
that
graceful
air
of
suppressed
tenderness
which
constant
practice
in
the
of
had
rendered
almost
natural
to
him
but
do
what
he
would
he
could
not
distract
branston
thoughts
and
looks
from
john
saltram
it
was
on
him
that
her
eyes
were
fixed
while
the
accomplished
theobald
was
giving
her
a
lively
account
of
a
concert
at
the
eyre
arms
and
it
was
the
fascination
of
his
presence
which
made
her
answer
at
random
to
her
cousin
questions
about
the
last
volume
of
the
laureate
which
she
had
been
lately
reading
even
pallinson
obtuse
as
he
was
apt
to
be
when
called
upon
to
comprehend
any
fact
derogatory
to
his
own
was
fain
to
confess
to
himself
that
this
evening
efforts
were
futile
and
that
this
stranger
was
the
favourite
for
those
matrimonial
stakes
he
had
entered
himself
to
run
for
he
looked
at
saltram
with
a
critical
eye
many
times
in
the
course
of
the
evening
wondering
what
possible
merit
any
sensible
woman
could
perceive
in
such
a
man
but
then
as
theobald
pallinson
reflected
the
misfortune
is
that
so
few
women
are
sensible
and
it
was
gradually
becoming
evident
to
him
that
michael
branston
widow
was
amongst
the
most
foolish
of
her
sex
pallinson
kept
a
sharp
watch
upon
adela
throughout
the
evening
plunging
into
the
conversation
every
now
and
then
with
a
somewhat
dictatorial
and
infallible
air
and
generally
contriving
to
drag
some
praise
of
theobald
into
her
talk
now
dilating
rapturously
upon
that
fever
case
which
he
had
managed
so
wonderfully
the
other
day
proving
his
judgment
superior
to
that
of
an
eminent
consulting
physician
anon
launching
out
into
laudation
of
his
last
poem
which
had
been
set
to
music
by
a
young
lady
in
and
informing
the
company
of
her
son
artistic
talents
and
his
extraordinary
capacity
as
a
judge
of
pictures
to
these
things
the
surgeon
himself
listened
with
a
deprecating
air
smoothing
his
wristbands
and
caressing
his
slim
white
hands
while
he
playfully
reproved
his
parent
for
her
maternal
weakness
pallinson
held
his
ground
near
his
cousin
chair
till
the
last
moment
while
john
saltram
sat
apart
by
one
of
the
tables
listlessly
turning
over
a
volume
of
engravings
and
only
looking
up
at
long
intervals
to
join
in
the
conversation
he
had
an
absent
weary
look
which
puzzled
gilbert
fenton
who
being
only
a
secondary
personage
in
this
narrow
circle
had
ample
leisure
to
observe
his
friend
the
three
gentlemen
left
at
the
same
time
pallinson
driving
away
in
a
neat
miniature
brougham
after
politely
offering
to
convey
his
guests
to
their
destination
it
was
a
bright
starlight
night
and
gilbert
walked
to
the
temple
with
john
saltram
through
the
quietest
of
the
streets
leading
they
lit
their
cigars
as
they
left
the
square
and
walked
for
some
time
in
a
friendly
companionable
silence
when
they
did
speak
their
talk
was
naturally
of
adela
branston
i
thought
she
was
really
charming
gilbert
said
in
spite
of
that
fellow
efforts
to
absorb
her
attention
it
is
pretty
easy
to
see
how
the
land
lies
in
that
direction
and
if
such
a
rival
were
likely
to
injure
you
you
have
a
very
determined
one
in
mr
pallinson
yes
the
surgeon
has
evidently
fixed
his
hopes
upon
poor
old
michael
branston
money
but
i
do
think
he
will
succeed
you
will
not
allow
him
to
do
so
i
hope
i
do
know
about
that
then
you
really
admire
the
little
woman
gilbert
very
much
as
much
as
i
have
ever
admired
any
woman
except
marian
nowell
ah
your
marian
is
a
star
single
and
alone
in
her
brightness
like
that
planet
up
yonder
but
adela
branston
is
a
good
little
soul
and
will
make
a
charming
wife
gilbert
i
wish
to
heaven
you
would
fall
in
love
with
her
gilbert
fenton
stared
aghast
at
his
companion
as
he
tossed
the
end
of
his
cigar
into
the
gutter
why
john
you
must
be
mad
to
say
such
a
thing
no
it
is
by
no
means
a
mad
notion
i
want
to
see
you
cured
gilbert
i
do
like
you
dear
boy
you
know
as
much
as
it
is
possible
for
a
selfish
worthless
fellow
like
me
to
like
any
man
i
would
give
a
great
deal
to
see
you
happy
and
i
am
sure
that
you
might
be
so
as
adela
husband
i
grant
you
that
i
am
the
favourite
at
present
but
she
is
just
the
sort
of
woman
to
be
won
by
any
man
who
would
really
prove
himself
worthy
of
her
her
liking
for
me
is
a
mere
idle
fancy
which
would
soon
die
out
for
want
of
fuel
you
are
my
superior
in
every
way
younger
handsomer
better
why
should
you
not
go
in
for
this
thing
gil
because
i
have
no
heart
to
give
any
woman
john
and
even
if
i
were
free
i
would
not
give
my
heart
to
a
woman
whose
affection
had
to
be
diverted
from
another
channel
before
it
could
be
bestowed
upon
me
i
ca
imagine
what
has
put
such
a
preposterous
idea
into
your
head
or
why
it
is
that
you
shrink
from
improving
your
own
chances
with
mrs
branston
you
must
not
wonder
at
anything
that
i
do
or
say
gilbert
it
is
my
nature
to
do
strange
things
my
destiny
to
take
the
wrong
turning
in
life
when
shall
i
see
you
again
gilbert
asked
when
they
were
parting
at
the
temple
gates
i
can
scarcely
tell
you
that
i
must
go
back
to
oxford
so
soon
yes
my
work
gets
on
better
down
there
i
will
let
you
know
directly
i
return
to
london
on
this
they
parted
gilbert
considerably
mystified
by
his
conduct
but
not
caring
to
push
his
questions
farther
he
had
his
own
affairs
to
think
of
that
one
business
which
absorbed
almost
the
whole
of
his
thoughts
the
business
of
his
search
for
the
man
who
had
robbed
him
of
his
promised
wife
this
interval
in
which
he
remained
inactive
devoting
himself
to
the
duties
of
his
commercial
life
was
only
a
pause
in
his
labours
he
was
not
the
less
bent
upon
bringing
about
a
meeting
between
himself
and
marian
husband
because
of
this
brief
suspension
of
his
efforts

father
and

while
gilbert
fenton
was
deliberating
what
steps
to
take
next
in
his
quest
of
his
unknown
enemy
a
gentleman
arrived
at
a
small
hotel
near
charing
cross
a
gentleman
who
was
evidently
a
stranger
to
england
and
whose
portmanteaus
and
other
travelling
paraphernalia
bore
the
names
of
new
york
manufacturers
he
was
a
portly
individual
of
middle
age
and
was
still
eminently
handsome
he
dressed
well
lived
expensively
and
had
altogether
a
prosperous
appearance
he
took
care
to
inform
the
landlord
of
the
hotel
that
he
was
not
an
american
but
had
returned
to
the
land
of
his
birth
after
an
absence
of
something
like
fifteen
years
and
after
realizing
a
handsome
fortune
upon
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
he
was
a
very
gracious
and
communicative
person
and
seemed
to
take
life
in
an
easy
agreeable
manner
like
a
man
whose
habit
it
was
to
look
on
the
brighter
side
of
all
things
provided
his
own
comfort
was
secured
norton
percival
was
the
name
on
this
gentleman

and
on
the
card
which
he
gave
to
the
waiter
whom
he
desired
to
look
after
his
letters
after
dining
sumptuously
on
the
evening
of
his
arrival
in
london
this
percival
strolled
out
in
the
autumn
darkness
and
made
his
way
through
the
more
obscure
streets
between
charing
cross
and
the
way
seemed
familiar
enough
to
him
and
he
only
paused
now
and
then
to
take
note
of
some
alteration
in
the
buildings
which
he
had
to
pass
the
last
twenty
years
have
not
made
much
change
in
this
neighbourhood
and
the
traveller
from
new

found
little
to
surprise
him
the
place
looks
just
as
dull
and
dingy
as
it
used
to
look
when
i
was
a
lad
he
said
to
himself
i
daresay
i
shall
find
the
old
court
unchanged
in
all
these
years
but
shall
i
find
the
old
man
alive
i
doubt
that
dead
more
likely
and
his
money
gone
to
strangers
i
wonder
whether
he
had
much
money
or
whether
he
was
really
as
poor
as
he
made
himself
out
it
difficult
to
say
i
know
i
made
him
bleed
pretty
freely
at
one
time
and
another
before
he
turned
rusty
and
it
just
possible
i
may
have
had
pretty
nearly
all
he
had
to
give
he
was
in
by
this
time
looking
at
the
shops
where
brokers
ware
of
more
or
less
value
old
oak
carvings
doubtful
pictures
and
rusted
armour
loomed
duskily
upon
the
at
the
corner
of
queen
anne
court
he
paused
and
peered
curiously
into
the
narrow
alley
the
court
is
still
here
at
any
rate
he
muttered
to
himself
and
i
shall
soon
settle
the
other
question
his
heart
beat
faster
than
it
was
wont
to
beat
as
he
drew
near
his
destination
was
it
any
touch
of
real
feeling
or
only
selfish
apprehension
that
quickened
its
throbbing
the
man
life
had
been
so
utterly
reckless
of
others
that
it
would
be
dangerous
to
give
him
credit
for
any
affectionate
yearning
any
natural
remorseful
pang
in
such
a
moment
as
this
he
had
lived
for
self
and
self
alone
and
his
own
interests
were
involved
in
the
issue
of
a
few
steps
brought
him
before
jacob
nowell
window
yes
it
was
just
as
he
remembered
it
twenty
years
before
the
same
dingy
old
silver
the
same
little
heap
of
gold
the
same
tray
of
tarnished
jewelry
glimmered
in
the
faint
light
of
a
solitary
behind
the
murky
glass
on
the
there
was
still
jacob
nowell
name
yet
all
this
might
mean
nothing
the
grave
might
have
closed
over
the
old
silversmith
and
the
interest
of
trade
necessitate
the
preservation
of
the
familiar
name
the
gentleman
calling
himself
percival
went
into
the
shop
how
well
he
remembered
the
sharp
jangling
sound
of
the
bell
and
how
intensely
he
had
hated
it
and
all
the
surroundings
of
his
father
sordid
life
in
the
days
when
he
was
pursuing
his
headlong
career
as
a
fine
gentleman
and
only
coming
to
queen
anne
court
for
money
he
remembered
what
an
incubus
the
shop
had
been
upon
him
what
a
pursuing
phantom
and
perpetual
image
of
his
degradation
in
the
days
of
his
university
life
when
he
was
incessantly
haunted
by
the
dread
that
his
father
social
status
would
be
discovered
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
brought
back
all
the
old
feelings
and
he
was
young
again
a
nervous
supplicant
for
money
which
was
likely
to
be
refused
to
him
the
sharp
peal
of
the
bell
produced
luke
tulliver
who
emerged
from
a
little
den
in
a
corner
at
the
back
of
the
shop
where
he
had
been
engaged
copying
items
into
a
by
the
light
of
a
solitary
the
stranger
looked
like
a
customer
and
tulliver
received
him
graciously
turning
up
the
gas
over
the
counter
which
had
been
burning
at
a
diminished
and
economical
rate
hitherto
did
you
wish
to
look
at
anything
in
antique
silver
sir
he
asked
briskly
we
have
some
very
handsome
specimens
of
the
queen
anne
period
no
i
do
want
to
look
at
anything
i
want
to
know
whether
jacob
nowell
is
still
living
yes
sir
nowell
is
my
master
you
might
have
noticed
his
name
upon
the
if
you
had
looked
do
you
wish
to
see
him
i
do
tell
him
that
i
am
an
old
friend
just
come
from
america
luke
tulliver
went
into
the
parlour
behind
the
door
norton
percival
following
upon
him
closely
he
heard
the
old
man
voice
saying
i
have
no
friend
in
america
but
you
may
tell
the
person
to
come
in
i
will
see
him
the
voice
trembled
a
little
and
the
silversmith
had
raised
himself
from
his
chair
and
was
looking
eagerly
towards
the
door
as
norton
percival
entered
not
caring
to
wait
for
any
more
formal
invitation
the
two
men
faced
each
other
silently
in
the
dim
light
from
one
candle
on
the
mantelpiece
jacob
nowell
looking
intently
at
the
bearded
face
of
his
visitor
you
can
go
tulliver
he
said
sharply
to
the
shopman
i
wish
to
be
alone
with
this
gentleman
luke
tulliver
departed
with
his
usual
reluctant
air
closing
the
door
as
slowly
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
close
it
and
staring
at
the
stranger
till
the
last
moment
that
it
was
possible
for
him
to
stare
when
he
was
gone
the
old
man
took
the
candle
from
the
mantelpiece
and
held
it
up
before
the
bearded
face
of
the
traveller
yes
yes
yes
he
said
slowly
at
last
it
is
you
percival
my
only
son
i
thought
you
were
dead
long
ago
i
had
a
right
to
consider
you
dead
if
i
had
thought
my
existence
could
be
a
matter
of
interest
to
you
i
should
hardly
have
so
long
refrained
from
all
communication
with
you
but
your
letters
led
me
to
suppose
you
utterly
indifferent
to
my
fate
i
offered
you
and
your
wife
a
home
yes
but
on
conditions
that
were
impossible
to
me
i
had
some
pride
in
those
days
my
education
had
not
fitted
me
to
stand
behind
a
counter
and
drive
hard
bargains
with
dealers
of
doubtful
honesty
nor
could
i
bring
my
wife
to
such
a
home
as
this
the
time
came
when
you
left
that
poor
creature
without
any
home
said
the
old
man
sternly
necessity
has
no
law
my
dear
father
you
may
imagine
that
my
life
without
a
profession
and
without
any
reliable
resources
has
been
rather
precarious
when
i
seemed
to
have
acted
worst
i
have
been
only
the
slave
of
circumstances
indeed
and
have
you
no
pity
for
the
fate
of
your
wife
no
interest
in
the
life
of
your
only
child
my
wife
was
a
poor
helpless
creature
who
contrived
to
make
my
life
wretched
nowell
alias
percival
answered
coolly
i
gave
her
every
sixpence
i
possessed
when
i
sent
her
home
to
england
but
luck
went
dead
against
me
for
a
long
time
after
that
and
i
could
neither
send
her
money
nor
go
to
her
when
i
heard
of
her
death
i
heard
in
an
indirect
way
that
my
child
had
been
adopted
by
some
old
fool
of
a
officer
and
i
was
naturally
glad
of
an
accident
which
relieved
me
of
a
heavy
incubus
an
opportunity
occurred
about
the
same
time
of
my
entering
on
a
tolerably
remunerative
career
as
agent
for
some
belgian
ironworks
in
america
and
i
had
no
option
but
to
close
with
the
offer
at
once
or
lose
the
chance
altogether
i
sailed
for
new
york
within
a
fortnight
after
poor
death
and
have
lived
in
america
for
the
last
fifteen
years
i
have
contrived
to
establish
a
tolerably
flourishing
trade
there
on
my
own
account
a
trade
that
only
needs
capital
to
become
one
of
the
first
in
new
york
capital
echoed
jacob
nowell
i
thought
there
was
something
wanted
it
would
have
been
a
foolish
fancy
to
suppose
that
affection
could
have
had
anything
to
do
with
your
coming
to
me
my
dear
father
it
is
surely
possible
that
affection
and
interest
may
sometimes
go
together
were
i
a
pauper
i
would
not
venture
to
present
myself
before
you
at
all
but
as
a
tolerably
prosperous
trader
with
the
ability
to
propose
an
alliance
that
should
be
to
our
mutual
advantage
i
considered
i
might
fairly
approach
you
i
have
no
money
to
invest
in
your
trade
the
old
man
answered
sternly
i
am
a
very
poor
man
impoverished
for
life
by
the
wicked
extravagance
of
your
youth
if
you
have
come
to
me
with
any
hope
of
obtaining
money
from
me
you
have
wasted
time
and
trouble
let
that
subject
drop
then
percival
nowell
said
lightly
i
suppose
you
have
some
remnant
of
regard
for
me
in
spite
of
our
old
misunderstanding
and
that
my
coming
is
not
quite
indifferent
to
you
no
the
other
answered
with
a
touch
of
melancholy
it
is
not
indifferent
to
me
i
have
waited
for
your
return
these
many
years
you
might
have
found
me
more
tenderly
disposed
towards
you
had
you
come
earlier
but
there
are
some
feelings
which
seem
to
wear
out
as
a
man
grows
older
affections
that
grow
paler
day
by
day
like
colours
fading
in
the
sun
still
i
am
glad
to
see
you
once
more
before
i
die
you
are
my
only
son
and
you
must
needs
be
something
nearer
to
me
than
the
rest
of
the
world
in
spite
of
all
that
i
have
suffered
at
your
hands
i
could
not
come
back
to
england
sooner
than
this
the
young
man
said
presently
i
had
a
hard
battle
to
fight
out
yonder
there
had
been
very
little
appearance
of
emotion
upon
either
side
so
far
percival
nowell
took
things
as
coolly
as
it
was
his
habit
to
take
everything
while
his
father
carefully
concealed
whatever
deeper
feeling
might
be
stirred
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
by
this
unexpected
return
you
do
not
ask
any
questions
about
the
fate
of
your
only
child
the
old
man
said
my
dear
father
that
is
of
course
a
subject
of
lively
interest
to
me
but
i
did
not
suppose
that
you
could
be
in
a
position
to
give
me
any
information
upon
that
point
i
do
happen
to
know
something
about
your
daughter
but
not
much
jacob
nowell
went
on
to
tell
his
son
all
that
he
had
heard
from
gilbert
fenton
respecting
marian
marriage
of
his
own
advertisements
and
wasted
endeavours
to
find
her
he
said
nothing
and
this
fellow
whom
she
has
jilted
is
pretty
well
off
i
suppose
percival
said
thoughtfully
he
is
an
australian
merchant
and
i
should
imagine
in
prosperous
circumstances
foolish
girl
and
this
holbrook
is
no
doubt
an
adventurer
or
he
would
scarcely
have
married
her
in
such
a
secret
way
have
you
any
wish
that
she
should
be
found
yes
i
have
a
fancy
for
seeing
her
before
i
die
she
is
my
own
flesh
and
blood
like
you
and
has
not
injured
me
as
you
have
i
should
like
to
see
her
and
if
she
happened
to
take
your
fancy
you
would
leave
her
all
your
money
i
suppose
who
told
you
that
i
have
money
to
leave
cried
the
old
man
sharply
have
i
not
said
that
i
am
a
poor
man
hopelessly
impoverished
by
your
extravagance
bah
my
dear
father
that
is
all
nonsense
my
extravagance
is
a
question
of
nearly
twenty
years
ago
if
i
had
swamped
all
you
possessed
in
those
days
which
i
do
for
a
moment
believe
you
have
had
ample
time
to
make
a
fresh
fortune
since
then
you
would
never
have
lived
all
those
years
in
queen
anne
court
except
for
the
sake
of
why
the
place
stinks
of
money
i
know
your
tricks
buying
silver
from
men
who
are
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
sell
it
to
be
particular
about
the
price
lending
money
at
sixty
per
cent
a
sixty
which
comes
to
eighty
before
the
transaction
is
finished
a
man
does
not
lead
such
a
life
as
yours
for
nothing
you
are
rolling
in
money
and
you
mean
to
punish
me
by
leaving
it
all
to
marian
the
silversmith
grew
pale
with
anger
during
this
speech
of
his
son
you
are
a
consummate
scoundrel
he
said
and
are
at
liberty
to
think
what
you
please
i
tell
you
once
for
all
i
am
as
poor
as
job
but
if
i
had
a
million
i
would
not
give
you
a
sixpence
of
it
so
be
it
the
other
answered
gaily
i
have
not
performed
the
duties
of
a
parent
very
punctually
hitherto
but
i
do
mind
taking
some
trouble
to
find
this
girl
while
i
am
in
england
in
order
that
she
may
not
lose
her
chances
with
you
you
need
give
yourself
no
trouble
on
that
score
fenton
has
promised
to
find
her
for
me
indeed
i
should
like
to
see
this
mr
fenton
you
can
see
him
if
you
please
but
you
are
scarcely
likely
to
get
a
warm
reception
in
that
quarter
fenton
knows
what
you
have
been
to
your
daughter
and
to
me
i
am
not
going
to
fling
myself
into
his
arms
i
only
want
to
hear
all
he
can
tell
me
about
marian
how
long
do
you
mean
to
stay
in
england
that
is
entirely
dependent
upon
the
result
of
my
visit
i
had
hoped
that
if
i
found
you
living
which
i
most
earnestly
desired
might
be
the
case
i
should
find
in
you
a
friend
and
coadjutor
i
am
employed
in
starting
a
great
iron
company
which
is
likely
i
may
say
certain
to
result
in
large
gains
to
all
concerned
in
it
and
i
fancied
i
should
experience
no
difficulty
in
securing
your
there
are
the
prospectuses
of
the
scheme
he
flung
a
heap
of
printed
papers
on
the
table
before
his
father
and
there
is
not
a
line
in
them
that
i
can
not
guarantee
on
my
credit
as
a
man
of
business
you
can
look
over
them
at
your
leisure
or
not
as
you
please
i
think
you
must
know
that
i
always
had
an
independent
spirit
and
would
be
the
last
of
mankind
to
degrade
myself
by
any
servile
attempt
to
alter
your
line
of
conduct
towards
me
independent
spirit
yes
cried
the
old
man
in
a
mocking
tone
a
son
extorts
every
sixpence
he
can
from
his
father
and
mother
ay
percy
from
his
weak
loving
mother
i
know
who
robbed
me
to
send
you
money
and
then
when
he
can
extort
no
more
boasts
of
his
independence
but
that
will
do
there
is
no
need
that
we
should
quarrel
after
twenty
years
severance
we
can
afford
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
i
have
told
you
that
i
am
glad
to
see
you
if
you
come
to
me
with
disinterested
feelings
that
is
enough
you
may
take
back
your
prospectuses
i
have
nothing
to
embark
in
yankee
speculations
if
your
scheme
is
a
good
one
you
will
find
plenty
of
enterprising
spirits
willing
to
join
you
if
it
is
a
bad
one
i
daresay
you
will
contrive
to
find
dupes
you
can
come
and
see
me
again
when
you
please
and
now
i
find
this
kind
of
talk
rather
tiring
at
my
age
one
word
before
i
leave
you
said
percival
on
reflection
i
think
it
will
be
as
well
to
say
nothing
about
my
presence
in
england
to
this
fenton
i
shall
be
more
free
to
hunt
for
marian
without
his
even
supposing
he
were
inclined
to
give
it
you
have
told
me
all
that
he
could
tell
me
i
daresay
i
believe
i
have
precisely
therefore
no
possible
good
could
come
of
an
encounter
between
him
and
me
and
i
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
keep
my
name
dark
as
you
please
though
i
can
see
no
reason
for
secrecy
in
the
matter
it
is
not
a
question
of
secrecy
but
only
of
prudential
reserve
it
may
be
as
you
wish
answered
the
old
man
carelessly
he
shook
hands
with
his
son
who
departed
without
having
broken
bread
in
his
father
house
a
little
dashed
by
the
coldness
of
his
reception
but
not
entirely
without
hope
that
some
profit
might
arise
to
him
out
of
this
connection
in
the
future
the
girl
must
be
found
he
said
to
himself
i
am
convinced
there
has
been
a
great
fortune
made
in
that
dingy
hole
better
that
it
should
go
to
her
than
to
a
stranger
i
very
sorry
she
married
but
if
this
holbrook
is
the
adventurer
i
suppose
him
the
marriage
may
come
to
nothing
yes
i
must
find
her
a
father
returned
from
foreign
lands
is
rather
a
romantic
notion
the
sort
of
notion
a
girl
is
pretty
sure
to
take
kindly
to
chapter
xv
on
the
track
gilbert
fenton
saw
no
more
of
his
friend
john
saltram
after
that
sunday
evening
which
they
had
spent
together
in
he
called
upon
branston
before
the
week
was
ended
and
was
so
fortunate
as
to
find
that
lady
alone
pallinson
having
gone
on
a
shopping
expedition
in
her
kinswoman
dashing
brougham
the
pretty
little
widow
received
gilbert
very
graciously
but
there
was
a
slight
shade
of
melancholy
in
her
manner
a
pensiveness
which
softened
and
refined
her
gilbert
thought
nor
was
it
long
before
she
allowed
him
to
discover
the
cause
of
her
sadness
after
a
little
conventional
talk
upon
indifferent
subjects
she
began
to
speak
of
john
saltram
have
you
seen
much
of
your
friend
saltram
since
sunday
she
asked
with
that
vain
endeavour
to
speak
carelessly
with
which
a
woman
generally
betrays
her
real
feeling
i
have
not
seen
him
at
all
since
sunday
he
told
me
he
was
going
back
to
oxford
or
the
neighbourhood
of
oxford
i
believe
almost
immediately
and
i
have
not
troubled
myself
to
hunt
him
up
at
his
chambers
gone
back
already
branston
exclaimed
with
a
disappointed
petulant
look
that
was
i
can
not
imagine
what
charm
he
finds
in
a
dull
village
on
the
banks
of
the
river
he
has
confessed
that
the
place
is
the
dreariest
and
most
obscure
in
the
world
and
that
he
has
neither
shooting
nor
any
other
kind
of
amusement
there
must
be
some
mysterious
attraction
fenton
i
think
your
friend
is
a
good
deal
changed
of
late
have
you
found
him
so
no
branston
i
can
not
say
that
i
have
discovered
any
marked
alteration
in
him
since
my
return
from
australia
john
saltram
was
always
wayward
and
fitful
he
may
have
been
a
little
more
so
lately
perhaps
but
that
is
all
you
have
a
very
high
opinion
of
him
i
suppose
he
is
very
dear
to
me
we
were
something
more
than
friends
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
word
do
you
remember
the
story
of
those
two
noble
young
venetians
who
inscribed
upon
their
shield
non
amici
saltram
and
i
have
been
brothers
rather
than
friends
and
you
think
him
a
good
man
adela
asked
anxiously
most
decidedly
i
have
reason
to
think
so
i
believe
him
to
be
a
and
honourable
man
a
little
neglectful
or
disdainful
of
conventionalities
wearing
his
faith
in
god
and
his
more
sacred
feelings
anywhere
than
upon
his
sleeve
but
a
man
who
can
not
fail
to
come
right
in
the
i
am
so
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
i
have
known
saltram
some
time
as
you
may
have
heard
and
like
him
very
much
but
my
cousin
pallinson
has
quite
an
aversion
to
him
and
speaks
against
him
with
such
a
positive
air
at
times
that
i
have
been
almost
inclined
to
think
she
must
be
right
i
am
very
inexperienced
in
the
ways
of
the
world
and
am
naturally
disposed
to
lean
a
little
upon
the
opinions
of
others
but
do
you
think
there
may
be
a
reason
for
pallinson
dislike
of
my
friend
adela
branston
blushed
at
this
question
and
then
laughed
a
little
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
she
said
yes
it
is
just
possible
that
pallinson
may
be
jealously
disposed
towards
any
acquaintance
of
mine
on
account
of
that
paragon
of
perfection
her
son
theobald
i
have
not
been
so
blind
as
not
to
see
her
views
in
that
quarter
but
be
assured
fenton
that
whatever
may
happen
to
me
i
shall
never
become
theobald
pallinson
i
hope
not
i
am
quite
ready
to
acknowledge
pallinson
merits
and
accomplishments
but
i
do
not
think
him
worthy
of
you
it
is
rather
awful
is
it
for
me
to
speak
of
marriage
at
all
within
a
few
months
of
my
husband
death
but
when
a
woman
has
money
people
will
not
allow
her
to
forget
that
she
is
a
widow
for
ever
so
short
a
time
but
it
is
quite
a
question
if
i
shall
ever
marry
again
i
have
very
little
doubt
that
real
happiness
is
most
likely
to
be
found
in
a
wise
avoidance
of
all
the
perils
and
perplexities
of
that
foolish
passion
which
we
read
of
in
novels
if
one
could
only
be
wise
do
you
think
so
mr
fenton
my
own
experience
inclines
me
to
agree
with
you
branston
gilbert
answered
smiling
at
the
little
woman
naïveté
your
own
experience
has
been
unfortunate
then
i
wish
i
were
worthy
of
your
confidence
saltram
told
me
some
time
ago
that
you
were
engaged
to
a
very
charming
young
lady
the
young
lady
in
question
has
jilted
me
indeed
and
you
are
very
angry
with
her
of
course
i
loved
her
too
well
to
be
angry
with
her
i
reserve
my
indignation
for
the
scoundrel
who
stole
her
from
me
it
is
very
generous
of
you
to
make
excuses
for
the
lady
branston
said
and
would
fain
have
talked
longer
of
this
subject
but
gilbert
concluded
his
visit
at
this
juncture
not
caring
to
discuss
his
troubles
with
the
sympathetic
widow
he
left
the
great
gloomy
gorgeous
house
in
cavendish
square
more
than
ever
convinced
of
adela
branston
affection
for
his
friend
more
than
ever
puzzled
by
john
saltram
indifference
to
so
advantageous
an
alliance
within
a
few
days
of
this
visit
gilbert
fenton
left
london
he
had
devoted
himself
unflinchingly
to
his
business
since
his
return
to
england
and
had
so
planned
and
organized
his
affairs
as
to
be
able
now
to
absent
himself
for
some
little
time
from
the
city
he
was
going
upon
what
most
men
would
have
called
a
fool
errand
his
quest
of
husband
but
he
was
going
with
a
steady
purpose
in
his
breast
a
determination
never
to
abandon
the
search
till
it
should
result
in
success
he
might
have
to
suspend
it
from
time
to
time
should
he
determine
to
continue
his
commercial
career
but
the
purpose
would
be
nevertheless
the
ruling
influence
of
his
life
he
had
but
one
clue
for
his
guidance
in
setting
out
upon
this
voyage
of
discovery
miss
long
had
told
him
that
the
couple
were
to
go
to
some
in
hampshire
which
had
been
lent
to
holbrook
by
a
friend
it
was
in
hampshire
therefore
that
gilbert
resolved
to
make
his
first
inquiries
he
told
himself
that
success
was
merely
a
question
of
time
and
patience
the
business
of
tracing
these
people
who
were
not
to
be
found
by
any
public
inquiry
would
be
slow
and
wearisome
no
doubt
he
was
prepared
for
that
he
was
prepared
for
a
thousand
failures
and
disappointments
before
he
alighted
on
the
one
place
in
which
holbrook
name
must
needs
be
known
the
town
or
village
nearest
to
the
that
had
been
lent
to
him
and
even
if
after
trouble
and
perseverance
on
his
part
he
should
find
the
place
he
wanted
it
was
quite
possible
that
marian
and
her
husband
would
have
gone
elsewhere
and
his
quest
would
have
to
begin
afresh
but
he
fancied
that
he
could
hardly
fail
to
obtain
some
information
as
to
their
plan
of
life
if
he
could
find
the
place
where
they
had
stayed
after
their
marriage
his
own
scheme
of
action
was
simple
enough
he
had
only
to
travel
from
place
to
place
making
careful
inquiries
at
and
in
all
likely
quarters
at
every
stage
of
his
journey
he
went
straight
to
winchester
having
a
fancy
for
the
quiet
old
city
and
the
fair
pastoral
scenery
surrounding
it
and
thinking
that
holbrook
borrowed
retreat
might
possibly
be
in
this
neighbourhood
the
business
proved
even
slower
and
more
tedious
than
he
had
supposed
there
were
so
many
farms
round
about
winchester
so
many
places
which
seemed
likely
enough
and
to
which
he
went
only
to
find
that
no
person
of
the
name
of
holbrook
had
ever
been
heard
of
by
the
inhabitants
he
made
his
in
the
cathedral
city
for
nearly
a
week
and
explored
the
country
round
in
a
radius
of
thirty
miles
without
the
faintest
success
it
was
fine
autumn
weather
calm
and
clear
the
foliage
still
upon
the
trees
in
all
its
glory
of
gold
and
brown
with
patches
of
green
lingering
here
and
there
in
sheltered
places
the
country
was
very
beautiful
and
gilbert
fenton
work
would
have
been
pleasant
enough
if
the
elements
of
peace
had
been
in
his
breast
but
they
were
not
bitter
regrets
for
all
he
had
lost
uneasy
fears
and
wild
imaginings
about
the
fate
of
her
whom
he
still
loved
with
a
fond
useless
passion
these
and
other
gloomy
thoughts
haunted
him
day
by
day
clouding
the
calm
loveliness
of
the
scenes
on
which
he
looked
until
all
outer
things
seemed
to
take
their
colour
from
his
own
mind
he
had
loved
marian
nowell
as
it
is
not
given
to
many
men
to
love
and
with
the
loss
of
her
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
very
springs
of
his
life
were
broken
all
the
machinery
of
his
existence
was
loosened
and
out
of
gear
and
he
could
scarcely
have
borne
the
dreary
burden
of
his
days
had
it
not
been
for
that
one
feverish
hope
of
finding
the
man
who
had
wronged
him
the
week
ended
without
bringing
him
in
the
smallest
degree
nearer
the
chance
of
success
happily
for
himself
he
had
not
expected
to
succeed
in
a
week
on
leaving
winchester
he
started
on
a
kind
of
vagabond
tour
through
the
county
on
a
horse
which
he
hired
in
the
cathedral
city
and
which
carried
him
from
twenty
to
thirty
miles
a
day
this
mode
of
travelling
enabled
him
to
explore
obscure
villages
and
places
that
lay
off
the
line
of
railway
everywhere
he
made
the
same
inquiries
everywhere
with
the
same
result
another
week
came
to
an
end
he
had
made
his
voyage
of
discovery
through
more
than
half
of
the
county
as
his
told
him
and
was
still
no
nearer
success
than
when
he
left
london
he
spent
his
sunday
at
a
comfortable
inn
in
a
quiet
little
town
where
there
was
a
curious
old
church
and
a
fine
peal
of
bells
that
seemed
to
him
to
be
ringing
all
day
long
it
was
a
dull
rainy
day
he
went
to
church
in
the
morning
and
in
the
afternoon
stood
at
the
window
watching
the
townspeople
going
by
to
their
devotions
in
an
absent
unseeing
way
and
thinking
of
his
own
troubles
pausing
just
a
little
now
and
then
from
that
egotistical
brooding
to
wonder
how
these
people
endured
the
dull
monotonous
round
of
their
lives
and
what
crosses
and
disappointments
they
had
to
suffer
in
their
small
obscure
way
the
inn
was
very
empty
and
the
landlord
waited
upon
fenton
in
person
at
his
dinner
gilbert
had
the
all
to
himself
and
it
looked
comfortable
enough
when
the
curtains
were
drawn
the
lamps
lighted
and
the
small
wheeled
in
front
of
a
blazing
fire
i
have
been
thinking
over
what
you
were
asking
me
last
night
sir
the
host
of
the
white
swan
began
while
gilbert
was
eating
his
fish
and
though
i
ca
say
that
i
ever
heard
the
name
of
holbrook
i
fancy
i
may
have
seen
the
lady
and
gentleman
you
are
looking
for
indeed
exclaimed
gilbert
eagerly
pushing
away
his
plate
and
turning
full
on
the
landlord
i
hope
you
wo
let
me
spoil
your
dinner
sir
i
know
that
fresh
i
a
pretty
good
judge
of
those
things
and
choose
every
bit
of
fish
that
cooked
in
this
house
but
as
i
was
saying
sir
with
regard
to
this
lady
and
gentleman
i
think
you
said
that
the
people
you
are
looking
for
were
strangers
to
this
part
of
the
country
and
were
occupying
a
that
had
been
lent
to
them
precisely
well
sir
i
remember
some
time
in
the
early
part
of
the
year
i
think
it
must
have
been
about
march
yes
the
people
i
am
looking
for
would
have
arrived
in
march
indeed
sir
that
makes
it
seem
likely
i
remember
a
lady
and
gentleman
coming
here
from
the
railway
station
we
got
a
station
close
by
our
town
as
you
know
sir
i
daresay
they
wanted
a
fly
to
take
them
and
their
luggage
on
somewhere
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
remember
the
name
of
the
place
but
it
was
a
drive
and
it
was
a
farm
i
could
swear
to
something
farm
if
it
had
been
a
place
i
known
i
think
i
should
have
remembered
the
name
can
i
see
the
man
who
drove
them
gilbert
asked
quickly
the
young
man
that
drove
them
sir
has
left
me
and
has
left
these
parts
a
month
come
next
tuesday
where
he
has
gone
is
more
than
i
can
tell
you
he
was
very
good
with
horses
but
he
turned
out
badly
cheated
me
up
hill
and
down
dale
as
you
may
say
though
what
hills
and
dales
have
got
to
do
with
it
is
more
than
i
can
tell
and
i
was
obliged
to
get
rid
of
him
that
provoking
but
if
the
people
i
want
are
anywhere
within
ten
miles
of
this
place
i
do
suppose
i
should
be
long
finding
them
yet
the
mere
fact
of
two
strangers
coming
here
and
going
on
to
some
place
called
a
farm
seems
very
slight
ground
to
go
upon
the
month
certainly
corresponds
with
the
time
at
which
and
holbrook
came
to
hampshire
did
you
take
any
particular
notice
of
them
i
took
particular
notice
of
the
lady
she
was
as
pretty
a
woman
as
ever
i
set
eyes
upon
quite
a
girl
i
noticed
that
the
gentleman
was
very
careful
and
tender
with
her
when
he
put
her
into
the
carriage
wrapping
her
up
and
so
on
he
looked
a
good
deal
older
than
her
and
i
much
like
his
looks
altogether
could
you
describe
him
well
no
sir
the
time
was
short
and
he
was
wrapped
up
a
good
deal
the
collar
of
his
overcoat
turned
up
and
a
scarf
round
his
neck
he
had
dark
eyes
i
remember
and
rather
a
stern
look
in
them
this
was
rather
too
vague
a
description
to
make
any
impression
upon
gilbert
it
was
something
certainly
to
know
that
his
rival
had
dark
eyes
if
indeed
this
man
of
whom
the
landlord
spoke
really
were
his
rival
he
had
never
been
able
to
make
any
mental
picture
of
the
stranger
who
had
come
between
him
and
his
betrothed
he
had
been
inclined
to
fancy
that
the
man
must
needs
be
much
handsomer
than
himself
possessed
of
every
outward
attribute
calculated
to
subjugate
the
mind
of
an
inexperienced
girl
like
marian
but
the
at
wygrove
and
miss
long
had
both
spoken
in
a
disparaging
tone
of
holbrook
personal
appearance
and
remembering
this
he
was
fain
to
believe
that
marian
had
been
won
by
some
charm
more
subtle
than
that
of
a
handsome
face
he
went
on
eating
his
dinner
in
silence
for
some
little
time
meditating
upon
what
the
landlord
had
told
him
then
as
the
man
cleared
the
table
lingering
over
his
work
as
if
eager
to
impart
any
stray
scraps
of
information
he
might
possess
gilbert
spoke
to
him
again
i
should
have
fancied
that
as
a
settled
inhabitant
of
the
place
you
would
be
likely
to
know
every
farm
and
within
ten
miles
or
within
twenty
miles
he
said
well
sir
i
daresay
i
do
know
the
neighbourhood
pretty
well
in
a
general
way
but
i
think
if
i
known
the
name
of
the
place
this
lady
and
gentleman
were
going
to
it
would
have
struck
me
more
than
it
did
and
i
should
have
remembered
it
i
was
uncommonly
busy
through
that
afternoon
for
it
was
and
there
were
a
mort
of
people
going
in
and
out
i
never
did
interfere
much
with
the
fly
business
it
was
only
by
taking
the
gentleman
out
some
that
i
came
to
take
the
notice
i
did
of
the
lady
looks
and
his
care
of
her
i
know
it
was
a
drive
and
that
i
told
the
gentleman
the
fare
so
as
there
might
be
no
bother
between
him
and
william
tyler
my
man
at
the
end
and
he
agreed
to
it
in
a
liberal
kind
of
way
like
a
man
who
care
much
for
money
as
to
farms
within
ten
miles
of
here
there
are
a
dozen
at
least
one
way
and
another
some
small
and
some
large
do
you
know
of
any
place
in
the
ownership
of
a
gentleman
who
would
be
likely
to
lend
his
house
to
a
friend
i
ca
say
i
do
sir
they
about
here
mostly
and
rather
a
roughish
lot
as
you
may
say
there
a
place
over
beyond
crosber
ten
miles
off
and
more
i
do
know
the
name
of
it
or
the
person
it
belongs
to
but
i
noticed
it
many
a
time
as
i
driven
by
a
curious
house
standing
back
off
one
of
the
lanes
out
of
crosber
with
a
large
garden
before
it
a
queer
lonesome
place
altogether
i
should
take
it
to
be
two
or
three
hundred
years
old
and
i
should
think
the
house
had
had
money
spent
upon
it
within
the
memory
of
man
it
a
dilapidated
tumbledown
old
gazabo
of
a
place
and
yet
there
a
kind
of
prettiness
about
it
in
when
the
garden
is
full
of
flowers
there
a
river
runs
through
some
of
the
land
about
half
a
mile
from
the
house
what
kind
of
a
place
is
crosber
a
bit
of
a
village
on
the
road
from
here
to
portsmouth
the
house
telling
you
about
is
a
mile
from
crosber
at
the
least
away
from
the
main
road
there
two
or
three
lanes
or
about
there
and
it
lies
in
one
of
them
that
turns
sharp
off
by
the
blue
boar
which
is
about
the
only
inn
where
you
can
bait
a
horse
thereabouts
i
ride
over
there
morning
and
have
a
look
at
this
queer
old
house
you
might
give
me
the
names
of
any
other
farms
you
know
about
this
neighbourhood
and
their
occupants
this
the
landlord
was
very
ready
to
do
he
ran
over
the
names
of
from
ten
to
fifteen
places
which
gilbert
jotted
down
upon
a
leaf
of
his
afterwards
planning
his
route
upon
the
map
of
the
county
which
he
carried
for
his
guidance
he
set
out
early
the
next
morning
under
a
low
gray
sky
with
clouds
in
the
distance
that
threatened
rain
the
road
from
the
little
to
crosber
possessed
no
especial
beauty
the
country
was
flat
and
uninteresting
about
here
and
needed
the
glory
of
its
summer
verdure
to
brighten
and
embellish
it
but
fenton
did
not
give
much
thought
to
the
scenes
through
which
he
went
at
this
time
the
world
around
and
about
him
was
all
of
one
colour
the
sunless
gray
which
pervaded
his
own
life
the
low
dull
sky
and
the
threatening
clouds
far
away
upon
the
level
horizon
harmonised
well
with
his
own
thoughts
with
the
utter
hopelessness
of
his
mind
hopelessness
yes
that
was
the
word
he
had
hazarded
all
upon
this
one
chance
and
its
failure
was
the
shipwreck
of
his
life
the
ruin
was
complete
he
could
not
build
up
a
new
scheme
of
happiness
in
the
full
maturity
of
his
manhood
his
fate
had
come
to
him
he
was
not
the
kind
of
man
who
can
survive
the
ruin
of
his
plans
and
begin
afresh
with
other
hopes
and
still
fairer
dreams
it
was
his
nature
to
be
constant
in
all
his
life
he
had
chosen
for
himself
only
one
friend
in
all
his
life
he
had
loved
but
one
woman
he
came
to
the
little
village
with
its
low
cottages
whose
upper
stories
abutted
upon
the
road
and
overshadowed
the
casements
below
and
where
here
and
there
a
few
pennyworths
of
gingerbread
that
seemed
mouldy
with
the
mould
of
ages
a
glass
of
or
and
half
a
dozen
penny
bottles
of
ink
indicated
the
commercial
tendencies
of
crosber
a
little
farther
on
he
came
to
a
with
a
steep
thatched
roof
overgrown
by
stonecrop
and
other
parasites
which
was
evidently
the
shop
of
the
village
inasmuch
as
one
side
of
the
window
exhibited
a
show
of
homely
drapery
while
the
other
side
was
devoted
to
groceries
and
a
shelf
above
laden
with
great
sprawling
loaves
of
bread
this
establishment
was
also
the
and
here
gilbert
resolved
to
make
his
customary
inquiries
when
he
had
put
up
his
horse
almost
immediately
opposite
this
general
emporium
the
sign
of
the
blue
boar
swung
proudly
across
the
street
in
front
of
a
low
rather
hostelry
with
a
wide
frontage
and
an
archway
leading
into
a
spacious
desolate
yard
where
one
gloomy
cock
of
spanish
descent
was
crowing
hoarsely
on
the
broken
roof
of
a
shed
surrounded
by
four
or
five
hens
all
in
the
most
wobegone
stage
of
moulting
and
appearing
as
if
eggs
were
utterly
remote
from
their
intentions
this
blue
boar
was
popularly
supposed
to
have
been
a
most
distinguished
and
prosperous
place
in
the
coaching
days
when
twenty
coaches
passed
daily
through
the
village
of
crosber
and
was
even
now
much
affected
as
a
place
of
resort
by
the
villagers
to
the
sore
vexation
of
the
rector
and
such
good
people
as
believed
in
the
perfectibility
of
the
human
race
and
the
ultimate
suppression
of
here
fenton
dismounted
and
surrendered
his
horse
to
the
keeping
of
an
unkempt
bareheaded
youth
who
emerged
from
one
of
the
buildings
in
the
yard
announced
himself
as
the
hostler
and
led
off
the
steed
in
triumph
to
a
wilderness
of
a
stable
where
the
landlord
pony
and
a
fine
colony
of
rats
were
luxuriating
in
the
space
designed
for
some
twelve
or
fifteen
horses
having
done
this
gilbert
crossed
the
road
to
the
where
he
found
the
proprietor
a
deaf
old
man
weighing
of
sugar
in
the
background
while
a
brisk
girl
stood
behind
the
counter
sorting
a
little
packet
of
letters
it
was
to
the
damsel
as
the
more
intelligent
of
these
two
that
gilbert
addressed
himself
beginning
of
course
with
the
usual
question
did
she
know
any
one
a
stranger
sojourning
in
that
neighbourhood
called
holbrook
the
girl
shook
her
head
without
a
moment
hesitation
no
she
knew
no
one
of
that
name
and
i
suppose
all
the
letters
for
people
in
this
neighbourhood
pass
through
your
hands
yes
sir
all
of
them
i
could
have
failed
to
notice
if
there
had
been
any
one
of
that
name
gilbert
gave
a
little
weary
sigh
the
information
given
him
by
the
landlord
of
the
white
swan
had
seemed
to
bring
him
so
very
near
the
object
of
his
search
and
here
he
was
thrown
back
all
at
once
upon
the
wide
field
of
conjecture
not
a
whit
nearer
any
certain
knowledge
it
was
true
that
crosber
was
only
one
among
several
places
within
ten
miles
of
the
and
the
strangers
who
had
been
driven
from
the
white
swan
in
march
last
might
have
gone
to
any
one
of
those
other
localities
his
inquiries
were
not
finished
yet
however
there
is
an
old
house
about
a
mile
from
here
he
said
to
the
girl
a
house
belonging
to
a
farm
in
the
lane
yonder
that
turns
off
by
the
blue
boar
have
you
any
notion
to
whom
it
belongs
or
who
lives
there
an
old
house
in
that
lane
across
the
way
the
girl
said
reflecting
that
golder
lane
and
leads
to
there
not
many
houses
there
it
rather
a
lonesome
kind
of
place
do
you
mean
a
big
house
standing
far
back
in
a
garden
yes
that
must
be
the
place
i
want
to
know
about
it
must
be
the
grange
surely
it
was
a
gentleman
house
once
but
there
only
a
bailiff
lives
there
now
the
farm
belongs
to
some
gentleman
down
in
midlandshire
a
baronet
i
ca
call
to
mind
his
name
at
this
moment
though
i
have
heard
it
often
enough
daughter
carley
is
the
name
of
the
bailiff
at
the
grange
comes
here
for
all
they
want
gilbert
gave
a
little
start
at
the
name
of
midlandshire
lidford
was
in
midlandshire
was
it
not
likely
to
be
a
midlandshire
man
who
had
lent
marian
husband
his
house
do
you
know
if
these
people
at
the
grange
have
had
any
one
staying
with
them
lately
any
lodgers
he
asked
the
girl
yes
they
have
lodgers
pretty
well
every
summer
there
were
some
people
this
year
a
lady
and
gentleman
but
they
never
seemed
to
have
any
letters
and
i
ca
tell
you
their
names
are
they
living
there
still
i
ca
tell
you
that
i
used
to
see
them
at
church
now
and
then
in
the
but
i
have
seen
them
lately
there
a
church
at
almost
as
near
and
they
may
have
been
there
will
you
tell
me
what
they
were
like
gilbert
asked
eagerly
his
heart
was
beating
loud
and
fast
making
a
painful
tumult
in
his
breast
he
felt
assured
that
he
was
on
the
track
of
the
people
whom
the
innkeeper
had
described
to
him
the
people
who
were
in
all
probability
and
holbrook
the
lady
is
very
pretty
and
very
young
quite
a
girl
the
gentleman
older
dark
and
not
handsome
yes
has
the
lady
gray
eyes
and
hair
and
a
very
bright
expressive
face
yes
sir
pray
try
to
remember
the
name
of
the
gentleman
to
whom
the
grange
belongs
it
is
of
great
importance
to
me
to
know
that
i
ask
my
father
sir
the
girl
answered
he
pretty
sure
to
know
she
went
across
the
shop
to
the
old
man
who
was
weighing
sugar
and
bawled
her
question
into
his
ear
he
scratched
his
head
in
a
meditative
way
for
some
moments
i
heard
the
name
times
and
often
he
said
though
i
never
set
eyes
upon
the
gentleman
william
carley
has
been
bailiff
at
the
grange
these
twenty
years
and
i
do
believe
as
the
owner
has
ever
come
nigh
the
place
in
all
that
time
let
me
see
it
a
common
name
enough
though
the
gentleman
is
a
baronight
forster
that
it
sir
something
forster
sir
david
cried
gilbert
you
hit
it
sir
sir
david
forster
that
the
gentleman
sir
david
forster
he
had
little
doubt
after
this
that
the
strangers
at
the
grange
had
been
marian
and
her
husband
treachery
blackest
treachery
somewhere
he
had
questioned
sir
david
and
had
received
his
positive
assurance
that
this
man
holbrook
was
unknown
to
him
and
now
against
that
there
was
the
fact
that
the
baronet
was
the
owner
of
a
place
in
hampshire
to
be
taken
in
conjunction
with
that
other
fact
that
a
place
in
hampshire
had
been
lent
to
holbrook
by
a
friend
at
the
very
first
he
had
been
inclined
to
believe
that
marian
lover
must
needs
be
one
of
the
worthless
bachelor
crew
with
which
the
baronet
was
accustomed
to
surround
himself
he
had
only
abandoned
that
notion
after
his
interview
with
sir
david
forster
and
now
it
seemed
that
the
baronet
had
deliberately
lied
to
him
it
was
of
course
just
possible
that
he
was
on
a
false
scent
after
all
and
that
it
was
to
some
other
part
of
the
country
holbrook
had
brought
his
bride
but
such
a
coincidence
seemed
at
the
least
highly
improbable
there
was
no
occasion
for
him
to
remain
in
doubt
very
long
however
at
the
grange
he
must
needs
be
able
to
obtain
more
definite
information

gilbert
fenton
left
the
homely
little
and
turned
into
the
lane
leading
to
a
way
which
may
have
been
pleasant
enough
in
summer
but
had
no
especial
charm
at
this
time
the
level
expanse
of
bare
ploughed
fields
on
each
side
of
the
narrow
road
had
a
dreary
look
the
hedges
were
low
and
thin
a
tall
elm
with
all
its
lower
limbs
mercilessly
shorn
uplifted
its
topmost
branches
to
the
dull
gray
sky
here
and
there
like
some
transformed
prophetess
raising
her
gaunt
arms
in
appeal
or
malediction
an
occasional
gate
marked
the
entrance
to
some
to
the
farm
on
one
side
of
the
way
a
deep
ditch
lay
under
the
scanty
shelter
of
the
low
hedge
and
hinted
at
possible
water
rats
to
the
traveller
from
cities
who
might
happen
to
entertain
a
fastidious
aversion
to
such
small
deer
the
mile
seemed
a
very
long
one
to
gilbert
fenton
since
his
knowledge
of
sir
david
forster
ownership
of
the
house
to
which
he
was
going
his
impatience
was
redoubled
he
had
a
feverish
eagerness
to
come
at
the
bottom
of
this
mystery
that
sir
david
had
lied
to
him
he
had
very
little
doubt
whoever
this
holbrook
was
it
was
more
likely
that
he
should
have
escaped
the
notice
of
lidford
people
as
a
guest
at
heatherly
than
under
any
other
circumstances
at
heatherly
it
was
such
a
common
thing
for
strangers
to
come
and
go
that
even
the
rustic
gossips
had
left
off
taking
much
interest
in
the
movements
of
the
baronet
or
his
guests
there
was
one
thought
that
flashed
suddenly
into
gilbert
mind
during
that
gloomy
walk
under
the
lowering
gray
sky
if
this
man
holbrook
were
indeed
a
friend
of
sir
david
forster
how
did
it
happen
that
john
saltram
had
failed
to
recognize
his
name
the
intimacy
between
forster
and
saltram
was
of
such
old
standing
that
it
seemed
scarcely
likely
that
any
acquaintance
of
sir
david
could
be
completely
unknown
to
the
other
were
they
all
united
in
treachery
against
him
had
his
chosen
friend
the
man
he
loved
so
well
been
able
to
enlighten
him
and
had
he
coldly
withheld
his
knowledge
no
he
told
himself
that
was
not
possible
sir
david
forster
might
be
the
falsest
most
unprincipled
of
mankind
but
he
could
not
believe
john
saltram
capable
of
baseness
or
even
coldness
towards
him
he
was
at
the
end
of
his
journey
by
this
time
the
grange
stood
in
front
of
him
a
great
rambling
building
with
many
gables
gray
walls
and
quaint
old
casements
in
the
upper
stories
below
the
windows
were
larger
and
had
an
elizabethan
look
with
patches
of
stained
glass
here
and
there
the
house
stood
back
from
the
road
with
a
spacious
garden
before
it
a
garden
with
of
a
dutch
design
sheltered
from
adverse
winds
by
dense
hedges
of
yew
and
holly
a
pleasant
old
garden
enough
one
could
fancy
in
summer
weather
the
were
for
the
most
part
empty
now
and
the
only
flowers
to
be
seen
were
pale
chrysanthemums
and
michaelmas
daises
the
garden
was
surrounded
by
a
high
wall
and
gilbert
contemplated
it
first
through
the
rusty
of
a
tall
iron
gate
surmounted
by
the
arms
and
monogram
of
the
original
owner
on
one
side
of
the
house
there
was
a
vast
pile
of
building
comprising
stables
and
barns
and
granaries
arranged
in
a
quadrangle
the
gate
leading
into
this
quadrangle
was
open
and
gilbert
saw
the
cattle
standing
in
a
he
rang
a
bell
which
had
a
hoarse
rusty
sound
as
if
it
had
not
been
rung
very
often
of
late
and
after
he
had
waited
for
some
minutes
and
rung
a
second
time
a
woman
emerged
from
the
house
and
came
slowly
along
the
wide
towards
him
she
stared
at
him
with
the
broad
open
stare
of
rusticity
and
did
not
make
any
attempt
to
open
the
gate
but
stood
with
a
great
key
in
her
hand
waiting
for
gilbert
to
speak
this
is
sir
david
forster
house
i
believe
he
said
yes
sir
it
be
but
sir
david
does
live
here
i
know
that
you
have
some
lodgers
here
a
lady
and
gentleman
called
holbrook
he
plunged
at
once
at
this
assertion
as
the
easiest
way
of
arriving
at
the
truth
he
had
a
conviction
that
this
solitary
was
the
place
to
which
his
unknown
rival
had
brought
marian
yes
sir
the
woman
answered
still
staring
at
him
in
her
slow
stupid
way
holbrook
is
here
but
holbrook
is
away
up
in
london
did
you
wish
to
see
the
lady
gilbert
heart
gave
a
great
throb
she
was
here
close
to
him
in
the
next
minute
he
would
be
face
to
face
with
her
with
that
one
woman
whom
he
loved
and
must
continue
to
love
until
the
end
of
his
life
yes
he
said
eagerly
i
wish
to
see
her
you
can
take
me
to
her
at
once
i
am
an
old
friend
there
is
no
occasion
to
carry
in
my
name
he
had
scarcely
thought
of
seeing
marian
until
this
moment
it
was
her
husband
he
had
come
to
seek
it
was
with
him
that
his
reckoning
was
to
be
made
and
any
meeting
between
marian
and
himself
was
more
likely
to
prove
a
hindrance
to
this
reckoning
than
otherwise
but
the
temptation
to
seize
the
chance
of
seeing
her
again
was
too
much
for
him
whatever
hazard
there
might
be
to
his
scheme
of
vengeance
in
such
an
encounter
slipped
out
of
his
mind
before
the
thought
of
looking
once
more
at
that
idolised
face
of
hearing
the
loved
voice
once
again
the
woman
hesitated
for
a
few
moments
telling
gilbert
that
holbrook
never
had
visitors
and
she
did
not
know
whether
she
would
like
to
see
him
but
on
his
administering
through
the
of
the
gate
she
put
the
key
in
the
lock
and
admitted
him
he
followed
her
along
the
path
to
a
wide
wooden
porch
over
which
the
ivy
hung
like
a
voluminous
curtain
and
through
a
door
into
a
low
roomy
hall
with
massive
dark
across
the
ceiling
and
a
broad
staircase
of
ecclesiastical
aspect
leading
to
a
gallery
above
the
house
had
evidently
been
a
place
of
considerable
grandeur
and
importance
in
days
gone
by
but
everything
in
it
bore
traces
of
neglect
and
decay
the
hall
was
dark
and
cold
the
wide
empty
the
iron
dogs
red
with
rust
some
sacks
of
grain
were
stored
in
one
corner
a
rough
carpenter
bench
stood
under
one
of
the
mullioned
windows
and
some
were
spread
out
to
dry
in
another
the
woman
opened
a
low
door
at
the
end
of
this
hall
and
ushered
gilbert
into
a
with
three
windows
looking
out
upon
a
dutch
a
quadrangle
of
smooth
turf
shut
in
by
tall
hedges
of
holly
the
room
was
empty
and
the
visitor
had
ample
leisure
to
examine
it
while
the
woman
went
to
seek
holbrook
it
was
a
large
room
with
a
low
ceiling
and
a
capacious
where
a
rather
scanty
fire
was
burning
in
a
dull
slow
way
the
furniture
was
old
and
furniture
that
had
once
been
handsome
and
was
of
a
ponderous
fashion
that
defied
time
there
was
a
massive
oaken
cabinet
on
one
side
of
the
room
a
bureau
with
brass
handles
on
the
other
a
comfortable
looking
sofa
of
an
antiquated
design
with
cushions
had
been
wheeled
near
the
and
close
beside
it
there
was
a
small
table
with
an
open
desk
upon
it
and
some
papers
scattered
loosely
about
there
were
a
few
autumn
flowers
in
a
homely
vase
upon
the
centre
table
and
a
with
some
slippers
in
berlin
wool
work
unfinished
gilbert
fenton
contemplated
all
these
things
with
supreme
tenderness
it
was
here
that
marian
had
lived
for
so
many
months
alone
most
likely
for
the
greater
part
of
the
time
he
had
a
fixed
idea
that
the
man
who
had
stolen
his
treasure
was
some
dissipated
worldling
altogether
unworthy
so
sacred
a
trust
the
room
had
a
look
of
loneliness
to
him
he
could
fancy
the
long
solitary
hours
in
this
remote
seclusion
he
had
to
wait
for
some
little
time
walking
slowly
up
and
down
very
eager
for
the
interview
that
was
to
come
yet
with
a
consciousness
that
his
fate
would
seem
only
so
much
the
darker
to
him
afterwards
when
he
had
to
turn
his
back
upon
this
place
with
perhaps
no
hope
of
ever
seeing
marian
again
at
last
there
came
a
light
footfall
the
door
was
opened
and
his
lost
love
came
into
the
room
gilbert
fenton
was
standing
near
the
with
his
back
to
the
light
for
the
first
few
moments
it
was
evident
that
marian
did
not
recognize
him
she
came
towards
him
slowly
with
a
wondering
look
in
her
face
and
then
stopped
suddenly
with
a
faint
cry
of
surprise
you
here
she
exclaimed
o
how
did
you
find
this
place
why
did
you
come
she
clasped
her
hands
looking
at
him
in
a
way
that
went
straight
to
his
heart
what
he
had
told
branston
was
quite
true
it
was
not
in
him
to
be
angry
with
this
girl
whatever
bitterness
there
might
have
been
in
his
mind
until
this
moment
fled
away
at
sight
of
her
his
heart
had
no
room
for
any
feeling
but
tenderness
and
pity
did
you
imagine
that
i
should
rest
until
i
had
seen
you
once
more
marian
did
you
suppose
i
should
submit
to
lose
you
without
hearing
from
your
own
lips
why
i
have
been
so
unfortunate
i
did
not
think
you
would
waste
time
or
thought
upon
any
one
so
wicked
as
i
have
been
towards
you
she
answered
slowly
standing
before
him
with
a
pale
sad
face
and
downcast
eyes
i
fancied
that
whatever
love
you
had
ever
felt
for
me
and
i
know
how
well
you
did
love
me
would
perish
in
a
moment
when
you
found
how
basely
i
had
acted
i
hoped
that
it
would
be
so
no
marian
love
like
mine
does
not
perish
so
easily
as
that
o
my
love
my
love
why
did
you
forsake
me
so
cruelly
what
had
i
done
to
merit
your
desertion
of
me
what
had
you
done
you
had
only
been
too
good
to
me
i
know
that
there
is
no
excuse
for
my
sin
i
have
prayed
that
you
and
i
might
never
meet
again
what
can
i
say
from
first
to
last
i
have
been
wrong
from
first
to
last
i
have
acted
weakly
and
wickedly
i
was
flattered
and
gratified
by
your
affection
for
me
and
when
i
found
that
my
dear
uncle
had
set
his
heart
upon
our
marriage
i
yielded
against
my
own
better
reason
which
warned
me
that
i
did
not
love
you
as
you
deserved
to
be
loved
then
for
a
long
time
i
was
blind
to
the
truth
i
did
not
examine
my
own
heart
i
was
quite
able
to
estimate
all
your
noble
qualities
and
i
fancied
that
i
should
be
very
happy
as
your
wife
but
you
must
remember
that
at
the
last
when
you
were
leaving
england
i
asked
you
to
release
me
and
told
you
that
it
would
be
happier
for
both
of
us
to
be
free
why
was
that
marian
because
at
that
last
moment
i
began
to
doubt
my
own
heart
had
there
been
any
other
influence
at
work
marian
had
you
seen
your
husband
holbrook
at
that
time
she
blushed
crimson
and
the
slender
hands
nervously
clasped
and
unclasped
themselves
before
she
spoke
i
can
not
answer
that
question
she
said
at
last
that
is
quite
as
good
as
saying
you
had
seen
this
man
he
had
come
between
us
already
o
marian
marian
why
were
you
not
more
candid
because
i
was
weak
and
foolish
i
could
not
bear
to
make
you
unhappy
o
believe
me
gilbert
i
had
no
thought
of
falsehood
at
that
time
i
fully
meant
to
be
true
to
my
promise
come
what
might
i
am
quite
willing
to
believe
that
he
answered
gently
i
believe
that
you
acted
from
first
to
last
under
the
influence
of
a
stronger
will
than
your
own
you
can
see
that
i
feel
no
resentment
against
you
i
come
to
you
in
sorrow
not
in
anger
but
i
want
to
understand
how
this
thing
came
to
pass
why
was
it
that
you
never
wrote
to
me
to
tell
me
the
complete
change
in
your
feelings
it
was
thought
better
not
marian
faltered
after
a
pause
by
you
no
by
my
husband
and
you
suffered
him
to
dictate
to
you
in
that
matter
against
your
own
sense
of
right
i
loved
him
she
answered
simply
i
have
never
refused
to
obey
him
in
anything
i
will
own
that
i
thought
it
would
be
better
to
write
and
tell
you
the
truth
but
my
husband
thought
otherwise
he
wished
our
marriage
to
remain
a
secret
from
you
and
from
all
the
world
for
some
time
to
come
he
had
his
own
reasons
for
that
reasons
i
was
bound
to
respect
i
can
not
think
how
you
came
to
discover
this
place
i
have
taken
some
trouble
to
find
you
marian
and
it
is
a
hard
thing
to
find
you
the
wife
of
another
but
the
bitterness
of
it
must
be
borne
i
do
not
want
to
reproach
you
when
i
tell
you
that
my
life
has
been
broken
utterly
by
this
blow
i
want
you
to
believe
in
my
truth
and
honour
to
trust
me
now
as
you
might
have
trusted
me
when
you
first
discovered
that
you
could
not
love
me
since
i
am
not
to
be
your
husband
let
me
be
the
next
best
thing
your
friend
the
day
may
come
in
which
you
will
have
need
of
an
honest
man
friendship
she
shook
her
head
sadly
you
are
very
good
she
said
but
there
is
no
possibility
of
friendship
between
you
and
me
if
you
will
only
say
that
you
can
forgive
me
for
the
great
wrong
i
have
done
you
there
will
be
a
heavy
burden
lifted
from
my
heart
and
whatever
you
may
think
now
i
can
not
doubt
that
in
the
future
you
will
find
some
one
far
better
worthy
of
your
love
than
ever
i
could
have
been
that
is
the
stereotyped
form
of
consolation
marian
a
man
is
always
referred
to
that
shadowy
and
perfect
creature
who
is
to
appear
in
the
future
and
heal
all
his
wounds
there
will
be
no
such
for
me
i
staked
all
when
i
played
the
great
game
and
have
lost
all
but
why
can
not
i
be
your
friend
marian
can
you
forgive
my
husband
for
his
part
in
the
wrong
that
has
been
done
you
can
you
be
his
friend
knowing
what
he
has
done
no
gilbert
answered
fiercely
between
his
set
teeth
i
can
forgive
your
weakness
but
not
the
man
treachery
then
you
can
never
be
mine
marian
said
firmly
remember
i
am
not
talking
of
a
common
friendship
a
friendship
of
daily
association
i
offer
myself
to
you
as
refuge
in
the
hour
of
trouble
a
counsellor
in
perplexity
a
brother
always
waiting
in
the
background
of
your
life
to
protect
or
serve
you
of
course
it
is
quite
possible
you
may
never
have
need
of
protection
or
service
god
knows
i
wish
you
all
happiness
but
there
are
not
many
lives
quite
free
from
trouble
and
the
day
may
come
in
which
you
will
want
a
friend
if
it
ever
does
i
will
remember
your
goodness
gilbert
looked
scrutinisingly
at
marian
holbrook
as
she
stood
before
him
with
the
cold
gray
light
of
the
sunless
day
full
upon
her
face
he
wanted
to
read
the
story
of
her
life
in
that
beautiful
face
if
it
were
possible
he
wanted
to
know
whether
she
was
happy
with
the
man
who
had
stolen
her
from
him
she
was
very
pale
but
that
might
be
fairly
attributed
to
the
agitation
caused
by
his
presence
gilbert
fancied
that
there
was
a
careworn
look
in
her
face
and
that
her
beauty
had
faded
a
little
since
those
peaceful
days
at
lidford
when
these
two
had
wasted
the
summer
hours
in
idle
talk
under
the
walnut
trees
in
the
captain
garden
she
was
dressed
very
plainly
in
black
there
was
no
coquettish
knot
of
ribbon
at
her
throat
no
girlish
trinkets
dangled
at
her
waist
all
those
little
graces
and
embellishments
of
costume
which
seem
natural
to
a
woman
whose
life
is
happy
were
wanting
in
her
toilet
and
slight
as
these
indications
were
gilbert
did
not
overlook
them
did
he
really
wish
her
to
be
happy
happy
with
the
rival
he
so
fiercely
hated
he
had
said
as
much
and
in
saying
so
he
had
believed
that
he
was
speaking
the
truth
but
he
was
only
human
and
it
is
just
possible
that
tenderly
as
he
still
loved
this
girl
he
may
have
been
hardly
capable
of
taking
pleasure
in
the
thought
of
her
happiness
i
want
you
to
tell
me
about
your
husband
marian
he
said
after
a
pause
who
and
what
he
is
why
should
i
do
that
she
asked
looking
at
him
with
a
steady
almost
defiant
expression
you
have
said
that
you
will
never
forgive
him
what
interest
can
you
possibly
feel
in
his
affairs
i
am
interested
in
him
upon
your
account
i
can
not
tell
you
anything
about
him
i
do
not
know
how
you
could
have
discovered
even
his
name
i
learned
that
at
wygrove
where
i
first
heard
of
your
marriage
did
you
go
to
wygrove
then
yes
i
have
told
you
that
i
spared
no
pains
to
find
you
nor
shall
i
spare
any
pains
to
discover
the
history
of
the
man
who
has
wronged
me
it
would
be
wiser
for
you
to
be
frank
with
me
marian
rely
upon
it
that
i
shall
sooner
or
later
learn
the
secret
underlying
this
treacherous
business
you
profess
to
be
my
friend
and
yet
are
avowedly
say
husband
enemy
why
can
not
you
be
truly
generous
gilbert
and
pardon
him
believe
me
he
was
not
willingly
treacherous
it
was
his
fate
to
do
you
this
wrong
a
poor
excuse
for
a
man
marian
no
my
charity
will
not
stretch
far
enough
for
that
but
i
do
not
come
to
you
quite
on
a
selfish
errand
to
speak
solely
of
my
own
wrongs
i
have
something
to
tell
you
of
real
importance
to
yourself
what
is
that
gilbert
fenton
described
the
result
of
his
first
advertisement
and
his
acquaintance
with
jacob
nowell
it
is
my
impression
that
this
old
man
is
rich
marian
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
he
would
leave
all
he
possesses
to
you
if
you
went
to
him
at
once
i
do
not
care
very
much
about
money
for
my
own
sake
she
answered
with
rather
a
mournful
smile
but
we
are
not
rich
and
i
should
be
glad
of
anything
that
would
improve
my
husband
position
i
should
like
to
see
my
grandfather
i
stand
so
much
alone
in
the
world
that
it
would
be
very
sweet
to
me
to
find
a
near
relation
your
husband
must
surely
have
seen
nowell
advertisement
gilbert
said
after
a
pause
it
was
odd
that
he
did
not
tell
you
about
it
that
he
did
not
wish
you
to
reply
to
it
the
advertisement
may
have
escaped
him
or
he
may
have
looked
upon
it
as
a
trap
to
discover
our
retreat
marian
answered
frankly
i
can
not
understand
the
motive
for
such
secrecy
there
is
no
occasion
that
you
should
understand
it
every
life
has
its
own
mystery
its
peculiar
perplexities
when
i
married
my
husband
i
was
prepared
to
share
all
his
troubles
i
have
been
obedient
to
him
in
everything
and
has
your
marriage
brought
you
happiness
marian
i
love
my
husband
she
answered
with
a
plaintive
reproachful
look
as
if
there
had
been
a
kind
of
cruelty
in
his
straight
question
i
do
not
suppose
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
perfect
happiness
in
the
world
the
answer
was
enough
for
gilbert
fenton
it
told
him
that
this
life
was
not
all
sunshine
he
had
not
the
heart
to
push
his
inquiries
farther
he
felt
that
he
had
no
right
to
remain
any
longer
when
in
all
probability
his
presence
was
a
torture
to
the
girl
who
had
injured
him
i
will
not
prolong
my
visit
marian
he
said
regretfully
it
was
altogether
a
foolish
one
perhaps
but
i
wanted
so
much
to
see
you
once
more
to
hear
some
explanation
of
your
conduct
from
your
own
lips
my
conduct
can
admit
of
neither
explanation
nor
justification
she
replied
humbly
i
know
how
wickedly
i
have
acted
believe
me
gilbert
i
am
quite
conscious
of
my
unworthiness
and
how
little
right
i
have
to
expect
your
forgiveness
it
is
my
weakness
rather
than
my
merit
not
to
be
able
to
cherish
any
angry
feeling
against
you
marian
mine
has
been
a
slavish
kind
of
love
i
suppose
that
sort
of
thing
never
is
successful
women
have
an
instinctive
contempt
for
men
who
love
them
with
such
blind
unreasonable
idolatry
i
do
not
know
how
that
may
be
but
i
know
that
i
have
always
respected
and
esteemed
you
she
answered
in
her
gentle
pleading
way
i
am
grateful
to
you
even
for
so
much
as
that
and
now
i
suppose
i
must
say
rather
a
hard
word
to
say
under
the
circumstances
heaven
knows
when
you
and
i
may
meet
again
wo
you
stop
and
take
some
luncheon
i
dine
early
when
my
husband
is
away
it
saves
trouble
to
the
people
of
the
house
the
bailiff
daughter
always
dines
with
me
when
i
am
alone
but
i
do
suppose
you
will
mind
sitting
down
with
her
she
is
a
good
girl
and
very
fond
of
me
i
would
sit
down
to
dinner
with
a
if
he
were
a
favourite
of
yours
marian
or
holbrook
i
suppose
i
must
call
you
that
now
after
this
they
talked
of
captain
sedgewick
for
a
little
and
the
tears
came
to
marian
eyes
as
she
spoke
of
that
generous
and
faithful
protector
while
they
were
talking
thus
the
door
was
opened
and
a
girl
appeared
carrying
a
tray
she
was
dressed
in
a
simple
pretty
fashion
a
little
above
her
station
as
a
bailiff
daughter
and
had
altogether
rather
a
superior
look
in
spite
of
her
rusticity
gilbert
thought
she
was
quite
at
her
ease
in
his
presence
laying
the
cloth
briskly
and
cleverly
and
chattering
all
the
time
i
am
sure
i
very
glad
any
visitor
should
come
to
see
holbrook
she
said
for
she
has
had
a
sad
lonely
time
of
it
ever
since
she
has
been
here
poor
dear
there
are
not
many
young
married
women
would
put
up
with
such
a
life
nelly
marian
exclaimed
reproachfully
you
know
that
i
have
had
nothing
to
put
up
with
that
i
have
been
quite
happy
here
ah
it
all
very
well
to
say
that
holbrook
but
i
know
better
i
know
how
many
lonely
days
you
spent
so
downhearted
that
you
could
scarcely
speak
or
look
up
from
your
book
and
that
only
an
excuse
for
if
you
a
friend
of
holbrook
you
might
tell
him
as
much
sir
that
he
killing
his
pretty
young
wife
by
inches
by
leaving
her
so
often
alone
in
this
dreary
place
goodness
knows
it
is
that
i
want
to
get
rid
of
her
i
like
her
so
much
that
i
know
what
to
do
with
myself
when
she
gone
but
i
love
her
too
well
not
to
speak
the
truth
when
i
see
a
chance
of
its
getting
to
the
right
ears
i
am
no
friend
of
holbrook
gilbert
answered
but
i
think
you
are
a
good
girl
you
are
a
very
foolish
girl
marian
exclaimed
and
i
am
extremely
angry
with
you
for
talking
such
utter
nonsense
about
me
i
may
have
been
a
little
out
of
spirits
sometimes
in
my
husband
absence
but
that
is
all
i
shall
begin
to
think
that
you
really
do
want
to
get
rid
of
me
nell
say
what
you
will
that
a
pretty
thing
when
you
know
that
i
love
you
as
dearly
as
if
you
were
my
sister
to
say
nothing
of
father
who
makes
a
profit
by
your
being
here
and
would
be
fine
and
angry
with
me
for
interfering
no
holbrook
it
your
own
happiness
i
thinking
of
and
nothing
else
and
i
do
say
that
it
a
shame
for
a
pretty
young
woman
like
you
to
be
shut
up
in
a
lonely
old
while
your
husband
is
away
enjoying
himself
goodness
knows
where
and
when
he
is
here
i
ca
see
that
very
good
company
considering
that
he
spends
the
best
part
of
his
time
the
girl
stopped
abruptly
warned
by
a
look
from
marian
gilbert
saw
this
look
and
wondered
what
revelation
of
holbrook
habits
the
daughter
had
been
upon
the
point
of
making
he
was
so
eager
to
learn
something
of
this
man
and
had
been
so
completely
baffled
in
all
his
endeavours
hitherto
i
will
not
have
my
affairs
talked
about
in
this
foolish
way
ellen
carley
marian
said
resolutely
and
then
they
all
three
sat
down
to
the
the
dishes
were
brought
in
by
the
woman
who
had
admitted
gilbert
the
dinner
was
excellent
after
a
simple
fashion
and
very
nicely
served
but
for
fenton
the
fowl
and
ham
might
as
well
have
been
the
grass
which
the
philosopher
believed
the
french
people
might
learn
to
eat
he
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
the
one
fact
that
he
was
in
society
for
perhaps
the
last
time
in
his
life
he
wondered
at
himself
not
a
little
for
the
weakness
which
made
it
so
sweet
to
him
to
be
with
her
the
moment
came
at
last
in
which
he
must
needs
take
his
leave
having
no
possible
excuse
for
remaining
any
longer
marian
he
said
i
suppose
we
are
never
likely
to
meet
again
one
never
knows
what
may
happen
but
i
think
it
is
far
better
we
should
not
meet
for
many
reasons
what
am
i
to
tell
your
grandfather
when
i
see
him
that
i
will
come
to
him
as
soon
as
i
can
get
my
husband
permission
to
do
so
i
should
not
think
there
would
be
any
difficulty
about
that
when
he
knows
that
this
relationship
is
likely
to
bring
you
fortune
i
daresay
not
and
if
you
come
to
london
to
see
nowell
there
will
be
some
chance
of
our
meeting
again
what
good
can
come
of
that
not
much
to
me
i
daresay
it
would
be
a
desperate
melancholy
kind
of
pleasure
anything
is
better
than
the
idea
of
losing
sight
of
you
for
ever
of
leaving
this
room
never
to
look
upon
your
face
again
he
wrote
jacob
nowell
address
upon
one
of
his
own
cards
and
gave
it
to
marian
and
then
prepared
to
take
his
departure
he
had
an
idea
that
the
bailiff
daughter
would
conduct
him
to
the
gate
and
that
he
would
be
able
to
make
some
inquiries
about
holbrook
on
his
way
it
is
possible
that
marian
guessed
his
intentions
in
this
respect
for
she
offered
to
go
with
him
to
the
gate
herself
and
he
could
not
with
any
decency
refuse
to
be
so
honoured
they
went
through
the
hall
together
where
all
was
as
still
and
lifeless
as
it
had
been
when
he
arrived
and
walked
slowly
side
by
side
along
the
broad
in
utter
silence
at
the
gate
gilbert
stopped
suddenly
and
gave
marian
his
hand
my
darling
he
said
i
forgive
you
with
all
my
heart
and
i
will
pray
for
your
happiness
will
you
try
to
forgive
my
husband
also
she
asked
in
her
plaintive
beseeching
way
i
do
not
know
what
i
am
capable
of
in
that
direction
i
promise
that
for
your
sake
i
will
not
attempt
to
do
him
any
injury
god
bless
you
for
that
promise
i
have
so
dreaded
the
chance
of
a
meeting
between
you
two
it
has
often
been
the
thought
of
that
which
has
made
me
unhappy
when
that
faithful
girl
nelly
has
noticed
my
low
spirits
you
have
removed
a
great
weight
from
my
mind
and
you
will
trust
me
better
after
that
promise
yes
i
will
trust
you
as
you
deserve
to
be
trusted
with
all
my
heart
and
now
it
is
a
hard
word
for
me
to
say
but
i
must
not
detain
you
here
in
the
cold
he
bent
his
head
and
pressed
his
lips
upon
the
slender
little
hand
which
held
the
key
of
the
gate
in
the
next
moment
he
was
outside
that
tall
iron
barrier
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
were
leaving
marian
in
a
prison
the
garden
with
its
poor
pale
scentless
autumn
flowers
had
a
dreary
look
under
the
dull
gray
sky
he
thought
of
the
big
empty
house
with
its
faded
traces
of
vanished
splendour
and
of
marian
lonely
life
in
it
with
unspeakable
pain
how
different
from
the
sunny
home
which
he
had
dreamed
of
in
the
days
gone
by
the
happy
domestic
life
which
he
had
fancied
they
two
might
lead
and
she
loves
this
man
well
enough
to
endure
the
dullest
existence
for
his
sake
he
said
to
himself
as
he
turned
his
back
at
last
upon
the
tall
iron
gate
having
lingered
there
for
some
minutes
after
marian
had
the
house
she
could
forget
all
our
plans
for
the
future
at
his
bidding
he
thought
of
this
with
a
jealous
pang
and
with
all
his
old
anger
against
his
unknown
rival
moved
by
an
impulse
of
love
and
pity
for
marian
he
had
promised
that
this
man
should
suffer
no
injury
at
his
hands
and
having
so
pledged
himself
he
must
needs
keep
his
word
but
there
were
certain
savage
feelings
and
primitive
instincts
in
his
breast
not
easily
to
be
vanquished
and
he
felt
that
now
he
had
bound
himself
to
keep
the
peace
in
relation
to
holbrook
it
would
be
well
that
those
two
should
not
meet
but
i
will
have
some
explanation
from
sir
david
forster
as
to
that
lie
he
told
me
he
said
to
himself
and
i
will
question
john
saltram
about
this
man
holbrook
john
saltram
john
holbrook
an
idea
flashed
into
his
brain
that
seemed
to
set
it
on
fire
what
if
john
saltram
and
john
holbrook
were
one
what
if
the
bosom
friend
whom
he
had
introduced
to
his
betrothed
had
played
the
traitor
and
stolen
her
from
him
in
the
next
moment
he
put
the
supposition
away
from
him
indignant
with
himself
for
being
capable
of
thinking
such
a
thing
even
for
an
instant
of
all
the
men
upon
earth
who
could
have
done
him
this
wrong
john
saltram
was
the
last
he
could
have
believed
guilty
yet
the
thought
recurred
to
him
many
times
after
this
with
a
foolish
tiresome
persistence
and
he
found
himself
going
over
the
circumstances
of
his
friend
acquaintance
with
marian
his
hasty
departure
from
lidford
his
return
there
later
during
sir
david
illness
let
him
consider
these
facts
as
closely
as
he
might
there
was
no
especial
element
of
suspicion
in
them
there
might
have
been
a
hundred
reasons
for
that
hurried
journey
to
london
nay
the
very
fact
itself
argued
against
the
supposition
that
saltram
had
fallen
in
love
with
his
friend
plighted
wife
and
now
the
purpose
of
his
life
being
so
far
achieved
gilbert
fenton
rode
back
to
winchester
next
day
restored
his
horse
to
its
proprietor
and
went
on
to
london
by
an
evening
train
chapter
xvii
miss
carley
admirers
there
were
times
in
which
marian
holbrook
life
would
have
been
utterly
lonely
but
for
the
companionship
of
ellen
carley
this
outspoken
country
girl
had
taken
a
fancy
to
holbrook
beautiful
wife
from
the
hour
of
her
arrival
at
the
grange
one
cheerless
march
evening
and
had
attached
herself
to
marian
from
that
moment
with
unalterable
affection
and
fidelity
the
girl
own
life
at
the
grange
had
been
lonely
enough
except
during
the
brief
summer
months
when
the
roomy
old
house
was
now
and
then
enlivened
a
little
by
the
advent
of
a
lodger
some
stray
angler
in
search
of
a
secluded
trout
stream
or
an
invalid
who
wanted
quiet
and
fresh
air
but
in
none
of
these
strangers
had
ellen
ever
taken
much
interest
they
had
come
and
gone
and
made
very
little
impression
upon
her
mind
though
she
had
helped
to
make
their
sojourn
pleasant
in
her
own
brisk
cheery
way
she
was
years
of
age
very
if
not
absolutely
pretty
with
dark
expressive
eyes
a
rosy
brunette
complexion
and
very
white
teeth
the
nose
belonged
to
the
inferior
order
of
pug
or
snub
the
forehead
was
low
and
broad
with
hair
rippling
over
it
hair
which
seemed
always
wanting
to
escape
from
its
neat
arrangement
into
a
multitude
of
mutinous
curls
she
was
altogether
a
young
person
whom
the
admirers
of
the
soubrette
style
of
beauty
might
have
found
very
charming
and
secluded
as
her
life
at
the
grange
had
been
she
had
already
more
than
one
admirer
she
used
to
relate
her
love
affairs
to
marian
holbrook
in
the
quiet
summer
evenings
as
the
two
sat
under
an
old
cedar
in
the
meadow
nearest
the
house
a
meadow
which
had
been
a
lawn
in
the
days
when
the
grange
was
in
the
occupation
of
great
folks
and
was
divided
from
a
broad
at
the
back
of
the
house
by
a
dry
moat
with
steep
sloping
banks
upon
which
there
was
a
wealth
of
primroses
and
violets
in
the
early
spring
ellen
carley
told
holbrook
of
her
admirers
and
received
sage
advice
from
that
experienced
young
matron
who
confessed
to
her
humble
companion
the
error
of
her
own
girlhood
and
how
she
had
jilted
the
most
devoted
and
generous
lover
that
ever
a
woman
could
boast
of
for
some
months
for
the
bright
honeymoon
period
of
her
wedded
life
marian
had
been
completely
happy
in
that
region
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
she
had
done
so
great
a
wrong
to
gilbert
fenton
except
under
the
influence
of
a
great
love
or
the
dominion
of
a
nature
powerful
enough
to
subjugate
her
own
both
these
influences
had
been
at
work
too
late
she
had
discovered
that
she
had
never
really
loved
gilbert
fenton
that
the
calm
grateful
liking
which
she
had
told
herself
must
needs
be
the
sole
version
of
the
grand
passion
whereof
her
nature
was
capable
had
been
only
the
tamest
most
ordinary
kind
of
friendship
after
all
and
that
in
the
depths
of
her
soul
there
was
a
capacity
for
an
utterly
different
attachment
a
love
which
was
founded
on
neither
respect
nor
gratitude
but
which
sprang
into
life
in
a
moment
fatal
and
from
its
birth
heaven
knows
she
had
struggled
bravely
against
this
luckless
passion
had
resisted
long
and
steadily
the
assiduous
pursuit
the
passionate
pleading
of
her
lover
who
would
not
be
driven
away
and
who
invented
all
kinds
of
expedients
for
seeing
her
however
difficult
the
business
might
be
or
however
resolutely
she
might
endeavour
to
avoid
him
it
was
only
after
her
uncle
death
when
her
mind
was
weakened
by
excessive
grief
that
her
strong
determination
to
remain
faithful
to
her
absent
betrothed
had
at
last
given
way
before
the
force
of
those
tender
passionate
prayers
and
she
had
consented
to
the
hasty
secret
marriage
which
her
lover
had
proposed
her
consent
once
given
not
a
moment
had
been
lost
the
business
had
been
hurried
on
with
the
utmost
eagerness
by
the
impetuous
lover
who
would
give
her
as
little
opportunity
as
possible
of
changing
her
mind
and
who
had
obtained
complete
mastery
of
her
will
from
the
moment
in
which
she
promised
to
be
his
wife
she
loved
him
with
all
the
unselfish
devotion
of
which
her
nature
was
capable
and
no
thought
of
the
years
to
come
or
of
what
her
future
life
might
be
with
this
man
of
whose
character
and
circumstances
she
knew
so
very
little
ever
troubled
her
having
sacrificed
her
fidelity
to
gilbert
fenton
she
held
all
other
sacrifices
light
as
air
never
considered
them
at
all
in
fact
when
did
a
generous
romantic
girl
of
nineteen
ever
stop
to
calculate
the
chances
of
the
future
or
fear
to
encounter
poverty
and
trouble
with
the
man
she
loved
to
marian
this
man
was
henceforth
all
the
world
it
was
not
that
he
was
handsomer
or
better
or
in
any
obvious
way
superior
to
gilbert
fenton
it
was
only
that
he
was
just
the
one
man
able
to
win
her
heart
that
mysterious
attraction
which
reason
can
never
reduce
to
rule
which
knows
no
law
of
precedent
or
experience
reigned
here
in
full
force
it
is
just
possible
that
the
desperate
circumstances
of
the
attachment
the
passionate
pursuit
of
the
lover
not
to
be
checked
by
any
obstacle
may
have
had
an
influence
upon
the
girl
mind
there
was
a
romance
in
such
love
as
this
that
had
not
existed
in
straightforward
wooing
and
marian
was
too
young
to
be
quite
proof
against
the
subtle
charm
of
a
secret
romantic
despairing
passion
for
some
time
she
was
very
happy
and
the
remote
with
its
gardens
and
fair
stretch
of
beyond
them
where
all
shade
and
beauty
had
not
yet
been
sacrificed
to
the
interests
of
agriculture
seemed
to
her
in
those
halcyon
days
a
kind
of
earthly
paradise
she
endured
her
husband
occasional
absence
from
this
rural
home
with
perfect
patience
these
absences
were
rare
and
brief
at
first
but
afterwards
grew
longer
and
more
frequent
nor
did
she
ever
sigh
for
any
brighter
or
gayer
life
than
this
which
they
led
together
at
the
grange
in
him
were
the
beginning
and
end
of
her
hopes
and
dreams
and
so
long
as
he
was
pleased
and
contented
she
was
completely
happy
it
was
only
when
a
change
came
in
him
very
slight
at
first
but
still
obvious
to
his
wife
tender
watchful
eyes
that
her
own
happiness
was
clouded
that
change
told
her
that
whatever
he
might
be
to
her
she
was
no
longer
all
the
world
to
him
he
loved
her
still
no
doubt
but
the
bright
of
his
love
was
over
and
his
wife
presence
had
no
longer
the
power
to
charm
away
every
dreary
thought
he
was
a
man
in
whose
disposition
there
was
a
lurking
vein
of
melancholy
a
kind
of
chronic
discontent
very
common
to
men
of
whom
it
has
been
said
that
they
might
do
great
things
in
the
world
and
who
have
succeeded
in
doing
nothing
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
holbrook
intended
to
keep
his
wife
shut
away
from
the
world
in
a
lonely
all
her
life
the
place
suited
him
very
well
for
the
present
the
apartments
at
the
grange
and
the
services
of
carley
and
his
dependents
had
been
put
at
his
disposal
by
the
owner
of
the
estate
together
with
all
farm
and
garden
produce
existence
here
therefore
cost
him
very
little
his
chief
expenses
were
in
gifts
to
the
bailiff
and
his
underlings
which
he
bestowed
with
a
liberal
hand
his
plans
for
the
future
were
as
yet
altogether
vague
and
unsettled
he
had
thoughts
of
emigration
of
beginning
life
afresh
in
a
new
country
anything
to
escape
from
the
perplexities
that
surrounded
him
here
and
he
had
his
reasons
for
keeping
his
wife
secluded
nor
did
his
conscience
disturb
him
much
he
was
a
man
who
had
his
conscience
in
very
good
training
as
to
the
unfairness
of
this
proceeding
marian
was
happy
he
told
himself
and
when
time
came
for
some
change
in
the
manner
of
her
existence
he
doubted
if
the
change
would
be
for
the
better
so
the
days
and
weeks
and
months
had
passed
away
bringing
little
variety
with
them
and
none
of
what
the
world
calls
pleasure
marian
read
and
worked
and
rambled
in
the
country
lanes
and
meadows
with
ellen
carley
and
visited
the
poor
people
now
and
then
as
she
had
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
at
lidford
she
had
not
very
much
to
give
them
but
gave
all
she
could
and
she
had
a
gentle
sympathetic
manner
which
made
her
welcome
amongst
them
most
of
all
where
there
were
children
for
whom
she
had
always
a
special
attraction
the
little
ones
clung
to
her
and
trusted
her
looking
up
at
her
lovely
face
with
spontaneous
affection
william
carley
the
bailiff
was
a
big
man
with
a
heavy
forbidding
countenance
and
a
taciturn
habit
by
no
means
calculated
to
secure
him
a
large
circle
of
friends
his
daughter
and
only
child
was
afraid
of
him
his
wife
had
been
afraid
of
him
in
her
time
and
had
faded
slowly
out
of
a
life
that
had
been
very
joyless
unawares
hiding
her
illness
from
him
to
the
last
as
if
it
had
been
a
sort
of
offence
against
him
to
be
ill
it
was
only
when
she
was
dying
that
the
bailiff
knew
he
was
going
to
lose
her
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
he
took
the
loss
very
calmly
whatever
natural
grief
he
may
have
felt
was
carefully
locked
in
his
own
breast
his
underlings
the
found
him
a
little
more
grumpy
than
usual
and
his
daughter
scarcely
dared
open
her
lips
to
him
for
a
month
after
the
funeral
but
from
that
time
forward
miss
carley
who
was
rather
a
spirited
damsel
took
a
very
different
tone
with
her
father
she
was
not
to
be
crushed
and
subdued
into
a
mere
submissive
shadow
as
her
mother
had
been
she
had
a
way
of
speaking
her
mind
on
all
occasions
which
was
by
no
means
agreeable
to
the
bailiff
if
he
drank
too
much
overnight
she
took
care
to
tell
him
of
it
early
next
morning
if
he
went
about
slovenly
and
unshaven
her
sharp
tongue
took
notice
of
the
fact
yet
with
all
this
she
waited
upon
him
and
provided
for
his
comfort
in
a
most
dutiful
manner
she
saved
his
money
by
her
dexterous
management
of
the
household
and
was
in
all
practical
matters
a
very
treasure
among
daughters
william
carley
liked
comfort
and
liked
money
still
better
and
he
was
quite
aware
that
his
daughter
was
valuable
to
him
though
he
was
careful
not
to
commit
himself
by
any
expression
of
that
opinion
he
knew
her
value
so
well
that
he
was
jealously
averse
to
the
idea
of
her
marrying
and
leaving
him
alone
at
the
grange
when
young
frank
randall
the
lawyer
son
took
to
calling
at
the
old
house
very
often
upon
summer
evenings
and
by
various
signs
and
tokens
showed
himself
smitten
with
ellen
carley
the
bailiff
treated
the
young
man
so
rudely
that
he
was
fain
to
cease
from
coming
altogether
and
to
content
himself
with
an
occasional
chance
meeting
in
the
lane
when
ellen
had
business
at
crosber
and
walked
there
alone
after
tea
he
would
not
have
been
a
particularly
good
match
for
any
one
being
only
an
articled
clerk
to
his
father
whose
business
in
the
little
of
malsham
was
by
no
means
extensive
and
william
carley
spoke
of
him
scornfully
as
a
pauper
he
was
a
tall
young
fellow
however
with
a
candid
pleasant
face
and
an
agreeable
manner
so
ellen
was
not
a
little
angry
with
her
father
for
his
rudeness
still
more
angry
with
him
for
his
encouragement
of
her
other
admirer
a
man
called
stephen
whitelaw
who
lived
about
a
mile
from
the
grange
and
farmed
his
own
land
an
estate
of
some
extent
for
that
part
of
the
country
if
you
must
marry
said
the
bailiff
and
it
what
girls
like
you
seem
to
be
always
thinking
about
you
ca
do
better
than
take
up
with
steph
whitelaw
he
a
warm
man
nell
and
a
wife
of
his
will
never
want
a
meal
of
victuals
or
a
good
gown
to
her
back
you
better
not
waste
your
smiles
and
your
civil
words
on
a
beggar
like
young
randall
who
have
a
home
to
take
you
to
for
these
ten
years
to
come
not
then
perhaps
for
there
not
much
to
be
made
by
law
in
malsham
and
when
his
father
dies
supposing
he
accommodating
enough
to
die
in
a
reasonable
time
which
it
ten
to
one
he
wo
be
the
young
man
will
have
his
mother
and
sisters
to
keep
upon
the
business
very
likely
and
there
be
a
nice
for
you
now
if
you
marry
my
old
friend
steph
he
can
make
you
a
lady
this
was
a
very
long
speech
for
carley
it
was
grumbled
out
in
short
spasmodic
sentences
between
the
slow
whiffs
of
his
pipe
as
he
sat
by
the
fire
in
a
little
parlour
off
the
hall
with
his
indefatigable
daughter
at
work
at
a
table
near
him
stephen
whitelaw
had
need
be
a
gentleman
himself
before
he
could
make
me
a
lady
nelly
answered
laughing
i
do
think
fine
clothes
can
make
gentlefolks
no
nor
farming
one
own
land
either
though
that
sounds
well
enough
i
am
not
in
any
hurry
to
leave
you
father
and
not
one
of
those
girls
who
are
always
thinking
of
getting
married
but
come
what
may
depend
upon
it
i
shall
never
marry
mr
whitelaw
why
not
pray
the
bailiff
asked
savagely
nelly
shook
out
the
shirt
she
had
been
repairing
for
her
father
and
then
began
to
fold
it
shaking
her
head
resolutely
at
the
same
time
because
i
detest
him
she
said
a
mean
close
discontented
creature
who
can
see
no
pleasure
in
life
except
i
hate
the
very
sight
of
his
pale
pinched
face
father
and
the
sound
of
his
hard
shrill
voice
if
i
had
to
choose
between
the
workhouse
and
marrying
stephen
whitelaw
i
choose
the
workhouse
yes
and
scrub
and
wash
and
drudge
and
toil
there
all
my
days
rather
than
be
mistress
of
wyncomb
farm
well
upon
my
word
exclaimed
the
father
taking
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
staring
aghast
at
his
daughter
in
a
stupor
of
indignant
surprise
you
a
pretty
article
you
a
nice
piece
of
goods
for
a
man
to
bring
up
and
waste
his
substance
upon
a
piece
of
goods
that
will
turn
round
upon
one
and
refuse
a
man
who
farms
his
own
land
mind
he
has
asked
you
yet
my
lady
and
never
may
for
aught
i
know
i
hope
he
never
will
father
nelly
answered
quietly
unsubdued
by
this
outburst
of
the
bailiff
if
he
does
and
you
do
snap
at
such
a
chance
you
need
never
look
for
a
sixpence
from
me
and
you
best
make
yourself
scarce
pretty
soon
into
the
bargain
i
have
no
such
trumpery
about
my
house
very
well
father
i
daresay
i
can
get
my
living
somewhere
else
without
working
much
harder
than
i
do
here
this
open
opposition
on
the
girl
part
made
william
carley
only
the
more
obstinately
bent
upon
that
marriage
which
seemed
to
him
such
a
brilliant
alliance
which
opened
up
to
him
the
prospect
of
a
comfortable
home
for
his
old
age
where
he
might
repose
after
his
labours
and
live
upon
the
fat
of
the
land
without
toil
or
care
he
had
a
considerable
contempt
for
the
owner
of
wyncomb
farm
whom
he
thought
a
poor
creature
both
as
a
man
and
a
farmer
and
he
fancied
that
if
his
daughter
married
stephen
whitelaw
he
might
become
the
actual
master
of
that
profitable
estate
he
could
twist
such
a
fellow
as
stephen
round
his
fingers
he
told
himself
when
invested
with
the
authority
of
a
whitelaw
was
a
little
man
of
about
years
of
age
a
man
who
had
remained
a
bachelor
to
the
surprise
of
his
neighbours
who
fancied
perhaps
that
the
owner
of
a
good
house
and
a
comfortable
income
was
in
a
manner
bound
by
his
obligation
to
society
to
take
to
himself
a
partner
with
whom
to
share
these
advantages
he
had
remained
unmarried
giving
no
damsel
ground
for
complaint
by
any
delusive
attentions
and
was
supposed
to
have
saved
a
good
deal
of
money
and
to
be
about
the
richest
man
in
those
parts
with
the
exception
of
the
landed
gentry
he
was
by
no
means
an
attractive
person
in
this
the
prime
of
his
manhood
he
had
a
narrow
face
with
sharp
features
and
a
pale
sickly
complexion
which
looked
as
if
he
had
spent
his
life
in
some
close
london
office
rather
than
in
the
free
sweet
air
of
his
native
fields
his
hair
was
of
a
reddish
tint
very
sleek
and
straight
and
always
combed
with
extreme
precision
upon
each
side
of
his
narrow
forehead
and
he
had
scanty
whiskers
of
the
same
unpopular
hue
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
smoothing
with
a
meditative
air
upon
his
sallow
cheeks
with
the
knobby
fingers
of
his
bony
hand
he
was
of
a
rather
nervous
temperament
inclined
to
silence
like
his
big
burly
friend
william
carley
and
had
a
deprecating
doubtful
way
of
expressing
his
opinion
at
all
times
in
spite
of
this
humility
of
manner
however
he
cherished
a
secret
pride
in
his
superior
wealth
and
was
apt
to
remind
his
associates
upon
occasion
that
he
could
buy
up
any
one
of
them
without
feeling
the
investment
after
having
attained
the
discreet
age
of
without
being
a
victim
to
the
tender
passion
whitelaw
might
reasonably
have
supposed
himself
exempt
from
the
weakness
so
common
to
mankind
but
such
had
he
indulged
in
it
would
have
been
premature
for
after
having
been
a
visitor
at
the
grange
and
of
the
bailiff
for
some
ten
years
it
slowly
dawned
upon
him
that
ellen
carley
was
a
very
pretty
girl
and
that
he
would
have
her
for
his
wife
and
no
other
her
brisk
manner
had
a
kind
of
charm
for
his
slow
apathetic
nature
her
rosy
brunette
face
with
its
bright
black
eyes
and
flashing
teeth
seemed
to
him
the
perfection
of
beauty
but
he
was
not
an
impetuous
lover
he
took
his
time
about
the
business
coming
two
or
three
times
a
week
to
smoke
his
pipe
with
william
carley
and
paying
nelly
some
awkward
blundering
compliment
now
and
then
in
his
deliberate
hesitating
way
he
had
supreme
confidence
in
his
own
position
and
his
money
and
was
troubled
by
no
doubt
as
to
the
ultimate
success
of
his
suit
it
was
true
that
nelly
treated
him
in
by
no
means
an
encouraging
manner
was
indeed
positively
uncivil
to
him
at
times
but
this
he
supposed
to
be
mere
feminine
coquetry
and
it
enhanced
the
attractions
of
the
girl
he
designed
to
make
his
wife
as
to
her
refusing
him
when
the
time
came
for
his
proposal
he
could
not
for
a
moment
imagine
such
a
thing
possible
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
any
woman
to
refuse
to
be
mistress
of
wyncomb
and
to
drive
her
own
whitechapel
cart
a
comfortable
hooded
vehicle
of
the
wagonette
species
which
was
popular
in
those
parts
so
stephen
whitelaw
took
his
time
contented
to
behold
the
object
of
his
affection
two
or
three
evenings
a
week
and
to
gaze
admiringly
upon
her
beauty
as
he
smoked
his
pipe
in
the
snug
little
parlour
at
the
grange
while
his
passion
grew
day
by
day
until
it
did
really
become
a
very
absorbing
feeling
second
only
to
his
love
of
money
and
wyncomb
farm
these
dull
sluggish
natures
are
capable
of
deeper
passions
than
the
world
gives
them
credit
for
and
are
as
slow
to
abandon
an
idea
as
they
are
to
entertain
it
it
was
ellen
carley
delight
to
tell
marian
of
her
trouble
and
to
protest
to
this
kind
confidante
again
and
again
that
no
persuasion
or
threats
of
her
father
should
ever
induce
her
to
marry
stephen
whitelaw
which
resolution
holbrook
fully
approved
there
was
a
little
gate
opening
from
a
broad
green
lane
into
one
of
the
fields
at
the
back
of
the
grange
and
here
sometimes
of
a
summer
evening
they
used
to
find
frank
randall
who
had
ridden
his
father
white
pony
all
the
way
from
malsham
for
the
sake
of
smoking
his
evening
cigar
on
that
particular
spot
they
used
to
find
him
seated
there
smoking
lazily
while
the
pony
cropped
the
grass
in
the
lane
close
at
hand
he
was
always
eager
to
do
any
little
service
for
holbrook
to
bring
her
books
or
anything
else
she
wanted
from
malsham
anything
that
might
make
an
excuse
for
his
coming
again
by
appointment
and
with
the
certainty
of
seeing
ellen
carley
it
was
only
natural
that
marian
should
be
inclined
to
protect
this
simple
which
offered
her
favourite
a
way
of
escape
from
the
odious
marriage
that
her
father
pressed
upon
her
the
girl
might
have
to
endure
poverty
as
frank
randall
wife
but
that
seemed
a
small
thing
in
the
eyes
of
marian
compared
with
the
horror
of
marrying
that
little
man
whom
she
had
seen
once
or
twice
sitting
by
the
fire
in
the
oak
parlour
with
his
small
eyes
fixed
in
a
dull
stare
upon

jacob
nowell
will
at
his
usual
hour
upon
the
evening
after
his
arrival
in
london
gilbert
fenton
called
at
the
silversmith
shop
in
queen
anne
court
he
found
jacob
nowell
weaker
than
when
he
had
seen
him
last
and
with
a
strange
old
look
as
if
extreme
age
had
come
upon
him
suddenly
he
had
been
compelled
to
call
in
a
medical
man
very
much
against
his
will
and
this
gentleman
had
told
him
that
his
condition
was
a
critical
one
and
that
it
would
be
well
for
him
to
arrange
his
affairs
quickly
and
to
hold
himself
prepared
for
the
worst
he
seemed
to
be
slightly
agitated
when
gilbert
told
him
that
his
granddaughter
had
been
found
will
she
come
to
me
do
you
think
he
asked
i
have
no
doubt
that
she
will
do
so
directly
she
hears
how
ill
you
have
been
she
was
very
much
pleased
at
the
idea
of
seeing
you
and
only
waited
for
her
husband
permission
to
come
but
i
do
suppose
she
will
wait
for
that
when
she
knows
of
your
illness
i
shall
write
to
her
immediately
do
jacob
nowell
said
eagerly
i
want
to
see
her
before
i
die
you
did
not
meet
the
husband
then
i
suppose
no
holbrook
was
not
there
he
told
jacob
nowell
all
that
it
was
possible
for
him
to
tell
about
his
interview
with
marian
and
the
old
man
seemed
warmly
interested
in
the
subject
death
was
very
near
him
and
the
savings
of
the
long
dreary
years
during
which
his
joyless
life
had
been
devoted
to
must
soon
pass
into
other
hands
he
wanted
to
know
something
of
the
person
who
was
to
profit
by
his
death
he
wanted
to
be
sure
that
when
he
was
gone
some
creature
of
his
own
flesh
and
blood
would
remember
him
kindly
not
for
the
sake
of
his
money
alone
but
for
something
more
than
that
i
shall
make
my
will
he
said
before
gilbert
left
him
i
do
mind
owning
to
you
that
i
have
something
considerable
to
bequeath
for
i
think
i
can
trust
you
and
if
i
should
die
before
my
grandchild
comes
to
me
you
will
see
that
she
has
her
rights
wo
you
you
will
take
care
that
she
is
not
cheated
by
her
husband
or
by
any
one
else
i
shall
hold
it
a
sacred
charge
to
protect
her
interests
so
far
as
it
is
possible
for
me
to
do
so
that
well
i
shall
make
you
one
of
the
executors
to
my
will
if
no
objection
no
the
executorship
will
bring
me
into
collision
with
holbrook
no
doubt
but
i
have
resolved
upon
my
line
of
conduct
with
regard
to
him
and
i
am
prepared
for
whatever
may
happen
my
chief
desire
now
is
to
be
a
real
friend
to
your
granddaughter
for
i
believe
she
has
need
of
friends
the
will
was
drawn
up
next
day
by
an
attorney
of
by
no
means
spotless
reputation
who
had
often
done
business
for
nowell
in
the
past
and
who
may
have
known
a
good
deal
about
the
origin
of
some
of
the
silver
which
found
its
way
to
the
old
silversmith
stores
he
was
a
gentleman
frequently
employed
in
the
defence
of
those
injured
innocents
who
appear
at
the
bar
of
the
old
bailey
and
was
not
at
all
particular
as
to
the
merits
of
the
cases
he
conducted
this
gentleman
embodied
desires
with
reference
to
the
disposal
of
his
worldly
goods
in
a
very
simple
and
straightforward
manner
all
that
jacob
nowell
had
to
leave
was
left
to
his
granddaughter
marian
holbrook
for
her
own
separate
use
and
maintenance
independent
of
any
husband
whatsoever
this
was
clear
enough
it
was
only
when
there
came
the
question
which
a
lawyer
puts
with
such
deadly
calmness
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
money
in
the
event
of
marian
holbrook
dying
intestate
that
any
perplexity
arose
of
course
if
she
has
children
you
like
the
money
to
go
to
them
said
medler
the
attorney
that
clear
enough
and
had
better
be
set
out
in
your
will
but
suppose
she
should
have
no
children
scarcely
like
all
you
leave
to
go
to
her
husband
who
is
quite
a
stranger
to
you
and
who
may
be
a
scoundrel
for
aught
you
know
no
i
certainly
should
much
care
about
enriching
this
holbrook
of
course
not
to
say
nothing
of
the
danger
there
would
be
in
giving
him
so
strong
an
interest
in
his
wife
death
not
but
what
i
daresay
contrive
to
squander
the
greater
part
of
the
money
during
her
lifetime
is
it
all
in
hard
cash
no
there
is
some
at
islington
which
pays
a
high
interest
and
there
are
other
freeholds
then
we
might
tie
those
up
giving
holbrook
only
the
income
it
is
essential
to
provide
against
possible
villany
or
extravagance
on
the
part
of
the
husband
women
are
so
weak
and
helpless
in
these
matters
and
in
the
event
of
your
granddaughter
dying
without
children
would
you
rather
let
the
estate
go
to
your
son
to
him
exclaimed
jacob
nowell
i
have
sworn
that
i
would
not
leave
him
sixpence
that
a
kind
of
oath
which
no
man
ever
considers
himself
bound
to
keep
said
the
lawyer
in
his
most
insinuating
tone
remember
it
only
a
remote
contingency
the
chances
are
that
your
granddaughter
will
have
a
family
to
inherit
this
property
and
that
she
will
survive
her
father
and
then
if
we
give
her
power
to
make
a
will
of
course
it
pretty
certain
that
she
leave
everything
to
this
husband
of
hers
but
i
think
we
ought
to
do
that
nowell
i
think
it
would
be
a
far
wiser
arrangement
to
give
this
young
lady
only
a
life
interest
in
the
real
estate
that
makes
the
husband
a
loser
by
her
death
instead
of
a
possible
gainer
to
a
large
amount
and
i
consider
that
your
son
name
has
a
right
to
come
in
here
i
can
not
acknowledge
that
he
has
any
such
right
his
extravagance
almost
ruined
me
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
his
ingratitude
would
have
broken
my
heart
if
i
had
been
weak
enough
to
suffer
myself
to
be
crushed
by
it
time
works
changes
amongst
the
worst
of
us
nowell
i
daresay
your
son
has
improved
his
habits
in
all
these
years
and
is
heartily
sorry
for
the
errors
of
his
youth
have
you
seen
him
medler
the
old
man
asked
quickly
seen
your
son
lately
no
indeed
my
dear
sir
i
had
no
notion
that
he
was
in
england
the
fact
is
that
percival
nowell
had
called
upon
medler
more
than
once
since
his
arrival
in
london
and
had
discussed
with
that
gentleman
the
chances
of
his
father
having
made
or
not
made
a
will
and
the
possibility
of
the
old
man
being
so
far
reconciled
to
him
as
to
make
a
will
in
his
favour
percival
nowell
had
gone
farther
than
this
and
had
promised
the
attorney
a
handsome
percentage
upon
anything
that
his
father
might
be
induced
to
leave
him
by
medler
influence
the
discussion
lasted
for
a
long
time
medler
pushing
on
stage
by
stage
in
the
favour
of
his
secret
client
anxious
to
see
whether
jacob
nowell
might
not
be
persuaded
to
allow
his
son
name
to
take
the
place
of
his
granddaughter
whom
he
had
never
seen
and
who
was
really
no
more
than
a
stranger
to
him
the
attorney
took
care
to
remind
him
but
on
this
point
the
old
man
was
immovable
he
would
leave
his
money
to
marian
and
to
no
one
else
he
had
no
desire
that
his
son
should
ever
profit
by
the
labours
and
deprivations
of
all
those
joyless
years
in
which
his
fortune
had
been
scraped
together
it
was
only
as
the
choice
of
the
lesser
evil
that
he
would
consent
to
percival
inheriting
the
property
from
his
daughter
rather
than
it
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
holbrook
the
lawyer
had
hard
work
before
he
could
bring
his
client
to
this
point
but
he
did
at
last
succeed
in
doing
so
and
percival
nowell
name
was
written
in
the
will
i
do
suppose
nowell
will
thank
me
much
for
what
i
done
though
i
had
difficulty
enough
in
doing
it
medler
said
to
himself
as
he
walked
slowly
homewards
after
this
prolonged
conference
in
queen
anne
court
for
of
course
the
chances
are
ten
to
one
against
his
surviving
his
daughter
still
these
young
women
sometimes
go
off
the
hooks
in
an
unexpected
way
and
he
come
into
the
reversion
there
was
only
one
satisfaction
for
the
attorney
and
that
lay
in
the
fact
that
this
long
laborious
interview
had
been
all
in
the
way
of
business
and
could
be
charged
for
accordingly
to
attending
at
your
own
house
with
relation
to
drawing
up
the
rough
draft
of
your
will
and
consultation
of
two
hours
and
a
half
thereupon
and
so
on
the
will
was
to
be
executed
next
day
and
medler
was
to
take
his
clerk
with
him
to
queen
anne
court
to
act
as
one
of
the
witnesses
he
had
obtained
one
other
triumph
in
the
course
of
the
discussion
which
was
the
insertion
of
his
own
name
as
executor
in
place
of
gilbert
fenton
against
whom
he
raised
so
many
specious
arguments
as
to
shake
the
old
man
faith
in
marian
jilted
lover
percival
nowell
dropped
in
upon
his
father
that
night
and
smoked
his
cigar
in
the
dingy
little
parlour
which
was
so
crowded
with
divers
kinds
of
merchandise
as
to
be
scarcely
habitable
the
old
man
son
came
here
almost
every
evening
and
behaved
altogether
in
a
very
dutiful
way
jacob
nowell
seemed
to
tolerate
rather
than
to
invite
his
visits
and
the
adventurer
tried
in
vain
to
get
at
the
real
feelings
underlying
that
emotionless
manner
i
think
i
might
work
round
the
governor
if
i
had
time
this
dutiful
son
said
to
himself
as
he
reflected
upon
the
aspect
of
affairs
in
queen
anne
court
but
i
fancy
the
old
chap
has
taken
his
ticket
for
the
next
world
booked
through
per
express
train
and
the
chances
are
that
keep
his
word
and
not
leave
me
sixpence
rather
hard
lines
that
after
my
taking
the
trouble
to
come
over
here
and
hunt
him
up
there
was
one
fact
that
nowell
the
younger
seemed
inclined
to
ignore
in
the
course
of
these
reflections
and
that
was
the
fact
that
he
had
not
left
america
until
he
had
completely
used
up
that
country
as
a
field
for
commercial
enterprise
and
had
indeed
made
his
name
so
far
notorious
in
connection
with
numerous
shady
transactions
as
to
leave
no
course
open
to
him
except
a
speedy
departure
since
his
coming
to
england
he
had
lived
entirely
on
credit
and
beyond
the
fine
clothes
he
wore
and
the
contents
of
his
two
portmanteaus
he
possessed
nothing
in
the
world
it
was
quite
true
that
he
had
done
very
well
in
new
york
but
his
had
been
secured
at
the
cost
of
other
people
and
after
having
started
some
speculations
and
living
extravagantly
upon
the
funds
of
his
victims
he
was
now
as
poor
as
he
had
been
when
he
left
belgium
for
america
the
of
a
house
in
the
iron
trade
in
this
position
he
might
have
prospered
in
a
moderate
way
and
might
have
profited
by
the
expensive
education
which
had
given
him
nothing
but
showy
agreeable
manners
had
he
been
capable
of
steadiness
and
industry
but
of
these
virtues
he
was
utterly
deficient
possessing
instead
a
genius
for
that
kind
of
swindling
which
keeps
just
upon
the
safe
side
of
felony
he
had
lived
pleasantly
enough
for
many
years
by
the
exercise
of
this
agreeable
talent
so
pleasantly
indeed
that
he
had
troubled
himself
very
little
about
his
chances
of
inheriting
his
father
savings
it
was
only
when
he
had
exhausted
all
expedients
for
making
money
on
the
other
side
that
he
turned
his
thoughts
in
the
direction
of
queen
anne
court
and
began
to
speculate
upon
the
probability
of
jacob
nowell
good
graces
being
worth
the
trouble
of
cultivation
the
prospectuses
which
he
had
shown
his
father
were
mere
waste
paper
the
useless
surplus
stationery
remaining
from
a
scheme
that
had
failed
to
enlist
the
sympathies
of
a
transatlantic
public
but
he
fancied
that
his
only
chance
with
the
old
man
lay
in
an
assumption
of
prosperity
so
he
carried
matters
with
a
high
hand
throughout
the
business
and
swaggered
in
the
little
dusky
parlour
behind
the
shop
just
as
he
had
swaggered
on
broadway
or
at
delmonico
in
the
heyday
of
his
commercial
success
he
called
at
medler
office
the
day
after
jacob
nowell
will
had
been
executed
having
had
no
hint
of
the
fact
from
his
father
the
solicitor
told
him
what
had
been
done
and
how
the
most
strenuous
efforts
on
his
part
had
only
resulted
in
the
insertion
of
percival
name
after
that
of
his
daughter
whatever
indignation
nowell
may
have
felt
at
the
fact
that
his
daughter
had
been
preferred
before
him
he
contrived
to
keep
hidden
in
his
own
mind
the
lawyer
was
surprised
at
the
quiet
gravity
with
which
he
received
the
intelligence
he
listened
to
medler
statement
of
the
case
with
the
calmest
air
of
deliberation
seemed
indeed
to
be
thinking
so
deeply
that
it
was
as
if
his
thoughts
had
wandered
away
from
the
subject
in
hand
to
some
theme
which
allowed
of
more
profound
speculation
and
if
she
should
die
childless
i
should
get
all
the
property
he
said
at
last
waking
up
suddenly
from
that
state
of
abstraction
and
turning
his
thoughtful
face
upon
the
lawyer
yes
all
the
real
estate
would
be
yours
have
you
any
notion
what
the
property
is
worth
not
an
exact
notion
your
father
gave
me
a
list
of
investments
altogether
i
should
fancy
the
income
will
be
something
handsome
between
two
and
three
thousand
a
year
perhaps
strange
it
for
a
man
with
all
that
money
to
have
lived
such
a
life
as
your
father
strange
indeed
percival
nowell
cried
with
a
sneer
and
my
daughter
will
step
into
two
or
three
thousand
a
year
he
went
on
very
pleasant
for
her
and
for
her
husband
into
the
bargain
of
course
i
not
going
to
say
that
i
would
rather
have
had
the
income
myself
you
scarcely
swallow
that
as
a
man
of
the
world
you
see
medler
but
the
girl
is
my
only
child
and
though
circumstances
have
divided
us
for
the
greater
part
of
our
lives
blood
is
thicker
than
water
and
in
short
since
there
was
no
getting
the
governor
to
do
the
right
thing
and
leave
this
money
to
me
it
the
next
best
thing
that
he
should
leave
it
to
marian
to
say
nothing
of
the
possibility
of
her
dying
without
children
and
your
coming
into
the
property
after
all
said
medler
wondering
a
little
at
nowell
philosophical
manner
of
looking
at
the
question
sir
exclaimed
percival
indignantly
do
you
imagine
me
capable
of
speculating
upon
the
untimely
death
of
my
only
child
the
lawyer
shrugged
his
shoulders
doubtfully
in
the
course
of
his
varied
experience
he
had
found
men
and
women
capable
of
very
queer
things
when
their
pecuniary
interests
were
at
stake
and
he
had
not
a
most
exalted
opinion
of
nowell
virtue
he
knew
too
many
secrets
connected
with
his
early
career
remember
if
ever
by
any
strange
chance
you
should
come
into
this
property
you
have
me
to
thank
for
getting
your
name
into
the
will
and
for
giving
your
daughter
only
a
life
interest
she
would
have
had
every
penny
left
to
her
without
reserve
if
i
had
fought
for
your
interests
as
hard
as
ever
i
fought
for
anything
in
the
whole
course
of
my
professional
career
you
a
good
fellow
medler
and
if
ever
fortune
should
favour
me
which
hardly
seems
on
the
cards
i
forget
what
i
promised
you
the
other
day
i
daresay
you
did
the
best
you
could
for
me
though
it
amount
to
much
when
it
done
long
after
percival
nowell
had
left
him
medler
sat
idle
at
his
desk
meditating
upon
his
interview
with
that
gentleman
i
ca
half
understand
his
coolness
he
said
to
himself
i
expected
him
to
be
as
savage
as
a
bear
when
he
found
that
the
old
man
had
left
him
nothing
i
thought
i
should
hear
nothing
but
execrations
and
blasphemies
for
i
think
i
know
my
gentleman
pretty
well
of
old
and
that
he
not
a
person
to
take
a
disappointment
of
this
kind
very
sweetly
there
must
be
something
under
that
quiet
manner
of
his
perhaps
he
knows
more
about
his
daughter
than
he
cares
to
let
out
knows
that
she
is
sickly
and
that
he
stands
a
good
chance
of
surviving
her
there
was
indeed
a
lurking
desperation
under
percival
nowell
airy
manner
of
which
the
people
amongst
whom
he
lived
had
no
suspicion
unless
some
sudden
turn
in
the
wheel
of
fortune
should
change
the
aspect
of
affairs
for
him
very
soon
ruin
most
complete
and
utter
was
inevitable
a
man
can
not
go
on
very
long
without
money
and
in
order
to
pay
his
nowell
had
been
obliged
to
raise
the
funds
from
an
accommodating
gentleman
with
whom
he
had
done
business
in
years
gone
by
and
who
was
very
familiar
with
his
own
and
his
father
autograph
the
bill
upon
which
this
gentleman
advanced
the
money
in
question
bore
the
name
of
jacob
nowell
and
was
drawn
at
three
months
percival
had
persuaded
himself
that
before
the
three
months
were
out
his
father
would
be
in
his
grave
and
his
executors
would
scarcely
be
in
a
position
to
dispute
the
genuineness
of
the
signature
in
the
meantime
the
money
thus
obtained
enabled
him
to
float
on
he
paid
his
and
removed
to
lodgings
in
one
of
the
narrow
streets
to
the
of
tottenham
court
road
an
obscure
lodging
enough
where
he
had
a
couple
of
comfortable
rooms
on
the
first
floor
and
where
his
going
out
and
coming
in
attracted
little
notice
here
as
at
the
hotel
he
chose
to
assume
the
name
of
norton
instead
of
his
legitimate
cognomen

gilbert
asks
a
question
gilbert
fenton
called
at
john
saltram
chambers
within
a
day
or
two
of
his
return
from
hampshire
he
had
a
strange
almost
feverish
eagerness
to
see
his
old
friend
again
a
sense
of
having
wronged
him
for
that
one
brief
moment
of
thought
in
which
the
possibility
of
his
guilt
had
flashed
across
his
mind
and
with
this
feeling
there
was
mingled
a
suspicion
that
john
saltram
had
not
acted
quite
fairly
to
him
that
he
had
kept
back
knowledge
which
must
have
come
to
him
as
an
intimate
ally
of
sir
david
forster
he
found
saltram
at
home
in
the
familiar
untidy
room
with
the
old
chaos
of
books
and
papers
about
him
he
looked
tired
and
ill
and
rose
to
greet
his
visitor
with
a
weary
air
as
if
nothing
in
the
world
possessed
much
interest
for
him
why
john
you
are
as
pallid
as
a
ghost
gilbert
exclaimed
grasping
the
hand
extended
to
him
and
thinking
of
that
one
moment
in
which
he
had
fancied
he
was
never
to
touch
that
hand
again
you
have
been
at
the
old
work
i
suppose
overdoing
it
as
usual
no
i
have
been
working
very
little
for
these
last
few
days
the
truth
is
i
have
not
been
able
to
work
the
divine
afflatus
would
come
down
upon
me
there
are
times
when
a
man
brain
seems
to
be
made
of
melted
butter
mine
has
been
like
that
for
the
last
week
or
so
i
thought
you
were
going
back
to
your
fishing
village
near
oxford
no
i
was
not
in
spirits
for
that
i
have
dined
two
or
three
times
in
cavendish
square
and
have
been
made
much
of
and
have
contrived
to
forget
my
troubles
for
a
few
hours
you
talk
of
your
troubles
as
if
you
were
very
heavily
burdened
and
yet
for
the
life
of
me
i
can
not
see
what
you
have
to
complain
of
gilbert
said
wonderingly
of
course
not
that
is
always
the
case
with
one
friends
even
the
best
of
them
it
only
the
man
who
wears
the
shoe
that
knows
why
it
pinches
and
galls
him
but
what
have
you
been
doing
since
i
saw
you
last
i
have
been
in
hampshire
indeed
said
john
saltram
looking
him
full
in
the
face
and
what
took
you
into
that
quarter
of
the
world
i
thought
you
took
more
interest
in
my
affairs
than
to
have
to
ask
that
question
i
went
to
look
for
marian
holbrook
and
i
found
her
poor
old
fellow
saltram
said
gently
and
was
there
any
satisfaction
for
you
in
the
meeting
yes
and
no
there
was
a
kind
of
mournful
pleasure
in
seeing
the
dear
face
once
more
she
must
have
been
surprised
to
see
you
she
was
no
doubt
surprised
unpleasantly
perhaps
but
she
received
me
very
kindly
and
was
perfectly
frank
upon
every
subject
except
her
husband
she
would
tell
me
nothing
about
him
neither
his
position
in
the
world
nor
his
profession
if
he
has
one
as
i
suppose
he
has
she
owned
he
was
not
rich
and
that
is
about
all
she
said
of
him
poor
girl
i
do
not
think
she
is
happy
what
ground
have
you
for
such
an
idea
her
face
which
told
me
a
great
deal
more
than
her
words
her
beauty
is
very
much
faded
since
the
summer
evening
when
i
first
saw
her
in
lidford
church
she
seems
to
lead
a
lonely
life
in
the
old
to
which
her
husband
brought
her
immediately
after
their
marriage
a
life
which
few
women
would
care
to
lead
and
now
john
i
want
to
know
how
it
is
you
have
kept
back
the
truth
from
me
in
this
matter
that
you
have
treated
me
with
a
reserve
which
i
had
no
right
to
expect
from
a
friend
what
have
i
kept
from
you
your
knowledge
of
this
man
holbrook
what
makes
you
suppose
that
i
have
any
knowledge
of
him
the
fact
that
he
is
a
friend
of
sir
david
forster
the
house
in
which
i
found
marian
belongs
to
sir
david
and
was
lent
by
him
to
mr
holbrook
i
do
not
know
every
friend
of
forster
he
is
a
man
who
picks
up
his
acquaintance
in
the
highways
and
byways
and
drops
them
when
he
is
tired
of
them
will
you
tell
me
on
your
honour
that
you
know
nothing
of
this
mr
holbrook
certainly
gilbert
fenton
gave
a
weary
sigh
and
then
seated
himself
silently
opposite
saltram
he
could
not
afford
to
doubt
this
friend
of
his
the
whole
fabric
of
his
life
must
have
dropped
to
pieces
if
john
saltram
had
played
him
false
his
single
venture
as
a
lover
having
ended
in
shipwreck
he
seemed
to
have
nothing
left
him
but
friendship
and
that
kind
of
which
had
made
his
friend
always
appear
to
him
something
better
than
he
really
was
had
grown
stronger
with
him
since
marian
desertion
o
jack
he
said
presently
i
could
bear
anything
in
this
world
better
than
the
notion
that
you
could
betray
me
that
you
could
break
faith
with
me
for
the
sake
of
another
man
i
am
not
likely
to
do
that
there
is
no
man
upon
this
earth
i
care
for
very
much
except
you
i
am
not
a
man
prone
to
friendship
in
fact
i
am
a
selfish
worthless
fellow
at
the
best
gilbert
and
hardly
merit
your
serious
consideration
it
would
be
wiser
of
you
to
think
of
me
as
i
really
am
and
to
think
very
little
of
me
you
did
not
show
yourself
remarkably
selfish
when
you
nursed
me
through
that
fever
at
the
hazard
of
your
own
life
pshaw
that
was
nothing
i
could
not
have
done
less
in
the
position
in
which
we
two
were
such
sacrifices
as
those
count
for
very
little
it
is
when
a
man
own
happiness
is
in
the
scale
that
the
black
spot
shows
itself
i
tell
you
gilbert
i
am
not
worth
your
friendship
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
go
your
own
way
and
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
me
saltram
had
said
this
kind
of
thing
very
often
in
the
past
so
that
the
words
had
no
especial
significance
to
gilbert
he
only
thought
that
his
friend
was
in
one
of
those
gloomy
moods
which
were
common
to
him
at
times
i
could
not
do
without
your
friendship
jack
he
said
remember
how
barren
the
world
is
to
me
now
i
have
nothing
left
but
that
a
poor
substitute
for
better
things
gilbert
i
am
never
likely
to
be
much
good
to
you
or
to
myself
by
the
way
have
you
seen
anything
lately
of
that
old
man
you
told
me
about
miss
nowell
grandfather
i
saw
him
the
other
night
he
is
very
ill
dying
i
believe
i
have
written
to
marian
to
tell
her
that
if
she
does
not
come
very
quickly
to
see
him
there
is
a
chance
of
her
not
finding
him
alive
and
she
will
come
of
course
i
suppose
so
she
talked
of
waiting
for
her
husband
consent
but
she
will
scarcely
do
that
when
she
knows
her
grandfather
precarious
state
i
shall
go
to
queen
anne
court
after
i
leave
you
to
ascertain
if
there
has
been
any
letter
from
her
to
announce
her
coming
she
is
a
complete
stranger
in
london
and
may
be
embarrassed
if
she
arrives
at
the
station
alone
but
i
should
imagine
her
husband
would
meet
her
there
supposing
him
to
be
in
town
fenton
stayed
with
his
friend
about
an
hour
after
this
but
john
saltram
was
not
in
a
communicative
mood
and
the
talk
lagged
wearily
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
gilbert
when
they
had
bidden
each
other
and
he
was
out
in
the
noisy
streets
once
more
making
his
way
towards
queen
anne
court
chapter
xx
drifting
away
gilbert
fenton
found
jacob
nowell
worse
so
much
worse
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
take
to
his
bed
and
was
lying
in
a
dull
shabby
room
upstairs
faintly
lighted
by
one
tallow
candle
on
the
mantelpiece
marian
was
there
when
gilbert
went
in
she
had
arrived
a
couple
of
hours
before
and
had
taken
her
place
at
once
by
the
her
bonnet
and
shawl
were
thrown
carelessly
upon
a
dilapidated
couch
by
the
window
gilbert
fancied
she
looked
like
a
ministering
angel
as
she
sat
by
the
bed
her
soft
brown
hair
falling
loosely
round
the
lovely
face
her
countenance
almost
divine
in
its
expression
of
tenderness
and
pity
you
came
to
town
alone
marian
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
the
old
man
was
in
a
doze
at
this
moment
lying
with
his
pinched
withered
face
turned
towards
his
granddaughter
his
feeble
hand
in
hers
yes
i
came
alone
my
husband
had
not
come
back
and
i
would
not
delay
any
longer
after
receiving
your
letter
i
am
very
glad
i
came
my
poor
grandfather
seemed
so
pleased
to
see
me
he
was
wandering
a
little
when
i
first
came
in
but
brightened
wonderfully
afterwards
and
quite
understood
who
i
was
the
old
man
awoke
presently
he
was
in
a
state
but
seemed
to
know
his
granddaughter
and
clung
to
her
calling
her
by
name
with
senile
fondness
his
mind
wandered
back
to
the
past
and
he
talked
to
his
son
as
if
he
had
been
in
the
room
reproaching
him
for
his
extravagance
his
college
debts
which
had
been
the
ruin
of
his
careful
father
at
another
moment
he
fancied
that
his
wife
was
still
alive
and
spoke
to
her
telling
her
that
their
grandchild
had
been
christened
after
her
and
that
she
was
to
love
the
girl
and
then
the
delirium
left
him
for
a
time
his
mind
grew
clearer
and
he
talked
quite
rationally
in
his
low
feeble
way
is
that
mr
fenton
he
asked
the
room
so
dark
i
ca
see
very
well
she
has
come
to
me
you
see
she
a
good
girl
her
eyes
are
like
my
wife
yes
she
a
good
girl
it
seems
a
hard
thing
that
i
should
have
lived
all
these
years
without
knowing
her
lived
alone
with
no
one
about
me
but
those
that
were
on
the
watch
for
my
money
and
eager
to
cheat
me
at
every
turn
my
life
might
have
been
happier
if
i
had
a
grandchild
to
keep
me
company
and
i
might
have
left
this
place
and
lived
like
a
gentleman
for
her
sake
but
that
all
past
and
gone
you
be
rich
when
i
dead
marian
yes
what
most
people
would
count
rich
you
wo
squander
the
money
will
you
my
dear
as
your
father
would
if
it
were
left
to
him
no
grandfather
but
tell
me
about
my
father
is
he
still
living
the
girl
asked
eagerly
never
mind
him
child
answered
jacob
nowell
he
has
troubled
himself
about
you
and
you
ca
do
better
than
keep
clear
of
him
no
good
ever
came
of
anything
he
did
yet
and
no
good
ever
will
come
you
have
anything
to
do
with
him
marian
he
try
to
get
all
your
money
away
from
you
if
you
give
him
a
chance
depend
upon
that
he
is
living
then
o
my
dear
grandfather
do
tell
me
something
more
about
him
remember
that
whatever
his
errors
may
have
been
he
is
my
father
the
only
relation
i
have
in
the
world
except
yourself
his
whole
life
has
been
one
long
error
answered
jacob
nowell
i
tell
you
child
the
less
you
know
of
him
the
better
he
was
not
to
be
moved
from
this
and
would
say
no
more
about
his
son
in
spite
of
marian
earnest
pleading
the
doctor
came
in
presently
for
the
second
time
that
evening
and
forbade
his
patient
talking
any
more
he
told
gilbert
as
he
left
the
house
that
the
old
man
life
was
now
only
a
question
of
so
many
days
or
so
many
hours
the
old
woman
who
did
all
the
work
of
jacob
nowell
establishment
a
widow
whom
nobody
in
that
quarter
ever
remembered
in
any
other
condition
than
that
of
widowhood
had
prepared
a
small
bedroom
at
the
back
of
the
house
for
marian
a
room
in
which
percival
had
slept
in
his
early
boyhood
and
where
the
daughter
found
faint
traces
of
her
father
life
macready
as

in
a
spangled
tunic
with

of
actual
satin

picture
after
the
or
realistic
tendency
commonly
found
in
such
juvenile
works
of
art
hung
over
the
narrow
painted
mantelpiece
the
fond
mother
had
had
this
masterpiece
framed
and
glazed
in
the
days
when
her
son
was
still
a
little
lad
unspoiled
by
university
life
and
those
splendid
aspirations
which
afterwards
made
his
home
hateful
to
him
there
were
some
tattered
books
upon
a
shelf
by
the
bed
school
prizes
an
old
virgil
a
robinson
crusoe
shorn
of
its
binding
the
boy
name
was
written
in
them
in
a
scrawling
schoolboy
hand
not
once
but
many
times
after
the
fashion
of
juvenile
bibliopoles
with
primitive
rhymes
in
latin
and
english
setting
forth
his
proprietorship
in
the
volumes
caricatures
were
scribbled
upon
the
and
margins
of
the
books
the
date
whereof
looked
very
old
to
marian
long
before
her
own
birth
it
was
not
till
very
late
that
she
consented
to
leave
the
old
man
side
and
go
to
the
room
which
had
been
got
ready
for
her
to
lie
down
for
an
hour
she
would
not
hear
of
any
longer
rest
though
the
humble
widow
was
quite
pathetic
in
her
entreaties
that
the
dear
young
lady
would
try
to
get
a
good
night
sleep
and
would
leave
the
care
of
nowell
to
her
who
knew
his
ways
poor
dear
gentleman
and
would
watch
over
him
as
carefully
as
if
he
had
been
her
own
poor
husband
who
kept
his
bed
for
a
twelvemonth
before
he
died
and
had
to
be
waited
on
hand
and
foot
marian
told
this
woman
that
she
did
not
want
rest
she
had
come
to
town
on
purpose
to
be
with
her
grandfather
and
would
stay
with
him
as
long
as
he
needed
her
care
she
did
however
consent
to
go
to
her
room
for
a
little
in
the
early
november
dawn
when
jacob
nowell
had
fallen
into
a
profound
sleep
but
when
she
did
lie
down
sleep
would
not
come
to
her
she
could
not
help
listening
to
every
sound
in
the
opposite
room
the
falling
of
a
cinder
the
stealthy
footfall
of
the
watcher
moving
cautiously
about
now
and
then
listening
still
more
intently
when
all
was
silent
expecting
every
moment
to
hear
herself
summoned
suddenly
the
and
the
dark
shadow
of
coming
death
brought
back
the
thought
of
that
bitter
time
when
her
uncle
was
lying
unconscious
and
speechless
in
the
pretty
room
at
lidford
with
the
wintry
light
shining
coldly
upon
his
stony
face
while
she
sat
by
his
pillow
watching
him
in
hopeless
silent
agony
waiting
for
that
dread
change
which
they
had
told
her
was
the
only
change
that
could
come
to
him
on
earth
the
scene
itself
in
her
mind
with
all
the
old
anguish
she
shut
it
out
at
last
with
a
great
effort
and
began
to
think
of
what
her
grandfather
had
said
to
her
she
was
to
be
rich
she
who
had
been
a
dependant
upon
others
all
her
life
was
to
know
the
security
and
liberty
that
must
needs
go
along
with
wealth
she
was
glad
of
this
much
more
for
her
husband
sake
than
her
own
she
knew
that
the
cares
which
had
clouded
their
life
of
late
which
had
made
him
seem
to
love
her
less
than
he
had
loved
her
at
first
had
their
chief
origin
in
want
of
money
what
happiness
it
would
be
for
her
to
lift
this
burden
from
his
life
to
give
him
peace
and
security
for
the
years
to
come
her
thoughts
wandered
away
into
the
bright
region
of
after
this
and
she
fancied
what
their
lives
might
be
without
that
dull
sordid
trouble
of
pecuniary
embarrassments
she
fancied
her
husband
with
all
the
fetters
removed
that
had
hampered
his
footsteps
hitherto
winning
a
name
and
a
place
in
the
world
it
is
so
natural
for
a
romantic
inexperienced
girl
to
believe
that
the
man
she
loves
was
born
to
achieve
greatness
and
that
if
he
misses
distinction
it
is
from
the
perversity
of
his
surroundings
or
from
his
own
carelessness
never
from
the
fact
of
his
being
only
a
very
small
creature
after
all
it
was
broad
daylight
when
marian
rose
after
an
hour
of
sleeplessness
and
thought
and
refreshed
herself
with
the
contents
of
the
cracked
upon
the
rickety
little
the
old
man
was
still
asleep
when
she
went
back
to
his
room
but
his
breathing
was
more
troubled
than
it
had
been
the
night
before
and
the
widow
who
was
experienced
in
sickness
and
death
told
marian
that
he
would
not
last
very
long
the
shopman
luke
tulliver
had
come
upstairs
to
see
his
master
and
was
hovering
over
the
bed
with
a
ghoulish
aspect
this
young
man
looked
very
sharply
at
marian
as
she
came
into
the
room
seemed
indeed
hardly
able
to
take
his
eyes
from
her
face
and
there
was
not
much
favour
in
his
look
he
knew
who
she
was
and
had
been
told
how
kindly
the
old
man
had
taken
to
her
in
those
last
moments
of
his
life
and
he
hated
her
with
all
his
heart
and
soul
having
devoted
all
the
force
of
his
mind
for
the
last
ten
years
to
the
cultivation
of
his
employer
good
graces
hoping
that
nowell
having
no
one
else
to
whom
to
leave
his
money
would
end
by
leaving
it
all
to
him
and
here
was
a
granddaughter
sprung
from
goodness
knows
where
to
cheat
him
out
of
all
his
chances
he
had
always
suspected
gilbert
fenton
of
being
a
dangerous
sort
of
person
and
it
was
no
doubt
he
who
had
brought
about
this
introduction
to
the
annihilation
of
hopes
this
young
man
took
his
place
in
a
vacant
chair
by
the
fire
as
if
determined
to
stop
while
marian
seated
herself
quietly
by
the
pillow
thinking
only
of
that
one
occupant
of
the
room
and
supposing
that
tulliver
presence
was
a
mark
of
fidelity
the
old
man
woke
with
a
start
presently
and
looked
about
him
in
a
slow
bewildered
way
for
some
moments
who
that
he
asked
presently
pointing
to
the
figure
by
the
hearth
it
only
tulliver
sir
the
widow
answered
he
so
anxious
about
you
poor
young
man
i
do
want
him
said
jacob
nowell
impatiently
i
do
want
his
anxiety
i
want
to
be
alone
with
my
granddaughter
do
send
me
away
sir
tulliver
pleaded
in
a
piteous
tone
i
do
deserve
to
be
sent
away
like
a
stranger
after
serving
you
faithfully
for
the
last
ten
years
and
being
well
paid
for
your
services
gasped
the
old
man
i
tell
you
i
do
want
you
go
downstairs
and
mind
the
shop
it
not
open
yet
sir
remonstrated
tulliver
then
it
ought
to
be
i
have
no
idling
and
shirking
because
i
go
down
and
take
down
the
shutters
directly
let
the
business
go
on
just
as
if
i
was
there
to
watch
it
i
going
sir
whimpered
the
young
man
but
it
does
seem
rather
a
poor
return
after
having
served
you
as
i
have
and
loved
you
as
if
been
my
own
father
very
much
men
love
their
fathers
i
did
ask
you
to
love
me
did
i
or
hire
you
for
that
or
pay
you
for
it
pshaw
man
i
know
you
you
wanted
my
money
like
the
rest
of
them
and
i
did
mind
your
thinking
there
was
a
chance
of
your
getting
it
i
rather
encouraged
the
notion
at
odd
times
it
made
you
a
better
servant
and
kept
you
honest
but
now
that
i
dying
i
can
afford
to
tell
the
truth
this
young
lady
will
have
all
my
money
every
sixpence
of
it
except
pounds
to
mitchin
yonder
and
now
you
can
go
have
got
something
perhaps
in
a
small
way
if
you
been
less
of
a
sneak
and
a
listener
but
you
played
your
cards
a
trifle
too
well
the
old
man
had
raised
himself
up
in
his
bed
and
rallied
considerably
while
he
made
this
speech
he
seemed
to
take
a
malicious
pleasure
in
his
shopman
disappointment
but
when
luke
tulliver
had
slowly
withdrawn
from
the
room
with
a
last
venomous
look
at
marian
jacob
nowell
sank
back
upon
his
pillow
exhausted
by
his
unwonted
animation
you
do
know
what
a
deep
schemer
that
young
man
has
been
marian
he
said
and
how
i
have
laughed
in
my
sleeve
at
his
manoeuvres
the
dull
november
day
dragged
itself
slowly
through
marian
never
leaving
her
post
by
the
jacob
nowell
spent
those
slow
hours
in
fitful
sleep
and
frequent
intervals
of
wakefulness
in
which
he
would
talk
to
marian
however
she
might
urge
him
to
remember
the
doctor
injunctions
that
he
should
be
kept
perfectly
quiet
it
seemed
indeed
to
matter
very
little
whether
he
obeyed
the
doctor
or
not
since
the
end
was
inevitable
one
of
the
curates
of
the
parish
came
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
read
and
prayed
beside
the
old
man
bed
jacob
nowell
joining
in
the
prayers
in
a
way
for
many
years
of
his
life
he
had
neglected
all
religious
duties
it
was
years
since
he
had
been
inside
a
church
perhaps
he
had
not
been
once
since
the
death
of
his
wife
who
had
persuaded
him
to
go
with
her
sometimes
to
the
evening
service
when
he
had
generally
scandalised
her
by
falling
asleep
during
the
delivery
of
the
sermon
all
that
the
curate
told
him
now
about
the
necessity
that
he
should
make
his
peace
with
his
god
and
prepare
himself
for
a
world
to
come
had
a
sound
to
him
he
thought
more
about
the
silver
downstairs
and
what
it
was
likely
to
realize
in
the
even
in
this
supreme
hour
his
conscience
did
not
trouble
him
much
about
the
doubtful
modes
by
which
some
of
the
plate
he
had
dealt
in
had
reached
his
hands
if
he
had
not
bought
the
things
some
other
dealer
would
have
bought
them
that
is
the
way
in
which
he
would
have
argued
the
question
had
he
been
called
upon
to
argue
it
at
all
fenton
came
in
the
evening
to
see
the
old
man
and
stood
for
a
little
time
by
the
bedside
watching
him
as
he
slept
and
talking
in
a
low
voice
to
marian
he
asked
her
how
long
she
was
going
to
remain
in
queen
court
and
found
her
ideas
very
vague
upon
that
subject
if
the
end
is
so
near
as
the
doctor
says
it
would
be
cruel
to
leave
my
grandfather
till
all
is
over
she
said
i
wonder
that
your
husband
has
not
come
to
you
if
he
is
in
london
gilbert
remarked
to
her
presently
he
found
himself
very
often
wondering
about
her
husband
proceedings
in
no
indulgent
mood
he
may
not
be
in
london
she
answered
seeming
a
little
vexed
by
the
observation
i
am
quite
sure
that
he
will
do
whatever
is
best
but
if
he
should
not
come
to
you
and
if
your
grandfather
should
die
while
you
are
alone
here
i
trust
you
will
send
for
me
and
let
me
give
you
any
help
you
may
require
you
can
scarcely
stay
in
this
house
after
the
poor
old
man
death
i
shall
go
back
to
hampshire
immediately
if
i
am
not
wanted
here
for
anything
to
make
arrangements
for
the
funeral
o
how
hard
it
seems
to
speak
of
that
while
he
is
still
living
you
need
give
yourself
no
trouble
on
that
account
i
will
see
to
all
that
if
there
is
no
more
proper
person
to
do
so
you
are
very
good
i
am
anxious
to
go
back
to
the
grange
as
quickly
as
possible
gilbert
left
soon
after
this
he
felt
that
his
presence
was
of
no
use
in
the
and
that
he
had
no
right
to
intrude
upon
marian
at
such
a
time
chapter
xxi
father
and
daughter
almost
immediately
after
gilbert
departure
another
visitor
appeared
in
the
dimly
lighted
shop
where
luke
tulliver
was
poring
over
a
newspaper
at
one
end
of
the
counter
under
a
solitary
the
was
percival
nowell
who
had
not
been
to
the
house
since
his
daughter
arrival
well
said
this
gentleman
in
his
usual
manner
how
the
governor
very
ill
going
fast
the
doctor
says
eh
as
bad
as
that
then
there
been
a
change
since
i
was
here
last
yes
nowell
was
taken
much
worse
yesterday
morning
he
had
a
kind
of
fit
i
fancy
and
could
get
his
speech
for
some
time
afterwards
but
he
got
over
that
and
has
talked
well
enough
since
then
tulliver
concluded
ruefully
remembering
his
master
candid
remarks
that
morning
i
step
upstairs
and
have
a
look
at
the
old
gentleman
said
percival
there
a
young
lady
with
him
tulliver
remarked
in
a
somewhat
mysterious
tone
a
young
lady
the
other
cried
what
young
lady
his
granddaughter
indeed
yes
she
came
up
from
the
country
yesterday
evening
and
she
been
sitting
with
him
ever
since
he
seems
to
have
taken
to
her
very
much
you
think
she
been
about
him
all
her
life
and
she
to
have
all
his
money
he
says
i
wonder
what
his
only
son
will
say
to
that
added
tulliver
looking
very
curiously
at
percival
nowell
supposing
him
to
be
alive
rather
hard
upon
him
is
it
uncommonly
the
other
answered
coolly
he
saw
that
the
shopman
suspected
his
identity
though
he
had
carefully
avoided
all
reference
to
the
relationship
between
himself
and
the
old
man
in
luke
presence
and
had
begged
his
father
to
say
nothing
about
him
i
should
like
to
see
this
young
lady
before
i
go
up
to
room
he
said
presently
will
you
step
upstairs
and
ask
her
to
come
down
to
me
i
can
go
if
you
wish
but
i
do
suppose
she
leave
the
old
gentleman
never
mind
what
you
suppose
tell
her
that
i
wish
to
say
a
few
words
to
her
upon
particular
business
luke
tulliver
departed
upon
his
errand
while
percival
nowell
went
into
the
parlour
and
seated
himself
before
the
dull
neglected
fire
in
the
lumbering
old
in
which
his
father
had
sat
through
the
long
lonely
evenings
for
so
many
years
nowell
the
younger
was
not
disturbed
by
any
sentimental
reflections
upon
this
subject
however
he
was
thinking
of
his
father
will
and
the
wrong
which
was
inflicted
upon
him
thereby
to
be
cheated
out
of
every
sixpence
by
my
own
flesh
and
blood
he
muttered
to
himself
that
seems
too
much
for
any
man
to
bear
the
door
was
opened
by
a
gentle
hand
presently
and
marian
came
into
the
room
percival
nowell
rose
from
his
seat
hastily
and
stood
facing
her
surprised
by
her
beauty
and
an
indefinable
likeness
which
she
bore
to
her
mother
a
likeness
which
brought
his
dead
wife
face
back
to
his
mind
with
a
sudden
pang
he
had
loved
her
after
his
own
fashion
once
upon
a
time
and
had
grown
weary
of
her
and
neglected
her
after
the
death
of
that
selfish
passion
but
something
some
faint
touch
of
the
old
feeling
stirred
his
heart
as
he
looked
at
his
daughter
the
emotion
was
as
brief
as
the
breath
of
a
passing
wind
in
the
next
moment
he
was
thinking
of
his
father
money
and
how
this
girl
had
emerged
from
obscurity
to
rob
him
of
it
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
on
business
i
am
told
she
said
in
her
clear
low
voice
wondering
at
the
stranger
silence
and
deliberate
scrutiny
of
her
face
yes
i
have
to
speak
to
you
on
very
serious
business
marian
he
answered
gravely
you
are
an
utter
stranger
to
me
and
yet
call
me
by
my
christian
name
i
am
not
an
utter
stranger
to
you
look
at
me
holbrook
have
you
never
seen
my
face
before
never
are
you
quite
sure
of
that
look
a
little
longer
before
you
answer
again
yes
she
cried
suddenly
after
a
long
pause
you
are
my
father
there
had
come
back
upon
her
in
a
rapid
flash
of
memory
the
picture
of
a
room
in
brussels
a
room
lighted
dimly
by
two
on
the
where
there
was
a
tall
dark
man
who
snatched
her
up
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
before
he
went
out
she
remembered
caring
very
little
for
his
kisses
and
having
a
childish
consciousness
of
the
fact
that
it
was
he
who
made
her
mamma
cry
so
often
in
the
quiet
lonely
evenings
when
the
mother
and
child
were
together
in
that
desolate
continental
lodging
yet
at
this
moment
she
was
scarcely
disposed
to
think
much
about
her
father
she
considered
only
that
he
was
her
father
and
that
they
had
found
each
other
after
long
years
of
separation
she
stretched
out
her
arms
and
would
have
fallen
upon
his
breast
but
something
in
his
manner
repelled
her
something
downcast
and
nervous
which
had
a
chilling
effect
upon
her
and
gave
her
time
to
remember
how
little
cause
she
had
to
love
him
he
did
not
seem
aware
of
the
affectionate
impulse
which
had
moved
her
towards
him
at
first
he
gave
her
his
hand
presently
it
was
deadly
cold
and
lay
loosely
in
her
own
i
was
asking
my
grandfather
about
you
this
morning
she
said
wondering
at
his
strange
manner
but
he
would
not
tell
me
where
you
were
indeed
i
am
surprised
to
find
you
felt
so
much
interest
in
me
aware
that
i
do
deserve
as
much
yet
i
could
plead
plenty
of
excuses
for
my
life
if
i
cared
to
trouble
you
with
them
but
i
do
it
would
be
a
long
story
and
when
it
was
told
you
might
not
believe
it
most
men
are
more
or
less
the
slave
of
circumstances
i
have
suffered
that
kind
of
bondage
all
my
life
i
have
known
too
that
you
were
in
good
hands
better
off
in
every
way
than
you
could
have
been
in
my
care
or
i
should
have
acted
differently
in
relation
to
you
there
is
no
occasion
to
speak
of
the
past
marian
replied
gravely
providence
was
very
good
to
me
but
i
know
my
poor
mother
last
days
were
full
of
sorrow
i
can
not
tell
how
far
it
might
have
been
in
your
power
to
prevent
that
it
is
not
my
place
to
blame
or
even
to
question
your
conduct
you
are
an
uncommonly
dutiful
daughter
nowell
exclaimed
with
rather
a
bitter
laugh
i
thought
that
you
would
have
repudiated
me
altogether
perhaps
would
have
taken
your
tone
from
my
father
who
has
grown
with
old
age
and
can
not
forgive
me
for
having
had
the
aspirations
of
a
gentleman
it
is
a
pity
there
should
not
be
union
between
my
grandfather
and
you
at
such
a
moment
as
this
marian
said
o
we
are
civil
enough
to
each
other
i
bear
no
malice
against
the
old
man
though
many
sons
in
my
position
might
consider
themselves
hardly
used
and
now
i
may
as
well
go
upstairs
and
pay
my
respects
why
is
not
your
husband
with
you
by
the
bye
he
is
not
wanted
here
and
i
do
not
even
know
that
he
is
in
london
humph
he
seems
rather
a
mysterious
sort
of
person
this
husband
of
yours
marian
took
no
notice
of
this
remark
and
the
father
and
daughter
went
upstairs
to
the
together
the
old
silversmith
received
his
son
with
obvious
coolness
and
was
evidently
displeased
at
seeing
marian
and
her
father
together
percival
nowell
however
on
his
part
appeared
to
be
in
an
unusually
affectionate
and
dutiful
mood
this
evening
he
held
his
place
by
the
bedside
resolutely
and
insisted
on
sharing
marian
watch
that
night
so
all
through
the
long
night
those
two
sat
together
while
the
old
man
passed
from
uneasy
slumber
to
more
uneasy
wakefulness
and
back
to
troubled
sleep
again
his
breathing
growing
heavier
and
more
laboured
with
every
hour
they
were
very
quiet
and
could
have
found
but
little
to
say
to
each
other
had
there
been
no
reason
for
their
silence
that
first
brief
impulsive
feeling
of
affection
past
marian
could
only
think
of
this
father
as
the
man
who
had
made
her
mother
life
lonely
and
wretched
while
he
pursued
his
own
selfish
pleasures
and
who
had
allowed
her
to
grow
to
womanhood
without
having
been
the
object
of
one
thought
or
care
upon
his
part
she
could
not
forget
these
things
as
she
sat
opposite
to
him
in
the
awful
silence
of
the
stealing
a
glance
at
his
face
now
and
then
and
wondering
at
the
strange
turn
of
fortune
which
had
brought
them
thus
together
it
was
not
a
pleasant
face
by
any
means
not
a
countenance
to
inspire
love
or
confidence
handsome
still
but
with
a
faded
look
like
a
face
that
had
grown
pallid
and
wrinkled
in
the
feverish
atmosphere
of
vicious
haunts
under
the
flaring
gas
that
glares
down
upon
the
green
cloth
of
a
table
in
the
tumult
of
crowded
the
press
and
confusion
of
the
it
was
the
face
of
a
battered
who
had
lived
his
life
and
outlived
the
smiles
of
fortune
the
face
of
a
man
to
whom
honest
thoughts
and
hopes
had
long
been
unknown
there
was
a
disappointed
peevish
look
about
the
drooping
corners
of
the
mouth
an
angry
glitter
in
the
eyes
he
did
not
look
at
his
daughter
very
often
as
they
sat
together
through
that
weary
vigil
but
kept
his
eyes
for
the
greater
part
of
the
time
upon
the
wasted
face
on
the
pillow
which
looked
like
a
parchment
mask
in
the
dim
light
he
seemed
to
be
deep
in
thought
and
several
times
in
the
night
marian
heard
him
breathe
an
impatient
sigh
as
if
his
thoughts
were
not
pleasant
to
him
more
than
once
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
paced
the
room
softly
for
a
little
time
as
if
the
restlessness
of
his
mind
had
made
that
forced
quiet
unendurable
the
early
morning
light
came
at
last
faint
and
wan
and
gray
across
a
forest
of
blackened
and
by
that
light
the
watchers
could
see
that
jacob
nowell
had
changed
for
the
worse
he
lingered
till
late
that
afternoon
it
was
growing
dusk
when
he
died
making
a
very
peaceful
end
of
life
at
the
last
with
his
head
resting
upon
marian
shoulder
and
his
cold
hand
clasped
in
hers
his
son
stood
by
the
bed
looking
down
upon
him
at
that
final
moment
with
a
fixed
inscrutable
face
gilbert
fenton
called
that
evening
and
heard
of
the
old
man
death
from
luke
tulliver
he
heard
also
that
holbrook
intended
to
sleep
in
queen
anne
court
that
night
and
did
not
therefore
intrude
upon
her
relying
upon
being
able
to
see
her
next
morning
he
left
his
card
with
a
few
words
of
condolence
written
upon
it
in
pencil
nowell
was
with
his
daughter
in
the
little
parlour
behind
the
shop
when
luke
tulliver
gave
her
this
card
he
asked
who
the
visitor
was
fenton
a
gentleman
i
knew
at
lidford
in
my
dear
uncle
lifetime
my
grandfather
liked
him
very
much
fenton
yes
my
father
told
me
all
about
him
you
were
engaged
to
him
and
jilted
him
for
this
man
you
have
married
very
foolishly
as
it
seems
to
me
for
he
could
certainly
have
given
you
a
better
position
than
that
which
you
appear
to
occupy
now
i
chose
for
my
own
happiness
marian
answered
quietly
and
i
have
only
one
subject
for
regret
that
is
that
i
was
compelled
to
act
with
ingratitude
towards
a
good
man
but
fenton
has
forgiven
me
has
promised
to
be
my
friend
if
ever
i
should
have
need
of
his
friendship
he
has
very
kindly
offered
to
take
all
trouble
off
my
hands
with
respect
to
to
the
arrangements
for
the
funeral
he
is
remarkably
obliging
said
percival
nowell
with
a
sneer
but
as
the
only
son
of
the
deceased
i
consider
myself
the
proper
person
to
perform
that
final
duty
i
do
not
wish
to
interfere
with
your
doing
so
of
course
i
did
not
know
how
near
at
hand
you
were
when
fenton
made
that
offer
or
i
should
have
told
him
you
mean
to
remain
until
the
funeral
is
over
i
suppose
i
think
not
i
want
to
go
back
to
hampshire
as
soon
as
possible
by
an
early
train
morning
if
i
can
i
do
not
see
that
there
is
any
reason
for
my
remaining
i
could
not
prove
my
respect
or
affection
for
my
grandfather
any
more
by
staying
certainly
not
her
father
answered
promptly
i
think
you
will
be
quite
right
in
getting
away
from
this
dingy
hole
as
quick
as
you
can
it
is
not
for
that
but
i
have
promised
to
return
directly
i
was
free
to
do
so
and
you
go
back
to
hampshire
to
what
part
of
hampshire
marian
told
him
the
name
of
the
place
where
she
was
living
he
wrote
the
address
in
his
and
was
especially
careful
that
it
should
be
correctly
written
as
to
the
name
of
the
nearest
town
and
in
all
other
particulars
i
may
have
to
write
to
you
or
to
come
to
you
perhaps
he
said
as
well
to
be
prepared
for
the
contingency
after
this
nowell
sent
out
for
a
railway
guide
in
order
to
give
his
daughter
all
necessary
information
about
the
trains
for
malsham
there
was
a
tolerably
fast
train
that
left
waterloo
at
seven
in
the
morning
and
marian
decided
upon
going
by
that
she
had
to
spend
the
evening
alone
with
her
father
while
mitchin
kept
watch
in
the
dismal
chamber
upstairs
nowell
asked
his
daughter
permission
to
light
his
cigar
and
having
obtained
it
sat
smoking
moodily
all
the
evening
staring
into
the
fire
and
very
rarely
addressing
his
companion
who
had
taken
a
bible
out
of
her
and
was
reading
those
solemn
chapters
which
best
harmonised
with
her
feelings
at
this
moment
thinking
as
she
read
of
the
time
when
her
guardian
and
benefactor
lay
in
his
last
calm
rest
and
she
had
vainly
tried
to
find
comfort
in
the
same
words
and
had
found
herself
staring
blankly
at
the
sacred
page
with
eyes
that
were
dry
and
burning
and
to
which
there
came
no
merciful
relief
from
tears
her
father
glanced
at
her
askance
now
and
then
from
his
by
the
fire
as
she
sat
by
the
little
round
table
looking
down
at
her
book
the
light
of
the
candles
shining
full
upon
her
pensive
face
he
looked
at
her
with
no
friendliness
in
his
eyes
but
with
that
angry
sparkle
which
had
grown
almost
habitual
to
them
of
late
since
the
world
had
gone
ill
with
him
after
one
of
those
brief
stolen
looks
a
strange
smile
crept
over
his
face
he
was
thinking
of
a
little
speech
of
shakespeare
richard
about
his
nephew
the
youthful
prince
of
wales
so
young
so
wise
they
say
do
live
long
how
pious
she
is
he
said
to
himself
with
a
diabolical
sneer
did
the
captain
teach
her
that
i
wonder
or
does
and
and
come
natural
to
all
women
i
know
my
mother
was
good
at
it
and
my
wife
too
she
used
to
fly
to
her
bible
as
a
man
flies
to
or
his
pipe
when
things
go
wrong
he
got
tired
of
his
cigar
at
last
and
went
out
into
the
shop
where
he
began
to
question
tulliver
as
to
the
extent
and
value
of
the
and
upon
other
details
of
the
business
to
all
of
which
inquiries
the
shopman
replied
in
a
suspicious
and
grudging
spirit
giving
his
questioner
the
smallest
possible
amount
of
information
you
an
uncommonly
cautious
young
man
nowell
exclaimed
at
last
you
never
stand
in
your
own
light
by
being
too
anxious
to
oblige
other
people
i
daresay
though
you
could
speak
fast
enough
if
it
was
made
worth
your
while
i
do
see
what
is
to
make
it
worth
my
while
luke
tulliver
answered
coolly
my
duty
is
to
my
dead
master
and
those
that
are
to
come
after
him
i
do
want
strangers
coming
sniffing
and
prying
into
the
stock
nowell
books
were
kept
so
that
i
could
cheat
him
out
of
a
sixpence
or
the
value
of
a
sixpence
and
i
mean
to
hand
over
to
the
lawyer
in
a
manner
that
will
do
me
credit
my
master
has
not
been
a
generous
master
to
me
considering
how
i
served
him
and
i
got
nothing
but
my
character
to
look
to
but
that
i
have
got
and
i
want
it
tampered
with
who
is
going
to
tamper
with
it
said
nowell
so
you
hand
over
the
to
the
lawyer
will
you
without
a
leaf
missing
or
an
erasure
or
an
item
marked
off
as
sold
that
never
was
sold
or
any
little
dodges
of
that
kind
eh
mr
tulliver
of
course
answered
the
shopman
looking
defiantly
at
the
questioner
who
was
leaning
across
the
counter
with
folded
arms
staring
at
luke
tulliver
with
an
ironical
grin
upon
his
countenance
then
you
are
a
very
remarkable
man
i
should
have
thought
such
a
chance
as
a
death
as
unexpected
as
my
as
old
nowell
would
have
made
the
fortune
of
a
confidential
clerk
like
you
i
not
a
thief
answered
tulliver
with
an
air
of
virtuous
indignation
and
you
ca
know
much
about
old
jacob
nowell
if
you
think
that
anybody
could
cheat
him
living
or
dead
there
not
an
entry
in
the
book
that
is
signed
with
his
initials
in
his
own
hand
when
a
thing
was
sold
and
crossed
off
the
book
he
put
his
initials
to
the
entry
of
the
sale
he
went
through
the
books
every
night
till
a
week
ago
and
as
soon
have
cut
his
own
head
off
as
omit
to
do
it
so
long
as
he
could
see
the
figures
in
the
book
or
hold
his
pen
medler
the
lawyer
came
in
while
percival
nowell
and
the
shopman
were
talking
he
had
been
away
from
his
office
upon
business
that
evening
and
had
only
just
received
the
tidings
of
the
silversmith
death
luke
tulliver
handed
him
the
books
and
keys
of
the
cases
in
which
the
tarnished
plate
was
exhibited
he
went
into
all
the
details
of
the
business
carefully
setting
his
seal
upon
books
and
papers
and
doing
all
that
he
could
to
make
matters
secure
without
hindrance
to
the
carrying
on
of
the
trade
he
was
surprised
to
hear
that
holbrook
was
in
the
house
and
proposed
paying
his
respects
to
her
that
evening
but
this
nowell
prevented
she
was
tired
and
out
of
spirits
he
told
the
attorney
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
see
her
next
day
it
was
convenient
to
nowell
to
forget
marian
intention
of
returning
to
hampshire
by
an
early
train
on
the
following
morning
at
this
juncture
when
he
went
back
to
the
parlour
after
medler
had
finished
his
business
in
the
shop
and
was
trudging
briskly
towards
his
own
residence
nowell
told
his
daughter
that
the
lawyer
had
been
there
but
did
not
inform
her
of
his
desire
to
see
her
i
suppose
you
know
all
about
your
grandfather
will
he
said
when
he
had
another
cigar
marian
had
put
away
her
book
by
this
time
and
was
looking
dreamily
at
the
fire
thinking
of
her
husband
who
need
never
know
those
weary
sordid
cares
about
money
again
now
that
she
was
to
be
rich
her
father
question
startled
her
out
of
that
agreeable
yes
she
said
my
grandfather
told
me
that
he
had
left
all
his
money
to
me
i
know
that
must
seem
unjust
to
you
papa
but
i
hope
my
husband
will
allow
me
to
do
something
towards
repairing
that
injustice
in
some
measure
in
some
measure
nowell
thought
savagely
that
means
a
pittance
that
would
serve
to
keep
life
in
a
pauper
i
suppose
and
that
is
to
be
contingent
upon
her
husband
permission
he
made
no
audible
reply
to
his
daughter
speech
and
seemed
indeed
so
much
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
that
marian
doubted
if
he
had
heard
her
and
so
the
rest
of
the
long
evening
wore
itself
out
in
dismal
silence
whilst
stealthy
footsteps
sounded
now
and
then
upon
the
stairs
later
nowell
was
summoned
to
a
conference
with
some
mysterious
person
in
the
shop
whom
marian
supposed
to
be
the
undertaker
and
returning
from
this
interview
with
a
gloomy
face
he
resumed
his
seat
by
the
fire
it
seemed
very
strange
to
marian
that
they
two
father
and
daughter
should
be
together
thus
so
near
and
yet
so
wide
apart
united
by
the
closest
tie
of
kindred
brought
together
thus
after
years
of
severance
yet
with
no
bond
of
sympathy
between
them
no
evidence
of
remorseful
tenderness
on
the
side
of
him
whose
life
had
been
one
long
neglect
of
a
father
duty
how
could
i
expect
that
he
would
care
for
me
in
the
smallest
degree
after
his
desertion
of
my
mother
marian
thought
to
herself
as
she
meditated
upon
her
father
coldness
which
at
first
had
seemed
so
strange
to
her
she
had
fancied
that
what
ever
his
sins
in
the
past
had
been
his
heart
would
have
melted
at
the
sight
of
his
only
child
she
had
thought
of
him
and
dreamed
of
him
so
often
in
her
girlhood
elevating
him
in
her
romantic
fancy
into
something
much
better
and
brighter
than
he
really
was
a
sinner
at
best
it
is
true
but
a
sinner
of
a
lofty
type
a
noble
nature
gone
astray
she
had
imagined
a
reunion
with
him
in
the
days
to
come
when
it
should
be
her
delight
to
minister
to
his
declining
years
to
be
the
consolation
of
his
repentant
soul
and
now
she
had
found
him
she
knew
these
things
could
never
be
that
there
was
not
one
feeling
of
sympathy
possible
between
her
and
that
man
of
the
world
the
dismal
evening
came
to
an
end
at
last
and
marian
bade
her
father
and
went
upstairs
to
the
little
room
where
the
traces
of
his
boyhood
had
interested
her
so
keenly
when
first
she
looked
upon
them
nowell
promised
to
come
to
queen
anne
court
at
a
quarter
past
six
next
morning
to
escort
his
daughter
to
the
station
an
act
of
parental
solicitude
she
had
not
expected
from
him
he
took
his
departure
immediately
afterwards
being
let
out
of
the
by
luke
tulliver
who
was
in
a
very
cantankerous
humour
and
took
no
pains
to
disguise
the
state
of
his
feelings
the
lawyer
medler
had
pried
into
everything
the
shopman
told
percival
nowell
had
declared
himself
empowered
to
do
this
as
the
legal
adviser
of
the
deceased
and
had
seemed
as
suspicious
as
if
he
luke
tulliver
meant
to
rob
his
dead
master
sensitive
nature
had
been
outraged
by
such
a
line
of
conduct
and
what
has
he
done
with
the
books
nowell
asked
they
all
in
the
desk
yonder
and
that
fellow
medler
has
taken
away
the
keys
sharp
practice
said
nowell
but
to
a
man
with
your
purity
of
intention
it
ca
matter
what
precautions
are
taken
to
insure
the
safety
of
the
property
of
course
it
do
matter
the
other
answered
peevishly
but
i
like
to
be
treated
as
a
gentleman
humph
and
you
expect
to
retain
your
place
here
i
suppose
if
the
business
is
carried
on
it
too
good
a
business
to
be
let
drop
replied
tulliver
but
i
should
think
that
young
lady
upstairs
would
be
much
of
a
hand
at
trade
i
would
mind
offering
a
fair
price
for
the
business
i
got
a
tidy
little
bit
of
money
put
away
though
my
salary
has
been
small
enough
goodness
knows
but
i
lived
with
the
old
gentleman
and
never
wasted
a
penny
upon
pleasure
none
of
your
or
or
anything
of
that
kind
for
me
or
i
would
mind
paying
an
annual
sum
out
of
the
profits
of
the
trade
for
a
reasonable
term
if
you
any
influence
with
the
young
lady
perhaps
you
could
put
it
to
her
and
get
her
to
look
at
things
in
that
light
tulliver
added
becoming
quite
obsequious
as
it
dawned
upon
him
that
this
interloping
stranger
might
be
able
to
do
him
a
service
i
do
my
best
for
you
tulliver
nowell
replied
in
a
patronising
tone
i
daresay
the
young
lady
will
be
quite
willing
to
entertain
any
reasonable
proposition
you
may
make
faithful
to
his
promise
nowell
appeared
at
a
quarter
past
six
next
morning
at
which
hour
he
found
his
daughter
quite
ready
for
her
journey
she
was
very
glad
to
get
away
from
that
dreary
house
made
a
hundredfold
more
dismal
by
the
sense
of
what
lay
in
the
closed
chamber
where
the
candles
were
still
burning
in
the
yellow
fog
of
the
november
morning
and
to
which
marian
had
gone
with
hushed
footsteps
to
kneel
for
the
last
time
beside
the
old
man
who
was
so
near
her
by
the
ties
of
relationship
and
whom
she
had
known
for
so
brief
a
space
she
was
glad
to
leave
that
dingy
quarter
of
the
town
which
to
one
who
had
never
lived
in
an
english
city
seemed
unspeakably
close
and
wretched
still
more
glad
to
think
that
she
was
going
back
to
the
quiet
home
where
her
husband
would
most
likely
join
her
very
soon
she
might
find
him
there
when
she
arrived
perhaps
for
he
knew
nothing
of
this
journey
to
london
or
could
only
hear
of
it
at
the
grange
where
she
had
left
a
letter
for
him
enclosing
that
brief
note
of
gilbert
fenton
which
had
informed
her
of
her
fatal
illness
there
were
special
reasons
why
she
should
not
ask
him
to
meet
her
in
queen
anne
court
however
long
she
might
have
been
compelled
to
stay
there
nowell
was
much
more
affectionate
in
his
manner
to
his
daughter
this
morning
as
they
sat
in
the
cab
driving
to
the
station
and
walked
side
by
side
upon
the
platform
in
the
quarter
of
an
hour
interval
before
the
departure
of
the
train
he
questioned
her
closely
upon
her
life
in
the
present
and
her
plans
for
the
future
expressing
himself
in
a
remarkably
generous
manner
upon
the
subject
of
her
grandfather
will
and
declaring
himself
very
well
pleased
that
his
own
involuntary
neglect
was
to
be
so
amply
atoned
for
by
the
old
man
liberality
he
found
his
daughter
completely
ignorant
of
the
world
as
gentle
and
confiding
as
he
had
found
her
mother
in
the
past
he
sounded
the
depths
of
her
innocent
mind
during
that
brief
promenade
and
when
the
train
bore
her
away
at
last
and
the
platform
was
clear
he
remained
for
some
time
walking
up
and
down
in
profound
meditation
scarcely
knowing
where
he
was
he
looked
round
him
in
an
absent
way
and
then
hurriedly
left
the
station
and
drove
straight
to
medler
office
which
was
upon
the
ground
floor
of
a
gloomy
old
house
in
one
of
the
dingier
streets
in
the
soho
district
and
in
the
upper
chambers
whereof
the
attorney
wife
and
numerous
offspring
had
their
abode
he
came
down
to
his
client
from
his
unpretending
in
a
faded
with
smears
of
egg
and
greasy
traces
of
buttered
toast
about
the
region
of
his
mouth
and
seemed
not
particularly
pleased
to
see
nowell
but
the
conference
that
followed
was
a
long
one
and
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
it
involved
some
chance
of
future
profit
since
the
lawyer
forgot
to
return
to
his
unfinished
breakfast
much
to
the
vexation
of
medler
a
faded
lady
with
everything
about
her
in
the
extremest
stage
of
limpness
who
washed
the
with
her
own
fair
hands
in
consideration
of
the
multitudinous
duties
to
be
performed
by
that
hapless
solitary
damsel
who
in
such
modest
households
is
usually
denominated
the
girl
chapter
xxii
at
lidford
again
gilbert
fenton
called
in
queen
anne
court
within
a
few
hours
of
marian
departure
and
was
not
a
little
disappointed
when
he
was
told
that
she
had
gone
back
to
hampshire
he
had
relied
upon
seeing
her
again
not
once
only
but
several
times
before
her
return
he
had
promised
jacob
nowell
that
he
would
watch
over
and
protect
her
interests
and
it
was
a
sincere
unqualified
wish
to
do
this
that
influenced
him
now
more
than
a
dear
friend
the
sweetest
and
dearest
of
all
womankind
she
could
never
be
to
him
he
accepted
the
position
with
resignation
the
first
sharp
bitterness
of
her
loss
was
over
that
he
should
ever
cease
to
love
her
was
impossible
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
chivalrous
friendship
for
her
a
disinterested
brotherly
affection
was
in
no
manner
incompatible
with
that
hapless
silent
love
no
word
of
his
in
all
their
intercourse
to
come
should
ever
remind
her
of
that
hidden
devotion
no
shadow
of
the
past
should
ever
cloud
the
calm
brightness
of
the
present
it
was
a
romantic
fancy
perhaps
for
a
man
of
business
whose
days
were
spent
in
the
very
press
and
tumult
of
commercial
life
but
it
had
lifted
gilbert
fenton
out
of
that
slough
of
despond
into
which
he
had
fallen
when
marian
seemed
utterly
lost
to
him
vanished
altogether
out
of
his
existence
he
had
a
sense
of
bitter
disappointment
therefore
when
he
found
that
she
had
gone
leaving
neither
letter
nor
message
for
him
how
little
value
his
friendship
must
needs
possess
for
her
when
she
could
abandon
him
thus
without
a
word
he
had
felt
sure
that
she
would
consult
him
upon
her
affairs
but
no
she
had
her
husband
to
whom
to
appeal
and
had
no
need
of
any
other
counsellor
i
was
a
fool
to
think
that
i
could
ever
be
anything
to
her
even
a
friend
he
said
to
himself
bitterly
women
are
incapable
of
friendship
it
is
all
or
nothing
with
them
a
blind
or
the
coldest
indifference
devotion
can
not
touch
them
unless
the
man
who
gives
it
happen
to
be
that
one
man
out
of
a
thousand
who
has
the
power
to
bewitch
their
senses
truth
and
affection
of
themselves
have
no
value
with
them
how
many
people
spoke
to
me
of
this
holbrook
as
an
unattractive
man
and
yet
he
won
my
love
away
from
me
and
holds
her
with
an
influence
so
complete
that
my
friendship
seems
worthless
to
her
she
can
not
give
me
a
word
or
a
thought
fenton
made
some
inquiries
about
the
funeral
arrangements
and
found
that
these
had
been
duly
attended
to
by
the
lawyer
and
a
gentleman
who
had
been
with
jacob
nowell
a
good
deal
of
late
who
seemed
to
be
some
relation
to
the
old
man
tulliver
said
and
took
a
great
deal
upon
himself
this
being
done
there
was
of
course
no
occasion
for
gilbert
to
interfere
and
he
was
glad
to
be
released
from
all
responsibility
having
ascertained
this
he
asked
for
the
address
of
the
late
nowell
lawyer
and
being
told
it
went
at
once
to
medler
office
he
did
not
consider
himself
absolved
from
the
promise
he
had
made
the
old
man
by
marian
indifference
and
was
none
the
less
anxious
to
watch
over
her
interests
because
she
seemed
to
set
so
little
value
on
his
friendship
he
told
medler
who
he
was
and
the
promise
he
had
given
to
jacob
nowell
abstaining
of
course
from
any
reference
to
the
position
he
had
once
occupied
towards
marian
he
described
himself
as
her
friend
only
a
friend
of
long
standing
who
had
been
intimate
with
her
adopted
guardian
i
know
how
ignorant
holbrook
is
of
the
world
and
of
all
business
matters
he
went
on
to
say
and
i
am
naturally
anxious
that
her
interests
should
be
protected
i
should
think
there
was
very
little
doubt
that
her
husband
will
see
after
those
the
lawyer
answered
with
something
of
a
sneer
husbands
are
generally
supposed
to
do
that
especially
where
there
is
money
at
stake
i
do
not
know
holbrook
and
he
has
kept
himself
in
the
background
so
persistently
up
to
this
point
and
has
been
altogether
so
underhanded
in
his
proceedings
that
i
have
by
no
means
a
good
opinion
of
him
nowell
told
me
that
he
intended
to
leave
his
money
to
his
granddaughter
in
such
a
manner
that
it
would
be
hers
and
hers
only
free
from
the
control
of
any
husband
he
has
done
so
i
presume
yes
medler
replied
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
would
fain
have
withheld
the
information
he
has
left
it
for
her
own
separate
use
and
maintenance
and
it
is
a
property
of
some
importance
i
conclude
of
some
importance
yes
the
lawyer
answered
in
the
same
tone
ought
not
holbrook
to
have
remained
to
hear
the
reading
of
the
will
well
yes
decidedly
it
would
have
been
more
in
the
usual
way
of
things
but
her
absence
can
have
no
ill
effect
upon
her
interests
of
course
it
will
be
my
duty
to
make
her
acquainted
with
the
contents
of
the
will
gilbert
fenton
was
not
prepossessed
by
medler
countenance
which
was
not
an
open
candid
index
to
a
spotless
soul
nor
by
his
surroundings
which
were
of
the
shabbiest
but
the
business
being
in
this
man
hands
it
might
be
rather
difficult
to
withdraw
it
dangerous
even
the
man
held
the
will
and
in
holding
that
had
a
certain
amount
of
power
there
is
no
one
except
holbrook
interested
in
nowell
will
i
suppose
gilbert
said
presently
no
one
directly
and
immediately
except
an
old
charwoman
who
has
a
legacy
of
pounds
but
there
is
some
one
else
interested
in
an
indirect
manner
i
infer
from
your
words
yes
holbrook
takes
the
whole
of
the
personalty
but
she
has
only
a
in
the
real
estate
if
she
should
have
children
it
will
go
to
them
on
her
death
if
she
should
die
childless
it
will
go
to
her
father
supposing
him
to
survive
her
to
her
father
that
is
rather
strange
is
it
i
do
know
that
it
was
the
old
man
wish
that
the
will
should
be
to
that
effect
i
understood
from
him
that
he
did
not
know
whether
his
son
was
alive
or
dead
indeed
i
believe
he
had
news
of
his
son
very
lately
curious
that
he
should
not
have
told
me
knowing
as
he
did
my
interest
in
everything
relating
to
mrs
holbrook
old
people
are
apt
to
be
close
and
jacob
nowell
was
about
one
of
the
closest
customers
i
ever
met
with
answered
the
lawyer
gilbert
left
him
soon
after
this
and
chartered
a
hansom
in
the
next
street
which
carried
him
back
to
the
city
he
was
very
uncertain
as
to
what
he
ought
to
do
for
marian
doubtful
of
medler
integrity
and
yet
anxious
to
abstain
from
any
act
that
might
seem
uncalled
for
or
officious
she
had
her
husband
to
look
after
her
interests
as
the
lawyer
had
reminded
him
and
it
was
scarcely
probable
that
holbrook
would
neglect
any
steps
necessary
to
secure
his
wife
succession
to
whatever
property
jacob
nowell
had
left
it
seemed
to
gilbert
that
he
could
do
nothing
at
present
except
write
to
marian
telling
her
of
his
interview
with
the
lawyer
and
advising
her
to
lose
no
time
in
placing
the
conduct
of
her
affairs
in
more
respectable
hands
than
those
of
medler
he
mentioned
his
own
solicitors
a
city
firm
of
high
standing
as
gentlemen
whom
she
might
wisely
trust
at
this
crisis
of
her
life
this
done
he
could
only
wait
the
issue
of
events
and
he
tried
to
occupy
himself
as
much
as
possible
with
his
business
at
helens
that
business
which
he
seriously
intended
getting
rid
of
as
soon
as
he
could
meet
with
a
favourable
opportunity
for
so
doing
he
worked
with
that
object
in
view
in
spite
of
his
losses
in
australia
he
was
in
a
position
to
retire
from
commerce
with
a
very
fair
income
he
had
lost
all
motive
for
sustained
exertion
all
desire
to
become
rich
a
man
who
has
no
taste
for
expensive
bachelor
pleasures
and
no
home
has
very
little
opportunity
for
getting
rid
of
large
sums
of
money
fenton
had
taken
life
pleasantly
enough
and
yet
had
never
spent
five
hundred
a
year
he
could
retire
with
an
income
of
eight
hundred
and
having
abandoned
all
idea
of
ever
marrying
this
seemed
to
him
more
than
sufficient
the
listers
had
come
back
to
england
and
lister
had
written
to
her
brother
more
than
once
begging
him
to
run
down
to
lidford
of
course
she
had
expressed
herself
freely
upon
the
subject
of
marian
conduct
in
these
letters
reprobating
the
girl
treachery
and
ingratitude
and
congratulating
gilbert
upon
his
escape
from
so
ineligible
a
connection
fenton
had
put
his
sister
off
with
excuses
hitherto
and
had
subjected
himself
thereby
to
sundry
feminine
reproaches
upon
his
coldness
and
want
of
affection
for
lister
and
her
children
it
was
very
different
when
marian
nowell
was
here
she
wrote
you
thought
it
no
trouble
to
come
to
us
then
no
answer
came
to
his
letter
to
holbrook
which
scarcely
called
for
a
reply
unless
it
had
been
a
few
lines
of
thanks
in
acknowledgment
of
his
interest
in
her
behalf
he
had
looked
for
such
a
letter
and
was
a
little
disappointed
by
its
the
omission
slight
as
it
was
served
to
strengthen
his
bitter
feeling
that
his
friendship
in
this
quarter
was
unneeded
and
unvalued
business
in
the
city
happened
to
be
rather
slack
at
this
time
and
it
struck
fenton
all
at
once
that
he
could
scarcely
have
a
better
opportunity
for
wasting
two
or
three
days
in
a
visit
of
duty
to
the
listers
and
putting
an
end
to
his
sister
reproachful
letters
he
had
a
second
motive
for
going
to
lidford
a
motive
which
had
far
greater
weight
with
him
than
his
brotherly
affection
just
at
this
time
he
wanted
to
see
sir
david
forster
to
call
that
gentleman
to
some
account
for
the
deliberate
falsehood
he
had
uttered
at
their
last
meeting
he
had
no
bloodthirsty
or
ferocious
feelings
upon
the
subject
he
could
even
understand
that
the
baronet
might
have
been
bound
by
his
own
ideas
of
honour
to
tell
a
lie
in
the
service
of
his
friend
but
he
wanted
to
extort
some
explanation
of
the
line
of
conduct
sir
david
had
taken
and
he
wanted
to
ascertain
from
him
the
character
of
marian
husband
he
had
made
inquiries
about
sir
david
at
the
club
and
had
been
told
that
he
was
still
at
heatherly
he
went
down
to
lidford
by
an
afternoon
train
without
having
troubled
himself
to
give
lister
any
notice
of
his
coming
the
november
evening
had
closed
in
upon
the
quiet
rural
landscape
when
he
drove
from
the
station
to
lidford
a
cold
white
mist
enfolded
all
things
here
instead
of
the
stifling
yellow
fog
that
had
filled
the
london
streets
when
he
walked
westwards
from
the
city
at
the
same
hour
on
the
previous
evening
above
his
head
the
sky
was
clear
and
bright
the
melting
away
as
they
mounted
towards
the
stars
the
lighted
windows
in
the
village
street
had
a
pleasant
homely
look
the
snug
villas
lying
back
from
the
high
road
with
a
middle
distance
of
dark
lawn
and
glistening
shrubbery
shone
brightly
upon
the
traveller
as
he
drove
by
the
curtains
not
yet
drawn
before
some
of
the
windows
the
rooms
ruddy
in
the
firelight
in
one
of
them
he
caught
a
brief
glimpse
of
a
young
matron
seated
by
the
fire
with
her
children
clustered
at
her
knee
and
the
transient
picture
struck
him
with
a
sudden
pang
he
had
dreamed
so
fondly
of
a
home
like
this
pleasant
rooms
shining
in
the
sacred
light
of
the
hearth
his
wife
and
children
waiting
to
bid
him
welcome
when
the
day
work
was
done
all
other
objects
which
men
live
and
toil
for
seemed
to
him
poor
and
worthless
in
the
absence
of
this
one
dear
incentive
to
exertion
this
one
sweet
recompense
for
every
care
even
lidford
house
which
had
never
before
seemed
to
him
the
perfection
of
a
home
had
a
new
aspect
for
him
and
reminded
him
sharply
of
his
own
loss
he
envied
martin
lister
the
quiet
happiness
of
his
domestic
life
his
love
for
and
pride
in
his
children
the
calm
haven
of
that
comfortable
hearth
by
which
he
sat
with
his
slippered
feet
stretched
luxuriously
upon
a
of
his
wife
manufacture
and
his
daughter
sitting
on
a
hassock
close
to
his
reading
in
a
book
of
fairy
tales
of
course
they
were
all
delighted
to
see
him
at
once
pleased
and
surprised
by
the
unexpected
visit
he
had
brought
a
great
parcel
of
toys
for
the
two
children
and
selwyn
lister
a
fine
boisterous
boy
in
a
highland
costume
was
summoned
downstairs
to
assist
at
the
unpacking
of
these
treasures
it
was
seven
and
the
listers
had
dined
at
six
but
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
the
sutherland
table
had
been
drawn
out
to
a
cosy
position
near
the
fire
and
spread
with
a
substantial
repast
while
lister
took
her
place
behind
the
ponderous
old
silver
urn
which
had
been
an
heirloom
in
her
husband
family
for
the
last
two
centuries
the
listers
were
full
of
talk
about
their
own
travels
a
continental
tour
which
had
been
talked
of
ever
since
their
return
from
the
honeymoon
trip
to
geneva
and
chamouni
and
were
also
very
eager
to
hear
gilbert
adventures
in
australia
of
which
he
had
given
them
only
very
brief
accounts
in
his
letters
there
was
nothing
said
that
night
about
marian
and
gilbert
was
grateful
for
his
sister
forbearance
chapter
xxiii
called
to
account
gilbert
walked
over
to
heatherly
after
luncheon
next
day
taking
of
preference
the
way
which
led
him
past
captain
sedgewick
cottage
and
through
the
leafless
wood
where
he
and
marian
had
walked
together
when
the
foliage
was
in
its
summer
glory
the
leaves
lay
thick
upon
the
mossy
ground
now
and
the
gaunt
bare
branches
of
the
trees
had
a
weird
awful
look
in
the
utter
silence
of
the
place
his
footsteps
trampling
upon
the
fallen
leaves
had
an
echo
and
he
turned
to
look
behind
him
more
than
once
fancying
he
was
followed
the
old
house
with
its
long
lines
of
windows
had
a
aspect
under
the
dull
november
day
gilbert
wondered
how
such
a
man
as
sir
david
forster
could
endure
his
existence
there
embittered
as
it
was
by
the
memory
of
that
calamity
which
had
taken
all
the
sunlight
out
of
his
life
and
left
him
a
weary
and
purposeless
hunter
after
pleasure
but
sir
david
had
been
prostrate
under
the
heavy
hand
of
his
hereditary
foe
the
gout
for
a
long
time
past
and
was
fain
to
content
himself
with
such
company
as
came
to
him
at
heatherly
and
such
amusement
as
was
to
be
found
in
the
society
of
men
who
were
boon
companions
rather
than
friends
gilbert
fenton
heard
the
familiar
clash
of
the
as
he
went
into
the
hall
where
a
couple
of
setters
were
dozing
before
a
great
fire
that
roared
up
the
wide
chimney
there
was
no
other
life
in
the
hall
and
fenton
was
conducted
to
the
other
end
of
the
house
and
ushered
into
that
snuggery
in
which
he
had
last
seen
the
baronet
his
suspicions
were
on
the
alert
this
time
and
he
fancied
he
could
detect
a
look
of
something
more
than
surprise
in
sir
david
face
when
the
servant
announced
him
an
uneasy
look
as
of
a
man
taken
at
a
disadvantage
the
baronet
was
very
gracious
however
and
gave
him
a
hearty
welcome
i
uncommonly
glad
to
see
you
my
dear
fenton
he
said
indeed
i
have
been
pleased
to
see
worse
fellows
than
you
lately
since
this
infernal
gout
has
laid
me
up
in
this
dreary
old
place
the
house
is
pretty
full
now
i
am
happy
to
say
i
have
friends
who
will
come
to
shoot
my
partridges
though
they
wo
remember
my
solitude
in
a
charitable
spirit
before
the
first
of
september
you
stop
and
dine
i
hope
or
perhaps
you
can
put
up
here
altogether
for
a
week
or
so
my
housekeeper
shall
find
you
a
good
room
and
i
can
promise
you
pleasant
company
say
yes
now
like
a
good
fellow
and
i
send
a
man
to
lidford
for
your
traps
thanks
no
you
are
very
kind
but
i
am
staying
with
my
sister
for
a
few
days
and
must
return
to
town
before
the
end
of
the
week
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
sir
david
i
have
come
here
to
ask
you
for
some
explanation
of
your
conduct
at
our
last
interview
i
do
want
to
say
anything
rude
or
disagreeable
for
i
am
quite
willing
to
believe
that
you
felt
kindly
towards
me
even
at
the
time
when
you
deceived
me
i
suppose
there
are
some
positions
in
which
a
man
can
hardly
expect
fair
play
and
that
mine
was
such
a
position
but
you
certainly
did
deceive
me
sir
david
and
grossly
that
last
is
rather
an
unpleasant
word
fenton
in
what
respect
did
i
deceive
you
i
came
here
on
purpose
to
ask
you
if
holbrook
the
man
who
robbed
me
of
my
promised
wife
were
a
friend
of
yours
and
you
denied
all
knowledge
of
him
granted
and
what
then
my
dear
sir
when
i
came
to
ask
you
that
question
i
had
no
special
reason
for
supposing
this
holbrook
was
known
to
you
it
only
struck
me
that
being
a
stranger
in
the
village
as
the
result
of
my
inquiries
had
proved
to
me
he
might
be
one
of
your
many
visitors
i
knew
at
that
time
that
holbrook
had
taken
his
wife
to
a
in
hampshire
immediately
after
their
marriage
a
house
lent
to
him
by
a
friend
but
i
did
not
know
that
you
had
any
estate
in
that
county
i
have
been
to
hampshire
since
then
and
have
found
holbrook
at
the
grange
near
crosber
in
your
house
you
have
found
her
well
fenton
the
circumstantial
evidence
is
too
strong
for
me
so
i
must
plead
guilty
yes
i
did
deceive
you
when
i
told
you
that
holbrook
was
unknown
to
me
but
i
pledged
my
word
to
keep
his
secret
to
give
you
no
clue
should
you
ever
happen
to
question
me
that
could
lead
to
your
discovery
of
your
lost
love
whereabouts
it
was
considered
i
conclude
that
any
meeting
between
you
two
must
needs
result
unpleasantly
at
any
rate
there
was
a
strong
desire
to
avoid
you
and
in
common
duty
to
my
friend
i
was
compelled
to
respect
that
desire
not
a
very
manly
wish
on
the
part
of
my
successful
rival
said
gilbert
it
may
have
been
the
lady
wish
rather
than
mr
holbrook
i
have
reason
to
know
that
it
was
otherwise
i
have
heard
from
own
lips
that
she
would
have
written
a
candid
confession
of
the
truth
had
she
been
free
to
do
so
it
was
her
husband
who
prevented
her
giving
me
notice
of
my
desertion
i
can
not
pretend
to
explain
his
conduct
sir
david
answered
gravely
i
only
know
that
i
pledged
myself
to
keep
his
secret
and
felt
bound
to
do
so
even
at
the
cost
of
a
lie
and
this
man
is
your
friend
you
must
know
whether
he
is
worthy
to
be
marian
nowell
husband
the
circumstances
of
her
life
do
not
seem
to
me
favourable
to
happiness
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
discover
them
nor
did
i
think
her
looking
happy
when
we
met
but
i
should
be
glad
to
know
that
she
has
not
fallen
into
bad
hands
and
i
suppose
by
this
time
your
feelings
have
cooled
down
a
little
you
have
abandoned
those
revengeful
intentions
you
appeared
to
entertain
when
you
were
last
in
this
house
in
a
great
measure
yes
i
have
promised
marian
that
should
i
and
her
husband
meet
as
we
must
do
i
believe
sooner
or
later
she
need
apprehend
no
violence
on
my
part
he
has
won
the
prize
any
open
resentment
would
seem
mere
schoolboy
folly
but
you
can
not
suppose
that
i
feel
very
kindly
towards
him
or
ever
shall
upon
my
soul
i
think
men
are
hardly
responsible
for
their
actions
where
a
woman
is
concerned
sir
david
exclaimed
after
a
pause
we
are
the
veriest
slaves
of
destiny
in
these
matters
a
man
sees
the
only
woman
in
the
world
he
can
love
too
late
to
win
her
with
honour
if
he
is
strong
enough
to
act
nobly
he
turns
his
back
upon
the
scene
of
his
temptation
all
the
more
easily
should
the
lady
happen
to
be
staunch
to
her
affianced
or
her
husband
as
the
case
may
be
but
if
waver
if
he
sees
that
his
love
is
returned
heaven
help
him
honour
generosity
friendship
all
go
by
the
board
and
for
the
light
in
those
fatal
eyes
for
the
dangerous
music
of
that
one
dear
voice
he
sacrifices
all
that
he
has
held
highest
in
life
until
that
luckless
time
i
that
holbrook
held
it
no
light
thing
to
do
you
this
wrong
i
know
that
he
fought
manfully
against
temptation
but
you
see
fate
was
the
stronger
and
he
had
to
give
way
at
the
last
i
can
not
agree
with
that
way
of
looking
at
things
sir
david
the
world
is
made
up
of
people
who
take
their
own
pleasure
at
any
cost
to
others
and
then
throw
the
onus
of
their
misdoings
upon
providence
i
have
long
ago
forgiven
the
girl
who
jilted
me
and
have
sworn
to
be
her
faithful
and
watchful
friend
in
all
the
days
to
come
i
want
to
be
sure
that
her
future
is
a
bright
one
much
brighter
than
it
seemed
when
i
saw
her
in
your
lonely
old
house
near
crosber
she
has
had
money
left
her
since
then
so
poverty
can
no
longer
be
a
reason
for
her
being
hidden
from
the
world
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
that
my
friend
is
not
a
rich
man
so
marian
told
me
but
i
want
to
learn
something
more
than
that
about
him
up
to
this
moment
he
has
been
the
most
intangible
being
i
ever
heard
of
will
you
tell
me
who
and
what
he
is
his
position
in
the
world
and
so
on
humph
muttered
sir
david
meditatively
i
do
know
that
i
can
tell
you
much
about
him
his
position
is
like
that
of
a
good
many
others
of
my
acquaintance
rather
vague
and
intangible
to
use
the
word
you
employed
just
now
he
is
not
well
off
he
is
a
gentleman
by
birth
with
some
small
means
of
his
own
and
he
sir
lives
that
is
about
all
i
can
say
of
him
from
a
worldly
point
of
view
with
regard
to
his
affection
for
miss
nowell
i
know
that
he
loved
her
passionately
devotedly
desperately
the
strongest
expression
you
can
supply
to
describe
a
folly
i
never
saw
any
fellow
so
far
gone
heaven
knows
i
did
my
best
to
argue
him
out
of
his
fancy
urged
your
claim
the
girl
poverty
every
reason
against
the
marriage
but
friendly
argumentation
of
that
kind
goes
very
little
way
in
such
a
case
he
took
his
own
course
it
was
only
when
i
found
the
business
was
decided
upon
that
i
offered
him
my
house
in
hampshire
a
place
to
which
i
never
go
myself
but
which
brings
me
in
a
decent
income
in
the
hands
of
a
clever
bailiff
i
knew
that
holbrook
had
no
home
ready
for
his
wife
and
i
thought
it
would
give
them
a
pleasant
retreat
enough
for
a
few
months
while
the
honey
and
still
sweetened
the
of
their
wedded
life
they
have
stayed
there
ever
since
as
you
seem
to
know
so
i
conclude
they
have
found
the
place
agreeable
confoundedly
dreary
i
should
fancy
it
myself
but
then
not
a
newly
married
man
the
baronet
gave
a
brief
sigh
and
his
thoughts
went
back
for
a
moment
to
the
time
when
he
too
was
in
arcadia
when
a
fair
young
wife
was
by
his
side
and
when
no
hour
of
his
existence
seemed
ever
dull
or
weary
to
him
it
was
all
changed
now
he
had
billiards
and
whist
and
horses
and
hounds
and
a
vast
collection
of
gunnery
and
great
stores
of
wine
in
the
gloomy
arched
vaults
beneath
the
house
where
a
hundred
prisoners
had
been
kept
under
lock
and
key
when
heatherly
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
cromwellian
soldiery
and
the
faithful
retainers
of
the
household
were
fain
to
lay
down
their
arms
he
had
all
things
that
make
up
the
common
pleasures
and
delights
of
a
man
existence
but
he
had
lost
the
love
which
had
given
these
things
a
new
charm
and
without
which
all
life
seemed
to
him
flat
stale
and
unprofitable
he
could
sympathise
with
gilbert
fenton
much
more
keenly
than
that
gentleman
would
have
supposed
possible
for
a
man
suffering
from
this
kind
of
affliction
is
apt
to
imagine
that
he
has
a
copyright
in
that
species
of
grief
and
that
no
other
man
ever
did
or
ever
can
experience
a
like
calamity
the
same
manner
of
trouble
may
come
to
others
of
course
but
not
with
a
similar
intensity
others
will
suffer
and
recover
and
find
a
balm
elsewhere
he
alone
is
constant
until
death
and
you
can
tell
me
nothing
more
about
mr
holbrook
he
asked
after
a
pause
upon
my
honour
nothing
i
think
you
will
do
wisely
to
leave
these
two
people
to
take
their
own
way
in
the
future
without
any
interference
on
your
part
you
speak
of
watchful
friendship
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
and
i
can
quite
appreciate
your
disinterested
desire
to
befriend
the
woman
whom
you
once
hoped
to
make
your
wife
but
believe
me
my
dear
fenton
no
manner
of
good
can
possibly
come
of
your
intervention
those
two
have
chosen
their
road
in
life
and
must
travel
along
it
side
by
side
through
good
or
evil
fortune
holbrook
would
naturally
be
jealous
of
any
friendship
between
his
wife
and
you
while
such
a
friendship
could
not
fail
to
keep
alive
bitter
thoughts
in
your
mind
could
not
fail
to
sharpen
the
regret
which
you
fancy
just
now
is
to
be
i
have
no
doubt
i
seem
to
speak
in
a
hard
worldly
spirit
you
speak
like
a
man
of
the
world
sir
david
the
other
answered
quietly
and
i
can
not
deny
that
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
wisdom
in
your
advice
no
my
friendship
is
not
wanted
by
either
of
those
two
supposing
even
that
i
were
generous
enough
to
be
able
to
give
it
to
both
i
have
learnt
that
lesson
already
from
marian
herself
but
you
must
remember
that
i
promised
her
poor
old
grandfather
the
man
who
died
a
few
days
ago
that
i
would
watch
over
her
interests
with
patient
fidelity
that
i
would
be
her
friend
and
protector
if
ever
the
hour
should
come
in
which
she
would
need
friendship
and
protection
i
am
not
going
to
forget
this
promise
or
to
neglect
its
performance
and
in
order
to
be
true
to
my
word
i
am
bound
to
make
myself
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
of
her
married
life
and
the
character
of
her
husband
can
not
you
be
satisfied
with
knowing
that
she
is
happy
i
have
seen
her
sir
david
and
am
by
no
means
assured
of
her
happiness
and
yet
it
was
a
on
both
sides
holbrook
as
i
have
told
you
loved
her
passionately
that
passionate
kind
of
love
is
apt
to
wear
itself
out
very
quickly
with
some
men
your
bailiff
daughter
complained
bitterly
of
frequent
absence
from
the
grange
of
the
dulness
and
loneliness
of
my
poor
girl
life
women
are
apt
to
be
exacting
sir
david
answered
with
a
deprecating
shrug
of
the
shoulders
my
friend
holbrook
has
the
battle
of
life
to
fight
and
could
not
spend
all
his
days
playing
the
lover
if
his
wife
has
had
money
left
her
that
will
make
some
difference
in
their
position
a
man
is
never
at
his
best
when
he
is
worried
by
debts
and
financial
difficulties
and
holbrook
was
in
debt
when
he
married
i
suppose
he
was
i
must
confess
that
i
find
that
complaint
a
very
common
one
among
my
acquaintance
the
baronet
added
with
a
laugh
will
you
tell
me
what
this
holbrook
is
like
in
person
sir
david
i
have
questioned
several
people
about
him
and
have
never
obtained
anything
beyond
the
vaguest
kind
of
description
sir
david
forster
laughed
aloud
at
this
request
what
you
want
to
know
whether
your
rival
is
handsome
i
suppose
like
a
woman
who
always
commences
her
inquiries
about
another
woman
by
asking
whether
she
is
pretty
my
dear
fenton
all
personal
descriptions
are
vague
it
is
almost
impossible
to
furnish
a
correct
catalogue
of
any
man
features
holbrook
is
just
one
of
those
men
whom
it
is
most
difficult
to
describe
not
particularly
nor
especially
very
clever
and
with
plenty
of
expression
and
character
in
his
face
older
than
you
by
some
years
and
looking
older
than
he
really
is
thanks
but
there
is
not
one
precise
statement
in
your
description
is
the
man
dark
or
fair
short
or
tall
rather
dark
than
fair
rather
tall
than
short
that
will
do
sir
david
gilbert
said
starting
suddenly
to
his
feet
and
looking
the
baronet
in
the
face
intently
the
man
who
robbed
me
of
my
promised
wife
is
the
man
whom
i
introduced
to
her
the
man
who
has
come
between
me
and
all
my
hopes
who
hides
himself
from
my
just
anger
and
skulks
in
the
background
under
a
feigned
name
is
the
one
friend
whom
i
have
loved
above
all
other
men
john
saltram
sir
david
faced
him
without
flinching
if
it
was
acted
surprise
which
appeared
upon
his
countenance
at
the
sound
of
john
saltram
name
the
acting
was
perfect
gilbert
could
discover
nothing
from
that
broad
stare
of
blank
amazement
in
heaven
name
what
can
have
put
such
a
preposterous
notion
into
your
head
sir
david
asked
coolly
i
can
not
tell
you
the
conviction
has
grown
upon
me
against
my
own
will
yes
i
have
hated
myself
for
being
able
to
suspect
my
friend
you
do
not
know
how
i
have
loved
that
man
or
how
our
friendship
began
at
oxford
long
ago
with
something
like
on
my
side
i
thought
that
he
was
born
to
be
great
and
noble
and
heaven
knows
i
have
felt
the
disappointments
and
shortcomings
of
his
career
more
keenly
than
he
has
felt
them
himself
no
sir
david
i
do
think
it
is
possible
for
any
man
to
comprehend
how
i
have
loved
john
saltram
and
yet
without
a
shred
of
evidence
you
believe
him
guilty
of
betraying
you
will
you
give
me
your
word
of
honour
that
marian
husband
and
john
saltram
are
not
one
and
the
same
person
no
answered
sir
david
impatiently
i
am
tired
of
the
whole
business
you
have
questioned
and
me
quite
long
enough
fenton
and
i
have
answered
you
to
the
best
of
my
ability
and
have
given
you
rational
advice
which
you
will
of
course
decline
to
take
if
you
think
your
friend
has
wronged
you
go
to
him
and
tax
him
with
that
wrong
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
affair
altogether
from
this
moment
but
without
wishing
to
be
offensive
i
can
not
help
telling
you
that
to
my
mind
you
are
acting
very
foolishly
in
this
business
i
daresay
it
may
seem
so
to
you
you
would
think
better
of
me
if
i
could
play
the
stoic
and
say
has
jilted
me
and
is
dead
to
me
henceforward
but
i
can
not
do
that
i
have
the
memory
of
her
peaceful
girlhood
the
happy
days
in
which
i
knew
her
first
the
generous
protector
who
sheltered
her
life
i
am
pledged
to
the
dead
sir
david
he
left
heatherly
soon
after
this
though
the
baronet
pressed
him
to
stay
to
dinner
chapter
xxiv
tormented
by
doubt
the
long
homeward
walk
gave
gilbert
ample
leisure
for
reflection
upon
his
interview
with
sir
david
a
very
unsatisfactory
interview
at
the
best
yes
the
conviction
that
the
man
who
had
wronged
him
was
no
other
than
his
own
familiar
friend
had
flashed
upon
him
with
a
new
force
as
the
baronet
answered
his
questions
about
john
holbrook
the
suspicion
which
had
entered
his
mind
after
he
left
the
lonely
near
crosber
and
which
he
had
done
his
uttermost
to
banish
as
if
it
had
been
a
suggestion
of
the
evil
one
came
back
to
him
with
a
form
and
reality
which
it
had
lacked
before
it
seemed
no
longer
a
vague
fancy
a
dark
unwelcome
thought
that
bordered
on
folly
it
had
taken
a
new
shape
altogether
and
appeared
to
him
almost
a
certainty
sir
david
refusal
to
make
any
direct
denial
of
the
fact
seemed
to
confirm
his
suspicion
yet
it
was
on
the
other
hand
just
possible
that
sir
david
finding
him
on
a
false
scent
should
have
been
willing
to
let
him
follow
it
and
that
the
real
offender
should
be
screened
by
this
suspicion
of
john
saltram
but
then
there
arose
in
his
mind
a
doubt
that
had
perplexed
him
sorely
for
a
long
time
if
his
successful
rival
had
been
indeed
a
stranger
to
him
what
reason
could
there
be
for
so
much
mystery
in
the
circumstances
of
the
marriage
and
why
should
marian
have
so
carefully
avoided
telling
him
anything
about
her
husband
that
his
friend
having
betrayed
him
should
shrink
from
the
revelation
of
his
falsehood
should
adopt
any
underhand
course
to
avoid
discovery
seemed
natural
enough
yet
to
believe
this
was
to
think
meanly
of
the
man
whom
he
had
loved
so
well
whom
he
had
confided
in
so
implicitly
until
the
arising
of
this
cruel
doubt
he
had
known
long
ago
when
the
first
freshness
of
his
boyish
delusions
faded
away
before
the
penetrating
clear
daylight
of
reality
he
had
known
long
ago
that
his
friend
was
not
faultless
that
except
in
that
one
faithful
alliance
with
himself
john
saltram
had
been
fickle
wayward
vacillating
unstable
and
inconstant
true
to
no
dream
of
his
youth
no
ambition
of
his
early
manhood
content
to
drop
one
purpose
after
another
until
his
life
was
left
without
any
exalted
aim
but
gilbert
had
fancied
his
friend
nature
was
still
a
noble
one
in
spite
of
the
comparative
failure
of
his
life
it
was
very
difficult
for
him
to
imagine
it
possible
that
this
friend
could
act
falsely
and
ungenerously
could
steal
his
betrothed
from
him
and
keep
the
secret
of
his
guilt
pretending
to
sympathise
with
the
jilted
lover
all
the
while
but
though
fenton
told
himself
at
one
moment
that
this
was
impossible
his
thoughts
travelled
back
to
the
same
point
immediately
afterwards
and
the
image
of
john
saltram
arose
before
him
as
that
of
his
hidden
foe
he
remembered
the
long
autumn
days
which
he
and
his
friend
had
spent
with
marian
those
unclouded
utterly
happy
days
which
he
looked
back
upon
now
with
a
kind
of
wonder
they
had
been
so
much
together
marian
so
bright
and
fascinating
in
her
innocent
enjoyment
of
the
present
brighter
and
happier
just
then
than
she
had
ever
seemed
to
him
before
gilbert
remembered
with
a
bitter
pang
he
had
been
completely
unsuspicious
at
the
time
untroubled
by
one
doubtful
thought
but
it
appeared
to
him
now
that
there
had
been
a
change
in
marian
from
the
time
of
his
friend
coming
a
new
joyousness
and
vivacity
a
keener
delight
in
the
simple
pleasures
of
their
daily
life
and
withal
a
fitfulness
a
tendency
to
change
from
gaiety
to
thoughtful
silence
that
he
had
not
remarked
in
her
before
was
it
strange
if
john
saltram
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
was
it
possible
to
see
her
daily
in
all
the
glory
of
her
girlish
loveliness
made
doubly
bewitching
by
the
sweetness
of
her
nature
the
indescribable
charm
of
her
manner
was
it
possible
to
be
with
her
often
as
john
saltram
had
been
and
not
love
her
gilbert
fenton
had
thought
of
his
friend
as
utterly
impregnable
to
any
such
danger
as
a
man
who
had
spent
all
his
stock
of
tender
emotion
long
ago
and
who
looked
upon
matrimony
as
a
transaction
by
which
he
might
mend
his
broken
fortunes
that
this
man
should
fall
a
victim
to
the
same
subtle
charm
which
had
subjugated
himself
was
a
possibility
that
never
occurred
to
gilbert
mind
in
this
happy
period
of
his
existence
he
wanted
his
friend
approval
of
his
choice
he
wished
to
see
his
passion
justified
in
the
eyes
of
the
man
whom
it
was
his
habit
to
regard
in
somewise
as
a
superior
creature
and
it
had
been
a
real
delight
to
him
to
hear
saltram
warm
praises
of
marian
looking
back
at
the
past
from
a
new
point
of
view
he
wondered
at
his
own
folly
what
was
more
natural
than
that
john
saltram
should
have
found
his
doom
as
he
had
found
it
unthought
of
undreamed
of
swift
and
fatal
nor
was
it
difficult
for
him
to
believe
that
marian
who
had
perhaps
never
really
loved
him
who
had
been
induced
to
accept
him
by
his
own
pertinacity
and
her
uncle
eager
desire
for
the
match
should
find
a
charm
and
a
power
in
john
saltram
that
had
been
wanting
in
himself
he
had
seen
too
many
instances
of
his
friend
influence
over
men
and
women
to
doubt
his
ability
to
win
this
innocent
inexperienced
girl
had
he
set
himself
to
win
her
he
recalled
with
a
bitter
smile
how
his
informants
had
all
described
his
rival
in
a
disparaging
tone
as
unworthy
of
so
fair
a
bride
and
he
knew
that
it
was
precisely
those
qualities
which
these
common
people
were
unable
to
appreciate
that
constituted
the
subtle
charm
by
which
john
saltram
influenced
others
the
rugged
power
and
grandeur
of
that
dark
face
which
vulgar
critics
denounced
as
plain
and
unattractive
the
rare
fascination
of
a
manner
that
varied
from
an
extreme
reserve
to
a
wild
reckless
vivacity
the
magic
of
the
deep
full
voice
with
its
capacity
for
the
expression
of
every
shade
of
emotion
these
were
attributes
to
be
passed
over
and
ignored
by
the
vulgar
yet
to
exercise
a
potent
influence
upon
sensitive
sympathetic
natures
how
that
poor
little
widow
loves
him
without
any
effort
to
win
or
hold
her
affection
on
his
side
gilbert
said
to
himself
as
he
walked
back
to
lidford
in
the
darkening
november
afternoon
brooding
always
on
the
one
subject
which
occupied
all
his
thoughts
and
can
i
doubt
his
power
to
supersede
me
if
he
cared
to
do
so
if
he
really
loved
marian
as
he
never
has
loved
branston
what
shall
i
do
go
to
him
at
once
and
tell
him
my
suspicion
tax
him
broadly
with
treachery
and
force
him
to
a
direct
confession
or
denial
shall
i
do
this
or
shall
i
bide
my
time
wait
and
watch
with
dull
dogged
patience
till
i
can
collect
some
evidence
of
his
guilt
yes
let
it
be
so
if
he
has
been
base
enough
to
do
me
this
great
wrong
mean
enough
to
steal
my
betrothed
under
a
false
name
and
to
keep
the
secret
of
his
at
any
cost
of
lies
and
deceit
let
him
go
on
to
the
end
let
him
act
out
the
play
to
the
last
and
when
i
bring
his
falsehood
home
to
him
as
i
must
surely
do
sooner
or
later
yes
if
he
is
capable
of
deceiving
me
he
shall
continue
the
lie
to
the
last
he
shall
endure
all
the
infamy
of
his
false
position
and
then
after
a
pause
he
said
to
himself
and
at
the
end
if
my
suspicions
are
confirmed
i
shall
have
lost
all
i
have
ever
valued
in
life
since
my
mother
died
my
plighted
wife
and
the
one
chosen
friend
whose
companionship
could
make
existence
pleasant
to
me
god
grant
that
this
fancy
of
mine
is
as
baseless
as
sir
david
forster
declared
it
to
be
god
grant
that
i
may
never
find
a
secret
enemy
in
john
saltram
tossed
about
thus
upon
a
sea
of
doubts
fenton
returned
to
lidford
house
where
he
was
expected
to
be
bright
and
cheerful
and
entertain
his
host
and
hostess
with
the
freshest
gossip
of
the
london
world
he
did
make
a
great
effort
to
keep
up
a
show
of
cheerfulness
at
the
but
he
felt
that
his
sister
eyes
were
watching
him
with
a
pitiless
scrutiny
and
he
knew
that
the
attempt
was
an
ignominious
failure
when
honest
martin
was
snoring
in
his
before
the
fire
with
the
red
light
shining
full
upon
his
round
healthy
countenance
lister
beckoned
her
brother
over
to
her
side
of
the
hearth
where
she
had
an
whereon
was
stretched
some
grand
design
in
berlin
to
which
she
devoted
herself
every
now
and
then
with
a
great
show
of
industry
she
had
been
absorbed
in
a
profound
calculation
of
the
stitches
upon
the
canvas
and
on
the
coloured
pattern
before
her
until
this
moment
but
she
laid
aside
her
work
with
a
solemn
air
when
gilbert
went
over
to
her
and
he
knew
at
once
what
was
coming
sit
down
gilbert
she
said
and
her
brother
dropped
into
a
chair
by
her
side
with
a
faint
sigh
of
resignation
i
want
to
talk
to
you
seriously
as
a
sister
ought
to
talk
to
a
brother
without
any
fear
of
offending
i
very
sorry
to
see
you
have
not
yet
forgotten
that
wicked
ungrateful
girl
marian
nowell
who
told
you
that
i
have
not
forgotten
her
your
own
face
gilbert
it
no
use
for
you
to
put
on
a
pretence
of
being
cheerful
and
with
me
i
know
you
too
well
to
be
deceived
by
that
kind
of
thing
i
could
see
how
you
were
all
in
spite
of
your
talk
you
ca
hoodwink
an
affectionate
sister
i
do
wish
to
hoodwink
you
my
dear
fenton
answered
quietly
or
to
affect
a
happiness
which
i
do
not
feel
any
more
than
i
wish
to
make
a
parade
of
my
grief
it
is
natural
for
an
englishman
to
be
reticent
on
such
matters
but
i
do
not
mind
owning
to
you
that
marian
nowell
is
unforgotten
by
me
and
that
the
loss
of
her
will
have
an
enduring
influence
upon
my
life
and
having
said
as
much
as
that
belle
i
must
request
that
you
will
not
expatiate
any
more
upon
this
poor
girl
breach
of
faith
i
have
forgiven
her
long
ago
and
i
shall
always
regard
her
as
the
purest
and
dearest
of
women
what
you
can
hold
her
up
as
a
paragon
of
perfection
after
she
has
thrown
you
over
in
the
most
heartless
manner
upon
my
word
gilbert
i
have
no
common
patience
with
such
folly
your
weakness
in
this
affair
from
first
to
last
has
been
positively
deplorable
i
am
sorry
you
disapprove
of
my
conduct
belle
but
as
it
is
not
a
very
pleasant
subject
do
you
think
we
may
as
well
avoid
it
now
and
henceforward
o
very
well
gilbert
the
lady
exclaimed
with
an
offended
air
of
course
if
you
choose
to
exclude
me
from
your
confidence
i
must
submit
but
i
do
think
it
rather
hard
that
your
only
sister
should
not
be
allowed
to
speak
of
a
business
that
concerns
you
so
nearly
what
good
can
arise
out
of
any
discussion
of
this
subject
belle
you
think
me
weak
and
foolish
granted
that
i
am
both
you
can
not
cure
me
of
my
weakness
or
my
folly
and
am
i
never
to
hope
that
you
will
find
some
one
else
better
worthy
of
your
regard
than
marian
nowell
i
fear
not
belle
for
me
there
is
no
one
else
lister
breathed
a
profound
sigh
and
resumed
the
counting
of
her
stitches
yet
perhaps
after
all
it
was
better
that
her
brother
should
cherish
the
memory
of
this
unlucky
attachment
it
would
preserve
him
from
the
hazard
of
any
imprudent
alliance
in
the
future
and
leave
his
fortune
free
to
descend
to
the
juvenile
listers
isabella
was
not
a
particularly
mercenary
person
but
she
was
a
woman
of
the
world
and
had
an
eye
to
the
future
aggrandisement
of
her
children
she
was
very
kind
and
considerate
to
gilbert
after
this
carefully
avoiding
any
farther
allusions
to
his
lost
love
and
taking
all
possible
pains
to
make
his
visit
pleasant
to
him
she
was
so
affectionate
and
cordial
and
seemed
so
really
anxious
for
him
to
stay
that
he
could
not
in
common
decency
hurry
back
to
town
quite
so
soon
as
he
had
intended
he
prolonged
his
visit
to
the
end
of
that
week
and
then
to
the
beginning
of
the
next
and
when
he
did
at
last
find
himself
free
to
return
to
london
the
second
week
was
nearly
ended
chapter
xxv
missing
again
gilbert
fenton
was
very
glad
to
have
made
his
escape
from
lidford
at
last
for
his
mind
was
full
of
anxiety
about
marian
again
and
again
he
had
argued
with
himself
upon
the
folly
and
uselessness
of
this
anxiety
she
for
whose
interests
he
was
so
troubled
was
safe
enough
no
doubt
protected
by
a
husband
who
was
most
likely
a
man
of
the
world
and
quite
as
able
to
protect
her
as
gilbert
himself
could
be
he
told
himself
this
but
still
the
restless
uneasy
sense
that
he
was
neglecting
his
duty
that
he
was
false
to
the
promise
made
to
old
jacob
nowell
tormented
and
perplexed
him
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
be
doing
something
that
he
had
no
right
to
remain
in
ignorance
of
the
progress
of
marian
affairs
that
he
should
be
at
hand
to
frustrate
any
attempt
at
knavery
on
the
part
of
the
lawyer
to
be
sure
that
the
old
man
wealth
suffered
no
diminution
before
it
reached
the
hands
of
his
heiress
gilbert
fenton
felt
that
his
promise
to
the
dead
bound
him
to
do
these
things
and
felt
at
the
same
time
the
weakness
of
his
own
position
with
relation
to
marian
by
what
right
could
he
interfere
in
the
conduct
of
her
affairs
what
claim
could
he
assert
to
defend
her
interests
who
would
listen
to
any
romantic
notion
about
a
promise
made
to
the
dead
he
went
to
queen
anne
court
upon
the
night
of
his
return
to
london
the
silversmith
shop
looked
exactly
the
same
as
when
he
had
first
seen
it
the
gas
burning
dimly
the
tarnished
old
salvers
and
tankards
gleaming
duskily
in
the
faint
light
with
all
manner
of
purple
and
greenish
hues
tulliver
was
in
his
little
den
at
the
back
of
the
shop
and
emerged
with
his
usual
rapidity
at
the
ringing
of
the
o
it
you
is
it
sir
he
asked
in
an
indifferent
tone
what
can
i
do
for
you
this
evening
is
your
late
master
granddaughter
holbrook
here
gilbert
asked
no
holbrook
went
away
on
the
morning
after
my
master
death
i
told
you
that
when
you
called
here
last
i
am
quite
aware
of
that
but
i
thought
it
likely
holbrook
might
return
here
with
her
husband
to
take
possession
of
the
property
which
i
suppose
you
know
now
belongs
to
her
yes
i
know
all
about
that
but
she
has
come
yet
to
take
possession
she
does
seem
in
such
a
desperate
hurry
about
it
i
daresay
she
knows
that
things
are
safe
enough
medler
the
lawyer
is
not
the
kind
of
party
to
be
cheated
out
of
sixpence
he
has
taken
an
inventory
of
every
article
in
the
place
and
the
weight
and
value
of
every
article
your
friend
holbrook
need
be
afraid
i
suppose
she
some
relation
of
yours
sir
judging
by
the
interest
you
seem
to
take
in
her
affairs
yes
gilbert
said
not
caring
to
answer
this
question
directly
i
do
take
a
warm
interest
in
holbrook
affairs
and
i
am
very
anxious
to
see
her
placed
in
undisputed
possession
of
her
late
property
i
should
think
her
husband
would
see
after
that
tulliver
remarked
with
a
sneer
gilbert
left
the
court
after
having
asked
a
few
questions
about
jacob
nowell
funeral
the
old
man
had
been
buried
at
kensalgreen
followed
to
the
grave
only
by
the
devoted
tulliver
medler
and
the
local
surgeon
who
had
attended
him
in
his
last
illness
he
had
lived
a
lonely
friendless
life
holding
himself
aloof
from
his
and
there
were
neither
neighbours
nor
friends
to
lament
his
ending
the
vagabond
boys
of
the
neighbourhood
had
clustered
round
the
door
to
witness
the
last
dismal
ceremony
of
nowell
existence
and
had
hung
about
the
for
some
time
after
the
funeral
had
departed
peering
curiously
down
into
the
darksome
area
and
speculating
upon
the
hoards
of
wealth
which
the
old
miser
had
hidden
away
in
and
under
the
stone
flags
of
the
scullery
or
in
the
crannies
of
the
dilapidated
walls
there
were
no
bounds
to
the
imagination
of
these
street
arabs
who
had
been
in
the
habit
of
yelping
and
whooping
at
the
old
man
heels
when
he
took
his
infrequent
walks
abroad
assailing
him
with
derisive
epithets
alluding
to
his
miserly
propensities
amongst
the
elders
of
the
court
there
was
some
little
talk
about
the
dead
man
and
the
probable
disposal
of
his
property
with
a
good
deal
of
argument
and
laying
down
of
the
law
on
the
part
of
the
graver
and
wiser
members
of
that
community
some
people
affecting
to
know
to
a
sixpence
the
amount
of
jacob
nowell
savings
others
accrediting
him
with
the
possession
of
fabulous
riches
and
all
being
unanimous
in
the
idea
that
the
old
man
heir
or
heirs
as
the
case
might
be
would
speedily
scatter
his
treasures
many
of
these
people
could
remember
the
silversmith
prodigal
son
but
none
among
them
were
aware
of
that
gentleman
return
they
wondered
a
good
deal
as
to
whether
he
was
still
living
and
whether
the
money
had
been
left
to
him
or
to
that
pretty
young
woman
who
had
appeared
in
the
last
days
of
the
old
life
no
one
knowing
whence
she
had
come
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
from
questioning
luke
tulliver
the
court
knew
of
old
experience
the
most
mysterious
dungeons
of
the
spanish
inquisition
the
secret
chambers
under
the
leads
in
venice
were
not
closer
or
deeper
than
the
mind
of
that
young
man
the
court
had
been
inclined
to
think
that
luke
tulliver
would
come
into
all
his
master
money
and
opinion
inclined
that
way
even
yet
seeing
that
tulliver
still
held
his
ground
in
the
shop
and
that
no
strangers
had
been
seen
to
enter
the
place
since
the
funeral
from
queen
anne
court
gilbert
fenton
went
on
to
the
gloomy
street
where
medler
had
his
office
and
abode
it
was
not
an
hour
for
a
professional
visit
but
gilbert
found
the
lawyer
still
hard
at
work
at
his
desk
under
the
lurid
light
of
a
battered
old
which
left
the
corners
of
the
dingy
wainscoted
room
in
profound
obscurity
he
looked
up
from
his
papers
with
some
show
of
surprise
on
hearing
fenton
name
announced
by
the
slipshod
who
had
admitted
the
late
visitor
medler
solitary
clerk
having
departed
to
his
own
dwelling
some
hours
before
i
must
ask
you
to
excuse
this
untimely
call
medler
gilbert
said
politely
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
i
am
a
little
anxious
about
my
friend
holbrook
and
her
affairs
and
i
thought
you
the
most
likely
person
to
give
me
some
information
about
them
i
should
have
called
in
business
hours
but
i
have
only
just
returned
from
the
country
and
did
not
care
to
delay
my
inquiries
until
i
have
just
come
from
queen
anne
court
and
am
rather
surprised
to
find
that
neither
holbrook
nor
her
husband
has
been
there
you
have
seen
or
heard
from
them
since
the
funeral
i
suppose
no
fenton
i
have
neither
seen
nor
heard
of
them
i
wrote
a
formal
letter
to
holbrook
setting
out
the
contents
of
the
will
but
there
has
been
no
answer
as
yet
strange
is
it
not
gilbert
exclaimed
with
an
anxious
look
well
yes
it
is
certainly
not
the
usual
course
of
proceeding
however
there
is
time
enough
yet
the
funeral
has
not
been
over
much
more
than
a
week
the
property
is
perfectly
safe
you
know
of
course
but
it
is
not
the
less
extraordinary
that
holbrook
should
hang
back
in
this
manner
i
will
go
down
to
hampshire
the
first
thing
and
see
mrs
holbrook
humph
muttered
the
lawyer
i
ca
say
that
i
see
any
necessity
for
that
but
of
course
you
know
best
gilbert
fenton
did
start
for
hampshire
early
the
next
morning
by
the
same
train
in
which
marian
had
travelled
after
her
grandfather
death
it
was
still
quite
early
in
the
day
when
he
found
himself
at
malsham
that
quiet
comfortable
little
where
he
had
first
discovered
a
clue
to
the
abode
of
his
lost
love
he
went
to
the
hotel
and
hired
a
fly
to
take
him
to
crosber
where
he
left
the
vehicle
at
the
old
inn
preferring
to
walk
on
to
the
grange
it
was
a
bright
november
day
with
a
pale
yellow
sunlight
shining
on
the
level
fields
and
distant
hills
that
rose
beyond
them
crowned
with
a
scanty
fringe
of
firs
that
stood
out
black
and
sharp
against
the
clear
autumn
sky
it
was
a
cheerful
day
and
a
solitary
bird
was
singing
here
and
there
as
if
beguiled
by
that
pleasant
warmth
and
sunshine
into
the
fond
belief
that
winter
was
still
far
off
and
the
glory
of
fields
and
woods
not
yet
departed
gilbert
spirits
rose
in
some
degree
under
the
influence
of
that
late
brightness
and
sweet
rustic
calm
he
fancied
that
there
might
be
still
some
kind
of
happiness
for
him
in
the
long
years
to
come
pale
and
faint
like
the
sunlight
of
an
autumnal
calm
if
he
might
be
marian
friend
and
brother
her
devoted
counsellor
her
untiring
servant
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
be
content
that
he
could
live
on
from
year
to
year
moderately
happy
in
the
occasional
delight
of
her
society
rewarded
for
his
devotion
by
a
few
kind
words
now
and
then
a
letter
a
friendly
smile
rewarded
still
more
richly
by
her
perfect
trust
in
him
these
thoughts
were
in
his
mind
as
he
went
along
the
lonely
country
lane
leading
to
the
grange
thoughts
which
seemed
inspired
by
the
tranquil
landscape
and
peaceful
autumn
day
thoughts
which
were
full
of
the
purest
love
and
charity
yes
even
for
his
unknown
rival
even
if
that
rival
should
prove
to
be
the
one
man
in
all
this
world
from
whom
a
deep
wrong
would
seem
most
bitter
what
am
i
that
i
should
measure
the
force
of
his
temptation
he
said
to
himself
or
the
strength
of
his
resistance
let
me
be
sure
that
he
loves
my
darling
as
truly
as
i
love
her
that
the
chief
object
of
his
life
has
been
and
will
be
her
happiness
and
then
let
me
put
away
all
selfish
vindictive
thoughts
and
fall
quietly
into
the
background
of
my
dear
one
life
content
to
be
her
brother
and
her
friend
the
grange
looked
unchanged
in
its
sombre
lonely
aspect
the
chrysanthemums
were
all
withered
by
this
time
and
there
were
now
no
flowers
in
the
garden
the
bell
was
answered
by
the
same
woman
who
had
admitted
him
before
and
who
made
no
parley
about
letting
him
in
this
time
my
young
missus
said
i
was
to
be
sure
and
let
her
know
if
you
came
sir
she
said
she
very
anxious
to
see
you
your
young
mistress
do
you
mean
mrs
holbrook
no
sir
miss
carley
master
daughter
indeed
i
remember
the
young
lady
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
see
her
if
she
has
anything
to
say
to
me
but
it
is
holbrook
i
have
come
to
see
she
is
at
home
i
suppose
o
dear
no
sir
holbrook
has
left
without
a
word
of
notice
gone
nobody
knows
where
that
is
what
has
made
our
young
missus
fret
about
it
so
holbrook
has
left
gilbert
exclaimed
in
blank
amazement
when
it
more
than
a
week
ago
now
sir
and
do
none
of
you
know
why
she
went
away
or
where
she
has
gone
no
more
than
the
dead
sir
but
you
better
see
miss
carley
she
be
able
to
tell
you
all
about
it
the
woman
led
him
into
the
house
and
to
the
room
in
which
he
had
seen
marian
there
was
no
fire
here
and
the
room
had
a
desolate
unoccupied
look
though
the
sun
was
shining
cheerfully
on
the
windows
there
were
a
few
books
which
gilbert
remembered
as
marian
literary
treasures
neatly
arranged
on
a
rickety
old
chiffonier
by
the
and
the
desk
and
which
he
had
seen
on
his
previous
visit
he
was
half
bewildered
by
what
the
woman
had
told
him
and
his
heart
beat
tumultuously
as
he
stood
by
the
empty
hearth
waiting
for
ellen
carley
coming
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
girl
never
would
come
the
ticking
of
an
old
clock
in
the
hall
had
a
ghastly
sound
in
the
dead
silence
of
the
house
and
an
industrious
mouse
made
itself
distinctly
heard
behind
the
wainscot
at
last
a
light
rapid
footstep
came
tripping
across
the
hall
and
ellen
carley
entered
the
room
she
was
looking
paler
than
when
gilbert
had
seen
her
last
and
the
bright
face
was
very
grave
for
heaven
sake
tell
me
what
this
means
miss
carley
gilbert
began
eagerly
your
servant
tells
me
that
holbrook
has
left
you
in
some
mysterious
way
i
imagine
from
what
the
woman
said
o
sir
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
here
i
should
have
written
to
you
if
i
had
known
where
to
address
a
letter
yes
sir
she
has
gone
that
dear
sweet
young
creature
and
i
fear
some
harm
has
come
to
her
the
girl
burst
into
tears
and
for
some
minutes
could
say
no
more
pray
pray
be
calm
gilbert
said
gently
and
tell
me
all
you
can
about
this
business
how
did
holbrook
leave
this
place
and
why
do
you
suspect
that
any
harm
has
befallen
her
there
is
every
reason
to
think
so
sir
is
it
like
her
to
leave
us
without
a
word
of
notice
knowing
as
she
must
have
known
the
unhappiness
she
would
cause
to
me
who
love
her
so
well
by
such
a
step
she
knew
how
i
loved
her
i
think
she
had
scarcely
a
secret
from
me
if
you
will
only
tell
me
the
manner
of
her
departure
gilbert
said
rather
impatiently
yes
yes
sir
i
am
coming
to
that
directly
she
seemed
happier
after
she
came
back
from
london
poor
dear
and
she
told
me
that
her
grandfather
had
left
her
money
and
that
she
was
likely
to
become
quite
a
rich
woman
the
thought
of
this
gave
her
so
much
pleasure
not
for
her
own
sake
but
for
her
husband
whose
cares
and
difficulties
would
all
come
to
an
end
now
she
told
me
she
had
been
back
only
a
few
days
when
i
left
home
for
a
day
and
a
night
to
see
my
aunt
an
old
woman
and
a
constant
invalid
who
lives
at
malsham
i
had
put
off
going
to
her
for
a
long
time
for
i
did
care
about
leaving
holbrook
but
i
had
to
go
at
last
my
aunt
thinking
it
hard
that
i
could
spare
time
to
spend
a
day
with
her
and
tidy
up
her
house
a
bit
and
see
to
the
girl
that
waits
upon
her
poor
helpless
thing
so
i
started
off
before
noon
one
day
after
telling
holbrook
where
i
was
going
and
when
i
hoped
to
be
back
she
was
in
very
good
spirits
that
morning
for
she
expected
her
husband
next
day
have
told
him
nothing
about
the
good
fortune
that
has
come
to
me
nelly
she
said
have
only
written
to
him
begging
him
to
return
as
quickly
as
possible
and
he
will
be
here
by
the
afternoon
express
holbrook
is
a
great
walker
and
generally
walks
from
malsham
here
by
a
shorter
way
than
the
across
some
fields
and
by
the
his
wife
used
always
to
go
part
of
the
way
to
meet
him
when
she
knew
he
was
coming
i
know
she
meant
to
go
and
meet
him
this
time
the
way
is
very
lonely
and
i
have
often
felt
fidgety
about
her
going
alone
but
she
had
a
bit
of
fear
and
i
did
like
to
offer
to
go
with
her
feeling
sure
that
holbrook
would
be
vexed
by
seeing
me
at
such
a
time
well
sir
i
had
arranged
everything
comfortably
so
that
she
should
miss
nothing
by
my
being
away
and
i
bade
her
and
started
off
to
walk
to
malsham
i
ca
tell
you
how
hard
it
seemed
to
me
to
leave
her
for
it
was
the
first
time
we
had
been
parted
for
so
much
as
a
day
since
she
came
to
the
grange
i
thought
of
her
all
the
while
i
was
at
my
aunt
who
has
very
fidgety
ways
poor
old
lady
and
is
a
pleasant
person
to
be
with
i
felt
quite
in
a
fever
of
impatience
to
get
home
again
and
was
very
glad
when
a
dropped
me
at
the
end
of
the
lane
and
i
saw
the
gray
old
chimneys
above
the
tops
of
the
trees
it
was
four
in
the
afternoon
when
i
got
home
father
was
at
tea
in
the
where
we
take
our
meals
and
the
house
was
as
quiet
as
a
grave
i
came
straight
to
this
room
but
it
was
empty
and
when
i
called
martha
she
told
me
holbrook
had
gone
out
at
one
in
the
day
and
had
not
been
home
since
though
she
was
expected
back
to
dinner
at
three
she
had
been
away
three
hours
then
and
at
a
time
when
i
knew
she
could
not
expect
holbrook
unless
she
had
received
a
fresh
letter
from
him
to
say
that
he
was
coming
by
an
earlier
train
than
usual
i
asked
martha
if
there
had
been
any
letters
for
holbrook
that
day
and
she
told
me
yes
there
had
been
one
by
the
morning
post
it
was
no
use
asking
martha
what
kind
of
letter
it
looked
and
whether
it
was
from
holbrook
for
the
poor
ignorant
creature
can
neither
read
nor
write
and
one
handwriting
is
the
same
as
another
to
her
holbrook
had
told
her
nothing
as
to
where
she
was
going
only
saying
that
she
would
be
back
in
an
hour
or
two
martha
let
her
out
at
the
gate
and
watched
her
take
the
way
towards
the
and
seeing
this
made
sure
she
was
going
to
meet
her
husband
well
sir
five
struck
and
holbrook
had
not
come
home
i
began
to
feel
seriously
uneasy
about
her
i
told
my
father
so
but
he
took
the
matter
lightly
enough
at
first
saying
it
was
no
business
of
ours
and
that
holbrook
was
just
as
well
able
to
take
care
of
herself
as
any
one
else
but
after
five
i
could
rest
a
minute
longer
so
i
put
on
my
bonnet
and
shawl
and
went
down
by
the
after
sending
one
of
the
to
look
for
my
poor
dear
in
the
opposite
direction
it
a
very
lonely
walk
at
the
best
of
times
though
a
few
of
the
country
folks
do
go
that
way
between
malsham
and
crosber
on
there
scarcely
a
house
to
be
seen
for
miles
except
wyncomb
farmhouse
stephen
whitelaw
place
which
lies
a
little
way
back
from
the
about
a
mile
from
here
besides
that
and
a
solitary
cottage
here
and
there
you
wo
see
a
sign
of
human
life
for
four
or
five
miles
anybody
might
be
pushed
into
the
river
and
made
away
with
in
broad
daylight
and
no
one
need
be
the
wiser
the
loneliness
of
the
place
struck
me
with
an
awful
fear
that
afternoon
and
from
that
moment
i
began
to
think
that
i
should
never
see
holbrook
again
what
of
her
husband
he
was
expected
on
this
particular
afternoon
you
say
he
was
sir
but
he
did
not
come
till
the
next
day
it
was
almost
dark
when
i
went
to
the
i
walked
for
about
three
miles
and
a
half
to
a
gate
that
opened
into
the
fields
by
which
holbrook
came
across
from
malsham
i
knew
his
wife
never
went
farther
than
this
gate
but
used
to
wait
for
him
here
if
she
happened
to
be
the
first
to
reach
it
i
hurried
along
half
running
all
the
way
and
calling
aloud
to
holbrook
every
now
and
then
with
all
my
might
but
there
was
no
answer
some
men
in
a
boat
loaded
with
hay
stopped
to
ask
me
what
was
the
matter
but
they
could
tell
me
nothing
they
were
coming
from
malsham
and
had
seen
no
one
along
the
bank
i
called
at
whitelaw
as
i
came
back
not
with
much
hope
that
i
should
hear
anything
but
what
could
i
do
but
make
inquiries
anywhere
and
everywhere
i
was
almost
wild
with
fright
by
this
time
they
could
tell
me
nothing
at
wyncomb
farm
stephen
whitelaw
was
alone
in
the
kitchen
smoking
his
pipe
by
a
great
fire
he
had
been
out
all
day
he
told
me
and
none
of
his
people
had
seen
or
heard
anything
out
of
the
common
as
to
any
harm
having
come
to
holbrook
by
the
he
said
he
did
think
that
was
possible
for
his
men
had
been
at
work
in
the
fields
near
the
river
all
the
afternoon
and
must
have
seen
or
heard
if
there
had
been
anything
wrong
there
was
some
kind
of
comfort
in
this
and
i
left
the
farm
with
my
mind
a
little
lighter
than
it
had
been
when
i
went
in
there
i
knew
that
stephen
whitelaw
was
no
friend
to
holbrook
that
he
had
a
kind
of
grudge
against
her
because
she
had
been
on
some
one
else
side
in
in
something
ellen
carley
blushed
as
she
came
to
this
part
of
her
story
and
then
went
on
rather
hurriedly
to
hide
her
confusion
he
did
like
her
sir
you
see
i
knew
this
but
i
did
think
it
possible
he
could
deceive
me
in
a
matter
of
life
and
death
so
i
came
home
hoping
to
find
holbrook
there
before
me
but
there
were
no
signs
of
her
nor
of
her
husband
either
though
i
had
fully
expected
to
see
him
even
father
owned
that
things
looked
bad
now
and
he
let
me
send
every
man
about
the
place
some
one
way
and
some
another
to
hunt
for
my
poor
darling
i
went
into
crosber
myself
though
it
was
getting
late
by
this
time
and
made
inquiries
of
every
creature
i
knew
in
the
village
but
it
was
all
no
good
no
one
had
seen
anything
of
the
lady
i
was
looking
for
and
the
husband
gilbert
asked
again
what
of
him
he
came
next
day
at
the
usual
hour
after
we
had
been
astir
all
night
and
the
had
been
far
and
wide
looking
for
holbrook
i
never
saw
any
one
seem
so
shocked
and
horrified
as
he
did
when
we
told
him
how
his
wife
had
been
missing
for
more
than
hours
he
is
not
a
gentleman
to
show
his
feelings
much
at
ordinary
times
and
he
was
quiet
enough
in
the
midst
of
his
alarm
but
he
turned
as
white
as
death
and
i
never
saw
the
natural
colour
come
back
to
his
face
all
the
time
he
was
down
here
how
long
did
he
stay
he
only
left
yesterday
he
was
travelling
about
the
country
all
the
time
coming
back
here
of
a
night
to
sleep
and
with
the
hope
that
we
might
have
heard
something
in
his
absence
the
river
was
dragged
for
three
days
but
thank
god
nothing
came
of
that
holbrook
set
the
malsham
police
to
work
not
that
they
much
good
i
think
but
he
would
leave
a
stone
unturned
and
now
i
believe
he
has
gone
to
london
to
get
help
from
the
police
there
but
o
sir
i
ca
make
it
out
and
i
have
lain
awake
night
after
night
thinking
of
it
and
puzzling
myself
about
it
until
all
sorts
of
dreadful
fancies
come
into
my
mind
what
fancies
o
sir
i
scarcely
dare
tell
you
but
i
loved
that
sweet
young
lady
so
well
that
i
have
been
as
watchful
and
jealous
in
all
things
that
concerned
her
as
if
she
had
been
my
own
sister
i
have
thought
sometimes
that
her
husband
had
grown
tired
of
her
that
however
dearly
he
might
have
loved
her
at
first
as
i
suppose
he
did
his
love
had
worn
out
little
by
little
and
he
felt
her
a
burden
to
him
what
other
reason
could
there
be
for
him
to
keep
her
hidden
away
in
this
dull
place
month
after
month
when
he
must
have
seen
that
her
youth
and
beauty
and
gaiety
of
heart
were
slowly
vanishing
away
if
he
had
eyes
to
see
anything
but
good
heavens
gilbert
exclaimed
startled
by
the
sudden
horror
of
the
idea
which
ellen
carley
words
suggested
you
surely
do
not
imagine
that
marian
husband
had
any
part
in
her
disappearance
that
he
could
be
capable
of
i
do
know
what
to
think
sir
the
girl
answered
interrupting
him
i
know
that
i
have
never
liked
holbrook
never
liked
or
trusted
him
from
the
first
though
he
has
been
civil
enough
and
kind
enough
in
his
own
distant
way
to
me
that
dear
young
lady
could
not
disappear
off
the
face
of
the
earth
as
it
seems
she
has
done
without
the
evil
work
of
some
one
as
to
her
leaving
this
place
of
her
own
free
will
without
a
word
of
warning
to
her
husband
or
to
me
that
i
am
sure
she
would
never
dream
of
doing
no
sir
there
has
been
foul
play
of
some
kind
and
afraid
i
shall
never
see
that
dear
face
again
the
girl
said
this
with
an
air
of
conviction
that
sent
a
deadly
chill
to
gilbert
fenton
heart
it
seemed
to
him
in
this
moment
of
supreme
anguish
as
if
all
his
trouble
of
the
past
all
his
vague
fears
and
anxieties
about
the
woman
he
loved
had
been
the
foreshadowing
of
this
evil
to
come
he
had
a
blank
helpless
feeling
a
dismal
sense
of
his
own
weakness
which
for
the
moment
mastered
him
against
any
ordinary
calamity
he
would
have
held
himself
bravely
enough
with
the
natural
strength
of
an
ardent
hopeful
character
but
against
this
mysterious
catastrophe
courage
and
manhood
could
avail
nothing
she
was
gone
the
fragile
helpless
creature
he
had
pledged
himself
to
protect
gone
from
all
who
knew
her
leaving
not
the
faintest
clue
to
her
fate
could
he
doubt
that
this
energetic
girl
was
right
and
that
some
foul
deed
had
been
done
of
which
marian
holbrook
was
the
victim
if
she
lives
i
will
find
her
he
said
at
last
after
a
long
pause
in
which
he
had
sat
in
gloomy
silence
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
meditating
the
circumstances
of
marian
disappearance
living
or
dead
i
will
find
her
it
shall
be
the
business
of
my
life
from
this
hour
all
my
serious
thoughts
have
been
of
her
from
the
moment
in
which
i
first
knew
her
they
will
be
doubly
hers
henceforward
how
good
and
true
you
are
ellen
carley
exclaimed
admiringly
and
how
you
must
have
loved
her
i
guessed
when
you
were
here
last
that
it
was
you
to
whom
she
was
engaged
before
her
marriage
and
told
her
as
much
but
she
would
not
acknowledge
that
i
was
right
o
how
i
wish
she
had
kept
faith
with
you
how
much
happier
she
might
have
been
as
your
wife
people
have
different
notions
of
happiness
you
see
miss
carley
gilbert
answered
with
a
bitter
smile
yes
you
were
right
it
was
i
who
was
to
have
been
marian
nowell
husband
whose
every
hope
of
the
future
was
bound
up
in
her
but
all
that
is
past
whatever
bitterness
i
felt
against
her
at
first
and
i
do
not
think
i
was
ever
very
bitter
has
passed
away
i
am
nothing
now
but
her
friend
her
steadfast
and
constant
friend
thank
heaven
that
she
has
such
a
friend
ellen
said
earnestly
and
you
will
make
it
your
business
to
look
for
her
sir
the
chief
object
of
my
life
from
this
hour
and
you
will
try
to
discover
whether
her
husband
is
really
true
or
whether
the
search
that
he
has
made
for
her
has
been
a
blind
to
hide
his
own
guilt
what
grounds
have
you
for
supposing
his
guilt
possible
asked
gilbert
there
are
crimes
too
detestable
for
credibility
and
this
would
be
such
a
one
you
may
imagine
that
i
have
no
friendly
feeling
towards
this
man
yet
i
can
not
for
an
instant
conceive
him
capable
of
harming
a
hair
of
his
wife
head
because
you
have
not
brooded
upon
this
business
as
i
have
sir
for
hours
and
hours
together
until
the
smallest
things
seem
to
have
an
awful
meaning
i
have
thought
of
every
word
and
every
look
of
holbrook
in
the
past
and
all
my
thoughts
have
pointed
one
way
i
believe
that
he
was
tired
of
his
sweet
young
wife
that
his
marriage
was
a
burden
and
a
trouble
to
him
somehow
that
it
had
arisen
out
of
an
impulse
that
had
passed
away
all
this
might
be
and
yet
the
man
be
innocent
he
might
be
yes
sir
it
is
a
hard
thing
perhaps
even
to
think
him
guilty
for
a
moment
but
it
is
so
difficult
to
account
in
any
common
way
for
holbrook
disappearance
if
there
had
been
murder
done
the
girl
shuddered
as
she
said
the
words
a
common
murder
such
as
one
hears
of
in
lonely
country
places
surely
it
must
have
come
to
light
before
this
after
the
search
that
has
been
made
all
round
about
but
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
for
holbrook
to
decoy
his
wife
away
to
london
or
anywhere
else
she
would
have
gone
anywhere
with
him
at
a
moment
notice
she
obeyed
him
implicitly
in
everything
but
why
should
he
have
taken
her
away
from
this
place
in
a
secret
manner
asked
gilbert
he
was
free
to
remove
her
openly
and
then
you
describe
him
as
taking
an
amount
of
trouble
in
his
search
for
her
which
might
have
been
so
easily
avoided
had
he
acted
with
ordinary
prudence
and
caution
say
that
he
wanted
to
keep
the
secret
of
his
marriage
from
the
world
in
which
he
lives
and
to
place
his
wife
in
even
a
more
secluded
spot
than
this
which
scarcely
seems
possible
what
could
have
been
easier
for
him
than
to
take
her
away
when
and
where
he
pleased
no
one
here
would
have
had
any
right
to
question
his
actions
ellen
carley
shook
her
head
doubtfully
i
do
know
sir
she
answered
slowly
i
daresay
my
fancies
are
very
foolish
they
may
have
come
perhaps
out
of
thinking
about
this
so
much
till
my
brain
has
got
addled
as
one
may
say
but
it
flashed
upon
me
all
of
a
sudden
one
night
as
holbrook
was
standing
in
our
parlour
talking
about
his
wife
it
flashed
upon
me
that
he
was
in
the
secret
of
her
disappearance
and
that
he
was
only
acting
with
us
in
his
pretence
of
anxiety
and
all
that
i
fancied
there
was
a
guilty
look
in
his
face
somehow
did
you
tell
him
about
his
wife
good
fortune
the
money
left
her
by
her
grandfather
i
did
sir
i
thought
it
right
to
tell
him
everything
i
could
about
my
poor
dear
young
lady
journey
to
london
she
had
told
him
of
that
in
her
letters
it
seemed
but
not
about
the
money
she
had
been
keeping
that
back
for
the
pleasure
of
telling
him
with
her
own
lips
and
seeing
his
face
light
up
she
said
to
me
when
he
heard
the
good
news
i
asked
him
about
the
letter
which
had
come
in
the
morning
of
the
day
she
disappeared
and
whether
it
was
from
him
but
he
said
no
he
had
not
written
counting
upon
being
with
his
wife
that
evening
it
was
only
at
the
last
moment
he
was
prevented
coming
you
have
looked
for
that
letter
i
suppose
o
yes
sir
i
searched
and
holbrook
too
in
every
direction
but
the
letter
was
to
be
found
he
seemed
very
vexed
about
it
very
anxious
to
find
it
we
could
not
but
think
that
holbrook
had
gone
to
meet
some
one
that
day
and
that
the
letter
had
something
to
do
with
her
going
out
i
am
sure
she
would
not
have
gone
beyond
the
garden
and
the
meadow
for
pleasure
alone
she
never
had
been
outside
the
gate
without
me
except
when
she
went
to
meet
her
husband
strange
muttered
gilbert
he
was
wondering
about
that
letter
what
could
have
been
the
lure
which
had
beguiled
marian
away
from
the
house
that
day
what
except
a
letter
from
her
husband
it
seemed
hardly
probable
that
she
would
have
gone
to
meet
any
one
but
him
or
that
any
one
else
would
have
appointed
a
meeting
on
the
the
fact
that
she
had
gone
out
at
an
earlier
hour
than
the
time
at
which
she
had
been
in
the
habit
of
meeting
her
husband
when
he
came
from
the
malsham
station
went
some
way
to
prove
that
the
letter
had
influenced
her
movements
gilbert
thought
of
the
fortune
which
had
been
left
to
marian
and
which
gave
her
existence
a
new
value
perhaps
exposed
her
to
new
dangers
her
husband
interests
were
involved
in
her
life
her
death
should
she
die
childless
must
needs
deprive
him
of
all
advantage
from
jacob
nowell
wealth
the
only
person
to
profit
from
such
an
event
would
be
percival
nowell
but
he
was
far
away
gilbert
believed
and
completely
ignorant
of
his
reversionary
interest
in
his
property
there
was
medler
the
attorney
a
man
whom
gilbert
had
distrusted
from
the
first
it
was
just
possible
that
the
letter
had
been
from
him
yet
most
improbable
that
he
should
have
asked
holbrook
to
meet
him
out
of
doors
instead
of
coming
to
her
at
the
grange
or
that
she
should
have
acceded
to
such
a
request
had
he
made
it
the
whole
affair
was
encompassed
with
mystery
and
gilbert
fenton
heart
sank
as
he
contemplated
the
task
that
lay
before
him
i
shall
spend
a
day
or
two
in
this
neighbourhood
before
i
return
to
town
he
said
to
ellen
carley
presently
there
are
inquiries
that
i
should
like
to
make
with
my
own
lips
i
shall
be
only
going
over
old
ground
i
daresay
but
it
will
be
some
satisfaction
to
me
to
do
it
for
myself
can
you
give
me
here
for
a
night
or
two
or
shall
i
put
up
at
crosber
i
sure
father
would
be
very
happy
to
accommodate
you
here
sir
plenty
of
room
now
too
much
for
my
taste
the
house
seems
like
a
wilderness
now
holbrook
is
gone
thanks
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
sleep
here
there
is
just
the
chance
that
you
may
have
some
news
for
me
or
i
for
you
ah
sir
it
only
a
very
poor
chance
i
afraid
the
girl
answered
hopelessly
she
went
with
gilbert
to
the
gate
and
watched
him
as
he
walked
away
towards
the
river
his
first
impulse
was
to
follow
the
path
which
marian
had
taken
that
day
and
to
see
for
himself
what
manner
of
place
it
was
from
which
she
had
so
mysteriously
vanished
chapter
xxvi
in
bondage
adela
branston
found
life
very
dreary
in
the
splendid
gloom
of
her
town
house
she
would
have
infinitely
preferred
the
villa
near
maidenhead
for
the
place
of
her
occupation
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
in
london
she
was
nearer
john
saltram
and
that
any
moment
of
any
day
might
bring
him
to
her
side
the
days
passed
however
empty
useless
days
frittered
away
in
frivolous
occupations
or
wasted
in
melancholy
idleness
and
john
saltram
did
not
come
or
came
so
rarely
that
the
only
effect
of
his
visits
was
to
keep
up
the
fever
and
restlessness
of
the
widow
mind
she
had
fancied
that
life
would
be
so
bright
for
her
when
the
day
of
her
freedom
came
that
she
would
reap
so
rich
a
harvest
of
happiness
as
a
reward
for
the
sacrifice
which
she
had
made
in
marrying
old
michael
branston
and
enduring
his
peevishness
and
with
tolerable
during
the
years
of
their
wedded
life
she
had
fancied
this
and
now
her
release
had
come
to
her
and
was
worthless
in
her
sight
because
the
one
man
she
cared
for
had
proved
himself
cold
and
indifferent
in
spite
of
his
coldness
however
she
told
herself
that
he
loved
her
that
he
had
loved
her
from
the
earliest
period
of
their
acquaintance
she
was
a
poor
weak
little
woman
the
veriest
spoilt
child
of
fortune
and
she
clung
to
this
belief
with
a
fond
foolish
persistence
a
blind
devoted
obstinacy
against
which
the
arguments
of
pallinson
were
utterly
vain
although
that
lady
devoted
a
great
deal
of
time
and
energy
to
the
agreeable
duty
which
she
called
opening
dear
adela
eyes
about
that
dissipated
mr
saltram
to
a
correct
view
of
this
subject
adela
branston
eyes
were
not
to
be
opened
in
any
wise
she
was
wilfully
resolutely
blind
clinging
to
the
hope
that
this
cruel
neglect
on
john
saltram
part
arose
only
from
his
delicacy
of
feeling
and
tender
care
for
her
reputation
but
o
how
i
wish
that
he
would
come
to
me
she
said
to
herself
again
and
again
as
those
slow
dreary
days
went
by
burdened
and
weighed
down
by
the
oppressive
society
of
pallinson
as
well
as
by
her
own
sad
thoughts
my
husband
has
been
dead
ever
so
long
now
and
what
need
have
we
to
study
the
opinion
of
the
world
so
much
of
course
i
would
marry
him
till
a
year
or
more
after
poor
michael
death
but
i
should
like
to
see
him
often
to
be
sure
that
he
still
cares
for
me
as
he
used
to
care
yes
i
am
sure
he
used
in
the
dear
old
days
at
maidenhead
why
does
he
come
to
me
he
knows
that
i
love
him
he
must
know
that
i
have
no
brighter
hope
than
to
make
him
the
master
of
my
fortune
and
yet
he
goes
on
in
those
dismal
temple
chambers
toiling
at
his
literary
work
as
if
he
had
not
a
thought
in
the
world
beyond
earning
so
many
pounds
a
week
this
was
the
perpetual
drift
of
branston
meditations
and
in
the
absence
of
any
sign
or
token
of
regard
from
john
saltram
all
pallinson
attempts
to
amuse
her
all
the
fascinations
and
accomplishments
of
the
elegant
theobald
were
thrown
away
upon
an
unreceptive
soil
there
were
not
many
amusements
open
to
a
london
public
at
that
dull
season
of
the
year
except
the
theatres
and
for
those
places
of
entertainment
pallinson
cherished
a
shuddering
aversion
but
there
were
occasional
morning
and
evening
recitals
or
concerts
where
the
music
for
the
most
part
was
of
a
classical
and
recondite
character
feasts
of
melody
at
which
and
forgotten
sonatas
of
gluck
or
bach
or
chembini
were
introduced
to
a
discriminating
public
for
the
first
time
and
to
these
pallinson
and
theobald
conducted
poor
adela
branston
whose
musical
proclivities
had
never
yet
soared
into
higher
regions
than
those
occupied
by
the
sparkling
joyous
genius
of
rossini
and
to
whom
the
revived
sonatas
or
the
familiar
gems
of
classical
art
were
as
unintelligible
as
so
much
hebrew
or
syriac
perhaps
they
were
not
much
more
delightful
to
pallinson
but
that
worthy
matron
had
a
profound
veneration
for
the
conventionalities
of
life
and
these
classical
matinées
and
recitals
seemed
to
her
exactly
the
correct
sort
of
thing
for
the
amusement
of
a
young
widow
whose
husband
had
not
very
long
ago
been
consigned
to
the
tomb
so
poor
adela
was
dragged
hither
and
thither
to
gloomy
where
the
cold
winter
light
made
the
performers
look
pale
and
wan
or
to
aristocratic
graciously
lent
to
some
favoured
pianiste
by
their
distinguished
owners
and
so
harassed
and
weary
but
lacking
spirit
to
oppose
her
own
feeble
inclinations
to
the
overpowering
force
of
pallinson
will
the
helpless
little
widow
went
submissively
wherever
they
chose
to
take
her
tormented
all
the
while
by
the
thought
of
john
saltram
coldness
and
wondering
when
this
cruel
time
of
probation
would
be
at
an
end
and
he
would
show
himself
her
devoted
slave
once
more
it
was
very
weak
and
foolish
to
think
of
him
like
this
no
doubt
undignified
and
unwomanly
perhaps
but
adela
branston
was
little
more
than
a
child
in
knowledge
of
the
world
and
john
saltram
was
the
only
man
who
had
ever
touched
her
heart
she
stood
quite
alone
in
the
world
too
lonely
with
all
her
wealth
and
there
was
no
one
to
share
her
affection
with
this
man
who
had
acquired
so
complete
an
influence
over
her
she
endured
the
dreary
course
of
her
days
patiently
enough
for
a
considerable
time
not
knowing
any
means
whereby
she
might
release
herself
from
the
society
of
her
kinswoman
or
put
an
end
to
the
indefatigable
attentions
of
the
popular
maida
hill
doctor
she
would
have
gladly
offered
pallinson
a
liberal
allowance
out
of
her
fortune
to
buy
that
lady
off
and
be
her
own
mistress
once
more
free
to
act
and
think
for
herself
had
she
dared
to
make
such
a
degrading
proposition
to
a
person
of
pallinson
dignity
but
she
could
not
venture
to
do
this
and
she
felt
that
no
one
but
john
saltram
in
the
character
of
her
future
husband
could
release
her
from
the
state
of
bondage
into
which
she
had
weakly
suffered
herself
to
fall
in
the
meantime
she
defended
the
man
she
loved
with
an
unflinching
spirit
resolutely
refusing
to
have
her
eyes
opened
to
the
worthlessness
of
his
character
and
boldly
declaring
her
disbelief
of
those
sad
accounts
which
theobald
affected
to
have
heard
from
acquaintance
of
his
own
respecting
the
follies
and
dissipations
of
saltram
career
his
debts
his
love
of
gambling
his
dealings
with
and
other
foibles
common
to
the
rake
progress
it
was
rather
a
hard
battle
for
the
lonely
little
woman
to
fight
but
she
had
fortune
on
her
side
and
at
the
worst
her
kinsfolk
treated
her
with
a
certain
deference
even
while
they
were
doing
their
utmost
to
worry
her
into
an
untimely
grave
if
little
flatteries
and
a
perpetual
indulgence
in
all
small
matters
such
as
a
foolish
nurse
might
give
to
a
spoilt
child
could
have
made
adela
happy
she
had
certainly
no
reason
to
complain
for
in
this
manner
pallinson
was
the
most
devoted
and
affectionate
of
companions
if
her
darling
adela
looked
a
little
paler
than
usual
or
confessed
to
suffering
from
a
headache
or
owned
to
being
nervous
or
out
of
spirits
pallinson
anxiety
knew
no
bounds
and
theobald
was
summoned
from
maida
hill
without
a
minute
delay
much
to
poor
adela
annoyance
indeed
she
grew
in
time
to
deny
the
headaches
and
the
low
spirits
or
the
nervousness
resolutely
rather
than
bring
upon
herself
a
visitation
from
theobald
pallinson
and
in
spite
of
all
this
care
and
indulgence
she
felt
herself
a
prisoner
in
her
own
house
somehow
more
dependent
than
the
humblest
servant
in
that
spacious
mansion
and
she
looked
out
helplessly
and
hopelessly
for
some
friend
through
whose
courageous
help
she
might
recover
her
freedom
perhaps
she
only
thought
of
one
champion
as
at
all
likely
to
come
to
her
rescue
indeed
her
mind
had
scarcely
room
for
more
than
that
one
image
which
occupied
her
thoughts
at
all
times
her
captivity
had
lasted
for
a
period
which
seemed
a
very
long
time
though
it
was
short
enough
when
computed
by
the
ordinary
standard
of
weeks
and
months
when
a
circumstance
occurred
which
gave
her
a
brief
interval
of
liberty
pallinson
fell
a
victim
to
some
slight
attack
of
low
fever
and
his
mother
who
was
really
most
devoted
to
this
paragon
of
a
son
retired
from
the
citadel
in
cavendish
square
for
a
few
days
in
order
to
nurse
him
it
was
not
that
the
surgeon
illness
was
in
any
way
dangerous
but
the
mother
could
not
trust
her
darling
to
the
care
of
strangers
and
hirelings
adela
branston
seemed
to
breathe
more
freely
in
that
brief
holiday
relieved
from
pallinson
dismal
presence
life
appeared
brighter
and
pleasanter
all
at
once
a
faint
colour
came
back
to
the
pale
cheeks
and
the
widow
was
even
beguiled
into
laughter
by
some
uncomplimentary
observations
which
her
confidential
maid
ventured
upon
with
reference
to
the
absent
lady
i
sure
the
house
itself
seems
lighter
and
more
without
her
said
this
young
person
who
was
of
a
vivacious
temperament
and
upon
whom
the
dowager
habitual
dreariness
had
been
a
heavy
affliction
and
you
looking
all
the
better
already
for
not
being
worried
by
her
berners
you
really
must
not
say
such
things
branston
exclaimed
reproachfully
you
ought
to
know
that
my
cousin
is
most
kind
and
thoughtful
and
does
everything
for
the
best
o
of
course
but
some
people
best
is
quite
as
bad
as
other
people
worst
the
maid
answered
sharply
and
as
to
kindness
and
thoughtfulness
pallinson
is
a
great
deal
too
kind
and
thoughtful
i
think
for
her
kindness
and
thoughtfulness
wo
allow
you
a
rest
and
then
as
if
anybody
could
see
through
her
schemes
about
that
precious
son
of
hers
with
his
finicking
affected
ways
and
at
this
point
the
vivacious
berners
gave
a
little
imitation
of
theobald
pallinson
with
which
liberty
adela
pretended
to
be
very
much
offended
laughing
at
the
performance
nevertheless
branston
passed
the
first
day
of
her
freedom
in
luxurious
idleness
it
was
such
an
inexpressible
relief
not
to
hear
the
perpetual
click
of
pallinson
needle
travelling
in
and
out
of
the
canvas
as
that
irreproachable
matron
sat
at
her
on
which
a
group
of
spaniels
after
sir
edwin
landseer
were
slowly
growing
into
the
fluffy
life
of
berlin
wool
a
still
greater
relief
not
to
be
called
upon
to
respond
appropriately
to
the
dull
platitudes
which
formed
the
usual
conversation
when
she
was
not
abusing
john
saltram
or
sounding
the
praises
of
her
beloved
son
the
day
was
a
long
one
for
adela
in
spite
of
the
pleasant
sense
of
freedom
for
she
had
begun
the
morning
with
the
thought
of
what
a
delightful
thing
it
would
be
if
some
happy
accident
should
bring
saltram
to
on
this
particular
day
and
having
once
started
with
this
idea
she
found
herself
counting
the
hours
and
with
impatient
watchfulness
until
the
orthodox
time
for
visiting
was
quite
over
and
she
could
no
longer
beguile
herself
with
the
hope
that
he
would
come
she
wanted
so
much
to
see
him
alone
since
her
husband
death
they
had
met
only
in
the
presence
of
pallinson
beneath
the
eye
and
within
perpetual
of
that
oppressive
matron
adela
fancied
that
if
they
could
only
meet
for
one
brief
face
to
face
without
the
restraint
of
that
foreign
presence
all
misunderstanding
would
be
at
an
end
between
them
and
john
saltram
affection
for
her
in
which
she
believed
with
a
fond
credulity
would
reveal
itself
in
all
its
truth
and
fulness
i
daresay
it
is
my
cousin
pallinson
who
has
kept
him
away
from
me
all
this
time
adela
said
to
herself
with
a
very
impatient
feeling
about
her
cousin
pallinson
i
know
how
intolerant
he
is
of
any
one
he
dislikes
and
no
doubt
he
has
taken
a
dislike
to
her
she
has
done
everything
to
provoke
it
indeed
by
her
coldness
and
rudeness
to
him
that
day
went
by
and
the
second
and
third
day
of
the
dowager
absence
but
there
was
no
sign
of
john
saltram
adela
thought
of
writing
to
ask
him
to
come
to
her
but
that
seemed
such
a
desperate
step
she
could
not
think
how
she
should
word
the
letter
or
how
she
could
give
it
to
one
of
the
servants
to
post
no
she
would
contrive
to
post
it
herself
if
she
did
bring
herself
to
write
and
then
she
thought
of
a
still
more
desperate
step
what
if
she
were
to
call
upon
saltram
at
his
temple
chambers
it
would
be
a
most
unwarrantable
thing
for
her
to
do
of
course
an
act
which
would
cause
pallinson
hair
to
stand
on
end
in
virtuous
horror
could
it
by
any
means
come
to
her
knowledge
but
adela
did
not
intend
that
it
ever
should
be
known
to
pallinson
and
about
the
opinion
of
the
world
in
the
abstract
branston
told
herself
that
she
cared
very
little
what
was
the
use
of
being
a
rich
widow
if
she
was
to
be
by
the
restrictions
which
encompass
the
steps
of
an
unwedded
damsel
just
beginning
life
emboldened
by
the
absence
of
her
dowager
kinswoman
branston
felt
herself
independent
free
to
do
a
foolish
thing
and
ready
to
abide
the
hazard
of
her
folly
so
upon
the
fourth
day
of
her
freedom
despairing
of
any
visit
from
john
saltram
adela
branston
ordered
the
butler
to
send
for
a
cab
much
to
the
surprise
of
that
portly
individual
josephs
has
just
been
round
asking
about
the
carriage
mum
he
said
in
a
kind
of
suggestive
way
whether
you
please
to
want
the
or
the
broom
and
whether
you
drive
before
or
after
luncheon
i
shall
not
want
the
carriage
this
morning
send
for
a
cab
if
you
please
parker
i
am
going
into
the
city
and
do
care
about
taking
the
horses
there
the
solemn
parker
bowed
and
retired
not
a
little
mystified
by
this
order
his
mistress
was
a
kind
little
woman
enough
but
such
extreme
consideration
for
equine
comfort
is
hardly
a
feminine
attribute
and
parker
was
puzzled
he
told
josephs
the
coachman
as
much
when
he
had
dispatched
an
underling
to
fetch
the
cleanest
procurable
at
an
adjacent
stand
she
to
her
banker
i
suppose
he
said
meditatively
going
to
make
some
new
investments
perhaps
women
are
always
and
chopping
and
changing
with
their
money
branston
kept
the
cab
waiting
half
an
hour
according
to
the
fairest
reckoning
she
was
very
particular
about
her
toilette
that
morning
and
inclined
to
be
discontented
with
the
sombre
plainness
of
her
garb
and
to
fancy
that
the
delicate
border
of
white
crape
round
her
girlish
face
made
her
look
pale
not
to
say
sallow
she
came
downstairs
at
last
however
looking
very
graceful
and
pretty
in
her
trailing
mourning
robes
and
fashionable
crape
bonnet
in
which
the
profoundest
depth
of
woe
was
made
to
express
itself
with
a
due
regard
to
elegance
she
came
down
to
the
homely
hackney
vehicle
attended
by
the
obsequious
berners
whose
curiosity
was
naturally
excited
by
this
solitary
expedition
where
shall
i
tell
the
man
to
drive
mum
the
butler
asked
with
the
in
his
hand
branston
felt
herself
blushing
and
hesitated
a
little
before
she
replied
the
union
bank
tell
him
to
go
by
the
strand
and
i
ca
think
what
come
to
my
mistress
miss
berners
remarked
as
the
cab
drove
off
catch
driving
in
one
of
those
nasty
vulgar
cabs
if
i
had
a
couple
of
carriages
and
a
couple
of
pairs
of
horses
at
my
disposal
there
some
style
about
a
hansom
but
i
never
could
abide
those
i
admire
your
taste
miss
berners
and
a
dashing
young
woman
like
a
credit
to
a
hansom
replied
parker
gallantly
but
there
no
accounting
for
the
vagaries
of
the
female
sex
and
i
fancy
somehow
did
want
any
of
us
to
know
where
she
was
going
she
so
when
i
asked
her
for
the
direction
you
may
depend
there
something
up
jane
berners
she
going
to
see
some
poor
relation
perhaps
or
way
and
was
ashamed
to
give
the
address
i
do
believe
she
has
any
relations
except
old
mother
pallinson
and
her
son
miss
berners
answered
and
thereupon
the
handmaiden
withdrew
to
her
own
regions
with
a
discontented
air
as
one
who
had
been
that
day
cheated
out
of
her
legitimate
rights
chapter
xxvii
only
a
woman
the
cabman
did
not
hurry
his
tall
steed
and
the
drive
to
seemed
a
very
long
one
to
adela
branston
whose
mind
was
disturbed
by
the
consciousness
that
she
was
doing
a
foolish
thing
many
times
during
the
journey
she
was
on
the
point
of
stopping
the
man
and
telling
him
to
drive
back
to
but
in
spite
of
these
moments
of
doubt
and
vacillation
she
suffered
the
vehicle
to
proceed
and
only
stopped
the
man
when
they
were
close
to
here
she
told
him
where
she
wanted
to
go
upon
which
he
plunged
down
an
obscure
side
street
and
stopped
at
one
of
the
entrances
to
the
temple
here
branston
alighted
and
had
to
inquire
her
way
to
chambers
she
was
so
unaccustomed
to
be
out
alone
that
this
expedition
seemed
something
almost
awful
to
her
when
she
found
herself
helpless
and
solitary
in
that
strange
locality
she
had
fancied
that
the
cab
would
drive
straight
to
saltram
door
the
busy
lawyers
flitting
across
those
grave
courts
and
passages
turned
to
glance
curiously
at
the
pretty
little
widow
she
had
the
air
of
a
person
not
used
to
be
on
foot
and
unattended
a
kind
of
aerial
butterfly
air
as
of
one
who
belonged
to
the
useless
and
ornamental
class
of
society
utterly
different
from
the
appearance
of
such
humble
female
pedestrians
as
were
wont
to
make
the
courts
and
alleys
of
the
temple
a
in
their
toilsome
journeys
to
and
fro
happily
a
porter
appeared
who
was
able
to
direct
her
to
saltram
chambers
and
civilly
offered
to
escort
her
there
for
which
service
she
rewarded
him
with
instead
of
the
sixpence
which
he
expected
as
his
maximum
recompense
she
was
so
glad
to
have
reached
the
shelter
of
the
dark
staircase
in
safety
the
men
whom
she
had
met
had
frightened
her
by
their
bold
admiring
stares
and
yet
she
was
pleased
to
think
that
she
was
looking
pretty
the
porter
did
not
leave
her
until
she
had
been
admitted
by
boy
and
then
retired
promising
to
be
in
the
way
to
see
her
back
to
her
carriage
how
the
poor
little
thing
trembled
when
she
found
herself
on
the
threshold
of
that
unfamiliar
door
what
a
horrible
dingy
lobby
it
was
and
how
she
pitied
john
saltram
for
having
to
live
in
such
place
he
was
at
home
and
alone
the
boy
told
her
would
she
please
to
send
in
her
card
no
branston
declined
to
send
in
her
card
the
boy
could
say
that
a
lady
wished
to
see
saltram
the
truth
was
she
wanted
to
surprise
this
man
to
see
how
her
presence
would
affect
him
she
fancied
herself
beloved
by
him
poor
soul
and
that
she
would
be
able
to
read
some
evidence
of
his
joy
at
seeing
her
in
this
unexpected
manner
the
boy
went
in
to
his
master
and
announced
the
advent
of
a
lady
the
first
he
had
ever
seen
in
those
dismal
premises
john
saltram
started
up
from
his
desk
and
came
with
a
hurried
step
to
the
door
very
pale
and
almost
breathless
a
lady
he
gasped
and
then
fell
back
a
pace
or
two
on
seeing
adela
with
a
look
which
was
very
much
like
disappointment
you
here
mrs
branston
he
exclaimed
i
you
are
the
last
person
in
the
world
i
should
have
expected
to
see
perhaps
he
felt
that
there
was
a
kind
of
rudeness
in
this
speech
for
he
added
hastily
and
with
a
faint
smile
of
course
i
am
not
the
less
honoured
by
your
visit
he
moved
a
chair
forward
the
least
dilapidated
of
the
three
or
four
which
formed
his
scanty
stock
and
placed
it
near
the
neglected
fire
which
he
tried
to
revive
a
little
by
a
judicious
use
of
the
poker
you
expected
to
see
some
one
else
i
think
adela
said
quite
unable
to
hide
her
wounded
feelings
she
had
seen
the
eagerness
in
his
pale
face
when
he
came
to
the
door
and
the
disappointed
look
with
which
he
had
recognised
her
scarcely
but
i
expected
to
receive
news
of
some
one
else
some
one
you
are
very
anxious
to
hear
about
i
should
imagine
from
your
manner
just
now
said
adela
who
could
not
forbear
pressing
the
question
a
little
yes
branston
some
one
about
whom
i
am
anxious
a
relation
in
short
she
looked
at
him
with
a
puzzled
air
she
had
never
heard
him
talk
of
his
relations
had
indeed
supposed
that
he
stood
almost
alone
in
the
world
but
there
was
no
reason
that
it
should
be
so
except
his
silence
on
the
subject
she
watched
him
for
some
moments
in
silence
as
he
stood
leaning
against
the
opposite
angle
of
the
waiting
for
her
to
speak
he
was
looking
very
ill
much
changed
since
she
had
seen
him
last
haggard
and
worn
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
not
slept
properly
for
many
nights
there
was
an
absent
look
in
his
eyes
and
adela
branston
felt
all
at
once
that
her
presence
was
nothing
to
him
that
this
desperate
step
which
she
had
taken
had
no
more
effect
upon
him
than
the
commonest
event
of
life
in
a
word
that
he
did
not
love
her
a
cold
deathlike
feeling
came
over
her
as
she
thought
this
she
had
set
her
heart
upon
this
man
love
and
had
indeed
some
justification
for
supposing
that
it
was
hers
it
seemed
to
her
that
life
was
useless
worse
than
useless
odious
and
unendurable
without
it
but
even
while
she
was
thinking
this
with
a
cold
blank
misery
in
her
heart
she
had
to
invent
some
excuse
for
this
unseemly
visit
i
have
waited
so
anxiously
for
you
to
call
she
said
at
last
in
a
nervous
hesitating
way
and
i
began
to
fear
that
you
must
be
ill
and
i
wished
to
consult
you
about
the
management
of
my
affairs
my
lawyers
worry
me
so
with
questions
which
i
do
know
how
to
answer
and
i
have
so
few
friends
in
the
world
whom
i
can
trust
except
you
so
at
last
i
screwed
up
my
courage
to
call
upon
you
i
am
deeply
honoured
by
your
confidence
branston
john
saltram
answered
looking
at
her
gravely
with
those
weary
haggard
eyes
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
brings
his
thoughts
back
to
common
life
from
some
region
with
an
effort
if
my
advice
or
assistance
can
be
of
any
use
to
you
they
are
completely
at
your
service
what
is
this
business
about
which
your
solicitor
bothers
you
i
explain
that
to
you
directly
adela
answered
taking
some
letters
from
her
how
good
you
are
i
knew
that
you
would
help
me
but
tell
me
first
why
you
have
never
been
to
in
all
this
long
time
i
fear
i
was
right
you
have
been
ill
have
you
not
not
exactly
ill
but
very
much
worried
and
overworked
a
light
dawned
on
adela
branston
troubled
mind
she
began
to
think
that
saltram
strange
absent
manner
his
apparent
indifference
to
her
presence
might
arise
from
preoccupation
caused
by
those
pecuniary
difficulties
from
which
the
pallinsons
declared
him
so
constant
a
sufferer
yes
she
told
herself
it
was
trouble
of
this
kind
that
oppressed
him
that
had
banished
him
from
her
all
this
time
he
was
too
generous
to
repair
his
shattered
fortunes
by
means
of
her
money
he
was
too
proud
to
confess
his
fallen
state
a
tender
pity
took
possession
of
her
all
that
was
most
sentimental
in
her
nature
was
awakened
by
the
idea
of
john
saltram
generosity
what
was
the
use
of
her
fortune
if
she
could
not
employ
it
for
the
relief
of
the
man
she
loved
you
are
so
kind
to
me
saltram
she
faltered
after
a
troubled
pause
so
ready
to
help
me
in
my
perplexities
i
only
wish
you
would
allow
me
to
be
of
some
use
to
you
in
yours
if
you
have
any
perplexities
and
i
suppose
everybody
has
of
some
kind
or
other
i
should
be
so
proud
if
you
would
give
me
your
confidence
so
proud
and
happy
her
voice
trembled
a
little
as
she
said
this
looking
up
at
him
all
the
while
with
soft
confiding
blue
eyes
the
fair
delicate
face
looking
its
prettiest
in
the
coquettish
widow
a
man
must
have
been
harder
of
heart
than
john
saltram
who
could
remain
unmoved
by
a
tenderness
so
evident
this
man
was
touched
and
deeply
the
pale
careworn
face
grew
more
troubled
the
lips
quivered
ever
so
little
as
he
looked
down
at
the
widow
pleading
countenance
and
then
he
turned
his
head
aside
with
a
sudden
movement
my
dear
branston
you
are
too
good
to
me
i
am
unworthy
i
am
in
every
way
unworthy
of
your
kindness
you
are
not
unworthy
and
that
is
no
answer
to
my
question
only
an
excuse
to
put
me
off
we
are
such
old
friends
saltram
you
might
trust
me
you
own
that
you
have
been
worried
overworked
worried
about
money
matters
perhaps
i
know
that
gentlemen
are
generally
subject
to
that
kind
of
annoyance
and
you
know
how
rich
i
am
how
little
employment
i
have
for
my
money
though
you
can
never
imagine
how
worthless
and
useless
it
seems
to
me
why
wo
you
trust
me
why
you
let
me
be
your
banker
she
blushed
crimson
as
she
made
this
offer
dreading
that
the
man
she
loved
would
turn
upon
her
fiercely
in
a
passion
of
offended
pride
she
sat
before
him
trembling
dreading
the
might
of
his
indignation
but
there
was
no
anger
in
john
saltram
face
when
he
looked
round
at
her
only
grief
and
an
expression
that
was
like
pity
the
offer
is
like
you
he
said
with
suppressed
feeling
but
the
worries
of
which
i
spoke
just
now
are
not
money
troubles
i
do
not
pretend
to
deny
that
my
affairs
are
embarrassed
and
have
been
for
so
long
that
entanglement
has
become
their
normal
state
but
if
they
were
ever
so
much
more
desperate
i
could
not
afford
to
trade
upon
your
generosity
no
branston
that
is
just
the
very
last
thing
in
this
world
that
i
could
consent
to
do
it
is
very
cruel
of
you
to
say
that
adela
answered
with
the
tears
gathering
in
her
clear
blue
eyes
and
with
a
little
childish
look
of
vexation
which
would
have
seemed
infinitely
charming
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
who
loved
her
there
can
be
no
reason
for
your
saying
this
except
that
you
do
not
think
me
worthy
of
your
confidence
that
you
despise
me
too
much
to
treat
me
like
a
friend
if
i
were
that
fenton
now
whom
you
care
for
so
much
you
would
not
treat
me
like
this
i
never
borrowed
a
sixpence
from
gilbert
fenton
in
my
life
though
i
know
that
his
purse
is
always
open
to
me
but
friendship
is
apt
to
end
when
money
transactions
begin
believe
me
i
feel
your
goodness
branston
your
womanly
generosity
but
it
is
my
own
unworthiness
that
comes
between
me
and
your
kindness
i
can
accept
nothing
from
you
but
the
sympathy
which
it
is
your
nature
to
give
to
all
who
need
it
i
do
indeed
sympathise
with
you
but
it
seems
so
hard
that
you
will
not
consent
to
make
some
use
of
all
that
money
which
is
lying
idle
it
would
make
me
so
happy
if
i
could
think
it
were
useful
to
you
but
i
dare
not
say
any
more
i
have
said
too
much
already
perhaps
only
i
hope
you
will
not
think
very
badly
of
me
for
having
acted
on
impulse
in
this
way
think
badly
of
you
my
dear
kind
soul
what
can
i
think
except
that
you
are
one
of
the
most
generous
of
women
and
about
these
other
troubles
saltram
which
have
no
relation
to
money
matters
you
will
not
give
me
your
confidence
there
is
nothing
that
i
can
confide
in
you
branston
others
are
involved
in
the
matter
of
which
i
spoke
i
am
not
free
to
talk
about
it
poor
adela
felt
herself
repulsed
at
every
point
it
seemed
very
hard
had
she
been
mistaken
about
this
man
all
the
time
mistaken
and
deluded
in
those
old
happy
days
during
her
husband
lifetime
when
he
had
been
so
constant
a
visitor
at
the
villa
and
had
seemed
exactly
what
a
man
might
seem
who
cherished
a
tenderness
which
he
dared
not
reveal
in
the
present
but
which
in
a
brighter
future
might
blossom
into
the
flower
of
love
and
now
about
your
own
affairs
my
dear
mrs
branston
john
saltram
said
with
a
forced
cheerfulness
drawing
his
chair
up
to
the
table
and
assuming
a
manner
these
tiresome
letters
of
your
lawyers
let
me
see
what
use
i
can
be
in
the
matter
adela
branston
produced
the
letters
with
rather
an
absent
air
they
were
letters
about
very
insignificant
affairs
the
renewal
of
a
lease
or
two
the
reinvestment
of
a
sum
of
money
that
had
been
lent
on
mortgage
and
had
fallen
in
lately
transactions
that
scarcely
called
for
the
employment
of
saltram
intellectual
powers
but
he
gave
them
very
serious
attention
nevertheless
well
aware
all
the
time
that
this
business
consultation
was
only
the
widow
excuse
for
her
visit
and
while
she
seemed
to
be
listening
to
his
advice
her
eyes
were
wandering
round
the
room
all
the
time
noting
the
dust
and
confusion
the
bottles
huddled
in
one
corner
the
pile
of
books
heaped
in
a
careless
mass
in
another
the
between
a
couple
of
stone
on
the
mantelpiece
she
was
thinking
what
a
dreary
place
it
was
and
that
there
was
the
stamp
of
decay
and
ruin
somehow
upon
the
man
who
occupied
it
and
she
loved
him
so
well
and
would
have
given
all
the
world
to
have
redeemed
his
life
it
is
doubtful
whether
adela
branston
heard
one
syllable
of
that
counsel
which
saltram
administered
so
gravely
her
mind
was
full
of
the
failure
of
this
desperate
step
which
she
had
taken
he
seemed
farther
from
her
now
than
before
they
had
met
obstinately
adverse
to
profit
by
her
friendship
cold
and
cruel
you
will
come
and
dine
with
us
very
soon
i
hope
she
said
as
she
rose
to
go
my
cousin
pallinson
will
be
home
in
a
day
or
two
she
has
been
nursing
her
son
for
the
last
few
days
but
he
is
much
better
and
i
expect
her
back
immediately
we
shall
be
so
pleased
to
see
you
you
will
name
an
early
day
wo
you
monday
shall
we
say
or
sunday
you
plead
business
on
sunday
my
dear
branston
i
really
am
not
well
enough
for
visiting
but
dining
with
us
does
not
come
under
the
head
of
visiting
we
will
be
quite
alone
if
you
wish
it
i
shall
be
hurt
if
you
refuse
to
come
if
you
put
it
in
that
way
i
can
not
refuse
but
i
fear
you
will
find
me
wretched
company
i
am
not
afraid
of
that
and
now
i
must
ask
you
to
forgive
me
for
having
wasted
so
much
of
your
time
before
i
say
there
has
been
no
time
of
mine
wasted
i
have
learned
to
know
your
generous
heart
even
better
than
i
knew
it
before
and
i
think
i
always
knew
that
it
was
a
noble
one
believe
me
i
am
not
ungrateful
or
indifferent
to
so
much
goodness
he
accompanied
her
downstairs
and
through
the
courts
and
passages
to
the
place
where
she
had
left
her
cab
in
spite
of
the
who
was
hanging
about
ready
to
act
as
escort
he
saw
her
safely
seated
in
the
hackney
vehicle
and
then
walked
slowly
back
to
his
chambers
thinking
over
the
interview
which
had
just
concluded
poor
little
soul
he
said
softly
to
himself
dear
little
soul
there
are
men
who
would
go
to
the
end
of
the
world
for
a
woman
like
that
yes
if
she
had
not
a
sixpence
and
to
think
that
i
who
thought
myself
so
strong
in
the
wisdom
of
the
world
should
have
let
such
a
prize
slip
through
my
fingers
for
what
for
a
fancy
for
a
caprice
that
has
brought
confusion
and
shame
upon
me
disappointment
and
regret
he
breathed
a
profound
sigh
from
first
to
last
life
had
been
more
or
less
a
disappointment
to
this
man
he
had
lived
alone
lived
for
himself
despising
the
ambitious
aims
and
lofty
hopes
of
other
men
thinking
the
best
prizes
this
world
can
give
scarcely
worth
that
long
struggle
which
is
so
apt
to
end
in
failure
perfect
success
was
so
rare
a
result
it
seemed
to
him
he
made
a
rough
calculation
of
his
chances
in
any
given
line
when
he
was
still
fresh
from
college
and
finding
the
figures
against
him
gave
up
all
thoughts
of
doing
great
things
when
his
creditors
grew
pressing
and
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
earn
money
in
some
way
he
found
that
it
was
no
trouble
to
him
to
write
so
he
wrote
with
a
spasmodic
kind
of
industry
but
a
power
when
he
chose
to
exercise
it
for
a
long
time
he
had
no
thought
of
winning
name
or
fame
in
literature
it
was
only
of
late
it
had
dawned
upon
him
that
he
had
wasted
labour
and
talent
out
of
which
a
wiser
man
would
have
created
for
himself
a
reputation
and
that
reputation
is
worth
something
if
only
as
a
means
of
making
money
this
conviction
once
arrived
at
he
had
worked
hard
at
a
book
which
he
thought
must
needs
make
some
impression
upon
the
world
whenever
he
could
afford
time
to
complete
it
in
the
meanwhile
his
current
work
occupied
so
much
of
his
life
that
he
was
fain
to
lay
the
aside
every
now
and
then
and
it
still
needed
a
month
or
two
of
quiet
labour
chapter
xxviii
at
fault
gilbert
fenton
took
up
his
abode
at
the
dilapidated
old
inn
at
crosber
thinking
that
he
might
be
freer
there
than
at
the
grange
a
dismal
place
of
sojourn
under
the
brightest
circumstances
but
unspeakably
dreary
for
him
who
had
only
the
saddest
thoughts
for
his
companions
he
wanted
to
be
on
the
spot
to
be
close
at
hand
to
hear
tidings
of
the
missing
girl
and
he
wanted
also
to
be
here
in
the
event
of
john
holbrook
return
to
come
face
to
face
with
this
man
if
possible
and
to
solve
that
question
which
had
sorely
perplexed
him
of
late
the
mystery
that
hung
about
the
man
who
had
wronged
him
he
consulted
ellen
carley
as
to
the
probability
of
holbrook
return
the
girl
seemed
to
think
it
very
unlikely
that
marian
husband
would
ever
again
appear
at
the
grange
his
last
departure
had
appeared
like
a
final
one
he
had
paid
every
sixpence
he
owed
in
the
neighbourhood
and
had
been
liberal
in
his
donations
to
the
servants
and
of
the
place
marian
belongings
he
had
left
to
ellen
carley
care
telling
her
to
pack
them
and
keep
them
in
readiness
for
being
forwarded
to
any
address
he
might
send
but
his
own
books
and
papers
he
had
carefully
removed
had
he
many
books
here
gilbert
asked
not
many
the
girl
answered
but
he
was
a
very
studious
gentleman
he
spent
almost
all
his
time
shut
up
in
his
own
room
reading
and
writing
indeed
in
this
respect
the
habits
of
the
unknown
corresponded
exactly
with
those
of
john
saltram
gilbert
fenton
heart
beat
a
little
quicker
at
the
thought
that
he
was
coming
nearer
by
a
step
to
the
solution
of
that
question
which
was
always
uppermost
in
his
mind
now
do
you
know
if
he
wrote
books
if
he
was
what
is
called
a
literary
man
living
by
his
pen
he
asked
presently
i
do
know
i
never
heard
his
wife
say
so
but
holbrook
was
always
reserved
about
him
and
his
history
i
think
he
had
forbidden
her
to
talk
about
his
affairs
i
know
i
used
to
fancy
it
was
a
dull
life
for
her
poor
soul
sitting
in
his
room
hour
after
hour
working
while
he
wrote
he
used
not
to
allow
her
to
be
with
him
at
all
at
first
but
little
by
little
she
persuaded
him
to
let
her
sit
with
him
promising
not
to
disturb
him
by
so
much
as
a
word
and
she
never
did
she
seemed
quite
happy
when
she
was
with
him
contented
and
proud
to
think
that
her
presence
was
no
hindrance
to
him
and
you
think
he
loved
her
do
you
at
first
yes
but
i
think
a
kind
of
weariness
came
over
him
afterwards
and
that
she
saw
it
and
almost
broke
her
heart
about
it
she
was
so
simple
and
innocent
poor
darling
it
was
easy
for
her
to
hide
anything
she
felt
gilbert
asked
the
bailiff
daughter
to
describe
holbrook
to
him
as
she
had
done
more
than
once
before
but
this
time
he
questioned
her
closely
and
contrived
that
her
description
of
this
man
outward
semblance
should
be
especially
minute
and
careful
yes
the
picture
which
arose
before
him
as
ellen
carley
spoke
was
the
picture
of
john
saltram
the
description
seemed
in
every
particular
to
apply
to
the
face
and
figure
of
his
one
chosen
friend
but
then
all
such
verbal
pictures
are
at
best
vague
and
shadowy
and
gilbert
knew
that
he
carried
that
one
image
in
his
mind
and
would
be
apt
unconsciously
to
twist
the
girl
words
into
that
one
shape
he
asked
if
any
picture
or
photograph
of
holbrook
had
been
left
at
the
grange
and
ellen
carley
told
him
no
she
had
never
even
seen
a
portrait
of
marian
husband
he
was
therefore
fain
to
be
content
with
the
description
which
seemed
so
exactly
to
fit
the
friend
he
loved
the
friend
to
whom
he
had
clung
with
a
deeper
stronger
feeling
since
this
miserable
suspicion
had
taken
root
in
his
mind
i
think
i
could
have
forgiven
him
if
he
had
come
between
us
in
a
bold
and
open
way
he
said
to
himself
brooding
over
this
harassing
doubt
of
his
friend
yes
i
think
i
could
have
forgiven
him
in
spite
of
the
bitterness
of
losing
her
but
to
steal
her
from
me
with
cowardly
treacherous
secrecy
to
hide
my
treasure
in
an
obscure
corner
and
then
grow
weary
of
her
and
blight
her
fair
young
life
with
his
coldness
can
i
forgive
him
these
things
can
all
the
memory
of
the
past
plead
with
me
for
him
when
i
think
of
these
things
o
god
grant
that
i
am
mistaken
that
it
is
some
other
man
who
has
done
this
and
not
john
saltram
not
the
man
i
have
loved
and
honoured
for
fifteen
years
of
my
life
but
his
suspicions
were
not
to
be
put
away
not
to
be
driven
out
of
his
mind
let
him
argue
against
them
as
he
might
he
resolved
therefore
that
as
soon
as
he
should
have
made
every
effort
and
taken
every
possible
means
towards
the
recovery
of
the
missing
girl
he
would
make
it
his
business
next
to
bring
this
thing
home
to
john
saltram
or
acquit
him
for
ever
it
is
needless
to
dwell
upon
that
weary
work
which
seemed
destined
to
result
in
nothing
but
disappointment
the
local
constabulary
and
the
london
police
alike
exerted
all
their
powers
to
obtain
some
trace
of
marian
holbrook
lost
footsteps
but
no
clue
to
the
painful
mystery
was
to
be
found
from
the
moment
when
she
vanished
from
the
eyes
of
the
watching
her
departure
from
the
grange
gate
she
seemed
to
have
disappeared
altogether
from
the
sight
of
mankind
if
by
some
witchcraft
she
had
melted
into
the
dim
autumnal
mist
that
hung
about
the
she
could
not
have
left
less
trace
or
vanished
more
mysteriously
than
she
had
done
the
local
constabulary
gave
in
very
soon
in
spite
of
gilbert
fenton
handsome
payment
in
the
present
and
noble
promises
of
reward
in
the
future
the
local
constabulary
were
honest
and
uninventive
they
shook
their
heads
gloomily
and
said
drownded
but
the
river
has
been
dragged
gilbert
cried
eagerly
and
there
has
been
nothing
found
he
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
that
which
might
have
been
hauled
to
shore
in
the
foul
weedy
net
the
face
he
loved
changed
disfigured
awful
the
damp
clinging
hair
holes
replied
the
chief
of
the
local
constabulary
sententiously
there
holes
in
that
there
river
where
you
might
hide
half
a
dozen
drownded
men
and
never
hope
to
find
no
more
than
if
they
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
atlantic
ocean
lord
bless
your
heart
sir
you
londoners
do
know
what
a
river
is
in
a
manner
of
speaking
added
the
man
who
was
most
likely
unacquainted
with
the
existence
of
the
thames
compared
with
which
noble
stream
this
sluggish
hampshire
river
was
the
veriest
ditch
i
known
a
many
poor
creatures
drownded
in
that
river
and
never
one
of
to
come
to
light
not
that
the
river
was
dragged
for
their
friends
were
of
the
dragging
class
they
were
the
london
police
were
more
hopeful
and
more
delusive
they
were
always
hearing
of
some
young
lady
newly
arrived
at
some
neighbouring
town
or
village
who
seemed
to
answer
exactly
to
the
description
of
holbrook
and
behold
when
gilbert
fenton
hurried
off
to
the
village
or
town
and
presented
himself
before
the
lady
in
question
he
found
for
the
most
part
that
she
was
ten
years
older
than
marian
and
as
utterly
unlike
her
as
it
was
possible
for
one
englishwoman
to
be
unlike
another
he
possessed
a
portrait
of
the
missing
girl
a
carefully
finished
photograph
which
had
been
given
to
him
in
the
brief
happy
time
when
she
was
his
promised
wife
and
he
caused
this
image
to
be
multiplied
and
distributed
wherever
the
search
for
marian
was
being
made
he
neglected
no
possible
means
by
which
he
might
hope
to
obtain
tidings
advertising
continually
in
town
and
country
and
varying
his
advertisements
in
such
a
manner
as
to
insure
attention
either
from
the
object
of
his
inquiries
or
any
one
acquainted
with
her
but
all
his
trouble
was
in
vain
no
reply
or
what
was
worse
worthless
and
delusive
replies
came
to
his
advertisements
the
london
police
who
had
pretended
to
be
so
hopeful
at
first
began
to
despair
in
a
visible
manner
having
put
all
their
machinery
into
play
and
failed
to
obtain
even
the
most
insignificant
result
they
were
fain
to
confess
at
last
that
they
could
only
come
to
pretty
much
the
same
conclusion
as
that
arrived
at
by
their
inferiors
the
rustic
officials
and
agreed
that
in
all
probability
the
river
hid
the
secret
of
marian
holbrook
fate
she
had
been
the
victim
of
either
crime
or
accident
who
should
say
which
the
former
seemed
the
more
likely
as
she
had
vanished
in
broad
daylight
when
it
was
scarcely
possible
that
her
footsteps
could
go
astray
while
in
that
lonely
neighbourhood
a
crime
was
never
impossible
she
had
a
watch
and
chain
i
suppose
the
officer
inquired
ladies
will
wear
gilbert
ascertained
from
ellen
carley
that
marian
had
always
worn
her
watch
and
chain
had
worn
them
when
she
left
the
grange
for
the
last
time
she
had
a
few
other
trinkets
too
which
she
wore
habitually
quaint
things
of
some
value
how
well
gilbert
remembered
those
little
family
treasures
which
she
had
exhibited
to
him
at
captain
sedgewick
bidding
ah
muttered
the
officer
when
he
heard
this
quite
enough
to
cost
her
her
life
if
she
met
with
one
of
your
ugly
customers
i
known
a
murder
committed
for
the
sake
of
in
my
time
and
pushing
a
young
woman
into
the
river
do
count
for
murder
among
that
sort
of
people
you
see
some
one
may
come
by
and
fish
her
out
again
so
it
well
be
more
than
manslaughter
a
dull
horror
came
over
gilbert
fenton
as
he
heard
these
professional
speculations
but
at
the
worst
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
that
these
men
were
right
and
that
the
woman
he
loved
had
been
the
victim
of
some
obscure
wretch
greed
slain
in
broad
daylight
for
the
sake
of
a
few
pounds
worth
of
jewelry
when
everything
had
been
done
that
was
possible
to
be
done
in
that
part
of
the
country
fenton
went
back
to
london
but
not
before
he
had
become
very
familiar
with
the
household
at
the
grange
from
the
first
he
had
liked
and
trusted
ellen
carley
deeply
touched
by
her
fidelity
to
marian
he
made
a
point
of
dropping
in
at
the
grange
every
evening
when
not
away
from
crosber
following
up
some
delusive
track
started
by
his
metropolitan
counsellors
he
always
went
there
with
a
faint
hope
that
ellen
carley
might
have
something
to
tell
him
and
with
a
vague
notion
that
john
holbrook
might
return
unexpectedly
and
that
they
two
might
meet
in
the
old
but
holbrook
did
not
reappear
nor
had
ellen
any
tidings
for
her
evening
visitor
though
she
thought
of
little
else
than
marian
and
never
let
a
day
pass
without
making
some
small
effort
to
obtain
a
clue
to
that
mystery
which
now
seemed
so
hopeless
gilbert
grew
to
be
quite
at
home
in
the
little
wainscoted
parlour
at
the
grange
smoking
his
cigar
there
nightly
in
a
tranquil
contemplative
mood
while
carley
puffed
vigorously
at
his
long
clay
pipe
there
was
a
special
charm
for
him
in
the
place
that
had
so
long
been
marian
home
he
felt
nearer
to
her
somehow
under
that
roof
and
as
if
he
must
needs
be
on
the
right
road
to
some
discovery
the
bailiff
although
prone
to
silence
seemed
to
derive
considerable
gratification
from
visits
and
talked
to
that
gentleman
with
greater
freedom
than
he
was
wont
to
display
in
his
intercourse
with
mankind
ellen
was
not
always
present
during
the
whole
of
the
evening
and
in
her
absence
the
bailiff
would
unbosom
himself
to
gilbert
on
the
subject
of
his
undutiful
conduct
telling
him
what
a
prosperous
marriage
the
girl
might
make
if
she
had
only
common
sense
enough
to
see
her
own
interests
in
the
right
light
and
was
the
most
obstinate
hussy
that
ever
set
her
own
foolish
whims
and
fancies
against
a
father
wishes
but
a
woman
fancies
sometimes
mean
a
very
deep
feeling
carley
pleaded
gilbert
and
what
people
call
a
good
home
is
not
always
a
happy
one
it
a
hard
thing
for
a
young
woman
to
marry
against
her
inclination
humph
muttered
the
bailiff
in
a
surly
tone
it
a
harder
thing
for
her
to
marry
a
pauper
i
should
think
and
to
bring
a
regiment
of
children
into
the
world
always
wanting
shoes
and
stockings
but
you
a
bachelor
you
see
fenton
and
ca
be
expected
to
know
what
shoes
and
stockings
are
now
there
happens
to
be
a
friend
of
mine
a
steady
respectable
man
who
worships
the
ground
my
girl
walks
on
and
could
make
her
mistress
of
as
good
a
house
as
any
within
twenty
miles
of
this
and
give
a
home
to
her
father
in
his
old
age
into
the
bargain
for
i
only
a
servant
here
and
it
ca
be
expected
that
i
am
to
go
on
toiling
and
slaving
about
this
place
for
ever
i
do
say
but
what
saved
a
few
pounds
but
i
have
saved
enough
to
keep
me
out
of
the
workhouse
this
seemed
to
gilbert
rather
a
selfish
manner
of
looking
at
a
matrimonial
prospects
and
he
ventured
to
hint
as
much
in
a
polite
way
but
the
bailiff
was
immovable
what
a
young
woman
wants
is
a
good
home
he
said
decisively
whether
she
has
the
sense
to
know
it
herself
or
whether
she
has
that
what
she
got
to
look
for
in
life
gilbert
had
not
spent
many
evenings
at
the
grange
before
he
had
the
honour
of
being
introduced
to
the
estimable
suitor
whose
claims
carley
was
always
setting
forth
to
his
daughter
he
saw
stephen
whitelaw
and
that
individual
colourless
expressionless
countenance
redeemed
from
total
blankness
only
by
the
cunning
visible
in
the
small
grey
eyes
impressed
him
with
instant
distrust
and
dislike
god
forbid
that
frank
girl
should
ever
be
sacrificed
to
such
a
fellow
as
this
he
said
to
himself
as
he
sat
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hearth
smoking
his
cigar
and
meditatively
contemplating
whitelaw
conversing
in
his
slow
solemn
fashion
with
the
man
who
was
so
eager
to
be
his
in
the
course
of
that
first
evening
of
their
acquaintance
gilbert
was
surprised
to
see
how
often
stephen
whitelaw
looked
at
him
with
a
expression
that
had
something
furtive
in
it
some
hidden
meaning
as
it
seemed
to
him
whenever
gilbert
spoke
the
farmer
looked
up
at
him
always
with
the
same
sharp
inquisitive
glance
the
same
cunning
twinkle
in
his
small
eyes
and
every
time
he
happened
to
look
at
whitelaw
during
that
evening
he
found
the
watchful
eyes
turned
towards
him
in
the
same
unpleasant
manner
the
sensation
caused
by
this
kind
of
surveillance
on
the
part
of
the
farmer
was
so
obnoxious
to
him
that
at
parting
he
took
occasion
to
speak
of
it
in
a
friendly
way
i
fancy
you
and
i
must
have
met
before
whitelaw
he
said
or
that
you
must
have
some
notion
to
that
effect
you
looked
at
me
with
an
amount
of
interest
my
personal
merits
could
scarcely
call
for
no
no
sir
the
farmer
answered
in
his
usual
slow
deliberate
way
it
is
that
i
never
set
eyes
on
you
before
i
came
into
this
room
but
you
see
ellen
she
interested
in
you
and
i
take
an
interest
in
any
one
she
takes
to
and
we
all
of
us
thought
so
much
about
your
searching
for
that
poor
young
lady
that
missing
and
taking
such
pains
and
being
so
where
another
would
have
given
in
at
the
first
so
altogether
you
a
general
object
of
interest
you
see
gilbert
did
not
appear
particularly
flattered
by
this
compliment
he
received
it
at
first
with
rather
an
angry
look
and
then
after
a
pause
was
vexed
with
himself
for
having
been
annoyed
by
the
man
clumsy
expression
of
sympathy
for
it
was
sympathy
no
doubt
which
whitelaw
wished
to
express
it
has
been
sad
work
so
far
he
said
i
suppose
you
can
give
me
no
hint
no
kind
of
advice
as
to
any
step
to
be
taken
in
the
future
lord
bless
you
no
sir
everything
that
could
be
done
was
done
before
you
came
here
holbrook
did
leave
a
stone
unturned
he
did
his
duty
as
a
man
and
a
husband
sir
the
poor
young
lady
was
drowned
there
no
doubt
about
that
i
do
believe
it
gilbert
said
with
a
quiet
resolute
air
which
seemed
quite
to
startle
whitelaw
you
do
believe
she
was
drowned
you
mean
to
say
you
think
alive
then
he
asked
with
unusual
sharpness
and
quickness
of
speech
i
have
a
firm
conviction
that
she
still
lives
that
with
blessing
i
shall
see
her
again
well
sir
whitelaw
replied
relapsing
into
his
accustomed
slowness
and
rubbing
his
clumsy
chin
with
his
still
clumsier
hand
in
a
thoughtful
manner
of
course
it
ai
my
place
to
go
against
any
gentleman
convictions
far
from
it
but
if
you
see
holbrook
before
the
dead
rise
out
of
their
graves
my
name
is
stephen
whitelaw
you
may
waste
your
time
and
your
trouble
and
you
may
spend
your
money
as
it
was
so
much
water
but
set
eyes
upon
that
missing
lady
you
never
will
take
my
word
for
it
or
do
take
my
word
for
it
as
you
please
gilbert
wondered
at
the
man
earnestness
did
he
really
feel
some
kind
of
benevolent
interest
in
the
fate
of
a
helpless
woman
or
was
it
only
a
vulgar
love
of
the
marvellous
and
horrible
that
moved
him
gilbert
leaned
to
the
latter
opinion
and
was
by
no
means
inclined
to
give
stephen
whitelaw
credit
for
any
surplus
stock
of
benevolence
he
saw
a
good
deal
more
of
ellen
carley
suitor
in
the
course
of
his
evening
visits
to
the
grange
and
had
ample
opportunity
for
observing
whitelaw
mode
of
courtship
which
was
by
no
means
of
the
demonstrative
order
consisting
in
a
polite
silence
towards
the
object
of
his
affections
broken
only
by
one
or
two
clumsy
but
florid
compliments
delivered
in
a
deliberate
but
manner
the
owner
of
wyncomb
farm
had
no
idea
of
making
hard
work
of
his
courtship
he
had
been
angled
for
by
so
many
damsels
and
courted
by
so
many
fathers
and
mothers
that
he
fancied
he
had
but
to
say
the
word
when
the
time
came
and
the
thing
would
be
done
any
evidence
of
avoidance
indifference
or
even
dislike
upon
ellen
carley
part
troubled
him
in
the
smallest
degree
he
had
heard
people
talk
of
young
randall
fancy
for
her
and
of
her
liking
for
him
but
he
knew
that
her
father
meant
to
set
his
heel
upon
any
nonsense
of
this
kind
and
he
did
not
for
a
moment
imagine
it
possible
that
any
girl
would
resolutely
oppose
her
father
will
and
throw
away
such
good
fortune
as
he
could
offer
her
to
ride
in
her
own
and
wear
a
silk
gown
always
on
sundays
to
say
nothing
of
a
gold
watch
and
chain
and
whitelaw
meant
to
endow
his
bride
with
a
ponderous
timepiece
and
heavy
cable
which
had
belonged
to
his
mother
chapter
xxix
baffled
not
beaten
the
time
came
when
gilbert
fenton
was
fain
to
own
to
himself
that
there
was
no
more
to
be
done
down
in
hampshire
professional
science
and
his
own
efforts
had
been
alike
futile
if
she
whom
he
sought
still
lived
and
he
had
never
for
a
moment
suffered
himself
to
doubt
this
it
was
more
than
likely
that
she
was
far
away
from
crosber
grange
that
there
had
been
some
motive
for
her
sudden
flight
unaccountable
as
that
flight
might
seem
in
the
absence
of
any
clue
to
the
mystery
every
means
of
inquiry
being
exhausted
in
hampshire
there
was
nothing
left
to
gilbert
but
to
return
to
london
that
marvellous
city
where
there
always
seems
the
most
hope
of
finding
the
lost
wide
as
the
wilderness
is
in
london
i
shall
have
clever
detectives
always
at
my
service
gilbert
thought
in
london
i
may
be
able
to
solve
the
question
of
john
holbrook
identity
so
apart
from
the
fact
that
his
own
affairs
necessitated
his
prompt
return
to
the
great
city
gilbert
had
another
motive
for
leaving
the
dull
rural
neighbourhood
where
he
had
wasted
so
many
anxious
hours
so
much
thought
and
care
for
the
rest
he
knew
that
ellen
carley
would
be
faithful
always
on
the
watch
for
any
clue
to
the
mystery
of
marian
holbrook
fate
always
ready
to
receive
the
wanderer
with
open
arms
should
any
happy
chance
bring
her
back
to
the
grange
assured
of
this
he
felt
less
compunction
in
turning
his
back
upon
the
spot
where
his
lost
love
had
vanished
from
the
eyes
of
men
before
leaving
he
gave
ellen
a
letter
for
marian
husband
in
the
improbable
event
of
that
gentleman
reappearance
at
the
grange
a
few
simple
earnest
lines
entreating
holbrook
to
believe
in
the
faithful
and
brotherly
affection
for
his
wife
and
to
meet
him
in
london
on
an
early
occasion
in
order
that
they
might
together
concert
fresh
means
for
bringing
about
her
restoration
to
her
husband
and
home
he
reminded
holbrook
of
his
friendship
for
captain
sedgewick
and
that
good
man
confidence
in
him
and
declared
himself
bound
by
his
respect
for
the
dead
to
be
faithful
to
the
living
faithful
in
all
forgiveness
of
any
wrong
done
him
in
the
past
he
went
back
to
london
cruelly
depressed
by
the
failure
of
his
efforts
and
with
a
blank
dreary
feeling
that
there
was
little
more
for
him
to
do
except
to
wait
the
working
of
providence
with
the
faint
hope
that
one
of
those
happy
accidents
which
sometimes
bring
about
a
desired
result
when
all
human
endeavour
has
been
in
vain
might
throw
a
sudden
light
on
marian
holbrook
fate
during
the
whole
of
that
homeward
journey
he
brooded
an
those
dark
suspicions
of
holbrook
which
ellen
carley
had
let
fall
in
their
earlier
interviews
he
had
checked
the
girl
on
these
occasions
and
had
prevented
the
full
utterance
of
her
thoughts
generously
indignant
that
any
suspicion
of
foul
play
should
attach
to
marian
husband
and
utterly
incredulous
of
such
a
depth
of
guilt
as
that
at
which
the
girl
hints
pointed
but
now
that
he
was
leaving
hampshire
he
felt
vexed
with
himself
for
not
having
urged
her
to
speak
freely
not
having
considered
her
suspicions
however
preposterous
those
suspicions
might
have
appeared
to
him
marian
disappearance
had
taken
a
darker
colour
in
his
mind
since
that
time
granted
that
she
had
left
the
grange
of
her
own
accord
having
some
special
reason
for
leaving
secretly
at
whose
bidding
would
she
have
so
acted
except
her
husband
she
who
stood
so
utterly
alone
without
a
friend
in
the
world
but
what
possible
motive
could
holbrook
have
had
for
such
an
underhand
course
for
making
a
conspiracy
and
a
mystery
out
of
so
simple
a
fact
as
the
removal
of
his
wife
from
a
place
whence
he
was
free
to
remove
her
at
any
moment
fair
and
honest
motive
for
such
a
course
there
could
be
none
was
it
possible
looking
at
the
business
from
a
darker
point
of
view
to
imagine
any
guilty
reason
for
the
carrying
out
of
such
a
plot
if
this
man
had
wanted
to
bring
about
a
severance
between
himself
and
his
wife
to
put
her
away
somewhere
to
keep
her
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
the
world
in
plainer
words
to
get
rid
of
her
might
not
this
pretence
of
losing
her
this
affectation
of
distress
at
her
loss
be
a
safe
way
of
accomplishing
his
purpose
who
else
was
interested
in
doing
her
any
wrong
who
else
could
have
had
sufficient
power
over
her
to
beguile
her
away
from
her
home
pondering
on
these
questions
throughout
all
that
weary
journey
across
a
wintry
landscape
of
bare
brown
fields
and
leafless
trees
gilbert
fenton
travelled
to
the
city
which
was
so
little
of
a
home
for
him
but
in
which
his
life
had
seemed
pleasant
enough
in
its
own
commonplace
fashion
until
that
fatal
summer
evening
when
he
first
saw
marian
nowell
radiant
face
in
the
quiet
church
at
lidford
he
scarcely
stopped
to
eat
or
drink
at
the
end
of
his
journey
regaling
himself
only
with
a
bottle
of
imperceptibly
flavoured
with
cognac
by
the
hands
of
a
ministering
angel
at
the
of
the
waterloo
station
and
then
hurrying
on
at
once
in
a
hansom
to
that
dingy
street
in
soho
where
medler
sat
in
his
parlour
like
the
proverbial
spider
waiting
for
the
advent
of
some
fly
the
lawyer
was
at
home
and
seemed
in
no
way
surprised
to
see
fenton
i
have
come
to
you
about
a
bad
business
medler
gilbert
began
seating
himself
opposite
the
with
its
covering
of
dusty
faded
baize
upon
which
there
seemed
to
be
always
precisely
the
same
array
of
papers
in
little
bundles
tied
with
red
tape
but
first
let
me
ask
you
a
question
have
you
heard
from
mrs
holbrook
not
a
line
and
have
you
taken
no
further
steps
no
other
means
of
communicating
with
her
gilbert
asked
not
yet
i
think
of
sending
my
clerk
down
to
hampshire
or
of
going
down
myself
perhaps
in
a
day
or
two
if
my
business
engagements
will
permit
me
do
you
not
consider
the
case
rather
an
urgent
one
medler
i
should
have
supposed
that
your
curiosity
would
have
been
aroused
by
the
absence
of
any
reply
to
your
letters
that
you
would
have
looked
at
the
business
in
a
more
serious
light
than
you
appear
to
have
done
that
you
would
have
taken
alarm
in
short
why
should
i
do
so
the
lawyer
demanded
carelessly
it
is
holbrook
business
to
look
after
her
affairs
the
property
is
safe
enough
she
can
administer
to
the
will
as
soon
as
she
pleases
i
certainly
wonder
that
the
husband
has
not
been
a
little
sharper
and
more
active
in
the
business
you
have
heard
nothing
of
him
then
i
presume
nothing
gilbert
remembered
what
ellen
carley
had
told
him
about
marian
keeping
the
secret
of
her
fortune
from
her
husband
until
she
should
be
able
to
tell
it
to
him
with
her
own
lips
waiting
for
that
happy
moment
with
innocent
girlish
delight
in
the
thought
that
he
was
to
owe
prosperity
to
her
it
seemed
evident
therefore
that
holbrook
could
know
nothing
of
his
wife
inheritance
nor
of
medler
existence
supposing
the
letter
to
have
reached
the
grange
before
marian
disappearance
and
to
have
been
destroyed
or
carried
away
by
her
he
inquired
the
date
of
this
letter
whereupon
medler
referred
to
a
in
which
there
was
a
facsimile
of
the
document
it
had
been
posted
three
days
before
marian
left
the
grange
gilbert
now
proceeded
to
inform
medler
of
his
client
mysterious
disappearance
and
all
the
useless
efforts
that
had
been
made
to
solve
the
mystery
the
lawyer
listened
with
an
appearance
of
profound
interest
and
astonishment
but
made
no
remark
till
the
story
was
quite
finished
you
are
right
fenton
he
said
at
last
it
is
a
bad
business
a
very
bad
business
may
i
ask
you
what
is
the
common
opinion
among
people
in
that
part
of
the
world
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
event
as
to
this
poor
lady
fate
an
opinion
with
which
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
agree
an
opinion
which
i
pray
god
may
prove
as
unfounded
as
i
believe
it
to
be
it
is
generally
thought
that
holbrook
has
fallen
a
victim
to
some
common
crime
that
she
was
robbed
and
then
thrown
into
the
river
the
river
has
been
dragged
i
suppose
it
has
but
the
people
about
there
seem
to
consider
that
no
conclusive
test
had
holbrook
anything
valuable
about
her
at
the
time
of
her
disappearance
her
watch
and
chain
and
a
few
other
trinkets
humph
there
are
scoundrels
about
the
country
who
will
commit
the
darkest
crime
for
the
smallest
inducement
i
confess
the
business
has
rather
a
black
look
fenton
and
that
i
am
inclined
to
concur
with
the
country
people
an
easy
way
of
settling
the
question
for
those
not
vitally
interested
in
the
lady
fate
gilbert
answered
bitterly
the
lady
is
my
client
sir
and
i
am
bound
to
feel
a
warm
interest
in
her
affairs
the
lawyer
said
with
the
lofty
tone
of
a
man
whose
finer
feelings
have
been
outraged
the
lady
was
once
my
promised
wife
medler
returned
gilbert
and
now
stands
to
me
in
the
place
of
a
beloved
and
only
sister
for
me
the
mystery
of
her
fate
is
an
question
an
enigma
to
the
solution
of
which
i
mean
to
devote
the
rest
of
my
life
if
need
be
a
wasted
life
fenton
and
in
the
meantime
that
river
down
yonder
may
hide
the
only
secret
o
god
cried
gilbert
passionately
how
eager
every
one
is
to
make
an
end
of
this
business
even
the
men
whom
i
paid
and
bribed
to
help
me
grew
tired
of
their
work
and
abandoned
all
hope
after
the
feeblest
most
miserable
attempts
to
earn
their
reward
what
can
be
done
in
such
a
case
mr
fenton
demanded
the
lawyer
shrugging
his
shoulders
with
a
deprecating
air
what
can
the
police
do
more
than
you
or
i
they
have
only
a
little
more
experience
that
all
they
have
no
recondite
means
of
solving
these
social
mysteries
you
have
advertised
of
course
yes
in
many
channels
with
a
certain
amount
of
caution
but
in
such
a
manner
as
to
insure
holbrook
identification
if
she
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
any
one
willing
to
communicate
with
me
and
to
insure
her
own
attention
were
she
free
to
act
for
herself
humph
then
it
seems
to
me
that
everything
has
been
done
that
can
be
done
not
yet
the
men
whom
i
employed
in
hampshire
they
were
recommended
to
me
by
the
authorities
certainly
may
not
have
been
up
to
the
mark
in
any
case
i
shall
try
some
one
else
do
you
know
anything
of
the
detective
force
medler
assumed
an
air
of
consideration
and
then
said
no
he
did
not
know
the
name
of
a
single
detective
his
business
did
not
bring
him
in
contact
with
that
class
of
people
he
said
this
with
the
tone
of
a
man
whose
practice
was
of
the
loftiest
and
choicest
kind
conveyancing
perhaps
and
the
management
of
estates
for
the
landed
gentry
involving
the
disposition
of
large
fortunes
and
so
on
whereas
medler
business
lying
chiefly
among
the
criminal
population
his
path
in
life
might
have
been
supposed
to
be
not
very
remote
from
the
footsteps
of
eminent
i
can
get
the
information
elsewhere
gilbert
said
carelessly
believe
me
i
do
not
mean
to
let
this
matter
drop
my
dear
sir
if
i
might
venture
upon
a
word
of
friendly
advice
not
in
a
professional
spirit
but
as
between
man
and
man
i
should
warn
you
against
wasting
your
time
and
fortune
upon
a
useless
pursuit
if
holbrook
has
vanished
from
the
world
of
her
own
free
will
a
thing
that
often
happens
eccentric
as
it
may
be
she
will
reappear
in
good
time
of
her
own
free
will
if
she
has
been
the
victim
of
a
crime
that
crime
will
no
doubt
come
to
light
in
due
course
without
any
efforts
of
yours
that
is
the
common
kind
of
advice
medler
answered
gilbert
prudent
counsel
no
doubt
if
a
man
could
be
content
to
take
it
and
well
meant
but
you
see
i
have
loved
this
lady
love
her
still
and
shall
continue
so
to
love
her
till
the
end
of
my
life
it
is
not
possible
for
me
to
rest
in
ignorance
of
her
fate
although
she
jilted
you
in
favour
of
mr
holbrook
suggested
the
lawyer
with
something
of
a
sneer
that
wrong
has
been
forgiven
fate
did
not
permit
me
to
be
her
husband
but
i
can
be
her
friend
and
brother
she
has
need
of
some
one
to
stand
in
that
position
poor
girl
for
her
lot
is
very
lonely
and
now
i
want
you
to
explain
the
conditions
of
her
grandfather
will
it
is
her
father
who
would
profit
i
think
i
gathered
from
our
last
conversation
in
the
event
of
marian
death
in
the
event
of
her
dying
childless
yes
the
father
would
take
all
then
he
is
really
the
only
person
who
could
profit
by
her
death
well
yes
replied
the
lawyer
with
some
slight
hesitation
under
her
grandfather
will
yes
her
father
would
take
all
of
course
in
the
event
of
her
father
having
died
previously
the
husband
would
come
in
as
you
see
it
was
not
easy
to
exclude
the
husband
altogether
and
do
you
believe
that
nowell
is
still
living
to
claim
his
inheritance
i
believe
so
i
fancy
the
old
man
had
some
tidings
of
his
son
before
the
will
was
executed
that
he
in
short
heard
of
his
having
been
met
with
not
long
ago
over
in
america
no
doubt
he
will
speedily
put
in
an
appearance
now
said
gilbert
bitterly
now
that
there
is
a
fortune
to
be
gained
by
the
assertion
of
his
identity
humph
muttered
the
lawyer
it
would
not
be
very
easy
for
him
to
put
his
hand
on
sixpence
of
jacob
nowell
money
in
the
absence
of
any
proof
of
holbrook
death
there
would
be
no
end
of
appeals
to
the
court
of
chancery
and
after
all
manner
of
formulas
he
might
obtain
a
decree
that
would
lock
up
the
property
for
years
i
doubt
if
the
executor
chose
to
stick
to
technicals
and
the
business
got
into
chancery
whether
percival
nowell
would
live
long
enough
to
profit
by
his
father
will
i
am
glad
of
that
said
gilbert
i
know
the
man
to
be
a
scoundrel
and
i
am
very
glad
that
he
is
unlikely
to
be
a
gainer
by
any
misfortune
that
has
befallen
his
daughter
had
it
been
otherwise
i
should
have
been
inclined
to
think
that
he
had
had
some
hand
in
this
disappearance
the
lawyer
looked
at
fenton
with
a
sharp
inquisitive
glance
in
other
words
you
would
imply
that
percival
nowell
may
have
made
away
with
his
daughter
you
must
have
a
very
bad
opinion
of
human
nature
fenton
to
conceive
anything
so
horrible
my
suspicions
do
not
go
quite
so
far
as
that
said
gilbert
god
forbid
that
it
should
be
so
i
have
a
firm
belief
that
marian
holbrook
lives
but
it
is
possible
to
get
a
person
out
of
the
way
without
the
last
worst
crime
of
which
mankind
is
capable
it
would
seem
more
natural
to
suspect
the
husband
than
the
father
i
should
imagine
medler
answered
after
a
thoughtful
pause
i
can
not
see
that
the
husband
had
nothing
to
gain
by
his
disappearance
and
everything
to
lose
he
might
have
supposed
the
father
to
be
dead
and
that
he
would
step
into
the
fortune
he
might
not
know
enough
of
the
law
of
property
to
be
aware
of
the
difficulties
attending
a
succession
of
that
kind
there
is
a
most
extraordinary
ignorance
of
the
law
of
the
land
prevailing
among
englishmen
or
he
may
have
been
tired
of
his
wife
and
have
seen
his
way
to
a
more
advantageous
alliance
men
are
not
always
satisfied
with
one
wife
in
these
days
and
a
man
who
married
in
such
a
strange
underhand
manner
would
be
likely
to
have
some
hidden
motive
for
secrecy
the
suggestion
was
not
without
force
for
gilbert
fenton
his
face
grew
darker
and
he
was
some
time
before
he
replied
to
medler
remarks
that
suspicion
which
of
late
had
been
perpetually
floating
dimly
in
his
brain
that
vague
distrust
of
his
one
chosen
friend
john
saltram
flashed
upon
him
in
this
moment
with
a
new
distinctness
if
this
man
whom
he
had
so
loved
and
trusted
had
betrayed
him
had
so
utterly
falsified
his
friend
estimate
of
his
character
was
it
not
easy
enough
to
believe
him
capable
of
still
deeper
baseness
capable
of
growing
weary
of
his
stolen
wife
and
casting
her
off
by
some
foul
secret
means
in
order
to
marry
a
richer
woman
the
marriage
between
john
holbrook
and
marian
nowell
had
taken
place
several
months
before
michael
death
at
a
time
when
perhaps
adela
branston
admirer
had
begun
to
despair
of
her
release
and
then
fate
had
gone
against
him
and
branston
fortune
lay
at
his
feet
when
it
was
too
late
thus
and
thus
only
could
gilbert
fenton
account
in
any
easy
manner
for
john
saltram
avoidance
of
the
widow
a
little
more
than
a
year
ago
it
had
seemed
as
if
the
whole
plan
of
his
life
was
built
upon
a
marriage
with
this
woman
and
now
that
she
was
free
and
obviously
willing
to
make
him
the
master
of
her
fortune
he
recoiled
from
the
position
unreasonably
and
unaccountably
blind
or
indifferent
to
its
advantages
there
shall
be
an
end
of
these
shapeless
unspoken
doubts
gilbert
said
to
himself
i
will
see
john
saltram
and
there
shall
be
an
explanation
between
us
i
will
be
his
dupe
and
fool
no
longer
i
will
get
at
the
truth
somehow
gilbert
fenton
said
very
little
more
to
the
lawyer
who
seemed
by
no
means
sorry
to
get
rid
of
him
but
at
the
door
of
the
office
he
paused
you
did
not
tell
me
the
names
of
the
executors
to
jacob
nowell
will
he
said
you
did
ask
me
the
question
answered
medler
curtly
there
is
only
one
executor
myself
indeed
nowell
must
have
had
a
very
high
opinion
of
you
to
leave
you
so
much
power
i
do
know
about
power
jacob
nowell
knew
me
and
he
did
know
many
people
i
do
say
that
he
put
any
especial
confidence
in
me
for
it
was
his
habit
to
trust
no
one
his
boast
that
he
trusted
no
one
but
he
was
obliged
to
name
some
one
for
his
executor
and
he
named
me
shall
you
consider
it
your
duty
to
seek
out
or
advertise
for
percival
nowell
asked
gilbert
i
shall
be
in
no
hurry
to
do
that
in
the
absence
of
any
proof
of
his
daughter
death
my
first
duty
would
be
to
look
for
her
god
grant
you
may
be
more
fortunate
than
i
have
been
there
is
my
card
medler
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
have
a
line
immediately
at
that
address
if
you
obtain
any
tidings
of
mrs
holbrook
i
will
do
so
chapter
xxx
stricken
down
a
hansom
carried
gilbert
fenton
to
the
temple
without
loss
of
time
there
was
a
fierce
hurry
in
his
breast
a
heat
and
fever
which
he
had
scarcely
felt
since
the
beginning
of
his
troubles
for
his
lurking
suspicion
of
his
friend
had
gathered
shape
and
strength
all
at
once
and
possessed
his
mind
now
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
thought
he
ran
quickly
up
the
stairs
the
outer
and
inner
doors
of
john
chambers
were
both
ajar
gilbert
pushed
them
open
and
went
in
the
familiar
looked
just
a
little
more
dreary
than
usual
the
litter
of
books
and
papers
and
portfolio
was
transferred
to
one
of
the
and
in
its
place
on
the
table
where
his
friend
had
been
accustomed
to
write
gilbert
saw
a
cluster
of
a
jug
of
and
a
tray
with
a
basin
of
lukewarm
the
door
between
the
two
rooms
stood
half
open
and
from
the
bedchamber
within
gilbert
heard
the
heavy
painful
breathing
of
a
sleeper
he
went
to
the
door
and
looked
into
the
room
john
saltram
was
lying
asleep
in
an
uneasy
attitude
with
both
arms
thrown
over
his
head
his
face
had
a
haggard
look
that
was
made
all
the
more
ghastly
by
two
vivid
crimson
spots
upon
his
sunken
cheeks
there
were
dark
purple
rings
round
his
eyes
and
his
beard
was
of
more
than
a
week
growth
ill
gilbert
muttered
looking
aghast
at
this
dreary
picture
with
strangely
conflicting
feelings
of
pity
and
anger
in
his
breast
struck
down
at
the
very
moment
when
i
had
determined
to
know
the
truth
the
sick
man
tossed
himself
restlessly
from
side
to
side
in
his
feverish
sleep
changed
his
position
two
or
three
times
with
evident
weariness
and
pain
and
then
opened
his
eyes
and
stared
with
a
blank
unseeing
gaze
at
his
friend
that
look
without
one
ray
of
recognition
went
to
heart
somehow
o
god
how
fond
i
was
of
him
he
said
to
himself
and
if
he
has
been
a
traitor
if
he
were
to
die
like
this
before
i
have
wrung
the
truth
from
him
to
die
and
i
not
dare
to
cherish
his
memory
to
be
obliged
to
live
out
my
life
with
this
doubt
of
him
this
doubt
had
he
much
reason
to
doubt
two
minutes
afterwards
when
john
saltram
raised
himself
on
his
gaunt
arm
and
looked
piteously
round
the
room
marian
he
called
marian
yes
muttered
gilbert
it
is
all
true
he
is
calling
his
wife
the
revelation
scarcely
seemed
a
surprise
to
him
little
by
little
that
suspicion
so
vague
and
dim
at
first
had
gathered
strength
and
now
that
all
his
doubts
received
confirmation
from
those
unconscious
lips
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
had
known
his
friend
falsehood
for
a
long
time
marian
come
here
come
child
come
the
sick
man
cried
in
feeble
imploring
tones
what
are
you
afraid
of
me
is
this
death
am
i
dead
and
parted
from
her
would
anything
else
keep
her
from
me
when
i
call
for
her
the
poor
child
that
loved
me
so
well
and
i
have
wished
myself
free
of
her
god
forgive
me
wished
myself
free
the
words
were
muttered
in
broken
gasping
fragments
of
sentences
but
gilbert
heard
them
and
understood
them
very
easily
then
after
looking
about
the
room
and
looking
full
at
gilbert
without
seeing
him
john
saltram
fell
back
upon
his
tumbled
pillows
and
closed
his
eyes
gilbert
heard
a
slipshod
step
in
the
outer
room
and
turning
round
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
laundress
that
mature
and
somewhat
depressing
matron
whom
he
had
sought
out
a
little
time
before
when
he
wanted
to
discover
saltram
whereabouts
this
woman
upon
seeing
him
burst
forth
immediately
into
jubilation
o
sir
what
a
providence
it
is
that
you
come
she
cried
poor
dear
gentleman
he
has
been
that
ill
and
me
not
knowing
what
to
do
more
than
a
baby
except
in
the
way
of
sending
for
a
doctor
when
i
see
how
bad
he
was
and
waiting
on
him
myself
day
and
night
which
i
have
done
faithful
and
am
that
in
consequence
that
i
shake
like
a
haspen
and
ca
touch
a
bit
of
victuals
i
had
but
just
slipped
round
to
the
court
while
he
was
asleep
poor
dear
to
give
my
children
their
dinner
for
it
a
hard
trial
sir
having
a
helpless
young
family
depending
upon
one
and
it
would
but
be
fair
that
all
i
have
gone
through
should
be
considered
for
though
i
says
it
as
should
there
is
one
of
your
hired
nurses
would
do
more
and
i
willing
to
continue
of
it
provisoed
as
i
have
help
at
nights
and
my
trouble
considered
in
my
wages
you
need
have
no
apprehension
you
shall
be
paid
for
your
trouble
has
he
been
long
ill
well
sir
he
took
the
cold
as
were
the
beginning
of
his
illness
a
fortnight
ago
come
next
thursday
you
may
remember
perhaps
as
it
came
on
awful
wet
in
the
afternoon
last
thursday
week
and
saltram
was
out
in
the
rain
and
walked
home
in
it
not
being
able
to
get
a
cab
i
suppose
or
perhaps
not
caring
to
get
one
for
he
was
always
a
careless
gentleman
in
such
respects
and
come
in
wet
through
to
the
skin
and
instead
of
changing
his
clothes
as
a
christian
would
have
done
just
gives
himself
a
shake
like
as
he
might
have
been
a
dog
that
had
been
swimming
and
sits
down
before
the
fire
which
of
course
drawed
out
the
steam
from
his
things
and
made
it
worse
and
writes
away
for
dear
life
till
twelve
that
night
having
something
particular
to
finish
for
them
magazines
he
says
and
so
when
i
come
to
a
bit
the
last
thing
at
night
i
found
him
sitting
at
the
table
writing
and
did
take
no
more
notice
of
me
than
a
dog
which
was
his
way
though
never
meant
unkindly
quite
the
reverse
the
laundress
paused
to
draw
breath
and
to
pour
a
dose
of
medicine
from
one
of
the
bottles
on
the
table
well
sir
the
next
day
he
had
a
cold
as
you
may
suppose
and
was
low
and
but
went
on
with
his
writing
and
it
were
no
good
asking
him
not
want
money
pratt
he
said
ca
tell
how
bad
i
want
money
and
these
people
pay
me
for
my
stuff
as
fast
as
i
send
it
in
the
day
after
that
he
was
a
deal
worse
and
had
a
wandering
way
like
as
if
he
did
know
what
he
was
doing
and
sat
turning
over
his
papers
with
one
hand
and
leaning
his
head
upon
the
other
and
groaned
so
that
it
went
through
one
like
a
knife
to
hear
him
no
use
he
said
at
last
no
use
and
then
went
and
threw
hisself
down
upon
that
bed
and
has
never
got
up
since
poor
dear
gentleman
i
went
round
to
fetch
a
doctor
out
of
essex
street
finding
as
he
was
no
better
in
the
evening
and
awful
hot
and
still
more
mew
by
name
a
very
nice
gentleman
which
said
as
it
were
rheumatic
fever
and
has
been
here
twice
a
day
ever
since
has
saltram
never
been
in
his
right
senses
since
that
day
gilbert
asked
o
yes
sir
off
and
on
for
the
first
week
he
was
quite
hisself
at
times
but
for
the
last
three
days
he
has
known
any
one
and
has
talked
and
jabbered
a
deal
and
has
been
dreadful
restless
does
the
doctor
call
it
a
dangerous
case
well
sir
not
to
deceive
you
he
ast
me
if
saltram
had
any
friends
as
i
could
send
for
and
i
says
no
not
to
my
knowledge
says
mew
he
have
any
relations
or
friends
near
at
hand
they
ought
to
be
told
that
he
in
a
bad
way
and
only
this
morning
he
said
as
how
he
should
like
to
call
in
a
physician
for
the
case
was
a
bad
one
i
see
there
is
danger
evidently
gilbert
said
gravely
i
will
wait
and
hear
what
the
doctor
says
he
will
come
again
i
suppose
yes
sir
he
sure
to
come
in
the
evening
good
i
will
stay
till
the
evening
i
should
like
you
to
go
round
immediately
to
this
mew
house
and
ask
for
the
address
of
some
skilled
nurse
and
then
go
on
in
a
cab
if
necessary
and
fetch
her
i
could
do
that
sir
of
course
not
but
what
i
feel
myself
capable
of
nursing
the
poor
dear
gentleman
you
ca
nurse
him
night
and
day
my
good
woman
do
what
i
tell
you
and
bring
back
a
professional
nurse
as
soon
as
you
can
if
mew
should
be
out
his
people
are
likely
to
know
the
address
of
such
a
person
he
gave
the
woman
some
silver
and
despatched
her
and
then
being
alone
sat
down
quietly
in
the
to
think
out
the
situation
yes
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
that
piteous
appeal
to
marian
had
settled
the
question
john
saltram
the
friend
whom
he
had
loved
was
the
traitor
john
saltram
had
stolen
his
promised
wife
had
come
between
him
and
his
fair
happy
future
and
had
kept
the
secret
of
his
guilt
in
a
dastardly
spirit
that
made
the
act
fifty
times
blacker
than
it
would
have
seemed
otherwise
sitting
in
the
dreary
silence
of
that
sick
chamber
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
painful
sound
of
the
sleeper
difficult
breathing
many
things
came
back
to
his
mind
circumstances
trivial
enough
in
themselves
but
invested
with
a
grave
significance
when
contemplated
by
the
light
of
today
revelation
he
remembered
those
happy
autumn
afternoons
at
lidford
those
long
drowsy
idle
days
in
which
john
saltram
had
given
himself
up
so
entirely
to
the
pleasure
of
the
moment
with
surely
something
more
than
mere
sympathy
with
his
friend
happiness
he
remembered
that
last
long
evening
at
the
cottage
when
this
man
had
been
at
his
best
full
of
life
and
gaiety
and
then
that
sudden
departure
which
had
puzzled
him
so
much
at
the
time
and
yet
had
seemed
no
surprise
to
marian
it
had
been
the
result
of
some
resolution
perhaps
gilbert
thought
poor
wretch
he
may
have
tried
to
be
true
to
me
he
said
to
himself
with
a
sharp
bitter
pain
at
his
heart
he
had
loved
this
man
so
well
that
even
now
knowing
himself
to
have
been
betrayed
there
was
a
strange
mingling
of
pity
and
anger
in
his
mind
and
mixed
with
these
a
touch
of
contempt
he
had
believed
in
john
saltram
had
fancied
him
nobler
and
grander
than
himself
somehow
a
man
who
under
a
careless
pretence
of
being
worse
than
his
fellows
concealed
a
nature
that
was
far
above
the
common
herd
and
yet
this
man
had
proved
the
merest
caitiff
a
weak
cowardly
villain
to
take
my
hand
in
friendship
knowing
what
he
had
done
and
how
my
life
was
broken
to
pretend
sympathy
to
play
out
the
miserable
farce
to
the
very
last
great
heaven
that
the
man
i
have
honoured
could
be
capable
of
so
much
baseness
the
sleeper
moved
restlessly
the
eyes
were
opened
once
more
and
turned
upon
gilbert
not
with
the
same
utter
blankness
as
before
but
without
the
faintest
recognition
the
sick
man
saw
some
one
watching
him
and
the
figure
was
associated
with
an
unreal
presence
the
phantom
of
his
brain
which
had
been
with
him
often
in
the
day
and
night
the
man
again
he
muttered
when
will
she
come
and
then
raising
himself
upon
his
elbow
he
cried
imploringly
mother
you
fetch
her
he
was
speaking
to
his
mother
whom
he
had
loved
very
dearly
his
mother
who
had
been
dead
fifteen
years
gilbert
mind
went
back
to
that
time
in
egypt
when
he
had
lain
like
this
helpless
and
unconscious
and
this
man
had
nursed
and
watched
him
with
unwearying
tenderness
i
will
see
him
safely
through
this
he
said
to
himself
and
then
and
then
the
account
between
them
must
be
squared
somehow
gilbert
fenton
had
no
thought
of
any
direful
vengeance
he
belonged
to
an
age
in
which
injuries
are
taken
very
quietly
unless
they
are
wrongs
which
the
law
can
redress
wounds
which
can
be
healed
by
a
golden
plaster
in
the
way
of
damages
he
could
not
kill
his
friend
the
age
of
duelling
was
past
and
he
not
romantic
enough
to
be
guilty
of
such
an
anachronism
as
mortal
combat
yet
nothing
less
than
a
duel
to
the
death
could
avenge
such
a
wrong
so
friendship
was
at
an
end
between
those
two
and
that
was
all
it
was
only
the
utter
severance
of
a
tie
that
had
lasted
for
years
nothing
more
yet
to
gilbert
it
seemed
a
great
deal
his
little
world
had
crumbled
to
ashes
love
had
perished
and
now
friendship
had
died
this
sudden
bitter
death
from
which
there
was
no
possible
resurrection
in
the
midst
of
such
thoughts
as
these
he
remembered
the
sick
medicine
pratt
had
given
him
a
few
hurried
directions
before
departing
on
her
errand
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
then
went
over
to
the
table
and
prepared
the
draught
and
administered
it
with
a
firm
and
gentle
hand
who
that
john
saltram
muttered
faintly
it
seems
like
the
touch
of
a
friend
he
dropped
back
upon
the
pillow
without
waiting
for
any
reply
and
fell
into
a
string
of
low
incoherent
talk
with
closed
eyes
the
laundress
was
a
long
time
gone
and
gilbert
sat
alone
in
the
dismal
little
bedroom
where
there
had
never
been
the
smallest
attempt
at
comfort
since
john
saltram
had
occupied
it
he
sat
alone
or
with
that
awful
companionship
of
one
whose
mind
was
far
away
which
was
so
much
more
dreary
than
actual
loneliness
sat
brooding
over
the
history
of
his
friend
treachery
what
had
he
done
with
marian
was
her
disappearance
any
work
of
his
after
all
had
he
hidden
her
away
for
some
secret
reason
of
his
own
and
then
acted
out
the
play
by
pretending
to
search
for
her
knowing
him
for
the
traitor
he
was
could
gilbert
fenton
draw
any
positive
line
of
demarcation
between
the
amount
of
guilt
which
was
possible
and
that
which
was
not
possible
to
him
what
had
he
done
with
marian
how
soon
would
he
be
able
to
answer
that
question
or
would
he
ever
be
able
to
answer
it
the
thought
of
this
delay
was
torture
to
gilbert
fenton
he
had
come
here
thinking
to
make
an
end
of
all
his
doubts
to
force
an
avowal
of
the
truth
from
those
false
lips
and
behold
a
hand
stronger
than
his
held
him
back
his
interrogation
must
await
the
answer
to
that
awful
question
life
or
death
the
woman
came
in
presently
bustling
and
out
of
breath
she
had
found
a
very
trustworthy
person
recommended
by
mew
assistant
a
person
who
would
come
that
evening
without
fail
it
was
all
the
way
up
at
islington
sir
and
i
paid
the
cabman
altogether
which
he
said
it
were
his
fare
and
how
has
the
poor
dear
been
while
i
was
away
asked
pratt
with
her
head
on
one
side
and
an
air
of
extreme
solicitude
very
much
as
you
see
him
now
he
has
mentioned
a
name
once
or
twice
the
name
of
marian
have
you
ever
heard
that
i
should
say
i
have
sir
times
and
often
since
he
been
why
do
you
come
to
me
so
pitiful
and
then
lost
in
such
a
awful
wild
way
i
think
it
must
be
some
favourite
sister
sir
or
a
young
lady
as
he
has
kep
company
with
marian
cried
the
voice
from
the
bed
as
if
their
cautious
talk
had
penetrated
to
that
dim
brain
marian
o
no
no
she
is
gone
i
have
lost
her
well
i
wished
it
i
wanted
my
freedom
gilbert
started
and
stood
transfixed
looking
intently
at
the
unconscious
speaker
yes
here
was
the
clue
to
the
mystery
john
saltram
had
grown
tired
of
his
stolen
bride
had
sighed
for
his
freedom
who
should
say
that
he
had
not
taken
some
iniquitous
means
to
rid
himself
of
the
tie
that
had
grown
troublesome
to
him
gilbert
fenton
remembered
ellen
carley
suspicions
he
was
no
longer
inclined
to
despise
them
it
was
dreary
work
to
sit
by
the
bedside
watching
that
familiar
face
to
which
fever
and
delirium
had
given
a
strange
weird
look
dismal
work
to
count
the
moments
and
wonder
when
that
voice
now
so
thick
of
utterance
as
it
went
on
muttering
incoherent
sentences
and
meaningless
phrases
would
be
able
to
reply
to
those
questions
which
gilbert
fenton
was
burning
to
ask
was
it
a
guilty
conscience
the
dull
slow
agony
of
remorse
which
had
stricken
this
man
down
this
strong
man
who
was
a
stranger
to
illness
and
all
physical
suffering
was
the
body
only
crushed
by
the
burden
of
the
mind
gilbert
could
not
find
any
answer
to
these
questions
he
only
knew
that
his
sometime
friend
lay
there
helpless
unconscious
removed
beyond
his
reach
as
completely
as
if
he
had
been
lying
in
his
coffin
o
god
it
is
hard
to
bear
he
said
half
aloud
it
is
a
bitter
trial
to
bear
if
this
illness
should
end
in
death
i
may
never
know
fate
he
sat
in
the
sick
man
room
all
through
that
long
dismal
afternoon
waiting
to
see
the
doctor
and
with
the
same
hopeless
thoughts
repeating
themselves
perpetually
in
his
mind
it
was
nearly
eight
when
mew
at
last
made
his
evening
visit
he
was
a
grave
little
man
with
a
shrewd
face
and
a
pleasant
manner
a
man
who
inspired
gilbert
with
confidence
and
whose
presence
was
cheering
in
a
but
he
did
not
speak
very
hopefully
of
john
saltram
it
is
a
bad
case
sir
a
very
bad
case
he
said
gravely
after
he
had
made
his
careful
examination
of
the
patient
condition
there
has
been
a
violent
cold
caught
you
see
through
our
poor
friend
recklessness
in
neglecting
to
change
his
damp
clothes
and
rheumatic
fever
has
set
in
but
it
appears
to
me
that
there
are
other
causes
at
work
mental
disturbance
and
so
on
our
friend
has
been
taxing
his
brain
a
little
too
severely
i
gather
from
pratt
account
of
him
and
these
things
will
tell
sir
sooner
or
later
they
have
their
effect
then
you
apprehend
danger
well
yes
i
dare
not
tell
you
that
there
is
an
absence
of
danger
saltram
has
a
fine
constitution
a
noble
frame
but
the
strain
is
a
severe
one
especially
upon
the
mind
you
spoke
just
now
of
as
a
cause
for
this
mental
disturbance
might
it
not
rather
proceed
from
some
secret
trouble
of
mind
some
hidden
care
gilbert
asked
anxiously
that
sir
is
an
open
question
the
mind
is
unhinged
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
there
is
something
more
here
than
the
ordinary
delirium
we
look
for
in
fever
cases
you
have
talked
of
a
physician
mew
would
it
not
be
well
to
call
one
in
immediately
i
should
feel
more
comfortable
if
my
opinion
were
supported
sir
not
that
i
believe
there
is
anything
more
can
be
done
for
our
patient
than
i
have
been
doing
but
the
case
is
a
critical
one
and
i
should
be
glad
to
feel
myself
supported
if
you
will
give
me
the
name
and
address
of
the
gentleman
you
would
like
to
call
in
i
will
go
for
him
immediately
nay
my
dear
sir
there
is
no
occasion
for
such
haste
morning
will
do
very
well
morning
then
but
i
will
make
the
appointment
if
i
can
mew
named
a
physician
high
in
reputation
as
a
specialist
in
such
cases
as
john
saltram
and
gilbert
dashed
off
at
once
in
a
hansom
to
obtain
the
promise
of
an
early
visit
from
this
gentleman
on
the
following
morning
he
succeeded
in
his
errand
and
on
returning
to
the
temple
found
the
professional
nurse
installed
and
the
brightened
and
freshened
a
little
by
her
handiwork
the
patient
was
asleep
and
his
slumber
was
more
quiet
than
usual
gilbert
had
eaten
nothing
since
breakfast
and
it
was
now
nearly
nine
in
the
evening
but
before
going
out
to
some
neighbouring
tavern
to
snatch
a
hasty
dinner
he
stopped
to
tell
pratt
that
he
should
sleep
in
his
friend
chamber
that
night
why
you
do
mean
that
sir
sure
to
goodness
cried
the
laundress
alarmed
and
not
so
much
as
a
sofy
bedstead
nor
nothing
anyways
comfortable
i
could
sleep
upon
three
or
four
chairs
if
it
were
necessary
but
there
is
an
old
sofa
in
the
bedroom
you
might
bring
that
into
this
room
for
me
and
the
nurse
can
have
it
in
the
she
wo
want
to
be
lying
down
i
daresay
i
do
suppose
i
shall
sleep
much
myself
but
i
am
a
little
knocked
up
and
shall
be
glad
of
some
sort
of
rest
i
want
to
be
on
the
spot
come
what
may
but
sir
with
the
new
nurse
and
me
there
surely
ca
be
no
necessity
and
you
might
be
round
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
like
to
see
how
the
poor
dear
gentleman
has
slep
i
know
that
but
i
would
rather
be
on
the
spot
i
have
my
own
especial
reasons
you
can
go
home
to
your
children
thank
you
kindly
sir
which
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
take
care
of
poor
things
and
i
hope
sir
as
you
wo
forget
that
i
gone
through
a
deal
for
saltram
if
so
be
as
he
should
get
better
himself
which
the
lord
forbid
to
take
my
trouble
into
consideration
bein
as
he
were
always
a
gentleman
though
not
rich
your
services
will
not
be
forgotten
pratt
depend
upon
it
perhaps
i
better
give
you
a
couple
of
sovereigns
on
account
make
matters
straight
for
the
present
yes
sir
and
many
thanks
for
your
generosity
replied
the
laundress
agreeably
surprised
by
this
prompt
donation
and
dropping
grateful
curtseys
before
her
benefactor
and
saltram
shall
want
nothing
as
my
care
can
provide
for
him
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
is
well
and
now
i
am
going
out
to
get
some
dinner
i
shall
be
back
in
half
an
hour
the
press
and
bustle
of
the
day
work
was
over
at
the
tavern
to
which
gilbert
bent
his
steps
dinners
and
diners
seemed
to
be
done
with
for
one
more
day
and
there
were
only
a
couple
of
waiters
folding
and
putting
away
and
other
paraphernalia
in
long
narrow
closets
cut
in
the
papered
walls
and
invisible
by
day
one
of
these
functionaries
grew
brisk
again
with
a
wan
factitious
briskness
at
sight
of
gilbert
made
haste
to
redecorate
one
of
the
tables
and
in
bland
insinuating
tones
suggested
a
dinner
of
six
courses
or
so
as
likely
to
be
agreeable
to
a
lonely
and
belated
diner
well
aware
in
the
depths
of
his
inner
consciousness
that
the
six
courses
would
be
all
more
or
less
of
viands
that
had
figured
in
the
bill
of
fare
bring
me
a
chop
or
a
steak
and
a
pint
of
dry
sherry
gilbert
said
wearily
have
a
slice
of
turbot
and
sir
the
turbot
are
uncommon
fine
and
a
briled
fowl
and
mushrooms
it
will
be
ready
in
five
minutes
you
may
bring
me
the
fowl
if
you
like
i
wo
wait
for
fish
i
in
a
hurry
the
attendant
gave
a
faint
sigh
and
communicated
the
order
for
the
fowl
and
mushrooms
through
a
it
was
the
business
of
his
life
to
beguile
his
master
customers
into
themselves
and
to
set
his
face
against
chops
and
steaks
but
he
felt
that
this
particular
customer
was
proof
against
his
blandishments
he
took
gilbert
an
evening
paper
and
then
subsided
into
a
pensive
silence
until
the
fowl
appeared
in
an
agreeable
frizzling
state
fresh
from
the
gridiron
but
a
bird
of
some
experience
notwithstanding
and
wingless
it
was
a
very
hasty
meal
gilbert
was
eager
to
return
to
those
chambers
in
the
temple
eager
to
be
listening
once
more
for
some
chance
words
of
meaning
that
might
be
dropped
from
john
saltram
pale
parched
lips
in
the
midst
of
incoherent
ravings
come
what
might
he
wanted
to
be
near
at
hand
to
watch
that
with
a
closer
vigil
than
hired
nurse
ever
kept
to
be
ready
to
surprise
the
briefest
interval
of
consciousness
that
might
come
all
of
a
sudden
to
that
hapless
sinner
who
should
say
that
such
an
interval
would
not
come
or
who
could
tell
what
such
an
interval
might
reveal
gilbert
fenton
paid
for
his
dinner
left
half
his
wine
undrunk
and
hurried
away
leaving
the
waiter
with
rather
a
contemptuous
idea
of
him
though
that
individual
condescended
to
profit
by
his
sobriety
and
finished
the
dry
sherry
at
a
draught
it
was
nearly
ten
when
gilbert
returned
to
the
chambers
and
all
was
still
quiet
that
heavy
slumber
continuing
an
artificial
sleep
at
the
best
produced
by
one
of
mew
sedatives
the
sofa
had
been
wheeled
from
the
bedroom
to
the
and
placed
in
a
comfortable
corner
by
the
fire
there
were
preparations
too
for
a
cup
of
tea
to
be
made
and
consumed
at
any
hour
agreeable
to
the
watcher
a
small
teakettle
simmering
on
the
hob
a
tray
with
a
cup
and
saucer
and
queer
little
black
earthenware
teapot
on
the
table
a
teacaddy
and
other
appliances
close
at
hand
all
testifying
to
the
grateful
attention
of
the
vanished
pratt
gilbert
shared
the
nurse
watch
till
past
midnight
long
before
that
john
saltram
woke
from
his
heavy
sleep
and
there
was
more
of
that
incoherent
talk
so
painful
to
hear
talk
of
people
that
were
dead
of
scenes
that
were
far
away
even
of
those
careless
happy
wanderings
in
which
those
two
college
friends
had
been
together
and
then
mere
nonsense
talk
shreds
and
patches
of
random
thought
that
scorned
to
be
drawn
from
some
some
basket
of
the
brain
it
was
weary
work
he
woke
towards
eleven
and
a
little
after
twelve
dropped
asleep
again
but
this
time
the
effect
of
the
sedative
having
worn
off
the
sleep
was
restless
and
uneasy
then
came
a
brief
interval
of
quiet
and
in
this
gilbert
left
him
and
flung
himself
down
upon
the
sofa
to
sink
into
a
slumber
that
was
scarcely
more
peaceful
than
that
of
the
sick
man
he
was
thoroughly
worn
out
however
and
slept
for
some
hours
to
be
awakened
suddenly
at
last
by
a
shrill
cry
in
the
next
room
he
sprang
up
from
the
sofa
and
rushed
in
john
saltram
was
sitting
up
in
bed
propped
by
the
pillows
on
which
his
two
elbows
were
planted
looking
about
him
with
a
fierce
haggard
face
and
calling
for
marian
the
nurse
had
fallen
asleep
in
her
by
the
fire
and
was
slumbering
placidly
marian
he
cried
marian
why
have
you
left
me
god
knows
i
loved
you
yes
even
when
i
seemed
cold
and
neglectful
everything
was
against
me
but
i
loved
you
my
dear
i
loved
you
did
i
ever
say
that
you
came
between
me
and
fortune
was
i
mean
enough
base
enough
ever
to
say
that
it
was
a
lie
my
love
you
were
my
fortune
were
poverty
and
obscurity
hard
things
to
bear
for
you
no
my
darling
no
i
will
face
them
if
you
will
come
back
to
me
o
no
no
she
is
gone
my
life
has
gone
i
broke
her
heart
with
my
hard
bitter
words
i
drove
my
angel
away
from
me
he
had
not
spoken
so
coherently
since
gilbert
had
been
with
him
that
day
surely
this
must
be
an
interval
of
consciousness
or
gilbert
went
to
the
bedside
and
seating
himself
there
quietly
looked
intently
at
the
altered
face
which
stared
at
him
without
a
gleam
of
recognition
speak
to
me
john
saltram
he
said
you
know
me
do
you
the
man
who
was
once
your
friend
gilbert
fenton
the
other
burst
into
a
wild
bitter
laugh
gilbert
fenton
my
friend
the
man
who
trusts
me
still
poor
old
gilbert
and
i
fancied
that
i
loved
him
that
i
would
have
freely
sacrificed
my
own
happiness
for
his
and
yet
you
betrayed
him
gilbert
said
in
a
low
distinct
voice
but
that
may
be
forgiven
if
you
have
been
guilty
of
no
deeper
wrong
than
that
john
saltram
as
you
have
a
soul
to
be
saved
what
have
you
done
with
marian
with
your
wife
it
cost
him
something
even
in
that
moment
of
excitement
to
pronounce
those
two
words
killed
her
the
sick
man
answered
with
the
same
mad
laugh
she
was
too
good
for
me
you
see
and
i
grew
weary
of
her
calm
beauty
and
i
sickened
of
her
tranquil
goodness
first
i
sacrificed
honour
friendship
everything
to
win
her
and
then
i
got
tired
of
my
prize
it
is
my
nature
i
suppose
but
i
loved
her
all
the
time
she
had
twined
herself
about
my
heart
somehow
i
knew
it
when
she
was
lost
what
have
you
done
with
her
repeated
gilbert
in
a
low
stern
voice
with
his
grasp
upon
john
saltram
arm
what
have
i
done
with
her
i
forget
she
is
gone
i
wanted
my
freedom
i
felt
myself
fettered
a
ruined
man
she
is
gone
and
i
am
free
free
to
make
a
better
marriage
o
god
muttered
gilbert
is
this
man
the
blackest
villain
that
ever
cumbered
the
earth
what
am
i
to
think
what
am
i
to
believe
again
he
repeated
the
same
question
with
a
stern
kind
of
patience
as
if
he
would
give
this
guilty
wretch
the
benefit
of
every
possible
doubt
the
unwilling
pity
which
his
condition
demanded
alas
he
could
obtain
no
coherent
answer
to
his
persistent
questioning
vague
mad
reiteration
of
that
one
fact
of
his
loss
nothing
more
distinct
came
from
those
fevered
lips
nor
did
one
look
of
recognition
flash
into
those
bloodshot
eyes
the
time
at
which
this
mystery
was
to
be
solved
had
not
come
yet
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
wait
and
gilbert
waited
with
a
sublime
patience
through
all
the
alternations
of
a
long
and
wearisome
sickness
talk
of
friends
pratt
exclaimed
in
a
private
conference
with
the
nurse
never
did
i
see
such
a
friend
as
fenting
sacrificing
of
himself
as
he
do
day
and
night
to
look
after
that
poor
creature
in
there
and
taking
no
better
rest
than
he
can
get
on
that
old
horsehair
sofy
which
brickbats
or
knife
boards
is
harder
and
never
do
you
hear
him
murmur
and
yet
for
this
man
whose
battle
with
the
grim
enemy
death
he
watched
so
patiently
what
feeling
could
there
be
in
gilbert
heart
in
all
the
days
to
come
but
hatred
or
contempt
he
had
loved
him
so
well
and
trusted
him
so
completely
and
this
was
the
end
of
it
christmas
came
while
john
saltram
was
lying
at
death
door
feebly
fighting
that
awful
battle
struggling
unconsciously
with
the
bony
hand
that
was
trying
to
drag
him
across
that
fatal
threshold
just
able
to
keep
himself
on
this
side
of
that
dread
portal
beyond
which
there
lies
so
deep
a
mystery
so
profound
a
darkness
christmas
came
and
there
were
bells
ringing
and
festive
gatherings
here
and
there
about
the
great
dreary
town
and
gilbert
fenton
was
besieged
by
friendly
invitations
from
lister
remonstrating
with
him
for
his
want
of
common
affection
in
preferring
to
spend
that
season
among
his
london
friends
rather
than
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
gilbert
wrote
to
his
sister
telling
her
that
he
had
particular
business
which
detained
him
in
town
but
had
it
been
otherwise
had
he
not
been
bound
prisoner
to
john
saltram
he
would
scarcely
have
cared
to
take
his
part
in
the
conventional
feastings
and
commonplace
jovialities
of
lidford
house
had
he
not
dreamed
of
a
bright
home
which
was
to
be
his
at
this
time
a
home
beautified
by
the
presence
of
the
woman
he
loved
ah
what
delight
to
have
welcomed
the
sacred
day
in
the
holy
quiet
of
such
a
home
they
two
alone
together
with

duties
made
the
sombre
panelled
rooms
bright
with
holly
and
ivy
laurel
and
fir
and
busied
herself
briskly
in
the
confection
of
such
pies
and
puddings
as
hampshire
considered
necessary
to
the
due
honour
of
that
pious
festival
there
were
not
many
people
to
see
the
greenery
and
bright
which
embellished
the
grave
old
rooms
not
many
whom
ellen
very
much
cared
for
to
taste
the
pies
and
puddings
but
duty
must
be
done
and
the
bailiff
daughter
did
her
work
with
a
steady
industry
which
knew
no
wavering
her
life
had
been
a
hard
one
of
late
very
lonely
since
disappearance
and
haunted
with
a
presence
which
was
most
hateful
to
her
stephen
whitelaw
had
taken
to
coming
to
the
grange
much
oftener
than
of
old
there
was
seldom
an
evening
now
on
which
his
insignificant
figure
was
not
to
be
seen
planted
by
the
hearth
in
the
snug
little
smoking
his
pipe
in
that
dull
silent
way
of
his
which
was
calculated
to
aggravate
a
lively
person
like
ellen
carley
into
some
open
expression
of
disgust
or
dislike
of
late
too
his
attentions
had
been
of
a
more
pronounced
character
he
took
to
dropping
sly
hints
of
his
pretensions
and
it
was
impossible
for
ellen
any
longer
to
doubt
that
he
wanted
her
to
be
his
wife
more
than
this
there
was
a
tone
of
assurance
about
the
man
quiet
as
he
was
which
exasperated
miss
carley
beyond
all
measure
he
had
the
air
of
being
certain
of
success
and
on
more
than
one
occasion
spoke
of
the
day
when
ellen
would
be
mistress
of
wyncomb
farm
on
his
repetition
of
this
offensive
speech
one
evening
the
girl
took
him
up
sharply
not
quite
so
fast
if
you
please
whitelaw
she
said
it
takes
two
to
make
a
bargain
of
that
kind
just
the
same
as
it
takes
two
to
quarrel
there
many
curious
changes
may
come
in
a
person
life
no
doubt
and
folks
never
know
what
going
to
happen
to
them
but
whatever
changes
may
come
upon
me
is
one
of
them
i
may
live
to
see
the
inside
of
the
workhouse
perhaps
when
i
too
old
for
service
but
i
shall
never
sleep
under
the
roof
of
wyncomb
farmhouse
whitelaw
gave
a
spiteful
little
laugh
what
a
spirited
one
she
is
ai
she
now
he
said
with
a
sneer
o
you
wo
wo
you
my
lass
you
turn
up
that
pretty
little
nose
of
yours
it
do
turn
up
a
bit
of
itself
do
it
though
at
wyncomb
farm
and
stephen
whitelaw
your
father
tells
a
different
story
nell
then
my
father
tells
a
lying
story
answered
the
girl
blushing
crimson
with
indignation
and
it
is
for
want
o
knowing
the
truth
he
knows
that
if
it
was
put
upon
me
to
choose
between
your
house
and
the
union
i
go
to
the
union
and
with
a
light
heart
too
to
be
free
of
you
i
did
want
to
be
rude
whitelaw
for
you
been
enough
to
me
and
i
daresay
you
a
good
friend
to
my
father
but
i
ca
help
speaking
the
truth
and
you
brought
it
on
yourself
with
your
nonsense
she
got
a
devil
of
a
tongue
of
her
own
you
see
whitelaw
said
the
bailiff
with
a
savage
glance
at
his
daughter
but
she
do
mean
above
a
quarter
what
she
says
and
when
her
time
comes
she
do
as
she
bid
or
she
no
child
of
mine
o
i
forgive
her
replied
whitelaw
with
a
placid
air
of
superiority
i
not
the
man
to
bear
malice
against
a
pretty
woman
and
to
my
mind
a
pretty
woman
looks
all
the
prettier
when
she
in
a
passion
i
not
in
a
hurry
you
see
carley
i
can
bide
my
time
but
i
shall
never
take
a
mistress
to
wyncomb
unless
i
can
take
the
one
i
like
after
this
particular
evening
whitelaw
presence
seemed
more
than
ever
disagreeable
to
poor
ellen
he
had
the
air
of
her
fate
somehow
sitting
rooted
to
the
hearth
night
after
night
and
she
grew
to
regard
him
with
a
half
superstitious
horror
as
if
he
possessed
some
occult
power
over
her
and
could
bend
her
to
his
wishes
in
spite
of
herself
the
very
quietude
of
the
man
became
appalling
to
her
such
a
man
seemed
capable
of
accomplishing
anything
by
the
mere
force
of
persistence
by
the
negative
power
that
lay
in
his
silent
nature
i
suppose
he
means
to
sit
in
that
room
night
after
night
smoking
his
pipe
and
staring
with
those
pale
stupid
eyes
of
his
till
i
change
my
mind
and
promise
to
marry
him
ellen
said
to
herself
as
she
meditated
angrily
on
the
annoyance
of
whitelaw
courtship
he
may
sit
there
till
his
hair
turns
gray
if
ever
such
red
hair
does
turn
to
anything
better
than
itself
and
he
find
no
change
in
me
i
wish
frank
were
here
to
keep
up
my
courage
i
think
if
he
were
to
ask
me
to
run
away
with
him
i
should
be
tempted
to
say
yes
at
the
risk
of
bringing
ruin
upon
both
of
us
anything
to
escape
out
of
the
power
of
that
man
but
come
what
may
i
wo
endure
it
much
longer
i
run
away
to
service
soon
after
christmas
and
father
will
only
have
himself
to
thank
for
the
loss
of
me
it
was
whitelaw
who
appeared
as
principal
guest
at
the
grange
on
whitelaw
supported
on
this
occasion
by
a
widowed
cousin
of
his
who
had
kept
house
for
him
for
some
years
and
who
bore
a
strong
family
likeness
to
him
both
in
person
and
manner
and
ellen
carley
thought
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
world
to
contain
a
more
disagreeable
pair
these
were
the
guests
who
consumed
great
quantities
of
ellen
pies
and
puddings
and
who
sat
under
her
festal
garlands
of
holly
and
laurel
she
had
been
especially
careful
to
hang
no
scrap
of
mistletoe
which
might
have
afforded
whitelaw
an
excuse
for
a
practical
display
of
his
gallantry
a
fact
which
did
not
escape
the
playful
observation
of
his
cousin
tadman
young
ladies
do
often
forget
to
put
up
a
bit
of
mistletoe
said
this
matron
when
there
a
chance
of
them
they
like
being
by
and
she
glanced
in
a
meaning
way
from
ellen
to
the
master
of
wyncomb
farm
miss
carley
is
like
the
generality
of
young
ladies
whitelaw
answered
with
a
glum
look
and
his
kinswoman
was
fain
to
drop
the
subject
alone
with
ellen
sly
tadman
took
occasion
to
launch
out
into
enthusiastic
praises
of
her
cousin
to
which
the
girl
listened
in
profound
silence
closely
watched
all
the
time
by
the
woman
sharp
gray
eyes
and
then
by
degrees
her
tone
changed
ever
so
little
and
she
owned
that
her
kinsman
was
not
altogether
faultless
indeed
it
was
curious
to
perceive
what
numerous
shortcomings
were
coexistent
with
those
shining
merits
of
his
he
has
been
a
good
friend
to
me
continued
the
matron
that
i
never
have
denied
and
never
shall
deny
but
i
have
been
a
good
servant
to
him
ah
there
is
a
hired
servant
as
would
toil
and
drudge
and
watch
and
pinch
as
i
have
done
to
please
him
and
never
have
had
payment
from
him
more
than
a
new
gown
at
christmas
or
a
note
after
harvest
and
of
course
if
ever
he
marries
i
shall
have
to
look
for
a
new
home
for
i
know
too
much
of
his
ways
i
daresay
for
a
wife
to
like
to
have
me
about
her
and
me
of
an
age
when
it
seem
a
hard
to
have
to
go
among
strangers
and
not
having
saved
sixpence
where
i
might
have
put
by
a
hundred
pounds
easy
if
i
had
been
working
without
wages
for
a
relation
but
i
not
been
called
a
servant
you
see
and
i
suppose
stephen
thinks
that
payment
enough
for
my
trouble
goodness
knows
saved
him
many
a
pound
and
that
he
know
when
i
gone
for
he
near
is
stephen
and
it
goes
to
his
heart
to
part
with
a
shilling
but
why
should
you
ever
leave
him
mrs
tadman
ellen
asked
kindly
i
should
think
he
could
have
a
better
housekeeper
perhaps
not
answered
the
widow
shaking
her
head
with
mysterious
significance
but
his
wife
wo
think
that
and
when
he
got
a
wife
he
want
her
to
be
his
housekeeper
and
to
pinch
and
scrape
as
pinched
and
scraped
for
him
lord
help
her
concluded
tadman
with
a
faint
groan
which
was
far
from
complimentary
to
her
relative
character
but
perhaps
he
never
will
marry
argued
ellen
coolly
o
yes
he
will
miss
carley
replied
tadman
with
another
significant
movement
of
her
head
he
set
his
heart
on
that
and
he
set
his
heart
on
the
young
woman
he
means
to
marry
he
ca
marry
her
unless
she
willing
to
be
his
wife
any
how
said
ellen
reddening
a
little
o
he
find
a
way
to
make
her
consent
miss
carley
depend
upon
that
whatever
stephen
whitelaw
sets
his
mind
upon
he
do
but
i
do
envy
that
poor
young
woman
for
she
have
a
hard
life
of
it
at
wyncomb
and
a
hard
master
in
my
cousin
stephen
she
must
be
a
very
young
woman
if
she
marries
him
against
her
will
ellen
said
laughing
and
then
ran
off
to
get
the
tea
ready
leaving
tadman
to
her
meditations
which
were
not
of
a
lively
nature
at
the
best
of
times
that
came
to
an
end
at
last
after
a
long
evening
in
the
oak
parlour
enlivened
by
a
solemn
game
at
whist
and
a
ponderous
supper
of
cold
sirloin
and
mince
pies
and
looking
out
at
the
wintry
moonlight
and
the
shadowy
garden
and
flat
waste
of
from
the
narrow
casement
in
her
own
room
ellen
carley
wondered
what
those
she
loved
best
in
the
world
were
doing
and
thinking
of
under
that
moonlit
sky
where
was
marian
holbrook
that
friend
whom
she
had
loved
so
well
and
whose
fate
remained
so
profound
a
mystery
and
what
was
frank
randall
doing
far
away
in
london
where
he
had
gone
to
fill
a
responsible
position
in
a
large
city
firm
of
solicitors
and
whence
he
had
promised
to
return
faithful
to
his
first
love
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
fairly
on
the
road
to
a
competence
wherewith
to
endow
her
thus
it
was
that
poor
ellen
kept
the
close
of
her
looking
out
over
the
cold
moonlit
fields
and
wondering
how
she
was
to
escape
from
the
persecution
of
stephen
whitelaw
that
obnoxious
individual
had
invited
carley
and
his
daughter
to
spend
at
wyncomb
a
display
of
hospitality
so
foreign
to
his
character
that
it
was
scarcely
strange
that
tadman
opened
her
eyes
and
stared
aghast
as
she
heard
the
invitation
given
it
had
been
accepted
too
much
to
ellen
disgust
and
her
father
told
her
more
than
once
in
the
course
of
the
ensuing
week
that
she
was
to
put
on
her
best
gown
and
smarten
herself
up
a
bit
on
and
if
you
want
a
new
gown
nell
i
do
mind
giving
it
you
said
the
bailiff
in
a
burst
of
generosity
and
with
the
prevailing
masculine
idea
that
a
new
gown
was
a
panacea
for
all
feminine
griefs
you
can
walk
over
to
malsham
and
buy
it
any
afternoon
you
like
but
ellen
did
not
care
for
a
new
gown
and
told
her
father
so
with
a
word
or
two
of
thanks
for
his
offer
she
did
not
desire
fine
dresses
she
had
indeed
been
looking
over
and
furbishing
up
her
wardrobe
of
late
with
a
view
to
that
possible
flight
of
hers
and
it
was
to
her
cotton
working
gowns
that
she
had
paid
most
attention
looking
forward
to
begin
a
harder
life
in
some
stranger
service
ready
to
endure
anything
rather
than
to
marry
stephen
whitelaw
and
of
late
the
conviction
had
grown
upon
her
that
her
father
was
very
much
in
earnest
and
that
before
long
it
would
be
a
question
whether
she
should
obey
him
or
be
turned
out
of
doors
she
had
seen
his
dealings
with
other
people
and
she
knew
him
to
be
a
passionate
determined
man
hard
as
iron
in
his
anger
i
wo
give
him
the
trouble
to
turn
me
out
of
doors
ellen
said
to
herself
when
i
know
his
mind
and
that
there
no
hope
of
turning
him
i
get
away
quietly
and
find
some
new
home
he
has
no
real
power
over
me
and
i
have
but
to
earn
my
own
living
to
be
independent
of
him
and
i
do
suppose
frank
will
think
any
the
worse
of
me
for
having
been
a
servant
thought
the
girl
with
something
like
a
sob
it
seemed
hard
that
she
must
needs
sink
lower
in
her
lover
eyes
when
she
was
so
far
beneath
him
already
he
a
lawyer
son
a
gentleman
by
education
and
she
an
untaught
country
girl
chapter
xxxii
the
padlocked
door
at
wyncomb
the
countenance
of
the
new
year
was
harsh
rugged
and
gloomy
as
of
a
new
year
that
had
no
idea
of
making
his
wintry
aspect
pleasant
or
brightening
the
gloom
of
his
infancy
with
any
deceptive
gleams
of
january
sunshine
a
bitter
north
wind
made
a
dreary
howling
among
the
leafless
trees
and
swept
across
the
broad
bare
fields
with
merciless
force
a
bleak
cruel
on
which
to
go
out
but
it
was
more
in
harmony
with
ellen
carley
thoughts
than
brighter
weather
could
have
been
and
she
went
to
and
fro
about
her
morning
work
up
and
down
cold
windy
passages
and
in
and
out
of
the
frozen
dairy
unmoved
by
the
bitter
wind
which
swept
the
crisp
waves
of
dark
brown
hair
from
her
low
brows
and
tinged
the
tip
of
her
impertinent
little
nose
with
a
faint
wintry
bloom
the
bailiff
was
in
very
high
spirits
this
first
morning
of
the
new
year
almost
uproarious
spirits
indeed
which
vented
themselves
in
snatches
of
boisterous
song
as
he
bustled
backwards
and
forwards
from
house
to
stables
dressed
in
his
best
blue
coat
and
bright
buttons
and
a
capacious
buff
waistcoat
with
his
ponderous
nether
limbs
clothed
in
and
boots
with
vinegar
tops
looking
altogether
the
typical
british
farmer
those
riotous
bursts
of
song
made
his
daughter
shudder
somehow
his
gaiety
was
more
alarming
to
her
than
his
customary
morose
humour
it
was
all
the
more
singular
too
because
of
late
william
carley
had
been
especially
silent
and
moody
with
the
air
of
a
man
whose
mind
is
weighed
down
by
some
heavy
burden
so
gloomy
indeed
that
his
daughter
had
questioned
him
more
than
once
entreating
to
know
if
he
were
distressed
by
any
secret
trouble
anything
going
wrong
about
the
farm
and
so
on
the
girl
had
only
brought
upon
herself
harsh
angry
answers
by
these
considerate
inquiries
and
had
been
told
to
mind
her
own
business
and
not
pry
into
matters
that
in
no
way
concerned
her
but
it
does
concern
me
to
see
you
downhearted
father
she
answered
gently
does
it
really
my
girl
what
your
father
something
more
than
a
stranger
to
you
is
he
i
should
have
thought
it
seeing
how
gone
again
me
in
some
things
lately
howsomedever
when
i
want
your
help
i
shall
know
how
to
ask
for
it
and
i
hope
you
give
it
freely
i
want
fine
words
they
never
pulled
anybody
out
of
the
ditch
that
heard
tell
of
whatever
the
bailiff
trouble
had
been
it
seemed
to
be
lightened
ellen
thought
and
yet
that
unusual
noisy
gaiety
of
his
gave
her
an
uncomfortable
feeling
it
did
not
seem
natural
or
easy
her
household
work
was
done
by
noon
and
she
dressed
hurriedly
while
her
father
called
for
her
impatiently
from
below
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
wide
bare
old
staircase
and
bawling
up
to
her
that
they
should
be
late
at
wyncomb
she
looked
very
pretty
in
her
neat
merino
dress
and
plain
linen
collar
when
she
came
tripping
downstairs
at
last
flushed
with
the
hurry
of
her
toilet
and
altogether
so
bright
a
creature
that
it
seemed
a
hard
thing
she
should
not
be
setting
out
upon
some
real
pleasure
trip
instead
of
that
most
obnoxious
festival
to
which
she
was
summoned
her
father
looked
at
her
with
a
grim
kind
of
approval
you
do
well
enough
lass
he
said
but
i
should
like
you
to
have
had
something
smarter
than
that
blue
stuff
i
would
have
minded
a
couple
of
pounds
or
so
to
buy
you
a
silk
gown
but
you
be
able
to
buy
yourself
as
many
silk
gowns
as
ever
you
like
if
you
play
your
cards
well
and
do
make
a
fool
of
yourself
ellen
knew
what
he
meant
well
enough
but
did
not
care
to
take
any
notice
of
the
speech
the
time
would
soon
come
no
doubt
when
she
must
take
her
stand
in
direct
opposition
to
him
and
in
the
meanwhile
it
would
be
worse
than
foolish
to
waste
breath
in
idle
squabbling
they
were
to
drive
to
wyncomb
in
the
bailiff
gig
rather
an
obsolete
vehicle
with
a
yellow
body
a
mouldy
leather
apron
and
high
wheels
picked
out
with
red
drawn
by
a
tall
gray
horse
that
did
duty
with
the
plough
on
ordinary
occasions
stephen
whitelaw
house
was
within
an
easy
walk
of
the
grange
but
the
gig
was
a
more
dignified
mode
of
approach
than
a
walk
and
the
bailiff
insisted
on
driving
his
daughter
to
her
suitor
abode
in
that
conveyance
wyncomb
was
a
long
low
gray
stone
house
of
an
unknown
age
a
spacious
habitation
enough
with
many
rooms
and
no
less
than
three
staircases
but
possessing
no
traces
of
that
fallen
grandeur
which
pervaded
the
grange
it
had
been
nothing
better
than
a
from
time
immemorial
and
had
been
added
to
and
extended
and
altered
to
suit
the
convenience
of
successive
generations
of
farmers
it
was
a
house
at
all
times
ellen
carley
thought
but
especially
gloomy
under
that
leaden
winter
sky
a
house
which
it
would
have
been
almost
impossible
to
associate
with
pleasant
family
gatherings
or
the
joyous
voices
of
young
children
a
grim
house
that
seemed
to
freeze
the
passing
traveller
with
its
cold
blank
stare
as
if
its
gloomy
portal
had
a
voice
to
say
to
him
however
lost
you
may
be
for
lack
of
shelter
however
weary
for
want
of
rest
come
not
here
idle
fancies
perhaps
but
they
were
the
thoughts
with
which
wyncomb
farmhouse
always
inspired
ellen
carley
the
place
just
suits
its
master
hard
miserly
nature
she
said
one
would
think
it
had
been
made
on
purpose
for
him
or
perhaps
the
whitelaws
have
been
like
that
from
generation
to
generation
there
was
no
such
useless
adornment
as
a
at
wyncomb
stephen
whitelaw
cared
about
as
much
for
roses
and
lilies
as
he
cared
for
greek
poetry
or
beethoven
sonatas
at
the
back
of
the
house
there
was
a
great
patch
of
bare
shadowless
ground
devoted
to
cabbages
and
potatoes
with
a
straggling
border
of
savoury
herbs
a
patch
not
even
divided
from
the
farm
land
beyond
but
melting
imperceptibly
into
a
field
of
there
were
no
superfluous
hedges
upon
dominions
not
a
solitary
tree
to
give
shelter
to
the
tired
cattle
in
the
long
hot
summer
days
noble
old
oaks
and
patriarch
beeches
tall
sycamores
and
grand
flowering
chestnuts
had
been
stubbed
up
remorselessly
by
that
economical
agriculturist
and
he
was
now
the
proud
possessor
of
one
of
the
ugliest
and
most
profitable
farms
in
hampshire
in
front
of
the
house
the
sheep
browsed
up
to
the
parlour
windows
and
on
both
sides
of
the
leading
from
the
white
gate
that
opened
into
the
meadow
to
the
door
of
abode
no
woodbine
or
pale
monthly
roses
beautified
the
front
of
the
house
in
spring
or
summer
time
the
neglected
ivy
had
overgrown
one
end
of
the
long
stone
building
and
crept
almost
to
the
ponderous
old
chimneys
and
this
decoration
which
had
come
of
itself
was
the
only
spot
of
greenery
about
the
place
five
tall
poplars
grew
in
a
row
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
front
windows
these
strange
to
say
whitelaw
had
suffered
to
remain
they
served
to
add
a
little
extra
gloom
to
the
settled
grimness
of
the
place
and
perhaps
harmonised
with
his
tastes
within
wyncomb
farmhouse
was
no
more
attractive
than
without
the
rooms
were
low
and
dark
the
windows
made
obscure
by
means
of
heavy
woodwork
and
common
glass
let
in
what
light
they
did
admit
with
a
grudging
air
and
seemed
to
frown
upon
the
inmates
of
the
chamber
they
were
supposed
to
beautify
there
were
all
manner
of
gloomy
passages
and
unexpected
flights
of
stairs
or
so
in
queer
angles
of
the
house
and
there
was
a
prevailing
darkness
everywhere
for
the
whitelaws
of
departed
generations
objecting
to
the
window
tax
had
blocked
up
every
casement
that
it
was
possible
to
block
up
and
the
stranger
exploring
wyncomb
farmhouse
was
always
coming
upon
those
blank
plastered
windows
which
had
an
unpleasant
ghostly
aspect
and
set
him
longing
for
a
fireman
hatchet
to
hew
them
open
and
let
in
the
light
of
day
the
furniture
was
of
the
oldest
black
with
age
ponderous
queer
old
bedsteads
with
dingy
hangings
of
greenish
brown
or
yellowish
green
from
which
every
vestige
of
the
original
hue
had
faded
long
ago
clumsy
bureaus
and
stiff
chairs
with
thick
legs
and
gouty
feet
heavy
to
move
and
uncomfortable
to
sit
upon
the
house
was
clean
enough
and
the
bare
floors
of
the
numerous
which
were
only
enlivened
here
and
there
with
small
strips
or
bands
of
dutch
carpet
sent
up
a
homely
odour
of
soft
soap
for
tadman
took
a
fierce
delight
in
cleaning
and
the
solitary
household
drudge
who
toiled
under
her
orders
had
a
hard
time
of
it
there
was
a
dismal
kind
of
neatness
about
everything
and
a
bleak
empty
look
in
the
sparsely
furnished
rooms
which
wore
no
pleasant
sign
of
occupation
no
look
of
home
the
humblest
cottage
with
four
tiny
square
rooms
and
a
thatched
roof
and
just
a
patch
of
garden
with
a
sweetbrier
hedge
and
roses
growing
here
and
there
among
the
cabbages
would
have
been
a
pleasanter
habitation
than
wyncomb
ellen
carley
thought
whitelaw
exhibited
an
unwonted
liberality
upon
this
occasion
the
dinner
was
a
ponderous
banquet
and
the
dessert
a
noble
display
of
nuts
and
oranges
figs
and
almonds
and
raisins
flanked
by
two
decanters
of
port
and
sherry
and
both
the
bailiff
and
his
host
did
ample
justice
to
the
feast
it
was
a
long
dreary
afternoon
of
eating
and
drinking
and
ellen
was
not
sorry
to
get
away
from
the
prim
wainscoted
parlour
where
her
father
and
whitelaw
were
solemnly
sipping
their
wine
to
wander
over
the
house
with
tadman
it
was
about
four
when
she
slipped
quietly
out
of
the
room
at
that
lady
invitation
and
the
lobbies
and
long
passages
had
a
shadowy
look
in
the
declining
light
there
was
light
enough
for
her
to
see
the
rooms
however
for
there
were
no
rare
collections
of
old
china
no
pictures
or
adornments
of
any
kind
to
need
a
minute
inspection
it
a
fine
old
place
is
it
asked
tadman
there
not
many
farmers
can
boast
of
such
a
house
as
wyncomb
it
large
enough
ellen
answered
with
a
tone
which
implied
the
reverse
of
admiration
but
it
not
a
place
i
should
like
to
live
in
i
not
one
to
believe
in
ghosts
or
such
nonsense
but
if
i
could
have
any
such
foolish
thoughts
i
should
have
them
here
the
house
looks
as
if
it
was
haunted
somehow
tadman
laughed
a
shrill
hard
laugh
and
rubbed
her
skinny
hands
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
you
not
easy
to
please
miss
carley
she
said
most
folks
think
a
deal
of
wyncomb
for
you
see
it
only
them
that
live
in
a
house
as
can
know
how
dull
it
is
and
as
to
the
place
being
haunted
i
never
heard
tell
of
anything
of
that
kind
the
whitelaws
ai
the
kind
of
people
to
come
back
to
this
world
unless
they
come
to
fetch
their
money
and
then
they
come
fast
enough
i
warrant
i
used
to
see
a
good
deal
of
my
uncle
john
whitelaw
when
i
was
a
girl
and
never
did
a
son
take
after
his
father
closer
than
my
cousin
stephen
takes
after
him
just
the
same
saving
prudent
ways
and
just
the
same
masterful
temper
always
kept
under
in
that
quiet
way
of
his
as
ellen
carley
showed
herself
profoundly
indifferent
to
the
lights
and
shades
of
whitelaw
character
tadman
did
not
pursue
the
subject
but
with
a
gentle
sigh
led
the
way
to
another
room
and
so
on
from
room
to
room
till
they
had
explored
all
that
floor
of
the
house
there
the
attics
above
but
you
wo
care
to
see
she
said
the
shepherd
and
five
other
men
sleep
up
there
stephen
thinks
it
keeps
them
steadier
sleeping
under
the
same
roof
with
their
master
and
able
to
ring
them
up
of
a
morning
and
to
know
when
they
go
to
their
work
it
wearying
for
me
to
have
to
get
up
and
see
to
their
breakfasts
but
i
ca
trust
martha
holden
to
do
that
or
she
let
them
eat
us
out
of
house
and
home
there
no
knowing
what
men
like
that
can
eat
and
a
side
of
bacon
would
go
as
fast
as
if
you
was
to
melt
it
down
to
tallow
but
you
must
know
what
they
are
miss
carley
having
to
manage
for
your
father
yes
ellen
answered
i
used
to
hard
work
ah
murmured
the
matron
with
a
sigh
you
have
plenty
of
it
if
you
came
here
they
were
at
the
end
of
a
long
passage
by
this
time
a
passage
leading
to
the
extreme
end
of
the
house
and
forming
part
of
that
wing
which
seemed
older
than
the
rest
of
the
building
it
was
on
a
lower
level
than
the
other
part
and
they
had
descended
two
or
three
steps
at
the
entrance
to
this
passage
the
ceilings
were
lower
too
the
beams
that
supported
them
more
massive
the
windows
smaller
and
more
heavily
leaded
and
there
was
a
faint
musty
odour
as
of
a
place
that
was
kept
shut
up
and
uninhabited
there
nothing
more
to
see
here
said
tadman
quickly
i
had
better
go
back
i
do
know
what
brought
me
here
it
was
talking
i
suppose
made
me
come
without
thinking
there
nothing
to
show
you
this
way
but
there
another
room
there
ellen
said
pointing
to
a
door
just
before
them
a
heavy
door
painted
black
that
room
well
yes
it
a
kind
of
a
room
but
has
been
used
for
fifty
years
and
more
i
heard
say
stephen
keeps
seeds
there
and
it
always
locked
and
he
keeps
the
key
of
it
there
was
nothing
in
this
closed
room
to
excite
either
curiosity
or
interest
in
ellen
mind
and
she
was
turning
away
from
the
door
with
perfect
indifference
when
she
started
and
suddenly
seized
arm
hark
she
said
in
a
frightened
breathless
way
did
you
hear
that
what
child
did
you
say
there
was
no
one
in
there
no
one
lord
bless
your
heart
no
miss
carley
nor
ever
is
what
a
turn
you
did
give
me
grasping
hold
of
my
arm
like
that
i
heard
something
in
there
a
footstep
it
must
be
the
servant
what
martha
holden
i
should
like
to
see
her
venturing
into
any
room
stephen
keeps
private
to
himself
besides
that
door
kept
locked
try
it
and
satisfy
yourself
the
door
was
indeed
locked
a
door
with
a
clumsy
latch
securely
fastened
by
a
staple
and
padlock
ellen
tried
it
with
her
own
hand
is
there
no
other
door
to
the
room
she
asked
none
and
only
one
window
that
looks
into
the
and
is
almost
always
blocked
up
with
the
wood
piled
outside
it
you
must
have
heard
the
muslin
bags
of
seed
blowing
about
if
you
heard
anything
i
heard
a
footstep
said
ellen
firmly
a
human
footstep
i
told
you
the
house
was
haunted
mrs
tadman
lor
miss
carley
i
wish
you
would
say
such
things
it
enough
to
make
one
blood
turn
cold
do
come
downstairs
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
it
quite
dark
i
declare
and
you
given
me
the
shivers
with
your
queer
talk
i
sorry
for
that
but
the
noise
i
heard
must
have
been
either
real
or
ghostly
and
you
wo
believe
it
real
it
was
the
of
course
they
could
make
a
noise
like
human
footsteps
however
it
no
business
of
mine
tadman
and
i
do
want
to
frighten
you
they
went
downstairs
to
the
parlour
where
the
and
a
pair
of
candles
were
soon
brought
and
where
tadman
stirred
the
fire
into
a
blaze
with
an
indifference
to
the
consumption
of
fuel
which
made
her
kinsman
stare
even
on
that
hospitable
occasion
the
blaze
made
the
dark
wainscoted
room
cheerful
of
aspect
however
which
the
two
candles
could
not
have
done
as
their
light
was
almost
absorbed
by
the
gloomy
panelling
after
tea
there
was
whist
again
and
a
considerable
consumption
of
on
the
part
of
the
two
gentlemen
in
which
tadman
joined
modestly
with
many
protestations
and
with
the
air
of
taking
only
an
occasional
spoonful
contrived
to
empty
her
tumbler
and
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
to
take
another
by
the
bailiff
whose
joviality
on
the
occasion
was
inexhaustible
the
day
entertainment
came
to
an
end
at
last
to
ellen
inexpressible
relief
and
her
father
drove
her
home
in
the
yellow
gig
at
rather
an
alarming
pace
and
with
some
tendency
towards
heeling
over
into
a
ditch
they
got
over
the
brief
journey
safely
however
and
carley
was
still
in
high
good
humour
he
went
off
to
see
to
the
putting
up
of
his
horse
himself
telling
his
daughter
to
wait
till
he
came
back
he
had
something
particular
to
say
to
her
before
she
went
to
bed
chapter
xxxiii
what
must
be
shall
be
ellen
carley
waited
in
the
little
parlour
dimly
lighted
by
one
candle
the
fire
had
very
nearly
gone
out
and
she
had
some
difficulty
in
brightening
it
a
little
she
waited
very
patiently
wondering
what
her
father
could
have
to
say
to
her
and
not
anticipating
much
pleasure
from
the
interview
he
was
going
to
talk
about
stephen
whitelaw
and
his
hateful
money
perhaps
but
let
him
say
what
he
would
she
was
prepared
to
hold
her
own
firmly
determined
to
provoke
him
by
no
open
opposition
unless
matters
came
to
an
extremity
and
then
to
let
him
see
at
once
and
for
ever
that
her
resolution
was
fixed
and
that
it
was
useless
to
persecute
her
if
i
have
to
go
out
of
this
house
i
will
not
flinch
she
said
to
herself
she
had
some
time
to
wait
it
had
been
past
midnight
when
they
came
home
and
it
was
a
quarter
to
one
when
william
carley
came
into
the
parlour
he
was
in
an
unusually
communicative
mood
and
had
been
superintending
the
grooming
of
his
horse
and
talking
to
the
underling
who
had
waited
up
to
receive
him
he
was
a
little
unsteady
in
his
gait
as
he
came
into
the
parlour
and
ellen
knew
that
he
had
drunk
a
good
deal
at
wyncomb
it
was
no
new
thing
for
her
to
see
him
in
this
condition
unhappily
and
the
shrinking
shuddering
sensation
with
which
he
inspired
her
was
painfully
familiar
it
very
late
father
she
said
gently
as
the
bailiff
flung
himself
heavily
into
an
by
the
if
you
do
want
me
for
anything
particular
i
should
be
glad
to
go
to
bed
would
you
my
lass
he
asked
grimly
but
you
see
i
do
want
you
for
something
particular
something
uncommon
particular
so
there
no
call
for
you
to
be
in
a
hurry
sit
down
yonder
he
added
pointing
to
the
chair
opposite
his
own
i
got
something
to
say
to
you
something
serious
father
said
the
girl
looking
him
full
in
the
face
pale
to
the
lips
but
very
firm
i
do
think
you
in
a
state
to
talk
seriously
of
anything
o
you
do
do
you
miss
impudence
you
think
i
drunk
perhaps
you
find
that
drunk
or
sober
i
only
one
mind
about
you
and
that
i
mean
to
be
obeyed
sit
down
i
tell
you
i
not
in
the
humour
to
stand
any
nonsense
sit
down
ellen
obeyed
this
mandate
uttered
with
a
fierceness
unusual
even
in
carley
who
was
never
a
man
she
seated
herself
quietly
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hearth
while
her
father
took
down
his
pipe
from
the
and
slowly
filled
it
with
hands
that
trembled
a
little
over
the
accustomed
task
when
he
had
lighted
the
pipe
and
smoked
about
whiffs
with
a
great
assumption
of
coolness
he
addressed
himself
to
his
daughter
in
an
altered
and
conciliating
tone
well
nelly
he
said
you
had
a
rare
day
at
wyncomb
and
a
regular
ramble
over
the
old
house
with
steph
cousin
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
think
it
a
queer
gloomy
old
place
enough
father
i
wonder
any
one
can
live
in
it
the
dark
rooms
gave
me
the
horrors
i
used
to
think
this
house
was
dull
and
seemed
as
if
it
was
haunted
but
it
lively
and
gay
as
can
be
compared
to
wyncomb
humph
muttered
the
bailiff
you
a
fanciful
young
lady
miss
nell
and
do
know
a
fine
substantial
old
house
when
you
see
one
life
come
a
little
too
easy
to
you
perhaps
it
might
have
been
better
for
you
if
you
seen
more
of
the
rough
side
being
your
own
missus
too
soon
and
missus
of
such
a
place
as
this
has
spoiled
you
a
bit
i
tell
you
nell
there
ai
a
better
house
in
hampshire
than
wyncomb
though
it
suit
your
fanciful
notions
do
you
know
the
size
of
stephen
farm
no
father
i
never
thought
about
it
what
do
you
say
to
three
hundred
acres
over
three
hundred
nigher
to
four
perhaps
i
suppose
it
a
large
farm
father
but
i
know
nothing
about
such
things
you
suppose
it
large
and
you
know
nothing
about
such
things
cried
the
bailiff
with
an
air
of
supreme
irritation
i
do
believe
any
man
was
ever
plagued
with
such
an
aggravating
daughter
as
mine
what
do
you
say
to
being
mistress
of
such
a
place
girl
mistress
of
close
upon
four
hundred
acres
of
land
not
another
man
servant
bound
to
account
for
every
blade
of
grass
and
every
ear
of
corn
as
i
am
but
free
and
independent
mistress
of
the
place
with
the
chance
of
being
left
a
widow
by
and
by
and
having
it
all
under
your
own
thumb
what
do
you
say
to
that
only
the
same
that
i
have
always
said
father
nothing
would
ever
persuade
me
to
marry
stephen
whitelaw
i
rather
starve
and
you
shall
starve
if
you
stick
to
that
roared
william
carley
with
a
blasphemous
oath
but
you
wo
be
such
a
fool
nell
you
hear
reason
you
wo
stand
out
against
your
poor
old
father
and
against
your
own
interests
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
i
given
whitelaw
my
promise
that
you
shall
be
his
wife
between
this
and
easter
what
exclaimed
ellen
with
a
faint
cry
of
horror
you
do
mean
that
you
promised
that
father
you
ca
mean
it
i
can
and
do
mean
it
lass
then
you
made
a
promise
that
will
never
be
kept
you
might
have
known
as
much
when
you
made
it
i
sure
i
been
enough
about
stephen
whitelaw
that
was
a
girl
silly
talk
i
did
think
to
find
you
a
fool
when
i
came
to
the
point
i
let
you
have
your
say
and
looked
to
time
to
bring
you
to
reason
come
nell
you
not
going
against
your
father
are
you
i
must
father
in
this
i
rather
die
twenty
deaths
than
marry
that
man
there
nothing
i
would
rather
do
is
there
you
rather
see
your
father
in
gaol
i
suppose
if
it
came
to
that
see
you
in
gaol
cried
the
girl
aghast
for
heaven
sake
what
do
you
mean
father
what
fear
is
there
of
your
being
sent
to
prison
because
i
wo
marry
stephen
whitelaw
i
not
a
baby
she
added
with
a
hysterical
laugh
you
ca
frighten
me
like
that
no
you
a
very
wise
young
woman
i
daresay
but
you
do
know
everything
you
seen
me
downhearted
and
out
of
sorts
for
this
last
but
i
do
suppose
you
troubled
yourself
much
about
it
except
to
worry
me
with
silly
questions
sometimes
when
i
not
been
in
the
humour
to
be
talked
to
things
have
been
going
wrong
with
me
ever
since
and
i
have
sent
sir
david
sixpence
yet
for
last
year
crops
i
put
him
off
with
one
excuse
after
another
from
month
to
month
he
a
careless
master
enough
at
most
times
and
never
with
my
accounts
but
the
time
has
come
when
i
ca
put
him
off
any
longer
he
wants
money
badly
he
says
and
i
afraid
he
begins
to
suspect
something
any
way
he
talks
of
coming
here
in
a
week
or
so
to
look
into
things
for
himself
if
he
does
that
i
ruined
but
the
money
father
the
money
for
the
crops
how
has
it
gone
you
had
it
have
you
yes
the
bailiff
answered
with
a
groan
i
had
it
worse
luck
and
how
has
it
gone
what
that
to
you
what
the
good
of
my
muddling
my
brains
with
figures
it
gone
i
tell
you
you
know
i
fond
of
seeing
a
race
and
never
miss
anything
in
that
way
that
within
a
drive
of
this
place
i
used
to
be
pretty
lucky
once
upon
a
time
when
i
backed
a
horse
or
bet
against
one
but
this
year
things
have
gone
dead
against
me
and
my
bad
luck
made
me
savage
somehow
so
that
i
went
deeper
than
i
been
before
thinking
to
get
back
what
i
lost
o
father
father
how
could
you
and
with
another
man
money
do
give
me
any
of
your
preaching
the
bailiff
answered
gloomily
i
can
get
enough
of
that
at
malsham
chapel
if
i
want
it
it
in
your
power
to
pull
me
through
this
business
if
you
choose
how
can
i
do
that
father
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
will
set
me
square
i
do
say
there
been
more
taken
first
and
last
but
that
would
do
it
stephen
whitelaw
would
lend
me
the
money
give
it
me
indeed
for
it
comes
to
that
the
day
he
gets
your
consent
to
be
his
wife
and
you
sell
me
to
him
for
two
hundred
pounds
father
the
girl
asked
bitterly
i
do
want
to
go
to
gaol
and
if
you
do
get
the
money
from
stephen
what
will
happen
i
ca
tell
you
that
to
a
nicety
penal
servitude
for
life
most
likely
they
call
mine
a
bad
case
i
daresay
but
sir
david
might
be
merciful
to
you
father
you
served
him
for
along
time
what
would
he
care
for
that
i
had
his
money
and
he
not
a
man
that
can
afford
to
lose
much
no
nell
i
look
for
no
mercy
from
sir
david
those
careless
men
are
generally
the
hardest
in
such
a
business
as
this
it
a
clear
case
of
embezzlement
and
nothing
can
save
me
unless
i
can
raise
money
enough
to
satisfy
him
could
you
borrow
it
of
some
one
else
besides
stephen
whitelaw
who
else
is
there
that
would
lend
me
two
hundred
pounds
ask
yourself
that
girl
why
i
have
five
pounds
worth
of
security
to
offer
and
whitelaw
will
only
lend
the
money
upon
one
condition
no
curse
him
cried
william
carley
savagely
i
been
at
him
all
this
afternoon
when
you
and
that
woman
were
out
of
the
room
trying
to
get
it
out
of
him
as
a
loan
without
waiting
for
your
promise
but
too
cautious
for
that
day
ellen
gives
her
consent
you
shall
have
the
money
he
told
me
ca
say
anything
fairer
than
that
or
more
liberal
he
does
suspect
why
you
want
it
does
he
father
ellen
asked
with
a
painful
sense
of
shame
who
can
tell
what
he
may
suspect
he
as
deep
as
satan
said
the
bailiff
with
a
temporary
forgetfulness
of
his
desire
to
exhibit
this
intended
of
his
in
a
favourable
light
he
knows
that
i
want
the
money
very
badly
i
could
help
his
knowing
that
and
he
must
think
it
something
out
of
the
common
that
makes
me
want
two
hundred
pounds
i
daresay
he
guesses
the
truth
ellen
said
with
a
profound
sigh
it
seemed
to
her
the
bitterest
trial
of
all
that
her
should
be
known
to
stephen
whitelaw
that
hideous
prospect
of
the
dock
and
the
gaol
was
far
off
as
yet
she
had
not
even
begun
to
realise
it
but
she
did
fully
realise
the
fact
of
her
father
shame
and
the
blow
seemed
to
her
a
heavy
one
heavier
than
she
could
bear
for
some
minutes
there
was
silence
between
father
and
daughter
the
girl
sat
with
her
face
hidden
in
her
hands
the
bailiff
smoked
his
pipe
in
sullen
meditation
is
there
no
other
way
ellen
asked
at
last
in
a
plaintive
despairing
tone
no
other
way
father
none
growled
william
carley
you
need
ask
me
that
question
again
there
is
no
other
way
you
can
get
me
out
of
my
difficulties
if
you
choose
i
should
never
have
been
so
venturesome
as
i
was
if
i
made
sure
my
daughter
would
soon
be
a
rich
woman
you
can
save
me
if
you
like
or
you
can
and
let
me
go
to
prison
there
no
good
preaching
about
it
or
arguing
about
it
you
got
the
choice
and
you
must
make
it
most
young
women
in
your
place
would
think
themselves
uncommon
lucky
to
have
such
a
chance
as
you
got
instead
of
making
a
trouble
about
it
let
alone
being
able
to
get
their
father
out
of
a
scrape
but
you
your
own
mistress
and
you
must
do
as
you
please
let
me
have
time
to
think
the
girl
pleaded
piteously
let
me
have
only
a
little
time
to
think
father
and
you
do
believe
that
i
sorry
for
you
do
you
she
asked
kneeling
beside
him
and
clasping
his
unwilling
hand
o
father
i
hope
you
believe
that
i
shall
know
what
to
believe
when
i
know
what
you
going
to
do
the
bailiff
answered
moodily
and
his
daughter
knew
him
too
well
to
hope
for
any
more
gracious
speech
than
this
she
bade
him
and
went
slowly
up
to
her
own
room
to
spend
the
weary
wakeful
hours
in
a
bitter
struggle
praying
that
she
might
be
enlightened
as
to
what
she
ought
to
do
praying
that
she
might
die
rather
than
become
the
wife
of
stephen
whitelaw
when
she
and
her
father
met
at
breakfast
in
the
dull
gray
january
morning
his
aspect
was
even
darker
than
it
had
been
on
the
previous
night
but
he
did
not
ask
her
if
she
had
arrived
at
any
conclusion
he
took
his
meal
in
sullen
silence
and
left
her
without
a
word
they
met
again
a
little
before
noon
at
which
hour
it
was
habit
to
consume
a
solid
luncheon
he
took
his
seat
in
the
same
gloomy
silence
that
he
had
preserved
at
but
flung
an
open
letter
across
the
table
towards
his
daughter
am
i
to
read
this
she
asked
gently
yes
read
it
and
see
what
i
got
to
look
to
the
letter
was
from
sir
david
forster
an
angry
one
revealing
strong
suspicions
of
his
agent
dishonesty
and
announcing
that
he
should
be
at
the
grange
on
the
fifth
of
the
month
to
make
a
close
investigation
of
all
matters
connected
with
the
bailiff
administration
it
was
a
letter
that
gave
little
hope
of
mercy
and
ellen
carley
felt
that
it
was
so
she
saw
that
there
were
no
two
sides
to
the
question
she
must
save
her
father
by
the
utter
sacrifice
of
her
own
feelings
or
suffer
him
to
perish
she
sat
for
some
minutes
in
silence
with
sir
david
letter
in
her
hand
staring
blankly
at
the
lines
in
a
kind
of
stupor
while
her
father
ate
cold
and
she
wondered
how
he
could
eat
at
such
a
time
looking
up
at
her
furtively
every
now
and
then
at
last
she
laid
down
the
letter
and
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
face
a
deadly
whiteness
and
despair
had
come
over
the
bright
soubrette
beauty
and
even
william
carley
hard
nature
was
moved
a
little
by
the
altered
expression
of
his
daughter
countenance
it
must
be
as
you
wish
father
she
said
slowly
there
is
no
help
for
it
i
can
not
see
you
brought
to
disgrace
stephen
whitelaw
must
have
the
price
he
asks
for
his
money
that
a
good
lass
cried
the
bailiff
springing
up
and
clasping
his
daughter
in
his
arms
a
most
unusual
display
of
affection
on
his
part
that
bravely
spoken
nell
and
you
never
need
repent
the
choice
that
make
you
mistress
of
wyncomb
farm
with
a
good
home
to
give
your
father
in
his
old
age
the
girl
drew
herself
hastily
from
his
embrace
and
turned
away
from
him
with
a
shudder
he
was
her
father
and
there
was
something
horrible
in
the
idea
of
his
disgrace
but
there
was
very
little
affection
for
him
in
her
mind
he
was
willing
to
sell
her
into
bondage
in
order
to
save
himself
it
was
in
this
light
she
regarded
the
transaction
with
stephen
whitelaw
chapter
xxxiv
doubtful
information
the
early
days
of
the
new
year
brought
little
change
in
john
condition
mew
and
the
physician
who
saw
him
once
in
every
three
days
seemed
perhaps
a
shade
more
hopeful
than
they
had
been
but
would
express
no
decided
opinion
when
gilbert
pressed
them
with
close
questioning
the
struggle
was
still
going
on
the
issue
still
doubtful
if
we
could
keep
the
mind
at
rest
said
the
physician
we
should
have
every
chance
of
doing
better
but
this
constant
restlessness
this
of
the
brain
of
which
you
and
mew
tell
me
must
needs
make
a
perpetual
demand
upon
the
patient
physical
powers
the
waste
is
always
going
on
we
can
not
look
for
recovery
until
we
obtain
more
repose
several
weeks
had
passed
since
the
beginning
of
john
saltram
illness
and
there
were
no
tidings
from
medler
every
day
gilbert
had
expected
some
communication
from
that
practitioner
only
to
be
disappointed
he
had
called
twice
in
soho
and
on
both
occasions
had
been
received
by
a
clerk
who
told
him
that
medler
was
out
and
not
likely
to
come
home
within
any
definite
time
he
was
inclined
to
fancy
by
the
clerk
manner
on
his
second
visit
that
there
was
some
desire
to
avoid
an
interview
on
medler
part
and
this
fancy
made
him
all
the
more
anxious
to
see
that
gentleman
he
did
not
therefore
allow
much
time
to
elapse
between
this
second
visit
to
the
dingy
chambers
in
soho
and
a
third
this
time
he
was
more
fortunate
for
he
saw
the
lawyer
let
himself
in
at
the
with
his
just
as
the
cab
that
drove
him
approached
the
house
the
same
shabby
clerk
opened
the
door
to
him
i
want
to
see
your
master
he
said
decisively
making
a
move
towards
the
the
clerk
contrived
to
block
his
way
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
do
think
medler
in
but
i
go
and
see
you
need
give
yourself
the
trouble
i
saw
your
master
let
himself
in
at
this
door
a
minute
ago
i
suppose
you
were
too
busy
to
hear
him
come
in
the
clerk
coughed
a
doubtful
kind
of
cough
significant
of
perplexity
upon
my
word
sir
i
believe
he
out
but
i
see
thanks
i
rather
see
myself
if
you
please
gilbert
said
passing
the
perturbed
clerk
before
that
functionary
could
make
up
his
mind
whether
he
ought
to
intercept
him
he
opened
the
and
went
in
medler
was
sitting
at
his
desk
bending
over
some
formidable
document
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
profoundly
absorbed
by
his
occupation
with
the
air
also
gilbert
thought
of
a
man
who
has
been
what
is
vernacularly
called
on
the
listen
medler
gilbert
said
politely
your
clerk
had
such
a
conviction
of
your
being
out
that
i
had
some
difficulty
in
convincing
him
you
were
at
home
i
only
just
come
in
i
suppose
lucas
did
hear
me
i
suppose
not
i
been
here
twice
before
in
search
of
you
as
i
conclude
you
have
been
told
i
have
expected
to
hear
from
you
daily
well
yes
yes
replied
the
lawyer
in
a
meditative
way
i
am
aware
that
i
promised
to
write
under
certain
circumstances
am
i
to
conclude
then
that
you
were
silent
because
you
had
nothing
to
communicate
that
you
have
obtained
no
tidings
of
any
kind
respecting
mrs
holbrook
medler
coughed
a
cough
no
less
expressive
of
embarrassment
than
that
of
his
clerk
why
you
see
fenton
he
began
crossing
his
legs
and
rubbing
his
hands
in
a
very
deliberate
manner
when
i
made
that
promise
with
reference
to
holbrook
i
made
it
of
course
without
prejudice
to
the
interests
or
inclinations
of
my
client
i
might
be
free
to
communicate
to
you
any
information
i
received
upon
this
subject
or
i
might
find
myself
pledged
to
withhold
it
gilbert
face
flushed
with
sudden
excitement
what
he
cried
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
solved
the
mystery
of
marian
holbrook
fate
that
you
know
her
to
be
alive
safe
well
and
have
kept
back
the
knowledge
from
me
i
have
been
compelled
to
submit
to
the
wishes
of
my
client
i
will
not
say
that
i
have
not
offered
considerable
opposition
to
her
desire
upon
this
point
but
finding
her
resolution
fixed
i
was
bound
to
respect
it
she
is
safe
then
all
this
alarm
has
been
needless
you
have
seen
her
yes
fenton
i
have
seen
her
and
she
she
forbade
you
to
let
me
know
of
her
safety
she
was
willing
that
i
should
suffer
all
the
anguish
of
uncertainty
as
to
her
fate
i
could
not
have
believed
her
so
unkind
holbrook
had
especial
reasons
for
wishing
to
avoid
all
communication
with
former
acquaintances
she
explained
those
reasons
to
me
and
i
fully
concurred
in
them
she
might
have
such
reasons
with
regard
to
other
people
she
could
have
none
with
reference
to
me
pardon
me
she
mentioned
your
name
in
a
very
particular
manner
and
yet
she
has
had
good
cause
to
trust
in
my
fidelity
she
has
a
very
great
respect
and
esteem
for
you
i
am
aware
she
said
as
much
to
me
but
her
reasons
for
keeping
her
affairs
to
herself
just
now
are
quite
apart
from
her
personal
feeling
for
yourself
i
can
not
understand
this
i
am
not
to
see
her
then
i
suppose
not
to
be
told
her
address
no
i
am
strictly
forbidden
to
disclose
her
address
to
any
one
yet
you
can
positively
assure
me
that
she
is
in
safety
her
own
mistress
happy
she
is
in
perfect
safety
her
own
mistress
and
as
happy
as
it
is
possible
she
can
be
under
the
unfortunate
circumstances
of
her
married
life
she
has
left
her
husband
for
ever
i
will
venture
to
tell
you
so
much
as
that
i
am
quite
aware
of
that
fact
how
so
i
thought
holbrook
was
quite
unknown
to
you
i
have
learnt
a
good
deal
about
him
lately
indeed
exclaimed
the
lawyer
with
a
genuine
air
of
surprise
but
of
course
your
client
has
been
perfectly
frank
in
her
communications
with
you
upon
this
subject
gilbert
said
yes
i
know
that
holbrook
has
left
her
husband
but
i
did
not
for
a
moment
suppose
she
had
left
him
of
her
own
free
will
from
my
knowledge
of
her
character
and
sentiments
that
is
just
the
last
thing
i
could
have
imagined
possible
there
was
no
quarrel
between
them
indeed
she
was
expecting
his
return
with
delight
at
the
very
time
when
she
left
her
home
in
hampshire
the
thought
of
sharing
her
fortune
with
him
was
one
of
perfect
happiness
how
can
you
explain
her
abrupt
flight
from
him
in
the
face
of
this
i
am
not
free
to
explain
matters
fenton
answered
the
lawyer
you
must
be
satisfied
with
the
knowledge
that
the
lady
about
whom
you
have
been
so
anxious
is
safe
i
thank
god
for
that
gilbert
said
earnestly
but
that
knowledge
of
itself
is
not
quite
enough
i
shall
be
uneasy
so
long
as
there
is
this
secrecy
and
mystery
surrounding
her
fate
there
is
something
in
this
sudden
abandonment
of
her
husband
which
is
painfully
inexplicable
to
me
holbrook
may
have
received
some
sudden
revelation
of
her
unworthiness
you
are
aware
that
a
letter
reached
her
a
few
hours
before
she
left
hampshire
there
is
no
doubt
that
letter
influenced
her
actions
i
do
not
mind
admitting
a
fact
which
is
so
obvious
the
revelation
that
could
move
her
to
such
a
step
must
have
been
a
very
startling
one
it
was
strong
enough
to
decide
her
course
replied
the
lawyer
gravely
and
you
can
assure
me
that
she
is
in
good
hands
gilbert
asked
anxiously
i
have
every
reason
to
suppose
so
she
is
with
her
father
medler
announced
this
fact
as
if
there
were
nothing
extraordinary
in
it
gilbert
started
to
his
feet
what
he
exclaimed
she
is
with
nowell
the
father
who
neglected
her
in
her
youth
who
of
course
seeks
her
now
only
for
the
sake
of
her
fortune
and
you
call
that
being
in
good
hands
medler
for
my
own
part
i
can
not
imagine
a
more
dangerous
alliance
when
did
percival
nowell
come
to
england
a
very
short
time
ago
i
have
only
been
aware
of
his
return
within
the
last
two
or
three
weeks
his
first
step
on
arriving
in
this
country
was
to
seek
for
his
daughter
yes
when
he
knew
that
she
was
rich
no
doubt
i
do
not
think
that
he
was
influenced
by
mercenary
motives
the
lawyer
said
with
a
calm
judicial
air
of
course
as
a
man
of
the
world
i
am
not
given
to
look
at
such
matters
from
a
sentimental
point
of
view
but
i
really
believe
that
nowell
was
anxious
to
find
his
daughter
and
to
atone
in
some
measure
for
his
former
neglect
a
very
convenient
repentance
exclaimed
gilbert
with
a
short
bitter
laugh
and
his
first
act
is
to
steal
his
daughter
from
her
home
and
hide
her
from
all
her
former
friends
i
do
like
the
look
of
this
business
medler
i
tell
you
so
frankly
nowell
is
my
client
you
must
remember
fenton
i
can
not
consent
to
listen
to
any
aspersion
of
his
character
direct
or
indirect
and
you
positively
refuse
to
tell
me
where
holbrook
is
to
be
found
i
am
compelled
to
respect
her
wishes
as
well
as
those
of
her
father
she
has
been
placed
in
possession
of
her
property
i
suppose
yes
her
grandfather
will
has
been
proved
and
the
estate
now
stands
in
her
name
there
was
no
difficulty
about
that
no
reason
for
delay
will
you
tell
me
if
she
is
in
london
gilbert
asked
impatiently
pardon
me
my
dear
sir
i
am
pledged
to
say
nothing
about
holbrook
whereabouts
gilbert
gave
a
weary
sigh
well
i
suppose
it
is
useless
to
press
the
question
medler
he
said
i
can
only
repeat
that
i
do
like
the
look
of
this
business
your
client
nowell
must
have
a
very
strong
reason
for
secrecy
and
my
experience
of
life
has
shown
me
that
there
is
very
seldom
mystery
without
wrong
doing
of
some
kind
behind
it
i
thank
god
that
holbrook
is
safe
for
i
suppose
i
must
accept
your
assurance
that
she
is
so
but
until
her
position
is
relieved
from
all
this
secrecy
i
shall
not
cease
to
feel
uneasy
as
to
her
welfare
i
am
glad
however
that
the
issue
of
events
has
exonerated
her
husband
from
any
part
in
her
disappearance
he
was
glad
to
know
this
glad
to
know
that
however
base
a
traitor
to
himself
john
saltram
had
not
been
guilty
of
that
deeper
villany
which
he
had
at
times
been
led
to
suspect
gilbert
fenton
left
medler
office
a
happier
man
than
when
he
had
entered
it
and
yet
only
half
satisfied
it
was
a
great
thing
to
know
that
marian
was
safe
but
he
would
have
wished
her
in
the
keeping
of
any
one
rather
than
of
him
whom
the
world
would
have
called
her
natural
protector
nor
was
his
opinion
of
medler
by
any
means
an
exalted
one
no
assertion
of
that
gentleman
inspired
him
with
confidence
and
he
had
not
left
the
lawyer
office
long
before
he
began
to
ask
himself
whether
there
was
truth
in
any
portion
of
the
story
he
had
heard
or
whether
he
was
not
the
dupe
of
a
lie
strange
that
marian
father
should
have
returned
at
so
opportune
a
moment
still
more
strange
that
marian
should
suddenly
desert
the
husband
she
had
so
devotedly
loved
and
cast
in
her
lot
with
a
father
of
whom
she
knew
nothing
but
his
unkindness
what
if
this
man
medler
had
been
lying
to
him
from
first
to
last
and
was
plotting
to
get
old
jacob
fortune
into
his
own
hands
i
must
find
her
gilbert
said
to
himself
i
must
be
certain
that
she
is
in
safe
hands
i
shall
know
no
rest
till
i
have
found
her
harassed
and
perplexed
beyond
measure
he
walked
through
the
busy
streets
of
that
central
district
for
some
time
without
knowing
where
he
was
going
and
without
the
faintest
purpose
in
his
steps
then
the
notion
suddenly
flashed
upon
him
that
he
might
hear
something
of
percival
nowell
at
the
shop
in
queen
anne
court
supposing
the
old
business
to
be
still
carried
on
there
under
the
sway
of
tulliver
and
it
seemed
too
early
yet
for
the
probability
of
any
change
in
that
quarter
gilbert
was
in
the
strand
when
this
notion
occurred
to
him
he
turned
his
steps
immediately
and
went
back
to
and
thence
to
the
dingy
court
where
he
had
first
discovered
marian
grandfather
there
was
no
change
the
shop
looked
exactly
the
same
as
it
had
looked
in
the
lifetime
of
jacob
nowell
there
were
the
same
old
guineas
in
the
wooden
bowl
the
same
tarnished
tankards
and
teapots
on
view
behind
the
glass
the
same
obscure
hints
of
untold
riches
within
in
the
general
aspect
of
the
place
tulliver
darted
forward
from
his
usual
as
gilbert
went
in
at
the
door
o
he
exclaimed
with
undisguised
disappointment
it
you
is
it
sir
i
thought
it
was
a
customer
i
am
sorry
to
disappoint
your
expectation
of
profit
i
have
looked
in
to
ask
you
two
or
three
questions
tulliver
that
is
all
any
information
in
my
power
i
sure
i
shall
be
happy
to
afford
sir
wo
you
be
pleased
to
take
a
seat
how
long
is
it
since
you
saw
nowell
your
former
employer
son
gilbert
asked
dropping
into
the
chair
indicated
by
the
shopman
and
coming
at
once
to
the
point
tulliver
was
somewhat
startled
by
the
question
that
was
evident
though
he
was
not
a
man
who
wore
his
heart
upon
his
sleeve
how
long
is
it
since
i
seen
nowell
percival
nowell
sir
he
repeated
staring
thoughtfully
at
his
questioner
yes
you
need
not
be
afraid
to
speak
freely
to
me
i
know
nowell
is
in
london
well
sir
i
not
seen
him
often
since
his
father
death
since
his
father
death
and
according
to
medler
jacob
nowell
son
had
only
arrived
in
england
after
the
old
man
death
or
stay
the
lawyer
had
declared
that
he
had
been
only
aware
of
percival
return
within
the
last
two
or
three
weeks
that
was
a
different
thing
of
course
yet
was
it
likely
this
man
could
have
returned
and
his
lawyer
have
remained
ignorant
of
his
arrival
gilbert
did
not
allow
the
faintest
expression
of
surprise
to
appear
on
his
countenance
not
often
since
your
master
death
but
how
often
before
well
he
used
to
come
in
pretty
often
before
the
old
man
died
but
they
were
both
of
precious
close
percival
never
let
out
that
he
was
my
master
son
but
i
guessed
as
much
before
he
been
here
many
times
how
was
it
that
i
never
came
across
him
chance
i
suppose
but
he
a
deep
one
if
you
happened
to
come
in
when
he
was
here
i
daresay
he
have
contrived
to
slip
away
somehow
without
your
seeing
him
when
did
he
come
here
last
asked
gilbert
about
a
fortnight
ago
he
came
with
medler
the
lawyer
who
introduced
him
formally
as
my
master
son
and
they
took
possession
of
the
place
between
them
for
holbrook
making
an
arrangement
with
me
to
carry
on
the
business
and
making
precious
hard
terms
too
have
you
seen
holbrook
since
that
morning
when
she
left
london
for
hampshire
immediately
after
her
grandfather
death
never
set
eyes
on
her
since
then
but
she
in
london
they
told
me
living
with
her
father
she
came
up
to
claim
the
property
i
say
the
husband
must
be
rather
a
curious
party
must
he
to
stand
that
kind
of
thing
and
part
company
with
her
just
when
she
come
into
a
fortune
have
you
any
notion
where
holbrook
or
her
father
is
to
be
found
i
should
be
glad
to
make
you
a
handsome
present
if
you
could
enlighten
me
upon
that
point
i
wish
i
could
sir
no
i
have
the
least
idea
where
the
gentleman
hangs
out
oysters
ai
closer
than
that
party
i
thought
he
get
his
paw
upon
his
father
money
somehow
when
i
used
to
see
him
hanging
about
this
place
but
i
do
believe
the
old
man
ever
meant
him
to
have
a
sixpence
of
it
there
was
very
little
satisfaction
to
be
obtained
from
tulliver
and
except
as
to
the
one
fact
of
percival
nowell
return
gilbert
left
queen
anne
court
little
wiser
than
when
he
entered
it
brooding
upon
the
revelations
of
that
day
as
he
walked
slowly
westward
he
began
to
think
that
percival
and
medler
had
been
in
league
from
the
time
of
the
prodigal
son
return
and
that
his
own
exclusion
from
the
will
as
executor
and
the
substitution
of
the
lawyer
name
had
been
brought
about
for
no
honourable
purpose
what
would
a
weak
inexperienced
woman
be
between
two
such
men
or
what
power
could
marian
have
once
under
her
father
influence
to
resist
his
will
how
she
had
fallen
under
that
influence
so
completely
as
to
leave
her
husband
and
her
quiet
country
home
without
a
word
of
explanation
was
a
difficult
question
to
answer
and
gilbert
fenton
meditated
upon
it
with
a
troubled
mind
he
walked
westward
indifferent
where
he
went
in
the
perplexity
of
his
thoughts
anxious
to
walk
off
a
little
of
his
excitement
if
he
could
and
to
return
to
his
sick
charge
in
the
temple
in
a
calmer
frame
of
mind
it
was
something
gained
at
the
worst
to
be
able
to
return
to
john
saltram
bedside
freed
from
that
hideous
suspicion
which
had
tormented
him
of
late
walking
thus
he
found
himself
towards
the
close
of
the
brief
winter
day
at
the
marble
arch
he
went
through
the
gate
into
the
empty
park
and
was
crossing
the
broad
road
near
the
entrance
when
an
open
carriage
passed
close
beside
him
and
a
woman
voice
called
to
the
coachman
to
stop
the
carriage
stopped
so
abruptly
and
so
near
him
that
he
paused
and
looked
up
in
natural
wonderment
at
the
circumstance
a
lady
dressed
in
mourning
was
leaning
forward
out
of
the
carriage
looking
eagerly
after
him
a
second
glance
showed
him
that
this
lady
was
branston
how
do
you
do
fenton
she
cried
holding
out
her
little
hand
what
an
age
since
i
have
seen
you
but
you
have
not
forgotten
me
i
hope
that
is
quite
impossible
branston
if
i
had
not
been
very
much
absorbed
in
thought
just
now
i
should
have
recognised
you
sooner
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
stop
to
speak
to
me
not
at
all
i
have
something
most
particular
to
say
to
you
if
you
are
not
in
a
very
great
hurry
would
you
mind
getting
into
the
carriage
and
letting
me
drive
you
round
the
park
i
ca
keep
you
standing
in
the
road
to
talk
i
am
in
no
especial
hurry
and
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
take
a
turn
round
the
park
with
you
branston
footman
opened
the
and
gilbert
took
his
seat
opposite
the
widow
who
was
enjoying
her
afternoon
drive
alone
for
once
in
a
way
a
propitious
toothache
having
kept
pallinson
within
doors
i
have
been
expecting
to
see
you
for
ever
so
long
fenton
why
do
you
never
call
upon
me
the
pretty
little
widow
began
with
her
usual
frankness
i
have
been
so
closely
occupied
lately
and
even
if
i
had
not
been
so
i
should
have
scarcely
expected
to
find
you
in
town
at
this
unfashionable
season
i
do
care
the
least
in
the
world
for
fashion
branston
said
with
an
impatient
shrug
of
her
shoulders
that
is
only
an
excuse
of
yours
fenton
you
completely
forgot
my
existence
i
have
no
doubt
all
my
friends
desert
me
older
friends
than
you
there
is
saltram
for
instance
i
have
not
seen
him
for
o
not
for
ever
so
long
concluded
the
widow
blushing
in
the
dusk
as
she
remembered
that
visit
of
hers
to
the
temple
that
daring
step
which
ought
to
have
brought
john
saltram
so
much
nearer
to
her
but
which
had
resulted
in
nothing
but
disappointment
and
regret
bitter
regret
that
she
should
have
cast
her
womanly
pride
into
the
very
dust
at
this
man
feet
to
no
purpose
but
adela
branston
was
not
a
proud
woman
and
even
in
the
midst
of
her
regret
for
having
done
this
foolish
thing
she
was
always
ready
to
make
excuses
for
the
man
she
loved
always
in
danger
of
committing
some
new
folly
in
his
behalf
gilbert
fenton
felt
for
the
poor
foolish
little
woman
whose
fair
face
was
turned
to
him
with
such
a
pleading
look
in
the
wintry
twilight
he
knew
that
what
he
had
to
tell
her
must
needs
carry
desolation
to
her
heart
knew
that
in
the
background
of
john
saltram
life
there
lurked
even
a
deeper
cause
of
grief
for
this
gentle
impressionable
little
soul
you
will
not
wonder
that
saltram
has
not
called
upon
you
lately
when
you
know
the
truth
he
said
gravely
he
has
been
very
branston
clasped
her
hands
with
a
faint
cry
of
terror
very
ill
that
means
dangerously
ill
yes
for
some
time
he
was
in
great
danger
i
believe
that
is
past
now
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
of
his
safety
even
yet
i
can
only
hope
that
he
may
recover
hope
that
he
might
recover
yes
but
to
be
a
friend
of
his
gilbert
never
more
it
was
a
dreary
prospect
at
best
john
saltram
would
recover
to
seek
and
reclaim
his
wife
and
then
those
two
must
needs
pass
for
ever
out
of
gilbert
fenton
life
the
story
would
be
finished
and
his
own
part
of
it
bald
enough
to
be
told
on
the
at
the
end
of
the
book
branston
bore
the
shock
of
his
ill
news
better
than
gilbert
had
expected
there
is
good
material
even
in
the
weakest
of
womankind
when
the
heart
is
womanly
and
true
she
was
deeply
shocked
intensely
sorry
and
she
made
no
attempt
to
mask
her
sorrow
by
any
conventional
speech
or
pretence
whatsoever
she
made
gilbert
give
her
all
the
details
of
john
saltram
illness
and
when
he
had
told
her
all
asked
him
plainly
if
she
might
be
permitted
to
see
the
sick
man
do
let
me
see
him
if
it
is
possible
she
said
it
would
be
such
a
comfort
to
me
to
see
him
i
do
not
say
such
a
thing
is
not
possible
my
dear
branston
but
i
am
sure
it
would
be
very
foolish
o
never
mind
that
i
am
always
doing
foolish
things
it
would
only
be
one
folly
more
and
would
hardly
count
in
my
history
dear
fenton
do
let
me
see
him
i
do
think
you
quite
know
what
you
are
asking
branston
such
a
as
john
saltram
would
be
a
most
painful
scene
for
you
he
has
been
delirious
from
the
beginning
of
his
illness
and
is
so
still
he
rarely
has
an
interval
of
anything
like
consciousness
and
in
all
the
time
that
i
have
been
with
him
has
never
yet
recognised
me
indeed
there
are
moments
when
i
am
inclined
to
fear
that
his
brain
may
be
permanently
deranged
god
forbid
exclaimed
adela
in
a
voice
that
was
choked
with
tears
yes
such
a
result
as
that
would
be
indeed
a
sore
calamity
i
have
every
wish
to
set
your
mind
at
ease
believe
me
branston
but
in
john
saltram
present
state
i
am
sure
it
would
be
for
you
to
see
him
of
course
i
can
not
press
the
question
if
you
say
that
adela
answered
despondently
but
i
should
have
been
so
glad
if
you
could
have
allowed
me
to
see
him
not
that
i
pretend
to
the
smallest
right
to
do
so
but
we
were
very
good
friends
once
before
my
husband
death
he
has
changed
to
me
strangely
since
that
time
gilbert
felt
that
it
was
almost
cruel
to
keep
this
poor
little
soul
in
utter
ignorance
of
the
truth
he
did
not
consider
himself
at
liberty
to
say
much
but
some
vague
word
of
warning
might
serve
as
a
slight
check
upon
the
waste
of
feeling
which
was
going
on
in
the
widow
heart
there
may
be
a
reason
for
that
change
branston
he
said
saltram
may
have
formed
some
tie
of
a
kind
to
withdraw
him
from
all
other
friendships
some
attachment
you
mean
exclaimed
the
widow
some
other
attachment
she
added
forgetting
how
much
the
words
betrayed
do
you
think
that
fenton
do
you
think
that
john
saltram
has
some
secret
upon
his
mind
i
have
some
reason
to
suspect
as
much
from
words
that
he
has
dropped
during
his
delirium
there
was
a
look
of
unspeakable
pain
in
branston
face
which
had
grown
deadly
pale
when
gilbert
first
spoke
of
john
saltram
illness
the
pretty
childish
lips
quivered
a
little
and
her
companion
knew
that
she
was
suffering
keenly
have
you
any
idea
who
the
lady
is
she
asked
quietly
and
with
more
than
gilbert
had
expected
from
her
i
have
some
idea
it
is
no
one
whom
i
know
i
suppose
the
lady
is
quite
a
stranger
to
you
he
might
have
trusted
me
she
said
mournfully
it
would
have
been
kinder
in
him
to
have
trusted
me
yes
branston
but
saltram
has
unfortunately
made
concealment
the
policy
of
his
life
he
will
find
it
a
false
policy
sooner
or
late
it
was
very
cruel
of
him
not
to
tell
me
the
truth
he
might
have
known
that
i
should
look
kindly
upon
any
one
he
cared
for
i
may
be
a
very
foolish
woman
fenton
but
i
am
not
ungenerous
i
am
sure
of
that
gilbert
said
warmly
touched
by
her
candour
you
must
let
me
know
every
day
how
your
friend
is
going
on
fenton
adela
said
after
a
pause
i
shall
consider
it
a
very
great
favour
if
you
will
do
so
i
will
not
fail
they
had
returned
to
by
this
time
and
at
request
branston
allowed
him
to
be
set
down
near
the
arch
he
called
a
cab
and
drove
to
the
temple
while
poor
adela
went
back
to
the
splendid
gloom
of
with
all
the
fabric
of
her
future
life
shattered
until
this
hour
she
had
looked
upon
john
saltram
fidelity
to
herself
as
a
certainty
she
knew
now
that
her
hope
was
slain
all
at
once
what
a
living
thing
it
had
been
and
how
great
a
portion
of
her
own
existence
had
taken
its
colour
therefrom
it
was
fortunate
for
branston
that
pallinson
toothache
and
the
preparations
and
medicaments
supplied
to
her
by
her
son
all
declared
to
be
infallible
and
all
ending
in
ignominious
failure
occupied
that
lady
attention
at
this
period
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
thought
or
adela
pale
face
might
have
excited
more
curiosity
than
it
did
as
it
was
the
matron
contented
herself
by
making
some
rather
snappish
remarks
upon
the
folly
of
going
out
to
drive
late
on
a
january
afternoon
and
retired
to
administer
poultices
and
cataplasms
to
herself
in
the
solitude
of
her
own
apartment
soon
after
dinner
leaving
adela
branston
free
to
ponder
upon
john
saltram
cruelty
if
he
had
only
trusted
me
she
said
to
herself
more
than
once
during
those
mournful
meditations
if
he
had
only
given
me
credit
for
some
little
good
sense
and
generosity
i
should
not
feel
it
as
keenly
as
i
do
he
must
have
known
that
i
loved
him
yes
i
have
been
weak
enough
to
let
him
see
that
and
i
think
that
once
he
used
to
like
me
a
little
in
those
old
happy
days
when
he
came
so
often
to
maidenhead
yes
i
believe
he
almost
loved
me
then
and
then
the
thought
that
this
man
was
lying
desperately
ill
perhaps
in
danger
of
death
blotted
out
every
other
thought
it
was
so
bitter
to
know
him
in
peril
and
to
be
powerless
to
go
to
him
worse
than
useless
to
him
were
she
by
his
side
since
it
was
another
whose
image
haunted
his
wandering
brain
another
whose
voice
he
longed
to
hear
she
spent
a
sleepless
melancholy
night
and
had
no
rest
next
day
until
a
commissionnaire
brought
her
a
brief
note
from
gilbert
fenton
telling
her
that
if
there
were
any
change
at
all
in
the
patient
it
was
on
the
side
of
improvement
chapter
xxxv
bought
with
a
price
ellen
carley
was
not
allowed
any
time
to
take
back
the
promise
given
to
her
father
had
she
been
inclined
to
do
so
whitelaw
made
his
appearance
at
the
grange
early
in
the
evening
of
the
of
january
with
a
triumphant
simper
upon
his
insipid
countenance
which
was
inexpressibly
provoking
to
the
unhappy
girl
it
was
clear
to
her
at
first
sight
of
him
that
her
father
had
been
at
wyncomb
that
afternoon
and
her
hateful
suitor
came
secure
of
success
his
wooing
was
not
a
very
romantic
episode
in
his
commonplace
existence
he
did
not
even
attempt
to
see
ellen
alone
but
after
he
had
been
seated
for
about
in
the
nestling
close
to
the
fire
in
a
manner
he
much
affected
being
of
a
particularly
chilly
temperament
given
to
shiver
and
turn
blue
on
the
smallest
provocation
he
delivered
himself
solemnly
of
the
following
address
i
make
no
doubt
miss
carley
that
you
have
taken
notice
for
some
time
past
of
my
sentiments
towards
yourself
i
have
never
made
any
secret
of
those
sentiments
neither
have
i
talked
much
about
them
not
being
a
man
of
many
words
i
used
to
fancy
myself
the
very
reverse
of
a
marrying
man
and
i
do
say
but
what
at
this
moment
i
think
the
man
who
lives
and
dies
a
bachelor
does
the
wisest
for
his
own
comfort
and
his
own
prosperity
but
we
are
not
the
masters
of
our
feelings
miss
carley
you
have
growed
upon
me
lately
somehow
so
that
i
got
not
to
care
for
my
life
without
you
ask
tadman
if
my
appetite
has
fell
off
within
this
last
six
months
to
a
degree
that
has
frightened
her
and
a
man
of
my
regular
habits
must
be
very
far
gone
in
love
miss
carley
when
his
appetite
forsakes
him
from
the
time
i
came
to
know
you
as
a
young
woman
in
the
bloom
of
a
young
woman
beauty
i
said
to
myself
the
girl
i
marry
and
no
other
your
father
can
bear
me
out
in
that
for
i
said
the
same
to
him
and
finding
that
i
had
his
approval
i
was
satisfied
to
bide
my
time
and
wait
till
you
came
round
to
the
same
way
of
thinking
your
father
tells
me
yesterday
afternoon
and
again
this
afternoon
that
you
have
come
round
to
that
way
of
feeling
i
hope
he
has
deceived
me
miss
carley
this
was
a
very
long
speech
for
stephen
whitelaw
it
was
uttered
in
little
gasps
or
snatches
of
speech
the
speaker
stopping
at
the
end
of
every
sentence
to
take
breath
ellen
carley
sat
on
that
side
of
the
comfortable
round
table
most
remote
from
whitelaw
deadly
pale
with
her
hands
clasped
before
her
once
she
lifted
her
eyes
with
a
piteous
look
to
her
father
face
but
he
was
smoking
his
pipe
solemnly
with
his
gaze
fixed
upon
the
blazing
logs
in
the
grate
and
contrived
not
to
see
that
mute
despairing
appeal
he
had
not
looked
at
his
daughter
once
since
stephen
whitelaw
arrival
nor
had
he
made
any
attempt
to
prepare
her
for
this
visit
this
rapid
consummation
of
the
sacrifice
come
miss
carley
said
the
former
rather
impatiently
after
there
had
been
a
dead
silence
of
some
minutes
i
want
to
get
an
answer
direct
from
your
own
lips
your
father
has
been
deceiving
me
has
he
no
ellen
said
in
a
low
voice
almost
as
if
the
reply
were
dragged
from
her
by
some
physical
torture
if
my
father
has
given
you
a
promise
for
me
i
will
keep
it
but
i
do
want
to
deceive
you
on
my
part
whitelaw
she
went
on
in
a
somewhat
firmer
tone
i
will
be
your
wife
since
you
and
my
father
have
settled
that
it
must
be
so
but
i
can
promise
no
more
than
that
i
will
be
dutiful
and
submissive
to
you
as
a
wife
you
may
be
sure
only
whitelaw
smiled
a
very
significant
smile
which
implied
that
it
would
be
his
care
to
insure
his
wife
obedience
and
that
he
was
troubled
by
no
doubts
upon
that
head
the
bailiff
abruptly
at
this
juncture
lord
bless
the
girl
what
need
is
there
of
all
this
talk
about
what
she
will
be
and
what
she
wo
be
she
be
as
good
a
wife
as
any
woman
in
england
i
stake
my
life
upon
that
she
been
a
good
daughter
as
all
the
world
knows
and
a
good
daughter
is
bound
to
make
a
good
wife
say
no
more
about
it
nell
stephen
whitelaw
knows
he
make
no
bad
bargain
in
marrying
you
the
farmer
received
this
remark
with
a
loud
sniff
expressive
of
offended
dignity
very
likely
not
william
carley
he
said
but
it
is
every
man
that
can
make
your
daughter
mistress
of
such
a
place
as
wyncomb
and
such
men
as
could
do
it
would
look
for
money
with
a
wife
however
young
and
pretty
she
might
be
there
two
sides
to
a
bargain
you
see
william
and
i
should
like
things
to
be
looked
at
in
that
light
between
you
and
me
you
no
call
to
take
offence
steph
answered
the
bailiff
with
a
conciliating
grin
i
never
said
you
was
a
good
match
for
my
girl
but
a
pretty
girl
and
a
prudent
clever
housekeeper
like
nell
is
a
fortune
in
herself
to
any
man
then
the
matter
settled
i
suppose
said
whitelaw
and
the
sooner
the
wedding
comes
off
the
better
to
my
mind
if
my
wife
that
is
to
be
wants
anything
in
the
way
of
new
clothes
i
shall
be
happy
to
put
down
a
note
or
i
go
as
far
as
thirty
towards
ellen
shook
her
head
impatiently
i
want
nothing
new
she
said
i
have
as
many
things
as
i
care
to
have
nonsense
nell
cried
her
father
frowning
at
her
in
a
significant
manner
to
express
his
disapproval
of
this
folly
and
in
so
doing
looking
at
her
for
the
first
time
since
her
suitor
advent
every
young
woman
likes
new
gowns
and
of
course
you
take
steph
friendly
offer
and
thank
him
kindly
for
it
he
knows
that
i
pretty
just
now
and
wo
be
able
to
do
much
for
you
and
it
would
do
for
whitelaw
of
wyncomb
to
begin
the
world
with
a
shabby
of
course
not
replied
the
farmer
i
bring
you
the
cash
evening
nell
and
the
sooner
you
buy
your
the
better
there
nothing
to
wait
for
you
see
i
got
a
good
home
to
take
you
to
mother
tadman
will
march
of
course
between
this
and
my
i
want
her
when
i
a
wife
to
keep
house
for
me
of
course
not
said
the
bailiff
relations
are
always
dangerous
about
a
place
ready
to
make
mischief
at
every
hand
turn
o
whitelaw
you
wo
turn
her
out
surely
your
own
flesh
and
blood
and
after
so
many
years
of
service
she
told
me
how
hard
she
had
worked
for
you
ah
that
just
like
her
growled
the
farmer
i
give
her
a
comfortable
home
for
all
these
years
and
then
she
grumbles
about
the
work
she
did
grumble
said
ellen
hastily
she
only
told
me
how
faithfully
she
had
served
you
yes
that
comes
to
the
same
thing
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
liked
to
be
mistress
of
your
house
nell
without
any
one
to
interfere
with
you
tadman
is
nothing
to
me
answered
ellen
who
had
been
by
no
means
prepossessed
by
that
worthy
matron
but
i
should
like
her
to
be
unfairly
treated
on
my
account
well
we
think
about
it
nell
there
no
hurry
she
worth
her
salt
i
daresay
whitelaw
seemed
to
derive
a
kind
of
satisfaction
from
the
utterance
of
his
christian
name
which
came
as
near
the
rapture
of
a
lover
as
such
a
sluggish
nature
might
be
supposed
capable
of
to
ellen
there
was
something
hideous
in
the
sound
of
her
own
name
spoken
by
those
hateful
lips
but
he
had
a
sovereign
right
so
to
address
her
now
and
for
evermore
was
she
not
his
goods
his
chattels
bought
with
a
price
as
much
as
a
horse
at
a
fair
that
nothing
might
be
wanting
to
remind
her
of
the
sordid
bargain
whitelaw
drew
a
small
canvas
bag
from
his
pocket
presently
a
bag
which
gave
forth
that
pleasant
chinking
sound
that
is
sweet
to
the
ears
of
so
many
as
the
music
of
gold
and
handed
it
across
the
hearth
to
william
carley
i
as
good
as
my
word
you
see
he
said
with
a
complacent
air
of
patronage
there
the
favour
you
asked
me
for
i
take
your
iou
for
it
presently
if
it
all
the
same
to
you
as
a
matter
of
form
and
to
be
given
back
to
you
upon
my
the
bailiff
nodded
assent
and
dropped
the
bag
into
his
pocket
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
then
the
two
men
went
on
smoking
their
pipes
in
the
usual
stolid
way
dropping
out
a
few
words
now
and
then
by
way
of
social
converse
and
there
was
nothing
in
whitelaw
manner
to
remind
ellen
that
she
had
bound
herself
to
the
awful
apprenticeship
of
marriage
without
love
but
when
he
took
his
leave
that
night
he
approached
her
with
such
an
evident
intention
of
kissing
her
as
could
not
be
mistaken
by
the
most
inexperienced
of
maidens
poor
ellen
indulged
in
no
girlish
resistance
no
pretty
little
comedy
of
alarm
and
surprise
but
surrendered
her
pale
lips
to
the
hateful
salute
with
the
resignation
of
a
martyr
it
was
better
that
she
should
suffer
this
than
that
her
father
should
go
to
gaol
that
thought
was
never
absent
from
her
mind
nor
was
this
sacrifice
to
filial
duty
quite
free
from
the
leaven
of
selfishness
for
her
own
sake
as
much
as
for
her
father
ellen
carley
would
have
submitted
to
any
penalty
rather
than
disgrace
to
have
him
branded
as
a
thief
must
needs
be
worse
suffering
than
any
penance
she
might
endure
in
matrimony
to
lose
frank
randall
love
was
less
than
to
let
him
learn
her
father
guilt
the
daughter
of
a
thief
she
said
to
herself
how
he
would
despise
himself
for
having
ever
loved
me
if
he
knew
me
to
be
that
chapter
xxxvi
coming
round
possessed
with
a
thorough
distrust
of
medler
and
only
half
satisfied
as
to
the
fact
of
marian
safety
gilbert
fenton
lost
no
time
in
seeking
professional
aid
in
the
work
of
investigating
this
perplexing
social
mystery
he
went
once
more
to
the
metropolitan
detective
who
had
been
with
him
in
hampshire
and
whose
labours
there
had
proved
so
futile
the
task
now
to
be
performed
seemed
easy
enough
proul
proul
was
the
name
of
the
gentleman
engaged
by
gilbert
had
only
to
discover
the
whereabouts
of
percival
nowell
a
matter
of
no
great
difficulty
gilbert
imagined
since
it
was
most
likely
that
marian
father
had
frequent
personal
communication
with
the
lawyer
nor
was
it
improbable
that
he
would
have
business
with
his
agent
or
representative
tulliver
in
queen
anne
court
provided
with
these
two
addresses
gilbert
fancied
that
proul
work
must
needs
be
easy
enough
that
gentleman
however
was
not
disposed
to
make
light
of
the
duty
committed
to
him
whether
from
a
professional
habit
of
exaggerating
the
importance
of
any
mission
undertaken
by
him
or
in
perfect
singleness
of
mind
it
is
not
easy
to
say
it
a
watching
business
you
see
sir
he
told
gilbert
and
is
pretty
sure
to
be
tedious
i
may
put
a
man
to
hang
about
this
business
all
day
and
every
day
for
a
month
at
a
stretch
and
he
may
miss
his
customer
at
the
last
especially
as
you
ca
give
me
any
kind
of
description
of
the
man
you
want
surely
your
agent
could
get
some
information
out
of
medler
clerk
in
his
trade
to
do
that
kind
of
thing
is
it
well
yes
sir
i
do
deny
that
i
might
put
a
man
on
to
the
clerk
and
it
might
answer
on
the
other
hand
such
a
gentleman
clerk
would
be
likely
to
be
uncommon
well
trained
and
uncommon
little
trusted
but
we
want
to
know
so
little
gilbert
exclaimed
impatiently
only
where
this
man
lives
and
who
lives
with
him
yes
murmured
proul
rubbing
his
chin
thoughtfully
it
ai
much
as
you
say
and
it
might
be
got
out
of
the
clerk
if
the
clerk
knows
it
but
as
to
holbrook
having
got
away
from
hampshire
and
come
to
london
that
more
than
i
can
believe
i
worked
that
business
harder
and
closer
than
ever
i
worked
any
business
yet
you
told
me
to
spare
neither
money
nor
time
and
i
did
spare
either
though
it
was
more
a
question
of
time
than
money
for
my
expenses
were
light
enough
as
you
know
i
do
believe
holbrook
could
have
got
away
from
malsham
station
up
to
the
time
when
i
left
hampshire
i
pretty
certain
she
could
have
left
the
place
any
other
way
than
by
rail
i
more
than
certain
she
could
have
been
living
anywhere
in
the
neighbourhood
when
i
was
hunting
for
her
in
short
it
comes
to
this
i
stick
to
my
old
opinion
that
the
poor
lady
was
drowned
in
malsham
river
this
was
just
what
gilbert
happily
for
his
own
peace
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
he
was
ready
to
confide
in
medler
as
a
model
of
truth
and
honesty
rather
than
admit
the
possibility
of
marian
death
we
have
this
man
medler
positive
assertion
that
holbrook
is
with
her
father
you
see
proul
he
said
doubtfully
for
medler
assertion
exclaimed
the
detective
contemptuously
there
are
lawyers
in
london
who
will
assert
anything
for
a
consideration
let
him
produce
the
lady
and
if
he
does
produce
her
i
give
him
leave
to
say
that
thomas
henry
proul
is
incapable
of
his
business
or
putting
it
in
vulgar
english
that
is
a
duffer
of
course
i
shall
carry
out
any
business
you
like
to
trust
me
with
fenton
and
carry
it
out
thoroughly
i
set
a
watch
upon
offices
and
i
circumvent
him
by
means
of
his
clerk
if
i
can
but
it
my
rooted
conviction
that
holbrook
never
left
hampshire
this
was
discouraging
and
with
that
ready
power
to
adapt
itself
to
circumstances
which
is
a
distinguishing
characteristic
of
the
human
mind
gilbert
fenton
began
to
entertain
a
very
poor
opinion
of
the
worthy
proul
judgment
but
not
knowing
any
better
person
whose
aid
he
could
enlist
in
this
business
he
was
fain
to
confide
his
chances
of
success
to
that
gentleman
and
to
wait
with
all
patience
for
the
issue
of
events
much
of
this
dreary
interval
of
perpetual
doubt
and
suspense
was
spent
beside
john
saltram
sick
bed
there
were
strangely
mingled
feelings
in
the
watcher
breast
a
pitying
regret
that
struggled
continually
with
his
natural
anger
a
tender
remembrance
of
past
friendship
which
he
despised
as
a
shameful
weakness
in
his
nature
but
could
not
banish
from
his
mind
as
he
sat
in
the
stillness
of
the
watching
the
helpless
creature
who
had
once
kept
as
faithful
a
vigil
for
him
to
john
saltram
recovery
he
looked
also
as
to
his
best
chance
of
restoring
marian
to
her
natural
home
the
influence
that
he
himself
was
powerless
to
bring
to
bear
upon
percival
nowell
daughter
might
be
easily
exerted
by
her
husband
she
was
lured
away
from
him
perhaps
by
some
specious
lie
of
her
father
some
cruel
slander
of
the
husband
there
had
been
bitter
words
between
them
saltram
has
betrayed
as
much
in
his
wandering
talk
but
to
the
last
there
was
no
feeling
but
love
for
him
in
her
heart
ellen
carley
is
my
witness
for
that
nothing
less
than
some
foul
lie
could
have
tempted
her
away
from
him
in
the
meantime
pending
the
sick
man
recovery
the
grand
point
was
to
discover
the
whereabouts
of
marian
and
her
father
and
for
this
discovery
gilbert
was
compelled
to
trust
to
the
resources
of
the
accomplished
proul
so
eager
was
he
for
the
result
that
if
he
could
have
kept
a
watch
upon
medler
office
with
his
own
eyes
he
would
have
done
so
but
this
being
out
of
the
question
and
the
more
prudent
course
a
complete
avoidance
of
the
lawyer
neighbourhood
he
could
only
await
the
result
of
his
paid
agent
researches
in
the
hope
that
nowell
was
still
in
london
and
would
have
need
of
frequent
communication
with
his
late
father
solicitor
the
first
month
of
the
year
dragged
itself
slowly
to
an
end
and
the
great
city
underwent
all
those
pleasing
alternations
from
snow
to
mud
from
the
slipperiness
of
a
city
paved
with
to
the
sloppiness
of
a
metropolis
in
a
rich
brown
compound
of
about
the
consistency
and
colour
of
soup
which
are
common
to
great
cities
at
this
season
and
still
john
saltram
lingered
on
in
the
shabby
solitude
of
his
temple
chambers
slowly
mending
mew
declared
towards
the
end
of
the
month
and
in
a
fair
way
towards
recovery
the
time
came
at
last
when
the
fevered
mind
began
to
cease
from
its
perpetual
wanderings
when
the
weary
brain
sorely
enfeebled
by
its
long
interval
of
unnatural
activity
dropped
suddenly
into
a
state
of
calm
that
was
akin
to
apathy
the
change
came
with
an
almost
alarming
suddenness
it
was
at
the
beginning
of
february
close
upon
the
dead
small
hours
of
a
bleak
windy
night
and
gilbert
was
keeping
watch
alone
in
the
while
the
professional
nurse
slept
comfortably
on
the
sofa
in
the
it
was
his
habit
now
to
spend
the
early
part
of
the
night
in
such
duty
as
this
and
to
go
home
to
bed
between
four
and
five
in
the
morning
at
which
time
the
nurse
was
ready
to
relieve
guard
he
had
been
listening
to
the
dismal
howling
of
the
winds
threatening
damage
to
neighbouring
of
rickety
constitution
and
thinking
idly
of
the
men
that
had
come
and
gone
amidst
those
old
buildings
and
how
few
amongst
them
all
had
left
any
mark
behind
them
inclined
to
speculate
too
how
many
of
them
had
been
men
capable
of
better
work
than
they
had
done
only
carelessly
indifferent
to
the
doing
of
it
like
him
who
lay
on
that
bed
yonder
with
one
muscular
arm
powerful
even
in
its
wasted
condition
thrown
wearily
above
his
head
and
an
undefinable
look
that
seemed
half
pain
half
fatigue
upon
his
haggard
face
suddenly
while
gilbert
fenton
was
meditating
in
this
idle
desultory
manner
the
sleeper
awakened
looked
full
at
him
and
called
him
by
his
name
gilbert
he
said
very
quietly
is
it
really
you
it
was
the
first
time
in
all
his
long
watches
by
that
bed
that
john
saltram
had
recognised
him
the
sick
man
had
talked
of
him
often
in
his
delirium
but
never
before
had
he
looked
his
former
friend
in
the
face
with
one
ray
of
recognition
in
his
own
an
indescribable
thrill
of
pain
went
through
gilbert
heart
at
the
sound
of
that
calm
utterance
of
his
name
how
sweet
it
would
have
been
to
him
what
a
natural
thing
it
would
have
seemed
to
have
fallen
upon
his
old
friend
breast
and
wept
aloud
in
the
deep
joy
of
this
recovery
but
they
were
friends
no
longer
he
had
to
remember
how
base
a
traitor
this
man
had
been
to
him
yes
john
it
is
i
and
you
have
been
here
for
a
long
time
o
god
how
many
months
have
i
been
lying
here
the
time
seems
endless
and
there
have
been
so
many
people
round
me
a
crowd
of
strange
faces
all
enemies
all
against
me
and
people
in
the
next
room
that
was
the
worst
of
all
i
have
never
seen
them
but
i
have
always
known
that
they
were
there
they
could
not
deceive
me
as
to
that
hiding
behind
that
door
and
watching
me
as
i
lay
here
you
might
have
turned
them
out
gilbert
he
added
peevishly
it
seems
a
hard
thing
that
you
could
let
them
stay
there
to
torment
me
there
has
been
no
one
in
either
of
the
rooms
john
no
one
but
myself
and
the
hired
nurse
the
doctors
and
pratt
now
and
then
these
people
have
no
existence
out
of
your
sick
fancy
you
have
been
very
ill
delirious
for
a
long
time
i
thank
god
that
your
reason
has
been
restored
to
you
yes
i
thank
god
with
all
my
heart
for
that
have
i
been
mad
the
other
asked
your
mind
has
wandered
but
that
has
passed
at
last
with
the
fever
as
the
doctors
hoped
it
might
you
are
calm
now
and
must
try
to
keep
yourself
quiet
there
must
be
no
more
talk
between
us
the
sick
man
took
no
notice
of
this
injunction
but
for
the
time
was
not
disobedient
and
lay
for
some
minutes
staring
at
the
watcher
face
with
a
strange
smile
upon
his
own
gilbert
he
said
at
last
what
have
they
done
with
my
wife
why
has
she
been
kept
away
from
me
your
wife
marian
yes
marian
you
know
her
name
surely
did
she
know
that
i
was
ill
and
yet
stayed
away
from
me
was
her
place
here
john
saltram
that
poor
girl
whom
you
married
under
a
false
name
whom
you
tried
to
hide
from
all
the
world
have
you
ever
brought
her
here
have
you
ever
given
her
a
wife
license
or
a
place
how
many
lies
have
you
not
told
to
hide
that
which
any
honest
man
would
have
been
proud
to
confess
to
all
the
world
yes
i
have
lied
to
you
about
her
i
have
hidden
my
treasure
but
it
was
for
your
sake
gilbert
it
was
for
the
sake
of
our
old
friendship
i
could
not
bear
to
lose
you
i
could
not
bear
to
stand
revealed
before
you
as
the
weak
wretch
who
betrayed
your
trust
and
stole
your
promised
wife
yes
gilbert
i
have
been
guilty
beyond
all
measure
i
have
looked
you
in
the
face
and
told
you
lies
i
wanted
to
keep
you
for
my
friend
i
could
not
stand
the
thought
of
a
breach
between
us
gilbert
old
friend
have
pity
on
me
i
was
weak
wicked
if
you
like
but
i
loved
you
very
dearly
he
stretched
out
his
bony
hand
with
an
appealing
gesture
but
it
was
not
taken
gilbert
sat
with
his
head
turned
away
his
face
hidden
from
the
sick
man
anything
would
have
been
better
than
the
course
you
chose
he
said
at
last
in
a
very
quiet
voice
if
she
loved
you
better
than
me
than
me
who
would
have
thought
it
so
small
a
thing
to
lay
down
my
life
for
her
happiness
or
to
stand
aloof
and
keep
the
secret
of
my
broken
heart
while
i
blest
her
as
the
cherished
wife
of
another
if
you
had
certain
reason
to
be
sure
she
loved
you
you
should
have
asserted
your
right
to
claim
her
love
like
a
man
and
should
have
been
prompt
to
tell
me
the
bitter
truth
i
am
a
man
and
would
have
borne
the
blow
as
a
man
should
bear
it
but
to
sneak
into
my
place
behind
my
back
to
steal
her
away
from
me
to
marry
her
under
a
false
name
a
step
that
might
go
far
to
invalidate
the
marriage
by
the
way
and
then
leave
me
to
the
broken
story
syllable
by
syllable
to
suffer
all
the
torture
of
a
prolonged
suspense
all
the
wasted
passion
of
anger
and
revenge
against
an
imaginary
enemy
to
find
at
last
that
the
man
i
had
loved
and
trusted
honoured
and
admired
beyond
all
other
men
throughout
the
best
years
of
my
life
was
the
man
who
had
struck
this
secret
blow
it
was
the
conduct
of
a
villain
and
a
coward
john
saltram
i
have
no
words
to
speak
my
contempt
for
so
base
a
betrayal
and
when
i
remember
your
pretended
sympathy
your
friendly
counsel
o
god
it
was
the
work
of
a
social
judas
nothing
was
wanted
but
the
kiss
yes
the
other
answered
with
a
faint
bitter
laugh
it
was
very
bad
once
having
begun
you
see
it
was
but
to
add
one
lie
to
another
anything
seemed
better
than
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
fancied
your
devotion
for
marian
would
wear
itself
out
much
sooner
than
it
did
that
you
would
marry
some
one
else
and
then
i
thought
when
you
were
happy
and
had
forgotten
that
old
fancy
i
would
have
confessed
the
truth
and
told
you
it
was
your
friend
who
was
your
rival
it
might
have
seemed
easy
to
you
to
forgive
me
under
those
happier
circumstances
and
so
our
old
friendship
might
never
have
been
broken
i
waited
for
that
gilbert
do
suppose
that
it
was
not
painful
to
me
to
act
so
base
a
part
suppose
that
i
did
not
suffer
i
did
in
a
hundred
ways
you
have
seen
the
traces
of
that
slow
torture
in
my
face
in
every
way
i
had
sinned
from
my
weak
desire
to
win
my
love
and
yet
keep
my
friend
and
god
knows
the
burden
of
my
sin
has
been
heavy
upon
me
i
will
tell
you
some
day
if
ever
i
am
strong
enough
for
so
many
words
and
if
you
will
hear
me
out
patiently
the
whole
story
of
my
temptation
how
i
struggled
against
it
and
only
gave
way
at
last
when
life
seemed
insupportable
to
me
without
the
woman
i
loved
after
this
he
lay
quiet
again
for
some
minutes
exhausted
by
having
spoken
so
long
all
the
factitious
strength
which
had
made
him
loud
and
violent
in
his
delirium
was
gone
he
seemed
as
weak
as
a
sick
child
where
is
she
he
asked
at
last
why
does
she
come
to
me
you
have
not
answered
that
question
i
have
told
you
that
her
place
is
not
here
gilbert
replied
evasively
you
have
no
right
to
expect
her
here
never
having
given
her
the
right
to
come
no
it
is
my
own
fault
she
is
in
hampshire
still
i
suppose
poor
girl
i
would
give
the
world
to
see
her
dear
face
looking
down
at
me
i
must
get
well
and
go
back
to
her
when
shall
i
be
strong
enough
to
travel
or
if
not
the
next
day
surely
the
next
day
eh
gilbert
he
raised
himself
in
the
bed
in
order
to
read
the
answer
in
face
but
fell
back
upon
the
pillows
instantly
exhausted
by
the
effort
memory
had
only
returned
to
him
in
part
it
was
clear
that
he
had
forgotten
the
fact
of
marian
disappearance
a
fact
of
which
he
had
seemed
long
ago
in
his
delirium
how
did
you
find
out
that
marian
was
my
wife
he
asked
presently
with
perfect
calmness
who
betrayed
my
secret
your
own
lips
in
your
delirious
talk
of
her
which
has
been
incessant
and
if
collateral
evidence
were
needed
to
confirm
your
words
this
which
i
found
the
other
day
marking
a
place
in
your
shakespeare
gilbert
took
a
scrap
of
ribbon
from
his
breast
a
ribbon
with
a
blue
ground
and
a
rosebud
on
it
a
ribbon
which
he
had
chosen
himself
for
marian
in
the
brief
happy
days
of
their
engagement
john
saltram
contemplated
the
scrap
of
colour
with
a
smile
that
was
half
sombre
half
ironical
yes
it
was
hers
he
said
she
wore
it
round
that
slim
swan
throat
of
hers
and
one
morning
when
i
was
leaving
her
in
a
particularly
weak
frame
of
mind
i
took
it
from
her
neck
and
brought
it
away
in
my
bosom
for
the
sake
of
having
something
about
me
that
she
had
worn
and
then
i
put
it
in
the
book
you
see
and
forgot
all
about
it
a
fitting
emblem
of
my
love
full
of
passion
and
fervour
at
the
point
of
death
there
have
been
times
when
i
would
have
given
the
world
to
undo
what
i
had
done
when
my
life
seemed
blighted
by
this
foolish
marriage
and
again
happier
moments
when
my
wife
was
all
the
universe
to
me
and
i
had
not
a
thought
or
a
dream
beyond
her
god
bless
her
you
will
let
me
go
to
her
gilbert
the
instant
i
am
able
to
travel
as
soon
as
i
can
drag
myself
anyhow
from
this
bed
to
the
railway
you
will
not
stand
between
me
and
my
love
no
john
saltram
god
knows
i
have
never
thought
of
that
and
you
knew
i
was
a
traitor
you
knew
it
was
my
work
that
had
destroyed
your
scheme
of
happiness
and
yet
have
been
beside
me
watching
me
patiently
through
this
wretched
illness
that
was
a
small
thing
to
do
you
did
as
much
and
a
great
deal
more
for
me
when
i
was
ill
in
egypt
it
was
a
mere
act
of
duty
not
of
friendship
it
was
christian
charity
eh
gilbert
if
thine
enemy
hunger
feed
him
if
he
thirst
give
him
drink
and
so
on
it
was
not
the
act
of
a
friend
no
john
saltram
between
you
and
me
there
can
never
again
be
any
such
word
as
friendship
what
little
i
have
done
for
you
i
think
i
would
have
done
for
a
stranger
had
i
found
a
stranger
as
helpless
and
unfriended
as
i
found
you
i
am
quite
sure
that
to
have
done
less
would
have
been
to
neglect
a
sacred
duty
there
is
no
question
of
obligation
till
you
are
on
your
feet
again
a
strong
man
i
will
stand
by
you
when
that
time
comes
we
part
for
ever
john
saltram
sank
back
upon
his
pillow
with
a
heavy
sigh
but
uttered
no
protest
against
this
sentence
and
this
was
all
that
came
of
vengeful
passion
against
the
man
who
had
wronged
him
this
was
the
end
of
a
anger
a
lame
and
impotent
conclusion
perhaps
but
surely
the
only
end
possible
under
the
circumstances
he
could
not
wage
war
against
a
feeble
creature
whose
hold
on
life
was
still
an
uncertainty
he
could
not
forget
his
promise
to
marian
that
no
harm
should
come
to
her
husband
through
any
act
of
his
so
he
sat
quietly
by
the
bedside
of
his
prostrate
foe
watched
him
silently
as
he
fell
into
a
brief
restless
slumber
and
administered
his
medicine
when
he
woke
with
a
hand
that
was
as
gentle
as
a
woman
between
four
and
five
the
nurse
came
in
from
the
next
room
to
take
her
place
refreshed
by
a
sleep
of
several
hours
and
then
gilbert
departed
in
the
chill
gloom
of
the
winter
morning
still
as
dark
as
night
departed
with
his
mind
lightened
of
a
great
load
for
it
had
been
very
terrible
to
him
to
think
that
the
man
who
had
once
been
his
friend
might
go
down
to
the
grave
without
an
interval
of
reason
chapter
xxxvii
a
full
confession
gilbert
did
not
go
to
the
temple
again
till
he
had
finished
his
work
at
helen
and
had
eaten
his
modest
dinner
at
a
tavern
in
he
found
that
mew
had
already
paid
his
second
visit
to
the
and
had
pronounced
himself
much
relieved
and
delighted
by
the
favourable
change
i
have
no
fear
now
he
had
said
to
the
nurse
it
is
now
only
a
question
of
getting
back
the
physical
strength
which
has
certainly
fallen
to
a
very
low
ebb
perfect
repose
and
an
entire
freedom
from
care
are
what
we
have
to
look
to
this
the
nurse
told
gilbert
he
has
been
very
restless
all
day
she
added
though
i
done
what
i
could
to
keep
him
quiet
but
he
worries
himself
now
that
his
senses
have
come
back
poor
gentleman
and
it
easy
to
soothe
him
any
way
he
keeps
on
wondering
when
he
be
well
enough
to
move
and
so
on
over
and
over
again
once
when
i
left
the
room
for
a
minute
and
went
back
again
i
found
him
attempting
to
get
out
of
bed
only
to
try
his
strength
he
said
but
he
no
more
strength
than
a
baby
poor
soul
and
it
will
be
weeks
before
he
able
to
stir
if
he
worries
and
frets
he
put
himself
back
for
a
certainty
but
i
daresay
you
have
more
influence
over
him
than
i
sir
and
that
you
may
be
able
to
keep
him
quiet
i
doubt
that
answered
gilbert
but
i
do
my
best
has
he
been
delirious
no
sir
not
once
and
of
course
that
a
great
thing
gained
a
feeble
voice
from
the
inner
room
called
gilbert
by
name
presently
and
he
went
in
at
its
bidding
is
that
you
gilbert
come
in
for
pity
sake
i
was
sure
of
the
voice
so
you
have
come
on
your
errand
of
charity
once
more
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
though
you
are
not
my
friend
sit
down
ministering
christian
sit
by
my
side
i
have
some
questions
to
ask
you
you
must
not
talk
much
john
the
doctor
insists
upon
perfect
tranquillity
he
might
just
as
well
insist
upon
my
making
myself
emperor
of
all
the
russias
one
demand
would
be
about
as
reasonable
as
the
other
how
long
have
i
been
lying
here
like
a
log
a
troublesome
log
by
the
way
for
i
find
from
some
hints
the
nurse
dropped
as
to
the
blessing
of
my
recovery
that
i
have
been
somewhat
given
to
violence
how
long
have
i
been
ill
gilbert
a
very
long
time
give
me
a
categorical
answer
how
many
weeks
and
days
you
were
taken
ill
about
the
middle
of
december
and
we
are
now
in
the
first
week
of
february
nearly
two
months
and
in
all
that
time
i
have
been
idle
no
remittances
from
publishers
how
have
i
lived
gilbert
how
have
the
current
expenses
of
my
illness
been
paid
and
the
children
of
israel
have
they
not
been
clamorous
there
was
a
bill
due
in
january
i
know
i
was
working
for
that
when
i
got
pulled
up
how
is
it
that
my
vile
carcass
is
not
in
their
hands
you
need
give
yourself
no
trouble
the
bill
has
been
taken
up
by
you
of
course
yes
you
do
not
deny
it
and
you
have
been
spending
your
money
day
by
day
to
keep
me
alive
but
then
you
would
have
done
as
much
for
a
stranger
great
heaven
what
a
mean
hound
i
seem
to
myself
as
i
lie
here
and
think
what
you
have
done
for
me
and
how
i
have
acted
towards
you
he
turned
himself
in
his
bed
with
a
great
effort
and
lay
with
his
face
to
the
wall
let
me
hide
my
face
from
you
he
said
i
am
a
shameful
creature
believe
me
once
more
there
is
not
the
faintest
shadow
of
an
obligation
gilbert
responded
eagerly
i
can
very
well
afford
anything
i
have
done
shall
never
feel
myself
the
poorer
for
it
by
a
sixpence
i
can
not
bear
that
these
things
should
be
spoken
of
between
us
you
know
how
often
i
have
begged
you
to
let
me
help
you
in
the
past
and
how
wounded
i
have
been
by
your
refusal
yes
when
we
were
friends
before
i
had
ever
wronged
you
if
i
had
taken
your
help
then
i
should
hardly
have
felt
the
obligation
but
stay
i
am
not
such
a
pauper
as
i
seem
my
wife
will
have
money
at
least
you
told
me
that
the
old
man
was
rich
yes
your
wife
will
have
money
plenty
of
money
you
have
no
need
to
trouble
yourself
about
financial
matters
you
have
only
to
consider
what
the
doctor
has
said
your
recovery
depends
almost
entirely
upon
your
tranquillity
of
mind
if
you
want
to
get
well
speedily
you
must
remember
this
i
do
want
to
get
well
i
am
in
a
fever
to
get
well
i
want
to
see
my
wife
but
my
recovery
will
be
evidently
a
tedious
affair
i
can
not
wait
to
see
her
till
i
am
strong
enough
to
travel
why
should
she
not
come
to
me
here
she
can
she
must
come
write
to
her
gilbert
tell
her
how
i
languish
for
her
presence
tell
her
how
ill
i
have
been
yes
i
will
write
by
and
by
by
and
by
your
tone
tells
me
that
you
do
not
mean
what
you
say
there
is
something
you
are
keeping
from
me
o
my
god
what
was
that
happened
before
i
was
ill
my
wife
was
missing
i
was
hunting
for
her
without
rest
for
nearly
a
week
and
then
they
told
me
she
was
drowned
that
there
was
no
hope
of
finding
her
was
that
real
gilbert
or
only
a
part
of
my
delirium
speak
to
me
for
pity
sake
was
it
real
yes
john
your
perplexity
and
trouble
were
real
but
unnecessary
your
wife
is
safe
safe
where
she
is
with
her
father
she
did
not
even
know
that
her
father
was
living
no
not
till
very
lately
he
has
come
home
from
america
it
seems
and
marian
is
now
under
his
protection
what
she
could
desert
me
without
a
word
of
warning
without
the
faintest
hint
of
her
intention
to
go
to
a
father
of
whom
she
knew
nothing
or
nothing
that
was
not
eminently
to
his
discredit
there
may
have
been
some
strong
influence
brought
to
bear
to
induce
her
to
take
such
a
step
what
influence
do
not
worry
yourself
about
that
now
make
all
haste
to
get
well
and
then
it
will
be
easy
for
you
to
win
her
back
yes
only
place
me
face
to
face
with
her
and
i
do
not
think
there
would
be
much
question
as
to
that
but
that
she
should
forsake
me
of
her
own
free
will
it
is
so
unlike
my
marian
my
patient
marian
i
can
scarcely
believe
such
a
thing
possible
but
that
question
can
soon
be
put
at
rest
write
to
her
gilbert
tell
her
that
i
have
been
at
death
door
that
my
chance
of
recovery
hangs
upon
her
will
father
or
no
father
will
bring
her
to
my
side
i
will
do
so
directly
i
know
her
address
you
do
not
know
where
she
is
not
yet
i
am
expecting
to
obtain
that
information
every
day
i
have
taken
measures
to
ascertain
where
she
is
and
how
do
you
know
that
she
is
with
her
father
i
have
the
lawyer
authority
for
that
a
lawyer
whom
the
old
man
jacob
nowell
trusted
whom
he
left
sole
executor
to
his
will
it
was
necessary
above
all
things
that
john
saltram
mind
should
be
set
at
rest
and
in
order
to
secure
this
result
gilbert
was
fain
to
affect
a
supreme
faith
in
medler
you
believe
this
man
gilbert
the
invalid
asked
anxiously
of
course
he
has
no
reason
for
deceiving
me
but
why
withhold
the
father
address
it
is
easy
enough
to
conjecture
his
reasons
for
that
a
dread
of
your
influence
robbing
him
of
his
daughter
her
fortune
has
made
her
a
prize
worth
disputing
you
see
it
is
natural
enough
that
the
father
should
wish
to
hide
her
from
you
for
the
sake
of
the
money
yes
i
suppose
that
is
the
beginning
and
end
of
his
scheme
my
poor
girl
no
doubt
he
has
told
her
all
manner
of
lies
about
me
and
so
contrived
to
estrange
that
faithful
heart
will
you
insert
an
advertisement
in
the
gilbert
under
initials
telling
her
of
my
illness
and
entreating
her
to
come
to
me
i
will
do
so
if
you
like
but
i
daresay
nowell
will
be
cautious
enough
to
keep
the
away
from
her
or
to
watch
it
pretty
closely
and
prevent
her
seeing
anything
we
may
insert
i
am
taking
means
to
find
them
john
i
must
entreat
you
to
rest
satisfied
with
that
rest
satisfied
when
i
am
uncertain
whether
i
shall
ever
see
my
wife
again
that
is
a
hard
thing
to
do
if
you
harass
yourself
you
will
not
live
to
see
her
again
trust
in
me
john
marian
safety
is
as
dear
to
me
as
it
can
be
to
you
i
am
her
sworn
friend
and
brother
her
guardian
and
defender
i
have
skilled
agents
at
work
we
shall
find
her
rely
upon
it
it
was
a
strange
position
into
which
gilbert
found
himself
drifting
the
consoler
of
this
man
who
had
so
basely
robbed
him
they
could
never
be
friends
again
these
two
he
had
told
himself
that
not
once
but
many
times
during
the
weary
hours
of
his
watching
beside
john
they
could
never
more
be
friends
and
yet
he
found
himself
in
a
manner
compelled
to
perform
the
offices
of
friendship
nor
was
it
easy
to
preserve
anything
like
the
neutral
standing
which
he
had
designed
for
himself
the
life
of
this
sometime
friend
of
his
hung
by
so
frail
a
link
he
had
such
utter
need
of
kindness
so
what
could
gilbert
do
but
console
him
for
the
loss
of
his
wife
and
endeavour
to
inspire
him
with
a
hopeful
spirit
about
her
what
could
he
do
less
than
friendship
would
have
done
although
his
affection
for
this
old
friend
of
his
youth
had
perished
for
evermore
the
task
of
consolation
was
not
an
easy
one
once
restored
to
his
right
mind
with
a
vivid
sense
of
all
that
had
happened
to
him
before
his
illness
john
saltram
was
not
to
be
beguiled
into
a
false
security
the
idea
that
his
wife
was
in
dangerous
hands
pursued
him
perpetually
and
the
consciousness
of
his
own
impotence
to
rescue
her
goaded
him
to
a
kind
of
mental
fever
to
be
chained
here
gilbert
lying
on
this
odious
bed
like
a
dog
when
she
needs
my
help
how
am
i
to
bear
it
like
a
man
the
other
answered
quietly
were
you
as
well
as
i
am
this
moment
there
nothing
you
could
do
that
i
am
not
doing
do
you
think
i
should
sit
idly
here
if
the
best
measures
had
not
been
taken
to
find
your
wife
forgive
me
yes
i
have
no
doubt
you
have
done
what
is
best
but
if
i
were
astir
i
should
have
the
sense
of
doing
something
i
could
urge
on
those
people
you
employ
work
with
them
even
you
would
be
more
likely
to
hinder
than
to
assist
them
they
know
their
work
and
it
is
a
slow
drudging
business
at
best
which
requires
more
patience
than
you
possess
no
john
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
wait
and
put
our
trust
in
providence
and
in
time
this
was
a
sermon
which
gilbert
fenton
had
occasion
to
preach
very
often
in
the
slow
weary
days
that
followed
john
saltram
recovery
of
his
right
senses
the
sick
man
tossing
to
and
fro
upon
the
bed
he
loathed
with
such
an
utter
loathing
could
not
refrain
from
piteous
bewailings
of
his
helplessness
he
was
not
a
good
subject
for
sickness
had
never
served
his
apprenticeship
to
a
until
now
and
the
ordeal
seemed
to
him
a
very
long
one
in
all
that
period
of
his
delirious
wanderings
there
had
been
an
exaggerated
sense
of
time
in
his
mind
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
lying
there
for
years
lost
in
a
labyrinth
of
demented
fancies
looking
back
at
that
time
now
that
his
reason
had
been
restored
to
him
he
was
able
to
recall
his
delusions
one
by
one
and
it
was
very
difficult
for
him
to
understand
even
now
that
they
were
all
utterly
groundless
the
mere
vagabondage
of
a
wandering
brain
that
the
people
he
had
fancied
close
at
hand
lurking
in
the
next
room
he
had
rarely
seen
them
close
about
his
bed
but
had
been
possessed
with
a
vivid
sense
of
their
neighbourhood
had
been
never
near
him
that
the
old
friends
and
associates
of
his
boyhood
who
had
been
amongst
these
fancied
visitors
were
for
the
greater
number
dead
and
passed
away
long
before
this
time
that
he
had
been
in
every
dream
and
every
fancy
of
that
weary
interval
the
abject
slave
of
his
own
hallucinations
little
by
little
his
strength
came
back
to
him
by
very
slow
degrees
so
slowly
indeed
that
the
process
of
recovery
might
have
sorely
tried
the
patience
of
any
man
less
patient
than
gilbert
there
came
a
day
at
last
when
the
convalescent
was
able
to
leave
his
bed
for
an
hour
or
so
just
strong
enough
to
crawl
into
the
with
the
help
of
gilbert
arm
and
to
sit
in
an
propped
up
by
pillows
very
feeble
of
aspect
and
with
a
wan
haggard
countenance
that
pleaded
mutely
for
pity
it
was
impossible
to
harbour
revengeful
feelings
against
a
wretch
so
stricken
mew
was
much
elated
by
this
gradual
improvement
in
his
patient
and
confessed
to
gilbert
in
private
that
he
had
never
hoped
for
so
happy
a
result
nothing
but
an
iron
constitution
and
your
admirable
care
could
have
carried
our
friend
through
such
an
attack
sir
he
said
decisively
and
now
that
we
are
getting
round
a
little
we
must
have
change
of
air
change
of
air
and
of
scene
that
is
imperatively
necessary
saltram
talks
of
a
loathing
for
these
rooms
very
natural
under
the
circumstances
we
must
take
him
away
directly
he
can
bear
the
removal
i
rather
doubt
his
willingness
to
stir
gilbert
answered
thoughtfully
he
has
anxieties
that
are
likely
to
chain
him
to
london
if
there
is
any
objection
of
that
kind
it
must
be
conquered
mew
said
a
change
will
do
your
friend
more
good
than
all
the
physic
i
can
give
him
where
would
you
advise
me
to
take
him
not
very
far
he
could
stand
the
fatigue
of
a
long
journey
i
should
take
him
to
some
quiet
little
place
near
town
the
more
countrified
the
better
it
is
a
very
pleasant
season
for
the
country
but
in
spite
of
that
the
change
will
do
him
good
gilbert
promised
to
effect
this
arrangement
as
soon
as
the
patient
was
well
enough
to
be
moved
he
would
run
down
to
hampton
or
kingston
he
told
mew
in
a
day
or
two
and
look
for
suitable
lodgings
hampton
or
kingston
by
all
means
replied
the
surgeon
cheerily
both
very
pleasant
places
in
their
way
and
as
mild
as
any
neighbourhood
within
easy
reach
of
town
do
go
too
near
the
water
and
be
sure
your
rooms
are
dry
and
airy
that
the
main
point
we
might
move
him
early
next
week
i
fancy
if
we
get
him
up
for
an
hour
or
two
every
day
in
the
interval
gilbert
had
kept
branston
very
well
informed
as
to
john
progress
and
that
impetuous
little
woman
had
sent
a
ponderous
retainer
of
the
footman
species
to
the
temple
daily
laden
now
with
hothouse
grapes
and
anon
with
dainty
jellies
clear
or
delicate
preparations
of
chicken
blancmanges
and
iced
drinks
the
conveyance
whereof
was
a
sore
grievance
to
the
ponderous
domestic
in
spite
of
all
the
aid
to
be
derived
from
a
liberal
employment
of
cabs
adela
branston
had
sent
these
things
in
defiance
of
her
outraged
kinswoman
pallinson
who
was
not
slow
to
descant
upon
the
impropriety
of
such
a
proceeding
i
wonder
you
can
talk
in
such
a
way
when
you
know
how
friendless
this
poor
saltram
is
and
how
little
trouble
it
costs
me
to
do
as
much
as
this
for
him
but
i
daresay
the
good
samaritan
had
some
one
at
home
who
objected
to
the
waste
of
that
twopence
he
paid
for
the
poor
traveller
pallinson
gave
a
little
shriek
of
horror
on
hearing
this
allusion
and
protested
against
so
profane
a
use
of
the
gospel
but
the
gospel
was
meant
to
be
our
guide
in
common
things
was
it
pallinson
however
there
not
the
least
use
in
your
being
angry
for
i
mean
to
do
what
i
can
for
saltram
and
there
no
one
in
the
world
could
turn
me
from
my
intention
indeed
cried
the
elder
lady
indignantly
and
when
he
recovers
you
mean
to
marry
him
i
daresay
you
will
be
weak
enough
to
throw
away
your
fortune
upon
a
profligate
and
a
spendthrift
a
man
who
is
certain
to
make
any
woman
miserable
and
hereupon
there
arose
what
sheridan
calls
a
very
pretty
quarrel
between
the
two
ladies
which
went
very
near
to
end
in
total
withdrawal
from
very
nearly
but
not
quite
to
that
agreeable
consummation
did
matters
proceed
for
on
the
very
verge
of
the
final
words
which
could
have
spoken
the
sentence
of
separation
pallinson
was
suddenly
melted
and
declared
that
nothing
no
outrage
of
her
feelings
and
heaven
knows
how
they
have
been
trodden
on
this
day
the
injured
matron
added
in
parenthesis
should
induce
her
to
desert
her
dearest
adela
and
so
there
was
a
hollow
peace
patched
up
and
branston
felt
that
the
blessings
of
freedom
the
delightful
relief
of
an
escape
from
pallinsonian
influences
were
not
yet
to
be
hers
directly
she
heard
from
gilbert
that
change
of
air
had
been
ordered
for
the
patient
she
was
eager
to
offer
her
villa
near
maidenhead
for
his
accommodation
the
house
is
always
kept
in
order
she
wrote
to
gilbert
and
i
can
send
down
more
servants
to
make
everything
comfortable
for
the
invalid
i
know
he
is
fond
of
the
place
she
added
in
conclusion
after
setting
out
all
the
merits
of
the
villa
with
feminine
minuteness
at
least
i
know
he
used
to
like
it
and
i
think
it
would
please
him
to
get
well
there
i
can
only
say
that
it
would
make
very
happy
so
do
arrange
it
dear
fenton
if
possible
and
oblige
yours
ever
faithfully
adela
branston
poor
little
woman
murmured
gilbert
as
he
finished
the
letter
no
we
will
not
impose
upon
her
kindness
we
will
go
somewhere
else
better
for
her
that
she
should
see
and
hear
but
little
of
john
saltram
for
all
time
to
come
and
then
the
foolish
fancy
will
wear
itself
out
perhaps
and
she
may
live
to
be
a
happy
wife
yet
unless
she
too
is
afflicted
with
the
fatal
capability
of
constancy
is
that
such
a
common
quality
i
wonder
are
there
many
so
luckless
as
to
love
once
and
once
only
and
who
setting
all
their
hopes
upon
one
cast
lose
all
if
that
be
fatal
gilbert
told
john
saltram
of
branston
offer
which
he
was
as
prompt
to
decline
as
gilbert
himself
had
been
it
is
like
her
to
wish
it
he
said
but
no
i
should
feel
myself
a
double
traitor
and
impostor
under
her
roof
i
have
done
her
wrong
enough
already
if
i
could
have
loved
her
gilbert
all
might
have
been
well
for
you
and
me
god
knows
i
tried
to
love
her
poor
little
woman
and
she
is
just
the
kind
of
woman
who
might
twine
herself
about
any
man
heart
graceful
pretty
gracious
tender
bright
and
intelligent
enough
for
any
man
and
not
too
clever
but
heart
she
never
touched
from
the
hour
i
saw
that
i
was
lost
i
will
tell
you
all
about
that
some
day
no
we
will
not
go
to
the
villa
write
and
give
branston
my
best
thanks
for
the
generous
offer
and
invent
some
excuse
for
declining
it
that
a
good
fellow
when
the
letter
was
written
john
saltram
said
i
do
not
want
to
go
out
of
town
at
all
gilbert
it
no
use
for
the
doctor
to
talk
i
ca
leave
london
till
we
have
news
of
marian
gilbert
had
been
prepared
for
this
and
set
himself
to
argue
the
point
with
admirable
patience
proul
work
would
go
on
just
as
well
he
urged
whether
they
were
in
london
or
at
hampton
a
telegram
would
bring
them
any
tidings
as
quickly
in
the
one
place
as
the
other
i
am
not
asking
you
to
go
far
remember
he
added
you
will
be
within
an
journey
of
london
and
the
doctors
declare
this
change
is
indispensable
to
your
recovery
you
have
told
us
what
a
horror
you
have
of
these
rooms
yes
i
doubt
if
any
one
but
a
sick
man
can
understand
his
loathing
of
the
scene
of
his
illness
that
room
in
there
is
filled
with
the
shadows
that
haunted
me
in
all
those
miserable
nights
when
the
fever
was
at
its
worst
and
i
lived
amidst
a
crowd
of
phantoms
yes
i
do
most
profoundly
hate
that
room
as
for
this
matter
of
change
of
air
gilbert
dispose
of
me
as
you
please
my
worthless
existence
belongs
to
you
gilbert
was
quick
to
take
advantage
of
this
concession
he
went
down
to
hampton
next
day
and
explored
the
neighbourhood
on
both
sides
of
the
thames
his
choice
fell
at
last
on
a
pretty
little
house
within
a
throw
of
the
palace
gates
the
back
windows
whereof
looked
out
upon
the
now
leafless
solitude
of
bushy
park
and
where
there
was
a
landlady
whose
countenance
was
very
pleasant
to
contemplate
after
the
somewhat
lachrymose
visage
of
pratt
here
he
found
he
could
have
all
the
accommodation
he
required
and
hither
he
promised
to
bring
the
invalid
early
in
the
following
week
there
were
as
yet
no
tidings
worth
speaking
of
from
proul
that
distinguished
member
of
the
detective
profession
waited
upon
gilbert
fenton
with
his
budget
twice
a
week
but
the
budget
was
a
barren
one
proul
agent
pronounced
medler
clerk
the
toughest
individual
it
had
ever
been
his
lot
to
deal
with
no
amount
of
treating
at
the
round
the
corner
and
the
agent
had
ascended
from
the
primitive
simplicity
of
a
pint
of
porter
to
the
highest
flights
in
the
art
of
compound
liquors
could
exert
a
softening
influence
upon
that
rigid
nature
either
the
clerk
knew
nothing
about
percival
nowell
or
had
been
so
well
schooled
as
to
disclose
nothing
of
what
he
knew
money
had
been
employed
by
the
agent
as
well
as
drink
as
a
means
of
temptation
but
even
every
insidious
hint
of
possible
gains
had
failed
to
move
the
underling
to
any
revelation
it
my
belief
the
man
knows
nothing
or
else
i
should
have
had
it
out
of
him
by
hook
or
by
crook
proul
agent
told
him
and
proul
repeated
to
his
client
this
first
agent
having
thus
come
to
grief
and
having
perhaps
made
himself
a
suspected
person
in
the
eyes
of
the
medler
office
by
his
manoeuvres
a
second
spy
had
been
placed
to
keep
close
watch
upon
the
house
and
to
follow
any
person
who
at
all
corresponded
with
the
detective
idea
of
nowell
it
could
be
no
more
than
an
idea
unfortunately
since
gilbert
had
been
able
to
give
the
accomplished
proul
no
description
of
the
man
he
wanted
to
trace
above
all
the
spy
was
to
take
special
note
of
any
lady
who
might
be
seen
to
enter
or
leave
the
office
and
to
this
end
he
was
furnished
with
a
close
description
of
marian
gilbert
called
upon
branston
before
carrying
john
saltram
out
of
town
he
fancied
that
her
offer
of
the
maidenhead
villa
would
be
better
acknowledged
personally
than
by
a
letter
he
found
the
pretty
little
widow
sorely
disappointed
by
saltram
refusal
to
occupy
her
house
and
it
was
a
little
difficult
to
explain
to
her
why
they
both
preferred
other
quarters
for
the
convalescent
why
will
he
not
accept
the
smallest
favour
from
me
adela
branston
asked
plaintively
he
ought
to
know
that
there
is
no
in
any
offer
which
i
make
him
that
i
have
no
wish
except
for
his
welfare
why
does
he
not
trust
me
a
little
more
he
will
do
so
in
future
i
think
branston
gilbert
answered
gravely
i
fancy
he
has
learned
the
folly
and
danger
of
all
underhand
policy
and
that
he
will
put
more
faith
in
his
friends
for
the
rest
of
his
life
and
he
is
really
much
better
quite
out
of
danger
do
the
doctors
say
that
he
is
as
much
out
of
danger
as
a
man
can
well
be
whose
strength
has
all
been
wasted
in
a
perilous
illness
he
has
that
to
regain
yet
and
the
recovery
will
be
slow
work
of
course
in
his
condition
a
relapse
would
be
fatal
but
there
is
no
occasion
to
apprehend
a
relapse
thank
heaven
for
that
and
you
will
take
care
of
him
fenton
will
you
not
i
will
do
my
very
best
he
saved
my
life
once
so
you
see
that
i
owe
him
a
life
the
invalid
was
conveyed
to
hampton
on
a
bright
february
day
when
there
was
an
agreeable
glimpse
of
spring
sunshine
he
went
down
by
road
in
a
hired
brougham
and
the
journey
seemed
a
long
one
but
it
was
an
unspeakable
relief
to
john
saltram
to
see
the
suburban
roads
and
green
fields
after
the
long
imprisonment
of
the
temple
a
relief
that
moved
him
almost
to
tears
in
his
extreme
weakness
could
you
believe
that
a
man
would
be
so
childish
gilbert
he
said
apologetically
it
might
have
been
a
good
thing
for
me
to
have
died
in
that
dismal
room
for
heaven
only
knows
what
heavy
sorrow
lies
before
me
in
the
future
yet
the
sight
of
these
common
things
touches
me
more
keenly
than
all
the
glory
of
the
jungfrau
touched
me
ten
years
ago
what
a
gay
world
it
is
and
yet
how
many
people
are
happy
in
it
how
many
take
the
right
road
i
suppose
there
is
a
right
road
by
which
we
all
might
travel
if
we
only
knew
how
to
choose
it
he
felt
the
physical
weariness
of
the
journey
acutely
but
uttered
no
complaint
throughout
the
way
though
gilbert
could
see
the
pale
face
growing
paler
the
sunken
cheeks
more
pinched
of
aspect
as
they
went
on
to
the
last
he
pronounced
himself
delighted
by
that
quiet
progress
through
the
familiar
landscape
and
then
having
reached
his
destination
had
barely
strength
to
totter
to
a
comfortable
sofa
in
the
parlour
where
he
fainted
away
the
professional
nurse
had
been
dismissed
before
they
left
london
and
gilbert
was
now
the
only
attendant
the
woman
had
performed
her
office
tolerably
well
after
the
manner
of
her
kind
but
the
presence
of
a
sick
nurse
is
not
a
cheering
influence
and
john
saltram
was
infinitely
relieved
by
her
disappearance
how
good
you
are
to
me
gilbert
he
said
that
first
evening
of
his
sojourn
at
hampton
after
he
had
recovered
from
his
faint
and
was
lying
on
the
sofa
sipping
a
cup
of
tea
how
good
and
yet
you
are
my
friend
no
longer
all
friendship
is
at
an
end
between
us
well
god
knows
i
am
as
helpless
as
that
man
who
fell
among
thieves
i
can
not
choose
but
accept
your
bounty
chapter
xxxviii
an
wedding
after
that
promise
wrung
from
her
by
such
a
cruel
agony
that
fatal
bond
made
between
her
and
stephen
whitelaw
ellen
carley
life
seemed
to
travel
past
her
as
if
by
some
enchantment
time
lost
its
familiar
sluggishness
the
long
industrious
days
that
had
been
so
slow
of
old
flew
by
the
bailiff
daughter
like
the
shadows
from
a
at
the
first
after
that
desperate
miserable
day
upon
which
the
hateful
words
were
uttered
that
were
to
bind
her
for
life
to
a
detested
master
the
girl
had
told
herself
that
something
must
happen
to
prevent
the
carrying
out
of
this
abhorrent
bargain
something
would
happen
she
had
a
vague
faith
that
providence
would
interfere
somehow
to
save
her
day
after
day
she
looked
into
her
father
face
thinking
that
from
him
perhaps
might
come
some
sign
of
wavering
some
hint
of
possible
release
vain
hope
the
bailiff
having
exacted
the
sacrifice
pretended
to
think
his
daughter
welfare
secured
by
that
very
act
he
did
not
hesitate
to
congratulate
her
on
her
good
fortune
and
to
protest
with
an
accustomed
oath
that
there
was
not
a
sensible
woman
in
england
who
would
not
envy
her
so
excellent
a
match
once
poor
ellen
always
impetuous
and
lost
all
patience
with
him
and
asked
how
he
dared
to
say
such
things
you
know
that
i
hate
this
man
father
she
cried
passionately
and
that
i
hate
myself
for
what
i
am
going
to
do
you
know
that
i
have
promised
to
be
his
wife
for
your
sake
for
your
sake
only
and
that
if
i
could
have
saved
you
from
disgrace
by
giving
you
my
life
i
should
have
done
it
gladly
to
escape
this
much
greater
sacrifice
never
speak
to
me
about
stephen
whitelaw
again
father
unless
you
want
to
drive
me
mad
let
me
forget
what
sin
i
am
going
to
commit
if
i
can
let
me
go
on
blindfold
it
was
to
be
observed
that
from
the
hour
of
her
betrothal
ellen
carley
as
far
as
possible
avoided
her
father
companionship
she
worked
more
busily
than
ever
about
the
big
old
house
was
never
tired
of
polishing
the
furniture
and
dusting
the
tenantless
she
seemed
indeed
to
be
infected
with
tadman
passion
for
superhuman
cleanliness
to
her
dairy
duties
also
she
devoted
much
more
time
than
of
old
anything
to
escape
the
parlour
where
her
father
sat
idle
for
a
considerable
portion
of
the
day
smoking
his
pipe
and
drinking
rather
more
than
was
good
for
him
nor
did
carley
for
his
part
appear
to
dislike
this
tacit
severance
between
his
daughter
and
himself
as
the
foolish
young
woman
chose
to
accept
good
fortune
in
a
perverse
spirit
it
was
well
that
they
two
should
see
as
little
of
each
other
as
possible
every
evening
found
whitelaw
a
punctual
visitor
in
the
snug
panelled
parlour
and
at
such
times
the
bailiff
insisted
upon
his
presence
she
was
obliged
to
sit
there
night
after
night
stitching
monotonously
at
some
unknown
calico
garment
which
might
well
from
the
state
of
mind
of
the
worker
have
been
her
or
darning
one
of
an
inexhaustible
basket
of
woollen
stockings
belonging
to
her
father
it
was
her
irksome
duty
to
be
there
ready
to
receive
any
awkward
compliment
of
her
silent
lover
ready
to
acquiesce
meekly
in
his
talk
of
their
approaching
wedding
but
at
all
other
times
carley
was
more
than
content
with
her
absence
at
first
the
bailiff
had
made
a
feeble
attempt
to
reconcile
his
daughter
to
her
position
by
the
common
bribe
of
fine
clothes
he
had
extorted
a
sum
of
money
from
stephen
whitelaw
for
this
purpose
and
had
given
that
sum
or
a
considerable
part
of
it
to
his
daughter
bidding
her
expend
it
upon
her
wedding
finery
the
girl
took
the
money
and
spent
a
few
pounds
upon
the
of
her
wardrobe
which
was
by
no
means
an
extensive
one
but
the
remaining
note
she
laid
by
in
a
secret
place
determined
on
no
account
to
break
in
upon
it
the
time
may
come
when
all
my
life
will
depend
upon
the
possession
of
a
few
pounds
she
said
to
herself
when
i
may
have
some
chance
of
setting
myself
free
from
that
man
she
had
begun
to
contemplate
such
a
possibility
already
before
her
it
was
for
her
father
sake
she
was
going
to
sell
her
liberty
to
take
upon
herself
a
bondage
most
odious
to
her
the
time
might
come
when
her
father
would
be
beyond
the
reach
of
shame
and
disgrace
when
she
might
find
some
manner
of
escape
from
her
slavery
in
the
meantime
the
days
hurried
on
and
providence
offered
her
no
present
means
of
rescue
the
day
of
doom
came
nearer
and
nearer
for
the
bailiff
took
part
with
his
future
and
would
hear
of
no
reasons
which
ellen
could
offer
for
delay
he
was
eager
to
squeeze
the
farmer
purse
a
little
tighter
and
he
fancied
he
might
do
this
when
his
daughter
was
stephen
whitelaw
wife
so
suitor
and
father
were
alike
pitiless
and
the
wedding
was
fixed
for
the
of
march
there
were
no
preparations
to
be
made
at
wyncomb
farmhouse
whitelaw
did
not
mean
to
waste
so
much
as
a
note
upon
the
embellishment
of
those
rooms
in
honour
of
his
bright
young
bride
although
tadman
urged
upon
him
the
necessity
of
new
muslin
curtains
here
and
new
dimity
there
a
coat
or
so
of
paint
and
new
whitewash
in
such
and
such
rooms
and
other
small
revivals
of
the
same
character
not
sorry
to
be
able
to
remind
him
in
this
indirect
manner
that
marriage
was
an
expensive
thing
a
young
woman
like
that
will
expect
to
see
things
bright
and
cheerful
about
her
said
tadman
in
her
most
plausible
tone
and
rubbing
her
thin
hands
with
an
air
of
suppressed
enjoyment
if
you
were
going
to
marry
a
person
of
your
own
age
it
would
be
different
of
course
but
young
women
have
such
extravagant
notions
i
could
see
miss
carley
did
not
think
much
of
the
furniture
when
i
took
her
over
the
house
on
she
said
the
rooms
looked
gloomy
and
that
some
of
them
gave
her
the
horrors
and
so
on
if
you
do
have
the
place
done
up
a
bit
at
first
you
have
to
get
it
done
at
last
depend
upon
it
a
young
wife
like
that
will
make
the
money
spin
you
may
be
sure
will
she
said
whitelaw
with
a
satisfied
grin
that
my
i
do
think
you
had
very
much
chance
of
making
my
money
spin
eh
mrs
tadman
the
widow
cast
up
her
hands
and
eyes
towards
the
ceiling
of
the
parlour
where
they
were
sitting
goodness
knows
i
had
precious
little
chance
of
doing
that
stephen
whitelaw
she
replied
i
should
reckon
not
and
my
wife
will
have
about
as
much
there
was
some
cold
comfort
in
this
tadman
had
once
hoped
that
if
her
cousin
ever
exalted
any
woman
to
the
proud
position
of
mistress
of
wyncomb
she
herself
would
be
that
favoured
individual
and
it
was
a
hard
thing
to
see
a
young
person
who
had
nothing
but
a
certain
amount
of
good
looks
to
recommend
her
raised
to
that
post
of
honour
in
her
stead
it
was
some
consolation
therefore
to
discover
that
the
interloper
was
to
reign
with
very
limited
powers
and
that
none
of
the
privileges
or
indulgences
usually
granted
to
youthful
brides
by
elderly
bridegrooms
were
to
be
hers
it
was
something
too
for
tadman
to
be
allowed
to
remain
beneath
the
familiar
shelter
of
that
gloomy
old
house
and
this
boon
had
been
granted
to
her
at
ellen
express
request
i
suppose
she
going
to
turn
lazy
as
soon
as
she
married
or
she
would
have
wanted
to
keep
you
the
farmer
said
in
rather
a
sulky
manner
after
he
had
given
tadman
his
gracious
permission
to
remain
in
his
service
but
if
she
is
we
must
find
some
way
of
curing
her
of
that
i
do
want
a
fine
lady
about
place
there
the
dairy
now
we
might
do
more
in
that
way
i
should
think
and
get
more
profit
out
of
than
we
do
by
sending
part
of
the
milk
up
to
london
butter
fetches
a
good
price
from
year
end
to
year
end
and
ellen
is
a
rare
hand
at
a
dairy
i
know
that
for
certain
thus
did
whitelaw
devote
his
pretty
young
wife
to
an
endless
prospect
of
he
had
no
intention
that
the
alliance
should
be
an
unprofitable
one
and
he
was
already
scheming
how
he
might
obtain
some
indirect
kind
of
interest
for
that
awful
sum
of
two
hundred
pounds
advanced
to
william
carley
sir
david
forster
had
not
come
to
make
that
threatened
investigation
of
things
at
the
grange
careless
always
in
the
management
of
his
affairs
the
receipt
of
a
handsome
sum
of
money
from
the
bailiff
had
satisfied
him
and
he
had
suffered
his
suspicions
to
be
lulled
to
rest
for
the
time
being
not
caring
to
undertake
the
trouble
of
a
journey
to
hampshire
and
an
examination
of
dry
business
details
it
was
very
lucky
for
carley
that
his
employer
was
so
easy
and
indolent
a
master
for
there
were
many
small
matters
at
the
grange
which
would
have
hardly
borne
inspection
and
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
sir
david
to
come
there
without
making
some
discovery
to
his
disadvantage
the
evil
day
had
been
warded
off
however
by
means
of
stephen
whitelaw
money
and
william
carley
meant
to
act
more
cautiously
more
honestly
even
in
future
he
would
keep
clear
of
and
gambling
booths
he
told
himself
and
of
the
kind
of
men
who
had
beguiled
him
into
dishonourable
dealing
i
have
had
an
uncommon
narrow
squeak
of
it
he
muttered
to
himself
occasionally
as
he
smoked
a
meditative
pipe
and
have
been
as
near
seeing
the
inside
of
portland
prison
as
ever
a
man
was
but
it
be
a
warning
to
me
in
future
and
yet
who
could
have
thought
that
things
would
have
gone
against
me
as
they
did
there
was
sir

for

that
brute
was
bound
to
win
february
came
to
an
end
and
when
march
once
began
there
seemed
no
pause
or
for
ellen
carley
till
the
and
yet
she
had
little
business
to
occupy
her
during
those
bleak
days
of
early
spring
it
was
the
horror
of
that
rapid
flight
of
time
which
seemed
independent
of
her
own
life
in
its
hideous
swiftness
idle
or
busy
it
was
all
the
same
the
days
would
not
linger
for
her
the
dreaded
was
close
at
hand
frank
randall
was
still
in
london
in
that
solicitor
office
a
firm
of
some
standing
in
the
city
to
which
he
had
gone
on
leaving
his
father
he
had
written
two
or
three
times
to
ellen
since
he
left
hampshire
and
she
had
answered
his
letters
secretly
but
pleasant
though
it
was
to
her
to
hear
from
him
she
begged
him
not
to
write
as
her
father
anger
would
be
extreme
if
a
letter
should
by
any
evil
chance
fall
into
his
hands
so
within
the
last
few
months
there
had
been
no
tidings
of
ellen
absent
lover
and
the
girl
was
glad
that
it
was
so
what
could
she
have
said
to
him
if
she
had
been
compelled
to
tell
him
of
her
engagement
to
stephen
whitelaw
what
excuse
could
she
have
made
for
marrying
a
man
about
whom
she
had
been
wont
to
express
herself
to
frank
randall
in
most
unequivocal
terms
excuse
there
was
none
since
she
could
not
betray
her
father
it
was
better
therefore
that
young
randall
should
hear
of
her
marriage
in
the
common
course
of
things
and
that
he
should
think
of
her
just
as
badly
as
he
pleased
this
was
only
one
more
poisoned
drop
in
a
cup
that
was
all
bitterness
he
will
believe
that
i
was
a
hypocrite
at
heart
always
the
unhappy
girl
said
to
herself
and
that
i
value
stephen
whitelaw
money
more
than
his
true
heart
that
i
can
marry
a
man
i
despise
and
dislike
for
the
sake
of
being
rich
what
can
he
think
worse
of
me
than
that
and
how
can
he
help
thinking
that
he
knows
that
i
have
a
good
spirit
of
my
own
and
that
my
father
could
not
make
me
do
anything
against
my
will
he
will
never
believe
that
this
marriage
has
been
all
my
father
doing
the
wedding
morning
came
at
last
bright
and
with
a
sun
that
shone
as
gaily
as
if
it
had
been
lighting
the
happiest
union
that
was
ever
recorded
in
the
hymeneal
register
there
were
the
first
rare
primroses
gleaming
amidst
the
early
greenery
of
high
grassy
banks
in
solitary
lanes
about
crosber
and
here
and
there
the
tender
blue
of
a
violet
it
would
have
seemed
a
very
fair
morning
upon
which
to
begin
the
first
page
in
the
mystic
volume
of
a
new
life
if
ellen
carley
had
been
going
to
marry
a
man
she
loved
but
no
hapless
condemned
wretch
who
ever
woke
to
see
the
sun
shining
upon
the
day
of
his
execution
could
have
been
more
profoundly
wretched
than
the
bailiff
daughter
as
she
dressed
herself
mechanically
in
her
one
smart
silk
gown
and
stood
in
a
kind
of
waking
trance
before
the
quaint
which
reflected
her
pale
hopeless
face
she
had
no
girlish
companion
to
assist
in
that
dismal
toilet
long
ago
there
had
been
promises
exchanged
between
ellen
carley
and
her
chosen
friend
the
daughter
of
a
miller
who
lived
a
little
way
on
the
other
side
of
crosber
to
the
effect
that
whichever
was
first
to
marry
should
call
upon
the
other
to
perform
the
office
of
bridesmaid
and
sarah
peters
the
miller
daughter
was
still
single
and
eligible
for
the
function
but
there
was
to
be
no
bridesmaid
at
this
blighted
wedding
ellen
had
pleaded
urgently
that
things
might
be
arranged
as
quietly
as
possible
and
the
master
of
wyncomb
who
hated
spending
money
and
who
apprehended
that
the
expenses
of
any
festivity
would
in
all
probability
fall
upon
his
own
shoulders
was
very
well
pleased
to
assent
to
this
request
of
his
betrothed
quite
right
nell
he
said
we
do
want
any
foolish
fuss
or
a
pack
of
people
making
themselves
drunk
at
our
expense
you
and
your
father
can
come
quietly
to
crosber
church
and
tadman
and
me
will
meet
you
there
and
the
thing
done
the
marriage
would
be
any
the
tighter
if
we
had
a
hundred
people
looking
on
and
the
bishop
of
winchester
to
read
the
service
it
was
arranged
in
this
manner
therefore
and
on
that
pleasant
spring
morning
william
carley
and
his
daughter
walked
to
the
quiet
village
where
gilbert
fenton
had
discovered
the
secret
of
marian
retreat
the
face
under
the
bride
little
straw
bonnet
was
deadly
pale
and
the
features
had
a
rigid
look
that
was
new
to
them
the
bailiff
glanced
at
his
daughter
in
a
furtive
way
every
now
and
then
with
an
uneasy
sense
of
this
strange
look
in
her
face
even
in
his
brute
nature
there
were
some
faint
twinges
of
compunction
now
that
the
deed
he
had
been
so
eager
to
compass
was
done
some
vague
consciousness
that
he
had
been
a
hard
and
cruel
father
and
yet
it
all
for
her
own
good
he
told
himself
quite
as
much
as
for
mine
better
to
marry
a
rich
man
than
a
pauper
any
day
and
to
take
a
dislike
to
a
man
age
or
a
man
looks
is
nothing
but
a
girl
nonsense
the
best
husband
is
the
one
that
can
keep
his
wife
best
and
if
i
forced
on
this
business
she
have
taken
up
with
lawyer
randall
son
who
no
better
than
a
beggar
and
a
pretty
life
she
have
had
of
it
with
him
by
such
reasoning
as
this
william
carley
contrived
to
set
his
conscience
at
rest
during
that
silent
walk
along
the
rustic
lane
between
the
grange
and
crosber
church
it
was
not
a
conscience
very
difficult
to
appease
and
as
for
his
daughter
pallid
looks
those
of
course
were
only
natural
to
the
occasion
whitelaw
and
tadman
were
at
the
church
when
the
bailiff
and
his
daughter
arrived
the
farmer
had
made
a
scarecrow
of
himself
in
a
new
suit
of
clothes
which
he
had
ordered
in
honour
of
this
important
event
after
a
great
deal
of
vacillation
and
more
than
one
countermand
to
the
malsham
tailor
who
made
the
garments
at
the
last
he
was
not
quite
clear
in
his
mind
as
to
whether
he
wanted
the
clothes
and
the
outlay
was
a
serious
one
tadman
had
need
to
hold
his
coat
up
to
the
light
to
convince
him
that
the
collar
was
threadbare
and
that
the
sleeves
shone
as
if
purposely
polished
by
some
ingenious
process
marriage
is
an
expensive
thing
she
told
him
again
with
a
sigh
and
young
girls
expect
to
see
a
man
dressed
ever
so
smart
on
his
i
do
care
for
her
expectations
whitelaw
muttered
in
reply
to
this
remark
and
if
i
do
want
the
clothes
i
wo
have
do
you
think
i
could
get
over
next
christmas
with
them
as
i
got
tadman
said
no
in
a
most
decisive
manner
perhaps
she
derived
a
malicious
pleasure
from
the
infliction
of
that
tailor
bill
upon
her
cousin
whitelaw
so
the
new
suit
had
been
finally
ordered
and
stephen
stood
arrayed
therein
before
the
in
the
gray
old
church
at
crosber
a
far
more
grotesque
and
outrageous
figure
to
contemplate
than
any
knight
templar
or
bearded
cavalier
of
the
days
of
the
first
english
james
whose
effigies
were
to
be
seen
in
the
chancel
tadman
stood
a
little
way
behind
him
in
a
merino
gown
and
a
new
bonnet
extorted
somehow
from
the
reluctant
stephen
she
was
full
of
smiles
and
cordial
greetings
for
the
bride
who
did
not
even
see
her
neither
did
ellen
carley
see
the
awkward
figure
of
her
bridegroom
a
mist
was
before
her
eyes
as
if
there
had
been
an
atmosphere
of
summer
blight
or
fog
in
the
village
church
she
knelt
or
rose
as
her
taught
her
and
went
through
the
solemn
service
as
placidly
as
if
she
had
been
a
wondrous
piece
of
mechanism
constructed
to
perform
such
movements
and
then
like
a
creature
in
a
dream
she
found
herself
walking
out
of
the
church
presently
with
her
hand
on
stephen
whitelaw
arm
she
had
a
faint
consciousness
of
some
ceremony
in
the
vestry
where
it
had
taken
stephen
a
long
time
to
sign
his
name
in
the
register
and
where
the
clergyman
had
congratulated
him
upon
his
good
fortune
in
having
won
for
himself
such
a
pretty
young
wife
but
it
was
all
more
or
less
like
a
dreadful
oppressive
dream
whitelaw
was
waiting
for
them
and
they
all
four
got
in
and
drove
at
once
to
wyncomb
where
there
was
another
ponderous
dinner
very
much
like
the
banquet
of
and
where
the
bailiff
drank
freely
after
his
wont
and
grew
somewhat
uproarious
towards
though
whitelaw
selections
of
port
and
sherry
were
not
of
a
kind
to
tempt
a
connoisseur
there
was
to
be
no
honeymoon
trip
stephen
whitelaw
did
not
understand
the
philosophy
of
running
away
from
a
comfortable
home
to
spend
money
in
furnished
lodgings
and
he
had
said
as
much
when
the
officious
tadman
suggested
a
run
to
weymouth
or
bournemouth
or
a
fortnight
in
the
isle
of
wight
to
ellen
it
was
all
the
same
where
the
rest
of
her
life
should
be
spent
it
could
not
be
otherwise
than
wretched
henceforward
and
the
scene
of
her
misery
mattered
nothing
so
she
uttered
no
complaint
because
her
husband
brought
her
straight
home
to
wyncomb
farmhouse
and
her
wedded
life
began
in
that
dreary
chapter
xxxix
a
domestic
mystery
it
was
near
the
end
of
march
but
still
bleak
cold
weather
ellen
carley
had
been
married
something
less
than
a
fortnight
and
had
come
to
look
upon
the
dismal
old
by
the
river
with
a
more
accustomed
eye
than
when
tadman
had
taken
her
from
room
to
room
on
a
journey
of
inspection
not
that
the
place
seemed
any
less
dreary
and
ugly
to
her
than
it
had
seemed
at
the
very
first
familiarity
could
not
make
it
pleasant
she
hated
the
house
and
everything
about
and
around
it
as
she
hated
her
husband
with
a
rooted
aversion
not
to
be
subdued
by
any
endeavour
which
she
might
make
now
and
then
and
she
did
honestly
make
such
endeavour
to
arrive
at
a
more
frame
of
mind
notwithstanding
this
instinctive
dislike
to
all
her
surroundings
she
endured
her
fate
quietly
and
did
her
duty
with
a
patient
spirit
which
might
fairly
be
accepted
as
an
atonement
for
those
inward
rebellious
feelings
which
she
could
not
conquer
having
submitted
to
be
the
scapegoat
of
her
father
sin
she
bore
her
burden
very
calmly
and
fulfilled
the
sacrifice
without
any
outward
mark
of
martyrdom
she
went
about
the
work
of
the
with
a
resolute
active
air
that
puzzled
tadman
who
had
fully
expected
the
young
wife
would
play
the
fine
lady
and
leave
all
the
drudgery
of
the
household
to
her
but
it
really
seemed
as
if
ellen
liked
hard
work
she
went
from
one
task
to
another
with
an
indefatigable
industry
an
energy
that
never
gave
way
only
when
the
day
work
in
house
and
dairy
was
done
did
her
depression
of
spirits
become
visible
then
indeed
when
all
was
finished
and
she
sat
down
neatly
dressed
for
the
afternoon
in
the
parlour
with
tadman
it
was
easy
to
see
how
utterly
hopeless
and
miserable
this
young
wife
was
the
pale
fixed
face
the
listless
hands
clasped
loosely
in
her
lap
every
attitude
of
the
drooping
figure
betrayed
the
joyless
spirit
the
broken
heart
at
these
times
when
they
were
alone
together
waiting
stephen
whitelaw
coming
home
to
tea
tadman
heart
not
entirely
hardened
by
long
years
of
yearned
towards
her
wife
and
the
secret
animosity
with
which
she
had
at
first
regarded
her
changed
to
a
silent
pity
a
compassion
she
would
fain
have
expressed
in
some
form
or
other
had
she
dared
but
she
could
not
venture
to
do
this
there
was
something
in
the
girl
a
quiet
air
of
pride
and
in
spite
of
her
too
evident
sadness
which
forbade
any
overt
expression
of
sympathy
so
tadman
could
only
show
her
friendly
feelings
in
a
very
small
way
by
being
especially
active
and
brisk
in
assisting
all
the
household
labours
of
the
new
mistress
of
wyncomb
and
by
endeavouring
to
cheer
her
with
such
petty
gossip
as
she
was
able
to
pick
up
ellen
felt
that
the
woman
was
kindly
disposed
towards
her
and
she
was
not
ungrateful
but
her
heart
was
quite
shut
against
sympathy
her
sorrow
was
too
profound
to
be
lightened
ever
so
little
by
human
friendship
it
was
a
dull
despair
a
settled
conviction
that
for
her
life
could
never
have
again
a
single
charm
that
her
days
must
go
on
in
their
slow
progress
to
the
grave
unlightened
by
one
ray
of
sunshine
her
burden
carried
to
the
end
of
the
dreary
journey
unrelieved
by
one
hour
of
respite
it
seemed
very
hard
for
one
so
young
not
quite
yet
to
turn
her
back
upon
every
hope
of
happiness
to
be
obliged
to
say
to
herself
for
me
the
sun
can
never
shine
again
the
world
i
live
in
can
never
more
seem
beautiful
or
beautiful
only
in
bitter
contrast
to
my
broken
heart
but
ellen
told
herself
that
this
fate
was
hers
and
that
she
must
needs
face
it
with
a
resolute
spirit
the
household
work
employed
her
mind
in
some
measure
and
kept
her
more
or
less
from
thinking
and
it
was
for
this
reason
she
worked
with
such
unflinching
industry
just
as
she
had
worked
in
the
last
month
or
two
at
the
grange
trying
to
shut
her
eyes
to
that
hateful
future
which
lay
so
close
before
her
whitelaw
had
no
reason
to
retract
what
he
had
said
in
his
pride
of
heart
about
ellen
carley
proficiency
in
the
dairy
she
proved
herself
all
that
he
had
boasted
and
the
dairy
flourished
under
the
new
management
there
was
more
butter
and
butter
of
a
superior
quality
sent
to
market
than
under
the
reign
of
tadman
and
the
master
of
wyncomb
made
haste
to
increase
his
stock
of
milch
cows
in
order
to
make
more
money
by
this
branch
of
his
business
to
have
won
for
himself
a
pretty
young
wife
who
instead
of
squandering
his
substance
would
help
him
to
grow
richer
was
indeed
a
triumph
upon
which
whitelaw
congratulated
himself
with
many
a
suppressed
chuckle
as
he
went
about
his
daily
labours
or
jogged
slowly
home
from
market
in
his
as
to
his
wife
feelings
towards
himself
whether
those
were
cold
indifference
or
hidden
dislike
that
was
an
abstruse
and
remote
question
which
whitelaw
never
took
the
trouble
to
ask
himself
she
was
his
wife
he
had
won
her
that
was
the
grand
point
whatever
disinclination
she
might
have
felt
for
the
alliance
whatever
love
she
might
have
cherished
for
another
had
been
trampled
down
and
subjugated
and
he
stephen
whitelaw
had
obtained
the
desire
of
his
heart
he
had
won
her
against
that
penniless
young
jackanapes
lawyer
randall
son
who
had
treated
him
with
marked
contempt
on
more
than
one
occasion
when
they
happened
to
come
across
each
other
in
malsham
which
was
held
in
the
great
covered
quadrangular
courtyard
of
the
chief
inn
at
malsham
and
was
a
popular
lounge
for
the
inhabitants
of
that
town
he
had
won
her
her
own
sentiments
upon
the
subject
of
this
marriage
were
of
very
little
consequence
he
had
never
expected
to
be
loved
by
his
wife
his
own
ideas
of
that
passion
called
love
being
of
the
vaguest
but
he
meant
to
be
obeyed
by
her
she
had
begun
well
had
taken
her
new
duties
upon
herself
in
a
manner
that
gladdened
his
sordid
soul
and
although
they
had
been
married
nearly
a
fortnight
she
had
given
no
hint
of
a
desire
to
know
the
extent
of
his
wealth
or
where
he
kept
any
little
hoard
of
ready
money
that
he
might
have
by
him
in
the
house
nor
on
had
she
expressed
any
wish
to
go
with
him
to
malsham
to
spend
money
on
drapery
and
he
had
an
idea
sedulously
cultivated
by
tadman
that
young
women
were
perpetually
wanting
to
spend
money
at
drapers
shops
altogether
that
first
fortnight
of
his
married
life
had
been
most
satisfactory
and
whitelaw
was
inclined
to
regard
matrimony
as
a
wise
and
profitable
institution
the
day
work
was
done
and
ellen
was
sitting
with
tadman
in
the
parlour
waiting
for
the
return
of
her
lord
and
master
from
malsham
it
was
not
a
but
stephen
whitelaw
had
announced
at
that
he
had
an
appointment
at
malsham
and
had
set
out
immediately
after
dinner
in
the
much
to
the
wonderment
of
tadman
who
was
an
inveterate
gossip
and
never
easy
until
she
arrived
at
the
bottom
of
any
small
household
mystery
she
wondered
not
a
little
also
at
ellen
supreme
indifference
to
her
husband
proceedings
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
think
what
taken
him
to
malsham
she
said
as
she
plied
her
rapid
in
the
manufacture
of
a
stocking
i
have
known
him
go
to
malsham
except
of
a
not
once
in
a
twelvemonth
it
must
be
a
rare
business
to
take
him
there
in
the
middle
of
the
week
for
he
ca
abide
to
leave
the
farm
in
except
when
he
right
down
obliged
to
it
nothing
goes
on
the
same
when
his
back
turned
he
says
there
always
something
wrong
and
if
it
was
an
appointment
with
any
one
belonging
to
malsham
why
could
it
have
stood
over
till
saturday
it
must
be
something
out
of
the
common
that
wo
keep
a
couple
of
days
tadman
went
on
with
her
knitting
gazing
at
ellen
with
an
expectant
countenance
waiting
for
her
to
make
some
suggestion
but
the
girl
was
quite
silent
and
there
was
a
blank
expression
in
her
eyes
which
looked
out
across
the
level
stretch
of
grass
between
the
house
and
the
river
a
look
that
told
tadman
very
few
of
her
words
had
been
heard
by
her
companion
it
was
quite
disheartening
to
talk
to
such
a
person
but
the
widow
went
on
nevertheless
being
so
full
of
her
subject
that
she
must
needs
talk
to
some
one
even
if
that
some
one
were
little
better
than
a
stock
or
a
stone
there
was
a
letter
that
came
for
stephen
before
dinner
he
got
it
when
he
came
in
but
it
was
lying
here
for
an
hour
first
perhaps
it
was
that
as
took
him
to
malsham
and
yet
that
strange
for
it
was
a
london
letter
and
it
do
seem
likely
as
any
one
could
be
coming
down
from
london
to
meet
steph
at
malsham
i
ca
make
top
nor
tail
of
it
tadman
laid
down
her
knitting
and
gave
the
fire
a
vigorous
stir
she
wanted
some
vent
for
her
vexation
for
it
was
really
too
provoking
to
see
ellen
whitelaw
sitting
staring
out
of
the
window
like
a
lifeless
statue
and
not
taking
the
faintest
interest
in
the
mystery
of
her
husband
conduct
she
stirred
the
fire
and
then
busied
herself
with
the
giving
a
touch
here
and
there
where
no
was
wanted
for
the
sake
of
doing
something
the
room
looked
comfortable
enough
in
the
cold
light
of
the
spring
afternoon
it
was
the
most
occupied
room
in
the
house
and
the
least
gloomy
the
glow
of
a
good
fire
brightened
the
scanty
shabby
furniture
a
little
and
the
table
with
its
white
cloth
homely
flowered
cups
and
saucers
bright
metal
teapot
and
substantial
fare
in
the
way
of
ham
and
bread
had
a
pleasant
look
enough
in
the
eyes
of
any
one
coming
in
from
a
journey
through
the
chill
march
atmosphere
notion
of
tea
was
a
solid
meal
which
left
him
independent
of
the
chances
of
supper
and
yet
open
to
do
something
in
that
way
in
case
any
light
kickshaw
such
as
liver
and
bacon
a
boiled
sheep
head
or
a
pie
should
present
itself
to
his
notice
ellen
roused
herself
from
her
long
reverie
at
last
there
was
the
sound
of
wheels
upon
the
across
the
wide
open
field
in
front
of
the
house
here
comes
whitelaw
she
said
looking
out
into
the
gathering
dusk
and
there
some
one
with
him
some
one
with
him
cried
tadman
why
my
goodness
who
can
that
be
she
ran
to
the
window
and
peered
eagerly
out
the
cart
had
driven
up
to
the
door
by
this
time
and
whitelaw
and
his
companion
were
alighting
the
stranger
was
rather
a
handsome
man
tadman
saw
at
the
first
glance
tall
and
clad
in
trousers
a
short
and
a
hat
but
with
a
certain
style
even
in
this
rough
apparel
which
was
not
the
style
of
agricultural
malsham
an
unmistakable
air
that
belongs
to
a
dweller
in
great
cities
i
never
set
eyes
upon
him
before
exclaimed
tadman
aghast
with
wonder
for
visitors
at
wyncomb
were
of
the
rarest
and
an
unknown
visitor
above
all
things
marvellous
whitelaw
opened
the
which
opened
straight
into
a
little
lobby
between
the
two
parlours
there
was
a
larger
door
and
a
spacious
stone
at
one
end
of
the
house
but
that
door
had
not
been
opened
within
the
memory
of
man
and
the
hall
was
only
used
as
a
storehouse
there
was
some
little
mumbling
talk
in
the
lobby
before
the
two
men
came
in
and
then
tadman
curiosity
was
relieved
by
a
closer
view
of
the
stranger
yes
he
was
certainly
handsome
remarkably
handsome
even
for
a
man
whose
youth
was
past
but
there
was
something
in
his
face
a
something
sinister
and
secret
as
it
were
which
did
not
strike
tadman
favourably
she
could
not
by
any
means
have
explained
the
nature
of
her
sensations
on
looking
at
him
but
as
she
said
afterwards
she
felt
all
in
a
moment
that
he
was
there
for
no
good
and
yet
he
was
very
too
and
addressed
both
the
ladies
in
a
most
conciliating
tone
and
with
a
kind
of
florid
politeness
ellen
looked
at
him
interested
for
the
moment
in
spite
of
her
apathetic
indifference
to
all
things
the
advent
of
a
stranger
was
something
so
rare
as
to
awaken
a
faint
interest
in
the
mind
most
dead
to
impressions
she
did
not
like
his
manner
there
was
something
false
and
hollow
in
his
extreme
politeness
and
his
face
what
was
it
in
his
face
that
startled
her
with
such
a
sudden
sense
of
strangeness
and
yet
of
familiarity
had
she
ever
seen
him
before
yes
surely
that
was
the
impression
which
sent
such
a
sudden
shock
through
her
nerves
which
startled
her
from
her
indifference
into
eager
wonder
and
perplexity
where
had
she
seen
him
before
where
and
when
long
ago
or
only
very
lately
she
could
not
tell
yet
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
looked
at
eyes
like
those
not
once
but
many
times
in
her
life
and
yet
the
man
was
utterly
strange
to
her
that
she
could
have
seen
him
before
appeared
impossible
it
must
have
been
some
one
like
him
she
had
seen
then
yes
that
was
it
it
was
the
shadow
of
another
face
in
his
that
had
startled
her
with
so
strange
a
feeling
almost
as
if
she
had
been
looking
upon
some
ghostly
thing
another
face
like
and
yet
unlike
but
what
face
whose
face
she
could
not
answer
that
question
and
her
inability
to
solve
the
enigma
tormented
her
all
as
the
stranger
sat
opposite
to
her
making
a
pretence
of
eating
heartily
in
accordance
with
whitelaw
hospitable
invitation
while
that
gentleman
himself
ploughed
away
with
a
steady
persistence
that
made
awful
havoc
with
the
ham
and
reduced
the
loaf
in
a
manner
suggestive
of
jack
the
the
visitor
presently
ventured
to
remark
that
was
not
much
in
his
way
and
that
if
it
were
all
the
same
to
whitelaw
he
should
prefer
a
glass
of
whereupon
the
was
produced
from
a
cupboard
by
the
of
which
stephen
himself
kept
the
key
judiciously
on
his
guard
against
a
possible
taste
for
ardent
spirits
developing
itself
in
tadman
after
this
the
stranger
sat
for
some
time
drinking
cold
and
staring
moodily
at
the
fire
without
making
the
faintest
attempt
at
conversation
while
whitelaw
finished
his
tea
and
the
table
was
cleared
and
even
after
this
when
the
farmer
had
taken
his
place
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
hearth
and
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
his
guest
to
begin
business
he
was
not
a
lively
stranger
he
seemed
indeed
to
have
something
on
his
mind
to
be
brooding
upon
some
trouble
or
difficulty
as
tadman
remarked
to
her
kinsman
wife
afterwards
both
the
women
watched
him
ellen
always
perplexed
by
that
unknown
likeness
which
seemed
sometimes
to
grow
stronger
sometimes
to
fade
away
altogether
as
she
looked
at
him
tadman
in
a
rabid
state
of
curiosity
so
profound
was
the
mystery
of
his
silent
presence
what
was
he
there
for
what
could
stephen
want
with
him
he
was
not
one
of
stephen
sort
by
any
means
had
no
appearance
of
association
with
agricultural
interests
and
yet
there
he
was
a
silent
inexplicable
presence
a
mysterious
figure
with
a
moody
brow
which
seemed
to
grow
darker
as
tadman
watched
him
at
last
about
an
hour
after
the
had
been
cleared
he
rose
suddenly
with
an
abrupt
gesture
and
said
come
whitelaw
if
you
mean
to
show
me
this
house
of
yours
you
may
as
well
show
it
to
me
at
once
his
voice
had
a
harsh
unpleasant
sound
as
he
said
this
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
women
staring
at
the
fire
while
stephen
whitelaw
lighted
a
candle
in
his
slow
dawdling
way
be
quick
man
alive
the
stranger
cried
impatiently
turning
sharply
round
upon
the
farmer
who
was
trimming
an
incorrigible
wick
with
a
pair
of
blunted
snuffers
remember
i
got
to
go
back
to
malsham
i
all
the
night
to
waste
i
do
want
to
set
my
house
afire
whitelaw
answered
sullenly
though
perhaps
might
like
that
it
might
suit
your
book
you
see
the
stranger
gave
a
sudden
shudder
and
told
the
farmer
with
an
angry
oath
to
drop
that
sort
of
insolence
and
now
show
the
way
and
look
sharp
about
it
he
said
in
an
authoritative
tone
they
went
out
of
the
room
in
the
next
moment
tadman
gazed
after
them
or
rather
at
the
door
which
had
closed
upon
them
with
a
solemn
stare
i
do
like
the
look
of
it
ellen
she
said
i
do
at
all
like
the
look
of
it
what
do
you
mean
the
girl
asked
indifferently
i
do
like
the
hold
that
man
has
got
over
stephen
nor
the
way
he
speaks
to
him
almost
as
if
steph
was
a
dog
did
you
hear
him
just
now
and
what
does
he
want
to
see
the
house
for
i
should
like
to
know
what
can
this
house
matter
to
him
unless
he
was
going
to
buy
it
that
it
perhaps
ellen
stephen
has
been
speculating
and
has
gone
and
ruined
himself
and
that
strange
man
is
going
to
buy
wyncomb
he
gave
me
a
kind
of
turn
the
minute
i
looked
at
him
and
depend
upon
it
he
come
to
turn
us
all
out
of
house
and
home
ellen
gave
a
faint
shudder
what
if
her
father
wicked
scheming
were
to
come
to
such
an
end
as
this
what
if
she
had
been
sold
into
bondage
and
the
master
to
whom
she
had
been
given
had
not
even
the
wealth
which
had
been
held
before
her
as
a
bait
in
her
misery
for
herself
she
cared
little
whether
she
were
rich
or
poor
it
could
make
but
a
difference
of
detail
in
the
fact
of
her
unhappiness
whether
she
were
mistress
of
wyncomb
or
a
homeless
tramp
upon
the
country
roads
the
workhouse
without
stephen
whitelaw
must
needs
be
infinitely
preferable
to
wyncomb
farm
with
him
and
for
her
father
it
seemed
only
a
natural
and
justifiable
thing
that
his
guilt
and
his
greed
should
be
so
punished
he
had
sold
his
daughter
into
slavery
for
nothing
but
that
one
advance
of
two
hundred
pounds
he
had
saved
himself
from
the
penalty
of
his
dishonesty
however
by
that
sacrifice
and
would
no
doubt
hold
his
misery
lightly
enough
even
if
poverty
were
added
to
the
wretchedness
of
her
position
the
two
women
sat
down
on
opposite
sides
of
the
hearth
tadman
too
anxious
to
go
on
with
her
accustomed
knitting
only
able
to
wring
her
hands
in
a
feeble
way
and
groan
every
now
and
then
or
from
time
to
time
burst
into
some
fragmentary
speech
and
stephen
just
the
man
to
have
such
a
thing
on
his
mind
and
keep
it
from
everybody
till
the
last
moment
she
cried
piteously
and
so
many
speculations
as
there
are
to
tempt
a
man
to
his
ruin
railways
and
mines
and
loans
to
turks
and
red
indians
and
foreigners
and
steph
might
so
easy
be
tempted
by
the
hope
of
larger
profits
than
he
can
make
by
farming
but
it
no
use
torturing
yourself
like
that
with
fears
that
may
be
quite
groundless
ellen
said
at
last
rousing
herself
a
little
in
order
to
put
a
stop
to
the
wailing
and
lamentations
of
her
companion
no
use
in
anticipating
trouble
there
may
be
nothing
in
this
business
after
all
whitelaw
may
have
a
fancy
for
showing
people
his
house
he
wanted
me
to
see
it
if
you
remember
that
afternoon
yes
but
that
was
different
he
meant
to
marry
you
why
should
he
want
to
show
the
place
to
a
stranger
i
ca
believe
but
what
that
strange
man
is
here
for
something
and
something
bad
i
saw
it
in
his
face
when
he
first
came
in
it
was
useless
arguing
the
matter
tadman
was
evidently
not
to
be
shaken
so
ellen
said
no
more
and
they
sat
on
in
silence
each
occupied
with
her
own
thoughts
ellen
were
not
about
stephen
whitelaw
financial
condition
but
they
were
very
sad
ones
she
had
received
a
letter
from
frank
randall
since
her
marriage
a
most
bitter
letter
upbraiding
her
for
her
falsehood
and
desertion
and
accusing
her
of
being
actuated
by
mercenary
motives
in
her
marriage
with
stephen
whitelaw
how
often
have
i
heard
you
express
your
detestation
of
that
fellow
the
young
man
wrote
indignantly
how
often
have
i
heard
you
declare
that
no
earthly
persuasion
should
ever
induce
you
to
marry
him
and
yet
before
my
back
has
been
turned
six
months
i
hear
that
you
are
his
wife
without
a
word
of
warning
without
a
line
of
explanation
to
soften
the
blow
if
anything
could
soften
it
the
news
comes
to
me
from
a
stranger
who
knew
nothing
of
my
love
for
you
it
is
very
hard
ellen
all
the
harder
because
i
had
so
fully
trusted
in
your
fidelity
i
will
own
that
the
prospect
i
had
to
offer
you
was
a
poor
one
involving
long
delay
before
i
could
give
you
such
a
home
as
i
wanted
to
give
you
but
o
nelly
nelly
i
felt
so
sure
that
you
would
be
true
to
me
and
if
you
found
yourself
in
any
difficulty
worried
beyond
your
power
of
resistance
by
your
father
though
i
did
not
think
you
were
the
kind
of
girl
to
yield
weakly
to
persuasion
a
line
from
you
would
have
brought
me
to
your
side
ready
to
defend
you
from
any
persecution
and
only
too
proud
to
claim
you
for
my
wife
and
carry
you
away
from
your
father
unkindness
the
letter
went
on
for
some
time
in
the
same
upbraiding
strain
ellen
shed
many
bitter
tears
over
it
in
the
quiet
of
her
own
room
it
had
been
delivered
to
her
secretly
by
her
old
friend
sarah
peters
the
daughter
who
had
been
the
confidante
of
her
love
affairs
for
even
in
his
indignation
randall
had
been
prudent
enough
to
consider
that
such
a
missive
falling
perchance
into
stephen
whitelaw
hands
might
work
serious
mischief
cruel
as
the
letter
was
ellen
could
not
leave
it
quite
unanswered
some
word
in
her
own
defence
she
must
needs
write
but
her
reply
was
of
the
briefest
there
are
some
things
that
can
never
be
explained
she
wrote
and
my
marriage
is
one
of
those
no
one
could
save
me
from
it
you
least
of
all
there
was
no
help
for
me
and
i
believe
with
all
my
heart
that
in
acting
as
i
did
i
only
did
my
duty
i
had
not
the
courage
to
write
to
you
beforehand
to
tell
you
what
was
going
to
be
i
thought
it
was
almost
better
you
should
hear
it
from
a
stranger
the
more
hardly
you
think
of
me
the
easier
it
will
be
for
you
to
forget
me
there
is
some
comfort
in
that
i
daresay
it
will
be
very
easy
for
you
to
forget
but
if
in
days
to
come
when
you
are
happily
married
to
some
one
else
you
can
teach
yourself
to
think
more
kindly
of
me
and
to
believe
that
in
what
i
did
i
acted
for
the
best
you
will
be
performing
an
act
of
charity
towards
a
poor
unhappy
girl
who
has
very
little
left
to
hope
for
in
this
world
it
was
a
hard
thing
for
ellen
to
think
that
in
the
estimation
of
the
man
she
loved
she
must
for
ever
seem
the
basest
and
most
mercenary
of
womankind
and
yet
how
poor
an
excuse
could
she
offer
in
the
vague
pleading
of
her
letter
she
could
not
so
much
as
hint
at
the
truth
she
could
not
blacken
her
father
character
that
frank
randall
should
despise
her
only
made
her
trial
a
little
sharper
her
daily
burden
a
little
heavier
she
told
herself
with
her
mind
full
of
these
thoughts
she
had
very
little
sympathy
to
bestow
upon
tadman
whose
fragmentary
lamentations
only
worried
her
like
the
murmurs
of
some
troublesome
child
whereby
that
doleful
person
finding
her
soul
growing
heavier
and
heavier
for
lack
of
counsel
or
consolation
could
at
last
endure
this
state
of
suspense
no
longer
in
sheer
inactivity
but
was
fain
to
bestir
herself
somehow
if
even
in
the
most
useless
manner
she
got
up
from
her
seat
therefore
went
over
to
the
door
and
softly
opening
it
peered
out
into
the
darkness
beyond
there
was
nothing
no
glimmer
of
stephen
candle
no
sound
of
footsteps
or
of
men
voices
the
merest
blankness
and
no
more
the
two
men
had
been
away
from
the
parlour
something
more
than
half
an
hour
by
this
time
for
about
five
minutes
tadman
stood
at
the
open
door
peering
out
and
listening
and
still
without
result
then
with
a
shrill
sudden
sound
through
the
long
empty
passages
there
came
a
shriek
a
prolonged
piercing
cry
of
terror
or
of
pain
which
turned
tadman
blood
to
ice
and
brought
ellen
to
her
side
pale
and
breathless
what
was
that
what
was
that
both
uttered
the
same
question
simultaneously
looking
at
each
other
aghast
and
then
both
fled
in
the
direction
from
which
that
shrill
cry
had
come
a
woman
voice
surely
no
masculine
cry
ever
sounded
with
such
piercing
treble
they
hurried
off
to
discover
the
meaning
of
this
startling
sound
but
were
neither
of
them
very
clear
as
to
whence
it
had
come
from
the
upper
story
no
doubt
but
in
that
rambling
habitation
there
was
so
much
scope
for
uncertainty
they
ran
together
up
the
staircase
most
used
to
the
corridor
from
which
the
principal
rooms
opened
before
they
could
reach
the
top
of
the
stairs
they
heard
a
scuffling
hurrying
sound
of
heavy
footsteps
on
the
floor
above
them
and
on
the
landing
met
whitelaw
and
his
unknown
friend
face
to
face
what
the
matter
asked
the
farmer
sharply
looking
angrily
at
the
two
scared
faces
that
just
what
we
want
to
know
his
wife
answered
who
was
it
that
screamed
just
now
who
been
hurt
my
friend
stumbled
against
a
step
in
the
passage
yonder
and
knocked
his
shin
he
cried
out
a
bit
louder
than
he
need
have
done
if
that
what
you
mean
but
not
loud
enough
to
cause
all
this
fuss
get
downstairs
again
you
two
and
keep
quiet
i
no
patience
with
such
nonsense
coming
flying
upstairs
as
if
you
both
gone
mad
it
was
not
your
friend
voice
we
heard
ellen
answered
resolutely
it
was
a
woman
cry
you
must
have
heard
it
surely
stephen
whitelaw
i
heard
nothing
but
what
i
tell
you
the
farmer
muttered
sulkily
get
downstairs
ca
you
not
till
i
know
what
the
matter
his
wife
said
undismayed
by
his
anger
give
me
your
light
and
let
me
go
and
see
you
can
go
where
you
like
wench
and
see
what
you
can
and
an
uncommon
deal
wiser
you
be
for
your
trouble
and
yet
although
whitelaw
gave
his
wife
the
candlestick
with
an
air
of
profound
indifference
there
was
an
uneasy
look
in
his
countenance
which
she
could
plainly
see
and
which
perplexed
her
not
a
little
come
tadman
she
said
decisively
we
had
better
see
into
this
it
was
a
woman
voice
and
must
have
been
one
of
the
girls
i
suppose
it
may
be
nothing
serious
after
all
these
country
girls
scream
out
for
a
very
little
but
we
better
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
whitelaw
burst
into
a
laugh
and
he
was
a
man
whose
laughter
was
as
unpleasant
as
it
was
rare
ay
my
wench
you
best
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
he
said
since
you
so
uncommon
clever
me
and
my
friend
will
go
back
to
the
parlour
and
take
a
glass
of
grog
the
gentleman
whom
whitelaw
honoured
with
his
friendship
had
stood
a
little
way
apart
all
this
time
wiping
his
forehead
with
a
big
orange
coloured
silk
handkerchief
that
blow
upon
his
shin
must
have
been
rather
a
sharp
one
if
it
had
brought
that
cold
sweat
out
upon
his
ashen
face
yes
he
muttered
come
along
ca
you
do
stand
cawing
here
all
night
and
hurried
downstairs
before
his
host
it
had
been
all
the
business
of
a
couple
of
minutes
ellen
whitelaw
and
tadman
went
down
to
the
ground
floor
by
another
staircase
leading
directly
to
the
kitchen
the
room
looked
comfortable
enough
and
the
two
were
sitting
at
a
table
near
the
fire
one
was
a
strapping
country
girl
who
did
all
the
household
work
the
other
an
overgrown
girl
hired
straight
from
the
workhouse
by
whitelaw
from
economical
motives
a
girl
whose
intellect
was
of
the
lowest
order
a
mere
zoophyte
girl
one
would
say
something
between
the
vegetable
and
animal
creation
this
one
whose
name
was
sarah
batts
was
chiefly
employed
in
the
and
dairy
she
had
a
broad
brawny
hand
which
was
useful
for
the
milking
of
cows
and
showed
some
kind
of
intelligence
in
the
management
of
young
chickens
and
the
treatment
of
refractory
hens
martha
holden
the
was
busy
making
herself
a
cap
as
her
mistress
came
into
the
kitchen
droning
some
hampshire
ballad
by
way
of
accompaniment
to
her
work
sarah
batts
was
seated
in
an
attitude
of
luxurious
repose
with
her
arms
folded
and
her
feet
on
the
fender
was
it
either
of
you
girls
that
screamed
just
now
ellen
asked
anxiously
screamed
no
indeed
martha
holden
answered
with
an
air
of
perfect
good
faith
what
should
we
scream
for
i
been
sitting
here
at
my
work
for
the
last
hour
as
quiet
as
could
be
and
sarah
was
it
you
sarah
for
goodness
sake
tell
the
truth
me
mum
lor
no
mum
i
was
up
with
master
showing
him
and
the
strange
gentleman
a
light
you
were
upstairs
with
your
master
and
did
you
hear
nothing
a
piercing
shriek
that
rang
through
the
house
you
must
surely
have
heard
it
both
of
you
martha
shook
her
head
resolutely
not
me
mum
i
did
hear
a
sound
the
was
shut
all
the
time
sarah
was
away
and
i
was
busy
at
work
and
thinking
of
nothing
but
my
work
i
was
upon
the
listen
as
you
may
say
the
kitchen
was
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
house
remote
from
that
direction
whence
the
unexplainable
cry
seemed
to
have
come
it
is
most
extraordinary
ellen
said
gravely
perplexed
beyond
all
measure
but
you
sarah
if
you
were
upstairs
with
your
master
you
must
surely
have
heard
that
shriek
it
seemed
to
come
from
upstairs
did
master
hear
it
asked
the
girl
deliberately
he
says
not
then
how
should
i
mum
no
mum
i
did
hear
nothink
i
can
take
my
bible
oath
of
that
i
do
want
any
oaths
i
only
want
to
know
the
meaning
of
this
business
there
would
have
been
no
harm
in
your
screaming
you
might
just
as
well
speak
the
truth
about
it
lor
mum
but
it
war
me
answered
sarah
batts
with
an
injured
look
whatever
could
go
to
put
it
in
your
head
as
it
was
me
it
must
have
been
one
or
other
of
you
two
girls
there
no
other
woman
in
the
house
and
as
you
were
upstairs
it
seems
more
likely
to
have
been
you
however
there
no
use
talking
any
more
about
it
only
we
both
heard
the
scream
did
we
mrs
tadman
i
should
think
we
did
indeed
responded
the
widow
with
a
vehement
shudder
my
flesh
is
all
upon
the
creep
at
this
very
moment
i
think
i
ever
had
such
a
turn
in
my
life
they
went
back
to
the
parlour
leaving
the
two
servants
still
sitting
by
the
fire
sarah
batts
with
that
look
of
injured
innocence
fixed
upon
her
wooden
countenance
martha
holden
cheerfully
employed
in
the
construction
of
her
sunday
cap
in
the
parlour
the
two
men
were
both
standing
by
the
table
the
stranger
with
his
back
to
the
women
as
they
entered
stephen
whitelaw
facing
him
the
former
seemed
to
have
been
counting
something
but
stopped
abruptly
as
the
women
came
into
the
room
there
was
a
little
heap
of
lying
on
the
table
stephen
snatched
them
up
hastily
and
thrust
them
in
a
bundle
into
his
while
the
stranger
put
a
strap
round
a
bulky
red
morocco
with
a
more
deliberate
air
as
of
one
who
had
nothing
to
hide
from
the
world
that
guilty
furtive
air
of
stephen
and
above
all
that
passage
of
money
between
the
two
men
confirmed
tadman
in
her
notion
that
wyncomb
farm
was
going
to
change
hands
she
resumed
her
seat
by
the
fire
with
a
groan
and
accepted
ellen
offer
of
a
glass
of
with
a
doleful
shake
of
her
head
did
i
tell
you
so
she
whispered
as
whitelaw
handed
her
the
comforting
beverage
the
stranger
was
evidently
on
the
point
of
departure
there
was
a
sound
of
wheels
on
the
gravel
outside
the
parlour
window
the
familiar
sound
of
stephen
whitelaw
and
that
gentleman
was
busy
helping
his
visitor
on
with
his
i
shall
be
late
for
the
last
train
said
the
stranger
unless
your
man
drives
like
the
very
devil
he
drive
fast
enough
i
daresay
if
you
give
him
whitelaw
answered
with
a
grin
but
do
let
him
go
and
do
my
horse
any
damage
or
you
have
to
pay
for
it
of
course
you
like
to
get
the
price
of
a
decent
animal
out
of
me
for
that
brute
of
yours
replied
the
stranger
with
a
scornful
laugh
i
think
there
never
was
such
a
grinding
grasping
beggar
since
the
world
began
however
you
seen
the
last
shilling
you
ever
likely
to
get
out
of
me
so
make
the
best
of
it
and
remember
wherever
i
may
be
there
are
friends
of
mine
in
this
country
who
will
keep
a
sharp
upon
you
and
let
me
know
precious
quick
if
you
do
stick
to
your
part
of
our
bargain
like
an
honest
man
or
as
nearly
like
one
as
nature
will
allow
you
to
come
and
now
mr
ladies
your
humble
servant
he
was
gone
before
ellen
or
tadman
could
reply
to
his
parting
salutation
had
they
been
disposed
to
do
so
whitelaw
went
out
with
him
and
gave
some
final
directions
to
the
who
was
to
drive
the
and
presently
came
back
to
the
parlour
looking
considerably
relieved
by
his
guest
departure
tadman
rushed
at
once
to
the
expression
of
her
fears
stephen
whitelaw
she
exclaimed
solemnly
tell
us
the
worst
at
once
it
no
good
keeping
things
back
from
us
that
man
has
come
here
to
turn
us
out
of
house
and
home
you
sold
wyncomb
sold
wyncomb
have
you
gone
crazy
you
old
fool
cried
whitelaw
contemplating
his
kinswoman
with
a
most
evil
expression
of
countenance
what
put
that
stuff
in
your
head
your
own
doings
stephen
and
that
man
what
does
he
come
here
for
with
his
masterful
ways
unless
it
to
turn
us
out
of
house
and
home
what
did
you
show
him
the
house
for
nigh
upon
an
hour
you
were
out
of
this
room
with
him
if
you
were
a
minute
why
did
money
pass
from
him
to
you
i
saw
you
put
it
in
your
pocket
a
bundle
of
you
a
prying
old
catemeran
cried
whitelaw
savagely
and
a
drunken
old
fool
into
the
why
do
you
let
her
muddle
herself
with
the
like
that
ellen
you
ought
to
have
more
respect
for
my
property
you
do
call
that
taking
care
of
your
husband
as
for
you
mother
tadman
if
you
treat
me
to
any
more
of
this
nonsense
you
will
find
yourself
turned
out
of
house
and
home
a
precious
deal
sooner
than
you
bargained
for
but
it
wo
be
because
of
my
selling
wyncomb
sell
wyncomb
indeed
i
about
as
much
thought
of
going
up
in
a
balloon
as
of
parting
with
a
rood
or
a
perch
of
my
father
land
this
was
a
very
long
speech
for
whitelaw
and
having
finished
it
he
sank
into
his
chair
quite
exhausted
by
the
unusual
effort
and
refreshed
himself
with
copious
libations
of
what
was
that
man
here
for
then
stephen
it
only
natural
i
should
want
to
know
that
said
tadman
abashed
but
not
struck
dumb
by
her
kinsman
reproof
what
that
to
you
business
yes
there
been
money
pass
between
us
and
it
rather
a
profitable
business
for
me
perhaps
it
was
perhaps
it
was
that
about
all
you
any
call
to
know
i
made
money
by
it
and
not
lost
and
now
do
let
me
be
bothered
about
it
any
more
if
you
and
me
are
to
keep
friends
i
sure
stephen
tadman
remonstrated
in
a
feebly
plaintive
tone
i
no
wish
to
bother
you
there
nothing
farther
from
my
thoughts
but
it
only
natural
that
i
should
be
anxious
about
a
place
where
lived
so
many
years
not
but
what
i
could
get
my
living
easy
enough
elsewhere
as
you
must
know
stephen
being
able
to
turn
my
hand
to
almost
anything
to
this
feeble
protest
whitelaw
vouchsafed
no
answer
he
had
lighted
his
pipe
by
this
time
and
was
smoking
and
staring
at
the
fire
with
his
usual
stolid
air
meditative
it
might
be
or
only
ruminant
like
one
of
his
own
cattle
but
all
through
that
night
whitelaw
who
was
not
commonly
a
seer
of
visions
or
dreamer
of
dreams
had
his
slumbers
disturbed
by
some
unwonted
perplexity
of
spirit
his
wife
lay
broad
awake
thinking
of
that
prolonged
and
piercing
cry
which
seemed
to
her
the
more
she
meditated
upon
it
in
have
been
a
cry
of
anguish
or
of
terror
and
could
not
fail
to
notice
this
unusual
disturbance
of
her
husband
sleep
more
than
once
he
muttered
to
himself
in
a
troubled
manner
but
his
words
for
the
most
part
were
incoherent
and
disjointed
words
of
which
that
perplexed
listener
could
make
nothing
once
she
heard
him
say
a
bad
job
dangerous
business
chapter
xl
in
pursuit
john
saltram
improved
daily
at
hampton
court
in
spite
of
his
fierce
impatience
to
get
well
in
order
to
engage
in
the
search
for
marian
an
impatience
which
was
in
itself
sufficient
to
militate
against
his
he
did
make
considerable
progress
on
the
road
to
recovery
he
was
still
very
weak
and
it
must
take
time
to
complete
his
restoration
but
he
was
no
longer
the
pale
ghost
of
his
former
self
that
gilbert
had
brought
down
to
the
quiet
suburb
it
would
have
been
a
cruel
thing
to
leave
him
much
alone
at
such
a
time
or
it
would
have
seemed
very
cruel
to
gilbert
fenton
who
had
ever
present
in
his
memory
those
old
days
in
egypt
when
this
man
had
stood
him
in
such
good
stead
he
remembered
the
days
of
his
own
sickness
and
contrived
to
perform
his
business
duties
within
the
smallest
time
possible
and
so
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
in
the
comfortable
looking
out
upon
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
upon
the
pretty
high
road
before
the
palace
grounds
nor
was
there
any
sign
in
the
intercourse
of
those
two
that
the
bond
of
friendship
between
them
was
broken
there
was
it
is
true
a
something
deprecating
in
john
saltram
manner
that
had
not
been
common
to
him
of
old
and
in
gilbert
fenton
a
deeper
gravity
than
was
quite
natural
but
that
was
all
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
any
latent
spirit
of
animosity
could
lurk
in
the
mind
of
either
in
sober
truth
gilbert
in
his
heart
of
hearts
had
forgiven
his
treacherous
friend
again
and
again
he
had
told
himself
that
the
wrong
he
had
suffered
was
an
unpardonable
offence
a
thing
not
to
be
forgiven
upon
any
ground
whatever
but
lo
when
he
looked
into
his
mind
to
discover
the
smouldering
fires
of
that
burning
anger
which
he
had
felt
at
first
against
the
traitor
he
could
find
nothing
but
the
gray
ashes
of
a
flame
the
wrong
had
been
suffered
and
he
loved
his
old
friend
still
yes
there
was
that
in
his
heart
for
john
saltram
which
no
could
blot
out
so
he
tended
the
convalescent
couch
with
a
quiet
devotion
that
touched
the
sinner
very
deeply
and
there
was
a
peace
between
those
two
which
had
in
it
something
almost
sacred
in
the
mind
of
the
one
there
was
a
remorseful
sense
of
guilt
in
the
heart
of
the
other
a
pitying
tenderness
too
deep
for
words
one
night
as
they
were
together
on
opposite
sides
of
the
fire
john
saltram
lying
on
a
low
sofa
drawn
close
to
the
hearth
gilbert
seated
lazily
in
an
the
invalid
broke
out
suddenly
into
a
kind
of
apology
for
his
the
conversation
had
flagged
between
them
after
the
had
been
removed
by
the
brisk
little
of
the
lodgings
gilbert
gazing
meditatively
at
the
fire
john
saltram
so
quiet
that
his
companion
had
thought
him
asleep
i
said
once
that
i
would
tell
you
all
about
that
business
he
began
at
last
in
a
sudden
spasmodic
way
but
after
all
there
is
so
little
to
tell
there
is
no
excuse
for
what
i
did
i
know
that
better
than
you
can
know
it
a
man
in
my
position
who
had
a
spark
of
generosity
or
honour
would
have
strangled
his
miserable
passion
in
its
birth
would
have
gone
away
directly
he
discovered
his
folly
and
never
looked
upon
marian
nowell
face
again
i
did
try
to
do
that
gilbert
you
remember
that
last
night
we
ever
spent
together
at
lidford
what
a
night
it
was
only
a
with
a
girl
bright
face
shining
in
the
lamplight
and
a
man
over
head
and
ears
in
love
but
a
glimpse
of
paradise
to
that
man
i
meant
that
it
should
be
the
last
of
my
weakness
gilbert
i
had
pledged
myself
to
that
by
all
the
outspoken
oaths
wherewith
a
man
can
bind
himself
to
do
his
duty
and
i
did
turn
my
back
upon
the
scene
of
my
temptation
as
you
know
heartily
resolved
never
to
approach
the
edge
of
the
pit
again
i
think
if
you
had
stayed
in
england
gilbert
if
you
had
been
on
the
spot
to
defend
your
own
rights
all
would
have
gone
well
i
should
have
kept
the
promise
i
had
made
for
myself
it
was
so
much
the
more
sacred
because
of
my
absence
john
gilbert
said
perhaps
after
all
i
suppose
it
was
only
a
question
of
opportunity
that
particular
devil
who
tempts
men
to
their
dishonour
contrived
that
the
business
should
be
made
fatally
easy
for
me
you
were
away
and
the
coast
was
clear
you
know
i
loved
you
gilbert
but
there
is
a
passion
stronger
than
the
love
which
a
man
feels
for
his
dearest
friend
i
meant
most
steadfastly
to
keep
my
faith
with
you
but
you
were
away
and
that
fellow
forster
plagued
me
to
come
to
him
i
refused
at
first
yes
i
held
out
for
a
couple
of
months
but
the
fever
was
strong
upon
me
a
restless
demon
not
to
be
exorcised
by
hard
work
or
dissipation
even
for
i
tried
both
and
then
before
you
were
at
the
end
of
your
journey
while
you
were
still
a
wanderer
across
the
desolate
sea
happy
in
the
thought
of
your
dear
love
fidelity
my
courage
gave
way
all
at
once
and
i
went
down
to
heatherly
and
so
i
saw
her
and
saw
that
she
loved
me
all
unworthy
as
i
was
and
from
that
hour
i
was
a
lost
man
i
thought
of
nothing
but
winning
her
if
you
had
only
been
true
to
me
even
then
john
if
you
had
written
to
me
declaring
the
truth
and
giving
me
fair
warning
that
you
were
my
rival
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
think
what
a
torture
of
suspense
what
a
world
of
wasted
anger
you
might
have
saved
me
yes
it
would
have
been
the
manlier
course
no
doubt
the
other
answered
but
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
that
i
could
not
face
the
idea
of
your
justifiable
wrath
i
wanted
to
win
my
wife
and
keep
my
friend
it
was
altogether
a
weak
notion
that
idea
of
secrecy
of
course
and
could
hold
water
for
any
time
as
the
result
has
shown
but
i
thought
you
would
get
over
your
disappointment
quickly
those
wounds
are
apt
to
heal
so
speedily
and
fall
in
love
elsewhere
and
then
it
would
have
been
easy
for
me
to
tell
you
the
truth
so
i
persuaded
my
dear
love
who
was
easily
induced
to
do
anything
i
wished
to
consent
to
our
secret
being
kept
from
you
religiously
for
the
time
being
and
to
that
end
we
were
married
under
a
false
name
not
exactly
a
false
name
either
you
remember
my
asking
you
if
you
had
ever
heard
the
name
of
holbrook
before
your
hunt
after
marian
husband
you
said
no
yet
i
think
you
must
have
seen
the
name
in
some
of
my
old
college
books
i
was
christened
john
holbrook
my
grandmother
was
one
of
the
holbrooks
of
sussex
people
of
some
importance
in
their
day
and
our
family
were
rather
proud
of
the
name
but
i
have
dropped
it
ever
since
i
was
a
lad
no
i
do
think
i
can
ever
have
seen
the
name
i
must
surely
have
remembered
it
if
i
had
seen
it
perhaps
so
well
gilbert
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
i
loved
her
selfishly
after
the
manner
of
mankind
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
give
her
up
and
pursued
her
with
a
passionate
persistence
which
must
plead
excuse
if
her
uncle
had
lived
i
doubt
whether
i
should
ever
have
succeeded
but
his
death
left
the
tender
womanly
heart
weakened
by
sorrow
and
so
i
won
her
the
dearest
truest
wife
that
ever
man
was
blest
withal
yet
i
confess
to
you
so
wayward
is
my
nature
that
there
have
been
moments
in
which
i
repented
my
triumph
weak
hours
of
doubt
and
foreboding
in
which
i
fear
that
dear
girl
divined
my
thoughts
since
our
wretched
separation
i
have
fancied
sometimes
that
a
conviction
of
this
kind
on
her
part
is
at
the
root
of
the
business
that
she
has
alienated
herself
from
me
believing
in
plain
words
that
i
was
tired
of
her
such
an
idea
as
that
would
scarcely
agree
with
ellen
carley
account
of
marian
state
of
mind
during
that
last
day
or
two
at
the
grange
she
was
eagerly
expecting
your
return
looking
forward
with
delight
to
the
pleasant
surprise
you
were
to
experience
when
you
heard
of
jacob
will
yes
the
girl
told
me
that
great
heavens
why
did
i
not
return
a
few
days
earlier
i
was
waiting
for
money
not
caring
to
go
back
writing
and
working
like
a
nigger
i
dared
not
meet
my
poor
girl
at
her
grandfather
since
in
so
doing
i
must
risk
an
encounter
with
you
after
this
they
talked
of
marian
disappearance
for
some
time
going
over
the
same
ground
very
often
in
their
helplessness
and
able
at
last
to
arrive
at
no
satisfactory
conclusion
if
she
were
with
her
father
she
was
with
a
bad
unscrupulous
man
that
was
a
fact
which
gilbert
fenton
no
longer
pretended
to
deny
they
sat
talking
till
late
and
parted
for
the
night
in
very
different
spirits
gilbert
had
a
good
deal
of
hard
work
in
the
city
on
the
following
day
a
batch
of
foreign
correspondence
too
important
to
be
entrusted
to
a
clerk
and
two
or
three
rather
particular
interviews
all
this
occupied
him
up
to
so
late
an
hour
that
he
was
obliged
to
sleep
in
london
that
night
and
to
defer
his
return
to
hampton
till
the
next
day
business
was
over
this
time
he
got
over
his
work
by
an
early
hour
and
was
able
to
catch
a
train
that
left
waterloo
at
five
he
felt
a
little
uneasy
at
having
been
away
from
the
convalescent
so
long
though
he
knew
that
john
saltram
was
now
strong
enough
to
get
on
tolerably
without
him
and
that
the
people
of
the
house
were
careful
and
kindly
ready
at
any
moment
to
give
assistance
if
it
were
wanted
strange
he
thought
to
himself
as
the
train
approached
the
quiet
village
strange
that
i
should
be
so
fond
of
the
fellow
in
spite
of
all
that
i
should
care
more
for
his
society
than
that
of
any
man
living
it
is
the
mere
force
of
habit
i
suppose
after
all
these
years
of
liking
the
link
between
us
is
not
to
be
broken
even
by
the
deepest
wrong
that
one
man
can
do
another
the
spring
twilight
was
closing
in
as
he
crossed
the
bridge
and
walked
briskly
along
an
avenue
of
leafless
trees
at
the
side
of
the
green
the
place
had
a
peaceful
rustic
look
at
this
dusky
hour
there
were
no
traces
of
that
modern
spoiler
the
speculative
builder
just
hereabouts
and
the
quaint
old
houses
near
the
barracks
where
lights
were
twinkling
feebly
here
and
there
had
a
look
of
days
that
are
gone
a
touch
of
that
plaintive
poetry
which
pervades
all
relics
of
the
past
gilbert
felt
the
charm
of
the
hour
the
air
still
and
mild
the
silence
only
broken
by
the
cawing
of
palatial
rooks
and
whatever
tenderness
towards
john
saltram
there
was
lurking
in
his
breast
seemed
to
grow
upon
him
as
he
drew
nearer
to
their
lodgings
so
that
his
mood
was
of
the
softest
when
he
opened
the
little
and
went
in
i
will
make
no
further
pretence
of
enmity
he
said
to
himself
i
will
not
keep
up
this
farce
of
estrangement
we
two
will
be
friends
once
more
life
is
not
long
enough
for
the
rupture
of
such
a
friendship
there
was
no
light
shining
in
the
parlour
window
no
pleasant
streaming
out
upon
the
night
the
blank
created
by
this
unwonted
darkness
chilled
him
somehow
and
there
was
a
vague
sense
of
dread
in
his
mind
as
he
opened
the
door
there
was
no
need
to
knock
the
simple
household
was
untroubled
by
the
fear
of
intruders
and
the
door
was
rarely
fastened
until
after
dark
gilbert
went
into
the
parlour
all
was
dark
and
silent
in
the
two
rooms
which
communicated
with
folding
doors
and
made
one
apartment
there
were
no
preparations
for
dinner
he
could
see
that
in
the
deepening
dusk
the
fire
had
been
evidently
neglected
and
was
at
an
expiring
point
john
he
called
stirring
the
fire
with
a
vigorous
hand
whereby
he
gave
it
the
and
the
last
glimmer
sank
to
darkness
john
what
are
you
doing
he
fancied
the
convalescent
had
fallen
asleep
upon
the
sofa
in
the
inner
room
but
when
he
went
in
search
of
him
he
found
nothing
but
emptiness
he
rang
the
bell
violently
and
the
brisk
came
flying
in
oh
dear
sir
you
did
give
me
and
missus
such
a
turn
she
said
gasping
with
her
hand
on
her
heart
as
if
that
organ
had
been
seriously
affected
we
never
heard
you
come
in
and
when
the
bell
rung
is
saltram
worse
gilbert
asked
eagerly
worse
poor
dear
gentleman
no
sir
i
should
hope
not
though
he
well
may
be
for
there
never
was
any
one
so
imprudent
not
of
all
the
invalids
i
ever
had
to
do
with
and
hampton
is
a
rare
place
for
invalids
and
i
feel
sure
if
you
been
here
sir
you
would
have
let
him
do
it
let
him
do
what
are
you
crazy
girl
what
in
heaven
name
are
you
talking
of
you
would
have
let
him
start
off
to
london
as
he
did
yesterday
afternoon
and
scarcely
able
to
stand
alone
in
a
manner
of
speaking
gone
to
london
do
you
mean
to
say
that
my
friend
saltram
went
to
london
yes
sir
yesterday
afternoon
between
four
and
five
what
utter
madness
and
when
did
he
come
back
lor
bless
you
sir
he
ai
come
back
yet
he
told
missus
as
his
coming
back
was
quite
uncertain
and
she
was
not
to
worry
herself
about
him
she
did
all
she
could
almost
to
going
down
on
her
knees
to
hinder
him
going
but
it
was
no
use
it
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
as
he
was
going
upon
he
said
and
that
there
was
no
power
on
earth
could
keep
him
back
not
if
he
was
ten
times
worse
than
he
was
the
strange
gentleman
had
been
in
the
house
much
above
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
they
was
both
off
together
in
a
fly
to
the
station
what
strange
gentleman
a
stout
man
sir
with
gray
whiskers
that
came
from
london
and
asked
for
you
first
and
then
for
saltram
and
those
two
been
together
more
than
five
minutes
when
saltram
rang
the
bell
in
a
violent
hurry
and
told
my
missus
he
was
going
to
town
immediate
on
most
particular
business
and
would
she
pack
him
a
with
a
couple
of
shirts
and
so
on
and
then
she
tried
all
she
could
to
turn
him
from
going
but
it
was
no
good
as
i
was
telling
you
sir
just
now
go
he
would
and
go
he
did
looking
quite
flushed
and
when
he
went
out
so
as
you
have
scarcely
known
how
ill
he
been
and
he
left
a
bit
of
a
note
for
you
on
the
sir
gilbert
found
the
note
a
hurried
scrawl
upon
half
a
sheet
of
paper
twisted
up
hastily
and
unsealed
she
is
found
gilbert
wrote
john
saltram
proul
has
traced
the
father
to
his
lair
at
last
and
my
darling
is
with
him
they
are
lodging
at
i
am
off
this
instant
do
be
angry
with
me
true
and
faithful
friend
i
could
not
rest
an
hour
away
from
her
now
that
she
is
found
i
have
no
plan
of
action
but
leave
all
to
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
you
can
follow
me
whenever
you
please
marian
must
thank
you
for
your
goodness
to
me
marian
must
persuade
you
to
forgive
my
sin
against
you
ever
yours
follow
him
yes
of
course
gilbert
had
no
other
thought
and
she
was
found
at
last
after
all
their
suspense
their
torturing
anxiety
she
was
found
and
whatever
danger
there
might
be
in
her
association
with
percival
nowell
she
was
safe
so
far
and
would
be
speedily
extricated
from
the
perilous
alliance
by
her
husband
it
seemed
at
first
so
happy
a
thing
that
gilbert
could
scarcely
realise
it
and
yet
throughout
the
weary
interval
of
ignorance
as
to
her
fate
he
had
always
declared
his
belief
in
her
safety
had
he
been
really
as
confident
as
he
had
seemed
as
the
days
had
gone
by
one
after
another
without
bringing
him
any
tidings
of
her
had
there
been
no
shapeless
terror
in
his
mind
no
dark
dread
that
when
the
knowledge
came
it
might
be
something
worse
than
ignorance
yes
now
in
the
sudden
fulness
of
his
joy
he
knew
how
much
he
had
feared
how
very
near
he
had
been
to
despair
but
john
saltram
what
of
him
was
it
not
at
the
hazard
of
his
life
that
he
had
gone
upon
this
sudden
journey
reckless
and
excited
in
a
fever
of
hope
and
delight
providence
will
surely
be
good
to
him
gilbert
thought
he
bore
the
journey
from
town
when
he
was
much
worse
than
he
is
now
surely
he
will
bear
a
somewhat
rougher
journey
now
buoyed
up
by
hope
the
landlady
came
in
presently
and
insisted
upon
giving
fenton
her
own
version
of
the
story
which
he
had
just
heard
from
her
maid
and
a
very
close
and
elaborate
version
it
was
though
not
remarkable
for
any
new
facts
he
was
fain
to
listen
to
it
with
a
show
of
patience
however
and
to
consent
to
eat
a
mutton
chop
which
the
good
woman
insisted
upon
cooking
for
him
after
his
confession
that
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
breakfast
he
kept
telling
himself
that
there
was
no
hurry
that
he
was
not
wanted
in
that
his
presence
there
was
a
question
of
his
own
gratification
and
nothing
else
but
the
fever
in
his
mind
was
not
to
be
set
at
rest
go
easily
there
was
a
sense
of
hurry
upon
him
that
he
could
not
shake
off
argue
with
himself
as
wisely
as
he
would
he
took
a
hasty
meal
and
started
off
to
the
railway
station
directly
afterwards
though
there
was
no
train
to
carry
him
back
to
london
for
nearly
an
hour
it
was
weary
work
waiting
at
the
little
station
while
the
keen
march
wind
blew
sharply
across
the
unsheltered
platform
on
which
gilbert
paced
to
and
fro
in
his
restlessness
weary
work
waiting
with
that
sense
of
hurry
and
anxiety
upon
him
not
to
be
shaken
off
by
any
effort
he
could
make
to
take
a
hopeful
view
of
the
future
he
tried
to
think
of
those
two
whom
he
loved
best
on
earth
whose
union
he
had
taught
himself
by
a
marvellous
effort
of
unselfishness
to
contemplate
with
serenity
tried
to
think
of
them
in
the
supreme
happiness
of
their
restoration
to
each
other
but
he
could
not
bring
his
mind
to
the
realisation
of
this
picture
after
all
those
torments
of
doubt
and
perplexity
which
he
had
undergone
during
the
last
three
months
the
simple
fact
of
safety
seemed
too
good
a
thing
to
be
true
he
was
tortured
by
a
vague
sense
of
the
unreality
of
this
relief
that
had
come
so
suddenly
to
put
an
end
to
all
perplexities
i
feel
as
if
i
were
the
victim
of
some
hoax
some
miserable
delusion
he
said
to
himself
not
till
i
see
her
not
till
i
clasp
her
by
the
hand
shall
i
believe
that
she
is
really
given
back
to
us
and
in
his
eagerness
to
do
this
to
put
an
end
to
that
slow
torture
of
unreasonable
doubt
which
had
come
upon
him
since
the
reading
of
john
saltram
letter
the
delay
at
the
railway
station
was
an
almost
intolerable
ordeal
but
the
hour
came
to
an
end
at
last
the
place
awoke
from
its
blank
stillness
to
a
faint
show
of
life
and
motion
a
door
or
two
banged
a
young
woman
with
a
good
many
bundles
and
a
came
out
of
the
and
arranged
her
possessions
in
readiness
for
the
coming
train
a
porter
emerged
lazily
from
some
unknown
corner
and
looked
up
the
line
then
after
another
five
minutes
of
blankness
there
came
a
hoarse
throbbing
in
the
distance
a
bell
rang
and
the
panted
into
the
station
it
was
a
slow
train
unluckily
for
gilbert
impatience
which
stopped
everywhere
and
the
journey
to
london
took
him
over
an
hour
it
was
past
nine
when
a
hansom
drove
him
into
a
dull
thoroughfare
between
and
overshadowed
a
little
by
the
adjacent
gloom
of
the
university
hospital
and
altogether
a
street
gilbert
looked
up
eagerly
at
the
windows
of
number
expecting
to
see
lights
shining
and
some
visible
sign
of
rejoicing
even
upon
the
house
front
but
there
was
nothing
either
the
shutters
were
shut
or
there
was
no
light
within
for
the
windows
were
blank
and
dark
it
was
a
slight
thing
but
enough
to
intensify
that
shapeless
foreboding
against
which
he
had
been
struggling
throughout
his
journey
you
must
have
come
to
the
wrong
house
he
said
to
the
cabman
as
he
got
out
no
sir
this
is
yes
it
was
the
right
number
gilbert
read
it
on
the
door
and
yet
it
could
scarcely
be
the
right
house
for
tied
to
the
was
a
placard
with
apartments
engraved
upon
it
and
this
house
would
hardly
be
large
enough
to
accommodate
other
lodgers
besides
nowell
and
his
daughter
yet
there
is
no
knowing
the
capabilities
of
a
london
in
an
obscure
quarter
and
there
might
be
some
vacant
garret
in
the
roof
or
some
dreary
back
dignified
by
the
name
of
apartments
gilbert
gave
a
loud
hurried
knock
there
was
a
delay
which
seemed
to
him
interminable
then
a
hasty
shuffling
of
slipshod
feet
upon
the
basement
stairs
then
the
glimmer
of
a
light
through
the
keyhole
the
removal
of
a
chain
and
at
last
the
opening
of
the
door
it
was
opened
by
a
young
person
with
her
hair
dressed
in
the
prevailing
fashion
and
an
air
of
some
gentility
which
clashed
a
little
with
a
certain
slatternliness
that
pervaded
her
attire
she
was
rather
a
pretty
girl
but
had
the
faded
london
look
of
late
hours
and
precocious
cares
instead
of
the
fresh
bloom
and
girlish
brightness
which
should
have
belonged
to
her
did
you
please
to
wish
to
see
the
apartments
sir
she
asked
politely
no
i
want
to
see
and
the
lady
and
gentleman
who
are
lodging
here
he
scarcely
knew
under
what
name
he
ought
to
ask
for
marian
it
seemed
unnatural
to
him
now
to
speak
of
her
as
holbrook
the
lady
and
gentleman
sir
the
girl
exclaimed
with
a
surprised
air
there
no
one
lodging
here
now
nowell
and
his
daughter
left
yesterday
morning
left
yesterday
morning
yes
sir
they
went
away
to
liverpool
they
are
going
to
america
to
new
york
nowell
and
his
daughter
mrs
holbrook
yes
sir
that
was
the
lady
name
it
impossible
cried
gilbert
utterly
impossible
that
holbrook
would
go
to
america
she
has
ties
that
would
keep
her
in
england
a
husband
whom
she
would
never
abandon
in
that
manner
there
must
be
some
mistake
here
o
no
indeed
sir
there
no
mistake
i
saw
all
the
luggage
labelled
with
my
own
eyes
and
the
direction
was
new
york
by
and
holbrook
had
lots
of
dresses
made
and
all
sorts
of
things
and
as
to
her
husband
sir
her
father
told
me
that
he
treated
her
very
badly
and
that
she
never
meant
to
go
back
to
him
again
to
be
made
unhappy
by
him
she
was
going
to
new
york
to
live
with
nowell
all
the
rest
of
her
life
there
must
have
been
some
treachery
some
underhand
work
to
bring
this
about
did
she
go
of
her
own
free
will
o
dear
me
yes
sir
nowell
was
kindness
itself
to
her
and
she
was
very
fond
of
him
and
pleased
to
go
to
america
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
and
she
never
seemed
depressed
or
unhappy
i
never
noticed
her
being
so
sir
they
were
out
a
good
deal
you
see
for
nowell
was
a
gay
gentleman
very
fond
of
pleasure
and
he
would
have
holbrook
always
with
him
they
were
away
in
paris
ever
so
long
in
january
and
the
beginning
of
february
but
kept
on
the
lodgings
all
the
same
they
were
very
good
lodgers
had
they
many
visitors
no
sir
scarcely
any
one
except
a
gentleman
who
used
to
come
sometimes
of
an
evening
and
sit
drinking
with
nowell
he
was
his
lawyer
i
believe
but
i
never
heard
his
name
did
no
one
come
here
yesterday
to
inquire
for
holbrook
towards
evening
yes
sir
there
was
a
gentleman
came
in
a
cab
he
looked
very
ill
as
pale
as
death
and
was
in
a
dreadful
way
when
he
found
they
were
gone
he
asked
me
a
great
many
questions
the
same
as
you
asked
me
and
i
think
i
never
saw
any
one
so
as
he
seemed
he
did
say
much
about
that
either
but
it
was
easy
to
see
it
in
his
face
he
wanted
to
look
at
the
apartments
to
see
whether
he
could
find
anything
an
old
letter
or
that
might
be
a
help
to
him
in
going
after
his
friends
and
mother
took
him
upstairs
did
he
find
anything
no
sir
nowell
had
left
so
much
as
a
scrap
of
paper
about
the
place
so
the
gentleman
thanked
mother
and
went
away
in
the
same
cab
as
had
brought
him
do
you
know
where
he
was
going
i
fancy
he
was
going
to
liverpool
after
nowell
and
his
daughter
he
seemed
all
in
a
fever
like
a
person
that
ready
to
do
anything
desperate
but
i
heard
him
tell
the
cabman
yes
i
can
guess
where
he
was
going
but
what
could
he
want
there
gilbert
said
to
himself
while
the
girl
stared
at
him
wonderingly
thinking
that
he
as
well
as
the
other
gentleman
had
gone
distraught
on
account
of
nowell
daughter
thank
you
for
answering
my
questions
so
patiently
and
said
gilbert
slipping
some
silver
into
her
hand
for
his
quick
eye
had
observed
the
faded
condition
of
her
finery
and
a
general
air
of
poverty
conspicuous
in
her
aspect
stay
he
added
taking
out
his
if
you
should
hear
anything
farther
of
these
people
i
should
be
much
obliged
by
your
sending
me
word
at
that
address
i
wo
forget
sir
not
that
i
think
we
likely
to
hear
any
more
of
them
they
being
gone
straight
off
to
america
perhaps
not
but
if
you
do
hear
anything
let
me
know
he
had
dismissed
his
cab
on
alighting
in
believing
that
his
journey
was
ended
but
the
walk
to
was
a
short
one
and
he
set
out
at
a
rapid
pace
the
check
that
had
befallen
him
was
a
severe
one
it
seemed
a
deathblow
to
all
hope
a
dreary
realization
of
that
vague
dread
which
had
pursued
him
from
the
first
if
marian
had
indeed
started
for
america
what
new
difficulties
must
needs
attend
every
effort
to
bring
her
back
since
it
was
clear
that
her
father
interests
were
involved
in
keeping
her
under
his
influence
and
separating
her
entirely
from
her
husband
the
journey
to
new
york
was
no
doubt
intended
to
secure
this
state
of
things
in
america
in
that
vast
country
with
which
this
man
was
familiar
with
long
residence
how
easy
for
him
to
hide
her
for
ever
from
her
friends
how
vain
would
all
inquiries
all
researches
be
likely
to
prove
at
the
ultimate
moment
in
the
hour
of
hope
and
rejoicing
she
was
lost
to
them
irrevocably
yet
criminals
have
been
traced
upon
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
where
the
police
have
been
prompt
to
follow
them
gilbert
said
to
himself
glancing
for
an
instant
at
the
more
hopeful
side
of
the
question
but
not
often
where
they
got
anything
like
a
start
did
john
saltram
really
mean
to
follow
those
two
to
liverpool
i
wonder
such
a
journey
would
seem
like
madness
in
his
state
and
yet
what
a
triumph
if
he
should
have
been
in
time
to
prevent
their
starting
by
the
and
then
after
a
pause
he
asked
himself
what
could
he
want
with
branston
at
a
time
when
every
moment
was
precious
money
perhaps
he
could
have
had
none
with
him
yes
money
no
doubt
but
i
shall
discover
that
from
her
presently
and
may
learn
something
of
his
plans
into
the
bargain
gilbert
went
into
a
stationer
shop
and
purchased
a
there
was
a
train
leaving
euston
station
for
liverpool
at
a
quarter
to
eleven
he
might
be
in
time
for
that
after
seeing
branston
that
lady
happened
fortunately
to
be
at
home
and
received
gilbert
alone
in
her
favourite
back
where
he
found
her
ensconced
in
that
snug
retreat
made
by
the
japanese
screen
which
formed
a
kind
of
temple
on
one
side
of
the
there
had
been
a
final
rupture
between
adela
and
pallinson
a
few
days
before
and
that
matron
having
shown
her
cards
a
little
too
plainly
had
been
routed
by
an
unwonted
display
of
spirit
on
the
part
of
the
pretty
little
widow
she
was
gone
carrying
all
her
belongings
with
her
and
leaving
peace
and
liberty
behind
her
the
flush
of
triumph
was
still
upon
branston
and
this
unexpected
victory
brief
and
sudden
in
its
occurrence
like
most
great
victories
was
almost
a
consolation
to
her
for
that
disappointment
which
had
stricken
her
so
heavily
of
late
adela
branston
welcomed
her
visitor
very
graciously
but
gilbert
had
no
time
to
waste
upon
small
talk
and
after
a
hasty
apology
for
his
untimely
intrusion
dashed
at
once
into
the
question
he
had
come
to
ask
john
saltram
was
with
you
yesterday
evening
branston
he
said
pray
tell
me
the
purpose
that
brought
him
here
and
anything
you
know
of
his
plan
of
action
after
leaving
you
i
can
tell
you
very
little
about
that
he
was
going
upon
a
journey
he
told
me
that
evening
immediately
indeed
a
most
important
journey
but
he
did
not
tell
me
where
he
was
going
i
think
i
can
guess
that
said
gilbert
did
he
seem
much
agitated
no
he
was
quite
calm
but
he
had
a
resolute
air
like
a
man
who
has
some
great
purpose
to
achieve
i
thought
him
looking
very
white
and
weak
and
told
him
that
i
was
sure
he
was
too
ill
to
start
upon
a
long
journey
or
any
journey
i
begged
him
not
to
go
if
it
were
possible
to
avoid
going
and
used
every
argument
i
could
think
of
to
persuade
him
to
abandon
the
idea
of
such
a
thing
but
it
was
all
no
use
i
had
only
a
dozen
hours
to
live
i
must
go
he
said
he
came
to
ask
you
for
money
for
his
journey
did
he
not
he
did
i
suppose
to
so
close
a
friend
as
you
are
to
him
there
can
be
no
breach
of
confidence
in
my
admitting
that
he
came
to
borrow
any
i
might
happen
to
have
in
the
house
fortunately
i
had
a
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
by
me
in
hard
cash
and
he
took
that
he
wanted
as
much
as
that
asked
gilbert
eagerly
yes
he
said
he
was
likely
to
require
as
much
as
that
then
he
must
have
thought
of
going
to
america
to
america
travel
to
america
in
his
weak
state
of
health
cried
branston
aghast
yes
it
seems
like
madness
does
it
not
but
there
are
circumstances
under
which
a
man
may
be
excused
for
being
almost
mad
john
saltram
has
gone
in
pursuit
of
some
one
very
dear
to
him
some
one
who
has
been
separated
from
him
by
treachery
a
woman
adela
branston
fair
face
flushed
crimson
as
she
asked
the
question
a
woman
yes
no
doubt
he
was
in
pursuit
of
that
woman
whom
he
loved
better
than
her
i
can
not
stop
to
answer
a
single
question
now
my
dear
branston
gilbert
said
gently
you
shall
know
all
and
i
am
sure
your
generous
heart
will
forgive
any
wrong
that
has
been
done
you
in
this
business
good
night
i
have
to
catch
a
train
at
a
quarter
to
eleven
i
am
going
to
liverpool
after
mr
saltram
yes
i
do
not
consider
him
in
a
fitting
condition
to
travel
alone
i
hope
to
be
in
time
to
prevent
his
doing
anything
rash
but
how
will
you
find
him
i
must
make
a
round
of
the
hotels
till
i
discover
his
good
night
let
me
order
my
carriage
to
take
you
to
the
station
a
thousand
thanks
but
i
shall
be
there
before
your
carriage
would
be
ready
i
can
pick
up
a
cab
close
by
and
shall
have
time
to
call
at
my
lodgings
for
a
once
more
good
night
it
was
still
dark
when
gilbert
fenton
arrived
at
liverpool
he
threw
himself
upon
a
sofa
in
the
where
he
had
an
hour
or
so
of
uncomfortable
unrefreshing
sleep
and
then
roused
himself
and
went
out
to
begin
his
round
of
the
hotels
a
surly
of
unknown
age
and
prodigious
deafness
carried
him
from
house
to
house
first
to
all
the
principal
places
of
entertainment
aristocratic
family
and
commercial
then
to
more
obscure
taverns
and
until
the
sun
was
high
and
the
commerce
of
liverpool
in
full
swing
and
at
all
these
places
gilbert
questioned
and
chief
waiters
and
head
until
his
brain
grew
dizzy
by
mere
repetition
of
his
questions
but
no
positive
tidings
could
he
obtain
of
john
saltram
there
was
a
near
the
quay
where
it
seemed
just
possible
that
he
had
slept
but
even
here
the
description
was
of
the
vaguest
and
the
person
described
might
just
as
well
have
been
john
smith
as
john
saltram
gilbert
dismissed
the
and
his
vehicle
at
last
thoroughly
wearied
out
with
that
morning
work
he
went
to
one
of
the
hotels
took
a
hasty
breakfast
and
then
hurried
off
to
the
offices
belonging
to
the
owners
of
the
that
vessel
had
started
for
new
york
at
nine
on
the
previous
morning
and
john
saltram
had
gone
with
her
his
name
was
the
last
on
the
list
of
passengers
he
had
only
taken
his
passage
an
hour
before
the
steamer
left
liverpool
but
there
his
name
was
in
black
and
white
the
names
of
percival
nowell
and
of
holbrook
his
daughter
were
also
in
the
list
the
whole
business
was
clear
enough
and
there
was
nothing
more
that
gilbert
could
do
had
john
saltram
been
strong
and
well
his
friend
would
have
felt
nothing
but
satisfaction
in
the
thought
that
he
was
going
in
the
same
vessel
with
marian
and
would
without
doubt
bring
her
back
in
triumph
but
the
question
of
his
health
was
a
painful
one
to
contemplate
could
he
or
could
he
not
endure
the
strain
that
he
had
put
upon
himself
within
the
last
hours
in
desperate
straits
men
can
do
desperate
things
there
was
always
that
fact
to
be
remembered
but
still
john
saltram
might
break
down
under
the
burden
he
had
taken
upon
himself
and
when
gilbert
went
back
to
london
that
afternoon
he
was
sorely
anxious
about
this
feeble
traveller
he
found
a
letter
from
him
at
the
lodgings
in
a
hurried
letter
written
at
liverpool
the
night
before
john
saltram
departure
he
had
arrived
there
too
late
to
get
on
board
the
that
night
and
had
ascertained
that
the
vessel
was
to
leave
at
nine
next
morning
i
shall
take
my
passage
in
her
in
case
of
the
worst
he
wrote
and
if
i
can
not
see
marian
and
persuade
her
to
come
on
shore
with
me
i
must
go
with
her
to
new
york
heaven
knows
what
power
her
father
may
use
against
me
in
the
brief
opportunity
i
shall
have
for
seeing
her
before
the
vessel
starts
but
he
ca
prevent
my
being
their
and
once
afloat
it
shall
go
hard
with
me
if
i
can
not
make
my
dear
girl
hear
reason
do
not
be
uneasy
about
my
health
dear
old
friend
you
see
how
well
i
am
keeping
up
under
all
this
strain
upon
body
and
mind
you
will
see
me
come
back
from
america
a
new
man
strong
enough
to
prove
my
gratitude
for
your
devotion
in
some
shape
or
other
i
trust
in
god
chapter
xli
outward
bound
the
bustle
of
departure
was
at
its
culminating
point
when
john
saltram
went
on
board
the
captain
and
officers
scudding
hither
and
thither
giving
orders
and
answering
inquiries
at
every
point
with
a
sharp
short
decisive
air
as
of
commanding
powers
in
the
last
before
a
great
battle
steward
and
his
underlings
ubiquitous
passengers
roaming
vaguely
to
and
fro
in
quest
of
nothing
particular
and
in
a
state
of
in
this
scene
of
confusion
there
was
no
one
to
answer
saltram
eager
inquires
about
those
travellers
whom
he
had
pursued
to
this
point
he
did
contrive
just
about
ten
minutes
before
the
vessel
sailed
to
capture
the
ubiquitous
steward
by
the
and
to
ask
for
tidings
of
nowell
before
that
excited
functionary
could
wrench
himself
away
nowell
sir
upon
my
word
sir
i
ca
say
yes
there
is
a
gentleman
of
that
name
on
board
number
and
got
a
daughter
with
him
tall
dark
gentleman
with
a
moustache
and
beard
yes
sir
he
was
on
deck
just
now
on
the
bridge
but
i
do
see
him
i
suppose
he
gone
below
better
look
for
him
in
the
saloon
sir
the
ten
minutes
were
over
before
john
saltram
had
seen
half
the
faces
on
board
the
crowded
vessel
but
in
his
hurried
wanderings
to
and
fro
eager
to
see
that
one
face
which
he
so
ardently
desired
to
behold
once
wore
he
had
met
nothing
but
strangers
there
was
no
help
for
it
the
vessel
would
steam
out
seaward
presently
and
he
must
needs
go
with
her
at
the
best
he
had
expected
this
it
was
not
likely
that
even
if
he
could
have
obtained
speech
with
his
wife
she
could
have
been
prevailed
upon
immediately
to
desert
the
father
whose
fortunes
she
had
elected
to
follow
and
return
to
shore
with
the
husband
she
had
abandoned
her
mind
must
have
been
poisoned
her
judgment
perverted
before
she
could
have
left
him
thus
of
her
own
free
will
and
it
would
need
the
light
of
calm
reason
to
set
things
right
again
no
john
saltram
could
scarcely
hope
to
carry
her
off
by
a
in
the
face
of
the
artful
schemer
who
had
evidently
obtained
so
strong
an
influence
over
her
that
she
could
for
a
moment
contemplate
this
voyage
to
america
with
her
father
was
enough
to
demonstrate
the
revolution
that
must
have
taken
place
in
her
feelings
towards
her
husband
slander
and
lies
are
very
strong
john
saltram
said
to
himself
but
i
do
not
think
when
my
dear
love
and
i
are
once
face
to
face
any
power
on
earth
can
prevail
against
me
she
must
be
changed
indeed
if
it
can
she
must
be
changed
indeed
if
anything
but
a
lie
can
part
us
he
had
come
on
board
the
prepared
for
the
worst
and
furnished
with
a
slender
outfit
for
the
voyage
hurriedly
purchased
at
a
liverpool
clothier
he
had
plenty
of
money
in
his
pocket
enough
to
pay
for
his
own
and
his
wife
return
passage
and
the
thought
of
this
useless
journey
across
the
atlantic
troubled
him
very
little
what
did
it
matter
where
he
was
if
she
were
with
him
the
mental
torture
he
had
undergone
during
all
this
time
in
which
he
had
seemed
in
danger
of
losing
her
altogether
had
taught
him
how
dear
she
was
how
precious
and
perfect
a
treasure
he
had
held
so
lightly
the
vessel
steamed
put
of
the
mersey
and
john
saltram
indifferent
to
the
last
glimpse
of
his
native
land
was
still
roaming
hither
and
thither
in
quest
of
the
familiar
face
he
longed
with
such
a
passionate
yearning
to
see
but
up
to
this
point
he
sought
for
his
wife
in
vain
holbrook
had
evidently
retired
at
once
to
her
cabin
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
to
establish
a
channel
of
communication
with
her
by
means
of
the
stewardess
he
found
this
official
with
some
trouble
and
so
desperately
busy
that
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
obtain
speech
with
her
pursued
as
she
was
by
forlorn
and
distracted
female
passengers
clamorously
eager
to
know
where
she
had
put
that
waterproof
cloak
or
maud
or
or
he
did
at
last
contrive
to
enlist
her
services
in
his
behalf
and
extort
some
answer
to
his
questions
yes
she
told
him
holbrook
was
on
board
number
she
had
gone
to
her
room
at
once
but
would
appear
at
no
doubt
if
she
was
john
saltram
tore
a
blank
leaf
from
his
and
wrote
one
hasty
line
i
am
here
marian
let
me
see
you
for
god
sake
john
holbrook
if
you
take
that
to
the
lady
in
number
i
shall
be
exceedingly
obliged
he
said
to
the
stewardess
slipping
into
her
willing
hand
at
the
same
time
yes
sir
this
very
minute
sir
john
saltram
sat
down
upon
a
bench
outside
the
ladies
cabin
in
a
sort
of
antechamber
between
the
steward
pantry
and
strongly
perfumed
with
the
odour
of
grocery
and
waited
for
marian
coming
he
had
no
shadow
of
doubt
that
she
would
come
to
him
instantly
in
defiance
of
any
other
guardian
or
counseller
whatever
lies
might
have
been
told
her
however
she
might
have
been
taught
to
doubt
him
he
had
a
perfect
faith
in
the
power
of
his
immediate
presence
they
had
but
to
meet
face
to
face
and
all
would
be
well
indeed
there
was
need
that
things
should
be
well
for
john
saltram
very
speedily
he
had
set
nature
at
defiance
so
far
acting
as
if
physical
weakness
were
unknown
to
him
there
are
periods
in
a
man
life
in
which
nothing
seems
impossible
to
him
in
which
by
the
mere
force
of
will
he
triumphs
over
impossibility
but
such
conquests
are
apt
to
be
of
the
briefest
john
saltram
felt
that
he
must
very
soon
break
down
the
heavily
throbbing
heart
the
aching
limbs
the
dizzy
sight
and
parched
throat
told
him
how
much
this
desperate
chase
had
cost
him
if
he
had
strength
enough
to
clasp
his
wife
hand
to
give
her
loving
greeting
and
tell
her
that
he
was
true
it
would
be
about
as
much
as
he
could
hope
to
achieve
and
then
he
felt
that
he
would
be
glad
to
crawl
into
any
corner
of
the
vessel
where
he
might
find
rest
the
stewardess
came
back
to
him
presently
with
rather
a
discomfited
air
the
lady
says
she
is
too
ill
to
see
any
one
sir
she
told
john
saltram
but
under
any
circumstances
she
must
decline
to
see
you
she
said
that
my
wife
told
you
that
your
wife
sir
good
gracious
me
is
the
lady
in
number
your
wife
she
came
on
board
with
her
father
and
i
understood
they
were
only
two
in
party
yes
she
came
with
her
father
her
father
treachery
has
separated
her
from
me
but
a
few
words
would
explain
everything
if
i
could
only
see
her
he
thought
it
best
to
tell
the
woman
the
truth
strange
as
it
might
seem
to
her
her
sympathies
were
more
likely
to
be
enlisted
in
his
favour
if
she
knew
the
actual
state
of
the
case
did
holbrook
positively
decline
to
see
me
he
asked
again
scarcely
able
to
believe
that
marian
could
have
resisted
even
that
brief
appeal
scrawled
upon
a
scrap
of
paper
she
did
indeed
sir
answered
the
stewardess
nothing
could
be
more
positive
than
her
manner
i
told
her
how
anxious
you
seemed
for
i
could
see
it
in
your
face
you
see
sir
when
you
gave
me
the
paper
and
i
really
did
like
to
bring
you
such
a
message
but
it
was
no
use
decline
to
see
him
the
lady
said
be
sure
you
bring
me
no
more
messages
from
this
gentleman
and
with
that
sir
she
tore
up
the
bit
of
paper
as
cool
as
could
be
but
dear
me
sir
how
ill
you
do
look
to
be
sure
i
have
been
very
ill
i
came
from
a
to
follow
my
wife
had
you
better
go
and
lie
down
a
little
sir
you
look
as
if
you
could
scarcely
stand
shall
i
fetch
the
steward
for
you
no
thanks
i
can
find
my
way
to
my
berth
i
daresay
yes
i
suppose
i
had
better
go
and
lie
down
i
can
do
no
more
yet
awhile
he
could
do
no
more
and
had
indeed
barely
strength
to
stagger
to
his
which
he
discovered
at
last
with
some
difficulty
here
he
flung
himself
down
dressed
as
he
was
and
lay
like
a
log
for
hours
not
sleeping
but
powerless
to
move
hand
or
foot
and
with
his
brain
racked
by
torturing
thoughts
as
soon
as
i
am
able
to
stand
again
i
will
see
her
father
and
exact
a
reckoning
from
him
he
said
to
himself
again
and
again
during
those
long
dreary
hours
of
prostration
but
when
the
next
day
came
he
was
too
weak
to
raise
himself
from
his
narrow
bed
and
on
the
next
day
after
that
he
was
no
better
the
steward
was
much
concerned
by
his
feeble
condition
especially
as
it
was
no
common
case
of
for
john
saltram
had
told
him
that
he
was
never
he
brought
the
prostrate
traveller
and
brandy
and
tried
to
tempt
him
to
eat
rich
soups
of
a
nutritious
character
but
the
sick
man
would
take
nothing
except
an
occasional
draught
of
on
the
third
day
of
the
voyage
the
steward
was
very
anxious
to
bring
the
ship
surgeon
to
look
at
saltram
but
against
this
john
saltram
resolutely
set
his
face
for
pity
sake
do
bore
me
with
any
more
doctors
he
cried
fretfully
i
have
had
enough
of
that
kind
of
thing
the
man
can
do
nothing
for
me
i
am
knocked
up
with
over
exertion
and
excitement
all
my
strength
will
come
back
to
me
sooner
or
later
if
i
lie
quietly
here
the
steward
gave
way
for
the
time
being
upon
this
appeal
and
the
surgeon
was
not
summoned
but
saltram
strength
seemed
very
slow
to
return
to
him
he
could
not
sleep
he
could
only
lie
there
listening
to
all
the
noises
of
the
ship
the
perpetual
creaking
and
rattling
and
tramping
of
footsteps
above
his
head
and
tortured
by
his
impatience
to
be
astir
again
he
would
not
stand
upon
punctilio
this
time
he
told
himself
he
would
go
straight
to
the
door
of
marian
cabin
and
stand
there
until
she
came
out
to
him
was
she
not
his
wife
his
very
own
powerless
to
hold
him
at
bay
in
this
manner
his
strength
did
not
come
back
to
him
that
wakeful
prostration
in
which
the
brain
was
always
busy
while
the
aching
body
lay
still
did
not
appear
to
be
a
curative
process
in
the
course
of
that
third
night
of
the
voyage
john
saltram
was
delirious
much
to
the
alarm
of
his
the
single
sharer
of
his
cabin
a
nervous
elderly
gentleman
who
objected
to
his
illness
altogether
as
an
outrage
upon
himself
and
was
indignantly
desirous
to
know
whether
it
was
contagious
so
the
doctor
was
brought
to
the
sick
man
early
next
morning
whether
he
would
or
not
and
went
through
the
usual
investigations
and
promised
to
administer
the
usual
sedatives
and
assured
the
anxious
passenger
that
saltram
complaint
was
in
nowise
infectious
he
has
evidently
been
suffering
from
serious
illness
lately
and
has
been
himself
said
the
doctor
that
seems
very
clear
we
shall
contrive
to
bring
him
round
in
a
few
days
i
daresay
though
he
certainly
has
got
into
a
very
low
state
the
doctor
said
this
rather
gravely
on
which
the
passenger
again
became
disturbed
of
aspect
a
death
on
board
ship
must
needs
be
such
an
unpleasant
business
and
he
really
had
not
bargained
for
anything
of
that
kind
what
was
the
use
of
paying
fare
on
board
a
vessel
if
one
were
subject
to
annoyance
of
this
sort
in
the
steerage
of
an
overcrowded
emigrant
ship
such
a
thing
might
be
a
matter
of
course
a
mere
natural
incident
of
the
voyage
but
on
board
the
it
was
most
unlooked
for
he
not
going
to
die
is
he
asked
the
passenger
with
an
injured
air
o
dear
no
i
should
hope
not
i
have
no
apprehension
of
that
sort
replied
the
surgeon
promptly
he
would
no
doubt
have
said
the
same
thing
up
to
within
an
hour
or
so
of
the
patient
decease
there
is
an
extreme
debility
that
is
all
he
went
on
quite
cheerfully
and
if
we
can
induce
him
to
take
plenty
of
nourishment
we
shall
get
on
very
well
i
daresay
after
this
the
nervous
passenger
was
profoundly
interested
in
the
amount
of
refreshment
consumed
by
the
patient
and
questioned
the
steward
about
him
with
a
most
sympathetic
air
john
saltram
otherwise
john
holbrook
was
not
destined
to
die
upon
this
outward
voyage
he
was
very
eager
to
be
well
or
at
least
to
be
at
liberty
to
move
about
again
and
perhaps
this
impatient
desire
of
his
helped
in
some
measure
to
bring
about
his
recovery
the
will
physiologists
tell
us
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
these
things
the
voyage
was
a
prosperous
one
the
good
ship
steamed
gaily
across
the
atlantic
through
the
bleak
spring
weather
and
there
was
plenty
of
eating
and
drinking
and
joviality
and
flirtation
on
board
her
while
john
saltram
lay
upon
his
back
very
helpless
languishing
to
be
astir
once
more
during
these
long
dreary
days
and
nights
he
had
contrived
to
send
several
messages
to
the
lady
in
the
feeble
pencil
scrawls
imploring
her
to
come
to
him
telling
her
that
he
was
very
ill
at
death
door
almost
and
desired
nothing
so
much
as
to
see
her
if
only
for
a
moment
but
the
answer
by
word
of
mouth
of
the
steward
or
stewardess
always
was
unfailingly
to
the
same
effect
the
lady
in
number
refused
to
hold
any
communication
with
the
sick
gentleman
she
a
hard
one
the
steward
remarked
to
the
stewardess
when
they
talked
the
matter
over
in
a
comfortable
manner
during
the
progress
of
a
snug
little
supper
in
the
steward
cabin
she
must
be
an
one
to
stand
out
against
him
like
that
if
he
is
her
husband
and
i
suppose
he
is
i
told
her
when
i
took
his
message
how
bad
he
was
and
that
it
was
a
chance
if
he
ever
went
ashore
alive
but
she
was
walking
up
and
down
deck
with
her
father
ten
minutes
afterwards
laughing
and
talking
like
anything
i
suppose
he
been
a
bad
lot
peterson
and
deserves
no
better
from
her
but
still
it
does
seem
hard
to
see
him
lying
there
and
his
wife
so
near
him
and
yet
refusing
to
go
and
see
him
i
no
common
patience
with
her
said
the
stewardess
with
acrimony
the
creature
flaunting
about
like
that
with
a
sick
husband
within
a
stone
throw
of
her
suppose
he
is
to
blame
martin
whatever
his
faults
may
have
been
it
is
the
time
for
a
wife
to
remember
them
to
this
martin
responded
dubiously
remarking
that
there
were
some
carryings
on
upon
the
part
of
husbands
which
it
was
difficult
for
a
wife
not
to
remember
the
good
ship
sped
on
unhindered
by
adverse
winds
or
foul
weather
and
was
within
hours
of
her
destination
when
john
saltram
was
at
last
able
to
crawl
out
of
the
cabin
where
he
had
lain
for
some
eight
or
nine
days
crippled
and
helpless
the
first
purpose
which
he
set
himself
to
accomplish
was
an
interview
with
marian
father
he
wanted
to
grapple
his
enemy
somehow
to
ascertain
the
nature
of
the
game
that
was
being
played
against
him
he
had
kept
himself
very
quiet
for
this
purpose
wishing
to
take
percival
nowell
by
surprise
and
on
this
last
day
but
one
of
the
voyage
when
he
was
able
for
the
first
time
to
rise
from
his
berth
no
one
but
the
steward
and
the
surgeon
knew
that
he
intended
so
to
rise
he
had
taken
the
steward
in
some
measure
into
his
confidence
and
that
official
after
helping
him
to
dress
left
him
seated
in
the
cabin
while
he
went
to
ascertain
the
whereabouts
of
nowell
martin
the
steward
came
back
after
about
five
minutes
he
in
the
saloon
sir
reading
quite
alone
you
could
have
a
better
opportunity
of
speaking
to
him
that
a
good
fellow
then
i
go
at
once
you
better
take
my
arm
sir
you
as
weak
as
a
baby
and
the
ship
lurches
a
good
deal
i
not
very
strong
certainly
i
begin
to
think
i
never
shall
be
strong
again
do
you
know
martin
i
was
once
stroke
in
a
university
eight
not
much
vigour
in
my
biceps
now
eh
it
was
only
a
few
paces
from
one
cabin
to
the
other
but
saltram
could
scarcely
have
gone
so
far
without
the
steward
supporting
arm
he
was
a
figure
with
a
white
wan
face
as
he
tottered
along
the
narrow
passage
between
the
tables
making
his
way
to
that
end
of
the
saloon
where
percival
nowell
lounged
luxuriously
with
his
legs
stretched
at
full
length
upon
the
sofa
and
a
book
in
his
hand
nowell
i
believe
said
the
sick
man
as
the
other
looked
up
at
him
with
consummate
coolness
whatever
his
feelings
might
be
with
regard
to
his
daughter
husband
he
had
had
ample
time
to
prepare
himself
for
an
encounter
with
him
yes
my
name
is
nowell
but
i
have
really
not
the
honour
to
you
do
not
know
me
answered
john
saltram
no
but
it
is
time
you
did
so
i
am
your
daughter
husband
john
holbrook
indeed
i
have
heard
that
she
has
been
persecuted
by
the
messages
of
some
person
calling
himself
her
husband
you
are
that
person
i
presume
i
have
tried
to
persuade
my
wife
to
see
me
yes
and
i
mean
to
see
her
before
this
vessel
arrives
in
port
but
if
the
lady
in
question
refuses
to
have
anything
to
say
to
you
we
shall
soon
put
that
to
the
test
i
have
been
too
ill
to
stir
ever
since
i
came
on
board
or
you
would
have
heard
of
me
before
this
nowell
now
that
i
can
move
about
once
more
i
shall
find
a
way
to
assert
my
claims
you
may
be
sure
but
in
the
first
place
i
want
to
know
by
what
right
you
stole
my
wife
away
from
her
home
by
what
right
you
brought
her
on
this
voyage
before
i
answer
that
question
holbrook
as
you
choose
to
call
yourself
i
ask
you
another
by
what
right
do
you
call
yourself
my
daughter
husband
what
evidence
have
you
to
produce
to
prove
that
you
are
not
a
impostor
you
do
carry
your
about
with
you
i
daresay
and
in
the
absence
of
some
kind
of
documentary
evidence
what
is
to
convince
me
that
you
are
what
you
pretend
to
be
my
daughter
husband
the
evidence
of
your
daughter
own
senses
place
me
face
to
face
with
her
she
will
not
deny
my
identity
but
how
if
my
daughter
declines
to
see
you
as
she
does
most
positively
she
has
suffered
enough
at
your
hands
and
is
only
too
glad
to
be
released
from
you
she
has
suffered
she
is
glad
to
be
released
why
you
most
consummate
scoundrel
cried
john
saltram
there
never
was
an
unkind
word
spoken
between
my
wife
and
me
she
was
the
best
most
devoted
of
women
and
nothing
but
the
vilest
treachery
could
have
separated
us
i
know
not
what
villanous
slander
you
have
made
her
believe
or
by
what
means
you
lured
her
away
from
me
but
i
know
that
a
few
words
between
us
would
let
in
the
light
upon
your
plot
you
had
better
make
the
best
of
a
bad
position
nowell
as
my
wife
father
you
know
you
are
pretty
sure
to
escape
whatever
my
inclination
might
be
my
regard
for
her
would
make
me
indulgent
to
you
you
find
candour
avail
you
best
in
this
case
depend
upon
it
your
daughter
has
inherited
a
fortune
and
you
want
to
put
your
hand
upon
it
altogether
it
would
be
wiser
to
moderate
your
desires
and
be
content
with
a
fair
share
of
the
inheritance
your
daughter
is
not
the
woman
to
treat
you
ungenerously
nor
am
i
the
man
to
create
any
hindrance
to
her
generosity
i
can
make
no
bargain
with
you
sir
replied
nowell
with
the
same
cool
audacity
of
manner
that
had
distinguished
him
throughout
the
interview
nor
am
i
prepared
to
admit
your
claim
to
the
position
you
assume
but
if
my
daughter
is
your
wife
she
left
you
of
her
own
free
will
under
no
coercion
of
mine
and
she
must
return
to
you
in
the
same
manner
or
you
must
put
the
machinery
of
the
law
in
force
to
compel
her
and
i
flatter
myself
in
a
free
country
like
america
will
be
rather
a
difficult
business
it
was
hard
for
john
saltram
to
hear
any
man
talk
like
this
and
not
be
able
to
knock
him
down
but
in
his
present
condition
marian
husband
could
not
have
grappled
a
child
and
he
knew
it
you
are
an
outrageous
scoundrel
he
said
between
his
set
teeth
tortured
by
that
most
ardent
desire
to
dash
his
clenched
fist
into
nowell
handsome
face
you
are
a
most
consummate
villain
and
you
know
it
hard
words
mean
so
little
returned
nowell
coolly
and
go
for
so
little
that
kind
of
language
before
witnesses
would
be
actionable
but
upon
my
word
it
would
be
mere
child
play
on
my
part
to
notice
it
especially
to
a
man
in
your
condition
you
better
claim
your
wife
from
the
captain
and
see
what
he
will
say
to
you
i
have
told
him
that
there
some
on
board
who
pretends
to
be
husband
so
he
be
quite
prepared
to
hear
your
statement
john
saltram
left
the
saloon
in
silence
it
was
worse
than
useless
talking
to
this
man
who
presumed
upon
his
helpless
state
and
openly
defied
him
his
next
effort
must
be
to
see
marian
this
he
found
impossible
for
the
time
being
at
any
rate
the
number
was
an
apartment
a
little
bigger
than
a
opening
out
of
a
larger
cabin
and
in
that
cabin
there
reposed
a
ponderous
matron
who
had
suffered
from
throughout
the
voyage
and
who
could
in
no
wise
permit
a
masculine
intruder
to
invade
the
scene
of
her
retirement
the
idea
of
any
blockade
of
marian
door
was
therefore
futile
he
must
needs
wait
as
patiently
as
he
might
till
she
appeared
of
her
own
free
will
he
could
not
have
to
wait
very
long
something
less
than
a
day
and
a
night
the
steward
had
told
him
would
bring
them
to
the
end
of
the
voyage
saltram
went
on
deck
still
assisted
by
the
friendly
steward
and
seated
himself
in
a
sheltered
corner
of
the
vessel
hoping
that
the
might
bring
him
back
some
remnant
of
his
lost
strength
the
ship
surgeon
had
advised
him
to
get
a
little
fresh
air
as
soon
as
he
felt
himself
able
to
bear
it
so
he
sat
in
his
obscure
nook
very
helpless
and
very
feeble
meditating
upon
what
he
should
do
when
the
final
moment
came
and
he
had
to
claim
his
wife
he
had
no
idea
of
making
his
wrongs
known
to
the
captain
unless
as
a
last
desperate
resource
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
make
marian
the
subject
of
a
vulgar
squabble
no
it
was
to
herself
alone
he
would
appeal
it
was
in
the
natural
instinct
of
her
own
heart
that
he
would
trust
very
long
and
weary
seemed
the
remaining
hours
of
that
joyless
voyage
saltram
was
fain
to
go
back
to
his
cabin
after
an
hour
on
deck
there
to
lie
and
await
the
morrow
he
had
need
to
husband
his
strength
for
the
coming
encounter
the
steward
told
him
in
the
evening
that
holbrook
had
not
dined
in
the
saloon
that
day
as
usual
she
had
kept
her
cabin
closely
and
complained
of
illness
the
morning
dawned
at
last
after
what
had
seemed
an
endless
night
to
john
saltram
lying
awake
in
his
narrow
berth
a
bleak
blusterous
morning
with
the
cold
gray
light
staring
in
at
the
like
an
unfriendly
face
there
was
no
promise
in
such
a
daybreak
it
was
only
light
and
nothing
more
saltram
having
duly
deliberated
the
matter
during
the
long
hours
of
that
weary
night
had
decided
that
his
wisest
course
was
to
lie
until
the
last
moment
the
very
moment
of
landing
and
then
to
come
boldly
forward
and
make
his
claim
it
was
useless
to
waste
his
strength
in
any
futile
endeavour
to
baffle
so
hardy
a
scoundrel
as
percival
nowell
at
the
last
when
marian
was
leaving
the
ship
it
would
be
time
for
him
to
assert
his
right
as
her
husband
and
to
defy
the
wretch
who
had
beguiled
her
away
from
him
having
once
arrived
at
this
decision
he
was
able
to
await
the
issue
of
events
with
some
degree
of
tranquility
he
had
no
doubt
even
now
of
his
wife
affection
for
him
no
fear
as
to
the
ultimate
triumph
of
her
love
over
all
the
lies
and
artifices
of
that
scheming
scoundrel
her
father
it
was
nearly
three
in
the
afternoon
when
the
steward
came
to
tell
him
that
they
were
on
the
point
of
arriving
at
their
destination
the
wharf
where
they
were
to
land
was
within
sight
the
man
had
promised
to
give
him
due
warning
of
this
event
and
john
saltram
had
therefore
contrived
to
keep
himself
quiet
amidst
all
the
feverish
impatience
and
confusion
of
mind
prevailing
amongst
the
other
passengers
he
was
rewarded
for
his
prudence
for
when
he
rose
to
go
on
deck
he
found
himself
stronger
than
he
had
felt
yet
he
went
up
the
took
his
place
close
to
the
spot
at
which
the
passengers
must
all
leave
the
vessel
and
waited
new
york
was
very
near
the
day
had
been
cold
and
showery
but
the
sun
was
shining
now
and
the
whole
scene
looked
bright
and
gay
every
one
seemed
in
high
spirits
as
if
the
new
world
they
were
about
to
touch
contained
for
them
a
certainty
of
elysium
it
was
such
a
delicious
relief
to
arrive
at
the
great
lively
yankee
city
after
the
tedium
of
a
voyage
pleasant
and
easy
as
the
transit
had
been
john
saltram
looked
eagerly
among
the
faces
of
the
crowd
but
neither
percival
nowell
nor
his
daughter
were
to
be
seen
amongst
them
presently
the
vessel
touched
the
wharf
and
the
travellers
began
to
move
towards
the
gangway
he
watched
them
one
by
one
breathlessly
at
the
very
last
nowell
stepped
quickly
forward
with
a
veiled
figure
on
his
arm
she
was
closely
veiled
her
face
quite
hidden
by
thick
black
lace
and
she
was
clinging
with
something
of
a
frightened
air
to
her
arm
john
saltram
sprang
up
from
his
post
of
observation
and
confronted
the
two
before
they
could
leave
the
vessel
marian
he
said
in
slow
decided
tone
let
go
that
man
arm
you
will
leave
this
vessel
with
me
and
with
no
one
else
stand
out
of
the
way
fellow
cried
percival
nowell
my
daughter
can
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
marian
for
god
sake
obey
me
there
is
the
vilest
treachery
in
this
man
conduct
let
go
his
arm
my
love
my
darling
come
with
me
there
was
a
passionate
appeal
in
his
tone
but
it
produced
no
answer
marian
he
cried
still
interposing
himself
between
these
two
and
the
passage
to
the
landing
wharf
marian
i
will
have
some
answer
you
have
had
your
answer
sir
said
percival
nowell
trying
to
push
him
aside
this
lady
does
not
know
you
do
you
want
to
make
a
scene
and
render
yourself
ridiculous
to
every
one
here
there
are
plenty
of
lunatic
asylums
in
new
york
that
will
accommodate
you
if
you
are
determined
to
make
yourself
eligible
for
them
marian
repeated
john
saltram
without
vouchsafing
the
faintest
notice
of
this
speech
marian
speak
to
me
and
then
as
there
came
no
answer
from
that
shrinking
clinging
figure
with
a
sudden
spring
forward
that
brought
him
quite
close
to
her
john
saltram
tore
the
veil
away
from
the
hidden
face
this
must
be
some
impostor
he
said
this
is
not
my
wife
he
was
right
the
creature
clinging
to
percival
nowell
arm
was
a
pretty
woman
enough
with
rather
red
hair
and
a
common
face
she
was
about
marian
height
and
that
was
the
only
likeness
between
them
the
spectators
of
this
brief
fracas
crowded
round
the
actors
in
it
seeing
nothing
but
the
insult
offered
to
a
lady
and
highly
indignant
with
john
saltram
and
amidst
their
murmurs
percival
nowell
pushed
his
way
to
the
shore
with
the
woman
still
clinging
to
his
arm

persistence
she
could
not
forget
that
wild
unearthly
sound
she
could
not
help
continually
trying
to
find
some
solution
for
the
mystery
until
her
brain
was
tired
with
the
perpetual
effort
ponder
upon
this
matter
as
she
might
she
could
find
no
reasonable
explanation
of
the
enigma
and
in
spite
of
her
common
sense
a
quality
of
which
she
possessed
a
very
fair
share
she
was
fain
to
believe
at
last
that
this
grim
old
house
was
haunted
and
that
the
agonised
shriek
she
and
tadman
had
heard
that
night
was
only
the
ghostly
sound
of
some
cry
wrung
from
a
bleeding
heart
in
days
gone
by
the
echo
of
an
anguish
that
had
been
in
the
far
past
she
even
went
so
far
as
to
ask
her
husband
one
day
if
he
had
ever
heard
that
the
house
was
haunted
and
whether
there
was
any
record
of
crime
or
wrong
that
had
been
done
in
it
in
the
past
whitelaw
seemed
scarcely
to
relish
the
question
but
after
one
of
his
meditative
pauses
laughed
his
wife
inquiry
to
scorn
and
told
her
that
there
were
no
ghosts
at
wyncomb
except
the
ghosts
of
dead
rats
that
had
ravaged
the
granaries
and
certainly
seemed
to
rise
from
their
graves
in
spite
of
poison
and
traps
cats
and
ferrets
and
that
as
to
anything
that
had
been
done
in
the
house
in
days
gone
by
he
had
never
heard
tell
that
his
ancestors
had
ever
done
anything
but
eat
and
drink
and
sleep
and
save
money
from
year
end
to
year
end
and
a
hard
time
they
had
of
it
to
pay
their
way
and
put
something
by
in
the
face
of
all
the
difficulties
that
surround
the
path
of
a
farmer
if
ellen
whitelaw
life
had
been
as
the
lives
of
happier
women
full
of
small
daily
cares
and
domestic
interests
the
memory
of
that
unearthly
scream
would
no
doubt
have
faded
out
of
her
mind
ere
long
instead
of
remaining
as
it
did
a
source
of
constant
perplexity
to
her
but
there
was
no
interest
no
single
charm
in
her
life
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
left
for
her
to
care
for
the
fertile
flats
around
wyncomb
farmhouse
bounded
her
universe
day
by
day
she
rose
to
perform
the
same
monotonous
duties
sustained
by
no
lofty
aim
cheered
by
neither
friendship
nor
affection
for
she
could
not
teach
herself
to
feel
anything
warmer
than
toleration
for
her
daily
companion
tadman
only
working
laboriously
because
existence
was
more
endurable
to
her
when
she
was
busy
than
when
she
was
idle
it
was
scarcely
strange
then
that
she
brooded
upon
the
memory
of
that
night
when
the
nameless
stranger
had
come
to
wyncomb
and
that
she
tried
to
put
the
fact
of
his
coming
and
that
other
incident
of
the
cry
together
and
to
make
something
out
of
the
two
events
by
that
means
but
put
them
together
as
she
might
she
was
no
nearer
any
solution
of
the
mystery
that
her
husband
and
the
stranger
could
have
failed
to
hear
that
piercing
shriek
seemed
almost
impossible
yet
both
had
denied
hearing
it
the
story
of
the
stranger
having
knocked
his
shin
and
cried
out
on
doing
so
appeared
like
a
feeble
attempt
to
account
for
that
wild
cry
vain
and
hopeless
were
all
her
endeavours
to
arrive
at
any
reasonable
explanation
and
her
attempts
to
get
anything
like
an
opinion
out
of
tadman
were
utterly
useless
whitelaw
cousin
was
still
inclined
to
take
a
gloomy
view
of
the
stranger
visit
in
spite
of
her
kinsman
assurance
that
the
transaction
between
himself
and
the
unknown
was
a
profitable
one
if
not
parting
with
a
farm
tadman
opined
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
business
and
when
did
ever
fail
to
lead
to
ruin
sooner
or
later
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
ellen
sighed
remembering
how
her
father
had
squandered
his
employer
money
on
the
and
how
for
that
folly
of
his
she
had
been
doomed
to
become
stephen
whitelaw
wife
but
there
did
not
seem
to
her
to
be
anything
of
the
horsey
element
in
her
husband
composition
he
was
never
away
from
home
except
to
attend
to
his
business
at
market
and
she
had
never
seen
him
spelling
over
the
as
her
father
had
been
wont
to
do
night
after
night
with
a
perplexed
brow
and
an
anxious
face
making
calculations
upon
the
margin
of
the
print
every
now
and
then
with
a
stump
of
lead
pencil
and
chewing
the
end
of
it
meditatively
in
the
intervals
of
his
lection
although
whitelaw
did
not
like
tadman
associate
the
idea
of
the
stranger
visit
with
any
apprehension
of
her
husband
impending
ruin
she
could
not
deny
that
some
kind
of
change
had
arisen
in
him
since
that
event
he
had
always
drunk
a
good
deal
in
his
slow
quiet
manner
which
impressed
people
unacquainted
with
his
habits
with
a
notion
of
his
sobriety
even
when
he
was
steadily
emptying
the
bottle
before
him
but
he
drank
more
now
and
sat
longer
over
his
drink
and
there
was
an
aspect
of
trouble
and
uneasiness
about
him
at
times
which
fairly
puzzled
his
wife
of
course
the
most
natural
solution
for
all
this
was
the
one
offered
by
the
dismally
prophetic
tadman
stephen
whitelaw
had
been
speculating
or
gambling
and
his
affairs
were
in
disorder
he
was
not
a
man
to
be
affected
by
anything
but
the
most
sordid
considerations
one
would
suppose
say
that
he
had
lost
money
and
there
you
had
a
key
to
the
whole
he
got
into
a
habit
of
sitting
up
at
night
after
the
rest
of
the
household
had
gone
to
bed
he
had
done
this
more
or
less
from
the
time
of
his
marriage
and
tadman
had
told
ellen
that
the
habit
was
one
which
had
arisen
within
the
last
few
months
he
would
always
see
to
the
fastenings
of
the
house
with
his
own
eyes
tadman
said
but
up
to
last
autumn
he
used
to
go
upstairs
with
me
and
the
servants
it
a
new
thing
for
him
to
sit
up
drinking
his
glass
of
grog
in
the
parlour
by
himself
the
new
habit
seemed
to
grow
upon
whitelaw
more
rapidly
after
that
visit
of
the
stranger
he
took
to
sitting
up
till
midnight
an
awful
hour
in
a
and
ellen
generally
found
the
empty
in
the
morning
night
after
night
he
went
to
bed
soddened
with
drink
once
when
his
kinswoman
made
some
feeble
remonstrance
with
him
about
this
change
in
his
habits
he
told
her
savagely
to
hold
her
tongue
he
could
afford
to
drink
as
much
as
he
pleased
he
was
likely
to
come
upon
to
pay
for
what
he
took
as
for
his
wife
she
unhappily
cared
nothing
what
he
did
he
could
not
become
more
obnoxious
to
her
than
he
had
been
from
the
first
hour
of
her
acquaintance
with
him
let
him
do
what
he
would
little
by
little
finding
no
other
explanation
possible
whitelaw
grew
to
believe
quite
firmly
in
the
supernatural
nature
of
that
unforgotten
cry
she
remembered
the
unexplainable
footstep
which
she
had
heard
in
the
padlocked
room
in
the
early
dusk
of
that
when
tadman
and
she
explored
the
old
house
and
she
associated
these
two
sounds
in
her
mind
as
of
a
like
ghostly
character
from
this
time
forward
she
shrank
with
a
nervous
terror
from
that
darksome
passage
leading
to
the
padlocked
door
at
the
end
of
the
house
she
had
never
any
occasion
to
go
in
this
direction
the
rooms
in
this
wing
were
low
dark
and
small
and
had
been
unused
for
years
it
was
scarcely
any
wonder
if
rats
had
congregated
behind
the
wainscot
to
scare
nervous
listeners
with
their
weird
scratchings
and
scramblings
but
no
one
could
convince
ellen
whitelaw
that
the
sounds
she
had
heard
on
were
produced
by
anything
so
earthly
as
a
rat
with
that
willingness
to
believe
in
a
romantic
impossibility
rather
than
in
a
commonplace
improbability
so
natural
to
the
human
mind
she
was
more
ready
to
conceive
the
existence
of
a
ghost
than
that
her
own
sense
of
hearing
might
have
been
less
powerful
than
her
fancy
about
the
footsteps
she
was
quite
as
positive
as
she
was
about
the
scream
and
in
the
last
instance
she
had
the
evidence
of
tadman
senses
to
support
her
she
was
surprised
to
find
one
day
when
the
household
drudge
martha
holden
had
been
cleaning
the
passage
and
rooms
in
that
deserted
wing
a
task
very
seldom
performed
that
the
girl
had
the
same
aversion
to
that
part
of
the
house
which
she
felt
herself
but
of
which
she
had
never
spoken
in
the
presence
of
the
servants
if
it
was
for
tadman
driving
and
worrying
after
me
all
the
time
i
at
work
i
do
think
i
could
stay
there
mum
martha
told
her
mistress
it
is
often
i
like
to
be
fidgetted
and
followed
but
anything
better
than
being
alone
in
that
unked
place
it
rather
dark
and
dreary
certainly
martha
ellen
answered
with
an
admirable
assumption
of
indifference
but
as
we
have
any
of
us
got
to
live
there
that
does
much
matter
it
is
that
mum
i
would
mind
the
darkness
and
the
dreariness
and
i
sure
such
a
place
for
spiders
i
never
did
see
in
my
life
there
was
one
as
i
took
down
with
my
broom
and
scrunched
as
big
as
a
small
crab
but
it
worse
than
that
the
place
is
haunted
who
told
you
that
sarah
batts
sarah
batts
why
how
should
she
know
anything
about
it
she
has
been
here
so
long
as
you
and
she
came
straight
from
the
workhouse
i
think
master
must
have
told
her
mum
your
master
would
never
have
said
anything
so
foolish
i
know
that
does
believe
in
ghosts
and
he
keeps
all
his
in
the
locked
room
at
the
end
of
the
passage
so
he
must
go
there
sometimes
himself
o
yes
mum
i
know
that
master
goes
there
i
seen
him
go
that
way
at
night
with
a
candle
well
you
silly
girl
he
would
use
the
room
if
he
thought
it
was
haunted
would
he
there
are
plenty
more
empty
rooms
in
the
house
i
do
know
about
that
i
sure
mum
but
anyhow
i
know
sarah
batts
told
me
that
passage
was
haunted
you
never
go
there
martha
she
says
you
want
to
have
your
blood
froze
i
heard
things
there
that
have
froze
mine
and
i
never
should
go
mum
if
it
was
for
moth
tadman
worrying
and
driving
about
the
place
being
cleaned
once
in
a
way
and
sarah
batts
is
right
mum
however
she
may
have
got
to
know
it
for
i
have
heard
things
what
things
moaning
and
groaning
like
as
if
it
was
some
one
in
pain
but
all
very
low
and
i
never
could
make
out
where
it
came
from
but
as
to
the
place
being
haunted
i
no
more
doubt
about
it
than
about
my
catechism
but
martha
you
ought
to
know
it
very
silly
and
wicked
to
believe
in
such
things
ellen
whitelaw
said
feeling
it
her
duty
to
lecture
the
girl
a
little
and
yet
half
inclined
to
believe
her
the
moanings
and
groanings
as
you
call
them
were
only
sounds
made
by
the
wind
i
daresay
o
dear
no
mum
martha
answered
shaking
her
head
in
a
decided
manner
the
wind
never
made
such
noises
as
heard
but
i
do
want
to
make
you
nervous
mum
only
i
sooner
lose
a
month
wages
than
stay
for
an
hour
alone
in
the
west
wing
it
was
strange
certainly
a
matter
of
no
importance
perhaps
this
idle
belief
of
a
servant
these
sounds
which
harmed
no
one
and
yet
all
these
circumstances
worried
and
perplexed
ellen
whitelaw
having
so
little
else
to
think
of
she
brooded
upon
them
incessantly
and
was
gradually
getting
into
a
low
nervous
way
if
she
complained
which
she
did
very
rarely
there
was
no
one
to
sympathise
with
her
tadman
had
so
many
ailments
of
her
own
such
complicated
maladies
such
disorders
that
she
could
be
scarcely
expected
to
give
much
attention
to
the
trivial
sufferings
of
another
person
ah
my
dear
she
would
exclaim
with
a
groan
if
ellen
ventured
to
complain
of
a
racking
headache
when
you
lived
as
long
as
i
have
and
gone
through
what
i
gone
through
and
have
got
such
a
liver
as
got
you
know
what
bad
health
means
but
at
your
age
and
with
your
constitution
it
nothing
more
than
fancy
and
then
tadman
would
branch
off
into
a
graphic
description
of
her
own
maladies
to
which
ellen
was
fain
to
listen
patiently
wondering
vaguely
as
she
listened
whether
the
lapse
of
years
would
render
her
as
wearisome
a
person
as
tadman
she
had
no
sympathy
from
anyone
her
father
came
to
wyncomb
farm
once
a
week
or
so
and
sat
drinking
and
smoking
with
whitelaw
but
ellen
never
saw
him
alone
he
seemed
carefully
to
avoid
the
chance
of
being
alone
with
her
guiltily
conscious
of
his
part
in
the
contriving
of
her
marriage
and
fearing
to
hear
some
complaint
about
her
lot
he
pretended
to
take
it
for
granted
that
her
fate
was
entirely
happy
congratulated
her
frequently
upon
her
prosperity
and
reminded
her
continually
that
it
was
a
fine
thing
to
be
the
sole
mistress
of
the
house
she
lived
in
instead
of
a
mere
servant
as
he
himself
was
and
as
she
had
been
at
the
grange
labouring
for
the
profit
of
other
people
up
to
this
time
carley
had
had
some
reason
to
be
disappointed
with
the
result
of
his
daughter
marriage
so
far
as
his
own
prosperity
was
affected
thereby
not
a
sixpence
beyond
that
one
advance
of
the
two
hundred
pounds
had
the
bailiff
been
able
to
extort
from
his
it
was
the
price
that
whitelaw
had
paid
for
his
wife
and
he
meant
to
pay
no
more
he
told
william
carley
as
much
one
day
when
the
question
of
money
matters
was
pushed
rather
too
far
told
him
in
the
plainest
language
this
was
hard
but
that
two
hundred
pounds
had
saved
the
bailiff
from
imminent
destruction
he
was
obliged
to
be
satisfied
with
this
advantage
and
to
bide
his
time
i
have
it
out
of
the
mean
hound
sooner
or
later
he
muttered
to
himself
as
he
walked
homewards
after
a
social
evening
with
the
master
of
wyncomb
one
evening
carley
brought
his
daughter
a
letter
it
was
from
gilbert
fenton
who
was
quite
unaware
of
ellen
marriage
and
had
written
to
her
at
the
grange
this
letter
afforded
her
the
only
pleasure
she
had
known
since
fate
had
united
her
to
stephen
whitelaw
it
told
her
that
marian
holbrook
was
living
and
in
all
probability
safe
though
by
no
means
in
good
hands
she
had
sailed
for
america
with
her
father
but
her
husband
was
in
hot
pursuit
of
her
and
her
husband
was
faithful
i
have
schooled
myself
to
forgive
him
gilbert
went
on
to
say
for
i
know
that
he
loves
her
and
that
must
needs
condone
my
wrongs
i
look
forward
anxiously
to
their
return
from
america
and
hope
for
a
happy
reunion
amongst
us
all
when
your
warm
friendship
shall
not
be
forgotten
i
am
waiting
impatiently
for
news
from
new
york
and
will
write
to
you
again
directly
i
hear
anything
definite
we
have
suffered
the
torments
of
suspense
for
a
long
weary
time
but
i
trust
and
believe
that
the
sky
is
clearing
this
was
not
much
but
it
was
more
than
enough
to
relieve
ellen
mind
of
a
heavy
load
her
dear
young
lady
as
she
called
marian
was
not
dead
not
lying
at
the
bottom
of
that
cruel
river
at
which
ellen
had
often
looked
with
a
shuddering
horror
of
late
thinking
of
what
might
be
she
was
safe
and
would
no
doubt
be
happy
this
was
something
amid
the
wreck
of
her
own
fortunes
ellen
whitelaw
was
unselfish
enough
to
rejoice
in
this
her
husband
asked
to
see
fenton
letter
which
he
spelt
over
with
his
usual
deliberate
air
and
which
seemed
to
interest
him
more
than
ellen
would
have
supposed
likely
knowing
as
she
did
how
deeply
he
had
resented
marian
encouragement
of
frank
randall
courtship
so
she
gone
to
america
with
her
father
has
she
he
said
when
he
had
perused
the
document
twice
i
should
have
thought
anybody
could
have
persuaded
her
to
leave
that
precious
husband
of
hers
and
she
gone
off
to
america
and
he
after
her
that
rather
a
queer
start
ai
it
nell
whitelaw
did
not
care
to
discuss
the
business
with
her
husband
there
was
something
in
his
tone
a
kind
of
veiled
malice
which
made
her
angry
i
do
suppose
you
care
whether
she
alive
or
dead
she
said
impatiently
so
you
need
trouble
yourself
to
talk
about
her
need
i
o
she
too
grand
a
person
to
be
talked
of
by
such
as
me
is
she
never
mind
nell
do
be
cross
and
when
holbrook
comes
back
to
england
you
shall
go
and
see
her
i
will
answered
ellen
if
i
have
to
walk
to
london
to
do
it
o
but
you
walk
you
shall
go
by
rail
i
spare
you
the
money
for
that
for
once
in
a
way
though
i
not
over
fond
of
wasting
money
day
by
day
whitelaw
habits
grew
more
secluded
and
morose
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
he
was
troubled
by
those
finer
feelings
which
might
have
made
the
misery
of
a
better
man
but
even
in
his
dull
nature
there
may
have
been
some
dim
sense
that
his
marriage
was
a
failure
and
mistake
that
in
having
his
own
way
in
this
matter
he
had
in
nowise
secured
his
own
happiness
he
could
not
complain
of
his
wife
conduct
in
any
one
respect
she
was
obedient
to
his
will
in
all
things
providing
for
his
comfort
with
scrupulous
regularity
industrious
indefatigable
even
as
a
housekeeper
and
partner
of
his
fortunes
no
man
could
have
desired
a
better
wife
yet
dimly
in
that
sluggish
soul
there
was
the
consciousness
that
he
had
married
a
woman
who
hated
him
that
he
had
bought
her
with
a
price
and
being
a
man
prone
to
think
the
worst
of
his
whitelaw
believed
that
sooner
or
later
his
wife
meant
to
have
her
revenge
upon
him
somehow
she
was
waiting
for
his
death
perhaps
calculating
that
being
so
much
her
senior
and
a
man
he
would
die
soon
enough
to
leave
her
a
young
widow
and
then
of
course
she
would
marry
frank
randall
and
all
the
money
which
he
stephen
had
amassed
by
the
sacrifice
of
every
pleasure
in
life
would
enrich
that
supercilious
young
coxcomb
it
was
a
hard
thing
to
think
of
and
stephen
pondered
upon
the
expediency
of
letting
off
wyncomb
farm
and
sinking
all
his
savings
in
the
purchase
of
an
annuity
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
contemplate
selling
the
house
and
lands
that
had
belonged
to
his
race
for
so
many
generations
he
clung
to
the
estate
not
from
any
romantic
reverence
for
the
past
not
from
any
sentimental
associations
connected
with
those
who
had
gone
before
him
but
from
the
mere
force
of
habit
which
rendered
this
grim
ugly
old
house
and
these
flat
shelterless
fields
dearer
to
him
than
all
the
rest
of
the
universe
he
was
a
man
to
whom
to
part
with
anything
was
agony
and
if
he
loved
anything
in
the
world
he
loved
wyncomb
the
possession
of
the
place
had
given
him
importance
for
twenty
years
past
he
could
not
fancy
himself
unconnected
with
wyncomb
his
labours
had
improved
the
estate
too
and
he
could
not
endure
to
think
how
some
lucky
purchaser
might
profit
by
his
prudence
and
sagacity
there
had
been
some
fine
old
oaks
on
the
land
when
he
inherited
it
all
mercilessly
at
the
beginning
of
his
reign
there
had
been
tall
straggling
hedgerows
all
of
a
tangle
with
blackberry
bushes
ferns
and
hazel
and
sloe
trees
all
done
away
with
by
his
order
no
he
could
never
bring
himself
to
sell
wyncomb
nor
was
the
purchase
of
an
annuity
a
transaction
which
he
was
inclined
to
accomplish
it
was
a
pleasing
notion
certainly
that
idea
of
concentrating
all
his
hoarded
money
upon
the
remaining
years
of
his
life
retiring
from
the
toils
of
agriculture
and
giving
himself
up
for
the
rest
of
his
days
to
an
existence
of
luxurious
idleness
but
on
the
other
hand
it
would
be
a
bitter
thing
to
surrender
his
money
for
the
poor
return
of
an
income
to
deprive
himself
of
all
opportunity
of
speculating
and
increasing
his
store
so
the
annuity
scheme
lay
dormant
in
his
brain
as
it
were
for
the
time
being
it
was
something
to
have
in
reserve
and
to
carry
out
any
day
that
his
wife
gave
him
fair
cause
to
doubt
her
fidelity
in
the
mean
time
he
went
on
living
his
lonely
sulky
kind
of
life
drinking
a
great
deal
more
than
was
good
for
him
in
his
own
churlish
manner
and
laughing
to
scorn
any
attempt
at
remonstrance
from
his
wife
or
tadman
some
few
times
ellen
had
endeavoured
to
awaken
him
to
the
evil
consequences
that
must
needs
ensue
from
his
intemperate
habits
feeling
that
it
would
be
a
sin
on
her
part
to
suffer
him
to
go
on
without
some
effort
to
check
him
but
her
warnings
had
been
worse
than
useless

whitelaw
makes
an
end
of
the
mystery
whitelaw
had
been
married
about
two
months
it
was
bright
may
weather
bright
but
not
yet
warm
and
whatever
prettiness
wyncomb
farm
was
capable
of
assuming
had
been
put
on
with
the
fresh
spring
green
of
the
fields
and
the
young
leaves
of
the
poplars
there
were
even
a
few
hardy
flowers
in
the

the
house
humble
perennials
planted
by
dead
and
gone
whitelaws
which
had
bloomed
year
after
year
in
spite
of
stephen

principles
it
was
a

household
work
was
finished
and
ellen
was
sitting
with
tadman
in
the
parlour
where
those
two
spent
so
many
weary
hours
of
their
lives
the
tedium
whereof
was
relieved
only
by
woman
homely
resource
needlework
even
if
whitelaw
had
been
fond
of
reading
and
she
only
cared
moderately
for
that
form
of
occupation
she
could
hardly
have
found
intellectual
diversion
of
that
kind
at
wyncomb
where
a
family
bible
a
few
volumes
of
the
which
had
belonged
to
some
different
owners
before
they
came
from
a
stall
in
malsham
market
to
the
house
of
whitelaw
a
old
quarto
upon
domestic
medicine
and
a
formed
the
entire
library
when
the
duties
of
the
day
were
done
and
the
local
weekly
newspaper
had
been
read
an
intellectual
refreshment
which
might
be
fairly
exhausted
in
ten
minutes
there
remained
nothing
to
beguile
the
hours
but
the
perpetual
stitch
stitch
stitch
of
an
sempstress
and
the
two
women
used
to
sit
throughout
the
long
afternoons
with
their
before
them
talking
a
little
now
and
then
of
the
most
commonplace
matters
but
for
the
greater
part
of
their
time
silent
sometimes
when
the
heavy
burden
of
tadman
society
and
the
clicking
of
needles
and
snipping
of
scissors
grew
almost
unendurable
ellen
would
run
out
of
the
house
for
a
brief
airing
in
the
garden
and
walk
briskly
to
and
fro
along
the
narrow
pathway
between
the
potatoes
and
cabbages
thinking
of
her
dismal
life
and
of
the
old
days
at
the
grange
when
she
had
been
full
of
gaiety
and
hope
there
was
not
perhaps
much
outward
difference
in
the
two
lives
in
her
father
house
she
had
worked
as
hard
as
she
worked
now
but
she
had
been
free
in
those
days
and
the
unknown
future
all
before
her
with
its
chances
of
happiness
now
she
felt
like
some
captive
who
paces
the
narrow
bounds
of
his
without
hope
of
release
or
respite
except
in
death
this
particular
spring
day
had
begun
brightly
the
morning
had
been
sunny
and
even
warm
but
now
as
the
afternoon
wore
away
there
were
dark
clouds
with
a
rising
wind
and
a
sharp
gusty
shower
every
now
and
then
ellen
took
a
solitary
turn
in
the
garden
between
the
showers
it
was
stephen
whitelaw
was
not
expected
home
till
and
the
meal
was
to
be
eaten
at
a
later
hour
than
usual
the
rain
increased
as
the
time
for
the
farmer
return
drew
nearer
he
had
gone
out
in
the
morning
without
his
overcoat
tadman
remembered
and
was
likely
to
get
wet
through
on
his
way
home
unless
he
should
have
borrowed
some
extra
covering
at
malsham
his
temper
which
of
late
had
been
generally
at
its
worst
would
hardly
be
improved
by
this
annoyance
there
was
a
very
substantial
meal
waiting
for
him
a
ponderous
joint
of
cold
roast
beef
a
dish
of
ham
and
eggs
preparing
in
the
kitchen
with
an
agreeable
frizzling
sound
a
pile
of
hot
buttered
cakes
kept
hot
upon
the
oven
top
but
there
was
no
fire
in
the
parlour
and
the
room
looked
a
little
cheerless
in
spite
of
the
table
they
had
discontinued
fires
for
about
a
fortnight
at
whitelaw
command
he
did
want
to
be
ruined
by
his
bill
if
it
was
a
chilly
spring
he
told
his
household
and
at
his
own
bidding
the
had
been
polished
and
garnished
for
the
summer
but
this
evening
was
colder
than
any
evening
lately
by
reason
of
that
blusterous
rising
wind
which
blew
the
against
the
with
as
sharp
a
rattle
as
if
they
had
been
hailstones
and
whitelaw
coming
in
presently
disconsolate
and
dripping
was
by
no
means
inclined
to
abide
by
his
own
decision
about
the
fires
why
the
have
you
got
a
fire
here
he
demanded
savagely
it
was
your
own
wish
stephen
answered
tadman
my
own
fiddlesticks
of
course
i
did
care
to
see
my
wood
and
coals
burning
to
waste
when
the
sun
was
shining
enough
to
melt
any
one
but
when
a
man
comes
home
wet
to
the
skin
he
does
want
to
come
into
a
room
like
an
call
the
girl
and
tell
her
to
light
a
blazing
fire
while
i
go
and
change
my
clothes
let
her
bring
plenty
of
wood
and
put
a
couple
of
logs
on
top
of
the
coals
i
frozen
to
the
very
bones
driving
home
in
the
rain
tadman
gave
a
plaintive
sigh
as
she
departed
to
obey
her
kinsman
that
just
like
stephen
she
said
if
it
was
you
or
me
that
wanted
a
fire
we
might
die
of
cold
before
we
got
leave
to
light
one
but
he
never
grudges
anything
for
his
own
comfort
martha
came
and
lighted
a
fire
under
tadman
direction
that
lady
was
inclined
to
look
somewhat
uneasily
upon
the
operation
for
the
grate
had
been
used
constantly
throughout
a
long
winter
and
the
chimney
had
not
been
swept
since
last
spring
whereby
tadman
was
conscious
of
a
great
accumulation
of
soot
about
the
massive
old
brickwork
and
ponderous
beams
that
spanned
the
wide
chimney
she
had
sent
for
the
malsham
sweep
some
weeks
ago
but
that
necessary
individual
had
not
been
able
to
come
on
the
particular
day
she
wished
and
the
matter
had
been
since
then
neglected
she
remembered
this
now
with
a
guilty
feeling
more
especially
as
stephen
had
demanded
a
blazing
fire
with
flaring
piled
up
the
chimney
he
came
back
to
the
parlour
presently
arrayed
in
an
old
suit
of
clothes
which
he
kept
for
such
occasions
an
old
green
coat
with
basket
buttons
and
a
pair
of
plaid
trousers
of
an
exploded
shape
and
pattern
and
looking
more
like
a
pinched
and
pallid
scarecrow
than
a
farmer
tadman
had
only
carried
out
his
commands
in
a
modified
degree
and
he
immediately
ordered
the
servant
to
put
a
couple
of
logs
on
the
fire
and
then
drew
the
table
close
up
to
the
hearth
and
sat
down
to
his
tea
with
some
appearance
of
satisfaction
he
had
had
rather
a
good
day
at
market
he
condescended
to
tell
his
wife
during
the
progress
of
the
meal
prices
were
rising
his
old
hay
was
selling
at
a
rate
which
promised
well
for
the
new
crops
turnips
were
in
brisk
demand
mangold
enquired
for
altogether
whitelaw
confessed
himself
very
well
satisfied
with
the
aspect
of
affairs
after
tea
he
spent
his
evening
luxuriantly
sitting
close
to
the
fire
with
his
slippered
feet
upon
the
fender
and
drinking
hot
as
a
preventive
of
impending
or
cure
of
incipient
cold
the
being
a
novelty
something
out
of
the
usual
order
of
his
drink
appeared
to
have
an
enlivening
effect
upon
him
he
talked
more
than
usual
and
even
proposed
a
game
at
cribbage
with
tadman
a
condescension
which
moved
that
matron
to
tears
reminding
her
she
said
of
old
times
when
they
had
been
so
comfortable
together
before
he
had
taken
to
spend
his
evenings
at
the
grange
not
that
i
mean
any
unkindness
to
you
ellen
the
doleful
tadman
added
apologetically
for
you
been
a
good
friend
to
me
and
if
there
one
merit
i
can
lay
claim
to
it
a
grateful
heart
but
of
course
when
a
man
marries
he
never
is
the
same
to
his
relations
as
when
he
was
single
it
is
in
human
nature
that
he
should
be
here
tadman
amiable
kinsman
requested
her
to
hold
her
jaw
and
to
bring
the
board
if
she
was
going
to
play
or
to
say
as
much
if
she
was
urged
by
this
gentle
reminder
tadman
immediately
produced
a
somewhat
pack
of
cards
and
a
queer
little
the
game
lasted
for
about
an
hour
or
so
at
the
end
of
which
time
the
farmer
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
with
a
yawn
and
pronounced
that
he
had
had
enough
of
it
the
old
clock
in
the
lobby
struck
ten
soon
after
this
and
the
two
women
rose
to
retire
leaving
stephen
to
his
night
libations
and
not
sorry
to
escape
out
of
the
room
which
he
had
converted
into
a
kind
of
oven
or
turkish
bath
by
means
of
the
roaring
fire
he
had
insisted
upon
keeping
up
all
the
evening
he
was
left
therefore
with
his
bottle
of
rum
about
half
emptied
to
finish
his
night
entertainment
after
his
own
fashion
tadman
ventured
a
mild
warning
about
the
fire
when
she
wished
him
good
night
but
as
she
did
not
dare
to
hint
that
there
had
been
any
neglect
in
the
her
counsel
went
for
very
little
whitelaw
threw
on
another
directly
the
two
women
had
left
him
and
addressed
himself
to
the
consumption
of
a
fresh
glass
of
there
nothing
like
being
on
the
safe
side
he
muttered
to
himself
with
an
air
of
profound
wisdom
i
do
want
to
be
laid
up
with
the
rheumatics
if
i
can
help
it
he
finished
the
contents
of
his
glass
and
went
softly
out
of
the
room
carrying
a
candle
with
him
he
was
absent
about
ten
minutes
and
then
came
back
to
resume
his
comfortable
seat
by
the
fire
and
mixed
himself
another
glass
of
grog
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
likely
to
finish
the
bottle
while
he
sat
drinking
in
his
slow
sensual
way
his
young
wife
slept
peacefully
enough
in
one
of
the
rooms
above
him
early
rising
and
industrious
habits
will
bring
sleep
even
when
the
heart
is
hopeless
and
the
mind
is
weary
whitelaw
slept
a
tranquil
dreamless
sleep
while
tadman
snored
with
a
healthy
regularity
in
a
room
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
passage
there
was
a
faint
glimmer
of
dawn
in
the
sky
a
cold
wet
dawn
when
ellen
was
awakened
suddenly
by
a
sound
that
bewildered
and
alarmed
her
it
was
almost
like
the
report
of
a
pistol
she
thought
as
she
sprang
out
of
bed
pale
and
trembling
it
was
not
a
pistol
shot
however
only
a
handful
of
gravel
thrown
sharply
against
her
window
stephen
she
cried
half
awake
and
very
much
frightened
what
was
that
but
to
her
surprise
she
found
that
her
husband
was
not
in
the
room
while
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
hurrying
some
of
her
clothes
on
half
mechanically
and
wondering
what
that
startling
sound
could
have
been
a
sudden
glow
of
red
light
shone
in
at
her
window
and
at
the
same
moment
her
senses
which
had
been
only
half
awakened
before
told
her
that
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
smoke
in
the
room
she
rushed
to
the
door
forgetting
that
to
open
it
was
perhaps
to
admit
death
and
flung
it
open
yes
the
passage
was
full
of
smoke
and
there
was
a
strange
crackling
sound
below
there
could
be
little
doubt
as
to
what
had
happened
the
house
was
on
fire
she
remembered
how
repeatedly
tadman
had
declared
that
stephen
would
inevitably
set
the
place
on
fire
some
night
or
other
and
how
little
weight
she
had
attached
to
the
dismal
prophecy
but
the
fears
had
not
been
groundless
it
seemed
the
threatened
calamity
had
come
stephen
she
cried
with
all
her
might
and
then
flew
to
door
and
knocked
violently
she
waited
for
no
answer
but
rushed
on
to
the
room
where
the
two
slept
together
and
called
to
them
loudly
to
get
up
for
their
lives
the
house
was
on
fire
there
were
still
the
men
in
the
story
above
to
be
awakened
and
the
smoke
was
every
moment
growing
thicker
she
mounted
a
few
steps
of
the
staircase
and
called
with
all
her
strength
it
was
very
near
their
time
for
stirring
they
must
hear
her
surely
suddenly
she
remembered
an
old
disused
which
hung
in
the
roof
she
had
seen
the
frayed
rope
belonging
to
it
hanging
in
an
angle
of
the
passage
she
flew
to
this
and
pulled
it
vigorously
till
a
shrill
peal
rang
out
above
and
once
having
accomplished
this
she
went
on
reckless
of
her
own
safety
thinking
only
how
many
there
were
to
be
saved
in
that
house
all
this
time
there
was
no
sign
of
her
husband
and
a
dull
horror
came
over
her
with
the
thought
that
he
might
be
perishing
miserably
below
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
fire
came
from
downstairs
that
crackling
noise
had
increased
and
every
now
and
then
there
came
a
sound
like
the
breaking
of
glass
the
red
glow
shining
in
at
the
front
windows
grew
deeper
and
brighter
the
fire
had
begun
in
the
parlour
of
course
where
they
had
left
stephen
whitelaw
basking
in
the
warmth
of
his
resinous
ellen
was
still
ringing
the
bell
when
she
heard
a
man
footstep
coming
along
the
passage
towards
her
it
was
not
her
husband
but
one
of
the
from
the
upper
story
an
honest
fellow
as
strong
as
hercules
lord
a
mercy
mum
be
that
you
he
cried
as
he
recognised
the
white
figure
clinging
to
the
let
me
get
out
this
the
old
place
burn
like
so
much
tinder
and
before
she
could
object
he
had
taken
her
up
in
his
arms
as
easily
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
and
was
carrying
her
towards
the
principal
staircase
here
they
were
stopped
the
flames
and
smoke
were
mounting
from
the
lobby
below
the
man
turned
immediately
wasting
no
time
by
indecision
and
ran
to
the
stairs
leading
down
to
the
kitchen
in
this
direction
all
was
safe
there
was
smoke
but
in
a
very
modified
degree
robert
ellen
cried
eagerly
when
they
had
reached
the
kitchen
where
all
was
quiet
for
god
sake
go
and
see
what
has
become
of
your
master
we
left
him
drinking
in
the
parlour
last
night
i
called
to
him
again
and
again
but
there
been
no
answer
do
you
take
on
mum
master
all
right
i
daresay
here
be
the
gals
and
tadman
coming
downstairs
they
take
care
o
you
while
i
go
and
look
arter
him
you
no
call
to
be
frightened
if
the
fire
should
come
this
way
you
only
got
to
open
yon
door
and
get
out
into
the
yard
you
safe
here
the
women
were
all
huddled
together
in
the
kitchen
by
this
time
half
dressed
shivering
and
frightened
out
of
their
wits
ellen
whitelaw
was
the
only
one
among
them
who
displayed
anything
like
calmness
the
men
were
all
astir
one
had
run
across
the
fields
to
malsham
to
summon
the
another
was
gone
to
remove
some
animals
stabled
near
the
house
the
noise
of
burning
wood
was
rapidly
increasing
the
smoke
came
creeping
under
the
presently
and
five
minutes
after
he
had
left
them
the
came
back
to
say
that
he
could
find
no
traces
of
his
master
the
parlor
was
in
flames
if
he
had
been
surprised
by
the
fire
in
his
sleep
it
must
needs
be
all
over
with
him
the
man
urged
his
mistress
to
get
out
of
the
house
at
once
the
fire
was
gaining
ground
rapidly
and
it
was
not
likely
that
anything
he
or
the
other
men
could
do
would
stop
its
progress
the
women
left
the
kitchen
immediately
upon
this
warning
by
a
door
leading
into
the
yard
it
was
broad
daylight
by
this
time
a
chilly
sunless
morning
and
a
high
wind
sweeping
across
the
fields
and
fanning
the
flames
which
now
licked
the
front
wall
of
wyncomb
farmhouse
the
total
destruction
of
the
place
seemed
inevitable
unless
help
from
malsham
came
very
quickly
the
farm
servants
were
running
to
and
fro
with
buckets
of
water
from
the
yard
and
flinging
their
contents
in
at
the
shattered
windows
of
the
front
rooms
but
this
was
a
small
means
of
checking
the
destruction
the
house
was
old
built
for
the
most
part
of
wood
and
there
seemed
little
hope
for
it
ellen
and
the
other
women
went
round
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
stood
there
dismal
figures
in
their
scanty
raiment
with
woollen
petticoats
pinned
across
their
shoulders
and
disordered
hair
blown
about
their
faces
by
the
damp
wind
they
stood
grouped
together
in
utter
helplessness
looking
at
the
work
of
ruin
with
a
air
almost
like
the
animals
who
had
been
hustled
from
one
place
of
shelter
to
another
and
were
evidently
lost
in
wonder
as
to
the
cause
of
their
removal
but
presently
as
the
awful
scene
before
them
grew
more
familiar
the
instincts
of
arose
in
each
breast
tadman
piteously
bewailed
the
loss
of
her
entire
wardrobe
and
some
mysterious
which
she
described
plaintively
as
her
little
all
she
dwelt
dolefully
upon
the
merits
of
each
particular
article
most
especially
upon
a
dress
she
had
bought
for
stephen
wedding
which
would
have
lasted
her
a
lifetime
and
a
paisley
shawl
the
gift
of
her
deceased
husband
which
had
been
in
her
possession
twenty
years
and
had
not
so
much
as
a
thin
place
in
it
nor
was
the
disconsolate
matron
the
only
one
who
lamented
her
losses
sarah
batts
with
clasped
hands
and
distracted
aspect
wept
for
the
destruction
of
her
box
there
was
money
in
it
she
cried
money
oh
do
you
think
the
men
could
get
to
my
room
and
save
it
money
exclaimed
tadman
sharply
aroused
from
the
contemplation
of
her
own
woes
by
this
avowal
you
must
be
cleverer
than
i
took
you
for
sarah
batts
to
be
able
to
save
money
and
yet
be
always
bedizened
with
some
new
bit
of
finery
as
you
been
it
was
give
to
me
sarah
answered
indignantly
by
them
as
had
a
right
to
give
it
for
no
good
i
should
think
replied
tadman
what
should
anybody
give
you
money
for
never
you
mind
it
was
mine
o
dear
o
dear
if
one
of
the
men
would
only
get
my
box
for
me
she
ran
to
intercept
one
of
the
armed
with
his
bucket
and
tried
to
bribe
him
by
the
promise
of
five
shillings
as
a
reward
for
the
rescue
of
her
treasures
but
the
man
only
threatened
to
heave
the
bucket
of
water
at
her
if
she
got
in
his
way
and
miss
batts
was
obliged
to
abandon
this
hope
the
fire
made
rapid
progress
meanwhile
unchecked
by
that
ineffectual
splashing
of
water
it
had
begun
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
building
the
end
most
remote
from
those
disused
rooms
in
the
west
wing
but
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
and
the
flames
were
spreading
rapidly
towards
that
western
angle
there
was
little
chance
that
any
part
of
the
house
could
be
saved
while
ellen
whitelaw
was
looking
on
at
the
work
of
ruin
with
a
sense
of
utter
helplessness
hearing
the
selfish
lamentations
of
tadman
and
sarah
batts
like
voices
in
a
dream
she
was
suddenly
aroused
from
this
state
of
torpor
by
a
loud
groan
which
sounded
from
not
very
far
off
it
came
from
behind
her
from
the
direction
of
the
poplars
she
flew
to
the
spot
and
on
the
ground
beneath
one
of
them
she
found
a
helpless
figure
lying
prostrate
with
an
awful
face
a
figure
and
face
which
for
some
moments
she
did
not
recognize
as
her
husband
she
knew
him
at
last
however
and
knelt
down
beside
him
he
was
groaning
in
an
agonized
manner
and
had
evidently
been
fearfully
burnt
before
he
made
his
escape
stephen
she
cried
o
thank
god
you
are
here
i
thought
you
were
shut
up
in
that
burning
house
i
called
with
all
my
might
and
the
men
searched
for
you
it
is
much
to
be
thankful
for
gasped
the
farmer
i
do
suppose
there
an
hour
life
in
me
i
scorched
from
head
to
foot
and
one
arm
helpless
i
woke
up
all
of
a
sudden
and
found
the
room
in
a
blaze
the
flames
had
burst
out
of
the
great
beam
that
goes
across
the
the
place
was
all
on
fire
so
that
i
could
reach
the
door
anyhow
and
before
i
could
get
out
of
the
window
i
was
burnt
like
this
you
have
been
burnt
alive
in
your
bed
but
for
me
i
threw
up
a
handful
of
gravel
at
your
window
it
must
have
woke
you
did
it
yes
yes
that
was
the
sound
that
woke
me
it
seemed
like
a
pistol
going
off
you
saved
my
life
stephen
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
remember
me
yes
there
men
in
my
place
who
would
have
thought
of
anybody
but
themselves
can
i
do
anything
to
ease
you
stephen
asked
his
wife
she
had
seated
herself
on
the
grass
beside
him
and
had
taken
his
head
on
her
lap
supporting
him
gently
she
was
shocked
to
see
the
change
the
fire
had
made
in
his
face
which
was
all
blistered
and
distorted
no
nothing
till
they
come
to
carry
me
away
somewhere
i
all
one
burning
pain
his
eyes
closed
and
he
seemed
to
sink
into
a
kind
of
stupor
ellen
called
to
one
of
the
men
they
might
carry
him
to
some
place
of
shelter
surely
at
once
where
a
doctor
could
be
summoned
and
something
done
for
his
relief
there
was
a
humble
practitioner
resident
at
crosber
that
is
to
say
about
two
miles
from
wyncomb
one
of
the
might
take
a
horse
and
gallop
across
the
fields
to
fetch
this
man
robert
dunn
the
bailiff
heard
her
cries
presently
and
came
to
her
he
was
very
much
shocked
by
his
master
condition
and
at
once
agreed
to
the
necessity
of
summoning
a
surgeon
he
proposed
that
they
should
carry
stephen
whitelaw
to
some
stables
which
lay
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
burning
house
and
make
up
some
kind
of
bed
for
him
there
he
ran
back
to
dispatch
one
of
the
men
to
crosber
and
returned
immediately
with
another
to
remove
his
master
but
when
they
tried
to
raise
the
injured
man
between
them
he
cried
out
to
them
to
let
him
alone
they
were
murdering
him
let
him
lie
where
he
was
he
would
not
be
moved
so
he
was
allowed
to
lie
there
with
his
head
on
his
wife
lap
and
his
tortured
body
covered
by
a
coat
which
one
of
the
men
brought
him
his
eyes
closed
again
and
for
some
time
he
lay
without
the
slightest
motion
the
fire
was
gaining
ground
every
instant
and
there
was
yet
no
sign
of
the
engine
from
malsham
but
ellen
whitelaw
scarcely
heeded
the
work
of
destruction
she
was
thinking
only
of
the
helpless
stricken
creature
lying
with
his
head
upon
her
lap
thinking
of
him
perhaps
in
this
hour
of
his
extremity
with
all
the
more
compassion
because
he
had
always
been
obnoxious
to
her
she
prayed
for
the
rapid
arrival
of
the
surgeon
who
must
surely
be
able
to
give
some
relief
to
her
husband
sufferings
she
thought
it
seemed
dreadful
for
him
to
be
lying
like
this
with
no
attempt
made
to
lessen
his
agony
after
a
long
interval
he
lifted
his
scorched
eyelids
slowly
and
looked
at
her
with
a
strange
dim
gaze
the
west
wing
he
muttered
is
that
burnt
no
stephen
not
yet
but
there
little
hope
they
save
any
part
of
the
house
they
must
save
that
the
rest
do
matter
i
insured
heavily
but
they
must
save
the
west
wing
his
wife
concluded
from
this
that
he
had
kept
some
of
his
money
in
one
of
those
western
rooms
the
perhaps
that
mysterious
padlocked
chamber
where
she
had
heard
the
footstep
and
yet
she
had
heard
him
say
again
and
again
that
he
never
kept
an
unnecessary
shilling
in
the
house
and
that
every
pound
he
had
was
out
at
interest
but
such
falsehoods
and
contradictions
are
common
enough
amongst
men
of
miserly
habits
and
stephen
whitelaw
would
hardly
be
so
anxious
about
those
western
rooms
unless
something
of
value
were
hidden
away
there
he
closed
his
eyes
again
and
lay
groaning
faintly
for
some
time
then
opened
them
suddenly
with
a
frightened
look
and
asked
in
the
same
tone
the
west
wing
is
the
west
wing
afire
yet
the
wind
blows
that
way
stephen
and
the
flames
are
spreading
i
think
they
could
save
it
not
if
the
engine
was
to
come
this
minute
but
i
tell
you
they
must
cried
stephen
whitelaw
if
they
do
be
murder
murder
o
my
god
i
never
thought
there
was
much
harm
in
the
business
and
it
paid
me
well
but
it
weighed
me
down
like
a
load
of
lead
and
made
me
drink
more
to
drown
thought
but
if
it
should
come
to
this
do
you
understand
do
sit
staring
at
me
like
that
if
the
fire
gets
to
the
west
wing
it
will
be
murder
there
some
one
there
some
one
locked
up
that
wo
be
able
to
stir
unless
they
get
her
out
some
one
locked
up
in
the
west
wing
are
you
mad
stephen
it
the
truth
i
would
do
it
again
no
not
for
twice
the
money
let
them
get
her
out
somehow
they
can
do
it
if
they
look
sharp
that
unforgotten
footstep
and
equally
unforgotten
scream
flashed
into
whitelaw
mind
with
these
words
of
her
husband
some
one
shut
up
there
yes
that
was
the
solution
of
the
mystery
that
had
puzzled
and
tormented
her
so
long
that
cry
of
anguish
was
no
supernatural
echo
of
past
suffering
but
the
despairing
shriek
of
some
victim
of
modern
cruelty
a
poor
relation
of
stephen
perhaps
a
helpless
mindless
creature
whose
infirmities
had
been
thus
hidden
from
the
world
such
things
have
been
too
cruelly
common
in
our
fair
free
country
ellen
laid
her
husband
head
gently
down
upon
the
grass
and
sprang
to
her
feet
in
which
room
she
cried
but
there
was
no
answer
the
man
lay
with
closed
eyes
dying
perhaps
but
she
could
do
nothing
for
him
till
medical
help
came
the
rescue
of
that
unknown
captive
was
a
more
urgent
duty
she
was
running
towards
the
burning
house
when
she
heard
a
horse
galloping
on
the
road
leading
from
the
gate
she
stopped
hoping
that
this
was
the
arrival
of
the
doctor
but
a
familiar
voice
called
to
her
and
in
another
minute
her
father
had
dismounted
and
was
close
at
her
side
thank
god
you
safe
lass
he
exclaimed
with
some
warmer
touch
of
paternal
feeling
than
he
was
accustomed
to
exhibit
our
men
saw
the
fire
when
they
were

much

brain
must
have
been
wandering
who

be
shut
up
there
and
you
live
in
the
house
and
not
know
it
why
should
stephen
hide
any

his
house

motive

he
have
for
such
a
thing
it
is
possible
i
tell
you
father

is
true

no
mistaking
stephen
words

moment

risk
my
life
for
a
fancy

ladder

men

ladders
and
where
this
room
where
you
say
the
woman
is
shut
up
at
that
corner
of
the
house
answered
ellen
pointing
there
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
but
no
window
looking
this
way
there
only
one
and
that
over
the
then
it
would
be
easiest
to
get
in
that
way
no
no
father
the
wood
all
piled
up
above
the
window
it
would
take
such
a
time
to
move
it
never
mind
that
anything
better
than
the
risk
of
going
into
yonder
house
besides
the
room
locked
you
say
have
you
got
the
key
no
but
i
could
get
it
from
stephen
i
daresay
we
wo
wait
for
you
to
try
we
begin
at
the
take
robert
dunn
with
you
father
he
a
good
brave
fellow
yes
i
take
dunn
the
bailiff
hurried
away
to
the
accompanied
by
dunn
and
another
man
carrying
a
tall
ladder
the
had
ceased
from
their
futile
efforts
at
quenching
the
fire
by
this
time
it
was
a
labour
too
hopeless
to
continue
the
flames
had
spread
to
the
west
wing
the
ivy
was
already
crackling
as
the
blaze
crept
over
it
happily
that
room
was
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
building
the
point
to
which
the
flames
must
come
last
and
here
just
at
the
moment
when
the
work
of
devastation
was
almost
accomplished
came
the
malsham
rattling
along
gaily
through
the
dewy
morning
and
the
malsham
amateur
a
very
juvenile
corps
as
yet
eager
to
cover
itself
with
laurels
but
more
careful
in
the
adjustment
of
its
costume
than
was
quite
consistent
with
the
desperate
nature
of
its
duty
here
came
the
brigade
in
time
to
do
something
at
any
rate
and
the
engine
soon
began
to
play
briskly
upon
the
western
wing
ellen
whitelaw
was
in
the
watching
the
work
going
on
there
with
intense
anxiety
the
removal
of
the
wood
pile
seemed
a
slow
business
well
as
the
three
men
performed
their
work
flinging
down
great
crushing
piles
of
wood
one
after
another
without
a
moment
pause
they
were
now
joined
by
the
malsham
men
who
had
got
wind
of
some
one
to
be
rescued
from
this
part
of
the
house
and
were
eager
to
exhibit
the
capabilities
of
a
new
started
with
much
hubbub
and
glorification
after
an
awful
fire
had
ravaged
malsham
and
lives
had
been
wasted
because
the
old
was
out
of
order
and
useless
we
do
want
the
cried
carley
as
the
tall
machine
was
wheeled
into
the
yard
the
room
we
want
to
get
at
is
ten
feet
from
the
ground
you
can
give
us
a
hand
with
this
wood
if
you
like
that
all
we
want
the
men
clambered
on
to
the
it
was
getting
visibly
lower
by
this
time
and
the
top
of
the
window
was
to
be
seen
ellen
watched
with
breathless
anxiety
forgetting
that
her
husband
might
be
dying
under
the
poplars
he
was
not
alone
there
she
had
sent
tadman
to
watch
him
only
a
few
minutes
more
and
the
window
was
cleared
a
pale
face
could
be
dimly
seen
peering
out
through
the
dusty
glass
william
carley
tried
to
open
the
lattice
but
it
was
secured
tightly
within
one
of
the
firemen
leapt
forward
upon
his
failure
and
shattered
every
pane
of
glass
and
every
inch
of
the
leaden
frame
with
a
couple
of
blows
from
his
axe
and
then
the
bailiff
clambered
into
the
room
he
was
hidden
from
those
below
about
five
minutes
and
then
emerged
from
the
window
somehow
or
other
carrying
a
burden
and
came
struggling
across
the
wood
to
the
ladder
by
which
he
and
the
rest
had
mounted
the
burden
which
he
carried
was
a
woman
figure
with
the
face
hidden
by
his
large
woollen
neckerchief
ellen
gave
a
cry
of
horror
the
woman
must
surely
be
dead
or
why
should
he
have
taken
such
pains
to
cover
her
face
he
brought
his
burden
down
the
ladder
very
carefully
and
gave
the
lifeless
figure
into
ellen
arms
help
me
to
carry
her
away
yonder
while
robert
gets
the
cart
ready
he
said
to
his
daughter
she
fainted
and
then
he
added
in
a
whisper
for
god
sake
do
let
any
one
see
her
face
it
mrs
holbrook
chapter
xliv
after
the
fire
yes
it
was
marian
she
whom
gilbert
fenton
had
sought
so
long
and
patiently
with
doubt
and
anguish
in
his
heart
she
whose
double
john
saltram
had
followed
across
the
atlantic
had
been
within
easy
reach
of
them
all
the
time
hidden
away
in
that
dreary
old
the
innocent
victim
of
percival
nowell
treachery
and
stephen
greed
of
gain
the
whole
story
was
told
when
the
master
of
wyncomb
farm
lay
dying
william
carley
and
his
daughter
took
her
to
the
grange
as
soon
as
the
farmer
spring
cart
was
ready
to
convey
her
thither
it
was
all
done
very
quickly
and
none
of
the
saw
her
face
even
if
they
had
done
so
it
is
more
than
doubtful
that
they
would
have
recognised
her
so
pale
a
shadow
of
her
former
self
had
she
become
during
that
long
dreary
imprisonment
the
face
wan
and
wasted
with
a
strange
sharpened
look
about
the
features
which
was
like
the
aspect
of
death
all
the
brightness
and
colour
vanished
out
of
the
soft
brown
hair
an
ashen
pallor
upon
her
beauty
that
made
her
seem
like
a
creature
risen
from
the
grave
they
lifted
her
into
the
cart
still
insensible
and
seated
her
there
wrapped
in
an
old
with
her
head
resting
on
shoulder
and
so
they
drove
slowly
away
it
was
only
when
they
had
gone
some
little
distance
from
the
farm
that
the
fresh
morning
air
revived
her
and
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
about
her
wildly
at
first
and
with
a
faint
shuddering
sigh
then
after
a
few
moments
full
consciousness
came
back
to
her
and
a
sudden
cry
of
rapture
broke
from
the
pale
lips
o
god
she
exclaimed
am
i
set
free
yes
dear
holbrook
you
are
free
never
again
to
go
back
to
that
cruel
place
o
to
think
that
you
should
be
used
so
and
i
so
near
marian
lifted
her
head
from
ellen
shoulder
and
recognised
her
with
a
second
cry
of
delight
ellen
is
it
you
then
i
am
safe
i
must
be
safe
with
you
safe
yes
dear
i
would
die
sooner
than
any
harm
should
come
to
you
again
who
could
have
brought
this
cruelty
about
who
could
have
shut
you
up
in
that
room
my
father
marian
answered
with
a
shudder
he
wanted
my
money
i
suppose
and
instead
of
killing
me
he
shut
me
up
in
that
place
she
said
no
more
just
then
being
too
weak
to
say
much
and
ellen
who
was
employed
in
soothing
and
comforting
her
did
not
want
her
to
talk
it
was
afterwards
when
she
had
been
established
in
her
old
rooms
at
the
grange
and
had
taken
a
little
breakfast
that
she
told
ellen
something
more
about
her
captivity
o
ellen
if
i
were
to
tell
you
what
i
have
suffered
but
no
there
are
no
words
can
tell
that
it
not
that
they
me
the
girl
who
waited
on
me
brought
me
good
food
and
even
tried
to
make
me
comfortable
in
her
rough
way
but
to
sit
there
day
after
day
ellen
alone
with
only
a
dim
light
from
the
top
of
the
window
above
the
to
sit
there
wondering
about
my
husband
whether
he
was
searching
for
me
still
and
would
ever
find
me
or
whether
as
was
more
likely
he
had
given
me
up
for
dead
think
of
me
ellen
if
you
can
sitting
there
for
weeks
and
months
in
my
despair
trying
to
reckon
the
days
sometimes
by
the
aid
of
some
old
newspaper
which
the
girl
brought
me
now
and
then
at
other
times
losing
count
of
them
altogether
dear
holbrook
i
ca
understand
it
even
yet
tell
me
how
it
all
came
about
how
they
ever
lured
you
into
that
place
it
was
easy
enough
ellen
i
was
conscious
when
they
took
me
there
the
story
is
very
short
you
remember
that
day
when
you
left
the
grange
how
happy
i
was
looking
forward
to
my
husband
return
and
thinking
of
the
good
news
i
had
to
tell
him
we
were
to
be
rich
and
our
lives
free
and
peaceful
henceforward
and
i
had
seen
him
suffer
so
much
for
the
want
of
money
it
was
the
morning
after
you
left
when
the
post
brought
me
a
letter
from
my
father
a
letter
with
the
malsham
i
had
seen
him
in
town
as
you
know
and
was
scarcely
surprised
that
he
should
write
to
me
but
i
was
surprised
to
find
him
so
near
me
and
the
contents
of
the
letter
were
very
perplexing
my
father
entreated
me
to
meet
him
on
the
pathway
between
malsham
station
and
this
house
he
had
been
informed
of
my
habits
he
said
and
that
i
was
accustomed
to
walk
there
that
was
curious
when
so
far
as
i
knew
he
had
never
been
near
this
place
but
i
hardly
thought
about
the
strangeness
of
it
then
he
begged
me
so
earnestly
to
see
him
it
was
a
matter
of
life
or
death
he
said
what
could
i
do
nelly
he
was
my
father
and
i
felt
that
i
owed
him
some
duty
i
could
not
refuse
to
see
him
and
if
he
had
some
personal
objection
to
coming
here
it
seemed
a
small
thing
for
me
to
take
the
trouble
to
go
and
meet
him
i
could
but
hear
what
he
had
to
say
i
wish
to
heaven
i
had
been
here
exclaimed
ellen
you
should
have
gone
alone
if
i
had
known
anything
about
it
i
think
if
you
had
been
here
i
should
have
told
you
about
the
letter
for
it
puzzled
me
a
good
deal
and
i
knew
how
well
i
could
trust
you
but
you
were
away
and
my
father
request
was
so
urgent
the
hour
was
named
i
could
do
nothing
but
accede
to
it
so
i
went
leaving
no
message
for
you
or
for
my
husband
feeling
so
sure
of
my
return
within
an
hour
or
two
and
you
found
your
father
waiting
for
you
yes
on
the
within
a
short
distance
of
whitelaw
house
he
began
by
congratulating
me
on
the
change
in
my
prospects
i
was
a
rich
woman
he
said
and
then
he
went
on
to
vilify
my
husband
in
such
hateful
words
ellen
telling
me
that
i
had
married
a
notorious
scoundrel
and
profligate
and
that
he
could
produce
ample
evidence
of
what
he
affirmed
and
all
this
with
a
pretended
pity
for
my
weakness
and
ignorance
of
the
world
i
laughed
his
shameful
slanders
to
scorn
and
told
him
that
i
knew
my
husband
too
thoroughly
to
be
alarmed
even
for
a
moment
by
such
groundless
charges
he
still
affected
to
compassionate
me
as
the
weakest
and
most
credulous
of
women
and
then
came
to
a
proposal
which
he
said
he
had
travelled
to
hampshire
on
purpose
to
make
to
me
it
was
that
i
should
leave
my
husband
and
place
myself
under
his
protection
that
i
should
go
to
america
with
him
when
he
returned
there
and
so
preserve
my
fortune
from
the
clutches
of
a
villain
fortune
i
said
i
see
that
it
is
alone
you
are
thinking
of
how
can
you
suppose
me
so
blind
as
not
to
understand
that
you
had
better
be
candid
with
me
and
say
frankly
what
you
want
i
have
no
doubt
my
husband
will
allow
me
to
make
any
reasonable
sacrifice
in
your
favour
what
did
he
say
to
that
he
laughed
bitterly
at
my
offer
husband
he
said
am
not
likely
to
see
the
colour
of
my
father
money
if
you
are
to
be
governed
by
him
do
him
a
great
wrong
i
answered
am
sure
that
he
will
act
generously
and
i
shall
be
governed
by
him
he
was
very
angry
i
suppose
no
doubt
of
it
but
for
some
time
he
contrived
to
suppress
all
appearance
of
anger
and
urged
me
to
believe
his
statements
about
my
husband
and
to
accept
his
offer
of
a
home
and
protection
with
him
i
can
not
tell
you
how
plausible
his
words
were
what
an
appearance
of
affection
and
interest
in
my
welfare
he
put
on
then
finding
me
firm
he
changed
his
tone
and
there
were
hidden
threats
mixed
with
his
entreaties
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
for
me
if
i
refused
to
go
with
him
he
said
i
would
have
cause
to
repent
my
folly
for
the
rest
of
my
life
he
said
a
great
deal
using
every
argument
it
is
possible
to
imagine
and
there
was
always
the
same
threatening
he
could
not
move
me
in
the
least
as
you
may
fancy
nell
i
told
him
that
nothing
upon
earth
would
induce
me
to
leave
my
husband
or
to
think
ill
of
him
and
in
this
manner
we
walked
up
and
down
for
nearly
two
hours
till
i
began
to
feel
very
tired
and
faint
my
father
saw
this
and
when
we
came
within
sight
of
wyncomb
farmhouse
proposed
that
i
should
go
in
and
rest
and
take
a
glass
of
milk
or
some
kind
of
refreshment
i
was
surprised
at
this
proposal
and
asked
him
if
he
knew
the
people
of
the
house
he
said
yes
he
knew
something
of
whitelaw
he
had
met
him
the
night
before
in
the
of
the
inn
at
malsham
then
your
father
had
slept
at
malsham
the
night
before
evidently
his
letter
to
me
had
been
posted
at
malsham
you
know
i
asked
him
how
long
he
had
been
in
this
part
of
the
country
and
he
rather
evaded
the
question
not
long
he
said
and
he
had
come
down
here
only
to
see
me
at
first
i
refused
to
go
into
whitelaw
house
being
only
anxious
to
get
home
as
quickly
as
possible
but
my
father
seemed
offended
by
this
i
wanted
to
get
rid
of
him
he
said
although
this
was
likely
to
be
our
last
interview
the
very
last
time
in
his
life
that
he
would
ever
see
me
perhaps
i
could
not
surely
grudge
him
half
an
hour
more
of
my
company
i
could
scarcely
go
on
refusing
after
this
and
i
really
felt
so
tired
and
faint
that
i
doubted
my
capability
of
walking
back
to
this
house
without
resting
so
i
said
yes
and
we
went
into
wyncomb
farmhouse
the
door
was
opened
by
a
girl
when
my
father
knocked
there
was
no
one
at
home
she
told
him
but
we
were
quite
welcome
to
sit
down
in
the
parlour
and
she
would
bring
me
a
glass
of
fresh
milk
and
a
slice
of
the
house
had
a
strange
empty
look
i
thought
there
was
none
of
the
life
or
bustle
one
expects
to
see
at
a
farm
all
was
silent
as
the
grave
the
gloom
and
quietness
of
the
place
chilled
me
somehow
there
was
a
fire
burning
in
the
parlour
and
my
father
made
me
sit
down
very
close
to
it
and
i
think
the
heat
increased
that
faintness
which
i
had
felt
when
i
came
into
the
house
again
and
again
he
urged
his
first
demand
seeming
as
if
he
would
wear
down
all
opposition
by
persistence
i
was
quite
firm
but
the
effect
of
all
this
argument
was
very
wearisome
and
i
began
to
feel
really
i
think
i
must
have
been
on
the
point
of
fainting
when
the
door
was
opened
suddenly
and
whitelaw
came
in
in
the
next
moment
while
the
room
was
spinning
round
before
my
eyes
and
that
dreadful
giddiness
that
comes
before
a
dead
faint
was
growing
worse
my
father
snatched
me
up
in
his
arms
and
threw
a
handkerchief
over
my
face
i
had
just
sense
enough
to
know
that
there
was
chloroform
upon
it
and
that
was
all
when
i
opened
my
eyes
again
i
was
lying
on
a
narrow
bed
in
a
room
with
a
small
fire
burning
in
a
rusty
grate
in
one
corner
and
some
with
a
plate
of
cold
meat
on
a
table
near
it
there
was
a
scrap
of
paper
on
this
table
with
a
few
lines
scrawled
upon
it
in
pencil
in
my
father
hand
have
had
your
choice
either
to
share
a
prosperous
life
with
me
or
to
be
shut
up
like
a
mad
woman
you
had
better
make
yourself
as
comfortable
as
you
can
since
you
have
no
hope
of
escape
till
it
suits
my
purpose
to
have
you
set
free
good
care
will
be
taken
of
you
you
must
have
been
a
fool
to
suppose
that
i
would
submit
to
the
injustice
of
will
for
a
long
time
i
sat
like
some
stupid
bewildered
creature
going
over
these
words
again
and
again
as
if
i
had
no
power
to
understand
them
it
was
very
long
before
i
could
believe
that
my
father
meant
to
shut
me
up
in
that
room
for
an
indefinite
time
for
the
rest
of
my
life
perhaps
but
little
by
little
i
came
to
believe
this
and
to
feel
nothing
but
a
blank
despair
o
nelly
i
dare
not
dwell
upon
that
time
i
suffered
too
much
god
has
been
very
merciful
to
me
in
sparing
me
my
mind
for
there
were
times
when
i
believe
i
was
quite
mad
i
could
pray
sometimes
but
not
always
i
have
spent
whole
days
in
prayer
almost
as
if
i
fancied
that
i
could
weary
out
my
god
with
supplications
and
stephen
did
you
see
him
yes
now
and
then
once
in
several
days
in
a
week
perhaps
he
used
to
come
like
the
master
of
a
madhouse
visiting
his
patients
to
see
that
i
was
comfortable
he
said
at
first
i
used
to
appeal
to
him
to
set
me
free
kneeling
at
his
feet
promising
any
sacrifice
of
my
fortune
for
him
or
for
my
father
if
they
would
release
me
but
it
was
no
use
he
was
as
hard
as
a
rock
and
at
last
i
felt
that
it
was
useless
and
used
to
see
him
come
and
go
with
hopeless
apathy
no
ellen
there
are
no
words
can
describe
what
i
suffered
i
appealed
to
the
girl
who
waited
on
me
daily
but
who
came
only
once
and
always
after
dark
i
might
as
well
have
appealed
to
the
four
walls
of
my
room
the
girl
was
utterly
stolid
she
brought
me
everything
i
was
likely
to
want
from
day
to
day
and
gave
me
ample
means
of
replenishing
my
fire
and
told
me
that
i
ought
to
make
myself
comfortable
i
had
a
much
better
life
than
any
one
in
the
workhouse
she
said
and
i
must
be
very
wicked
if
i
complained
i
believe
she
really
thought
i
was
a
harmless
madwoman
and
that
her
master
had
a
right
to
shut
me
up
in
that
room
one
night
after
i
had
been
there
for
a
time
that
seemed
like
eternity
my
father
came
what
cried
ellen
whitelaw
the
stranger
i
understand
that
man
was
your
father
he
came
to
see
you
that
night
and
as
he
was
leaving
you
you
gave
that
dreadful
shriek
we
heard
downstairs
o
if
i
had
known
the
truth
if
i
had
only
known
heard
me
ellen
you
were
there
marian
exclaimed
surprised
she
was
as
yet
entirely
ignorant
of
ellen
marriage
and
had
been
too
much
bewildered
by
the
suddenness
of
her
escape
to
wonder
how
the
daughter
had
happened
to
be
so
near
at
hand
in
that
hour
of
deadly
peril
yes
yes
dear
holbrook
i
was
there
and
i
did
not
help
you
but
never
mind
that
now
tell
me
the
rest
of
your
story
tell
me
how
your
father
acted
that
night
he
was
with
me
alone
for
about
ten
minutes
he
came
to
give
me
a
last
chance
he
said
if
i
liked
to
leave
my
husband
for
ever
and
go
to
america
with
him
i
might
do
so
but
before
he
let
me
out
of
that
place
he
must
have
my
solemn
oath
that
i
would
make
no
attempt
to
see
my
husband
that
i
would
never
again
communicate
with
any
one
i
had
known
up
to
that
time
that
i
would
begin
a
new
life
with
him
my
father
for
my
sole
protector
i
had
had
some
experience
of
the
result
of
opposing
him
he
said
and
he
now
expected
to
find
me
reasonable
you
can
imagine
my
answer
ellen
i
would
do
anything
sacrifice
anything
except
my
fidelity
to
my
husband
heaven
knows
i
would
have
given
twenty
years
of
my
life
to
escape
from
that
dismal
place
with
the
mere
chance
of
being
able
to
get
back
to
my
husband
but
i
would
not
take
a
false
oath
i
could
not
perjure
myself
as
that
man
would
have
made
me
perjure
myself
in
order
to
win
my
release
i
knelt
at
his
feet
and
clung
about
him
beseeching
him
with
all
the
power
i
had
to
set
me
free
but
he
was
harder
than
iron
just
at
the
end
when
he
had
the
door
open
and
was
leaving
me
telling
me
that
i
had
lost
my
last
chance
and
would
never
see
him
again
i
clung
about
him
with
one
wild
desperate
cry
he
flung
me
back
into
the
room
violently
and
shut
the
door
in
my
face
i
fancied
afterwards
that
that
cry
must
have
been
heard
and
that
if
there
had
been
any
creature
in
the
house
inclined
to
help
me
there
would
have
come
an
end
to
my
sufferings
but
the
time
passed
and
there
was
no
change
only
the
long
dreary
days
the
wretched
sleepless
nights
this
was
all
there
were
details
of
her
sufferings
which
marian
told
her
faithful
friend
when
her
mind
was
calmer
and
they
had
leisure
for
tranquil
talk
but
the
story
was
all
told
and
marian
lay
down
to
rest
in
the
familiar
room
unspeakably
grateful
to
god
for
her
rescue
and
only
eager
that
her
husband
should
be
informed
of
her
safety
she
had
not
yet
been
told
that
he
had
crossed
the
atlantic
in
search
of
her
deluded
by
a
false
scent
ellen
feared
to
tell
her
this
at
first
and
she
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
john
saltram
was
still
in
london
it
was
easy
to
defer
any
explanation
just
yet
on
account
of
marian
weakness
the
exertion
of
telling
the
brief
story
of
her
sufferings
had
left
her
prostrate
and
she
was
fain
to
obey
her
friendly
nurse
we
will
talk
about
everything
and
arrange
everything
dear
holbrook
ellen
said
resolutely
but
for
the
present
you
rest
and
you
must
take
everything
that
i
bring
you
and
be
very
good
and
with
that
she
kissed
and
left
her
to
perform
another
and
less
agreeable
duty
the
duty
of
attendance
by
her
husband
chapter
xlv
whitelaw
makes
his
will
they
had
carried
stephen
whitelaw
to
the
grange
and
he
lay
a
helpless
creature
beyond
hope
of
recovery
in
one
of
the
roomy
the
humble
crosber
surgeon
had
done
his
best
and
had
done
it
skilfully
being
a
man
of
large
experience
amongst
a
lowly
class
of
sufferers
and
to
the
aid
of
the
crosber
surgeon
had
come
a
more
prosperous
practitioner
from
malsham
who
had
driven
over
in
his
own
phaeton
but
between
them
both
they
could
make
nothing
of
stephen
whitelaw
his
race
was
run
he
had
been
severely
burnt
and
if
his
actual
injuries
were
not
enough
to
kill
him
there
was
little
chance
that
he
could
survive
the
shock
which
his
system
had
received
he
might
linger
a
little
might
hold
out
longer
than
they
expected
but
his
life
was
a
question
of
hours
the
doomed
man
had
seemed
from
the
first
to
have
a
conviction
of
the
truth
and
appeared
in
no
manner
surprised
when
in
answer
to
his
questions
the
malsham
doctor
admitted
that
his
case
was
fatal
and
suggested
that
if
he
had
anything
to
do
in
the
adjustment
of
his
affairs
he
could
scarcely
do
it
too
soon
at
this
whitelaw
groaned
aloud
if
he
could
in
any
manner
have
adjusted
his
affairs
so
as
to
take
his
money
with
him
the
suggestion
might
have
seemed
sensible
enough
but
that
being
impracticable
it
was
the
merest
futility
he
had
never
made
a
will
it
cost
him
too
much
anguish
to
give
away
his
money
even
on
paper
and
now
it
was
virtually
necessary
that
he
should
do
so
or
else
perhaps
his
wealth
would
by
some
occult
process
be
seized
upon
by
the
crown
a
power
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
regard
in
the
abstract
with
an
antagonistic
feeling
as
being
the
root
of
queen
taxes
to
leave
all
to
his
wife
with
some
slight
pension
to
tadman
seemed
the
most
obvious
course
he
had
married
for
love
and
the
wife
of
his
choice
had
been
very
dutiful
and
submissive
what
more
could
he
have
demanded
from
her
and
why
should
he
grudge
her
the
inheritance
of
his
wealth
well
he
would
not
have
grudged
it
to
her
perhaps
since
some
one
must
have
it
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
aggravating
conviction
that
she
would
marry
again
and
that
the
man
she
preferred
to
him
would
riot
in
the
possession
of
his
riches
she
would
marry
frank
randall
and
between
them
they
would
mismanage
and
ultimately
ruin
the
farm
he
remembered
the
cost
of
the
manure
he
had
put
upon
his
fields
that
year
and
regretted
that
useless
outlay
it
was
a
hard
thing
to
have
enriched
his
land
only
that
others
might
profit
by
the
produce
and
if
i
laid
down
a
yard
of
since
last
year
i
laid
down
a
dozen
mile
there
not
a
bit
of
swampy
ground
or
a
patch
of
sour
grass
on
the
farm
he
thought
bitterly
he
lay
for
some
hours
deliberating
as
to
what
he
should
do
death
was
near
but
not
so
very
close
to
him
just
yet
he
had
time
to
think
no
come
what
might
he
would
not
leave
the
bulk
of
his
property
to
fall
into
the
keeping
of
frank
randall
he
remembered
that
there
were
charitable
institutions
to
which
a
man
not
wishing
to
enrich
an
ungrateful
race
might
bequeath
his
money
and
obtain
some
credit
for
himself
thereby
which
no
man
could
expect
from
his
own
relations
there
was
an
infirmary
at
malsham
rather
a
juvenile
institution
as
yet
in
aid
whereof
whitelaw
had
often
been
plagued
for
subscriptions
reluctantly
doling
out
now
and
then
more
often
refusing
to
contribute
anything
he
had
never
thought
of
this
place
in
his
life
before
but
the
image
of
it
came
into
his
mind
now
as
he
had
seen
it
on
for
the
last
four
years
a
bran
new
building
in
malsham
he
thought
how
his
name
would
look
cut
in
large
letters
on
a
stone
tablet
on
the
face
of
that
edifice
it
would
be
something
to
get
for
his
money
a
very
poor
and
paltry
something
compared
with
the
delight
of
possession
but
just
a
little
better
than
nothing
he
lay
for
some
time
pondering
upon
this
with
that
image
of
the
stone
tablet
before
his
eyes
setting
forth
that
the
new
wing
of
this
institution
had
been
erected
at
the
desire
of
the
late
stephen
whitelaw
of
wyncomb
farm
who
had
bequeathed
a
sum
of
money
to
the
infirmary
for
that
purpose
whereby
two
new
wards
had
in
memory
of
that
respected
benefactor
been
entitled
the
whitelaw
wards
or
something
to
the
like
effect
he
composed
a
great
many
versions
of
the
inscription
as
he
lay
there
tolerably
easy
as
to
his
bodily
feelings
and
chiefly
anxious
concerning
the
disposal
of
the
money
but
being
unaccustomed
to
the
task
of
composition
he
found
it
more
difficult
than
he
could
have
supposed
to
set
forth
his
own
glory
in
a
concise
form
of
words
but
the
tablet
would
be
there
of
course
the
very
centre
and
keystone
of
the
building
as
it
were
indeed
whitelaw
resolved
to
make
his
bequest
contingent
upon
the
fulfilment
of
this
desire
later
in
the
evening
he
told
william
carley
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
about
his
will
and
would
be
glad
to
see
pivott
of
malsham
rival
solicitor
to
randall
of
the
same
town
as
soon
as
that
gentleman
could
be
summoned
to
his
bedside
the
bailiff
seemed
surprised
at
this
request
why
surely
steph
you
ca
want
a
lawyer
mixed
up
in
the
business
he
said
those
sort
of
chaps
only
live
by
making
work
for
one
another
you
know
how
to
make
your
will
well
enough
old
fellow
without
any
attorney
aforesaids
and
hereinafters
half
a
sheet
of
paper
and
a
couple
of
sentences
would
do
it
i
should
think
the
fewer
words
the
better
i
rather
have
pivott
and
do
it
in
a
regular
manner
whitelaw
answered
quietly
i
remember
in
a
forgery
case
that
was
in
the
papers
the
other
day
how
the
judge
said
of
the
deceased
testator
that
being
a
lawyer
he
was
too
wise
to
make
his
own
will
yes
i
rather
see
pivott
if
you
send
for
him
carley
it
always
best
to
be
on
the
safe
side
i
do
want
my
money
wasted
in
a
chancery
suit
when
i
lying
in
my
grave
william
carley
tried
to
argue
the
matter
with
his
but
the
attempt
was
quite
useless
whitelaw
had
always
been
the
most
obstinate
of
men
and
lying
on
his
bed
maimed
and
helpless
was
no
more
to
be
moved
from
his
resolve
than
if
he
had
been
a
roman
gladiator
who
had
just
trained
himself
for
an
encounter
with
lions
so
the
bailiff
was
compelled
to
obey
him
unwillingly
enough
and
dispatched
one
of
the
men
to
malsham
in
quest
of
pivott
the
attorney
the
practitioner
came
to
the
grange
as
fast
as
his
horse
could
carry
him
every
one
in
malsham
knew
by
this
time
that
stephen
whitelaw
was
a
doomed
man
and
pivott
felt
that
this
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
he
was
an
eminently
respectable
man
plump
and
dapper
with
a
rosy
face
and
an
air
of
honesty
that
made
the
law
seem
quite
a
pleasant
thing
he
was
speedily
seated
by
whitelaw
bed
with
a
pair
of
candles
and
writing
materials
upon
a
little
table
before
him
ready
to
obey
his
client
behests
and
with
the
aspect
of
a
man
to
whom
a
last
will
and
testament
involving
the
disposal
of
a
million
or
so
would
have
been
only
an
piece
of
practice
william
carley
had
shown
himself
very
civil
and
obliging
in
providing
for
the
lawyer
comfort
and
having
done
so
now
took
up
his
stand
by
the
evidently
intending
to
remain
as
a
spectator
of
the
business
but
an
uneasy
glance
which
the
patient
cast
from
time
to
time
in
the
direction
of
his
convinced
pivott
that
he
wanted
that
gentleman
to
be
got
rid
of
before
business
began
i
think
carley
it
would
be
as
well
for
our
poor
friend
and
i
to
be
alone
he
said
in
his
most
courteous
accents
fiddlesticks
exclaimed
the
bailiff
contemptuously
it
is
likely
that
stephen
can
have
any
secrets
from
his
wife
father
i
in
way
i
sure
and
i
not
going
to
put
my
spoke
in
the
wheel
let
him
leave
his
money
how
he
may
very
likely
not
my
dear
sir
indeed
i
am
sure
you
would
respect
our
poor
friend
wishes
even
if
they
were
to
take
a
form
unpleasing
to
yourself
which
is
far
from
likely
but
still
it
may
be
as
well
for
whitelaw
and
myself
to
be
alone
in
cases
of
this
kind
the
patient
is
apt
to
be
nervous
and
the
business
is
done
more
expeditiously
if
there
is
no
third
party
present
so
my
dear
carley
if
you
have
objection
steph
said
the
bailiff
abruptly
do
want
me
out
of
the
room
say
the
word
if
you
do
the
patient
writhed
hesitated
and
then
replied
with
some
confusion
if
it
all
the
same
to
you
william
carley
i
think
i
sooner
be
alone
with
mr
pivott
and
here
the
polite
attorney
having
opened
the
door
with
his
own
hands
bowed
the
bailiff
out
and
to
his
extreme
mortification
william
carley
found
himself
on
the
outside
of
his
room
before
he
had
time
to
make
any
farther
remonstrance
he
went
downstairs
and
paced
the
wainscoted
parlour
in
a
very
savage
frame
of
mind
there
some
kind
of
devil
work
hatching
up
there
he
muttered
to
himself
why
should
he
want
me
out
of
the
room
he
would
if
he
was
going
to
leave
all
his
money
to
ellen
as
he
ought
to
leave
it
who
else
is
there
to
get
it
not
that
old
mother
tadman
surely
she
an
artful
old
harridan
and
if
my
girl
had
not
been
a
fool
she
have
got
rid
of
her
out
of
hand
when
she
married
sure
to
goodness
can
never
stand
between
stephen
and
his
wife
and
who
else
is
there
no
one
that
i
know
of
no
one
stephen
would
have
kept
any
secret
all
these
years
from
the
folks
he
lived
amongst
it
is
likely
he
leave
it
all
to
his
wife
except
a
hundred
or
so
perhaps
to
mother
tadman
and
it
was
nothing
but
his
natural
closeness
that
made
him
want
me
out
of
the
way
and
at
this
stage
of
his
reflections
carley
opened
a
cupboard
near
the
and
brought
therefrom
a
from
the
contents
of
which
he
found
farther
solace
it
was
about
after
this
that
he
was
summoned
by
a
call
from
the
lawyer
who
was
standing
on
the
broad
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
when
the
bailiff
emerged
from
the
parlour
if
you
step
up
here
and
bring
one
of
your
men
with
you
i
shall
be
obliged
carley
the
attorney
said
looking
over
the
banisters
i
want
you
to
witness
your
will
carley
spirits
rose
a
little
at
this
he
was
not
much
versed
in
the
ways
of
lawyers
and
had
a
notion
that
pivott
would
read
the
will
to
him
perhaps
before
he
signed
it
it
flashed
upon
him
presently
that
a
legatee
could
not
benefit
by
a
will
which
he
had
witnessed
it
was
obvious
therefore
that
stephen
did
not
mean
him
to
have
anything
well
he
had
scarcely
expected
anything
if
his
daughter
inherited
all
it
would
be
pretty
much
the
same
thing
she
would
act
generously
of
course
he
went
into
the
kitchen
where
the
head
man
who
had
been
retained
on
the
premises
to
act
as
special
messenger
in
this
time
of
need
was
sitting
in
the
smoking
a
comfortable
pipe
after
his
walk
to
and
from
malsham
you
wanted
upstairs
a
minute
joe
he
said
and
the
two
went
clumping
up
the
wide
old
oaken
staircase
the
witnessing
of
the
will
was
a
very
brief
business
pivott
did
not
offer
to
throw
any
light
upon
its
contents
nor
was
the
bailiff
sharpsighted
as
he
might
be
able
to
seize
upon
so
much
as
one
paragraph
or
line
of
the
document
during
the
process
of
attaching
his
signature
thereto
when
the
ceremony
was
concluded
stephen
whitelaw
sank
back
upon
his
pillow
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
i
do
think
i
could
have
done
any
better
he
murmured
it
a
hard
thing
for
a
man
of
my
age
to
leave
everything
behind
him
but
i
do
see
that
i
could
have
done
better
you
have
done
that
my
dear
sir
which
might
afford
comfort
to
any
said
the
lawyer
solemnly
he
folded
the
will
and
put
it
into
his
pocket
our
friend
desires
me
to
take
charge
of
this
document
he
said
to
william
carley
you
will
have
no
reason
to
complain
on
your
account
when
you
become
familiar
with
its
contents
she
has
been
fairly
treated
i
may
say
very
fairly
treated
the
bailiff
did
not
much
relish
the
tone
of
this
assurance
fair
treatment
might
mean
very
little
i
hope
she
has
been
well
treated
he
answered
in
a
surly
manner
been
a
good
wife
to
stephen
whitelaw
and
would
continue
so
to
be
if
he
was
to
live
twenty
years
longer
when
a
pretty
young
woman
marries
a
man
twice
her
age
she
a
right
to
expect
handsome
treatment
pivott
it
ca
be
too
handsome
for
justice
in
my
opinion
the
solicitor
gave
a
little
gentle
sigh
as
an
interested
party
carley
he
said
your
opinion
is
not
as
valuable
as
it
might
be
under
other
circumstances
however
i
do
think
your
daughter
will
complain
and
i
am
sure
the
world
will
applaud
what
our
poor
friend
has
done
of
his
own
accord
mind
carley
wholly
and
solely
of
his
own
spontaneous
desire
it
is
a
thing
that
i
should
only
have
been
too
proud
to
suggest
but
the
responsibility
of
such
a
suggestion
is
one
which
i
could
never
have
taken
upon
myself
it
would
have
been
out
of
my
province
indeed
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
remember
this
my
dear
sir
the
bailiff
was
puzzled
and
showed
pivott
to
the
door
with
a
moody
countenance
i
thought
there
was
some
devil
work
he
muttered
to
himself
as
he
watched
the
lawyer
mount
his
stiff
brown
cob
and
ride
away
into
the
night
but
what
does
it
all
mean
and
what
has
stephen
whitelaw
done
with
his
money
we
shall
know
that
pretty
soon
anyhow
he
ca
last
long
chapter
xlvi
ellen
regains
her
liberty
stephen
whitelaw
lingered
for
two
days
and
two
nights
and
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
departed
this
life
making
a
very
decent
end
of
it
and
troubled
by
no
thought
that
his
existence
had
been
an
unworthy
one
before
he
died
he
told
his
wife
something
of
how
he
had
been
tempted
into
the
doing
of
that
foul
deed
whereof
marian
saltram
had
been
the
victim
those
two
were
alone
together
the
day
before
he
died
when
stephen
of
his
own
free
will
made
the
following
statement
it
was
holbrook
father
you
see
he
said
in
a
plausible
tone
that
put
it
to
me
how
he
might
want
his
daughter
taken
care
of
for
a
time
it
might
be
a
short
time
or
it
might
be
rather
a
longish
time
according
to
how
circumstances
should
work
out
we
met
once
before
at
the
king
arms
at
malsham
where
nowell
was
staying
and
where
i
went
in
of
an
evening
once
in
a
way
after
market
and
he
made
pretty
free
with
me
and
asked
me
a
good
many
questions
about
myself
and
told
me
a
good
bit
about
himself
in
a
friendly
way
he
told
me
how
his
daughter
had
gone
against
him
and
was
likely
to
go
against
him
and
how
some
property
that
ought
in
common
justice
to
have
been
left
to
him
had
been
left
to
her
he
was
going
to
give
her
a
fair
chance
he
said
if
she
liked
to
leave
her
husband
who
was
a
scheming
scoundrel
and
obey
him
she
might
have
a
happy
home
with
him
if
she
was
reasonable
if
not
he
should
use
his
authority
as
a
father
he
came
to
see
me
at
wyncomb
next
day
dropped
in
unawares
like
when
mother
tadman
was
out
of
the
way
not
that
i
had
asked
him
you
see
he
seemed
to
be
quite
taken
with
the
place
and
made
me
show
him
all
over
the
house
and
then
he
took
a
glass
of
something
and
sat
and
talked
a
bit
and
went
away
without
having
said
a
word
about
his
daughter
but
before
he
went
he
made
me
promise
that
i
go
and
see
him
at
the
arms
that
night
well
you
see
nell
as
he
seemed
to
have
taken
a
fancy
to
me
as
you
may
say
and
had
told
me
he
could
put
me
up
to
making
more
of
my
money
and
had
altogether
been
uncommonly
pleasant
i
did
care
to
say
no
and
i
went
i
was
rather
taken
aback
at
the
king
arms
when
they
showed
me
to
a
private
room
because
i
met
nowell
before
in
the
commercial
however
there
he
was
sitting
in
front
of
a
blazing
fire
and
with
a
couple
of
decanters
of
wine
upon
the
table
he
was
very
civil
could
have
been
more
friendly
and
we
talked
and
talked
he
was
always
harping
on
his
daughter
till
at
last
he
came
out
with
what
he
wanted
would
i
give
her
for
a
bit
just
to
keep
her
out
of
the
way
of
her
husband
and
designing
people
supposing
she
should
turn
obstinate
and
refuse
to
go
abroad
with
him
a
rare
old
roomy
place
he
said
saw
some
rooms
upstairs
at
the
end
of
a
long
passage
which
do
seem
to
have
been
used
for
years
you
might
keep
my
lady
in
one
of
those
and
that
fine
husband
of
hers
would
be
as
puzzled
where
to
find
her
as
if
she
was
in
the
centre
of
africa
it
would
be
a
very
easy
thing
to
do
he
said
it
would
be
only
friendly
in
you
to
do
it
o
stephen
cried
his
wife
reproachfully
how
could
you
ever
consent
to
such
a
wicked
thing
i
do
know
about
the
wickedness
of
it
whitelaw
responded
with
rather
a
sullen
air
a
daughter
is
bound
to
obey
her
father
is
she
and
if
she
do
i
should
think
he
had
the
power
to
do
what
he
liked
with
her
that
how
i
should
look
at
it
if
i
was
a
father
it
all
very
well
to
talk
you
see
nell
but
you
do
know
the
arguments
such
a
man
as
that
can
bring
to
bear
i
did
want
to
do
it
i
was
against
it
from
the
first
it
was
a
dangerous
business
and
might
bring
me
into
trouble
but
that
man
bore
down
upon
me
to
that
extent
that
he
made
me
promise
anything
and
when
i
went
home
that
night
it
was
with
the
understanding
that
i
was
to
fit
up
a
room
there
was
a
double
door
to
be
put
up
to
shut
out
sound
and
a
deal
more
ready
for
holbrook
in
case
her
father
wanted
to
get
her
out
of
the
way
for
a
bit
he
promised
to
pay
you
of
course
ellen
said
not
quite
able
to
conceal
the
contempt
and
aversion
which
this
confession
of
her
inspired
well
yes
a
man
does
put
himself
in
jeopardy
like
that
for
nothing
he
was
to
give
me
a
certain
sum
of
money
down
the
first
night
that
holbrook
slept
in
my
house
and
another
sum
of
money
before
he
went
to
america
and
an
annual
sum
for
continuing
to
take
care
of
her
if
he
wanted
to
keep
her
quiet
permanently
as
he
might
altogether
it
would
be
a
very
profitable
business
he
told
me
and
i
ought
to
consider
myself
uncommonly
lucky
to
get
such
a
chance
as
to
the
kindness
or
unkindness
of
the
matter
it
was
better
than
shutting
her
up
in
a
lunatic
asylum
he
said
and
he
might
have
to
do
that
if
i
refused
to
take
her
she
was
very
weak
in
her
head
he
said
and
the
doctors
would
throw
no
difficulty
in
his
way
if
he
wanted
to
put
her
into
a
madhouse
but
you
must
have
known
that
was
a
lie
exclaimed
ellen
indignantly
you
had
seen
and
talked
to
her
you
must
have
known
that
holbrook
was
as
sane
as
you
or
i
i
could
be
supposed
to
know
better
than
her
own
father
answered
whitelaw
in
an
injured
tone
he
had
a
right
to
know
best
however
no
use
arguing
about
it
now
he
had
such
a
power
over
me
that
i
go
against
him
so
i
gave
in
and
holbrook
came
to
wyncomb
she
was
to
be
treated
kindly
and
made
comfortable
her
father
said
that
was
agreed
between
us
and
she
has
been
treated
kindly
and
made
comfortable
i
had
to
trust
some
one
to
wait
upon
her
and
when
nowell
saw
the
two
girls
he
chose
sarah
batts
girl
will
do
anything
for
money
he
said
stupid
but
she
wise
enough
to
know
her
own
interest
and
she
hold
her
tongue
so
i
trusted
sarah
batts
and
i
had
to
pay
her
pretty
stiffly
to
keep
the
secret
but
she
was
a
rare
one
to
do
the
work
and
she
went
about
it
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
not
even
mother
tadman
ever
suspected
her
it
was
a
wicked
piece
of
business
wicked
from
first
to
last
said
ellen
i
ca
bear
to
hear
about
it
and
then
remembering
that
the
sinner
was
so
near
his
end
and
that
this
voluntary
confession
of
his
was
in
some
manner
a
sign
of
repentance
she
felt
some
compunction
and
spoke
to
him
in
a
softer
tone
still
i
grateful
to
you
for
telling
me
the
truth
at
last
stephen
she
said
and
thank
god
there
no
harm
done
that
need
last
for
ever
thank
god
that
dear
young
lady
did
not
lose
her
life
shut
up
a
prisoner
in
that
miserable
room
as
she
might
have
done
she
had
her
victuals
regular
observed
whitelaw
and
the
best
eating
and
drinking
wo
keep
any
one
alive
if
their
breaking
said
ellen
but
thank
heaven
her
sufferings
have
come
to
an
end
now
and
i
trust
god
will
forgive
your
share
in
them
stephen
and
then
sitting
by
his
bedside
through
the
long
hours
of
that
night
she
tried
in
very
simple
words
to
awaken
him
to
a
sense
of
his
condition
it
was
not
an
easy
business
to
let
any
glimmer
of
spiritual
light
in
upon
the
darkness
of
that
sordid
mind
there
did
arise
perhaps
in
this
last
extremity
some
dim
sense
of
remorse
in
the
breast
of
whitelaw
some
vague
consciousness
that
in
that
one
act
of
his
life
and
in
the
whole
tenor
of
his
life
he
had
not
exactly
shaped
his
conduct
according
to
that
model
which
the
parson
had
held
up
for
his
imitation
in
certain
rather
prosy
sermons
indifferently
heard
on
the
rare
occasions
of
his
attendance
at
the
parish
church
but
whatever
terrors
the
world
to
come
might
hold
for
him
seemed
very
faint
and
shapeless
compared
with
the
things
from
which
he
was
to
be
taken
he
thought
of
his
untimely
death
as
a
hardship
an
injustice
almost
when
his
wife
entreated
him
to
see
the
vicar
of
crosber
before
he
died
he
refused
at
first
asking
what
good
the
vicar
talk
could
do
him
if
he
could
keep
me
alive
as
long
as
till
next
july
to
see
how
those
turnips
answer
with
the
new
dressing
i
see
him
fast
enough
he
said
peevishly
but
he
ca
and
i
do
want
to
hear
his
preaching
but
it
would
be
a
comfort
to
you
surely
stephen
to
have
him
talk
to
you
a
little
about
the
goodness
and
mercy
of
god
he
wo
tell
you
hard
things
i
sure
of
that
no
i
suppose
he
try
and
make
believe
that
death
uncommon
pleasant
answered
whitelaw
with
a
bitter
laugh
as
if
it
could
be
pleasant
to
any
man
to
leave
such
a
place
as
wyncomb
after
doing
as
much
for
the
land
and
spending
as
much
labour
and
money
upon
it
as
i
have
done
it
like
nurses
telling
children
that
a
dose
of
physic
pleasant
they
would
like
to
have
to
take
it
themselves
and
then
when
his
last
day
had
dawned
and
he
felt
himself
growing
weaker
whitelaw
expressed
himself
willing
to
comply
with
his
wife
request
if
it
any
satisfaction
to
you
nell
i
see
the
parson
he
said
his
talk
ca
do
me
much
harm
anyhow
whereupon
the
rector
of
crosber
and
hallibury
was
sent
for
and
came
swiftly
to
perform
his
duty
to
the
dying
man
he
was
closeted
with
whitelaw
for
some
time
and
did
his
best
to
awaken
christian
feelings
in
the
farmer
breast
but
it
was
doubtful
if
his
pious
efforts
resulted
in
much
the
soul
of
stephen
whitelaw
was
in
his
barns
and
granaries
with
his
pigs
and
cattle
he
could
not
so
much
as
conceive
the
idea
of
a
world
in
which
there
should
be
no
such
thing
as
sale
and
profit
his
end
came
quietly
enough
at
last
and
ellen
was
free
her
time
of
bondage
had
been
very
brief
yet
she
felt
herself
twenty
years
older
than
she
had
seemed
before
that
interval
of
misery
began
when
the
will
was
read
by
pivott
on
the
day
of
stephen
funeral
it
was
found
that
the
farmer
had
left
his
wife
two
hundred
a
year
derivable
from
real
estate
to
rebecca
tadman
his
cousin
he
bequeathed
an
annuity
of
forty
pounds
the
said
annuity
to
revert
to
ellen
upon
tadman
death
should
ellen
survive
the
remaining
portion
of
his
real
estate
he
bequeathed
to
one
john
james
harris
a
distant
cousin
who
owned
a
farm
in
wiltshire
with
whom
stephen
whitelaw
had
spent
some
years
of
his
boyhood
and
from
whom
he
had
learned
the
science
of
agriculture
it
was
less
from
any
love
the
testator
bore
john
james
harris
than
from
a
morbid
jealousy
of
his
probable
successor
frank
randall
that
the
wiltshire
farmer
had
been
named
as
residuary
legatee
if
stephen
whitelaw
could
have
left
his
real
estate
to
the
infirmary
he
would
have
so
left
it
his
personal
estate
consisting
of
divers
investments
in
railway
shares
and
other
kinds
of
stock
all
of
a
very
safe
kind
was
to
be
realized
and
the
entire
proceeds
devoted
to
the
erection
of
an
additional
wing
for
the
extension
of
malsham
infirmary
and
his
gift
was
to
be
recorded
on
a
stone
tablet
in
a
conspicuous
position
on
the
front
of
that
building
this
which
was
an
absolute
condition
attached
to
the
bequest
had
been
set
forth
with
great
minuteness
by
the
lawyer
at
the
special
desire
of
his
client
carley
expression
of
opinion
after
hearing
this
will
read
need
not
be
recorded
here
it
was
forcible
to
say
the
least
of
it
and
pivott
the
malsham
solicitor
protested
against
such
language
as
an
outrage
upon
the
finer
feelings
of
our
nature
some
degree
of
disappointment
is
perhaps
excusable
upon
your
part
my
dear
sir
said
the
lawyer
who
wished
to
keep
the
widow
for
his
client
and
had
therefore
no
desire
to
offend
her
father
but
i
am
sure
that
in
your
calmer
moments
you
will
admit
that
the
work
to
which
your
has
devoted
the
bulk
of
his
accumulations
is
a
noble
one
for
ages
to
come
the
sick
and
the
suffering
among
our
townsfolk
will
bless
the
name
of
whitelaw
there
is
a
touching
reflection
for
you
carley
and
really
now
your
amiable
daughter
with
an
income
of
two
hundred
per
annum
to
say
nothing
of
that
reversion
which
must
fall
in
to
her
on
tadman
decease
is
left
in
a
very
fair
position
i
should
not
have
consented
to
draw
up
that
will
sir
if
i
had
considered
it
an
unjust
one
then
there
a
wide
difference
between
your
notion
of
justice
and
mine
growled
the
bailiff
who
thereupon
relapsed
into
grim
silence
feeling
that
complaint
was
useless
he
could
no
more
alter
the
conditions
of
whitelaw
will
than
he
could
bring
whitelaw
back
to
life
and
that
last
operation
was
one
which
he
was
by
no
means
eager
to
perform
ellen
herself
felt
no
disappointment
she
fancied
indeed
that
her
husband
whom
she
had
never
deceived
by
any
pretence
of
affection
had
behaved
with
sufficient
generosity
towards
her
two
hundred
a
year
seemed
a
large
income
to
her
it
would
give
her
perfect
independence
and
the
power
to
help
others
if
need
were
chapter
xlvii
closing
scenes
it
was
not
until
the
day
of
her
husband
funeral
that
ellen
whitelaw
wrote
to
fenton
to
tell
him
what
had
happened
she
knew
that
her
letter
was
likely
to
bring
him
to
the
grange
and
she
wished
his
coming
to
be
deferred
until
that
last
dismal
day
was
over
nor
was
she
sorry
that
there
should
be
some
little
pause
a
brief
interval
of
ignorance
and
tranquillity
in
marian
life
before
she
heard
of
her
husband
useless
voyage
across
the
atlantic
she
was
in
sad
need
of
rest
of
mind
and
body
and
even
in
those
few
days
gained
considerable
strength
by
the
aid
of
whitelaw
tender
nursing
she
had
not
left
her
room
during
the
time
that
death
was
in
the
darkened
house
and
it
was
only
on
the
morning
after
the
funeral
that
she
came
downstairs
for
the
first
time
her
appearance
had
improved
wonderfully
in
that
interval
of
little
more
than
a
week
her
eyes
had
lost
their
dim
weary
look
the
deathly
pallor
of
her
complexion
had
given
place
to
a
faint
bloom
but
grateful
as
she
was
for
her
own
deliverance
she
was
full
of
anxiety
about
her
husband
ellen
whitelaw
vague
assurances
that
all
would
be
well
that
he
would
soon
be
restored
to
her
were
not
enough
to
set
her
mind
at
ease
ellen
had
not
the
courage
to
tell
her
the
truth
it
was
better
that
gilbert
fenton
should
do
that
she
thought
he
who
knew
all
the
circumstances
of
holbrook
journey
and
the
probabilities
as
to
his
return
would
be
so
much
better
able
to
comfort
and
reassure
his
wife
he
will
come
i
have
no
doubt
ellen
said
to
herself
on
the
morning
after
her
husband
funeral
she
told
marian
how
she
had
written
to
fenton
on
the
day
before
in
order
to
avoid
the
agitation
of
a
surprise
should
he
appear
at
the
grange
without
waiting
to
announce
his
coming
nor
was
she
mistaken
as
to
the
probability
of
his
speedy
arrival
it
was
not
long
after
noon
when
there
came
a
loud
peal
of
the
bell
that
rang
so
rarely
ellen
ran
herself
to
the
gate
to
admit
the
visitor
she
had
told
him
of
her
husband
death
in
her
last
letter
and
her
widow
weeds
were
no
surprise
to
him
he
was
pale
but
very
calm
she
is
well
he
asked
eagerly
yes
sir
she
is
as
well
as
one
could
look
for
her
to
be
poor
dear
after
what
she
has
gone
through
but
she
is
much
changed
since
last
you
saw
her
you
must
prepare
yourself
for
that
sir
and
she
is
very
anxious
about
her
husband
i
do
know
how
she
take
it
when
she
hears
that
he
has
gone
to
america
yes
that
is
a
bad
business
whitelaw
gilbert
answered
gravely
he
was
not
in
a
fit
state
to
travel
unfortunately
he
was
only
just
recovering
from
a
severe
illness
and
was
as
weak
as
a
child
o
dear
o
dear
but
you
wo
tell
holbrook
that
sir
i
wo
tell
her
more
than
i
can
help
of
course
i
do
want
to
alarm
her
but
i
am
bound
to
tell
her
some
portion
of
the
truth
you
did
her
husband
a
great
wrong
you
see
whitelaw
when
you
suspected
him
of
some
share
in
this
vile
business
he
has
shown
himself
really
devoted
to
her
i
thank
god
that
it
has
proved
so
and
now
tell
me
more
about
this
affair
your
letter
explains
so
little
i
will
tell
you
all
sir
they
walked
in
the
garden
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
gilbert
went
into
the
house
eager
as
he
was
to
see
marian
he
was
still
more
anxious
to
hear
full
particulars
of
that
foul
plot
of
which
she
had
been
made
the
victim
ellen
whitelaw
told
him
the
story
very
plainly
making
no
attempt
to
conceal
her
husband
guilty
part
in
the
business
and
the
story
being
finished
she
took
him
straight
to
the
parlour
where
he
had
seen
marian
for
the
first
time
after
her
marriage
it
was
a
warm
bright
day
and
all
three
windows
were
open
marian
was
sitting
by
one
of
them
with
some
scrap
of
work
lying
forgotten
in
her
lap
she
started
up
from
her
seat
as
gilbert
went
into
the
room
and
hastened
forward
to
meet
him
how
good
of
you
to
come
she
cried
and
you
have
brought
me
news
of
my
husband
i
am
sure
of
that
yes
dear
holbrook
saltram
may
i
not
call
you
by
that
name
now
i
know
all
and
have
forgiven
all
then
you
know
how
deeply
he
sinned
against
you
and
how
much
he
valued
your
friendship
he
would
never
have
played
so
false
a
part
but
for
that
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
being
estranged
from
you
we
are
not
estranged
i
have
tried
to
be
angry
with
him
but
there
are
some
old
ties
that
a
man
can
not
break
he
has
used
me
very
ill
marian
but
he
is
still
my
friend
his
voice
broke
a
little
as
he
uttered
the
old
familiar
name
yes
she
was
changed
cruelly
changed
by
that
ordeal
of
six
months
suffering
the
brightness
of
her
beauty
had
quite
faded
but
there
was
something
in
the
altered
face
that
touched
him
more
deeply
than
the
old
magic
she
was
dearer
to
him
perhaps
in
this
hour
than
she
had
ever
been
yet
dearer
to
him
and
yet
divided
from
him
utterly
now
that
he
professed
himself
her
husband
friend
as
well
as
her
own
friendship
brotherly
affection
those
chastened
sentiments
which
he
had
fancied
had
superseded
all
warmer
feelings
where
were
they
now
by
the
passionate
beating
of
his
heart
by
his
eager
longing
to
clasp
that
faded
form
to
his
breast
he
knew
that
he
loved
her
as
dearly
as
on
the
day
when
she
promised
to
be
his
wife
that
he
must
love
her
with
the
same
measure
till
the
end
of
his
existence
thank
god
for
that
marian
said
gently
thank
god
that
you
are
still
friends
but
why
did
he
not
come
with
you
you
have
told
him
about
me
i
suppose
not
yet
marian
i
have
not
been
able
to
do
that
nor
could
he
come
with
me
he
has
left
england
on
a
false
scent
and
then
he
told
her
in
a
few
words
the
story
of
john
saltram
voyage
to
new
york
making
very
light
of
the
matter
and
speaking
cheerily
of
his
early
return
he
will
come
back
at
once
of
course
when
he
finds
how
he
has
been
deceived
gilbert
said
marian
was
cruelly
distressed
by
this
disappointment
she
tried
to
bear
the
blow
bravely
and
listened
with
a
gentle
patience
to
reassuring
arguments
but
it
was
a
hard
thing
to
bear
he
will
be
back
soon
you
say
she
said
but
soon
is
such
a
vague
word
and
you
have
not
told
me
when
he
went
gilbert
told
her
the
date
of
john
saltram
departure
she
began
immediately
to
question
him
as
to
the
usual
length
of
the
voyage
and
to
calculate
the
time
he
had
had
for
his
going
and
return
taking
the
average
length
of
the
voyage
as
ten
days
and
allowing
ten
days
for
delay
in
new
york
a
month
would
give
ample
time
for
the
two
journeys
and
john
saltram
had
been
away
more
than
a
month
gilbert
could
see
that
marian
was
quick
to
take
alarm
on
discovering
this
my
dear
saltram
be
reasonable
he
said
gently
finding
such
a
cheat
put
upon
him
your
husband
would
naturally
be
anxious
to
bring
your
father
to
some
kind
of
reckoning
to
extort
from
him
the
real
secret
of
your
fate
he
would
no
doubt
stay
in
new
york
to
do
this
and
we
can
not
tell
how
difficult
the
business
might
prove
or
how
long
it
would
occupy
him
but
if
he
had
been
detained
like
that
he
would
surely
have
written
to
you
said
marian
and
you
have
heard
nothing
from
him
since
he
left
england
unhappily
nothing
but
he
is
not
the
best
correspondent
in
the
world
you
know
yes
yes
i
know
that
yet
in
such
a
case
as
this
he
would
surely
have
written
if
he
were
well
her
eyes
met
gilbert
as
she
said
this
she
stopped
abruptly
dismayed
by
something
in
his
face
you
are
hiding
some
misfortune
from
me
she
cried
i
can
see
it
in
your
face
you
have
had
bad
news
of
him
upon
my
honour
no
he
was
not
in
very
strong
health
when
he
left
england
that
is
all
and
like
yourself
i
am
naturally
anxious
he
had
not
meant
to
admit
even
as
much
as
this
just
yet
but
having
said
this
he
found
himself
compelled
to
say
more
marian
questioned
him
so
closely
that
she
finally
extorted
from
him
the
whole
history
of
john
saltram
illness
after
that
it
was
quite
in
vain
to
attempt
consolation
she
was
very
gentle
very
patient
troubling
him
with
no
vain
wailings
and
lamentations
but
he
could
see
that
her
heart
was
almost
broken
he
left
her
at
the
end
of
a
few
hours
to
return
to
london
promising
to
go
on
to
liverpool
next
day
in
order
to
be
on
the
spot
to
await
her
husband
return
and
to
send
her
the
earliest
possible
tidings
of
it
your
friendship
for
us
has
given
you
nothing
but
trouble
and
pain
she
said
but
if
you
will
do
this
for
me
i
shall
be
grateful
to
you
for
the
rest
of
my
life
there
was
no
occasion
for
that
journey
to
liverpool
when
he
arrived
in
london
that
night
gilbert
fenton
found
a
letter
waiting
for
him
at
his
lodgings
a
letter
with
the
new
york
but
addressed
in
his
friend
hand
he
tore
it
open
hurriedly
just
a
little
alarmed
by
this
fact
his
first
feeling
was
one
of
relief
there
were
three
separate
sheets
of
paper
in
the
envelope
and
the
first
which
he
took
up
was
in
john
saltram
hand
a
hurried
eager
letter
dated
some
weeks
before
my
dear
gilbert
he
wrote
i
have
been
duped
this
man
nowell
is
a
most
consummate
scoundrel
the
woman
with
him
is
not
marian
but
some
girl
whom
he
has
picked
up
to
represent
her
his
wife
perhaps
or
something
worse
i
was
very
ill
on
the
passage
out
and
only
discovered
the
trick
at
the
last
since
then
i
have
traced
the
scoundrel
to
his
quarters
and
have
had
an
interview
with
him
rather
a
stormy
one
as
you
may
suppose
but
the
long
and
short
of
it
is
that
he
defies
me
he
tells
me
that
my
wife
is
in
england
and
safe
but
will
admit
no
more
i
have
consulted
a
lawyer
here
but
it
seems
i
can
do
nothing
against
him
or
nothing
that
will
not
involve
a
more
complicated
and
protracted
business
than
i
have
time
or
patience
for
i
do
want
this
wretch
to
go
it
is
evident
that
he
has
hatched
this
plot
in
order
to
get
possession
of
his
daughter
money
and
i
have
little
doubt
the
lawyer
medler
is
in
it
but
of
course
my
first
duty
as
well
as
my
most
ardent
desire
is
to
find
marian
and
for
this
purpose
i
shall
come
back
to
england
by
the
first
steamer
that
will
convey
me
leaving
punishment
to
the
chances
of
the
future
my
dear
girl
property
as
well
as
herself
will
be
best
protected
by
my
presence
in
england
there
was
a
pause
here
and
the
next
paragraph
was
dated
two
days
after
if
i
have
strength
to
come
i
shall
return
by
the
next
steamer
but
the
fact
is
my
dear
gilbert
i
am
very
ill
have
been
completely
prostrate
since
writing
the
above
and
a
doctor
here
tells
me
i
must
not
think
of
the
voyage
yet
awhile
but
i
sha
allow
his
opinion
to
govern
me
if
i
can
crawl
to
the
steamer
which
starts
three
days
hence
i
shall
come
then
there
was
another
break
and
again
the
writer
went
on
in
a
weak
and
more
straggling
hand
without
any
date
this
time
my
dear
gil
it
nearly
a
week
since
i
wrote
the
last
lines
and
been
in
bed
ever
since
i
afraid
there
no
hope
for
me
in
plain
words
i
believe
i
dying
to
you
i
leave
the
duty
i
am
not
allowed
to
perform
marian
is
living
and
in
england
i
believe
that
scoundrelly
father
of
hers
told
me
the
truth
when
he
declared
that
you
will
not
rest
till
you
find
her
i
know
and
you
will
protect
her
fortune
from
that
wretch
god
bless
you
faithful
old
friend
heaven
knows
how
i
yearn
for
the
sight
of
your
honest
face
lying
here
among
strangers
to
be
buried
in
a
foreign
land
see
that
my
wife
pays
branston
the
money
i
borrowed
to
come
here
and
tell
her
that
i
was
grateful
to
her
and
thought
of
her
on
my
dying
bed
to
my
wife
i
send
no
message
she
knows
that
i
loved
her
but
how
dear
she
has
been
to
me
in
this
bitter
time
of
separation
she
can
never
know
you
will
find
a
bulky
at
my
chambers
in
the
bottom
drawer
on
the
right
side
of
my
desk
it
is
my
life
of
swift
unfinished
as
my
own
life
if
after
reading
it
you
should
think
it
worth
publishing
as
a
fragment
with
my
name
to
it
i
should
wish
you
to
arrange
its
publication
i
should
be
glad
to
leave
my
name
upon
something
in
a
stranger
hand
and
upon
another
sheet
of
paper
gilbert
read
the
end
of
his
friend
history
sir
i
regret
to
inform
you
that
your
friend
saltram
expired
at
eleven
last
night
wednesday
may
after
an
illness
of
a
fortnight
duration
throughout
which
i
gave
him
my
best
attention
as
his
medical
adviser
he
will
be
buried
in
the
cemetery
on
long
island
at
his
own
request
and
he
has
left
sufficient
funds
for
the
necessary
expenses
and
the
payment
of
his
hotel
bill
as
well
as
my
own
small
claim
against
him
any
surplus
which
may
be
left
i
shall
forward
to
you
when
these
payments
have
been
made
i
enclose
a
detailed
account
of
the
case
for
your
satisfaction
and
have
the
honour
to
be
sir
yours
very
obediently
silas
warren
new
york
may
this
was
all
and
gilbert
had
to
carry
these
tidings
to
marian
for
a
time
he
was
almost
paralyzed
by
the
blow
he
had
loved
this
man
as
a
brother
if
he
had
ever
doubted
the
strength
of
his
attachment
to
john
saltram
he
knew
it
now
but
the
worst
of
all
was
that
one
bitter
fact
marian
must
be
told
and
by
him
he
went
back
to
the
grange
next
day
again
and
again
upon
that
miserable
journey
he
acted
over
the
scene
which
was
to
take
place
when
he
came
to
the
end
of
it
in
spite
of
himself
as
it
were
going
over
the
words
he
was
to
say
while
marian
face
rose
before
him
like
a
picture
how
was
he
to
tell
her
would
not
the
very
fact
of
this
desolation
coming
to
her
from
his
lips
be
sufficient
to
make
him
hateful
to
her
in
all
the
days
to
come
more
than
once
upon
that
journey
he
was
tempted
to
turn
back
and
to
leave
his
dismal
news
to
be
told
in
a
letter
but
when
the
fatal
moment
did
at
last
arrive
the
event
in
no
manner
realized
the
picture
of
his
imagination
time
was
not
given
to
him
to
speak
those
solemn
preliminary
words
by
which
he
had
intended
to
prepare
the
victim
for
her
deathblow
his
presence
there
and
his
presence
alone
were
all
sufficient
to
prepare
her
for
some
calamity
you
have
come
back
to
me
and
without
him
she
exclaimed
tell
me
what
has
happened
tell
me
at
once
he
had
no
time
to
defer
the
stroke
his
face
told
her
so
much
in
a
few
moments
before
his
broken
words
could
shape
themselves
into
coherence
she
knew
all
there
are
some
things
that
can
never
be
forgotten
never
to
his
dying
day
can
gilbert
fenton
forget
the
quiet
agony
he
had
to
witness
then
she
was
very
ill
for
a
long
time
after
that
day
in
danger
of
death
all
that
she
had
suffered
during
her
confinement
at
wyncomb
seemed
to
fall
upon
her
now
with
a
double
weight
only
the
supreme
devotion
of
those
who
cared
for
her
could
have
carried
her
through
that
weary
time
but
the
day
did
at
last
come
when
the
peril
was
pronounced
a
thing
of
the
past
and
the
feeble
submissive
patient
might
be
carried
away
from
the
grange
from
the
scene
of
her
brief
married
life
and
of
her
bitter
widowhood
she
went
with
ellen
whitelaw
to
ventnor
it
was
late
in
august
before
she
was
able
to
bear
this
journey
and
in
this
mild
refuge
for
invalids
she
remained
throughout
the
winter
even
during
that
trying
time
when
it
seemed
more
than
doubtful
whether
she
could
live
to
profit
by
her
grandfather
bequest
her
interests
had
been
carefully
watched
by
gilbert
fenton
it
was
tolerably
evident
to
his
mind
that
medler
had
been
a
tacit
accomplice
in
percival
fraud
or
at
any
rate
that
he
had
enabled
the
pretended
holbrook
to
obtain
a
large
sum
of
ready
money
with
greater
ease
than
she
could
have
done
had
he
as
executor
been
scrupulously
careful
to
obtain
her
identification
from
some
more
trustworthy
person
than
he
knew
percival
nowell
to
be
whether
these
suspicions
of
gilbert
were
correct
whether
the
lawyer
had
been
actually
deceived
or
had
willingly
lent
himself
to
the
furtherance
of
nowell
design
must
remain
unascertained
as
well
as
the
amount
of
profit
which
medler
may
have
secured
to
himself
by
the
transaction
the
law
held
him
liable
for
the
whole
of
the
moneys
thus
paid
over
in
fraud
or
error
but
the
law
could
do
very
little
against
a
man
whose
sole
earthly
possessions
appeared
to
be
comprised
by
the
desks
and
shabby
chairs
and
tables
in
his
dingy
offices
the
poor
consolation
remained
of
making
an
attempt
to
get
him
struck
off
the
rolls
but
when
the
city
firm
of
solicitors
in
whose
hands
gilbert
had
placed
saltram
affairs
suggested
this
marian
herself
entreated
that
the
man
might
have
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
as
to
his
complicity
with
her
father
and
that
no
effort
should
be
made
to
bring
legal
ruin
upon
him
there
has
been
enough
misery
caused
by
this
money
already
she
said
let
the
matter
rest
i
am
richer
than
i
care
to
be
as
it
is
of
course
medler
was
not
allowed
to
retain
his
position
as
executor
the
court
of
chancery
was
appealed
to
in
the
usual
manner
and
intervened
for
the
future
protection
of
saltram
interests
about
nowell
conduct
there
was
of
course
no
doubt
but
after
wasting
a
good
deal
of
money
and
trouble
in
his
pursuit
gilbert
was
fain
to
abandon
all
hope
of
catching
him
in
the
wide
regions
of
the
new
world
it
was
ascertained
that
the
woman
who
had
accompanied
him
in
the
as
his
daughter
was
actually
his
wife
a
girl
whom
he
had
met
at
some
low
london
and
married
within
a
fortnight
of
his
introduction
to
her
it
is
possible
that
prudence
as
well
as
attachment
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
this
alliance
nowell
knew
that
once
united
to
him
in
the
bonds
of
holy
matrimony
the
accomplice
of
his
fraud
would
have
no
power
to
give
evidence
against
him
the
amount
which
he
had
contrived
to
secure
to
himself
by
this
plot
amounted
in
all
to
something
under
four
thousand
pounds
and
out
of
this
it
may
fairly
be
supposed
that
medler
claimed
a
considerable
percentage
the
only
information
that
gilbert
fenton
could
ever
obtain
from
america
was
of
a
shabby
swindler
arrested
in
a
in
one
of
the
more
remote
western
cities
whose
description
corresponded
pretty
closely
with
that
of
marian
father
there
comes
a
time
for
the
healing
of
all
griefs
the
cruel
wound
closes
at
last
though
the
scar
and
the
bitter
memory
of
the
stroke
may
remain
for
ever
there
came
a
time
some
years
after
john
saltram
death
when
gilbert
fenton
had
his
reward
and
if
the
woman
he
won
for
his
wife
in
these
latter
days
was
not
quite
the
fresh
young
beauty
he
had
wooed
under
the
in
captain
sedgewick
garden
she
was
still
infinitely
more
beautiful
than
all
other
women
in
his
eyes
she
was
still
the
dearest
and
best
and
brightest
and
purest
of
all
earthly
creatures
for
him
in
that
happy
time
that
perfect
summer
and
harvest
of
his
life
all
his
fondest
dreams
have
been
realized
he
has
the
home
he
so
often
pictured
the
children
whose
airy
voices
sounded
in
his
dreams
the
dear
face
always
near
him
and
sweeter
than
all
the
knowledge
that
he
is
loved
almost
as
he
loves
the
bitter
apprenticeship
has
been
served
and
the
full
reward
has
been
granted
for
ellen
whitelaw
too
has
come
the
period
of
compensation
and
the
farmer
worst
fears
have
been
realized
as
to
frank
participation
in
that
money
he
loved
so
well
the
income
grudgingly
left
to
his
wife
by
stephen
has
enabled
randall
to
begin
business
as
a
solicitor
upon
his
own
account
in
a
small
town
near
london
with
every
apparent
prospect
of
success
ellen
home
is
within
easy
reach
of
the
villa
occupied
by
and
fenton
so
she
is
able
to
see
her
dear
marian
as
often
as
she
likes
nor
is
there
any
guest
at
the
villa
more
welcome
than
this
faithful
friend
the
memoir
of
jonathan
swift
was
published
and
reviewers
who
had
no
compunction
in
praising
the
dead
were
quick
to
recognize
the
touch
of
a
master
hand
the
trenchant
style
of
a
powerful
thinker
for
the
public
the
book
is
of
no
great
value
it
is
merely
a
curiosity
of
literature
but
it
is
the
only
monument
of
his
own
rugged
genius
which
bears
the
name
of
john
saltram
poor
little
branston
has
not
sacrificed
all
the
joys
of
life
to
the
manes
of
her
faithless
lover
she
is
now
the
happy
wife
of
a
dashing
naval
officer
and
gives
pleasant
parties
which
bring
life
and
light
into
the
great
house
in
parties
to
which
theobald
pallinson
comes
and
where
he
shines
as
a
small
feeble
star
when
greater
lights
are
absent
singing
his
last
little
song
or
reciting
his
last
little
poem
for
the
delight
of
some
small
coterie
of
single
ladies
not
in
the
first
bloom
of
youth
but
parties
from
which
pallinson
keeps
aloof
in
a
stern
spirit
of
condemnation
informing
her
chosen
familiars
that
she
was
never
more
cruelly
deceived
than
in
that
misguided
ungrateful
young
woman
