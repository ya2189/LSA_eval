charles
garvice
at
love
cost
chapter
until
this
moment
i
have
never
fully
realised
how
great
an
ass
a
man
can
be
when
i
think
that
this
morning
i
scurried
through
what
might
have
been
a
decent
breakfast
left
my
comfortable
diggings
and
was
cooped
up
in
a
train
for
seven
hours
that
i
am
now
driving
in
a
pelting
rain
through
so
far
as
i
can
see
for
the
mist
what
appears
to
be
a
howling
wilderness
i
ask
myself
if
i
am
still
in
possession
of
my
senses
i
ask
myself
why
i
should
commit
such
lurid
folly
last
night
i
was
sitting
over
the
fire
with
a
book
for
it
was
cold
though
not
so
cold
as
this
the
speaker
shivered
and
dragged
the
collar
of
his
overcoat
still
higher
at
peace
with
all
the
world
with
omar
purring
placidly
by
my
side
and
my
soul
wrapped
in
that
serenity
which
belongs
to
a
man
who
has
long
since
rid
himself
of
that
inconvenient
appendage
a
conscience
and
has
hit
upon
the
right
brand
of
cigarettes
and
now
he
paused
to
sigh
to
groan
indeed
and
shifted
himself
uneasily
in
the
seat
of
the
luxurious
when
williams
brought
me
your
note
vilely
written
were
you
sober
stafford
blandly
asking
me
to
join
you
in
this
mad
business
i
smiled
to
myself
as
i
pitched
the
note
on
the
fire
omar
smiled
too
the
very
cigarette
smiled
i
said
to
myself
i
would
see
you
blowed
first
that
nothing
would
induce
me
to
join
you
that
i
read
about
the
lakes
too
much
and
too
often
to
venture
upon
them
in
the
early
part
of
june
in
fact
had
no
desire
to
see
the
lakes
at
any
time
or
under
any
conditions
i
told
omar
that
i
would
see
you
in
the
lowest
pit
of
tophet
before
i
would
go
with
you
to
whatever
the
name
of
this
place
is
and
yet
here
i
am
the
speaker
paused
in
his
complaint
to
empty
a
pool
water
from
his
mackintosh
and
succeeded
in
turning
it
over
his
own
leg
he
groaned
again
and
continued
and
yet
here
i
am
my
dear
stafford
i
do
not
wish
to
upbraid
you
i
am
simply
making
to
myself
a
confession
of
weakness
which
would
be
pitiable
in
a
stray
dog
but
which
in
a
man
of
my
years
with
my
experience
of
the
world
and
reputation
for
common
sense
is
simply
criminal
i
do
not
wish
to
reproach
you
i
am
quite
aware
that
no
reproach
not
even
the
spectacle
of
my
present
misery
would
touch
your
callous
and
permit
me
to
frankly
add
your
abominably
selfish
nature
but
i
do
want
to
ask
quite
calmly
and
without
any
display
of
temper
what
the
blazes
you
wanted
to
come
this
way
round
and
why
you
wanted
me
with
you
the
speaker
a
slightly
built
man
just
beyond
the
vague
line
of
young
glanced
up
with
his
dark
somewhat
sombre
and
yet
softly
cynical
eyes
at
the
face
of
his
companion
who
was
driving
this
companion
was
unmistakably
young
and
there
was
not
a
trace
of
cynicism
in
his
eyes
which
looked
out
upon
the
rain
and
mist
with
pleasant
cheerfulness
he
was
neither
particularly
fair
nor
dark
but
there
was
a
touch
of
brighter
colour
than
usual
in
his
short
crisp
hair
and
no
woman
had
yet
found
fault
with
the
moustache
or
the
lips
beneath
and
yet
though
stafford
orme
face
was
rather
too
handsome
than
otherwise
the
signs
of
weakness
which
one
sees
in
so
many
faces
did
not
mar
it
indeed
there
was
a
hint
of
strength
not
to
say
sternness
in
the
lips
a
glint
of
power
and
masterfulness
in
the
grey
eyes
and
the
brows
above
them
which
impressed
one
at
first
sight
though
when
one
came
to
know
him
the
impression
was
soon
lost
effaced
by
the
charm
for
which
stafford
was
famous
and
which
was
perpetually
recruiting
his
army
of
friends
no
doubt
it
is
easy
to
be
charming
when
the
gods
have
made
you
good
to
look
upon
and
have
filled
your
pockets
with
gold
into
the
bargain
life
was
a
pageant
of
pleasure
to
stafford
orme
no
wonder
he
sang
and
smiled
upon
the
way
and
had
no
lack
of
companions
even
this
man
beside
him
edmund
howard
whose
name
was
a
for
cynicism
who
had
never
until
he
had
met
stafford
orme
gone
an
inch
out
of
his
way
to
please
or
benefit
a
was
the
slave
of
the
young
fellow
imperious
will
and
though
he
made
burlesque
complaint
of
his
bondage
did
not
in
his
heart
rebel
against
it
stafford
laughed
shortly
as
he
looked
at
the
hills
round
which
the
two
good
horses
were
taking
the
phaeton
oh
i
knew
you
would
come
he
said
it
was
just
this
way
you
know
the
governor
wrote
and
asked
me
to
come
down
to
this
new
place
of
his
at
bryndermere
pardon
me
stafford
you
forget
that
i
have
been
down
south
where
i
wish
to
heaven
i
had
remained
and
that
i
only
returned
yesterday
afternoon
and
that
i
know
nothing
of
these
sudden
alarums
and
excursions
of
your
esteemed
parent
ah
no
so
you
do
assented
stafford
thought
i
told
you
shall
have
to
tell
you
now
i
cut
it
as
short
as
possible
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
gently
drew
the
lash
of
the
whip
over
the
wet
backs
of
the
two
horses
who
were
listening
intently
to
the
voice
of
their
beloved
master
well
three
days
ago
i
got
a
letter
from
my
father
it
was
a
long
one
i
think
it
the
first
long
letter
i
ever
received
from
him
he
informed
me
that
for
some
time
past
he
has
been
building
a
little
place
on
the
east
side
of
bryndermere
lake
that
he
thought
it
would
be
ready
by
the
ninth
of
this
month
and
would
i
go
down
or
is
it
up
there
and
meet
him
as
he
was
coming
to
england
and
would
go
straight
there
from
liverpool
of
course
there
was
not
time
for
me
to
reply
and
equally
of
course
i
prepared
to
obey
i
meant
going
straight
down
to
bryndermere
and
i
should
have
done
so
but
two
days
ago
i
received
a
telegram
telling
me
that
the
place
would
not
be
ready
and
that
he
would
not
be
there
until
the
eleventh
and
asking
me
to
fill
up
the
interval
by
sending
down
some
horses
and
carriages
it
occurred
to
me
with
one
of
those
brilliant
flashes
of
genius
which
you
have
so
often
remarked
in
me
my
dear
howard
that
i
would
drive
down
at
any
rate
part
of
the
way
so
i
sent
some
of
the
traps
direct
and
got
this
as
far
as
preston
with
me
with
another
of
those
remarkable
flashes
of
genius
it
also
occurred
to
me
that
i
should
be
devilish
lonely
with
only
pottinger
here
he
jerked
his
head
towards
the
groom
who
sat
in
damp
and
stolid
silence
behind
and
so
i
wrote
and
asked
you
to
come
kind
of
me
was
it
most
infernally
kind
said
howard
with
a
sigh
of
a
ton
weight
had
you
any
idea
that
your
father
was
building
this
little
place
by
the
way
i
ca
imagine
sir
stephen
building
anything
that
could
be
described
as
you
are
right
assented
stafford
with
a
nod
i
heard
coming
down
that
it
was
a
perfect
palace
of
a
place
a
kind
of
palace
of
art
and
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
the
governor
style
his
brows
were
slightly
knit
for
just
a
second
then
he
threw
as
it
were
the
frown
off
with
a
smile
no
i
knew
nothing
about
it
i
knew
as
little
about
it
as
i
do
of
the
governor
himself
and
his
affairs
howard
nodded
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
howard
is
it
strange
that
father
and
son
should
know
so
little
of
each
other
i
have
not
seen
the
governor
for
i
forget
how
many
years
he
has
been
out
of
england
for
the
last
fourteen
or
fifteen
with
the
exception
of
a
few
flying
visits
and
on
the
occasion
of
those
visits
i
was
either
at
school
on
the
continent
or
tramping
about
with
a
gun
or
a
rod
and
so
we
never
met
i
a
kind
of
uneasy
suspicion
that
my
revered
parent
had
no
particular
desire
to
renew
his
acquaintance
with
his
dutiful
offspring
anyway
if
he
had
he
would
have
arranged
a
meeting
seems
rather
peculiar
for
in
every
other
respect
his
conduct
as
a
parent
has
been
above
reproach
those
are
scarcely
the
terms
by
which
i
should
designate
a
liberality
which
can
only
be
described
as
criminally
lavish
and
an
indifference
to
your
moral
progress
which
might
more
properly
belong
to
an
unregenerate
turk
than
to
an
english
baronet
considering
the
opportunities
of
evil
afforded
you
by
the
possession
of
a
practically
unlimited
allowance
and
a
brazen
cheek
which
can
only
be
described
as
colossal
the
fact
that
you
have
not
long
since
gone
headlong
to
the
devil
fills
me
with
perpetual
and
wonder
stafford
yawned
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
cheerful
acquiescence
should
have
gone
a
mucker
ever
so
many
times
old
man
if
it
been
for
you
he
said
but
you
always
been
at
hand
just
at
the
critical
moment
to
point
out
to
me
that
i
was
playing
the
giddy
goat
and
going
to
smash
that
why
i
like
to
have
you
with
me
as
a
kind
of
guide
monitor
and
friend
you
know
howard
groaned
and
attempted
to
get
rid
of
another
miniature
pool
of
water
and
succeeded
as
before
i
know
he
assented
my
virtue
has
been
its
own
reward
and
punishment
if
i
had
allowed
you
to
go
your
way
to
the
proverbial
dogs
after
whose
society
gilded
youths
like
yourself
appear
to
be
always
hankering
i
should
not
be
sitting
here
with
cold
water
running
down
my
back
and
surrounded
by
nature
in
her
gloomiest
and
dampest
aspects
only
once
have
i
deviated
from
the
life
of
consistent
selfishness
at
which
every
sensible
man
should
aim
and
see
how
i
am
punished
i
do
not
wish
to
be
unduly
inquisitive
but
i
should
like
to
know
where
the
blazes
we
are
going
and
why
we
do
not
make
for
a
decent
hotel
if
there
is
such
a
thing
in
these
desolate
wilds
stafford
handed
him
the
reins
so
that
he
himself
might
get
out
his
and
with
some
little
difficulty
and
assisted
by
pottinger
soaked
hat
the
two
gentlemen
got
their
cigars
alight
there
is
a
decent
hotel
for
miles
explained
stafford
there
is
only
a
small
inn
at
a
little
place
called
carysford
i
looked
it
out
on
the
map
i
thought
we
drive
there
today
put
up
for
the
night
to
give
the
horses
a
rest
and
go
on
to
this
place
of
my
governor
the
next
day
it
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lake
he
jerked
his
whip
to
the
right
which
side
what
lake
asked
howard
hopelessly
i
see
nothing
of
the
lake
nothing
but
mist
and
sodden
hills
no
wonder
the
word
instinctively
arouses
one
animosity
when
i
think
of
the
number
of
and
inspired
idiots
who
have
written
reams
of
poetry
about
this
place
i
feel
at
this
present
moment
as
if
i
could
cheerfully
rend
even
a
wordsworth
a
southey
or
a
coleridge
and
i
look
back
with
remorse
upon
the
hours
the
throbs
of
admiration
i
have
expended
upon
what
i
once
deemed
their
inspired
pages
if
i
remember
rightly
most
of
the
lake
poets
went
off
their
heads
when
i
gaze
around
me
i
must
admit
that
i
am
not
surprised
stafford
laughed
absently
he
was
quite
accustomed
to
howard
cynical
vein
they
all
right
enough
he
said
that
is
i
suppose
they
are
for
i
never
read
any
of
since
i
left
school
oh
yes
they
right
enough
about
the
beauty
of
the
place
you
should
see
it
on
a
fine
day
has
anyone
seen
it
on
a
fine
day
inquired
howard
with
the
innocent
air
of
one
simply
seeking
information
i
asked
a
countryman
in
the
train
if
it
always
rained
here
and
he
replied
it
sometimes
snows
that
a
chestnut
remarked
stafford
with
a
laugh
but
it
all
nonsense
about
its
always
being
wet
here
they
tell
me
it
fine
for
weeks
together
that
you
can
never
tell
any
instant
whether
it
going
to
clear
up
or
not
that
the
weather
will
change
like
a
woman
good
heavens
look
at
that
he
nodded
to
the
east
as
he
spoke
unnoticed
by
them
the
sky
had
been
clearing
gradually
the
mists
sweeping
dissolving
away
a
breath
of
wind
now
wafted
them
like
a
veil
thrown
aside
from
hill
and
valley
and
lake
and
a
scene
of
unparalleled
beauty
lay
revealed
beneath
them
the
great
lake
shone
like
a
sapphire
meadows
of
emerald
woods
of
darker
green
hills
of
purple
and
grey
silver
and
gold
rose
from
the
bosom
and
the
edge
of
the
great
liquid
jewel
the
hills
towering
tier
on
tier
into
the
heavens
of
azure
blue
swept
by
clouds
like
drifting
snow
the
two
men
gazed
in
silence
even
pottinger
to
whom
his
generally
represented
all
that
was
beautiful
in
nature
gaped
with
mouth
how
that
for
lofty
you
unbeliever
demanded
stafford
ever
seen
anything
like
that
before
howard
had
been
considerably
startled
but
of
course
he
concealed
his
amazed
admiration
behind
a
mask
of
cynicism
rather
a
crib
from
val
prinsep
is
it
with
a
suggestion
of
a
drury
lane
pantomime
about
it
good
heavens
and
there
the
fairy
palace
all
complete
he
added
as
the
mists
still
rising
was
discovered
on
the
slope
of
the
other
side
a
long
and
extremely
ornate
building
the
pure
whiteness
of
which
was
reflected
in
the
marvellous
blue
and
opal
of
the
lake
can
that
be
sir
stephen
place
i
afraid
it
is
said
stafford
it
looks
like
the
governor
he
added
with
a
touch
of
gravity
well
it
very
big
or
rather
long
and
it
very
white
but
bound
to
admit
that
it
does
spoil
the
landscape
said
howard
in
fact
standing
there
amidst
the
trees
with
its
pinnacles
and
terraces
it
rather
an
ornament
than
otherwise
i
suppose
there
are
flowers
on
those
velvety
lawns
and
the
interior
i
wager
my
life
matches
the
exterior
fortunate
youth
to
possess
a
croesus
for
a
father
yes
i
suppose
the
governor
must
be
tremendously
oafish
said
stafford
the
man
who
can
build
such
a
palace
as
that
and
have
the
cool
cheek
to
call
it
little
place
must
in
common
decency
be
a
stafford
nodded
and
smoked
thoughtfully
for
a
minute
as
pottinger
left
the
horses
heads
and
climbed
into
his
seat
behind
and
the
moved
along
the
road
which
began
to
dip
down
at
this
point
i
know
so
little
about
my
father
he
said
again
and
yet
the
world
knows
so
much
remarked
howard
throwing
open
his
waterproof
and
basking
in
the
sun
which
shone
as
warmly
and
unreservedly
as
if
it
had
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
as
rain
one
ca
take
up
the
paper
without
seeing
some
mention
of
sir
stephen
orme
great
name
one
day
he
is
in
paris
negotiating
a
state
loan
another
you
read
he
is
annexing
appropriating
or
whatever
you
call
it
a
vast
tract
in
africa
or
asia
on
the
third
you
are
informed
with
all
solemnity
that
he
has
become
director
of
a
new
bank
insurance
company
or
one
of
those
vast
concerns
in
which
only
rothschilds
and
barings
can
disport
themselves
now
and
again
you
are
informed
that
sir
stephen
orme
has
been
requested
to
stand
for
an
important
constituency
but
that
he
was
compelled
to
decline
because
of
the
pressure
of
his
numerous
affairs
there
may
be
a
more
famous
and
important
individual
in
the
world
than
your
father
my
dear
stafford
but
i
ca
call
him
to
mind
at
this
moment
chaff
away
said
stafford
at
any
rate
he
has
been
a
jolly
liberal
father
to
me
did
i
tell
you
that
just
before
he
came
home
be
placed
a
largish
sum
at
his
bank
for
me
i
mean
over
and
above
my
allowance
you
did
tell
me
but
i
not
at
all
surprised
responded
howard
a
truly
wonderful
father
and
a
model
to
all
other
parents
would
that
i
possessed
such
a
one
you
do
remember
your
mother
stafford
the
young
fellow
handsome
face
softened
for
an
instant
and
his
voice
was
low
and
grave
as
he
replied
no
and
yet
sometimes
i
fancy
that
i
do
though
seeing
that
she
died
when
i
was
quite
a
kid
it
must
be
only
fancy
i
wish
she
lived
his
voice
became
still
lower
i
wish
i
had
a
brother
or
a
sister
especially
a
sister
by
george
that
a
fine
stream
did
you
see
that
fish
jump
howard
no
i
was
too
much
occupied
in
jumping
myself
i
thought
by
your
exclamation
that
something
had
happened
to
the
carriage
or
the
horses
and
that
we
were
on
the
verge
of
a
let
it
jump
if
it
amuses
it
so
it
may
if
i
do
catch
it
said
stafford
pulling
up
the
horses
near
the
bank
of
the
stream
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
are
going
to
fish
demanded
howard
with
a
groan
my
dear
stafford
i
know
that
being
that
abominable
thing
a
sportsman
you
are
consequently
mad
but
you
might
have
the
decency
to
curb
your
insanity
out
of
consideration
for
the
wretched
man
who
has
the
misfortune
to
be
your
companion
and
who
plainly
sees
that
this
period
of
sunshine
is
a
gilded
fraud
and
that
presently
it
will
rain
again
like
cats
and
dogs
stafford
laughed
he
had
got
down
and
dragged
out
a
rod
and
a
sorry
old
chap
he
said
but
no
fisherman
could
lose
such
a
chance
as
this
even
to
save
his
best
friend
from
rheumatic
fever
i
thought
we
should
come
across
a
stream
or
two
and
i
put
on
these
togs
accordingly
he
wore
a
norfolk
suit
of
that
wonderful
harris
tweed
which
strange
to
say
keeps
out
the
rain
the
heat
and
the
cold
and
flies
were
stuck
in
his
cap
of
the
same
material
but
look
here
there
no
need
for
me
to
keep
you
pottinger
will
drive
you
to
this
place
carysford
where
we
stay
the
night
i
engaged
rooms
and
you
can
have
a
warm
bath
and
get
into
the
after
which
you
are
hankering
when
i
caught
a
fish
or
two
i
come
on
after
you
argue
now
my
dear
stafford
i
have
the
least
intention
of
doing
so
simply
dying
for
a
bath
a
change
and
a
huge
fire
and
when
you
arrive
you
find
me
sitting
over
the
latter
humbly
thanking
god
that
i
not
a
sportsman
stafford
nodded
with
his
eyes
on
the
stream
i
should
give
the
nags
some
gruel
pottinger
and
put
an
extra
coat
on
them
it
be
cold
ta
ta
howard
tell
to
get
a
nice
dinner
i
be
there
in
time
for
to
cook
the
fish
but
do
wait
if
i
should
be
late
say
half
past
seven
i
promise
you
i
wo
retorted
howard
fervently
and
i
am
one
of
those
men
who
never
break
a
promise
unless
it
inconvenient
the
phaeton
drove
on
stafford
went
down
to
the
stream
put
up
his
rod
chose
a
fly
as
carefully
as
if
the
fate
of
a
kingdom
depended
on
it
and
began
to
fish
there
is
this
great
advantage
in
the
art
of
that
while
you
are
engaged
in
it
you
can
think
of
nothing
else
it
is
as
absorbing
as
love
or
scarlet
fever
stafford
worked
his
fly
steadily
and
systematically
with
a
light
and
long
cast
which
had
made
him
famous
with
the
brethren
of
the
craft
and
presently
he
landed
a
glittering
trout
which
though
only
a
pound
in
weight
was
valued
by
stafford
at
many
a
pound
in
gold
the
fish
began
to
rise
freely
and
he
was
so
engrossed
in
the
sport
that
he
did
not
notice
that
howard
prophecy
had
come
true
that
the
mist
had
swept
over
the
landscape
again
and
that
it
was
raining
if
not
exactly
cats
and
dogs
yet
hard
enough
to
make
even
the
opposite
bank
a
blur
in
his
vision
but
stafford
was
utterly
indifferent
to
rain
and
mist
while
the
trout
were
rising
and
his
basket
was
half
full
before
he
looked
around
him
it
is
wonderful
when
you
are
fishing
how
great
a
distance
you
can
walk
without
noticing
it
he
had
followed
the
winding
course
of
the
stream
until
it
had
left
the
road
far
behind
and
struck
into
a
valley
the
wildness
the
remoteness
of
which
was
almost
and
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
and
looked
up
at
the
sky
into
which
the
tall
sharp
peaks
of
the
hills
lost
themselves
the
stream
broken
by
huge
boulders
rumbled
with
a
soft
roar
which
was
the
only
sound
that
broke
the
stillness
it
was
the
silence
a
profound
stillness
which
makes
one
feel
as
if
one
has
wandered
into
an
unknown
world
newly
made
and
as
yet
untouched
by
the
foot
of
man
unsullied
by
his
presence
stafford
could
not
have
quoted
a
verse
of
poetry
to
save
his
life
it
was
in
his
line
he
could
ride
straight
was
a
shot
waltzed
like
an
angel
and
so
far
his
dictionary
did
not
contain
the
word
fear
but
he
knew
nothing
of
poetry
or
art
and
only
liked
some
kinds
of
music
amongst
which
it
is
to
be
feared
soldiers
of
the
queen
and
the
now
chorus
from
faust
ranked
high
in
his
estimation
he
was
just
simply
a
healthy
young
englishman
and
with
a
tremendous
appetite
for
pleasure
a
magnificent
frame
and
a
heart
as
light
and
buoyant
as
a
cork
therefore
though
an
artist
or
a
poet
would
have
been
thrilled
to
the
marrow
by
the
wild
grandeur
of
the
secluded
valley
and
the
grimly
towering
hills
and
would
have
longed
to
put
them
on
canvas
or
into
verse
stafford
only
felt
suddenly
grave
and
as
if
it
were
playing
it
low
down
to
throw
an
artificial
fly
even
of
the
best
make
in
such
a
spot
but
in
a
moment
or
two
the
sportsman
instinct
woke
in
him
a
fish
stirred
in
a
pool
under
a
boulder
and
pulling
himself
together
he
threw
a
fly
over
the
rise
as
he
did
so
the
brooding
silence
was
broken
by
the
deep
musical
bark
of
a
collie
followed
by
the
sharp
yap
yap
of
a
the
sudden
sound
almost
startled
stafford
at
any
rate
caused
him
to
miss
his
fish
he
looked
up
with
a
little
frown
of
annoyance
and
saw
on
the
break
of
the
opposite
hill
some
of
the
mountain
sheep
which
had
stared
at
him
with
haughty
curiosity
running
down
towards
the
green
bottom
of
the
valley
followed
by
the
two
dogs
a
moment
afterwards
a
horse
and
rider
were
silhouetted
on
the
extreme
top
of
the
high
hill
the
horse
was
large
whereby
the
rider
looked
small
and
for
a
moment
the
pair
were
motionless
reminding
stafford
of
a
bronze
statue
the
hill
was
fearfully
steep
even
the
dogs
ran
with
a
certain
amount
of
caution
and
stafford
wondered
whether
the
rider
he
could
see
if
it
was
man
or
boy
would
venture
down
the
almost
precipitous
slope
while
he
was
wondering
the
small
figure
on
the
horse
sent
up
a
cry
that
rang
like
the
note
of
a
bell
and
echoed
in
sweet
shrillness
down
the
hill
and
along
the
valley
the
collie
stopped
as
if
shot
and
the
looked
round
prepared
to
go
back
to
the
rider
it
looked
for
a
moment
as
if
the
rider
were
going
down
the
other
side
of
the
hill
again
then
suddenly
as
if
he
detected
something
wrong
in
the
valley
below
he
turned
the
horse
and
came
down
the
at
a
pace
which
made
stafford
hard
and
fearless
rider
as
he
was
open
his
eyes
it
seemed
to
him
impossible
that
the
horse
could
avoid
a
false
step
or
a
slip
and
such
a
false
step
he
knew
would
send
steed
and
rider
hurtling
down
to
something
that
could
be
very
little
short
of
instant
death
he
forgot
all
about
the
big
trout
in
the
pool
and
stood
with
his
fly
drifting
aimlessly
in
the
water
watching
with
something
like
breathless
interest
this
the
most
daring
piece
of
horsemanship
he
had
ever
witnessed
and
he
had
ridden
side
by
side
with
the
best
steeplechaser
of
the
day
and
had
watched
a
crack
hungarian
cavalry
corps
at
its
manoeuvres
which
last
is
about
the
top
notch
of
the
business
but
the
big
horse
did
not
falter
for
a
moment
down
it
came
at
a
hard
gallop
and
stafford
admiration
was
swallowed
up
in
amazement
when
he
saw
that
the
rider
was
a
young
girl
that
she
was
riding
with
about
half
an
ounce
on
the
reins
and
that
apparently
she
was
as
much
at
ease
and
unconscious
of
danger
as
if
she
were
trotting
on
a
tame
hack
in
rotten
row
as
she
came
nearer
admiration
romped
in
ahead
of
amazement
for
the
girl
was
a
young
one
she
looked
like
the
average
and
had
one
of
the
most
beautiful
faces
stafford
had
ever
seen
she
was
dark
but
the
cheek
that
was
swept
by
the
long
lashes
was
colourless
with
that
exquisite
and
healthy
pallor
which
one
sees
in
the
women
of
northern
spain
her
hair
was
black
but
soft
and
silky
and
the
wind
blew
it
in
soft
tendrils
now
across
her
brow
and
now
in
dazzling
strands
about
the
soft
felt
hat
which
sat
in
graceful
negligence
upon
the
small
and
stately
head
she
wore
a
habit
stained
by
use
and
weather
and
so
short
that
it
was
little
better
than
a
skirt
and
left
her
almost
as
absolute
a
freedom
as
that
enjoyed
by
the
opposite
sex
her
hands
were
covered
by
gauntlets
and
she
held
a
stout
and
crop
with
a
long
huntsman
thong
a
poet
would
instantly
have
thought
that
it
was
a
vision
of
the
spirit
of
the
mountains
stafford
only
thought
it
was
the
most
lovely
piece
of
girlhood
he
had
ever
looked
at
she
did
not
see
him
for
a
moment
all
her
attention
being
engrossed
by
the
sheep
which
were
now
wandering
up
the
valley
then
suddenly
as
if
she
felt
his
presence
rather
than
saw
it
her
dark
eyes
flashed
round
upon
him
and
she
pulled
up
the
big
horse
on
its
haunches
with
a
suddenness
which
ought
to
have
sent
her
from
the
saddle
like
a
stone
from
a
catapult
but
she
sat
back
as
firm
as
a
rock
and
gazed
at
him
steadily
with
a
calmness
which
fascinated
stafford
and
kept
him
staring
back
at
her
as
if
he
were
the
veriest
and
to
put
it
frankly
it
was
something
like
fascination
she
had
come
upon
him
so
suddenly
her
feat
of
horsemanship
had
been
so
audacious
her
beauty
was
so
marvellous
that
stafford
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
found
himself
unable
to
utter
a
word
in
the
presence
of
one
of
the
opposite
sex
it
was
only
for
a
moment
or
two
of
course
that
he
lost
his
presence
of
mind
then
he
pulled
himself
together
and
raised
his
cap
she
gave
him
the
very
slightest
of
bows
it
was
the
faintest
indication
only
of
response
to
his
salute
her
eyes
rested
on
his
face
with
a
strange
ungirlish
calm
then
wandered
to
the
last
trout
which
lay
on
the
bank
stafford
felt
that
something
had
to
be
said
but
for
the
life
of
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
experience
he
could
hit
upon
the
thing
to
say
seemed
to
him
too
banal
commonplace
and
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
for
a
moment
however
it
came
at
last
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
if
i
am
far
from
carysford
he
asked
four
miles
and
by
the
road
three
miles
over
the
hill
she
replied
slowly
as
calmly
as
she
had
looked
at
him
and
in
a
voice
low
and
sweet
and
with
a
ring
a
tone
in
it
which
in
some
indefinable
way
harmonised
with
her
appearance
it
was
quite
unlike
the
conventional
girl
voice
there
rang
in
it
the
freedom
of
the
lonely
valley
the
towering
hills
the
freedom
and
unconventionality
of
the
girl
own
figure
and
face
and
hair
and
in
it
was
a
note
of
dignity
of
independence
and
of
a
pride
which
was
too
proud
for
defiance
in
its
way
the
voice
was
as
remarkable
as
the
beauty
of
the
face
the
soft
fire
of
the
dark
eyes
i
had
no
idea
it
was
so
far
said
stafford
i
must
have
wandered
away
from
the
place
i
started
fishing
on
the
road
down
below
and
have
noticed
the
distance
will
you
tell
me
the
name
of
this
place
herondale
she
replied
thank
you
said
stafford
it
a
grand
valley
and
a
splendid
stream
she
leant
forward
with
her
elbow
on
the
saddle
and
her
chin
in
the
small
gauntletted
hand
looked
up
the
valley
absently
and
then
back
at
him
with
a
frank
speculation
in
her
eyes
which
was
too
frank
and
calm
to
be
flattering
and
was
indeed
somewhat
embarrassing
i
suppose
she
takes
me
for
a
tourist
or
a
cheap
tripper
thought
stafford
with
an
uncomfortable
kind
of
amusement
uncomfortable
because
he
knew
that
this
girl
who
was
acting
as
shepherd
in
an
old
habit
and
a
battered
hat
was
a
lady
she
broke
the
silence
again
have
you
caught
many
fish
she
asked
up
to
now
they
had
been
separated
by
the
stream
stafford
seized
the
opportunity
waded
across
in
a
fairly
shallow
place
and
opening
the
lid
of
his
basket
showed
her
the
contents
yes
you
have
done
fairly
well
she
said
but
the
trout
run
larger
higher
up
the
valley
by
the
way
her
brows
came
together
slightly
though
the
very
faintest
of
smiles
for
an
instant
curved
the
delicately
cut
lips
do
you
know
that
you
are
poaching
this
would
have
been
a
staggerer
coming
from
a
mere
keeper
but
from
this
exquisitely
beautiful
this
calm
statue
of
a
girl
it
was
simply
devastating
stafford
stared
at
her
does
this
river
belong
to
sir
joseph
avory
he
asked
no
she
replied
uncompromisingly
sir
joseph
avory
river
is
called
the
lesset
water
and
runs
on
the
other
side
of
that
hill
she
raised
her
and
pointed
with
an
exquisite
movement
as
graceful
as
that
of
a
diana
to
the
hill
behind
her
i
am
very
sorry
said
stafford
i
thought
this
was
his
river
i
met
him
in
london
and
got
permission
from
him
do
you
know
to
whom
this
water
belongs
to
heron
of
herondale
she
replied
i
beg
heron
pardon
said
stafford
of
course
i
put
up
my
rod
at
once
and
i
will
take
the
first
opportunity
of
apologising
for
my
crime
for
poaching
is
a
crime
is
it
yes
she
assented
laconically
can
you
tell
me
where
he
lives
where
his
house
is
she
raised
her
whip
again
and
pointed
to
an
opening
on
the
left
of
the
valley
an
opening
lined
on
either
side
by
a
wild
growth
of
magnificent
firs
it
is
up
there
you
can
not
see
it
from
here
she
said
as
she
spoke
she
took
her
chin
from
her
hand
and
sat
upright
gathered
up
her
reins
and
with
another
of
the
faint
inclinations
of
her
head
by
way
of
adieu
rode
on
up
the
valley
stafford
stood
with
his
cap
in
his
hand
looking
after
her
for
a
moment
in
a
brown
study
and
still
watching
the
back
of
the
slight
figure
that
sat
the
big
horse
with
the
grace
of
an
indian
maiden
he
began
to
take
down
his
rod
and
having
packed
it
in
his
case
and
fastened
his
basket
he
followed
her
along
the
broken
bank
of
the
stream
presently
when
she
had
gone
some
little
distance
he
heard
the
dogs
start
barking
again
the
crack
of
her
whip
rang
like
a
and
her
voice
echoed
amongst
the
hills
joined
with
the
troubled
baaing
of
the
sheep
stafford
stopped
and
watched
her
there
was
evidently
something
wrong
for
the
dogs
had
become
excited
the
sheep
were
running
wildly
but
the
girl
exquisite
voice
was
as
clear
and
calm
as
ever
and
the
big
horse
cantered
over
the
broken
ground
taking
a
big
boulder
now
and
again
with
lilting
jump
as
if
he
were
going
by
his
own
volition
and
was
well
up
in
all
the
points
of
the
game
after
a
time
the
dogs
got
the
sheep
into
a
heap
and
the
young
girl
rode
round
them
but
something
still
seemed
to
be
wrong
for
she
got
down
and
leaving
the
horse
quite
free
made
her
way
into
the
flock
at
that
moment
stafford
saw
a
sheep
and
a
lamb
break
from
the
mob
and
make
for
the
stream
the
sheep
jumped
to
a
boulder
with
the
agility
of
a
goat
the
lamb
attempted
to
follow
but
missed
the
boulder
and
fell
into
the
stream
the
water
was
wild
here
and
the
pools
deep
and
as
the
lamb
was
swept
down
toward
stafford
he
saw
that
it
was
struggling
in
an
ineffectual
way
and
that
it
looked
like
a
case
of
drowning
of
course
he
went
for
it
at
once
and
wading
in
made
a
grab
at
it
he
got
hold
of
it
easily
enough
but
the
lamb
a
good
sized
one
struggled
and
in
the
effort
to
retain
his
hold
stafford
feet
slipped
and
he
went
headfirst
into
a
deep
pool
he
was
submerged
for
a
second
only
and
when
he
came
up
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
he
had
still
got
the
lamb
and
gripping
the
struggling
thing
tightly
in
his
arms
he
made
for
the
opposite
bank
and
looking
up
saw
the
girl
standing
waiting
for
him
her
face
alive
alight
dancing
with
delight
and
amusement
the
laughter
shone
in
her
eyes
like
dazzling
sunlight
and
quivered
on
the
firm
but
delicate
lips
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
before
stafford
had
fully
taken
it
in
and
had
responded
to
it
with
one
of
his
own
short
laughs
her
face
was
grave
and
calm
again
thank
you
she
said
with
a
gravity
matching
her
face
and
very
much
as
one
is
thanked
for
passing
the
salt
it
would
have
drowned
if
you
had
not
been
there
it
is
lame
and
could
swim
i
saw
from
the
top
of
the
hill
that
it
was
lame
and
i
was
afraid
something
would
happen
to
it
as
she
spoke
she
took
the
lamb
which
was
bleating
like
mad
laid
it
on
the
ground
and
holding
it
still
firmly
but
gently
with
her
knee
examined
it
with
all
the
confidence
and
coolness
of
a
vet
you
make
yourself
most
frightfully
wet
said
stafford
she
glanced
up
at
him
with
only
faint
surprise
you
are
a
londoner
she
said
or
you
would
know
that
here
in
these
parts
we
are
so
often
more
wet
than
dry
that
it
makes
no
matter
yes
i
thought
so
there
was
a
thorn
in
its
foot
may
i
trouble
you
to
hold
him
a
minute
stafford
held
the
lamb
which
was
tolerably
quiet
now
and
she
slowly
took
off
her
gauntlets
produced
a
little
leather
wallet
from
the
saddle
the
horse
coming
at
her
call
as
if
he
were
a
dog
took
out
a
serviceable
pair
of
tweezers
and
with
professional
neatness
extracted
an
extremely
ugly
thorn
stafford
stood
and
watched
her
the
collie
and
the
upright
on
their
haunches
watching
her
also
the
collie
gave
an
approving
bark
as
with
a
pat
she
liberated
the
lamb
which
went
bleating
on
its
way
to
join
its
distracted
mother
the
leapt
round
her
with
yaps
of
excited
admiration
and
there
was
admiration
in
stafford
eyes
also
the
whole
thing
had
been
done
with
a
calm
almost
savage
grace
and
and
she
seemed
to
be
absolutely
unconscious
of
his
presence
and
only
remembered
it
when
the
lamb
and
its
mother
had
joined
the
flock
thank
you
again
she
said
it
was
very
kind
of
you
i
am
afraid
you
are
wet
as
stafford
had
gone
completely
under
the
water
this
was
a
fact
he
could
not
deny
but
he
said
with
a
laugh
though
i
am
a
londoner
in
a
sense
i
do
mind
a
wetting
in
a
good
cause
and
i
shall
be
dry
or
as
good
as
dry
before
i
get
to
the
inn
you
must
have
eyes
like
a
hawk
to
have
seen
from
the
top
of
the
hill
that
that
lamb
was
lame
he
added
rather
with
the
desire
to
keep
her
than
to
express
his
admiration
for
her
sight
i
have
good
eyes
she
said
indifferently
one
has
to
have
but
i
saw
that
the
lamb
was
lame
from
the
way
it
kept
beside
its
mother
and
the
fuss
she
made
over
it
and
i
knew
too
by
donald
bark
that
something
was
wrong
i
am
sorry
you
are
wet
will
you
she
glanced
towards
the
opening
in
the
hills
paused
and
for
the
first
time
seemed
slightly
embarrassed
stafford
fancied
that
a
faint
touch
of
colour
came
to
the
clear
pallor
of
the
lovely
young
face
she
did
not
finish
the
sentence
but
with
another
thank
you
and
i
should
not
have
liked
to
have
lost
the
lamb
went
towards
her
horse
stafford
advanced
to
put
her
in
the
saddle
but
with
a
little
shake
of
the
head
and
a
do
trouble
she
sprang
into
her
place
and
rode
off
stafford
looked
after
her
as
he
had
done
before
then
he
said
well
i
d
he
felt
for
his
pouch
filled
his
pipe
and
lit
it
and
in
doing
so
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
little
wallet
from
which
she
had
taken
her
tweezers
he
picked
it
up
and
quickly
shouted
to
her
but
the
dogs
were
barking
with
furious
delight
she
was
cracking
her
whip
and
she
had
ridden
too
far
for
her
to
hear
him
through
the
noise
it
would
have
been
sheer
folly
to
have
run
after
her
so
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
stafford
put
the
little
wallet
in
his
pocket
waded
the
stream
and
after
a
moment
or
two
of
consideration
made
for
the
inn
by
the
nearest
way
to
wit
across
the
hill
the
girl
rode
along
the
strip
of
level
moorland
beside
the
river
until
she
came
to
a
narrow
and
not
particularly
well
kept
road
which
led
through
the
opening
of
the
hills
towards
which
she
had
motioned
her
whip
once
or
twice
a
smile
crossed
her
face
and
once
she
laughed
as
she
thought
of
the
comical
picture
which
the
young
man
had
made
as
he
struggled
to
dry
land
with
the
wet
lamb
in
his
arms
and
the
smile
and
her
laugh
made
her
face
seem
strangely
girlish
because
it
was
usually
so
calm
so
gravely
some
girls
would
have
been
quick
to
detect
the
romantic
side
of
the
incident
and
would
have
dwelt
with
a
certain
sense
of
satisfaction
upon
the
fact
that
the
young
man
was
tall
and
handsome
and
distinguished
looking
but
this
girl
had
scarcely
noticed
it
at
any
rate
it
had
not
affected
her
in
any
way
she
had
too
much
to
do
there
was
too
much
upon
her
and
graceful
shoulders
to
permit
her
to
indulge
in
romance
diana
herself
was
not
more
free
from
sentiment
than
this
young
girl
who
rode
her
horse
just
like
a
mexican
who
was
vet
enough
to
perform
a
surgical
operation
on
a
lamb
and
who
knew
how
many
bushels
of
wheat
should
run
to
an
acre
and
the
best
dressing
for
permanent
pastures
it
did
occur
to
her
that
she
might
at
any
rate
after
he
had
rescued
the
lamb
have
given
him
permission
to
go
on
fishing
but
she
was
not
very
sorry
for
having
failed
to
do
so
for
after
all
he
had
been
poaching
and
as
she
had
said
poaching
was
in
her
eyes
a
crime
she
went
down
the
road
at
a
swift
trot
and
presently
it
was
blocked
by
a
pair
of
gates
so
exquisite
in
their
antique
conscientiousness
that
many
a
mushroom
peer
would
have
given
almost
their
weight
in
gold
to
place
them
at
the
beginning
of
his
newly
made
park
but
no
one
came
to
open
them
they
were
closed
by
a
heavily
padlocked
chain
and
the
lodge
beside
them
was
empty
and
dilapidated
and
the
girl
rode
beside
the
wall
in
which
they
stood
until
she
came
to
an
opening
leading
to
an
old
arch
which
faced
a
broad
and
spacious
as
she
rode
beneath
the
arch
a
number
of
dogs
yelped
a
welcome
from
kennels
or
behind
stable
and
a
bent
old
man
dressed
like
something
between
a
stableman
and
a
butler
came
forward
touching
his
forehead
to
take
her
horse
she
slipped
from
the
saddle
patted
the
horse
and
murmured
a
word
or
two
of
endearment
but
her
bright
eyes
flashed
round
the
with
a
glance
of
responsibility
have
you
brought
the
colt
in
jason
she
asked
jason
touched
his
forehead
again
yes
miss
ida
it
took
me
of
an
hour
it
wo
come
to
me
like
it
does
to
you
it
in
a
loose
stall
saddle
it
morning
she
said
and
i
will
come
and
try
it
the
brindle
cow
has
got
into
the
corn
and
the
fence
wants
mending
down
by
the
pool
you
must
get
william
to
help
you
and
do
it
at
once
he
has
taken
the
steers
to
market
i
suppose
i
did
see
them
in
the
three
acre
oh
and
jason
i
found
someone
fishing
in
the
dale
you
must
get
a
notice
board
and
put
it
up
where
the
road
runs
near
the
river
the
tourists
time
is
coming
on
and
though
they
do
often
come
this
side
of
the
lake
some
of
them
may
and
we
ca
afford
to
have
the
river
poached
and
jason
look
to
ruppert
shoe
i
think
it
loose
and
she
stopped
with
a
short
laugh
but
enough
for
one
time
is
it
oh
jason
if
i
were
only
a
man
how
much
better
it
would
be
yes
miss
assented
jason
simply
with
another
touch
of
his
forehead
she
sighed
and
laughed
again
and
gathering
up
her
habit
she
had
to
raise
it
much
she
went
through
an
open
into
a
wild
but
pretty
garden
and
so
to
the
back
of
one
of
the
most
picturesque
houses
in
this
land
of
the
picturesque
it
was
built
of
grey
stone
which
age
had
coloured
with
a
tender
and
an
appreciative
hand
a
rich
growth
of
ivy
and
clematis
clung
lovingly
over
a
greater
portion
of
it
so
that
the
mullioned
windows
were
framed
by
the
dark
leaves
and
the
purple
flower
the
house
was
long
and
rambling
and
had
once
been
flourishing
and
important
but
it
was
now
eloquent
of
decay
and
pathetic
with
the
signs
of
better
times
that
had
vanished
long
ago
a
flight
of
worn
steps
led
to
a
broad
glass
door
and
opening
the
latter
the
girl
passed
under
a
curved
wooden
gallery
into
a
broad
hall
it
was
dimly
lit
by
an
oriel
window
of
stained
glass
over
which
the
ivy
and
clematis
had
been
allowed
to
fall
there
was
that
faint
odour
which
emanates
from
old
wood
and
leather
and
damask
the
furniture
was
antique
and
of
the
neutral
tint
which
comes
from
age
the
weapons
and
the
ornaments
of
brass
the
gilding
of
the
great
pictures
were
all
dim
and
for
want
of
the
cleaning
and
polishing
which
require
many
servants
in
the
huge
some
big
logs
were
burning
and
donald
and
bess
threw
themselves
down
before
it
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
the
girl
looked
round
her
just
as
she
had
looked
round
the
then
tossing
her
soft
hat
and
whip
on
the
old
oak
table
she
went
to
one
of
the
large
heavy
doors
and
knocking
said
in
her
clear
voice
father
are
you
there
inside
the
room
an
old
man
sat
at
a
table
it
was
littered
with
books
some
of
them
open
as
if
he
had
been
consulting
them
but
before
him
lay
an
open
deed
and
at
his
elbow
were
several
others
lying
on
an
open
he
was
thin
and
as
and
as
worn
with
age
as
the
house
and
the
room
lined
with
dusty
volumes
and
yellow
maps
and
pictures
he
wore
a
long
which
was
huddled
round
him
as
if
he
were
cold
though
a
fire
of
logs
almost
as
large
as
the
one
in
the
hall
was
burning
in
the
open
at
the
sound
of
the
knock
he
raised
his
head
an
expression
which
was
a
mixture
of
fear
and
senile
cunning
came
into
his
lined
and
pallid
face
his
dull
eyes
peered
from
under
their
lids
with
a
flash
of
sudden
alertness
and
with
one
motion
of
his
long
hands
he
hurriedly
folded
the
deed
before
him
crammed
it
with
the
others
into
the
box
locked
it
with
a
hurried
and
trembling
hand
and
placed
it
in
a
cupboard
which
he
also
locked
then
he
drew
one
of
the
large
books
into
the
place
were
the
deed
had
been
and
with
a
cautious
glance
round
the
room
shuffled
to
the
door
and
opened
it
as
the
girl
entered
one
would
have
noticed
the
resemblance
between
her
and
the
old
man
and
have
seen
that
they
were
father
and
daughter
for
godfrey
heron
had
been
one
of
the
handsomest
men
of
his
time
and
though
she
had
got
her
dark
eyes
and
the
firm
delicate
lips
from
her
mother
the
clear
oval
of
her
face
and
its
expression
of
aristocratic
pride
had
come
from
the
herons
are
you
here
still
father
she
said
it
is
nearly
and
you
are
not
dressed
you
promised
me
that
you
would
go
out
how
wicked
of
you
not
to
have
done
so
he
shuffled
back
to
the
table
and
made
a
great
business
of
closing
the
book
i
been
busy
reading
ida
he
said
i
did
not
know
it
was
so
late
you
have
been
out
i
see
i
hope
you
have
enjoyed
your
ride
have
you
met
anyone
no
she
replied
then
she
smiled
as
she
added
only
a
poacher
the
old
man
raised
his
head
a
faint
flush
came
on
his
face
and
his
eyes
flashed
with
haughty
resentment
a
poacher
what
are
the
keepers
about
ah
i
forgot
there
are
no
keepers
now
any
vagrant
is
free
to
trespass
and
poach
on
herondale
i
sorry
father
she
said
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
soothingly
it
was
not
an
ordinary
poacher
only
a
gentleman
who
had
mistaken
the
heron
water
for
the
avory
come
now
father
you
have
barely
time
to
dress
yes
yes
i
will
come
in
a
moment
a
moment
he
said
but
after
she
had
left
the
room
he
still
lingered
and
when
at
last
he
got
to
the
door
he
closed
it
and
went
back
to
the
cupboard
and
tried
it
to
see
if
it
were
locked
muttering
suspiciously
did
she
hear
me
she
might
have
heard
the
rustle
of
the
parchment
the
turn
of
the
lock
sometimes
i
think
she
suspects
but
no
no
she
a
child
still
and
she
say
something
speak
out
no
no
it
all
right
yes
yes
i
coming
ida
he
said
aloud
as
the
girl
called
to
him
on
her
way
up
the
stairs
chapter
ii
as
stafford
climbed
the
hill
steadily
he
wondered
who
the
girl
was
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
she
might
be
the
daughter
of
the
heron
to
whom
the
stream
belonged
and
from
whose
family
name
the
whole
dale
had
taken
its
own
for
though
she
had
looked
and
spoken
like
a
lady
the
habit
the
gauntlets
the
soft
felt
hat
were
old
and
and
her
familiarity
with
the
proper
treatment
of
a
sheep
in
difficulty
indicated
rather
the
farmer
daughter
than
that
of
the
squire
she
was
not
by
any
means
the
first
pretty
girl
stafford
had
seen
he
had
a
very
large
acquaintance
in
london
and
one
or
two
women
whose
beauty
had
been
blazoned
by
the
world
were
more
than
friendly
with
the
popular
stafford
orme
but
he
thought
as
he
went
up
the
hill
which
seemed
to
have
no
end
that
he
had
never
seen
a
more
beautiful
face
than
this
girl
certainly
he
had
never
seen
one
which
had
impressed
him
more
deeply
perhaps
it
was
the
character
of
the
loveliness
which
haunted
him
so
persistently
it
was
so
unlike
the
conventional
type
with
which
he
was
so
familiar
as
he
thought
of
her
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
like
a
wild
and
graceful
deer
one
of
the
deer
which
he
had
seen
coming
down
to
a
mountain
stream
to
drink
on
his
father
scotch
moor
hers
was
a
wild
almost
savage
loveliness
and
yet
not
savage
for
there
had
been
the
refinement
the
dignity
of
high
race
in
the
exquisite
grey
eyes
the
curve
of
the
finely
cut
lips
her
manner
also
prevented
him
from
forgetting
her
he
had
never
met
with
anything
like
it
she
had
been
as
calm
and
as
a
woman
of
forty
and
yet
her
attitude
as
she
leant
forward
in
the
saddle
her
directness
of
speech
all
her
movements
had
the
of
an
unconscious
child
indeed
the
absence
of
her
absolute
freedom
from
anything
like
shyness
combined
with
a
dignity
a
touch
of
hauteur
and
pride
struck
him
as
extraordinary
almost
weird
stafford
was
not
one
of
your
susceptible
young
men
in
fact
there
was
a
touch
of
coldness
of
indifference
to
the
other
sex
which
often
troubled
his
and
he
was
rather
surprised
at
himself
for
the
interest
which
the
girl
had
aroused
in
him
he
wondered
if
he
should
meet
her
again
and
was
conscious
of
a
strong
almost
a
very
strong
desire
to
do
so
which
he
admitted
to
himself
was
strange
for
he
did
not
at
that
moment
remember
any
girl
whom
at
his
first
meeting
with
her
he
had
hankered
to
see
again
he
got
to
the
top
of
the
hill
at
last
and
began
to
drop
down
there
was
nothing
but
a
wandering
here
and
there
and
the
mountain
was
by
no
means
as
easy
to
descend
as
the
classic
avernus
so
that
when
he
got
to
the
bottom
and
came
in
sight
of
the
little
inn
nestling
in
a
crook
of
the
valley
he
was
both
tired
and
hungry
howard
beautiful
in
came
sauntering
to
the
door
with
his
long
white
hands
in
his
pocket
and
a
plaintive
reproach
on
his
vandyke
face
i
was
just
about
to
send
off
the
search
party
my
dear
stafford
he
said
is
it
possible
that
you
have
just
come
down
that
hill
good
heavens
what
follies
are
committed
in
thy
name
o
sport
and
of
course
there
are
no
fish
there
never
are
the
water
is
always
too
thin
or
too
thick
the
sky
too
bright
or
too
dull
the
wind
too
high
or
too
low
excuses
are
the
badge
of
all
the
angling
tribe
stafford
took
his
basket
from
his
shoulder
and
made
a
pretence
of
slinging
it
at
howard
head
then
tossed
it
to
the
landlord
who
stood
by
smiling
obsequiously
cook
some
of
as
soon
as
you
can
he
said
then
he
followed
the
neat
and
also
smiling
up
to
his
room
where
for
all
his
pretended
indolence
and
cynicism
howard
had
caused
his
friend
things
to
be
laid
out
in
readiness
for
him
stafford
dressed
slowly
smoking
a
cigarette
during
the
operation
and
still
thinking
of
the
strange
farmer
daughter
and
then
he
went
down
and
joined
howard
in
the
room
he
had
ordered
lake
hotels
may
lack
the
splendour
to
which
we
are
all
growing
accustomed
and
of
which
alas
we
are
also
growing
rather
wearied
but
they
are
most
of
them
extremely
comfortable
and
cosy
and
the
woodman
at
carysford
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
stafford
looked
round
the
room
with
its
furniture
its
white
gleaming
softly
in
the
sunset
and
the
and
sighed
with
a
nod
of
satisfaction
this
is
something
like
eh
old
man
he
said
and
even
howard
deigned
to
nod
approvingly
yes
he
said
if
anything
could
compensate
one
for
the
miseries
of
travel
especially
that
awful
drive
this
should
do
so
i
confess
i
had
looked
forward
to
a
crowning
discomfort
in
the
shape
of
a
cold
and
draughty
and
smelly
room
fried
chops
or
a
gory
leg
of
mutton
and
a
heel
of
the
cheese
made
by
noah
in
the
ark
i
fancy
that
we
are
going
to
have
a
decent
dinner
and
i
trust
i
may
not
be
disappointed
for
it
is
about
the
only
thing
that
will
save
my
life
are
you
dry
yet
you
looked
as
if
you
had
been
walking
through
a
river
instead
of
beside
it
that
just
what
i
have
been
doing
said
stafford
with
a
laugh
i
had
an
adventure
i
know
interrupted
howard
with
a
sigh
you
are
going
to
tell
me
how
you
hooked
a
trout
six
foot
in
length
how
it
dragged
you
a
mile
and
a
half
up
the
river
how
you
got
it
up
to
the
bank
and
how
just
as
you
were
landing
it
it
broke
away
and
was
lost
every
man
who
has
been
fishing
has
that
adventure
stafford
laughed
with
his
usual
appreciation
of
his
friend
amusing
cynicism
but
he
did
not
correct
him
for
at
that
moment
the
neat
brought
in
the
trout
which
proved
to
be
piping
hot
and
of
a
and
the
two
men
commenced
a
dinner
which
as
compared
with
the
famous
or
infamous
one
of
the
london
restaurant
was
olympian
the
landlord
himself
brought
in
a
bottle
of
claret
which
actually
was
sound
and
another
of
port
in
a
wicker
cradle
which
even
howard
deigned
to
approve
of
and
the
two
men
after
they
had
lingered
over
their
dinner
got
into
beside
the
fire
and
smoked
their
cigars
with
that
sweet
contentment
which
only
tobacco
can
produce
and
only
then
when
it
follows
a
really
good
meal
do
you
know
how
long
you
are
going
to
stay
in
your
father
little
place
howard
asked
after
a
long
and
dreary
silence
stafford
shrugged
his
shoulders
slightly
my
word
i
do
know
he
answered
i
like
the
do
know
nothink
i
suppose
i
shall
stay
as
long
as
the
governor
does
and
come
to
that
i
suppose
he
does
know
how
long
that
will
be
i
got
to
regard
him
as
a
kind
of
stormy
petrel
here
and
gone
always
on
the
wing
and
never
resting
anywhere
for
any
time
i
never
surprised
when
i
hear
that
though
his
last
letter
was
dated
africa
he
has
flown
back
to
europe
or
has
run
over
to
australia
said
howard
musingly
there
is
an
atmosphere
of
mystery
and
romance
about
your
esteemed
parent
sir
stephen
orme
which
smacks
of
the
arabian
nights
my
dear
stafford
man
of
the
world
as
i
am
i
must
confess
that
i
regard
him
with
a
kind
of
wondering
awe
and
that
i
follow
his
erratic
movements
very
much
as
one
would
follow
the
celestial
progress
of
a
particularly
splendacious
comet
he
never
ceases
to
be
an
object
of
wonderment
to
me
and
i
love
to
read
of
his
gigantic
projects
his
vast
wealth
his
brilliant
successes
and
i
tell
you
frankly
that
i
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
him
with
a
mixture
of
fear
and
curiosity
do
not
be
surprised
if
at
my
introduction
i
fall
on
my
hands
and
knees
in
oriental
abasement
i
have
admired
him
so
much
and
so
long
at
a
distance
that
he
has
assumed
in
my
eyes
an
almost
regal
not
to
say
imperial
importance
i
hope
you
will
like
him
said
stafford
with
a
touch
of
that
simplicity
which
all
his
friends
liked
if
he
resembles
his
son
i
am
sure
to
do
so
said
howard
indeed
in
any
case
i
am
pretty
sure
to
do
so
for
how
often
have
i
read
of
his
wonderful
charm
of
manner
his
winning
smile
and
brilliant
conversational
powers
when
do
we
get
to
this
fairy
palace
i
suppose
if
we
get
there
before
dinner
it
will
be
time
enough
replied
stafford
by
the
way
i
better
ask
how
far
it
is
ring
i
want
to
go
up
for
some
more
cigars
he
went
up
to
his
room
and
in
getting
them
from
his
bag
saw
the
little
instrument
case
which
he
had
thrown
into
his
bag
when
he
was
changing
back
came
the
vision
of
the
strange
girl
with
the
beautiful
face
he
slipped
the
wallet
in
his
pocket
and
when
he
reached
the
hall
he
turned
to
the
open
door
of
the
little
room
which
served
as
the
landlord
office
or
the
landlord
was
enjoying
a
cigar
and
a
glass
of
whiskey
and
water
and
he
opened
the
door
still
wider
and
gave
a
respectful
smile
of
welcome
you
have
a
very
comfortable
hotel
here
groves
said
stafford
by
way
of
opening
the
conversation
we
have
had
a
capital
dinner
and
have
enjoyed
it
tremendously
was
that
port
you
gave
us
yes
sir
replied
groves
much
gratified
for
you
go
straight
to
a
landlord
heart
when
you
guess
a
good
vintage
and
appreciate
it
i
am
glad
you
like
it
sir
there
more
of
it
at
your
service
will
you
take
a
seat
sir
and
may
i
offer
you
a
glass
of
whiskey
it
is
as
good
as
the
port
if
i
may
say
so
stafford
accepted
and
presented
his
cigar
case
he
asked
the
distance
to
the
new
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
and
having
been
informed
spoke
of
the
fishing
you
did
very
well
sir
said
groves
you
were
fishing
in
the
heron
water
i
suppose
this
was
what
stafford
wanted
yes
he
said
i
was
poaching
i
mistook
it
for
the
lesset
water
i
must
go
over
and
apologise
to
heron
by
the
way
i
was
told
i
was
poaching
by
a
young
lady
who
rode
down
to
the
stream
while
i
was
fishing
i
had
some
little
conversation
with
her
but
i
did
not
learn
her
name
she
was
a
young
lady
with
dark
hair
rode
a
big
horse
and
had
a
couple
of
dogs
with
her
a
collie
and
a
the
landlord
had
nodded
assentingly
at
each
item
of
the
description
that
must
have
been
miss
ida
miss
heron
the
squire
daughter
sir
he
said
stafford
brows
went
up
no
wonder
she
stared
at
me
he
said
almost
to
himself
but
are
you
sure
the
young
lady
i
saw
was
not
dressed
well
like
a
daughter
and
she
was
looking
after
some
sheep
like
like
a
girl
the
landlord
nodded
again
that
was
miss
ida
right
enough
sir
he
said
with
a
touch
of
respect
and
something
like
pride
in
his
tone
indeed
it
could
be
anyone
else
no
doubt
miss
ida
had
come
down
to
look
after
the
sheep
in
the
valley
and
there
no
farmer
daughter
in
the
vale
that
could
do
it
better
or
half
so
well
as
she
there
is
a
girl
in
the
county
or
for
that
matter
a
man
either
who
can
ride
like
miss
ida
or
knows
more
about
the
points
of
a
horse
or
a
dog
yes
and
you
may
say
a
cow
than
the
squire
daughter
and
as
to
her
being
poorly
dressed
well
there
a
reason
for
that
sir
the
family
poor
very
poor
yet
the
dale
seems
to
be
called
after
them
stafford
remarked
it
is
sir
assented
the
landlord
at
one
time
they
owned
more
land
than
any
other
of
the
big
families
here
miles
and
miles
of
it
with
some
of
the
best
farms
but
that
was
before
my
time
though
i
heard
my
father
tell
of
it
there
not
very
much
left
now
beyond
the
dale
and
the
home
meadows
he
sighed
as
he
spoke
and
looked
sadly
at
the
costly
cigar
which
he
was
smoking
the
feudal
spirit
still
exists
in
the
hearts
of
the
men
who
were
born
in
these
remote
dales
and
towering
hills
and
the
landlord
of
the
little
inn
was
as
proud
of
the
antiquity
of
the
heron
family
and
as
sorry
for
its
broken
fortune
as
any
of
the
middle
ages
could
have
been
for
the
misfortunes
of
his
feudal
baron
heron
hall
used
to
be
a
fine
place
at
one
time
sir
i
can
remember
my
father
describing
what
it
was
in
his
and
his
father
days
how
there
used
to
be
scores
of
servants
and
as
many
as
fifty
horses
in
the
stables
with
the
great
place
filled
with
guests
summer
and
winter
spring
and
autumn
the
squire
heron
of
that
time
never
rode
behind
less
than
four
horses
and
once
when
he
was
high
sheriff
he
rode
to
meet
the
judges
with
six
it
was
open
house
to
every
poor
man
in
the
place
and
no
wanderer
was
ever
turned
from
the
door
the
squire
of
my
father
time
was
the
county
member
and
the
day
he
was
elected
there
were
two
hogsheads
of
port
and
two
of
brandy
broached
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
terrace
and
for
a
week
afterwards
there
was
scarcely
a
sober
man
in
the
town
for
miles
round
he
was
master
of
the
hounds
and
the
hunt
breakfasts
and
the
hunt
balls
were
more
splendid
than
anything
else
of
that
kind
in
the
kingdom
in
fact
people
used
to
come
from
all
parts
of
the
kingdom
to
attend
them
yes
the
herons
made
herondale
famous
as
you
may
say
sir
he
paused
and
shook
his
head
and
stafford
remained
silent
he
was
too
wise
to
break
in
upon
the
narrative
the
landlord
sighed
and
looked
lovingly
at
his
cigar
then
went
on
they
offered
that
squire
miss
ida
grandfather
a
peerage
the
herons
had
often
been
offered
a
baronetcy
but
they
always
refused
and
the
squire
declined
the
peerage
he
said
that
no
man
could
wish
to
be
higher
than
heron
of
herondale
that
better
men
than
he
had
been
contented
with
it
and
he
was
quite
satisfied
with
the
rank
which
had
satisfied
his
forefathers
when
he
died
the
followers
at
the
funeral
made
a
procession
a
mile
and
a
quarter
long
how
did
the
family
lose
its
money
drop
its
greatness
stafford
asked
the
landlord
screwed
up
his
eyes
thoughtfully
well
it
hard
to
tell
sir
he
replied
of
course
there
was
always
a
tremendous
drain
going
on
for
it
was
not
only
down
here
that
the
squire
spent
the
money
freely
but
it
was
just
the
same
or
worse
when
he
was
in
london
he
had
a
big
house
there
and
entertained
as
splendidly
perhaps
more
so
than
he
did
at
the
hall
in
those
days
too
sir
there
was
as
much
gaming
and
betting
as
there
is
now
perhaps
more
though
i
told
that
great
folks
are
more
given
nowadays
to
gambling
on
the
stock
exchange
than
at
cards
or
begging
your
pardon
sir
i
afraid
you
right
assented
stafford
with
his
short
laugh
i
prefer
the
old
way
myself
just
so
sir
said
the
landlord
with
an
approving
nod
well
what
with
the
money
going
here
and
there
and
everywhere
they
found
when
the
present
squire
father
died
that
there
was
very
little
left
and
worse
than
all
that
some
of
the
land
was
sold
and
what
remained
was
heavily
mortgaged
it
what
often
happens
to
old
families
sir
more
the
pity
yes
said
stafford
and
is
the
present
squire
like
his
father
no
sir
not
a
bit
replied
the
landlord
with
a
thoughtful
and
somewhat
puzzled
frown
quite
the
reverse
his
father
was
free
and
easy
with
everybody
and
had
a
pleasant
word
and
shake
of
the
hand
for
everyone
he
met
but
the
present
squire
was
always
shy
and
quiet
as
a
boy
kind
of
reserved
and
if
you
know
what
i
mean
sir
when
he
came
into
the
property
he
became
more
reserved
than
ever
avoided
all
his
father
old
friends
and
shut
himself
up
at
the
hall
and
kept
himself
to
himself
he
was
a
college
gentleman
and
fond
of
books
and
he
spent
all
his
time
alone
in
his
library
like
a
a
hermit
he
went
abroad
for
a
time
to
italy
they
thought
and
he
came
back
with
a
wife
but
she
did
make
things
more
lively
for
she
died
soon
after
miss
ida
was
born
miss
ida
was
the
only
child
she
was
sent
away
for
some
time
to
be
taken
care
of
by
one
of
the
relatives
and
only
been
back
for
a
couple
of
years
poor
girl
said
stafford
involuntarily
well
yes
you
may
say
that
sir
said
the
landlord
but
doubtfully
though
it
do
seem
as
if
miss
ida
was
in
need
of
much
pity
she
is
so
bright
and
and
as
you
may
say
though
it
a
wonder
she
can
be
so
seeing
the
life
she
leads
alone
in
that
great
place
with
her
father
who
never
goes
beyond
the
garden
and
who
shuts
himself
up
with
his
books
all
day
yes
it
a
wonder
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
that
she
can
smile
and
laugh
and
be
as
cheerful
as
she
is
i
often
hear
her
singing
when
she
riding
through
the
dale
or
along
the
road
here
miss
ida
wonderfully
liked
by
all
the
people
sir
in
fact
you
might
say
that
they
worship
her
i
can
understand
it
said
stafford
almost
to
himself
it
must
have
been
great
change
to
her
continued
the
landlord
coming
down
here
from
london
to
such
a
wild
place
many
young
ladies
would
have
lost
heart
and
pined
and
fretted
but
she
a
true
heron
is
miss
ida
and
she
faced
the
thing
fairly
and
buckled
to
as
you
may
say
she
took
the
whole
thing
on
her
shoulders
and
though
she
could
coax
the
squire
out
of
his
shell
she
takes
care
of
him
and
runs
the
whole
place
as
if
she
were
a
man
yes
sir
though
she
only
a
girl
as
you
saw
yourself
she
manages
the
house
and
the
farm
as
if
she
were
a
woman
of
forty
it
wonderful
how
picked
it
up
i
honestly
believe
there
is
a
man
in
the
place
as
knows
more
about
horses
as
i
said
than
she
does
but
that
in
the
blood
sir
and
she
can
ride
well
you
saw
for
yourself
and
has
she
no
society
no
amusements
does
she
go
out
have
friends
i
mean
the
landlord
shook
his
head
no
sir
she
just
lives
there
with
the
squire
and
they
see
no
one
receive
no
visits
and
pay
none
you
see
sir
the
herons
are
proud
they
got
cause
to
be
and
i
heard
it
told
that
the
squire
is
too
proud
to
let
the
old
family
friends
see
the
poverty
of
the
house
and
that
he
hates
the
new
people
who
bought
land
and
built
houses
in
the
place
i
sure
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
was
forgetting
for
the
moment
that
your
father
sir
stephen
had
just
built
that
beautiful
place
the
other
side
of
the
lake
stafford
smiled
that
all
right
groves
he
said
i
can
quite
understand
heron
thinking
it
confounded
cheek
of
a
stranger
to
come
here
and
stick
up
a
great
white
place
which
no
one
can
fail
to
see
five
miles
off
i
suppose
you
think
if
i
were
to
present
myself
at
the
hall
i
should
get
a
very
cold
reception
eh
i
afraid
you
would
get
any
reception
at
all
sir
replied
groves
with
respectful
candour
i
am
afraid
neither
heron
nor
miss
ida
would
see
you
the
old
butler
would
just
say
at
home
as
he
says
to
the
county
people
when
they
try
and
call
there
especially
if
they
knew
who
you
were
sir
if
i
remember
rightly
the
part
of
the
land
sir
stephen
bought
belonged
to
the
herons
i
see
said
stafford
it
strikes
me
it
is
rather
a
sad
story
groves
it
a
case
of
the
children
paying
for
the
sins
of
their
fathers
that
it
sir
assented
the
landlord
it
takes
ages
to
build
up
a
house
and
a
family
like
the
herons
but
one
man
can
knock
it
down
so
to
speak
it
hard
lines
for
miss
ida
who
is
as
as
any
of
the
titled
people
in
the
county
and
far
better
than
most
they
say
that
she
been
wonderful
well
educated
too
though
of
course
she
has
seen
anything
of
the
world
having
come
straight
from
some
small
place
in
foreign
parts
to
be
shut
up
in
the
dale
and
it
quite
out
of
the
world
here
sir
especially
in
the
winter
when
the
snow
lies
so
thick
that
we
almost
imprisoned
but
wet
or
fine
hot
or
cold
miss
ida
can
always
be
seen
riding
or
driving
or
walking
she
a
regular
westmoreland
lass
for
that
no
weather
frights
her
at
this
juncture
howard
sauntered
out
of
the
and
he
and
stafford
went
to
the
open
door
and
looked
out
on
the
exquisite
view
which
was
now
bathed
in
the
soft
light
of
a
newly
risen
moon
it
still
has
a
smack
of
drury
lane
has
it
said
howard
strange
that
whenever
we
see
anything
beautiful
in
the
way
of
a
landscape
we
at
once
compare
it
with
a
stage
the
fact
of
it
is
my
dear
stafford
we
have
become
absolutely
artificial
we
pretend
to
admire
nature
but
we
are
thinking
of
a
theatre
all
the
time
we
throw
up
our
eyes
ecstatically
when
we
hear
a
nightingale
but
we
much
prefer
a
comic
singer
at
the
tivoli
we
talk
sentiment
at
feast
some
of
us
but
we
have
ceased
to
feel
it
we
do
really
know
what
it
means
i
believe
some
of
the
minor
poets
still
write
about
what
they
call
love
but
in
my
private
opinion
the
thing
itself
has
become
instinct
who
knows
anything
about
it
take
yourself
for
instance
you
never
been
in
love
you
everything
that
you
can
desire
you
clad
in
purple
and
fine
linen
you
fare
sumptuously
every
day
you
flirt
six
days
in
the
week
and
rest
not
on
the
seventh
but
love
you
do
know
what
it
means
and
if
you
do
you
far
too
wise
in
your
generation
to
go
in
for
such
an
uncomfortable
emotion
stafford
smiled
rather
absently
he
was
scarcely
listening
he
was
so
accustomed
to
howard
cynical
diatribes
that
more
often
than
not
they
made
no
more
impression
on
him
than
water
on
a
duck
back
besides
he
was
thinking
of
ida
heron
the
girl
whose
strange
history
he
had
just
been
listening
to
there
was
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
and
while
they
stood
leaning
against
the
two
men
came
out
of
another
door
in
the
inn
and
stood
talking
they
were
commercial
travellers
and
they
were
enjoying
their
pipes
of
extremely
strong
tobacco
after
a
hard
day
work
presently
one
of
them
said
seen
that
place
of
sir
stephen
orme
on
the
hill
splendacious
it
must
have
cost
a
small
fortune
i
wonder
what
the
old
man
game
is
the
other
man
shook
his
head
and
laughed
of
course
he
up
to
some
game
he
would
lay
out
all
that
money
for
nothing
millionaire
as
he
is
he
always
got
something
up
his
sleeve
perhaps
he
going
to
entertain
some
big
swell
he
wants
to
get
into
his
net
or
some
of
the
foreign
princes
he
with
you
never
know
what
sir
stephen
orme
up
to
perhaps
he
going
to
stand
for
the
county
if
so
he
bound
to
get
in
he
always
succeeds
or
if
he
do
you
do
hear
of
his
failures
he
the
sort
of
man
disraeli
used
to
write
about
in
his
novels
one
of
the
chaps
who
go
through
fire
and
water
to
get
their
ends
yes
and
blood
too
if
necessary
there
been
some
queer
stories
told
about
him
they
say
he
sticks
at
nothing
look
at
that
last
turkish
concession
the
speaker
and
his
companion
sauntered
down
the
road
stafford
and
howard
had
heard
every
word
but
stafford
looked
straight
before
him
and
made
no
sign
and
howard
yawned
as
if
he
had
not
heard
a
syllable
do
you
raise
any
objection
to
my
going
to
my
little
bed
stafford
he
asked
i
suppose
having
done
nothing
more
than
clamber
about
a
river
get
wet
through
and
tramp
a
dozen
miles
over
hills
you
do
not
feel
tired
no
said
stafford
i
do
feel
like
turning
in
just
yet
old
man
when
howard
had
gone
stafford
exchanged
his
for
a
and
with
the
little
wallet
in
his
pocket
and
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
he
strode
up
the
road
as
he
said
he
did
not
feel
tired
it
was
difficult
for
stafford
with
his
athletic
frame
and
perfect
muscular
system
to
get
tired
under
any
circumstances
the
night
was
one
of
the
loveliest
he
had
ever
seen
and
it
seemed
wicked
to
waste
it
by
going
to
bed
so
he
walked
on
all
unconsciously
going
in
the
direction
of
heron
hall
the
remarks
about
his
father
which
had
fallen
from
the
bagman
stuck
to
him
for
a
time
like
a
burr
it
pleasant
to
hear
your
father
described
as
a
kind
of
charlatan
and
trickster
and
stafford
would
have
liked
to
have
collared
the
man
and
knocked
an
apology
out
of
him
but
there
are
certain
disadvantages
attached
to
the
position
of
gentlemen
and
one
of
them
is
that
you
have
to
pretend
to
be
deaf
to
speeches
that
were
not
intended
for
your
ears
so
stafford
could
not
bash
the
bagman
for
having
spoken
disrespectfully
of
the
great
sir
stephen
orme
but
presently
almost
suddenly
stafford
came
in
sight
of
the
magnificent
iron
gates
and
he
forgot
his
father
and
the
talkative
commercial
traveller
and
his
interest
in
the
girl
of
the
dale
flashed
back
upon
him
with
full
force
he
saw
that
the
gates
were
chained
and
locked
and
with
a
natural
curiosity
he
followed
the
road
beside
the
wall
it
stopped
almost
abruptly
and
gave
place
to
a
low
railing
which
divided
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
from
the
park
beyond
and
the
long
irregular
facade
of
the
old
building
was
suddenly
revealed
chapter
iii
stafford
looked
at
it
with
admiration
mingled
with
pity
in
the
light
of
the
story
the
landlord
had
told
him
he
realised
the
full
pathos
of
its
antique
grandeur
it
was
not
a
ruin
by
any
means
but
it
was
grim
with
the
air
of
neglect
of
desolation
of
solitude
in
two
only
of
the
many
windows
was
there
any
light
there
was
no
sound
of
life
about
the
vast
place
and
the
moonlight
showed
up
with
cruel
distinctness
the
ravages
made
in
and
by
the
clawlike
hand
of
time
a
capital
of
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
still
handsome
portico
had
crumbled
several
of
the
pillars
were
broken
and
askew
the
great
door
was
blistered
and
cracked
by
the
sun
evidently
no
paint
had
touched
the
place
for
years
the
stone
balustrade
of
the
broad
terrace
had
several
gaps
in
it
and
the
coping
and
the
pillars
were
lying
where
they
had
fallen
the
steps
of
the
terrace
had
grass
growing
in
the
interstices
of
the
stones
one
of
the
lions
which
had
flanked
the
steps
had
disappeared
and
the
remaining
one
was
short
of
a
front
leg
the
grass
on
the
lawn
was
long
and
unkempt
the
flower
beds
weedy
and
straggly
and
the
flowers
themselves
growing
wild
and
untrained
but
for
the
smoke
which
ascended
from
two
or
three
of
the
many
chimneys
the
place
might
well
have
seemed
deserted
and
uninhabited
and
stafford
with
this
feeling
upon
him
stood
and
gazed
at
the
place
unrestrainedly
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
realise
that
only
a
few
hours
ago
he
had
left
london
that
only
last
night
he
had
dined
at
his
club
and
gone
to
the
big
merrivale
dance
it
was
as
if
he
were
standing
in
some
scene
of
the
middle
ages
he
would
not
have
been
greatly
surprised
if
the
terrace
had
suddenly
become
crowded
by
forms
in
patches
and
powder
hoops
and
ruffles
good
lord
what
would
some
of
the
people
i
know
give
to
belong
to
to
own
this
place
he
said
to
himself
to
think
of
that
girl
living
alone
here
with
her
father
he
was
turning
away
when
he
heard
a
slight
sound
the
great
door
opened
slowly
and
that
girl
came
out
on
to
the
terrace
she
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
great
marble
door
sill
then
she
crossed
the
terrace
and
leaning
on
the
balustrade
looked
dreamily
at
the
moonlit
view
which
lay
before
her
she
could
not
see
stafford
tall
figure
which
was
concealed
by
the
shadow
of
one
of
the
trees
and
she
thought
herself
alone
as
usual
her
solitude
did
not
sadden
her
she
was
accustomed
to
it
and
presently
as
if
moved
by
the
exquisite
beauty
of
the
night
her
lips
parted
and
she
half
sang
half
hummed
the
jewel
song
from
faust
she
had
looked
beautiful
enough
in
her
old
and
hat
but
she
seemed
a
vision
of
loveliness
as
she
stood
in
the
moonlight
with
the
old
house
for
a
background
there
was
something
bewitchingly
virginal
in
the
rapt
and
dreamy
face
with
its
dark
eyes
and
long
lashes
in
the
soft
delicately
cut
lips
the
pure
ivory
pallor
at
the
same
time
something
equally
bewitching
in
the
modernness
of
her
dress
which
was
of
soft
cream
cashmere
made
rather
long
and
in
accord
with
the
present
fashion
she
had
placed
a
rose
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
and
it
stood
out
redly
richly
from
the
soft
cream
her
hair
was
no
longer
rough
and
touzled
by
the
wind
but
brushed
in
rippling
smoothness
and
coiled
in
dainty
neatness
in
the
nape
of
her
graceful
neck
no
wonder
stafford
caught
his
breath
held
it
as
it
were
as
he
gazed
at
the
exquisite
picture
which
formed
so
striking
a
contrast
to
her
surroundings
she
leant
her
chin
on
her
hand
and
looked
before
her
as
she
sung
softly
and
at
that
moment
her
thoughts
strayed
from
the
question
of
what
she
should
do
to
keep
the
cows
from
the
lawn
to
the
young
man
who
had
rescued
her
lamb
for
her
she
did
not
think
of
him
with
anything
like
interest
or
curiosity
but
she
was
recalling
the
ludicrous
picture
he
made
as
he
struggled
to
the
bank
with
the
lamb
in
his
arms
and
a
faint
smile
crossed
her
face
at
this
moment
donald
and
bess
strolled
out
to
join
her
they
would
much
have
preferred
to
have
remained
roasting
themselves
in
front
of
the
hall
fire
but
ridiculous
as
it
was
for
their
mistress
to
leave
the
warm
house
for
the
comparatively
cold
terrace
they
felt
themselves
in
duty
bound
to
join
her
perhaps
they
might
catch
sight
of
a
rabbit
to
repay
them
for
their
exertions
donald
walked
with
stately
steps
toward
his
mistress
and
bess
was
following
with
a
shiver
of
reluctance
and
a
backward
glance
towards
the
which
shone
through
the
open
door
when
suddenly
she
sniffed
the
presence
of
a
stranger
and
with
a
sharp
yap
hurled
herself
down
the
broad
steps
and
towards
the
spot
where
stafford
still
stood
donald
with
a
loud
bay
followed
with
his
long
stride
and
ida
startled
from
her
reverie
followed
as
far
as
the
top
of
the
steps
and
waited
i
might
have
expected
the
faithful
said
stafford
to
himself
now
what
on
earth
am
i
to
do
i
suppose
they
spring
on
me
the
collie
at
any
rate
it
no
use
running
i
got
to
stop
and
face
it
what
a
confounded
nuisance
but
it
serves
me
right
i
no
business
to
be
loafing
about
the
place
as
the
dogs
came
up
he
put
on
that
air
of
conciliation
which
we
all
know
and
murmuring
good
dog
all
right
old
chap
tried
to
pacify
donald
and
bess
but
they
were
not
accustomed
to
intruders
especially
at
that
time
of
night
and
they
were
legitimately
furious
dancing
round
him
and
displaying
dazzling
teeth
threateningly
they
drew
nearer
and
nearer
and
they
would
certainly
have
sprung
upon
him
but
the
girl
came
not
running
but
quickly
down
the
steps
and
straight
across
the
dewy
grass
towards
them
calling
to
the
dogs
as
she
came
in
her
clear
low
voice
which
had
not
a
trace
of
fear
in
it
their
loud
barking
changed
to
sullen
growls
as
she
approached
and
motioning
them
to
be
still
she
stopped
and
gazed
at
stafford
who
stepped
out
into
the
moonlight
she
said
not
a
word
but
as
she
recognised
him
a
faint
colour
came
into
the
ivory
pallor
of
her
cheek
and
an
expression
of
surprise
in
the
dark
fearless
eyes
stafford
raised
his
cap
i
am
very
sorry
he
said
i
am
afraid
you
must
think
me
a
great
nuisance
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
been
guilty
of
trespass
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
not
with
shyness
but
as
if
she
were
noticing
the
change
in
his
dress
and
wondering
how
he
came
to
be
in
and
where
he
had
come
from
the
expression
was
one
of
simple
girlish
curiosity
which
softened
in
a
delicious
way
the
general
pride
and
hauteur
of
her
face
you
are
not
trespassing
she
said
and
the
voice
sounded
very
sweet
and
musical
after
the
din
of
the
dogs
there
is
public
right
of
way
along
this
road
i
am
immensely
relieved
said
stafford
it
looks
so
unfrequented
that
i
was
afraid
it
was
private
and
that
i
had
made
another
blunder
all
the
same
i
am
very
sorry
that
i
should
have
disturbed
you
and
made
the
dogs
kick
up
such
a
row
i
would
have
gone
on
or
gone
back
if
i
had
known
you
were
coming
out
but
the
place
looked
so
quiet
it
does
not
matter
she
said
they
bark
at
the
slightest
noise
and
we
are
used
to
it
the
place
is
so
quiet
because
only
my
father
and
i
live
here
and
there
are
only
a
few
servants
and
the
place
is
so
big
all
this
was
said
not
repiningly
but
softly
and
a
little
dreamily
by
this
time
donald
and
bess
had
recovered
their
tempers
and
after
a
close
inspection
of
the
intruder
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
of
the
right
sort
and
donald
was
sitting
close
on
his
launches
beside
stafford
and
thrusting
his
nose
against
stafford
hand
invitingly
the
girl
beauty
seemed
to
stafford
almost
bewildering
and
yet
softly
and
sweetly
a
part
of
the
beauty
of
the
night
he
was
conscious
of
a
fear
that
was
actually
a
dread
that
she
would
bow
call
the
dogs
and
leave
him
so
before
she
could
do
so
he
made
haste
to
say
now
i
am
here
will
you
allow
me
to
apologise
for
my
trespass
of
this
afternoon
she
inclined
her
head
slightly
it
does
not
matter
she
said
you
were
very
kind
in
helping
me
with
the
lamb
and
i
ought
to
have
told
you
that
my
father
would
be
very
glad
if
you
would
fish
in
the
heron
you
will
find
some
better
trout
higher
up
the
valley
thank
you
very
much
said
stafford
calling
the
dogs
she
turned
away
then
fortunately
stafford
remembered
the
case
of
instruments
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
i
forgot
this
wallet
i
found
it
by
the
stream
after
you
had
gone
oh
my
wallet
she
cried
i
am
so
glad
you
have
found
it
i
know
what
i
should
have
done
if
you
had
not
i
should
have
had
to
send
to
preston
or
to
london
and
besides
it
was
a
present
from
the
old
veterinary
surgeon
he
left
it
to
me
there
were
some
beautiful
instruments
in
it
still
smiling
she
opened
it
as
if
to
show
him
stafford
drew
near
so
near
as
to
become
conscious
of
the
perfume
of
the
rose
in
her
bosom
of
the
still
fainter
but
more
exquisite
perfume
of
her
hair
he
bent
over
the
case
in
silence
and
while
they
were
looking
a
cloud
sailed
across
the
moon
the
sudden
disappearance
of
the
light
roused
her
as
it
were
to
a
sense
of
his
presence
thank
you
for
bringing
it
to
me
she
said
it
was
very
good
of
you
oh
i
had
to
bring
it
far
said
stafford
i
am
staying
at
the
woodman
inn
at
carysford
oh
she
said
you
are
a
tourist
you
are
fishing
stafford
could
not
bring
himself
to
say
that
he
was
the
son
of
the
man
who
had
built
the
great
white
house
which
no
doubt
her
father
and
she
resented
you
have
a
very
beautiful
place
here
he
said
after
a
pause
she
turned
and
looked
at
the
house
in
the
dim
light
with
a
touch
of
pride
in
her
dreamy
eyes
yes
she
said
as
if
it
were
useless
to
deny
the
fact
it
is
very
old
and
i
am
very
fond
she
stopped
suddenly
her
lips
apart
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
farther
end
of
the
terrace
for
while
she
had
been
speaking
a
figure
only
just
perceptible
in
the
had
moved
slowly
across
the
end
of
the
terrace
paused
for
a
moment
at
the
head
of
the
flight
of
steps
and
then
slowly
descended
stafford
also
saw
it
and
glancing
at
her
he
saw
that
she
was
startled
if
not
frightened
she
scarcely
seemed
to
breathe
and
she
turned
her
large
dark
eyes
upon
him
questioningly
somewhat
appealingly
what
is
that
she
said
in
a
whisper
more
to
herself
than
to
him
someone
a
man
has
gone
down
the
steps
from
the
house
he
said
do
you
know
who
it
is
no
she
replied
in
as
low
a
voice
it
is
not
jason
there
is
no
one
else
who
can
it
be
i
will
go
and
see
she
moved
towards
the
terrace
and
stafford
said
i
will
come
with
you
you
will
let
me
she
did
not
refuse
indeed
she
appeared
to
have
forgotten
his
presence
together
they
crossed
the
lawn
and
reached
the
corner
of
the
house
near
which
the
figure
had
disappeared
it
struck
stafford
as
strange
that
the
dogs
did
not
bark
in
profound
silence
they
went
in
the
direction
the
figure
had
taken
and
stafford
presently
saw
a
ruined
building
which
had
evidently
been
a
chapel
as
they
approached
it
the
figure
came
out
of
it
and
towards
them
as
it
passed
them
so
close
that
they
instinctively
drew
back
stafford
saw
that
it
was
an
old
man
in
a
his
head
was
bare
his
hair
touched
the
collar
of
the
gown
his
eyes
were
wide
open
and
gazing
straight
in
front
of
him
stafford
was
about
to
step
forward
and
arrest
his
progress
when
suddenly
the
girl
hand
seized
his
and
gripped
it
hush
she
whispered
with
subdued
terror
it
is
my
father
he
yes
he
is
asleep
oh
see
he
is
asleep
he
will
fall
hurt
himself
she
in
her
turn
was
about
to
spring
forward
but
stafford
caught
her
arm
no
no
you
must
not
he
said
in
a
hurried
whisper
i
think
it
would
be
dangerous
i
think
he
is
all
right
if
you
let
him
alone
he
is
walking
in
his
sleep
do
speak
do
cry
out
no
no
she
breathed
but
it
is
dreadful
instinctively
unconsciously
she
drew
closer
to
stafford
almost
clung
to
him
watching
her
father
over
her
shoulder
until
the
figure
with
its
ghastly
mechanical
movement
and
vacant
stare
had
passed
into
the
house
then
with
a
long
breath
and
with
her
hands
clasping
her
throat
as
if
she
were
stifling
she
broke
from
stafford
and
sprang
quickly
and
noiselessly
up
the
steps
and
disappeared
also
wondering
whether
he
was
awake
or
dreaming
stafford
waited
for
over
an
hour
to
see
if
she
would
appear
again
and
he
was
turning
away
at
last
when
her
figure
appeared
in
the
open
like
that
of
a
wraith
she
waved
her
hand
to
him
then
disappeared
and
the
door
closed
still
asking
himself
if
he
were
not
in
a
land
of
dreams
but
tingling
with
the
touch
of
her
small
hand
with
the
haunting
perfume
of
the
soft
black
hair
stafford
gained
the
road
and
walked
towards
the
inn
chapter
iv
ida
had
followed
her
father
across
the
terrace
across
the
hall
lit
weirdly
by
the
glow
of
the
sinking
fire
and
the
pale
moonlight
up
the
broad
stairs
along
the
corridor
to
the
open
door
of
his
room
he
had
walked
slowly
but
steadily
with
his
usual
gait
and
his
head
bent
slightly
though
his
eyes
were
wide
open
he
seemed
to
see
nothing
yet
he
did
not
stumble
or
even
hesitate
ida
followed
behind
him
with
absolute
noiselessness
they
were
both
ghostlike
in
their
movements
and
the
dogs
stood
and
watched
them
intently
ears
erect
and
with
that
gravity
in
their
eyes
which
dogs
wear
when
they
are
puzzled
the
old
man
closed
his
door
softly
still
without
any
hesitation
and
ida
grasping
the
broad
rail
of
the
staircase
waited
breathlessly
she
heard
him
moving
about
as
leisurely
and
precisely
as
before
then
all
was
still
she
stole
to
the
door
and
opened
it
the
light
was
streaming
into
the
room
and
fell
athwart
the
bed
in
which
he
was
lying
his
eyes
closed
his
face
calm
and
peaceful
she
went
on
tiptoe
to
the
bed
and
bent
over
him
and
found
that
he
was
in
a
deep
profound
sleep
with
a
long
breath
of
relief
she
left
him
and
sat
on
the
stairs
and
waited
for
it
was
just
possible
that
he
might
rise
again
and
resume
the
dreadful
walk
that
motion
of
death
in
life
she
waited
for
an
hour
so
absorbed
in
her
anxiety
that
she
did
not
remember
the
man
she
had
left
outside
after
another
quarter
of
an
hour
she
went
to
her
father
room
and
found
that
he
was
still
sleeping
then
she
remembered
stafford
remembered
him
with
a
start
of
discomfort
and
embarrassment
was
he
waiting
there
still
she
went
and
from
the
open
she
saw
dimly
his
figure
under
the
trees
there
was
something
in
the
attitude
of
the
erect
figure
that
reminded
her
of
a
soldier
on
guard
a
sentinel
standing
faithful
at
his
post
and
when
she
had
waved
her
hand
in
dismissal
she
did
not
quite
close
the
door
but
watched
him
through
the
narrow
opening
as
he
paced
slowly
down
the
road
looking
back
at
the
house
now
and
again
as
if
to
see
if
she
wanted
him
then
she
closed
the
door
signed
to
the
dogs
to
be
down
before
the
fire
and
went
up
to
her
room
after
pausing
beside
her
father
door
and
listening
to
his
regular
breathing
her
room
was
a
large
one
nearly
all
the
rooms
in
the
place
were
large
and
as
she
undressed
herself
slowly
she
looked
round
it
with
a
novel
sense
of
loneliness
the
tall
shadows
of
her
graceful
yet
girlish
figure
were
cast
grotesquely
on
the
wall
by
the
candles
beside
her
glass
she
had
never
felt
lonely
before
though
her
life
ever
since
she
had
arrived
at
the
hall
might
be
called
one
almost
of
solitude
she
had
been
so
absorbed
in
the
duties
which
had
so
suddenly
fallen
upon
her
young
shoulders
that
there
had
been
no
time
in
which
to
feel
the
want
of
companionship
there
had
always
been
something
to
think
of
something
to
do
her
father
demanded
so
much
attention
the
house
the
land
the
farm
she
had
to
look
after
them
all
there
had
not
been
time
to
think
even
of
herself
and
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
she
was
leading
a
life
so
different
to
that
led
by
most
girls
but
the
silence
of
the
great
house
large
enough
to
hold
fifty
people
but
sheltering
only
five
persons
her
father
and
herself
and
the
three
servants
weighed
upon
her
that
sense
of
loneliness
had
come
upon
her
suddenly
as
she
had
watched
the
young
man
retreating
figure
she
could
not
help
thinking
of
him
even
when
her
mind
was
oppressed
with
anxiety
on
her
father
account
in
a
vague
way
she
remembered
how
kind
this
stranger
had
been
how
quietly
and
with
what
an
air
of
protection
he
had
stood
by
her
and
restrained
her
from
crying
out
and
alarming
her
father
as
vaguely
she
remembered
that
in
the
moment
of
her
terror
she
had
clung
to
him
had
forgotten
under
the
great
strain
that
he
was
a
stranger
and
a
man
even
now
she
did
not
know
his
name
knew
nothing
of
him
except
that
he
was
staying
at
the
woodman
inn
kind
and
considerate
as
he
had
been
she
thought
of
him
with
something
like
resentment
it
was
as
if
he
had
stepped
into
her
life
had
intruded
upon
its
quiet
uneventfulness
he
had
no
right
to
be
there
no
right
to
have
seen
her
father
in
that
terrible
condition
that
death
in
life
and
she
had
behaved
like
a
frightened
had
not
only
clung
to
him
had
she
clung
to
him
or
was
it
only
fancy
but
had
left
him
without
a
word
of
thanks
had
allowed
him
to
wait
there
and
then
had
waved
her
hand
to
him
just
as
she
had
seen
jessie
the
maid
wave
her
hand
to
her
young
man
after
they
had
parted
and
she
was
going
into
the
house
she
bit
her
lip
softly
and
a
faint
flush
rose
to
the
clear
pallor
of
the
lovely
girlish
face
reflected
in
the
glass
yes
she
had
behaved
just
like
a
she
who
in
her
heart
of
hearts
knew
that
she
prided
herself
upon
her
dignity
and
the
good
manners
which
should
belong
to
a
heron
of
herondale
it
was
characteristic
of
her
that
while
she
thought
of
his
conduct
and
what
she
considered
her
bad
behaviour
she
gave
no
thought
to
the
fact
that
the
stranger
who
had
so
intruded
was
singularly
handsome
and
possessed
of
that
strange
quality
which
at
once
impresses
women
most
girls
would
have
remembered
the
fact
but
ida
was
different
to
the
general
run
of
her
sex
she
had
been
brought
up
in
an
place
in
which
the
modern
novel
the
fashionable
pastime
of
flirtation
were
not
known
and
her
secluded
life
in
the
lonely
dale
had
deepened
that
sense
of
aloofness
from
the
world
that
indifference
to
the
sentiment
which
lurks
in
most
bosoms
this
tall
handsome
man
who
had
stepped
into
her
life
and
shared
the
secret
of
her
father
strange
affliction
weakness
was
nothing
more
to
her
than
one
of
the
other
tourists
whom
she
sometimes
chanced
to
see
on
her
lonely
rides
and
walks
when
she
had
undressed
she
went
again
to
her
father
door
and
listened
to
his
deep
and
regular
breathing
then
at
last
she
went
to
bed
but
the
sense
of
loneliness
was
so
intense
that
she
lay
awake
for
hours
thinking
of
that
bent
figure
walking
in
its
sleep
from
the
shadows
of
the
ruined
chapel
for
the
future
she
would
have
to
watch
her
father
closely
would
perhaps
have
to
lock
the
door
of
his
room
why
had
he
gone
to
the
chapel
so
far
as
she
knew
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
going
there
indeed
she
did
not
remember
having
seen
him
go
there
in
his
waking
moments
she
knew
nothing
of
somnambulism
but
she
imagined
that
he
had
gone
in
that
direction
by
mere
chance
that
if
he
had
happened
to
find
any
impediment
in
his
way
he
might
as
easily
have
gone
in
another
direction
she
fell
asleep
at
last
and
slept
an
hour
beyond
her
usual
time
and
so
deeply
that
jessie
had
filled
the
cold
bath
without
waking
her
beloved
young
mistress
ida
dressed
quickly
all
the
incidents
of
the
preceding
night
rushing
through
her
mind
and
hurried
to
her
father
room
the
door
was
open
the
room
empty
and
with
a
sudden
fear
she
ran
down
the
stairs
and
found
him
in
his
usual
seat
in
the
library
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
went
and
kissed
him
wishing
him
as
casually
as
she
could
you
are
up
early
this
morning
father
she
said
trying
to
keep
her
tone
free
from
any
anxiety
he
glanced
at
the
clock
calmly
no
you
are
later
he
said
his
eyes
met
hers
with
their
usual
expression
of
absentminded
serenity
i
i
was
a
little
tired
and
overslept
myself
she
said
are
are
you
quite
well
this
morning
father
yes
quite
well
why
not
he
replied
with
slight
surprise
she
drew
a
breath
of
relief
it
was
quite
evident
that
he
knew
nothing
of
that
weird
walk
and
that
it
had
not
affected
him
injuriously
nothing
she
said
forcing
a
smile
as
she
spoke
jason
in
his
livery
which
in
some
strange
way
looked
as
if
it
had
shrunken
with
the
figure
which
had
worn
it
so
long
came
to
the
door
and
in
his
husky
voice
said
that
breakfast
was
ready
and
ida
taking
her
father
arm
led
him
into
the
in
which
all
their
meals
were
served
as
she
went
to
her
place
she
glanced
through
the
window
from
which
she
could
see
the
steps
at
the
corner
of
the
terrace
and
a
small
part
of
the
ruined
chapel
and
she
shuddered
when
she
had
poured
out
her
father
coffee
she
took
it
round
to
him
and
let
her
hand
rest
on
his
shoulder
lovingly
but
jason
had
brought
in
the
and
heron
was
unlocking
it
and
taking
out
the
few
letters
and
papers
and
seemed
unconscious
of
the
little
anxious
caress
are
there
any
for
me
father
she
asked
lingering
beside
him
and
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
turn
the
envelopes
on
their
right
side
but
he
stopped
her
quickly
and
swept
them
together
covering
them
with
his
long
hand
the
shapely
heron
hand
no
no
he
said
almost
sharply
they
are
all
for
me
they
are
business
letters
booksellers
catalogues
sale
catalogues
nothing
of
importance
she
went
back
to
her
place
and
he
waited
until
she
had
done
so
before
he
began
to
open
the
letters
he
merely
glanced
at
some
of
them
but
presently
he
came
to
one
which
after
a
sharp
quick
look
at
her
he
read
attentively
then
he
returned
it
to
its
envelope
and
with
a
secretive
movement
slipped
it
into
the
pocket
of
his
yes
nothing
but
catalogues
and
bills
you
better
take
them
ida
the
bills
at
any
rate
and
he
threw
them
across
to
her
when
she
had
first
come
home
to
be
mistress
of
the
hall
the
bills
had
overwhelmed
her
they
had
been
so
many
and
the
money
to
meet
them
had
been
so
inadequate
but
she
had
soon
learnt
how
to
finance
them
and
come
to
know
which
account
must
be
paid
at
once
and
which
might
be
allowed
to
stand
over
she
took
them
now
and
glanced
at
them
and
the
old
man
watched
her
covertly
with
a
curious
expression
on
his
face
i
sure
i
do
know
how
you
will
pay
them
he
said
as
if
she
alone
were
responsible
i
ca
pay
all
of
them
at
once
she
replied
cheerfully
but
i
can
some
and
the
rest
must
wait
i
can
send
four
perhaps
five
of
the
steers
to
the
monthly
market
and
then
there
are
the
sheep
oh
father
i
did
not
tell
you
about
the
gentleman
i
saw
fishing
in
the
dale
she
stopped
for
she
saw
that
he
was
not
listening
he
had
opened
a
local
paper
and
was
reading
it
intently
and
presently
he
looked
up
with
an
eager
flush
on
his
face
and
a
sudden
lightening
of
the
dull
eyes
have
you
seen
this
this
house
they
call
it
a
palace
which
that
man
has
built
on
the
lake
side
he
asked
his
thin
voice
quavering
with
resentment
do
you
mean
the
big
white
house
by
brae
wood
yes
judging
by
the
description
of
it
here
it
must
be
a
kind
of
villa
like
those
one
sees
in
italy
built
by
men
resembling
this
this
it
is
a
large
place
said
ida
but
i
do
think
it
is
father
it
looks
very
solid
though
it
is
white
and
yes
continental
it
is
something
between
a
tremendous
villa
and
a
palace
why
are
you
so
angry
i
know
you
do
like
to
have
new
houses
built
in
bryndermere
but
this
is
some
distance
from
us
we
can
not
see
it
from
here
or
from
any
part
of
the
grounds
excepting
the
piece
by
the
lake
it
is
built
on
our
land
he
said
more
quietly
but
with
the
flush
still
on
his
face
the
angry
light
in
his
eyes
it
was
bought
by
fraud
obtained
under
false
pretences
i
sold
it
to
one
of
the
farmers
thinking
he
wanted
it
and
would
only
use
it
for
grazing
i
did
not
know
until
the
deeds
were
signed
that
he
was
only
the
jackal
for
this
other
man
what
other
man
father
this
stephen
orme
he
stephen
orme
now
they
knighted
him
they
knight
every
successful
tradesman
and
schemer
and
this
man
is
a
prince
of
his
tribe
a
adventurer
a
of
the
worst
type
i
think
i
have
read
something
about
him
in
the
newspapers
said
ida
thoughtfully
heron
emitted
a
low
snarl
no
doubt
he
is
one
whom
the
world
delights
to
honour
it
bows
before
the
successful
charlatan
and
cringes
to
his
wealth
told
that
such
a
man
is
received
yes
and
welcomed
by
society
society
the
word
is
a
misnomer
in
my
time
a
man
of
that
class
was
kept
at
was
relegated
to
his
proper
place
the
back
hall
but
now
he
gazed
angrily
at
the
paper
here
is
a
whole
column
describing
sir
stephen
orme
new
villa
and
giving
an
account
of
his
achievements
the
success
of
his
great
undertakings
and
this
man
has
chosen
to
build
his
eyesore
on
heron
lands
within
sight
of
the
house
which
which
he
would
not
have
been
permitted
to
enter
if
i
had
known
i
would
not
have
sold
the
land
but
you
wanted
the
money
father
she
said
gently
he
looked
at
her
swiftly
and
a
change
came
over
his
face
a
look
of
caution
almost
of
cunning
eh
yes
yes
of
course
i
wanted
it
but
he
knew
i
should
not
have
sold
it
for
building
on
that
is
why
he
got
bowden
the
farmer
to
buy
it
it
was
like
him
only
such
a
man
can
be
capable
of
such
an
underhand
act
and
now
i
suppose
he
will
be
welcomed
by
his
neighbours
and
the
vaynes
and
the
bannerdales
and
made
much
of
they
eat
his
dinners
and
their
women
will
go
to
his
balls
and
concerts
they
whose
fathers
would
have
refused
to
sit
at
the
same
table
with
him
but
there
is
one
house
at
which
he
will
not
be
welcome
one
man
who
will
not
acknowledge
him
who
will
not
cross
the
threshold
of
sir
stephen
palace
or
invite
him
to
enter
his
own
he
shall
not
darken
the
doors
of
heron
hall
he
rose
as
he
spoke
and
left
the
room
with
a
quicker
step
than
usual
but
half
an
hour
later
when
ida
went
into
the
library
she
found
him
absorbed
in
his
books
as
usual
and
he
only
glanced
up
at
her
with
absent
unseeing
eyes
as
she
stood
beside
him
putting
on
her
gloves
her
habit
skirt
caught
up
under
her
elbow
the
old
felt
hat
just
a
little
askew
on
the
soft
silky
hair
do
you
want
anything
before
i
go
out
father
she
asked
no
no
he
replied
abstractedly
and
bending
over
his
book
again
as
he
answered
ida
crossed
the
hall
in
the
sunlight
which
lit
up
her
beauty
and
made
it
seem
a
more
striking
contrast
than
usual
to
the
dull
and
grim
surroundings
of
the
dark
oak
the
faded
hangings
and
the
armour
and
donald
and
bess
bounded
barking
before
her
down
the
terrace
at
which
jason
was
holding
the
big
chestnut
the
horse
pricked
up
its
ears
and
turned
its
head
for
her
morning
caress
the
touch
of
the
small
soft
but
firm
hand
which
it
had
come
to
regard
as
its
due
and
ida
sprang
lightly
from
the
last
step
into
the
saddle
it
was
an
informal
way
of
mounting
which
few
girls
could
have
accomplished
gracefully
but
ida
did
it
as
naturally
and
as
easily
as
a
circus
rider
for
the
trick
was
a
necessity
to
her
who
had
so
often
to
dismount
and
mount
alone
the
lovely
face
was
rather
grave
and
thoughtful
for
some
time
after
she
had
started
for
the
remembrance
of
last
night
weighed
upon
her
and
her
father
unusual
display
of
anger
at
breakfast
troubled
her
vaguely
but
presently
after
she
had
cleared
a
hedge
and
one
of
the
broken
rails
her
spirits
rose
the
sky
was
so
blue
the
sun
so
bright
it
was
hard
to
be
depressed
on
such
a
morning
she
rode
to
a
distant
part
of
the
dale
where
in
a
rough
meadow
the
steers
were
grazing
she
surveyed
them
critically
chose
those
that
should
go
to
market
then
turned
and
leaping
a
bank
gained
an
road
a
little
farther
on
she
came
to
an
opening
on
the
verge
of
the
lake
and
she
pulled
up
arrested
by
the
great
white
house
on
the
other
side
which
was
literally
glittering
in
the
brilliant
sunlight
it
certainly
did
not
detract
from
the
beauty
of
the
view
in
fact
it
made
the
english
lake
look
for
the
moment
like
an
italian
one
she
regarded
it
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
then
returned
to
the
road
and
as
she
did
so
she
saw
a
tall
figure
coming
towards
her
for
an
instant
the
colour
rose
to
her
face
but
for
an
instant
only
and
before
stafford
had
reached
her
she
was
as
pale
as
calm
as
usual
she
noticed
that
he
was
dressed
in
a
serge
suit
noticed
vaguely
how
well
it
sat
upon
him
that
his
gait
had
a
peculiar
ease
and
grace
which
the
men
of
the
dale
lacked
that
his
handsome
face
flushed
lightly
as
he
saw
her
but
she
gave
no
sign
of
these
quick
apprehensions
and
sat
cold
and
waiting
for
him
strafford
heart
leapt
at
sight
of
her
with
a
sudden
pleasure
which
puzzled
him
for
he
would
not
have
admitted
to
himself
that
he
had
walked
in
this
direction
in
the
hope
on
the
chance
of
meeting
her
he
said
in
his
direct
fashion
raising
his
cap
i
am
very
fortunate
to
meet
you
i
hope
heron
is
no
worse
for
is
not
ill
no
she
said
in
her
low
clear
voice
my
father
is
quite
well
he
is
just
as
he
usually
is
this
morning
i
am
very
glad
said
stafford
he
stood
close
beside
the
horse
and
looked
up
at
her
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
trying
to
keep
the
expression
of
admiration
out
of
his
eyes
the
expression
which
he
knew
most
women
welcomed
but
which
somehow
or
other
he
felt
this
strange
girl
would
resent
i
was
afraid
he
would
be
upset
i
am
afraid
you
were
frightened
last
night
it
was
enough
to
alarm
to
startle
anyone
what
a
splendid
morning
he
went
on
quickly
as
if
he
did
not
want
to
remind
her
of
the
affair
what
a
libel
it
is
to
say
that
it
is
always
raining
here
i
never
seen
so
brilliant
a
sunshine
or
such
colours
do
wonder
that
the
artists
rave
about
the
place
and
are
never
tired
of
painting
it
she
waited
until
he
had
finished
her
eyes
downcast
as
if
she
knew
why
he
had
turned
from
the
subject
then
she
raised
them
and
looked
at
him
with
her
direct
gaze
i
am
glad
i
have
met
you
she
said
i
wanted
to
thank
you
for
your
kindness
last
night
oh
but
stafford
tried
to
break
in
but
she
went
on
slowly
as
if
he
had
not
spoken
i
was
frightened
it
was
sudden
so
unexpected
my
father
had
never
done
it
before
that
i
know
of
and
he
looked
her
voice
broke
for
a
moment
so
strange
so
i
thought
at
first
that
it
was
the
heron
ghost
which
they
say
haunts
the
dale
though
i
have
never
seen
it
a
faint
smile
curved
her
lips
and
shone
in
her
eyes
and
stafford
was
so
fascinated
by
the
sudden
gleam
of
girlishness
that
he
had
to
bend
and
pat
bess
who
was
planting
dusty
impression
on
his
trousers
in
her
frantic
efforts
to
gain
his
attention
i
did
nothing
in
fact
as
i
walked
away
i
was
fuming
because
i
could
help
you
could
do
more
you
did
help
me
she
said
gravely
then
she
looked
across
the
lake
to
sir
stephen
little
place
i
was
admiring
that
new
house
you
think
it
is
very
beautiful
rising
so
white
and
gracefully
above
the
lake
said
stafford
rather
conspicuous
though
is
it
she
laughed
suddenly
and
stafford
asked
with
surprise
why
did
you
laugh
oh
i
was
thinking
of
my
father
she
said
with
a
delicious
frankness
he
was
quite
angry
about
it
this
morning
it
seems
that
it
is
built
on
our
land
or
what
was
ours
and
he
dislikes
the
idea
of
anyone
building
at
bryndermere
so
should
i
said
stafford
laconically
and
besides
she
went
on
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
great
white
building
so
that
she
did
not
see
his
embarrassment
my
father
does
not
like
the
man
who
built
it
he
thinks
that
he
got
the
land
unfairly
and
he
my
father
calls
him
all
sorts
of
hard
names
stafford
bit
his
lips
and
his
face
wore
the
expression
which
came
into
it
when
he
was
facing
an
ugly
jump
he
would
have
shirked
this
one
if
he
could
but
it
had
to
be
faced
so
he
rushed
it
i
sorry
he
said
my
father
built
it
she
did
not
start
but
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
at
him
with
a
sudden
coldness
in
the
glorious
eyes
your
father
sir
stephen
orme
then
you
are
i
am
his
son
yes
my
name
is
stafford
orme
she
gathered
her
reins
up
as
if
no
comment
no
remark
were
necessary
but
stafford
could
not
let
her
go
could
not
part
from
her
like
that
i
sorry
to
hear
that
heron
has
some
cause
of
complaint
some
grievance
against
my
father
i
can
understand
his
not
liking
the
house
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
care
for
it
much
myself
yes
i
can
understand
heron
annoyance
i
suppose
he
can
see
it
from
your
house
no
she
said
simply
this
is
the
only
part
of
our
land
from
which
it
can
be
seen
and
my
father
never
comes
here
never
leaves
the
grounds
the
garden
she
paused
a
moment
i
do
know
why
you
should
mind
except
that
i
said
that
the
land
was
got
unfairly
i
wish
i
had
not
said
that
stafford
coloured
so
do
i
he
said
but
i
hope
it
is
true
there
may
be
some
mistake
i
do
know
anything
about
my
father
affairs
i
seen
him
for
years
i
am
almost
a
stranger
to
him
she
listened
with
a
grave
face
then
she
touched
the
big
chestnut
but
stafford
almost
unconsciously
laid
his
hand
on
the
rein
nearest
him
his
mouth
and
chin
expressed
the
determination
which
now
and
again
surprised
even
his
most
intimate
friends
miss
heron
i
afraid
he
paused
and
she
waited
her
eyes
downcast
and
fixed
on
the
horse
ears
i
scarcely
know
how
to
put
what
i
want
to
say
he
said
i
rather
bad
at
explaining
myself
but
i
well
i
hope
you
wo
feel
angry
with
me
because
of
the
house
because
of
anything
that
has
passed
between
your
father
and
mine
of
course
i
stand
by
him
but
well
build
the
confounded
place
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
think
it
rather
hard
that
you
should
cut
me
oh
i
can
see
by
your
face
that
you
mean
to
do
it
that
you
should
regard
me
as
a
kind
of
enemy
because
the
usually
fluent
stafford
stopped
helplessly
as
the
beautiful
eyes
turned
slowly
upon
him
with
a
slight
look
of
wonder
in
them
why
should
you
mind
she
said
with
almost
childish
innocence
you
do
not
know
me
we
only
met
yesterday
we
are
not
friends
oh
i
am
not
forgetting
your
kindness
last
night
oh
no
but
what
can
it
matter
to
you
in
another
woman
stafford
would
have
suspected
the
question
of
coquetry
of
a
desire
to
fish
for
the
inevitable
response
but
looking
in
those
clear
guileless
eyes
he
could
not
entertain
any
such
suspicion
i
beg
your
pardon
but
it
does
matter
very
much
he
retorted
in
the
first
place
a
man
does
not
like
being
cut
by
a
lady
and
in
the
next
we
shall
be
neighbours
i
going
to
stay
there
he
nodded
grimly
at
the
beautiful
little
place
neighbours
she
said
half
absently
it
is
farther
off
than
you
think
and
besides
we
know
no
one
we
have
no
neighbours
in
that
sense
or
friends
my
father
does
not
like
to
see
anyone
we
live
quite
alone
so
i
heard
he
stopped
and
bit
his
lip
but
she
did
not
seem
to
have
noticed
his
interruption
so
that
even
if
my
father
did
not
object
to
the
house
or
or
my
father
said
stafford
with
a
smile
a
smile
answered
his
candour
it
would
be
all
the
same
and
why
should
it
matter
to
you
you
have
a
great
many
friends
no
doubt
and
we
should
not
be
likely
to
meet
oh
yes
we
should
he
said
with
the
dogged
kind
of
insistence
which
also
sometimes
surprised
his
friends
i
was
going
to
avail
myself
of
your
permission
and
fish
the
stream
but
of
course
i
ca
do
that
now
no
i
suppose
not
she
assented
but
we
should
be
sure
to
meet
on
the
road
i
should
be
riding
walking
but
not
on
this
side
often
she
argued
a
faint
very
faint
colour
had
stolen
into
the
clear
pallor
of
her
cheek
her
eyes
were
downcast
she
was
honestly
surprised
and
yes
a
little
pleased
that
he
should
protest
against
the
close
of
their
acquaintance
pleased
though
why
she
could
not
have
told
for
it
did
not
seem
to
matter
oh
yes
i
should
he
retorted
it
very
pretty
this
side
and
see
here
miss
heron
he
drew
a
little
nearer
and
looked
up
at
her
with
something
like
a
frown
in
his
eagerness
of
course
i
shall
speak
to
my
father
about
well
about
the
way
the
land
was
bought
and
i
hoping
i
sure
that
he
will
be
able
to
explain
it
satisfactorily
and
i
want
to
tell
you
that
it
is
a
mistake
i
do
know
much
of
my
father
but
i
ca
believe
that
he
would
do
anything
underhand
he
stopped
suddenly
as
the
bagman
remarks
flashed
across
his
memory
if
your
grievance
against
him
is
just
why
ah
well
you
have
to
cut
me
when
we
meet
but
i
do
think
it
is
and
i
do
think
it
would
be
fair
to
treat
me
as
if
done
something
wrong
her
brows
came
together
and
she
looked
at
him
as
if
she
were
puzzled
i
do
know
why
it
matters
she
said
well
i
ca
tell
you
he
said
helplessly
i
only
know
that
i
do
want
to
part
from
you
this
morning
knowing
that
the
next
time
we
meet
we
should
meet
as
strangers
i
wanted
to
come
to
the
hall
to
enquire
after
mr
heron
her
face
flushed
do
not
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
wo
of
course
he
responded
quickly
it
would
only
make
matters
worse
your
father
would
naturally
dislike
me
refuse
to
see
me
but
well
it
very
hard
on
me
she
looked
at
him
again
gravely
thoughtfully
as
if
she
were
still
puzzled
by
his
persistence
her
eyes
wandered
to
the
dogs
bess
was
still
standing
up
against
him
and
donald
had
thrown
himself
down
beside
him
and
was
regarding
ida
with
an
air
that
said
quite
plainly
this
new
friend
of
yours
is
all
right
you
have
made
friends
with
the
dogs
she
said
with
a
slight
smile
stafford
laughed
oh
yes
there
must
be
some
good
in
dumb
animals
for
most
of
take
to
me
at
first
sight
she
laughed
at
this
not
very
brilliant
display
of
wit
i
assure
you
they
would
cut
me
next
time
we
met
you
ca
be
less
charitable
than
the
dogs
miss
heron
she
gave
a
slight
shrug
to
her
straight
square
shoulders
the
gesture
seemed
charming
to
stafford
in
its
girlish
frenchiness
ah
well
she
said
with
a
pretty
air
of
resignation
as
if
she
were
tired
of
arguing
stafford
face
lit
up
and
he
laughed
the
laugh
of
the
man
who
wins
but
it
died
away
rather
suddenly
as
she
said
gravely
but
i
do
not
think
we
shall
meet
often
i
do
not
often
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
lake
very
seldom
indeed
and
you
will
not
you
say
fish
the
heron
so
that
oh
there
is
the
colt
loose
she
broke
off
how
can
it
have
got
out
i
meant
to
ride
it
and
jason
thinking
i
had
changed
my
mind
must
have
turned
it
out
the
colt
came
waltzing
joyously
along
the
road
and
catching
sight
of
the
chestnut
whinnied
delightedly
and
the
chestnut
responded
with
one
short
whinny
of
reproof
ida
rode
forward
and
headed
the
colt
and
stafford
quietly
slid
along
by
the
hedge
and
got
behind
it
take
care
said
ida
it
is
very
strong
what
are
you
going
to
do
stafford
did
not
reply
but
stole
up
to
the
truant
step
by
step
cautiously
and
gradually
approached
near
enough
to
lay
his
hand
on
its
shoulder
from
its
shoulder
he
worked
to
its
neck
and
wound
his
arms
round
it
ida
laughed
oh
you
ca
hold
it
she
said
as
the
colt
plunged
but
stafford
hung
on
tightly
and
yet
so
to
speak
gently
soothing
the
animal
with
the
horse
language
with
which
every
man
who
loves
them
is
acquainted
ida
sat
for
an
instant
looking
round
with
a
puzzled
frown
then
she
slipped
down
took
the
bridle
off
the
chestnut
and
slipped
it
on
the
colt
the
chestnut
who
evidently
understood
the
business
standing
stock
still
now
i
hold
it
it
will
be
quieter
with
me
if
you
will
please
change
the
saddle
unthinkingly
stafford
obeyed
and
got
the
saddle
on
the
jigging
and
dancing
youngster
as
unthinkingly
he
put
ida
up
and
it
was
not
until
the
colt
rose
on
its
hind
legs
that
he
remembered
to
ask
her
if
the
horse
were
broken
scarcely
she
said
with
a
laugh
but
it
will
be
all
right
and
thank
you
and
calling
to
the
chestnut
she
turned
the
colt
and
tore
off
the
chestnut
and
the
dogs
scampering
after
her
stafford
face
grew
hot
for
a
moment
with
fear
for
her
then
it
grew
hotter
with
admiration
as
he
watched
her
skimming
across
the
moor
in
the
direction
of
the
hall
once
just
before
she
vanished
from
his
sight
she
turned
and
waved
her
hand
to
him
as
if
to
assure
him
that
she
was
safe
the
gesture
reminded
him
of
the
white
figure
standing
in
the
doorway
last
night
and
something
stirred
in
his
heart
and
sent
a
warm
thrill
through
him
in
all
his
life
he
had
never
seen
anyone
like
her
chapter
you
look
rather
serious
oh
my
prince
said
howard
as
some
few
hours
later
he
leisurely
climbed
into
the
phaeton
beside
stafford
i
have
noticed
with
inward
satisfaction
that
as
we
approach
the
moment
of
meeting
with
your
puissant
parent
the
sultan
an
air
of
gravity
and
soberness
has
clouded
that
confoundedly
careless
countenance
of
yours
i
say
with
inward
satisfaction
because
with
my
usual
candour
i
do
mind
admitting
that
i
am
shivering
in
my
shoes
the
shadow
of
the
august
presence
is
already
falling
on
me
and
as
the
hour
draws
near
i
feel
my
littleness
my
utter
insignificance
with
an
acuteness
which
almost
compels
me
to
ask
you
to
let
me
get
down
and
make
my
way
back
to
london
as
best
i
can
do
be
an
ass
retorted
stafford
rather
absently
you
ask
an
impossibility
of
me
my
dear
fellow
but
i
will
try
and
conceal
my
asininity
as
best
i
can
may
i
ask
to
change
the
subject
where
you
were
wandering
all
the
morning
stafford
coloured
slightly
and
bestowed
minute
attention
to
the
off
horse
oh
just
prowling
round
he
replied
leisurely
you
tempt
me
to
finish
the
quotation
did
you
find
anyone
to
devour
apropos
has
his
majesty
the
sultan
ever
mentioned
matrimony
to
you
staff
stafford
looked
round
at
him
for
an
instant
no
he
said
curtly
what
the
devil
made
you
ask
merely
my
incessant
speculation
as
to
your
future
my
dear
fellow
replied
howard
blandly
most
fathers
are
ambitious
for
their
sons
and
i
should
imagine
that
sir
stephen
would
be
extremely
so
when
a
man
is
simply
a
plain
he
longs
for
the
when
he
gets
the
he
wants
the
lord
for
himself
or
for
his
son
and
heir
that
is
the
worst
of
ambition
you
ca
satisfy
it
i
have
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
at
this
very
moment
sir
stephen
is
making
for
a
peerage
for
himself
or
you
he
can
possibly
gain
his
but
you
having
no
brains
to
speak
of
the
fact
that
men
are
always
deficient
in
that
respect
is
a
continual
and
blessed
consolation
to
us
plain
ones
staff
will
have
to
make
what
the
world
calls
a
marriage
doubtless
your
father
already
has
the
future
bride
in
his
eye
the
daughter
of
a
peer
high
in
the
government
perhaps
in
the
cabinet
probably
probably
that
is
why
he
has
asked
you
to
meet
him
here
i
hope
for
your
sake
that
she
is
i
fancy
musingly
that
you
would
be
rather
particular
if
rumour
does
you
no
injustice
you
always
have
been
stafford
laughed
shortly
i
never
thought
about
marrying
he
said
rather
absently
no
one
does
my
dear
fellow
it
comes
like
measles
and
other
unpleasant
things
without
thought
and
when
it
comes
it
is
generally
as
unpleasant
are
we
going
at
a
tremendous
rate
stafford
think
i
am
nervous
i
have
ridden
beside
you
too
often
for
that
you
destroyed
what
nerve
i
possessed
long
ago
we
are
late
and
it
farther
round
than
i
thought
said
stafford
the
horses
are
fresh
i
daresay
very
probably
pottinger
has
given
them
a
double
feed
he
would
naturally
like
them
to
dash
up
in
fine
style
but
if
it
all
the
same
to
you
as
the
horses
broke
into
a
gallop
i
should
prefer
to
arrive
at
your
father
place
in
a
more
dignified
fashion
than
on
a
stretcher
stafford
smiled
and
checked
the
pair
you
talk
of
women
as
if
they
were
a
a
kind
of
plague
you
were
never
in
love
howard
he
asked
never
thank
heaven
responded
howard
devoutly
when
i
think
of
it
i
acknowledge
that
i
have
much
to
be
thankful
for
i
was
once
she
was
a
girl
with
dark
eyes
but
i
will
spare
you
a
minute
description
i
met
her
in
a
country
rectory
that
horse
i
think
you
call
it
the
near
one
going
to
jump
over
the
bank
and
one
remarkably
fine
evening
it
was
moonlight
i
remember
i
was
on
the
point
of
declaring
my
love
and
then
the
gods
saved
me
the
thought
flashed
upon
me
that
if
she
said
i
should
have
to
sit
opposite
her
at
dinner
for
the
rest
of
one
of
our
lives
it
saved
me
i
said
that
i
thought
it
was
chilly
and
went
in
and
up
to
bed
grateful
for
my
escape
why
do
you
laugh
stafford
only
smiled
in
a
perfunctory
fashion
he
was
thinking
of
the
girl
he
had
watched
riding
off
on
the
unbroken
colt
of
what
it
would
seem
like
if
she
were
seated
opposite
him
with
the
falling
on
her
soft
white
dress
with
diamonds
gleaming
in
it
diamonds
outshone
by
the
splendour
of
those
dark
eyes
of
what
it
would
seem
like
if
he
could
rise
from
his
seat
and
go
to
her
and
take
her
in
his
arms
and
look
into
those
dark
grey
eyes
and
say
you
are
mine
mine
with
no
one
to
say
him
nay
it
was
a
lucky
escape
for
her
he
said
dreamily
it
was
assented
howard
solemnly
not
one
man
in
a
thousand
can
love
one
woman
all
his
life
and
i
the
strongest
conviction
that
i
am
not
that
one
in
less
than
six
months
i
should
have
grown
tired
of
her
in
less
than
a
year
i
should
have
flown
from
the
joys
of
matrimony
or
killed
the
partner
of
those
joys
has
pottinger
a
wife
and
family
my
dear
stafford
if
so
is
it
wise
to
risk
his
life
in
this
fashion
i
do
care
for
myself
though
still
young
i
am
not
afraid
to
die
and
i
would
as
soon
meet
it
hurled
from
a
phaeton
as
not
but
may
i
beg
of
you
to
think
of
pottinger
stafford
laughed
the
horses
are
all
right
he
said
they
are
only
fresh
and
want
to
go
he
could
not
have
driven
slowly
for
his
mind
dwelling
on
the
girl
in
the
habit
was
electric
i
have
spared
you
hitherto
any
laudation
of
the
scenery
my
dear
staff
said
howard
pleasantly
but
permit
me
to
remark
that
it
really
is
very
beautiful
trust
the
great
and
powerful
sir
stephen
to
choose
the
best
nature
and
art
can
produce
what
is
this
this
proved
to
be
a
newly
built
lodge
which
appeared
on
the
left
of
the
road
stafford
slowed
up
and
a
lodgekeeper
came
and
flung
open
the
new
and
elaborately
wrought
iron
gates
this
the
way
to
to
sir
stephen
house
asked
stafford
the
man
touched
his
hat
reverentially
yes
sir
he
replied
sir
stephen
arrived
came
an
hour
ago
stafford
nodded
and
drove
on
the
road
was
certainly
a
new
one
but
it
was
lined
with
rhododendrons
and
costly
shrubs
and
it
wound
and
wound
serpentine
fashion
through
shrubberies
and
miniature
plantations
which
indicated
not
only
remarkably
good
taste
but
vast
expenditure
at
intervals
the
trees
had
been
felled
to
permit
a
view
of
the
lake
lying
below
like
a
sapphire
glowing
in
the
sunlight
presently
they
came
in
sight
of
the
house
it
was
larger
than
it
had
looked
in
the
distance
a
veritable
palace
an
architect
had
received
and
disporting
himself
right
royally
had
designed
a
façade
which
it
would
be
hard
to
beat
at
any
rate
in
england
stafford
eyed
it
rather
grumpily
most
englishmen
dislike
ostentation
and
display
and
to
stafford
the
place
seemed
garish
and
loud
howard
surveyed
it
with
cynical
admiration
a
dream
of
kubla
kahn
do
know
whether
i
got
the
name
right
poem
of
coleridge
you
know
but
of
course
you
do
know
you
go
in
for
poetry
well
i
bound
to
admit
that
it
striking
not
to
say
beautiful
he
went
on
as
the
horses
sprang
up
the
last
ascent
and
rattled
on
in
an
impatient
trot
along
the
level
road
to
the
terrace
fronting
the
entrance
as
stafford
pulled
up
a
couple
of
grooms
came
forward
the
hall
door
enamelled
in
peacock
blue
opened
and
a
butler
and
two
footmen
in
rich
maroon
livery
appeared
they
came
down
the
white
marble
steps
in
stately
fashion
and
ranged
themselves
as
if
the
ceremony
were
of
vast
importance
and
as
howard
and
stafford
got
down
they
bowed
with
the
air
of
attendants
receiving
royalty
as
stafford
flinging
the
reins
to
one
of
the
grooms
got
down
he
caught
sight
of
a
line
of
liveried
servants
in
the
hall
and
he
frowned
slightly
like
most
young
englishmen
he
hated
ostentation
which
he
designated
as
fuss
rub
down
well
pottinger
he
said
and
he
leisurely
patted
the
horses
while
the
gorgeous
footmen
watched
with
solemn
impressiveness
we
brought
along
pretty
well
he
said
turning
to
howard
who
stood
beside
him
with
a
fine
and
cynical
smile
then
he
went
up
the
white
marble
steps
slowly
carefully
ignoring
the
footmen
who
had
drawn
themselves
into
a
line
as
if
they
were
a
guard
of
honour
specially
drilled
to
receive
him
followed
by
howard
his
cynical
smile
still
lingering
about
his
thin
lips
stafford
entered
the
hall
it
was
oriental
in
shape
and
design
with
a
marble
fountain
in
the
centre
and
carved
arches
before
the
various
passages
the
principal
staircase
was
also
of
white
marble
with
an
indian
carpet
of
vivid
crimson
palms
reared
their
tall
and
graceful
heads
at
intervals
shading
statuary
in
the
prevailing
white
marble
hangings
of
rose
colour
broke
the
sameness
and
accentuated
the
purity
of
the
predominate
whiteness
howard
looked
round
with
an
admiration
which
obliterated
his
usual
cynicism
beautiful
he
murmured
but
stafford
frowned
the
luxury
the
richness
of
the
place
though
chaste
jarred
on
him
why
he
could
not
have
told
suddenly
as
they
were
making
their
way
through
the
lines
of
richly
liveried
servants
a
curtain
at
one
of
the
openings
was
thrown
aside
and
a
gentleman
came
out
to
meet
them
he
was
rather
a
tall
man
with
white
hair
but
with
eyebrows
and
moustache
of
his
eyes
were
brilliant
but
sharp
and
he
moved
with
the
ease
and
alertness
of
youth
there
was
something
in
his
face
in
its
expression
which
indicated
strength
and
power
something
in
his
manner
in
his
smile
peculiarly
electric
and
sympathetic
howard
stopped
and
drew
back
but
stafford
advanced
and
sir
stephen
caught
him
by
the
hand
and
held
it
my
dear
stafford
my
dear
boy
he
said
in
a
deep
but
musical
voice
i
expected
you
hours
ago
i
have
been
waiting
but
better
late
than
never
who
is
this
your
friend
howard
certainly
how
do
you
do
howard
welcome
to
our
little
villa
on
the
lake
chapter
vi
stafford
heart
warmed
at
his
father
greeting
indeed
it
would
have
been
a
very
callous
heart
if
it
had
not
for
the
emotion
of
genuine
affection
shone
in
sir
stephen
brilliant
eyes
and
rang
in
his
musical
voice
stafford
was
all
the
more
impressed
and
touched
because
the
emotion
was
unusual
or
rather
the
expression
of
it
this
is
a
casual
age
in
which
a
man
parts
from
or
meets
his
relations
and
friends
with
the
real
or
assumed
indifference
which
is
ordained
by
fashion
it
is
bad
form
to
display
one
affection
even
for
the
woman
one
loves
excepting
in
extreme
seclusion
and
privacy
if
you
meet
your
dearest
chum
who
has
just
come
out
of
the
transvaal
war
by
the
skin
of
his
teeth
it
is
not
permitted
you
to
say
more
than
ah
er
how
d
do
got
back
then
old
man
and
at
parting
from
one
nearest
relative
perhaps
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
one
must
hide
the
grief
that
racks
the
heart
with
an
enquiry
as
to
whether
he
has
got
a
comfortable
berth
and
has
remembered
his
umbrella
but
sir
stephen
was
evidently
not
ashamed
of
his
pleasure
and
delight
at
the
sight
of
his
son
and
he
wrung
his
hand
and
looked
him
up
and
down
with
an
affectionate
and
proud
scrutiny
you
looking
fit
stafford
very
fit
by
george
i
i
believe
grown
and
you
got
uglier
than
ever
then
still
holding
stafford
hand
he
turned
with
a
smile
to
howard
you
must
forgive
me
howard
i
not
seen
this
boy
of
mine
for
a
devil
of
a
time
and
i
been
looking
forward
to
this
meeting
very
keenly
the
fond
parent
you
know
eh
but
now
let
me
say
again
how
pleased
i
am
to
see
you
stafford
has
often
mentioned
you
his
closest
chum
and
i
was
almost
as
anxious
to
see
you
as
i
was
to
see
him
you
are
very
kind
sir
stephen
said
howard
his
slow
drawl
unusually
quickened
for
he
too
was
touched
though
he
would
have
died
rather
than
have
admitted
it
by
the
warmth
of
sir
stephen
reception
of
his
son
i
was
afraid
that
i
should
be
rather
if
not
absolutely
intrusive
not
at
all
not
at
all
sir
stephen
broke
in
my
boy
friends
are
mine
especially
his
own
particular
pal
you
are
david
and
jonathan
you
two
i
know
and
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
part
you
if
consider
yourself
one
of
the
family
free
to
come
and
go
just
as
you
choose
i
shall
feel
grateful
to
you
yes
that
the
word
grateful
all
this
was
said
in
the
heartiest
way
with
the
crowd
of
servants
looking
on
and
listening
though
like
servants
they
appeared
both
deaf
and
blind
for
all
the
expression
that
could
be
seen
in
their
faces
then
sir
stephen
led
the
way
into
the
you
just
time
to
dress
he
said
consulting
his
watch
your
man
measom
has
turned
up
stafford
howard
will
permit
me
to
offer
him
the
services
of
my
valet
i
do
trouble
him
much
and
now
i
show
you
your
rooms
like
this
he
added
as
he
paused
at
the
door
and
looked
round
it
one
of
the
smaller
rooms
the
ladies
can
keep
it
for
themselves
if
they
like
charming
said
howard
and
the
word
was
appropriate
enough
to
the
dainty
apartment
with
its
chaste
decorations
of
crushed
strawberry
and
gold
with
hangings
and
furniture
to
match
with
its
grand
piano
in
carved
white
wood
and
its
series
of
water
colours
by
some
of
the
best
of
the
institute
men
i
glad
responded
sir
stephen
but
i
must
keep
you
we
go
over
the
place
after
dinner
or
some
other
time
we
are
alone
the
party
does
come
up
till
i
wanted
to
have
you
stafford
and
your
friend
to
myself
before
the
crowd
arrived
they
followed
him
up
the
broad
stairs
which
by
low
and
easy
steps
led
up
to
the
exquisite
corridor
harmonising
perfectly
with
the
eastern
hall
on
to
which
it
looked
through
arches
shaped
and
fitted
in
oriental
fashion
here
is
your
room
ah
measom
here
is
stafford
got
everything
ready
for
him
i
hope
and
here
next
door
almost
is
howard
this
is
a
snuggery
in
between
keep
your
books
and
guns
and
in
it
do
you
know
howard
you
play
i
think
there
a
piano
hope
you
like
the
view
full
south
with
nothing
between
you
and
the
lake
i
not
far
off
see
just
opposite
you
may
find
the
rooms
too
hot
stafford
howard
and
we
change
of
course
do
hurry
hope
you
find
everything
you
want
he
laid
his
hand
on
stafford
shoulder
and
nodded
at
him
with
frank
affection
before
he
went
and
as
he
closed
the
door
they
heard
him
say
to
some
one
below
do
serve
the
dinner
till
stafford
comes
down
stafford
went
to
the
window
and
howard
stood
in
silence
beside
him
for
a
moment
then
he
said
measom
had
left
the
room
i
congratulate
you
staff
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
i
confess
i
thought
that
kind
of
father
only
existed
in
women
books
and
emotional
plays
stafford
nodded
he
he
kindness
itself
he
said
in
a
very
low
voice
and
not
turning
his
head
i
did
know
that
he
was
like
this
i
did
know
he
cared
it
evident
he
cares
very
much
said
howard
gravely
if
you
were
the
prodigal
son
he
could
have
felt
it
more
and
yet
they
say
that
bagman
said
muttered
stafford
with
smouldering
rage
and
indignation
there
are
few
things
in
my
life
that
i
regret
my
dear
staff
but
till
my
dying
day
i
shall
regret
that
i
did
not
turn
and
rend
that
bagman
he
a
splendid
fellow
splendid
now
i
seen
him
i
do
wonder
at
his
success
envy
is
not
one
of
my
numerous
vices
staff
but
frankly
i
envy
you
your
father
wake
up
old
man
we
must
keep
him
waiting
what
quarters
he
looked
round
the
room
as
he
moved
to
go
fit
for
a
prince
but
you
a
prince
why
dash
it
i
feel
like
a
prince
myself
how
are
you
measom
got
down
all
right
then
i
give
you
a
knock
when
i
ready
stafford
stafford
dressed
quickly
thinking
all
the
while
of
his
father
of
his
good
looks
his
deep
pleasant
voice
his
affectionate
welcome
and
thrusting
from
him
the
unfavourable
impression
which
the
ornate
splendour
of
the
place
had
made
howard
knocked
presently
and
the
two
men
went
down
sir
stephen
was
waiting
in
the
hall
and
stafford
with
a
little
thrill
of
pride
noticed
that
he
looked
still
more
distinguished
in
his
which
was
strikingly
plain
a
single
pearl
but
it
was
priceless
one
was
its
only
ornament
by
george
you
have
been
quick
said
sir
stephen
with
his
genial
smile
that
one
for
yourself
sir
said
stafford
oh
i
i
can
dress
in
five
minutes
responded
sir
stephen
linking
his
arm
in
stafford
i
almost
as
good
as
a
artist
he
drew
aside
to
let
howard
follow
the
butler
between
the
two
footmen
drawn
up
beside
the
door
and
they
entered
the
it
was
of
choice
american
walnut
and
lit
by
electric
lights
in
which
the
plate
and
the
glass
the
flowers
and
the
napery
glowed
softly
an
ideal
room
which
must
have
filled
the
famous
decorator
who
had
designed
it
with
just
pride
and
elation
the
table
had
been
reduced
to
a
small
oval
and
the
servants
proceeded
to
serve
a
dinner
which
told
howard
that
sir
stephen
had
become
possessed
of
a
who
was
a
the
wines
were
as
choice
as
the
but
sir
stephen
watered
his
chateau
claret
and
ate
but
little
excusing
himself
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
with
i
setting
you
a
bad
example
but
there
always
a
skeleton
at
my
feast
a
rather
common
one
nowadays
they
call
him
gout
and
so
you
drove
down
that
must
have
been
pleasant
it
a
pretty
country
so
told
i
did
see
much
of
it
from
the
train
but
the
lake
ah
well
it
indescribable
is
it
after
all
one
sees
one
is
bound
to
admit
that
there
is
nothing
to
beat
english
scenery
of
course
i
include
irish
we
a
strain
of
irish
blood
in
us
howard
and
i
always
stand
up
for
the
ould
counthry
things
are
looking
up
there
lately
we
beginning
to
be
appreciated
give
us
a
year
or
two
and
we
have
all
the
world
and
his
wife
scampering
over
it
i
a
little
irish
scheme
of
my
own
but
i
must
bore
you
the
first
night
howard
if
that
wine
is
too
thin
howard
clutched
his
glass
with
dramatic
intensity
chateau
legrange
if
i
not
mistaken
sir
he
said
but
let
it
be
what
it
may
it
simply
perfect
i
glad
see
here
now
it
understood
between
us
that
if
anything
you
want
anything
you
like
altered
you
say
so
eh
stafford
he
said
with
an
affectionate
anxiety
i
a
kind
of
man
and
anything
pleases
me
but
you
ah
well
you
two
have
the
right
to
be
particular
and
i
ask
you
to
ask
for
just
what
you
want
and
be
sure
you
get
it
stafford
glanced
round
the
room
with
its
costly
appointments
and
sir
stephen
caught
the
glance
and
smiled
you
thinking
ah
well
no
matter
howard
try
those
strawberries
i
do
think
they
forced
they
tell
me
that
they
get
them
on
the
slope
even
earlier
than
this
this
port
now
see
how
nice
the
people
in
these
parts
are
this
port
came
from
the
landlord
of
the
the
yes
the
woodman
inn
he
sent
it
with
his
respectful
compliments
saying
you
did
him
the
honour
to
praise
it
last
night
you
stayed
there
i
suppose
surprisingly
kind
quite
a
spanish
bit
of
courtesy
i
wrote
yes
groves
a
note
thanking
him
on
your
behalf
and
i
sent
him
some
dry
sherry
which
stenson
here
he
smiled
at
the
butler
tells
me
is
rather
good
eh
stenson
the
solemn
gravity
of
stenson
face
did
not
relax
in
the
slightest
as
he
murmured
count
de
meza
sir
right
so
long
as
it
was
the
best
we
had
you
approve
stafford
eh
stafford
nodded
with
something
more
than
approval
thank
you
sir
he
said
simply
we
admired
groves
port
he
a
good
fellow
i
hope
he
enjoy
the
sherry
i
shall
take
the
first
opportunity
of
calling
and
expressing
my
sense
of
his
kindness
no
more
shall
we
have
the
coffee
with
the
cigars
in
the
billiard
room
the
footmen
escorted
them
through
the
to
the
only
divided
from
it
by
a
screen
of
eastern
draped
by
costly
hangings
there
were
inlaid
tables
and
couches
of
exquisite
workmanship
and
a
moresque
cabinet
which
the
butler
unlocked
and
from
which
he
took
cigars
and
cigarettes
sir
stephen
waved
them
to
seats
and
sank
into
a
low
chair
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
and
enjoyment
the
footmen
placed
the
exquisite
of
limoges
enamel
on
one
of
the
tables
and
as
they
left
the
room
howard
as
if
he
could
not
help
himself
said
this
is
a
veritable
aladdin
palace
sir
stephen
though
i
can
imagine
that
fabulous
erection
can
not
have
been
as
comfortable
as
this
i
glad
you
like
it
he
said
but
do
you
like
it
he
put
in
with
a
shrewd
gleam
in
his
eyes
which
could
be
keen
as
well
as
brilliant
and
genial
i
fancy
you
think
it
fine
eh
stafford
he
laid
his
hand
on
stafford
knee
with
a
somewhat
appealing
gesture
and
glance
i
seen
a
doubt
on
your
face
once
or
twice
and
by
george
you
have
seen
half
the
place
yet
yes
howard
i
admit
that
it
is
rather
luxurious
that
the
result
of
giving
these
new
men
they
take
you
at
your
word
sir
i
own
up
i
was
a
little
surprised
for
i
told
them
to
build
me
a
villa
but
then
i
wanted
thirty
or
forty
bedrooms
so
i
suppose
they
had
to
make
it
rather
large
it
seemed
to
me
that
as
it
overlooks
the
lake
it
ought
to
be
after
the
style
of
those
places
one
sees
in
italy
and
i
hinted
that
for
the
interior
an
oriental
style
might
be
suitable
but
i
left
them
a
free
hand
and
if
they
overdone
it
they
ought
to
have
known
better
i
employed
the
men
who
were
recommended
to
me
there
was
a
pause
for
a
moment
stafford
tried
to
find
some
phrase
which
would
conceal
his
lack
of
appreciation
and
his
father
as
if
he
saw
what
was
passing
through
stafford
mind
went
on
quickly
but
smoothly
yes
i
see
it
too
fine
and
ornamental
but
i
do
think
find
that
the
people
who
are
coming
here
tomorrow
will
agree
with
you
i
may
not
know
much
about
art
and
taste
but
i
know
my
world
stafford
howard
i
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
i
built
this
place
with
an
object
my
dear
sir
you
wo
think
me
guilty
of
sticking
it
up
to
please
stafford
here
i
know
his
taste
too
well
something
like
mine
i
expect
a
cosy
room
with
a
clean
cloth
and
a
chop
and
potato
i
cooked
myself
before
now
the
former
on
a
shovel
the
latter
in
an
empty
of
course
i
know
that
stafford
and
you
howard
have
lived
very
different
lives
to
mine
of
course
you
have
been
accustomed
to
every
refinement
and
a
great
deal
of
luxury
over
since
you
left
the
cradle
quite
right
delighted
that
it
should
be
so
nothing
is
too
good
for
stafford
here
and
his
chum
nothing
stafford
handsome
face
flushed
you
been
very
generous
to
me
sir
he
said
in
his
brief
way
but
with
a
glance
at
his
father
which
expressed
more
than
the
words
sir
stephen
threw
his
head
back
and
laughed
that
all
right
staff
he
said
it
been
a
pleasure
to
me
i
just
wanted
to
see
you
happy
you
is
rather
inappropriate
though
is
it
considering
how
very
little
i
have
seen
you
but
there
were
reasons
we
wo
go
into
that
where
was
i
you
were
telling
us
your
reasons
for
building
this
place
sir
howard
reminded
him
quietly
sir
stephen
shot
a
glance
at
him
a
cautious
glance
was
i
by
george
then
i
am
more
communicative
than
usual
my
friends
in
the
city
and
elsewhere
would
tell
you
that
i
never
give
any
reasons
but
what
i
was
saying
was
this
that
i
learnt
that
the
world
likes
tinsel
and
glitter
just
as
the
sioux
indians
are
caught
by
glass
beads
and
lengths
of
turkey
red
calico
and
i
give
the
world
what
it
wants
see
he
laughed
a
laugh
which
was
as
cynical
as
howard
the
world
is
not
so
much
an
oyster
which
you
got
to
open
with
a
sword
as
the
old
proverb
has
it
but
a
wild
beast
yes
a
wild
beast
and
you
got
to
fight
him
at
first
fight
him
tooth
and
claw
when
you
beaten
him
ah
then
you
got
to
feed
him
you
have
beaten
your
wild
beast
sir
stephen
remarked
howard
well
yes
more
or
less
anyhow
he
seemed
ready
to
come
to
my
hand
for
the
i
can
give
him
the
world
likes
to
be
likes
good
dinners
and
balls
but
above
all
it
likes
to
be
amused
i
going
to
give
it
what
it
wants
stafford
looked
up
this
declaration
coming
from
his
father
jarred
upon
stafford
whose
heart
he
had
won
why
should
you
trouble
sir
he
said
quietly
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
been
satisfied
because
i
want
something
more
from
it
something
in
return
said
sir
stephen
with
a
smile
satisfied
no
man
is
satisfied
i
an
ambition
yet
ungratified
and
i
mean
to
gratify
it
you
think
vaunting
mr
howard
no
i
think
you
are
simply
stating
a
fact
responded
howard
gravely
i
thank
you
sir
said
sir
stephen
as
gravely
i
speak
so
confidently
because
i
see
my
way
clearly
before
me
i
generally
do
when
i
do
i
back
out
and
lie
low
stafford
found
this
too
painful
he
rose
to
get
a
light
and
sauntered
into
the
and
tried
the
table
sir
stephen
looked
after
him
musingly
and
seemed
to
forget
presence
then
suddenly
his
face
flushed
and
his
eyes
shone
with
a
curious
mixture
of
pride
and
tenderness
and
the
indomitable
resolution
which
had
helped
him
to
fight
his
wild
beast
he
leant
forward
and
touched
howard
knee
do
you
understand
he
said
earnestly
and
in
a
low
voice
which
the
click
of
the
billiard
balls
prevented
stafford
from
hearing
it
is
for
him
for
my
boy
howard
it
for
him
that
i
have
been
working
am
still
working
for
myself
i
am
satisfied
as
he
said
but
not
for
him
i
want
to
see
him
still
higher
up
the
ladder
than
i
have
climbed
i
have
done
fairly
well
heaven
and
earth
if
anyone
had
told
me
twenty
years
ago
that
i
should
be
where
and
what
i
am
well
i
have
sold
my
chances
for
a
bottle
of
ale
you
smile
howard
it
was
anything
but
beer
and
skittles
for
me
then
i
want
to
leave
my
boy
a
title
smile
again
howard
i
do
mind
i
have
a
smile
about
me
sir
said
howard
ah
you
understand
you
see
my
mind
i
do
know
why
i
told
you
excepting
that
it
is
because
you
are
staff
friend
but
i
told
you
now
and
am
i
not
right
is
it
a
laudable
ambition
can
you
say
that
he
will
not
wear
it
well
however
high
the
title
may
be
where
is
there
such
another
young
fellow
proud
pride
is
too
poor
a
word
for
what
i
feel
for
him
he
paused
and
sank
back
but
leant
forward
again
though
i
kept
apart
from
him
howard
i
have
watched
him
but
in
no
unworthy
sense
no
i
have
spied
upon
him
there
was
no
need
sir
said
howard
very
quietly
i
know
it
stafford
is
as
straight
as
a
dart
as
true
as
steel
oh
i
heard
of
him
i
know
there
is
a
more
popular
man
in
england
forgive
me
if
i
say
i
do
think
there
a
handsomer
howard
nodded
prompt
assent
i
read
of
him
in
society
at
hurlingham
everywhere
he
goes
he
holds
his
own
and
i
know
why
do
you
believe
in
birth
mr
howard
he
asked
abruptly
of
course
replied
howard
so
do
i
though
i
ca
lay
claim
to
any
but
there
a
good
strain
in
stafford
and
it
shows
itself
there
something
in
his
face
a
certain
look
in
his
eyes
in
his
voice
and
the
way
he
moves
that
quiet
yet
frank
manner
oh
i
ca
explain
he
broke
off
impatiently
i
think
you
have
done
it
very
well
said
howard
i
do
like
the
word
it
is
so
often
misapplied
but
i
ca
think
of
any
better
distinguished
is
the
word
that
describes
stafford
sir
stephen
nodded
eagerly
you
are
right
some
men
are
made
born
to
wear
the
purple
my
boy
is
one
of
them
and
he
shall
he
shall
take
his
place
amongst
the
noblest
and
the
best
in
the
land
he
shall
marry
with
the
highest
nature
has
cast
him
in
a
noble
mould
and
he
shall
step
into
his
proper
place
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
his
brilliant
eyes
flashed
as
if
he
were
looking
into
the
future
looking
into
the
hour
of
triumph
yes
i
agree
with
you
said
howard
but
i
am
afraid
stafford
will
scarcely
share
your
ambition
he
was
sorry
he
had
spoken
as
he
saw
the
change
which
his
words
had
caused
in
sir
stephen
what
he
said
almost
fiercely
why
do
you
say
that
why
should
he
not
be
ambitious
he
stopped
and
laid
his
hand
on
howard
shoulder
gripping
it
tightly
and
his
voice
sank
to
a
stern
whisper
you
know
of
anything
there
is
no
woman
no
entanglement
no
no
said
howard
make
your
mind
easy
on
that
point
there
is
no
one
stafford
is
singularly
free
in
that
respect
in
fact
well
he
is
rather
cold
there
is
no
one
i
am
sure
i
should
have
known
it
if
there
had
been
sir
stephen
grip
relaxed
and
the
stern
almost
savage
expression
was
smoothed
out
by
a
smile
right
he
said
still
in
a
whisper
then
there
is
no
obstacle
in
my
way
i
shall
win
what
i
am
fighting
for
though
it
will
not
be
an
easy
fight
no
sir
but
easy
or
difficult
i
mean
winning
he
rose
and
stood
erect
a
striking
figure
looking
over
howard
head
with
an
abstracted
gaze
then
suddenly
his
eyelids
quivered
his
face
grew
deathly
pale
and
his
hand
went
to
his
heart
howard
sprang
to
his
feet
with
an
exclamation
of
alarm
but
sir
stephen
held
up
his
hand
warningly
moved
slowly
to
one
of
the
tables
poured
out
a
glass
of
and
drank
it
then
he
turned
to
howard
who
stood
watching
him
uncertain
what
to
do
or
say
and
said
with
an
air
of
command
not
a
word
it
is
nothing
then
he
linked
his
arm
in
howard
and
led
him
into
the
table
all
right
stafford
sir
replied
stafford
you
and
howard
play
a
hundred
no
no
said
sir
stephen
you
and
howard
i
should
enjoy
looking
on
we
have
a
pool
said
stafford
taking
the
balls
from
the
cabinet
howard
watched
sir
stephen
as
he
played
his
first
shot
his
hand
was
perfectly
steady
and
he
soon
showed
that
he
was
a
player
that
was
a
good
shot
said
stafford
with
a
touch
of
pride
in
his
voice
i
do
know
that
i
seen
a
better
you
play
a
good
game
sir
sir
stephen
face
flushed
at
his
son
praise
as
a
girl
might
have
done
but
he
laughed
it
off
only
so
so
staff
i
do
play
half
as
good
a
game
as
you
and
howard
how
should
i
mr
howard
there
is
the
help
yourself
servants
are
a
nuisance
in
a
not
once
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
did
he
show
any
sign
of
the
weakness
which
had
so
startled
howard
and
as
they
went
up
the
stairs
he
told
them
a
story
with
admirable
verve
and
with
evident
enjoyment
sorry
our
evening
has
come
to
an
end
he
said
as
they
stood
outside
his
door
it
is
the
last
we
shall
have
to
ourselves
pity
but
it
ca
be
helped
unconsciously
he
opened
the
door
as
he
spoke
and
stafford
said
is
this
your
room
sir
yes
walk
in
my
boy
replied
sir
stephen
stafford
walked
in
and
stood
with
amazement
the
room
was
as
plainly
furnished
as
a
servant
more
plainly
probably
than
the
servants
who
were
housed
under
his
roof
saving
for
a
square
of
carpet
by
the
bed
and
the
floor
was
bare
the
bed
was
a
common
one
of
iron
narrow
and
without
drapery
the
furniture
was
of
painted
deal
the
only
picture
was
a
portrait
of
stafford
enlarged
from
a
photograph
and
it
hung
over
the
so
that
sir
stephen
could
see
it
from
the
bed
of
course
neither
stafford
nor
howard
made
any
remark
remember
that
portrait
stafford
asked
sir
stephen
with
a
smile
i
carry
it
about
with
me
wherever
i
go
foolish
and
fond
old
father
eh
howard
it
a
good
portrait
do
you
think
stafford
held
out
his
hand
sir
he
said
in
a
very
low
voice
my
boy
sure
you
got
everything
you
want
and
you
howard
do
let
me
disturb
you
in
the
morning
i
got
a
stupid
habit
of
getting
up
early
got
it
years
ago
and
it
clings
like
other
habits
hope
you
sleep
well
if
you
do
change
your
rooms
before
the
crowd
comes
did
you
see
the
room
asked
stafford
huskily
when
he
and
howard
had
got
into
stafford
howard
nodded
i
feel
as
if
i
could
pitch
all
this
stafford
looked
at
the
surrounding
luxuries
out
of
the
window
i
do
understand
him
great
heaven
he
makes
me
feel
the
most
selfish
pampered
wretch
on
the
face
of
the
earth
he
he
he
is
a
man
said
howard
with
an
earnestness
which
was
strange
in
him
you
are
right
said
stafford
there
never
was
such
a
father
and
yet
yet
i
do
understand
him
he
is
such
a
mixture
how
such
a
man
could
talk
as
he
did
no
i
do
understand
it
i
do
said
howard
but
then
sir
stephen
had
given
him
the
key
to
the
enigma
chapter
vii
stafford
slept
well
and
was
awake
before
measom
came
to
call
him
it
was
a
warm
and
lovely
morning
and
stafford
first
thoughts
flew
to
a
bath
he
got
into
flannels
and
found
his
way
to
the
lake
and
as
he
expected
there
was
an
elaborate
and
picturesque
beside
the
in
which
were
an
electric
launch
and
boats
of
all
descriptions
there
also
was
a
boatman
in
attendance
with
huge
towels
on
his
arm
did
you
expect
me
asked
stafford
as
the
man
touched
his
hat
and
opened
the
yes
sir
sir
stephen
sent
down
last
night
to
say
that
you
might
come
down
stafford
nodded
his
father
forgot
nothing
the
boatman
rowed
him
out
into
the
lake
and
stafford
had
a
delightful
swim
it
reminded
him
of
geneva
for
the
lake
this
morning
was
almost
as
clear
and
as
vivid
in
colouring
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
the
boatman
who
watched
his
young
master
admiringly
for
stafford
was
like
a
fish
in
the
water
informed
him
that
the
launch
would
be
ready
in
a
moment
notice
or
the
sailing
boat
either
for
the
matter
of
that
if
he
should
require
them
i
another
launch
a
steamer
and
larger
than
this
coming
and
sir
stephen
told
me
to
get
some
canadian
canoes
in
case
you
or
any
of
the
company
that
coming
should
fancy
them
sir
as
stafford
went
up
to
the
house
in
the
exquisite
frame
of
mind
he
met
his
father
the
expression
of
sir
stephen
face
which
a
moment
earlier
before
he
had
turned
the
corner
of
the
winding
path
had
been
grave
and
keen
and
somewhat
hard
softened
and
his
eyes
lit
up
with
a
smile
which
had
no
little
of
the
boatman
admiration
in
it
had
a
swim
my
boy
found
everything
right
i
hope
i
was
just
going
down
to
see
yes
everything
replied
stafford
i
ca
think
how
you
have
managed
to
get
it
done
in
so
short
a
time
he
added
looking
round
at
the
shrubs
the
smooth
paths
and
the
lawns
which
all
looked
as
if
they
had
been
in
cultivation
for
years
sir
stephen
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
is
all
a
question
of
money
and
the
right
men
he
said
i
always
work
on
the
plan
and
ask
the
questions
soon
how
much
then
i
add
ten
per
cent
to
the
contract
price
on
condition
that
the
time
is
kept
i
find
penalties
are
no
use
it
breaks
the
back
but
the
extra
ten
per
cent
makes
them
hustle
as
they
say
on
the
side
have
you
seen
the
stables
yet
but
of
course
you
have
or
i
should
have
seen
you
there
i
go
down
there
every
morning
not
because
i
understand
much
about
horses
but
because
i
fond
of
them
that
will
be
your
department
my
dear
stafford
at
each
turn
of
their
way
stafford
found
something
to
admire
and
his
wonderment
at
the
settled
and
established
oh
i
stipulated
that
there
should
be
any
newness
any
of
paint
so
to
speak
here
are
the
stables
i
had
them
put
as
far
from
the
house
as
possible
and
yet
most
men
like
to
stroll
about
them
i
hope
you
like
them
pawson
the
trainer
designed
them
stafford
nodded
with
warm
approval
they
seem
perfect
he
said
as
after
surveying
the
exterior
he
entered
and
looked
down
the
long
reach
of
stalls
and
loose
boxes
many
of
which
were
occupied
as
he
saw
at
a
glance
by
valuable
animals
they
are
a
fine
lot
sir
he
said
gravely
as
he
went
down
the
long
line
a
remarkably
fine
lot
i
have
never
seen
a
better
show
this
fellow
why
is
he
lord
winstay
bay
adonis
yes
said
sir
stephen
i
thought
you
like
him
good
heavens
exclaimed
stafford
you
do
mean
that
you
have
bought
him
for
me
sir
i
know
that
winstay
refused
eight
hundred
guineas
for
him
i
daresay
replied
sir
stephen
why
should
i
buy
him
for
you
my
boy
there
another
one
in
the
box
next
that
one
a
little
stiffer
i
told
he
up
to
your
weight
and
stafford
went
into
the
box
and
looked
at
the
horse
it
was
a
magnificent
hunter
the
kind
of
horse
that
makes
a
heart
jump
i
should
say
that
there
are
not
two
better
horses
of
their
sort
in
the
county
stafford
said
solemnly
and
with
a
flush
of
his
handsome
face
sir
stephen
eyes
gleamed
that
all
right
they
ca
be
too
good
stafford
the
head
groom
davis
by
name
stood
with
pottinger
and
some
underlings
at
a
little
distance
in
attendance
and
the
men
exchanged
glances
and
nods
have
you
seen
these
pottinger
asked
stafford
turning
to
him
and
speaking
in
the
tone
which
servants
love
pottinger
touched
his
forehead
yes
sir
they
first
rate
and
no
mistake
i
just
been
telling
davis
he
got
a
splendid
lot
sir
splendid
not
but
what
your
own
pair
be
hard
to
beat
sir
said
davis
respectfully
there
a
mare
here
sir
stephen
i
should
like
to
show
mr
stafford
the
mare
was
taken
out
into
the
yard
and
stafford
examined
her
and
praised
her
with
a
judgment
and
enthusiasm
which
filled
davis
heart
with
pride
your
young
the
right
sort
pottinger
he
remarked
as
stafford
at
last
reluctantly
tore
himself
away
from
the
stables
give
me
a
master
as
understands
a
horse
and
i
do
mind
working
for
him
pottinger
nodded
and
turned
the
straw
in
his
mouth
if
you
alludin
to
stafford
then
you
enjoy
your
work
davis
for
you
got
what
you
want
what
my
do
know
about
a
is
worth
knowing
so
i
should
say
assented
davis
emphatically
i
do
hate
to
have
a
juggins
about
the
place
barker
that
a
spot
o
rust
on
that
or
is
my
eyesight
deceiving
me
no
my
men
if
the
slightest
thing
askew
when
stafford
walks
round
i
shall
break
my
heart
and
sack
the
man
who
responsible
for
it
pottinger
if
you
like
that
pair
o
yours
moved
if
you
think
they
comfortable
you
say
so
and
moved
they
shall
be
as
sir
stephen
and
stafford
strolled
back
to
the
house
the
former
paused
now
and
again
to
point
out
something
he
wished
stafford
to
see
always
appealing
for
his
approval
everything
is
perfect
sir
stafford
said
at
last
and
above
all
the
situation
he
added
as
he
looked
at
the
magnificent
view
the
opal
lake
mirroring
the
distant
mountains
flecked
by
the
sunlight
and
the
drifting
clouds
yes
i
was
fortunate
in
getting
it
remarked
sir
stephen
instantly
there
flashed
across
stafford
mind
and
not
for
the
first
time
that
morning
the
words
ida
heron
had
spoken
respecting
the
way
in
which
sir
stephen
had
obtained
the
land
looking
straight
before
him
he
asked
how
did
you
get
it
sir
i
have
heard
that
it
was
difficult
to
buy
land
here
for
building
purposes
yes
i
fancy
it
is
replied
sir
stephen
quite
easily
now
you
speak
of
it
i
remember
my
agent
said
there
was
some
hitch
at
first
but
he
must
have
got
over
it
in
some
way
or
other
he
bought
it
of
a
farmer
stafford
drew
a
breath
of
relief
this
is
the
italian
garden
the
tennis
and
croquet
lawns
are
below
this
terrace
there
not
time
to
go
down
but
you
have
seen
half
of
it
yet
there
the
do
trouble
to
change
i
like
you
in
those
flannels
he
laid
his
hand
on
stafford
broad
straight
shoulder
you
have
the
knack
of
wearing
your
clothes
as
if
they
grew
on
you
staff
stafford
laughed
i
ought
to
hand
that
compliment
on
to
measom
sir
he
said
he
the
responsible
person
and
deserves
the
credit
if
there
is
any
he
looked
at
his
father
upright
and
graceful
figure
but
he
would
hand
it
back
to
you
i
think
sir
there
was
a
pause
then
stafford
said
do
you
know
any
of
your
neighbours
any
of
the
people
round
about
no
i
was
never
here
until
yesterday
excepting
for
an
hour
or
two
but
we
shall
know
them
i
suppose
they
call
in
a
little
while
and
we
will
ask
them
to
dinner
and
so
on
there
should
be
some
nice
people
ah
howard
we
stolen
a
march
on
you
i
not
surprised
sir
said
howard
as
he
came
up
in
his
slow
and
languid
way
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
stafford
has
an
extremely
bad
habit
of
getting
up
at
unreasonable
hours
i
wait
until
i
am
dragged
out
of
bed
by
a
or
the
pangs
of
hunger
of
course
you
have
been
bathing
staff
early
rising
and
an
inordinate
love
of
cold
water
externally
at
all
seasons
are
two
of
his
ineradicable
vices
sir
stephen
i
have
done
my
best
to
cure
them
but
alas
they
went
in
to
breakfast
which
was
served
in
a
room
with
bay
windows
opening
on
to
the
terrace
overlooking
the
lake
exactly
opposite
stafford
chair
was
the
little
opening
on
the
other
side
from
which
he
and
the
girl
from
heron
hall
had
gazed
at
the
villa
he
looked
at
it
and
grew
silent
a
large
stood
beside
sir
stephen
plate
he
did
not
open
it
but
sent
it
to
his
room
i
never
read
my
letters
before
breakfast
he
remarked
they
spoil
one
digestion
i
afraid
the
mail
heavy
this
morning
judging
by
the
weight
of
the
box
so
that
i
shall
be
busy
you
two
gentlemen
will
i
trust
amuse
yourselves
in
your
own
way
howard
the
groom
will
await
your
orders
thanks
said
howard
but
i
propose
to
sit
quite
still
on
a
chair
which
i
have
carried
out
on
to
the
terrace
i
have
had
enough
of
driving
to
last
me
for
a
week
and
he
shuddered
stafford
laughed
howard
easily
disposed
of
sir
he
said
give
him
a
hammock
or
an
in
the
shade
and
he
can
always
amuse
himself
by
going
to
sleep
true
and
if
half
the
men
i
know
spent
their
time
in
a
similar
fashion
this
would
be
a
brighter
and
a
better
world
what
you
will
do
my
dear
stafford
i
know
by
bitter
experience
he
will
go
and
wade
through
a
river
or
ride
at
a
pace
down
some
of
those
hills
stafford
is
never
happy
unless
he
is
trying
to
lay
up
rheumatism
for
his
old
age
or
endeavouring
to
break
his
limbs
sir
stephen
looked
across
the
table
at
the
stalwart
graceful
frame
but
he
said
nothing
there
was
no
need
for
his
eyes
were
eloquent
of
love
and
admiration
stafford
changed
into
riding
things
soon
after
breakfast
went
down
to
the
stables
and
had
adonis
saddled
davis
superintended
the
operation
and
the
stablemen
edged
round
to
watch
davis
expressed
his
approval
as
stafford
mounted
and
went
off
on
a
splendid
creature
remarking
as
he
started
beautiful
mouth
davis
yes
pottinger
said
davis
succinctly
he
worthy
of
him
what
i
call
now
dash
my
aunt
if
you
find
it
easy
to
match
the
pair
of
there
a
class
about
both
that
you
do
often
see
if
you
step
inside
my
little
place
pottinger
we
drink
your
health
i
like
his
shape
i
like
his
style
and
i
counted
a
bit
of
a
judge
he
a
gentleman
and
a
at
that
stafford
rode
down
the
winding
drive
at
which
the
gardeners
were
at
work
on
borders
and
shrubberies
and
on
to
the
road
the
air
was
like
champagne
the
slight
breeze
just
ruffled
the
lake
on
which
the
sun
was
glittering
stafford
was
conscious
of
a
strange
feeling
of
eagerness
of
quickly
thrilling
vitality
which
was
new
to
him
he
put
it
down
to
the
glorious
morning
to
the
discovery
of
the
affection
of
his
father
to
the
good
horse
that
stepped
as
lightly
as
an
arab
and
carried
him
as
if
he
were
a
feather
and
yet
all
the
while
he
knew
that
these
did
not
altogether
account
for
the
electric
eagerness
the
joy
of
living
which
possessed
him
he
pulled
up
for
a
moment
at
the
woodman
inn
to
thank
groves
for
the
port
and
that
gentleman
came
out
as
glad
to
see
him
as
if
he
were
an
old
friend
do
mention
it
sir
he
said
i
thought
a
long
time
before
i
sent
it
because
i
was
sure
that
sir
stephen
and
you
might
think
it
a
liberty
but
i
need
have
done
so
i
know
now
and
it
was
kind
of
sir
stephen
to
send
me
a
note
with
the
sherry
it
was
like
a
gentleman
if
you
excuse
me
saying
so
sir
stafford
rode
over
the
hill
and
along
the
road
by
the
stream
and
as
he
rode
he
looked
round
him
eagerly
and
keenly
in
fact
as
if
he
were
scouting
but
that
for
which
he
was
looking
so
intently
did
not
appear
his
spirits
fell
though
the
sun
was
still
shining
and
he
sighed
impatiently
and
putting
adonis
through
the
stream
cantered
over
the
moor
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
suddenly
he
heard
the
bark
of
a
dog
and
looking
eagerly
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
he
saw
ida
heron
walking
quickly
round
the
hill
with
donald
and
bess
scampering
in
front
of
her
the
gloom
vanished
from
stafford
face
and
he
checked
adonis
into
a
walk
the
dogs
were
the
first
to
see
him
and
they
tore
towards
him
barking
a
welcome
ida
looked
up
she
had
been
walking
with
her
eyes
bent
on
the
ground
the
colour
rose
to
her
face
and
she
stopped
for
an
instant
then
she
came
on
slowly
and
by
the
time
they
had
met
there
was
no
trace
of
the
transitory
blush
stafford
raised
his
hat
and
dismounted
and
tried
to
speak
in
a
casual
tone
but
it
was
difficult
to
conceal
the
subtle
delight
which
sprang
up
within
him
at
the
sight
of
her
and
he
looked
at
the
beautiful
face
and
the
slim
graceful
figure
in
its
gown
which
well
worn
as
it
was
seemed
to
him
to
sit
upon
her
as
no
other
dress
had
ever
sat
upon
any
other
woman
he
had
hard
work
to
keep
the
admiration
from
his
eyes
i
begin
to
count
myself
a
very
lucky
man
miss
heron
he
said
why
she
asked
her
grave
eyes
resting
on
him
calmly
because
i
have
chanced
to
meet
you
again
it
is
not
strange
she
said
i
am
nearly
always
what
a
beautiful
horse
is
it
he
said
grateful
for
her
praise
it
is
a
new
one
a
present
from
my
father
this
morning
a
very
valuable
present
it
ought
to
be
able
to
jump
it
is
i
put
it
at
a
bank
just
now
and
it
cleared
it
like
a
bird
i
am
very
glad
i
have
met
you
i
wanted
to
tell
you
something
she
raised
her
eyes
from
the
horse
and
waited
with
the
quietude
the
and
dignity
which
seemed
so
strange
in
one
so
young
and
which
by
its
strangeness
fascinated
him
i
spoke
to
my
father
about
the
land
he
is
innocent
in
the
matter
it
was
bought
through
his
agent
and
my
father
knows
nothing
of
anything
underhand
i
ca
tell
you
how
glad
i
am
that
this
is
so
so
glad
that
i
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
i
rode
over
this
morning
in
the
hope
of
meeting
you
and
telling
you
she
made
a
little
gesture
of
acceptance
i
am
glad
too
though
it
does
not
matter
ah
but
it
does
he
broke
in
i
should
have
been
wretched
if
you
had
been
right
and
my
father
had
been
guilty
of
anything
of
the
kind
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
is
capable
of
it
as
you
say
if
you
knew
him
now
there
no
reason
why
we
should
be
friends
is
there
he
added
with
a
suppressed
eagerness
oh
no
she
responded
she
glanced
up
at
the
sky
unnoticed
by
him
a
cloud
had
drifted
over
the
langdale
pikes
as
the
range
of
high
mountain
is
called
it
is
going
to
rain
and
heavily
and
you
have
no
umbrella
waterproof
exclaimed
stafford
she
laughed
with
girlish
amusement
umbrella
i
do
think
i
have
such
a
thing
and
this
cloth
is
nearly
waterproof
besides
i
never
notice
the
rain
here
it
comes
it
came
with
a
vengeance
it
was
as
if
the
heavens
had
opened
and
let
down
the
bottom
of
a
reservoir
stafford
mechanically
took
off
his
coat
put
this
on
he
said
that
jacket
is
quite
light
you
get
wet
through
her
face
crimsoned
and
she
laughed
a
little
constrainedly
please
put
your
coat
on
she
said
gravely
and
earnestly
will
be
wet
through
and
you
are
not
used
to
it
there
is
a
shed
round
the
corner
ride
there
as
quickly
as
you
can
stafford
stared
at
her
then
burst
into
a
laugh
which
echoed
hers
and
leave
you
here
is
it
likely
well
let
us
both
go
she
said
as
if
amused
by
his
obstinacy
is
it
far
he
asked
see
if
you
can
manage
to
balance
on
the
saddle
i
would
run
beside
you
it
all
very
well
to
talk
of
not
minding
the
rain
but
this
is
a
deluge
she
glanced
at
the
horse
i
could
get
up
i
could
if
he
were
barebacked
or
if
it
were
a
lady
saddle
it
does
matter
look
donald
and
bess
are
laughing
at
you
for
making
a
fuss
about
a
shower
will
you
try
let
me
help
you
he
pleaded
i
could
lift
you
quite
easily
oh
forgive
me
but
i
not
used
to
standing
by
and
seeing
a
girl
get
soaked
you
are
walking
not
standing
she
reminded
him
solemnly
perhaps
her
smile
gave
him
courage
he
took
her
just
below
the
shoulders
and
lifted
her
on
to
the
saddle
saying
as
he
did
so
and
in
as
a
voice
as
he
could
if
you
just
put
your
hand
on
my
shoulder
you
find
that
you
can
ride
quite
safely
though
i
expect
you
could
do
it
without
that
seen
you
ride
you
know
he
kept
his
eyes
from
her
so
that
he
did
not
see
the
hot
blush
which
mantled
in
the
clear
ivory
of
her
face
or
the
sudden
tightening
of
the
lips
as
if
she
were
struggling
against
some
feeling
and
fighting
for
her
usual
she
succeeded
in
a
moment
or
two
and
when
he
looked
up
the
blush
had
gone
and
something
like
amusement
was
sharing
the
sweet
girlish
confusion
in
her
grey
eyes
this
is
absurd
she
said
it
is
to
be
hoped
jason
or
none
of
the
men
will
see
me
they
would
think
i
had
gone
mad
and
i
should
never
hear
the
last
of
it
the
shed
is
by
that
tree
i
see
it
just
across
the
road
please
keep
a
tight
hold
of
my
shoulder
i
should
never
forgive
myself
if
you
slipped
i
am
not
in
the
least
likely
to
slip
she
said
then
suddenly
just
as
they
were
on
the
edge
of
the
road
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
rather
than
embarrassment
for
a
carriage
and
pair
came
round
the
corner
and
almost
upon
them
stafford
stopped
adonis
to
let
the
carriage
pass
but
the
coachman
pulled
up
in
response
to
a
signal
from
someone
inside
and
a
man
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
regarded
them
at
first
with
surprise
and
then
with
keen
scrutiny
he
was
an
elderly
man
with
a
face
which
would
have
been
coarse
but
for
its
expression
of
acuteness
and
a
certain
strength
which
revealed
itself
in
the
heavy
features
can
you
tell
me
the
way
to
sir
stephen
orme
place
he
asked
in
a
rough
harsh
voice
ida
was
about
to
slip
down
but
she
reflected
that
the
mischief
if
there
were
any
was
done
now
and
to
stafford
admiration
she
sat
quite
still
under
the
gaze
of
the
man
keen
sarcastic
eyes
yes
keep
straight
on
and
round
by
the
woodman
you
will
see
the
house
by
that
time
said
stafford
thanks
drive
on
coachman
said
the
man
and
he
drew
in
his
head
with
a
grim
smile
and
something
like
a
sneer
on
his
thick
lips
that
made
stafford
eyes
flash
chapter
viii
stafford
and
ida
remained
unconscious
of
the
rain
looking
after
the
carriage
for
a
moment
or
two
the
sneer
on
the
man
heavy
yet
acutely
sharp
face
still
incensed
stafford
he
had
the
usual
desire
of
the
strong
man
to
dash
after
the
rapidly
disappearing
vehicle
lug
the
fellow
out
and
ask
him
what
he
was
sneering
at
ida
was
the
first
to
speak
what
a
man
she
said
stafford
started
slightly
awaking
to
the
fact
that
it
was
still
pouring
i
i
beg
your
pardon
i
keeping
you
out
in
the
rain
he
put
adonis
not
at
all
unwillingly
to
a
trot
and
they
gained
the
rough
and
he
would
have
lifted
the
girl
down
but
she
was
too
quick
for
him
and
slipped
gracefully
and
easily
from
the
saddle
stafford
leading
the
horse
followed
her
into
the
shed
bess
sat
on
the
extreme
end
of
her
haunches
shivering
and
blinking
and
all
too
plainly
cursing
the
british
climate
but
donald
threw
himself
down
outside
as
if
he
regarded
the
deluge
as
a
cheap
stafford
looked
at
ida
anxiously
you
are
fearfully
wet
he
said
i
think
i
could
wipe
off
the
worst
of
it
if
you
let
me
he
took
out
his
pocket
handkerchief
as
he
spoke
and
wiped
the
rain
from
her
straight
beautifully
moulded
shoulders
she
drew
back
a
little
and
opened
her
lips
to
protest
at
first
but
with
a
slight
shrug
she
resigned
herself
her
eyes
downcast
a
faint
colour
in
her
face
i
must
be
quite
dry
now
she
said
at
last
i
afraid
not
said
stafford
i
wish
i
had
something
bigger
a
towel
she
laughed
the
sweet
girlish
laugh
which
seemed
to
him
the
most
musical
sound
he
had
ever
heard
a
towel
fancying
carrying
a
towel
to
wipe
oneself
with
when
it
rained
it
is
evident
you
do
know
our
country
there
are
weeks
sometimes
in
which
it
never
ceases
to
rain
and
you
must
be
wet
through
yourself
she
added
glancing
at
him
he
was
on
his
knees
at
the
moment
carefully
wiping
the
old
habit
skirt
with
his
saturated
handkerchief
as
if
the
former
were
something
precious
and
her
woman
eye
noted
his
short
crisp
hair
the
shapely
head
and
the
straight
broad
back
i
afraid
that
all
i
can
do
he
said
regretfully
as
he
rose
and
looked
at
her
gravely
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
habitually
ride
out
in
such
weather
as
this
why
yes
she
replied
lightly
why
not
i
am
too
substantial
to
melt
and
i
never
catch
cold
besides
i
have
to
go
out
in
all
weathers
to
see
to
the
cattle
and
the
sheep
he
leant
against
one
of
the
posts
which
supported
the
shed
and
gazed
at
her
with
more
intense
interest
than
any
other
woman
had
ever
aroused
in
him
is
there
a
foreman
a
bailiff
whatever
you
call
him
in
these
parts
she
shook
her
head
no
we
can
not
afford
one
so
i
do
his
work
and
very
pleasant
work
it
is
especially
in
fine
weather
and
you
are
happy
he
asked
almost
unconsciously
her
frank
eyes
met
his
with
a
smile
of
amusement
yes
quite
happy
she
answered
why
does
it
seem
so
unlikely
so
unreasonable
well
it
does
he
replied
as
if
her
frankness
were
contagious
of
course
i
could
understand
it
if
you
did
it
occasionally
if
you
did
it
because
you
liked
riding
but
to
be
obliged
to
have
to
go
out
in
all
weathers
it
is
right
she
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
yes
i
suppose
it
seems
strange
to
you
i
suppose
most
of
the
ladies
you
know
are
rich
and
only
ride
to
amuse
themselves
and
never
go
out
when
they
do
not
want
to
do
so
sir
stephen
orme
you
are
very
rich
are
you
not
we
my
father
and
i
are
poor
very
poor
and
if
i
did
not
look
after
things
if
i
were
not
my
own
bailiff
oh
well
i
do
know
what
would
happen
stafford
gnawed
at
his
moustache
as
he
gazed
at
her
the
exquisitely
colourless
face
in
which
the
violet
eyes
glowed
like
two
twin
flowers
the
delicately
cut
lips
soft
and
red
the
dark
hair
clustering
at
the
ivory
temples
in
wet
rings
set
his
heart
beating
with
a
heavy
pulsation
that
was
an
agony
of
admiration
and
longing
a
longing
that
was
vague
and
indistinct
yes
i
suppose
it
must
seem
strange
to
you
she
said
as
if
she
were
following
out
the
lines
of
her
own
thoughts
you
must
be
accustomed
to
girls
who
are
so
different
yes
they
different
he
admitted
most
of
the
women
i
know
would
be
frightened
to
death
if
they
were
caught
in
such
a
rain
as
this
would
be
more
than
frightened
to
death
if
they
had
to
ride
down
that
hill
most
of
think
they
done
wonder
if
they
get
in
at
the
end
of
a
run
over
a
fairly
easy
country
and
none
of
could
doctor
a
sick
sheep
to
save
their
lives
yes
she
said
dreamily
i
seen
them
but
only
at
a
distance
but
i
did
know
anything
about
farming
until
i
came
home
and
do
you
never
go
away
from
here
go
to
london
for
a
change
and
get
a
dance
and
and
all
that
he
asked
she
shook
her
head
indifferently
no
i
never
leave
the
dale
i
can
not
my
father
could
not
spare
me
has
it
left
off
raining
yet
she
went
to
the
front
of
the
shed
and
looked
out
no
it
is
still
pelting
please
come
back
it
is
pouring
off
the
roof
your
hair
is
quite
wet
again
she
laughed
but
she
obeyed
i
suppose
that
gentleman
the
man
in
the
carriage
was
a
friend
of
sir
stephen
as
he
asked
the
way
to
your
house
i
do
know
replied
stafford
i
do
know
any
of
my
friends
i
knew
very
little
of
him
until
last
night
she
looked
at
him
with
frank
girlish
interest
did
you
find
the
new
house
very
beautiful
she
asked
stafford
nodded
yes
he
said
absently
it
is
a
kind
of
of
palace
it
beautiful
enough
perhaps
a
little
too
too
rich
he
admitted
she
smiled
but
then
you
are
rich
and
is
it
true
that
a
number
of
visitors
are
coming
down
i
heard
it
from
jessie
who
is
jessie
he
asked
for
he
was
more
interested
in
the
smallest
detail
of
this
strange
bewilderingly
lovely
girl
life
than
his
father
affairs
jessie
is
my
maid
i
call
her
mine
because
she
is
very
much
attached
to
me
but
she
is
really
our
we
have
very
few
servants
i
suppose
you
have
a
great
many
up
at
the
new
house
he
nodded
oh
yes
he
said
half
apologetically
too
many
by
far
i
wish
you
could
see
it
he
added
she
laughed
softly
thank
you
but
that
is
not
likely
i
think
it
is
not
raining
so
hard
now
and
that
i
can
go
it
is
simply
pouring
still
he
said
earnestly
and
emphatically
you
would
get
drenched
if
you
ventured
out
but
i
ca
stay
here
all
day
she
remarked
with
a
laugh
i
have
a
great
deal
to
do
i
have
to
see
that
the
sheep
have
not
strayed
and
that
the
cows
are
in
the
meadows
the
fences
are
bad
in
places
and
the
stupid
creatures
are
always
straying
it
is
wonderful
how
quickly
a
cow
finds
a
weak
place
in
a
fence
stafford
face
grew
red
a
red
it
not
fit
work
for
you
he
said
you
you
are
only
a
girl
you
ca
be
strong
enough
to
face
such
weather
to
do
such
work
the
beautiful
eyes
grew
wide
and
gazed
at
him
with
girlish
amusement
and
something
of
indignation
i
older
than
you
think
i
not
a
girl
she
retorted
and
i
am
as
strong
as
a
horse
she
drew
herself
up
and
threw
her
head
back
i
am
never
tired
or
scarcely
ever
one
day
i
rode
to
keswick
and
back
and
when
i
got
home
jason
met
me
at
the
gate
and
told
me
that
the
steers
had
and
had
got
on
the
bryndermere
road
i
started
after
them
but
missed
them
for
a
time
and
only
came
up
with
them
at
landal
water
ah
you
do
know
where
that
is
well
it
is
a
great
many
miles
of
course
i
had
a
rest
coming
back
as
i
could
only
drive
them
slowly
something
in
his
eyes
the
pity
the
indignation
the
wonder
that
this
exquisitely
refined
specimen
of
maidenhood
should
be
bent
to
such
base
uses
shone
in
them
and
stopped
her
the
colour
rose
to
her
face
and
her
eyes
grew
faintly
troubled
then
a
proud
light
flashed
in
them
ah
i
see
you
are
thinking
that
it
is
is
not
ladylike
that
none
of
your
would
do
it
if
even
if
they
were
strong
enough
stafford
would
have
scorned
himself
if
he
had
been
tempted
to
evade
those
beautiful
eyes
that
sweet
and
now
rather
haughty
voice
besides
he
was
not
given
to
evasion
with
man
or
woman
i
was
thinking
quite
that
he
said
but
i
tell
you
what
i
was
thinking
if
you
promise
not
to
be
offended
she
considered
for
a
moment
then
she
said
i
do
not
think
you
will
offend
me
what
was
it
well
i
was
thinking
that
see
here
now
miss
heron
i
got
your
promise
it
is
not
worthy
of
you
such
work
i
mean
because
i
a
girl
she
said
her
lip
curving
with
a
smile
no
he
said
gravely
because
you
are
a
lady
because
you
are
so
so
refined
so
graceful
so
he
dared
not
say
beautiful
and
consequently
he
floundered
and
broke
down
if
you
were
a
daughter
clumsy
and
rough
and
awkward
it
would
not
seem
to
inappropriate
for
you
to
be
herding
cattle
and
counting
sheep
but
now
your
promise
when
i
come
to
think
that
ever
since
i
met
you
whenever
i
think
of
you
i
think
of
of
a
beautiful
flower
that
now
i
have
seen
you
in
i
realise
how
wrong
it
is
that
you
should
do
such
work
oh
dash
it
i
know
it
like
my
cheek
to
talk
to
you
like
this
he
wound
up
abruptly
and
desperately
while
he
had
been
speaking
the
effect
of
his
words
had
expressed
itself
in
her
eyes
and
in
the
alternating
colour
and
pallor
of
her
face
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
life
any
man
had
told
her
that
she
was
refined
and
graceful
and
that
she
was
so
to
speak
wasting
her
sweetness
on
the
desert
air
and
the
speech
was
both
pleasant
and
painful
to
her
the
long
dark
lashes
swept
her
cheek
her
lips
set
tightly
to
repress
the
quiver
which
threatened
them
but
when
he
had
completely
broken
down
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
with
a
look
so
grave
so
sweet
so
girlish
that
stafford
heart
leapt
not
for
the
first
time
that
morning
and
there
flashed
through
him
the
unexpected
thought
what
would
not
a
man
give
to
have
those
eyes
turned
upon
him
with
love
shining
in
their
depths
i
not
offended
she
said
i
know
what
you
mean
none
of
your
would
do
it
because
they
are
ladies
i
sorry
but
they
are
not
placed
as
i
am
do
you
think
i
could
sit
with
my
hands
before
me
or
do
while
things
went
to
ruin
my
father
is
old
and
feeble
you
saw
him
the
other
night
i
have
no
brother
no
one
to
help
me
and
so
you
see
how
it
is
the
eyes
rested
on
his
with
a
proud
smile
as
if
she
were
challenging
him
then
she
went
on
and
it
does
not
matter
i
live
quite
alone
i
see
no
one
no
other
lady
there
is
no
one
to
be
ashamed
of
me
stafford
reddened
that
rather
a
hard
hit
for
me
he
said
ashamed
by
heaven
if
you
knew
how
i
admired
how
amazed
i
am
at
your
pluck
and
goodness
her
eyes
dropped
before
his
glowing
ones
and
there
is
no
need
to
pity
me
i
am
quite
happy
quite
happier
than
i
should
be
if
i
were
playing
the
piano
or
paying
visits
all
day
it
has
quite
left
off
now
half
unconsciously
he
put
his
hand
on
her
arm
pleadingly
and
with
the
firm
masterful
touch
of
the
man
will
you
wait
one
more
moment
he
said
in
his
deep
musical
voice
she
paused
and
looked
at
him
enquiringly
you
said
just
now
that
you
had
no
brother
no
one
to
help
you
will
you
let
me
help
you
will
you
let
me
stand
in
the
place
of
a
friend
of
a
brother
she
looked
at
him
with
frank
surprise
and
most
men
would
have
been
embarrassed
and
confused
by
the
steady
astonished
regard
of
the
violet
eyes
but
stafford
was
too
eager
to
get
her
consent
to
care
for
the
amusement
that
was
mixed
with
the
expression
of
surprise
why
how
could
you
help
me
she
said
at
last
even
if
you
let
me
he
finished
for
her
well
i
not
particularly
clever
but
i
got
sense
enough
to
count
sheep
and
drive
cows
and
i
can
break
in
colts
train
dogs
and
if
i
obliged
i
daresay
i
could
drive
a
plough
her
eyes
wandered
thoughtfully
abstractedly
down
the
dale
but
she
was
listening
and
thinking
of
course
i
should
have
a
lot
to
learn
but
i
rather
quick
at
picking
up
things
and
are
you
joking
mr
orme
she
broke
in
joking
i
was
never
more
serious
in
my
life
he
said
eagerly
and
yet
with
an
attempt
to
conceal
his
earnestness
i
am
asking
it
as
a
favour
i
am
indeed
i
shall
be
here
for
weeks
months
perhaps
and
i
should
be
bored
to
death
with
your
father
house
full
of
visitors
she
put
in
softly
and
with
a
smile
breaking
through
her
gravity
oh
they
amuse
themselves
he
said
at
any
rate
i
be
with
them
all
day
and
i
ever
so
much
rather
help
you
than
dance
attendance
on
them
she
pushed
the
short
silky
curls
from
her
temples
and
shook
her
head
of
course
it
ridiculous
she
said
with
a
girlish
laugh
and
impossible
too
oh
is
it
he
retorted
i
never
yet
found
anything
i
wanted
to
do
impossible
you
always
have
your
own
way
she
asked
by
hook
or
by
crook
he
replied
but
why
do
you
want
to
help
me
she
asked
do
you
think
you
would
find
it
amusing
you
would
the
laughter
shone
in
her
eyes
again
you
would
soon
grow
tired
of
it
it
is
not
like
hunting
or
fishing
or
golfing
it
work
that
tries
the
temper
i
never
knew
what
a
fiendish
temper
i
had
got
about
me
until
the
first
time
i
had
to
drive
a
cow
and
calf
my
temper
could
be
worse
he
remarked
calmly
howard
says
that
sometimes
i
could
give
points
to
the
man
possessed
with
seven
devils
who
is
mr
howard
she
asked
my
own
particular
chum
he
said
he
came
down
with
me
and
is
up
at
the
house
now
but
never
mind
howard
are
you
going
to
let
me
help
you
as
if
i
were
an
old
friend
or
a
brother
or
are
you
going
to
be
unkind
enough
to
refuse
she
began
to
feel
driven
and
her
brows
knit
as
she
said
i
think
you
are
very
obstinate
mr
orme
that
describes
me
exactly
he
said
cheerfully
i
a
perfect
mule
when
i
like
and
i
liking
it
all
i
know
at
this
moment
it
absurd
it
ridiculous
as
i
said
she
murmured
half
angrily
half
laughingly
and
i
ca
think
why
you
offered
why
you
want
to
to
help
me
never
mind
said
stafford
his
heart
beating
with
anticipatory
triumph
for
he
knew
that
the
woman
who
hesitates
is
gained
perhaps
i
want
to
get
some
lessons
in
farming
on
the
cheap
or
perhaps
you
really
want
to
help
the
poor
girl
who
though
she
is
a
lady
has
to
do
the
work
of
a
farmer
daughter
she
said
in
a
low
voice
oh
it
is
very
kind
of
you
but
then
i
come
over
an
hour
earlier
than
this
and
you
shall
show
me
how
to
count
the
sheep
or
whatever
you
do
with
them
he
put
in
quickly
but
i
was
going
to
refuse
very
gratefully
of
course
but
to
refuse
you
could
you
could
be
so
unkind
i
ride
a
hunter
i
got
he
rather
stiffer
than
adonis
and
better
up
to
rough
work
i
will
come
to
the
stream
where
we
first
met
and
wait
for
you
shall
i
he
said
all
this
as
if
the
matter
were
settled
and
with
the
sensation
of
being
driven
still
more
strongly
upon
her
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
with
a
yielding
expression
in
them
with
that
touch
of
imploration
which
lurks
in
a
woman
eyes
and
about
the
corners
of
her
lips
when
for
the
first
time
she
surrenders
her
will
to
a
man
i
do
not
know
what
to
say
it
is
absurd
it
is
wrong
i
understand
why
ah
well
she
sighed
with
an
air
of
relief
you
will
tire
of
it
very
quickly
after
a
few
hours
all
right
we
leave
it
at
that
he
said
with
an
exasperating
air
of
cheerful
confidence
it
is
a
bargain
miss
heron
shall
we
shake
hands
on
it
he
held
out
his
hand
with
the
smile
which
few
men
and
still
fewer
women
could
resist
and
she
tried
to
smile
in
response
but
as
his
strong
hand
closed
over
her
small
one
a
faint
look
of
doubt
almost
of
trouble
was
palpable
in
her
violet
eyes
and
on
her
lips
she
drew
her
hand
away
and
it
had
to
be
drawn
for
he
released
it
only
slowly
and
reluctantly
and
without
a
word
she
left
the
shed
stafford
watched
her
as
she
went
lightly
and
quickly
up
the
road
towards
the
hall
bess
and
donald
leaping
round
her
then
with
a
sharp
feeling
of
elation
a
feeling
that
was
as
novel
as
it
was
confusing
he
sprang
on
his
horse
and
putting
him
to
a
gallop
rode
for
home
with
one
thought
standing
clearly
out
that
before
many
hours
the
next
morning
he
should
see
her
again
once
he
shifted
his
whip
to
his
left
hand
and
stretching
out
his
right
hand
looked
at
it
curiously
it
seemed
to
be
still
thrilling
with
the
contact
of
her
small
warm
palm
as
he
came
up
to
the
woodman
inn
he
remembered
what
he
had
forgotten
in
the
morning
that
he
had
left
his
on
the
he
pulled
up
and
giving
adonis
to
the
hostler
who
rushed
forward
promptly
he
went
into
the
inn
there
was
no
one
in
the
hall
and
knowing
that
he
should
be
late
for
luncheon
he
opened
the
door
and
walked
in
and
straight
up
to
the
fireplace
the
was
where
he
had
left
it
and
he
turned
to
go
out
then
he
saw
that
he
was
not
the
only
occupant
of
the
room
for
a
lady
was
sitting
in
the
broad
he
snatched
off
his
cap
and
murmured
an
apology
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
not
know
anyone
was
in
the
room
he
said
the
lady
was
young
and
handsome
with
a
beauty
which
owed
a
great
deal
to
colour
her
hair
was
a
rich
auburn
her
complexion
of
the
delicate
purity
which
sometimes
goes
with
that
coloured
hair
milk
and
roses
it
used
to
be
called
her
eyes
were
of
china
blue
and
her
lips
rather
full
but
of
the
richest
carmine
she
was
exquisitely
dressed
her
travelling
costume
evidently
of
redfern
build
and
one
hand
from
which
she
had
removed
the
glove
was
loaded
with
costly
rings
diamonds
and
emeralds
as
large
as
nuts
and
of
the
first
water
but
it
was
not
her
undeniable
beauty
or
her
dress
and
costly
jewellery
which
impressed
stafford
so
much
as
the
proud
scornfully
listless
air
with
which
she
regarded
him
as
she
leant
back
indolently
and
a
little
insolently
tapping
the
edge
of
the
table
with
her
glove
pray
do
apologise
she
said
languidly
this
is
a
public
room
i
suppose
yes
i
think
so
said
stafford
in
his
pleasant
frank
way
but
one
does
rush
into
a
public
room
with
one
hat
on
if
he
has
reason
to
suppose
that
a
lady
is
present
i
thought
there
was
no
one
here
the
curtain
concealed
you
i
am
sorry
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
gave
him
the
faintest
and
most
condescending
of
bows
then
as
he
reached
the
door
she
said
do
you
think
it
will
be
moonlight
stafford
naturally
looked
rather
surprised
at
this
meteorological
question
i
should
be
surprised
if
it
were
he
said
you
see
this
is
a
very
changeable
climate
and
as
it
is
raining
now
it
will
probably
clear
up
before
the
evening
thanks
she
said
i
am
much
obliged
oh
my
opinion
is
worth
much
he
put
in
parenthetically
but
she
went
on
as
if
he
had
not
spoken
i
should
be
still
further
obliged
if
you
would
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
my
father
he
is
outside
with
the
carriage
somewhere
that
i
am
tired
and
that
i
would
rather
not
go
on
until
the
cool
of
the
evening
certainly
said
stafford
he
waited
a
moment
to
see
if
she
had
any
other
requests
or
rather
orders
and
then
went
out
and
found
the
gentleman
with
the
strongly
marked
countenance
in
the
beside
the
carriage
to
which
the
hostler
and
the
help
were
putting
fresh
horses
stafford
raised
his
hat
slightly
i
am
the
bearer
of
a
message
from
the
young
lady
in
the
sir
he
said
she
wishes
me
to
tell
you
that
she
would
prefer
to
remain
here
until
the
evening
the
man
swung
round
upon
him
with
an
alert
and
curious
manner
half
startled
half
resentful
what
the
devil
i
beg
your
pardon
prefers
to
remain
here
well
he
muttered
something
that
sounded
extremely
like
an
oath
then
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
told
the
hostler
to
take
the
horses
out
thank
you
he
said
to
stafford
grudgingly
i
suppose
my
daughter
is
tired
very
kind
of
you
not
at
all
responded
stafford
politely
and
he
got
on
to
adonis
which
groves
himself
had
led
out
and
rode
away
the
gentleman
looked
after
him
with
knitted
brows
what
is
the
name
of
that
young
fellow
he
asked
of
groves
that
is
stafford
orme
sir
stephen
son
sir
replied
groves
the
gentleman
was
walking
towards
the
house
but
he
pulled
up
short
his
eyes
narrowed
themselves
to
slits
and
his
thick
lips
closed
tightly
a
fine
young
fellow
sir
said
groves
with
respectful
enthusiasm
a
splendid
specimen
of
an
english
gentleman
the
gentleman
grunted
and
went
on
to
the
what
whim
is
this
maude
he
asked
irritably
she
yawned
behind
her
beringed
hand
i
am
tired
i
ca
face
that
stuffy
carriage
again
just
yet
let
us
dine
here
and
go
on
afterwards
in
the
cool
oh
just
as
you
like
he
said
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
i
know
she
assented
then
in
an
indolently
casual
way
she
asked
who
was
that
gentleman
who
rode
by
just
now
her
father
glanced
at
her
suspiciously
as
he
took
off
his
overcoat
now
how
on
earth
should
i
know
my
dear
maude
he
replied
with
a
short
harsh
laugh
some
young
farmer
or
cattle
dealer
i
imagine
i
said
she
retorted
with
something
approaching
insolence
you
will
permit
to
know
the
difference
her
father
coloured
angrily
as
if
she
had
stung
him
you
better
go
upstairs
and
take
off
your
things
while
i
order
dinner
he
said
chapter
ix
as
stafford
rode
homewards
he
wondered
whom
the
strange
pair
could
be
it
was
evident
they
were
not
going
to
stay
at
the
villa
or
they
would
have
driven
straight
there
but
it
was
also
evident
that
the
gentleman
had
heard
of
sir
stephen
little
place
or
he
would
not
have
asked
where
it
was
but
as
stafford
reflected
rather
ruefully
it
would
be
difficult
for
any
traveller
passing
through
the
neighbourhood
not
to
see
the
new
great
white
house
or
to
hear
something
perhaps
a
very
great
deal
of
the
man
who
had
built
it
howard
sauntered
down
the
hall
to
meet
him
good
heavens
how
wet
you
look
and
needless
to
add
how
happy
if
there
is
anything
in
the
doctrine
of
the
transmigration
of
souls
my
dear
stafford
your
future
embodiment
will
be
that
of
a
newfoundland
dog
such
an
extremely
strong
passion
for
cold
water
is
almost
er
indecent
i
had
a
lovely
morning
in
the
library
and
your
father
is
still
at
work
with
his
correspondence
i
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
lord
palmerston
aphorism
that
if
you
left
your
letters
unanswered
long
enough
they
answered
themselves
and
he
admitted
it
was
true
and
that
he
had
sometimes
adopted
the
plan
successfully
there
is
a
secretary
with
him
a
dark
and
silent
man
named
murray
who
appears
to
have
an
automatic
brain
anyway
he
can
write
a
letter
and
answer
questions
at
the
same
time
and
he
watches
your
lips
as
if
he
the
secretary
not
sir
stephen
were
a
dog
waiting
for
a
stone
to
be
thrown
it
is
interesting
to
watch
for
a
time
then
it
gets
on
one
nerves
may
i
ask
where
you
have
been
oh
just
for
a
ride
been
trying
the
new
horse
he
a
clinker
the
governor
could
have
got
hold
of
a
better
if
he
searched
all
arabia
and
hungary
to
boot
i
just
change
and
get
some
lunch
i
hope
you
have
waited
your
hope
is
not
in
vain
young
man
replied
howard
suavely
but
i
will
come
and
sit
beside
you
while
you
stoke
with
measom
aid
stafford
was
soon
into
dry
clothes
and
seated
at
lunch
and
as
he
had
promised
howard
drew
a
chair
to
the
table
and
contemplated
him
with
vicarious
enjoyment
what
an
appetite
you
have
he
drawled
admiringly
i
imagine
it
would
stand
by
you
even
if
you
were
in
love
as
a
specimen
of
the
perfectly
healthy
animal
you
stand
preeminent
my
dear
stafford
by
the
way
shall
i
spoil
your
lunch
if
i
read
you
out
a
list
of
the
guests
whom
we
are
expecting
this
afternoon
sir
stephen
was
good
enough
to
furnish
me
with
it
with
the
amiable
wish
that
i
might
find
some
friend
on
it
what
do
you
say
to
lord
and
lady
fitzharford
the
countess
of
clansford
the
baron
wirsch
the
right
honourable
henry
efford
sir
william
and
lady
plaistow
stafford
looked
up
and
smiled
any
more
oh
yes
there
are
the
two
beltons
and
george
levinson
to
say
nothing
of
griffinberg
the
railroad
king
stafford
stared
at
his
claret
glass
i
wonder
why
the
governor
has
asked
such
a
crowd
he
said
musingly
a
perfectly
arranged
symphony
in
colours
i
call
it
said
howard
fashion
is
represented
by
the
fitzharfords
and
old
lady
clansford
politics
by
efford
and
the
beltons
and
finance
by
plaistow
and
wirsch
that
griffinberg
is
coming
is
a
proof
that
sir
stephen
has
got
little
railway
in
his
mind
there
are
several
others
who
seem
to
have
been
thrown
in
not
to
increase
weight
but
to
lighten
it
it
will
be
rather
amusing
a
kind
of
menagerie
which
under
less
skilful
guidance
than
sir
stephen
might
be
sure
to
disagree
and
fight
stafford
sighed
oh
you
be
all
right
he
said
but
i
do
quite
see
where
i
shall
come
in
howard
laughed
my
dear
stafford
there
are
some
extremely
pretty
girls
with
whom
you
can
flirt
and
i
no
doubt
some
of
the
men
will
join
you
in
your
eccentric
attempts
to
drown
yourself
or
break
your
neck
that
the
sun
coming
out
and
is
it
going
to
clear
i
hope
so
said
stafford
laughing
for
i
prophesied
a
fine
evening
and
a
lady
was
weak
enough
to
take
my
word
for
it
let
us
go
and
rake
my
father
out
of
the
library
and
get
him
into
the
garden
with
a
cigar
you
may
venture
upon
such
an
audacity
but
not
i
said
howard
with
simulated
fear
i
wait
for
you
on
the
terrace
sir
stephen
looked
up
with
a
frown
as
stafford
entered
and
the
secretary
stared
aghast
at
the
intrusion
but
sir
face
cleared
as
he
saw
who
it
was
back
stafford
he
said
what
come
into
the
garden
cigar
certainly
you
can
finish
up
ca
you
murray
thanks
he
looked
at
his
watch
as
they
went
through
the
hall
i
suppose
some
of
the
people
will
be
here
before
long
did
howard
show
you
the
list
do
you
know
any
of
them
stafford
yes
i
met
lady
clansford
and
the
fitzharfords
of
course
but
most
of
them
are
too
great
and
lofty
i
mean
that
they
are
celebrated
personages
out
of
my
small
track
one
does
often
meet
sir
william
plaistow
and
griffinberg
at
at
homes
and
afternoon
teas
sir
stephen
laughed
oh
well
you
must
let
them
bore
you
you
know
my
boy
you
must
consider
yourself
quite
free
to
cut
off
and
amuse
yourself
some
other
way
whenever
you
get
tired
of
them
and
leave
it
all
to
you
sir
said
stafford
with
a
smile
but
as
he
spoke
he
drew
a
breath
of
relief
he
should
be
free
to
help
the
beautiful
lovely
girl
of
herondale
a
few
hours
later
the
visitors
arrived
and
before
dinner
the
superb
was
if
not
crowded
sufficiently
well
filled
with
the
brilliant
company
nearly
all
the
guests
were
extremely
wealthy
most
of
them
were
powerful
either
in
the
region
of
politics
or
finance
and
the
fashionable
world
was
represented
by
some
beautiful
women
with
dresses
and
diamonds
above
reproach
and
some
young
men
whose
names
stood
high
at
hurlingham
and
prinses
stafford
stood
beside
his
father
as
sir
stephen
went
from
group
to
group
greeting
one
and
another
in
his
frank
and
genial
yet
polished
manner
which
grew
warm
and
marked
by
scarcely
repressed
pride
as
he
introduced
stafford
my
son
lady
fitzharford
i
think
he
has
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
i
scarcely
know
who
are
his
friends
we
have
been
separated
so
long
but
we
are
restored
to
each
other
at
last
i
am
happy
to
say
lady
clansford
you
know
my
boy
ah
he
has
had
the
advantage
of
me
all
these
years
he
has
not
had
to
rush
all
over
europe
but
has
been
able
to
bask
in
the
sunshine
of
grace
and
beauty
griffinberg
i
want
my
son
to
know
you
you
and
i
are
such
old
friends
that
you
wo
mind
me
showing
that
i
am
proud
of
him
eh
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
shoulder
with
an
air
of
pride
and
affection
what
a
lovely
place
sir
stephen
has
made
of
this
orme
said
lady
clansford
we
were
quite
startled
as
we
drove
up
and
simply
bewildered
when
we
got
inside
this
room
is
really
oh
well
beggared
for
adjectives
stafford
went
about
listening
to
the
encomiums
on
his
father
or
the
house
and
making
appropriate
responses
but
he
was
rather
relieved
when
the
butler
announced
dinner
the
received
its
meed
of
praise
from
the
guests
and
the
elaborate
caused
some
of
the
men
to
beam
with
inward
satisfaction
it
was
a
superb
dinner
served
with
a
stateliness
which
could
not
have
been
exceeded
if
royalty
had
been
amongst
the
guests
the
plate
was
magnificent
the
flowers
arranged
by
an
artist
hand
in
rich
and
yet
chaste
abundance
stafford
as
he
looked
from
the
bottom
of
the
table
to
sir
stephen
at
the
head
felt
with
a
thrill
of
pride
that
his
father
was
the
most
man
of
them
all
and
he
noticed
that
in
the
tone
of
both
the
men
and
the
women
who
addressed
him
there
was
that
subtle
note
which
indicates
respect
and
the
consideration
which
men
and
women
of
the
world
pay
to
one
who
has
achieved
greatness
and
yet
he
noticed
also
that
not
one
of
them
was
more
perfectly
at
his
ease
than
sir
stephen
who
laughed
and
talked
as
if
his
only
aim
was
that
of
enjoyment
and
as
if
he
had
never
planned
a
plan
or
schemed
a
scheme
every
now
and
then
stafford
caught
his
father
eye
and
each
time
he
did
so
sir
stephen
smiled
at
him
with
that
air
of
pride
and
affection
which
he
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
or
check
once
or
twice
howard
too
caught
his
eye
and
smiled
significantly
as
if
he
were
saying
how
is
this
for
a
successful
party
the
dinner
went
swimmingly
and
when
the
ladies
had
retired
sir
stephen
begged
the
men
to
close
up
and
passed
the
wine
freely
the
talk
was
of
everything
but
politics
or
business
stafford
remarked
that
not
a
word
was
said
of
either
topic
and
sir
stephen
told
one
or
two
stories
admirably
and
set
the
laughter
going
what
sort
of
a
night
is
it
stafford
he
asked
presently
stafford
drew
the
curtain
from
the
open
french
window
and
the
moonlight
streamed
in
to
fight
with
the
electric
lamps
shall
we
go
out
on
to
the
terrace
said
sir
stephen
quite
warm
enough
is
it
they
went
out
servants
brought
coffee
and
cigars
and
some
of
the
gentlemen
sauntered
up
and
down
the
terrace
and
others
went
down
into
the
garden
sir
stephen
linked
his
arm
in
stafford
and
they
walked
a
little
apart
along
one
of
the
smooth
paths
not
bored
i
hope
my
boy
he
asked
good
gracious
no
sir
replied
stafford
i
do
think
i
remember
a
more
successful
dinner
why
should
i
be
bored
that
all
right
said
sir
stephen
pressing
his
arm
i
was
afraid
you
might
be
they
are
not
a
bad
set
the
men
i
mean
if
you
keep
them
off
their
hobbies
and
we
managed
to
do
that
i
think
yes
i
noticed
you
managed
them
very
well
sir
said
stafford
what
a
lovely
night
they
had
reached
a
gate
opening
on
to
the
road
and
they
stood
and
looked
at
the
view
in
silence
for
a
moment
listening
to
a
nightingale
whose
clear
notes
joined
with
the
voices
and
laughter
of
the
guests
suddenly
another
sound
came
upon
the
night
air
a
clatter
of
hoofs
and
the
rattle
of
wheels
someone
driving
down
the
road
said
sir
stephen
and
coming
at
a
deuce
of
a
pace
said
stafford
he
opened
the
gate
and
looked
up
the
road
then
he
uttered
an
ejaculation
by
george
they
bolted
he
said
in
his
quiet
way
what
asked
sir
stephen
as
he
too
came
out
the
carriage
was
tearing
down
the
hill
towards
them
in
the
moonlight
and
stafford
saw
that
the
horses
were
rushing
along
with
lowered
heads
and
that
the
driver
had
lost
all
control
of
them
as
they
came
towards
the
two
men
stafford
set
off
running
towards
them
sir
stephen
called
him
stafford
took
no
heed
and
as
the
horses
came
up
to
him
he
sprang
at
the
head
of
the
nearer
one
there
was
a
scramble
a
scuffing
of
hoofs
and
a
loud
shrill
shriek
from
the
interior
of
the
carriage
then
the
horses
were
forced
on
to
their
haunches
and
stafford
scrambled
to
his
feet
from
the
road
into
which
he
had
been
hustled
the
driver
jumped
down
and
ran
to
the
horses
heads
the
carriage
door
was
flung
open
and
the
gentleman
of
the
inn
leapt
out
leapt
out
almost
on
to
sir
stephen
who
ran
up
breathless
with
apprehension
on
stafford
account
the
two
men
stood
and
looked
at
each
other
in
the
moonlight
at
first
with
a
confused
and
bewildered
gaze
then
sir
stephen
started
back
with
a
cry
a
strange
cry
which
brought
stafford
to
his
side
at
the
same
moment
the
girl
he
had
seen
in
the
at
the
inn
slipped
out
of
the
carriage
are
we
safe
she
asked
faintly
how
did
we
stop
who
she
stopped
abruptly
and
both
she
and
stafford
stared
at
the
two
men
who
were
standing
confronting
each
other
sir
stephen
was
as
white
as
a
ghost
and
there
was
a
look
of
absolute
terror
in
his
dark
eyes
on
the
face
of
the
other
man
was
an
enigmatical
smile
which
was
more
bitter
than
a
sneer
you
are
all
right
said
stafford
but
i
am
afraid
you
were
very
much
frightened
the
girl
turned
to
him
you
she
said
recognising
him
did
you
stop
them
yes
it
was
easy
they
had
had
almost
enough
he
said
while
they
were
speaking
the
two
elder
men
drew
apart
as
if
instinctively
falconer
murmured
sir
stephen
with
ashy
lips
yes
assented
the
other
drily
yes
i
am
here
right
enough
which
is
it
to
be
friend
or
foe
sir
stephen
stood
gnawing
his
lip
for
a
moment
then
he
turned
to
stafford
stafford
this
most
extraordinary
this
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
falconer
this
is
my
boy
my
son
stafford
chapter
x
a
very
old
friend
of
your
father
said
falconer
and
his
keen
eyes
looked
into
stafford
as
he
held
out
his
hand
then
he
turned
to
sir
stephen
whose
face
had
resumed
its
usual
serenity
and
was
fixed
in
the
smile
appropriate
to
the
occasion
stafford
orme
and
i
have
met
before
sir
stephen
shot
an
enquiring
glance
from
one
to
the
other
at
the
inn
at
the
other
side
of
the
lake
my
daughter
maude
and
i
have
been
resting
there
for
a
few
hours
maude
he
said
to
that
young
lady
who
was
standing
looking
on
at
the
group
generally
but
more
particularly
under
her
lids
at
stafford
tall
figure
this
is
a
very
strange
meeting
between
old
friends
sir
stephen
orme
and
i
have
met
for
how
long
ago
is
it
orme
sir
stephen
shook
his
head
and
raised
his
thick
dark
brows
too
long
for
us
to
go
back
especially
in
the
presence
of
these
young
people
whom
we
are
always
trying
to
persuade
that
we
are
not
old
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
my
dear
young
lady
and
i
am
devoured
by
curiosity
to
know
how
it
is
that
you
are
here
well
we
owe
it
to
your
son
orme
here
i
should
imagine
sir
stephen
she
replied
she
had
fully
recovered
her
and
her
manner
and
voice
had
all
the
tone
of
pride
and
indolence
which
stafford
had
noticed
when
he
met
her
at
the
inn
if
he
had
not
stopped
the
horses
i
suppose
we
should
have
either
been
killed
or
on
the
way
to
the
nearest
hospital
by
the
way
have
you
thanked
orme
yet
father
not
yet
and
i
shall
find
it
difficult
to
do
so
said
falconer
thanks
are
poor
return
for
one
life
orme
i
hope
you
were
not
hurt
he
glanced
at
stafford
usually
immaculate
which
were
covered
with
dust
on
one
side
and
displayed
a
rent
in
the
sleeve
of
the
coat
oh
that
all
right
sir
returned
stafford
with
all
an
englishman
dread
of
a
fuss
they
stopped
short
the
moment
i
got
hold
of
them
and
i
only
slipped
and
got
up
directly
you
are
not
hurt
then
stafford
said
sir
stephen
as
i
came
up
i
thought
was
afraid
that
you
were
smashed
up
and
i
daresay
i
showed
my
fear
it
my
only
boy
falconer
he
looked
at
his
old
friend
meaningly
and
falconer
promptly
backed
him
up
well
yes
you
looked
fairly
startled
and
scared
he
said
but
now
if
the
horses
are
all
right
we
may
as
well
get
on
we
have
given
you
quite
trouble
enough
the
horses
are
all
right
sir
said
the
driver
i
managed
to
take
up
the
broken
trace
it
was
that
that
startled
them
sir
and
be
quiet
enough
now
oh
but
where
are
you
going
said
sir
stephen
with
hospitable
eagerness
were
you
not
coming
to
us
to
the
villa
no
we
were
going
to
keswick
said
falconer
my
daughter
had
a
fancy
for
seeing
the
lake
district
and
we
are
making
a
kind
of
tour
you
have
no
other
engagement
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
said
sir
stephen
oh
i
take
no
denial
what
do
you
think
i
shall
part
with
an
old
friend
so
quickly
and
after
such
a
er
sudden
and
unexpected
meeting
miss
falconer
let
me
beg
you
to
plead
with
your
father
for
me
falconer
regarded
sir
stephen
for
a
moment
curiously
then
looked
towards
his
daughter
her
fine
eyes
rested
on
stafford
face
and
he
could
do
not
less
than
repeat
his
father
invitation
i
hope
you
consent
miss
falconer
he
said
you
have
no
doubt
been
a
little
upset
by
the
accident
and
it
is
rather
late
to
go
on
pray
stay
with
us
thanks
i
shall
be
delighted
she
said
with
her
indolent
regal
air
by
this
time
as
they
went
towards
the
gate
some
of
the
men
who
had
been
walking
in
the
garden
came
up
and
howard
voice
called
out
hallo
stafford
anything
the
matter
no
nothing
whatever
said
stafford
promptly
and
sir
stephen
seized
the
opportunity
to
steer
the
falconers
through
the
group
some
old
friends
of
mine
howard
their
carriage
broke
down
fortunately
at
our
very
door
this
way
falconer
stafford
will
you
give
miss
maude
your
arm
strange
our
meeting
again
so
soon
and
under
such
circumstances
she
said
you
must
have
stopped
those
horses
very
pluckily
i
thought
that
kind
of
thing
was
out
of
date
now
and
that
gentlemen
only
called
the
police
on
such
occasions
you
are
sure
you
are
not
hurt
i
thought
from
your
father
face
you
must
be
he
must
be
very
fond
of
you
to
look
so
scared
he
was
as
white
as
a
ghost
he
is
fond
of
me
i
hope
and
think
said
stafford
candidly
i
did
not
think
he
would
be
so
alarmed
but
i
do
know
him
very
well
yet
we
have
been
living
apart
until
just
recently
why
that
is
my
case
she
said
my
father
and
i
were
strangers
until
the
other
day
when
he
came
from
abroad
what
a
beautiful
house
it
is
like
a
miniature
palace
she
looked
at
the
villa
and
then
at
stafford
with
renewed
interest
i
suppose
your
father
is
sir
stephen
orme
of
whom
one
has
heard
so
much
i
did
not
think
of
it
until
this
moment
stafford
was
giving
instructions
that
the
falconers
carriage
should
be
seen
to
and
so
was
spared
a
reply
she
stood
in
the
hall
looking
round
with
a
kind
of
indolent
admiration
and
surprise
and
perfectly
though
the
hall
was
rapidly
filling
with
the
men
from
the
garden
you
would
like
to
go
to
your
rooms
at
once
said
sir
stephen
in
his
serene
and
courtly
voice
if
you
should
be
too
tired
to
come
down
again
i
will
have
some
dinner
sent
up
to
you
but
i
hope
you
wo
be
it
would
be
a
great
disappointment
oh
i
am
not
at
all
tired
said
miss
falconer
as
she
followed
the
housekeeper
and
the
two
demure
maids
up
the
exquisite
staircase
sir
stephen
looked
after
them
with
a
bland
smile
then
he
turned
to
stafford
and
caught
his
arm
not
hurt
my
boy
he
said
in
a
tone
of
strained
anxiety
stafford
was
beginning
to
get
tired
of
the
question
and
answered
rather
impatiently
not
in
the
least
sir
why
should
i
be
i
change
my
things
and
be
down
in
five
minutes
yes
yes
sir
stephen
still
eyed
him
with
barely
concealed
anxiety
strange
coincidence
stafford
i
i
have
seen
ralph
falconer
for
for
ever
so
many
years
and
he
is
thrown
at
my
very
gate
and
they
say
there
is
no
such
thing
as
fate
had
you
better
go
into
the
sir
stafford
reminded
him
they
think
something
has
happened
eh
yes
yes
of
course
said
sir
stephen
with
a
little
start
as
if
he
had
been
lost
in
thought
but
he
waited
until
he
saw
stafford
walk
up
the
stairs
without
any
sign
of
a
limp
before
he
followed
his
advice
the
butler
who
was
too
sharp
to
need
any
instructions
quickly
served
a
choice
little
dinner
for
the
unexpected
guests
and
stafford
who
had
waited
in
the
hall
accompanied
them
into
the
miss
falconer
had
changed
her
for
a
rich
and
the
jewels
stafford
had
noticed
were
supplemented
by
some
remarkably
fine
diamonds
i
wish
you
had
come
in
time
for
dinner
he
said
as
he
conducted
her
to
her
seat
so
do
i
she
returned
serenely
we
are
giving
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
we
are
keeping
you
from
your
guests
the
maid
who
waited
on
me
told
me
that
you
had
a
large
house
party
yes
said
stafford
it
is
a
kind
of
my
father
intends
settling
in
england
for
some
time
i
think
he
added
and
he
has
built
this
place
falconer
looked
up
from
his
plate
in
his
alert
watchful
way
sir
stephen
plans
rather
uncertain
he
said
i
remember
he
always
used
to
be
rather
erratic
well
if
he
means
settling
he
made
himself
a
very
cosy
nest
he
looked
round
the
magnificent
room
with
a
curious
smile
a
wonderful
man
your
father
mr
orme
yes
said
stafford
with
a
smile
yes
of
course
i
heard
of
his
great
doings
who
has
did
you
ever
hear
him
speak
of
me
we
were
great
friends
one
time
no
i
do
think
i
have
replied
stafford
but
as
i
was
telling
miss
falconer
i
have
not
seen
very
much
of
him
ah
yes
just
so
assented
falconer
and
he
went
on
with
his
dinner
stafford
had
taken
a
seat
at
the
table
and
poured
out
a
glass
of
wine
so
that
they
might
not
hurry
but
he
felt
that
he
need
not
have
been
anxious
on
that
account
for
the
girl
ate
her
dinner
in
a
most
leisurely
manner
talking
to
him
in
her
soft
slow
voice
and
looking
at
him
from
under
her
lids
she
talked
of
the
scenery
of
the
quaint
inns
and
hotels
they
had
put
up
at
of
the
various
inconveniences
which
she
had
suffered
on
the
way
then
suddenly
she
raised
her
lids
and
looked
at
him
fully
and
steadily
i
suppose
the
young
lady
we
saw
with
you
this
morning
is
your
sister
with
all
his
natural
simplicity
stafford
was
a
man
of
the
world
and
he
did
not
redden
or
look
embarrassed
by
the
suddenness
of
the
question
and
the
direct
gaze
of
the
luminous
eyes
no
he
said
i
have
neither
sister
nor
brother
only
my
father
she
was
a
friend
oh
she
said
then
after
a
pause
she
was
very
pretty
stafford
nodded
like
a
flash
floated
before
him
the
exquisite
loveliness
of
ida
heron
do
you
think
so
he
said
with
affected
indifference
why
yes
do
you
she
retorted
oh
yes
he
assented
but
i
did
know
whether
you
would
men
and
women
so
very
seldom
agree
upon
the
question
of
looks
i
find
that
most
of
the
women
i
think
pretty
are
considered
next
door
to
plain
by
my
well
there
ca
be
any
doubt
as
to
your
friend
good
looks
she
said
she
made
rather
a
striking
not
to
say
startling
figure
perched
sideways
on
that
horse
in
the
pelting
rain
i
suppose
she
is
one
of
your
neighbours
yes
replied
stafford
as
easily
and
casually
as
he
could
for
the
face
still
floated
before
him
yes
but
not
a
very
near
one
let
me
give
you
some
more
wine
no
thanks
father
have
you
nearly
finished
orme
has
kept
us
company
so
nicely
that
we
been
tempted
to
forget
that
we
are
keeping
him
from
his
guests
she
rose
and
with
a
peculiarly
sinuous
movement
threw
out
the
train
of
her
dress
and
swept
languidly
to
the
door
stafford
offered
her
his
arm
and
they
entered
the
her
appearance
naturally
caused
a
little
sensation
for
some
of
the
men
had
learnt
and
told
of
the
story
of
stafford
plucky
arrest
of
the
bolting
horses
and
the
people
were
curious
to
see
the
father
and
daughter
who
had
been
rescued
and
who
had
proved
to
be
friends
of
sir
stephen
by
a
sort
of
tacit
understanding
lady
clausford
who
was
a
individual
was
playing
the
part
of
hostess
and
general
chaperon
and
stafford
led
miss
falconer
up
to
her
before
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
passed
miss
falconer
seemed
to
be
quite
at
home
in
her
novel
surroundings
and
leaning
back
in
her
chair
and
slowly
fanning
herself
received
with
perfect
the
attentions
which
her
beauty
her
costly
dress
and
her
still
more
costly
jewels
merited
presently
stafford
heard
lady
clansford
ask
her
to
sing
and
he
went
to
conduct
her
to
the
piano
my
music
is
upstairs
in
my
box
but
it
does
not
matter
i
will
try
and
remember
something
she
said
i
wonder
what
you
like
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
as
her
fingers
touched
the
keys
the
simple
ballad
would
be
rather
out
of
place
would
it
do
you
know
this
thing
of
wagner
as
she
began
to
sing
the
talking
died
down
and
gradually
ceased
and
every
eye
was
fixed
upon
her
for
it
was
evident
that
she
not
only
had
an
exquisite
voice
but
knew
how
to
use
it
she
sang
like
an
artist
and
apparently
without
the
least
effort
the
liquid
notes
flowing
from
her
red
lips
like
the
water
of
a
mountain
rill
stafford
was
surprised
almost
startled
but
as
he
stood
beside
her
he
was
thinking
strangely
enough
not
so
much
of
the
singer
as
of
the
girl
he
was
going
to
meet
on
the
morrow
when
she
had
finished
there
was
a
general
murmur
of
applause
and
lady
clansford
glided
to
the
piano
and
asked
her
to
sing
again
you
have
a
really
wonderful
voice
miss
falconer
i
do
think
melba
ever
sang
that
better
melba
register
is
ever
so
much
greater
than
mine
remarked
miss
falconer
calmly
no
thanks
i
wo
sing
again
i
think
i
am
a
little
tired
she
went
back
to
her
seat
slowly
her
fan
moving
languidly
as
if
she
were
too
conscious
of
the
worth
of
her
voice
to
be
affected
by
the
murmurs
of
applause
and
admiration
and
stafford
as
his
eyes
followed
her
thought
she
resembled
a
superb
tropical
flower
of
rich
and
subtle
colouring
and
soft
and
languorous
grace
none
of
the
women
would
venture
to
sing
after
this
exhibition
and
one
of
the
young
men
went
to
the
piano
and
dashed
off
a
song
which
relieved
the
tension
produced
by
miss
falconer
magnificent
voice
and
style
then
the
woman
began
to
glance
at
the
clock
and
rise
and
stand
about
preparatory
to
going
to
bed
and
presently
they
went
off
lingering
talking
and
laughing
in
the
hall
and
in
the
corridors
the
men
drifted
into
the
billiard
and
and
sir
stephen
started
a
pool
he
had
been
at
his
very
best
in
the
moving
about
amongst
the
brilliant
crowd
with
a
word
for
each
and
all
and
pleased
smile
on
his
handsome
face
and
a
happy
genial
brightness
in
his
voice
once
or
twice
sir
stephen
approached
falconer
who
leant
against
the
wall
looking
on
with
the
alert
watchful
eyes
half
screened
behind
his
lids
which
like
his
daughter
had
a
trick
of
drooping
though
with
a
very
different
expression
your
daughter
has
a
magnificent
voice
falconer
sir
stephen
had
said
in
a
congratulatory
voice
and
falconer
had
nodded
yes
she
been
well
taught
i
believe
he
had
responded
laconically
and
sir
stephen
had
nodded
emphatically
and
moved
away
will
you
play
falconer
he
asked
as
stafford
gave
out
the
balls
you
used
to
play
a
good
game
falconer
shrugged
his
shoulders
have
played
for
years
rather
look
on
he
said
let
me
give
you
a
cigar
try
these
they
are
all
right
stafford
says
falconer
seated
himself
in
one
of
the
lounges
and
looked
at
the
players
and
round
the
handsome
room
in
contemplative
silence
sir
stephen
eye
wandered
covertly
towards
him
now
and
again
and
once
he
said
to
stafford
see
if
falconer
has
some
whiskey
my
boy
as
stafford
went
up
to
falconer
corner
he
saw
that
griffinberg
and
baron
wirsch
had
joined
him
the
three
men
were
talking
in
the
low
confidential
tone
characteristic
of
city
men
when
they
are
discussing
the
sacred
subject
of
money
and
stafford
caught
the
words
sir
stephen
south
african
railway
falconer
looked
round
sharply
as
stafford
stood
at
his
elbow
eh
whiskey
oh
yes
thanks
i
have
some
he
said
as
stafford
returned
to
the
falconer
nodded
after
him
is
the
son
in
this
he
asked
sharply
oh
no
replied
the
baron
with
a
smile
he
knows
nothing
he
ees
too
young
too
vat
do
you
say
too
vashionable
frivolous
no
sir
stephen
does
bring
him
in
at
all
you
understand
he
is
ze
ornamental
shleeping
pardner
eh
and
he
chuckled
falconer
nodded
and
leaning
forward
continued
the
conversation
in
a
low
voice
the
men
went
off
to
bed
one
by
one
and
presently
only
sir
stephen
stafford
and
falconer
remained
and
as
the
latter
rose
as
if
to
retire
sir
stephen
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
do
go
yet
i
should
like
to
have
a
little
chat
with
you
about
old
times
falconer
sank
into
his
seat
again
and
took
a
fresh
cigar
and
stafford
left
them
chapter
xi
sir
stephen
closed
the
door
after
him
then
went
back
to
the
and
stood
looking
down
at
falconer
who
leant
back
in
his
chair
with
his
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
eyed
sir
stephen
under
lids
with
an
expression
which
had
something
of
mastery
and
power
in
it
sir
stephen
bit
at
the
end
of
his
moustache
his
thick
black
brows
lowered
as
if
he
scarcely
knew
how
to
begin
the
chat
and
falconer
waited
without
any
offer
of
assistance
at
last
sir
stephen
said
you
asked
me
outside
just
now
falconer
if
it
was
to
be
or
foe
i
thinking
the
question
ought
to
have
come
from
me
yes
assented
falconer
his
eyes
growing
still
narrower
yes
i
suppose
it
ought
would
your
answer
have
been
the
same
as
mine
asked
sir
stephen
in
a
low
voice
falconer
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
said
it
ought
to
have
been
if
ever
a
man
had
cause
to
regard
another
as
an
enemy
i
had
cause
to
regard
you
as
one
orme
sir
stephen
flushed
then
went
pale
again
there
is
no
use
in
raking
up
the
past
he
muttered
oh
i
no
need
to
rake
it
up
it
here
right
enough
without
raking
retorted
falconer
and
he
touched
his
breast
with
his
thick
forefinger
i
not
likely
to
forget
the
trick
you
played
me
not
likely
to
forget
the
man
who
turned
on
me
and
robbed
me
robbed
echoed
sir
stephen
with
a
dark
frown
falconer
turned
his
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
bit
at
it
yes
robbed
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
my
memory
is
a
better
one
than
yours
and
i
not
likely
to
forget
the
day
i
tramped
back
to
the
claim
in
that
australian
hole
to
find
that
discovered
the
gold
while
i
been
on
the
trail
to
raise
food
and
money
discovered
it
and
sold
out
and
cleared
out
his
eyes
flashed
redly
and
his
mouth
twitched
as
his
teeth
almost
met
in
the
choice
havana
sir
stephen
threw
out
his
hand
i
heard
you
were
dead
he
said
hoarsely
i
heard
that
you
had
died
in
a
street
row
in
melbourne
falconer
heavy
face
was
distorted
by
a
sneer
yes
of
course
i
do
believe
you
who
would
as
heaven
is
my
witness
exclaimed
sir
stephen
but
falconer
went
on
you
did
wait
to
see
if
it
were
true
or
not
you
cleared
out
before
i
time
to
get
back
and
you
took
precious
good
care
not
to
make
enquiries
no
directly
your
partner
back
was
turned
you
sold
him
got
the
price
and
levanted
sir
stephen
paced
up
and
done
his
hands
clenched
behind
him
his
fine
leonine
head
bent
then
he
stopped
in
front
of
the
chair
and
frowned
down
into
the
scowling
face
falconer
you
wrong
me
it
was
not
so
bad
so
black
as
it
looked
true
i
sold
the
claim
but
i
swear
that
i
intended
saving
half
for
you
but
news
was
brought
in
that
you
were
dead
a
man
said
that
he
had
seen
you
fall
that
you
were
dead
and
buried
i
had
to
leave
the
camp
the
night
the
money
was
paid
it
would
not
have
been
safe
to
remain
you
know
what
the
place
was
and
that
the
man
who
was
known
to
have
money
carried
his
life
in
his
hand
i
left
the
camp
and
tramped
south
before
a
month
had
passed
the
money
had
gone
if
i
had
had
any
doubts
of
your
death
it
was
too
late
to
enquire
it
would
have
been
useless
as
i
tell
you
the
money
was
gone
but
i
had
any
doubts
in
simple
truth
i
thought
you
were
dead
falconer
looked
round
the
luxurious
room
you
lost
the
money
but
you
appear
to
have
picked
it
up
again
you
seem
to
be
pretty
flourishing
my
friend
when
you
got
on
your
feet
again
and
made
your
pile
why
did
you
find
out
whether
your
old
pal
was
alive
or
dead
sir
stephen
was
silent
for
a
space
then
he
raised
his
head
and
met
the
other
accusing
gaze
unflinchingly
i
tell
you
i
tell
you
the
whole
truth
falconer
and
if
you
can
make
excuse
for
me
if
you
can
put
yourself
in
my
place
he
drew
his
hand
across
his
brow
as
if
the
sweat
had
broken
out
upon
it
the
luck
was
dead
against
me
for
a
time
the
old
luck
that
had
haunted
you
and
me
then
it
swung
round
completely
as
it
generally
does
when
it
changes
at
all
i
was
out
in
africa
on
the
tramp
picking
up
a
day
work
now
and
again
at
the
farms
you
know
the
life
one
day
i
saw
a
kaffir
boy
playing
with
some
rough
stones
falconer
nodded
diamonds
i
fancy
i
read
an
account
of
the
great
sir
stephen
first
beginnings
he
put
in
with
a
touch
of
sarcasm
sir
stephen
reddened
i
daresay
it
was
the
start
the
commencement
of
the
luck
from
the
evening
i
took
those
stones
in
my
hands
great
heaven
i
can
see
the
place
now
the
sunset
on
the
hill
the
dirty
brat
playing
in
the
dust
the
luck
has
stood
by
me
everything
i
touched
turned
out
right
i
left
the
diamond
business
and
went
in
for
land
wherever
i
bought
land
towns
sprang
up
and
the
land
increased
in
value
a
thousandfold
then
i
stood
in
with
the
natives
you
heard
of
the
treaty
falconer
nodded
the
treaty
that
enabled
you
to
hand
over
so
many
thousand
square
miles
to
the
government
in
exchange
for
a
knighthood
no
said
sir
stephen
simply
i
got
that
for
another
business
but
i
daresay
the
other
thing
helped
it
does
matter
then
i
i
married
i
married
the
daughter
of
a
man
of
position
a
girl
who
who
loved
and
trusted
me
who
knew
nothing
of
the
past
you
and
i
know
and
as
i
would
rather
have
died
than
that
she
should
have
known
anything
of
it
i
conveniently
and
decently
buried
it
put
in
falconer
oh
yes
i
can
see
the
whole
thing
you
had
blossomed
out
from
black
steve
sir
stephen
rose
and
took
a
step
towards
the
door
then
remembered
that
he
had
shut
it
and
sank
down
again
his
face
white
as
ashes
his
lips
quivering
to
sir
stephen
orme
the
african
millionaire
the
high
and
lofty
english
gentleman
with
his
head
full
of
state
secrets
and
his
safe
full
of
foreign
loans
sir
stephen
orme
the
pioneer
the
empire
maker
oh
yes
i
can
understand
how
naturally
you
would
bury
the
past
as
you
had
buried
your
old
pal
and
partner
the
dainty
and
delicate
lady
orme
was
to
hear
nothing
sir
stephen
rose
and
stretched
out
his
hand
half
warningly
half
imploringly
she
dead
falconer
he
said
hoarsely
do
do
speak
of
her
leave
her
out
for
god
sake
falconer
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
this
boy
of
yours
he
as
ignorant
as
her
ladyship
was
of
course
sir
stephen
inclined
his
head
yes
he
said
huskily
he
he
knows
nothing
he
thinks
me
what
the
world
sees
me
what
all
the
world
saving
you
falconer
thinks
me
one
who
has
risen
from
humble
but
honest
poverty
to
what
i
am
you
have
seen
him
you
can
understand
what
i
feel
that
i
rather
die
than
that
he
should
know
that
he
should
think
badly
of
me
falconer
i
have
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
i
in
your
hands
i
i
at
your
mercy
i
appeal
to
you
he
stretched
out
his
white
shapely
hands
you
have
a
child
of
your
own
she
as
dear
to
you
as
mine
is
to
me
i
watched
you
and
i
seen
you
look
at
her
as
she
moved
about
and
talked
and
sang
with
the
look
that
my
eyes
wear
when
they
rest
on
my
boy
i
am
at
your
mercy
not
only
mine
but
my
son
future
he
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
and
drew
a
long
breath
falconer
leant
back
and
smoked
contemplatively
with
a
coolness
an
indifference
to
the
other
emotion
which
sir
stephen
found
maddening
yes
said
falconer
after
a
pause
i
suppose
your
house
of
cards
would
come
down
with
a
crash
if
i
opened
my
mouth
say
at
breakfast
morning
and
told
well
all
i
know
of
the
great
sir
stephen
orme
when
he
bore
the
name
of
black
steve
even
you
with
all
you
colossal
assurance
could
not
face
it
or
outlive
it
and
as
for
the
boy
it
would
settle
his
hash
now
and
forever
a
word
from
me
would
do
it
eh
orme
and
upon
my
soul
i
do
know
why
i
should
say
it
i
had
it
in
my
mind
i
kept
it
as
a
sweet
morsel
for
a
good
many
years
yes
i
been
looking
forward
to
it
i
been
waiting
for
the
moment
as
i
think
they
call
it
and
it
strikes
me
that
it
has
arrived
sir
stephen
face
grew
strained
and
a
curious
expression
crept
into
it
if
you
ask
me
why
you
should
not
i
can
give
you
no
reason
he
said
if
you
were
poor
i
should
offer
you
money
more
a
great
deal
more
than
i
received
for
the
old
claim
but
i
can
see
that
that
would
not
tempt
you
to
forego
your
revenge
falconer
you
are
not
poor
your
daughter
wears
diamonds
falconer
shrugged
his
shoulders
no
i
not
in
want
of
money
you
not
the
only
man
who
has
had
a
change
of
luck
no
you
ca
bribe
me
even
if
i
were
hard
up
instead
of
rather
flush
as
i
am
i
would
take
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
for
my
revenge
sir
stephen
rose
there
was
an
ominous
change
in
his
manner
his
nervousness
and
apprehension
seemed
to
have
suddenly
left
him
and
in
its
place
was
a
terrible
stony
calmness
an
air
of
inflexible
determination
good
he
said
and
his
voice
had
changed
also
changed
from
its
faltering
tone
of
appeal
to
one
of
steadfast
resolution
the
steadiness
of
desperation
i
have
made
my
appeal
to
you
falconer
and
i
gather
that
i
have
failed
to
move
you
that
you
intend
to
exact
your
revenge
by
denouncing
me
falconer
nodded
coolly
and
you
think
that
i
could
endure
to
live
under
such
a
threat
to
walk
about
with
the
sword
of
damocles
over
my
head
you
ought
to
know
me
better
falconer
i
will
not
live
to
endure
the
shame
you
can
inflict
on
me
i
will
not
live
to
tempt
you
by
the
sight
of
me
to
take
your
revenge
i
shall
die
falconer
eyed
him
intently
and
carefully
selected
a
fresh
cigar
when
he
had
as
carefully
lit
it
he
said
callously
that
your
business
of
course
i
should
venture
to
interfere
with
any
plan
of
that
kind
so
you
sneak
out
of
it
eh
orme
sneak
out
of
it
and
leave
that
young
fellow
to
bear
the
brunt
well
i
sorry
for
him
he
seems
the
right
sort
deuced
and
yes
i
d
d
sorry
for
him
once
again
sir
stephen
lips
twitched
and
the
big
drops
of
sweat
stood
on
his
brow
he
stood
for
a
minute
looking
from
right
to
left
like
a
hunted
animal
at
bay
then
with
something
between
a
groan
and
a
cry
of
savagery
he
spring
towards
falconer
with
his
hands
outstretched
and
making
for
his
tormentor
throat
before
he
could
sweep
the
table
aside
and
get
at
him
falconer
whipped
a
revolver
from
his
pocket
and
aimed
it
at
sir
stephen
you
fool
he
said
in
his
harsh
grating
voice
did
you
think
i
was
such
an
idiot
as
to
trust
myself
alone
with
you
unarmed
did
you
think
i
forgotten
what
sort
of
man
you
were
or
imagined
that
you
so
changed
that
i
could
trust
you
bah
sit
down
stand
back
or
by
heaven
i
shoot
you
as
i
would
a
dog
sir
stephen
shrank
back
his
hand
to
his
heart
his
eyes
distended
his
face
livid
as
if
he
were
choking
and
sank
into
a
chair
falconer
returned
the
revolver
into
his
pocket
and
with
his
foot
pushed
the
inlaid
oriental
table
towards
his
host
and
victim
there
take
some
brandy
you
too
old
to
play
these
tricks
that
heart
of
yours
was
never
worth
much
in
the
old
days
and
i
daresay
still
more
groggy
besides
we
not
in
a
mining
camp
or
the
backwoods
now
he
sneered
we
in
sir
stephen
orme
palatial
villa
on
lake
bryndermere
sir
stephen
stretched
out
his
hand
and
felt
for
the
decanter
as
if
he
were
suddenly
blind
and
could
not
see
it
and
poured
himself
out
some
brandy
falconer
watched
him
narrowly
critically
better
look
here
orme
take
my
advice
and
keep
a
guard
on
your
emotions
you
ca
afford
to
have
any
with
a
heart
like
that
he
paused
and
waited
until
sir
stephen
ashy
face
had
resumed
a
less
deathly
pallor
and
now
i
answer
your
appeal
i
do
intend
to
denounce
you
sir
stephen
turned
to
him
with
a
gesture
of
incredulity
sounds
strange
does
it
humph
does
it
strike
you
that
i
had
my
revenge
already
if
there
is
a
sweeter
one
than
to
see
the
man
who
has
sold
you
grovelling
at
your
feet
and
praying
for
mercy
than
i
do
know
it
the
great
sir
stephen
orme
too
he
laughed
sneeringly
no
if
i
meant
to
give
you
away
orme
i
should
have
done
it
in
your
swell
with
all
your
swell
guests
round
you
with
your
son
ay
and
my
daughter
to
hear
the
story
the
story
of
black
steve
but
i
did
mean
it
and
i
do
sir
stephen
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
and
drank
some
more
brandy
thank
god
he
murmured
what
can
i
say
what
can
i
do
to
to
express
my
gratitude
my
sense
of
your
forbearance
falconer
falconer
with
his
eyes
narrowed
to
slits
looked
at
him
keenly
oh
i
dispense
with
your
gratitude
orme
we
agree
to
forgive
and
forget
this
is
the
last
word
we
say
about
it
sir
stephen
as
if
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
ears
gazed
at
his
magnanimous
foe
in
silence
no
half
measures
with
me
you
remember
me
of
old
said
falconer
the
subject
done
with
he
moved
his
thick
hand
as
he
were
sweeping
it
away
pass
the
whiskey
thanks
now
let
have
the
chat
you
kept
me
up
for
sir
stephen
wiped
his
lips
and
forced
a
smile
tell
me
about
yourself
what
you
have
been
doing
since
we
er
all
this
long
time
falconer
shrugged
his
shoulders
oh
it
is
as
interesting
a
story
as
yours
he
said
i
just
rubbed
along
with
bad
and
good
luck
in
streaks
fortunately
for
me
the
good
ones
were
thicker
and
more
frequent
than
the
bad
ones
lake
yourself
i
married
like
yourself
a
widower
i
one
child
maude
she
been
at
school
and
under
the
care
of
some
people
on
the
continent
while
i
been
at
work
and
come
to
england
now
to
settle
down
that
tells
enough
of
my
story
i
know
yours
as
the
rest
of
the
world
does
you
famous
you
see
there
was
a
pause
then
he
looked
over
his
glass
and
said
what
you
little
game
at
the
present
moment
orme
sir
stephen
looked
at
him
interrogatively
as
if
he
were
still
rather
confused
by
the
terrible
scene
which
they
had
gone
through
why
have
you
built
this
place
and
got
all
these
people
here
said
falconer
i
know
enough
of
wirsch
and
griffinberg
and
the
beltons
to
be
aware
that
they
would
come
down
to
the
lakes
at
this
time
of
the
year
unless
there
was
something
worth
coming
for
something
and
a
pretty
good
sum
to
be
made
sir
stephen
looked
down
at
the
floor
for
a
moment
as
if
he
were
considering
then
he
leant
forward
i
tell
you
he
said
with
an
air
of
decision
and
with
a
return
of
his
usual
coolness
and
aplomb
a
dash
of
colour
rose
to
his
face
his
fine
eyes
grew
bright
he
was
the
man
of
affairs
the
great
financier
again
it
africa
this
time
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
with
a
glance
at
the
door
i
another
treaty
falconer
nodded
i
am
making
for
a
concession
a
charter
from
the
government
falconer
nodded
again
and
i
want
a
railway
from
danville
to
bualbec
his
voice
almost
sank
to
a
whisper
griffinberg
wirsch
and
the
rest
are
with
me
or
nearly
so
i
have
got
them
down
to
clench
the
matter
there
are
millions
in
it
if
i
can
bring
it
off
there
is
what
is
worth
more
than
millions
to
me
falconer
nodded
a
peerage
for
sir
stephen
orme
said
falconer
with
a
grim
smile
for
sir
stephen
orme
boy
said
sir
stephen
with
a
flush
and
a
flash
of
the
dark
eyes
it
is
for
his
sake
that
i
am
making
this
last
throw
for
my
boy
falconer
for
myself
i
am
content
why
should
i
be
but
for
him
ah
well
you
seen
him
you
understand
falconer
leant
back
and
smoked
in
silence
plaistow
is
working
the
colonial
office
the
beltons
are
feeling
their
way
in
the
city
wirsch
but
you
know
how
the
thing
is
done
i
got
them
down
here
that
they
may
work
it
quietly
that
i
may
have
them
under
my
eye
and
the
lords
and
ladies
they
to
have
a
finger
in
the
pie
because
though
they
ca
help
you
in
the
african
business
they
can
in
the
matter
of
the
peerage
sir
stephen
smiled
you
stand
in
with
us
falconer
do
refuse
me
let
me
make
some
reparation
some
atonement
for
the
past
he
rose
and
stood
smiling
an
imposing
figure
with
his
white
hair
and
brilliant
eyes
falconer
got
up
slowly
and
stiffly
thanks
i
think
it
over
it
a
big
thing
as
you
say
and
it
will
either
make
you
or
break
me
said
sir
stephen
but
he
laughed
confidently
falconer
nodded
i
go
up
now
he
said
sir
stephen
went
to
the
door
with
him
and
held
out
his
hand
falconer
he
said
thank
you
for
my
boy
sake
falconer
took
the
warm
hand
in
his
cold
one
and
held
it
for
a
moment
then
dropped
it
he
said
with
a
nod
and
a
sidelong
glance
sir
stephen
went
back
and
poured
himself
out
another
glass
of
brandy
and
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
but
it
would
have
been
one
of
apprehension
if
he
could
have
seen
the
cruel
smile
which
distorted
falconer
face
as
he
went
through
the
exquisitely
beautiful
hall
and
corridors
to
the
luxurious
room
which
had
been
allotted
to
him
there
was
in
the
smile
and
the
cold
glitter
of
the
eyes
the
kind
of
look
which
the
cat
wears
when
it
plays
with
a
mouse
chapter
xii
ida
walked
home
through
the
rain
very
thoughtfully
but
not
sadly
for
though
it
was
still
pelting
in
the
uncompromising
lake
fashion
she
was
half
conscious
of
a
strange
lightness
of
the
heart
a
strange
brightness
in
herself
and
even
in
the
view
which
vaguely
surprised
and
puzzled
her
the
feeling
was
not
vivid
enough
to
be
happiness
but
it
was
the
nearest
thing
to
it
and
without
realising
it
she
thought
all
the
way
home
of
stafford
orme
her
life
had
been
so
secluded
so
solitary
and
friendless
that
he
had
come
into
it
as
a
sudden
and
unexpected
flash
of
sunlight
in
a
drear
november
day
it
seemed
to
her
extraordinary
that
she
should
have
met
him
so
often
still
more
extraordinary
the
offer
he
had
made
that
morning
she
asked
herself
as
she
went
with
quick
light
step
along
the
hills
why
he
had
done
it
why
he
who
was
rich
and
had
so
many
friends
no
doubt
the
villa
would
be
full
of
them
should
find
any
pleasure
in
learning
to
herd
cattle
and
count
sheep
to
ride
about
the
dale
with
only
a
young
girl
for
company
if
anyone
had
whispered
it
is
because
he
prefers
that
young
society
to
any
other
it
is
because
he
wants
to
be
with
you
not
from
any
desire
to
learn
farming
she
would
have
been
more
than
surprised
would
have
received
this
offer
of
a
solution
of
the
mystery
with
a
smile
of
incredulity
for
there
had
been
no
candid
friend
to
tell
her
that
she
possessed
the
fatal
gift
of
beauty
that
she
was
one
of
those
upon
whom
the
eyes
of
man
can
not
look
without
a
stirring
of
the
heart
and
a
quickening
of
the
pulse
vanity
is
a
strong
plant
and
it
flourishes
in
every
soil
but
it
had
found
no
root
in
ida
nature
she
was
too
absorbed
in
the
round
of
her
daily
tasks
in
the
care
of
her
father
and
her
efforts
to
keep
the
great
place
from
going
to
rack
and
ruin
to
think
of
herself
and
if
her
glass
had
ever
whispered
that
she
was
one
of
the
loveliest
of
the
daughters
of
eve
she
had
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
it
no
she
assured
herself
that
it
was
just
a
whim
of
orme
a
passing
fancy
and
caprice
which
would
soon
be
satisfied
and
that
he
would
tire
of
it
after
a
few
days
perhaps
hours
of
course
she
was
wrong
to
humour
the
whim
but
it
had
been
hard
to
refuse
him
hard
to
seem
churlish
and
obstinate
after
he
had
been
so
kind
on
the
night
her
father
had
frightened
her
by
his
and
it
had
been
still
harder
because
she
had
been
conscious
of
a
certain
pleasure
in
the
thought
that
she
should
see
him
again
for
the
first
time
as
she
went
into
the
great
silent
house
she
realised
how
lonely
her
life
was
how
drear
and
uneventful
now
and
again
while
cantering
along
the
roads
on
the
big
chestnut
she
had
met
other
girls
riding
and
driving
the
vaynes
the
avorys
and
the
bannerdales
had
heard
them
talking
and
laughing
merrily
and
happily
but
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
to
envy
them
to
reflect
that
she
was
different
to
other
girls
who
had
friends
and
companions
and
girlish
amusements
she
had
been
quite
content
until
now
and
even
now
she
was
not
discontented
but
this
acquaintanceship
which
had
sprung
up
so
strangely
between
her
and
orme
was
like
the
touch
of
a
warm
hand
stretched
out
from
the
great
world
and
its
sudden
warmth
awoke
her
to
the
coldness
the
dreariness
of
her
life
as
she
entered
the
hall
jessie
came
in
by
the
back
door
with
her
apron
full
of
eggs
i
saw
you
come
in
miss
ida
so
i
thought
i
just
bring
you
these
to
show
you
they
laying
finely
now
ai
they
ida
looked
round
from
where
she
stood
going
through
the
form
of
drying
her
thick
but
small
boots
against
the
huge
log
that
glowed
on
the
wide
yes
that
is
a
splendid
lot
jessie
she
said
with
a
smile
you
will
have
some
to
send
to
market
for
the
first
time
this
season
yes
miss
said
jessie
deftly
rolling
the
eggs
into
a
basket
but
i
thinking
there
wo
be
any
need
to
send
them
to
bryndermere
market
jason
just
been
telling
me
that
the
new
folks
up
at
brae
wood
have
been
sending
all
round
the
place
for
eggs
and
butter
and
cream
and
fowls
and
jason
says
that
he
can
get
so
much
better
prices
from
them
than
from
bryndermere
he
was
thinking
that
he
put
aside
all
the
cream
he
could
spare
and
kill
half
a
dozen
of
the
pullets
if
you
object
miss
ida
ida
face
flushed
and
she
looked
fixedly
at
the
fire
something
within
her
protested
against
the
idea
of
selling
the
dairy
produce
to
the
new
people
at
brae
wood
but
she
struggled
against
the
feeling
oh
yes
why
not
jessie
she
said
though
she
knew
well
enough
well
miss
replied
jessie
hesitatingly
and
with
a
questioning
glance
at
her
young
mistress
averted
face
jason
did
know
at
first
he
said
that
selling
the
things
at
the
new
house
was
different
to
sending
to
market
and
that
you
might
like
it
that
you
might
think
it
was
not
becoming
ida
laughed
that
pride
on
jason
part
wicked
pride
jessie
she
said
if
you
sell
your
butter
and
eggs
it
ca
very
much
matter
whether
you
sell
them
at
the
market
or
direct
oh
yes
tell
jason
he
can
let
them
have
anything
we
can
spare
jessie
face
cleared
and
broke
into
a
smile
she
came
of
a
race
that
looks
after
the
pennies
and
loves
a
good
deal
thank
you
miss
she
said
as
if
ida
had
conferred
a
personal
favour
and
they
take
all
we
can
let
have
for
they
a
mortal
sight
of
folk
up
there
at
brae
wood
william
says
that
there
nigh
upon
fifty
bedrooms
and
that
they
all
be
full
his
sister
is
one
of
the
there
a
cook
from
london
quite
the
gentleman
miss
with
rings
on
his
fingers
and
a
piano
in
his
own
room
and
susie
says
that
the
place
is
all
one
mass
of
ivory
and
gold
and
that
some
of
the
rooms
is
like
heaven
or
the
queen
own
rooms
in
windsor
castle
ida
laughed
susie
appears
to
have
an
enviable
acquaintance
with
the
celestial
regions
and
the
abode
of
royalty
jessie
yes
miss
of
course
it
only
what
she
read
about
and
she
says
that
sir
stephen
that
the
gentleman
as
owns
it
all
is
a
kind
of
king
with
his
own
body
servant
and
a
a
i
forget
what
they
call
him
it
a
word
like
a
a
secretary
suggested
ida
yes
that
it
miss
but
that
he
quite
simple
and
and
that
he
as
easily
pleased
as
if
he
were
a
mere
nobody
and
susie
says
that
she
runs
out
after
dinner
and
peeps
into
the
stables
and
that
it
full
of
horses
and
that
there
a
dozen
carriages
some
of
grand
enough
for
the
lord
mayor
of
london
and
that
there
a
head
coachman
and
eight
or
nine
men
and
boys
under
him
i
thinking
miss
ida
that
the
court
the
court
was
the
vaynes
place
or
bannerdale
grange
ai
half
so
grand
i
daresay
said
ida
is
the
lunch
nearly
ready
jessie
yes
miss
i
was
only
waiting
for
you
to
come
in
and
suzie
seen
the
young
orme
sir
stephen
son
and
she
says
that
he
the
handsomest
gentleman
she
ever
saw
and
she
heard
davis
tell
one
of
the
new
hands
that
stafford
was
a
very
great
gentleman
amongst
the
fashionable
people
in
london
and
that
very
likely
he
marry
one
of
the
great
ladies
that
is
coming
down
davis
says
that
a
duchess
would
be
too
fine
for
him
he
stands
so
high
and
yet
susie
says
he
just
as
pleasant
and
easy
as
sir
stephen
and
that
he
says
you
quite
like
a
common
person
but
there
how
foolish
of
me
standing
here
chattering
while
you
wet
through
do
ye
run
up
and
change
while
i
put
the
lunch
on
miss
ida
dear
when
ida
came
down
her
father
was
already
at
the
table
with
his
book
open
at
his
elbow
and
he
scarcely
looked
up
as
she
went
to
her
place
now
as
a
rule
she
gave
him
an
account
of
her
rides
and
walks
and
told
him
about
the
cattle
and
the
progress
of
the
farm
generally
of
how
she
had
seen
a
kingfisher
or
noticed
that
the
trout
were
rising
or
that
she
had
startled
a
covey
of
partridges
in
the
young
wheat
to
all
of
which
he
seemed
scarcely
ever
to
listen
nodding
his
head
now
and
again
and
returning
often
to
his
book
before
she
had
finished
speaking
but
she
could
not
tell
him
of
her
morning
walk
and
her
meeting
with
stafford
orme
she
would
have
liked
to
have
assured
him
that
he
had
done
sir
stephen
an
injustice
in
thinking
him
guilty
of
buying
the
brae
wood
land
in
an
underhand
way
but
she
knew
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
do
so
for
once
an
idea
had
got
into
heron
head
it
was
difficult
to
destroy
it
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
too
she
was
concealing
something
from
him
once
or
twice
she
tried
to
say
father
the
gentleman
who
was
fishing
on
the
river
was
sir
stephen
orme
son
i
have
met
him
two
or
three
times
since
and
he
has
asked
me
to
meet
him
but
she
could
not
she
knew
he
would
fly
into
one
of
the
passions
in
which
he
could
not
be
persuaded
to
listen
to
reason
and
that
he
would
insist
upon
the
breaking
off
of
her
acquaintance
with
orme
and
there
was
so
much
pain
in
the
mere
thought
of
it
that
her
courage
failed
her
if
she
were
not
to
meet
him
or
if
she
met
him
and
told
him
that
she
could
not
remain
with
him
must
not
speak
to
him
again
it
would
be
tantamount
to
telling
him
that
she
did
not
believe
his
father
was
innocent
and
she
did
believe
it
though
she
knew
so
little
of
orme
she
felt
that
she
could
trust
him
so
she
sat
almost
silent
thinking
of
what
jessie
had
told
her
and
wondering
why
stafford
orme
should
leave
the
gay
party
at
the
villa
to
ride
with
her
once
only
in
the
course
of
the
meal
did
her
father
speak
he
looked
up
suddenly
with
a
quick
almost
cunning
glance
and
said
can
you
let
me
have
some
money
ida
i
want
to
order
some
books
there
a
copy
of
the
percy
in
the
catalogue
i
should
like
to
buy
how
much
is
it
father
she
asked
oh
five
pounds
will
do
he
said
vaguely
there
are
one
or
two
other
books
she
made
a
hasty
calculation
five
pounds
was
a
large
sum
to
her
but
she
smiled
as
she
said
you
are
very
extravagant
dear
there
is
already
a
copy
of
the
in
the
library
he
looked
confused
for
a
moment
then
he
said
but
not
with
these
notes
not
with
these
notes
they
valuable
and
the
book
is
cheap
very
well
dear
she
responded
and
she
went
to
the
antique
bureau
and
unlocking
it
took
a
note
from
a
cedar
box
he
watched
her
covertly
with
a
painful
eagerness
i
suppose
you
have
a
large
nest
egg
there
eh
ida
he
remarked
with
a
quavering
laugh
no
a
very
little
one
she
responded
nearly
enough
to
pay
the
quarterly
bills
but
never
mind
dear
there
it
is
you
must
show
me
the
books
when
they
come
i
never
saw
the
last
you
ordered
you
know
he
took
the
note
with
an
assumption
of
indifference
but
with
a
gleam
of
satisfaction
in
his
sunken
eyes
did
you
he
said
i
must
have
forgotten
you
always
so
busy
but
i
show
you
these
if
you
remind
me
you
must
be
careful
of
the
money
ida
you
must
keep
down
the
expenses
we
poor
very
poor
you
know
and
the
cost
of
living
and
servants
is
very
great
very
great
he
wandered
off
to
the
library
muttering
to
himself
with
his
book
under
his
arm
and
the
note
gripped
tightly
in
the
hand
which
he
had
thrust
into
the
pocket
of
his
and
ida
as
she
put
on
her
habit
and
went
into
the
to
have
the
colt
saddled
sighed
as
she
thought
that
it
would
be
nice
to
have
just
for
once
enough
money
to
meet
all
the
bills
and
buy
all
the
books
her
father
coveted
but
her
melancholy
was
not
of
long
duration
the
colt
was
in
high
spirits
and
the
task
of
impressing
him
with
the
fact
that
he
had
now
reached
a
responsible
age
and
must
behave
like
a
horse
with
something
else
before
him
in
life
than
kicking
up
his
heels
in
the
paddock
soon
drove
the
thought
of
their
poverty
from
her
mind
and
sent
the
blood
leaping
warmly
and
wildly
in
her
veins
she
spent
the
afternoon
in
breaking
in
the
colt
and
succeeded
in
keeping
stafford
orme
out
of
her
thoughts
but
he
slid
into
them
again
as
she
sat
by
the
fire
after
dinner
the
nights
are
often
cool
in
the
dales
all
through
early
summer
and
recalled
the
earnestness
in
his
handsome
face
when
he
pleaded
to
be
allowed
to
help
her
she
sat
up
for
some
little
time
after
her
father
had
gone
to
bed
and
as
usual
she
paused
outside
his
door
and
listened
all
was
quiet
then
but
as
she
was
brushing
her
hair
she
thought
she
heard
his
door
open
she
laid
down
the
brush
and
stood
battling
with
the
sudden
fear
which
possessed
her
then
she
stole
out
on
to
the
corridor
the
old
man
was
standing
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
as
if
about
to
descend
and
though
she
could
not
see
his
face
she
knew
that
he
was
asleep
she
glided
to
him
noiselessly
and
put
her
hand
upon
his
arm
softly
he
turned
his
sightless
eyes
upon
her
evidently
without
seeing
her
and
fighting
against
the
desire
to
cry
out
she
led
him
gently
back
to
his
room
he
woke
as
they
crossed
the
threshold
woke
and
looked
at
her
in
a
stupefied
fashion
are
you
ill
father
is
there
anything
you
want
she
asked
as
calmly
as
she
could
no
he
replied
i
am
quite
well
i
do
not
want
anything
i
was
going
to
bed
why
have
you
called
me
she
remained
with
him
for
a
few
minutes
then
left
the
room
turning
the
key
in
the
door
when
she
had
gone
he
stood
listening
with
his
head
on
one
side
then
he
opened
his
hand
and
looked
with
a
cunning
smile
at
the
note
which
had
been
tightly
grasped
in
it
she
did
see
it
no
she
did
see
it
he
muttered
and
he
went
stealthily
to
the
bed
and
thrust
it
under
the
pillow
chapter
xiii
the
morning
broke
with
that
exquisite
clearness
which
distinguishes
the
lakes
when
a
fine
day
follows
a
wet
one
and
despite
her
anxiety
on
her
father
account
ida
as
she
went
was
conscious
of
that
sense
of
happiness
which
comes
from
anticipation
she
made
her
morning
tour
of
inspection
of
the
stables
and
the
dairy
and
ordered
the
big
chestnut
to
be
saddled
directly
after
breakfast
when
her
father
came
down
she
was
relieved
to
find
that
he
seemed
to
be
in
his
usual
health
and
in
answer
to
her
question
whether
he
had
slept
well
he
replied
in
the
affirmative
and
was
mildly
surprised
that
she
should
enquire
directly
he
had
gone
off
to
the
library
she
ran
upstairs
to
put
on
her
habit
for
the
first
time
she
was
struck
by
its
shabbiness
she
had
never
given
a
thought
to
it
before
her
though
plain
and
inexpensive
were
always
dainty
and
fresh
but
she
wore
her
habit
as
long
as
it
would
hold
together
and
cared
nothing
for
the
fact
that
her
hat
was
stained
by
the
rain
they
were
her
working
clothes
and
strictly
considered
as
such
but
this
morning
she
surveyed
the
skirt
ruefully
and
thought
of
the
trim
and
apparently
always
new
habits
which
the
bannerdale
girls
wore
and
she
brushed
it
with
a
care
which
it
had
never
yet
received
as
a
rule
she
wore
a
black
scarf
or
none
at
all
but
as
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
she
was
not
satisfied
and
she
found
a
scarlet
tie
which
she
had
bought
in
a
fit
of
extravagance
and
put
it
on
the
touch
of
colour
heightened
the
beauty
of
her
clear
ivory
face
and
brightened
up
the
old
habit
but
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
with
something
like
shamefacedness
why
was
she
so
anxious
about
her
appearance
this
morning
of
all
the
mornings
for
an
instant
she
was
tempted
to
snatch
off
the
tie
but
in
the
end
she
let
it
remain
and
she
brushed
the
soft
tendrils
of
her
hair
at
her
forehead
with
unusual
care
before
she
fastened
on
her
hat
her
father
was
walking
up
and
down
the
terrace
slowly
as
she
came
out
and
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
her
absently
i
shall
probably
ride
into
bryndermere
father
she
said
shall
i
post
your
letters
i
know
you
will
be
anxious
for
that
one
to
the
to
go
she
added
with
a
smile
his
eyes
dropped
and
he
seemed
disconcerted
for
a
minute
then
he
said
no
no
i
send
it
by
jason
i
not
written
it
yet
and
he
turned
away
from
her
and
resumed
his
pacing
to
and
fro
ida
went
to
the
and
got
on
to
rupert
by
the
aid
of
the
stone
mounting
block
from
which
charles
the
second
had
climbed
laughingly
to
the
white
horse
which
figures
in
so
many
pictures
of
the
merry
monarch
and
rode
out
of
the
watched
with
pride
by
jason
before
she
had
gone
far
he
ran
after
her
if
you
riding
by
west
hill
miss
ida
perhaps
you
look
at
the
there
williams
says
that
the
roof
falling
in
very
well
she
called
back
in
her
clear
voice
oh
and
miss
ida
there
a
big
stone
washed
out
of
the
weir
thinking
it
ought
to
be
put
back
or
we
have
the
meadows
above
flooded
this
winter
she
laughed
and
nodded
and
put
rupert
to
a
trot
for
she
knew
that
while
she
was
within
hearing
jason
would
bombard
her
with
similar
tales
of
woe
not
a
slate
slid
from
the
old
roof
of
the
hall
or
a
sheep
fell
lame
but
the
matter
was
referred
to
her
she
rode
down
the
road
in
the
sunlight
the
big
chestnut
moving
under
her
as
if
he
were
on
springs
and
she
were
a
feather
and
half
unconsciously
she
began
to
hum
an
air
not
one
of
those
modern
ones
one
hears
in
many
but
an
melody
which
she
had
found
in
an
ancient
in
the
antique
cabinet
beside
the
grand
piano
she
left
the
road
where
it
touched
the
wild
moorland
of
the
valley
and
rupert
broke
into
a
canter
donald
and
bess
settling
into
the
stride
with
which
they
managed
to
keep
up
with
the
big
horse
she
had
resolved
that
she
would
not
ride
straight
to
the
stream
and
she
kept
up
the
but
her
eyes
wandered
to
the
road
expectantly
now
and
again
but
there
was
no
sign
of
a
horseman
and
after
half
an
hour
had
passed
a
sense
of
disappointment
rose
within
her
it
was
quite
possible
that
he
had
forgotten
the
engagement
perhaps
on
reflection
he
had
seen
that
she
was
quite
right
in
her
objections
to
his
strange
proposal
and
he
would
not
come
a
faint
flush
rose
to
her
face
and
she
turned
rupert
and
rode
up
and
over
the
hill
where
she
could
not
see
the
road
but
she
had
no
sooner
got
on
top
than
she
remembered
that
no
time
had
been
mentioned
or
if
it
had
that
she
had
forgotten
it
she
turned
and
rode
up
the
hill
again
and
looking
down
saw
stafford
riding
along
the
valley
in
desperate
haste
and
yet
looking
about
him
uncertainly
her
heart
beat
with
a
quickened
pulse
sending
the
delicate
colour
into
her
face
and
she
pulled
up
and
leaning
forward
with
her
chin
in
her
hand
watched
him
dreamily
he
rode
a
heavier
horse
than
adonis
and
he
had
made
a
change
in
his
dress
in
place
of
the
which
had
smacked
of
london
and
hyde
park
he
wore
a
rough
but
light
coat
thick
cord
breeches
and
brown
leather
gaiters
she
smiled
as
she
knew
that
he
had
tried
to
make
himself
look
as
much
like
a
farmer
as
possible
but
no
farmer
in
the
dales
had
that
peculiar
air
of
birth
and
breeding
which
distinguished
stafford
orme
the
air
which
his
father
had
been
so
quick
to
detect
and
to
be
proud
of
she
noticed
how
well
he
sat
the
great
horse
with
what
ease
and
hands
he
rode
over
the
rough
and
treacherous
ground
suddenly
he
turned
his
head
and
saw
her
and
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
came
galloping
up
to
her
with
a
smile
of
relief
and
gladness
on
his
handsome
face
as
he
spoke
to
the
dogs
who
clamoured
round
him
i
was
so
afraid
i
had
missed
you
he
said
i
am
late
am
i
not
some
people
kept
me
after
breakfast
you
are
not
late
i
do
think
any
time
was
mentioned
she
responded
quickly
though
her
heart
was
beating
with
a
strange
and
novel
sensation
of
pleasure
in
his
presence
i
scarcely
expected
you
he
looked
at
her
reproachfully
not
expect
me
but
why
i
thought
you
might
change
your
mind
she
said
he
checked
a
quick
response
and
said
instead
and
now
where
do
we
go
first
you
see
i
have
got
a
bit
heavier
horse
he
a
present
also
from
my
father
what
do
you
think
of
him
she
eyed
him
gravely
and
critically
he
she
said
but
i
do
like
him
so
well
as
the
one
you
rode
yesterday
did
i
see
him
slip
just
now
coming
up
the
hill
did
he
said
stafford
i
did
notice
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
so
delighted
at
seeing
you
that
i
do
think
i
should
have
noticed
if
he
had
tumbled
on
his
nose
oh
it
was
much
of
a
slip
she
said
quickly
to
cover
her
slight
confusion
at
his
candid
confession
shall
we
go
down
to
the
sheep
first
anywhere
you
like
he
assented
brightly
remember
i
your
pupil
she
glanced
at
him
and
smiled
a
very
big
pupil
but
a
very
humble
one
he
said
i
afraid
you
add
very
stupid
one
before
long
as
they
rode
down
hill
stafford
stole
a
look
at
her
unobserved
ever
since
he
had
left
her
yesterday
her
face
had
haunted
him
even
while
maude
falconer
in
all
her
war
paint
and
sparkling
with
jewels
had
been
singing
even
in
the
silent
watches
of
the
night
when
strange
thing
for
him
he
had
awakened
from
a
dream
of
her
he
had
recalled
the
exquisitely
lovely
face
with
its
grave
yet
girlish
eyes
and
he
felt
now
with
a
thrill
that
she
was
even
more
lovely
than
she
had
been
in
his
thoughts
and
his
dreams
that
the
nameless
charm
which
had
haunted
him
was
stronger
more
subtle
than
even
his
fancy
had
painted
it
he
noticed
the
touch
of
colour
just
below
her
white
slender
column
of
a
neck
and
wondered
why
no
other
woman
had
ever
thought
of
wearing
a
crimson
tie
with
her
habit
what
a
grand
morning
he
said
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
a
morning
like
this
so
clear
and
bright
those
hills
there
look
as
though
they
were
quite
near
it
the
rain
she
explained
it
seems
to
wash
the
atmosphere
my
father
says
there
is
only
one
other
place
which
has
this
particular
clearness
and
brightness
after
rain
and
that
ireland
there
are
the
sheep
now
she
smiled
do
you
know
how
to
count
them
he
stared
at
her
you
begin
at
number
one
i
suppose
he
said
she
smiled
but
where
is
number
one
she
spoke
to
donald
in
a
low
voice
then
the
collie
began
to
work
the
sheep
up
into
a
heap
bess
assisting
with
her
sharp
yap
now
they
ready
said
ida
you
must
be
quick
stafford
began
to
count
but
the
sheep
moved
and
the
ones
he
had
counted
got
mixed
up
with
the
others
and
he
began
again
and
yet
again
until
he
turned
with
a
puzzled
and
furrowed
brow
i
ca
count
them
he
said
they
wo
keep
still
for
a
single
moment
she
turned
to
him
with
a
smile
there
are
she
said
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
counted
them
already
he
exclaimed
yes
i
could
have
counted
them
twice
over
by
this
time
now
begin
again
and
begin
from
the
farthest
row
and
remember
when
you
come
to
a
black
one
keep
your
eye
on
that
one
and
start
again
front
him
quite
easy
when
you
know
how
he
began
again
i
make
it
she
shook
her
head
and
laughed
that
would
be
four
missing
and
we
should
have
to
hunt
for
them
but
they
are
all
there
try
again
he
tried
and
made
it
did
i
tell
you
that
i
was
an
idiot
he
said
in
despair
oh
you
ca
expect
to
learn
the
first
time
she
said
consolingly
it
was
weeks
before
i
could
do
it
and
i
almost
cried
the
first
few
times
i
tried
they
would
move
just
as
i
was
finishing
oh
well
then
i
can
hope
to
get
it
in
time
he
said
did
it
ever
strike
you
that
though
we
think
ourselves
jolly
clever
that
there
are
heaps
of
things
which
a
workingman
the
men
we
look
down
upon
can
do
which
we
could
accomplish
if
it
were
to
save
our
lives
for
instance
i
could
make
a
horseshoe
if
my
existence
depended
upon
it
and
yet
it
looks
as
easy
as
counting
sheep
she
finished
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eyes
just
so
he
said
with
a
laugh
shall
i
have
another
try
oh
no
you
be
here
all
day
and
we
got
to
see
if
the
others
are
all
right
but
first
i
think
we
better
go
and
look
at
the
weir
jason
says
that
a
stone
has
got
washed
down
and
that
means
that
when
the
autumn
rains
come
the
meadows
would
be
flooded
all
right
i
ready
he
said
with
bright
alacrity
i
enjoying
this
i
know
now
why
you
look
so
happy
and
contented
you
of
some
use
in
the
world
and
i
the
rest
of
us
that
the
weir
he
broke
off
to
enquire
as
they
came
in
sight
of
a
rude
barrier
of
stones
which
partially
checked
the
stream
that
is
it
she
said
and
jason
is
right
some
of
the
big
stones
have
been
washed
down
what
a
nuisance
we
shall
have
to
get
some
men
from
bryndermere
to
put
them
up
again
stafford
rode
up
to
the
weir
and
looked
at
it
critically
thank
heaven
i
have
got
to
count
the
stones
he
said
if
kindly
hold
my
horse
he
not
so
well
trained
as
yours
and
would
bolt
i
afraid
he
slipped
from
the
saddle
as
he
spoke
and
she
caught
the
reins
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
asked
i
do
know
yet
stafford
called
back
as
he
waded
into
the
river
she
held
the
horse
and
sat
reposeful
in
the
saddle
and
watched
him
with
a
smile
upon
her
face
but
it
grew
suddenly
grave
as
she
saw
stafford
stoop
and
put
his
arms
round
one
of
the
fallen
stones
and
she
cried
to
him
oh
you
ca
lift
them
it
no
use
trying
stafford
apparently
did
not
hear
her
for
exerting
all
his
strength
he
lifted
the
big
stone
and
gradually
slid
and
hoisted
it
into
its
place
then
he
attacked
the
other
two
and
with
a
still
greater
effort
raised
them
into
a
line
with
their
fellows
ida
watched
him
as
well
as
one
watches
some
strong
man
going
through
his
performance
it
was
a
incredible
feat
and
she
held
her
breath
as
one
stone
followed
the
other
it
seemed
to
her
incredible
and
impossible
because
stafford
figure
was
slight
and
graceful
and
he
performed
the
feat
with
the
apparent
ease
which
he
had
learnt
in
the
athletic
sports
the
colour
rose
to
her
face
and
her
heart
beat
quickly
there
is
one
thing
left
for
women
to
worship
and
they
worship
it
readily
and
that
is
strength
stafford
could
not
count
sheep
any
woman
could
do
that
but
he
could
do
what
no
woman
could
do
lift
those
great
stones
into
their
places
so
that
as
he
waded
out
of
the
river
she
smiled
him
instead
of
him
which
is
a
very
different
thing
as
she
said
how
strong
you
must
be
i
should
have
thought
it
would
have
required
two
or
three
men
to
lift
those
stones
oh
it
easy
enough
as
easy
as
counting
sheep
when
you
know
how
she
laughed
but
you
must
be
very
wet
she
said
glancing
at
the
water
as
it
dripped
from
his
clothes
oh
it
all
in
the
day
work
he
said
cheerfully
more
than
cheerfully
happily
now
for
the
steers
they
in
the
dale
she
said
and
she
looked
at
him
as
she
spoke
with
a
new
interest
with
the
interest
a
woman
feels
in
the
presence
of
her
master
of
the
man
who
can
move
mountains
he
shook
the
water
from
him
and
rode
at
her
side
more
cheerfully
than
he
had
done
hitherto
for
he
had
so
to
speak
proved
his
helpfulness
he
might
be
an
idiot
but
he
could
lift
weir
stones
into
their
place
there
they
are
she
said
and
oh
dear
one
of
them
has
got
loose
there
ought
to
be
fourteen
and
there
are
only
thirteen
good
heavens
you
must
have
eyes
like
a
hawk
she
laughed
oh
no
i
used
to
it
that
is
all
now
where
can
it
be
i
thought
all
the
fences
were
mended
i
must
find
it
stop
he
said
at
any
rate
i
can
find
a
cow
bullock
steer
let
me
go
you
wait
here
he
rode
off
as
he
spoke
and
she
pulled
up
the
big
chestnut
and
looked
after
him
once
more
the
question
rose
to
perplex
her
why
had
he
come
why
was
he
riding
about
the
dale
with
her
counting
sheep
wading
in
the
stream
lifting
weir
stones
and
herding
cattle
it
seemed
to
be
so
strange
so
inexplicable
and
as
she
followed
him
with
her
eyes
his
grace
and
strength
were
impressed
upon
her
and
she
dwelt
upon
them
dreamily
were
there
many
such
men
in
the
world
of
which
she
knew
so
little
or
was
he
one
alone
and
unique
and
how
good
how
pleasant
it
was
to
have
him
with
her
to
talk
to
her
to
help
her
she
had
often
longed
for
a
brother
and
had
pictured
one
like
this
strong
and
handsome
with
frank
eyes
and
smiling
lips
someone
upon
whom
she
could
lean
to
whom
she
could
go
when
she
was
in
trouble
a
shout
awoke
her
from
her
reverie
and
looking
up
she
saw
the
missing
steer
forcing
its
way
through
a
hedge
on
top
of
a
bank
stafford
was
riding
after
it
at
an
easy
canter
and
coming
straight
for
the
bank
the
steer
plunged
through
the
hedge
and
floundered
through
the
wide
ditch
and
ida
headed
it
and
drove
it
towards
the
rest
of
the
herd
then
she
turned
in
her
saddle
to
warn
stafford
of
the
ditch
but
as
she
turned
he
was
close
upon
the
bank
and
she
saw
the
big
hunter
rise
for
the
leap
a
doubt
as
to
how
he
would
land
rose
in
her
mind
and
she
swung
rupert
round
and
as
she
did
so
she
saw
the
hunter
crash
through
the
hedge
stumble
at
the
ditch
and
fall
lurching
forward
on
its
edge
no
man
alive
could
have
kept
his
seat
and
stafford
came
off
like
a
stone
thrown
from
a
catapult
and
lay
face
downwards
in
the
long
wet
grass
something
like
a
hot
iron
shot
through
ida
heart
and
sent
her
face
white
and
she
rode
up
to
him
and
flung
herself
from
rupert
and
knelt
beside
the
prostrate
form
he
lay
quite
still
and
she
knew
quite
well
what
had
happened
that
he
had
fallen
on
his
head
and
stunned
himself
she
remembered
at
that
moment
that
she
herself
had
once
so
fallen
but
the
remembrance
did
nothing
to
soften
her
present
anxiety
she
knelt
beside
him
and
lifted
his
head
on
her
knee
and
his
white
face
smote
her
accusingly
he
was
still
motionless
so
long
that
she
began
to
fear
was
he
dead
she
asked
herself
the
question
with
a
heavy
pulsation
of
the
heart
with
a
sense
of
irrevocable
loss
if
he
was
dead
then
then
what
had
she
lost
trembling
in
every
limb
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
heart
it
beat
but
slowly
reluctantly
she
looked
round
her
with
a
sense
of
helplessness
she
had
never
been
placed
in
such
a
position
before
not
far
from
her
was
a
mountain
rill
and
she
ran
to
it
with
unsteady
steps
and
soaked
her
handkerchief
in
it
and
bathed
the
white
smooth
forehead
even
at
that
moment
she
noticed
half
unconsciously
the
patrician
features
the
delicate
lines
of
the
handsome
face
he
had
come
to
this
mishap
in
his
attempt
to
help
her
he
was
dying
perhaps
in
her
service
a
thrill
ran
through
her
a
thrill
that
moved
her
as
by
an
uncontrollable
impulse
to
bend
still
lower
over
him
so
that
her
lips
almost
touched
his
unconscious
ones
their
nearness
the
intent
gaze
of
her
eyes
now
dark
as
violets
seemed
to
make
themselves
felt
by
him
seemed
by
some
mysterious
power
to
call
him
back
from
the
of
unconsciousness
he
moved
and
opened
his
eyes
she
started
and
the
colour
flooded
her
face
as
if
her
lips
had
quite
touched
his
and
her
eyes
grew
heavy
as
breathing
painfully
she
waited
for
him
to
entirely
recover
his
intelligence
and
to
speak
the
steer
he
said
at
last
feebly
she
moistened
her
lips
and
looked
away
from
him
as
if
she
were
afraid
lest
he
should
see
what
was
in
her
eyes
the
steer
is
all
right
but
but
you
he
forced
a
laugh
oh
i
all
right
too
he
said
he
looked
around
hazily
i
must
have
come
a
smasher
over
that
bank
then
he
saw
that
he
was
lying
with
his
head
upon
her
knee
and
with
a
hot
flush
the
man
shame
for
his
weakness
in
the
presence
of
a
woman
he
struggled
into
a
sitting
posture
and
looked
at
her
looked
at
her
with
the
forced
cheerfulness
of
a
man
who
has
come
an
unforeseen
unexpected
cropper
of
the
first
magnitude
it
was
my
fault
you
you
were
right
about
the
horse
he
ought
not
to
have
slipped
where
my
hat
oh
here
it
is
the
horse
is
lame
i
hope
no
she
said
setting
her
teeth
in
her
great
effort
to
appear
calm
and
unmoved
he
is
standing
beside
rupert
she
had
got
thus
far
when
her
voice
broke
and
she
turned
her
face
away
quickly
but
not
so
quickly
that
he
did
not
see
her
exceeding
pallor
the
heavy
droop
of
the
lids
the
sweep
of
the
dark
lashes
on
her
white
cheek
why
what
the
matter
miss
heron
he
asked
anxiously
and
with
all
a
man
obtuseness
did
happen
to
come
to
grief
in
any
way
i
did
fall
on
you
or
anything
i
she
tried
to
laugh
tried
to
laugh
scornfully
for
indeed
she
was
filled
with
scorn
for
this
sudden
inexplicable
weakness
a
weakness
which
had
never
assailed
her
before
in
all
her
life
a
weakness
which
filled
her
breast
with
rage
but
from
under
the
closed
lids
two
tears
crept
and
rolled
down
her
cheek
and
against
her
will
she
made
confession
of
this
same
foolish
weakness
it
is
nothing
i
am
very
foolish
but
i
i
thought
you
were
badly
hurt
for
the
moment
that
you
might
even
be
killed
he
staggered
to
his
feet
and
caught
her
hand
and
held
it
looking
at
her
with
that
look
in
a
man
eyes
which
is
stronger
and
fiercer
than
fire
and
yet
softer
than
water
the
look
which
goes
straight
to
a
woman
heart
and
you
cared
cared
so
much
he
said
in
a
voice
so
low
that
she
could
scarcely
hear
it
hushed
by
the
awe
and
wonder
of
passion
she
tried
to
withdraw
her
hand
biting
her
lips
setting
them
tightly
in
her
battle
for
calmness
and
her
old
and
indifference
but
he
held
the
small
hand
firmly
felt
it
quiver
and
tremble
saw
the
violet
eyes
raised
to
his
with
a
troubled
wonder
in
them
and
her
name
sprang
to
his
lips
ida
he
breathed
chapter
xiv
ida
the
name
had
sprung
from
his
lips
from
his
heart
almost
unconsciously
it
did
not
seem
strange
to
him
for
he
knew
as
he
spoke
it
that
he
had
called
her
so
in
his
thoughts
that
it
had
hovered
on
his
lips
ever
since
he
had
heard
it
but
to
her
who
shall
describe
the
subtle
emotion
which
thrills
through
a
girl
heart
when
she
hears
for
the
first
time
from
a
strange
man
lips
the
name
whose
use
hitherto
has
been
reserved
for
her
kith
and
kin
she
stood
erect
but
with
her
head
bent
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
the
name
his
voice
ringing
in
her
ears
her
heart
was
beating
almost
painfully
as
if
with
weight
of
a
novel
kind
of
fear
that
yet
was
not
altogether
fear
stafford
looked
at
her
with
the
man
the
eagerness
but
her
face
told
him
nothing
she
was
so
ignorant
of
the
very
a
b
c
of
love
that
there
was
no
start
of
surprise
no
word
or
movement
which
might
guide
him
but
his
instant
thought
was
that
she
was
offended
angry
forgive
me
he
said
you
are
angry
because
i
called
you
ida
it
was
wrong
and
presumptuous
but
i
have
learned
to
think
of
you
by
your
name
and
it
slipped
out
are
you
very
angry
ah
you
knew
why
i
called
you
so
do
you
know
that
i
love
you
she
raised
her
eyes
for
a
moment
but
did
not
look
at
him
they
were
fixed
dreamily
on
the
great
hills
in
the
distance
then
drooped
again
and
her
brows
came
together
her
lips
straightened
with
a
still
more
marked
expression
of
trouble
doubt
and
wonder
i
love
you
he
said
with
the
deep
note
of
a
man
passion
in
his
voice
i
did
mean
to
tell
you
to
speak
i
did
know
until
just
now
how
it
was
with
me
you
see
i
am
telling
you
everything
the
whole
truth
you
will
listen
to
me
for
she
had
made
a
movement
of
turning
away
a
slow
heavy
gesture
as
if
she
were
encumbered
by
chains
as
if
she
were
under
some
spell
from
which
she
could
not
wake
i
will
tell
you
everything
at
the
risk
of
making
you
angry
at
the
risk
of
your
sending
me
away
he
paused
for
a
moment
as
if
he
were
choosing
his
words
with
a
care
that
sprang
from
his
fear
lest
he
should
indeed
rouse
her
anger
and
lose
her
the
first
day
i
saw
you
you
remember
as
if
she
could
forget
she
knew
as
he
asked
the
question
that
no
trifling
detail
of
that
first
meeting
was
forgotten
that
every
word
was
engraven
on
her
memory
when
i
saw
you
riding
down
the
hill
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
any
girl
so
beautiful
so
lovely
the
colour
rose
slowly
to
her
face
but
died
away
again
the
least
vain
of
women
is
moved
when
a
man
tells
her
she
is
beautiful
in
his
eyes
at
any
rate
and
when
you
spoke
to
me
i
thought
i
had
never
heard
so
sweet
a
voice
and
if
i
had
that
there
had
never
been
one
that
i
so
longed
to
hear
again
you
were
not
with
me
long
only
a
few
minutes
but
when
i
left
you
and
trumped
over
the
hill
to
the
inn
i
could
not
get
you
out
of
my
mind
i
wondered
who
you
were
and
whether
i
should
see
you
again
the
horses
moved
and
instinctively
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
towards
them
they
will
not
go
they
are
quite
quiet
he
said
wait
ah
wait
for
a
few
minutes
i
have
a
feeling
that
if
i
let
you
go
i
shall
not
see
you
again
and
that
would
that
would
be
more
than
i
could
bear
that
night
at
the
inn
the
landlord
told
me
about
you
of
course
he
had
nothing
but
praise
and
admiration
for
you
who
would
have
any
other
but
he
told
me
of
the
lonely
life
you
led
of
the
care
you
took
of
your
father
of
your
devotion
and
goodness
and
the
picture
of
you
living
at
the
great
silent
house
without
friends
or
companions
well
it
haunted
me
i
could
see
it
all
so
plainly
i
who
am
not
usually
quick
at
seeing
things
as
a
rule
i
not
impressed
by
women
howard
says
i
am
cold
and
bored
perhaps
he
right
but
i
could
not
get
you
out
of
my
mind
i
felt
that
i
wanted
to
see
you
again
he
paused
again
as
if
the
state
of
mind
he
was
describing
was
a
puzzle
to
himself
paused
and
frowned
i
left
the
inn
and
started
up
the
road
i
suppose
i
wanted
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
house
in
which
you
lived
yes
that
must
have
been
it
and
then
all
at
once
i
saw
you
i
remember
the
frock
you
wore
that
night
you
looked
like
an
angel
a
spirit
standing
there
in
the
moonlight
the
most
beautiful
woman
i
have
ever
seen
are
you
angry
with
me
for
saying
so
do
be
for
i
got
to
tell
you
everything
and
and
it
difficult
he
was
silent
a
moment
her
head
was
still
her
small
white
hand
hung
at
her
side
she
was
quite
motionless
but
for
the
slow
rhythmic
rise
and
fall
of
her
bosom
when
you
came
to
me
when
you
spoke
to
me
my
heart
leapt
as
if
well
as
if
something
good
had
happened
to
me
something
that
had
never
happened
before
when
i
went
away
the
picture
of
you
standing
at
the
door
waving
your
hand
went
with
me
and
stayed
with
me
i
could
not
get
you
out
of
my
mind
could
think
of
nothing
else
even
in
the
meeting
with
my
father
whom
i
had
seen
for
so
long
the
thought
of
you
kept
with
me
i
tried
to
get
rid
of
it
to
forget
you
but
it
was
of
no
use
sleeping
and
waking
you
were
with
me
his
voice
grew
almost
harsh
in
its
intensity
and
the
hand
that
had
hung
so
stilly
beside
her
closed
on
the
skirt
of
her
dress
in
her
effort
to
keep
the
hot
blush
from
her
face
when
i
rode
out
the
next
day
it
was
only
with
the
hope
of
seeing
you
it
seemed
to
me
there
was
only
one
thing
i
wanted
to
see
you
again
to
look
into
your
eyes
to
hear
you
speak
all
that
i
had
heard
about
you
well
i
dwelt
upon
it
and
i
felt
that
i
must
help
you
it
seemed
as
if
fate
chance
oh
i
do
know
what
to
call
it
had
me
to
help
you
and
when
i
saw
you
ah
well
i
ca
expect
you
to
understand
what
i
felt
he
stopped
again
as
if
he
himself
were
trying
to
understand
it
the
feeling
that
fate
had
something
to
do
with
it
you
see
it
was
quite
by
chance
i
started
fishing
that
afternoon
that
i
saw
you
at
the
house
gave
me
courage
to
ask
you
to
let
me
help
you
it
sounded
ridiculous
to
you
of
course
it
did
but
if
you
only
knew
how
much
it
meant
to
me
it
meant
that
i
should
see
you
again
perhaps
every
day
for
for
a
long
time
ah
well
it
meant
just
life
and
death
to
me
and
now
his
breath
came
fast
his
eyes
dwelt
upon
her
with
passionate
eagerness
but
he
forced
himself
to
speak
calmly
than
he
might
not
frighten
her
from
his
side
might
not
lose
her
now
the
truth
has
come
upon
me
quite
suddenly
it
was
just
now
when
i
saw
that
you
cared
what
had
happened
to
me
cared
if
i
were
hurt
oh
i
know
it
was
just
because
you
were
frightened
it
was
just
a
woman
pity
for
a
fellow
that
had
come
to
harm
the
fear
lest
i
had
broken
any
bones
but
ah
it
showed
me
my
heart
it
told
me
how
much
i
loved
you
yes
i
love
you
you
are
all
the
world
to
me
nothing
else
matters
her
lips
quivered
but
she
did
not
speak
and
the
look
of
trouble
of
doubt
did
not
leave
her
face
he
waited
his
eyes
seeking
hers
seeking
them
for
some
sign
which
might
still
the
passion
of
fear
and
suspense
with
which
he
was
battling
then
he
said
in
a
low
voice
that
thrilled
with
the
tempest
of
emotion
which
raged
under
his
forced
calm
will
you
not
speak
to
me
are
you
angry
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
him
a
strange
look
from
so
young
a
girl
it
was
as
if
she
were
fighting
against
the
subtle
spell
of
his
words
the
demand
for
her
love
which
shone
in
his
eyes
no
i
am
not
angry
she
said
at
last
and
her
voice
though
very
low
was
calm
and
unshaken
he
made
a
movement
towards
her
but
she
shrank
back
only
a
little
but
perceptibly
and
he
checked
the
movement
the
desire
to
take
her
in
his
arms
you
are
not
angry
then
ida
i
may
call
you
so
you
do
mind
my
loving
you
dearest
will
you
love
me
just
a
little
in
return
wait
for
she
had
shrunk
again
this
time
more
plainly
do
do
answer
without
thinking
i
know
i
have
startled
you
that
i
ought
not
to
have
spoken
so
soon
while
you
only
know
so
little
of
me
you
naturally
say
and
send
me
away
but
if
you
think
you
can
like
me
learn
to
love
me
he
took
her
hand
hanging
so
temptingly
near
his
own
but
she
drew
it
away
no
do
touch
me
she
said
with
a
little
catch
in
her
voice
i
want
to
think
to
understand
she
paused
for
a
moment
her
eyes
still
seeking
the
distant
hills
as
if
in
their
mysterious
heights
she
might
find
something
that
should
explain
this
great
mystery
this
wonderful
thing
that
had
happened
to
her
at
last
with
a
singular
gesture
so
girlish
so
graceful
that
it
made
him
long
still
more
intensely
to
take
her
in
his
arms
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
do
not
know
no
i
do
not
want
you
to
touch
me
please
his
hand
fell
to
his
side
i
ca
answer
you
it
is
so
so
sudden
no
one
has
ever
spoken
to
me
as
you
have
done
he
laughed
from
mere
excess
of
joy
for
her
pure
innocence
her
unlikeness
in
her
ignorance
of
love
and
all
pertaining
to
it
to
the
women
he
knew
made
the
charm
of
her
maddening
to
think
that
he
should
be
the
first
man
to
speak
of
love
to
her
i
am
not
angry
ought
i
to
be
yes
i
suppose
so
we
are
almost
strangers
have
seen
so
little
of
each
other
they
say
that
love
all
true
love
comes
at
first
sight
he
said
in
his
deep
voice
i
used
to
laugh
at
the
idea
but
now
i
know
it
is
true
i
loved
you
the
first
time
i
met
you
ida
her
lip
quivered
and
her
brows
knit
it
seems
so
wonderful
she
said
musingly
i
do
not
understand
it
the
first
time
we
scarcely
spoke
and
i
was
almost
angry
with
you
for
fishing
in
the
heron
and
i
did
did
not
think
of
you
he
made
a
gesture
repudiating
the
mere
idea
is
it
likely
why
should
you
he
said
i
was
just
an
ordinary
man
crossing
your
path
for
the
first
and
perhaps
the
only
time
good
heavens
there
was
no
reason
why
you
should
give
a
thought
to
me
why
i
should
linger
in
your
mind
for
half
a
moment
after
i
was
out
of
your
sight
but
for
me
have
i
told
you
how
beautiful
you
are
ida
you
are
the
loveliest
the
but
even
if
you
had
not
been
i
mean
it
is
not
because
you
are
so
beautiful
that
i
love
you
she
looked
at
him
with
a
puzzled
troubled
look
no
i
ca
explain
see
now
there
not
a
look
of
yours
not
a
feature
that
i
do
know
by
heart
as
if
i
learnt
it
when
i
am
away
from
you
i
can
see
you
see
the
way
your
hair
clusters
in
soft
little
curls
at
your
forehead
the
long
lashes
sweeping
your
cheek
the
the
trick
your
eyes
have
of
turning
from
grey
to
violet
oh
i
know
your
face
by
heart
and
i
it
for
its
beauty
but
if
you
were
to
lose
it
all
if
you
were
not
the
loveliest
creature
god
had
ever
made
it
would
make
no
difference
you
would
still
be
and
it
is
you
i
want
ida
give
yourself
to
me
trust
me
oh
dearest
you
do
know
what
love
is
let
me
teach
you
once
again
he
got
hold
of
her
hand
and
she
let
it
remain
in
his
grasp
but
her
quiescence
did
not
mean
yielding
and
he
knew
it
no
she
said
with
a
deep
breath
it
is
true
that
i
do
not
know
and
i
am
afraid
a
wan
little
smile
that
was
more
piteous
than
tears
curved
her
lips
for
afraid
seemed
strange
coming
from
her
the
fearless
child
of
the
hills
and
dales
if
if
i
said
ah
but
i
do
not
she
broke
off
as
he
made
to
draw
her
to
him
and
she
shrank
back
i
do
not
i
said
it
would
not
be
true
it
would
not
be
fair
for
i
do
not
know
i
might
be
sorry
after
after
you
had
gone
and
it
would
be
too
late
then
you
right
he
assented
grimly
once
i
got
you
no
power
on
earth
should
make
me
let
you
go
again
her
lips
quivered
and
her
eyes
drooped
before
his
how
strange
a
thing
this
love
was
that
it
should
change
a
man
so
i
do
want
to
force
you
to
answer
he
said
after
a
pause
yes
i
do
i
give
half
the
remainder
of
my
life
to
hear
you
say
the
one
word
but
i
wo
it
too
too
precious
ah
do
you
understand
i
want
your
love
your
love
ida
yes
i
understand
she
murmured
and
and
i
would
say
it
if
if
i
were
sure
but
i
yes
i
am
all
confused
it
is
like
a
dream
i
want
to
think
to
ask
myself
if
if
i
can
do
what
you
want
she
put
up
her
hand
to
her
lips
with
a
slight
gesture
as
if
to
keep
them
from
trembling
i
want
to
be
alone
to
think
of
all
all
you
have
told
me
her
gauntlet
slipped
from
her
hand
and
he
knelt
on
one
knee
and
picked
it
up
and
still
kneeling
took
both
her
hands
in
his
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
remember
that
the
woman
who
hesitates
is
won
something
in
her
girlish
innocence
in
her
exquisitely
sweet
candour
filled
him
with
awe
dearest
he
said
in
so
low
a
voice
that
the
note
of
the
curlew
flying
above
them
sounded
loud
and
shrill
by
contrast
dearest
for
you
are
that
to
me
i
will
not
press
you
i
will
be
content
to
wait
god
knows
you
are
right
to
hesitate
your
love
is
too
great
too
precious
a
thing
to
be
given
to
me
without
thought
i
not
worthy
to
touch
you
but
i
love
you
i
will
wait
you
shall
think
of
all
i
have
said
and
let
your
answer
be
what
it
may
i
wo
complain
but
ida
you
must
forget
that
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
she
looked
down
at
his
handsome
face
the
face
over
which
her
lips
had
hovered
only
a
short
time
since
and
her
lips
moved
you
you
are
good
to
me
she
said
in
a
faintly
troubled
voice
yes
i
know
i
feel
that
perhaps
i
ought
to
say
do
he
said
almost
fiercely
wait
let
me
see
you
again
you
scarcely
know
me
ah
ida
what
can
i
do
how
can
i
win
your
love
she
drew
her
hands
from
his
with
a
deep
breath
i
i
will
go
now
she
said
will
you
let
me
go
alone
he
rose
and
went
towards
the
horses
his
own
raised
its
head
and
seemed
inclined
to
start
but
stood
uncertain
and
eventually
remained
quiet
beside
the
chestnut
stafford
brought
them
to
where
ida
still
stood
her
eyes
downcast
her
face
pale
with
his
own
bridle
over
his
arm
he
put
her
into
the
saddle
resisting
even
in
that
supreme
moment
the
almost
irresistible
desire
to
take
her
in
his
arms
she
murmured
a
thank
you
as
she
slowly
put
on
her
left
gauntlet
he
drew
the
other
from
her
and
as
she
looked
at
him
questioningly
he
put
it
to
his
lips
and
thrust
it
under
his
waistcoat
over
his
heart
the
colour
flooded
her
face
but
the
blush
was
followed
by
the
old
look
of
trouble
and
doubt
she
held
out
her
ungloved
right
hand
and
he
took
it
and
held
it
for
a
moment
then
raised
it
to
his
lips
but
he
did
not
kiss
it
no
he
said
with
stern
repression
i
will
take
nothing
until
you
give
it
me
she
inclined
her
head
the
very
slightest
as
if
she
understood
as
if
she
were
grateful
then
letting
her
eyes
rest
on
his
with
an
inscrutable
look
she
spoke
softly
to
the
horse
and
rode
away
with
donald
and
bess
clamouring
joyously
after
her
as
if
they
had
found
the
proceedings
extremely
trying
stafford
flung
his
arm
across
his
horse
and
leaning
against
it
looked
after
her
his
eyes
fixed
wistfully
on
the
slight
graceful
figure
until
it
was
out
of
sight
then
he
gazed
round
him
as
if
he
were
suddenly
returning
from
a
new
mysterious
region
to
the
old
familiar
world
passion
marvellous
spell
still
held
him
he
was
still
throbbing
with
a
ecstasy
of
her
nearness
of
the
touch
of
her
hand
the
magic
of
her
voice
for
the
first
time
he
was
in
love
in
love
with
the
most
exquisite
the
most
wonderful
of
god
divine
creatures
he
knew
as
he
had
said
that
her
answer
meant
life
or
death
to
him
the
life
of
infinite
nameless
joy
the
death
of
life
in
death
was
he
going
to
lose
her
the
very
question
set
him
trembling
he
held
out
his
quivering
hand
and
looked
at
it
and
set
his
teeth
heaven
and
earth
how
strange
it
was
this
girl
had
taken
possession
of
him
body
and
soul
every
fibre
of
his
being
clamoured
for
her
to
be
near
her
just
to
be
able
to
see
her
hear
her
meant
happiness
to
be
torn
from
her
the
sweat
broke
out
on
his
forehead
and
he
laughed
grimly
and
this
is
love
he
said
between
his
teeth
yes
and
it
the
only
love
of
my
life
god
help
me
if
you
say
dearest
but
you
must
not
you
must
not
chapter
xv
quite
an
hour
after
stafford
had
started
to
meet
ida
miss
falconer
made
her
appearance
coming
slowly
down
the
stairs
in
the
daintiest
of
morning
frocks
with
her
auburn
hair
shining
like
old
gold
in
the
sunlight
and
an
expression
of
languor
in
her
beautiful
face
which
would
have
done
credit
to
a
lily
she
had
slept
the
sleep
of
the
just
the
maid
who
had
gone
to
wake
her
with
her
early
cup
of
tea
had
been
almost
startled
by
the
statuesqueness
of
her
beauty
as
she
lay
with
her
head
pillowed
on
her
arm
and
her
wonderful
hair
streaming
over
the
pillow
had
suffered
herself
to
be
dressed
with
imperial
patience
and
looked
as
howard
who
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
said
to
himself
like
a
queen
of
the
incas
descending
to
her
miss
falconer
he
greeted
her
it
a
lovely
morning
you
find
it
nicely
aired
she
smiled
languidly
that
means
that
i
am
late
she
said
her
eyes
resting
languidly
on
his
cynically
smiling
face
good
heavens
no
he
responded
you
ca
be
late
or
early
in
this
magic
palace
whenever
you
you
will
find
things
in
the
most
comprehensive
sense
ready
for
you
breakfast
at
brae
wood
is
the
most
moveable
of
feasts
i
proved
that
for
i
a
late
bird
myself
and
to
my
joy
i
have
learned
that
this
is
the
only
house
with
which
i
am
acquainted
that
you
can
get
bacon
and
kidneys
at
any
hour
from
eight
to
twelve
that
lunch
runs
plenteously
from
one
to
three
and
that
you
can
get
tea
and
toast
my
great
and
only
weakness
miss
falconer
whenever
you
like
to
ring
for
it
you
will
find
lady
clansford
presiding
at
the
i
believe
she
has
been
sitting
there
amiable
martyr
as
she
is
since
the
early
dawn
she
smiled
at
him
with
languid
approval
as
if
he
were
some
paid
jester
and
went
into
the
there
were
others
there
beside
lady
clansford
most
of
them
the
young
people
it
is
alas
only
the
young
who
can
sleep
through
the
bright
hours
of
a
morn
and
a
discussion
on
the
programme
of
the
day
was
being
carried
on
with
a
babel
of
voices
and
much
laughter
you
shall
decide
for
us
miss
falconer
exclaimed
one
of
the
young
men
whose
only
name
appeared
to
be
bertie
for
he
was
always
addressed
as
and
spoken
of
by
it
it
a
between
a
drive
and
a
turn
on
the
lake
in
the
electric
launch
proposed
a
sail
but
there
seemed
to
be
a
confirmed
and
general
scepticism
as
to
my
yachting
capacities
and
lady
plaistow
says
she
does
want
to
be
drowned
before
the
end
of
the
season
what
would
you
like
to
do
sit
somewhere
in
the
shade
with
a
book
she
replied
promptly
but
slowly
there
was
a
shout
of
laughter
that
is
just
what
howard
replied
said
bertie
complainingly
oh
howard
everyone
knows
that
he
is
the
laziest
man
in
the
whole
world
remarked
lady
clansford
plaintively
what
is
orme
going
to
do
where
is
he
does
anyone
know
there
was
a
general
shaking
of
heads
and
a
chorus
of
noes
i
had
a
swim
with
him
this
morning
but
i
not
seen
him
since
said
bertie
it
no
use
waiting
for
orme
he
might
turn
up
till
miss
falconer
if
i
promise
not
to
drown
you
will
make
one
for
the
yacht
the
man
told
me
it
would
be
all
ready
she
shook
her
head
as
she
helped
herself
to
a
couple
of
strawberries
no
thanks
she
said
with
her
musical
drawl
i
know
what
that
means
you
drift
into
the
middle
of
the
lake
or
the
river
the
wind
drops
and
you
sit
in
a
scorching
sun
and
get
a
headache
please
leave
me
out
i
shall
stick
to
my
original
proposal
perhaps
if
you
drown
anyone
this
time
i
may
venture
with
you
another
day
she
leant
back
and
smiled
at
them
under
her
lids
as
the
discussion
flowed
and
ebbed
round
her
with
an
air
of
placid
contempt
and
wonder
at
their
excitement
and
presently
murmuring
something
to
lady
clansford
who
as
chaperone
and
deputy
hostess
was
trying
to
coax
them
into
some
decision
she
rose
and
went
out
to
the
terrace
there
lying
back
in
a
in
a
corner
screened
from
any
possible
draught
by
the
glass
verandah
was
howard
with
one
of
sir
stephen
priceless
havanas
between
his
lips
a
french
novel
in
his
hand
and
a
morning
paper
across
his
knees
he
rose
as
she
approached
and
checking
a
sigh
of
resignation
offered
her
his
chair
oh
no
she
said
with
a
smile
which
showed
that
she
knew
what
the
effort
of
politeness
cost
him
you
hate
me
if
i
took
your
chair
i
know
and
though
of
course
i
do
in
the
least
care
whether
you
hate
me
or
not
i
should
like
putting
you
to
the
trouble
of
so
exhaustive
an
emotion
howard
smiled
at
her
with
frank
admiration
let
compromise
it
he
said
i
drag
that
chair
up
here
it
out
of
the
sun
you
know
so
and
arrange
these
cushions
so
and
put
up
the
end
for
your
feet
so
and
how
is
that
miss
falconer
thanks
she
murmured
sinking
into
the
soft
nest
he
had
made
do
you
object
to
my
cigar
say
so
if
you
do
and
you
go
off
to
some
other
nook
she
put
in
no
i
like
it
his
eye
shone
with
keen
appreciation
this
girl
was
not
only
a
beauty
which
is
almost
common
nowadays
but
witty
which
is
rare
thanks
would
you
like
the
paper
do
hesitate
if
you
would
i
not
reading
it
i
never
do
i
keep
it
there
so
that
i
can
put
it
over
my
face
if
i
feel
like
sleeping
which
i
generally
do
she
declined
the
paper
with
a
gesture
of
her
white
hand
no
rather
talk
which
means
that
you
are
to
talk
and
i
to
listen
will
it
exhaust
you
too
much
to
tell
me
where
the
rest
of
the
people
are
i
left
a
party
in
the
squabbling
over
the
problem
how
to
kill
time
but
where
are
the
others
my
father
for
instance
he
is
in
the
library
with
baron
wirsch
griffenberg
and
the
other
financiers
they
are
doubtless
engaged
in
some
mystic
rites
connected
with
the
worship
of
the
golden
calf
rites
in
which
the
words
appear
at
frequent
intervals
i
suppose
your
father
having
joined
them
is
a
member
of
the
sect
of
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
suppose
so
and
orme
is
he
one
of
them
she
asked
with
elaborate
indifference
howard
smiled
cynically
stafford
no
all
that
he
knows
about
money
is
the
art
of
spending
it
and
what
he
does
know
about
that
is
worth
knowing
it
slips
through
his
fingers
like
water
through
a
sieve
and
one
of
those
mysteries
which
burden
my
existence
is
how
he
always
manages
to
have
some
for
a
friend
up
a
tree
is
he
so
generous
then
she
asked
with
a
delicate
yawn
behind
her
hand
howard
nodded
and
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
said
musingly
you
got
on
my
favorite
subject
stafford
miss
falconer
and
i
warn
you
that
if
i
go
on
i
shall
bore
you
well
i
can
get
up
and
go
away
she
said
languidly
he
is
a
friend
of
yours
i
suppose
by
the
way
did
you
know
that
he
stopped
those
ridiculous
horses
last
night
and
probably
saved
my
life
for
goodness
sake
do
let
him
hear
you
say
that
or
even
guess
that
you
think
it
he
said
with
an
affectation
of
alarm
stafford
would
be
inexpressibly
annoyed
he
hates
a
fuss
even
more
than
most
englishmen
and
would
take
it
very
unkindly
if
you
did
let
a
little
thing
like
that
pass
unnoticed
oh
yes
i
am
his
greatest
friend
i
do
think
slowly
and
contemplatively
that
there
is
anything
he
would
do
for
me
or
anything
i
would
do
for
him
excepting
get
up
early
go
out
in
the
rain
oh
it
is
true
i
only
bragging
he
broke
off
with
a
groan
i
done
both
and
shall
do
them
whenever
he
wants
me
to
i
a
poor
creature
miss
falconer
a
martyr
on
the
altar
of
friendship
she
said
orme
must
be
very
irresistible
he
is
he
assented
with
an
air
of
profound
melancholy
stafford
has
the
extremely
unpleasant
knack
of
getting
everybody
to
do
what
he
wants
it
very
disgusting
but
it
true
that
is
why
he
is
so
general
a
favourite
why
if
you
walk
into
any
and
asked
who
was
the
most
popular
man
in
london
the
immediate
and
unanimous
reply
would
be
orme
she
settled
the
cushions
a
little
more
comfortably
you
mean
amongst
men
she
said
howard
smiled
and
eyed
her
questioningly
well
i
did
he
replied
drily
she
laughed
a
little
scornfully
oh
i
know
the
sort
of
man
he
is
she
said
i
read
and
heard
about
them
the
sort
of
man
who
falls
in
love
with
every
woman
he
meet
servant
of
dames
howard
leant
back
and
laughed
with
cynical
enjoyment
you
never
were
further
out
he
said
he
flirts
oh
my
aunt
how
he
flirts
but
as
to
falling
in
love
did
you
ever
see
an
iceberg
miss
falconer
she
shook
her
head
well
it
one
of
the
biggest
the
most
beautiful
frauds
in
the
world
when
you
meet
one
sailing
along
in
the
atlantic
you
think
it
one
of
the
nicest
sweetest
things
you
ever
saw
it
so
dazzlingly
bright
with
its
thousand
and
one
colours
glittering
in
the
sunlight
you
quite
fall
in
love
with
it
and
it
looks
so
harmless
so
enticing
that
you
tempted
to
get
quite
close
to
it
which
no
doubt
is
amusing
to
the
iceberg
but
is
slightly
embarrassing
for
you
for
the
iceberg
is
on
you
before
you
know
it
and
and
there
is
enough
left
of
you
for
a
decent
funeral
that
stafford
all
the
way
he
so
pleasant
so
frank
so
lovable
that
you
think
him
quite
harmless
but
while
admiring
his
confounded
ingratiating
ways
while
you
growing
enthusiastic
about
his
engaging
tricks
he
the
best
rider
the
best
dancer
the
best
shot
oh
but
you
must
have
heard
of
him
he
is
bearing
down
upon
you
your
heart
goes
under
and
he
ah
well
he
just
sails
over
you
smiling
quite
unconscious
of
having
brought
you
to
everlasting
smash
you
are
indeed
a
friend
she
said
with
languid
irony
oh
you
think
i
giving
him
away
he
said
my
dear
miss
falconer
everybody
knows
him
every
every
is
strewed
with
his
wrecks
and
all
the
time
he
does
know
it
but
goes
his
way
crowned
with
a
modesty
which
is
the
marvel
and
the
wonder
of
this
most
marvellous
of
ages
it
sounds
like
a
hero
out
of
one
of
novels
she
remarked
as
listlessly
as
before
but
behind
her
lowered
lids
her
eyes
were
shining
with
a
singular
brightness
howard
turned
to
her
delightedly
my
dear
miss
falconer
if
you
were
a
man
i
should
ask
to
shake
hands
with
you
it
so
exactly
describes
him
that
just
what
he
is
as
handsome
as
the
dew
i
beg
your
pardon
as
frank
as
a
boy
as
gentle
as
a
woman
as
staunch
as
a
as
brave
he
would
have
stopped
a
drayman
team
just
as
readily
as
yours
last
night
and
as
invulnerable
as
that
marble
statue
he
pointed
to
a
statue
of
adonis
which
stood
whitely
on
the
edge
of
the
lawn
and
she
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
at
it
dreamily
i
could
break
that
thing
if
i
had
a
big
hammer
she
said
i
daresay
he
said
but
ca
break
stafford
honestly
he
looked
at
her
i
wish
you
could
why
she
asked
turning
her
eyes
on
him
for
the
first
time
howard
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
looked
at
her
with
a
curious
gravity
because
it
would
be
good
for
him
because
i
am
afraid
for
him
afraid
she
echoed
yes
he
said
with
a
nod
some
day
he
will
run
against
something
that
will
bring
him
to
smash
some
woman
but
i
beg
your
pardon
do
you
know
miss
falconer
that
you
have
a
dangerous
way
of
leading
one
to
speak
the
truth
which
one
should
never
or
very
rarely
do
why
on
earth
am
i
telling
you
all
this
about
stafford
orme
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
you
were
saying
woman
she
said
he
gave
a
sigh
of
resignation
you
are
irresistible
some
woman
who
will
be
quite
unworthy
of
him
it
always
the
case
the
block
of
ice
you
can
not
smash
with
your
biggest
hammer
is
broken
into
smithereens
by
a
needle
that
the
peril
before
stafford
but
let
us
hope
he
will
prove
the
exception
to
the
rule
and
escape
he
safe
at
present
at
any
rate
she
thought
of
the
scene
she
had
witnessed
the
girl
sitting
sideways
on
stafford
orme
horse
and
her
face
flushed
for
an
instant
are
you
sure
she
said
quite
he
responded
confidently
i
know
all
stafford
flirtations
great
and
small
if
there
was
anything
serious
he
would
tell
me
and
as
he
has
there
is
she
laughed
the
slow
soft
laugh
which
made
howard
think
suddenly
strangely
of
a
sleepy
tigress
he
had
once
watched
in
a
rajah
zoo
as
she
lay
basking
in
the
sun
a
thing
of
softness
and
beauty
and
death
we
had
a
most
amusing
conversation
howard
she
said
i
know
when
i
been
so
interested
or
so
tempted
tempted
he
looked
at
her
with
a
slow
expectant
smile
oh
yes
she
murmured
turning
her
eyes
upon
him
with
a
light
in
them
you
have
forgotten
that
you
have
been
talking
to
a
woman
i
do
deny
it
he
said
it
the
finest
compliment
i
could
pay
you
but
after
and
that
to
a
woman
your
account
of
your
is
a
challenge
he
nodded
and
paused
with
his
cigar
to
his
lips
i
greatly
tempted
to
accept
it
do
you
know
she
said
he
laughed
do
you
be
vanquished
is
that
too
candid
too
brutal
he
said
so
brutal
that
i
accept
it
she
said
is
that
ring
of
yours
a
favorite
i
had
it
ever
since
i
can
remember
it
was
my
mother
he
said
rather
gravely
she
held
out
her
hand
upon
which
the
costly
gems
glittered
in
the
sunlight
choose
one
to
set
against
it
she
said
quite
quietly
howard
roused
for
once
from
his
sleepy
cynicism
met
her
gaze
with
something
like
astonishment
you
mean
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
mean
that
i
am
going
to
try
to
meet
your
iceberg
you
will
play
fair
howard
you
will
stand
and
look
on
and
be
silent
he
smiled
and
leant
back
as
if
he
had
considered
her
strange
audacious
proposal
and
felt
confident
on
my
honour
he
said
with
a
laugh
you
shall
have
fair
play
she
laughed
softly
you
have
not
chosen
my
stake
she
said
meaningly
ah
no
pardon
let
me
see
he
took
her
hand
and
examined
the
rings
this
i
think
it
the
most
valuable
it
does
not
matter
she
said
you
will
not
win
it
may
i
look
at
yours
he
extended
his
hand
with
an
amused
laugh
but
without
a
smile
she
said
yes
it
is
a
quaint
ring
i
like
quaint
things
i
shall
wear
it
on
my
little
finger
she
dropped
his
hand
quickly
for
at
that
moment
stafford
rode
round
the
bend
of
the
drive
his
face
was
grave
and
almost
stern
in
its
preoccupation
but
he
caught
sight
of
them
and
raised
his
hat
then
turned
his
horse
and
rode
up
to
the
terrace
stafford
exclaimed
howard
where
have
you
been
hallo
anything
happened
you
coated
all
over
with
mud
had
a
fall
he
nodded
carelessly
as
he
turned
to
the
beautiful
girl
lying
back
now
and
looking
up
at
his
handsome
face
with
an
air
of
languid
indifference
what
a
lovely
day
miss
falconer
where
are
all
the
others
are
you
not
going
for
a
drive
on
the
lake
somewhere
i
have
just
been
asking
howard
to
take
me
for
a
row
she
said
but
he
has
refused
stafford
laughed
and
glanced
at
his
watch
i
can
quite
believe
it
he
the
laziest
wretch
in
existence
if
you
transfer
the
offer
to
me
we
go
after
lunch
by
george
there
the
bell
thanks
she
murmured
and
she
rose
with
her
slow
grace
i
better
get
into
an
appropriate
costume
howard
what
will
you
bet
me
that
it
does
not
rain
before
we
start
but
you
never
bet
you
tell
me
not
unless
i
am
sure
of
winning
miss
falconer
he
said
significantly
she
looked
after
stafford
as
he
rode
away
to
the
stable
nor
i
she
retorted
with
a
smile
as
you
will
see
chapter
xvi
when
stafford
and
maude
falconer
went
down
to
the
lake
after
luncheon
they
found
a
party
from
the
villa
just
embarking
on
board
one
of
the
launches
the
air
was
filled
with
laughter
and
chatter
and
the
little
quay
was
bright
with
the
white
flannels
of
the
men
and
the
gay
frocks
of
the
women
the
party
greeted
the
two
with
an
exuberant
welcome
and
bertie
called
out
to
ask
them
if
they
were
coming
on
board
perhaps
you
would
rather
go
on
the
launch
miss
falconer
said
stafford
but
she
shook
her
head
no
thanks
she
said
languidly
i
hate
crowds
of
that
kind
rather
stick
to
our
original
proposition
it
will
bore
me
less
but
perhaps
you
rather
join
them
is
it
likely
said
stafford
with
a
smile
as
he
signed
to
the
man
to
bring
up
a
skiff
now
let
me
make
you
as
comfortable
as
i
can
we
ought
to
have
had
a
gondola
he
added
as
he
handed
her
to
the
seat
in
the
stern
she
leant
back
with
her
sunshade
over
her
shoulder
and
stafford
as
he
slipped
off
his
blazer
and
rowed
out
towards
the
centre
of
the
lake
looked
at
her
with
unconscious
admiration
she
was
simply
perfectly
dressed
in
a
yachting
costume
of
white
and
which
set
off
to
the
fullest
advantage
her
exquisite
complexion
and
her
hair
but
it
was
admiration
of
the
coldest
kind
for
even
at
that
moment
he
was
thinking
of
the
girl
in
the
habit
the
girl
he
loved
with
a
passion
that
made
his
slightest
thought
of
her
a
psalm
of
worship
and
maude
though
she
appeared
half
asleep
like
a
beautiful
wild
animal
basking
in
the
warmth
of
the
sun
glanced
at
him
now
and
again
and
noted
the
strength
and
grace
of
his
figure
the
almost
grecian
contour
of
the
handsome
face
she
had
made
her
wager
with
howard
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
prompted
by
the
vanity
of
a
woman
piqued
by
the
story
of
stafford
indifference
to
her
sex
but
as
she
looked
at
him
she
wondered
how
a
woman
would
feel
if
she
fell
in
love
with
him
but
she
had
no
fears
for
herself
there
was
a
coldness
in
her
nature
which
had
hitherto
guarded
her
from
the
fever
which
men
call
love
and
she
thought
herself
quite
secure
there
would
be
amusement
triumph
in
making
him
love
her
in
winning
her
wager
with
that
cynical
howard
who
boasted
of
his
friend
invulnerability
and
when
she
had
conquered
and
gratified
her
vanity
ah
well
it
would
be
easy
to
step
aside
and
bring
the
curtain
down
upon
her
triumph
and
discomfiture
she
would
wear
that
howard
ring
and
every
time
she
looked
at
it
it
should
remind
her
of
her
conquest
stafford
rowed
on
in
silence
for
some
minutes
his
beautiful
companion
did
not
seem
to
want
him
to
talk
and
certainly
showed
no
desire
to
talk
herself
so
he
gave
himself
up
to
thinking
of
ida
and
wishing
that
it
was
she
who
was
sitting
opposite
him
there
instead
of
this
girl
with
the
face
of
a
grecian
goddess
with
the
lustrous
hair
of
an
houri
at
last
feeling
that
he
ought
to
say
something
he
remarked
as
he
gazed
at
the
marvellous
view
very
beautiful
is
it
she
raised
her
eyes
and
let
them
wander
from
the
glittering
water
to
the
glorious
hills
yes
i
suppose
it
is
i
afraid
i
do
appreciate
scenery
as
much
as
other
people
do
perhaps
it
is
because
one
is
always
expected
to
fall
into
raptures
over
it
does
that
shock
you
i
afraid
i
shock
most
people
the
fact
is
i
have
been
brought
up
in
a
circle
which
has
taught
me
to
loathe
sentiment
they
were
always
gushing
about
their
feelings
but
the
only
thing
they
cared
for
was
money
that
ought
to
have
made
you
loathe
money
said
stafford
with
a
smile
and
a
certain
kind
of
interest
indeed
it
was
difficult
not
to
feel
interested
in
this
beautiful
girl
with
the
face
and
the
form
of
a
goddess
and
apparently
as
small
a
capacity
of
emotion
oh
no
she
said
languidly
on
the
contrary
it
showed
me
the
value
of
money
i
saw
that
if
i
had
not
been
rich
the
daughter
of
a
rich
man
i
should
have
been
of
no
account
in
their
eyes
they
were
always
professing
to
love
me
but
i
was
quite
aware
that
it
was
because
i
was
rich
enough
to
be
able
to
buy
pleasure
for
them
unpleasant
kind
of
people
remarked
stafford
no
just
the
average
she
said
coolly
nearly
all
men
and
women
are
alike
worldly
selfish
look
at
my
father
she
went
on
as
coolly
as
before
he
thinks
of
nothing
but
money
he
has
spent
his
life
fighting
scrambling
struggling
for
it
and
look
at
yours
oh
hold
on
said
stafford
laughing
but
reddening
a
little
very
much
mistaken
if
you
think
my
father
is
that
kind
of
man
she
smiled
why
everybody
has
some
story
of
his
what
shall
i
call
it
acuteness
sharpness
and
of
the
wonderful
way
in
which
he
has
always
got
what
he
wanted
i
do
want
to
be
offensive
orme
but
i
afraid
both
our
fathers
are
in
the
same
category
and
that
both
would
sacrifice
anything
or
anyone
to
gain
their
ends
stafford
laughed
again
you
altogether
wrong
miss
falconer
he
said
i
happen
to
know
that
my
governor
is
one
of
the
most
generous
and
of
men
and
that
whatever
he
has
gained
it
is
by
fair
means
and
by
no
sacrifice
of
others
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
envy
your
faith
in
him
but
then
you
are
a
very
enviable
man
told
as
how
asked
stafford
pretty
here
is
it
here
one
of
those
beastly
steamers
coming
they
spoil
the
lake
but
they
very
convenient
i
suppose
she
glanced
at
the
big
steamer
puffing
towards
them
obtrusively
and
sending
a
trail
of
smoke
across
the
green
and
violet
of
the
hills
oh
i
told
you
are
the
most
popular
man
in
london
that
you
have
the
world
at
your
feet
that
you
are
only
waiting
to
see
which
duchess
you
prefer
to
throw
your
handkerchief
to
stafford
coloured
what
rot
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
falconer
of
course
i
know
you
are
only
chaffing
me
is
it
true
about
the
duchess
i
mean
she
asked
so
coolly
so
indifferently
that
stafford
was
compelled
to
take
her
seriously
nary
a
word
he
said
brightly
then
with
a
sudden
gravity
if
you
happen
to
hear
such
nonsense
again
miss
falconer
you
can
if
you
care
to
contradict
it
flatly
i
am
not
in
the
least
likely
to
marry
a
duchess
indeed
i
would
marry
the
highest
and
greatest
of
them
if
she
have
me
which
is
highly
improbable
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
no
ambition
that
you
would
marry
for
love
she
asked
stafford
stopped
rowing
for
a
moment
and
looked
at
her
grimly
what
on
earth
else
should
i
marry
for
he
asked
would
you
before
she
could
answer
the
steamer
came
abreast
of
them
and
so
close
that
the
swell
from
its
screw
set
the
slight
narrow
skiff
dancing
and
plunging
on
the
waves
maude
uttered
a
faint
cry
and
leant
forward
and
stafford
fearing
she
was
going
to
rise
stretched
out
his
hand
and
touching
her
knee
forced
her
into
her
seat
again
and
kept
her
there
until
the
swell
had
subsided
the
colour
flooded
her
face
at
the
pressure
of
his
strong
hand
which
was
like
a
steel
weight
and
she
caught
her
breath
then
as
he
took
his
hand
away
and
resumed
rowing
he
said
i
beg
your
pardon
i
was
afraid
you
were
going
to
get
up
a
girl
i
once
had
in
a
boat
did
so
and
we
upset
the
boat
is
very
small
she
said
in
a
low
voice
almost
one
of
apology
oh
it
all
right
so
long
as
you
sit
still
and
keep
your
head
he
said
it
could
ride
over
twice
as
big
a
swell
as
this
she
looked
at
him
from
under
her
lowered
lids
with
a
new
expression
in
her
face
a
faint
tremor
on
her
lips
and
as
if
she
could
not
meet
his
eyes
she
glanced
back
with
an
affectation
of
interest
at
the
steamer
as
she
did
so
something
dropped
from
it
into
the
lake
what
was
that
she
said
something
fell
overboard
eh
a
man
do
you
mean
he
asked
stopping
oh
no
something
small
a
parcel
somebody
lunch
perhaps
he
said
and
he
rowed
on
she
leant
back
her
eyes
downcast
she
still
seemed
to
feel
that
strong
irresistible
pressure
of
his
hand
under
which
she
had
been
unable
to
move
there
ought
to
be
an
echo
somewhere
here
he
said
as
they
came
opposite
one
of
the
hills
and
he
gave
the
australian
in
a
clear
ringing
voice
which
the
echo
sent
back
in
a
musical
imitation
how
true
it
was
she
said
and
she
opened
her
lips
and
sang
a
bar
or
two
of
the
elsie
song
stafford
listened
to
the
echo
which
was
almost
as
soft
and
sweet
as
the
girl
notes
what
a
wonderful
voice
you
have
he
said
almost
unconsciously
i
never
heard
a
sweeter
what
was
that
you
sang
that
thing
of
wagner
she
replied
and
quite
naturally
she
began
the
air
and
sang
it
through
stafford
let
the
boat
drift
and
leant
upon
the
oars
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
face
a
rapt
and
very
eloquent
admiration
in
his
own
ah
beautiful
he
said
in
a
low
voice
what
a
delight
it
must
be
to
you
to
be
able
to
sing
like
that
i
can
understand
a
whole
theatre
crying
over
that
song
sung
as
you
sing
it
she
glanced
at
him
with
an
affectation
of
languid
amusement
but
she
was
watching
him
intently
that
not
the
best
in
the
opera
she
said
i
like
this
better
and
she
sang
the
swan
song
sang
it
so
low
that
he
leant
forward
to
catch
the
notes
which
flowed
like
silver
from
her
soft
red
lips
and
when
she
finished
it
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
still
leant
forward
looking
at
her
thank
you
thank
you
he
said
with
so
much
of
admiration
and
gratitude
in
his
voice
that
as
if
to
apologise
for
it
he
said
fond
of
music
but
i
forgetting
your
tea
shall
we
pull
back
to
the
ferry
hotel
and
get
some
i
in
your
hands
she
replied
languidly
he
boat
and
pulled
back
along
the
centre
of
the
lake
in
silence
suddenly
she
bent
forward
there
is
something
in
the
water
she
said
something
alive
it
a
yes
it
a
dog
he
said
that
is
what
you
saw
drop
over
the
steamer
by
george
the
poor
little
chap
looks
in
distress
seems
as
if
he
were
nearly
done
can
you
steer
he
asked
sharply
oh
yes
she
replied
languidly
why
because
i
going
for
him
and
it
will
help
me
if
you
can
steer
straight
for
him
he
looks
nearly
played
out
why
should
you
trouble
it
a
long
way
off
it
will
be
drowned
before
you
can
get
to
it
she
said
i
have
to
go
for
it
anyway
he
said
cheerfully
and
he
began
to
row
hard
distance
is
deceptive
on
a
lake
and
the
dog
was
farther
off
than
they
thought
but
stafford
put
his
back
into
it
as
hard
as
he
had
done
in
his
racing
days
and
maude
falconer
leant
back
and
watched
him
with
interest
and
something
even
stronger
than
interest
in
her
masked
eyes
he
had
turned
up
the
sleeves
of
his
flannel
shirt
and
the
muscles
on
his
arms
were
standing
out
under
the
strain
his
lips
were
set
tightly
and
there
was
the
man
frown
of
determination
on
his
brow
it
has
gone
down
it
no
use
she
said
you
may
as
well
stop
and
rest
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
no
he
has
come
up
again
he
exclaimed
it
was
noticeable
that
he
called
the
dog
he
while
she
spoke
of
it
as
it
we
shall
get
him
in
time
keep
the
boat
straight
the
words
were
uttered
in
a
tone
of
command
and
they
moved
her
as
the
touch
of
his
hand
had
done
and
she
set
her
mind
upon
the
task
as
she
had
never
before
set
it
upon
anything
reaching
well
forward
pulling
with
the
long
steady
stroke
of
the
practised
oarsman
stafford
sent
the
boat
along
like
an
arrow
and
presently
he
drove
it
up
to
the
spot
where
the
dog
strove
in
its
death
straggle
it
was
a
tiny
terrier
and
stafford
as
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
saw
the
great
eyes
turned
to
him
with
a
piteous
entreaty
that
made
his
heart
ache
turn
the
boat
quick
he
cried
and
as
the
skiff
slid
alongside
the
dog
he
swooped
it
up
the
mite
gave
a
little
gasping
cry
like
a
child
and
closing
its
eyes
sank
into
stafford
arms
with
a
shudder
is
it
dead
asked
maude
falconer
looking
not
at
the
dog
but
at
stafford
for
his
face
which
had
been
red
with
exertion
a
moment
ago
had
become
suddenly
pale
i
do
know
no
he
said
absently
all
his
thoughts
centered
on
the
dog
he
wiped
it
as
dry
as
he
could
with
his
blazer
then
turning
aside
he
opened
his
shirt
and
put
the
cold
morsel
in
his
bosom
poor
little
beggar
he
like
ice
he
said
in
a
low
voice
he
would
never
have
got
to
the
shore
he
so
small
if
i
some
brandy
get
some
at
the
ferry
can
you
row
no
she
said
yes
i
mean
i
try
he
held
out
his
hand
mind
how
you
cross
take
off
your
gloves
first
or
you
blister
your
hands
she
obeyed
her
eyes
downcast
they
exchanged
places
and
he
showed
her
how
to
hold
the
sculls
you
do
very
well
you
can
row
as
slowly
as
you
like
he
alive
i
can
feel
him
move
poor
little
chap
sorry
to
trouble
you
miss
falconer
but
the
only
chance
of
saving
him
is
to
keep
him
warm
she
was
silent
far
a
moment
then
she
glanced
at
him
you
fond
of
dogs
why
of
course
he
answered
are
you
but
i
do
think
i
risk
pneumonia
for
one
you
were
feverishly
hot
just
now
and
that
little
beast
must
be
stone
cold
you
get
bronchitis
or
something
mr
orme
not
i
he
laughed
almost
scornfully
he
pulling
round
poor
little
beast
here
we
are
he
reached
for
his
coat
and
wrapped
the
terrier
in
it
and
quite
unconscious
of
the
girl
watchful
eyes
held
the
little
head
to
his
face
for
a
moment
all
right
now
he
murmured
you
had
a
narrow
squeak
for
it
old
chappie
with
the
dog
under
his
arm
he
helped
maude
falconer
ashore
and
led
the
way
to
the
hotel
tea
he
said
to
the
waiter
but
bring
me
some
brandy
and
milk
first
and
look
sharp
maude
sank
on
to
one
of
the
benches
in
the
beautiful
garden
in
the
centre
of
the
lake
and
looked
straight
before
her
and
stafford
cuddled
the
dog
up
to
him
and
looked
impatiently
for
the
waiter
greeting
him
when
he
came
with
what
an
infernal
time
you
been
then
he
poured
a
little
of
the
brandy
down
the
dog
throat
and
bending
over
him
repeated
the
dose
three
or
four
times
and
presently
the
mite
stirred
and
moved
its
head
and
opening
its
eyes
looked
up
into
stafford
and
weakly
putting
out
its
tongue
licked
his
hand
stafford
laughed
for
the
reason
plucky
little
chap
is
he
he
said
with
a
moved
man
affectation
of
levity
he
made
a
splendid
fight
for
it
and
won
through
he
a
pretty
little
morsel
a
wonder
whom
he
belongs
to
to
you
at
least
his
life
does
said
maude
falconer
you
have
fought
harder
for
it
if
it
had
been
a
human
being
oh
a
dog
the
next
thing
you
know
he
said
apologetically
afraid
it
been
an
awful
nuisance
and
trouble
for
you
you
blistered
your
hands
i
hope
let
me
see
she
stretched
out
her
hands
palm
upwards
and
he
took
them
and
examined
them
no
that
all
right
well
that
ends
well
you
want
a
few
lessons
with
the
sculls
miss
falconer
and
you
make
a
splendid
perhaps
you
let
me
give
you
one
or
two
thank
you
yes
she
said
and
to
his
surprise
with
less
of
her
usual
languor
here
the
tea
any
particular
kind
of
cake
you
fancy
she
said
that
the
cakes
would
do
and
poured
out
the
tea
but
he
put
some
milk
into
his
saucer
and
gave
some
to
the
terrier
slowly
methodically
and
with
a
tenderness
and
gentleness
which
was
not
lost
upon
the
girl
who
watched
him
covertly
before
paying
any
attention
to
his
own
tea
i
wonder
whether
you
could
stand
my
little
man
he
said
and
he
put
the
terrier
on
the
ground
it
stood
upright
and
shivering
for
a
moment
then
it
put
its
tiny
paws
on
stafford
knee
and
looked
up
into
his
face
appealingly
not
up
to
your
usual
form
just
yet
eh
said
stafford
and
he
picked
it
up
gently
and
put
it
on
his
knee
maude
falconer
looked
at
him
give
it
to
me
she
said
men
have
no
lap
he
be
more
comfortable
with
me
but
he
wet
still
he
said
he
spoil
that
pretty
dress
of
yours
my
pretty
dress
was
made
to
be
spoiled
she
said
give
it
to
me
please
and
get
your
tea
do
you
mean
it
he
asked
with
a
surprise
which
made
her
flush
with
resentment
and
something
like
shame
for
reply
she
bent
forward
took
the
dog
from
him
and
tried
to
settle
it
on
her
lap
but
the
mite
looked
piteously
at
stafford
and
whined
its
big
eyes
imploring
him
to
let
it
come
back
but
stafford
stroked
it
and
bade
it
sit
still
and
presently
it
curled
itself
up
it
has
gone
to
sleep
said
maude
it
has
soon
forgotten
its
trouble
it
a
way
dogs
have
said
stafford
may
i
smoke
george
what
a
lovely
afternoon
she
glanced
at
him
as
he
leant
back
in
his
chair
his
long
legs
stretched
out
and
crossed
before
him
you
look
happy
she
said
with
a
faint
smile
oh
i
am
he
said
with
a
sudden
flush
and
a
start
for
now
the
dog
was
off
his
mind
it
had
instantly
swung
back
to
ida
it
the
reward
of
a
generous
action
she
said
and
again
the
mocking
note
was
absent
from
her
voice
stafford
laughed
that
putting
it
rather
high
he
said
they
sat
on
in
silence
stafford
thinking
of
ida
maude
looking
down
at
the
sleeping
dog
and
thinking
that
only
a
few
minutes
ago
it
had
been
lying
in
the
bosom
of
the
man
who
sat
beside
her
the
man
whom
she
had
backed
herself
to
fool
but
for
whom
a
strange
sensation
of
admiration
and
was
it
a
subtle
fear
was
stirring
within
her
by
george
we
must
be
going
he
said
suddenly
when
they
got
to
the
boat
he
proposed
to
roll
the
terrier
in
his
coat
but
maude
shook
her
head
i
nurse
it
going
home
she
said
you
will
that
very
good
of
you
he
said
quite
gratefully
he
a
lucky
little
beggar
he
remarked
after
awhile
as
he
looked
at
the
black
little
morsel
curled
up
on
the
pretty
dress
supposing
he
is
claimed
would
you
care
to
have
him
miss
falconer
she
looked
down
at
the
dog
thank
you
she
said
but
what
shall
i
give
you
in
return
unlucky
to
give
an
animal
without
some
consideration
oh
give
me
another
song
he
replied
there
is
nobody
about
she
opened
her
lips
then
checked
herself
no
i
ca
sing
again
she
said
in
a
low
voice
oh
all
right
it
is
good
for
you
to
sing
too
much
in
the
open
air
i
wait
till
this
evening
if
you
be
good
enough
to
sing
for
us
then
they
landed
and
walked
up
to
the
house
as
they
reached
the
bend
leading
to
the
entrance
path
she
stopped
and
held
out
the
dog
which
had
been
staring
at
stafford
and
whining
at
intervals
take
it
please
it
is
fretting
for
you
and
i
rather
not
keep
it
really
he
said
and
she
saw
his
face
brighten
suddenly
all
right
if
you
rather
come
here
little
man
what
your
name
i
wonder
what
shall
we
call
him
while
we
got
him
call
him
he
small
enough
she
said
with
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
tiny
it
is
he
assented
brightly
he
answer
to
it
in
a
day
or
two
you
see
i
hope
you
have
quite
spoilt
your
dress
miss
falconer
and
wo
regret
your
row
she
looked
at
her
dress
but
there
was
a
sudden
significance
in
her
slow
lingering
response
i
do
know
as
she
went
up
the
stairs
she
looked
over
the
rail
and
saw
tall
figure
striding
down
the
hall
he
was
softly
pulling
the
ears
and
talking
to
it
in
the
language
dogs
understand
and
love
and
when
she
sank
into
a
chair
in
her
room
his
face
with
its
manly
tenderness
was
still
before
her
his
deep
musical
voice
with
its
note
of
protection
and
succour
still
rang
in
her
ears
she
sat
quite
motionless
for
a
minute
or
two
then
she
rose
and
went
to
the
glass
and
looked
at
herself
a
long
intent
look
yes
i
am
beautiful
she
murmured
not
with
the
of
vanity
but
with
a
calculating
note
in
her
voice
am
i
am
i
beautiful
enough
then
she
swung
away
from
the
glass
with
the
motion
which
reminded
howard
of
a
tigress
and
setting
her
teeth
hard
laughed
with
but
with
something
also
of
fear
in
the
laugh
i
am
a
fool
she
muttered
it
ca
be
true
so
soon
so
suddenly
oh
i
ca
be
such
a
fool
chapter
xvii
if
everybody
was
not
enjoying
himself
at
the
villa
it
certainly
was
not
the
fault
of
the
host
sir
stephen
orme
howard
as
he
drew
his
chair
up
beside
stafford
when
the
ladies
had
left
the
room
after
dinner
and
the
gentlemen
had
begun
to
glance
longingly
at
the
rare
chateau
claret
and
the
windermere
port
made
a
remark
to
this
effect
upon
my
word
staff
it
is
the
most
brilliant
which
i
have
ever
joined
and
as
to
your
father
in
his
character
of
host
well
words
fail
to
express
my
admiration
stafford
glanced
at
his
father
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
nodded
sir
stephen
had
been
the
life
and
soul
and
spring
of
the
dinner
talking
fashionable
gossip
to
lady
fitzharford
on
one
side
of
him
and
a
giddy
girl
of
twenty
on
the
other
exchanging
badinage
with
bertie
and
telling
deeply
interesting
stories
to
the
men
and
he
was
now
dragging
reluctant
laughter
from
the
grim
baron
wirsch
and
the
almost
grimmer
griffenberg
as
he
saw
with
one
eye
that
the
wine
was
circulating
and
with
the
other
that
no
one
was
being
overlooked
or
allowed
to
drop
into
dullness
a
most
marvellous
man
nearly
all
the
morning
he
was
closeted
with
the
financiers
in
the
afternoon
he
went
for
a
ride
with
lady
clansford
he
was
in
attendance
at
the
solemn
function
of
afternoon
tea
he
played
croquet
and
played
it
well
at
five
at
six
i
saw
him
walking
round
the
grounds
with
the
effords
and
the
fitzharfords
and
now
he
is
laughing
and
talking
with
the
of
a
boy
of
while
the
boy
of
sits
here
as
grave
and
silent
as
if
he
had
been
working
like
a
horse
or
a
sir
stephen
orme
instead
of
fooling
about
the
lake
with
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
party
and
his
friend
has
spent
the
day
in
a
on
the
terrace
retorted
stafford
at
any
rate
i
have
been
out
of
mischief
said
howard
then
he
remembered
his
wager
with
maude
falconer
and
added
rather
remorsefully
at
least
i
hope
so
by
the
way
do
you
echo
my
expression
of
opinion
that
miss
falconer
is
the
most
beautiful
woman
here
or
elsewhere
stafford
woke
from
the
reverie
into
which
he
nearly
always
dropped
when
howard
was
talking
and
nodded
indifferently
oh
yes
she
is
lovely
of
course
how
good
of
you
how
kind
and
gracious
retorted
howard
ironically
so
my
prince
deigns
to
approve
of
her
and
you
also
condescended
to
admit
that
she
is
er
rather
clever
i
daresay
said
stafford
i
seen
so
little
of
her
she
seems
to
me
rather
and
cold
howard
nodded
yes
but
the
worst
of
it
is
you
ca
count
upon
that
kind
of
girl
they
are
apt
to
warm
up
sometimes
and
quite
unexpectedly
and
when
they
do
they
well
they
boil
like
a
geyser
or
a
volcano
and
then
well
then
it
is
wise
to
get
out
of
reach
i
once
knew
a
woman
who
was
considered
to
be
as
cold
as
charity
or
a
rich
relation
but
who
caught
fire
one
day
and
burnt
up
the
man
who
ignited
her
of
course
this
is
my
delicate
way
of
saying
oh
my
prince
stafford
smiled
miss
falconer
nature
was
a
matter
of
profound
indifference
to
him
there
was
only
one
woman
on
whom
he
could
bestow
a
thought
and
he
was
thinking
of
her
now
wondering
when
he
should
see
her
whether
he
might
dare
to
tell
her
of
his
love
again
to
ask
her
for
her
answer
once
or
twice
his
father
looked
across
at
him
and
nodded
and
smiled
as
if
he
loved
to
see
him
and
wanted
to
speak
to
him
and
stafford
smiled
and
nodded
back
as
if
he
understood
when
the
men
rose
to
go
to
the
sir
stephen
caught
him
up
at
the
door
and
laid
a
hand
upon
his
arm
happy
dear
boy
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
full
of
affection
seen
scarcely
anything
of
you
no
no
i
not
complaining
it
was
understood
that
you
were
to
have
a
free
hand
but
but
i
missed
you
never
mind
this
crowd
will
have
gone
presently
and
then
ah
then
we
have
a
jolly
time
to
ourselves
things
are
going
well
he
added
with
a
significant
smile
as
he
glanced
at
wirsch
and
griffenberg
who
and
comfortable
were
in
front
of
them
i
glad
sir
said
stafford
sir
stephen
smiled
but
checked
a
sigh
and
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
yes
my
little
schemes
are
flourishing
but
he
looked
at
the
financiers
again
they
are
rather
a
hard
team
to
drive
as
stafford
entered
the
he
heard
lady
clansford
enquiring
for
miss
falconer
we
want
her
to
sing
orme
and
i
can
not
find
her
i
think
she
is
on
the
terrace
said
bertie
who
always
seemed
to
know
where
everybody
was
stafford
went
out
by
one
of
the
windows
and
saw
maude
falconer
pacing
up
and
down
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
she
was
superbly
dressed
and
as
he
looked
at
her
he
involuntarily
admired
the
grace
of
her
movements
falconer
was
walking
with
bent
head
and
hands
behind
his
back
but
now
and
again
he
looked
at
her
sideways
with
his
sharp
eyes
stafford
did
not
like
to
interrupt
them
and
withdrew
to
the
other
end
of
the
terrace
with
a
cigarette
to
wait
till
they
joined
him
young
orme
has
come
out
to
look
for
you
said
falconer
without
turning
his
head
i
know
she
said
though
she
also
had
not
turned
they
want
me
to
sing
i
will
go
in
directly
you
have
not
answered
my
question
father
is
sir
stephen
very
rich
or
is
all
this
only
sham
i
have
heard
you
say
so
often
that
display
very
often
only
covers
poverty
falconer
eyed
her
curiously
why
do
you
want
to
know
what
does
it
matter
to
you
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
impatiently
resentfully
and
he
went
on
yes
he
rich
confoundedly
so
but
he
is
playing
a
big
game
in
which
he
is
running
some
risks
and
he
want
all
his
money
to
help
him
win
it
and
are
you
joining
him
in
the
game
she
asked
he
looked
at
her
with
surprise
there
was
a
note
in
her
voice
which
he
had
never
heard
before
a
note
which
conveyed
to
him
the
fact
that
she
was
no
longer
a
girl
but
a
woman
upon
my
soul
i
do
know
why
you
ask
well
well
she
had
repeated
the
impatient
gesture
i
have
made
up
my
mind
yet
he
wants
me
to
join
him
i
could
be
of
service
to
him
on
the
other
hand
i
could
yes
get
in
his
way
for
i
know
some
of
the
points
of
the
game
he
is
playing
yes
i
could
help
him
or
spoil
him
and
which
are
you
going
to
do
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
her
eyes
veiled
her
lips
drawn
straight
falconer
laughed
grimly
i
do
know
it
all
depends
which
would
you
do
he
asked
half
sarcastically
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
she
said
you
knew
sir
stephen
some
time
ago
years
ago
father
falconer
nodded
i
did
he
said
shortly
and
you
were
friends
and
you
quarrelled
he
looked
at
her
with
an
air
of
surprise
i
saw
you
both
when
you
stood
opposite
each
other
after
the
carriage
accident
she
said
coolly
i
am
not
blind
and
i
am
not
particularly
stupid
it
did
strike
me
at
the
time
that
there
had
been
anything
wrong
between
you
but
i
have
since
seen
you
look
at
sir
stephen
and
you
have
an
expressive
face
sometimes
oh
my
father
he
grinned
grimly
you
appear
to
keep
your
eyes
open
maude
yes
there
was
a
row
between
us
and
there
was
a
grudge
which
you
mean
to
pay
off
she
said
as
impassively
as
if
they
were
speaking
of
the
merest
trivialities
which
i
could
pay
off
gratify
if
i
liked
he
admitted
how
she
asked
he
did
not
reply
but
glanced
at
her
sideways
and
bit
at
the
cigar
which
he
had
stopped
to
light
shall
i
tell
you
if
i
were
a
man
and
i
wanted
revenge
upon
such
a
man
as
sir
stephen
orme
what
i
should
do
father
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
and
looking
straight
before
her
as
if
she
were
meditating
you
can
if
you
like
what
would
you
do
he
replied
with
a
touch
of
sarcastic
amusement
she
looked
round
her
and
over
her
shoulder
the
windows
near
them
were
closed
stafford
with
his
cigarette
was
too
far
off
to
overhear
them
if
i
were
a
man
rich
and
powerful
as
you
are
and
i
owed
another
a
grudge
i
would
not
rest
night
or
day
until
i
had
got
him
into
my
power
whether
i
meant
to
exact
my
revenge
or
not
i
would
wait
and
work
and
scheme
and
plot
until
i
had
him
at
my
mercy
so
that
i
could
say
now
you
got
the
better
of
me
once
you
played
me
false
once
but
it
is
my
turn
now
he
should
sue
for
mercy
and
i
would
grant
it
or
refuse
it
as
it
pleased
me
but
he
should
feel
that
he
was
in
my
power
that
my
hand
was
finer
than
his
my
strength
greater
he
shot
a
glance
at
her
and
his
great
rugged
face
grew
lined
and
stern
where
did
you
get
those
ideas
why
do
you
talk
to
me
like
this
he
muttered
with
surprise
and
some
suspicion
i
am
not
a
child
she
said
languidly
and
i
have
been
living
with
you
for
some
time
now
sir
stephen
orme
is
a
great
man
is
surrounded
by
great
and
famous
people
while
you
with
all
your
money
are
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
well
just
nobody
his
face
grew
dark
she
was
playing
on
him
as
a
musician
plays
on
an
instrument
with
which
he
is
completely
familiar
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
he
muttered
if
i
were
a
man
in
your
place
i
would
have
the
great
sir
stephen
at
my
feet
to
make
or
to
break
as
i
pleased
i
would
never
rest
until
i
could
be
able
to
say
a
great
man
in
the
world
eyes
but
i
am
your
master
you
are
my
puppet
and
you
have
to
dance
to
my
music
whether
the
tune
be
a
dead
march
or
a
jig
that
is
what
i
should
do
if
i
were
a
man
but
i
am
only
a
girl
and
it
seems
to
me
nowadays
that
men
have
more
of
the
woman
in
them
than
we
have
he
stopped
and
stared
at
her
in
the
moonlight
a
dark
frown
on
his
face
his
eyes
heavy
with
doubt
and
suspicion
look
here
my
girl
he
said
you
are
showing
up
in
a
new
light
you
are
talking
as
your
mother
used
to
talk
and
you
doing
it
without
a
purpose
what
is
it
what
grudge
can
you
a
mere
girl
who
has
only
known
him
for
a
couple
of
days
have
against
sir
stephen
she
smiled
let
us
say
that
i
am
only
concerned
for
my
father
wounded
pride
and
honour
she
said
or
let
us
say
that
i
a
game
of
my
own
to
play
and
that
i
am
asking
you
to
help
me
while
you
gratify
your
own
desire
for
revenge
will
you
help
me
tell
me
tell
me
what
your
game
is
good
lord
with
a
scowl
fancy
you
having
a
game
it
it
ridiculous
almost
as
ridiculous
as
calling
me
a
girl
and
expecting
to
see
me
playing
with
a
doll
or
a
hoop
she
returned
calmly
but
you
reply
i
can
see
you
mean
to
do
it
like
a
good
and
indulgent
father
and
some
day
perhaps
soon
i
will
like
a
good
and
dutiful
daughter
tell
you
why
i
wanted
you
to
do
it
is
that
you
orme
will
i
come
and
sing
oh
yes
if
you
wish
it
where
is
the
little
dog
she
asked
looking
up
at
him
with
a
new
expression
in
her
languorous
eyes
as
she
glided
beside
him
asleep
on
my
bed
replied
stafford
with
a
laugh
my
man
has
turned
him
off
and
made
him
a
luxurious
couch
with
cushions
three
or
four
times
but
he
would
persist
on
getting
on
again
so
he
have
to
stay
i
suppose
are
you
always
so
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
or
do
you
reserve
all
your
tenderness
of
heart
for
dogs
and
horses
as
howard
declares
howard
is
too
often
an
ass
remarked
stafford
with
a
smile
you
shall
choose
your
song
as
a
reward
for
your
exertions
this
afternoon
she
said
as
he
led
her
to
the
piano
most
of
the
men
in
the
crowd
waiting
eagerly
for
the
exquisite
voice
would
have
been
moved
to
the
heart
core
by
her
tone
and
the
expression
in
her
usually
cold
eyes
but
stafford
was
clothed
in
the
armour
of
his
great
love
and
only
inclined
his
head
thanks
anything
you
like
he
said
with
the
proper
amount
of
gratitude
she
shot
a
glance
at
him
and
sank
into
the
languidly
but
a
moment
afterwards
as
if
she
could
not
help
herself
she
was
singing
a
tuscan
with
a
subdued
passion
which
thrilled
even
the
audience
clustered
round
her
it
thrilled
stafford
but
only
with
the
desire
to
be
near
ida
a
desire
that
became
irresistible
and
when
she
had
finished
he
left
the
room
caught
up
his
hat
and
overcoat
and
went
out
of
the
house
as
he
did
so
falconer
walked
past
him
into
the
griffenberg
was
alone
there
seated
in
a
big
with
a
cigar
as
black
as
a
hat
and
as
long
as
a
penholder
falconer
wheeled
a
chair
up
to
him
and
in
his
blunt
fashion
said
you
are
in
this
railway
scheme
of
orme
griffenberg
griffenberg
nodded
and
you
yes
said
falconer
succinctly
i
am
joining
i
suppose
it
all
right
orme
will
be
able
to
carry
it
through
griffenberg
emitted
a
thick
cloud
of
smoke
it
will
try
him
a
bit
it
a
question
of
capital
ready
capital
helping
him
got
his
oriental
shares
as
cover
a
bit
awkward
for
me
for
i
rather
pushed
just
now
that
estate
loan
you
know
falconer
nodded
i
know
see
here
i
take
those
shares
from
you
if
you
like
and
if
you
say
nothing
about
it
griffenberg
eyed
his
companion
rugged
face
keenly
what
for
he
asked
falconer
smiled
that
my
business
he
said
the
only
thing
that
matters
to
you
is
that
by
taking
the
shares
off
your
hands
i
shall
be
doing
you
a
service
that
true
you
shall
have
said
griffenberg
but
i
warn
you
it
a
heavy
lot
you
shall
have
a
cheque
said
falconer
where
did
you
get
that
cigar
it
takes
my
fancy
griffenberg
produced
his
cigar
case
with
alacrity
he
liked
falconer
way
of
doing
business
at
the
moment
stafford
left
the
villa
ida
was
standing
by
the
window
in
the
of
heron
hall
on
the
table
beside
her
lay
a
book
which
she
had
thrown
down
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
she
was
too
restless
to
read
or
to
work
and
the
intense
quietude
of
the
great
house
weighed
upon
her
with
the
weight
of
a
tomb
all
day
since
she
had
left
stafford
his
words
of
passionate
love
had
haunted
her
they
sang
in
her
ears
even
as
she
spoke
to
her
father
or
jessie
or
the
dogs
who
followed
her
about
with
wistful
eyes
as
if
they
were
asking
her
what
ailed
her
and
as
if
they
would
help
her
he
loved
her
she
had
said
it
to
herself
a
thousand
times
all
through
the
long
afternoon
the
dragging
evening
he
loved
her
it
was
so
strange
so
incredible
they
had
only
met
three
or
four
times
they
had
said
so
little
to
each
other
why
she
could
remember
almost
every
word
he
loved
her
had
knelt
to
her
he
had
told
her
so
in
passionate
words
with
looks
which
made
her
heart
tremble
her
breath
come
fast
as
she
recalled
them
that
is
he
wanted
her
to
be
his
wife
to
to
him
to
be
with
him
always
never
to
leave
him
the
strangeness
the
suddenness
of
the
thing
overwhelmed
her
so
that
she
could
not
think
of
it
calmly
he
had
asked
her
to
think
of
it
to
decide
to
give
him
an
answer
why
could
she
not
she
had
always
hitherto
known
her
own
mind
if
anyone
had
asked
her
a
question
about
the
estate
about
the
farm
she
had
known
what
to
answer
important
as
the
question
might
have
been
but
now
she
seemed
as
if
her
mind
were
paralyzed
as
if
she
could
not
decide
was
it
because
she
had
never
thought
of
love
because
she
had
never
dreamt
that
anyone
would
love
her
so
much
as
to
want
to
have
her
by
his
side
for
all
his
life
as
she
looked
through
the
window
at
the
moonlight
on
the
lawn
she
thought
of
him
called
up
the
vision
of
his
tall
graceful
figure
and
handsome
face
yes
he
was
handsome
she
knew
but
she
had
scarcely
given
a
thought
to
his
face
and
only
felt
that
it
was
good
to
have
him
near
her
to
hear
him
talk
in
his
deep
voice
broken
sometimes
by
the
short
laugh
which
sounded
almost
boyish
it
had
been
good
to
have
him
near
her
but
then
she
had
been
so
lonely
had
seen
so
few
men
scarcely
any
at
all
suppose
when
she
met
him
next
she
said
no
told
him
that
she
could
not
love
him
and
he
went
away
leaving
her
forever
would
she
be
sorry
she
turned
away
from
the
window
suddenly
nearly
stumbling
over
donald
who
was
lying
at
her
feet
his
nose
on
his
paws
his
great
eyes
fixed
sadly
and
speculatively
on
her
face
and
caught
up
the
book
but
face
came
between
her
and
the
page
and
she
put
the
book
down
and
went
into
the
hall
her
father
was
in
the
library
there
was
no
sound
in
the
house
to
drown
the
voice
the
passionately
pleading
voice
which
rang
in
her
ears
i
must
go
out
she
said
i
shall
be
able
to
think
in
the
air
shall
be
able
to
decide
she
caught
up
a
shawl
and
flung
it
carelessly
over
her
head
quite
unconscious
that
the
fleecy
wool
made
an
exquisite
frame
for
the
girlish
loveliness
of
her
face
and
opening
the
door
went
slowly
down
the
broken
steps
the
two
dogs
following
at
her
heels
she
drew
in
the
keen
but
balmy
air
with
a
long
breath
and
looked
up
at
the
moon
now
a
yellow
crescent
in
the
starry
sky
and
something
in
the
beauty
of
the
night
something
subtly
novel
thrilled
her
with
a
strange
sense
of
throbbing
pulsing
joy
and
happiness
underneath
which
lurked
as
subtle
a
fear
and
dread
the
fear
and
dread
of
those
who
stand
upon
the
threshold
of
the
unknown
who
in
passing
that
threshold
enter
a
world
of
strange
things
which
they
never
more
may
leave
love
what
was
it
did
she
feel
it
oh
if
she
could
only
tell
what
should
she
say
to
him
when
she
met
him
and
when
should
she
meet
him
perhaps
he
had
come
to
regret
his
avowal
to
her
had
been
wearied
and
disappointed
by
her
coldness
and
would
not
come
again
at
the
thought
her
heart
contracted
as
if
at
the
touch
of
an
icy
hand
but
the
next
moment
it
leapt
with
a
suffocating
sense
of
mystery
of
joy
for
she
saw
him
coming
across
the
lawn
to
her
and
heard
her
name
spoken
as
it
had
never
yet
been
spoken
excepting
by
him
and
she
stood
still
as
a
statue
as
he
held
out
his
hand
and
looking
into
her
eyes
murmured
her
name
again
ida
chapter
xviii
ida
it
was
the
lover
cry
of
appeal
the
prayer
for
love
uttered
by
the
heart
that
loves
and
it
went
straight
to
her
own
heart
she
put
out
her
hand
and
he
took
it
and
held
it
in
both
his
i
have
come
for
your
answer
he
said
in
the
low
voice
that
thrills
the
voice
which
says
so
much
more
than
the
mere
words
i
could
not
wait
i
tried
to
keep
away
from
you
until
but
it
was
of
no
use
i
am
here
you
see
and
i
want
your
answer
do
tell
me
it
is
trust
me
ida
trust
to
my
love
for
you
i
will
devote
my
life
to
trying
to
make
you
happy
ah
but
you
know
what
is
your
answer
have
you
thought
you
promised
me
you
would
think
i
have
thought
she
said
at
last
i
have
thought
of
nothing
else
i
wanted
to
tell
you
the
truth
to
tell
you
truly
as
i
would
to
myself
but
it
is
so
hard
to
know
sometimes
when
i
think
that
you
may
go
away
and
that
i
may
not
see
you
again
my
heart
sinks
and
i
feel
oh
so
wretched
he
waited
for
no
more
but
caught
her
to
him
and
as
she
lay
in
his
arms
only
slightly
struggling
her
face
upturned
he
bent
his
own
almost
white
with
passion
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
and
not
once
only
the
blood
rushed
to
her
face
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
and
her
face
grown
pale
again
her
eyes
gazed
up
into
his
half
fiercely
half
appealingly
then
suddenly
they
grew
moist
as
if
with
tears
her
lips
quivered
and
from
them
came
as
if
involuntarily
the
words
of
surrender
the
maiden
confession
i
love
you
he
uttered
a
low
sharp
cry
the
expression
of
his
heart
delight
his
soul
triumph
you
love
me
ida
how
how
do
you
know
when
she
shook
her
head
and
sighed
as
she
pressed
her
cheek
against
his
breast
i
do
know
it
was
just
now
the
moment
when
you
kissed
me
then
it
came
to
me
suddenly
the
knowledge
the
truth
it
was
as
if
a
flash
of
light
had
revealed
it
to
me
oh
yes
i
love
you
i
wish
almost
i
wish
that
i
did
not
for
it
hurts
me
she
pressed
her
hand
to
her
heart
and
gazed
up
at
him
with
the
wonder
of
a
child
who
is
meeting
its
first
experience
of
the
strange
commingling
of
pain
and
joy
he
raised
her
in
his
arms
until
her
face
was
against
his
i
know
dearest
he
said
almost
in
a
whisper
it
is
love
it
is
always
so
i
think
my
heart
is
aching
with
longing
for
you
and
yet
i
am
happy
my
god
how
happy
and
you
tell
me
ida
yes
i
am
happy
she
breathed
with
a
deep
sigh
as
she
nestled
still
closer
to
him
it
is
all
so
strange
so
unreal
not
unreal
dearest
he
said
as
they
walked
under
the
trees
her
head
against
his
shoulder
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
supporting
her
it
is
real
enough
this
love
of
mine
which
will
last
me
till
my
death
i
know
and
yours
she
gazed
straight
before
her
dreamily
there
can
be
no
heaven
without
you
without
your
love
she
answered
with
a
solemn
note
in
her
sweet
voice
he
pressed
her
to
him
and
you
have
thought
it
all
out
you
have
realised
that
you
will
be
my
wife
my
very
own
yes
she
said
i
know
now
i
know
that
i
am
giving
you
myself
that
i
am
placing
all
my
life
in
your
hands
god
help
me
to
guard
it
and
make
it
happy
he
said
then
he
laughed
i
have
no
fear
i
will
make
you
happy
ida
i
i
feel
that
i
shall
do
you
understand
what
i
mean
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
set
apart
chosen
from
all
the
millions
of
men
to
love
you
and
cherish
you
and
make
you
happy
and
you
ida
she
looked
up
at
him
with
the
same
dreamy
expression
in
her
wonderful
eyes
now
at
this
moment
i
felt
that
i
too
have
been
set
apart
for
you
is
it
because
you
have
just
said
the
same
no
because
i
felt
it
when
you
kissed
me
just
now
ah
i
am
glad
you
did
it
if
you
had
not
i
might
not
have
known
that
i
loved
you
i
might
have
let
you
go
forever
thinking
that
i
did
not
care
it
was
your
kiss
that
opened
my
heart
to
me
and
showed
me
he
bent
over
her
until
his
lips
nearly
touched
hers
kiss
me
in
return
of
your
own
accord
ida
but
once
if
you
will
but
kiss
me
without
a
blush
solemnly
as
if
it
were
a
sacrament
she
raised
her
head
and
kissed
him
on
the
lips
there
fell
a
silence
the
world
around
them
in
the
soft
shimmer
of
the
crescent
moon
became
an
enchanted
region
the
land
that
never
was
on
earth
or
sea
the
land
of
love
in
which
all
that
dwell
therein
move
in
the
glamour
of
the
sacred
fire
of
love
stafford
broke
it
at
last
it
is
the
man
who
can
not
be
contented
with
silence
he
thirsts
for
his
mistress
voice
dearest
what
shall
i
do
you
must
tell
me
he
said
as
if
he
had
been
thinking
i
will
do
whatever
you
wish
whatever
you
think
best
i
a
strong
suspicion
that
you
the
cleverest
of
us
that
got
more
brains
in
this
sweet
little
finger
of
yours
than
i
got
in
my
clumsy
head
she
laughed
softly
and
looked
at
the
head
which
he
had
libelled
the
shapely
head
with
its
hair
which
sliding
her
hand
up
she
touched
caressingly
shall
i
come
to
your
father
ida
i
will
ride
over
after
breakfast
before
if
you
like
if
i
had
my
way
i
patrol
up
and
down
here
all
night
until
it
was
a
decent
time
to
call
upon
him
she
nestled
a
little
closer
to
him
and
her
brows
came
level
with
sudden
gravity
and
doubt
my
father
i
had
not
thought
of
him
of
what
he
would
say
do
but
i
know
he
he
will
be
very
angry
she
said
in
a
low
voice
will
he
why
stafford
asked
of
course
i
know
i
not
worthy
of
you
ida
no
living
man
is
not
worthy
she
smiled
at
him
with
the
woman
worship
already
dawning
in
her
deep
grey
eyes
it
is
i
who
am
not
worthy
why
think
i
am
only
an
inexperienced
girl
living
the
life
of
a
farmer
daughter
we
are
very
poor
oh
you
do
not
know
how
poor
we
are
almost
as
poor
as
the
smallest
tenant
though
we
live
in
this
big
house
and
are
still
regarded
as
great
people
the
herons
of
herondale
that
one
of
the
things
i
have
been
thinking
of
said
stafford
what
lovely
hair
you
have
ida
it
is
not
often
that
dark
hair
is
so
soft
is
it
he
bent
down
and
drew
a
look
which
his
caresses
had
released
across
her
lips
and
kissed
her
through
it
you
are
lords
of
the
soil
people
of
importance
and
rank
here
while
we
are
well
just
ordinary
folk
i
can
quite
understand
your
father
objecting
dearest
you
are
worthy
of
a
duke
a
prince
she
put
her
hand
up
to
his
lips
to
silence
the
lover
extravagant
flattery
it
is
not
that
the
difference
which
is
all
to
your
advantage
she
said
my
father
may
think
of
it
she
went
on
with
innocent
candour
but
it
would
be
the
same
if
you
were
of
the
highest
rank
he
does
not
want
me
to
leave
him
and
if
he
were
less
anxious
to
keep
you
he
would
not
give
you
to
me
who
am
in
his
opinion
and
rightly
so
much
your
inferior
said
stafford
but
i
ought
to
go
to
him
dearest
i
ought
to
go
she
trembled
a
little
as
she
nestled
against
him
and
and
your
father
sir
stephen
orme
she
said
what
will
he
say
stafford
laughed
slowly
and
confidently
oh
my
father
he
will
be
delighted
he
the
best
of
fathers
a
perfect
model
for
parents
ever
since
i
can
remember
he
has
been
good
to
me
a
precious
sight
better
more
liberal
and
generous
than
i
deserved
but
lately
since
i
known
him
ah
well
i
can
only
say
dearest
that
he
will
be
delighted
to
hear
that
i
have
chosen
a
wife
and
when
he
sees
you
he
stopped
and
held
her
at
arm
length
for
a
moment
and
looked
down
into
the
lovely
face
upturned
to
his
with
its
sweet
girlish
gravity
why
he
will
fall
in
love
with
you
right
out
of
hand
i
think
you
will
like
my
father
ida
he
well
he
a
taking
sort
of
fellow
everybody
likes
him
who
knows
him
really
knows
him
and
speaks
well
of
him
yes
i
proud
of
him
and
i
feel
as
safe
as
if
he
were
here
to
say
in
his
hearty
earnest
way
wish
you
good
luck
stafford
and
may
god
bless
you
my
dear
he
flushed
and
laughed
as
if
a
little
ashamed
of
his
emotional
way
of
putting
it
he
full
of
of
the
milk
of
human
kindness
is
my
father
he
said
with
a
touch
of
simplicity
which
was
one
of
the
thousand
and
fifteen
reasons
why
ida
loved
him
she
gazed
up
at
him
thoughtfully
and
sighed
i
hope
he
will
like
me
she
said
all
the
pride
which
usually
characterized
her
melted
by
her
love
i
am
sure
that
i
shall
like
him
for
loving
you
you
will
see
said
stafford
confidently
he
will
be
as
proud
as
a
duke
about
you
you
wo
mind
if
he
shows
it
a
little
plainly
and
makes
a
little
fuss
ida
he
well
he
used
to
making
the
most
of
a
good
thing
when
he
has
it
it
the
life
he
has
led
which
has
rather
got
him
into
the
way
of
blowing
a
trumpet
you
know
and
he
want
a
whole
orchestra
to
announce
you
but
about
your
father
dearest
shall
i
come
and
ask
for
his
consent
she
looked
up
at
him
with
doubt
and
a
faint
trouble
in
her
beautiful
eyes
and
he
heard
her
sigh
regretfully
i
am
afraid
she
said
in
a
low
voice
afraid
he
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
of
surprise
if
anyone
were
to
tell
me
that
it
was
possible
for
you
to
be
afraid
i
should
believe
them
he
said
fear
and
you
have
made
acquaintance
yet
ida
she
shook
her
head
i
am
so
happy
so
intensely
happy
that
i
am
afraid
lest
the
gods
should
be
jealous
and
snatch
my
happiness
from
me
i
am
afraid
that
if
you
come
my
father
will
say
will
will
have
me
shown
out
said
stafford
gravely
i
see
i
be
surprised
and
and
then
i
should
not
be
able
to
see
you
again
he
laughed
at
the
idea
my
dearest
if
all
the
fathers
in
the
world
said
it
make
any
difference
to
me
he
said
with
that
air
of
masterfulness
that
flash
of
the
eye
which
a
woman
loves
in
a
man
do
you
think
i
should
give
you
up
that
i
should
be
content
to
say
very
sorry
sir
and
go
off
leave
you
keep
away
from
you
he
laughed
again
and
she
nestled
a
little
closer
and
her
small
hand
closed
a
little
more
tightly
on
his
arm
and
you
would
give
me
up
refuse
to
see
me
even
if
your
father
withheld
his
consent
would
you
ida
he
asked
she
looked
straight
before
her
dreamily
then
raised
her
eyes
to
his
gravely
no
i
could
not
it
is
just
that
i
could
not
somehow
i
feel
as
if
i
had
given
you
the
right
to
myself
and
that
nothing
could
alter
it
nothing
could
take
me
away
from
you
how
was
it
possible
for
him
to
refrain
from
lifting
her
in
his
arms
and
kissing
the
sweet
soft
lips
which
made
such
a
confession
they
walked
on
for
a
minute
or
two
in
silence
when
she
went
on
as
if
she
had
been
still
considering
the
matter
no
you
must
not
come
stafford
my
father
is
not
strong
and
and
ah
well
you
know
you
saw
him
that
other
night
the
first
night
we
met
do
you
remember
and
he
was
walking
in
his
sleep
again
the
other
evening
if
you
were
to
come
if
i
were
to
tell
him
that
that
you
had
asked
me
to
be
your
wife
he
might
fly
into
a
passion
it
might
do
him
harm
some
time
ago
when
he
was
ill
the
doctor
told
me
that
he
must
be
kept
quite
quiet
and
that
nothing
must
be
allowed
to
excite
or
irritate
him
he
is
very
old
and
leads
so
secluded
a
life
he
sees
no
one
now
but
myself
oh
how
i
would
like
you
to
come
how
good
it
would
be
if
if
he
would
give
me
to
you
as
other
fathers
give
their
daughters
but
i
dare
not
risk
it
i
can
not
stafford
she
put
her
hands
on
his
breast
and
looked
up
at
him
am
i
wrong
to
tell
you
all
this
to
let
you
see
how
much
i
love
you
is
it
unmaidenly
of
me
tell
me
if
it
is
and
i
will
not
do
so
for
the
future
i
will
hide
my
heart
a
little
better
than
i
am
doing
at
present
ah
see
it
is
on
my
sleeve
he
took
her
arm
and
kissed
the
sleeve
where
her
heart
was
supposed
to
be
i
read
that
men
only
love
while
they
are
not
sure
of
a
love
that
with
every
two
persons
it
is
one
who
loves
and
the
other
who
permits
himself
or
herself
to
be
loved
is
that
true
stafford
if
so
then
it
is
i
who
love
alas
poor
me
he
drew
her
to
him
and
looked
into
her
eyes
with
a
passionate
intensity
it
not
true
he
said
almost
fiercely
for
god
sake
do
say
such
things
they
they
hurt
and
hurt
badly
they
leave
a
bitter
taste
in
the
mouth
a
nasty
pang
behind
and
if
it
were
true
but
it
is
ida
it
is
i
who
love
good
lord
do
you
know
how
beautiful
you
are
have
you
a
in
your
room
do
you
know
that
no
girl
that
ever
was
born
had
such
wonderful
eyes
such
beautiful
hair
oh
my
heart
love
do
you
know
how
perfect
you
are
they
had
stopped
under
some
trees
near
the
ruined
chapel
and
she
leant
against
one
of
them
and
looked
up
at
him
with
a
strange
dreamy
look
in
her
eyes
which
were
dark
as
the
purple
amethyst
i
never
thought
about
it
am
i
do
you
think
i
am
pretty
i
am
glad
yes
i
am
glad
pretty
he
laughed
dearest
when
i
take
you
away
from
here
into
the
world
as
my
wife
my
wife
the
thought
sends
my
blood
coursing
through
my
veins
you
will
create
so
great
a
sensation
that
i
shall
be
half
wild
with
pride
i
shall
want
to
go
about
calling
aloud
is
my
wife
my
very
own
you
may
admire
worship
her
but
she
is
mine
belongs
to
me
to
unworthy
stafford
orme
yes
she
murmured
her
voice
thrilling
you
will
be
proud
of
me
of
me
the
poor
little
country
girl
who
rode
about
the
dales
in
a
shabby
habit
and
an
old
hat
stafford
jessie
was
telling
me
that
there
is
a
very
beautiful
girl
staying
at
the
villa
at
brae
wood
one
of
the
visitors
jessie
said
she
was
lovely
and
that
all
the
and
the
maids
too
were
talking
about
her
she
must
be
more
beautiful
than
i
am
which
of
the
women
do
you
mean
he
said
indifferently
with
the
supreme
indifference
which
the
man
who
is
madly
in
love
feels
for
every
other
woman
than
the
one
of
his
heart
she
is
a
fair
girl
with
blue
eyes
and
the
most
wonderful
hair
with
gold
in
it
as
jessie
described
it
to
me
and
she
says
that
this
girl
wears
the
most
beautiful
diamonds
i
am
still
quoting
jessie
and
other
precious
stones
and
that
she
is
very
and
mighty
and
more
haughty
than
any
of
the
other
ladies
who
is
it
i
think
she
must
mean
miss
falconer
miss
maude
falconer
said
stafford
as
indifferently
as
before
as
he
smoothed
one
of
the
silken
tresses
on
her
brow
and
kissed
it
as
it
lay
on
his
finger
it
is
just
the
way
a
slave
would
describe
her
and
is
she
very
beautiful
asked
ida
yes
i
suppose
she
is
he
said
you
suppose
she
echoed
arching
her
brows
but
with
a
frank
smile
about
her
lips
the
smile
of
contentment
at
his
indifference
you
know
well
yes
she
is
he
admitted
i
scarcely
noticed
her
oh
but
yes
she
is
and
she
sings
very
well
yes
i
can
understand
her
making
a
sensation
in
the
servants
hall
she
makes
one
in
the
but
she
not
my
style
of
beauty
see
here
dearest
it
does
sound
nice
but
though
i
spent
some
hours
with
miss
falconer
and
listened
to
her
singing
i
have
only
just
noticed
that
she
is
and
that
she
has
a
wonderful
voice
they
say
up
at
the
villa
that
nothing
like
it
on
the
stage
excepting
patti
and
melba
but
all
the
time
she
has
been
there
i
have
had
another
face
another
voice
in
my
mind
ever
since
i
saw
you
down
there
by
the
river
i
have
had
no
eyes
for
any
other
woman
face
however
beautiful
no
ears
for
any
other
woman
voice
however
sweet
she
was
silent
a
moment
as
she
clasped
her
hands
and
laid
them
against
his
cheek
how
strange
it
sounds
but
if
you
had
chanced
to
see
her
first
perhaps
you
would
not
have
fallen
in
love
with
me
how
could
you
have
done
so
she
is
so
very
lovely
i
can
see
she
is
by
description
he
laughed
even
if
i
had
not
seen
you
there
was
no
chance
of
my
falling
in
love
with
miss
falconer
dearest
he
said
smiling
at
her
gravity
and
earnestness
she
is
very
beautiful
lovely
in
her
way
if
you
like
but
it
is
not
my
way
she
is
like
a
statue
at
most
times
at
others
just
now
and
again
like
a
well
a
sleek
tigress
in
her
movements
and
the
way
she
turns
her
head
oh
there
was
the
least
danger
of
my
falling
in
love
with
her
even
if
i
had
seen
the
sweetest
and
loveliest
girl
in
all
the
wide
world
and
you
will
feel
like
that
feel
so
sure
so
certain
that
you
love
me
even
though
you
have
seen
and
will
see
so
many
women
who
are
far
more
beautiful
than
i
am
she
said
dreamily
sure
and
certain
he
responded
with
a
long
sigh
if
i
were
as
sure
of
your
love
as
i
am
of
mine
for
you
forgive
me
dearest
for
she
had
raised
her
eyes
to
his
with
an
earnestness
that
was
almost
solemn
you
may
be
sure
she
said
slowly
i
shall
love
you
as
long
as
i
live
i
know
it
i
do
not
know
why
i
only
feel
it
perhaps
we
may
be
parted
he
laughed
but
his
hand
closed
on
hers
and
gripped
them
tightly
but
i
shall
always
love
you
something
has
gone
out
of
me
is
it
my
heart
and
i
can
never
take
it
back
from
you
perhaps
you
may
grow
tired
of
me
it
may
be
i
have
read
and
heard
of
such
things
happening
to
women
you
may
see
someone
more
beautiful
than
miss
falconer
someone
who
will
lead
you
to
forget
the
little
girl
who
rode
through
the
rain
in
herondale
if
so
there
will
be
no
need
to
tell
me
no
need
to
make
excuses
or
ask
for
forgiveness
there
would
be
no
need
to
tell
me
for
something
here
she
drew
her
hand
from
his
and
touched
her
bosom
would
tell
me
you
would
only
have
to
keep
away
from
me
that
is
all
and
i
ah
well
i
should
be
silent
quite
silent
dearest
he
murmured
reproachfully
and
with
something
like
awe
for
her
brows
were
knit
her
face
was
pale
as
ivory
and
her
eyes
glowed
why
do
you
say
this
now
just
as
as
we
have
confessed
our
love
for
each
other
do
you
think
i
shall
be
faithless
i
could
almost
laugh
as
if
any
man
you
deigned
to
love
could
ever
forget
you
ever
care
a
straw
for
any
other
woman
she
turned
to
him
with
a
shudder
a
little
cry
that
was
tragic
in
its
intensity
turned
to
him
and
clenched
her
small
hands
on
his
breast
swear
to
me
she
panted
then
as
if
ashamed
of
the
passion
that
racked
her
her
eyes
dropped
and
the
swift
red
flooded
her
face
no
you
shall
not
swear
to
me
stafford
i
i
will
believe
you
love
me
as
i
shall
love
you
forever
and
forever
but
if
if
the
time
should
come
when
some
other
girl
shall
win
you
from
me
promise
me
that
you
will
not
tell
me
that
you
will
just
keep
away
from
me
i
could
bear
it
if
if
i
did
not
see
you
but
if
i
saw
you
oh
something
like
a
moan
escaped
her
quivering
lips
and
she
flung
herself
upon
his
breast
with
the
the
of
a
child
stafford
was
moved
to
his
inmost
heart
and
for
a
moment
as
he
held
her
within
the
embrace
of
his
strong
arms
he
could
not
command
his
voice
sufficiently
for
speech
at
last
he
murmured
his
lips
seeking
hers
ida
i
swear
that
i
will
love
you
forever
and
forever
but
but
if
you
break
your
vow
you
promise
that
you
will
not
come
to
me
tell
me
i
shall
know
promise
ah
promise
will
nothing
less
content
you
must
i
he
said
almost
desperate
at
her
persistence
then
i
promise
ida
chapter
xix
there
is
something
solemn
and
in
perfect
happiness
how
many
times
in
the
day
did
ida
pull
up
rupert
and
gaze
into
the
distance
with
vacant
unseeing
eyes
pause
in
the
middle
of
some
common
task
look
up
from
the
book
she
was
trying
to
read
to
ask
herself
whether
she
was
indeed
the
same
girl
who
had
lived
her
lonely
life
at
herondale
or
whether
she
had
changed
places
with
some
other
personality
with
some
girl
singularly
blessed
amongst
women
jessie
and
jason
even
the
bovine
william
who
was
reputed
the
stupidest
man
in
the
dale
noticed
the
change
in
her
noticed
the
touch
of
colour
that
was
so
quick
to
mount
to
the
ivory
cheek
the
novel
brightness
and
tenderness
in
the
deep
grey
eyes
the
new
note
the
low
sweet
tone
of
happiness
in
the
clear
voice
her
father
only
remained
unobservant
of
the
subtle
change
but
he
was
like
a
mole
burrowing
amongst
his
book
and
gloating
secretly
over
the
box
which
he
concealed
at
the
approach
of
footsteps
the
opening
of
a
door
and
the
sound
of
a
voice
in
a
distant
part
of
the
house
but
though
the
servants
remarked
the
change
in
their
beloved
mistress
they
did
not
guess
at
its
cause
for
by
chance
rather
than
design
none
of
them
had
seen
ida
and
stafford
together
and
yet
they
met
daily
sometimes
stafford
would
ride
over
from
brae
wood
and
meet
her
by
the
river
there
was
a
hollow
there
so
deep
that
it
hid
not
only
themselves
but
the
horses
and
here
they
would
sit
hand
in
hand
or
more
often
with
his
arm
round
her
and
her
small
shapely
head
with
its
soft
but
roughened
hair
upon
his
breast
sometimes
he
would
row
across
the
lake
and
they
would
walk
side
by
side
along
the
bank
and
screened
by
the
trees
in
which
the
linnet
and
the
thrush
sang
the
songs
which
make
a
lover
litany
at
others
and
these
were
the
sweetest
meeting
of
all
for
they
came
in
the
soft
and
stilly
night
when
all
nature
was
hushed
as
if
under
the
spell
of
the
one
great
passion
he
would
ride
or
walk
over
after
dinner
and
they
would
sit
in
the
ruined
archway
of
the
old
chapel
and
talk
of
their
blank
past
the
magic
present
and
the
future
which
was
to
hold
nothing
but
happiness
love
grows
fast
under
such
conditions
and
the
love
of
these
two
mortals
grew
to
gigantic
proportions
absorbing
the
lives
of
both
of
them
to
stafford
all
the
hours
that
were
not
spent
with
this
girl
of
his
heart
were
so
much
dreary
waste
to
ida
ah
well
who
shall
measure
the
intensity
of
a
girl
first
passion
she
only
lived
in
the
expectation
of
seeing
him
in
his
presence
and
the
whispered
words
and
caresses
of
his
love
and
in
his
absence
in
the
memory
of
them
for
her
life
meant
just
this
man
who
had
come
and
taken
the
heart
from
her
bosom
and
enthroned
his
own
in
its
place
they
told
each
other
everything
stafford
knew
the
whole
of
her
life
before
they
met
all
the
little
details
of
the
daily
routine
of
the
hall
and
her
management
of
the
farm
and
she
learnt
from
him
all
that
was
going
on
at
the
great
splendid
palace
which
in
his
modesty
sir
stephen
orme
had
called
the
villa
she
liked
to
nestle
against
him
and
hear
the
small
details
of
his
life
as
he
liked
to
hear
hers
and
she
seemed
to
know
all
the
visitors
at
the
villa
and
their
peculiarities
as
well
as
if
she
were
personally
acquainted
with
them
you
ought
not
to
leave
them
so
much
stafford
she
said
with
mock
reproof
as
they
sat
one
afternoon
in
the
ballow
by
the
river
you
think
they
notice
your
absence
and
wonder
where
you
are
should
think
so
he
replied
besides
i
do
care
if
they
do
all
my
worry
is
that
i
ca
come
to
you
oftener
every
time
i
leave
you
i
count
up
the
hours
that
must
pass
before
i
see
you
again
but
i
expect
most
if
not
all
of
the
visitors
will
be
off
presently
most
of
have
been
there
the
regulation
fortnight
a
good
many
come
backwards
and
forwards
they
the
city
men
the
money
men
my
father
is
closeted
with
them
for
hours
every
day
that
big
scheme
of
his
seems
to
be
coming
off
satisfactorily
it
a
railway
to
some
place
in
africa
and
all
these
fellows
the
griffenbergs
and
beltons
that
fat
german
baron
wirsch
and
the
rest
of
them
are
in
it
heaven
knows
why
my
father
wants
to
worry
about
it
for
i
heard
one
of
them
say
that
he
calculated
to
make
a
million
and
a
half
out
of
it
as
if
he
rich
enough
a
million
and
a
half
she
said
what
a
large
sum
it
seems
what
one
could
do
with
a
half
a
quarter
a
tenth
of
it
what
would
you
do
dearest
he
asked
she
laughed
softly
i
think
that
i
would
first
buy
you
a
present
and
then
i
have
the
hall
repainted
no
i
get
the
terrace
rails
and
the
portico
mended
and
yet
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
have
the
inside
of
the
house
painted
and
papered
you
see
there
are
so
many
things
i
could
do
with
it
that
it
difficult
to
choose
you
shall
do
all
he
said
putting
his
arm
round
her
see
here
ida
i
been
thinking
about
ourselves
do
you
ever
think
of
anything
else
i
do
she
said
half
unconsciously
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
is
that
meant
for
my
father
or
yours
both
he
replied
we
been
so
happy
this
last
fortnight
is
it
a
fortnight
ago
since
i
got
you
to
tell
me
that
you
cared
for
me
lord
it
seems
a
year
sometimes
and
at
others
it
only
seems
a
minute
that
we
have
cared
to
think
of
how
we
stand
but
it
ca
like
this
forever
ida
you
see
i
want
you
i
want
you
all
to
myself
for
every
hour
of
the
day
and
night
instead
of
for
just
the
few
minutes
i
the
good
luck
to
snatch
directly
this
affair
of
my
governor
is
finished
i
shall
go
to
him
and
tell
him
i
the
happiest
the
luckiest
man
in
the
world
i
shall
tell
him
everything
exactly
how
we
stand
and
ask
him
to
help
us
with
your
father
ida
sighed
and
looked
grave
i
know
dearest
he
said
answering
the
look
but
your
father
has
to
be
faced
some
time
and
i
ida
i
am
impatient
i
want
you
now
as
i
daresay
you
have
discovered
i
am
rather
an
idiot
than
otherwise
and
the
worst
man
in
the
world
to
carry
out
anything
diplomatically
but
my
father
he
laughed
rather
ruefully
well
they
say
he
can
coax
a
concession
out
of
even
the
sultan
of
turkey
that
there
is
no
one
who
can
resist
him
and
i
know
i
shall
be
doing
the
right
thing
by
telling
him
how
we
stand
she
leant
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
her
chin
in
the
palms
of
her
hands
it
shall
be
as
you
say
my
lord
and
master
she
said
and
when
you
tell
him
that
you
have
been
so
foolish
as
to
fall
in
love
with
a
little
miss
nobody
who
lives
in
a
ruined
house
and
is
as
poor
and
friendless
as
a
church
mouse
do
you
think
he
will
be
delighted
that
the
great
and
sir
stephen
orme
will
throw
up
his
hat
for
joy
and
consider
that
you
have
been
very
wise
i
think
when
he
sees
you
what
is
that
he
broke
off
that
was
a
lady
riding
across
the
moor
behind
them
she
was
mounted
on
one
of
the
orme
horses
was
habited
by
redfern
who
had
done
justice
to
her
superb
and
supple
figure
and
the
sunlight
which
poured
from
between
the
clouds
fully
revealed
the
statuesque
beauty
of
her
face
i
know
said
ida
quietly
as
she
looked
at
the
graceful
horsewoman
at
the
lithe
full
figure
the
cold
perfection
of
the
grecian
face
that
is
miss
falconer
it
is
is
it
not
he
nodded
indifferently
and
she
has
seen
us
said
ida
it
does
matter
in
the
least
said
stafford
why
should
she
but
i
do
think
she
has
she
did
not
turn
her
head
as
she
rode
by
that
is
why
said
ida
with
her
woman
acuteness
she
saw
us
from
the
top
of
the
hill
see
the
groom
is
just
riding
down
she
was
silent
a
moment
or
two
watching
maude
falconer
as
she
cantered
away
then
she
shivered
as
if
with
cold
what
is
the
matter
dearest
he
asked
drawing
her
to
him
why
did
you
shudder
she
tried
to
laugh
but
her
eyes
were
grave
and
almost
solemn
i
know
it
was
as
if
someone
had
walked
over
my
grave
as
if
i
felt
the
presentiment
of
some
coming
evil
i
never
felt
like
it
before
yes
she
is
very
beautiful
stafford
she
is
like
a
picture
a
statue
no
that
is
not
fair
for
no
picture
had
ever
such
magnificent
hair
no
statue
was
ever
so
full
of
life
and
oh
i
want
a
word
power
yes
she
is
like
a
tigress
a
tigress
asleep
and
in
a
good
temper
just
for
the
present
but
stafford
laughed
the
strong
and
healthy
man
laugh
of
tolerance
for
the
fancies
of
the
woman
he
loves
my
dear
ida
i
assure
you
miss
falconer
is
quite
an
ordinary
young
woman
with
nothing
mysterious
or
uncanny
about
her
and
if
she
has
seen
us
i
am
rather
glad
i
well
i
want
to
take
you
by
the
hand
and
exclaim
aloud
to
the
whole
world
the
treasure
i
have
found
look
upon
her
but
shade
your
eyes
lest
her
beauty
dazzle
you
and
worship
at
her
feet
only
a
day
or
two
more
and
i
tell
my
father
and
have
him
on
our
side
she
made
a
gesture
of
consent
it
shall
be
as
you
will
she
murmured
again
but
go
now
dearest
i
shall
have
to
ride
fast
to
reach
home
in
time
to
give
my
father
his
tea
maude
falconer
cantered
easily
until
she
had
turned
the
corner
of
the
hill
and
was
out
of
sight
of
stafford
and
ida
then
she
pulled
up
the
horse
who
fretted
under
her
hands
and
tossed
the
foam
from
his
champing
lips
pulled
up
and
looked
straight
before
her
while
the
colour
came
and
went
on
her
smooth
cheek
a
sombre
fire
gleamed
in
the
usually
coldly
calm
eyes
and
her
bosom
heaved
under
the
perfect
moulding
of
the
she
sat
and
looked
before
her
for
a
moment
or
two
as
if
she
were
battling
with
an
emotion
which
threatened
to
master
her
and
to
find
expression
in
some
violent
outburst
but
she
conquered
and
presently
rode
on
to
the
villa
and
half
an
hour
later
stafford
coming
up
the
steps
found
her
lying
back
in
her
favourite
chair
with
a
cup
of
tea
in
her
hand
you
are
just
in
time
she
said
looking
up
at
him
and
he
looked
back
at
her
rather
vacantly
for
ida
had
been
in
his
arms
too
recently
for
his
mind
his
whole
being
to
be
sufficiently
clear
of
her
to
permit
him
to
take
any
interest
in
anything
else
for
tea
she
said
here
it
comes
shall
i
pour
it
out
for
you
have
you
been
riding
far
not
very
far
he
said
you
have
been
riding
too
is
it
a
wonder
we
did
not
meet
yes
she
assented
languidly
i
met
no
one
saw
no
one
while
i
was
out
here
comes
your
shadow
she
added
as
tiny
having
heard
his
beloved
master
voice
came
head
over
heels
and
leapt
on
stafford
lap
how
fond
he
is
of
you
stafford
nodded
yes
i
jolly
glad
no
one
answered
the
advertisement
for
its
owner
she
bent
over
and
stroked
the
terrier
who
always
seemed
uneasy
under
her
caress
and
her
hand
touched
stafford
she
glanced
at
him
as
it
did
so
but
the
white
hand
so
soft
and
warm
might
have
been
a
piece
of
senseless
wood
for
all
its
effect
upon
him
whose
soul
was
still
thrilling
with
ida
heron
touch
and
with
a
tightening
of
the
lips
she
took
her
hand
away
and
leant
back
but
her
eyes
still
clung
to
him
as
all
unconscious
he
bent
over
the
dog
at
that
moment
a
carriage
drove
up
and
falconer
alighted
he
came
up
the
steps
his
heavy
face
grave
and
yet
alert
and
his
keen
eyes
glanced
at
the
pair
as
they
sat
side
by
side
stafford
looked
up
and
nodded
glad
to
see
you
back
falconer
he
said
pleasantly
stands
london
where
it
did
pretty
much
so
yes
responded
falconer
grimly
yes
plenty
of
other
thing
change
have
their
day
and
cease
to
be
but
the
little
village
keeps
its
end
up
and
sees
things
and
men
come
and
go
flare
up
flicker
and
fizzle
out
no
thanks
i
have
some
tea
in
my
room
and
like
a
dutiful
daughter
i
will
go
and
pour
it
out
for
him
said
maude
she
rose
tiny
rose
also
and
barked
at
her
followed
her
father
to
his
room
and
stood
watching
him
as
he
took
off
his
he
had
no
valet
and
slowly
put
on
a
loose
jacket
well
she
said
at
last
he
sank
into
a
chair
and
looked
up
at
her
with
a
sardonic
smile
on
his
face
yes
i
back
he
said
i
hurried
back
because
sir
stephen
is
going
to
sign
the
articles
going
to
bring
the
thing
to
a
conclusion
she
nodded
her
eyes
fixed
on
his
ones
with
a
calm
but
keen
watchfulness
and
you
have
you
he
leant
forward
and
held
out
one
hand
open
yes
i
got
him
fast
and
tight
his
hand
closed
and
his
eyes
shot
a
swift
lurid
gleam
from
under
their
lids
i
got
him
as
in
a
vice
i
only
to
turn
the
screw
and
i
squeeze
him
as
flat
and
dry
as
a
lemon
she
drew
a
long
breath
of
satisfaction
of
relief
you
are
clever
she
said
and
in
one
fortnight
he
smiled
grimly
yes
it
is
sharp
work
and
it
has
taken
some
doing
and
some
money
but
i
worked
it
black
steve
i
mean
sir
stephen
orme
the
great
sir
stephen
is
under
my
thumb
the
night
of
his
triumph
i
am
going
to
crack
him
like
an
egg
you
will
ruin
him
she
said
that
is
it
he
said
with
a
nod
i
shall
ruin
him
is
there
no
escape
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
none
he
replied
grimly
i
tell
you
that
nothing
can
save
him
excepting
one
thing
she
said
in
so
low
a
voice
that
it
sounded
as
if
she
were
speaking
to
herself
eh
he
said
as
if
he
had
not
caught
the
words
what
is
it
you
mean
what
can
save
him
what
is
this
one
thing
his
heavy
brows
came
done
and
he
frowned
at
her
she
raised
her
eyes
cold
and
glittering
like
steel
and
met
his
frown
unflinchingly
the
marriage
of
his
son
stafford
with
your
daughter
she
said
slowly
calmly
chapter
xx
falconer
started
and
stared
at
her
his
heavy
face
growing
a
his
eyes
distended
with
amazement
and
anger
are
you
out
of
your
mind
he
said
at
last
and
frowning
at
her
in
a
kind
of
perplexity
my
soul
maude
i
never
quite
certain
whether
you
are
in
jest
or
earnest
if
this
is
intended
for
a
joke
permit
me
to
tell
you
i
consider
it
in
vilely
bad
taste
i
am
not
jesting
she
said
very
quietly
her
chin
in
her
hand
her
blue
eyes
fixed
on
his
unblushingly
i
am
in
the
most
sober
the
most
serious
earnest
i
assure
you
he
rose
then
sank
into
the
chair
again
and
sighed
impatiently
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
that
he
confound
it
if
ever
there
was
a
man
to
be
pitied
it
is
the
one
who
has
the
honour
to
be
your
father
maude
why
she
asked
calmly
have
i
not
been
a
dutiful
daughter
have
i
ever
given
you
any
trouble
deceived
you
am
i
not
perfectly
frank
with
you
at
this
moment
he
rose
and
paced
to
the
and
leaning
against
it
looked
down
upon
her
the
frown
still
on
his
heavy
face
his
hands
thrust
deeply
in
his
pockets
you
always
been
a
puzzle
to
me
he
said
more
to
himself
than
to
her
ever
since
you
were
born
i
felt
uncertain
about
you
like
your
mother
but
never
mind
that
what
game
is
this
carrying
on
one
in
which
i
mean
to
win
she
replied
slowly
meditatively
have
you
not
seen
how
slow
to
perceive
even
you
a
reputedly
clever
man
can
be
i
do
suppose
there
is
a
woman
in
the
house
who
has
not
detected
the
fact
that
i
am
in
love
with
stafford
orme
though
i
have
tried
to
hide
it
from
them
and
you
will
admit
that
i
am
not
a
bad
actress
in
love
with
stafford
orme
his
face
darkened
no
i
did
not
know
it
why
the
devil
does
he
mean
by
not
coming
to
me
he
broke
out
angrily
harshly
she
smiled
he
has
come
to
ask
you
for
me
because
well
he
does
want
me
she
said
in
a
low
voice
what
he
exclaimed
below
his
breath
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
that
why
you
ca
have
the
shamelessness
to
care
for
the
man
without
until
she
broke
in
upon
his
burst
of
indignation
with
a
low
clear
laugh
and
there
was
no
shame
in
her
voice
or
eyes
as
she
said
would
it
be
so
shameful
if
i
have
my
dear
father
you
and
i
should
differ
on
that
point
we
are
told
that
we
are
made
for
love
and
to
be
loved
that
it
is
our
proper
and
natural
destiny
why
then
should
we
be
ashamed
of
it
none
of
us
are
in
reality
we
only
pretend
to
be
it
is
part
of
the
world
system
of
hypocrisy
to
assume
an
incapacity
for
loving
a
man
until
he
has
asked
you
to
pretend
an
utter
indifference
until
he
has
said
the
magic
words
love
you
as
if
love
could
wait
ever
did
wait
ever
will
anyway
mine
did
not
and
i
am
no
different
to
other
women
only
more
candid
by
heaven
you
make
me
feel
mad
he
said
with
suppressed
anger
you
tell
me
unblushingly
to
my
face
that
you
have
fallen
in
love
with
the
son
of
my
old
enemy
that
you
want
to
marry
him
you
ask
me
to
help
you
to
to
forego
my
just
revenge
to
use
my
hold
over
him
as
a
lever
to
induce
him
force
him
good
god
have
you
no
sense
of
right
or
wrong
are
you
utterly
devoid
of
of
modesty
of
womanly
pride
he
glowered
down
upon
her
with
flushed
face
and
angry
eyes
but
she
was
quite
unmoved
by
his
outburst
and
still
met
his
gaze
steadily
almost
reflectingly
a
fortnight
ago
i
should
have
asked
myself
that
question
and
as
angrily
as
you
but
i
ca
now
it
has
gone
too
far
gone
too
far
you
mean
that
i
have
grown
to
love
him
so
much
so
dearly
that
life
without
him
by
god
you
will
have
to
live
without
him
for
i
not
help
you
to
get
him
he
said
fiercely
stafford
orme
stephen
orme
boy
no
put
the
thing
out
of
your
mind
maude
see
here
i
do
want
to
be
angry
i
take
back
all
i
said
you
well
you
surprised
me
and
shocked
me
too
i
admit
you
a
strange
girl
and
say
things
that
you
do
mean
and
in
a
way
that
gives
me
fits
say
no
more
about
it
put
the
idea
out
of
your
head
she
laughed
and
rose
and
gliding
to
him
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
my
dear
father
she
said
in
a
low
voice
but
with
a
strange
and
subtle
vibration
in
it
as
if
the
passion
with
which
she
was
struggling
threatened
to
burst
forth
you
do
know
what
you
ask
you
do
know
what
love
is
and
you
do
know
what
i
am
i
did
know
myself
until
the
last
few
days
until
a
gradual
light
shone
on
the
truth
and
showed
me
my
heart
the
heart
i
once
thought
would
never
grow
warm
with
love
oh
i
was
a
fool
i
played
with
fire
and
i
have
been
burned
i
am
burning
still
she
pressed
her
hand
against
her
bosom
and
for
an
instant
the
passion
within
her
darted
from
her
eyes
and
twisted
the
red
perfectly
formed
lips
her
hand
tightened
on
his
arm
her
breath
came
pantingly
now
quickly
now
slowly
father
i
have
come
to
you
most
girls
go
to
their
mother
i
have
none
i
come
to
you
because
i
must
you
ask
me
to
put
the
the
idea
out
of
my
head
she
laughed
a
low
laugh
of
and
bitterness
do
you
think
i
have
not
tried
to
steel
to
harden
my
heart
against
this
feeling
which
has
been
creeping
insidiously
over
me
creeping
stealing
gliding
like
a
cloud
until
it
has
enveloped
me
i
have
fought
against
it
as
never
woman
fought
against
the
approach
of
love
the
first
day
it
was
the
day
he
took
me
on
the
lake
ah
you
do
remember
but
i
shall
i
ever
forget
it
the
first
day
my
heart
went
out
to
him
i
tried
to
call
it
back
to
laugh
at
my
weakness
to
call
myself
a
fool
and
i
thought
i
had
succeeded
in
driving
the
insidious
feeling
away
but
i
was
wrong
it
was
there
in
my
heart
already
and
day
by
day
as
i
saw
him
as
i
heard
him
speak
the
thing
grew
until
i
could
not
see
him
cross
the
lawn
hear
him
speak
to
the
dog
without
thrilling
without
shivering
shuddering
father
have
pity
on
me
no
i
wo
ask
for
pity
i
have
it
but
i
ask
i
demand
sympathy
your
help
father
she
drew
nearer
to
him
and
looked
into
his
eyes
with
an
awful
look
of
desperation
of
broken
pride
of
the
aching
craving
of
love
you
must
help
me
i
love
him
i
must
be
his
wife
i
can
not
live
without
him
i
will
not
he
paled
and
gnawed
at
his
thick
lip
you
talk
like
a
madwoman
he
said
hoarsely
she
nodded
yes
i
am
mad
i
know
it
i
know
it
but
i
shall
never
be
sane
again
all
my
days
and
all
my
nights
are
consumed
in
this
madness
i
think
of
him
i
call
up
his
face
ah
she
flung
her
hands
before
her
face
and
swayed
to
and
fro
as
if
she
were
half
dazed
half
giddy
with
passion
and
all
day
i
have
to
fight
against
the
risk
the
peril
of
discovery
to
feel
the
women
eyes
on
me
when
he
comes
near
to
feel
that
their
ears
are
strained
to
catch
the
note
in
my
voice
which
will
give
me
away
place
me
under
their
scorn
and
to
know
that
try
as
i
will
my
voice
my
eyes
will
grow
tender
as
they
rest
on
him
as
i
speak
to
him
to
have
to
hide
to
conceal
to
crush
down
my
heart
while
it
is
aching
throbbing
with
the
torture
of
my
love
for
him
he
strode
from
her
then
came
back
the
sight
of
the
storm
within
her
had
moved
him
for
after
all
this
strange
girl
was
his
daughter
flesh
of
his
flesh
bone
of
his
bone
he
swore
under
his
breath
and
struggled
for
speech
and
and
the
man
stafford
he
said
he
he
has
not
said
d
n
it
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
he
is
absolutely
indifferent
that
he
he
does
care
i
tell
you
the
truth
she
said
i
swore
to
myself
that
i
would
there
is
too
much
at
stake
for
me
to
conceal
anything
he
does
not
care
for
me
ralph
falconer
uttered
a
sharp
snarl
of
shame
and
resentment
he
does
and
yet
you
you
want
to
marry
him
she
made
a
gesture
with
her
hands
which
was
more
eloquent
than
words
perhaps
perhaps
there
is
someone
else
someone
of
the
other
women
here
he
suggested
moodily
yes
there
is
someone
else
she
said
with
the
same
calm
decision
no
it
is
not
one
of
the
women
here
it
is
a
girl
in
the
place
a
farmer
daughter
i
think
it
is
only
a
a
vulgar
intrigue
he
uttered
an
exclamation
and
yet
does
cure
you
she
shook
her
head
and
smiled
no
my
case
is
incurable
father
if
he
were
engaged
to
anyone
of
the
women
here
to
someone
his
equal
i
should
still
love
him
and
want
him
yes
and
move
heaven
and
earth
to
get
him
but
this
is
only
a
flirtation
with
some
country
girl
she
meets
him
on
the
by
the
river
anywhere
i
have
seen
them
at
a
distance
once
or
twice
she
is
of
no
importance
she
has
caught
his
fancy
and
will
soon
fail
to
hold
it
she
waved
her
hand
as
if
she
were
moving
the
obstacle
aside
her
father
stared
at
her
in
a
kind
of
stupefaction
my
girl
do
you
know
what
you
are
asking
for
a
life
of
wretchedness
and
misery
the
hell
of
being
married
to
a
man
who
love
you
she
laughed
and
drew
herself
up
her
eyes
flashing
a
warm
glow
on
her
cheeks
who
does
love
me
not
now
perhaps
but
do
you
think
i
should
not
teach
him
to
love
me
make
him
love
me
look
at
me
father
he
looked
at
her
reluctantly
in
a
kind
of
dazed
admiration
and
resentment
do
you
think
any
man
could
resist
me
if
i
set
my
mind
upon
winning
him
no
oh
it
not
the
language
of
hysterical
vanity
i
know
my
power
every
woman
knows
how
far
her
power
will
go
let
me
have
him
to
myself
for
one
week
and
she
caught
her
breath
love
yes
he
shall
return
mine
tenfold
i
will
teach
him
she
caught
her
breath
again
and
pressed
her
hands
to
her
bosom
do
be
afraid
father
i
will
take
care
of
the
future
help
me
in
the
present
help
me
as
i
have
asked
you
by
god
you
ask
too
much
he
said
sternly
fiercely
she
stood
and
looked
at
him
the
colour
slowly
left
her
face
until
it
was
white
as
death
the
light
faded
from
her
eyes
until
they
were
dull
and
lifeless
the
red
of
her
lips
paled
and
the
lips
themselves
relaxed
and
drooped
and
as
he
looked
at
her
a
ghastly
fear
smote
his
heart
and
a
question
shot
into
and
a
question
shot
into
his
eyes
she
inclined
her
head
as
if
he
had
put
the
question
in
words
yes
she
said
i
shall
die
you
remember
my
mother
i
shall
follow
her
he
uttered
a
low
hoarse
cry
and
caught
her
hands
and
held
them
then
he
flung
them
from
him
and
standing
with
his
back
to
her
said
thickly
as
if
every
word
were
forced
from
him
you
shall
have
your
way
you
always
have
had
like
your
mother
before
you
you
always
will
but
mark
my
words
you
live
to
curse
the
hour
you
forced
me
to
do
this
she
drew
a
long
breath
it
was
almost
a
sigh
of
relief
and
she
laid
her
hands
on
his
arms
and
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
i
risk
that
she
said
with
a
tremulous
laugh
there
was
a
silence
for
a
moment
then
she
said
calmly
you
will
play
your
part
carefully
father
you
will
let
sir
stephen
think
that
stafford
desires
it
you
will
be
careful
he
turned
upon
her
with
an
oath
you
best
leave
it
to
me
he
said
savagely
i
try
and
save
you
from
shame
all
i
can
for
god
sake
go
and
leave
me
alone
chapter
xxi
while
stafford
was
dressing
for
dinner
that
night
and
wondering
whether
even
if
he
should
get
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
his
father
it
would
be
wise
to
tell
him
of
ida
howard
knocked
at
the
door
stafford
told
him
to
come
in
and
sent
measom
away
and
howard
who
was
already
dressed
sank
into
an
and
surveyed
his
friend
with
bland
approval
a
white
tie
staff
anything
on
yes
there
is
a
dance
replied
stafford
rather
absently
what
would
his
father
say
and
do
would
he
go
over
to
heron
hall
the
next
morning
yes
that
is
what
he
would
do
a
dance
is
that
all
from
the
undercurrent
of
suppressed
excitement
animating
most
of
the
guests
i
should
think
it
was
something
more
important
have
you
noticed
the
air
of
suspense
of
fluctuating
hope
and
doubt
triumph
and
despair
which
has
characterized
our
noble
band
of
financiers
during
the
last
few
days
stafford
shook
his
head
no
i
have
noticed
particularly
in
fact
i
scarcely
see
them
or
do
more
than
exchange
the
usual
greetings
they
seem
to
me
to
move
and
look
and
speak
just
about
as
usual
howard
smiled
to
be
young
and
happy
and
free
from
care
is
to
be
blind
puppies
for
instance
are
blind
stafford
grinned
that
complimentary
anyhow
what
do
you
think
is
up
i
think
sir
stephen
is
going
to
pull
off
his
great
event
to
make
his
grand
said
howard
so
you
find
a
terrier
improves
a
by
lying
on
it
tiny
had
coiled
himself
up
on
that
garment
which
measom
had
laid
ready
on
the
chair
and
was
lying
apparently
asleep
but
with
his
large
eyes
fixed
on
his
beloved
master
oh
he
a
peculiar
little
beast
and
is
always
getting
where
he
should
be
hi
young
man
get
off
my
coat
he
picked
the
terrier
up
and
threw
him
softly
on
the
bed
but
tiny
got
down
at
once
and
curled
himself
up
on
the
fur
mat
by
stafford
feet
seems
to
be
fond
of
you
strange
dog
said
howard
yes
i
think
sir
stephen
scheme
as
if
any
scheme
of
his
could
be
has
worked
out
successfully
and
i
should
be
surprised
if
the
financiers
had
a
meeting
and
the
floating
of
the
company
was
announced
oh
said
stafford
as
he
got
into
his
coat
yes
i
daresay
it
all
right
the
governor
seems
always
to
pull
it
off
howard
smiled
you
talk
as
if
an
affair
of
thousands
of
thousands
perhaps
millions
were
quite
a
bagatelle
he
said
my
dear
boy
do
you
understand
realise
the
importance
of
this
business
it
nothing
less
than
a
railway
from
stafford
nodded
oh
yes
you
told
me
about
it
it
a
very
big
thing
i
daresay
but
what
puzzles
me
is
why
the
governor
should
care
to
worry
about
it
he
has
money
enough
no
man
has
money
enough
said
howard
solemnly
but
no
matter
it
is
a
waste
of
time
to
discuss
philosophy
with
a
man
who
has
no
mind
above
fishing
and
dancing
by
the
way
how
many
times
do
you
intend
to
dance
with
the
grecian
goddess
meaning
said
stafford
miss
falconer
of
course
grecian
goddesses
are
not
so
common
my
dear
stafford
as
to
permit
of
more
than
one
in
a
i
sure
i
do
know
replied
stafford
eyeing
him
with
faint
surprise
what
the
devil
made
you
ask
me
that
howard
eyed
the
handsome
face
with
cynical
amusement
pardon
if
i
was
impertinent
but
i
assure
you
the
question
is
being
asked
amongst
themselves
by
all
the
women
in
the
house
stafford
stared
at
him
and
began
to
frown
with
perplexity
rather
than
anger
my
dear
stafford
i
know
that
you
are
not
possessed
of
a
particularly
brilliant
intellect
but
you
surely
possess
sufficient
intelligence
to
see
that
your
attentions
to
miss
falconer
are
somewhat
obvious
what
said
stafford
my
attentions
to
miss
falconer
are
you
chaffing
howard
not
in
the
least
it
usually
too
great
a
waste
of
time
with
you
my
dear
boy
you
do
listen
and
when
you
do
half
the
time
you
understand
no
i
quite
serious
but
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
said
her
attentions
to
you
it
would
have
been
more
correct
stafford
coloured
look
here
old
man
he
said
if
you
think
oh
dash
it
all
what
nonsense
it
is
miss
falconer
and
i
are
very
good
friends
and
of
course
i
like
to
talk
to
her
she
so
sharp
almost
as
smart
and
clever
as
you
are
when
she
likes
to
take
the
trouble
and
of
course
i
like
to
hear
her
sing
why
my
dear
howard
it
like
listening
to
one
of
the
big
operatic
swells
but
but
to
suggest
that
there
is
anything
that
there
is
any
reason
to
warn
me
oh
dash
it
come
off
it
old
man
you
chaffing
not
in
the
least
but
i
did
intend
any
warning
in
fact
i
am
in
honour
bound
to
refrain
from
anything
of
the
kind
in
honour
bound
said
stafford
howard
almost
blushed
oh
it
nothing
only
a
silly
wager
he
said
i
ca
tell
you
so
do
enquire
but
all
the
same
well
there
i
wo
say
more
if
you
are
sure
there
is
nothing
between
you
i
have
the
best
of
reasons
for
saying
so
said
stafford
carelessly
and
with
a
touch
of
colour
in
his
face
but
it
all
dashed
nonsense
the
women
always
think
there
something
serious
going
on
if
you
dance
twice
with
a
girl
or
sit
and
talk
to
her
for
half
an
hour
right
said
howard
rising
there
the
bell
as
howard
had
said
there
was
an
air
of
suppressed
excitement
about
the
people
and
it
was
not
confined
to
the
financiers
who
clustered
together
in
the
hall
and
discussed
and
talked
in
undertones
every
now
and
then
glancing
up
the
stairs
down
which
sir
stephen
would
presently
descend
most
of
the
other
guests
though
they
had
no
direct
and
personal
interest
in
the
great
scheme
more
or
less
had
heard
rumours
and
come
within
reflective
radius
of
the
excitement
as
for
the
rest
who
knew
nothing
or
cared
less
for
sir
stephen
railway
they
were
in
a
pleasant
condition
of
excitement
over
the
coming
dance
stafford
as
he
stood
in
the
hall
talking
about
the
night
programme
to
bertie
who
had
been
elected
by
common
and
tacit
consent
master
of
the
ceremonies
saw
maude
falconer
descending
the
stairs
she
was
even
more
exquisitely
dressed
than
usual
and
stafford
heard
some
of
the
women
and
men
murmur
admiringly
and
enviously
as
she
swept
across
the
hall
in
her
magnificent
her
diamonds
for
which
she
was
famous
glittering
in
her
hair
on
her
white
throat
and
on
her
slender
wrists
the
dress
was
a
mixture
of
grey
and
black
which
would
have
looked
on
anyone
else
less
beautiful
but
its
strange
tints
harmonised
with
her
superb
and
classic
class
of
beauty
and
she
looked
like
a
vision
of
loveliness
which
might
well
dazzle
the
eyes
of
the
beholders
she
paused
in
her
progress
it
might
almost
be
called
a
triumphant
one
for
the
other
women
looks
were
eloquent
of
dismay
and
looked
at
stafford
with
the
slow
smile
which
had
come
into
her
face
of
late
when
she
spoke
to
him
have
you
seen
my
father
has
he
come
down
mr
orme
she
asked
no
said
stafford
he
looked
at
her
as
a
man
does
when
he
admires
a
woman
dress
and
forgetting
howard
words
of
warning
said
what
a
splendacious
frock
miss
falconer
do
you
like
it
i
am
glad
she
said
i
had
my
doubts
but
now
her
eyes
rested
on
his
for
a
moment
then
she
passed
on
i
should
like
to
have
to
pay
miss
falconer
dress
bill
remarked
a
young
married
woman
looking
after
her
that
as
you
call
it
in
your
masculine
ignorance
must
have
cost
a
small
fortune
stafford
laughed
we
men
always
put
our
foot
in
it
when
we
talk
about
a
woman
dress
he
said
a
moment
after
the
dinner
was
announced
and
sir
stephen
who
had
come
down
at
the
last
moment
as
he
went
up
to
take
in
lady
clansford
nodded
to
stafford
and
smiled
significantly
he
was
as
carefully
dressed
as
usual
but
on
his
face
and
in
his
eyes
particularly
was
an
expression
of
satisfaction
and
anticipatory
triumph
which
was
too
obvious
to
escape
the
notice
of
but
very
few
he
was
not
loud
at
dinner
but
talked
even
more
fluently
than
usual
and
once
or
twice
his
fine
eyes
swept
the
long
table
with
a
victorious
masterful
glance
directly
the
ladies
had
gone
the
little
knot
of
financiers
drew
up
nearer
to
their
host
and
griffenberg
raised
his
eyebrows
interrogatively
sir
stephen
nodded
yes
he
said
in
an
undertone
it
all
right
i
heard
this
morning
my
man
will
be
down
with
the
final
decision
by
a
special
train
which
ought
to
land
him
about
midnight
we
meet
in
the
library
say
at
half
past
twelve
and
get
the
thing
finished

there
was
but
a
short
stay
made
in
the
and
before
ten
the
guests
streamed
into
the
magnificent
there
were
a
number
of
the
neighbouring
gentry
who
were
making
their
acquaintance
with
the
villa
for
the
first
time
and
they
regarded
the
splendour
around
them
with
an
amazement
which
was
not
without
reason
for
the
artistically
designed
and
shaded
electric
lamps
the
beautiful
rooms
with
their
chaste
yet
effective
decorations
on
which
money
had
been
lavished
like
water
were
seen
to
their
greatest
advantage
and
the
vaynes
the
bannerdales
and
the
local
gentry
generally
exchanged
glances
and
murmured
exclamations
of
surprise
and
admiration
and
wondered
whether
there
could
be
any
end
to
the
wealth
of
a
man
who
could
raise
such
a
palace
in
so
short
a
time
from
the
gallery
of
the
famous
band
every
man
of
which
was
a
musician
presently
began
to
send
forth
the
sweet
strains
of
a
waldteufel
waltz
and
stafford
found
lady
clansford
for
the
first
dance
though
he
had
paid
little
attention
to
howard
remarks
about
maude
falconer
he
remembered
them
and
he
did
not
ask
her
for
a
dance
until
the
ball
had
been
running
about
an
hour
then
he
went
up
to
where
she
was
standing
talking
to
lord
bunnerdale
her
last
partner
his
lordship
and
stafford
had
already
met
and
lord
bannerdale
who
admired
and
liked
stafford
nodded
pleasantly
i
was
just
saying
to
miss
falconer
that
i
wish
fate
had
made
me
a
great
financier
instead
of
a
country
squire
orme
by
jove
this
place
is
a
perfect
er
dream
and
when
i
think
of
my
damp
old
house
what
frightful
language
said
stafford
lord
bannerdale
laughed
if
miss
falconer
had
not
been
present
i
might
just
as
well
have
used
the
other
word
i
say
i
ca
help
envying
your
father
that
wand
with
which
he
manages
to
raise
such
marvels
i
going
to
find
him
and
tell
him
so
a
dance
said
maude
as
stafford
proffered
his
request
yes
i
have
one
only
one
it
is
this
he
put
his
arm
round
her
and
as
he
did
so
her
eyes
half
closed
and
her
lip
quivered
at
his
touch
stafford
waltzed
well
and
maude
was
far
and
away
the
best
dancer
in
the
room
they
moved
as
one
body
in
the
slow
and
graceful
modern
waltz
and
stafford
in
the
enjoyment
of
this
perfect
poetry
of
motion
forgot
everything
even
his
partner
but
he
came
back
from
his
reverie
as
she
suddenly
paused
are
you
tired
he
asked
by
george
how
perfectly
you
waltz
never
enjoyed
a
dance
more
a
faint
colour
rose
to
her
face
it
had
been
very
pale
a
moment
before
and
she
looked
at
him
with
an
earnestness
which
rather
puzzled
him
they
say
that
to
agree
in
waltzing
is
an
unfortunate
thing
for
those
who
wish
to
be
friends
do
they
he
said
with
a
smile
i
wonder
who
it
is
says
all
those
silly
things
now
what
nonsense
this
one
is
for
instance
to
enjoy
a
dance
as
i
just
enjoyed
this
puts
a
man
in
a
good
temper
with
himself
and
his
partner
and
of
course
makes
him
feel
more
friendly
i
not
a
good
logician
but
that
sounds
all
right
does
it
yes
she
said
in
a
low
voice
no
i
wo
dance
any
more
i
i
am
a
little
tired
and
disinclined
for
dancing
all
right
he
said
i
sorry
both
that
you
wo
dance
and
the
cause
you
have
been
doing
too
much
too
long
a
ride
i
expect
these
hills
are
rather
trying
to
those
who
are
not
used
to
them
shall
we
go
and
sit
in
that
recess
i
bring
you
some
wine
no
thanks
she
said
quickly
she
could
not
bear
him
to
leave
her
he
led
her
to
one
of
the
recesses
leading
on
to
the
fernery
and
found
her
a
seat
near
a
softly
plashing
fountain
the
lights
were
shaded
with
silk
and
threw
a
soft
warm
glow
upon
her
face
and
snowy
neck
for
the
hundredth
time
as
he
looked
at
her
he
thought
how
beautiful
she
was
and
for
the
hundredth
time
compared
her
to
ida
of
course
to
his
sweetheart
advantage
she
leant
back
in
the
luxurious
lounge
with
her
eyes
bent
on
her
jewelled
fan
and
seemed
lost
in
thought
then
suddenly
she
said
do
you
know
how
long
we
have
been
here
orme
it
is
a
tremendous
time
i
told
my
father
that
we
must
take
our
departure
oh
no
he
said
pray
do
think
of
it
if
you
care
to
stay
if
you
are
happy
you
would
be
a
very
serious
loss
to
us
if
i
care
if
i
am
happy
she
laughed
a
low
strange
laugh
and
raised
her
eyes
to
his
for
an
instant
do
you
think
i
have
not
been
happy
oh
i
hope
so
he
said
my
father
would
be
awfully
cut
up
if
he
thought
you
had
not
if
he
thought
there
had
been
anything
to
prevent
your
being
happy
he
would
remove
it
even
if
it
it
were
one
of
those
mountains
outside
he
added
with
a
laugh
you
admire
your
father
she
said
you
are
fond
of
him
stafford
nodded
it
seemed
an
unnecessary
question
rather
he
said
there
never
was
such
a
father
as
mine
and
sir
stephen
thinks
there
never
was
such
a
son
as
his
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
suppose
you
are
both
quite
willing
to
make
sacrifices
for
each
other
would
you
do
would
you
give
up
much
for
your
father
mr
orme
she
raised
her
eyes
again
and
let
them
rest
on
his
stafford
tried
to
smile
but
his
face
grew
grave
just
my
life
if
it
were
any
use
to
him
he
said
her
lips
moved
that
is
so
little
she
said
we
can
all
die
for
those
we
love
but
few
of
us
can
live
for
them
go
on
living
a
life
which
has
to
be
moulded
to
a
plan
bent
on
another
will
could
you
do
that
yes
he
said
after
a
pause
there
is
no
sacrifice
i
would
not
make
for
my
father
sake
but
he
laughed
and
cleared
the
gravity
from
his
brow
all
the
sacrifice
seems
to
be
on
his
side
he
has
worked
for
me
all
his
life
is
working
still
i
afraid
here
is
father
miss
falconer
and
looking
for
you
i
afraid
ralph
falconer
stood
in
the
doorway
looking
round
his
heavy
face
seeming
heavier
than
usual
his
thick
lips
drooping
as
he
saw
the
two
young
people
his
lips
straightened
and
he
went
over
to
them
slowly
i
hope
you
are
not
going
to
take
miss
falconer
away
sir
said
stafford
ralph
falconer
shook
his
head
and
avoiding
his
daughter
eye
said
sir
stephen
wants
to
see
you
in
the
library
orme
and
wishes
me
to
accompany
you
certainly
if
miss
falconer
will
excuse
me
he
rose
and
he
fancied
her
hand
trembled
slightly
as
it
rested
almost
as
lightly
as
a
feather
on
his
arm
i
take
you
to
lady
clansford
there
is
no
need
here
is
my
next
partner
she
said
as
the
beautiful
bountiful
bertie
came
up
smiling
and
buoyant
anything
the
matter
sir
asked
stafford
as
he
and
falconer
made
their
way
round
the
room
through
which
was
floating
the
last
thing
in
waltzes
a
soft
and
sensuous
melody
which
sang
the
soul
to
rest
i
think
not
a
matter
of
business
i
think
said
ralph
falconer
his
secretary
murray
has
just
come
from
london
it
may
be
something
to
do
with
the
papers
he
had
brought
stafford
nodded
though
the
explanation
seemed
unsatisfactory
for
what
concern
had
stafford
with
the
papers
as
they
went
through
the
hall
they
saw
the
financiers
clustered
together
with
an
expectant
air
as
if
they
were
waiting
for
the
result
of
the
arrival
of
the
man
by
the
special
train
and
they
stared
at
falconer
and
exchanged
glances
as
he
and
stafford
passed
them
and
went
to
the
library
door
sir
stephen
voice
came
cheerily
in
response
to
stafford
knock
and
stafford
entered
falconer
following
him
with
bent
head
and
the
same
heavy
look
sir
stephen
was
sitting
at
the
table
before
a
despatch
box
and
he
held
out
his
hand
and
uttered
a
little
cry
of
pleasure
as
he
saw
who
it
was
stafford
my
boy
you
could
not
have
come
at
a
better
moment
go
falconer
i
like
you
to
hear
me
tell
him
the
good
news
i
got
it
here
he
patted
the
despatch
case
this
is
pandora
box
staff
with
something
better
than
hope
at
the
bottom
certainty
he
laughed
quietly
confidently
and
his
bright
eyes
flashed
under
their
dark
brows
from
one
to
the
other
murray
has
just
arrived
falconer
with
the
good
news
he
took
out
the
gold
chain
to
which
the
key
of
the
despatch
box
was
fastened
and
inserted
it
in
the
lock
the
good
news
staff
i
have
bothered
and
bored
you
with
details
but
you
know
my
dear
boy
that
i
have
had
a
big
scheme
on
hand
for
some
time
past
a
very
big
scheme
it
has
been
rather
a
business
but
i
think
i
have
managed
to
pull
it
off
eh
falconer
the
last
day
or
two
has
been
one
of
suspense
great
suspense
but
success
has
come
you
do
care
for
money
staff
i
know
nor
do
i
honestly
no
not
for
the
mere
money
but
for
what
it
can
buy
and
bring
but
even
you
will
have
some
respect
for
a
million
and
a
half
staff
he
laughed
a
large
sum
and
this
means
more
than
money
there
ought
to
be
something
in
the
way
of
an
honour
falconer
nodded
the
scheme
is
successful
your
father
will
be
a
peer
of
the
realm
stafford
he
said
drily
with
an
emphasis
on
the
if
echoed
sir
stephen
laughing
and
nodding
stafford
could
see
by
the
brilliance
of
his
eyes
the
flush
on
his
face
that
he
was
excited
and
was
struggling
with
excitement
if
falconer
nodded
at
the
and
with
another
bantering
laugh
sir
stephen
opened
it
and
took
out
a
large
envelope
he
held
this
for
a
moment
poised
between
finger
and
thumb
then
he
tore
it
open
and
took
out
a
sheet
of
paper
and
turned
his
flashing
eyes
from
the
two
men
to
the
document
he
rose
for
a
moment
with
the
smile
still
on
his
face
then
they
saw
it
fade
saw
the
flush
slowly
disappear
and
in
its
place
a
dull
grey
steal
over
the
face
stafford
startled
went
round
to
him
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
what
is
the
matter
sir
he
asked
bad
news
sir
stephen
looked
at
him
as
if
he
did
not
see
him
then
turned
his
eyes
upon
falconer
who
stood
regarding
him
with
a
fixed
sardonic
gaze
hast
thou
found
me
oh
mine
enemy
came
at
last
from
sir
white
lips
stafford
looked
from
one
to
the
other
what
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
what
do
you
mean
he
said
sir
stephen
raised
his
hand
and
pointed
to
ralph
falconer
this
this
man
he
gasped
then
he
shook
his
head
impatiently
as
if
he
were
fighting
against
his
weakness
this
man
falconer
has
betrayed
me
stafford
drew
himself
up
as
he
stood
by
his
father
side
and
eyed
falconer
sternly
will
you
explain
mr
falconer
he
said
certainly
said
falconer
with
a
grim
calmness
your
father
uses
unwarrantably
strong
language
orme
for
an
action
of
mine
which
is
quite
a
common
one
amongst
business
men
no
gasped
sir
stephen
as
he
sank
back
into
the
chair
treachery
is
not
common
treachery
is
the
wrong
word
said
falconer
as
coldly
as
before
better
let
me
explain
to
stafford
i
can
do
so
in
a
few
words
orme
the
fact
is
your
father
and
i
have
been
quite
unknown
to
each
other
engaged
in
the
same
scheme
it
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
acquisition
of
certain
land
and
rights
which
carry
with
them
the
privilege
of
constructing
a
railway
in
the
most
promising
part
of
south
africa
sir
stephen
leant
forward
his
head
on
his
hands
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
heavy
stolid
face
of
the
speaker
the
face
which
the
keen
eyes
flashed
under
the
lowered
lids
with
a
gleam
of
power
and
triumph
your
father
had
reason
to
hope
that
he
would
acquire
those
lands
and
rights
he
did
not
know
that
i
had
been
waiting
for
some
years
past
to
obtain
them
if
knowledge
is
power
and
money
ignorance
is
impotence
and
ruin
my
knowledge
against
your
father
ignorance
has
given
me
the
victory
last
night
i
gained
my
point
the
news
to
that
effect
is
no
doubt
contained
in
that
document
it
was
a
question
of
price
it
always
is
i
knew
your
father
bid
and
i
went
a
few
thousands
higher
and
got
the
prize
that
the
story
in
a
nutshell
of
course
there
are
a
number
of
complications
and
details
but
i
spare
you
them
in
fact
i
do
suppose
you
understand
them
it
is
a
mere
matter
of
business
no
of
revenge
said
sir
stephen
hollow
voice
stafford
years
ago
i
did
this
man
a
wrong
i
i
have
repented
i
would
have
made
atonement
reparation
but
he
put
the
offer
aside
here
in
this
house
he
professed
to
have
forgiven
and
forgotten
professed
friendship
it
was
a
piece
of
treachery
and
deceit
under
that
specious
mask
behind
that
screen
he
has
worked
my
ruin
ruin
said
stafford
in
a
low
voice
surely
you
exaggerate
father
you
mean
that
you
will
lose
a
lot
of
money
oh
i
can
understand
that
of
course
but
not
ruin
yes
said
sir
stephen
hoarsely
if
you
doubt
it
look
at
him
falconer
was
standing
with
a
sardonic
smile
in
his
eyes
stafford
started
is
this
true
mr
falconer
falconer
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
said
slowly
grimly
in
a
sense
yes
your
father
fate
lies
in
my
hands
in
your
hands
echoed
stafford
with
amazement
sir
stephen
groaned
and
rose
supporting
himself
by
the
arm
of
the
chair
it
is
true
stafford
he
he
has
planned
it
with
the
skill
of
a
general
a
napoleon
i
see
it
all
now
it
is
all
plain
to
me
you
held
my
shares
and
securities
of
course
falconer
falconer
nodded
of
course
he
said
drily
and
you
have
run
them
down
to
meet
this
scheme
of
yours
yes
of
course
said
falconer
again
my
dear
steve
sir
stephen
pardon
your
fate
as
i
have
said
is
in
my
hands
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
you
had
your
turn
some
years
ago
out
there
he
waved
his
hand
it
is
my
turn
now
you
ca
complain
do
you
admit
the
justice
of
the
thing
sir
stephen
sank
into
a
chair
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
for
a
moment
then
he
looked
up
at
stafford
he
right
it
was
his
turn
he
has
taken
it
and
with
it
every
penny
i
possess
it
means
ruin
complete
ruin
worse
even
than
the
loss
of
every
penny
for
for
i
god
help
me
ca
afford
to
go
into
court
and
have
the
past
raked
up
and
he
knows
it
he
knows
it
stafford
the
sight
of
the
old
man
anguish
almost
drove
stafford
mad
have
you
no
mercy
sir
he
said
to
falconer
grant
that
my
father
had
injured
you
is
this
rather
too
awful
a
revenge
to
exact
i
i
i
do
understand
all
that
i
have
heard
but
but
an
oath
broke
from
his
hot
lips
will
nothing
less
than
the
ruin
of
my
father
satisfy
you
falconer
looked
from
one
to
the
other
and
moistened
his
lips
while
his
hands
gripped
each
other
behind
his
back
i
think
you
have
misunderstood
me
he
said
in
a
dry
harsh
voice
i
have
no
intention
of
ruining
your
father
or
of
depriving
him
of
his
good
name
mind
if
i
did
i
should
only
be
taking
my
pound
of
flesh
and
i
may
tell
you
that
before
i
entered
this
house
this
afternoon
i
had
resolved
to
have
it
but
i
heard
something
that
induced
me
to
change
my
mind
sir
stephen
leant
forward
his
eyes
fixed
eagerly
on
the
speaker
and
stafford
in
his
anxiety
held
his
breath
and
pressed
his
shoulder
encouragingly
you
heard
something
sir
stafford
asked
as
calmly
as
he
could
falconer
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
said
yes
i
heard
that
you
were
desirous
of
marrying
my
daughter
maude
orme
and
i
need
not
say
that
a
man
does
not
ruin
his
there
was
an
intense
silence
stafford
stood
as
if
he
were
turned
to
stone
as
if
he
were
trying
to
persuade
himself
that
he
had
misunderstood
the
meaning
of
falconer
words
marry
maude
falconer
he
was
he
dreaming
or
was
this
man
who
stood
regarding
him
with
cold
glittering
eyes
mad
chapter
xxii
we
do
not
nowadays
strike
attitudes
or
ejaculate
and
swear
when
we
are
startled
or
shocked
stafford
stood
perfectly
still
still
as
a
piece
of
stonehenge
and
gazed
with
an
expressionless
countenance
at
falconer
that
the
man
was
indeed
and
in
truth
mad
occurred
to
him
for
a
moment
then
he
thought
there
must
be
some
mistake
that
falconer
had
made
a
blunder
in
the
name
and
that
it
was
a
case
of
mistaking
his
man
but
as
the
moments
fled
and
the
two
elder
men
gazed
at
him
as
if
expecting
him
to
speak
he
remembered
howard
warning
the
colour
rushed
to
his
face
and
his
eyes
dropped
merciful
heaven
was
the
man
speaking
the
truth
when
he
said
that
he
stafford
was
in
love
with
maude
falconer
his
face
was
hot
and
scarlet
for
a
moment
then
it
grew
pale
under
the
shame
of
the
thought
that
he
should
have
to
correct
the
impression
decline
so
to
speak
the
implied
honour
sir
stephen
was
the
first
to
speak
he
had
sunk
back
in
his
chair
but
was
now
leaning
forward
again
his
hands
gripping
the
table
stafford
he
said
still
thickly
but
with
the
beginning
of
a
note
of
relief
in
his
voice
i
did
not
know
this
you
did
not
tell
me
stafford
turned
to
him
helplessly
what
could
he
say
before
falconer
the
girl
father
you
did
not
tell
me
but
i
do
complain
my
boy
said
sir
stephen
you
were
right
to
choose
your
own
time
young
people
like
to
keep
their
secret
to
themselves
as
long
as
possible
falconer
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
an
impassive
countenance
i
feel
that
i
am
rather
he
said
that
i
have
spoken
rather
prematurely
but
my
hand
was
forced
orme
i
wanted
to
set
your
mind
at
rest
to
show
you
that
even
if
i
hankered
after
revenge
it
was
impossible
under
the
circumstances
he
glanced
at
stafford
it
not
the
first
time
in
history
that
the
young
people
have
played
the
part
of
this
is
a
kind
of
romeo
and
juliet
business
is
it
i
leave
you
and
stafford
to
talk
it
over
he
moved
to
the
door
but
with
his
hand
upon
it
paused
and
looked
round
at
them
again
i
ought
to
aid
that
like
most
modern
fathers
i
am
entirely
in
the
hands
of
my
daughter
i
ca
go
so
far
as
to
say
orme
that
if
i
had
been
permitted
to
choose
i
should
have
chosen
a
son
of
yours
for
my
but
you
see
maude
does
give
me
the
option
the
young
people
have
taken
the
bit
between
their
teeth
and
bolted
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
thing
we
have
to
do
is
to
sit
tight
and
look
as
cheerful
as
possible
oh
one
word
more
he
added
in
a
tone
of
course
i
make
over
this
concession
to
you
orme
just
taking
the
share
i
should
have
received
if
you
had
won
the
game
and
i
had
only
stood
in
as
proposed
that
is
to
say
you
will
be
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
if
you
had
won
all
along
the
line
as
you
thought
you
had
and
with
a
nod
which
included
father
and
son
he
went
out
stafford
unconsciously
drew
back
a
little
so
that
he
was
almost
behind
sir
stephen
who
had
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
and
sat
perfectly
motionless
like
a
man
looking
back
at
some
terrible
danger
from
which
he
had
only
escaped
by
the
skin
of
his
teeth
then
he
dropped
his
hands
from
his
face
and
drew
a
long
breath
the
kind
of
breath
a
man
draws
who
has
been
battling
with
the
waves
and
finds
himself
on
the
shore
exhausted
but
still
alive
stafford
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
sir
stephen
started
and
looked
up
at
him
as
if
he
had
forgotten
his
presence
a
flush
as
if
of
shame
came
upon
the
great
financier
face
and
he
frowned
at
the
papers
lying
before
him
where
they
had
dropped
from
his
hand
what
an
escape
stafford
he
said
his
voice
still
rather
thick
and
with
a
tremour
of
excitement
and
even
exhaustion
in
its
usually
clear
and
steady
tone
i
am
ashamed
my
boy
that
you
should
have
been
a
witness
to
my
defeat
it
humiliates
mortifies
me
do
let
that
worry
you
father
said
stafford
scarcely
knowing
what
he
said
for
the
tumult
in
his
brain
the
dread
at
his
heart
it
is
not
the
first
defeat
i
have
suffered
in
my
life
like
other
successful
men
i
have
known
what
it
is
to
fall
and
i
have
laughed
and
got
up
and
shaken
the
dust
off
myself
so
to
speak
and
gone
at
the
fight
again
all
the
harder
and
more
determined
because
of
the
reverse
but
this
this
would
have
crushed
me
utterly
and
forever
do
you
mean
that
it
would
have
ruined
you
completely
father
said
stafford
completely
replied
sir
stephen
in
a
low
voice
his
head
drooping
i
had
staked
everything
on
this
venture
had
staked
even
more
than
i
possessed
i
can
not
explain
all
the
details
the
ramifications
of
the
scheme
which
i
have
been
working
you
could
not
understand
them
if
i
were
to
talk
to
you
for
a
week
suffice
it
that
if
i
had
failed
to
get
this
concession
i
should
have
been
an
utterly
ruined
man
should
have
had
to
go
through
the
bankruptcy
court
should
have
been
left
without
a
penny
and
not
only
that
i
should
have
dragged
a
great
many
of
the
men
of
the
friends
who
had
trusted
to
my
ability
who
have
believed
in
me
into
the
same
pit
not
only
such
men
as
griffenberg
and
wirsch
and
the
beltons
but
the
plaistows
the
clansdales
and
the
fitzharfords
they
would
have
suffered
with
me
would
have
considered
themselves
betrayed
stafford
drew
a
long
breath
there
seemed
to
him
still
a
chance
of
saving
himself
the
girl
he
loved
above
all
his
honour
but
even
if
it
were
so
father
he
said
other
men
have
failed
other
men
have
been
defeated
ruined
and
left
penniless
and
yet
have
risen
and
shaken
the
dust
from
them
and
fought
their
way
again
to
the
heights
you
not
an
old
man
you
are
strong
and
clever
and
you
are
not
alone
he
said
in
a
lower
voice
i
not
much
use
i
know
but
i
try
and
help
you
all
i
can
i
often
felt
ashamed
of
myself
for
living
such
an
idle
useless
life
often
felt
that
i
ought
to
do
something
to
justify
my
existence
there
a
chance
now
at
any
rate
there
an
occasion
a
necessity
for
my
waking
up
and
stepping
into
the
ring
to
do
a
little
fighting
on
my
own
account
we
may
be
beaten
by
falconer
but
do
say
we
utterly
crushed
that
does
sound
like
you
sir
and
i
do
understand
why
you
should
chuck
up
the
sponge
so
quickly
sir
stephen
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
stafford
with
a
curious
expression
of
mingled
surprise
and
apprehension
what
is
it
you
are
saying
stafford
he
asked
what
is
it
you
mean
i
do
understand
we
not
beaten
ralph
falconer
has
offered
to
make
the
concession
over
to
me
and
no
one
need
know
that
i
have
failed
that
he
had
stolen
the
march
on
me
you
heard
what
he
said
that
you
were
in
love
with
his
daughter
maude
and
that
of
course
he
could
not
injure
his
future
stafford
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
i
know
that
this
has
touched
your
pride
i
can
give
a
pretty
good
guess
as
to
how
proud
you
are
but
for
god
sake
do
let
your
pride
stand
in
the
way
of
this
arrangement
but
stafford
began
for
he
felt
that
he
could
not
longer
keep
back
the
truth
that
his
father
must
be
told
not
only
that
there
was
nothing
between
maude
and
himself
but
that
he
loved
ida
heron
but
before
he
could
utter
another
word
sir
stephen
stopped
before
him
and
with
hands
thrown
out
appealingly
and
with
a
look
of
terror
and
agony
in
his
face
cried
in
broken
accents
if
you
going
to
raise
any
obstacle
stafford
prompted
by
your
pride
for
god
sake
do
say
the
word
you
do
know
you
understand
you
speak
of
ruin
as
if
it
meant
only
the
loss
of
money
the
loss
of
every
penny
he
laughed
almost
hysterically
and
his
lips
twitched
do
you
think
i
should
care
for
that
except
for
your
sake
no
a
thousand
times
no
i
young
still
i
could
begin
the
world
again
yes
and
conquer
it
as
i
have
done
before
but
his
voice
sank
and
he
look
round
the
room
with
a
stealthy
glance
which
shocked
and
startled
stafford
the
ruin
ralph
falconer
threatens
me
with
means
more
than
the
loss
of
money
it
means
the
loss
of
everything
of
friends
of
good
name
of
hope
stafford
started
and
his
face
grew
a
trifle
hard
and
sir
stephen
saw
it
and
made
a
despairing
appealing
gesture
with
his
hand
for
god
sake
do
turn
away
from
me
my
boy
do
judge
me
harshly
you
ca
judge
me
fairly
from
your
standpoint
your
life
has
been
a
totally
different
one
from
mine
has
been
lived
under
different
circumstances
you
have
never
known
the
temptations
to
which
i
have
been
subjected
your
life
has
been
an
easy
one
surrounded
by
honour
while
mine
has
been
spent
half
the
time
grubbing
in
the
dust
and
the
mire
for
gold
and
the
rest
fighting
sometimes
with
one
hand
tied
behind
me
against
the
men
who
would
have
robbed
me
of
it
i
have
had
to
fight
them
with
their
own
weapons
sometimes
they
have
been
clean
sometimes
it
has
been
necessary
to
do
to
do
things
god
stafford
do
turn
away
from
me
i
would
have
kept
this
from
you
if
i
could
but
i
am
obliged
to
tell
you
now
ralph
falconer
knows
all
the
details
of
my
past
he
knows
of
things
which
which
if
they
were
known
to
the
world
would
stain
the
name
i
have
raised
to
honour
would
make
it
necessary
for
me
to
hide
my
head
in
a
suicide
grave
a
low
cry
burst
from
stafford
lips
and
he
sank
into
a
chair
and
bowed
his
head
upon
his
hands
sir
stephen
stood
a
little
way
off
and
looked
at
him
for
a
minute
then
he
advanced
slowly
half
timidly
and
ashamedly
and
laid
a
trembling
hand
on
stafford
shoulder
forgive
me
stafford
he
said
in
a
low
broken
voice
i
was
obliged
to
tell
you
i
have
kept
it
from
you
you
would
never
have
known
but
falconer
has
forced
my
hand
i
was
bound
to
show
you
how
necessary
it
was
that
we
should
have
him
as
friend
instead
of
foe
you
are
not
ashamed
of
me
my
boy
you
wo
go
back
on
me
in
the
stress
and
strain
of
his
emotion
the
old
digger
slang
came
readily
to
his
lips
stafford
took
one
hand
from
his
face
and
held
it
out
and
his
father
grasped
it
clinging
to
it
as
a
drowning
man
clings
to
a
rock
god
bless
you
my
boy
he
said
i
might
have
known
you
would
turn
your
back
upon
me
i
might
have
known
that
you
remember
that
i
fighting
for
myself
only
but
for
the
son
i
so
proud
of
i
know
i
know
sir
said
stafford
almost
inaudibly
sir
stephen
hung
his
hand
released
it
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
again
fighting
for
composure
and
facing
the
situation
after
the
manner
of
his
kind
like
all
successful
adventurers
he
was
always
ready
to
look
on
the
bright
side
he
came
back
to
stafford
and
patted
him
gently
on
the
shoulder
try
and
forget
what
i
said
about
about
the
past
stafford
he
said
let
us
look
at
the
future
your
future
after
all
we
not
beaten
it
a
compromise
it
an
alliance
his
voice
grew
more
cheerful
his
eyes
began
to
brighten
with
something
of
their
wonted
fire
and
it
a
bright
future
staff
you
chosen
a
beautiful
girl
a
singularly
beautiful
and
girl
it
true
she
only
ralph
falconer
daughter
and
that
i
loftier
ideas
for
you
but
let
that
pass
maude
is
a
young
lady
who
can
hold
her
own
against
the
best
and
the
highest
falconer
must
be
rich
or
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
have
managed
this
thing
would
not
have
been
able
to
beat
me
with
your
money
and
hers
you
can
go
as
far
as
you
please
he
took
a
turn
up
and
down
the
room
again
a
flush
on
the
face
that
had
been
pallid
only
a
minute
or
two
ago
his
finely
shaped
head
thrown
back
yes
stafford
i
should
like
you
to
have
married
into
the
nobility
in
my
eyes
there
is
no
one
too
high
in
rank
for
you
but
no
matter
the
title
will
come
they
can
not
do
less
than
offer
me
a
peerage
this
railway
will
be
of
too
much
service
to
the
government
for
them
to
pass
me
over
the
peerage
must
come
there
is
no
chance
of
my
losing
it
why
yes
the
future
is
as
bright
as
the
sunlight
on
a
june
morning
you
will
have
the
girl
you
love
i
shall
have
the
peerage
to
leave
to
you
i
shall
have
not
lived
and
struggled
and
fought
in
vain
i
shall
have
left
a
name
unstained
unsullied
to
the
son
i
love
there
was
a
catch
in
his
voice
and
it
broke
as
he
turned
suddenly
with
outstretched
hand
why
god
forgive
me
stafford
my
boy
i
talking
of
what
i
done
for
you
and
what
i
meaning
to
do
as
if
i
were
forgetting
what
you
are
doing
for
me
stafford
a
father
often
finds
that
he
has
worked
for
his
children
only
to
meet
with
ingratitude
and
to
be
repaid
by
indifference
but
you
have
returned
my
affection
oh
i
seen
it
felt
it
my
boy
and
now
as
fate
would
have
it
you
are
actually
saving
my
honour
shielding
my
good
name
coming
between
me
and
utter
ruin
god
bless
you
stafford
god
bless
you
and
send
you
all
the
happiness
you
deserve
and
i
wish
you
a
silence
fell
into
the
room
there
floated
the
soft
languorous
strains
of
a
waltz
the
murmur
of
voices
the
laughter
of
some
of
the
people
in
the
conservatory
stafford
sat
his
head
still
upon
his
hands
as
if
her
were
half
stupefied
and
indeed
he
was
he
felt
like
a
man
who
has
been
seized
by
the
tentacles
of
an
octopus
unable
to
struggle
unable
to
move
and
incapable
even
of
protest
sir
stephen
had
spoken
of
fate
fate
held
stafford
under
its
iron
heel
and
the
mockery
of
fate
laughter
mingled
with
the
strains
of
the
waltz
the
murmur
of
voices
unconsciously
he
rose
and
looked
round
as
if
half
dazed
and
sir
stephen
came
to
him
and
laid
both
hands
on
his
shoulders
i
must
not
keep
you
any
longer
my
dear
boy
he
said
with
a
fond
proud
look
i
must
not
forget
i
am
keeping
you
from
her
she
will
be
missing
you
wanting
you
you
have
kept
your
secret
well
stafford
though
once
or
twice
i
have
fancied
when
i
have
seen
you
together
but
it
was
only
a
fancy
are
you
going
to
announce
the
engagement
tonight
it
is
rather
a
good
opportunity
is
it
it
will
make
the
night
memorable
the
music
danced
madly
through
stafford
brain
as
his
father
waited
looking
at
him
smilingly
what
should
he
say
not
sir
he
answered
i
should
like
to
speak
to
miss
falconer
first
sir
stephen
nodded
and
smiled
i
understand
my
boy
he
said
this
kind
of
thing
is
not
done
now
as
it
was
in
my
time
we
used
to
take
the
girl
of
our
choice
by
the
hand
and
throw
back
our
heads
and
announce
the
fact
that
we
have
secured
the
prize
with
all
the
pride
imaginable
but
that
all
altered
now
i
suppose
the
new
way
is
more
delicate
more
refined
at
any
rate
you
belong
to
the
new
age
and
have
a
right
to
follow
its
manners
and
customs
so
you
shall
say
nothing
unless
you
like
and
if
i
am
asked
why
i
look
so
happy
so
free
from
care
i
must
say
that
it
is
because
the
great
railway
scheme
is
settled
and
that
i
have
won
all
along
the
line
as
he
said
the
last
words
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
murray
entered
with
an
injured
look
griffenberg
and
baron
wirsch
would
like
to
see
you
sir
stephen
he
said
significantly
sir
stephen
sprang
to
the
table
almost
with
the
alertness
of
a
boy
and
caught
up
the
papers
lying
on
his
desk
all
right
murray
he
cried
sorry
i
late
been
having
a
talk
with
stafford
come
on
with
a
nod
a
smile
a
tender
look
of
love
and
gratitude
to
stafford
the
brilliant
adventurer
once
more
thrown
by
the
buoyant
wave
upon
the
shore
of
safety
and
success
went
out
to
communicate
that
success
to
his
coadjutors
stafford
sank
into
his
father
chair
and
with
his
hands
thrust
deep
in
his
pockets
and
his
chin
upon
his
chest
tried
to
clear
his
brain
to
free
his
mind
from
all
side
issues
and
to
face
the
fact
that
he
had
tacitly
agreed
that
by
his
silence
he
had
consented
to
marry
maude
falconer
but
oh
how
hard
it
was
to
think
clearly
with
the
vision
of
that
girlish
face
floating
before
him
the
exquisitely
beautiful
face
with
its
violet
eyes
now
arched
and
merry
now
soft
and
pleading
now
tender
with
the
tenderness
of
a
girl
first
true
divinely
trusting
love
he
was
looking
at
the
before
him
but
a
mist
rose
between
it
and
his
eyes
and
he
saw
the
and
the
darling
of
his
heart
riding
down
it
the
sunlight
on
her
face
the
soft
tendrils
of
hair
blown
rough
by
the
wind
the
red
lips
apart
with
a
smile
the
little
grave
smile
which
he
had
kissed
away
into
deeper
still
sweeter
seriousness
and
he
had
lost
her
oh
god
how
he
loved
her
and
he
had
lost
her
forever
there
was
no
hope
for
him
he
must
save
his
father
not
his
father
money
that
counted
for
nothing
but
his
father
honour
his
father
good
name
and
even
if
he
were
not
bound
to
make
this
sacrifice
to
marry
maude
falconer
how
could
he
go
to
heron
hall
and
ask
godfrey
heron
the
man
of
ancient
lineage
of
unsullied
name
to
give
his
daughter
to
the
son
of
a
man
whose
past
was
so
black
that
his
character
was
at
the
mercy
of
ralph
falconer
stafford
rose
and
stretched
out
his
arms
as
if
to
thrust
from
him
a
weight
too
grievous
to
be
borne
a
cup
too
bitter
to
be
drained
then
his
arms
fell
to
his
sides
and
with
a
hardening
of
the
face
a
tightening
of
the
lips
which
made
him
look
strangely
like
his
father
he
left
the
library
and
crossing
the
hall
made
his
way
to
the
chapter
xxiii
the
ball
was
at
its
height
even
the
coldest
and
most
of
the
guests
had
warmed
up
and
caught
fire
at
the
blaze
of
excitement
and
enjoyment
the
was
dazzling
in
the
beauty
of
its
decorations
and
the
soft
effulgence
of
the
shaded
electric
light
in
which
the
magnificent
jewels
of
the
titled
and
wealthy
women
seemed
to
glow
with
a
subdued
and
chastened
fire
a
dance
was
in
progress
and
stafford
as
he
stood
by
the
doorway
and
looked
mechanically
and
dully
at
the
whirling
crowd
the
kaleidoscope
of
colour
formed
by
the
rich
dresses
the
fluttering
fans
and
the
dashes
of
black
represented
by
the
clothes
thought
vaguely
that
he
had
never
seen
anything
more
magnificent
more
elegant
of
wealth
and
success
but
through
it
all
weird
and
shone
ida
girlish
face
with
its
eyes
and
sweetly
curving
lips
he
looked
round
and
presently
he
saw
maude
falconer
in
her
strange
and
striking
dress
she
was
dancing
with
lord
fitzharford
there
was
not
a
touch
of
colour
in
her
face
her
lips
were
pensive
her
lids
lowered
she
looked
like
an
exquisite
statue
exquisitely
clothed
moving
with
the
exquisite
poetry
of
motion
but
quite
devoid
of
feeling
suddenly
as
if
she
felt
his
presence
she
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
a
light
shot
into
them
glowed
for
a
moment
her
lips
curved
with
the
faintest
of
smiles
and
a
warm
tint
stole
to
her
face
it
was
an
eloquent
look
one
that
could
not
be
mistaken
by
the
least
vain
of
men
and
it
went
straight
through
stafford
heart
for
it
forced
him
to
realise
that
which
he
had
not
even
yet
quite
realised
that
he
had
tacitly
pledged
himself
to
her
under
other
circumstances
the
thought
might
have
set
his
heart
beating
and
sent
the
blood
coursing
hotly
through
his
veins
but
with
his
heart
aching
with
love
for
ida
and
despair
at
the
loss
of
her
maude
only
chilled
him
and
made
him
shudder
with
apprehension
of
the
future
with
the
thought
of
the
cost
of
the
sacrifice
which
he
had
taken
upon
himself
the
music
sounded
like
a
funeral
march
in
his
ears
the
glitter
the
heat
the
movement
seemed
unendurable
and
he
threaded
his
way
round
the
room
to
an
which
had
been
fitted
up
as
a
buffet
give
me
some
wine
please
he
said
to
the
butler
trying
to
speak
in
his
ordinary
tone
but
he
knew
that
his
voice
was
harsh
and
strained
knew
that
the
butler
noticed
it
though
the
servant
did
not
move
an
eyelid
but
opened
a
bottle
of
champagne
with
solemn
alacrity
and
poured
out
a
glass
stafford
signed
to
him
to
place
the
bottle
near
and
drank
a
couple
of
glasses
it
pulled
him
together
a
bit
and
he
was
going
back
to
the
when
several
men
entered
they
were
griffenberg
baron
wirsch
the
beltons
and
the
other
financiers
they
were
all
talking
together
and
laughing
and
their
faces
were
flushed
with
triumph
close
behind
them
but
grave
and
taciturn
as
usual
came
falconer
at
sight
of
stafford
griffenberg
turned
from
the
man
to
whom
he
was
talking
and
exclaimed
gleefully
here
is
orme
you
have
herd
the
good
news
i
suppose
orme
splendid
is
it
wonderful
man
you
father

baron
the
baron
nodded
and
smiled
shir
stephen
ish
a
goot
man
of
pishness
you
have
a
very
glever
fader
mr
orme
he
said
emphatically
efford
caught
stafford
arm
as
he
was
passing
on
with
a
mechanical
smile
and
an
inclination
of
the
head
we
come
in
for
a
drink
orme
he
said
we
going
to
drink
luck
to
the
biggest
thing
sir
stephen
has
ever
done
you
join
us
oh
come
we
ca
take
a
refusal
dash
it
all
you
in
the
swim
orme
if
you
have
taken
any
active
part
in
it
stafford
glanced
at
falconer
and
noticed
a
grim
smile
pass
over
his
face
if
these
exultant
and
flushed
only
guessed
how
active
a
part
he
had
taken
how
amazed
they
would
be
a
wave
of
bitterness
swept
over
him
at
such
a
moment
men
especially
young
men
become
reckless
the
strain
is
too
great
and
they
fly
to
the
nearest
thing
for
relief
he
turned
back
to
the
buffet
and
the
butler
and
the
couple
of
footmen
opened
several
bottles
of
champagne
none
of
the
men
knew
or
cared
how
many
several
others
of
the
financial
group
joined
the
party
the
wine
went
round
rapidly
they
were
all
talking
and
laughing
except
stafford
who
remained
silent
and
grave
and
moody
for
some
little
time
then
he
too
began
to
talk
and
laugh
with
the
others
and
his
face
grew
flushed
and
his
manner
excited
falconer
who
stood
a
little
apart
apparently
drinking
with
the
others
but
really
with
care
and
moderation
watched
him
under
lids
and
presently
he
moved
round
to
where
stafford
leant
against
the
table
with
his
in
his
hand
and
touching
him
on
the
arm
said
i
hear
them
enquiring
for
you
in
the
stafford
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
called
stafford
by
his
christian
name
and
it
struck
home
as
falconer
had
intended
it
should
stafford
set
his
glass
down
and
looked
round
as
a
man
does
when
the
wine
is
creeping
up
to
his
head
and
he
is
startled
by
an
unexpected
voice
all
right
thanks
he
said
he
made
his
way
through
the
group
who
were
too
engrossed
and
excited
to
notice
his
desertion
and
went
into
the
as
he
did
so
his
father
entered
by
an
opposite
door
and
seeing
him
came
round
to
him
and
taking
stafford
hand
that
hung
at
his
side
pressed
it
significantly
i
have
told
them
he
said
they
are
almost
off
their
heads
with
delight
you
see
it
such
a
big
thing
even
for
them
staff
you
have
saved
us
all
my
boy
but
it
is
only
i
and
falconer
who
know
it
only
i
who
can
show
my
gratitude
his
voice
was
low
and
tremulous
his
face
flushed
like
those
of
the
men
whom
stafford
had
just
left
and
his
dark
eyes
flashing
and
restless
where
are
they
all
he
asked
and
stafford
nodded
over
his
shoulder
towards
the
buffet
sir
stephen
looked
round
the
room
with
a
smile
of
triumph
and
his
glance
rested
on
maude
falconer
standing
by
a
marble
column
her
eyes
downcast
her
fan
moving
to
and
fro
in
front
of
her
white
bosom
she
is
beautiful
staff
he
whispered
the
loveliest
woman
in
the
room
i
am
not
surprised
that
you
should
have
fallen
in
love
with
her
stafford
laughed
under
his
breath
a
strangely
wild
and
bitter
laugh
which
sir
stephen
could
not
have
failed
to
notice
if
the
music
had
not
commenced
a
new
waltz
at
that
moment
stafford
went
straight
across
the
room
to
maude
falconer
she
did
not
raise
her
eyes
at
his
approach
but
the
colour
flickered
in
her
cheeks
this
is
our
dance
i
think
he
said
she
looked
up
with
a
little
air
of
surprise
and
consulted
her
programme
no
i
think
this
is
mine
miss
falconer
said
the
man
at
her
side
no
she
said
calmly
the
next
is
yours
lord
bannerdale
this
is
mr
orme
though
he
knew
she
was
wrong
of
course
lord
bannerdale
acquiesced
with
a
bow
and
a
smile
and
stafford
led
maude
away
wine
has
a
trick
of
getting
into
some
men
feet
and
promptly
giving
them
away
but
stafford
though
he
was
usually
one
of
the
most
moderate
of
men
could
drink
a
fairly
large
quantity
and
remain
as
steady
as
a
rock
no
one
watching
him
dance
would
have
known
that
he
had
drunk
far
too
many
glasses
of
champagne
and
that
his
head
was
burning
his
heart
thumping
furiously
but
though
his
step
was
as
faultless
as
usual
and
he
steered
her
dexterously
through
this
crowd
maude
knew
by
his
silence
by
his
flushed
face
and
restless
eyes
that
something
had
happened
and
that
he
was
under
the
influence
of
some
deep
emotion
he
was
dancing
quite
perfectly
but
mechanically
like
a
man
in
a
dream
and
though
he
must
have
heard
the
music
he
did
not
hear
her
when
she
spoke
to
him
but
looked
straight
before
him
as
if
he
were
entirely
absorbed
in
some
thought
when
they
came
in
the
course
of
the
dance
to
one
of
the
doors
she
stopped
suddenly
do
you
mind
it
is
so
hot
she
murmured
n
o
he
said
as
if
awaking
suddenly
let
us
go
outside
he
caught
up
a
fur
cloak
that
was
lying
on
a
bench
and
disregarding
her
laughing
remonstrance
that
the
thing
did
not
belong
to
her
he
put
it
round
her
and
led
her
on
to
the
terrace
she
looked
up
at
him
just
as
they
were
passing
out
of
the
stream
of
light
saw
how
set
and
hard
his
face
was
how
straight
the
lips
and
sombre
the
eyes
and
her
hand
as
it
rested
lightly
on
his
arm
quivered
like
a
leaf
in
autumn
when
they
had
got
into
the
open
air
he
threw
back
his
head
and
drew
a
long
breath
yes
it
was
hot
in
there
he
said
they
walked
slowly
up
and
down
for
a
minute
passing
and
repassing
similar
couples
then
suddenly
as
if
the
presence
of
others
the
sound
of
their
voices
and
laughter
jarred
upon
him
stafford
said
shall
we
go
into
the
garden
it
is
quiet
there
and
i
want
to
speak
to
you
if
you
like
she
said
in
a
low
voice
which
she
tried
to
make
as
languid
as
usual
but
her
heart
began
to
beat
fiercely
and
her
lips
trembled
and
he
might
have
heard
her
breath
coming
quickly
had
he
not
been
absorbed
in
his
own
reflections
they
went
down
the
steps
and
into
the
of
the
beautiful
garden
the
silence
was
broken
by
the
hum
of
the
distant
voices
and
the
splashing
of
a
fountain
which
reflected
the
electric
light
as
the
spray
rose
and
fell
with
rhythmic
regularity
stafford
stopped
at
this
and
looked
at
the
reflection
of
the
stars
in
the
shallow
water
something
in
its
simplicitude
and
the
quiet
coming
after
the
glitter
and
the
noise
of
the
called
up
the
remembrance
of
herondale
and
the
quiet
hours
he
had
spent
there
with
ida
the
thought
went
through
him
with
a
sharp
pain
and
he
thrust
it
away
from
him
as
one
thrusts
away
a
threatening
weakness
what
is
it
you
wanted
to
say
to
me
asked
maude
not
coldly
or
indifferently
as
she
would
have
asked
the
question
of
another
man
but
softly
dreamily
he
walked
on
with
her
a
few
paces
looking
straight
before
him
as
if
he
were
trying
to
find
words
suitable
for
the
answer
then
he
turned
his
face
to
her
and
looked
at
her
steadily
though
his
head
was
burning
and
the
plash
of
the
fountain
sounded
like
the
roar
of
the
sea
in
his
ears
i
wonder
whether
you
could
guess
he
said
as
he
thought
of
her
father
words
his
assertion
that
stafford
was
to
be
his
i
suppose
you
must
her
gaze
was
as
steady
as
his
but
her
lips
quivered
slightly
i
would
rather
you
should
tell
me
than
that
i
should
i
guess
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
might
be
wrong
he
was
not
in
a
condition
to
notice
the
significance
of
her
last
words
and
he
went
on
with
a
kind
of
desperation
i
brought
you
here
into
the
garden
miss
falconer
to
ask
you
if
be
my
wife
they
had
stopped
just
within
the
radius
of
an
electric
light
held
aloft
by
a
grinning
satyr
and
stafford
saw
her
face
grow
paler
and
paler
in
the
seconds
that
followed
the
momentous
question
he
could
see
her
bosom
heaving
under
the
fur
cloak
felt
her
hand
close
for
an
instant
on
his
arm
do
you
wish
me
to
say
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
the
red
flooded
stafford
face
for
a
moment
and
his
eyes
fell
under
her
fixed
regard
what
answer
does
one
generally
hope
for
when
one
puts
such
a
question
he
said
trying
to
smile
i
want
you
to
be
my
wife
and
i
hope
with
all
my
heart
that
you
will
say
all
your
heart
she
echoed
slowly
almost
inaudibly
all
your
heart
with
all
mine
i
answer
as
she
murmured
the
words
and
like
that
of
most
cold
women
when
they
are
intensely
moved
her
voice
could
be
exquisitely
sweet
with
its
thrill
of
passion
all
the
sweeter
for
its
rarity
she
insensibly
drew
nearer
to
him
and
her
hand
stole
to
his
shoulder
her
eyes
were
lifted
to
his
and
they
shone
with
the
love
that
was
coursing
through
her
veins
almost
stopping
the
beating
of
her
heart
love
radiated
from
her
as
the
light
radiated
from
the
lamp
the
mocking
satyr
held
above
them
stafford
was
at
his
best
and
worst
a
man
and
not
a
block
of
stone
and
wood
and
touched
almost
fired
by
the
passion
so
close
to
him
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
bent
his
head
until
his
lips
nearly
touched
hers
her
eyes
closed
and
she
was
surrendering
herself
to
the
kiss
when
suddenly
she
drew
her
head
back
and
keeping
him
from
her
looked
up
at
him
is
it
with
all
your
heart
she
whispered
you
have
never
spoken
to
me
of
love
before
is
it
with
all
your
heart
his
brow
contracted
in
a
frown
he
set
his
teeth
hard
if
he
were
to
lie
better
that
he
lied
thoroughly
and
well
better
that
his
sacrifice
should
be
complete
and
effectual
scarcely
knowing
what
he
said
what
he
did
with
the
fumes
of
the
champagne
confusing
his
brain
the
misery
of
his
lost
love
racking
his
heart
he
said
hoarsely
i
did
not
know
till
you
can
trust
me
i
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
i
will
be
true
to
you
it
is
with
all
my
heart
if
jove
laughs
at
lovers
perjuries
the
angels
must
weep
at
such
false
oaths
as
this
even
as
he
spoke
the
words
stafford
remembered
the
i
love
you
he
had
cried
to
ida
as
he
knelt
at
her
feet
and
he
shuddered
as
maude
drew
his
head
down
and
his
lips
met
hers
half
an
hour
later
they
went
slowly
up
the
steps
again
stafford
head
was
still
burning
he
still
felt
confused
like
a
man
moving
in
a
dream
since
he
had
kissed
her
he
had
said
very
little
and
the
silences
had
been
broken
more
often
by
maude
than
by
him
she
had
told
him
in
a
low
voice
tremulous
with
love
and
hesitating
now
and
again
how
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
the
day
he
had
rowed
her
on
the
lake
how
she
had
struggled
and
striven
against
the
feeling
and
how
it
had
conquered
her
how
miserable
she
had
been
though
she
had
tried
to
hide
her
misery
lest
he
should
never
come
to
care
for
her
and
she
should
have
to
suffer
that
most
merciless
of
all
miseries
unrequited
love
she
seemed
as
if
she
scarcely
wanted
him
to
speak
as
if
she
took
it
for
granted
that
he
had
spoken
the
truth
and
that
he
loved
her
and
as
if
it
were
a
joy
to
her
to
bare
her
heart
that
he
might
see
how
devotedly
it
throbbed
for
him
and
for
him
alone
every
now
and
then
stafford
spoke
a
few
words
in
response
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
said
he
could
not
have
told
what
they
were
ten
minutes
after
they
were
said
he
sat
with
his
arm
round
her
like
a
man
playing
a
part
mechanically
in
the
same
condition
he
moved
beside
her
now
as
arm
and
arm
they
entered
the
house
he
looking
straight
before
him
with
a
set
face
a
forced
smile
she
with
now
raised
now
drooping
eyes
glowing
with
triumph
a
flush
on
her
usually
pale
face
her
lips
apart
and
tremulous
the
ball
was
breaking
up
some
of
the
women
had
already
gone
to
the
or
their
own
apartments
a
stream
of
men
were
making
their
way
to
the
from
which
came
the
popping
of
and
the
hissing
of
syphons
as
they
entered
the
hall
howard
came
lounging
out
in
his
leisurely
way
from
the
and
at
sight
of
him
stafford
seemed
to
awake
to
realise
what
he
had
done
and
how
he
stood
he
looked
from
howard
to
maude
then
he
said
howard
i
want
you
to
congratulate
me
miss
falconer
maude
has
promised
to
be
my
wife
howard
did
not
start
but
he
stared
in
silence
for
an
instant
then
his
eyelids
flickered
and
forcing
the
astonishment
from
his
face
he
took
stafford
left
hand
and
shook
it
and
bowed
to
maude
i
do
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
my
dear
stafford
and
i
hope
you
both
be
as
happy
as
the
happiest
pair
in
a
fairy
story
she
drew
her
arm
from
stafford
i
will
go
up
now
she
said
stafford
stood
until
she
had
got
as
far
as
the
bend
of
the
stairs
then
howard
who
had
discreetly
gone
on
turned
to
go
back
to
him
but
as
he
came
up
with
a
word
of
wonder
and
repeated
congratulations
he
saw
stafford
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
as
it
seemed
to
howard
almost
stagger
there
are
moments
when
the
part
of
even
one
best
friend
is
silence
blindness
howard
turned
aside
and
stafford
went
on
slowly
with
a
kind
of
enforced
steadiness
to
the
while
howard
with
dismay
and
apprehension
was
looking
after
him
he
heard
mr
howard
called
softly
mockingly
from
the
stairs
and
looking
up
saw
maude
falconer
leaning
over
with
her
arm
extended
her
hand
open
he
understood
in
a
moment
and
removing
his
ring
as
he
ran
up
the
stairs
put
it
in
the
soft
pink
palm
she
gave
a
little
triumphant
mocking
laugh
her
hand
closed
over
the
ring
and
then
she
glided
away
from
him
the
was
crowded
as
stafford
made
his
way
in
through
the
clouds
of
smoke
he
saw
his
father
standing
at
one
end
surrounded
by
the
crew
falconer
seated
in
a
chair
near
him
with
a
black
cigar
between
his
lips
the
group
were
laughing
and
talking
loudly
and
all
had
glasses
in
their
hands
some
of
the
younger
men
who
had
just
come
from
the
were
adding
their
laughter
and
chatter
to
the
noise
dazed
and
confused
half
mad
with
rage
and
despair
with
a
sense
that
fate
was
joining
her
mocking
laughter
with
that
of
the
men
round
him
stafford
took
a
glass
of
wine
from
the
butler
who
advanced
with
it
and
drinking
it
off
held
it
out
to
be
refilled
the
man
refilled
it
twice
and
stafford
his
eyes
aflame
almost
pushed
his
way
through
the
various
groups
to
where
his
father
stood
i
have
come
for
your
congratulation
sir
he
said
in
a
voice
which
though
not
loud
was
so
clear
as
to
break
through
the
row
miss
falconer
has
promised
to
be
my
wife
a
silence
so
sudden
as
to
be
startling
fell
upon
the
hot
and
crowded
room
then
as
sir
stephen
grasped
his
son
hand
a
din
of
voices
arose
an
excited
buzz
of
congratulations
and
good
wishes
stafford
faced
them
all
his
face
pale
and
set
his
lips
curved
with
a
forced
smile
his
eyes
flashing
but
lit
with
a
sombre
fire
there
was
a
smile
on
his
lips
a
false
amiability
in
his
eyes
but
there
was
so
much
of
madness
in
his
heart
that
he
was
afraid
lest
at
any
moment
he
should
dash
the
glass
to
the
ground
and
break
out
into
cursing
an
hour
later
he
found
himself
in
his
room
and
waving
measom
away
from
him
he
went
to
the
window
and
flung
it
wide
open
and
stood
there
with
his
hands
against
his
throbbing
brow
and
though
no
word
came
from
his
parched
lips
his
heart
cried
ida
ida
with
all
the
agony
of
despair
chapter
xxiv
the
hours
dragged
along
as
stafford
faced
the
tragedy
of
his
life
as
he
paced
the
room
or
flung
himself
into
a
chair
with
his
head
bowed
in
his
hands
the
effects
of
the
wine
he
had
taken
the
suppressed
excitement
under
which
he
had
laboured
passed
away
and
in
the
reaction
his
brain
cleared
and
he
began
to
realise
the
terrible
import
of
the
step
he
had
taken
the
extent
of
the
sacrifice
he
had
made
his
own
life
was
wrecked
and
ruined
irreparably
not
only
his
own
but
that
of
the
girl
he
loved
the
step
he
had
taken
was
not
only
irreparable
but
irrevocable
he
could
not
go
back
he
had
asked
maude
falconer
to
be
his
wife
he
had
spoken
words
which
must
have
sounded
to
her
as
words
of
love
he
had
kissed
her
lips
in
a
word
he
was
pledged
to
her
and
the
pledge
could
not
be
broken
and
ida
what
should
he
do
in
regard
to
her
he
had
promised
that
if
his
feelings
underwent
any
change
towards
her
he
would
not
go
and
tell
her
and
at
that
moment
he
felt
that
the
promise
had
not
been
a
vain
one
for
he
knew
that
he
could
not
go
to
her
that
at
sight
of
her
his
resolution
would
melt
like
snow
in
the
sun
that
his
love
for
her
would
sweep
him
away
on
a
torrent
of
passion
and
that
he
would
be
as
false
to
maude
falconer
as
he
had
been
to
ida
and
yet
he
could
not
leave
her
desert
her
yes
that
was
the
word
without
making
some
sign
without
speaking
one
word
not
of
excuse
but
of
farewell
what
could
he
say
to
her
he
could
not
tell
her
the
truth
for
his
father
sake
that
must
never
be
divulged
he
could
give
her
no
explanation
must
permit
her
to
think
him
base
and
faithless
and
dishonorable
there
was
only
one
thing
he
could
do
and
that
was
to
write
to
her
but
what
could
he
say
he
went
to
his
and
took
up
a
pen
his
hand
was
cold
as
ice
and
shaking
and
he
held
it
before
him
until
it
grew
steadier
at
the
best
of
times
stafford
was
not
much
of
a
one
does
not
learn
the
epistolatory
art
either
at
public
schools
or
the
and
hitherto
stafford
had
been
confined
to
the
sending
or
accepting
of
invitations
a
short
note
about
some
meet
or
horse
dealing
how
was
he
to
address
her
she
was
his
dearest
still
the
only
woman
in
the
world
he
had
loved
or
ever
would
love
but
he
dared
not
call
her
so
dared
not
tell
her
so
he
wrote
her
name
but
the
sweet
word
seemed
to
look
up
at
him
reproachfully
accusingly
and
though
he
had
written
only
that
name
he
tore
up
several
sheets
of
paper
and
at
last
in
desperation
scarcely
knowing
what
he
was
writing
he
wrote
quickly
hurriedly
and
without
pausing
the
following
lines
i
am
writing
this
because
you
made
me
promise
that
if
anything
happened
let
it
be
what
it
might
to
separate
us
i
would
not
come
and
tell
you
something
has
happened
i
have
discovered
that
i
am
not
only
unworthy
of
calling
you
mine
as
any
man
in
the
world
even
the
best
would
be
but
that
i
am
unworthy
in
the
sense
that
would
justify
you
in
the
eyes
of
your
father
of
everybody
belonging
to
you
in
sending
me
adrift
if
i
could
tell
you
what
it
is
you
would
understand
and
see
how
great
a
gulf
yawns
between
us
you
would
not
marry
me
i
can
never
be
anything
to
you
but
a
painful
memory
though
you
know
how
much
i
loved
you
you
will
never
guess
what
it
costs
me
to
relinquish
all
claim
to
you
to
tear
myself
away
from
you
but
i
must
do
so
and
forever
there
is
no
hope
none
whatever
for
me
i
do
not
ask
you
to
forgive
me
if
i
had
known
what
i
know
now
i
would
rather
have
died
than
have
told
you
that
i
loved
you
but
i
do
ask
you
to
forget
me
or
if
you
remember
me
to
think
of
me
as
the
most
wretched
and
of
men
as
one
who
is
bound
hand
and
foot
and
compelled
driven
along
a
path
against
his
will
i
dare
not
say
any
more
dare
not
tell
you
what
this
sacrifice
costs
me
whether
you
forget
or
remember
me
i
shall
never
forget
you
for
a
single
instant
shall
never
cease
to
look
back
upon
my
lost
happiness
as
a
man
looks
back
upon
a
lost
heaven
stafford
he
read
it
over
a
dozen
twenty
times
and
every
time
it
seemed
weaker
meaner
less
inexplicable
but
he
knew
that
if
he
destroyed
it
he
could
write
nothing
better
nothing
that
could
satisfy
him
though
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
heart
would
have
expressed
itself
more
fully
it
he
had
written
only
forget
me
at
last
and
reluctantly
he
put
it
in
an
envelope
and
addressed
it
and
turned
it
face
downwards
on
his
table
so
that
he
might
not
see
the
name
which
had
such
power
to
torture
his
heart
by
the
time
he
had
succeeded
in
writing
the
letter
the
dawn
was
creeping
over
the
hills
and
casting
a
pearly
light
upon
the
lake
he
drew
the
curtains
and
in
the
weird
light
caught
sight
of
his
face
in
the
mirror
a
white
and
haggard
face
which
might
well
have
belonged
to
a
man
ten
years
his
senior
such
a
face
as
would
not
fail
to
attract
attention
and
provoke
comment
by
its
appearance
at
the
he
flung
himself
on
the
bed
not
to
sleep
for
he
knew
that
that
would
be
impossible
but
to
get
some
rest
but
rest
was
as
impossible
as
sleep
when
he
closed
his
eyes
ida
face
was
near
him
her
voice
was
in
his
ears
inextricably
mixed
with
the
slow
and
languorous
tones
of
maude
falconer
he
undressed
and
got
into
his
flannels
before
measom
came
and
went
down
to
the
lake
for
a
bath
he
was
as
a
rule
so
moderate
in
drinking
that
the
wine
he
had
taken
supplemented
by
his
misery
made
him
feel
physically
ill
he
shuddered
with
cold
as
he
dived
into
the
water
and
as
he
swam
out
he
felt
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
a
slight
twinge
of
cramp
at
another
time
he
would
have
been
somewhat
alarmed
for
the
strongest
swimmer
is
absolutely
helpless
under
an
attack
of
cramp
but
this
morning
he
was
indifferent
and
the
thought
struck
him
that
it
would
be
well
for
him
if
he
flung
up
his
arms
and
went
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
lake
on
the
shores
of
which
he
had
experienced
such
exquisite
joy
such
unutterable
misery
he
met
no
one
on
his
way
back
to
the
house
and
went
straight
to
his
room
the
swim
had
removed
some
of
the
traces
of
last
work
but
he
still
looked
haggard
and
worn
and
there
was
that
expression
in
his
eyes
which
a
man
wear
when
he
has
been
battling
with
a
great
grief
or
struggling
against
an
overwhelming
fate
as
measom
was
dressing
him
he
asked
himself
how
he
should
get
the
letter
to
ida
the
only
letter
he
had
ever
written
her
the
only
letter
he
would
probably
ever
write
to
her
he
decided
that
he
would
send
it
over
by
pottinger
whom
he
knew
he
could
trust
not
only
to
deliver
the
letter
but
to
refrain
from
telling
anyone
that
he
had
been
sent
with
it
he
put
it
in
the
pocket
of
his
and
went
downstairs
intending
to
go
straight
to
the
stables
to
find
pottinger
but
as
he
went
through
the
hall
murray
the
secretary
came
out
of
the
library
and
sir
stephen
caught
sight
of
stafford
through
the
open
door
and
called
to
him
stafford
went
in
and
his
father
rose
from
the
table
on
which
was
already
piled
a
heap
of
letters
and
papers
and
taking
stafford
hand
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
you
are
early
my
boy
he
said
i
did
not
expect
to
see
you
for
hours
yet
could
you
sleep
you
look
rather
tired
stafford
you
were
late
last
night
and
ah
well
there
was
some
excuse
for
a
little
excitement
and
exaltation
he
smiled
whimsically
as
a
father
does
at
a
son
who
has
for
once
gone
beyond
the
strict
bounds
of
moderation
and
looked
upon
the
wine
cup
too
often
yes
i
rather
a
head
on
this
morning
sir
said
stafford
quietly
accepting
the
suggestion
as
an
excuse
for
his
i
drank
and
smoked
last
night
more
than
i
usually
do
you
look
as
fresh
as
usual
sir
he
added
with
unconscious
irony
sir
stephen
threw
up
his
head
with
a
short
laugh
oh
my
work
was
finished
last
night
my
dear
boy
he
said
and
murray
and
i
have
been
at
it
since
seven
i
want
to
put
some
of
these
papers
straight
before
griffenberg
and
the
rest
leave
they
are
going
said
stafford
oh
yes
there
will
be
a
general
exodus
a
great
many
of
the
people
were
only
staying
on
until
we
could
be
sure
we
had
pulled
this
railway
scheme
through
falconer
and
his
daughter
i
beg
your
pardon
my
dear
stafford
i
mean
maude
talk
of
going
but
i
persuaded
them
to
stay
until
i
thought
you
would
like
to
go
to
london
with
them
he
smiled
as
a
father
smiles
when
he
is
planning
a
pleasure
for
his
son
yes
i
should
like
it
said
stafford
quietly
but
could
i
leave
you
here
oh
yes
said
sir
stephen
they
entertain
themselves
besides
it
was
an
understood
thing
you
should
be
free
to
go
and
come
as
you
pleased
of
course
you
would
like
to
go
with
maude
of
course
echoed
stafford
his
eyes
on
the
ground
as
he
was
leaving
the
room
his
father
took
a
letter
from
the
table
held
it
up
and
dropped
it
you
be
wanting
to
buy
a
little
present
for
your
stafford
he
said
i
am
placing
a
thousand
pounds
to
your
credit
at
your
bank
i
do
know
whether
you
think
that
is
enough
quite
enough
said
stafford
in
a
low
voice
thank
you
you
are
very
generous
sir
stephen
winced
and
held
up
his
hand
what
is
mine
is
yours
from
this
moment
my
dear
stafford
he
said
stafford
went
out
by
the
door
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
and
made
his
way
to
the
stables
just
as
he
was
crossing
the
lawn
the
temptation
to
ride
over
to
heron
hall
and
leave
the
note
himself
assailed
him
strongly
he
took
the
letter
from
his
pocket
and
looked
at
it
wistfully
but
he
knew
that
he
dared
not
ran
the
risk
of
meeting
ida
and
with
a
sigh
he
went
on
towards
the
stables
carrying
the
note
in
his
hand
and
as
he
turned
away
maude
falconer
let
fall
the
curtain
which
she
had
raised
at
her
window
so
that
she
might
watch
him
she
stood
for
a
moment
with
her
costly
held
together
with
one
white
hand
her
lids
half
closed
he
has
written
to
her
she
said
to
herself
has
he
broken
with
her
for
good
or
will
he
try
and
keep
her
i
would
give
something
to
see
that
letter
to
know
exactly
how
he
stands
and
how
i
stand
i
wonder
how
he
will
send
it
he
is
taking
it
to
the
stables
she
thought
a
moment
then
she
smiled
pottinger
she
murmured
stafford
found
pottinger
giving
the
last
loving
touches
with
a
silk
handkerchief
to
adonis
his
coat
and
waistcoat
were
off
his
shirt
open
at
the
neck
and
his
sleeves
turned
up
he
touched
his
forehead
with
a
respectful
and
welcoming
greeting
and
without
any
surprise
for
stafford
very
often
paid
an
early
visit
to
the
stable
and
had
more
than
once
lent
a
hand
in
grooming
a
favourite
horse
looks
well
sir
do
he
said
pottinger
passing
a
hand
over
the
glossy
black
and
finishing
up
with
a
loving
smack
i
rather
late
this
morning
sir
he
smiled
and
looked
a
little
sheepish
we
had
a
little
bit
of
jollification
in
the
servants
hall
on
our
own
account
sir
and
were
enjoying
ourselves
like
our
betters
that
right
said
stafford
something
in
his
voice
caused
pottinger
to
glance
at
him
with
surprise
and
apprehension
but
of
course
he
could
not
say
anything
and
he
dropped
his
eyes
respectfully
after
the
one
glance
at
stafford
haggard
face
i
want
you
take
a
letter
for
me
this
morning
pottinger
said
stafford
you
can
take
adonis
it
will
exercise
him
as
i
shall
not
ride
him
here
is
the
letter
heron
hall
lies
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
i
want
the
letter
taken
there
early
this
morning
pottinger
touched
his
forehead
i
know
the
hall
sir
i
ridden
over
there
with
messages
from
the
housekeeper
and
from
mr
davis
there
will
be
no
answer
said
stafford
simply
leave
it
yes
sir
said
pottinger
would
you
mind
putting
it
in
my
sir
i
wo
touch
it
till
my
hands
are
clean
stafford
put
the
letter
in
the
wallet
said
a
few
words
to
adonis
and
some
of
the
other
horses
and
then
left
the
stable
he
heard
voices
on
the
terrace
and
to
avoid
meeting
anyone
until
he
was
compelled
he
went
down
the
slope
of
the
lawn
and
seating
himself
on
a
bank
lit
a
cigarette
from
her
window
maude
falconer
now
attired
in
a
simple
but
exquisitely
effective
morning
frock
could
see
him
after
watching
him
for
a
minute
or
two
she
went
to
her
and
wrote
two
or
three
notes
quickly
and
with
these
in
her
pocket
went
and
through
the
hall
to
the
stable
pottinger
was
still
finishing
off
adonis
and
he
drew
himself
up
and
saluted
as
she
entered
the
stables
as
a
rule
her
manner
to
the
servants
and
her
inferiors
was
cold
and
haughty
but
as
stafford
had
discovered
last
night
she
could
be
soft
and
gentle
when
she
chose
and
she
smiled
now
at
pottinger
and
the
horse
in
a
fashion
that
almost
dazzled
that
ingenuous
youth
at
the
same
time
her
eye
had
noted
pottinger
coat
and
waistcoat
which
hung
on
a
hook
at
the
with
the
slung
over
them
the
coat
was
an
old
one
with
gaping
pockets
and
there
was
no
sign
of
a
letter
in
them
or
in
the
waistcoat
instinctively
she
knew
that
it
was
in
the
wallet
what
splendid
condition
that
horse
is
in
pottinger
she
said
his
coat
is
like
satin
i
suppose
you
were
in
the
army
of
course
pottinger
was
flattered
and
answered
in
the
negative
very
reluctantly
not
but
what
stafford
miss
is
as
particular
as
any
army
gent
could
be
i
should
be
sorry
to
turn
out
a
badly
groomed
for
stafford
eyes
to
rest
on
miss
he
as
a
master
as
a
man
could
desire
to
have
but
that
about
the
one
thing
stafford
would
stand
miss
i
suppose
not
she
said
are
you
going
to
ride
into
bryndermere
this
morning
pottinger
if
so
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
take
these
notes
to
the
linen
draper
and
the
chemist
and
bring
me
back
the
things
i
have
written
for
certainly
miss
said
pottinger
then
he
remembered
stafford
order
and
looked
anything
but
certain
would
it
do
late
in
the
morning
miss
i
have
to
go
somewhere
first
oh
yes
she
replied
where
shall
i
put
the
letters
in
this
wallet
pottinger
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
thanked
her
and
she
unfastened
the
wallet
talking
to
him
as
she
did
so
is
that
a
swelling
on
that
near
fore
leg
pottinger
she
said
suddenly
pointing
to
adonis
pottinger
started
and
regarded
her
with
a
look
of
horror
and
of
course
instantly
knelt
down
to
examine
the
suspected
member
long
before
he
had
come
up
again
with
a
breath
of
relief
and
a
smiling
no
miss
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
it
she
had
looked
into
the
wallet
and
seen
stafford
letter
oh
i
thought
there
was
she
said
have
you
finished
your
horses
no
miss
he
replied
i
have
the
master
hunter
and
the
mare
you
ride
to
do
yet
she
nodded
and
went
out
of
the
stable
humming
one
of
her
songs
but
she
did
not
go
very
far
in
five
minutes
she
back
again
oh
pottinger
do
trouble
about
those
letters
i
will
ride
into
bryndermere
myself
pottinger
was
in
the
mare
stall
and
maude
stopped
him
as
he
was
coming
forward
by
saying
do
trouble
i
take
the
letters
from
the
wallet
with
stafford
letter
amongst
her
own
in
her
pocket
she
went
quickly
and
yet
without
apparent
hurry
to
her
own
room
sent
away
her
maid
on
an
errand
and
slipped
the
bolt
in
the
door
rapidly
she
lit
her
silver
and
heated
the
water
almost
to
and
held
the
envelope
of
stafford
letter
over
it
until
the
gum
was
melted
and
the
flap
came
open
then
she
took
out
the
letter
and
throwing
herself
back
in
an
read
it
slowly
at
first
as
she
read
her
face
burned
then
it
grew
pale
and
still
paler
every
word
of
the
bitter
farewell
of
the
renunciation
written
as
if
with
a
man
heart
blood
stabbed
her
and
tortured
her
with
the
pangs
of
jealousy
once
she
started
to
her
feet
her
hands
clenched
her
head
thrown
back
her
eyes
flashing
a
superb
figure
the
tigress
aroused
at
that
instant
she
was
minded
to
take
the
letter
and
fling
it
in
stafford
face
and
with
it
fling
back
the
pledge
which
he
had
given
her
the
night
before
then
she
collapsed
as
it
were
and
sank
into
a
chair
dropping
the
letter
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
she
could
not
the
strength
of
her
love
made
her
weak
as
water
where
that
love
was
concerned
though
her
pride
called
upon
her
to
surrender
stafford
she
could
not
respond
to
it
swaying
to
and
fro
with
her
eyes
covered
as
if
to
hide
her
shame
she
tried
to
tell
herself
that
stafford
was
only
a
transient
fancy
for
this
girl
that
it
was
mere
flirtation
a
vulgar
that
she
would
teach
him
to
forget
he
shall
he
shall
she
cried
behind
her
hands
as
if
the
words
were
wrung
from
her
in
her
anguish
of
wounded
pride
and
rejected
love
i
will
teach
him
there
is
no
art
that
woman
ever
used
that
i
will
not
use
they
say
i
am
beautiful
if
i
am
my
beauty
shall
minister
to
him
as
no
woman
beauty
has
ever
ministered
before
cold
to
all
the
rest
of
the
world
i
will
be
to
him
a
fire
which
shall
warm
his
life
and
make
it
a
heaven
it
is
only
because
he
saw
her
first
if
he
had
seen
me
oh
curse
her
curse
her
last
night
while
he
was
talking
to
me
even
while
he
was
kissing
me
he
was
thinking
of
her
but
she
shall
not
have
him
she
has
lost
and
i
have
won
and
i
will
keep
him
she
dashed
her
hand
across
her
eyes
though
there
were
no
tears
in
them
and
stood
upright
holding
herself
tensely
as
if
she
were
battling
for
calm
then
she
replaced
the
poignant
note
in
its
envelope
and
went
back
to
the
stables
again
she
met
no
one
for
those
who
were
down
were
in
at
breakfast
i
have
changed
my
mind
pottinger
she
said
and
will
be
glad
if
you
will
take
the
notes
please
see
i
have
put
them
back
in
the
wallet
certainly
miss
said
pottinger
and
he
touched
his
forehead
two
or
three
times
and
coloured
and
smiled
awkwardly
and
looked
at
her
with
a
new
and
vivid
interest
one
of
the
maids
had
run
into
the
stable
during
maud
absence
and
had
told
him
the
news
that
his
master
was
engaged
to
miss
maude
falconer
for
the
servants
who
are
so
quick
to
discover
all
our
little
secrets
had
already
learnt
this
one
and
the
servants
hall
was
buzzing
with
it
chapter
xxv
that
morning
ida
came
singing
not
loudly
but
in
the
soft
undertone
which
a
girl
uses
when
she
is
supremely
happy
and
she
has
hopes
of
seeing
the
cause
of
her
happiness
very
soon
all
through
breakfast
while
heron
read
his
letters
opening
them
and
reading
them
stealthily
as
usual
her
heart
was
singing
its
to
her
and
she
was
wondering
whether
she
would
meet
stafford
by
the
stream
or
among
the
hills
that
she
should
meet
him
she
felt
quite
sure
for
he
had
never
failed
to
leave
the
gay
party
at
the
villa
to
come
over
to
her
every
day
perhaps
he
had
spoken
to
his
father
and
in
the
wonderful
way
men
have
had
swept
aside
all
the
obstacles
which
stood
against
their
union
he
was
so
strong
so
so
masterful
though
so
gentle
with
her
that
surely
no
obstacles
could
stand
against
him
she
was
so
absorbed
in
her
thoughts
that
she
almost
started
when
jason
appeared
and
looking
from
her
to
heron
announced
that
wordley
the
family
lawyer
was
in
the
library
heron
flushed
and
scrambled
his
letters
and
papers
together
as
he
rose
wo
wordley
come
in
and
have
some
breakfast
suggested
ida
but
her
father
shaking
his
head
impatiently
said
that
wordley
was
sure
to
have
had
his
breakfast
and
shuffled
out
of
the
room
a
few
minutes
after
he
had
gone
jessie
came
in
for
the
day
orders
and
ida
dragged
her
thoughts
away
from
the
subject
and
plunged
into
housekeeping
it
was
not
a
lengthy
or
a
very
elaborate
business
alas
but
when
it
was
over
jessie
lingered
and
began
collecting
the
breakfast
things
glancing
shyly
at
ida
as
she
always
did
when
she
wanted
to
gossip
there
was
fine
doings
up
at
the
villa
last
night
miss
ida
she
began
rather
timidly
for
ida
seldom
encouraged
her
chatter
there
was
a
ball
there
such
a
tremendous
grand
affair
there
has
been
anything
like
it
ever
known
in
this
country
williams
was
up
there
this
morning
and
susie
told
him
that
it
was
like
fairyland
what
with
the
beautiful
rooms
and
the
music
and
the
ladies
rich
dresses
and
jewels
she
got
a
peep
through
one
of
the
open
doors
and
she
says
it
quite
took
her
breath
away
ida
smiled
she
was
not
envious
for
would
not
stafford
come
over
presently
and
tell
her
all
about
it
who
was
there
with
whom
he
had
danced
and
how
all
the
time
he
had
been
longing
to
be
by
her
side
susie
says
that
the
ladies
was
beautiful
miss
ida
and
that
the
most
beautiful
of
them
all
was
miss
falconer
susie
says
she
had
the
most
lovely
dress
like
a
cloud
of
smoke
with
diamonds
sparkling
all
over
it
like
stars
that
sounds
very
pretty
and
poetical
jessie
said
ida
what
would
he
care
for
a
dress
like
a
cloud
or
the
diamonds
that
shone
like
stars
on
it
did
she
not
know
that
he
loved
the
little
habit
which
a
certain
rustic
country
girl
wore
better
than
the
choicest
production
of
worth
yes
miss
jessie
went
on
and
susie
says
that
stafford
the
lord
son
the
simple
dale
folk
as
often
called
sir
stephen
my
lord
as
sir
danced
ever
so
many
times
with
her
and
the
servants
was
saying
that
he
was
making
love
to
her
and
that
they
should
be
surprised
to
hear
that
stafford
was
going
to
marry
miss
falconer
ida
could
not
prevent
the
colour
rising
to
her
face
but
she
laughed
unforcedly
and
with
no
misgiving
for
she
had
looked
into
eyes
and
read
his
soul
through
them
he
was
hers
let
all
the
women
in
the
world
be
beautiful
and
decked
in
silks
and
satins
she
ran
upstairs
to
put
on
her
habit
leaving
jessie
rather
disappointed
at
the
effect
of
her
news
and
she
sang
while
she
tied
the
little
scarlet
sailor
knot
and
presently
came
down
the
stairs
with
a
step
as
light
as
her
heart
as
she
was
mounting
and
talking
to
jason
about
the
last
lot
of
steers
wordley
came
out
of
the
house
to
get
his
horse
and
hurried
to
her
in
the
good
old
way
no
i
ca
stay
he
said
in
answer
to
her
invitation
i
have
to
be
back
at
the
office
but
i
ride
a
little
way
with
you
if
i
may
it
is
often
i
get
the
chance
of
riding
with
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
county
there
now
i
made
you
blush
as
i
used
to
when
you
sat
upon
my
knee
and
i
told
you
that
little
girls
had
no
right
to
stars
for
eyes
ida
laughed
but
i
a
big
girl
now
she
said
and
too
old
for
compliments
besides
lawyers
should
always
speak
the
truth
for
goodness
sake
do
spread
that
theory
my
dear
or
we
shall
all
have
to
put
our
shutters
up
he
retorted
with
mock
alarm
he
got
on
his
old
rather
stiffly
and
they
rode
out
of
the
and
on
to
the
road
where
be
sure
ida
eyes
swept
the
hills
and
the
valleys
lest
perchance
a
young
man
should
be
riding
there
they
rode
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
during
which
the
old
lawyer
seemed
very
thoughtful
and
glanced
at
her
sideways
as
if
he
were
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
about
something
at
last
he
said
with
an
affectation
of
casualness
father
been
pretty
well
of
late
my
dear
ida
hesitated
for
a
moment
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
tell
even
wordley
of
her
father
painful
habit
of
walking
in
his
sleep
yes
she
said
fairly
well
sometimes
he
is
rather
restless
and
irritable
as
if
he
were
worried
has
he
anything
to
worry
him
wordley
i
mean
anything
more
than
usual
he
did
not
answer
and
she
looked
at
him
as
if
waiting
for
his
reply
i
was
thinking
of
what
you
just
said
that
you
were
a
big
girl
so
you
are
though
you
always
seem
to
me
like
the
little
child
i
used
to
nurse
but
the
world
rolls
on
and
you
have
grown
into
a
woman
and
i
ought
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
said
at
last
the
truth
she
echoed
with
a
quick
glance
yes
he
said
nodding
gravely
does
your
father
ever
talk
to
you
of
business
my
dear
i
know
that
you
manage
the
house
and
the
farm
ay
and
manage
them
well
but
i
do
know
whether
he
ever
tells
you
anything
about
the
business
of
the
estate
i
ask
because
i
am
in
rather
an
awkward
position
when
your
father
dismissed
his
steward
i
thought
he
would
consult
me
on
the
matters
which
the
steward
used
to
manage
but
he
has
not
done
so
and
i
am
really
more
ignorant
about
his
affairs
than
anyone
would
credit
seeing
that
i
have
been
the
herons
family
lawyer
i
and
mine
since
well
say
since
the
flood
no
my
father
tells
me
nothing
said
ida
is
there
anything
the
matter
is
there
anything
i
should
know
he
looked
at
her
gravely
compassionately
my
dear
i
think
there
is
he
said
if
you
had
a
brother
or
any
relative
near
you
i
would
not
worry
you
would
not
tell
you
but
you
have
none
you
are
quite
alone
you
see
quite
alone
she
echoed
and
then
she
blushed
as
she
remembered
stafford
and
that
she
was
no
longer
alone
in
the
world
and
so
i
think
you
ought
to
be
told
that
your
father
affairs
are
are
not
as
satisfactory
as
they
should
be
i
know
that
we
are
very
poor
said
ida
in
a
low
voice
ah
yes
he
said
and
so
are
a
great
many
of
the
landed
gentry
nowadays
but
they
still
struggle
on
and
i
had
hope
that
by
some
stroke
of
good
luck
i
might
have
helped
your
father
to
struggle
on
and
perhaps
save
something
make
some
provision
for
you
but
my
dear
see
now
i
am
going
to
treat
you
as
if
you
were
indeed
a
woman
and
you
will
be
brave
i
know
for
you
are
a
heron
and
a
heron
it
sounds
like
a
paradox
has
never
shown
the
white
feather
your
father
affairs
have
been
growing
worse
lately
i
am
afraid
you
know
that
the
estate
is
encumbered
that
the
entail
was
cut
off
so
that
you
might
inherit
but
advantage
has
been
taken
of
the
cutting
off
the
entail
to
raise
fresh
loans
since
the
steward
was
dismissed
and
i
have
been
ignorant
of
your
father
business
matters
i
came
to
tell
him
that
the
interest
of
the
heaviest
mortgage
was
long
overdue
and
that
the
mortgagee
who
says
that
he
has
applied
several
times
is
threatening
foreclosure
i
felt
quite
sure
that
i
should
get
the
money
from
your
father
this
morning
but
he
has
put
me
off
and
makes
some
difficulty
he
made
a
rambling
statement
almost
incoherent
which
i
did
not
understand
though
to
be
sure
i
listened
very
intently
and
from
a
word
or
two
he
incautiously
let
drop
i
am
afraid
that
he
stopped
and
frowned
and
puckered
his
lips
as
if
reluctant
to
continue
ida
looked
at
him
steadily
with
her
deep
grey
eyes
go
on
she
said
do
not
be
afraid
to
tell
me
the
truth
i
can
bear
it
i
would
rather
know
the
worst
know
what
i
have
to
face
for
some
time
past
i
have
feared
my
father
was
in
trouble
do
you
think
i
am
afraid
please
tell
me
all
in
a
word
then
my
dear
said
the
old
lawyer
with
a
sigh
i
am
afraid
your
father
has
been
speculating
and
like
out
of
a
hundred
that
do
so
has
been
losing
it
is
like
playing
against
the
bank
at
monte
carlo
one
man
may
break
it
but
the
advantage
is
on
the
bank
side
and
for
the
one
who
wins
thousands
lose
can
you
tell
me
if
there
are
any
grounds
for
my
apprehension
ida
was
silent
for
a
moment
as
she
recalled
her
father
manner
of
late
his
habit
of
shutting
himself
up
in
the
library
of
keeping
his
letters
from
her
of
secreting
papers
and
above
all
the
furtive
glances
which
she
had
now
and
again
seen
him
cast
at
her
i
am
afraid
that
it
is
only
too
true
she
said
my
poor
father
what
is
to
be
done
wordley
can
i
do
anything
the
old
man
shook
his
head
he
knew
too
well
that
once
a
man
has
really
taken
to
gambling
whether
it
be
on
the
stock
exchange
or
at
a
green
table
or
on
the
turf
there
is
very
little
hope
of
saving
him
i
fear
you
can
do
nothing
he
replied
sadly
a
heron
never
yet
brooked
interference
even
by
his
nearest
and
dearest
no
you
must
say
nothing
about
it
even
i
must
be
careful
how
i
approach
him
for
this
morning
he
was
testy
and
irritable
and
resented
the
few
questions
i
ventured
to
put
to
him
do
make
yourself
unhappy
about
it
i
will
try
and
arrange
about
the
mortgage
and
i
will
come
over
again
as
soon
as
possible
and
try
and
persuade
your
father
to
confide
in
me
as
he
used
to
do
now
come
remember
you
are
not
to
worry
yourself
my
dear
but
to
leave
it
entirely
to
me
things
are
rarely
as
bad
as
they
seem
and
there
is
always
a
gleam
of
light
in
the
darkest
sky
perhaps
some
day
we
shall
see
heron
hall
and
the
good
old
family
in
all
its
old
glory
and
when
that
day
comes
my
little
girl
with
the
star
eyes
will
queen
it
in
the
dale
like
one
of
the
heron
ladies
of
the
past
he
patted
her
hand
as
he
held
it
patted
and
stroked
it
and
looked
at
her
with
a
tender
and
encouraging
smile
which
made
ida
eyes
grow
moist
she
rode
down
the
dale
gravely
and
sadly
for
some
minutes
then
the
thought
flashed
through
her
mind
warming
her
heart
that
she
was
not
alone
but
there
was
one
who
loved
her
and
to
whom
she
could
by
for
consolation
and
encouragement
yes
it
was
only
right
that
she
should
tell
stafford
all
there
should
be
no
concealment
from
him
she
rode
down
the
dale
looking
for
him
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
when
she
came
to
the
opening
by
the
lake
she
saw
the
large
white
villa
gleaming
in
the
sunlight
a
launch
was
patting
off
from
the
with
men
and
women
on
board
and
the
could
almost
fancy
that
she
heard
the
sound
of
laughter
the
contrast
of
the
prosperity
typified
by
the
great
white
place
and
the
poverty
of
heron
hall
smote
her
sharply
she
was
poorer
even
than
she
had
thought
what
would
the
great
the
rich
sir
stephen
say
to
such
a
she
watched
the
launch
dreamily
as
it
shot
across
the
lake
and
wondered
whether
stafford
was
on
board
laughing
and
talking
perhaps
with
the
beautiful
miss
falconer
in
this
moment
of
her
trouble
the
thought
was
not
pleasant
but
there
was
no
jealousy
in
it
for
in
her
assurance
of
his
love
he
was
free
to
talk
and
jest
with
whom
he
pleased
she
turned
and
after
making
her
usual
circuit
rode
as
she
reached
the
she
heard
the
sound
of
a
horse
coming
from
the
hall
and
she
pulled
up
her
heart
beating
fast
then
it
sank
with
disappointment
for
the
horseman
came
round
the
bend
and
she
saw
that
it
was
a
groom
he
touched
his
hat
as
he
passed
and
rode
on
at
a
sharp
trot
in
the
direction
of
bryndremere
ida
wondered
why
he
had
been
to
the
hall
but
concluded
that
he
had
gone
there
with
some
message
about
the
farm
produce
when
she
rode
into
the
she
saw
jessie
and
jason
standing
by
the
small
hall
door
and
talking
eagerly
and
jessie
came
forward
and
taking
a
letter
from
under
her
apron
held
it
out
with
a
smile
it
just
come
from
the
villa
miss
ida
she
said
and
oh
miss
what
i
told
you
this
morning
it
quite
true
it
was
own
groom
as
brought
the
note
and
he
says
that
his
master
is
engaged
to
miss
falconer
and
that
the
whole
place
is
in
excitement
over
it
he
was
as
proud
as
punch
miss
ida
for
he
says
that
his
new
mistress
is
terrible
rich
as
well
as
beautiful
and
that
there
be
the
grandest
of
grand
doings
up
there
the
blood
rushed
to
ida
face
for
a
moment
then
faded
and
she
slipped
the
note
into
the
pocket
of
her
habit
and
laughed
for
it
sounded
too
ridiculous
too
incredible
to
cause
her
even
a
shadow
of
annoyance
she
gave
one
or
two
orders
to
jason
then
went
into
the
hall
took
the
note
from
her
pocket
and
looked
at
the
address
lovingly
lingeringly
for
instinctively
she
knew
whose
hand
had
written
it
it
was
the
first
letter
she
had
received
from
him
what
would
it
say
to
her
no
doubt
it
was
to
tell
her
why
he
had
not
been
able
to
meet
her
that
morning
to
ask
her
to
meet
him
later
in
the
day
with
a
blush
of
maidenly
shame
she
lifted
the
envelope
to
her
lips
and
kissed
each
written
word
then
she
opened
it
slowly
as
lingeringly
as
she
had
looked
at
it
spinning
out
the
pleasure
the
delight
which
lay
before
her
in
the
perusal
of
her
first
with
her
foot
upon
the
fender
her
head
drooping
as
if
there
was
someone
present
to
see
her
blushes
she
read
the
letter
and
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
at
first
she
failed
utterly
to
grasp
its
meaning
with
knit
brows
and
quaking
heart
she
read
it
again
and
again
until
its
significance
was
so
to
speak
forced
upon
her
then
the
letter
dropped
from
her
hand
her
arms
fell
limply
to
her
sides
and
she
looked
straight
before
her
in
a
dazed
benumbed
fashion
every
word
burning
itself
upon
her
brain
and
searing
her
heart
the
blow
had
fallen
so
suddenly
so
unexpectedly
like
a
bolt
from
the
blue
smiting
the
happiness
of
her
young
life
as
a
sapling
is
smitten
by
summer
lightning
that
for
the
moment
she
felt
no
pain
nothing
but
the
benumbing
of
all
her
faculties
so
that
she
did
not
see
the
portrait
of
the
dead
and
gone
heron
upon
which
her
eyes
rested
did
not
hear
her
father
voice
calling
to
her
from
the
library
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
those
terrible
words
which
were
dinning
through
her
brain
like
the
booming
of
a
great
bell
presently
she
uttered
a
low
cry
and
clasped
her
head
with
her
hand
as
if
to
shut
out
the
sound
of
the
words
that
tortured
her
it
could
not
be
true
it
could
not
be
true
stafford
had
not
written
it
it
was
some
cruel
jest
a
very
cruel
jest
perpetrated
by
someone
who
hated
them
both
and
who
wantonly
inflicted
pain
yes
that
was
it
that
could
be
the
only
explanation
someone
had
written
in
his
name
it
was
a
forgery
she
would
meet
stafford
presently
and
they
would
laugh
at
it
together
he
would
be
very
angry
would
want
to
punish
the
person
who
had
done
it
but
he
and
she
would
laugh
together
and
he
would
take
her
in
his
arms
and
kiss
her
in
one
of
the
many
ways
in
which
he
had
made
a
kiss
an
ecstasy
of
delight
and
they
would
laugh
together
as
he
whispered
that
nothing
should
ever
separate
them
she
laughed
now
as
she
pictured
the
scene
that
would
be
enacted
but
suddenly
the
laugh
died
on
her
lips
as
there
flashed
across
her
mind
the
words
jessie
had
said
stafford
was
engaged
to
maude
falconer
the
girl
up
at
the
villa
whose
beauty
and
grace
and
wealth
all
the
dale
was
talking
of
oh
god
was
there
any
truth
in
it
was
there
any
truth
in
it
had
stafford
indeed
written
that
cruel
letter
had
he
left
her
forever
forever
forever
should
she
never
see
him
again
never
again
hear
him
tell
her
that
he
loved
her
would
always
love
her
the
room
spun
round
with
her
she
suddenly
felt
sick
and
faint
and
reeling
caught
at
the
carved
to
prevent
herself
from
falling
then
gradually
the
faintness
passed
and
she
became
conscious
that
her
father
voice
was
calling
to
her
and
she
clasped
her
head
again
and
swept
the
hair
from
her
forehead
and
clenched
her
hands
in
the
effort
to
gain
her
presence
of
mind
and
she
picked
up
the
letter
and
with
a
shudder
thrust
it
in
her
bosom
as
cleopatra
might
have
thrust
the
asp
which
was
to
destroy
her
then
with
leaden
feet
she
crossed
the
hall
and
opened
the
library
door
and
saw
her
father
standing
by
the
table
clutching
some
papers
in
one
hand
and
gesticulating
wildly
with
the
other
dizzily
for
there
seemed
to
be
a
mist
before
her
eyes
she
went
to
him
and
laid
a
hand
upon
his
arm
what
is
it
father
she
said
are
you
ill
what
is
the
matter
he
gazed
at
her
vacantly
and
struck
his
hand
on
the
table
after
the
manner
of
a
child
in
a
senseless
passion
lost
lost
all
lost
he
mumbled
jumbling
the
words
together
almost
incoherently
what
is
lost
father
she
asked
everything
everything
he
cried
in
the
same
manner
i
remember
ca
remember
it
ruin
utter
ruin
my
head
i
think
ca
remember
lost
lost
in
her
terror
she
put
her
young
arm
round
him
as
a
mother
encircles
her
child
in
the
delirium
of
fever
try
and
tell
me
father
she
implored
him
try
and
be
calm
dearest
tell
me
and
i
will
help
you
what
is
lost
he
tried
to
struggle
from
her
arms
tried
to
push
her
from
him
you
know
he
mumbled
you
watched
me
you
know
the
truth
everything
is
lost
i
am
ruined
the
mortgage
herondale
will
pass
away
i
am
a
poor
man
a
very
poor
man
have
pity
on
me
have
pity
on
me
he
slipped
by
their
weight
from
her
arms
and
fell
into
the
chair
she
sank
on
to
her
knees
her
arms
still
round
him
and
stroked
and
caressed
his
withered
hand
that
twitched
and
shook
and
to
her
horror
his
stony
eyes
grew
more
vacant
his
jaw
dropped
and
he
sank
still
lower
in
the
chair
jessie
jason
she
called
and
they
rushed
in
for
a
space
they
stood
aghast
and
unhelpful
from
fright
then
jason
tried
to
lift
his
master
from
the
heap
into
which
he
had
collapsed
the
old
man
eyes
closed
he
straggled
for
breath
and
when
he
had
gained
it
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
a
smile
a
senile
smile
which
added
to
ida
grief
and
terror
it
all
right
he
whispered
huskily
pantingly
it
all
right
they
do
know
they
do
guess
then
his
manner
changed
to
one
of
intense
alarm
and
dismay
lost
lost
he
gasped
i
ruined
rained
herondale
has
gone
gone
all
is
gone
my
poor
child
ida
father
broke
from
ida
white
lips
father
i
am
here
look
at
me
speak
to
me
i
am
here
everything
is
not
lost
i
am
here
and
all
is
well
his
lips
twisted
into
a
smile
a
smile
of
cunning
almost
of
glee
then
he
groaned
and
the
cry
rose
again
i
ca
remember
all
is
lost
ruined
my
poor
child
have
pity
on
my
child
as
she
clung
to
him
supporting
him
as
she
clung
she
felt
a
shudder
run
through
him
and
he
fell
a
lifeless
heap
upon
her
shoulder
the
minutes
were
they
minutes
or
years
passed
and
were
broken
into
fragments
by
a
cry
from
jessie
miss
ida
miss
ida
he
the
master
dead
ida
raised
her
father
head
from
her
shoulder
and
looked
into
his
face
and
knew
that
the
girl
had
spoken
the
truth
he
was
dead
she
had
lost
both
father
and
lover
in
one
day
chapter
xxvi
ida
sat
in
the
library
on
the
morning
of
the
funeral
a
pelting
rain
beat
upon
the
windows
over
which
the
blinds
had
been
drawn
the
great
silence
which
reigned
in
the
chamber
above
in
which
the
dead
master
of
heron
lay
brooded
over
the
whole
house
and
seemed
in
no
part
of
it
more
intense
than
in
this
great
room
in
which
godfrey
heron
had
spent
so
much
of
his
life
ida
lay
back
in
the
great
in
which
he
had
sat
her
small
brown
hands
lying
limply
in
her
lap
her
eyes
fixed
absently
upon
the
open
book
which
lay
on
the
table
as
he
had
left
it
the
pallor
of
her
face
increased
by
her
sorrow
was
accentuated
by
the
black
dress
almost
as
plainly
made
as
that
which
the
jessie
wore
in
her
kitchen
though
nearly
a
week
had
elapsed
since
her
father
had
died
in
her
young
arms
and
notwithstanding
her
capacity
for
ida
had
not
yet
recovered
from
the
stupor
of
the
shock
she
was
scarcely
thinking
as
she
lay
back
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
the
table
over
which
he
had
bent
for
so
many
monotonous
years
she
scarcely
realised
that
he
had
passed
out
of
her
life
and
that
she
was
alone
in
the
world
and
she
was
only
vaguely
conscious
that
her
sorrow
had
so
to
speak
a
double
edge
that
she
had
lost
not
only
her
father
but
the
man
to
whom
she
had
given
her
heart
the
man
who
should
have
been
standing
beside
her
now
shielding
her
with
his
strong
arms
comforting
her
with
words
of
pity
and
love
the
double
blow
had
fallen
so
suddenly
so
unexpectedly
that
the
pain
of
it
had
been
dulled
and
blunted
the
capacity
of
human
nature
for
suffering
is
after
all
not
unlimited
god
says
to
physical
pain
and
mental
anguish
thus
far
and
no
farther
and
this
limitation
saved
ida
from
utter
collapse
then
again
she
was
not
free
to
indulge
in
idle
grief
in
the
luxury
of
woe
the
great
house
had
still
to
be
run
she
had
to
bury
her
beloved
dead
the
mourning
which
seems
such
a
hopeless
mockery
when
the
heart
is
racked
with
misery
had
to
be
seen
to
and
she
did
it
and
went
through
it
all
with
outward
calm
sustained
by
that
heron
spirit
which
may
be
described
as
the
religion
of
her
class
jessie
had
wept
loudly
through
the
house
ever
since
the
death
and
could
weep
as
loudly
now
but
if
ida
shed
any
tears
she
wept
in
the
silence
and
darkness
of
her
own
room
and
no
one
heard
her
utter
a
moan
to
suffer
in
silence
and
be
strong
was
the
badge
of
all
her
tribe
and
she
wore
it
with
quiet
stoicism
godfrey
heron
death
had
happened
so
suddenly
that
the
news
of
it
scarcely
got
beyond
the
radius
of
the
estate
before
the
following
morning
and
stafford
had
gone
to
london
in
ignorance
of
this
second
blow
with
which
fate
had
followed
up
the
one
he
had
dealt
ida
and
when
the
neighbours
the
vaynes
the
bannerdales
and
the
avorys
came
quickly
and
readily
enough
to
offer
their
sympathy
and
help
they
could
do
nothing
the
girl
solitary
and
lonely
in
her
grief
as
she
had
been
solitary
and
lonely
through
her
life
would
see
no
one
but
the
doctor
and
wordley
and
the
people
who
had
once
been
warm
and
intimate
friends
of
the
family
left
reluctantly
and
sully
to
talk
over
the
melancholy
circumstance
and
to
wonder
what
would
become
of
the
daughter
of
the
eccentric
man
who
had
lived
the
life
of
a
recluse
wordley
would
have
liked
to
have
persuaded
her
to
see
some
of
the
women
who
had
hastened
to
comfort
her
but
he
knew
that
any
attempt
at
persuasion
would
have
been
in
vain
that
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
break
down
the
barrier
of
reserve
which
the
girl
had
instinctively
and
reservedly
erected
between
her
suffering
soul
and
the
world
his
heart
ached
for
her
and
he
did
all
that
a
man
could
do
to
lighten
the
burden
of
her
trouble
but
there
was
very
little
that
he
could
do
beyond
superintending
the
necessary
arrangements
for
the
funeral
his
first
thought
was
of
the
relatives
but
somewhat
to
his
own
dismay
he
found
that
the
only
one
whom
he
could
trace
was
a
certain
cousin
a
more
than
man
who
though
he
bore
the
name
of
heron
was
quite
unknown
to
ida
and
so
far
as
wordley
was
aware
had
not
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
hall
for
many
years
he
was
a
certain
john
heron
a
retired
barrister
who
had
gone
in
for
religion
not
in
the
form
of
either
of
the
established
churches
but
of
that
of
one
of
the
least
known
sects
the
members
of
which
called
themselves
some
kind
of
brothers
were
supposed
to
be
very
strict
observers
of
the
scriptural
law
and
were
considered
by
those
who
did
not
belong
to
them
both
and
uncharitable
john
heron
was
a
prominent
member
of
this
little
sect
and
was
famous
in
its
small
circles
for
his
extreme
sanctity
and
his
eloquence
as
a
lay
preacher
wordley
with
much
misgiving
had
invited
this
the
only
relative
he
could
find
to
the
funeral
and
ida
was
now
awaiting
this
gentleman
arrival
the
stealthy
footsteps
which
belong
to
those
who
minister
to
the
dead
passed
up
and
down
the
great
house
jason
was
setting
out
the
simple
funeral
baked
meats
which
are
considered
appropriate
to
the
occasion
and
wordley
paced
up
and
down
the
hall
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
listening
to
the
undertaker
men
upstairs
and
glancing
through
the
window
in
expectation
of
the
carriage
which
had
been
sent
for
john
heron
presently
he
saw
it
rounding
a
bend
of
the
drive
and
went
into
the
library
to
prepare
ida
she
raised
her
head
but
not
her
eyes
as
he
entered
and
looked
at
him
with
that
dull
apathy
which
denotes
the
benumbed
heart
the
mind
crushed
under
its
heavy
weight
of
sorrow
i
came
in
to
tell
you
my
dear
that
john
heron
is
coming
he
said
the
carriage
is
just
turning
the
bend
of
the
drive
i
will
come
she
said
rising
and
supporting
herself
by
the
heavy
carved
arm
of
the
great
chair
no
no
he
said
sit
down
and
wait
here
he
did
not
want
her
to
hear
the
stealthy
tread
of
the
undertaker
men
to
meet
the
coffin
which
they
were
going
to
bring
downstairs
and
place
in
the
hall
i
will
bring
him
in
here
is
there
anything
you
would
like
me
to
say
to
him
my
dear
he
asked
and
spoke
with
a
certain
hesitancy
for
as
yet
he
had
not
spoken
of
her
future
feeling
that
her
grief
was
too
recent
too
sacred
to
permit
of
the
obtrusion
of
material
and
worldly
matters
to
say
to
him
she
repeated
in
a
low
dull
voice
as
if
she
did
not
understand
yes
he
said
i
did
not
know
whether
you
had
formed
any
plan
whether
he
hesitated
again
you
had
thought
of
going
of
paying
a
visit
to
these
relations
of
yours
he
lives
in
the
north
of
london
and
has
a
wife
and
son
and
daughter
as
you
know
ida
passed
her
hand
across
her
brow
trying
to
remember
ah
yes
she
said
at
last
i
remember
you
told
me
about
them
i
never
heard
of
them
before
until
now
why
should
i
go
to
them
do
they
want
me
have
they
asked
me
wordley
coughed
discreetly
they
certainly
had
not
asked
her
but
he
felt
quite
assured
that
an
individual
whose
reputation
for
sanctity
stood
so
high
could
not
be
so
deficient
in
charity
as
to
refuse
a
home
to
his
orphan
cousin
they
have
not
sent
you
any
definite
invitation
yet
but
they
will
be
sure
to
want
you
to
go
and
stay
with
them
for
a
time
at
any
rate
and
i
think
you
ought
to
go
i
do
not
think
i
should
like
it
said
ida
but
indifferently
as
if
the
question
were
of
no
moment
i
would
rather
stay
here
wordley
polished
his
glasses
very
intently
i
am
afraid
you
find
it
very
lonely
at
the
hall
my
dear
he
said
in
fact
i
do
think
you
could
remain
here
by
yourself
he
added
evading
the
direct
gaze
of
the
great
sad
eyes
i
should
feel
lonely
anywhere
she
said
more
lonely
with
people
i
do
know
probably
than
i
should
feel
here
with
jessie
and
jason
and
and
the
dogs
well
well
we
ca
discuss
the
question
now
and
will
endeavour
to
act
for
the
best
my
dear
said
the
old
man
still
intent
upon
his
glasses
i
hear
the
carriage
i
will
bring
john
in
he
returned
in
a
minute
or
two
accompanied
by
a
tall
and
gaunt
individual
who
in
his
black
clothes
and
white
necktie
looked
a
cross
between
a
superior
undertaker
and
a
methodist
preacher
his
features
were
strongly
marked
and
the
expression
of
his
countenance
was
both
severe
and
melancholy
and
judging
by
his
expression
and
his
voice
which
was
harsh
and
lachrymose
his
particular
form
of
religion
did
not
appear
to
afford
him
either
amusement
or
consolation
this
is
your
cousin
john
heron
said
poor
wordley
who
was
evidently
suffering
from
the
effects
of
his
few
minutes
conversation
with
that
gentleman
john
heron
surveyed
the
slight
figure
and
white
face
with
its
sad
eyes
surveyed
it
with
a
grim
kind
of
severity
which
was
probably
intended
for
sympathy
and
extending
a
cold
damp
hand
which
resembled
an
extremely
bony
shoulder
of
mutton
said
in
a
rasping
melancholy
voice
how
do
you
do
ida
i
trust
you
are
bearing
your
burden
as
becomes
a
christian
we
are
born
to
sorrow
the
train
was
of
an
hour
late
i
am
sorry
said
ida
in
her
low
voice
leaving
him
to
judge
whether
she
expressed
regret
for
our
birthright
of
misery
or
the
lateness
of
the
train
will
you
have
some
lunch
some
wine
she
asked
a
dull
vague
wonder
rising
in
her
mind
that
this
grim
man
should
be
of
kith
and
kin
with
her
dead
father
thank
you
no
i
had
an
abernethy
biscuit
at
the
station
he
drew
back
from
and
waved
away
the
tray
of
wine
which
jason
at
this
moment
brought
in
i
never
touch
wine
i
and
all
mine
are
total
abstainers
those
who
fly
to
the
in
moments
of
tribulation
and
grief
rely
on
a
broken
reed
which
shall
pierce
their
hand
i
trust
you
do
not
drink
cousin
ida
no
yes
sometimes
not
much
she
replied
vaguely
and
regarding
him
with
a
dull
wonder
for
she
had
never
seen
this
kind
of
man
before
wordley
poured
out
a
glass
of
wine
and
in
silent
indignation
handed
it
to
her
and
unconscious
of
the
heavy
scowl
with
which
john
heron
regarded
her
she
put
her
lips
to
it
a
glass
of
wine
is
not
a
bad
thing
at
any
time
said
the
old
lawyer
especially
when
one
is
weakened
and
prostrated
by
trouble
try
and
drink
a
little
more
my
dear
it
is
a
matter
of
opinion
of
conviction
of
principle
said
john
heron
grimly
as
if
he
were
in
the
pulpit
we
must
be
guided
by
the
light
of
our
consciences
we
must
not
yield
to
the
seductive
in
fineness
of
creature
comfort
we
are
told
that
strong
drink
is
raging
this
was
rather
more
than
wordley
could
stand
and
very
red
in
the
face
he
invited
john
heron
to
go
up
to
the
room
which
had
been
prepared
for
him
when
that
gentleman
had
stalked
out
the
old
lawyer
looked
at
ida
with
a
mixture
of
dismay
and
commiseration
not
a
er
particularly
cheerful
and
genial
person
my
dear
but
no
doubt
john
heron
is
extremely
conscientious
and
er
i
daresay
assented
ida
apathetically
it
does
not
matter
it
was
very
kind
of
him
to
come
so
far
to
to
the
funeral
she
added
he
might
have
stayed
away
for
i
do
think
my
father
knew
him
and
i
never
heard
of
him
is
it
not
time
yet
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
as
she
spoke
jessie
came
in
and
took
her
upstairs
to
her
room
to
put
on
the
thick
black
cloak
the
bonnet
with
its
long
crape
veil
in
which
ida
was
to
follow
her
father
to
the
grave
for
in
spite
of
wordley
remonstrances
she
had
remained
firm
in
her
resolve
to
go
to
the
presently
the
procession
started
only
a
few
carriages
followed
the
hearse
which
bore
godfrey
heron
to
his
last
but
when
the
vehicles
cradled
beyond
the
boundary
of
the
grounds
across
which
the
dead
man
had
not
set
foot
for
thirty
years
the
cavalcade
was
swelled
by
a
number
of
tenants
labourers
and
dalesmen
who
had
come
to
pay
their
last
respects
to
heron
of
herondale
and
marching
in
threes
which
appears
to
be
the
regulation
number
for
a
funeral
they
made
a
long
and
winding
tail
to
the
crawling
coaches
quite
filled
the
little
church
and
stood
a
crowd
in
the
pelting
rain
round
the
oblong
hole
which
would
suffice
for
the
last
bed
of
this
one
of
the
last
of
the
lords
of
the
dale
but
though
all
were
present
to
show
respect
to
the
deceased
squire
the
attention
of
every
man
and
woman
was
fixed
upon
the
slight
girlish
figure
standing
by
the
side
of
the
grave
her
head
bent
her
great
mournful
eye
fixed
upon
the
coffin
her
hands
clenched
tightly
as
they
held
together
the
thick
mourning
cloak
she
looked
so
young
so
almost
in
the
desolation
of
her
solitude
that
many
of
the
women
cried
silently
and
the
rough
men
set
their
lips
hard
and
looked
sternly
and
grimly
at
the
ground
the
old
clergyman
who
had
christened
her
and
every
sunday
had
cast
glances
of
interest
and
affection
at
her
as
she
sat
in
the
great
loose
box
of
a
pew
found
it
very
difficult
to
read
the
solemn
service
without
breaking
down
and
his
old
thin
voice
quavered
as
he
spoke
the
words
of
hope
and
consolation
which
the
storm
of
wind
and
rain
caught
up
and
swept
across
the
narrow
and
down
the
dale
of
which
the
herons
had
been
so
long
masters
john
heron
stood
grim
and
gaunt
opposite
ida
as
if
he
were
a
figure
carved
out
of
wood
and
showed
no
sign
of
animation
until
the
end
of
the
service
when
he
looked
round
with
a
sudden
eagerness
and
opened
his
large
square
lips
as
if
he
were
going
to
improve
the
occasion
by
an
address
but
wordley
who
suspected
him
of
such
intention
nipped
it
in
the
bud
by
saying
will
you
give
your
arm
to
miss
ida
heron
i
want
to
get
her
back
to
the
hall
as
soon
as
possible
ida
was
led
to
the
carriage
passing
through
a
lane
of
sympathisers
amongst
whom
were
representatives
of
all
the
great
dale
families
and
all
bent
their
heads
with
a
respectful
pity
and
sympathy
as
the
young
girl
made
her
way
down
the
narrow
path
about
half
a
dozen
persons
had
been
asked
to
go
to
the
hall
for
the
funeral
lunch
at
which
john
heron
as
representative
of
the
family
presided
it
was
a
melancholy
meal
for
most
of
those
present
were
thinking
of
the
orphan
girl
in
her
room
above
they
spoke
in
lowered
voices
of
the
dead
man
and
of
the
great
family
from
which
he
had
sprung
and
recalled
stories
of
the
wealth
and
lavishness
of
past
herons
and
when
the
meal
was
over
there
suddenly
fell
a
silence
and
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
wordley
for
the
moment
had
arrived
for
the
reading
and
expounding
of
the
will
wordley
rose
coughed
and
wiped
his
and
looked
round
gravely
as
the
legal
adviser
of
my
late
client
godfrey
heron
i
have
to
inform
you
gentlemen
that
there
is
no
will
my
client
died
intestate
the
listeners
exchanged
glances
and
looked
grave
and
concerned
no
will
said
lord
bannerdale
anxiously
then
his
kindly
face
cleared
but
of
course
everything
goes
to
his
daughter
the
estate
is
not
entailed
wordley
inclined
his
head
the
estate
is
not
entailed
as
you
observed
lord
bannerdale
and
my
client
miss
ida
heron
inherits
everything
they
drew
a
breath
of
relief
and
nodded
assentingly
and
presently
they
made
a
general
movement
of
departure
lord
bannerdale
lingered
behind
the
others
i
wo
ask
the
poor
child
to
see
me
wordley
he
said
will
you
therefore
be
good
enough
to
give
her
lady
bannerdale
love
and
to
tell
her
that
as
lady
bannerdale
has
written
to
her
we
shall
be
more
than
pleased
if
she
will
come
to
us
at
the
court
she
is
to
consider
it
her
home
for
just
as
long
as
she
should
please
and
we
shall
feel
it
a
pleasure
and
an
honour
to
have
her
amongst
us
as
one
of
our
own
of
course
she
can
not
remain
alone
here
in
this
great
place
the
old
lawyer
bowed
i
will
give
her
your
kind
message
for
which
i
thank
you
on
her
behalf
lord
bannerdale
i
do
not
know
what
she
will
do
or
where
she
will
go
at
present
she
is
not
in
a
condition
to
discuss
any
plans
for
her
future
though
she
expressed
a
desire
to
remain
at
the
hall
he
paused
for
a
moment
before
he
added
i
do
not
know
whether
she
can
do
so
my
cousin
is
young
and
a
mere
child
and
she
must
follow
the
advice
of
her
elders
and
her
guardian
the
future
of
even
the
sparrow
is
in
higher
hands
than
ours
and
we
know
not
what
a
day
may
bring
forth
said
john
heron
grimly
and
with
an
uplifting
of
his
heavy
brows
quite
so
said
lord
bannerdale
who
had
taken
a
great
dislike
for
the
sanctimonious
speaker
and
who
could
scarcely
repress
a
shudder
as
he
shook
john
heron
cold
and
clammy
hand
when
they
had
all
gone
wordley
said
we
had
better
go
into
the
library
and
talk
matters
over
i
will
send
for
miss
ida
it
seems
cruel
to
disturb
her
at
such
a
moment
but
there
is
no
help
for
it
you
speak
as
if
you
had
bad
tidings
wordley
to
give
us
said
john
heron
i
am
afraid
i
have
responded
the
old
lawyer
shaking
his
grey
head
sadly
chapter
xxvii
when
ida
came
down
he
led
her
to
a
chair
beside
the
fire
which
he
had
ordered
to
be
lit
and
laid
his
hand
gently
and
tenderly
on
her
shoulder
by
way
of
preparation
and
encouragement
your
cousin
and
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
the
future
ida
he
said
you
will
have
to
be
told
some
time
or
other
exactly
how
your
affairs
stood
and
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
better
you
should
know
at
once
than
that
you
should
be
permitted
to
remain
in
ignorance
of
the
gravity
of
the
situation
i
have
gone
over
your
father
papers
and
looked
into
his
affairs
very
carefully
and
closely
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
they
are
in
a
very
unsatisfactory
condition
as
i
told
you
the
other
day
the
estate
has
been
encumbered
and
very
seriously
embarrassed
for
some
time
past
and
the
encumbrance
has
been
increased
of
late
notwithstanding
the
admirable
way
in
which
you
have
managed
the
estate
and
the
household
affairs
ida
raised
her
eyes
to
his
and
tried
to
regard
him
calmly
and
bravely
but
her
lips
quivered
and
she
checked
a
sigh
wordley
coughed
and
frowned
as
a
man
does
when
he
is
engaged
in
a
disagreeable
and
painful
task
the
principal
mortgagee
has
given
me
notice
of
foreclosure
and
the
amount
of
the
debt
is
so
large
that
i
am
afraid
it
would
be
cruel
and
useless
to
conceal
the
truth
from
you
i
that
the
property
sold
would
not
be
sufficient
to
meet
it
of
ready
money
there
appears
to
be
none
john
heron
groaned
and
raised
his
melancholy
eyes
to
the
ceiling
with
an
expression
of
reprobation
ida
appeared
unconscious
of
his
presence
and
kept
her
sad
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
the
lawyer
kind
and
mournful
face
in
a
word
my
dear
child
your
poor
father
appears
to
have
left
absolutely
no
effects
behind
him
ida
drew
a
long
breath
and
was
silent
for
a
moment
as
she
tried
to
realise
the
significance
of
his
words
do
you
mean
that
i
am
quite
penniless
she
said
in
a
low
voice
wordley
blew
his
nose
and
coughed
two
or
three
times
as
if
he
found
it
difficult
to
reply
at
last
he
said
in
a
voice
almost
as
low
as
hers
put
shortly
i
am
afraid
my
dear
that
is
what
i
must
tell
you
i
had
no
idea
that
the
position
was
so
grave
i
thought
that
there
would
be
something
left
sufficient
at
any
rate
to
render
you
independent
but
as
i
told
you
i
have
been
kept
in
ignorance
of
your
affairs
for
some
years
past
and
i
did
not
know
how
things
were
going
i
am
surprised
as
well
as
grieved
deeply
grieved
and
i
must
confess
that
i
can
only
account
for
the
deplorable
confusion
and
loss
by
the
theory
that
i
suggested
to
you
the
other
day
i
can
not
but
think
that
your
poor
father
must
have
engaged
in
some
disastrous
speculation
heron
groaned
again
and
shook
his
head
the
prevailing
vice
of
this
most
wicked
of
ages
he
said
the
love
of
money
the
gambling
on
the
and
the
stock
exchange
are
the
root
of
all
evil
ida
seemed
not
to
hear
him
and
wordley
ignored
the
comment
it
now
remains
for
you
my
dear
child
to
decide
what
to
do
i
do
not
think
you
could
possibly
live
on
here
you
have
not
the
means
to
do
so
though
you
should
be
as
economical
as
you
have
been
in
the
past
the
house
must
pass
away
from
you
in
six
months
time
or
little
more
and
there
would
be
nothing
gained
by
your
lingering
hopelessly
here
for
that
period
i
must
go
then
said
ida
as
if
there
were
a
stab
in
every
word
wordley
bent
his
head
and
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
yes
i
fear
you
must
go
he
assented
but
thank
god
you
are
not
without
friends
many
friends
lord
bannerdale
charges
me
to
tell
you
what
his
good
wife
has
already
written
you
that
a
home
awaits
you
at
the
court
where
you
will
be
received
gladly
and
lovingly
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
door
of
every
house
in
the
dale
is
wide
open
for
you
ida
shrank
in
her
chair
clothe
the
offer
as
kindly
as
he
might
it
spelt
charity
not
cold
charity
but
charity
still
and
what
heron
had
ever
tamely
accepted
charity
from
mere
friends
and
strangers
wordley
saw
the
shrinking
the
little
shudder
and
understood
i
understand
my
dear
he
said
in
a
low
voice
but
there
is
another
offer
another
home
which
you
can
accept
without
humiliation
or
compunction
your
cousin
john
heron
here
will
i
am
sure
be
only
too
glad
too
delighted
to
to
he
waited
and
glanced
at
heron
impatiently
and
at
last
that
gentleman
rose
but
not
too
eagerly
to
the
occasion
i
need
scarcely
say
he
said
slowly
and
solemnly
that
i
should
not
approve
of
my
cousin
accepting
these
offers
of
charity
which
though
no
doubt
kindly
meant
appear
to
me
somewhat
er
obtrusive
i
am
not
a
wealthy
man
my
simple
home
can
not
compare
in
size
and
grandeur
with
heron
hall
and
the
estate
which
my
late
unfortunate
cousin
appears
to
have
squandered
but
such
as
it
is
ida
will
be
welcome
in
it
i
am
not
one
to
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
the
cry
of
the
orphan
and
fatherless
wordley
frowned
and
reddened
and
cut
in
before
john
heron
could
finish
his
sentence
even
more
offensively
and
so
rouse
spirit
and
render
his
offer
impossible
of
acceptance
quite
so
quite
so
my
dear
sir
he
said
i
am
quite
sure
you
will
feel
only
too
delighted
and
honoured
at
the
prospect
of
taking
this
dear
child
into
your
family
yes
said
heron
unctuously
we
will
take
her
in
as
a
lamb
gathered
into
the
fold
as
a
brand
is
plucked
from
the
burning
ida
looked
at
him
half
stupefied
and
it
is
to
be
feared
some
doubts
of
his
sanity
arose
in
her
mind
quite
so
quite
so
interrupted
wordley
again
then
i
think
the
sooner
miss
ida
joins
you
the
better
and
i
would
suggest
that
she
goes
with
you
i
will
close
the
house
and
leave
jessie
the
and
jason
in
charge
you
and
miss
ida
can
depend
on
my
guarding
her
interests
as
jealously
as
if
they
were
my
own
i
will
have
a
sale
of
the
stock
and
other
things
which
we
are
free
to
sell
and
meanwhile
miss
ida
must
permit
me
to
advance
her
some
money
on
account
of
the
proceeds
he
handed
her
an
envelope
in
which
he
had
already
placed
some
but
ida
looked
at
him
and
slowly
shook
her
head
no
no
my
dear
he
said
i
should
not
be
guilty
of
such
presumption
though
you
are
leaving
heron
hall
though
it
may
be
passing
away
from
you
forever
you
are
still
in
my
eyes
miss
heron
of
herondale
and
i
should
not
presume
to
offer
you
his
voice
broke
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
the
money
is
yours
and
you
can
take
it
without
any
loss
of
the
pride
which
is
your
rightful
heritage
if
i
have
not
offered
you
a
home
where
you
would
indeed
be
an
honoured
guest
it
is
because
i
know
that
it
would
not
be
fitting
for
me
to
offer
it
or
you
to
accept
it
john
heron
is
your
natural
guardian
but
though
that
is
so
i
will
ask
you
to
remember
that
i
claim
the
privilege
of
being
your
father
friend
and
yours
and
that
in
any
trouble
you
will
be
but
honouring
that
privilege
when
you
come
to
me
for
advice
and
assistance
his
voice
was
almost
inaudible
before
he
had
finished
and
ida
down
whose
cheek
tears
were
running
for
the
first
time
extended
both
hands
in
mute
but
eloquent
gratitude
they
had
both
forgotten
john
heron
presence
but
were
reminded
of
it
by
something
between
a
cough
and
a
sniff
from
him
and
at
a
glance
from
wordley
ida
turned
to
the
gaunt
figure
and
held
out
her
hand
thank
you
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
will
come
with
you
and
stay
with
you
until
until
i
can
find
something
to
do
something
at
which
i
can
earn
my
own
living
surely
there
must
be
something
i
can
do
she
turned
to
wordley
with
a
little
anxious
eager
gesture
i
am
strong
very
strong
i
have
managed
herondale
i
can
ride
and
and
understand
a
farm
i
am
never
tired
surely
there
is
something
i
can
do
her
voice
broke
she
began
to
tremble
and
the
tears
started
to
her
eyes
again
yes
yes
no
doubt
no
doubt
my
child
said
wordley
whose
own
eyes
were
moist
we
will
think
about
all
that
later
on
you
must
go
now
and
rest
you
are
tired
he
drew
her
arm
within
his
and
patting
her
hand
tenderly
and
encouragingly
led
her
out
of
the
room
and
stood
in
the
hall
watching
her
as
she
slowly
went
up
the
great
stairs
such
a
girlish
mournful
figure
in
her
plain
black
dress
ida
lay
awake
that
night
listening
to
the
wind
and
the
rain
she
was
familiar
enough
with
the
dale
storms
but
never
had
their
wild
music
wailed
so
mournful
an
accompaniment
to
her
own
thoughts
compared
with
her
other
losses
that
of
her
home
dearly
as
she
loved
it
weighed
but
little
it
was
but
an
added
pang
to
the
anguish
of
her
bereavement
and
behind
that
the
principal
cause
of
her
grief
loomed
the
desertion
of
her
lover
she
tried
not
to
think
of
stafford
for
every
thought
bestowed
on
him
seemed
to
rob
her
dead
father
and
to
be
disloyal
to
his
memory
but
alas
the
human
heart
is
despotic
and
as
she
lay
awake
and
listened
to
the
wailing
of
the
wind
and
the
rain
as
it
drove
against
the
window
stafford
voice
penetrated
that
of
the
storm
and
scarcely
consciously
her
lips
were
forming
some
of
the
passionate
words
of
endearment
which
he
had
whispered
to
her
by
the
stream
and
on
the
though
she
knew
every
word
by
heart
of
the
letter
he
had
written
her
she
did
not
yet
understand
or
comprehend
why
he
had
broken
his
solemn
engagement
to
her
she
understood
that
something
had
risen
between
them
something
had
happened
which
had
separated
them
but
she
could
form
no
idea
as
to
what
it
was
he
had
spoken
of
unworthiness
of
something
which
he
had
discovered
that
had
rendered
him
unfit
to
be
her
husband
but
she
could
not
guess
what
it
was
but
confused
and
bewildered
as
she
was
there
was
at
present
at
any
rate
no
resentment
in
her
heart
the
lover
had
been
taken
from
her
just
as
her
father
and
her
home
had
been
there
was
no
help
for
it
there
was
no
appeal
from
the
decrees
of
fate
fate
had
decreed
that
she
should
love
stafford
and
lose
him
and
she
could
only
go
on
living
her
grey
and
dreary
life
made
all
the
greyer
and
drearier
by
her
short
spell
of
joy
and
happiness
crown
of
sorrow
is
still
the
remembrance
of
happier
things
and
she
would
have
to
wear
that
crown
in
place
of
the
crown
of
his
love
wear
it
through
all
her
days
for
young
as
she
was
she
knew
that
she
had
given
her
heart
once
and
for
all
that
though
she
might
never
see
stafford
again
she
would
love
him
to
the
end
a
mist
hung
over
the
dale
on
this
the
day
of
her
departure
from
the
hall
and
all
the
hills
over
which
she
had
so
loved
to
ride
and
walk
were
shrouded
as
if
in
tears
she
stood
and
looked
at
them
from
the
hall
window
with
vacant
eyes
as
if
she
did
not
yet
realise
that
she
was
leaving
them
perhaps
forever
but
she
had
not
long
for
gazing
for
heron
and
she
were
going
by
an
early
train
and
the
moment
for
farewell
came
swiftly
upon
her
with
donald
and
bess
close
at
her
heels
as
if
they
were
aware
of
their
coming
loss
she
went
round
to
say
she
crossed
the
lawn
and
went
to
the
spot
under
the
tree
where
she
had
met
stafford
that
night
and
from
thence
walked
to
the
corner
of
the
terrace
where
they
had
stood
and
watched
her
father
coming
in
his
sleep
from
the
ruined
chapel
then
she
went
to
the
stable
to
say
to
rupert
who
whinnied
as
he
heard
her
approaching
footstep
and
thrust
his
soft
velvety
nose
into
her
neck
she
had
to
fight
hard
against
the
tears
at
this
point
and
she
hid
her
face
against
that
of
the
big
horse
with
her
arms
thrown
round
his
neck
as
she
murmured
her
last
but
the
tears
would
not
be
kept
back
when
it
came
to
saying
farewell
to
the
two
faithful
souls
jessie
and
jason
with
whom
she
had
grown
up
from
a
girl
all
legs
and
wings
and
whom
she
had
learnt
to
regard
rather
as
devoted
friends
than
servants
jason
broke
down
completely
and
hurried
away
his
old
and
feeble
frame
shaking
like
an
autumn
leaf
and
jessie
her
arms
thrown
round
her
young
mistress
and
with
sobs
and
ejaculations
implored
her
to
take
her
faithful
jessie
with
her
perhaps
the
parting
with
the
two
dogs
was
as
bitter
as
any
for
as
if
they
knew
quite
well
that
she
was
going
they
clung
closely
to
her
and
when
she
hugged
them
and
kissed
them
on
the
forehead
they
had
to
be
dragged
off
by
jason
and
locked
up
in
the
stables
lest
they
should
follow
the
carriage
which
was
to
bear
their
beloved
mistress
away
that
carriage
came
all
too
soon
though
john
heron
had
awaited
its
arrival
impatiently
and
with
watch
in
hand
he
seemed
grimmer
and
gaunter
than
ever
that
morning
and
as
he
looked
around
the
great
hall
he
shook
his
head
at
its
faded
grandeur
reprehensively
as
if
he
could
if
time
permitted
deliver
a
sermon
on
the
prodigality
the
wicked
wastefulness
which
had
brought
ruin
on
the
house
and
rendered
it
necessary
for
him
to
extend
his
charity
to
the
penniless
orphan
wordley
was
there
to
say
to
ida
and
put
her
into
the
carriage
but
it
proved
a
difficult
to
say
and
for
once
the
usually
fluent
old
lawyer
was
bereft
of
the
power
of
speech
as
he
held
ida
small
hand
and
looked
through
eyes
at
the
white
and
sorrowful
face
he
had
intended
to
say
all
sorts
of
kind
and
encouraging
things
but
he
could
only
manage
the
two
words
and
they
were
almost
inaudible
she
sank
back
into
the
carriage
as
it
drove
away
from
the
hall
and
closed
her
eyes
that
she
might
not
see
the
familiar
trees
in
the
avenue
the
cattle
everyone
of
which
she
knew
by
name
grazing
in
the
meadow
the
pale
and
faces
of
the
servants
who
stood
by
the
steps
to
catch
the
last
glimpse
of
their
beloved
and
for
some
time
her
eyes
remained
closed
but
they
opened
as
she
came
to
the
clearing
by
the
lake
from
which
one
could
see
the
long
stretching
façade
of
sir
stephen
orme
white
villa
she
opened
them
then
and
looked
at
the
house
wondering
whether
stafford
was
there
wondering
why
he
had
not
come
to
her
despite
the
promise
she
had
exacted
from
him
wondering
whether
he
knew
that
her
father
was
dead
and
that
she
was
left
penniless
she
was
not
capable
of
any
more
tears
and
a
dull
apathy
crushed
down
upon
her
so
that
she
did
not
notice
that
at
the
station
john
heron
improved
the
occasion
as
he
would
have
put
it
by
distributing
tracts
to
the
and
porters
the
journey
to
london
passed
as
if
it
were
made
in
a
dream
and
wearied
in
mind
and
body
and
soul
she
found
herself
late
in
the
evening
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
heron
dreary
awaiting
her
reception
by
the
heron
family
she
had
been
told
by
her
cousin
as
they
drove
in
a
cab
through
the
depressing
streets
of
a
london
suburb
that
the
family
consisted
of
his
wife
and
a
son
and
a
daughter
that
the
son
name
was
joseph
and
the
daughter
isabel
that
joseph
was
a
clerk
in
the
city
and
that
isabel
was
about
the
same
age
as
ida
we
are
a
very
quiet
family
heron
had
said
and
you
will
no
doubt
miss
the
space
and
grandeur
of
heron
hall
but
i
trust
we
are
contented
and
happy
and
that
though
our
means
are
limited
our
sphere
of
usefulness
is
wider
than
that
of
some
wealthier
people
my
wife
is
unfortunately
an
invalid
and
requires
constant
care
and
attention
but
i
have
no
doubt
she
will
find
strength
to
bear
any
fresh
burden
which
providence
may
see
fit
to
put
upon
her
though
our
circumstances
are
comfortable
we
are
not
surrounded
by
the
luxuries
which
so
often
prove
a
to
weaker
brethren
i
trust
you
may
be
happy
in
our
humble
home
and
that
you
may
find
some
opportunity
of
usefulness
in
this
new
state
of
life
to
which
you
are
called
ida
tried
to
remember
all
this
as
she
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
and
looked
round
upon
the
modern
but
heavy
and
ugly
objects
with
which
it
was
furnished
the
room
was
seedy
and
shabby
but
with
a
different
seediness
and
shabbiness
from
that
of
heron
hall
for
there
was
an
attempt
to
conceal
its
loss
of
freshness
with
antimacassars
large
in
size
and
hideous
of
pattern
a
grim
and
ugly
portrait
of
john
heron
occupied
a
great
portion
of
one
of
the
walls
and
was
confronted
by
a
portrait
of
a
similar
size
of
his
wife
a
woman
of
faded
aspect
and
languishing
expression
the
other
pictures
were
of
the
type
that
one
usually
sees
in
such
houses
engravings
printed
from
wornout
plates
and
lithographs
there
was
a
large
sofa
covered
with
dirty
cretonne
and
with
a
hollow
in
the
middle
showing
that
the
spring
had
gone
the
was
adorned
by
several
religious
books
arranged
at
regular
intervals
a
cage
containing
a
canary
hung
between
the
curtains
in
the
window
and
the
bird
a
animal
it
was
moulting
woke
up
at
their
entrance
and
shrilled
in
the
hateful
manner
peculiar
to
canaries
this
depressing
room
was
lit
by
one
which
only
permitted
ida
to
take
in
all
that
had
been
described
but
vaguely
and
dimly
she
looked
round
aghast
and
with
a
sinking
of
the
heart
she
had
never
been
in
any
room
like
this
before
and
its
lack
of
comfort
its
vulgarity
struck
upon
her
strained
nerves
like
a
loud
discordant
note
in
music
but
its
owner
looked
round
complacently
and
turned
the
gas
a
little
higher
as
he
said
i
will
go
and
fetch
your
cousin
wo
you
sit
down
as
he
spoke
the
door
opened
and
the
original
of
the
portrait
on
the
wall
entered
followed
by
her
daughter
isabel
ida
rose
from
the
bumpy
sofa
and
saw
a
thin
woman
more
faded
even
than
the
portrait
and
a
tall
and
rather
a
girl
whose
face
and
figure
resembled
in
a
vague
indefinite
way
those
of
both
her
father
and
mother
but
though
she
was
not
there
was
a
touch
of
vulgarity
in
her
widely
opened
eyes
with
a
curious
stare
for
the
newcomer
and
in
her
rather
coarse
mouth
which
appalled
and
repelled
poor
ida
and
she
stood
looking
from
one
to
the
other
trying
to
keep
her
surprise
and
wonder
and
disapproval
from
revealing
themselves
through
her
eyes
she
did
not
know
that
these
two
ladies
being
the
wife
and
daughter
of
a
professional
man
considered
themselves
very
much
the
superior
of
their
friends
and
neighbours
who
were
mostly
retired
or
something
in
the
city
and
that
heron
was
extremely
proud
of
her
husband
connection
with
the
herons
of
herondale
and
was
firmly
convinced
that
she
and
her
family
possessed
all
the
taste
and
refinement
which
belong
to
the
aristocracy
a
simpler
and
a
homelier
woman
would
have
put
her
arm
round
the
neck
and
drawn
her
towards
her
with
a
few
loving
words
of
greeting
and
welcome
but
heron
only
extended
a
hand
held
at
the
latest
fashionable
angle
and
murmured
in
a
languid
and
lackadaisical
voice
so
you
have
come
at
last
my
dear
miss
heron
your
train
must
have
been
very
late
john
we
have
been
expecting
you
for
the
last
hour
and
i
am
afraid
the
dinner
is
quite
spoilt
but
anyway
i
am
glad
to
see
you
thank
you
said
poor
ida
it
was
isabel
turn
and
she
now
came
forward
with
a
smile
that
extended
her
mouth
from
ear
to
ear
and
in
a
gushing
manner
said
in
staccato
sentences
yes
we
are
so
glad
to
see
you
how
tired
you
must
be
one
always
feels
so
dirty
and
tumbled
after
a
long
journey
you
be
glad
of
a
wash
miss
heron
but
there
i
must
call
you
that
it
sounds
so
cold
and
formal
i
must
call
you
ida
must
i
it
sounds
such
an
name
but
i
suppose
i
shall
get
used
to
it
in
time
i
hope
so
said
poor
ida
trying
to
smile
and
speak
cheerfully
and
amiably
as
miss
isabel
rather
large
hand
enclosed
round
hers
but
she
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
an
appalling
sensation
of
strangeness
and
aloofness
and
a
lump
rose
in
her
throat
which
rendered
the
smile
and
any
further
speech
on
her
part
impossible
and
as
she
looked
from
the
simpering
lackadaisical
mother
to
the
vulgar
daughter
with
meaningless
smile
she
asked
herself
whether
she
was
really
awake
whether
this
room
was
indeed
to
be
her
future
home
and
these
strange
people
her
daily
companions
or
whether
she
was
only
asleep
and
dreaming
and
would
wake
to
find
the
honest
face
of
jessie
bending
over
her
and
to
see
the
familiar
objects
of
her
own
room
at
heron
hall
chapter
xxviii
when
ida
went
upstairs
for
the
wash
the
need
for
which
miss
isabel
had
so
kindly
informed
her
of
she
found
that
her
room
was
clean
and
fairly
comfortable
though
its
appearance
seemed
strange
after
the
huge
and
one
at
the
hall
the
furniture
was
cheap
and
unsubstantial
the
towels
were
small
and
thin
in
place
of
pictures
aggressively
illuminated
texts
scarred
the
walls
like
freshly
made
wounds
and
the
place
had
a
bare
homeless
look
which
made
ida
shudder
the
when
she
went
down
to
it
did
not
impress
her
any
more
favourably
for
here
too
the
furniture
was
new
and
shiny
with
a
sticky
kind
of
shininess
as
if
the
treacly
varnish
had
not
yet
dried
there
was
not
a
comfortable
chair
in
the
room
the
pictures
were
the
most
gruesome
ones
of
doré
and
there
was
a
text
over
the
as
aggressive
and
as
hideous
in
colouring
as
those
in
her
room
a
lukewarm
leg
of
mutton
very
underdone
was
on
the
table
the
cloth
of
which
was
by
no
means
clean
the
dishes
which
contained
quite
cold
vegetables
were
cracked
and
did
not
match
the
bread
was
of
the
commonest
kind
that
which
is
called
household
the
knives
were
badly
cleaned
and
the
plate
was
worn
off
the
forks
and
spoons
it
was
considered
inelegant
to
have
gas
in
the
therefore
a
cheap
was
in
the
centre
of
the
table
and
was
more
liberal
of
scent
than
light
the
curtains
to
the
window
were
of
that
annoying
red
which
shrieks
down
any
other
colour
near
it
they
made
ida
tired
eyes
ache
while
she
was
trying
to
eat
the
slice
of
gory
mutton
heron
and
isabel
watched
her
as
if
she
were
some
aboriginal
from
a
wild
and
distant
country
and
they
shot
glances
at
each
other
uneasy
glances
as
they
noted
the
beauty
of
the
face
and
the
grace
of
the
figure
in
its
black
dress
which
plain
as
it
was
seemed
to
make
theirs
still
more
dowdy
and
vulgar
in
the
midst
of
this
lugubrious
account
of
the
annoyances
and
worries
of
the
journey
heron
broke
off
to
ask
where
is
joseph
he
is
late
he
is
kept
at
the
office
replied
his
mother
poor
boy
i
hope
he
is
not
working
too
hard
he
has
been
kept
nearly
every
night
this
week
isabel
smiled
at
ida
for
what
reason
ida
could
not
guess
and
while
she
was
wondering
there
came
a
knock
at
the
outer
door
and
presently
joseph
entered
he
was
an
unprepossessing
young
man
with
small
eyes
and
thick
lips
over
which
it
would
have
been
wise
of
him
to
wear
a
big
moustache
but
it
was
the
fashion
in
the
city
to
be
and
joseph
considered
himself
the
pink
of
fashion
his
clothes
fitted
him
too
tightly
he
wore
cheap
neckties
and
boots
of
course
of
patent
leather
his
dark
hair
was
plastered
on
the
low
retreating
forehead
his
face
was
flushed
instead
of
being
as
one
would
expect
pale
from
overwork
ida
disliked
him
at
the
first
glance
and
disliked
him
still
more
at
the
second
as
she
caught
his
shifty
eyes
fixed
on
her
with
a
curious
and
admiring
expression
he
came
round
and
shook
hands
his
were
damp
and
cold
like
his
father
as
heron
introduced
them
and
in
a
voice
which
unpleasantly
matched
his
face
said
that
he
was
glad
to
see
her
tired
joseph
dear
murmured
his
mother
regarding
him
with
a
mixture
of
pride
and
commiseration
oh
i
worn
out
that
what
i
am
he
said
as
he
sank
into
a
chair
and
regarded
the
certainly
untempting
food
with
an
eye
of
disfavour
been
hard
at
it
all
the
evening
he
spoke
with
a
cockney
city
accent
and
was
rather
uncertain
about
his
aspirates
i
work
like
a
nigger
labour
is
prayer
remarked
his
father
as
if
he
were
enunciating
something
strikingly
original
nothing
is
accomplished
without
toil
my
dear
joseph
my
dear
joseph
regarded
his
father
with
very
much
the
same
expression
he
had
bestowed
upon
the
mutton
and
how
do
you
like
london
cousin
ida
he
asked
he
hesitated
before
the
cousin
ida
and
got
it
out
rather
defiantly
for
there
was
something
in
the
dignity
of
this
pale
refined
face
which
awed
him
it
was
perhaps
the
first
time
in
his
life
joseph
had
sat
at
the
same
table
with
a
lady
for
john
heron
had
married
beneath
him
and
for
money
and
in
retiring
from
the
bar
at
which
he
had
been
an
obvious
failure
had
sunk
down
to
the
society
of
his
wife
class
i
have
seen
so
little
of
it
replied
ida
i
have
only
passed
through
london
twice
on
my
way
from
france
to
herondale
and
from
herondale
here
joseph
was
duly
impressed
by
the
sound
of
herondale
oh
you
must
tell
me
all
about
your
old
home
he
said
with
an
air
of
overconfidence
to
conceal
his
nervousness
and
we
must
show
you
about
london
a
bit
it
a
tidy
little
place
he
grinned
with
an
air
of
knowingness
and
seemed
rather
disconcerted
that
ida
did
not
return
his
smile
shall
i
give
you
some
water
ida
said
heron
i
regret
that
i
can
not
offer
you
any
wine
we
have
no
intoxicants
in
the
house
we
are
all
total
abstainers
on
principle
the
other
members
of
the
family
looked
down
uncomfortably
and
to
ida
surprise
as
if
they
were
ashamed
thank
you
she
said
i
do
not
care
for
wine
i
am
afraid
there
are
a
great
many
things
you
will
miss
here
said
heron
we
are
a
plain
but
i
trust
godfearing
family
and
we
are
content
with
the
interest
which
springs
from
the
daily
round
the
common
task
you
will
find
no
excitements
at
laburnum
villa
ida
as
she
glanced
at
the
family
could
not
help
feeling
that
they
were
indeed
plain
but
she
made
haste
to
say
that
she
did
not
need
any
excitements
and
that
her
life
had
hitherto
been
devoid
of
them
they
seemed
to
think
that
it
was
the
proper
thing
to
sit
round
the
table
while
she
was
making
her
pretence
of
a
meal
but
when
it
was
finished
joseph
stretched
himself
out
in
what
was
erroneously
called
an
and
proceeded
to
monopolise
the
conversation
regular
busy
time
in
the
city
he
remarked
to
his
father
never
saw
such
a
hum
it
all
over
this
boom
in
south
africa
they
floating
that
new
company
i
was
telling
you
about
and
the
stock
exchange
is
half
wild
about
it
they
say
the
shares
will
run
to
a
hundred
per
cent
premium
before
the
week
out
and
if
you
got
any
money
to
spare
i
should
recommend
you
to
have
a
little
flutter
for
it
a
certainty
heron
seemed
to
prick
up
his
ears
with
an
amount
of
worldly
interest
which
scarcely
harmonised
with
his
saintly
character
what
company
is
that
he
asked
joseph
the
company
started
to
work
sir
stephen
orme
replied
joseph
thrusting
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
and
stretching
out
his
legs
still
farther
so
that
he
could
admire
his
large
clad
feet
it
about
the
biggest
thing
on
record
and
is
going
to
sweep
the
market
all
the
big
are
in
it
griffenberg
and
wirsch
and
the
beltons
they
say
sir
stephen
has
made
half
a
million
of
money
out
of
it
already
and
that
he
will
make
a
couple
of
millions
before
he
has
done
with
it
there
was
a
rumour
in
the
city
that
he
was
to
get
a
peerage
for
it
a
kind
of
national
affair
you
see
ida
was
sitting
beyond
the
radius
of
the
light
from
the
lamp
so
that
the
others
did
not
perceive
the
sudden
pallor
of
her
face
it
seemed
to
her
a
cruel
fate
that
she
could
not
escape
even
here
so
many
miles
away
from
herondale
from
the
reminder
of
the
man
she
had
loved
and
lost
the
name
struck
on
her
heart
like
a
stroke
causing
actual
physical
pain
she
sat
perfectly
still
her
hands
clasped
tightly
in
her
lap
as
the
wave
of
misery
swept
over
her
here
is
an
instance
of
toil
rewarded
said
heron
promptly
improving
the
occasion
the
labourer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
and
no
doubt
sir
stephen
orme
by
bringing
vast
tracts
under
the
beneficent
influence
of
civilisation
merits
the
approval
of
his
sovereign
and
a
substantial
reward
at
the
hands
of
his
let
us
trust
that
he
will
use
his
wealth
and
high
position
for
the
welfare
of
the
heathen
who
rage
in
the
land
which
he
has
er
collared
put
in
joseph
in
an
undertone
and
with
a
grin
added
to
the
queen
dominions
said
heron
i
will
consider
about
the
shares
i
do
not
approve
of
speculation
the
pursuit
of
mammon
but
as
i
should
use
the
money
for
charitable
purposes
i
may
on
this
occasion
better
make
up
your
mind
pretty
soon
remarked
joseph
with
a
yawn
there
a
rush
for
them
already
now
that
the
gentlemen
have
got
on
to
business
my
dear
i
think
we
had
better
retire
to
the
said
heron
with
an
attempt
at
the
grand
lady
they
returned
to
that
apartment
joseph
did
not
open
the
door
for
them
and
heron
and
isabel
at
once
started
on
a
series
of
questions
calculated
to
elicit
all
the
details
of
ida
past
life
her
father
death
and
her
present
deplorable
condition
women
can
be
much
more
merciless
than
men
in
this
kind
of
inquisition
and
ida
weary
in
mind
and
body
and
spirit
suffered
acutely
under
the
ordeal
the
two
women
did
not
intend
to
be
unkind
they
were
really
sorry
for
the
homeless
orphan
they
were
prepared
to
like
her
they
reluctantly
and
grudgingly
admired
her
beauty
and
her
grace
and
had
a
sneaking
kind
of
awe
of
her
higher
social
position
of
which
they
were
reminded
by
every
word
she
spoke
the
accent
and
that
indescribable
air
of
delicacy
and
refinement
which
indicate
good
birth
but
they
were
devoured
by
curiosity
as
to
her
mode
of
life
and
her
friends
a
curiosity
which
they
were
too
vulgar
too
inconsiderate
to
restrain
so
poor
ida
had
to
describe
the
hall
and
the
servants
and
the
way
she
managed
the
farm
and
the
way
in
which
she
rode
about
herondale
they
were
very
much
impressed
specially
so
when
she
mentioned
lord
and
lady
bannerdale
kind
offer
and
they
exchanged
glances
as
the
titles
left
ida
lips
quite
as
naturally
as
if
they
were
common
names
as
heron
afterwards
remarked
to
isabel
i
afraid
you
find
it
very
dull
here
ida
said
heron
with
a
sniff
you
wo
find
any
society
in
woodgreen
they
nearly
all
city
people
and
there
are
many
large
houses
this
is
as
large
as
most
and
john
is
very
strict
she
sighed
and
it
was
evident
to
ida
that
though
her
cousin
john
religion
might
be
some
amusement
to
him
it
was
rather
a
bugbear
and
nuisance
to
his
family
but
we
must
get
joseph
to
take
you
about
and
perhaps
you
and
isabel
might
go
to
a
or
two
but
john
must
know
anything
about
it
ida
made
haste
to
assure
them
that
she
did
not
need
any
amusement
that
she
preferred
to
be
quiet
and
that
she
hoped
her
cousin
joseph
would
not
take
any
trouble
on
her
account
at
this
point
heron
and
his
elegant
son
came
in
a
bell
was
rung
and
the
two
servants
came
up
for
family
prayers
ida
noticed
that
both
the
maids
looked
bored
and
discontented
and
that
the
parlour
maid
a
mere
bit
of
a
girl
appeared
to
be
tired
out
heron
read
a
portion
of
scripture
and
offered
up
a
long
prayer
in
a
harsh
and
rasping
voice
with
the
manner
of
a
judge
pronouncing
a
sentence
of
seven
years
and
as
the
servants
were
leaving
the
room
called
them
back
and
remarked
sternly
i
notice
in
the
housekeeping
book
that
a
larger
quantity
of
candles
than
usual
has
been
used
during
the
past
week
and
i
fear
that
there
has
been
grievous
waste
of
this
useful
article
do
not
let
it
occur
again
the
servants
went
out
suddenly
and
heron
suggested
much
to
relief
that
ida
would
no
doubt
like
to
go
to
bed
while
ida
was
brushing
her
hair
and
fighting
against
the
natural
fit
of
depression
caused
by
her
introduction
to
this
cheerful
household
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
she
admitted
heron
that
lady
was
in
a
soiled
bought
at
a
sale
and
quite
two
sizes
too
large
for
her
and
with
a
nervous
flush
she
took
from
under
this
capacious
garment
a
small
decanter
of
wine
i
thought
you
might
like
a
little
my
dear
she
said
as
ida
eyed
it
with
astonishment
of
course
we
are
all
total
abstainers
here
but
we
keep
a
little
in
the
house
for
medicinal
purposes
unknown
to
john
and
it
a
great
comfort
sometimes
when
you
tired
and
in
low
spirits
let
me
give
you
a
glass
ida
would
have
liked
to
have
accepted
it
and
was
sorry
that
her
refusal
seemed
to
disappoint
heron
who
retired
as
nervously
as
she
had
entered
a
few
minutes
afterwards
before
ida
had
got
over
her
astonishment
at
the
incident
there
came
another
knock
at
the
door
and
isabel
entered
in
a
which
was
own
sister
to
heron
i
thought
there
might
be
something
you
wanted
she
said
her
bold
eyes
wandering
over
ida
curiously
and
then
roaming
to
the
contents
of
ida
which
glittered
and
shone
on
the
what
long
hair
you
have
do
you
brush
it
every
night
i
do
mine
not
every
night
it
too
much
trouble
are
the
tops
of
all
those
things
real
silver
what
a
lot
of
money
they
must
have
cost
what
a
pretty
you
have
on
is
it
real
lace
yes
i
see
it
is
you
have
nice
things
with
an
envious
sigh
do
you
ever
have
more
colour
than
you
got
now
or
perhaps
it
because
you
tired
you
must
be
quite
knocked
up
when
i
come
to
think
of
it
she
dropped
her
voice
and
glanced
round
cautiously
would
you
like
to
have
a
little
i
got
same
in
my
room
of
course
the
rest
know
anything
about
it
father
teetotal
mad
but
i
keep
a
little
for
when
i
tired
and
down
in
the
mouth
and
when
i
run
out
i
get
some
from
joseph
room
of
course
he
is
a
total
abstainer
i
daresay
you
guessed
that
directly
you
saw
him
and
were
taken
in
by
his
at
the
office
business
ida
looked
at
her
in
amazement
and
isabel
laughed
knowingly
joseph
goes
to
the
theatre
and
plays
billiards
she
said
with
sisterly
candour
he
works
it
very
cleverly
he
artful
joseph
is
and
he
takes
father
and
mother
in
nicely
but
sometimes
i
find
a
theatre
programme
in
his
pocket
and
marks
of
chalk
on
his
coat
oh
i
do
blame
him
the
life
we
lead
in
this
house
would
make
a
cat
sick
it
like
being
on
a
nothing
happens
it
just
one
dreary
round
with
mother
always
whining
and
father
always
preaching
you
heard
what
he
said
to
the
servants
i
wonder
they
stand
it
i
should
go
out
of
my
mind
myself
if
i
did
get
a
little
amusement
going
up
to
the
shops
and
sneaking
into
a
on
the
sly
sure
i
do
know
how
you
stand
it
after
the
life
you
led
what
do
you
use
for
your
hair
it
so
soft
and
silky
i
wish
i
had
black
hair
like
yours
do
you
put
anything
on
your
hands
they
rather
brown
but
that
because
you
lived
in
the
open
air
so
much
i
suppose
i
lend
you
some
stuff
i
use
if
you
like
ida
declined
the
brandy
and
the
infallible
preparation
for
whitening
the
hands
and
not
at
all
discouraged
isabel
went
on
were
there
any
young
men
at
herondale
you
did
say
anything
about
them
but
i
thought
perhaps
you
would
like
to
tell
me
when
we
were
alone
i
suppose
there
was
someone
you
were
sorry
to
part
from
she
added
with
an
inviting
smile
ida
repressed
a
shudder
and
plied
her
brush
vigorously
so
that
her
hair
hid
the
scarlet
which
suffused
her
face
i
knew
so
few
of
the
people
she
said
as
i
told
you
my
father
and
i
led
the
most
secluded
of
lives
and
saw
scarcely
anyone
isabel
eyed
ida
sharply
and
suspiciously
oh
well
of
course
if
you
do
like
to
tell
me
she
said
with
a
little
toss
of
her
head
but
perhaps
it
too
soon
when
we
know
each
other
better
you
be
more
open
i
sure
i
shall
be
glad
of
someone
to
tell
things
to
she
sighed
and
looked
down
with
a
sentimental
air
but
ida
did
not
rise
to
the
occasion
and
with
a
sigh
of
disappointment
and
a
last
look
round
so
that
nothing
should
escape
her
isabel
took
her
departure
and
ida
was
left
in
peace
tired
as
she
was
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
get
to
sleep
the
change
in
her
life
had
come
so
suddenly
that
she
felt
confused
and
bewildered
it
had
not
needed
joseph
heron
mention
of
sir
stephen
orme
name
to
bring
stafford
to
her
mind
for
he
was
always
present
there
and
she
lay
with
eyes
and
aching
heart
repeating
to
herself
the
letter
he
had
sent
her
and
wondering
why
he
who
she
had
thought
loved
her
so
passionately
had
left
her
compared
with
this
sorrow
and
that
of
her
father
death
the
smaller
miseries
of
her
present
condition
counted
as
naught
chapter
xxix
as
isabel
had
intimated
life
at
laburnum
villa
was
not
altogether
hilarious
the
environs
of
london
are
undeniably
pretty
prettier
than
those
of
any
other
capital
in
europe
but
there
is
no
shirking
the
fact
that
the
northern
suburbs
of
our
great
metropolis
are
somewhat
grim
and
laburnum
villa
was
in
a
long
street
which
resembled
the
other
streets
as
one
tree
resembles
another
and
you
had
to
traverse
a
great
many
of
these
streets
before
you
got
into
the
open
country
that
is
away
from
the
and
stucco
villas
and
still
smaller
and
uglier
houses
which
had
been
run
up
by
the
enterprising
but
ida
would
have
been
glad
enough
to
have
gone
through
this
purgatory
to
the
paradise
of
country
lanes
which
lay
beyond
if
she
could
only
have
gone
alone
but
heron
and
isabel
never
left
her
alone
they
seemed
to
consider
it
their
duty
to
keep
her
company
and
they
could
not
understand
her
desire
for
the
open
air
much
less
her
craving
for
solitude
until
ida
arrival
isabel
had
never
taken
a
walk
for
a
walk
sake
and
for
the
life
of
her
she
could
not
comprehend
love
of
trapesing
about
the
dusty
lanes
and
over
the
commons
where
there
was
always
a
wind
isabel
declared
to
blow
her
hair
about
if
she
went
out
she
liked
to
go
up
to
london
and
saunter
about
the
hot
streets
gazing
in
at
the
shop
windows
or
staring
enviously
at
the
carriage
people
as
they
drove
by
ida
did
care
for
london
took
very
little
interest
in
the
shops
and
none
whatever
in
the
carriage
folks
she
was
always
pining
for
the
fresh
air
the
breezy
common
the
green
trees
and
on
the
occasions
when
she
could
persuade
isabel
to
a
country
ramble
she
walked
with
dreamy
eyes
that
saw
not
the
rusticity
of
woodgreen
and
whetstone
but
the
wild
dales
and
the
broad
extant
of
the
cumberland
hills
she
was
indeed
living
in
the
past
and
it
was
the
present
that
seemed
a
dream
to
her
of
course
she
missed
the
great
house
where
she
had
ruled
as
mistress
her
horses
and
her
cows
and
dogs
but
what
she
missed
more
than
all
else
was
her
freedom
of
motion
it
was
the
routine
the
dull
common
routine
of
laburnum
villa
which
irked
so
badly
neither
heron
nor
isabel
had
any
resources
in
themselves
they
had
few
friends
and
they
were
of
the
most
commonplace
not
to
say
vulgar
type
and
a
tea
at
laburnum
villa
tried
ida
almost
beyond
endurance
for
the
visitors
talked
little
else
but
scandal
and
talked
it
clumsily
most
of
isabel
time
was
spent
in
constructing
garments
by
the
aid
of
which
were
given
away
by
some
periodical
admirable
patterns
which
in
skilful
hands
no
doubt
produced
the
most
useful
results
but
isabel
was
too
stupid
to
avail
herself
of
their
valuable
aid
and
must
always
add
something
which
rendered
the
garment
and
vulgar
heron
subscribed
to
a
library
and
she
and
isabel
read
the
latest
novels
with
avidity
stuffing
them
under
the
sofa
cushion
at
the
sound
of
heron
approaching
footsteps
they
always
chose
the
worst
books
and
forgot
one
as
soon
as
they
took
up
another
ida
examined
one
and
dropped
it
with
disgust
for
it
happened
to
be
a
problem
novel
of
the
most
virulent
type
a
novel
which
was
selling
by
scores
of
thousands
and
one
which
isabel
had
recommended
to
ida
as
delicious
of
all
the
days
ida
found
sunday
the
worst
for
on
that
day
they
went
twice
to
a
little
chapel
at
which
heron
ministered
it
was
a
tin
chapel
which
by
its
construction
and
position
struck
a
chill
to
very
bones
here
heron
ranted
and
growled
to
his
heart
content
and
ida
learnt
from
his
sanctimonious
lips
that
only
a
small
portion
of
mankind
his
own
sect
to
wit
was
bound
for
heaven
and
that
the
rest
of
the
world
was
doomed
to
another
place
the
horrors
of
which
he
appeared
to
revel
in
as
she
sat
in
the
uncomfortable
pew
ida
often
wondered
whether
her
cousin
really
believed
what
he
preached
or
whether
he
was
a
hypocrite
of
the
first
water
all
this
was
very
hard
to
bear
but
a
burden
still
heavier
was
provided
for
her
in
the
conduct
of
her
cousin
joseph
on
the
evening
of
her
arrival
he
had
been
gracious
enough
to
bestow
upon
her
an
admiration
of
which
she
was
then
unconscious
but
his
admiration
grew
and
he
began
to
pay
her
what
persons
of
his
class
call
attentions
he
came
in
much
earlier
of
an
evening
than
he
did
before
and
he
sat
beside
her
and
with
his
small
eyes
fixed
on
her
pale
and
downcast
face
told
her
anecdotes
of
the
office
and
his
he
was
under
the
impression
that
he
possessed
a
voice
and
with
a
certain
amount
of
artfulness
he
got
her
to
play
his
accompaniments
bestowing
killing
looks
at
her
as
he
sang
the
maid
of
athens
or
my
pretty
june
with
a
false
note
in
every
third
bar
sometimes
he
came
home
to
lunch
explaining
to
them
that
there
was
nothing
doing
in
the
city
and
went
with
ida
and
isabel
on
one
of
their
walks
on
these
occasions
he
was
got
up
in
a
norfolk
jacket
and
knickerbockers
and
enjoyed
the
flattering
conviction
that
he
looked
like
a
country
gentleman
he
addressed
his
conversation
exclusively
to
ida
and
endeavoured
as
he
would
have
said
to
make
himself
agreeable
it
was
all
lost
upon
ida
whose
head
was
in
the
clouds
whose
mind
was
dwelling
on
the
past
but
his
mother
and
sister
noticed
it
and
heron
began
to
sniff
by
way
of
disapproval
of
his
conduct
with
a
mother
sharp
eyes
heron
understood
why
joseph
had
launched
out
into
new
suits
and
brilliant
neckties
why
he
came
home
earlier
than
was
his
wont
and
why
he
hung
about
the
girl
who
seemed
unconscious
of
his
presence
heron
began
to
feel
as
she
would
have
expressed
it
that
she
had
taken
a
viper
into
her
bosom
she
was
ambitious
for
her
only
son
and
wanted
to
see
him
married
to
one
of
the
daughters
of
a
retired
city
man
who
had
settled
in
woodgreen
ida
was
all
very
well
but
she
was
absolutely
penniless
and
not
a
good
enough
match
for
so
brilliant
and
promising
a
young
man
as
joseph
heron
began
to
regard
her
with
a
certain
amount
of
coldness
and
suspicion
but
ida
was
as
unconscious
of
the
change
in
heron
manner
as
she
was
of
the
cause
of
joseph
attention
to
her
he
was
just
an
objectionable
young
man
of
quite
a
new
and
astonishing
type
to
whom
she
was
obliged
to
listen
because
he
was
the
son
of
the
man
whose
bread
she
ate
he
had
often
invited
ida
to
accompany
him
and
isabel
to
a
but
ida
always
declined
not
only
was
her
father
death
too
recent
to
permit
of
her
going
to
the
theatre
but
she
shrank
from
all
public
places
of
amusement
when
she
had
left
herondale
it
had
been
with
the
one
desire
to
conceal
herself
and
if
possible
to
earn
her
own
living
joseph
was
very
sulky
over
her
refusal
and
isabel
informed
her
that
he
had
been
so
at
the
theatre
that
she
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
him
one
day
he
came
in
soon
after
luncheon
and
when
heron
had
left
the
room
informed
ida
and
isabel
that
he
had
got
tickets
for
a
concert
at
the
queen
hall
that
evening
it
a
sacred
concert
he
said
so
that
you
need
have
no
scruples
ida
it
a
regular
swell
affair
and
i
tell
you
i
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
hold
of
the
tickets
it
a
charity
concert
got
up
by
the
big
nobs
of
the
stock
exchange
and
there
be
no
end
of
swells
there
i
got
the
tickets
because
the
going
into
the
country
to
preach
and
while
the
cat
away
we
can
slip
out
and
enjoy
ourselves
not
that
he
object
to
a
sacred
concert
i
suppose
especially
if
he
were
allowed
to
hold
forth
during
the
intervals
he
added
with
a
sneer
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
ask
me
said
ida
but
i
think
i
would
rather
stay
at
home
i
thought
you
were
fond
of
music
joseph
remarked
beginning
to
look
sullen
we
shall
go
quite
quietly
and
no
one
need
know
anything
about
it
for
i
got
tickets
for
the
upper
circle
and
not
the
stalls
on
purpose
and
they
in
a
back
row
i
thought
you
enjoy
this
concert
and
if
you
do
go
i
shall
tear
up
the
tickets
oh
do
let
us
go
ida
pleaded
isabel
a
sacred
concert
is
as
good
as
a
theatre
but
it
will
be
a
break
in
the
monotony
besides
joseph
must
have
had
a
lot
of
trouble
to
get
the
tickets
for
i
read
in
the
paper
that
there
was
a
regular
rush
for
them
do
be
selfish
ida
and
spoil
our
enjoyment
i
wish
you
would
go
without
me
said
ida
with
a
sigh
but
ultimately
she
yielded
heron
of
course
knew
that
they
were
going
but
she
was
not
told
in
so
many
words
that
she
might
deny
all
knowledge
of
it
if
the
outing
came
to
heron
ears
and
she
watched
them
with
a
peevish
and
suspicious
expression
on
her
face
as
they
started
for
the
train
they
went
up
and
joseph
who
was
in
the
best
of
humours
and
wore
a
new
pair
of
boots
and
a
glossy
hat
to
say
nothing
of
a
dazzling
tie
enlivened
the
journey
by
whispering
facetious
remarks
on
their
to
ida
who
in
vain
leant
away
from
him
as
far
as
possible
in
her
corner
of
the
carriage
and
endeavoured
to
concentrate
her
attention
on
the
programme
but
though
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
it
and
she
could
not
entirely
shut
out
jokes
her
thoughts
were
wandering
back
to
a
certain
afternoon
when
she
had
sat
beside
the
heron
stream
and
listened
to
stafford
planning
out
their
future
he
had
been
telling
her
something
of
the
great
world
of
which
she
knew
nothing
but
into
which
he
was
going
to
take
her
hand
in
hand
as
it
were
he
was
going
to
take
her
to
the
theatres
and
the
concerts
and
the
dances
of
which
she
had
read
and
heard
but
of
which
she
knew
nothing
by
experience
now
she
was
going
to
her
first
concert
with
joseph
heron
there
was
a
larger
crowd
than
usual
outside
queen
hall
that
evening
for
the
concert
was
really
an
important
one
for
which
some
of
the
greatest
singers
had
been
engaged
in
addition
to
patti
santley
edward
lloyd
and
other
famous
professionals
some
distinguished
amateurs
were
to
perform
and
royalty
as
represented
by
the
and
amiable
prince
had
promised
to
patronise
the
affair
quite
a
swell
show
ai
it
said
joseph
as
he
pushed
his
way
into
the
crowd
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
long
line
of
carriages
setting
down
their
occupants
i
glad
you
consented
to
come
it
would
have
been
a
pity
if
you
missed
it
i
hope
we
shall
be
able
to
see
the
prince
from
our
seats
said
isabel
whose
eyes
were
more
widely
open
than
usual
and
her
mouth
half
agape
with
excitement
i
always
stuck
in
some
corner
where
i
see
them
when
the
royal
family
present
they
succeeded
in
making
their
way
into
the
hall
and
after
joseph
had
held
a
dispute
with
the
man
who
had
shown
them
into
their
place
and
who
had
muddled
the
tickets
and
their
numbers
they
settled
down
and
ida
looked
round
though
their
seats
were
in
the
third
row
she
could
see
nearly
the
whole
of
the
large
hall
and
she
found
the
sight
a
novel
and
impressive
one
her
interest
increased
as
the
admirable
band
played
the
first
number
with
the
precision
and
feeling
for
which
the
orchestra
at
the
queen
hall
is
famous
in
the
interval
between
the
selection
and
the
song
which
was
to
follow
joseph
pointed
out
some
of
the
celebrities
who
were
present
and
whom
he
recognised
by
their
portraits
in
the
illustrated
papers
regular
swell
mob
is
it
he
said
exultingly
there
is
a
seat
in
the
house
excepting
those
three
in
the
stalls
and
i
suppose
they
be
filled
up
presently
by
some
swells
or
other
they
always
come
late
are
you
glad
you
come
he
added
with
a
languishing
glance
amidst
a
storm
of
welcome
patti
came
forward
to
sing
and
ida
listening
with
rapture
almost
forgot
her
sorrow
as
she
passed
under
the
spell
of
the
magic
voice
which
has
swayed
so
many
thousands
of
hearts
during
the
cries
of
encore
and
unnoticed
by
ida
three
persons
a
lady
and
two
gentlemen
entered
the
stalls
and
with
a
good
deal
of
obsequiousness
were
shown
by
the
officials
into
the
three
vacant
seats
one
great
singer
followed
rapidly
after
another
and
ida
with
slightly
flushed
face
and
eyes
that
were
dim
with
unshed
tears
for
the
exquisite
music
thrilled
her
to
the
core
leant
back
with
her
hands
tightly
clasped
in
her
lap
her
thoughts
flying
back
to
herondale
and
those
summer
evenings
which
in
some
strange
way
every
song
recalled
she
was
unconscious
of
her
surroundings
even
of
the
objectionable
joseph
who
sat
beside
her
as
closely
as
he
could
and
she
started
slightly
as
he
whispered
those
seats
are
filled
up
now
i
wonder
who
they
are
they
look
classy
particularly
so
ida
nodded
mechanically
and
paid
no
heed
presently
joseph
who
was
one
of
those
individuals
who
can
never
sit
still
or
be
silent
for
long
at
a
theatre
or
concert
nudged
ida
and
said
look
there
is
one
of
them
standing
up
why
i
believe
it
is
he
borrowed
an
from
the
man
sitting
in
front
of
him
and
levelled
it
at
the
stalls
one
of
the
one
of
the
gentlemen
had
risen
from
his
seat
and
with
his
back
to
the
platform
was
scanning
the
house
with
a
pleasant
smile
on
his
handsome
face
yes
it
is
exclaimed
joseph
excitedly
it
sir
stephen
orme
here
take
the
glasses
and
look
at
him
that
gentleman
looking
round
the
house
the
one
standing
up
with
the
white
waistcoat
the
one
that
came
in
with
the
other
two
that
the
great
sir
stephen
himself
i
saw
him
once
in
the
city
besides
i
seen
his
portraits
everywhere
that
the
man
who
has
created
more
excitement
on
the
stock
exchange
than
any
man
in
our
time
ida
took
the
glasses
which
he
had
thrust
into
her
hand
and
held
it
to
her
eyes
but
her
hand
shook
and
for
a
moment
or
two
she
could
distinguish
nothing
then
as
the
mist
passed
away
and
her
hand
grew
steadier
so
that
she
could
see
sir
stephen
he
bent
down
and
said
something
to
the
lady
sitting
beside
him
she
looked
round
and
ida
saw
distinctly
and
for
the
first
time
though
fashionable
london
was
tolerably
familiar
with
it
now
the
beautiful
face
of
maude
falconer
with
her
heart
beating
painfully
ida
looked
at
her
noting
with
a
woman
quickness
every
detail
of
the
handsome
face
with
its
wealth
of
hair
a
presentiment
flashed
into
her
mind
and
weighed
upon
her
heart
as
she
looked
a
presentiment
which
was
quickly
verified
for
the
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
beautiful
woman
rose
and
looked
round
the
house
and
ida
saw
that
it
was
stafford
her
hand
gripped
the
tightly
for
it
was
in
danger
of
falling
she
felt
as
if
she
were
stifling
the
great
place
with
its
sea
of
faces
and
its
rings
of
electric
light
swam
before
her
eyes
and
she
felt
sick
and
giddy
it
seemed
to
her
that
stafford
was
looking
straight
at
her
that
he
could
not
fail
to
see
her
and
she
shrank
back
as
far
as
the
seat
would
allow
and
a
sigh
that
was
a
gasp
for
breath
escaped
her
lips
which
had
grown
almost
as
white
as
her
face
in
taking
the
glasses
from
her
joseph
noticed
her
pallor
what
the
matter
he
asked
do
you
feel
ill
it
beastly
hot
would
you
like
to
come
outside
no
no
she
panted
with
difficulty
it
is
the
heat
i
am
all
right
now
i
beg
of
you
not
to
move
not
to
speak
to
me
she
fought
against
the
horrible
faintness
against
the
shock
which
had
overwhelmed
her
she
bit
her
lips
to
force
the
colour
back
to
them
and
tried
to
keep
her
eyes
from
the
tall
figure
the
handsome
face
against
which
she
had
so
often
pressed
her
own
but
she
could
not
it
was
as
if
they
were
drawn
to
it
by
a
kind
of
fascination
she
saw
that
he
looked
pale
and
haggard
and
that
the
glance
with
which
he
swept
the
house
was
a
wearied
one
in
strange
contrast
to
the
smiling
complacent
and
even
triumphant
one
of
his
father
are
you
all
right
now
asked
joseph
i
wish
i
brought
a
bottle
of
will
you
come
out
and
get
something
to
drink
water
brandy
no
sure
you
all
right
did
you
see
sir
stephen
i
wonder
who
the
lady
is
beside
him
some
swell
or
other
be
bound
the
other
man
must
be
sir
stephen
son
for
he
like
him
he
almost
as
great
a
personage
as
sir
stephen
himself
you
see
his
name
amongst
those
of
people
of
the
highest
rank
in
the
fashionable
columns
in
the
newspapers
the
lady
got
beautiful
has
she
he
went
on
after
a
pause
not
that
i
admire
that
colour
myself
gone
on
black
he
glanced
insinuatingly
at
ida
when
the
interval
expired
sir
stephen
and
stafford
resumed
their
seat
and
with
a
sigh
of
relief
ida
tried
to
listen
to
the
music
but
she
could
hear
stafford
voice
through
it
and
was
obliged
to
shut
her
eyes
that
she
might
not
see
him
instinctively
and
from
description
she
knew
that
the
beautiful
girl
with
the
complexion
of
a
lily
and
the
wealth
of
hair
was
maude
falconer
why
was
she
with
sir
stephen
and
stafford
was
it
indeed
true
that
they
were
engaged
up
to
the
present
moment
she
had
cherished
a
doubt
but
now
it
seemed
impossible
to
doubt
any
longer
for
how
many
minutes
hours
years
would
she
have
to
sit
with
those
two
before
her
her
heart
racked
with
the
pangs
of
jealousy
with
the
memory
of
happier
days
with
the
ghastly
fact
that
he
had
gone
from
her
life
forever
and
that
she
was
sitting
there
a
spectator
of
his
faithlessness
every
song
seemed
to
mock
her
wretchedness
and
she
had
to
battle
with
the
mad
desire
to
spring
to
her
feet
and
cry
aloud
in
a
kind
of
dream
she
heard
the
strains
of
the
national
anthem
and
saw
stafford
rise
with
the
rest
of
the
audience
and
watched
him
as
he
drew
the
costly
cloak
round
maude
falconer
white
shoulders
in
a
dream
allowed
joseph
to
draw
her
arm
through
his
and
lead
her
down
the
crowded
staircase
into
the
open
air
splendid
concert
he
said
triumphantly
but
you
look
tired
ida
we
have
a
cab
to
the
station
but
let
wait
a
minute
and
see
the
prince
come
out
they
stood
in
the
crowd
which
had
formed
to
stare
at
his
royal
highness
and
as
luck
would
have
it
stafford
with
maude
falconer
on
his
arm
and
followed
by
sir
stephen
passed
in
front
of
them
and
so
close
that
ida
shrank
back
in
terror
lest
stafford
should
see
her
some
of
the
crowd
some
stock
exchange
people
probably
recognised
sir
stephen
and
spoke
his
name
aloud
and
a
cheer
arose
he
bowed
and
smiled
and
shook
his
head
in
a
deprecatory
way
and
ida
saw
face
darken
with
a
frown
as
if
he
were
ashamed
of
the
publicity
as
he
hurried
maude
falconer
to
the
carriage
a
moment
or
two
after
the
prince
appeared
there
was
an
excited
and
enthusiastic
burst
of
cheering
and
at
last
joseph
forced
his
way
out
of
the
crowd
and
found
a
cab
they
had
some
little
time
to
wait
for
the
train
and
joseph
after
vainly
pressing
some
refreshment
on
ida
went
into
the
and
got
a
drink
for
himself
and
a
cup
of
coffee
for
isabel
while
ida
sank
back
into
a
corner
of
the
carriage
and
waited
for
them
joseph
talked
during
the
whole
of
the
journey
in
an
excited
fashion
darting
glances
every
now
and
then
from
his
small
eyes
at
the
white
face
in
the
corner
when
they
got
out
at
the
station
he
offered
ida
his
arm
and
she
took
it
the
path
was
too
narrow
to
permit
of
three
to
walk
abreast
and
joseph
sent
isabel
on
in
front
and
on
some
trivial
excuse
or
another
contrived
to
lag
some
little
distance
behind
her
every
now
and
then
he
pressed
ida
arm
more
closely
to
his
side
looking
at
her
with
sidelong
and
lingering
glances
and
at
last
he
said
in
a
kind
of
whisper
so
that
isabel
should
not
hear
i
hope
you
enjoyed
yourself
ida
and
that
you
glad
you
came
i
do
know
when
i
had
such
a
jolly
night
and
i
hope
we
may
have
many
more
of
them
of
course
you
know
why
i
so
happy
it
because
i
got
you
with
me
life
been
a
different
thing
for
me
since
you
came
to
live
with
us
but
i
dessay
you
seen
that
have
you
he
laughed
knowingly
i
have
seen
what
asked
ida
trying
to
rouse
herself
and
to
pay
attention
to
what
he
was
saying
i
say
i
suppose
you
seen
how
it
is
with
me
ida
and
why
i
am
an
haltered
being
it
is
you
who
have
done
it
it
because
i
right
down
in
love
with
you
there
i
said
it
now
i
been
going
to
say
it
for
days
past
but
somehow
though
i
dessay
you
do
mean
it
you
seem
so
cold
and
standoffish
and
quite
different
to
other
girls
when
a
man
pays
them
attention
but
i
dessay
you
understand
now
and
treat
me
differently
i
awfully
in
love
with
you
ida
and
i
see
why
we
should
be
engaged
i
getting
on
at
the
office
and
if
i
can
squeeze
some
money
out
of
the
i
shall
set
up
for
myself
of
course
there
be
a
pretty
over
this
at
home
for
they
always
wanting
me
to
marry
money
and
unfortunately
you
lost
yours
not
that
i
mind
that
mind
you
i
believe
in
following
the
dictates
of
your
and
i
know
what
my
says
and
now
what
do
say
ida
and
he
pressed
her
arm
and
looked
into
her
face
with
a
confident
smile
ida
drew
her
disengaged
hand
across
her
brow
and
frowned
as
if
she
were
trying
to
grasp
his
meaning
i
i
beg
your
pardon
joseph
she
said
i
did
quite
understand
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
you
were
asking
me
he
reddened
and
pushed
his
thick
lips
out
with
an
expression
of
resentment
well
i
like
that
he
said
uneasily
but
with
an
attempt
at
a
laugh
i
just
been
proposing
to
you
asking
you
to
be
my
wife
and
going
to
are
you
ida
drew
her
arm
from
his
and
regarded
him
with
stony
amazement
for
the
moment
she
really
thought
that
either
he
had
been
drinking
too
much
spirits
at
the
at
the
station
and
that
it
was
an
elaborate
joke
on
his
part
or
that
she
had
lost
her
senses
and
was
imagining
a
hideously
ridiculous
speech
too
absurd
and
grotesque
for
even
joseph
to
have
uttered
then
she
saw
by
his
face
that
he
was
sober
and
that
he
had
actually
proposed
to
her
and
in
a
kind
of
desperation
she
laughed
he
had
been
going
to
take
her
arm
again
but
his
hand
fell
to
his
side
and
he
looked
at
her
with
a
mixture
of
astonishment
and
indignation
with
such
an
expression
of
wounded
vanity
and
resentment
that
ida
felt
almost
forced
to
laugh
again
but
she
checked
the
desire
and
said
as
gently
and
humbly
as
she
could
i
i
beg
your
pardon
joseph
i
thought
it
was
a
a
joke
i
am
very
sorry
but
though
you
did
mean
it
as
a
jest
it
is
of
course
absurd
i
do
think
you
quite
know
what
you
were
saying
i
am
quite
sure
you
do
mean
it
oh
yes
but
i
do
he
broke
in
eagerly
and
with
a
little
air
of
relief
i
in
earnest
my
word
i
am
i
awfully
in
love
with
you
and
if
you
say
yes
i
stand
up
to
the
and
make
it
all
square
for
you
but
i
say
said
ida
rather
sternly
her
lips
setting
tightly
her
eyes
flashing
in
the
darkness
which
fortunately
for
joseph
hid
them
from
his
sight
please
do
not
speak
to
me
in
this
way
again
but
look
here
he
stammered
his
face
red
his
thick
lips
twisted
in
an
ugly
fashion
do
you
know
what
you
doing
saying
yes
she
said
more
sternly
than
before
i
think
it
is
you
who
do
not
know
what
you
are
saying
you
can
not
mean
to
insult
me
i
beg
your
pardon
joseph
i
do
not
mean
to
be
angry
to
hurt
your
feelings
i
think
you
mean
to
pay
me
a
great
honour
and
i
i
thank
you
but
i
can
not
accept
it
and
please
take
this
as
my
final
answer
and
never
never
speak
to
me
again
in
this
manner
do
you
mean
to
say
he
began
angrily
not
another
word
please
said
ida
and
she
hurried
forward
so
that
they
came
within
hearing
of
isabel
nothing
more
was
said
until
they
reached
laburnum
villa
heron
was
waiting
up
for
them
and
was
expressing
a
hope
that
they
had
enjoyed
themselves
she
had
a
woollen
shawl
round
her
shoulders
and
spoke
in
an
injured
voice
and
with
the
expression
of
a
martyr
when
she
caught
sight
of
joseph
angry
and
sullen
face
as
he
flung
himself
into
a
chair
and
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
she
stopped
short
and
looked
from
him
to
ida
and
sniffed
suspiciously
and
aggressively
oh
yes
said
joseph
with
an
ugly
sneer
and
a
scowl
at
ida
as
she
was
leaving
the
room
we
have
had
a
very
happy
time
some
of
us
a
particularly
happy
time
i
do
think
chapter
xxx
it
was
hot
at
woodgreen
but
it
was
hotter
still
in
mayfair
where
the
season
was
drawing
to
a
close
with
all
the
signs
of
a
and
exhausting
dissolution
women
were
waxing
pale
under
the
prolonged
strain
of
entertainments
which
for
the
last
week
or
two
had
been
matters
of
duty
rather
than
pleasure
and
many
a
girl
who
had
entered
the
lists
of
society
a
blushing
and
hopeful
with
perhaps
a
ducal
coronet
in
her
mind
eye
was
beginning
to
think
that
she
would
have
to
be
content
with
say
the
simpler
one
of
a
viscountess
or
even
to
wed
with
no
coronet
at
all
many
of
the
men
were
down
at
cowes
or
golfing
at
andrews
and
those
unfortunates
who
were
detained
in
attendance
at
the
house
which
continued
to
sit
like
a
broody
hen
as
howard
said
longed
and
sighed
for
the
coming
of
the
magic
of
august
before
which
date
they
assured
themselves
the
house
rise
and
so
bring
about
their
holiday
but
one
man
showed
no
sign
of
weariness
or
a
desire
for
rest
sir
stephen
step
was
light
and
buoyant
as
ever
on
the
hot
pavement
of
pall
mall
and
on
the
still
hotter
one
of
the
city
his
face
was
as
cheery
his
manner
as
gay
and
his
voice
as
bright
and
free
from
care
as
those
of
a
young
man
there
is
no
elixir
like
success
and
sir
stephen
was
drinking
deeply
of
the
delicious
draught
he
had
been
well
known
for
years
he
was
famous
now
you
could
not
open
a
newspaper
without
coming
upon
his
name
in
the
city
article
and
in
the
fashionable
intelligence
now
it
was
a
report
of
the
meeting
of
some
great
company
at
which
sir
stephen
had
presided
at
another
time
it
occurred
in
a
graphic
account
of
a
big
party
at
the
house
he
had
rented
at
grosvenor
square
it
was
a
huge
mansion
and
the
rent
ran
into
many
figures
but
as
howard
remarked
it
did
not
matter
sir
stephen
was
rich
enough
to
rent
every
house
in
the
square
sir
stephen
had
taken
over
the
army
of
servants
and
lived
in
a
state
which
was
little
short
of
princely
and
lived
alone
for
stafford
who
was
not
fond
of
a
big
house
and
still
less
fond
of
a
large
retinue
begged
permission
to
remain
at
his
own
by
no
means
but
rather
modest
rooms
it
is
not
improbable
that
he
would
have
liked
to
have
absented
himself
from
the
grand
and
lavish
entertainments
with
which
his
father
celebrated
the
success
of
his
latest
enterprise
but
it
was
not
possible
and
stafford
was
present
at
the
dinners
and
luncheons
receptions
and
concerts
which
went
on
apparently
without
a
break
at
clarendon
house
indeed
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
be
present
and
in
attendance
on
his
who
appeared
at
every
function
maude
was
now
almost
as
celebrated
as
sir
stephen
for
her
beauty
her
reputed
wealth
and
the
fact
that
she
was
engaged
to
the
son
of
sir
stephen
had
raised
her
to
an
exalted
position
in
the
fashionable
world
and
her
name
figured
in
the
newspapers
very
nearly
as
often
as
that
of
the
great
financier
she
had
stepped
from
obscurity
into
that
notoriety
for
which
we
all
of
us
have
such
a
morbid
craving
almost
in
a
single
day
and
she
queened
it
with
a
languid
grace
and
which
established
her
position
on
a
firm
basis
wherever
she
went
she
was
the
centre
and
object
of
a
small
crowd
of
courtiers
the
men
admired
her
and
the
women
envied
her
for
nowadays
most
women
would
rather
marry
wealth
than
rank
unless
the
latter
were
accompanied
by
a
long
rent
roll
and
in
these
hard
times
for
landlords
too
many
english
noblemen
have
no
rent
roll
at
all
short
or
long
excepting
his
father
stafford
went
to
very
few
houses
and
spent
most
of
his
time
when
not
in
attendance
on
maude
in
the
solitude
of
his
own
chambers
or
in
the
of
one
of
the
quietest
of
his
clubs
short
as
the
time
had
been
the
matter
of
a
few
weeks
only
since
had
parted
from
ida
he
had
greatly
changed
so
changed
that
not
seldom
the
bright
and
buoyant
and
overbright
sir
stephen
seemed
to
be
younger
than
his
son
he
was
too
busy
too
absorbed
in
the
pursuit
of
his
ambition
the
skilful
steering
of
the
enterprise
he
had
so
successfully
launched
to
notice
the
change
but
it
was
noticed
by
others
and
especially
by
howard
often
he
watched
stafford
moving
moodily
about
his
father
crowded
rooms
with
the
impassive
face
which
men
wear
when
they
have
some
secret
trouble
or
anxiety
which
they
conceal
as
the
spartan
boy
concealed
the
fox
which
was
gnawing
at
his
vitals
or
howard
came
upon
him
in
the
corner
of
a
with
an
expired
cigar
in
his
lips
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
newspaper
which
was
never
turned
by
that
unwritten
code
by
which
we
are
all
governed
nowadays
howard
could
not
obtrude
by
questioning
his
friend
and
stafford
showed
no
signs
of
making
any
voluntary
statement
or
explanation
he
suffered
in
a
silence
with
which
he
kept
at
even
his
close
friend
and
howard
pondered
and
worried
in
a
futile
attempt
to
guess
at
the
trouble
which
had
changed
stafford
from
a
man
with
an
immense
capacity
for
pleasure
to
a
moody
individual
to
whom
the
pleasures
of
life
seemed
absolutely
distasteful
one
afternoon
howard
sauntered
into
stafford
room
and
found
him
sitting
in
his
with
a
book
turned
face
downwards
on
his
knee
and
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
tiny
the
terrier
who
was
lying
coiled
up
on
a
cushion
at
his
master
feet
heard
howard
step
on
the
stairs
and
barked
sharply
for
a
moment
then
glancing
at
stafford
with
a
reassuring
air
coiled
himself
up
again
and
subsided
into
spasmodic
growls
and
whines
of
welcome
for
the
mite
was
fond
of
howard
asleep
staff
he
asked
as
with
a
kind
of
groan
at
the
heat
he
dropped
his
hat
on
the
table
and
sank
on
to
the
couch
by
jove
you
have
the
best
of
it
in
here
it
is
out
of
the
sun
at
any
rate
how
that
dog
can
lie
on
a
stuffy
cushion
i
thought
you
were
going
down
to
lady
brook
at
richmond
this
afternoon
was
it
this
afternoon
said
stafford
i
forgotten
i
sorry
but
my
father
will
be
there
and
will
look
after
maude
howard
glanced
at
the
face
as
he
helped
himself
to
a
cigarette
you
well
out
of
it
a
lady
who
would
give
a
on
such
an
afternoon
as
this
is
indeed
belle
dame
sans
mercie
good
heavens
when
i
think
of
the
suffering
the
votaries
of
fashion
undergo
in
one
season
i
no
pity
left
for
the
benighted
hindoo
women
who
sacrifice
themselves
to
juggernaut
which
reminds
me
that
there
is
a
tremendously
swagger
function
on
at
clarendon
house
tonight
there
stafford
nodded
and
refilled
and
relit
his
pipe
yes
he
said
i
had
forgotten
it
but
maude
sent
me
round
a
note
to
remind
me
of
it
and
of
course
i
must
go
i
envy
you
howard
you
can
stay
away
that
what
i
ca
do
said
howard
with
a
whimsical
smile
i
am
drawn
into
the
vortex
i
am
dragged
at
the
chariot
wheels
of
that
wonderful
father
of
yours
i
am
the
victim
of
a
peculiar
kind
of
fascination
which
is
as
irresistible
as
the
mesmeric
influence
or
hypnotism
i
feel
towards
sir
stephen
as
i
should
feel
towards
napoleon
the
great
if
he
were
alive
i
follow
and
gaze
at
him
so
to
speak
with
my
mouth
agape
and
a
fatuous
smile
over
a
countenance
which
i
once
flattered
myself
was
intelligent
i
am
dazed
bewildered
by
his
genius
his
audacity
his
marvellous
courage
and
resource
do
you
know
stafford
i
think
it
would
be
an
excellent
idea
to
abolish
the
house
of
lords
the
house
of
commons
the
monarchical
government
and
place
the
whole
business
in
the
hands
of
a
board
to
be
presided
over
by
sir
stephen
stafford
drew
at
his
pipe
grimly
and
said
nothing
and
howard
went
on
in
the
gentle
monotone
characteristic
of
him
by
the
way
the
mysterious
and
proverbial
little
bird
has
whispered
to
me
that
sir
stephen
will
not
be
sir
stephen
much
longer
in
fact
that
they
are
going
to
make
a
peer
of
him
very
shortly
and
upon
my
word
they
could
find
a
better
man
for
the
place
for
unlike
some
noble
lords
you
and
i
could
mention
staff
he
will
wear
his
robes
and
coronet
do
they
ever
wear
them
now
right
nobly
and
for
once
the
house
of
lords
will
get
a
man
who
knows
his
own
mind
knows
what
he
wants
and
the
way
to
get
it
and
if
you
wo
take
offence
staff
and
throw
things
at
me
i
should
like
to
remark
that
his
son
will
prove
a
worthy
successor
can
you
fancy
yourself
in
a
peer
robe
with
a
coronet
staff
stafford
grunted
for
reply
and
there
was
silence
for
a
minute
during
which
howard
turned
over
the
pages
of
one
of
the
illustrated
weeklies
which
lay
on
the
table
and
suddenly
he
looked
up
and
exclaimed
have
you
seen
this
stafford
shook
his
head
i
mean
this
portrait
of
miss
falconer
said
howard
in
a
low
voice
it
is
wonderfully
good
he
went
on
as
he
contemplated
the
picture
wonderfully
like
her
he
handed
the
paper
across
and
stafford
looked
at
it
it
was
an
admirable
reproduction
of
a
photograph
of
maude
in
and
made
a
truly
splendid
picture
and
looking
at
it
one
felt
instantly
how
well
a
coronet
even
a
ducal
one
would
fit
those
level
brows
beneath
which
the
eyes
looked
out
upon
the
world
with
a
scarcely
masked
and
disdain
a
man
might
well
be
proud
of
such
a
woman
for
his
future
wife
but
there
was
no
pride
in
stafford
face
as
his
eyes
dwelt
moodily
on
the
almost
perfect
face
the
tall
figure
in
its
robe
the
splendour
of
her
beauty
oppressed
him
with
a
sense
of
shame
and
with
an
involuntary
exclamation
which
sounded
something
like
a
groan
he
let
the
paper
slip
from
his
hand
and
drooped
still
lower
in
his
chair
the
sight
of
him
was
more
than
howard
could
bear
in
silence
and
he
rose
and
laid
a
hand
upon
shoulder
what
wrong
old
man
he
enquired
in
a
very
low
voice
you
are
out
of
sorts
you
been
off
colour
for
some
time
past
of
course
noticed
it
i
seen
the
look
you
wear
on
your
face
now
come
over
it
at
moments
when
you
ought
to
have
been
at
your
best
and
brightest
seen
a
look
in
your
eyes
when
your
lips
have
been
smiling
that
has
made
me
uncomfortable
in
short
staff
you
are
getting
on
my
nerves
and
although
i
know
it
like
my
cheek
to
mention
the
matter
and
that
you
probably
curse
my
impudence
i
really
should
be
grateful
if
you
tell
me
what
ails
you
still
more
grateful
of
you
let
me
help
you
to
get
rid
of
it
i
know
i
an
interfering
idiot
but
i
fool
enough
to
be
fond
of
you
it
about
the
only
weakness
i
got
and
i
am
ashamed
of
it
but
there
it
is
he
laughed
with
a
touch
of
with
an
attempt
at
his
old
cynicism
but
stafford
understood
the
fictitious
character
of
the
laugh
and
as
he
leant
his
chin
in
his
hand
he
gave
a
short
nod
of
acknowledgment
howard
do
you
remember
that
time
when
you
and
i
were
at
palmero
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
as
if
he
were
communing
with
himself
rather
than
answering
his
friend
do
you
remember
that
italian
we
met
there
the
man
who
seemed
so
gay
and
careless
the
man
who
seemed
to
have
everything
a
fellow
could
desire
and
to
be
the
embodiment
of
prosperity
and
success
do
you
remember
how
once
or
twice
you
and
i
saw
a
strange
look
on
his
face
perhaps
while
he
was
at
dinner
or
fooling
with
the
women
in
the
a
look
as
if
he
had
suddenly
remembered
something
as
if
something
had
flashed
upon
his
mind
in
the
midst
of
the
laughter
and
music
and
brought
him
face
to
face
with
hell
you
pointed
him
out
to
me
one
night
and
we
wondered
what
was
the
matter
with
him
until
he
fell
off
his
horse
that
day
you
and
i
were
riding
with
him
do
you
remember
how
when
we
had
unbuttoned
his
we
found
the
that
had
been
branded
on
his
chest
we
knew
then
what
was
the
matter
with
him
he
had
been
a
deserter
the
pain
of
hot
iron
had
died
out
long
ago
but
the
scar
remained
he
was
no
longer
a
common
soldier
but
rich
and
prosperous
a
social
success
with
perhaps
his
ambition
gratified
but
the
was
there
all
the
time
and
every
now
and
then
even
while
he
was
enjoying
himself
he
could
feel
the
hot
iron
burning
into
his
flesh
and
he
knew
within
the
miserable
little
soul
of
him
that
he
was
a
cur
and
a
coward
that
driven
by
fate
perhaps
by
some
devilish
accident
of
circumstance
he
had
lost
his
honour
and
sold
himself
to
the
devil
howard
face
went
pale
and
grave
i
do
see
where
the
application
comes
in
staff
he
said
i
see
that
anything
in
your
case
position
resembles
that
poor
wretch
stafford
rose
his
face
grim
and
stern
no
and
i
ca
show
you
howard
he
said
do
you
think
that
poor
devil
would
have
bared
his
breast
and
shown
that
to
even
his
dearest
friend
good
god
man
why
do
you
badger
me
am
i
to
wear
the
cap
and
bells
always
do
you
expect
me
to
be
dancing
like
a
clown
every
moment
of
the
day
do
i
not
play
my
part
as
well
as
i
can
who
gave
you
the
right
to
peer
and
pry
he
recovered
suddenly
from
the
fit
of
fury
and
gripped
howard
arm
as
he
almost
shrank
back
from
the
burst
of
despairing
rage
forgive
me
old
man
i
did
mean
to
turn
and
rend
you
like
this
i
know
you
see
there
is
something
wrong
there
is
but
i
ca
tell
you
or
any
other
man
there
are
some
things
that
have
to
be
borne
in
silence
some
marks
of
the
which
one
dare
not
show
to
even
one
dearest
friend
howard
turned
aside
and
began
to
put
on
his
gloves
with
great
care
his
hand
shook
and
his
voice
also
slightly
as
without
raising
his
head
he
said
sure
there
no
help
for
it
staff
sure
and
certain
responded
stafford
not
even
your
wit
and
wisdom
can
be
of
any
avail
i
wo
ask
you
not
to
speak
of
this
again
it
is
necessary
but
i
will
ask
you
never
by
look
or
sign
to
remind
me
of
what
i
have
just
said
to
you
it
escaped
me
unawares
but
keep
a
better
watch
on
myself
for
the
future
and
not
even
the
knowledge
of
your
sympathy
shall
lure
another
moan
out
of
me
he
made
a
gesture
with
his
hand
and
threw
his
head
back
as
if
he
were
sweeping
something
away
and
in
something
like
his
usual
voice
he
said
with
perfect
calmness
by
the
way
maude
asked
me
to
tell
you
not
to
be
late
to
come
before
the
crush
arrives
i
think
she
is
relying
on
you
to
help
her
in
some
way
or
other
howard
nodded
and
speaking
with
his
usual
drawl
said
and
call
me
early
mother
i
will
be
there
in
good
time
miss
falconer
does
me
the
great
honour
of
permitting
me
to
flatter
myself
that
i
am
sometimes
of
some
slight
service
to
her
i
imagine
it
is
something
about
the
cotillon
concerning
which
i
am
absolutely
ignorant
and
am
therefore
capable
of
offering
any
amount
of
advice
i
am
a
whale
at
giving
advice
and
my
only
consolation
is
that
no
one
is
ever
foolish
enough
to
follow
it
so
that
i
can
humour
my
little
foible
without
suffering
the
terrors
of
responsibility
my
dear
stafford
until
this
evening
tiny
what
a
selfish
little
beast
it
is
he
wo
even
raise
his
head
stafford
laughed
and
picked
up
the
dog
by
the
scruff
of
its
neck
and
it
nestled
against
him
lovingly
and
licked
his
cheek
howard
went
still
putting
on
his
gloves
and
as
he
opened
the
door
he
swore
under
his
breath
fervently
chapter
xxxi
in
obedience
to
miss
falconer
command
howard
presented
himself
at
clarendon
house
at
a
comparatively
early
hour
that
evening
there
were
some
guests
staying
in
the
house
amongst
them
lady
clansford
who
was
still
obliging
enough
to
play
the
part
of
presiding
genius
but
they
were
all
resting
or
dressing
for
the
ball
and
the
into
which
a
couple
of
superbly
liveried
footmen
showed
howard
was
empty
but
presently
he
heard
the
of
satin
and
maude
falconer
swept
in
her
beauty
the
splendour
of
her
dress
the
flashing
of
the
diamonds
in
her
hair
and
on
her
neck
and
arms
her
queenly
presence
almost
made
howard
catch
his
breath
she
came
in
with
a
languid
grace
the
air
of
which
suited
her
so
well
but
as
she
saw
that
howard
was
alone
the
languor
and
the
almost
disappeared
and
she
came
forward
and
gave
him
her
hand
and
he
saw
a
look
on
her
face
which
reminded
him
of
that
upon
the
italian
though
it
did
not
resemble
it
for
the
first
time
he
noticed
a
shade
of
anxiety
on
the
level
brow
something
like
a
pathetic
curve
in
the
perfectly
moulded
lips
and
he
fancied
that
the
gloved
hand
which
he
held
for
a
moment
quivered
is
stafford
not
with
you
she
asked
i
thought
he
was
coming
early
his
father
expected
him
no
i
came
alone
replied
howard
but
no
doubt
stafford
will
be
here
presently
she
stood
calm
and
statuesque
but
with
her
eyes
downcast
for
a
moment
then
she
raised
them
and
looked
at
him
about
this
cotillon
she
said
then
she
broke
off
do
you
know
what
is
going
to
happen
it
is
a
secret
but
but
i
feel
as
if
i
must
tell
you
though
i
am
betraying
sir
stephen
confidence
he
tells
me
everything
more
than
he
tells
even
stafford
strange
as
it
may
seem
he
he
is
fond
of
me
that
does
not
seem
strange
to
me
said
howard
with
a
little
bow
she
made
a
slight
gesture
of
impatience
it
seems
strange
to
me
she
said
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
so
few
persons
are
fond
of
me
howard
smiled
for
once
i
must
be
guilty
of
contradicting
a
lady
he
said
when
i
reflect
that
i
shall
form
one
of
a
band
of
devoted
courtiers
who
will
throng
round
you
in
the
hopeless
pangs
of
despair
she
repeated
the
gesture
of
impatience
have
you
seen
stafford
she
asked
looking
down
i
saw
him
a
few
hours
ago
he
replied
at
his
rooms
at
his
rooms
she
repeated
with
a
slight
frown
and
a
quick
glance
at
him
he
promised
to
come
to
richmond
why
did
he
not
do
so
is
he
ill
ill
said
howard
raising
his
brows
and
smiling
for
he
knew
the
meaning
of
loyalty
to
a
friend
i
never
saw
him
in
better
spirits
in
my
life
he
was
quite
hilarious
her
eyes
flashed
upon
him
keenly
but
he
met
them
with
his
slow
cynical
smile
he
must
have
been
very
different
to
what
he
usually
is
she
said
i
have
not
seen
him
laugh
since
since
we
left
bryndermere
her
lips
came
tightly
together
and
she
looked
at
him
and
then
away
from
him
howard
you
are
his
friend
his
closest
friend
i
want
you
to
tell
me
but
no
you
would
not
speak
if
you
were
on
the
rack
would
you
no
one
sees
no
one
speaks
it
is
only
i
who
always
watching
him
see
that
there
is
something
wrong
and
i
i
am
so
helpless
the
outburst
was
so
unlike
her
the
dropping
of
the
mask
of
pride
and
was
so
sudden
that
howard
was
startled
but
no
sign
of
his
emotion
revealed
itself
upon
his
placid
face
upon
which
his
serene
smile
did
not
waver
for
an
instant
i
think
you
are
availing
yourself
of
a
lady
privilege
and
indulging
in
a
fancy
miss
falconer
he
said
stafford
is
perfectly
well
and
of
course
is
perfectly
happy
how
could
he
be
otherwise
he
bent
his
head
slightly
perhaps
he
may
be
a
little
tired
alas
we
are
not
all
endowed
with
the
splendid
energy
which
the
gods
have
bestowed
on
you
and
sir
stephen
and
the
heat
is
enough
to
take
the
backbone
out
of
anyone
less
gifted
she
checked
a
sigh
as
if
she
understood
that
it
was
useless
to
appeal
to
him
and
after
a
pause
howard
said
you
have
told
me
the
great
secret
yet
she
seemed
to
wake
from
a
reverie
and
said
listlessly
it
will
not
be
a
secret
for
many
hours
sir
stephen
is
expecting
the
peerage
the
official
intimation
should
have
reached
him
by
midday
but
the
prime
minister
did
not
return
to
london
till
this
afternoon
and
the
formalities
were
not
completed
i
think
it
will
be
announced
her
eyes
shone
and
a
spot
of
colour
started
to
her
cheeks
you
are
glad
howard
said
with
a
smile
of
sympathy
that
had
something
of
mockery
in
it
for
your
worldly
cynic
is
always
amused
by
worldliness
in
others
yes
i
am
glad
but
not
for
my
own
sake
you
think
i
am
pining
for
a
coronet
i
do
not
care
it
is
for
stafford
sake
that
i
am
glad
nothing
is
too
good
for
him
no
title
too
high
do
you
think
stafford
cares
asked
howard
she
flushed
and
her
eyes
fell
before
his
no
she
said
with
a
deep
sigh
i
do
not
think
he
cares
he
seems
quite
indifferent
all
the
time
sir
stephen
and
i
have
been
working
have
you
been
working
said
howard
raising
his
eyebrows
she
laughed
a
little
wearily
indeed
yes
i
have
been
what
do
you
men
call
it
for
weeks
it
is
i
who
have
found
out
what
is
wanted
by
the
people
who
can
help
us
and
it
is
generally
always
in
fact
money
always
money
i
get
from
sir
stephen
and
my
father
and
whisper
them
to
the
lords
and
ladies
who
have
influence
in
the
political
and
clubs
and
sir
stephen
she
laughed
his
task
is
much
simpler
and
easier
than
mine
he
just
goes
down
to
his
political
club
and
subscribes
so
many
thousand
pounds
towards
the
party
expenses
the
other
night
he
gave
them
but
i
must
not
tell
the
secrets
of
the
tories
even
to
you
howard
but
it
was
a
very
large
sum
it
is
always
done
that
way
is
it
i
suppose
so
he
assented
it
must
be
for
come
to
think
of
it
a
man
is
made
a
peer
simply
because
he
brews
good
beer
and
a
great
many
of
our
peers
were
and
are
good
brewers
you
see
oh
it
all
right
it
pans
out
very
satisfactorily
as
the
miners
say
and
so
stafford
will
be
the
future
earl
of
earl
of
highcliffe
she
said
he
has
declined
anything
less
than
an
earldom
he
has
given
so
much
sir
stephen
owns
some
land
there
and
and
some
of
his
people
come
from
there
howard
laughed
i
see
been
there
since
they
came
over
with
the
conqueror
the
herald
college
will
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
a
something
with
a
kaffir
and
a
railway
in
it
she
smiled
tolerantly
you
always
make
fun
of
everything
howard
if
only
stafford
would
care
she
sighed
and
a
moment
afterwards
her
hand
went
to
her
lip
with
the
gesture
of
a
nervous
she
had
heard
stafford
voice
in
the
hall
he
came
in
and
greeted
her
gravely
and
howard
being
present
merely
took
her
hand
you
two
conspiring
as
usual
he
said
with
a
smile
with
the
smile
which
indicates
a
mind
from
which
mirth
has
been
absent
for
some
time
yes
said
howard
we
have
been
plotting
the
cotillon
and
very
properly
arranging
that
the
prize
shall
go
to
the
wisest
the
nicest
and
man
in
the
room
i
need
not
tell
you
his
name
he
spread
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
bowed
with
mock
complacency
and
now
i
will
go
and
find
sir
stephen
and
get
a
cigarette
before
the
battle
begins
when
he
had
gone
almost
before
the
door
had
closed
on
him
maude
moved
closer
to
stafford
and
with
a
mixture
of
shyness
and
eagerness
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
how
good
of
you
to
come
so
early
she
murmured
in
the
voice
which
only
a
woman
in
love
can
use
and
only
when
she
is
addressing
the
man
she
loves
you
did
not
come
to
richmond
never
mind
stafford
you
know
that
i
do
not
wish
to
hamper
or
bind
you
do
you
not
are
you
well
she
broke
off
scanning
his
face
earnestly
anxiously
quite
well
he
responded
why
do
you
ask
maude
i
thought
you
looked
tired
pale
that
you
have
looked
so
for
some
weeks
she
said
her
eyes
seeking
his
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
am
quite
well
the
hot
weather
makes
one
feel
rather
limp
i
suppose
at
any
rate
there
is
nothing
else
the
matter
with
me
but
a
fit
of
laziness
as
if
you
were
ever
lazy
she
said
with
a
smile
there
is
a
large
party
he
said
presently
she
nodded
yes
immense
the
biggest
thing
we
i
mean
sir
stephen
has
done
her
eyes
fell
for
a
moment
you
will
dance
with
me
twice
stafford
as
many
times
as
you
like
of
course
he
said
but
i
shall
not
get
so
many
opportunities
you
will
be
too
much
sought
after
as
usual
she
sighed
that
is
the
one
disadvantage
of
being
engaged
to
you
she
said
twice
then
the
second
and
the
eleventh
waltz
he
nodded
and
stood
with
the
same
absent
preoccupation
in
his
eyes
and
she
drew
a
little
closer
to
him
still
and
as
her
eyes
dwelt
on
his
face
with
love
hunger
in
them
she
whispered
you
have
not
kissed
me
yet
stafford
he
bent
and
kissed
her
and
her
lips
clung
to
his
in
that
most
awful
of
appeals
the
craving
the
prayer
from
the
soul
that
loves
to
the
soul
that
refuses
love
in
return
ah
stafford
if
if
it
were
all
over
and
we
were
away
in
the
country
somewhere
why
do
we
go
he
asked
with
absolute
indifference
to
the
social
plots
and
schemes
which
were
being
woven
round
him
she
laughed
in
a
little
while
sir
stephen
wants
a
change
he
is
looking
rather
fagged
i
not
surprised
said
stafford
it
seems
to
me
that
my
father
rests
neither
night
nor
day
ah
well
it
will
soon
be
over
perhaps
before
you
expect
she
said
smiling
mysteriously
hush
here
he
comes
you
bad
boy
you
have
spoilt
my
hair
she
herself
had
disarranged
it
as
she
pressed
against
his
breast
i
must
run
away
and
have
it
put
straight
sir
stephen
entered
a
moment
after
she
had
left
the
room
he
looked
fagged
as
she
had
said
but
his
face
lit
up
at
sight
of
stafford
ah
my
boy
he
exclaimed
holding
stafford
hand
for
a
moment
or
two
and
scanning
him
with
his
usual
expression
of
pride
and
affection
we
are
going
to
have
a
big
night
the
greatest
crush
we
have
had
did
i
hear
maude
voice
stafford
said
that
she
had
just
gone
out
sir
stephen
nodded
musingly
and
glanced
at
stafford
grave
face
i
suppose
the
will
be
over
presently
he
said
and
we
can
go
down
to
the
country
where
would
you
like
to
go
stafford
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
sir
stephen
eyed
him
rather
sadly
and
anxiously
this
indifference
of
stafford
was
quite
a
new
thing
do
mind
what
do
you
say
to
brae
wood
then
stafford
face
flushed
not
there
would
it
be
rather
hot
at
bryndermere
sir
why
not
scotland
sir
stephen
nodded
all
right
wherever
you
like
my
boy
we
still
got
some
years
of
the
glenfare
place
we
go
there
and
stafford
do
you
ever
remember
that
i
am
getting
old
stafford
laughed
and
looked
at
the
handsome
face
affectionately
and
with
the
admiration
and
pride
with
which
a
son
regards
a
father
yes
i
suppose
you
must
be
nearly
thirty
sir
sir
stephen
laughed
not
at
the
retort
seriously
staff
i
older
than
you
think
and
er
ah
well
all
mortal
do
you
think
you
could
oblige
me
in
a
little
matter
he
paused
stafford
looked
at
him
with
a
half
smile
sounds
as
if
you
wanted
to
borrow
money
sir
anything
i
can
do
sir
stephen
laughed
no
i
not
in
want
of
money
but
i
in
want
of
a
of
grandchildren
to
sit
upon
my
knee
he
laughed
again
as
if
he
were
a
little
ashamed
of
the
touch
of
sentiment
seriously
staff
is
there
any
reason
for
waiting
i
know
that
the
engagement
is
a
short
one
but
well
why
should
you
and
maude
not
be
happy
i
can
make
arrangements
he
went
on
eagerly
there
is
brae
wood
i
make
that
over
to
you
brae
wood
again
stafford
face
grew
set
and
impassive
or
there
is
that
place
i
bought
in
warwickshire
but
there
perhaps
you
and
maude
would
like
to
find
a
place
for
yourselves
very
natural
well
there
no
difficulty
come
staff
why
delay
ye
while
ye
may
you
know
why
should
the
marriage
take
place
directly
the
house
rises
and
we
leave
london
stafford
turned
away
so
that
his
father
might
not
see
the
sudden
pallor
of
his
face
i
i
speak
to
maude
sir
he
said
trying
to
make
his
tone
cheerful
if
not
enthusiastic
sir
stephen
laid
his
hand
upon
stafford
broad
shoulder
thank
you
my
boy
he
said
you
are
always
good
to
me
always
god
bless
you
staff
his
voice
was
husky
there
was
a
moisture
in
his
eyes
which
almost
made
stafford
grow
dim
then
with
a
swift
return
to
his
usual
alert
and
sanguine
manner
sir
stephen
withdrew
his
hands
and
swung
round
i
must
be
off
maude
likes
me
to
be
in
the
room
when
the
people
come
and
by
george
staff
i
find
myself
doing
what
she
likes
all
the
time
his
laugh
rang
out
as
he
hurried
with
his
brisk
step
from
the
room
he
was
there
at
his
post
when
the
guests
began
to
arrive
and
not
far
from
him
stood
maude
in
the
splendour
of
her
beauty
not
tremulous
now
as
howard
had
seen
her
but
statuesque
and
calm
and
gracious
with
a
stately
graciousness
which
was
well
suited
to
the
coronet
which
all
knew
would
some
day
glitter
on
the
hair
every
now
and
then
as
the
crowd
increased
her
eyes
would
wander
in
search
of
stafford
and
she
noticed
that
though
he
took
his
part
did
his
duty
the
listless
expression
was
still
on
his
face
and
a
pang
shot
through
her
was
it
possible
that
he
was
still
thinking
of
that
girl
at
bryndermere
she
thrust
the
thought
the
sickening
dread
from
her
and
forced
the
conventional
smile
to
her
face
she
danced
the
first
dance
with
a
popular
duke
who
stood
high
in
the
government
and
a
word
or
two
he
let
drop
sir
stephen
a
man
worthy
of
the
highest
honors
made
her
heart
beat
with
anticipatory
triumph
the
second
waltz
came
and
ah
well
with
stafford
arm
round
her
with
her
head
almost
pillowed
on
his
shoulder
she
was
happy
and
her
fears
her
vague
doubts
and
presentiments
fell
from
her
ah
that
was
good
she
said
with
a
sigh
do
not
forget
the
eleventh
dearest
take
me
to
the
prince
he
is
over
there
she
dropped
her
curtsey
to
his
royal
highness
and
stafford
left
her
with
him
as
he
made
his
way
to
the
end
of
the
room
he
saw
griffenberg
and
several
of
the
other
financiers
in
a
group
as
usual
and
they
were
talking
with
even
more
than
their
ordinary
enthusiasm
and
secretiveness
griffenberg
caught
his
arm
as
he
was
passing
heard
the
news
mr
orme
he
asked
no
what
is
it
said
stafford
griffenberg
smiled
but
rather
gravely
they
say
that
the
peerage
will
be
announced
stafford
nodded
and
griffenberg
after
a
stare
at
stafford
impassive
face
which
evinced
no
flush
of
exultation
glanced
at
the
others
curiously
seemed
about
to
add
something
then
checked
himself
and
turned
away
and
as
stafford
went
on
said
in
a
low
voice
to
wirsch
do
you
think
he
has
heard
looked
rather
glum
did
he
the
baron
shrugged
his
shoulders
do
know
he
a
shtrange
sheentleman
he
keeps
himself
to
himself
doesh
mishter
shtafford
stafford
went
on
and
at
one
of
the
anterooms
came
upon
falconer
he
was
standing
looking
on
at
the
dancing
with
a
grim
countenance
and
seemed
lost
in
thought
so
much
so
that
he
was
almost
guilty
of
a
start
when
stafford
spoke
to
him
yes
great
crowd
just
come
in
father
all
right
quite
well
thanks
said
stafford
rather
surprised
by
the
question
at
that
moment
a
servant
brought
a
foreign
cablegram
to
falconer
falconer
tore
it
open
glanced
at
it
and
went
pale
anything
the
matter
asked
stafford
falconer
looked
at
him
fixedly
and
curiously
then
with
a
shake
of
his
head
moved
away
stafford
smoked
a
cigarette
and
sauntered
back
to
the
ballroom
he
passed
the
group
of
city
men
again
and
caught
a
word
or
two
in
the
baron
gruff
voice
i
want
to
know
how
we
shtand
the
plow
will
shmash
him
but
the
rest
of
us
us
who
are
in
de
shwim
if
de
natives
have
risen
but
stafford
paid
little
heed
forgot
the
words
as
soon
as
he
had
heard
them
and
went
in
search
of
his
partner
while
he
was
dancing
he
was
aware
of
that
peculiar
stir
that
flutter
and
wave
of
excitement
which
agitates
a
crowd
when
something
momentous
is
happening
he
looked
round
and
saw
his
father
standing
in
the
centre
of
a
group
of
persons
men
and
women
who
all
seemed
excited
there
was
loud
talking
and
sudden
and
spasmodic
movements
as
fresh
auditors
to
the
restless
group
came
up
hurriedly
and
curiously
what
is
the
matter
mr
orme
asked
the
girl
with
whom
he
was
dancing
as
she
spoke
he
saw
maude
detach
herself
from
the
group
and
approach
them
stafford
forgive
me
lady
blanche
but
will
you
let
him
come
to
sir
stephen
he
has
just
heard
news
they
followed
her
and
sir
stephen
seeing
stafford
held
out
his
hand
the
old
man
was
flushed
and
his
dark
eyes
sparkled
stafford
he
said
and
his
rich
voice
shook
i
have
just
heard
they
have
just
brought
me
he
held
up
an
paper
with
the
great
red
seal
on
the
envelope
it
is
from
the
prime
minister
it
is
the
peerage
said
maude
in
a
voice
thrilling
with
restrained
triumph
stafford
shook
his
father
hand
i
congratulate
you
sir
he
said
trying
all
he
knew
to
force
congratulation
rejoicing
into
his
voice
sir
stephen
nodded
and
smiled
his
lips
were
quivering
congratulations
sir
stephen
said
a
man
coming
up
i
can
see
the
good
news
in
your
face
not
sir
stephen
lord
highcliffe
said
another
correctingly
maude
slid
her
arm
in
stafford
and
stood
her
lovely
face
flushed
her
eyes
sparkling
as
she
looked
round
and
no
title
has
been
more
honourably
gained
a
voice
said
or
will
be
more
nobly
borne
echoed
another
stafford
with
all
a
man
hatred
of
fuss
and
embarrassment
in
its
presence
drew
nearer
to
his
father
wo
you
come
and
sit
down
out
of
the
crowd
he
added
in
a
low
voice
sir
stephen
nodded
and
was
moving
away
they
made
a
kind
of
lane
for
him
when
a
servant
came
up
to
him
with
a
cablegram
on
a
salver
as
he
did
so
howard
stepped
forward
quickly
take
it
into
the
study
he
said
almost
sharply
to
the
man
then
to
stafford
he
whispered
do
let
him
open
it
it
is
bad
news
griffenberg
has
just
told
me
quick
take
it
but
before
stafford
in
his
surprise
could
take
the
cablegram
sir
stephen
had
got
it
he
stood
with
his
head
erect
the
electric
light
falling
on
his
handsome
face
the
embodiment
of
success
he
opened
the
telegram
with
the
smile
still
on
his
lips
and
read
the
thing
then
the
crowd
of
staring
shall
it
be
written
gaping
persons
saw
the
smile
fade
slowly
the
flushed
face
grow
paler
still
paler
then
livid
he
looked
up
and
round
him
as
if
he
were
searching
for
a
face
and
his
eyes
full
of
anguish
and
terror
met
stafford
stafford
my
boy
he
cried
in
accents
of
despair
stafford
sprang
to
him
father
i
am
here
he
said
for
sir
stephen
gaze
grew
vacant
as
if
he
had
been
stricken
blind
the
next
moment
he
threw
up
his
arms
and
with
a
gasp
fell
forward
stafford
caught
him
as
a
cry
of
terror
rose
from
the
crowd
which
fell
back
as
if
suddenly
awed
by
some
dreadful
presence
and
forcing
his
way
through
it
a
famous
doctor
reached
the
father
and
son
there
was
a
moment
of
awful
suspense
then
the
music
sounded
like
a
mockery
in
the
silence
all
knew
though
no
word
had
been
spoken
that
the
great
sir
stephen
pardon
the
right
honourable
the
earl
of
highcliffe
was
dead
chapter
xxxii
by
a
stroke
as
of
heaven
lightning
the
house
of
joy
was
turned
into
the
house
of
mourning
they
bore
the
dead
man
to
his
room
plain
and
simple
even
in
that
mansion
of
luxury
the
guests
departed
some
of
them
flying
as
from
a
pestilence
some
of
them
lingering
with
white
and
dazed
faces
and
hushed
whispers
and
stafford
was
left
alone
with
his
dead
for
he
had
shut
the
door
even
upon
howard
who
paced
up
and
down
outside
not
daring
to
force
his
sympathy
upon
his
beloved
friend
the
morning
papers
gave
a
full
account
of
the
grand
ball
the
announcement
of
sir
stephen
peerage
and
the
sudden
and
tragic
ending
to
a
life
which
had
been
lived
full
in
the
public
gaze
a
life
of
struggle
and
success
which
had
been
cut
down
at
the
very
moment
of
extreme
victory
they
recited
the
man
marvellous
career
and
held
it
up
to
the
admiration
and
emulation
of
his
fellow
englishmen
they
called
him
a
pioneer
one
who
had
added
to
the
empire
they
hinted
at
a
public
funeral
and
they
all
discreetly
ascribed
telling
upon
a
weak
heart
sir
stephen
precarious
condition
had
been
known
they
said
to
his
medical
adviser
who
had
for
some
time
past
tried
to
persuade
him
to
relinquish
his
arduous
and
occupations
and
to
take
repose
not
a
word
was
said
about
the
cablegram
which
had
been
delivered
to
him
a
few
moments
before
his
terribly
sudden
death
for
it
was
felt
by
all
that
nothing
should
be
allowed
to
blur
the
glory
of
such
a
successful
career
not
for
the
present
at
any
rate
there
was
no
need
for
an
inquest
the
great
physician
who
had
been
in
attendance
quite
vainly
was
prepared
to
certify
to
the
cause
of
death
and
stafford
feelings
were
spared
thus
far
someone
high
in
authority
suggested
the
idea
of
a
public
funeral
through
howard
whom
alone
stafford
saw
but
stafford
declined
the
honour
and
the
first
earl
of
highcliffe
was
carried
to
his
last
rest
as
quietly
as
circumstances
would
permit
the
press
and
the
men
of
the
city
with
whom
the
dead
man
had
worked
kept
silence
about
the
catastrophe
that
had
happened
until
after
the
funeral
then
rumours
arose
at
first
in
whispers
and
then
more
loudly
and
paragraphs
and
leaderettes
appeared
in
the
papers
hinting
at
something
wrong
in
connection
with
lord
highcliffe
last
great
scheme
and
calling
for
an
enquiry
the
morning
after
the
funeral
howard
found
stafford
sitting
in
a
darkened
room
of
the
great
house
his
head
in
his
hand
a
morning
paper
lying
open
on
the
table
before
him
he
raised
his
white
and
haggard
face
as
howard
entered
and
took
his
friend
hand
in
silence
howard
glanced
at
the
paper
and
bit
his
lip
yes
said
stafford
i
have
been
reading
this
you
have
seen
it
howard
nodded
you
know
what
it
means
i
want
you
to
tell
me
i
have
been
putting
off
the
question
day
by
day
selfishly
i
could
not
face
it
until
until
he
was
buried
but
i
can
put
it
off
no
longer
i
must
know
now
what
was
that
cablegram
which
they
brought
him
just
before
which
you
tried
to
keep
from
him
you
have
not
read
any
of
the
newspapers
asked
howard
gravely
bracing
himself
for
the
task
from
which
his
soul
shrank
stafford
shook
his
head
no
i
have
not
been
able
to
i
have
not
been
able
to
do
anything
scarcely
to
think
the
blow
came
so
suddenly
that
i
have
felt
like
a
man
in
a
dream
dazed
bewildered
if
i
have
been
able
to
think
at
all
it
is
of
his
love
for
me
his
goodness
to
me
there
never
was
such
a
father
his
voice
broke
and
he
made
a
gesture
with
his
hand
even
now
i
do
not
realise
that
he
is
gone
that
i
shall
never
see
him
again
i
was
so
fond
of
him
so
proud
of
him
why
do
you
hesitate
if
it
is
bad
news
and
i
suppose
it
is
do
you
think
i
ca
bear
it
howard
there
is
nothing
that
you
could
tell
me
that
could
move
me
or
hurt
me
fate
has
dealt
me
its
very
worst
blow
in
taking
him
from
me
and
nothing
else
can
matter
the
cablegram
this
that
the
paper
says
what
does
it
mean
howard
sat
on
the
table
so
that
he
could
lay
his
hand
with
a
loving
and
consoling
touch
on
stafford
arm
i
come
to
tell
you
staff
he
said
i
know
that
you
ought
to
know
but
it
hard
work
that
cablegram
contained
news
that
the
zulus
had
risen
and
that
for
a
time
perhaps
for
years
the
railway
scheme
was
blocked
if
not
utterly
ruined
it
was
the
one
weak
link
in
the
chain
and
your
father
was
aware
of
it
and
had
taken
what
measures
he
could
to
guard
against
the
danger
but
fate
circumstances
were
too
much
for
him
a
silly
squabble
so
silly
as
to
be
almost
childish
between
some
squatters
on
the
border
and
the
discontented
natives
upset
all
his
carefully
laid
plans
and
turned
a
gigantic
success
at
its
very
zenith
into
a
tragic
failure
stafford
leant
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
looked
steadily
at
howard
it
was
that
that
killed
him
he
said
it
meant
ruin
i
suppose
ruin
for
him
and
others
howard
nodded
yes
he
had
staked
all
upon
this
last
throw
and
the
sudden
reverse
came
at
a
moment
when
his
nerves
were
strained
to
the
utmost
when
he
was
excited
with
the
honour
and
glory
he
had
achieved
the
blow
was
too
sudden
the
revulsion
of
feeling
from
exultation
to
despair
too
swift
too
great
it
is
one
of
the
most
awful
things
of
which
i
have
ever
heard
or
read
men
are
speaking
about
it
with
bated
breath
there
is
nothing
but
pity
for
him
nothing
but
regret
at
the
stroke
of
misfortune
which
cut
him
down
in
the
moment
of
his
triumph
and
others
repeated
stafford
it
has
brought
ruin
upon
others
what
can
i
do
is
there
anything
i
can
do
i
am
so
ignorant
i
do
not
even
know
whether
i
sit
here
absolutely
penniless
or
whether
there
is
anything
left
that
i
can
give
them
falconer
and
murray
and
the
lawyer
are
in
the
library
said
howard
they
have
been
going
into
affairs
they
would
have
liked
to
have
had
you
with
them
but
i
begged
you
off
i
knew
you
would
be
of
no
use
to
them
stafford
looked
his
thanks
no
i
could
not
have
helped
them
he
said
no
one
knew
less
of
my
poor
father
affairs
than
i
no
one
is
less
capable
of
dealing
with
them
than
falconer
will
know
what
to
do
it
is
very
good
of
him
to
come
to
my
assistance
i
have
scarcely
seen
him
i
have
not
seen
anyone
but
you
and
maude
said
howard
interrogatively
no
said
stafford
his
brows
drawn
together
i
have
not
seen
her
she
has
been
ill
yes
said
howard
in
a
low
voice
she
is
prostrated
by
the
shock
poor
girl
you
will
go
to
her
as
soon
as
she
is
able
to
leave
her
room
yes
of
course
said
stafford
very
gravely
and
wearily
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
the
footman
in
his
mourning
livery
came
in
and
said
solemnly
falconer
would
like
to
know
if
you
will
see
him
my
lord
a
frown
crossed
stafford
pale
face
at
the
my
lord
it
sounded
strange
and
mockingly
in
his
ears
i
will
come
at
once
he
said
come
with
me
howard
they
went
to
the
library
and
the
three
men
who
were
sitting
there
before
a
mass
of
papers
rose
to
receive
him
falconer
with
a
face
as
if
it
were
carved
out
of
wood
murray
with
anxious
brow
the
lawyer
with
a
grave
and
solemn
countenance
and
sharp
alert
eyes
stafford
waved
them
to
their
seats
and
took
a
chair
at
the
table
and
falconer
with
a
straight
underlip
and
eyes
half
concealed
by
their
thick
lids
spoke
for
the
others
very
sorry
we
can
not
leave
you
in
peace
for
a
little
longer
lord
highcliffe
he
said
but
i
am
quite
sure
you
would
have
blamed
us
had
we
done
so
we
have
been
going
into
your
father
affairs
and
i
very
much
regret
that
we
can
not
give
you
a
favourable
report
of
them
as
you
know
the
will
which
chaffinch
he
nodded
at
the
lawyer
read
this
morning
leaves
you
everything
and
names
chaffinch
and
murray
here
executors
that
all
very
proper
and
satisfactory
as
it
goes
but
unfortunately
we
find
that
there
is
no
estate
murray
the
secretary
passed
his
hand
over
his
wrinkled
forehead
and
sighed
as
if
he
himself
had
made
away
with
the
vast
sum
of
money
and
the
lawyer
frowned
and
shuffled
the
papers
before
him
stafford
sat
with
his
hands
clasped
on
the
table
his
eyes
fixed
on
falconer
impassive
face
your
father
immense
fortune
was
wholly
embarked
in
this
last
business
continued
falconer
he
believed
in
it
and
staked
everything
on
it
a
very
large
number
of
the
shares
were
held
by
him
they
are
down
to
nothing
it
is
very
unlikely
that
they
will
recover
it
is
possible
that
they
never
may
and
if
they
should
it
would
be
too
late
for
the
shares
your
father
held
will
of
course
go
to
meet
the
claims
and
they
are
heavy
on
the
estate
i
do
know
whether
i
make
myself
understood
i
am
aware
that
you
are
not
a
business
man
stafford
inclined
his
head
my
father
debts
will
they
not
be
paid
will
there
not
be
sufficient
he
asked
in
a
dry
voice
falconer
pursed
his
lips
and
shook
his
head
i
afraid
not
in
fact
i
can
say
definitely
that
they
will
not
he
replied
in
a
hard
uncompromising
way
stafford
looked
round
the
large
superbly
furnished
room
with
its
of
ebony
and
wedgewood
its
costly
pictures
and
bronzes
and
recalled
the
villa
with
its
luxury
and
splendour
and
the
vast
sums
which
sir
stephen
had
spent
during
the
last
few
months
it
seemed
difficult
to
realise
that
the
wealth
was
all
gone
what
is
to
be
done
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
falconer
was
silent
for
a
moment
as
he
regarded
the
handsome
face
which
seemed
to
have
lost
its
aspect
of
youth
and
taken
on
the
lines
and
hollows
of
age
i
do
not
know
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
there
will
be
a
meeting
of
the
directors
of
the
south
african
company
and
others
and
some
decision
will
be
come
to
i
have
no
doubt
and
i
i
can
do
nothing
said
stafford
huskily
i
am
penniless
i
suppose
both
murray
and
chaffinch
raised
their
heads
with
an
air
of
surprise
penniless
echoed
chaffinch
certainly
not
my
lord
surely
you
know
stafford
regarded
him
gravely
it
seemed
as
if
he
himself
were
too
crushed
by
his
grief
for
surprise
know
he
said
what
is
in
i
should
know
i
do
not
understand
falconer
coughed
we
thought
you
were
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
deed
that
your
father
had
informed
you
lord
highcliffe
what
deed
asked
stafford
dully
i
am
sorry
to
appear
so
dense
but
i
have
not
the
least
idea
of
your
meaning
as
you
say
falconer
i
know
nothing
of
business
it
is
evident
that
your
father
did
not
tell
you
that
he
executed
a
deed
of
gift
in
your
favour
a
gift
of
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
said
falconer
which
deed
being
made
when
he
was
quite
solvent
can
not
be
upset
the
money
was
placed
in
trust
and
is
quite
beyond
the
reach
of
the
creditors
said
chaffinch
we
thought
you
were
aware
of
this
my
lord
stafford
shook
his
head
he
evinced
no
sign
of
relief
the
colour
did
not
rise
to
his
face
and
his
eyes
were
still
fixed
on
falconer
it
was
a
very
wise
provision
said
chaffinch
approvingly
and
distinctly
one
i
should
have
recommended
but
sir
stephen
lord
highcliffe
did
it
of
his
own
accord
he
was
a
man
and
he
was
aware
that
fortune
might
fail
him
that
it
was
necessary
he
should
place
you
my
lord
out
of
danger
i
can
well
believe
that
even
at
that
time
he
saw
the
peerage
coming
and
felt
that
you
should
be
made
secure
that
you
should
have
a
sufficient
income
to
support
the
title
it
is
not
a
tenth
a
twentieth
of
the
sum
you
would
have
inherited
but
for
this
unfortunate
accident
of
the
native
rising
and
the
collapse
of
the
south
african
company
stafford
scarcely
heard
him
he
was
thinking
of
his
father
loving
foresight
and
care
for
his
son
future
a
pang
of
bereavement
shot
through
him
very
wise
said
falconer
grimly
whatever
happens
lord
highcliffe
is
safe
high
and
dry
above
water
mark
carefully
invested
the
capital
sum
may
be
made
to
produce
an
income
of
four
thousand
or
thereabouts
not
too
much
for
an
earldom
but
ah
well
it
might
be
so
much
worse
the
servants
the
small
debts
this
house
is
there
enough
for
them
asked
stafford
after
a
pause
chaffinch
waved
his
hand
no
need
to
trouble
about
that
my
lord
there
will
be
sufficient
at
the
bank
to
pay
such
small
claims
your
lordship
will
keep
the
house
on
stafford
looked
up
with
a
sudden
energy
no
he
said
not
a
moment
longer
than
is
necessary
i
shall
return
to
my
old
rooms
there
is
no
occasion
began
chaffinch
i
need
scarcely
say
that
the
bank
will
honour
your
lordship
cheques
for
any
amount
please
get
rid
of
this
house
as
soon
as
possible
said
stafford
he
rose
as
he
spoke
you
will
remain
to
lunch
they
murmured
a
negative
and
stafford
begging
to
be
excused
left
the
room
signing
to
howard
to
follow
him
he
did
not
mean
it
but
his
manner
in
the
abstraction
of
his
grief
was
as
lordly
as
if
he
had
inherited
an
earldom
of
five
centuries
when
they
had
got
back
to
the
little
darkened
room
in
which
he
had
sat
since
his
father
death
stafford
turned
to
howard
at
what
time
and
place
is
this
meeting
howard
he
asked
at
gloucester
house
broad
street
four
stafford
nodded
and
was
lost
in
thought
for
a
moment
or
two
then
he
said
howard
will
you
send
my
horses
to
tattersall
and
the
yacht
to
the
agents
for
sale
there
is
nothing
else
i
think
i
used
to
have
some
diamond
studs
and
rings
but
i
lost
them
i
was
always
careless
great
heaven
when
i
think
of
the
money
i
have
spent
money
that
i
would
give
my
life
for
now
but
my
dear
old
chap
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
four
thousand
a
year
it
not
too
much
for
a
man
in
your
position
but
there
no
need
to
sell
your
horses
stafford
laid
his
hand
on
howard
shoulder
and
looked
into
his
eyes
and
laughed
strangely
then
his
hands
dropped
and
he
turned
away
with
a
sigh
leave
me
now
howard
he
said
i
want
to
think
to
think
he
sank
into
a
chair
when
howard
had
gone
and
tried
to
think
of
his
future
but
it
was
only
the
past
that
rose
to
his
mind
and
it
was
not
altogether
of
his
father
that
he
thought
but
of
ida
in
his
sacrifice
of
himself
he
had
sacrificed
her
and
fate
had
punished
him
for
his
forced
treachery
he
sat
with
his
head
in
his
hands
for
hours
recalling
those
eyes
and
yes
kissed
her
sweet
lips
god
what
a
bankrupt
he
was
his
father
his
sweetheart
his
wealth
all
had
been
taken
from
him
he
did
not
think
of
maude
chapter
xxxiii
at
noon
the
following
day
there
was
a
large
meeting
at
gloucester
house
there
gathered
the
beltons
baron
wirsch
griffenberg
and
the
titled
and
untitled
folk
who
had
been
concerned
in
sir
stephen
big
scheme
and
they
were
all
gloomy
and
in
a
bad
temper
for
all
of
them
had
lost
money
and
some
of
them
were
ruined
by
the
collapse
of
the
company
which
was
to
have
made
their
fortunes
they
came
before
noon
the
appointed
hour
and
talked
sometimes
in
undertones
but
not
seldom
in
loud
and
complaining
voices
by
one
and
all
the
dead
man
was
blamed
for
the
ruin
in
which
he
had
involved
them
they
had
left
the
whole
thing
in
his
hands
he
ought
to
have
foreseen
ought
to
have
taken
proper
precautions
they
had
been
well
if
not
duped
and
deceived
the
victims
of
his
criminal
sanguineness
and
carelessness
griffenberg
being
one
of
the
heaviest
losers
was
elected
to
the
chair
but
beyond
making
a
statement
which
told
them
nothing
he
could
do
little
when
he
informed
them
that
lord
highcliffe
had
died
practically
insolvent
a
murmur
arose
a
deep
guttural
murmur
which
was
something
between
a
hiss
and
a
groan
and
it
was
while
this
unpleasant
sound
was
filling
the
room
that
stafford
entered
the
groan
if
groan
it
can
be
called
died
away
and
they
all
turned
and
looked
at
his
pale
and
careworn
face
the
tall
figure
in
its
deep
mourning
dress
silenced
them
for
the
moment
griffenberg
signed
stafford
to
a
seat
beside
him
i
am
sure
we
can
tell
lord
highcliffe
that
we
are
glad
to
see
him
that
we
are
much
obliged
for
his
attendance
some
few
said
hear
hear
but
the
rest
were
silent
and
watchful
as
griffenberg
spoke
the
door
opened
again
and
ralph
falconer
entered
he
glanced
at
stafford
and
knit
his
brows
but
dropped
heavily
into
a
chair
and
sat
with
stony
face
and
lids
he
had
scarcely
taken
his
seat
when
howard
entered
in
his
quiet
fashion
and
he
went
and
stood
just
behind
stafford
i
was
just
telling
the
meeting
lord
highcliffe
that
i
was
afraid
we
were
in
a
bad
way
said
griffenberg
we
all
relied
so
completely
on
sir
stephen
i
beg
pardon
lord
highcliffe
your
father
that
we
feel
ourselves
helpless
now
er
left
in
the
lurch
the
company
is
in
great
peril
there
has
already
been
heavy
loss
and
we
fear
that
our
property
will
be
swallowed
up
ask
him
what
sir
stephen
did
with
all
his
money
cried
an
excited
shareholder
order
said
griffenberg
lord
highcliffe
is
not
here
to
answer
questions
then
what
he
here
for
retorted
another
man
whose
loss
amounted
to
a
few
hundreds
but
who
was
more
excited
and
venomous
than
those
who
had
many
thousands
at
stake
he
all
right
he
a
lord
a
pretty
lord
and
i
told
the
gentleman
he
next
to
is
his
future
and
is
rolling
in
money
order
order
called
griffenberg
but
the
man
declined
to
be
silenced
oh
it
all
very
well
to
call
but
i
a
question
to
ask
i
want
to
know
whether
it
true
that
sir
stephen
blow
highcliffe
sir
stephen
good
enough
for
me
made
over
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
to
his
son
the
young
gentleman
sitting
there
some
of
us
is
ruined
by
this
company
and
we
do
see
why
we
should
be
sheared
while
lord
highcliffe
gets
off
with
a
cool
hundred
thousand
i
ask
the
question
and
i
wait
for
an
answer
stafford
rose
his
pale
handsome
face
looking
almost
white
above
his
black
and
black
tie
sit
down
do
answer
him
said
griffenberg
it
is
quite
true
he
said
the
money
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
was
given
to
me
it
was
given
to
me
when
my
father
his
voice
broke
for
a
moment
was
in
a
position
to
give
it
was
solvent
i
said
so
did
i
yelled
the
man
who
had
put
the
question
order
order
said
griffenberg
and
i
am
informed
that
the
gift
was
legal
that
it
can
not
be
touched
of
course
it
ca
trust
sir
stephen
to
look
after
his
own
wailed
the
man
but
i
yield
it
give
it
up
said
stafford
in
the
same
level
voice
falconer
started
from
his
seat
and
laid
a
hand
on
stafford
arm
do
be
a
fool
he
whispered
in
his
thick
voice
but
stafford
did
not
heed
him
i
give
it
up
relinquish
it
he
said
in
the
same
low
clear
tones
when
my
father
his
voice
again
shook
for
a
moment
but
he
mastered
his
emotion
made
the
deed
he
thought
himself
a
rich
man
if
he
were
alive
there
was
a
pause
and
the
meeting
hung
on
his
words
he
would
entirely
agree
with
what
i
am
doing
i
give
up
the
deed
of
gift
i
relinquish
it
my
lawyers
have
made
me
the
proper
document
and
i
now
give
it
to
your
chairman
it
is
all
i
possess
if
i
had
more
i
would
give
it
to
you
my
father
was
an
honourable
man
if
he
were
here
now
he
placed
the
deed
before
griffenberg
and
sank
into
his
seat
there
was
a
moment
of
intense
silence
then
a
cheer
arose
led
by
the
very
man
who
had
put
the
question
griffenberg
sprang
to
his
feet
i
hope
you
are
satisfied
gentlemen
he
said
with
as
much
emotion
as
a
city
man
can
permit
himself
lord
highcliffe
has
behaved
like
a
gentleman
like
a
nobleman
i
can
assure
you
that
his
sacrifice
is
a
real
one
the
deed
of
gift
which
he
has
surrendered
is
a
perfectly
sound
one
and
could
not
have
been
touched
all
honour
to
him
for
his
surrender
for
his
generosity
another
cheer
arose
again
it
was
started
by
the
very
man
who
had
attacked
poor
stafford
and
before
it
had
ceased
to
ring
through
the
crowded
room
stafford
had
made
his
way
out
falconer
caught
him
by
the
arm
as
he
was
going
down
the
stairs
do
you
know
what
you
have
done
he
demanded
in
his
dry
harsh
voice
you
have
made
yourself
a
pauper
stafford
stopped
and
looked
at
him
with
a
dull
vacant
gaze
a
pauper
repeated
falconer
huskily
i
daresay
said
stafford
wearily
and
you
an
earl
said
falconer
his
face
a
red
do
you
think
they
will
have
any
pity
not
they
they
take
you
at
your
word
they
have
every
penny
how
do
you
mean
to
live
you
the
earl
of
highcliffe
stafford
passed
his
hand
across
his
brow
and
a
smile
a
grim
smile
curved
his
lips
i
do
know
he
said
the
money
was
theirs
not
mine
stuff
and
rubbish
said
falconer
you
thought
only
of
yourself
of
your
father
good
name
i
need
scarcely
tell
you
that
maude
stafford
waited
his
pale
face
set
like
a
statue
that
maude
well
you
do
expect
her
to
consider
the
engagement
binding
after
after
this
the
blood
rushed
to
stafford
face
i
understand
he
said
miss
falconer
is
free
i
resign
all
claim
to
her
at
this
moment
howard
came
out
he
had
almost
fought
his
way
from
the
crowded
room
stafford
he
cried
it
is
not
too
late
you
can
take
it
back
they
are
friendly
stafford
smiled
i
nothing
to
take
back
he
said
howard
linked
his
arm
in
his
friend
good
lord
but
it
was
splendid
but
all
the
same
stafford
have
you
considered
it
will
leave
you
practically
penniless
i
know
said
stafford
i
have
considered
let
us
go
home
they
went
home
to
stafford
room
howard
was
hot
with
the
enthusiasm
of
admiration
and
with
the
effort
to
suppress
it
for
nowadays
men
do
not
tolerate
praise
even
from
their
dearest
friend
it
seemed
to
howard
as
if
stafford
act
of
renunciation
had
brought
him
a
certain
sense
of
relief
as
if
some
portion
of
the
heavy
weight
had
been
lifted
from
his
heart
of
course
now
we
have
to
go
into
a
committee
of
ways
and
means
my
dear
staff
you
wo
mind
my
asking
you
what
you
going
to
do
i
need
not
say
that
there
is
no
need
for
any
precipitate
action
i
er
the
fact
is
staff
i
have
a
sum
of
money
lying
at
the
bank
which
absolutely
annoys
me
by
its
uselessness
the
bank
manager
has
been
bothering
me
about
it
for
some
time
past
and
it
was
such
a
nuisance
that
i
thought
of
tossing
him
whether
he
should
take
or
i
it
is
much
a
man
does
amass
a
large
fortune
by
writing
leaders
for
the
newspapers
and
articles
for
reviews
but
of
course
you
would
be
so
mean
as
to
refuse
to
borrow
what
there
is
i
very
much
afraid
that
you
suffer
by
this
absurdly
quixotic
action
of
yours
which
mind
you
though
i
admire
it
as
i
admire
the
siege
of
troy
or
the
battle
of
waterloo
is
a
piece
of
darned
foolishness
however
let
that
go
what
do
you
mean
to
do
i
do
know
yet
said
stafford
he
did
thank
howard
for
the
offer
no
thanks
were
necessary
the
thing
is
so
sudden
that
i
have
not
made
any
plans
i
suppose
there
something
i
can
do
to
earn
my
living
i
no
brains
but
i
pretty
strong
i
might
drive
a
hansom
cab
or
an
omnibus
better
men
than
i
have
done
worse
leave
me
alone
old
man
to
have
a
pipe
and
think
of
it
howard
lingered
for
an
hour
or
two
for
he
felt
that
though
stafford
had
dismissed
him
he
had
need
of
him
and
when
he
had
gone
stafford
took
his
hat
and
went
out
he
did
not
call
a
hansom
but
walked
on
regardless
of
his
route
and
lost
in
thought
something
of
the
weight
that
had
crushed
him
had
been
lifted
from
his
heart
he
was
penniless
the
future
stretched
darkly
before
him
with
a
darkness
through
which
there
appeared
no
road
or
sign
of
light
but
he
was
free
he
would
not
be
compelled
to
go
to
the
altar
there
to
perjure
himself
with
an
oath
to
love
and
cherish
one
woman
while
he
loved
another
i
am
afraid
he
did
not
feel
much
pity
for
maude
simply
because
he
did
not
realise
how
much
she
cared
for
him
he
walked
on
for
some
time
and
at
last
found
himself
somewhere
down
by
the
minories
in
that
mysterious
east
end
of
which
we
hear
so
much
and
of
which
we
know
so
little
a
little
farther
on
he
came
upon
the
river
and
he
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
watching
some
sheep
and
cattle
being
driven
on
board
an
ocean
tramp
the
sight
of
them
recalled
herondale
and
ida
and
he
was
turning
away
with
a
sigh
when
a
burly
man
with
a
large
slouch
hat
stuck
on
the
back
of
his
head
came
lurching
out
of
one
of
the
little
wooden
offices
on
the
quay
he
was
apparently
the
owner
of
the
sheep
or
in
some
way
concerned
with
them
for
he
harangued
the
drovers
in
a
flow
of
language
which
though
rich
in
profanity
was
poured
forth
in
a
pleasant
and
jovial
voice
he
had
been
drinking
unwisely
and
too
well
and
as
he
wobbled
richly
about
the
small
quay
he
happened
to
lurch
against
stafford
who
was
attempting
to
avoid
him
he
begged
stafford
pardon
profusely
and
with
such
penitence
that
stafford
in
addition
to
granting
him
the
forgiveness
he
requested
asked
him
where
the
sheep
and
cattle
were
going
to
my
little
place
salisbury
plain
seeing
the
astonishment
which
stafford
could
not
keep
out
of
his
face
the
man
laughed
and
explained
not
your
salisbury
plain
not
the
place
here
in
england
but
in
the
country
australia
he
pointed
with
his
fat
hand
downwards
right
underneath
they
prize
rams
and
bulls
i
like
to
have
the
best
and
i
paid
a
devil
of
a
long
price
for
them
but
got
enough
left
for
a
drink
if
you
come
and
have
one
stafford
declined
but
the
man
clung
on
to
his
arm
and
thinking
it
the
easiest
way
of
getting
rid
of
him
and
to
avoid
a
scene
stafford
accompanied
him
to
the
clean
and
inviting
little
public
at
the
corner
of
the
quay
and
permitted
the
man
to
order
a
glass
of
ale
for
him
the
without
receiving
any
intimation
placed
a
large
joram
of
rum
before
the
man
who
remarked
after
raising
his
glass
to
health
yes
sir
and
i
going
with
those
beasts
i
nothing
to
say
against
old
england
so
long
as
you
do
ask
me
to
live
here
i
been
here
six
weeks
and
there
only
one
thing
that
i
feel
i
want
and
get
no
miss
it
ai
rum
there
plenty
of
that
thank
god
air
air
i
suppose
the
city
gents
are
used
to
living
without
it
though
some
of
you
look
pale
enough
do
look
quite
the
thing
yourself
sir
rather
white
about
the
gills
and
not
enough
meat
on
you
ah
i
soon
alter
that
if
i
had
you
at
salisbury
plain
lord
i
should
like
to
take
out
a
whole
shipload
of
you
and
mind
i
could
do
with
a
few
and
pay
you
better
wages
than
you
get
in
the
city
of
london
and
the
life
why
you
think
yourselves
kings
with
a
horse
to
ride
and
plenty
to
eat
and
plenty
of
fun
but
there
you
ca
tell
what
it
like
unless
you
seen
it
and
if
ever
you
should
have
a
fancy
to
see
it
you
come
out
to
salisbury
plain
to
my
little
place
on
the
for
i
like
the
look
of
you
young
man
you
a
gentleman
though
i
an
idea
you
down
on
your
luck
i
ai
so
drunk
that
i
ca
see
through
a
man
eyes
and
there
trouble
in
yours
been
outrunning
the
constable
eh
and
you
not
too
proud
to
take
a
drink
with
an
honest
man
honest
though
rough
maybe
not
at
all
said
stafford
and
now
you
will
take
a
drink
with
me
or
shall
we
make
it
a
cigar
for
he
did
not
want
to
lead
the
man
any
further
on
the
road
of
inebriety
a
cigar
right
you
are
the
settler
replied
promptly
he
took
out
an
envelope
intending
to
screw
it
up
for
a
light
but
suddenly
caught
sight
of
the
address
and
with
genial
gravity
handed
the
envelope
to
stafford
there
my
name
henery
joffler
and
there
my
address
and
anybody
at
melbourne
will
tell
you
the
best
way
of
getting
there
come
when
you
like
winter
or
summer
and
you
find
henery
joffler
ready
to
receive
you
with
a
welcome
i
will
have
a
drink
he
remarked
as
if
he
had
not
partaken
of
one
for
a
calendar
month
when
stafford
left
the
little
public
house
he
held
the
envelope
in
his
hand
and
was
about
to
tear
it
up
when
he
checked
himself
and
mechanically
put
it
into
his
pocket
the
incident
if
it
had
not
actually
amused
him
had
diverted
his
mind
in
a
wholesome
manner
for
a
short
space
but
he
had
almost
forgotten
it
when
has
reached
his
rooms
the
time
had
slipped
by
him
and
it
was
now
twilight
and
as
he
was
crossing
the
room
in
the
dusk
to
ring
the
bell
for
a
light
a
woman
rose
from
his
chair
and
came
towards
him
with
hands
and
his
name
on
her
lips
maude
he
exclaimed
startled
out
of
his
then
it
flashed
upon
him
that
she
should
not
be
there
in
his
rooms
alone
and
he
looked
at
her
gravely
why
have
you
come
maude
he
said
wait
but
one
moment
and
i
will
call
a
cab
go
home
with
you
no
she
said
presently
did
you
think
i
should
not
come
stafford
i
have
been
here
for
hours
she
drew
nearer
to
him
her
eyes
so
cold
to
others
burning
like
sapphires
as
they
were
raised
to
his
did
you
think
when
i
had
heard
what
you
had
done
that
i
should
keep
away
no
i
i
am
proud
of
you
can
you
not
guess
how
proud
my
heart
is
aching
with
it
ah
but
it
was
like
you
stafford
as
she
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
of
pride
and
of
adoration
stafford
eyes
fell
before
hers
i
could
do
nothing
else
he
said
but
i
am
sorry
you
came
maude
did
falconer
tell
you
she
laughed
and
threw
back
her
head
with
a
defiant
gesture
yes
as
if
it
mattered
as
if
anyone
even
he
could
separate
us
besides
what
he
said
was
in
a
fit
of
temper
he
was
annoyed
by
your
surrendering
the
money
and
he
could
not
speak
for
me
could
not
control
me
let
me
get
a
light
said
stafford
no
matter
she
said
as
if
she
could
not
bear
him
to
leave
her
side
even
for
a
moment
stafford
dearest
you
will
not
think
of
you
will
forget
what
he
said
it
was
spoken
in
a
moment
of
irritation
oh
my
dearest
let
me
look
at
you
it
is
so
long
since
i
saw
you
so
long
so
long
how
pale
you
are
and
how
weary
looking
her
other
arm
went
round
his
neck
and
she
would
have
drawn
his
face
down
to
her
lips
but
stafford
checked
her
you
should
not
be
here
he
stammered
she
laughed
how
proud
you
are
yes
and
i
love
you
for
it
you
think
that
i
should
desert
you
as
most
women
would
do
she
laughed
again
if
you
were
a
pauper
it
is
what
your
father
called
me
he
said
gravely
she
smiled
up
into
his
gloomy
eyes
defiantly
temptingly
what
does
it
matter
i
am
rich
my
father
is
rich
stafford
winced
and
his
face
flamed
but
she
had
turned
aside
for
a
moment
and
did
not
see
the
effect
of
her
words
and
you
have
more
than
wealth
she
laughed
i
reminded
him
of
that
and
it
sobered
him
oh
believe
me
for
all
his
pretended
stoicism
my
father
values
a
title
as
keenly
as
most
men
and
at
heart
is
anxious
to
see
his
daughter
a
countess
stafford
bit
his
lip
i
will
take
you
home
now
he
said
something
in
his
voice
told
her
that
she
had
made
a
wrong
step
that
she
had
failed
with
a
cry
she
clung
to
him
more
tightly
and
drawing
back
her
head
scanned
his
face
stafford
you
you
do
mean
to
leave
me
to
throw
me
off
say
it
promise
me
she
laughed
hysterically
and
would
have
slipped
to
her
knees
at
his
feet
but
he
held
her
firmly
see
dearest
i
would
plead
to
you
pray
to
you
i
am
so
afraid
but
you
wo
do
that
you
let
anything
separate
us
hush
there
is
my
father
stafford
you
will
listen
you
will
agree
as
falconer
knocked
at
the
door
she
released
stafford
but
stood
near
him
with
her
hand
resting
on
his
arm
falconer
came
in
and
regarded
them
from
under
his
lowered
lids
i
might
have
expected
to
find
you
here
he
said
harshly
to
maude
yes
i
came
to
him
she
said
with
a
little
gesture
why
should
i
not
why
should
i
care
falconer
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
from
her
to
stafford
i
come
to
take
back
what
i
said
this
morning
he
said
in
his
dry
voice
i
was
hasty
and
your
insensate
folly
in
giving
up
the
money
upset
me
i
have
been
talking
the
matter
over
with
maude
and
we
have
agreed
to
to
continue
the
engagement
stafford
lit
a
couple
of
candles
and
the
scant
light
fell
upon
the
faces
of
the
three
the
white
one
of
the
woman
the
stern
and
set
one
of
stafford
and
the
hard
and
impassive
one
of
falconer
of
course
a
large
sum
of
money
will
have
to
be
found
and
i
must
find
it
it
will
be
settled
upon
maude
with
of
course
a
suitable
allowance
for
a
nobleman
of
your
rank
one
moment
said
stafford
very
quietly
before
you
go
any
further
i
have
to
correct
a
misapprehension
falconer
i
do
not
intend
to
use
my
title
what
exclaimed
falconer
his
face
growing
darker
i
intend
dropping
the
earldom
said
stafford
but
i
do
intend
you
should
retorted
falconer
brutally
if
i
consent
to
my
daughter
marrying
a
pauper
a
pauper
is
one
who
begs
said
poor
stafford
his
face
white
as
marble
i
have
not
yet
begged
stafford
cried
maude
then
she
swung
on
her
father
why
do
you
speak
to
him
to
like
this
stafford
you
will
yield
in
everything
in
every
way
but
this
he
said
with
the
same
ominous
quietude
if
you
are
content
to
drop
the
title
to
share
the
life
of
a
poor
and
an
ordinary
as
i
hope
to
be
he
held
out
his
hand
and
she
would
have
taken
it
clung
to
it
but
her
father
strode
between
them
and
with
a
harsh
laugh
exclaimed
you
fool
do
you
see
that
he
is
wanting
to
get
rid
of
you
that
he
is
only
too
glad
of
the
excuse
great
god
have
you
no
touch
of
womanliness
in
you
no
sense
of
shame
she
swept
him
aside
with
a
gesture
and
advancing
to
stafford
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
is
is
it
true
she
asked
hoarsely
tell
me
is
what
he
says
true
that
that
rather
than
marry
me
you
would
go
out
into
the
world
penniless
to
earn
your
living
you
answer
do
do
you
love
me
his
eyes
dropped
his
teeth
clenched
and
the
moment
of
silence
hung
heavy
in
the
room
she
turned
from
him
her
hand
going
to
her
brow
with
a
gesture
of
weariness
and
despair
let
us
go
she
said
to
her
father
he
does
not
love
me
he
never
did
i
thought
that
perhaps
in
time
in
time
the
sight
of
her
humiliation
was
more
than
stafford
could
bear
he
strode
to
her
and
laid
his
hand
on
hers
wait
maude
he
said
hoarsely
i
must
lay
the
title
aside
i
can
not
accept
your
father
money
i
must
work
as
other
and
better
men
have
done
are
doing
if
you
will
wait
until
i
have
a
home
to
offer
you
she
turned
to
him
her
face
glowing
her
eyes
flashing
i
will
go
with
you
now
now
this
moment
to
poverty
to
peril
anywhere
oh
stafford
ca
you
see
ca
you
value
the
love
i
offer
you
when
her
father
had
led
her
away
stafford
sank
into
a
chair
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
he
was
no
longer
free
the
shackles
were
upon
him
and
he
was
practically
penniless
what
should
he
do
he
got
his
pipe
and
felt
in
his
pocket
for
his
matches
as
he
did
so
he
came
upon
henery
joffler
envelope
he
looked
at
it
vacantly
for
a
moment
or
two
then
he
laughed
a
laugh
that
was
not
altogether
one
of
derision
or
amusement
chapter
xxxiv
ida
had
found
her
life
at
laburnum
villa
hard
enough
in
all
conscience
before
the
night
of
the
concert
but
it
became
still
harder
after
joseph
condescending
avowal
of
love
to
her
and
her
inevitably
scornful
refusal
she
avoided
him
as
much
as
possible
but
she
was
forced
to
meet
him
at
the
family
breakfast
a
meal
of
a
cold
and
dismal
character
generally
partaken
of
by
the
amiable
family
in
a
morose
and
gloomy
silence
or
to
an
accompaniment
of
irritable
and
nagging
personal
criticism
heron
who
suffered
from
indigestion
was
always
at
his
worst
at
breakfast
time
heron
invariably
appeared
meaner
and
more
lachrymose
isabel
more
irritable
and
dissatisfied
and
joseph
whose
bloodshot
eyes
and
swollen
lips
testified
to
the
arduous
character
of
his
late
work
at
the
office
went
through
the
pretence
of
a
meal
with
a
sullen
doggedness
which
evinced
itself
by
something
like
a
snarl
if
any
one
addressed
him
hitherto
he
had
of
course
been
particularly
not
to
say
unpleasantly
civil
to
ida
but
after
his
repulse
his
manner
became
marked
by
a
covert
insolence
which
was
intended
to
remind
her
of
her
dependent
position
and
the
fact
that
her
most
direct
means
of
escape
from
it
was
by
accepting
him
as
her
lover
this
manner
of
his
offensive
as
it
was
intended
to
be
ida
could
have
borne
with
more
or
less
equanimity
for
to
her
alas
joseph
heron
seemed
of
very
little
more
account
then
one
of
the
tradesmen
boys
she
saw
occasionally
coming
up
to
the
house
but
after
treating
her
to
it
for
a
day
or
two
in
the
hope
of
breaking
her
spirit
as
he
would
have
expressed
it
his
manner
changed
to
one
of
insinuating
familiarity
he
addressed
her
in
a
low
voice
almost
a
whisper
so
that
his
sister
and
mother
could
not
hear
and
he
smiled
and
nodded
at
her
in
a
mysterious
manner
as
if
they
were
sharing
some
secret
though
ida
did
not
know
it
it
was
meant
to
rouse
suspicions
and
it
succeeded
admirably
her
thin
narrow
face
would
flush
angrily
and
she
would
look
across
at
isabel
significantly
and
isabel
would
snigger
and
toss
her
head
as
if
she
quite
understood
ida
often
went
to
her
own
room
before
joseph
returned
at
night
but
sometimes
he
came
in
before
she
had
gone
and
he
made
a
practice
of
sitting
near
her
even
venturing
on
occasions
to
lean
over
the
back
of
her
chair
his
mother
watching
him
out
of
the
corners
of
her
eyes
and
with
her
thin
lips
drawn
down
and
although
ida
invariably
got
up
and
went
to
another
part
of
the
room
her
avoidance
of
joseph
did
not
lull
his
mother
suspicions
ida
contempt
for
the
young
man
was
too
profound
to
permit
of
such
a
sentiment
as
hatred
one
can
scarcely
hate
that
which
one
scorns
but
whenever
he
came
near
her
with
his
tobacco
and
breath
she
was
conscious
of
an
inward
shudder
which
closely
resembled
that
with
which
she
passed
through
the
reptile
house
at
the
zoological
gardens
joseph
the
house
the
whole
life
began
to
get
on
her
nerves
and
in
the
solitude
of
her
own
room
she
spent
many
an
anguished
hour
trying
to
discover
some
way
of
escape
she
read
all
the
advertisements
of
situations
vacant
in
the
newspaper
but
all
the
employers
seemed
to
require
technical
knowledge
and
accomplishments
which
she
did
not
possess
she
knew
she
could
not
teach
even
the
youngest
of
children
she
was
unacquainted
with
the
mysterious
science
of
and
had
never
seen
a
typewriter
no
one
appeared
to
want
a
young
lady
who
could
break
horses
tend
cattle
or
run
a
farm
and
this
was
the
only
kind
of
work
she
could
do
so
she
was
forced
to
the
bitter
conclusion
that
she
would
have
to
go
on
living
the
life
and
eat
the
bread
of
the
herons
with
as
much
patience
as
she
could
command
in
the
hope
that
some
day
something
would
happen
to
release
her
from
her
bondage
which
was
gradually
robbing
her
eyes
of
their
brightness
and
making
her
thin
and
listless
it
seemed
that
nothing
ever
would
happen
that
the
weeks
would
drag
into
months
and
the
months
into
years
and
one
day
as
she
toiled
slowly
home
from
a
country
walk
she
almost
felt
inclined
to
turn
to
that
last
refuge
of
the
destitute
and
answer
one
of
the
advertisements
for
a
lady
help
anything
would
be
better
than
to
go
on
living
the
life
in
death
which
was
her
lot
at
laburnum
villa
as
she
approached
the
house
she
saw
that
the
gas
was
lit
in
the
and
the
sound
of
voices
in
which
a
strange
one
mingled
penetrated
through
the
thin
door
as
she
passed
through
the
hall
to
her
room
while
she
was
taking
off
her
hat
there
came
a
hurried
knock
and
isabel
entered
in
her
best
dress
she
was
flushed
and
in
a
flatter
of
suppressed
excitement
oh
ida
can
you
lend
me
a
clean
collar
she
asked
in
a
stage
whisper
and
with
a
giggle
which
was
intended
to
invite
question
but
as
ida
had
asked
none
isabel
said
with
another
giggle
you
heard
me
speak
of
george
powler
ida
looked
doubtful
isabel
had
mentioned
so
many
men
generally
by
their
christian
names
who
were
supposed
to
be
smitten
by
her
that
ida
often
listening
absently
enough
to
the
foolish
girl
confidences
not
seldom
got
mixed
the
one
who
went
to
south
australia
isabel
went
on
with
an
affectation
of
coy
shyness
we
used
to
see
a
great
deal
of
him
at
least
he
used
to
call
before
he
went
away
and
though
there
really
was
nothing
serious
between
us
of
course
but
one
does
like
to
speak
of
these
things
even
to
one
bosom
friend
but
he
just
now
i
just
had
time
to
run
up
and
he
actually
almost
saw
me
on
the
stairs
yes
this
one
will
do
you
always
have
such
collars
and
yet
you
have
always
lived
in
the
country
i
must
be
quick
and
hurry
down
men
do
so
hate
to
be
kept
waiting
do
they
come
down
presently
wo
you
ida
i
sure
you
like
him
he
so
steady
and
it
a
very
good
business
of
course
as
i
said
nothing
definite
has
passed
between
us
but
she
giggled
and
simpered
significantly
and
ida
trying
to
force
herself
to
take
some
interest
fastened
the
collar
for
isabel
and
gently
and
with
much
tact
persuaded
that
inartistic
young
lady
to
discard
a
huge
crimson
bow
which
she
had
stuck
on
her
dress
with
disastrous
results
when
some
little
time
after
ida
went
down
to
the
she
found
that
the
visitor
was
like
most
of
those
who
came
to
laburnum
villa
very
worthy
people
no
doubt
but
uninteresting
and
commonplace
this
george
powler
was
a
heavy
man
approaching
middle
age
with
the
air
of
a
prosperous
merchant
and
with
a
somewhat
shy
and
awkward
manner
it
seemed
to
ida
that
he
looked
rather
bored
as
he
sat
on
one
of
the
stiff
uncomfortable
chairs
with
the
mother
and
daughter
engaging
him
in
conversation
as
they
would
have
called
it
his
shyness
and
awkwardness
were
intensified
by
the
entrance
of
the
tall
graceful
girl
in
her
black
dress
and
he
rose
to
receive
the
introduction
with
a
startled
kind
of
nervousness
which
was
reasonable
enough
for
the
young
women
with
whom
he
associated
were
not
dowered
with
ida
very
palpable
grace
and
refinement
ida
bowed
to
him
made
some
remark
about
the
weather
and
went
over
with
a
book
to
the
sofa
with
the
broken
spring
and
promptly
forgot
his
existence
but
her
indifference
was
not
reciprocated
the
man
was
painfully
aware
of
her
presence
and
after
endeavouring
to
carry
on
the
conversation
with
isabel
grew
and
incoherent
and
presently
as
if
he
could
not
help
himself
got
up
and
edging
to
the
sofa
nervously
sat
down
and
tried
to
talk
ida
closed
her
book
and
as
in
duty
bound
was
civil
to
him
though
not
perhaps
so
civil
as
she
would
have
been
to
a
man
of
her
own
age
and
class
but
george
powler
no
doubt
encouraged
by
her
gentleness
serenity
and
perfect
qualities
none
too
common
in
the
class
to
which
he
belonged
grew
less
nervous
and
to
his
own
amazement
found
himself
talking
presently
quite
fluently
to
this
young
lady
whose
entrance
of
the
had
struck
him
with
awe
with
instinctive
courteousness
and
kindness
ida
had
asked
him
some
question
about
south
australia
and
he
was
led
to
talk
of
his
life
there
and
to
describe
the
country
ida
found
her
thoughts
wandering
after
a
few
minutes
and
grew
but
george
powler
was
launched
on
his
favourite
subject
was
delighted
with
the
condescension
of
the
beautiful
and
stately
listener
and
did
not
notice
that
she
was
scarcely
listening
did
not
notice
also
that
heron
was
looking
discontented
and
sniffing
peevishly
and
that
isabel
face
wore
an
expression
of
jealousy
and
resentment
the
fact
was
that
the
poor
man
had
quite
forgotten
the
other
young
woman
and
the
other
young
woman
knew
it
suddenly
their
silence
bore
down
upon
ida
she
felt
rather
than
saw
that
something
was
the
matter
and
she
got
up
in
the
middle
of
one
of
george
powler
fluent
but
badly
constructed
sentences
and
going
over
to
isabel
asked
her
to
play
something
isabel
flushed
oh
you
had
better
sing
she
said
powler
would
like
that
better
sure
oh
yes
please
do
pleaded
the
man
and
ida
trying
to
conceal
her
weariness
and
distaste
went
to
the
piano
and
sang
the
shortest
song
she
knew
her
acquiescence
was
unfortunate
in
its
result
for
it
completed
in
george
powler
bosom
the
havoc
which
her
face
and
voice
had
wrought
he
pressed
her
to
sing
again
beat
time
with
his
large
hand
and
badly
groomed
head
and
was
enthusiastic
in
his
praises
and
seemed
so
disappointed
when
she
refused
that
he
seconded
her
appeal
to
isabel
with
an
obviously
forced
politeness
isabel
went
to
the
piano
but
she
was
at
no
time
a
very
brilliant
performer
and
the
poor
girl
was
so
upset
by
ida
unconscious
and
unwilling
superiority
that
she
broke
down
in
the
middle
of
one
of
those
hideous
pieces
which
seem
specially
arranged
for
the
torture
of
those
who
are
blessed
or
cursed
with
musical
taste
the
conversation
naturally
lagged
and
languished
under
these
circumstances
and
george
powler
presently
rose
to
take
his
leave
he
was
not
asked
to
remain
to
dinner
though
heron
had
intended
inviting
him
and
had
made
secret
and
flurried
preparations
he
shook
hands
with
ida
with
marked
and
nervousness
and
seemed
as
if
he
could
scarcely
tear
himself
away
when
he
had
gone
the
mother
and
daughter
sat
bolt
upright
in
their
chairs
and
stared
before
them
in
a
pregnant
silence
and
ida
wondering
what
was
the
matter
was
about
to
leave
the
room
when
heron
said
in
a
hard
thin
voice
one
moment
ida
if
you
please
ida
paused
at
the
door
with
her
book
in
her
hand
startled
from
her
dreaminess
by
the
woman
tone
and
manner
you
had
better
close
the
door
ida
i
should
not
like
the
servants
to
overhear
what
it
is
my
duty
to
say
to
you
ida
closed
the
door
and
stood
expectantly
and
heron
continued
i
trust
i
am
not
one
to
find
fault
unnecessarily
i
know
it
is
the
duty
of
a
christian
to
be
patient
and
but
there
is
a
limit
to
one
endurance
and
i
regret
to
say
that
you
have
passed
that
limit
i
should
not
be
fulfilling
my
duty
to
a
young
person
who
is
under
my
charge
if
i
refrained
from
pointing
out
to
you
that
your
conduct
since
you
have
been
under
our
roof
has
been
reprehensible
and
disgraceful
ida
was
too
amazed
for
a
moment
to
realise
the
full
significance
of
the
spiteful
speech
and
then
as
it
gradually
dawned
upon
her
the
blood
rose
to
her
face
and
an
indignant
protest
rose
to
her
lips
but
she
checked
it
and
merely
repeated
the
objectionable
phrase
yes
disgraceful
said
heron
i
am
sorry
to
be
compelled
to
use
such
a
word
to
a
young
girl
and
to
one
in
your
position
and
i
do
not
think
you
make
matters
better
by
pretending
not
to
know
what
i
mean
it
is
no
pretence
heron
said
ida
quite
calmly
i
do
not
in
the
least
know
what
you
mean
then
i
tell
you
retorted
heron
with
suppressed
fury
you
are
one
of
the
most
shameless
flirts
i
ever
knew
ida
fell
an
almost
irresistible
desire
to
laugh
she
had
been
tired
when
she
came
in
george
powler
attentions
had
made
her
still
more
weary
and
the
sight
of
the
two
women
seated
bolt
upright
and
evidently
boiling
over
with
anger
was
full
of
a
grotesque
humour
which
affected
her
hysterically
she
managed
to
stifle
the
laugh
and
looked
at
them
patiently
and
calmly
as
she
stood
by
the
with
one
arm
resting
on
the
shelf
the
unconscious
ease
and
grace
of
her
attitude
increased
heron
irritation
her
thin
lips
trembled
and
her
eyes
grew
red
oh
i
am
not
blind
she
said
i
been
quite
aware
of
your
conduct
for
some
time
past
but
i
have
refrained
from
speaking
to
you
because
as
i
say
you
are
under
my
roof
and
i
did
not
wish
to
hurt
your
feelings
though
i
am
sure
you
have
had
very
little
regard
for
ours
i
have
been
greatly
deceived
in
you
ida
i
thought
when
you
came
that
you
were
a
quiet
young
woman
and
i
could
scarcely
believe
my
eyes
when
i
first
saw
that
i
was
mistaken
and
that
your
quietness
was
only
slyness
i
suppose
you
did
think
i
saw
that
you
were
trying
to
entrap
my
poor
boy
but
a
mother
eyes
are
sharp
and
a
mother
will
protect
her
own
at
any
cost
oh
you
need
try
to
stare
me
out
of
countenance
or
to
put
on
that
surprised
and
innocent
look
you
may
have
been
able
to
deceive
me
once
but
you
ca
now
i
been
watching
you
and
i
seen
with
my
own
eyes
your
carryings
on
heron
began
ida
very
quietly
but
heron
tore
on
with
breathless
vehemence
i
suppose
you
only
did
it
for
your
amusement
i
do
suppose
you
thought
there
would
be
any
good
in
it
that
his
father
or
i
would
allow
joseph
to
make
such
a
of
himself
as
to
throw
himself
away
upon
a
girl
without
any
means
but
it
all
the
more
shameful
you
succeeded
very
well
you
turned
the
poor
boy
head
and
made
him
miserable
it
to
be
hoped
that
it
will
stop
there
and
that
he
wo
be
driven
to
drink
or
desperate
courses
as
some
young
men
are
of
course
say
that
you
never
meant
anything
of
the
kind
i
quite
prepared
for
that
you
can
be
plausible
enough
when
you
like
with
that
quiet
manner
of
yours
ida
had
passed
beyond
the
laughing
stage
by
this
time
her
face
was
pale
her
eyes
flashing
but
she
was
able
to
say
with
an
appearance
of
calm
you
are
quite
right
heron
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
i
did
not
wish
your
son
to
pay
me
any
attention
much
less
oh
do
you
not
see
how
ridiculous
it
is
she
broke
out
indignantly
and
with
a
little
desperate
laugh
heron
face
flamed
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
ridiculous
she
snapped
i
should
say
joseph
was
quite
good
enough
a
match
for
you
and
i
no
doubt
you
think
so
though
you
pretend
to
sneer
at
him
let
me
assure
you
heron
that
i
have
never
thought
of
your
son
as
a
possible
husband
said
ida
his
attentions
to
me
are
more
than
unwelcome
and
he
knows
it
oh
then
you
admit
that
the
poor
boy
is
in
love
with
you
that
he
has
told
you
you
see
you
ca
deceive
me
i
knew
it
i
wonder
you
ashamed
of
yourself
at
any
rate
having
caused
trouble
in
the
house
that
shelters
you
that
you
have
shame
enough
to
refrain
from
flirting
before
our
very
eyes
with
the
first
man
that
appears
ida
stared
at
her
in
amazement
too
great
for
the
moment
to
permit
of
resentment
what
is
this
you
accuse
me
of
she
asked
oh
pray
pray
do
not
be
so
unreasonable
so
unjust
heron
wagged
her
head
as
one
who
is
not
to
be
deceived
by
any
affectation
of
innocence
no
thank
you
ida
she
exclaimed
that
wo
do
for
us
we
seen
it
with
our
own
eyes
have
we
isabel
isabel
took
out
her
handkerchief
and
began
to
whimper
i
should
never
have
thought
it
of
you
ida
she
sobbed
and
with
george
too
and
i
only
just
told
you
that
that
there
had
been
things
between
us
i
do
think
you
might
have
left
him
alone
ida
was
half
distracted
but
you
really
can
not
mean
it
she
pleaded
i
have
done
nothing
said
nothing
you
surely
do
not
complain
of
his
speaking
to
me
of
his
being
simply
civil
and
polite
heaven
knows
i
had
no
desire
to
exchange
a
word
with
him
i
would
not
have
come
down
if
isabel
had
not
asked
me
and
i
had
thought
you
would
have
considered
it
rude
of
me
to
remain
upstairs
oh
what
can
i
say
to
convince
you
that
you
are
mistaken
that
i
never
gave
a
thought
to
this
gentleman
i
forget
his
name
that
i
do
not
care
if
i
never
see
him
again
and
that
isabel
surely
you
do
not
think
me
capable
of
the
vulgarity
the
stupidity
with
which
your
mother
charges
me
isabel
sniffs
and
sobs
only
grew
louder
and
her
demonstrative
misery
worked
heron
to
a
higher
pitch
of
resentment
and
virtuous
indignation
that
is
right
isabel
do
not
answer
her
it
is
all
pretence
and
deceit
on
her
part
she
knows
very
well
that
she
was
doing
her
best
to
attract
his
attention
smiling
and
making
eyes
at
him
and
attempting
to
catch
him
just
as
she
has
caught
poor
joseph
ida
slight
figure
sprang
erect
her
face
grew
crimson
and
her
eyes
flashed
with
a
just
wrath
which
could
no
longer
be
suppressed
i
think
you
must
be
mad
she
said
in
a
low
voice
indeed
you
must
be
mad
or
you
would
not
insult
me
in
this
way
if
i
were
guilty
of
the
conduct
of
which
you
accuse
me
i
should
not
be
fit
to
live
should
not
be
fit
to
remain
in
any
respectable
house
you
are
guilty
retorted
heron
and
as
to
your
being
fit
to
remain
under
this
roof
and
it
was
a
respectable
and
happy
one
until
you
came
you
are
the
best
judge
i
shall
inform
your
cousin
john
of
what
has
passed
it
is
my
duty
to
do
so
and
he
shall
decide
whether
you
are
to
remain
a
firebrand
and
a
disturber
of
the
peace
of
a
christian
household
it
is
my
duty
to
protect
my
poor
boy
at
that
moment
the
hall
door
was
opened
and
closed
and
the
poor
boy
after
shuffling
about
in
the
hall
for
a
moment
or
two
opened
the
door
his
hat
was
on
the
back
of
his
head
one
end
of
his
collar
was
unfastened
his
face
was
flushed
and
there
was
mud
on
his
coat
as
if
he
had
fallen
which
he
had
he
lurched
into
the
room
with
a
tipsy
leer
and
nodded
to
them
with
an
affectation
of
extreme
sobriety
which
is
unfortunately
always
assumed
by
the
individual
who
is
hopelessly
intoxicated
heron
rose
with
outstretched
hands
oh
joseph
are
you
ill
my
poor
boy
ill
he
repeated
with
a
hiccough
no
i
not

he
looked
at
ida
and
shook
his
head
reproachfully
knows
but
she
do
care
but
whatsh
the
matter
he
broke
off
staring
at
isabel
who
was
still
struggling
with
her
sniffs
and
sobs
whatsh
up

he
lurched
towards
ida
and
as
she
drew
back
with
a
shudder
of
horror
and
loathing
isabel
and
his
mother
caught
the
wretched
young
man
by
the
arm
and
with
cries
of
alarm
and
commiseration
endeavoured
to
soothe
him
do
speak
to
her

of

struggled
feebly
with

and
cast
enamoured
and
reassuring
glances
at

and
stern
face

chapter
xxxv
at
this
point
john
heron
ring
and
knock
were
heard
at
the
door
with
a
cry
of
terror
the
unfortunate
mother
succeeded
in
dragging
the
feebly
struggling
joseph
out
of
the
room
and
with
isabel
assistance
hustled
and
pushed
him
up
the
stairs
before
his
father
was
let
in
after
a
time
heron
came
down
again
and
ida
heard
her
and
her
husband
talking
together
you
could
whisper
in
one
room
of
laburnum
villa
without
being
heard
in
another
one
and
presently
the
door
opened
and
john
heron
entered
ida
had
waited
for
she
had
expected
him
he
was
red
and
swollen
with
pomposity
and
resentment
though
he
assumed
a
air
and
threw
a
deeply
grieved
tone
into
his
harsh
raucous
voice
i
am
deeply
grieved
and
shocked
ida
he
began
to
hear
from
your
cousin
so
deplorable
an
account
of
your
conduct
i
am
not
so
unwise
as
to
look
for
gratitude
in
this
world
but
i
did
not
think
you
would
repay
our
kindness
and
consideration
by
attempting
to
wreck
the
happiness
of
a
quiet
and
godly
home
of
course
i
make
all
allowances
for
your
i
am
aware
that
in
the
state
of
life
from
which
we
rescued
you
the
spiritual
and
the
religious
were
entirely
absent
but
i
had
hopes
that
our
precept
and
i
may
say
example
the
influence
of
a
deeply
religious
family
by
this
time
his
voice
had
slid
into
the
nasal
whine
and
growl
which
it
assumed
in
the
pulpit
and
ida
notwithstanding
her
wretchedness
again
felt
an
almost
irresistible
desire
to
laugh
please
tell
me
cousin
john
what
it
is
i
have
done
what
it
is
you
complain
of
she
broke
in
angered
by
the
interruption
for
there
is
nothing
a
man
like
john
heron
hates
worse
he
snapped
out
you
have
been
trying
to
snare
the
affections
of
my
son
you
have
even
cast
lascivious
eyes
at
the
stranger
within
our
gates
the
blood
rushed
to
ida
face
then
she
laughed
outright
the
laugh
of
desperation
for
indeed
she
despaired
of
convincing
these
stupid
people
of
her
innocence
the
laugh
naturally
exasperated
john
heron
and
his
gaunt
face
grew
pallid
for
an
instant
i
understand
he
said
you
treat
our
remonstrances
with
scorn
you
scoff
at
our
rebuke
yes
i
am
afraid
i
ca
help
it
cousin
john
said
ida
i
am
sorry
that
you
should
think
me
so
wicked
and
so
dangerous
and
i
quite
agree
with
isabel
and
her
mother
that
if
i
am
as
bad
as
you
say
i
am
not
fit
to
live
in
a
respectable
house
and
with
decent
people
it
would
be
useless
for
me
to
assure
you
that
you
are
all
ridiculously
mistaken
my
wife
and
daughter
saw
with
their
own
eyes
i
am
informed
that
my
son
is
at
this
very
moment
in
bed
prostrated
by
your
heartless
conduct
you
have
trifled
with
that
most
delicate
and
sacred
of
things
a
human
heart
go
to
your
chamber
ida
and
there
i
trust
you
will
seek
repentance
on
your
knees
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
then
ida
said
very
quietly
have
you
anything
more
to
say
to
me
not
said
john
sternly
i
am
wearied
with
i
have
been
preaching
calling
sinners
like
yourself
to
a
better
life
i
will
speak
with
you
again
i
will
endeavour
to
snatch
a
brand
from
the
burning
said
ida
she
paused
with
her
hand
on
the
door
cousin
john
you
came
to
me
when
i
was
in
great
trouble
you
offered
me
a
home
when
i
was
homeless
i
think
you
have
been
as
kind
as
you
knew
how
to
be
and
i
want
to
thank
you
i
daresay
it
is
my
fault
that
i
have
not
got
on
better
with
you
all
i
am
not
so
bad
as
you
think
but
we
will
say
no
more
about
that
i
do
not
want
you
to
consider
me
ungrateful
for
indeed
i
am
grateful
for
the
shelter
you
have
given
me
and
i
shall
always
remember
that
you
came
to
my
aid
when
i
was
in
sore
need
will
you
please
ask
my
cousin
and
isabel
to
forgive
me
for
having
unwittingly
caused
them
so
much
trouble
said
john
heron
grimly
i
should
be
comforted
if
i
could
think
that
you
were
speaking
from
your
heart
but
i
fear
that
you
are
not
i
fear
that
you
are
not
oh
may
that
heart
be
melted
may
you
be
brought
to
see
the
peril
of
your
evil
ways
followed
by
this
devout
prayer
ida
went
up
to
her
room
as
she
paced
up
and
down
she
tried
to
tell
herself
that
the
whole
thing
was
too
ridiculous
was
too
much
like
a
farce
to
make
her
wretched
but
she
felt
unutterably
miserable
and
she
knew
that
she
could
no
longer
endure
laburnum
villa
and
the
petty
tyranny
and
vindictiveness
of
these
relations
poverty
hardship
she
could
have
borne
patiently
and
without
complaining
but
there
are
some
things
more
intolerable
to
a
girl
such
as
ida
than
poverty
or
physical
hardship
there
are
some
things
which
hurt
more
than
actual
blows
she
felt
stifling
choking
she
knew
that
happen
what
might
she
could
not
remain
under
her
cousin
roof
eat
the
bread
of
his
charity
for
another
day
she
shuddered
as
she
pictured
herself
meeting
them
at
the
facing
heron
spiteful
face
eyes
and
her
cousin
john
sanctimonious
sermon
she
would
have
to
go
she
thrust
a
few
things
into
a
bag
and
took
out
her
purse
and
counted
the
contents
they
amounted
to
six
pounds
and
a
few
shillings
but
small
though
the
sum
was
she
thought
that
it
would
maintain
her
until
she
could
find
some
way
of
earning
a
livelihood
though
at
the
moment
she
had
not
the
least
idea
what
she
could
find
to
do
without
undressing
she
threw
herself
on
the
bed
and
tried
to
sleep
but
her
heart
ached
too
acutely
and
her
brain
was
too
active
to
permit
of
sleep
and
try
as
she
would
her
mind
would
travel
back
to
those
brief
days
of
happiness
at
herondale
and
she
was
haunted
by
the
remembrance
of
stafford
and
the
love
which
she
had
lost
and
at
times
that
past
was
almost
effaced
by
the
vision
of
stafford
seated
beside
maude
falconer
at
the
concert
as
soon
as
she
heard
the
servants
moving
about
the
house
she
rose
pale
and
weary
and
putting
on
her
outdoor
things
stole
with
her
bag
in
her
hand
the
servants
were
busy
in
the
kitchen
and
she
unfastened
the
hall
door
and
left
the
house
without
attracting
any
attention
the
fresh
morning
air
while
it
roused
her
to
a
sense
of
her
position
revived
and
encouraged
her
after
all
she
was
young
and
strong
and
she
looked
up
at
the
house
of
bondage
which
she
was
leaving
she
was
free
oh
blessed
freedom
how
often
she
had
read
of
it
and
heard
it
extolled
but
she
had
never
known
until
this
moment
how
great
how
sweet
a
thing
it
was
she
waited
at
the
mean
little
station
until
a
workmen
train
came
up
and
hustled
by
the
crowd
of
sleepy
and
weary
toilers
got
into
it
when
she
left
the
terminus
she
walked
with
a
portion
of
the
throng
which
turned
up
bishopsgate
street
though
any
other
direction
would
have
suited
her
as
well
or
as
little
for
she
had
no
idea
where
to
go
or
what
to
do
beyond
seeking
some
inexpensive
lodging
she
knew
well
enough
that
she
could
not
afford
to
go
to
a
hotel
that
she
would
have
to
be
content
with
a
small
room
perhaps
an
attic
and
the
plainest
of
food
while
she
sought
for
work
it
was
soon
evident
to
her
that
she
was
not
likely
to
find
what
she
was
looking
for
in
the
broad
thoroughfare
of
shops
and
offices
and
beginning
to
feel
bewildered
by
the
crowd
which
early
as
it
was
streamed
along
the
pavements
she
turned
off
into
one
of
the
narrower
streets
the
long
arm
of
coincidence
which
thrusts
itself
into
all
our
affairs
led
her
to
the
minories
and
to
the
very
quay
which
stafford
had
reached
in
his
aimless
wanderings
and
mechanically
she
paused
and
looked
on
dreamily
at
the
bustle
and
confusion
which
reigned
there
perhaps
the
presence
of
the
sheep
and
cattle
attracted
her
she
felt
drawn
to
them
by
sympathy
with
their
hustled
and
hurried
condition
which
so
nearly
resembled
her
own
with
one
hand
resting
on
a
rail
and
a
bag
in
the
other
she
watched
the
men
as
they
drove
the
cattle
up
the
gangways
or
lowered
huge
casks
and
bales
into
the
hold
a
big
fat
man
with
a
slouch
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
a
pipe
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
which
did
not
prevent
him
shouting
and
bawling
at
the
men
and
the
animals
lurched
here
and
there
like
one
of
the
casks
and
in
the
midst
of
his
shouting
and
bawling
he
every
now
and
then
glanced
at
a
watch
of
the
order
it
was
evident
even
to
the
inexperienced
ida
that
the
vessel
was
about
to
start
the
sailors
were
rushing
about
on
deck
in
the
haste
and
excitement
of
ordered
disorder
chains
were
clanking
and
ropes
and
pulleys
were
shrieking
and
a
steam
whistle
shrieked
at
intervals
and
added
to
the
multitudinous
noises
poor
sheep
poor
bulls
murmured
ida
as
the
last
of
the
beasts
were
driven
up
the
gangway
and
disappeared
perhaps
you
have
come
from
another
herondale
do
you
remember
do
you
look
back
as
i
do
she
drew
back
for
the
big
man
suddenly
lurched
in
her
direction
and
indeed
almost
against
her
beg
pardon
miss
he
said
touching
his
slouch
hat
anything
i
can
do
for
you
anybody
you
looking
for
no
oh
no
said
ida
blushing
and
turning
away
joffler
for
it
was
that
genial
australian
nodded
and
stretched
his
face
in
a
smile
thought
you
come
to
say
to
someone
wish
it
was
me
though
if
it
was
i
an
idea
that
i
should
stay
on
air
or
no
air
and
i
blest
if
there
ai
precious
little
about
this
morning
hi
there
all
ready
bless
it
all
we
be
too
late
for
the
tide
if
he
do
come
he
said
to
the
captain
who
stood
with
one
foot
on
the
taffrail
an
expression
of
impatience
on
his
face
like
enough
he
ai
comin
joffler
he
said
them
kind
gents
is
always
slippery
i
dessay
though
i
did
think
as
this
one
was
one
of
that
kind
too
much
grit
about
him
ah
and
i
was
not
mistaken
here
he
is
get
ready
there
he
turned
and
ida
instinctively
turning
with
him
saw
a
tall
figure
clad
in
a
serge
suit
making
its
way
quickly
through
the
crowd
of
busy
and
idly
lounging
spectators
he
came
straight
to
the
big
fat
man
who
greeted
him
jovially
and
loudly
and
they
passed
side
by
side
on
to
the
vessel
ida
drew
a
long
breath
and
passed
her
hand
over
her
brow
it
was
absurd
of
course
it
was
a
trick
of
the
imagination
of
a
wearied
and
overstrained
brain
but
the
tall
figure
in
the
blue
serge
ah
how
like
it
was
to
that
of
stafford
it
disappeared
with
that
of
the
big
man
into
the
vessel
and
with
a
sigh
she
was
coming
away
when
she
saw
the
two
men
coming
along
the
deck
and
mount
to
the
quarter
the
fat
man
was
talking
and
laughing
but
the
man
in
the
blue
serge
was
grave
and
silent
as
if
he
was
lost
in
thought
and
not
listening
suddenly
as
she
paused
the
younger
slimmer
figure
turned
in
her
direction
and
uttered
a
cry
a
cry
almost
of
terror
was
she
demented
had
her
longing
her
aching
longing
for
a
sight
of
him
called
up
this
vision
of
stafford
unless
she
were
out
of
her
mind
the
victim
of
a
strange
hallucination
it
was
he
himself
who
stood
there
his
face
pale
and
haggard
turned
towards
her
stafford
she
cried
unconsciously
and
her
hand
gripped
the
iron
rail
in
front
of
her
as
if
he
had
heard
her
though
it
was
impossible
that
her
voice
could
reach
him
through
the
shouts
of
the
sailors
the
lowing
and
bleating
of
the
cattle
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
in
her
direction
their
eyes
met
and
were
enchained
for
a
moment
which
seemed
an
eternity
then
the
blood
flew
to
his
face
leaving
it
the
next
moment
paler
than
before
he
swung
round
to
the
fat
man
by
his
side
and
clutched
his
arm
wait
stop
the
vessel
i
want
to
go
ashore
he
said
hoarsely
joffler
stared
at
him
then
laughed
hold
on
sir
he
said
not
unsympathetically
hold
on
took
queer
like
lor
bless
you
i
know
how
the
feelin
is
it
catches
at
you
right
in
the
middle
of

waistcoat

thought

from
you

well
away
here

a
sip
of
this

get
over
it
in
a
brace
o
shakes
he
thrust
a
flask
into
stafford
hand
but
stafford
put
it
away
from
him
let
me
go
ashore
i
join
you
later
he
said
breathlessly
joffler
caught
his
arm
as
he
was
about
to
jump
for
the
quay
steady
steady
sir
he
admonished
soothingly
we
ca
stop
and
you
break
your
neck
trying
to
jump
it
and
all
for
a
fancy
too
stake
my
life
hearten
up
man
hearten
up
you
not
the
first
to
feel
sick
and
sorry
at
leavin
home
and
friends
stafford
bit
his
lip
and
tried
to
pull
himself
together
but
his
eyes
were
still
fixed
on
the
pale
face
the
girlish
figure
and
his
voice
was
shaky
as
he
said
you
right
joffler
it
is
too
late
now
i
i
thought
i
saw
someone
on
the
quay
there
but
it
must
have
been
fancy
it
is
impossible
quite
impossible
that
it
said
joffler
with
a
sympathetic
wink
lor
love
you
i
had
them
kind
o
fancies
myself
especially
after
a
hot
night
on
shore
if
you
only
take
a
pull
at
this
you
be
all
right
directly
it
do
do
to
come
aboard
too
sober
when
you
old
england
for
the
first
time
do
you
see
now
ida
had
moved
away
and
stafford
drew
a
long
breath
and
forced
a
smile
no
he
said
huskily
and
almost
to
himself
yes
it
must
have
been
fancy
she
could
not
have
been
there
it
is
impossible
joffler
whistled
and
winked
to
himself
comprehendingly
she
he
murmured
ah
that
it
is
it
ah
well
i
been
there
myself
do
you
let
the
fancy
upset
you
sir
it
pass
afore
we
gets
into
the
open

like
the
sea
for
teachin
you
to
forget

you
come
down
below
and
try
and
peck
a
bit
there
cold
beef
pickles
that
send
them
kind
o
fancies
to
the
right
about
ida
turned
and
walked
quickly
away
her
head
swam
she
looked
like
one
in
a
dream
it
was
of
course
impossible
that
the
man
she
had
seen
could
be
stafford
stafford
on
board
a
but
the
hallucination
had
made
her
feel
faint
and
she
remembered
that
she
had
eaten
nothing
since
yesterday
at
noon
and
she
ascribed
this
freak
of
her
imagination
to
the
weakness
caused
by
want
of
food
she
left
the
quay
slowly
as
if
her
heart
and
her
strength
and
all
her
life
hope
had
gone
with
the
dingy
vessel
and
emerging
on
the
narrow
crowded
street
looked
for
some
shop
at
which
she
could
buy
a
roll
of
bread
presently
she
saw
a
baker
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
to
that
on
which
she
was
walking
and
she
was
crossing
when
a
huge
empty
van
came
lumbering
round
the
corner
she
drew
back
to
let
it
pass
and
as
she
did
so
a
lighter
cart
came
swiftly
upon
her
she
was
so
dazed
so
bewildered
by
the
vision
she
had
seen
and
the
noise
of
the
street
that
she
stood
hesitating
uncertain
whether
to
go
on
or
retreat
to
the
pavement
she
had
left
the
woman
or
man
who
hesitates
in
the
middle
of
a
busy
london
street
is
lost
the
cart
was
upon
her
before
she
had
moved
the
shaft
struck
her
on
the
shoulder
and
down
she
went
into
the
muddy
road
the
driver
jerked
the
horse
aside
and
leapt
from
his
seat
the
usual
crowd
which
seems
to
spring
instantaneously
from
the
very
stones
collected
and
surged
round
the
usual
policeman
forced
his
way
through
and
ida
was
picked
up
and
carried
to
the
pavement
there
was
a
patch
of
blood
on
the
side
of
her
head
the
dear
small
head
which
had
rested
on
stafford
breast
so
often
and
she
was
unconscious
struck
with
said
the
policeman
sententiously
boy
call
a
keb
i
have
your
name
and
address
young
man
a
cab
was
brought
and
ida
still
unconscious
was
carried
to
the
london
hospital
and
lay
there
in
the
white
painfully
clean
ward
attended
by
the
most
skillful
doctors
in
england
and
by
the
grave
and
silent
nurses
who
notwithstanding
their
lives
of
stress
and
toil
had
not
lost
the
capacity
for
pity
and
sympathy
indeed
no
one
with
a
heart
in
her
bosom
could
stand
up
unmoved
and
hear
the
girl
moaning
and
crying
in
a
whisper
for
stafford
day
and
night
the
white
lips
framed
the
same
name
stafford
stafford
as
if
her
soul
were
in
the
cry
chapter
xxxvi
when
ida
came
to
she
found
the
sister
of
the
ward
and
a
young
nurse
bending
over
her
with
placid
and
smiling
faces
why
a
hospital
nurse
should
under
any
and
every
circumstance
be
invariably
cheerful
is
one
of
those
mysteries
worthy
to
rank
with
the
problem
contained
in
the
fact
that
an
undertaker
is
nearly
always
of
a
merry
disposition
of
course
ida
asked
the
usual
questions
where
am
i
and
how
long
have
i
been
here
and
the
sister
told
her
that
she
was
in
the
alexandria
ward
of
the
london
hospital
and
that
she
had
been
there
unconscious
for
ten
days
the
nurse
smiled
as
if
it
were
the
best
joke
in
a
mild
way
in
the
world
and
answered
ida
further
questions
while
she
administered
beef
tea
with
an
air
of
pride
and
satisfaction
which
made
her
plain
and
homely
face
seem
angelic
to
ida
you
were
knocked
down
by
a
cart
you
know
said
nurse
brown
you
were
badly
injured
that
is
no
bones
were
broken
as
is
very
often
the
case
that
girl
there
in
the
next
bed
but
two
had
one
arm
one
leg
and
two
ribs
broken
mail
cart
and
that
poor
woman
opposite
got
both
arms
and
a
broken
but
i
must
harrow
you
with
our
bad
cases
she
said
quickly
as
ida
seemed
to
wince
of
course
you
feel
very
strange
i
suppose
this
is
the
first
time
you
have
been
in
a
hospital
ward
yes
replied
ida
glancing
round
timidly
ah
yes
of
course
said
nurse
brown
nodding
and
smiling
encouragingly
and
you
feel
shy
and
nervous
but
if
you
only
knew
it
you
are
better
off
here
than
you
would
be
anywhere
else
you
have
the
very
best
surgeons
in
the
world
we
are
awfully
proud
of
them
and
though
i
ought
not
to
say
it
the
best
of
nursing
you
are
watched
night
and
day
and
you
get
the
least
wee
little
thing
you
want
if
good
for
you
i
daresay
you
wo
care
to
stay
here
but
will
like
to
be
taken
away
as
soon
as
you
are
well
enough
to
be
moved
for
of
course
we
all
know
that
you
are
a
lady
oh
it
is
the
first
time
we
have
had
a
lady
in
the
ward
a
great
many
of
them
come
down
here
and
sometimes
they
get
run
over
as
you
have
been
or
they
fall
down
some
of
the
dark
and
rickety
stairs
or
hurt
themselves
in
some
other
way
it
wonderful
what
a
choice
of
accidents
you
can
have
in
this
busy
and
crowded
part
of
london
after
a
pause
she
went
on
of
course
you
will
go
away
as
soon
as
you
can
but
it
a
pity
it
really
is
you
ever
so
much
better
off
here
and
you
soon
get
used
to
the
other
people
in
the
ward
though
they
are
of
a
different
class
to
yourself
but
though
most
of
them
are
very
poor
and
some
of
them
are
usually
rough
when
they
are
at
home
it
is
wonderfully
how
patient
they
are
you
will
scarcely
ever
hear
a
murmur
only
a
sigh
now
and
again
and
they
are
so
grateful
that
sometimes
they
bring
the
tears
to
your
eyes
and
it
quite
hard
to
part
from
them
when
they
get
well
and
are
discharged
but
i
really
must
talk
to
you
any
more
she
murmured
penitently
and
the
soft
placid
voice
ceased
ida
looked
round
the
ward
her
heart
beating
as
fast
as
her
condition
would
allow
as
nurse
brown
had
said
she
felt
terribly
strange
and
nervous
in
the
long
whitewashed
ward
which
however
was
rendered
cheerful
enough
by
the
dozens
of
pictures
from
illustrated
papers
which
had
been
fastened
to
the
walls
and
by
the
vases
and
great
bowls
of
flowers
which
seemed
to
occupy
every
suitable
spot
she
closed
her
eyes
and
tried
to
think
but
she
fell
asleep
instead
and
dreamt
that
she
had
fallen
off
rupert
and
was
lying
on
the
moss
beside
the
river
quite
comfortable
and
most
absurdly
content
when
she
woke
the
sister
was
standing
beside
her
and
nodded
with
cheerful
approval
that
better
miss
heron
she
said
it
is
quite
pleasant
to
watch
you
asleep
and
not
to
hear
you
rambling
ida
face
flushed
have
i
been
rambling
she
asked
what
have
i
said
you
know
my
name
the
nurse
smiled
your
things
are
marked
she
explained
but
there
was
no
address
nothing
which
could
help
us
to
communicate
with
your
friends
or
we
would
have
done
so
you
will
tell
us
where
to
send
now
will
you
not
ida
blushed
again
and
felt
troubled
why
should
she
annoy
and
worry
the
herons
she
shuddered
slightly
as
she
pictured
her
cousin
john
standing
beside
the
bed
where
the
sweet
and
sister
now
stood
and
preaching
at
her
they
would
want
to
take
her
back
to
loburnum
villa
and
ida
regarded
the
prospect
of
return
to
that
cheerful
abode
of
the
christian
virtues
as
a
prisoner
might
regard
the
prospect
of
returning
to
his
gaol
the
sister
regarded
her
keenly
without
appearing
to
do
so
perhaps
you
would
rather
remain
quietly
for
a
few
days
miss
heron
she
suggested
sweetly
ida
eyes
they
looked
preternaturally
large
violet
orbs
in
her
white
face
beamed
gratefully
oh
yes
yes
if
i
may
shall
i
be
ill
long
how
soon
will
it
be
before
i
can
go
it
is
about
as
difficult
to
get
a
definite
answer
from
a
nurse
as
from
a
doctor
oh
some
days
yet
replied
the
sister
cheerfully
you
must
not
go
until
you
are
quite
strong
in
fact
we
should
not
let
you
now
you
lie
quite
still
and
try
and
sleep
again
if
you
can
and
you
can
think
over
whether
you
would
like
to
communicate
with
your
friends
or
not
if
you
ask
my
advice
i
shall
say
like
punch
i
wo
said
ida
with
her
rare
smile
the
sister
nodded
and
left
her
and
ida
closed
her
eyes
again
but
not
to
sleep
she
recalled
her
flight
from
laburnum
villa
her
wandering
through
the
streets
the
crowded
and
noisy
quay
and
the
strange
hallucination
the
vision
of
stafford
standing
on
the
stern
of
the
vessel
of
course
it
was
only
a
vision
an
hallucination
but
how
real
it
had
seemed
so
real
that
it
was
almost
difficult
to
believe
that
it
was
not
he
himself
she
smiled
sadly
at
the
thought
of
stafford
the
son
of
the
great
sir
stephen
orme
sailing
in
a
the
hours
passed
in
a
kind
of
peaceful
monotony
broken
by
the
frequent
visits
of
nurse
brown
and
the
house
surgeon
with
his
grave
face
and
preoccupied
air
and
for
some
time
ida
lay
in
a
kind
of
feeling
that
everything
that
was
going
on
around
her
were
the
unreal
actions
in
a
dream
but
as
she
grew
stronger
she
began
to
take
an
interest
in
the
life
of
the
great
ward
and
her
and
on
the
second
day
after
her
return
to
consciousness
began
a
conversation
with
her
neighbour
a
woman
who
had
eyed
her
wistfully
several
times
but
who
had
been
too
shy
to
address
the
young
lady
she
was
a
country
woman
from
dorsetshire
up
to
london
on
a
visit
to
my
daughter
miss
which
is
married
to
a
man
as
keeps
a
dairy
it
was
her
first
visit
to
london
she
had
wandered
from
her
daughter
lost
her
and
in
her
confusion
tumbled
down
the
cellar
of
a
she
told
ida
the
history
of
some
of
the
other
cases
and
ida
found
herself
listening
with
an
interest
which
astonished
her
nurse
brown
seeing
the
two
talking
nodded
approvingly
that
right
she
said
with
a
smile
you
keep
each
other
company
it
passes
the
time
away
very
soon
ida
found
herself
taking
an
interest
in
everything
that
went
on
in
the
noiseless
movements
of
the
nurses
in
the
arrival
of
a
new
case
in
the
visit
of
the
doctors
and
the
chaplain
and
the
friends
of
the
other
patients
let
the
pessimists
say
what
they
may
there
is
a
lot
of
good
in
human
nature
and
it
comes
out
quite
startlingly
in
the
ward
of
a
hospital
ida
was
amazed
at
the
care
and
attention
the
patience
and
the
devotion
which
were
lavished
on
herself
and
her
a
devotion
which
no
money
can
buy
and
which
could
not
have
been
exceeded
if
they
had
one
and
all
been
princesses
of
the
blood
royal
one
instance
of
this
devotion
and
unstinting
charity
occurred
on
the
third
day
and
brought
the
tears
to
her
eyes
not
only
then
but
whenever
she
thought
of
it
in
the
after
years
a
tiny
mite
of
a
baby
only
a
few
weeks
old
was
brought
into
the
ward
and
laid
in
a
cot
not
very
far
from
ida
bed
the
nurses
and
the
doctors
crowded
round
it
with
eager
attention
it
was
watched
day
and
night
if
it
cried
at
the
first
note
of
the
feeble
wail
a
couple
of
nurses
flew
to
the
cot
and
if
necessary
a
famous
physician
was
telephoned
for
and
came
promptly
and
cheerfully
the
whole
ward
was
wrapped
up
in
the
tiny
mite
and
ida
leant
on
her
elbow
and
craned
forward
to
get
a
glimpse
of
it
and
felt
towards
it
as
she
would
have
felt
if
it
had
been
a
little
sick
or
wounded
lamb
in
herondale
what
is
the
matter
with
it
poor
little
thing
she
asked
the
sister
the
spine
replied
the
sister
bending
tenderly
over
the
cot
and
taking
the
emaciated
little
paw
in
her
comforting
ministering
hand
will
it
get
well
asked
ida
quite
anxiously
the
sister
shook
her
head
lor
bless
me
said
ida
neighbour
pityingly
it
be
almost
better
if
the
pore
little
thing
died
the
sister
looked
up
with
mild
surprise
oh
yes
it
ca
live
longer
than
three
weeks
she
said
as
sadly
as
if
she
had
not
seen
a
score
of
similar
cases
ida
lay
down
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
her
heart
filled
with
awe
and
wonder
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
understood
what
charity
meant
here
was
a
waif
of
the
slums
doomed
to
die
in
so
many
weeks
and
yet
it
was
the
object
of
the
loving
devotion
of
every
nurse
in
the
ward
with
every
comfort
and
luxury
which
an
age
of
civilisation
could
supply
and
the
recipient
of
the
enthusiastic
attention
of
a
great
surgeon
whose
name
was
famous
throughout
the
world
the
woman
in
the
next
bed
was
crying
too
it
makes
you
think
of
do
it
miss
she
said
with
a
sniff
if
i
was
rich
i
leave
all
my
money
to
a
that
i
would
the
speech
suddenly
reminded
ida
of
her
own
poverty
of
which
she
had
not
thought
very
much
for
the
need
of
money
is
not
very
keenly
felt
in
a
hospital
ward
where
everything
is
free
gratis
for
nothing
the
time
came
when
she
was
permitted
to
get
up
and
nothing
could
exceed
her
amazement
on
finding
herself
so
weak
that
her
legs
trembled
under
her
and
the
walls
and
the
floor
seemed
to
rock
and
heave
but
in
a
day
or
two
she
was
able
to
walk
a
little
and
she
at
once
begged
permission
to
help
nurse
the
baby
it
was
against
the
rules
but
it
was
very
difficult
for
anyone
to
resist
ida
when
she
turned
those
great
violet
eyes
upon
them
imploringly
and
much
to
her
delight
she
was
permitted
to
hover
about
the
cot
and
assist
in
an
unofficial
way
when
the
baby
was
asleep
which
was
not
particularly
often
ida
was
permitted
to
read
to
some
of
the
other
patients
and
in
fact
make
herself
generally
useful
in
an
unobtrusive
fashion
this
was
all
very
well
but
the
day
arrived
when
she
was
strong
enough
to
leave
the
hospital
and
once
more
face
that
world
which
has
been
described
as
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds
and
no
doubt
is
for
those
who
have
plenty
of
money
and
friends
but
which
is
not
far
from
being
the
worst
of
all
possible
worlds
for
those
who
have
not
she
took
five
pounds
from
her
little
store
and
went
to
the
sister
i
am
rather
poor
she
said
with
a
smile
and
i
can
not
afford
more
than
this
i
wish
it
were
a
hundred
times
as
much
indeed
no
money
could
repay
your
goodness
and
kindness
to
me
the
wonder
of
which
i
shall
never
cease
to
feel
the
sister
looked
at
her
keenly
but
said
very
gently
you
can
put
it
in
the
box
in
the
hall
when
you
go
out
but
you
will
not
go
i
will
arrange
for
you
to
stop
until
in
fact
the
baby
none
of
us
could
spare
you
i
want
you
to
have
some
ten
with
me
in
my
room
and
a
little
talk
miss
heron
so
ida
turned
away
quickly
that
the
sister
might
not
see
her
tears
and
accepted
the
reprieve
chapter
xxxvii
the
herons
were
not
very
much
surprised
at
ida
flight
but
though
john
and
his
wife
and
daughter
were
anything
but
sorry
to
get
rid
of
her
they
were
rather
uncomfortable
and
joseph
who
was
in
the
doldrums
after
his
did
not
make
them
more
comfortable
by
assuring
them
that
he
was
perfectly
certain
she
had
committed
suicide
he
and
his
father
set
out
to
look
for
her
but
as
ida
had
left
no
clue
behind
they
could
find
no
trace
of
her
though
they
procured
the
assistance
of
scotland
yard
and
inserted
guarded
advertisements
in
the
newspapers
john
heron
comforted
himself
with
the
reflection
that
she
could
have
come
to
no
harm
or
they
would
have
heard
of
it
and
at
last
it
occurred
to
him
when
nearly
a
fortnight
had
elapsed
that
she
might
have
returned
to
herondale
probably
to
the
care
of
wordley
and
that
he
had
been
too
indignant
to
acquaint
the
herons
with
the
fact
i
think
i
had
better
run
down
to
herondale
maria
and
ascertain
if
the
erring
and
desperate
girl
has
returned
there
he
said
one
morning
after
prayers
seeing
that
she
left
my
roof
in
so
unseemly
a
fashion
with
no
word
of
regret
or
repentance
i
do
not
consider
that
she
has
any
further
claim
upon
me
but
i
have
a
tender
heart
and
on
this
occasion
i
will
be
generous
before
i
am
just
i
am
sure
she
has
no
further
claim
upon
us
said
heron
with
a
sniff
and
i
hope
you
will
make
it
plain
john
that
on
no
account
can
we
take
her
back
we
have
been
put
to
considerable
trouble
and
expense
and
i
really
think
that
her
going
without
any
fuss
is
quite
providential
at
this
moment
there
came
a
double
knock
at
the
door
and
the
servant
announced
that
wordley
was
in
the
and
heron
exchanged
glances
and
both
of
them
turned
rather
pale
for
john
heron
had
a
very
vivid
recollection
of
wordley
frank
and
candid
manner
of
expressing
himself
but
he
had
to
be
faced
and
the
pair
went
down
into
the
with
a
expression
on
their
faces
wordley
however
appeared
to
be
quite
cheerful
he
shook
hands
with
both
of
them
and
enquired
after
their
health
and
that
of
their
family
quite
amiably
and
pleasantly
most
delightful
weather
is
it
he
remarked
quite
pleasant
travelling
you
have
a
remarkably
or
convenient
house
heron
charming
suburb
will
no
doubt
be
quite
gay
and
fashionable
when
it
is
er
more
fully
developed
you
are
looking
well
mr
heron
heron
whatever
he
may
have
looked
was
feeling
anything
but
well
at
that
moment
for
he
suspected
than
the
lawyer
was
only
masking
his
attack
and
that
he
meant
to
spring
upon
him
presently
i
enjoy
fairly
good
health
wordley
thank
you
he
said
in
his
sanctimonious
way
but
i
have
my
share
of
trials
and
anxieties
in
this
miserable
world
oh
do
call
it
miserable
on
a
morning
like
this
said
wordley
cheerfully
my
dear
sir
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
the
world
it
er
some
of
the
people
in
it
that
try
to
make
it
miserable
while
he
had
been
speaking
he
had
been
glancing
at
the
door
and
listening
as
if
he
had
been
listening
and
expecting
to
hear
and
see
someone
else
the
fact
is
he
said
i
have
come
up
rather
suddenly
on
rather
important
business
came
up
without
a
moment
delay
miss
ida
i
should
like
to
see
her
at
once
please
if
i
may
the
faces
of
the
pair
grew
sallow
and
the
corners
of
john
mouth
dropped
lower
even
than
usual
ida
he
said
in
a
hollow
voice
as
if
he
were
confused
where
is
she
surely
you
know
mr
wordley
i
know
how
should
i
know
i
came
up
to
see
her
not
a
moment
to
spare
is
she
here
why
do
you
both
stare
at
me
like
this
she
is
not
here
said
john
heron
ida
left
our
house
more
than
a
fortnight
ago
wordley
looked
disappointed
and
grunted
oh
gone
to
stay
with
some
friends
i
suppose
i
trouble
you
to
give
me
their
address
heron
please
he
rose
as
he
spoke
as
if
he
meant
starting
on
the
moment
but
he
sank
into
the
chair
again
as
john
heron
said
in
a
sepulchral
voice
i
should
most
willingly
do
so
wordley
but
i
regret
to
say
i
do
not
know
where
she
is
you
do
know
where
she
is
said
wordley
anger
and
amazement
struggling
for
the
upper
hand
what
the
devil
i
beg
your
pardon
heron
you
must
excuse
an
old
man
with
a
short
temper
and
a
touch
of
the
gout
but
i
do
understand
you
why
do
you
know
heron
began
to
sniff
and
her
worthy
husband
drew
himself
up
and
tried
to
look
dignified
and
failed
utterly
in
the
attempt
such
language
he
began
confound
my
language
sir
snapped
the
old
lawyer
his
face
growing
red
be
good
enough
to
answer
my
question
ida
left
our
hospitable
roof
about
a
fortnight
ago
said
heron
she
left
like
a
thief
in
the
night
that
is
to
say
morning
i
regret
to
say
that
she
left
no
message
no
word
of
farewell
behind
her
i
had
occasion
to
rebuke
her
on
the
preceding
night
and
following
the
dictates
of
an
ungodly
nature
and
a
perverse
pride
she
chose
to
leave
the
shelter
of
this
roof
wordley
sprang
to
his
feet
his
passion
rendering
him
speechless
for
a
moment
rebuke
miss
ida
are
you
out
of
your
mind
and
pray
what
had
she
done
she
had
been
guilty
of
attempting
to
ensnare
the
affection
of
my
son
began
john
heron
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
joseph
appeared
wordley
looked
at
him
ensnaring
the
affections
of
he
snorted
with
a
contempt
which
caused
joseph
immediate
retreat
oh
you
be
out
of
your
mind
her
conduct
was
reprehensible
in
other
ways
stammered
john
heron
nonsense
almost
shouted
wordley
i
do
want
to
hear
any
more
of
such
nonsense
miss
ida
conduct
reprehensible
why
she
conduct
herself
in
any
way
than
that
of
a
girl
if
she
tried
you
have
been
entertaining
an
angel
unawares
heron
there
a
bit
of
scripture
for
you
had
a
pearl
in
your
house
and
it
been
cast
before
bless
my
soul
losing
my
temper
but
my
word
there
some
excuse
for
it
let
that
dear
child
leave
your
house
you
lost
sight
of
her
for
over
a
fortnight
and
and
you
stand
there
and
snuffle
to
me
about
her
where
is
she
oh
of
course
you
do
know
and
you
stand
there
like
a
stuck
pig
if
i
were
fool
enough
to
remain
here
for
a
week
and
ask
questions
but
i
want
her
i
want
her
at
once
i
got
important
news
for
her
news
of
the
greatest
importance
i
beg
your
pardon
my
dear
madame
for
the
violence
of
my
language
though
i
could
say
a
great
deal
more
to
this
husband
of
yours
if
i
were
alone
with
him
but
it
no
use
wasting
further
time
i
must
find
her
i
must
find
her
at
once
john
heron
was
as
red
as
a
and
gasping
like
a
cod
out
of
water
this
gross
and
unseemly
attack
is
only
excused
by
your
age
confound
my
age
exclaimed
wordley
let
me
tell
you
sir
your
age
does
not
excuse
your
conduct
which
has
been
that
of
a
heartless
and
sanctimonious
fool
when
i
gave
that
dear
child
into
your
care
i
had
misgivings
and
they
are
fully
justified
would
to
god
i
had
never
lost
sight
of
her
the
dearest
the
sweetest
and
best
oh
let
me
get
out
or
i
shall
say
something
offensive
as
he
made
for
the
door
john
heron
cleared
his
throat
and
stammered
i
forgive
you
sir
you
will
regret
this
exhibition
of
brutal
violence
and
i
shall
put
up
a
prayer
do
you
dare
to
put
up
any
prayer
for
me
cried
wordley
i
should
be
afraid
something
would
happen
to
me
i
need
not
ask
why
she
left
your
house
it
quite
evident
enough
i
nothing
more
to
say
to
you
one
moment
said
john
heron
with
an
attempt
at
dignity
perhaps
you
will
be
good
enough
to
inform
me
of
the
nature
of
the
communication
that
you
have
for
my
cousin
ida
wordley
looked
as
if
he
were
going
to
choke
no
i
will
not
sir
he
at
last
responded
i
will
tell
you
nothing
excepting
that
i
hope
and
trust
i
may
never
see
your
sanctimonious
face
again
madame
he
was
outside
laburnum
villa
with
the
velocity
and
force
of
a
whirlwind
and
was
on
his
road
to
the
station
before
he
could
get
his
breath
or
regain
his
being
a
lawyer
he
of
course
went
straight
to
the
police
but
he
was
shrewd
enough
not
to
go
to
scotland
yard
but
to
the
police
station
near
the
terminus
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
would
be
easier
to
trace
ida
from
that
spot
fortunately
for
him
he
found
an
inspector
in
charge
who
was
both
intelligent
and
zealous
he
listened
attentively
to
the
detailed
statement
and
description
which
the
lawyer
calm
enough
now
furnished
him
and
after
considering
for
a
minute
or
two
during
which
wordley
waited
in
a
legal
silence
asked
young
lady
any
friends
in
london
sir
wordley
replied
in
the
negative
think
she
has
gone
to
a
situation
no
replied
wordley
she
left
suddenly
and
i
do
not
know
what
situation
she
could
find
she
is
a
lady
and
unaccustomed
to
earning
her
bread
in
any
way
then
she
has
met
with
an
accident
said
the
inspector
with
an
air
of
conviction
god
bless
my
soul
my
good
man
exclaimed
wordley
what
makes
you
think
that
experience
sir
replied
the
inspector
calmly
have
you
any
idea
how
many
accidents
there
are
in
a
day
in
london
i
suppose
not
be
surprised
if
i
told
you
what
was
the
date
she
was
missing
wordley
told
him
and
he
turned
to
a
large
red
book
like
a
ledger
as
i
thought
sir
he
said
lady
knocked
down
by
a
light
van
in
goode
street
minories
dark
hair
light
eyes
height
five
feet
nine
age
about
or
two
name
on
clothing
ida
heron
wordley
sprang
to
his
feet
it
is
she
he
exclaimed
was
she
much
hurt
is
is
she
alive
where
is
she
i
must
go
to
her
at
once
london
hospital
replied
the
inspector
succinctly
as
he
turned
to
a
subordinate
call
a
cab
it
was
not
a
particularly
slow
hansom
and
it
did
not
take
very
long
to
get
from
the
police
station
to
the
hospital
but
to
wordley
the
horse
seemed
to
crawl
and
the
minutes
to
grow
into
days
he
leapt
out
of
the
hansom
and
actually
ran
into
the
hall
you
a
patient
ida
heron
he
panted
to
the
hall
porter
the
man
turned
to
his
book
yes
sir
he
said
discharged
yesterday
wordley
staggered
against
the
glass
partition
of
the
porter
box
and
groaned
can
you
tell
me
he
began
has
she
left
any
address
i
i
am
her
solicitor
excuse
my
being
hurried
i
want
her
particularly
the
porter
looked
at
him
sympathetically
everybody
is
sympathetic
at
a
hospital
from
the
head
physician
and
that
puissant
lady
the
matron
down
to
the
boy
who
cleans
the
brass
plate
wo
you
sit
down
sir
he
said
the
young
lady
was
discharged
yesterday
and
i
ca
tell
you
where
she
gone
in
fact
though
i
remember
her
being
brought
in
case
i
like
to
step
upstairs
and
see
the
sister
of
the
ward
she
was
in
the
alexandra
while
he
was
speaking
and
wordley
was
trying
to
recover
command
of
himself
a
slim
figure
came
down
the
hall
and
pausing
before
the
large
tin
box
provided
for
contributions
dropped
something
into
it
wordley
watched
her
absently
she
raised
her
head
and
he
sprang
forward
with
miss
ida
on
his
lips
ida
uttered
a
cry
and
staggered
a
little
for
she
was
not
yet
as
strong
as
the
girl
who
used
to
ride
through
herondale
and
wordley
caught
her
by
both
hands
and
supported
her
thank
god
thank
god
was
all
he
could
exclaim
for
a
minute
my
dear
child
my
dear
miss
ida
sit
down
he
drew
her
to
one
of
the
long
benches
and
sat
down
beside
her
to
his
credit
be
it
stated
that
the
tears
were
in
his
eyes
and
for
a
moment
or
two
he
was
incapable
of
speech
indeed
it
was
ida
who
first
recovered
her
wordley
is
it
really
you
how
did
you
know
how
did
you
find
me
i
am
so
glad
oh
so
glad
she
choked
back
the
tears
that
sprang
to
her
eyes
and
forced
a
laugh
for
again
she
saw
that
he
was
more
upset
than
even
she
was
he
found
his
voice
after
awhile
but
it
was
a
very
husky
one
my
dear
girl
my
dear
miss
ida
he
said
you
are
not
more
glad
than
i
have
been
almost
out
of
my
mind
for
the
last
few
hours
i
came
to
london
all
in
a
hurry
most
important
news
went
to
your
cousin
oh
lord
what
a
fool
that
man
is
heard
you
had
run
away
not
at
all
surprised
should
have
run
away
myself
long
before
you
did
came
up
to
london
in
search
of
you
just
heard
you
gone
from
here
i
ought
to
have
gone
yesterday
said
ida
but
they
let
me
stay
god
bless
them
he
panted
but
how
pale
you
look
and
thin
been
ill
very
ill
and
you
been
unhappy
and
i
did
know
it
what
a
fool
i
was
to
let
you
go
it
was
all
my
fault
i
ought
to
have
known
better
than
to
have
trusted
you
to
that
sanctimonious
idiot
my
dear
i
great
news
for
you
have
you
said
ida
patting
his
hand
soothingly
she
had
caught
something
of
the
gentle
soothing
way
of
the
sister
and
nurses
must
you
tell
me
now
you
are
tired
and
upset
i
must
tell
you
this
very
minute
or
i
shall
burst
said
wordley
my
dear
child
prepare
yourself
for
the
most
astounding
the
most
wonderful
news
i
do
want
to
startle
you
but
i
do
feel
as
though
i
could
keep
it
for
another
half
hour
do
you
think
i
could
have
a
glass
of
water
the
porter
still
sympathetic
at
a
sign
from
ida
produced
the
glass
of
water
and
discreetly
retired
now
said
wordley
with
intense
gravity
prepare
to
be
startled
be
calm
my
dear
child
as
i
am
you
see
i
am
quite
calm
he
was
perspiring
at
every
pore
and
was
mopping
his
forehead
with
a
huge
silk
handkerchief
i
have
just
made
a
great
discovery
you
are
aware
that
herondale
the
whole
estate
is
heavily
mortgaged
and
that
there
was
a
foreclosure
that
means
that
the
whole
of
it
would
have
passed
away
from
you
ida
sighed
yes
i
know
she
said
in
a
low
voice
very
well
then
i
went
over
to
the
house
the
other
day
to
well
to
look
out
any
little
thing
which
i
thought
you
might
like
to
buy
at
the
sale
ida
pressed
his
hand
and
turned
her
head
away
it
was
a
sad
business
sad
very
sad
and
i
wandered
about
the
place
like
a
like
a
lost
spirit
i
was
almost
as
fond
of
it
as
you
are
my
dear
after
i
had
been
over
the
house
i
went
into
the
grounds
and
found
myself
in
the
ruined
chapel
donald
and
bess
followed
me
and
bess
what
a
sharp
little
thing
she
is
bless
her
she
began
to
rout
about
and
presently
she
began
to
dig
with
her
claws
in
a
corner
under
the
ruined
window
i
was
so
lost
in
thought
that
i
stood
and
watched
her
in
an
absent
kind
of
way
but
presently
i
heard
her
bark
and
saw
her
tearing
away
like
mad
as
if
she
had
found
a
rat
or
a
rabbit
i
went
up
to
where
she
was
clawing
and
saw
what
do
you
think
ida
shook
her
head
and
smiled
i
do
know
was
it
a
rabbit
no
responded
wordley
with
suppressed
excitement
it
was
the
top
of
a
tin
box
a
tin
box
echoed
ida
yes
he
said
with
an
emphatic
nod
i
called
jason
to
bring
a
spade
but
i
could
scarcely
wait
and
i
found
myself
clawing
like
like
one
of
the
dogs
my
dear
jason
came
and
we
had
that
box
up
and
i
opened
it
and
what
do
you
think
i
found
ida
shook
her
head
gently
then
she
started
slightly
as
she
remembered
the
night
stafford
and
she
had
watched
her
father
coming
in
his
sleep
from
the
ruined
chapel
something
of
my
father
wordley
nodded
impressively
yes
it
was
something
of
your
father
it
was
a
large
box
my
dear
and
it
contained
what
do
you
think
papers
ventured
ida
securities
my
dear
miss
ida
securities
for
a
very
large
amount
the
box
was
full
of
them
and
a
little
farther
off
we
found
another
tin
case
quite
as
full
they
were
securities
in
some
of
the
best
and
soundest
companies
and
they
are
worth
an
enormous
sum
of
money
ida
stared
at
him
as
if
she
did
not
realise
the
significance
of
his
words
an
enormous
sum
of
money
he
repeated
all
the
while
god
forgive
me
i
was
under
the
impression
that
your
father
was
letting
things
slide
and
was
doing
nothing
to
save
the
estate
and
to
provide
for
you
he
was
speculating
and
investing
and
doing
it
with
a
skill
and
a
shrewdness
which
could
not
have
been
surpassed
by
the
most
astute
and
of
men
his
judgment
was
almost
infallible
he
seems
scarcely
ever
to
have
made
a
mistake
it
was
one
of
those
extraordinary
cases
in
which
everything
a
man
touches
turns
to
gold
there
are
mining
shares
there
which
i
would
not
have
bought
at
a
farthing
a
piece
but
your
father
bought
them
and
they
everyone
of
them
or
nearly
everyone
of
them
turned
up
trumps
some
of
them
which
he
bought
for
a
few
shillings
gold
and
diamond
shares
are
worth
hundreds
of
pounds
hundreds
thousands
my
dear
he
took
her
hand
and
patted
it
as
if
he
were
trying
to
break
the
shock
to
her
your
poor
father
whom
we
all
regarded
as
an
insolvent
actually
died
by
far
and
away
the
richest
man
in
the
county
ida
looked
at
him
as
if
she
did
not
even
yet
quite
understand
she
passed
her
thin
hand
over
her
brow
and
drew
a
long
breath
do
you
mean
do
you
mean
that
i
am
no
longer
poor
mr
wordley
she
asked
wordley
laughed
so
suddenly
and
loudly
that
he
quite
startled
the
hall
porter
in
his
little
glass
box
my
dear
child
he
said
slowly
and
impressively
you
are
rich
not
poor
rich
i
do
not
myself
yet
quite
know
how
much
you
are
worth
but
you
may
take
it
from
me
that
it
a
very
large
sum
indeed
now
you
are
not
going
to
faint
my
dear
for
ida
eyes
had
closed
and
her
hands
had
clasped
each
other
spasmodically
no
no
she
said
in
a
low
voice
but
it
is
so
sudden
so
unexpected
that
i
can
not
realise
it
it
seems
to
me
as
if
i
were
lying
in
the
cot
upstairs
and
dreaming
no
i
can
not
realise
that
i
can
go
back
to
herondale
i
suppose
i
can
go
back
she
asked
with
a
sudden
piteousness
that
very
nearly
brought
the
tears
to
wordley
eyes
go
back
my
dear
he
exclaimed
of
course
you
can
go
back
the
place
belongs
to
you
why
i
already
given
notice
that
i
am
going
to
pay
off
the
mortgages
you
will
get
every
inch
of
the
land
back
you
will
be
the
richest
lady
in
the
county
yes
in
the
whole
county
the
old
glories
of
the
dear
old
house
can
be
revived
you
can
queen
it
there
as
the
herons
of
old
used
to
queen
it
and
everybody
will
be
proud
and
delighted
to
see
you
doing
it
as
for
me
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
i
have
almost
lost
my
head
over
the
business
and
have
behaved
like
a
well
anything
but
like
a
staid
and
sober
old
solicitor
he
laughed
and
blew
his
nose
and
nodded
with
a
shamefaced
joy
which
affected
ida
even
more
than
his
wonderful
news
had
done
how
can
i
thank
you
for
all
your
goodness
to
me
she
murmured
a
little
brokenly
thank
me
do
you
attempt
to
thank
me
or
i
shall
break
down
altogether
for
i
been
the
stupidest
and
most
idiot
that
ever
disgraced
a
noble
profession
i
ought
to
have
seen
through
your
father
affectation
of
miserliness
and
indifference
anybody
but
a
silly
old
numskull
would
have
done
so
but
my
dear
why
are
we
staying
here
why
do
we
go
away
at
once
you
like
to
go
back
to
herondale
by
the
first
train
you
must
hate
the
sight
of
this
place
i
should
think
no
no
said
ida
gently
yes
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
herondale
ah
yes
as
soon
as
possible
but
i
should
like
to
see
someone
before
i
go
the
sister
the
nurse
who
have
been
so
good
to
me
you
are
sure
she
paused
and
went
on
shyly
you
are
sure
there
is
no
mistake
that
i
have
some
money
am
rich
rich
as
croesus
my
dear
child
he
responded
with
a
laugh
she
blushed
still
more
deeply
then
have
you
have
you
any
money
with
you
wordley
i
mean
quite
a
large
sum
of
money
not
a
very
large
sum
my
dear
he
replied
rather
puzzled
about
twenty
or
thirty
pounds
perhaps
ida
face
fell
oh
that
is
not
nearly
enough
she
murmured
eh
he
asked
but
i
got
my
with
me
how
much
do
you
want
and
forgive
me
my
dear
miss
ida
but
may
i
ask
what
you
want
it
for
can
i
have
a
cheque
for
five
hundred
pounds
ida
asked
timidly
five
thousand
fifty
thousand
my
dear
he
responded
promptly
and
with
no
little
pride
and
satisfaction
five
hundred
will
do
for
the
present
she
said
a
little
nervously

the
porter
will
let
you
draw
it
out

puzzled

into
the
porter
box
and
took
out
his
make

payable
to
the
hospital
and
give
it
to
me

ida
in
a
low
voice
the
old
man
face
cleared
and
he
nodded
of
course

course

dear

have

that
good
grateful
heart
of

above

beyond
myself
that

want

should
fall
to
dancing
in
the
hall
and
so
disgrace
myself
and
the
noble
profession
to
which
i
belong
with
the
folded
cheque
in
her
hand
ida
took
him
up
the
many
stone
steps
to
the
alexandra
ward
the
sister
who
had
parted
from
her
so
reluctantly
was
naturally
surprised
to
see
her
return
so
soon
and
accompanied
by
a
fatherly
and
prosperous
old
gentleman
who
kept
close
to
her
as
if
he
were
afraid
she
might
be
spirited
from
him
i
have
come
back
to
to
say
again
sister
said
ida
her
voice
faltering
a
little
but
her
eyes
beaming
as
they
had
not
beamed
for
many
a
day
and
i
want
to
give
you
something
something
for
the
hospital
it
is
from
my
dear
friend
here
wordley
who
has
just
found
me
and
i
want
you
not
to
open
it
until
we
have
gone
say
for
half
an
hour
and
i
am
going
to
write
to
you
as
i
promised
and
you
can
write
to
me
if
you
will
be
so
kind
for
i
can
give
you
the
address
now
it
is
on
the
back
of
the
cheque
she
had
written
it
in
the
porter
box
i
am
going
home
something
has
happened
but
i
will
write
and
tell
you
now
i
can
only
say
her
voice
broke
and
trembled
again
and
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
she
drew
the
sister
to
her
and
kissed
her
and
wordley
shook
the
sister
hand
and
blew
his
nose
so
loudly
that
the
patients
who
had
been
watching
them
eagerly
nodded
to
each
other
and
exchanged
significant
glances
and
there
was
a
suppressed
excitement
in
the
ward
which
found
adequate
expression
when
half
an
hour
afterwards
the
sister
with
flashed
cheek
and
quavering
voice
made
them
acquainted
with
ida
gift
and
now
said
wordley
after
he
had
shaken
hands
with
several
of
the
officials
including
the
porter
and
now
my
dear
miss
ida
for
herondale
and
home
hi
cab
chapter
xxxviii
the
journey
down
to
herondale
can
not
be
described
whenever
ida
thought
of
it
in
the
after
years
she
felt
herself
trembling
and
quivering
with
the
memory
of
it
until
she
had
sat
in
the
carriage
and
the
train
had
started
and
she
realised
that
she
was
indeed
going
home
home
she
did
not
know
what
it
had
cost
her
to
leave
herondale
how
much
she
had
suffered
at
laburnum
villa
how
deep
the
iron
of
dependence
had
entered
her
soul
she
was
all
of
a
quiver
with
delight
with
profound
gratitude
to
the
providence
which
was
restoring
her
to
the
old
house
the
wide
moors
the
brawling
streams
which
she
knew
now
were
dearer
to
her
than
life
itself
wordley
understood
and
was
full
of
sympathy
with
her
mood
he
bought
newspapers
and
magazines
and
he
let
her
alone
and
pretended
to
read
but
every
now
and
then
she
met
his
smiling
glance
and
knew
by
his
nod
of
the
head
that
he
was
rejoicing
with
her
he
had
wired
for
a
carriage
and
pair
to
meet
them
at
bryndermere
and
ida
leant
back
and
tried
to
be
patient
then
to
look
unconcerned
and
calm
and
composed
but
she
uttered
a
little
cry
and
nearly
broke
down
when
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
familiar
gate
and
jessie
who
was
standing
there
with
her
hair
blown
wild
by
the
wind
forgot
the
inequalities
of
their
positions
and
catching
her
beloved
young
mistress
to
her
bosom
crooned
and
sobbed
over
her
jason
stood
just
behind
balancing
himself
first
on
one
foot
and
then
on
the
other
in
his
efforts
to
get
a
glimpse
of
ida
and
she
stretched
out
her
arm
over
jessee
shoulder
and
shook
the
honest
hand
which
had
grown
hard
and
horny
in
her
service
jessie
almost
carried
her
mistress
into
the
hall
where
a
huge
fire
was
burning
and
threw
a
red
and
cheerful
glow
over
the
fading
gilding
and
hangings
oh
miss
how
thin
you
be
she
said
at
last
as
with
clasped
hands
she
surveyed
ida
from
top
to
toe
anxiously
and
greedily
wherever
have
you
been
to
look
like
that
but
never
mind
miss
ida
you
back
and
that
everything
and
we
very
soon
get
some
flesh
on
your
bones
and
drive
the
sad
look
out
of
thee
eyes
in
moments
of
emotion
and
excitement
jessie
forgot
the
schooling
ida
had
given
her
and
lapsed
into
you
missed
the
moorland
air
dearie
and
the
cream
and
the
milk
i
it
all
chalk
and
water
in
london
and
i
suppose
there
was
room
to
ride
in
them
crowded
streets
and
the
food
too
i
told
it
ai
fit
for
ordinary
humans
leave
alone
a
dainty
maid
like
my
sweet
mistress
yes
you
shall
fatten
me
to
your
heart
desire
jessie
said
ida
i
suppose
i
do
look
of
much
account
i
been
ill
but
i
shall
soon
get
well
i
felt
as
we
drove
along
the
moor
with
the
wind
blowing
on
my
cheek
as
if
i
had
not
breathed
since
the
hour
i
left
and
now
tell
me
everything
all
at
once
rupert
there
no
need
to
ask
about
the
dogs
donald
and
bess
had
not
yet
ceased
to
tear
at
her
in
frantic
efforts
to
express
their
delight
are
you
glad
i
come
back
donald
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
as
she
knelt
and
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
nestled
her
face
against
his
and
let
him
lick
her
with
his
great
soft
tongue
ah
if
you
are
only
half
as
glad
as
i
am
doggie
your
heart
must
be
half
breaking
with
the
joy
of
it
and
if
lean
you
are
disgracefully
fat
bess
do
tell
me
you
missed
me
for
i
do
believe
it
it
was
some
time
before
jessie
could
drag
her
upstairs
and
the
sight
of
her
old
room
as
cheerful
as
the
hall
with
the
huge
fire
almost
unnerved
her
and
when
she
was
alone
she
sank
upon
her
knees
beside
the
bed
in
a
thanksgiving
which
was
none
the
less
deep
and
fervent
for
its
muteness
when
she
came
down
the
dinner
was
ready
and
wordley
was
standing
in
front
of
the
fire
awaiting
her
she
was
glad
that
jason
had
not
had
time
to
procure
a
new
livery
was
glad
of
the
old
shabbiness
of
the
room
that
its
aspect
was
not
yet
changed
and
that
it
greeted
her
with
all
its
old
familiarity
wordley
would
not
let
her
talk
until
she
had
made
at
any
rate
a
pretense
of
eating
but
when
they
had
gone
into
the
he
drew
a
chair
to
the
fire
for
her
and
said
now
my
dear
i
am
afraid
i
shall
have
to
talk
business
i
shall
be
too
busy
to
come
over
he
laughed
you
see
i
have
left
all
my
other
clients
affairs
to
come
after
my
stray
lamb
i
expect
i
shall
find
them
in
a
pretty
muddle
now
my
dear
before
i
go
i
should
like
you
to
tell
me
exactly
what
you
would
like
to
do
as
i
have
explained
to
you
you
are
now
the
mistress
of
a
very
large
fortune
with
which
you
can
do
absolutely
what
you
like
would
you
like
to
live
here
or
would
you
like
to
take
a
house
in
london
or
go
abroad
ida
looked
up
a
little
piteously
oh
not
go
to
london
or
abroad
she
said
can
i
not
live
here
if
you
knew
how
i
feel
how
the
sight
of
the
place
the
thought
that
i
am
under
the
old
roof
again
she
looked
round
the
faded
stately
room
lovingly
wistfully
and
wordley
nodded
sympathetically
of
course
you
can
my
dear
he
said
but
equally
o
course
you
will
now
want
to
restore
the
old
place
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
done
and
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
would
like
to
go
away
while
the
work
was
being
carried
on
ida
shook
her
head
no
i
would
like
to
stay
even
if
i
have
to
live
in
the
kitchen
or
one
of
the
garrets
it
will
be
a
delight
to
me
to
watch
the
men
at
work
i
should
never
grow
tired
of
it
i
quite
understand
my
dear
he
said
i
honour
you
for
that
feeling
well
then
i
shall
engage
an
architect
of
repute
the
first
in
his
profession
he
rubbed
his
hands
with
an
air
of
enjoyment
and
he
shall
restore
the
old
place
with
a
respect
and
reverence
i
think
i
know
the
man
to
employ
and
we
will
start
at
once
so
that
no
time
may
be
lost
i
want
to
see
you
settled
in
your
proper
position
here
the
thought
of
it
gives
me
a
new
lease
of
life
of
course
you
will
want
a
proper
establishment
more
servants
both
in
the
house
and
out
of
it
you
will
want
carriages
and
horses
both
the
lodges
must
be
rebuilt
and
the
old
avenue
opened
out
and
put
in
order
heron
hall
was
one
of
the
finest
places
in
the
county
and
it
shall
be
so
again
and
jessie
shall
be
the
housekeeper
and
jason
the
butler
said
ida
with
a
laugh
of
almost
enjoyment
oh
it
all
seems
like
a
dream
and
i
feel
that
at
any
moment
i
may
wake
and
find
myself
at
laburnum
villa
and
oh
wordley
i
shall
want
some
more
money
at
once
i
want
to
send
the
herons
a
present
a
really
nice
present
that
will
help
them
i
hope
to
forget
the
trouble
i
caused
them
poor
people
it
was
not
their
fault
they
did
not
understand
wordley
snorted
there
is
one
topic
of
conversation
my
dear
miss
ida
i
shall
be
compelled
to
bar
he
said
i
never
want
to
hear
john
heron
name
again
as
to
sending
them
a
present
you
can
of
course
send
them
anything
you
like
to
the
half
of
your
kingdom
though
if
you
ask
me
whether
they
deserve
it
i
did
ask
you
said
ida
with
a
laugh
putting
her
hand
on
his
arm
if
we
all
got
our
deserts
how
sad
it
would
be
for
everyone
of
us
wordley
grunted
i
shall
pay
a
sum
of
money
into
the
bank
for
you
and
you
will
have
to
drive
over
and
get
a
and
you
can
amuse
yourself
by
drawing
cheques
until
i
come
again
he
lingered
as
long
as
he
could
and
kept
the
carriage
waiting
some
time
but
at
last
he
went
and
ida
was
left
alone
to
face
the
strange
change
in
her
fortune
she
sat
before
the
fire
dreaming
for
a
few
minutes
then
she
wandered
over
the
old
house
from
room
to
room
and
every
room
had
its
memories
and
associations
for
her
in
the
library
she
could
almost
fancy
that
her
father
was
sitting
in
the
chair
which
was
still
drawn
up
in
its
place
to
the
table
and
she
went
and
sat
in
it
and
touched
with
reverent
loving
hand
the
books
and
papers
over
which
he
had
been
wont
to
bend
she
stood
before
his
portrait
and
gazed
at
it
with
eyes
and
only
the
consciousness
of
the
love
she
had
borne
him
enabled
her
to
bear
his
absence
as
she
passed
through
the
hall
the
newly
risen
moon
was
pouring
in
through
the
tall
window
and
followed
by
donald
and
bess
who
had
not
left
her
for
a
moment
she
opened
the
great
hall
door
and
went
on
to
the
terrace
and
walking
to
the
end
stood
and
looked
towards
the
ruined
chapel
in
which
her
father
had
buried
his
treasure
up
to
this
moment
she
had
been
buoyed
up
by
excitement
and
the
joy
and
pleasure
of
her
return
to
the
old
house
but
suddenly
there
fell
a
depression
upon
her
she
was
conscious
of
an
aching
void
a
lack
of
something
which
robbed
her
heart
of
all
its
joy
she
had
no
need
to
ask
herself
what
it
was
she
knew
too
well
her
old
home
had
come
back
to
her
she
was
the
mistress
of
a
large
fortune
she
stood
as
it
were
bathed
in
the
sunshine
of
prosperity
but
her
heart
fell
cold
and
dead
and
the
sunshine
bright
as
it
was
dazzling
indeed
had
no
warmth
in
it
she
was
a
great
heiress
now
would
no
doubt
soon
be
surrounded
by
friends
she
had
been
poor
and
friendless
that
day
stafford
had
taken
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
for
the
first
time
but
ah
how
happy
she
had
been
was
it
possible
could
fate
be
so
cruel
as
to
decree
that
she
should
never
be
happy
again
never
lose
the
aching
pain
which
racked
her
heart
at
every
thought
of
him
she
put
the
fear
from
her
with
a
feeling
of
shame
and
helplessness
she
forget
the
man
who
left
her
for
another
woman
would
not
let
thought
of
him
cast
a
shadow
over
her
life
and
dominate
it
no
doubt
by
this
time
he
had
quite
forgotten
her
or
if
he
remembered
her
recalled
the
past
with
a
feeling
of
annoyance
with
which
a
man
regards
a
passing
flirtation
pleasant
enough
while
it
lasted
but
of
which
he
did
well
to
be
a
little
ashamed
she
would
not
look
in
the
direction
of
the
trees
under
which
he
had
stood
on
the
night
of
the
day
she
had
first
seen
him
and
she
went
in
with
a
forced
cheerfulness
to
tell
jessie
listening
with
eyes
of
some
of
the
strange
things
which
had
happened
to
her
all
the
time
she
was
talking
she
was
beset
by
a
longing
to
ask
jessie
about
brae
wood
and
the
ormes
but
she
crushed
down
the
idea
and
jessie
was
too
intent
upon
hearing
the
story
of
her
mistress
sojourn
in
london
to
have
any
breath
or
inclination
to
tell
any
of
the
dale
news
of
course
ida
did
not
speak
of
the
disagreement
at
laburnum
villa
but
she
gave
jessie
an
account
of
the
accident
and
her
experiences
of
a
hospital
ward
at
all
which
jessie
uttered
ohs
and
ahs
with
bated
breath
and
gaping
month
it
was
late
before
ida
got
to
bed
and
later
still
before
she
fell
asleep
for
somehow
now
that
she
was
back
at
herondale
the
memory
of
that
happy
past
grew
more
vivid
in
fact
the
whole
place
was
haunted
by
the
spectre
of
her
lost
love
and
of
all
spectres
this
is
the
most
sad
and
she
was
out
on
rupert
as
early
as
possible
the
next
morning
and
it
was
difficult
to
say
which
was
the
more
pleased
at
the
reunion
he
or
his
mistress
and
oh
what
a
delight
it
was
to
ride
across
the
moor
and
along
the
valley
and
by
the
stream
to
see
the
cattle
grazing
and
to
hear
the
sheep
calling
to
one
another
in
the
old
plaintive
way
it
was
almost
difficult
to
believe
that
she
had
ever
left
herondale
that
laburnum
villa
was
anything
but
a
nightmare
and
the
herons
a
dismal
unreality
now
for
some
time
she
avoided
that
part
of
the
road
where
the
opening
of
the
plantation
gave
a
view
of
the
villa
but
she
was
drawn
towards
it
at
last
and
she
leant
forward
on
her
horse
and
looked
across
the
lake
at
the
great
white
place
shining
in
the
autumn
sunlight
it
seemed
very
still
and
quiet
and
there
was
no
sign
of
life
about
the
place
the
lake
itself
was
deserted
save
by
one
of
the
steamers
on
which
were
only
a
few
passengers
well
against
the
now
keen
air
the
appearance
of
the
white
place
struck
her
with
a
sense
of
desertion
and
desolation
and
with
a
sigh
she
turned
and
rode
away
that
afternoon
as
she
was
coming
in
from
the
stable
jessie
came
running
towards
her
oh
miss
ida
there
lord
and
lady
bannerdale
and
lady
vayne
and
two
of
the
young
ladies
in
the
very
well
said
ida
quietly
and
removing
her
gauntlet
she
went
straight
into
the
in
accordance
with
her
father
wish
and
her
own
perhaps
mistaken
pride
she
had
avoided
all
these
people
hitherto
but
there
was
no
need
to
avoid
them
any
longer
she
was
their
equal
in
birth
and
her
newly
discovered
wealth
effectually
removed
any
cause
for
pride
lady
bannerdale
a
motherly
and
woman
came
forward
to
meet
her
and
took
her
by
both
hands
my
dear
we
have
come
over
at
once
to
tell
you
how
glad
we
are
she
said
we
heard
the
good
news
from
wordley
and
neither
i
nor
my
husband
could
wait
another
day
before
we
came
to
congratulate
you
lady
vayne
too
held
ida
hand
and
looked
at
her
with
affectionate
sympathy
and
we
felt
the
same
my
dear
she
said
so
you
must
not
think
us
intrusive
ida
shook
hands
with
them
all
and
rang
for
the
tea
she
was
very
quiet
and
subdued
but
the
little
cold
look
of
surprise
with
which
she
had
at
one
time
met
their
advances
was
now
absent
and
they
could
perceive
that
she
was
glad
to
see
them
our
joy
in
the
good
news
is
not
altogether
unselfish
and
disinterested
my
dear
miss
ida
said
lord
bannerdale
that
heron
hall
should
be
shut
up
and
deserted
while
there
is
so
charming
a
mistress
to
represent
the
old
family
was
little
short
of
a
general
misfortune
you
can
not
tell
how
anxious
and
concerned
we
have
been
about
you
but
we
will
say
no
more
about
that
i
trust
a
brighter
star
has
risen
above
the
old
house
and
that
it
is
entering
upon
brighter
fortunes
at
any
rate
let
that
be
as
it
may
we
want
you
to
believe
how
delighted
we
are
to
have
you
back
again
and
under
such
happy
auspices
and
we
want
to
say
too
dear
said
lady
bannerdale
while
lady
vayne
nodded
assentingly
that
we
hope
you
have
really
come
back
to
us
that
you
will
be
one
of
us
and
let
us
see
a
great
deal
of
you
of
course
under
the
circumstances
she
glanced
at
ida
black
dress
we
are
debarred
from
expressing
our
pleasure
in
festivity
but
we
hope
you
will
come
to
us
quite
quietly
and
very
often
and
that
you
will
let
us
treat
you
as
one
of
our
own
dear
girls
ida
murmured
a
suitable
response
but
though
she
was
by
no
means
demonstrative
they
were
satisfied
and
as
they
left
they
expressed
that
satisfaction
to
each
other
oh
yes
she
was
glad
to
see
us
lady
bannerdale
said
and
i
like
her
all
the
better
for
not
meeting
us
and
for
refraining
from
any
gushing
poor
girl
i
am
afraid
she
has
been
very
ill
and
has
felt
her
trouble
very
keenly
she
is
much
thinner
and
when
she
came
into
the
room
there
was
an
expression
in
her
face
which
touched
me
and
made
my
eyes
dim
we
must
look
after
her
remarked
lady
vayne
there
is
something
weird
in
the
idea
of
her
living
there
all
alone
though
of
course
her
maid
jessie
will
take
care
of
her
lady
bannerdale
smiled
ida
heron
is
one
of
those
girls
who
are
quite
capable
of
taking
care
of
themselves
she
said
how
wonderfully
calm
and
she
was
most
girls
would
have
been
rather
upset
or
at
any
rate
a
little
flurried
meeting
us
all
so
unexpectedly
but
she
came
into
the
room
with
the
perfect
which
marks
the
lady
finished
lord
bannerdale
i
wonder
whether
we
realise
how
old
a
family
the
herons
is
we
are
all
mushrooms
compared
with
that
slim
little
girl
who
is
now
the
mistress
of
herondale
and
an
enormous
fortune
we
shall
have
to
find
a
husband
for
her
remarked
lady
vayne
who
was
the
of
the
locality
lord
bannerdale
smiled
the
trouble
would
be
to
get
miss
ida
to
accept
him
when
you
have
found
him
he
said
shrewdly
i
have
an
idea
she
would
be
difficult
to
please
there
is
a
little
curl
to
those
pretty
lips
of
hers
which
is
tolerably
significant
poor
girl
there
is
time
enough
yet
to
think
of
such
a
thing
said
lady
bannerdale
reprovingly
but
while
she
sat
it
she
thought
that
her
son
edwin
would
be
home
from
a
long
tour
in
the
east
in
a
week
or
two
that
he
was
particularly
and
in
the
opinion
of
more
persons
than
his
mother
a
particularly
amiable
and
good
fellow
the
next
day
there
were
more
visitors
they
all
seemed
as
genuinely
glad
at
her
return
and
they
all
made
as
genuine
overtures
of
friendship
it
was
evident
that
ida
need
not
be
alone
in
the
world
any
longer
unless
she
wished
to
be
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
as
she
was
riding
to
bryndermere
with
some
shopping
as
an
excuse
she
met
wordley
a
gentleman
was
sitting
beside
him
who
ida
guessed
was
the
architect
he
proved
to
be
no
less
a
personage
than
the
famous
hartley
they
had
pulled
up
for
the
introduction
close
by
the
opening
on
the
lake
and
while
the
architect
was
exchanging
greetings
with
ida
his
keen
eyes
wandered
now
and
again
to
the
villa
and
as
ida
turned
to
ride
back
with
them
he
said
that
is
rather
a
fine
place
over
there
miss
heron
rather
bizarre
and
conspicuous
but
striking
and
rather
artistic
new
too
whose
is
it
stephen
orme
place
replied
wordley
in
rather
a
low
voice
oh
said
hartley
with
a
nod
which
struck
ida
as
being
peculiarly
expressive
and
significant
though
she
did
not
know
what
it
implied
the
three
went
all
over
the
old
hall
and
after
lunch
the
great
architect
explained
with
the
aid
of
a
sheet
of
paper
and
a
pencil
his
idea
of
what
should
be
done
there
need
not
be
there
should
not
be
the
least
addition
he
said
what
you
want
to
do
miss
heron
is
as
wordley
says
restore
restore
with
all
reverence
it
is
a
superb
piece
of
architecture
of
its
kind
and
it
must
be
touched
with
a
gentle
hand
if
you
are
prepared
to
leave
it
all
to
me
i
trust
i
may
be
able
to
make
the
present
building
worthy
of
its
past
it
will
be
a
delightful
task
for
me
but
i
must
tell
you
frankly
that
it
will
cost
a
very
large
sum
of
money
how
much
i
shall
be
able
to
inform
you
when
i
have
got
out
my
plans
and
gone
into
the
estimate
but
at
any
rate
i
can
say
emphatically
that
the
place
is
worth
the
expenditure
am
i
to
have
yes
said
ida
i
will
leave
it
entirely
in
your
hands
this
at
least
she
could
do
with
the
money
which
her
father
had
so
mysteriously
made
restore
it
the
house
he
had
loved
so
well
well
to
its
old
dignity
and
grandeur
the
great
architect
very
much
impressed
not
only
by
the
hall
but
its
beautiful
young
mistress
left
before
wordley
who
wanted
to
talk
over
business
with
ida
but
he
found
her
rather
and
preoccupied
and
presently
in
a
pause
she
said
with
forced
calmness
is
sir
stephen
orme
still
at
the
villa
at
brae
wood
mr
wordley
he
had
been
making
some
memoranda
in
his
and
he
looked
up
with
a
start
and
stared
at
her
is
sir
stephen
my
dear
child
do
you
know
have
you
heard
heard
what
she
asked
her
face
beginning
to
grow
paler
her
lips
set
tightly
god
bless
my
soul
i
surprised
he
exclaimed
i
thought
everybody
had
heard
the
news
sir
stephen
is
not
living
at
the
villa
for
a
very
grave
and
reason
he
is
dead
my
dear
ida
leant
back
in
her
chair
and
raised
a
screen
which
she
held
in
her
hand
so
that
it
shielded
her
face
from
his
gaze
i
did
not
know
she
said
in
a
very
low
voice
i
had
not
heard
i
have
not
seen
any
papers
or
if
i
have
only
the
advertisement
part
dead
yes
said
wordley
poor
man
he
died
suddenly
quite
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
a
grand
ball
died
of
the
shock
shock
she
echoed
he
looked
at
her
as
if
he
found
it
hard
to
realise
her
ignorance
yes
the
shock
of
the
bad
news
dear
me
it
seems
so
strange
that
you
a
neighbour
so
to
speak
should
not
have
heard
the
story
of
which
all
london
one
might
almost
say
all
england
was
talking
sir
stephen
was
a
great
financier
and
had
just
brought
out
a
great
company
to
work
an
important
concession
in
africa
he
was
supposed
to
have
made
an
enormous
sum
of
money
by
it
indeed
must
have
done
so
but
at
the
very
moment
of
his
success
there
came
a
stroke
of
bad
luck
and
the
news
of
it
was
brought
to
him
on
the
night
of
the
ball
he
was
giving
in
his
splendid
town
house
the
sudden
reverse
meant
absolute
ruin
and
he
fell
dead
with
the
cablegram
in
his
hand
shocking
was
it
not
ida
lips
moved
but
she
could
not
speak
the
whole
scene
seemed
to
rise
before
her
but
naturally
enough
her
thoughts
were
concentrated
upon
one
figure
in
it
that
of
stafford
then
then
stafford
orme
is
now
the
baronet
sir
stafford
she
said
in
a
scarcely
audible
voice
no
he
is
now
lord
highcliffe
his
father
was
raised
to
the
peerage
on
the
day
he
died
one
night
almost
say
the
hour
he
died
that
makes
it
the
more
unfortunate
unfortunate
i
do
not
understand
you
say
he
is
a
peer
yes
but
a
penniless
peer
and
i
ca
imagine
a
more
unpleasant
and
miserable
position
than
his
his
father
died
absolutely
ruined
indeed
insolvent
though
i
suppose
by
his
son
act
of
noble
a
great
many
of
the
debts
were
paid
tell
me
i
do
not
know
said
ida
as
steadily
as
she
could
sir
stephen
settled
a
very
large
sum
of
money
upon
the
young
man
but
he
refused
to
take
advantage
of
it
and
made
over
the
whole
sum
every
penny
of
it
to
the
creditors
and
left
himself
i
am
told
absolutely
penniless
not
that
it
mattered
very
much
because
he
is
engaged
to
a
miss
falconer
who
father
is
i
believe
a
millionaire
the
colour
rose
to
ida
face
the
hand
which
held
the
screen
shook
and
they
they
are
going
to
be
married
soon
asked
she
i
do
know
i
suppose
not
replied
wordley
as
he
bent
over
his
memoranda
again
lord
highcliffe
has
disappeared
left
england
no
one
seems
to
quite
know
where
he
has
gone
it
was
a
terrible
collapse
and
a
tragic
end
the
great
sir
stephen
but
men
of
his
trade
always
have
to
run
such
risks
by
the
way
i
suppose
the
villa
will
have
to
be
sold
sold
echoed
ida
i
would
like
to
buy
it
she
spoke
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
but
wordley
did
not
seem
at
all
surprised
and
only
smiled
as
he
responded
i
know
no
reason
why
you
should
not
my
dear
miss
ida
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
be
a
good
investment
but
if
you
a
fancy
for
it
i
will
enquire
into
the
matter
yes
certainly
you
can
buy
if
you
want
to
do
so
long
after
he
had
gone
ida
sat
leaning
forward
in
her
chair
and
gazing
at
the
fire
stafford
was
now
lord
highcliffe
a
peer
but
poor
and
a
wanderer
she
started
was
it
really
he
whom
she
had
seen
on
the
cattle
steamer
then
they
had
been
near
each
other
had
looked
into
each
other
eyes
perhaps
she
would
never
seem
him
again
but
ah
yes
it
was
quite
probable
she
would
for
was
he
not
engaged
to
the
wealthy
miss
falconer
and
would
he
not
come
back
to
marry
her
the
following
evening
she
received
a
short
note
from
wordley
it
informed
her
that
the
villa
was
not
for
sale
it
had
been
purchased
by
falconer
for
his
daughter
chapter
xxxix
within
a
few
days
she
received
invitations
from
the
bannerdales
and
vaynes
and
the
other
county
families
who
were
evidently
possessed
by
the
kind
determination
that
she
should
become
one
of
them
the
dinner
at
bannerdale
grange
was
quite
she
was
made
a
great
deal
of
and
if
she
had
given
them
the
least
encouragement
they
would
actually
have
petted
her
but
though
ida
had
lost
something
of
her
old
pride
and
caused
by
her
isolation
she
was
still
somewhat
reserved
and
grateful
as
she
was
for
their
overtures
of
affection
she
could
not
respond
as
fully
as
she
would
have
liked
it
was
the
same
with
the
vaynes
and
avorys
they
were
all
more
than
kind
to
her
and
she
longed
to
receive
their
attention
with
open
arms
but
she
could
not
the
fact
was
her
wounded
heart
was
so
tender
that
it
shrank
even
from
the
gentlest
touch
the
girl
is
all
right
remarked
lord
bannerdale
she
has
been
in
great
trouble
and
it
has
hurt
her
very
badly
and
though
she
seems
rather
cold
and
reserved
she
is
more
sensitive
than
most
women
you
must
give
her
time
ida
had
resolved
that
though
she
could
not
altogether
forget
the
great
sorrow
of
her
life
she
would
not
brood
over
it
she
knew
that
for
her
complaint
there
was
nothing
worse
than
idleness
and
she
sought
employment
for
her
mind
and
body
with
an
eagerness
that
sometimes
became
almost
feverish
when
she
was
not
visiting
or
receiving
visits
from
what
might
be
called
her
new
friends
she
was
busy
about
the
farm
and
the
estate
and
took
long
rides
on
rupert
accompanied
as
of
old
by
the
dogs
very
soon
too
hartley
began
at
the
restoration
and
ida
was
deeply
interested
in
the
progress
of
the
work
then
again
the
hunting
season
commenced
and
to
the
delight
of
sir
robert
vayne
the
master
she
appeared
at
the
first
meet
and
is
it
necessary
to
say
was
in
at
the
death
she
enjoyed
that
first
run
more
than
she
had
enjoyed
anything
since
the
fatal
morning
she
had
lost
both
sweetheart
and
father
and
she
was
very
nearly
happy
as
she
rode
home
with
a
crushed
hat
and
a
habit
splashed
with
mud
a
week
or
two
afterwards
lord
bannerdale
gave
a
hunt
breakfast
and
made
a
point
of
her
being
present
and
she
yielded
though
she
would
have
preferred
to
have
joined
the
meet
at
the
coverts
as
she
rode
up
lord
bannerdale
came
down
the
steps
to
meet
her
and
by
his
side
was
a
tall
young
fellow
whom
ida
rightly
guessed
by
his
likeness
to
his
father
to
be
lord
bannerdale
son
he
had
returned
from
his
travels
on
the
preceding
night
was
in
perfect
health
and
spirits
much
tanned
by
the
sun
and
rain
and
seemed
to
possess
his
full
share
of
the
amiability
of
his
amiable
family
he
stood
at
rupert
head
and
took
ida
hand
to
help
her
to
dismount
and
not
only
walked
with
her
to
the
house
but
contrived
to
sit
beside
her
at
the
his
people
had
been
talking
to
him
of
ida
he
was
quite
prepared
to
be
impressed
and
that
he
was
so
was
evident
before
the
meal
had
concluded
his
mother
paid
particular
attention
to
ida
and
lord
bannerdale
regarded
the
young
pair
approvingly
lord
edwin
rode
as
straight
as
ida
herself
it
was
a
magnificent
run
of
course
the
best
run
of
the
season
and
lord
edwin
securing
the
brush
fastened
it
to
her
saddle
those
who
saw
the
act
they
were
not
many
for
the
pace
had
been
fast
and
hard
exchanged
significant
glances
lord
edwin
was
over
at
the
hall
next
day
and
displayed
a
keen
interest
in
the
restoration
and
bent
for
some
time
over
the
plans
which
he
had
humbly
begged
ida
to
show
him
he
was
a
modest
young
fellow
with
more
intelligence
and
good
sense
than
generally
goes
with
his
age
and
ida
liked
him
it
was
inevitable
that
they
should
meet
almost
every
day
it
was
almost
as
inevitable
that
he
should
fall
in
love
with
her
for
she
was
not
only
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
county
but
there
was
an
element
of
romance
in
her
loneliness
and
her
fortunes
which
naturally
appealed
to
him
he
went
to
his
father
one
day
and
confided
in
him
but
though
lord
and
lady
bannerdale
were
more
than
pleased
they
begged
him
not
to
be
too
sanguine
sanguine
he
exclaimed
colouring
i
live
in
a
state
of
mortal
fear
and
dread
for
though
i
love
her
more
every
time
i
see
her
i
never
leave
her
without
feeling
that
my
case
is
hopeless
there
is
something
about
ida
oh
of
course
i
ca
explain
but
i
feel
as
if
i
could
no
more
speak
to
her
of
love
than
i
could
could
jump
over
this
house
and
yet
she
is
so
gentle
and
friendly
said
lady
bannerdale
to
encourage
him
the
young
fellow
wise
in
his
generation
shook
his
head
that
just
it
mother
he
said
gravely
she
treats
me
as
if
i
were
a
brother
quite
a
young
brother
and
i
know
that
if
i
were
to
speak
to
her
to
let
her
know
how
much
i
love
her
it
would
mean
the
end
of
everything
i
should
never
be
able
to
see
her
again
and
i
could
not
stand
that
for
i
am
only
happy
when
i
am
with
her
and
then
i
am
miserable
with
the
thought
of
having
to
leave
her
you
must
be
patient
my
dear
fellow
said
lord
bannerdale
ida
heron
is
a
girl
in
a
million
and
she
is
worth
waiting
for
oh
i
wait
said
lord
edwin
but
sometimes
i
feel
that
all
the
waiting
in
the
world
wo
win
her
he
added
with
a
sigh
one
day
it
was
in
the
christmas
week
which
ida
had
been
prevailed
upon
to
spend
with
the
bannerdales
lord
bannerdale
came
in
at
with
some
news
i
hear
the
villa
is
to
be
occupied
at
christmas
he
said
falconer
and
his
daughter
are
coming
down
is
there
to
be
a
said
lady
bannerdale
but
i
suppose
not
no
there
could
not
be
under
the
circumstances
poor
girl
sir
stephen
death
i
never
can
remember
that
he
was
lord
highcliffe
must
have
been
a
great
grief
and
shock
to
her
she
and
her
father
will
naturally
wish
to
be
quiet
but
i
suppose
we
ought
to
call
you
have
never
seen
her
i
think
ida
no
said
ida
in
the
impassive
reticent
way
in
which
she
always
spoke
and
looked
when
on
guard
an
extremely
beautiful
woman
said
lady
bannerdale
but
she
always
struck
me
as
being
a
remarkably
cold
one
though
of
course
it
may
have
only
been
manner
the
present
lord
highcliffe
sir
stephen
son
has
been
away
some
time
now
i
suppose
he
will
come
back
soon
and
they
will
be
married
they
will
make
a
very
handsome
couple
you
would
like
him
edwin
i
took
a
great
fancy
to
him
on
the
few
occasions
i
met
him
and
i
felt
deeply
sorry
for
his
misfortunes
but
there
will
be
no
lack
of
money
when
he
and
miss
falconer
are
married
for
her
father
is
immensely
rich
i
believe
it
would
be
very
nice
for
all
of
us
if
lord
highcliffe
settled
at
the
villa
and
i
have
an
idea
that
falconer
has
bought
it
for
them
ida
heart
sank
and
she
seized
the
first
opportunity
of
getting
to
her
own
room
what
hope
of
forgetfulness
could
there
be
for
her
what
chance
of
happiness
if
stafford
came
back
to
the
villa
to
live
if
she
should
be
in
hourly
dread
of
meeting
him
the
thought
haunted
her
though
all
the
quiet
christmas
festivities
at
the
grange
and
she
was
glad
to
get
back
to
the
hall
and
away
from
the
eyes
which
watched
her
though
they
watched
her
with
a
friendly
and
affectionate
regard
in
her
daily
rides
she
avoided
the
opening
on
the
lake
side
from
which
the
villa
was
visible
and
she
would
sometimes
make
a
long
rather
than
go
near
the
spot
on
one
occasion
when
returning
from
bryndermere
instead
of
crossing
by
the
ferry
she
rode
round
by
the
other
side
of
the
lake
keeping
well
away
from
the
villa
lest
she
should
meet
anyone
belonging
to
it
she
had
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
below
which
wound
the
road
leading
to
the
hall
and
after
pausing
to
look
at
the
magnificent
view
was
riding
across
a
field
one
of
the
outlying
fields
of
her
estate
when
she
saw
a
lady
riding
through
a
gate
at
the
lower
end
the
blood
rushed
to
her
face
and
her
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
for
a
moment
for
she
saw
that
it
was
maude
falconer
then
her
face
grew
pale
and
a
wave
of
bitterness
grew
over
her
for
she
recognised
the
horse
on
which
maude
was
riding
it
was
stafford
adonis
her
first
impulse
was
to
turn
aside
and
leave
the
field
but
her
pride
revolted
and
she
kept
her
course
looking
straight
before
her
and
trying
not
to
see
the
graceful
figure
below
her
at
sight
of
her
the
blood
had
flown
to
maude
face
also
and
she
tried
to
check
her
horse
but
adonis
at
any
time
rather
more
than
she
could
well
manage
was
fresh
and
too
eager
to
join
the
other
horse
and
he
carried
her
up
the
field
against
her
will
the
two
met
almost
face
to
face
the
horses
exchanging
friendly
neighs
for
a
moment
while
one
could
count
twenty
the
two
rivals
sat
and
looked
at
each
other
half
unconsciously
ida
noticed
the
pallor
and
the
worn
look
of
the
beautiful
face
the
wistful
peevishness
of
the
delicately
cut
lip
then
suddenly
maude
face
flushed
her
eyes
grew
hard
and
scornful
and
with
something
like
a
sneer
she
said
in
a
metallic
tone
i
beg
your
pardon
but
are
you
aware
that
you
are
trespassing
a
saint
would
have
turned
on
such
provocation
and
ida
being
no
saint
felt
that
her
face
was
as
crimson
as
the
other
girl
and
grew
as
hot
of
heart
as
of
face
she
set
her
lips
tightly
and
tried
to
remain
silent
surely
it
would
be
better
in
every
way
better
to
ride
on
without
a
word
but
it
was
more
than
she
could
do
and
she
drew
herself
up
and
her
eyes
flashed
back
the
challenge
as
she
said
in
a
low
but
distinct
voice
pardon
me
but
you
are
mistaken
the
land
on
which
i
am
riding
belongs
to
me
maude
grew
pale
again
and
her
lips
set
closely
until
the
line
of
red
almost
disappeared
is
this
not
then
part
of
the
villa
estate
she
asked
no
it
is
part
of
the
herondale
estate
replied
ida
rather
more
gently
for
was
it
not
horrible
that
she
should
be
engaged
in
altercation
with
stafford
future
wife
then
i
presume
i
have
the
honour
of
speaking
to
miss
heron
said
maude
with
an
indefinable
air
combining
contempt
and
defiance
which
brought
the
colour
to
ida
face
again
my
name
is
ida
heron
yes
she
said
then
if
you
are
making
no
mistake
it
is
i
who
am
trespassing
said
maude
and
it
is
i
who
must
apologise
pray
consider
that
i
do
so
most
fully
miss
heron
no
apology
is
necessary
said
ida
still
more
gently
you
are
quite
welcome
to
ride
over
this
or
any
part
of
herondale
maude
gave
a
little
scornful
laugh
thanks
it
very
good
of
you
she
said
haughtily
and
with
that
covert
offensiveness
of
which
alas
a
woman
alone
is
capable
i
do
not
think
i
shall
have
any
desire
to
avail
myself
of
your
kind
permission
the
public
roads
and
the
land
belonging
to
my
house
will
i
think
prove
quite
sufficient
for
me
i
am
the
daughter
of
falconer
of
the
villa
at
brae
wood
ida
inclined
her
head
slightly
by
way
of
acknowledgment
and
adieu
and
without
another
word
rode
on
towards
the
gate
at
the
bottom
of
the
field
which
opened
on
to
the
road
adonis
who
had
been
delighted
to
meet
his
old
friend
promptly
followed
and
though
maude
falconer
tried
her
hardest
to
check
him
and
turn
him
he
inwardly
laughing
at
her
efforts
trotted
cheerfully
beside
rupert
and
continued
their
conversation
maude
was
half
mad
with
mortification
and
quite
unable
to
leave
ida
hated
side
she
raised
her
whip
and
struck
adonis
across
the
face
the
horse
who
had
never
received
such
a
blow
before
in
his
life
stopped
dead
short
falling
back
almost
on
to
his
haunches
then
reared
straight
up
and
in
a
moment
of
temper
tried
to
throw
her
off
indeed
she
must
have
fallen
but
ida
always
cool
at
such
moments
swept
sideways
caught
adonis
bridle
and
brought
him
on
all
fours
maude
was
instantly
jerked
forward
on
to
the
horse
neck
in
a
humiliating
fashion
but
recovering
her
seat
sat
trembling
with
passion
it
was
impossible
not
to
pity
her
and
ida
in
her
gentlest
and
quietest
of
voices
said
i
will
wait
here
will
not
go
through
the
gate
until
your
groom
comes
up
your
horse
will
be
quite
quiet
then
if
i
might
venture
to
say
so
i
think
it
would
be
wise
not
to
strike
him
across
the
head
very
few
horses
can
stand
it
and
this
one
is
and
exceptionally
spirited
she
was
stopped
by
maude
scornful
laugh
really
i
ought
to
feel
very
much
obliged
to
you
miss
heron
she
said
and
my
sense
of
obligation
is
almost
as
great
as
my
amazement
at
your
frankness
and
assurance
may
i
ask
you
to
be
good
enough
to
release
my
horse
reins
ida
hand
fell
from
the
reins
and
her
face
grew
crimson
but
before
she
could
have
retorted
even
if
she
had
intended
doing
so
maude
struck
the
horse
again
it
turned
and
dashed
across
the
field
kicking
and
plunging
violently
with
maude
swaying
perilously
in
the
saddle
ida
waited
until
the
groom
it
was
pottinger
had
gained
his
side
and
got
hold
of
the
horse
then
with
no
thought
of
bravado
but
simply
with
the
desire
to
get
away
from
the
spot
she
put
rupert
at
the
gate
and
leapt
into
the
road
chapter
xl
ida
rode
home
all
quivering
with
the
pain
of
her
meeting
with
maude
falconer
at
first
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
must
leave
herondale
for
a
time
at
any
rate
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
run
the
risk
of
meeting
the
beautiful
woman
who
had
stolen
stafford
from
her
but
as
she
grew
calmer
her
pride
came
to
her
aid
and
she
saw
that
to
run
away
would
be
cowardly
herondale
was
her
home
had
been
her
home
long
before
the
villa
had
sprung
up
and
to
desert
it
because
of
the
proximity
of
maude
falconer
would
be
almost
as
bad
as
if
a
soldier
should
desert
his
colors
but
for
the
next
few
days
she
did
not
leave
her
own
grounds
she
grew
pale
and
listless
and
lady
bannerdale
when
she
came
to
look
her
up
noticed
the
change
in
her
but
was
too
tactful
to
make
any
remark
upon
it
we
have
missed
you
so
much
my
dear
she
said
affectionately
indeed
my
husband
has
been
quite
fidgety
and
irritable
so
unlike
him
and
edwin
has
been
worse
if
it
were
possible
men
are
a
great
trouble
my
dear
ida
though
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
say
that
of
mine
for
i
count
myself
lucky
in
both
husband
and
son
edwin
has
scarcely
given
me
a
day
trouble
since
he
was
a
child
i
really
think
if
i
were
asked
what
are
the
best
gifts
bestowed
by
the
fairy
godmother
i
should
say
good
digestion
and
a
temper
to
match
and
i
am
quite
proud
of
edwin
strength
and
amiability
but
even
he
has
been
somewhat
of
a
trial
for
the
last
few
days
so
my
dear
girl
do
come
over
and
help
me
manage
them
ida
smiled
rather
absently
and
her
ladyship
glided
smoothly
from
the
subject
since
we
last
saw
you
we
have
called
at
the
villa
she
said
and
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
find
miss
falconer
at
home
she
is
alone
there
in
that
huge
palace
of
a
place
for
her
father
has
gone
back
to
london
and
though
i
was
never
very
much
taken
with
her
i
could
not
help
pitying
her
why
asked
ida
not
absently
now
but
in
her
quiet
reserved
manner
she
looks
so
well
actually
so
unhappy
replied
lady
bannerdale
she
was
in
mourning
and
her
face
she
is
really
an
extremely
beautiful
girl
was
like
marble
and
her
reception
of
me
was
almost
as
cold
i
am
afraid
that
she
has
had
more
trouble
than
we
are
aware
of
there
was
such
a
preoccupied
and
indifferent
air
about
her
it
occurred
to
me
that
she
was
fretting
for
her
absent
stafford
oh
dear
me
i
shall
never
remember
to
call
him
lord
highcliffe
and
i
resolved
to
carefully
refrain
from
mentioning
him
but
you
know
how
stupid
one
is
in
such
a
case
how
one
always
talks
about
lameness
in
the
presence
of
a
man
with
one
leg
and
in
the
midst
of
a
pause
in
the
conversation
which
by
the
way
was
nearly
all
on
my
side
i
blurted
out
with
you
heard
from
stafford
orme
lately
miss
falconer
suppose
you
mean
lord
highcliffe
lady
bannerdale
she
said
turning
her
cold
blue
eyes
on
my
scarlet
face
is
in
australia
and
is
well
i
do
not
hear
very
often
from
him
he
is
leading
a
very
busy
life
and
has
little
time
for
i
imagine
of
course
i
got
myself
away
as
soon
as
i
could
after
that
and
i
afraid
i
left
a
very
bad
impression
upon
miss
falconer
ida
said
nothing
but
leant
forward
and
stirred
the
fire
which
may
have
caused
the
colour
which
glowed
for
a
moment
or
two
on
her
face
i
am
sure
i
do
know
why
the
young
man
should
have
rushed
off
to
the
other
end
of
the
world
or
why
he
does
rush
back
again
and
marry
the
lady
of
his
heart
who
has
enough
money
for
both
of
them
and
would
make
an
extremely
handsome
and
stately
countess
by
the
way
have
you
ever
seen
the
present
lord
highcliffe
my
dear
yes
i
have
seen
him
ida
replied
in
the
tone
which
closes
a
subject
of
conversation
shall
i
give
you
some
more
tea
no
would
you
like
to
see
how
the
workmen
are
getting
on
i
think
they
are
working
very
quickly
they
will
want
this
part
of
the
house
presently
and
i
have
an
idea
of
going
away
for
a
time
perhaps
abroad
she
added
though
she
had
put
the
idea
away
from
her
until
this
moment
and
it
was
only
lady
talk
of
maude
falconer
which
started
it
again
in
her
mind
lady
bannerdale
looked
alarmed
oh
do
do
that
my
dear
she
said
if
you
are
obliged
to
turn
out
of
the
house
why
not
come
to
us
it
would
be
so
kind
and
sweet
of
you
ida
sighed
a
little
wearily
oh
i
do
suppose
they
will
insist
upon
ejecting
me
she
said
i
think
i
can
persuade
them
to
leave
me
two
or
three
rooms
lady
bannerdale
went
home
and
dropped
her
in
the
presence
of
lord
bannerdale
and
edwin
ida
rather
thinks
of
going
abroad
she
said
in
a
casual
way
at
the
dinner
table
lord
edwin
was
raising
his
wine
glass
to
his
lips
but
arrested
it
and
set
it
down
again
and
his
handsome
face
grew
long
and
grave
oh
we
shall
miss
her
remarked
lord
bannerdale
lamely
and
avoiding
looking
in
his
son
direction
not
another
word
was
said
but
the
next
day
lord
edwin
came
into
lady
bannerdale
room
with
that
affectation
of
ease
and
indifference
which
never
yet
deceived
a
mother
i
going
to
call
on
miss
heron
mother
he
said
any
message
lady
bannerdale
looked
at
him
her
brow
wrinkled
with
motherly
anxiety
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
she
desired
more
than
his
happiness
and
she
knew
that
the
marriage
with
ida
would
be
in
every
way
desirable
the
girl
was
one
in
a
thousand
the
bannerdale
estates
almost
joined
herondale
both
she
and
her
husband
were
fond
of
ida
who
they
knew
would
prove
a
worthy
successor
to
the
present
mistress
of
the
grange
but
just
because
it
seemed
so
desirable
and
lord
edwin
heart
was
so
passionately
set
upon
it
the
mother
was
anxious
she
saw
that
he
was
dressed
with
extreme
care
and
that
his
face
was
unusually
grave
you
will
give
ida
my
love
edwin
please
and
tell
her
she
turned
away
that
he
might
not
see
her
anxiety
that
is
all
but
it
means
a
great
deal
as
you
know
edwin
i
i
wish
you
every
happiness
my
dear
boy
thank
you
mother
he
said
by
no
means
in
an
unmanly
way
my
happiness
or
unhappiness
rests
with
her
when
he
arrived
at
the
hall
ida
was
just
going
out
for
a
ride
she
turned
back
with
him
to
the
thinking
that
he
had
brought
a
message
from
his
mother
probably
a
definite
invitation
to
stay
at
the
grange
and
in
her
mind
she
had
already
decided
to
decline
it
as
he
happened
to
stand
with
his
back
to
the
window
the
gravity
of
his
face
did
not
enlighten
her
and
with
something
like
a
start
she
received
his
first
words
miss
heron
my
mother
says
that
you
have
some
thought
of
leaving
herondale
of
going
abroad
if
that
is
so
i
can
not
let
you
go
without
without
my
speaking
to
you
so
i
have
come
over
this
afternoon
to
tell
you
as
well
as
i
can
what
i
have
on
my
mind
and
my
heart
not
very
good
at
expressing
myself
and
i
handicapped
in
the
present
instance
by
by
the
depth
of
my
feeling
of
course
i
trying
to
tell
you
that
i
love
you
i
thought
you
might
have
seen
it
he
said
with
a
touch
of
wonder
at
her
start
and
flush
of
surprise
but
i
see
you
have
not
noticed
it
i
love
you
very
much
indeed
and
i
feel
that
my
only
chance
of
happiness
lies
in
my
winning
you
for
my
wife
i
do
know
there
any
more
to
be
said
than
that
if
i
were
to
talk
for
a
month
i
love
you
and
have
loved
you
for
a
long
time
past
a
few
weeks
a
few
months
are
a
long
time
to
youth
when
it
is
in
love
the
very
first
day
i
saw
you
but
i
need
tell
you
that
only
i
like
you
to
know
that
it
is
a
sudden
fancy
and
one
that
i
shall
get
over
in
a
hurry
i
do
feel
as
though
i
shall
ever
get
over
it
at
all
i
do
know
that
i
want
to
please
do
speak
for
a
moment
there
was
something
else
i
wanted
to
say
i
got
it
all
arranged
as
i
came
along
but
the
sight
of
you
has
scattered
it
ida
had
been
going
to
speak
to
stop
him
but
at
this
appeal
she
remained
silent
standing
with
her
hands
closing
and
unclosing
on
her
whip
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
her
brows
drawn
straight
the
coldest
woman
can
not
listen
unmoved
to
a
declaration
of
love
and
ida
was
anything
but
cold
i
only
wanted
to
tell
you
he
went
on
that
my
people
are
very
anxious
that
you
should
say
both
my
father
and
mother
are
very
fond
of
you
i
think
you
know
that
and
he
stammered
a
little
here
for
the
first
time
and
well
there
are
the
estates
you
wo
mind
my
saying
that
both
you
and
i
have
to
think
of
them
they
belong
to
us
and
we
belong
to
them
and
if
we
were
married
but
i
do
lay
much
stress
upon
the
estates
being
so
close
i
come
and
ask
you
to
marry
me
if
i
were
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
or
you
had
a
penny
it
just
comes
to
this
that
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
that
if
you
marry
me
i
shall
be
the
happiest
man
and
my
people
the
proudest
people
in
england
there
was
a
warm
flush
on
his
handsome
face
an
eager
look
in
his
bright
eyes
and
he
had
pleaded
his
cause
very
well
in
an
outspoken
manly
way
which
never
fails
to
appeal
to
a
woman
ida
was
moved
the
crop
nearly
snapped
in
her
hands
and
her
eyes
grew
moist
he
saw
it
and
tried
to
take
her
hand
but
she
though
she
did
not
move
shook
her
head
very
gently
but
very
resolutely
no
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
i
want
to
tell
you
lord
edwin
how
proud
i
am
at
the
honour
you
have
paid
me
like
yourself
i
am
not
good
at
expressing
my
feelings
though
indeed
i
think
you
have
done
yourself
an
injustice
you
have
spoken
told
me
very
well
and
i
am
very
grateful
i
wish
i
could
say
ah
say
it
he
implored
her
eagerly
she
shook
her
head
again
and
lifting
her
eyes
and
looking
at
him
straightly
but
sadly
she
said
in
a
still
lower
voice
lord
edwin
i
do
not
love
you
i
never
said
thought
you
did
he
responded
promptly
why
only
known
me
such
a
short
time
and
i
not
such
a
conceited
bounder
to
think
that
you
fallen
in
love
with
me
already
i
only
want
you
to
let
me
try
and
win
your
love
and
i
think
i
shall
do
so
he
said
in
a
modest
but
manly
way
which
would
at
once
have
won
ida
heart
if
it
had
not
been
won
already
if
you
will
only
give
me
some
hope
just
tell
me
that
i
a
chance
that
you
let
me
try
ida
smiled
a
sad
little
smile
if
i
said
as
much
as
that
but
i
can
not
lord
edwin
you
you
have
told
me
that
you
love
me
and
it
would
not
be
fair
ah
please
try
to
persuade
me
do
you
see
how
terrible
it
would
be
if
i
were
to
let
you
think
that
i
might
come
to
care
for
you
and
i
did
not
do
so
for
god
sake
do
say
broke
from
him
and
his
face
paled
under
the
tan
she
turned
away
from
him
her
eyes
full
of
tears
which
she
dared
not
let
him
see
i
i
must
have
time
she
said
almost
desperately
will
you
give
me
a
day
two
days
she
asked
quite
humbly
i
want
to
do
what
you
want
but
i
want
to
think
there
is
something
i
should
have
to
tell
you
he
flushed
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
if
it
anything
that
happened
in
the
past
anyone
else
of
course
loving
you
as
i
do
i
have
seen
that
there
has
been
something
on
your
mind
some
trouble
besides
your
father
death
but
if
it
is
past
i
do
mind
i
know
i
can
teach
you
to
forget
it
whatever
it
is
ida
trust
yourself
to
me
she
drew
away
from
him
give
me
two
days
she
said
with
a
catch
in
her
breath
he
caught
at
the
hope
small
though
it
was
i
will
give
you
two
days
twenty
if
you
like
he
said
only
while
you
are
thinking
it
over
remember
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
that
my
people
will
love
you
as
a
daughter
that
oh
i
wo
say
any
more
i
ca
trust
myself
i
go
now
when
he
had
gone
ida
got
on
rupert
and
rode
to
the
top
of
the
hill
there
she
pulled
up
and
thought
with
all
her
heart
and
mind
she
could
not
doubt
his
love
she
could
not
but
feel
that
if
she
surrendered
herself
to
him
he
would
indeed
in
time
teach
her
to
forget
she
knew
that
it
was
her
duty
to
marry
his
word
about
the
estates
had
not
been
spoken
in
vain
yes
if
she
became
lord
edwin
wife
she
would
in
time
forget
but
alas
she
did
not
want
to
forget
her
love
for
stafford
was
still
as
strong
as
ever
and
with
its
bitterness
was
mingled
a
sweetness
which
was
sweeter
than
life
itself
and
yet
how
great
a
sin
it
was
how
shameful
a
one
that
she
should
love
a
man
who
was
pledged
to
another
woman
who
was
going
to
marry
her
she
came
in
late
for
dinner
and
could
scarcely
eat
her
reason
said
yes
her
heart
said
no
and
she
knew
that
she
ought
to
listen
to
her
reason
and
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
the
still
voice
in
her
heart
she
paced
up
and
down
the
pale
and
wan
with
the
fight
that
was
going
on
within
her
then
suddenly
she
resolved
that
she
would
accept
him
she
would
not
keep
him
in
suspense
it
would
not
be
fair
it
would
be
a
cruel
requital
of
his
love
and
generosity
she
went
to
the
and
hurriedly
as
if
she
were
afraid
of
hesitating
she
drew
a
sheet
of
paper
towards
her
and
wrote
dear
lord
edwin
she
had
got
thus
far
when
donald
and
bess
who
had
been
lying
beside
the
fire
sprang
up
and
ran
to
the
door
barking
loudly
she
laid
down
the
pen
and
opened
the
door
mechanically
the
moonlight
was
streaming
through
the
window
in
the
hall
the
dogs
bounded
to
the
front
door
still
barking
vociferously
still
mechanically
she
let
them
out
and
they
rushed
across
the
terrace
and
over
the
lawn
to
the
group
of
trees
beside
the
footpath
thinking
that
they
heard
jessie
whom
she
had
sent
to
bryndermere
ida
glad
of
the
interruption
followed
them
slowly
across
the
lawn
their
barking
ceased
suddenly
and
convinced
that
it
was
jessie
she
went
on
to
add
something
to
her
message
then
suddenly
she
saw
a
tall
figure
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
it
was
a
man
and
donald
and
bess
were
jumping
up
at
him
with
little
whines
of
pleasure
smitten
by
a
sudden
fear
she
stopped
but
the
man
raised
his
head
and
saw
her
and
with
an
exclamation
strode
towards
her
for
an
instant
she
thought
that
she
was
dreaming
that
her
imagination
was
playing
her
false
for
it
was
stafford
form
and
face
they
stood
and
gazed
at
each
other
her
brain
felt
dizzy
her
pale
face
grew
paler
she
knew
that
she
was
trembling
that
she
could
scarcely
stand
she
began
to
sway
to
and
fro
slightly
and
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
chapter
xli
she
did
not
resist
but
resigned
herself
to
his
embrace
as
if
he
still
had
the
right
to
take
her
in
his
arms
as
if
she
still
belonged
to
him
she
had
been
under
a
great
an
indescribable
strain
for
several
hours
and
his
sudden
presence
the
look
in
his
eyes
the
touch
of
his
hands
deprived
her
of
the
power
of
thought
of
resistance
to
her
and
to
him
at
that
moment
it
was
as
if
they
had
not
been
parted
as
if
the
events
of
the
last
few
months
were
only
visionary
with
surrender
in
every
fibre
of
her
being
she
lay
in
his
arms
her
head
upon
his
breast
her
eyes
closed
her
heart
throbbing
wildly
under
the
kisses
which
he
pressed
passionately
upon
her
lips
her
hair
the
while
he
called
upon
her
name
as
if
his
lips
hungered
to
pronounce
it
stafford
she
said
at
last
it
is
really
you
when
her
voice
died
away
as
if
she
were
speaking
in
a
dream
and
her
eyes
closed
with
a
little
shudder
of
perfect
joy
and
rest
yes
it
i
he
responded
in
a
voice
almost
as
low
as
hers
a
voice
that
trembled
with
the
intensity
of
his
passion
his
joy
in
having
her
in
his
arms
again
last
night
i
came
down
by
the
first
train
i
waited
at
the
station
for
it
i
came
straight
from
the
docks
she
drew
a
happy
sigh
so
soon
and
you
came
straight
here
when
i
saw
you
just
now
i
thought
it
was
a
vision
if
the
dogs
had
not
been
here
i
remembered
that
dogs
do
not
see
ghosts
oh
stafford
it
is
so
long
so
very
long
since
i
have
seen
you
so
sad
and
dreary
a
time
tell
me
ah
tell
me
everything
where
you
have
been
but
i
know
stafford
did
you
know
that
i
saw
you
the
day
you
sailed
she
shuddered
faintly
i
thought
that
was
a
vision
too
that
it
was
my
fancy
it
would
not
have
been
the
first
time
i
had
fancied
i
had
seen
you
he
drew
her
to
the
bank
and
sinking
on
it
held
her
in
his
arms
almost
like
a
child
you
saw
me
you
there
in
london
and
yet
i
can
understand
dearest
i
did
not
hear
of
your
trouble
until
a
few
weeks
ago
but
i
must
tell
you
yes
tell
me
i
long
to
hear
think
stafford
i
have
not
heard
of
you
i
saw
you
at
the
concert
in
london
one
night
he
started
and
held
her
more
tightly
i
looked
round
and
saw
you
and
when
you
turned
and
looked
up
towards
me
it
seemed
as
if
you
must
have
seen
me
but
tell
me
oh
i
want
to
hear
everything
the
spell
wrought
by
the
joy
of
his
presence
still
held
her
reason
her
memory
in
thrall
one
thought
one
fact
dominated
all
others
the
fact
that
he
was
here
that
she
was
in
his
arms
with
her
head
on
his
breast
as
of
old
and
the
spell
was
on
him
as
strongly
how
could
he
remember
the
past
and
the
barrier
he
had
erected
between
them
i
went
to
australia
ida
he
said
in
a
low
voice
every
note
of
which
was
pitched
to
love
harmony
it
soothed
while
it
rejoiced
her
i
met
a
man
in
london
a
farmer
who
offered
to
take
me
out
with
him
you
saw
me
start
you
say
how
strange
how
wonderful
and
i
yes
i
saw
you
but
i
could
not
believe
my
senses
how
could
it
be
my
beautiful
dainty
ida
the
mistress
of
herondale
standing
on
the
dirty
squalid
quay
i
went
with
him
and
worked
with
him
on
his
do
you
remember
how
you
taught
me
to
count
the
sheep
ida
god
how
often
when
i
was
riding
through
solitary
wastes
i
have
recalled
those
hours
every
look
of
your
dear
eyes
every
curve
of
those
sweet
lips
hold
them
up
to
me
dearest
every
tone
of
your
voice
the
low
musical
voice
the
memory
of
which
had
power
to
set
every
nerve
tingling
with
longing
and
despair
the
work
was
hard
it
seemed
unceasing
but
i
was
glad
of
it
for
sometimes
i
was
too
weary
to
think
too
weary
even
to
dream
of
you
and
it
was
sad
business
dreaming
of
you
ida
for
you
see
there
was
the
waking
do
i
not
know
she
murmured
with
something
like
a
sob
and
her
hand
closed
on
his
shoulder
my
employer
was
a
pleasant
genial
man
my
were
good
fellows
i
could
have
been
happy
or
at
least
contented
with
the
life
hard
as
it
was
if
i
could
but
have
forgotten
if
i
could
even
for
a
day
have
lost
the
awful
hunger
and
thirst
for
you
if
i
could
have
got
you
out
of
my
mind
the
memory
of
you
out
of
my
heart
but
i
could
not
he
paused
looking
straight
before
him
and
gazing
up
at
him
she
saw
his
face
drawn
and
haggard
as
if
he
still
thought
himself
separated
from
her
then
as
if
he
remembered
he
looked
down
at
her
and
caught
her
to
him
with
a
sudden
violence
that
almost
hurt
her
but
i
could
not
you
haunted
me
dearest
all
day
and
all
night
sometimes
when
the
men
were
singing
round
the
camp
fire
singing
and
laughing
the
sense
of
my
loss
would
come
crushing
down
upon
me
and
i
spring
to
my
feet
and
wander
out
into
the
starlit
silence
of
the
vast
plains
and
spend
the
night
thinking
of
all
that
had
passed
between
us
at
other
times
a
kind
of
madness
would
catch
hold
of
me
and
join
the
wildest
of
the
gangs
and
laugh
and
sing
and
drink
with
the
maddest
of
the
lot
she
drew
a
long
breath
of
comprehension
and
pity
and
hid
her
eyes
on
his
breast
he
bent
and
kissed
her
murmuring
penitently
i
not
fit
to
kiss
you
ida
i
did
not
mean
to
tell
you
but
but
i
ca
keep
anything
from
you
even
though
it
will
go
against
me
one
night
the
drinking
led
to
fighting
and
i
stood
up
to
a
son
of
anak
a
giant
of
a
fellow
and
we
fought
until
both
of
us
were
knocked
out
but
i
remember
him
going
down
first
just
before
i
fell
i
went
from
bad
to
worse
the
owner
of
the
run
it
was
called
salisbury
plain
spoke
a
word
of
warning
and
i
tried
to
pull
up
tried
to
take
to
the
work
again
and
forget
myself
in
it
but
ah
well
dearest
thank
god
you
would
not
understand
that
you
can
not
know
what
a
man
is
like
when
he
is
at
odds
with
fate
and
is
with
despair
do
i
not
she
murmured
again
with
the
fullest
understanding
and
compassion
do
you
think
he
is
worse
than
a
woman
on
stafford
there
have
been
times
black
times
when
i
learned
to
know
why
some
women
fly
to
drink
to
drown
their
misery
and
our
misery
is
as
keen
yes
keener
than
yours
for
we
are
so
helpless
so
shackled
we
have
nothing
else
to
do
but
think
think
think
go
on
dearest
i
seem
to
see
you
there
thank
god
you
could
not
he
said
huskily
the
black
fit
passed
for
a
time
and
i
settled
down
to
work
again
one
day
there
was
an
attack
upon
the
farm
by
the
blacks
as
they
are
called
i
was
fortunately
at
home
and
we
managed
to
beat
them
off
and
save
the
stock
it
was
a
valuable
one
and
my
employer
thinking
too
highly
of
my
services
made
me
a
present
of
half
the
value
it
was
a
generous
gift
a
lavish
one
and
altogether
uncalled
for
oh
stafford
do
you
think
i
do
know
that
you
risked
your
life
as
plainly
as
if
i
had
been
told
as
if
i
had
been
there
she
said
her
eyes
glowing
her
breath
coming
faster
stafford
coloured
and
turned
away
from
the
subject
it
was
a
large
sum
and
joffler
that
is
the
name
of
the
owner
of
salisbury
plain
advised
me
to
invest
it
in
a
run
of
my
own
there
was
enough
to
buy
a
large
and
important
one
i
went
down
to
melbourne
to
see
the
agents
and
is
there
no
such
thing
as
fate
or
chance
ida
indeed
there
is
as
i
was
walking
down
one
of
the
streets
i
heard
my
name
spoken
i
turned
and
saw
the
stableman
from
the
woodman
inn
groves
man
henry
murmured
ida
enviously
for
had
he
not
met
her
lover
yes
he
was
surprised
but
i
think
glad
to
see
me
and
we
went
to
a
hotel
and
talked
for
some
time
i
could
bring
myself
to
speak
your
name
you
see
dearest
it
had
lived
in
my
heart
so
long
and
i
had
only
whispered
it
to
the
stars
and
in
the
solitary
places
that
i
i
shrank
from
uttering
it
aloud
he
explained
with
masculine
simplicity
ida
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
she
nestled
closer
to
him
at
last
i
asked
after
the
people
and
nervously
mentioned
the
hall
and
and
ida
then
the
man
told
me
his
voice
grew
lower
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
head
and
stroked
her
hair
soothingly
pityingly
he
told
me
that
your
father
was
dead
had
died
suddenly
and
worse
for
it
was
worse
to
me
dearest
that
you
had
been
left
poor
and
penniless
she
sighed
but
as
one
who
sighs
looking
back
at
a
sorrow
which
has
passed
long
ago
and
is
swallowed
up
in
present
joy
i
asked
him
where
you
were
and
when
he
told
me
that
you
had
left
the
hall
and
that
it
was
said
you
you
were
working
for
a
livelihood
that
you
were
in
poverty
i
dearest
i
felt
as
if
i
should
go
mad
think
of
it
there
was
i
all
those
thousands
of
miles
away
with
all
that
money
in
my
possession
and
you
the
queen
of
my
heart
the
girl
i
loved
better
than
life
itself
in
poverty
and
perhaps
wanting
a
friend
he
was
silent
a
moment
and
ida
felt
him
shudder
as
if
he
were
again
tasting
the
bitterness
of
that
moment
when
i
had
taken
my
passage
he
went
on
succinctly
i
sent
henry
up
to
the
run
to
fill
my
place
and
with
him
a
letter
to
explain
my
sudden
departure
and
the
next
day
heaven
being
kind
to
me
i
should
have
gone
out
of
my
mind
if
i
had
had
to
wait
we
sailed
i
stood
at
the
bow
with
my
face
turned
towards
england
and
counted
the
days
before
i
could
get
there
and
begin
my
search
for
you
and
you
came
here
stafford
first
she
said
to
lead
him
on
for
what
an
unspeakable
bliss
it
was
to
listen
to
him
yes
i
knew
that
i
should
hear
some
tidings
of
you
here
there
would
be
a
lawyer
a
steward
who
would
know
i
little
thought
hoped
to
see
you
yourself
ida
i
came
from
the
station
to
look
at
the
old
place
to
walk
where
we
had
walked
to
stand
where
we
had
stood
i
stopped
under
the
trees
here
and
looked
at
the
house
at
the
terrace
where
i
had
seen
you
watched
for
you
i
could
see
that
men
had
been
at
work
and
i
thought
that
you
had
sold
the
place
that
the
new
people
were
altering
it
and
i
cursed
them
in
my
heart
for
every
stone
of
it
is
sacred
to
me
and
then
as
i
stood
looking
and
asking
myself
where
you
were
the
dogs
came
even
then
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
you
were
still
here
at
the
hall
and
when
i
saw
you
he
stopped
and
laughed
shortly
as
a
man
does
when
his
emotion
is
almost
too
much
for
him
i
made
up
my
mind
what
to
write
to
you
but
you
see
i
had
no
thought
no
hope
of
seeing
you
and
now
ah
well
it
hard
to
think
of
anything
with
you
in
my
arms
but
see
here
ida
there
is
any
need
to
say
anything
is
there
you
come
back
with
me
to
that
new
world
what
was
it
what
word
in
the
tender
loving
speech
that
like
a
breath
of
wind
sweeping
away
a
mountain
mist
cleared
the
mist
from
her
mind
woke
her
from
her
strange
condition
recalled
the
past
and
alas
and
alas
the
present
with
a
low
cry
a
cry
of
anguish
one
has
heard
it
from
the
lips
of
a
sufferer
waking
from
the
anodyne
of
sleep
to
fresh
pain
she
tore
herself
from
his
arms
and
with
both
hands
to
her
head
stood
regarding
him
her
face
white
something
like
terror
in
her
eyes
ida
he
cried
rising
and
stretching
out
his
hands
to
her
she
shrank
back
putting
out
her
hand
as
if
to
keep
him
off
do
do
come
near
me
oh
how
could
i
have
forgotten
how
could
i
i
must
have
been
mad
she
wrung
her
hands
and
bit
her
lips
as
if
she
were
tortured
by
the
shame
of
it
his
arms
fell
to
his
sides
and
he
stood
and
looked
at
her
with
his
teeth
set
ida
listen
to
me
i
i
too
had
forgotten
it
it
was
the
delight
of
seeing
you
but
dearest
what
does
the
past
matter
it
past
i
have
come
back
to
you
she
turned
to
him
with
suppressed
passion
why
did
you
leave
me
came
painfully
from
her
white
lips
his
face
grew
red
and
his
eyes
fell
before
hers
for
a
moment
at
times
his
sacrifice
of
her
to
his
father
need
had
seemed
not
only
inexcusable
but
shameful
the
shame
of
it
now
weighed
upon
him
ida
for
god
sake
listen
to
me
for
as
he
had
hesitated
she
had
turned
from
him
with
a
gesture
of
repudiation
listen
to
me
there
was
nothing
else
for
me
to
do
fate
left
me
no
alternative
my
father
ida
how
can
i
tell
you
my
father
good
name
his
reputation
were
in
my
hands
he
had
done
so
much
for
me
everything
there
has
never
been
a
father
like
him
my
happiness
stood
between
him
and
ruin
ah
not
mine
alone
but
yours
and
i
sacrificed
them
if
you
knew
all
you
would
forgive
me
the
wrong
i
did
great
as
it
was
i
think
now
if
the
time
were
to
come
over
again
that
yes
i
should
have
to
do
it
he
broke
out
i
could
not
have
stood
by
and
ruined
and
disgraced
without
stretching
out
my
hand
to
save
him
it
was
for
your
father
sake
she
said
almost
inaudibly
yes
he
responded
grimly
and
it
saved
him
saved
his
good
name
at
any
rate
the
rest
went
you
have
heard
she
made
a
gesture
of
assent
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
held
out
his
hand
to
her
can
you
not
forgive
me
ida
if
you
knew
what
the
sacrifice
cost
me
how
much
i
have
suffered
see
here
dearest
he
drew
still
closer
to
her
let
the
past
go
it
shall
i
swear
there
is
a
limit
to
a
endurance
and
i
have
passed
it
i
love
you
ida
i
want
you
come
back
with
me
and
let
us
live
for
each
other
live
for
love
dearest
i
will
teach
you
to
forget
the
wrong
i
did
you
it
very
little
i
have
to
offer
you
a
share
in
the
hard
life
of
a
farmer
out
there
in
the
wilds
but
if
you
were
still
the
mistress
of
herondale
instead
of
poor
half
unconsciously
she
broke
in
upon
his
prayer
i
am
still
what
i
was
i
am
not
poor
my
father
was
a
rich
man
when
he
died
stafford
regarded
her
with
surprise
then
he
moved
his
hand
as
if
he
were
waving
away
the
suggestion
of
an
obstacle
i
am
glad
for
your
sake
dearest
though
for
my
own
i
would
almost
rather
that
you
were
as
poor
as
i
thought
you
that
i
might
work
for
you
why
do
you
stand
and
look
at
me
so
hopelessly
what
else
is
there
to
divide
us
dearest
her
lips
opened
and
almost
inaudibly
she
breathed
your
honour
he
winced
and
set
his
teeth
hard
my
honour
yes
you
have
pledged
your
word
you
have
made
your
bargain
the
price
was
paid
i
suppose
you
say
so
then
in
honour
you
belong
to
the
colour
flamed
in
his
face
and
his
eyes
grew
hot
you
cast
me
off
you
drive
me
back
to
her
he
said
scarcely
knowing
what
he
said
yes
she
responded
faintly
you
belong
to
her
to
her
only
not
to
me
ah
not
to
me
no
no
do
not
come
near
me
do
not
touch
me
i
had
forgotten
i
was
mad
but
i
have
remembered
i
am
sane
now
driven
almost
beyond
himself
by
the
sudden
revulsion
from
joy
and
hope
to
doubt
and
despair
racked
by
the
swift
stemming
of
his
passion
stafford
unreasoning
anger
rose
against
her
it
is
always
so
with
the
man
my
god
you
send
me
away
to
her
you
you
do
it
coolly
easily
enough
perhaps
you
have
some
other
reason
someone
has
stepped
into
my
place
it
was
a
cruel
thing
to
say
even
in
his
madness
for
a
moment
she
cowered
under
it
then
she
raised
her
white
face
and
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
and
if
there
has
can
you
blame
me
you
cast
me
aside
you
sacrificed
me
to
your
father
honour
you
had
done
with
me
her
voice
vibrated
with
the
bitterness
which
had
been
her
portion
for
so
many
dreary
months
was
the
world
my
life
to
cease
from
that
time
forth
for
you
there
was
someone
else
wealth
rank
for
me
was
there
to
be
nothing
no
consolation
no
part
or
lot
in
life
yes
there
one
one
who
is
both
good
and
noble
and
she
broke
down
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
turned
away
stafford
stood
as
if
turned
to
stone
as
if
he
had
lost
the
sense
of
sight
and
hearing
silence
reigned
between
them
the
dogs
who
had
been
sitting
watching
them
rose
and
shivering
whined
complainingly
as
if
they
were
asking
what
was
amiss
it
was
the
woman
as
always
who
first
relented
and
was
moved
to
pity
she
moved
to
the
motionless
figure
and
touched
him
on
the
arm
forgive
me
i
i
did
not
mean
to
wound
you
but
but
you
drove
me
too
hard
but
but
it
is
true
we
can
not
undo
the
past
it
is
as
solid
as
unmovable
as
that
mountain
it
is
between
a
wall
a
barrier
of
stone
nothing
can
remove
it
you
you
will
remember
your
honour
stafford
her
voice
quavered
for
a
moment
but
she
steadied
it
you
you
will
not
lose
that
though
all
else
be
lost
you
will
go
to
her
he
looked
at
her
his
breath
coming
thick
and
painfully
my
god
you
you
are
hard
he
broke
out
at
last
i
am
just
oh
my
dearest
my
dearest
she
took
his
hand
and
laid
it
against
her
cheek
her
lips
do
you
see
how
much
it
costs
me
to
send
you
away
but
i
must
i
must
go
oh
go
now
i
i
can
not
bear
much
more
his
hand
it
shook
fell
softly
tenderly
on
her
head
god
forgive
me
for
the
wrong
i
have
wrought
you
the
tears
i
have
caused
you
he
said
hoarsely
yes
i
daresay
you
right
and
and
i
go
let
me
see
you
go
back
to
the
house
one
kiss
the
last
the
last
oh
ida
ida
life
of
my
life
soul
of
my
soul
he
caught
her
to
him
and
she
lay
in
his
arms
for
a
moment
her
lips
clung
to
his
in
one
long
kiss
then
she
tore
herself
away
from
him
and
fled
to
the
house
stafford
went
on
to
the
woodman
where
groves
was
surprised
and
it
need
scarcely
be
said
overjoyed
to
see
him
to
him
the
young
man
was
still
stafford
and
he
eyed
him
with
an
amazed
and
respectful
admiration
for
though
stafford
had
never
been
a
weakling
he
had
grown
so
hard
and
muscular
and
altogether
fit
that
groves
could
not
refrain
from
expressing
his
approval
ah
there
is
nothing
like
roughing
it
stafford
sir
he
said
i
can
tell
in
a
minute
when
a
man
right
through
and
been
doing
square
and
honest
work
it
seems
strange
to
us
commoner
people
that
you
gentle
folks
should
be
so
fond
of
going
through
all
sorts
of
hardships
and
perils
just
for
the
fun
of
it
but
after
all
it
not
to
be
wondered
at
for
that
the
kind
of
spirit
that
has
helped
englishmen
to
make
england
what
it
is
but
you
looking
a
little
pale
and
worn
sir
i
no
doubt
it
the
want
of
dinner
if
i
known
you
been
coming
but
you
know
i
do
my
best
sir
he
did
his
best
and
stafford
tried
to
do
justice
to
it
but
it
was
almost
impossible
to
eat
and
he
checked
the
almost
overmastering
desire
to
drink
ida
had
been
right
he
knew
it
though
the
thought
did
not
help
to
allay
his
bitterness
she
had
spoken
the
truth
he
was
still
pledged
to
maude
falconer
had
paid
the
price
demanded
and
it
was
not
his
fault
if
it
had
failed
to
save
sir
stephen
from
ruin
the
sacrifice
stafford
had
made
had
at
any
rate
saved
his
father
good
name
from
shame
and
reproach
maude
father
had
performed
his
part
of
the
bargain
stafford
had
still
to
perform
his
ida
was
right
she
had
pointed
out
to
him
his
duty
and
if
there
was
a
spark
of
manliness
left
in
him
he
must
do
it
he
sat
over
the
fire
close
over
it
as
he
had
done
in
the
backwoods
many
a
night
smoking
the
old
brier
pipe
that
had
cheered
him
in
his
hours
of
solitary
watching
and
thinking
with
a
grim
bitterness
that
it
would
have
been
better
for
him
if
he
had
been
knocked
on
the
head
the
night
of
the
raid
at
salisbury
plain
to
be
married
to
one
woman
while
he
loved
another
with
all
his
heart
and
soul
it
was
a
cruel
fate
but
cruel
as
it
was
he
had
to
bend
to
it
he
would
go
straight
to
london
and
find
maude
redeem
his
promise
and
save
his
honour
groves
came
into
the
room
with
a
bottle
of
the
port
and
stafford
forced
himself
to
show
an
interest
in
it
and
drink
a
glass
or
two
i
suppose
you
be
going
up
to
the
villa
sir
i
beg
your
pardon
i
mean
my
lord
and
i
must
apologise
for
not
calling
you
so
not
lord
said
stafford
i
have
never
used
the
title
groves
go
up
to
the
villa
why
should
i
he
asked
wearily
it
is
closed
is
it
groves
looked
at
him
with
surprise
no
sir
did
you
know
falconer
bought
it
and
he
and
miss
falconer
have
been
staying
there
she
is
there
now
stafford
turned
away
chance
was
making
his
hard
road
straight
after
a
sleepless
night
worse
even
than
some
of
the
worst
he
had
spent
in
australia
and
after
a
pretence
at
breakfast
he
went
slowly
up
to
the
villa
last
night
as
he
had
held
ida
in
his
arms
something
of
the
old
brightness
had
come
back
to
his
face
the
old
light
to
his
eyes
but
he
looked
haggard
and
wan
now
like
a
man
who
had
barely
recovered
from
a
long
and
trying
illness
he
turned
on
the
slope
of
the
terrace
and
looked
down
at
the
lake
lying
dark
and
sullen
under
a
cloudy
sky
and
it
seemed
to
him
typical
of
his
own
life
of
his
own
future
in
which
there
seemed
not
a
streak
of
light
a
servant
came
to
meet
him
yes
he
said
miss
falconer
is
in
she
was
in
the
he
thought
stafford
followed
him
the
man
opened
the
door
and
stafford
entered
maude
was
seated
at
a
table
writing
she
did
not
turn
her
head
and
he
stood
looking
at
her
and
seeing
the
record
the
weary
months
had
left
upon
her
face
and
even
in
his
own
misery
he
felt
some
pity
for
her
maude
he
said
in
a
low
voice
she
did
not
move
for
a
moment
but
looked
straight
before
her
wistfully
as
if
she
could
not
trust
her
ears
then
she
turned
and
came
towards
him
with
something
like
fear
on
her
face
the
fear
broke
up
as
it
were
and
stretching
out
her
arms
she
spoke
his
name
the
accents
of
love
fighting
with
those
of
doubt
and
a
joy
that
dreaded
its
own
greatness
stafford
it
is
you
she
pressed
her
hands
to
her
heart
for
a
moment
then
she
fell
into
his
arm
half
fainting
chapter
xlii
yes
my
father
bought
the
place
said
maude
i
asked
him
to
do
so
and
he
consented
at
once
i
could
not
have
let
it
pass
to
strangers
you
see
i
had
been
so
happy
here
it
was
here
that
you
asked
me
to
be
your
wife
and
father
has
offered
to
settle
it
upon
us
she
blushed
slightly
and
her
eyes
became
downcast
he
is
no
longer
opposed
to
our
marriage
he
knows
that
i
would
marry
you
if
all
the
world
cried
they
had
been
sitting
talking
for
nearly
an
hour
she
had
recovered
from
the
shock
of
his
sudden
presence
and
was
seated
beside
him
so
close
that
she
could
touch
him
with
her
hand
calm
now
but
with
a
glow
in
her
usually
pale
cheek
a
light
in
her
eyes
which
had
been
absent
for
many
a
weary
month
past
he
had
given
her
mostly
in
answer
to
her
eager
questions
a
very
abbreviated
account
of
his
life
in
australia
telling
her
less
even
than
he
had
told
ida
and
it
is
needless
to
remark
saying
nothing
of
the
cause
of
his
hasty
return
ah
well
she
said
drawing
a
long
breath
it
is
all
over
now
stafford
ah
it
is
good
to
have
you
back
safe
and
sound
you
are
well
are
you
not
you
look
pale
and
thin
and
and
tired
but
i
suppose
the
journey
yes
it
is
all
over
you
need
not
wander
any
longer
you
have
come
back
to
me
have
you
not
stafford
if
you
knew
how
i
have
missed
you
how
i
have
longed
for
you
and
now
you
will
settle
down
and
take
your
place
in
the
world
and
be
happy
do
you
think
i
shall
not
make
you
happy
stafford
ah
do
not
be
afraid
her
eyes
sought
his
and
her
hand
stole
towards
his
arm
he
rose
and
leant
against
the
i
only
know
that
i
am
quite
unworthy
of
you
maude
he
said
gravely
she
looked
up
at
him
and
laughed
are
you
who
cares
not
i
only
know
that
i
love
you
so
dearly
that
if
you
were
the
blackest
villain
to
be
found
in
fiction
it
would
make
no
difference
to
me
he
was
filled
with
shame
and
and
turned
away
his
head
that
she
might
not
see
the
shame
in
his
eyes
how
did
you
come
she
asked
presently
if
my
father
were
only
at
home
you
could
stay
with
us
then
i
am
staying
at
the
woodman
he
said
she
regarded
him
with
some
surprise
last
night
late
do
you
mean
did
you
meet
see
anyone
there
was
a
dawning
suspicion
in
her
eyes
and
she
regarded
his
averted
face
keenly
she
noticed
that
he
hesitated
and
seemed
embarrassed
no
one
you
know
he
replied
feeling
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
speak
ida
name
how
do
you
know
she
asked
with
a
curious
smile
who
was
it
i
met
miss
heron
of
herondale
he
said
trying
to
speak
casually
and
wondering
what
she
would
say
hoping
fervently
that
she
would
ask
no
more
questions
the
blood
rushed
to
her
face
her
eyes
flashed
and
her
lips
tightened
but
she
did
not
speak
and
moved
away
to
the
window
standing
there
looking
out
but
seeing
nothing
he
had
gone
to
the
moment
he
had
returned
what
did
it
mean
but
she
dared
not
ask
for
she
knew
instinctively
how
slight
was
the
chain
by
which
she
held
him
with
an
effort
she
restrained
the
rage
the
fierce
jealousy
which
threatened
to
burst
forth
in
violent
reproaches
and
accusation
and
after
a
minute
or
two
she
turned
to
him
outwardly
calm
and
smiling
have
you
made
any
plans
stafford
she
asked
my
father
was
speaking
of
your
return
he
thought
of
writing
to
you
dearest
there
must
be
no
reserve
between
us
now
now
that
you
have
come
back
see
i
speak
quite
frankly
my
father
thinks
thinks
that
our
marriage
should
take
place
at
once
he
has
withdrawn
his
objection
and
and
you
will
not
thwart
him
stafford
it
is
hard
for
me
to
have
to
say
this
but
but
you
will
understand
i
understand
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
am
grateful
to
your
father
our
marriage
shall
take
place
as
soon
as
you
please
it
is
for
you
to
fix
the
date
maude
she
nestled
against
him
and
touched
his
coat
with
her
lips
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
she
murmured
but
ah
well
love
casteth
out
shame
a
servant
knocked
at
the
door
the
horse
is
round
miss
he
announced
i
was
going
for
a
ride
she
said
but
i
will
send
the
horse
away
unless
you
will
ride
with
me
you
will
stafford
certainly
he
said
glad
of
the
interruption
to
this
which
had
been
to
him
a
positive
torture
i
will
not
be
five
minutes
she
said
brightly
you
like
to
go
over
the
house
they
shall
bring
you
something
to
drink
in
the
or
here
if
you
like
you
are
lord
and
master
she
went
up
to
her
room
and
when
she
had
rung
for
her
maid
paced
up
and
down
feverishly
he
had
gone
to
that
girl
before
he
had
come
to
her
she
was
racked
with
hate
and
jealousy
which
was
all
the
harder
to
bear
because
she
knew
she
must
hide
them
within
her
bosom
that
no
word
or
look
of
hers
must
let
him
see
that
she
knew
of
her
rival
some
time
after
they
were
marred
she
would
tell
him
but
not
till
she
was
safe
she
got
into
her
habit
quickly
and
went
down
to
him
he
was
standing
where
she
had
left
him
and
as
she
entered
the
room
she
saw
before
he
had
time
to
turn
to
her
with
a
smile
how
haggard
and
harassed
he
looked
you
have
been
quick
he
said
yes
i
am
learning
one
of
my
wifely
duties
not
to
keep
my
husband
waiting
they
went
out
and
pottinger
standing
by
the
horses
touched
his
hat
and
grew
red
with
joy
at
sight
of
his
master
well
pottinger
glad
to
see
you
said
stafford
and
he
was
genuinely
glad
you
looking
well
and
the
horse
is
too
halloo
you
put
the
on
adonis
he
added
as
he
went
up
and
patted
the
horse
pottinger
touched
his
hat
again
yes
sir
miss
falconer
been
riding
him
and
i
did
not
know
that
i
ought
to
change
the
saddle
i
can
do
so
in
a
minute
no
no
said
stafford
never
mind
i
will
ride
the
hunter
as
you
have
the
saddle
on
him
you
like
adonis
maude
oh
yes
she
replied
though
i
not
quite
sure
he
likes
me
she
added
with
a
laugh
stafford
put
her
up
and
noticed
with
some
surprise
that
adonis
seemed
restless
and
ill
at
ease
and
that
he
shivered
and
shrank
as
he
felt
maude
on
his
back
what
is
the
matter
with
him
he
said
he
seems
fidgety
does
the
saddle
fit
yes
sir
said
pottinger
with
a
glance
at
maude
followed
by
the
impassive
expression
of
the
trained
servant
who
can
not
speak
out
he
is
troublesome
sometimes
said
maude
but
i
can
manage
him
quite
easily
oh
yes
assented
stafford
he
is
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
but
he
is
highly
bred
and
as
highly
strung
as
they
were
starting
pottinger
murmured
do
curb
him
too
tightly
miss
maude
ignored
the
warning
and
she
and
stafford
rode
out
the
rain
had
ceased
the
clouds
had
passed
away
and
in
the
joy
of
his
nearness
her
spirits
rose
a
feeling
of
triumph
swelled
in
her
bosom
how
little
i
thought
yesterday
even
this
morning
that
we
should
be
riding
side
by
side
stafford
she
said
how
little
i
thought
i
should
have
you
back
again
my
own
my
very
own
do
all
these
months
you
been
away
seem
like
a
dream
to
you
they
do
to
me
she
drew
a
long
breath
let
us
ride
across
the
dale
you
will
find
it
wet
there
had
you
not
better
keep
to
the
road
no
no
she
said
adonis
is
dying
for
a
gallop
see
how
he
is
fretting
stafford
looked
at
the
horse
curiously
he
was
champing
his
bit
and
throwing
up
his
head
in
a
nervous
agitated
manner
which
stafford
had
never
seen
him
display
before
i
ca
make
the
horse
out
he
said
more
to
himself
than
maude
perhaps
he
be
all
right
after
a
gallop
they
crossed
the
road
at
a
trot
which
was
an
uneven
one
on
part
and
got
on
the
moor
maude
still
in
high
spirit
still
buoyed
up
by
her
feeling
of
triumph
talked
continuously
telling
him
some
of
the
london
news
planning
out
their
future
they
would
have
a
house
in
london
stafford
should
take
his
proper
place
in
the
world
they
would
step
back
to
the
high
position
which
was
his
by
right
as
a
peer
of
the
realm
stafford
was
scarcely
listening
a
question
was
haunting
him
a
question
which
he
could
not
thrust
from
him
he
was
going
to
marry
maude
falconer
going
to
take
the
hard
and
stony
road
of
duty
which
ida
in
her
noble
way
had
pointed
out
to
him
ought
he
not
to
tell
maude
about
ida
and
his
broken
engagement
to
her
would
it
not
be
better
for
both
of
them
for
all
of
them
if
he
were
to
do
so
he
would
have
to
tell
her
that
he
could
not
live
at
the
villa
she
would
want
to
know
the
reason
would
it
not
be
better
to
tell
her
he
raised
his
head
to
begin
when
suddenly
he
saw
going
up
the
hill
in
front
of
them
a
horse
and
horsewoman
she
was
walking
up
slowly
and
long
before
her
figure
stood
out
against
the
clear
sky
he
saw
that
it
was
ida
it
is
scarcely
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
his
heart
stood
still
that
she
should
have
appeared
before
him
in
his
sight
at
such
a
moment
while
he
was
riding
beside
his
future
wife
his
future
wife
filled
him
with
bitterness
his
face
must
have
paled
or
maude
must
have
seen
him
start
for
she
looked
at
him
and
then
turned
her
head
and
looked
in
the
direction
in
which
his
eyes
were
fixed
she
recognised
ida
instantly
the
colour
rushed
to
her
face
her
hand
tightened
on
her
rein
spasmodically
for
a
moment
she
felt
inclined
to
turn
aside
to
ride
away
escape
from
the
girl
she
hated
and
loathed
and
then
she
was
moved
by
another
impulse
the
demon
of
jealousy
whispered
this
is
the
moment
of
your
triumph
why
not
enjoy
it
to
the
full
why
not
let
her
feel
the
bitterness
of
defeat
there
is
your
rival
let
her
see
with
her
own
eyes
your
triumph
and
your
happiness
the
temptation
was
too
great
for
her
and
she
yielded
to
it
who
is
that
riding
up
the
hill
she
said
controlling
her
voice
admirably
it
is
miss
heron
is
it
not
yes
it
is
he
said
as
impassively
as
he
could
her
lips
curled
scornfully
at
his
assumption
of
indifference
i
have
seen
her
and
met
her
she
said
but
i
have
not
been
introduced
to
her
let
us
overtake
her
and
you
can
introduce
me
i
should
like
to
know
her
he
looked
straight
before
him
his
face
grave
and
set
is
it
worth
while
he
said
in
a
low
voice
some
other
time
why
not
now
she
asked
we
can
catch
her
quite
easily
the
moment
had
come
for
him
to
tell
her
not
now
he
said
huskily
i
have
something
to
tell
you
maude
something
you
ought
to
know
before
before
you
make
miss
acquaintance
she
turned
to
him
with
a
low
laugh
do
you
think
i
do
know
she
said
between
her
teeth
i
have
know
all
along
i
read
the
letter
you
wrote
to
her
i
got
it
stole
it
if
you
like
from
pottinger
i
have
known
all
along
do
you
not
think
i
have
been
very
patient
very
discreet
even
now
i
bear
no
malice
i
can
forget
the
past
forget
and
forgive
why
should
i
not
seeing
that
i
am
assured
of
your
love
and
good
faith
you
will
see
how
completely
i
forget
how
little
importance
i
attach
to
your
fancy
for
the
girl
a
fancy
which
i
am
sure
you
have
quite
outgrown
oh
i
can
trust
you
we
will
join
miss
heron
by
all
means
his
face
was
dark
and
heavy
do
not
maude
until
you
heard
all
he
began
but
with
a
scornful
laugh
that
yet
had
something
doubting
and
desperate
in
it
she
sent
adonis
on
he
sprang
forward
nervously
and
shivering
under
a
stroke
from
her
whip
and
swiftly
lessened
the
distance
between
him
and
rupert
who
heard
his
approach
before
ida
did
and
who
neighed
a
welcome
ida
turned
and
saw
who
was
following
her
saw
stafford
just
behind
and
gathering
her
reins
together
she
rode
rupert
quickly
to
the
top
of
the
hill
miss
heron
cried
maude
in
a
voice
of
covert
insolence
but
almost
open
triumph
miss
heron
stop
please
ida
did
stop
for
a
moment
then
feeling
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
meet
them
that
day
at
any
rate
she
let
rupert
go
again
by
this
time
stafford
had
almost
gained
maude
side
his
face
was
dark
with
anger
his
teeth
clenched
tightly
he
knew
that
maude
intended
to
flaunt
her
possession
of
him
before
ida
in
a
low
but
perfectly
distinct
voice
he
said
stop
maude
do
not
follow
her
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
him
her
face
flushed
her
eyes
flashing
why
not
she
demanded
scornfully
is
she
afraid
or
is
it
you
who
are
afraid
both
perhaps
we
shall
see
before
he
could
catch
her
rein
she
had
struck
adonis
twice
with
the
sharp
cutting
whip
and
with
a
shake
of
his
head
and
a
snort
of
rage
and
resentment
he
stood
on
his
haunches
for
a
moment
then
leapt
forward
and
began
to
race
down
the
hill
stafford
saw
that
the
horse
had
bolted
either
from
fear
or
anger
he
knew
that
it
would
only
increase
maude
peril
if
he
galloped
in
pursuit
behind
her
he
therefore
checked
his
horse
and
made
in
a
slanting
line
for
a
point
towards
which
he
judged
adonis
would
go
maude
was
swaying
in
her
saddle
in
which
she
could
only
keep
herself
by
clutching
at
the
pommel
it
seemed
every
moment
as
if
she
must
fall
as
if
the
horse
itself
must
fall
and
throw
her
like
a
stone
down
the
steep
hill
ida
the
moment
she
had
got
over
the
top
of
the
hill
had
ridden
quickly
and
of
course
quite
fearlessly
and
safely
and
had
got
rupert
so
well
in
hand
as
usual
that
when
she
heard
the
clatter
behind
her
and
turning
saw
the
peril
in
which
maude
had
put
herself
she
was
able
to
pull
rupert
up
it
was
almost
a
repetition
of
what
had
occurred
the
other
day
but
this
time
maude
falconer
peril
was
infinitely
greater
for
her
horse
was
half
mad
and
tearing
down
the
steep
rendered
doubly
dangerous
by
the
loose
stones
and
was
all
too
evidently
indifferent
whether
he
stood
or
fell
and
yet
another
risk
lay
just
below
for
william
had
been
digging
in
that
spot
for
stones
to
mend
the
bank
and
even
if
the
maddened
horse
saw
the
hole
it
was
more
than
probable
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
pull
up
in
time
such
moments
as
these
form
the
criterion
of
true
courage
there
was
only
one
way
in
which
ida
could
save
or
attempt
to
save
the
woman
who
was
drawing
towards
her
at
breakneck
speed
what
she
would
have
to
attempt
to
do
would
be
to
ride
straight
for
the
oncoming
horse
swerve
almost
as
she
reached
it
and
keep
side
by
side
with
it
until
she
could
succeed
either
in
turning
it
away
from
that
horrible
hole
or
stop
it
by
throwing
it
she
did
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
it
may
be
said
in
all
truth
that
at
that
moment
she
forgot
that
the
woman
whose
life
she
was
going
to
save
was
maude
falconer
she
did
not
realise
the
fact
or
if
she
did
she
was
indifferent
to
it
that
she
was
risking
her
own
life
to
save
the
woman
who
had
robbed
her
of
stafford
there
was
the
life
to
be
saved
and
that
was
enough
for
ida
she
slipped
her
foot
almost
out
of
the
stirrup
felt
rupert
mouth
firmly
but
gently
leant
forward
and
whispered
a
word
to
him
which
it
is
very
likely
he
understood
perhaps
he
saw
all
the
game
even
before
she
did
and
with
an
encouraging
touch
of
her
hand
she
let
him
go
he
sprang
forward
like
an
arrow
from
the
bow
as
they
drew
near
the
flying
horse
ida
shifted
her
whip
to
her
left
hand
so
that
her
right
should
be
free
and
leaning
as
far
in
the
saddle
as
she
could
with
safety
she
made
a
snatch
at
adonis
rein
at
the
moment
she
came
alongside
him
she
would
have
caught
the
rein
she
might
have
stopped
the
horse
or
turned
it
aside
god
alone
knows
but
as
her
fingers
almost
grasped
it
maude
steadied
in
her
seat
by
the
nearness
of
her
rescuer
raised
her
whip
and
struck
ida
across
the
bosom
and
across
the
outstretched
hand
the
blow
in
its
finish
fell
on
reeking
neck
with
a
snort
he
tore
away
from
the
other
horse
and
swept
onwards
with
maude
once
again
swaying
in
her
saddle
ida
gazed
at
her
in
speechless
terror
for
an
instant
then
as
if
she
could
look
no
longer
she
flung
up
her
arm
across
her
eyes
a
moment
afterwards
a
cry
a
shrill
scream
that
rang
in
her
ears
for
many
a
day
afterwards
rose
above
the
clatter
of
adonis
hoofs
and
before
the
cry
had
died
away
horse
and
rider
had
fallen
with
awful
force
into
and
across
the
hole
then
came
a
dead
silence
broken
only
by
the
sound
of
the
horse
iron
shoes
as
he
kicked
wildly
and
pawed
in
a
vain
attempt
to
rise
ida
rode
up
and
flinging
herself
to
the
ground
tried
to
approach
the
struggling
animal
but
indeed
it
was
horror
and
not
fear
that
struck
her
motionless
for
a
moment
for
horse
and
rider
were
mixed
in
awful
confusion
and
already
maude
graceful
form
was
stained
with
blood
and
battered
by
the
madly
kicking
animal
now
in
its
an
instant
after
before
she
could
recover
from
her
paralysis
of
terror
the
whole
affair
was
one
of
a
moment
and
had
passed
as
quickly
as
a
flitting
cloud
stafford
was
by
her
side
and
at
work
extricating
woman
from
horse
it
was
not
an
easy
task
for
though
adonis
was
now
dead
a
part
of
maude
body
lay
under
his
shoulder
but
with
utmost
herculean
strength
stafford
succeeded
in
getting
her
clear
and
lifted
her
out
of
the
hole
on
to
the
grass
kneeling
beside
him
ida
calm
now
but
trembling
raised
maude
head
on
her
knee
and
wiped
the
blood
from
the
beautiful
face
its
loveliness
was
not
marred
there
was
no
bruise
or
cut
upon
it
the
blood
having
flown
from
a
wound
just
behind
the
temple
stafford
ran
to
the
brook
for
some
water
and
tried
to
force
a
few
drops
through
the
clenched
teeth
while
ida
bathed
the
white
brow
suddenly
a
tremor
ran
through
him
and
he
put
his
hand
over
maude
heart
it
was
quite
still
he
bent
his
cheek
to
her
lips
no
breath
met
them
for
a
moment
or
two
he
could
not
speak
then
he
stayed
ida
ministering
hand
and
looking
up
at
her
said
it
is
of
no
use
she
is
dead
chapter
xliii
the
ball
which
lady
clansford
always
gave
about
the
middle
of
the
season
is
generally
a
very
brilliant
affair
but
this
year
it
was
more
brilliant
and
alas
more
crowded
than
usual
for
lord
clansford
was
connected
as
everybody
knows
with
the
great
company
and
as
also
everybody
knows
that
company
had
recovered
from
the
blow
dealt
it
by
the
rising
of
the
natives
and
was
now
flourishing
beyond
the
most
sanguine
expectations
of
its
owners
the
clansford
coffers
not
to
mention
those
of
many
other
persons
were
overflowing
and
lord
clansford
could
afford
a
somewhat
magnificent
hospitality
howard
as
he
made
his
way
up
the
crowded
stairs
smiled
cynically
to
himself
as
he
caught
sight
of
a
little
knot
of
financiers
who
stood
just
outside
the
great
doors
of
the
they
were
all
there
griffenberg
wirsch
the
beltons
efford
and
fitzharford
and
they
were
all
smiling
and
in
the
best
of
humours
presenting
by
their
appearance
a
striking
contrast
to
that
which
they
had
worn
when
he
had
seen
them
on
the
night
when
the
ruin
of
the
company
had
been
conveyed
in
that
fatal
cablegram
having
succeeded
at
last
in
forcing
an
entrance
and
bowing
over
the
hand
of
his
noble
hostess
which
must
have
sadly
ached
and
returned
her
mechanical
words
of
welcome
with
a
smile
as
galvanic
as
her
own
howard
sidled
his
way
along
the
wall
a
waltz
was
in
progress
and
collided
against
the
beautiful
and
bounteous
bertie
who
was
mopping
his
brow
and
looking
round
despairingly
for
his
partner
halloo
howard
he
exclaimed
pretty
old
scrimmage
is
it
should
have
thought
your
languid
grace
would
have
kept
out
of
this
sight
given
a
dance
to
a
girl
but
dash
my
best
necktie
if
i
can
find
her
might
as
well
look
for
a
needle
in
a
bottle
of
hay
as
if
any
fellow
would
be
such
a
fool
as
to
put
a
needle
in
such
a
place
i
jolly
mad
at
losing
her
i
can
tell
you
for
she
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
room
and
i
had
to
fight
like
a
to
get
a
dance
from
her
and
now
i
ca
find
her
just
my
luck
what
is
the
name
of
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
room
asked
howard
languidly
oh
it
the
new
beauty
of
course
replied
bertie
with
a
superior
little
shrug
at
howard
ignorance
it
miss
heron
of
herondale
the
great
heiress
howard
pricked
up
his
ears
but
maintained
his
languid
and
manner
miss
heron
of
herondale
he
said
in
his
slow
voice
do
think
met
her
no
dessay
not
she
does
go
out
much
and
lady
clansford
thinks
it
rather
a
feather
in
her
cap
getting
her
here
when
you
see
her
you
wo
say
i
her
she
more
than
pretty
and
she
be
the
bright
and
particular
star
of
the
season
if
she
keep
in
her
shell
so
much
herondale
said
howard
musingly
that
the
place
near
the
villa
is
it
i
do
remember
anyone
of
her
name
as
having
been
amongst
the
company
there
no
said
the
omniscient
bertie
she
was
living
in
retirement
with
her
father
then
but
stafford
must
have
known
her
made
her
acquaintance
do
you
remember
that
she
was
present
when
poor
miss
falconer
met
with
her
fatal
accident
howard
remembered
very
well
but
he
said
ah
yes
as
if
the
fact
had
just
been
recalled
to
him
her
father
died
and
left
her
a
hatful
of
money
that
ever
so
many
months
ago
and
now
she
come
up
to
london
and
i
tell
you
howard
that
it
is
with
her
as
it
was
with
the
friend
of
our
days
came
i
was
seen
i
conquered
everybody
is
mad
about
her
she
is
staying
with
some
country
people
called
the
vaynes
people
who
would
have
passed
like
a
third
unnoticed
but
they
are
deluged
with
invitations
and
on
account
of
eliza
do
not
be
vulgar
bertie
said
howard
rebukingly
well
it
was
vulgar
admitted
bertie
especially
applied
to
such
an
exquisite
creature
as
miss
heron
oh
there
she
is
with
young
glarn
they
say
that
he
is
more
than
ready
to
lay
his
ducal
coronet
at
her
feet
confound
the
young
beggar
but
she
does
give
him
the
least
encouragement
to
do
so
look
she
does
appear
to
be
listening
to
him
though
he
talking
for
all
he
worth
and
it
the
same
with
all
of
us
we
all
dying
with
love
for
her
and
for
all
she
cares
we
may
die
howard
looked
across
the
room
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
tall
slim
figure
a
pale
face
with
soft
and
silky
black
hair
dressed
in
the
simplest
fashion
and
dark
violet
eyes
half
hidden
by
their
long
lashes
it
was
a
lovely
face
and
something
more
an
impressive
one
it
was
a
face
once
seen
not
easily
forgotten
perhaps
it
was
not
its
beauty
but
a
certain
preoccupied
expression
a
sadness
in
the
eyes
and
in
the
curve
of
the
expressive
lips
which
made
it
so
haunting
a
one
she
was
exquisitely
dressed
with
a
suggestion
of
mourning
in
the
absence
of
diamonds
and
a
touch
of
pale
violet
in
the
black
lace
frock
she
is
very
beautiful
said
howard
and
i
can
condole
with
you
sincerely
on
the
loss
of
your
dance
yes
it
nearly
over
now
said
bertie
with
a
sigh
talking
of
stafford
he
said
after
a
minute
when
did
you
hear
from
him
last
replied
howard
i
have
his
letter
in
my
pocket
still
out
in
the
backwoods
asked
bertie
poor
old
chap
awful
piece
of
luck
for
him
if
his
father
had
only
gone
on
living
and
waited
until
that
blessed
company
had
come
right
side
uppermost
he
have
been
a
millionaire
look
at
griffenberg
and
the
rest
of
he
nodded
towards
the
group
of
financiers
they
simply
rolling
in
money
rolling
in
it
yes
he
still
in
the
backwoods
as
you
call
it
responded
howard
and
from
what
he
says
i
should
think
he
having
a
pretty
hard
time
of
it
though
of
course
he
does
complain
there
are
some
men
still
left
who
do
complain
there
was
a
pause
during
which
he
had
been
thinking
deeply
then
he
said
so
stafford
knew
miss
heron
did
he
bertie
looked
mysterious
and
lowered
his
voice
yes
look
here
old
chap
i
should
say
this
to
anyone
but
you
but
you
are
stafford
great
and
only
chum
and
i
know
i
can
speak
safely
to
tell
you
the
truth
now
you
are
going
to
tell
me
anything
but
the
truth
murmured
howard
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
oh
no
i
not
retorted
bertie
what
there
is
of
it
is
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
it
is
much
but
i
a
kind
of
idea
that
stafford
knew
our
new
beauty
better
than
we
think
do
you
remember
how
he
used
to
leave
our
party
and
go
off
by
himself
not
like
stafford
that
was
it
and
one
of
our
fellows
remarked
to
me
that
one
day
coming
home
from
a
ride
he
saw
stafford
riding
with
a
lady
he
could
swear
to
him
but
well
stafford
hard
to
mistake
then
again
how
was
it
he
and
miss
heron
were
in
at
maude
falconer
death
and
why
did
he
bolt
off
to
australia
again
directly
after
the
funeral
and
why
is
it
that
she
keeps
us
all
at
arm
length
even
that
confounded
glarn
howard
eyes
grew
sharp
but
he
smiled
languidly
as
he
said
you
ought
to
edit
a
riddle
book
bertie
my
son
i
think
we
should
get
across
the
room
now
i
should
be
greatly
obliged
if
you
would
introduce
me
to
miss
heron
all
right
said
bertie
come
along
but
i
warn
you
you
only
meet
with
a
cold
reception
just
a
smile
and
a
word
and
then
she
look
away
as
if
she
forgotten
your
existence
and
had
not
the
least
desire
to
remember
it
oh
i
used
to
that
said
howard
lead
on
as
they
crossed
the
room
howard
acute
brain
was
hard
at
work
there
was
something
in
stafford
conduct
a
tone
in
his
letters
which
howard
could
never
understand
but
now
in
the
light
of
bertie
mysterious
communication
he
thought
he
discerned
a
solution
of
the
problem
over
which
he
had
pondered
for
many
an
hour
stafford
had
been
unhappy
during
the
whole
of
his
engagement
to
poor
maude
he
had
exiled
himself
again
immediately
after
her
death
though
as
howard
knew
he
was
well
enough
off
now
to
return
to
england
and
to
live
at
any
rate
in
a
quiet
way
if
there
was
anything
in
bertie
suggestion
howard
pursed
his
lips
with
an
air
of
determination
if
there
was
anything
then
he
would
find
it
out
and
act
accordingly
stafford
happiness
was
very
precious
to
howard
and
in
the
quiet
resolute
cynical
way
characteristic
to
him
he
resolved
that
if
that
happiness
lay
in
the
hands
of
this
beautiful
girl
with
the
sad
eyes
and
lips
he
howard
would
do
his
best
to
persuade
her
to
yield
it
up
his
reception
was
certainly
not
encouraging
ida
glanced
at
him
and
returned
his
bow
with
a
slight
inclination
of
her
head
and
then
looked
away
as
if
she
had
done
all
that
could
be
demanded
of
her
and
it
was
with
a
faint
surprise
perceptible
in
her
face
that
she
heard
howard
say
in
his
slow
and
rather
drawling
voice
there
is
a
conservatory
behind
that
glass
door
miss
heron
it
is
not
very
far
from
the
madding
crowd
but
it
must
be
cooler
than
here
will
you
let
me
take
you
to
it
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
but
something
in
the
steady
regard
of
howard
calm
and
sleepy
eyes
impressed
her
very
well
she
said
but
i
think
i
engaged
for
this
next
dance
and
i
must
not
go
far
away
i
have
already
broken
two
or
three
engagements
in
that
case
you
can
come
without
hesitation
he
said
it
is
the
first
crime
that
costs
a
pang
having
passed
that
the
downward
course
is
easy
and
painless
he
led
her
to
a
seat
and
with
the
cool
determination
which
stafford
always
admired
in
him
began
at
once
for
he
did
not
wish
to
give
her
time
to
slip
on
her
woman
armour
he
intended
to
strike
quickly
unexpectedly
so
that
she
should
not
be
able
to
conceal
the
effect
of
the
blow
almost
as
hot
as
in
australia
he
said
languidly
but
watching
her
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
i
suppose
you
were
never
there
miss
heron
nor
have
i
been
but
i
got
a
letter
in
my
pocket
from
a
very
great
friend
of
mine
who
is
roughing
it
on
a
and
he
has
so
often
described
the
country
to
me
that
i
almost
feel
as
if
i
knew
it
by
the
way
i
think
you
know
him
he
is
my
dearest
and
closest
friend
stafford
orme
as
i
always
call
him
and
think
of
him
of
course
i
am
speaking
of
lord
highcliffe
the
problem
was
solved
he
saw
her
face
suddenly
flush
and
then
as
suddenly
grow
pale
so
sharp
had
been
the
blow
its
effect
so
overwhelming
that
her
fan
fell
from
her
hand
howard
as
he
restored
it
to
her
seized
the
opportunity
of
looking
her
full
in
the
face
and
assurance
was
made
doubly
sure
this
girl
hold
his
friend
stafford
happiness
in
her
hand
ida
was
silent
for
a
moment
because
she
knew
she
could
not
control
her
voice
could
not
keep
it
steady
then
with
a
quickened
breath
she
said
yes
i
knew
orme
lord
highcliffe
then
i
hope
you
liked
him
he
said
mercilessly
for
there
was
no
time
for
mercy
some
idiot
of
a
would
come
and
take
her
from
him
the
next
minute
i
express
the
hope
because
i
myself
like
and
admire
him
very
much
indeed
he
is
a
splendid
fellow
and
one
of
those
instances
of
a
good
man
struggling
with
adversity
are
you
fond
of
poetry
miss
heron
ida
bosom
was
heaving
she
was
fighting
for
calm
she
knew
now
who
it
was
with
whom
she
was
speaking
it
was
the
friend
the
cynical
howard
of
whom
stafford
had
told
her
she
had
not
caught
his
name
at
the
introduction
she
regarded
him
with
intense
interest
and
inclined
her
head
by
way
of
assent
i
never
think
of
my
friend
lord
highcliffe
without
recalling
those
significant
lines
of
william
watson
he
looked
at
her
and
be
it
said
that
his
eyes
were
fine
and
impressive
ones
when
he
showed
them
plainly
these
are
the
lines
do
not
ask
to
have
my
fill
of
wine
of
love
or
fame
i
do
not
for
a
little
ill
against
the
gods
exclaim
boon
of
fortune
i
implore
with
one
petition
kneel
least
caress
me
not
before
thou
break
me
on
thy
her
lip
quivered
and
her
long
lashes
concealed
her
eyes
they
are
fine
lines
she
said
they
fit
my
friend
lord
highcliffe
case
to
a
he
was
for
a
time
the
spoiled
darling
of
fortune
she
caressed
him
as
she
caresses
few
men
and
now
she
is
breaking
him
on
her
wheel
and
the
caresses
of
course
make
the
breaking
all
the
harder
to
bear
he
writes
most
interesting
letters
i
do
know
whether
you
care
about
farming
and
and
that
kind
of
thing
for
my
own
part
i
am
sublimely
ignorant
of
such
matters
i
can
lay
my
hand
upon
my
heart
and
say
i
know
a
cow
from
a
horse
but
nothing
shall
induce
me
to
go
further
if
you
are
interested
i
would
venture
to
offer
to
show
you
one
of
his
letters
there
is
nothing
in
them
of
a
private
character
her
heart
beat
still
more
quickly
he
saw
the
eager
light
flash
in
her
eyes
and
his
hand
went
to
his
breast
then
he
said
blandly
i
will
bring
one
next
time
we
meet
are
you
going
where
are
you
going
miss
heron
i
too
shall
be
going
there
probably
she
put
her
hand
to
her
lips
with
a
little
nervous
gesture
she
was
disappointed
she
thought
he
was
going
to
show
her
a
letter
then
and
there
i
am
going
to
lady
fitzharford
afternoon
to
try
over
some
music
with
her
she
said
hesitatingly
ah
yes
lady
fitzharford
is
a
good
friend
of
mine
he
said
shall
you
be
there
at
say
four
yes
said
ida
in
a
low
voice
did
you
say
that
orme
lord
highcliffe
is
well
oh
yes
he
is
all
right
now
replied
howard
he
has
been
ill
a
fever
of
some
kind
or
other
i
believe
but
he
has
recovered
he
is
a
monster
of
strength
as
you
may
have
heard
but
i
am
afraid
he
is
very
unhappy
something
on
what
he
calls
his
mind
he
is
not
very
intellectual
you
know
ida
shot
an
indignant
glance
at
him
which
made
howard
chuckle
inwardly
but
the
best
the
noblest
of
good
fellows
i
assure
you
miss
heron
i
give
anything
to
see
him
happy
ah
here
comes
a
gentleman
with
hurried
gait
and
distracted
countenance
he
is
looking
for
his
partner
alas
it
is
you
we
meet
then
at
lady
fitzharford
i
will
bring
my
friend
letter
but
i
do
sincerely
hope
it
wo
bore
you
he
bowed
his
adieux
and
left
her
and
left
the
house
for
the
ball
had
no
further
interest
for
him
all
the
way
home
he
pondered
over
the
case
that
she
loved
stafford
he
had
not
the
very
least
doubt
her
eyes
her
sudden
blushes
and
colour
her
voice
had
betrayed
her
he
has
loved
her
all
the
time
and
i
am
a
purblind
ass
not
to
have
seen
it
he
said
to
himself
with
cynical
as
he
climbed
up
to
his
rooms
they
were
modest
but
comfortable
rooms
in
picadilly
and
he
struck
a
match
before
he
opened
the
door
but
it
was
not
necessary
for
him
to
have
got
a
light
for
there
was
one
in
the
room
already
and
by
it
he
saw
a
figure
which
had
been
sitting
in
his
but
which
rose
and
exclaimed
howard
howard
held
his
breath
for
a
moment
then
said
with
exaggerated
calm
i
glad
you
found
the
cigars
and
the
whiskey
stafford
have
you
been
waiting
long
sorry
to
keep
you
howard
laughed
as
he
wrung
his
friend
hand
i
thought
i
should
surprise
you
old
man
but
i
flattered
myself
said
stafford
nothing
surprises
me
but
i
admit
to
being
rather
pleased
at
seeing
you
drawled
howard
pushing
him
gently
buck
in
the
chair
have
you
er
walked
from
australia
or
flown
stafford
stared
oh
i
see
you
mean
i
came
so
quickly
on
my
letter
i
started
directly
after
i
posted
it
but
lost
the
mail
at
southampton
i
i
got
a
restless
fit
and
was
obliged
to
come
got
it
now
drawled
howard
or
perhaps
the
journey
has
cooled
you
down
have
you
eaten
i
can
get
something
yes
yes
said
stafford
rather
impatiently
got
dinner
at
the
hotel
i
came
on
here
at
once
heard
you
gone
to
a
dance
and
thought
i
wait
i
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
howard
i
tell
you
all
my
news
some
other
time
not
that
there
much
to
tell
i
well
and
nourishing
as
you
see
i
want
you
to
go
down
to
bryndermere
i
dare
not
go
myself
not
yet
i
want
you
to
get
all
the
information
you
can
about
about
a
lady
miss
heron
of
herondale
how
very
strange
said
howard
innocently
do
you
know
i
have
just
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
a
miss
heron
of
herondale
stafford
sprang
to
his
feet
where
he
demanded
hotly
at
lady
clansford
ball
which
i
have
just
left
may
i
ask
why
you
are
so
interested
in
miss
heron
as
to
send
me
on
such
a
mission
i
love
her
said
stafford
briefly
i
can
not
live
without
her
tried
and
i
failed
i
loved
her
since
oh
i
ca
tell
you
i
want
to
know
what
she
is
doing
i
want
to
know
if
she
has
forgotten
me
if
there
is
any
hope
for
me
howard
looked
at
him
compassionately
and
whistled
softly
my
dear
old
man
he
said
with
an
air
of
reluctance
you
fly
rather
high
the
lady
you
speak
of
is
the
belle
of
the
present
season
she
is
the
admired
of
all
admirers
belted
earls
to
say
nothing
of
noble
dukes
are
at
her
feet
she
was
the
star
of
the
ball
which
i
have
just
left
if
i
may
say
so
i
think
you
were
very
unwise
to
leave
such
a
peerless
pearl
to
be
snapped
up
stafford
turned
away
from
him
and
stifled
a
groan
i
might
have
know
it
he
said
the
belle
of
the
season
well
why
not
there
is
no
one
more
beautiful
no
one
more
sweet
who
am
i
that
she
should
remember
me
what
am
i
rather
a
foolish
young
man
if
you
ask
me
said
howard
if
i
been
in
love
with
such
a
peerless
creature
i
should
have
left
her
to
go
tramping
after
cattle
in
australia
what
else
could
i
do
exclaimed
stafford
sternly
have
you
forgotten
that
i
was
not
set
free
that
when
when
death
his
voice
dropped
set
me
free
that
it
was
no
time
to
speak
of
love
to
another
woman
i
was
obliged
to
go
but
i
came
back
too
late
i
suppose
do
say
any
more
let
us
talk
of
something
else
you
are
looking
well
howard
yes
it
no
use
crying
over
spilt
milk
said
howard
with
a
sigh
oh
i
all
right
look
here
i
put
you
up
we
got
a
spare
room
now
mix
yourself
another
drink
and
light
up
another
cigar
not
bad
are
they
and
tell
me
all
you
been
doing
at
a
quarter
to
four
the
following
day
howard
put
in
his
appearance
at
lady
fitzharford
house
in
eaton
square
oh
i
so
glad
you
come
she
said
everybody
was
pleased
to
see
howard
you
are
just
the
man
i
want
that
sweet
creature
miss
heron
is
coming
here
directly
to
try
over
some
songs
with
me
i
going
to
sing
at
that
bazaar
you
know
and
as
you
know
something
of
music
is
there
anything
you
do
know
mr
howard
you
can
give
us
your
opinion
with
the
greatest
pleasure
my
dear
lady
responded
howard
but
on
two
conditions
one
that
you
do
take
my
opinion
the
other
that
you
leave
me
alone
with
miss
heron
directly
she
comes
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
lady
fitzharford
stared
at
him
are
you
going
to
propose
to
her
she
asked
with
a
smile
no
he
replied
i
am
tired
of
proposing
well
i
do
think
she
would
accept
you
said
lady
fitzharford
she
has
had
the
most
wonderful
offers
she
has
refused
lord
edwin
the
bannerdales
son
and
heir
and
i
believe
the
duke
of
glarn
i
know
i
know
said
howard
more
quickly
than
usual
i
can
hear
her
on
the
stairs
oh
vanish
my
dear
lady
an
you
love
me
lady
fitzharford
had
scarcely
left
the
room
laughing
and
not
a
little
puzzled
before
the
servant
admitted
ida
she
was
pale
and
the
look
of
sadness
in
her
eyes
was
even
more
palpable
than
on
the
preceding
night
she
blushed
for
an
instant
as
she
gave
her
hand
to
howard
lady
fitzharford
has
gone
to
get
her
music
miss
heron
he
said
she
bade
me
make
her
excuses
she
will
be
here
presently
it
is
so
good
of
you
to
remember
our
appointment
when
i
came
to
think
it
over
i
was
quite
ashamed
do
you
know
at
the
obtrusive
way
in
which
i
pressed
the
subject
of
my
friend
lord
highcliffe
condition
upon
you
but
mind
though
i
do
think
you
would
feel
interested
in
his
letter
he
has
a
knack
unintellectual
as
he
is
ida
rose
readily
to
the
fly
again
and
flashed
a
momentary
glance
of
indignation
at
him
from
her
violet
eyes
a
way
of
describing
scenes
and
incidents
in
a
kind
of
graphic
style
which
what
an
idiot
i
am
he
broke
off
to
exclaim
he
had
been
feeling
in
his
pocket
i
have
actually
left
the
letter
at
home
please
forgive
me
but
perhaps
you
will
regard
my
lapse
of
memory
as
affording
you
a
happy
escape
ida
lips
trembled
and
her
eyes
became
downcast
disappointment
was
eloquently
depicted
on
her
face
no
i
am
sorry
she
said
i
i
should
have
liked
to
have
seen
the
letter
would
you
really
he
purred
penitently
as
she
turned
away
to
the
window
then
i
will
go
and
get
it
my
rooms
are
only
a
short
distance
oh
pray
do
trouble
she
said
so
faintly
that
howard
found
it
difficult
not
to
smile
not
at
all
he
said
politely
and
left
the
room
as
he
went
down
the
stairs
he
glanced
at
his
watch
and
muttered
now
if
the
young
idiot
is
up
to
time
at
that
moment
there
was
a
knock
at
the
the
servant
opened
it
and
stafford
entered
with
a
gloomy
countenance
and
a
reluctant
gait
i
come
he
said
rather
morosely
though
i
do
know
why
you
should
have
insisted
upon
my
doing
so
or
what
good
it
will
do
me
to
hear
about
her
he
added
in
a
low
voice
as
they
followed
the
servant
up
the
stairs
as
the
man
touched
the
handle
of
the
door
howard
said
go
in
my
dear
fellow
i
left
my
in
my
overcoat
in
the
hall
back
in
a
moment
with
a
frown
of
annoyance
stafford
hesitated
and
looked
after
him
then
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
he
obeyed
and
entered
the
room
they
uttered
no
cry
of
surprise
of
joy
they
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
each
other
with
their
hearts
in
their
eyes
it
was
the
moment
that
bridged
over
all
the
weary
months
of
waiting
of
longing
of
doubts
and
fears
of
hope
that
seemed
too
faint
for
hope
and
but
a
mockery
of
despair
he
had
no
need
to
ask
her
if
she
loved
him
her
face
was
eloquent
of
the
truth
and
her
eyes
reflected
the
love
that
glowed
in
his
he
had
got
hold
of
her
hand
before
she
knew
it
had
drawn
her
to
him
and
utterly
regardless
of
the
fact
that
he
was
in
a
strange
house
that
they
might
be
interrupted
any
moment
he
kissed
her
passionately
with
all
the
passion
that
had
been
stored
up
for
so
long
ida
he
said
as
he
bent
over
her
and
pressed
her
to
him
i
have
come
back
i
can
not
live
without
you
ah
but
you
know
that
you
know
that
is
it
too
late
it
is
not
too
late
no
it
is
not
too
late
she
whispered
i
i
did
not
know
whether
you
would
come
but
i
have
been
waiting
i
should
have
waited
all
my
life
but
the
time
has
been
very
long
stafford
at
the
end
of
the
quarter
of
an
hour
for
which
howard
had
bargained
lady
fitzharford
opened
the
door
of
the
inner
room
softly
so
softly
that
seeing
miss
heron
in
the
arms
of
a
stalwart
young
man
and
apparently
quite
content
to
be
there
her
ladyship
discreetly
closed
the
door
again
and
going
round
by
the
inner
room
found
howard
seated
on
the
stairs
she
looked
at
him
with
amazement
bewilderment
are
you
mad
she
exclaimed
in
a
whisper
howard
smiled
at
her
blandly
no
he
said
with
a
backward
jerk
of
his
head
but
they
are
told
it
a
delicious
kind
of
madness
worth
all
your
sanity
do
not
let
us
disturb
them
come
and
sit
down
beside
me
until
the
time
is
up
he
glanced
at
his
watch
they
have
still
three
minutes
with
a
suppressed
laugh
she
sat
down
beside
him
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
she
said
to
play
me
such
a
trick
but
oh
how
happy
they
look
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
my
dear
lady
he
said
but
i
should
have
been
more
ashamed
of
myself
if
i
had
do
they
look
happy
we
will
go
in
and
see
presently
it
will
be
my
great
reward
but
i
should
like
to
give
them
another
five
minutes
dear
lady
for
i
assure
you
on
my
word
of
honour
that
i
was
once
young
myself
the
end
