much
when
i
received
your
invitation
to
come
here
nodded
elfreda

has
taken
full
possession
of
me
grace
what
is
the
big
idea
urged
anne
nesbit
eagerly
far
as
i
am
concerned
no
plans
have
been
made
replied
grace
original
suggestion
may
have
been
mine
that
is
the
suggestion
that
we
get
together
for
a
real
outing
from
that
nucleus
hippy
says
he
has
worked
out
a
plan
that
promises
entertainment
health
and
adventure
for
the
jaded
overton

after
their
strenuous

service
hippy
and

will
be
here
in

moments
he
will
tell
you
all
about
mystery
murmured
emma
me
ask
you
girls
something
resumed
grace
we
returned
from
france
where
we
all
did
our
bit
has
each
of
you
been
perfectly
contented
with
the
simple
life
well
content
to
remain
at
home
without
feeling
one
little
yearning
to
see
something
stirring
search
your
innermost
consciousness
and
tell
me
what
you
find
there
in
answer
to
my
for
a
moment
no
one
essayed
an
answer
then
elfreda
spoke
up
be
frank
with
you
loyalheart
i
have
been
perfectly
miserable
declared
miss
briggs
thoughtfully
grace
nodded
and
smiled
france
amid
the
activity
and
excitement
of
war
not
to
speak
of
the
peril
i
was
positive
that
once
out
of
it
once
back
in
my
peaceful
home
i
never
again
should
feel
the
slightest
inclination
to
wander
continued
elfreda
a
few
months
following
my
return
from
the
war
zone
i
really
was
contented
delightfully
so
luxuriously
so
i
might
say
for
i
was
the
lazy
life
of
reilley
as
the
doughboys
say
finally
i
awakened
from
my
dream
i
was
restless
ill
at
ease
while
away
to
war
my
law
practice
of
course
had
gone
to
smash
it
had
not
met
me
at
the
train
upon
my
return
either
and
the
way
i
felt
i
care
but
upon
awakening
i
realized
that
what
i
needed
was
activity
however
the
sort
of
activity
that
my
particular
ailment
demanded
was
not
at
hand
and
i
was
on
the
verge
of
doing
something
desperate
when
your
letter
came
asking
me
to
join
our
friends
at
your
home
to
talk
over
a
vacation
trip
grace
harlowe
you
are
a
life
saver
that
is
the
truth
and
the
whole
truth
finished
elfreda
amid
laughter
is
what
i
say
or
rather
what
i
probably
should
have
said
had
i
the
eloquence
of
our
legal
friend
elfreda
briggs
bubbled
emma
me
excitement
or
i
die
grace
glanced
at
anne
who
nodded
and
smiled
follow
where
you
lead
loyalheart
said
anne
bad
that
the
rest
of
the
unit
are
unable
to
be
with
us
but
those
not
otherwise
engaged
are
mostly
roaming
over
the
face
of
the
earth
just
as
we
are
proposing
to
do
by
the
way
what
are
we
to
do
where
are
we
to
go
and
how
are
all
suffering
a
reaction
from
the
war
but
a
strenuous
few
weeks
in
the
open
surely
will
settle
us
down
said
grace
come
hippy
and
nora
now
you
will
know
all
about
it
she
added
stepping
to
the
veranda
to
greet
the
newcomers
nora
wingate
how
are
you
lieutenant
present
or
accounted
for
answered
hippy
jovially
to
meet
you
ladies
he
greeted
bowing
profoundly
as
he
entered

house

so
pleased
over
anything

your

take
it
that
you
are

big
vacation
questioned
hippy
addressing
himself
to
emma
dean
you
going
to
lead
the
party
demanded
emma
may
have
that
hippy
bowed
humbly
me
out
emphasized
emma
no
no
protested
anne
and
elfreda
laughingly
jumping
at
conclusions
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
for
us
to
listen
to
lieutenant
plan
suggested
grace
rising
is
being
served
come
we
can
talk
while
we
eat
she
added
leading
the
way
to
the
dining
room
whose
windows
overlooked
the
sloping
green
lawns
of
grace
home
elfreda
anne
and
emma
had
within
the
hour
arrived
at
haven
home
where
grace
had
been
living
quietly
and
restfully
since
her
return
from
france
in
which
country
she
and
her
friends
of
the
overton
unit
had
been
serving
with
the
red
cross
during
the
closing
year
of
the
war
husband
captain
tom
gray
was
still
in
russia
where
he
had
been
sent
from
france
on
a
military
mission
and
yvonne
her
adopted
daughter
was
a
pupil
in
a
private
school
in
new
england
so
she
felt
free
to
invite
the
girls
of
her
unit
to
join
with
her
in
a
outing
that
would
offer
both
recreation
and
adventure
anne
nesbit
elfreda
briggs
and
emma
dean
were
the
only
members
of
the
unit
who
had
not
already
made
their
plans
for
the
summer
while
grace
would
have
been
pleased
to
have
all
the
girls
of
the
overton
unit
join
in
her
proposed
outing
she
was
just
as
well
pleased
that
her
invitation
had
not
been
more
generally
accepted
the
present
party
was
of
about
the
right
size
as
she
reasoned
it
then
again
the
members
of
the
party
had
been
close
associates
for
many
years
they
had
shared
their
girlhood
joys
and
sorrows
they
had
suffered
together
in
those
desperate
days
in
france
when
it
seemed
to
them
that
the
very
universe
were
rending
itself
asunder
and
from
all
this
had
been
born
a
better
understanding
of
each
other
and
a
greater
love
and
respect
it
was
therefore
a
happy
gathering
that
sat
down
to
dinner
in
grace
oakdale
home
on
that
balmy
afternoon
for
a
time
there
was
chatter
and
laughter
the
reviving
of
old
college
and
war
memories
intermingled
with
occasional
chaffing
of
hippy
wingate
always
a
shining
mark
for
the
overton
teasing
finally
announced
grace
has
a
dark
secret
locked
in
his
heart
to
be
brought
to
light
only
when
we
girls
are
could
see
the
moment
he
came
in
that
he
had
interrupted
elfreda
always
was
a
poor
what
nora
says
replied
hippy
sheepishly
believe
that
you
girls
are
not
all
aware
of
the
fact
that
hippy
is
now
a
man
of
affairs
resumed
grace
his
words
must
be
given
weight
accordingly
hippy
being
too
modest
to
tell
you
about
it
himself
i
would
have
you
all
know
that
upon
his
return
from
the
war
he
found
himself
a
rich
man
following
the
death
of
a
wealthy
uncle
who
was
so
proud
of
our
flying
great
achievements
in
the
war
that
he
left
hippy
all
his
worldly
possessions
our
hippy
it
is
rumored
is
now
lying
awake
nights
trying
to
devise
new
ways
to
spend
his
no
nothing
like
that
protested
hippy
wingate
with
a
disapproving
shake
of
the
head
i
really
am
trying
to
figure
out
is
how
to
spend
it
that
is
not
all
at
once
of
course
so
far
as
my
dear
friends
are
concerned
that
is
another
matter
added
hippy
quite
seriously
ancestors
originated
in
missouri
you
will
have
to
demonstrate
observed
emma
dean
amid
much
laughter
we
are
at
the
moment
most
interested
in
is
the
dark
secret
you
have
something
to
say
to
us
reminded
miss
briggs
hippy
do
not
keep
us
in
suspense
urged
grace
on
darling
they
will
walk
out
and
leave
you
if
you
start
pretty
soon
warned
nora
began
lieutenant
wingate
you
going
to
make
a
speech
demanded
emma
apprehensively
i
am
about
to
say
will
answer
your
question
grace
has
been
suggesting
that
this
outfit
get
together
and
spend
the
latter
part
of
the
summer
in
the
open
that
set
my
brain
in
what
interrupted
emma
grace
laughed
merrily
and
then
begged
pardon
my
return
from
the
war
resumed
hippy
unheeding
the
interruption
friend
captain
jamieson
of
the
state
constabulary
asked
me
to
volunteer
to
serve
in
the
troop
with
him
on
strike
duty
i
did
so
girls
you
have
no
idea
of
the
joy
i
found
in
leather
as
the
horsemen
call
it
horseback
riding
after
that
experience
with
the
troop
when
grace
was
speaking
about
an
outing
in
the
open
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
overton
unit
might
work
off
its
surplus
energy
in
the
saddle
and
at
the
same
time
have
a
glorious
outing
brown
eyes
tell
them
of
your
experience
in
the
grace
related
how
after
having
been
made
an
honorary
member
of
the
troop
she
had
taken
up
horseback
riding
and
what
a
wonderful
revelation
it
had
been
to
her
my
word
for
it
too
brown
eyes
already
is
as
fine
a
rider
as
there
is
in
the
troop
the
captain
says
she
is
a
natural
born
horsewoman
declared
hippy
with
enthusiasm
my
nora
promises
that
hereafter
riding
horseback
is
to
be
her
own
principal
recreation
how
many
of
you
girls
ride
elfreda
and
anne
said
they
had
ridden
some
when
younger
but
not
recently
emma
dean
owned
a
pony
she
said
but
had
not
been
on
its
back
in
more
than
two
years
exclaimed
lieutenant
wingate
all
at
least
know
how
to
stick
on
leather
so
we
will
proceed
to
the
next
stage
of
the
journey
my
great
secret
is
no
longer
a
secret
you
already
know
what
i
am
about
to
propose
do
you
girls
wish
to
join
out
with
us
for
a
month
or
so
in
the
saddle
go
where
questioned
elfreda
is
for
us
girls
to
decide
upon
interjected
grace
first
question
to
be
settled
is
who
will
go
in
favor
of
taking
a
horseback
trip
say
contrary
cried
hippy
the
answer
was
a
chorus
of
ayes
ayes
have
it
we
go
announced
the
lieutenant
smiling
his
pleasure
at
the
decision
you
a
suggestion
to
offer
as
to
where
we
might
go
asked
anne
was
my
thought
that
we
might
tour
new
england
answered
the
lieutenant
england
cried
emma
dean
any
fun
in
doing
that
when
i
go
out
for
adventure
i
wish
the
real
thing
adventure
in
new
england
huh
it
existed
in
new
england
since
the
indians
put
down
an
arrow
barrage
on
the
pilgrim
fathers
you
will
have
to
think
of
something
more
exciting
than
new
england
if
you
expect
me
to
go
with
do
we
get
the
saddle
horses
was
query
will
arrange
for
that
grace
informed
her
agree
with
emma
that
so
long
as
we
are
going
out
for
adventure
we
should
get
as
far
from
the
beaten
paths
as
possible
roughing
it
in
the
real
meaning
of
the
term
is
what
we
girls
is
what
i
say
cried
emma
weak
lemonade
trips
for
me
give
me
a
wild
west
or
give
me
an
am
certain
that
loyalheart
has
a
suggestion
to
offer
said
miss
briggs
nodding
in
direction
i
have
admitted
grace
advice
is
that
we
adopt
suggestion
and
go
west
speaking
for
myself
there
is
one
place
out
there
that
always
has
held
a
great
fascination
for
me
i
refer
to
the
old
apache
trail
in
arizona
from
what
i
have
read
of
that
part
of
the
country
one
should
be
able
to
find
adventure
in
a
horseback
journey
over
the
old
trail
going
so
far
by
train
before
we
start
with
horses
will
make
it
rather
an
expensive
trip
but
i
do
not
believe
it
will
be
beyond
our
eyes
widened
are
there
indians
there
bush
hides
a
lurking
apache
lieutenant
wingate
gravely
informed
her
exclaimed
emma
under
her
breath
do
not
believe
it
is
quite
so
alarming
as
that
laughed
grace
though
there
are
indians
we
probably
shall
not
be
troubled
by
them
are
there
any
further
suggestions
girls
apache
trail
sounds
interesting
to
me
admitted
anne
interesting
and
alarming
averred
elfreda
we
know
from
past
experiences
that
trouble
always
goes
hand
in
hand
with
grace
harlowe
so
we
are
fully
prepared
in
advance
for
whatever
may
come
to
us
what
do
we
take
with
us
and
how
are
we
to
dress
has
occurred
to
me
that
we
can
wear
our
old
army
uniforms
without
insignia
replied
grace
will
be
appropriate
for
riding
but
we
should
wear
campaign
hats
in
place
of
our
overseas
caps
such
changes
of
clothing
as
we
shall
require
can
be
carried
in
our
steamer
trunks
which
we
will
send
ahead
by
express
my
advice
is
not
to
carry
any
finery
let
us
keep
in
the
simple
atmosphere
at
all
times
bearing
in
mind
that
this
will
not
be
a
pullman
car
outing
after
we
reach
our
starting
point
how
soon
can
you
girls
be
ready
elfreda
said
she
would
be
prepared
to
leave
in
about
ten
days
having
some
office
legal
matters
to
clear
up
before
going
away
the
others
said
they
could
be
ready
in
even
less
time
than
that
so
it
was
decided
that
they
should
meet
at
oakdale
for
the
start
for
the
west
on
august
first
hippy
in
the
meantime
would
so
far
as
possible
arrange
by
correspondence
for
the
horses
they
were
to
ride
and
for
such
equipment
as
had
to
do
with
his
part
in
the
preparations
the
following
few
days
were
busy
ones
for
all
between
riding
horseback
taking
short
gallops
out
into
the
country
on
such
mounts
as
they
could
find
at
livery
stables
and
planning
for
their
vacation
in
the
saddle
on
these
rides
hippy
and
grace
taught
the
others
such
riding
points
as
they
had
learned
in
their
riding
experiences
all
save
emma
quickly
adapting
themselves
to
the
saddle
so
that
the
vacation
at
haven
home
lengthened
to
twelve
days
before
elfreda
and
emma
entrained
for
home
anne
remained
with
grace
there
being
no
reason
why
she
should
return
home
as
her
husband
still
in
the
service
of
his
country
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
in
the
intervening
days
before
the
start
for
the
west
hippy
corresponded
by
wire
and
letter
with
the
postmaster
at
globe
arizona
who
informed
the
lieutenant
that
there
were
two
stock
farms
near
that
place
where
mounts
suitable
for
the
overton
needs
might
be
purchased
or
hired
at
reasonable
prices
it
was
decided
however
that
no
definite
arrangement
for
horses
should
be
made
until
hippy
had
had
opportunity
to
look
them
over
with
all
the
girls
present
to
approve
of
his
selection
grace
having
completed
most
of
her
preparations
for
their
outing
now
made
a
brief
journey
to
the
city
to
visit
yvonne
at
her
school
returning
home
in
time
to
welcome
elfreda
and
emma
who
arrived
at
oakdale
looking
trim
and
pretty
in
their
new
serge
traveling
suits
grace
looked
her
two
friends
over
critically
on
their
arrival
but
not
quite
suitable
for
horseback
riding
she
observed
referring
to
their
costumes
riding
suits
are
in
our
steamer
trunks
explained
elfreda
know
you
said
we
were
not
to
take
any
finery
along
but
surely
while
traveling
on
a
train
we
should
wear
something
other
than
our
grace
admitted
that
perhaps
this
would
be
advisable
and
decided
that
the
party
would
be
less
conspicuous
in
traveling
clothes
it
was
a
merry
company
at
haven
home
that
evening
the
eve
of
the
overton
departure
for
the
west
on
what
each
one
instinctively
felt
was
destined
to
be
an
eventful
journey
several
neighbors
came
in
and
there
was
music
with
irish
songs
by
nora
a
characteristic
speech
from
the
lips
of
lieutenant
wingate
followed
by
dancing
refreshments
and
much
chatter
until
a
late
hour
after
the
neighbors
had
said
their
the
overton
girls
put
the
finishing
touches
to
their
packing
and
closed
their
trunks
be
opened
when
we
reach
arizona
announced
grace
placing
her
trunk
key
in
her
purse
smiling
at
her
friends
with
that
rare
smile
that
so
attracted
people
to
her
quite
a
party
was
at
the
station
to
see
the
outfit
off
next
morning
though
naturally
the
crowd
was
neither
so
great
nor
so
boisterous
as
when
upon
her
arrival
home
from
the
war
grace
harlowe
had
been
literally
carried
from
the
train
to
her
home
a
heroine
not
in
theory
but
in
fact
as
the
crosses
of
war
of
two
nations
pinned
to
her
blouse
bore
evidence
farewells
were
waved
from
car
windows
the
tall
maples
and
spreading
elms
of
haven
home
melted
into
the
distance
as
the
journey
toward
the
setting
sun
was
begun
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
vacation
of
ours
is
not
to
be
an
unalloyed
sweet
dream
sighed
elfreda
briggs
settling
herself
resignedly
for
the
journey
chapter
ii
on
the
overland
coach
girls
made
a
perfectly
marvelous
discovery
cried
grace
harlowe
as
she
burst
into
the
parlor
of
the
hotel
at
globe
arizona
on
the
morning
following
their
arrival
from
the
east
means
watch
your
step
overton
unit
reminded
elfreda
briggs
is
the
nature
of
your
discovery
a
long
lost
brother
or
something
of
that
sort
discovery
is
a
genuine
old
deadwood
stagecoach
grace
informed
her
companions
elfreda
regarded
her
narrowly
flying
lieutenant
hippy
wingate
is
examining
it
now
to
see
if
it
is
really
fit
for
use
continued
grace
with
no
abatement
of
her
enthusiasm
deadwood
stagecoach
wondered
emma
dean
is
the
kind
of
coach
they
used
in
the
old
stagecoach
days
of
the
early
west
elfreda
briggs
explained
the
kind
that
the
bandits
used
to
hold
up
and
rob
the
passengers
that
husband
of
mine
used
to
read
all
about
it
when
he
was
a
youngster
he
declares
that
had
the
war
not
come
along
when
it
did
he
might
have
been
a
bandit
himself
asserted
nora
wingate
does
he
want
to
look
over
that
old
stagecoach
for
she
demanded
suspiciously
is
thinking
of
taking
a
ride
in
it
smiled
grace
to
me
girls
i
will
tell
you
what
hippy
and
i
have
to
is
about
time
muttered
elfreda
suggestion
is
resumed
grace
we
girls
take
a
trip
in
the
deadwood
coach
say
out
as
far
as
the
apache
lodge
on
the
trail
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
not
at
least
make
a
night
drive
say
up
to
about
midnight
go
into
camp
for
a
few
sleep
and
then
drive
back
to
globe
in
the
early
morning
should
we
like
the
coaching
well
enough
we
can
go
on
and
do
the
entire
hundred
and
twenty
miles
of
the
old
apache
trail
in
that
is
all
very
well
but
what
about
the
ponies
that
the
lieutenant
has
hired
for
the
ride
over
the
trail
questioned
anne
can
have
the
ponies
led
through
to
phœnix
and
ride
them
back
camping
along
the
way
back
for
the
rest
of
our
vacation
replied
grace
will
arrange
that
matter
and
make
a
deal
with
the
stagecoach
owner
after
he
has
carefully
looked
the
old
wagon
over
to
make
certain
that
it
will
go
through
the
trip
without
falling
think
it
will
be
a
perfectly
safe
thing
to
do
do
you
grace
questioned
elfreda
briggs
if
the
stagecoach
holds
together
answered
grace
smilingly
muttered
elfreda
under
her
breath
grace
suppose
a
band
of
bad
men
hold
us
up
and
rob
us
urged
emma
apprehensively
danger
whatever
my
dear
those
days
have
passed
in
the
great
west
as
have
the
savage
apaches
of
olden
time
though
the
trip
will
take
us
over
the
ground
on
which
they
fought
many
fierce
battles
ah
here
comes
hippy
now
how
about
it
lieutenant
set
brown
eyes
the
owner
of
the
stagecoach
says
he
has
a
new
set
of
wheels
that
he
will
put
on
as
the
old
ones
would
not
stand
up
under
the
load
we
shall
have
otherwise
the
old
rattler
is
good
for
many
a
journey
over
the
trail
i
think
the
owner
got
a
good
idea
from
us
and
that
he
will
make
the
deadwood
stagecoach
trip
a
regular
attraction
for
tourists
what
do
you
say
girls
is
the
one
to
say
averred
elfreda
our
journey
out
here
you
will
remember
that
we
decided
she
should
be
our
captain
i
may
have
my
doubts
about
the
advisability
of
the
proposed
coaching
trip
but
i
will
agree
to
it
with
a
certain
mental
reservation
go
you
seen
the
owner
of
the
ponies
asked
grace
turning
to
lieutenant
wingate
hippy
nodded
care
what
we
do
so
long
as
he
gets
his
will
the
stagecoach
be
ready
questioned
grace
an
hour
if
you
decide
to
make
the
is
all
very
well
so
far
as
it
goes
observed
nora
wingate
i
wish
to
ask
is
how
are
we
going
to
sleep
and
eat
shall
take
with
us
rations
and
a
small
tent
which
can
be
carried
on
the
roof
of
the
stagecoach
hippy
can
sleep
on
the
floor
of
the
coach
and
we
girls
will
sleep
in
the
tent
grace
informed
her
companions
old
place
is
good
enough
for
hippy
complained
lieutenant
wingate
man
like
yourself
who
has
slept
on
a
cloud
hovering
over
the
german
lines
on
the
french
front
ought
not
to
complain
about
having
to
sleep
on
nice
soft
blankets
on
the
floor
of
a
stagecoach
teased
grace
complaining
retorted
hippy
is
the
verdict
there
are
objections
which
argument
can
not
overcome
i
shall
decide
for
taking
the
stagecoach
announced
grace
please
give
voice
to
your
preferences
and
be
quick
about
it
urged
hippy
the
vote
was
unanimous
for
the
stagecoach
eyes
will
you
attend
to
getting
the
food
he
asked
with
assistance
we
will
go
shopping
at
once
nora
dear
hippy
please
tell
the
stagecoach
man
that
we
will
take
the
coach
and
that
we
shall
be
ready
to
leave
at
four
this
afternoon
please
see
that
the
a
tent
is
shipped
aboard
our
craft
by
the
way
what
does
he
propose
to
charge
us
for
the
trip
out
and
back
dollars
replied
hippy
lieutenant
wingate
added
that
if
grace
would
give
him
a
memorandum
of
exactly
what
she
wished
to
carry
along
he
would
get
the
equipment
together
at
once
will
do
that
now
replied
grace
reflection
i
would
suggest
that
you
tell
the
man
who
owns
the
ponies
we
have
hired
to
hold
the
animals
here
as
we
shall
be
back
here
i
have
about
decided
that
one
night
with
the
stagecoach
will
give
us
all
the
thrills
we
are
looking
for
in
that
direction
anyway
we
are
out
here
to
ride
horseback
so
you
girls
must
not
look
too
hard
for
comfort
in
your
surroundings
riding
in
this
part
of
the
country
is
work
and
you
will
discover
that
it
is
not
at
all
like
galloping
about
a
ring
in
a
riding
academy
or
pleasant
jaunts
through
shady
country
a
trip
in
a
luxurious
automobile
suggested
elfreda
a
flight
into
the
blue
in
a
plane
added
hippy
me
the
air
every
time
the
freedom
of
the
skies
the
azure
and
the
birds
and
the
out
your
motor
is
going
to
stall
warned
emma
dean
amid
general
laughter
agree
with
you
nodded
elfreda
lieutenant
wingate
went
out
laughing
and
chuckling
to
himself
and
after
his
departure
grace
assigned
their
duties
to
each
of
the
girls
then
herself
started
out
with
nora
to
purchase
supplies
these
consisted
of
a
small
quantity
of
canned
goods
potatoes
bacon
coffee
and
salt
and
pepper
with
a
few
other
odds
and
ends
all
of
which
grace
ordered
done
up
in
a
large
package
and
delivered
to
the
stagecoach
man
the
purchases
were
quickly
made
and
within
a
very
short
time
grace
and
nora
were
back
at
the
hotel
the
drosky
drive
up
to
the
hotel
for
us
greeted
emma
dean
as
the
two
girls
entered
does
not
i
should
not
care
to
make
our
outfit
so
conspicuous
as
that
rebuked
grace
fiddlesticks
what
is
the
use
of
making
a
splurge
when
there
is
no
one
to
see
it
grumbled
emma
child
cried
irish
nora
is
no
traveling
show
for
the
benefit
of
the
is
perfectly
right
agreed
grace
are
here
for
our
own
enjoyment
and
though
perhaps
we
may
be
a
show
in
ourselves
we
do
not
propose
to
perform
for
the
edification
of
the
public
if
we
can
avoid
is
this
i
hear
about
a
show
cried
elfreda
at
that
moment
entering
the
hotel
parlor
with
anne
nora
explained
that
emma
wished
to
drive
away
in
style
just
wait
emma
until
we
return
from
this
trip
of
ours
if
we
do
not
show
the
globites
something
new
in
styles
after
we
have
passed
through
the
refining
influences
of
the
apache
trail
i
shall
admit
that
i
am
not
a
prophetess
laughed
elfreda
just
now
saw
hippy
with
his
coat
off
working
on
that
old
ark
that
he
calls
a
stagecoach
before
an
admiring
audience
of
natives
he
making
himself
conspicuous
are
we
expected
to
trust
life
and
limb
to
that
ancient
craft
grace
harlowe
are
and
we
shall
answered
grace
i
think
those
of
you
who
have
property
had
better
make
your
wills
before
embarking
nora
this
applies
especially
to
you
and
hippy
who
so
recently
have
come
into
a
fortune
grace
made
her
will
before
going
overseas
to
drive
an
ambulance
on
the
french
front
but
emma
having
spent
all
her
money
on
finery
had
no
need
to
make
a
about
yourself
questioned
grace
teasingly
am
merely
a
struggling
young
lawyeress
who
supposed
to
have
money
to
will
and
who
most
assuredly
has
no
clients
to
pay
her
any
it
about
time
for
luncheon
grace
said
it
was
but
that
they
were
waiting
for
hippy
so
that
all
might
sit
down
together
lieutenant
wingate
came
in
shortly
after
that
covered
with
dirt
and
a
beauty
spot
on
one
cheek
are
a
sight
hippy
wingate
chided
grace
did
you
get
yourself
in
such
a
condition
the
man
grease
the
go
right
up
to
our
room
and
make
yourself
fit
to
sit
down
with
civilized
persons
ordered
nora
am
ashamed
to
own
you
as
my
that
a
fine
way
to
order
around
a
fellow
who
has
fought
the
boche
on
high
and
who
will
go
down
in
history
as
a
brave
air
fighter
teased
anne
husbands
have
to
be
ordered
mine
is
one
of
them
answered
nora
giving
ear
a
tweak
run
along
little
hippy
kissed
nora
and
ran
upstairs
laughing
to
himself
scolding
did
not
even
penetrate
skin
deep
with
lieutenant
wingate
nor
did
she
intend
that
it
should
soon
after
that
the
overton
college
girls
filed
into
the
dining
room
where
a
number
of
tourists
were
having
luncheon
the
girls
in
their
overseas
uniforms
attracted
attention
at
once
many
of
the
guests
having
been
told
who
the
young
women
with
the
tanned
faces
and
familiar
uniforms
were
the
guests
also
had
been
informed
that
the
man
with
the
party
was
lieutenant
wingate
a
noted
american
air
fighter
who
stood
high
up
in
the
list
of
those
who
had
downed
more
than
twenty
enemy
planes
as
she
took
her
seat
at
the
table
grace
bowed
smilingly
to
two
ladies
who
had
come
in
on
the
train
with
them
that
morning
what
shall
we
eat
she
asked
for
myself
as
a
modest
person
i
think
i
shall
begin
at
the
top
of
the
menu
and
eat
my
way
all
the
way
down
to
the
bottom
observed
hippy
solemnly
amid
the
laughter
of
the
others
luncheon
finished
the
party
went
out
and
for
a
look
at
the
ponies
that
hippy
had
hired
for
the
trip
over
the
old
apache
trail
on
which
journey
they
would
have
started
on
the
following
morning
had
grace
not
chanced
to
discover
the
old
deadwood
stagecoach
at
three
that
afternoon
the
party
of
overton
girls
loaded
their
belongings
such
as
would
be
needed
for
a
hour
jaunt
into
an
automobile
and
drove
to
the
stable
where
the
stage
driver
ike
fairweather
by
name
was
preparing
to
harness
up
the
four
horses
that
were
to
draw
the
coach
hippy
removed
his
coat
and
assisted
in
the
operations
while
the
girls
inspected
the
stagecoach
and
stowed
away
their
belongings
nose
went
up
ever
so
little
when
she
peered
into
the
interior
of
the
vehicle
observing
the
old
rickety
wooden
seats
the
tattered
curtains
and
the
cracks
in
the
warped
flooring
this
old
ark
lasts
until
we
get
out
of
town
i
am
no
prophet
she
declared
if
it
breaks
down
can
walk
just
as
some
of
us
have
had
to
do
in
france
when
an
ambulance
went
out
of
commission
answered
grace
laughingly
she
then
placed
blankets
on
the
hardwood
seats
and
packed
their
provisions
underneath
by
this
time
ike
was
hooking
up
the
four
horses
that
he
was
an
experienced
man
grace
saw
after
observing
him
critically
for
a
few
moments
and
she
was
certain
that
they
could
safely
trust
themselves
to
his
driving
have
a
lurking
idea
that
the
girls
of
this
outfit
are
in
for
a
ride
that
they
will
not
soon
forget
even
though
things
look
favorable
she
thought
smiling
to
herself
harlowe
what
are
you
laughing
at
demanded
anne
was
thinking
of
something
very
very
funny
replied
grace
me
in
on
the
joke
please
begged
emma
now
perhaps
later
elfreda
regarded
her
frowningly
you
play
any
tricks
on
us
loyalheart
you
will
be
sorry
warned
miss
briggs
can
you
even
suggest
such
a
thing
cried
grace
you
ever
know
me
to
play
pranks
on
my
friends
have
been
occasions
when
suspicions
assumed
real
shapes
in
my
mind
retorted
elfreda
to
it
that
this
is
not
one
of
those
occasions
i
believe
we
are
about
ready
to
make
our
start
fairweather
where
is
there
a
good
place
for
us
to
make
camp
i
do
not
think
we
should
try
to
make
the
lodge
this
evening
all
we
desire
is
to
take
the
coach
into
the
mountains
make
camp
and
come
back
in
the
early
morning
it
matter
whether
or
not
we
go
so
far
as
the
valley
or
just
beyond
i
reckon
is
as
good
as
any
place
on
the
trail
observed
the
driver
reflectively
stroking
his
whiskers
far
is
that
from
here
i
mean
squaw
valley
onto
thirty
mile
i
i
think
will
be
about
as
much
of
a
trip
as
my
companions
can
stand
so
we
will
say
squaw
valley
or
the
next
available
point
i
leave
the
selection
of
the
camping
place
to
your
judgment
what
time
do
you
think
we
shall
reach
the
valley
ten
have
to
go
slow
when
we
get
into
the
hills
we
bump
right
smart
after
globe
sharp
turns
and
narrow
trail
in
spots
but
it
much
like
the
days
when
i
driv
a
coach
four
in
the
hills
carried
the
mail
a
weather
eye
out
for
bandits
since
then
them
buzz
wagons
has
took
all
the
starch
out
of
ever
drive
one
drove
an
ambulance
at
the
front
for
nearly
a
year
of
the
war
answered
grace
quietly
say
ike
regarded
the
slender
figure
of
the
young
overton
girl
his
gaze
finally
coming
to
rest
on
her
face
to
look
you
over
got
a
mighty
steady
eye
a
good
jaw
seen
thet
kind
before
sometimes
behind
a
gun
thet
kind
is
fine
till
you
get
them
riled
then
look
out
for
the
where
you
to
ride
with
you
until
we
reach
squaw
valley
if
i
may
answered
grace
smilingly
to
have
you
all
aboard
get
in
with
the
girls
hippy
later
on
you
and
i
will
change
seats
if
that
will
suit
you
said
grace
the
lieutenant
stood
aside
until
the
four
girls
were
safely
stowed
away
in
the
stagecoach
grace
in
the
meantime
having
swung
herself
up
to
the
front
seat
with
the
driver
the
door
slammed
ike
cracked
his
whip
and
the
coach
started
with
a
jolt
that
brought
strong
protest
from
the
passengers
down
below
there
you
shouted
hippy
thrusting
his
head
out
got
my
safety
belt
on
so
take
off
like
that
again
or
you
will
throw
me
on
lieutenant
urged
grace
her
laughing
eyes
peering
over
the
edge
of
the
coach
into
the
red
perspiring
face
of
hippy
wingate
is
the
way
i
had
to
do
when
i
went
flying
with
you
in
france
if
you
will
recall
you
said
yesterday
that
you
must
have
excitement
i
am
simply
providing
it
for
you
and
i
have
an
idea
you
will
get
all
you
wish
by
the
time
we
have
done
with
this
the
lieutenant
drew
in
his
head
and
they
heard
nothing
more
from
him
for
some
time
the
deadwood
stagecoach
swept
out
with
a
rattle
and
a
clatter
and
a
groaning
in
every
joint
that
aroused
the
apprehension
not
only
of
its
passengers
but
of
persons
on
the
streets
who
paused
to
see
the
outfit
wheel
past
them
the
four
horses
at
a
brisk
trot
leaving
the
town
quickly
behind
them
the
stagecoach
swept
out
into
the
open
the
smoke
of
the
old
dominion
and
inquisition
smelting
furnaces
hung
gray
against
the
sky
but
the
overton
girls
were
soon
past
the
tall
black
buildings
of
cooling
copper
riding
away
toward
the
west
at
a
pace
that
caused
the
stagecoach
to
complain
even
more
bitterly
than
before
it
was
to
be
a
mere
outing
a
jaunt
in
an
historic
old
stagecoach
over
an
equally
historic
trail
but
that
was
all
so
far
as
grace
harlowe
and
her
friends
had
planned
it
what
the
developed
into
was
an
exciting
adventure
which
had
in
it
all
the
elements
of
a
real
tragedy
grace
already
was
glorying
in
the
fresh
air
the
roll
of
the
vehicle
under
her
and
the
uncertainty
of
what
the
next
moment
held
for
her
our
wagon
stand
a
lively
run
down
the
grade
she
questioned
as
they
topped
a
rise
and
she
saw
a
stretch
of
about
half
a
mile
of
trail
falling
away
and
disappearing
in
the
valley
below
them
reckon
it
will
grinned
the
driver
about
the
horses
all
right
you
worry
the
nags
shake
them
out
stir
up
those
people
in
the
coach
and
show
them
what
riding
in
a
deadwood
stagecoach
really
means
eagerly
urged
grace
harlowe
ike
did
he
gave
the
reins
a
shake
and
cracked
the
whip
that
sounded
to
grace
like
the
report
of
a
pistol
the
horses
responded
instantly
starting
down
the
steep
grade
at
a
lively
gallop
accompanied
by
encouraging
yelps
from
ike
fairweather
the
way
we
driv
when
we
thought
the
redskins
was
after
us
he
called
to
grace
without
turning
his
head
twenty
seconds
later
the
coach
was
rolling
like
a
ship
in
a
heavy
sea
accompanied
by
a
medley
of
shrieks
and
shouts
of
protest
from
the
jumbled
cargo
of
passengers
inside
faster
fairweather
urged
grace
yelps
grew
louder
and
closer
together
and
the
gallop
of
the
team
became
a
run
about
this
time
the
occupants
on
the
inside
of
the
coach
having
reached
the
limit
of
their
endurance
registered
a
violent
protest
chapter
iii
a
thrilling
halt
up
there
cut
the
gun
bellowed
the
voice
of
hippy
wingate
using
an
term
for
shutting
off
the
power
it
i
say
you
will
have
us
all
in
the
ditch
grace
grinned
at
ike
and
ike
grinned
at
his
team
neither
made
any
reply
to
wail
of
distress
hat
was
now
off
her
hair
was
blowing
in
the
wind
and
her
eyes
were
snapping
that
glorious
fairweather
she
cried
as
the
stagecoach
reached
the
bottom
of
the
grade
and
lurched
around
a
sharp
curve
on
two
wheels
a
proceeding
that
brought
another
series
of
shrieks
from
the
occupants
of
the
coach
hippy
was
still
protesting
and
threatening
then
suddenly
grace
and
ike
were
startled
at
hearing
the
voice
close
behind
them
right
at
their
ears
it
seemed
grace
turned
and
found
herself
looking
into
the
flushed
face
of
hippy
wingate
whose
head
and
shoulders
were
above
the
top
of
the
coach
he
was
standing
on
the
window
sill
of
the
door
and
clinging
to
the
edge
of
the
roof
of
the
stagecoach
down
hippy
you
will
be
thrown
off
and
hurt
begged
grace
be
any
worse
injured
than
i
am
now
after
being
played
football
with
inside
of
this
old
box
the
matter
there
a
brake
on
this
bundle
of
junk
know
sorry
but
i
thought
you
might
enjoy
a
few
sideslips
to
remind
you
of
france
please
stop
fairweather
he
will
break
his
neck
if
he
tries
to
get
down
while
we
are
in
ike
applied
the
brake
and
pulled
up
the
horses
whereupon
hippy
sprang
down
to
the
trail
and
swung
aboard
again
you
do
that
again
walk
was
his
parting
threat
you
like
it
miss
grinned
the
driver
i
have
not
had
such
an
exciting
ride
since
one
time
when
i
was
racing
with
my
ambulance
in
france
to
clear
a
ahead
of
a
shell
that
was
on
the
way

must
have
seen

big
ones

three
say
ike
gazed
at
her
with
new
interest
he
in
the
war

referring
to
hippy
as
an
aviator
and
fought
many
battles
in
the
air
all
the
young
women
who
are
with
us
on
this
drive

a
part
of
the
overton
college
unit
that
went
overseas
for
the
red

service

now
in
russia
where
he
was
sent
after

school
girl

this
bet
i
should
like
to
have
him

answered
grace
smilingly
you
think
we
shall
be
able
to
stir
up
any
excitement
on
the
trail
we
propose
to
do
the
entire
journey
on
our
ponies
you
know
starting
the
day
after
mebby
reflected
ike
there
any
apaches
left
in
the
mountains
questioned
grace
too
many
of
when
they
want
to
beg
or
steal
from
you
trust
miss
an
an
indian
when
an
apache
do
a
heap
lot
more
than
they
do
if
they
dared
can
you
shoot
admitted
grace
bet
a
dead
shot
if
them
eyes
was
behind
a
gun
thet
was
pinted
at
me
put
up
my
hands
without
asked
a
second
you
ever
held
up
by
bandits
asked
grace
eager
to
get
the
old
stagecoach
driver
started
talking
of
his
experiences
thing
in
the
old
did
you
do
in
those
emergencies
put
up
my
paws
when
i
was
invited
to
such
fellows
can
shoot
and
most
always
fairweather
did
your
passengers
never
venture
to
defend
themselves
a
man
did
down
there
now
near
where
to
stop
for
chuck
in
squaw
was
not
quick
enough
is
that
it
sir
said
it
was
the
germans
quick
on
the
trigger
sharpshooters
were
very
quick
good
shots
too
all
of
them
but
our
sharpshooters
could
beat
them
at
stalking
you
know
our
boys
like
to
fight
indian
style
while
the
german
fights
by
rule
and
the
driver
nodded
his
understanding
and
began
admonishing
the
horse
who
was
using
his
heels
rather
too
freely
critter
would
run
away
if
i
give
him
half
a
show
grinned
ike
course
if
he
were
to
do
that
and
turn
the
coach
over
you
could
not
help
yourself
could
you
fairweather
questioned
grace
innocently
ike
gave
her
a
quick
sidelong
glance
but
grace
face
was
guileless
like
to
have
him
run
away
he
chuckled
no
nothing
like
that
sir
my
friends
might
get
hurt
otherwise
i
should
not
mind
it
at
shore
are
a
queer
one
muttered
ike
beyond
the
rise
you
see
ahead
is
squaw
valley
good
water
there
and
fine
place
to
have
chuck
how
much
further
do
you
reckon
on
was
about
to
suggest
that
you
decide
that
if
we
ride
until
ten
it
will
be
late
enough
i
imagine
too
that
our
friends
in
the
coach
will
have
had
enough
of
it
by
then
after
leaving
the
valley
if
we
decide
to
go
further
i
will
go
inside
giving
lieutenant
wingate
an
opportunity
to
ride
outside
with
you
perhaps
you
may
be
able
to
induce
him
to
tell
you
how
he
fought
the
huns
above
the
clouds
i
know
you
will
enjoy
hearing
of
it
from
a
man
who
has
fought
that
i
would
never
was
a
prisoner
over
there
was
you
asked
ike
the
boches

me
once
and
sent
me
to
a
prison
camp
but
i
made
my
escape
they
came
near
getting
me

after

a
family

was
determined
to
get
all
the
information
he
could
he
had
been
doing
it
for
years
from
the
passengers
who
rode
with
him
on
top
of
the
stage
you
mean
children
i
have
a
daughter
an
adopted
french
girl
i
found
her
in
a
deserted
french
village
one
night
the
village
at
the
time
being
under
heavy
artillery
fire
i
adopted
the
little
one
later
and
she
is
now
at
school
back
east
that
squaw
valley
asked
grace
pointing
a
few
moments
later
the
stagecoach
drew
out
to
one
side
of
the
trail
and
stopped
out
for
mess
cried
grace
springing
to
the
ground
do
you
folks
feel
after
that
delightful
ride
did
you
call
it
demanded
hippy
wingate
getting
out
laboriously
and
limping
about
to
take
the
kinks
out
of
his
legs
worse
than
hitting
one
of
those
bumpy
white
clouds
with
an
harlowe
i
believe
you
gave
us
that
shaking
up
on
purpose
accused
elfreda
briggs
the
others
voiced
their
protests
in
no
uncertain
manner
will
forget
all
about
it
after
we
have
made
tea
and
cooked
our
bacon
comforted
grace
neither
admitting
nor
denying
the
accusation
is
nothing
like
a
good
shaking
up
to
accelerate
under
grace
skillful
hands
a
little
fire
was
soon
flickering
beside
the
trail
the
driver
eyeing
the
blaze
with
approval
then
the
overton
girls
got
briskly
to
work
preparing
the
supper
you
learn
to
make
an
indian
demanded
ike
husband
taught
me
he
is
a
forester
you
know
replied
grace
how
to
make
a
yes
do
no
tenderfoot
you
reckon
fetch
water
for
the
folks
and
horses
the
party
ate
sitting
on
the
ground
interest
during
the
meal
being
divided
between
grace
harlowe
and
lieutenant
wingate
they
were
the
first
real
heroes
that
he
had
ever
known
and
he
proposed
to
make
the
most
of
his
opportunity
fairweather
shall
we
go
on
asked
grace
after
they
had
finished
the
meal
so
better
camping
ground
further
equipment
was
quickly
packed
away
and
ike
hooked
up
for
the
start
but
before
leaving
hippy
wingate
and
elfreda
issued
a
solemn
warning
that
there
was
to
be
no
more
speeding
the
night
now
upon
them
was
moonless
but
the
stars
shed
a
faint
light
on
the
trail
causing
it
to
stand
out
dimly
for
a
short
distance
ahead
of
them
save
here
and
there
where
overhanging
rocks
threw
it
into
a
deep
shadow
it
was
an
ideal
night
for
traveling
cool
but
invigorating
with
the
breath
of
mountain
and
canyon
heavy
on
the
still
evening
air
lieutenant
wingate
was
riding
with
the
driver
grace
now
being
inside
the
coach
with
the
other
girls
to
protect
themselves
from
the
chill
mountain
air
elfreda
anne
emma
and
nora
had
wrapped
themselves
in
blankets
and
were
dozing
off
to
sleep
grace
was
not
sleepy
though
the
slow
movement
of
the
stagecoach
as
the
horses
climbed
the
steep
grade
was
monotonous
she
was
too
keenly
alive
to
the
wonders
of
the
mountains
to
think
of
sleep
anyway
grace
leaned
well
out
with
head
down
watching
the
white
trail
that
had
echoed
to
the
scuff
of
the
moccasin
of
the
savage
redmen
so
many
times
in
the
past
and
that
was
slipping
slowly
from
under
her
now
and
then
gazing
ahead
along
the
narrow
way
with
wondering
eyes
the
distant
conversation
of
lieutenant
wingate
and
ike
fairweather
drifted
down
in
undistinguishable
murmurs
is
filling
ike
with
war
stories
and
he
is
drawing
the
long
bow
too
venture
to
say
that
grace
drew
a
sharp
breath
and
her
heart
gave
a
thump
the
overton
girl
thought
she
had
seen
a
figure
dart
to
the
side
of
the
road
and
into
the
shadow
of
the
rocks
as
the
coach
swung
around
a
sharp
bend
on
the
mountain
trail
there
is
another
something
is
going
on
here
grace
opened
the
coach
door
on
the
opposite
side
there
was
a
long
sloping
bank
on
that
side
the
right
side
leading
down
she
did
not
know
how
far
for
the
bottom
was
in
deep
shadow
there
are
indians
on
the
trail
muttered
grace
slipping
out
to
the
trail
and
closing
the
coach
door
behind
her
as
she
trotted
along
beside
the
slowly
moving
stagecoach
she
then
hopped
to
the
step
where
she
crouched
clinging
to
the
door
frame
with
one
hand
grace
could
still
hear
hippy
and
ike
fairweather
speaking
and
so
interested
were
they
in
their
conversation
that
they
failed
to
see
what
grace
keen
eyes
had
discovered
all
what
i
saw
may
be
simply
prowlers
reflected
grace
though
her
intuition
told
her
that
the
figures
she
had
discovered
on
the
trail
ahead
meant
something
more
than
mere
prowling
grace
intuition
in
this
instance
was
not
at
fault
two
rifle
reports
close
at
hand
broke
the
mountain
stillness
and
the
coach
stopped
with
a
sudden
jolt
as
ike
fairweather
brought
his
horses
to
their
haunches
so
quickly
did
he
pull
them
up
a
cry
which
grace
recognized
as
having
been
uttered
by
emma
dean
was
heard
in
the
coach
down
on
the
floor
every
one
of
you
and
not
another
sound
commanded
grace
in
a
low
voice
dropping
on
all
fours
to
the
trail
and
in
that
position
crawling
under
the
coach
on
hands
and
feet
before
ducking
under
a
quick
upward
glance
had
shown
grace
that
lieutenant
hands
were
thrust
above
his
head
and
that
ike
fairweather
was
holding
his
as
high
as
possible
out
and
keep
your
hands
above
your
heads
commanded
a
stern
voice
on
the
mountain
side
of
the
coach
grace
harlowe
unlimbered
her
little
automatic
revolver
from
its
holster
under
her
blouse
the
weapon
that
she
had
carried
through
the
war
four
frightened
girls
crouching
on
the
floor
of
the
deadwood
coach
had
not
uttered
a
sound
since
the
command
to
step
out
was
uttered
nor
had
they
made
a
movement
to
obey
that
command
out
of
that
on
the
jump
ordered
the
same
stern
voice
that
grace
had
first
heard
but
this
time
in
a
new
and
more
menacing
tone
a
pair
of
booted
legs
appeared
before
grace
at
the
side
of
the
coach
and
she
heard
the
coach
door
jerked
open
followed
by
a
scream
from
emma
without
an
hesitation
grace
thrust
her
revolver
forward
until
its
muzzle
was
close
to
one
of
the
booted
legs
and
pulled
the
trigger
chapter
iv
the
battle
with
the
bandits
the
highwayman
uttered
a
yell
and
leaped
clear
of
the
ground
dropping
his
rifle
which
clattered
to
the
trail
within
easy
reach
of
the
overton
hand
two
rifle
bullets
ripped
through
the
roof
of
the
old
stagecoach
cowards
fumed
grace
under
her
breath
snatching
up
the
rifle
that
the
highwayman
had
dropped
she
crawled
out
from
under
the
coach
and
ran
around
behind
it
just
as
two
more
bandit
shots
rang
out
grace
threw
the
rifle
to
her
shoulder
and
fired
at
a
shadowy
figure
that
she
could
barely
see
and
in
the
next
second
lieutenant
heavy
army
revolver
cracked
spitefully
from
the
front
seat
of
the
coach
with
grace
first
shot
hippy
had
unlimbered
and
his
revolver
was
now
banging
away
to
good
purpose
as
grace
realized
when
she
heard
another
yell
of
pain
out
grace
coming
warned
hippy
as
he
leaped
from
the
top
of
the
coach
to
the
trail
this
fellow
please
he
is
wounded
only
in
the
leg
and
dangerous
i
will
take
care
of
the
others
while
you
are
doing
that
said
grace
starting
to
creep
forward
with
rifle
ready
to
fire
a
revolver
flashed
from
behind
a
jutting
shelf
of
rock
the
rifle
in
grace
hands
answered
the
revolver
shot
she
heard
her
bullet
smack
against
the
shale
rock
and
pieces
of
stone
patter
on
the
trail
grunted
the
bandit
who
had
fired
at
her
grace
was
certain
that
she
had
not
hit
the
man
but
she
believed
that
a
splinter
of
rock
had
accomplished
what
her
bullet
had
missed
doing
while
all
of
this
was
going
on
hippy
was
removing
the
weapons
from
the
bandit
through
whose
leg
grace
had
fired
a
bullet
from
her
automatic
revolver
the
overton
girl
was
still
cautiously
creeping
forward
any
of
you
highwaymen
fires
another
shot
it
will
be
your
last
she
warned
out
gray
i
reckon
another
of
them
critters
behind
thet
pint
of
rock
drawled
the
calm
voice
of
ike
fairweather
who
sat
holding
his
horses
observing
the
fight
with
fascinated
eyes
ike
eager
as
he
was
to
get
into
the
fight
dared
not
leave
his
team
knowing
that
if
he
did
so
they
would
promptly
run
away
with
the
coach
and
outfit
have
my
eye
on
him
fairweather
replied
grace
in
a
voice
that
was
without
a
trace
of
excitement
heard
what
i
said
fellow
she
added
addressing
the
bandit
lurking
behind
the
rock
your
weapons
into
the
road
toss
them
out
again
grace
harlowe
had
fired
at
the
same
rock
and
again
she
heard
a
scattering
rain
of
shale
that
her
bullet
dislodged
the
highwayman
hiding
there
threw
his
rifle
away
she
heard
it
fall
on
the
trail
but
was
certain
that
the
man
still
possessed
at
least
one
revolver
and
perhaps
two
illustration
this
rest
of
them
you
have
two
more
weapons
out
with
them
quick
two
revolvers
followed
the
rifle
and
fell
on
the
trail
just
as
she
was
about
to
emphasize
her
command
with
another
shot
as
a
reminder
that
she
meant
what
she
said
with
rifle
at
ready
grace
now
sprang
boldly
to
the
ledge
of
rock
where
she
saw
a
man
standing
leaning
against
a
tree
a
hand
pressed
to
his
forehead
a
few
yards
further
on
were
two
others
one
lying
beside
the
trail

other
sitting
with
his
back
against
a
rock

lieutenant

at
a
brisk
trot
by
now
the
rest
of
the
overton
girls
having
found
their
courage
had
crept
from
the
stagecoach
and
were
hiding
behind
it
peering
out
through
troubled
eyes
elfreda
finally
stepped
out
and
walked
slowly
toward
the
scene
of
activity
but
halted
a
little
distance
from

not
wishing
to
detract
attention
from
her
work

the
fellow
sitting
here
and
remove
his

of

and
to

admonished

not
giving
him
brotherly
advice
for
the
good
of
his
physiognomy
how
is
the
bird
there
by
the
coach

she
uttered
a
peal
of
laughter
that

too
bad
she
cried
suddenly
changing
her
tone

it
demanded
hippy
worth
worrying
about
the
old
stagecoach
got
away
from
fairweather
while
he
was
turning
it
and
it
went
over
the
edge
of
the

into
the

the
scene
of
the
disaster
but
feelings

considerably
ruffled
replied
miss
briggs
ike
after
having
been
dragged
to
the
very
edge
of
the
trail
by
the
coach
had
picked
himself
up
and
was
brushing
the
dirt
from
his
clothes
for
he
had
been
dragged
right
across
the
trail
but
let
go
just
in
time
to
save
himself

in
the
world
has
happened
begged
grace
solicitously

sympathetically
did
it
occur
blamed
thing
got
away
from
me
while
i
was
it
around
by
hand
all
ought
to
have
known
to
tackle
it
long
will
it
take
to
get
the
coach
back
on
the
trail
so
that
we
may
go

questioned
emma

innocently
it
on

grace
confidently

onto
thirty
mile
i
thirty
miles
cried
emma
should
simply
reckon
have
to
walk
if
you
want
to
get
back
grumbled
ike
is
most
excellent
exercise
and
i
am
certain
that
it
will
do
all
of
us
good
i
have
a
plan
fairweather
spoke
up
grace
you
would
at
this
juncture
lieutenant
wingate
came
up
leading
the
two
wounded
men
who
had
been
left
down
the
trail
he
too
wished
to
know
what
the
plan
was
for
getting
back
to
town
was
about
to
suggest
something
to
fairweather
replied
grace
shall
have
to
use
the
coach
horses
to
help
carry
not
forget
our
prisoners
in
your
calculations
reminded
hippy
wingate
you
do
not
propose
to
let
them
go
have
not
forgotten
no
sir
we
are
not
going
to
release
them
after
all
the
bother
they
have
put
us
to
let
me
see
there
are
four
prisoners
and
five
two
men
interjected
hippy
placing
two
bandits
on
a
horse
that
will
leave
two
horses
to
carry
the
rest
of
us
the
girls
can
ride
two
on
a
horse
which
will
take
care
of
nora
anne
elfreda
and
emma
you
two
men
and
myself
will
walk
should
we
walkers
get
foot
weary
we
can
change
places
with
the
girls
who
are
riding
does
that
meet
with
your
approval
fairweather
shore
hippy
suggested
instead
that
he
be
permitted
to
ride
back
to
town
for
assistance
but
grace
objected
to
this
prisoners
need
medical
attention
and
we
shall
have
to
go
on
short
rations
as
it
is
so
we
have
no
time
to
lose
we
will
tie
the
four
men
on
two
horses
and
tie
the
pair
of
horses
together
fairweather
can
lead
the
animals
you
hippy
will
walk
alongside
of
them
and
i
will
bring
up
the
if
one
of
the
bandits
drops
off
and
gives
us
the
slip
questioned
hippy
shall
see
to
it
that
he
get
far
answered
grace
significantly
grunted
ike
thought
the
lieutenant
was
me
a
fairy
story
your
in
the
war
from
what
seen
i
reckon
he
told
the
half
of
what
there
is
to
tell
why
lady
if
you
was
to
live
out
here
be
sheriff
of
the
county
at
the
next
election
i
reckon
i
know
of
one
vote
you
then
you
approve
of
my
plan
asked
grace
the
ground
you
folks
she
questioned
turning
to
her
companions
all
nodded
their
heads
in
approval
wish
i
had
an
airplane
grumbled
hippy
wingate
never
did
like
to
walk
when
i
had
will
take
the
rifles
and
revolvers
of
the
highwaymen
with
us
i
do
not
believe
they
will
have
use
for
their
weapons
we
may
need
them
ourselves
fairweather
if
you
will
get
the
horses
ready
we
will
load
up
and
ike
removed
his
sombrero
and
wiped
his
forehead
on
his
sleeve
get
ready
but
what
ike
fairweather
wants
to
say
he
somehow
it
sticks
in
his
crop
come
out
the
real
thing
all
of
you
is
any
galoot
that
says
you
well
ike
fairweather
will
take
care
of
thet
fellows
i
have
a
word
for

grace
turning
to
the
prisoners
warn
you
that
if
you
try
to
get

i
shall
altogether
in

thet
the
daylights

be
blown
out
of
the
critter
thet
tries
to
get
away
reminded
ike
fair
not
fairweather
chuckled
hippy
wingate
which
brought
a
groan
of
disapproval
from
the
overton
girls
placing
the
prisoners
on
the
horses
and
tying
them
securely
was
a
proceeding
that
took
some
little
time
so
that
it
was
fully
an
hour
later
before
the
procession
started
out
elfreda
anne
emma
and
nora
riding
on
the
two
leading
horses

of

procession
and
grace
harlowe
with
a
rifle
slung
in
the
crook
of
her
right
arm
bringing
up
the
rear
the
highwaymen
were
sullen
not
uttering
a
word
so
far
as
grace
had
heard
though
she
had
no
doubt
that
they
had
quietly
exchanged
confidences
the
one
who
was
most
severely
wounded
was
the
man
whose
scalp
a
bullet
had
raked
but
he
apparently
was
in
no
danger
though
still
weak
from
loss
of
blood
there
a
place
where
we
can
get
breakfast
if
still

the
morning

they
plodded
on
grace
if
anything
being
the
most
cheerful
and
contented
member
of
the
party
at
break
of
day
they
halted
having
made
about
ten
miles
of
the
thirty
from
the
little
kit
pack
in
which
each
one
carried
emergency
rations
they
eked
out
a
slender
breakfast
though
they
had
neither
coffee
nor
tea
that
part
of
the
food
supply
being
at
the
bottom
of
the
canyon
in
the
wreckage
of
the
old
deadwood
coach
the
prisoners
however
refused
to
eat
maintaining
a
sullen
silence
as
they
watched
their
captors
partaking
of
breakfast
at
the
noon
halt
grace
and
elfreda
dressed
the
wounds
binding
them
up
with
skillful
hands
with
pieces
of
cloth
torn
from
skirts
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
either
grace
harlowe
or
elfreda
briggs
had
dressed
bullet
wounds
both
having
been
called
upon
to
do
so
in
numerous
instances
on
the
western
front
in
france
the
prisoners
watched
the
dressing
operations
without
uttering
a
word
of
comment
but
the
expressions
on
their
faces
were
not
pleasant
to
look
upon
ike
who
had
been
regarding

interest

as
the
girls
finished
their
work
and
walked
away

his
fingers
through
his
whiskers
the
prisoners
were
placed
on
the
horses
and
secured
after
which
the
party
started
on
again

ike
a
few
moments
later

up
a

for

to

three
horsemen
swept
around
a
bend
in

the

hove
in

uttered
a
shout
deputy

the
deputy
upon
recognizing

swung
down
from
his
horse
doffed
his
hat
to
grace
and
turned
to
fairweather
do
you
reckon
got
here
demanded
the
deputy
ike
explained
who
and
what
his
outfit
was
relating
briefly
the
story
of
the
loss
of
the
stagecoach
and
the
capture
of
the

the
business
deputy
sheriff

introduced
ike
you

the
prisoners
sir
she
asked
after
looking
the
bandits
over
closely
the
deputy
shook
his
head
he
asked
ike
if
he
needed
any
assistance
to
get
the
prisoners
in
grace
answered
the
question
by
saying
that
they
did
not
going
out
after
a
fellow
who
lives
in
the
mountains
and
who
has
been
shooting
game
out
of
season
but
tell
you
what
do
send
one
of
my
men
to
globe
in
a
hurry
and
have
him
ride
out
to
the
ranch
and
get
him
offered
the
deputy
will
save
you
waiting
for
the
sheriff
when
you
get
in
i
reckon
maybe
these
are
fellows
that
sheriff
collins
has
been
looking
for
take
your
men
right
to
the
jail
ike
and
collins
will
do
the
after
starting
one
of
his
men
back
toward
globe
wheelock
mounted
waved
a
hand
and
with
his
assistant
galloped
on
the
overton
party
assumed
its
former
formation
and
plodded
on
weary
but
encouraged
by
the
realization
that
only
a
few
hours
now
separated
them
from
their
goal
it
was
half
past
three
in
the
afternoon
when
the
weary
overton
party
reached
the
arizona
town
from
which
it
had
made
its
start
the
day
before
the
four
girls
on
two
horses
decided
that
they
would
dismount
before
entering
the
town
even
emma
dean
declaring
that
this
was
one
time
when
she
was
not
seeking
publicity
the
news
of
the
plucky
fight
that
grace
and
hippy
had
made
and
their
capture
of
four
highwaymen
had
been
carried
to
town
by
the
assistant
and
throngs
stood
on
the
main
street
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
party
occasionally
there
was
a
cheer
from
a
group
of
enthusiasts
but
generally
the
townspeople
were
silent
curiosity
being
their
leading
emotion
i
think
it
might
be
advisable
for
you
to
go
on
to
the
hotel

all
fagged
out

grace
along
and
i
will
be
over

for

the
sheriff
came
out
to
meet
them
as
they
rounded
up
their
horses
before
the
jail
entrance
he
strode
straight
to
the
bandit

grace
while

under

in
the

testimony

be
necessary
for

trial

bandits

she
was
relieved

be
the
witness
who
would
appear
against
the
prisoners

complimented
by
the
judge
for
her
part
in
capturing
con
bates
and
his
fellow
highwaymen
sheriff
collins
accompanied
her
from
the
court
room
have
an
eye
on
you
while
your
party
is
in
this
neck
of
the
woods
he
volunteered
shall
i
do
with
the
rifles
i
promised
you
not
too
much
trouble
please
send
them
to
stable
before
two
this
afternoon
he
is
to
drive
our
wagon
for
us
and
will
pack
the
rifles
with
the
other
equipment
is
there
ammunition
for
the
rifles
or
shall
i
purchase
some
fifty
rounds
for
each
rifle
and
miss
my
hunch
that
you
will
do
well
not
to
pack
the
rifles
away
so
deep
that
you
reach
them
in
a
hurry
advised
collins
after
thanking
the
sheriff
for
his
courtesy
grace
hurried
back
to
the
hotel
the
rest
of
the
day
was
devoted
to
preparations
for
the
journey
ike
fairweather
now
fully
informed
as
to
the
immediate
plans
of
his
party
got
away
with
the
wagon
on
time
and
two
hours
later
the
overton
girls
started
on
their
second
journey
into
the
gorgeous
mountains
that
stand
sentinel
along
the
old
apache
trail
the
ponies
they
were
riding
were
a
bit
lively
at
the
start
especially
the
one
ridden
by
grace
as
the
party
galloped
out
of
the
town
emma
dean
was
making
heavy
weather
of
it
bobbing
up
and
down
like
a
chip
on
the
sea
until
grace
fearful
that
emma
would
fall
off
rode
up
beside
her
for
a
word
of
caution
your
saddle
firmly
and
do
not
try
to
resist
the
motion
of
your
horse
move
with
him
or
rather
permit
your
body
to
follow
his
movements
advised
grace
you
see
you
know
but
it
bumps
me
almost
to
death
how
far
do
we
have
to
ride
this
beast
a
bit
like
my
miles
or
h
h
wailed
emma
at
hippy
they
had
barely
cleared
the
town
and
emerged
into
the
open
country
when
hippy
apparently
docile
pony
suddenly
came
to
life
the
animal
whirled
and
started
back
toward
globe
whereupon
hippy
used
his
crop
vigorously
instantly
the
pony
began
to
buck
in
the
most
approved
western
broncho
style
and
hippy
was
more
often
in
the
air
than
on
the
saddle
the
overton
girls
reined
in
and
watched
the
battle
offering
suggestions
and
advice
that
might
have
been
helpful
had
the
lieutenant
had
time
to
listen
hippy
had
had
no
experience
with
bucking
ponies
and
as
a
result
he
was
becoming
more
and
more
confused
from
the
terrible
jolting
he
was
getting
on
hippy
my
darling
encouraged
nora
in
a
shrill
voice
he
goes
gasped
elfreda
briggs
hippy
made
a
long
ungraceful
dive
over
the
lowered
head
of
the
native
pony
at
the
side
of
the
road
there
was
a
ditch
with
a
full
twelve
inches
of
water
flowing
over
a
bottom
of
soft
mud
lieutenant
wingate
landed
on
head
and
shoulders
in
the
ditch
his
feet
pawed
the
air
for
a
few
seconds
then
hippy
flopped
over
with
face
down
in
the
water
and
mud
it
was
elfreda
briggs
who
checked
pony
at
the
psychological
moment
for
the
little
fellow
already
had
whirled
preparatory
to
racing
for
home
as
it
was
he
dragged
elfreda
along
with
him
until
grace
sprang
to
her
assistance
and
threw
her
weight
on
the
bit
at
the
same
time
talking
soothingly
to
the
animal
whose
stubborn
resentment
slowly
melted
elfreda
led
him
back
without
help
and
stood
holding
the
pony
waiting
for
hippy
to
take
charge
of
him
lieutenant
wingate
was
plastered
with
mud
which
nora
was
solicitously
mopping
from
his
face
with
her
handkerchief
it
dry
on
then
roll
him
on
the
grass
when
we
find
some
suggested
emma
who
coddled
you
when
you
fell
out
of
a
cloud
and
crashed
down
on
the
french
front
laughed
grace
fall
out
protested
hippy
indignantly
though
a
little
thickly
for
there
was
still
mud
in
his
mouth
was
the
other
fellow
who
fell
and
take
your
pony
urged
elfreda
have
my
own
to
look
after
i
would
suggest
too
that
if
you
will
treat
him
right
you
will
have
little
trouble
with
have
to
take
the
part
i
reckon
i
know
how
to
handle
a
you
have
a
horse
that
knows
how
to
handle
you
if
my
observation
is
not
at
fault
interjected
grace
harlowe
hippy
acted
upon
advice
however
petted
the
pony
and
offered
it
some
candy
which
the
animal
refused
and
finally
swung
himself
into
the
saddle
the
party
then
moved
off
at
a
brisk
gallop
the
sun
was
behind
the
mountains
when
they
reached
squaw
valley
for
the
second
time
down
on
the
level
below
the
trail
they
saw
their
tents
pitched
and
ready
for
them
the
wagon
team
was
staked
down
a
fire
was
burning
in
front
of
the
tents
and
ike
fairweather
was
observed
working
about
the
camp
the
girls
shouted
and
ike
waved
a
hand
without
leaving
their
saddles
the
entire
party
slid
their
ponies
down
the
steep
bank
without
a
single
rider
coming
a
cropper
though
emma
lost
her
stirrups
and
was
clinging
to
the
pommel
of
her
saddle
bouncing
up
and
down
perilously
as
the
party
trotted
into
camp
when
her
pony
stopped
which
it
did
abruptly
emma
fell
off
in
a
heap
about
the
same
instant
lieutenant
pony
stepped
in
a
hole
and
hippy
went
off
over
the
head
but
this
time
he
clung
to
the
bridle
rein
and
held
the
animal
work
complimented
grace
when
hippy
very
red
of
face
struggled
to
his
feet

are
a
graceful
animal
lieutenant

a
little
way
beyond

i
suppose

be
falling
into
that
right
abuse

the
lieutenant

with

thrown
over

arm
walked
over

ike
fairweather
that
lieutenant
wingate
has
finished
his
performance
i
wish
to
say
that
it
is
very
fine
of
you
to
get
our
supper
the
bacon
was
in
the
frying
pan
and
the
potatoes
baked
in
hot
ashes
were
ready
to
be
served
as
grace
discovered
upon
testing
them
with
a
fork
the
coffee
was
done
and
the
tin
plates
were
already
on
the
folding
table
that
had
been
included
with
the
equipment
oilcloth
spread
over
the
table
made
it
look
quite
attractive
folding
camp
stools
had
been
placed
by
ike
and
hippy
promptly
took
a
seat
at
the
head
of
the
table
the
only
male
member
of
this
party
proper
my
place
is
at
the

declared

on
the
food
and

and
be

urged
grace
laughingly
as
she
began
serving
the
food
my
childhood
days
i
was
taught
that
children
while
at
table
should
be
seen
and
not
heard

to
eat
at
fashionable
darkness

enveloped
mountain
and
canyon
by
the
time
the
evening
meal
was
finished
it
was
the
deep
mysterious
darkness
of
the
mountains
the
girls
could
hear
the
faint
musical
murmur
of
pinal
creek
a
few
hundred
yards
below
them
music
that
accentuated
the
romance
of
the
mysterious
mountain
night
hippy
wingate
finally
having
eaten
all
he
could
conveniently
stow
away
stood
up
and
rapped
on
a
tin
plate
for
order
and
gentlemen
he
began
raising
the
plate
above
his
head
where
it
reflected
the
light
from
the
campfire
are
now
in
the
former
haunts
of
the
murderous
apaches
we
have
fallen
willing
victims

mischievously

when
your

i
believe
reminded
elfreda
dryly
we
have
penetrated
far
into
the
labyrinth
of
the
red
men
of
other
days
the
place
where
the
savages
crept
with
stealthy
tread
until
their
primitive
language
came
to
know
it
as
the
apache
trail
along
this
weird
and
amazing
pathway
the
tin
plate
was
whisked
from
hand
and
fell
clattering
to
the
ground
came
the
belated
report
of
a
rifle
emma
dean
uttered
a
stifled
little
cry
of
alarm
is
nothing
but
a
bullet
my
dear
young
woman
a
chance
shot
from
somewhere
up
in
the
mountains
kindly
pass
me
another
plate
that
i
may
continue
with
my
grace
face
reflected
sudden
concern
then
she
smiled
but
her
companions
plainly
were
nervous
was
i
again
asked
hippy
believe
you
were
laboring
along
on
the
amazing
pathway
anne
informed
him
you
bowed
the
lieutenant
as
grace
offered
him
another
plate
this
weird
and
amazing
pathway
as
already
remarked
are
crowded
in
bewildering
succession
scenes
that
grip
the
imagination
like
phantom
photo
plays
of
the
creation
it
was
on
this
pathway
this
weird
and
amazing
trail
that
the
second
plate
left
hippy
hand
as
if
by
magic
again
followed
by
the
report
of
a
rifle
hippy
sank
down
on
his
campstool
holding
the
hand
that
had
held
the
plate
campfire
fairweather
urged
grace
calmly
with
a
note
of
incisiveness
in
her
tone
ike
sprang
up
and
kicked
the
burning
embers
away
stamping
out
the
little
flickering
flames
leaving
only
a
scattered
bed
of
glowing
coals
a
bullet
whistled
over
the
heads
of
the
overton
girls
but
the
aim
was
not
so
good

chapter
vii
a
lively
night
in
camp
you
hit
lieutenant
questioned
grace
stepping
over
to
hippy
on
my
right
thumb
get
excited
nora
begged
hippy
as
his
wife
ran
to
him
bullet
merely
broke
the
is
what
comes
of
your
nonsense
hippy
wingate
rebuked
nora
was
the
shiny
tin
plate
that
did
grace
nodded
i
pour
water
on
the
coals
asked
ike
his
voice
trembling
with
anger
now
fairweather
we
will
first
see
what
develops
replied
grace
do
you
reckon
on
this
miss
persisted
the
driver
must
protect
ourselves
of
course
but
just
how
we
shall
have
to
consider
carefully
is
the
creek
fordable
along
here
reckon
so
no
difficulty
anyone
over
thet
wants
to
why
miss
was
wondering
if
the
man
who
shot
at
us
could
easily
cross
to
this
side
of
the
stream
murmured
grace
reflectively
we
shall
have
to
take
turns
at
guarding
the
camp
i
will
watch
it
until
midnight
lieutenant
wingate
will
relieve
me
then
and
remain
on
watch
until
four
in
the
morning
which
is
the
hour
you
turn
out
fairweather
suggested
grace
ike
insisted
that
he
could
keep
watch
all
night
but
grace
shook
her
head
declaring
that
such
an
arrangement
would
not
be
fair
to
him
really
believe
fairweather
that
you
would
be
willing
to
go
without
sleep
during
the
entire
journey
just
for
the
sake
of
getting
sight
of
the
man
who
shot
at
us
averred
grace
would
thet
rumbled
ike
let
the
incident
worry
you
we
girls
have
been
under
fire
too
often
to
be
greatly
disturbed
by
a
few
rifle
shots
of
course
it
comfortable
to
be
shot
at
by
a
man
who
knows
how
to
use
a
rifle
as
well
as
that
fellow
apparently
does
but
so
long
as
he
hit
one
of
us
why
worry
laughed
grace
ike
stroked
his
whiskers
and
shook
his
head
at
this
juncture
elfreda
who
had
taken
upon
herself
the
task
of
dressing
lieutenant
wound
announced
that
it
was
completed
mighty
glad
it
was
the
thumb
instead
of
the
trigger
finger
said
hippy
may
have
use
for
that
trigger
finger
before
reaching
the
other
end
of
the
apache
and
the
opportunity
may
come
added
grace
she
then
told
him
of
her
plan
for
guarding
the
camp
rather
expecting
that
the
lieutenant
would
protest
against
being
called
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
do
guard
duty
on
the
contrary
hippy
eagerly
seconded
the
suggestion
and
promptly
got
out
his
rifle
which
he
began
to
clean
and
oil
ready
bring
on
your
bad
men
he
cried
dramatically
an
hour
later
the
camp
was
in
silence
all
save
grace
being
asleep
in
their
tents
her
watch
passed
without
incident
at
midnight
she
made
a
tour
of
the
camp
and
its
immediate
vicinity
and
finding
the
ponies
quiet
returned
to
camp
and
awakened
lieutenant
wingate
the
wagon
team
being
staked
down
close
to
the
camp
just
to
the
rear
of
the
little
in
which
the
driver
slept
needed
no
watching
for
ike
could
hear
their
every
move
of
a
disturbing
nature
has
occurred
grace
informed
lieutenant
wingate
who
came
out
with
rifle
in
hand
yawning
and
stretching
himself
keep
a
sharp
lookout
and
have
your
rifle
within
reach
at
all
times
that
is
no
more
than
common
brown
eyes
i
know
what
to
do
just
you
turn
in
for
a
night
of
sweet
dreams
leaving
all
the
rest
to
hippy
reaching
her
tent
grace
paused
and
stood
looking
out
until
she
saw
hippy
stroll
away
and
disappear
in
the
darkness
she
then
undressed
crept
in
between
the
blankets
and
immediately
went
to
sleep
it
seemed
to
grace
that
she
had
been
asleep
but
a
few
moments
when
dreaming
of
the
war
she
was
awakened
by
what
in
her
dream
sounded
like
the
explosion
of
a
shell
grace
sprang
up
and
ran
to
the
door
of
her
tent
two
heavy
rifle
reports
told
her
that
trouble
was
afoot
and
she
surmised
that
lieutenant
wingate
was
in
the
thick
of
it
but
hearing
the
lieutenant
calling
to
ike
in
an
effort
to
locate
him
grace
began
to
wonder
the
apache
trail
lay
a
short
distance
above
the
overton
camp
the
creek
near
which
the
ponies
were
tethered
being
about
an
equal
distance
below
the
camp
the
shooting
she
discovered
was
occurring
somewhere
between
the
camp
and
the
trail
grace
stepped
out
into
the
open
facing
the
trail
just
in
time
to
hear
a
bullet
whistle
over
her
head
she
ducked
instinctively
watch
the
camp
lieutenant
she
heard
ike
fairweather
call
going
with
you
answered
hippy
we
attacked
called
elfreda
briggs
from
her
tent
are
you
there
know
what
the
trouble
is
elfreda
but
she
broke
off
abruptly
as
a
sudden
thought
came
to
her
out
for
the
camp
elfreda
without
a
word
of
explanation
grace
whirled
and
sped
toward
the
spot
where
the
horses
were
staked
to
her
rear
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
the
apache
trail
she
heard
two
more
rifle
reports
but
whether
from
the
weapons
in
the
hands
of
ike
fairweather
and
lieutenant
wingate
or
from
other
sources
she
was
unable
to
determine
nearing
the
tethering
ground
grace
proceeded
with
more
caution
not
knowing
what
new
menace
she
might
find
confronting
her
there
but
the
murmur
of
pinal
creek
was
the
only
sound
that
interrupted
the
mountain
stillness
a
stillness
that
on
this
occasion
seemed
heavy
with
significance
at
the
edge
of
the
tethering
ground
grace
halted
sharply
and
peered
about
her
every
one
of
them
gone
she
gasped
suspected
this
very
thing
this
is
too
grace
started
to
return
to
camp
and
tripped
over
a
tethering
stake
measuring
her
length
on
the
ground
before
rising
she
fingered
the
stake
and
the
short
piece
of
rope
still
attached
to
it
she
finally
untied
the
rope
and
with
it
started
for
the
camp
at
a
brisk
trot
as
grace
neared
the
tents
ike
and
hippy
came
in
from
the
trail
side
winged
one
critter
cried
ike
as
he
espied
grace
was
towards
the
camp
when
i
discovered
him
you

i
kinder
thought
was
wrong
so
i
picked
up
a
rifle
went
out
for
trouble

i
the
critter

purpose

replied
grace
dryly

ike
sensing
a
deeper
meaning
behind
grace

disappeared

fairweather
recognizing

it
close
to
his
eyes
and
regarded
it
critically
while
stroking
his
whiskers
with
his
other
hand

he
declared
after
an
instant
of
hesitation

grace
who
already
was
running
to
catch
up
with

he
having
strode
away
too
excited
for
words
not
a
word
was
exchanged
between
them
until
they
reached
the
tethering
ground
when
grace
suggested
that
he
use
her
flash
lamp
which
she
handed
to
him
for
the
following
few
minutes
ike
fairweather
uttered
nothing
but
grunts
now
and
then
pointing
to
the
ground
as
he
followed
the
faintly
discernible
of
their
ponies
down
to
the
creek
there
the
trail
turned
and
followed
along
the
bank
of
the
stream
for
a
short
distance
whence
it
took
a
turn
toward
the
apache
trail
which
grace
and
ike
reached
shortly
afterwards
see
thet
ike
pointed
down
to
the
apache
trail
on
which
a
beam
from
the
flash
lamp
was
resting
see
horse
tracks
if
that
is
what
you
mean
sir
i
suppose
they
are
the
tracks
of
our
ponies
and
if
so
they
appear
to
be
headed
towards
shore
are
miss
listen
while
i
was
the
fellow
thet
was
the
camp
three
other
galoots
was
the
ponies
i
found
the
tracks
back
there
you
can
see
right
here
on
the
trail
what
them
critters
have
done
is
to
start
your
ponies
towards
home
the
horses
are
a
long
ways
from
here
this
very
minute
we
shore
are
in
a
fix
what
do
you
reckon
on
it
demanded
ike
caressing
his
whiskers
and
regarding
his
companion
questioningly
we
return
to
camp
and
talk
it
over
suggested
grace
ike
nodded
and
they
started
back
toward
the
camp
reaching
there
grace
quickly
explained
to
her
companions
what
had
occurred
and
asked
if
any
one
had
a
suggestion
to
offer
as
to
what
should
be
done
in
the
emergency
you
think
the
ponies
will
go
all
the
way
to
globe
asked
lieutenant
wingate
shore
leads
you
to
believe
that
the
robbers
who
took
the
animals
did
not
go
away
with
them
interjected
miss
briggs
tracks
of
the
men
miss
after
they
reached
the
apache
trail
the
horses
started
on
alone
at
a
gallop
as
you
can
see
by
the
the
critters
went
over
the
edge
of
the
trail
hit
it
up
for
the
hills
how
i
see
only
one
way
out
of
our
difficulty
spoke
up
grace
who
had
been
pondering
over
the
problem
have
your
wagon
team
fairweather
that
much
is
saved
to
us
so
i
would
suggest
that
you
take
one
of
the
wagon
horses
and
start
at
once
for
globe
to
fetch
our
ponies
hippy
said
he
would
accompany
fairweather
but
grace
negatived
his
proposal
with
an
emphatic
shake
of
the
head
may
be
needed
here
lieutenant
she
said
fairweather
find
that
he
needs
assistance
in
leading
the
ponies
back
to
camp
he
will
hire
a
man
to
ride
out
with
him
will
you
do
all
this
for
us
fairweather
reckon
but
first
like
to
get
the
critter
thet
teased
me
out
of
camp
while
the
others
stole
the
ponies
the
old
driver
fumed
under
his
breath
ike
saddled
up
in
a
hurry
grace
in
the
meantime
filling
a
kit
bag
with
food
which
she
handed
to
the
driver
hippy
i
believe
you
have
something
to
say
to
me
reminded
grace
as
ike
disappeared
in
the
darkness
eyes
i
was
asleep
when
this
thing
started
lieutenant
wingate
confessed
wingate
rebuked
nora
i
was
but
only
for
a
few
minutes
it
was
right
after
i
had
made
my
trip
to
inspect
the
camp
after
grace
turned
in
everything
was
snug
and
quiet
so
i
leaned
my
rifle
against
a
tree
and
sat
down
well
i
lost
myself
all
i
ought
to
be
said
it
approved
emma
dean
promise
you
on
my
honor
that
it
will
not
occur
again
protested
hippy
woke
you
up
asked
grace
first
thought
so
nodded
grace
must
have
known
you
were
asleep
but
ike
never
mentioned
it
to
me
please
listen
to
me
lieutenant
we
are
really
in
a
serious
situation
at
this
moment
the
thieves
who
took
our
horses
probably
had
a
further
plan
in
mind
at
the
time
and
i
should
not
be
at
all
surprised
if
they
attempted
to
carry
it
out
this
very
what
are
we
to
infer
from
that
remark
loyalheart
asked
miss
briggs
a
bit
anxiously
mean
that
this
camp
may
be
attacked
before
morning
that
in
all
probability
it
will
be
declared

hippy
calls
to
arms
emma
dean
uttered
a
cry
of
alarm
an
overton
girl
admonished
elfreda
briggs
i
help
it
i
afraid
wailed
emma
starting
for
her
tent
where
she
threw
herself
on
her
cot
and
gave
way
to
tears
grace
in
the
meantime
was
making
suggestions
to
hippy
as
to
how
the
camp
should
be
guarded
during
the
rest
of
the
night
after
he
had
faithfully
promised
that
he
would
never
again
nap
grace
turned
toward
her
own
tent
it
was
fully
an
hour
later
before
grace
succeeded
in
quieting
her
nerves
sufficiently
to
permit
her
to
go
to
sleep
she
awakened
with
a
start
a
few
moments
later
after
listening
and
hearing
nothing
grace
decided
that
hers
was
wholly
a
case
of
nerves
and
again
tried
to
sleep
it
was
useless
she
could
not
make
her
eyelids
stay
closed
a
figure
darkened
the
tent
opening
called
lieutenant
wingate
in
a
low
guarded
voice
what
is
it
she
demanded
a
bunch
of
prowlers
near
where
the
ponies
were
but
what
they
are
doing
i
make
out
without
going
down
there
i
thought
best
to
call
you
away
while
i
dress
i
will
be
with
you
in
a
moment
awaken
the
girls
just
are
they
she
whispered
stepping
up
beside
him
hippy
pointed
towards
the
creek
see
them
now
but
i
did
just
before
you
came
out
he
said
your
place
please
and
keep
a
sharp
lookout
i
want
to
take
a
look
from
the
other
side
of
the
grace
crept
away
in
the
darkness
but
in
a
few
moments
came
back
are
up
near
the
trail
now
and
i
think
they
are
mounted
for
i
heard
a
horse
whinney
declared
grace
running
to
the
tents
she
awakened
her
companions
elfreda
was
directed
to
take
her
place
out
in
front
with
lieutenant
wingate
and
grace
to
assist
in
defending
the
camp
the
three
defenders
were
armed
with
rifles
in
addition
to
which
hippy
and
grace
each
carried
a
revolver
is
the
plan
questioned
hippy
seeking
final
directions
we
be
shot
at
we
will
shoot
back
all
i
can
say
in
advance
replied
grace
they
see
us
loyalheart
whispered
miss
briggs
i
think
not
the
camp
lies
in
a
deep
shadow
and
we
have
no
fire
burning
hark
hear
it
muttered
lieutenant
wingate
hear
horses
your
fire
and
await
developments
we
must
not
make
the
mistake
of
shooting
at
some
one
who
deserve
it
cautioned
grace
heaven
what
is
that
cried
elfreda
a
shrill
weird
yell
which
grace
instantly
recognized
as
an
indian
war
whoop
split
the
stillness
of
mountain
and
canyon
many
had
been
the
time
in
the
forest
depths
that
grace
husband
had
uttered
this
thrilling
war
cry
for
her
benefit
in
fact
he
had
taught
grace
herself
to
do
it
war
whoop
she
answered
girls
going
to
get
it
warned
hippy
flat
everybody
called
grace
the
of
the
galloping
horses
of
the
night
marauders
were
now
plainly
heard
by
each
member
of
the
overton
party
another
yell
then
a
rattling
rifle
fire
swept
the
camp
we
shoot
questioned
elfreda
anxiously
not
yet
answered
grace
briefly
think
they
are
going
to
circle
the
camp
volunteered
lieutenant
wingate
will
wait
until
they
have
made
the
circuit
then
let
them
have
it
unless
you
have
a
better
plan
lieutenant
every
one
keep
down
as
low
as
possible
and
take
no
chances
she
called
to
nora
anne
and
emma
the
three
defenders
assumed
a
crouching
attitude
and
waited
the
attackers
were
howling
and
shooting
at
the
same
time
their
bullets
being
fired
so
low
that
grace
feared
some
of
her
party
would
be
hit
horses
and
men
out
there
in
the
valley
were
dim
shadows
unreal
to
the
little
group
of
defenders
but
real
enough
when
it
came
to
the
rifles
that
were
sending
out
darting
flashes
of
fire
and
whistling
bullets
as
the
riders
completed
their
first
circuit
of
the
camp
and
drew
in
closer
lieutenant
wingate
without
waiting
for
further
orders
threw
the
rifle
to
his
shoulder
and
fired
a
few
seconds
later
grace
followed
with
a
shot
then
miss
briggs
pulled
the
trigger
of
her
weapon
it
up
urged
hippy
them
all
the
way
around
with
your
fire
and
take
advantage
of
all
the
cover
you
can
the
overton
outfit
was
in
the
fight
in
deadly
earnest
now
darting
here
and
there
to
keep
the
attackers
in
view
the
two
girls
and
lieutenant
wingate
continued
to
fire
their
rifles
until
at
least
two
shoulders
were
aching
from
the
kick
of
the
weapons
the
spirited
defense
of
the
three
plucky
campers
must
have
amazed
their
assailants
for
the
men
drew
off
a
little
and
cut
a
wider
circle
on
the
next
circuit
of
the
camp
but
still
keeping
up
and
receiving
a
rapid
fire
all
the
way
around
out
changed
their
tactics
warned
hippy
charging
us
the
fools
hold
fire
till
in
easy
reach
then
give
it
to
just
let
it
slowly
peter
out
now
cut
it
off
all
at
the
overton
fire
was
permitted
to
die
out
by
degrees
finally
ceasing
altogether
the
strategy
of
grace
and
hippy
had
accomplished
what
they
wished
it
to
do
it
had
made
the
attackers
careless
they
evidently
surmising
from
the
way
the
firing
died
away
that
the
defenders
either
had
been
killed
or
wounded
uttering
shrill
yells
and
shooting
it
seemed
with
every
jump
of
their
horses
the
night
riders
swept
down
on
the
little
camp
in
squaw
valley
determined
to
put
a
speedy
finish
to
their
work
fire
commanded
lieutenant
wingate
the
defenders
opened
up
on
the
advancing
horsemen
firing
as
rapidly
as
they
could
pull
the
triggers
of
their
rifles
a
moment
or
so
of
this
apparently
was
enough
for
the
attackers
who
suddenly
whirled
and
raced
their
horses
further
out
where
they
again
began
shooting
with
bullets
from
the
camp
still
following
them
have
on
the
run
keep
going
urged
hippy
trying
to
locate
their
assailants
whose
rifles
at
that
instant
had
suddenly
ceased
firing
now
and
then
one
or
another
of
the
defenders
discovering
a
movement
among
the
marauders
would
shoot
but
such
shots
elicited
no
reply
hippy
finally
advised
that
the
defenders
divide
their
force
and
each
take
a
side
of
the
camp
to
avoid
a
surprise
which
was
done
it
all
over
cried
emma
dean
from
her
hiding
place
hope
so
but
keep
down
close
to
the
ground
for
the
present
advised
miss
briggs
you
girls
all
right
but
not
riotously
happy
returned
anne
attackers
i
should
say
are
less
so
therefore
worry
answered
elfreda
to
the
great
relief
of
the
campers
not
another
shot
was
fired
in
squaw
valley
that
night
the
attackers
having
disappeared
as
mysteriously
as
they
came
nor
did
the
overton
party
know
whether
they
had
been
attacked
by
white
men
or
indians
over
but
the
shouting
cried
hippy
as
the
day
began
to
dawn
laying
his
rifle
aside
that
out
there
he
demanded
pointing
to
an
object
that
lay
some
two
hundred
yards
from
the
camp
believe
it
is
a
horse
hippy
wingate
we
have
killed
a
horse
exclaimed
grace
harlowe
in
amazement
that
is
too
bad
shame
chortled
hippy
and
there
is
another
one
down
near
the
creek
added
miss
briggs
excitedly
did
it
with
my
trusty
rifle
cried
hippy
boastfully
are
welcome
to
all
the
glory
there
is
answered
grace
we
have
a
look
at
the
animals
perhaps
we
may
learn
something
come
we
will
take
our
rifles
with
the
overton
defenders
had
succeeded
better
than
they
knew
not
only
had
they
driven
off
a
superior
number
of
desperate
men
but
they
had
shot
from
under
their
attackers
two
horses
and
possibly
downed
as
many
riders
chapter
ix
a
startling
discovery
is
my
opinion
that
this
is
an
indian
pony
announced
lieutenant
wingate
bending
over
the
dead
horse
nearest
to
the
camp
do
you
know
questioned
grace
giving
hippy
a
swift
glance
to
learn
if
he
were
in
earnest
it
looks
like
pictures
of
indian
ponies
that
i
have
grace
smiled
but
made
no
comment
is
a
rifle
under
the
critter
too
he
added
wonder
what
happened
to
the
rider
it
an
indian
rifle
asked
miss
briggs
in
all
seriousness
hippy
confessed
that
he
did
not
know
believe
you
would
qualify
as
an
expert
on
things
indian
laughed
grace
starting
on
with
her
companions
toward
the
creek
to
look
at
the
second
victim
of
the
overton
shooting
they
found
nothing
on
that
pony
except
saddle
and
bridle
remove
the
equipment
from
them
lieutenant
grace
requested
will
take
the
rifle
i
wish
fairweather
to
examine
the
sincerely
hope
he
knows
more
about
indians
than
hippy
does
observed
elfreda
dryly
you
think
those
scoundrels
will
come
back
questioned
elfreda
as
they
were
returning
to
camp
in
the
daytime
if
you
mean
will
they
bother
us
in
future
i
will
say
yes
and
being
a
prudent
person
i
shall
try
to
be
prepared
for
them
this
are
a
queer
girl
loyalheart
the
longer
i
know
you
the
less
i
understand
you
you
are
the
gentlest
sweetest
woman
i
have
ever
known
but
under
the
surface
you
have
an
armor
of
steel
declared
miss
briggs
mountain
air
surely
is
making
you
elfreda
dear
laughingly
retorted
grace
harlowe
am
a
woman
like
yourself
no
different
and
like
yourself
i
have
fairly
good
control
over
my
nervous
system
youth
and
years
of
outdoor
activity
have
given
me
the
qualities
you
have
in
that
is
it
it
has
given
you
something
else
too
it
has
given
you
beauty
of
face
and
figure
given
you
a
better
understanding
and
a
greater
love
for
your
friends
and
mankind
in
grace
nodded
over
the
latter
sentiment
all
young
women
could
come
to
understand
what
outdoor
life
means
to
one
i
do
not
believe
they
would
cling
to
the
town
to
their
late
hours
late
suppers
and
rounds
of
social
pleasures
it
is
no
especial
credit
to
a
woman
to
be
beautiful
it
is
her
duty
to
be
so
any
woman
whom
nature
has
endowed
with
a
substantial
physical
foundation
may
be
beautiful
but
not
from
wearing
fashionable
clothes
or
the
use
of
cosmetics
right
here
in
the
open
is
the
remedy
free
to
all
the
open
spots
elfreda
free
air
healthful
wholesome
exercise
and
right
thinking
and
right
doing
pardon
me
dear
i
do
not
often
open
my
heart
like
this
though
i
think
of
these
things
every
day
of
my
call
yours
a
pretty
good
religion
declared
elfreda
with
emphasis
do
not
call
it
my
religion
objected
grace
is
it
my
rule
of
practice
one
might
call
it
the
application
of
the
greater
are
wading
into
deep
water
suppose
we
have
breakfast
twinkled
miss
briggs
some
time
i
propose
that
we
go
for
a
tramp
along
the
creek
and
up
the
nearby
canyons
and
practice
a
little
of
what
i
am
preaching
to
you
we
will
all
go
and
have
the
best
kind
of
a
time
ah
nora
and
anne
are
getting
plenty
of
food
cried
hippy
as
he
came
in
a
few
moments
later
with
the
saddles
and
bridles
of
the
dead
horses
night

and

about
the
fight
of
the
previous
night
not
forgetting
to
give
himself
all
the
credit

which
he
considered
himself
entitled

afraid

going
through
a
great
war
one
should
not

nerves
after
breakfast
the
defenders
turned
in
for
a
few
sleep
nora
and
anne
in
the
meantime
standing
guard
over
the
camp
no
trouble
was
looked
for
during
the
day
but
grace
fully
expected
that
they
would
have
plenty
of
it
in
one
form
or
another
when
darkness
had
settled
over
the
valley
this
apprehension
was
not
permitted
to
interfere
with
their
enjoyment
of
the
day
so
after
the
sleepers
had
finished
their
naps
mess
kits
were
packed
and
the
party
started
toward
the
creek
for
an
picnic
grace
had
a
twofold
reason
for
wishing
to
go
to
the
creek
and
up
the
canyons
first
she
hoped
to
put
her
companions
in
a
better
frame
of
mind
and
for
herself
she
wished
to
satisfy
her
curiosity
as
to
the
direction
that
the
night
raiders
took
after
the
overton
party
drove
them
off
hippy
wingate
was
left
to
watch
the
camp
and
to
sleep
as
grace
suspected
that
he
would
do
grace
harlowe
with
rifle
under
her
arm
led
her
party
singing
college
songs
as
she
tripped
along
just
as
she
and
her
companions
were
wont
to
do
when
picnicking
in
the
overton
hills
reaching
pinal
creek
the
party
followed
it
along
for
a
short
distance
then
turned
off
into
a
canyon
where
they
finally
camped
and
spread
their
luncheon
on
the
ground
by
the
side
of
a
rippling
mountain
stream
there
they
ate
and
chatted
grace
had
studied
the
ground
along
creek
and
canyon
for
indications
of
the
course
taken
by
the
night
raiders
after
the
battle
the
however
seemed
to
end
at
the
bank
of
pinal
creek
and
she
was
unable
to
pick
them
up
again
the
other
girls
following
the
luncheon
amused
themselves
with
lying
flat
on
their
backs
gazing
up
the
sheer
walls
of
the
canyon
at
the
ribbon
of
blue
sky
lined
out
by
the
tops
of
the
canyon
walls
later
on
they
strolled
off
singly
and
in
pairs
in
search
of
wild
flowers
going
up
this
canyon
called
grace
who
had
risen
and
picked
her
way
along
the
little
stream
that
joined
pinal
creek
some
distance
below
them
any
one
of
you
gets
into
difficulties
give
the
overton
to
you
called
nora
it
was
more
than
an
hour
later
when
grace
came
sauntering
downstream
humming
happily
for
the
vastness
of
the
mountains
and
the
grandeur
of
the
scenery
had
thrilled
and
entranced
her
anne
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
point
where
the
girls
had
taken
their
luncheon
are
the
girls
called
grace
as
she
espied
her
companion
somewhere
they
said
not
to
worry
as
they
might
keep
on
going
until
they
reached
the
is
getting
late
and
i
think
it
advisable
for
all
to
return
to
camp
at
once
come
along
anne
dear
i
stirred
up
something
up
there
that
i
believe
to
be
a
large
wild
animal
that
is
i
heard
it
but
could
not
see
it
should
we
still
be
in
camp
in
the
valley
i
hope
to
go
hunting
for
you
yourself
are
not
hunted
suggested
anne
grace
laughed
you
think
i
am
quite
able
to
take
care
of
myself
she
asked
to
a
certain
point
yes
beyond
that
i
am
another
case
of
nerves
anne
dear
so
forget
it
and
enjoy
the
scenery
yonder
is
where
we
turn
to
take
the
trail
for
home
the
girls
must
have
tired
of
wandering
in
this
wonderful
arm
in
arm
the
two
girls
strolled
back
towards
the
camp
chatting
laughing
and
enjoying
the
bracing
mountain
air
girls
are
at
the
camp
said
anne
pointing
have
an
idea
that
they
did
not
feel
wholly
safe
in
the
mountains
replied
grace
really
believe
that
i
could
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
here
and
without
ever
knowing
a
moment
of
chided
anne
laughingly
as
she
and
grace
entered
the
camp
alert
eyes
instantly
missed
one
of
the
overton
girls

she
gone
to
bed
she
demanded
wondered
miss
briggs
left
her
with
anne
nora
informed
them
and
emma
went
downstream
a
few
moments
after
you
girls
went
away
she
said
she
would
go
back
to
camp
gathering
flowers
on
the
way
interjected
anne
long
was
this
before
i
joined
you
anne
questioned
grace
turning
to
her
companion

say
about
of
an
hour
answered
anne
a
worried
look
creeping
into
her
eyes
this
demanded
lieutenant

missing

she
will
turn
up
all
right
comforted
nora
lose
emma
dean
so
please
get
a
rifle
and
come
with
me
directed
grace
incisively
i
should
like
to
have
you
go
with
us
but
it
is
more
important
that
you
remain
here
to
look
after
the
camp
should
we
not
find
emma
soon
i
will
fire
three
interval
shots
for

will
then
hurry
to
me
but
in
that
event
bring
nora
and
anne
with
you
in
no
circumstances
leave
them
here
grace
issued
her
directions
calmly
but
there
was
that
in
her
tone
that
brought
a
worried
look
to
four
pairs
of
eyes
that
she
suspected
more
than
appeared
on
the
surface
was
apparent
to
all
you
think
that
anything
ha
as
happened
to
emma
do
you
begged
anne
something
serious
surely
has
happened
to
emma
dean
gravely
responded
grace
harlowe
elfreda
we
must
not
lose
an
instant
you
people
be
alert
for
rifle
chapter
x
a
double
capture
grace
started
away
at
a
brisk
trot
followed
by
elfreda
briggs
until
they
reached
the
bank
of
the
creek
gracious
loyalheart
but
you
can
race
gasped
elfreda
work
downstream
elfreda
watch
carefully
for
footprints
and
broken
twigs
i
shall
proceed
upstream
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
above
here
several
deep
canyons
branch
off
and
it
is
possible
that
emma
may
have
taken
one
of
these
in
search
of
flowers
and
lost
her
way
said
grace
far
shall
i
go
questioned
miss
briggs
me
here
in
an
hour
should
you
need
me
in
the
meantime
or
should
you
find
emma
fire
three
signal
shots
with
an
interval
between
each
shot
if
in
need
of
assistance
i
will
do
the
same
and
should
you
hear
three
interval
shots
answer
them
by
the
same
signal
with
your
rifle
that
will
be
a
warning
to
the
camp
as
well
hippy
understands
that
in
case
we
give
such
a
signal
he
is
to
come
on
the
run
and
bring
the
girls
with
him
so
that
they
may
not
be
left
alone
in
the
camp
and
the
best
of
grace
turned
and
hurried
up
the
stream
elfreda
proceeding
in
the
opposite
direction
grace
ran
on
until
she
reached
the
point
where
the
narrow
canyons
radiated
out
from
the
one
the
girls
had
first
taken
on
their
way
to
the
picnic
ground
a
stream
of
clear
sparkling
mountain
water
was
rippling
down
each
radiating
canyon
and
fragrant
wild
flowers
gently
nodded
their
greeting
along
the
bank
of
the
stream
from
the
crevices
of
rocks
and
from
little
patches
of
dirt
that
clung
precariously
to
the
mountainside
do
not
believe
emma
dean
could
resist
these
flowers
murmured
grace
in
order
to
observe
both
banks
grace
stepped
into
the
stream
that
flowed
from
the
larger
of
the
canyons
and
waded
along
it
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
water
instantly
took
all
feeling
from
her
feet
her
whole
attention
being
centered
on
the
banks
of
the
stream
grace
was
peering
at
the
wild
flowers
looking
for
plucked
stems
the
overton
girl
suddenly
uttered
an
exclamation
and
sank
down
on
her
knees
at
the
edge
of
the
creek
plucked
flowers
some
one
has
picked
them
within
a
few
hours
for
the
stems
are
still
grace
began
examining
the
ground
with
infinite
care
but
though
she
found
flowers
that
had
been
crushed
down
she
failed
to
find
a
single
distinct
footprint
further
up
the
stream
however
she
came
upon
that
for
which
she
had
been
searching
the
imprint
of
a
human
foot
a
small
slender
foot
reasonably
certain
that
she
had
at
last
come
upon
the
trail
of
her
missing
companion
grace
sprang
up
and
ran
as
rapidly
as
the
rough
going
would
permit
plunging
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
canyon
that
was
now
dimmed
with
the
gloom
of
the
approaching
mountain
night
the
overton
first
impression
was
that
she
should
fire
her
rifle
but
believing
that
emma
could
not
be
far
away
unless
she
had
wandered
into
still
another
canyon
and
become
wholly
lost
in
the
maze
grace
decided
first
to
search
a
little
further
at
several
such
canyon
intersections
grace
herself
became
confused
but
careful
examination
of
a
few
yards
of
her
own
trail
to
the
rear
soon
set
her
straight
from
time
to
time
she
would
pause
and
raise
her
voice
in
a
call
that
must
have
reached
far
up
the
canyon
and
up
the
mountainside
as
well
shall
have
to
signal
for
assistance
finally
decided
grace
the
gloom
now
having
become
so
deep
that
she
was
no
longer
able
to
distinguish
the
marks
left
by
emma
shoes
hippy
and
the
girls
come
we
will
build
fires
and
with
torches
follow
the
trail
until
we
find
grace
decided
to
signal
for
assistance
and
pointing
her
rifle
into
the
air
she
fired
three
times
at
intervals
she
waited
listening
intently
there
was
no
response
that
she
could
hear
so
she
fired
three
more
signal
shots
this
time
three
faint
reports
were
borne
to
her
ears
but
whether
they
were
the
echoes
of
her
own
shots
or
the
answer
to
her
signals
grace
did
not
know
when
about
to
move
forward
again
nerves
gave
a
tremendous
jump
as
a
human
voice
sounded
close
at
hand
do
you
all
reckon
at
demanded
the
voice
it
was
a
voice
which
in
the
circumstances
was
a
welcome
thing
to
grace
harlowe
even
though
it
was
a
voice
that
she
did
not
know
grace
whirled
and
brought
her
rifle
to
bear
on
the
owner
of
the
voice
she
peered
into
the
darkness
and
was
barely
able
to
make
out
the
form
of
the
speaker
are
you
demanded
grace
reckon
better
say
for
yourself
answered
the
woman
well
i
am
looking
for
a
young
woman
who
is
missing
from
my
party
and
who
i
believe
came
up
this
her
name
dean
yes
cried
grace
have
found
her
reckon
so
the
kid
fell
down
and
hurt
herself
a
little
up
the
canyon
a
piece
show
thank
the
woman
turned
and
strode
away
grace
following
her
anxiety
for
emma
banishing
all
thoughts
from
mind
of
the
strangeness
of
this
presence
in
the
dark
canyon
with
the
rifle
still
tucked
under
her
arm
grace
stumbled
along
over
the
rough
ground
managing
to
keep
up
with
her
guide
at
the
expense
of
several
falls
grace
knew
that
she
was
proceeding
in
the
direction
which
she
believed
emma
had
followed
and
she
was
therefore
eager
to
get
ahead
as
rapidly
as
possible
miss
dean
badly
hurt
she
questioned
anxiously
stepping
up
beside
her
companion
her
ankle
all
was
the
brief
reply
that
is
too
bad
how
much
further
have
we
to
go
there
now
miss
dean
are
you
there
cried
grace
oh
grace
save
me
wailed
emma
dean
grace
harlowe
sprang
forward
ahead
of
her
companion
but
she
did
not
reach
emma
a
pair
of
wiry
arms
were
suddenly
thrown
about
her
pinioning
the
overton
arms
to
her
sides
grace
wriggled
and
struggled
desperately
using
every
trick
she
knew
to
free
herself
and
appeared
to
be
getting
the
best
of
the
struggle
when
an
interruption
occurred
cried
the
woman
sharply
a
man
sprang
forward
in
response
to
the
call
her
gun
panted
the
woman
a
the
rifle
was
wrenched
from
hand
then
the
man
jerked
her
hands
behind
her
back
and
tied
them
there
i
reckon
as
do
much
more
right
smart
declared
the
woman
releasing
her
grip
and
stepping
back
breathing
heavily
grace
too
was
breathing
hard
but
more
from
resentment
than
from
exhaustion
she
now
swiftly
began
to
reason
out
the
meaning
of
what
had
occurred
and
in
a
moment
it
became
clear
to
her
that
she
was
in
the
hands
of
the
band
that
had
been
harassing
the
overton
girls
on
the
apache
trail
are
you
hurt
called
grace
my
feelings
wrecked
answered
emma
with
a
touch
of
her
humor
here
where
you
be
commanded
the
woman
are
not
otherwise
hurt
begged
grace
answered
emma
woman
if
you
do
not
mind
explaining
the
meaning
of
this
affair
i
am
quite
ready
to
listen
announced
grace
harlowe
evenly
at
the
same
time
facing
her
captor
whose
face
she
had
not
yet
been
able
to
see
in
the
darkness
up
ordered
the
man
got
to
git
out
of
here
on
the
jump
belle
you
rustle
her
along
if
she
gits
balky
hit
her
a
clip
over
the
haid
you
owe
her
one
demand
that
you
release
us
both
instantly
answered
grace
without
replying
the
woman
roughly
grasped
grace
by
an
arm
and
propelled
her
along
at
a
swift
pace
grace
stumbling
over
nearly
every
step
of
the
way
until
they
came
up
with
two
men
who
were
guarding
several
horses
at
this
juncture
the
man
addressed
as
came
hurrying
up
to
them
leading
emma
dean
her
hands
also
were
securely
bound
behind
her
and
emma
was
abusing
and
threatening
her
conductor
at
every
step
of
the
way
grace
she
cried
plaintively
when
she
was
halted
close
by
her
friend
quiet
emma
please
warned
grace
your
hands
tied
the
brutes
tied
the
rope
so
tight
that
it
hurts
we
untie
your
hands
will
you
promise
not
to
try
to
get
away
questioned
belle
addressing
both
girls
answered
grace
with
emphasis
the
woman
shrugged
her
shoulders
them
loose
she
ordered
ride
thet
way
without
off
you
women
if
you
try
to
run
away
be
shot
all
warned
belle
as
bud
severed
the
ropes
that
held
the
hands
of
the
two
girls
up
both
of
you
be
lively
it
too
he
ordered
pointing
to
one
of
the
horses
grace
took
all
the
time
in
mounting
that
she
dared
and
emma
crowded
into
the
saddle
behind
her
the
critter
his
haid
he
knows
where
to
go
you
do
i
reckon
advised
bud
swinging
into
his
own
saddle
the
woman
rode
up
and
took
the
lead
bud
falling
in
behind
grace
and
emma
grace
saw
one
man
ride
forward
and
join
belle
while
still
another
remained
behind
standing
by
his
horse
evidently
he
was
not
going
with
them
the
party
then
started
up
the
canyon
the
ponies
now
and
then
breaking
into
a
trot
as
the
footing
permitted
soon
after
the
start
they
began
climbing
the
mountain
side
along
what
grace
realized
was
a
narrow
trail
too
narrow
for
safety
and
on
which
the
ordinarily
ponies
slipped
and
stumbled
perilously
me
what
occurred
whispered
grace
to
her
companion
was
picking
flowers
when
that
woman
caught
hold
of
me
i
never
heard
her
approach
and
she
nearly
scared
me
out
of
my
wits
when
she
grabbed
me
and
clapped
a
hand
over
my
mouth
grace
i
overheard
the
woman
and
that
fellow
bud
talking
and
i
learned
some
things
you
guess
why
they
have
stolen
revenge
i
presume
for
what
we
did
to
con
bates
and
his
fellows
this
undoubtedly
is
the
gang
that
has
been
harassing
that
is
one
reason
the
other
is
that
they
hope
to
get
some
money
for
mean
ransom
asked
grace
in
a
guarded
whisper
it
silly
romantic
that
is
it
eh
they
will
have
a
fine
time
getting
it
i
still
have
my
revolver
inside
my
waist
emma
dean
and
if
necessary
i
shall
use
it
i
think
they
will
dare
to
really
harm
us
but
we
must
be
on
the
alert
every
minute
for
an
opportunity
to
escape
leave
all
that
to
me
for
i
shall
know
when
the
time
is
opportune
for
such
a
move
on
our
if
they
search
you
and
find
the
revolver
questioned
emma
had
better
not
try
it
muttered
grace
she
told
emma
that
the
overton
outfit
were
no
doubt
even
then
searching
for
them
though
she
said
she
doubted
the
ability
of
the
searchers
to
pick
up
and
follow
the
trail
fairweather
get
back
in
time
he
can
and
will
follow
it
and
i
shall
expect
him
to
do
that
very
thing
above
all
keep
your
head
emma
dear
and
do
not
talk
too
much
the
less
they
know
about
us
the
better
i
believe
they
know
who
i
am
and
i
sincerely
hope
they
do
not
find
they
do
know
how
i
even
guess
but
one
of
the
men
came
up
and
reported
to
that
ruffian
bud
that
you
were
coming
up
the
trail
with
belle
he
referred
to
you
as
the
mused
grace
are
sharper
than
i
thought
hold
tight
to
me
emma
it
do
at
all
for
either
of
us
to
slip
off
we
are
liable
to
be
shot
if
we
as
they
worked
their
way
up
the
mountain
trail
grace
tore
bits
of
linen
from
her
handkerchief
and
cautiously
allowed
them
to
drift
to
the
ground
hoping
thereby
to
so
mark
the
trail
that
their
friends
would
see
and
understand
the
captors
did
not
speak
a
word
to
the
girls
slipping
hoofs
creaking
leather
and
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
ponies
being
the
only
sounds
accompanying
the
journey
some
time
near
morning
a
halt
was
made
and
for
a
few
minutes
bud
and
the
woman
sat
on
their
ponies
listening
grace
surmised
that
they
had
heard
something
either
this
or
they
were
expecting
to
hear
something
a
few
minutes
later
the
man
who
had
been
left
down
in
the
canyon
came
jogging
up
to
them
giving
a
signal
whistle
while
still
some
distance
to
the
rear
the
woman
rode
out
a
few
yards
to
meet
the
newcomer
and
was
joined
by
bud
whereupon
an
animated
but
conversation
between
the
three
ensued
on
to
be
some
rough
warned
belle
as
she
galloped
up
to
the
two
girls
following
the
conference
got
to
make
a
certain
place
before
no
funny
business
neither
she
added
warningly
it
was
a
grilling
ride
that
the
overton
girls
experienced
during
the
next
two
hours
a
halt
finally
was
called
to
enable
two
of
the
men
to
go
back
and
mask
the
trail
of
the
ponies
but
just
how
it
was
done
grace
was
unable
to
see
owing
to
the
darkness
that
still
enshrouded
the
mountains
day
dawned
slowly
finding
the
party
threading
its
way
through
rocky
defiles
now
well
at
the
top
of
the
ridge
of
mountains
gray
rolling
hills
and
rocky
towers
were
all
about
them
and
in
the
east
the
grayness
of
the
skies
was
gradually
giving
way
to
pale
rose
and
silver
that
lengthened
and
brightened
along
a
horizon
broken
by
many
mountain
peaks
the
party
finally
came
to
a
halt
in
an
open
space
well
screened
by
rocks
from
view
of
any
roving
eyes
that
might
be
observing
from
near
or
distant
mountain
tops
there
the
captors
made
a
hurried
breakfast
grace
and
emma
were
directed
to
help
themselves
to
food
which
they
did
then
sat
down
by
themselves
to
eat
under
the
observant
eyes
of
their
captors
the
men
plainly
were
ill
at
ease
and
it
was
evident
that
they
still
were
listening
expectantly
finally
one
of
the
men
saddled
his
horse
and
rode
back
he
soon
being
lost
to
sight
among
the
rocks
ruffians
really
fear
that
they
are
being
followed
muttered
grace
barely
loud
enough
for
emma
for
whose
ears
the
words
were
intended
to
hear
have
sent
that
fellow
back
to
take
an
observation
i
wonder
if
they
have
good
reason
for
thinking
that
they
being
followed
we
cut
and
run
suggested
emma
is
nothing
to
hinder
our
doing
so
except
that
we
probably
should
be
shot
before
we
reached
yonder
comes
belle
now
whispered
emma
excitedly
quiet
please
and
let
me
do
the
talking
advised
grace
the
woman
was
approaching
the
two
girls
at
a
rapid
step
an
expression
in
her
eyes
that
grace
harlowe
did
not
like
in
repose
face
while
regular
and
rather
attractive
at
first
glance
showed
hard
lines
particularly
about
the
mouth
indicating
that
when
occasion
demanded
she
could
be
hard
and
merciless
the
expression
that
the
face
of
their
captor
wore
as
she
came
towards
them
gave
promise
that
the
present
might
be
such
an
occasion
belle
halted
before
the
overton
girls
and
stood
regarding
them
through
narrowed
eyelids
then
she
spoke
and
what
she
had
to
say
brought
a
pallor
to
emma
face
and
stirred
the
fighting
instincts
of
grace
harlowe
to
the
danger
point
chapter
xi
following
a
cold
trail
tell
you
i
heard
signal
shots
protested
elfreda
briggs
in
reply
to
declaration
that

fired
by
elfreda
as
i

given
it
averred
the

if

you

that
going
to

terrible
canyon

nora
indignantly
not

an
effort
to
find
them
i
mean
that
i
should
sit
by
the
campfire
and
wait
for
daylight
going
hippy
slung
his
rifle
under
his
arm
and
strode
off
toward
the
creek
anything
break
loose

he
called

reaching
the
creek
the
lieutenant
trudged
along
it
to
the
canyon
elfreda
having
told
him
that
grace
had
gone
in
that
direction
he
examined
the
bank
of
the
creek
with
a
pocket
lamp
that
anne
had
handed
to
him
as
grace
had
done
before
him
but
failed
to
find
footprints
when
he
arrived
at
the
point
from
which
other
canyons
radiated
the
lieutenant
took
the
wrong
one
and
wandered
along
its
course
for
half
a
mile
finding
nothing
of
what
he
sought
he
returned
to
the
creek
and
searched
along
a
second
canyon
and
so
on
until
finally
reaching
the
dark
ravine
through
which
grace
really
had
gone
in
search
of
emma
hippy
on
the
contrary
failed
to
find
a
trail
it
was
long
past
midnight
when
finally
he
gave
up
his
search
and
started
back
to
the
camp
as
he
neared
it
he
discovered
by
the
light
of
the
campfire

a
string
of
ponies
was
being
led
down
from
the
apache
trail
comes

cried
the
lieutenant
in
a
relieved
tone
hippy
started
on
a
run
for
the
camp
by
the
time
he
reached
there
ike
had
arrived
and
the
overton
girls
were
gathered
about

hippy
hurried
along
and
joined
fairweather
and
together
they
saddled
and
bridled
and
then
strode
down
to
the
creek
leading
their
mounts
ike
took
the
flash
lamp
and
soon
after
reaching
the
stream
he
picked
up
the
trail
of
the
overton
party
on
their
way
to
the
picnic
grounds
he
found
lieutenant
footprints
also
reaching
the
point
where
other
trails
radiated
out
from
the
main
canyon
ike
bade
his
companion
hold
the
horses
then
began
a
painstaking
examination
of
the
ground
along
the
little
mountain
stream
a
proceeding
that
excited
lieutenant
admiration
after
a
time
light
disappeared
and
hippy
was
left
in
the
somber
canyon
to
pass
the
time
as
best
he
might
ike
was
gone
an
hour
he
returned
without
showing
a
light
hippy
heard
him
when
he
was
almost
upon
him
and
challenged
ike
was
the
brief
answer
luck
questioned
hippy
the
trail
stands
out
like
a
boulevard
in
a
big
city
found
else
was
it
where
some
woman
met
one
of
ours
went
with
her
up
the
canyon
it
a
regular
white
footprint
thet
the
woman
made
reckon
it
was
an
indian
or
some
mountain
woman
she
had
on
moccasins
there
was
three
or
four
men
a
little
further
upstream
they
had
horses
i
found
this
up
there
it
ike
held
out
something
white
and
turned
the
ray
of
the
flash
lamp
on
it
muttered
hippy
should
say
this
is
miss
handkerchief
well
what
next
hands
got
on
the
horses
and
went
on
up
the
canyon
i
come
back
from
that
you
are
a
wonder
how
do
you
do
it
i
read
the
story
of
a
trail
the
way
you
do
if
i
was
to
practice
it
all
the
rest
of
my
i
reckon
thet
if
i
tried
to
sail
one
of
them
machines
my
name
would
be
dennis
right
smart
replied
ike
aboard
right
up
thet
trail
and
to
keep
till
either
we
lose
it
for
good
or
find
the
gals
or
get
shot
one
or
we
pull
off
wait
till
may
be
too
hippy
swung
into
his
saddle
ike
being
but
a
few
seconds
behind
him
in
mounting
fairweather
taking
the
lead
at
a
slow
jog
trot
where
they
took
to
the
ponies
announced
ike
finally
how
he
knew
that
in
the
darkness
hippy
was
unable
to
imagine
but
then
hippy
wingate
had
not
followed
mountain
trails
at
any
stage
of
his
career
and
knew
nothing
of
them
ike
now
began
to
flash
his
light
against
the
mountain
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
the
command
came
out
sharp
and
incisive
my
nag
the
old
driver
dismounted
and
handing
his
bridle
rein
to
his
companion
began
climbing
up
along
the
mountainside
keeping
the
ray
of
his
light
directly
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
ike
returned
in
a
few
minutes
reckon
got
to
do
some
tall
ourselves
party
went
up
the
mountain
ike
mounted
and
started
up
a
twisting
narrow
trail
his
light
now
in
almost
continuous
use
for
the
going
was
extremely
perilous
them
bits
of
white
cloth
alongside
the
trail
ike
called
back
had
not
noticed
them
i
see
them
now
answered
hippy
markers
that
gray
dropped
to
show
us
the
way
a
real
gal
hippy
marveled
in
silence
day
was
breaking
when
they
reached
the
top
and
looking
back
hippy
found
himself
wondering
how
they
ever
made
it
for
the
mountain
they
had
climbed
looked
to
lieutenant
wingate
to
be
straight
up
and
down
ike
fairweather
again
dismounted
was
searching
the
ground
running
back
and
forth
covering
wider
and
wider
stretches
of
rock
and
earth
continuously
combing
his
whiskers
with
his
fingers
and
perspiring
freely
ike
finally
returned
to
his
companion
his
chagrin
reflected
in
his
face
the
matter
ike
asked
hippy
in
a
cheerful
voice
a
tone
that
at
the
moment
did
not
reflect
his
real
feelings
plumb
locoed
lieutenant
lost
the
trail
i
know
where
to
look
for
it
a
mighty
big
place
up
here
mebby
we
find
the
track
mebby
we
leastwise
sorry
for
the
gals
who
bet
are
their
eyes
out
for
are
excited
ike
sit
down
consult
your
whiskers
and
perhaps
you
may
find
an
idea
or
something
in
them
suggested
hippy
gravely
ike
promptly
adopted
his
suggestion
and
for
the
next
several
minutes
gave
himself
up
to
reflection
punctuated
with
an
occasional
throaty
growl
got
it
got
it
lieutenant
cried
ike
springing
up
a
cold
trail
with
snow
or
something
on
it
questioned
hippy
innocently
seen
snow
in
these
mountains
but
i
presume
there
is
plenty
of
no
lieutenant
a
cold
a
fixed
trail
doctored
so
as
to
mislead
a
trailer
or
covered
up
altogether
so
he
find
it
i
reckon
ike
fairweather
to
be
fooled
by
no
cheap
mountain
trick
like
thet
lieutenant
you
work
to
the
right
while
i
go
to
the
left
take
a
wide
circle
along
the
top
of
the
mountain
come
up
with
me
by
thet
monument
you
can
see
the
top
of
over
to
the
watch
the
ground
like
sixty
watch
out
for
broken
twigs
crushed
clumps
of
grass
if
you
find
any
sit
still
wait
for
hippy
wingate
wheeled
his
pony
and
trotted
off
to
the
right
peering
at
the
ground
a
puzzled
expression
in
his
eyes
know
a
frozen
trail
or
whatever
you
call
it
if
i
saw
one
he
muttered
helplessly
chapter
xii
an
interrupted
interview

with
me
gray
commanded
the
woman
who
had
lured
grace
to
capture
reckon
you
and

got
to
do

what
you
mean
but
i
am
ready
announced
grace
rising
emma
set
where
you
be
ordered
belle
savagely
eyes
flashed
her
resentment
and
for
a
few
seconds
grace
feared
that
her
little
companion
was
about
to
do
something
rash
miss
dean
who
had
started
to
rise
now
settled
back
face
flushed
her
whole
body
but
more
from
anger
than
from
fear
i
want
you
call
you
was
the
parting
admonition
as
she
turned
away
nodding
to
grace
to
follow
her
belle
led
her
captive
off
behind
some
rocks
within
easy
calling
distance
of
the
group
of
bandits
who
were
still
munching
at
their
breakfast
and
at
the
same
time
keeping
an
eye
on
emma
dean
the
instant
that
grace
could
do
so
without
being
observed
by
the
men
she
thrust
her
hand
inside
her
tunic
and
quickly
transferred
her
automatic
revolver
to
the
right
hand
pocket
she
was
now
walking
along
with
both
hands
in
her
pockets
feeling
more
confidence
in
herself
now
that
a
means
of
defense
lay
within
her
right
hand
the
mountain
woman
halted
behind
a
wall
of
rock
and
leaning
against
it
surveyed
grace
with
malignant
eyes
harlowe
woman
what
do
you
reckon
i
ought
to
do
to
you
she
demanded
reckon
better
do
anything
to
me
except
to
permit
myself
and
companion
to
return
to
our
camp
answered
grace
lounging
carelessly
scuffing
the
dirt
with
the
toe
of
her
boot
but
not
permitting
her
gaze
to
leave
the
face
of
the
mountain
woman
for
a
second
if

their
efforts

so
for
what

may
have
done

me
or
to
my
companion

demanded
the
woman
her
hand
slipping
to
the
revolver
that
swung
in
its
holster
from
her
hip
i
am
simply
stating
a
fact
and
you
know
it
calmly
replied
grace

grace

what
i
is
your
husband
bates
belle
bates
to
see
to
it
thet
you
settle
for
thet
little
job
you
you
are
the
wife
of
that
highwayman
eh
i
begin
to
understand
what
is
it
you
wish
me
to
do
up
right
questioned
grace
now
smilingly
reckon
you
got
money
or
you
be
out
on
a
trip
like
you
be
you
will
write
a
letter
to
your
friends
telling
them
to
shell
out
all
the
money
they
have
to
leave
it
in
a
certain
place
that
tell
you
then
to
get
back
to
globe
as
fast
as
hoss
flesh
will
carry
and
then
you
all
get
out
of
the
country
stay
you
believe
they
will
be
foolish
enough
to
leave
money
for
one
of
your
gang
to
go
and
help
himself
to
i
believe
you
know
my
friends
why
your
messenger
never
could
get
away
with
anything
so
simple
as
that
let
us
consider
this
matter
suppose
i
do
write
the
sort
of
letter
you
demand
and
further
that
by
this
childish
subterfuge
you
get
such
money
as
our
outfit
has
with
it
what
will
be
your
next
move
what
do
you
then
propose
to
do
with
miss
dean
and
myself
reckon
mebby
let
you
eh
that
is
too
indefinite
but
i
presume
it
is
as
good
as
the
word
of
an
outlaw
like
yourself
can
be
replied
grace
boldly
i
refuse
to
do
as
you
request
what
then
bandit
serve
you
as
you
served
con
only
more
do
you
know
my
name
questioned
grace
more
for
the
sake
of
gaining
time
to
further
plan
to
outwit
this
woman
whom
grace
fully
believed
meant
to
do
something
desperate
than
because
she
cared
to
know
she
saw
too
that
belle
bates
was
working
herself
into
a
high
pitch
of
excitement
and
anger
that
might
result
in
greater
peril
for
her
captives
none
of
your
business
retorted
belle
in
reply
to
the
overton
question
me
suggest
another
plan
if
you
will
send
miss
dean
with
the
letter
to
my
friends
i
will
write
to
them
that
they
are
to
deposit
if
they
wish
a
certain
amount
of
money
in
whatever
place
you
may
anything
green
in
my
eyes
jeered
the
wife
plan
is
no
more
foolish
than
yours
i
suggested
it
merely
to
prove
to
you
that
yours
will
not
stand
the
test
why
belle
bates
if
such
a
thing
as
ransom
for
me
were
suggested
to
them
my
friends
would
throw
your
messenger
out
of
camp
and
probably
into
pinal
creek
they
would
then
nose
out
your
trail
and
they
would
follow
you
until
yourself
and
every
member
of
your
thieving
band
were
in
jail
or
worse
you
can
expect
nothing
less
for
you
are
as
bad
as
the
worst
of
your
miserable
outfit
added
grace
belle
face
was
not
pleasant
to
look
upon
at
that
moment
and
her
rage
was
rapidly
getting
the
better
of
what
little
judgment
she
possessed
this
was
exactly
what
grace
harlowe
was
seeking
to
accomplish
to
get
her
captor
in
such
a
rage
that
she
would
do
something
that
would
give
grace
an
advantage
nor
did
the
overton
girl
overlook
the
possibility
that
belle
rage
might
lead
to
the
using
her
revolver
on
her
tantalizer
fortunately
for
grace
the
situation
did
not
develop
that
way
with
a
cry
of
rage
belle
sprang
at
grace
harlowe
with
clenched
fists
fix
that
purty
face
of
yours
she
cried
and
launched
a
swift
blow
at
her
captive
the
overton
girl
smiling
aggravatingly
had
stood
calmly
awaiting
the
rush
and
easily
dodged
the
blow
that
the
bates
woman
struck
at
her
at
that
point
grace
harlowe
got
into
action
her
left
hand
shot
out
and
was
as
swiftly
withdrawn
holding
in
it
the
heavy
revolver
which
she
had
snatched
from
belle
holster
grace
instantly
sprang
back
out
of
reach
of
those
wiry
arms
whose
strength
she
already
had
felt
and
pointed
the
weapon
at
her
adversary
your
hands
over
your
head
she
commanded
sternly
utter
a
sound
or
shoot
now
back
up
against
the
rock
behind
kill
you
for
this
fumed
the
woman
belle
bates
had
been
trained
in
the
hard
school
of
the
mountains
she
had
faced
weapons
before
and
she
had
seen
others
face
them
as
well
as
some
who
went
down
before
them
one
glance
into
the
brown
eyes
that
were
looking
along
the
barrel
of
her
own
revolver
told
belle
that
grace
harlowe
meant
what
she
had
said
and
that
she
possessed
the
nerve
to
carry
out
her
threat
around
facing
the
rock
and
rest
your
hands
against
it
as
high
above
your
head
as
you
can
reach
commanded
grace
the
woman
obeyed
sullenly
will
now
call
to
miss
dean
to
come
here
be
careful
how
you
do
it
too
and
remember
what
is
behind
you
i
hope
there
is
nothing
behind
added
grace
to
herself
belle
hesitated
grace
uttered
another
warning
a
more
insistent
one
whereupon
the
mountain
woman
called
to
emma
dean
to
come
to
her
thet
gun
do
it
quick
came
the
sharp
command
in
a
voice
behind
grace
harlowe
the
overton
heart
seemed
to
leap
into
her
throat
she
felt
a
suffocating
sensation
there
her
breath
coming
only
with
great
effort
and
she
could
feel
herself
going
cold
all
over
chapter
xiii
a
struggle
for
life
grace
what
is
it
cried
emma
who
at
this
juncture
arrived
on
the
scene
grace
reaction
came
with
words
whirling
in
a
flash
grace
dropped
to
her
knees
just
as
the
revolver
of
the
bandit
was
fired
at
her
how
the
fellow
had
managed
to
get
behind
her
without
her
knowing
it
grace
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
a
cry
behind
her
now
told
grace
that
the
bullet
intended
for
her
had
hit
belle
bates
instead
it
was
now
a
question
of
fight
or
be
killed
or
both
so
far
as
grace
was
concerned
and
coming
close
on
the
discharge
of
the
revolver
she
took
a
quick
shot
at
the
fellow
following
it
up
with
a
second
shot
as
the
bandit
again
fired
the
man
staggered
under
the
overton
second
shot
and
collapsed
on
the
ground
cried
grace
emma
emma
dean
paused
hesitatingly
then
darted
away
but
the
instant
she
was
out
of
sight
of
the
bandits
emma
stopped
short
to
wait
for
her
companion
grace
was
still
in
the
thick
of
trouble
but
though
the
wounded
bandit
lying
flat
on
his
back
continued
to
shoot
the
overton
girl
was
thankful
that
belle
bates
had
no
weapon
to
use
on
her
though
the
fight
had
been
under
way
less
than
twenty
seconds
the
bandits
were
already
running
to
the
scene
grace
following
her
second
shot
had
darted
away
calling
to
emma
as
she
ran
after
us
admonished
grace
as
she
came
up
with
emma
a
scattering
fire
of
revolver
bullets
spattered
on
the
rocks
about
them
but
by
lively
sprinting
they
soon
succeeded
in
placing
substantial
barriers
of
rock
between
them
and
their
pursuers
the
bandits
of
course
possessed
the
advantage
of
long
experience
in
this
sort
of
warfare
but
mind
was
an
alert
one
quick
to
receive
impressions
and
quick
to
react
hear
horses
coming
panted
emma
taken
to
the
ponies
we
must
get
where
the
ponies
can
not
conveniently
go
and
do
it
quick
run
on
your
toes
be
careful
not
to
leave
a
footprint
anywhere
cautioned
grace
it
was
soon
apparent
from
the
sounds
however
that
the
horsemen
were
overtaking
the
girls
though
grace
felt
reasonably
certain
that
the
bandits
did
not
know
where
she
and
emma
at
that
moment
were
in
the
circumstances
there
appeared
only
one
way
to
avoid
discovery
and
that
was
to
do
some
skillful
dodging
which
the
two
girls
promptly
did
when
the
pursuers
drew
closer
to
them
grace
and
emma
hid
behind
a
rock
and
as
the
riders
swept
down
toward
them
moved
step
by
step
around
it
so
that
the
rock
should
always
be
between
them
and
the
bandits
the
outlaws
swung
by
at
a
brisk
gallop
which
left
grace
and
emma
to
the
rear
of
their
pursuers
we
must
find
a
hiding
place
urged
grace
harlowe
there
is
blood
on
your
face
cried
emma
as
they
ran
you
hit
got
a
scratch
on
the
head
a
bullet
scratched
my
scalp
when
i
started
to
run
away
from
the
fight
grinned
grace
the
way
was
now
becoming
more
rugged
but
the
girls
did
not
lessen
their
pace
and
for
nearly
an
hour
they
continued
their
plunging
stumbling
sprint
at
the
expense
of
many
falls
and
bruises
thankful
that
thus
far
they
had
succeeded
in
eluding
their
pursuers
illustration
the
outlaws
swung
by
go
any
further
wailed
emma
simply
must
emma
this
is
too
exposed
a
place
for
us
to
halt
there
what
did
i
tell
you
a
rifle
bullet
had
against
a
rock
close
at
hand
and
ricochetted
off
with
a
weird
g
g
followed
by
the
report
of
a
rifle
emma
suddenly
forgot
her
weariness
and
together
the
girls
fled
from
that
danger
spot
now
that
their
presence
had
been
discovered
grace
decided
to
make
another
change
of
course
which
she
did
instantly
it
was
a
fortunate
change
too
for
it
led
the
girls
to
the
edge
of
the
mountain
a
few
yards
below
where
they
were
standing
grace
saw
a
shelf
of
rock
jutting
out
and
rightly
surmised
that
beneath
that
they
might
find
a
hiding
place
getting
to
the
shelf
and
underneath
it
without
leaving
a
trail
was
difficult
but
they
succeeded
in
accomplishing
it
down
and
try
to
get
some
sleep
advised
grace
after
the
two
had
squeezed
in
under
the
shelf
are
in
no
immediate
danger
being
on
the
verge
of
utter
exhaustion
emma
dean
needed
no
urging
and
almost
immediately
sank
into
a
deep
sleep
while
grace
lay
back
with
closed
eyes
getting
what
rest
she
could
and
reflecting
over
the
exciting
incidents
of
the
last
few
hours
as
for
the
bandit
she
had
shot
she
did
not
believe
his
wound
to
be
a
serious
one
grace
had
aimed
for
the
upper
left
limb
and
believed
she
had
hit
it
she
had
not
had
time
to
turn
to
see
how
seriously
belle
bates
was
wounded
nothing
more
having
been
heard
of
the
bandits
grace
finally
turned
her
attention
to
the
important
matter
of
getting
back
to
the
overton
camp
first
she
got
her
points
of
compass
from
the
sun
but
this
did
not
greatly
assist
her
not
knowing
to
a
certainty
in
which
direction
the
camp
lay
not
a
familiar
landmark
could
she
find
up
we
must
be
going
said
grace
gently
shaking
her
companion
dear
so
lame
and
stiff
that
i
believe
i
can
you
prefer
to
remain
here
and
starve
or
be
captured
again
suggested
grace
emma
got
up
and
said
she
was
ready
the
two
girls
then
started
off
as
briskly
as
miss
sore
joints
would
permit
they
continued
on
until
four
in
the
afternoon
without
finding
the
trail
over
which
they
had
ridden
to
the
mountain
top
fear
we
shall
not
find
it
dear
grace
finally
admitted
what
are
we
to
do
pleaded
emma
so
hungry
so
thirsty
and
so
have
been
thinking
of
that
and
looking
over
the
landscape
at
the
same
time
it
seems
to
me
that
the
second
canyon
over
there
should
lead
us
somewhere
near
our
camp
look
to
your
right
and
you
will
observe
that
the
second
canyon
appears
to
merge
into
the
one
immediately
in
our
foreground
so
we
will
try
to
get
down
the
mountain
and
work
our
way
toward
the
point
of
intersection
shall
find
water
to
drink
in
the
canyon
and
we
must
watch
sharply
for
berries
of
which
i
saw
many
when
out
picnicking
other
than
a
few
berries
we
can
not
hope
to
get
much
of
anything
to
eat
until
we
reach
emma
groaned
they
then
began
a
cautious
descent
of
the
mountain
creeping
from
rock
to
rock
slipping
and
sliding
now
and
then
at
the
imminent
peril
of
being
dashed
to
death
on
the
rocks
far
below
them
is
a
bush
of
mountain
berries
come
and
get
them
but
be
careful
not
to
fall
grace
called
to
her
companion
emma
upon
reaching
the
bush
threw
herself
down
beside
it
and
ate
ravenously
then
suddenly
realizing
that
her
companion
had
not
had
a
taste
of
the
berries
she
shamefacedly
begged
pardon
for
her
greediness
the
bottom
of
the
canyon
was
in
deep
shadow
when
the
girls
finally
reached
it
though
it
was
still
daylight
on
the
mountain
top
a
rippling
stream
of
water
at
their
feet
for
the
moment
put
all
other
thoughts
out
of
the
minds
of
grace
harlowe
and
emma
dean
and
they
drank
and
choked
until
they
could
drink
no
more
and
after
bathing
their
faces
in
the
cold
mountain
stream
they
arose
from
the
brook
greatly
refreshed
was
almost
as
good
as
a
meal
declared
grace
will
have
to
answer
for
my
meal
because
i
failed
to
find
more
emma
made
no
reply
to
this
but
she
thought
volumes
of
uncomplimentary
things
about
herself
now
that
the
chill
night
air
was
settling
over
the
mountains
the
wound
in
scalp
began
to
stiffen
and
give
her
considerable
pain
but
she
kept
her
suffering
to
herself
and
taking
emma
by
the
hand
began
trudging
down
the
canyon
that
already
was
in
impenetrable
darkness
they
stumbled
on
for
hours
until
finally
emma
gave
out
entirely
i
simply
can
not
go
another
step
she
wailed
lighting
a
match
grace
peered
into
the
face
of
her
little
companion
and
she
saw
that
emma
really
was
suffering
from
exhaustion
right
little
pard
we
will
camp
right
here
i
wish
i
had
a
light
i
lost
my
pocket
lamp
yesterday
but
i
am
going
to
try
to
make
a
fire
you
sit
down
and
do
the
best
you
can
while
i
feel
about
for
the
after
accumulating
a
few
handfuls
of
twigs
that
would
burn
grace
placed
them
beside
emma
and
began
feeling
about
for
a
suitable
camping
place
she
found
one
under
a
projection
of
rock
that
had
been
worn
out
perhaps
by
the
high
waters
of
centuries
there
was
shale
and
dirt
under
the
rocky
shelf
which
grace
partly
scooped
out
with
her
hands
and
a
few
moments
later
a
cheerful
little
fire
was
burning
by
its
light
grace
cleared
away
as
much
more
of
the
dirt
and
shale
as
possible
piling
in
green
boughs
in
their
place
it
safe
to
have
a
fire
questioned
emma
apprehensively
we
must
have
warmth
or
we
shall
freeze
chilled
through
as
we
already
are
get
in
under
the
rock
and
you
will
soon
feel
quite
comfortable
i
you
coming
in
too
asked
emma
after
i
have
laid
in
sufficient
fuel
for
the
night
replied
grace
for
the
fire
you
see
i
have
laid
it
close
to
the
rock
and
i
doubt
if
it
could
be
seen
from
the
top
of
the
wish
i
could
do
things
as
you
do
could
if
you
had
to
there
i
think
we
are
fixed
for
the
night
and
now
i
will
join
you
are
you
comfortable
she
asked
snuggling
down
beside
emma
should
be
were
we
not
in
such
a
mess
thankful
for
small
things
emma
this
really
is
quite
comfy
all
we
need
to
complete
our
comfort
are
a
few
slices
of
bacon
and
a
hot
cup
of
coffee
apiece
chuckled
grace
harlowe
you
are
positively
cruel
to
speak
of
it
rebuked
emma
the
moment
i
had
forgotten
that
i
was
hungry
then
you
had
to
remind
me
of
it
i
could
almost
faint
at
thought
of
how
hungry
i
am
never
never
again
will
i
make
fun
of
hippy
appetite
i
never
knew
what
a
terrible
thing
an
appetite
could
agree
with
you
that
it
can
be
in
some
circumstances
admitted
grace
you
go
to
sleep
i
i
am
too
frightened
protested
emma
it
still
and
the
stillness
in
this
canyon
the
noisiest
thing
you
ever
heard
grace
laughed
merrily
have
expressed
it
exactly
little
woman
please
get
to
sleep
i
shall
not
answer
another
question
so
do
not
ask
grace
kept
her
word
and
preserved
a
stony
silence
to
all
of
her
questions
emma
soon
tiring
of
asking
questions
that
elicited
no
reply
ceased
asking
them
and
finally
dozed
off
to
sleep
grace
harlowe
poked
the
fire
and
put
on
fresh
fuel
from
time
to
time
keeping
her
lonely
vigil
listening
and
wondering
whether
or
not
she
would
ever
be
able
to
find
her
way
back
to
the
camp
of
the
overton
outfit
lulled
by
the
warmth
of
the
fire
and
worn
out
from
her
trying
experience
head
finally
drooped
until
it
rested
on
emma
shoulder
grace
awakened
with
a
start
then
sank
back
into
a
sound
sleep
which
lasted
but
a
few
moments
the
support
of
shoulder
was
suddenly
withdrawn
as
emma
uttering
a
piercing
shriek
leaped
to
her
feet
grace
toppled
over
sideways
but
was
upright
wide
awake
in
an
instant
in
the
light
of
the
fire
that
was
now
burning
low
she
saw
emma
half
standing
half
crouching
her
face
ghastly
pale
her
body
shaking
as
from
a
heavy
chill
is
it
demanded
grace
sharply
i
see
i
heard
gasped
miss
dean
grace
it
was
me
what
frightened
you
insisted
grace
in
a
severe
tone
of
voice
screamed
and
wailed
it
sounded
like
the
wail
of
a
lost
soul
you
know
what
i
having
heard
a
lost
soul
wail
i
the
mountain
silence
must
have
your
wind
up
as
the
soldiers
say
of
a
man
who
is
frightened
lie
down
and
go
to
slee
grace
got
no
further
the
silent
surcharged
air
split
to
a
piercing
scream
followed
by
a
frightful
wail
of
agony
it
was
with
an
effort
that
grace
restrained
herself
from
leaping
to
her
feet
as
emma
dean
again
screamed
but
the
cold
chills
were
racing
up
and
down
her
spine
her
nerves
partly
out
of
control
stand
it
oh
grace
grace
save
me
emma
weeping
hysterically
threw
herself
into
her
arms
as
that
wail
of
agony
again
woke
the
echoes
of
the
canyon
this
time
seeming
to
be
directly
over
their
heads
chapter
xiv
a
night
of
terror
grace
harlowe
was
frightened
at
least
for
a
moment
she
felt
her
nerves
giving
way
under
the
strain
and
she
feared
she
too
was
going
to
scream
instead
she
gave
emma
dean
a
severe
shaking
it
i
tell
you
you
will
have
the
bandits
down
on
us
next
goodness
knows
we
have
trouble
enough
on
our
hands
without
again
having
to
deal
with
those
care
i
prefer
bandits
rather
than
to
have
that
terrible
thing
in
the
air
over
me
cried
emma
is
an
animal
though
i
must
admit
that
the
wail
did
sound
like
the
voice
of
a
woman
in
mortal
agony
there
it
goes
again
steady
yourself
emma
be
an
overton
girl
emma
dean
buried
her
head
in
lap
and
again
gave
way
to
a
storm
of
tears
her
whole
body
was
jerking
nervously
but
grace
petted
and
coddled
and
talked
to
her
until
finally
miss
dean
in
a
measure
recovered
her
composure
the
wild
haunting
mournful
wail
was
repeated
emma
shivered
and
so
did
grace
despite
her
but
both
girls
immediately
recovered
their
composure
the
wail
burst
suddenly
appallingly
close
seeming
to
their
overstrained
nerves
to
be
right
under
the
shelter
that
covered
the
overton
girls
emma
dean
leaped
to
her
feet
and
was
about
to
dash
out
into
the
canyon
when
grace
caught
and
hauled
her
back
at
that
instant
the
heavy
thud
of
padded
feet
striking
the
ground
in
front
of
the
camping
place
was
heard
by
both
girls
peering
over
the
little
fire
grace
saw
two
yellow
eyes
out
there
in
the
darkness
emma
discovered
them
at
about
the
same
time
but
she
made
no
sound
save
a
faint
gurgle
in
her
throat
here
was
something
tangible
something
to
give
battle
to
and
a
peril
that
one
could
see
and
face
had
few
terrors
for
grace
harlowe
the
bandit
revolver
that
grace
had
taken
from
belle
bates
was
cautiously
drawn
from
its
holster
grace
took
steady
aim
and
pulled
the
trigger
a
heavy
report
crashed
out
echoing
and
buffeting
the
canyon
walls
far
up
the
dark
mountain
gorge
grace
fired
again
and
this
time
a
scream
of
rage
or
pain
neither
girl
could
decide
which
again
set
the
echoes
screaming
up
the
canyon
but
the
yellow
eyes
were
no
longer
there
when
grace
got
a
clear
view
of
the
scene
your
friend
the
lost
soul
has
at
least
one
bullet
in
his
body
you
see
how
foolish
you
were
to
be
so
frightened
rebuked
grace
forgetful
for
the
moment
that
she
too
had
been
on
the
verge
of
giving
way
to
the
terror
inspired
by
those
agonizing
wails
am
going
to
see
what
i
can
please
leave
me
alone
begged
emma
stand
am
not
going
away
just
out
front
remain
where
you
are
that
beast
may
still
be
lurking
grace
stepped
out
cautiously
carrying
a
flickering
firebrand
in
her
left
hand
the
bandit
revolver
in
her
right
ready
for
instant
action
upon
examining
the
rocks
for
traces
of
their
terrifying
visitor
she
found
fresh
blood
stains
a
trail
of
drops
led
up
the
canyon
from
that
point
but
the
overton
girl
did
not
follow
it
knowing
that
peril
might
lurk
on
that
trail
ever
say
that
i
can
not
shoot
straight
cried
grace
as
she
returned
to
her
companion
hit
the
was
it
questioned
emma
still
pale
and
disturbed
say
for
certain
i
know
i
never
heard
anything
so
as
that
frightful
wail
i
have
been
thinking
and
it
seems
to
me
i
have
heard
that
the
mountain
lion
or
cougar
has
the
wildest
most
agonized
scream
of
anything
in
the
western
you
think
he
will
come
back
do
not
believe
so
were
i
in
his
place
i
i
will
keep
awake
and
watch
that
is
the
prudent
thing
to
do
so
you
lie
down
and
sleep
for
the
rest
of
the
once
more
grace
took
up
her
vigil
and
after
a
time
emma
again
dropped
off
to
sleep
the
excitement
had
set
head
aching
and
the
scalp
wound
pained
her
frightfully
she
tried
to
lie
back
and
doze
but
did
not
succeed
suddenly
three
shots
revolver
shots
she
decided
aroused
grace
to
instant
alertness
listening
intently
she
heard
three
answering
shots
signal
emma
wake
up
at
is
it
cried
miss
dean
starting
up
swaying
a
little
as
she
got
wearily
to
her
feet
up
the
canyon
they
were
signal
shots
too
we
must
put
out
the
fire
and
get
away
from
here
help
me
fetch
water
from
the
stream
to
douse
the
fire
take
your
hat
be
lively
the
fire
being
low
only
a
few
hatfuls
were
necessary
to
extinguish
it
this
done
grace
threw
boughs
from
their
bed
over
the
heap
of
ashes
then
grabbing
emma
by
a
hand
fairly
dragged
her
across
the
stream
and
on
a
few
yards
to
the
opposite
base
of
the
mountain
but
be
careful
directed
grace
the
two
girls
scrambled
up
the
mountainside
until
it
grew
so
steep
that
they
could
go
no
further
down
directed
grace
both
were
breathing
heavily
from
exertion
and
excitement
hear
them
whispered
emma
there
appear
to
be
several
of
them
judging
from
the
voices
answered
grace
the
approaching
party
halted
a
little
way
up
the
canyon
but
the
halt
was
brief
and
the
horsemen
as
such
they
proved
to
be
moved
on
down
as
it
seemed
to
grace
with
greater
caution
for
she
could
no
longer
hear
voices
only
the
soft
hoof
thuds
of
horses
feeling
their
way
in
the
black
night
of
the
canyon
have
stopped
at
our
little
camp
whispered
grace
felt
certain
that
they
would
smell
the
dead
fire
keep
very
quiet
and
be
careful
that
you
do
not
dislodge
a
stone
if
you
do
a
match
was
lighted
down
there
and
for
a
few
seconds
the
dim
outlines
of
horses
were
visible
to
the
watching
listening
girls
a
conference
followed
more
matches
were
lighted
flickering
here
and
there
like
scattered
fireflies
grace
felt
rather
than
saw
that
the
men
were
examining
the
ground
for
trail
signs
if
so
they
failed
to
discover
the
direction
that
the
overton
girls
had
taken
in
their
scramble
up
the
mountainside
they
going
questioned
emma
think
so
keep
quiet
until
we
are
certain
it
may
be
a
trick
to
lure
us
a
few
moments
later
the
horses
of
the
party
were
heard
thudding
down
the
canyon
and
the
two
girls
breathed
with
less
restraint
i
think
those
men
were
our
bandits
i
wonder
what
wonder
if
they
are
not
on
their
way
to
the
overton
camp
emma
dean
i
believe
we
are
in
our
own
canyon
or
near
it
cried
grace
a
trace
of
excitement
in
her
tone
if
we
are
we
can
not
find
our
way
out
in
the
darkness
answered
emma
helplessly
we
can
at
least
we
can
not
get
far
out
of
our
way
unless
we
climb
a
mountain
and
that
we
shall
not
do
get
down
but
be
as
quiet
as
possible
for
we
must
not
be
caught
again
it
will
go
hard
with
us
if
we
they
catch
us
questioned
emma
anxiously
men
are
desperate
but
if
they
get
us
again
it
will
be
after
i
have
no
shells
left
in
my
grace
began
cautiously
scrambling
down
the
mountainside
followed
by
her
companion
who
exhibited
less
caution
the
critical
moment
for
the
girls
was
when
they
reached
the
bottom
and
for
several
moments
after
setting
their
feet
on
solid
ground
they
stood
listening
they
have
gone
decided
grace
slipping
a
hand
into
her
will
follow
the
canyon
until
we
land
they
picked
their
way
as
carefully
as
was
possible
in
the
darkness
but
the
going
was
so
rough
that
grace
finally
took
to
the
little
mountain
stream
and
plodded
on
down
it
until
the
sound
of
a
greater
volume
of
water
ahead
caught
her
ears
she
thereupon
immediately
stepped
from
the
stream
proceeding
with
caution
and
in
a
few
moments
they
came
to
the
stream
that
grace
had
heard
there
the
overton
girl
felt
about
with
her
hands
for
a
time
then
lighted
a
match
she
cried
you
know
where
we
are
are
on
pinal
creek
we
are
almost
home
little
one
and
our
troubles
are
nearly
at
an
end
oh
i
am
so
happy
and
so
hungry
added
grace
laughing
a
little
hysterically
believe
it
run
urged
miss
dean
forget
that
the
bandits
are
somewhere
ahead
of
us
i
suspect
that
they
are
in
the
vicinity
of
our
grace
was
anxious
for
her
friends
no
shots
so
far
as
she
had
heard
had
been
fired
by
them
and
she
began
to
fear
that
perhaps
all
was
not
well
in
the
overton
camp
they
pressed
on
more
rapidly
now
finally
reaching
the
creek
side
of
squaw
valley
no
fire
burned
in
the
camp
nor
could
the
girls
see
the
tents
which
was
not
surprising
for
the
night
in
the
valley
was
almost
as
dark
as
in
the
mountain
canyon
that
they
had
just
left
silence
here
seems
charged
with
possibilities
whispered
grace
alert
am
but
it
seem
to
do
any
good
i
feel
wretched
and
they
go
cried
grace
a
sudden
scattering
fire
of
rifle
shots
somewhere
out
in
the
field
made
the
nerves
jump
go
our
rifles
too
added
grace
as
a
spirited
fire
sprang
up
at
the
point
where
the
two
girls
believed
their
camp
to
be
located
what
shall
we
do
cried
emma
into
a
safe
place
we
have
no
rifles
and
can
do
nothing
to
assist
our
grasping
hand
again
grace
ran
back
to
the
creek
she
ordered
as
bullets
began
to
rustle
the
leaves
over
their
heads
both
girls
threw
themselves
down
and
with
heads
slightly
raised
watched
the
flashes
from
the
rifles
the
outlaws
were
not
riding
this
time
but
were
skulking
fighting
indian
fashion
and
grace
was
now
certain
that
the
bandits
that
had
been
harassing
the
overton
outfit
had
returned
for
another
attack
the
battle
was
being
savagely
waged
on
both
sides
but
who
of
her
companions
were
taking
part
in
it
grace
of
course
did
not
know
the
first
intimation
she
had
that
the
fight
was
ended
was
when
she
saw
four
horsemen
gallop
down
to
the
creek
and
head
up
the
canyon
they
go
announced
grace
harlowe
in
a
relieved
tone
some
one
may
have
been
hand
in
hand
the
girls
dragged
their
weary
feet
across
the
valley
and
up
toward
the
camp
do
you
think
our
people
will
shoo
oot
at
us
stammered
emma
may
at
that
i
will
signal
grace
fired
three
interval
shots
into
the
air
following
it
with
the
overton
hail
which
was
so
weak
that
it
barely
carried
to
the
camp
came
an
answering
shout
from
the
camp
grace
and
emma
soon
discovered
the
figures
of
two
men
approaching
them
at
a
run
there
called
the
voice
of
hippy
wingate
or
answered
grace
weakly
emma
going
to
faint
she
cried
and
collapsed
when
grace
recovered
consciousness
she
was
in
her
own
camp
a
camp
fire
was
blazing
and
a
group
of
anxious
faces
were
bending
over
her
grace
smiled
and
closed
her
eyes
has
fallen
asleep
disturb
her
said
elfreda
briggs
poor
child
is
utterly
exhausted
it
is
a
wonder
that
she
is
alive
after
what
she
plainly
has
gone
chapter
xv
ike
distinguishes
himself
grace
and
emma
following
faint
had
been
carried
into
camp
by
lieutenant
wingate
and
ike
fairweather
emma
giving
way
to
the
reaction
after
her
trying
experience
had
immediately
sunk
into
a
profound
sleep
from
which
they
had
not
awakened
her
the
two
girls
had
been
put
to
bed
neither
awakening
until
long
after
daylight
miss
briggs
had
examined
the
bullet
wound
on
scalp
and
decided
that
it
should
have
attention
as
soon
as
she
awakened
no
one
was
in
her
tent
when
finally
grace
opened
her
eyes
after
a
few
minutes
of
blissful
resting
the
overton
girl
got
up
and
dressed
she
was
a
little
dizzy
at
first
but
the
sensation
quickly
passed
and
she
walked
out
just
as
luncheon
was
being
prepared
there
was
a
shout
of
welcome
as
grace
appeared
and
the
girls
of
the
party
ran
to
her
fairly
overwhelming
her
with
their
joyous
embraces
emma
who
had
awakened
and
dressed
came
out
a
few
minutes
after
grace
are
famished
please

us
something

up
ike
grace
thereupon
related
the
story
of
the
experiences
of
herself
and
emma
touching
briefly
on
her
own
part
in
it
reckon
the
woman
thet
got
shot
is
to
die
observed
ike
do
you
know
questioned
grace
bending
a
keen
glance
on
the
driver
the
bandits
about
it
up
in
the
ike
then
told
of
the
search
that
hippy
and
himself
had
made
for
the
missing
girls
of
their
losing
the
trail
and
not
finding
it
again
and
finally
of
having
discovered
the
bandits
spied
on
them
and
from
their
conversation
learned
that
grace
harlowe
and
emma
dean
had
escaped
ike
said
he
learned
too
that
the
bandits
were
about
to
start
for
the
overton
camp
at
the
direction
of
belle
bates
shoot
the
place
up
for
keeps
as
ike
put
it
hearing
that
and
knowing
that
the
two
girls
had
escaped
ike
and
hippy
started
for
home
as
fast
as
their
horses
could
travel
fully
expecting
to
find
grace
and
emma
at
the
camp
they
had
arrived
at
camp
about
an
hour
before
the
bandits
battle
you
know
i
reckon
western
jones
here
shot
two
of
the
critters
off
their
horses
but
the
galoots
gathered
up
their
wounded
and
rode
away
with
bet

a
one
of

a
cougar
grace
informed
them
after
she
had
described
the
terrifying
scream
of
the
animal
ike
nodded
cougar

have
hit
him

drawn
up
a
soapbox
and
sat
down
on
it
just
outside

gathered
about

his
eyes
were
filled
with
curiosity
ike
did
not
fully
understand
what
was
off
as
he
later
described
it
but
felt
certain
that
he
was
about
to
witness
something
interesting
steeling
herself
to
resist
the
pain
grace
talked
as
miss
briggs
inserted
the
needle
and
began
stitching
the
scalp
together
but
the
lines
of
her
face
showed
the
strain
under
which
grace
was
laboring
you
nearly
finished
with
that
patchwork
she
finally
asked
in
a
queer
strained
voice
more
stitch
and
i
am
done
there
it
is
as
the
frenchmen
would
say
thank
you
emma
i
will

and
uttering

she

turned

here
they

of

next
morning
and
had
been
gone
for
nearly
two
hours
when
the
party
decided
to
start
on

hippy

saddled
their

for

wingate
the
outfit
started
out
led
by
lieutenant
wingate
who
took
a
circuitous
route
to
reach
the
apache
trail
in
order
to
avoid
the
steep
ascent
that
they
would
have
encountered
had
they
taken
a
more
direct
course
to
the
trail
the
eyes
of
the
overton
girls
were
sparkling
for
the
moment
they
had
forgotten
their
troubles
forgotten
the
mysteries
of
the
apache
mountains
forgotten
all
but
the
glorious
morning
and
the
wonders
that
lay
all
about
them
the
first
halt
made
was
at
the
great
forest
of
sahuaro
a
forest
of
giant
cacti
which
flourishes
all
through
the
apache
and
other
mountain
regions
in

almost
equal

our

and
while

was
seeking

as
he
expressed
it
the

got
out
their

grace
built
a

and
in
remarkably
short
time
the

call
was
heard
at
the
edge
of
the

the

nibbled
at
what
they

that
all
you

in

emma
came
back
spiritedly
not
all
what
i
really
was
about
to

was
that

should
have

already
have
a

among
certain

who
have
smelled
our

may

emma

for
you

glowed
hippy
a
chorus
of
laughs
greeted
the
suggestion
of
being
a
stroke
of
genius
i
should
call
that
a
stroke
of
paralysis
declared
nora
is
the
support
that
hippy
wingate
gets
from
his
wife
complained
the
lieutenant
you
blame
her
teased
grace
elfreda
we
have
not

from

have
been
making
sport
of
suggestions
i

to
say
that
he
has
made
an
excellent
one
asserted

elfreda
cried
anne
and

in

voice
will
give
you
to
understand
that
i

asserted
emma

ride
under
any
such
name
either
i
faint
away
first
there
now
the
heroics
emma
nothing
is
further
from
my
mind
than
to
call
our

by
that
name

mock
indignation
raise
my
hopes
to
the

me
with
compliments
calculated
to
prove
that
i

then
you
drop
me
over

i
leave
it
to
nora
if
that
cruelty
to
is
agreed

whereat
the

broke
into
a
peal
of
merry
laughter
are
both
wrong
and
right

i
stand
on
what
i
said
a
few
moments
ago
that
you
made
an
excellent
suggestion
declared
miss
briggs
did
not
mean
that
your
title
was
wholly
good
for
it
interjected
emma

the
love
of
goodness
give
our
legal
talent
a
chance
begged
hippy
frowning
at
emma
mentioned
the
rough
rider
patrol
which
gave
me
the
idea
for
a
name
that
i
think
will
grow
upon
you
as
you
sleep
over
on
hippy
only
snores
follow
in
the
wake
of

when
headed
in
my
direction
retorted
the
lieutenant
what
is
your
suggestion
asked
grace
suggestion
is
that
we
be
known
as
overland
no
protested
grace
some
one
else
a
chance
why
not
as
well
call
us

out
going

again
warned
hippy
sharply
whereat
emma
subsided
are
all
agreed
on
the
question
of
the
name
suggested
by
elfreda
announced
anne
is
a
fine
name
and
can
not
be
improved
can
the
overland
riders
interjected
emma
course
if
you
girls
wish
it
that
way
i
have
no
objection
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
name
should
be
sufficient
without
having
to
hook
my
name
ahead
sounds
like
overton
and
is
a
good
word
for
us

lucky

spun

were
almost
hysterical
with

down

had

had

saved

was
laughing
so
much
that
she
forgot
to
scold
her

kept

laughing
for
as

longer
as
possible
so
that
nora
might
not
remember
to
give
him
the
grilling
that
he

he
deserved

came
however

teased
him
about
letting

outdo

ever
was

conclusion
after

stroking
of

there
followed
another

dismounted

said
grace
show
us
where
to
take
our
ponies
she
requested
a
path
a
narrow
path
used
principally
by
foot
travelers
led
up
the
mountain
side
winding
through
cacti
and
scrub
cottonwoods
for
more
than
a
hundred
yards
and
up
this
narrow
crooked
path
the
overland
riders
led
their
saddle
ponies
finally
emerging
on
a
narrow
mesa
or
tableland
bordered
with
scraggly
cottonwoods
that
found
their
moisture
in
a
nearby
mountain
stream
the
camp
of
the
overton
girls
had
been
pitched
by
this
stream
fresh
water
close
at
hand
being
a
vital
thing
to
outdoor
camps
hippy
wingate
tied
his
pony
to
a
tree
and
stepping
to
the
edge
of
the
mesa
waved
a
hand
toward
the
black
abyss
beyond
and
below
them
yawning
chasm
he
exclaimed
and
sat
down
is
the
most
fascinating
speech
you
ever
made
lieutenant
wingate
observed
miss
briggs
that
so
why
there
were
only
three
words
in
it
interjected
emma
dean
hippy
sniffed
and
getting
up
went
over
and
untied
his
pony
while
the
men
were
staking
down
the
horses
and
fetching
water
for
them
from
the
stream
the
girls
were
busily
engaged
in
preparing
supper
ike
not
only
had
pitched
the
tents
but
had
placed
the
luggage
of
his
charges
in
its
proper
place
and
set
the
camp
in
order
in
advance
of
the
arrival
of
the
party
the
campfire
was
still
low
purposely
kept
so
for
cooking
purposes
but
a
heap
of
wood
nearby
promised
a
cheerful
blaze
later
on
pork
and
beans
bread
without
butter
canned
soup
and
cake
that
hippy
wingate
declared
had
been
baked
on
a
cactus
plant
together
with
a
large
pot
of
coffee
formed
the
principal
part
of
the
bill
of
fare
a
prize
winner
in
variety
but
great
chow
approved
hippy
which
was
high
praise
for
lieutenant
wingate
following
the
meal
elfreda
questioned
the
old
stagecoach
driver
about
the
country
where
they
were
encamped
apache
ground
answered
ike
with
a
comprehensive
wave
of
the
hand
fit
over
every
inch
of
it
see
some
of
them
folks
or
next
day
how
long
do

if
you
folks
care
for
thet

the

sounds
interesting
agreed
grace
of
course
you
know
we
do
not
care
to
camp
where
there
are
people
what
we
are
out
for
is
to
get
away
from
people
what
is
there
in
the
way
of
game
in
the
sierra
ancha
range
bear
cougar
is
the
big
game
plenty
of
smaller
will
talk
with
our
party
about
the
hunting
but
i
hardly
think
they
will
care
for
it
is
it
possible
to
visit
the
cliff
dwellings
questioned
grace
of
others
be
elfreda
glanced
quickly
at
grace
and
frowned
to
herself
mean
that
no
one
has
been
able
to
get
to
them
fairweather
not
cliffs
hundreds
of
feet
up
or
can
get
above
them
i
suppose
persisted
grace
by
a
trail
the
take
a
try
at
exploring
them
observed
hippy
as
if
he
really
meant
it
will
not
if
you
keep
on
eating
declared
nora
there
other
trails
that
lead
to
the
top
i
should
say
that
lead
to
the
mountain
where
these
cliff
dwellers
lived
questioned
grace
other
directions
that
one
could
get
there
without
following
the
route
we
have
taken
thus
far
you
driving
at
grace
demanded
anne
anne
dear
remember
one
never
can
know
too
much
about
he
can
differed
hippy
can
know
too
much
about
overland
riding
i
know
so
much
about
it
already
that
it
pains
me
to
think
about
how
much
i
do
know
and
the
journey
half
over
at
this
rate
i
shall
acquire
so
much
information
that
my
brain
surely
will
blow
up
one
what
asked
emma
innocently
even
ike
fairweather
joined
in
the
laugh
that
followed
nora
nodded
and
smiled
her
approval
at
emma
should
prefer
to
blow
up
from
an
oversupply
of
brains
than
to
faint
because
of
short
measure
retorted
hippy
heatedly
on
ordered
grace
trying
hard
not
to
laugh
was
real
mean
of
you
hippy
wingate
i
think
you
should
apologize
to
right
go
i
do
apologize
miss
dean
my
seeming
rudeness
was
not
rudeness
at
all
it
was
merely
an
effort
on
my
part
to
make
conversation
and
to
maintain
my
reputation
for
making
myself
agreeable
go
further
with
my
apology
and
assure
you
that
i
know
that
it
because
you
are
sometimes
brainless
that
you
fainted
but
because
wingate
rebuked
nora
sharply
shall
never
never
speak
to
you
again
unless
you
tell
emma
you
are
i
mean
it
or
not
do
as
i
ask
you
have
you
another
hat
in
the
wagon
that
i
can
wear
to
town
fairweather
said
he
had
not
am
sorry
miss
dean
and
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
for
my
rude
my
seeming
rudeness
corrected
hippy
face
broke
out
into
smiles
indicating
that
the
clouds
had
passed
are
forgiven
hippy
she
nodded
i
mean
it
or
not
you
i
will
think
it
over
and
let
you
know
whether
or
not
i
do
mean
hippy
lifted
his
head
and
inhaled
a
long
breath
we
are
rapidly
being
enveloped
in
it
exclaimed
anne
who
had
observed
the
action
is
what
you
call
it
i
call
it
a
cloud
i
ought
to
know
for
many
is
the
time
that
i
have
smelled
clouds
declared
hippy
clouds
confirmed
the
old
coach
driver
the
overland
riders
uttered
exclamations
of
amazement
for
being
above
the
clouds
was
a
new
experience
to
all
except
grace
harlowe
who
had
once
made
a
thrilling
flight
with
lieutenant
wingate
on
the
french
front
emma
dean
however
declared
that
she
could
see
nothing
about
fog
to
rave
over
and
it
was
difficult
to
convince
her
that
they
really
were
enveloped
in
clouds
such
as
she
had
seen
drifting
above
the
mountain
tops
all
that
afternoon
grace
proposed
that
they
turn
in
early
that
night
in
order
to
be
up
with
the
sun
and
get
the
benefit
of
the
early
morning
view
which
ike
fairweather
said
was
well
worth
seeing
to
bed
in
the
clouds
how
romantic
murmured
anne
but
why
get
sentimental
over
it
grinned
hippy
it
be
awful
were
we
to
fall
out
of
bed
suggested
emma
ike
fairweather
and
lieutenant
wingate
took
more
than
ordinary
pains
in
staking
down
the
horses
for
the
night
even
though
the
animals
were
tethered
so
close
to
the
camp
that
their
every
move
might
be
heard
by
the
campers
ike
distinctly
objected
to
making
a
second
trip
to
globe
for
a
bunch
of
runaway
ponies
while
the
men
were
engaged
with
the
ponies
the
overton
girls
were
chatting
in
grace
tent
and
elfreda
briggs
was
dressing
the
wound
on
head
is
really
wonderful
how
rapidly
a
wound
heals
with
you
marvelled
miss
briggs
am
well
and
strong
so
why
should
it
not
be
so
replied
grace
hope
you
take
the
bandage
from
my
wound
soon
because
i
wish
to
look
nice
when
we
reach
the
hotel
at
roosevelt
is
secure
sir
announced
hippy
from
without
you
lieutenant
acknowledged
grace
will
find
food
in
the
tin
box
in
the
provided
you
get
hungry
in
the
dreams
and
do
not
fall
out
of
bed
piped
emma
i
do
you
will
hear
me
retorted
hippy
we
surely
shall
feel
the
mountain
shake
when
land
chuckled
anne
all
called
hippy
and
strode
off
laughing
to
himself
a
chorus
of
following
him
for
an
hour
or
more
intermittent
chattering
was
heard
in
the
tents
through
the
open
tent
flaps
they
could
see
the
cloud
fog
swirling
about
and
the
damp
musty
odor
of
the
was
strong
in
their
nostrils
glory
of
the
mountains
how
i
should
love
to
spend
all
summer
right
on
this
wonderful
spot
murmured
grace
and
turning
over
went
quickly
to
sleep
shortly
after
midnight
grace
awakened
and
lay
gazing
out
at
the
drifting
gray
fog
was
that
grace
sat
up
suddenly
listening
for
a
repetition
of
the
sound
that
had
disturbed
her
what
grace
had
heard
sounded
to
her
like
the
rattle
of
a
wagon
followed
by
a
loud
squeak
but
the
sound
was
not
repeated
the
overton
girl
sprang
up
dressed
hurriedly
and
buckled
on
her
revolver
holster
she
then
ran
over
to
lieutenant
tent
and
softly
called
his
name
there
was
no
reply
from
within
nor
could
grace
hear
breathing
there
thrusting
a
flash
lamp
through
the
tent
opening
she
swept
the
interior
with
a
brief
ray
of
light
the
tent
was
unoccupied
and
the
blankets
lay
on
the
ground
in
a
confused
heap
indicating
to
her
that
lieutenant
wingate
had
taken
a
hurried
departure
surely
is
going
on
and
hippy
has
gone
to
investigate
muttered
grace
young
man
surely
is
without
an
hesitation
grace
ran
out
and
down
the
tote
path
proceeding
cautiously
as
she
neared
the
trail
her
step
giving
off
no
sound
that
could
be
heard
a
few
yards
away
chapter
xviii
the
hardest
blow
of
all
reaching
the
trail
grace
crept
toward
the
point
where
the
equipment
wagon
had
been
parked
she
now
understood
the
meaning
of
the
sound
that
she
had
heard
from
her
tent
the
wagon
was
being
turned
and
again
she
heard
what
she
recognized
now
as
the
squeal
of
a
accompanied
by
a
low
guttural
grunt
out
the
command
was
low
but
incisive
a
jar
and
a
crash
followed
then
something
went
thundering
down
the
mountainside
one
has
run
the
wagon
off
the
trail
into
the
canyon
gasped
grace
harlowe
a
revolver
shot
caused
grace
to
duck
she
had
faintly
seen
the
flash
in
the
ahead
of
her
and
the
flash
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
weapon
had
been
fired
at
her
came
two
answering
shots
fired
the
first
shot
i
must
get
in
cried
grace
pressing
close
to
the
rocks
on
the
upper
side
of
the
trail
and
creeping
forward
the
firing
on
both
sides
was
increasing
in
rapidity
and
it
was
apparent
that
a
hot
fight
was
in
progress
four
men
suddenly
ran
past
her
one
being
supported
by
a
companion
on
either
side
but
she
could
barely
discern
the
figures
in
the
fog
commanded
grace
sternly
bringing
her
weapon
up
in
readiness
to
enforce
her
command
the
answer
to
her
challenge
was
a
shot
which
grace
answered
with
a
bullet
from
her
bandit
revolver
but
in
the
mist
all
objects
were
distorted
and
her
aim
was
bad
another
bullet
this
time
from
the
right
whistled
over
grace
head
fired
from
lieutenant
weapon
hippy
had
seen
and
was
firing
at
her
shouted
the
girl
hurry
we
can
get
them
shoot
till
you
catch
up
with
me
hurry
hurry
winged
one
gloated
hippy
it
to
grace
dumped
the
talk
run
and
keep
your
eyes
open
she
admonished
the
outside
of
the
trail
hug
the
the
two
started
on
at
a
fast
but
cautious
sprint
ahead
they
could
hear
voices
have
you
surrender
shouted
lieutenant
wingate
grace
grinned
as
she
ducked
she
had
ducked
in
good
time
too
for
two
bullets
answered
challenge
both
hippy
and
grace
then
opened
up
on
their
adversaries
the
revolver
reports
had
awakened
the
entire
camp
ike
fairweather
had
tumbled
out
of
bed
and
sprang
to
lieutenant
tent
finding
it
unoccupied
he
reasoned
that
hippy
was
in
trouble
down
on
the
trail
the
girls
by
this
time
had
run
from
their
tents
calling
out
to
know
what
was
wrong
know
stay
here
look
out
for
yerselves
flung
back
ike
as
he
dashed
down
the
slope
toward
the
apache
trail
grace
called
anne
excitedly
venture
to
say
that
grace
harlowe
is
already
very
much
awake
and
down
there
in
the
thick
of
it
replied
miss
briggs
calmly
gone
wailed
emma
who
had
run
to
tent
to
give
the
alarm
i
am
so
afraid
something
will
happen
to
hippy
has
gone
too
cried
nora
wingate
be
killed
both
of
them
i
wish
i
never
had
come
to
this
terrible
you
stew
like
that
when
your
husband
was
fighting
boches
in
france
rebuked
elfreda
but
he
fighting
boches
they
go
at
it
again
cried
anne
is
almost
as
exciting
as
france
all
one
needs
to
make
her
believe
she
is
back
on
the
battle
front
is
the
explosion
of
a
hun
down
on
the
apache
trail
the
battle
was
being
waged
with
honors
a
little
in
favor
of
the
overlanders
hippy
had
hit
at
least
one
of
the
prowlers
that
he
knew
but
so
far
he
and
grace
had
escaped
without
a
bullet
coming
close
enough
to
endanger
them
one
man
was
still
working
his
revolver
somewhere
ahead
of
hippy
and
grace
them
have
it
before
they
get
away
she
urged
whereupon
hippy
began
shooting
into
the
fog
with
renewed
vigor
they
go
cried
grace
heard
them
sliding
down
the
bank
come
on
we
may
yet
catch
hippy
turned
his
revolver
in
the
direction
that
grace
was
pointing
and
blazed
away
shouted
a
voice
behind
them
in
the
new
rallying
cry
of
the
outfit
answered
hippy
are
too
late
ike
the
fun
is
all
happened
lieutenant
demanded
the
driver
as
he
sprinted
up
to
them
heard
the
and
lit
out
for
the
wagon
which
i
find
hide
nor
hair
have
lost
your
wagon
fairweather
grace
informed
him
thet
you
say
have
dumped
the
wagon
down
into
the
canyon
and
a
good
part
of
our
equipment
is
with
it
replied
grace
ike
for
the
moment
was
unable
to
find
words
appropriate
to
express
his
emotion
then
recovering
his
voice
he
launched
into
a
torrent
of
threats
as
he
stamped
about
shaking
his
clenched
fists
will
have
to
catch
them
before
you
carry
out
all
those
threats
fairweather
reminded
grace
the
scoundrels
have
a
wounded
man
with
them
and
can
not
move
rapidly
shall
we
go
after
them
answered
hippy
and
i
will
go
you
go
back
and
reassure
the
girls
brown
good
yours
is
the
better
thought
you
would
look
at
it
that
way
observed
hippy
the
two
men
quickly
were
swallowed
up
in
the
mist
and
grace
turned
toward
the
camp
more
disturbed
in
mind
than
she
cared
to
admit
to
herself
should
their
assailants
persist
in
their
attacks
on
the
outfit
it
was
reasonably
certain
that
one
or
more
of
the
overton
party
sooner
or
later
would
be
wounded
or
worse
called
grace
the
call
was
promptly
answered
from
the
camp
and
grace
was
met
at
the
upper
end
of
the
tote
path
by
a
group
of
worried
girls
she
explained
that
hippy
who
had
gone
out
to
intercept
the
work
of
the
night
prowlers
had
continued
on
with
ike
fairweather
in
pursuit
of
them
were
those
ruffians
trying
to
do
this
time
questioned
miss
briggs
not
only
tried
but
they
did
answered
grace
those
rascals
ran
our
equipment
wagon
off
the
trail
and
into
the
a
chorus
of
greeted
the
announcement
this
mean
that
we
shall
have
to
abandon
our
trip
anxiously
asked
elfreda
does
not
elfreda
did
you
ever
know
of
an
overton
girl
to
confess
herself
beaten
that
is
the
last
thing
i
should
look
for
you
to
question
is
answered
we
are
going
to
get
that
band
of
ruffians
before
the
end
of
the
apache
trail
is
reached
or
they
will
get
us
declared
grace
stir
the
fire
and
make
coffee
for
our
men
i
am
going
down
the
tote
trail
to
see
that
we
are
not
crouching
beside
the
trail
grace
finally
heard
hippy
and
ike
returning
got
away
but
we
exchanged
shots
with
them
called
hippy
in
reply
to
hail
went
down
into
the
canyon
but
ike
said
there
was
no
use
wasting
time
following
them
for
they
know
the
ground
better
than
we
do
sorry
but
we
did
the
best
we
surely
did
all
that
any
one
could
have
done
agreed
grace
might
as
well
go
back
to
camp
as
nora
probably
is
worrying
about
you
the
girls
will
have
coffee
for
you
when
you
get
smell
it
it
smells
mighty
good
exclaimed
ike
the
coffee
was
ready
for
them
when
they
arrived
and
anne
was
down
on
her
knees
toasting
bread
before
a
bed
of
coals
all

before

to
take
refreshment
and
to
discuss
their

growled
the
old
stagecoach
driver
shouted
the
girls
and
hippy
came
along
with
a
deep
bass
sudden
concern
appeared
in
the
face
of
emma
dean
at
this
juncture
is
my
black
silk
dress
that
was
in
the
wagon
she
asked
half
fearfully
deep
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
canyon
rumbled
lieutenant
wingate
emma
uttered
a
dismal
wail
going
to
pay
me
for
my
black
silk

going
to

changes
right

canyon

clothing

dusky

ike
gloomily
the
contrary
we
wish

grace

settle
with
you
at
phœnix
we
shall
make
up
to
you
any
loss
that
you
may
have
face
brightened
not
because
of
the
promise

because
the
outfit

not
intend

send
him
home
you
folks
you
make
me
right
happy
you
shore

what
do
you
reckon
on
me
see
we
must
be
about
thirty
miles
from
roosevelt
lake

reflected
grace
three
mile
short
of
thet
nodded
ike
you
think
we
can
pack
what
stuff
we
have
left
on
your
wagon

ponies
questioned
grace

to

much
extra
weight

saddle

just
light
equipment
and
if

through
to
roosevelt
we
will
make

more

eleven
in
the
the
day
after

camp
for

all

that
difficulty
is

i
propose
that
we
now
turn
in
girls

have
time
for
a
beauty
sleep
before
the
rising
of
the
sun
when
i
hope
each
of
you
will
come
out
and
enjoy
the
scene
with
me
nodded
grace
smilingly
the
rest
of
the
night
passed
without
incident
and
ike
sounded
the
call
a
few
minutes
before
there
followed
a
hurried
dressing
some
grumbling
and
finally
much
laughter
because
emma
dean
in
her
attempt
at
haste
got
all
tangled
up
in
her
garments
the
overland
riders
however
found
themselves
well
paid
for
their
early
rising
a
scene
such
as
they
had
never
dreamed
existed
lay
before
them
a
sea
of
clouds
hid
the
valley
and
the
lake
white
billowy
lazy
clouds
that
were
drifting
slowly
under
the
warmth
of
the
rising
sun
above
this
white
sea
loomed
the
four
peaks
of
the
apache
range
turned
to
red
and
gold
by
the
morning
sun
and
on
beyond
the
peaks
here
and
there
a
sapphire
rock
thrust
its
sharp
point
through
the
white
billows
beautiful
murmured
elfreda
briggs
the
power
of
words
to
express
replied
grace
harlowe
barely
above
a
whisper
anne
linked
arms
with
grace
and
patted
her
hand
but
spoke
no
word
even
the
irrepressible
hippy
seemed
lost
in
silent
admiration
perhaps
it
was
the
beauty
of
the
scene
or
perhaps
it
was
that
those
billowing
clouds
carried
him
back
in
memory
to
the
bitter
days
when
lieutenant
wingate
was
fighting
for
life
above
just
such
clouds
as
these
high
over
the
german
lines
in
france
grace
finally
sat
down
chin
in
hand
lost
in
wonder
her
whole
being
filled
with
an
exultation
that
she
had
known
but
once
before
and
then
in
a
far
different
environment
when
caught
in
a
barrage
at
chateau
thierry
when
all
the
tremendous
elements
of
the
universe
seemed
to
have
joined
in
a
mad
medley
that
was
war
bitter
war
this
was
peace
and
she
wondered
that
each
should
arouse
in
her
emotions
that
were
so
much
alike
began
hippy
wingate
impressively
and
the
spell
was
broken
are
now
standing
are
mistaken
some
of
us
are
sitting
corrected
emma
dean
the
pinnacle
of
the
apache
trail
the
most
ancient
trail
on
our
continent
well
may
this
be
called
oldest
america
for
men
have
traversed
this
route
since
remotest
time
where
the
silence
of
eternity
broods
over
the
mesas
and
the
canyons
and
the
peaks
and
where
with
this
wonderful
scene
that
comes
with
the
dawning
of
the
day
all
the
mystery
of
the
world
seems
brought
together
ahem
a
painful
silence
of
several
seconds
was
broken
by
the
judicial
voice
of
elfreda
briggs
sentence
the
prisoner
to
ten
hard
labor
she
announced
shouts
of
laughter
and
a
cry
from
emma
that
he
should
be
sent
up
for
life
put
the
overlanders
in
a
merry
mood
even
ike
fairweather
whose
eyes
had
grown
large
under
the
spell
of
oratory
permitted
himself
to
indulge
in
a
loud
guffaw
after
a
rather
hurried
breakfast
the
outfit
began
packing
up
for
the
start
it
was
not
an
easy
task
to
pack
the
tents
and
equipment
on
the
backs
of
the
horses
in
view
of
the
fact
that
each
animal
except
the
wagon
horses
must
also
carry
a
rider
the
work
was
finally
accomplished
however
each
rider
placing
a
pack
of
small
stuff
on
her
own
back
in
addition
to
the
pack
already
lashed
to
the
back
of
her
pony
before
starting
out
grace
induced
elfreda
to
remove
the
bandage
from
her
head
the
wound
was
found
to
be
healed
much
to
the
relief
of
both
ike
had
made
an
early
start
and
two
hours
later
the
overlanders
galloped
away
and
then
began
the
downward
ride
that
would
take
them
to
the
great
artificial
waterway
where
both
entertainment
and
adventure
awaited
them

up

had
met
a
deputy
sheriff
and
posse
who
had
been
in
the
mountains
looking
for
a
horse
thief
but
were
now
returning
to
the
place
for
which
the
overlanders
were
headed
from
ike
the
deputy
learned
of
the
attacks
on
the
overland
girls
and
of
their
plucky
defense
ike
furthermore
became
loquacious
told
the
officer
all
he
knew
about
grace
harlowe
and
her
friends
not
forgetting
the
redoubtable
hippy
wingate
who
had
down
more
german
airplanes
than
any
other
man
in
the
allied
when
the
deputy
reached
roosevelt
he
repeated
story
at
the
lodge
as
the
hotel
at
roosevelt
lake
was
called
so
without
their
knowledge
the
praises
were
sung
there
some
hours
in
advance
of
their
arrival
when
the
girls
came
up
with
ike
just
before
noon
that
day
and
took
luncheon
with
him
fairweather
discreetly
neglected
to
mention
what
he
had
told
the
deputy
sheriff
about
them
three
hours
later
the
overland
riders
reached
the
bottom
of
the
grade
to
roosevelt
rounded
the
that
stood
sentinel
over
the
trail
there
and
walked
their
horses
across
the
great
spillway
of

more
than
three
hundred
yards
in
length
this
spillway
releasing
the

from

in

backed
up

its
nearly
three

was
riding
by

over
and
shouted
into

ear
can
indulge
in
as
much
oratory
as
he
pleases
here
no
one
will
hear
him
above
the
roar
of
the
waterfall
for
which
much
grace
nodded
and
grinned
after
crossing
the
spillway
the
party
turned
to
the
right
and
followed
a
shining
white
trail
along
the
edge
of
the
lake
to
the
apache
lodge
which
was
located
they
found
between
the
east
and
west
arms
of
the
lake
some
difficulty
was
experienced
in
finding
a
place
where
they
could
stake
down
their
ponies
but
finally
succeeding
in
tethering
the
animals
they
quickly
removed
the
packs
from
the
backs
of
woman
and
beast
as
miss
briggs
characterized
it
if
you
do
not
mind
going
we
will
all
walk
over
to
the
lodge
and
see
if
they
will
let
us
in
said
grace
it
was
a
party
of
girls
who
mounted
the
steps
of
the
veranda
of
the
lodge
where
a
group
of
tourists
were
enjoying
the
cool
mountain
air
of
the
late
afternoon
all
eyes
were
turned
on
the
newcomers

brief
steady
look

said
grace
turning
to
the
young
women
of
her
party
it
will
be
as
well
for
you
to
wait
on
the
the
proprietor
if
he
has
any
old
hats
for
sale
suggested
hippy
wingate
as
grace
was
entering
the
lodge
at
which
there
was
an
audible
titter
from
several
of
the
women
guests
of
the
place

a
party
of
six
not
very
presentable

time
we
shall
go
into
camp
when

left
of
our
equipment
i
understand
that
you

the
clerk
there

she
wondered
to
the
clerk
she
said

reliable

horses
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to

some
one
to

some
person
who

the
clerk
said
he
would
and
that
the
rooms
for
the
party
would
be
ready
whenever
they
desired
to
take
possession
grace
returned
to
the
veranda
and
as
she
stepped
out
she
halted
and
gazed
in
amazement
elfreda
hippy
and
the
others
of
her
party
were
speaking
with
a
tall
bronzed
man
of
distinguished
appearance
with
him

a
gentleman
and
three
ladies
grace
recognized
him
of
the
distinguished
bearing
instantly
gordon

she
greeted
flushing
with
pleasure
the
general
strode
forward
and
grasped
both
her
hands

believe

which
was
a
misfortune
for
young
woman
announced
the
general
to
his
friends
but
in
a
tone
of
voice
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
most
persons
on
the
veranda
my
life
on
the
battlefield
in
the
argonne
had
it
not
been
for
her
i
should
not
be
here
i
have
already
told
gordon
the
general
begged
grace
flushing
with
embarrassment
but
the
general
went
on
unheeding
gray
dragged
me
into
a
deserted
german
nest
after
i
had
been
wounded
on
the
field
manned
a
machine
gun
and
held
the
boches
off
until
she
could
flash
morse
signals
to
our
lines
that
night
we
were
at
that
time
being
fired
upon
by
both
armies
a
braver
woman
does
not
we
speak
of
the
beauties
of
the
old
apache
trail
suggested
grace
which
brought
a
hearty
laugh
from
all
and
relieved
the
tension
under
which
she
was
suffering
i
heard
that
grace
harlowe
gray
and
her
friends
of
the
overton
unit
had
proved
themselves
the
heroines
of
the
trail
i

grace
stepped
briskly
into
the
lodge
followed
by
lieutenant
wingate
and
the
indian
during
her
absence
the
general
briefly
related
the
story
as
he
knew
it
of
the
work
of
the
overton
unit
in
france

the
man

what

gray
questioned
the
general
thank
the
overton
girls
went
to
their
rooms
not
to
appear
again
until
just
before
dinner
time
wearing
fresh
uniforms
well
groomed
eyes
sparkling
cheeks
tinged
with
faint
flushes
they
elicited
a
murmur
of
approval
from
the
tourists
as
they
stepped
out
on
the
veranda
to
join
general
gordon
and
his
party
is
served
announced
the
general
but
oh
so
different
laughingly
replied
grace
harlowe
at
the
request
one
table
had
been
set
to
accommodate
the
two
parties
and
the
dinner
proved
to
be
a
happy
occasion
for
all
at
the
suggestion
it
was
decided
that
the
two
parties
should
take
a
launch
trip
the
length
of
lake
roosevelt
on
the
following
morning
the
general
said
he
would
charter
a
launch
that
they
would
take
their
luncheons
with
them
and
have
a
real
picnic
at
the
mouth
of
tonto
creek
at
the
upper
end
of
the
lake
thirty
miles
away
a
delightful
evening
was
passed
at
the
lodge
where
grace
and
the
general
exchanged
war
reminiscences
after
which
the
girls
went
to
their
quarters
for
the
night
hippy
strolled
out
to
look
over
the
ponies
and
to
give
joe
smoky
face
final
instructions
then
returned
to
the
lodge
and
went
to
bed
the
overton
girls
were
sound
asleep
by
then
it
was
the
first
night
since
they
started
over
the
apache
trail
that
they
had
been
free
from
but
there
were
other
nights
coming
nights
that
they
felt
would
hold
a
full
measure
of
excitement
and
adventure
for
them
and
none
realized
this
possibility
better
than
did
grace
harlowe
herself

nodded
the

said
grace

launch

a
delightful
experience

our
wagon
with
most
of
our
table
ware
we
can
not
offer
you
any
luxuries
we
have
only
our
mess
kits
and
the
plates
in
them
will
barely
go
around
it
may
be
necessary
for
two
persons
to
eat
from
the
same
plate
added
grace
mischievously
we
sleep
at
the
camp
i
should
so
dearly
love
to
sleep
in
a
tent
in
the
open
declared
miss
cartwright
fear
it
will
be
too
cold
for
you
we
will
speak
of
it
later
however
after
you
have
spent
a
few
hours
in
camp
and
partaken
of
our
fare
you
may
not
wish
to
remain
over
course
you
are
desirous
of
visiting
the
ancient
homes
of
the
cliff
dwellers
up
yonder
questioned
gordon
pointing
to
the
mountains
indeed
i
hope
to
do
some
exploring
there
too
answered
grace
we
land
at
the
lodge
if
you
good
people
will
wait
on
the
veranda
for
me
i
will
run
over
to
the
camp
and
see
what
shape
we
are
in
then
call
for
you
later
suggested
grace
as
they
neared
the
landing
place
grace
and
hippy
left
their
party
at
the
lodge
pier
and
hurried
to
the
camp
are
to
have
company
for
mess
this
evening
fairweather
how
well
are
we
supplied
with
provisions
she
asked
the
old
stagecoach
driver
said
they
had
bacon
canned
beans
and
coffee
but
not
much
of
anything
else
if
you
can
purchase
something
more
at
the
lodge
especially
potatoes
did
you
find
an
indian
here
taking
care
of
the
ponies
smoky
face
as
he
called
himself
was
here
after
the
ponies
but
when
i
came
he
went
away
like
them
apaches
bad
medicine
every
one
of
is
said
to
be
trustworthy
said
grace
indians
wear
white
dress
this
redskin
dresses
like
what
he
is
an
apache
he
lives
with
his
tribe
up
the
mountain
growled
ike
worry
about
indians
interjected
lieutenant
wingate
and
more
food
is
the
burning
question
of
the
grace
directed
the
driver
to
take
one
of
the
horses
and
fetch
some
potatoes
and
some
few
other
necessaries
from
the
lodge
is
quite
probable
that
we
shall
be
here
for
a
few
days
so
nothing
in
the
way
of
food
need
be
left
behind
she
told
him
following
departure
grace
and
hippy
began
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
the
camp
blankets
were
neatly
rolled
and
placed
on
the
folding
cots
a
fancy
paper
spread
was
laid
over
the
rough
table
that
ike
had
constructed
for
them
and
paper
napkins
laid
at
each
plate
a
bunch
of
wild
asters
set
between
two
stones
to
keep
them
from
toppling
over
completed
the
table
decorations
announced
grace
surveying
the
result
of
her
labors
may
not
be
strong
on
food
but
we
have
decorations
perhaps
the
guests
may
overlook
the
mere
matter
of
food
she
added
laughingly
by
the
time
the
camp
was
in
order
ike
came
trotting
up
with
his
pack
animal
he
had
a
bushel
of
potatoes
and
some
fresh
vegetables
from
which
grace
prepared
a
salad
and
while
she
was
doing
this
ike
thrust
the
potatoes
into
hot
ashes
to
bake
young
ladies
will
be
here
to
help
to
finish
getting
the
supper
ready
fairweather
i
shall
return
at
seven
with
our
company
one
of
the
guests
is
general
gordon
a
brave
soldier
whom
i
met
on
the
battlefield
in
the
argonne
the
other
is
colonel
cartwright
another
valiant
soldier
of
the
late
war
i
thought
you
might
be
interested
in
knowing
something
about
these
men
for
they
real
like
myself
added
hippy
hippy
i
agree
with
you
there
shall
you
go
to
the
lodge
with
me
i
think
you
had
best
do
so
as
the
ladies
may
need
assistance
over
the
rough
ground
between
here
and
the
lodge
fairweather
our
guests
may
conclude
that
they
wish
to
stay
all
night
if
so
we
ladies
will
sleep
in
one
tent
giving
the
guests
the
cots
and
most
of
the
blankets
what
is
your
opinion
of
the
weather
am
of
the
same
opinion
however
the
odds
come
hippy
reaching
the
lodge
grace
directed
the
girls
to
go
to
camp
and
have
the
supper
ready
to
be
served
at
seven
sharp
telling
them
of
the
preparations
that
already
had
been
made
she
then
sat
down
to
wait
for
her
friends
who
were
still
in
their
rooms
there
were
any
number
of
persons
who
welcomed
the
opportunity
to
engage
the
overland
rider
in
conversation
which
at
once
turned
to
war
subjects
what
grace
had
to
say
about
the
war
however
did
not
concern
herself
but
had
to
do
with
general
achievements
on
the
western
front
you
please
tell
us
gray
how
you
won
the
french
war
cross
and
the
distinguished
service
medal
begged
a
lady
courteously
gordon
evidently
has
been
talking
out
of
laughed
grace
excuse
me
from
speaking
of
myself
surely
you
realize
that
it
would
be
most
embarrassing
to
me
to
speak
of
the
lady
begged
her
pardon
and
declared
that
it
was
rude
of
her
to
have
asked
the
question
grace
smiled
and
began
telling
her
questioner
of
the
work
of
the
overton
unit
and
of
lieutenant
valiant
services
in
the
army
flying
corps
this
led
to
stories
of
the
war
and
when
general
gordon
and
his
party
came
down
he
found
nearly
all
the
guests
of
the
lodge
gathered
about
the
overton
college
girl
listening
to
her
praise
not
only
of
the
overton
girls
but
of
the
young
men
of
america
who
had
fought
the
great
fight
we
late
asked
gordon
extending
her
hand
you
are
in
good
time
but
i
think
we
should
start
now
where
is
lieutenant
wingate
i
have
not
seen
him
since
we
reached
the
one
said
he
was
seen
trying
to
borrow
a
hat
from
the
chef
to
wear
to
supper
answered
a
male
voice
is
the
army
spirit
of
freedom
nodded
grace
it
is
like
lieutenant
wingate
he
lost
his
hat
on
the
way
in
and
the
wagon
that
carried
most
of
our
wearing
apparel
lies
at
the
bottom
of
a
canyon
we
will
be
going
if
you
ladies
and
gentlemen
care
to
visit
our
camp
we
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
do
so
added
grace
courteously
turning
to
the
guests
to
whom
she
had
been
telling
war
stories
comes
the
lieutenant
informed
the
man
who
had
told
grace
where
he
had
last
seen
hippy
the
lieutenant
wore
a
derby
hat
a
full
size
too
small
for
him
and
this
crowning
his
army
uniform
made
him
look
ridiculous
a
laugh
greeted
his
appearance
face
wore
a
severe
expression
he
offered
his
arm
to
miss
cartwright
with
grace
and
dignity
at
least
that
was
what
he
intended
it
to
be
but
grace
thanked
the
kind
fates
that
emma
dean
was
not
present
to
express
her
opinion
of
appearance
before
all
the
guests
of
the
hotel
you
decided
to
remain
with
us
general
asked
grace
gordon
and
myself
and
miss
cartwright
will
accept
your
hospitality
if
you
are
certain
that
we
shall
not
be
crowding
is
plenty
of
room
in
the
mountains
answered
grace
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
are
used
to
campaigning
general
but
i
hope
the
ladies
will
not
regret
their
they
assured
grace
that
they
would
not
so
the
party
started
out
full
of
anticipation
for
the
new
experience
that
lay
before
them
the
general
when
they
reached
the
camp
turned
to
grace
with
eyes
twinkling
would
know
even
did
i
not
know
that
this
was
your
camp
that
some
one
who
had
been
with
the
forces
had
laid
it
out
he
said
fairweather
our
driver
laid
it
out
answered
grace
mischievously
is
an
apt
pupil
returned
the
general
win
general
laughed
grace
this
delightful
cried
miss
cartwright
look
at
the
table
pardon
my
ill
manners
but
this
is
so
different
from
what
i
expected
to
find
in
in
a
traveling
circus
finished
emma
amid
laughter
the
worst
is
yet
to
come
observed
hippy
grace
introduced
fairweather
to
their
guests
who
shook
hands
cordially
with
the
old
stagecoach
driver
the
potatoes
done
whispered
grace
ike
nodded
odors
of
frying
bacon
and
the
aroma
of
coffee
were
in
the
air
and
when
grace
announced
that
the
guests
were
to
be
seated
the
summons
was
quickly
answered
grace
had
brought
a
pound
of
butter
with
her
from
the
lodge
a
luxury
that
the
overland
girls
themselves
had
not
enjoyed
since
the
first
day
out
from
globe
had
such
an
appetite
since
i
left
france
declared
the
general
you
have
not
had
so
much
exercise
and
fresh
air
in
any
one
day
since
then
suggested
elfreda
that
explains
it
replied
the
officer
dryly
the
supper
went
along
merrily
the
stock
of
bacon
being
considerably
depleted
when
finally
the
guests
refused
another
helping
and
at
invitation
rose
and
strolled
over
to
the
cheerful
campfire
where
they
sat
down
the
men
to
smoke
their
pipes
and
the
women
to
chat
it
was
ten
when
colonel
cartwright
said
he
must
be
getting
back
to
the
lodge
he
added
that
there
was
dancing
there
and
invited
the
overland
girls
to
go
over
and
dance
but
grace
declined
for
her
party
saying
that
they
had
a
strenuous
day
ahead
of
them
as
they
wished
to
explore
the
cliff
homes
on
the
morrow
grace
had
further
plans
in
mind
regarding
the
explorations
but
she
said
nothing
to
her
guests
about
it
said
grace
calling
the
officer
aside
before
the
colonel
and
his
wife
took
their
leave
looks
like
a
storm
i
wish
you
and
gordon
to
remain
if
you
desire
to
do
so
but
we
may
have
a
wet
time
of
old
campaigner
like
myself
mind
a
little
thing
like
a
wetting
you
should
know
am
not
thinking
of
you
but
of
gordon
and
miss
good
scouts
answered
the
general
fare
will
be
yours
then
sir
colonel
and
cartwright
we
shall
be
happy
to
have
you
join
us
for
mess
at
any
before
leaving
the
colonel
invited
the
overland
girls
to
have
dinner
with
him
at
the
lodge
on
the
following
evening
and
remain
for
the
dance
grace
said
they
could
not
think
of
it
so
far
as
the
dinner
was
concerned
but
that
if
they
were
not
too
tired
they
would
go
over
for
the
dance
the
gordons
and
miss
cartwright
resumed
their
positions
by
the
campfire
after
the
colonel
and
his
wife
escorted
by
hippy
still
wearing
his
derby
hat
started
towards
the
lodge
the
fire
was
blazing
up
cheerfully
and
before
it
the
girls
of
the
overton
unit
sat
and
talked
with
the
guests
of
their
campaigning
days
in
france
something
whistled
down
from
the
air
and
every
person
in
the
outfit
heard
the
thud
when
it
struck
the
ground
stone
from
the
mountain
said
the
general
think
not
replied
grace
getting
up
fell
right
near
where
called
ike
fairweather
as
grace
began
looking
about
her
alertly
like
a
i
see
grace
sprang
forward
followed
by
general
gordon
and
with
her
pocket
lamp
examined
the
object
that
had
so
mysteriously
fallen
among
them
arrow
exclaimed
the
general
a
spent
arrow
from
the
indian
indian
camp
is
too
far
away
for
that
sir
replied
grace
it
gray
questioned
the
officer
stooping
over
to
pluck
the
missile
from
the
ground
warned
the
overton
girl
she
examined
the
arrow
as
it
stood
doubled
over
at
the
break
which
was
about
midway
of
the
shaft
then
withdrew
the
point
and
carried
the
whole
to
the
campfire
for
further
examination
chapter
xxi
a
night
of
thrills
after
a
careful
scrutiny
of
the
arrow
grace
glanced
up
at
the
general
who
was
regarding
her
inquiringly
do
you
find
he
asked
the
arrow
has
been
weakened
in
the
middle
by
a
cut
with
a
knife
it
appears
to
have
been
the
intention
of
the
person
who
shot
it
that
it
should
break
on
striking
the
ground
you
can
see
that
the
cut
is
a
fresh
one
probably
made
only
a
little
while
so
i
observe
what
does
that
signify
am
not
well
posted
on
indian
lore
but
i
do
know
that
with
the
chinese
a
broken
stick
or
twig
cast
before
one
is
a
warning
fairweather
will
you
please
come
here
ike
stepped
over
and
stood
frowningly
regarding
the
shaft
that
grace
was
holding
up
for
his
inspection
is
an
indian
arrow
is
it
not
fairweather
she
asked
does
it
mean
when
an
indian
shoots
an
arrow
with
such
a
break
as
this
in
it
answered
the
stagecoach
driver
without
hesitation
a
warning
it
must
have
come
from
an
indian
who
feels
kindly
toward
us
what
i
do
not
understand
is
why
if
he
wished
to
give
us
warning
of
something
he
did
not
come
to
us
with
is
queer
critters
observed
ike
wisely
no
for
indians
and
think
i
agree
with
you
answered
grace
rewarding
the
old
man
with
a
smile
see
to
it
that
the
ponies
are
well
staked
nothing
more
after
the
driver
had
walked
away
grace
leaned
back
and
laughed
have
a
feeling
general
that
before
this
night
ends
you
will
be
wishing
that
you
had
remained
at
the
lodge
chuckled
grace
no
nothing
like
that
gray
i
should
enjoy
a
little
excitement
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
the
armistice
was
signed
and
with
it
the
real
joy
of
trying
to
live
i
agree
with
excusing
herself
as
hippy
came
up
and
sat
down
to
chat
with
the
general
while
the
girls
were
entertaining
gordon
and
miss
cartwright
grace
walked
over
to
ike
who
was
restaking
the
horses
hope
to
do
some
mountain
climbing
and
if
we
do
so
i
shall
require
several
hundred
feet
of
light
strong
rope
please
see
if
you
can
get
it
for
me
what
do
you
think
asked
grace
nodding
toward
the
sky
squall
i
than
a
squall
i
should
say
however
you
know
more
about
the
mountain
weather
than
i
do
and
confidentially
fairweather
that
broken
arrow
leads
me
to
believe
that
it
would
be
good
judgment
for
you
to
take
a
rifle
to
bed
with
you
suggested
grace
ike
grinned
and
nodded
returning
to
her
guests
grace
suggested
to
them
that
it
might
be
well
to
turn
in
as
a
busy
day
was
before
them
for
the
morrow
you
and
the
lieutenant
will
occupy
the
small
tent
to
the
right
the
ladies
will
take
the
middle
one
and
we
girls
will
occupy
the
large
outside
tent
i
hope
you
will
sleep
well
lieutenant
please
show
the
general
to
his
sleeping
half
an
hour
later
the
overland
girls
were
chattering
in
low
tones
in
their
own
tent
hippy
and
the
general
were
already
snoring
in
theirs
while
the
two
women
guests
were
having
some
difficulty
in
getting
to
sleep
in
their
strange
surroundings
grace
had
thrown
herself
down
on
her
cot
where
she
lay
pondering
on
the
mystery
of
the
broken
arrow
after
half
an
hour
of
this
she
got
up
to
have
a
look
at
the
weather
before
turning
in
for
the
night
observing
that
the
campfire
fanned
by
a
breeze
from
the
mountains
was
flickering
and
snapping
as
if
in
protest
at
being
disturbed
shading
her
eyes
with
a
hand
and
gazing
up
to
the
mountains
grace
saw
dark
clouds
swirling
about
the
four
peaks
in
the
distance
and
heard
a
far
away
roar
of
thunder
a
dull
red
flash
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
range
of
mountains
reminded
her
of
flashes
from
the
big
guns
on
the
battle
front
think
we
are
going
to
catch
it
observed
the
overland
girl
it
be
that
the
arrow
was
a
storm
warning
grace
dismissed
the
thought
as
improbable
and
returning
to
her
tent
laid
aside
her
clothes
and
got
into
bed
she
was
awakened
some
two
hours
later
by
tremendous
gusts
of
wind
accompanied
by
flapping
canvas
and
a
heavy
downpour
of
rain
lightning
flashes
were
outlining
the
black
clouds
and
crashes
of
thunder
reverberated
from
peak
to
peak
seeming
finally
to
lose
themselves
in
the
black
depths
of
the
canyons
grace
got
up
and
dressed
and
putting
on
her
slicker
stepped
out
the
raindrops
beat
on
her
face
stinging
like
tiny
hailstones
the
ponies
were
whinneying
and
rearing
so
grace
stepped
over
and
tried
to
quiet
them
and
there
ike
fairweather
found
her
as
she
stood
revealed
when
a
flash
of
lightning
deluged
the
camp
with
a
blinding
light
you
gray
he
called
uncertain
just
which
one
of
the
outfit
it
was
that
he
saw
grace
had
to
shout
to
make
herself
heard
above
the
roar
of
the
gale
is
the
lieutenant
think
the
tents
will
hold
questioned
ike
anxiously
hope
so
please
look
after
the
horses
i
will
rout
out
the
lieutenant
and
see
what
we
can
do
to
keep
the
tents
down
especially
the
one
occupied
by
general
wife
and
grace
ran
back
and
called
hippy
the
general
heard
the
call
and
answered
first
storm
sir
grace
informed
him
please
hurry
out
i
need
at
is
it
is
jerry

answered
hippy
wingate
sleepily
the
general
laughed
is
bad
it
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
gray
he
asked
must
try
to
hold
down
tent
but
i
fear
we
shall
lose
some
of
our
goes
one
already
cried
the
general
as
the
tent
he
and
lieutenant
wingate
had
occupied
puffed
out
like
a
balloon
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
the
lieutenant
made
no
effort
to
recover
it
but
ran
calling
to
grace
to
know
where
she
was
on
the
stakes
hold
the
tent
down
at
all
hazards
she
cried
elfreda
had
taken
charge
of
the
tent
occupied
by
the
overland
girls
and
was
hurrying
her
companions
with
their
dressing
they
had
barely
finished
dressing
when
the
tent
pulled
its
stakes
and
toppled
over
it
let
it
get
away
shouted
miss
briggs
was
that
cried
general
gordon
when
during
a
brief
lull
in
the
storm
his
ears
caught
a
familiar
whistling
sound
bullet
sir
answered
grace
promptly
out
for
the
next
gust
of
wind
going
to
be
a
severe
they
come
again
exclaimed
the
general
as
bullets
began
spraying
the
camp
grace
sprang
to
the
tent
occupied
by
gordon
which
hippy
was
doing
his
best
to
hold
down
flat
on
the
ground
gordon
she
shouted
under
at
about
the
same
instant
elfreda
briggs
was
uttering
a
similar
warning
to
the
girls
in
her
charge
the
grew
hotter
continued
so
for
a
few
moments
then
suddenly
ceased
as
a
fresh
blast
of
storm
swept
down
on
the
camp
from
the
mountains
and
then
despite
all
their
efforts
the
tent
that
grace
and
the
two
men
were
now
holding
gave
way
under
the
tremendous
power
of
the
wind
gordon
and
miss
cartwright
while
thoroughly
frightened
were
too
plucky
to
make
any
outcry
and
after
a
few
moments
of
lively
work
the
general
and
hippy
with
some
assistance
from
grace
succeeded
in
saving
the
tent
about
that
time
the
rain
dwindled
to
a
sprinkle
and
bullets
again
began
to
spatter
about
the
camp
uttering
an
exclamation
grace
ran
for
her
rifle
which
she
thrust
into
hippy
hand
grace
pointed
up
at
a
spot
on
the
mountains
closely
and
you
will
see
the
flashes
of
the
rifles
that
are
shooting
at
us
every
time
you
see
a
flash
shoot
at
it
hippy
located
the
flashes
instantly
and
began
firing
at
them
grace
observing
and
offering
suggestions
is
he
shooting
at
questioned
the
general
the
flashes
of
the
guns
up
yonder
on
the
mountain
if
your
eye
is
quick
enough
you
can
see
general
gordon
who
had
reassured
gordon
and
her
companion
by
telling
them
that
the
storm
had
about
blown
itself
out
at
the
same
time
cautioning
both
to
keep
down
close
to
the
ground
so
long
as
the
shooting
lasted
watched
lieutenant
work
with
the
rifle
with
interest
after
hippy
had
twice
emptied
the
magazine
of
the
rifle
the
fog
clouds
blotted
out
the
peaks
of
the
mountains
and
slowly
settled
down
drawing
a
mantle
over
the
point
from
which
the
bullets
had
been
coming
whereupon
the
fire
from
the
mountains
ceased
and
lieutenant
wingate
laid
down
his
rifle
hope
that
ends
it
for
said
grace
think
the
fog
will
hold
pretty
much
as
it
is
so
the
next
thing
is
a
campfire
if
we
can
find
enough
fuel
to
start
ike
was
already
engaged
in
this
task
general
gordon
in
the
meantime
was
assisting
gordon
and
miss
cartwright
over
to
the
fire
which
ike
was
fanning
into
life
with
his
sombrero
am
so
sorry
gordon
sympathized
grace
as
the
wife
began
shaking
out
her
wet
wrinkled
skirt
gordon
laughed
am
quite
willing
to
suffer
such
slight
discomfort
for
the
privilege
of
seeing
this
outfit
at
work
in
an
emergency
she
declared
grace
suggested
to
the
general
that
it
might
be
advisable
to
take
the
ladies
back
to
the
lodge
for
the
rest
of
the
night
no
no
protested
miss
cartwright
for
one

to
see
it
do
i
approved
gordon
elfreda
who
had
found
the
makings
was
brewing
tea
over
the
fire
and
anne
was
toasting
crackers
on
the
other
side
of
it
bullets
then
tea
and
crackers
this
romantic
cried
miss
cartwright
young
ladies
surely
do
know
how
to
do
the
warmth
of
the
campfire
and
the
refreshments
put
new
spirits
into
the
party
and
they
were
now
able
to
laugh
over
their
plight
the
guests
however
were
at
a
loss
to
understand
why
any
one
should
wish
to
shoot
at
the
camp
of
the
overland
riders
can
not
comprehend
how
they
were
able
to
place
their
bullets
right
in
the
camp
in
all
that
darkness
and
storm
wondered
gordon
rifles
undoubtedly
were
aimed
and
set
before
dark
answered
lieutenant

broken

general
reminded
grace

mused
the
veteran
the
rest
of
the
night
was
passed
by
the
campers
with
some
discomfort
but
without
further
disturbance
the
tops
of
the
mountains
being
hidden
from
sight
by
the
cloud
fog
until
the
morning
sun
cleared
away
the
mists
when
a
glorious
day
was
in

explorations
girls
cried
elfreda
next
morning
shall
have
to
do
our
family
washing
and
ironing
this
we
do
i
know
of
one
who
will
have
to
stay
in
bed
during
the
process
piped
emma
been
able
to
find
my
everyday
skirt
and
i
suppose
that
too
has
been
blown
off
into
the
canyon
perhaps
to
keep
my
black
silk
soon
after
breakfast
colonel
and
cartwright
came
over
they
having
been
much
concerned
for
their
friends
upon
learning
that
a
severe
mountain
storm
had
swept
the
valley
in
the
night
the
colonel
urged
all
hands
to
have
dinner
with
him
at
the
lodge
but
the
girls
declined
saying
that
they
had
work
for
every
minute
of
the
day
so
their
guests
left
after
obtaining
a
promise
from
grace
that
she
and
her
friends
would
attend
the
dance
at
the
lodge
that
evening
have
an
idea
and
i
shall
try
to
put
it
to
the
test
murmured
grace
using
her
glasses
in
a
long
searching
study
of
the
mountains
to
the
rear
of
the
camp
it
was
a
hard
work
that
the
overland
girls
did
but
when
night
came
they
were
ready
for
the
entertainment
at
the
lodge
and
were
as
well
groomed
as
though
they
had
but
just
come
from
their
own
dressing
rooms
at
home
do
not
know
how
you
do
it
it
is
wonderful
exclaimed
miss
cartwright
in
greeting
to
the
overlanders
upon
their
arrival
at
the
lodge
the
dance
lasted
until
half
after
eleven
and
the
girls
declared
that
they
had
not
had
such
a
delightful
evening
since
their
last
hop
at
overton
college
out
and
get
shotted
with
us
urged
emma
dean
as
they
were
about
to
take
their
departure
for
the
camp
that
night
the
overland
party
was
treated
to
another
deluge
of
bullets
but
the
firing
did
no
damage
beyond
putting
a
hole
through
the
occupied
by
ike
fairweather
all
hands
despite
their
loss
of
sleep
were
up
early
on
the
following
morning
making
preparation
for
their
journey
to
the
homes
of
the
ancient
cliff
dwellers
where
an
exciting
day
awaited
them
chapter
xxii
relics
of
an
ancient
race
the
gordons
and
cartwrights
had
engaged
a
conveyance
to
take
them
to
the
point
on
the
apache
trail
where
they
must
turn
off
and
walk
about
a
mile
to
reach
the
homes
of
the
cliff
dwellers
the
overland
riders
preferred
to
ride
their
ponies
ike
taking
his
team
to
carry
himself
and
the
rations
for
the
day
tucked
away
with
the
equipment
was
a
strong
rope
several
hundred
feet
in
length
ike
at
request
having
provided
this
and
other
equipment
without
asking
too
many
questions
an
early
start
was
made
both
parties
reaching
the
place
at
about
the
same
time
and
shortly
thereafter
a
merry
company
carrying
picnic
baskets
was
ascending
the
steep
narrow
trail
that
led
to
the
tonto
cliff
dwellings
they
found
the
first
of
the
two
main
groups
of
prehistoric
community
dwellings
free
of
tourists
and
the
overton
college
girls
stood
in
awe
as
they
gazed
on
the
massive
masonry
of
this
relic
of
an
unknown
past
you
familiar
with
the
history
of
these
cliff
dwellings
gray
asked
the
general
must
confess
that
i
am
not
wholly
familiar
with
the
subject
sir
will
you
tell
us
what
you
know
about
them
one
knows
of
their
beginning
nor
of
the
people
who
inhabited
them
we
do
know
that
scouts
discovered
them
nearly
four
hundred
years
ago
the
coronado
scouts
it
is
said
believed
that
they
found
the
frontier
fortresses
of
that
rich
kingdom
of
tontonteac
which
was
one
of
the
seven
they
dwellings
were
not
then
occupied
were
they
asked
anne
no
responded
the
general
were
in
ruins
as
you
see
them
now
so
you
can
form
some
idea
of
the
antiquity
of
the
you
know
whether
or
not
the
cliff
dwellers
were
here
ahead
of
the
indians
sir
asked
grace
is
supposed
that
they
were
for
the
indians
of
the
present
day
do
not
even
know
of
them
in
legend
the
dwellers
must
have
had
enemies
man
or
beast
for
you
see
they
built
their
castles
in
spots
they
builded
them
well
too
high
under
leaning
walls
of
rock
of
blocked
stone
set
with
strong
adobe
mortar
they
were
architects
and
they
were
builders
were
those
ancients
declared
the
general
peculiar
feature
of
their
homes
is
that
each
community
lived
in
a
community
house
said
to
have
included
sixty
to
seventy
rooms
the
three
dwellings
that
are
accessible
do
not
show
what
the
inner
arrangements
were
but
a
fourth
one
that
has
never
been
explored
is
believed
to
be
in
a
better
state
of
is
the
one
i
propose
to
have
a
look
at
declared
grace
suspected
as
much
nodded
the
general
try
it
is
my
advice
you
know
what
kind
of
a
precipice
one
would
have
to
pass
over
to
get
know
the
precipice
for
i
have
examined
it
through
my
glasses
but
i
am
not
convinced
that
there
is
no
other
entrance
to
the
makes
you
think
that
formation
of
the
sheer
wall
that
falls
away
from
their
front
dooryard
shows
that
it
has
been
in
that
same
condition
for
perhaps
thousands
of
years
and
probably
was
in
the
same
condition
in
the
days
of
the
cliff
dwellers
suppose
we
have
our
luncheon
here
and
then
have
a
look
at
the
top
of
this
unknown
cliff
all
through
the
luncheon
that
was
eaten
in
an
ancient
community
house
with
the
magnificent
view
of
mountain
and
canyon
spread
out
before
them
general
gordon
was
regarding
grace
perplexedly
believe
she
really
intends
to
try
it
he
muttered
i
do
not
know
she
does
though
and
i
have
no
doubt
the
plan
is
already
clearly
outlined
under
that
head
of
fair
brown
you
do
not
believe
i
can
do
it
eh
chided
grace
favoring
the
officer
with
a
brilliant
smile
not
believe
gray
are
you
a
mind
reader
demanded
the
general
a
mental
process
is
reflected
in
a
face
as
it
has
been
in
yours
for
the
last
five
minutes
the
reading
is
the
general
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
true
french
form
give
up
he
exclaimed
wish
the
walls
of
this
ancient
place
might
be
read
as
easily
added
grace
you
think
the
ladies
can
stand
a
climb
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
yes
it
is
not
a
long
nor
a
very
hard
climb
i
should
judge
from
the
looks
of
it
replied
the
general
it
was
decided
to
leave
the
hampers
at
the
lunching
place
but
to
carry
their
mess
kits
grace
told
ike
fairweather
to
take
the
rope
with
him
as
it
might
be
needed
in
her
own
kit
she
carried
a
ball
of
stout
twine
ammunition
for
her
rifle
and
for
the
automatic
that
swung
in
its
holster
is
ready
please
take
your
time
ladies
and
if
you
tire
you
must
say
so
she
directed
follow
where
you
lead
gray
promised
miss
cartwright
dramatically
make
rash
promises
miss
cartwright
warned
the
general
know
what
you
are
promising
i
think
wait
and
see
teased
the
young
woman
it
was
a
hard
hike
to
the
brow
of
the
mountain
taking
nearly
two
hours
at
the
rate
they
traveled
the
party
finally
came
out
on
a
broad
table
of
rock
from
which
the
mountain
sloped
away
a
short
distance
then
took
a
sheer
drop
of
a
thousand
feet
none
of
the
party
ventured
to
look
over
the
brink
until
grace
finally
did
so
then
turned
laughingly
to
miss
cartwright
you
following
miss
cartwright
stepped
up
beside
grace
and
gazed
off
over
the
great
precipice
illustration
grace
disappeared
over
the
edge
suddenly
the
army
sister
swayed
dizzily
and
had
grace
lost
her
head
for
a
second
a
disaster
probably
would
have
resulted
arm
quickly
encircled
the
waist
of
miss
cartwright
and
drew
her
back
now
in
a
fainting
condition
the
dizzy
height
had
been
too
much
for
the
young
nerves
grace
gravely
handed
her
over
to
colonel
cartwright
am
sorry
sir
that
i
encouraged
her
it
was
not
prudent
of
me
at
all
she
said
grace
after
studying
the
face
of
the
cliff
for
a
few
moments
stepped
back
and
spoke
to
ike
fairweather
pointing
to
a
projecting
tower
of
rock
that
crowned
the
tableland
like
a
monument
can
snub
the
rope
around
that
she
said
gray
surely
you
are
not
going
to
try
that
desperate
descent
begged
general
gordon
is
the
word
general
if
you
think
it
advisable
take
gordon
and
miss
cartwright
for
a
walk
to
see
me
go
over
may
upset
them
the
descent
is
perfectly
safe
provided
the
rope
break
i
have
my
reasons
other
than
mere
curiosity
for
attempting
to
get
to
the
community
house
down
good
gray
depend
upon
me
for
whatever
i
may
be
able
to
do
i
think
i
understand
your
real
motive
do
not
worry
about
the
ladies
if
they
can
not
stand
it
to
see
you
go
over
they
can
turn
their
backs
on
preparations
were
quickly
made
miss
cartwright
observing
and
a
little
pale
ike
had
made
a
sling
with
a
board
bottom
for
grace
to
sit
in
in
addition
to
this
she
slipped
a
loop
of
the
rope
under
her
shoulders
grace
then
produced
the
ball
of
strong
twine
from
her
kit
and
made
an
end
fast
to
the
she
directed
that
some
one
keep
hold
of
the
twine
at
all
times
for
signals
pull
will
mean
that
i
have
a
message
to
send
up
two
pulls
will
advise
you
that
i
am
to
be
hauled
up
grace
informed
them
you
ready
announced
the
four
men
in
chorus
general
gordon
added
that
he
would
stand
at
the
upper
edge
of
the
slope
and
watch
grace
over
its
lower
edge
from
which
point
she
would
have
a
sheer
drop
of
what
he
estimated
to
be
about
three
hundred
feet
to
the
cliff
dwelling
do
be
careful
admonished
elfreda
anxiously
know
there
is
no
use
trying
to
dissuade
you
from
attempting
this
foolish
thing
so
we
can
do
nothing
except
to
wish
you
you
can
you
can
hold
fast
to
the
rope
corrected
grace
smiling
and
nodding
to
her
companions
she
took
a
final
look
about
then
crept
cautiously
down
to
the
edge
of
the
slope
where
the
sheer
drop
began
waved
a
hand
and
disappeared
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
chapter
xxiii
between
earth
and
sky
before
starting
on
her
perilous
venture
grace
had
directed
that
the
rope
be
paid
out
slowly
so
as
not
to
set
up
so
much
friction
that
the
rope
would
be
in
danger
of
burning
as
she
went
over
grace
took
one
look
below
her
and
closed
her
eyes
but
after
a
few
moments
she
summoned
her
courage
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
down
she
could
see
directly
beneath
her
the
ledge
under
which
the
cliff
community
house
had
been
constructed
out
in
front
of
the
ledge
were
the
white
stone
walls
and
part
of
the
roof
of
the
ancient
structure
which
she
was
on
her
way
to
explore
down
is
easy
it
is
getting
back
that
is
going
to
be
the
big
problem
muttered
the
plucky
girl
is
worth
the
risk
think
of
it
grace
harlowe
you
possibly
will
be
the
first
human
being
to
set
foot
on
that
shelf
of
rock
in
ten
centuries
perhaps
ten
times
ten
grace
wriggled
and
twisted
herself
into
position
for
a
suitable
landing
and
as
it
was
she
grazed
the
wall
of
the
cliff
dwelling
slipping
down
the
side
of
it
kicking
out
vigorously
to
keep
from
tearing
her
clothing
on
the
protruding
points
of
stone
until
her
feet
touched
the
ground
harlowe
luck
is
with
me
thus
grace
hastily
penciled
a
note
reading
safely
send
the
string
back
with
a
small
stone
to
weight
it
fine
view
down
here
i
start
exploring
worry
if
you
hear
from
me
for
an
hour
or
one
tug
on
the
line
and
the
overton
girl
was
rewarded
by
seeing
her
message
slowly
rising
at
the
end
of
the
twine
grace
thereupon
took
account
of
her
surroundings
with
her
glass
she
picked
up
the
lodge
then
the
tiny
dots
that
she
knew
were
the
overland
tents
it
was
a
clear
view
to
the
camp
and
as
grace
described
it
to
herself
a
good
shooting
range
now
began
her
explorations
there
were
heaps
of
rotted
stone
and
adobe
mortar
all
about
but
taking
it
all
in
all
the
community
house
appeared
to
be
in
an
excellent
state
of
preservation
grace
took
her
time
and
moved
slowly
using
extreme
caution
not
knowing
what
emergency
she
might
have
to
meet
at
any
moment
over
heaps
of
stone
and
rubbish
she
climbed
to
such
chambers
as
she
could
reach
the
ceilings
in
the
community
house
were
so
low
that
she
was
obliged
to
stoop
window
apertures
were
no
more
than
six
inches
across
and
of
equal
height
but
the
light
shed
by
these
was
sufficient
to
enable
her
to
pick
her
way
about
the
mustiness
of
centuries
hung
heavy
on
the
air
despite
the
ventilation
and
birds
disturbed
by
her
entrance
gave
grace
a
start
as
they
winged
their
way
toward
the
light
not
a
relic
however
did
the
overton
girl
find
in
her
search
of
the
chambers
on
coming
out
of
the
cliff
dwelling
grace
suddenly
halted
and
sniffed
the
air
smells
like
a
dead
fire
she
muttered
i
have
company
picking
her
way
cautiously
in
under
the
ledge
that
formed
a
partial
roof
for
the
ancient
community
house
grace
found
herself
in
a
vast
opening
black
darkness
lay
ahead
of
her
but
the
odor
of
a
dead
fire
grew
stronger
in
her
nostrils
as
she
proceeded
grace
now
brought
her
flash
lamp
from
her
pocket
passing
it
to
her
left
hand
and
holding
the
automatic
in
a
firm
grip
in
her
right
she
advanced
prepared
for
emergencies
she
examined
the
walls
briefly
from
their
smoothness
it
occurred
to
grace
that
water
had
once
flowed
through
the
tunnel
how
far
back
the
tunnel
led
into
the
mountain
she
could
not
even
guess
but
it
was
reasonable
to
suppose
that
it
was
not
a
waterway
when
the
cliff
dwellers
lived
there
am
getting
near
it
the
dead
fire
odor
is
growing
stronger
grace
told
herself
in
a
whisper
believe
my
surmises
are
correct
how
i
wish
one
of
the
men
were
with
me
however
in
it
and
must
go
through
with
it
she
muttered
using
her
flash
lamp
to
guard
against
stepping
into
a
pitfall
the
overton
girl
picked
her
way
cautiously
along
here
and
there
were
huge
crevices
in
the
wall
of
the
tunnel
which
as
grace
described
it
to
herself
was
in
reality
rear
yard
of
the
ancient
cliff
the
crevices
as
she
shot
rays
of
light
into
them
were
dark
and
forbidding
but
looking
back
the
white
towers
of
the
community
house
stood
out
reassuringly
grace
had
stepped
into
a
heap
of
ashes
and
they
felt
warm
under
her
feet
stooping
over
and
running
her
hand
into
the
mass
she
found
that
the
ashes
at
the
bottom
really
were
warm
has
been
a
recent
fire
here
but
the
ashes
are
several
hours
old
i
wish
tom
were
here
he
could
tell
me
within
half
an
hour
just
how
long
ago
this
heap
was
a
blazing
fire
let
me
reason
this
grace
leaned
against
the
wall
and
reflected
one
has
been
in
this
place
within
a
dozen
hours
or
so
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
too
that
they
did
not
come
over
the
precipice
hence
there
must
be
some
other
entrance
some
other
way
and
perhaps
an
easier
one
i
am
going
grace
started
ahead
resolutely
now
and
then
flashing
a
ribbon
of
light
to
the
floor
directly
ahead
of
her
her
keenness
was
rewarded
a
few
moments
later
and
the
overton
girl
dropping
to
her
knees
examined
the
rocky
floor
with
great
care
what
grace
had
discovered
was
the
imprint
of
a
boot
faint
but
clearly
defined
her
next
discovery
was
a
frying
pan
some
tin
plates
and
a
heap
of
bones
that
looked
as
if
they
might
be
beef
bones
surely
live
well
up
here
i
grace
jumped
that
is
her
nerves
did
her
body
did
not
move
at
all
but
she
heard
her
heart
beat
and
it
was
pounding
fast
and
hard
what
had
disturbed
and
startled
her
was
a
groan
a
distinctly
human
groan
and
then
deep
silence
settled
over
the
tunnel
broken
only
by
the
faint
repressed
breathing
of
grace
herself
the
natural
impulse
was
to
turn
on
her
light
but
grace
harlowe
was
too
prudent
to
do
that
just
yet
she
preferred
to
wait
and
listen
this
policy
produced
results
a
second
groan
more
prolonged
than
before
followed
it
was
a
human
groan
of
distress
that
she
had
heard
though
whether
real
or
feigned
the
girl
was
unable
to
decide
in
her
own
mind
but
she
now
realized
that
she
must
make
the
advance
herself
arriving
at
this
decision
grace
turned
on
her
light
and
with
the
automatic
revolver
thrust
ahead
of
her
ready
for
instant
use
she
began
a
cautious
search
for
the
source
of
the
voice
again
so
i
may
know
where
you
are
she
called
softly
you
are
hoping
to
play
a
trick
on
me
i
shall
shoot
on
sight
the
response
came
back
almost
at
once
the
voice
sounding
ahead
of
her
and
to
the
right
side
of
the
tunnel
she
moved
forward
with
renewed
caution
and
a
few
steps
further
on
as
she
flashed
her
ribbon
of
light
into
a
niche
in
the
wall
of
the
tunnel
she
saw
him
grace
approached
cautiously
still
holding
her
weapon
at
ready
for
though
she
was
looking
down
on
a
man
apparently
hound
and
gagged
she
proposed
to
take
no
more
than
the
absolutely
necessary
chances
leaning
over
with
the
revolver
pointed
down
at
him
grace
turned
the
light
of
her
lamp
into
the
face
of
the
owner
of
the
voice
as
she
did
so
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
amazement
chapter

grace
solves
the

mystery
smoky
face
cried
grace
harlowe
does
this
mean
kill
um
raged
the
indian
who
had
guarded
their
ponies
on
the
night
of
the
overland
arrival
after
grace
had
removed
the
gag
from
his

freed

did
you
shoot
that
arrow
into
our
camp
to
warn
us
demanded
grace
a
sudden
light
flooding
her
mentality
shoot
joe
ran
down
the
tunnel
a
few
yards
and
returned
with
two
rifles
both
loaded
we
are
all
right
if
you
are
certain
that
no
one
will
come
here
tell
me
as
quickly
as
you
can
what
happened
to
from
the
monosyllables
and
using
her
imagination
freely
grace
inferred
that
joe
had
overheard
the
bandits
when
they
were
spying
on
the
overland
camp
and
after
the
men
had
gone
away
as
joe
supposed
he
had
fired
the
arrow
into
the
camp
to
warn
grace
harlowe
and
her
friends
the
bandits
however
had
not
gone
away
and
when
they
saw
what
joe
had
done
they
suddenly
fell
upon
him
bound
and
gagged
him
and
carried
him
to
their
lair
in
the
ancient
community
house
of
the
cliff
dwellers
con
bates
one
of
those
men
she
asked
come
is
ben
jackson
man
who
follow
white
girls
till
bates
make
escape
at
globe
and
come
along
to
help
much
bad
men
steal
much
plenty
here
you
find
joe
smoky
face
know
say
they
have
gone
to

con

would
not
dare
to
go
there
how

he
get

mebby
he
not

ben

he
go
mebby
con
he
stay

joe
counted
six
on
his
fingers
me
the
way
out
demanded
grace
in
mountain
joe
show
joe
show
other
the
indian
did
he
led
the
overton
girl
into
dark
recesses
in
the
wall
of
the
tunnel
where
by
the
light
of
her
lamp
she
saw
plunder
that
made
her
eyes
widen
it
was
mostly
small
merchandise
but
valuable
there
were
gold
and
silver
articles
and
some
precious
stones
but
not
many
that
grace
in
her
hasty
examination
thought
were
of
considerable
value
in
another
cache
there
were
silks
carefully
wrapped
and
a
regular
arsenal
of
rifles
revolvers
and
ammunition
all
probably
stolen
grace
eyes
glowed
those
men
here
last
night
i
mean
did
they
shoot
from
out
there
pointing
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
of
the
cliff
dwellers
shoot
at
white
thought
so
when
i
saw
the
flashes
from
their
rifles
and
this
morning
looked
at
this
place
with
my
glasses
i
made
up
my
mind
that
the
shots
had
been
fired
from
here
joe
we
must
catch
these
men
every
one
of
them
do
you
think
you
can
get
back
to
your
people
without
being
seen
provided
any
of
the
bandits
should
still
be
about
your
camp
get
good
go
back
to
your
camp
on
the
mountain
side
and
send
a
trustworthy
indian
to
get
the
sheriff
i
will
send
a
letter
by
you
to
the
clerk
at
the
lodge
and
he
can
telephone
for
the
sheriff
when
the
sheriff
and
his
party
are
found
have
them
led
here
but
do
not
try
to
get
here
until
dark
do
the
bandits
keep
a
guard
on
the
outside
of
this
place
at
night
not
the
indian
was
trotting
ahead
grace
lighting
the
way
with
her
lamp
she
observed
that
the
instinct
of
the
indian
enabled
him
to
follow
the
outward
trail
with
as
little
difficulty
as
if
he
had
been
over
it
many
times
end
now
finally
announced
joe
the
trail
having
narrowed
down
so
that
they
were
obliged
to
go
in
single
file
it
was
dark
as
night
where
they
were
but
joe
knew
how
to
reach
the
light
she
saw
him
put
a
shoulder
to
the
low
roof
and
lift
from
a
narrow
opening
a
slab
of
rock
which
he
cautiously
shoved
an
inch
or
so
to
one
side
and
for
several
minutes
stood
with
eyes
at
the
crack
he
had
made
gone
said
joe
pushing
the
slab
of
rock
aside
following
her
guide
grace
crawled
out
and
looked
about
her
the
opening
through
which
she
had
emerged
was
on
the
sloping
side
of
the
mountain
well
screened
by
cactus
the
indian
replaced
the
slab
of
stone
which
then
looked
to
be
a
part
of
the
cavern
wall
simple
muttered
grace
gazing
about
her
and
fixing
every
detail
of
the
surroundings
in
her
mind
the
overton
girl
then
wrote
a
note
to
the
clerk
of
the
lodge
telling
him
exactly
what
was
to
be
done
and
that
she
would
remain
on
watch
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
officers
after
dark
she
handed
the
note
to
joe
smoky
face
you
will
come
back
with
the
sheriff
so
he
will
not
miss
the
place
i
have
written
that
you
will
go
now
the
indian
trotted
away
and
grace
saw
him
secrete
the
rifle
he
had
brought
out
with
him
following
his
departure
grace
got
her
bearings
and
started
around
the
mountain
to
rejoin
her
friends
whom
she
knew
were
anxiously
awaiting
a
signal
from
her
the
amazement
of
the
overland
riders
and
their
friends
when
grace
came
walking
in
among
them
was
too
great
for
words
for
a
few
seconds
then
the
overlanders
gave
a
shout
must
pack
up
at
once
and
the
party
must
return
to
the
lodge
made
a
great
discovery
and
solved
the
mystery
of
the
apache
trail
she
announced
grace
then
briefly
related
the
story
of
her
adventure
and
told
the
party
what
she
wished
them
to
do
all
say
nothing
to
any
person
outside
of
our
circle
do
not
even
discuss
our
discovery
among
yourselves
where
possibly
you
may
be
overheard
for
those
men
probably
have
confederates
i
wish
them
to
come
back
so
we
may
capture
them
miss
cartwright
will
you
ride
my
pony
back
to
camp
why
that
the
same
number
of
persons
may
return
on
horseback
go
directly
to
the
camp
then
walk
back
to
the
lodge
i
shall
remain
on
the
mountain
to
watch
the
tunnel
alone
gray
surely
we
can
not
permit
you
to
do
that
objected
general
gordon
shall
remain
there
with
grace
shook
her
head
do
your
absence
would
cause
comment
which
is
exactly
what
i
do
not
wish
having
rifle
and
revolver
i
shall
be
able
to
take
care
of
myself
all
that
i
shall
attempt
to
do
is
to
watch
for
the
return
of
the
bandits
and
make
certain
that
they
do
not
post
a
sentry
outside
you
must
be
going
now
but
for
goodness
sake
pull
up
that
rope
and
string
and
leave
me
some
food
to
carry
in
my
kit
it
is
probable
that
i
shall
not
be
back
until
late
ike
hurriedly
packed
up
and
after
had
been
said
the
party
started
down
the
mountain
side
on
their
way
to
the
point
where
their
horses
were
tethered
grace
soon
lost
sight
of
them
then
tucking
the
rifle
under
her
arm
she
walked
slowly
around
the
mountain
and
down
until
she
came
within
sight
of
the
opening
through
which
she
had
made
her
exit
from
the
tunnel
after
watching
for
some
time
grace
sought
a
hiding
place
which
she
found
in
a
slight
depression
behind
a
shelf
of
shale
rock
she
knew
that
there
were
long
weary
hours
of
waiting
ahead
of
her
but
grace
was
determined
now
that
the
opportunity
was
hers
to
turn
the
tables
for
good
on
the
men
who
had
tormented
the
overland
riders
con
bates
had
escaped
how
she
could
not
imagine
and
ben
jackson
had
assumed
to
himself
the
task
of
revenging
the
grudge
against
the
overland
outfit
that
had
objected
to
being
held
up
and
robbed
grace
passed
most
of
the
time
resting
lying
back
gazing
at
the
sky
and
the
mountains
that
stretched
away
for
many
miles
at
dusk
she
nibbled
at
her
luncheon
then
settled
down
in
earnest
to
her
vigil
a
new
moon
hung
high
in
the
west
which
she
knew
would
shed
a
faint
light
on
her
elevated
position
until
well
into
the
evening
ten
came
but
still
no
bandits
a
few
moments
after
ten
however
patience
was
rewarded
she
discovered
a
crouching
figure
which
at
first
she
took
to
be
an
indian
but
a
moment
later
saw
that
it
was
a
white
man
he
was
followed
at
intervals
by
five
others
all
cautiously
approaching
the
tunnel
entrance
after
a
careful
scrutiny
of
the
entrance
and
apparently
finding
nothing
wrong
there
the
six
men
entered
after
one
had
removed
the
stone
after
the
six
men
had
crawled
in
the
tunnel
opening
was
closed
behind
them
grace
waited
a
few
moments
then
springing
up
ran
to
the
scene
and
began
piling
rocks
on
the
entrance
slab
some
being
so
heavy
that
she
was
obliged
to
roll
them
this
she
continued
until
her
hands
were
blistered
and
her
back
was
aching
desperately
like
to
see
a
bandit
get
out
now
emphasized
the
overland
rider
drawing
off
a
little
way
and
sitting
down
with
rifle
at
ready
in
her
lap
not
a
sound
was
heard
from
the
tunnel
entrance
for
nearly
an
hour
then
a
faint
tapping
there
indicated
to
her
that
the
bandits
were
trying
to
break
their
way
out
the
escape
no
doubt
having
been
discovered
grace
fired
her
rifle
into
the
pile
of
rocks
whereupon
the
tapping
ceased
but
her
vigil
became
an
anxious
one
from
that
moment
on
shortly
after
midnight
the
overton
girl
discovered
a
shadowy
figure
creeping
toward
her
over
the
rocks
grace
eyed
it
keenly
then
levelled
her
rifle
at
it
up
she
commanded
sharply
joe
smoky
face
rose
and
waved
a
hand
right
i
know
you
called
grace
in
a
relieved
tone
of
voice
is
the
sheriff
joe
uttered
a
whistle
whereupon
jim
collins
with
his
deputy
wheaton
and
a
posse
of
ten
men
including
general
gordon
and
lieutenant
wingate
clambered
up
the
rocks
men
are
over
there
sheriff
i
have
blocked
the
entrance
and
believe
they
are
near
it
now
grace
informed
the
sheriff
as
he
came
up
to
her
there
no
other
way
by
which
they
can
get
out
miss
he
asked
know
the
lay
of
the
land
what
do
you
suggest
the
rocks
that
i
have
piled
up
until
you
come
to
the
slab
tell
the
men
there
are
six
in
there
to
lay
down
their
arms
and
come
out
one
at
a
time
should
they
refuse
you
might
tell
them
you
will
keep
them
bottled
up
until
they
surrender
even
if
it
takes
a
the
loose
stones
were
immediately
removed
as
grace
had
suggested
whereupon
the
sheriff
delivered
his
ultimatum
to
the
bandits
lieutenant
wingate
in
the
meantime
had
formed
the
posse
on
the
upper
side
of
the
tunnel
opening
several
minutes
elapsed
without
a
sound
being
heard
from
the
tunnel
then
a
voice
called
to
sheriff
collins
surrender
shoot
out
for
tricks
warned
grace
harlowe
think
that
is
con
bates
the
bandits
pushed
the
slab
from
the
opening
and
came
out
singly
and
apparently
unarmed
out
cried
grace
sharply
almost
in
the
same
instant
a
revolver
in
the
hands
of
con
bates
was
fired
the
five
other
bandits
instantly
began
banging
away
at
the
posse
at
the
same
time
scattering
and
starting
to
run
have
it
low
kill
them
please
begged
grace
sheriff
collins
downed
con
bates
with
a
bullet
in
his
shoulder
grace
took
no
part
in
the
battle
but
sat
crouched
chin
in
hands
narrowly
watching
the
fight
while
bullets
whined
over
her
head
and
ricochetted
from
the
rocks
on
either
side
of
her
the
five
bandits
remaining
after
their
leader
had
been
downed
were
tumbled
over
with
bullets
in
their
legs
in
almost
that
many
seconds
but
the
five
were
plucky
they
struggled
to
their
feet
and
again
began
firing
two
volleys
from
the
posse
put
them
down
a
second
time
and
this
time
they
stayed
down
is
what
i
call
good
shooting
declared
grace
harlowe
standing
up
work
great
work
approved
the
general
fine
bunch
of
critters
you
are
raged
the
sheriff
addressing
the
defeated
bandits
to
finish
you
right
here
thank
this
woman
that
i
do
that
very
thing
do
it
anyhow
if
any
one
of
you
galoots
so
much
as
bats
an
eyelash
throw
those
guns
away
roared
collins
the
bates
gang
gave
up
and
were
quickly
manacled
and
searched
for
further
weapons
the
prisoners
secured
sheriff
collins
strode
over
to
grace
pard
he
cried
thrusting
out
a
wiry
brown
hand
face
an
old
she
bear
with
cubs
laugh
at
her
when
she
made
murder
faces
at
you
we
have
any
more
trouble
with
these
critters
i
reckon
got
the
whole
gang
now
the
trail
is
clear
thanks
to
you
your
at
suggestion
joe
led
the
sheriff
and
some
of
his
men
to
the
tunnel
where
a
large
amount
of
valuable
plunder
was
recovered
that
night
the
prisoners
were
bound
to
horses
and
started
for
the
jail
at
globe
where
this
time
they
remained
until
eventually
sentenced
to
long
terms
in
prison
of
belle
bates
no
trace
was
found
the
guests
of
the
lodge
next
day
gave
a
dance
in
honor
of
the
overlanders
to
whom
belonged
the
honor
of
ridding
the
apache
trail
of
the
last
band
of
desperate
men
that
had
preyed
upon
it
general
gordon
and
his
party
left
a
day
later
after
had
been
regretfully
said
at
suggestion
a
purse
was
made
up
by
the
girls
for
joe
smoky
face
after
he
had
assisted
ike
fairweather
to
pack
the
equipment
in
readiness
for
moving
next
day
and
early
on
the
following
morning
the
overland
riders
set
out
in
their
saddles
for
the
long
journey
to
phœnix
where
they
arrived
a
week
later
tanned
by
sun
and
weather
eyes
sparkling
and
spirits
effervescing
that
day
they
bade
farewell
to
the
faithful
old
stagecoach
driver
who
had
already
shipped
their
ponies
by
rail
and
was
to
follow
the
animals
on
to
globe
that
night
in
the
evening
the
overland
riders
held
a
meeting
at
the
hotel
at
which
they
discussed
their
future
plans
it
was
decided
to
make
the
organization
a
permanent
one
and
to
seek
recreation
and
adventure
in
the
saddle
each
season
until
they
tired
of
it
it
had
been
a
wonderful
vacation
with
just
enough
excitement
to
make
it
interesting
as
grace
expressed
it
leaving
the
girls
of
the
old
overton
unit
better
physically
and
mentally
with
a
new
beauty
in
face
and
figure
each
better
equipped
to
meet
responsibilities
through
the
coming
year
have
not
decided
where
we
shall
go
on
our
next
journey
reminded
elfreda
briggs
next
day
after
the
overlanders
had
settled
themselves
in
a
pullman
car
for
the
homeward
journey
was
just
thinking
of
a
suggestion
offered
by
fairweather
said
grace
telling
me
of
the
adventures
of
a
cousin
of
his
on
the
american
desert
he
casually
mentioned
that
some
time
we
should
try
to
make
the
journey
across
it
in
the
is
there
there
questioned
anne
sand
and
terrific
heat
crossing
the
desert
on
horseback
really
is
a
tremendous
undertaking
but
if
not
strenuous
enough
to
satisfy
us
we
might
even
essay
death
valley
fairweather
said
we
could
get
his
cousin
to
act
as
our
guide
i
am
rather
inclined
toward
the
great
american
desert
go
urged
elfreda
briggs
things
being
equal
what
do
you
say
folks
questioned
grace
smilingly
answered
the
overlanders
enthusiastically
grace
chuckled
do
not
know
it
of
course
but
now
that
you
have
decided
i
am
going
to
say
that
you
overlanders
are
headed
straight
for
an
adventure
that
will
satisfy
even
hippy
wingate
i
have
no
doubt
the
desert
is
yawning
for
us
at
this
very
moment
declared
grace
as
later
events
proved
grace
harlowe
was
not
a
false
prophet
and
in
a
following

entitled

riders
