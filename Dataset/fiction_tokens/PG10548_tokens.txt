by

your

above
this
little
story
i
please
myself
at
the
risk
of
helping
the
reader
to
discover
not
only
that
it
wants
a
something
but
precisely
what
that
something
is
it
wants
to
confess
and

done
with
it
all
the
penetrating

all
the
delicacies

you
would

almost
of

the

a
mural
tablet
in

parish
church
describes
endymion
westcote
as
a
conspicuous
example
of
that
noblest
work
of
god
the
english
country
gentleman
certainly
he
was
a
typical
one
in
almost
every
district
of
england
you
will
find
a
family
which
without
distinguishing
itself
in
any
particular
way
has
held
fast
to
the
comforts
of
life
and
the
respect
of
its
neighbours
for
generation
after
generation
its
men
have
never
shone
in
court
camp
or
senate
they
prefer
tenacity
to
enterprise
look
askance
upon
wit
as
a
dangerous
gift
and
are
even
a
little
suspicious
of
eminence
on
the
other
hand
they
make
excellent
magistrates
maintain
a
code
of
manners
most
salutary
for
the
poor
in
whose
midst
they
live
and
are
looked
up
to
are
as
a
rule
satisfied
like
the
old
athenian
if
they
leave
to
their
heirs
not
less
but
a
little
more
than
they
themselves
inherited
and
deserve
as
they
claim
to
be
called
the
backbone
of
great
britain
many
of
the
women
have
beauty
still
more
have
an
elegance
which
may
pass
for
it
and
almost
all
are
pure
in
thought
truthful
assiduous
in
deeds
of
charity
and
marry
for
love
of
those
manly
qualities
which
they
have
already
esteemed
in
their
brothers
such
a
family
were
the
westcotes
of
bayfield
or
bagvil
in
their
founder
had
settled
in
axcester
towards
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
prospered
mainly
it
was
said
by
usury
a
little
before
his
death
which
befel
in
he
purchased
bayfield
house
from
a
decayed
royalist
who
had
lost
his
only
son
in
the
civil
wars
and
to
bayfield
and
the
ancestral
business
exalted
now
into
banking
his
descendants
continued
faithful
one
or
both
of
the
two
brothers
who
with
their
represented
the
family
in
rode
in
on
every
to
their
in
axcester
high
street
a
georgian
house
of
brick
adorned
with
a
porch
of
plaster
fluted
to
the
shape
of
a
out
of
which
cupid
smiled
down
upon
a
brass
plate
and
the
inscription
westcote
and
westcote
and
on
the
first
floor
with
windows
as
tall
as
the
rooms
so
that
from
the
street
you
could
see
through
one
the
shapely
legs
of
endymion
westcote
at
his
table
and
through
another
the
legs
of
narcissus
the
third
and
midmost
window
was
a
dummy
having
been
bricked
up
to
avoid
the
imposed
by
pitt
in
whose
statesmanship
however
the
brothers
had
firmly
believed
their
somewhat
fantastic
names
were
traditional
in
the
westcote
pedigree
and
dated
from
the
seventeenth
century
endymion
the
elder
who
took
the
lead
of
narcissus
in
all
things
was
the
fine
flower
of
the
westcote
stocks
and
out
of
question
the
most
influential
man
in
axcester
and
for
many
a
mile
round
justice
of
the
peace
for
the
county
of
somerset
and
major
of
its
yeomanry
he
served
our
town
so
he
called
it
as
overseer
of
the
poor
governor
of
the
grammar
school
chairman
of
feoffees
churchwarden
everything
in
short
but
mayor
an
office
which
he
left
to
the
tradesmen
while
taking
care
to
speak
of
it
always
with
respect
and
indeed
to
see
it
properly
filled
the
part
of
county
magistrate
to
which
he
had
been
born
he
played
to
perfection
and
with
a
full
sense
of
its
dignified
amenity
it
was
whispered
that
the
lord
lieutenant
himself
stood
in
some
awe
of
him
his
favourite
character
however
was
that
of
plain
citizen
of
his
native
town
i
an
axcester
man
he
would
declare
in
his
public
speeches
and
in
his
own
way
he
loved
and
served
the
little
borough
for
its
good
he
held
its
parliamentary
representation
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
as
overseer
of
the
poor
had
dared
public
displeasure
by
revising
the
voters
list
and
defying
a
mandamus
of
the
court
of
king
bench
rather
than
allow
axcester
to
fail
in
its
duty
of
returning
two
members
to
support
percevall
ministry
in
when
the
price
of
wheat
rose
to
a
quarter
a
poor
woman
dropped
dead
in
the
market
place
of
starvation
at
once
a
mob
collected
hoisted
a
on
a
pole
with
the
label
we
will
have
bread
or
blood
and
started
to
pillage
the
shop
in
high
street
it
was
endymion
westcote
who
rode
up
they
were
carrying
the
only
constable
on
their
shoulders
and
faced
and
dispersed
the
rioters
it
was
he
who
headed
the
subscription
list
prevailed
on
the
purchase
a
of
potatoes
and
persuaded
the
people
to
plant
them
for
even
the
seed
potatoes
had
been
eaten
and
the
gardens
lay
undigged
it
was
he
who
met
the
immediate
famine
by
importing
large
quantities
of
rice
finally
it
was
he
through
his
influence
with
the
county
who
brought
back
prosperity
by
getting
the
french
prisoners
sent
to
axcester
we
shall
talk
of
these
french
prisoners
by
and
by
to
conclude
this
portrait
of
endymion
westcote
he
was
a
handsome
man
over
six
feet
in
height
and
past
his
year
a
bachelor
and
a
protestant
in
his
youth
he
had
been
noted
for
gallantry
and
preserved
some
traces
of
it
in
his
address
his
grandfather
had
married
a
french
lady
and
although
this
union
had
not
sensibly
diluted
the
westcote
blood
endymion
would
refer
to
it
to
palliate
a
youthful
taste
for
playing
the
fiddle
he
spoke
french
fluently
with
a
british
accent
which
when
appointed
commissary
he
took
pains
to
improve
by
conversation
with
the
prisoners
and
was
fond
of
discussing
heredity
with
the
two
most
distinguished
of
them
the
vicomte
de
tocqueville
and
general
rochambeau
narcissus
the
younger
brother
had
neither
the
height
nor
the
good
looks
nor
the
masterful
carriage
of
endymion
and
made
no
pretence
to
rival
him
as
a
man
of
affairs
he
professed
to
be
known
as
the
student
of
the
family
dabbled
in
archaeology
and
managed
two
or
three
local
societies
and
field
clubs
which
met
ostensibly
to
listen
to
his
papers
but
really
to
picnic
an
accident
had
decided
this
bent
of
his
the
discovery
during
some
repairs
of
a
fine
roman
pavement
beneath
the
floor
of
bayfield
house
at
the
age
of
eighteen
during
a
cambridge
vacation
narcissus
had
written
and
privately
printed
a
description
of
this
pavement
proving
not
only
that
its
tessellae
represented
scenes
in
the
mythological
story
of
bacchus
but
that
the
name
bayfield
in
some
old
deeds
and
documents
written
bagvil
or
baggevil
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
corruption
of
axcester
and
its
neighbourhood
are
rich
in
roman
remains
the
town
stands
indeed
on
the
old
fosse
way
and
tempted
by
early
success
narcissus
rode
his
hobby
further
and
further
afield
now
at
the
age
of
he
could
claim
to
be
an
authority
on
the
roman
occupation
of
britain
and
especially
on
the
conquests
of
vespasian
the
circle
of
the
westcotes
acquaintance
gathered
in
the
fine
hall
of
bayfield
or
as
narcissus
preferred
to
call
it
the
atrium
drank
tea
admired
the
pavement
listened
to
the
alleged
exploits
of
vespasian
and
wondered
when
the
brothers
would
marry
time
went
on
repeating
these
assemblies
and
the
question
became
will
they
ever
marry
apparently
they
had
no
thought
of
it
no
idea
that
it
was
expected
of
them
and
since
they
had
both
passed
forty
the
question
might
be
taken
as
answered
but
that
so
personable
a
man
as
endymion
westcote
would
let
the
family
perish
was
monstrous
to
suppose
he
kept
his
good
looks
and
his
fresh
complexion
even
now
some
maiden
would
easily
be
found
to
answer
his
olympian
nod
and
a
vein
of
recklessness
sometimes
cropped
up
through
his
habitual
caution
and
kept
his
friends
alert
for
surprises
in
the
for
instance
and
he
rode
to
hounds
twice
a
week
he
made
a
rule
of
avoiding
fences
but
the
world
quite
rightly
set
this
down
to
a
proper
care
for
his
person
rather
than
to
timidity
since
on
one
famous
occasion
riding
up
to
find
the
whole
field
hesitating
before
a
rasper
they
were
hunting
a
strange
country
that
day
he
put
his
horse
at
it
and
sailed
over
with
a
nonchalance
relieved
only
by
his
ringing
laugh
on
the
farther
side
it
was
odds
he
would
clear
the
fence
of
matrimony
some
day
with
the
same
casual
heartiness
and
in
any
case
he
was
masterful
enough
to
insist
on
narcissus
marrying
should
it
occur
to
him
to
wish
it
oddly
enough
the
gossips
who
still
arranged
marriages
for
the
brothers
had
given
over
speculating
upon
their
hostess
miss
dorothea
she
could
not
of
course
perpetuate
the
name
but
this
by
no
means
accounted
for
all
the
difference
in
their
concern
dorothea
westcote
was
now
seven
or
five
years
younger
than
narcissus
whose
mother
had
died
soon
after
his
birth
the
widower
had
created
one
of
the
few
scandals
in
the
westcote
history
by
espousing
some
four
years
later
a
young
woman
of
quite
inferior
class
the
daughter
of
a
wholesale
glover
in
axcester
the
new
wife
had
good
looks
but
they
did
not
procure
her
pardon
and
she
made
the
amplest
and
speediest
amends
by
dying
within
twelve
months
and
leaving
a
daughter
who
in
no
way
resembled
her
the
husband
survived
her
just
a
dozen
years
dorothea
the
daughter
was
a
plain
girl
her
brothers
though
kind
and
fond
of
her
after
a
fashion
did
not
teach
her
to
forget
it
she
loved
them
but
her
love
partook
of
awe
they
were
so
much
cleverer
as
well
as
handsomer
than
she
having
no
mother
or
friend
of
her
own
sex
to
imitate
she
grow
into
an
awkward
woman
sensitive
to
charm
in
others
and
responding
to
it
without
jealousy
but
ignorant
of
what
it
meant
or
how
it
could
be
acquired
she
picked
up
some
french
from
her
brother
endymion
and
masters
were
hired
who
taught
her
to
dance
to
paint
in
water
colours
and
to
play
with
moderate
skill
upon
the
harp
but
few
partners
had
ever
sought
her
in
the
ballroom
her
only
drawings
which
anyone
ever
asked
to
see
were
of
the
bayfield
pavement
executed
for
narcissus
monograph
and
her
harp
she
played
in
her
own
room
now
and
then
endymion
would
enquire
how
she
progressed
with
her
music
would
listen
to
her
report
and
observe
ah
i
used
to
do
a
little
fiddling
myself
but
he
never
put
her
proficiency
to
the
test
somehow
and
long
before
the
world
came
to
the
same
conclusion
she
had
resolved
that
marriage
was
not
for
her
she
adored
babies
though
they
usually
screamed
at
the
sight
of
her
and
she
thought
it
would
be
delightful
to
have
one
of
her
own
who
would
not
scream
but
apart
from
this
vague
sentiment
she
accepted
her
fate
without
sensible
regret
by
watching
and
copying
the
mistresses
of
the
few
houses
she
visited
she
learned
to
play
the
hostess
at
bayfield
and
as
time
brought
confidence
played
it
with
credit
she
knew
that
people
laughed
at
her
and
that
yet
they
liked
her
their
liking
and
their
laughter
puzzled
her
about
equally
for
the
rest
she
was
proud
of
bayfield
and
content
though
one
day
much
resembled
another
to
live
all
her
life
there
devoted
to
god
and
her
garden
visitors
always
praised
her
garden
axcester
lies
on
the
western
side
and
mostly
at
the
foot
of
a
low
hill
set
accurately
in
the
centre
of
a
ring
of
hills
slightly
raised
bottom
of
a
saucer
would
be
no
bad
simile
the
old
roman
road
cuts
straight
across
this
rise
descends
between
the
shops
of
the
high
street
passes
the
church
crosses
the
axe
by
a
narrow
bridge
and
climbing
again
passes
the
iron
gates
of
bayfield
house
a
mile
above
the
river
so
straight
is
it
that
dorothea
could
keep
her
brothers
in
view
from
the
gates
until
they
dismounted
before
their
office
door
losing
sight
of
them
for
a
minute
or
two
only
among
the
elms
by
the
bridge
her
boudoir
window
commanded
the
same
prospect
and
every
day
as
the
london
coach
topped
the
hill
her
maid
polly
would
run
with
news
of
it
the
two
would
be
watching
often
before
the
guard
horn
awoke
the
street
and
fetched
the
ostlers
out
in
a
hurry
from
the
dogs
inn
stables
with
their
relay
of
four
horses
miss
dorothea
possessed
a
telescope
too
and
if
the
coach
were
dressed
with
laurels
and
flags
announcing
a
victory
mistress
and
maid
would
run
to
the
gates
and
wave
their
handkerchiefs
as
it
passed
sometimes
too
polly
would
announce
a
and
the
telescope
decide
whether
the
postboys
wore
the
blue
or
the
buff
nor
were
these
their
only
causes
of
excitement
for
the
great
bayfield
elm
a
rood
below
the
gates
and
in
full
view
of
them
marked
the
westward
boundary
of
the
french
prisoners
on
parole
some
of
these
were
quite
regular
in
their
walks
for
instance
de
and
general
rochambeau
who
came
at
three
or
thereabouts
on
wednesdays
and
saturdays
summer
and
winter
at
six
paces
on
the
far
side
of
the
elm
such
was
their
punctilio
they
halted
took
snuff
linked
arms
again
and
turned
back
dorothea
had
entertained
them
both
at
bayfield
and
met
them
at
dinner
in
one
or
two
neighbouring
houses
on
the
same
days
and
on
mondays
as
well
old
jean
pierre
pichou
of
the
frigate
would
come
along
with
julien
carales
alias
frap
des
pichou
with
his
wooden
leg
and
frap
twisting
a
grey
moustache
and
uttering
a
steady
torrent
of
imprecation
or
so
it
sounded
these
could
be
counted
on
but
scores
of
others
stopped
and
turned
at
the
bayfield
elm
and
polly
had
names
for
them
all
moreover
on
one
memorable
day
dorothea
had
watched
one
who
did
not
halt
precisely
at
the
elm
a
few
paces
beyond
it
and
on
the
side
of
the
road
facing
the
grounds
straggled
an
old
orchard
out
of
which
her
brother
endymion
had
been
missing
of
late
a
quantity
of
his
favourite
pippins
by
name
but
it
may
have
been
a
local
one
somerset
warriors
the
month
was
october
the
time
about
four
the
light
dusky
yet
miss
dorothea
lingering
by
the
gate
saw
a
young
man
pass
the
bayfield
elm
and
climb
the
hedge
and
saw
and
heard
him
nail
against
an
overhanging
the
road
a
board
with
white
letters
on
a
black
ground
when
it
was
fixed
the
artist
descended
to
the
road
and
gazed
up
admiringly
at
his
work
in
the
act
of
departing
he
turned
and
suddenly
stood
still
again
his
face
was
toward
the
bayfield
gate
dorothea
could
not
tell
if
he
saw
her
but
he
remained
thus
motionless
for
almost
a
minute
then
he
seemed
to
recollect
himself
and
marched
off
briskly
down
the
road
early
next
morning
she
descended
and
read
the
inscription
which
ran
restaurant
pour
les
aspirants
she
said
nothing
about
it
and
soon
after
breakfast
the
board
was
removed
chapter
ii
the
orange
room
some
weeks
later
on
a
bright
and
frosty
morning
in
december
dorothea
rode
into
axcester
with
her
brothers
she
was
a
good
horsewoman
and
showed
to
advantage
on
horseback
when
her
slight
figure
took
a
grace
of
movement
which
made
amends
for
her
face
the
brisk
air
and
a
canter
across
the
bridge
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
had
brought
roses
to
her
cheeks
and
she
looked
almost
pretty
general
rochambeau
happened
to
pass
down
the
street
as
the
three
drew
rein
before
the
town
house
so
the
westcotes
always
called
the
and
pausing
to
help
her
dismount
paid
her
a
very
handsome
compliment
dorothea
knew
of
course
that
frenchmen
were
lavish
of
compliments
and
had
heard
general
rochambeau
pay
them
where
she
felt
sure
they
were
not
deserved
nevertheless
she
found
this
one
pleasant
she
had
received
so
few
and
laughed
happily
it
may
have
come
from
the
freshness
of
the
morning
but
her
spirit
sat
light
within
her
and
expectant
she
could
not
say
of
what
yet
it
seemed
that
something
good
was
going
to
happen
i
have
a
guess
said
the
old
general
that
miss
westcote
and
i
are
bound
on
the
same
errand
her
can
not
be
to
inspect
dull
bonds
and
ledgers
bills
of
exchange
or
rates
of
interest
he
jerked
his
head
towards
the
house
and
dorothea
shook
hers
i
am
going
to
dogs
general
eh
he
scented
the
jest
and
chuckled
as
you
say
the
hein
messieurs
i
beg
you
to
observe
and
take
warning
that
your
sister
and
i
are
going
to
the
dogs
together
he
offered
his
arm
to
dorothea
her
brothers
had
dismounted
and
handed
their
horses
over
to
the
ostler
who
waited
by
the
porch
daily
to
lead
them
to
the
inn
stables
i
will
stable
mercury
myself
said
she
addressing
endymion
she
submitted
her
smallest
plans
to
him
for
approval
do
so
he
answered
after
running
through
my
letters
i
will
step
down
to
the
orange
room
and
join
you
i
entrust
her
to
you
general
the
more
confidently
because
you
can
not
take
her
far
he
laughed
and
followed
narcissus
through
the
porch
dorothea
saw
the
old
general
wince
she
slipped
an
arm
through
mercury
and
picked
up
her
skirt
the
other
arm
she
laid
in
her
companion
you
have
not
seen
the
orange
room
miss
dorothea
not
since
the
decorations
began
she
paused
and
uttered
the
thought
uppermost
in
her
mind
you
must
forgive
my
brother
i
am
sorry
he
spoke
as
he
did
just
now
then
he
is
more
than
forgiven
he
did
not
consider
dear
mademoiselle
your
brother
is
an
excellent
fellow
and
not
a
bit
more
popular
than
he
deserves
to
be
of
his
kindness
to
us
prisoners
i
speak
not
of
us
privileged
ones
but
of
our
poorer
brothers
i
could
name
a
thousand
acts
and
acts
say
more
than
words
dorothea
pursed
her
lips
i
am
not
sure
i
think
a
woman
would
ask
for
words
too
yes
that
is
so
he
caught
her
up
but
do
you
see
that
we
prisoners
are
forgive
me
just
like
women
i
mean
we
have
learned
that
we
are
weak
for
a
man
that
is
no
easy
lesson
mademoiselle
i
myself
learned
it
hardly
and
seeing
your
brother
admired
by
all
so
strong
and
prosperous
and
confident
can
i
ask
that
he
should
feel
as
we
who
have
forfeited
these
things
before
she
could
find
a
reply
he
had
harked
back
to
the
orange
room
you
have
not
seen
it
since
the
decorations
began
then
i
have
a
mind
to
run
and
ask
your
brother
to
forbid
your
coming
to
command
you
to
wait
until
wednesday
we
are
in
a
horrible
mess
i
warn
you
and
smell
of
turpentine
most
potently
but
we
shall
be
ready
for
the
ball
and
then
it
will
be
prodigious
you
do
not
know
that
we
have
a
genius
at
work
on
the
painting
my
brother
tells
me
the
designs
are
extraordinarily
clever
they
are
more
than
clever
you
will
allow
the
artist
i
discovered
myself
a
young
man
named
charles
raoul
he
comes
from
the
south
a
little
below
avignon
and
of
good
family
in
some
respects
the
general
paused
and
took
snuff
he
enlisted
at
eighteen
and
has
seen
service
he
tells
me
he
was
wounded
at
austerlitz
unhappily
he
was
shipped
about
two
years
ago
on
board
the
frigate
with
a
detachment
and
stores
for
martinique
the
had
scarcely
left
before
she
fell
in
with
one
of
your
frigates
whose
name
escapes
me
and
here
he
is
in
axcester
he
has
rich
relatives
but
for
some
reason
or
other
they
decline
to
support
him
and
yet
he
seems
a
gentleman
he
picks
up
a
few
shillings
by
painting
portraits
but
you
english
are
shy
of
sitting
i
wonder
why
and
we
well
i
suppose
we
prefer
to
wait
till
our
faces
grow
happier
dorothea
had
it
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
to
ask
how
the
general
had
discovered
this
genius
but
the
ring
in
his
voice
gave
her
pause
twice
in
the
course
of
their
short
walk
he
had
shown
feeling
and
she
wondered
at
it
having
hitherto
regarded
him
as
a
cynical
old
fellow
with
a
wit
which
cracked
himself
and
the
world
like
two
dry
nuts
for
the
jest
of
their
shrivelled
kernels
she
did
not
know
that
a
kind
word
of
hers
had
unlocked
his
heart
and
before
she
could
recall
her
question
they
had
reached
the
of
the
dogs
and
after
stabling
mercury
it
was
but
a
step
across
to
the
inn
the
dogs
inn
took
its
name
from
two
stone
greyhounds
beside
its
porch
supporters
of
the
arms
of
that
old
family
from
which
the
westcotes
had
purchased
bayfield
and
the
orange
room
from
a
tradition
that
william
of
orange
had
spent
a
night
there
on
his
march
from
torbay
there
may
have
been
truth
in
the
tradition
the
room
at
any
rate
preserved
in
it
of
and
a
deep
fringe
of
the
same
hue
festooning
the
musicians
gallery
while
serving
axcester
for
ball
rout
and
general
it
had
been
admittedly
dismal
its
walls
scarred
and
patched
with
new
plaster
and
relieved
only
by
a
gigantic
painting
of
the
royal
arms
on
panel
in
a
blackened
frame
its
ceiling
garnished
with
four
pendants
in
plaster
like
cake
ornaments
inverted
as
she
stepped
across
the
threshold
dorothea
hesitated
between
stopping
her
ears
and
rubbing
her
eyes
the
place
was
a
babel
frenchmen
in
white
paper
caps
and
stained
linen
blouses
were
laughing
plying
their
brushes
mixing
paints
shifting
ladders
and
jabbering
all
the
while
at
the
pitch
of
their
voices
for
a
moment
the
din
bewildered
her
the
ferment
had
no
more
meaning
no
more
method
than
a
schoolboy
game
but
her
eyes
passing
over
the
chaos
of
brushes
and
told
her
the
place
had
been
transformed
the
ceiling
between
the
four
pendants
had
become
a
blue
heaven
with
filmy
clouds
and
cupids
scattering
roses
before
a
train
of
doves
and
a
recumbent
goddess
whom
a
little
italian
perched
on
a
scaffolding
and
whistling
shrilly
was
varnishing
for
dear
life
around
the
walls
also
trellises
of
vines
and
pink
roses
clambered
around
the
old
panels
the
energy
of
the
workmen
had
passed
into
their
paintings
or
perhaps
dorothea
head
swam
at
any
rate
the
cupids
and
doves
seemed
to
be
whirling
across
the
ceiling
the
vines
and
roses
mounting
towards
it
and
pushing
out
shoots
and
tendrils
while
they
climbed
but
the
panels
themselves
they
were
nine
in
all
three
down
the
long
black
wall
two
narrower
ones
at
the
far
end
four
between
the
curtained
windows
looking
on
the
street
the
fourth
wall
had
no
panel
being
covered
by
the
musicians
gallery
and
the
pillars
supporting
it
in
each
framed
by
the
vines
and
roses
glowed
a
scene
of
classical
or
splendour
golden
sunsets
pale
yellow
skies
landscapes
cleverly
imitated
from
recollections
of
claude
lorraine
dotted
with
temples
and
small
figures
in
flowing
drapery
with
here
and
there
a
glimpse
of
naked
limbs
here
were
bacchus
and
ariadne
with
a
company
of
dancing
revellers
apollo
and
marsyas
the

dido
welcoming
dorothea
albeit
she
had
often
glanced
into
the
copy
of
lempriere
classical
dictionary
in
her
brother
library
and
besides
had
picked
up
something
of
greek
and
roman
mythology
in
helping
narcissus
did
not
at
once
discriminate
the
subjects
of
these
panels
but
her
eyes
rested
on
them
with
a
pleasant
sense
of
recognition
and
were
still
resting
on
them
when
she
heard
general
rochambeau
say
ah
there
is
my
genius
you
must
let
me
present
him
mademoiselle
he
will
amuse
you
hi
there
raoul
a
young
man
standing
amid
a
group
of
workmen
and
criticising
one
of
the
panels
between
the
curtains
turned
sharply
almost
before
dorothea
was
aware
he
had
doffed
his
paper
cap
and
the
general
was
introducing
him
she
recognised
him
at
once
he
was
the
young
prisoner
who
had
nailed
the
board
against
her
brother
he
bowed
and
began
at
once
to
apologise
for
the
state
of
the
room
he
had
expected
no
visitors
before
wednesday
the
general
had
played
a
surprise
upon
him
and
miss
westcote
alas
was
a
critic
especially
of
classical
subjects
he
had
heard
of
her
drawings
for
her
brother
book
dorothea
blushed
indeed
i
am
no
artist
please
do
not
talk
of
those
drawings
if
you
only
knew
how
much
i
am
ashamed
of
them
and
besides
they
were
meant
as
diagrams
to
help
the
reader
not
as
illustrations
but
these
are
beautiful
he
turned
with
a
pleasant
laugh
she
had
already
taken
note
of
his
voice
but
his
laugh
was
even
more
musical
daphne
pursued
by
apollo
he
commenced
waving
his
hand
towards
the
panel
in
face
of
her
be
pleased
to
observe
the
lady
sinking
into
the
bush
an
effect
which
the
ingenious
painter
has
stolen
from
no
less
a
masterpiece
than
the
buisson
ardent
of
nicholas
froment
the
general
fumbled
for
the
ribbon
of
his
gold
raoul
moved
towards
the
next
panel
and
dorothea
followed
him
perseus
entering
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
the
painting
though
slapdash
was
astonishingly
clever
and
in
this
as
in
other
panels
no
trace
of
the
artist
hurry
appeared
in
the
reposeful
design
coiled
about
the
foot
of
the
tree
the
dragon
ladon
blinked
an
eye
lazily
at
three
maidens
pacing
hand
in
hand
in
the
dance
with
dark
boughs
and
golden
fruit
behind
them
perseus
with
naked
sword
halted
in
admiration
half
issuing
from
a
thicket
over
which
stretched
a
distant
bright
line
of
sea
and
white
cliff
you
like
it
he
asked
but
it
is
not
quite
finished
yet
and
mademoiselle
if
she
is
frank
will
say
that
it
wants
something
his
voice
held
a
challenge
i
am
sure
sir
i
could
not
guess
even
if
i
possessed
a
board
for
example
a
board
she
was
completely
puzzled
he
glanced
at
her
sideways
turned
to
the
panel
and
with
his
forefingers
traced
the
outline
of
a
square
upon
it
against
the
tree
restaurant
pour
les
aspirants
he
announced
he
said
it
quietly
over
his
shoulder
the
sudden
challenge
her
sudden
discovery
that
he
knew
made
dorothea
gasp
she
had
not
the
smallest
notion
how
to
answer
him
or
even
what
kind
of
answer
he
expected
and
stood
dumb
gazing
at
his
back
a
workman
passing
apologised
for
having
brushed
her
skirt
with
the
he
carried
she
stammered
some
words
of
pardon
and
just
then
to
her
relief
her
brother
endymion
voice
rang
out
from
the
doorway
ah
there
you
are
well
i
declare
he
looked
around
him
a
paradise
a
perfect
paradise
indeed
general
your
nation
has
its
revenge
of
us
in
the
arts
you
build
a
temple
for
us
and
on
wednesday
i
hear
you
are
to
provide
the
music
he
hummed
a
few
bars
of
gluck
paride
ed
elenna
and
paused
with
the
gesture
of
one
holding
a
fiddle
on
the
verge
of
a
reminiscence
there
was
a
time
but
i
no
longer
compete
and
to
whom
general
are
we
indebted
for
this
ah
treat
general
rochambeau
indicated
young
raoul
who
stepped
forward
from
the
wall
and
answered
with
a
respectful
inclination
well
le
commissaire
in
the
first
place
to
captain
seymour
the
general
bit
his
moustache
endymion
frowned
the
answer
merely
puzzled
dorothea
who
did
not
know
that
seymour
was
the
name
of
the
british
officer
to
whom
the
had
struck
her
colours
moreover
the
young
man
went
on
imperturbably
we
but
repay
our
debt
to
le
commissaire
for
the
entertainment
he
affords
us
dorothea
looked
up
sharply
now
even
anxiously
but
her
brother
took
the
shot
if
shot
it
were
for
a
compliment
he
put
the
awkward
idiom
aside
with
a
gracious
wave
of
the
hand
his
brow
cleared
but
we
must
do
something
for
these
poor
fellows
he
announced
sweeping
all
the
in
a
gaze
in
mere
gratitude
we
must
a
stall
now
at
the
end
of
the
room
under
the
gallery
with
one
or
two
salesmen
whom
you
must
recommend
to
me
general
we
might
dispose
of
quite
a
number
of
their
small
carvings
and
de
with
which
the
market
among
the
townspeople
is
decidedly
overstocked
the
company
on
wednesday
will
be
less
familiar
with
them
they
will
serve
as
mementoes
and
the
prices
i
daresay
will
not
be
too
closely
considered
sir
i
beg
of
you
general
rochambeau
expostulated
eh
they
have
given
their
labour
such
as
it
is
in
pure
gratitude
for
the
kindness
shown
to
them
by
all
in
axcester
that
has
been
the
whole
meaning
of
our
small
enterprise
the
old
gentleman
persisted
still
i
do
suppose
they
object
if
it
brings
a
little
beef
to
their
say
no
more
say
no
more
what
have
we
here
eh
and
ariadne
i
am
rusty
in
my
classics
but
bacchus
dorothea
this
will
please
narcissus
we
have
in
our
house
sir
here
he
addressed
raoul
a
roman
pavement
entirely
ah
concerned
with
that
personage
it
is
i
believe
unique
one
of
these
days
i
must
give
you
a
permit
to
visit
bayfield
and
inspect
it
with
my
brother
for
it
will
repay
you
it
will
more
than
repay
me
the
young
man
interposed
with
his
gaze
demurely
bent
on
the
wall
i
should
have
said
it
will
repay
your
inspection
you
must
jog
my
memory
it
was
clear
raoul
had
a
reply
on
his
tongue
but
he
glanced
at
dorothea
read
her
expression
and
turning
to
her
brother
bowed
again
her
first
feeling
was
of
gratitude
a
moment
later
she
blamed
herself
for
having
asked
his
forbearance
by
a
look
and
him
for
his
confidence
in
seeking
that
look
his
eyes
during
the
moment
they
encountered
hers
had
said
we
one
another
he
had
no
right
to
assume
so
much
and
yet
she
had
not
denied
it
endymion
westcote
meanwhile
had
picked
up
a
small
book
which
lay
face
downward
on
one
of
the
so
here
is
the
source
of
your
inspiration
said
he
an
how
it
brings
up
old
at
winchester
old
swishings
too
general
hey
he
held
the
book
open
and
studied
the
ariadne
on
the
wall
the
source
of
my
inspiration
indeed
le
commissaire
but
you
will
not
find
ariadne
in
that
text
which
contains
only
the
ah
but
i
told
you
my
classics
were
a
bit
rusty
replied
the
commissary
he
made
the
round
of
the
walls
and
commended
in
his
breezy
way
each
separate
panel
you
must
take
my
criticisms
for
what
they
are
worth
raoul
but
my
grandmother
was
a
frenchwoman
and
that
gives
me
a
kind
of
sympathy
shall
we
say
moreover
i
know
what
i
like
dorothea
accustomed
to
regard
her
brother
as
a
demigod
caught
herself
blushing
for
him
she
was
angry
with
herself
she
caught
murmur
heaven
distributes
to
us
our
talents
monsieur
and
was
angry
with
him
understanding
and
deprecating
the
raillery
beneath
his
perfectly
correct
attitude
he
kept
this
attitude
to
the
end
when
the
time
came
for
parting
he
bent
over
her
hand
and
whispered
again
but
it
was
kind
of
mademoiselle
not
to
report
me
she
heard
it
set
up
a
secret
understanding
between
them
which
she
resented
there
was
nothing
to
say
again
yet
she
had
found
no
way
of
rebuking
him
she
was
angry
with
herself
all
the
way
home
chapter
iii
a
ball
a
snowstorm
and
a
snowball
axcester
december
ball
was
a
social
event
of
importance
in
south
somerset
at
once
formal
and
familiar
familiar
since
of
the
company
dwelt
close
enough
together
to
be
on
visiting
terms
it
nicely
preluded
the
domestic
festivities
of
christmas
and
the
more
public
ones
which
began
with
the
new
year
and
culminated
in
the
great
county
balls
at
taunton
and
bath
nor
were
the
families
around
axcester
jaded
with
dancing
as
those
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bath
for
example
but
discussed
dresses
and
the
prospects
of
the
ball
for
some
weeks
beforehand
and
when
the
day
came
ordered
out
the
chariot
or
barouche
in
defiance
of
any
ordinary
weather
the
weather
since
dorothea
visit
to
the
orange
room
had
included
a
frost
a
fall
of
snow
with
a
partial
thaw
and
a
second
and
much
severer
frost
and
by
wednesday
afternoon
the
hill
below
bayfield
wore
a
hard
and
slippery
glaze
endymion
however
had
seen
to
the
roughing
of
the
horses
thin
powdery
snow
began
to
fall
as
the
bayfield
barouche
rolled
past
the
gates
into
the
high
road
and
narcissus
who
considered
himself
a
foretold
a
thaw
before
morning
unless
the
weather
grew
worse
the
party
would
drive
back
to
bayfield
but
the
old
caretaker
in
the
town
house
had
orders
to
light
fires
there
and
prepare
the
bedrooms
and
on
the
chance
of
being
detained
dorothea
had
brought
her
maid
polly
in
spite
of
her
previous
visit
the
orange
room
gave
her
a
shock
of
delight
and
wonder
the
litter
had
vanished
the
hangings
were
in
place
fresh
curtains
divided
the
from
the
recess
beneath
the
gallery
and
this
had
been
furnished
as
a
with
rugs
settees
groups
of
green
foliage
plants
and
candles
the
light
of
which
shone
through
shades
of
yellow
paper
the
prisoners
too
had
adorned
with
varicoloured
paperwork
the
candelabra
girandoles
and
mirrors
which
drew
twinkles
from
the
long
waxed
floor
and
softened
whatever
might
have
been
garish
in
the
decorations
certainly
the
panels
took
a
new
beauty
a
luminous
delicacy
in
their
artificial
rays
and
dorothea
when
after
much
greeting
and
she
joined
one
of
the
groups
inspecting
them
felt
a
sort
of
proprietary
pleasure
in
the
praises
she
heard
had
she
known
it
she
too
was
looking
her
best
tonight
in
an
maidish
fashion
be
it
understood
she
wore
a
gown
of
muslin
edged
with
swansdown
and
tied
with
sash
and
of
a
ribbon
which
had
taken
her
fancy
at
bath
in
the
autumn
her
stockings
gloves
cap
she
had
worn
caps
for
six
or
seven
years
now
even
her
fan
were
of
the
same
grey
dorothea
knew
how
to
dress
she
also
knew
how
to
dance
the
music
made
her
heart
beat
faster
and
she
never
entered
a
without
a
sense
of
happy
expectancy
poor
lady
she
never
left
but
she
carried
home
weariness
and
a
discontent
of
which
she
purged
her
soul
on
her
knees
before
lying
down
to
sleep
she
had
a
contrite
spirit
she
knew
that
her
lot
was
a
fortunate
one
but
she
envied
her
maid
polly
her
good
looks
at
times
with
polly
face
she
might
have
dancing
to
her
heart
content
usually
she
dropped
some
tears
on
her
pillow
after
a
night
gaiety
at
bath
at
taunton
at
axcester
it
had
always
been
the
same
and
with
time
she
had
learnt
to
set
her
hopes
low
and
steel
her
heart
early
to
their
inevitable
disappointment
so
tonight
she
took
her
seat
against
the
wall
and
watched
while
the
first
three
went
by
without
bringing
her
a
partner
for
the
fourth
the
soldier
joy
she
was
claimed
by
an
awkward
schoolboy
home
for
the
holidays
whether
out
of
duty
or
obeying
the
law
of
nature
by
which
shy
youths
are
attracted
to
partners
she
could
not
tell
nor
did
she
ask
herself
but
danced
the
dance
and
enjoyed
it
more
than
her
cavalier
was
ever
likely
to
guess
such
a
chance
had
before
now
been
looked
back
upon
as
the
one
bright
spot
in
a
long
evening
experience
dorothea
loved
all
schoolboys
for
the
kindness
shown
to
her
by
these
few
she
went
back
to
her
seat
hard
by
a
group
to
which
endymion
was
discoursing
at
large
endymion
was
a
mellow
voice
of
rich
compass
and
he
had
a
knack
of
compelling
the
attention
of
all
persons
within
range
he
preferred
this
to
addressing
anyone
in
particular
and
his
eye
sought
and
found
and
gathered
by
instinct
the
last
loiterer
without
the
charmed
circle
yes
he
was
saying
it
is
tasteful
and
something
more
it
illustrates
as
you
well
say
the
better
side
of
our
excitable
neighbours
across
the
channel
setting
patriotism
apart
and
regarding
the
question
merely
in
its
ah
philosophical
aspect
it
has
often
occurred
to
me
to
wonder
how
a
nation
so
expert
in
the
arts
of
life
so
how
shall
i
put
it
natty
suggested
one
of
his
hearers
but
he
waved
the
word
of
such
lightness
of
touch
as
i
might
describe
it
i
say
it
has
often
occurred
to
me
to
wonder
how
such
a
nation
could
so
far
mistake
its
destiny
and
the
designs
of
providence
inscrutable
though
they
be
as
to
embark
on
a
career
of
foreign
conquest
which
can
only
ah
have
one
end
come
to
grief
put
in
lady
bateson
a
dowager
in
a
crimson
cap
with
military
feathers
she
was
supposed
to
cherish
a
hopeless
passion
for
endymion
also
she
was
supposed
to
be
acting
as
dorothea
chaperon
tonight
but
having
with
little
exertion
found
partners
for
a
niece
of
her
own
a
sprightly
young
lady
on
a
visit
from
bath
felt
that
she
deserved
to
relax
her
mind
in
a
little
intellectual
talk
endymion
accepted
her
remark
with
magnificent
tolerance
precisely
he
inclined
towards
her
you
have
hit
it
precisely
dorothea
stole
a
glance
at
her
brother
military
and
hunt
uniforms
were
at
these
axcester
balls
and
a
major
of
yeomanry
more
splendid
than
endymion
westcote
it
would
have
been
hard
to
find
in
england
he
stood
with
a
hand
negligently
resting
on
his
left
hip
the
word
hip
his
right
foot
advanced
the
toe
of
his
polished
boot
tapping
the
floor
his
smile
indulgent
as
it
hovered
over
lady
bateson
descended
to
this
protruded
leg
and
became
complacent
as
it
had
a
right
to
be
well
i
always
said
so
from
the
start
lady
bateson
announced
and
now
i
sure
of
it
i
do
mind
frenchmen
as
frenchmen
but
what
i
say
is
let
them
stick
to
their
that
is
the
side
of
them
which
in
my
somewhat
responsible
position
i
endeavour
to
humour
you
see
the
result
he
swept
his
hand
towards
the
painted
panels
one
thing
i
must
say
in
justice
to
my
charges
i
find
them
docile
dorothea
had
confidence
in
her
brother
tact
and
his
unerring
eye
for
his
audience
yet
she
looked
about
her
nervously
to
make
sure
that
of
the
few
prisoners
selected
for
invitation
to
the
ball
none
was
within
earshot
the
vicomte
de
tocqueville
a
stoical
young
patrician
had
chosen
a
partner
for
the
next
dance
and
was
leading
her
out
with
that
air
of
vacuity
with
which
he
revenged
himself
upon
the
passing
hour
of
misfortune
go
on
it
seemed
to
say
but
permit
me
to
remind
you
that
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
you
do
not
exist
old
general
rochambeau
and
old
de
in
worn
but
regimentals
patrolled
the
far
end
of
the
room
the
admiral
seemed
in
an
ill
humour
and
this
was
nothing
new
he
grumbled
at
everything
but
the
general
demeanour
as
he
trotted
up
and
down
beside
his
friend
doubtless
doing
his
best
to
pacify
him
betrayed
an
unwonted
agitation
it
occurred
to
dorothea
that
he
had
not
yet
greeted
her
and
paid
his
usual
compliment
miss
westcote
is
not
dancing
tonight
the
voice
was
at
her
elbow
and
she
looked
up
with
a
start
to
meet
the
gaze
of
raoul
excuse
me
she
wished
to
explain
why
she
had
been
startled
i
did
not
expect
to
see
me
here
it
appears
that
they
have
given
the
a
free
ticket
and
i
assume
that
it
carries
permission
to
dance
provided
he
does
not
display
in
an
unseemly
manner
the
patch
in
the
rear
of
his
best
tunic
he
turned
his
head
in
a
effort
to
stare
down
his
back
dorothea
admitted
to
herself
that
he
made
a
decidedly
handsome
fellow
in
his
blue
uniform
with
red
facings
and
corded
epaulettes
nor
does
a
uniform
look
any
the
worse
for
having
seen
a
moderate
amount
of
service
but
mademoiselle
was
in
a
what
do
you
call
it
a
brown
study
which
i
interrupted
i
was
wondering
why
general
rochambeau
had
not
yet
come
to
speak
with
me
i
can
account
for
it
perhaps
but
first
you
must
answer
my
question
mademoiselle
are
you
not
dancing
tonight
that
will
depend
sir
on
whether
i
am
asked
or
no
she
said
it
almost
archly
on
the
moment
impulse
and
the
words
out
felt
that
they
were
but
she
did
not
regret
them
when
her
eyes
met
his
he
was
offering
his
arm
and
she
found
herself
joining
in
his
laugh
a
happy
confidential
little
laugh
dorothea
cast
a
nervous
glance
towards
her
brother
but
endymion
back
was
turned
she
saw
that
her
partner
noted
the
look
and
she
nodded
towards
the
gallery
as
the
french
musicians
struck
into
a
jolly
jigging
step
with
a
crash
at
every
third
bar
cela
me
rend
she
murmured
do
you
know
the
air
it
the
of
lodi
and
we
are
to
dance
triumph
to
it
come
mademoiselle
since
the
is
nicely
mixed
let
your
captive
lead
you
those
were
days
of
reels
poussettes
ladies
chains
and
figure
dancing
honest
hopping
and
twisting
hands
across
and
down
the
middle
an
art
contemned
now
worse
than
neglected
insulted
by
the
vulgar
caricature
of
kitchen
lancers
but
then
seriously
practised
delighting
the
eye
bringing
blood
to
the
dancers
cheeks
for
five
minutes
and
more
dorothea
was
entirely
happy
raoul
himself
no
mean
performer
tasted
after
his
first
surprise
something
of
the
joy
of
discovery
who
could
have
guessed
that
this
quiet
spinster
who
as
a
rule
held
herself
and
walked
so
awkwardly
would
prove
the
best
partner
in
the
room
he
had
not
the
least
doubt
of
it
others
danced
with
more
abandonment
with
more
exuberant
vigour
romped
was
his
criticism
but
none
with
such
perfectly
restrained
covering
precision
with
grace
hands
across
cast
off
and
wheel
as
their
fingers
met
again
he
felt
the
tense
nerves
the
throb
of
the
pulse
beneath
the
glove
her
lips
were
parted
her
eyes
and
whole
face
animated
she
was
not
thinking
of
him
or
of
anyone
only
of
the
swing
and
beat
of
the
music
the
sway
of
life
and
colour
her
own
body
swaying
to
it
enslaved
to
the
moment
and
answering
no
other
call
i
understand
why
they
call
it
the
triumph
he
murmured
as
he
led
her
back
to
her
seat
she
turned
her
eyes
on
him
as
one
coming
out
of
a
dream
i
have
never
enjoyed
a
dance
so
much
in
my
life
she
said
seriously
he
laughed
it
must
have
been
an
inspiration
he
began
and
checked
himself
with
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
at
the
painted
panel
behind
them
you
were
saying
she
looked
up
after
a
moment
nothing
listen
to
the
he
drew
aside
one
of
the
orange
curtains
and
dorothea
heard
the
note
of
a
bell
clanging
in
a
distant
street
time
for
all
good
prisoners
to
be
in
bed
and
heaven
temper
the
wind
to
the
thin
blanket
it
is
snowing
snowing
furiously
do
they
suffer
much
in
these
winters
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
they
die
sometimes
though
your
brother
does
his
best
to
prevent
it
it
promises
to
be
a
hard
season
for
them
i
wish
i
could
help
but
endymion
my
brother
does
not
approve
of
ladies
mixing
themselves
up
in
these
affairs
yet
he
has
carried
off
to
the
where
at
a
side
table
three
of
my
compatriots
are
vending
to
add
a
little
beef
to
their
is
it
that
which
has
annoyed
general
rochambeau
she
had
recognised
the
phrase
but
let
it
pass
it
is
she
understood
for
some
reason
her
brain
was
unusually
clear
tonight
at
any
other
time
she
would
have
defended
or
at
least
excused
her
brother
she
knew
it
and
found
time
to
wonder
at
her
new
practicality
as
she
answered
i
must
think
of
some
way
to
help
she
saw
his
brow
clear
saw
that
had
risen
in
his
esteem
and
was
glad
to
you
mademoiselle
we
shall
find
it
easy
to
be
grateful
by
helping
them
she
explained
i
may
also
be
helping
my
brother
you
do
not
understand
him
as
i
do
and
you
sharpen
your
wit
upon
him
be
assured
it
does
not
hurt
him
mademoiselle
no
but
it
hurts
he
bowed
gravely
it
shall
not
hurt
you
again
whom
you
love
you
shall
protect
ah
m
raoul
endymion
westcote
hailed
him
from
the
doorway
and
crossed
the
room
with
narcissus
in
tow
my
brother
is
interested
in
your
panel
of
bacchus
and
ariadne
he
will
be
glad
to
discuss
it
with
you
he
shivered
i
have
been
down
to
the
door
and
it
is
snowing
viciously
some
of
our
friends
will
hardly
find
their
homes
tonight
i
hope
by
the
way
you
have
brought
a
raoul
ignored
the
question
i
fear
sir
your
learning
will
discover
mistakes
said
he
addressing
narcissus
and
leading
the
way
towards
the
panel
but
whilst
i
think
of
it
endymion
persisted
i
saw
old
baize
behind
the
door
do
hesitate
to
take
one
you
can
return
it
or
next
day
dorothea
being
his
only
audience
he
beamed
a
look
on
her
which
said
they
come
to
us
in
a
hurry
these
prisoners
no
time
to
collect
a
wardrobe
but
i
think
of
these
little
things
rest
assured
sir
i
will
turn
up
my
said
raoul
and
dorothea
could
see
him
a
moment
later
shaking
his
head
naturedly
though
the
commissary
still
protested
dorothea
left
to
herself
watched
them
examining
and
discussing
the
panel
of
bacchus
and
ariadne
the
orchestra
started
another
but
no
partner
approached
to
claim
her
the
dance
began
it
was
the
dashing
white
sergeant
and
one
exuberant
couple
threatened
to
tread
upon
her
toes
she
stood
up
and
for
lack
of
anything
better
to
do
began
to
study
the
panel
behind
her
a
moment
later
her
hand
went
up
to
her
throat
it
was
the
panel
on
which
raoul
had
sketched
an
imaginary
board
with
his
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
but
the
perseus
was
different
he
wore
the
face
of
raoul
himself
and
beneath
the
throat
of
the
nymph
on
the
right
half
concealed
in
the
folds
about
her
bosom
hung
a
locket
a
small
enamelled
heart
edged
with
brilliants
just
such
a
trinket
a
brooch
had
pinned
the
collar
of
her
close
habit
three
days
before
when
she
and
raoul
had
stood
together
discussing
the
panel
it
was
a
legacy
from
her
mother
hastily
she
put
out
a
hand
and
drew
the
edge
of
the
orange
curtain
over
nymph
and
locket
soon
after
supper
endymion
westcote
informed
his
sister
that
it
was
hopeless
to
think
of
returning
to
bayfield
the
barouche
would
convey
her
back
to
the
town
house
but
already
the
snow
lay
a
foot
and
a
half
deep
and
was
still
falling
he
himself
after
packing
her
off
with
narcissus
would
remain
and
attend
to
the
comfort
of
the
guests
many
of
whom
must
bivouac
at
the
dogs
for
the
night
as
best
they
could
at
midnight
or
a
little
later
the
barouche
was
announced
it
drew
up
close
to
the
porch
in
snow
upstairs
the
orchestra
was
sawing
out
the
strains
of
major
malley
reel
as
endymion
lifted
his
sister
in
and
slammed
the
door
upon
her
and
narcissus
the
noise
prevented
his
hearing
a
lifted
immediately
above
the
porch
right
away
the
who
had
accompanied
the
westcotes
turned
back
to
trim
a
candle
flaring
in
the
draughty
passage
but
it
so
happened
that
in
starting
the
coachman
entangled
his
in
the
endymion
in
his
polished
hessians
ran
round
to
unhitch
it
on
the
above
two
deft
hands
quickly
scooped
up
and
moulded
a
snowball
he
should
turn
up
his

endymion
westcote
did
not
hear
the
voice
but
as
the
vehicle
rolled
heavily
forward
out
of
the
darkness
a
snowball
struck
him

the
nape

found
when
she
stretched
out

hand
for
the

always
like
waking
in

one

the

managed
to
struggle
across
just
now
with

and
he
says
that
a

of
them
could
get
beds
in

for
love
or

kept
it
up

dorothea
laughed
they
were
caught
like
this
just
eighteen
years
ago
let
me
see
yes
just
eighteen
i
remember
because
it
was
my
second
ball
but
then
there
were
no
prisoners
filling
up
the
lodgings
so
everyone
found
a
room
some
of
the
french
gentlemen
gave
up
their
lodgings
last
night
and
are
down
at
dogs
now
keeping
themselves

there

as

and
laughed
she
was
herself
but
had
seen
service
in
bath
where
is
mr
endymion
i
heard
him
let
himself
in
just
as
i
was
going
upstairs
after
undressing
you
that
would
be
about
one
or
a
quarter
past
but
he
was
up
again
at
six
called
for
morrish
to
heat
his
shaving
water
and
had
a
cup
of
coffee
in
his
room
he
and
narcissus
have
gone
out
to
see
the
roll
called
and
get
the
volunteers
and
prisoners
to
clear
the
streets
leastways
that
what
narcissus
is
doing
i
heard
endymion
say
something
about
riding
off
to
see
what
the
roads
are
like
by
this
time
the
fire
was
lit
and
crackling
polly
loitered
awhile
arranging
the
cinders
she
had
given
up
asking
with
whom
her
mistress
had
danced
but
dorothea
usually
described
the
more
striking
gowns
and
how
this
or
that
lady
had
worn
her
hair
tired
miss
well
yes
polly
a
little
but
not
uncomfortably
i
danced
several
times
last
night
polly
pursed
her
mouth
into
an
o
but
her
face
was
turned
to
the
fire
and
dorothea
did
not
see
it
i
hope
miss
you
tell
me
about
it
later
on
but
morrish
is
downstairs
declaring
that
no
hen
will
lay
an
egg
in
this
weather
to
have
it
snowed
up
the
next
moment
that
i
blame
mun
she
says
i
would
do
it
myself
here
polly
giggled
what
to
find
for
breakfast
she
do
know
and
never
will
until
i
go
and
help
her
polly
departed
leaving
her
mistress
cosy
in
bed
and
strangely
reluctant
to
rise
and
part
company
with
her
waking
thoughts
yes
dorothea
had
danced
twice
again
with
raoul
since
her
discovery
of
his
boldness
he
had
seen
her
draw
the
orange
curtain
over
his
offence
had
sought
her
again
and
apologised
for
it
he
had
done
it
he
had
pleaded
on
a
sudden
impulse
to
be
a
reminder
of
one
kind
glance
which
had
brightened
his
exile
one
but
she
was
in
the
least
likely
to
recognise
the
trinket
in
any
case
he
would
paint
it
out
at
the
first
opportunity
and
dorothea
had
forgiven
him
she
herself
had
a
great
capacity
for
gratitude
and
understood
the
feeling
far
too
thoroughly
to
believe
for
an
instant
that
raoul
could
be
mightily
grateful
for
anything
she
had
said
or
done
no
whatever
the
feeling
which
impels
a
young
gentleman
to
secrete
some
little
private
reminder
of
its
object
it
is
not
gratitude
and
dorothea
rejoiced
inwardly
that
it
was
not
but
what
then
was
it
some
attraction
of
sympathy
no
doubt
to
find
herself
attractive
in
any
way
was
a
new
experience
and
delightful
she
had
forgiven
him
on
the
spot
and
afterwards
they
had
danced
twice
together
and
he
had
praised
her
dancing
also
he
had
said
something
about
a
pretty
foot
but
frenchmen
must
always
be
complimenting
a
noise
in
the
street
interrupted
her
thoughts
and
reminded
her
that
she
must
not
be
dawdling
longer
in
bed
she
shut
her
teeth
made
a
leap
for
it
and
running
to
the
window
peered
over
the
blind
some
score
of
the
prisoners
in
a
gang
were
clearing
the
pavement
with
shovels
and
brushes
laughing
and
chattering
all
the
while
and
breaking
off
to
pelt
each
other
with
snowballs
she
had
discussed
these
poor
fellows
with
raoul
last
night
could
she
not
in
some
way
add
to
their
comfort
or
their
pleasure
he
had
dwelt
most
upon
their
mental
weariness
especially
on
sundays
of
material
discomfort
they
never
complained
but
they
dreaded
sundays
worse
than
they
dreaded
cold
weather
any
small
distraction
now
the
train
of
her
recollections
came
to
a
sudden
halt
before
a
tall
standing
at
an
obtuse
angle
to
the
fireplace
and
on
the
edge
of
its
broad
hearthrug
she
had
been
moving
aimlessly
from
the
window
to
the
wardrobe
in
which
polly
had
folded
and
laid
away
her
last
night
finery
and
from
the
wardrobe
back
to
a
long
sofa
at
the
bed
foot
and
now
she
found
herself
standing
before
the
glass
and
holding
her
nightgown
high
enough
to
display
a
foot
and
ankle
on
which
she
had
slipped
an
stocking
and
shoe
a
tide
of
red
flooded
her
neck
and
face
morrish
had
laid
the
meal
in
the
room
once
a
library
but
now
used
as
a
yet
still
preserving
the
d
ignified
aspect
of
a
private
room
for
banking
as
the
westcote
clients
were
reminded
by
several
sporting
prints
and
a
bust
of
the
medicean
venus
was
in
those
days
of
scarce
money
a
branch
of
philanthropy
rather
than
of
trade
the
good
caretaker
was
in
tears
over
the
breakfast
and
i
sure
miss
i
do
know
what
to
be
done
unless
you
can
eat
bacon
which
i
can
dorothea
assured
her
well
miss
i
am
sure
i
envy
you
for
ever
since
that
poor
french
captain
fioupi
hanged
himself
from
mary
odling
two
years
ago
the
first
of
this
very
next
month
i
have
been
able
to
look
at
a
bit
poor
gentleman
why
did
he
do
it
the
lord
knows
miss
but
they
said
it
was
from
the
street
came
the
voices
of
captain
fioupi
compatriots
merry
at
their
work
dorothea
had
scarcely
begun
breakfast
before
her
brothers
entered
and
she
had
to
pour
out
tea
for
them
narcissus
took
his
seat
at
once
endymion
stood
stamping
his
feet
and
warming
his
hands
by
the
fire
he
bent
and
with
his
finger
flicked
out
a
crust
of
snow
from
between
his
breeches
and
the
tops
of
his
it
fell
on
the
hearthstone
and
sputtered
the
roads
he
announced
are
not
very
bad
beyond
the
bridge
that
is
the
worst
spot
and
i
have
sent
down
a
gang
to
clear
it
our
guests
ought
to
be
able
to
depart
before
noon
though
i
wo
answer
for
the
road
yeovil
way
one
carrier
allworthy
has
come
through
to
the
bridge
but
says
he
passed
solomon
van
in
a
drift
about
four
miles
back
this
side
of
the
cheriton
oak
he
reports
bayfield
hill
safe
enough
but
that
i
discovered
for
myself
it
seems
quite
a
treat
for
them
dorothea
remarked
his
eyebrows
went
up
the
guests
do
you
mean
he
turned
to
the
fire
and
picked
up
the
tongs
she
laughed
no
i
mean
the
prisoners
i
was
listening
to
their
voices
just
now
they
were
throwing
snowballs
endymion
dropped
the
tongs
with
a
clatter
picked
them
up
set
them
in
place
and
faced
the
room
again
with
a
flush
which
might
have
come
from
stooping
over
the
fire
come
to
breakfast
dear
said
dorothea
busy
with
the
i
have
a
small
plan
i
want
your
permission
for
and
your
help
it
is
about
the
prisoners
general
rochambeau
and
raoul
are
doubtless
prepared
to
teach
me
my
business
snapped
endymion
who
seemed
in
bad
humour
this
morning
no
but
listen
dear
they
praise
you
warmly
for
whom
but
my
brother
would
these
poor
men
have
worked
as
they
did
upon
the
orange
room
and
all
to
show
their
gratitude
but
it
appears
the
worst
part
of
captivity
is
its
tedium
and
the
way
it
depresses
the
mind
one
sees
that
it
must
be
they
dread
sundays
most
of
all
and
i
said
i
would
speak
to
you
and
if
any
way
could
be
found
my
dear
dorothea
endymion
slipped
his
hands
beneath
his
and
stood
astraddle
i
have
not
often
to
request
you
to
mind
your
own
affairs
but
really
when
it
comes
to
making
a
promise
in
my
name
not
a
promise
may
i
ask
you
if
you
seriously
propose
to
familiarise
axcester
with
all
the
orgies
of
a
continental
sabbath
already
the
prisoners
spend
sunday
in
playing
chess
draughts
cards
dominoes
practices
which
i
connive
at
only
insisting
that
they
are
kept
out
of
sight
but
from
which
i
endeavour
to
wean
them
those
at
least
who
have
a
taste
for
music
by
encouraging
them
to
take
part
in
our
church
services
but
i
have
heard
you
regret
dear
that
only
the
least
respectable
fall
in
with
this
the
rest
being
strict
roman
catholics
think
it
wrong
are
you
quite
sure
last
night
did
not
you
you
are
certainly
disposed
to
be
argumentative
this
morning
i
think
suggested
narcissus
buttering
his
toast
carefully
you
might
at
least
hear
what
dorothea
has
to
say
oh
certainly
indeed
if
she
has
been
committing
me
to
her
projects
i
have
a
right
to
know
the
worst
i
have
committed
you
i
only
said
i
would
ask
your
advice
poor
dorothea
stammered
and
i
have
no
project
she
caught
narcissus
eye
and
went
on
a
little
more
firmly
only
i
thought
perhaps
that
if
you
extended
their
walks
a
little
on
sundays
they
are
scrupulous
in
keeping
their
and
once
in
a
way
we
might
entertain
them
at
bayfield
late
in
the
afternoon
when
you
have
finished
your
sunday
nap
narcissus
might
show
them
the
pavement
and
tell
them
about
vespasian
not
a
regular
lecture
it
being
sunday
but
an
informal
talk
with
tea
afterwards
and
in
the
evening
perhaps
they
might
meet
in
the
orange
room
for
some
sacred
music
it
need
not
be
called
a
dorothea
stopped
short
amazed
at
her
own
inventiveness
h
i
envy
your
simplicity
my
dear
soul
in
believing
that
the
ah
alleged
of
these
men
can
he
cured
by
a
talk
about
vespasian
but
when
you
go
on
to
talk
of
sacred
music
i
must
be
permitted
to
remind
you
that
a
concert
is
none
the
less
a
concert
for
being
called
by
another
name
we
britons
do
not
usually
allow
names
to
disguise
facts
a
concert
call
it
even
a
concert
in
the
orange
room
amid
those
distinctly
ah
pagan
adornments
i
can
scarcely
even
term
it
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
so
clearly
can
i
see
it
paving
the
way
for
other
questionable
indulgences
i
do
doubt
your
good
intentions
dorothea
but
you
can
not
as
a
woman
be
expected
to
understand
how
easily
the
best
intentions
may
convert
axcester
with
its
french
community
into
a
veritable
of
vice
and
you
might
tell
morrish
i
shall
want
the
horse
again
in
time
dorothea
left
the
room
on
her
errand
as
she
closed
the
door
narcissus
looked
up
from
his
toast
of
fiddlesticks
said
he
i
ah
beg
your
pardon
endymion
in
the
act
of
seating
himself
at
table
paused
to
stare
of
fiddlesticks
repeated
narcissus
you
need
have
snapped
dorothea
head
off
i
thought
her
suggestions
extremely
sensible
the
concert
for
instance
yes
you
do
make
sacred
music
irreverent
by
calling
it
a
concert
moreover
i
really
do
see
why
as
intelligent
men
they
should
not
find
vespasian
interesting
his
career
in
many
respects
resembled
the
corsican
endymion
smiled
at
his
plate
well
well
we
will
talk
about
it
later
on
said
he
he
never
quarrelled
with
narcissus
whose
foibles
amused
him
but
for
whose
slow
judgment
he
had
a
more
than
brotherly
respect
the
westcotes
though
at
due
intervals
and
with
due
notice
given
they
entertained
as
handsomely
as
the
lord
lieutenant
himself
were
not
a
household
to
be
bounced
so
to
speak
into
promiscuous
or
extemporised
hospitality
for
an
ordinary
dorothea
would
pen
the
invitations
three
weeks
ahead
endymion
devote
an
hour
to
selecting
his
guests
and
narcissus
spend
a
morning
in
the
bayfield
cellar
which
he
supervised
and
in
which
he
took
a
just
pride
and
so
well
was
this
inelasticity
recognised
so
clearly
was
it
understood
that
by
no
circumstances
could
endymion
westcote
permit
himself
to
be
upset
that
none
of
the
company
at
the
dogs
thought
a
bit
the
worse
of
him
for
having
gone
home
and
left
them
to
shift
as
best
they
could
dorothea
when
at
about
ten
she
put
on
her
bonnet
and
cloak
and
stepped
down
to
visit
them
the
prisoners
having
by
that
time
cleared
the
pavement
found
herself
surrounded
by
a
crew
humorously
apologetic
for
their
toilettes
profoundly
envious
of
her
better
luck
but
on
excellent
terms
with
one
another
and
the
younger
ones
at
any
rate
who
had
borne
the
worst
of
the
discomfort
enjoying
the
adventure
thoroughly
but
the
life
and
soul
of
it
all
was
that
raoul
confessed
lady
bateson
niece
by
george
echoed
the
schoolboy
who
had
danced
the
soldier
joy
with
dorothea
i
would
have
believed
it
of
a
frenchy
for
some
reason
dorothea
was
not
too
well
pleased
but
i
do
not
see
m
raoul
oh
he
down
by
the
bridge
helping
the
relief
party
one
would
guess
him
worn
out
he
ran
from
lodging
to
lodging
turning
the
occupants
out
of
their
beds
and
routing
about
for
fresh
linen
they
say
he
even
carried
old
kekewich
through
the
snow
and
tucked
her
in
bed
added
the
schoolboy
and
then
he
came
back
wet
almost
to
the
waist
and
danced
he
looked
roguishly
at
lady
bateson
niece
and
the
pair
exploded
in
laughter
they
ran
off
as
general
rochambeau
jaded
and
unshaven
approached
and
saluted
dorothea
until
miss
westcote
appeared
we
held
our
own
against
the
face
of
day
now
alas
the
conspiracy
can
no
longer
be
kept
up
you
had
no
compliment
for
me
last
night
general
forgive
me
mademoiselle
he
lowered
his
voice
and
spoke
earnestly
i
have
a
genuine
one
for
you
i
compliment
your
heart
raoul
has
told
me
of
your
interest
in
our
poor
compatriots
and
what
you
intend
i
fear
i
can
do
little
dorothea
interrupted
mindful
of
her
late
encounter
and
as
she
believed
defeat
by
all
accounts
raoul
appears
to
have
made
himself
agreeable
to
all
she
added
the
old
gentleman
chuckled
and
took
snuff
he
loves
an
audience
at
about
four
in
the
morning
when
all
the
elders
were
in
bed
pardon
me
mademoiselle
if
i
claim
to
reckon
myself
among
my
poor
back
tells
me
at
what
cost
at
about
four
in
the
morning
the
young
lady
who
has
just
left
you
spoke
of
a
new
dance
she
had
seen
performed
this
season
at
bath
well
it
appears
that
raoul
had
also
seen
it
a
valtz
they
called
it
or
some
such
name
whereupon
nothing
would
do
but
they
must
dance
it
together
such
a
dance
mademoiselle
roll
roll
round
and
round
roll
roll
but
you
understand
the
others
began
to
copy
them
and
someone
asked
raoul
where
he
had
found
this
accomplishment
in
my
travels
says
he
and
points
to
one
of
the
panels
and
there
if
you
will
believe
me
the
fellow
had
actually
painted
himself
as
perseus
in
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
poor
dorothea
glanced
towards
the
panel
ah
you
remember
it
but
he
must
have
painted
in
the
face
after
showing
it
to
us
the
other
day
or
i
should
have
recognised
it
at
the
time
you
must
come
and
see
it
really
an
excellent
portrait
he
led
her
towards
it
the
orange
curtain
no
longer
hid
the
third
nymph
but
the
blood
which
had
left
dorothea
face
rushed
back
as
she
saw
that
the
trinket
had
been
roughly
erased
it
was
quite
a
but
raoul
loves
an
audience
shortly
before
noon
the
road
by
the
bridge
was
reported
to
be
clear
carriages
were
announced
and
the
guests
shook
hands
and
were
rolled
away
the
elder
glum
their
juniors
in
boisterous
spirits
as
each
carriage
passed
the
bridge
where
raoul
stood
among
the
workmen
handkerchiefs
fluttered
out
and
he
lifted
his
hat
gaily
in
response
chapter
v
begins
with
ancient
history
and
ends
with
an
old
story
vicit
romanus
where
the
roman
conquered
he
settled
and
it
is
from
his
settlements
that
we
deduce
his
conquests
of
vespasian
and
his
second
legion
the
jejune
page
of
suetonius
records
neither
where
they
landed
nor
at
what
limit
their
victorious
eagles
were
stayed
yet
will
the
patient
investigator
trace
their
footprints
across
many
a
familiar
landscape
of
rural
england
led
by
the
blurred
imperishable
impress
he
has
learned
to
recognise
the
invading
host
sweeps
forward
and
is
gone
but
behind
it
the
homestead
arises
and
smiles
upon
the
devastated
fields
arms
yield
to
the
implements
and
habiliments
of
peace
and
the
colonist
who
supersedes
the
legionary
in
time
furnishes
the
sole
evidence
of
his
feverish
and
ensanguined
transit
narcissus
was
enjoying
himself
amazingly
his
audience
endured
him
because
the
experience
was
new
and
their
ears
caught
the
rattle
of
in
the
adjoining
library
dorothea
sat
counting
her
guests
and
assuring
herself
that
the
number
of
teacups
would
suffice
she
had
heard
the
lecture
many
times
before
and
with
repetition
its
sonorous
periods
had
lost
hold
upon
her
although
her
brother
had
been
at
pains
to
model
them
upon
gibbon
but
the
scene
impressed
her
sharply
and
she
carried
away
a
very
lively
picture
of
it
the
old
roman
villa
had
been
built
about
a
hollow
square
open
to
the
sky
and
this
square
now
formed
the
great
hall
of
bayfield
deep
galleries
of
two
stories
surrounded
it
in
place
of
the
old
colonnaded
walk
out
of
these
opened
the
principal
rooms
of
the
house
and
above
them
upon
a
circular
lantern
of
clear
glass
was
arched
a
painted
dome
sheathed
on
the
outside
with
green
copper
and
surmounted
by
a
gilt
ball
this
dome
which
could
be
seen
from
the
axcester
high
street
when
winter
stripped
the
bayfield
elms
gave
the
building
something
of
the
appearance
of
an
observatory
on
the
north
side
of
the
hall
a
broad
staircase
descended
from
the
gallery
to
the
tiled
floor
in
the
midst
of
which
a
fountain
played
beneath
a
cupola
supported
by
slender
columns
on
the
west
the
recess
beneath
the
gallery
had
been
deepened
to
admit
a
truly
ample
fireplace
with
a
flat
hearthstone
and
andirons
here
were
screens
and
rich
turkey
rugs
and
here
the
bayfield
household
ordinarily
had
the
lamps
set
after
dinner
and
gathered
before
the
fire
talking
little
enjoying
the
long
pauses
filled
with
the
hiss
of
logs
and
the
monotonous
drip
and
trickle
of
water
in
the
penumbra
the
prisoners
two
hundred
in
all
crowded
the
floor
the
stairs
even
the
deep
gallery
above
but
on
the
south
side
facing
the
staircase
two
heavy
curtains
had
been
looped
back
from
the
atrium
and
there
a
ray
of
wintry
sunshine
fell
through
the
glass
roof
upon
the
famous
bayfield
pavement
and
the
figure
of
narcissus
gravely
expounding
it
he
had
reached
his
peroration
and
dorothea
who
knew
every
word
of
it
by
heart
was
on
the
alert
at
its
close
the
audience
held
their
breath
for
a
second
or
two
and
then
satisfied
as
their
hostess
rose
that
he
had
really
come
to
an
end
tendered
their
applause
and
breaking
into
promiscuous
chatter
trooped
towards
the
narcissus
lingered
with
bent
head
oblivious
silently
repeating
the
last
worn
sentences
while
he
conned
his
beloved
tessellae
a
voice
aroused
him
from
his
brown
study
he
looked
up
to
find
the
hall
deserted
and
raoul
standing
at
his
elbow
will
you
remember
your
promise
monsieur
and
allow
me
to
examine
a
little
more
closely
ah
but
it
is
wonderful
that
pentheus
and
the
maenad
there
carrying
the
torn
limb
also
the
border
of
and
crossed
thyrsi
though
that
to
be
sure
is
usual
enough
and
this
next
ah
i
remember
cum
parentis
regna
per
but
what
a
devil
of
a
design
and
above
all
what
mellowness
you
will
i
know
pardon
the
enthusiasm
of
one
who
comes
from
the
provence
a
few
miles
out
of
arles
and
whose
mother
family
boasts
itself
to
be
descended
from
roman
colonists
narcissus
beamed
to
you
then
raoul
after
your
forum
and
famous
amphitheatre
our
pavement
must
seem
a
poor
trifle
though
it
by
no
means
exhausts
our
list
of
interesting
remains
the
praefurnium
for
instance
i
must
show
you
our
praefurnium
the
house
would
be
remarkable
anywhere
even
in
my
own
provence
so
closely
has
it
kept
the
original
lines
in
one
could
reconstruct
ay
chimed
in
the
delighted
narcissus
you
shall
try
raoul
you
shall
try
i
promise
to
catch
you
tripping
yonder
runs
the
fosse
way
west
by
south
the
villa
stands
about
two
hundred
yards
back
from
it
facing
the
a
little
east
of
south
the
outer
walls
did
not
run
exactly
true
with
the
enclosed
quadrangle
you
say
that
the
front
measured
two
hundred
feet
perhaps
a
little
over
clearly
then
it
was
a
domain
of
much
importance
and
the
granaries
mills
stables
slaves
dwellings
would
occupy
much
space
about
it
an
acre
and
a
half
at
least
portions
of
a
brick
foundation
were
unearthed
no
less
than
three
hundred
yards
away
a
hypocaust
lay
embedded
among
them
much
broken
but
recognisable
what
puzzles
me
mused
raoul
is
how
these
southern
settlers
managed
to
endure
the
climate
but
that
is
explicable
narcissus
was
off
now
in
full
cry
the
trees
my
dear
sir
the
trees
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
our
bayfield
elms
are
the
ragged
survivors
of
an
immense
forest
a
forest
which
covered
the
whole
primaeval
face
of
somerset
on
this
side
of
the
fens
and
through
which
vespasian
literally
hewed
their
way
given
these
forests
which
by
the
way
extended
over
the
greater
part
of
england
we
must
infer
a
climate
totally
unlike
ours
of
this
present
day
damper
perhaps
but
milder
within
his
belt
of
trees
the
colonist
secure
from
the
prevailing
winds
would
plant
a
garden
to
rival
your
gardens
of
the
south
vere
rosam
atque
autumno
carpere
poma
yes
added
raoul
taking
fire
and
perhaps
a
plant
of
helichryse
or
a
from
paestum
to
twine
about
the
pillars
and
comfort
his
exile
m
raoul
dorothea
voice
interrupted
them
she
stood
by
the
looped
curtain
and
reproached
narcissus
with
a
look
he
has
had
no
tea
yet
it
was
cruel
of
you
to
detain
him
my
brother
sir
she
turned
to
raoul
has
no
conscience
when
once
set
going
on
his
hobby
for
of
course
you
were
discussing
the
pavement
we
were
talking
mademoiselle
at
that
moment
of
the
things
which
brighten
and
comfort
exile
she
lowered
her
eyes
conscious
of
a
blush
and
half
angry
that
it
would
not
be
restrained
and
i
was
talking
of
tea
if
that
happens
to
be
one
of
them
she
replied
forcing
a
laugh
well
well
said
narcissus
take
raoul
away
and
give
him
his
tea
but
he
must
come
with
me
afterwards
while
there
is
light
and
we
will
go
over
the
site
together
i
must
fetch
my
map
he
hurried
across
the
hall
come
raoul
said
dorothea
stepping
past
her
guest
and
leading
the
way
by
a
small
detour
we
can
reach
that
end
of
the
library
which
is
least
crowded
he
followed
without
lifting
his
eyes
apparently
lost
in
thought
the
atrium
on
this
side
opened
on
a
corridor
which
crossed
the
front
door
and
was
closed
by
a
door
at
either
end
the
one
admitting
to
the
service
rooms
the
other
to
the
library
flat
columns
relieved
the
blank
wall
of
this
passage
with
monstrous
copies
of
raphael
cartoons
filling
the
interspaces
on
the
other
hand
four
tall
windows
two
on
either
side
of
the
door
looked
out
upon
the
the
avenue
and
the
rolling
hills
beyond
axcester
by
one
of
these
windows
raoul
halted
and
dorothea
halted
too
slightly
puzzled
ah
mademoiselle
but
there
is
one
thing
your
brother
forgets
what
became
of
his
happy
colonists
in
the
end
he
told
us
that
early
in
the
fifth
century
the
emperor
honorius
was
it
not
withdrew
his
legions
and
wrote
that
britain
must
henceforth
look
after
itself
i
listened
for
the
end
of
the
story
but
your
brother
did
not
supply
it
yet
sooner
or
later
one
and
the
same
dreadful
fate
must
have
overtaken
all
these
pleasant
scattered
homes
sack
and
fire
and
slaughter
slaughter
for
all
the
men
for
the
women
slavery
and
worse
does
one
hear
of
any
surviving
out
of
this
warm
life
into
silence
he
paused
and
shivered
very
likely
they
did
not
guess
for
a
long
while
look
mademoiselle
at
the
fosse
way
stretching
yonder
across
the
hills
figure
yourself
a
daughter
of
the
old
roman
homestead
standing
here
and
watching
the
little
cloud
of
dust
that
meant
the
retreating
column
the
last
of
your
protection
you
would
not
guess
what
it
meant
you
to
whom
each
day
has
brought
its
restful
round
who
have
lived
only
to
be
good
and
reflect
the
sunshine
upon
all
near
you
and
i
your
slave
suppose
me
standing
beside
you
might
guess
as
little
he
took
a
step
and
touched
her
hand
his
face
was
still
turned
to
the
window
time
time
he
went
on
in
a
low
voice
charged
with
passion
it
eats
us
all
brr
how
i
hate
it
how
i
hate
the
grave
there
lies
the
sting
mademoiselle
the
torture
to
be
a
captive
to
feel
one
best
days
slipping
away
and
fate
still
denying
to
us
poor
devils
the
chance
which
even
the
luckiest
god
knows
find
little
enough
he
laughed
and
to
dorothea
the
laugh
sounded
passing
bitter
you
will
not
understand
how
a
man
feels
how
even
so
unimportant
a
creature
as
i
must
bear
a
sort
of
personal
grudge
against
his
fate
i
am
trying
to
understand
said
dorothea
gently
but
this
you
can
understand
how
a
prisoner
loves
the
sunshine
not
because
through
his
grating
it
warms
him
but
because
it
is
the
sunshine
and
he
sees
it
mademoiselle
i
am
not
grateful
i
see
merely
and
adore
some
day
you
shall
pause
by
this
window
and
see
a
cloud
of
dust
on
the
fosse
way
the
last
of
us
prisoners
as
they
march
us
from
axcester
to
the
place
of
our
release
and
seeing
it
you
shall
close
the
book
upon
a
chapter
but
not
without
remembering
he
touched
her
hand
again
but
now
his
fingers
closed
on
it
and
he
raised
it
to
his
lips
not
without
remembering
how
and
when
one
frenchman
said
bless
you
mademoiselle
dorothea
dorothea
eyes
were
wet
when
a
moment
later
narcissus
came
bustling
through
the
atrium
with
a
roll
of
papers
in
his
hand
ah
this
is
luck
he
cried
i
was
starting
to
search
for
you
he
either
assumed
that
they
had
visited
the
or
forgot
all
about
it
and
raoul
look
implored
dorothea
not
to
explain
suppose
we
take
the
first
on
the
north
side
of
the
house
that
sir
will
tell
you
whether
i
am
right
or
wrong
about
the
climate
of
those
days
a
summer
parlour
facing
north
and
with
no
trace
of
he
led
off
his
captive
and
dorothea
heard
his
expository
tones
gather
volume
as
the
pair
crossed
the
great
hall
beneath
the
dome
then
she
turned
the
handle
of
the
library
door
and
was
instantly
deafened
by
the
babel
within
the
guests
took
their
departure
a
little
before
sunset
raoul
was
not
among
the
long
train
which
shook
hands
with
her
and
filed
down
the
avenue
at
the
heels
of
de
tocqueville
and
general
rochambeau
twenty
minutes
later
while
the
servants
were
setting
the
hall
in
order
she
heard
her
brother
voice
beneath
the
window
of
her
boudoir
explaining
the
system
on
which
the
romans
warmed
their
houses
she
had
picked
up
a
religious
book
but
found
herself
unable
to
fix
her
attention
upon
it
or
even
to
sit
still
her
hand
still
burned
where
raoul
lips
had
touched
it
she
recalled
endymion
prophecy
that
these
entertainments
would
throw
the
domestic
mechanism
always
more
delicately
poised
on
sundays
than
on
weekdays
completely
oft
its
pivot
she
had
pledged
herself
to
prevent
this
and
had
made
a
private
appeal
to
the
maidservants
with
whose
they
interfered
they
had
responded
loyally
still
this
was
the
first
experiment
she
would
go
down
to
the
hall
again
and
make
sure
that
the
couches
were
in
position
the
cushions
shaken
up
the
placed
around
the
fountain
so
accurately
that
endymion
nice
eye
for
small
comforts
could
detect
no
excuse
for
saying
i
told
you
so
as
she
passed
along
the
gallery
her
eyes
sought
the
pillar
beside
which
raoul
had
stood
during
the
lecture
by
the
foot
of
it
a
book
lay
face
downwards
a
book
cheaply
bound
between
boards
of
mottled
paper
she
picked
it
up
and
read
the
title
it
was
a
volume
of
confessions
a
book
of
which
she
remembered
to
have
heard
on
the
flyleaf
was
written
the
owner
name
in
full
charles
marie
fabien
de
raoul
dorothea
hurried
downstairs
with
it
and
past
the
servants
tidying
the
hall
she
looked
to
find
raoul
still
buttonholed
and
held
captive
by
narcissus
at
the
eastern
angle
of
the
house
but
before
she
reached
the
front
door
she
happened
though
perhaps
it
was
not
quite
accidental
to
throw
a
glance
through
the
window
by
which
he
had
stood
and
talked
with
her
and
saw
him
striding
away
down
the
avenue
in
the
dusk
she
returned
to
her
room
and
summoned
polly
you
know
raoul
he
has
left
forgetting
this
book
which
belongs
to
him
run
down
to
the
small
gate
that
a
good
girl
you
will
overtake
him
easily
since
he
is
walking
round
by
the
avenue
and
return
it
with
my
compliments
polly
picked
up
her
skirts
and
ran
a
narrow
path
slanted
down
across
the
slope
of
the
park
to
the
nurseries
a
sheltered
corner
in
which
the
bayfield
gardener
grew
his
more
delicate
evergreens
and
here
a
small
opened
on
the
high
road
the
gate
stood
many
feet
above
the
road
which
descended
the
hill
between
steep
hedges
she
heard
raoul
footstep
as
she
reached
it
and
peering
over
saw
him
before
he
caught
sight
of
her
indeed
he
had
almost
passed
when
she
hailed
him
holloa
he
swung
almost
rightabout
and
smiled
up
pleasantly
is
it
highway
robbery
if
so
i
surrender
polly
laughed
showing
a
fine
set
of
teeth
i
out
of
breath
she
answered
you
left
your
book
behind
and
my
mistress
sent
it
after
you
with
her
compliments
she
held
it
above
the
gate
he
sprang
up
the
bank
towards
her
and
a
pretty
book
too
to
be
found
in
your
hands
you
have
been
reading
it
i
hope
la
no
is
it
wicked
much
depends
on
where
you
happen
to
open
it
now
if
your
sweetheart
who
told
you
i
had
one
what
his
name
well
if
you
must
know
i
walking
out
with
corporal
zeally
but
what
are
you
doing
to
the
book
for
raoul
had
taken
out
a
penknife
and
was
slicing
out
page
after
page
in
some
places
whole
blocks
of
pages
together
when
i
finished
i
going
to
ask
you
to
take
it
back
to
your
mistress
and
then
no
doubt
you
be
reading
it
on
the
sly
here
i
must
sit
down
suppose
you
let
me
perch
myself
on
the
top
bar
of
the
gate
also
it
would
be
kind
of
you
to
put
up
an
arm
and
prevent
my
overbalancing
i
should
think
of
it
oh
very
well
he
climbed
up
laid
the
book
on
his
knee
and
went
on
slicing
i
particularly
want
her
to
read
rousseau
reflections
on
the
pont
du
gard
but
i
do
seem
to
have
a
book
marker
unless
you
lend
me
a
lock
of
your
hair
were
you
the
gentleman
she
danced
with
at
dogs
the
night
of
the
snowstorm
the
pont
du
gard
my
dear
is
a
roman
antiquity
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
dancing
if
as
i
suppose
you
refer
to
the
de
lodi
that
is
a
totally
different
work
of
art
i
sure
i
do
know
what
you
mean
and
i
do
intend
that
you
shall
he
cut
a
small
strip
of
braid
from
his
coat
inserted
it
for
a
bookmarker
and
began
to
fold
away
the
excised
pages
that
why
i
am
keeping
these
back
for
my
own
perusal
and
perhaps
corporal
zeally
do
you
know
him
she
reached
up
to
take
the
book
he
was
holding
out
in
his
left
hand
and
the
next
instant
his
right
arm
was
round
her
neck
and
he
had
kissed
her
full
on
the
lips
oh
you
wretch
she
cried
breaking
free
and
laughed
next
moment
as
he
nearly
toppled
off
the
gate

him
why
of
course
i
do
raoul
was
reseating
himself
on
his
perch
when
he
happened
to
throw
a
look
down
into
the
road
and
at
once
broke
into
immoderate
laughter
talk
of
the
wolf
polly
screamed
and
ran
below
at
a
bend
of
the
road
stood
a
stoutish
figure
in
the
uniform
of
the
axcester
volunteers
scarlet
with
white
facings
it
was
corporal
zeally
very
slowly
taking
in
the
scene
raoul
skipped
off
the
gate
and
stepped
briskly
past
him
evening
corporal
we
both
of
us
a
little
behind
time
this
evening
said
he
as
he
went
by
the
corporal
pivoted
on
his
heels
and
stared
after
him
dang
my
living
buttons
he
said
reflectively
could
even
wait
till
my
back
was
turned
but
must
kiss
the
maid
under
my
nose
he
paused
and
rubbed
his
chin
her
looked
like
polly
and
her
zounded
like
polly
dang
this
dimpsey
old
light
i
got
a
good
mind
to
run
and
who
was
he
took
a
step
down
the
hill
but
thought
better
of
it
no
i
wo
he
said
i
go
and
ax
polly
chapter
vi
fate
in
a
laurelled
all
the
tongues
of
rumour
agreed
that
the
bayfield
entertainment
had
been
a
success
and
endymion
westcote
received
many
congratulations
upon
it
at
the
next
meeting
of
magistrates
nonsense
nonsense
he
protested
lightly
one
must
do
something
to
make
life
more
tolerable
to
the
poor
devils
and
my
word
was
worth
it
to
see
their
gratitude
they
behaved
admirably
you
see
thirds
of
them
are
gentlemen
after
a
fashion
not
perhaps
quite
in
the
sense
in
which
we
understand
the
word
but
then
the
ah
modicum
of
french
blood
in
my
veins
counteracts
i
dare
say
some
little
insular
prejudices
my
dear
fellow
about
such
men
as
de
tocqueville
and
rochambeau
there
can
be
no
possible
question
ah
i
extremely
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
i
feared
perhaps
the
way
they
managed
their
not
at
all
i
was
thinking
rather
of
your
bold
attitude
towards
sunday
observance
what
does
milliton
say
endymion
eyebrows
went
up
milliton
was
the
vicar
of
axcester
and
the
living
lay
in
the
westcotes
gift
i
am
not
ah
aware
that
i
consulted
milliton
on
such
questions
i
recognise
no
responsibility
save
to
my
own
conscience
he
has
not
been
complaining
i
trust
not
to
my
knowledge
ah
endymion
looked
as
if
milliton
had
better
not
i
take
you
must
know
a
somewhat
broad
view
on
such
matters
may
i
without
offence
term
it
a
liberal
one
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
intend
going
yet
farther
in
the
direction
and
granting
permission
for
a
small
reunion
on
sunday
evenings
at
dogs
when
selections
of
purely
sacred
music
will
be
performed
i
shall
of
course
deprecate
the
name
and
even
may
seem
to
carry
with
it
some
ah
suggestions
of
a
theatrical
nature
but
as
shakespeare
says
in
a
name
perhaps
you
can
suggest
a
more
suitable
one
a
fellow
was
the
general
verdict
and
some
admirers
added
that
ideas
which
in
weaker
men
might
seem
to
lean
towards
free
thought
and
even
towards
jacobinism
became
westcote
handsomely
enough
he
knew
how
to
carry
them
off
to
wear
them
lightly
as
flourishes
and
ornaments
of
his
robust
common
sense
and
might
be
trusted
not
to
go
too
far
endymion
who
had
an
exquisite
flair
for
the
approval
of
his
own
class
soon
learned
to
take
an
honest
pride
in
his
liberalism
and
to
enjoy
its
discreet
display
entertainment
at
bayfield
was
nothing
a
private
experiment
only
the
unfamiliar
must
be
handled
gently
a
good
rule
to
try
it
on
your
own
household
before
tackling
the
world
as
a
matter
of
fact
old
narcissus
had
enjoyed
it
but
if
the
neighbouring
families
were
really
curious
and
would
promise
not
to
be
shocked
they
must
come
to
the
dogs
some
sunday
evening
no
not
next
sunday
but
in
a
week
or
two
time
when
the
prisoners
as
intelligent
fellows
would
have
grasped
his
notions
sure
enough
on
the
third
sunday
he
brought
a
round
dozen
of
guests
and
the
entrance
of
the
bayfield
party
punctually
five
minutes
late
and
their
solemn
taking
of
seats
in
the
two
front
rows
thereafter
became
a
feature
of
these
entertainments
on
the
first
occasion
the
musicians
stopped
out
of
respect
in
the
middle
of
a
motet
of
scarlatti
but
endymion
gave
orders
that
in
future
this
was
not
to
be
i
have
been
something
of
an
amateur
myself
he
explained
and
know
what
is
due
to
art
it
vexed
dorothea
to
note
that
after
the
first
two
or
three
performances
some
of
her
best
friends
among
the
prisoners
absented
themselves
general
rochambeau
for
one
indeed
the
general
had
taken
to
declining
all
invitations
and
rarely
appeared
abroad
one
march
morning
meeting
him
in
the
high
street
she
made
bold
to
tax
him
with
the
change
and
ask
his
reasons
the
hour
was
eleven
in
the
forenoon
the
busiest
of
the
day
in
twenty
minutes
the
london
coach
would
be
due
with
the
mails
and
this
always
brought
the
prisoners
out
into
the
street
the
largest
crowd
gathered
in
front
of
the
dogs
waiting
to
see
the
horses
changed
and
the
bags
unloaded
but
a
second
hung
around
the
post
office
where
the
commissary
received
and
distributed
the
prisoners
letters
while
lesser
groups
shifted
and
moved
about
at
the
tail
of
the
carts
and
others
laden
with
milk
eggs
and
fresh
vegetables
from
the
country
for
axcester
had
now
a
daily
market
and
in
the
few
minutes
before
the
mail
arrival
the
salesmen
drove
their
best
trade
general
rochambeau
tapped
his
snuffbox
meditatively
like
a
man
in
two
minds
but
he
kept
a
sidelong
eye
upon
dorothea
as
she
turned
to
acknowledge
a
bow
from
the
vicomte
de
tocqueville
the
vicomte
with
an
air
of
amused
contempt
was
choosing
a
steak
for
his
dinner
using
his
to
direct
the
butcher
how
to
cut
it
out
while
his
servant
stood
ready
with
a
plate
to
tell
you
the
truth
mademoiselle
i
find
a
hand
at
picquet
with
the
admiral
less
fatiguing
for
two
old
gentlemen
than
these
public
gaieties
in
other
words
you
are
nursing
him
they
tell
me
he
has
never
been
well
since
that
night
of
the
snowstorm
your
informants
may
now
add
that
he
is
better
these
few
spring
days
have
done
wonders
for
his
rheumatism
and
indeed
he
is
dressed
and
abroad
this
morning
which
explains
why
you
are
willing
to
stop
and
chat
with
me
instead
of
hurrying
off
to
the
post
office
to
ask
for
his
letter
that
letter
which
never
comes
so
raoul
has
been
telling
you
all
about
us
dorothea
blushed
he
happened
to
speak
of
it
at
one
of
my
working
parties
he
has
a
fine
gift
for
the
pathetic
that
young
man
oh
yes
and
a
pretty
humour
too
i
can
fancy
what
he
makes
of
us
poor
old
damon
and
pythias
while
he
holds
the
skeins
with
a
smile
for
poor
old
pythias
pigtail
and
a
tremor
of
the
voice
for
the
and
a
tear
no
doubt
for
the
letter
which
never
comes
raoul
is
great
with
an
audience
you
do
him
injustice
general
an
audience
of
old
women
general
rochambeau
had
an
answer
to
this
on
his
tongue
but
repressed
it
ah
here
comes
the
admiral
he
cried
as
the
gaunt
old
man
came
shuffling
down
the
street
towards
them
with
his
stoop
his
grained
features
drawn
awry
with
twinges
of
rheumatism
his
hands
crossed
above
his
tall
cane
all
axcester
laughed
at
his
long
blue
surtout
his
pigtail
and
little
round
hat
but
dorothea
always
found
him
formidable
and
wanted
to
run
away
admiral
i
was
just
about
to
tell
miss
westcote
that
the
time
is
come
to
congratulate
her
here
is
winter
past
except
that
of
two
years
ago
the
hardest
known
in
axcester
and
thanks
to
her
subscription
lists
and
working
parties
our
countrymen
have
never
gone
so
well
fed
and
warmly
clad
which
growled
the
admiral
does
not
explain
why
no
less
than
eight
of
them
have
broken
their
parole
an
incredible
a
shameful
number
as
time
goes
on
admiral
they
grow
less
patient
hope
deferred
the
notes
of
the
guard
horn
broke
in
upon
dorothea
excuse
groups
scattered
market
carts
were
hastily
backed
alongside
the
pavement
and
down
the
came
the
mail
at
a
gallop
with
crack
of
whip
and
rushing
chime
of
bits
and
dorothea
watched
the
crowd
closing
round
it
as
it
drew
up
by
the
dogs
and
turned
to
note
that
the
admiral
face
was
pale
and
his
eyes
sought
those
of
his
old
friend
better
leave
it
to
me
if
miss
westcote
will
excuse
me
general
rochambeau
lifted
his
hat
and
hurried
after
the
crowd
then
dorothea
understood
the
old
man
beside
her
had
lost
courage
to
pick
up
his
old
habit
at
the
last
moment
his
friend
must
go
for
the
letter
which
never
came
she
cast
about
to
say
something
her
last
words
had
been
of
hope
deferred
it
would
not
do
to
take
up
her
speech
there
the
admiral
seemed
to
meet
her
eyes
with
an
effort
he
put
out
a
hand
it
is
not
good
mademoiselle
that
a
man
should
pity
himself
beware
how
you
teach
that
beware
how
you
listen
to
him
then
he
turned
from
her
abruptly
and
tottered
away
glancing
aside
she
met
the
vicomte
de
tocqueville
tired
smile
he
was
using
his
cane
to
prod
the
butcher
and
recall
his
attention
to
the
steak
but
the
butcher
continued
to
stare
down
the
street
eh
but
dear
me
it
sounds
like
an
said
the
vicomte
negligently
at
the
same
time
stepping
to
dorothea
side
the
murmur
of
the
crowd
in
front
of
the
dogs
had
been
swelling
and
now
broke
into
sharp
angry
cries
for
a
moment
then
settled
into
a
dull
roar
and
rose
in
a
hoarse
the
mail
coach
was
evidently
not
the
centre
of
disturbance
though
dorothea
could
see
its
driver
waving
his
arm
and
gesticulating
from
the
box
the
noise
came
ahead
of
it
some
twenty
yards
lower
down
the
hill
where
the
street
had
suddenly
grown
black
with
people
pressing
and
swaying
there
seems
no
danger
here
whatever
it
is
said
the
vicomte
glancing
up
at
the
above
please
go
and
see
what
is
the
matter
i
am
safe
enough
dorothea
assured
him
the
folks
in
the
house
will
give
me
shelter
if
necessary
the
vicomte
lifted
his
hat
i
will
return
and
report
promptly
if
the
affair
be
serious
but
it
was
not
serious
the
tumult
died
down
and
dorothea
with
her
was
guarding
the
steak
from
a
predatory
dog
when
the
vicomte
and
the
butcher
returned
together
reassure
yourself
miss
westcote
said
de
tocqueville
there
has
been
no
bloodshed
though
bloodshed
was
challenged
it
appears
that
almost
as
the
coach
drew
up
there
arrived
from
the
westward
a
chaise
conveying
a
young
naval
officer
from
plymouth
with
despatches
and
i
regret
to
tell
it
a
flag
his
britannic
majesty
has
captured
another
of
our
frigates
and
the
high
spirited
young
gentleman
was
making
the
most
of
it
in
all
innocence
and
without
an
idea
that
his
triumph
could
offend
anyone
in
axcester
unfortunately
on
his
way
up
the
street
he
waved
the
captured
tricolor
under
the
nose
of
your
brother
raoul
m
raoul
dorothea
caught
her
breath
on
the
name
and
raoul
leapt
into
the
chaise
then
and
there
wrested
the
flag
from
him
the
more
easily
no
doubt
because
he
expected
nothing
so
little
and
holding
it
aloft
challenged
him
to
mortal
combat
theatrically
and
apart
from
the
taste
of
it
i
report
only
from
hearsay
the
coup
must
have
been
immensely
successful
when
i
arrived
your
brother
was
restoring
peace
the
young
briton
holding
out
his
hand
swearing
he
was
sorry
begad
but
how
the
deuce
was
he
to
have
known
and
raoul
saving
the
situation
and
still
demanding
blood
with
a
face
as
long
as
an
alexandrine
drapeau
glorieux
auquel
en
sanglotant
se
prosternent
affaises
vos
membres
veterans
sorry
damitol
shake
hands
beg
your
pardon
the
vicomte
forgot
his
languor
and
burlesqued
the
scene
with
real
talent
dorothea
however
was
not
amused
you
say
my
brother
is
at
dogs
monsieur
i
think
i
will
go
to
him
you
must
allow
me
then
to
escort
you
oh
the
street
is
quite
safe
your
countrymen
will
not
suspect
me
of
exulting
over
their
misfortunes
nevertheless
he
insisted
and
walked
beside
her
a
mixed
crowd
of
french
and
english
still
surrounded
the
chaise
to
which
a
couple
of
postboys
were
attaching
the
relay
the
french
no
longer
furious
now
that
an
apology
had
been
offered
and
the
flag
hidden
but
silent
and
sulky
yet
the
english
inclined
to
think
the
young
lieutenant
hardly
served
not
to
say
churlishly
frenchmen
might
be
but
war
was
war
and
surely
britons
had
a
right
to
raise
three
cheers
for
a
victory
besides
he
had
begged
pardon
at
once
and
offered
to
shake
hands
like
a
gentleman
that
is
as
soon
as
he
discovered
whose
feelings
were
hurt
for
naturally
the
fisticuffs
had
come
first
and
in
these
master
raoul
had
taken
as
good
as
he
brought
as
the
vicomte
cleared
a
path
for
her
to
the
porch
where
endymion
stood
shaking
hands
and
bidding
adieu
dorothea
caught
her
first
and
last
glimpse
of
this
traveller
who
without
knowing
it
without
seeing
her
face
to
remember
it
or
even
learning
her
name
was
to
deflect
the
slow
current
of
her
life
and
send
it
whirling
down
a
strange
channel
giddy
precipitous
to
an
end
unguessed
she
saw
a
lad
somewhat
flushed
and
red
in
the
face
but
of
frank
and
pleasant
features
dressed
in
a
hat
blue
coat
piped
with
white
and
white
breeches
and
waistcoat
and
broad
black
a
youngster
of
the
sort
that
loves
a
scrimmage
or
a
jest
but
is
better
in
a
scrimmage
than
in
a
jest
when
the
laugh
goes
against
him
he
was
eying
the
chaise
just
now
and
obviously
cursing
the
hour
in
which
he
had
decorated
it
with
laurel
yet
on
the
whole
in
a
trying
situation
he
bore
himself
well
ah
much
obliged
to
you
vicomte
endymion
hailed
the
pair
there
has
been
a
small
misunderstanding
my
dear
dorothea
not
the
slightest
cause
for
alarm
still
you
had
better
pass
through
to
the
and
wait
for
me
dorothea
dismissed
de
tocqueville
with
a
bow
passed
into
the
dark
passage
and
pushed
open
the
door
within
sat
a
young
man
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
face
bowed
upon
his
arms
his
fingers
convulsively
twisted
a
torn
scrap
of
bunting
his
shoulders
heaved
it
was
raoul
dorothea
paused
in
the
doorway
and
spoke
his
name
he
did
not
look
up
she
stepped
towards
him
m
raoul
a
sob
shook
him
she
laid
a
hand
gently
on
his
bowed
head
on
the
dark
wave
of
hair
above
his
strong
shapely
neck
she
was
full
of
pity
longing
to
comfort
m
raoul
he
started
gazed
up
at
her
and
seized
her
hand
his
eyes
swam
with
tears
but
behind
the
tears
blazed
a
light
which
frightened
her
yet
oh
surely
she
could
not
mistake
it
dorothea
he
held
both
her
hands
now
he
was
drawing
her
towards
him
she
could
not
speak
the
room
swam
outside
the
window
she
heard
the
noise
of
starting
hoofs
of
wheels
of
the
english
crowd
hurrahing
as
the
chaise
rolled
away
her
head
almost
touched
raoul
breast
then
she
broke
loose
as
her
brother
step
sounded
in
the
passage
chapter
vii
love
and
an
old
maid
i
pray
you
be
gentle
with
dorothea
find
if
you
can
something
admirable
in
this
plain
spinster
keeping
at
the
age
of
a
room
in
her
breast
adorned
and
ready
for
first
love
find
it
pitiful
if
you
must
that
the
blind
boy
should
mistake
his
lodging
only
do
not
laugh
or
your
laughter
may
accuse
you
in
the
sequel
she
had
a
most
simple
heart
wonder
filled
it
as
she
rode
home
to
bayfield
and
by
the
bridge
she
reined
up
mercury
as
if
to
take
her
bearings
in
an
unfamiliar
country
at
her
feet
rushed
the
axe
swollen
by
spring
freshets
a
bullfinch
wet
from
his
bath
bobbed
on
the
stone
parapet
shook
himself
and
piped
a
note
or
two
away
up
the
stream
among
the
alders
birds
were
chasing
and
courting
from
above
the
bayfield
elms
out
of
spaces
of
blue
the
larks
song
fell
like
a
din
of
innumerable
silver
hammers
either
new
sense
had
been
given
her
or
the
rains
had
washed
the
landscape
and
restored
obliterated
lines
colours
meanings
the
very
leaves
by
the
roadside
were
fragrant
as
flowers
for
the
moment
it
sufficed
to
know
that
she
was
loved
and
that
she
loved
she
was
no
fool
at
the
back
of
all
her
wonder
lay
the
certainty
that
in
the
world
eyes
such
love
as
hers
was
absurd
that
it
must
end
where
it
began
that
raoul
could
never
be
hers
nor
she
escape
from
a
captivity
as
real
as
his
but
perhaps
because
she
knew
all
this
so
certainly
she
could
put
it
aside
this
thing
had
come
to
her
this
happiness
to
which
alone
in
darkness
depressed
by
every
look
into
the
mirror
by
every
casual
proof
that
her
brothers
and
intimates
accepted
the
verdict
as
final
her
soul
had
been
loyal
a
forgotten
servant
of
a
neglectful
lord
in
the
silence
of
her
own
room
in
her
garden
in
the
quiet
stir
of
household
duties
and
again
during
the
long
evenings
while
she
sat
knitting
by
the
fire
and
her
brothers
talked
she
had
pondered
much
upon
love
and
puzzled
herself
with
many
questions
she
had
watched
girls
and
their
lovers
wives
and
their
husbands
can
love
she
had
asked
draw
near
and
pass
and
go
its
way
unrecognised
she
had
conned
the
signs
now
the
hour
had
come
and
she
had
needed
none
of
her
learning
eyes
hands
and
voice
she
had
known
the
authentic
god
and
she
knew
that
it
was
not
absurd
she
knew
herself
worthy
of
belated
condescension
not
raoul
for
the
moment
she
scarcely
thought
of
raoul
for
the
moment
raoul
image
grew
faint
and
indefinite
in
the
glory
of
being
loved
instinct
too
thrust
it
into
the
background
for
as
raoul
grew
definite
so
must
his
youth
his
circumstances
the
world
laughter
the
barriers
never
to
be
overcome
but
merely
to
be
loved
and
to
rest
in
that
knowledge
awhile
here
were
no
barriers
the
thing
had
happened
it
was
nothing
could
forbid
or
efface
it
yet
when
she
reached
home
after
forcing
the
astonished
mercury
to
canter
up
the
entire
length
of
bayfield
hill
she
must
walk
straight
to
her
room
and
study
her
face
in
the
glass
it
has
happened
to
you
to
you
why
has
it
not
transfigured
you
but
then
people
would
guess
your
teeth
stand
out
well
not
so
very
prominently
but
they
stand
out
and
that
is
why
foreigners
laugh
at
englishwomen
yes
it
has
happened
to
you
but
why
how
it
so
happened
that
she
must
meet
him
the
next
day
narcissus
had
engaged
him
to
make
drawings
of
the
bayfield
pavement
a
new
series
to
supersede
hers
in
an
enlarged
edition
of
the
treatise
every
one
of
the
was
to
be
drawn
to
scale
and
she
must
meet
him
in
the
library
with
her
brother
and
receive
instructions
for
she
had
promised
to
help
in
taking
measurements
when
the
time
came
and
she
entered
the
library
she
did
not
indeed
dare
to
lift
her
eyes
but
narcissus
already
immersed
in
calculations
scarcely
looked
up
from
his
paper
ah
there
you
are
have
you
brought
the
he
asked
and
after
a
minute
she
marvelled
at
her
own
even
when
he
left
them
to
work
out
the
measurements
together
and
it
flashed
upon
her
that
henceforth
they
would
often
be
left
together
her
immunity
being
taken
for
granted
she
kept
her
head
bowed
over
the
papers
and
managed
to
control
her
voice
to
put
one
or
two
ordinary
questions
until
the
pencil
dropped
from
her
fingers
and
she
felt
her
hand
imprisoned
dorothea
oh
please
no
she
entreated
hoarsely
m
raoul
charles
she
attempted
to
draw
her
hand
away
but
failing
lifted
her
eyes
for
mercy
they
were
sick
and
troubled
charles
he
insisted
charles
then
she
relented
and
he
kissed
her
gaily
it
was
as
if
she
drank
in
the
kiss
and
the
next
moment
recoiled
from
it
he
released
her
hand
and
waited
watching
her
she
stood
upright
by
the
table
her
shoulder
turned
to
him
her
eyes
gazing
through
the
long
window
upon
the
green
stretch
of
lawn
she
was
trembling
slightly
it
it
hurts
like
a
wound
she
murmured
and
her
hand
went
up
to
her
breast
but
you
must
listen
please
you
know
better
than
i
that
this
is
the
end
oh
yes
as
he
would
have
interrupted
it
is
beautiful
for
me
but
i
am
old
and
you
are
a
boy
and
it
is
all
quite
silly
please
listen
even
apart
from
this
it
would
be
quite
silly
and
could
end
nowhere
he
caught
at
her
hand
again
and
she
let
it
lie
in
his
nowhere
she
repeated
and
lifting
her
head
nodded
twice
her
eyes
were
brimming
but
if
you
love
me
he
began
she
waited
a
moment
but
he
did
not
finish
ah
there
it
is
you
see
you
can
not
finish
i
was
afraid
to
meet
you
but
now
i
am
glad
because
we
can
talk
about
it
once
and
for
all
charles
she
hesitated
over
the
name
dear
i
have
been
thinking
since
we
see
this
so
clearly
it
can
be
no
treachery
to
my
brothers
to
let
our
love
stand
where
it
does
at
my
age
and
dorothea
laughed
nervously
one
is
more
easily
contented
than
at
yours
i
can
not
bear
your
talking
in
this
way
oh
yes
you
can
she
assured
him
with
a
practical
little
nod
i
do
like
it
myself
but
it
has
to
be
done
now
in
the
first
place
when
we
meet
like
this
there
must
be
no
kissing
she
blushed
while
her
voice
wavered
again
over
the
word
then
as
again
his
hand
closed
upon
hers
she
laughed
well
yes
you
may
kiss
my
hand
but
i
must
not
have
it
on
my
conscience
that
i
am
hiding
from
endymion
and
narcissus
what
they
have
a
right
to
know
of
course
they
would
be
angry
if
they
knew
that
i
that
i
was
fond
of
you
at
all
but
they
would
have
no
right
for
they
could
not
have
forbidden
or
prevented
it
now
if
our
prospects
were
what
folks
would
call
happier
why
then
in
earnest
of
them
you
might
kiss
me
but
then
you
would
be
bound
to
go
to
my
brothers
and
tell
them
but
since
it
can
all
come
to
nothing
a
ghost
of
a
smile
finished
the
sentence
this
war
can
not
last
for
ever
it
seems
to
have
lasted
ever
since
i
can
remember
but
what
difference
could
its
ending
make
ah
yes
then
i
should
lose
you
she
cried
in
dismay
but
added
with
as
sudden
remorse
forgive
my
selfishness
you
are
adorable
said
he
and
they
laughed
and
picked
up
their
pencils
dorothea
casuistry
might
prove
her
ignorant
of
love
and
its
perils
as
a
child
is
of
fire
but
having
as
she
deemed
discovered
the
limits
of
her
duty
and
set
up
her
terms
with
raoul
upon
them
she
soon
developed
a
wonderful
cunning
in
the
art
of
being
loved
her
plainness
and
the
difference
in
their
ages
she
took
for
granted
and
subtly
persuaded
raoul
to
take
for
granted
she
had
no
affectations
no
by
instinct
she
avoided
setting
up
any
illusion
which
he
could
not
share
unconsciously
and
naturally
she
rested
her
strength
on
the
maternal
protective
side
of
love
raoul
came
to
her
with
his
woes
his
difficulties
his
quarrel
against
fate
and
she
talked
them
over
with
him
and
advised
him
almost
as
might
a
wise
elder
sister
she
had
read
the
and
in
spite
of
the
missing
pages
with
less
of
fascination
than
disgust
yet
had
absorbed
more
than
she
knew
in
raoul
she
recognised
certain
points
of
likeness
to
his
great
countryman
points
which
had
puzzled
her
in
the
book
now
the
book
helped
her
to
treat
them
though
she
was
unaware
of
its
help
still
less
aware
was
she
of
any
likeness
between
her
and
madame
de
warens
of
whom
again
in
spite
of
the
missing
pages
she
had
a
poor
opinion
the
business
of
the
drawings
brought
raoul
to
bayfield
almost
daily
and
as
she
had
foreseen
they
were
much
alone
after
all
since
it
could
end
in
nothing
the
situation
had
its
advantages
no
one
in
the
household
gave
it
a
thought
apparently
dorothea
was
not
altogether
sure
about
polly
once
or
twice
she
had
caught
polly
eying
her
with
an
odd
expression
once
especially
when
she
had
looked
up
as
the
girl
was
plaiting
her
hair
and
their
eyes
met
in
the
glass
and
once
again
dorothea
had
sent
her
to
the
library
with
a
note
of
instructions
left
that
morning
by
narcissus
and
following
a
few
minutes
later
had
found
her
standing
and
talking
with
raoul
in
an
attitude
which
without
being
familiar
was
not
quite
respectful
what
was
she
saying
her
mistress
asked
a
moment
or
two
later
oh
nothing
he
answered
negligently
i
suppose
that
class
of
person
can
not
be
troubled
to
show
respect
to
prisoners
that
evening
dorothea
rated
the
girl
soundly
for
her
pertness
and
i
shall
speak
to
zeally
she
threatened
if
anything
of
the
kind
happens
again
if
endymion
is
to
let
you
two
have
a
house
when
you
marry
and
take
in
the
frenchmen
as
lodgers
he
will
want
to
know
that
you
treat
them
respectfully
polly
wept
and
was
forgiven
april
may
june
went
by
and
still
dorothea
lived
in
her
dream
troubled
only
by
dread
of
the
day
which
must
bring
her
lover
task
to
an
end
and
with
it
his
almost
daily
visits
bit
by
bit
she
learned
his
story
he
told
her
of
arles
his
birthplace
with
its
roman
masonry
and
amphitheatre
of
a
turreted
terraced
chateau
and
a
family
of
aristocrats
lording
it
among
the
vineyards
conspiring
a
little
later
with
other
noble
families
entertaining
them
at
secret
meetings
of
the
where
oaths
were
taken
later
again
defending
itself
behind
barricades
of
last
of
all
marched
or
carried
in
batches
to
the
guillotine
or
the
fusillade
he
told
of
avignon
and
its
papal
castle
overhanging
the
rhone
the
city
where
he
had
spent
his
school
days
and
at
the
age
of
nine
had
seen
patriot
stabbed
to
death
in
the
cordeliers
church
with
women
scissors
had
seen
jourdan
the
avenger
otherwise
march
flaming
by
at
the
head
of
his
brave
he
told
of
the
sequel
the
hundred
and
thirty
men
women
and
babes
slaughtered
in
the
dungeon
of
the
of
choisi
dragoons
and
grenadiers
at
the
gates
and
how
with
roses
scattered
before
them
they
marched
through
the
streets
to
the
castle
entered
the
gateway
and
paused
brought
to
a
stand
by
the
stench
of
putrefying
flesh
he
and
his
school
mates
had
taken
a
holiday
their
master
being
in
hiding
to
see
the
bodies
lifted
out
also
he
had
seen
the
search
party
ride
out
through
the
gates
and
return
again
bringing
jourdan
with
feet
strapped
beneath
his
horse
belly
he
told
of
his
journey
to
paris
his
purpose
to
learn
to
paint
at
such
a
time
of
the
great
david
fat
and
wheezy
back
at
his
easel
panting
from
civil
of
the
call
to
arms
his
enlistment
his
first
campaign
of
of
the
foggy
morning
of
austerlitz
his
wound
and
he
long
hours
he
lay
in
the
rear
of
a
battery
on
the
height
of
pratzen
writhing
watching
the
artillerymen
at
work
and
so
on
with
stories
of
marching
and
fighting
nights
slept
out
by
him
at
full
length
on
the
sodden
turf
beside
his
arms
she
had
no
history
to
tell
him
in
exchange
she
asked
only
to
listen
and
to
comfort
yet
so
cleverly
he
addressed
his
story
that
the
longest
monologue
became
by
aid
of
a
look
or
pressure
of
the
hand
a
conversation
in
which
she
his
guardian
angel
bore
her
part
did
he
talk
of
avignon
for
instance
it
was
the
land
of
laura
and
petrarch
and
she
seated
with
eyes
beneath
the
bayfield
elms
saw
the
pair
beside
the
waters
of
vaucluse
saw
the
roses
and
and
arid
plains
of
provence
and
wondered
at
the
trouble
in
their
spiritual
love
she
was
not
troubled
love
as
a
dureless
content
and
a
trustless
joy
lay
outside
of
her
knowledge
and
she
had
no
desire
to
prove
it
in
this
only
she
forgot
the
difference
between
age
and
hers
the
day
came
when
his
work
was
ended
they
spent
a
great
part
of
that
afternoon
in
the
garden
now
in
the
height
of
its
midsummer
glory
raoul
was
very
silent
but
this
must
not
end
it
can
not
end
so
he
groaned
once
or
twice
he
never
forgot
for
long
his
old
spite
against
time
it
will
never
end
for
me
she
murmured
of
what
are
you
made
then
that
you
look
forward
to
living
on
shadows
one
would
say
almost
cheerfully
i
believe
you
could
be
happy
if
you
never
saw
me
again
even
if
that
had
to
be
she
answered
gravely
while
i
knew
you
loved
me
i
should
never
be
quite
unhappy
but
you
must
find
a
way
while
you
can
to
come
sometimes
yes
you
must
come

dorothea
sat
in
the
great
hall
of
bayfield
between
the
lamplight
and
the
moonlight
listening
to
the
drip
of
the
fountain
beneath
its
tiny
cupola
a
midsummer
fell
through
the
uncurtained
lantern
beneath
the
dome
and
spread
in
a
small
pool
of
silver
at
her
feet
beneath
one
of
the
two
shaded
lamps
endymion
lounged
in
his
armchair
and
read
the
sherborne
mercury
narcissus
had
carried
off
the
other
to
a
table
across
the
hall
by
the
long
bookcase
and
above
the
banked
about
the
fountain
she
saw
it
shining
on
his
shapely
grey
head
as
he
bent
over
a
copy
of
the
antonine
itinerary
and
patiently
worked
out
a
new
theory
of
its
distances
her
own
face
rested
in
deep
shadow
and
she
felt
grateful
for
it
as
she
leaned
back
thinking
her
own
thoughts
it
was
a
whole
week
now
since
charles
had
visited
bayfield
but
she
had
encountered
him
that
morning
in
axcester
high
street
as
she
passed
up
it
on
horseback
with
her
brothers
narcissus
had
reined
up
to
put
some
question
or
other
about
the
drawings
but
endymion
who
did
not
share
his
brother
liking
for
raoul
had
ridden
on
and
she
had
ridden
on
too
though
reluctantly
she
recalled
his
salute
his
glance
at
her
and
eyes
she
wondered
what
point
narcissus
and
he
had
discussed
and
blamed
herself
for
not
having
found
courage
to
the
stable
clock
struck
ten
she
arose
and
kissed
her
brothers
night
by
narcissus
she
paused
be
careful
of
your
eyes
dear
and
if
you
are
going
to
be
busy
with
that
great
book
these
next
few
evenings
i
will
have
the
table
brought
across
to
the
other
side
where
you
will
be
cosier
narcissus
came
out
of
his
calculations
and
looked
up
at
her
gently
please
do
not
disarrange
the
furniture
for
me
a
change
always
fidgets
me
even
before
i
take
in
precisely
what
has
happened
he
smiled
in
that
i
resemble
my
old
friend
vespasian
who
would
have
no
alterations
made
when
he
visited
his
home
villa
qualis
fuerat
olim
ne
quid
scilicet
oculorum
consuetudini
a
pleasant
trait
i
have
always
thought
he
lit
her
candle
and
kissed
her
and
dorothea
went
up
the
broad
staircase
to
her
own
room
along
the
corridor
she
stayed
a
moment
to
look
down
upon
the
hall
endymion
had
dropped
his
newspaper
and
was
yawning
a
sure
sign
that
narcissus
already
reabsorbed
in
the
itinerary
would
in
a
few
moments
be
hurried
from
it
to
bed
she
reached
the
door
of
her
room
and
opened
it
then
checked
an
exclamation
of
annoyance
for
some
mysterious
reason
polly
had
forgotten
to
light
her
candle
this
was
her
rule
never
broken
before
she
stepped
to
the
bellpull
her
hand
was
on
it
when
she
heard
the
girl
voice
muttering
in
the
next
room
the
boudoir
at
least
it
sounded
like
polly
voice
though
its
tone
was
strangely
subdued
and
level
talking
to
herself
dorothea
decided
and
smiled
in
spite
of
her
annoyance
as
everyone
smiles
who
catches
another
in
this
trick
she
dropped
the
bellpull
and
opened
the
boudoir
door
polly
was
not
talking
to
herself
she
was
leaning
far
out
of
the
open
window
and
at
the
sound
of
the
door
started
back
into
the
room
with
a
gasp
and
a
short
cry
to
whom
were
you
talking
dorothea
had
set
the
candle
down
in
the
bedroom
outside
the
window
the
park
lay
spread
to
the
soft
moonshine
but
the
moon
did
not
look
directly
into
the
boudoir
in
the
mistress
and
maid
sought
each
other
eyes
to
whom
were
you
talking
dorothea
demanded
sternly
polly
was
silent
for
a
second
or
two
then
her
chin
went
up
defiantly
to
raoul
she
muttered
to
m
raoul
to
raoul
i
do
understand
is
raoul
oh
for
goodness
sake
speak
girl
what
is
that
i
see
a
piece
of
paper
in
your
hand
polly
twisted
it
in
her
fingers
and
made
a
movement
to
hide
it
in
her
pocket
but
with
the
movement
she
seemed
to
reflect
he
gave
it
to
me
i
do
understand
anything
about
it
i
was
shutting
the
window
when
he
whistled
to
me
he
gave
me
this
i
i
think
he
meant
it
for
you
polly
tone
suddenly
became
saucy
but
her
voice
shook
dorothea
was
shaking
too
as
her
fingers
closed
on
the
note
she
vainly
sought
to
read
the
girl
eyes
her
own
cheeks
were
burning
she
felt
the
blood
rushing
into
them
and
singing
in
her
ears
yet
in
her
abasement
she
kept
her
dignity
and
motioning
polly
to
follow
stepped
into
the
bedroom
unfolded
the
letter
slowly
and
read
it
by
the
candle
there
my
angel
i
have
hungered
now
for
a
week
be
at
your
window
this
evening
and
let
me
at
least
be
fed
with
a
word
see
what
i
risk
for
you
yours
devotedly
and
for
ever
there
was
no
signature
but
well
enough
dorothea
knew
the
handwriting
a
wave
of
anger
swelled
in
her
heart
the
first
she
had
ever
felt
towards
him
he
had
behaved
selfishly
see
what
i
risk
for
you
but
to
what
risk
was
he
exposing
her
he
was
breaking
their
covenant
too
demanding
that
which
he
must
know
her
conscience
abhorred
she
had
not
believed
he
could
understand
her
so
poorly
held
her
so
cheap
cheap
indeed
since
he
had
risked
her
secret
in
polly
hand
she
turned
the
paper
over
noting
its
creases
suddenly
you
have
opened
and
read
this
she
said
polly
admitted
it
with
downcast
eyes
the
girl
after
the
first
surprise
had
demeaned
herself
admirably
and
now
stood
in
the
attitude
proper
to
a
confidential
servant
solicitous
respectful
prepared
to
blink
the
peccadillo
even
to
sympathise
discreetly
at
a
hint
given
i
sorry
miss
that
i
opened
it
i
ought
to
have
told
you
but
you
took
me
by
surprise
you
know
miss
that
you
gave
me
leave
to
run
down
to
my
aunt
this
evening
and
on
my
way
back
just
as
i
was
letting
myself
in
by
the
nursery
gate
raoul
comes
tearing
up
the
hill
after
me
and
slips
this
into
my
hand
to
tell
you
the
truth
it
rather
frightened
me
being
run
after
like
that
and
he
said
something
and
ran
back
for
nine
was
just
striking
and
in
a
moment
the
would
be
ringing
and
he
must
be
back
to
answer
his
name
so
in
my
fluster
i
did
catch
what
he
meant
when
i
got
home
and
opened
it
i
saw
my
mistake
but
you
were
downstairs
at
dinner
i
could
get
to
speak
with
you
alone
i
waited
to
tell
you
and
just
now
when
i
was
drawing
the
blinds
i
heard
a
whistle
raoul
had
no
right
to
send
me
such
a
message
polly
i
can
not
think
what
he
means
by
it
nothing
that
i
have
ever
said
to
him
no
miss
polly
assented
readily
after
a
pause
she
added
i
suppose
you
like
me
to
go
now
you
wo
be
wanting
your
hair
done
certainly
i
wish
you
to
stay
is
he
is
raoul
outside
i
think
so
miss
oh
yes
for
certain
he
is
then
i
must
insist
on
your
staying
with
me
while
i
dismiss
him
very
good
miss
would
you
wish
me
to
stay
here
or
to
come
with
you
dorothea
felt
herself
blushing
and
her
temper
rose
again
for
the
moment
stay
here
i
will
leave
the
door
open
and
call
you
when
you
are
wanted
she
passed
into
the
boudoir
and
bent
to
the
open
window
at
this
corner
the
foundations
of
the
house
stood
some
feet
lower
than
the
slope
out
of
which
they
had
been
levelled
and
she
looked
down
upon
a
glacis
of
smooth
turf
capped
by
a
glimmering
parapet
of
bath
stone
beyond
stretched
the
moonlit
park
m
raoul
she
called
but
scarcely
above
a
whisper
a
figure
crept
out
from
the
dark
angle
below
and
climbed
to
the
parapet
dorothea
forgive
me
another
night
and
no
word
with
you
i
could
not
bear
it
you
are
mad
you
are
breaking
your
parole
and
risking
shame
for
me
nay
you
have
shamed
me
already
polly
is
here
polly
is
a
good
girl
she
understands
a
word
then
if
you
must
drive
me
away
your
i
can
pass
the
sentries
no
fear
of
the
patrol
hereabouts
your
hand
let
down
your
hand
to
me
i
can
reach
it
from
the
parapet
here
with
my
fingers
only
not
with
my
lips
though
even
that
you
never
forbade
weakly
she
lowered
her
arm
over
the
sill
he
reached
to
touch
it
and
she
leaned
her
face
towards
his
hers
in
shadow
his
pale
in
the
moonlight
before
their
fingers
met
a
yellow
flame
leapt
from
the
angle
to
the
left
a
loud
report
banged
in
her
ears
and
echoed
across
the
park
and
raoul
after
swaying
a
second
pitched
forward
with
a
sharp
cry
and
rolled
to
the
foot
of
the
glacis
dorothea
forced
herself
back
in
the
room
and
stood
there
upright
and
shook
with
polly
beside
her
holding
her
two
hands
they
have
shot
him
the
two
women
listened
for
a
moment
all
was
still
now
polly
stepped
to
the
window
and
closed
it
softly
but
why
what
are
you
doing
dorothea
asked
in
a
hoarse
whisper
they
will
find
quite
enough
without
that
said
the
practical
girl
but
her
voice
quavered
yet
if
they
had
seen
ah
how
selfish
to
think
of
that
now
hush
that
was
a
groan
he
is
alive
still
she
moved
towards
the
window
but
polly
dragged
her
back
by
main
force
listen
miss
below
they
heard
the
sudden
unbarring
of
doors
and
endymion
voice
calling
for
mudge
the
butler
a
bell
pealed
in
the
servants
hall
stopped
and
began
ringing
again
in
short
and
violent
jerks
let
me
go
commanded
dorothea
they
will
never
find
him
under
the
slope
there
he
may
be
bleeding
to
death
i
must
tell
but
polly
clung
to
her
they
find
him
safe
enough
miss
dorothea
there
sam
now
hark
at
the
backdoor
bell
he
tell
them
sam
sam
zeally
miss
but
i
do
understand
dorothea
stammered
with
a
sharp
suspicion
of
treachery
she
pushed
the
girl
from
her
was
zeally
mounting
guard
tonight
if
i
thought
do
tell
me
it
was
a
trap
oh
you
wicked
girl
no
it
was
answered
polly
sulkily
i
do
know
nothing
of
sam
movements
but
he
might
be
hanging
about
the
house
and
if
he
saw
a
man
talking
to
me
he
just
as
jealous
as
fire
she
broke
off
at
the
sound
of
voices
below
the
window
the
ray
of
a
lantern
as
the
jolted
it
flashed
and
danced
on
wall
and
ceiling
of
the
dim
boudoir
a
sharp
exclamation
announced
that
raoul
was
discovered
a
confused
muttering
followed
and
then
dorothea
heard
endymion
voice
calling
up
to
mudge
from
the
bottom
of
the
trench
run
to
miss
westcote
room
and
tell
her
we
shall
require
lint
and
bandages
there
is
no
cause
for
alarm
assure
her
say
there
has
been
an
accident
a
frenchman
overtaken
out
of
bounds
and
wounded
i
think
not
seriously
if
she
be
gone
to
bed
get
the
medicine
chest
and
the
key
and
bring
them
into
the
kitchen
dorothea
had
charge
of
the
bayfield
medicine
chest
and
kept
it
in
a
cupboard
of
the
boudoir
she
groped
for
it
pulled
open
drawer
after
drawer
rifled
them
for
lint
and
linen
and
by
the
time
mudge
tapped
on
the
door
stood
ready
with
the
chest
under
one
arm
and
a
heap
of
bandages
in
the
other
in
the
kitchen
endymion
said
i
am
coming
at
once
take
the
chest
run
and
have
as
many
candles
lit
as
possible
mudge
ran
dorothea
followed
with
polly
behind
her
trembling
like
a
leaf
the
two
women
reached
the
kitchen
as
the
party
entered
with
raoul
and
supported
him
to
a
chair
beside
the
dying
fire
his
face
was
colourless
and
he
lay
back
and
closed
his
eyes
weakly
as
endymion
stooped
to
examine
the
wounded
leg
with
narcissus
in
close
attendance
and
the
others
standing
respectfully
apart
mudge

in
their

the
door
in

with
his
japanned
shako
askew
and
his
brown
bess
still
in
his
hand
behind
his
shoulder
three
or
four
of
the
women
servants
hung
about
the
doorway
and
peered
in
between
curiosity
and
terror
it
was
a
part
of
endymion
fastidiousness
that
the
sight
of
blood
that
is
of
human
blood
turned
his
stomach
in
her
distress
dorothea
could
not
help
admiring
how
he
conquered
this
aversion
how
he
knelt
in
his
evening
dress
and
after
turning
back
his
ruffles
unlaced
the
prisoner
soaked
shoe
and
rolled
down
the
stocking
he
looked
up
gratefully
as
she
entered
in
such
emergencies
narcissus
was
worse
than
useless
but
dorothea
had
the
nursing
instinct
and
her
brothers
recognised
it
the
sight
of
a
wound
or
a
hurt
steadied
her
wits
and
she
became
practical
and
helpful
at
once
a
flesh
wound
only
i
think
just
above
the
ankle
the
tendon
cut
but
the
bone
apparently
not
broken
it
may
be
splintered
though
said
dorothea
has
anyone
thought
of
sending
for
doctor
ibbetson
he
must
be
fetched
at
once
a
towel
please
three
or
four
from
the
dresser
there
a
footman
brought
the
towels
she
knelt
folded
two
on
her
lap
and
resting
raoul
foot
there
drew
the
stocking
gently
from
the
wound
a
basin
and
warm
water
not
too
hot
polly
you
will
find
a
small
sponge
in
the
second
drawer
she
nodded
towards
the
medicine
chest
one
of
you
make
up
a
better
fire
and
set
on
a
fresh
kettle
she
gave
her
orders
in
a
low
firm
voice
and
continued
to
direct
everyone
thus
while
she
sponged
the
wound
and
drew
off
the
stocking
neither
towards
them
nor
towards
raoul
did
she
lift
her
eyes
the
bare
foot
of
her
beloved
rested
in
her
lap
she
heard
him
groan
twice
but
with
no
pain
inflicted
by
her
fingers
if
their
slightest
pressure
had
hurt
him
she
would
have
known
she
went
on
bathing
the
wound
she
who
could
have
bathed
it
with
her
tears
as
time
passed
and
still
the
doctor
did
not
come
she
began
to
bandage
it
she
called
on
polly
for
the
bandages
then
still
without
looking
up
she
divined
that
polly
was
useless
was
engaged
in
trying
to
catch
zeally
eye
and
warn
him
or
get
a
word
with
him
he
pale
as
a
ghost
yet
said
endymion
another
dose
of
brandy
might
set
him
up
i
gave
him
some
from
my
flask
before
bringing
him
in
he
is
not
going
to
faint
she
answered
well
i
wo
bother
him
with
questions
until
he
comes
round
a
bit
you
zeally
had
better
step
into
my
room
though
and
give
me
your
version
of
the
affair
but
as
the
corporal
saluted
and
took
a
step
forward
the
prisoner
opened
his
eyes
before
you
examine
zeally
sir
let
me
save
you
what
trouble
i
can
he
spoke
faintly
but
with
deliberation
i
wish
to
deny
nothing
i
was
escaping
and
he
tracked
me
he
came
on
me
as
i
cut
across
the
park
and
challenged
i
did
not
answer
but
ran
around
a
corner
of
the
house
and
jumped
the
parapet
thinking
to
double
along
the
trench
there
and
put
him
off
the
scent
at
least
to
dodge
the
bullet
if
he
fired
but
as
i
jumped
for
it
he
winged
me
a
very
pretty
shot
too
with
your
leave
sir
i
like
to
shake
hands
with
him
on
it
shake
hands
corporal
raoul
stretched
out
a
hand
sideways
you
a
smart
fellow
and
no
malice
between
soldiers
dorothea
heard
polly
gasp
it
seemed
to
her
that
all
the
room
must
hear
it
her
own
hand
trembled
on
the
bandage
she
had
forgotten
her
danger
the
all
but
inevitable
scandal
until
raoul
brought
it
back
to
her
and
in
the
same
breath
saved
her
by
his
heroic
lie
she
could
not
profit
by
it
though
her
lips
parted
to
refute
it
and
for
the
first
time
she
gazed
up
at
him
her
eyes
brimming
with
sudden
love
gratitude
pride
even
while
they
entreated
against
the
sacrifice
he
was
smiling
down
with
an
air
of
faint
amusement
yet
beneath
the
lashes
she
read
a
command
which
mastered
her
will
imposed
silence
he
had
taken
on
a
new
manliness
and
for
the
first
time
in
the
story
of
their
loves
she
felt
herself
dominated
by
something
stronger
than
passion
he
had
swept
her
off
her
feet
before
now
by
boyish
ardour
her
humility
the
marvel
of
being
loved
had
aided
him
but
hitherto
in
her
heart
she
had
always
felt
her
own
character
to
be
the
stronger
now
he
challenged
her
on
woman
own
ground
that
of
he
commanded
her
to
his
own
hurt
he
towered
above
her
she
had
never
dreamed
of
a
love
like
this
beaten
despairing
for
him
yet
proud
as
she
had
never
been
in
her
life
she
held
her
breath
corporal
zeally
was
merely
bewildered
his
was
a
deliberate
mind
and
had
hatched
out
the
night
catastrophe
after
incubating
it
for
weeks
unconvinced
by
polly
explanation
of
her
meeting
with
raoul
at
the
nursery
gate
he
had
nursed
a
dull
jealousy
and
set
himself
to
watch
and
had
dogged
his
man
down
at
length
with
the
slow
cunning
of
a
yokel
bred
of
a
line
of
poachers
raoul
tribute
to
his
smartness
perplexed
him
and
almost
he
scented
a
trap
beg
your
pardon
squire
he
began
heavily
forgetting
military
forms
of
address
but
the
gentleman
do
put
it
right
oh
hang
your
british
modesty
put
in
raoul
with
a
wry
laugh
if
it
pleases
you
to
represent
that
the
whole
thing
was
accidental
and
you
do
deserve
to
be
promoted
sergeant
for
tonight
work
at
least
you
might
respect
my
vanity
polly
saw
her
opportunity
she
crossed
boldly
and
made
as
if
to
lay
over
the
corporal
mouth
the
hand
that
would
fain
have
boxed
his
ears
reckon
this
is
my
affair
she
announced
with
an
effrontery
at
which
one
of
the
footmen
guffawed
openly
be
modest
as
you
please
my
lad
when
i
married
but
i
wo
put
up
with
modesty
from
anyone
under
a
sergeant
and
that
i
warn
the
corporal
eyed
his
sweetheart
without
forgiveness
his
mouth
was
open
but
upon
the
word
sergeant
he
shut
it
again
and
began
to
digest
the
idea
you
know
of
course
sir
endymion
westcote
addressed
the
prisoner
coldly
to
what
such
a
confession
commits
you
i
do
not
see
what
other
construction
the
facts
admit
but
it
is
so
serious
in
itself
and
in
its
consequences
that
i
warn
you
i
have
broken
my
sir
said
raoul
simply
of
the
temptations
you
can
not
judge
of
the
shame
i
am
as
profoundly
sensible
as
you
can
be
the
consequences
i
am
ready
to
suffer
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
as
ibbetson
entered
an
hour
later
dorothea
said
goodnight
to
her
brother
in
the
great
hall
he
had
lit
his
candle
and
was
mixing
himself
a
glass
of
brandy
and
water
the
sight
of
blood
he
excused
himself
i
am
sorry
for
the
fellow
though
i
never
liked
him
i
suppose
now
there
was
nothing
between
him
and
that
girl
polly
for
a
moment
from
zeally
manner
he
gulped
down
the
drink
his
confession
was
honest
enough
anyhow
poor
fool
he
safe
in
hospital
for
a
week
and
his
friends
if
he
has
any
and
they
know
what
it
means
will
pray
for
that
week
to
be
prolonged
what
does
it
mean
dorothea
managed
to
ask
it
means
dartmoor
dorothea
candlestick
shook
in
her
hand
and
the
extinguisher
fell
on
the
floor
her
brother
picked
it
up
and
restored
it
naturally
he
murmured
with
brotherly
concern
your
nerves
it
has
been
a
trying
night
but
you
comported
yourself
admirably
dorothea
ibbetson
assures
me
he
could
not
have
tied
the
bandage
better
himself
i
felt
proud
of
my
sister
he
kissed
her
gallantly
and
pulled
out
his
watch
past
twelve
time
they
were
round
with
the
barouche
the
sooner
we
get
master
raoul
down
to
the
infirmary
and
pack
him
in
bed
the
better
as
dorothea
went
up
the
stairs
she
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
on
the
gravel
she
could
not
accept
his
sacrifice
no
a
way
must
be
found
to
save
him
and
in
her
prayers
that
night
she
began
to
seek
it
but
while
she
prayed
her
heart
was
bowed
over
a
great
joy
she
had
a
hero
for
a
lover
chapter
ix
dorothea
confesses
she
saw
no
more
of
him
and
heard
very
little
before
the
court
martial
met
no
one
acquainted
with
the
code
of
that
age
so
in
its
proprieties
so
in
its
vices
will
need
to
be
told
that
she
never
dreamed
of
asking
her
brother
permission
to
visit
the
prisoners
infirmary
he
reported
once
a
day
perhaps
and
casually
that
the
patient
was
doing
well
dorothea
ventured
once
to
sound
general
rochambeau
but
the
old
aristocrat
answered
stiffly
that
he
took
no
interest
in
and
plainly
hinted
that
in
his
judgment
raoul
had
sinned
past
pardon
which
but
added
to
her
remorse
from
time
to
time
she
obtained
some
hearsay
news
through
polly
but
polly
chief
interest
now
lay
in
her
approaching
marriage
for
the
commissary
while
accepting
raoul
version
of
his
capture
had
an
intuitive
gift
which
saved
him
from
wholly
believing
in
it
indeed
his
conduct
of
the
affair
if
we
consider
the
extent
of
his
knowledge
was
nothing
less
than
masterly
corporal
zeally
found
himself
a
sergeant
within
hours
and
within
an
hour
of
the
announcement
he
and
polly
were
given
an
audience
in
the
bayfield
library
with
the
result
that
parson
milliton
cried
their
banns
in
axcester
church
on
the
following
sunday
and
the
received
a
month
wages
and
three
weeks
notice
of
dismissal
with
a
hint
that
the
reason
for
her
short
retention
to
instruct
her
successor
in
miss
dorothea
ways
was
ostensible
rather
than
real
with
raoul
fate
he
declined
to
meddle
here
he
said
in
effect
is
my
report
including
the
prisoner
confession
i
do
my
simple
duty
in
presenting
it
but
the
young
man
was
captured
in
my
grounds
he
was
known
to
be
a
of
my
brother
finding
him
wounded
and
faint
with
loss
of
blood
we
naturally
did
our
best
for
him
and
this
again
renders
me
perhaps
too
sympathetic
the
law
is
the
law
however
and
must
take
its
course
no
attitude
could
have
been
more
proper
or
have
shown
better
feeling
so
raoul
who
made
a
rapid
recovery
barring
the
limp
which
he
carried
to
the
end
of
his
days
was
tried
condemned
and
sentenced
in
the
space
of
two
hours
he
stuck
to
his
story
and
the
court
had
no
alternative
dartmoor
or
stapleton
inevitably
awaited
the
prisoner
who
broke
parole
and
was
retaken
the
night
after
his
sentence
raoul
was
marched
past
the
bayfield
gates
under
escort
for
dartmoor
and
dorothea
had
not
intervened
this
of
course
proves
that
she
was
of
no
heroical
fibre
she
knew
it
night
after
night
she
had
lain
awake
vainly
contriving
plans
for
his
deliverance
and
either
she
lacked
inventiveness
or
was
too
honest
for
no
method
could
she
discover
which
avoided
confession
of
the
simple
truth
as
the
days
passed
without
catastrophe
and
without
news
save
that
her
lover
was
bettering
in
hospital
she
staved
off
the
truth
trusting
that
the
next
night
would
bring
inspiration
almost
she
hoped
being
quite
unwise
in
such
matters
that
his
sufferings
would
be
accepted
as
cancelling
his
offence
so
she
played
the
coward
the
blow
fell
on
the
evening
when
endymion
announced
in
casual
tones
that
the
court
martial
was
fixed
for
the
day
after
next
that
night
indeed
brought
something
like
an
inspiration
and
on
the
morrow
she
rode
into
axcester
and
called
upon
polly
now
a
bride
of
six
days
standing
and
domiciled
in
one
of
the
westcote
cottages
in
church
street
a
little
beyond
the
bridge
for
a
call
of
state
this
was
somewhat
premature
but
it
might
pass
polly
appeared
to
think
it
premature
her
furniture
was
and
her
hair
in
she
obviously
did
not
expect
visitors
and
resented
this
curtailment
of
the
honeymoon
she
showed
it
even
when
dorothea
after
apologies
came
straight
to
the
point
polly
i
am
very
unhappy
indeed
miss
you
know
that
i
must
be
since
raoul
is
going
to
that
horrible
rather
than
let
the
truth
be
known
but
since
you
did
encourage
him
miss
of
course
i
did
encourage
him
to
come
said
dorothea
quickly
why
then
it
was
his
own
fault
and
he
broke
his
word
by
breaking
bounds
yes
strictly
his
parole
was
broken
but
the
meaning
of
parole
is
that
a
prisoner
promises
to
make
no
attempt
to
escape
raoul
never
dreamed
of
escaping
yet
that
is
the
ground
of
his
punishment
well
said
polly
if
he
chooses
to
say
he
was
escaping
i
do
see
how
we
i
mean
how
you
can
help
why
by
telling
the
truth
and
that
what
we
ought
to
do
though
it
was
wrong
of
him
to
expose
us
to
it
to
be
sure
it
was
polly
assented
but
urged
dorothea
could
we
tell
the
truth
of
what
happened
without
anyone
wanting
to
know
more
he
gave
you
a
note
which
you
took
without
guessing
what
it
contained
he
wished
to
have
speech
with
me
before
you
could
give
me
the
note
and
i
could
refuse
to
see
him
as
i
should
certainly
have
done
he
had
arrived
his
folly
deserves
punishment
but
no
such
punishment
as
being
sent
to
dartmoor
polly
eyed
her
shrewdly
have
you
burnt
the
note
she
asked
dorothea
blushing
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
stammered
no
i
kept
it
it
was
evidence
for
him
you
see
i
wish
now
she
broke
off
as
polly
nodded
her
head
i
guessed
you
have
kept
it
and
now
you
never
make
up
your
mind
to
burn
it
you
too
honest
but
surely
the
note
itself
would
not
be
called
for
i
do
know
folks
ask
curious
questions
in
courts
of
law
always
heard
beggin
your
pardon
miss
but
your
face
tells
too
many
tales
and
anyone
but
a
fool
would
ask
for
that
note
before
he
been
dealing
with
you
three
minutes
if
he
did
he
ask
you
what
was
in
it
and
then
you
be
forced
to
tell
lies
which
you
could
to
save
your
soul
dorothea
knew
this
to
be
true
she
reflected
a
moment
i
should
decline
to
show
it
or
to
answer
zeally
thought
it
about
time
to
assert
herself
very
good
miss
and
now
how
about
me
they
ask
me
questions
too
and
i
have
you
consider
miss
dorothea
that
though
not
shaken
down
to
it
yet
not
as
you
might
say
in
a
state
to
expect
callers
or
make
them
properly
welcome
i
a
respectable
married
woman
i
do
mind
confessing
to
you
zeally
is
a
comfortable
man
he
pleased
enough
to
be
sergeant
though
he
do
quite
know
how
it
came
about
and
he
that
sullen
with
brooding
over
it
that
for
sixpence
he
give
me
the
strap
to
ease
his
feelings
i
ai
complaining
endymion
chose
to
take
me
on
the
hop
and
hurry
up
the
banns
and
i
going
to
accommodate
myself
to
the
man
he
of
a
fool
and
you
need
fear
but
i
manage
him
but
i
ai
for
taking
no
risks
and
that
i
tell
you
fair
dorothea
was
stunned
you
do
mean
to
say
that
zeally
suspects
you
why
of
course
he
does
said
polly
prudence
urged
her
to
repeat
that
zeally
was
of
a
fool
but
being
nettled
she
spoke
the
words
uppermost
who
think
he
suspect
dorothea
however
was
too
desperately
dejected
to
feel
the
prick
of
this
shaft
you
will
not
help
me
then
was
all
her
reply
to
it
why
no
miss
if
you
put
it
in
that
way
a
married
woman
got
to
think
of
her
reputation
first
of
all
polly
attitude
might
be
selfish
unfeeling
but
the
fundamental
incapacity
for
gratitude
in
girls
of
polly
class
will
probably
surprise
and
pain
their
mistresses
until
the
end
of
the
world
after
all
polly
was
right
an
attempt
to
clear
raoul
by
telling
the
superficial
truth
must
involve
terrible
risks
and
might
at
any
turn
enforce
a
choice
between
full
confession
and
falsehood
dorothea
could
not
bring
herself
to
lie
even
heroically
and
there
would
be
no
heroism
in
lying
to
save
herself
on
the
other
hand
the
thought
of
a
forced
confession
it
might
he
before
a
tribunal
was
too
hideous
no
the
suggestion
had
been
a
mad
one
and
polly
had
rightly
thrown
cold
water
on
it
also
it
had
demanded
too
much
of
polly
who
could
not
be
expected
to
jeopardise
her
matrimonial
prospects
to
right
a
wrong
for
which
she
was
not
in
truth
responsible
dorothea
loved
a
hero
but
knew
she
was
no
heroine
she
called
herself
a
pitiful
coward
unjustly
because
nurtured
as
she
had
been
on
the
proprieties
surrounded
all
her
days
by
men
and
women
of
a
class
most
sensitive
to
public
opinion
who
feared
the
breath
of
scandal
worse
than
a
plague
confession
for
her
must
mean
a
shame
unspeakable
what
admit
that
she
dorothea
westcote
had
loved
a
french
prisoner
almost
young
enough
to
be
her
son
that
she
had
given
him
audience
at
night
that
he
had
been
shot
and
captured
beneath
her
window
unjustly
too
she
accused
herself
because
it
is
the
decision
not
the
terror
felt
in
deciding
which
distinguishes
the
brave
from
the
cowardly
if
you
doubt
the
event
with
dorothea
the
fault
must
be
mine
she
was
timid
but
she
came
of
a
race
which
will
endure
anything
rather
than
the
conscious
anguish
of
doing
wrong
nor
had
her
conscience
needed
them
did
it
lack
reminders
narcissus
had
been
persuaded
to
send
the
drawings
to
london
to
be
treated
by
lithography
a
process
of
which
he
knew
nothing
but
to
which
raoul
during
his
studies
in
paris
had
given
much
attention
and
apparently
not
without
making
some
discoveries
unimportant
perhaps
and
such
as
might
easily
reward
an
experimenter
in
an
art
not
well
past
its
infancy
at
any
rate
he
had
drawn
up
elaborate
instructions
for
the
london
firm
of
printers
and
when
the
proofs
arrived
with
about
a
third
of
these
instructions
neglected
and
another
third
misunderstood
narcissus
was
at
his
wits
end
aghast
at
the
poorness
of
the
impressions
yet
not
knowing
in
the
least
how
to
correct
them
he
gave
dorothea
no
peace
with
them
evening
after
evening
she
was
invited
to
pore
upon
the
drawings
over
which
she
and
her
lover
had
bent
together
to
criticise
here
and
offer
a
suggestion
there
while
every
line
revived
a
memory
inflicted
a
pang
what
suggestion
could
she
find
save
the
one
which
must
not
be
spoken
to
send
fetch
the
artist
back
from
dartmoor
and
remedy
all
this
with
so
much
beside
but
urged
narcissus
you
and
he
spent
hours
together
i
quite
understood
that
he
had
explained
the
process
to
you
and
on
the
strength
of
this
i
gave
it
too
little
attention
of
course
if
one
could
have
foreseen
he
broke
off
and
added
with
some
testiness
i
give
fifty
pounds
to
have
the
fellow
back
if
only
for
ten
minutes
talk
but
why
could
we
dorothea
asked
suddenly
breathlessly
they
were
alone
by
the
table
under
the
bookcase
on
the
far
side
of
the
hall
before
the
fire
endymion
dozed
after
a
long
day
with
the
partridges
narcissus
words
awoke
a
wild
hope
but
why
could
we
she
repeated
her
voice
scarcely
louder
than
a
whisper
well
that
an
idea
he
chuckled
confound
the
fellow
he
imposed
on
all
of
us
if
we
had
only
guessed
what
he
intended
we
might
have
signed
a
petition
telling
him
how
necessary
he
had
made
himself
and
imploring
him
for
our
sakes
to
behave
like
a
gentleman
but
supposing
supposing
he
was
innocent
that
he
had
never
meant
she
put
out
a
hand
to
lay
it
on
her
brother
hush
she
could
have
cried
but
it
was
too
late
endymion
narcissus
called
across
the
room
jocosely
eh
what
is
it
endymion
came
out
of
his
doze
we
in
a
mess
with
these
drawings
a
complete
mess
and
we
want
master
raoul
fetched
out
of
dartmoor
to
set
us
right
come
now
as
commissary
what
you
take
to
work
it
for
us
fifty
pounds
has
already
been
offered
dorothea
turned
from
the
table
with
a
sigh
for
her
lost
chance
he
like
it
answered
endymion
grimly
but
my
dear
fellow
he
slewed
himself
in
his
chair
for
a
look
around
the
hall
pray
moderate
your
tones
i
particularly
deprecate
levity
on
such
matters
within
possible
hearing
of
the
servants
that
class
of
person
never
understands
a
joke
narcissus
rubbed
the
top
of
his
head
a
trick
of
his
in
perplexity
but
seriously
it
has
only
this
moment
occurred
to
me
could
the
drawings
be
conveyed
to
him
in
due
form
through
the
commandant
of
the
prison
the
poor
fellow
owes
us
no
grudge
i
believe
he
would
be
eager
to
do
us
this
small
service
and
really
they
have
made
such
a
mess
of
the
stones
impossible
out
of
the
question
and
i
may
say
now
and
once
for
all
that
the
mention
of
that
unhappy
youth
is
repugnant
to
me
by
good
fortune
we
escaped
being
compromised
by
him
and
i
have
refrained
from
reminding
you
that
your
patronage
of
him
was
to
say
the
least
indiscreet
god
bless
me
you
do
suggest
i
hope
that
i
encouraged
him
to
escape
i
suggest
nothing
but
i
am
honestly
glad
to
be
quit
of
him
and
take
some
satisfaction
in
remembering
that
i
detested
the
fellow
from
the
first
he
had
too
much
cleverness
with
his
bad
style
or
if
you
prefer
it
was
sufficiently
like
a
gentleman
to
be
dangerous
pah
for
his
particular
offence
i
would
have
had
the
old
hulks
maintained
in
the
hamoaze
with
all
their
severities
as
it
is
the
posturer
may
find
dartmoor
pretty
stiff
but
will
yet
have
the
consolation
of
herding
with
his
betters
strangely
enough
this
speech
did
more
to
fix
dorothea
resolve
than
all
she
had
read
or
heard
of
the
rigours
of
the
gently
reared
though
she
was
physical
suffering
seemed
to
her
less
intolerable
than
to
be
unjustly
held
in
this
extreme
of
this
was
the
deeper
wrong
and
putting
herself
in
her
lover
place
feeling
with
his
feelings
she
knew
it
to
be
by
far
the
deeper
in
dartmoor
he
shared
the
sufferings
of
men
unfortunate
but
not
despicable
punished
for
fighting
in
their
country
cause
but
here
was
a
moral
punishment
deserved
by
none
but
the
vilest
and
she
had
helped
to
bring
it
was
allowing
it
to
rest
upon
a
hero
in
the
long
watches
of
that
night
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
the
brutality
of
her
brother
contempt
was
and
endymion
not
given
to
at
any
time
was
probably
unconscious
of
a
dull
wrath
revenging
itself
for
many
of
master
clever
tongue
endymion
westcote
like
many
pompous
men
usually
hurt
somebody
when
he
indulged
in
a
joke
and
for
this
cause
perhaps
had
a
nervous
dislike
of
wit
in
others
dull
in
taking
a
jest
but
almost
preternaturally
clever
in
suspecting
one
he
had
disliked
sallies
in
proportion
as
they
puzzled
him
the
remembrance
of
them
rankled
and
this
had
been
his
of
revenge
he
spent
the
next
morning
in
his
office
and
returning
at
three
in
the
afternoon
retired
to
the
library
to
draw
up
the
usual
monthly
report
required
of
him
as
commissary
he
had
been
writing
tor
an
hour
or
more
when
dorothea
tapped
at
the
door
and
entered
endymion
did
not
observe
her
pallor
indeed
he
scarcely
looked
up
ah
you
have
come
for
a
book
make
as
little
noise
then
as
possible
that
a
good
soul
you
interrupted
me
in
a
column
of
figures
he
began
to
add
them
up
afresh
tapping
the
table
with
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
as
his
custom
was
when
counting
dorothea
waited
the
addition
made
he
entered
it
resting
three
shapely
on
the
table
edge
for
the
number
to
be
carried
over
i
wish
to
speak
with
you
particularly
he
laid
down
his
pen
resignedly
her
voice
was
urgent
and
he
knew
well
enough
that
the
occasion
must
be
urgent
when
dorothea
interrupted
his
work
anything
wrong
it
it
about
m
raoul
his
eyebrows
went
up
but
only
to
contract
again
upon
a
magisterial
frown
really
after
the
request
i
was
obliged
to
make
to
narcissus
last
night
you
were
present
i
believe
is
it
possible
that
i
failed
to
make
plain
my
distaste
ah
but
listen
it
is
no
question
of
distaste
but
of
a
great
wrong
he
was
not
trying
to
escape
he
told
you
an
untruth
to
to
save
endymion
had
picked
up
a
and
leaned
back
tapping
his
teeth
with
it
do
you
know
he
said
i
suspected
something
of
this
kind
from
the
first
though
i
had
no
idea
you
shared
the
knowledge
cleverness
struck
me
as
a
trifle
too
ah
phenomenal
for
belief
i
scented
some
low
intrigue
and
polly
dismissal
may
indicate
my
pretty
shrewd
guess
at
the
culprit
but
it
was
not
polly
eh
endymion
sat
bolt
upright
you
must
not
blame
polly
it
was
i
whom
raoul
came
to
see
that
night
he
stared
at
her
incredulous
my
dear
dorothea
are
you
quite
insane
he
wished
to
see
me
to
speak
with
me
he
gave
the
girl
a
note
for
me
i
knew
nothing
about
it
until
i
went
upstairs
that
night
and
found
her
at
the
boudoir
window
raoul
was
outside
he
had
arrived
before
she
could
deliver
the
message
quite
so
with
a
nasally
derisive
laugh
and
you
really
need
me
to
point
out
how
prettily
those
turtles
were
befooling
you
indeed
no
it
was
not
that
he
struck
the
table
impatiently
with
the
my
dear
woman
do
exert
some
common
sense
what
in
the
name
of
wonder
could
the
fellow
have
to
discuss
with
you
at
that
hour
your
pardon
if
finding
no
apparent
limits
to
your
innocence
i
assume
it
to
be
illimitable
and
point
out
that
he
would
scarcely
break
bounds
and
play
romeo
beneath
the
window
of
a
lady
for
the
purpose
of
discussing
with
her
or
the
exploits
of
vespasian
the
taunt
brought
red
to
dorothea
cheeks
and
stung
her
into
courage
he
came
to
see
me
she
persisted
her
voice
dropped
a
little
i
had
come
to
feel
a
regard
for
raoul
and
he
she
could
not
go
on
her
eyes
met
her
brother
for
a
moment
then
fell
before
them
what
she
expected
she
could
not
tell
certainly
she
did
not
expect
what
happened
and
his
sudden
laughter
smote
her
like
a
whip
it
broke
in
a
shout
of
high
incontrollable
mirth
and
he
leaned
back
and
shook
in
his
chair
until
the
tears
streamed
down
his
cheeks
you
he
gasped
you
oh
oh
oh
she
stood
beneath
the
scourge
silent
she
felt
it
curl
across
and
bite
the
very
flesh
and
thought
it
was
killing
her
her
bosom
heaved
it
ceased
he
sat
upright
again
wiping
his
eyes
but
it
incredible
he
protested
the
scoundrel
has
fooled
you
all
along
yes
of
course
he
pondered
that
explains
the
success
of
the
trick
which
otherwise
was
clumsy
beyond
belief
in
fact
its
clumsiness
puzzled
me
but
how
was
i
to
guess
he
pulled
himself
up
on
the
edge
of
another
guffaw
look
here
dorothea
be
sensible
clear
as
daylight
the
fellow
was
after
polly
and
made
you
his
paw
face
it
my
dear
face
it
and
conquer
your
illusions
i
understand
it
must
cost
you
some
suffering
but
after
all
you
must
find
some
blame
in
yourself
in
your
heart
i
mean
not
in
your
conduct
doubtless
your
conduct
showed
weakness
or
he
would
never
have
dared
but
there
i
can
trust
my
sister
face
it
the
thing
absurd
you
a
woman
of
or
is
it
and
he
if
i
may
judge
from
appearances
young
enough
to
be
your
son
polly
was
his
game
the
deceitful
little
slut
you
must
see
it
for
yourself
and
after
all
it
more
natural
immoral
i
no
doubt
he
paused
in
the
middle
of
his
harangue
a
parliamentary
candidate
unsuccessful
for
axcester
had
once
dared
to
poke
fun
at
endymion
westcote
for
having
asserted
in
a
public
speech
that
indecency
was
worse
than
immorality
for
the
life
of
him
endymion
could
never
see
where
the
joke
came
in
but
the
fellow
had
illustrated
it
with
such
a
wealth
of
humorous
instances
and
had
kept
his
ignorant
audience
for
twenty
minutes
in
such
fits
of
laughter
that
he
never
afterwards
approached
the
antithesis
but
he
skirted
it
with
a
red
face
and
dorothea
the
scourge
might
cut
into
her
heart
it
could
not
reach
the
image
of
raoul
she
shielded
there
she
knew
her
lover
too
well
and
that
he
was
incapable
of
this
baseness
but
the
injurious
charge
diverted
from
him
fell
upon
her
own
defences
and
breaking
them
let
in
the
cruel
light
at
length
on
her
passion
her
folly
this
was
how
the
world
would
see
yes
raoul
was
right
there
is
no
enemy
comparable
with
time
looks
fortune
birth
breed
unequal
hearts
and
minds
all
these
love
may
confound
and
play
with
but
time
which
divides
the
dead
from
the
living
sets
easily
between
youth
and
age
a
gulf
which
not
only
forbids
love
but
derides
age
i
do
abhor
thee
youth
i
do
adore
thee
o
my
love
my
love
is
young
she
could
give
counsel
sympathy
care
could
delight
in
his
delights
hope
in
his
hopes
melt
with
his
woes
and
having
wept
a
little
find
comfort
for
them
she
could
thrill
at
his
footsteps
blush
at
his
salutation
sit
happily
beside
him
and
talk
or
be
silent
reading
his
moods
he
might
fill
her
waking
day
haunt
her
dreams
in
the
end
pass
into
prison
for
her
sake
having
crowned
love
with
martyrdom
and
the
world
would
laugh
as
endymion
had
laughed
her
hands
went
up
to
shut
out
the
roar
of
it
a
coarse
amour
with
polly
that
could
be
understood
polly
was
young
polly
what
will
you
do
she
heard
herself
asking
and
could
scarcely
believe
the
voice
belonged
to
her
do
why
if
my
theory
be
right
and
i
hope
i
convinced
you
i
see
no
use
in
meddling
the
girl
is
respectably
married
it
will
cause
her
quite
unnecessary
trouble
if
we
rip
this
affair
open
again
her
husband
will
have
just
ground
for
complaint
and
it
might
i
need
not
point
out
be
a
little
awkward
eh
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
dorothea
regarded
her
brother
with
something
like
contempt
but
the
flash
gave
way
to
a
look
of
weary
resolve
then
i
must
tell
the
truth
to
others
she
said
it
confounded
him
for
a
moment
but
although
here
was
a
new
dorothea
belying
all
experience
his
instinct
for
handling
men
and
women
told
him
at
once
what
had
happened
he
had
driven
her
too
far
he
was
even
clever
enough
to
foresee
that
winning
her
back
to
obedience
would
be
a
ticklish
almost
desperate
business
and
even
sensitive
enough
to
redden
at
his
blunder
you
do
not
agree
with
my
view
he
asked
tapping
the
table
slowly
i
disbelieve
it
i
have
no
right
to
believe
it
even
if
i
had
the
power
he
is
in
prison
you
must
help
me
to
set
him
free
if
not
he
can
not
possibly
return
to
axcester
oh
what
is
that
to
me
she
cried
with
sudden
impatience
then
her
tone
fell
back
to
its
dull
level
i
have
not
been
pleading
for
myself
no
no
i
understand
his
brow
cleared
as
a
man
who
faces
a
bad
business
and
resolves
to
go
through
with
it
well
there
is
only
one
way
to
spare
you
and
everyone
we
must
get
him
a
cartel
a
cartel
yes
get
him
exchanged
and
sent
home
to
his
friends
the
war
office
owes
me
something
and
will
no
doubt
oblige
me
in
a
small
affair
like
this
without
asking
questions
oh
certainly
it
can
be
managed
i
will
write
at
once
chapter
x
dartmoor
dorothea
had
the
profoundest
faith
in
her
brother
ability
that
he
hit
at
once
on
this
simple
solution
which
had
eluded
her
through
many
wakeful
nights
did
not
surprise
her
in
the
least
nor
did
she
doubt
for
a
moment
that
he
would
manage
it
as
he
promised
but
she
could
not
thank
him
he
had
beaten
her
spirit
sorely
so
sorely
that
for
days
her
whole
body
ached
with
the
bruise
she
did
not
accuse
him
her
one
flash
of
contempt
had
lasted
for
an
instant
only
and
the
old
habit
of
reverence
quickly
effaced
it
but
he
had
exposed
her
weakness
had
forced
her
to
see
it
naked
and
pitiful
with
no
chivalry
either
manly
or
brotherly
covering
it
and
seeing
it
with
nothing
to
depend
upon
she
learned
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
the
high
stern
lesson
of
independence
she
learned
it
unconsciously
but
she
never
forgot
it
and
it
is
to
endymion
credit
that
he
recognised
the
great
alteration
and
allowed
for
it
he
had
driven
her
too
far
she
would
never
again
be
the
same
dorothea
and
never
again
by
word
or
look
did
he
remind
her
of
that
hour
of
abasement
an
exchange
of
prisoners
was
not
to
be
managed
in
a
day
and
would
take
weeks
perhaps
six
weeks
or
a
couple
of
months
he
discussed
this
with
her
quietly
as
a
matter
of
business
entrusted
to
him
explained
what
steps
he
had
taken
what
letters
he
had
written
when
he
expected
definite
news
from
the
war
office
she
met
him
on
the
same
ground
yes
he
could
not
have
done
better
she
trusted
him
absolutely
and
in
fact
he
had
been
better
than
his
word
ultimate
success
to
be
sure
was
certain
it
were
strange
if
westcote
who
had
opened
his
purse
to
support
a
troop
of
yeomanry
who
held
two
parliamentary
seats
at
the
government
service
and
two
members
at
call
to
bully
the
war
office
whenever
he
desired
who
might
at
any
time
have
had
a
baronetcy
for
the
asking
it
were
strange
indeed
if
westcote
could
not
obtain
so
trivial
a
favour
as
the
exchange
of
a
prisoner
he
could
do
this
but
he
could
not
appreciably
hurry
the
correspondence
by
which
pall
mall
bargained
a
frenchman
in
the
forest
of
dartmoor
against
an
englishman
in
the
fortress
of
briançon
in
the
hautes
alpes
foreseeing
delays
he
had
written
privately
to
the
commandant
at
dartmoor
a
major
sotheby
with
whom
he
had
some
slight
acquaintance
advising
him
of
his
efforts
and
requesting
him
to
show
the
prisoner
meanwhile
all
possible
indulgence
the
letter
contained
a
draft
for
ten
pounds
to
be
spent
upon
small
comforts
at
the
commandant
discretion
but
raoul
was
not
to
be
informed
of
the
donor
or
of
his
approaching
liberty
in
theory
such
was
the
routine
raoul
remained
one
of
the
axcester
contingent
of
prisoners
and
all
reports
concerning
him
must
pass
through
the
commissary
hands
in
the
last
week
of
october
when
brother
and
sister
daily
expected
the
cartel
arrived
a
report
that
the
prisoner
was
in
hospital
with
a
sharp
attack
of
pleurisy
major
sotheby
added
a
private
note
i
feared
yesterday
that
the
exchange
would
come
too
late
for
him
but
the
medical
officer
who
has
just
left
me
speaks
hopefully
i
have
no
doubt
however
that
a
winter
in
this
climate
would
be
fatal
the
fellow
lungs
are
breaking
down
and
even
if
they
could
stand
the
fogs
the
cold
must
finish
him
dorothea
stood
by
a
window
in
the
library
when
endymion
read
this
out
to
her
the
very
window
through
which
she
had
been
gazing
that
spring
morning
when
raoul
first
kissed
her
the
first
of
the
snow
fell
gently
persistently
out
of
a
leaden
and
windless
sky
she
turned
i
must
go
to
him
she
said
but
to
what
purpose
oh
you
may
trust
me
my
dear
girl
that
was
not
in
my
mind
he
spoke
gently
but
until
the
warrant
arrives
we
will
give
it
until
by
every
account
it
should
reach
us
you
shall
take
it
with
me
i
must
see
him
once
more
only
once
in
your
presence
if
you
wish
next
morning
they
rode
into
the
town
together
an
hour
before
the
mail
arrival
endymion
alighted
at
the
town
house
to
write
a
business
letter
or
two
before
strolling
down
to
the
post
office
dorothea
cantered
on
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
then
walked
mercury
to
and
fro
while
she
watched
the
taller
rise
beyond
the
snow
had
ceased
falling
but
a
crisp
north
wind
skimmed
the
drifts
and
powdered
her
dark
habit
twice
she
pulled
out
her
watch
but
the
coach
was
up
to
time
in
spite
of
the
heavy
roads
and
as
it
topped
the
rise
she
reined
mercury
to
the
and
cantered
back
to
await
it
already
the
street
had
begun
to
fill
as
usual
and
as
usual
there
was
general
rochambeau
picking
his
way
along
the
pavement
to
present
himself
for
the
letter
the
letter
which
never
arrived
would
letter
never
arrive
he
halted
on
the
kerb
by
her
stirrup
she
asked
after
the
health
ah
mademoiselle
if
ever
he
leaves
his
bed
again
it
will
be
a
miracle
she
was
not
listening
age
age
again
it
makes
all
the
difference
here
came
the
coach
did
it
hold
a
letter
for
raoul
raoul
was
young
the
coach
rolled
by
with
less
noise
than
usual
on
the
carpet
of
snow
churned
brown
with
traffic
as
it
passed
the
guard
lifted
his
horn
and
blew
cheerily
she
followed
telling
herself
it
was
a
good
omen
during
the
long
wait
outside
the
post
office
she
rebuked
herself
more
than
once
for
building
a
hope
upon
it
name
after
name
was
called
and
at
each
call
a
prisoner
pushed
forward
to
the
doorway
for
his
letter
she
caught
sight
of
the
general
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
her
brother
would
not
come
out
until
every
letter
had
been
distributed
but
when
he
appeared
in
the
doorway
she
read
the
good
news
in
his
face
he
made
his
way
briskly
towards
her
the
prisoners
falling
back
to
give
passage
right
it
has
come
he
said
trot
away
home
and
have
the
valises
packed
while
i
run
into
dogs
and
order
the
chaise
once
clear
of
the
town
she
galloped
there
was
little
need
to
hurry
for
her
own
valise
had
been
packed
overnight
having
sent
mudge
to
attend
to
her
brother
she
ran
to
room
his
scriptorium
as
he
called
it
narcissus
was
at
home
busy
with
the
cellar
accounts
he
took
stock
twice
a
year
and
composed
a
report
in
language
worthy
of
a
survey
of
the
roman
empire
before
he
could
look
up
dorothea
had
kissed
him
on
the
crown
of
his
venerable
head
such
news
dear
endymion
has
ordered
a
chaise
from
dogs
and
is
going
to
take
me
to
dartmoor
dartmoor
god
bless
my
soul
he
rubbed
his
head
and
added
with
a
twinkle
why
what
have
you
been
doing
endymion
has
a
cartel
of
exchange
for
raoul
and
we
are
to
carry
it
ah
so
that
is
what
you
two
have
been
conspiring
over
i
smelt
a
rat
somewhere
but
really
this
is
delightful
of
you
delightful
of
you
both
only
why
on
earth
should
you
be
carrying
the
release
yourselves
in
this
weather
he
is
very
ill
said
dorothea
seriously
indeed
poor
fellow
poor
fellow
still
that
scarcely
explains
and
you
will
be
good
and
take
your
meals
regularly
when
mudge
beats
the
gong
and
you
wo
sit
up
late
and
set
fire
to
the
house
but
i
must
run
off
and
tell
everyone
to
take
care
of
you
she
kissed
him
again
and
was
down
the
corridor
before
he
called
after
her
dorothea
dorothea
the
drawings
ah
to
be
sure
i
forgot
she
murmured
as
he
thrust
the
parcel
into
her
hand
forgot
forgot
the
drawings
but
god
bless
my
soul
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
grey
hairs
and
stared
down
the
corridor
after
her
the
roads
were
heavy
to
start
with
and
beyond
chard
they
grew
heavier
at
honiton
which
our
travellers
reached
at
midnight
it
was
snowing
and
dorothea
when
the
sleepy
aroused
her
at
dawn
looked
out
upon
a
forbidding
world
of
white
the
postboys
were
growling
and
she
half
feared
that
endymion
would
abandon
the
journey
for
the
day
but
if
he
lacked
her
zeal
he
had
the
true
hatred
of
turning
back
she
who
had
known
him
always
for
a
master
of
men
learned
a
new
awe
of
her
splendid
brother
he
took
command
he
landlord
and
postboys
their
objections
extracted
from
them
in
curt
questions
more
information
than
five
minutes
before
they
were
conscious
of
possessing
to
judge
from
the
scratching
of
heads
which
produced
it
finally
he
handed
dorothea
into
the
chaise
sprang
in
himself
and
closed
discussion
with
a
slam
of
the
door
they
were
driven
off
amid
the
salaams
of
ostler
boots
waiter
and
two
chambermaids
among
whom
he
had
scattered
largess
with
the
lordliest
hand
so
the
chaise
ploughed
through
exeter
to
moreton
hampstead
where
they
supped
and
rested
for
another
night
but
before
dawn
they
were
off
again
snow
lay
in
thick
drifts
on
the
skirts
of
the
great
moor
and
snow
whirled
about
them
as
they
climbed
until
day
broke
upon
a
howling
desert
across
which
dorothea
peered
but
could
discern
no
features
not
leagues
but
years
divided
bayfield
from
this
tableland
high
over
all
the
world
uninhabited
without
tree
or
gate
or
hedge
her
eyes
were
heavy
with
lack
of
sleep
smarting
with
the
bite
of
the
north
wind
which
neither
ceased
nor
eased
until
towards
ten
the
carriage
began
to
lumber
downhill
towards
two
bridges
under
the
lee
of
crockern
tor
beyond
came
a
heavy
piece
of
collar
work
the
horses
dropping
to
a
walk
as
they
heaved
through
the
drifts
towards
a
depression
between
two
tors
closing
the
view
ahead
dorothea
eyes
avoiding
the
wind
were
fixed
on
the
tor
to
the
left
when
endymion
touched
her
hand
and
pointed
towards
the
base
of
the
other
there
grey
almost
black
against
the
white
hillside
a
mass
of
masonry
loomed
up
through
the
weather
the
great
circle
of
the
war
prison
the
road
did
not
lead
them
to
it
direct
they
must
halt
first
at
the
bare
village
of
prince
town
and
drink
coffee
and
warm
themselves
at
the
plume
of
feathers
inn
before
facing
the
last
few
hundred
yards
beneath
the
lee
of
north
hessary
but
a
little
before
noon
dorothea
still
with
a
sense
of
being
lifted
on
a
platform
miles
above
the
world
she
knew
alighted
before
a
tremendous
archway
of
piled
granite
set
in
a
featureless
wall
and
closed
with
a
sheeted
gate
of
iron
a
coated
sentry
pacing
here
in
front
of
his
box
challenged
and
demanded
their
business
visitors
for
the
commandant
the
sentry
tugged
at
an
iron
bellpull
and
a
bell
tolled
twice
within
dorothea
feet
were
in
spite
of
her
wraps
she
stamped
them
in
the
snow
while
she
studied
the
gateway
and
the
enormous
blocks
which
arched
it
unhewn
save
for
two
words
carved
in
roman
capitals
parcere
subjectis
a
key
turned
in
the
wicket
visitors
for
the
commandant
they
stepped
through
and
after
pausing
a
moment
while
the
porter
shot
the
lock
again
behind
them
followed
him
across
the
yard
to
the
commandant
quarters
the
outer
wall
of
the
great
war
prison
enclosed
a
circle
of
thirty
acres
within
it
a
second
wall
surrounded
an
acre
in
which
stood
the
five
rectangular
blocks
of
the
prison
proper
with
two
slightly
smaller
buildings
the
one
a
hospital
the
other
set
apart
for
the
petty
officers
and
between
the
inner
and
outer
walls
ran
a
close
on
a
mile
in
circumference
constantly
paraded
by
the
guard
and
having
raised
platforms
from
which
the
sentinels
could
overlook
the
inner
wall
and
the
area
the
area
was
not
completely
circular
since
where
it
faced
the
great
gate
a
segment
had
been
cut
out
of
it
for
the
commandant
quarters
and
outbuildings
and
the
entrance
yard
across
which
our
travellers
now
followed
their
guide
the
commandant
hurried
out
from
his
office
to
welcome
them
a
bustling
little
officer
with
sandy
hair
and
the
kindliest
possible
face
a
trifle
obviously
proud
of
his
prison
and
after
a
fashion
of
his
prisoners
too
anxiously
elaborately
polite
in
his
manner
especially
towards
dorothea
major
westcote
he
gave
endymion
his
full
title
my
dear
sir
this
is
indeed
and
miss
westcote
he
bowed
as
he
was
introduced
delighted
honoured
but
what
a
journey
you
must
be
famished
positively
you
will
be
wanting
luncheon
at
once
yes
really
you
must
allow
me
no
a
glass
of
sherry
then
and
a
biscuit
at
least
he
ran
to
the
door
called
to
his
orderly
to
bring
some
glasses
and
came
back
rubbing
his
hands
it
an
ill
wind
as
they
say
we
have
come
with
the
order
about
which
we
have
corresponded
for
that
poor
fellow
raoul
the
commandant
nodded
gaily
and
smiled
and
dorothea
who
had
been
watching
his
face
felt
the
load
dissolve
and
roll
off
her
heart
as
a
pile
of
snow
slides
from
a
bough
in
the
sunshine
he
is
better
i
am
glad
to
report
out
of
bed
and
fairly
convalescent
indeed
but
i
hope
my
message
did
not
alarm
you
needlessly
it
was
with
him
for
hours
still
he
was
bettering
when
i
wrote
and
to
bring
you
all
this
way
and
in
such
weather
my
sister
and
i
explained
endymion
take
a
particular
interest
in
his
case
but
the
voluble
officer
was
not
so
easily
silenced
so
to
be
sure
i
gathered
he
bowed
gallantly
to
dorothea
woman
in
our
hours
of
ease
uncertain
coy
and
hard
to
please
not
of
course
that
i
attribute
any
such
foibles
to
miss
westcote
but
for
the
sake
of
the
conclusion
can
we
see
him
eh
before
luncheon
oh
most
assuredly
if
you
wish
it
he
has
been
transferred
to
the
convalescents
ward
we
will
step
across
at
once
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
small
attached
by
a
steel
chain
to
his
belt
and
blew
into
the
wards
thoughtfully
while
he
studied
the
paper
handed
to
him
by
endymion
quite
in
order
of
course
no
doubt
you
and
miss
westcote
would
prefer
to
break
the
good
news
to
him
in
private
yes
yes
i
will
have
him
sent
up
to
the
consulting
room
the
doctor
has
finished
his
morning
rounds
and
you
will
be
quite
alone
there
he
picked
up
his
cap
and
escorted
them
out
and
across
the
court
to
the
gate
of
the
main
prison
beyond
this
dorothea
found
herself
in
a
vast
snowy
yard
along
two
sides
of
which
ran
covered
ways
or
piazzas
open
to
the
air
but
faced
with
iron
bars
and
behind
these
bars
flitted
the
forms
of
the
prisoners
at
exercise
stamping
the
flagged
pavement
to
keep
their
starved
blood
in
circulation
at
a
sight
of
the
commandant
with
his
two
visitors
so
small
a
spectacle
had
power
to
divert
them
all
this
movement
this
stamping
was
hushed
suddenly
voices
broke
into
chatter
faces
appeared
between
the
bars
and
stared
yes
said
the
commandant
reading
dorothea
thought
a
large
family
to
be
responsible
for
how
many
would
you
guess
now
a
thousand
at
least
she
murmured
six
thousand
each
of
those
blocks
yonder
will
accommodate
fifteen
hundred
men
and
then
there
is
the
hospital
usually
pretty
full
at
this
season
i
regret
to
say
come
i
wo
detain
you
but
really
in
passing
you
must
have
a
look
at
one
of
our
dormitories
he
threw
open
a
door
and
she
gazed
in
upon
a
avenue
of
iron
pillars
slung
with
double
tiers
of
hammocks
the
place
seemed
clean
enough
at
the
far
end
of
the
vista
a
fatigue
gang
of
prisoners
was
busy
with
pails
and
brushes
but
either
it
had
not
been
thoroughly
ventilated
or
the
dense
numbers
packed
in
it
for
so
many
hours
a
day
had
given
the
building
an
atmosphere
of
its
own
warm
and
unpleasant
if
not
precisely
foetid
after
the
pure
stinging
air
of
the
moorland
we
can
sleep
seven
hundred
here
said
the
commandant
and
another
dormitory
of
the
same
size
runs
overhead
the
top
story
they
use
as
a
promenade
and
for
indoor
recreation
he
pointed
to
a
number
of
grilles
set
in
the
wall
at
the
back
at
equal
distances
for
air
he
explained
and
also
for
keeping
watch
on
yes
we
find
that
necessary
behind
each
is
a
small
chamber
hollowed
most
scientifically
quite
a
little
temple
of
acoustics
if
miss
westcote
now
would
care
to
step
into
one
and
listen
while
i
stand
below
with
the
major
and
converse
in
ordinary
tones
no
no
dorothea
declined
hurriedly
and
with
a
shiver
it
hurt
her
to
think
of
raoul
herded
among
seven
hundred
miserables
in
this
endless
barrack
his
every
movement
overlooked
his
smallest
speech
overheard
by
an
sentry
i
think
endymion
chimed
in
my
sister
feels
her
long
journey
and
would
be
glad
to
get
our
business
over
ah
to
be
sure
a
thousand
pardons
the
commandant
shut
the
door
and
piloted
them
across
to
the
hospital
block
here
on
the
threshold
the
same
warm
acrid
atmosphere
assailed
dorothea
nostrils
and
almost
choked
her
breathing
their
guide
led
the
way
up
a
flight
of
stone
steps
to
the
first
floor
and
down
a
whitewashed
corridor
lit
along
one
side
with
narrow
barred
casements
a
little
more
than
down
the
corridor
the
blank
wall
facing
these
casements
was
pierced
by
a
low
arched
passage
into
this
burrow
the
commandant
dived
and
standing
outside
they
heard
a
key
turned
in
a
lock
he
reappeared
and
beckoned
to
them
from
the
gallery
here
he
whispered
you
look
right
down
into
the
convalescent
ward
through
the
iron
bars
of
the
gallery
dorothea
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
long
bare
room
with
twenty
or
thirty
dejected
figures
in
suits
and
caps
of
flannel
huddled
about
a
stove
some
were
playing
at
cards
others
at
dominoes
the
murmur
of
their
voices
ascended
and
hummed
in
the
little
passage
hist
your
friend
is
below
there
if
you
care
to
have
a
peep
at
him
but
dorothea
had
already
drawn
back
all
this
spying
and
listening
revolted
her
the
polite
commandant
noted
the
movement
you
prefer
that
he
should
be
fetched
at
once
he
stepped
past
them
into
the
corridor
smithers
he
called
smithers
a
hospital
orderly
appeared
at
a
door
almost
opposite
the
passage
and
saluted
run
down
to
the
convalescent
ward
and
fetch
up
number
i
know
the
number
of
each
of
my
children
i
never
make
a
mistake
he
confided
in
dorothea
ear
as
quick
as
you
can
please
stay
you
may
add
that
some
visitors
have
called
and
wish
to
speak
with
him
the
orderly
saluted
again
and
hurried
off
you
wish
of
course
to
see
him
alone
together
i
think
answered
endymion
slowly
my
sister
would
prefer
a
word
or
two
with
him
alone
certainly
will
you
step
into
the
surgery
miss
westcote
he
indicated
the
door
at
which
the
orderly
had
appeared
smithers
will
not
take
two
minutes
in
fetching
the
prisoner
and
perhaps
if
you
will
excuse
us
a
visit
to
the
hospital
itself
will
repay
your
brother
we
are
rather
proud
of
our
sanitation
here
a
glance
over
our
arrangements
five
minutes
only
endymion
at
a
nod
from
dorothea
permitted
himself
to
be
led
away
by
the
inexorable
man
she
watched
them
to
the
end
of
the
corridor
and
had
her
hand
on
the
surgery
door
to
push
it
open
when
a
voice
from
below
smote
her
ears
number
to
come
to
the
surgery
at
once
to
see
visitors
the
voice
rang
up
through
the
little
passage
behind
her
she
turned
the
door
at
the
end
of
it
stood
beyond
it
she
saw
the
bars
of
the
gallery
and
through
these
a
space
of
whitewashed
wall
at
the
end
of
the
ward
she
was
turning
again
when
a
babble
of
voices
answered
the
announcement
raoul
raoul
were
calling
and
then
one
spoke
up
sharp
and
distinct
tenez

that
what
asking
dorothea
put
out
a
hand
against
the
jamb
of
the
surgery
door
to
steady
herself
she
heard
the
smack
of
a
palm
below
and
some
one
uttered
a
groan
enfoncé

burst
out
singing

the
cheerful
epithet
he
bestowed
on

dorothea
had
stepped
into
the
surgery
a
small
round
table
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
she
caught
at
the
edge
of
it
and
rested
so
for
a
moment
for
the
walls
seemed
to
be
swaying
and
she
durst
not
lift
her
hands
to
shut
out
the
roars
of
laughter
they
rang
in
her
ears
and
shouted
and
stunned
her
her
whole
body
writhed
the
hubbub
below
sank
to
a
confused
murmur
she
heard
footsteps
in
the
corridor
the
firm
tramp
of
the
orderly
followed
by
the
shuffle
of
list
slippers
number
is
outside
am
i
to
show
him
in
she
bent
her
head
and
moved
towards
the
fireplace
she
heard
him
shuffle
in
and
the
door
shut
behind
him
still
she
did
not
turn
dorothea
his
voice
shook
with
joy
with
passion
how
well
she
knew
that
deep
provençal
tremolo
she
could
have
laughed
aloud
in
her
bitterness
dorothea
she
faced
him
at
length
he
stood
there
stretching
out
both
hands
to
her
he
was
handsome
as
ever
but
pale
and
sadly
pinched
beyond
all
doubt
he
had
suffered
his
hospital
suit
hung
about
him
in
folds
in
her
eyes
he
read
at
once
that
something
was
wrong
but
without
comprehending
you
sent
for
me
he
stammered
you
have
come
she
found
her
voice
and
to
her
surprise
it
was
quite
firm
yes
we
have
brought
your
release
she
said
and
watching
his
eyes
saw
the
joy
leap
up
in
them
saw
it
quenched
the
next
instant
as
he
composed
his
features
to
a
fond
solicitude
for
her
but
you
he
murmured
what
has
happened
tell
me
no
do
not
draw
away
your
hand
at
least
contempt
for
herself
or
for
him
gave
her
a
moment
strength
but
it
broke
down
again
it
is
horrible
was
all
she
answered
and
looked
about
her
with
a
shiver
ah
the
place
frightens
you
well
he
laughed
reassuringly
it
frightened
me
at
first
but
for
the
thought
of
you
dearest
to
comfort
she
stepped
past
him
and
opened
the
door
for
a
moment
a
wild
notion
seized
him
that
she
was
escaping
and
he
put
out
an
imploring
hand
but
he
saw
that
with
her
hand
on
the
jamb
she
was
listening
and
he
too
listened
the
voices
in
the
convalescent
ward
came
up
to
them
scarcely
muffled
through
the
low
passage
and
with
them
a
cackling
laugh
then
he
understood
their
eyes
met
he
bowed
his
head
nevertheless
i
have
suffered
he
said
it
humbly
after
many
seconds
and
in
a
voice
so
low
that
it
seemed
a
second
or
two
before
she
heard
for
the
first
time
she
put
out
a
hand
and
touched
his
sleeve
yes
you
have
suffered
and
for
me
let
me
go
on
believing
that
you
did
a
noble
thing
and
i
shall
try
to
remember
you
by
it
to
remember
that
you
were
capable
of
it
was
for
my
sake
i
shall
say
and
then
i
shall
be
proud
oh
yes
sometimes
i
shall
be
very
proud
but
in
love
her
voice
faltered
and
he
looked
up
sharply
in
love
she
smiled
but
passing
faintly
it
the
little
things
is
it
not
it
the
little
things
that
count
she
touched
his
sleeve
again
and
passed
into
the
room
leaving
him
there
at
a
standstill
as
endymion
and
the
commandant
came
round
the
corner
at
the
far
end
of
the
corridor
excuse
me
said
endymion
and
stepping
past
raoul
without
a
glance
looked
into
the
surgery
after
a
moment
he
shut
the
door
quietly
and
standing
with
his
back
to
it
addressed
the
prisoner
i
perceive
sir
that
my
sister
has
told
you
the
news
we
have
effected
an
exchange
for
you
and
the
commandant
tells
me
that
if
the
roads
permit
you
will
be
sent
down
to
plymouth
and
released
it
is
unnecessary
for
you
to
thank
me
it
would
indeed
be
offensive
i
wish
you
a
safe
passage
home
and
pray
heaven
to
spare
me
the
annoyance
of
seeing
your
face
again
as
raoul
bowed
and
moved
away
dragging
his
feet
weakly
in
their
list
slippers
westcote
turned
to
the
commandant
who
during
this
address
had
kept
a
discreet
distance
with
your
leave
we
will
continue
our
stroll
and
return
for
my
sister
in
a
few
minutes
the
commandant
jumped
at
the
suggestion
dorothea
heard
their
footsteps
retreating
and
knew
that
her
thoughtfulness
had
found
her
this
short
respite
she
had
dropped
into
the
orderly
chair
and
now
bowed
her
head
upon
the
prison
ledger
which
lay
open
on
the
table
before
it
oh
my
love
how
could
you
do
it
how
could
you
how
could
you
chapter
xi
the
new
dorothea
two
hours
later
they
set
out
on
their
homeward
journey
the
commandant
still
voluble
escorted
them
to
the
gate
as
dorothea
climbed
into
the
chaise
and
endymion
shook
up
the
rugs
and
cushions
a
large
parcel
rolled
out
upon
the
snow
she
gave
a
little
cry
of
dismay
the
drawings
eh
we
forgot
to
deliver
them
oh
confound
the
things
endymion
was
for
pitching
them
back
into
the
chaise
but
no
she
entreated
why
narcissus
believes
it
was
to
deliver
them
that
we
came
so
the
commandant
amiably
charged
himself
to
hand
the
parcel
to
raoul
and
waved
his
adieux
with
it
as
the
chaise
rolled
away
of
what
had
passed
between
dorothea
and
raoul
at
the
surgery
door
endymion
knew
nothing
but
he
had
guessed
at
once
and
now
was
assured
by
the
tone
in
which
she
had
spoken
of
the
drawings
that
the
chapter
was
closed
the
danger
past
coming
brother
and
sister
had
scarcely
exchanged
a
word
for
miles
together
now
they
found
themselves
chatting
without
effort
about
the
landscape
the
horses
pace
the
commandant
and
his
hospitality
the
arrangements
of
the
prison
and
the
prospects
of
a
cosy
dinner
at
moreton
hampstead
it
was
all
the
smallest
of
small
talk
and
just
what
might
be
expected
of
two
reputable
persons
returning
in
a
from
a
mild
jaunt
yet
beneath
it
ran
a
current
of
feeling
in
their
different
ways
each
had
been
moved
each
had
relied
upon
the
other
for
a
degree
of
help
which
could
not
be
asked
in
words
and
had
not
been
disappointed
now
that
dorothea
infatuation
had
escaped
all
risk
of
public
laughter
endymion
could
find
leisure
to
admire
her
courage
in
confessing
in
persisting
until
the
wrong
was
righted
and
now
at
the
last
in
shutting
the
door
upon
the
whole
episode
and
now
at
the
last
having
shut
the
door
upon
it
dorothea
could
reflect
that
her
brother
too
had
suffered
she
knew
his
pride
his
sensitiveness
his
mortal
dread
of
ridicule
in
the
smart
of
his
wound
he
had
turned
and
rent
her
cruelly
but
had
recovered
himself
and
defended
her
loyally
from
worse
rendings
she
remembered
too
that
he
had
distrusted
raoul
from
the
first
he
had
been
right
but
had
she
been
wholly
wrong
in
the
dusk
of
the
fifth
evening
after
their
departure
the
chaise
rolled
briskly
in
through
bayfield
great
gates
and
up
the
snowy
drive
almost
noiselessly
though
it
came
mudge
had
the
door
thrown
wide
and
stood
ready
to
welcome
them
with
narcissus
behind
in
the
comfortable
glow
of
the
hall
dorothea
limbs
were
stiff
and
on
alighting
she
steadied
herself
for
a
moment
by
the
before
stepping
in
to
kiss
her
brother
in
that
moment
her
eyes
took
one
backward
glance
across
the
park
and
rested
on
the
lights
of
axcester
glimmering
between
the
naked
elms
well
demanded
narcissus
after
exchange
of
greetings
and
what
did
he
say
about
the
drawings
dorothea
had
not
expected
the
question
in
this
form
and
parried
it
with
a
laugh
you
and
your
drawings
i
declare
she
turned
to
endymion
he
has
been
thinking
of
them
all
the
time
and
affects
no
concern
in
our
adventures
which
nevertheless
have
been
romantic
to
the
last
degree
he
added
playing
up
to
her
my
dear
dorothea
narcissus
expostulated
but
you
are
not
going
to
evade
me
by
any
such
tricks
she
interrupted
sternly
for
that
is
what
it
comes
to
i
left
you
with
the
strictest
orders
to
take
care
of
yourself
and
you
ought
to
know
that
i
shall
answer
nothing
until
you
have
been
catechised
what
have
you
been
eating
my
dorothea
narcissus
gazed
helplessly
at
mudge
but
mudge
had
been
seized
with
a
flurry
of
his
own
and
misinterpreted
the
look
as
well
as
the
stern
question
i
i
reckon
is
miss
he
confessed
being
partial
to
onions
and
taking
that
liberty
in
endymion
absence
knowing
his
dislike
of
the
effluvium
such
are
the
pitfalls
of
a
guilty
conscience
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
of
being
unexpectedly
clever
an
hour
later
at
dinner
narcissus
was
informed
that
the
drawings
had
been
conveyed
to
raoul
who
doubtless
would
return
them
with
hints
for
correction
but
had
he
nothing
to
say
at
the
time
for
my
part
said
endymion
sipping
his
wine
i
addressed
but
one
sentence
to
him
and
dorothea
i
daresay
exchanged
but
half
a
dozen
considering
the
shortness
of
the
interview
and
that
our
mission
at
least
our
ostensible
mission
endymion
glanced
at
dorothea
with
a
smile
at
his
own
was
to
carry
him
news
of
his
release
you
will
admit
oh
ah
to
be
sure
i
had
forgotten
the
release
muttered
narcissus
and
was
resigned
by
the
way
dorothea
asked
after
a
short
pause
what
is
happening
at
dogs
tonight
all
the
windows
are
lit
up
in
the
orange
room
i
saw
it
as
i
stepped
out
of
the
chaise
yes
i
have
to
tell
you
narcissus
turned
towards
his
brother
that
during
your
absence
another
of
the
prisoners
has
found
his
discharge
the
old
admiral
dead
he
died
this
morning
but
you
knew
of
course
it
was
only
a
question
of
days
rochambeau
was
with
him
at
the
last
he
has
shown
great
devotion
you
have
made
all
arrangements
of
course
for
narcissus
was
acting
commissary
in
his
brother
absence
i
rode
in
at
once
on
hearing
the
news
which
zeally
brought
before
daylight
and
found
the
lodge
this
was
a
masonic
lodge
formed
among
the
prisoners
and
named
by
them
paix
anxious
to
pay
him
something
more
than
the
full
rites
with
my
leave
they
have
hired
the
orange
room
and
turned
it
into
a
and
there
i
believe
he
is
reposing
now
poor
old
fellow
he
has
no
kith
nor
kin
i
understand
none
he
was
never
married
and
his
relatives
went
in
the
terror
the
most
of
them
so
rochambeau
tells
me
in
a
single
week
dorothea
had
heard
the
same
story
from
the
general
and
from
raoul
to
this
old
warrior
his
emperor
had
been
friends
kindred
wife
and
children
nay
almost
god
he
had
enjoyed
napoleon
favour
and
followed
his
star
from
the
days
of
the
directory
in
that
favour
and
the
future
of
france
beneath
that
star
his
hopes
had
begun
and
ended
his
private
ambitions
he
had
resigned
without
a
word
on
the
day
when
he
put
to
sea
out
of
brest
under
order
from
paris
to
perform
a
feat
he
knew
to
be
impossible
with
ships
and
victualled
by
cheating
contractors
and
he
sailed
cheerfully
believing
himself
sacrificed
to
some
high
purpose
of
his
master
when
the
sacrifice
made
he
learned
that
the
contractors
slandered
him
to
cover
their
own
villainy
and
that
napoleon
either
believed
them
or
was
indifferent
his
heart
broke
too
proud
at
first
he
had
ended
by
drawing
up
a
statement
and
forwarding
it
from
his
captivity
with
a
demand
for
an
enquiry
the
answer
to
this
was
the
letter
which
never
came
dorothea
thought
of
the
room
where
she
had
danced
and
been
happy
the
many
lights
the
pagan
figures
merrymaking
on
the
panels
the
goddess
on
the
ceiling
with
her
cupids
and
scattered
roses
and
in
the
centre
of
it
all
that
dead
face
incongruous
and
calm
how
small
had
been
her
tribulation
beside
his
and
it
was
all
over
for
him
now

up
for

no
heir
to
trouble
over
him
or
his
good
name
next
morning
she
rode
into
axcester
as
well
to
do
some
light
shopping
as
because
it
seemed
an
age
since
her
last
visit
which
to
be
sure
was
absurd
and
she
knew
it
happening
to
meet
general
rochambeau
she
drew
rein
and
very
gently
offered
her
condolence
on
the
loss
of
his
old
friend
the
general
pressed
her
hand
gratefully
ah
never
pity
him
mademoiselle
he
carries
a
good
pass
for
the
elysian
fields
and
that
is
the
emperor
and
my
faith
miss
dorothea
there
will
be
sneezings
in
certain
quarters
when
he
opens
it
there

has
the
admiral
he
had
for
you
if
i
may
say
it
a
quite
extraordinary
respect
and
affection
the
saints
rest
his
brave
soul
the
general
lifted
his
tricorne
he
never
understood
the
tide
of
red
which
surged
over
dorothea
face
but
she
conquered
it
and
went
on
to
surprise
him
further
i
heard
of
this
only
last
night
we
have
been
visiting
dartmoor
my
brother
and
i
with
a
release
for
for
that
m
raoul
so
i
understood
he
noted
that
her
confusion
had
gone
as
suddenly
as
it
came
but
since
i
am
back
in
time
and
it
appears
i
was
so
fortunate
as
to
win
his
regard
i
would
ask
to
see
him
if
it
be
permitted
and
i
may
have
your
escort
certainly
mademoiselle
you
will
perhaps
wish
to
consult
your
brother
though
i
see
no
necessity
she
answered
the
general
was
not
the
only
one
to
discover
a
new
and
firmer
note
in
dorothea
voice
life
at
bayfield
slipped
back
into
its
old
comfortable
groove
but
the
brothers
fell
and
one
of
them
consciously
into
a
habit
of
including
her
in
their
conversations
and
even
of
asking
her
advice
one
day
there
arrived
a
bulky
parcel
for
narcissus
so
bulky
indeed
and
so
suspiciously
heavy
that
it
bore
signs
of
several
agitated
official
inspections
and
nothing
short
of
official
deference
to
endymion
under
cover
of
whom
it
was
addressed
could
account
for
its
having
come
through
at
all
for
it
came
from
france
it
contained
a
set
of
the
bayfield
drawings
exquisitely
cut
in
stone
and
within
the
cover
was
wrapped
a
lighter
parcel
addressed
to
miss
dorothea
westcote
a
with
a
packet
of
seeds
tied
about
its
root
no
letter
accompanied
the
gift
at
the
sentimentality
of
which
she
found
herself
able
to
smile
but
she
soaked
the
root
carefully
in
warm
water
and
smiled
again
at
herself
as
she
planted
it
at
the
foot
of
the
glacis
beneath
her
boudoir
window
the
very
spot
where
raoul
had
fallen
against
expectation
for
the
journey
had
sorely
withered
it
the
plant
throve
she
lived
to
see
it
grown
into
a
fine
provence
rose
draping
the
whole
corner
of
bayfield
with
its
yellow
bloom
after
all
she
said
one
afternoon
stepping
back
in
the
act
of
pruning
it
provided
one
sees
things
in
their
right
light
and
is
not
a
fool
but
this
was
long
after
the
time
of
which
we
are
telling
folks
no
longer
smile
at
sentiment
they
laugh
it
down
by
which
perhaps
no
great
harm
would
be
done
if
their
laughter
came
through
the
mind
but
it
comes
through
the
passions
and
at
the
best
chastises
one
excess
by
another
a
weakness
by
a
rage
which
is
weakness
at
its
worst
i
fear
dorothea
may
be
injured
in
the
opinion
of
many
by
the
truth
which
nevertheless
has
to
be
told
that
her
recovery
was
helped
not
a
little
by
sentiment
what
is
a
poor
lady
heart
to
be
in
combustion
for
a
while
and
then
pf
the
flame
expelled
at
a
blast
with
all
that
fed
it
that
is
the
heroic
cure
no
doubt
but
either
it
kills
or
leaves
a
room
swept
and
garnished
inviting
devils
in
short
it
is
the
way
of
tragedy
and
for
tragedy
dorothea
had
no
aptitude
at
all
she
did
what
she
could
tidied
up
for
an
she
owned
a
small
book
which
had
once
belonged
to
a
namesake
of
hers
a
dorothea
westcote
who
had
lived
at
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
and
opening
of
the
eighteenth
centuries
a
daughter
of
the
first
westcote
of
bayfield
married
so
said
the
family
history
in
to
a
squire
from
across
the
devonshire
border
the
book
was
a
slender
one
bound
in
calf
and
stamped
with
a
gold
wreath
in
the
centre
of
each
cover
dorothea
called
it
an
album
but
the
original
owner
had
simply
written
in
dorothea
westcote
her
book
on
the
first
page
with
the
date
below
and
filled
twenty
of
its
blank
pages
with
poetry
presumably
her
favourite
pieces
copied
in
a
highly
ornate
hand
presumably
also
she
had
wearied
of
the
work
let
the
book
lie
and
coming
to
it
later
turned
it
upside
down
and
started
with
a
more
useful
purpose
for
three
pages
at
the
end
contained
several
household
recipes
in
the
same
writing
grown
severer
including
garland
wine
massiter
way
and
a
good
cottage
pie
for
a
pore
person
now
the
family
history
left
no
doubt
that
in
this
dorothy
had
been
a
bare
fifteen
years
old
and
although
some
of
the
entries
must
have
been
made
later
for
at
least
two
of
them
had
not
been
composed
at
the
time
the
bulk
of
the
poems
proved
her
a
sprightly
young
lady
whenever
she
transcribed
them
indeed
some
were
so
very
free
in
calling
a
spade
a
spade
that
our
dorothea
having
annexed
the
book
years
ago
on
the
strength
of
her
name
and
dipped
within
had
closed
it
in
sudden
virgin
terror
and
thrust
it
away
at
the
back
of
her
wardrobe
there
it
had
lain
until
disinterred
in
the
hurried
search
for
linen
for
raoul
wound
next
morning
dorothea
was
on
the
point
of
hiding
it
again
when
as
she
opened
the
covers
idly
her
eyes
fell
on
these
lines
but
at
my
back
i
alwaies
hear
time
winged
chariot
hurrying
near
and
yonder
all
before
me
lie
desarts
of
vast
eternitie
she
read
on
the
poem
after
all
turned
out
to
be
but
a
lover
appeal
to
his
mistress
to
give
over
coyness
and
use
time
while
she
might
but
dorothea
wondered
why
its
solemn
language
should
have
hit
her
namesake
fancy
and
turning
a
few
more
pages
discovered
that
this
merry
dead
girl
had
chosen
and
copied
out
other
verses
which
were
more
than
solemn
how
had
she
dug
these
gloomy
gems
out
of
donne
ford
webster
and
set
them
here
among
loose
songs
and
loose
epigrams
from
and
the
like
for
gems
they
were
though
dorothea
did
not
know
it
nor
whence
they
came
dorothea
had
small
sense
of
poetry
it
was
the
personal
interest
which
led
her
on
to
be
sure
the
little
animal
she
had
already
begun
to
construct
a
picture
of
her
might
have
secreted
these
things
for
no
more
reason
than
their
beauty
as
a
squirrel
will
pick
up
a
ruby
ring
and
hide
it
among
his
nuts
but
why
were
they
all
so
darkly
terrible
had
she
being
young
been
afraid
to
die
rather
it
seemed
as
if
now
and
then
in
the
midst
of
her
mirth
she
had
paused
and
been
afraid
to
live
and
in
the
end
she
had
married
a
devonshire
squire
which
on
the
face
of
it
is
no
darkly
romantic
thing
to
do
but
it
was
over
the
maiden
that
our
dorothea
pondered
until
by
and
by
the
small
shade
took
features
and
a
place
in
her
leisure
time
a
very
companionable
shade
though
tantalising
and
innocent
though
given
to
mischievously
sportive
hints
dorothea
sometimes
wondered
what
her
own
fate
would
have
been
with
this
naughtiness
in
her
young
blood
and
this
seriousness
it
was
sentiment
of
course
but
it
is
also
a
fact
that
this
ghost
of
a
kinswoman
brought
help
to
her
for
such
a
hurt
as
hers
the
specific
is
to
get
away
from
self
and
look
into
such
human
thought
as
is
kindly
yet
judicial
some
find
this
help
in
philosophy
many
more
in
wise
dorothea
had
no
philosophy
and
no
human
being
to
consult
for
admirably
as
endymion
had
behaved
he
remained
a
person
with
obvious
limits
the
general
held
aloof
she
had
no
reason
to
fear
that
he
suspected
her
secret
and
so
casting
about
for
a
cure
found
and
brought
her
this
companion
of
her
own
sex
from
between
the
covers
of
a
book
i
set
down
the
fact
merely
and
its
share
in
dorothea
recovery
chapter
xii
general
rochambeau
tells
a
story
and
the
rings
for
the
last
time
more
than
a
year
had
passed
when
one
february
morning
as
he
left
the
breakfast
table
endymion
handed
dorothea
a
slip
of
paper
do
you
think
we
can
entertain
at
dinner
next
wednesday
if
you
can
manage
it
i
wish
these
invitations
written
out
and
despatched
before
noon
next
wednesday
dorothea
eyebrows
went
up
invitations
to
dine
at
bayfield
had
always
as
we
know
been
issued
just
three
weeks
ahead
if
it
will
not
inconvenience
you
he
answered
and
his
manner
added
as
plainly
as
words
i
beg
that
you
will
not
press
for
my
reasons
he
was
booted
already
for
his
ride
into
axcester
dorothea
ran
her
eye
down
the
list
the
vicomte
de
tocqueville
general
all
the
prisoners
of
distinction
were
included
as
well
as
the
chief
notables
of
the
neighbourhood
which
made
it
a
long
one
even
without
a
full
balance
of
ladies
she
went
off
to
her
room
at
once
and
penned
the
letters
in
all
naturally
this
break
in
the
bayfield
custom
set
speculation
going
among
the
invited
but
it
is
doubtful
if
narcissus
any
more
than
dorothea
knew
the
reason
of
it
and
on
wednesday
when
the
guests
assembled
the
only
one
who
might
be
suspected
of
sharing
secret
was
oddly
enough
general
rochambeau
the
old
fellow
seemed
ten
years
younger
and
wore
an
air
of
sportiveness
almost
of
raillery
as
he
caught
his
host
eye
the
compliments
he
paid
lady
bateson
across
the
table
were
prodigious
and
gave
that
good
soul
a
hazy
sensation
of
being
wafted
back
to
the
court
of
louis
xv
and
behaving
brilliantly
under
the
circumstances
really
my
dear
westcote
she
protested
at
length
being
a
chartered
utterer
of
indiscretions
which
as
she
delighted
to
prove
endymion
would
not
tolerate
in
others
but
took
from
her
and
allowed
with
a
magisterial
smile
to
pass
really
i
trust
you
have
not
taken
off
the
general
parole
or
i
shall
have
to
lock
my
gates
for
fear
of
a
ah
the
general
echoed
turning
to
endymion
with
a
twinkle
of
malice
in
his
eye
but
when
westcote
releases
us
it
will
be
en
masse
and
then
believe
me
i
shall
come
with
an
army
since
i
underrate
neither
the
strength
of
the
fortress
nor
the
feeling
of
the
country
that
reminds
me
put
in
a
saxby
of
yeovil
or
near
by
we
have
heard
of
no
escape
or
attempts
at
escape
from
axcester
this
winter
i
congratulate
you
westcote
if
the
general
will
not
think
it
offensive
reassure
yourself
my
dear
sir
general
rochambeau
bowed
no
he
continued
lifting
his
eyes
for
a
moment
towards
dorothea
in
one
way
or
another
we
are
rid
of
our
and
the
rest
must
share
the
credit
with
our
commissary
and
yet
the
temptation
began
lady
bateson
is
great
madame
for
some
temperaments
but
the
vicomte
here
and
i
have
tried
to
teach
our
poor
compatriots
that
in
resisting
it
they
fight
for
france
as
surely
as
if
they
stormed
a
breach
and
by
the
way
i
heard
a
story
this
morning
if
the
company
would
care
to
hear
they
begged
him
to
tell
it
but
not
if
the
ladies
leave
us
to
our
wine
he
turned
to
dorothea
if
miss
westcote
will
rally
and
stay
her
forces
good
for
though
it
came
to
me
casually
in
a
letter
it
is
a
tale
of
the
sort
which
used
to
be
fashionable
in
my
youth
ah
long
before
le
tocqueville
remembers
and
for
the
telling
it
demanded
an
audience
of
ladies
which
must
help
me
who
am
rusty
to
recapture
the
style
if
i
can
he
pushed
back
his
chair
and
crossing
his
legs
leaned
forward
and
pushed
his
fingers
across
the
polished
mahogany
till
they
touched
the
base
of
a
beside
his
plate
one
or
two
of
the
guests
smiled
at
this
formal
opening
the
vicomte
eyes
showed
something
of
amusement
behind
their
apathy
but
all
listened
my
tale
miss
dorothea
is
of
a
certain
benest
who
until
a
few
weeks
ago
was
a
prisoner
on
parole
in
one
of
your
towns
on
the
south
coast
he
had
been
de
which
as
you
know
is
chief
petty
officer
of
the
frigate
captured
by
sir
john
warren
in
the
action
which
lost
her
benest
lost
a
leg
and
was
placed
in
an
english
hospital
where
they
gave
him
a
wooden
one
now
how
it
came
about
that
on
his
discharge
he
was
allowed
to
live
in
a
town
call
it
a
village
rather
a
haven
at
any
rate
where
for
a
couple
of
napoleons
he
might
have
found
a
boat
any
night
of
the
week
to
smuggle
him
over
to
roscoff
is
more
than
i
can
tell
you
it
may
be
that
he
had
once
borne
another
name
than
benest
one
to
command
privileges
since
many
of
my
countrymen
as
you
know
have
found
it
prudent
in
recent
years
to
change
their
names
and
take
up
with
callings
below
their
real
rank
there
at
any
rate
he
was
and
on
the
day
after
his
arrival
he
and
the
rector
of
the
parish
who
was
also
a
magistrate
took
a
walk
and
marked
out
the
bounds
together
two
miles
along
the
coast
to
the
east
two
miles
along
the
coast
to
the
west
and
two
miles
up
the
valley
behind
the
town
at
the
end
of
these
two
miles
the
valley
itself
branched
into
two
and
climbed
inland
the
road
branching
likewise
and
benest
mark
was
the
signpost
at
the
angle
well
at
first
he
walked
little
because
of
his
wooden
leg
he
had
lodgings
with
a
widow
in
a
cottage
overlooking
the
and
seemed
happy
enough
there
tending
a
monster
geranium
which
grew
against
the
or
pottering
about
the
quay
and
making
friends
with
the
children
for
the
children
soon
picked
up
an
affection
for
him
seeing
that
he
was
never
too
busy
to
drop
his
gardening
and
come
and
be
umpire
at
their
games
of
or
bars
also
he
had
stories
for
them
and
halfpennies
or
sweetmeats
in
mysterious
pockets
and
songs
which
he
taught
them
and
de
la
and

do
you
know
it
les
bateaux
qui
vont
sur
des
jambes
mais
oui
petit
beta
avaient
pas
ils
n
pas
in
short
benest
with
his
loose
blue
coat
and
naval
cap
endeared
himself
to
the
children
and
through
the
children
to
everyone
it
was
some
time
before
he
began
to
take
walks
and
i
believe
he
had
been
living
in
the
town
for
six
months
when
one
day
having
stumped
up
the
valley
road
for
a
change
and
just
as
he
was
facing
about
for
the
return
journey
he
heard
a
voice
in
his
own
language
singing
to
the
air
of
henri
the
voice
was
shaky
and
i
dare
say
uncertain
in
its
upper
notes
but
it
fetched
benest
again
he
perceived
that
it
came
from
the
garden
of
a
solitary
cottage
up
the
road
a
gunshot
and
more
beyond
his
signpost
but
a
tall
hedge
interrupted
his
view
and
though
he
stared
long
and
earnestly
all
he
could
see
that
day
was
a
nodding
above
it
he
came
again
however
not
the
next
day
but
the
day
after
and
was
rewarded
by
a
glimpse
of
a
white
cap
with
bows
which
seemed
at
that
distance
of
a
purplish
colour
its
wearer
was
standing
in
the
gateway
and
exchanging
a
word
with
the
rector
who
had
reined
up
his
horse
in
the
road
benest
walked
home
and
made
inquiries
but
his
landlady
could
only
tell
him
that
the
cottage
was
rented
by
two
ladies
sisters
she
had
heard
that
they
came
from
the
west
indies
who
saw
nobody
but
wished
only
to
be
let
alone
one
of
them
who
suffered
from
an
incurable
complaint
was
never
seen
the
other
could
be
seen
on
fine
days
in
her
garden
where
she
worked
vigorously
and
what
the
pair
lived
on
was
a
mystery
for
they
bought
nothing
in
the
town
or
of
their
neighbours
on
learning
this
benest
became
very
cunning
indeed
he
bought
a
fishing
rod
for
i
ought
to
have
told
you
that
a
stream
ran
down
the
valley
beside
the
road
and
it
contained
trout
perhaps
as
many
as
a
dozen
benest
had
no
desire
to
catch
them
but
you
see
he
was
forced
to
acquire
some
show
of
expertness
in
order
to
deceive
the
wayfarers
who
paused
and
watched
him
and
in
time
i
am
told
the
fish
after
being
unhooked
once
or
twice
and
restored
apologetically
to
the
water
came
to
enjoy
disconcerting
him
you
must
understand
that
he
had
no
foolish
illusions
concerning
the
white
cap
and
purplish
ribbons
the
mademoiselle
henriette
as
he
discovered
she
was
called
he
only
knew
that
here
were
two
women
his
compatriots
poor
certainly
often
hungry
perhaps
shipwrecked
so
close
to
him
upon
this
corner
of
pardon
me
miss
dorothea
an
unfriendly
land
yet
divided
from
any
comfort
he
could
bring
by
fifty
yards
of
road
and
his
word
of
honour
she
must
be
of
the
true
blood
of
france
who
quavered
out
henri
so
resolutely
over
her
digging
and
hoeing
but
the
sound
of
a
french
voice
might
hearten
her
as
hers
had
heartened
him
therefore
he
sang
lustily
while
he
angled
which
is
not
good
for
sport
and
when
he
caught
a
fish
broke
into
paeans
addressed
less
to
the
captive
with
which
between
you
and
me
he
was
secretly
annoyed
than
to
an
ear
unseen
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
but
there
came
a
day
how
shall
i
tell
it
when
calamity
fell
upon
the
cottage
for
some
time
the
farmers
up
the
valley
had
been
missing
sheep
what
so
easy
now
as
to
suspect
the
two
women
who
were
never
known
to
buy
either
bread
or
butcher
meat
you
can
guess
a
rabble
marched
up
from
the
town
and
broke
in
upon
them
it
found
nothing
of
course
and
i
am
told
that
at
sight
of
the
face
of
the
poor
elder
sister
it
fled
back
in
panic
leaving
the
place
a
wreck
it
so
happened
that
benest
had
pretermitted
his
angling
that
afternoon
for
a
stroll
along
the
cliff
but
he
heard
the
news
on
his
return
from
his
landlady
while
he
sat
at
tea
that
is
to
say
he
heard
a
part
of
it
for
before
the
story
was
out
he
had
set
down
his
teacup
caught
up
hat
and
stick
and
stumped
out
of
the
house
the
most
of
the
townspeople
were
indoors
at
tea
discussing
the
sensation
the
few
he
encountered
had
no
greeting
from
him
he
looked
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
had
no
ears
for
his
friends
the
trout
as
they
rose
at
the
evening
flies
he
reached
the
signpost
and
walked
past
it
he
stumped
straight
up
to
the
garden
gate
which
stood
ajar
and
pushed
it
wide
with
his
stick
there
were
signs
of
trampling
on
the
but
for
it
was
july
the
whole
garden
blazed
with
hollyhocks
oeillets
sweet
williams
sweet
peas
above
all
with
that
yellow
flower
mimulus
monkey
flower
is
it
not
which
grows
so
profusely
in
gardens
beside
streams
the
air
was
weighted
with
scent
of
the
réséda
and
of
the
jasmine
which
climbed
the
wall
and
almost
choked
the
roses
the
cottage
door
stood
ajar
also
he
thrust
this
open
too
and
for
the
first
time
stood
face
to
face
with
mademoiselle
henriette
she
sat
by
the
kitchen
table
with
one
arm
flung
across
it
and
her
body
bowed
with
grief
at
her
feet
lay
a
trodden
bunch
of
the
monkey
flowers
and
at
the
of
his
wooden
leg
on
the
threshold
she
sprang
up
and
faced
him
across
the
yellow
blossoms
he
began
have
just
learnt
but
it
is
an
infamy
i
am
french
i
also
though
you
do
not
know
me
perhaps
and
with
that
benest
stammered
and
came
to
a
halt
for
her
eyes
were
worse
than
woeful
they
were
accusing
yes
accusing
of
what
de
what
had
he
done
monsieur
an
officer
of
france
quel
rapport
y
monsieur
i
forgot
said
benest
half
to
himself
forgot
your
mais
ecoutez
donc
nous
savons
souffrir
nous
autres
franfaises
et
la
petite
qui
meurt
et
et
moi
qui
mourrai
presqu
a
mais
nous
nous
en
tenons
a
ne
pas
dishonorer
la
patrie
a
la
fin
ca
finira
bien
vous
en
mais
allez
she
stamped
her
foot
upon
the
flowers
and
benest
turned
and
fled
from
her
nay
in
his
haste
taking
a
towards
the
signpost
he
plunged
his
wooden
leg
deep
in
the
marsh
and
tumbled
helpless
overwhelmed
with
shame
he
never
passed
the
signpost
again
nor
caught
another
glimpse
of
mademoiselle
henriette
cap
three
days
later
the
rector
broke
into
the
cottage
and
discovered
her
seated
dead
and
stiff
her
hands
stained
with
digging
her
sister
grave
and
the
cottage
had
no
new
tenant
only
benest
continued
to
eye
it
wistfully
as
he
cast
his
flies
and
pondered
on
his
offence
which
she
had
died
without
forgiving
but
one
july
two
years
after
her
death
a
patch
of
gold
appeared
on
the
marsh
below
the
hedge
a
patch
of
the
some
seeds
had
been
blown
thither
or
carried
down
by
the
stream
next
july
the
patch
had
doubled
its
length
flowers
are
travelling
towards
me
said
benest
and
year
by
year
the
stream
brought
them
nearer
that
was
a
terrible
july
for
him
when
they
came
within
two
feet
of
the
signpost
but
he
would
not
stretch
a
hand
beyond
it
coquets
with
her
forgiveness
the
poor
mademoiselle
henriette
but
i
can
wait
pas
deshonorer
la
patrie
a
la
fin
before
the
next
july
he
had
made
sure
of
one
plant
at
least
on
his
side
of
the
signpost
and
fished
beside
it
day
after
day
fearful
lest
some
animal
should
browse
upon
it
but
when
the
happy
morning
came
for
it
to
open
and
benest
knelt
beside
his
prize
he
drew
back
a
hand
it
quite
open
he
asked
wait
since
all
is
safe
for
the
sun
to
warm
it
a
little
longer
and
he
waited
until
a
trout
to
remind
him
perhaps
took
a
fly
with
a
splash
beneath
his
nose
then
with
a
start
benest
fingers
closed
and
snapped
off
the
yellow
blossom
has
forgiven
me
said
he
now
i
can
forgive
myself
for
a
moment
or
two
though
his
story
was
ended
the
general
continued
to
toy
with
the
stem
of
his
wine
glass
one
or
two
of
the
guests
cried
bravo
but
lady
bateson
eyes
were
wet
and
dorothea
gazed
hard
for
a
while
into
the
polished
surface
of
the
mahogany
before
she
recalled
herself
and
with
a
nod
swept
the
ladies
away
to
the
later
in
a
pause
between
two
songs
the
general
dropped
into
a
seat
beside
her
can
you
guess
who
sent
me
that
story
he
asked
it
was
raoul
and
he
travelled
across
from
plymouth
in
the
ship
with
this
benest
who
happened
to
get
his
exchange
at
about
the
same
time
it
was
clever
of
him
to
worm
out
the
story
if
indeed
he
did
not
invent
it
but
that
young
man
has
genius
for
pathos
i
did
not
know
that
you
corresponded
indeed
nor
did
i
he
chose
to
write
i
may
answer
and
again
i
may
not
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
never
been
sure
if
we
condemned
him
quite
justly
dorothea
found
herself
able
to
look
straight
into
the
kindly
old
eyes
it
was
a
beautiful
story
did
you
tell
it
for
me
yes
mademoiselle
in
thanks
and
in
contrition
we
are
all
prisoners
in
this
world
but
while
it
is
certain
you
have
made
fortitude
easier
for
us
i
have
suspected
that
there
was
a
time
when
i
for
one
might
have
been
bolder
and
repaid
you
but
stood
aside
also
i
think
you
no
longer
require
help
no
longer
general
but
what
you
say
is
true
we
are
all
prisoners
here
or
sentries
at
the
best
and
dorothea
resting
her
fan
on
her
lap
let
these
lines
fall
from
her
not
consciously
quoting
but
musing
on
each
word
as
it
fell
brutus
and
cato
might
discharge
their
souls
and
give
them
furloughs
for
another
world
but
we
like
sentries
are
obliged
to
stand
in
starless
nights
and
wait
the
appointed
hour
the
general
stared
ah
mademoiselle
what
poet
taught
you
that
it
was
a
kinswoman
she
answered
and
caught
herself
blushing
i
do
not
know
the
author
the
secret
of
the
commissary
came
out
early
next
morning
when
the
call
came
for
the
prisoners
to
leave
axcester
and
whenever
dorothea
looked
back
on
this
epoch
in
her
life
what
she
found
most
wonderful
was
the
suddenness
of
its
end
as
day
broke
in
a
drizzle
and
before
she
was
well
awake
a
troop
of
dragoons
followed
by
a
company
of
the
regiment
of
foot
passed
the
bayfield
gates
on
the
way
to
axcester
the
troopers
entered
the
town
while
the
was
sounding
and
before
the
roll
could
be
called
the
prisoners
were
surrounded
their
release
had
come
and
though
many
had
sighed
for
it
for
years
it
found
them
quite
unprepared
their
release
had
come
but
first
they
must
be
marched
through
the
length
of
the
country
to
kelso
there
to
await
the
formalities
of
exchange
at
four
in
the
afternoon
the
infantry
marched
out
with
the
first
great
batch
early
next
morning
the
rest
owners
of
furniture
granted
a
few
hours
to
arrange
for
its
storage
or
sale
followed
their
comrades
there
was
no
cloud
of
dust
upon
the
road
for
dorothea
to
watch
they
departed
in
sheets
of
rain
and
under
the
dusk
of
dawn
she
never
again
saw
general
rochambeau
it
is
recorded
that
in
his
year
endymion
westcote
married
but
the
bride
was
not
lady
bateson
and
that
children
were
born
to
him
narcissus
lived
on
at
bayfield
and
compiled
at
his
leisure
a
of
which
mentions
the
decoration
of
the
orange
room
by
a
young
frenchman
of
talent
who
has
been
good
enough
to
assist
the
author
in
a
most
important
work
but
dorothea
preferred
her
independence
and
a
cottage
not
far
from
the
bridge
where
children
might
romp
as
they
listed
but
never
seemed
to
disturb
its
exquisite
order
