the
girl
of
the
snows
for
perhaps
the
first
time
in
his
life
howland
felt
the
spirit
of
romance
of
adventure
of
sympathy
for
the
picturesque
and
the
unknown
surging
through
his
veins
a
billion
stars
glowed
like
yellow
passionless
eyes
in
the
polar
cold
of
the
skies
behind
him
white
in
its
sinuous
twisting
through
the
wilderness
lay
the
icy
saskatchewan
with
a
few
scattered
lights
visible
where
prince
albert
the
last
outpost
of
civilization
came
down
to
the
river
half
a
mile
away
but
it
was
into
the
north
that
howland
looked
from
the
top
of
the
great
ridge
which
he
had
climbed
he
gazed
steadily
into
the
white
gloom
which
reached
for
a
thousand
miles
from
where
he
stood
to
the
arctic
sea
faintly
in
the
grim
silence
of
the
winter
night
there
came
to
his
ears
the
soft
hissing
sound
of
the
aurora
borealis
as
it
played
in
its
song
over
the
dome
of
the
earth
and
as
he
watched
the
cold
flashes
shooting
like
pale
arrows
through
the
distant
sky
and
listened
to
its
whispering
music
of
unending
loneliness
and
mystery
there
came
on
him
a
strange
feeling
that
it
was
beckoning
to
him
and
calling
to
him
telling
him
that
up
there
very
near
to
the
end
of
the
earth
lay
all
that
he
had
dreamed
of
and
hoped
for
since
he
had
grown
old
enough
to
begin
the
shaping
of
a
destiny
of
his
own
he
shivered
as
the
cold
nipped
at
his
blood
and
lighted
a
fresh
cigar
to
shield
himself
from
a
wind
that
was
growing
out
of
the
east
as
the
match
flared
in
the
cup
of
his
hands
for
an
instant
there
came
from
the
black
gloom
of
the
balsam
and
spruce
at
his
feet
a
wailing
hungerful
cry
that
brought
a
startled
breath
from
his
lips
it
was
a
cry
such
as
indian
dogs
make
about
the
tepees
of
masters
who
are
newly
dead
he
had
never
heard
such
a
cry
before
and
yet
he
knew
that
it
was
a
wolf
it
impressed
him
with
an
awe
which
was
new
to
him
and
he
stood
as
motionless
as
the
trees
about
him
until
from
out
the
gray
to
the
west
there
came
an
answering
cry
and
then
from
far
to
the
north
still
another
sounds
as
though
i
better
go
back
to
town
he
said
to
himself
speaking
aloud
by
george
but
it
lonely
he
descended
the
ridge
walked
rapidly
over
the
hard
crust
of
the
snow
across
the
saskatchewan
and
assured
himself
that
he
felt
considerably
easier
when
the
lights
of
prince
albert
gleamed
a
few
hundred
yards
ahead
of
him
jack
howland
was
a
chicago
man
which
means
that
he
was
a
hustler
and
not
overburdened
with
sentiment
for
fifteen
of
his
years
he
had
been
hustling
since
he
could
easily
remember
he
had
possessed
to
a
large
measure
but
one
ambition
and
one
hope
with
a
persistence
which
had
left
him
peculiarly
a
stranger
to
the
more
frivolous
and
human
sides
of
life
he
had
worked
toward
the
achievement
of
this
ambition
and
because
that
achievement
was
very
near
at
hand
he
was
happy
he
had
never
been
happier
there
flashed
across
his
mental
vision
a
swiftly
moving
picture
of
the
fight
he
had
made
for
success
it
had
been
a
magnificent
fight
without
vanity
he
was
proud
of
it
for
fate
had
handicapped
him
at
the
beginning
and
still
he
had
won
out
he
saw
himself
again
the
homeless
little
farmer
boy
setting
out
from
his
illinois
village
to
take
up
life
in
a
great
city
as
though
it
had
all
happened
but
yesterday
he
remembered
how
for
days
and
weeks
he
had
nearly
starved
how
he
had
sold
papers
at
first
and
then
by
lucky
chance
became
errand
boy
in
a
big
drafting
establishment
it
was
there
that
the
ambition
was
born
in
him
he
saw
great
engineers
come
and
go
men
who
were
greater
than
presidents
to
him
and
who
sought
out
the
ends
of
the
earth
in
the
following
of
their
vocation
he
made
a
slave
of
himself
in
the
nurturing
and
strengthening
of
his
ambition
to
become
one
of
them
to
be
a
builder
of
railroads
and
bridges
a
tunneler
of
mountains
a
creator
of
new
things
in
new
lands
his
slavery
had
not
lessened
as
his
years
increased
voluntarily
he
had
kept
himself
in
bondage
fighting
ceaselessly
the
obstacles
in
his
way
triumphing
over
his
handicaps
as
few
other
men
had
triumphed
rising
slowly
steadily
resistlessly
until
now
he
flung
back
his
head
and
the
pulse
of
his
heart
quickened
as
he
heard
again
the
words
of
van
horn
president
of
the
greatest
engineering
company
on
the
continent
howland
we
decided
to
put
you
in
charge
of
the
building
of
the
hudson
bay
railroad
it
one
of
the
wildest
jobs
we
ever
had
and
gregson
and
thorne
do
seem
to
catch
on
they
bridge
builders
and
not
wilderness
men
we
got
to
lay
a
single
line
of
steel
through
three
hundred
miles
of
the
wildest
country
in
north
america
and
from
this
hour
your
motto
is
it
or
bust
you
can
report
at
le
pas
as
soon
as
you
get
your
traps
together
those
words
had
broken
the
slavedom
for
howland
he
had
been
fighting
for
an
opportunity
and
now
that
the
opportunity
had
come
he
was
sure
that
he
would
succeed
swiftly
with
his
hands
thrust
deep
in
his
pockets
he
walked
down
the
one
main
street
of
prince
albert
puffing
out
odorous
clouds
of
smoke
from
his
cigar
every
fiber
in
him
tingling
with
the
new
joy
that
had
come
into
his
life
another
night
would
see
him
in
le
pas
the
little
outpost
sixty
miles
farther
east
on
the
saskatchewan
then
a
hundred
miles
by
and
he
would
be
in
the
big
wilderness
camp
where
three
hundred
men
were
already
at
work
clearing
a
way
to
the
great
bay
to
the
north
what
a
glorious
achievement
that
road
would
be
it
would
remain
for
all
time
as
a
cenotaph
to
his
ability
his
courage
and
indomitable
persistence
it
was
past
nine
when
howland
entered
the
little
old
windsor
hotel
the
big
room
through
the
windows
of
which
he
could
look
out
on
the
street
and
across
the
frozen
saskatchewan
was
almost
empty
the
clerk
had
locked
his
and
had
gone
to
bed
in
one
corner
partly
shrouded
in
gloom
sat
a
trapper
who
had
come
in
that
day
from
the
lac
la
ronge
country
and
at
his
feet
crouched
one
of
his
wolfish
both
were
and
stared
curiously
at
howland
as
he
came
in
in
front
of
the
two
large
windows
sat
half
a
dozen
men
as
silent
as
the
clad
in
moccasins
and
thick
caribou
skin
coats
one
of
them
was
the
factor
from
a
hudson
bay
post
at
lac
bain
who
had
not
been
down
to
the
edge
of
civilization
for
three
years
the
others
including
two
crees
and
a
chippewayan
were
hunters
and
post
men
who
had
driven
in
their
furs
from
a
hundred
miles
to
the
north
for
a
moment
howland
paused
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
looked
about
him
ordinarily
he
would
have
liked
this
quiet
and
would
have
gone
to
one
of
the
two
rude
tables
to
write
a
letter
or
work
out
a
problem
of
some
sort
for
he
always
carried
a
pocketful
of
problems
about
with
him
his
fifteen
years
of
study
and
unceasing
slavery
to
his
ambition
had
made
him
naturally
as
taciturn
as
these
grim
men
of
the
north
who
were
born
to
silence
but
there
had
come
a
change
over
him
he
wanted
to
talk
he
wanted
to
ask
questions
he
longed
for
human
companionship
for
some
kind
of
mental
exhilaration
beyond
that
furnished
by
his
own
thoughts
feeling
in
his
pocket
for
a
cigar
he
seated
himself
before
one
of
the
windows
and
proffered
it
to
the
factor
from
lac
bain
you
smoke
he
asked
companionably
i
was
born
in
a
wigwam
said
the
factor
slowly
taking
the
cigar
thank
you
deuced
polite
for
a
man
who
has
seen
civilization
for
three
years
thought
howland
seating
himself
comfortably
with
his
feet
on
the
aloud
he
said
the
clerk
tells
me
you
are
from
lac
bain
that
a
good
distance
north
is
it
four
hundred
miles
replied
the
factor
with
quiet
terseness
we
on
the
edge
of
the
barren
lands
whew
howland
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
he
volunteered
i
going
north
myself
post
man
no
engineer
i
putting
through
the
hudson
bay
railroad
he
spoke
the
words
quite
clearly
and
as
they
fell
from
his
lips
the
partly
concealed
in
the
gloom
behind
him
straightened
with
the
alert
quickness
of
a
cat
he
leaned
forward
eagerly
his
black
eyes
gleaming
and
then
rose
softly
from
his
seat
his
moccasined
feet
made
no
sound
as
he
came
up
behind
howland
it
was
the
big
huskie
who
first
gave
a
sign
of
his
presence
for
a
moment
the
upturned
eyes
of
the
young
engineer
met
those
of
the
that
look
gave
howland
a
glimpse
of
a
face
which
he
could
never
forget
a
thin
dark
sensitive
face
framed
in
shining
hair
and
a
pair
of
eyes
that
were
the
most
beautiful
he
had
ever
seen
in
a
man
sometimes
a
look
decides
great
friendship
or
bitter
hatred
between
men
and
something
nameless
unaccountable
passed
between
these
two
not
until
the
had
turned
and
was
walking
swiftly
away
did
howland
realize
that
he
wanted
to
speak
to
him
to
grip
him
by
the
hand
to
know
him
by
name
he
watched
the
slender
form
of
the
northerner
as
lithe
and
as
graceful
in
its
movement
as
a
wild
thing
of
the
forests
until
it
passed
from
the
door
out
into
the
night
who
was
that
he
asked
turning
to
the
factor
his
name
is
croisset
he
comes
from
the
wholdaia
country
beyond
lac
la
ronge
french
half
french
half
cree
the
factor
resumed
his
steady
gaze
out
into
the
white
distance
of
the
night
and
howland
gave
up
his
effort
at
conversation
after
a
little
his
companion
shoved
back
his
chair
and
bade
him
good
night
the
crees
and
chippewayan
followed
him
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
two
white
hunters
left
the
engineer
alone
before
the
windows
mighty
funny
people
he
said
half
aloud
wonder
if
they
ever
talk
he
leaned
forward
elbows
on
knees
his
face
resting
in
his
hands
and
stared
to
catch
a
sign
of
moving
life
outside
in
him
there
was
no
desire
for
sleep
often
he
had
called
himself
a
but
seldom
had
he
been
more
wakeful
than
on
this
night
the
elation
of
his
triumph
of
his
success
had
not
yet
worn
itself
down
to
a
normal
and
reasoning
satisfaction
and
his
chief
longing
was
for
the
day
and
the
day
after
that
and
the
next
day
when
he
would
take
the
place
of
gregson
and
thorne
every
muscle
in
his
body
was
vibrant
in
its
desire
for
action
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
only
ten
since
supper
he
had
smoked
almost
ceaselessly
now
he
lighted
another
cigar
and
stood
up
close
to
one
of
the
windows
faintly
he
caught
the
sound
of
a
step
on
the
board
walk
outside
it
was
a
light
quick
step
and
for
an
instant
it
hesitated
just
out
of
his
vision
then
it
approached
and
suddenly
the
figure
of
a
woman
stopped
in
front
of
the
window
how
she
was
dressed
howland
could
not
have
told
a
moment
later
all
that
he
saw
was
the
face
white
in
the
white
night
a
face
on
which
the
shimmering
starlight
fell
as
it
was
lifted
to
his
gaze
beautiful
as
as
a
cameo
with
eyes
that
looked
up
at
him
and
lips
parted
as
if
about
to
speak
to
him
he
stared
moveless
in
his
astonishment
and
in
another
breath
the
face
was
gone
with
a
hurried
exclamation
he
ran
across
the
empty
room
to
the
door
and
looked
down
the
starlit
street
to
go
from
the
window
to
the
door
took
him
but
a
few
seconds
yet
he
found
the
street
deserted
deserted
except
for
a
solitary
figure
three
blocks
away
and
a
dog
that
growled
at
him
as
he
thrust
out
his
head
and
shoulders
he
heard
no
sound
of
footsteps
no
opening
or
closing
of
a
door
only
there
came
to
him
that
faint
hissing
music
of
the
northern
skies
and
once
more
from
the
black
forest
beyond
the
saskatchewan
the
infinite
sadness
of
the
chapter
ii
lips
that
speak
not
howland
was
not
a
man
easily
susceptible
to
a
pair
of
eyes
and
a
pretty
face
the
practical
side
of
his
nature
was
too
much
absorbed
in
its
devices
and
schemes
for
the
building
of
material
things
to
allow
the
breaking
in
of
romance
at
least
howland
had
always
complimented
himself
on
this
fact
and
he
laughed
a
little
nervously
as
he
went
back
to
his
seat
near
the
window
he
was
conscious
that
a
flush
of
unusual
excitement
had
leaped
into
his
cheeks
and
already
the
practical
side
of
him
was
ashamed
of
that
to
which
the
romantic
side
had
surrendered
the
deuce
but
she
was
pretty
he
excused
himself
and
those
eyes
suddenly
he
checked
himself
there
had
been
more
than
the
eyes
more
than
the
pretty
face
why
had
the
girl
paused
in
front
of
the
window
why
had
she
looked
at
him
so
intently
as
though
on
the
point
of
speech
the
smile
and
the
flush
left
his
face
as
these
questions
came
to
him
and
he
wondered
if
he
had
failed
to
comprehend
something
which
she
had
meant
him
to
understand
after
all
might
it
not
have
been
a
case
of
mistaken
identity
for
a
moment
she
had
believed
that
she
recognized
him
then
seeing
her
mistake
had
passed
swiftly
down
the
street
under
ordinary
circumstances
howland
would
have
accepted
this
solution
of
the
incident
but
he
was
in
an
unusual
mood
and
it
quickly
occurred
to
him
that
even
if
his
supposition
were
true
it
did
not
explain
the
pallor
in
the
girl
face
and
the
strange
entreaty
which
had
glowed
for
an
instant
in
her
eyes
anyway
it
was
none
of
his
business
and
he
walked
casually
to
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
street
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
a
red
light
burned
feebly
over
the
front
of
a
chinese
restaurant
and
in
a
mechanical
fashion
his
footsteps
led
him
in
that
direction
i
drop
in
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
he
assured
himself
throwing
away
the
stub
of
his
cigar
and
filling
his
lungs
with
great
breaths
of
the
cold
dry
air
lord
but
it
a
glorious
night
i
wish
van
horn
could
see
it
he
stopped
and
turned
his
eyes
again
into
the
north
its
myriad
stars
white
and
unshivering
the
elusive
play
of
the
mysterious
lights
hovering
over
the
pole
and
the
black
edge
of
the
wilderness
beyond
the
river
were
holding
a
greater
and
greater
fascination
for
him
since
morning
when
he
had
looked
on
that
wilderness
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
new
blood
had
entered
into
him
and
he
rejoiced
that
it
was
this
wonderful
world
which
was
to
hold
for
him
success
and
fortune
never
had
he
dreamed
that
the
mere
joy
of
living
would
appeal
to
him
as
it
did
now
that
the
act
of
breathing
of
seeing
of
looking
on
wonders
in
which
his
hands
had
taken
no
part
in
the
making
would
fill
him
with
the
indefinable
pleasure
which
had
suddenly
become
his
experience
he
wondered
as
he
still
stood
gazing
into
the
infinity
of
that
other
world
beyond
the
saskatchewan
if
romance
was
really
quite
dead
in
him
always
he
had
laughed
at
romance
work
the
grim
reality
of
action
of
brain
fighting
brain
of
cleverness
pitted
against
other
cleverness
had
almost
brought
him
to
the
point
of
regarding
romance
in
life
as
a
peculiar
illusion
of
fools
and
women
but
he
was
fair
in
his
concessions
and
he
acknowledged
that
he
had
enjoyed
the
romance
of
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
and
most
of
all
his
blood
had
been
stirred
by
the
beautiful
face
that
had
looked
at
him
from
out
of
the
night
the
tuneless
thrumming
of
a
piano
sounded
behind
him
as
he
passed
through
the
low
door
of
the
restaurant
a
man
and
woman
lurched
past
him
and
in
their
irresolute
faces
and
leering
stare
he
read
the
verification
of
his
suspicions
of
the
place
through
a
second
door
he
entered
a
large
room
filled
with
tables
and
chairs
and
pregnant
with
strange
odors
at
one
of
the
farther
tables
sat
a
chinaman
with
his
head
bowed
in
his
arms
behind
a
counter
stood
a
second
as
motionless
as
an
obelisk
in
the
half
gloom
of
the
dimly
illuminated
room
his
evil
face
challenging
howland
as
he
entered
the
sound
of
a
piano
came
from
above
and
with
a
bold
and
friendly
nod
the
young
engineer
mounted
a
pair
of
stairs
tough
joint
he
muttered
falling
into
his
old
habit
of
communing
with
himself
hope
they
make
good
tea
at
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
on
the
stair
the
playing
of
the
piano
ceased
he
was
surprised
at
what
greeted
him
above
in
startling
contrast
to
the
loathsome
environment
below
he
entered
a
luxuriously
appointed
room
heavily
hung
with
oriental
tapestries
and
with
half
a
dozen
onyx
tables
partially
concealed
behind
screens
and
gorgeously
embroidered
silk
curtains
at
one
of
these
he
seated
himself
and
signaled
for
service
with
the
tiny
bell
near
his
hand
in
response
there
appeared
a
young
chinaman
with
hair
and
attired
in
evening
dress
a
pot
of
tea
ordered
howland
and
under
his
breath
he
added
pretty
deuced
good
for
a
wilderness
town
i
wonder
he
looked
about
him
curiously
although
it
was
only
eleven
the
place
appeared
to
be
empty
yet
howland
was
reasonably
assured
that
it
was
not
empty
he
was
conscious
of
sensing
in
a
vague
sort
of
way
the
presence
of
others
somewhere
near
him
he
was
sure
that
there
was
a
faint
acrid
odor
lurking
above
that
of
burned
incense
and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
conviction
when
he
paid
a
dollar
for
his
pot
of
tea
opium
as
sure
as
your
name
is
jack
howland
he
said
when
the
waiter
was
gone
i
wonder
again
how
many
pots
of
tea
do
they
sell
in
a
night
he
sipped
his
own
leisurely
listening
with
all
the
eagerness
of
the
new
sense
of
freedom
which
had
taken
possession
of
him
the
chinaman
had
scarcely
disappeared
when
he
heard
footsteps
on
the
stair
in
another
instant
a
low
word
of
surprise
almost
leaped
from
his
lips
hesitating
for
a
moment
in
the
doorway
her
face
staring
straight
into
his
own
was
the
girl
whom
he
had
seen
through
the
hotel
window
for
perhaps
no
more
than
five
seconds
their
eyes
met
yet
in
that
time
there
was
painted
on
his
memory
a
picture
that
howland
knew
he
would
never
forget
his
was
a
nature
because
of
the
ambition
imposed
on
it
that
had
never
taken
more
than
a
casual
interest
in
the
form
and
feature
of
women
he
had
looked
on
beautiful
faces
and
had
admired
them
in
a
cool
dispassionate
way
judging
them
when
he
judged
at
all
as
he
might
have
judged
the
more
material
workmanship
of
his
own
hands
but
this
face
that
was
framed
for
a
few
brief
moments
in
the
door
reached
out
to
him
and
stirred
an
interest
within
him
which
was
as
new
as
it
was
pleasurable
it
was
a
beautiful
face
he
knew
that
in
a
fraction
of
the
first
second
it
was
not
white
as
he
had
first
seen
it
through
the
window
the
girl
cheeks
were
flushed
her
lips
were
parted
and
she
was
breathing
quickly
as
though
from
the
effect
of
climbing
the
stair
but
it
was
her
eyes
that
sent
howland
blood
a
little
faster
through
his
veins
they
were
glorious
eyes
the
girl
turned
from
his
gaze
and
seated
herself
at
a
table
so
that
he
caught
only
her
profile
the
change
delighted
him
it
afforded
him
another
view
of
the
picture
that
had
appeared
to
him
in
the
doorway
and
he
could
study
it
without
being
observed
in
the
act
though
he
was
confident
that
the
girl
knew
his
eyes
were
on
her
he
refilled
his
tiny
cup
with
tea
and
smiled
when
he
noticed
that
she
could
easily
have
seated
herself
behind
one
of
the
screens
from
the
flush
in
her
cheeks
his
eyes
traveled
critically
to
the
rich
glow
of
the
light
in
her
shining
brown
hair
which
swept
half
over
her
ears
in
thick
soft
waves
caught
in
a
heavy
coil
low
on
her
neck
then
for
the
first
time
he
noticed
her
dress
it
puzzled
him
her
turban
and
muff
were
of
deep
gray
lynx
fur
around
her
shoulders
was
a
collarette
of
the
same
material
her
hands
were
immaculately
gloved
in
every
feature
of
her
lovely
face
in
every
point
of
her
dress
she
bore
the
indisputable
mark
of
refinement
the
quizzical
smile
left
his
lips
the
thoughts
which
at
first
had
filled
his
mind
as
quickly
disappeared
who
was
she
why
was
she
here
with
quietness
the
young
chinaman
entered
between
the
screens
and
stood
beside
her
on
a
small
tablet
which
howland
had
not
before
observed
she
wrote
her
order
it
was
for
tea
he
noticed
that
she
gave
the
waiter
a
dollar
bill
in
payment
and
that
the
chinaman
returned
cents
to
her
in
change
discrimination
he
chuckled
to
himself
proof
that
she
not
a
stranger
here
and
knows
the
price
of
things
he
poured
his
last
half
cup
of
tea
and
when
he
lifted
his
eyes
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
girl
was
looking
at
him
for
a
brief
interval
her
gaze
was
steady
and
clear
then
the
flush
deepened
in
her
cheeks
her
long
lashes
drooped
as
the
cold
gray
of
howland
eyes
met
hers
in
unflinching
challenge
and
she
turned
to
her
tea
howland
noted
that
the
hand
which
lifted
the
little
japanese
pot
was
trembling
slightly
he
leaned
forward
and
as
if
impelled
by
the
movement
the
girl
turned
her
face
to
him
again
the
poised
above
her
cup
in
her
dark
eyes
was
an
expression
which
half
brought
him
to
his
feet
a
wistful
glow
a
pathetic
and
yet
appeal
to
him
he
rose
his
eyes
questioning
her
and
to
his
unspoken
inquiry
her
lips
formed
themselves
into
a
round
red
o
and
she
nodded
to
the
opposite
side
of
her
table
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
seating
himself
may
i
give
you
my
card
he
felt
as
if
there
was
something
brutally
indecent
in
what
he
was
doing
and
the
knowledge
of
it
sent
a
red
flush
to
his
cheeks
the
girl
read
his
name
smiled
across
the
table
at
him
and
with
a
pretty
gesture
motioned
him
to
bring
his
cup
and
share
her
tea
with
her
he
returned
to
his
table
and
when
he
came
back
with
the
cup
in
his
hand
she
was
writing
on
one
of
the
pages
of
the
tablet
which
she
passed
across
to
him
you
must
pardon
me
for
not
talking
he
read
i
can
hear
you
very
well
but
i
unfortunately
am
a
mute
he
could
not
repress
the
low
ejaculation
of
astonishment
that
came
to
his
lips
and
as
his
companion
lifted
her
cup
he
saw
in
her
face
again
the
look
that
had
stirred
him
so
strangely
when
he
stood
in
the
window
of
the
hotel
windsor
howland
was
not
a
man
educated
in
the
trivialities
of
chance
flirtations
he
lacked
finesse
and
now
he
spoke
boldly
and
to
the
point
the
honest
candor
of
his
gray
eyes
shining
full
on
the
girl
i
saw
you
from
the
hotel
window
he
began
and
something
in
your
face
led
me
to
believe
that
you
were
in
trouble
that
is
why
i
have
ventured
to
be
so
bold
i
am
the
engineer
in
charge
of
the
new
hudson
bay
railroad
just
on
my
way
to
le
pas
from
chicago
i
a
stranger
in
town
i
never
been
in
this
this
place
before
it
a
very
nice
an
admirable
blind
for
the
opium
stalls
behind
those
walls
in
a
few
terse
words
he
had
covered
the
situation
as
he
would
have
covered
a
similar
situation
in
a
business
deal
he
had
told
the
girl
who
and
what
he
was
had
revealed
the
cause
of
his
interest
in
her
and
at
the
same
time
had
given
her
to
understand
that
he
was
aware
of
the
nature
of
their
present
environment
closely
he
watched
the
effect
of
his
words
and
in
another
breath
was
sorry
that
he
had
been
so
blunt
the
girl
eyes
traveled
swiftly
about
her
he
saw
the
quick
rise
and
fall
of
her
bosom
the
swift
fading
of
the
color
in
her
cheeks
the
affrighted
glow
in
her
eyes
as
they
came
back
big
and
questioning
to
him
i
did
know
she
wrote
quickly
and
hesitated
her
face
was
as
white
now
as
when
howland
had
looked
on
it
through
the
window
her
hand
trembled
nervously
and
for
an
instant
her
lip
quivered
in
a
way
that
set
howland
heart
pounding
tumultuously
within
him
i
am
a
stranger
too
she
added
i
have
never
been
in
this
place
before
i
came
because
she
stopped
and
the
catching
breath
in
her
throat
was
almost
a
sob
as
she
looked
at
howland
he
knew
that
it
took
an
effort
for
her
to
write
the
next
words
i
came
because
you
came
why
he
asked
his
voice
was
low
and
assuring
tell
me
why
he
read
her
words
as
she
wrote
them
leaning
half
across
the
table
in
his
eagerness
i
am
a
stranger
she
repeated
i
want
some
one
to
help
me
accidentally
i
learned
who
you
were
and
made
up
my
mind
to
see
you
at
the
hotel
but
when
i
got
there
i
was
afraid
to
go
in
then
i
saw
you
in
the
window
after
a
little
you
came
out
and
i
saw
you
enter
here
i
did
know
what
kind
of
place
it
was
and
i
followed
you
wo
you
please
go
with
me
to
where
i
am
staying
and
i
will
tell
you
she
left
the
sentence
unfinished
her
eyes
pleading
with
him
without
a
word
he
rose
and
seized
his
hat
i
will
go
miss
he
laughed
frankly
into
her
face
inviting
her
to
write
her
name
for
a
moment
she
smiled
back
at
him
the
color
brightening
her
cheeks
then
she
turned
and
hurried
down
the
stair
outside
howland
gave
her
his
arm
his
eyes
passing
above
her
caught
again
the
luring
play
of
the
aurora
in
the
north
he
flung
back
his
shoulders
drank
in
the
fresh
air
and
laughed
in
the
buoyancy
of
the
new
life
that
he
felt
it
a
glorious
night
he
exclaimed
the
girl
nodded
and
smiled
up
at
him
her
face
was
very
near
to
his
shoulder
ever
more
beautiful
in
the
white
light
of
the
stars
they
did
not
look
behind
them
neither
heard
the
quiet
fall
of
moccasined
feet
a
dozen
yards
away
neither
saw
the
gleaming
eyes
and
the
thin
dark
face
of
jean
croisset
the
as
they
walked
swiftly
in
the
direction
of
the
saskatchewan
chapter
iii
the
mysterious
attack
howland
was
glad
that
for
a
time
there
was
an
excuse
for
his
silence
it
began
to
dawn
on
him
that
this
was
an
extraordinary
adventure
for
a
man
on
whose
shoulders
rested
the
responsibilities
of
one
of
the
greatest
engineering
tasks
on
the
continent
and
who
was
due
to
take
a
train
for
the
seat
of
his
operations
at
eight
in
the
morning
inwardly
he
was
experiencing
some
strange
emotions
outwardly
he
smiled
as
he
thought
of
what
van
horn
would
say
if
he
knew
the
circumstances
he
looked
down
at
his
companion
saw
the
sheen
of
her
hair
as
it
rippled
out
from
under
her
fur
turban
studied
the
soft
contour
of
her
cheek
and
chin
without
himself
being
observed
and
noticed
incidentally
that
the
top
of
the
bewitching
head
beside
him
came
just
about
to
a
level
with
his
cigar
which
he
was
smoking
he
wondered
if
he
were
making
a
fool
of
himself
if
so
he
assured
himself
that
there
was
at
least
one
compensation
this
night
in
prince
albert
would
not
be
so
uninteresting
as
it
had
promised
to
be
earlier
in
the
evening
where
the
river
ferry
was
half
drawn
up
on
the
shore
its
stern
frozen
in
the
ice
he
paused
and
looked
down
at
the
girl
in
quiet
surprise
she
nodded
smiling
and
motioned
across
the
river
i
was
over
there
once
said
howland
aloud
did
see
any
houses
and
heard
nothing
but
wolves
is
that
where
we
going
her
white
teeth
gleamed
at
him
and
he
was
conscious
of
a
warm
pressure
against
his
arm
as
the
girl
signified
that
they
were
to
cross
his
perplexity
increased
on
the
farther
shore
the
forest
came
down
to
the
river
edge
in
a
black
wall
of
spruce
and
balsam
beyond
that
edge
of
the
wilderness
he
knew
that
no
part
of
prince
albert
intruded
it
was
possible
that
across
from
them
was
a
squatter
cabin
and
yet
if
this
were
so
and
the
girl
was
going
to
it
why
had
she
told
him
that
she
was
a
stranger
in
the
town
and
why
had
she
come
to
him
for
the
assistance
she
promised
to
request
of
him
instead
of
seeking
it
of
those
whom
she
knew
he
asked
himself
these
questions
without
putting
them
in
words
and
not
until
they
were
climbing
up
the
frozen
bank
of
the
stream
with
the
shadows
of
the
forest
growing
deeper
about
them
did
he
speak
again
you
told
me
you
were
a
stranger
he
said
stopping
his
companion
where
the
light
of
the
stars
fell
on
the
face
which
she
turned
up
to
him
she
smiled
and
nodded
affirmatively
you
seem
pretty
well
acquainted
over
here
he
persisted
where
are
we
going
this
time
she
responded
with
an
emphatic
negative
shake
of
her
head
at
the
same
time
pointing
with
her
free
hand
to
the
trail
that
wound
up
from
the
ferry
landing
into
the
forest
earlier
in
the
day
howland
had
been
told
that
this
was
the
great
north
trail
that
led
into
the
vast
wildernesses
beyond
the
saskatchewan
two
days
before
the
factor
from
lac
bain
the
chippewayan
and
the
crees
had
come
in
over
it
its
hard
crust
bore
the
marks
of
the
sledges
of
jean
croisset
and
the
men
from
the
lac
la
ronge
country
since
the
big
snow
which
had
fallen
four
feet
deep
ten
days
before
a
forest
man
had
now
and
then
used
this
trail
on
his
way
down
to
the
edge
of
civilization
but
none
from
prince
albert
had
traveled
it
in
the
other
direction
howland
had
been
told
this
at
the
hotel
and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
candid
bewilderment
as
he
stared
down
into
the
girl
face
she
seemed
to
understand
his
thoughts
and
again
her
mouth
rounded
itself
into
that
bewitching
red
o
which
gave
to
her
face
an
expression
of
tender
entreaty
of
pathetic
grief
that
the
soft
lips
were
powerless
to
voice
the
words
which
she
wished
to
speak
then
suddenly
she
darted
a
few
steps
from
howland
and
with
the
toe
of
her
shoe
formed
a
single
word
in
the
surface
of
the
snow
she
rested
her
hand
lightly
on
howland
shoulder
as
he
bent
over
to
make
it
out
in
the
elusive
starlight
camp
he
cried
straightening
himself
do
you
mean
to
say
camping
out
here
she
nodded
again
and
again
delighted
that
he
understood
her
there
was
something
so
childishly
sweet
in
her
face
in
the
gladness
of
her
eyes
that
howland
stretched
out
both
his
hands
to
her
laughing
aloud
you
he
exclaimed
camping
out
here
with
a
quick
little
movement
she
came
to
him
still
laughing
with
her
eyes
and
lips
and
for
an
instant
he
held
both
her
hands
tight
in
his
own
her
lovely
face
was
dangerously
near
to
him
he
felt
the
touch
of
her
breath
on
his
face
for
an
instant
caught
the
sweet
scent
of
her
hair
never
had
he
seen
eyes
like
those
that
glowed
up
at
him
softly
filled
with
the
gentle
starlight
never
in
his
life
had
he
dreamed
of
a
face
like
this
so
near
to
him
that
it
sent
the
blood
leaping
through
his
veins
in
strange
excitement
he
held
the
hands
tighter
and
the
movement
drew
the
girl
closer
to
him
until
for
no
more
than
a
breath
he
felt
her
against
his
breast
in
that
moment
he
forgot
all
sense
of
time
and
place
forgot
his
old
self
jack
howland
practical
unromantic
of
railroads
forgot
everything
but
this
presence
of
the
girl
the
warm
pressure
against
his
breast
the
lure
of
the
great
brown
eyes
that
had
come
so
unexpectedly
into
his
life
in
another
moment
he
had
recovered
himself
he
drew
a
step
back
freeing
the
girl
hands
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
softly
his
cheeks
burned
hotly
at
what
he
had
done
and
turning
squarely
about
he
strode
up
the
trail
he
had
not
taken
a
dozen
paces
when
far
ahead
of
him
he
saw
the
red
glow
of
a
fire
then
a
hand
caught
his
arm
clutching
at
it
almost
fiercely
and
he
turned
to
meet
the
girl
face
white
now
with
a
strange
terror
what
is
it
he
cried
tell
me
he
caught
her
hands
again
startled
by
the
look
in
her
eyes
quickly
she
pulled
herself
away
a
dozen
feet
behind
her
in
the
thick
shadows
of
the
forest
trees
something
took
shape
and
movement
in
a
flash
howland
saw
a
huge
form
leap
from
the
gloom
and
caught
the
gleam
of
an
uplifted
knife
there
was
no
time
for
him
to
leap
aside
no
time
for
him
to
reach
for
the
revolver
which
he
carried
in
his
pocket
in
such
a
crisis
actions
are
involuntary
as
if
life
hovering
by
a
thread
preserves
itself
in
its
own
manner
and
without
thought
or
reasoning
on
the
part
of
the
creature
it
animates
for
an
instant
howland
neither
thought
nor
reasoned
had
he
done
so
he
would
probably
have
met
his
mysterious
assailant
pitting
his
naked
fists
against
the
knife
but
the
very
mainspring
of
his
existence
which
is
called
on
him
to
do
otherwise
before
the
startled
cry
on
his
lips
found
utterance
he
flung
himself
face
downward
in
the
snow
the
move
saved
him
and
as
the
other
stumbled
over
his
body
pitching
headlong
into
the
trail
he
snatched
forth
his
revolver
before
he
could
fire
there
came
a
roar
like
that
of
a
beast
from
behind
him
and
a
terrific
blow
fell
on
his
head
under
the
weight
of
a
second
assailant
he
was
crushed
to
the
snow
his
pistol
slipped
from
his
grasp
and
two
great
hands
choked
a
despairing
cry
from
his
throat
he
saw
a
face
over
him
distorted
with
passion
a
huge
neck
eyes
that
named
like
angry
garnets
he
struggled
to
free
his
pinioned
arms
to
wrench
off
the
at
his
throat
but
his
efforts
were
like
those
of
a
child
against
a
giant
in
a
last
terrible
attempt
he
drew
up
his
knees
inch
by
inch
under
the
weight
of
his
enemy
it
was
his
only
chance
his
only
hope
even
as
he
felt
the
fingers
about
his
throat
sinking
like
hot
iron
into
his
flesh
and
the
breath
slipping
from
his
body
he
remembered
this
murderous
taught
to
him
by
the
rough
fighters
of
the
inland
seas
and
with
all
the
life
that
remained
in
him
he
sent
it
crushing
into
the
other
abdomen
it
was
a
moment
before
he
knew
that
it
had
been
successful
before
the
film
cleared
from
his
eyes
and
he
saw
his
assailant
groveling
in
the
snow
he
rose
to
his
feet
dazed
and
staggering
from
the
effect
of
the
blow
on
his
head
and
the
murderous
grip
at
his
throat
half
a
pistol
shot
down
the
trail
he
saw
indistinctly
the
twisting
of
black
objects
in
the
snow
and
as
he
stared
one
of
the
objects
came
toward
him
do
not
fire
howland
he
heard
a
voice
call
it
ees
i
jean
croisset
a
friend
blessed
saints
that
was
what
you
call
heem
close
heem
close
call
the
thin
dark
face
came
up
smiling
out
of
the
white
gloom
for
a
moment
howland
did
not
see
him
scarcely
heard
his
words
wildly
he
looked
about
him
for
the
girl
she
was
gone
i
happened
here
just
in
time
with
a
club
continued
croisset
come
we
must
go
the
smile
had
gone
from
his
face
and
there
was
a
commanding
firmness
in
the
grip
that
fell
on
the
young
engineer
arm
howland
was
conscious
that
things
were
twisting
about
him
and
that
there
was
a
strange
weakness
in
his
limbs
dumbly
he
raised
his
hands
to
his
head
which
hurt
him
until
he
felt
as
if
he
must
cry
out
in
his
pain
the
girl
he
gasped
weakly
croisset
arm
tightened
about
his
waist
she
ees
gone
howland
heard
him
say
and
there
was
something
in
the
low
voice
that
caused
him
to
turn
unquestioningly
and
stagger
along
beside
him
in
the
direction
of
prince
albert
and
yet
as
he
went
only
of
what
he
was
doing
and
leaning
more
and
more
heavily
on
his
companion
he
knew
that
it
was
more
than
the
girl
disappearance
that
he
wanted
to
understand
for
as
the
blow
had
fallen
on
his
head
he
was
sure
that
he
had
heard
a
scream
and
as
he
lay
in
the
snow
dazed
and
choking
spending
his
last
effort
in
his
struggle
for
life
there
had
come
to
him
as
if
from
an
infinite
distance
a
woman
voice
and
the
words
that
it
had
uttered
pounded
in
his
tortured
brain
now
as
his
head
dropped
weakly
against
croisset
shoulder
you
are
killing
him
killing
him
he
tried
to
repeat
them
aloud
but
his
voice
sounded
only
in
an
incoherent
murmur
where
the
forest
came
down
to
the
edge
of
the
river
the
stopped
i
must
carry
you
howland
he
said
and
as
he
staggered
out
on
the
ice
with
his
inanimate
burden
he
spoke
softly
to
himself
the
saints
preserve
me
but
what
would
the
sweet
meleese
say
if
she
knew
that
jean
croisset
had
come
so
near
to
losing
the
life
of
this

chapter
iv
the
warning
in
only
a
subconscious
sort
of
way
was
howland
cognizant
of
anything
more
that
happened
that
night
when
he
came
back
into
a
full
sense
of
his
existence
he
found
himself
in
his
bed
at
the
hotel
a
lamp
was
burning
low
on
the
table
a
glance
showed
him
that
the
room
was
empty
he
raised
his
head
and
shoulders
from
the
pillows
on
which
they
were
resting
and
the
movement
helped
to
bring
him
at
once
into
a
realization
of
what
had
happened
he
was
hurt
there
was
a
dull
aching
pain
in
his
head
and
neck
and
when
he
raised
an
inquiring
hand
it
came
in
contact
with
a
thick
bandage
he
wondered
if
he
were
badly
hurt
and
sank
back
again
on
the
pillows
lying
with
his
eyes
staring
at
the
faint
glow
of
the
lamp
soon
there
came
a
sound
at
the
door
and
he
twisted
his
head
grimacing
with
the
pain
it
caused
him
jean
was
looking
in
at
him
ah
ees
awake
he
said
seeing
the
eyes
he
came
in
softly
closing
the
door
behind
him
but
if
it
had
been
a
heavier
club
by
the
weight
of
a
pound
you
would
have
gone
into
the
blessed
hereafter
he
smiled
approaching
with
noiseless
tread
he
held
a
glass
of
water
to
howland
lips
is
it
bad
croisset
so
bad
that
you
will
be
in
bed
for
a
day
or
so
that
is
all
impossible
cried
the
young
engineer
i
must
take
the
eight
train
in
the
morning
i
must
be
in
le
pas
it
is
five
now
interrupted
jean
softly
do
you
feel
like
going
howland
straightened
himself
and
fell
back
suddenly
with
a
sharp
cry
the
devil
he
exclaimed
after
a
moment
he
added
there
will
be
no
other
train
for
two
days
as
he
raised
a
hand
to
his
aching
head
his
other
closed
tightly
about
jean
lithe
brown
fingers
i
want
to
thank
you
for
what
you
did
croisset
i
do
know
what
happened
i
do
know
who
they
were
or
why
they
tried
to
kill
me
there
was
a
girl
i
was
going
with
her
he
dropped
his
hand
in
time
to
see
the
strange
fire
that
had
leaped
into
the
eyes
in
astonishment
he
half
lifted
himself
again
his
white
face
questioning
croisset
do
you
know
he
whispered
eagerly
who
was
she
why
did
she
lead
me
into
that
ambush
why
did
they
attempt
to
kill
me
the
questions
shot
from
him
excitedly
and
he
knew
from
what
he
saw
in
the
other
face
that
croisset
could
have
answered
them
yet
from
the
thin
tense
lips
above
him
there
came
no
response
with
a
quick
movement
the
drew
away
his
hand
and
moved
toward
the
door
half
way
he
paused
and
turned
i
have
come
to
you
with
a
warning
do
not
go
to
le
pas
do
not
go
to
the
big
railroad
camp
on
the
wekusko
return
into
the
south
for
an
instant
he
leaned
forward
his
black
eyes
flashing
his
hands
clenched
tightly
at
his
sides
perhaps
you
will
understand
he
cried
tensely
when
i
tell
you
this
warning
is
sent
to
you
by
the
little
meleese
before
howland
could
recover
from
his
surprise
croisset
had
passed
swiftly
through
the
door
the
engineer
called
his
name
but
there
came
no
response
other
than
the
rapidly
retreating
sound
of
the
moccasined
feet
with
a
grumble
of
vexation
he
sank
back
on
his
pillows
the
fresh
excitement
had
set
his
head
in
a
whirl
again
and
a
feverish
heat
mounted
into
his
face
for
a
long
time
he
lay
with
his
eyes
closed
trying
to
clear
for
himself
the
mystery
of
the
preceding
night
the
one
thought
which
obsessed
him
was
that
he
had
been
duped
his
lovely
acquaintance
of
the
preceding
evening
had
ensnared
him
completely
with
her
gentle
smile
and
her
winsome
mouth
and
he
gritted
his
teeth
grimly
as
he
reflected
how
easy
he
had
been
deliberately
she
had
lured
him
into
the
ambush
which
would
have
proved
fatal
for
him
had
it
not
been
for
jean
croisset
and
she
was
not
a
mute
he
had
heard
her
voice
when
that
was
tightest
about
his
throat
there
had
come
to
him
that
terrified
cry
you
are
killing
him
killing
him
his
breath
came
a
little
faster
as
he
whispered
the
words
to
himself
they
appealed
to
him
now
with
a
significance
which
he
had
not
understood
at
first
he
was
sure
that
in
that
cry
there
had
been
real
terror
almost
he
fancied
as
he
lay
with
his
eyes
shut
tight
that
he
could
still
hear
the
shrill
note
of
despair
in
the
voice
the
more
he
tried
to
reason
the
situation
the
more
inexplicable
grew
the
mystery
of
it
all
if
the
girl
had
calmly
led
him
into
the
ambush
why
in
the
last
moment
when
success
seemed
about
to
crown
her
duplicity
had
she
cried
out
in
that
agony
of
terror
in
howland
heated
brain
there
came
suddenly
a
vision
of
her
as
she
stood
beside
him
in
the
white
trail
he
felt
again
the
thrill
of
her
hands
the
touch
of
her
breast
for
a
moment
against
his
own
saw
the
gentle
look
that
had
come
into
her
deep
pure
eyes
the
pathetic
tremor
of
the
lips
which
seemed
bravely
striving
to
speak
to
him
was
it
possible
that
face
and
eyes
like
those
could
have
led
him
into
a
deathtrap
despite
the
evidence
of
what
had
happened
he
found
himself
filled
with
doubt
and
yet
after
all
she
had
lied
to
him
for
she
was
not
a
mute
he
turned
over
with
a
groan
and
watched
the
door
when
croisset
returned
he
would
insist
on
knowing
more
about
the
strange
occurrence
for
he
was
sure
that
the
could
clear
away
at
least
a
part
of
the
mystery
vainly
as
he
watched
and
waited
he
racked
his
mind
to
find
some
reason
for
the
murderous
attack
on
himself
who
was
the
little
meleese
whom
croisset
declared
had
sent
the
warning
so
far
as
he
could
remember
he
had
never
known
a
person
by
that
name
and
yet
the
had
uttered
it
as
though
it
would
carry
a
vital
meaning
to
him
perhaps
you
will
understand
he
had
said
and
howland
strove
to
understand
until
his
brain
grew
dizzy
and
a
nauseous
sickness
overcame
him
the
first
light
of
the
day
was
falling
faintly
through
the
window
when
footsteps
sounded
outside
the
door
again
it
was
not
croisset
who
appeared
this
time
but
the
proprietor
himself
bearing
with
him
a
tray
on
which
there
was
toast
and
a
steaming
pot
of
coffee
he
nodded
and
smiled
as
he
saw
howland
half
sitting
up
bad
fall
you
had
he
greeted
drawing
a
small
table
close
beside
the
bed
this
snow
is
treacherous
when
you
climbing
among
the
rocks
when
it
caves
in
with
you
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
you
might
as
well
make
up
your
mind
you
going
to
get
a
good
bump
good
thing
croisset
was
with
you
for
a
few
moments
howland
was
speechless
yes
it
was
a
bad
fall
he
replied
at
last
looking
sharply
at
the
other
where
is
croisset
gone
he
left
an
hour
ago
with
his
dogs
funny
fellow
that
croisset
came
in
yesterday
from
the
lac
la
ronge
country
a
hundred
miles
north
goes
back
no
apparent
reason
for
his
coming
none
for
his
going
that
i
can
see
do
you
know
anything
about
him
asked
howland
a
little
eagerly
no
he
comes
in
about
once
or
twice
a
year
the
young
engineer
munched
his
toast
and
drank
his
coffee
for
some
moments
in
silence
then
casually
he
asked
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
person
by
the
name
of
meleese
meleese
meleese
meleese
repeated
the
hotel
man
running
a
hand
through
his
hair
it
seems
to
me
that
the
name
is
familiar
and
yet
i
ca
remember
he
caught
himself
in
sudden
triumph
ah
i
have
it
two
years
ago
i
had
a
kitchen
woman
named
meleese
howland
shrugged
his
shoulders
this
was
a
young
woman
he
said
the
meleese
we
had
is
dead
replied
the
proprietor
cheerfully
rising
to
go
i
send
up
for
your
tray
in
half
an
hour
or
so
mr
howland
several
hours
later
howland
crawled
from
his
bed
and
bathed
his
head
in
cold
water
after
that
he
felt
better
dressed
himself
and
went
below
his
head
pained
him
considerably
but
beyond
that
and
an
occasional
nauseous
sensation
the
injury
he
had
received
in
the
fight
caused
him
no
very
great
distress
he
went
in
to
dinner
and
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
was
so
much
improved
that
he
lighted
his
first
cigar
and
ventured
out
into
the
bracing
air
for
a
short
walk
at
first
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
make
inquiries
at
the
chinese
restaurant
regarding
the
identity
of
the
girl
whom
he
had
met
there
but
he
quickly
changed
his
mind
and
crossing
the
river
he
followed
the
trail
which
they
had
taken
the
preceding
night
for
a
few
moments
he
contemplated
the
marks
of
the
conflict
in
the
snow
where
he
had
first
seen
the
there
were
blotches
of
blood
on
the
crust
good
for
croisset
howland
muttered
good
for
croisset
it
looks
as
though
he
used
a
knife
he
could
see
where
the
wounded
man
had
dragged
himself
up
the
trail
finally
staggering
to
his
feet
and
with
a
caution
which
he
had
not
exercised
a
few
hours
before
howland
continued
slowly
between
the
thick
forest
walls
one
hand
clutching
the
butt
of
the
revolver
in
his
coat
pocket
where
the
trail
twisted
abruptly
into
the
north
he
found
the
charred
remains
of
a
in
a
small
open
and
just
beyond
it
a
number
of
birch
toggles
which
had
undoubtedly
been
used
in
place
of
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
he
kicked
among
the
ashes
and
bits
of
wood
there
was
no
sign
of
smoke
not
a
living
spark
to
give
evidence
that
human
presence
had
been
there
for
many
hours
there
was
but
one
conclusion
to
make
soon
after
their
unsuccessful
attempt
on
his
life
his
strange
assailants
had
broken
camp
and
fled
with
them
in
all
probability
had
gone
the
girl
whose
soft
eyes
and
sweet
face
had
lured
him
within
their
reach
but
where
had
they
gone
carefully
he
examined
the
abandoned
camp
in
the
hard
crust
were
the
imprints
of
dogs
claws
in
several
places
he
found
the
faint
broad
impression
made
by
a
toboggan
the
marks
at
least
cleared
away
the
mystery
of
their
disappearance
sometime
during
the
night
they
had
fled
by
into
the
north
he
was
tired
when
he
returned
to
the
hotel
and
it
was
rather
with
a
sense
of
disappointment
than
pleasure
that
he
learned
the
was
to
leave
for
le
pas
late
that
night
instead
of
the
next
day
after
a
quiet
hour
rest
in
his
room
however
his
old
enthusiasm
returned
to
him
he
found
himself
feverishly
anxious
to
reach
le
pas
and
the
big
camp
on
the
wekusko
croisset
warning
for
him
to
turn
back
into
the
south
instead
of
deterring
him
urged
him
on
he
was
born
a
fighter
it
was
by
fighting
that
he
had
forced
his
way
round
by
round
up
the
ladder
of
success
and
now
the
fact
that
his
life
was
in
danger
that
some
mysterious
peril
awaited
him
in
the
depths
of
the
wilderness
but
added
a
new
and
thrilling
fascination
to
the
tremendous
task
which
was
ahead
of
him
he
wondered
if
this
same
peril
had
beset
gregson
and
thorne
and
if
it
was
the
cause
of
their
failure
of
their
anxiety
to
return
to
civilization
he
assured
himself
that
he
would
know
when
he
met
them
at
le
pas
he
would
discover
more
when
he
became
a
part
of
the
camp
on
the
wekusko
that
is
if
the
warning
held
any
significance
at
all
and
he
believed
that
it
did
anyway
he
would
prepare
for
developments
so
he
went
to
a
bought
a
and
a
holster
and
added
to
it
a
like
that
he
had
seen
carried
by
croisset
it
was
near
midnight
when
he
boarded
the
and
dawn
was
just
beginning
to
break
over
the
wilderness
when
it
stopped
at
etomami
from
which
point
he
was
to
travel
by
over
the
sixty
miles
of
new
road
that
had
been
constructed
as
far
north
as
le
pas
for
three
days
the
car
had
been
waiting
for
the
new
chief
of
the
road
but
neither
gregson
nor
thorne
was
with
it
gregson
is
waiting
for
you
at
le
pas
said
one
of
the
men
who
had
come
with
it
thorne
is
at
wekusko
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
howland
now
plunged
into
the
heart
of
the
wilderness
and
as
mile
after
mile
slipped
behind
them
and
he
sped
deeper
into
the
peopleless
desolation
of
ice
and
snow
and
forest
his
blood
leaped
in
swift
excitement
in
the
new
joy
of
life
which
he
was
finding
up
here
under
the
far
northern
skies
seated
on
the
front
of
the
car
with
the
four
men
pumping
behind
him
he
drank
in
the
wild
beauties
of
the
forests
and
swamps
through
which
they
slipped
his
eyes
constantly
on
the
alert
for
signs
of
the
big
game
which
his
companions
told
him
was
on
all
sides
of
them
everywhere
about
them
lay
white
winter
the
rocks
the
trees
and
the
great
ridges
which
in
this
north
country
are
called
mountains
were
covered
with
four
feet
of
snow
and
on
it
the
sun
shone
with
dazzling
brilliancy
but
it
was
not
until
a
long
grade
brought
them
to
the
top
of
one
of
these
ridges
and
howland
looked
into
the
north
that
he
saw
the
wilderness
in
all
of
its
grandeur
as
the
car
stopped
he
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
joyous
cry
his
face
aflame
with
what
he
saw
ahead
of
him
stretching
away
under
his
eyes
mile
after
mile
was
the
vast
white
desolation
that
reached
to
hudson
bay
in
speechless
wonder
he
gazed
down
on
the
unblazed
forests
saw
plains
and
hills
unfold
themselves
as
his
vision
gained
distance
followed
a
frozen
river
until
it
was
lost
in
the
bewildering
picture
and
let
his
eyes
rest
here
and
there
on
the
glistening
bosoms
of
lakes
rimmed
in
by
walls
of
black
forest
this
was
not
the
wilderness
as
he
had
expected
it
to
be
nor
as
he
had
often
read
of
it
in
books
it
was
not
the
wilderness
that
gregson
and
thorne
had
described
in
their
letters
it
was
beautiful
it
was
magnificent
his
heart
throbbed
with
pleasure
as
he
gazed
down
on
it
the
flush
grew
deeper
in
his
face
and
he
seemed
hardly
to
breathe
in
his
tense
interest
one
of
the
four
on
the
car
was
an
old
indian
and
it
was
he
strangely
enough
who
broke
the
silence
he
had
seen
the
look
in
howland
face
and
he
spoke
softly
close
to
his
ear
twent
moose
down
there
twent
no
man
no
house
more
miles
howland
even
quivering
in
his
new
emotion
looked
into
the
old
warrior
eyes
filled
with
the
curious
thrilling
gleam
of
the
spirit
which
was
stirring
within
himself
then
again
he
stared
straight
out
into
the
unending
distance
as
though
his
vision
would
penetrate
far
beyond
the
last
of
that
visible
desolation
on
and
on
even
to
the
grim
and
uttermost
fastnesses
of
hudson
bay
and
as
he
looked
he
knew
that
in
these
moments
there
had
been
born
in
him
a
new
spirit
a
new
being
that
no
longer
was
he
the
old
jack
howland
whose
world
had
been
confined
by
office
walls
and
into
whose
conception
of
life
there
had
seldom
entered
things
other
than
those
which
led
directly
toward
the
achievement
of
his
ambitions
the
short
northern
day
was
nearing
an
end
when
once
more
they
saw
the
broad
saskatchewan
twisting
through
a
plain
below
them
and
on
its
southern
shore
the
few
log
buildings
of
le
pas
hemmed
in
on
three
sides
by
the
black
forests
of
balsam
and
spruce
lights
were
burning
in
the
cabins
and
in
the
hudson
bay
post
store
when
the
car
was
brought
to
a
halt
half
a
hundred
paces
from
a
squat
structure
which
was
more
brilliantly
illuminated
than
any
of
the
others
that
the
hotel
said
one
of
the
men
gregson
there
a
tall
figure
hurried
forth
to
meet
howland
as
he
walked
briskly
across
the
open
it
was
gregson
as
the
two
men
gripped
hands
the
young
engineer
stared
at
the
other
in
astonishment
this
was
not
the
gregson
he
had
known
in
the
chicago
office
full
of
life
as
active
as
a
cricket
never
so
glad
to
see
any
one
in
my
life
howland
he
cried
shaking
the
other
hand
again
and
again
another
month
and
i
be
dead
this
a
hell
of
a
country
i
falling
more
in
love
with
it
at
every
breath
gregson
what
the
matter
have
you
been
sick
gregson
laughed
as
they
turned
toward
the
lighted
building
it
was
a
short
nervous
laugh
and
with
it
he
gave
a
curious
sidewise
glance
at
his
companion
face
sick
yes
sick
of
the
job
if
the
old
man
had
sent
us
relief
thorne
and
i
would
have
thrown
up
the
whole
thing
in
another
four
weeks
i
warrant
you
get
your
everlasting
fill
of
log
shanties
and
and
moose
meat
and
this
infernal
snow
and
ice
before
spring
comes
but
i
do
want
to
discourage
you
ca
discourage
me
laughed
howland
cheerfully
you
know
i
never
cared
much
for
theaters
and
girls
he
added
slyly
giving
gregson
a
nudge
how
about
up
here
nothing
not
a
cursed
thing
suddenly
his
eyes
lighted
up
by
george
howland
but
i
see
the
prettiest
girl
i
ever
laid
my
eyes
on
i
give
a
box
of
pure
havanas
and
we
have
had
one
for
a
month
if
i
could
know
who
she
is
they
had
entered
through
the
low
door
of
the
log
and
gregson
was
throwing
off
his
heavy
coat
a
tall
girl
with
a
fur
hat
and
muff
queried
howland
eagerly
nothing
of
the
sort
she
was
a
typical
northerner
if
there
ever
was
one
straight
as
a
birch
dressed
in
fur
cap
and
coat
short
caribou
skin
skirt
and
moccasins
and
with
a
braid
hanging
down
her
back
as
long
as
my
arm
lord
but
she
was
pretty
is
there
a
girl
somewhere
up
around
our
camp
named
meleese
asked
howland
casually
never
heard
of
her
said
gregson
or
a
man
named
croisset
never
heard
of
him
the
deuce
but
you
interesting
laughed
the
young
engineer
sniffing
at
the
odors
of
cooking
supper
i
as
hungry
as
a
bear
from
outside
there
came
the
sharp
cracking
of
a
whip
and
gregson
went
to
one
of
the
small
windows
looking
out
upon
the
clearing
in
another
instant
he
sprang
toward
the
door
crying
out
to
howland
by
the
god
of
love
there
she
is
old
man
quick
if
you
want
to
get
a
glimpse
of
her
he
flung
the
door
open
and
howland
hurried
to
his
side
there
came
another
crack
of
the
whip
a
loud
shout
and
a
sledge
drawn
by
six
dogs
sped
past
them
into
the
gathering
gloom
of
the
early
night
from
howland
lips
too
there
fell
a
sudden
cry
for
one
of
the
two
faces
that
were
turned
toward
him
for
an
instant
was
that
of
croisset
and
the
other
white
and
staring
as
he
had
seen
it
that
first
night
in
prince
albert
was
the
face
of
the
beautiful
girl
who
had
lured
him
into
the
ambush
on
the
great
north
trail
chapter
v
howland
midnight
visitor
for
a
moment
after
the
swift
passing
of
the
sledge
it
was
on
lips
to
shout
croisset
name
as
he
thrust
gregson
aside
and
leaped
out
into
the
night
he
was
impelled
with
a
desire
to
give
chase
to
overtake
in
some
way
the
two
people
who
within
the
space
of
hours
had
become
so
mysteriously
associated
with
his
own
life
and
who
were
now
escaping
him
again
it
was
gregson
who
recalled
him
to
his
senses
i
thought
you
did
care
for
theaters
howland
he
exclaimed
banteringly
repeating
howland
words
of
a
few
minutes
before
a
pretty
face
affects
you
a
little
differently
up
here
eh
well
after
you
been
in
this
of
the
universe
for
a
month
or
so
you
learn
howland
interrupted
him
sharply
did
you
ever
see
either
of
them
before
gregson
never
until
but
there
hope
old
man
surely
we
can
find
some
one
in
the
place
who
knows
them
would
it
be
jolly
good
fun
if
jack
howland
esquire
who
has
never
been
interested
in
theaters
and
girls
should
come
up
into
these
regions
and
develop
a
case
of
love
at
first
sight
by
the
great
north
trail
i
tell
you
it
may
not
be
as
uninteresting
for
you
as
it
has
been
for
thorne
and
me
if
i
had
only
seen
her
sooner
shut
up
growled
howland
betraying
irritability
for
the
first
time
let
go
in
to
supper
good
and
i
move
that
we
investigate
these
people
while
we
are
smoking
our
cigars
it
will
pass
our
time
away
at
least
your
taste
is
good
gregson
said
howland
recovering
his
as
they
seated
themselves
at
one
of
the
rough
board
tables
in
the
inwardly
he
was
convinced
it
would
be
best
to
keep
to
himself
the
incidents
of
the
past
two
days
and
nights
it
was
a
beautiful
face
and
the
eyes
added
gregson
his
own
gleaming
with
enthusiasm
she
looked
at
me
squarely
this
afternoon
when
she
and
that
dark
fellow
passed
and
i
swear
they
the
most
beautiful
eyes
i
ever
saw
and
her
hair
do
you
think
that
she
knew
you
asked
howland
quietly
gregson
hunched
his
shoulders
how
the
deuce
could
she
know
me
then
why
did
she
look
at
you
so
trying
to
flirt
do
you
suppose
surprise
shot
into
gregson
face
by
thunder
no
she
was
flirting
he
exclaimed
i
stake
my
life
on
that
a
man
never
got
a
clearer
more
sinless
look
than
she
gave
me
and
yet
why
deuce
take
it
she
at
me
i
did
see
her
again
after
that
but
the
dark
fellow
was
in
here
half
of
the
afternoon
and
now
that
i
come
to
think
of
it
he
did
show
some
interest
in
me
why
do
you
ask
just
curiosity
replied
howland
i
do
like
flirts
neither
do
i
said
gregson
musingly
their
supper
came
on
and
they
conversed
but
little
until
its
end
howland
had
watched
his
companion
closely
and
was
satisfied
that
he
knew
nothing
of
croisset
or
the
girl
the
fact
puzzled
him
more
than
ever
how
gregson
and
thorne
two
of
the
best
engineers
in
the
country
could
voluntarily
surrender
a
task
like
the
building
of
the
hudson
bay
railroad
simply
because
they
were
tired
of
the
country
was
more
than
he
could
understand
it
was
not
until
they
were
about
to
leave
the
table
that
howland
eyes
accidentally
fell
on
gregson
left
hand
he
gave
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
when
he
saw
that
the
little
finger
was
missing
gregson
jerked
the
hand
to
his
side
a
little
accident
he
explained
you
meet
up
here
howland
before
he
could
move
the
young
engineer
had
caught
his
arm
and
was
looking
closely
at
the
hand
a
curious
wound
he
remarked
without
looking
up
funny
i
notice
it
before
your
finger
was
cut
off
lengthwise
and
here
the
scar
running
half
way
to
your
wrist
how
did
you
do
it
he
dropped
the
hand
in
time
to
see
a
nervous
flush
in
the
other
face
why
er
fact
is
howland
it
was
shot
off
several
months
ago
in
an
accident
of
course
he
hurried
through
the
door
continuing
to
speak
over
his
shoulder
as
he
went
now
for
those
cigars
and
our
investigation
as
they
passed
from
the
into
that
part
of
the
inn
which
was
half
bar
and
half
already
filled
with
smoke
and
a
dozen
or
so
picturesque
citizens
of
le
pas
the
proprietor
of
the
place
motioned
to
howland
and
held
out
a
letter
this
came
while
you
was
at
supper
howland
he
explained
the
engineer
gave
an
inward
start
when
he
saw
the
writing
on
the
envelope
and
as
he
tore
it
open
he
turned
so
that
gregson
could
see
neither
his
face
nor
the
slip
of
paper
which
he
drew
forth
there
was
no
name
at
the
bottom
of
what
he
read
it
was
not
necessary
for
a
glance
had
told
him
that
the
writing
was
that
of
the
girl
whose
face
he
had
seen
again
that
night
and
her
words
to
him
this
time
despite
his
caution
drew
a
low
whistle
from
his
lips
forgive
me
for
what
i
have
done
the
note
ran
believe
me
now
your
life
is
in
danger
and
you
must
go
back
to
etomami
if
you
go
to
the
wekusko
camp
you
will
not
live
to
come
back
the
devil
he
exclaimed
what
that
asked
gregson
edging
around
him
curiously
howland
crushed
the
note
in
his
hand
and
thrust
it
into
one
of
his
pockets
a
little
private
affair
he
laughed
comes
gregson
let
see
what
we
can
discover
in
the
gloom
outside
one
of
his
hands
slipped
under
his
coat
and
rested
on
the
butt
of
his
revolver
until
ten
they
mixed
casually
among
the
populace
of
le
pas
half
a
hundred
people
had
seen
croisset
and
his
beautiful
companion
but
no
one
knew
anything
about
them
they
had
come
that
forenoon
on
a
sledge
had
eaten
their
dinner
and
supper
at
the
cabin
of
a
scotch
named
macdonald
and
had
left
on
a
sledge
she
was
the
sweetest
thing
i
ever
saw
exclaimed
macdonald
rapturously
only
she
could
talk
two
or
three
times
she
wrote
things
to
me
on
a
slip
of
paper
could
talk
repeated
gregson
as
the
two
men
walked
leisurely
back
to
the
what
the
deuce
do
you
suppose
that
means
jack
i
not
supposing
replied
howland
indifferently
we
had
enough
of
this
pretty
face
gregson
i
going
to
bed
what
time
do
we
start
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
we
had
breakfast
if
you
anxious
i
am
good
night
howland
went
to
his
room
but
it
was
not
to
sleep
for
hours
he
sat
smoking
cigar
after
cigar
and
thinking
one
by
one
he
went
over
the
bewildering
incidents
of
the
past
two
days
at
first
they
had
stirred
his
blood
with
a
certain
exhilaration
a
spice
of
excitement
which
was
not
at
all
unpleasant
but
with
this
excitement
there
was
now
a
peculiar
sense
of
oppression
the
attempt
that
had
already
been
made
on
his
life
together
with
the
persistent
warnings
for
him
to
return
into
the
south
began
to
have
their
effect
but
howland
was
not
a
man
to
surrender
to
his
fears
if
they
could
be
called
fears
he
was
satisfied
that
a
mysterious
peril
of
some
kind
awaited
him
at
the
camp
on
the
wekusko
but
he
gave
up
trying
to
fathom
the
reason
for
this
peril
accepting
in
his
businesslike
way
the
fact
that
it
did
exist
and
that
in
a
short
time
it
would
probably
explain
itself
the
one
puzzling
factor
which
he
could
not
drive
out
of
his
thoughts
was
the
girl
her
sweet
face
haunted
him
at
every
turn
he
saw
it
now
over
the
table
in
the
opium
den
now
in
the
white
starlight
of
the
trail
again
as
it
had
looked
at
him
for
an
instant
from
the
sledge
vainly
he
strove
to
discover
for
himself
the
lurking
of
sin
in
the
pure
eyes
that
had
seemed
to
plead
for
his
friendship
in
the
soft
lips
that
had
lied
to
him
because
of
their
silence
please
forgive
me
for
what
i
have
done
he
unfolded
the
crumpled
note
and
read
the
words
again
and
again
believe
me
now
she
knew
that
he
knew
that
she
had
lied
to
him
that
she
had
lured
him
into
the
danger
from
which
she
now
wished
to
save
him
his
cheeks
burned
if
a
thousand
perils
threatened
him
on
the
wekusko
he
would
still
go
he
would
meet
the
girl
again
despite
his
strongest
efforts
he
found
it
impossible
to
destroy
the
vision
of
her
beautiful
face
the
eyes
soft
with
appeal
the
red
mouth
quivering
and
with
lips
parted
as
if
about
to
speak
to
him
the
head
as
he
had
looked
down
on
it
with
its
glory
of
shining
hair
all
had
burned
themselves
on
his
soul
in
a
picture
too
deep
to
be
eradicated
if
the
wilderness
was
interesting
to
him
before
it
was
doubly
so
now
because
that
face
was
a
part
of
it
because
the
secret
of
its
life
of
the
misery
that
it
had
half
confessed
to
him
was
hidden
somewhere
out
in
the
black
mystery
of
the
spruce
and
balsam
forests
he
went
to
bed
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
fell
asleep
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
scarcely
closed
his
eyes
when
a
pounding
on
the
door
aroused
him
and
he
awoke
to
find
the
early
light
of
dawn
creeping
through
the
narrow
window
of
his
room
a
few
minutes
later
he
joined
gregson
who
was
ready
for
breakfast
the
sledge
and
dogs
are
waiting
he
greeted
as
they
seated
themselves
at
the
table
he
added
i
changed
my
mind
since
last
night
howland
i
not
going
back
with
you
it
absolutely
unnecessary
for
thorne
can
put
you
on
to
everything
at
the
camp
and
i
rather
lose
six
months
salary
than
take
that
sledge
ride
again
you
wo
mind
will
you
howland
hunched
his
shoulders
to
be
honest
gregson
i
do
believe
you
be
particularly
cheerful
company
what
sort
of
fellow
is
the
driver
we
call
him
jackpine
a
cree
indian
and
he
the
one
faithful
slave
of
thorne
and
myself
at
wekusko
hunts
for
us
cooks
for
us
and
watches
after
things
generally
you
like
him
all
right
howland
did
when
they
went
out
to
the
sledge
after
their
breakfast
he
gave
jackpine
a
hearty
grip
of
the
hand
and
the
cree
dark
face
lighted
up
with
something
like
pleasure
when
he
saw
the
enthusiasm
in
the
young
engineer
eyes
when
the
moment
for
parting
came
gregson
pulled
his
companion
a
little
to
one
side
his
eyes
shifted
nervously
and
howland
saw
that
he
was
making
a
strong
effort
to
assume
an
indifference
which
was
not
at
all
gregson
natural
self
just
a
word
howland
he
said
you
know
this
is
a
pretty
rough
country
up
here
some
tough
people
in
it
who
would
mind
cutting
a
man
throat
or
sending
a
bullet
through
him
for
a
good
team
of
dogs
and
a
rifle
i
just
telling
you
this
so
you
be
on
your
guard
have
jackpine
watch
your
camp
nights
he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
and
cut
himself
short
when
the
indian
approached
howland
seated
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
toboggan
waved
his
hand
to
gregson
then
with
a
wild
halloo
and
a
snapping
of
his
long
whip
jackpine
started
his
dogs
on
a
trot
down
the
street
running
close
beside
the
sledge
howland
had
lighted
a
cigar
and
leaning
back
in
a
soft
mass
of
furs
began
to
enjoy
his
new
experience
hugely
day
was
just
fairly
breaking
over
the
forests
when
they
turned
into
the
white
trail
already
beaten
hard
by
the
passing
of
many
dogs
and
sledges
that
led
from
le
pas
for
a
hundred
miles
to
the
camp
on
the
wekusko
as
they
struck
the
trail
the
dogs
strained
harder
at
their
traces
with
jackpine
whip
curling
and
snapping
over
their
backs
until
they
were
leaping
swiftly
and
with
unbroken
rhythm
of
motion
over
the
snow
then
the
cree
gathered
in
his
whip
and
ran
close
to
the
leader
flank
his
moccasined
feet
taking
the
short
quick
light
steps
of
the
trained
forest
runner
his
chest
thrown
a
little
out
his
eyes
on
the
twisting
trail
ahead
it
was
a
glorious
ride
and
in
the
exhilaration
of
it
howland
forgot
to
smoke
the
cigar
that
he
held
between
his
fingers
his
blood
thrilled
to
the
tireless
effort
of
the
pack
of
magnificent
brutes
ahead
of
him
he
watched
the
muscular
play
of
their
backs
and
legs
the
eager
of
their
wolfish
heads
their
jaws
and
from
them
he
looked
at
jackpine
there
was
no
effort
in
his
running
his
black
hair
swept
back
from
the
gray
of
his
cap
like
the
dogs
there
was
music
in
his
movement
the
beauty
of
strength
of
endurance
of
manhood
born
to
the
forests
and
when
the
dogs
finally
stopped
at
the
foot
of
a
huge
ridge
panting
and
half
exhausted
howland
quickly
leaped
from
the
sledge
and
for
the
first
time
spoke
to
the
indian
that
was
glorious
jackpine
he
cried
but
good
lord
man
kill
the
dogs
jackpine
grinned
they
go
sixt
mile
in
day
lak
dat
he
grinned
sixty
miles
in
his
admiration
for
the
wolfish
looking
beasts
that
were
carrying
him
through
the
wilderness
howland
put
out
a
hand
to
stroke
one
of
them
on
the
head
with
a
warning
cry
the
indian
jerked
him
back
just
as
the
dog
snapped
fiercely
at
the
extended
hand
no
touch
huskie
he
exclaimed
heem
half
wolf
half
dog
work
hard
but
no
lak
to
be
touch
wow
exclaimed
howland
and
they
the
sweetest
looking
pups
i
ever
laid
eyes
on
i
certainly
running
up
against
some
strange
things
in
this
country
he
was
dead
tired
when
night
came
and
yet
never
in
all
his
life
had
he
enjoyed
a
day
so
much
as
this
one
twenty
times
he
had
joined
jackpine
in
running
beside
the
sledge
in
their
intervals
of
rest
he
had
even
learned
to
snap
the
lash
of
the
he
had
asked
a
hundred
questions
had
insisted
on
jackpine
smoking
a
cigar
at
every
stop
and
had
been
so
happy
and
so
altogether
companionable
that
half
of
the
cree
hereditary
reticence
had
been
swept
away
before
his
unbounded
enthusiasm
he
helped
to
build
their
balsam
shelter
for
the
night
ate
a
huge
supper
of
moose
meat
biscuits
beans
and
coffee
and
then
just
as
he
had
stretched
himself
out
in
his
furs
for
the
night
he
remembered
gregson
warning
he
sat
up
and
called
to
jackpine
who
was
putting
a
fresh
log
on
the
big
fire
in
front
of
the
shelter
gregson
told
me
to
be
sure
and
have
the
camp
guarded
at
night
jackpine
what
do
you
think
about
it
the
indian
turned
with
a
queer
chuckles
his
lathery
face
wrinkled
in
a
grin
gregson
heem
ver
much
he
replied
no
bad
man
here
all
down
there
and
in
camp
we
kep
watch
evr
night
heem
i
guess
so
mebby
afraid
of
what
for
a
moment
jackpine
was
silent
half
bending
over
the
fire
then
he
held
out
his
left
hand
with
the
little
finger
doubled
out
of
sight
and
pointed
to
it
with
his
other
hand
mebby
heem
finger
mebby
not
he
said
a
dozen
eager
questions
brought
no
further
suggestions
from
jackpine
in
fact
no
sooner
had
the
words
fallen
from
his
driver
lips
than
howland
saw
that
the
indian
was
sorry
he
had
spoken
them
what
he
had
said
strengthened
the
conviction
which
was
slowly
growing
within
him
he
had
wondered
at
gregson
strange
demeanor
his
evident
anxiety
to
get
out
of
the
country
and
lastly
at
his
desire
not
to
return
to
the
camp
on
the
wekusko
with
him
there
was
but
one
solution
that
came
to
him
in
some
way
which
he
could
not
fathom
gregson
was
associated
with
the
mystery
which
enveloped
him
and
adding
the
senior
nervousness
to
the
significance
of
jackpine
words
he
was
confident
that
the
missing
finger
had
become
a
factor
in
the
enigma
how
should
he
find
thorne
surely
he
would
give
him
an
explanation
if
there
was
an
explanation
to
give
or
was
it
possible
that
they
would
leave
him
without
warning
to
face
a
situation
which
was
driving
them
back
to
civilization
he
went
to
sleep
giving
no
further
thought
to
the
guarding
of
the
camp
a
piping
hot
breakfast
was
ready
when
jackpine
awakened
him
and
once
more
the
exhilarating
excitement
of
their
swift
race
through
the
forests
relieved
him
of
the
uncomfortable
mental
tension
under
which
he
began
to
find
himself
during
the
whole
of
the
day
jackpine
urged
the
dogs
almost
to
the
limit
of
their
endurance
and
early
in
the
afternoon
assured
his
companion
that
they
would
reach
the
wekusko
by
nightfall
it
was
already
dark
when
they
came
out
of
the
forest
into
a
broad
stretch
of
cutting
beyond
which
howland
caught
the
glimmer
of
scattered
lights
at
the
farther
edge
of
the
clearing
the
cree
brought
his
dogs
to
a
halt
close
to
a
large
cabin
half
sheltered
among
the
trees
it
was
situated
several
hundred
yards
from
the
nearest
of
the
lights
ahead
and
the
unbroken
snow
about
it
showed
that
it
had
not
been
used
as
a
habitation
for
some
time
jackpine
drew
a
key
from
his
pocket
and
without
a
word
unlocked
and
swung
open
the
heavy
door
damp
cold
air
swept
into
the
faces
of
the
two
as
they
stood
for
a
moment
peering
into
the
gloom
howland
could
hear
the
cree
chuckling
in
his
inimitable
way
as
he
struck
a
match
and
as
a
big
hanging
oil
lamp
flared
slowly
into
light
he
turned
a
grinning
face
to
the
engineer
gregson
um
thorne
heem
mak
thees
cabin
when
first
kam
to
camp
he
said
softly
no
be
near
much
noise
fine
place
in
woods
where
be
quiet
nights
live
here
time
then
gregson
um
thorne
go
live
in
camp
say
too
far
from
man
but
that
not
so
thorne
gregson
he
hunched
his
shoulders
again
as
he
opened
the
door
of
the
big
box
stove
which
stood
in
the
room
howland
asked
no
questions
but
stared
about
him
everywhere
he
saw
evidences
of
the
taste
and
tenancies
of
the
two
senior
engineers
heavy
bear
rugs
lay
on
the
board
floor
the
log
walls
hewn
almost
to
polished
smoothness
were
hung
with
half
a
dozen
pictures
in
one
corner
was
a
bookcase
still
filled
with
books
in
another
a
lounge
covered
with
furs
and
in
this
side
of
the
room
was
a
door
which
howland
supposed
must
open
into
the
sleeping
apartment
a
fire
was
roaring
in
the
big
stove
before
he
finished
his
inspection
and
as
he
squared
his
shivering
back
to
the
heat
he
pulled
out
his
pipe
and
smiled
cheerfully
at
jackpine
afraid
eh
and
am
i
to
stay
here
gregson
um
thorne
say
yes
well
jackpine
you
just
hustle
over
to
the
camp
and
tell
thorne
here
will
you
for
a
moment
the
indian
hesitated
then
went
out
and
closed
the
door
after
him
afraid
exclaimed
howland
when
he
had
gone
now
what
the
devil
are
they
afraid
of
it
deuced
queer
gregson
and
ditto
thorne
if
not
the
cowards
i
half
believing
you
to
be
you
wo
leave
me
in
the
dark
to
face
something
from
which
you
are
running
away
he
lighted
a
small
lamp
and
opened
the
door
leading
into
the
other
room
it
was
as
he
had
surmised
the
sleeping
chamber
the
bed
a
single
chair
and
a
mirror
and
stand
were
its
sole
furnishing
returning
to
the
larger
room
he
threw
off
his
coat
and
hat
and
seated
himself
comfortably
before
the
fire
ten
minutes
later
the
door
opened
again
and
jackpine
entered
he
was
supporting
another
figure
by
the
arm
and
as
howland
stared
into
the
bloodless
face
of
the
man
who
came
with
him
he
could
not
repress
the
exclamation
of
astonishment
which
rose
to
his
lips
three
months
before
he
had
last
seen
thorne
in
chicago
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
powerfully
built
as
straight
as
a
tree
the
most
efficient
and
highest
paid
man
in
the
company
employ
how
often
had
he
envied
thorne
for
years
he
had
been
his
ideal
of
a
great
engineer
and
now
he
stood
speechless
slowly
as
if
the
movement
gave
him
pain
thorne
slipped
off
the
great
fur
coat
from
about
his
shoulders
one
of
his
arms
was
suspended
in
a
sling
his
huge
shoulders
were
bent
his
eyes
wild
and
haggard
the
smile
that
came
to
his
lips
as
he
held
out
a
hand
to
howland
gave
to
his
face
an
appearance
even
more
ghastly
hello
jack
he
greeted
what
the
matter
man
do
i
look
like
a
ghost
what
is
the
matter
thorne
i
found
gregson
half
dying
at
le
pas
and
now
you
it
a
wonder
you
not
reading
my
name
on
a
little
board
slab
instead
of
seeing
yours
truly
in
flesh
and
blood
jack
laughed
thorne
nervously
a
ton
of
rock
man
a
ton
of
rock
and
i
was
under
it
over
thorne
shoulder
the
young
engineer
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
face
a
dark
flash
had
shot
into
his
eyes
his
teeth
gleamed
for
an
instant
between
his
tense
lips
in
something
that
might
have
been
a
sneer
thorne
sat
down
rubbing
his
hands
before
the
fire
we
been
unfortunate
jack
he
said
slowly
gregson
and
i
have
had
the
worst
kind
of
luck
since
the
day
we
struck
this
camp
and
we
no
longer
fit
for
the
job
it
will
take
us
six
months
to
get
on
our
feet
again
you
find
everything
here
in
good
condition
the
line
is
blazed
straight
to
the
bay
we
got
three
hundred
good
men
plenty
of
supplies
and
so
far
as
i
know
you
not
find
a
disaffected
hand
on
the
wekusko
probably
gregson
and
i
will
take
hold
of
the
le
pas
end
of
the
line
in
the
spring
it
certainly
up
to
you
to
build
the
roadway
to
the
bay
i
sorry
things
have
gone
badly
replied
howland
he
leaned
forward
until
his
face
was
close
to
his
companion
thorne
is
there
a
man
up
here
named
croisset
or
a
girl
called
meleese
he
watched
the
senior
engineer
closely
nothing
to
confirm
his
suspicions
came
into
thorne
face
thorne
looked
up
a
little
surprised
at
the
tone
of
the
other
voice
not
that
i
know
of
jack
there
may
be
a
man
named
croisset
among
our
three
hundred
workers
you
can
tell
by
looking
at
the
there
are
fifteen
or
twenty
married
men
among
us
and
they
have
families
gregson
knows
more
about
the
girls
than
i
anything
particular
just
a
word
i
got
for
them
if
they
here
replied
howland
carelessly
are
these
my
quarters
if
you
like
them
when
i
got
hurt
we
moved
up
among
the
men
brought
us
into
closer
touch
with
the
working
end
you
know
you
and
gregson
must
have
been
laid
up
at
about
the
same
time
said
the
young
engineer
that
was
a
painful
wound
of
gregson
i
wonder
who
the
deuce
it
was
who
shot
him
funny
that
a
man
like
gregson
should
have
an
enemy
thorne
sat
up
with
a
jerk
there
came
the
rattle
of
a
pan
from
the
stove
and
howland
turned
his
head
in
time
to
see
jackpine
staring
at
him
as
though
he
had
exploded
a
mine
under
his
feet
who
shot
him
gasped
the
senior
engineer
why
er
did
gregson
tell
you
that
it
was
an
accident
why
should
he
lie
thorne
a
faint
flush
swept
into
the
other
pallid
face
for
a
moment
there
was
a
penetrating
glare
in
his
eyes
as
he
looked
at
howland
jackpine
still
stood
silent
and
motionless
beside
the
stove
he
told
me
that
it
was
an
accident
said
thorne
at
last
funny
was
all
that
howland
said
turning
to
the
indian
as
though
the
matter
was
of
no
importance
ah
jackpine
i
glad
to
see
the
on
i
got
a
box
of
the
blackest
and
mildest
porto
ricans
you
ever
laid
eyes
on
in
my
kit
thorne
and
we
open
up
for
a
good
smoke
after
supper
hello
why
have
you
got
boards
nailed
over
that
window
for
the
first
time
howland
noticed
that
the
thin
muslin
curtain
which
he
thought
had
screened
a
window
concealed
in
place
of
a
window
a
carefully
fitted
barricade
of
plank
a
sudden
thrill
shot
through
him
as
he
rose
to
examine
it
with
his
back
toward
thorne
he
said
half
laughing
perhaps
gregson
was
afraid
that
the
fellow
who
clipped
off
his
finger
would
get
him
through
the
window
eh
he
pretended
not
to
perceive
the
effect
of
his
words
on
the
senior
engineer
the
two
sat
down
to
supper
and
for
an
hour
after
they
had
finished
they
smoked
and
talked
on
the
business
of
the
camp
it
was
ten
when
thorne
and
jackpine
left
the
cabin
no
sooner
had
they
gone
than
howland
closed
and
barred
the
door
lighted
another
cigar
and
began
pacing
rapidly
up
and
down
the
room
already
there
were
developments
gregson
had
lied
to
him
about
his
finger
thorne
had
lied
to
him
about
his
own
injuries
whatever
they
were
he
was
certain
of
these
two
things
and
of
more
the
two
senior
engineers
were
not
leaving
the
wekusko
because
of
mere
dissatisfaction
with
the
work
and
country
they
were
fleeing
and
for
some
reason
they
were
keeping
from
him
the
real
motive
for
their
flight
was
it
possible
that
they
were
deliberately
sacrificing
him
in
order
to
save
themselves
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
this
notwithstanding
the
evidence
against
them
both
were
men
of
irreproachable
honor
thorne
especially
was
a
man
of
indomitable
nerve
a
man
who
would
be
the
last
in
the
world
to
prove
treacherous
to
a
business
associate
or
a
friend
he
was
sure
that
neither
of
them
knew
of
croisset
or
of
the
beautiful
girl
whom
he
had
met
at
prince
albert
which
led
him
to
believe
that
there
were
other
characters
in
the
strange
plot
in
which
he
had
become
involved
besides
those
whom
he
had
encountered
on
the
great
north
trail
again
he
examined
the
barricaded
window
and
he
was
more
than
ever
convinced
that
his
chance
hit
at
thorne
had
struck
true
he
was
tired
from
his
long
day
travel
but
little
inclination
to
sleep
came
to
him
and
stretching
himself
out
on
the
lounge
with
his
head
and
shoulders
bolstered
up
with
furs
he
continued
to
smoke
and
think
he
was
surprised
when
a
little
clock
tinkled
the
hour
of
eleven
he
had
not
seen
the
clock
before
now
he
listened
to
the
faint
monotonous
ticking
it
made
close
to
his
head
until
he
felt
an
impelling
drowsiness
creeping
over
him
and
he
closed
his
eyes
he
was
almost
asleep
when
it
struck
again
softly
and
yet
with
sufficient
loudness
to
arouse
him
it
had
struck
twelve
with
an
effort
howland
overcame
his
drowsiness
and
dragged
himself
to
a
sitting
posture
knowing
that
he
should
undress
and
go
to
bed
the
lamp
was
still
burning
brightly
and
he
arose
to
turn
down
the
wick
suddenly
he
stopped
to
his
dulled
senses
there
came
distinctly
the
sound
of
a
knock
at
the
door
for
a
few
moments
he
waited
silent
and
motionless
it
came
again
louder
than
before
and
yet
in
it
there
was
something
of
caution
it
was
not
the
heavy
tattoo
of
one
who
had
come
to
awaken
him
on
a
matter
of
business
who
could
be
his
midnight
visitor
softly
howland
went
back
to
his
heavy
coat
and
slipped
his
small
revolver
into
his
hip
pocket
the
knock
came
again
then
he
walked
to
the
door
shot
back
the
bolt
and
with
his
right
hand
gripping
the
butt
of
his
pistol
flung
it
wide
open
for
a
moment
he
stood
transfixed
staring
speechlessly
at
a
white
startled
face
lighted
up
by
the
glow
of
the
oil
lamp
bewildered
to
the
point
of
dumbness
he
backed
slowly
holding
the
door
open
and
there
entered
the
one
person
in
all
the
world
whom
he
wished
most
to
see
she
who
had
become
so
strangely
a
part
of
his
life
since
that
first
night
at
prince
albert
and
whose
sweet
face
was
holding
a
deeper
meaning
for
him
with
every
hour
that
he
lived
he
closed
the
door
and
turned
still
without
speaking
and
impelled
by
a
sudden
spirit
that
sent
the
blood
thrilling
through
his
veins
he
held
out
both
hands
to
the
girl
for
whom
he
now
knew
that
he
was
willing
to
face
all
of
the
perils
that
might
await
him
between
civilization
and
the
bay
chapter
vi
the
love
of
a
man
for
a
moment
the
girl
hesitated
her
ungloved
hands
clenched
on
her
breast
her
bloodless
face
tense
with
a
strange
grief
as
she
saw
the
outstretched
arms
of
the
man
whom
her
treachery
had
almost
lured
to
his
death
then
slowly
she
approached
and
once
more
howland
held
her
hands
clasped
to
him
and
gazed
questioningly
down
into
the
wild
eyes
that
stared
into
his
own
why
did
you
run
away
from
me
were
the
first
words
that
he
spoke
they
came
from
him
gently
as
if
he
had
known
her
for
a
long
time
in
them
there
was
no
tone
of
bitterness
in
the
warmth
of
his
gray
eyes
there
was
none
of
the
denunciation
which
she
might
have
expected
he
repeated
the
question
bending
his
head
until
he
felt
the
soft
touch
of
her
hair
on
his
lips
why
did
you
run
away
from
me
she
drew
away
from
him
her
eyes
searching
his
face
i
lied
to
you
she
breathed
her
words
coming
to
him
in
a
whisper
i
lied
the
words
caught
in
her
throat
he
saw
her
struggling
to
control
herself
to
stop
the
quivering
of
her
lip
the
tremble
in
her
voice
in
another
moment
she
had
broken
down
and
with
a
low
sobbing
cry
sank
in
a
chair
beside
the
table
and
buried
her
head
in
her
arms
as
howland
saw
the
convulsive
trembling
of
her
shoulders
his
soul
was
flooded
with
a
strange
joy
not
at
this
sight
of
her
grief
but
at
the
knowledge
that
she
was
sorry
for
what
she
had
done
softly
he
approached
the
fur
cap
had
fallen
off
her
long
shining
braid
was
half
undone
and
its
silken
strands
fell
over
her
shoulder
and
glistened
in
the
on
the
table
his
hand
hesitated
and
then
fell
gently
on
the
bowed
head
sometimes
the
friend
who
lies
is
the
only
friend
who
true
he
said
i
believe
that
it
was
necessary
for
you
to
lie
just
once
his
hand
stroked
her
soft
hair
then
catching
himself
he
went
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
narrow
table
and
sat
down
when
the
girl
raised
her
head
there
was
a
bright
flush
in
her
cheeks
he
could
see
the
damp
stain
of
tears
on
her
face
but
there
was
no
sign
of
them
now
in
the
eyes
that
seemed
seeking
in
his
own
the
truth
of
his
words
spoken
a
few
moments
before
you
believe
that
she
questioned
eagerly
you
believe
that
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
lie
she
leaned
a
little
toward
him
her
fingers
twining
themselves
about
one
another
nervously
as
she
waited
for
him
to
answer
yes
said
howland
he
spoke
the
one
word
with
a
finality
that
sent
a
gladness
into
the
soft
brown
eyes
across
from
him
i
believe
that
you
to
lie
to
me
his
low
voice
was
vibrant
with
unbounded
faith
other
words
were
on
his
lips
but
he
forced
them
back
a
part
of
what
he
might
have
said
a
part
of
the
strange
joyous
tumult
in
his
heart
betrayed
itself
in
his
face
and
before
that
betrayal
the
girl
drew
back
slowly
the
color
fading
from
her
cheeks
and
i
believe
you
will
not
lie
to
me
again
he
said
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
flung
back
her
hair
looking
down
on
him
in
the
manner
of
one
who
had
never
before
met
this
kind
of
man
and
knew
not
what
to
make
of
him
no
i
will
not
lie
to
you
again
she
replied
more
firmly
do
you
believe
me
now
yes
then
go
back
into
the
south
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
again
to
you
believe
me
you
should
have
turned
back
at
le
pas
if
you
do
go
her
voice
seemed
to
choke
her
and
she
stood
without
finishing
leaving
him
to
understand
what
she
had
meant
to
say
in
an
instant
howland
was
at
her
side
once
more
his
old
resolute
fighting
blood
was
up
firmly
he
took
her
hands
again
his
eyes
compelling
her
to
look
up
at
him
if
i
do
go
they
will
kill
me
he
completed
repeating
the
words
of
her
note
to
him
now
if
you
are
going
to
be
honest
with
me
tell
me
this
is
going
to
kill
me
and
he
felt
a
convulsive
shudder
pass
through
her
as
she
answered
i
said
that
i
would
not
lie
to
you
again
if
i
can
not
tell
you
the
truth
i
will
tell
you
nothing
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
why
your
life
is
in
danger
but
you
know
yes
he
seated
her
again
in
the
chair
beside
the
table
and
sat
down
opposite
her
will
you
tell
me
who
you
are
she
hesitated
twisting
her
fingers
nervously
in
a
silken
strand
of
her
hair
will
you
he
persisted
if
i
tell
you
who
i
am
she
said
at
last
you
will
know
who
is
threatening
your
life
he
stated
at
her
in
astonishment
the
devil
you
say
the
words
slipped
from
his
lips
before
he
could
stop
them
for
a
second
time
the
girl
rose
from
her
chair
you
will
go
she
entreated
you
will
go
her
hand
was
on
the
latch
of
the
door
you
will
go
he
had
risen
and
was
lighting
a
cigar
over
the
chimney
of
the
lamp
laughing
he
came
toward
her
yes
surely
i
am
going
to
see
you
safely
home
suddenly
he
turned
back
to
the
lounge
and
belted
on
his
revolver
and
holster
when
he
returned
she
barred
his
way
defiantly
her
back
against
the
door
you
can
not
go
why
because
he
caught
the
frightened
flutter
of
her
voice
again
because
they
will
kill
you
the
low
laugh
that
he
breathed
in
her
hair
was
more
of
joy
than
fear
i
am
glad
that
you
care
he
whispered
to
her
softly
you
must
go
she
still
persisted
with
you
yes
he
answered
no
no
you
must
go
back
to
le
pas
back
into
the
south
will
you
promise
me
that
perhaps
he
said
i
will
tell
you
soon
she
surrendered
to
the
determination
in
his
voice
and
allowed
him
to
pass
out
into
the
night
with
her
swiftly
she
led
him
along
a
path
that
ran
into
the
deep
gloom
of
the
balsam
and
spruce
he
could
hear
the
throbbing
of
her
heart
and
her
quick
excited
breathing
as
she
stopped
one
of
her
hands
clasping
him
nervously
by
the
arm
it
is
not
very
far
from
here
she
whispered
you
must
not
go
with
me
if
they
saw
me
with
you
at
this
hour
he
felt
her
shuddering
against
him
only
a
little
farther
he
begged
she
surrendered
again
hesitatingly
and
they
went
on
more
slowly
than
before
until
they
came
to
where
a
few
faint
lights
in
the
camp
were
visible
ahead
of
them
now
now
you
must
go
howland
turned
as
if
to
obey
in
an
instant
the
girl
was
at
his
side
you
have
not
promised
she
entreated
will
you
go
in
the
luster
of
the
eyes
that
were
turned
up
to
him
in
the
gloom
howland
saw
again
the
strange
sweet
power
that
had
taken
possession
of
his
soul
it
did
not
occur
to
him
in
these
moments
that
he
had
known
this
girl
for
only
a
few
hours
that
until
he
had
heard
no
word
pass
from
her
lips
he
was
conscious
only
that
in
the
space
of
those
few
hours
something
had
come
into
his
life
which
he
had
never
known
before
and
a
deep
longing
to
tell
her
this
to
take
her
sweet
face
between
his
hands
as
they
stood
in
the
gloom
of
the
forest
and
to
confess
to
her
that
she
had
become
more
to
him
than
a
passing
vision
in
a
strange
wilderness
filled
him
that
night
he
had
forgotten
half
of
the
strenuous
lesson
he
had
striven
years
to
master
success
ambition
the
mere
joy
of
achievement
were
for
the
first
time
sunk
under
a
greater
thing
for
him
the
pulsating
human
presence
of
this
girl
and
as
he
looked
down
into
her
face
pleading
with
him
still
in
its
white
silent
terror
he
forgot
too
what
this
woman
was
or
might
have
been
knowing
only
that
to
him
she
had
opened
a
new
and
glorious
world
filled
with
a
promise
that
stirred
his
blood
like
sharp
wine
he
crushed
her
hands
once
more
to
his
breast
as
he
had
done
on
the
great
north
trail
holding
her
so
close
that
he
could
feel
the
throbbing
of
her
bosom
against
him
he
spoke
no
word
and
still
her
eyes
pleaded
with
him
to
go
suddenly
he
freed
one
of
his
hands
and
brushed
back
the
thick
hair
from
her
brow
and
turned
her
face
gently
until
what
dim
light
came
down
from
the
stars
above
glowed
in
the
beauty
of
her
eyes
in
his
own
face
she
saw
that
which
he
had
not
dared
to
speak
and
from
her
lips
there
came
a
soft
little
sobbing
cry
no
i
have
not
promised
and
i
will
not
promise
he
said
holding
her
face
so
that
she
could
not
look
away
from
him
forgive
me
for
for
doing
this
and
before
she
could
move
he
caught
her
for
a
moment
close
in
his
arms
holding
her
so
that
he
felt
the
quick
beating
of
her
heart
against
his
own
the
sweep
of
her
hair
and
breath
in
his
face
this
is
why
i
will
not
go
back
he
cried
softly
it
is
because
i
love
you
love
you
he
caught
himself
choking
back
the
words
and
as
she
drew
away
from
him
her
eyes
shone
with
a
glory
that
made
him
half
reach
out
his
arms
to
her
you
will
forgive
me
he
begged
i
do
not
mean
to
do
wrong
only
you
must
know
why
i
shall
not
go
back
into
the
south
from
her
distance
she
saw
his
arms
stretched
like
shadows
toward
her
her
voice
was
low
so
low
that
he
could
hardly
hear
the
words
she
spoke
but
its
sweetness
thrilled
him
if
you
love
me
you
will
do
this
thing
for
me
you
will
go
and
you
i
he
heard
the
tremulous
quiver
in
her
voice
very
soon
you
will
forget
that
you
have
ever
seen
me
from
down
the
path
there
came
the
sound
of
low
voices
excitedly
the
girl
ran
to
howland
thrusting
him
back
with
her
hands
go
go
she
cried
tensely
hurry
back
to
the
cabin
lock
your
door
and
do
come
out
again
oh
please
if
you
love
me
please
go
the
voices
were
approaching
howland
fancied
that
he
could
distinguish
dark
shadows
between
the
thinned
walls
of
the
forest
he
laughed
softly
i
am
not
going
to
run
little
girl
he
whispered
see
he
drew
his
revolver
so
that
it
gleamed
in
the
light
of
the
stars
with
a
frightened
gasp
the
girl
pulled
him
into
the
thick
bushes
beside
the
path
until
they
stood
a
dozen
paces
from
where
those
who
were
coming
down
the
trail
would
pass
there
was
a
silence
as
howland
slipped
his
weapon
back
into
its
holster
then
the
voices
came
again
very
near
and
at
the
sound
of
them
his
companion
shrank
close
to
him
her
hands
clutching
his
arms
her
white
frightened
face
raised
to
him
in
piteous
appeal
his
blood
leaped
through
him
like
fire
he
knew
that
the
girl
had
recognized
the
voices
that
they
who
were
about
to
pass
him
were
the
mysterious
enemies
against
whom
she
had
warned
him
perhaps
they
were
the
two
who
had
attacked
him
on
the
great
north
trail
his
muscles
grew
tense
the
girl
could
feel
them
straining
under
her
hands
could
feel
his
body
grow
rigid
and
alert
his
hand
fell
again
on
his
revolver
he
made
a
step
past
her
his
eyes
flashing
his
face
as
set
as
iron
almost
sobbing
she
pressed
herself
against
his
breast
holding
him
back
do
do
do
she
whispered
they
could
hear
the
cracking
of
brush
under
the
feet
of
those
who
were
approaching
suddenly
the
sounds
ceased
not
twenty
paces
away
from
his
arms
the
girl
hands
rose
slowly
to
his
shoulders
to
his
face
caressingly
pleadingly
her
beautiful
eyes
glowed
half
with
terror
half
with
a
prayer
to
him
do
she
breathed
again
so
close
that
her
sweet
breath
fell
warm
on
his
face
do
if
you
if
you
care
for
me
gently
he
drew
her
close
in
his
arms
crushing
her
face
to
his
breast
kissing
her
hair
her
eyes
her
mouth
i
love
you
he
whispered
again
and
again
the
steps
were
resumed
the
voices
died
away
then
there
came
a
pressure
against
his
breast
a
gentle
resistance
and
he
opened
his
arms
so
that
the
girl
drew
back
from
him
her
lips
were
smiling
at
him
and
in
that
smile
there
was
gentle
accusation
the
sweetness
of
forgiveness
and
he
could
see
that
with
these
there
had
come
also
a
flush
into
her
cheeks
and
a
dazzling
glow
into
her
eyes
they
are
gone
she
said
tremblingly
yes
they
are
gone
he
stood
looking
down
into
her
glowing
face
in
silence
then
they
are
gone
he
repeated
they
were
the
men
who
tried
to
kill
me
at
prince
albert
i
have
let
them
go
for
you
will
you
tell
me
your
name
yes
that
much
now
it
is
meleese
meleese
the
name
fell
from
him
sharply
in
an
instant
there
recurred
to
him
all
that
croisset
had
said
and
there
almost
came
from
his
lips
the
words
which
had
burned
themselves
in
his
memory
perhaps
you
will
understand
when
i
tell
you
this
warning
is
sent
to
you
by
the
little
meleese
what
had
croisset
meant
meleese
he
repeated
looking
strangely
into
the
girl
face
yes
meleese
she
drew
back
from
him
slowly
the
color
fading
from
her
cheeks
and
as
she
saw
the
light
in
his
eyes
there
burst
from
her
a
short
stifled
cry
now
you
understand
you
understand
why
you
must
go
back
into
the
south
she
almost
sobbed
oh
i
have
sinned
to
tell
you
my
name
but
you
will
go
wo
you
you
will
go
for
me
for
you
i
would
go
to
the
end
of
the
earth
interrupted
howland
his
pale
face
near
to
her
but
you
must
tell
me
why
i
do
understand
you
i
do
know
why
those
men
tried
to
kill
me
in
prince
albert
i
do
know
why
my
life
is
in
danger
here
croisset
told
me
that
my
warning
back
there
came
from
a
girl
named
meleese
i
did
understand
him
i
do
understand
you
it
is
all
a
mystery
to
me
so
far
as
i
know
i
have
never
had
enemies
i
never
heard
your
name
until
croisset
spoke
it
what
did
he
mean
what
do
you
mean
why
do
you
want
to
drive
me
from
the
wekusko
why
is
my
life
in
danger
it
is
for
you
to
tell
me
these
things
i
have
been
honest
with
you
i
love
you
i
will
fight
for
you
if
it
is
necessary
but
you
must
tell
me
tell
me
his
breath
was
hot
in
her
face
and
she
stared
at
him
as
if
what
she
heard
robbed
her
of
the
power
of
speech
wo
you
tell
me
he
whispered
more
softly
meleese
she
made
no
effort
to
resist
him
as
he
drew
her
once
more
in
his
arms
crushing
her
sweet
lips
to
his
own
meleese
wo
you
tell
me
suddenly
she
lifted
her
hands
to
his
face
and
pushed
back
his
head
looking
squarely
into
his
eyes
if
i
tell
you
she
said
softly
and
in
telling
you
i
betray
those
whom
i
love
will
you
promise
to
bring
harm
to
none
of
them
but
go
go
back
into
the
south
and
leave
you
yes
and
leave
me
there
was
the
faintest
tremor
of
a
sob
in
the
voice
which
she
was
trying
so
hard
to
control
his
arms
tightened
about
her
i
will
swear
to
do
what
is
best
for
you
and
for
me
he
replied
i
will
swear
to
bring
harm
to
none
whom
you
care
to
shield
but
i
will
not
promise
to
leave
you
a
soft
glow
came
into
the
girl
eyes
as
she
unclasped
his
arms
and
stood
back
from
him
i
will
think
think
she
whispered
quickly
perhaps
i
will
tell
you
night
here
if
you
will
keep
your
oath
and
do
what
is
best
for
you
and
for
me
i
swear
it
then
i
will
meet
you
here
at
this
time
when
the
others
are
asleep
but
you
will
be
careful
careful
unconsciously
she
half
reached
her
arms
out
to
him
as
she
turned
toward
the
path
you
will
be
careful
promise
me
that
i
promise
like
a
shadow
she
was
gone
he
heard
her
quick
steps
running
up
the
path
saw
her
form
as
it
disappeared
in
the
forest
gloom
for
a
few
moments
longer
he
stood
hardly
breathing
until
he
knew
that
she
had
gone
beyond
his
hearing
then
he
walked
swiftly
along
the
footpath
that
led
to
the
cabin
chapter
vii
the
blowing
of
the
coyote
in
the
new
excitement
that
pulsated
with
every
fiber
of
his
being
howland
forgot
his
own
danger
forgot
his
old
caution
and
the
fears
that
gave
birth
to
it
forgot
everything
in
these
moments
but
meleese
and
his
own
great
happiness
for
he
was
happy
happier
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
happier
than
he
had
ever
expected
to
be
he
was
conscious
of
no
madness
in
this
strange
new
joy
that
swept
through
his
being
like
a
fire
he
did
not
stop
to
weigh
with
himself
the
unreasoning
impulses
that
filled
him
he
had
held
meleese
in
his
arms
he
had
told
her
of
his
love
and
though
she
had
accepted
it
with
gentle
unresponsiveness
he
was
thrilled
by
the
memory
of
that
last
look
in
her
eyes
which
had
spoken
faith
confidence
and
perhaps
even
more
and
his
faith
in
her
had
become
as
limitless
as
the
blue
space
above
him
he
had
known
her
for
but
a
few
hours
and
yet
in
that
time
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
lived
longer
than
in
all
of
the
years
that
had
gone
before
she
had
lied
to
him
had
divulged
only
a
part
of
her
identity
and
yet
he
knew
that
there
were
reasons
for
these
things
night
he
would
see
her
again
and
then
what
would
she
tell
him
whatever
it
was
it
was
to
be
a
reward
for
his
own
love
he
knew
that
by
the
tremble
of
her
voice
the
sobbing
catch
of
her
breath
the
soft
glow
in
her
eyes
impelled
by
that
love
would
she
confide
in
him
and
then
would
he
go
back
into
the
south
he
laughed
softly
joyfully
yes
he
would
go
back
into
the
south
he
would
go
to
the
other
end
of
the
earth
if
she
would
go
with
him
what
was
the
building
of
this
railroad
now
to
that
other
great
thing
that
had
come
into
his
life
for
the
first
time
he
saw
duty
in
another
light
there
were
others
who
could
build
the
road
success
fortune
ambition
in
the
old
way
he
had
seen
them
were
overshadowed
now
by
this
love
of
a
girl
he
stopped
and
lighted
his
pipe
the
fragrant
odor
of
the
tobacco
the
flavor
of
the
warm
smoke
in
his
mouth
helped
to
readjust
him
to
cool
his
heated
brain
the
old
fighting
instincts
leaped
into
life
again
go
into
the
south
he
asked
himself
the
question
once
more
and
in
the
gloomy
silence
of
the
forest
his
low
laugh
fell
again
as
he
clenched
his
hands
in
anticipation
of
what
was
ahead
of
him
no
he
would
build
the
road
and
in
building
it
he
would
win
this
girl
if
it
was
given
for
him
to
possess
her
his
saner
thoughts
brought
back
his
caution
he
went
more
slowly
toward
the
cabin
keeping
in
the
deep
shadows
and
stopping
now
and
then
to
listen
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
he
paused
for
a
long
time
there
was
no
sign
of
life
about
the
cabin
abandoned
by
gregson
and
thorne
it
was
probable
that
the
two
men
who
had
passed
along
the
path
had
returned
to
the
camp
by
another
trail
and
still
keeping
as
much
within
the
shadows
as
possible
he
went
to
the
door
and
entered
with
his
feet
propped
in
front
of
the
big
box
stove
sat
jackpine
the
indian
rose
as
howland
entered
and
something
in
the
sullen
gloom
of
his
face
caused
the
young
engineer
to
eye
him
questioningly
any
one
been
here
jackpine
the
old
gave
his
head
a
negative
shake
and
hunched
his
shoulders
pointing
at
the
same
time
to
the
table
on
which
lay
a
carefully
folded
piece
of
paper
thorne
he
grunted
howland
spread
out
the
paper
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
and
read
my
dear
howland
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
our
mail
sledge
starts
for
le
pas
at
noon
and
as
i
planning
on
going
down
with
it
i
want
you
to
get
over
as
early
as
you
can
in
the
morning
can
put
you
on
to
everything
in
the
camp
between
eight
and
twelve
thorne
a
whistle
of
astonishment
escaped
howland
lips
where
do
you
sleep
jackpine
he
asked
suddenly
cabin
in
edge
of
woods
replied
the
indian
how
about
breakfast
thorne
has
put
me
on
to
the
grub
line
yet
thorne
say
you
eat
with
heem
in
mornin
i
come
early
wake
you
after
heem
go
eat
here
you
need
wake
me
said
howland
throwing
off
his
coat
i
find
thorne
probably
before
he
up
good
night
jackpine
had
half
opened
the
door
and
for
a
moment
the
engineer
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
dark
grinning
face
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
he
hesitated
as
if
about
to
speak
and
then
with
a
mouthful
of
his
inimitable
chuckles
he
went
out
after
bolting
the
door
howland
lighted
a
small
table
lamp
entered
the
sleeping
room
and
prepared
for
bed
got
to
have
a
little
sleep
no
matter
if
things
are
going
off
like
a
fourth
of
july
celebration
he
grumbled
and
rolled
between
the
sheets
in
spite
of
his
old
habit
of
rising
with
the
breaking
of
dawn
it
was
jackpine
who
awakened
him
a
few
hours
later
the
camp
was
hardly
astir
when
he
followed
the
indian
down
among
the
log
cabins
to
quarters
the
senior
engineer
was
already
dressed
sorry
to
hustle
you
so
howland
he
greeted
but
i
got
to
go
down
with
the
mail
just
between
you
and
me
i
do
believe
the
camp
doctor
is
much
on
his
job
i
got
a
deuced
bad
shoulder
and
a
worse
arm
and
i
going
down
to
a
good
surgeon
as
fast
as
i
can
did
they
send
weston
up
with
you
asked
howland
he
knew
that
weston
was
the
best
accident
man
in
the
company
employ
yes
weston
replied
the
senior
eying
him
sharply
i
do
mean
to
say
he
not
a
good
man
howland
he
amended
quickly
but
he
quite
seem
to
take
hold
of
this
hurt
of
mine
by
the
way
i
looked
over
our
and
there
is
no
croisset
on
it
for
an
hour
after
breakfast
the
two
men
were
busy
with
papers
maps
and
drawings
relative
to
the
camp
work
howland
had
kept
in
close
touch
with
operations
from
chicago
and
by
the
time
they
were
ready
to
leave
for
outside
inspection
he
was
confident
that
he
could
take
hold
without
the
personal
assistance
of
either
gregson
or
thorne
before
that
hour
had
passed
he
was
certain
of
at
least
one
other
thing
that
it
was
not
incompetency
that
was
taking
the
two
senior
engineers
back
to
the
home
office
he
had
half
expected
to
find
the
in
the
same
disorganized
condition
as
its
chiefs
but
if
gregson
and
thorne
had
been
laboring
under
a
tremendous
strain
of
some
kind
it
was
not
reflected
in
the
company
work
as
shown
in
the
office
records
which
the
latter
had
spread
out
before
him
that
a
big
six
months
work
said
thorne
when
they
had
finished
good
lord
man
when
we
first
came
up
here
a
could
hop
through
this
place
where
you
sitting
and
now
see
what
we
got
fifty
cabins
four
two
of
the
biggest
warehouses
north
of
winnipeg
a
a
hospital
three
blacksmith
shops
and
a
a
exclaimed
howland
in
genuine
surprise
sure
with
a
ship
half
built
and
frozen
stiff
in
the
ice
you
can
finish
her
in
the
spring
and
you
find
her
mighty
useful
for
bringing
supplies
from
the
head
of
the
wekusko
we
using
horses
on
the
ice
now
had
a
deuced
hard
time
in
getting
fifty
of
up
from
le
pas
and
besides
all
this
we
got
six
miles
of
built
to
the
south
and
three
to
the
north
we
got
a
at
each
but
most
of
the
men
still
prefer
to
come
in
at
night
he
dragged
himself
slowly
and
painfully
to
his
feet
as
a
knock
sounded
at
the
door
that
macdonald
our
camp
superintendent
he
explained
told
him
to
be
here
at
eight
he
a
corker
for
taking
hold
of
things
a
little
wiry
man
hopped
in
as
thorne
threw
open
the
door
the
moment
his
eyes
fell
on
howland
he
sprang
forward
with
outstretched
hand
smiling
and
bobbing
his
head
howland
of
course
he
cried
glad
to
see
you
five
minutes
late
awful
sorry
but
they
having
the
devil
own
time
over
at
a
coyote
we
going
to
blow
this
morning
and
that
what
kept
me
from
howland
he
whirled
on
the
senior
with
the
sudden
movement
of
a
cricket
how
the
arm
thorne
and
if
there
any
mercy
in
your
corpus
tell
me
if
jackpine

me

cigarettes

le
pas

mail

life
as
sure
he
brought
them
said
thorne
but
how
about
this
coyote

thought

was
ready
to
fire
so
it
is
now

south
ridge

scheduled
to
go
up
at
ten

blow
up
the
big
north
mountains
sometime

a
glorious
fireworks
one
hundred
and
barrels
of
powder
and
four
cases
of
dynamite
and
if

far

a
sledge

but
i

to
mac
i
going

with

mail
that
why
i
want
you
with
howland
and
me
this
morning
it
will
be
up
to
you
to
get
him
acquainted
with
every
detail
in
camp
bully
exclaimed
the
little
superintendent
rubbing
his
hands
with
brisk
enthusiasm
greggy
and
thorne
have
done
some
remarkable
things
howland
you
open
your
eyes
when
you
see
talk
about
building
railroads
we
got
all
beat
a
thousand
ways
tearing
through
forests
swamps
and
those
blooming
and
here
we
are
pretty
near
up
at
the
end
of
the
earth
the
new
in
it
with
us
the
ring
off
mac
exclaimed
thorne
and
howland
found
himself
laughing
down
into
the
red
freckled
face
of
the
superintendent
he
liked
this
man
immensely
from
the
first
he
a
bunch
of
live
wires
all
the
time
said
thorne
in
a
low
voice
as
macdonald
went
out
ahead
of
them
always
like
that
happy
as
a
boy
most
of
the
time
loved
by
the
men
but
the
very
devil
himself
when
he
riled
do
know
what
this
camp
would
do
without
him
this
same
thought
occurred
to
howland
a
dozen
times
during
the
next
two
hours
macdonald
seemed
to
be
the
life
and
law
of
the
camp
and
he
wondered
more
and
more
at
thorne
demeanor
the
camp
chiefs
and
gang
foremen
whom
they
met
seemed
to
stand
in
a
certain
awe
of
the
senior
engineer
but
it
was
at
the
little
scotchman
cheery
words
that
their
eyes
lighted
with
enthusiasm
this
was
not
like
the
old
thorne
who
had
been
the
eye
the
ear
and
the
tongue
of
the
greatest
engineering
works
for
a
decade
past
and
whose
boundless
enthusiasm
and
love
of
work
had
been
the
largest
factors
in
the
winning
of
fame
that
was
more
than
national
he
began
to
note
that
there
was
a
strange
nervousness
about
thorne
when
they
were
among
the
men
an
uneasy
alertness
in
his
eyes
as
though
he
were
looking
for
some
particular
face
among
those
they
encountered
macdonald
shrewd
eyes
observed
his
perplexity
and
once
he
took
an
opportunity
to
whisper
i
guess
it
about
time
for
thorne
to
get
back
into
civilization
there
something
bad
in
his
system
weston
told
me
yesterday
that
his
injuries
are
coming
along
finely
i
do
understand
it
a
little
later
they
returned
with
thorne
to
his
room
i
want
howland
to
see
this
south
coyote
go
up
said
macdonald
can
you
spare
him
we
be
back
before
noon
certainly
come
and
take
dinner
with
me
at
twelve
that
will
give
me
time
to
make
memoranda
of
things
i
may
have
forgotten
howland
fancied
that
there
was
a
certain
tone
of
relief
in
the
voice
but
he
made
no
mention
of
it
to
the
superintendent
as
they
walked
swiftly
to
the
scene
of
the
the
coyote
was
ready
for
firing
when
they
arrived
the
coyote
itself
a
tunnel
of
fifty
feet
dug
into
the
solid
rock
of
the
mountain
and
terminating
in
a
chamber
packed
with
explosives
was
closed
by
masses
of
broken
rock
rammed
tight
and
macdonald
showed
his
companion
where
the
electric
wire
passed
to
the
fuse
within
it
a
confounded
mystery
to
me
why
thorne
does
care
to
see
this
ridge
blown
up
he
exclaimed
after
they
had
finished
the
inspection
we
been
at
work
for
three
months
drilling
this
coyote
and
the
bigger
one
to
the
north
there
are
four
thousand
square
yards
of
rock
to
come
out
of
there
and
six
thousand
out
of
the
other
you
do
see
shots
like
those
three
times
in
a
lifetime
and
there
not
be
another
for
us
between
here
and
the
bay
what
the
matter
with
thorne
without
waiting
for
a
reply
macdonald
walked
swiftly
in
the
direction
of
a
ridge
to
the
right
already
guards
had
been
thrown
out
on
all
sides
of
the
mountain
and
their
thrilling
warnings
of
fire
fire
fire
shouted
through
megaphones
of
echoed
with
ominous
meaning
through
the
still
wilderness
where
for
the
time
all
work
had
ceased
on
the
top
of
the
ridge
half
a
hundred
of
the
workmen
had
already
assembled
and
as
howland
and
the
superintendent
came
among
them
they
fell
back
from
around
a
big
flat
boulder
on
which
was
stationed
the
electric
battery
macdonald
face
was
flushed
and
his
eyes
snapped
like
dragonflies
as
he
pointed
to
a
tiny
button
god
but
i
ca
understand
why
thorne
does
care
to
see
this
he
said
again
think
of
it
man
seven
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
of
powder
and
two
hundred
of
dynamite
a
touch
of
this
button
a
flash
along
the
wire
and
the
fuse
is
struck
then
four
or
five
minutes
and
up
goes
a
mountain
that
has
stood
here
since
the
world
began
is
it
glorious
he
straightened
himself
and
took
off
his
hat
howland
will
you
press
the
button
with
a
strange
thrill
howland
bent
over
the
battery
his
eyes
turned
to
the
mass
of
rock
looming
sullen
and
black
half
a
mile
away
as
if
bidding
defiance
in
the
face
of
impending
fate
tremblingly
his
finger
pressed
on
the
little
white
knob
and
a
silence
like
that
of
death
fell
on
those
who
watched
one
minute
two
three
five
passed
while
in
the
bowels
of
the
mountain
the
fuse
was
sizzling
to
its
end
then
there
came
a
puff
something
like
a
cloud
of
dust
rising
skyward
but
without
sound
and
before
its
upward
belching
had
ceased
a
tongue
of
flame
spurted
out
of
its
crest
and
after
that
perhaps
two
seconds
later
came
the
explosion
there
was
a
rumbling
and
a
jarring
as
if
the
earth
were
convulsed
under
foot
volumes
of
dense
black
smoke
shot
upward
shutting
the
mountain
in
an
impenetrable
pall
of
gloom
and
in
an
instant
these
rolling
twisting
volumes
of
black
became
lurid
and
an
explosion
like
that
of
a
thousand
great
guns
rent
the
air
as
fast
as
the
eye
could
follow
sheets
of
flame
shot
out
of
the
sea
of
smoke
climbing
higher
and
higher
in
lightning
flashes
until
the
lurid
tongues
licked
the
air
a
quarter
of
a
mile
above
the
startled
wilderness
explosion
followed
explosion
some
of
them
coming
in
hollow
reverberating
booms
others
sounding
as
if
in
the
heavens
were
filled
with
hurtling
rocks
solid
masses
of
granite
ten
feet
square
were
thrown
a
hundred
feet
away
rocks
weighing
a
ton
were
hurled
still
farther
as
if
they
were
no
more
than
stones
flung
by
the
hand
of
a
giant
chunks
that
would
have
crashed
from
the
roof
to
the
basement
of
a
dropped
a
third
and
nearly
a
half
a
mile
away
for
three
minutes
the
frightful
convulsions
continued
then
the
lurid
lights
died
out
of
the
pall
of
smoke
and
the
pall
itself
began
to
settle
howland
felt
a
grip
on
his
arm
dumbly
he
turned
and
looked
into
the
white
staring
face
of
the
superintendent
his
ears
tingled
every
fiber
in
him
seemed
unstrung
macdonald
voice
came
to
him
strange
and
weird
what
do
you
think
of
that
howland
the
two
men
gripped
hands
and
when
they
looked
again
they
saw
dimly
through
dust
and
smoke
only
torn
and
shattered
masses
of
rock
where
had
been
the
giant
ridge
that
barred
the
path
of
the
new
road
to
the
bay
howland
talked
but
little
on
their
way
back
to
camp
the
scene
that
he
had
just
witnessed
affected
him
strangely
it
stirred
once
more
within
him
all
of
his
old
ambition
all
of
his
old
enthusiasm
and
yet
neither
found
voice
in
words
he
was
glad
when
the
dinner
was
over
at
thorne
and
with
the
going
of
the
mail
sledge
and
the
senior
engineer
there
came
over
him
a
still
deeper
sense
of
joy
now
was
in
charge
it
was
road
from
that
hour
on
he
crushed
macdonald
hand
in
a
grip
that
meant
more
than
words
when
they
parted
in
his
own
cabin
he
threw
off
his
coat
and
hat
lighted
his
pipe
and
tried
to
realize
just
what
this
all
meant
for
him
he
was
in
charge
in
charge
of
the
greatest
railroad
building
job
on
earth
jack
howland
who
less
than
twenty
years
ago
was
a
barefooted
urchin
peddling
papers
in
the
streets
where
he
was
now
famous
and
now
what
was
this
black
thing
that
had
come
up
to
threaten
his
chances
just
as
he
had
about
won
his
great
fight
he
clenched
his
hands
as
he
thought
again
of
what
had
already
happened
the
cowardly
attempt
on
his
life
the
warnings
and
his
blood
boiled
to
fever
heat
that
night
after
he
had
seen
meleese
he
would
know
what
to
do
but
he
would
not
be
driven
away
as
gregson
and
thorne
had
been
driven
he
was
determined
on
that
the
gloom
of
night
falls
early
in
the
great
northern
and
it
was
already
growing
dusk
when
there
came
the
sound
of
a
voice
outside
followed
a
moment
later
by
a
loud
knock
at
the
door
at
invitation
the
door
opened
and
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
man
appeared
something
has
gone
wrong
out
at
the
north
coyote
sir
and
macdonald
wants
you
just
as
fast
as
you
can
get
out
there
he
said
he
sent
me
down
for
you
with
a
sledge
macdonald
told
me
the
thing
was
ready
for
firing
said
howland
putting
on
his
hat
and
coat
what
the
matter
bad
packing
i
guess
heard
him
swearing
about
it
he
in
a
terrible
sweat
to
see
you
half
an
hour
later
the
sledge
drew
up
close
to
the
place
where
howland
had
seen
a
score
of
men
packing
bags
of
powder
and
dynamite
earlier
in
the
day
half
a
dozen
lanterns
were
burning
among
the
rocks
but
there
was
no
sign
of
movement
or
life
the
engineer
companion
gave
a
sudden
sharp
crack
of
his
long
whip
and
in
response
to
it
there
came
a
muffled
halloo
from
out
of
the
gloom
that
macdonald
sir
you
find
him
right
up
there
near
that
second
light
where
the
coyote
opens
up
he
grilling
the
life
out
of
half
a
dozen
men
in
the
chamber
where
he
found
the
dynamite
on
top
of
the
powder
instead
of
under
it
all
right
called
back
howland
starting
up
among
the
rocks
hardly
had
he
taken
a
dozen
steps
when
a
dark
object
shot
out
behind
him
and
fell
with
crushing
force
on
his
head
with
a
groaning
cry
he
fell
forward
on
his
face
for
a
few
moments
he
was
conscious
of
voices
about
him
he
knew
that
he
was
being
lifted
in
the
arms
of
men
and
that
after
a
time
they
were
carrying
him
so
that
his
feet
dragged
on
the
ground
after
that
he
seemed
to
be
sinking
down
down
down
until
he
lost
all
sense
of
existence
in
a
chaos
of
inky
blackness
chapter
viii
the
hour
of
death
a
red
unwinking
eye
staring
at
him
fixedly
from
out
of
impenetrable
gloom
an
ogreish
gleaming
thing
that
brought
life
back
into
him
with
a
thrill
of
horror
was
howland
first
vision
of
returning
consciousness
it
was
dead
in
front
of
him
on
a
level
with
his
face
a
ball
of
yellow
fire
that
seemed
to
burn
into
his
very
soul
he
tried
to
cry
out
but
no
sound
fell
from
his
lips
he
strove
to
move
to
fight
himself
away
but
there
was
no
power
of
movement
in
his
limbs
the
eye
grew
larger
he
saw
that
it
was
so
bright
it
cast
a
halo
and
the
halo
widened
before
his
own
staring
eyes
until
the
dense
gloom
about
it
seemed
to
be
melting
away
then
he
knew
it
was
a
lantern
in
front
of
him
not
more
than
ten
feet
away
consciousness
flooded
him
and
he
made
another
effort
to
cry
out
to
free
his
arms
from
an
invisible
clutch
that
held
him
powerless
at
first
he
thought
this
was
the
clutch
of
human
hands
then
as
the
revealed
more
clearly
the
things
about
him
and
the
outlines
of
his
own
figure
he
saw
that
it
was
a
rope
and
he
knew
that
he
was
unable
to
cry
out
because
of
something
tight
and
suffocating
about
his
mouth
the
truth
came
to
him
swiftly
he
had
come
up
to
the
coyote
on
a
sledge
some
one
had
struck
him
he
remembered
that
men
had
him
over
the
rocks
and
these
men
had
bound
and
gagged
him
and
left
him
here
with
the
lantern
staring
him
in
the
face
but
where
was
he
he
shifted
his
eyes
straining
to
penetrate
the
gloom
ahead
of
him
just
beyond
the
light
there
was
a
black
wall
he
could
not
move
his
head
but
he
saw
where
that
same
wall
closed
in
on
the
left
he
turned
his
gaze
upward
and
it
ended
with
that
same
imprisoning
barrier
of
rock
then
he
looked
down
and
the
cry
of
horror
that
rose
in
his
throat
died
in
a
muffled
groan
the
light
fell
dimly
on
a
sack
two
of
them
three
a
tightly
packed
wall
of
them
he
knew
now
what
had
happened
he
was
imprisoned
in
the
coyote
and
the
sacks
about
him
were
filled
with
powder
he
was
sitting
on
something
hard
a
box
fifty
pounds
of
dynamite
the
cold
sweat
stood
out
in
beads
on
his
face
glistening
in
the
from
between
his
feet
a
thin
white
ghostly
line
ran
out
until
it
lost
itself
in
the
blackness
under
the
lantern
it
was
the
fuse
leading
to
the
box
of
dynamite
on
which
he
was
sitting
madly
he
struggled
at
the
thongs
that
bound
him
until
he
sank
exhausted
against
the
row
of
powder
sacks
at
his
back
like
words
of
fire
the
last
warning
of
meleese
burned
in
his
brain
you
must
go
or
they
will
kill
you
and
this
was
the
way
in
which
he
was
to
die
there
flamed
before
his
eyes
the
terrible
spectacle
which
he
had
witnessed
a
few
hours
before
the
holocaust
of
fire
and
smoke
and
thunder
that
had
disrupted
a
mountain
a
chaos
of
writhing
twisting
fury
and
in
that
moment
his
heart
seemed
to
cease
its
beating
he
closed
his
eyes
and
tried
to
calm
himself
was
it
possible
that
there
lived
men
so
fiendish
as
to
condemn
him
to
this
sort
of
death
why
had
not
his
enemies
killed
him
out
among
the
rocks
that
would
have
been
easier
quicker
less
troublesome
why
did
they
wish
to
torture
him
what
terrible
thing
had
he
done
was
he
mad
mad
and
this
all
a
terrible
nightmare
a
raving
find
unreal
contortion
of
things
in
his
brain
in
this
hour
of
death
question
after
question
raced
through
his
head
and
he
answered
no
one
of
them
he
sat
still
for
a
time
scarcely
breathing
there
was
no
sound
save
the
beating
of
his
own
heart
then
there
came
another
almost
unheard
at
first
faint
thrilling
maddening
tick
tick
tick
it
was
the
beating
of
his
watch
a
spasm
of
horror
seized
him
what
time
was
it
the
coyote
was
to
be
fired
at
nine
it
was
four
when
he
left
his
cabin
how
long
had
he
been
unconscious
was
it
time
now
now
was
macdonald
finger
already
reaching
out
to
that
little
white
button
which
would
send
him
into
eternity
he
struggled
again
gnashing
furiously
at
the
thing
which
covered
his
mouth
tearing
the
flesh
of
his
wrists
as
he
twisted
at
the
ropes
which
bound
him
choking
himself
with
his
efforts
to
loosen
the
thong
about
his
neck
exhausted
again
he
sank
back
panting
half
dead
as
he
lay
with
closed
eyes
a
little
of
his
reason
asserted
itself
after
all
was
he
such
a
coward
as
to
go
mad
tick
tick
tick
his
watch
was
beating
at
a
furious
rate
was
something
wrong
with
it
was
it
going
too
fast
he
tried
to
count
the
seconds
but
they
raced
away
from
him
when
he
looked
again
his
gaze
fell
on
the
little
yellow
tongue
of
flame
in
the
lantern
globe
it
was
not
the
steady
unwinking
eye
of
a
few
minutes
before
there
was
a
sputtering
weakness
about
it
now
and
as
he
watched
the
light
grew
fainter
and
fainter
the
flame
was
going
out
a
few
minutes
more
and
he
would
be
in
darkness
at
first
the
significance
of
it
did
not
come
to
him
then
he
straightened
himself
with
a
jerk
that
tightened
the
thong
about
his
neck
until
it
choked
him
hours
must
have
passed
since
the
lantern
had
been
placed
on
that
rock
else
the
oil
would
not
be
burned
out
of
it
now
for
the
first
time
howland
realized
that
it
was
becoming
more
and
more
difficult
for
him
to
get
breath
the
thing
about
his
neck
was
tightening
slowly
inexorably
like
a
hot
band
of
steel
and
suddenly
because
of
this
tightening
he
found
that
he
had
recovered
his
voice
this
damned
rawhide
is
pinching
my
adam
apple
whatever
had
been
about
his
mouth
had
slipped
down
and
his
words
sounded
hollow
and
choking
in
the
chamber
he
tried
to
raise
his
voice
in
a
shout
though
he
knew
how
futile
his
loudest
shrieks
would
be
the
effort
choked
him
more
his
suffering
was
becoming
excruciating
sharp
pains
darted
like
needles
through
his
limbs
his
back
tortured
him
and
his
head
ached
as
though
a
knife
had
cleft
the
base
of
his
skull
the
strength
of
his
limbs
was
leaving
him
he
no
longer
felt
any
sensation
in
his
cramped
feet
he
measured
the
paralysis
creeping
up
his
legs
inch
by
inch
driving
the
sharp
pains
before
it
and
then
a
groan
of
horror
rose
to
his
lips
the
light
had
gone
out
as
if
that
dying
of
the
little
yellow
flame
were
the
signal
for
his
death
there
came
to
his
ears
a
sharp
hissing
sound
a
spark
leaped
up
into
the
blackness
before
his
eyes
and
a
slow
creeping
glow
came
toward
him
over
the
rock
at
his
feet
the
hour
the
minute
the
second
had
come
and
macdonald
had
pressed
the
little
white
button
that
was
to
send
him
into
eternity
he
did
not
cry
out
now
he
knew
that
the
end
was
very
near
and
in
its
nearness
he
found
new
strength
once
he
had
seen
a
man
walk
to
his
death
on
the
scaffold
and
as
the
condemned
had
spoken
his
last
farewell
with
the
noose
about
his
neck
he
had
marveled
at
the
clearness
of
his
voice
at
the
fearlessness
of
this
creature
in
his
last
moment
on
earth
now
he
understood
inch
by
inch
the
fuse
burned
toward
him
a
fifth
of
the
distance
a
quarter
now
a
third
at
last
it
reached
a
half
was
almost
under
his
feet
two
minutes
more
of
life
he
put
his
whole
strength
once
again
in
an
attempt
to
free
his
hands
this
time
his
attempt
was
cool
steady
masterful
death
one
hundred
seconds
away
his
heart
gave
a
sudden
bursting
leap
into
his
throat
when
he
felt
something
give
another
effort
and
in
the
vault
there
rang
out
a
thrilling
cry
of
triumph
his
hands
were
free
he
reached
forward
to
the
fuse
and
this
time
a
moaning
wordless
sob
fell
from
him
faint
terrifying
with
all
the
horror
that
might
fill
a
human
soul
in
its
inarticulate
note
he
could
not
reach
the
fuse
because
of
the
thong
about
his
neck
he
felt
for
his
knife
he
had
left
it
in
his
room
sixty
seconds
more
forty
thirty
he
could
see
the
fiery
end
of
the
fuse
almost
at
his
feet
suddenly
his
groping
fingers
came
in
contact
with
the
cold
steel
of
his
pocket
revolver
and
with
a
last
hope
he
snatched
it
forth
stretching
down
his
pistol
arm
until
the
muzzle
of
the
weapon
was
within
a
dozen
inches
of
the
deadly
spark
at
his
first
shot
the
spark
leaped
but
did
not
go
out
after
the
second
there
was
no
longer
the
fiery
creeping
thing
on
the
floor
and
crushing
his
head
back
against
the
sacks
howland
sat
for
many
minutes
as
if
death
had
in
reality
come
to
him
in
the
moment
of
his
deliverance
after
a
time
with
tedious
slowness
he
worked
a
hand
into
his
trousers
pocket
where
he
carried
a
it
took
him
a
long
time
to
saw
through
the
rawhide
thong
about
his
neck
after
that
he
cut
the
rope
that
bound
his
ankles
he
made
an
effort
to
rise
but
no
sooner
had
he
gained
his
feet
than
his
paralyzed
limbs
gave
way
under
him
and
he
dropped
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
very
slowly
the
blood
began
finding
its
way
through
his
choked
veins
again
and
with
the
change
there
came
over
him
a
feeling
of
infinite
restfulness
he
stretched
himself
out
with
his
face
turned
to
the
black
wall
above
realizing
only
that
he
was
saved
that
he
had
outwitted
his
mysterious
enemies
again
and
that
he
was
comfortable
he
made
no
effort
to
think
to
scheme
out
his
further
deliverance
he
was
with
the
powder
and
the
dynamite
and
the
powder
and
the
dynamite
could
not
be
exploded
until
human
hands
came
to
attach
a
new
fuse
macdonald
would
attend
to
that
very
soon
so
he
went
off
into
a
doze
that
was
almost
sleep
in
his
there
came
to
him
but
one
sound
that
dreadful
ticking
of
his
watch
he
seemed
to
have
listened
to
it
for
hours
when
there
arose
another
sound
the
ticking
of
another
watch
he
sat
up
startled
wondering
and
then
he
laughed
happily
as
he
heard
the
sound
more
distinctly
it
was
the
beating
of
picks
on
the
rock
outside
already
macdonald
men
were
at
work
clearing
the
mouth
of
the
coyote
in
half
an
hour
he
would
be
out
in
the
big
breathing
world
again
the
thought
brought
him
to
his
feet
the
numbness
was
gone
from
his
limbs
and
he
could
walk
about
his
first
move
was
to
strike
a
match
and
look
at
his
watch
ten
he
spoke
the
words
aloud
thinking
of
meleese
in
an
hour
and
a
half
he
was
to
meet
her
on
the
trail
would
he
be
released
in
time
to
keep
the
tryst
how
should
he
explain
his
imprisonment
in
the
coyote
so
that
he
could
leave
macdonald
without
further
loss
of
time
as
the
sound
of
the
picks
came
nearer
his
brain
began
working
faster
if
he
could
only
evade
explanations
until
morning
and
then
reveal
the
whole
dastardly
business
to
macdonald
there
would
be
time
then
for
those
explanations
for
the
running
down
of
his
murderous
assailants
and
in
the
while
he
would
be
able
to
keep
his
appointment
with
meleese
he
was
not
long
in
finding
a
way
in
which
this
scheme
could
be
worked
and
gathering
up
the
severed
ropes
and
rawhide
he
concealed
them
between
two
of
the
powder
sacks
so
that
those
who
entered
the
coyote
would
discover
no
signs
of
his
terrible
imprisonment
close
to
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
there
was
a
black
rent
in
the
wall
of
rock
made
by
a
bursting
charge
of
dynamite
in
which
he
could
conceal
himself
when
the
men
were
busy
examining
the
broken
fuse
he
would
step
out
and
join
them
it
would
look
as
though
he
had
crawled
through
the
tunnel
after
them
half
an
hour
later
a
mass
of
rock
rolled
down
close
to
his
feet
and
a
few
moments
after
he
saw
a
shadowy
human
form
crawling
through
the
hole
it
had
left
a
second
followed
and
then
a
third
and
the
first
voice
he
heard
was
that
of
macdonald
give
us
the
lantern
bucky
he
called
back
and
a
gleam
of
light
shot
into
the
black
chamber
the
men
walked
cautiously
toward
the
fuse
and
howland
saw
the
little
superintendent
fall
on
his
knees
what
in
hell
he
heard
him
exclaim
and
then
there
was
a
silence
as
quietly
as
a
cat
howland
worked
himself
to
the
entrance
and
made
a
clatter
among
the
rocks
it
was
he
who
responded
to
the
voice
what
up
macdonald
he
coolly
joined
the
little
group
macdonald
looked
up
and
when
he
saw
the
new
chief
bending
over
him
his
eyes
stared
in
unbounded
wonder
howland
he
gasped
it
was
all
he
said
but
in
that
one
word
and
in
the
strange
excitement
in
the
superintendent
face
howland
read
that
which
made
him
turn
quickly
to
the
men
giving
them
his
first
command
as
of
the
road
that
was
going
to
the
bay
get
out
of
the
coyote
boys
he
said
we
wo
do
anything
more
until
morning
to
macdonald
as
the
men
went
out
ahead
of
them
he
added
in
a
low
voice
guard
the
entrance
to
this
tunnel
with
half
a
dozen
of
your
best
men
macdonald
i
know
things
which
will
lead
me
to
investigate
this
i
going
to
leave
you
as
soon
as
i
get
outside
spread
the
report
that
it
was
simply
a
bad
fuse
understand
he
crawled
out
ahead
of
the
superintendent
and
before
macdonald
had
emerged
from
the
coyote
he
had
already
lost
himself
in
the
starlit
gloom
of
the
night
and
was
hastening
to
his
tryst
with
the
beautiful
girl
who
he
believed
would
reveal
to
him
at
least
a
part
of
one
of
the
strangest
and
most
diabolical
plots
that
had
ever
originated
in
the
brain
of
man
chapter
ix
the
tryst
it
still
lacked
nearly
an
hour
of
the
appointed
time
when
howland
came
to
the
secluded
spot
in
the
trail
where
he
was
to
meet
meleese
concealed
in
the
deep
shadows
of
the
bushes
he
seated
himself
on
the
end
of
a
fallen
spruce
and
loaded
his
pipe
taking
care
to
light
it
with
the
flare
of
the
match
hidden
in
the
hollow
of
his
hands
for
the
first
time
since
his
terrible
experience
in
the
coyote
he
found
himself
free
to
think
and
more
than
ever
he
began
to
see
the
necessity
of
coolness
and
of
judgment
in
what
he
was
about
to
do
gradually
too
he
fought
himself
back
into
his
old
faith
in
meleese
his
blood
was
tingling
at
fever
heat
in
his
desire
for
vengeance
for
the
punishment
of
the
human
fiends
who
had
attempted
to
blow
him
to
atoms
and
yet
at
the
same
time
there
was
no
bitterness
in
him
toward
the
girl
he
was
sure
that
she
was
an
unwilling
factor
in
the
plot
and
that
she
was
doing
all
in
her
power
to
save
him
at
the
same
time
he
began
to
realize
that
he
should
no
longer
be
influenced
by
her
pleading
he
had
promised
in
return
for
her
confidence
this
night
to
leave
unpunished
those
whom
she
wished
to
shield
he
would
take
back
that
promise
before
she
revealed
anything
to
him
he
would
warn
her
that
he
was
determined
to
discover
those
who
had
twice
sought
to
kill
him
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
he
looked
at
his
watch
again
was
it
possible
that
meleese
would
not
come
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
that
she
knew
of
his
imprisonment
in
the
coyote
of
this
second
attempt
on
his
life
and
yet
if
she
did
he
rose
from
the
log
and
began
pacing
quickly
back
and
forth
in
the
gloom
his
thoughts
racing
through
his
brain
with
increasing
apprehension
those
who
had
imprisoned
him
had
learned
of
his
escape
an
hour
ago
many
things
might
have
happened
in
that
time
perhaps
they
were
fleeing
from
the
camp
frightened
by
their
failure
and
fearing
the
punishment
which
would
be
theirs
if
discovered
it
was
not
improbable
that
even
now
they
were
many
miles
from
the
wekusko
hurrying
deeper
into
the
unknown
wilderness
to
the
north
and
meleese
would
be
with
them
suddenly
he
heard
a
step
a
light
running
step
and
with
a
recognizing
cry
he
sprang
out
into
the
starlight
to
meet
the
slim
panting
figure
that
ran
to
him
from
between
the
thick
walls
of
forest
trees
meleese
he
exclaimed
softly
he
held
out
his
arms
and
the
girl
ran
straight
into
them
thrusting
her
hands
against
his
breast
throwing
back
her
head
so
that
she
looked
up
into
his
face
with
great
staring
eyes
now
now
she
sobbed
will
you
go
her
hands
left
his
breast
and
crept
to
his
shoulders
slowly
they
slipped
over
them
and
as
howland
pressed
her
closer
his
lips
silent
she
gave
an
agonized
cry
and
dropped
her
head
against
his
shoulder
her
whole
body
torn
in
a
convulsion
of
grief
and
terror
that
startled
him
you
will
go
she
sobbed
again
and
again
you
will
go
you
will
go
he
ran
his
fingers
through
her
soft
hair
crushing
his
face
close
to
hers
no
i
am
not
going
dear
he
replied
in
a
low
firm
voice
not
after
what
happened
she
drew
away
from
him
as
quickly
as
if
he
had
struck
her
freeing
herself
even
from
the
touch
of
his
hands
i
heard
what
happened
an
hour
ago
she
said
her
voice
choking
her
i
overheard
them
talking
she
struggled
hard
to
control
herself
you
must
leave
the
camp
in
the
gloom
she
saw
howland
teeth
gleaming
there
was
no
fear
in
his
smile
he
laughed
gently
down
into
her
eyes
as
he
took
her
face
between
his
hands
again
i
want
to
take
back
the
promise
that
i
gave
you
last
night
meleese
i
want
to
give
you
a
chance
to
warn
any
whom
you
may
wish
to
warn
i
shall
not
return
into
the
south
from
this
hour
begins
the
hunt
for
the
cowardly
devils
who
have
tried
to
murder
me
before
dawn
every
man
on
the
wekusko
will
be
in
the
search
and
if
we
find
them
there
shall
be
no
mercy
will
you
help
me
or
she
struck
his
hands
from
her
face
springing
back
before
he
had
finished
he
saw
a
sudden
change
of
expression
her
lips
grew
tense
and
firm
from
the
death
whiteness
of
her
face
there
faded
slowly
away
the
look
of
soft
pleading
the
quivering
lines
of
fear
there
was
a
strangeness
in
her
voice
when
she
spoke
something
of
the
hard
determination
which
howland
had
put
in
his
own
and
yet
the
tone
of
it
lacked
his
gentleness
and
love
will
you
please
tell
me
the
time
the
question
was
almost
startling
howland
held
the
dial
of
his
watch
to
the
light
of
the
stars
it
is
a
quarter
past
midnight
the
faintest
shadow
of
a
smile
passed
over
the
girl
lips
are
you
certain
that
your
watch
is
not
fast
she
asked
in
speechless
bewilderment
howland
stared
at
her
because
it
will
mean
a
great
deal
to
you
and
to
me
if
it
is
not
a
quarter
past
midnight
continued
meleese
a
growing
glow
in
her
eyes
suddenly
she
approached
him
and
put
both
of
her
warm
hands
to
his
face
holding
down
his
arms
with
her
own
listen
she
whispered
is
there
nothing
nothing
that
will
make
you
change
your
purpose
that
will
take
you
back
into
the
south
the
nearness
of
the
sweet
face
the
gentle
touch
of
the
girl
hands
the
soft
breath
of
her
lips
sent
a
maddening
impulse
through
howland
to
surrender
everything
to
her
for
an
instant
he
wavered
there
might
be
one
just
thing
that
would
take
me
away
he
replied
his
voice
trembling
with
the
great
love
that
thrilled
him
for
you
meleese
i
would
give
up
everything
ambition
fortune
the
building
of
this
road
if
i
go
will
you
go
with
me
will
you
promise
to
be
my
wife
when
we
reach
le
pas
a
look
of
ineffable
tenderness
came
into
the
beautiful
eyes
so
near
to
his
own
that
is
impossible
you
will
not
love
me
when
you
know
what
i
am
what
i
have
done
he
stopped
her
have
you
done
wrong
a
great
wrong
for
a
moment
her
eyes
faltered
then
hesitatingly
there
fell
from
her
lips
i
do
know
i
believe
i
have
but
it
not
that
not
do
you
mean
that
that
i
have
no
right
to
tell
you
i
love
you
he
asked
do
you
mean
that
it
is
wrong
for
you
to
listen
to
me
i
i
took
it
for
granted
that
you
were
a
girl
that
no
no
it
is
not
that
she
cried
quickly
catching
his
meaning
it
is
not
wrong
for
you
to
love
me
suddenly
she
asked
again
will
you
please
tell
me
what
time
it
is
now
he
looked
again
minutes
after
midnight
let
us
go
farther
up
the
trail
she
whispered
i
am
afraid
here
she
led
the
way
passing
swiftly
beyond
the
path
that
branched
out
to
his
cabin
two
hundred
yards
beyond
this
a
tree
had
fallen
on
the
edge
of
the
trail
and
seating
herself
on
it
meleese
motioned
for
him
to
sit
down
beside
her
howland
back
was
to
the
thick
bushes
behind
them
he
looked
at
the
girl
but
she
had
turned
away
her
face
suddenly
she
sprang
from
the
log
and
stood
in
front
of
him
now
she
cried
now
and
at
that
signal
howland
arms
were
seized
from
behind
and
in
another
instant
he
was
struggling
feebly
in
the
grip
of
powerful
arms
which
had
fastened
themselves
about
him
like
wire
cable
and
the
cry
that
rose
to
his
lips
was
throttled
by
a
hand
over
his
mouth
for
an
instant
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
girl
white
face
as
she
stood
in
the
trail
then
strong
hands
pulled
him
back
while
others
bound
his
wrists
and
still
others
held
his
legs
everything
had
passed
in
a
few
seconds
helplessly
bound
and
gagged
he
lay
on
his
back
in
the
snow
listening
to
the
low
voices
that
came
faintly
to
him
from
beyond
the
bushes
he
could
understand
nothing
that
they
said
and
yet
he
was
sure
that
he
recognized
among
them
the
voice
of
meleese
the
voices
became
fainter
he
heard
retreating
footsteps
and
at
last
they
died
away
entirely
through
a
rift
in
the
trees
straight
above
him
the
white
cold
stars
of
the
night
gleamed
down
on
him
and
howland
stared
up
at
them
fixedly
until
they
seemed
to
be
hopping
and
dancing
about
in
the
skies
he
wanted
to
swear
yell
fight
in
these
moments
that
he
lay
on
his
back
in
the
freezing
snow
a
million
demons
were
born
in
his
blood
the
girl
had
betrayed
him
again
this
time
he
could
find
no
excuse
no
pardon
for
her
she
had
accepted
his
love
had
allowed
him
to
kiss
her
to
hold
her
in
his
arms
while
beneath
that
hypocrisy
she
had
plotted
his
downfall
a
second
time
deliberately
she
had
given
the
signal
for
attack
and
now
he
heard
again
the
quick
running
step
that
he
had
recognized
on
the
trail
the
bushes
behind
him
parted
and
in
the
white
starlight
meleese
fell
on
her
knees
at
his
side
her
glorious
face
bending
over
him
in
a
grief
that
he
had
never
seen
in
it
before
her
eyes
shining
on
him
with
a
great
love
without
speaking
she
lifted
his
head
in
the
hollow
of
her
arm
and
crushed
her
own
down
against
it
kissing
him
and
softly
sobbing
his
name
he
heard
her
breathe
he
struggled
to
cry
out
as
she
lowered
his
head
back
on
the
snow
to
free
his
hands
to
hold
her
with
him
but
he
saw
her
face
only
once
more
bending
over
him
felt
the
warm
pressure
of
her
lips
to
his
forehead
and
then
again
he
could
hear
her
footsteps
hurrying
away
through
the
forest
chapter
x
a
race
into
the
north
that
meleese
loved
him
that
she
had
taken
his
head
in
her
arms
and
had
kissed
him
was
the
one
consuming
thought
in
howland
brain
for
many
minutes
after
she
had
left
him
bound
and
gagged
on
the
snow
that
she
had
made
no
effort
to
free
him
did
not
at
first
strike
him
as
significant
he
still
felt
the
sweet
warm
touch
of
her
lips
the
pressure
of
her
arms
the
smothering
softness
of
her
hair
it
was
not
until
he
again
heard
approaching
sounds
that
he
returned
once
more
to
a
full
consciousness
of
the
mysterious
thing
that
had
happened
he
heard
first
of
all
the
creaking
of
a
toboggan
on
the
hard
crust
then
the
pattering
of
dogs
feet
and
after
that
the
voices
of
men
the
sounds
stopped
on
the
trail
a
dozen
feet
away
from
him
with
a
strange
thrill
he
recognized
croisset
voice
you
must
be
sure
that
you
make
no
mistake
he
heard
the
say
go
to
the
waterfall
at
the
head
of
the
lake
and
heave
down
a
big
rock
where
the
ice
is
open
and
the
water
boiling
track
up
the
snow
with
a
pair
of
howland
boots
and
leave
his
hat
tangled
in
the
bushes
then
tell
the
superintendent
that
he
stepped
on
the
stone
and
that
it
rolled
down
and
toppled
him
into
the
chasm
they
could
never
find
his
body
and
they
will
send
down
for
a
new
engineer
in
place
of
the
lost
stupefied
with
horror
howland
strained
his
ears
to
catch
the
rest
of
the
scheme
which
he
was
overhearing
but
the
voices
grew
lower
and
he
understood
no
more
that
was
said
until
croisset
coming
nearer
called
out
help
me
with
the
before
you
go
jackpine
he
is
a
dead
weight
with
all
those
rawhides
about
him
as
coolly
as
though
he
were
not
more
than
a
chunk
of
stovewood
croisset
and
the
indian
came
through
the
bushes
seized
him
by
the
head
and
feet
carried
him
out
into
the
trail
and
laid
him
lengthwise
on
the
sledge
i
hope
you
have
not
caught
cold
lying
in
the
snow
said
croisset
bolstering
up
the
engineer
head
and
shoulders
and
covering
him
with
heavy
furs
we
should
have
been
back
sooner
but
it
was
impossible
woonga
he
called
softly
to
his
get
up
there
you
as
the
sledge
started
with
croisset
running
close
to
the
leader
howland
heard
the
low
snapping
of
a
whip
behind
him
and
another
voice
urging
on
other
dogs
with
an
effort
that
almost
dislocated
his
neck
he
twisted
himself
so
he
could
look
back
of
him
a
hundred
yards
away
he
discerned
a
second
team
following
in
his
trail
he
saw
a
shadowy
figure
running
at
the
head
of
the
dogs
but
what
there
was
on
the
sledge
or
what
it
meant
he
could
not
see
or
surmise
mile
after
mile
the
two
sledges
continued
without
a
stop
croisset
did
not
turn
his
head
no
word
fell
from
his
lips
except
an
occasional
signal
to
the
dogs
the
trail
had
turned
now
straight
into
the
north
and
soon
howland
could
make
out
no
sign
of
it
but
knew
only
that
they
were
twisting
through
the
most
open
places
in
the
forests
and
that
the
play
of
the
polar
lights
was
never
over
his
left
shoulder
or
his
right
but
always
in
his
face
they
had
traveled
for
several
hours
when
croisset
gave
a
sudden
shrill
shout
to
the
rearmost
sledge
and
halted
his
own
the
dogs
fell
in
a
panting
group
on
the
snow
and
while
they
were
resting
the
relieved
his
prisoner
of
the
soft
buckskin
that
had
been
used
as
a
gag
it
will
be
perfectly
safe
for
you
to
talk
now
and
to
shout
as
loudly
as
you
please
he
said
after
i
have
looked
into
your
pockets
i
will
free
your
hands
so
that
you
can
smoke
are
you
comfortable
comfortable
be
damned
were
the
first
words
that
fell
from
lips
and
his
blood
boiled
at
the
sociable
way
in
which
croisset
grinned
down
into
his
face
so
you
in
it
too
eh
and
that
lying
girl
the
smile
left
croisset
face
do
you
mean
meleese
howland
yes
croisset
leaned
down
with
his
black
eyes
gleaming
like
coals
do
you
know
what
i
would
do
if
i
was
her
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
yet
one
filled
with
a
threat
which
stilled
the
words
of
passion
which
the
engineer
was
on
the
point
of
uttering
do
you
know
what
i
would
do
i
would
kill
you
kill
you
inch
by
inch
torture
you
that
is
what
i
would
do
for
god
sake
croisset
tell
me
why
why
croisset
had
found
howland
pistol
and
freed
his
hands
and
the
engineer
stretched
them
out
entreatingly
i
would
give
my
life
for
that
girl
croisset
i
told
her
so
back
there
and
she
came
to
me
when
i
was
in
the
snow
and
he
caught
himself
adding
to
what
he
had
left
incomplete
there
is
a
mistake
croisset
i
am
not
the
man
they
want
to
kill
croisset
was
smiling
at
him
again
smoke
and
think
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
tell
you
why
you
should
be
dead
but
you
ought
to
know
unless
your
memory
is
shorter
than
a
child
he
went
to
the
dogs
stirring
them
up
with
the
cracking
of
his
whip
and
when
howland
turned
to
look
back
he
saw
a
bright
flare
of
light
where
the
other
sledge
had
stopped
a
man
voice
came
from
the
farther
gloom
calling
to
croisset
in
french
he
tells
me
i
am
to
take
you
on
alone
said
croisset
after
he
had
replied
to
the
words
spoken
in
a
patois
which
howland
could
not
understand
they
will
join
us
again
very
soon
they
exclaimed
howland
how
many
will
it
take
to
kill
me
my
dear
croisset
the
smiled
down
into
his
face
again
you
may
thank
the
blessed
virgin
that
they
are
with
us
he
replied
softly
if
you
have
any
hope
outside
of
heaven
it
is
on
that
sledge
behind
as
he
went
again
to
the
dogs
straightening
the
leader
in
his
traces
howland
stared
back
at
the
firelit
space
in
the
forest
gloom
he
could
see
a
man
adding
fuel
to
the
blaze
and
beyond
him
shrouded
in
the
deep
shadows
of
the
trees
an
indistinct
tangle
of
dogs
and
sledge
as
he
strained
his
eyes
to
discover
more
there
was
a
movement
beyond
the
figure
over
the
fire
and
the
young
engineer
heart
leaped
with
a
sudden
thrill
croisset
voice
sounded
in
a
shrill
shout
behind
him
and
at
that
warning
cry
in
french
the
second
figure
sprang
back
into
the
gloom
but
howland
had
recognized
it
and
the
chilled
blood
in
his
veins
leaped
into
warm
life
again
at
the
knowledge
that
it
was
meleese
who
was
trailing
behind
them
on
the
second
sledge
when
you
yell
like
that
give
me
a
little
warning
if
you
please
jean
he
said
speaking
as
coolly
as
though
he
had
not
recognized
the
figure
that
had
come
for
an
instant
into
the
firelight
it
is
enough
to
startle
the
life
out
of
one
it
is
our
way
of
saying
replied
croisset
with
a
fierce
snap
of
his
whip
get
along
there
he
cried
to
the
dogs
and
in
half
a
dozen
breaths
the
fire
was
lost
to
view
dawn
comes
at
about
eight
in
the
northern
beyond
the
fiftieth
degree
the
first
ruddy
haze
of
the
sun
begins
to
warm
the
southeastern
skies
at
nine
and
its
glow
had
already
risen
above
the
forests
before
croisset
stopped
his
team
again
for
two
hours
he
had
not
spoken
a
word
to
his
prisoner
and
after
several
unavailing
efforts
to
break
the
other
taciturnity
howland
lapsed
into
a
silence
of
his
own
when
he
had
brought
his
tired
dogs
to
a
halt
croisset
spoke
for
the
first
time
we
are
going
to
camp
here
for
a
few
hours
he
explained
if
you
will
pledge
me
your
word
of
honor
that
you
will
make
no
attempt
to
escape
i
will
give
you
the
use
of
your
legs
until
after
breakfast
what
do
you
say
have
you
a
bible
croisset
no
but
i
have
the
cross
of
our
virgin
given
to
me
by
the
missioner
at
york
factory
then
i
will
swear
by
it
i
will
swear
by
all
the
crosses
and
all
the
bibles
in
the
world
that
i
will
make
no
effort
to
escape
i
am
paralyzed
croisset
i
could
run
for
a
week
croisset
was
searching
in
his
pockets
dieu
he
cried
excitedly
i
have
lost
it
ah
come
to
think
i
gave
the
cross
to
my
mariane
before
i
went
into
the
south
but
i
will
take
your
word
and
who
is
mariane
jean
will
she
also
be
in
at
the
mariane
is
my
wife
ah
mariane
the
daughter
of
an
indian
princess
and
the
granddaughter
of
a
de
could
there
be
better
than
that
and
she
is
with
hair
like
the
top
side
of
a
raven
wing
with
the
sun
shining
on
it
and
you
love
her
a
great
deal
jean
next
to
the
virgin
and
it
may
be
a
little
better
croisset
had
severed
the
rope
about
the
engineer
legs
and
as
he
raised
his
glowing
eyes
howland
reached
out
and
put
both
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
in
just
that
way
i
love
meleese
he
said
softly
jean
wo
you
be
my
friend
i
do
want
to
escape
i
not
a
coward
wo
you
think
of
what
your
mariane
might
do
and
be
a
friend
to
me
you
would
die
for
mariane
if
it
were
necessary
and
i
would
die
for
the
girl
back
on
that
sledge
he
had
staggered
to
his
feet
and
pointed
into
the
forests
through
which
they
had
come
i
saw
her
in
the
firelight
jean
why
is
she
following
us
why
do
they
want
to
kill
me
if
you
would
only
give
me
a
chance
to
prove
that
it
is
all
a
mistake
that
i
croisset
reached
out
and
took
his
hand
i
would
like
to
help
you
he
interrupted
i
liked
you
that
night
we
came
in
together
from
the
fight
on
the
trail
i
have
liked
you
since
and
yet
if
i
was
in
place
i
would
kill
you
even
though
i
like
you
it
is
a
great
duty
to
kill
you
they
did
not
do
wrong
when
they
tied
you
in
the
coyote
they
did
not
do
wrong
when
they
tried
to
kill
you
on
the
trail
but
i
have
taken
a
solemn
oath
to
tell
you
nothing
nothing
beyond
this
that
so
long
as
you
are
with
me
and
that
sledge
is
behind
us
your
life
is
not
in
danger
i
will
tell
you
nothing
more
are
you
hungry
starved
said
howland
he
stumbled
a
few
steps
out
into
the
snow
the
numbness
in
his
limbs
forcing
him
to
catch
at
trees
and
saplings
to
save
himself
from
falling
he
was
astonished
at
croisset
words
and
more
confused
than
ever
at
the
assurance
that
his
life
was
no
longer
in
immediate
peril
to
him
this
meant
that
meleese
had
not
only
warned
him
but
was
now
playing
an
active
part
in
preserving
his
life
and
this
conclusion
added
to
his
perplexity
who
was
this
girl
who
a
few
hours
before
had
deliberately
lured
him
among
his
enemies
and
who
was
now
fighting
to
save
him
the
question
held
a
deeper
significance
for
him
than
when
he
had
asked
himself
this
same
thing
at
prince
albert
and
when
croisset
called
for
him
to
return
to
the
and
breakfast
he
touched
once
more
the
forbidden
subject
jean
i
do
want
to
hurt
your
feelings
he
said
seating
himself
on
the
sledge
but
i
got
to
get
a
few
things
out
of
my
system
i
believe
this
meleese
of
yours
is
a
bad
woman
like
a
flash
croisset
struck
at
the
bait
which
howland
threw
out
to
him
he
leaned
a
little
forward
a
hand
quivering
on
his
knife
his
eyes
flashing
fire
involuntarily
the
engineer
recoiled
from
that
crouch
from
the
black
rage
which
was
growing
each
instant
in
the
face
yet
croisset
spoke
softly
and
without
excitement
even
while
his
shoulders
and
arms
were
twitching
like
a
forest
cat
about
to
spring
no
one
in
the
world
must
say
that
about
my
mariane
and
next
to
her
they
must
not
say
it
about
meleese
up
there
and
he
pointed
still
farther
into
the
north
i
know
of
a
hundred
men
between
the
athabasca
and
the
bay
who
would
kill
you
for
what
you
have
said
and
it
is
not
for
jean
croisset
to
listen
to
it
here
i
will
kill
you
unless
you
take
it
back
god
breathed
howland
he
looked
straight
into
croisset
face
glad
it
so
jean
he
added
slowly
do
you
understand
man
i
love
her
i
did
mean
what
i
said
i
would
kill
for
her
too
jean
i
said
that
to
find
out
what
you
would
do
slowly
croisset
relaxed
a
faint
smile
curling
his
thin
lips
if
it
was
a
joke
it
was
a
bad
one
it
was
a
joke
cried
howland
it
was
a
serious
effort
to
make
you
tell
me
something
about
meleese
listen
jean
she
told
me
back
there
that
it
was
not
wrong
for
me
to
love
her
and
when
i
lay
bound
and
gagged
in
the
snow
she
came
to
me
and
and
kissed
me
i
understand
croisset
interrupted
him
did
she
do
that
i
swear
it
then
you
are
fortunate
smiled
jean
softly
for
i
will
stake
my
hope
in
the
blessed
hereafter
that
she
has
never
done
that
to
another
man
but
it
will
never
happen
again
i
believe
that
it
will
unless
you
kill
me
and
i
shall
not
hesitate
to
kill
you
if
i
think
that
it
is
likely
to
happen
again
there
are
others
who
would
kill
you
knowing
that
it
has
happened
but
once
but
you
must
stop
this
talk
if
you
persist
i
shall
put
the
rawhide
over
your
mouth
again
and
if
i
object
fight
you
have
given
me
your
word
of
honor
up
here
in
the
big
snows
the
keeping
of
that
word
is
our
first
law
if
you
break
it
i
will
kill
you
good
lord
but
you
a
cheerful
companion
exclaimed
howland
laughing
in
spite
of
himself
do
you
know
croisset
this
whole
situation
has
a
good
deal
of
humor
as
well
as
tragedy
about
it
i
must
be
a
most
important
cuss
whoever
i
am
ask
me
who
i
am
croisset
and
who
are
you
i
do
know
jean
fact
i
do
i
used
to
think
that
i
was
a
most
ambitious
young
cub
in
a
big
engineering
establishment
down
in
chicago
but
i
guess
i
was
dreaming
funny
dream
was
it
thought
i
came
up
here
to
build
a
road
somewhere
through
these
infernal
i
mean
these
beautiful
snows
but
my
mind
must
have
been
wandering
again
ever
hear
of
an
insane
asylum
croisset
am
i
in
a
big
stone
building
with
iron
bars
at
the
windows
and
are
you
my
keeper
just
come
in
to
amuse
me
for
a
time
it
kind
of
you
croisset
and
i
hope
that
some
day
i
shall
get
my
mind
back
so
that
i
can
thank
you
decently
perhaps
you
go
mad
some
day
jean
and
dream
about
pretty
girls
and
railroads
and
forests
and
snows
and
then
i
be
your
keeper
have
a
cigar
i
got
just
two
left
dieu
gasped
jean
yes
i
will
smoke
is
that
moose
steak
good
fine
i
have
eaten
a
mouthful
since
years
ago
when
i
dreamed
that
i
sat
on
a
case
of
dynamite
just
about
to
blow
up
did
you
ever
sit
on
a
case
of
dynamite
just
about
to
blow
up
jean
no
it
must
be
unpleasant
that
dream
was
what
turned
my
hair
white
jean
see
how
white
it
is
whiter
than
the
snow
croisset
looked
at
him
a
little
anxiously
as
he
ate
his
meat
and
at
the
gathering
unrest
in
his
ayes
howland
burst
into
a
laugh
do
be
frightened
jean
he
spoke
soothingly
i
harmless
but
i
promise
you
that
i
become
violent
unless
something
reasonable
occurs
pretty
soon
hello
are
you
going
to
start
so
soon
right
away
said
croisset
who
was
stirring
up
the
dogs
will
you
walk
and
run
or
ride
walk
and
run
with
your
permission
you
have
it
but
if
you
attempt
to
escape
i
must
shoot
you
run
on
the
right
of
the
dogs
even
with
me
i
will
take
this
side
until
croisset
stopped
again
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
howland
watched
the
backward
trail
for
the
appearance
of
the
second
sledge
but
there
was
no
sign
of
it
once
he
ventured
to
bring
up
the
subject
to
croisset
who
did
no
more
than
reply
with
a
hunch
of
his
shoulders
and
a
quick
look
which
warned
the
engineer
to
keep
his
silence
after
their
second
meal
the
journey
was
resumed
and
by
referring
occasionally
to
his
compass
howland
observed
that
the
trail
was
swinging
gradually
to
the
eastward
long
before
dusk
exhaustion
compelled
him
to
ride
once
more
on
the
sledge
croisset
seemed
tireless
and
under
the
early
glow
of
the
stars
and
the
red
moon
he
still
led
on
the
worn
pack
until
at
last
it
stopped
on
the
summit
of
a
mountainous
ridge
with
a
vast
plain
stretching
into
the
north
as
far
as
the
eyes
could
see
through
the
white
gloom
the
came
back
to
where
howland
was
seated
on
the
sledge
we
are
going
but
a
little
farther
he
said
i
must
replace
the
rawhide
over
your
mouth
and
the
thongs
about
your
wrists
i
am
sorry
but
i
will
leave
your
legs
free
thanks
said
howland
but
really
it
is
unnecessary
croisset
i
am
properly
subdued
to
the
fact
that
fate
is
determined
to
play
out
this
interesting
game
of
ball
with
me
and
no
longer
knowing
where
i
am
i
promise
you
to
do
nothing
more
exciting
than
smoke
my
pipe
if
you
will
allow
me
to
go
along
peaceably
at
your
side
croisset
hesitated
you
will
not
attempt
to
escape
and
you
will
hold
your
tongue
he
asked
yes
jean
drew
forth
his
revolver
and
deliberately
cocked
it
bear
in
mind
that
i
will
kill
you
if
you
break
your
word
you
may
go
ahead
and
he
pointed
down
the
side
of
the
mountain
chapter
xi
the
house
of
the
red
death
down
the
ridge
a
low
word
from
croisset
stopped
the
engineer
jean
had
toggled
his
team
with
a
stout
length
of
babeesh
on
the
mountain
top
and
he
was
looking
back
when
howland
turned
toward
him
the
sharp
edge
of
that
part
of
the
mountain
from
which
they
were
descending
stood
out
in
a
line
against
the
sky
and
on
this
edge
the
six
dogs
of
the
team
sat
squat
on
their
haunches
silent
and
motionless
like
strangely
carved
gargoyles
placed
there
to
guard
the
limitless
plains
below
howland
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
as
he
watched
the
staring
interest
of
croisset
from
the
man
he
looked
up
again
at
the
dogs
there
was
something
in
their
attitude
in
the
moveless
reaching
of
their
muzzles
out
into
the
wonderful
starlit
mystery
of
the
still
night
that
filled
him
with
an
indefinable
sense
of
awe
then
there
came
to
his
ears
the
sound
that
had
stopped
croisset
a
low
moaning
whine
which
seemed
to
have
neither
beginning
nor
end
but
which
was
borne
in
on
his
senses
as
though
it
were
a
part
of
the
soft
movement
of
the
air
he
breathed
a
note
of
infinite
sadness
which
held
him
startled
and
without
movement
as
it
held
jean
croisset
and
just
as
he
thought
that
the
thing
had
died
away
the
wailing
came
again
rising
higher
and
higher
until
at
last
there
rose
over
him
a
single
long
howl
that
chilled
the
blood
to
his
very
marrow
it
was
like
the
of
that
first
night
he
had
looked
on
the
wilderness
and
yet
unlike
it
in
the
first
it
had
been
the
cry
of
the
savage
of
hunger
of
the
unending
desolation
of
life
that
had
thrilled
him
in
this
it
was
death
he
stood
shivering
as
croisset
came
down
to
him
his
thin
face
shining
white
in
the
starlight
there
was
no
other
sound
save
the
excited
beating
of
life
in
their
own
bodies
when
jean
spoke
our
dogs
howl
like
that
only
when
some
one
is
dead
or
about
to
die
he
whispered
it
was
woonga
who
gave
the
cry
he
has
lived
for
eleven
years
and
i
have
never
known
him
to
fail
there
was
an
uneasy
gleam
in
his
eyes
i
must
tie
your
hands
but
i
have
given
you
my
word
jean
your
hands
there
is
already
death
below
us
in
the
plain
or
it
is
to
come
very
soon
i
must
tie
your
hands
howland
thrust
his
wrists
behind
him
and
about
them
jean
twisted
a
thong
of
babeesh
i
believe
i
understand
he
spoke
softly
listening
again
for
the
chilling
wail
from
the
mountain
top
you
are
afraid
that
i
will
kill
you
it
is
a
warning
you
might
try
but
i
should
probably
kill
you
as
it
is
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
he
led
the
way
down
the
ridge
as
it
is
there
is
small
chance
of
jean
croisset
answering
the
call
may
those
saints
of
yours
preserve
me
jean
but
this
is
all
very
cheerful
grunted
howland
half
laughing
in
spite
of
himself
now
that
i
tied
up
again
who
the
devil
is
there
to
die
but
me
that
is
a
hard
question
replied
the
with
grim
seriousness
perhaps
it
is
your
turn
i
half
believe
that
it
is
scarcely
were
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
when
there
came
again
the
moaning
howl
from
the
top
of
the
ridge
you
getting
on
my
nerves
jean
you
and
that
accursed
dog
silence
out
of
the
grim
loneliness
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
there
loomed
a
shadow
which
at
first
howland
took
to
be
a
huge
mass
of
rock
a
few
steps
farther
and
he
saw
that
it
was
a
building
croisset
gripped
him
firmly
by
the
arm
stay
here
he
commanded
i
will
return
soon
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
howland
waited
twice
in
that
interval
the
dog
howled
above
him
he
was
glad
when
croisset
appeared
out
of
the
gloom
it
is
as
i
thought
there
is
death
down
here
come
with
me
the
shadow
of
the
big
building
shrouded
them
as
they
approached
howland
could
make
out
that
it
was
built
of
massive
logs
and
that
there
seemed
to
be
neither
door
nor
window
on
their
side
and
yet
when
jean
hesitated
for
an
instant
before
a
blotch
of
gloom
that
was
deeper
than
the
others
he
knew
that
they
had
come
to
an
entrance
croisset
advanced
softly
sniffing
the
air
suspiciously
with
his
thin
nostrils
and
listening
with
howland
so
close
to
him
that
their
shoulders
touched
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
there
came
again
the
mournful
of
old
woonga
and
jean
shivered
howland
stared
into
the
blotch
of
gloom
and
still
staring
he
followed
croisset
entered
and
disappeared
in
it
about
them
was
the
stillness
and
the
damp
smell
of
desertion
there
was
no
visible
sign
of
life
no
breathing
no
movement
but
their
own
and
yet
howland
could
feel
the
hand
clutch
him
nervously
by
the
arm
as
they
went
step
by
step
into
the
black
and
silent
mystery
of
the
place
soon
there
came
a
fumbling
of
croisset
hand
at
a
latch
and
they
passed
through
a
second
door
then
jean
struck
a
match
half
a
dozen
steps
away
was
a
table
and
on
the
table
a
lamp
croisset
lighted
it
and
with
a
quiet
laugh
faced
the
engineer
they
were
in
a
low
chamber
without
a
window
and
with
but
the
one
door
through
which
they
had
entered
the
table
two
chairs
a
stove
and
a
bunk
built
against
one
of
the
log
walls
were
all
that
howland
could
see
but
it
was
not
the
barrenness
of
what
he
imagined
was
to
be
his
new
prison
that
held
his
eyes
in
staring
inquiry
on
croisset
it
was
the
look
in
his
companion
face
the
yellow
pallor
of
fear
a
horror
that
had
taken
possession
of
it
the
closed
and
bolted
the
door
and
then
sat
down
beside
the
table
his
thin
face
peering
up
through
the
sickly
at
the
engineer
it
would
be
hard
for
you
to
guess
where
you
are
howland
waited
if
you
had
lived
in
this
country
long
you
would
have
heard
of
maison
de
mort
the
house
of
the
red
death
as
you
would
call
it
that
is
where
we
are
in
the
dungeon
room
it
is
a
hudson
bay
post
abandoned
almost
since
i
can
remember
when
i
was
a
child
the
smallpox
plague
came
this
way
and
killed
all
the
people
nineteen
years
ago
the
red
plague
came
again
and
not
one
lived
through
it
in
this
de
mort
since
then
it
has
been
left
to
the
weasels
and
the
owls
it
is
shunned
by
every
living
soul
between
the
athabasca
and
the
bay
that
is
why
you
are
safe
here
ye
gods
breathed
howland
is
there
anything
more
croisset
safe
from
what
man
safe
from
what
from
those
who
wish
to
kill
you
you
would
not
go
into
the
south
so
meleese
has
compelled
you
to
go
into
the
north
for
a
moment
howland
sat
as
if
stunned
do
you
understand
persisted
croisset
smiling
i
i
think
i
do
replied
howland
tensely
you
mean
meleese
jean
took
the
words
from
him
i
mean
that
you
would
have
died
last
night
had
it
not
been
for
meleese
you
escaped
from
the
coyote
but
you
would
not
have
escaped
from
the
other
that
is
all
i
can
tell
you
but
you
will
be
safe
here
those
who
seek
your
life
will
soon
believe
that
you
are
dead
and
then
we
will
let
you
go
back
is
that
not
a
kind
fate
for
one
who
deserves
to
be
cut
into
bits
and
fed
to
the
ravens
you
will
tell
me
nothing
more
jean
the
engineer
asked
nothing
except
that
while
i
would
like
to
kill
you
i
have
sympathy
for
you
that
perhaps
is
because
i
once
lived
in
the
south
for
six
years
i
was
with
the
company
in
montreal
where
i
went
to
school
he
rose
to
his
feet
tying
the
flap
of
his
caribou
skin
coat
about
his
throat
then
he
unbolted
and
opened
the
door
faintly
there
came
to
them
as
if
from
a
great
distance
the
wailing
grief
of
woonga
the
dog
you
said
there
was
death
here
whispered
howland
leaning
close
to
his
shoulder
there
is
one
who
has
lived
here
since
the
last
plague
replied
croisset
under
his
breath
he
lost
his
wife
and
children
and
it
drove
him
mad
that
is
why
we
came
down
so
quietly
he
lived
in
a
little
cabin
out
there
on
the
edge
of
the
clearing
and
when
i
went
to
it
there
was
a
sapling
over
the
house
with
a
flag
at
the
end
of
it
when
the
plague
comes
to
us
we
hang
out
a
red
flag
as
a
warning
to
others
that
is
one
of
our
laws
the
flag
is
blown
to
tatters
by
the
winds
he
is
dead
howland
shuddered
of
the
smallpox
yes
for
a
few
moments
they
stood
in
silence
then
croisset
added
you
will
remain
here
until
i
return
he
went
out
closing
and
barring
the
door
from
the
other
side
and
howland
seated
himself
again
in
the
chair
beside
the
table
fifteen
minutes
later
the
returned
bearing
with
him
a
pack
and
a
jug
there
is
wood
back
of
the
stove
here
is
food
and
water
for
a
week
and
furs
for
your
bed
now
i
will
cut
those
thongs
about
your
wrists
do
you
mean
to
say
you
going
to
leave
me
here
alone
in
this
wretched
prison
cried
howland
is
it
not
better
than
a
grave
i
will
be
back
at
the
end
of
a
week
the
door
was
partly
open
and
for
the
last
time
there
came
to
ears
the
mourning
howl
of
the
old
dog
on
the
mountain
top
almost
threateningly
he
gripped
croisset
arm
jean
if
you
do
come
back
what
will
happen
he
heard
the
chuckling
you
will
die
pleasantly
and
taking
your
own
time
at
it
which
is
much
better
than
dying
over
a
case
of
dynamite
but
i
will
come
back
again
the
door
was
closed
and
bolted
and
the
sound
of
footsteps
quickly
died
away
beyond
the
log
walls
many
minutes
passed
before
howland
thought
of
his
pipe
or
a
fire
then
shiveringly
he
went
to
seek
the
fuel
which
jean
had
told
him
was
behind
the
stove
the
old
bay
stove
was
soon
roaring
with
the
fire
which
he
built
and
as
the
soothing
fumes
of
his
pipe
impregnated
the
damp
air
of
the
room
he
experienced
a
sensation
of
comfort
which
was
in
strange
contrast
to
the
exciting
happenings
of
the
past
few
days
at
last
he
was
alone
with
nothing
to
do
for
a
week
but
eat
sleep
and
smoke
he
had
plenty
of
tobacco
and
an
inspection
of
the
pack
showed
that
croisset
had
left
him
well
stocked
with
food
tilted
back
in
a
chair
with
his
feet
on
the
table
he
absorbed
the
cheerful
heat
from
the
stove
sent
up
clouds
of
smoke
and
wondered
if
the
had
already
started
back
into
the
south
what
would
macdonald
say
when
jackpine
came
in
with
the
report
that
he
had
slipped
to
his
death
in
the
waterfall
probably
his
first
move
would
be
to
send
the
most
powerful
team
on
the
wekusko
in
pursuit
of
gregson
and
thorne
the
departing
engineers
would
be
compelled
to
return
and
then
he
laughed
aloud
and
began
pacing
back
and
forth
across
the
rotted
floor
of
his
prison
as
he
pictured
the
consternation
of
the
two
seniors
and
then
a
flush
burned
in
his
face
and
his
eyes
glowed
as
he
thought
of
meleese
in
spite
of
himself
she
had
saved
him
from
his
enemies
and
he
blessed
croisset
for
having
told
him
the
meaning
of
this
flight
into
the
north
once
again
she
had
betrayed
him
but
this
time
it
was
to
save
his
life
and
his
heart
leaped
in
joyous
faith
at
this
proof
of
her
love
for
him
he
believed
that
he
understood
the
whole
scheme
now
even
his
enemies
would
think
him
dead
they
would
leave
the
wekusko
and
after
a
time
when
it
was
safe
for
him
to
return
he
would
be
given
his
freedom
with
the
passing
of
the
hours
gloomier
thoughts
shadowed
these
anticipations
in
some
mysterious
way
meleese
was
closely
associated
with
those
who
sought
his
life
and
if
they
disappeared
she
would
disappear
with
them
he
was
convinced
of
that
and
then
could
he
find
her
again
would
she
go
into
the
south
to
civilization
or
deeper
into
the
untraveled
wildernesses
of
the
north
in
answer
to
his
question
there
flashed
through
his
mind
the
words
of
jean
croisset
i
know
of
a
hundred
men
between
athabasca
and
the
bay
who
would
kill
you
for
what
you
have
said
yes
she
would
go
into
the
north
somewhere
in
that
vast
desolation
of
which
jean
had
spoken
he
would
find
her
even
though
he
spent
half
of
his
life
in
the
search
it
was
past
midnight
when
he
spread
out
the
furs
and
undressed
for
bed
he
opened
the
stove
door
and
from
the
bunk
watched
the
faint
flickerings
of
the
dying
firelight
on
the
log
walls
as
slumber
closed
his
eyes
he
was
conscious
of
a
sound
the
faint
hungerful
wailing
cry
to
which
he
had
listened
that
first
night
near
prince
albert
it
was
a
wolf
and
drowsily
he
wondered
how
he
could
hear
the
cry
through
the
thick
log
walls
of
his
prison
the
answer
came
to
him
the
moment
he
opened
his
eyes
hours
later
a
bit
of
pale
sunlight
was
falling
into
the
room
and
he
saw
that
it
entered
through
a
narrow
aperture
close
up
to
the
ceiling
after
he
had
prepared
his
breakfast
he
dragged
the
table
under
this
aperture
and
by
standing
on
it
was
enabled
to
peer
through
a
hundred
yards
away
was
the
black
edge
of
the
spruce
and
balsam
forest
between
him
and
the
forest
half
smothered
in
the
deep
snow
was
a
cabin
and
he
shuddered
as
he
saw
floating
over
it
the
little
red
signal
of
death
of
which
croisset
had
told
him
the
night
before
with
the
breaking
of
this
day
the
hours
seemed
of
interminable
length
for
a
time
he
amused
himself
by
searching
every
corner
and
crevice
of
his
prison
room
but
he
found
nothing
of
interest
beyond
what
he
had
already
discovered
he
examined
the
door
which
croisset
had
barred
on
him
and
gave
up
all
hope
of
escape
in
that
direction
he
could
barely
thrust
his
arm
through
the
aperture
that
opened
out
on
the
cabin
for
the
first
time
since
the
stirring
beginning
of
his
adventures
at
prince
albert
a
sickening
sense
of
his
own
impotency
began
to
weigh
on
howland
he
was
a
prisoner
penned
up
in
a
desolate
room
in
the
heart
of
a
wilderness
and
he
jack
howland
a
man
who
had
always
taken
pride
in
his
physical
prowess
had
allowed
one
man
to
place
him
there
his
blood
began
to
boil
as
he
thought
of
it
now
as
he
had
time
and
silence
in
which
to
look
back
on
what
had
happened
he
was
enraged
at
the
pictures
that
flashed
one
after
another
before
him
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
used
as
nothing
more
than
a
pawn
in
a
strange
and
mysterious
game
it
was
not
through
his
efforts
alone
that
he
had
been
saved
in
the
fight
on
the
saskatchewan
trail
blindly
he
had
walked
into
the
trap
at
the
coyote
still
more
blindly
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
led
into
the
ambush
at
the
wekusko
camp
and
more
like
a
child
than
a
man
he
had
submitted
himself
to
jean
croisset
he
stamped
back
and
forth
across
the
room
smoking
viciously
and
his
face
grew
red
with
the
thoughts
that
were
stirring
venom
within
him
he
placed
no
weight
on
circumstances
in
these
moments
he
found
no
excuse
for
himself
in
no
situation
had
he
displayed
the
white
feather
at
no
time
had
he
felt
a
thrill
of
fear
his
courage
and
recklessness
had
terrified
meleese
had
astonished
croisset
and
yet
what
had
he
done
from
the
beginning
from
the
moment
he
first
placed
his
foot
in
the
chinese
cafe
his
enemies
had
held
the
he
had
been
compelled
to
play
a
passive
part
up
to
the
point
of
the
ambush
on
the
wekusko
trail
he
might
have
found
some
vindication
for
himself
but
this
experience
with
jean
croisset
it
was
enough
to
madden
him
now
that
he
was
alone
to
think
about
it
why
had
not
taken
advantage
of
jean
as
jackpine
and
the
frenchman
had
taken
advantage
of
him
he
saw
now
what
he
might
have
done
somewhere
not
very
far
back
the
sledge
carrying
meleese
and
jackpine
had
turned
into
the
unknown
they
two
were
alone
why
had
he
not
made
croisset
a
prisoner
instead
of
allowing
himself
to
be
caged
up
like
a
weakling
he
swore
aloud
as
there
dawned
on
him
more
and
more
a
realization
of
the
opportunity
he
had
lost
at
the
point
of
a
gun
he
could
have
forced
croisset
to
overtake
the
other
sledge
he
could
have
surprised
jackpine
as
they
had
surprised
him
on
the
trail
and
then
he
smiled
but
there
was
no
humor
in
the
smile
he
at
least
would
have
held
the
and
what
would
meleese
have
done
he
asked
himself
question
after
question
answering
them
quickly
and
decisively
in
the
same
breath
meleese
loved
him
he
would
have
staked
his
life
on
that
his
blood
leaped
as
he
felt
again
the
thrill
of
her
kisses
when
she
had
come
to
him
as
he
lay
bound
and
gagged
beside
the
trail
she
had
taken
his
head
in
her
arms
and
through
the
grief
of
her
face
he
had
seen
shining
the
light
of
a
great
love
that
had
glorified
it
for
all
time
for
him
she
loved
him
and
he
had
let
her
slip
away
from
him
had
weakly
surrendered
himself
at
a
moment
when
everything
that
he
had
dreamed
of
might
have
been
within
his
grasp
with
jackpine
and
croisset
in
his
power
he
went
no
further
was
it
too
late
to
do
these
things
now
croisset
would
return
with
a
sort
of
satisfaction
it
occurred
to
him
that
his
actions
had
disarmed
the
frenchman
of
suspicion
he
believed
that
it
would
be
easy
to
overcome
croisset
to
force
him
to
follow
in
the
trail
of
meleese
and
jackpine
and
that
trail
it
would
probably
lead
to
the
very
stronghold
of
his
enemies
but
what
of
that
he
loaded
his
pipe
again
puffing
out
clouds
of
smoke
until
the
room
was
thick
with
it
that
trail
would
take
him
to
meleese
wherever
she
was
heretofore
his
enemies
had
come
to
him
now
he
would
go
to
them
with
croisset
in
his
power
and
with
none
of
his
enemies
aware
of
his
presence
everything
would
be
in
his
favor
he
laughed
aloud
as
a
sudden
thrilling
thought
flashed
into
his
mind
as
a
last
resort
he
would
use
jean
as
a
decoy
he
foresaw
how
easy
it
would
be
to
bring
meleese
to
him
to
see
croisset
his
own
presence
would
be
like
the
dropping
of
a
bomb
at
her
feet
in
that
moment
when
she
saw
what
he
was
risking
for
her
that
he
was
determined
to
possess
her
would
she
not
surrender
to
the
pleading
of
his
love
if
not
he
would
do
the
other
thing
that
which
had
brought
the
joyous
laugh
to
his
lips
all
was
fair
in
war
and
love
and
theirs
was
a
game
of
love
because
of
her
love
for
him
meleese
had
kidnapped
him
from
his
post
of
duty
had
sent
him
a
prisoner
to
this
in
the
wilderness
love
had
exculpated
her
that
same
love
would
exculpate
him
he
would
make
her
a
prisoner
and
jean
should
drive
them
back
to
the
wekusko
meleese
herself
had
set
the
pace
and
he
would
follow
it
and
what
woman
if
she
loved
a
man
would
not
surrender
after
this
in
their
sledge
trip
he
would
have
her
to
himself
for
not
only
an
hour
or
two
but
for
days
surely
in
that
time
he
could
win
there
would
be
pursuit
perhaps
he
might
have
to
fight
but
he
was
willing
and
a
trifle
anxious
to
fight
he
went
to
bed
that
night
and
dreamed
of
things
that
were
to
happen
a
second
day
a
third
night
and
a
third
day
came
with
each
hour
grew
his
anxiety
for
jean
return
at
times
he
was
almost
feverish
to
have
the
affair
over
with
he
was
confident
of
the
outcome
and
yet
he
did
not
fail
to
take
the
frenchman
true
measurement
he
knew
that
jean
was
like
live
wire
and
steel
as
agile
as
a
cat
more
than
a
match
with
himself
in
open
fight
despite
his
own
superior
weight
and
size
he
devised
a
dozen
schemes
for
jean
undoing
one
was
to
leap
on
him
while
he
was
eating
another
to
spring
on
him
and
choke
him
into
partial
insensibility
as
he
knelt
beside
his
pack
or
fed
the
fire
a
third
to
strike
a
blow
from
behind
that
would
render
him
powerless
but
there
was
something
in
this
last
that
was
repugnant
to
him
he
remembered
that
jean
had
saved
his
life
that
in
no
instance
had
he
given
him
physical
pain
he
would
watch
for
an
opportunity
take
advantage
of
the
frenchman
as
croisset
had
taken
advantage
of
him
but
he
would
not
hurt
him
seriously
it
should
be
as
fair
a
struggle
as
jean
had
offered
him
and
with
the
handicap
in
his
favor
the
best
man
would
win
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
howland
was
awakened
by
a
sound
that
came
through
the
aperture
in
the
wall
it
was
the
sharp
yelping
bark
of
a
dog
followed
an
instant
later
by
the
sharper
crack
of
a
whip
and
a
familiar
voice
jean
croisset
had
returned
with
a
single
leap
he
was
out
of
his
bunk
half
dressed
he
darted
to
the
door
and
crouched
there
the
muscles
of
his
arms
tightening
his
body
tense
with
the
gathering
forces
within
him
the
spur
of
the
moment
had
driven
him
to
quick
decision
his
opportunity
would
come
when
jean
croisset
passed
through
that
door
chapter
xii
the
fight
beyond
the
door
howland
heard
jean
pause
there
followed
a
few
moments
silence
as
though
the
other
were
listening
for
sound
within
then
there
came
a
fumbling
at
the
bar
and
the
door
swung
inward
called
jean
cheerful
voice
as
he
stepped
inside
is
it
possible
you
are
not
up
with
all
this
and
his
eyes
had
gone
to
the
empty
bunk
despite
his
cheerful
greeting
howland
saw
that
the
frenchman
face
was
haggard
and
pale
as
he
turned
quickly
toward
him
he
observed
no
further
than
that
but
flung
his
whole
weight
on
the
unprepared
croisset
and
together
they
crashed
to
the
floor
there
was
scarce
a
struggle
and
jean
lay
still
he
was
flat
on
his
back
his
arms
pinioned
to
his
sides
and
bringing
himself
astride
the
frenchman
body
so
that
each
knee
imprisoned
an
arm
howland
coolly
began
looping
the
babeesh
thongs
that
he
had
snatched
from
the
table
as
he
sprang
to
the
door
behind
howland
back
jean
legs
shot
suddenly
upward
in
a
quick
choking
clutch
of
muscle
they
gripped
about
his
neck
like
powerful
arms
and
in
another
instant
he
was
twisted
backward
with
a
force
that
sent
him
half
to
the
opposite
wall
he
staggered
to
his
feet
dazed
for
a
moment
and
jean
croisset
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
his
caribou
skin
coat
thrown
off
his
hands
clenched
his
eyes
darkening
with
a
dangerous
fire
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
the
fire
died
away
and
as
he
advanced
slowly
his
shoulders
punched
over
his
white
teeth
gleamed
in
a
smile
howland
smiled
back
and
advanced
to
meet
him
there
was
no
humor
no
friendliness
in
the
smiles
both
had
seen
that
flash
of
teeth
and
deadly
scintillation
of
eyes
at
other
times
both
knew
what
it
meant
i
believe
that
i
will
kill
you
said
jean
softly
there
was
no
excitement
no
tremble
of
passion
in
his
voice
i
have
been
thinking
that
i
ought
to
kill
you
i
had
almost
made
up
my
mind
to
kill
you
when
i
came
back
to
this
de
mort
it
is
the
justice
of
god
that
i
kill
you
the
two
men
circled
like
beasts
in
a
pit
howland
in
the
attitude
of
a
boxer
jean
with
his
shoulders
bent
his
arms
slightly
curved
at
his
side
the
toes
of
his
moccasined
feet
bearing
his
weight
suddenly
he
launched
himself
at
the
other
throat
in
a
flash
howland
stepped
a
little
to
one
side
and
shot
out
a
crashing
blow
that
caught
jean
on
the
side
of
the
head
and
sent
him
flat
on
his
back
croisset
came
to
his
feet
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
ever
come
into
contact
with
science
he
was
puzzled
his
head
rang
and
for
a
few
moments
he
was
dizzy
he
darted
in
again
in
his
old
quick
way
and
received
a
blow
that
dazed
him
this
time
he
kept
his
feet
i
am
sure
now
that
i
am
going
to
kill
you
he
said
as
coolly
as
before
there
was
something
terribly
calm
and
decisive
in
his
voice
he
was
not
excited
he
was
not
afraid
his
fingers
did
not
go
near
the
weapons
in
his
belt
and
slowly
the
smile
faded
from
howland
lips
as
jean
circled
about
him
he
had
never
fought
a
man
of
this
kind
never
had
he
looked
on
the
appalling
confidence
that
was
in
his
antagonist
eyes
from
those
eyes
rather
than
from
the
man
he
found
himself
slowly
retreating
they
followed
him
never
taking
themselves
from
his
face
in
them
the
fire
returned
and
grew
deeper
two
dull
red
spots
began
to
glow
in
croisset
cheeks
and
he
laughed
softly
when
he
suddenly
leaped
in
so
that
howland
struck
at
him
and
missed
he
knew
what
to
expect
now
and
howland
knew
what
to
expect
it
was
the
science
of
one
world
pitted
against
that
of
another
the
science
of
civilization
against
that
of
the
wilderness
howland
was
trained
in
his
art
for
sport
jean
had
played
with
wounded
lynx
his
was
the
quickness
of
sight
of
instinct
the
quickness
of
the
great
north
loon
that
had
often
played
this
same
game
with
his
of
the
whose
ripping
fangs
carried
death
so
quickly
that
eyes
could
not
follow
a
third
and
a
fourth
time
he
came
within
distance
and
howland
struck
and
missed
i
am
going
to
kill
you
he
said
again
to
this
point
howland
had
remained
cool
in
his
science
he
knew
to
be
half
the
battle
but
he
felt
in
him
now
a
slow
swelling
anger
the
smiling
flash
in
jean
eyes
began
to
irritate
him
the
fearless
taunting
gleam
of
his
teeth
his
audacious
confidence
put
him
on
edge
twice
again
he
struck
out
swiftly
but
jean
had
come
and
gone
like
a
dart
his
lithe
body
fifty
pounds
lighter
than
howland
seemed
to
be
that
of
a
boy
dodging
him
in
some
tantalizing
sport
the
frenchman
made
no
effort
at
attack
his
were
the
tactics
of
the
wolf
at
the
heels
of
the
bull
moose
of
the
lynx
before
the
prongs
of
a
cornered
buck
tiring
worrying
ceaseless
howland
striking
muscles
began
to
ache
and
his
breath
was
growing
shorter
with
the
exertions
which
seemed
to
have
no
effect
on
croisset
for
a
few
moments
he
took
the
aggressive
rushing
jean
to
the
stove
behind
the
table
twice
around
the
room
striving
vainly
to
drive
him
into
a
corner
to
reach
him
with
one
of
the
sweeping
blows
which
croisset
evaded
with
the
lightning
quickness
of
a
when
he
stopped
his
breath
came
in
gasps
jean
drew
nearer
smiling
ferociously
cool
i
am
going
to
kill
you
he
repeated
again
howland
dropped
his
arms
his
fingers
relaxed
and
he
forced
his
breath
between
his
lips
as
if
he
were
on
the
point
of
exhaustion
there
were
still
a
few
tricks
in
his
science
and
these
he
knew
were
about
his
last
cards
he
backed
into
a
corner
and
jean
followed
his
eyes
flashing
a
steely
light
his
body
growing
more
and
more
tense
now
i
am
going
to
kill
you
he
said
in
the
same
low
voice
i
am
going
to
break
your
neck
howland
backed
against
the
wall
partly
turned
as
if
fearing
the
attack
and
yet
without
strength
to
repel
it
there
was
a
contemptuous
smile
on
croisset
lips
as
he
poised
himself
for
an
instant
then
he
leaped
in
and
as
his
fingers
gripped
at
the
other
throat
right
arm
shot
upward
in
a
deadly
punch
that
caught
his
antagonist
under
the
jaw
without
a
sound
jean
staggered
back
tottered
for
a
moment
on
his
feet
and
fell
to
the
floor
fifty
seconds
later
he
opened
his
eyes
to
find
his
hands
bound
behind
his
back
and
howland
standing
at
his
feet
but
that
was
a
good
one
he
gasped
after
he
had
taken
a
long
breath
or
two
will
you
teach
it
to
me
get
up
commanded
howland
i
have
no
time
to
waste
croisset
he
caught
the
frenchman
by
the
shoulders
and
helped
him
to
a
chair
near
the
table
then
he
took
possession
of
the
other
weapons
including
the
revolver
which
jean
had
taken
from
him
and
began
to
dress
he
spoke
no
word
until
he
was
done
do
you
understand
what
is
going
to
happen
croisset
he
cried
then
his
eyes
blazing
hotly
do
you
understand
that
what
you
have
done
will
put
you
behind
prison
bars
for
ten
years
or
more
does
it
dawn
on
you
that
i
going
to
take
you
back
to
the
authorities
and
that
as
soon
as
we
reach
the
wekusko
i
have
twenty
men
back
on
the
trail
of
these
friends
of
yours
a
gray
pallor
spread
itself
over
jean
thin
face
the
great
god
you
can
not
do
that
not
howland
fingers
dug
into
the
edge
of
the
table
by
this
great
god
of
yours
croisset
but
i
will
and
why
not
is
it
because
meleese
is
among
this
gang
of
and
murderers
pish
my
dear
jean
you
must
be
a
fool
they
tried
to
kill
me
on
the
trail
tried
it
again
in
the
coyote
and
you
came
back
here
determined
to
kill
me
you
held
the
from
the
first
now
it
mine
i
swear
that
if
i
take
you
back
to
the
wekusko
we
get
you
all
yes
and
that
jean
was
straining
against
the
table
it
rests
with
you
croisset
i
will
bargain
with
you
either
i
shall
take
you
back
to
the
wekusko
hand
you
over
to
the
authorities
and
send
a
force
after
the
others
or
you
shall
take
me
to
meleese
which
shall
it
be
and
if
i
take
you
to
meleese
howland
straightened
his
voice
trembling
a
little
with
excitement
if
you
take
me
to
meleese
and
swear
to
do
as
i
say
i
shall
bring
no
harm
to
you
or
your
friends
and
meleese
jean
eyes
darkened
again
you
will
not
harm
her
harm
there
was
a
laughing
tremor
in
howland
voice
good
god
man
are
you
so
blind
that
you
ca
see
that
i
am
doing
this
because
of
her
i
tell
you
that
i
love
her
and
that
i
am
willing
to
die
in
fighting
for
her
until
now
i
have
had
the
chance
you
and
your
friends
have
played
a
cowardly
underhand
game
croisset
you
have
taken
me
from
behind
at
every
move
and
now
it
up
to
you
to
square
yourself
a
little
or
there
going
to
be
hell
to
pay
understand
you
take
me
to
meleese
or
there
be
a
that
will
put
you
and
the
whole
bunch
out
of
business
again
howland
laughed
leaning
his
white
face
toward
jean
come
which
shall
it
be
croisset
a
cold
glitter
like
the
snap
of
sparks
from
striking
steels
shot
from
the
frenchman
eyes
the
grayish
pallor
went
from
his
face
his
teeth
gleamed
in
the
enigmatic
smile
that
had
half
undone
howland
in
the
fight
you
are
mistaken
in
some
things
he
said
quietly
until
i
have
fought
for
you
and
not
against
you
but
now
you
have
left
me
but
one
choice
i
will
take
you
to
meleese
and
that
means
good
cried
howland
la
la
not
so
good
as
you
think
it
means
that
as
surely
as
the
dogs
carry
us
there
you
will
never
come
back
dieu
your
death
is
certain
howland
turned
briskly
to
the
stove
hungry
jean
he
asked
more
companionably
let
not
quarrel
man
you
had
your
fun
and
now
i
going
to
have
mine
have
you
had
breakfast
i
was
anticipating
that
pleasure
with
you
replied
jean
with
grim
humor
and
then
after
i
had
fed
you
you
were
going
to
kill
me
my
dear
jean
laughed
howland
flopping
a
huge
caribou
steak
on
the
naked
top
of
the
stove
real
nice
fellow
you
are
eh
you
ought
to
be
killed
so
you
said
before
when
i
see
meleese
i
going
to
know
the
reason
why
or
or
what
kill
you
jean
i
just
about
made
up
my
mind
that
you
ought
to
be
killed
if
any
one
dies
up
where
we
going
croisset
it
will
be
you
first
of
all
jean
remained
silent
a
few
minutes
later
howland
brought
the
caribou
steak
a
dish
of
flour
cakes
and
a
big
pot
of
coffee
to
the
table
then
he
went
behind
jean
and
untied
his
hands
when
he
sat
down
at
his
own
side
of
the
table
he
cocked
his
revolver
and
placed
it
beside
his
tin
plate
jean
grimaced
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
means
business
said
his
captor
warningly
if
at
any
time
i
think
you
deserve
it
i
shall
shoot
you
in
your
tracks
croisset
so
arouse
my
suspicions
i
took
your
word
of
honor
said
jean
sarcastically
and
i
will
take
yours
to
an
extent
replied
howland
pouring
the
coffee
suddenly
he
picked
up
the
revolver
you
never
saw
me
shoot
did
you
see
that
cup
over
there
he
pointed
to
a
small
tin
hanging
to
a
nail
on
the
wall
a
dozen
paces
from
them
three
times
without
missing
he
drove
bullets
through
it
and
smiled
across
at
croisset
i
am
going
to
give
you
the
use
of
your
arms
and
legs
except
at
night
he
said
it
is
safe
grunted
jean
i
give
you
my
word
that
i
will
be
good
the
sun
was
up
when
croisset
led
the
way
outside
his
dogs
and
sledge
were
a
hundred
yards
from
the
building
and
howland
first
move
was
to
take
possession
of
the
frenchman
rifle
and
eject
the
cartridges
while
jean
tossed
chunks
of
caribou
flesh
to
the
huskies
when
they
were
ready
to
start
jean
turned
slowly
and
half
reached
out
a
mittened
hand
to
the
engineer
he
said
softly
i
can
not
help
liking
you
though
i
know
that
i
should
have
killed
you
long
ago
i
tell
you
again
that
if
you
go
into
the
north
there
is
only
one
chance
in
a
hundred
that
you
will
come
back
alive
great
god
up
where
you
wish
to
go
the
very
trees
will
fall
on
you
and
the
carrion
ravens
pick
out
your
eyes
and
that
chance
that
one
chance
in
a
hundred
i
will
take
interrupted
howland
decisively
i
was
going
to
say
finished
jean
quietly
that
unless
accident
has
befallen
those
who
left
wekusko
yesterday
that
one
chance
is
gone
if
you
go
south
you
are
safe
if
you
go
into
the
north
you
are
no
better
than
a
dead
man
there
will
at
least
be
a
little
fun
at
the
finish
laughed
the
young
engineer
come
jean
hit
up
the
dogs
i
say
you
are
a
fool
and
a
brave
man
said
croisset
and
his
whip
twisted
sinuously
in
and
cracked
in
sharp
command
over
the
yellow
backs
of
the
huskies
chapter
xiii
the
pursuit
behind
the
sledge
ran
howland
to
the
right
of
the
team
ran
jean
once
or
twice
when
croisset
glanced
back
his
eyes
met
those
of
the
engineer
he
cracked
his
whip
and
smiled
and
howland
teeth
gleamed
back
coldly
in
reply
a
mutual
understanding
flashed
between
them
in
these
glances
in
a
sudden
spurt
howland
knew
that
the
frenchman
could
quickly
put
distance
between
them
but
not
a
distance
that
his
bullets
could
not
cover
in
the
space
of
a
breath
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
fire
deliberately
and
with
his
greatest
skill
if
croisset
made
the
slightest
movement
toward
escape
if
he
was
compelled
to
kill
or
wound
his
companion
he
could
still
go
on
alone
with
the
dogs
for
the
trail
of
meleese
and
jackpine
would
be
as
plain
as
their
own
which
they
were
following
back
into
the
south
for
the
second
time
since
coming
into
the
north
he
felt
the
blood
leaping
through
his
veins
as
on
that
first
night
in
prince
albert
when
from
the
mountain
he
had
heard
the
lone
wolf
and
when
later
he
had
seen
the
beautiful
face
through
the
hotel
window
howland
was
one
of
the
few
men
who
possess
unbounded
confidence
in
themselves
who
place
a
certain
pride
in
their
physical
as
well
as
their
mental
capabilities
and
he
was
confident
now
his
successful
and
indomitable
fight
over
obstacles
in
a
big
city
had
made
this
confidence
a
genuine
part
of
his
being
it
was
a
confidence
that
flushed
his
face
with
joyous
enthusiasm
as
he
ran
after
the
dogs
and
that
astonished
and
puzzled
jean
croisset
but
you
are
a
strange
man
exclaimed
the
frenchman
when
he
brought
the
dogs
down
to
a
walk
after
a
half
mile
run
blessed
saints
you
are
laughing
and
i
swear
it
is
no
laughing
matter
should
a
man
be
happy
when
he
is
going
to
his
wedding
jean
puffed
howland
gasping
to
get
back
the
breath
he
had
lost
but
not
when
he
going
to
his
funeral
if
i
were
one
of
your
blessed
saints
i
hit
you
over
the
head
with
a
thunderbolt
croisset
good
lord
what
sort
of
a
heart
have
you
got
inside
of
your
jacket
man
up
there
where
we
going
is
the
sweetest
little
girl
in
the
whole
world
i
love
her
she
loves
me
why
i
be
happy
now
that
i
know
i
going
to
see
her
again
very
soon
and
take
her
back
into
the
south
with
me
the
devil
grunted
jean
perhaps
you
jealous
croisset
suggested
howland
great
scott
i
had
thought
of
i
got
one
of
my
own
to
love
and
i
would
trade
her
for
all
else
in
the
world
damned
if
i
can
understand
you
swore
the
engineer
you
appear
to
be
half
human
you
say
you
in
love
and
yet
you
rather
risk
your
life
than
help
out
meleese
and
me
what
the
deuce
does
it
mean
that
what
i
doing
helping
meleese
i
would
have
done
her
a
greater
service
if
i
had
killed
you
back
there
on
the
trail
and
stripped
your
body
for
those
things
that
would
be
foul
enough
to
eat
it
i
have
told
you
a
dozen
times
that
it
is
god
justice
that
you
die
and
you
are
going
to
die
very
soon
no
i
not
going
to
die
jean
i
going
to
see
meleese
and
going
back
into
the
south
with
me
and
if
you
real
good
you
may
have
the
pleasure
of
driving
us
back
to
the
wekusko
croisset
and
you
can
be
my
best
man
at
the
wedding
what
do
you
say
to
that
that
you
are
mad
or
a
fool
retorted
jean
cracking
his
whip
viciously
the
dogs
swung
sharply
from
the
trail
heading
from
their
southerly
course
into
the
northwest
we
will
save
a
day
by
doing
this
explained
croisset
at
the
sharp
word
of
inquiry
we
will
hit
the
other
trail
twenty
miles
west
of
here
while
by
following
back
to
where
they
turned
we
would
travel
sixty
miles
to
reach
the
same
point
that
one
chance
in
a
hundred
which
you
have
depends
on
this
if
the
other
sledge
has
passed
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
started
the
dogs
into
a
trot
look
here
cried
howland
running
beside
him
who
is
with
this
other
sledge
those
who
tried
to
kill
you
on
the
trail
and
at
the
coyote
he
answered
quickly
howland
fell
half
a
dozen
paces
behind
by
the
end
of
the
first
hour
he
was
compelled
to
rest
frequently
by
taking
to
the
sledge
and
their
progress
was
much
slower
jean
no
longer
made
answer
to
his
occasional
questions
doggedly
he
swung
on
ahead
to
the
right
and
a
little
behind
the
team
leader
and
howland
could
see
that
for
some
reason
croisset
was
as
anxious
as
himself
to
make
the
best
time
possible
his
own
impatience
increased
as
the
morning
lengthened
jean
assurance
that
the
mysterious
enemies
who
had
twice
attempted
his
life
were
only
a
short
distance
behind
them
or
a
short
distance
ahead
set
a
new
and
desperate
idea
at
work
in
his
brain
he
was
confident
that
these
men
from
the
wekusko
were
his
chief
menace
and
that
with
them
once
out
of
the
way
and
with
the
frenchman
in
his
power
the
fight
which
he
was
carrying
into
the
enemy
country
would
be
half
won
there
would
then
be
no
one
to
recognize
him
but
meleese
his
heart
leaped
with
joyous
hope
and
he
leaned
forward
on
the
sledge
to
examine
croisset
empty
gun
it
was
an
automatic
and
croisset
glancing
back
over
the
loping
backs
of
the
huskies
caught
him
smiling
he
ran
more
frequently
now
and
longer
distances
and
with
the
passing
of
each
mile
his
determination
to
strike
a
decisive
blow
increased
if
they
reached
the
trail
of
meleese
and
jackpine
before
the
crossing
of
the
second
sledge
he
would
lay
in
wait
for
his
old
enemies
if
they
had
preceded
them
he
would
pursue
and
surprise
them
in
camp
in
either
case
he
would
possess
an
overwhelming
advantage
with
the
same
calculating
attention
to
detail
that
he
would
have
shown
in
the
arrangement
of
plans
for
the
building
of
a
tunnel
or
a
bridge
he
drew
a
mental
map
of
his
scheme
and
its
possibilities
there
would
be
at
least
two
men
with
the
sledge
and
possibly
three
if
they
surrendered
at
the
point
of
his
rifle
without
a
fight
he
would
compel
jean
to
tie
them
up
with
while
he
held
them
under
cover
if
they
made
a
move
to
offer
resistance
he
would
shoot
with
the
automatic
he
could
kill
or
wound
the
three
before
they
could
reach
their
rifles
which
would
undoubtedly
be
on
the
sledge
the
situation
had
now
reached
a
point
where
he
no
longer
took
into
consideration
what
these
men
might
be
to
meleese
as
they
continued
into
the
northwest
howland
noted
that
the
thicker
forest
was
gradually
clearing
into
wide
areas
of
small
banskian
pine
and
that
the
rock
ridges
and
dense
swamps
which
had
impeded
their
progress
were
becoming
less
numerous
an
hour
before
noon
after
a
tedious
climb
to
the
top
of
a
frozen
ridge
croisset
pointed
down
into
a
vast
level
plain
lying
between
them
and
other
great
ridges
far
to
the
north
that
is
a
bit
of
the
barren
lands
that
creeps
down
between
those
mountains
off
there
he
said
do
you
see
that
black
forest
that
looks
like
a
charred
log
in
the
snow
to
the
south
and
west
of
the
mountains
that
is
the
break
that
leads
into
the
country
of
the
athabasca
somewhere
between
this
point
and
that
we
will
strike
the
trail
mon
dieu
i
had
half
expected
to
see
them
out
there
on
the
plain
who
meleese
and
jackpine
or
no
the
others
shall
we
have
dinner
here
not
until
we
hit
the
trail
replied
howland
i
anxious
to
know
about
that
one
chance
in
a
hundred
you
given
me
hope
of
croisset
if
they
have
passed
if
they
are
ahead
of
us
you
might
just
as
well
stand
out
there
and
let
me
put
a
bullet
through
you
he
went
to
the
head
of
the
dogs
guiding
them
down
the
rough
side
of
the
ridge
while
howland
steadied
the
toboggan
from
behind
for
of
an
hour
they
traversed
the
low
bush
of
the
plain
in
silence
from
every
rising
snow
hummock
jean
scanned
the
white
desolation
about
them
and
each
time
as
nothing
that
was
human
came
within
his
vision
he
turned
toward
the
engineer
with
a
sinister
shrug
of
his
shoulders
once
three
moving
caribou
a
mile
or
more
away
brought
a
quick
cry
to
his
lips
and
howland
noticed
that
a
sudden
flush
of
excitement
came
into
his
face
replaced
in
the
next
instant
by
a
look
of
disappointment
after
this
he
maintained
a
more
careful
guard
over
the
frenchman
they
had
covered
less
than
half
of
the
distance
to
the
caribou
trail
when
in
a
small
open
space
free
of
bush
croisset
voice
rose
sharply
and
the
team
stopped
what
do
you
think
of
it
he
cried
pointing
to
the
snow
what
do
you
think
of
that
barely
cutting
into
the
edge
of
the
open
was
the
broken
crust
of
two
sledge
trails
for
a
moment
howland
forgot
his
caution
and
bent
over
to
examine
the
trails
with
his
back
to
his
companion
when
he
looked
up
there
was
a
curious
laughing
gleam
in
jean
eyes
but
you
are
careless
he
exclaimed
be
more
careful
i
may
give
myself
up
to
another
temptation
like
that
the
deuce
you
say
cried
howland
springing
back
quickly
i
much
obliged
jean
if
it
was
for
the
moral
effect
of
the
thing
i
shake
hands
with
you
on
that
how
far
ahead
of
us
do
you
suppose
they
are
croisset
had
fallen
on
his
knees
in
the
trail
the
crust
is
freshly
broken
he
said
after
a
moment
they
have
been
gone
not
less
than
two
or
three
hours
perhaps
since
morning
see
this
white
glistening
surface
over
the
first
trail
like
a
billion
growing
out
of
it
that
is
the
work
of
three
or
four
days
cold
the
first
sledge
passed
that
long
ago
howland
turned
and
picked
up
croisset
rifle
the
frenchman
watched
him
as
he
slipped
a
clip
full
of
cartridges
into
the
breech
if
there
a
snack
of
cold
stuff
in
the
pack
dig
it
out
he
commanded
we
eat
on
the
run
if
you
got
anything
to
eat
if
you
have
we
go
hungry
we
going
to
overtake
that
sledge
sometime
this
afternoon
or
or
bust
the
saints
be
blessed
then
we
are
most
certain
to
bust
gasped
jean
and
if
we
do
the
dogs
will
non
it
is
impossible
is
there
anything
to
eat
a
morsel
of
cold
meat
that
is
all
but
i
say
that
it
is
impossible
that
sledge
howland
interrupted
him
with
an
impatient
gesture
and
i
say
that
if
there
is
anything
to
eat
in
there
get
it
out
and
be
quick
about
it
croisset
we
going
to
overtake
those
precious
friends
of
yours
and
i
warn
you
that
if
you
make
any
attempt
to
lose
time
something
unpleasant
is
going
to
happen
understand
jean
had
bent
to
unstrap
one
end
of
the
sledge
pack
and
an
angry
flash
leaped
into
his
eyes
at
the
threatening
tone
of
the
engineer
voice
for
a
moment
he
seemed
on
the
point
of
speech
but
caught
himself
and
in
silence
divided
the
small
chunk
of
meat
which
he
drew
from
the
pack
giving
the
larger
share
to
howland
as
he
went
to
the
head
of
the
dogs
only
once
or
twice
during
the
next
hour
did
he
look
back
and
after
each
of
these
glances
he
redoubled
his
efforts
at
urging
on
the
huskies
before
they
had
come
to
the
edge
of
the
black
banskian
forest
which
jean
had
pointed
out
from
the
farther
side
of
the
plain
howland
saw
that
the
pace
was
telling
on
the
team
the
leader
was
trailing
lame
and
now
and
then
the
whole
pack
would
settle
back
in
their
traces
to
be
urged
on
again
by
the
fierce
cracking
of
croisset
long
whip
to
add
to
his
own
discomfiture
howland
found
that
he
could
no
longer
keep
up
with
jean
and
the
dogs
and
with
his
weight
added
to
the
sledge
the
huskies
settled
down
into
a
tugging
walk
thus
they
came
into
the
deep
low
forest
and
jean
apparently
oblivious
of
the
exhaustion
of
both
man
and
dogs
walked
now
in
advance
of
the
team
his
eyes
constantly
on
the
thin
trail
ahead
howland
could
not
fail
to
see
that
his
unnecessary
threat
of
a
few
hours
before
still
rankled
in
the
frenchman
mind
and
several
times
he
made
an
effort
to
break
the
other
taciturnity
but
jean
strode
on
in
moody
silence
answering
only
those
things
which
were
put
to
him
directly
and
speaking
not
an
unnecessary
word
at
last
the
engineer
jumped
from
the
sledge
and
overtook
his
companion
hold
on
jean
he
cried
i
got
enough
you
right
and
i
want
to
apologize
we
busted
that
is
the
dogs
and
i
are
busted
and
we
might
as
well
give
it
up
until
we
had
a
feed
what
do
you
say
i
say
that
you
have
stopped
just
in
time
replied
croisset
with
purring
softness
another
half
hour
and
we
would
have
been
through
the
forest
and
just
beyond
that
in
the
edge
of
the
plain
are
those
whom
you
seek
meleese
and
her
people
that
is
what
i
started
to
tell
you
back
there
when
you
shut
me
up
if
it
were
not
for
meleese
i
would
let
you
go
on
and
then
what
would
happen
then
if
you
made
your
visit
to
them
in
broad
day
listen
jean
lifted
a
warning
hand
faintly
there
came
to
them
through
the
forest
the
distant
baying
of
a
hound
that
is
one
of
our
dogs
from
the
mackenzie
country
he
went
on
softly
an
insinuating
triumph
in
his
low
voice
now
that
i
have
brought
you
here
what
are
you
going
to
do
shall
we
go
on
and
take
dinner
with
those
who
are
going
to
kill
you
or
will
you
wait
a
few
hours
eh
which
shall
it
be
for
a
moment
howland
stood
motionless
stunned
by
the
frenchman
words
quickly
he
recovered
himself
his
eyes
burned
with
a
metallic
gleam
as
they
met
the
half
taunt
in
croisset
cool
smile
if
i
had
not
stopped
you
we
would
have
gone
on
he
questioned
tensely
to
be
sure
retorted
croisset
still
smiling
you
warned
me
to
lose
no
time
that
something
would
happen
if
i
did
with
a
quick
movement
howland
drew
his
revolver
and
leveled
it
at
the
frenchman
heart
if
you
ever
prayed
to
those
blessed
saints
of
yours
do
it
now
jean
croisset
i
going
to
kill
you
he
cried
fiercely
chapter
xiv
the
gleam
of
the
light
in
a
single
breath
the
face
of
jean
croisset
became
no
more
than
a
mask
of
what
it
had
been
the
taunting
smile
left
his
lips
and
a
gray
pallor
spread
over
his
face
as
he
saw
howland
finger
crooked
firmly
on
the
trigger
of
his
revolver
in
another
instant
there
came
the
sound
of
a
metallic
snap
damnation
an
empty
cartridge
howland
exclaimed
i
forgot
to
load
after
those
three
shots
at
the
cup
it
coming
this
time
jean
purposely
he
snapped
the
second
empty
cartridge
the
great
god
gasped
jean
from
deep
in
the
forest
came
again
the
baying
of
the
mackenzie
hound
this
time
it
was
much
nearer
and
for
a
moment
howland
eyes
left
the
frenchman
terrified
face
as
he
turned
his
head
to
listen
they
are
coming
exclaimed
croisset
i
swear
to
again
howland
pistol
covered
his
heart
then
it
is
even
more
necessary
that
i
kill
you
he
said
with
frightful
calmness
i
warned
you
that
i
would
kill
you
if
you
led
me
into
a
trap
croisset
the
dogs
are
bushed
there
is
no
way
out
of
this
but
to
fight
if
there
are
people
coming
down
the
trail
listen
to
that
this
time
from
still
nearer
came
the
shout
of
a
man
and
then
of
another
followed
by
the
huskies
sharp
yelping
as
they
started
afresh
on
the
trail
the
flush
of
excitement
that
had
come
into
howland
face
paled
until
he
stood
as
white
as
the
frenchman
but
it
was
not
the
whiteness
of
fear
his
eyes
were
like
blue
steel
flashing
in
the
sunlight
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
fight
he
repeated
even
more
calmly
than
before
if
we
were
a
mile
or
two
back
there
it
could
all
happen
as
i
planned
it
but
here
they
will
hear
the
shots
cried
jean
the
post
is
no
more
than
a
gunshot
beyond
the
forest
and
there
are
plenty
there
who
would
come
out
to
see
what
it
means
quick
follow
me
possibly
they
are
hunters
going
out
to
the
if
it
comes
to
the
worst
what
then
demanded
howland
you
can
shoot
me
a
little
later
temporized
the
frenchman
with
a
show
of
his
old
coolness
i
am
afraid
of
that
gun
i
will
get
you
out
of
this
if
i
can
will
you
give
me
the
chance
or
will
you
shoot
i
will
shoot
if
you
fail
replied
the
engineer
barely
were
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
when
croisset
sprang
to
the
head
of
the
dogs
seized
the
leader
by
his
and
half
dragged
the
team
and
sledge
through
the
thick
bush
that
edged
the
trail
a
dozen
paces
farther
on
the
dense
scrub
opened
into
the
clearer
run
of
the
banskian
through
which
jean
started
at
a
slow
trot
with
howland
a
yard
behind
him
and
the
huskies
following
with
cleverness
in
the
sinuous
twistings
of
the
trail
which
the
frenchman
marked
out
for
them
they
had
progressed
not
more
than
three
hundred
yards
when
there
came
to
them
for
a
third
time
the
hallooing
of
a
voice
with
a
sharp
hup
hup
and
a
low
crack
of
his
whip
jean
stopped
the
dogs
the
virgin
be
praised
but
that
is
luck
he
exclaimed
they
have
turned
off
into
another
trail
to
the
east
if
they
had
come
on
to
that
break
in
the
bush
where
we
dragged
the
sledge
through
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
gasp
of
relief
they
would
not
be
fools
enough
to
pass
it
without
wondering
howland
had
broken
the
breech
of
his
revolver
and
was
replacing
the
three
empty
cartridges
with
fresh
ones
there
will
be
no
mistake
next
time
he
said
holding
out
the
weapon
you
were
as
near
your
death
a
few
moments
ago
as
ever
before
in
your
life
croisset
and
now
for
a
little
plain
understanding
between
us
until
we
stopped
out
there
i
had
some
faith
in
you
now
i
have
none
i
regard
you
as
my
worst
enemy
and
though
you
are
deuced
near
to
your
friends
i
tell
you
that
you
were
never
in
a
tighter
box
in
your
life
if
i
fail
in
my
mission
here
you
shall
die
if
others
come
along
that
trail
before
dark
and
run
us
down
i
will
kill
you
unless
you
make
it
possible
for
me
to
see
and
talk
with
meleese
i
will
kill
you
your
life
hangs
on
my
success
with
my
failure
your
death
is
as
certain
as
the
coming
of
night
i
am
going
to
put
a
bullet
through
you
at
the
slightest
suspicion
of
treachery
under
the
circumstances
what
do
you
propose
to
do
i
am
glad
that
you
changed
your
mind
and
i
will
not
tempt
you
again
i
will
do
the
best
that
i
can
said
jean
through
a
narrow
break
in
the
tops
of
the
banskian
pines
a
few
feathery
flakes
of
snow
were
falling
and
jean
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
slit
of
gray
sky
above
them
within
an
hour
it
will
be
snowing
heavily
he
affirmed
if
they
do
not
run
across
our
trail
by
that
time
we
shall
be
safe
he
led
the
way
through
the
forest
again
more
slowly
and
with
greater
caution
than
before
and
whenever
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
he
caught
the
dull
gleam
of
howland
revolver
as
it
pointed
at
the
hollow
of
his
back
the
devil
but
you
make
me
uncomfortable
he
protested
the
hammer
is
up
too
yes
it
is
up
said
howland
grimly
and
it
never
leaves
your
back
croisset
if
the
gun
should
go
off
accidentally
it
would
bore
a
hole
clean
through
you
half
an
hour
later
the
frenchman
halted
where
the
banskians
climbed
the
side
of
a
sloping
ridge
if
you
could
trust
me
i
would
ask
to
go
on
ahead
whispered
jean
this
ridge
shuts
in
the
plain
and
just
over
the
top
of
it
is
an
old
cabin
which
has
been
abandoned
for
many
years
there
is
not
one
chance
in
a
thousand
of
there
being
any
one
there
though
it
is
a
good
fox
ridge
at
this
season
from
it
you
may
see
the
light
in
window
at
night
he
did
not
stop
to
watch
the
effect
of
his
last
words
but
began
picking
his
way
up
the
ridge
with
the
dogs
tugging
at
his
heels
at
the
top
he
swung
sharply
between
two
huge
masses
of
rock
and
in
the
lee
of
the
largest
of
these
almost
entirely
sheltered
from
the
drifts
piled
up
by
easterly
winds
they
came
suddenly
on
a
small
log
hut
about
it
there
were
no
signs
of
life
with
unusual
eagerness
jean
scanned
the
surface
of
the
snow
and
when
he
saw
that
there
was
trail
of
neither
man
nor
beast
in
the
unbroken
crust
a
look
of
relief
came
into
his
face
so
far
i
have
saved
my
hide
he
grinned
now
look
for
yourself
and
see
if
jean
croisset
has
not
kept
his
word
a
dozen
steps
had
taken
him
through
a
screen
of
shrub
to
the
opposite
slope
of
the
ridge
with
outstretched
arm
he
pointed
down
into
the
plain
and
as
howland
eyes
followed
its
direction
he
stood
throbbing
with
sudden
excitement
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
sheltered
in
a
dip
of
the
plain
were
three
or
four
log
buildings
rising
black
and
desolate
out
of
the
white
waste
one
of
these
buildings
was
a
large
structure
similar
to
that
in
which
howland
had
been
imprisoned
and
as
he
looked
a
team
and
sledge
appeared
from
behind
one
of
the
cabins
and
halted
close
to
the
wall
of
the
large
building
the
driver
was
plainly
visible
and
to
howland
astonishment
he
suddenly
began
to
ascend
the
side
of
this
wall
for
the
moment
howland
had
not
thought
of
a
stair
jean
attitude
drew
his
eyes
the
frenchman
had
thrust
himself
half
out
of
the
screening
bushes
and
was
staring
through
the
telescope
of
his
hands
with
an
exclamation
he
turned
quickly
to
the
engineer
look
do
you
see
that
man
climbing
the
stair
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
he
is
the
one
who
hit
you
over
the
head
on
the
trail
and
also
one
of
those
who
shut
you
up
in
the
coyote
those
are
his
quarters
at
the
post
and
possibly
he
is
going
up
to
see
meleese
if
you
were
much
of
a
shot
you
could
settle
a
score
or
two
from
here
the
figure
had
stopped
evidently
on
a
platform
midway
up
the
side
of
the
building
he
stood
for
a
moment
as
if
scanning
the
plain
between
him
and
the
mountain
then
disappeared
howland
had
not
spoken
a
word
but
every
nerve
in
his
body
tingled
strangely
you
say
meleese
is
there
he
questioned
hesitatingly
and
he
who
is
that
man
croisset
jean
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
drew
himself
back
into
the
bush
turning
leisurely
toward
the
old
cabin
i
will
not
tell
you
that
he
protested
i
have
brought
you
to
this
place
i
have
pointed
out
to
you
the
stair
that
leads
to
the
room
where
you
will
find
meleese
you
may
cut
me
into
ribbons
for
the
ravens
but
i
will
tell
you
no
more
again
the
threatening
fire
leaped
into
howland
eyes
i
will
trouble
you
to
put
your
hands
behind
your
back
croisset
he
commanded
i
am
going
to
return
a
certain
compliment
of
yours
by
tying
your
hands
with
this
piece
of
babeesh
which
you
used
on
me
after
that
and
after
that
urged
jean
with
a
touch
of
the
old
taunt
in
his
voice
and
stopping
with
his
back
to
the
engineer
and
his
hands
behind
him
after
that
you
will
tell
me
all
that
i
want
to
know
finished
howland
tightening
the
thong
about
his
wrists
he
led
the
way
then
to
the
cabin
the
door
was
closed
but
opened
readily
as
he
put
his
weight
against
it
the
single
room
was
lighted
by
a
window
through
which
a
mass
of
snow
had
drifted
and
contained
nothing
more
than
a
rude
table
built
against
one
of
the
log
walls
three
supply
boxes
that
had
evidently
been
employed
as
stools
and
a
cracked
and
stove
that
had
from
all
appearances
long
passed
into
disuse
he
motioned
the
frenchman
to
a
seat
at
one
end
of
the
table
without
a
word
he
then
went
outside
securely
toggled
the
leading
dog
and
returning
closed
the
door
and
seated
himself
at
the
end
of
the
table
opposite
jean
the
light
from
the
open
window
fell
full
on
croisset
dark
face
and
shone
in
a
silvery
streak
along
the
top
of
howland
revolver
as
the
muzzle
of
it
rested
casually
on
a
line
with
the
other
breast
there
was
a
menacing
click
as
the
engineer
drew
back
the
hammer
now
my
dear
jean
we
ready
to
begin
the
real
game
he
explained
here
we
are
high
and
dry
and
down
there
just
far
enough
away
to
be
out
of
hearing
of
this
revolver
when
i
shoot
are
those
we
going
to
play
against
so
far
i
been
completely
in
the
dark
i
know
of
no
reason
why
i
should
go
down
there
openly
and
be
welcomed
and
given
a
good
supper
and
yet
at
the
same
time
i
know
that
my
life
would
be
worth
a
tinker
damn
if
i
go
down
you
can
clear
up
the
whole
business
and
that
what
you
going
to
do
when
i
understand
why
i
am
scheduled
to
be
murdered
on
sight
i
wo
be
handicapped
as
i
now
am
so
go
ahead
and
spiel
if
you
do
i
blow
your
head
off
jean
sat
unflinching
his
lips
drawn
tightly
his
head
set
square
and
defiant
you
may
shoot
he
said
quietly
i
have
sworn
on
a
cross
of
the
virgin
to
tell
you
no
more
than
i
have
you
could
not
torture
me
into
revealing
what
you
ask
slowly
howland
raised
his
revolver
once
more
croisset
will
you
tell
me
a
deafening
explosion
filled
the
little
cabin
from
the
lobe
of
ear
there
ran
a
red
trickle
of
blood
his
face
had
gone
deathly
pale
but
even
as
the
bullet
had
stung
him
within
an
inch
of
his
brain
he
had
not
flinched
will
you
tell
me
croisset
this
time
the
black
pit
of
the
engineer
revolver
centered
squarely
between
the
frenchman
eyes
the
eyes
of
the
two
men
met
over
the
blue
steel
with
a
cry
howland
slowly
lowered
his
weapon
good
god
but
you
a
brave
man
jean
croisset
he
cried
i
sooner
kill
a
dozen
men
that
i
know
than
you
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
went
to
the
door
there
was
still
but
little
snow
in
the
air
to
the
north
the
horizon
was
growing
black
with
the
early
approach
of
the
northern
night
with
a
nervous
laugh
he
returned
to
jean
deuce
take
it
if
i
do
feel
like
apologizing
to
you
he
exclaimed
does
your
ear
hurt
no
more
than
if
i
had
scratched
it
with
a
thorn
returned
jean
politely
you
are
good
with
the
pistol
i
would
not
profit
by
killing
you
just
now
mused
howland
seating
himself
again
on
the
box
and
resting
his
chin
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
as
he
looked
across
at
the
other
but
that
a
pretty
good
intimation
that
i
desperate
and
mean
business
croisset
we
wo
quarrel
about
the
things
i
asked
you
what
i
here
for
is
to
see
meleese
now
how
is
that
to
happen
for
the
life
of
me
i
do
know
replied
jean
as
calmly
as
though
a
bullet
had
not
nipped
the
edge
of
his
ear
a
moment
before
there
is
only
one
way
i
can
see
and
that
is
to
wait
and
watch
from
this
mountain
top
until
meleese
drives
out
her
dogs
she
has
her
own
team
and
in
ordinary
seasons
frequently
goes
out
alone
or
with
one
of
the
women
at
the
post
she
has
had
enough
of
late
and
i
doubt
if
she
will
find
pleasure
in
her
dogs
for
a
long
time
i
had
planned
to
use
you
said
howland
but
i
lost
faith
in
you
honestly
croisset
i
believe
you
would
stick
me
in
the
back
almost
as
quickly
as
those
murderers
down
there
not
in
the
back
smiled
the
frenchman
unmoved
i
have
had
opportunities
to
do
that
since
that
fight
back
there
i
do
not
believe
that
i
want
to
kill
you
but
i
would
be
a
fool
to
trust
you
is
that
so
not
if
i
gave
you
my
word
that
is
something
we
do
not
break
up
here
as
you
do
down
among
the
wekusko
people
and
farther
south
but
you
murder
people
for
pastime
eh
my
dear
jean
croisset
shrugged
his
shoulders
without
speaking
see
here
croisset
said
howland
with
sudden
earnestness
i
almost
tempted
to
take
a
chance
with
you
will
you
go
down
to
the
post
in
some
way
gain
access
to
meleese
and
give
her
a
message
from
me
and
the
message
what
would
it
be
it
would
bring
meleese
up
to
this
cabin
are
you
sure
i
am
certain
that
it
would
will
you
go
the
devil
take
you
cried
howland
angrily
if
i
was
not
certain
that
i
would
need
you
later
i
garrote
you
where
you
sit
he
rose
and
went
to
the
old
stove
it
was
still
capable
of
holding
fire
and
as
it
had
grown
too
dark
outside
for
the
smoke
to
be
observed
from
the
post
he
proceeded
to
prepare
a
supper
of
hot
coffee
and
meat
jean
watched
him
in
silence
and
not
until
food
and
drink
were
on
the
table
did
the
engineer
himself
break
silence
of
course
i
not
going
to
feed
you
he
said
curtly
so
i
have
to
free
your
hands
but
be
careful
he
placed
his
revolver
on
the
table
beside
him
after
he
had
freed
croisset
i
might
assassinate
you
with
a
fork
chuckled
the
frenchman
softly
his
black
eyes
laughing
over
his
coffee
cup
i
drink
your
health
and
wish
you
happiness
you
lie
snapped
howland
jean
lowered
the
cup
without
drinking
it
the
truth
he
insisted
since
that
fight
back
there
i
can
not
help
but
wish
you
happiness
i
drink
also
to
the
happiness
of
meleese
also
to
the
happiness
of
those
who
tried
to
kill
you
on
the
trail
and
at
the
coyote
but
how
is
it
all
to
come
those
at
the
post
are
happy
because
they
believe
that
you
are
dead
you
will
not
be
happy
until
they
are
dead
and
meleese
how
will
all
this
bring
happiness
to
her
i
tell
you
that
i
am
as
deep
in
trouble
as
you
howland
may
the
virgin
strike
me
dead
if
i
not
he
drank
his
eyes
darkening
gloomily
in
that
moment
there
flashed
into
howland
mind
a
memory
of
the
battle
that
jean
had
fought
for
him
on
the
great
north
trail
you
nearly
killed
one
of
them
that
night
at
prince
albert
he
said
slowly
i
ca
understand
why
you
fought
for
me
then
and
wo
help
me
now
but
you
did
and
you
afraid
to
go
down
there
until
i
have
regrown
a
beard
interrupted
jean
with
a
low
chuckling
laugh
you
would
not
be
the
only
one
to
die
if
they
saw
me
again
like
this
but
that
is
enough
i
will
say
no
more
i
really
do
want
to
make
you
uncomfortable
jean
howland
apologized
as
he
secured
the
frenchman
hands
again
after
they
had
satisfied
their
hearty
appetites
but
unless
you
swear
by
your
virgin
or
something
else
that
you
will
make
no
attempt
to
call
assistance
i
shall
have
to
gag
you
what
do
you
say
i
will
make
no
outcry
i
give
you
my
word
for
that
with
another
length
of
babeesh
howland
tied
his
companion
legs
i
going
to
investigate
a
little
he
explained
i
am
not
afraid
of
your
voice
for
if
you
begin
to
shout
i
will
hear
you
first
but
with
your
legs
free
you
might
take
it
into
your
head
to
run
away
would
you
mind
spreading
a
blanket
on
the
floor
if
you
are
gone
long
this
box
will
grow
hard
and
sharp
a
few
minutes
later
after
he
had
made
his
prisoner
as
comfortable
as
possible
in
the
cabin
howland
went
again
through
the
fringe
of
scrub
bush
to
the
edge
of
the
ridge
below
him
the
plain
was
lost
in
the
gloom
of
night
he
could
see
nothing
of
the
buildings
at
the
post
but
two
or
three
lights
gleaming
faintly
through
the
darkness
overhead
there
were
no
stars
thickening
snow
shut
out
what
illumination
there
might
have
been
in
the
north
and
even
as
he
stood
looking
into
the
desolation
to
the
west
the
snow
fell
faster
and
the
lights
grew
fainter
and
fainter
until
all
was
a
chaos
of
blackness
in
these
moments
a
desire
that
was
almost
madness
swept
over
him
since
his
fight
with
jean
the
swift
passing
of
events
had
confined
his
thoughts
to
their
one
objective
the
finding
of
meleese
and
her
people
he
had
assured
himself
that
his
every
move
was
to
be
a
cool
and
calculating
one
that
nothing
not
even
his
great
love
should
urge
him
beyond
that
reason
which
had
made
him
a
among
men
as
he
stood
with
the
snow
falling
heavily
on
him
he
knew
that
his
trail
would
be
covered
before
another
day
that
for
an
indefinite
period
he
might
safely
wait
and
watch
for
meleese
on
the
mountain
top
and
yet
slowly
he
made
his
way
down
the
side
of
the
ridge
a
little
way
out
there
in
the
gloom
barely
beyond
the
call
of
his
voice
was
the
girl
for
whom
he
was
willing
to
sacrifice
all
that
he
had
ever
achieved
in
life
with
each
step
the
desire
in
him
grew
the
impulse
to
bring
himself
nearer
to
her
to
steal
across
the
plain
to
approach
in
the
silent
smother
of
the
storm
until
he
could
look
on
the
light
which
jean
croisset
had
told
him
would
gleam
from
her
window
he
descended
to
the
foot
of
the
ridge
and
headed
into
the
plain
taking
the
caution
to
bury
his
feet
deep
in
the
snow
that
he
might
have
a
trail
to
guide
him
back
to
the
cabin
at
first
he
found
himself
impeded
by
low
bush
then
the
plain
became
more
open
and
he
knew
that
there
was
nothing
but
the
night
and
the
snow
to
shut
out
his
vision
ahead
still
he
had
no
motive
no
reason
for
what
he
did
the
snow
would
cover
his
tracks
before
morning
there
would
be
no
harm
done
and
he
might
get
a
glimpse
of
the
light
of
light
it
came
on
his
vision
with
a
suddenness
that
set
his
heart
leaping
a
dog
barked
ahead
of
him
so
near
that
he
stopped
in
his
tracks
and
then
suddenly
there
shot
through
the
the
bright
gleam
of
a
lamp
before
he
had
taken
another
breath
he
was
aware
of
what
had
happened
a
curtain
had
been
drawn
aside
in
the
chaos
ahead
he
was
almost
on
the
walls
of
the
post
and
the
light
gleamed
from
high
up
from
the
head
of
the
stair
for
a
space
he
stood
still
listening
and
watching
there
was
no
other
light
no
other
sound
after
the
barking
of
the
dog
about
him
the
snow
fell
with
fluttering
noiselessness
and
it
filled
him
with
a
sensation
of
safety
the
sharpest
eyes
could
not
see
him
the
keenest
ears
could
not
hear
him
and
he
advanced
again
until
before
him
there
rose
out
of
the
gloom
a
huge
shadowy
mass
that
was
blacker
than
the
night
itself
the
one
lighted
window
was
plainly
visible
now
its
curtain
drawn
and
as
he
looked
a
shadow
passed
over
it
was
it
a
shadow
the
window
darkened
as
the
figure
within
came
nearer
to
it
and
howland
stood
with
clenched
hands
and
wildly
beating
heart
almost
ready
to
call
out
softly
a
name
a
little
nearer
one
more
step
and
he
would
know
he
might
throw
a
chunk
of
a
cartridge
from
his
belt
and
then
the
shadow
disappeared
dimly
howland
made
out
the
stair
and
he
went
to
it
and
looked
up
ten
feet
above
him
the
light
shone
out
he
looked
into
the
gloom
behind
him
into
the
gloom
out
of
which
he
had
come
nothing
nothing
but
the
storm
swiftly
he
mounted
the
stair
chapter
xv
in
the
bedroom
chamber
flattening
himself
closely
against
the
black
logs
of
the
wall
howland
paused
on
the
platform
at
the
top
of
the
stair
his
groping
hand
touched
the
jam
of
a
door
and
he
held
his
breath
when
his
fingers
incautiously
rattled
the
steel
of
a
latch
in
another
moment
he
passed
on
three
paces
along
the
platform
at
last
sinking
on
his
knees
in
the
snow
close
under
the
window
his
eyes
searched
the
lighted
room
an
inch
at
a
time
he
saw
a
section
of
wall
at
first
dimly
illuminated
then
a
small
table
near
the
window
covered
with
books
and
magazines
and
beside
it
a
reclining
chair
buried
thick
under
a
great
white
bear
robe
on
the
table
but
beyond
his
vision
was
the
lamp
he
drew
himself
a
few
inches
more
through
the
snow
leaning
still
farther
ahead
until
he
saw
the
foot
of
a
white
bed
a
little
more
and
he
stopped
his
white
face
close
to
the
on
the
bed
facing
him
sat
meleese
her
chin
was
buried
in
the
cup
of
her
hands
and
he
noticed
that
she
was
in
a
and
that
her
beautiful
hair
was
loosed
and
flowing
in
glistening
waves
about
her
as
though
she
had
just
brushed
it
for
the
night
a
movement
a
slight
shifting
of
her
eyes
and
she
would
have
seen
him
he
was
filled
with
an
almost
mastering
impulse
to
press
his
face
closer
to
tap
on
the
window
to
draw
her
eyes
to
him
but
even
as
his
hand
rose
to
do
the
bidding
of
that
impulse
something
restrained
him
slowly
the
girl
lifted
her
head
and
he
was
thrilled
to
find
that
another
impulse
drew
him
back
until
his
ghostly
face
was
a
part
of
the
elusive
he
watched
her
as
she
turned
from
him
and
threw
back
the
glory
of
her
hair
until
it
half
hid
her
in
a
mass
of
copper
and
gold
from
his
distance
he
still
gazed
at
her
choking
and
undecided
while
she
gathered
it
in
three
heavy
strands
and
plaited
it
into
a
shining
braid
for
an
instant
his
eyes
wandered
beyond
her
presence
the
room
was
empty
he
saw
a
door
and
observed
that
it
opened
into
another
room
which
in
turn
could
be
entered
through
the
platform
door
behind
him
with
his
old
exactness
for
detail
he
leaped
to
definite
conclusion
these
were
meleese
apartments
at
the
post
separated
from
all
others
and
meleese
was
preparing
to
retire
for
the
night
if
the
outer
door
was
not
locked
and
he
entered
what
danger
could
there
be
of
interruption
it
was
late
the
post
was
asleep
he
had
seen
no
light
but
that
in
the
window
through
which
he
was
staring
the
thought
was
scarcely
born
before
he
was
at
the
platform
door
the
latch
clicked
gently
under
his
fingers
cautiously
he
pushed
the
door
inward
and
thrust
in
his
head
and
shoulders
the
air
inside
was
cold
and
frosty
he
reached
out
an
arm
to
the
right
and
his
hand
encountered
the
surface
of
a
wall
he
advanced
a
step
and
reached
out
to
the
left
there
too
his
hand
touched
a
wall
he
was
in
a
narrow
corridor
ahead
of
him
there
shone
a
thin
ray
of
light
from
under
the
door
that
opened
into
meleese
room
nerving
himself
for
the
last
move
he
went
boldly
to
the
door
knocked
lightly
to
give
some
warning
of
his
presence
and
entered
meleese
was
gone
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
scarce
believing
his
eyes
then
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
he
saw
a
curtain
undulating
slightly
as
if
from
the
movement
of
a
person
on
the
other
side
of
it
meleese
he
called
softly
white
and
dripping
with
snow
his
face
bloodless
in
the
tense
excitement
of
the
moment
he
stood
with
his
arms
half
reaching
out
when
the
curtain
was
thrust
aside
and
the
girl
stood
before
him
at
first
she
did
not
recognize
him
in
his
ghostly
disguise
but
before
the
startled
cry
that
was
on
her
lips
found
utterance
the
fear
that
had
blanched
her
face
gave
place
to
a
swift
sweeping
flood
of
color
for
a
space
there
was
no
word
between
them
as
they
stood
separated
by
the
breadth
of
the
room
howland
with
his
arms
held
out
to
her
in
pleading
silence
meleese
with
her
hands
clutched
to
her
bosom
her
throat
atremble
with
strange
sobbing
notes
that
made
no
more
sound
than
the
fluttering
of
a
bird
wing
and
howland
as
he
came
across
the
room
to
her
found
no
words
to
say
none
of
the
things
that
he
had
meant
to
whisper
to
her
but
drew
her
to
him
and
crushed
her
close
to
his
breast
knowing
that
in
this
moment
nothing
could
tell
her
more
eloquently
than
the
throbbing
of
his
own
heart
the
passionate
pressure
of
his
face
to
her
face
of
his
great
love
which
seemed
to
stir
into
life
the
very
silence
that
encompassed
them
it
was
a
silence
broken
after
a
moment
by
a
short
choking
cry
the
terror
of
a
face
turned
suddenly
up
to
him
robbed
of
its
flush
and
quivering
with
a
fear
that
still
found
no
voice
in
words
he
felt
the
girl
arms
straining
against
him
for
freedom
her
eyes
were
filled
with
a
staring
questioning
horror
as
though
his
presence
had
grown
into
a
thing
of
which
she
was
afraid
the
change
was
tonic
to
him
this
was
what
he
had
expected
first
terror
at
his
presence
the
struggle
against
his
will
and
there
surged
back
over
him
the
forces
he
had
reserved
for
this
moment
he
opened
his
arms
and
meleese
slipped
from
them
her
hands
clutched
again
in
the
clinging
drapery
of
her
bosom
i
have
come
for
you
meleese
he
said
as
calmly
as
though
his
arrival
had
been
expected
jean
is
my
prisoner
i
forced
him
to
drive
me
to
the
old
cabin
up
on
the
mountain
and
he
is
waiting
there
with
the
dogs
we
will
start
back
suddenly
he
sprang
to
her
again
his
voice
breaking
in
a
low
pleading
cry
my
god
do
you
see
now
how
i
love
you
he
went
on
taking
her
white
face
between
his
two
hands
do
you
understand
meleese
jean
and
i
have
fought
he
is
bound
hand
and
foot
up
there
in
the
cabin
and
i
am
waiting
for
you
for
you
he
pressed
her
face
against
him
her
lips
so
close
that
he
could
feel
their
quavering
breath
i
have
come
to
fight
for
you
if
you
wo
go
he
whispered
tensely
i
do
know
why
your
people
have
tried
to
kill
me
i
do
know
why
they
want
to
kill
me
and
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
now
i
want
you
i
wanted
you
since
that
first
glimpse
of
your
face
through
the
window
since
the
fight
on
the
trail
every
minute
every
hour
and
i
wo
give
you
up
as
long
as
i
alive
if
you
go
with
me
if
you
wo
go
now
he
held
her
closer
his
voice
trembling
in
her
hair
if
you
wo
go
i
going
to
stay
with
you
there
was
a
thrillingly
decisive
note
in
his
last
words
a
note
that
carried
with
it
more
than
all
he
had
said
before
and
as
meleese
partly
drew
away
from
him
again
she
gave
a
sharp
cry
of
protest
no
no
no
she
panted
her
hands
clutching
at
his
arm
you
must
go
back
now
now
she
pushed
him
toward
the
door
and
as
he
backed
a
step
looking
down
into
her
face
he
saw
the
choking
tremble
of
her
white
throat
heard
again
the
fluttering
terror
in
her
breath
they
will
kill
you
if
they
find
you
here
she
urged
they
think
you
are
dead
that
you
fell
through
the
ice
and
were
drowned
if
you
believe
me
if
you
do
believe
that
i
can
never
go
with
you
tell
jean
her
words
seemed
to
choke
her
as
she
struggled
to
finish
tell
jean
what
he
questioned
softly
will
you
go
then
she
cried
with
sobbing
eagerness
as
if
he
already
understood
her
will
you
go
back
if
jean
tells
you
everything
everything
about
me
about
no
he
interrupted
if
you
only
knew
then
you
would
go
back
and
never
see
me
again
you
would
understand
i
will
never
understand
he
interrupted
again
i
say
that
it
is
you
who
do
not
understand
meleese
i
do
care
what
jean
would
tell
me
nothing
that
has
ever
happened
can
make
me
not
want
you
do
you
understand
nothing
i
say
nothing
that
has
happened
that
can
ever
happen
unless
for
a
moment
he
stopped
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
nothing
nothing
in
the
world
meleese
he
repeated
almost
in
a
whisper
unless
you
did
not
tell
me
the
truth
back
on
the
trail
at
wekusko
when
you
said
that
it
was
not
a
sin
to
love
you
and
if
i
tell
you
if
i
confess
that
it
is
a
sin
that
i
lied
back
there
then
will
you
go
she
demanded
quickly
her
eyes
flamed
on
him
with
a
strange
light
no
he
said
calmly
i
would
not
believe
you
but
it
is
the
truth
i
lied
lied
terribly
to
you
i
have
sinned
even
more
terribly
and
and
you
must
go
do
you
understand
me
now
if
some
one
should
come
and
find
you
here
there
would
be
a
fight
he
said
grimly
i
have
come
prepared
to
fight
he
waited
a
moment
and
in
the
silence
the
brown
head
in
front
of
him
dropped
slowly
and
he
saw
a
tremor
pass
through
the
slender
form
as
if
it
had
been
torn
by
an
instant
pain
the
pallor
had
gone
from
howland
face
the
mute
surrender
in
the
bowed
head
the
soft
sobbing
notes
that
he
heard
now
in
the
girl
breath
the
confession
that
he
read
in
her
voiceless
grief
set
his
heart
leaping
and
again
he
drew
her
close
into
his
arms
and
turned
her
face
up
to
his
own
there
was
no
resistance
now
no
words
no
pleading
for
him
to
go
but
in
her
eyes
he
saw
the
prayerful
entreaty
with
which
she
had
come
to
him
on
the
wekusko
trail
and
in
the
quivering
red
mouth
the
same
torture
and
love
and
that
had
burned
themselves
into
his
soul
there
love
triumph
undying
faith
shone
in
his
eyes
and
he
crushed
her
face
closer
until
the
lovely
mouth
lay
pouted
like
a
crimson
rose
for
him
to
kiss
you
you
told
me
something
that
was
true
once
back
there
he
whispered
and
you
promised
that
you
would
do
it
again
you
sinned
in
the
way
that
i
mean
and
in
the
way
that
you
want
me
to
believe
his
arms
tightened
still
more
about
her
and
his
voice
was
suddenly
filled
with
a
tense
quick
eagerness
why
do
you
tell
me
everything
he
asked
you
believe
that
if
i
knew
certain
things
i
would
never
want
to
see
you
again
that
i
would
go
back
into
the
south
you
have
told
me
that
then
if
you
want
me
to
go
why
do
you
reveal
these
things
to
me
if
you
ca
do
that
go
with
me
we
will
go
anywhere
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
he
stopped
at
the
look
that
had
come
into
her
face
her
eyes
were
turned
to
the
window
he
saw
them
filled
with
a
strange
terror
and
involuntarily
his
own
followed
them
to
where
the
storm
was
beating
softly
against
the
close
to
the
lighted
glass
was
pressed
a
man
face
he
caught
a
flashing
glimpse
of
a
pair
of
eyes
staring
in
at
them
of
a
thick
wild
beard
whitened
by
the
snow
he
knew
the
face
when
life
seemed
slipping
out
of
his
throat
he
had
looked
up
into
it
that
night
of
the
ambush
on
the
great
north
trail
there
was
the
same
hatred
the
same
demoniac
fierceness
in
it
now
with
a
quick
movement
howland
sprang
away
from
the
girl
and
leveled
his
revolver
to
where
the
face
had
been
over
the
shining
barrel
he
saw
only
the
taunting
emptiness
of
the
storm
scarcely
had
the
face
disappeared
when
there
came
the
loud
shout
of
a
man
the
hoarse
calling
of
a
name
and
then
of
another
and
after
that
the
quick
furious
opening
of
the
outer
door
howland
whirled
his
weapon
pointing
to
the
only
entrance
the
girl
was
ahead
of
him
and
with
a
warning
cry
he
swung
the
muzzle
of
his
gun
upward
in
a
moment
she
had
pushed
the
bolt
that
locked
the
room
from
the
inside
and
had
leaped
back
to
him
her
face
white
her
breath
breaking
in
fear
she
spoke
no
word
but
with
a
moan
of
terror
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
pulled
him
past
the
light
and
beyond
the
thick
curtain
that
had
hidden
her
when
he
had
entered
the
room
a
few
minutes
before
they
were
in
a
second
room
palely
lighted
by
a
mass
of
coals
gleaming
through
the
open
door
of
a
box
stove
and
with
a
second
window
looking
out
into
the
thick
night
fiercely
she
dragged
him
to
this
window
her
fingers
biting
deep
into
the
flesh
of
his
arm
you
must
go
through
this
she
cried
chokingly
quick
o
my
god
wo
you
hurry
wo
you
go
howland
had
stopped
from
the
blackness
of
the
corridor
there
came
the
beat
of
heavy
fists
on
the
door
and
the
rage
of
a
thundering
voice
demanding
admittance
from
out
in
the
night
it
was
answered
by
the
sharp
barking
of
a
dog
and
the
shout
of
a
second
voice
why
should
i
go
he
asked
i
told
you
a
few
moments
ago
that
i
had
come
prepared
to
fight
meleese
i
shall
stay
and
fight
please
please
go
she
sobbed
striving
to
pull
him
nearer
to
the
window
you
can
get
away
in
the
storm
the
snow
will
cover
your
trail
if
you
stay
they
will
kill
you
kill
you
i
prefer
to
fight
and
be
killed
rather
than
to
run
away
without
you
he
interrupted
if
you
will
go
she
crushed
herself
against
his
breast
i
ca
go
now
this
way
she
urged
but
i
will
come
to
you
i
promise
that
i
will
come
to
you
for
an
instant
her
hands
clasped
his
face
will
you
go
if
i
promise
you
that
you
swear
that
you
will
follow
me
that
you
will
come
down
to
the
wekusko
my
god

me
the
truth
meleese
yes
yes
i
will
come
to
you
if
you
go
now
she
broke
from
him
and
he
heard
her
fumbling
at
the
window
i
will
come
i
will
come
but
not
to
wekusko
they
will
follow
you
there

back
to
prince
albert
to
the
hotel
where
i
looked
at
you
through
the
window
i
will
come
there
sometime
as
soon
as
i
can
a
blast
of
cold
air
swept
into
his
face
he
had
thrust
his
revolver
into
its
holster
and
now
again
for
an
instant
he
held
meleese
close
in
his
arms
you
will
be
my
wife
he
whispered
he
felt
her
throbbing
against
him
suddenly
her
arms
tightened
around
his
neck
yes
if
you
want
me
then
if
you
want
me
after
you
know
what
i
am
now
go
please
please
go
he
pulled
himself
through
the
window
hanging
for
a
last
moment
to
the
ledge
if
you
fail
to
come
within
a
month
i
shall
return
he
said
her
hands
were
at
his
face
again
once
more
as
on
the
trail
at
le
pas
he
felt
the
sweet
pressure
of
her
lips
i
will
come
she
whispered
her
hands
thrust
him
back
and
he
was
forced
to
drop
to
the
snow
below
scarcely
had
his
feet
touched
when
there
sounded
the
fierce
yelp
of
a
dog
close
to
him
and
as
he
darted
away
into
the
smother
of
the
storm
the
brute
followed
at
his
heels
barking
excitedly
in
the
manner
of
the
mongrel
curs
that
had
found
their
way
up
from
the
south
between
the
dog
alarm
and
the
loud
outcry
of
men
there
was
barely
time
in
which
to
draw
a
breath
from
the
stair
platform
came
a
rapid
fusillade
of
rifle
shots
that
sang
through
the
air
above
howland
head
and
mingled
with
the
fire
was
a
hoarse
voice
urging
on
the
cur
that
followed
within
a
leap
of
his
heels
the
presence
of
the
dog
filled
the
engineer
with
a
fear
that
he
had
not
anticipated
not
for
an
instant
did
the
brute
give
slack
to
his
tongue
as
they
raced
through
the
night
and
howland
knew
now
that
the
storm
and
the
darkness
were
of
little
avail
in
his
race
for
life
there
was
but
one
chance
and
he
determined
to
take
it
gradually
he
slackened
his
pace
drawing
and
cocking
his
revolver
then
he
turned
suddenly
to
confront
the
yelping
nemesis
behind
him
three
times
he
fired
in
quick
succession
at
a
moving
blot
in
the
and
there
went
up
from
that
blot
a
wailing
cry
that
he
knew
was
caused
by
the
deep
bite
of
lead
again
he
plunged
on
a
muffled
shout
of
defiance
on
his
lips
never
had
the
fire
of
battle
raged
in
his
veins
as
now
back
in
the
window
listening
in
terror
praying
for
him
was
meleese
the
knowledge
that
she
was
there
that
at
last
he
had
won
her
and
was
fighting
for
her
stirred
him
with
a
joy
that
was
next
to
madness
nothing
could
stop
him
now
he
loaded
his
revolver
as
he
ran
slackening
his
pace
as
he
covered
greater
distance
for
he
knew
that
in
the
storm
his
trail
could
be
followed
scarcely
faster
than
a
walk
he
gave
no
thought
to
jean
croisset
bound
hand
and
foot
in
the
little
cabin
on
the
mountain
even
as
he
had
clung
to
the
window
for
that
last
moment
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
it
would
be
folly
to
return
to
the
frenchman
meleese
had
promised
to
come
to
him
and
he
believed
her
and
for
that
reason
jean
was
no
longer
of
use
to
him
alone
he
would
lose
himself
in
that
wilderness
alone
work
his
way
into
the
south
trusting
to
his
revolver
for
food
and
to
his
compass
and
the
matches
in
his
pocket
for
life
there
would
be
no
for
his
enemies
to
follow
no
treachery
to
fear
it
would
take
a
thousand
men
to
find
him
after
the
night
storm
had
covered
up
his
retreat
and
if
one
should
find
him
they
two
would
be
alone
to
fight
it
out
for
a
moment
he
stopped
to
listen
and
stare
futilely
into
the
blackness
behind
him
when
he
turned
to
go
on
his
heart
stood
still
a
shadow
had
loomed
out
of
the
night
half
a
dozen
paces
ahead
of
him
and
before
he
could
raise
his
revolver
the
shadow
was
lightened
by
a
sharp
flash
of
fire
howland
staggered
back
his
fingers
loosening
their
grip
on
his
pistol
and
as
he
crumpled
down
into
the
snow
he
heard
over
him
the
hoarse
voice
that
had
urged
on
the
dog
after
that
there
was
a
space
of
silence
of
black
chaos
in
which
he
neither
reasoned
nor
lived
and
when
there
came
to
him
faintly
the
sound
of
other
voices
finally
all
of
them
were
lost
in
one
a
moaning
sobbing
voice
that
was
calling
his
name
again
and
again
a
voice
that
seemed
to
reach
to
him
from
out
of
an
infinity
of
distance
and
that
he
knew
was
the
voice
of
meleese
he
strove
to
speak
to
lift
his
arms
but
his
tongue
was
as
lead
his
arms
as
though
fettered
with
steel
bands
the
voice
died
away
he
lived
through
a
cycle
of
speechless
painless
night
into
which
finally
a
gleam
of
dawn
returned
he
felt
as
if
years
were
passing
in
his
efforts
to
move
to
lift
himself
out
of
chaos
but
at
last
he
won
his
eyes
opened
he
raised
himself
his
first
sensation
was
that
he
was
no
longer
in
the
snow
and
that
the
storm
was
not
beating
into
his
face
instead
there
encompassed
him
a
damp
chill
everywhere
there
was
blackness
everywhere
except
in
one
spot
where
a
little
yellow
eye
of
fire
watched
him
and
blinked
at
him
at
first
he
thought
that
the
eye
must
be
miles
and
miles
away
but
it
came
quickly
nearer
and
still
nearer
until
at
last
he
knew
that
it
was
a
candle
burning
with
the
silence
of
a
death
taper
a
yard
or
two
beyond
his
feet
chapter
xvi
jean
story
it
was
the
that
dragged
howland
quickly
back
into
consciousness
and
pain
he
knew
that
he
was
no
longer
in
the
snow
his
fingers
dug
into
damp
earth
as
he
made
an
effort
to
raise
himself
and
with
that
effort
it
seemed
as
though
a
knife
had
cleft
him
from
the
top
of
his
skull
to
his
chest
the
agony
of
that
instant
pain
drew
a
sharp
cry
from
him
and
he
clutched
both
hands
to
his
head
waiting
and
fearing
it
did
not
come
again
and
he
sat
up
a
hundred
candles
danced
and
blinked
before
him
like
so
many
taunting
eyes
and
turned
him
dizzy
with
a
sickening
nausea
one
by
one
the
lights
faded
away
after
that
until
there
was
left
only
the
steady
glow
of
the
real
candle
the
fingers
of
howland
right
hand
were
sticky
when
he
drew
them
away
from
his
head
and
he
shivered
the
tongue
of
flame
leaping
out
of
the
night
the
thunderous
report
the
deluge
of
fire
that
had
filled
his
brain
all
bore
their
meaning
for
him
now
it
had
been
a
close
call
so
close
that
shivering
chills
ran
up
and
down
his
spine
as
he
struggled
little
by
little
to
lift
himself
to
his
knees
his
enemy
shot
had
grazed
his
head
a
quarter
of
an
inch
more
an
eighth
of
an
inch
even
and
there
would
have
been
no
awakening
he
closed
his
eyes
for
a
few
moments
and
when
he
opened
them
his
vision
had
gained
distance
about
him
he
made
out
indistinctly
the
black
encompassing
walls
of
his
prison
it
seemed
an
interminable
time
before
he
could
rise
and
stand
on
his
feet
and
reach
the
candle
slowly
he
felt
his
way
along
the
wall
until
he
came
to
a
low
heavy
door
barred
from
the
outside
and
just
beyond
this
door
he
found
a
narrow
aperture
cut
through
the
decaying
logs
it
was
a
yard
in
length
and
barely
wide
enough
for
him
to
thrust
through
an
arm
three
more
of
these
narrow
slits
in
his
prison
walls
he
found
before
he
came
back
again
to
the
door
they
reminded
him
of
the
hole
through
which
he
had
looked
out
on
the
cabin
at
the
de
mort
and
he
guessed
that
through
them
came
what
little
fresh
air
found
its
way
into
the
dungeon
near
the
table
on
which
he
replaced
the
candle
was
a
stool
and
he
sat
down
carefully
he
went
through
his
pockets
his
belt
and
revolver
were
gone
he
had
been
stripped
of
letters
and
papers
not
so
much
as
a
match
had
been
left
him
by
his
captors
he
stopped
in
his
search
and
listened
faintly
there
came
to
him
the
ticking
of
his
watch
he
felt
in
his
watch
pocket
it
was
empty
again
he
listened
this
time
he
was
sure
that
the
sound
came
from
his
feet
and
he
lowered
the
candle
until
the
light
of
it
glistened
on
something
yellow
an
arm
distance
away
it
was
his
watch
and
close
beside
it
lay
his
leather
wallet
what
money
he
had
carried
in
the
pocketbook
was
untouched
but
his
personal
cards
and
half
a
dozen
papers
that
it
had
contained
were
gone
he
looked
at
the
time
the
hour
hand
pointed
to
four
was
it
possible
that
he
had
been
unconscious
for
more
than
six
hours
he
had
left
jean
on
the
mountain
top
soon
after
nightfall
it
was
not
later
than
nine
when
he
had
seen
meleese
seven
hours
again
he
lifted
his
hands
to
his
head
his
hair
was
stiff
and
matted
with
blood
it
had
congealed
thickly
on
his
cheek
and
neck
and
had
soaked
the
top
of
his
coat
he
had
bled
a
great
deal
so
much
that
he
wondered
he
was
alive
and
yet
during
those
hours
his
captors
had
given
him
no
assistance
had
not
even
bound
a
cloth
about
his
head
did
they
believe
that
the
shot
had
killed
him
that
he
was
already
dead
when
they
flung
him
into
the
dungeon
or
was
this
only
one
other
instance
of
the
barbaric
brutishness
of
those
who
so
insistently
sought
his
life
the
fighting
blood
rose
in
him
with
returning
strength
if
they
had
left
him
a
weapon
even
the
small
knife
they
had
taken
from
his
pocket
he
would
still
make
an
effort
to
settle
a
last
score
or
two
but
now
he
was
helpless
there
was
however
a
ray
of
hope
in
the
possibility
that
they
believed
him
dead
if
they
who
had
flung
him
into
the
dungeon
believed
this
then
he
was
safe
for
several
hours
no
one
would
come
for
his
body
until
broad
day
and
possibly
not
until
the
following
night
when
a
grave
could
be
dug
and
he
could
be
carried
out
with
some
secrecy
in
that
time
if
he
could
escape
from
his
prison
he
would
be
well
on
his
way
to
the
wekusko
he
had
no
doubt
that
jean
was
still
a
prisoner
on
the
mountain
top
the
dogs
and
sledge
were
there
and
both
rifles
were
where
he
had
concealed
them
it
would
be
a
hard
race
a
running
fight
perhaps
but
he
would
win
and
after
a
time
meleese
would
come
to
him
away
down
at
the
little
hotel
on
the
saskatchewan
he
rose
to
his
feet
his
blood
growing
warm
his
eyes
shining
in
the
the
thought
of
the
girl
as
she
had
come
to
him
out
in
the
night
put
back
into
him
all
of
his
old
fighting
strength
all
of
his
unconquerable
hope
and
confidence
she
had
followed
him
when
the
dog
yelped
at
his
heels
as
the
first
shots
had
been
fired
she
had
knelt
beside
him
in
the
snow
as
he
lay
bleeding
at
the
feet
of
his
enemies
he
had
heard
her
voice
calling
to
him
had
felt
the
thrilling
touch
of
her
arms
the
terror
and
love
of
her
lips
as
she
thought
him
dying
she
had
given
herself
to
him
and
she
would
come
to
him
his
lady
of
the
snows
if
he
could
escape
he
went
to
the
door
and
shoved
against
it
with
his
shoulder
it
was
immovable
again
he
thrust
his
hand
and
arm
through
the
first
of
the
narrow
ventilating
apertures
the
wood
with
which
his
fingers
came
in
contact
was
rotting
from
moisture
and
age
and
he
found
that
he
could
tear
out
handfuls
of
it
he
fell
to
work
digging
with
the
fierce
eagerness
of
an
animal
at
the
rate
the
soft
pulpy
wood
gave
way
he
could
win
his
freedom
long
before
the
earliest
risers
at
the
post
were
awake
a
sound
stopped
him
a
hollow
cough
from
out
of
the
blackness
beyond
the
dungeon
wall
it
was
followed
an
instant
later
by
a
gleam
of
light
and
howland
darted
quickly
back
to
the
table
he
heard
the
slipping
of
a
bolt
outside
the
door
and
it
flashed
on
him
then
that
he
should
have
thrown
himself
back
into
his
old
position
on
the
floor
it
was
too
late
for
this
action
now
the
door
swung
open
and
a
shaft
of
light
shot
into
the
chamber
for
a
space
howland
was
blinded
by
it
and
it
was
not
until
the
bearer
of
the
lamp
had
advanced
to
the
table
that
he
recognized
his
visitor
as
jean
croisset
the
frenchman
face
was
wild
and
haggard
his
eyes
gleamed
red
and
bloodshot
as
he
stared
at
the
engineer
i
had
hoped
to
find
you
dead
he
whispered
huskily
he
reached
up
to
hang
the
big
oil
lamp
he
carried
to
a
hook
in
the
log
ceiling
and
howland
sat
amazed
at
the
expression
on
his
face
great
eyes
gleamed
like
living
coals
from
out
of
a
either
fear
or
pain
had
wrought
deep
lines
in
his
face
his
hands
trembled
as
he
steadied
the
lamp
the
few
hours
that
had
passed
since
howland
had
left
him
a
prisoner
on
the
mountain
top
had
transformed
him
into
an
old
man
even
his
shoulders
were
hunched
forward
with
an
air
of
weakness
and
despair
as
he
turned
from
the
lamp
to
the
engineer
i
had
hoped
to
find
you
dead
he
repeated
in
a
voice
so
low
it
could
not
have
been
heard
beyond
the
door
that
is
why
i
did
not
bind
your
wound
and
give
you
water
when
they
turned
you
over
to
my
care
i
wanted
you
to
bleed
to
death
it
would
have
been
easier
for
both
of
us
from
under
the
table
he
drew
forth
a
second
stool
and
sat
down
opposite
howland
the
two
men
stared
at
each
other
over
the
sputtering
remnant
of
the
candle
before
the
engineer
had
recovered
from
his
astonishment
at
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
man
whom
he
believed
to
be
safely
imprisoned
in
the
old
cabin
croisset
shifting
eyes
fell
on
the
mass
of
torn
wood
under
the
aperture
too
late
he
said
meaningly
they
are
waiting
up
there
now
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
escape
that
is
what
i
thought
about
you
replied
howland
forcing
himself
to
speak
coolly
how
did
you
manage
it
they
came
up
to
free
me
soon
after
they
got
you
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
thinking
of
me
for
if
you
had
not
told
them
i
might
have
stayed
there
and
starved
like
a
beast
in
a
trap
it
was
meleese
said
howland
i
told
her
jean
dropped
his
head
in
his
hands
i
have
just
come
from
meleese
he
whispered
softly
she
sends
you
her
love
and
tells
you
not
to
give
up
hope
the
great
god
if
she
only
knew
if
she
only
knew
what
is
about
to
happen
no
one
has
told
her
she
is
a
prisoner
in
her
room
and
after
that
after
that
out
on
the
plain
when
she
came
to
you
and
fought
like
one
gone
mad
to
save
you
they
will
not
give
her
freedom
until
all
is
over
what
time
is
it
a
clammy
chill
passed
over
howland
as
he
read
the
time
four
the
frenchman
shivered
his
fingers
clasped
and
unclasped
nervously
as
he
leaned
nearer
his
companion
the
virgin
bear
me
witness
that
i
wish
i
might
strike
ten
years
off
my
life
and
give
you
freedom
he
breathed
quickly
i
would
do
it
this
instant
i
would
help
you
to
escape
if
it
were
in
any
way
possible
but
they
are
in
the
room
at
the
head
of
the
stair
waiting
at
six
something
seemed
to
choke
him
and
he
stopped
at
six
what
then
urged
howland
my
god
man
what
makes
you
look
so
what
is
to
happen
at
six
jean
stiffened
a
flash
of
the
old
fire
gleamed
in
his
eyes
and
his
voice
was
steady
and
clear
when
he
spoke
again
i
have
no
time
to
lose
in
further
talk
like
this
he
said
almost
harshly
they
know
now
that
it
was
i
who
fought
for
you
and
for
meleese
on
the
great
north
trail
they
know
that
it
is
i
who
saved
you
at
wekusko
meleese
can
no
more
save
me
than
she
can
save
you
and
to
make
my
task
a
little
harder
they
have
made
me
their
messenger
and
again
he
stopped
choking
for
words
what
insisted
howland
leaning
toward
him
his
face
as
white
as
the
tallow
in
the
little
dish
on
the
table
their
executioner
with
his
hands
gripped
tightly
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
jack
howland
sat
as
rigid
as
though
an
electric
shock
had
passed
through
him
great
god
he
gasped
first
i
am
to
tell
you
a
story
continued
croisset
leveling
his
reddened
eyes
to
the
engineer
it
will
not
be
long
and
i
pray
the
virgin
to
make
you
understand
it
as
we
people
of
the
north
understand
it
it
begins
sixteen
years
ago
i
shall
understand
jean
whispered
howland
go
on
it
was
at
one
of
the
company
posts
that
it
happened
jean
began
and
the
story
has
to
do
with
le
the
factor
and
his
wife
that
is
what
she
was
called
the
white
angel
how
we
loved
her
not
with
a
wicked
love
but
with
something
very
near
to
that
which
we
give
our
blessed
virgin
and
our
love
was
but
a
pitiful
thing
when
compared
with
the
love
of
these
two
each
for
the
other
she
was
beautiful
gloriously
beautiful
as
we
know
women
up
in
the
big
snows
like
meleese
who
was
the
youngest
of
their
children
ours
was
the
happiest
post
in
all
this
great
northland
continued
croisset
after
a
moment
pause
and
it
was
all
because
of
this
woman
and
the
man
but
mostly
because
of
the
woman
and
when
the
little
meleese
came
she
was
the
first
white
girl
baby
that
any
of
us
had
ever
seen
our
love
for
these
two
became
something
that
i
fear
was
almost
a
sacrilege
to
our
dear
lady
of
god
perhaps
you
can
not
understand
such
a
love
i
know
that
it
can
not
be
understood
down
in
that
world
which
you
call
civilization
for
i
have
been
there
and
have
seen
we
would
have
died
for
the
little
meleese
and
the
other
meleese
her
mother
and
also
we
would
have
killed
our
own
brothers
had
they
as
much
as
spoken
a
word
against
them
or
cast
at
the
mother
even
as
much
as
a
look
which
was
not
the
purest
that
is
how
we
loved
her
sixteen
years
ago
this
winter
and
that
is
how
we
love
her
memory
still
she
is
dead
uttered
howland
forgetting
in
these
tense
moments
the
significance
jean
story
might
hold
for
him
yes
she
is
dead
shall
i
tell
you
how
she
died
croisset
sprang
to
his
feet
his
eyes
flashing
his
lithe
body
twitching
like
a
wolf
as
he
stood
for
an
instant
half
leaning
over
the
engineer
shall
i
tell
you
how
she
died
he
repeated
falling
back
on
his
stool
his
long
arms
stretched
over
the
table
it
happened
like
this
sixteen
years
ago
when
the
little
meleese
was
four
years
old
and
the
oldest
of
the
three
sons
was
fourteen
that
winter
a
man
and
his
boy
came
up
from
churchill
he
had
letters
from
the
factor
at
the
bay
and
our
factor
and
his
wife
opened
their
doors
to
him
and
to
his
son
and
gave
them
all
that
it
was
in
their
power
to
give
this
man
was
from
that
glorious
civilization
of
yours
from
that
land
to
the
south
where
they
say
that
christ
temples
stand
on
every
four
corners
but
he
could
not
understand
the
strange
god
and
the
strange
laws
of
our
people
for
months
he
had
been
away
from
the
companionship
of
women
and
in
this
great
wilderness
the
factor
wife
came
into
his
life
as
the
flower
blossoms
in
the
desert
ah
i
can
see
now
how
his
wicked
heart
strove
to
accomplish
the
things
and
how
he
failed
because
the
glory
of
our
womanhood
up
here
has
come
straight
down
from
heaven
and
in
failing
he
went
mad
mad
with
that
passion
of
the
race
i
have
seen
in
montreal
and
then
ah
the
great
god
do
you
not
understand
what
happened
next
croisset
lifted
his
head
his
face
twisted
in
a
torture
that
was
half
grief
half
madness
and
stared
at
howland
with
quivering
nostrils
and
heaving
chest
in
his
companion
face
he
saw
only
a
dead
white
pallor
of
waiting
of
half
comprehension
he
leaned
over
the
table
again
controlling
himself
by
a
mighty
effort
it
was
at
that
time
when
most
of
us
were
out
among
the
trappers
just
before
our
big
spring
caribou
roast
when
the
forest
people
came
in
with
their
furs
the
post
was
almost
deserted
do
you
understand
the
woman
was
alone
in
her
cabin
with
the
little
meleese
and
when
we
came
back
at
night
she
was
dead
yes
she
killed
herself
leaving
a
few
written
words
to
the
factor
telling
him
what
had
happened
the
man
and
the
boy
escaped
on
a
sledge
after
the
crime
how
the
forest
people
leaped
in
pursuit
runners
carried
the
word
over
the
mountains
and
through
the
swamps
and
a
hundred
sledge
parties
searched
the
forest
trails
for
the
and
his
son
it
was
the
factor
himself
and
his
youngest
boy
who
found
them
far
out
on
the
churchill
trail
and
what
happened
then
just
this
while
the
urged
on
his
dogs
the
son
fired
back
with
a
rifle
and
one
of
his
bullets
went
straight
through
the
heart
of
the
pursuing
factor
so
that
in
the
space
of
one
day
and
one
night
the
little
meleese
was
made
both
motherless
and
fatherless
by
these
two
whom
the
devil
had
sent
to
destroy
the
most
beautiful
thing
we
have
ever
known
in
this
north
ah
you
turn
white
does
it
bring
a
vision
to
you
now
do
you
hear
the
crack
of
that
rifle
can
you
see
my
god
gasped
howland
even
now
he
understood
nothing
of
what
this
tragedy
might
mean
to
him
forgot
everything
but
that
he
was
listening
to
the
terrible
tragedy
that
had
come
to
the
woman
who
was
the
mother
of
the
girl
he
loved
he
half
rose
from
his
seat
as
croisset
paused
his
eyes
glittered
his
face
was
set
in
tense
fierce
lines
his
dug
into
the
board
table
as
he
demanded
what
happened
then
croisset
jean
was
eying
him
like
an
animal
his
voice
was
low
they
escaped
with
a
deep
breath
howland
sank
back
in
a
moment
he
leaned
again
toward
jean
as
he
saw
come
into
the
frenchman
eyes
a
slumbering
fire
that
a
few
seconds
later
blazed
into
vengeful
malignity
when
he
drew
slowly
from
an
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
a
small
parcel
wrapped
and
tied
in
soft
buckskin
they
have
sent
you
this
he
said
the
very
last
they
told
me
him
read
this
with
his
eyes
on
the
parcel
scarcely
breathing
howland
waited
while
with
exasperating
slowness
croisset
brown
fingers
untied
the
cord
that
secured
it
first
you
must
understand
what
this
meant
to
us
in
the
north
said
jean
his
hands
covering
the
parcel
after
he
had
finished
with
the
cord
we
are
different
who
live
up
here
different
from
those
who
live
in
montreal
and
beyond
with
us
a
lifetime
is
not
too
long
to
spend
in
avenging
a
cruel
wrong
it
is
our
honor
of
the
north
i
was
fifteen
then
and
had
been
fostered
by
the
factor
and
his
wife
since
the
day
my
mother
died
of
the
smallpox
and
i
dragged
myself
into
the
post
almost
dead
of
starvation
so
it
happened
that
i
was
like
a
brother
to
meleese
and
the
other
three
the
years
passed
and
the
desire
for
vengeance
grew
in
us
as
we
became
older
until
it
was
the
one
thing
that
we
most
desired
in
life
even
filling
the
gentle
heart
of
meleese
whom
we
sent
to
school
in
montreal
when
she
was
eleven
it
was
three
years
later
while
she
was
still
in
montreal
that
i
went
on
one
of
my
wandering
searches
to
a
post
at
the
head
of
the
great
slave
and
there
there
croisset
had
risen
his
long
arms
were
stretched
high
his
head
thrown
back
his
upturned
face
aflame
with
a
passion
that
was
almost
that
of
prayer
i
thank
the
great
god
in
heaven
that
it
was
given
to
jean
croisset
to
meet
one
of
those
whom
we
had
pledged
our
lives
to
find
and
i
slew
him
he
stood
silent
eyes
partly
closed
still
as
if
in
prayer
when
he
sank
into
his
chair
again
the
look
of
hatred
had
gone
from
his
face
it
was
the
father
and
i
killed
him
killed
him
slowly
telling
him
of
what
he
had
done
as
i
choked
the
life
from
him
and
then
a
little
at
a
time
i
let
the
life
back
into
him
forcing
him
to
tell
me
where
i
would
find
his
son
the
slayer
of
meleese
father
and
after
that
i
closed
on
his
throat
until
he
was
dead
and
my
dogs
dragged
his
body
through
three
hundred
miles
of
snow
that
the
others
might
look
on
him
and
know
that
he
was
dead
that
was
six
years
ago
howland
was
scarcely
breathing
and
the
other
the
son
he
whispered
densely
you
found
him
croisset
you
killed
him
what
would
you
have
done
howland
hands
gripped
those
that
guarded
the
little
parcel
i
would
have
killed
him
jean
he
spoke
slowly
deliberately
i
would
have
killed
him
he
repeated
i
am
glad
of
that
jean
was
unwrapping
the
buckskin
fold
after
fold
of
it
until
at
last
there
was
revealed
a
roll
of
paper
soiled
and
yellow
along
the
edges
these
pages
are
taken
from
the
at
the
post
where
the
woman
lived
he
explained
softly
smoothing
them
under
his
hands
each
day
the
factor
of
a
post
keeps
a
reckoning
of
incidents
as
they
pass
as
i
have
heard
that
sea
captains
do
on
shipboard
it
has
been
a
company
law
for
hundreds
of
years
we
have
kept
these
pages
to
ourselves
they
tell
of
what
happened
at
our
post
sixteen
years
ago
this
winter
as
he
spoke
the
came
to
howland
side
smoothing
the
first
page
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
his
slim
forefinger
pointing
to
the
first
few
lines
they
came
on
this
day
he
said
his
breath
close
to
the
ear
these
are
their
names
the
names
of
the
two
who
destroyed
the
paradise
that
our
blessed
lady
gave
to
us
many
years
ago
in
an
instant
howland
had
read
the
lines
his
blood
seemed
to
dry
in
his
veins
and
his
heart
to
stand
still
for
these
were
the
words
he
read
on
this
day
there
came
to
our
post
from
the
churchill
way
john
howland
and
his
son
with
a
sharp
cry
he
sprang
to
his
feet
overturning
the
stool
facing
croisset
his
hands
clenched
his
body
bent
as
if
about
to
spring
jean
stood
calmly
his
white
teeth
agleam
then
slowly
he
stretched
out
a
hand
john
howland
will
you
read
what
happened
to
the
father
and
mother
of
the
little
meleese
sixteen
years
ago
will
you
read
and
understand
why
your
life
was
sought
on
the
great
north
trail
why
you
were
placed
on
a
case
of
dynamite
in
the
wekusko
coyote
and
why
with
the
coming
of
this
morning
dawn
at
six
he
paused
shivering
howland
seemed
not
to
notice
the
tremendous
effort
croisset
was
making
to
control
himself
with
the
dazed
speechlessness
of
one
recovering
from
a
sudden
blow
he
turned
to
the
table
and
bent
over
the
papers
that
the
frenchman
had
laid
out
before
him
five
minutes
later
he
raised
his
head
his
face
was
as
white
as
chalk
deep
lines
had
settled
about
his
mouth
as
a
sick
man
might
he
lifted
his
hand
and
passed
it
over
his
face
and
through
his
hair
but
his
eyes
were
afire
involuntarily
jean
body
gathered
itself
as
if
to
meet
attack
i
have
read
it
he
said
huskily
as
though
the
speaking
of
the
words
caused
him
a
great
effort
i
understand
now
my
name
is
john
howland
and
my
father
name
was
john
howland
i
understand
there
was
silence
in
which
the
eyes
of
the
two
men
met
i
understand
repeated
the
engineer
advancing
a
step
and
you
jean
croisset
do
you
believe
that
i
am
john
howland
the
john
howland
the
son
who
he
stopped
waiting
for
jean
to
comprehend
to
speak
it
makes
no
difference
what
i
believe
now
i
have
but
one
other
thing
to
tell
you
here
and
one
thing
to
give
to
you
replied
jean
those
who
have
tried
to
kill
you
are
the
three
brothers
meleese
is
their
sister
ours
is
a
strange
country
governed
since
the
beginning
of
our
time
by
laws
which
we
have
made
ourselves
to
those
who
are
waiting
above
no
torture
is
too
great
for
you
they
have
condemned
you
to
death
this
morning
exactly
as
the
minute
hand
of
your
watch
counts
off
the
hour
of
six
you
will
be
shot
to
death
through
one
of
these
holes
in
the
dungeon
walls
and
this
this
note
from
meleese
is
the
last
thing
i
have
to
give
you
he
dropped
a
folded
bit
of
paper
on
the
table
mechanically
howland
reached
for
it
stunned
and
speechless
cold
with
the
horror
of
his
death
sentence
he
smoothed
out
the
note
there
were
only
a
few
words
apparently
written
in
great
haste
i
have
been
praying
for
you
all
night
if
god
fails
to
answer
my
prayers
i
will
still
do
as
i
have
promised
and
follow
you
meleese
he
heard
a
movement
and
lifted
his
eyes
jean
was
gone
the
door
was
swinging
slowly
inward
he
heard
the
wooden
bolt
slip
into
place
and
after
that
there
was
not
even
the
sound
of
a
moccasined
foot
stealing
through
the
outer
darkness
chapter
xvii
meleese
for
many
minutes
howland
stood
waiting
as
if
life
had
left
him
his
eyes
were
on
the
door
but
unseeing
he
made
no
sound
no
movement
again
toward
the
aperture
in
the
wall
fate
had
dealt
him
the
final
blow
and
when
at
last
he
roused
himself
from
its
first
terrible
effect
there
remained
no
glimmering
of
hope
in
his
breast
no
thought
of
the
battle
he
had
been
making
for
freedom
a
short
time
before
the
note
fluttered
from
his
fingers
and
he
drew
his
watch
from
his
pocket
and
placed
it
on
the
table
it
was
a
quarter
after
five
there
still
remained
minutes
of
an
hour
and
then
death
there
was
no
doubt
in
his
mind
this
time
ever
in
the
coyote
with
eternity
staring
him
in
the
face
he
had
hoped
and
fought
for
life
but
here
there
was
no
hope
there
was
to
be
no
fighting
through
one
of
the
black
holes
in
the
wall
he
was
to
be
shot
down
with
no
chance
to
defend
himself
to
prove
himself
innocent
and
meleese
did
she
too
believe
him
guilty
of
that
crime
he
groaned
aloud
and
picked
up
the
note
again
softly
he
repeated
her
last
words
to
him
if
god
fails
to
answer
my
prayers
i
will
still
do
as
i
have
promised
and
follow
you
those
words
seemed
to
cry
aloud
his
doom
even
meleese
had
given
up
hope
and
yet
was
there
not
a
deeper
significance
in
her
words
he
started
as
if
some
one
had
struck
him
his
eyes
agleam
will
follow
he
almost
sobbed
the
words
this
time
his
hands
trembled
and
he
dropped
the
paper
again
on
the
table
and
turned
his
eyes
in
staring
horror
toward
the
door
what
did
she
mean
would
meleese
kill
herself
if
he
was
murdered
by
her
brothers
he
could
see
no
other
meaning
in
her
last
message
to
him
and
for
a
time
after
the
chilling
significance
of
her
words
struck
his
heart
he
scarce
restrained
himself
from
calling
aloud
for
jean
if
he
could
but
send
a
word
back
to
her
tell
her
once
more
of
his
great
love
that
the
winning
of
that
love
was
ample
reward
for
all
that
he
had
lost
and
was
about
to
lose
and
that
it
gave
him
such
happiness
as
he
had
never
known
even
in
this
last
hour
of
his
torture
twice
he
shouted
for
croisset
but
there
came
no
response
save
the
hollow
echoings
of
his
own
voice
in
the
subterranean
chambers
after
that
he
began
to
think
more
sanely
if
meleese
was
a
prisoner
in
her
room
it
was
probable
that
croisset
who
was
now
fully
recognized
as
a
traitor
at
the
post
could
no
longer
gain
access
to
her
in
some
secret
way
meleese
had
contrived
to
give
him
the
note
and
he
had
performed
his
last
mission
for
her
in
howland
breast
there
grew
slowly
a
feeling
of
sympathy
for
the
frenchman
much
that
he
had
not
understood
was
clear
to
him
now
he
understood
why
meleese
had
not
revealed
the
names
of
his
assailants
at
prince
albert
and
wekusko
he
understood
why
she
had
fled
from
him
after
his
abduction
and
why
jean
had
so
faithfully
kept
secrecy
for
her
sake
she
had
fought
to
save
him
from
her
own
flesh
and
blood
and
jean
had
fought
to
save
him
and
in
these
last
minutes
of
his
life
he
would
liked
to
have
had
croisset
with
him
that
he
might
have
taken
has
hand
and
thanked
him
for
what
he
had
done
and
because
he
had
fought
for
him
and
meleese
the
frenchman
fate
was
to
be
almost
as
terrible
as
his
own
it
was
he
who
would
fire
the
fatal
shot
at
six
not
the
brothers
but
jean
croisset
would
be
his
executioner
and
murderer
the
minutes
passed
swiftly
and
as
they
went
howland
was
astonished
to
find
how
coolly
he
awaited
the
end
he
even
began
to
debate
with
himself
as
to
through
which
hole
the
fatal
shot
would
be
fired
no
matter
where
he
stood
he
was
in
the
light
of
the
big
hanging
lamp
there
was
no
obscure
or
shadowy
corner
in
which
for
a
few
moments
he
might
elude
his
executioner
he
even
smiled
when
the
thought
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
possible
to
extinguish
the
light
and
crawl
under
the
table
thus
gaining
a
momentary
delay
but
what
would
that
delay
avail
him
he
was
anxious
for
the
fatal
minute
to
arrive
and
be
over
there
were
moments
of
happiness
when
in
the
damp
horror
of
his
there
came
before
him
visions
of
meleese
grown
even
sweeter
and
more
lovable
now
that
he
knew
how
she
had
sacrificed
herself
between
two
great
loves
the
love
of
her
own
people
and
the
love
of
himself
and
at
last
she
had
surrendered
to
him
was
it
possible
that
she
could
have
made
that
surrender
if
she
like
her
brothers
believed
him
to
be
the
murderer
of
her
father
the
son
of
the
who
had
robbed
her
of
a
mother
it
was
impossible
he
told
himself
she
did
not
believe
him
guilty
and
yet
why
had
she
not
given
him
some
such
word
in
her
last
message
to
him
his
eyes
traveled
to
the
note
on
the
table
and
he
began
searching
in
his
coat
pockets
in
one
of
them
he
found
the
worn
stub
of
a
pencil
and
for
many
minutes
after
that
he
was
oblivious
to
the
passing
of
time
as
he
wrote
his
last
words
to
meleese
when
he
had
finished
he
folded
the
paper
and
placed
it
under
his
watch
at
the
final
moment
before
the
shot
was
fired
he
would
ask
jean
to
take
it
his
eyes
fell
on
his
watch
dial
and
a
cry
burst
from
his
lips
it
lacked
but
ten
minutes
of
the
final
hour
above
him
he
heard
faintly
the
sharp
barking
of
dogs
the
hollow
sound
of
men
voices
a
moment
later
there
came
to
him
an
echo
as
of
swiftly
tramping
feet
and
after
that
silence
jean
he
called
tensely
ho
jean
jean
croisset
he
caught
up
the
paper
and
ran
from
one
black
opening
to
another
calling
the
frenchman
name
as
you
love
your
god
jean
as
you
have
a
hope
of
heaven
take
this
note
to
meleese
he
pleaded
jean
jean
croisset
there
came
no
answer
no
movement
outside
and
howland
stilled
the
beating
of
his
heart
to
listen
surely
croisset
was
there
he
looked
again
at
the
watch
he
held
in
his
hand
in
four
minutes
the
shot
would
be
fired
a
cold
sweat
bathed
his
face
he
tried
to
cry
out
again
but
something
rose
in
his
throat
and
choked
him
until
his
voice
was
only
a
gasp
he
sprang
back
to
the
table
and
placed
the
note
once
more
under
the
watch
two
minutes
one
and
a
half
one
with
a
sudden
fearless
cry
he
sprang
into
the
very
center
of
his
prison
and
flung
out
his
arms
with
his
face
to
the
hole
next
the
door
this
time
his
voice
was
almost
a
shout
jean
croisset
there
is
a
note
under
my
watch
on
the
table
after
you
have
killed
me
take
it
to
meleese
if
you
fail
i
shall
haunt
you
to
your
grave
still
no
sound
no
gleam
of
steel
pointing
at
aim
through
the
black
aperture
would
the
shot
come
from
behind
tick
tick
tick
tick
he
counted
the
beating
of
his
watch
up
to
twenty
a
sound
stopped
him
then
and
he
closed
his
eyes
and
a
great
shiver
passed
through
his
body
it
was
the
tiny
bell
of
his
watch
tinkling
off
the
hour
of
six
scarcely
had
that
sound
ceased
to
ring
in
his
brain
when
from
far
through
the
darkness
beyond
the
wall
of
his
prison
there
came
a
creaking
noise
as
if
a
heavy
door
had
been
swung
slowly
on
its
hinges
or
a
trap
opened
then
voices
low
quick
excited
voices
the
hurrying
tread
of
feet
a
flash
of
light
shooting
through
the
gloom
they
were
coming
after
all
it
was
not
to
be
a
private
affair
and
jean
was
to
do
his
killing
as
the
hangman
job
is
done
in
civilization
before
a
crowd
howland
arms
dropped
to
his
side
this
was
more
terrible
than
the
other
this
seeing
and
hearing
of
preparation
in
which
he
fancied
that
he
heard
the
click
of
croisset
gun
as
he
lifted
the
hammer
instead
it
was
a
hand
fumbling
at
the
door
there
were
no
voices
now
only
a
strange
moaning
sound
that
he
could
not
account
for
in
another
moment
it
was
made
clear
to
him
the
door
swung
open
and
the
figure
of
meleese
sprang
toward
him
with
a
cry
that
echoed
through
the
dungeon
chambers
what
happened
then
the
passing
of
white
faces
beyond
the
doorway
the
subdued
murmur
of
voices
were
all
lost
to
howland
in
the
knowledge
that
at
the
last
moment
they
had
let
her
come
to
him
that
he
held
her
in
his
arms
and
that
she
was
crushing
her
face
to
his
breast
and
sobbing
things
to
him
which
he
could
not
understand
once
or
twice
in
his
life
he
had
wondered
if
realities
might
not
be
dreams
and
the
thought
came
to
him
now
when
he
felt
the
warmth
of
her
hands
her
face
her
hair
and
then
the
passionate
pressure
of
her
lips
on
his
own
he
lifted
his
eyes
and
in
the
doorway
he
saw
jean
croisset
and
behind
him
a
wild
bearded
face
the
face
that
had
been
over
him
when
life
was
almost
choked
from
him
on
the
great
north
trail
and
beyond
these
two
he
saw
still
others
shining
ghostly
and
indistinct
in
the
deeper
gloom
of
the
outer
darkness
he
strained
meleese
to
him
and
when
he
looked
down
into
her
face
he
saw
her
beautiful
eyes
flooded
with
tears
and
yet
shining
with
a
great
joy
her
lips
trembled
as
she
struggled
to
speak
then
suddenly
she
broke
from
his
arms
and
ran
to
the
door
and
jean
croisset
came
between
them
with
the
wild
bearded
man
still
staring
over
his
shoulder
will
you
come
with
us
said
jean
the
bearded
man
dropped
back
into
the
thick
gloom
and
without
speaking
howland
followed
croisset
his
eyes
on
the
shadowy
form
of
meleese
the
ghostly
faces
turned
from
the
light
and
the
tread
of
their
retreating
feet
marked
the
passage
through
the
blackness
jean
fell
back
beside
howland
the
huge
bulk
of
the
bearded
man
three
paces
ahead
a
dozen
steps
more
and
they
came
to
a
stair
down
which
a
light
shone
the
frenchman
hand
fell
detainingly
on
howland
arm
and
when
a
moment
later
they
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
all
had
disappeared
but
jean
and
the
bearded
man
dawn
was
breaking
and
a
pale
light
fell
through
the
two
windows
of
the
room
they
had
entered
on
a
table
burned
a
lamp
and
near
the
table
were
several
chairs
to
one
of
these
croisset
motioned
the
engineer
and
as
howland
sat
down
the
bearded
man
turned
slowly
and
passed
through
a
door
jean
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
the
other
disappeared
that
means
that
he
leaves
it
all
to
me
he
exclaimed
i
do
wonder
that
it
is
hard
for
him
to
talk
perhaps
you
have
begun
to
understand
yes
a
little
replied
howland
his
heart
was
throbbing
as
if
he
had
just
finished
climbing
a
long
hill
that
was
the
man
who
tried
to
kill
me
but
meleese
the
he
could
go
no
further
scarce
breathing
he
waited
for
jean
to
speak
it
is
pierre
thoreau
he
said
eldest
brother
to
meleese
it
is
he
who
should
say
what
i
am
about
to
tell
you
but
he
is
too
full
of
grief
to
speak
you
wonder
at
that
and
yet
i
tell
you
that
a
man
with
a
better
soul
than
pierre
thoreau
never
lived
though
three
times
he
has
tried
to
kill
you
do
you
remember
what
you
asked
me
a
short
time
ago
if
i
thought
that
were
the
john
howland
who
murdered
the
father
of
meleese
sixteen
years
ago
god
saints
and
i
did
until
hardly
more
than
half
an
hour
ago
when
some
one
came
from
the
south
and
exploded
a
mine
under
our
feet
it
was
the
youngest
of
the
three
brothers
we
have
made
a
great
mistake
and
we
ask
your
forgiveness
in
the
silence
the
eyes
of
the
two
men
met
across
the
table
to
howland
it
was
not
the
thought
that
his
life
was
saved
that
came
with
the
greatest
force
but
the
thought
of
meleese
the
knowledge
that
in
that
hour
when
all
seemed
to
be
lost
she
was
nearer
to
him
than
ever
he
leaned
half
over
the
table
his
hands
clenched
his
eyes
blazing
jean
did
not
understand
for
he
went
on
quickly
i
know
it
is
hard
perhaps
it
will
be
impossible
for
you
to
forgive
a
thing
like
this
we
have
tried
to
kill
you
kill
you
by
a
slow
torture
as
we
thought
you
deserved
but
think
for
a
moment
of
what
happened
up
here
sixteen
years
ago
this
winter
i
have
told
you
how
i
choked
life
from
the
so
i
would
have
choked
life
from
you
if
it
had
not
been
for
meleese
i
too
am
guilty
only
six
years
ago
we
knew
that
the
right
john
howland
the
son
of
the
man
i
slew
was
in
montreal
and
we
sent
to
seek
him
this
youngest
brother
for
he
had
been
a
long
time
at
school
with
meleese
and
knew
the
ways
of
the
south
better
than
the
others
but
he
failed
to
find
him
at
that
time
and
it
was
only
a
short
while
ago
that
this
brother
located
you
as
our
blessed
lady
is
my
witness
it
is
not
strange
that
he
should
have
taken
you
for
the
man
we
sought
for
it
is
singular
that
you
bear
him
out
like
a
brother
in
looks
as
i
remember
the
boy
it
is
true
that
francois
made
a
great
error
when
he
sent
word
to
his
brothers
suggesting
that
if
either
gregson
or
thorne
was
put
out
of
the
way
you
would
probably
be
sent
into
the
north
i
swear
by
the
virgin
that
meleese
knew
nothing
of
this
she
knew
nothing
of
the
schemes
by
which
her
brothers
drove
gregson
and
thorne
back
into
the
south
they
did
not
wish
to
kill
them
and
yet
it
was
necessary
to
do
something
that
you
might
replace
one
of
them
they
did
not
make
a
move
alone
but
that
something
happened
gregson
lost
a
finger
thorne
was
badly
hurt
as
you
know
bullets
came
through
their
window
at
night
with
jackpine
in
their
employ
it
was
easy
to
work
on
them
and
it
was
not
long
before
they
sent
down
asking
for
another
man
to
replace
them
for
the
first
time
a
surge
of
anger
swept
through
howland
the
cowards
he
exclaimed
a
pretty
pair
croisset
to
crawl
out
from
under
a
trap
to
let
another
in
at
the
top
perhaps
not
so
bad
as
that
said
jean
they
were
given
to
understand
that
they
and
they
alone
were
not
wanted
in
the
country
it
may
be
that
they
did
not
think
harm
would
come
to
you
and
so
kept
quiet
about
what
had
happened
it
may
be
too
that
they
did
not
like
to
have
it
known
that
they
were
running
away
from
danger
is
not
that
human
anyway
you
were
detailed
to
come
and
not
until
then
did
meleese
know
of
all
that
had
occurred
the
frenchman
stopped
for
a
moment
the
glare
had
faded
from
eyes
the
tense
lines
in
his
face
relaxed
i
i
believe
i
understand
everything
now
jean
he
said
you
traced
the
wrong
john
howland
that
all
i
love
meleese
jean
i
would
kill
john
howland
for
her
i
want
to
meet
her
brothers
and
shake
their
hands
i
do
blame
them
they
men
but
somehow
it
hurts
to
think
of
her
of
meleese
as
as
almost
a
murderer
has
she
not
saved
your
life
listen
to
this
it
was
then
when
she
knew
what
had
happened
that
meleese
came
to
me
whom
she
had
made
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
because
it
was
she
who
brought
my
mariane
over
from
churchill
on
a
visit
especially
that
i
might
see
her
and
fall
in
love
with
her
which
i
did
meleese
came
to
me
to
jean
croisset
and
instead
of
planning
your
murder
she
schemed
to
save
your
life
with
me
who
would
have
cut
you
into
bits
no
larger
than
my
finger
and
fed
you
to
the
carrion
ravens
who
would
have
choked
the
life
out
of
you
until
your
eyes
bulged
in
death
as
i
choked
that
one
up
on
the
great
slave
do
you
understand
it
was
meleese
who
came
and
pleaded
with
me
to
save
your
life
before
you
had
left
chicago
before
she
had
heard
more
of
you
than
your
name
before
croisset
hesitated
and
stopped
before
what
jean
before
she
had
learned
to
love
you
god
bless
her
exclaimed
howland
you
believe
this
as
i
believe
in
a
god
then
i
will
tell
you
what
she
did
he
continued
in
a
low
voice
the
plan
of
the
brothers
was
to
make
you
a
prisoner
near
prince
albert
and
bring
you
north
i
knew
what
was
to
happen
then
it
was
to
be
a
beautiful
vengeance
a
slow
torturing
death
on
the
spot
where
the
crime
was
committed
sixteen
years
ago
but
meleese
knew
nothing
of
this
she
was
made
to
believe
that
up
here
where
the
mother
and
father
died
you
would
be
given
over
to
the
proper
law
to
the
mounted
police
who
come
this
way
now
and
then
she
is
only
a
girl
easily
made
to
believe
strange
things
in
such
matters
as
these
else
she
would
have
wondered
why
you
were
not
given
to
the
officers
in
prince
albert
it
was
the
eldest
brother
who
thought
of
her
as
a
lure
to
bring
you
out
of
the
town
into
their
hands
and
not
until
the
last
moment
when
they
were
ready
to
leave
for
the
south
did
she
overhear
words
that
aroused
her
suspicions
that
they
were
about
to
kill
you
it
was
then
that
she
came
to
me
and
you
jean
on
the
day
that
mariane
promised
to
become
my
wife
i
promised
in
our
blessed
lady
name
to
repay
my
debt
to
meleese
and
the
manner
of
payment
came
in
this
fashion
jackpine
too
was
her
slave
and
so
we
worked
together
two
hours
after
meleese
and
her
brothers
had
left
for
the
south
i
was
following
them
shaven
of
beard
and
so
changed
that
i
was
not
recognized
in
the
fight
on
the
great
north
trail
meleese
thought
that
her
brothers
would
make
you
a
prisoner
that
night
without
harming
you
her
brothers
told
her
how
to
bring
you
to
their
camp
she
knew
nothing
of
the
ambush
until
they
leaped
on
you
from
cover
not
until
after
the
fight
when
in
their
rage
at
your
escape
the
brothers
told
her
that
they
had
intended
to
kill
you
did
she
realize
fully
what
she
had
done
that
is
all
you
know
what
happened
after
that
she
dared
not
tell
you
at
wekusko
who
your
enemies
were
for
those
enemies
were
of
her
own
flesh
and
blood
and
dearer
to
her
than
life
she
was
between
two
great
loves
the
love
for
her
brothers
and
again
jean
hesitated
and
her
love
for
me
finished
howland
yes
her
love
for
you
the
two
men
rose
from
the
table
and
for
a
moment
stood
with
clasped
hands
in
the
smoky
light
of
lamp
and
dawn
in
that
moment
neither
heard
a
tap
at
the
door
leading
to
the
room
beyond
nor
saw
the
door
move
gently
inward
and
meleese
hesitating
framed
in
the
opening
it
was
howland
who
spoke
first
i
thank
god
that
all
these
things
have
happened
jean
he
said
earnestly
i
am
glad
that
for
a
time
you
took
me
for
that
other
john
howland
and
that
pierre
thoreau
and
his
brothers
schemed
to
kill
me
at
prince
albert
and
wekusko
for
if
these
things
had
not
occurred
as
they
have
i
would
never
have
seen
meleese
and
now
jean
his
ears
caught
sound
of
movement
and
he
turned
in
time
to
see
meleese
slipping
quietly
out
meleese
he
called
softly
meleese
in
an
instant
he
had
darted
after
her
leaving
jean
beside
the
table
beyond
the
door
there
was
only
the
breaking
gloom
of
the
gray
mornings
but
it
was
enough
for
him
to
see
faintly
the
figure
of
the
girl
he
loved
half
turned
half
waiting
for
him
with
a
cry
of
joy
he
sprang
forward
and
gathered
her
close
in
his
arms
meleese
my
meleese
he
whispered
after
that
there
came
no
sound
from
the
room
beyond
but
jean
croisset
still
standing
by
the
table
murmured
softly
to
himself
our
blessed
lady
be
praised
for
it
is
all
as
jean
croisset
would
have
it
and
now
i
can
go
to
my
mariane
